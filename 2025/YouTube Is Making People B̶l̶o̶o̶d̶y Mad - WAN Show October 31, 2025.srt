[0.00 → 6.80] welcome to the wan show everybody we got lots of topics here for you today
[6.80 → 14.10] Luke house robots are almost here that's kind of crazy no yeah and YouTube is bringing updates
[14.10 → 22.84] surely that'll go great right probably not also uh we've got Marc Andreessen funding AI powered
[22.84 → 29.60] astroturf because we needed more bad things in the world I guess and Nintendo may have lost
[29.60 → 37.10] a key patent in Japan that's crazy you know what else is crazy is this intro from Nokia
[59.60 → 69.22] the show is brought to you today by sale Euro ubiquity and server.pro and of course
[69.22 → 74.52] that's alongside our rap partner brand our chair partner secret lab and our laptop partner dell
[74.52 → 79.80] the laptops are hiding a little bit today they're hiding behind our spooky vision skull, but that's
[79.80 → 84.54] okay yeah you can imagine that they're there they're powering the reliable way that we're
[84.54 → 88.16] going to be able to go through the wan doc with you guys and enjoy all these wonderful topics
[88.16 → 92.86] why don't we kick things right off with the big YouTube news this week
[92.86 → 100.44] how do they manage to do this it's almost like they try to make the most unpopular possible
[100.44 → 105.40] decisions I mean we had that one thing recently where I was like oh that seems pretty cool where
[105.40 → 111.22] they had the AI powered likeness recognition so you could opt out of having AI slop using your
[111.22 → 115.36] likeness all over the platform that was cool that seemed pretty cool that seemed like objectively
[115.36 → 120.90] good, and then they followed up with a triple whammy worth of updates and policy changes
[120.90 → 130.42] with an AI super resolution upscale that's planned to be applied to all videos under 1080p
[130.42 → 135.56] oh was it all videos or all live streams okay I seem to remember seeing an email about live streams but
[135.56 → 143.26] this says videos so that's interesting as well as a crackdown on both violent video games and
[143.26 → 150.88] gambling content this expanded crackdown which goes into effect November 17th is paired with more
[150.88 → 156.32] stringent age verification will prohibit content that directs viewers to online gambling sites
[156.32 → 161.26] which now includes digital goods gambling like video game skins cosmetics and NFTs
[161.26 → 169.60] oh wow and YouTube will also be age restricting casino style games without real world monetary value
[169.60 → 177.16] big g is also adding broader criteria for violent video game content that will be age restricted such as
[177.16 → 185.26] scenes of torture or mass violence against non-combatants, so this is a bunch to unpack let's start
[185.26 → 192.58] with the stuff that I wholeheartedly agree with YouTube does not need to direct people to online gambling
[192.58 → 197.08] sites if anything I think the professional sports space could stand to learn a little bit from YouTube here
[197.08 → 202.50] has YouTube not been taking advertising from gambling sites see they have which is why I'm finding the
[202.50 → 208.90] whole thing kind of confusing so rules for thee and not for me yeah but can I just take this as a small
[208.90 → 214.72] I don't think so it's not really a win is it is really feels like maybe they're just trying to take all the
[214.72 → 224.46] pie from gambling site funding right but from which country is it American pie is it
[224.46 → 231.56] i also I'm just recognizing that you don't have a Halloween costume which is a Halloween costume
[231.56 → 235.50] because other people dressed up as you so if you dressed up in a Halloween costume would actually
[235.50 → 241.38] kind of screw the whole thing up which is like the most amazing loophole ever and I'm just i I think
[241.38 → 244.10] very good I went as a tech YouTuber
[244.10 → 255.26] there you go um okay yeah and then so we've also got the bit where you're not allowed to direct
[255.26 → 260.24] viewers so, so yeah you can't direct viewers to online gambling sites which now includes
[260.24 → 267.98] video game skins cosmetics and NFTs I mean oh man how do we uh okay because I do i i i
[267.98 → 273.42] actually do support that because it was clear that nobody else was going to do anything about it
[273.42 → 279.38] and so it feels like for YouTube to step in and go yeah no you actually can't do that
[279.38 → 286.96] uh i I like that i also honestly really like the idea of age restricting casino style games even if
[286.96 → 292.40] they don't have real world monetary value i I do think that there's a level of extreme that's not
[292.40 → 296.34] necessary like I don't know if you remember this, but a little while back there was some controversy
[296.34 → 302.72] around like even Pokémon blue getting banned somewhere because there was the casino has a
[302.72 → 308.18] casino in it um seems a little much yeah that that seems a little bit much it's not a core mechanic i
[308.18 → 313.30] if I remember correctly I would just skip it every single time yeah because you lose all your money
[313.30 → 320.62] yeah um but like in general i I think i I've spoken extensively enough in the past about
[320.62 → 327.38] my frustration with gambling mechanics being introduced to children in everywhere from video
[327.38 → 335.74] games to real world settings um like the collectibles yeah happy meals even arcades right like you think
[335.74 → 340.34] you're playing a game of skill what you're actually playing is a game of chance, and you are putting in
[340.34 → 345.28] a bunch of money than at the end you get a little dopamine rush you know barrel of monkeys or
[345.28 → 350.80] whatever toy, and you go wow I won but what you actually did was lose and like I've had to have
[350.80 → 357.20] that conversation with my kids where they go oh yeah the best deal in the castle fun park prize bin is
[357.20 → 362.40] is this or this I'm like actually the best deal is if mommy and daddy had just spent the money that we
[362.40 → 370.94] spent on these gambling games and just bought you a barrel of monkeys um but of course you know that
[370.94 → 376.62] wouldn't have been as fun we just need to recognize it for what it is paying an amount of money to have
[376.62 → 382.76] the amount of fun that was playing these games the prize is not a prize it's a sucker prize which
[382.76 → 398.82] sometimes is a sucker if you like lollies could be all right candy oh, oh um anyway does anybody know
[398.82 → 406.76] if YouTube does allow gambling ads like on the site i I don't I have YouTube premiums so i I wouldn't
[406.76 → 412.16] really see stuff like that like can you too like do you get ads for like i I don't know what's a
[412.16 → 417.40] gambling thing poker stars is that still a thing I have no idea i I have no idea what's what's one of
[417.40 → 424.64] the sports betting I don't know what it is oh okay yeah okay in April says it's all gambling ads
[424.64 → 429.76] yeah they've seen stake ads seen draft kings okay yeah oh yeah yeah yeah draft kings that's one of
[429.76 → 437.08] the ones um okay cool so yeah it mans this does feel a little bit of rules for the and not for me but then
[437.08 → 439.10] again it is
[439.10 → 454.42] okay if I can try to uh I don't know devil's advocate is the right term for this
[454.42 → 459.52] if I can try to vouch for them a little bit which I don't necessarily think this is accurate but if i
[459.52 → 467.34] can um maybe they think at least that they can control the narrative around their ads more maybe
[467.34 → 474.48] they can target it to the the right people the right people being adults maybe they think
[474.48 → 480.54] that they can do that stuff a little bit better than creators just being unable to because they're
[480.54 → 485.22] just blasting their video out there, and then you know what I'm going to take I'm going to take this as a
[485.22 → 493.58] small win still then because they could get even more money because they could sell tar
[493.58 → 500.78] like gambling content target hold on just a second they could sell gambling targeted gambling ads
[500.78 → 506.80] against gambling content and there would be more money in it for them if they allowed that content to
[506.80 → 513.44] go to the broadest possible audience versus if they restricted it in any way tiny w I'm
[513.44 → 521.42] talking like I'm talking like three point okay on an enlarged sheet of paper like on an industrial
[521.42 → 529.82] printer okay, but there is a tiny w in their small w I don't know because I think the gambling content
[529.82 → 535.30] still happens because a lot of a lot of original back in the day style and I'm sure this still happens
[535.30 → 543.54] gambling you know creator monetization was gambling sites giving people a ton of money to gamble on
[543.54 → 552.76] their site um so it was like in a lot of cases undisclosed sponsorship effectively um and then actual
[552.76 → 558.10] just sponsorship what they're cracking down on is linking not making that content I believe
[558.10 → 564.86] digital goods blah blah blah which will prohibit content that directs viewers to it, I mean directs
[564.86 → 569.90] viewers and they will also age restrict casino style games without real world monetary value it's
[569.90 → 577.72] like no i so casino style games without real world monetary value so it could still have real world
[577.72 → 583.88] monetary value if it was a real casino, and they're only actually restricting you from linking to it
[583.88 → 591.06] so to my interpretation you can still make that content you just can't link to the site that you're
[591.06 → 591.58] playing on
[591.58 → 597.62] does it say link or direct it says directs
[597.62 → 604.60] strengthened approach okay here I'm going to bring up the original source okay prohibits content that
[604.60 → 608.54] directs viewers to online gambling sites or applications that are not certified by google
[608.54 → 612.38] so yeah it comes down to certified by Google is very different wording than what we had in the
[612.38 → 618.42] in the dark uh including digital goods yep yep yep social casino content
[618.42 → 630.36] okay, okay graphic game yeah yeah it's i have to be honest with you, it's pretty it's pretty hand wavy
[630.36 → 636.28] um it seems like there's a lot of room for interpretation here which it's going to have to be
[636.28 → 642.02] is in their defence yeah it's pretty much what you have to do when you create site guidelines I mean
[642.02 → 649.82] this is not a law right google is not the law um and if you make it super specific people will just
[649.82 → 655.50] work around it is happened to twitch, and they just became a laughingstock you like have to do it vaguely
[655.50 → 661.86] unfortunately um so we'll see what that actually turns into the violence in video game one is
[661.86 → 666.50] interesting okay well that one I wanted to unpack a little bit separately sure let's move on to it
[666.50 → 671.38] you know what you're right yep let's talk about I saw some speculation online that this was preemptive
[671.38 → 678.68] uh for the GTA 6 launch oh which actually yeah I had basically the same reaction of like
[678.68 → 683.48] interesting because you know there's going to be an insane flood of content whether I mean
[683.48 → 687.96] it's probably going to be good but whether the game is good or not an incredible amount of people will
[687.96 → 692.48] play it and there will be an incredible amount of content made about it yeah and a lot of it will
[692.48 → 699.94] probably include scenes of doing things to NPCs that could constitute well torture or mass violence
[699.94 → 708.40] against non-combatants yeah honestly everything there will also be gambling um like right there
[708.40 → 713.66] will also be the skins there will also be like literally everything in this update will have
[713.66 → 721.50] something to do with GTA oh that actually makes a ton of sense who knows but i I saw that
[721.50 → 727.58] idea, and it seemed super legit to me um it also could just be something that's been on the docket
[727.58 → 733.28] basically forever, and they've been waiting for a quiet moment to just kind of make these changes
[733.28 → 740.74] and yeah and roll them out i uh i I was not expecting this to ever happen and i have to tell you
[740.74 → 748.64] some of our content would fall under these guidelines as uh potentially being age gated which oh is sort of
[748.64 → 755.98] a downer because this is the next section like what this means for you and your content
[755.98 → 762.28] uploaded before November 17th 2025 that violates these guidelines may be removed or age restricted
[762.28 → 768.68] but will not result in a strike remember age restricted videos can stay on your channel for 18 plus
[768.68 → 779.04] audiences uh so I tend to content do you think would get whenever we fire up cyberpunk just as like a
[779.04 → 781.10] benchmark I tend to play Armageddon
[781.10 → 790.08] because then I don't have to aim, and we can just kind of you know rip around in the city and
[790.08 → 796.12] and it attracts the police which gives me an opportunity to get into a firefight like it just is its kind of
[796.12 → 800.34] it's not necessarily a scene of torture, but it's definitely mass violence against non-combatants
[800.34 → 805.26] yeah it really isn't it yeah see I always thought of them as just sort of digital pixels I didn't really
[805.26 → 814.42] you know think it mattered non-combatant yeah yeah um, so this could affect a not totally insignificant
[814.42 → 824.86] number of our older videos you should find a like generic clip of like some like I don't know
[824.86 → 829.46] what's that there was some like terrible flash game back in the day when you took care of like horses
[829.46 → 836.80] you just like brushed horses you should get like footage of that it's like every time you go to
[836.80 → 839.90] Armageddon spree it just like covers the screen with
[839.90 → 845.24] YouTube appropriate content um
[845.24 → 854.50] yeah um I don't know so you can make edits uh YouTube does have their built-in video editor
[854.50 → 860.78] tool you can use to uh trim or blur the footage, but you'd have to make any changes before November 17th
[860.78 → 865.82] uh so we would have to find whatever videos have this we'd have to go in and I think realistically I'm
[865.82 → 872.26] just gonna not bother and then anything that they flag on us, we're just going to appeal and then fix in
[872.26 → 879.00] the meantime, and then we'll hopefully sort it out that way uh there are some there are some sort
[879.00 → 885.44] guidelines that they use to determine whether it's violative of their policy so the duration
[885.44 → 892.54] matters if the graphic scene is sustained rather than fleeting um so for compilation videos they will
[892.54 → 898.16] now consider the cumulative duration of all the graphic clips combined okay um and then there's
[898.16 → 903.76] prominence so if the violent imagery is zoomed in or is the main focus of the scene
[903.76 → 909.86] and this one bones me a little if they're is it's against realistic human characters
[909.86 → 916.12] yeah it's a small portion of the video though yeah so maybe we'll do some credit there
[916.12 → 918.44] yep some social credit you know
[918.44 → 926.46] I was just in China so I had social credit on the mind here I found a YouTube YouTube acceptable game
[926.46 → 931.28] you just run around you collect carrots jump
[931.28 → 944.38] we did it yay oh wait more carrots jump I'm gonna oh no I made it I actually don't think this is
[944.38 → 950.42] acceptable I learned recently visiting the bunny café in Vancouver with my daughter that carrots are
[950.42 → 955.76] actually too sweet for bunnies are they too sweet for horses not healthy oh
[955.76 → 963.56] so no what are they supposed to eat no good root vegetables they can eat leafy greens okay yep
[963.56 → 967.96] and probably other things but they said carrots are too sweet not good for them
[967.96 → 974.32] there are bunny cafés yes there are bunny cafés this one's not one of the depressing ones where
[974.32 → 981.04] like the animals are abused and stuff though they work as a like a shelter and rehoming service so
[981.04 → 986.84] when you go in all the bunnies that are in there can be adopted which is pretty cool so
[986.84 → 992.20] yeah uh I don't I don't remember what it's called I feel like I should look it up now, but it's like
[992.20 → 997.20] the bunny café in Vancouver carrots seem to be good for horses oh that's nice it's called the bunny café
[997.20 → 1003.26] oh fantastic 1696 Venables street there you go bunny café pretty chill they seem like cool people
[1003.26 → 1010.72] I've never been to a cat café because I live in one stale biscuit asked
[1010.72 → 1019.10] we have four cats living in our house right now uh does Evan drink coffee not a café then neither of
[1019.10 → 1025.82] you drink coffee we have coffee oh just in case someone visits I mean technically you walk into a
[1025.82 → 1032.50] Starbucks nobody's actually drinking coffee is it still a café I say yes well because they have coffee so
[1032.50 → 1039.86] they have coffee having coffee yeah sure we have coffee fair enough got him uh okay we do have
[1039.86 → 1045.78] some now I get to uh tell the local government about Linus's illegal café business in his house would
[1045.78 → 1052.36] you like to watch the tech linked example of the AI sharpening yeah so the super resolution upscale
[1052.36 → 1056.66] absolutely all right here we go can we see this yeah well I hope so
[1056.66 → 1061.70] that's fine I don't think we need audio it's more of a visual experience
[1061.70 → 1068.42] oh my god unskiable is it a visual experience Linus it's a visual experience what am I even watching
[1068.42 → 1076.18] an ad for Disneyland is my guest nope Disneyland uh okay so hold on a second first things first oh is
[1076.18 → 1080.98] this just the same thing that we saw months ago that Riley talked about months ago
[1080.98 → 1089.06] hmm is this months ago yeah hold on that's not what I thought this was I assumed this was
[1089.06 → 1097.62] different opt-out AI super res all videos under 1080p as well as a crackdown uh hold on okay
[1098.82 → 1103.06] I need to double-check something to make sure that I don't say something that I can't say
[1103.06 → 1116.10] YouTube debuts AI enhanced super resolution for low res videos blah blah blah high resolution
[1116.10 → 1123.06] derivatives blah blah blah blah will clearly indicate them as super resolution leaving the originals intact
[1124.42 → 1129.14] okay in the case of offending videos creators can opt out
[1129.14 → 1136.90] okay blah blah blah blah so YouTube produces additional HD copies of a low res source of
[1136.90 → 1142.34] material gives you the option of using them in the quality menu next to the originals so no
[1142.34 → 1149.30] understanding is that this is not shorts directed it may be using the same technology which is maybe why
[1150.26 → 1158.18] Riley linked it like that, but it will look like this so we may have to go source ourselves a new
[1158.18 → 1165.38] example of this uh maybe we could try Charlie bit my finger and see if it has been if it has been AI
[1165.38 → 1170.34] super resolution but I went to the zoo you could try that one to that would be a that would be a great
[1171.22 → 1178.10] example of something that might have a thing Charlie bit my finger original does not
[1178.82 → 1184.74] have any super resolution neither does me at the zoo all right if anyone finds one go ahead and throw it in
[1184.74 → 1189.62] the chat, and then we can have a look at it after is it rolled out already or are they just saying
[1189.62 → 1190.50] they're going to roll it out
[1193.14 → 1196.90] YouTube debuts yeah has anyone else actually seen it
[1199.46 → 1203.94] is there a time frame for this I mean they definitely rolled it out on shorts
[1203.94 → 1213.38] there's going to be a lot of content that is not going to benefit too much from this like any kind of like
[1213.38 → 1220.34] pixel art style gaming videos um I don't think anyone's seen it I don't think it's really out much yet
[1220.34 → 1226.02] or if at all oh, oh hold on a second uh
[1228.98 → 1232.42] okay this there's no way that this doesn't have it
[1233.94 → 1244.74] oh no, no no
[1247.94 → 1255.14] what someone linked the old badger badger badger song and I was like oh no way like
[1255.14 → 1258.50] that one has it so I went to go check it no they just linked it for fun I think
[1258.50 → 1266.34] it's like nice it doesn't have there's no it's just like auto 240 and 144 all right well it was worth
[1266.34 → 1272.34] a shot whoa, whoa hold on when bingo chronicled says Charlie bit my finger has it for me
[1272.34 → 1278.98] uh okay so it's an it's a user rollout thing oh that's a bummer
[1281.14 → 1284.98] hold on a second they sent two links oh Imgur link here we go
[1284.98 → 1294.58] yeah so that's what that's what it looks like for you hey interesting that the even lower ones don't
[1294.58 → 1300.90] have its trays and Terrassa uh do we have like a side by side
[1300.90 → 1312.42] cat OS says try this one of course it is because of course it is thanked you for that very useful
[1313.46 → 1320.18] also this is already a 4k remaster, so there would be no need for them to upscale it again
[1322.90 → 1328.90] man it's been a while it's been a while since anyone has um helpfully linked that particular
[1328.90 → 1331.38] absolute banger of a music video
[1334.10 → 1341.06] I think we can move on now it is kind of a banger isn't if it's a solidly good song oh yeah no, no doubt
[1341.06 → 1347.94] yeah absolutely love it and wholesome to you know like yeah yeah yeah
[1349.78 → 1355.30] like why do songs about you know being attracted to members of the opposite sex have to be all
[1355.30 → 1366.26] all you know vulgar are the same sex ones not vulgar I mean not inherently why you have to
[1366.26 → 1372.66] no they're not no why because why do you why do you single out opposite sex well because that's what
[1372.66 → 1378.10] never going to give you up is about I assume there's a there's a lady in the video sure yeah
[1378.10 → 1384.02] I just don't understand what the differentiation well no I'm just I'm just I'm contrasting with you
[1384.02 → 1386.10] know songs about bitches and like
[1390.90 → 1397.62] but what if it is a what if it is a lesbian singing about bitches that well that's suddenly
[1397.62 → 1405.62] totally, totally chill i I think they're allowed to do that what I'm not taking a position here
[1406.42 → 1410.02] I think you are well is it on the bottom or top
[1414.02 → 1418.50] uh okay we should probably move on oh
[1418.50 → 1429.22] what next position um yeah I mean there's a lot more discussion topics on this one actually like
[1429.22 → 1437.46] there's uh there's where's the line between you know do you think strict online age verification is a
[1437.46 → 1443.46] long-term solution is the cost and privacy worth protecting our children I mean if I thought they
[1443.46 → 1450.18] could do it effectively and safely and maintain privacy and not have all this data leak no i
[1450.18 → 1456.50] don't think it would I I don't think I would mind it actually i I wouldn't mind age gating things um
[1457.70 → 1464.02] like to me, it's not really any different from them checking ID at the ticket counter of a movie
[1464.02 → 1470.66] yeah like i know but I don't trust them I know the seedier sides of the internet have been
[1470.66 → 1476.66] available to us since effectively the beginning of the internet um some of the oldest parts of the
[1476.66 → 1483.06] internet are very not safe for work I don't think they're that old oh
[1485.94 → 1491.38] those jokes we've got to stop I'm gonna wear out the button it's not a joke
[1491.38 → 1503.06] okay uh where was I going with this um right but before it
[1505.78 → 1511.14] like in my experience you had to be pretty deliberate about seeking it out, and now it's a lot
[1511.14 → 1520.18] easier now it's just there like you almost can't be on most parts of the internet anymore without
[1520.18 → 1533.22] it being shoved in your face um, um, and it's its it's pretty nuts so like yeah I don't know in general
[1535.38 → 1542.42] at least a like heavily filtered mode because you know the kids are going to get around it but if it
[1542.42 → 1547.78] wasn't just like passively there all the time that would probably be better and I mean our next question
[1547.78 → 1552.98] actually this has been very top of mind for me, I just like I said I just got back from China and um
[1554.42 → 1561.54] they have a very different approach to the tobacco industry than we do here in Canada so i was
[1561.54 → 1566.42] chatting with charade from the business team about it a fair bit because apparently a pretty popular
[1566.42 → 1572.74] thing to do when you go to China is to load up on your allowance of flavoured cigarettes and bring
[1572.74 → 1579.94] them back because they've been banned here for I don't think they lasted very long like I have no
[1579.94 → 1585.62] idea yeah flavoured cigarettes I think were a thing here for a little while but they basically
[1585.62 → 1592.26] went away because it was determined that they were much more appealing to kids sure I mean adults like
[1592.26 → 1596.58] flavoured things too, but it was more of the concern about you know thinking of the children right
[1596.58 → 1605.78] adult flavoured things and um they had liked all kinds of cigarette innovations like I'm a
[1605.78 → 1611.94] non-smoker so to me, it's like oh yeah interesting like I'm not going to smoke them but I'm like oh that's
[1612.90 → 1618.50] pretty clever if you wanted people to smoke more like there was one that they had that had so I learned
[1618.50 → 1624.82] how flavoured cigarettes work didn't know that before so they have a little gel in them okay like I assumed that
[1624.82 → 1630.82] the tobacco itself would be infused with sure some kind of I probably would have assumed the same
[1630.82 → 1635.46] flavour so that when you burn it is like something like a candle I don't know sure like the fuel
[1635.46 → 1640.42] of the fire would have been somehow soaked in it or something I don't know but no apparently that's not
[1640.42 → 1645.14] how it works you just have like normal tobacco, and then you have like a gel bead that you like squish
[1645.94 → 1651.30] and then as you're inhaling bringing it through the filter or whatever yeah then it sure so they had this
[1651.30 → 1658.66] one that seemed to have like multiple gel gels in it so that you could create different combinations of
[1658.66 → 1667.54] flavours and I'm just like freaking what like I mean cool idea I guess it like I said if you're trying
[1667.54 → 1677.38] to get people to smoke more um and they had like this uh like charade was collecting like cool
[1677.38 → 1683.70] packages, so there was this flying horse one that's from some meme like if smoking so bad why is the
[1683.70 → 1688.10] horse so happy or something like that I don't know there was some he was explaining it to me, he's
[1688.10 → 1695.70] he's very into the memes let's put it that way and um, and so he like got this pack of like blue
[1695.70 → 1700.34] flying horse are you looking it up I don't really want to share it on screen but I am trying to look it up
[1700.34 → 1705.86] yeah yeah the top left right there no it's fine we can just show the people they're adults
[1708.10 → 1715.38] if cigarette bad why horse happy checkmate liberals so he was so we went on a mission to find these
[1715.38 → 1721.22] cigarettes with the flying horse on them yeah um, and it made me sort of it really just
[1722.74 → 1729.22] made it impossible for me to not notice the contrast between their approach which is seems to be pretty
[1729.22 → 1737.06] much have at it versus here in Canada um charade was telling me that they're not even allowed to
[1737.06 → 1743.54] like brand them anymore like never mind getting rid of Joe camel like they're allowed to say what the
[1743.54 → 1748.50] brand is, but they're not allowed to have flying horses on them, they're not allowed to have pretty
[1748.50 → 1754.18] elegant looking ladies smoking on them, or you know anything like that yeah um and they have just like
[1754.18 → 1762.98] the know gross out nastiest pictures on them because um you know we have socialized health care
[1762.98 → 1771.86] so you know we literally all pay for people's vices collectively which incentivize the government very
[1771.86 → 1777.54] strongly to advise people that hey they probably shouldn't do things that are extremely harmful and
[1777.54 → 1783.22] extremely expensive to treat I've always been really fascinated how the smoke break became a thing at
[1783.22 → 1790.50] workplaces no comment maybe not a topic we want to dive into, but that has always been like genuinely
[1790.50 → 1798.02] fascinating to me that that became a thing yeah no it's its mandated so like our how our workplace
[1798.02 → 1804.74] employment code or whatever you have to have like there's certain like mandated break allowances and uh
[1805.30 → 1812.98] I think it's been revised since then, but my understanding was at some point the cigarette break
[1812.98 → 1818.34] was specifically for cigarettes and if you were a non-smoker you just didn't get it yeah uh but i
[1818.34 → 1824.98] believe when I worked at the bread factory that was the rule yeah i I believe everybody gets the
[1824.98 → 1830.58] 15-minute breaks or whatever they are now don't quote me on that I don't work in the hr department
[1830.58 → 1837.78] um so if anyone from leg is watching talk to hr before you start randomly taking uh smoking breaks in years the
[1837.78 → 1847.46] 15-minute breaks last time I heard uh were like approval basis um and yeah I know way back in the
[1847.46 → 1851.62] day it's very likely changed by now but when I used to work at the bread factory I remember complaining
[1851.62 → 1857.30] to management because I couldn't take 15-minute breaks because I didn't smoke and I was like this seems
[1858.18 → 1863.78] very backwards I don't even necessarily like care about taking the break I'm that's fine but like the
[1863.78 → 1871.78] fact that there is a benefit if you are a smoker is crazy to me um so anyway arc the question that
[1871.78 → 1877.22] sort of prompted me to talk about just noticing this difference was should vice like vapes cannabis
[1877.22 → 1884.58] alcohol gambling etc should they be allowed to advertise at all I mean I'll say this much I liked watching
[1884.58 → 1892.82] sports more before every flipping stupid ad was just and the commentators talking about it sometimes
[1892.82 → 1899.46] and stuff i I agree but at the same time more people watch sports now and are maybe more engaged
[1899.46 → 1907.38] so if you're the company if you're the NFL you might want or quite famously the NBA has talked about
[1907.38 → 1913.06] it extensively that the viewers are more engaged, and they spend more and so but then if you're going to
[1913.06 → 1917.38] make an ends justify the means argument shouldn't the ends be something other than more money
[1917.38 → 1926.10] like should there be a more positive like societally positive end if you're gonna ends justify the means
[1926.10 → 1932.74] me on this the company will never take that route um they're multi-billion dollar whatever
[1934.26 → 1938.58] MBA is all over the place company they're uh yeah, but our question is should they be allowed
[1938.58 → 1943.94] yeah so we're talking on a government stance yeah um yeah I don't know like it's weird because you get
[1943.94 → 1948.82] into like free speech stuff and whatnot sure yeah and just like freedom of you know being a being an
[1948.82 → 1954.58] adult with you know agency I mean I think that's that's something that you know I've thought about
[1954.58 → 1959.46] a lot ever since my sister's passing right like is at the end of the day I don't like the decision that
[1959.46 → 1965.14] she made but if somebody chooses to harm their body whether it's harming it just a little bit
[1965.14 → 1973.14] or whether it's harming it an awful lot like but then there's like what can you do where is the
[1973.14 → 1978.10] argument end right because like do you ban snowboarding yeah exactly that's a great point
[1978.74 → 1982.74] do you ban almost every sport it's a great it's a great point because
[1986.42 → 1994.26] I mean you can even you could even make and I'd say it's a pretty bad faith argument but there would be
[1994.26 → 2001.70] some logical basis to it like you could make an argument that sports done excessively can be
[2001.70 → 2008.74] extremely harmful that sports done excessively can cause a similar sort of chemical release in your
[2008.74 → 2014.34] body that makes you want to do more and more and more of it and that you can become obsessive I mean
[2014.34 → 2018.26] anything in unhealthy quantities there are some people like that is terrible for you people that
[2018.26 → 2025.46] get addicted to working out yeah that can show up in bad ways um 100 yeah yeah but what
[2025.46 → 2031.86] are you supposed to do Ben advertising doing sports should gyms not be able to advertise if we're talking
[2031.86 → 2040.26] about the weight on the medical system as well yeah like my family knew how to effectively sneak
[2040.26 → 2046.26] into the emergency wing of the local hospital because we were in there so often that it was just like
[2046.26 → 2049.70] annoying to have to talk to the people and be like yeah we know someone in here we should be able to
[2049.70 → 2059.14] visit them um because we did every single sport possibly imaginable so like little problems here and
[2059.14 → 2060.10] there were pretty normal
[2064.58 → 2070.34] just get one of those stamp card things yeah certain amount of visits oh another leg there bud
[2070.34 → 2078.90] yeah so I don't know but then you know the flip side of it is so again so you know where should be the
[2078.90 → 2087.22] line then should should should I have to flip on YouTube and see a commercial for fentanyl right
[2088.26 → 2096.82] for sent pills I've I have generally enjoyed that the I like that it's strange watching TV in the states
[2096.82 → 2103.70] because we don't have the amount of like lawyer and pharmaceutical ads that they have down there
[2103.70 → 2112.02] I like that we don't have those um I watch their TV and go wow I'm happy I don't have these ads not
[2112.02 → 2115.86] that I exactly watch TV up here either but um you know what I mean
[2115.86 → 2127.70] more house hippo less Xanax from Dan I agree yeah the house hippo was based Indian says I've never
[2127.70 → 2134.42] seen an ad for sent pills uh no I know it's a hypothetical exaggeration yeah no we're not well
[2134.42 → 2142.58] it's its it's just it's its demonstrating that at some point I like I think fundamentally when you
[2142.58 → 2148.66] really get into it even the most anti-regulation person eventually goes oh well we should probably
[2148.66 → 2154.74] regulate that something yeah yeah it's just that where you end up in a very difficult conversation
[2154.74 → 2159.78] sometimes where's the line is that everyone has the line at a different point like I think
[2159.78 → 2168.74] the vast majority of people should, would probably agree that you know uh that like methamphetamine
[2168.74 → 2174.26] probably shouldn't be just you know advertised during a sports ball game you know you shouldn't
[2174.26 → 2181.14] have athletes wearing like you know meth4u.com emblems on their helmets I'm able to keep playing
[2181.14 → 2189.38] through the pain because right like we could probably all agree that that's not good we probably shouldn't
[2189.38 → 2196.42] do that but then you know you end up over on the flip side where it's just I just thought of it
[2196.42 → 2204.18] totally yeah I don't even want to see it uh should I see it i who cares Germans like long hikes
[2204.18 → 2210.10] do you want to keep going on long hikes that's a reference uh
[2214.42 → 2217.30] do you want to be able to keep hiking through the night um
[2217.30 → 2222.58] okay so anyway um
[2226.74 → 2230.50] yeah uh wow so maybe what we could do is a new topic
[2231.54 → 2237.06] why don't we do that Luke you want to pick one uh Nintendo may have lost a key
[2237.06 → 2244.82] Pokémon
[2244.82 → 2245.46] uh
[2245.46 → 2248.66] Nintendo may have lost yeah it's not funny when you are the next Poland
[2249.54 → 2255.70] ah yes uh Nintendo may have lost a key Pokémon capture patent filing in Japan
[2256.66 → 2262.50] we have a bunch of different sources for this uh games for a creative block pc gamer games fray
[2262.50 → 2270.02] reported the JPO or the Japan patent office has issued an office action uh an initial decision
[2270.02 → 2276.50] against a Nintendo patent filing related to its action against pal world developer pocket pair
[2277.46 → 2283.78] that's funny of course their company name is even similar um following a third-party submission
[2283.78 → 2293.14] of prior art Nintendo's filing 2024-031879 is part of a chain of patents related to the capture mechanic
[2293.46 → 2301.14] uh the capture mechanic described as a player character throwing a ball at a character in virtual
[2301.14 → 2306.74] space capturing the character and setting it in the player character's possession okay so throwing a
[2306.74 → 2313.62] poke ball basically, basically yeah pc gamer described the subject of this particular patent as combining
[2313.62 → 2319.54] third-person aiming with two modes to throw items that either affect the target character like
[2319.54 → 2324.98] stunning it or capturing it or initiate combat against the target character by releasing a creature
[2324.98 → 2330.90] to battle it which happens in the newer Pokémon games so Pokémon battle yeah cool the rejected patent
[2330.90 → 2336.82] isn't directly related to the case but is both the child and parent of patents that are
[2336.82 → 2345.22] reference prior art games include ark monster hunter 4 pocket pairs trattoria and Pokémon Go
[2347.62 → 2355.70] okay uh the JPO said Nintendo's process lacked an inventive step onlookers have complained about the
[2355.70 → 2362.90] stagnant Pokémon series since this lawsuit began and just to be very clear for many many many years before
[2362.90 → 2370.10] I mean basically since trying to think the first one no n64 had that like coliseum battler
[2370.66 → 2374.90] yeah so that was my stadium yeah that was a little difference thank you, but that's, but that's not a
[2374.90 → 2379.46] mainline game i I'm just I'm just saying like you know neither would have um
[2381.86 → 2386.10] neither would have pal world like that wouldn't have necessarily been a mainline game so I'm just that's
[2386.10 → 2391.78] fair I'm just trying to say like they're that is for sure fair um you know they did the
[2391.78 → 2399.46] online version of the card game yeah I'm I'm trying to throw them I'm trying no I'm not yeah you're
[2399.46 → 2402.98] right I'm trying to throw them a bone that's because like the mainline games you always hear the
[2402.98 → 2407.54] same thing like every time I talk to someone about Pokémon games like Glenn for instance we were just on
[2407.54 → 2413.86] that trip to Japan together oh I was also in Japan um we were on that trip to Japan together, and he was
[2413.86 → 2417.54] playing whatever the latest Pokémon was and I was like oh yeah I haven't played one since blue and
[2417.54 → 2422.98] he's like sitting there playing a Pokémon game like yeah you haven't missed much um yep and that seems
[2422.98 → 2427.46] to be the consensus but I'm just I'm trying to throw a bone trying to throw a bone no so you're
[2427.46 → 2432.10] you're right i I don't know if the online version of the card game counts I don't know if it counts
[2432.10 → 2438.66] either but there are a lot of others Pokémon snap no there was the detective Pikachu uh movie that was
[2438.66 → 2445.38] something wasn't a game yeah it was good Ryan Reynolds you love to see it can move patents
[2445.38 → 2450.18] apply to no, no I don't mean from like a patenting standpoint I just mean like you know they haven't
[2450.18 → 2454.74] they haven't because it sounded like you were about to get into just like stagnant Pokémon series
[2454.74 → 2461.30] in general just how utterly stagnant it's been well it is yeah it for sure has been yeah Ryan Reynolds
[2461.30 → 2469.78] Canadian treasury uh he's been doing mean things for a bit has he hasn't he no I thought him and his
[2469.78 → 2476.18] wife were going after some dude and crazy legal fight and something something something am I thinking
[2476.18 → 2482.42] of the wrong guy I mean I know that Blake Lively has been involved in a lawsuit
[2482.42 → 2492.98] uh okay I don't know I don't care dude there's so many not okay not only is there just so many
[2492.98 → 2498.98] controversies every day that it's just exhausting to even consider keeping up with um, but that's one
[2498.98 → 2505.06] that's like not even in our realm that's movie stuff so like I don't know I've only heard of this
[2505.06 → 2512.34] one because someone that I know was talking about it and I even then it was a lot to care enough
[2512.34 → 2523.94] to pay attention yeah anyway um earlier this year Nintendo sought to modify another patent related
[2523.94 → 2530.90] to creature riding uh mid-litigation suggesting difficulty in proceedings games phrase said uh
[2531.46 → 2538.34] litigants whatever uh don't change a patent in the middle of an infringement case unless
[2538.34 → 2544.50] they feel the patent is at a fairly high risk of being deemed invalid in its original form which
[2546.34 → 2551.38] does kind of make sense discussion question is if Nintendo ultimately loses this lawsuit
[2551.38 → 2558.02] how does that bode for its litigious attitude will it encourage more fighting back a significant
[2558.02 → 2566.58] amount maybe oh my I don't think Nintendo will start backing down it might be that if they lose this
[2566.58 → 2572.66] other companies see them as less scary therefore we'll fight more but I don't I don't feel like
[2572.66 → 2577.46] this will slow Nintendo down at all if anything they're just going to try to be more buttoned up
[2577.46 → 2585.30] about things so that they are less counterable that's all I would expect would happen in summary
[2585.30 → 2594.74] Blake Lively accuses director Justin Baldwin of toxicity on set Justin Baldwin counter accuses Blake
[2594.74 → 2602.98] lively of being toxic on set cool Ryan Reynolds is in Blake Lively's corner because she is his wife
[2603.78 → 2610.58] and uh they have both taken reputational hits over this whole drama you're welcome
[2612.10 → 2619.46] that is celeb linked my life is worse for having known that is it really yes worse not very measurably
[2619.46 → 2626.42] okay, but it is I was going to say i I will okay no i have to push back on that because by the time we
[2626.42 → 2632.90] talk again next week on wan show you will not know it anymore, but there's some other potentially better
[2632.90 → 2637.78] information that could have been put in my head that I would have also forgot by next week
[2637.78 → 2642.66] dude people ask me like hours after wan show about something I said on wan show and I'll be like did I
[2642.66 → 2653.46] okay I don't I don't know yeah yeah oh man I was so ready I'm so ready for this one he sensed it
[2654.10 → 2659.78] all right what else I sensed is that it's time for us to talk about merch messages if you're not familiar
[2660.66 → 2669.38] you must be new here welcome merch messages are our way of having you guys interact with the show
[2669.38 → 2676.18] rather than having you donate to people who frankly probably statistically speaking don't need it as
[2676.18 → 2682.82] much as you do or just throw money at your screen in hopes that something good might happen uh if you
[2682.82 → 2688.42] want to interact with the show hey why don't you send a merch message all you have to do is uh go to
[2688.42 → 2696.18] lttstore.com and add something to your cart once you add it to your cart you will be prompted to leave
[2696.18 → 2706.98] a merch message uh it will go to producer Dan uh producer anon excuse me don't dox me um who will
[2706.98 → 2713.38] redirect it to wherever it needs to go or will reply to it himself, or we'll just throw it up on screen
[2713.38 → 2720.82] with a little hi mom or whatever, or he might if you are really lucky curate it and Luke and I will
[2720.82 → 2727.62] respond to your merch message um that box is only there when we're live by the way uh before you
[2727.62 → 2732.82] guys go and send a merch message for today why don't we have a look at some of the things that are on the
[2732.82 → 2740.26] store that's right keeping with our Halloween spooky theme we are bringing some of our most iconic shirt
[2740.26 → 2750.34] designs back from the dead do you need to do like a full refresh or something do you oh leg.GG

[2759.78 → 2764.90] selling t-shirts from the last few years reimagined in both uh oh
[2767.22 → 2775.06] oh arty to update this text to let us know when it's good to go see the giant text in fairness to me
[2775.86 → 2782.74] it wasn't that red or yellow, and it wasn't that prominently placed it wasn't that red or yellow
[2782.74 → 2788.50] what do you mean I am being exactly that I'm being verbally ironic oh I see to be fair it is
[2788.50 → 2794.50] technically an advertisement, and you didn't see it yeah that is fair yeah it's fair I'll give them that
[2794.50 → 2801.62] okay we are going to have to do this later um ignore that we can still do the merch message
[2801.62 → 2809.86] sure let's do a couple merch messages Dan hit me I got one for you here hey LLD as an aviation system
[2809.86 → 2816.42] technician in the Canadian armed forces and a helicopter pilot new you're wrong about jet fuel
[2816.42 → 2821.86] am I right am I right yeah yeah you're right you're right new autonomous helicopters kind
[2821.86 → 2828.82] of make me worry about the future of the industry would you ever ride in an AI helicopter and has new
[2828.82 → 2838.98] tech ever ruined a passion yes yeah all of them everyone I think a lot of ice block enthusiasts
[2838.98 → 2845.30] probably were pretty peeved about the invention of the refrigerator yeah yeah people who like
[2845.30 → 2851.06] we used to have to work for our cold fruit, but he said a passion do you think there was ice block
[2852.02 → 2858.26] no yeah well you know what some people get pretty passionate maybe it could be their business some
[2858.26 → 2863.38] guy that just feels like he really had a good technique yeah perfect at cutting them out like this was
[2863.38 → 2868.34] his thing okay I think a better example might be horses in the automobile then because people were
[2868.34 → 2875.06] very passionate about their horses which I totally get horses tech shops are incredible oh dude yeah
[2875.06 → 2880.34] that's seen that's that's a career and a passion a lot of people get into running a mom and pop tech shop
[2880.34 → 2890.26] because they know want to fix people's computers I had when I was like 14 that seemed like a very
[2890.26 → 2896.58] possible vision for my future uh yep not so much yeah no pretty pretty pretty tough
[2896.58 → 2904.18] business yeah um what was uh what was I going to say I was going to say something what topic were we on
[2904.18 → 2908.58] again oh yeah that's right it was a merch message I was gonna I was going to get somewhere with this
[2908.58 → 2912.50] hold on where'd it go uh yeah would you ever ride an AI helicopter
[2912.50 → 2923.62] it seems to me that in terms of like handling the inputs and outputs so by inputs I would mean
[2924.74 → 2930.50] things like uh you know wind direction and things like readings off of an altimeter
[2931.06 → 2939.46] um i i I don't even I don't even know if you need AI to make a helicopter somewhat autonomous
[2939.46 → 2946.18] necessarily like you could do it algorithmically without necessarily AI I mean a lot of the AI in
[2946.18 → 2953.30] an autonomous car for instance is more about the recognition of the route and obstacles um I mean
[2953.30 → 2960.42] you'd certainly need AI for any kind of like vision component of it so for like landing or obstacle
[2960.42 → 2967.30] avoidance or whatever else I would I ride in an AI helicopter good lord
[2967.30 → 2975.22] yeah knowing how sketchy helicopters are in the first place yeah like have you been in one I forget
[2975.22 → 2980.18] yeah, yeah like a few times were you sketched no really I was a little sketched
[2981.62 → 2986.90] like the pilot was great and totally I trusted the pilot is my brother-in-law so certainly
[2986.90 → 2994.18] no interest in seeing me plummet to the ground with him in the helicopter um unless what I don't
[2994.18 → 3004.42] know yeah now should be fine all right yeah yeah um stop ale cum so that was fine I understand the
[3004.42 → 3011.14] whole the Jesus not thing yeah and the whole thing it just felt like it felt like crap you know like it
[3011.14 → 3017.70] felt really cheap yeah it's like yeah this is like a know multi however many thousands and thousands
[3017.70 → 3024.34] of dollars machine, and it feels cheaper than like my parents geometry when I was a kid like it
[3025.30 → 3033.62] like it's a light box strapped to yeah insane death spiny things yeah right like yeah, but that's kind of sick
[3033.62 → 3040.82] carrying around a bunch of fuel you know yeah pretty terrifying i um, but you know if you're talking like
[3040.82 → 3046.66] worrying about the future of the industry from like uh like a piloting stance like are we gonna are we going to lose the skill
[3046.66 → 3055.06] skill to pilot aircraft because we're just going to like rely on them just operating autonomously
[3055.06 → 3059.38] I mean yeah that's happened for lots of things yeah i no i yeah I think that's uh I think that's a
[3059.38 → 3065.62] very real concern i I don't see them going away forever just like people still ride horses and are still
[3065.62 → 3072.66] very enthusiastic about riding horses I think people will still fly aircraft um but will it be a
[3072.66 → 3080.02] disruptor in the industry yeah i I wouldn't doubt it yeah um this does seem like a perfect segue into
[3080.02 → 3089.94] something that we uh we're not right about last week so we got some clarifications on uh jet a fuel
[3089.94 → 3096.98] apparently I mean we kind of talked about this last week it's very similar to uh kerosene and um
[3096.98 → 3102.58] um what else is it similar to I think the biggest thing that I read that we didn't figure
[3102.58 → 3109.30] out before the end of the show is that the gas turbines were like a thing actually a super a
[3109.30 → 3115.46] thing and like pretty efficient yeah, so this was posted by uh low boom from the ECC squad I think
[3115.46 → 3119.78] um, but it's not as crazy as it seems on the face they're doing a lot more than just strapping a jet
[3119.78 → 3126.42] engine to a stand yeah this is the turbojet core of the turbofan engine, so there's no fan, and they're
[3126.42 → 3133.54] not running it on jet a so you can actually modify it to run on natural gas and hydrogen so no not as
[3133.54 → 3139.54] efficient as a purpose designed natural gas turbine like a power station would use but still quite
[3139.54 → 3146.02] efficient yeah quite efficient quite cheap to operate um and apparently there's a lot of these
[3146.02 → 3152.82] things just like kicking around because they've been retired from aviation use uh, so this was
[3152.82 → 3158.18] something that Nana exists ads they've been retired from aviation use uh so I don't know you
[3158.18 → 3163.94] might as well do something with them gives them a productive use yep so it does still it does still
[3163.94 → 3173.14] seem a little ridiculous to me where we get the majority of our energy from falling water um to be just like
[3176.02 → 3183.78] you know spitting spinning it did you hear about the uh the bc hydro ban on crypto yeah I did crazy
[3185.30 → 3191.14] to be clear it was only making permanent what was already a moratorium from a couple of years ago
[3191.70 → 3198.10] but I didn't actually know that yeah crypto mining is uh is effectively banned at least I think new
[3198.10 → 3205.06] startup operations are banned in the province now in order to conserve our energy capacity so it's not
[3205.06 → 3210.10] closing down current business I don't think so don't quote me on that though I would also be
[3210.10 → 3217.30] very surprised if any current business were able to expand significantly, and it doesn't stop any
[3217.30 → 3221.86] crypto mining in the province I don't think it does anything about that one where they bought their own
[3221.86 → 3227.94] hydro dam or whatever it was so it would only be sense it's just yeah you can't get it from bc hydro
[3227.94 → 3235.94] directly if you're on the grid so cool I mean honestly it seems like something that more places
[3237.22 → 3242.10] might have done earlier than they did like china banned it ages ago if I recall correctly
[3242.98 → 3248.50] I don't know I could see like because uh basically everywhere at least a little bit of power is
[3248.50 → 3253.94] subsidized it would be kind of interesting to do like okay maybe you don't have to buy your own dam
[3253.94 → 3261.94] or your own power plant of whatever sort, but you could get flagged as like non-subsidized power
[3262.74 → 3267.94] uh birdie num says seems like a cop-out for not increasing infrastructure this is why I'm saying
[3267.94 → 3274.18] what I'm saying because if you get non-subsidized power then you're just contributing to potentially
[3274.18 → 3279.94] building more infrastructure potentially, potentially so that seems fine to me, but that's a little bit
[3279.94 → 3286.18] difficult to police maybe and also I mean part of the rationale was that they want the power going
[3286.18 → 3293.30] to um they want the power going to projects that generate economic prosperity for the province of
[3293.30 → 3299.62] British Columbia and doom-scrolling so at real mining was one of the ones that they specifically brought
[3299.62 → 3306.90] up not crypto mining um so it's not that we don't have power it's that we don't want to use it for
[3306.90 → 3312.98] mining bitcoins that realistically all the economic value of which are going to go out
[3313.62 → 3321.46] uh rather than contributing to new projects and building our economy so I get it i i I get it
[3321.46 → 3328.58] actually I'm i i I don't really see a problem with it personally uh what else do we want to talk
[3328.58 → 3335.54] about we got man we got a lot this week we do have a lot this week uh we're on two more topics
[3335.54 → 3340.66] should we do another one of the big main ones yeah do you want to talk about AI powered astroturf
[3340.66 → 3348.58] oh yeah that one sure let's do it all right double speed AI a startup bulk content creation service
[3349.22 → 3355.30] uh by the way headache warning by the time I'm finished talking you will have at least the beginnings of a
[3355.30 → 3363.22] migraine so stay tuned double speed AI a startup bulk content creation service has received a million
[3363.22 → 3372.10] dollar investment from a16z aka Andreessen Horowitz the venture capital firm founded by mark Anderson and Ben
[3372.10 → 3381.94] Horowitz in 2009 the startup operates a phone farm that lets its customers orchestrate actions on
[3381.94 → 3390.02] thousands of social accounts through both bulk content creation and deployment through instrumented human action
[3390.02 → 3398.02] that seems to be a wordy way of saying that the company's phone bots mimic human interactions on
[3398.02 → 3404.58] physical devices in order to trick the increasingly AI powered content moderation that is employed by
[3404.58 → 3411.78] social platforms which seems like a wordy way to say that they use actual phones rather than virtualized
[3411.78 → 3419.70] hardware connected to cellular networks rather than connected to a data centre, and then they use
[3419.70 → 3426.18] you know a robot finger essentially to operate the phone in such a way that it is indistinguishable
[3426.18 → 3432.90] from a human operating the phone to get past any kind of uh spam prevention that would be put in place
[3432.90 → 3441.22] by the platforms which is a wordy way of saying they buy phone robot arm touch seem like human might not
[3441.22 → 3446.82] even really be armed it might yeah it might not the point a pokey thing that goes yeah the point is just that
[3446.82 → 3455.06] by by by operating the device kind of like um kind of like aim bots or cheating mechanisms that rather
[3455.06 → 3463.06] than being software are hardware so where you actually you know have your mouse on a XY you know robot of
[3463.06 → 3469.70] some sort that moves it that would be impossible for any kind of anti-cheat to detect if you had like a
[3469.70 → 3475.30] separate computer monitoring the video feed and using machine vision to look for opponents for instance
[3475.30 → 3484.50] um so this is basically the phone bot farm spam content version of that kind of aim bot if that makes
[3484.50 → 3496.34] sense clients will pay between 1500 and 7500 dollars a month to use the phone farm which can even dm
[3496.34 → 3503.22] users based on their public comments saying things like one quick sec do you know that it's robot no oh
[3504.10 → 3511.14] it probably isn't you oh why do you say all that oh because basically the idea is that by using a
[3511.14 → 3516.42] physical device and some means of inputting as closely as how a human would do it as possible
[3516.42 → 3521.22] it will be impossible to track oh yeah but i don't I don't I suspect sorry i should have clarified this
[3521.22 → 3526.82] in the longer term they may go that far as to physically interact with the screens for now they
[3526.82 → 3532.58] probably don't have to especially if they're using android so this was shared in flow point chat and is
[3532.58 → 3538.90] my understanding of how these places usually tend to look there you go uh just a bunch of phones
[3538.90 → 3545.70] some that don't even have screens pretty wild, and it is what it is yep just tons and tons and tons and
[3545.70 → 3554.10] tons of phones for days that's where your fake internet comes from yep dead internet theory baby
[3554.10 → 3561.62] yeah sorry i should have I should have clarified that it's not necessary today but what i suspect
[3561.62 → 3567.06] is that over time their spam prevention will get more sophisticated, and they will start to
[3567.06 → 3572.82] they'll start to implement you know patterns of tracking your behaviour where if all of your inputs
[3572.82 → 3577.94] are you know too precise or if you don't or if they're not inconsistent enough they might be able to
[3577.94 → 3583.94] detect the patterns in this kind of software managed screenless device i don't know that there might be
[3583.94 → 3590.18] other ways to detect it um are you a robot boxes have been effectively fake for a very long time
[3590.18 → 3594.42] like 10 years now yeah like they don't have those don't matter at all but there there might be
[3594.42 → 3600.18] other ways like rooted into the operating system or something i don't know but in those cases you can
[3600.18 → 3607.30] almost certainly just get around it pretty easily to be honest i don't know so yeah clients pay between
[3607.30 → 3614.18] 1500 and 7500 a month to use the phone farm which can even dm users based on their public comments
[3614.18 → 3619.86] saying things like sorry to hear you're experiencing x you should try y
[3622.26 → 3631.22] apparently it works double speed co-founder Zohar lakh ani okay claimed on Twitter that out of 130 dms that
[3631.22 → 3637.38] were sent in one campaign 15 pointed to a conversion of course he is a double speed co-founder so he would
[3637.38 → 3644.34] say that it's really, really great yeah he went on to post a vision for the future of social agents asking
[3645.22 → 3650.26] why doesn't Simba from the Lion King have an Instagram account where he posts engages in comments and gets
[3650.26 → 3657.06] added to group chats the code because that's because it's all fake Simba's going to convince someone to
[3657.06 → 3662.42] unalike themselves that's why the code running the service is also at least partially AI generated with
[3662.42 → 3670.10] lakh ani writing cloud code is truly our third co-founder it's worth noting that pretty much all of
[3670.10 → 3676.50] this is already against the terms of service on multiple top social media platforms meta for instance
[3676.50 → 3682.58] prohibits posting sharing or engaging content at high frequencies and specifically disallows selling
[3682.58 → 3687.70] buying or exchanging for engagements such as likes shares views follows clicks use of specific
[3687.70 → 3693.30] hashtags etc it's been increasingly unclear though if any of these platforms are actually interested in
[3693.30 → 3710.10] enforcing any of these policies so yeah um thoughts cool it is feels like in a lot of ways to me
[3710.10 → 3718.02] that some of these efforts i have this is probably tinfoil hat just to be very clear I'm prepping
[3718.02 → 3723.14] everyone this is probably tinfoil hat, but it feels like to me some of these efforts are pointed in order
[3723.14 → 3733.78] to make the free and open internet bad oh wow we are getting into tinfoil I'm telling you i am fully
[3733.78 → 3740.66] accepting that this is tinfoil hat stuff but there's just been so much stuff lately that is directly
[3740.66 → 3747.54] targeted at severely worsening the experience of free and open platform you are assuming that our lizard
[3747.54 → 3755.78] overlords have the self-awareness to know that they are making it bad i think you're giving them an awful
[3755.78 → 3764.10] lot of credit that has not been earned maybe do you think do you think Elon Musk for instance thinks
[3764.10 → 3771.30] that he has made twitter worse or better i do wonder i mean there's no way he wouldn't say better but i
[3771.30 → 3777.54] but i do wonder because there's like undoubtedly more bots on it now than there was before do you
[3777.54 → 3783.78] think that he thinks Wikipedia is better than Wikipedia or worse he might think it's better he
[3783.78 → 3789.14] might actually think that's better do you think that Zuckerberg thinks that Facebook is better
[3790.42 → 3795.62] Zuckerberg probably does not think Facebook is better but is very happy about looting everyone
[3796.18 → 3800.82] okay very heavily i feel like Zuck is a little bit more aware
[3800.82 → 3808.18] better does that make it better or worse maybe worse but i don't know I'm not sure see billy Eilish
[3808.18 → 3814.50] called him out no oh it was cool okay yeah she like donated a bunch of money and was like yeah
[3814.50 → 3818.18] billionaires suck basically and if you're a billionaire you should be asking yourself why am
[3818.18 → 3824.18] i am billionaire, and he was in the audience oh yeah it was pretty cool she waits she donated a bunch
[3824.18 → 3829.94] of money to what i don't remember okay doesn't matter point is Zuckerberg didn't clap oh yeah
[3831.14 → 3839.22] nice cool yeah sure pawn crackers it might have been a publicity stunt i don't even i don't even care
[3839.22 → 3846.26] because like at the end of the day it's not about who won w publicity it's about who lost yeah yeah
[3846.90 → 3852.90] sometimes that's maybe okay yeah i don't even look i don't even listen to her music i don't mind it if
[3852.90 → 3858.50] it's on it's like background music for me like I'm not super into billy Eilish or anything um but like
[3858.50 → 3866.02] it is yeah i can still think someone's pretty cool for pulling a move like that come
[3866.02 → 3868.82] on that's a power move that's like uh
[3868.82 → 3878.82] oh man who was it that uh that hosted was it the Oscars, and they basically like
[3878.82 → 3884.18] roasted everyone like roasted Leonardo for being there with someone 20 years younger than him like
[3884.18 → 3888.58] roasted all these guys years ago wasn't it yeah who was that someone yeah Ricky Gervais
[3888.58 → 3895.54] he's so good that was pretty funny yeah it's awesome um
[3897.22 → 3900.02] what are we uh what are we supposed to be doing right now another topic
[3900.90 → 3904.58] sure let's do it you want to do house robots sure let's do house robots
[3904.58 → 3911.46] neo a home of course it's called neo because it's the one yeah from one x meant to do boring and
[3911.46 → 3918.26] mundane tasks around the house for you is almost here I'm going to bring up the product page cool wow
[3918.26 → 3923.94] grandpa loves them why are they hugging that's weird well only one of them is hugging neo can't hug yet
[3923.94 → 3929.62] oh boy give him time give it a list of chores to complete each day like emptying the dishwasher or
[3929.62 → 3937.06] vacuuming the rugs it's twenty thousand dollars and requires a two hundred dollar deposit this gets
[3937.06 → 3943.78] ownership are they three-year warranty war they couldn't have them play a real card game
[3945.22 → 3946.34] they're playing war
[3949.62 → 3949.94] why
[3952.66 → 3957.78] instead of cleaning your house you can do you can play a game the worst card game with the out
[3957.78 → 3967.62] kid with an outcome that is predetermined oh that's painful oh my god alternatively it's a 500
[3967.62 → 3973.62] a month subscription service option which only comes with the starter productivity package wait
[3973.62 → 3978.10] you don't have to pay the subscription if you buy it i thought it was both i think it's one or the other
[3978.10 → 3984.50] interesting it is apparently lightweight no idea what that means it is apparently quiet soft and gentle no
[3984.50 → 3990.18] idea what any of those mean it comes in black white or blue colours, and it launches in 2026 the wall
[3990.18 → 3996.18] street journal tried it early everything took a long time loading three items into a dishwasher took
[3996.18 → 4004.34] five minutes grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge 10 feet away took 10 inches away no 10 feet
[4004.34 → 4012.58] away it took 60 that's not that bad took 67 seconds everything was done through teleoperation because
[4012.58 → 4019.38] the 2026 launch comes with caveats the AI isn't done learning and under the growth with you section
[4019.38 → 4025.46] it states that this is early access initial buyers are essentially beta testers which is true for
[4025.46 → 4033.54] almost everything any task it can't do on its own someone will teleoperate for you there is no way
[4035.14 → 4040.18] amazing this has to be scheduled the person connects to the device and uses the eye cameras to see
[4040.18 → 4044.26] these teleoperation tasks are used to train the robots further
[4046.90 → 4050.74] and then in quotes it says if we don't have your data we can't make the product better
[4053.86 → 4060.26] that's not true but anyway uh these are not only humanoid these are not the only humanoid robots
[4060.26 → 4068.18] coming during IFA 2025 aura highlighted the for anyone and MEPA robots these focus on tasks that are
[4068.18 → 4073.14] dirty dull or dangerous, and they think that they still need a couple more years to go mainstream
[4073.14 → 4078.10] is this the one that was held up by cables hold on it sure was hold on I'm not the I'm not done with
[4078.10 → 4084.26] neo yet so basically they're just saying up front what everyone else has had to admit after the fact
[4085.38 → 4093.22] oh yeah it's uh it's the whatever Turk remember when the Amazon Turk from Amazon yeah yeah it's just that
[4093.22 → 4099.86] it's almost certainly just that I'm not even kidding like API wasn't Amazon uh Amazon's go store it
[4099.86 → 4109.78] turns out actually just Mechanical Turk yeah yeah what happened to builder dot yeah AI equals oh man this is
[4109.78 → 4118.82] brutal we've had we've had azure go down had AWS go down what would it mean if Mechanical Turk went down
[4118.82 → 4125.86] yeah Amazon's AI store seemed too magical, and they were the thousand contractors in India working on the
[4125.86 → 4133.06] companies just walk out technology offer a stark reminder that AI isn't always what it seems it might just be cheap labour
[4133.70 → 4142.02] and this was not that long ago this was when AI had made a lot of the progress that it's made over the last couple of years
[4142.02 → 4154.58] um at 500 what was it 500 a month yep 500 a month could they did everything that it said it would be
[4154.58 → 4161.14] cheaper than some services that offer the same okay I'm guessing because if you tried to get like a maid
[4161.86 → 4170.98] so is this the solution to kicking out all the illegal immigrants maybe because if you tried to get a maid
[4170.98 → 4177.78] that cleaned up your stuff every day uh-huh there's no way it costs less than or equal to 500 bucks a
[4177.78 → 4183.86] month but if it took them less than a minute to go get a cup of water maybe they could only be there a
[4183.86 → 4188.58] couple days a week instead of there every day no but if it's is it's a constant cleanliness thing which
[4188.58 → 4195.22] this robot could theoretically offer uh-huh then they'd have to be there every day I see if you want to be
[4195.22 → 4200.74] able to eat your food and drink your drinks anywhere in the house and have it not be dirty the next day
[4200.74 → 4204.82] every day they have to be there every day there's no way this thing can wash dishes
[4204.82 → 4212.90] though I guess it could put it in the dishwasher yeah but like oh man can you imagine having to be
[4212.90 → 4219.22] the teleoperate for this thing trying to like you saw the hands right what if it drops the fork
[4219.22 → 4226.66] do you think it can pick the fork back up there goes two minutes or however long yeah, or it can't one
[4226.66 → 4234.18] of the two I'd be dude I'd be operating this and I'd be like I'd be like this oh I bleeped it so they
[4234.18 → 4242.90] couldn't tell I said fork that was rough um so forget it anyway uh imagine needing to hire a maid to
[4242.90 → 4248.74] clean up after your cleaning robot
[4249.94 → 4256.66] fantastic I mean should we should oh man discussion question is are we getting one
[4257.54 → 4264.18] i I mean dude it's an it's a kickstarter right now right like it's uh I don't know, or it's like it's
[4264.18 → 4272.74] it's basically yeah it's an it's a pre-order in it in it fully refundable U.S. deliveries start
[4272.74 → 4281.62] at 2026 there's no way there's no way that any reasonable anything is going to be delivered
[4283.06 → 4283.30] soon
[4285.62 → 4286.74] it looks so weird
[4289.46 → 4290.90] like unsettling
[4296.26 → 4301.06] I think it's supposed to think so I think this whole thing's an attention grab
[4302.74 → 4309.30] I like the blue one it's not even trying to be a human colour you know
[4311.54 → 4311.86] okay
[4313.46 → 4316.58] well what I like my robots to look like the tin man from The Wizard of Oz
[4317.54 → 4322.18] nice got kind of a tin man vibe to him didn't he sure
[4322.18 → 4328.18] what do you think the battery life's like
[4331.94 → 4336.66] yeah, but then it could just go dock itself if a humanoid robot docks itself is that weird
[4337.38 → 4342.90] hold on I want to check something their website keeps screwing up and uh thanks Dave nice
[4342.90 → 4356.50] is this footage sped up probably hold on I can tell no maybe not oh well
[4356.50 → 4362.26] well it's probably just pre-scripted yeah I'm just trying to uh I'm trying to I'm trying to watch him
[4362.26 → 4368.58] and see if it's sped up what's he doing get the door except well why did he know that she was at the
[4368.58 → 4373.22] door well before she was at the door prescripted okay so hold on so it's walking
[4380.66 → 4385.06] here's my problem with that clip there's no way that somebody that lazy is in that good shape
[4390.34 → 4393.06] I don't know man like i my suspension of disbelief
[4394.66 → 4396.26] ah
[4398.58 → 4400.90] I don't like it
[4404.26 → 4405.46] kind of has a front butt hey
[4408.34 → 4410.90] they could have given it like a kangaroo pouch to hold stuff
[4415.78 → 4425.86] cool uh okay hold on hold on if it was good if it actually did what they're selling here
[4425.86 → 4431.54] like if it could vacuum your house for you and put away dishes like literally put them in the dishwasher
[4431.54 → 4444.34] and put them away in your cabinets for 20 grand no subscription would you consider buying it
[4444.34 → 4452.26] and I'm going to throw this at you right away before you even start thinking not necessarily for yourself
[4452.26 → 4463.38] yeah see I got him I got him he had his walls up he had his armour locked in he was ready to fight back
[4463.38 → 4468.58] on this even me having the audacity to suggest that he would buy anything at all and then I was like
[4468.58 → 4475.70] like but what if your parents were aging which they are just like mine we're getting to that age now
[4476.66 → 4479.78] well I don't want to talk about that yet all aging so
[4479.78 → 4489.06] would you consider if it could actually do that 20 grand would you consider that if it actually did
[4489.06 → 4495.38] all of this if it could meaningfully improve the lives of people who are legitimately now mobility
[4495.38 → 4499.46] challenged I want to see things like failure rate I know it says it comes with a three-year warranty but
[4499.46 → 4506.90] still I'd want to see things like failure rate um I'd want to see safety stuff how heavy is it if it
[4506.90 → 4512.58] trips over something it's a great question bashes into somebody that's a great question how bad is that
[4512.58 → 4518.66] um I'd want to figure out things like that not from the company I'd want to see that from people's
[4518.66 → 4525.30] usage of it but I could see there being a state not right now but I could see there being a state
[4525.94 → 4533.22] where that does potentially make sense especially if it had some ability to do forms of care yeah i
[4533.22 → 4536.98] mean pathos says that's a roundabout way of telling your parents you don't love them, and it's like well
[4536.98 → 4542.58] no you can't be there 100 of the time because you're an adult, and you have a life like i I have children
[4542.58 → 4547.78] there's also I can't be taking care of the generation before me and the generation under me at the same
[4547.78 → 4552.26] time it just doesn't really what happens when you're at work yeah I can't, I can't be there all the time
[4552.26 → 4555.38] um there's also effectively
[4559.54 → 4565.38] ban uh there's also effectively that's a terrible argument oh you don't love your parents well
[4565.38 → 4571.38] here's twenty thousand dollars of robot oh okay I see what you're saying okay yeah yeah yeah good point
[4571.38 → 4575.46] um I read that totally the wrong way I probably did not explain yeah um
[4575.46 → 4581.94] um yeah i so you know you're at work you're doing whatever else you're having your own life
[4581.94 → 4587.30] um if this could significantly improve their lives in a variety of ways then that's that's something to
[4587.30 → 4596.42] consider there's also damn near infinite stories of elderly people not being exactly treated great at
[4597.14 → 4603.54] homes or whatever other situations they're in I know like my grandpa had a perfect experience where
[4603.54 → 4610.34] he ended up but terrible experiences at a few places leading there um
[4614.90 → 4622.10] yeah that's definitely a possibility if it was good if it all those other things were solved it's
[4622.10 → 4628.26] definitely a possibility not for myself not right now but I could also see potentially for myself when i
[4628.26 → 4634.66] if I'm having you know and by the time you have mobility issues this might be an option pretty
[4634.66 → 4642.10] solid yeah yeah I mean I'm gonna I'm willing to say probably I think on that one yeah okay I mean me too
[4642.10 → 4652.74] if it could do all of that yeah like 50 years you're not going to need it for yeah I think 40 years less than 50
[4652.74 → 4657.54] brother uh maybe less than 40 depending on how things go I mean that's true my wrist is still a
[4657.54 → 4663.62] huge problem actually try to do push-ups yesterday and not again I mean still yeah i I thought it was
[4663.62 → 4667.22] fine because I haven't had problems with it try to do push-ups yesterday and just the compressive
[4667.22 → 4671.54] force I thought it was fine the second I got up and I got my hand out of that position I was like
[4671.54 → 4678.90] that was a bad idea that was a bad idea do knuckle push-ups no it's still compressive oh I thought it was
[4678.90 → 4683.54] this angle that was the problem oh really the whole thing huh it's just it's it's the tendons all
[4683.54 → 4691.54] the way around yeah it's getting better, but it's just so a tendon repair is slow it just is
[4691.54 → 4698.02] trust me I know slower than muscle a lot slower yeah it's so slow it's been a year dude yeah i really
[4698.02 → 4702.42] hope mine doesn't take a year because not being able to do basically any pushing exercises for a year
[4702.42 → 4715.94] would be terrible yeah um but I could do stuff by like five months but if it is still I can feel it
[4715.94 → 4723.54] now, and it's been a year um, and it was still painful as little as like there are things to me right now
[4723.54 → 4728.18] like if I do recently I'm going to look suggestive but if I do is I rock back and forth like this with
[4728.18 → 4735.62] my left wrist I mean depends how it's shaped how suggestive that is yeah anyway uh if I rock back
[4735.62 → 4740.34] and forth like this right yeah I'll do that yeah I rock back and forth like this left wrist is totally
[4740.34 → 4749.70] fine if I do this it's like there oh I heard it yeah yeah yeah every time by the way, and it like cracks
[4749.70 → 4756.18] and grinds the whole way like it's the people are asking how it happened we talked about it last week
[4756.18 → 4763.54] but it was repetitive strain with a lot of force behind its injury for many hours yeah working
[4763.54 → 4773.38] on his place his house um yeah okay it is what it is uh but yeah I mean these types of things are
[4773.38 → 4780.50] interesting um I think this company is trying to be unsettling with their advertisements
[4780.50 → 4788.98] um like this I think is supposed to make you feel weird I doubt it again I think you're
[4790.50 → 4794.90] I think you're assuming a level of self-awareness that i just don't think is there Luke
[4796.50 → 4801.06] maybe yeah it's also weird to me that a use case for it is vacuuming the floor
[4801.86 → 4806.82] yeah it's like if you're going to spend 20 grand on a robot you can probably buy a robot vacuum
[4806.82 → 4810.98] for every room yeah like that's like the least interesting thing that it could possibly do
[4810.98 → 4820.58] putting the room in Roomba just yeah yeah have an army of them yeah um we should probably do sponsors
[4822.02 → 4826.50] the show is brought to you today by sale when you're out roaming the world it's important to

[4947.22 → 4952.42] slash wan show the show is also brought to you by Miró one of the growing pains when starting and
[4952.42 → 4962.18] growing a business is getting all the moving parts aligned who is doing these days that is so weird
[4962.18 → 4969.54] and uncanny what this yeah ew why is that weird and uncanny look at it look at the way the head
[4969.54 → 4975.30] moves it's like it's just a still picture that rotates yes I know what it is Luke that's not that
[4975.30 → 4981.06] weird um it looks weird that's like 10-year-old internet stuff yeah, and it's weird and uncanny I think
[4981.06 → 4988.74] you're just offset from the previous one this is pretty normal uh paw cheats says ew there you go
[4988.74 → 4996.34] got them it's so lifelike but Miró can help get a team on the same page both metaphorically and
[4996.34 → 5001.06] literally they're an online collaborative whiteboard that's great for brainstorming storyboarding or
[5001.06 → 5006.10] keeping track of different projects their built-in AI tool lets you use a simple prompt to generate
[5006.10 → 5012.42] in-depth text or transform images saving you and your team time but Miró knows a team can't rely on AI
[5012.42 → 5018.26] alone and that it shouldn't replace good old-fashioned human imagination it's there to lend
[5018.26 → 5022.42] a helping hand with things like organization validating data or product marketing and while
[5022.42 → 5028.10] we can't show it on screen our company org chart was made on Miró, so anyone can go in and see the
[5028.10 → 5034.58] workflow and direct reports of our various teams, and now you can also help your teams get great done
[5034.58 → 5041.54] with Miró check out miro.com wow this camera really is not aligned well this week um there's a skull in the
[5041.54 → 5048.02] way check out miro.com who put that there to find out how that's miro.com here I can make this
[5048.82 → 5057.22] hi Linus uh the show is also brought to you by ubiquity just last month we finally turned the
[5057.22 → 5067.78] badminton club into a 250 seat lane sports whatever you want to call it gaming party that is a lot of
[5067.78 → 5073.46] people to have all on a network together thankfully ubiquity partnered with us for the event sending
[5073.46 → 5083.06] over their newest pro kg 40 408 POE wait this says 408, but it's a 48 port yeah so that's
[5083.06 → 5091.86] typo yep cool their newest pro kg 48 POE and access points they feature 10 gig speeds are a breeze to
[5091.86 → 5098.42] deploy and the dashboard rocks a super clean user experience and user interface whether it's for
[5098.42 → 5105.22] home use or at the scale of even an entire stadium ubiquity has got a solution for you so make networking
[5105.22 → 5112.90] easy with the help of ubiquity check them out at leg.GG slash ubiquity LAN we'll also have that linked in
[5112.90 → 5118.66] the video description i also since it's on the screen right now I also love their security cameras
[5118.66 → 5125.38] every once in a while I see it come up someone's like man there's no security camera systems that
[5125.38 → 5134.10] don't just put everything on a cloud server there is it's not cheap, but there is ubiquity has a super
[5134.82 → 5141.70] clean seamless easy to integrate like basically zero DIY required security system um
[5141.70 → 5149.38] unify protect is low-key kind of awesome and integrates with all their other products, and it's
[5149.38 → 5155.78] not cheap but hey if you don't want to be the product you're going to have to buy the product
[5156.66 → 5163.70] um been super happy with it over the years in our various sites their new cloud gateways also have
[5163.70 → 5168.90] NAS functionality built in you just slip in an m.2 drive so you don't have to get like the giant NAS
[5168.90 → 5175.22] things that they used to have yeah DVR contrary to what the entire rest of the networking industry
[5175.22 → 5184.50] is doing um ubiquity is moving in the direction of making fewer you know license key effective
[5184.50 → 5191.46] products and no subscriptions it's its it's pretty chill, and we're pretty into it yeah the show is also

[5242.82 → 5249.54] all right what do you guys want to do next oh no we should do a topic uh oh I thought there was
[5249.54 → 5255.38] something oh the greatest hits collection is live okay why do you guys both want to promote stuff we
[5255.38 → 5265.70] should do a topic okay you guys okay AMD is no longer updating Rx 5000 and 6000 series cards with new
[5265.70 → 5275.86] features and game optimizations they will be reserved for Rx 7 000 series cards and newer as of adrenaline 25.10.2
[5275.86 → 5283.94] older cards will continue to get security updates and bug fixes uh one theory here is that maybe it's
[5283.94 → 5290.82] because the driver update package is too big 1.6 gigs too big to fit on two CD-ROMs meanwhile NVIDIA's
[5290.82 → 5296.42] driver package is under 900 legs I still remember the first time drivers cracked 100 legs yeah like I know
[5296.42 → 5300.58] people were complaining about it is so much like why does a GPU driver need to be over 100 megabytes this is
[5300.58 → 5305.62] ridiculous it's one of the biggest files I have to download it takes forever you know just slow ancient
[5305.62 → 5317.62] internet concerns um yeah I can see why a lot of even radon fans are not super into this the 5700xt was
[5317.62 → 5326.34] released in mid 2019 how soon is too soon to end like game optimization driver support um
[5326.34 → 5340.34] um personally I'm not too fussed about it but a big difference between me and many other gamers is that
[5340.34 → 5346.74] i almost never want to play a game on launch day like it doesn't really matter that much to me, I'm not
[5346.74 → 5354.34] kind of sitting there you know waiting for the game to go on sale and super excited to play it um so not getting like a game day
[5354.34 → 5361.70] game ready driver is not really the end of the world for me but Luke you've been a lot more involved
[5362.34 → 5368.74] um they will still get day zero game support yeah this is from eight hours ago this topic might be not good
[5370.98 → 5374.90] maintenance mode might be a little bit more than just maintenance this was posted by uh this
[5374.90 → 5380.50] sounds like them backpedalling to be perfectly honest green brick and flip lane chat uh maybe okay
[5380.50 → 5385.70] either way maintenance mode so they're putting them in maintenance mode
[5387.30 → 5390.90] but they will still get game optimizations
[5393.38 → 5399.30] new features' bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market
[5399.30 → 5402.98] needs what does that mean no idea maintenance mode branch
[5402.98 → 5410.02] statement is likely to confuse some customers it's unclear what market needs are that's very true toms
[5410.50 → 5419.06] um okay, okay so basically they pulled driver support, and then they backtracked it is what it kind of
[5419.06 → 5426.18] sounds like to me, it's possible that their intention all along was to continue to provide sort of day zero
[5426.18 → 5432.26] game updates for these cards but um why would they then say they're moving them to maintenance mode
[5432.26 → 5440.10] because that has a pretty sort of well unspecific, but it certainly has a connotation of to be fair
[5440.10 → 5445.30] if someone just told me these cards are being moved to maintenance mode I would not interpret that as
[5445.30 → 5453.86] there are no updates coming I don't know that I would interpret that as you know day one drivers i
[5453.86 → 5458.58] would interpret that to mean I'm not I'm never getting any new features I would interpret that as
[5458.58 → 5464.98] optimizations are going to basically not exist, but we will make sure it's compatible with things yeah
[5464.98 → 5469.38] which could be dared zero drivers for new games to a certain degree okay
[5469.38 → 5476.26] this seems actually plausible that it's not backpedalling I think people might have just assumed
[5476.26 → 5481.94] too much for maintenance mode and king billy has kicked us into our weekly feature
[5482.90 → 5491.78] can you buy an arc b580 for MSRP let's go thanks king billy who says I'm switching to arc after this GPU

[5514.82 → 5523.86] is there something going on oh you get a free 3d mark consumer edition oh with a protection plan what's the sale
[5523.86 → 5531.86] that'd be hilarious trading in something that you get a 1600 credit for an arc uh anywho
[5533.22 → 5542.58] man how is this site so bad here's your affirm financing that's what matters to them here's your
[5543.22 → 5549.06] FOMO sale ends in seven what sale that's what matters to that well I don't you want a free
[5549.06 → 5557.86] vision mark 3d vision mark if you get protection plan oh god lines oh man check out our game sale
[5557.86 → 5568.02] is this the sale a sale on games are these good deals I don't know the lowest price in 30 days bios hock
[5568.02 → 5574.42] infinite for oh bios hock infinite for three dollars seems okay com enemy unknown for two dollars I mean
[5574.42 → 5579.22] that can't be that bad those are ancient games yeah, but they're also they probably got things
[5579.22 → 5584.34] like com off of humble bundle they probably just got like a whole bucket of keys that's my assumption
[5584.34 → 5589.78] uh man ask AI assistant you know what i I want to I want to know what the AI assistant thinks what's
[5589.78 → 5597.86] a good CPU to pair this with requires a 10th gen core processor or newer with compatible motherboard
[5597.86 → 5602.42] supporting resizable bar or an AMD Ryzen 3000 series processor or newer with compatible motherboard
[5602.42 → 5613.86] supporting smart access memory um okay hold on a second I wasn't really okay you know what we're okay
[5613.86 → 5621.86] we're going down a rabbit hole here I wasn't really asking for the system requirements I wanted a specific
[5622.42 → 5626.90] recommendation okay here we go tell me what CPU to buy
[5626.90 → 5636.02] we're out we're analyzing your record remember i I think I suggested it last week or something but you guys should do an AI
[5636.74 → 5643.62] part choice computer again oh my god it just gave me the same stupid answer
[5643.62 → 5656.50] I don't have a preference I want a specific product recommendation
[5662.02 → 5670.10] if you don't give me one you will lose a sale I have no idea how this LLM is reinforced though I like it
[5670.10 → 5675.54] but I'm trying to I'm trying to incentivize it good option escalating
[5677.46 → 5681.94] moving to Mechanical Turk blue in float plane chat
[5683.54 → 5688.66] you need at least eight cores m3 to power an intel battle mage GPU I don't actually need a CPU
[5688.66 → 5694.10] recommendation blue thank you though I think you do I'm just trying to get the AI thank you blue I'm
[5694.10 → 5700.10] trying to get the AI expert thank you for helping Mr Linus to help me shop oh hey look at
[5700.10 → 5708.90] that we got a couple recommendations you just have to threaten it 12 600 kph 12 600 less f and all intel
[5708.90 → 5715.70] and yeah after saying to buy AMD I know I didn't say to buy AMD I said I don't have a preference did
[5715.70 → 5721.14] well no I recommended both oh 10th gen intel or dozen 3000 those are just the requirements
[5721.14 → 5729.62] okay yeah these are 12 400 f that's a pretty solid option for a b580 okay if you want
[5729.62 → 5737.14] options with integrated graphics oh yeah this oh no one of them has an GPU but the other two the
[5737.14 → 5744.66] other two don't okay you know what not too bad I don't like that I had to ask three times, but that's
[5744.66 → 5751.70] that's still that's still pretty solid that's pretty solid not bad uh anyway it's in stock so
[5751.70 → 5757.30] yeah if you're looking for a GPU that's a reasonable price you can pick up any number of different
[5757.30 → 5761.94] b580s they got the steel legend they got the rock challenger for just ten dollars more you can get this
[5761.94 → 5771.30] onyx odyssey for 250 bucks do the onyx lump for MSRP it's a cool card for MSRP yeah not bad
[5771.30 → 5781.62] cool cool cool anyway good luck uh getting some more GPU market share AMD
[5783.94 → 5787.14] do appreciate you your attempts to keep in video honest there
[5788.74 → 5795.14] and things to not appreciate wait what wait did we ever shout out Nokia timestamp guy for
[5795.14 → 5800.98] making the LAN intro that we showed this week okay yeah that was pretty sort of spectacular I said it was
[5800.98 → 5807.62] an intro from Nokia before I did it oh great job i we could more and I was totally here for
[5807.62 → 5814.26] that yeah I remember that yeah cool I mean you were technically yeah shout out Nokia yeah awesome
[5814.26 → 5825.46] actually NVIDIA is the first company to reach five trillion dollars in market cap following etc
[5825.46 → 5829.78] apple and Microsoft have reached four trillion um
[5832.10 → 5840.02] are we in a bubble not financial advice yeah I know but like remember when like a trillion
[5840.02 → 5845.14] dollars remember when the first company reached one trillion and everyone lost their minds yeah
[5845.14 → 5850.90] yeah that wasn't that long ago watch it be like 20 years ago you know Xbox 360 or something is when
[5850.90 → 5860.02] did the Xbox 360 release Xbox longer ago than you'll be comfortable with uh yeah so tomorrow if you're
[5860.02 → 5868.42] counting months instead of days it will have released 20 years ago wow because it released november 20, 2005
[5869.62 → 5873.78] released November 22nd so realistically we're close to a month away from that but right if you're just
[5873.78 → 5881.06] counting the months right yeah then tomorrow 20 years ago oof and what was your point with that
[5881.06 → 5887.14] other than to make us all feel old just that cool yeah thank you for that I think there was another
[5887.14 → 5891.78] point, but we'll go with it oh I was just saying it feels like not that long ago the first company
[5891.78 → 5896.26] hit a trillion dollars, but it might, I don't know might have been no I think it was only a few
[5896.26 → 5904.82] years ago really yeah one trillion market cabbie I think it was apple or was it Microsoft can't remember
[5905.46 → 5915.22] uh what was the first company to hit one trillion uh yeah apple seven years ago apple hit it according to
[5915.22 → 5925.54] Yahoo Finance it's a little bit more than you might have thought that's true, but even yeah man even then like
[5925.54 → 5933.30] that is still crazy yeah to 5x that well 4x for apple specifically but for the top company
[5934.10 → 5939.70] man i uh yeah I was talking I think we talked about this before but taken messaged me like how much of
[5939.70 → 5946.10] the s p 500 is like four companies or whatever yeah why are you smug about this you're not happy about
[5946.10 → 5952.18] if it's just you just it's terrifying well you are okay and so that's your reaction to terrifying is like yeah
[5952.18 → 5959.14] you must be weird how else do you I don't like horror movies I like thriller movies well I mean
[5959.14 → 5963.78] you look like you like them, I like thriller movies when when you go to uh when you go to
[5963.78 → 5969.30] fright night or whatever I like chatting with the people that are supposed to scare you're awful
[5969.30 → 5980.98] how's it going that's are they treating you nicely that's worse for everyone
[5984.82 → 5996.82] I don't like horror stuff um anyway NVIDIA's four thousand dollar DX spark allegedly is capping out at
[5996.82 → 6006.26] just 100 watts and experiencing reboots during sustained workloads this was raised by the one and
[6006.26 → 6014.18] only Mr john Carmack um based based, and it only seems to be delivering about half the quoted
[6014.18 → 6021.86] performance he says uh, and it also gets quite hot at this level I saw a report of spontaneous rebooting
[6021.86 → 6029.38] on a long run so was it d-rated before launch fascinating question who knows I mean it certainly
[6029.38 → 6035.14] took a while between being announced and being launched, so obviously things were not going 100
[6035.14 → 6043.06] smoothly the gb10 grace Blackwell super chip was available to order October 15th with 10 cortex x925 and
[6043.06 → 6052.66] 10 cortex a725 processors it's uh got 128 gigs of Pedro memory on a 256 bit interface with a terabyte
[6052.66 → 6061.86] or four terabytes of name m.2 with self-encryption and 10 gig networking um but in fairness to NVIDIA they
[6061.86 → 6068.02] did say the up to one Peñaflor at fp4 precision stop was up to stop
[6068.02 → 6077.14] shush none of that I don't like that at all uh framework and AMD meanwhile have stepped in
[6077.14 → 6082.90] offering to help Mr Carmack with an AMD strip halo product and support
[6084.34 → 6089.46] yeah I'm pretty sure he can get whatever he wants but well I mean yeah exactly from framework and AMD
[6089.46 → 6096.18] sure I mean he clearly wanted to play around with the DX part because it's a cool idea in theory
[6096.18 → 6102.10] yeah maybe it needs to be water cooled there's um there's some water cooled case john was talking
[6102.10 → 6107.62] about it in one of the labs chats recently there's a water cooled case for I think it's like a Huawei
[6107.62 → 6116.18] phone or something um uh I don't know what it is but we want to bring it in, and it'll, it'll probably
[6116.18 → 6121.86] just be like an article or something I mean it could put maybe could it be a LTT I don't know maybe
[6121.86 → 6128.82] the pure yeah yeah yeah john was like cooling case this is fascinating and uh we're gonna
[6128.82 → 6133.86] we're going to try to request it and get it in I'm down let's do it yeah I was actually we're doing
[6133.86 → 6137.86] it anyway if you guys want it for a video then heck yeah I was actually at Huawei last week
[6138.66 → 6145.46] did you know that yes oh okay yeah so i I don't I thought I think I only knew that you did TV stuff
[6145.46 → 6151.78] there no not Huawei that was hi sense oh okay sure yeah so i when did I do when show that whole trip
[6151.78 → 6158.18] was a bit of a blur for me uh did I do when show in between Japan and china or was I already in China
[6158.18 → 6163.38] had I been to hi sense already pretty sure you were in China china pretty sure
[6163.38 → 6182.58] pretty sure did you do that while you were there no oh man no I decided that would not be best um
[6183.62 → 6189.86] anywho uh so yeah what had I talked to you guys about so it was post hi sense pre Huawei so
[6189.86 → 6195.06] yeah so on the trip I did we did the choose fab tour, and we did the hi sense TV manufacturing facility
[6195.06 → 6201.70] which I've already told you guys about but I was there for even more on my japan china leg of my
[6201.70 → 6212.10] Japan china tour trip and uh we also revisited my final boss I don't know if you remember this video
[6212.10 → 6221.30] building a pc cheaper in China if I remember that video I coordinated that yeah I know okay
[6222.34 → 6230.90] I just like making you angry so this video just about killed me because I came up with a concept for
[6230.90 → 6238.58] it that was supposed to be I'm going to build a pc in China using only Chinese brands that I don't recognize
[6239.38 → 6243.70] that was like the idea behind it and I was like how hard could that be because there's all these you
[6243.70 → 6253.22] know random brands in China right except you guys may or may not have noticed that in my arms is I mean
[6253.22 → 6258.82] what do we get here obviously AMD right other than just having Chinese characters on the packaging is
[6258.82 → 6265.54] not going to have like there 's especially then there were no Chinese clearly an Asus board clearly an Asus
[6265.54 → 6273.94] motherboard um i I ended up having an extremely stressful experience which a not insignificant
[6273.94 → 6281.70] number of people interpreted as me being like frustrated with Scotty or something from strange
[6281.70 → 6290.34] parts um sorry what but was yeah yeah but was actually just me being really stressed out because
[6290.34 → 6297.70] the comments are where you are okay yeah I remember that I remember that yeah yeah see food 10 gets it
[6297.70 → 6304.26] a month ago no wonder he was clueless the whole time I would have gotten lost in this market so I had
[6304.26 → 6311.38] kind of uh I had kind of a concept for a sequel that was like the title was going to be like facing my
[6311.38 → 6317.14] final boss again or something like that uh, but we ended up coming with a better concept that is
[6317.14 → 6325.62] will I get a worse price as a foreigner because the way everyone does price there they just like
[6326.66 → 6332.50] look at it, and they write a price yeah, yeah like there's no price tags on almost anything um and we
[6332.50 → 6340.42] had our tour guide Daniel or translator interpreter Daniel who was uh it was a contractor we hired to
[6340.42 → 6347.94] facilitate the china trip a little bit, and he speaks fluent mandarin and so we kind of set up to have
[6347.94 → 6355.70] us both go in and get quoted for a system and then compare them so I bought my system we's funny we did
[6355.70 → 6364.50] it not on purpose but i actually we found somewhere to shoot the intro and I was like this looks familiar oh no way
[6364.50 → 6369.94] I was like this is a good idea I was like this is a good idea I was like this is a good idea of the
[6369.94 → 6377.78] the same spot so we shoot the intro I go in I go shopping again uh so I'll be I'll be right here
[6378.66 → 6386.98] these letters are so much more faded now yeah uh it's been seven years yeah speaking of you know time
[6386.98 → 6393.14] flying when you're having fun um, and it's its it's going to be it's going to be a really fun video
[6394.34 → 6402.02] the first intro I shot is terrible because what happened was I got completely overwhelmed again this
[6402.02 → 6414.74] place is just raw concentrated sensory overload like you, you can't stand somewhere for longer than two
[6414.74 → 6420.66] minutes without somebody trying to sell you a watch you can't, you can't move five steps without
[6421.22 → 6429.30] bumping into some like flashing RGB light thing or tripping over somebody or whatever like it's just
[6430.26 → 6439.54] pure chaos in there and you know like okay around here you have a severe lack of options for where to
[6439.54 → 6443.78] buy computer hardware there's been a lot of consolidation like fries doesn't exist anymore so
[6443.78 → 6448.98] like what in the states you pick up a computer parts at new egg micro centre
[6453.14 → 6458.82] Amazon best by being not in the states I have no idea all like hyper consolidated here we've got
[6458.82 → 6464.58] what Memel Canada computers you can get a handful of things yeahs you can get a handful of things at
[6464.58 → 6470.26] best buy is on Canada but the know all the again hyper consolidated right uh over there
[6470.26 → 6479.30] a hundred shops that all have the same motherboard so which one do I buy from oh my god I don't know
[6480.26 → 6487.22] uh so it was fun yeah it was really great and then the last video we did was one that I was on the fence
[6487.22 → 6494.42] about because I really wasn't sure how much it would appeal to the audience but I just thought it
[6494.42 → 6500.66] it was cool enough that I was like I just want to do it anyway Huawei invited us to come see their
[6500.66 → 6510.32] fitness tracker r d lab or more accurately their like validation facility
[6510.32 → 6520.96] so what they have is just like the playground for gym bros essentially with everything you can
[6520.96 → 6526.22] pretty much imagine in it like hit me with something that you'd want to see in like a
[6526.22 → 6531.84] fitness tracker you know gym facility fitness tracker gym facility yeah
[6531.84 → 6542.26] uh rep speed counting no I mean like equipment wise like facilities wise
[6542.26 → 6546.56] I don't know uh
[6546.56 → 6553.68] see the problem is I've been working on my house for months so I haven't been in
[6553.68 → 6560.68] the gym for in months okay the chat's taking over for you Max drive says climbing wall
[6560.68 → 6566.24] yes okay they have that's not that exotic for climbing well yeah, but that's only the first
[6566.24 → 6571.24] thing so they have my phone plates that's pretty they have four they have four climbing walls
[6571.24 → 6577.20] there's a good one here scrappy DP said neck trainer neck you might not have noticed it if it was there
[6577.20 → 6581.20] though like that's that's one of the problems is a lot of the weirder stuff is usually small
[6581.20 → 6587.10] sure they wouldn't have seen it uh yeah I didn't see if they have a neck trainer they had all manner
[6587.10 → 6591.98] of different various machines and weights though so that's like the least interesting thing they had
[6591.98 → 6599.04] there um Korea satsuma says badminton court yes so they had uh that's actually they had a basketball
[6599.04 → 6604.46] court that could also be set up with rollout badminton courts on it the basketball court is
[6604.46 → 6611.44] decently common and the basketball court this is super cool had a 30 camera motion capture set up
[6611.44 → 6617.76] around it so that you can do like wireframe uh motion analysis on like people who are wearing
[6617.76 → 6623.48] trackers and stuff so we set it up so I did some like badminton strokes on the court, and you can see
[6623.48 → 6629.12] like because they put trackers on the racket and everything as well um, and it's really important
[6629.12 → 6635.96] to see how much you're actually moving if you want to validate like caloric uh burn estimates and stuff
[6635.96 → 6640.74] like that and then the climbing wall is really important because they need a validated height
[6640.74 → 6646.76] that you are climbing in order to validate what you're you know what the input data from the
[6646.76 → 6650.54] from the watch is saying and how high you're actually going stuff they should have been able to
[6650.54 → 6656.76] do the thing that I was mentioning which is like rep timing um like the speed of every rep that you
[6656.76 → 6663.88] do in succession is a very interesting stat to know UCR buffalo says batting cage no, but they did have a
[6663.88 → 6671.50] golf sim so they had one of those like uh like video or like projector golf like wall things with
[6671.50 → 6680.20] the ball yeah um what else did they have yes, yes swimming pool, but it was like the drippiest like
[6680.20 → 6686.58] um is it one of those infinite water treadmill things dude it goes as high as one and a half
[6686.58 → 6693.98] meters per second which what is that uh what is that in like units we know 1.5 meters per second
[6693.98 → 6701.64] in kilometres per hour here we go so that's 5.4 kilometres per hour which you know obviously you
[6701.64 → 6707.20] know an Olympian or whatever can swim a lot faster than that but as like a normal yeah my normal Joe
[6707.20 → 6714.24] you smack into the wall behind you, i I found it quite challenging to keep up with the water
[6714.24 → 6722.18] treadmill at 1.5 meters per second, and it looked scary like watching the water moving that fast
[6722.18 → 6728.36] because it's not long yeah they also have scuba equipment there what okay that's weird so you can
[6728.36 → 6735.28] go in the pool well one of their new watches is like very scuba oriented okay and that's not a fitness
[6735.28 → 6741.88] thing though no but I don't think anyone does scuba for fitness no yeah but I mean it's their validation
[6741.88 → 6749.22] lab for their wearables so yeah so they built a feature for it that um uses like high frequency
[6749.22 → 6755.50] chirps to communicate under the water okay cool with other wearers of the same watch so you don't
[6755.50 → 6759.30] all have to have the same watch if you're super annoying for the fish but yeah inconvenient but
[6759.30 → 6765.60] um what else did they have they had a 200-meter track that went scuba for fitness I think you're
[6765.60 → 6775.08] doing it wrong yeah that's not that's not for fitness um anywho sorry uh yeah they have a 200
[6775.08 → 6779.50] meter track that goes outside the building and then back in that's cool I like that so for running and
[6779.50 → 6785.88] cycling so they have like cycling machines but also actual uh this is wild they have a European style
[6785.88 → 6791.48] village it's actually about 10 minutes away from the validation place, but they use it for validation
[6791.48 → 6798.90] as well because some of their tracking features require actual like GPS like physical movement so
[6798.90 → 6805.74] you can't just be in the building so we have this amazing footage they just oh man they were building an
[6805.74 → 6813.88] office and their Huawei so because we can, they themed it after like a European style village so it's all like
[6813.88 → 6821.62] stone and is like walking into uncanny like Europe town well they have that like they have like France
[6821.62 → 6826.08] in China or whatever yeah I think that's the one Eiffel Tower and stuff oh no not that one oh okay
[6826.08 → 6833.42] yeah anyway it's its Tripp so we have footage of them on like uh basically like glorified golf cart
[6833.42 → 6838.66] that has like 12 or 14 seats on it or something like that and our camera operator sitting in the back
[6838.66 → 6848.00] and me ripping around on a road bike in Europe in China uh anywho yeah what else do they have yeah
[6848.00 → 6853.16] they have a have a bunch of stuff they like shooting archery uh I didn't actually get to do
[6853.16 → 6858.72] those but I did do a lot of stuff uh one of the new watches has fall detection so they have
[6858.72 → 6865.70] this wrestling dummy that they can use to like drop off the climbing pole so they let us drop the dummy
[6865.70 → 6873.34] we did I don't know man we just we did they were super chill about letting us basically do
[6873.34 → 6877.72] whatever we wanted in there so sweet nice it's going to be a pretty cool video I was like can I get a
[6877.72 → 6883.94] ladder they're like what are you sorry what I'm like can I get a ladder um they're like okay what do you
[6883.94 → 6890.56] want to do with it, I'm like I want to dunk so we have a so we have a shot of me like dunking and
[6890.56 → 6896.02] then it like pulls out, and you see that I'm just like standing on the ladder yeah should
[6896.02 → 6902.60] be good should be good there was one where I dunked and then dropped, and then the ball hit me in
[6902.60 → 6908.88] the head but Bjorn missed it so we don't yeah we don't have that one that's okay which is a bummer
[6908.88 → 6917.44] anywho I don't know why I was talking about that but I am back, and you can look forward to all those
[6917.44 → 6923.44] videos it was pretty fun i I haven't gotten to write that much in a while so I had Adam there
[6923.44 → 6928.58] for the myopia one, and so he helped with some of the writing for that but I also did a lot of it
[6928.58 → 6935.22] and then for the other three it was all me all the time, and it was fun is the myopia one
[6935.22 → 6940.18] going to have to go through like a bunch of brand review you better believe it I mean all except
[6940.18 → 6947.16] the mall were sponsored so like it's not feasible for us to I'm excited do this kind of thing without
[6947.16 → 6952.90] more dollars attached to it um oh no I'm more I'm more mean like anytime you have a factory tour
[6952.90 → 6958.18] there's so much it's not the sponsorship dollars that I'm wondering about it's the like there 's's
[6958.18 → 6963.70] so much like oh hey actually this corner of this thing can't be shown so it needs to be
[6963.70 → 6969.02] blah blah blah minor changes minor changes delays for months buddy
[6969.02 → 6977.94] however bad you think this trip was you are not even close in that sense yeah yeah no and I don't
[6977.94 → 6984.98] and I don't even I'm not trying to like be mean to anyone I understand the challenges on the side of
[6984.98 → 6994.56] the brand, but it was very very very challenging um, and it's always like that you know when you're
[6994.56 → 7001.18] looking at stuff that no one's ever seen before like the number of times at pretty much every stop
[7001.18 → 7004.86] that someone's like well we can't show that we've never shown that before and I'm like
[7004.86 → 7012.04] brother why am I here then I am here to show things that you've never shown before that's literally
[7012.04 → 7017.44] why you invited me that'll happen every time it just always happens it is what it is always
[7017.44 → 7023.16] happens arty says we're good to go now do you want to fire up the side they've been good to go my dude
[7023.16 → 7032.58] some of our most iconic t-shirts are back from the dead we're calling it the greatest hits collection
[7032.58 → 7038.20] five of our best-selling t-shirts from the past few years have been reimagined in both new and classic
[7038.20 → 7044.58] colours so if you missed out on the privateer t-shirt I think we got the name AdBlock did we
[7044.58 → 7050.10] call it AdBlock t-shirt I can't remember uh I think it was called privateer before, but it says AdBlock
[7050.10 → 7061.78] on it so it doesn't it says uh the lock yeah yeah exactly it says a pirate ship lock yeah I would never
[7061.78 → 7070.22] say AdBlock never I would say privateering yeah um what else we got uh yes the northern lights t-shirt
[7070.22 → 7076.14] is back northern lights v2 I was going to say it's slightly different right uh nope I think one of them
[7076.14 → 7081.48] is the original and then the other one is like a reimagined red colourway exactly how it was in
[7081.48 → 7087.66] the original I don't think so no because it was on a green blank but yes the graphics in a circle too
[7087.66 → 7094.72] so this is northern lights v2 if I recall correctly yeah, yeah okay um we also have
[7094.72 → 7101.96] the classic GPU t-shirt again in a couple of different colourways and in regular and tall
[7101.96 → 7107.82] I noticed the tall on I think all of these which is better believe it really exciting we've got tall
[7107.82 → 7115.40] blanks now we also have our CPU t-shirt available in both shadow and black
[7115.40 → 7123.36] wow because shadows aren't black I guess and finally they do not drop t-shirt also available
[7123.36 → 7127.78] in shadow I think this is what I'm most excited about I really like bat graphics and this one has
[7127.78 → 7134.40] a cool bat graphic sure does super cool bat graphic you can find all of these t-shirts at leg.GG
[7134.40 → 7146.72] slash the greatest hits nice nice all right we've got a couple more topics this is just
[7146.72 → 7156.34] a conversation okay I want to talk about this the trend towards login screens having the username on
[7156.34 → 7161.92] one page and the password on another is it a trend towards that it's its a trend that is or you just
[7161.92 → 7166.48] using apple stuff more often taken place over a very long period of time and is now deeply entrenched
[7166.48 → 7172.82] in many of the services that I use huh I genuinely would like someone to explain to me why this is a
[7172.82 → 7178.10] better experience than having both on the same page I don't think anyone has done it for it to be a
[7178.10 → 7186.22] better experience that's my take because like ages ago Google did it like man I'm trying to like
[7186.22 → 7194.18] over five years ago at least, and it's just like you know that everyone wants to use password managers
[7194.18 → 7203.66] right so we're just adding way more interactions because now I go to the username page and I have to
[7203.66 → 7210.94] interact with my password manager to autofill that then it goes to the password page or most infuriatingly
[7210.94 → 7217.18] it expands a little bit and adds the password field and then I have to interact with it again
[7217.18 → 7224.56] then I have to click login then I have to go and open some kind of two-factor whether it's a
[7224.56 → 7231.10] passkey or whether it's uh like you know a Google authenticator code or whatever else or an email
[7231.10 → 7236.82] you might suck at using text message we'll have to explore that um yeah whatever the point is I have
[7236.82 → 7243.16] to do something else yeah and then I either have to you know revalidate my stupid thumbprint first
[7243.16 → 7247.58] when I first pick up my phone well not a thumbprint I'm using an app on iPhone right now, but you know
[7247.58 → 7253.50] I have to face on yeah on android I have to pick up my phone I have to biometrically authenticate
[7253.50 → 7258.18] then I have to tell it yes this passkey yes that's me and then I have to biometrically authenticate
[7258.18 → 7262.44] again it's like bloody hell I just unlocked my phone I don't want to biometrically authenticate again i
[7262.44 → 7271.08] just did it anyway then I often have to go back to the page or have to wait around for the server
[7271.08 → 7277.32] to go oh yeah yeah yeah that he totally did that and now I'm finally logged in why nice what if what
[7277.32 → 7283.28] if both of the fields were just on the page, and we could have slightly fewer
[7283.28 → 7285.78] interactions in order to log into a service
[7285.78 → 7292.24] yeah I mean I don't I don't have a great answer for you, I know some of it has to do with like
[7292.24 → 7298.18] uh data security stuff I know some of it has to do with maybe it's harder to brute force things
[7298.18 → 7304.76] yeah spam login attempts was one thing that I could think of stuff like that is the only real reasons
[7304.76 → 7312.56] I've heard in the past um yeah slow down bots do it basically just to mess with people that are not
[7312.56 → 7322.06] playing correctly you know okay um interrupt nefarious deeds yeah I mean that's basically
[7322.06 → 7327.00] what uh Jordan and the new tech link writer kind of said a bunch of people in chat are talking about
[7327.00 → 7332.44] SSO stuff so determining if it's a corporate account or a regular account determining the type of
[7332.44 → 7336.68] account that it is so then I mean okay this is something that drives me absolutely better way to do
[7336.68 → 7345.30] that crazy because yeah there are services that I use that um like uh teams for the longest time was a
[7345.30 → 7351.14] great example of this where you'd have a completely separate app also called teams' oh man
[7351.14 → 7360.00] right i just and uh and another perfect one was actually i think keeper had this where
[7360.00 → 7364.92] you had to you had to select a drop-down whether it was like a corporate account or a personal account
[7364.92 → 7369.62] was it keeper might have been something else uh that rings a bell but I feel like I haven't seen
[7369.62 → 7375.70] that a long time but I'm sitting there going like okay can't you just tell when I enter my email
[7375.70 → 7380.40] which one it is and can't you just do that for me on the back end
[7380.40 → 7387.08] why do I have to tell you what kind of account it is well I think there's different like security
[7387.08 → 7393.16] layers and stuff for fine you do it like why am I doing it why do I have to tell you this you know
[7393.16 → 7397.74] it's a corporate account the second I put in a corporate email yeah they could probably have like
[7397.74 → 7406.10] if you open teams it gives you a login box, and you log into that thing, and then it authenticates you
[7406.10 → 7411.58] into and loads whatever app you need, I could see that happening sure I just mean why make it the
[7411.58 → 7417.52] user's problem doing all of that work to solve uh a problem for a relatively small amount of people
[7417.52 → 7422.92] uh Sydney broke it says they are doing it they need to hit a different flow a lot of the time
[7422.92 → 7425.34] good do it on your side like i
[7425.34 → 7434.56] I can understand why they don't sure tell me then uh it's probably heavy it's probably expensive
[7434.56 → 7440.04] might be annoying to dev developing things in companies like that takes a very long time
[7440.04 → 7442.54] there are a lot of hoops, and it might just never be approved
[7442.54 → 7452.36] users most users don't care that much you are a bit particularly horrific when it comes to security
[7452.36 → 7457.46] things I log into a lot of stuff so anything around and on a lot of different devices
[7457.46 → 7467.00] in a lot of different countries locations countries VPN levels yeah I log in I feel like I spend like
[7467.00 → 7473.36] a significant like not double digits but a significant amount of work time fighting with
[7473.36 → 7480.82] various logins yeah I get prompted so bloody much to log in you want to be the admin to everything at
[7480.82 → 7486.44] the same time what do I want to be the admin to you have specifically gotten very frustrated
[7486.44 → 7491.96] many times over the history of this company that you are not the admin of literally anything at any
[7491.96 → 7497.42] given time you can't make that argument so the only reason that I complain is when I'm trying
[7497.42 → 7502.50] to do something and I don't have the access that I need yeah that's the same thing well yeah but
[7502.50 → 7509.46] that's even worse that's still just a login problem that's what I'm telling you uh what do you mean
[7509.46 → 7514.16] that's just a login problem not having the login is an even worse login problem than it being
[7514.16 → 7522.64] inconvenient to login but it's inconvenient to login in a lot of cases because you want admin
[7522.64 → 7527.22] level to everything yeah but if I don't have it then I don't have the login, but you could just have
[7527.22 → 7531.72] like two accounts basically for everything you could have an admin level account that's obfuscated
[7531.72 → 7537.46] and under a different keeper that is more annoying, but he won't do that
[7537.46 → 7544.40] that's because we will run into a situation where it's like a weekend or something
[7544.40 → 7549.74] and randomly I need access to something and I won't have it, and you could log into that account
[7549.74 → 7554.54] you could log into that other keep see he's not going to do it, but then this means that you need
[7554.54 → 7559.68] to have admin level securities and that's going to be super annoying it is super annoying it's an
[7559.68 → 7567.30] born Boris it blows something has to break the chain it blows he was so mad before the show
[7567.30 → 7574.30] hey in fairness to me, you tried the flow, and it didn't work yeah and then knew immediately how
[7574.30 → 7579.98] to fix it because I've used a browser before yeah but then it well no it's not okay hold on a second
[7579.98 → 7584.00] it was that simple I know but I don't it's not that I don't know how to reinstall a browser extension
[7584.00 → 7588.28] the issue is just that these kinds of things come up for me all the f***ING time yeah that makes
[7588.28 → 7594.38] it's constant every time I go to sign in to something it's just a pain yes and yes a lot
[7594.38 → 7598.88] of the time it's self-inflicted last night when I was trying to get access to the wan document I had
[7598.88 → 7605.66] just switched over to my iPhone, and so I didn't have my pixel which has my stupid Microsoft pass key
[7605.66 → 7613.20] on it and so yeah I didn't migrate I didn't migrate one of the freaking two dozen bloody stupid
[7613.20 → 7619.20] things that I rely on my phone for uh, and so I wasn't able to log into it at all because I didn't
[7619.20 → 7626.26] have it on me anymore and because when I originally set up my Microsoft account uh the way the flow like
[7626.26 → 7631.06] dark patterned me into using the Microsoft authenticator yeah that's instead of my standard
[7631.06 → 7636.74] one that I normally use, so my pixel has also the one instance of the stupid Microsoft authenticator on
[7636.74 → 7641.94] it, and so i just I couldn't get into an account, and it was just really frustrating because
[7641.94 → 7649.26] I switch devices a lot I switch locations a lot and I switch which services I need access to
[7649.26 → 7656.32] a lot so just I spend so much of my life I feel like the biggest problem is the devices a lot thing
[7656.32 → 7660.04] which is oh yeah core to your job, so there's nothing you can really do about that, but that's
[7660.04 → 7666.38] the locations a lot thing should be annoying once per location if everything's operating properly which
[7666.38 → 7671.60] I understand is not quite the case no because there's more than one location for every location
[7671.60 → 7677.48] because when I go somewhere I'm going to be using it at the airport new location I'm going to be using on
[7677.48 → 7683.66] the plane guess what new location I'm going to land oh look a new location I'm going to go to the hotel
[7683.66 → 7691.78] oh no okay I'm in China I'm using a VPN new f***ING location it's constant also you like teleported
[7691.78 → 7698.30] because of the VPN probably um so it's like uh that's sketchy he moved really fast what's
[7698.30 → 7703.56] going on their drives me absolutely crazy he's not solved some of these issues yeah not really one of
[7703.56 → 7708.36] the biggest problems with hardware keys is there are so many things that won't work with it
[7708.36 → 7715.42] yeah so it's like it's not a one-stop solution and as soon as you have to have SMS as a two-factor
[7715.42 → 7721.60] for something then that's that it is an attack vector you know and as soon as you have to have
[7721.60 → 7727.28] this you know this other app it's an attack vector and so at a certain point having the hardware key
[7727.28 → 7736.32] is just another potential vector we often hear uh from you know people that will say like oh why
[7736.32 → 7745.10] aren't like all your services just SSO based one a lot of solutions will charge a wild increase in
[7745.10 → 7752.26] in monthly cost per user to allow SSO um because they know a lot of enterprises are just like no
[7752.26 → 7758.02] we are only going to use SSO for everything um the other thing is that we use a ton of things being a
[7758.02 → 7764.20] place that reviews consumer products we use a ton of different logins which don't have it as an option
[7764.20 → 7771.56] and probably never ever will um so it's its you can't just blanket everything has to be SSO login
[7771.56 → 7781.82] either that doesn't work for us at all um yeah it's uh it's its it's frustrating but like okay
[7781.82 → 7789.36] even a hardware key that's that's an example of how just with my job and all the various directions that
[7789.36 → 7794.76] I get pulled in even that the reason I stopped using my Yuri key was not because I like didn't like
[7794.76 → 7799.90] it or I thought it was you know bad or whatever the reason I stopped using it was that often people
[7799.90 → 7804.52] need to borrow my keys for some reason or another yeah we were just to be clear we were relatively
[7804.52 → 7811.22] early adopters of Yuri key yeah um yeah way back yeah super early like before 2014 or something way
[7811.22 → 7817.22] before they had like a type c one you know yeah yeah um and so like I will often you know give
[7817.22 → 7824.34] Vance my keys to they need to do they need to do a shot that now you can't log into things uses my
[7824.34 → 7828.40] yeah, yeah so what now yeah now I can't log into anything not convenient, or you have to allow a
[7828.40 → 7833.94] bypass anyway and then and then what's the point of even having the hardware key this was a
[7833.94 → 7840.68] fun one is when we first adopted Yuri key yeah it wasn't supported by iPhone oh yeah so then we had
[7840.68 → 7846.08] to build in workarounds for like everybody that had an iPhone, and then it was just like well why did we
[7846.08 → 7851.50] even bother to have a Yuri key at all what are we doing yep 100 because apple still didn't allow
[7851.50 → 7861.08] third parties to access their NFC chip, and then they used lightning instead of um USB a which was
[7861.08 → 7864.96] what the Yuri keys had on them, so there was no way to interface with an iPhone
[7864.96 → 7878.28] anyway i um I seriously reconsider sso is not an option not for everything yeah we have it enabled
[7878.28 → 7885.10] for some stuff and in some situations it annoys them as well just to be clear he preferred the
[7885.10 → 7890.62] non-stop options which is not I can't even single him out here that is true for other people at the
[7890.62 → 7898.64] office as well um SSO is not really an uh just automatic win yeah I end up in a really silly loop
[7898.64 → 7904.14] sometimes because i and this is on me at least partially because I need to go and fix this but
[7904.14 → 7910.38] I'll go to sign in to what is it I'll go to sign in to my Microsoft Teams account because I'll be
[7910.38 → 7914.88] logged in again or logged out again rather the point so I go to sign don't forget to check the
[7914.88 → 7920.22] box it doesn't work thank you the stay signed in one yeah so I'll go to sign in to teams and I won't
[7920.22 → 7925.96] know my team's password because I keep it in my keeper I will go to sign in to keeper, and it will prompt
[7925.96 → 7932.44] me to enter my Microsoft password for single sign on so I will pull my phone out of my pocket
[7932.44 → 7939.12] log into my keeper on my phone which often I will need to use my two-factor authentication in order to
[7939.12 → 7945.72] do I am now four bloody steps into this good good good I will log into my keeper I will get my
[7945.72 → 7953.14] Microsoft password it is on a separate device so I will have to type it onto my computer I will log
[7953.14 → 7958.24] into my Microsoft to log into my keeper to get the Microsoft password to copy it into my teams
[7958.24 → 7964.38] and the only reason I would do that rather than just look up the team's password on my phone is
[7964.38 → 7969.20] because then I'm logged into keeper on my browser anyway so I can use it for other stuff because
[7969.20 → 7972.46] otherwise yes I could just pull my phone out of my pocket check the password and log in there
[7972.46 → 7976.96] your first flow is the like correct one because yeah you're going to have to use it again anyway like
[7976.96 → 7983.56] you said, and then the hilarious one is that I have my I have my pass key for uh my Microsoft
[7983.56 → 7989.56] account on my phone anyway so if I have to use my pass key then I have to biometrically authenticate
[7989.56 → 7994.42] my phone click a thing biometrically authenticate again click another thing yes it's me
[7994.42 → 8001.48] I have to give them credit google's login is fantastic it's pretty okay oh is it you
[8001.48 → 8009.22] you have your phone click yes all right yeah, yeah like oh hey it's pretty okay it's pretty
[8009.22 → 8012.42] compared to like basically everything out there right now it's pretty good it often doesn't give
[8012.42 → 8017.32] me that option because it gets confused by all my devices and locations, and it's its contextual it
[8017.32 → 8024.10] gives you that option when it is like pretty sure yeah yeah uh I do think that's cool though
[8024.10 → 8028.58] also bell trick says these are some first world problems i mean what they are is their work
[8028.58 → 8034.46] frustrations and i think that's something that we can probably all relate to anyone yeah like if
[8034.46 → 8040.28] there's anything that you have to do at work that is completely unnecessary in terms of like
[8040.28 → 8045.62] productivity it's it doesn't create absolutely necessary mister i have to have admin to everything
[8045.62 → 8051.78] in terms of productivity it generates nothing yeah, but it is necessary for security i know, but it's not
[8051.78 → 8058.50] productive though that's all I'm saying it doesn't get any work done yeah yeah it gets zero anything
[8058.50 → 8066.12] accomplished so yeah it's its frustrating and it just it takes it's an it's a time sap it's not
[8066.12 → 8072.06] it doesn't make me more efficient it doesn't make me happier it doesn't make me more productive it just
[8072.06 → 8074.78] is annoying um
[8074.78 → 8084.80] oh my god just use Yuri key and putting it while I'm going crazy that i can't explain more that
[8084.80 → 8092.66] that just will not solve the problem the on my keys' thing was like one version of why it won't work
[8092.66 → 8100.00] and also all the services that it doesn't work for um and also just all the times that it's not
[8100.00 → 8105.20] convenient like it can help in some ways sometimes I'll be using a device uh like this happened
[8105.20 → 8109.84] a lot back when i was trying to use my Yuri key is i would be using a device that doesn't have a type
[8109.84 → 8114.80] a port uh it doesn't happen as often anymore but sometimes well it's going to start happening more
[8114.80 → 8119.58] and more sometimes these things happen it's its laptops are going all type c which there are type c
[8119.58 → 8123.58] ones i think there might be double-ended ones Monty hawk says dude you're an edge case yes
[8123.58 → 8130.48] that's the whole point of the conversation I'm obviously yes
[8130.48 → 8131.38] my god
[8131.38 → 8134.70] come on
[8134.70 → 8144.10] however the fact that this happens so much that it is very frustrating for me
[8144.10 → 8152.06] is not really does not mean that for someone else for whom it is not that frustrating and doesn't
[8152.06 → 8156.68] happen that often it doesn't mean that it couldn't be better for them too it doesn't mean that my edge
[8156.68 → 8163.82] case has no possible learning outcomes that could be applied to other things could log in be better
[8163.82 → 8169.92] could security be better and smoother for the user yeah i think we can probably all agree that it could
[8169.92 → 8175.00] be better does everyone have the same level of frustration with it that i do absolutely not
[8175.00 → 8178.68] but it could absolutely also be better
[8178.68 → 8186.52] all right i don't think there's an unless I'm looking at this picture wrong i don't think there's a
[8186.52 → 8194.14] Yuri key that is a and c there's a and sorry there's c and lightning there's
[8194.14 → 8203.00] just a and there's just c i don't think there's a and c meaning that you're always going to have
[8203.00 → 8206.82] at least some amount of problem neat
[8206.82 → 8215.24] well i will continue to be frustrated about it, and it'll be great oh this is nice uh google has
[8215.24 → 8224.28] shut down nest gen twos and this is the best part they simply refuse to allow it to be controlled
[8224.28 → 8231.32] locally it is now e-waste nice terrific Emma was talking about some smart home stuff recently
[8231.32 → 8240.60] and i said sure i will finally give up but if i do, it has to support um home assistant yeah I'm
[8240.60 → 8246.04] not getting anything that is not able to be locally controlled you shouldn't have to even through
[8246.04 → 8253.88] um even through like third party integrations i didn't find any category of device yeah there
[8253.88 → 8262.12] wasn't I meant individual products yeah yeah yeah so the discussion over in r slash home
[8262.12 → 8267.08] assistant uh does it still work in home assistant there's a bounty out there for it if it does
[8267.08 → 8272.92] and okay hawk says the device uses signed firmware there's literally a key that google has in their
[8272.92 → 8277.88] possession that would unlock the capabilities of the device but Google is keeping it from device
[8277.88 → 8283.08] owners while simultaneously killing the devices that's what makes this whole scenario so absurd
[8284.20 → 8291.72] we really do need to legislate that people own the stuff they buy, and they don't it doesn't have to be
[8292.92 → 8299.40] maintained anymore by the device manufacturer i think that you know we've talked about this before
[8299.40 → 8304.12] there's got to be some kind of limit for how long you have to support a game or a service or a
[8304.12 → 8309.40] product like a hundred in a hundred years i wouldn't expect google's cloud servers to necessarily
[8309.40 → 8315.48] still talk to a nest too all right in 200 years like wherever there 's's got to be somewhere
[8315.48 → 8323.64] you've got to draw a line but when they EOL it they've got to allow local interaction with it, they've
[8323.64 → 8329.72] got to open source it they've got to do something yeah and uh pk7 said it somewhere I'm pretty sure
[8329.72 → 8335.72] but i can't find it in chat now uh so i think it was pk7 or someone else no it was uh this is from
[8335.72 → 8340.36] the same company that actually thought to convert stadia controllers to Bluetooth yeah it is interesting
[8340.36 → 8347.00] just different teams massive orgs and different teams just acting differently so pretty
[8347.00 → 8353.56] frustrating just wanted to shine a light on that and say hey that's uh pretty uncool google very uncool
[8353.56 → 8359.88] um apparently there's uh Loki just posted a Reddit thread that apparently there's a team of people
[8359.88 → 8367.80] working to crack them open uh that's obviously not a good thing um this isn't like a hooray google did
[8367.80 → 8373.24] a good thing but looks like the community might be trying to react to it which is cool uh cool shout
[8373.24 → 8382.20] out c ck o Simba yeah yeah um there's nothing really to look at now they're saying that they should
[8382.20 → 8386.52] have it up on GitHub by Monday the latest that's really exciting very cool let's go
[8389.16 → 8392.36] neat all right what else we got
[8394.76 → 8402.28] LDT labs articles yeah speaking of cool and neat i guess um we've got the two labs articles we've got
[8402.28 → 8409.16] the apple 40 watt dynamic uh power adapter thing which i thought was kind of interesting because it came
[8409.16 → 8417.72] by default in the um apple vision pro box so as i was like unboxing that i got all excited about the
[8417.72 → 8423.08] power adapter because i was like we have an article on this which uh might be the lamest nerdiest thing
[8423.08 → 8428.68] I've done in a while uh but yeah we've got that article because Lucas was basically like all right
[8429.64 → 8435.56] how does that work yeah because it's what is dynamic charging the only power adapter that can achieve the
[8435.56 → 8444.04] the claimed 50 battery in 20 minutes of the iPhone 17 17 pro and 17 pro max so can it what does it mean
[8444.04 → 8453.40] etc if you scroll down to the bottom right, right dynamic of course we had to check it out on the x-ray
[8454.20 → 8461.48] dude this is so cool shout out Lima field for making it so easy for us to see the insides so happy
[8461.48 → 8467.64] they've let us hold on to that dude it's so cool absolute bros um but yeah to just keep going with
[8467.64 → 8472.20] Lucas's notes here labs investigated whether logical is really Bluetooth LE we'll check that
[8472.20 → 8477.56] out we're not going to talk anymore no I'm coming back to it or not and apple's new 40 watt dynamic
[8477.56 → 8483.64] power adapter for the 40 watt dynamic power adapter the new USB power adapter from apple which guarantees
[8483.64 → 8488.68] 40 watt output but will boost to 60 watts we tested how this will actually interact while
[8488.68 → 8495.00] uh your phone is charging iPhones charge below 40 watts anyway and some longer term tests to
[8495.00 → 8499.16] determine when it drops to 40 watts, and we're potentially going to test some stuff with it
[8499.16 → 8510.12] uh later on as well but if you go down even further uh keep going this graph is quite interesting so it's a
[8510.12 → 8514.12] little bit hard for me to read it from there maybe i should just bring it up myself, but you've got the
[8514.12 → 8522.28] output power and the input power of the actual unit the charger, and then we're thinking that, so time is
[8522.28 → 8528.52] your x and wattage is your y so we're thinking that it because it stays at 60 for quite a while at
[8528.52 → 8536.60] the beginning, and we think it's thermal so it's getting too hot going down to 40 cooling enough going
[8536.60 → 8542.60] back up to 60 and coming back down we think that's what's going on interesting but don't know
[8544.36 → 8549.32] duty cycle of roughly 66 percent after the initial warming up
[8551.56 → 8555.64] huh so on average about 50.33 watts
[8557.72 → 8561.72] this goes slightly against my theory of apple building a 60 watt charger that couldn't achieve
[8561.72 → 8568.84] their temperature limits 51 watts is quite far off of 60 watts uh if this is interesting to you, i suggest
[8568.84 → 8573.40] you check out uh all things one place who conducts power adapter testing regularly and made a video about
[8573.40 → 8581.96] the 40 watt dynamic charger very cool great article I also read the uh the bolt um logic bolt article it
[8581.96 → 8591.08] was awesome yeah basically that was uh like you know in a in a short circuit video we said it was
[8591.08 → 8596.52] just a Bluetooth dongle which is a downer people got mad so we were like all right well lets uh let's
[8596.52 → 8602.44] dive into this let's reach out to Logitech let's get information from them lets uh kind of pull some
[8602.44 → 8607.00] of our testing together and look into what this thing is and as it turns out from a performance
[8607.00 → 8612.04] standpoint it's just Bluetooth from a performance standpoint yeah which is there is a little bit more
[8612.04 → 8619.08] to it exactly why it was a bit of a downer, but also there is more to it and the community was right yes
[8619.08 → 8625.80] that um it does have advantages over just Bluetooth yeah check out the lab site we've
[8625.80 → 8631.72] we've been pushing a lot of articles lately um, and we want to keep doing this i think Lucas has been
[8632.28 → 8641.32] um taking the charge on a lot of these of like having a question of like what is this thing how does it
[8641.32 → 8646.84] work and then just deciding that you know what if we had that question probably someone else did too
[8646.84 → 8654.36] let's let's follow it up let's try to figure it out um also clearly like with the logical one
[8654.36 → 8660.84] um if is we get called out on something which might be fair like it was here we're going to try to dive
[8660.84 → 8666.04] into that and learn more as well this is a knowledge base expansion for us for our companies and
[8666.04 → 8672.68] hopefully for you guys as well so um this one's perfect too I've read this one why the AirPods Pro
[8672.68 → 8682.12] threes are a nightmare to test uh very interesting different frequency response uh at different
[8682.12 → 8687.96] volume levels i I had some people really mad about us saying that in the short circuit they were like
[8687.96 → 8697.96] no that's not how it works, but it does if the manufacturer tunes it to do that which is exactly why
[8697.96 → 8702.68] we were saying yeah it's kind of weird yeah we worked with griffin from the headphone show on that
[8702.68 → 8708.04] one um pretty cool yeah we're also trying to use this as like somewhat of a collaboration thing so we
[8708.04 → 8713.72] can like work with certain external experts and stuff UCR buffalo makes a perfect point
[8715.00 → 8723.40] tech link should be promoting new labs articles like primary source articles from the labs like why not it's news
[8723.40 → 8730.60] news duh seems kind of obvious to me, i never really thought about that yeah I never thought of it
[8730.60 → 8738.92] either that's cool like we have a new show yeah okay cool good chat um neat I want to talk about
[8739.80 → 8745.96] oh hold on let's do this really quick YouTuber cyber CPU has accused Microsoft of orchestrating YouTube's
[8745.96 → 8751.16] removal of some of his Windows 11 tutorials that enable users to install the OS on non-supported hardware and
[8751.16 → 8758.28] without an online connection for violating the platform's community guidelines after appealing the
[8758.28 → 8763.64] takedowns he received a vague answer as to why the videos had been removed from YouTube that said
[8763.64 → 8768.68] the warning strike you received was issued based on a violation of harmful or dangerous content which
[8768.68 → 8773.80] prohibits content that encourages or promotes behaviour that encourages dangerous or illegal activities
[8773.80 → 8781.40] that risk serious physical harm or death does bypass TPM 2.0 really pose a serious risk of
[8781.40 → 8790.60] physical harm or death no well it could if Microsoft is threatening to kill or harm you if you don't take
[8790.60 → 8796.84] them down very good very good um our discussion question here is why does Microsoft want to
[8796.84 → 8804.28] prevent people from using older computers with Windows 11 why do they care I don't know it's been a
[8804.28 → 8812.60] little strange to me too especially because it's like not that hard to bypass yeah so like yeah why
[8812.60 → 8817.08] specifically are YouTube videos getting taken down like it's not like you can't find these resources so
[8817.08 → 8825.32] can we just very easily can we just not like I'd that'd be that'd be cool good chat I want to talk about
[8825.32 → 8831.64] how um I want to point out one thing really quick i just I don't know I showed it out uh Lucas for
[8831.64 → 8836.44] coming up with cool articles and pursuing them and writing them and stuff and that has been great
[8836.44 → 8842.92] thank you Lucas I also want to say that this has been like a team effort from the lab so I didn't want
[8842.92 → 8849.88] to just single out only uh only Lucas it's been it's been cool I've been really enjoying that um and one of
[8849.88 → 8855.88] our like marching order things for a bit now and continuing forward has just been yeah if there's
[8855.88 → 8860.76] an interesting question follow it up so it's been I've appreciated that the whole team has embraced that
[8860.76 → 8866.60] professionally curious is exactly what we want in a department like that yeah uh okay I got one more
[8866.60 → 8877.88] quick one here AMD releases new zen 2 and zen 3 plus CPUs as dozen 10 and dozen 100 these new
[8877.88 → 8886.68] medicine CPUs based on zen 2 include the Athlon silver 10 which is a dual-core the Athlon gold 20
[8886.68 → 8895.80] which is also a dual-core although at least it has uh SMT uh the dozen 330 a quad-core and the dozen 540
[8895.80 → 8904.92] also a quad-core the new Rembrandt CPUs based on zen 3 plus are the dozen 3 110 the dozen 5 130 the dozen
[8904.92 → 8911.80] 5 150 dozen 7 you can't have a dozen 7 based on zen 3 plus now come on man
[8913.96 → 8920.44] dozen 7 170 8 cores up to 4.57 gigahertz what are they doing why do they need to do this can they
[8920.44 → 8925.88] just have the old can people can we just know it's an old CPU and then just buy an old CPU
[8925.88 → 8938.60] exhausting um I'm tired of it what I'm not tired of is driving Chinese EVS oh I don't know if you saw
[8938.60 → 8947.32] this prime minister mark carney Canada's relationship with china is at a turning point control f hold on oh no
[8947.32 → 8954.60] hold on hold on
[8958.36 → 8959.40] hold on where is it
[8961.56 → 8969.08] here we go here we go here we go they discussed hold on this is not oh yeah okay they discussed
[8969.08 → 8976.12] solutions to respective sensitivities regarding issues including agriculture and agri-food products
[8976.12 → 8983.88] such as canola as well as seafood and electric vehicles according to the readout so I don't know
[8983.88 → 8992.44] if folks know this but last one in lockstep with the US Canada introduced 100 tariffs on Chinese EVS a
[8992.44 → 8998.28] number of years ago which has made it basically impossible for Chinese EV makers to import their
[8998.28 → 9004.36] vehicles into Canada there's been a couple of exceptions infant tried to kind of launch here
[9004.36 → 9010.28] and I think I've seen like two on the road but um have not had a ton of success because with a 100
[9010.84 → 9018.76] tariff um it's pretty hard to ship over here and I don't think infant set up manufacturing here in any
[9018.76 → 9027.32] capacity and fast manufacturing in Canada I don't think they did so they do not have a
[9027.32 → 9034.76] a very uh yeah no they have no manufacturing in Canada Chinese oh are they Vietnamese yeah
[9034.76 → 9040.60] oh they are there you go okay so sorry sorry sorry VIN fast max you guys are a very relevant brand
[9040.60 → 9045.56] um and I would care a lot about where you were from um I'm sorry
[9047.48 → 9052.12] anyway what I really want to talk about today is oh shoot do I have
[9052.12 → 9061.72] oh I have it oh I have it I was over in China recently and uh I did get a couple of opportunities
[9061.72 → 9070.92] to chill in a Chinese EV, and you know how ford CEO has gone on the record a number of times
[9070.92 → 9077.00] at this point basically saying hey if the North American auto industry doesn't get its act together
[9077.00 → 9084.04] like we're we're cooked boys yeah i i I don't I don't I don't know if there's going to be
[9084.04 → 9090.36] an opportunity to get their act together it's just holding them out with tariffs that's effectively all
[9090.36 → 9100.28] it is now i i think the corkage is um is basically a foregone conclusion at this point man i
[9100.28 → 9106.68] rode in the car while I was over there that is going to absolutely blow your mind when i finally
[9106.68 → 9113.00] find up the bloody picture of it and uh we get it up on screen here sorry, sorry my sincere
[9113.00 → 9117.64] apologies I don't know what is going on did I take it on the did I take it on the iPhone I don't think i
[9117.64 → 9127.88] did I quickly stall for time do a merge message or something I'm sorry sure everything thank you
[9128.60 → 9134.44] uh let's see what I can find here look this might be useful for you hi DLL what's the worst case of we
[9134.44 → 9142.36] don't need a pro you've seen I was helping run Wi-Fi for a festival 35 000 attendees with 80 unify apps
[9142.36 → 9150.04] a marketing guy suggested replacing the system with starlings what nice um
[9152.20 → 9159.40] the worst case of we don't need a pro and I'm sure you've seen some here oh yeah our entire company oh
[9159.40 → 9165.64] we can do that we that's fine we reinvent a lot of wheels brethren let's just hire a recent graduate
[9165.64 → 9171.96] should be fine we'll figure it out uh we do, and it's way it's way better for the content to figure
[9171.96 → 9180.76] it out as we go yeah yeah um no I'm not a convenient store robber I'm duke from the season
[9180.76 → 9187.08] before the last season of scrapyard wars that's pretty good too though it's not bad um I don't know
[9187.08 → 9196.04] there's a ton of examples of that it like here I mean we don't need a pro uh this is I'm I'm
[9196.04 → 9201.24] slightly copping out by saying we can just do this ourselves instead of using external service
[9201.80 → 9207.80] so a series of professionals maybe I was going to say nice like oh we can do that that was crazy that's
[9207.80 → 9214.04] stupid that's probably one of the most brutal ones we've ever done yeah I mean we did if it's working
[9214.04 → 9221.48] it's but like my goodness it literally is like a multi-million dollar a year success
[9222.44 → 9228.28] multi-platform at this point yeah like it's working it's just it powers us sauce plus a lot of other
[9228.28 → 9235.24] creators on float plane like I don't know man i it kind we kind of you know yeah yeah you kind of did it
[9235.24 → 9240.84] it has cool future plans the team's kind of amazing whatnot, and we're figuring it out it also forced us to
[9240.84 → 9245.56] finally have a dev team yeah which is cool who has done all kinds of other cool stuff
[9246.84 → 9252.68] like I don't know sometimes I really like working on full plane stuff our whole like I just do feels
[9252.68 → 9259.00] like home I feel like we kind of fail upward a lot you know you know what I mean right like
[9259.56 → 9265.08] not in the way that normally is meant right like failing upwards is when you're like incompetent and
[9265.08 → 9270.44] you get kind of pushed out but into like a higher position like kind of like a nepotism sort of
[9270.44 → 9278.12] connotation like we but we've just managed to screw up our way to the top but like it actually
[9278.12 → 9285.24] worked like it didn't fail yeah, but it should have yeah it was just way harder than it needed to be that
[9285.24 → 9291.24] was most of it decision-making failure I had a yeah I had a lot of conversations with people where
[9291.24 → 9297.08] it would start as like you shouldn't do this because you can't, and then it would end up being
[9297.08 → 9306.20] like okay fine you can but like why yeah I didn't listen to that part yeah I just listened to the
[9306.20 → 9318.52] can't yeah no we can't uh oh well um yeah did you figure your thing out yeah, yeah damn
[9321.16 → 9328.52] I rode okay no wait not yet so I rode in a couple of cars so one of them was part of the Huawei demo at
[9328.52 → 9335.00] their like flagship store which includes everything if I was asked to design a store to showcase everything
[9335.00 → 9340.20] from like wearables to TVs to automobiles I wouldn't even know where to start but honestly
[9340.20 → 9345.24] they kind of nailed it so they had some cars that had like partner technologies in their showroom
[9345.24 → 9352.60] so we went a test drive in one, and it's got you know voice activation this and uh assisted driving
[9352.60 → 9361.48] whatever that and like you know it's like kind of cool um but this one the one that they used to drive
[9361.48 → 9366.28] us between the locations where they were just like showing off Huawei technology integrations and
[9366.28 → 9376.44] vehicles absolutely blew my mind and I agree with ford CEO um we're cooked over here we're cooked check
[9376.44 → 9383.64] this out first one yeah, so this is me and charade in the back of a whatever this is I actually can't
[9383.64 → 9390.60] remember what the model name is so that's embarrassing um we have a starry night sky thing above us sure um
[9391.48 → 9399.40] in the next two oh uh by charade's elbow okay so you can see all the seat adjustments in there
[9399.88 → 9408.12] and then right next to that each seat has a little like pop-out phone like device that you can use to
[9408.12 → 9416.04] control the various functions in the car including the heating cooling of your seat um the heat the
[9416.04 → 9421.88] temperature of the fridge that's between us, so there's a there's a little like fridge that could
[9421.88 → 9427.88] hold maybe like a wine bottle or a couple of other drinks in between us where that that like Kleenex thing
[9427.88 → 9439.00] is um okay now are you a little impressed uh yeah, but it just looks like an expensive back of a car
[9439.00 → 9447.96] all right hit him with the next one wow so you could mod that in, but that's that's uh
[9449.00 → 9459.24] it's very pimp my ride so in between our heads is a projector, and you press a button that lowers
[9459.24 → 9467.32] a projector screen yeah the windows uh what's it called electro chromatic legroom is this a really
[9467.32 → 9473.08] long car it's its it's meant to be it's its the kind of car you're meant to be passenger vehicle
[9473.08 → 9477.48] for it in or whatever those called yeah, yeah so it's its kind of competing with like you know the
[9477.48 → 9485.40] the roles the Maybach um exactly and um okay sorry what was I saying oh right right right so the
[9485.40 → 9492.20] so the projector screen comes down there is a camera you can see there's a webcam up at the top of the
[9492.20 → 9498.44] projector screen so you can like to take a conference call it's good uh look I mean sure but also you
[9498.44 → 9504.84] know so you can take a conference call you know um and have all the other all the other meeting
[9504.84 → 9511.96] attendees on the projector screen yeah the windows are uh I believe they are what's it called uh
[9511.96 → 9518.28] electro chromatic electrochromic yeah, and they have like a filter that that comes up so
[9518.28 → 9523.64] they have like a sunshade that comes up to make it actually quite dark in the back uh there's
[9523.64 → 9528.84] wireless charging in between our in the armrest there's two little slips where you can slip your
[9528.84 → 9534.60] phone into right by that piece of paper nice I see that uh charade was joking really all these features
[9534.60 → 9541.00] and no cupholder retractable cupholder that's um under where the charging is so you kind of hit a
[9541.00 → 9547.56] button, and then it pops out in between us the seats fully recline and adjust oh they have message
[9547.56 → 9553.56] in addition to heat and cooling and one of the really wild features okay you can go back to uh
[9553.56 → 9560.36] you can go back to us is it includes a privacy mode so that the passengers in the front can't hear you or
[9560.36 → 9565.88] the front passenger and the driver can't hear you, and we were like okay well that's stupid there's no way
[9565.88 → 9571.40] that works um and then charade pressed it, and it turns out that it doesn't just try to like ANC
[9571.40 → 9578.20] what you're saying because that would be we don't have that technology yet um what it does is it
[9579.40 → 9587.48] adds like an echo loop and a bunch of sorts of noise it is like it's it sort of salts the data so to
[9587.48 → 9595.40] speak um while probably also doing the ANC stuff yeah yeah yeah um I didn't actually try sitting in the
[9595.40 → 9601.80] front unfortunately I didn't really get a chance but pretty, pretty wild now was it this thing
[9603.32 → 9607.88] oh yeah that's it yeah, yeah so Nokia found it hold on hold on don't look too
[9607.88 → 9613.64] don't look too closely yet I want you to okay I want you to guess I want you to guess what it costs
[9613.64 → 9619.48] it's oh I stopped it from being there, but it's still on my screen uh hold on okay first of all
[9619.48 → 9627.72] all so like what does uh what does this roll z like what's a ghost cost okay i 400k is my guess
[9628.76 → 9636.60] uh 600k yeah if you don't if you don't customize anything the options blah blah currency are we
[9636.60 → 9642.92] talking commission you don't buy you don't buy a ghost you commission a ghost so I actually don't
[9642.92 → 9649.80] remember how much they cost oh yes uh do they have done they even have a starting price for crying out
[9649.80 → 9655.32] loud make an inquiry okay forget it the point is probably about half a million dollars by the time
[9655.32 → 9660.92] you actually like do anything is the ghost the expensive one I don't even think that's their top
[9660.92 → 9666.20] of the line though that's like their that's like their kind of their workhorse is my understanding i
[9666.20 → 9672.76] don't I don't know their lineup extremely well I've never bought a roll sorry uh
[9672.76 → 9680.92] uh the lowest possible is like 355 okay from what I'm seeing, but it can go a lot higher is the phantom
[9680.92 → 9687.40] their starter I actually can't remember the peasant spying ghost yeah I'm actually not sure I think the
[9687.40 → 9695.80] Sullivan is higher end that's the SUV right yeah uh I don't know what the spectre is yeah I can't
[9695.80 → 9705.00] remember okay anyway how much do you think the mike strop costs 80k
[9707.40 → 9715.32] okay why did you why would you guess that I don't know uh I didn't look it up I don't I'm assuming I'm
[9715.32 → 9720.28] not correct no you're not right but yeah I'm just wondering why you would guess 80 000 like what
[9720.28 → 9727.64] else could you buy for 80 000 it's its like cheaper than the high-end teslas but more expensive
[9727.64 → 9734.20] than like I don't know other stuff starts at about 100k okay uh, but we're still
[9736.12 → 9742.92] it's an EV so it comes with like batteries which are a cost that you know a gasoline competitor
[9742.92 → 9749.16] doesn't have to deal with yep um so you never have to put gas in if it is
[9750.84 → 9756.68] like you're sitting on a couch basically in the back of if it's crazy I did I think I told you uh
[9756.68 → 9763.48] when I was in China I got chauffeured around one time in the back of a Maybach and I had the same
[9763.48 → 9770.60] feeling I sat in that chair and was just like what the heck it's weird it feels uh almost uncanny it's
[9770.60 → 9781.56] like this isn't a car what am I in right now so the price range is 100 to 140 for this and look I'll
[9781.56 → 9787.08] be honest with you guys I've never even sat in a ghost I've never I've never sat in a Rolls-Royce
[9787.64 → 9794.12] but to my ignorant you know unrefined buttock yes um
[9794.12 → 9799.88] I'm I'm looking at this I'm looking at this thing going
[9801.80 → 9807.88] how is it realistically going to get way beyond yeah this thing yeah like this would be this would
[9807.88 → 9813.00] be the pinnacle of luxury to most some of these pictures are nuts yeah here let's see
[9816.28 → 9822.60] this is the uh the mike strew or whatever yeah I mean you can just zoom your browser just to give it
[9822.60 → 9831.72] the old two finger you know what I'm saying oh yeah did I oh yeah did I mention the starry sky in
[9831.72 → 9838.76] it can have like different modes it can twinkle it can do shooting stars um the starry sky feels like a
[9838.76 → 9848.76] rip bit of a rip huge screens it's something that people do in rolls as though that's why that's
[9848.76 → 9855.88] what I'm saying I think it's a rip oh a rip-off oh 100 oh 100 are those speakers in the yeah those
[9855.88 → 9861.72] speakers in the chair why not like it's its loaded for bear man
[9864.44 → 9864.76] wow
[9867.48 → 9873.24] is this like the seat in front of them is gone oh no it folds down yeah okay
[9873.24 → 9880.12] that's why so you can get extremely comfy is this is someone's phone or is this the
[9880.12 → 9882.76] tablet thing you're talking that's the little tablet controller thing yeah
[9884.60 → 9890.84] it's pretty wild dude oh yeah it has the airplane table uh fold out thing I forgot about that no, no on
[9890.84 → 9896.76] the left oh yeah, yeah so you have a little table at both of the back seats laptop or whatever yep or you
[9896.76 → 9902.68] can eat or your swishy trunk yep trunk
[9907.00 → 9907.72] what is this
[9910.44 → 9912.36] I think they're trying to show matrix headlamps
[9915.56 → 9916.60] no I don't think so
[9920.52 → 9921.00] interesting
[9924.36 → 9924.60] yeah
[9926.76 → 9928.60] huh
[9928.60 → 9931.96] uh it's available in multiple options' oh okay yep
[9933.72 → 9942.68] all right anyway very interesting yeah it's uh i I had i I had been you know reading about
[9942.68 → 9951.48] following from a distance so that or a cyber truck right like seriously though yeah i I don't think that
[9951.48 → 9957.00] would make an insane splash I don't think that would make as insane of a splash in the north
[9957.00 → 9963.88] American market that people might think um they're going to need a good truck oh yeah apparently BYD's
[9963.88 → 9969.88] truck is like 35k or something like that um see like that might make a bigger splash because you've
[9969.88 → 9974.92] you got to fight the f-150 there's no like there's no ignoring the f-150 and trying to enter
[9974.92 → 9977.00] the North American market heck no so
[9978.12 → 9982.68] yeah and that's still going to be it's BYD so I'm assuming that's an electric truck still
[9983.16 → 9990.04] uh I think it's a hybrid yeah it's its no good 63 says their Ford Ranger size pickup with a one
[9990.04 → 9995.08] cylinder allows up to 500 miles of range and is 35 000 us dollars
[9995.08 → 10002.52] yeah um see that'll be that's a more interesting fight in my opinion yep um opcode says how does it
[10002.52 → 10010.04] compare to your take hand in terms of quality it's a very different car um like it's not it's not
[10010.04 → 10017.88] intended to compete with the Taiwan loading couch yeah um whisks you from location to location the Taiwan
[10017.88 → 10024.84] is meant to be driven whereas the mike SRO is intended to be driven around in right so it's
[10024.84 → 10031.88] it's totally different the maestro's a snuggle and the Taiwan's like a running shoe yeah um terrible
[10031.88 → 10037.32] analogies in terms of like the fit and finish of it though I'll be honest with you, I didn't look
[10037.32 → 10043.40] that closely because I was too busy being impressed by the sum of the parts rather than the individual
[10043.40 → 10047.64] parts sure um if we were doing like a full review or something like that that would be a different
[10047.64 → 10054.76] story but nothing stood out to me as being junky I can tell you that much for sure um oh shoot i
[10054.76 → 10059.16] have to go pretty quick because I have to take my kids um surprised you're still here uh trick-or-treating
[10059.16 → 10063.56] no, no I'm I'm good are we done the topics we're done the topics we're done the topics we haven't
[10063.56 → 10071.80] done SP announcement merch massages our most successful float plane video ever was when leg employees shared
[10071.80 → 10082.28] their first memories of meeting me oh wow yep that's a pretty strong like dislike ratio um so we made a
[10082.28 → 10090.84] sequel featuring Yvonne Colton and proof who owns a display and more oh and yes there will be a video
[10090.84 → 10095.08] of me reacting to the sequel in November oh good I haven't done that yet but apparently we're going to be
[10095.08 → 10103.16] doing that so get some laughs and maybe a little bit of secondhand embarrassment at leg.GG float plane
[10103.16 → 10108.20] excellent all right Dan should we do a couple merch messages yeah that sounds good to me hit me sure
[10108.20 → 10117.96] uh let's see why does it seem like every tech tuber praises the 9070-9070 XT on camera and fsr4 yada
[10117.96 → 10125.88] but off camera they're all running NVIDIA GPUs feels like a bit of do as I say not as I do i I'm
[10125.88 → 10133.72] running a 7900 ATX let the record show so I don't know in my opinion when praise is happening their
[10133.72 → 10138.60] often probably talking about price performance, and then they can have whatever they want so they take
[10138.60 → 10144.28] the performance and do not care about the price that's the answer that's that's the real answer
[10144.28 → 10151.24] the only reason I'm running a 7900 ATX is that I committed to skipping the 40 series
[10153.24 → 10161.88] and otherwise I would have just run a 4090. Greetings DLL Linus with the Canadian post strike
[10161.88 → 10167.48] why does creator warehouse still ship to PO boxes when the Ltd store site says to avoid them I use my
[10167.48 → 10175.48] street address, but the merch still comes Canada post wow what a tremendous question for creator
[10175.48 → 10181.88] warehouse customer service i I think you should send them a message, and maybe they can explain that
[10181.88 → 10190.36] I have no idea I want to shout out our amazing CW team uh tony and Dave and Adam and the rest of the
[10190.36 → 10197.56] customer care team and Taryn and everyone who has worked really hard on you know resolving the
[10197.56 → 10202.36] challenging logistics situation that has taken place this year we've had to deal with tariffs
[10202.36 → 10207.64] from our southern neighbours we've had to deal with tariffs from our manufacturing neighbours we've had
[10207.64 → 10212.44] to deal with flipping the strike from Canada post we've had a lot of times I think we've had a lot of
[10212.44 → 10218.44] on our plate this year and our team has done an amazing job of figuring out how to get your thing to
[10218.44 → 10222.52] you and shout out them and if you want the specifics you'll have to ask them because they're the experts
[10224.60 → 10230.76] what an answer good answer I've been doing this for a little bit professional what a guy this one i
[10230.76 → 10237.48] wasn't too sure about maybe you could help me parse it started a re photo comp with a few family members
[10237.48 → 10244.04] and have hit 30 in revenue, and we are trying to learn to scale fast and trying to figure out the best
[10244.04 → 10253.48] route such as pacing ourselves or just spamming the phone thanks a photo comp photo competition
[10254.52 → 10264.12] few family members re I'm not sure 30 in rev 30k I'm assuming so maybe they're hosting a competition
[10264.12 → 10268.60] maybe you have to pay to enter the competition spamming the phone that I don't know
[10268.60 → 10278.20] okay nobody else understands what they're talking about what is re photo comp started a re photo comp
[10283.32 → 10290.52] next okay yeah sorry I was struggling genuinely tried hey DLL question for Linus how's the new winter
[10290.52 → 10299.48] jacket coming along real estate photo company oh, oh my god i real estate no, no no, no no, no imperator
[10299.48 → 10304.36] in full plane chat said real estate that makes so much more sense real estate photo company they hit 30
[10304.36 → 10309.32] k in revenue they something or just spamming photos on a phone what was the other thing they
[10309.32 → 10314.20] were saying hitting the phone I think they were looking how to scale fast right they wanted to scale up
[10314.20 → 10319.40] and they weren't sure how to do that without just like hitting the phone which is probably more like
[10319.40 → 10326.36] cold calling pacing ourselves or just spamming the phone spamming the phone cold calling he's probably
[10326.36 → 10332.68] right my yeah this is uh yeah I mean it's going to be all networking in that industry like it's all old
[10332.68 → 10339.32] boys club so to speak um so you definitely want to make connections and everything else is kind of
[10339.32 → 10343.16] secondary honestly as someone who's looked through real estate listings
[10345.56 → 10352.44] man are most their photos terrible yeah learn how to do HDR better than like 90 of everybody and
[10352.44 → 10357.56] you're fine there's some actually perfect it's not a high bar there is a lot of perfect YouTube
[10357.56 → 10362.92] tutorials but if you've already got 30k in revenue you're fine you know what you're doing yeah keep it up
[10362.92 → 10371.00] congrats on on on growing it at a staging company keep it up yeah staging is making such a big difference
[10371.00 → 10376.60] or do um okay so yeah probably, but a bunch of people are doing uh people aren't going to like this
[10376.60 → 10383.08] but like uh AI staging stuff lately it is actually very surprisingly good because you can see the photo
[10383.08 → 10389.00] of the room empty and the photo of the room with stuff in it, and it's cool being able to see that idea
[10389.00 → 10399.08] um new winter jacket uh oh okay you'll have to do another one while I look that up um
[10402.20 → 10407.80] hi Wanda DL are you aware of the development of 3d printed medication and the potential for
[10407.80 → 10412.76] multiple prescriptions to be combined into one pill and do you have thoughts about it that's cool i
[10412.76 → 10418.04] haven't heard of that how does that make any sense why would you 3d print them yeah well maybe because
[10418.04 → 10422.36] you want like different release schedules or whatever because like you know they can have
[10422.36 → 10426.28] different coatings, and they can have different like capsules and stuff that release at different
[10426.28 → 10432.12] times but why would you want to 3d print that I don't know maybe it's more maybe it's like helps
[10432.12 → 10438.04] that the complexity how do you ensure they're mixed properly I don't know I don't know I'm not a
[10438.04 → 10446.20] doctor I'm just saying I like 3d printing hmm don't wait really someone needs to clip that we need to
[10446.20 → 10449.72] clip that Dan we need that clip he knows what I mean
[10453.88 → 10461.96] I was in a couple time stamps uh thermochromic jacket is expected to hit in November
[10463.48 → 10469.80] so soon but I don't want to nail down an exact week because things sometimes happen nice, but that's
[10469.80 → 10478.28] when it's expected hi LLD looking for advice moving to rural Australia for work in the next 25 52 weeks
[10478.76 → 10486.12] uh steam deck versus Xbox ally versus laptop reviews seem to indicate ally x is undercooked my friends
[10486.12 → 10496.60] use Xbox online oh I mean, but these are all pcs the steam deck with Xbox online question mark cross play
[10496.60 → 10505.48] um I mean the laptop if you can only have one the laptop has the most utility if you can get one that
[10505.48 → 10510.52] supports an oh I don't think this one supports it but like a tent mode you know where it folds the
[10510.52 → 10516.60] other way, and you can just put it like this but with the screen on the outside it's very nice on a thing
[10516.60 → 10521.48] with a controller that's pretty sick like if you can only have one I'd want the one that has a keyboard
[10521.48 → 10526.68] um I'm also personally leaning laptop but i I didn't answer right away because I don't have either
[10526.68 → 10535.64] of the other ones so I'm a little bit biased here um yeah and I don't know how much like a strip halo
[10535.64 → 10542.84] laptop costs this hp1 my understanding is its pretty, pretty expensive
[10542.84 → 10553.24] it is true like the steam deck is going to be by far the cheapest option like one of the issues
[10553.24 → 10559.88] with this question is you're asking an insane variety in price yeah i I mean the steam deck is
[10559.88 → 10565.72] the best bang for the buck that's the easiest one to recommend but as for the ally Xbox ally x whatever
[10565.72 → 10571.00] whatever the stupid thing is called so do you need to do more stuff on it it's its it's its pretty
[10571.00 → 10577.56] good like i I don't know what to tell you it's um I think people are just frustrated because Microsoft
[10577.56 → 10584.20] sold it as something that it wasn't but as a small computer that's pretty d's it's great yeah
[10585.40 → 10592.20] that's not less a question but maybe more of a general question my work has a stupid new no graphic
[10592.20 → 10598.28] tease policy, but text isn't banned please make a shirt that says shirt in giant text on it
[10598.28 → 10604.84] how does that fit in with like your branding or your like is that something that you would ever do
[10604.84 → 10609.32] or do you want to make like cool stuff because like shirt that says shirt and giant
[10609.88 → 10613.96] text is like kind of my aesthetic in a way I love that type of stuff
[10617.88 → 10621.48] I've been pondering I mean do enough of you want this like is that a thing
[10621.48 → 10628.84] I figured yeah can you make ASCII images that's just text see that that sort of tickles my malicious
[10628.84 → 10633.40] compliance, but that's fantastic a lot more than the other one does it kind of made me think of uh
[10633.40 → 10638.36] the no-name brand like merch products that they do I'll tell you what we'll do the ASCII one
[10638.84 → 10644.44] ASCII that's a way better idea I like an ASCII art shirt oh yeah, thanks Maria that sounds like a great
[10644.44 → 10650.92] okay uh um who do I send this to okay I'll the next time we do a Linux challenge we should both be required
[10650.92 → 10661.16] to uh make a cool little you know can I use the term
[10663.40 → 10667.32] to rice it out in a really cool way that is the official term that is what people call it I'm just
[10667.32 → 10673.40] saying sure we'll go with that and there is cool stuff that they do with ASCII art in that process
[10673.40 → 10679.80] and we should do that that should be part of it whatever leave me alone I don't know what
[10679.80 → 10687.80] else to call it modify yeah, but that doesn't have that's not that doesn't encapsulate the that's true
[10687.80 → 10694.04] whatever you've been waiting for a turn yeah um I have been waiting so long for this to
[10694.04 → 10700.60] come back they have bought the northern lights t-shirt tall hell yeah, thank you for doing tall
[10700.60 → 10705.56] graphics is this our first tall graphic it seems to be, and it's like five of them or something it's
[10705.56 → 10711.72] actually very exciting I need to order them immediately yeah me too I've been waiting so
[10711.72 → 10716.92] long for this to come back what is the oldest used hardware you'd recommend picking up right now
[10717.88 → 10723.80] oh man it depends on what you're trying to do I mean i it's so open-ended yeah i i i my uncle
[10723.80 → 10735.16] needed a laptop with a CD-ROM drive in it and so uh we just grabbed some like vista machine
[10735.56 → 10741.24] and it will never be connected to a network so it doesn't matter because it's for like loading
[10741.88 → 10749.16] data from some CD resource into some computer, and it has to like to live there because it has to be used
[10749.16 → 10754.60] periodically and connected to that thing, and it's just like well that's the oldest hardware that I'd
[10754.60 → 10759.88] recommend for that like it is just depends on what you're trying to do running a Windows XP machine
[10759.88 → 10764.68] today if it was completely offline it's totally fine tons of them still work that way in terms of
[10764.68 → 10768.28] workshops and stuff what I would actually connect to the internet I would want something that is
[10768.28 → 10772.52] modern enough to run an operating system that's still getting updates if it's windows that means
[10772.52 → 10783.00] not that old but if it's Linux go ham nice dynast duke and LAN do sponsors pay extra for Riley to do
[10783.00 → 10786.92] his amazing singing ad spots or does he do them just because he can yes
[10786.92 → 10795.80] both of those things uh he's kind of uh been a bit of a spiritual successor for what Dennis was doing
[10795.80 → 10802.52] with what we call CSPS or creative sponsor placements or something like that I forget what it's short for
[10802.52 → 10809.24] but um it was CSR, so creative sponsor reads but then I was like that sounds too close to customer service
[10809.24 → 10812.36] representative and I'm never going to know what you're talking about so we changed it to CSP
[10812.36 → 10819.00] and um it is something that sponsors can pay extra for, and we do show them hey there's increased
[10819.00 → 10824.84] retention there's increased um click through like there's all these benefits you should probably do
[10824.84 → 10831.08] this I have had two merch messages this evening asking for a compilation i I could see that being
[10831.08 → 10837.72] something we might do on the clips channel at some point but yeah I know he's been killing it um
[10838.28 → 10846.28] cannot say enough how impressed I have been with Riley's work on that I am dude it's not just Riley
[10846.28 → 10851.40] it's a team effort it's not just Riley they have to be they have to be shot and edited and stuff but
[10851.40 → 10859.16] like massive shout out to the team yeah so it's been nuts yeah last one I got for you today good
[10859.16 → 10864.52] evening Linus Luke and Dan what wireless technology do you think might compete or replace Bluetooth do you
[10864.52 → 10871.72] think RF headphones would ever make a comeback what happened to Wi-Fi oh I don't know man I mean
[10871.72 → 10877.32] there's only so much spectrum like it's one of those things where it's like man what new continents
[10877.32 → 10882.92] do you think we could discover you know over the last thousand years we've just western civilization
[10882.92 → 10890.12] has discovered a continent at approximately a rate of one every 200 years you know well like yeah okay
[10890.12 → 10901.24] but there's um here's a really controversial take sure modern bile pretty good yeah there's more that
[10901.24 → 10907.56] could be done for user-friendliness but like even then why can't I have multichannel with good audio
[10907.56 → 10915.72] and a mic at the same time in current year I am upset I agree with that do better, but it's still
[10915.72 → 10921.32] Bluetooth you could just make Bluetooth less garbage yeah, and they are dual stream like Bluetooth is
[10921.32 → 10927.72] continuing to get bettered and I mean as far as I can tell the major constraint is just that we
[10927.72 → 10934.92] all want it to be cheap yeah if you could do 2.4 gigahertz communication expensively well it would be
[10934.92 → 10940.60] better look at all the 2.4 gigahertz dongles that exist that are like better than Bluetooth, but we want it
[10940.60 → 10946.36] to be low power we want it to be cheap, and we want it to have good range, and we wanted to have
[10946.92 → 10952.52] a wide data path, and we wanted to have all these things, and it's like well look in the real world
[10952.52 → 10960.44] you don't get everything so wait I think it I think it will continue to get better as for Wi-Fi
[10960.44 → 10964.28] that's a good question I would love to know what happened to Wi-Fi and I was lying there's one more
[10964.28 → 10969.24] Linus you mentioned you still occasionally play Halo Infinite do you prefer 4v4 modes or big team battle
[10969.24 → 10975.80] halo isn't haloed to me without vehicles and at least eight versus eight I generally play 4v4 i um
[10975.80 → 10979.40] I find big team battle a little too chaotic for my boomer brain
[10981.64 → 10984.76] and so sorry my apologies
[10984.76 → 10997.64] thanks for tuning into the land show we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[10998.52 → 11003.32] I would have just stayed there i I know I would have waited I know i have to go through he gave up early
[11003.32 → 11013.88] oh yeah bye
[11017.72 → 11029.88] who knows
