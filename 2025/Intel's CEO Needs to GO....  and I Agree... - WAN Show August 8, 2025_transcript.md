[0.00 --> 10.58]  Dan?
[16.58 --> 17.64]  What's up everyone?
[17.84 --> 18.68]  And oh welcome
[18.68 --> 20.36]  to the WAN show.
[20.48 --> 22.04]  Now, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[22.14 --> 24.74]  Hold on, slow down, slow down the phone there.
[26.54 --> 28.20]  The President of the United States
[28.20 --> 35.82]  has called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lit Bhutan as a big fan of Pat Gelsinger,
[36.36 --> 43.14]  at least a fan of Gelsinger's vision for Intel, which admittedly did involve losing a lot of
[43.14 --> 51.28]  money over a period of time to kind of rebuild their manufacturing competitiveness. I, um,
[51.28 --> 60.26]  um, what can I say? I kind of agree. Lit Bhutan's vision appears to be to gut the workforce and
[60.26 --> 65.50]  part out the company piece by piece, which I'm having a real hard time, um, getting aligned with.
[65.64 --> 73.82]  So for completely different reasons, we seem to, we seem to agree. Um, what else we got?
[74.50 --> 81.24]  Ooh, it's been a big week in AI. We're going to be talking about GPT-5,
[81.60 --> 86.24]  Oh my God. There's so much this week. That's right. Genie three. Uh, also,
[86.44 --> 93.16]  also Elon Musk says that X is going to put ads in Grok's chatbot answers, meaning that advertisers
[93.16 --> 99.08]  could pay to have their product be the ideal solution that Grok suggests. Wow. We, we,
[99.08 --> 103.54]  we skipped the part where the product was free, but good. And we went straight to the
[103.54 --> 110.54]  institution. Okay. Move fast and break everything, right? Good job. Silicon Valley. What else we got?
[110.54 --> 115.60]  Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of good job, Silicon Valley, except they're not in Silicon Valley. Microsoft
[115.60 --> 122.32]  thinks that we'll throw away our keyboards by 2030, uh, because I don't know, uh, they're dumb. Uh,
[122.32 --> 128.92]  also Google claims that AI isn't killing website clicks, but, uh, I don't know. Maybe they think
[128.92 --> 133.60]  that cause they're dumb. We'll see what's with you and everything being dumb this week.
[134.64 --> 137.60]  This is like clearly stupid takes, but whatever.
[137.60 --> 161.84]  The show is brought to you today by Odoo, Proton and Vessi, along with, of course, our wrap partner,
[161.84 --> 168.60]  D brand, our Dell partner, laptop brand, our laptop partner, Dell brand, good Lord. And our chair
[168.60 --> 172.64]  partner, secret lab. Look, I'm on vacation this week. I'm not even supposed to be here.
[175.52 --> 183.48]  Why don't we jump right into our headline topic, which is of course that Lip Boutan appears to be
[183.48 --> 192.76]  wrecking Intel. Um, hold on a second. Why am I not able to find this topic in the doc?
[193.86 --> 194.88]  Yeah. Where did it go?
[194.96 --> 200.72]  Did I pick a headline topic and then not? Oh yeah, no, I found it. Cool. Okay. So it's actually
[200.72 --> 208.72]  combined with another topic. Computers may get more expensive due to 100% tariffs being promised
[208.72 --> 218.12]  on semiconductors and chips. Also Intel's new CEO is highly conflicted according to, uh, six time
[218.12 --> 224.80]  senior golf winner and president Donald Trump, who took a break from golfing to, uh, talk about all of
[224.80 --> 229.94]  this. So first of all, he announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on all semiconductors and chips
[229.94 --> 237.14]  unless the companies make commitments to build in the United States. At this point, it's not clear
[237.14 --> 242.80]  a hundred percent how much manufacturing needs to be done on U S soil for it to count as building in
[242.80 --> 249.60]  America. Um, it's also not clear if these things ever have to actually happen. Uh, was it, was it
[249.60 --> 256.34]  Foxconn back in the day during the first administration that broke ground on that, that factory that then just
[256.34 --> 264.04]  disappeared and was like a huge mystery? Might be right. But I mean, the, the biggest example of
[264.04 --> 268.18]  this, in my opinion, is the American telecom thing where they're like, everyone's going to get fiber.
[268.44 --> 274.12]  We're going to spend billions of dollars on this. And then just nothing happened. Um, was it, was it
[274.12 --> 281.12]  Foxconn you guys? I don't remember who it was. Yeah. The, the, the Foxconn sells to, sells former
[281.12 --> 289.26]  factory to mystery buyer. Uh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Apparently it was, it was Foxconn. Uh, Foxconn
[289.26 --> 298.20]  mostly abandons a $10 billion, uh, Wisconsin project. This is from April, 2021. Uh, so it's
[298.20 --> 304.66]  unclear to me how much of the, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars or whatever that these
[304.66 --> 311.74]  companies commit is actually contractually obligated to ever take place. Like that, that Foxconn one was
[311.74 --> 317.06]  super weird. I forget who it was. I forget if it was the verge or WAPO or someone basically kind of
[317.06 --> 325.54]  like went around and found the people who legitimately like seemed to work for Foxconn in Wisconsin. And
[325.54 --> 332.16]  they like wouldn't talk to anybody. And it was super weird. And they had these buildings they were
[332.16 --> 337.50]  leasing, but like you could look in them and there didn't seem to be anybody in there. And like
[337.50 --> 346.48]  the whole thing was super, super weird, like super weird. Uh, toaster pilot says the plan was literally
[346.48 --> 351.22]  written on a napkin. Yeah. I don't know. There was a, there was a photo op and they broke ground. And
[351.22 --> 360.64]  then the whole thing just seems to have kind of disappeared. Um, any who, if a company is either
[360.64 --> 365.52]  building currently or making a commitment to build in America, there will apparently be no tariff and
[365.52 --> 371.80]  whether or not you have to actually follow through on these commitments, TBD apparently. Um, that same
[371.80 --> 378.54]  day, uh, Donald demanded that the immediate resignation of Intel CEO, Lipboot Tan calling him
[378.54 --> 387.32]  highly conflicted due to his ties to Chinese firms. Uh, since back in April, Tan invested about 200
[387.32 --> 392.86]  million in hundreds of Chinese chip manufacturing, uh, firms, some being tied to the Chinese military.
[393.02 --> 397.32]  Tan has not made a comment or spoken about this yet since this public outing by Trump,
[397.42 --> 405.06]  but the Intel stock did drop about 4% since Trump's posting. Our discussion question is
[405.06 --> 412.48]  characteristically Eli. Thank you, Elijah for this. How long before Donald calls you out for being
[412.48 --> 420.10]  invested in framework and Eshtec who makes HexOS? Isn't Eshtec an American company? Yes.
[423.18 --> 428.78]  So wouldn't, wouldn't that make him happy? Isn't that literally building in America?
[430.12 --> 434.74]  I think framework is American. I think Carney would need to call you out. I think that's what
[434.74 --> 439.98]  needs to happen. Yeah. Framework's American too. So I don't know. Maybe, maybe I'm in the,
[439.98 --> 445.04]  maybe I'm in the current U S administration's good graces. Yeah. You're, you're just a traitor
[445.04 --> 452.04]  to Canada, not to the States. All right. Sorry, my fellow Canadians. It was, it was truly nice being a
[452.04 --> 461.86]  fellow Canadian with you all. Okay. In all seriousness, I do feel like I already kind of
[461.86 --> 467.68]  covered this when I was just teasing the topic earlier, but, um, while I don't necessarily agree
[467.68 --> 474.76]  with a lot of the things that the current U S administration is doing, um, as far as I can tell,
[474.90 --> 484.60]  whether it's the board or Intel's current CEO or both of them, um, I, I am super unhappy with what's
[484.60 --> 490.52]  happening to Intel right now. And it feels like they're base. They've basically made the decision
[490.52 --> 497.74]  and maybe they know things that I don't know. You know, maybe this whole thing is just doomed. It's,
[497.74 --> 502.56]  it's barreling toward a cliff anyway, and none of this matters, but it seems like pretty much
[502.56 --> 510.76]  everything they have done since he took the helm instead of being like, okay, this is my Canadian
[510.76 --> 518.40]  showing here, I guess, but it feels like Gelsinger came in and he was the unpopular general manager
[518.40 --> 526.04]  who told the fans, okay, it's a full rebuild. We're, we're, we're stripping down the team.
[526.22 --> 532.12]  We're going to have literally multiple seasons of not making the playoffs. Yes, it's a hockey analogy.
[532.50 --> 536.58]  Okay. We're going to have multiple seasons where we don't make the playoffs. We're not even going to,
[536.62 --> 542.02]  we're not even going to smell the Stanley cup for like the next three to five years.
[542.02 --> 549.76]  But what we're going to do is we're going to suck so bad. Um, we're going to put, we're going to put
[549.76 --> 555.74]  everything. We're going to put everything into the future product where we're, we're going back to,
[555.74 --> 561.26]  to, to, to recruitment and the farm team and you know, whatever. Okay. My analogy is falling apart.
[561.34 --> 569.26]  The point is that, um, he came in with a plan that was not a fun plan to endure. And everyone went,
[569.26 --> 575.98]  okay, good plan, full rebuild because we want to win the cup in five years, as opposed to be
[575.98 --> 581.76]  mediocre forever, right? We don't want to be the Vancouver Canucks. Okay. We just want to,
[581.76 --> 589.04]  we just want to suck it up, rebuild and get good later. And then before he got a chance to even like
[589.04 --> 597.62]  practically nothing, practically no products that were actually started, no projects that were started
[597.62 --> 604.10]  under Pat were actually seen through to fruition because he said, it's going to take this long.
[604.24 --> 609.46]  And then they ran out of patience because stock price, I guess. And yes, they were losing a lot
[609.46 --> 617.12]  of money, but that was the plan. The plan was that everything that the previous guys did sucked,
[617.12 --> 624.08]  which we knew, which was why they hired Pat. We knew that nothing good was in the pitch it.
[625.84 --> 630.08]  I mean, they needed to pitch it more Silicon Valley style. Maybe they need to show themselves
[630.08 --> 635.36]  as like a pre-revenue, uh, disruption technology company. Yeah.
[635.92 --> 639.56]  Be like, ignore old Intel. This is new Intel. Yeah.
[639.56 --> 642.32]  Currently pre-revenue seeking investment. Yeah.
[642.32 --> 647.92]  We're going to suck really hard. And just because you're, you might've been a fan of the blue in the
[647.92 --> 650.96]  past, you're going to come back to the store and buy Intel again.
[654.88 --> 661.28]  Dude, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm frustrated though. It's, um, and so, yeah, it just, it feels like
[661.28 --> 669.12]  everything that LBT has done since he came in is just designed around giving up. Whereas like what I
[669.12 --> 675.36]  liked about Pat's vision was the vision was to fight. And I am, you know, it's, it's so,
[675.36 --> 679.52]  it's so funny to watch the perception of me sort of shift around. Cause people be like,
[679.52 --> 683.68]  Lionel's flip-flopping. Now he's, he's cheering for AMD. Now he's cheering for Intel.
[683.68 --> 689.28]  I am always going to root for the underdog in any given market segment, because what I'm always
[689.28 --> 694.96]  rooting for is healthy competition, which is better for the companies because it holds them accountable,
[694.96 --> 699.44]  keeps a fire in their belly. And it's better for consumers because it means lower prices and
[699.44 --> 705.92]  better products. And so, yeah, am I rooting for Intel right now? Hard. And is it good for Intel when
[705.92 --> 712.64]  they're shedding thousands upon thousands upon thousands of jobs? I don't know, maybe actually,
[712.64 --> 720.16]  possibly, but when it seems like those jobs are being shed, just without, as far as I can tell,
[720.16 --> 726.16]  a clear plan to, to, to return to the top. Well, that's, that's where I, that's where I kind of
[726.16 --> 730.88]  lose it. Like what was, what was one of the most recent developments? They're talking about like
[730.88 --> 736.48]  spinning off the networking business and I'm sitting here going, I'm like, okay, okay. Like spinning,
[736.48 --> 743.20]  spin off can be a good thing. Like I, I have personally advocated for Nvidia spinning off their
[743.20 --> 749.60]  GeForce business. I think it could make a ton of sense for the users of GeForce products.
[749.60 --> 757.04]  If, if Nvidia didn't have to have their, uh, like their, their, their margins dragged down
[757.04 --> 761.44]  by this business unit that frankly, you know, no one at the top really cares about anymore.
[761.44 --> 766.16]  You designate people who are supposed to care about it. It has lower margin targets and it can
[766.16 --> 772.32]  just go back to delighting gamers, which is what GeForce used to do right before they all stopped
[772.32 --> 779.28]  caring about it completely. Yeah. Um, so I've advocated for this before, but on the Intel side of
[779.28 --> 782.48]  things, it's just like, Oh yeah, we'll, we're going to spin out this. We're going to spin out that.
[782.48 --> 788.00]  And it looks more like they're spinning out things as acquisition targets and less like they're
[788.00 --> 793.36]  spinning out business units so that they can overall perform more efficiently as a company. I just,
[794.72 --> 799.28]  yeah. Light master one. I can't believe we're at the point where Intel is the underdog that we need to,
[799.28 --> 802.72]  that we need to root for because otherwise we're going to be left with one
[802.72 --> 809.84]  X86 processor company. Like I don't, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know all the details around it,
[809.84 --> 818.32]  but from my understanding, neither Intel nor AMD has the right to assign their X86 license.
[818.32 --> 825.12]  So if for whatever reason they are not leapfrogging each other, you just have a frog.
[825.76 --> 832.64]  It doesn't leap anymore. You just have a frog. It just sits on the pedal. It just sits there.
[833.60 --> 838.16]  Yeah. And like if, if, you know, Intel seems to have some aspirations in the GPU space to go higher
[838.16 --> 842.88]  and higher, um, AMD doesn't seem to care about their GPU space that much right now because they
[842.88 --> 848.56]  just can't stop winning on CPU. Um, actually, actually Dr. Sue did an interview. I think it was
[848.56 --> 855.92]  earlier this week where she basically said what everyone knows, which is that, um, the,
[855.92 --> 861.92]  the issue for them on the GPU side is that, uh, they need to make more. So maybe she cares. It did.
[861.92 --> 868.32]  It legitimately sounded like she cared. I need to manufacture more. I, yeah,
[868.32 --> 873.76]  she's like, yeah, we're bottling that we're bottlenecked by how much we can make right now.
[873.76 --> 878.08]  And, and we want to make more is pretty much what I took away from it. So I'm maybe Intel
[878.08 --> 885.12]  should spin off their foundries and AMD should buy them. No, I think the days of, I think the days of
[885.68 --> 890.88]  vertical integration, if Intel can't make it work, I don't think it's happening, man. I just don't
[890.88 --> 897.60]  think it's happening. The problem is that we need a second foundry and Samsung just doesn't seem to be
[897.60 --> 906.24]  able to do it. Not at the cutting edge. Yeah. Cause it all just comes down to TSMC being a monopoly and
[906.24 --> 915.92]  ASML being the monopoly that TSMC is beholden to. Yeah. And I have some hope when it comes to fab tools.
[915.92 --> 923.12]  It sounds like Japan has kind of gone like, like, that seems like they're kind of like awake. Um,
[923.12 --> 931.04]  seeing how much, how much, how much money ASML is contributing to their national economy. Um,
[931.04 --> 937.12]  yeah. And you know what, look, if there's anyone who is going to kind of figure out the optics and,
[937.84 --> 942.48]  uh, figure out cutting edge manufacturing, I'd say if I was going to bet on a horse, Japan would
[942.48 --> 948.16]  certainly be one I'd be strongly considering. Uh, there's a lot of expertise there, but right now
[948.16 --> 953.60]  it's not happening. And I'm just, I'm stressed dude. Cause you see what AMD does when they get
[953.60 --> 960.80]  complacent. We waited two years between thread rippers just now two years. And the top end
[960.80 --> 967.52]  chip is five grand. Do you remember first and even to a degree second and third gen thread ripper?
[968.48 --> 974.96]  They were like killer value. I remember when the first Intel extreme chip broke a thousand dollars and
[974.96 --> 980.16]  everyone freaked out. Dude, AMD was practically giving it away on the street corner back when
[980.16 --> 986.64]  first gen thread ripper came out. And it's like, now they're, now they're all like, you know,
[987.28 --> 994.48]  you gotta, you gotta take me out first, buy me some fancy presents, you know, make me feel like your
[994.48 --> 1000.64]  real girlfriend. It's like, bro, this is a transaction. I just want my, I just want my CPU,
[1000.64 --> 1005.84]  you know, I don't want to treat you nice. Just give me my CPU course.
[1006.48 --> 1011.60]  Let's see. I think, I think a lot of that stuff happens in the city that I'm in right now. Um,
[1014.24 --> 1016.12]  sorry, you're going to elaborate or is that it?
[1017.44 --> 1020.40]  Your analogy of, uh, not wanting to take them out to dinner.
[1020.40 --> 1031.36]  Oh, I'm in Vegas. Oh yeah. Okay. Sure. It seems like the, the guests to Vegas are really low.
[1032.08 --> 1039.28]  Like there's a lot, there's not very many just like people here. Uh, well, you always go during CES
[1039.28 --> 1044.48]  though. So that might just be, I've heard this is a thing though. Oh really? There seems to be less
[1044.48 --> 1049.68]  people here than there was the last time I was here for DEFCON. Um, and like, it seems like there's
[1049.68 --> 1054.00]  probably the same amount or more DEFCON attendees, but like the, the like random people within Vegas
[1054.00 --> 1059.20]  seems the population seems very low right now. Well, it seems to be a very, uh, K like, uh,
[1059.20 --> 1066.00]  economic recovery is the, is kind of the, the term. Um, it seems like the higher income folks are
[1066.00 --> 1070.00]  feeling real great about how things are going. I mean, the stock markets, what all time high
[1070.00 --> 1074.80]  gold is near all time high. I haven't actually paid attention to Bitcoin recently. What's that?
[1074.80 --> 1081.68]  Bitcoin to USD. Um, not all time high, but it's, it's basically near all time high.
[1082.24 --> 1086.32]  Like everything's near all time high. So if you're investor class, you're sitting, you're
[1086.32 --> 1092.88]  sitting good. You're sitting tight, you're sitting easy. Um, but as far as my understanding goes, there
[1092.88 --> 1101.12]  is a big reported drop in attendance to Vegas in general. Um, and you can feel just walking around that
[1101.12 --> 1110.24]  the people working to people here to vacation or whatever. Um, the ratios are like off. It's,
[1110.24 --> 1115.36]  it's weird. Uh, like, you know, the, there's taxi lines outside of the hotels.
[1116.72 --> 1122.40]  Um, now there's just like a massive row of taxis and nobody there. Uh, when I went to get picked up
[1122.40 --> 1128.56]  from the airport, I was waiting for an Uber and at least five or six like black cars came by asking if
[1128.56 --> 1132.40]  I needed a ride and then they drove off to other people that were standing near the road. No,
[1132.40 --> 1137.36]  one's ever offered me a ride in Vegas. No, like you gotta, you have to like, you have to like fight
[1137.36 --> 1145.52]  someone to get a car is more like, and there is, there is a, yeah, there's just, there's a lot of
[1145.52 --> 1151.44]  people here working and not an incredible amount of people here, uh, attending it seems.
[1151.44 --> 1163.60]  Oh man, the chat is so dude, the chat is too real right now. Avon Fox says Vegas was a magnet for
[1163.60 --> 1172.80]  the poor with hopes. No one can afford to go there now, even for hope. Honestly, I think Cren nailed it,
[1172.80 --> 1179.04]  though. Everyone's just sports betting now. Yeah. Like why go, why go to Vegas to do that?
[1179.04 --> 1185.76]  Yeah. When you can do it from the toilet. And there was, and there was sports betting in Vegas
[1185.76 --> 1191.04]  before. Yeah. I mean, but you could, you could play blackjack and, and slots online before and
[1191.04 --> 1196.48]  Vegas was still popular. Yeah, that's true. And they have arenas here now. Like they have the
[1196.48 --> 1203.84]  Vegas Golden Knights. So you can come bet on sports in person. Yeah. But it might just be a generational shift.
[1203.84 --> 1211.52]  Yeah. And you know, like you're saying, K-shaped economy, the lower end doesn't have as much money
[1211.52 --> 1216.32]  to blow on gambling. I know people don't stop spending. In some cases, they spend more on
[1216.32 --> 1221.28]  entertainment, uh, when the economy is bad because everything sucks. They want to make themselves feel
[1221.28 --> 1230.64]  better. So they, they spend money on entertainment. Um, but traveling somewhere in order to blow all your money
[1230.64 --> 1237.12]  is maybe, uh, one of the first things I, uh, is maybe one of the first things for some people to go
[1237.12 --> 1241.60]  when it comes to entertainment spending. Oh, which, which airline just, uh, did a bunch of layoffs?
[1244.40 --> 1250.72]  Hold on. Who was it? Uh, no, I thought someone did. Oh no. Maybe, maybe I was reading about the
[1250.72 --> 1256.24]  strike. Oh no. Yeah. Spirit. Spirit says that they're going to furlough 270 pilots. Uh, I don't know if
[1256.24 --> 1261.60]  spirits just doing bad though. So yeah, make, make of that, make of that what you will. Uh,
[1261.60 --> 1269.28]  solid deer says Southwest is having a hard time apparently though. Um, yeah, I don't know. It's
[1269.28 --> 1277.76]  a funny thing because I keep, I keep people seem to be generally afraid to use the R word recession.
[1277.76 --> 1292.32]  What? What? What Dan, what'd you think I was going to say? My stocks. I got to sell.
[1292.88 --> 1300.40]  See people, people seem to be afraid to, to use the R word. And yet everything that I can see is like
[1302.40 --> 1306.00]  unemployment is incredibly high. Layoffs are happening. Are we going to, are we going to use
[1306.00 --> 1308.64]  the word? We're losing a lot of good jobs and gaining a bunch of junk jobs.
[1308.64 --> 1315.60]  Luxury brands are, are downgrading their guidance, um, due to softening demand. I, man, I got,
[1315.60 --> 1321.36]  dude, can I just as an aside? Okay. So I, I was also traveling this week. I actually just got back this
[1321.36 --> 1329.68]  morning. Um, I went to Edmonton. I, it's a funny thing. I never really did much travel within Canada.
[1329.68 --> 1334.56]  Um, but this summer we were looking to go somewhere and we were like, what the heck? Why don't we road trip?
[1334.56 --> 1340.00]  And then the smash champs grand opening tournament got accidentally scheduled for the time when we
[1340.00 --> 1343.76]  would have been driving. So we flew there, but whatever. The point is that, uh, we decided to
[1343.76 --> 1348.40]  go to Edmonton. I I'd never actually been to West Edmonton mall. Did you know that it is the 29th
[1348.40 --> 1356.00]  largest mall in the world? No. Yeah, it is. It's the 29th largest mall in the world.
[1356.96 --> 1359.28]  I feel like that number was a lot higher when I was there.
[1359.28 --> 1364.88]  Probably. I mean, it was built in like the eighties and it definitely shows, but you know what?
[1365.52 --> 1372.48]  For a short trip, right? Like we were only there for three days. Um, yeah, living in the mall,
[1372.48 --> 1377.60]  kind of cool. We stayed in the fantasy land hotel or fantasy suites hotel or something like that.
[1377.60 --> 1385.76]  Every floor has a different theme. Uh, so my kids were, um, what was it like pirate theme or something
[1385.76 --> 1390.32]  like that? I forget. They were like treasure cove theme or something. And then, uh, Yvonne and I were,
[1391.20 --> 1395.84]  um, like Tiki theme of some sort. Anyway, the point is like, they've got all these different kinds of
[1395.84 --> 1399.28]  themes and you walk out of your hotel. You don't even walk out of your hotel. You walk
[1399.28 --> 1403.76]  out from the elevator and you just like walk into the mall and it's like, oh, well I could go,
[1403.76 --> 1411.04]  I could go grab a yoga and fruze or I could go ice skating. Uh, they have a two level go-kart track
[1411.04 --> 1417.20]  that the water park is also like actually awesome. We spent an entire day at the water park. I have a
[1417.20 --> 1425.84]  great slow-mo video, um, of Yvonne in the tube at the top of, uh, at the top of the, the cyclone,
[1425.84 --> 1432.32]  I think it's called. Um, so the one that goes almost a vertical drop and then goes around a thing
[1432.32 --> 1438.56]  and then rips back down to the, yeah. Uh, so I, I have her like, as, as the bottom drops out under,
[1438.56 --> 1445.52]  it's pretty funny. Um, so yeah, no, it was, uh, it was a blast. I forget where I was going with this.
[1445.52 --> 1452.96]  What on earth were we talking about again? Uh, I was in Edmonton. I was going somewhere with this.
[1452.96 --> 1459.92]  Dan just changed the thing to topic too. Hold on. Help me out here guys. Sorry. I'm not helpful.
[1459.92 --> 1466.00]  You being in Edmonton. Uh, is there? Yeah. Yeah. Somewhere. Why was I in Edmonton? Oh,
[1466.00 --> 1471.92]  for some reason, Linus went to Edmonton question mark. That's a topic. Uh, oh yeah. Vegas and traveling.
[1471.92 --> 1476.40]  Oh yeah. Yeah. People in chat called it. You were talking about luxury goods. Oh yeah. Oh, right,
[1476.40 --> 1481.28]  right, right, right, right, right. So I was in, so I was basically living in a mall. Um, and
[1481.28 --> 1490.08]  I don't get it. I don't get it. There's entire stores. You don't get the mall or what? Literally,
[1490.08 --> 1493.76]  literally there was this store. I don't even remember the brand. Maybe, maybe Yvonne would
[1493.76 --> 1500.48]  remember the brand, but they, they literally had like a, you know, like a velvet rope across the
[1500.48 --> 1505.76]  entrance of the store. Like a, like a, like a, like a you, you're probably too poor to come in,
[1505.76 --> 1511.92]  but if you're not, I guess you can ask nicely and we can kind of look you up and down and see if
[1511.92 --> 1518.48]  you're good enough to get, you know what? F*** off. Like I, this whole, this whole luxury goods thing.
[1519.04 --> 1524.24]  I just, I can't, I think that's the whole point. I can't stand it, Luke. I actually can't stand it.
[1524.24 --> 1527.92]  I don't mind something expensive. I agree, but I do think that's the whole point. I'm literally going to
[1527.92 --> 1534.88]  try to sell you fancy stickers for your 70 us dollar screwdriver later, later in this show. I am
[1534.88 --> 1544.00]  going to sell those to you, but it's because they have a cost there. The, the, this is it, it, it has
[1544.00 --> 1551.84]  a more satisfying ratchet. It's like that. I can't tell the difference. They don't have, they don't have
[1551.84 --> 1559.92]  $4,000 worth of leather on that bag. What? It's made of the same, it's made of the same stupid cow.
[1560.96 --> 1565.84]  Like, what are we even talking about here? I love the Chinese manufacturing companies going on social
[1565.84 --> 1573.28]  media and pointing out like, by the way, we make all these brands stuff. Now there has been some
[1573.28 --> 1580.96]  controversy. Some of that may not entirely be true. Some of this stuff is legitimately like made in Italy.
[1580.96 --> 1586.32]  However, it is worth noting that just because something is made in Italy doesn't necessarily
[1586.32 --> 1594.56]  mean that it is made under good conditions with like artisans making it. And sometimes both things
[1594.56 --> 1602.32]  can be true for the same brand. Like their, their, their halo product might actually be like artisan
[1602.32 --> 1608.24]  crafted by people who handed down the skill of sewing through generations or whatever, right?
[1608.24 --> 1612.56]  There may be a legitimate actual reason, or there's like, there's like a special cotton that
[1612.56 --> 1617.92]  grows in this like one valley where the conditions are ideal or, you know, something. And it's like
[1617.92 --> 1622.88]  extra special, super awesome or something. Sometimes there is a legitimate sort of,
[1623.92 --> 1630.48]  maybe not a reason, but a justification. There's a, there's, there's a, there's a, there's a cost
[1630.48 --> 1637.28]  associated with the high price. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. There is a cost associated
[1637.28 --> 1645.04]  with making a really nice precision built tool, um, and backing it with the trust me, bro warranty.
[1645.04 --> 1649.68]  Like that is something that has a cost. If we had no warranty, we could drop the price tomorrow
[1649.68 --> 1655.76]  because we wouldn't have to absorb warranty claims indefinitely. Um, like there's just, there's,
[1655.76 --> 1660.48]  there's cost of doing business stuff that everybody ultimately the consumer has to pay for.
[1660.48 --> 1667.36]  Um, however, there are also products that you look at and you go, yeah,
[1669.52 --> 1676.96]  you, the designer who worked on this doesn't even get a credit on it, right? Like it's just under the
[1676.96 --> 1682.88]  label. So you're not even, you're not even like buying the work of a designer that you really like
[1682.88 --> 1687.60]  or respect or connect with or whatever. Cause I can understand that as well. Like we've had,
[1687.60 --> 1692.64]  we've had products, like we've had shirt designs for instance, that Sarah has drawn on stream and
[1692.64 --> 1700.56]  that people appreciate the art of, and, and pay to support that. That has a value that has a real value.
[1701.28 --> 1707.52]  But we're, we've got this nameless faceless designer who just like works for a company and
[1707.52 --> 1713.28]  it's clearly mass produced, which now that I know as much as I know from working with the fine folks
[1713.28 --> 1719.20]  at creator warehouse, it's pretty easy for me to spot when something is just machine mass produced
[1719.20 --> 1726.96]  in a, in a factory under conditions that I don't know what they are, but to, to produce that volume
[1726.96 --> 1733.20]  of it, I can pretty much promise you it isn't, you know, uh, two families that handed down the
[1733.20 --> 1737.28]  skills of how to thread this needle through there for several, seven generations or whatever. It
[1737.28 --> 1742.64]  probably didn't happen. Um, and I just, I just don't understand the prices of it. And, uh, it's,
[1742.64 --> 1747.20]  it's one of those things that I, that I go out of my way to, to click on in my, in my recommendation
[1747.20 --> 1752.08]  algorithms is I kind of pay attention to the luxury market just because I think it can be a bit of a
[1752.08 --> 1759.68]  bellwether for how things are going. And, um, kind of depends on McKay.
[1759.68 --> 1764.08]  One of the things that even luxury consumers, well, that's see, that's the thing though,
[1764.08 --> 1770.24]  is these luxury brands have not experienced the growth that they have from ultra high net worth
[1770.24 --> 1776.56]  individuals. The growth that they've experienced is from aspirational purchases, they call them.
[1776.56 --> 1784.48]  So that's people who earn a more modest income, but can afford one. They aspire to own like, like
[1784.48 --> 1791.92]  one piece that they like baby, you know, so it's instead of a, an Xbox, they buy a, exactly,
[1791.92 --> 1798.40]  exactly. Uh, or a pair of shoes or a purse or, or exact, or a pair of sunglasses, you know,
[1798.40 --> 1802.32]  whatever it is. I didn't say purse just because some of the purses from those brands are like
[1803.04 --> 1809.20]  40 grand, you know, 10, 20 X boxes, maybe more than that. But, but the, the point is just that for
[1809.20 --> 1814.48]  them, that's what it is. That's their, that's their baby. Right. And, and, you know, look,
[1814.48 --> 1819.52]  whatever I'm personally, not my value system, but, um, if, if you're into that, then you're into it.
[1819.52 --> 1823.76]  Um, and apparently the, these aspirational buyers are just
[1825.92 --> 1832.88]  disappearing right now. Yeah. And, and, and they're feeling super butthurt that since the,
[1832.88 --> 1839.04]  like, uh, kind of the COVID spike in the price of everything, um, there, there's this kind of,
[1839.04 --> 1842.96]  there was this one article that I was reading where they were looking at like price tracking
[1842.96 --> 1848.64]  for like the same item from these luxury brands, like pre COVID to now. And some of them like doubled
[1848.64 --> 1854.72]  or tripled in price. So they really took advantage of that surge in demand, uh, from people being pent up
[1854.72 --> 1861.44]  and, um, spending more of their disposable income on consumption versus, uh, versus travel,
[1861.44 --> 1866.72]  you're eating out. And, um, and now these people are just kind of feeling kind of
[1867.60 --> 1873.28]  peeved that what used to maybe be somewhat within reach as an aspirational item is no longer within
[1873.28 --> 1875.92]  reach. And they're questioning why I ever bothered to do this in the first place.
[1876.96 --> 1882.72]  Um, I think it's called a work in. So there's a, you can at Walmart, like through marketplace,
[1882.72 --> 1889.12]  you can buy like Birkin bag of likes that are a fraction of the price and apparently like pretty deece.
[1889.12 --> 1898.24]  Um, got it working. I think, I think it's called a work in bag, W I R K work in bag. Hold on. Uh,
[1898.24 --> 1903.28]  yeah. Yeah. It's called a work in. And this is like, it's a, it's a whole thing. Like I just,
[1903.28 --> 1911.60]  I find the whole space super, super fascinating. Um, I took a work in for a test drive and the results
[1911.60 --> 1917.20]  were surprising. Can you, can you imagine being able to write this much about a handbag?
[1917.20 --> 1923.20]  Like sometimes we struggle to write this many words about like an entire computer that has,
[1924.08 --> 1931.92]  is, is manu, has parts in it that are manufactured to such a scale that people even 10 years ago
[1931.92 --> 1939.12]  couldn't possibly have fathomed it like on an atomic scale. And it's, uh, you can really say this much
[1939.12 --> 1945.68]  about a handbag, which you know what we, I just have some learning to do clearly.
[1948.08 --> 1949.60]  What a diplomatic way to say that.
[1950.48 --> 1957.92]  I have learning to do. I could do better. Anyway, the point is that I went to a mall and I lived there
[1957.92 --> 1965.28]  for three days and I, I visited with my brother who moved there a couple of years ago. Uh, cost of
[1965.28 --> 1973.76]  living is like markedly better. Shout out Edmonton. If you don't mind living in Edmonton, um, fun fact,
[1973.76 --> 1977.28]  did not know this. He's, he's full of little fun facts about Edmonton now that he lives there.
[1977.76 --> 1982.56]  Um, it is apparently, I'm just going based on what my brother said. So make of this what you will,
[1982.56 --> 1989.44]  but it is apparently the Northern most like metropolis, like city with over a hundred,
[1989.44 --> 1994.64]  all right, over a hundred with over a million full-time residents, which I didn't know. I
[1994.64 --> 2003.68]  didn't realize how North flipping Edmonton is. It's very North. Yeah. I just, I just never really
[2004.56 --> 2009.36]  thought about it. Like I obviously look at a map of Canada, but part of the problem with looking at
[2009.36 --> 2013.92]  Canada on a flat map. What's the system called where we, where we like flatten it out and it
[2013.92 --> 2019.44]  skews it. Oh yeah. Sorry. What's it called, Dan? Of course Dan would know. Yeah. Something like that.
[2019.44 --> 2026.24]  The Mercantor projection. Anyway, the point is looking at Canada on a map is really misleading
[2026.24 --> 2033.04]  unless you happen to like have a globe. And so I just never really like thought about it.
[2033.04 --> 2040.96]  Yeah. Edmonton's like really far North. Yeah. The mall is cool because you can stay indoors and
[2040.96 --> 2045.44]  do all those things. Like that's one of the reasons why that mall was like worth building.
[2045.44 --> 2049.04]  Oh dude, I got a weather, got a weather advisory on my phone and I was like,
[2050.64 --> 2055.84]  who cares? I'm in the mall. Like that's, it's really, uh, it's, it's basically a shelter. It's,
[2055.84 --> 2059.84]  it's fascinating the amount of ways that you can kind of like get there because it's connected to
[2059.84 --> 2064.08]  things. Yeah. Like you said, there's the hotel that's connected to it. They have to have numbered
[2064.08 --> 2068.88]  to get there without going outside. They have to have numbered entrances. We were at entrance 52,
[2069.44 --> 2073.68]  which gives you some idea how big the mall is that it needs 52 numbered entrances.
[2074.56 --> 2081.84]  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's really, it's a bastion against the, like the, the cold storm.
[2081.84 --> 2089.44]  That's, that's really, yeah. That actually makes a ton of sense. Yeah. Like there's, there's,
[2089.44 --> 2093.12]  uh, some, I think it was already in chat said that he thinks that at one point in time,
[2093.12 --> 2097.84]  it was number one. He said it was number like 20 something. When I was there, I think it was
[2097.84 --> 2102.48]  low double digits or high single digits for how big of a mall it was. And you think about the
[2102.48 --> 2110.32]  population of Edmonton versus where these bigger malls are and it like is still quite a standout.
[2110.32 --> 2117.04]  Um, oh yeah. Mall size per capita. It's, it's gotta still be up there, dude. It's gotta be up there.
[2117.04 --> 2120.08]  And there's a reason for it. And the reason is cause it's in the, you know,
[2120.08 --> 2125.28]  northernmost metropolis, like you said. Yeah. Really cool. And dude, it was hopping.
[2125.92 --> 2133.60]  Like already says it was the biggest until 2004. Really? So it's just been a surge in giant malls
[2133.60 --> 2140.08]  since then. I actually did not know that. When we were there, it even had a shooting range inside it.
[2140.08 --> 2147.60]  Really? I mean, that doesn't, that doesn't surprise me one bit. Uh, definitely a lot of,
[2147.60 --> 2156.08]  definitely a lot of gun culture. Um, yeah, yeah. My, my brother like just moved into a new place. Um,
[2156.32 --> 2166.72]  and furniture, furniture was a little on the, on the deprioritized side. So we, we all kind of piled onto
[2166.72 --> 2170.56]  the couch. I, Yvonne and I were there and we had all the kids and we, we had lunch at his place.
[2171.84 --> 2175.60]  Um, it's a very bachelor Patty, but he did, he did show me his many guns.
[2176.80 --> 2181.84]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He, uh, he went out and, uh, and don't have furniture.
[2182.96 --> 2188.24]  Sorry. Sorry. What was that? Guns don't sit people. People sit people or something.
[2188.24 --> 2199.44]  Uh, yeah, no, he, uh, he, he, he picked up, um, uh, I forget what it's called. I'm, I'm,
[2199.44 --> 2204.96]  as you know, I'm not much of a gun nerd, but he, uh, right when they were, um, when they were shutting
[2204.96 --> 2212.72]  down the, uh, the handguns. Yeah. So he basically just went and bought the first handgun he could find,
[2212.72 --> 2217.28]  did absolutely no research on it whatsoever because he had like two days when he realized that the deadline
[2217.28 --> 2222.80]  was coming up. So he was like, I just like want a handgun, uh, and, and like went and got this thing
[2222.80 --> 2227.48]  and, uh, he showed it to me. I got to say, I'm not much of a gun nerd, but it was like, uh, like a
[2227.48 --> 2241.26]  Czech, um, uh, law enforcement pistol. Super nice. Absolutely. Like a shadow zero. Uh, a CZ shadow.
[2241.26 --> 2247.24]  I wouldn't know. Anyway, it's apparently completely steel. Uh, it's super heavy, even without
[2247.24 --> 2252.14]  a, without a loaded magazine in it. It was like super heavy. And dude, the slide was some of the
[2252.14 --> 2257.80]  most beautiful precision machining I think I've ever seen. Um, it's like gotta be a shadow.
[2259.40 --> 2267.84]  Anyway, anyway, it's, uh, a fine piece. I, what I, like I said, not a gun nerd, but definitely a
[2267.84 --> 2276.34]  machining nerd. And it is a beautifully, beautifully machined little piece. Um, so I congratulated him
[2276.34 --> 2281.82]  on his firearm as I think you're supposed to do. And then we, uh, when we walked to the park and hung
[2281.82 --> 2291.76]  out, it was good. Do you remember if the slide had, um, holes on the side of it or just angled slashes?
[2291.76 --> 2292.88]  Dude.
[2296.88 --> 2299.98]  I thought I'd ask. Yeah, it's like, I bet you it's the shadow. A bunch of people in shadow
[2299.98 --> 2303.84]  are saying, uh, 75. Look, it's, it's one of those things. And shadows are really common.
[2303.84 --> 2309.62]  It's, it's, it's like, it's like asking me if that hot dude at the pool, you know, had
[2309.62 --> 2313.66]  a six pack or an eight pack. It's like, I'm not gay.
[2313.66 --> 2321.88]  Like, uh, I don't, like, it's totally fine for other people to be into it.
[2322.08 --> 2324.44]  I'm just Myron, bro. I'm just Myron.
[2324.60 --> 2325.42]  I just can't tell.
[2325.42 --> 2326.06]  I'm just Myron.
[2326.30 --> 2332.44]  I don't know, I don't know what the characteristics I'm supposed to be looking for are to know if it was
[2332.44 --> 2334.34]  sexually appealing. That's all.
[2334.34 --> 2339.78]  That's actually a really good, that's actually a really good analogy. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2339.78 --> 2346.42]  That's pretty good. Couldn't tell you anything about it other than the machining. Very fine.
[2347.16 --> 2347.66]  Very nice.
[2347.72 --> 2354.30]  Because that I know. That, that I get. Um, Miori says you don't have to be gay to observe.
[2355.10 --> 2357.00]  No, but you would have to.
[2357.44 --> 2364.48]  No, but he recognized that it was an attractive person. He just didn't log all of the individual
[2364.48 --> 2365.56]  little details. Because I.
[2365.72 --> 2366.84]  The analogy is great, actually.
[2366.84 --> 2371.58]  I don't know what the important details are. Because I'm not, I'm genuinely not, I would,
[2371.64 --> 2375.30]  I would actually have to have someone, like, explain it to me. It's not something that I,
[2375.42 --> 2377.86]  like, can tell. You know, like, I can.
[2377.88 --> 2381.18]  Which, and to be clear, the question that I asked isn't even an important detail. I just,
[2381.38 --> 2384.54]  I looked on their website and it was a differentiating factor, so I thought I'd ask.
[2384.86 --> 2387.98]  But, but I, I think the analogy was fantastic, honestly.
[2387.98 --> 2390.54]  It completely makes sense.
[2390.84 --> 2391.16]  Um.
[2392.88 --> 2393.32]  And, yeah.
[2394.74 --> 2399.66]  Okay, should we do a second topic? I can't, I can't believe how, oh man, I was looking
[2399.66 --> 2403.38]  at how few topics we had today and I was like, man, it's going to be a really short show.
[2403.92 --> 2406.86]  We've been live for almost an hour, including pre-show.
[2407.68 --> 2409.82]  And we've only done the first topic?
[2409.86 --> 2411.38]  We've done one topic, I think.
[2411.38 --> 2414.28]  No, we technically did Linus Goes to Edmonton.
[2414.74 --> 2415.62]  So we did two topics.
[2415.72 --> 2417.16]  Okay, yeah, cool.
[2417.68 --> 2419.64]  Water park, strongly recommend.
[2420.10 --> 2421.32]  The water slides were great.
[2421.52 --> 2424.52]  I think that was the second most fun I've ever had on a water slide,
[2425.02 --> 2426.76]  on that, on that cyclone one.
[2427.00 --> 2427.76]  Super awesome.
[2427.90 --> 2431.28]  The, like, the almost free fall drop is intense.
[2431.68 --> 2435.26]  And they're, they call it the typhoon, but I'm sure it has other names.
[2435.62 --> 2439.20]  They're one where you go down a slide and then you go into, like, a toilet bowl
[2439.20 --> 2443.02]  until you, like, fall down into a deep pool at the bottom.
[2443.20 --> 2444.44]  You've been in one like that before.
[2444.50 --> 2445.22]  They have one at Cultus.
[2445.30 --> 2445.44]  Yep.
[2446.02 --> 2446.34]  Dude.
[2446.34 --> 2446.98]  I've been in that one.
[2447.56 --> 2448.38]  The one at Cultus?
[2449.12 --> 2449.48]  Yeah.
[2449.66 --> 2450.02]  Well, cool.
[2450.02 --> 2451.02]  The one at Cultus blows.
[2451.36 --> 2453.22]  And the one at West Edmonton Mall.
[2453.22 --> 2458.14]  So the one at West Edmonton Mall, they went in there with some kind of compound
[2458.14 --> 2461.36]  in the seams for all the cracks.
[2462.28 --> 2463.22]  So, like...
[2463.22 --> 2463.88]  That's nice.
[2463.98 --> 2467.64]  I was only able to do two loops around the one at Cultus.
[2467.70 --> 2468.50]  I went this summer.
[2468.50 --> 2472.20]  So I am the same me as when I just went to the mall just now.
[2472.98 --> 2476.68]  And I was only able to do two loops around because it was just too painful
[2476.68 --> 2480.38]  on my elbows and my heels and, like, my shoulder blades to, like,
[2480.76 --> 2482.00]  to get that low friction.
[2482.92 --> 2483.10]  Yeah.
[2483.20 --> 2485.38]  At the one at West Edmonton Mall, I could do three and a half,
[2486.04 --> 2487.62]  which was freaking awesome.
[2487.72 --> 2490.56]  Like, I got so much speed because they went in with some kind of, like,
[2490.60 --> 2494.36]  compound and they filled in all the little seams.
[2494.60 --> 2497.24]  So you could, like, I was able to, like, grab the bar and, like,
[2497.24 --> 2499.08]  really rip down there and it didn't hurt at all.
[2499.14 --> 2500.44]  Dude, it was freaking awesome.
[2501.12 --> 2501.80]  Freaking awesome.
[2502.58 --> 2503.14]  That's cool.
[2507.02 --> 2508.38]  Should we talk about AI stuff?
[2508.54 --> 2509.30]  I mean, I guess.
[2509.76 --> 2512.32]  I mean, I could just talk about the water park more if you want.
[2512.62 --> 2513.48]  But sure, yeah, fine.
[2513.50 --> 2513.78]  I mean, you can.
[2514.08 --> 2514.46]  You can.
[2514.46 --> 2518.10]  Sure, let's talk about what's going to take all of our jobs and ruin the world.
[2518.78 --> 2519.14]  Nope.
[2519.26 --> 2524.12]  But hey, at least we have bunnies on trampolines.
[2527.16 --> 2529.02]  Is that in the topic?
[2529.52 --> 2532.50]  No, that was, like, last week, two weeks ago or something.
[2532.58 --> 2532.70]  Oh, okay.
[2533.08 --> 2533.40]  Sure.
[2533.40 --> 2536.22]  The sources for this is everything.
[2536.36 --> 2539.00]  Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Mashable, Anthropic, Eleven Labs,
[2539.20 --> 2542.90]  three different TechCrunch articles, multiple Twitter threads, etc.
[2543.12 --> 2545.00]  It's been a massive week for AI announcements.
[2545.34 --> 2547.06]  Google DeepMind announced Genie 3,
[2547.42 --> 2551.74]  a world model that can turn a text prompt into a fully interactive 3D environment
[2551.74 --> 2553.48]  you can explore in real time.
[2554.14 --> 2557.30]  Compared to Genie 2, it's more consistent, more realistic,
[2557.30 --> 2561.80]  and interactive for minutes at a time instead of, realistically, seconds.
[2561.80 --> 2566.06]  You can also even revisit locations and see them persist,
[2566.22 --> 2568.40]  which was a major problem in the past.
[2568.84 --> 2571.88]  Think Sora, but for navigatable worlds, not just video.
[2572.36 --> 2577.64]  And then Linus, do you want to bring up the example of a drone shot generated by VO3?
[2578.14 --> 2578.84]  Sure, I'll do that.
[2578.88 --> 2581.50]  We're just looking at Genie 2 versus Genie 3 right now.
[2582.14 --> 2582.66]  Okay.
[2584.02 --> 2587.30]  So definitely improvements to world persistence.
[2588.60 --> 2590.86]  I'd really like to see him turn around, though.
[2591.80 --> 2593.12]  Yeah, turn around.
[2593.92 --> 2598.12]  Yeah, he's really avoiding a lot of turning to previous locations.
[2598.12 --> 2599.68]  Go ahead.
[2600.18 --> 2600.56]  Turn around.
[2600.62 --> 2601.06]  I want to see.
[2605.34 --> 2605.74]  Wow.
[2606.88 --> 2609.00]  You got to get really close to the mic when you say that.
[2609.20 --> 2609.82]  Sorry, sorry.
[2610.62 --> 2611.30]  Anyway, okay.
[2611.36 --> 2612.90]  So sorry, that was Genie 2, Genie 3.
[2612.90 --> 2614.96]  I mean, I guess you could kind of run it longer.
[2615.34 --> 2623.62]  Okay, so here's a drone shot generated by VO3 being taken over and controlled in real time.
[2624.08 --> 2625.48]  There's probably a drone thought somewhere.
[2625.76 --> 2626.52]  Drone thought.
[2626.72 --> 2627.02]  Jeez.
[2627.02 --> 2628.58]  Okay.
[2631.08 --> 2633.20]  So here's the generated video.
[2634.32 --> 2634.76]  Okay.
[2636.38 --> 2638.92]  And we're going to take control mid-flight.
[2640.14 --> 2643.18]  And then we'll be able to move it around.
[2643.68 --> 2644.48]  I guess that's in...
[2644.48 --> 2644.74]  Oh, yeah.
[2644.80 --> 2645.30]  No, here we go.
[2645.36 --> 2645.52]  Yep.
[2645.52 --> 2647.90]  So we're controlling it now.
[2649.36 --> 2650.00]  Okay.
[2651.34 --> 2659.30]  I guess the big difference is in real time we're able to generate this landscape as we go.
[2660.74 --> 2662.60]  Flippin' wild how...
[2662.60 --> 2666.42]  For short clips anyway, how kind of actually pretty convincing it is.
[2666.94 --> 2667.56]  Yeah.
[2667.90 --> 2669.76]  At least at X resolution.
[2671.14 --> 2672.20]  What else we got?
[2672.20 --> 2682.08]  A DeepMind researcher posted a video of people playing around with Genie 3 to which someone asked if that video was created using Genie 3 to which the researcher then actually...
[2682.08 --> 2682.52]  Did it.
[2682.94 --> 2683.42]  So here.
[2683.66 --> 2683.92]  Okay.
[2684.00 --> 2684.30]  So here.
[2684.38 --> 2685.48]  This is pretty funny.
[2685.58 --> 2686.92]  Oh, am I not...
[2686.92 --> 2688.80]  Oh, I signed in at some point.
[2689.16 --> 2690.74]  So anyway, this is the original video.
[2690.84 --> 2693.68]  Was them just like playing around with Genie 3 on lunch?
[2694.14 --> 2696.68]  And then they used Genie 3 to...
[2698.76 --> 2699.64]  Here you go.
[2699.88 --> 2701.62]  To take control of that video.
[2702.20 --> 2707.68]  And then walk out the window and some stuff happens basically.
[2709.52 --> 2711.76]  And you can tell that's not...
[2711.76 --> 2712.08]  Yeah.
[2712.20 --> 2712.52]  Yeah.
[2712.70 --> 2714.30]  You can 100% tell.
[2714.70 --> 2715.66]  Still really interesting.
[2716.12 --> 2720.02]  OpenAI announced their first open weight models since GPT-2.
[2720.48 --> 2727.16]  GPT-OSS 120 billion and GPT-OSS 20 billion are free to download.
[2727.28 --> 2728.58]  OSS is an open source software.
[2728.58 --> 2734.74]  They're Apache licensed and can run on a single GPU or even a laptop despite being open.
[2734.90 --> 2739.42]  They're trained with many of the same techniques as OpenAI's proprietary reasoning models.
[2739.84 --> 2742.84]  And they're performing surprisingly close to the O-series in benchmarks.
[2743.54 --> 2755.48]  OpenAI launched GPT-5, its first unified model combining O-series reasoning with GPT-series speed, plus a router that chooses between quick or thinking responses.
[2755.48 --> 2760.46]  Benchmarks show small gains in coding science and reduced hallucinations.
[2760.86 --> 2764.18]  But a buggy rollout made it seem dumber on day one.
[2764.46 --> 2766.86]  Sparking calls to bring back GPT-4.
[2766.96 --> 2768.12]  Oh, I didn't even know about that.
[2768.40 --> 2769.76]  I'm going to talk about my experience.
[2769.76 --> 2773.88]  I think they need bigger gains in coding based on my experience.
[2774.18 --> 2788.16]  By the way, I don't know if you saw this on the subreddit, but there was a Reddit post that went kind of viral where somebody ran into the exact same thing that I did with chat GPT claiming that it would work on something in the background and then come back.
[2789.00 --> 2789.36]  And...
[2789.36 --> 2790.42]  Was that with 5 though?
[2790.76 --> 2791.62]  No, I don't think so.
[2791.62 --> 2794.40]  I'm just making me think of that.
[2794.48 --> 2796.72]  But yeah, chat GPT do be a liar sometimes.
[2798.54 --> 2800.58]  Yeah, but I have things to...
[2800.58 --> 2801.64]  Should I talk about that now?
[2801.80 --> 2802.82]  Or should we go into the other ones?
[2802.88 --> 2804.16]  You talk about whatever you want, Luke.
[2804.28 --> 2805.50]  You talk about whatever you want.
[2805.52 --> 2806.98]  You put a little space here.
[2807.16 --> 2809.06]  You can talk whatever you want.
[2809.98 --> 2811.48]  GPT-5 last night.
[2811.88 --> 2815.58]  And I ran it against a test that I've been doing for a while.
[2815.62 --> 2816.10]  Where are you now?
[2816.10 --> 2817.52]  This is where I take the...
[2817.52 --> 2821.12]  My goodness.
[2821.90 --> 2824.74]  I take the Wall Street Journal.
[2825.56 --> 2826.14]  Is that it?
[2826.24 --> 2828.42]  Yeah, the Wall Street Journal game called Letterboxd.
[2828.74 --> 2830.80]  And I give it the rules.
[2830.92 --> 2835.04]  I did this with John from the lab.
[2835.22 --> 2835.68]  John Doiren.
[2836.00 --> 2838.72]  I did it with chat GPT 4, I think it was, with him.
[2838.84 --> 2840.72]  And I was trying to get it to actually work.
[2841.08 --> 2842.36]  And it never did.
[2842.40 --> 2843.70]  And I've tried this with a few other models.
[2843.70 --> 2846.02]  Not all of them, but a few other models.
[2846.10 --> 2849.24]  And usually, it can't actually play the game.
[2849.34 --> 2851.50]  The game is basically, there's four sides to a square.
[2851.76 --> 2853.10]  There's three letters on each side.
[2853.24 --> 2859.92]  And you need to use up all of the letters, making various words, by doing as few words
[2859.92 --> 2860.88]  as you possibly can.
[2862.14 --> 2865.24]  And the problem is, you can't go to the same side again.
[2865.48 --> 2867.44]  You have to go from different side to different side.
[2867.96 --> 2871.12]  And it would sometimes make up letters that weren't there.
[2871.12 --> 2874.98]  It would, most often, it would go back to the same side too many times.
[2874.98 --> 2875.98]  It would break the rules.
[2876.04 --> 2877.22]  And it couldn't actually play the game.
[2878.48 --> 2884.10]  I got the standard GPT 5 to be able to beat it.
[2884.78 --> 2888.32]  It recognized, it attempted to do it.
[2888.74 --> 2889.96]  And it cheated.
[2890.24 --> 2891.58]  It went to the same side too many times.
[2891.62 --> 2892.40]  So I called it out.
[2892.94 --> 2895.06]  And it accepted that.
[2895.12 --> 2897.28]  And then it tried again and failed.
[2897.28 --> 2901.00]  And gave me an output saying, I failed to do this.
[2901.34 --> 2903.08]  This is why it was hard for me to do.
[2904.58 --> 2907.08]  And then it was like, do you want me to keep trying?
[2907.86 --> 2909.26]  And I was like, yeah, keep trying.
[2909.46 --> 2911.54]  And it tried again and it failed again.
[2912.04 --> 2913.34]  Explained why it was hard.
[2913.54 --> 2915.60]  And explained what it would need to do.
[2916.18 --> 2918.96]  And it was like, basically, I'm going to have to write a program to do this.
[2918.96 --> 2925.16]  Because my model has an issue with location persistence and all this other kind of stuff.
[2925.38 --> 2926.56]  So I am too limited.
[2926.70 --> 2930.12]  But I can write code to solve this for you if you want.
[2930.74 --> 2931.58]  So I said, sure.
[2931.94 --> 2935.78]  And it output a Python script that just one-shot it.
[2936.24 --> 2936.58]  Really?
[2937.70 --> 2939.40]  So that was very interesting.
[2939.98 --> 2943.04]  And then I was sitting with Theo.
[2943.12 --> 2944.70]  And he was like, oh, try the reasoning model.
[2944.98 --> 2945.90]  See what happens there.
[2945.90 --> 2948.94]  So I switched from the standard model to the reasoning model.
[2949.22 --> 2950.72]  And it took a long time.
[2951.02 --> 2953.12]  But it just right off the hop, one-shot it.
[2953.46 --> 2957.36]  And it actually solved it in five words.
[2958.38 --> 2960.78]  And the challenge was do it in five words or less.
[2960.94 --> 2962.14]  It solved it in five words.
[2962.26 --> 2964.52]  But as I was inputting them to make sure that it worked,
[2965.00 --> 2967.34]  I realized that it actually finished on the fourth word.
[2968.40 --> 2970.22]  So it found a fifth extra word.
[2970.68 --> 2974.56]  And then it was like, I can probably do better if you want me to try.
[2974.56 --> 2977.12]  I called it out and was like, you didn't need the fifth word.
[2977.18 --> 2977.84]  And it was like, yeah.
[2978.34 --> 2983.12]  And then in response, it was like, I think I can do fewer words if you want.
[2983.70 --> 2984.76]  And I was like, yeah, go for it.
[2984.78 --> 2985.66]  And it sat for a while.
[2985.74 --> 2986.62]  And then it did it in three.
[2989.62 --> 2993.00]  So that was actually pretty crazy to me.
[2994.38 --> 2995.40]  That was pretty nuts.
[2995.94 --> 2999.66]  But isn't that the AGI thing, being able to improve itself?
[2999.80 --> 3001.96]  No, I completely disagree.
[3002.34 --> 3003.40]  No, not even a little.
[3003.40 --> 3008.22]  The big difference that Theo and I were talking about,
[3008.26 --> 3013.42]  he was proposing that the big difference is that it was a change in alignment,
[3013.42 --> 3016.88]  which might actually make it hallucinate less, which is interesting.
[3017.52 --> 3018.38]  A change in alignment.
[3018.52 --> 3019.44]  You're going to have to define.
[3020.64 --> 3026.18]  So basically in the past, there was a lot of rules that tried to make it stop,
[3026.84 --> 3028.90]  tried to stop it from doing certain things, right?
[3028.90 --> 3033.54]  And you could work around those rules.
[3033.54 --> 3037.96]  But a lot of times, it would just kind of like make stuff up to get around.
[3038.40 --> 3039.72]  You would ask it something.
[3040.46 --> 3042.50]  You would ask it to go from point A to point B.
[3042.66 --> 3042.86]  Yep.
[3042.86 --> 3047.22]  And it would like go to many other points in between to try to solve a bunch of problems
[3047.22 --> 3048.46]  that you haven't actually really asked for yet.
[3048.52 --> 3050.30]  Like it was like over eager almost.
[3051.18 --> 3056.96]  And it would try to work around what you asked it to do and add a bunch of stuff.
[3057.06 --> 3059.80]  And it kind of went out of scope very often.
[3059.94 --> 3060.86]  It would tangent really hard.
[3060.94 --> 3062.02]  It would go out of scope really often.
[3062.02 --> 3063.94]  I'm sure you experienced this doing your coding thing.
[3064.12 --> 3064.22]  Yep.
[3065.46 --> 3067.22]  And now it's a bit more strict.
[3067.40 --> 3070.70]  It seems to stick closer to what you asked for.
[3071.26 --> 3075.34]  And when it can't do it, the change here, the reason why that person is asking,
[3075.58 --> 3076.40]  is it an AGI thing?
[3076.52 --> 3080.02]  The change here is that it's quicker to propose alternatives
[3080.02 --> 3084.42]  instead of trying to work around automatically.
[3084.70 --> 3085.16]  Or pretending.
[3085.58 --> 3088.14]  So there's proposed alternative or pretending or whatever.
[3088.36 --> 3091.88]  So like before, I couldn't get it to do it because it would just keep breaking the rules.
[3091.88 --> 3093.96]  And when I would point out that it broke the rule, it would just be like,
[3094.02 --> 3094.58]  ah, you're right.
[3094.64 --> 3095.66]  And then it would break the rule again.
[3096.08 --> 3096.16]  Yeah.
[3096.92 --> 3101.28]  And now instead of just like hammering its face into the wall, it will go,
[3101.50 --> 3103.76]  okay, yeah, I broke the rules here.
[3104.36 --> 3105.46]  You caught me on it.
[3105.48 --> 3107.94]  And then I broke the rules again, caught myself on it.
[3108.38 --> 3109.64]  We need another solution.
[3109.72 --> 3110.88]  I don't seem to be able to do this.
[3111.18 --> 3112.70]  Here's another way that I could approach it.
[3112.74 --> 3112.98]  Right.
[3113.08 --> 3114.40]  Writing a program to do it for you.
[3116.12 --> 3117.58]  And then it did it.
[3118.02 --> 3119.46]  By the way, here's the...
[3119.46 --> 3120.32]  Interesting and probably more useful.
[3120.56 --> 3121.86]  Here's the...
[3121.88 --> 3123.90]  The sort of viral post, I found it.
[3124.88 --> 3126.90]  This is on r slash chat GPT.
[3127.04 --> 3128.12]  Caught chat GPT lying.
[3128.66 --> 3130.90]  Had a very strange interaction over the course of 24 hours.
[3131.02 --> 3132.64]  In short, it strung me along the entire time,
[3132.74 --> 3135.12]  all while lying about its capabilities and what it was doing.
[3135.64 --> 3138.34]  It was to help me write code and generate some assets for a project.
[3138.56 --> 3140.14]  Told me it would take 24 hours to complete.
[3140.58 --> 3142.04]  24 hours later, I asked for an update.
[3142.12 --> 3143.94]  It said it was done and would generate a download link.
[3144.10 --> 3145.06]  No download link worked.
[3145.42 --> 3147.40]  After 10 attempts of faulty download links,
[3147.40 --> 3150.90]  it admitted it never had the capabilities in the first place to create a download link.
[3150.90 --> 3153.38]  Furthermore, I asked what it had been working on this entire time.
[3153.60 --> 3154.32]  Turns out nothing.
[3154.86 --> 3157.82]  And lastly, after some back and forth, it admitted to lying.
[3157.94 --> 3160.38]  I asked why and it essentially said it was to keep me happy.
[3160.66 --> 3161.72]  This is a huge problem.
[3163.18 --> 3163.92]  So, hopefully...
[3163.92 --> 3164.56]  Hopefully...
[3164.56 --> 3166.66]  As far as my understanding goes, it should do less of that.
[3166.70 --> 3168.62]  So, hopefully, they have fixed this.
[3170.38 --> 3172.36]  Yeah, because there's been alignment changes.
[3172.44 --> 3174.68]  So, it should help with less of that,
[3174.76 --> 3177.84]  which comes across as a hallucination problem because it is,
[3177.96 --> 3181.62]  but it's a hallucination problem because they're, like, incentivizing it to...
[3181.62 --> 3182.94]  Make you happy.
[3183.10 --> 3183.54]  ...to a particular thing.
[3183.88 --> 3184.10]  Yeah.
[3184.22 --> 3184.40]  Yeah.
[3184.48 --> 3185.84]  Whereas I don't want to be happy.
[3185.92 --> 3186.58]  I want...
[3186.58 --> 3187.56]  I want the truth.
[3187.62 --> 3188.44]  I want the real answer.
[3188.44 --> 3190.30]  So, hopefully, it'll be better.
[3190.38 --> 3192.22]  It is still hallucinating things.
[3192.72 --> 3196.46]  I ran it through some stuff just to try to see if it would screw up,
[3196.50 --> 3197.86]  and it still absolutely does.
[3197.96 --> 3199.40]  The hallucination problem is not solved.
[3199.40 --> 3205.70]  But in my kind of, like, my version of tea leaf reading,
[3206.10 --> 3209.04]  it does seem a little bit better at the hallucination stuff,
[3209.06 --> 3211.58]  and it seems, like, probably because of the alignment changes.
[3212.44 --> 3213.00]  Interesting.
[3213.92 --> 3214.48]  Yeah.
[3216.60 --> 3217.16]  Yeah.
[3217.40 --> 3219.04]  It's an interesting time.
[3219.36 --> 3220.50]  This is...
[3220.50 --> 3224.42]  I'm surprised that the notes in the doc seem pretty tepid on it,
[3224.74 --> 3228.42]  likely because of the buggy rollout that they mentioned,
[3228.42 --> 3231.98]  because most people that I've talked to about it are very impressed,
[3232.30 --> 3236.32]  not necessarily because, like, oh, my God, it's so capable,
[3237.10 --> 3239.32]  but because it messes around less,
[3239.52 --> 3244.86]  and they're able to get the thing that they actually want out of it
[3244.86 --> 3249.44]  without it lying to them quite as much.
[3249.58 --> 3250.36]  Like, I really...
[3250.36 --> 3252.46]  I've been talking about this on Wancho for a long time.
[3252.64 --> 3254.78]  I really think the biggest problem with all these systems
[3254.78 --> 3256.88]  is the hallucinations.
[3256.88 --> 3262.42]  And even a marginal improvement there,
[3262.68 --> 3265.12]  which is, like, this absolutely did not solve the problem,
[3265.44 --> 3267.00]  but it feels like a marginal improvement,
[3267.08 --> 3268.96]  and even a marginal improvement there is a pretty big deal.
[3269.48 --> 3270.76]  Like, there's...
[3270.76 --> 3273.92]  It's pretty common in conversations with other people to...
[3273.92 --> 3276.20]  For people to bring up, like, oh, yeah, there's a model that's better.
[3277.30 --> 3278.60]  It's, like, it tests better.
[3278.74 --> 3280.56]  It is realistically a better model,
[3280.56 --> 3285.32]  but it hallucinates like crazy and is, like, difficult to interact with.
[3285.42 --> 3287.36]  So I don't like using it.
[3288.26 --> 3291.42]  And this seems like a good step in the...
[3291.42 --> 3295.24]  It's more functional to interact with realm, in my opinion.
[3296.24 --> 3297.34]  Hey, hold on a second.
[3297.62 --> 3303.20]  Dan just put a merch message just through the bottom here
[3303.20 --> 3307.32]  where apparently someone gave you a DualSense controller at LTX
[3307.32 --> 3310.04]  and asked if you've reached a conclusion about it.
[3310.36 --> 3313.30]  How did you not have a controller all those times
[3313.30 --> 3314.60]  when we were playing tape-to-tape
[3314.60 --> 3316.08]  if someone gave you a DualSense?
[3320.08 --> 3320.72]  Uh...
[3320.72 --> 3323.34]  I don't think I have a DualSense controller.
[3325.62 --> 3326.38]  Uh...
[3326.38 --> 3331.88]  Is it possible I'm completely missing something here?
[3335.30 --> 3336.86]  I vaguely remember this,
[3337.10 --> 3339.14]  but I don't think I have it.
[3339.22 --> 3340.14]  Do you not have it?
[3340.14 --> 3340.60]  It's probably at work.
[3340.74 --> 3341.60]  What happened to it?
[3341.60 --> 3341.82]  It's probably at work.
[3342.36 --> 3343.24]  It's probably at work.
[3343.34 --> 3346.46]  Okay, well, Cameron wants to know if you like it or hate it,
[3346.52 --> 3348.80]  so you should probably take it home and let Cameron know.
[3348.80 --> 3350.94]  No, I think the answer would have probably been
[3350.94 --> 3352.20]  that I did not like it.
[3354.44 --> 3355.22]  Alright, then.
[3355.30 --> 3356.50]  Because I probably just, like,
[3357.62 --> 3358.92]  tried it and was like,
[3359.02 --> 3359.76]  yep, confirmed.
[3359.96 --> 3361.28]  I really do not like
[3361.28 --> 3364.10]  when the thumbsticks are both down here
[3364.10 --> 3366.44]  and then probably just brought it to work.
[3366.50 --> 3367.50]  That's funny, because I actually,
[3367.72 --> 3368.30]  in spite of that,
[3368.34 --> 3369.38]  I quite like the DualSense.
[3369.58 --> 3372.92]  I still use an Xbox controller,
[3373.38 --> 3375.48]  but I do like the DualSense.
[3376.26 --> 3378.12]  The offset analog sticks,
[3378.12 --> 3379.04]  whatever those are called,
[3379.22 --> 3380.28]  is just, I can't,
[3381.82 --> 3383.20]  nothing else does it for me.
[3384.96 --> 3387.18]  I don't actually technically use
[3387.18 --> 3388.50]  an Xbox controller at home,
[3389.22 --> 3391.40]  but I use a controller that is, like,
[3391.46 --> 3393.46]  very much modeled after an Xbox controller.
[3393.54 --> 3393.68]  Yeah.
[3394.10 --> 3395.50]  And it just,
[3396.16 --> 3398.38]  it's great.
[3398.56 --> 3398.84]  Dan.
[3399.06 --> 3399.30]  I can't,
[3399.54 --> 3401.94]  I'm remembering more of this now.
[3402.00 --> 3402.94]  I did try it.
[3403.12 --> 3403.50]  It just,
[3403.62 --> 3404.40]  I didn't try it
[3404.40 --> 3405.12]  much.
[3405.12 --> 3405.72]  much.
[3405.72 --> 3406.72]  For that long.
[3407.30 --> 3408.20]  I tried it with,
[3408.24 --> 3408.82]  I think it was
[3408.82 --> 3410.38]  Forza 5 Horizons,
[3410.78 --> 3412.42]  and then it was just like,
[3412.52 --> 3412.74]  ugh,
[3413.26 --> 3414.20]  and tried it for, like,
[3414.22 --> 3414.96]  I think a couple days,
[3415.04 --> 3415.40]  and then,
[3415.70 --> 3415.86]  yeah,
[3415.96 --> 3417.32]  I suspect it's at work now,
[3417.38 --> 3418.72]  because I don't have it at home anymore,
[3418.88 --> 3419.72]  but I didn't sell it.
[3419.82 --> 3420.02]  Dan,
[3420.06 --> 3420.28]  you gotta,
[3420.38 --> 3422.12]  you gotta actually read people's messages.
[3422.24 --> 3422.44]  Yeah,
[3422.50 --> 3423.42]  I'm so sorry about that.
[3423.42 --> 3423.66]  Hey, Luke,
[3423.70 --> 3424.68]  have you come to a conclusion
[3424.68 --> 3425.98]  on the DualSense controller yet?
[3426.04 --> 3427.50]  I gave you one at LTX LAN,
[3427.56 --> 3428.06]  and I just wanna know
[3428.06 --> 3428.92]  if you like it or hate it.
[3428.98 --> 3429.96]  I missed that middle bit.
[3429.96 --> 3431.48]  Wait for the PS6.
[3435.26 --> 3435.62]  Wait,
[3435.74 --> 3436.02]  what?
[3436.34 --> 3437.68]  I misread the comment.
[3437.80 --> 3438.34]  I'm so sorry.
[3439.22 --> 3439.58]  Okay.
[3440.20 --> 3440.56]  Apologies.
[3440.60 --> 3441.88]  He ran it through chat GPT,
[3441.96 --> 3443.02]  and he forgot to use 5.
[3443.74 --> 3443.98]  Yeah.
[3445.04 --> 3446.20]  You're only worth 4 mini.
[3446.26 --> 3446.94]  I'll work on this
[3446.94 --> 3447.58]  in the background,
[3447.82 --> 3448.72]  and I'll get back to you
[3448.72 --> 3449.70]  in 24 hours.
[3450.06 --> 3451.18]  I got better things to do.
[3452.66 --> 3453.42]  Sorry about that.
[3453.42 --> 3453.58]  Yeah,
[3453.58 --> 3454.00]  I do,
[3454.06 --> 3455.06]  I do remember this now,
[3455.06 --> 3456.02]  and I'm fairly certain
[3456.02 --> 3457.06]  it was Forza Horizon 5
[3457.06 --> 3457.80]  that I used it with,
[3458.16 --> 3460.18]  and I did try to give it a real shot,
[3460.28 --> 3460.74]  but honestly,
[3460.92 --> 3461.88]  the conclusion was
[3461.88 --> 3463.76]  gotten to rather quickly.
[3463.98 --> 3464.32]  I just,
[3464.46 --> 3465.10]  I really don't,
[3465.38 --> 3466.94]  this position for my hands
[3466.94 --> 3468.12]  is not cool.
[3468.22 --> 3468.66]  I get it.
[3469.40 --> 3470.06]  I don't,
[3470.08 --> 3470.94]  I don't like it.
[3471.58 --> 3472.80]  How hard do you think
[3472.80 --> 3473.56]  it would be?
[3473.68 --> 3474.28]  Like if,
[3474.44 --> 3474.60]  okay,
[3474.64 --> 3475.84]  on a week like this week,
[3475.84 --> 3477.24]  I think Dan can probably
[3477.24 --> 3479.30]  reply to everyone directly,
[3479.48 --> 3480.76]  but on weeks when we have
[3480.76 --> 3481.82]  like a major launch,
[3481.82 --> 3482.72]  how hard would it be
[3482.72 --> 3483.46]  to train,
[3483.46 --> 3485.54]  train up a model
[3485.54 --> 3486.92]  on like every past
[3486.92 --> 3487.88]  WAN show transcript?
[3488.22 --> 3489.18]  I actually tried to do that.
[3489.38 --> 3489.84]  Did you?
[3490.04 --> 3490.24]  Yeah.
[3490.36 --> 3490.98]  How'd that go?
[3491.68 --> 3492.60]  Not great,
[3492.60 --> 3493.82]  because you have to
[3493.82 --> 3495.02]  design call and response
[3495.02 --> 3495.76]  for every single
[3495.76 --> 3496.40]  merch message,
[3496.76 --> 3498.08]  but you also need
[3498.08 --> 3498.78]  a way to indicate
[3498.78 --> 3500.02]  if it's shown,
[3500.24 --> 3500.60]  curated,
[3500.84 --> 3501.92]  or archived,
[3502.04 --> 3503.04]  and it's very difficult
[3503.04 --> 3505.04]  to do that organically.
[3507.00 --> 3507.44]  No,
[3507.44 --> 3508.10]  but I would imagine
[3508.10 --> 3508.48]  that would be
[3508.48 --> 3509.34]  the human intervention
[3509.34 --> 3510.04]  at that point.
[3511.32 --> 3512.24]  Yes and no.
[3512.24 --> 3512.78]  I mean,
[3513.12 --> 3514.02]  we want it to respond.
[3514.40 --> 3514.96]  Is there another button?
[3515.82 --> 3516.22]  I don't think
[3516.22 --> 3516.76]  we should do this,
[3516.84 --> 3517.48]  but I think the,
[3517.52 --> 3519.26]  the thing to do
[3519.26 --> 3520.60]  could be having a button
[3520.60 --> 3521.70]  that is AI response.
[3522.08 --> 3522.82]  The problem is that
[3522.82 --> 3525.98]  most of the responses,
[3526.52 --> 3527.22]  I mean,
[3527.32 --> 3527.52]  yeah,
[3527.52 --> 3527.80]  sure,
[3528.08 --> 3528.30]  maybe.
[3528.44 --> 3528.62]  No,
[3528.70 --> 3529.38]  it would have to be,
[3529.46 --> 3529.58]  no,
[3529.64 --> 3530.10]  it would have to be
[3530.10 --> 3531.28]  the AI response
[3531.28 --> 3532.54]  goes to a human
[3532.54 --> 3534.36]  and then a human decides
[3534.36 --> 3535.84]  if the AI got it right.
[3536.00 --> 3536.16]  Yeah,
[3536.20 --> 3537.10]  like it could show up.
[3537.10 --> 3537.32]  But then that's probably
[3537.32 --> 3538.40]  more work than for someone.
[3538.40 --> 3538.78]  It could show up
[3538.78 --> 3539.42]  in the bottom
[3539.42 --> 3540.26]  of my text box.
[3540.26 --> 3541.00]  I'm just reading it
[3541.00 --> 3541.72]  and evaluating.
[3541.72 --> 3541.92]  Yeah,
[3542.06 --> 3542.56]  what's the point?
[3542.60 --> 3543.04]  It's probably,
[3543.38 --> 3544.26]  for someone who types
[3544.26 --> 3545.48]  as quickly as any one
[3545.48 --> 3546.32]  of the three of us,
[3546.36 --> 3547.70]  it's probably less work
[3547.70 --> 3548.92]  to just type the response
[3548.92 --> 3549.48]  at that point.
[3549.88 --> 3550.58]  I feel like,
[3550.82 --> 3551.60]  I feel like,
[3552.22 --> 3552.44]  yeah,
[3552.56 --> 3553.44]  AI is in,
[3553.54 --> 3554.30]  it has this like
[3554.30 --> 3555.18]  this sweet spot
[3555.18 --> 3556.60]  where your brain
[3556.60 --> 3557.46]  moves faster
[3557.46 --> 3558.18]  than your fingers
[3558.18 --> 3559.66]  and then if your fingers
[3559.66 --> 3560.38]  move as fast
[3560.38 --> 3561.00]  as your brain,
[3561.16 --> 3562.76]  then it just kind of,
[3562.76 --> 3565.02]  it doesn't really
[3565.02 --> 3566.62]  do as much for me.
[3566.82 --> 3567.02]  Hey,
[3567.22 --> 3568.30]  speaking of mice
[3568.30 --> 3568.88]  and keyboards
[3568.88 --> 3569.96]  being obsolete,
[3570.48 --> 3571.58]  should we move on
[3571.58 --> 3573.44]  to discussing
[3573.44 --> 3574.70]  how mice
[3574.70 --> 3575.18]  and keyboards
[3575.18 --> 3575.90]  are going away
[3575.90 --> 3576.44]  or did you want
[3576.44 --> 3576.98]  to finish up
[3576.98 --> 3578.38]  the AI news
[3578.38 --> 3578.84]  for the week?
[3579.56 --> 3580.30]  I guess there's
[3580.30 --> 3580.82]  still more there,
[3580.92 --> 3581.18]  but yeah,
[3581.24 --> 3581.58]  I think,
[3581.68 --> 3582.84]  I think to me,
[3583.06 --> 3583.54]  personally,
[3584.02 --> 3585.18]  five is much more
[3585.18 --> 3585.88]  interesting than
[3585.88 --> 3587.76]  four ever was
[3587.76 --> 3588.50]  and I know people
[3588.50 --> 3588.94]  are talking about
[3588.94 --> 3589.10]  how four.
[3589.10 --> 3589.32]  Would you say
[3589.32 --> 3590.80]  it's 25% more interesting
[3590.80 --> 3591.86]  than four ever was?
[3592.76 --> 3594.76]  Yeah,
[3597.18 --> 3597.42]  maybe,
[3597.84 --> 3598.78]  but I don't think
[3598.78 --> 3600.34]  that four was
[3600.34 --> 3601.60]  33% more interesting
[3601.60 --> 3602.10]  than three,
[3602.28 --> 3602.60]  so.
[3603.46 --> 3603.90]  Okay,
[3604.10 --> 3604.56]  so the math
[3604.56 --> 3605.00]  falls apart
[3605.00 --> 3605.50]  a little bit,
[3605.56 --> 3605.84]  but hey,
[3605.90 --> 3606.56]  that's what we expect
[3606.56 --> 3607.08]  from an AI.
[3608.72 --> 3609.20]  Yeah,
[3609.50 --> 3609.84]  yeah,
[3609.88 --> 3610.22]  perfect,
[3610.80 --> 3612.30]  because four
[3612.30 --> 3613.16]  seemed like
[3613.16 --> 3614.50]  an improved
[3614.50 --> 3615.26]  but kind of
[3615.26 --> 3616.34]  samey thing
[3616.34 --> 3616.98]  in my opinion.
[3620.36 --> 3621.18]  Five is,
[3621.24 --> 3621.74]  is,
[3621.74 --> 3622.74]  is,
[3622.76 --> 3623.10]  yeah,
[3623.18 --> 3623.50]  a little bit
[3623.50 --> 3624.08]  more shippable,
[3624.36 --> 3624.72]  I think.
[3625.22 --> 3625.54]  Anthropic
[3625.54 --> 3626.82]  announced Cloud
[3626.82 --> 3627.98]  Opus 4.1
[3627.98 --> 3628.72]  focused on coding
[3628.72 --> 3629.14]  research
[3629.14 --> 3630.36]  and agentic reasoning.
[3630.86 --> 3631.16]  Benchmarks
[3631.16 --> 3631.86]  show noticeable
[3631.86 --> 3632.30]  improvements
[3632.30 --> 3633.20]  in multi-file
[3633.20 --> 3633.76]  refactoring
[3633.76 --> 3634.38]  and pinpoint
[3634.38 --> 3634.90]  debugging
[3634.90 --> 3635.42]  without adding
[3635.42 --> 3635.86]  new bugs.
[3636.26 --> 3637.32]  And Eleven Labs
[3637.32 --> 3639.06]  launched Eleven Music,
[3639.54 --> 3640.56]  an AI used
[3640.56 --> 3641.20]  to generate
[3641.20 --> 3642.14]  studio-grade music
[3642.14 --> 3642.82]  in any style
[3642.82 --> 3643.34]  with or without
[3643.34 --> 3644.10]  vocals in multiple
[3644.10 --> 3644.56]  languages.
[3645.18 --> 3645.82]  Nearly all
[3645.82 --> 3646.48]  commercial uses
[3646.48 --> 3646.96]  are cleared.
[3647.26 --> 3647.70]  Oh,
[3648.06 --> 3648.56]  good.
[3649.00 --> 3649.62]  You can listen
[3649.62 --> 3650.48]  to some examples
[3650.48 --> 3650.80]  here.
[3650.80 --> 3651.28]  Would you like
[3651.28 --> 3651.62]  to listen
[3651.62 --> 3652.34]  to an example,
[3652.54 --> 3652.68]  Luke?
[3653.52 --> 3653.96]  Yeah,
[3654.02 --> 3654.42]  I'll bring it
[3654.42 --> 3654.90]  up myself,
[3655.06 --> 3655.20]  too.
[3655.98 --> 3656.42]  Okay,
[3656.96 --> 3657.50]  so I'm gonna...
[3657.50 --> 3657.86]  So I really
[3657.86 --> 3658.42]  question the
[3658.42 --> 3659.10]  studio quality.
[3660.34 --> 3661.14]  Listening to the
[3661.14 --> 3662.08]  examples doesn't
[3662.08 --> 3662.88]  make me question
[3662.88 --> 3663.76]  it any less.
[3664.34 --> 3664.78]  Dan,
[3664.90 --> 3665.20]  am I,
[3665.20 --> 3665.76]  am I cleared
[3665.76 --> 3666.14]  for,
[3666.40 --> 3667.60]  for audio off?
[3667.60 --> 3670.82]  I can't hear
[3670.82 --> 3671.22]  myself.
[3673.88 --> 3674.24]  Cool.
[3674.34 --> 3674.46]  Well,
[3674.48 --> 3674.78]  I've listened
[3674.78 --> 3675.26]  to it already,
[3675.36 --> 3677.14]  so...
[3677.14 --> 3678.10]  my heart,
[3678.18 --> 3678.92]  a weary
[3678.92 --> 3680.38]  one run-o.
[3680.38 --> 3682.20]  Through shadows
[3682.20 --> 3683.92]  deep and twilight
[3683.92 --> 3684.60]  cold,
[3684.94 --> 3685.60]  I bear
[3685.60 --> 3686.46]  more longing
[3686.46 --> 3688.38]  silent hold.
[3688.38 --> 3707.48]  Yeah,
[3707.72 --> 3709.38]  so...
[3709.38 --> 3711.86]  technically,
[3712.30 --> 3713.74]  you could make
[3713.74 --> 3714.66]  that in a studio,
[3715.16 --> 3716.84]  but you wouldn't.
[3716.84 --> 3718.08]  Yeah,
[3718.22 --> 3718.78]  I think that's
[3718.78 --> 3719.38]  the problem.
[3720.32 --> 3720.62]  Yeah.
[3721.96 --> 3722.44]  Yeah,
[3722.54 --> 3723.90]  that's a...
[3723.90 --> 3724.56]  neat.
[3725.42 --> 3725.76]  Now,
[3725.84 --> 3726.36]  hear me out,
[3726.44 --> 3726.88]  hear me out.
[3726.98 --> 3727.40]  How about
[3727.40 --> 3728.56]  Yellow Bus Jam?
[3728.56 --> 3731.48]  Okay,
[3731.72 --> 3732.26]  we going for some
[3732.26 --> 3733.00]  Beatles or what?
[3736.22 --> 3736.50]  No,
[3736.58 --> 3736.94]  Groovier.
[3736.94 --> 3738.02]  Big Yellow Bus
[3738.02 --> 3739.36]  rolling down
[3739.36 --> 3740.94]  Broadway's cold.
[3743.68 --> 3744.94]  Window down
[3744.94 --> 3746.90]  when the summer song
[3746.90 --> 3749.04]  city arms
[3749.04 --> 3749.92]  keep the beat
[3749.92 --> 3750.96]  all day long
[3750.96 --> 3752.40]  from Harlem
[3752.40 --> 3753.06]  down
[3753.06 --> 3754.26]  to Union Square
[3754.26 --> 3756.16]  and
[3756.16 --> 3757.32]  you can...
[3757.32 --> 3757.96]  Something's still
[3757.96 --> 3758.34]  wrong.
[3758.44 --> 3759.20]  You can feel it.
[3765.38 --> 3767.30]  IX of N724
[3767.30 --> 3768.24]  and floatplane chess.
[3768.36 --> 3768.68]  Okay,
[3769.08 --> 3770.32]  this sucks.
[3771.38 --> 3771.68]  Yeah.
[3771.88 --> 3772.26]  You guys
[3772.26 --> 3772.86]  hadn't heard
[3772.86 --> 3773.60]  suck yet.
[3774.46 --> 3775.44]  The voice is
[3775.44 --> 3775.80]  impressive
[3775.80 --> 3776.24]  because a lot
[3776.24 --> 3776.90]  of AI voices
[3776.90 --> 3777.72]  have that problem
[3777.72 --> 3778.24]  where they have
[3778.24 --> 3778.68]  the, like,
[3779.02 --> 3779.90]  they're hyper
[3779.90 --> 3780.50]  monotone
[3780.50 --> 3781.02]  about anything
[3781.02 --> 3782.46]  because the second
[3782.46 --> 3783.16]  they show any
[3783.16 --> 3783.98]  inflection
[3783.98 --> 3784.66]  or emotion
[3784.66 --> 3786.20]  it could be
[3786.20 --> 3786.88]  unaligned
[3786.88 --> 3787.80]  and that's a
[3787.80 --> 3788.50]  bigger giveaway
[3788.50 --> 3789.14]  than them just
[3789.14 --> 3790.16]  being hyper monotone.
[3790.64 --> 3791.84]  So it's interesting
[3791.84 --> 3792.42]  that they actually
[3792.42 --> 3792.94]  have some, like,
[3793.02 --> 3793.88]  emotion in the singing
[3793.88 --> 3794.78]  that is seemingly
[3794.78 --> 3795.42]  pretty good.
[3795.86 --> 3796.78]  Twill923 says
[3796.78 --> 3797.96]  a soul song
[3797.96 --> 3798.98]  with no soul.
[3799.64 --> 3799.78]  Yeah,
[3799.86 --> 3800.88]  exactly.
[3801.00 --> 3801.42]  Pretty much.
[3801.44 --> 3801.78]  It really
[3801.78 --> 3803.32]  was notably lacking.
[3803.72 --> 3804.36]  Hold on,
[3804.40 --> 3804.94]  who was it?
[3805.06 --> 3805.98]  I'm sitting here
[3805.98 --> 3806.88]  with a guitar
[3806.88 --> 3808.28]  and can't find
[3808.28 --> 3809.10]  the beat still.
[3809.22 --> 3809.52]  Hold on,
[3809.56 --> 3810.38]  who was this?
[3811.18 --> 3812.74]  I can't find it.
[3812.82 --> 3813.00]  I mean,
[3813.06 --> 3813.32]  okay,
[3813.40 --> 3814.14]  so this is fair,
[3814.22 --> 3814.34]  though.
[3814.40 --> 3814.92]  This is fair.
[3815.34 --> 3816.08]  Travow says
[3816.08 --> 3817.00]  there are plenty
[3817.00 --> 3817.80]  of real songs
[3817.80 --> 3819.02]  that are way worse,
[3819.12 --> 3819.30]  though.
[3819.72 --> 3819.84]  Oh,
[3819.86 --> 3820.46]  it was Gilmore D
[3820.46 --> 3820.88]  who said
[3820.88 --> 3822.54]  the beat's very weird.
[3822.80 --> 3824.04]  Can't find the feel.
[3825.84 --> 3826.24]  Yeah,
[3826.48 --> 3826.74]  yeah.
[3827.28 --> 3828.16]  It's the kind
[3828.16 --> 3828.74]  of thing
[3828.74 --> 3831.34]  that I wouldn't
[3831.34 --> 3832.58]  notice if I wasn't
[3832.58 --> 3833.78]  actively listening,
[3834.24 --> 3835.06]  if that makes sense.
[3835.20 --> 3835.40]  Like,
[3835.46 --> 3836.60]  if I was in a restaurant
[3836.60 --> 3837.88]  and this was on
[3837.88 --> 3838.44]  in the background,
[3838.78 --> 3839.94]  I wouldn't,
[3839.94 --> 3841.46]  I wouldn't
[3841.46 --> 3843.02]  notice it.
[3843.50 --> 3844.30]  I would,
[3844.62 --> 3846.04]  I wouldn't be like,
[3846.58 --> 3848.34]  how dare they?
[3848.52 --> 3848.70]  Like,
[3848.72 --> 3849.30]  it wouldn't be like
[3849.30 --> 3850.50]  that wedding I went to
[3850.50 --> 3851.56]  where they played
[3851.56 --> 3853.08]  Flowers from Miley Cyrus
[3853.08 --> 3853.84]  and I was like,
[3854.04 --> 3854.36]  wow,
[3855.18 --> 3856.10]  wildly inappropriate
[3856.10 --> 3857.94]  for like,
[3858.04 --> 3859.42]  the second song
[3859.42 --> 3860.16]  of the dance.
[3860.70 --> 3860.78]  Like,
[3861.50 --> 3862.44]  like,
[3862.44 --> 3865.18]  it was a human DJ.
[3865.38 --> 3865.74]  Literally,
[3866.50 --> 3867.46]  I wish they were
[3867.46 --> 3868.26]  replaced by an AI
[3868.26 --> 3868.82]  at that point
[3868.82 --> 3869.52]  because you can't
[3869.52 --> 3869.98]  do that.
[3870.46 --> 3871.22]  That's just
[3871.22 --> 3872.46]  so inappropriate.
[3873.00 --> 3874.08]  So it wasn't like that.
[3876.08 --> 3876.60]  Yeah,
[3876.74 --> 3877.52]  Pug Boy says
[3877.52 --> 3878.46]  that's an insane
[3878.46 --> 3879.50]  choice for a wedding.
[3880.00 --> 3880.44]  Right?
[3881.78 --> 3882.26]  Anyway,
[3882.26 --> 3884.02]  so it wouldn't
[3884.02 --> 3884.74]  drag me out
[3884.74 --> 3885.42]  of the event
[3885.42 --> 3886.78]  but it also,
[3887.00 --> 3887.76]  I wouldn't be like,
[3888.28 --> 3890.08]  I need to get
[3890.08 --> 3891.30]  my sound hound out.
[3892.20 --> 3893.14]  Shazam that.
[3894.02 --> 3894.34]  Like,
[3894.90 --> 3895.72]  I just wouldn't
[3895.72 --> 3896.34]  notice it.
[3897.62 --> 3897.82]  Yeah.
[3897.82 --> 3903.80]  Um,
[3903.98 --> 3905.30]  the unique username
[3905.30 --> 3906.02]  asked why?
[3906.12 --> 3906.38]  What's wrong
[3906.38 --> 3906.98]  with that song?
[3907.60 --> 3908.00]  Um,
[3908.70 --> 3909.08]  and
[3909.08 --> 3910.84]  Moon MMO
[3910.84 --> 3911.38]  says
[3911.38 --> 3912.88]  because it's about
[3912.88 --> 3913.76]  loving yourself
[3913.76 --> 3915.00]  because partners suck.
[3916.58 --> 3917.10]  Absolutely
[3917.10 --> 3918.98]  unhinged
[3918.98 --> 3920.04]  choice for a wedding.
[3921.64 --> 3922.20]  Uh,
[3922.24 --> 3922.88]  Yaxter says
[3922.88 --> 3923.50]  mother-in-law
[3923.50 --> 3924.50]  requested it.
[3926.18 --> 3927.10]  That's pretty funny.
[3927.52 --> 3927.78]  Yeah,
[3927.82 --> 3928.34]  that's pretty good.
[3928.58 --> 3929.18]  That's pretty good.
[3930.08 --> 3930.48]  Um,
[3931.24 --> 3932.54]  does this not require
[3932.54 --> 3933.20]  a public broadcast
[3933.20 --> 3934.26]  license to play in a store
[3934.26 --> 3934.88]  or like,
[3935.10 --> 3935.58]  question mark?
[3935.74 --> 3936.22]  Probably not.
[3936.32 --> 3936.88]  The thing is
[3936.88 --> 3938.04]  that I'm sitting with
[3938.04 --> 3939.20]  is there is already,
[3939.20 --> 3940.30]  um,
[3940.88 --> 3942.52]  tons of royalty-free music.
[3943.58 --> 3944.02]  Yeah,
[3944.16 --> 3944.92]  like real music
[3944.92 --> 3945.62]  by real people.
[3946.44 --> 3947.24]  I'm pretty sure
[3947.24 --> 3947.88]  Crab Rave
[3947.88 --> 3948.64]  is like literally
[3948.64 --> 3949.32]  one of those.
[3950.24 --> 3950.64]  Ah,
[3950.82 --> 3951.00]  no,
[3951.06 --> 3952.24]  I think there's usage
[3952.24 --> 3952.96]  requirements.
[3952.96 --> 3953.40]  Like,
[3953.42 --> 3953.90]  you have to credit
[3953.90 --> 3954.52]  them and stuff.
[3955.84 --> 3956.28]  Yeah,
[3956.32 --> 3957.28]  we also do have
[3957.28 --> 3957.64]  an agreement
[3957.64 --> 3958.46]  with Monster Cat
[3958.46 --> 3959.34]  where we just like
[3959.34 --> 3960.36]  can use all of their stuff
[3960.36 --> 3961.48]  as long as we just credit it.
[3961.88 --> 3963.06]  There are Vancouver bros.
[3966.94 --> 3967.82]  So I don't,
[3967.88 --> 3968.06]  don't,
[3968.10 --> 3968.20]  don't,
[3968.26 --> 3968.46]  I'm,
[3968.46 --> 3970.28]  I'm actually not sure though.
[3970.58 --> 3971.20]  Now he's looking.
[3971.32 --> 3971.52]  Oh no,
[3971.54 --> 3972.48]  it is copyrighted.
[3972.52 --> 3972.64]  Yeah,
[3972.64 --> 3973.58]  it's not royalty-free.
[3973.74 --> 3973.82]  Okay.
[3973.82 --> 3974.00]  Yeah,
[3974.02 --> 3974.58]  so yeah,
[3974.62 --> 3975.04]  let's be careful
[3975.04 --> 3976.42]  that we can use it.
[3976.54 --> 3976.88]  Um,
[3977.00 --> 3977.30]  yes,
[3977.44 --> 3977.62]  yeah,
[3977.62 --> 3977.82]  yeah,
[3977.82 --> 3978.02]  yeah,
[3978.02 --> 3978.40]  yeah.
[3978.40 --> 3978.50]  Yeah.
[3980.72 --> 3981.08]  Interesting.
[3981.08 --> 3982.06]  because I noticed like
[3982.06 --> 3983.72]  a ton of people do.
[3984.88 --> 3985.72]  So I thought,
[3985.82 --> 3986.22]  I thought,
[3986.38 --> 3987.38]  I knew it was originally
[3987.38 --> 3988.76]  copyrighted and we just
[3988.76 --> 3989.54]  had an approval,
[3989.54 --> 3990.16]  but then I've noticed
[3990.16 --> 3991.46]  that it's like universally
[3991.46 --> 3992.24]  used now.
[3992.74 --> 3993.14]  Um,
[3993.60 --> 3994.96]  but I guess either just
[3994.96 --> 3995.74]  people have agreements
[3995.74 --> 3996.34]  or,
[3996.34 --> 3998.08]  uh,
[3998.78 --> 3999.62]  it's fly by night.
[3999.68 --> 4000.48]  I could see either one
[4000.48 --> 4000.90]  to be honest.
[4000.90 --> 4005.14]  Um,
[4005.34 --> 4007.62]  okay,
[4007.70 --> 4008.92]  the last bit here is
[4008.92 --> 4010.60]  Elon Musk says that
[4010.60 --> 4012.18]  Twitter will put ads
[4012.18 --> 4014.32]  in Grok's chatbot answers,
[4014.86 --> 4015.84]  meaning that advertisers
[4015.84 --> 4017.24]  could pay to have their product
[4017.24 --> 4018.84]  be the ideal solution
[4018.84 --> 4020.06]  that Grok suggests.
[4023.58 --> 4025.50]  Talk about saying the quiet part
[4025.50 --> 4026.02]  out loud.
[4026.38 --> 4026.40]  Um,
[4026.40 --> 4026.76]  Musk says,
[4026.76 --> 4026.92]  yeah,
[4026.98 --> 4027.76]  we all knew it was going
[4027.76 --> 4028.14]  that direction.
[4028.18 --> 4028.74]  Musk says,
[4028.82 --> 4029.60]  this will help pay
[4029.60 --> 4031.02]  for those expensive GPUs.
[4031.06 --> 4031.58]  That's a quote.
[4032.12 --> 4032.56]  Um,
[4032.80 --> 4034.54]  while using XAI tech
[4034.54 --> 4035.96]  to improve ad targeting.
[4036.46 --> 4037.26]  It's like,
[4038.20 --> 4039.06]  dude,
[4039.10 --> 4039.80]  are you not gonna,
[4040.14 --> 4040.58]  you're not gonna,
[4040.80 --> 4041.52]  are you not gonna buy
[4041.52 --> 4042.38]  me dinner first?
[4043.04 --> 4043.48]  Like,
[4043.94 --> 4045.06]  just boom,
[4045.06 --> 4045.42]  boom,
[4045.54 --> 4047.14]  straight to more procreation,
[4047.22 --> 4048.06]  not enough children.
[4049.84 --> 4050.90]  Bend right over
[4050.90 --> 4051.94]  because this is how
[4051.94 --> 4053.06]  I intend to use
[4053.06 --> 4054.92]  my giant GPU farm
[4054.92 --> 4056.26]  powered by
[4056.26 --> 4057.64]  natural gas turbines
[4057.64 --> 4058.32]  that I didn't get
[4058.32 --> 4059.34]  a permit for.
[4059.60 --> 4061.20]  Wait,
[4061.26 --> 4061.52]  really?
[4062.14 --> 4062.88]  I'm just gonna,
[4063.04 --> 4064.40]  I'm just gonna straight up,
[4064.74 --> 4065.86]  I'm gonna straight up,
[4065.98 --> 4066.16]  yep,
[4066.28 --> 4067.38]  I'm gonna have people pay
[4067.38 --> 4068.98]  to be the best answer.
[4069.20 --> 4069.58]  I mean,
[4069.84 --> 4070.98]  it worked great for Google
[4070.98 --> 4072.44]  with their top sponsored
[4072.44 --> 4073.10]  search results,
[4073.16 --> 4073.30]  right?
[4073.36 --> 4073.58]  Let's,
[4073.72 --> 4074.58]  let's just do that.
[4074.64 --> 4075.02]  But AI,
[4075.50 --> 4076.58]  are you serious right now?
[4076.58 --> 4077.34]  You don't even have
[4077.34 --> 4079.42]  the top AI chat bot
[4079.42 --> 4080.82]  and you're already
[4080.82 --> 4082.36]  trying to be the first one
[4082.36 --> 4083.34]  to completely in-ify.
[4083.50 --> 4083.66]  I mean,
[4083.70 --> 4085.06]  we obviously knew.
[4085.70 --> 4085.86]  Like,
[4086.50 --> 4087.72]  Amazon was up front
[4087.72 --> 4088.88]  about the only reason
[4088.88 --> 4089.92]  Alexa existing
[4089.92 --> 4091.80]  being so that she could
[4091.80 --> 4092.68]  get to know you
[4092.68 --> 4093.90]  and understand what
[4093.90 --> 4094.68]  you want to buy
[4094.68 --> 4096.04]  so you could buy it
[4096.04 --> 4096.64]  off Amazon
[4096.64 --> 4097.80]  using Alexa.
[4098.26 --> 4098.48]  Like,
[4098.52 --> 4099.34]  that was the only reason
[4099.34 --> 4100.28]  Alexa ever existed
[4100.28 --> 4101.04]  in the first place.
[4101.42 --> 4101.54]  Like,
[4101.58 --> 4102.66]  Amazon was pretty
[4102.66 --> 4104.24]  straightforward about that
[4104.24 --> 4106.38]  and it didn't take off
[4106.38 --> 4107.74]  because people
[4107.74 --> 4108.60]  immediately
[4108.60 --> 4109.68]  would use
[4109.68 --> 4111.04]  whatever didn't
[4111.04 --> 4111.68]  shove product
[4111.68 --> 4112.20]  down their throat
[4112.20 --> 4112.84]  because they're not
[4112.84 --> 4113.70]  actually really
[4113.70 --> 4114.80]  very interested in that.
[4115.52 --> 4116.48]  The only reason
[4116.48 --> 4117.42]  anybody cares
[4117.42 --> 4118.52]  about ChatGPT
[4118.52 --> 4119.18]  is because
[4119.18 --> 4121.08]  they think
[4121.08 --> 4122.34]  it's giving them
[4122.34 --> 4123.66]  like the right answers
[4123.66 --> 4124.30]  even though it's
[4124.30 --> 4124.92]  trained on
[4124.92 --> 4126.32]  a poisoned web
[4126.32 --> 4127.48]  that is just full of
[4127.48 --> 4129.08]  completely corrupted
[4129.08 --> 4130.12]  clickbait articles
[4130.12 --> 4130.64]  and all that.
[4130.74 --> 4131.64]  So it's definitely
[4131.64 --> 4132.58]  got its own problems.
[4132.78 --> 4133.86]  But it isn't just
[4133.86 --> 4135.90]  brazenly recommending
[4135.90 --> 4136.80]  whoever paid me
[4136.80 --> 4137.36]  the most.
[4137.96 --> 4138.12]  I mean,
[4138.16 --> 4139.06]  if you wanted to do that,
[4139.50 --> 4140.20]  you could just watch
[4140.20 --> 4140.84]  tech YouTubers.
[4140.84 --> 4142.58]  New ideas
[4142.58 --> 4143.66]  on how to poison AI
[4143.66 --> 4144.14]  as well.
[4144.24 --> 4144.88]  That's how you can tell
[4144.88 --> 4145.84]  he's not listening to me.
[4146.52 --> 4147.52]  There's ones to,
[4148.04 --> 4149.24]  there's ones where
[4149.24 --> 4150.08]  you can trap.
[4150.14 --> 4150.64]  Self-own.
[4150.78 --> 4151.58]  You can trap it.
[4152.50 --> 4153.48]  How is it a self-own?
[4153.94 --> 4154.14]  What?
[4154.22 --> 4154.48]  Me.
[4155.40 --> 4155.70]  Oh.
[4155.88 --> 4157.00]  I self-owned myself.
[4157.88 --> 4158.30]  Got it.
[4158.42 --> 4158.62]  All right.
[4159.30 --> 4159.62]  Fair enough.
[4159.98 --> 4160.56]  I am,
[4160.56 --> 4161.86]  I imply that I am
[4161.86 --> 4162.72]  bought and paid for.
[4163.74 --> 4164.40]  I like,
[4164.48 --> 4165.26]  I like playing
[4165.26 --> 4166.82]  into the conspiracy theories
[4166.82 --> 4169.54]  as if they can afford me.
[4170.84 --> 4172.18]  Nvidia can.
[4172.80 --> 4173.18]  I mean,
[4173.22 --> 4173.54]  they can,
[4173.60 --> 4174.12]  but they won't.
[4174.88 --> 4175.52]  Cheap f***s.
[4175.52 --> 4187.18]  I do think
[4187.18 --> 4187.68]  it's interesting
[4187.68 --> 4188.18]  because like,
[4188.42 --> 4190.66]  you have a video
[4190.66 --> 4192.34]  coming on
[4192.34 --> 4193.74]  vibe coding.
[4193.94 --> 4194.22]  Yeah.
[4194.22 --> 4197.12]  and like,
[4197.22 --> 4198.40]  I defended the,
[4198.94 --> 4199.06]  okay,
[4199.16 --> 4200.10]  you didn't use
[4200.10 --> 4201.96]  a coding specific
[4201.96 --> 4204.02]  tool
[4204.02 --> 4205.04]  because
[4205.04 --> 4207.02]  I do think
[4207.02 --> 4207.70]  the vast majority
[4207.70 --> 4208.06]  of people,
[4208.22 --> 4208.54]  including,
[4208.78 --> 4209.68]  you know,
[4209.92 --> 4210.80]  people that I know
[4210.80 --> 4211.28]  and I know
[4211.28 --> 4211.98]  this has happened,
[4212.54 --> 4213.30]  just dive right
[4213.30 --> 4214.28]  into using ChatTPD.
[4214.34 --> 4214.76]  They don't even know
[4214.76 --> 4215.58]  what the other ones are.
[4216.40 --> 4217.52]  So I think it is
[4217.52 --> 4218.30]  very realistic
[4218.30 --> 4219.32]  for a new
[4219.32 --> 4220.08]  to these type
[4220.08 --> 4220.88]  of systems people,
[4221.64 --> 4222.24]  person,
[4222.40 --> 4222.56]  sorry,
[4222.56 --> 4224.38]  to use just ChatTPD
[4224.38 --> 4225.16]  instead of something else.
[4225.22 --> 4226.14]  It's the most well-known thing.
[4227.22 --> 4228.18]  But do you think
[4228.18 --> 4229.14]  releasing that video
[4229.14 --> 4230.32]  after 5 is out
[4230.32 --> 4231.66]  and not having used 5
[4231.66 --> 4232.92]  is
[4232.92 --> 4236.00]  good?
[4236.32 --> 4236.54]  Yeah,
[4236.56 --> 4237.06]  I think it's fine
[4237.06 --> 4238.32]  because we can acknowledge that.
[4238.84 --> 4239.56]  I haven't shot
[4239.56 --> 4240.86]  any of the A-roll of it.
[4241.38 --> 4242.12]  I've only shot
[4242.12 --> 4242.98]  the coding challenge
[4242.98 --> 4244.86]  and we still haven't had
[4244.86 --> 4245.66]  the real developer
[4245.66 --> 4246.58]  to my knowledge
[4246.58 --> 4248.96]  try to beat me.
[4249.40 --> 4249.68]  So like,
[4249.72 --> 4250.48]  we still have,
[4250.74 --> 4251.34]  like it's going to be,
[4251.34 --> 4251.88]  I think it's going to be
[4251.88 --> 4252.84]  very clear to people
[4252.84 --> 4254.10]  from the way we set up
[4254.10 --> 4254.60]  the video
[4254.60 --> 4256.38]  and present it
[4256.38 --> 4257.52]  that this is a challenge
[4257.52 --> 4258.02]  that took place
[4258.02 --> 4258.66]  a while ago
[4258.66 --> 4259.98]  and it was
[4259.98 --> 4260.76]  with the tools
[4260.76 --> 4261.20]  that exist.
[4261.32 --> 4262.06]  And literally
[4262.06 --> 4263.12]  in my screen cap,
[4263.24 --> 4264.20]  I drop down,
[4264.30 --> 4264.80]  you can see
[4264.80 --> 4265.90]  what models are available
[4265.90 --> 4266.44]  to me
[4266.44 --> 4268.24]  in the OpenAI interface
[4268.24 --> 4268.60]  and stuff.
[4268.66 --> 4269.16]  So it's not like
[4269.16 --> 4269.76]  people are going to be like,
[4269.80 --> 4270.82]  why didn't you click
[4270.82 --> 4271.48]  on that one?
[4271.90 --> 4273.02]  Like I clicked on the one
[4273.02 --> 4273.66]  that was supposedly
[4273.66 --> 4274.52]  better for programming.
[4274.70 --> 4275.02]  So like,
[4275.08 --> 4275.26]  whatever,
[4275.38 --> 4275.66]  I don't know.
[4276.30 --> 4277.16]  Like I did what
[4277.16 --> 4278.54]  I think a normal user
[4278.54 --> 4279.08]  would do.
[4279.08 --> 4281.26]  And we have all that
[4281.26 --> 4282.50]  documented.
[4283.50 --> 4283.62]  Yep.
[4283.78 --> 4284.58]  It's all documented.
[4284.90 --> 4286.02]  So I'm really not
[4286.02 --> 4286.78]  that worried about it.
[4287.18 --> 4288.20]  And the point
[4288.20 --> 4289.38]  is not necessarily
[4289.38 --> 4291.50]  like the moment in time.
[4291.50 --> 4292.48]  The point is asking
[4292.48 --> 4293.58]  like a bigger question.
[4293.80 --> 4294.78]  And I think that
[4294.78 --> 4295.88]  regardless of what model
[4295.88 --> 4296.30]  we use,
[4296.34 --> 4297.24]  we are going to run
[4297.24 --> 4298.92]  into bigger answers.
[4299.50 --> 4299.90]  Like,
[4300.64 --> 4301.30]  okay,
[4301.58 --> 4302.44]  now what about
[4302.44 --> 4302.96]  the maintenance
[4302.96 --> 4303.74]  of that code?
[4304.80 --> 4305.54]  Like that's
[4305.54 --> 4306.54]  a huge question
[4306.54 --> 4307.76]  because I have
[4307.76 --> 4308.30]  a working,
[4308.60 --> 4309.44]  you know,
[4309.62 --> 4310.06]  JavaScript,
[4310.84 --> 4312.06]  but I still
[4312.06 --> 4313.00]  don't know
[4313.00 --> 4313.60]  JavaScript.
[4314.18 --> 4315.40]  I haven't actually
[4315.40 --> 4316.16]  solved the problem,
[4316.26 --> 4316.84]  which is that I don't
[4316.84 --> 4317.56]  know how to code
[4317.56 --> 4319.00]  or script
[4319.00 --> 4319.56]  or anything.
[4319.70 --> 4320.36]  like modern,
[4320.54 --> 4321.26]  modern tools
[4321.26 --> 4322.22]  will tell you
[4322.22 --> 4323.26]  where the error is
[4323.26 --> 4323.90]  and generally
[4323.90 --> 4324.76]  some information
[4324.76 --> 4325.36]  about the error
[4325.36 --> 4325.84]  and then you can
[4325.84 --> 4326.80]  feed that error
[4326.80 --> 4327.56]  and that information.
[4328.22 --> 4328.78]  You might have done
[4328.78 --> 4329.48]  this in your challenge.
[4329.68 --> 4330.60]  Back to the LLM,
[4330.68 --> 4331.38]  the LLM can try
[4331.38 --> 4332.22]  to fix things for you
[4332.22 --> 4332.56]  and whatnot,
[4332.70 --> 4332.94]  but it,
[4333.00 --> 4333.68]  it does,
[4333.78 --> 4334.60]  it does definitely
[4334.60 --> 4335.58]  become a problem.
[4336.02 --> 4336.24]  Yeah.
[4336.24 --> 4336.38]  Yeah.
[4339.20 --> 4340.08]  We are supposed
[4340.08 --> 4341.36]  to explain
[4341.36 --> 4342.30]  merch messages.
[4345.14 --> 4346.18]  We should do that.
[4347.68 --> 4348.48]  So if you want
[4348.48 --> 4349.46]  to chat with the show,
[4349.68 --> 4350.88]  a great way to do it
[4350.88 --> 4351.50]  is to send
[4351.50 --> 4352.64]  a merch message.
[4352.76 --> 4353.30]  Merch messages
[4353.30 --> 4354.18]  are easy.
[4354.50 --> 4355.30]  All you got to do
[4355.30 --> 4356.14]  is head over
[4356.14 --> 4358.32]  to LTTstore.com,
[4358.66 --> 4359.46]  add one of our
[4359.46 --> 4360.48]  delightful products
[4360.48 --> 4361.10]  to your cart
[4361.10 --> 4361.34]  like,
[4361.46 --> 4362.12]  ooh,
[4363.06 --> 4364.10]  when life gives you
[4364.10 --> 4364.56]  e-waste,
[4364.68 --> 4365.66]  make a CPU
[4365.66 --> 4366.40]  fidget spinner.
[4366.76 --> 4367.38]  Shop now.
[4367.46 --> 4367.78]  That's right,
[4367.82 --> 4368.20]  my friends,
[4368.48 --> 4369.36]  you can buy
[4369.36 --> 4370.26]  the fidget spinner
[4370.26 --> 4370.86]  that I have been
[4370.86 --> 4371.42]  playing with
[4371.42 --> 4371.98]  throughout the show,
[4372.06 --> 4372.60]  showing you guys
[4372.60 --> 4374.36]  just how long
[4374.36 --> 4375.70]  it spins for.
[4375.90 --> 4376.54]  Right now,
[4376.62 --> 4377.98]  on LTTstore.com,
[4378.30 --> 4378.90]  these spinners
[4378.90 --> 4379.50]  are made out of
[4379.50 --> 4381.58]  genuine AM2,
[4381.80 --> 4382.52]  AM3,
[4382.52 --> 4383.80]  and potentially
[4383.80 --> 4383.82]  and potentially
[4383.82 --> 4386.36]  even AM4 CPUs.
[4387.80 --> 4388.28]  Okay.
[4388.50 --> 4388.72]  Anyway,
[4388.82 --> 4389.22]  they're made out
[4389.22 --> 4391.24]  of AMD CPUs
[4391.24 --> 4392.62]  that were tossed.
[4392.76 --> 4393.66]  Millions of CPUs
[4393.66 --> 4394.56]  get tossed every year
[4394.56 --> 4395.46]  and we thought,
[4395.62 --> 4395.78]  hey,
[4395.94 --> 4396.88]  why not rescue
[4396.88 --> 4397.76]  a few of them
[4397.76 --> 4398.38]  and turn them
[4398.38 --> 4399.64]  into a fun,
[4400.12 --> 4401.30]  a fun,
[4401.54 --> 4402.80]  satisfying
[4402.80 --> 4403.94]  desk toy.
[4404.10 --> 4404.82]  We put some
[4404.82 --> 4405.44]  really,
[4405.66 --> 4406.26]  really nice
[4406.26 --> 4407.02]  spinny bearings
[4407.02 --> 4407.32]  in these.
[4407.38 --> 4407.78]  You can see
[4407.78 --> 4408.50]  they really do
[4408.50 --> 4409.52]  go for an awfully
[4409.52 --> 4410.14]  long time.
[4410.14 --> 4411.48]  It is worth noting
[4411.48 --> 4413.18]  that the balance
[4413.18 --> 4414.64]  will not be perfect.
[4415.46 --> 4416.00]  I just want to make
[4416.00 --> 4416.74]  that really clear
[4416.74 --> 4418.22]  because while we do
[4418.22 --> 4419.02]  put our hole
[4419.02 --> 4419.88]  down the center
[4419.88 --> 4420.56]  of the CPU,
[4421.28 --> 4422.28]  depending on the
[4422.28 --> 4423.18]  size of the die
[4423.18 --> 4424.00]  and the position
[4424.00 --> 4424.66]  of the die
[4424.66 --> 4426.26]  or any IO chips
[4426.26 --> 4427.24]  or whatever is
[4427.24 --> 4428.28]  under that IHS,
[4428.90 --> 4429.26]  even,
[4429.60 --> 4430.64]  even the pins
[4430.64 --> 4431.24]  on the back
[4431.24 --> 4432.18]  not being completely
[4432.18 --> 4432.68]  symmetrical
[4432.68 --> 4433.96]  can throw the balance
[4433.96 --> 4434.58]  off a little bit.
[4434.88 --> 4435.86]  If we made
[4435.86 --> 4436.86]  a perfectly balanced
[4436.86 --> 4437.94]  symmetrical CPU spinner,
[4438.12 --> 4438.46]  you'd know
[4438.46 --> 4439.04]  because it would be
[4439.04 --> 4439.68]  perfectly balanced
[4439.68 --> 4440.18]  and symmetrical.
[4440.62 --> 4441.54]  But this is made
[4441.54 --> 4442.64]  out of E-Way CPUs,
[4442.72 --> 4443.58]  so there will be
[4443.58 --> 4444.16]  a little bit
[4444.16 --> 4445.06]  of a wobble to it,
[4445.38 --> 4446.52]  but you can take
[4446.52 --> 4447.54]  any satisfaction
[4447.54 --> 4448.70]  you lose from the wobble
[4448.70 --> 4449.60]  you can gain
[4449.60 --> 4450.12]  from knowing
[4450.12 --> 4450.90]  that you kept
[4450.90 --> 4451.46]  this CPU
[4451.46 --> 4452.26]  out of the landfill
[4452.26 --> 4452.92]  and turned it
[4452.92 --> 4453.74]  into a fun,
[4453.90 --> 4454.74]  satisfying little toy.
[4455.14 --> 4455.56]  By the way...
[4455.56 --> 4456.08]  Yeah, and to be honest,
[4456.20 --> 4457.04]  with the thickness
[4457.04 --> 4458.72]  of your finger,
[4459.04 --> 4460.40]  so Sebastian says
[4460.40 --> 4461.20]  that we tested them
[4461.20 --> 4461.60]  and the balance
[4461.60 --> 4462.30]  on them was terrible.
[4462.70 --> 4464.06]  I will also say,
[4464.20 --> 4464.38]  however,
[4464.68 --> 4465.48]  that Sebastian...
[4465.48 --> 4466.18]  Oh, he was talking
[4466.18 --> 4466.62]  about Intel.
[4466.76 --> 4467.14]  He was talking
[4467.14 --> 4467.60]  about Intel.
[4467.78 --> 4468.52]  They were much worse.
[4468.52 --> 4469.36]  Oh, I see.
[4469.46 --> 4469.68]  Okay.
[4470.36 --> 4471.32]  Yep, because they're...
[4471.32 --> 4472.16]  Sebastian Tyni gave me
[4472.16 --> 4472.90]  one to play with
[4472.90 --> 4473.92]  at OpenSauce
[4473.92 --> 4475.98]  and while the balance
[4475.98 --> 4476.72]  isn't perfect,
[4476.90 --> 4478.08]  the thickness of your finger
[4478.08 --> 4480.64]  is a decently large surface
[4480.64 --> 4481.90]  and I was able
[4481.90 --> 4482.88]  to very consistently
[4482.88 --> 4483.58]  get it spinning
[4483.58 --> 4484.38]  on one finger,
[4484.66 --> 4485.56]  like without pinch.
[4486.44 --> 4487.12]  Yeah, there he goes.
[4487.30 --> 4487.54]  Yeah, yeah,
[4487.54 --> 4488.10]  it's not that bad.
[4488.48 --> 4489.34]  The Intel bones
[4489.34 --> 4490.00]  were really bad
[4490.00 --> 4491.12]  because of the position
[4491.12 --> 4491.60]  of the die
[4491.60 --> 4492.86]  and the notches
[4492.86 --> 4494.52]  in the substrate
[4494.52 --> 4496.02]  and just a variety
[4496.02 --> 4496.26]  of reasons.
[4496.26 --> 4496.72]  The balance isn't
[4496.72 --> 4497.52]  like that bad.
[4497.60 --> 4497.72]  No.
[4497.80 --> 4498.52]  Like you can tell
[4498.52 --> 4499.82]  it's not the easiest thing
[4499.82 --> 4500.42]  to get spinning
[4500.42 --> 4501.02]  on one finger
[4501.02 --> 4502.06]  compared to something
[4502.06 --> 4503.12]  that is perfectly balanced
[4503.12 --> 4505.26]  but like it's fine.
[4505.34 --> 4505.86]  It's spinning
[4505.86 --> 4507.06]  which helps it.
[4507.54 --> 4508.38]  Your finger's also
[4508.38 --> 4509.00]  not a pinpoint.
[4509.76 --> 4510.14]  And that's what
[4510.14 --> 4511.04]  makes it real, man.
[4511.62 --> 4512.44]  That's what makes it real.
[4512.50 --> 4513.28]  It's a real CPU.
[4514.16 --> 4515.26]  We also made it
[4515.26 --> 4516.78]  super easy to disassemble
[4516.78 --> 4517.60]  if you want,
[4517.72 --> 4518.26]  if your bearing
[4518.26 --> 4519.50]  gets mucked up
[4519.50 --> 4520.24]  or if you just want
[4520.24 --> 4521.24]  to put in your own bearing.
[4521.58 --> 4522.30]  All you got to do
[4522.30 --> 4522.90]  is,
[4523.38 --> 4524.24]  here, hold on.
[4524.38 --> 4524.92]  I guess we go
[4524.92 --> 4525.48]  Linus cam.
[4525.64 --> 4526.26]  Was I supposed
[4526.26 --> 4527.14]  to show this, Dan?
[4528.14 --> 4529.38]  I have no idea.
[4529.54 --> 4529.98]  I think so.
[4530.02 --> 4530.46]  I think Artie
[4530.46 --> 4531.24]  wanted me to show it.
[4531.54 --> 4532.72]  So you just unscrew
[4532.72 --> 4534.32]  the thumb
[4534.32 --> 4535.22]  maboober
[4535.22 --> 4535.86]  here.
[4536.72 --> 4537.02]  Okay.
[4537.56 --> 4537.96]  Okay.
[4538.12 --> 4538.80]  A little something
[4538.80 --> 4539.34]  like that.
[4541.38 --> 4542.00]  Oh, God.
[4543.32 --> 4543.70]  Oh, yeah.
[4543.72 --> 4544.58]  We wanted to do a thing
[4544.58 --> 4545.38]  but couldn't this week.
[4545.92 --> 4546.16]  Yeah.
[4546.38 --> 4546.68]  Okay.
[4547.08 --> 4547.60]  So you take
[4547.60 --> 4548.56]  that off
[4548.56 --> 4549.38]  and then
[4549.38 --> 4550.80]  there's two screws
[4550.80 --> 4551.24]  on top
[4551.24 --> 4551.92]  and then there's
[4551.92 --> 4552.84]  oh, okay.
[4552.98 --> 4553.36]  Do you have your
[4553.36 --> 4553.98]  precision kit?
[4554.00 --> 4554.78]  Yeah, I have a precision kit.
[4554.84 --> 4555.12]  Cool.
[4555.52 --> 4556.52]  I have, I has.
[4557.10 --> 4558.14]  Anyway, the point is
[4558.14 --> 4558.80]  merch messages.
[4558.98 --> 4559.44]  So if you want to
[4559.44 --> 4560.10]  send a merch message
[4560.10 --> 4560.74]  you just gotta
[4560.74 --> 4562.90]  throw something
[4562.90 --> 4563.38]  in your cart
[4563.38 --> 4564.42]  on lttstore.com
[4564.42 --> 4565.12]  and when we're live
[4565.12 --> 4566.10]  you'll see a box
[4566.10 --> 4566.50]  that'll let you
[4566.50 --> 4567.14]  leave a merch message
[4567.14 --> 4567.66]  and it'll go to
[4567.66 --> 4568.34]  producer Dan.
[4568.44 --> 4568.88]  Oh, Lordy.
[4569.36 --> 4569.86]  There you go.
[4571.10 --> 4571.78]  Who will
[4571.78 --> 4573.24]  put it on the bottom
[4573.24 --> 4574.82]  maybe with
[4574.82 --> 4575.74]  a relevant response
[4575.74 --> 4576.22]  maybe with
[4576.22 --> 4577.28]  an irrelevant response.
[4577.40 --> 4577.94]  We have no way
[4577.94 --> 4578.28]  of knowing.
[4578.38 --> 4578.96]  He's a mad lad.
[4580.12 --> 4581.12]  Or he'll
[4581.12 --> 4582.08]  forward it to someone
[4582.08 --> 4582.60]  who can answer
[4582.60 --> 4583.00]  your question
[4583.00 --> 4584.32]  or he will curate it
[4584.32 --> 4585.78]  for me, Luke
[4585.78 --> 4586.68]  and Dan
[4586.68 --> 4587.96]  to respond to
[4587.96 --> 4589.42]  and he'll show you
[4589.42 --> 4590.72]  what that curation
[4590.72 --> 4591.22]  looks like.
[4591.28 --> 4591.70]  Okay, hold on.
[4591.78 --> 4592.14]  First though,
[4592.18 --> 4592.86]  let's finish this.
[4593.40 --> 4593.74]  Okay.
[4593.90 --> 4594.94]  So there you can see
[4594.94 --> 4595.32]  the
[4595.32 --> 4598.24]  precision manufactured
[4598.24 --> 4599.74]  aluminum frame
[4599.74 --> 4600.32]  Mabuber
[4600.32 --> 4601.12]  that we have
[4601.12 --> 4602.60]  and then there
[4602.60 --> 4604.72]  there's our bearing.
[4605.50 --> 4606.34]  Look at me.
[4606.46 --> 4607.56]  I'm bearing eye.
[4607.56 --> 4609.62]  Wow.
[4611.90 --> 4612.96]  I did say earlier
[4612.96 --> 4613.56]  I'm not gay
[4613.56 --> 4614.10]  so now I'm
[4614.10 --> 4614.74]  the bearing straight.
[4614.74 --> 4614.86]  Are you bearing ten?
[4616.12 --> 4616.60]  Oh.
[4619.22 --> 4620.72]  Anyway, you can also see
[4620.72 --> 4622.76]  you can also see
[4622.76 --> 4624.22]  how we
[4624.22 --> 4625.56]  made the CPU
[4625.56 --> 4626.64]  work as a fidget spinner.
[4627.02 --> 4628.18]  It no longer works
[4628.18 --> 4628.74]  as a CPU
[4628.74 --> 4629.72]  once we're done with it.
[4629.72 --> 4633.24]  So that's
[4633.24 --> 4634.06]  that's something
[4634.06 --> 4634.68]  that happens.
[4637.46 --> 4637.90]  Um,
[4638.12 --> 4638.72]  anywho,
[4639.18 --> 4639.70]  Dan,
[4639.78 --> 4640.72]  where did we leave off again?
[4640.92 --> 4641.90]  I was going to read you
[4641.90 --> 4642.36]  a merch message.
[4642.36 --> 4643.08]  You were going to read me
[4643.08 --> 4643.54]  a merch message.
[4643.62 --> 4644.48]  Right, right, right, right, right.
[4644.52 --> 4645.84]  To show how the curation works.
[4647.14 --> 4647.76]  That's right.
[4647.90 --> 4648.26]  Uh,
[4648.44 --> 4648.98]  uh, yes.
[4649.04 --> 4649.68]  Let's do that
[4649.68 --> 4650.58]  while I reassemble
[4650.58 --> 4651.64]  um,
[4652.04 --> 4653.26]  this fidget spinner.
[4653.72 --> 4654.04]  Okay.
[4654.24 --> 4655.38]  The dancing
[4655.38 --> 4656.26]  that's right there
[4656.26 --> 4656.72]  really,
[4656.84 --> 4657.04]  really,
[4657.04 --> 4657.96]  really sounded like
[4657.96 --> 4658.50]  a,
[4658.50 --> 4658.80]  a,
[4658.80 --> 4659.10]  like,
[4659.56 --> 4660.24]  parrot helping
[4660.24 --> 4660.96]  a small child
[4660.96 --> 4661.60]  through something.
[4662.56 --> 4663.60]  I'm not a child.
[4663.92 --> 4664.66]  Don't lose this
[4664.66 --> 4665.02]  cruise,
[4665.16 --> 4665.60]  Linus.
[4665.82 --> 4666.98]  I'm not going to.
[4667.86 --> 4668.64]  And you're not even
[4668.64 --> 4669.64]  my real dad.
[4670.34 --> 4671.32]  He's just cranky,
[4671.40 --> 4671.66]  hasn't he?
[4671.66 --> 4672.26]  He's juice.
[4672.76 --> 4673.64]  He's so cute.
[4674.18 --> 4674.84]  He's so good.
[4675.08 --> 4676.38]  He does usually need a little
[4676.38 --> 4677.38]  snacky before the show.
[4677.76 --> 4677.78]  Do you want,
[4677.78 --> 4678.90]  do you want some tackies?
[4678.90 --> 4679.78]  Last thing you need
[4679.78 --> 4681.04]  is me on a juice sugar high.
[4683.10 --> 4683.54]  Uh,
[4683.66 --> 4684.18]  that'd be fun.
[4684.60 --> 4684.76]  Uh,
[4684.82 --> 4686.20]  you spin me right round
[4686.20 --> 4687.00]  dot DLL.
[4687.52 --> 4687.86]  Linus,
[4687.94 --> 4689.08]  why did you go with
[4689.08 --> 4689.98]  orange for LTT
[4689.98 --> 4691.04]  and would you ever
[4691.04 --> 4692.18]  switch it to blue?
[4692.52 --> 4693.68]  Excited to see y'all
[4693.68 --> 4694.30]  at Whaleland.
[4694.80 --> 4695.50]  The very,
[4695.70 --> 4696.58]  very legitimate
[4696.58 --> 4698.04]  real actual reason
[4698.04 --> 4699.00]  is that,
[4699.00 --> 4699.90]  um,
[4699.92 --> 4700.72]  my screwdriver
[4700.72 --> 4702.42]  that was gifted to me
[4702.42 --> 4703.52]  when I was in high school,
[4703.98 --> 4705.02]  my snap-on,
[4705.38 --> 4705.98]  um,
[4706.08 --> 4706.94]  ratcheting screwdriver
[4706.94 --> 4708.56]  that sort of opened
[4708.56 --> 4709.90]  my eyes to the delights
[4709.90 --> 4711.56]  of quality tools,
[4711.56 --> 4712.24]  uh,
[4712.24 --> 4712.76]  was orange.
[4713.82 --> 4715.50]  And that,
[4715.68 --> 4716.82]  that using that
[4716.82 --> 4717.94]  orange screwdriver
[4717.94 --> 4719.88]  that became kind of iconic
[4719.88 --> 4721.32]  in the early days
[4721.32 --> 4722.84]  of NCIX tech tips
[4722.84 --> 4724.12]  was something that
[4724.12 --> 4725.04]  kind of tickled
[4725.04 --> 4725.86]  the cameraman.
[4726.26 --> 4726.46]  Uh,
[4727.16 --> 4727.32]  well,
[4727.40 --> 4727.56]  well,
[4727.56 --> 4728.48]  he put it in the logo
[4728.48 --> 4729.32]  because he thought
[4729.32 --> 4729.78]  it was funny
[4729.78 --> 4730.40]  that I had like
[4730.40 --> 4731.20]  a hundred Canadian
[4731.20 --> 4732.04]  dollar screwdriver,
[4732.34 --> 4733.06]  which to him
[4733.06 --> 4733.72]  was ridiculous.
[4734.34 --> 4735.46]  And I mean,
[4735.46 --> 4736.32]  I guess still is,
[4736.42 --> 4736.62]  but,
[4736.74 --> 4737.04]  uh,
[4737.36 --> 4737.62]  hey,
[4737.86 --> 4738.44]  half a,
[4738.44 --> 4739.90]  half a million of you
[4739.90 --> 4740.48]  can't be,
[4740.56 --> 4741.40]  can't be that wrong
[4741.40 --> 4741.76]  with me,
[4741.76 --> 4741.96]  right?
[4742.46 --> 4742.98]  Um,
[4743.58 --> 4746.22]  and so he integrated
[4746.22 --> 4746.70]  that,
[4746.74 --> 4747.52]  that orange
[4747.52 --> 4748.96]  into the branding
[4748.96 --> 4750.16]  of NCIX tech tips
[4750.16 --> 4750.66]  with the,
[4750.66 --> 4751.24]  the picture of the
[4751.24 --> 4751.66]  screwdriver,
[4751.80 --> 4752.44]  since it's such an
[4752.44 --> 4753.14]  important tool
[4753.14 --> 4753.46]  for,
[4753.56 --> 4754.52]  for working on PCs.
[4754.52 --> 4756.46]  and the rest is
[4756.46 --> 4757.80]  kind of history.
[4758.14 --> 4758.30]  Uh,
[4758.36 --> 4759.02]  fun fact,
[4759.10 --> 4759.64]  by the way,
[4759.96 --> 4762.24]  it's not actually
[4762.24 --> 4763.70]  orange.
[4764.70 --> 4765.18]  Um,
[4765.22 --> 4766.46]  the LTT color
[4766.46 --> 4768.08]  looks orange
[4768.08 --> 4769.64]  against most of the
[4769.64 --> 4770.64]  backdrops where it
[4770.64 --> 4771.10]  appears.
[4771.88 --> 4772.40]  Uh,
[4772.40 --> 4773.32]  but it's like actually
[4773.32 --> 4774.92]  kind of red
[4774.92 --> 4775.56]  or rather,
[4775.76 --> 4776.02]  no,
[4776.10 --> 4776.28]  wait,
[4776.34 --> 4776.42]  no,
[4776.46 --> 4777.12]  it is orange,
[4777.20 --> 4778.02]  but then we had to
[4778.02 --> 4779.12]  make it red to look
[4779.12 --> 4780.42]  orange in the banner
[4780.42 --> 4780.92]  on the forum.
[4781.02 --> 4781.36]  Is that right,
[4781.42 --> 4781.58]  Luke?
[4781.70 --> 4782.32]  I'm trying to remember.
[4782.44 --> 4783.08]  It is orange.
[4783.24 --> 4784.00]  And the WAN show,
[4784.00 --> 4784.90]  the WAN show is
[4784.90 --> 4785.82]  definitely not orange.
[4785.92 --> 4786.48]  That one's red.
[4786.50 --> 4787.06]  WAN show is red.
[4787.16 --> 4787.32]  Yeah.
[4787.98 --> 4788.32]  Um,
[4788.32 --> 4789.62]  the original LTT orange,
[4789.80 --> 4790.56]  like the screwdriver
[4790.56 --> 4791.48]  that you had is
[4791.48 --> 4792.18]  actually orange.
[4792.18 --> 4792.40]  Oh no,
[4792.44 --> 4792.92]  that's orange.
[4793.64 --> 4794.04]  Yeah.
[4794.20 --> 4795.18]  The problem is when you
[4795.18 --> 4796.26]  place that color of
[4796.26 --> 4797.24]  orange against other
[4797.24 --> 4797.54]  things,
[4797.64 --> 4798.96]  it starts to like shift
[4798.96 --> 4799.58]  really oddly.
[4800.06 --> 4801.22]  So a lot of the
[4801.22 --> 4802.74]  places where you see
[4802.74 --> 4803.66]  LTT orange,
[4803.84 --> 4805.12]  it's not actually
[4805.12 --> 4806.02]  LTT orange.
[4806.20 --> 4807.58]  It's an orange that
[4807.58 --> 4807.96]  is,
[4807.96 --> 4808.96]  uh,
[4810.02 --> 4811.18]  hewed so that it
[4811.18 --> 4812.10]  looks correct.
[4812.46 --> 4812.94]  Um,
[4813.12 --> 4813.62]  instead of
[4813.62 --> 4814.44]  being actually
[4814.44 --> 4814.82]  correct,
[4815.02 --> 4816.38]  which is weird.
[4816.80 --> 4817.18]  Um,
[4817.24 --> 4817.74]  I don't know if
[4817.74 --> 4818.56]  that's still a thing
[4818.56 --> 4819.06]  on the forum,
[4819.18 --> 4820.16]  but like very early
[4820.16 --> 4820.80]  forum days,
[4820.80 --> 4821.36]  that was a problem
[4821.36 --> 4821.86]  we ran into
[4821.86 --> 4822.54]  because everyone
[4822.54 --> 4823.04]  was saying that
[4823.04 --> 4823.72]  it was incorrect
[4823.72 --> 4824.62]  when it actually
[4824.62 --> 4825.44]  was correct.
[4825.62 --> 4826.14]  It just,
[4826.54 --> 4827.22]  with the other colors
[4827.22 --> 4827.64]  that were there,
[4827.68 --> 4828.58]  it looked really wrong.
[4828.64 --> 4829.62]  So then we made it
[4829.62 --> 4830.34]  incorrect and everyone
[4830.34 --> 4830.60]  was like,
[4830.68 --> 4831.12]  oh good,
[4831.16 --> 4831.80]  you fixed it.
[4831.80 --> 4832.32]  And it's like,
[4832.40 --> 4832.64]  well,
[4833.00 --> 4834.36]  colors are a hell
[4834.36 --> 4834.80]  of a drug.
[4835.04 --> 4835.22]  Sort of.
[4835.22 --> 4835.68]  By the way,
[4835.74 --> 4835.88]  Dan,
[4836.16 --> 4836.80]  you're not allowed
[4836.80 --> 4837.64]  to tell the viewers
[4837.64 --> 4838.78]  to calm their tits.
[4839.00 --> 4840.90]  I said thine.
[4842.46 --> 4843.52]  What is happening
[4843.52 --> 4843.90]  today?
[4844.46 --> 4845.18]  Settle thine
[4845.18 --> 4845.94]  jimmies.
[4846.04 --> 4846.68]  Dan's fighting
[4846.68 --> 4847.26]  with Bryce
[4847.26 --> 4848.00]  in the floatplane
[4848.00 --> 4848.38]  chat.
[4848.54 --> 4849.32]  Bryce is a good
[4849.32 --> 4849.92]  person.
[4849.92 --> 4850.32]  Uh,
[4850.32 --> 4854.12]  Bryce was asking
[4854.12 --> 4855.66]  when the floatplane
[4855.66 --> 4857.04]  exclusive with extras
[4857.04 --> 4858.10]  for Scrapyard Wars
[4858.10 --> 4858.52]  10,
[4858.90 --> 4859.36]  uh,
[4859.58 --> 4860.32]  part one
[4860.32 --> 4861.42]  is coming out.
[4861.50 --> 4862.52]  It will come out
[4862.52 --> 4864.12]  during this show.
[4864.28 --> 4865.10]  I will be launching
[4865.10 --> 4866.44]  episode one
[4866.44 --> 4867.84]  as well as the extras
[4867.84 --> 4868.62]  or sorry,
[4868.72 --> 4869.26]  part one
[4869.26 --> 4870.30]  as well as the extras
[4870.30 --> 4870.92]  for part one.
[4871.00 --> 4871.64]  It's going to be great.
[4871.68 --> 4872.36]  It's coming soon.
[4872.44 --> 4873.22]  It's coming very soon.
[4873.82 --> 4874.22]  Um,
[4874.48 --> 4875.48]  what else am I supposed
[4875.48 --> 4876.40]  to be doing right now,
[4876.46 --> 4876.66]  Dan?
[4877.40 --> 4877.72]  Uh,
[4877.80 --> 4878.74]  doing that announcement.
[4879.08 --> 4879.68]  Oh yes,
[4879.78 --> 4880.06]  right.
[4880.80 --> 4881.40]  Which one?
[4881.48 --> 4882.44]  That one or the other one?
[4882.66 --> 4882.92]  No.
[4883.14 --> 4883.84]  I'm supposed to be doing
[4883.84 --> 4884.86]  the CW announcements.
[4885.34 --> 4885.56]  Yeah,
[4885.70 --> 4886.72]  which you just did.
[4886.92 --> 4887.16]  Okay,
[4887.18 --> 4887.94]  well I did one of them.
[4888.54 --> 4889.86]  I haven't done the other one.
[4890.32 --> 4891.24]  So get a grip,
[4891.36 --> 4891.54]  Luke.
[4894.12 --> 4895.54]  On this screwdriver.
[4901.24 --> 4902.36]  I'm excited about this.
[4902.98 --> 4903.86]  I need this.
[4903.96 --> 4904.58]  Do you see this?
[4904.66 --> 4905.18]  Do you see this?
[4905.58 --> 4906.40]  We've got-
[4906.40 --> 4907.08]  I, in particular,
[4907.24 --> 4907.60]  need this.
[4907.66 --> 4908.36]  We've got grip.
[4909.56 --> 4910.04]  Specifically,
[4910.66 --> 4911.96]  screwdriver grip tape.
[4912.50 --> 4913.36]  It's designed
[4913.36 --> 4915.20]  to give your favorite tool
[4915.20 --> 4916.88]  a significant amount
[4916.88 --> 4917.76]  of extra grip
[4917.76 --> 4918.56]  when you're working
[4918.56 --> 4919.06]  under the hood
[4919.06 --> 4919.66]  of your car
[4919.66 --> 4920.40]  or working
[4920.40 --> 4921.04]  on your screwdriver
[4921.04 --> 4921.88]  with gloves
[4921.88 --> 4923.44]  and we might have
[4923.44 --> 4924.36]  called up our friends
[4924.36 --> 4925.04]  at dbrand
[4925.04 --> 4926.54]  for a little help
[4926.54 --> 4928.58]  from some old friends.
[4928.76 --> 4929.54]  Dun-dun-dun-dun.
[4929.76 --> 4930.52]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[4930.52 --> 4930.72]  Sorry.
[4931.12 --> 4931.56]  Um,
[4931.88 --> 4932.90]  yeah,
[4933.04 --> 4933.38]  we didn't,
[4933.44 --> 4934.06]  we didn't want to talk
[4934.06 --> 4934.52]  to them about,
[4934.78 --> 4935.08]  well,
[4935.14 --> 4935.68]  we didn't want to talk
[4935.68 --> 4936.06]  to them at all,
[4936.10 --> 4936.28]  really.
[4936.64 --> 4937.04]  Um,
[4937.04 --> 4937.76]  but unfortunately,
[4937.76 --> 4939.18]  they are annoyingly good
[4939.18 --> 4939.96]  at this sort of thing
[4939.96 --> 4940.76]  and it's available
[4940.76 --> 4941.08]  and it's available now
[4941.08 --> 4942.32]  at lmg.gg
[4942.32 --> 4944.22]  slash grip tape.
[4944.78 --> 4945.20]  So,
[4945.40 --> 4945.52]  here,
[4945.62 --> 4946.44]  we'll bring that up.
[4947.24 --> 4948.10]  Screwdriver grip tape.
[4948.18 --> 4948.54]  That's right,
[4948.60 --> 4949.06]  10 bucks
[4949.06 --> 4950.56]  and you get
[4950.56 --> 4952.02]  this.
[4952.12 --> 4953.14]  You get an extra one
[4953.14 --> 4954.32]  as well as the three
[4954.32 --> 4955.38]  that you actually need
[4955.38 --> 4957.36]  and we're using it
[4957.36 --> 4958.16]  completely wrong
[4958.16 --> 4958.72]  in the picture,
[4958.92 --> 4960.18]  but don't worry about that
[4960.18 --> 4961.00]  because the point
[4961.00 --> 4962.74]  is so that you can see it.
[4962.74 --> 4965.36]  Oh,
[4965.42 --> 4965.52]  yeah,
[4965.58 --> 4966.34]  these are for stubbies,
[4966.40 --> 4967.52]  by the way,
[4967.60 --> 4968.08]  just so you know.
[4968.56 --> 4968.96]  Oh.
[4969.08 --> 4969.18]  Yeah,
[4969.38 --> 4969.90]  we have,
[4969.98 --> 4970.76]  so we have grip tape
[4970.76 --> 4973.20]  dutes for full-size drivers
[4973.20 --> 4974.14]  as well for stubbies.
[4974.32 --> 4976.76]  It works shockingly well.
[4977.26 --> 4977.54]  Uh,
[4977.54 --> 4978.18]  sweaty palms
[4978.18 --> 4978.96]  and slippery hands,
[4979.08 --> 4979.72]  no more.
[4980.00 --> 4981.06]  This precision cut grip tape
[4981.06 --> 4981.70]  is designed to add
[4981.70 --> 4982.46]  just the right amount of grip
[4982.46 --> 4983.36]  to your favorite screwdriver.
[4983.50 --> 4984.04]  Brought to you in partnership
[4984.04 --> 4984.60]  with dbrand.
[4985.18 --> 4985.50]  Uh,
[4985.50 --> 4986.30]  no more slipping,
[4986.44 --> 4987.16]  whether you're ring gloves
[4987.16 --> 4987.46]  or,
[4987.64 --> 4987.76]  you know,
[4987.78 --> 4988.04]  whatever.
[4988.20 --> 4989.04]  The grip tape helps you
[4989.04 --> 4989.78]  maintain control
[4989.78 --> 4991.52]  over your driver.
[4991.66 --> 4992.34]  Each pack includes
[4992.34 --> 4992.92]  a set of grip tape
[4992.92 --> 4994.28]  for both sizes of screwdriver,
[4994.46 --> 4995.04]  one for the standard
[4995.04 --> 4995.62]  LTT screwdriver
[4995.62 --> 4998.50]  and one for the stubby screwdriver.
[4998.70 --> 4999.76]  It's a great little add-on
[4999.76 --> 5000.92]  if you're looking for,
[5001.06 --> 5001.24]  uh,
[5001.28 --> 5001.52]  you know,
[5001.60 --> 5004.34]  a gift for the LTT screwdriver
[5004.34 --> 5005.66]  enjoyer in your life,
[5005.74 --> 5006.40]  then,
[5006.72 --> 5006.98]  uh,
[5006.98 --> 5007.98]  especially if they use,
[5008.06 --> 5009.06]  if they use gloves
[5009.06 --> 5009.86]  or if they're like
[5009.86 --> 5011.04]  a super sweaty type person,
[5011.08 --> 5012.54]  it is very grippy.
[5012.72 --> 5013.16]  So,
[5013.28 --> 5014.76]  if you are never
[5014.76 --> 5015.94]  going to be sweaty
[5015.94 --> 5016.36]  and,
[5016.52 --> 5016.64]  you know,
[5016.66 --> 5017.68]  you don't really need
[5017.68 --> 5018.66]  to torque anything down,
[5018.84 --> 5020.40]  I would say it's not necessary,
[5020.58 --> 5022.14]  but if you've ever found yourself
[5022.14 --> 5022.68]  slipping,
[5023.28 --> 5024.40]  this will do it.
[5026.40 --> 5026.84]  Uh,
[5026.84 --> 5027.80]  when is the bit storage case
[5027.80 --> 5028.24]  coming out?
[5028.50 --> 5028.70]  Uh,
[5029.36 --> 5029.70]  soon,
[5029.82 --> 5030.14]  I think?
[5030.48 --> 5031.64]  People saw a,
[5031.72 --> 5031.80]  uh,
[5031.80 --> 5032.12]  not sure.
[5033.84 --> 5034.84]  People saw something.
[5035.10 --> 5035.66]  I'll say that.
[5036.60 --> 5037.44]  They saw something?
[5038.68 --> 5039.16]  Yeah.
[5039.60 --> 5039.90]  What?
[5040.60 --> 5041.54]  There was a,
[5041.72 --> 5044.10]  there was a part of a video
[5044.10 --> 5045.50]  where something was on a desk.
[5045.50 --> 5047.58]  Oh,
[5047.64 --> 5048.08]  by the way,
[5048.20 --> 5048.58]  just,
[5048.68 --> 5049.34]  let's take a moment
[5049.34 --> 5050.86]  to enjoy the team's
[5050.86 --> 5051.74]  great photography.
[5051.90 --> 5052.48]  Here's Sherrod
[5052.48 --> 5055.02]  with his new pride and joy here
[5055.02 --> 5056.28]  with his screwdriver.
[5056.44 --> 5057.76]  I love how every shot
[5057.76 --> 5058.72]  we have of the screwdriver
[5058.72 --> 5059.70]  has us not touching
[5059.70 --> 5060.20]  the grip tape.
[5060.28 --> 5060.78]  I get it.
[5061.02 --> 5062.22]  I understand why
[5062.22 --> 5063.14]  we did it this way.
[5063.40 --> 5064.36]  When he's working on the bike,
[5064.40 --> 5065.04]  is he touching it?
[5065.72 --> 5066.16]  Let's see.
[5066.24 --> 5066.78]  Here's Plouf.
[5066.94 --> 5067.72]  Here's Plouf with,
[5067.80 --> 5069.58]  here's Plouf with his purple car.
[5070.58 --> 5071.30]  Once again,
[5071.48 --> 5072.38]  not touching the grip tape.
[5072.46 --> 5072.96]  Dang it, people.
[5073.18 --> 5073.78]  I understand.
[5074.18 --> 5075.86]  I understand why we did it that way.
[5076.00 --> 5076.98]  It just triggers me.
[5077.20 --> 5077.82]  You should definitely
[5077.82 --> 5078.56]  be touching the grip.
[5081.32 --> 5082.32]  Willing Spy asks,
[5082.44 --> 5083.58]  how strong is the adhesive?
[5084.12 --> 5085.32]  The answer is yes.
[5088.24 --> 5088.80]  I'll be,
[5088.88 --> 5089.74]  I'll be real with you guys.
[5089.74 --> 5090.72]  There's also an extra one in there.
[5092.26 --> 5093.50]  I'll be real with you guys.
[5093.66 --> 5094.30]  This is,
[5094.40 --> 5094.70]  I think,
[5094.76 --> 5095.76]  the first product
[5095.76 --> 5097.02]  that I've ever been
[5097.02 --> 5097.78]  the one to source
[5097.78 --> 5099.50]  because
[5099.50 --> 5100.52]  I was looking
[5100.52 --> 5101.16]  for something
[5101.16 --> 5103.24]  that would actually
[5103.24 --> 5104.90]  not come off
[5104.90 --> 5106.36]  the edges of the steps
[5106.36 --> 5108.52]  on my backyard
[5108.52 --> 5110.30]  like pavers.
[5111.32 --> 5112.38]  So I needed,
[5112.44 --> 5113.36]  I needed grippy,
[5113.60 --> 5114.04]  grippy
[5114.04 --> 5115.50]  strips
[5115.50 --> 5116.24]  at the ends
[5116.24 --> 5117.80]  and I bought like
[5117.80 --> 5119.02]  crappy ones on Amazon.
[5119.14 --> 5119.62]  I bought like
[5119.62 --> 5120.46]  a bunch of stuff
[5120.46 --> 5121.78]  and it all sucked
[5121.78 --> 5122.76]  and finally
[5122.76 --> 5123.90]  I found something
[5123.90 --> 5124.80]  that like
[5124.80 --> 5126.70]  would not
[5126.70 --> 5127.88]  fucking come off
[5127.88 --> 5129.92]  and then we turned
[5129.92 --> 5130.70]  it into this product.
[5131.50 --> 5132.46]  So we sourced
[5132.46 --> 5133.28]  the same stuff
[5133.28 --> 5133.96]  that I used
[5133.96 --> 5134.96]  on my stairs
[5134.96 --> 5136.86]  and now it's
[5136.86 --> 5137.54]  for our screwdriver.
[5137.90 --> 5138.16]  That makes sense.
[5138.60 --> 5138.80]  Yeah,
[5138.86 --> 5139.76]  so this is the first time
[5139.76 --> 5140.52]  I have ever like
[5140.52 --> 5141.74]  directly been in charge
[5141.74 --> 5142.50]  of the sourcing
[5142.50 --> 5143.72]  and then we worked
[5143.72 --> 5144.28]  with Vbrand
[5144.28 --> 5144.86]  to get them
[5144.86 --> 5145.66]  cut up into stickers
[5145.66 --> 5146.64]  because we don't like
[5146.64 --> 5148.46]  have a process for that.
[5148.56 --> 5149.82]  We're not a sticker manufacturer.
[5150.04 --> 5150.68]  What the f***
[5150.68 --> 5151.02]  do we know
[5151.02 --> 5151.70]  about any of that?
[5152.38 --> 5152.90]  So that's
[5152.90 --> 5154.12]  You sell stickers.
[5155.16 --> 5155.48]  Okay,
[5155.64 --> 5156.20]  that's true
[5156.20 --> 5157.02]  but different.
[5157.72 --> 5158.52]  And I don't really,
[5158.96 --> 5160.06]  we don't really sell them.
[5160.20 --> 5161.08]  They're more like
[5161.08 --> 5162.42]  free with your order
[5162.42 --> 5163.16]  and the bonus bin.
[5163.22 --> 5164.10]  People do buy them though.
[5164.48 --> 5165.12]  There's a new pack.
[5165.22 --> 5165.82]  People do buy them.
[5166.54 --> 5168.40]  Is the new bonus bin pack up?
[5168.60 --> 5169.30]  I think people
[5169.30 --> 5170.36]  have been mentioning it.
[5170.80 --> 5171.84]  They're very excited.
[5173.12 --> 5173.88]  Hold on.
[5174.36 --> 5175.12]  Hold on.
[5175.68 --> 5176.46]  I might be lying.
[5176.58 --> 5177.22]  Where do I find them?
[5178.34 --> 5179.34]  I might be lying.
[5180.04 --> 5181.10]  Maybe I was lied to.
[5181.10 --> 5181.48]  You would.
[5182.10 --> 5183.26]  Is set three the latest?
[5183.36 --> 5183.48]  Yeah,
[5183.50 --> 5184.16]  I think this is it.
[5185.66 --> 5186.48]  Holy s***.
[5187.44 --> 5187.80]  Oh,
[5188.28 --> 5189.56]  sticker packs are back,
[5189.68 --> 5190.08]  boys.
[5190.76 --> 5191.62]  And this is an
[5191.62 --> 5193.66]  absolutely fire pack.
[5196.42 --> 5196.86]  Oh,
[5196.92 --> 5197.68]  there are some
[5197.68 --> 5199.58]  golden ones in here.
[5199.78 --> 5200.98]  Got the tax right off.
[5201.10 --> 5201.78]  Gone fishing.
[5203.06 --> 5203.84]  Tech yacht.
[5204.26 --> 5204.52]  Oh,
[5204.52 --> 5205.50]  I love the tech yacht.
[5206.36 --> 5207.30]  The flow point game boy
[5207.30 --> 5207.78]  is sick.
[5208.20 --> 5208.66]  Yeah,
[5208.78 --> 5209.10]  buddy.
[5210.00 --> 5210.48]  Yeah,
[5210.62 --> 5210.98]  buddy.
[5212.10 --> 5213.02]  I'm trying to remember
[5213.02 --> 5213.88]  if that one has any
[5213.88 --> 5214.82]  like foil on it.
[5214.92 --> 5215.50]  I don't think so.
[5215.58 --> 5215.88]  Actually.
[5216.58 --> 5216.98]  Wait,
[5217.38 --> 5217.76]  does it,
[5217.80 --> 5218.50]  does it have some shine?
[5218.62 --> 5218.76]  Oh,
[5218.78 --> 5219.36]  I can't remember.
[5219.72 --> 5220.64]  I can't remember.
[5221.08 --> 5221.90]  I can't remember.
[5221.94 --> 5222.50]  And I can't tell,
[5222.66 --> 5223.22]  but yeah,
[5223.22 --> 5224.48]  this is an absolutely
[5224.48 --> 5226.16]  bomb sticker pack.
[5226.72 --> 5227.58]  Freaking love it.
[5227.78 --> 5228.10]  Wait,
[5228.20 --> 5229.12]  is the transparent
[5229.12 --> 5229.90]  screwdriver in it?
[5230.70 --> 5230.92]  Yes,
[5230.94 --> 5231.18]  it is.
[5231.22 --> 5231.34]  Yeah.
[5231.40 --> 5231.56]  Yeah.
[5231.56 --> 5231.70]  Yeah.
[5231.70 --> 5232.16]  There it is.
[5232.64 --> 5233.08]  Sick.
[5233.48 --> 5233.74]  Yeah.
[5233.74 --> 5234.22]  Absolutely.
[5234.22 --> 5235.06]  Great job.
[5235.06 --> 5237.48]  Oh,
[5237.58 --> 5237.82]  hey,
[5238.16 --> 5239.38]  speaking of tech yacht,
[5239.80 --> 5241.38]  I have a major update
[5241.38 --> 5242.24]  on tech plane.
[5243.78 --> 5245.44]  The price of this
[5245.44 --> 5247.36]  compelling aircraft
[5247.36 --> 5248.58]  has been reduced.
[5249.36 --> 5249.98]  USD
[5249.98 --> 5252.34]  3.5 million.
[5252.34 --> 5253.62]  I got to say,
[5253.70 --> 5254.10]  you guys,
[5254.24 --> 5255.36]  this is looking like
[5255.36 --> 5256.48]  a pretty strong
[5256.48 --> 5257.54]  candidate here.
[5258.78 --> 5260.36]  User MR underscore
[5260.36 --> 5262.00]  Jesse over on the
[5262.00 --> 5263.00]  subreddit picked up
[5263.00 --> 5263.56]  on this.
[5264.08 --> 5264.52]  Dude,
[5264.74 --> 5265.66]  check this out.
[5266.38 --> 5267.24]  Three and a half
[5267.24 --> 5267.50]  million.
[5267.60 --> 5268.54]  This is an Airbus
[5268.54 --> 5269.54]  A320.
[5269.74 --> 5270.56]  I think it is.
[5271.22 --> 5271.72]  What are we looking
[5271.72 --> 5272.14]  at here?
[5272.86 --> 5273.60]  Look at this.
[5275.02 --> 5275.92]  Main bedroom.
[5277.34 --> 5278.18]  Got what appears
[5278.18 --> 5278.96]  to be like
[5278.96 --> 5279.70]  some private
[5279.70 --> 5280.94]  meeting rooms here.
[5281.66 --> 5282.76]  Got like a
[5282.76 --> 5284.04]  got a lounge area
[5284.04 --> 5285.08]  here where you can
[5285.08 --> 5286.12]  have what appears
[5286.12 --> 5286.92]  to be like
[5286.92 --> 5287.96]  15,
[5288.28 --> 5289.42]  20 some odd
[5289.42 --> 5289.96]  people.
[5292.72 --> 5293.54]  Got some,
[5293.62 --> 5294.04]  I don't know,
[5294.16 --> 5294.88]  fine looking,
[5295.44 --> 5296.62]  fine looking cockpit
[5296.62 --> 5298.96]  up in the front
[5298.96 --> 5299.96]  where you have
[5299.96 --> 5300.48]  all the
[5300.48 --> 5302.24]  knobs and dials.
[5302.42 --> 5302.78]  Earlier,
[5303.00 --> 5303.54]  where like you're
[5303.54 --> 5304.08]  not going to remember
[5304.08 --> 5304.56]  if it's going to
[5304.56 --> 5305.10]  have an eight pack
[5305.10 --> 5305.44]  or not.
[5306.04 --> 5306.48]  No,
[5306.60 --> 5306.72]  no,
[5306.82 --> 5307.94]  I think I can
[5307.94 --> 5308.94]  recognize a sexy
[5308.94 --> 5309.30]  plane.
[5309.44 --> 5309.70]  I think,
[5309.76 --> 5310.42]  I think I can,
[5310.54 --> 5311.52]  I think I can
[5311.52 --> 5312.84]  appreciate the fine
[5312.84 --> 5314.76]  curves of a plane
[5314.76 --> 5316.62]  shaped airplane.
[5319.02 --> 5319.46]  So,
[5319.82 --> 5320.34]  are you into
[5320.34 --> 5321.46]  the three jets
[5321.46 --> 5322.26]  or the two jets?
[5322.50 --> 5322.64]  Which,
[5322.78 --> 5325.20]  which plane type
[5325.20 --> 5325.84]  are you into?
[5326.56 --> 5327.32]  One behind,
[5327.48 --> 5328.36]  one on each side,
[5329.06 --> 5330.00]  two on each side.
[5330.58 --> 5330.72]  Yeah,
[5330.72 --> 5330.82]  yeah,
[5330.82 --> 5331.04]  yeah.
[5331.04 --> 5331.42]  Two,
[5331.54 --> 5332.08]  three or four.
[5332.20 --> 5332.70]  This is a good
[5332.70 --> 5333.14]  question.
[5333.58 --> 5334.30]  I got to say,
[5334.38 --> 5335.06]  I got to say
[5335.06 --> 5336.62]  the runway presence,
[5336.62 --> 5337.98]  the runway presence
[5337.98 --> 5338.58]  of a,
[5338.58 --> 5339.26]  of a Falcon,
[5340.02 --> 5340.72]  the trijet.
[5340.94 --> 5341.72]  I don't mind it.
[5341.80 --> 5342.26]  I don't mind it.
[5342.26 --> 5342.80]  So the three?
[5343.10 --> 5343.60]  I don't,
[5343.60 --> 5344.38]  I don't mind it.
[5344.60 --> 5345.28]  A three-way,
[5345.50 --> 5347.10]  three-way jet
[5347.10 --> 5348.26]  and then one behind.
[5348.62 --> 5348.78]  Yeah.
[5349.12 --> 5349.28]  Yeah.
[5349.28 --> 5349.34]  Yeah.
[5349.34 --> 5349.56]  Yeah.
[5349.84 --> 5350.16]  Two,
[5350.48 --> 5351.20]  two on the sides
[5351.20 --> 5352.00]  and like one kind
[5352.00 --> 5352.66]  of in the middle.
[5352.76 --> 5353.36]  I also don't mind
[5353.36 --> 5354.16]  being the one in the
[5354.16 --> 5354.32]  middle,
[5354.40 --> 5354.78]  if you know what
[5354.78 --> 5355.14]  I'm saying.
[5355.78 --> 5356.00]  Oh,
[5356.06 --> 5356.28]  okay.
[5356.62 --> 5356.78]  Yeah,
[5356.78 --> 5356.92]  yeah,
[5356.92 --> 5356.96]  yeah.
[5356.96 --> 5357.16]  You know,
[5357.16 --> 5357.84]  riding middle.
[5360.24 --> 5361.28]  Who needs an aisle
[5361.28 --> 5361.84]  in the middle
[5361.84 --> 5362.54]  with the rows
[5362.54 --> 5363.06]  of the seats
[5363.06 --> 5363.76]  when you can have
[5363.76 --> 5364.18]  the middle?
[5364.68 --> 5365.42]  You know what I'm saying?
[5365.42 --> 5366.18]  Know what I'm saying?
[5366.34 --> 5366.50]  Yeah,
[5366.50 --> 5366.74]  yeah.
[5366.98 --> 5367.38]  Yeah,
[5367.38 --> 5367.60]  yeah.
[5368.74 --> 5369.70]  Booger fingers
[5369.70 --> 5371.04]  as Linus announcing
[5371.04 --> 5371.98]  he's gay again.
[5380.76 --> 5381.36]  Anywho,
[5381.70 --> 5385.16]  so for those of you
[5385.16 --> 5385.80]  on the,
[5385.80 --> 5386.60]  on the subreddit
[5386.60 --> 5388.20]  wondering if this is real,
[5388.38 --> 5389.04]  I,
[5389.12 --> 5390.12]  I was genuinely
[5390.12 --> 5391.60]  pretty curious about this.
[5391.64 --> 5392.16]  I was like,
[5392.20 --> 5392.52]  okay,
[5392.52 --> 5393.54]  what could possibly
[5393.54 --> 5395.28]  be wrong with this thing?
[5395.42 --> 5395.98]  To make it
[5395.98 --> 5396.70]  three and a half
[5396.70 --> 5397.44]  million dollars.
[5397.82 --> 5399.10]  I think what happened
[5399.10 --> 5400.30]  is they missed a zero.
[5400.84 --> 5402.14]  I found a listing
[5402.14 --> 5404.38]  for another plane
[5404.38 --> 5405.62]  that had
[5405.62 --> 5409.00]  4,405.5 hours
[5409.00 --> 5409.66]  since new
[5409.66 --> 5412.16]  and 2930 landings.
[5412.28 --> 5412.74]  So here,
[5412.80 --> 5413.92]  let's just key that in.
[5414.20 --> 5416.36]  4,405.5 hours
[5416.36 --> 5417.24]  since new
[5417.24 --> 5418.64]  jet for sale.
[5419.88 --> 5420.66]  Because that,
[5420.72 --> 5421.48]  that seems,
[5421.70 --> 5422.46]  you know,
[5422.46 --> 5423.32]  r slash
[5423.32 --> 5424.46]  oddly specific.
[5425.42 --> 5426.50]  And it appears
[5426.50 --> 5427.18]  to be
[5427.18 --> 5428.46]  this one.
[5428.60 --> 5429.12]  It's a,
[5429.12 --> 5429.84]  it's a Hawker
[5429.84 --> 5430.56]  4000,
[5430.88 --> 5431.84]  which is
[5431.84 --> 5432.72]  not
[5432.72 --> 5433.86]  that
[5433.86 --> 5434.72]  Airbus.
[5435.98 --> 5436.70]  Looks like,
[5436.78 --> 5437.16]  oh man,
[5437.24 --> 5437.38]  where,
[5437.54 --> 5438.48]  where is it?
[5439.08 --> 5440.06]  This is stupid.
[5440.24 --> 5440.38]  What,
[5440.54 --> 5440.74]  AI,
[5440.88 --> 5442.04]  why are you so stupid?
[5442.52 --> 5442.84]  Like,
[5442.88 --> 5443.60]  why do I have to,
[5444.02 --> 5445.28]  why do I have to do this?
[5445.82 --> 5447.14]  Why do I have to put in the site?
[5447.38 --> 5447.60]  See,
[5447.74 --> 5448.40]  here's the one.
[5449.56 --> 5449.84]  There,
[5449.84 --> 5451.16]  three and a half mil
[5451.16 --> 5452.32]  and,
[5452.40 --> 5453.06]  uh,
[5453.78 --> 5455.86]  4,405 hours
[5455.86 --> 5456.56]  since new
[5456.56 --> 5458.28]  2930 landings.
[5458.52 --> 5459.30]  So there,
[5460.04 --> 5461.16]  so it looks like
[5461.16 --> 5462.44]  this Facebook post
[5462.44 --> 5463.62]  just had completely
[5463.62 --> 5464.38]  the wrong plane.
[5464.66 --> 5465.46]  I gotta say though,
[5465.54 --> 5466.18]  once again,
[5466.28 --> 5466.54]  Luke,
[5467.18 --> 5467.50]  like,
[5467.56 --> 5468.46]  are you seeing this?
[5468.54 --> 5469.16]  I am
[5469.16 --> 5471.56]  surprised.
[5471.56 --> 5474.62]  Cause whenever I looked up,
[5474.70 --> 5474.84]  like,
[5474.92 --> 5475.62]  how much does
[5475.62 --> 5477.10]  a private jet cost?
[5477.60 --> 5477.74]  Here,
[5477.88 --> 5478.30]  check this out.
[5478.30 --> 5479.50]  Your screen is pretty small for me.
[5479.54 --> 5480.26]  Whenever I looked up,
[5480.36 --> 5480.56]  like,
[5480.74 --> 5482.50]  how much does a private jet cost?
[5482.68 --> 5482.98]  You know,
[5483.24 --> 5484.40]  I'd get answers like
[5484.40 --> 5485.58]  25 million,
[5485.80 --> 5487.12]  50 million dollars
[5487.12 --> 5487.42]  or,
[5487.58 --> 5487.78]  you know,
[5487.86 --> 5488.20]  whatever.
[5489.16 --> 5489.44]  Yeah,
[5489.58 --> 5490.16]  but I mean,
[5490.22 --> 5491.08]  that's probably new,
[5491.16 --> 5491.32]  right?
[5491.38 --> 5491.52]  Like,
[5491.58 --> 5492.82]  this isn't a new plane.
[5492.86 --> 5493.08]  No,
[5493.18 --> 5493.62]  this is a,
[5493.62 --> 5494.72]  this is a 2008.
[5495.44 --> 5496.28]  But still.
[5497.30 --> 5498.56]  But I bet you this was up there
[5498.56 --> 5499.24]  when it was new.
[5499.48 --> 5499.68]  Oh,
[5499.88 --> 5500.34]  I'm,
[5500.50 --> 5501.54]  I'm sure it was.
[5501.80 --> 5502.76]  But is it really,
[5502.90 --> 5504.66]  am I incredibly lame
[5504.66 --> 5506.22]  because I was actually more interested
[5506.22 --> 5507.46]  in what laptop that was?
[5508.20 --> 5508.78]  The laptop.
[5509.16 --> 5509.36]  Oh,
[5510.66 --> 5510.98]  dude,
[5511.18 --> 5511.68]  that lap,
[5511.78 --> 5512.44]  this picture
[5512.44 --> 5513.50]  was taken
[5513.50 --> 5515.16]  when PCMCIA
[5515.16 --> 5515.78]  was a thing,
[5515.86 --> 5516.06]  buddy.
[5517.08 --> 5517.48]  Yeah.
[5517.66 --> 5518.22]  Look at that.
[5518.22 --> 5519.06]  Not even that one.
[5519.62 --> 5519.80]  Oh,
[5519.84 --> 5520.80]  that one is interesting.
[5520.82 --> 5521.30]  You don't like that one?
[5521.30 --> 5522.18]  I was talking about the other laptop.
[5522.18 --> 5522.56]  You don't like that?
[5522.60 --> 5522.84]  Hold on.
[5522.84 --> 5523.84]  What are these magazines?
[5523.96 --> 5524.96]  Is that Ohio Magazine?
[5526.10 --> 5526.44]  No,
[5526.58 --> 5528.06]  I don't know what this is.
[5529.02 --> 5529.42]  Flying.
[5530.42 --> 5530.60]  Do you,
[5530.60 --> 5531.64]  have,
[5531.84 --> 5532.86]  have you seen the latest
[5532.86 --> 5533.74]  flying?
[5534.22 --> 5534.62]  Flying.
[5535.86 --> 5537.62]  How staged is that out of 10?
[5537.70 --> 5537.90]  Okay,
[5537.94 --> 5538.12]  sorry,
[5538.18 --> 5539.04]  what laptop are we talking about?
[5539.72 --> 5540.80]  Go to a previous photo?
[5540.86 --> 5541.02]  This guy,
[5541.08 --> 5541.52]  this is the same one.
[5541.60 --> 5541.90]  You'll see it.
[5543.74 --> 5543.92]  What,
[5544.00 --> 5544.14]  sorry,
[5544.22 --> 5545.06]  I have a big delay.
[5545.06 --> 5545.38]  Oh,
[5545.46 --> 5546.36]  it's the same laptop.
[5546.50 --> 5546.68]  Dude,
[5546.94 --> 5548.40]  Intel Centrino,
[5548.56 --> 5548.88]  baby.
[5549.46 --> 5550.88]  Get that Centrino.
[5552.00 --> 5552.64]  Let's go.
[5552.64 --> 5552.88]  Let's go.
[5552.88 --> 5553.56]  How,
[5553.56 --> 5556.64]  how long has it been since whatever,
[5556.84 --> 5560.24]  because I guarantee you this picture was actually taken relatively recently,
[5560.24 --> 5564.32]  because the interior of this plane has been redone since 2008.
[5564.54 --> 5565.14]  So,
[5565.44 --> 5566.00]  this is a,
[5566.00 --> 5566.90]  this is a new photo.
[5567.16 --> 5576.62]  I just guarantee you that whoever does the staging for these photos just didn't bother to replace this laptop for 20 years.
[5577.54 --> 5577.90]  Yeah.
[5578.02 --> 5578.34]  Also,
[5578.52 --> 5581.22]  this is clearly Photoshopped.
[5581.22 --> 5581.58]  The three,
[5581.72 --> 5582.22]  like how,
[5582.22 --> 5583.60]  three audio jacks in the front.
[5583.68 --> 5584.74]  How rough is that?
[5584.76 --> 5585.24]  Heck yeah.
[5585.82 --> 5586.00]  Dude,
[5586.06 --> 5586.20]  I'm,
[5586.20 --> 5587.44]  I'm liking the audio jacks.
[5587.44 --> 5587.98]  You could,
[5588.04 --> 5589.62]  you could rebind those in software.
[5590.04 --> 5591.58]  Get that good 5.1.
[5592.46 --> 5592.76]  Yeah.
[5593.16 --> 5593.52]  Yep.
[5593.68 --> 5594.32]  Windows XP,
[5594.48 --> 5594.80]  baby.
[5597.38 --> 5598.30]  Sick laptop.
[5600.00 --> 5600.52]  Anyway,
[5600.70 --> 5601.00]  I can,
[5601.06 --> 5601.74]  I continue,
[5602.00 --> 5605.28]  I continue to be surprised at like,
[5605.38 --> 5605.48]  I,
[5605.52 --> 5605.80]  cause I,
[5605.80 --> 5608.26]  I guess the cost is actually in the other stuff.
[5609.26 --> 5610.48]  Physical left and right buttons.
[5610.64 --> 5610.90]  Sorry.
[5611.00 --> 5611.24]  I'm just,
[5611.28 --> 5612.18]  I'm still on the laptop.
[5612.32 --> 5613.26]  You're still on the laptop.
[5613.64 --> 5615.92]  I miss physical left and like the,
[5616.12 --> 5616.58]  oh man,
[5616.70 --> 5618.00]  like my laptop right now is,
[5618.08 --> 5619.74]  is one big touchpad.
[5619.92 --> 5621.22]  You just have to like find it.
[5621.28 --> 5622.06]  It doesn't feel right.
[5624.14 --> 5626.22]  Bent Bob says 2008 plane.
[5626.22 --> 5627.06]  Is it cheap?
[5627.32 --> 5631.70]  Because commonly needed parts are now rare and everyone who has them has a,
[5631.92 --> 5633.64]  I know what I got mentality.
[5633.64 --> 5634.50]  Um,
[5634.56 --> 5636.06]  and I got to tell you,
[5636.10 --> 5637.06]  so Luke,
[5637.10 --> 5641.58]  you remember me kind of dropping the bombshell that,
[5641.68 --> 5641.90]  that,
[5642.02 --> 5644.16]  that original like gamer plane,
[5644.16 --> 5645.02]  um,
[5645.04 --> 5646.58]  was under a million dollars,
[5646.58 --> 5646.88]  right?
[5647.52 --> 5648.28]  For like an,
[5648.34 --> 5650.72]  an actual whole ass jet,
[5651.26 --> 5651.92]  like a,
[5651.92 --> 5656.58]  a jet plane that could like fly across North America,
[5656.58 --> 5659.10]  which blew my freaking mind.
[5659.54 --> 5660.10]  And,
[5660.10 --> 5660.52]  uh,
[5660.58 --> 5660.76]  sorry,
[5660.86 --> 5661.28]  what was it?
[5661.36 --> 5662.90]  Bob or something like that.
[5663.54 --> 5663.80]  Yeah.
[5663.96 --> 5665.84]  Bent Bob nailed it.
[5666.66 --> 5668.68]  Absolutely nailed it.
[5668.68 --> 5681.42]  A huge part of why an older craft like that would be so cheap is because the cost of maintaining it is so much higher than the cost of,
[5681.42 --> 5683.50]  of acquiring it that,
[5683.50 --> 5684.00]  um,
[5684.00 --> 5684.88]  it's kind of like,
[5684.88 --> 5685.22]  uh,
[5685.22 --> 5689.50]  it's kind of like over leveraging a house that goes down in value.
[5689.50 --> 5690.92]  So you're effectively underwater.
[5691.36 --> 5694.50]  Like there reaches a point where they're worth more as,
[5694.62 --> 5704.72]  as the spare parts for the other people who are desperately trying to keep their older planes in the air than they're worth to try to bring them back up to speed and keep them flying.
[5704.72 --> 5705.16]  Um,
[5705.88 --> 5706.30]  so it's,
[5706.40 --> 5707.24]  it's a whole thing.
[5707.34 --> 5708.88]  And I got to tell you,
[5708.90 --> 5712.84]  as someone who only recently like learned about any of this,
[5712.94 --> 5718.26]  I was blown away by how few of these planes they actually make.
[5719.40 --> 5721.80]  So that one was an Astra.
[5722.92 --> 5723.36]  Oh,
[5723.46 --> 5724.24]  what was it called?
[5724.70 --> 5727.06]  Astra 100 or something like that.
[5729.20 --> 5729.76]  Oh,
[5729.84 --> 5730.18]  I can't,
[5730.24 --> 5731.22]  I can't remember anymore.
[5731.50 --> 5731.98]  Anyway,
[5732.20 --> 5733.16]  Gulfstream bought them.
[5734.02 --> 5734.54]  Sorry.
[5734.72 --> 5734.94]  Sorry.
[5735.02 --> 5735.14]  Yeah,
[5735.14 --> 5735.34]  no,
[5735.40 --> 5736.94]  it was an Astra SPX.
[5737.54 --> 5739.56]  I-A-I Astra SPX.
[5739.60 --> 5741.86]  So that was before Gulfstream acquired them.
[5742.18 --> 5742.50]  Uh,
[5742.50 --> 5743.36]  how many produced?
[5743.48 --> 5743.84]  Let's see.
[5744.12 --> 5745.62]  Let's see if the AI gets this right.
[5746.70 --> 5755.00]  A total of 77 I-A-I Astra SPXs and Gulfstream G100 aircraft were produced.
[5755.48 --> 5756.00]  So,
[5757.02 --> 5759.12]  and that appears to actually be right,
[5759.42 --> 5760.54]  according to Wikipedia.
[5760.54 --> 5763.54]  So that includes both the original Astra
[5763.54 --> 5765.56]  and the G100,
[5765.56 --> 5768.32]  which had a wider and longer cabin or revised nose and something,
[5768.44 --> 5768.58]  something,
[5768.68 --> 5768.82]  something,
[5768.90 --> 5769.04]  something,
[5769.04 --> 5769.06]  something,
[5769.14 --> 5769.36]  something.
[5769.72 --> 5770.64]  So that was,
[5770.74 --> 5772.18]  they produced those back in,
[5772.30 --> 5775.00]  I think the late eighties or something like that.
[5775.18 --> 5776.28]  Don't quote me on that.
[5776.36 --> 5776.60]  When,
[5776.68 --> 5777.92]  when were these actually produced?
[5778.34 --> 5778.60]  Yeah.
[5778.88 --> 5779.10]  Yeah.
[5779.10 --> 5782.60]  manufactured from 1985 to 2017.
[5783.54 --> 5783.68]  Okay.
[5783.74 --> 5783.86]  No,
[5783.88 --> 5783.96]  no,
[5783.96 --> 5784.08]  no.
[5784.12 --> 5786.06]  So that number is only for the original one,
[5786.10 --> 5786.94]  if I recall correctly.
[5787.40 --> 5787.82]  No,
[5787.90 --> 5788.44]  look at this.
[5789.86 --> 5790.26]  Total.
[5790.26 --> 5794.60]  265 over 30 years.
[5796.04 --> 5797.22]  Like they don't,
[5797.22 --> 5799.78]  they don't make that many of these things.
[5800.16 --> 5802.16]  So getting the spare parts for them,
[5802.30 --> 5806.96]  if the manufacturer is not able or willing to make you one,
[5807.66 --> 5808.86]  you literally,
[5809.74 --> 5811.40]  in a paper Rolodex,
[5811.40 --> 5817.94]  could have the name and number of every single person on earth who owns
[5817.94 --> 5822.94]  another one and who could possibly have that water pump or who knows.
[5823.02 --> 5823.18]  Right.
[5823.22 --> 5823.34]  Like,
[5823.36 --> 5823.64]  I don't know.
[5823.68 --> 5826.12]  I don't know what parts planes have.
[5826.60 --> 5827.04]  So,
[5827.14 --> 5827.28]  yeah.
[5827.38 --> 5827.58]  So,
[5827.58 --> 5828.04]  uh,
[5828.04 --> 5832.46]  current evil set or carnival says that for that Hawker 4,000 that we were
[5832.46 --> 5833.50]  looking at a second ago,
[5833.50 --> 5834.20]  uh,
[5834.20 --> 5834.34]  here,
[5834.42 --> 5835.16]  control shift T.
[5835.24 --> 5836.26]  Let's see if I can bring this back up.
[5836.30 --> 5836.42]  Yeah.
[5836.42 --> 5837.22]  So for this guy,
[5837.30 --> 5839.26]  apparently there were,
[5839.26 --> 5840.42]  uh,
[5840.42 --> 5841.22]  uh,
[5841.34 --> 5845.38]  73 made 73.
[5846.54 --> 5847.96]  So like you,
[5848.22 --> 5853.26]  me and Dan could on our fingers and toes,
[5853.26 --> 5858.12]  almost count the number of these planes that there are in the world,
[5858.12 --> 5859.96]  which I don't know,
[5860.00 --> 5861.00]  just kind of blew my mind.
[5861.00 --> 5861.76]  I just still functional.
[5861.90 --> 5862.50]  We totally could.
[5862.90 --> 5865.10]  I just thought you're probably right.
[5865.54 --> 5866.02]  Yeah.
[5866.06 --> 5866.38]  You're,
[5866.56 --> 5867.00]  you're,
[5867.16 --> 5868.54]  you're probably right.
[5868.54 --> 5872.66]  And you talk to like aviation people and they will literally know like how
[5872.66 --> 5873.96]  many of them are still in service.
[5874.62 --> 5875.02]  Right.
[5875.10 --> 5878.04]  And they can get retired for any number of reasons.
[5878.04 --> 5879.06]  They could crash.
[5879.14 --> 5880.12]  They could just not be worth it.
[5880.66 --> 5881.06]  You,
[5881.14 --> 5882.96]  you hear about this with cars sometimes too,
[5883.02 --> 5884.12]  but I've also heard that it's,
[5884.12 --> 5886.92]  it's sometimes the case where people will literally buy two.
[5886.92 --> 5890.38]  And one of them is literally only purchased as a donor plane.
[5891.38 --> 5891.78]  Yep.
[5892.90 --> 5894.06]  Which is wild.
[5894.06 --> 5897.70]  And sometimes that's not because it's impossible to get a replacement part,
[5897.80 --> 5901.02]  but because it's much faster to have one on hand.
[5901.02 --> 5902.28]  And then you can like,
[5902.76 --> 5906.50]  then take your sweet time going and finding another one for your,
[5906.62 --> 5907.20]  for your store.
[5907.20 --> 5909.20]  So as,
[5909.80 --> 5909.96]  as,
[5909.96 --> 5912.56]  as part of the discussions around that original Astra,
[5912.82 --> 5917.96]  I learned of someone who has a fleet of like three or four of them and a
[5917.96 --> 5920.20]  donor plane so that they just like,
[5920.20 --> 5921.06]  right.
[5921.82 --> 5923.92]  Have spares so they can,
[5924.06 --> 5925.36]  so they can keep the others going.
[5925.38 --> 5926.46]  Cause they're running like a,
[5926.46 --> 5928.08]  like a charter business of some sort.
[5928.42 --> 5929.28]  And I was like,
[5929.30 --> 5931.00]  that sounds super cool.
[5931.00 --> 5931.84]  Um,
[5932.16 --> 5936.04]  I don't think I'm going to be entering the,
[5936.10 --> 5938.88]  the aircraft charter business anytime soon,
[5938.88 --> 5939.74]  but that's like,
[5939.74 --> 5942.00]  that's super cool.
[5942.32 --> 5942.80]  Um,
[5942.96 --> 5944.68]  it's really interesting learning about it.
[5944.72 --> 5947.68]  I never really had an interest in planes,
[5947.68 --> 5948.90]  but the more I learned,
[5949.00 --> 5951.02]  the more interesting it is.
[5951.02 --> 5951.46]  And I just,
[5951.58 --> 5957.56]  I had no idea how small the entire industry was like tiny.
[5958.52 --> 5960.98]  And so I guess it makes sense that these things are,
[5961.00 --> 5961.32]  25,
[5961.50 --> 5962.86]  $30 million brand new.
[5962.96 --> 5967.12]  When you look at a product line that they might have over a span of 30
[5967.12 --> 5967.78]  years and go,
[5967.90 --> 5968.02]  okay,
[5968.06 --> 5968.20]  yeah,
[5968.20 --> 5974.14]  they're going to build 250 of them total over all of those years.
[5974.94 --> 5977.56]  But then I guess a huge part of the money is also in the,
[5977.56 --> 5977.86]  uh,
[5978.20 --> 5979.48]  the maintenance and whatnot.
[5980.74 --> 5983.60]  CJ Hall says that's a freaking setup for planes and a donor.
[5984.38 --> 5984.80]  Yeah,
[5984.80 --> 5985.06]  buddy.
[5987.14 --> 5987.54]  Yeah,
[5987.80 --> 5988.06]  buddy.
[5989.94 --> 5990.54]  All right.
[5991.00 --> 5992.40]  What are we supposed to be doing,
[5992.52 --> 5992.66]  Dan?
[5993.76 --> 5994.32]  Oh,
[5994.36 --> 5995.36]  let's play a fun game.
[5996.24 --> 5997.02]  I know.
[5998.06 --> 5998.58]  Okay.
[5998.58 --> 6005.12]  I am going to start spinning this CPU and I'm going to do all of my sponsor spots before
[6005.12 --> 6005.76]  it stops.
[6006.44 --> 6007.08]  We ready?
[6009.04 --> 6011.10]  The WAN show is brought to you by...
[6011.10 --> 6013.86]  Odoo.
[6013.86 --> 6013.90]  Odoo.
[6013.90 --> 6013.98]  Odoo.
[6013.98 --> 6017.22]  Do you sometimes wish you had more hands at your disposal?
[6017.34 --> 6018.66]  That's really uncomfortable looking.
[6018.76 --> 6018.98]  Okay.
[6019.46 --> 6021.06]  Maybe not that many.
[6021.24 --> 6022.08]  Oh my God.
[6022.16 --> 6023.00]  What were we thinking?
[6023.90 --> 6024.34]  Um,
[6024.34 --> 6026.68]  anyway,
[6026.96 --> 6031.76]  Odoo makes it easy to unify your business's processes into a single platform,

[6064.86 --> 6065.00]  though.
[6065.78 --> 6067.38]  The show is also brought to you by Proton.
[6068.02 --> 6068.82]  Imagine this.
[6069.38 --> 6070.08]  You're on a roll,
[6070.08 --> 6071.52]  sending emails left and right,
[6071.66 --> 6072.96]  feeling positively electric,
[6073.48 --> 6076.48]  but if you're too in the zone and not worried about data breaches,
[6076.84 --> 6077.28]  you either,
[6077.72 --> 6077.94]  A,
[6078.10 --> 6079.54]  probably should worry about them,
[6080.02 --> 6080.48]  or B,
[6080.86 --> 6082.10]  are using ProtonMail.
[6082.74 --> 6087.44]  Their email service prides itself on the absolute bevy of privacy and security features,
[6087.76 --> 6088.58]  like tracker blocking,
[6088.82 --> 6089.52]  password protection,
[6089.94 --> 6090.92]  link click confirmation,
[6091.34 --> 6092.76]  and advanced phishing protection.
[6093.18 --> 6094.50]  And with dark web monitoring,
[6094.66 --> 6099.36]  Proton alerts you if your email or personal info ever shows up on the other side of the internet.
[6099.80 --> 6100.60]  Best of all,
[6100.78 --> 6102.72]  you'll get end-to-end encryption that's so secure,
[6102.72 --> 6104.40]  or even Proton can't see what you're sending.
[6105.16 --> 6107.44]  ProtonMail is part of Proton's larger suite of products,
[6107.60 --> 6110.18]  all focused on privacy and keeping your data where it belongs,
[6110.70 --> 6111.90]  only where you want it to be.

[6119.00 --> 6120.08]  the show is brought to you by Vessi.
[6120.66 --> 6122.74]  Summer does not always mean rain-free,
[6122.92 --> 6125.78]  as we can personally attest to here in Vancouver.
[6126.28 --> 6127.80]  But don't let the rain ruin your fun.
[6128.14 --> 6130.96]  A pair of Vessis on your feet can keep your day moving along,
[6131.18 --> 6132.32]  rain or shine.
[6132.68 --> 6134.10]  Check out their weekend sneakers,
[6134.10 --> 6138.62]  with their fashion-forward design that'll match your fit for those pre-planned patio hangs,
[6138.98 --> 6140.22]  spontaneous beach days,
[6140.38 --> 6142.52]  or your day-to-day errand runs.
[6142.86 --> 6144.24]  They're easy to slip on and off,
[6144.44 --> 6147.42]  and they have a high rebound midsole for extra comfort,
[6147.72 --> 6149.54]  and are also made with eco-conscious materials.
[6149.86 --> 6150.30]  And of course,
[6150.30 --> 6152.86]  they come with Vessi's claim of being 100% waterproof.
[6153.30 --> 6154.82]  They even come with a one-year warranty,
[6155.04 --> 6157.06]  and 30 days of worry-free returns and exchanges.

[6162.64 --> 6165.60]  to get 15% off your first pair today.
[6166.38 --> 6169.02]  I was rocking my Vessis the entire time in West Edmonton Mall.
[6169.02 --> 6172.78]  I think I put probably like 50 plus thousand steps on them over the few days.
[6173.66 --> 6175.00]  We did a lot of mall walking.
[6177.12 --> 6178.26]  Look at that, it's still spinning.
[6178.90 --> 6179.54]  Just about.
[6180.30 --> 6187.22]  Wait, did you start the sponsor segments with a spin?
[6187.44 --> 6187.64]  Yeah.
[6188.78 --> 6189.70]  And it's still going?
[6189.84 --> 6190.70]  Yeah, barely.
[6191.08 --> 6192.24]  That's actually kind of sick.
[6192.28 --> 6193.16]  But it is still going.
[6196.14 --> 6196.80]  Yeah, buddy.
[6197.88 --> 6198.62]  Wait for it.
[6198.62 --> 6199.66]  Wait for it.
[6199.94 --> 6200.62]  Still going.
[6200.76 --> 6201.40]  No, no, it's still going.
[6202.02 --> 6202.56]  It's still going.
[6202.92 --> 6203.32]  It's still going.
[6203.46 --> 6203.78]  It's still going.
[6204.20 --> 6204.88]  It's still going.
[6205.54 --> 6206.26]  It's still going.
[6207.02 --> 6207.42]  Oh!
[6207.56 --> 6207.98]  Ah!
[6208.56 --> 6209.06]  There it is.
[6209.06 --> 6210.34]  I mean, it's still spinning.
[6210.44 --> 6211.44]  I mean, yeah.
[6211.54 --> 6212.50]  Well, I don't call that spinning.
[6212.70 --> 6213.38]  I don't know if it counts.
[6214.32 --> 6215.16]  That's wibble wobbly.
[6215.16 --> 6218.78]  Yes, it counts if you couldn't see me, Seth Jones.
[6220.42 --> 6220.78]  Ah!
[6221.84 --> 6222.20]  Okay.
[6224.58 --> 6224.90]  Um.
[6227.38 --> 6228.72]  DK Rocksmith says,
[6228.72 --> 6230.50]  My merch message glitched out.
[6230.82 --> 6232.90]  Where do you guys get your Linux ISOs?
[6232.90 --> 6235.92]  I'm in the process of digitizing my library and have some that are less than ideal that
[6235.92 --> 6237.58]  I'm wanting to take the path in getting them to digital.
[6238.08 --> 6240.06]  So, I'm not going to answer that question.
[6240.40 --> 6246.20]  But what I will answer is that I came across this super cool article that I actually meant
[6246.20 --> 6247.30]  to add to the WAN show.
[6247.30 --> 6248.10]  Um.
[6248.10 --> 6252.68]  There's a firmware hack that you can do for certain Blu-ray drives.
[6253.36 --> 6253.72]  Um.
[6254.40 --> 6256.90]  Shout out the dedicated people who created this.
[6256.98 --> 6259.40]  Someone's going to link it in the chat because I forget what it's called.
[6259.88 --> 6260.20]  Um.
[6260.20 --> 6263.54]  But basically there's like a firmware update that you can do to certain Blu-ray drives
[6263.54 --> 6269.32]  that just allows them to just read Blu-rays and not worry about encryption or if they're
[6269.32 --> 6271.82]  a UHD Blu-ray or blah blah blah.
[6271.96 --> 6277.24]  It just reads the bits off the thing and you can make MKV them and it's super super awesome.
[6278.14 --> 6278.38]  Uh.
[6278.38 --> 6281.94]  Somebody remind me of what it's called but it's super cool.
[6282.64 --> 6283.06]  Uh.
[6283.12 --> 6285.00]  Nobody is telling me.
[6285.24 --> 6286.12]  Oh well.
[6286.80 --> 6287.20]  Uh.
[6287.20 --> 6288.14]  Someone will.
[6288.14 --> 6290.22]  As always.
[6290.82 --> 6291.18]  Um.
[6291.44 --> 6291.76]  You know.
[6291.98 --> 6293.26]  I remind people to be.
[6293.40 --> 6294.04]  Is it Libra drive?
[6294.12 --> 6294.60]  That might be it.
[6294.72 --> 6295.46]  I think that might be it.
[6296.52 --> 6297.02]  I don't know.
[6297.18 --> 6297.54]  No.
[6297.88 --> 6298.16]  Honestly.
[6298.34 --> 6299.58]  I was reading something else.
[6299.88 --> 6300.00]  Uh.
[6301.16 --> 6301.34]  Yeah.
[6301.44 --> 6304.74]  A Libra drive is a mode of operation of an optical disk drive where the data and all
[6304.74 --> 6306.90]  the disks can be accessed directly without any restrictions.
[6307.24 --> 6309.38]  So best Libra drive compatible Blu-ray drive.
[6309.42 --> 6309.64]  Okay.
[6309.74 --> 6309.90]  Yeah.
[6309.96 --> 6310.48]  So go.
[6310.70 --> 6312.66]  Go down the Libra drive.
[6312.94 --> 6313.46]  Um.
[6313.62 --> 6315.68]  Rabbit hole and you will figure it out.
[6315.68 --> 6322.26]  Once you have a Libra drive drive theoretically you can just huck any Blu-ray in it and it
[6322.26 --> 6323.00]  should be good to go.
[6327.18 --> 6328.02]  Archlinux.org.
[6329.88 --> 6330.54]  Thank you Dan.
[6330.66 --> 6331.24]  Thank you for that.
[6332.14 --> 6332.64]  All right.
[6332.66 --> 6333.66]  What are we supposed to be doing right now?
[6334.60 --> 6335.30]  More topics.
[6335.52 --> 6336.16]  More topics.
[6337.42 --> 6338.06]  Oh man.
[6338.12 --> 6338.56]  How did we.
[6338.64 --> 6340.30]  How did we do so few topics already?
[6340.92 --> 6341.86]  This is terrible.
[6342.60 --> 6343.66]  The show has been on for.
[6343.84 --> 6344.62]  Why does anybody even.
[6344.64 --> 6345.50]  You're not done the announcements.
[6345.80 --> 6347.22]  Why does anybody even watch the show?
[6347.30 --> 6347.76]  We don't even.
[6348.10 --> 6349.82]  We don't even pay attention to what we're supposed to be.
[6349.88 --> 6352.00]  We've been live for two hours and we've done like three topics.
[6352.34 --> 6352.48]  Wait.
[6352.48 --> 6354.00]  Sammy specifically asked us.
[6354.38 --> 6357.98]  Sammy specifically asked us to not do the full-blading announcement after the sponsor
[6357.98 --> 6359.52]  spots and then we're going to do it again.
[6360.18 --> 6362.00]  Well we didn't show the uh the short video.
[6362.24 --> 6363.30]  Well why did you guys do that?
[6363.92 --> 6365.28]  Look what you've done to Sammy.
[6365.96 --> 6368.08]  He's probably crying right now.
[6368.08 --> 6370.92]  I have like 30 unread messages from him.
[6371.14 --> 6371.66]  Do you really?
[6371.84 --> 6373.44]  I'm just going to read them later I think.
[6374.20 --> 6374.78]  You don't.
[6375.00 --> 6375.54]  No I don't.
[6375.70 --> 6375.88]  No.
[6376.04 --> 6376.32]  Okay.
[6376.72 --> 6377.12]  No.
[6377.28 --> 6377.46]  Shoot.
[6377.52 --> 6378.92]  Do I have any unread messages from him?
[6379.20 --> 6381.00]  That wouldn't even surprise me that much.
[6382.00 --> 6382.40]  Uh.
[6383.16 --> 6386.42]  If not I feel like he probably gave up on us.
[6387.36 --> 6388.16]  I would have.
[6388.28 --> 6388.96]  That's possible.
[6389.84 --> 6392.10]  Which is so sad.
[6392.74 --> 6393.28]  This is hilarious.
[6393.40 --> 6395.46]  I had no idea that Sebastian was from Edmonton.
[6395.46 --> 6399.42]  He says couldn't contribute to your Edmonton conversation because I was in the car but hearing
[6399.42 --> 6400.58]  y'all talk about it was hilarious.
[6401.26 --> 6404.48]  Also you've probably spent more time in West Edmonton Mall than me even though I was born
[6404.48 --> 6405.18]  and raised in Edmonton.
[6405.42 --> 6405.78]  That's funny.
[6405.86 --> 6407.44]  My brother hadn't been there yet either.
[6408.30 --> 6409.20]  It's the classic.
[6409.38 --> 6413.40]  It's the classic the locals never do their own local things thing.
[6413.88 --> 6419.14]  Like I honestly think some of the recent conversation around travel and reducing travel has been
[6419.14 --> 6426.00]  really good because it prompts people to like do the things that like Yvonne and I used to
[6426.00 --> 6430.48]  think like oh yeah it's summer we should go away and then we're like what the f*** are we doing?
[6430.66 --> 6432.04]  Why would we go anywhere in summer?
[6432.12 --> 6433.66]  People travel to Vancouver in the summer.
[6433.74 --> 6435.02]  We should go places in the winter.
[6435.72 --> 6436.10]  Like what?
[6436.30 --> 6436.52]  What?
[6436.78 --> 6438.46]  What are we thinking all these years?
[6438.46 --> 6440.94]  Just do things here.
[6442.18 --> 6443.42]  But you don't think of that.
[6443.64 --> 6447.10]  Traveling to more summery locations than Vancouver in the summer kind of sucks.
[6447.20 --> 6448.22]  Like it's death here.
[6448.42 --> 6448.70]  Yeah.
[6448.82 --> 6451.12]  You walk outside and it actually feels like you're in an oven.
[6451.34 --> 6452.38]  It's horrible.
[6453.32 --> 6455.00]  I hate it.
[6455.66 --> 6456.10]  Exactly.
[6456.56 --> 6458.34]  I hate that DEF CON is in Vegas.
[6458.48 --> 6460.30]  I hate that DEF CON is in Vegas in the summer.
[6460.32 --> 6460.88]  Like let's go to it.
[6461.00 --> 6463.72]  Yeah we'll go to Vegas in January during CES.
[6463.72 --> 6466.00]  Like way more pleasant time to go.
[6466.42 --> 6466.98]  Still hot.
[6467.30 --> 6467.58]  Yeah.
[6467.58 --> 6468.02]  Yeah.
[6468.78 --> 6469.18]  Yeah.
[6470.14 --> 6471.02]  Yeah exactly.
[6471.14 --> 6475.50]  Pan Bluch says it's the worst to ask someone local what there is to visit.
[6475.98 --> 6477.40]  I know right?
[6478.10 --> 6481.28]  Like I have to go look it up when people ask me oh what is there to do in Vancouver?
[6481.44 --> 6483.96]  I'm like I'll go play badminton at Smash Champs.
[6485.22 --> 6488.40]  Sit in my computer room at home because that's what I do here.
[6489.44 --> 6490.82]  I don't know what else there is.
[6491.10 --> 6492.02]  Okay there's the grouse grind.
[6492.02 --> 6492.92]  There's the grouse grind.
[6494.84 --> 6497.14]  Which is not as sexy as it sounds.
[6497.58 --> 6501.00]  You can't just say the grouse grind.
[6501.14 --> 6502.58]  There's incredible hiking.
[6502.68 --> 6503.64]  But I love the grouse grind.
[6504.50 --> 6506.56]  Yeah but like the grouse grind is like.
[6506.60 --> 6507.26]  But it's iconic.
[6507.44 --> 6509.94]  Almost like a cardio exercise.
[6510.18 --> 6511.20]  I mean yeah.
[6512.02 --> 6512.50]  It's good for you.
[6512.50 --> 6513.92]  But there's hiking that's like.
[6514.08 --> 6515.10]  You can walk it.
[6515.34 --> 6515.78]  More.
[6516.38 --> 6516.76]  Yeah.
[6517.14 --> 6517.82]  You can walk it.
[6517.82 --> 6518.78]  I don't like steps.
[6518.94 --> 6520.00]  I don't like steps hiking.
[6520.60 --> 6521.00]  Personally.
[6521.64 --> 6522.16]  I mean.
[6522.88 --> 6523.54]  You do have.
[6523.82 --> 6524.88]  I like a mountain raw.
[6524.98 --> 6526.42]  You do have the option to get good.
[6527.22 --> 6528.78]  Like I'm just saying.
[6528.92 --> 6529.40]  I'm just saying.
[6529.68 --> 6531.02]  That's not doing steps.
[6531.02 --> 6531.78]  I'm just saying.
[6531.88 --> 6532.12]  If you.
[6532.20 --> 6533.08]  If you fear the steps.
[6533.10 --> 6534.78]  I'm not saying amount of steps that you take.
[6534.84 --> 6535.98]  You could conquer your fear.
[6535.98 --> 6537.48]  You could conquer your fear.
[6538.12 --> 6538.80]  It's an option.
[6539.50 --> 6540.22]  Of what?
[6540.26 --> 6541.40]  Of steps apparently.
[6542.40 --> 6545.34]  I'm saying I prefer the more difficult type of hiking.
[6545.42 --> 6546.24]  I'm just saying.
[6546.34 --> 6547.18]  I'm just saying.
[6547.38 --> 6547.64]  Luke.
[6548.12 --> 6549.48]  Take it one step at a time.
[6554.88 --> 6555.98]  I'll be there with you.
[6556.08 --> 6556.72]  It'll be okay.
[6556.80 --> 6557.24]  I'll be there.
[6557.28 --> 6557.86]  I'll be there.
[6557.90 --> 6558.84]  I'll be there waiting at the top.
[6558.84 --> 6559.44]  You can go up a step.
[6559.44 --> 6559.84]  Okay.
[6564.92 --> 6566.44]  Well do we do the full play announcement now?
[6566.52 --> 6567.52]  Or do we do a couple topics?
[6567.52 --> 6568.12]  I don't know.
[6568.26 --> 6568.92]  We should do it now.
[6568.98 --> 6569.56]  We should do it now.
[6570.36 --> 6570.62]  Okay.
[6570.78 --> 6571.48]  Guess what?
[6571.94 --> 6572.32]  Folks.
[6573.00 --> 6575.24]  It's Scrapyard Wars Day.
[6575.58 --> 6576.92]  It's going live.
[6577.56 --> 6578.02]  Hold on.
[6578.40 --> 6579.70]  I'm just going to do a thing here real quick.
[6580.46 --> 6581.16]  Here it is.
[6582.60 --> 6583.86]  Scrapyard Wars 10.
[6584.72 --> 6586.10]  This is hilarious.
[6586.60 --> 6588.30]  You and I.
[6588.30 --> 6590.74]  And this is ridiculous.
[6592.34 --> 6592.78]  Anyway.
[6594.78 --> 6595.30]  Cool.
[6596.28 --> 6596.72]  Public.
[6596.74 --> 6597.44]  Not actors.
[6599.14 --> 6600.00]  Release date.
[6600.46 --> 6601.44]  Immediate release.
[6601.54 --> 6602.44]  That's right my friends.
[6602.52 --> 6604.98]  I'm here to bring you immediate release.
[6605.54 --> 6606.30]  It's back.
[6606.56 --> 6607.56]  It's bigger than ever.
[6607.94 --> 6611.92]  Linus and Luke face off to build the ultimate budget home theater gaming setup using just
[6611.92 --> 6614.98]  $1,400 US dollars.
[6614.98 --> 6619.56]  They'll search local listings, thrift stores, back alleys, and online marketplaces to find
[6619.56 --> 6625.50]  the best cheap gaming PCs, 4K TVs, surround sound systems, and use components like CPUs
[6625.50 --> 6626.40]  and GPUs.
[6626.40 --> 6627.14]  The goal?
[6627.60 --> 6631.48]  Create a fully functional home entertainment center for gaming, movie watching, all with
[6631.48 --> 6633.56]  perfect vibes without breaking the bank.
[6633.76 --> 6638.60]  You'll see smart DIY solutions and intense tech rivalries as each team fights for the
[6638.60 --> 6641.44]  best bang for the buck setup to be crowned victor.
[6643.72 --> 6644.28]  Save.
[6644.28 --> 6645.20]  It's live.
[6647.66 --> 6648.62]  I'm excited.
[6649.12 --> 6657.84]  Also, also, each episode will have extras as we have a combined total of 50 hours of
[6657.84 --> 6660.28]  footage, not including screen recording.
[6661.02 --> 6665.64]  Oh, Sammy says, let's also make the behind the scenes slash extras live now.
[6666.02 --> 6667.94]  So I guess I will do that.
[6668.46 --> 6669.06]  Here's extra.
[6669.22 --> 6669.86]  Okay.
[6670.86 --> 6671.80]  I get it.
[6671.80 --> 6671.86]  I get it.
[6671.86 --> 6672.86]  Okay.
[6676.94 --> 6677.86]  So that's public now.
[6678.06 --> 6678.20]  I like it.
[6678.60 --> 6679.28]  You know what?
[6679.34 --> 6679.90]  I'll allow it.
[6680.18 --> 6680.84]  I'll allow it.
[6682.28 --> 6684.18]  What else am I supposed to say about this?
[6685.26 --> 6690.18]  While you're there, we're looking for your creative ideas to include in our next Floatplane
[6690.18 --> 6692.80]  X Creator Warehouse merch drop, which will be a poster.
[6693.42 --> 6697.34]  Leave your comments on the behind the scenes, I guess?
[6697.34 --> 6699.86]  Leave your comments there and we'll gather some ideas.
[6699.92 --> 6700.30]  Oh, no, no.
[6700.36 --> 6701.04]  There's a link.
[6701.04 --> 6705.88]  We'll gather some ideas to make a sick poster for our Floatplane subs on a stream with Sarah
[6705.88 --> 6706.62]  featuring Sammy.
[6707.18 --> 6708.96]  And then the link is here.
[6709.20 --> 6711.18]  So you want to go here.
[6711.42 --> 6713.80]  We need your ideas post under Floatplane exclusives.
[6714.56 --> 6715.04]  There you go.
[6715.38 --> 6716.92]  We need your ideas right there.
[6717.26 --> 6717.54]  All right.
[6717.58 --> 6717.76]  Cool.
[6717.88 --> 6721.40]  I think that's it for the Floatplane announcements.
[6721.40 --> 6726.54]  All of these are exclusive for subscribers at lmg.gg slash floatplane.
[6726.54 --> 6729.08]  So yeah, don't worry.
[6729.08 --> 6732.18]  Scrapyard Wars will come to YouTube, but not yet.
[6732.98 --> 6736.44]  So there's going to be early access for the entire Scrapyard Wars 10.
[6736.80 --> 6737.56]  It's going to be great.
[6738.26 --> 6738.70]  All right.
[6738.74 --> 6739.70]  What are we supposed to be doing now?
[6740.64 --> 6741.34]  More topics.
[6741.44 --> 6742.56]  You're more topics.
[6742.96 --> 6743.22]  Boom.
[6743.32 --> 6744.12]  Got them.
[6744.12 --> 6752.04]  Tesla loses $240 million in an autopilot wrongful death case.
[6752.04 --> 6757.28]  A Florida jury has found Tesla partly liable for a 2019 crash involving its autopilot driver
[6757.28 --> 6762.10]  assistance system, awarding a total of $242.5 million in damages, making this one of the
[6762.10 --> 6766.84]  first major legal decisions to go against Tesla over its driver assist tech.
[6766.84 --> 6771.60]  The crash killed one pedestrian and severely injured another after the driver, distracted
[6771.60 --> 6775.40]  by his phone while on enhanced autopilot, assumed the car would stop.
[6775.96 --> 6779.72]  Instead, it went through the intersection at over 60 miles an hour, hit an SUV, and struck
[6779.72 --> 6780.88]  the pedestrians on foot.
[6781.38 --> 6786.28]  The jury pinned two-thirds of the blame on the driver and one-third on Tesla, pointing
[6786.28 --> 6790.30]  to autopilot being built for highways but not locked out from other roads.
[6790.76 --> 6790.98]  Yep.
[6791.78 --> 6795.20]  Musk publicly claiming that autopilot drove better than humans.
[6795.48 --> 6796.70]  That is a direct quote.
[6797.20 --> 6803.20]  And Tesla's history of brushing off NTSB safety recommendations after earlier fatal crashes.
[6804.18 --> 6808.34]  It is a tough question because the whole better than humans thing could technically still
[6808.34 --> 6808.90]  be true.
[6809.04 --> 6812.76]  I mean, yeah, if he was on his phone, it might have been, maybe two people would have been
[6812.76 --> 6813.00]  dead.
[6813.76 --> 6815.80]  There are absolutely humans that do this.
[6815.90 --> 6818.44]  There are humans that drive through intersections and smack into people.
[6819.64 --> 6819.90]  Yep.
[6821.06 --> 6821.34]  Yeah.
[6821.42 --> 6826.42]  Tesla said it will appeal, calling the verdict wrong and warning that it could set back
[6826.42 --> 6830.28]  industry-wide efforts to deploy life-saving automation while maintaining that no car then
[6830.28 --> 6831.90]  or now could have avoided the crash.
[6831.90 --> 6841.82]  Legal experts say this could open the floodgates for more lawsuits against Tesla and other automakers, especially as ADAS features spread.
[6841.82 --> 6843.46]  I mean, yeah.
[6843.46 --> 6845.48]  I can't be immune to it, so something's going to happen.
[6845.52 --> 6849.56]  How did this take so long is, I think, my main discussion question here.
[6849.56 --> 6856.48]  Because the way, and I've been saying this for so many years, I don't object to the technology
[6856.48 --> 6857.52]  that Tesla's building.
[6857.68 --> 6859.62]  In fact, it's pretty cool.
[6860.00 --> 6863.20]  What I object to is the way that they have marketed it.
[6863.66 --> 6868.64]  Calling it autopilot makes it sound like a lot more than what it actually is.
[6869.42 --> 6875.40]  Calling it full self-driving, even if it's a beta, makes it sound a lot more capable than
[6875.40 --> 6879.68]  what it actually is and the way that they have deceptively marketed these products.
[6880.22 --> 6886.60]  I mean, their most recent defense in California against the false advertising claim was,
[6887.12 --> 6889.08]  well, we've been doing it this long and no one said anything.
[6889.46 --> 6891.34]  They didn't even deny it was false advertising.
[6892.52 --> 6895.20]  How has this been excused for so long?
[6895.20 --> 6898.50]  And why did it take so long for this reckoning?
[6898.50 --> 6905.14]  Because it has significantly caused people to overestimate the capabilities of these systems
[6905.14 --> 6907.10]  and in some cases with fatal consequences.
[6907.52 --> 6913.54]  I just, I, like I said, I don't object to the cool tech that Tesla's building, but I don't
[6913.54 --> 6917.60]  respect the way that they have marketed their products and the way that they have overrepresented
[6917.60 --> 6917.92]  them.
[6918.16 --> 6920.40]  And actions have consequences.
[6921.14 --> 6925.10]  This time it's $240 million and there's probably going to be more.
[6925.10 --> 6930.50]  You can doge a wrench, but can you doge a fine?
[6931.00 --> 6932.18]  Says Hamnetics.
[6934.42 --> 6935.44]  Oh man.
[6935.72 --> 6937.62]  If you had enough doge, you could doge a fine.
[6939.28 --> 6942.32]  I mean, not wrong.
[6942.72 --> 6943.36]  Not wrong.
[6943.42 --> 6949.16]  If you didn't have a falling out with the, with the tweeter in chief, then you might be
[6949.16 --> 6949.98]  able to doge a fine.
[6950.90 --> 6951.16]  Yeah.
[6951.50 --> 6953.30]  I just really don't, I don't.
[6955.10 --> 6957.88]  Obviously this isn't done yet.
[6958.40 --> 6962.74]  You know, there's going to be, there's going to be plenty of appealness.
[6963.02 --> 6966.28]  I mean, this is probably going to make it all the way to the Supreme court just because
[6966.28 --> 6970.50]  of the, I think that Tesla's not wrong.
[6970.72 --> 6976.08]  The, the, the cooling effect that this could have on development in the industry could be
[6976.08 --> 6976.86]  very strong.
[6976.86 --> 6982.74]  But Tesla has nobody to blame for that, but themselves for recklessly rolling this out
[6982.74 --> 6986.42]  before it was actually ready and recklessly misrepresenting its capabilities.
[6987.04 --> 6992.24]  So this is, this is one of those things where it's like, I don't know, what kind of a parallel
[6992.24 --> 6993.32]  can you draw to this?
[6993.52 --> 6993.84]  Also, would it?
[6994.04 --> 6999.00]  Because like their, their, their market isn't only America.
[6999.00 --> 7004.92]  Like they, they, we talked, I think it was last show about Tesla competing in that automated
[7004.92 --> 7006.72]  driving thing that was in China.
[7007.92 --> 7010.58]  There's clearly a lot of cars that they sell in China.
[7010.78 --> 7011.38]  That's true.
[7011.46 --> 7014.60]  But America is a major world market.
[7014.60 --> 7021.50]  And like, if you could potentially face a quarter billion dollar fine when something goes wrong,
[7021.62 --> 7025.66]  I think, I think it might slow down the rollout.
[7026.36 --> 7028.42]  I don't think it would slow down the work.
[7028.42 --> 7029.52]  If that makes sense.
[7029.64 --> 7033.66]  I mean, the work will only be done if they can roll it out and profit from it though.
[7033.82 --> 7034.14]  Ultimately.
[7035.42 --> 7035.94]  Exactly.
[7036.60 --> 7037.06]  Yeah.
[7037.10 --> 7041.24]  Unique username says, yeah, what Tesla does is harmful for the entire industry, harming
[7041.24 --> 7042.54]  confidence in tech across brands.
[7042.54 --> 7047.08]  I mean, I, I hate to even say this, but the closest parallel that I can really think of
[7047.08 --> 7057.76]  here is Tesla is the false claimant going, well, if you punish me for saying something
[7057.76 --> 7060.74]  that wasn't true, then that's going to harm the whole me too movement.
[7061.72 --> 7067.12]  That's Tesla's role here is they were a bad faith actor who things up.
[7067.30 --> 7070.40]  And then they're sitting here going, but think of the consequences.
[7070.40 --> 7073.58]  Well, yeah, maybe you should have thought of that.
[7074.20 --> 7074.60]  Yeah.
[7075.24 --> 7080.26]  Cause like, I want the industry to move forward.
[7080.40 --> 7086.88]  I want the industry working to build public trust and work with regulatory bodies to roll
[7086.88 --> 7088.58]  this out in a responsible way.
[7088.58 --> 7091.32]  And you fucked it up.
[7093.18 --> 7094.28]  And like, I don't know.
[7094.34 --> 7096.04]  I feel like a broken record at this point.
[7096.12 --> 7098.56]  It's like, it's one of those things where I feel like this is going to be yet another
[7098.56 --> 7102.06]  WAN show where the comments are full of like, why is just hating on Elon Musk?
[7102.32 --> 7107.48]  I don't hate the guy, but I can absolutely hate the way that he approached this.
[7108.00 --> 7108.94]  And I called it.
[7108.94 --> 7109.52]  You don't hate Elon?
[7109.80 --> 7110.84]  I was right.
[7110.98 --> 7111.56]  I don't know him.
[7111.56 --> 7114.30]  I hate a lot of stuff he's done.
[7114.50 --> 7114.72]  Fair enough.
[7114.88 --> 7117.30]  I guess you hate his, his public image.
[7117.96 --> 7118.88]  I don't even know.
[7119.08 --> 7121.50]  I mean, I don't respect it.
[7121.58 --> 7122.62]  I'll say that much.
[7122.94 --> 7124.16]  Hate's an awful strong word.
[7124.26 --> 7128.74]  I don't think I, I don't think I can think of too many people that I, that I hate.
[7128.92 --> 7131.16]  Like hate is, hate's really strong, man.
[7131.16 --> 7137.68]  Um, but like, I, I don't respect, I don't respect thinking that you're above the law
[7137.68 --> 7139.84]  and thinking that you're not accountable to anybody.
[7140.02 --> 7141.22]  Literal lives are at stake.
[7142.06 --> 7146.02]  And the irresponsible, I mean, and I've, and I called it so long ago.
[7146.42 --> 7147.92]  I was like, this will happen.
[7148.10 --> 7149.80]  And then I don't even, not even happy.
[7149.86 --> 7150.28]  I'm right.
[7151.38 --> 7155.04]  Like, this isn't like you getting to be right about the cool stuff that you're always right
[7155.04 --> 7155.34]  about.
[7155.62 --> 7156.46]  This sucks.
[7156.72 --> 7158.30]  I don't want to be right about this.
[7158.30 --> 7161.84]  I don't know if everything that I've, I've guessed is cool.
[7162.02 --> 7162.48]  Yeah, I know.
[7162.54 --> 7164.70]  Some of the stuff you've been right about is pretty uncool.
[7164.78 --> 7165.14]  Actually.
[7165.56 --> 7166.96]  I don't, I don't know if you meet someone.
[7167.54 --> 7167.94]  Sorry.
[7168.14 --> 7168.62]  No, go ahead.
[7169.40 --> 7169.96]  I did.
[7170.00 --> 7175.58]  I did meet someone here who talked about my whole, um, bringing it back the mainframe
[7175.58 --> 7175.98]  thing.
[7176.76 --> 7179.62]  Um, I was, I was talking about AI stuff for a second.
[7179.72 --> 7185.76]  He was talking about how his, his company who in this case will remain nameless is like doing
[7185.76 --> 7187.70]  that whole song and dance right now.
[7187.70 --> 7193.50]  Um, they're building like many, many, many millions of dollars, tens, maybe hundreds
[7193.50 --> 7194.16]  of millions of dollars.
[7194.16 --> 7194.96]  Like on-prem.
[7195.84 --> 7198.46]  Doing on-prem LLM stuff.
[7198.54 --> 7199.56]  Dude, you called it so hard.
[7200.06 --> 7201.38]  It's not necessarily to do training.
[7201.66 --> 7206.96]  It's because definitely nothing that they do ever can go out of house.
[7207.10 --> 7207.28]  Yep.
[7207.56 --> 7211.70]  And they're seeing, you know, productivity advancements happening in the market and they're
[7211.70 --> 7213.00]  not getting them.
[7213.10 --> 7215.26]  So they're like, okay, this is what we're doing now.
[7215.44 --> 7215.62]  Yep.
[7215.62 --> 7217.22]  And he was like, yeah, you called it.
[7217.26 --> 7221.36]  And I was like, yeah, I think, I think we both get to be right on that one.
[7221.36 --> 7221.60]  Right.
[7222.58 --> 7223.66]  Cause that's probably fair.
[7223.78 --> 7224.64]  It was a discussion.
[7224.76 --> 7225.02]  Really.
[7225.02 --> 7229.54]  You remember all the crap that I was taking back when I put like a storage servers on-prem,
[7230.06 --> 7233.10]  like way back when we built like the vault and stuff.
[7233.52 --> 7234.66]  Dude, I took so much.
[7234.66 --> 7236.08]  And now all the creators are doing it.
[7236.08 --> 7240.52]  I took so much flack for not using the cloud for everything.
[7240.64 --> 7243.56]  And I was like, bro, this is so obvious.
[7243.56 --> 7245.80]  I pay for it one time.
[7246.92 --> 7249.70]  There's, there's, there's no ingest fees.
[7249.82 --> 7253.92]  There's no takeout fees that I just pay for it one time.
[7253.92 --> 7256.96]  And all I'm putting on it is crap that I ultimately don't really care about.
[7257.02 --> 7257.64]  It's archival.
[7257.78 --> 7258.56]  It doesn't really matter.
[7258.56 --> 7261.42]  And I took so much flack for it, man.
[7261.56 --> 7264.48]  Cause everyone was going clouds, cloud, it's hyper convergence.
[7264.72 --> 7265.28]  It's this, it's that.
[7265.44 --> 7266.54]  Oh my God.
[7267.10 --> 7269.92]  I just want a NAS to calm down.
[7271.76 --> 7275.28]  And it seems like, it seems like everyone is bringing stuff back prem.
[7275.52 --> 7276.90]  I didn't back on prem.
[7277.00 --> 7278.52]  I didn't see compute coming though.
[7279.24 --> 7281.68]  Like I didn't, I, I, I saw storage.
[7281.68 --> 7283.34]  Storage was just kind of obvious to me.
[7283.38 --> 7286.18]  Cause it's so not simple.
[7286.18 --> 7289.08]  Like you, you need to be qualified to administer it properly.
[7289.20 --> 7291.20]  Obviously we had those data rod issues with the vault.
[7291.54 --> 7295.32]  Like it's not simple, but it is, it's relatively simple.
[7295.48 --> 7298.80]  Whereas I think the kinds of deployments that you're talking about are very
[7298.80 --> 7302.88]  unsimple, especially with modern hardware, having the kinds of power and
[7302.88 --> 7304.16]  cooling requirements that it does.
[7304.16 --> 7305.94]  Like you have to, you have to architect this.
[7307.46 --> 7310.42]  Like one of the, one of the parts of the discussion was talking about how
[7310.42 --> 7314.54]  he's part of the, the new like local infrastructure team.
[7314.98 --> 7315.38]  Right.
[7316.18 --> 7321.82]  And how that's like not super normal now, considering he doesn't actually work
[7321.82 --> 7322.46]  at a data center.
[7322.66 --> 7328.70]  He worked, he works at like, you know, the amount of money going into it might
[7328.70 --> 7331.98]  make it sound like a data center externally, but it's like really not.
[7332.06 --> 7337.02]  It's, it's a, it's amazing how, how not far $10 million goes these days.
[7337.20 --> 7338.22]  Yeah, exactly.
[7338.36 --> 7338.66]  Yeah.
[7338.66 --> 7341.62]  It's a, it's a very sizable server room.
[7343.10 --> 7347.46]  And, and he has like himself and a very small team and they're, they're managing
[7347.46 --> 7347.68]  it.
[7347.68 --> 7349.08]  And it's just, it's interesting.
[7349.08 --> 7352.40]  Cause this is like how things worked when you and I were getting into the
[7352.40 --> 7352.66]  industry.
[7352.66 --> 7354.28]  And then it kind of stopped being that way.
[7354.34 --> 7354.82]  Everything.
[7355.00 --> 7358.58]  It was the, the same, like nobody got fired for buying IBM.
[7358.58 --> 7361.46]  It was like, nobody got fired for moving things to the cloud.
[7362.06 --> 7366.44]  Um, and then now it's, it's starting to come back, which is, which is cool.
[7367.14 --> 7368.46]  It's medical is my guess.
[7368.86 --> 7370.76]  Uh, I can't say yes or no.
[7371.42 --> 7372.60]  It's a good guess though.
[7372.60 --> 7377.34]  That is one of the fields that, um, would be doing this type of thing.
[7377.34 --> 7379.18]  Medical, legal, military.
[7379.50 --> 7382.00]  There's plenty of reasons that you would want to have on-prem.
[7382.92 --> 7383.16]  Yep.
[7383.64 --> 7383.90]  Yep.
[7384.26 --> 7390.46]  Big, massive, big money companies that need to be able to move efficiently
[7390.46 --> 7391.58]  because everyone does.
[7392.02 --> 7396.94]  Um, and there is no possible chance that the stuff that they're working on
[7396.94 --> 7398.86]  can go public at any time.
[7399.10 --> 7403.88]  And then it's like, okay, well, you can't use these public, like opening
[7403.88 --> 7405.38]  eye chat bot models then.
[7405.38 --> 7408.70]  Um, although, you know, they did just announce that they're open sourcing
[7408.70 --> 7412.56]  some stuff, but, um, you can't use the, the traditional log into the website
[7412.56 --> 7413.52]  type system.
[7415.68 --> 7421.12]  Um, Seth Jones bringing us back just a little bit said in float plane chat
[7421.12 --> 7424.08]  says, does the way that Tesla over promises their tech at all mirror what
[7424.08 --> 7427.32]  the current, uh, AI industry is doing with AI tools?
[7427.56 --> 7431.40]  Will we see, or we will see real health impacts as people listen to these AI
[7431.40 --> 7432.46]  tools for things like medical care.
[7432.52 --> 7432.88]  Absolutely.
[7432.88 --> 7436.66]  And that's one of the reasons that Luke and I talk about that so much as well,
[7436.66 --> 7442.30]  because it's not that we are like amazing soothsayers with incredible crystal
[7442.30 --> 7442.74]  balls.
[7442.74 --> 7445.88]  It's just that it's so bloody obvious.
[7445.88 --> 7454.80]  And it feels like lawmakers move at glacial speed sometimes when it's clear that decisive,
[7455.30 --> 7458.64]  quick action needs to be taken to deal with this stuff.
[7459.52 --> 7461.88]  And it's, it's so frustrating.
[7462.68 --> 7465.58]  Um, you know, I don't, I don't know, I don't know how to fix that.
[7465.58 --> 7471.28]  Like, how do you, how do you force politicians to pick up a f***ing, you know, newspaper?
[7471.98 --> 7472.40]  Right?
[7472.46 --> 7474.44]  I can't expect them to read online apparently.
[7474.84 --> 7485.58]  Well, it's tough because of how many of them, uh, it's not their thing.
[7485.58 --> 7488.56]  Um, how do I, how do I say this?
[7490.02 --> 7501.02]  Um, a lot of company, uh, country leadership all over the place is just like extremely
[7501.02 --> 7503.18]  geriatric just to be blunt.
[7503.30 --> 7503.48]  Yeah.
[7503.48 --> 7512.12]  Um, and it's like when, when like cars becoming a thing was like a big thing in your life.
[7512.44 --> 7515.56]  Um, LLMs might not exactly be top of mind right now.
[7515.64 --> 7516.24]  It just.
[7516.72 --> 7521.30]  When you went to school and used chalk and paper.
[7521.58 --> 7522.00]  On slate.
[7522.52 --> 7522.80]  Yeah.
[7522.92 --> 7523.18]  Like.
[7523.54 --> 7523.86]  Yeah.
[7524.18 --> 7526.20]  Like, damn, dude.
[7529.28 --> 7530.12]  Come on.
[7530.12 --> 7534.48]  This is, this is a big part of why Lina Khan was cool is.
[7534.76 --> 7535.16]  Yeah.
[7536.84 --> 7543.92]  Literally just because this is more of the stuff that like she grew up with as the topical thing
[7543.92 --> 7544.46]  at the time.
[7544.54 --> 7549.68]  I'd like to once again, extend an invitation to Lina Khan to come move to Canada and be our
[7549.68 --> 7550.14]  prime minister.
[7551.02 --> 7551.46]  Yeah.
[7551.46 --> 7555.86]  I'm just saying I will personally run your campaign to be prime minister of Canada.
[7556.82 --> 7558.90]  Um, I'll volunteer to be clear.
[7558.90 --> 7563.66]  I don't think Carney's done anything particularly egregiously offensive to me yet.
[7564.54 --> 7567.08]  Um, I just rather Lina.
[7567.70 --> 7568.84]  We're on a first name basis.
[7569.16 --> 7570.02]  I call her Lina.
[7570.38 --> 7571.30]  Oh yeah.
[7571.40 --> 7571.66]  Okay.
[7571.78 --> 7572.00]  Yeah.
[7572.96 --> 7574.00]  She calls me Linus.
[7575.00 --> 7575.56]  It's our thing.
[7575.56 --> 7586.16]  Um, unify OS server enters early access.
[7586.72 --> 7592.58]  Ubiquity released unify OS server, which allows users to self-host the entire unify stack on
[7592.58 --> 7593.20]  their own hardware.
[7593.20 --> 7595.80]  TLDR on the need for this.
[7595.80 --> 7601.74]  Um, if you have a unify ecosystem like wireless access points, unify cameras, um, access control,
[7601.74 --> 7606.52]  um, this allows you to bring your own hardware instead of buying a cloud device or multiple
[7606.52 --> 7608.36]  cloud devices for you or your clients.
[7609.10 --> 7612.22]  Um, or not necessarily cloud, but like a controller devices.
[7612.76 --> 7616.76]  Um, installing and owning a unify controller isn't necessarily new.
[7616.76 --> 7618.72]  It's gone through several revisions over the years.
[7618.82 --> 7623.24]  They've had dedicated hardware like the cloud key, um, which I think was only about a hundred
[7623.24 --> 7624.30]  dollars when it was released.
[7624.56 --> 7627.64]  It had just two gigs of RAM and a slow quad core SOC.
[7627.76 --> 7631.90]  Uh, they also have beefy dedicated hardware like the cloud key enterprise, uh, the dream
[7631.90 --> 7635.28]  machine, if I recall correctly, can also act as a unify controller.
[7635.74 --> 7639.74]  Um, and then it determines like how many unified devices you can manage, how powerful your
[7639.74 --> 7640.36]  controller is.
[7640.36 --> 7641.88]  But this is super cool.
[7641.88 --> 7644.08]  Now you can just like bring your own hardware.
[7644.52 --> 7648.70]  Uh, the requirement for the unify OS server are a minimum of 20 gigs of free space.
[7649.26 --> 7654.86]  Um, WSL, Windows subsystem for Linux V2 or Linux podman 4.3.1 plus.
[7655.76 --> 7659.68]  Um, the biggest reason this is exciting is that the old unify software that was available
[7659.68 --> 7663.90]  on computers could only host unifying network to manage things like wifi, but this is now
[7663.90 --> 7668.42]  adding unify identity, which controls user access to buildings and such.
[7669.02 --> 7669.92]  Super cool.
[7670.36 --> 7672.22]  So you could just like have it run in a VM.
[7672.48 --> 7677.16]  You could make it super resilient and have failover or high availability or whatever
[7677.16 --> 7677.82]  else you can do.
[7677.82 --> 7682.74]  Anything you can do with a computer that you can administer on prem with your own hardware.
[7682.74 --> 7689.22]  And that is just super cool for a company that still somehow has not transitioned to a
[7689.22 --> 7690.06]  subscription model.
[7690.52 --> 7695.30]  Not only are they not going subscription model with their networking hardware, but they are
[7695.30 --> 7698.68]  even letting you bring some of your own hardware instead of buying it from them.
[7698.68 --> 7701.44]  as long as you buy a whole bunch of their other hardware.
[7702.24 --> 7709.58]  Unify or ubiquity, excuse me, has such an enlightened approach to how much of their hardware I should
[7709.58 --> 7710.74]  be forced to buy.
[7710.92 --> 7712.60]  The answer is zero.
[7712.60 --> 7717.06]  I should be forced to buy zero of your hardware.
[7717.06 --> 7721.06]  Apple, I already bought your AirPods Pro 2s.
[7721.06 --> 7724.50]  I shouldn't need another Apple device to monitor my battery life on it.
[7724.50 --> 7733.96]  Ubiquity seems to embrace that.
[7733.96 --> 7735.32]  I buy the access point.
[7735.40 --> 7736.64]  It should just work.
[7737.36 --> 7741.74]  Now I can bring my own controller hardware because at the end of the day, I bought the
[7741.74 --> 7742.60]  access point.
[7742.60 --> 7744.60]  I am your customer.
[7744.60 --> 7747.36]  It's super based.
[7748.36 --> 7749.60]  And I like it.
[7752.24 --> 7753.94]  Good job, Ubiquity.
[7755.00 --> 7757.04]  Sorry, I sound like angry, but I'm happy.
[7761.56 --> 7763.44]  Sorry, what's Hamnetics talking about?
[7764.80 --> 7765.48]  Oh, no, never mind.
[7765.86 --> 7766.58]  All right.
[7766.58 --> 7775.56]  Oh, Google claims that AI isn't killing website clicks, but you sure about that?
[7776.36 --> 7778.98]  No, David wanted me to do a Tim Robinson voice.
[7779.16 --> 7780.70]  I forget the voice.
[7780.80 --> 7781.30]  I'm sorry.
[7781.88 --> 7787.48]  After a report from the Pew Research Center backed up claims from SEO experts that AI
[7787.48 --> 7792.18]  summaries are causing a massive reduction in click through to websites of nearly 50% via
[7792.18 --> 7798.12]  search engines, head of Google search Liz Reed responded in a blog post that said third-party
[7798.12 --> 7803.16]  reports were based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that
[7803.16 --> 7805.48]  occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in search.
[7806.94 --> 7812.58]  She further actually that total organic click volume from Google search to websites has been
[7812.58 --> 7817.76]  relatively stable year over year and average click quality has increased.
[7817.76 --> 7822.78]  The problem with all of this is that while Pew Research Center, not to mention our friends
[7822.78 --> 7828.14]  over at, oh God, I forget, House Fresh.
[7828.36 --> 7829.16]  That was close.
[7829.72 --> 7834.02]  Also, I think the anecdotal evidence of most people using Google.
[7834.76 --> 7835.04]  Yeah.
[7835.18 --> 7840.60]  So Pew Research Center and our friends over at House Fresh brought the data.
[7840.60 --> 7852.54]  But Liz Reed brought some words with no data to back this up other than trust me, bro, which
[7852.54 --> 7860.54]  I think Google at this point has kind of utilized their full allocation of how many bro trust
[7860.54 --> 7861.40]  me's they get.
[7861.40 --> 7867.84]  Um, so I'd love to see, I'd love to see Google actually, actually bring the, bring the data
[7867.84 --> 7868.18]  here.
[7868.90 --> 7876.96]  Um, however, what I will say is that my personal habits, especially now that I've started using
[7876.96 --> 7882.76]  AI a little bit more and had such serious problems with it are shifting in a big way.
[7882.86 --> 7888.24]  So I will read an AI summary and now I won't just click through one source.
[7888.24 --> 7893.34]  I'll actually click through more than one is something that I've noticed myself doing,
[7893.44 --> 7895.34]  especially over the last couple of weeks.
[7895.48 --> 7897.26]  Now all of a sudden, trust stuff less.
[7897.48 --> 7899.14]  I trust everything less now.
[7899.32 --> 7906.24]  Like the AI summary has eroded my trust, not only in the AI summary, but even in the sources
[7906.24 --> 7908.74]  that it is citing, if that makes sense.
[7909.70 --> 7910.22]  Yeah.
[7910.46 --> 7912.88]  I have no bro trust left, Luke.
[7912.88 --> 7919.78]  So, and I don't know if my behavior, like, is anyone else feeling the same way as anyone?
[7919.86 --> 7923.28]  I saw Dan nodding, but like, is anyone else behaving this way?
[7923.58 --> 7923.70]  Yeah.
[7923.74 --> 7924.60]  I've been doing that too.
[7924.84 --> 7927.22]  It's really weird to hear somebody else is doing that too.
[7927.52 --> 7927.72]  Yeah.
[7929.20 --> 7934.04]  Sometimes I just want the AI summary stuff sometimes, but I don't trust it.
[7935.64 --> 7936.04]  Weird.
[7936.58 --> 7938.16]  Why is that the natural progression of this?
[7938.16 --> 7943.18]  Bubbly Charizard asks, is there a limit on the trust me bro warranties?
[7943.26 --> 7946.62]  You have already used a bunch with the single layer backpack issues.
[7946.92 --> 7949.94]  I'm not really sure what you mean by using a bunch.
[7950.40 --> 7957.42]  What we did was we offered a remedy and then we offered a virtual second layer such that
[7957.42 --> 7961.18]  if the first layer wears through on one that doesn't have the two layers, then you contact
[7961.18 --> 7963.22]  us and we fix it or get a replacement.
[7963.22 --> 7966.38]  That's, I'm sorry.
[7966.46 --> 7967.46]  I'm just a hundred percent.
[7967.56 --> 7969.48]  Not sure if I understand your question.
[7969.64 --> 7973.68]  And then our, our, our limited lifetime warranty for the backpack is laid out on our site.
[7975.28 --> 7976.88]  Um, so yeah, anyone else?
[7977.00 --> 7982.02]  I literally just don't believe anything made after 2023 says crusty trombone.
[7984.32 --> 7985.70]  Is that where we're headed?
[7985.70 --> 7995.34]  Like, dude, I, I don't even, I don't even, I would occasionally, very occasionally, let's
[7995.34 --> 8000.94]  say once every six months, I would open up Facebook so that I could browse my incredible
[8000.94 --> 8005.76]  Facebook marketplace algorithm and I would start scrolling like the main feed and I'd
[8005.76 --> 8007.72]  like watch some videos or something.
[8007.72 --> 8013.42]  I straight up don't even bother anymore because I'm so sure that so much of what I'm looking
[8013.42 --> 8013.94]  at is fake.
[8014.84 --> 8015.36]  Yeah.
[8015.38 --> 8018.72]  Like, is it all just ruined at this point?
[8019.82 --> 8023.36]  The internet is kind of a dumpster fire right now.
[8023.80 --> 8027.98]  Um, and I don't think there's going to be much undoing it.
[8028.54 --> 8034.38]  Parallelogram says I've had professors who will not allow sources unless they were pre COVID
[8034.38 --> 8036.96]  because so many of the newer ones are fake.
[8037.68 --> 8038.12]  What?
[8038.50 --> 8038.72]  Yeah.
[8039.62 --> 8041.46]  No, that actually completely makes sense to me.
[8042.50 --> 8044.54]  It's, um, it's rough.
[8044.66 --> 8048.52]  I think, you know how the, I've mentioned this a couple of times on Wayne's show, but you
[8048.52 --> 8054.90]  know how the, the like crypto bros, um, tried to say that blockchain, blockchain was web
[8054.90 --> 8055.26]  four.
[8056.76 --> 8061.50]  I think AI garbage might be effectively web four because that's sad.
[8062.22 --> 8064.36]  Why do you, is this a competition?
[8064.88 --> 8068.86]  Are you just trying to find something worse to be right about than what I was right about?
[8068.94 --> 8069.22]  Yeah, maybe.
[8069.64 --> 8073.06]  Cause like, I think you're right, but like, wow.
[8073.06 --> 8076.00]  I don't know the actual rules for like how those iterations happen.
[8076.10 --> 8077.26]  I don't know that there really are.
[8077.26 --> 8079.30]  Here's a, here's a colored metal.
[8080.98 --> 8081.42]  Yeah.
[8081.54 --> 8081.96]  Yeah, really.
[8082.10 --> 8082.26]  Yeah.
[8083.28 --> 8090.08]  Um, cause like, I, I think to me, it's always like how using the internet now feels significantly
[8090.08 --> 8090.54]  different.
[8090.54 --> 8093.66]  That's the way that I've seen like web one, web two, web three.
[8093.94 --> 8097.88]  Each one of those line up for me as in the way that I use and interact with the internet
[8097.88 --> 8100.50]  significantly changed around this time.
[8100.86 --> 8106.66]  Um, and blockchain didn't do almost anything for that for the vast majority of people.
[8106.66 --> 8115.02]  But AI garbage has massively changed how people interact with the internet and how people perceive
[8115.02 --> 8115.52]  the internet.
[8115.72 --> 8117.64]  Both of those things have massively changed.
[8118.46 --> 8121.48]  Um, yeah.
[8121.48 --> 8127.22]  One of our discussion questions on this one is, uh, what's your favorite alternative search
[8127.22 --> 8128.86]  engine present or past?
[8129.24 --> 8131.78]  Uh, um, it's a web three, baby.
[8134.22 --> 8134.62]  Nice.
[8135.30 --> 8142.30]  Um, I have to confess that I didn't really think about how automatically I use Google until
[8142.30 --> 8144.86]  I switched over to graph.
[8144.86 --> 8145.18]  Oh yeah.
[8145.20 --> 8145.80]  I skipped one.
[8145.86 --> 8146.54]  So, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[8146.60 --> 8148.14]  I meant I went web three, not web four.
[8148.22 --> 8148.52]  My bad.
[8148.52 --> 8148.80]  Thanks.
[8149.70 --> 8153.46]  Um, it defaults to duck, duck, go, and I have yet to have it be a problem yet.
[8153.48 --> 8154.50]  I haven't fully switched over.
[8154.54 --> 8155.94]  I haven't put my SIM in this phone yet.
[8156.46 --> 8158.44]  Um, it's, it's a bit of a trip, man.
[8159.00 --> 8165.76]  The default app store has, wait, what are you running?
[8165.84 --> 8165.96]  Sorry.
[8166.04 --> 8166.52]  Is that graphene?
[8166.52 --> 8167.16]  This many apps, graphene.
[8167.66 --> 8168.76]  I'm going to do it for a month.
[8169.44 --> 8172.26]  Uh, I had someone in chat earlier asking me about the fold seven.
[8172.38 --> 8173.74]  That's next in my queue.
[8173.82 --> 8175.12]  I haven't done a phone in a while.
[8175.20 --> 8177.34]  Now I've got two dumped on me at right at the same time.
[8177.34 --> 8180.86]  I might do the fold seven first just because it's a little, this is a little less time
[8180.86 --> 8184.60]  sensitive, but I'm, I'm very intrigued by it so far.
[8184.72 --> 8188.14]  There's, you have to install Android auto.
[8188.80 --> 8193.94]  You can install the Google play store and it runs in like a sandboxed way.
[8194.10 --> 8194.48]  Yeah.
[8194.76 --> 8198.28]  So that it like controls what it can see, but it doesn't even come with it by default.
[8198.38 --> 8201.92]  It's, um, it, I've been very interested in setting up graphene.
[8201.98 --> 8205.46]  The main thing that I've been staying away from is, and I'd be interested in if you can
[8205.46 --> 8209.34]  get an answer to this being an actual user, because I don't know anyone directly that
[8209.34 --> 8210.52]  actually uses it day to day.
[8210.86 --> 8215.06]  Um, but can you get any form of actual call screening?
[8216.02 --> 8218.90]  Um, cause I don't think so.
[8218.98 --> 8223.74]  And I've been wondering if there was some, cause call screening right now, as far as my
[8223.74 --> 8227.02]  understanding goes for Google is processed on their servers.
[8227.02 --> 8231.26]  So I was, I was wondering like the thing that terrifies me is how much this might cost.
[8231.62 --> 8235.82]  Um, but I was kind of thinking it could be interesting to try to set up like a, an open
[8235.82 --> 8240.26]  source bounty for a locally processed call screening app.
[8240.78 --> 8242.90]  Um, that's interesting.
[8242.90 --> 8244.56]  I think that would be really cool.
[8244.64 --> 8248.70]  That is something that like, if it was an app that existed and it was a paid app, I would
[8248.70 --> 8250.06]  buy it a hundred percent.
[8250.44 --> 8252.14]  Um, and I would switch over to graphene.
[8252.14 --> 8256.34]  But the, the thing that has been keeping me off of graphene is specifically just call
[8256.34 --> 8257.34]  screening, not being a thing.
[8257.66 --> 8261.52]  There's not just because of like my number having leaked a couple of times and stuff,
[8261.64 --> 8267.92]  but just, there are so many spam calls these days that it would like actually be a significant
[8267.92 --> 8270.84]  waste of my time to answer the phone every time I get called.
[8271.46 --> 8273.80]  Um, yeah.
[8275.16 --> 8275.60]  Okay.
[8275.70 --> 8276.70]  I added that to my notes.
[8276.70 --> 8284.18]  Having a pixel dialer that, that processes in Google's cloud is, is at least partially
[8284.18 --> 8285.94]  defeating the point of having graphene.
[8285.94 --> 8287.48]  And someone's like, oh, you can just download that.
[8287.48 --> 8293.88]  I think that's going to be one of my big conclusions, honestly, from this video is that, you know,
[8294.48 --> 8298.64]  I didn't find, I can already tell, I have hardly even set the thing up yet.
[8298.64 --> 8300.16]  You can say I have almost nothing installed in it.
[8300.58 --> 8304.44]  And the second I opened it up, I was like, well, I want Google, I want the Google play store.
[8304.44 --> 8310.28]  And I went, the conclusion is going to be, wow, using this is basically the same because
[8310.28 --> 8311.92]  I'm completely using it wrong.
[8312.14 --> 8314.42]  I, I, I, so to spoil the video a little bit.
[8315.02 --> 8320.88]  I, I, I think you should try to go out of your, you know, your, your box a little bit.
[8320.88 --> 8323.98]  Like what if you, it's tough because I have a lot of work.
[8323.98 --> 8324.68]  Map stop me.
[8325.06 --> 8327.50]  It's tough because I have a lot of work to do that.
[8327.54 --> 8329.62]  I just like need to do my work on.
[8329.62 --> 8331.50]  Should someone else do this with you then though?
[8331.50 --> 8335.44]  Cause like, I think that's not the graphene experience.
[8336.24 --> 8339.52]  Um, no, no, it's not.
[8339.58 --> 8344.58]  Cause there are like, there are alternative mapping solutions, which are like local localized
[8344.58 --> 8346.26]  maps and like all this other stuff.
[8346.30 --> 8346.52]  Yeah.
[8346.52 --> 8351.68]  There's one that's like right in, in their app store or in the, uh, the other app store
[8351.68 --> 8352.02]  that they have.
[8352.06 --> 8353.00]  It's like local maps.
[8353.00 --> 8358.64]  Um, but with that said, own a hikeage in a float plane chat says, I mean, look at the
[8358.64 --> 8362.26]  permissions list for Google play services and then have the satisfaction of being able to
[8362.26 --> 8363.30]  deny almost all of them.
[8363.38 --> 8369.38]  Like that's something sometimes cause like Android actually has a lot of really great
[8369.38 --> 8370.06]  privacy features.
[8370.26 --> 8371.36]  That doesn't defeat the purpose then.
[8371.42 --> 8373.84]  It's just that they don't, they don't guide you to use them.
[8373.84 --> 8378.28]  Like that's something that I think, um, that, that from my last round on iPhone that I came
[8378.28 --> 8384.78]  away really positive about was that, um, while honestly the iPhone doesn't actually have a
[8384.78 --> 8390.34]  lot of privacy stuff that Android doesn't have, what they do is they like put it in your face.
[8390.38 --> 8393.02]  They're like, Hey, this is happening.
[8393.14 --> 8394.80]  Did you, did you want, did you want this to happen?
[8394.80 --> 8395.32]  Right.
[8395.36 --> 8399.24]  Like they actually really make a point of prompting you to think about it.
[8399.24 --> 8402.92]  Whereas Google doesn't not to the same degree.
[8403.76 --> 8409.24]  Um, and so if, if it's as simple as, you know, making me think about it a little bit more,
[8409.28 --> 8413.96]  maybe graphene OS does have a point, even for someone like me, who isn't going to stop using
[8413.96 --> 8419.02]  Otter for meeting transcription and isn't going to stop using teams and isn't going to stop
[8419.02 --> 8424.60]  logging into my corporate G suite account, you know, as system wide as I possibly can.
[8424.60 --> 8426.24]  So that I have a more seamless experience, right?
[8426.26 --> 8430.12]  Like I'm going to do all those things, but Hey, at least it's not any worse than it has
[8430.12 --> 8431.28]  to be.
[8436.96 --> 8437.72]  Current years.
[8441.64 --> 8444.26]  What a statement about technology, right?
[8444.26 --> 8452.22]  I'm trying this new thing because at least it doesn't have to be any worse than it has
[8452.22 --> 8452.64]  to be.
[8454.60 --> 8458.22]  Oh, that blows.
[8460.30 --> 8461.08]  All right.
[8461.66 --> 8462.42]  All right.
[8462.50 --> 8465.96]  Our next topic is Linus wants to talk about this Reddit post.
[8466.60 --> 8467.76]  Is this normal?
[8468.08 --> 8471.98]  If you're playing console, some games will be discontinued on older platforms.
[8472.98 --> 8475.46]  No, but it will be.
[8475.46 --> 8478.48]  This was posted by Genshin Impact.
[8478.48 --> 8479.48]  Genshin Impact.
[8479.48 --> 8483.58]  Notice on the removal and discontinuation of updates for Genshin Impact on PS4.
[8483.58 --> 8484.86]  Hashtag Genshin Impact.
[8484.86 --> 8489.72]  Dear Traveler, thank you for your continued support and love for Genshin Impact on PS4.
[8490.14 --> 8494.74]  Due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size, we will be
[8494.74 --> 8499.48]  discontinuing support and updates for Genshin Impact on PS4 in future versions.
[8500.02 --> 8504.24]  Genshin Impact on PS5 will continue to operate normally and is not affected by the removal and
[8504.24 --> 8505.78]  update discontinuation on PS4.
[8505.78 --> 8511.74]  Traveler will still be able to enjoy the latest content updates on PS5 and other supported
[8511.74 --> 8512.84]  platforms.
[8512.84 --> 8518.18]  The Reddit user says, this is my first time encountering a game being discontinued as
[8518.18 --> 8519.26]  I don't use consoles.
[8519.68 --> 8523.80]  Should consumers who play on consoles be concerned about this?
[8524.12 --> 8526.32]  Games get discontinued on PC all the time.
[8526.46 --> 8527.24]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8527.36 --> 8533.94]  But my point is that this is a free to play game that just like stops working.
[8534.52 --> 8541.58]  This whole, it's, we are finally reaching the end game for some people of games as a service
[8541.58 --> 8545.06]  where they're going, well, hold on a second.
[8545.74 --> 8551.82]  But, but, but this is a game that I, that I always played on this and I, well, I still
[8551.82 --> 8553.90]  want to, I still want to play it on it.
[8554.20 --> 8556.16]  Well, what happened to the game that I played?
[8557.26 --> 8564.42]  This is what we've been talking about like this whole time where as soon as the control
[8564.42 --> 8566.64]  over the game, in this case, it's a free to play.
[8566.76 --> 8568.16]  So I'm not even mad.
[8568.28 --> 8570.46]  Like, yeah, they can do whatever they want to do with it.
[8570.46 --> 8573.68]  At the end of the day, it's up to them to optimize the size.
[8574.00 --> 8577.78]  Well, I mean, there's people that have spent a lot of money on this free to play game.
[8577.80 --> 8578.36]  This is true.
[8578.68 --> 8579.74]  No, this is very true.
[8581.16 --> 8581.78]  And now I guess.
[8581.78 --> 8582.92]  Free to play, but extremely monetized.
[8582.92 --> 8587.88]  Now I guess you better spend another 500 bucks on a PlayStation 5 or some other piece
[8587.88 --> 8589.14]  of hardware that'll run this game.
[8590.16 --> 8594.42]  And this is, this is what we warned you about.
[8594.42 --> 8597.34]  Is that, is that a crazy part of this?
[8597.42 --> 8603.14]  Like if you're, if you're a free to play platform, is this an easy way to get rid of the users
[8603.14 --> 8604.02]  that you don't want?
[8605.00 --> 8609.02]  Oh, just like the, the, the pores who aren't spending enough money on your game.
[8610.66 --> 8611.56]  Oh, wow.
[8611.68 --> 8616.68]  Because if they have enough money to buy those big packs, they, I'm assuming they sell packs.
[8616.68 --> 8617.98]  I think that's the thing these days.
[8618.52 --> 8621.38]  They probably have enough money to buy a new PlayStation.
[8625.46 --> 8626.60]  Man, this is brutal.
[8627.44 --> 8629.38]  I mean, to be clear, I'm not, sorry.
[8629.42 --> 8631.30]  I'm not, I'm not trying to like gloat or anything.
[8631.30 --> 8632.56]  I'm not happy about this.
[8632.56 --> 8637.94]  It's just like, this is, this is exactly what we've been talking about where you, you put
[8637.94 --> 8646.00]  the power in the game publisher's hands for when and how they want to support the game.
[8646.00 --> 8650.42]  And they decide, Hey, we're, you know what?
[8650.44 --> 8653.04]  We're just gonna, we're just gonna take our ball and go home.
[8653.88 --> 8654.42]  That's it.
[8654.48 --> 8655.62]  You're completely at their mercy.
[8655.74 --> 8656.98]  You don't play that game anymore.
[8657.18 --> 8663.66]  I, um, I gotta say, it's one of the reasons that I have a really hard time investing myself
[8663.66 --> 8667.50]  in any way, in any kind of live service gaming experience.
[8670.86 --> 8671.26]  Yeah.
[8671.26 --> 8676.26]  At the end of the day, next time I log in, it'll be different.
[8677.22 --> 8681.68]  And if I really liked it the way that it was, I feel like a lot of the toxicity that
[8681.68 --> 8686.86]  we see in these communities where they kind of anything, something gets buffed, half the
[8686.86 --> 8687.56]  community is mad.
[8687.70 --> 8690.04]  Something gets nerfed, half the community is mad.
[8690.10 --> 8691.74]  It's like, yeah.
[8691.74 --> 8691.82]  Yeah.
[8692.54 --> 8694.18]  One of the problems is just be happy.
[8694.30 --> 8695.74]  They didn't rip it out of your hands entirely.
[8695.74 --> 8698.52]  I guess is, is the only consolation I can offer.
[8699.92 --> 8704.80]  One of the problems is even single player games are getting post launch balance changes
[8704.80 --> 8711.84]  these days, which I just don't get, but is absolutely a thing.
[8711.84 --> 8716.14]  Like nothing is really safe from the developers continuing to metal.
[8716.14 --> 8720.64]  Uh, regitis says, does wow still have the same hardware requirements as when it was released
[8720.64 --> 8721.26]  20 years ago?
[8721.38 --> 8722.12]  Absolutely not.
[8722.58 --> 8728.12]  And, um, this may surprise you, but I have never subscribed to wow.
[8730.24 --> 8738.52]  But you could play a privateered pirate server of the original wow.
[8738.52 --> 8743.52]  Um, that does have the same hardware requirements with Genshin.
[8743.60 --> 8745.74]  You're just kind of like, let's go PC gaming.
[8745.82 --> 8746.74]  You're just kind of burned, I guess.
[8746.74 --> 8748.44]  There are privateer servers for Genshin as well.
[8748.60 --> 8750.38]  Someone mentioned it in float plane chat.
[8750.48 --> 8751.44]  I had no idea.
[8752.18 --> 8752.46]  Okay.
[8752.48 --> 8753.18]  That's pretty cool.
[8754.26 --> 8755.68]  Um, yeah.
[8755.76 --> 8756.88]  Elijah makes a good point.
[8756.92 --> 8758.12]  I mean, the game runs on a phone.
[8758.12 --> 8761.92]  So from his point of view, this seems like a hundred percent an excuse to get rid of the
[8761.92 --> 8762.18]  pores.
[8765.08 --> 8768.10]  That's like, it's such a cynical take, but I wish I could.
[8768.52 --> 8769.88]  I wish I could refute it.
[8771.68 --> 8776.94]  But are they really putting that much server load on just firing up the game on their PlayStation
[8776.94 --> 8777.98]  and playing Genshin Impact?
[8778.20 --> 8780.22]  Like I am, it's rendered locally.
[8780.38 --> 8781.28]  Like what's the load?
[8782.06 --> 8783.34]  They mentioned performance.
[8783.34 --> 8788.96]  And I wonder if it's like, you know, they want to release some new zone and it's going
[8788.96 --> 8791.24]  to just not function or something.
[8791.36 --> 8791.90]  I have no idea.
[8792.04 --> 8794.44]  FogelBR said, this isn't taking your ball and going home.
[8794.52 --> 8796.66]  This is popping the player's ball and walking away.
[8796.76 --> 8796.96]  Yeah.
[8797.52 --> 8797.92]  Yeah.
[8797.96 --> 8798.36]  I get it.
[8799.12 --> 8805.94]  I still think I, I, I wouldn't be surprised if there was at least an undertone of we're
[8805.94 --> 8807.40]  not worried about those users though.
[8807.92 --> 8808.32]  Seriously.
[8809.16 --> 8809.60]  Yeah.
[8809.70 --> 8813.42]  Because if you're a free to play game and you have users that never pay for microtransactions,
[8813.54 --> 8815.04]  those users cost you money.
[8815.60 --> 8816.52]  I guess that's true.
[8816.56 --> 8818.58]  It doesn't matter if they're only costing you a little bit.
[8818.76 --> 8819.76]  They're costing you money.
[8820.38 --> 8821.28]  They're costing you money.
[8821.28 --> 8825.70]  There is an aspect to it where they are fodder for your paid users.
[8825.70 --> 8831.12]  They are the minions that your paid users get to cleave through and look down on.
[8831.12 --> 8833.06]  So you want at least some of them.
[8833.06 --> 8836.44]  But you probably don't need that many, you know?
[8839.94 --> 8840.30]  Yeah.
[8840.30 --> 8844.16]  Man, that's adding another layer of cynicism to it.
[8844.72 --> 8847.54]  Like having the poorest just be fodder for the pay to wins.
[8847.54 --> 8851.30]  So having them be part of your, part of your balanced ecosystem.
[8851.64 --> 8853.88]  That's, that's, dude, that's crazy.
[8854.14 --> 8855.02]  That's crazy.
[8855.22 --> 8856.80]  No, I'm, I'm certain that's the thing.
[8856.92 --> 8859.90]  I used to think about this and I would talk about it sometimes with Tarkov too.
[8859.90 --> 8862.04]  Because Tarkov had a skill system.
[8862.14 --> 8866.70]  It was really weird that a, a first person shooter game has skill system.
[8866.88 --> 8871.46]  And the skill system took forever to level up.
[8871.62 --> 8875.04]  Like for, for reference, like, you know, I play that game a ton.
[8875.14 --> 8877.94]  I don't think I ever actually maxed out a skill.
[8878.46 --> 8878.98]  Right.
[8879.08 --> 8880.52]  Because they don't want you to.
[8882.00 --> 8886.20]  Unless you're like a streamer bro.
[8886.20 --> 8886.44]  Yeah.
[8886.82 --> 8889.26]  And you play this game for your living.
[8889.50 --> 8891.90]  And also you are the, the, the advertisement.
[8892.22 --> 8895.28]  So if you have skills, once you get a skill to max level in Tarkov,
[8895.54 --> 8901.98]  not only is it strong, but you unlock unique perks that are like really strong.
[8903.08 --> 8903.56]  Okay.
[8903.80 --> 8908.38]  And it, it, it, it gives you a definite actual advantage in the game.
[8908.38 --> 8911.24]  So if all your streamer bros have an advantage in the game.
[8911.44 --> 8911.70]  Yeah.
[8912.52 --> 8914.36]  And also play all the time.
[8914.46 --> 8915.18]  So they're really good.
[8915.18 --> 8919.14]  Then they make the game look like way cooler and way awesomer.
[8919.34 --> 8921.86]  And you're like, Oh, I want to go, you know,
[8922.18 --> 8924.92]  kill all these dudes and get all their gear and be better than everyone as well.
[8925.06 --> 8927.18]  And then you go play and you just get wrecked.
[8927.22 --> 8929.96]  Cause now you are the cannon fodder for the streamer bros.
[8930.08 --> 8931.52]  It's a, it's an interesting concept.
[8931.62 --> 8936.08]  There's, there's so much incentive right now to make your game good for streamers.
[8936.62 --> 8940.18]  Um, I think this is so gross.
[8940.18 --> 8949.06]  PUBG had a really, really, really, really strong natural cycle of intense focus gameplay.
[8949.06 --> 8957.16]  So it was like intense focus looting round with a little bit of a lull after that, where you're probably just running or moving or whatever.
[8957.16 --> 8962.16]  And you can, you can talk to chat, answer some, uh, some merch messages, message things.
[8962.22 --> 8962.50]  Thanks.
[8962.54 --> 8963.18]  Some people, whatever.
[8963.18 --> 8974.84]  And then get into the late game fight and then die and then get into the lobby where you can sit back and fully relax and chat with your, talk with your chat for a while and respond to more subscription stuff.
[8974.92 --> 8976.36]  Then you get into another game and it keeps cycling.
[8976.36 --> 8984.76]  Um, cause if you play a game like, um, I don't know, this is a topical game right now, Battlefield.
[8985.10 --> 8996.74]  Battlefield might not be as strong of a streaming game cause it doesn't necessarily have the break cycle that something like a, um, Apex Legends or a, um, PUBG or whatever else might have.
[8996.86 --> 9000.26]  So there's these like, is it, is it a good game for streamers?
[9000.26 --> 9010.58]  Because if it is a good game for streamers, whether or not that translates to the users individually does mean that you have like the best possible advertising engine for games on your side, which means you'll probably win regardless.
[9012.12 --> 9017.86]  Like we, we see this with Among Us, I think is another good example of Among Us is like an incredibly good streaming game.
[9018.42 --> 9021.48]  Um, Among Us didn't take off for a really long time.
[9021.48 --> 9028.80]  Among Us was not super talked about and then it took off with streamers, which made it take off in sales.
[9028.80 --> 9030.40]  And now it's like a cultural phenomenon.
[9030.82 --> 9036.80]  And then a bunch of games have been made in the spirit of Among Us, whether or not they're actually like Among Us directly or not.
[9036.86 --> 9038.80]  They've been made with that, with that same type of spirit.
[9039.14 --> 9041.08]  And we saw the exact same thing happen with PUBG.
[9041.28 --> 9052.68]  The strongest marketing engine in the world is going to be able to dictate the type of games that are made, um, and the ways that they're made and the benefits that certain players may or may not have.
[9056.10 --> 9057.08]  It's a wild world.
[9057.88 --> 9058.24]  Ah.
[9058.80 --> 9059.88]  My laptop's doing that thing again.
[9059.94 --> 9060.60]  So give me a sec.
[9061.52 --> 9061.96]  Okay.
[9066.96 --> 9067.56]  There we go.
[9067.78 --> 9068.68]  Everything's working again.
[9069.38 --> 9070.34]  Way to go, Lenovo.
[9070.72 --> 9076.08]  I love that Among Us is just like, was it?
[9076.20 --> 9076.94]  It was you.
[9077.06 --> 9079.12]  It was you I was talking to about this.
[9079.12 --> 9087.88]  When you saw Adam's title for the YouTube profanity relaxation thing, you were like, oh, it's like the Blink song.
[9087.96 --> 9092.02]  And I was like, no, the origin of that is actually George Carlin's bit.
[9092.08 --> 9093.58]  The seven words you cannot say.
[9093.58 --> 9100.22]  It's been very interesting to watch my kids think that Among Us is like sort of the origin of.
[9100.42 --> 9104.48]  It's like, bro, we used to play Among Us in IRL.
[9104.48 --> 9105.70]  It was called Mafia.
[9105.70 --> 9105.82]  Yeah.
[9105.82 --> 9109.40]  You know, but didn't wasn't Mafia.
[9109.62 --> 9111.24]  I think it's been off of something else.
[9111.24 --> 9114.34]  I think the original might be Secret Hitler or Werewolf.
[9114.46 --> 9115.52]  There's a lot of different variants.
[9115.62 --> 9123.96]  It's like card games where there's a lot of variants of it, which can be, you know, which can be frustrating, but can also be really cool.
[9123.96 --> 9131.08]  Like I played a card game that my grandmother called Hand and Foot, which I've never been able to figure out what it was.
[9131.26 --> 9134.12]  You had like two sets of cards.
[9134.20 --> 9137.00]  That's all I remember because I was like seven or eight or something.
[9138.06 --> 9141.74]  And so it's really cool that we used to have kind of house rules for things.
[9142.00 --> 9145.16]  And I think that's something that's kind of missing now that everyone just plays Among Us.
[9146.34 --> 9149.30]  But also you can like tweak the rule set or, you know, whatever.
[9149.80 --> 9151.20]  I just might be mods for Among Us.
[9151.20 --> 9154.68]  Well, you can even just you can even just tweak the rule set.
[9154.96 --> 9155.28]  Wait.
[9155.84 --> 9158.12]  D-Doc says, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9158.18 --> 9159.80]  You guys actually know this game?
[9161.08 --> 9161.62]  Hold on.
[9161.68 --> 9163.22]  People actually know Hand and Foot.
[9163.30 --> 9163.54]  Okay.
[9163.60 --> 9164.28]  I need someone.
[9164.68 --> 9165.00]  Okay.
[9165.06 --> 9166.74]  What is it actually called?
[9167.74 --> 9172.14]  Because I've tried to look it up and I've never been able to find the game that I played.
[9173.06 --> 9174.58]  My wife knows that game.
[9175.10 --> 9175.96]  Hold on a second.
[9175.96 --> 9178.94]  Did my Google food just suck?
[9178.94 --> 9182.02]  Hand and Foot is a card game, a variation of Canasta.
[9182.84 --> 9183.24]  Canasta.
[9184.08 --> 9184.44]  Oh.
[9185.78 --> 9188.00]  Hey, thanks, AI Summary.
[9190.06 --> 9190.46]  Yep.
[9191.26 --> 9191.62]  Canasta.
[9193.20 --> 9193.60]  No.
[9195.30 --> 9196.38]  How to play Hand and Foot.
[9196.46 --> 9196.66]  Okay.
[9196.76 --> 9198.70]  Apparently I just sucked at looking this up before.
[9198.92 --> 9202.72]  I did look it up years and years ago because I was like, oh, I'd love to play that game that
[9202.72 --> 9203.58]  I played when I was a kid.
[9203.66 --> 9205.94]  I couldn't find any information on it.
[9205.94 --> 9208.88]  Some people are saying it's a version of Rummy.
[9208.96 --> 9210.34]  No, it's a variation of Canasta.
[9210.54 --> 9210.80]  Okay.
[9211.42 --> 9216.88]  I'm going to have to figure out this Canasta thing.
[9217.88 --> 9218.72]  Oh, here's...
[9218.72 --> 9219.06]  Okay.
[9219.14 --> 9226.84]  Here's probably a source that I could maybe trust since they have been trusted since 1885.
[9226.84 --> 9227.56]  You know.
[9228.82 --> 9229.22]  Wait.
[9230.14 --> 9231.98]  They don't even make bicycles.
[9234.80 --> 9235.20]  Liars.
[9236.74 --> 9237.36]  Oh, boy.
[9237.40 --> 9239.06]  This is why they promote this game, though.
[9241.72 --> 9242.48]  Oh, wow.
[9242.72 --> 9242.96]  Yep.
[9243.00 --> 9243.88]  That's how they get you.
[9244.40 --> 9245.30]  That's how they get you.
[9245.36 --> 9246.18]  Five to six decks of cards.
[9246.26 --> 9246.44]  Okay.
[9246.76 --> 9247.12]  All right.
[9247.20 --> 9252.50]  I'm officially adding play Hand and Foot to my list of things to do with the kids.
[9252.50 --> 9256.46]  Feel free to pick a topic in the meantime.
[9257.92 --> 9258.40]  Okay.
[9261.28 --> 9261.72]  Whoa.
[9261.84 --> 9262.86]  What the heck just happened?
[9263.26 --> 9263.86]  There we go.
[9265.46 --> 9265.90]  PSA.
[9266.04 --> 9270.44]  Instagram added maps and your location is on by default.
[9271.44 --> 9271.88]  Perfect.
[9272.40 --> 9278.18]  Yesterday, Instagram updated to have a map feature where you can see events and other stories
[9278.18 --> 9279.38]  from around the world.
[9279.38 --> 9282.00]  The problem is this is on by default.
[9282.12 --> 9287.64]  So if you happen to post a story from your house, it lets all your followers know your
[9287.64 --> 9288.68]  exact location.
[9289.30 --> 9290.58]  Holy crap.
[9290.90 --> 9292.46]  That is the dumbest thing.
[9293.42 --> 9294.46]  So turn the setting off.
[9295.10 --> 9300.96]  Either deny Instagram having location access in your phone settings or in app, navigate to
[9300.96 --> 9306.04]  story, live and location and turn location sharing to no one.
[9306.04 --> 9314.10]  Elijah said, I saw this story since I was following someone who had over 4 million followers and
[9314.10 --> 9318.52]  people started sending her screenshots of her house on Google because she posted a story
[9318.52 --> 9319.18]  of her cat.
[9320.68 --> 9321.20]  Wow.
[9322.20 --> 9325.10]  Oh my God.
[9327.60 --> 9329.16]  All right.
[9329.24 --> 9331.36]  Well, I need to log into my Insta real quick.
[9331.36 --> 9335.16]  At least I don't post on Instagram.
[9335.56 --> 9335.92]  Yeah, me neither.
[9336.10 --> 9338.46]  But what if I accidentally did at some point?
[9339.24 --> 9341.24]  Yeah, I'm going to change this right now.
[9341.42 --> 9342.12]  This is this.
[9343.18 --> 9345.54]  I hope there's some way they can get sued for this.
[9346.42 --> 9347.28]  I doubt it.
[9347.32 --> 9349.58]  They should be able to get sued for doxing people for that.
[9350.60 --> 9351.00]  Default.
[9352.70 --> 9356.54]  Default enabled needs to be something that is like cared about more.
[9356.54 --> 9357.10]  Okay.
[9357.20 --> 9357.76]  So what do we do?
[9357.86 --> 9360.40]  We go to in app.
[9360.50 --> 9363.46]  We navigate to story, live and location.
[9363.68 --> 9364.30]  Oh my God.
[9364.36 --> 9367.00]  How are there this many settings in the Instagram app?
[9367.34 --> 9368.46]  Like, oh.
[9370.16 --> 9371.28]  Also for meta.
[9371.86 --> 9372.60]  I don't care.
[9373.14 --> 9375.12]  I'd never use this app.
[9375.24 --> 9379.02]  I really don't know just about anything about it.
[9379.52 --> 9382.26]  I already had location settings off.
[9382.38 --> 9383.76]  So it didn't work for me anyways.
[9384.22 --> 9385.68]  Who can see your content?
[9385.68 --> 9386.68]  How you account?
[9386.82 --> 9387.04]  Is it?
[9387.08 --> 9388.06]  Oh, is it account center?
[9389.18 --> 9390.56]  Sharing across profiles.
[9390.68 --> 9391.26]  Oh my God.
[9391.30 --> 9392.18]  Account settings.
[9393.44 --> 9395.58]  Preferences, subscriptions, personal details.
[9395.98 --> 9396.96]  I can't even find.
[9397.04 --> 9397.42]  Oh, story.
[9397.50 --> 9398.26]  Story live and location.
[9398.36 --> 9398.58]  Here we go.
[9398.60 --> 9398.86]  Here we go.
[9398.88 --> 9399.20]  Here we go.
[9399.46 --> 9399.68]  Okay.
[9399.76 --> 9400.66]  Location sharing.
[9401.38 --> 9401.80]  Next.
[9402.58 --> 9403.32]  No one.
[9403.52 --> 9403.74]  Cool.
[9403.88 --> 9404.12]  Done.
[9405.28 --> 9406.10]  All right.
[9406.20 --> 9407.04]  Not sharing location.
[9407.72 --> 9408.04]  Nice.
[9408.62 --> 9409.18]  Let's go.
[9409.52 --> 9409.76]  Whoa.
[9409.86 --> 9410.12]  Okay.
[9410.42 --> 9411.10]  You can see.
[9411.20 --> 9411.38]  Okay.
[9411.38 --> 9412.24]  This is the dumb.
[9412.36 --> 9412.76]  Okay.
[9413.76 --> 9414.20]  Whoa.
[9414.36 --> 9415.54]  I need to message some people.
[9415.68 --> 9420.76]  Um, quite a few people actually.
[9421.10 --> 9423.50]  Let's go to an area where I won't have to.
[9424.50 --> 9425.58]  What were you saying earlier?
[9425.58 --> 9425.84]  Okay.
[9425.84 --> 9427.50]  So these are just country accounts.
[9427.66 --> 9428.96]  So I can show this.
[9429.06 --> 9429.34]  Yeah.
[9429.34 --> 9433.34]  Um, but it shows exactly where they were posting from.
[9433.60 --> 9433.94]  Wow.
[9434.30 --> 9437.24]  And it's a live map that you can like scroll around on.
[9437.28 --> 9438.46]  I'm not going to move that much.
[9439.16 --> 9445.32]  Because I found people that I know personally and I know where they live and I'm looking on
[9445.32 --> 9447.36]  the map and that's where their house is.
[9447.36 --> 9449.00]  And there's more than one of them.
[9449.00 --> 9452.70]  Can you guys believe Luke just doxed an entire country?
[9453.32 --> 9454.54]  Live on the WAN show?
[9455.28 --> 9456.22]  Actual crime.
[9457.00 --> 9457.98]  Dude, this is crazy.
[9457.98 --> 9462.32]  I didn't zoom in far enough, but I might have doxed who is running those countries' accounts.
[9462.32 --> 9464.86]  Is someone going to have to die?
[9465.36 --> 9468.16]  Like for meta to take this stuff seriously?
[9468.36 --> 9468.90]  Will they even?
[9470.04 --> 9472.94]  Like this is actually, this is insane.
[9472.94 --> 9476.16]  Holy crap.
[9476.24 --> 9479.66]  I didn't think you, it would literally just give you a map that you can scroll around
[9479.66 --> 9482.82]  and see everyone that you're following actively with their most recent stories.
[9482.82 --> 9484.50]  Like that is wild.
[9485.56 --> 9488.84]  Elijah said, and it was a snap maps thing from like 10 years ago.
[9489.42 --> 9491.08]  This is so dumb.
[9492.18 --> 9495.18]  This is actually just very brain dead.
[9495.18 --> 9502.22]  I, yeah, like there's a, there's a.
[9502.94 --> 9508.56]  There's one that I follow and I don't know this person, but the snap map location is like
[9508.56 --> 9511.72]  in suburbia in kind of the middle of nowhere.
[9512.00 --> 9513.68]  So it's probably their house.
[9513.78 --> 9514.92]  That's really bad.
[9517.80 --> 9518.40]  Whoa.
[9520.78 --> 9526.08]  In other news, Microsoft thinks we're going to throw away our keyboards by the year 2030.
[9526.90 --> 9532.66]  Microsoft corporate VP of OS security, David Dwizzle Yeston made some bold claims
[9532.66 --> 9538.36]  in a video posted on the windows YouTube channel about Microsoft's vision of computing in 2030.
[9539.34 --> 9539.82]  TLDR.
[9540.70 --> 9541.98]  The future is AI.
[9542.94 --> 9547.98]  Among numerous ideas about how AI agents will improve OS security and computing in general
[9547.98 --> 9548.86]  in the next five years.
[9549.28 --> 9555.60]  Weston claimed that the world of mousing around and typing will feel as alien as it does to
[9555.60 --> 9562.14]  Gen Z to use MS DOS and said that we will have unlimited compute in the form of quantum.
[9563.52 --> 9567.18]  YouTube viewers commenting on the video tend to take issue with Dwizzle's predictions.
[9567.92 --> 9575.08]  Herman Booster 8944 asks, why is the VP of OS security suggesting such unsecure modes of interaction?
[9575.08 --> 9582.16]  While Susukatashi points out, you've been trying to migrate control panel to the settings app for 13 years.
[9582.16 --> 9593.22]  This whole interview was, yeah, it was kind of rough, honestly.
[9594.38 --> 9604.56]  But yeah, I don't really know how to deal with people who seem to be under the impression that,
[9604.68 --> 9608.56]  with people who keep trying to reinvent the mousing keyboard.
[9608.56 --> 9617.74]  There isn't a faster, more precise way, and if there was, we would have thought of it,
[9618.16 --> 9621.88]  to point at something and interact with it.
[9624.00 --> 9634.08]  Also, this may be surprising to Mr. Dwizzle Yeston, but many people still use the command line for many things.
[9634.08 --> 9641.32]  Some of them on a daily or even hourly or minutely basis.
[9641.46 --> 9647.78]  It can be an incredibly convenient and fast way of interacting with a PC,
[9647.94 --> 9650.18]  depending on what exactly it is that you're trying to do.
[9650.76 --> 9653.12]  Photo editing? Probably not so much.
[9656.00 --> 9658.06]  Administering a server? Definitely.
[9658.06 --> 9665.10]  Hamnetics says, IP config daily.
[9665.82 --> 9668.78]  Yeah, I mean, even a lot more than that, though.
[9670.36 --> 9674.52]  Yeah, pkinetic says, I do command line stuff more now than I did 20 years ago.
[9674.66 --> 9674.84]  Yep.
[9676.80 --> 9680.06]  Aslan says, shout out FFmpeg, 100%.
[9680.06 --> 9682.36]  Luke, do you need help?
[9682.36 --> 9685.36]  There are some...
[9686.50 --> 9689.28]  I'm helping some people right now.
[9689.40 --> 9693.42]  There are some people that, like, you know, that actively docks their own houses.
[9694.86 --> 9695.10]  Oh.
[9696.12 --> 9697.36]  So I'm trying to...
[9697.88 --> 9698.20]  Cool.
[9698.34 --> 9699.36]  Not you, but...
[9700.00 --> 9700.30]  Right.
[9701.26 --> 9704.46]  Yeah, I don't have any Instagram users in my immediate family.
[9705.44 --> 9707.56]  But yes, I mean, you know what?
[9707.90 --> 9709.70]  You go ahead and do what you got to do.
[9709.70 --> 9716.40]  Digital Foundry has gone independent by buying their brand and video archive from IGN.
[9717.96 --> 9721.90]  After years of shared ownership, which passed from parent company to parent company,
[9722.04 --> 9724.30]  and David has a note here, Eurogamer's parent company,
[9724.76 --> 9729.54]  Gamers Network first bought 50% of Digital Foundry, but was then bought by ReadPop,
[9729.66 --> 9733.08]  and then IGN's parent company, Ziff Davis, bought Gamers Network from them.
[9733.44 --> 9737.94]  Ziff Davis has had back-to-back rounds of layoffs and offered the buyback to Leadbetter.
[9737.94 --> 9738.94]  Huh.
[9739.34 --> 9743.22]  Richard Leadbetter has bought back a majority share of Digital Foundry,
[9743.30 --> 9745.24]  the company he founded around 20 years ago,
[9745.44 --> 9749.14]  by adding 25% to the 50% ownership he already had.
[9749.42 --> 9754.60]  The final 25% will be held by investor Rupert Lohman, co-founder of Eurogamer.
[9755.34 --> 9757.52]  Although we don't know the exact cost of the buyback,
[9757.98 --> 9758.62]  Leadbetter said,
[9758.62 --> 9763.76]  I think this is pretty much easily the biggest thing I've ever bought, more than my house.
[9764.88 --> 9768.32]  Leadbetter also insists that Digital Foundry won't see major changes,
[9768.58 --> 9771.12]  or move to a primarily subscription-based model,
[9771.42 --> 9774.80]  and hopes that they can more easily pursue some of the passion projects
[9774.80 --> 9777.36]  that their parent companies have shied away from,
[9777.54 --> 9779.34]  like a retro games-focused podcast.
[9779.76 --> 9780.62]  That would be pretty cool.
[9780.62 --> 9784.54]  We're huge fans of the painstaking work that Digital Foundry does,
[9784.62 --> 9786.42]  so we're excited to see where they take the company,
[9786.76 --> 9789.20]  and we wish them nothing but success after success.
[9789.30 --> 9793.76]  So congrats, Richard, Alex, John, Oliver, and everyone on the team.
[9793.76 --> 9795.76]  Our discussion question here is,
[9796.00 --> 9801.70]  what freedoms has being an independent media source afforded LMG?
[9802.76 --> 9805.14]  Ooh, I mean, many.
[9805.14 --> 9810.24]  I think that without being privately held,
[9810.72 --> 9814.04]  not just privately held, but majority privately held,
[9814.54 --> 9819.40]  we would be a shadow of the company that we are today.
[9819.64 --> 9822.90]  We would not be able to do any of the kind of fun,
[9822.96 --> 9824.76]  outlandish projects that we do,
[9824.90 --> 9828.86]  buying fire trucks, moving into the old house for our April Fools.
[9828.86 --> 9829.92]  The fire truck would have never flown.
[9830.00 --> 9831.36]  There's absolutely no way.
[9831.36 --> 9831.84]  That would never happen.
[9831.94 --> 9832.76]  There's absolutely no way.
[9832.76 --> 9834.90]  Especially the last April Fools one,
[9834.90 --> 9836.50]  where you got that house.
[9837.64 --> 9838.40]  There's no way.
[9838.48 --> 9839.76]  There's absolutely no way.
[9839.98 --> 9842.00]  Bean counters won't allow that kind of thing.
[9842.52 --> 9846.50]  And as much as I love to kind of rib Yvonne on camera
[9846.50 --> 9848.78]  about her bean counter persona,
[9848.98 --> 9852.58]  she's a pretty fun-loving bean counter,
[9852.68 --> 9854.52]  and it really doesn't take that much convincing
[9854.52 --> 9860.24]  for her to kind of let me do whatever it is
[9860.24 --> 9863.14]  that I think is going to ultimately resonate with you,
[9863.14 --> 9866.56]  who I see as our guiding star, right?
[9868.12 --> 9873.50]  And help us kind of build that relationship in the longer term.
[9874.06 --> 9878.12]  There's all kinds of decisions with respect to like sponsored content
[9878.12 --> 9881.78]  or advertiser relationships that we've walked away from
[9881.78 --> 9888.80]  that I don't think a more bean-oriented ownership group would have allowed,
[9888.80 --> 9892.66]  or they certainly would have pushed us to try to make things work
[9892.66 --> 9894.12]  when we just look at it and we just go,
[9894.20 --> 9895.68]  yeah, this just doesn't really make sense.
[9897.50 --> 9899.96]  Like there's times that we could have done it,
[9900.08 --> 9902.60]  but it just, it would have sucked,
[9902.72 --> 9904.40]  and it would have felt forced,
[9904.72 --> 9907.32]  and you guys wouldn't have liked it,
[9907.32 --> 9909.00]  and it wouldn't have been good for the long term,
[9909.14 --> 9913.14]  but I just feel like more numbers-oriented people
[9913.14 --> 9916.26]  have a tendency to be
[9916.26 --> 9922.56]  not even not forward-thinking,
[9922.70 --> 9924.62]  but almost more retrospective.
[9925.08 --> 9926.46]  Like, you know, you'll look,
[9926.68 --> 9928.58]  they'll look back and go,
[9928.68 --> 9931.22]  well, that didn't, you know, blow us up back then,
[9931.22 --> 9932.44]  so it should be fine.
[9932.98 --> 9935.66]  And looking backward is such a,
[9936.10 --> 9938.16]  well, for me, it's such a,
[9938.16 --> 9943.42]  it's such a flawed perspective
[9943.42 --> 9946.06]  when you're trying to figure out the path forward,
[9946.18 --> 9947.80]  because just because the direction
[9947.80 --> 9949.60]  that you're marching in right now
[9949.60 --> 9951.48]  has been good up until this time
[9951.48 --> 9954.50]  doesn't mean that it is going to be good in the future,
[9954.50 --> 9956.20]  or even that it was ever good.
[9956.26 --> 9956.88]  It just means,
[9957.24 --> 9958.78]  it might just mean you got away with it,
[9959.16 --> 9959.82]  you know?
[9959.82 --> 9967.14]  And I am grateful every day
[9967.14 --> 9968.70]  that we never raised money.
[9969.78 --> 9972.94]  Every day that we do anything,
[9973.52 --> 9974.32]  I'm like, man,
[9974.46 --> 9976.42]  I am so glad
[9976.42 --> 9977.56]  that I'm not accountable
[9977.56 --> 9979.62]  to some bean counter owner
[9979.62 --> 9982.14]  that can tell me how to do my job,
[9982.20 --> 9983.46]  because at the end of the day,
[9983.52 --> 9985.30]  my job is to be me.
[9985.78 --> 9987.60]  And hopefully, you know,
[9987.60 --> 9988.82]  enough of you out there
[9988.82 --> 9990.56]  relate to that,
[9990.62 --> 9993.14]  that this whole thing doesn't collapse, right?
[9993.14 --> 9994.24]  Like, we are,
[9994.90 --> 9996.34]  it's pretty
[9996.34 --> 9999.60]  scary,
[10000.02 --> 10001.96]  and also humbling to think about
[10001.96 --> 10005.52]  that we are one of the longest standing,
[10005.52 --> 10007.24]  like, influencer
[10007.24 --> 10009.60]  organizations
[10009.60 --> 10011.80]  slash people.
[10011.80 --> 10015.88]  Like, I hail from a completely different era
[10015.88 --> 10018.28]  of online influencers
[10018.28 --> 10019.96]  before the word even existed.
[10020.90 --> 10021.80]  And yeah, you know,
[10021.92 --> 10023.30]  I'm not on...
[10023.30 --> 10024.30]  There's been many, actually.
[10024.46 --> 10025.52]  Multiple eras.
[10025.52 --> 10025.66]  Since it started.
[10026.12 --> 10027.94]  The rise and fall
[10027.94 --> 10028.92]  of many,
[10028.92 --> 10030.92]  many, many
[10030.92 --> 10032.76]  KOLs,
[10033.18 --> 10034.64]  key online influencers,
[10034.64 --> 10036.14]  that was the first term
[10036.14 --> 10037.64]  that had influencer in it
[10037.64 --> 10038.60]  that I remember
[10038.60 --> 10041.58]  from before that was just like a thing,
[10042.22 --> 10044.44]  have come and gone
[10044.44 --> 10045.70]  in the time that I've been around.
[10045.80 --> 10046.28]  And I am,
[10046.82 --> 10047.32]  you know,
[10047.36 --> 10048.30]  knock on wood here,
[10048.72 --> 10049.18]  you know,
[10049.22 --> 10050.58]  haven't reached the same heights
[10050.58 --> 10052.20]  as some of those,
[10052.24 --> 10053.12]  as some of those people,
[10053.24 --> 10053.52]  you know,
[10053.52 --> 10054.88]  what they say about the candle
[10054.88 --> 10056.84]  that burns twice as bright
[10056.84 --> 10058.04]  might burn half as long.
[10058.14 --> 10061.48]  So mine's been a slow burn
[10061.48 --> 10063.84]  in my weird little tech niche here.
[10063.92 --> 10066.14]  But I am acutely aware
[10066.14 --> 10068.36]  of the fact that
[10068.36 --> 10072.60]  what we do
[10072.60 --> 10079.30]  is an alchemical combination
[10079.30 --> 10082.48]  of luck and skill
[10082.48 --> 10084.46]  and the right people
[10084.46 --> 10085.72]  and,
[10085.72 --> 10088.34]  and grit
[10088.34 --> 10089.14]  and,
[10089.14 --> 10090.68]  and all of those things
[10090.68 --> 10091.92]  that have somehow managed
[10091.92 --> 10092.26]  to,
[10092.26 --> 10093.42]  to carry on for,
[10093.56 --> 10094.40]  I mean,
[10094.52 --> 10095.22]  17,
[10095.32 --> 10097.38]  I think coming on 18 years now
[10097.38 --> 10098.52]  since my first upload,
[10098.72 --> 10101.56]  which is literally my,
[10101.68 --> 10103.46]  my YouTube career is,
[10103.62 --> 10106.20]  is almost legally an adult now.
[10107.30 --> 10109.68]  It's just kind of mind blowing,
[10109.80 --> 10110.08]  you know?
[10110.08 --> 10114.20]  It is,
[10114.30 --> 10115.86]  it is kind of wild.
[10116.16 --> 10116.48]  It's,
[10116.54 --> 10117.28]  it's been interesting
[10117.28 --> 10119.22]  being in creator conversations,
[10119.22 --> 10121.04]  like mostly at OpenSauce,
[10121.44 --> 10123.84]  where,
[10123.84 --> 10130.78]  like you hear people talk about us,
[10130.78 --> 10131.66]  if you know what I mean.
[10132.88 --> 10133.62]  Like it's,
[10133.72 --> 10135.52]  there's very few people still around
[10135.52 --> 10137.78]  that know that,
[10137.78 --> 10140.00]  that we kind of like pioneered ads,
[10140.10 --> 10141.36]  which in a,
[10141.40 --> 10142.50]  in a pretty large way,
[10142.60 --> 10145.54]  directly or indirectly enabled a lot of creators
[10145.54 --> 10147.20]  to do this as a job.
[10147.20 --> 10148.12]  Um,
[10149.00 --> 10149.58]  there's.
[10149.90 --> 10150.90]  To be clear,
[10151.14 --> 10151.94]  I just want to make,
[10152.06 --> 10153.20]  I want to point a clarification.
[10153.20 --> 10156.96]  We weren't the first to do the like podcast style,
[10156.96 --> 10157.48]  like,
[10157.56 --> 10157.82]  you know,
[10157.96 --> 10160.24]  ad reads inside our videos,
[10160.24 --> 10164.22]  but we were one of the first to do it,
[10164.22 --> 10165.00]  um,
[10165.00 --> 10165.64]  with like the,
[10165.64 --> 10168.22]  the cutaway to essentially very similar
[10168.22 --> 10171.56]  to Google's own AdSense spots.
[10171.88 --> 10172.32]  Uh,
[10172.32 --> 10174.62]  we were one of the first to do sponsorship reads
[10174.62 --> 10176.56]  like that with the,
[10176.56 --> 10176.78]  you know,
[10176.80 --> 10177.74]  the link above the fold.
[10177.74 --> 10179.46]  And we used to use YouTube's annotations.
[10179.46 --> 10181.42]  So you could like click on it and interact with it
[10181.42 --> 10183.58]  and go to the sponsor's website and stuff like that.
[10183.58 --> 10187.42]  And what we definitely were for better or for worse
[10187.42 --> 10191.34]  was we were one of the first to explain it
[10191.34 --> 10197.08]  to our audience and explain how the economics of AdSense
[10197.08 --> 10202.04]  were not going to allow the scale that we could see
[10202.04 --> 10203.32]  for this,
[10203.46 --> 10204.58]  for this,
[10204.58 --> 10205.96]  um,
[10206.92 --> 10208.88]  media for this medium to grow.
[10209.78 --> 10210.30]  Um,
[10210.30 --> 10213.28]  and that there would need to be more to make it sustainable.
[10213.28 --> 10217.90]  And Google never to this day still hasn't figured out
[10217.90 --> 10222.62]  how to compete with the CPMs of your own internal sales team
[10222.62 --> 10224.72]  selling those placements,
[10224.72 --> 10225.46]  uh,
[10225.46 --> 10225.94]  somehow.
[10225.94 --> 10227.82]  And I remember getting into a somewhat,
[10227.82 --> 10229.04]  um,
[10229.04 --> 10230.04]  I wouldn't say heated,
[10230.24 --> 10234.24]  but maybe testy conversation with someone very high up
[10234.24 --> 10235.60]  at Google who works on,
[10235.66 --> 10236.62]  on the ad product,
[10236.62 --> 10241.84]  who basically was of the mind that our idiot advertisers
[10241.84 --> 10243.64]  are overpaying for those spots.
[10244.00 --> 10244.92]  And I said,
[10244.92 --> 10245.30]  no,
[10245.50 --> 10248.86]  your idiot product is not selling optimally enough
[10248.86 --> 10252.14]  because if you guys were getting the same CPMs that I was,
[10252.24 --> 10253.60]  I wouldn't even need to do it.
[10254.24 --> 10254.76]  What a bad take.
[10254.76 --> 10255.72]  We agreed to disagree.
[10255.94 --> 10256.94]  We agreed to disagree.
[10257.82 --> 10259.42]  What a terrible take.
[10262.16 --> 10262.60]  Whoa.
[10262.60 --> 10269.18]  I would not want a person with that opinion to lead a team that I was on.
[10269.26 --> 10269.42]  Well,
[10269.46 --> 10269.96]  it depends.
[10271.00 --> 10271.36]  No,
[10271.58 --> 10271.76]  no.
[10271.82 --> 10274.18]  Cause I don't want to be down on the guy because honestly,
[10274.18 --> 10277.04]  the reason I was talking to him in the first place was he's,
[10277.04 --> 10279.20]  he's smart as a whip.
[10279.38 --> 10283.02]  Like one of the smartest people that I've ever had the pleasure of speaking with.
[10283.14 --> 10285.84]  There is a reason that he's in the position he's in.
[10286.66 --> 10287.06]  However,
[10287.52 --> 10288.06]  however,
[10288.06 --> 10292.10]  I think people can end up in their bubble a little bit and he's in a very data
[10292.10 --> 10295.22]  driven bubble from his perspective.
[10295.22 --> 10296.94]  When it comes down to the raw data,
[10297.10 --> 10298.08]  he's right.
[10298.32 --> 10301.62]  They are overpaying because you should only pay a market rate.
[10302.76 --> 10304.56]  But from my perspective,
[10304.56 --> 10305.92]  where I,
[10306.12 --> 10311.76]  what I bring to the conversation is the human element where people add buyers
[10311.76 --> 10317.26]  do not buy necessarily only click through and conversion.
[10317.48 --> 10319.10]  They care about those things,
[10319.36 --> 10322.02]  especially a certain kind of buyer cares about those things.
[10322.10 --> 10323.72]  But if that was all that mattered,
[10324.06 --> 10327.36]  nobody would ever buy a Superbowl ad that would have no value.
[10328.36 --> 10328.88]  Right?
[10329.34 --> 10330.46]  Some ad buyers,
[10330.66 --> 10331.82]  it's more about the emotion.
[10332.12 --> 10332.46]  It's about,
[10332.58 --> 10335.44]  it's about building the connection between those brands.
[10335.84 --> 10339.10]  Why do you think AMD spends as much money as they spend?
[10339.48 --> 10341.14]  And don't kid yourself.
[10341.26 --> 10344.60]  They spend money on AMD ultimate tech upgrade.
[10344.60 --> 10347.82]  It's an emotional connection that they want.
[10348.38 --> 10352.52]  How many rise in CPUs do you think every AMD ultimate tech upgrade sells?
[10353.08 --> 10353.56]  A handful?
[10353.86 --> 10354.06]  Maybe.
[10354.52 --> 10355.80]  It's not about that.
[10356.36 --> 10365.24]  It's about AMD getting to be part of bringing positivity and being at the center of people's tech lives.
[10365.24 --> 10367.18]  That's what it's about.
[10367.92 --> 10368.68]  That's what,
[10368.68 --> 10369.80]  that's what they want.
[10370.12 --> 10373.26]  And they can't replicate that with just like,
[10373.50 --> 10377.48]  with just a data driven ad transaction product.
[10378.12 --> 10379.44]  You have to have both.
[10379.44 --> 10380.44]  Yeah.
[10383.00 --> 10383.44]  Yeah.
[10383.48 --> 10386.22]  I hope he has some more conversations with you in the future.
[10388.88 --> 10389.32]  Yeah.
[10389.72 --> 10390.00]  Sorry,
[10390.08 --> 10390.26]  what?
[10391.06 --> 10393.90]  I hope he has more conversations with you on that topic in the future.
[10394.20 --> 10394.46]  Well,
[10394.64 --> 10395.30]  cause I mean,
[10395.32 --> 10397.48]  one of the things that I was kind of pitching was I,
[10397.54 --> 10405.68]  I would love to have more tools for us selling against their integration tools.
[10405.80 --> 10406.04]  Yeah.
[10406.04 --> 10406.70]  Like why?
[10406.88 --> 10407.00]  Like,
[10407.60 --> 10407.90]  cause,
[10407.90 --> 10414.16]  which was what I was ultimately trying to get at was we know our product better than you ever could.
[10415.06 --> 10415.46]  And,
[10415.76 --> 10420.00]  and I don't have to prove that because I already did because I can sell it for more than you can.
[10421.56 --> 10424.56]  So either get good or let me be good.
[10425.12 --> 10428.50]  But what we're doing right now is I think creating a really,
[10428.68 --> 10430.08]  I think it creates a really,
[10430.08 --> 10432.18]  a fragmented product for the user.
[10432.44 --> 10435.42]  I think that for a user who pays for YouTube premium,
[10435.42 --> 10443.72]  the fact that so much baked in sponsorness is in their content is a really discombobulating experience.
[10443.72 --> 10445.90]  And I would love to streamline the product.
[10445.90 --> 10451.10]  And I would love to streamline the product so that if Google can figure out how to make their,
[10451.10 --> 10453.30]  their ad service products actually work.
[10453.30 --> 10459.10]  And if they can give us the tools where we can feed our own content into them,
[10459.10 --> 10464.08]  that could be a net benefit to both sides and a better experience for the users.
[10464.08 --> 10467.02]  If you could properly sell takeovers as well,
[10467.30 --> 10468.42]  I think ads would like that.
[10468.62 --> 10468.86]  Sorry.
[10468.86 --> 10469.08]  Uh,
[10469.08 --> 10470.42]  brands would like that.
[10470.98 --> 10471.40]  Um,
[10472.36 --> 10473.80]  like if you could have it so that the,
[10473.92 --> 10478.74]  the Google ads and the baked in ads on a video where we're from the same company.
[10479.08 --> 10479.52]  Yeah.
[10479.52 --> 10480.28]  I mean,
[10480.32 --> 10481.98]  Hatho says trust is important to me.
[10482.06 --> 10483.58]  The majority of the publications and channels,
[10483.64 --> 10486.26]  I don't trust their product recommendations without my own research,
[10486.26 --> 10489.16]  but with LTT's integrity and my investment as a viewer,
[10489.28 --> 10490.60]  product recommendations have weight.
[10490.72 --> 10492.04]  And that's something that we,
[10492.08 --> 10494.86]  we strive for and we don't always get it right.
[10494.90 --> 10496.80]  I want to make that abundantly clear.
[10497.04 --> 10499.72]  But what we do do is we take your feedback.
[10500.08 --> 10500.64]  He said,
[10500.74 --> 10500.84]  do,
[10500.90 --> 10501.02]  do,
[10501.40 --> 10501.60]  sorry.
[10501.74 --> 10506.60]  What we do do is we take your feedback and we bring that back to our business team
[10506.60 --> 10510.78]  and we make sure that they are constantly revising from a,
[10510.88 --> 10512.22]  from a category standpoint,
[10512.46 --> 10513.58]  from a,
[10513.70 --> 10514.30]  uh,
[10514.30 --> 10518.96]  from like a business type standpoint and even down to individual brand standpoint,
[10518.96 --> 10520.24]  who we're willing to work with.
[10523.40 --> 10523.80]  Yeah.
[10526.44 --> 10527.20]  I got him.
[10527.22 --> 10527.32]  All right.
[10527.32 --> 10527.86]  What do we got next?
[10529.36 --> 10529.76]  Um,
[10530.22 --> 10530.78]  I don't know.
[10531.76 --> 10532.68]  Digital foundry.
[10533.58 --> 10534.14]  Gabe Newell.
[10534.22 --> 10535.96]  I thought I said we're not doing this topic.
[10536.62 --> 10538.92]  Gabe Newell bought a super yacht manufacturer.
[10540.86 --> 10541.26]  Um,
[10542.10 --> 10542.52]  uh,
[10544.50 --> 10546.22]  should we talk about Microsoft and the keyboards thing?
[10546.32 --> 10547.34]  Why does no talk about that?
[10547.42 --> 10547.70]  Okay.
[10547.78 --> 10548.42]  Hold on a second.
[10548.52 --> 10548.94]  Actually,
[10549.30 --> 10553.04]  I have a completely almost unrelated topic of conversation.
[10554.18 --> 10554.66]  Why?
[10556.66 --> 10557.10]  Does,
[10557.60 --> 10562.32]  why does Gabe Newell seem to get a billionaire pass?
[10565.96 --> 10574.94]  Why does nobody seem to care that he just like floats around on multiple hundreds of millions of dollars yachts in times of financial turmoil,
[10574.94 --> 10577.16]  but we like hate Amazon for doing it?
[10579.48 --> 10579.92]  Um,
[10580.26 --> 10581.86]  or Bezos rather specifically.
[10581.86 --> 10582.90]  And like,
[10582.96 --> 10583.20]  okay,
[10583.20 --> 10583.48]  maybe,
[10583.72 --> 10583.92]  uh,
[10584.02 --> 10584.26]  okay,
[10584.34 --> 10587.02]  Bezos is probably a bad example because it's very clear why everyone hates him.
[10587.02 --> 10592.98]  Workers are like very clearly in an abusive relationship with the company.
[10593.70 --> 10594.14]  Um,
[10594.14 --> 10599.44]  I think that's honestly probably a lot of it.
[10599.60 --> 10600.98]  People like the product.
[10601.10 --> 10603.92]  People like steam and valve and the games that they make.
[10603.98 --> 10604.16]  Yeah.
[10604.16 --> 10604.96]  They like the product.
[10604.96 --> 10606.46]  And,
[10606.46 --> 10606.92]  but like,
[10607.00 --> 10607.38]  I mean,
[10607.46 --> 10609.00]  valve press around them.
[10609.00 --> 10613.68]  Like the press around Amazon is like the warehouse workers are like horrifically abused.
[10613.82 --> 10615.12]  And the drivers are peeing in bottles.
[10615.40 --> 10616.12]  And they're,
[10616.20 --> 10622.64]  they're like running out of people in the entire country of America that haven't at least worked there once and would be a,
[10622.68 --> 10626.90]  an eligible person to work there because they've cycled through so many people.
[10626.96 --> 10627.18]  Okay.
[10627.18 --> 10628.10]  No one wants to.
[10628.10 --> 10628.34]  Okay.
[10628.34 --> 10629.46]  Forget Bezos for a second.
[10629.50 --> 10630.60]  What about like Larry Ellison?
[10631.28 --> 10631.54]  Okay.
[10631.58 --> 10631.94]  Nobody,
[10632.18 --> 10632.92]  nobody likes.
[10633.08 --> 10633.56]  Oracle is a,
[10633.56 --> 10634.86]  nobody likes Oracle.
[10634.86 --> 10635.26]  Impressive,
[10635.50 --> 10636.42]  horrible thing.
[10636.62 --> 10637.70]  But nobody seems to,
[10637.70 --> 10641.96]  nobody seems to like hate Ellison for having a giant yacht or a plane or whatever.
[10642.36 --> 10642.78]  I think they do.
[10642.78 --> 10643.18]  What's the difference?
[10643.26 --> 10644.48]  I think a lot of people hate Ellison.
[10644.80 --> 10646.10]  I think tons of people hate Ellison.
[10646.36 --> 10646.60]  Oh,
[10646.68 --> 10646.88]  okay.
[10646.88 --> 10647.92]  I think if you ask the chat right now,
[10647.98 --> 10649.08]  people really hate Ellison.
[10650.42 --> 10650.84]  Hold on.
[10650.86 --> 10651.86]  He's just not as public.
[10652.18 --> 10652.38]  He,
[10652.46 --> 10655.64]  he like is not as in people's faces.
[10656.30 --> 10656.74]  Um,
[10656.88 --> 10657.16]  yeah.
[10657.16 --> 10657.44]  Okay.
[10657.44 --> 10659.86]  People that do know about Oracle hate Ellison for sure.
[10660.48 --> 10660.80]  Okay.
[10660.84 --> 10661.30]  So hold on.
[10661.34 --> 10662.10]  Chat's got some takes.
[10662.18 --> 10663.02]  Chat's got some takes.
[10663.56 --> 10664.18]  Um,
[10665.04 --> 10665.70]  Hatho says,
[10665.82 --> 10668.52]  while I personally think billionaires shouldn't exist,
[10668.66 --> 10670.42]  valve has made the lives of consumers better.
[10670.98 --> 10673.92]  Amazon has made the lives of consumers worse in many aspects.
[10673.92 --> 10674.22]  Okay.
[10674.76 --> 10675.90]  I think that's pretty fair.
[10676.04 --> 10676.72]  Crystal says,
[10676.86 --> 10677.60]  cause he just,
[10677.82 --> 10680.82]  cause Newell doesn't just like actively make things worse.
[10681.28 --> 10681.84]  Um,
[10681.90 --> 10682.46]  Amazon done.
[10682.54 --> 10684.20]  That has made the lives of consumers worse.
[10684.50 --> 10685.02]  I mean,
[10685.02 --> 10687.58]  they completely and shitified online shopping.
[10687.58 --> 10688.02]  I,
[10688.02 --> 10689.68]  I will never forgive them.
[10690.46 --> 10690.90]  Honestly.
[10691.72 --> 10693.08]  Compared to where they were,
[10693.14 --> 10693.48]  I guess.
[10693.54 --> 10694.84]  So they should find their own product.
[10694.98 --> 10695.12]  Yeah.
[10695.22 --> 10695.92]  But I mean,
[10695.96 --> 10696.22]  okay.
[10696.26 --> 10698.40]  But we could have had never and should have fights.
[10698.52 --> 10698.78]  I mean,
[10698.78 --> 10699.06]  look,
[10699.20 --> 10699.44]  Luke,
[10699.44 --> 10701.52]  you and I have talked about this so much.
[10701.62 --> 10703.06]  The Silicon Valley model,
[10703.34 --> 10703.60]  right?
[10703.66 --> 10705.30]  Where you take all of the,
[10705.40 --> 10706.84]  you take all the VC funding,
[10707.14 --> 10709.40]  you use it to push everybody else out.
[10709.56 --> 10712.58]  Like Uber basically killed taxis,
[10712.70 --> 10714.56]  which were their own problem.
[10714.56 --> 10714.94]  Honestly,
[10715.02 --> 10717.76]  I have no sympathy for the taxi cartels,
[10717.92 --> 10722.18]  but they basically like used free money,
[10722.28 --> 10726.62]  the free money water hose to wash away the taxis and then jacked up the rate.
[10726.72 --> 10727.64]  So now like,
[10728.48 --> 10728.86]  okay.
[10728.90 --> 10729.10]  Yeah.
[10729.18 --> 10729.74]  So it's,
[10729.74 --> 10735.08]  so they hurt companies that already existed that deserve to still be able to,
[10735.18 --> 10736.08]  or they hurt.
[10736.22 --> 10736.34]  I mean,
[10736.34 --> 10737.70]  that's consumer patterns.
[10737.88 --> 10738.68]  Or they hurt.
[10738.92 --> 10739.08]  No,
[10739.12 --> 10739.24]  no.
[10739.30 --> 10739.96]  With Amazon,
[10740.12 --> 10740.38]  hold on,
[10740.38 --> 10740.62]  hold on.
[10740.62 --> 10741.36]  Hold on.
[10741.42 --> 10742.42]  I'm not done with Amazon though.
[10742.68 --> 10744.46]  Cause what Amazon harmed,
[10744.56 --> 10748.28]  was the development of a more organic,
[10748.82 --> 10753.54]  healthier ecosystem by just hoovering up everything in their path.
[10753.64 --> 10756.26]  Use by not making money for so long.
[10756.56 --> 10757.96]  And maybe I'm just a,
[10758.14 --> 10758.80]  I can't bleep it,
[10758.88 --> 10760.82]  but maybe I'm just a bad word for,
[10760.92 --> 10761.96]  for approaching this this way.
[10762.02 --> 10762.50]  But I don't know,
[10762.56 --> 10762.72]  man.
[10762.78 --> 10762.92]  I,
[10763.00 --> 10770.22]  I think Amazon created the opportunity and people showed up.
[10770.40 --> 10772.66]  People stopped going to those brick and mortars.
[10772.78 --> 10774.36]  People bought in heavily.
[10774.36 --> 10775.46]  But in the early days,
[10775.46 --> 10777.36]  they were so strongly incentivized.
[10777.36 --> 10780.44]  The shipping was free and the product costs the same or less.
[10781.20 --> 10781.84]  So they,
[10781.84 --> 10782.62]  they sold us.
[10782.72 --> 10786.22]  All the writing was aggressively painted in blood on the wall.
[10786.22 --> 10786.54]  Oh,
[10786.60 --> 10786.80]  I mean,
[10786.84 --> 10788.32]  you can't brick and mortars were going to die.
[10788.46 --> 10791.46]  You can't expect the average consumer to see that far in the future.
[10791.54 --> 10792.26]  They're not that smart.
[10792.26 --> 10795.52]  I mean,
[10795.70 --> 10797.68]  Amazon sold us a future.
[10797.94 --> 10800.62]  Amazon sold us a future and then rug pulled it.
[10800.74 --> 10801.52]  Like that's,
[10801.62 --> 10802.94]  that's what people are mad about.
[10803.88 --> 10804.88]  They need to get good.
[10804.94 --> 10806.22]  It was talked about so much.
[10806.28 --> 10806.76]  It was in,
[10806.86 --> 10808.20]  it was in TV news.
[10808.66 --> 10808.92]  Yeah.
[10809.04 --> 10809.36]  That,
[10809.36 --> 10810.94]  that all the brick and mortars were going to die.
[10811.02 --> 10812.96]  This was like an extremely well-known thing.
[10812.96 --> 10814.68]  And people just bought in anyways.
[10814.90 --> 10821.14]  They didn't care about the brick and mortars until Amazon exercised their monopoly.
[10821.14 --> 10822.14]  Uh,
[10823.18 --> 10823.88]  and then they were like,
[10823.94 --> 10824.10]  Oh,
[10824.14 --> 10827.06]  think about the people that we definitely killed by only buying from Amazon.
[10827.94 --> 10828.34]  Um,
[10829.14 --> 10830.68]  I don't know.
[10830.74 --> 10831.00]  Anyways.
[10831.10 --> 10831.26]  Yeah.
[10831.30 --> 10833.04]  Amazon's obviously trash.
[10835.40 --> 10835.88]  Uh,
[10835.92 --> 10841.92]  breakdown says gamers are incredibly tribalistic and steam is one of their friendly tribes.
[10842.50 --> 10844.18]  So gaming can do no wrong.
[10844.70 --> 10847.16]  Breakdown 1923 says nobody hates Jensen.
[10847.72 --> 10848.24]  Yeah.
[10848.72 --> 10849.26]  I don't know about that.
[10849.26 --> 10851.12]  People absolutely don't like Jensen.
[10851.14 --> 10851.32]  Yeah.
[10851.36 --> 10852.04]  I think there's,
[10852.14 --> 10852.48]  I think,
[10852.60 --> 10855.50]  I think Jensen is probably more liked than most of them.
[10855.74 --> 10856.10]  You know what?
[10856.12 --> 10857.40]  I think that's probably fair.
[10857.50 --> 10861.60]  Cause the worst thing he seems to do is make a lot of money,
[10861.60 --> 10864.22]  which is sort of par for the course when you're a billionaire.
[10864.78 --> 10865.60]  Like that's just,
[10865.74 --> 10867.10]  it kind of comes with the territory.
[10867.18 --> 10868.20]  He lies all the time.
[10869.70 --> 10870.02]  Yeah,
[10870.12 --> 10870.48]  that's,
[10870.62 --> 10871.18]  that's true.
[10871.34 --> 10872.54]  Why do we let him get away with that?
[10872.62 --> 10872.90]  I guess,
[10872.96 --> 10873.06]  well,
[10873.12 --> 10873.58]  we don't,
[10873.68 --> 10877.20]  but why do people in general seem to still just kind of love them?
[10877.20 --> 10880.70]  I guess they just have like Nvidia and their 401k and they're just over it.
[10880.70 --> 10881.14]  Like,
[10881.18 --> 10881.82]  is it that simple?
[10881.96 --> 10883.74]  Probably a lot of people are just like,
[10883.80 --> 10883.98]  yeah,
[10884.06 --> 10885.14]  guy made me a lot of money.
[10886.10 --> 10886.94]  It is what it is.
[10888.06 --> 10888.42]  Hmm.
[10889.16 --> 10889.86]  What else am I looking?
[10890.08 --> 10890.44]  Okay.
[10890.44 --> 10891.28]  What else we got here?
[10892.92 --> 10893.32]  Um,
[10893.32 --> 10894.88]  okay.
[10895.38 --> 10895.70]  Okay.
[10895.76 --> 10895.88]  Oh,
[10895.92 --> 10897.24]  people are talking about Ellison a lot.
[10897.32 --> 10897.44]  Okay.
[10897.44 --> 10899.48]  I'm going to have to scroll for a while to get past that.
[10902.18 --> 10902.38]  Uh,
[10902.38 --> 10904.48]  Tim says we randomly give Oprah a pass.
[10904.84 --> 10905.20]  Yeah.
[10905.60 --> 10905.96]  Actually,
[10905.96 --> 10908.06]  she seems to be kind of hated by a lot of people.
[10908.44 --> 10908.58]  Yeah.
[10908.60 --> 10910.30]  She does not have a pass for sure.
[10910.92 --> 10911.90]  It's funny too,
[10911.96 --> 10912.12]  though,
[10912.12 --> 10915.26]  because like most of the billionaires in the world,
[10915.30 --> 10916.26]  we don't even know their names.
[10916.30 --> 10917.44]  The only ones we know,
[10918.40 --> 10920.92]  we just like kind of hate because they're just in the public eye,
[10920.98 --> 10925.78]  but there's a lot of billionaires out there that just kind of quietly make their money.
[10925.78 --> 10926.78]  And we don't,
[10926.78 --> 10928.26]  we don't give them a second thought.
[10928.40 --> 10928.52]  A lot.
[10928.60 --> 10929.94]  Even with the ones that are public,
[10929.94 --> 10930.78]  like you pointed out,
[10930.84 --> 10931.16]  Larry,
[10931.80 --> 10932.14]  uh,
[10932.14 --> 10936.70]  he's just not like as public as someone like Elon or Bezos.
[10936.70 --> 10937.78]  Um,
[10938.22 --> 10938.80]  so that,
[10938.86 --> 10940.16]  that's almost entirely,
[10940.30 --> 10942.04]  I'm certain why you had that perspective.
[10942.56 --> 10943.00]  Um,
[10943.02 --> 10945.24]  but there's a ton of them that just aren't public at all.
[10945.86 --> 10946.26]  Uh,
[10946.54 --> 10948.00]  yeah.
[10950.90 --> 10955.90]  This has generated a ton of conversation.
[10956.10 --> 10956.66]  Sydney broke.
[10956.70 --> 10960.18]  It says a lot of the Oprah hate is because she platformed a bunch of really awful,
[10960.30 --> 10960.90]  stupid people.
[10961.14 --> 10962.16]  That kind of makes sense.
[10962.20 --> 10965.28]  But I guess if you had like a daytime show for that many years,
[10965.28 --> 10967.94]  would you run out of like credible people to talk to?
[10968.06 --> 10968.32]  I mean,
[10968.32 --> 10971.08]  I never watched Oprah interview anyone to be perfectly honest with you.
[10971.12 --> 10971.92]  So I have no idea.
[10971.92 --> 10972.12]  Like,
[10972.14 --> 10972.68]  does she just,
[10973.02 --> 10975.10]  is she just positive with everybody about everything?
[10976.18 --> 10976.58]  Like,
[10976.62 --> 10977.90]  I genuinely don't know.
[10977.90 --> 10980.60]  I never had a reason to like watch the Oprah Winfrey show.
[10980.76 --> 10980.84]  I'm,
[10980.96 --> 10985.62]  I just know about you get a car and you get a car.
[10985.76 --> 10985.80]  Like,
[10985.86 --> 10986.50]  that's all I know.
[10987.46 --> 10987.76]  Yeah.
[10987.90 --> 10988.40]  Me too.
[10988.60 --> 10989.94]  I don't necessarily agree.
[10990.40 --> 10990.64]  And,
[10990.82 --> 10990.94]  you know,
[10990.98 --> 10993.06]  I don't know the Oprah situation here.
[10993.62 --> 10993.98]  Um,
[10993.98 --> 10995.82]  and I know some of them are pretty brutal,
[10995.92 --> 10997.08]  but I don't necessarily agree with the,
[10997.16 --> 10997.28]  like,
[10997.54 --> 10999.08]  if you have a conversation with someone,
[10999.08 --> 10999.84]  uh,
[10999.84 --> 11001.78]  you automatically condone everything that they say.
[11001.86 --> 11003.20]  I don't think if you interview someone,
[11003.30 --> 11005.02]  you automatically condone everything they say.
[11005.54 --> 11005.94]  Um,
[11006.74 --> 11007.48]  yeah,
[11007.88 --> 11008.04]  no,
[11008.06 --> 11008.42]  they're making,
[11008.60 --> 11010.46]  they're making some pretty good arguments in the chat.
[11010.52 --> 11011.40]  They're making some pretty,
[11011.40 --> 11012.98]  I don't know the ones they're talking about.
[11012.98 --> 11013.78]  Just like people,
[11014.04 --> 11021.98]  like longterm promotion of people like who literally have gone on the record saying they promoted quack medicine and no one should believe them anyway.
[11021.98 --> 11023.78]  And then they just keep doing it.
[11023.88 --> 11024.08]  Yeah.
[11024.22 --> 11024.96]  Like people like that.
[11025.10 --> 11025.22]  And they,
[11025.34 --> 11028.02]  and if she platforms that person multiple times,
[11028.02 --> 11029.00]  then it becomes a thing.
[11029.30 --> 11029.70]  Yeah.
[11029.70 --> 11032.62]  I just think that like having a conversation one time,
[11032.70 --> 11035.00]  not necessarily automatically agreeing with everything,
[11035.00 --> 11039.96]  but having a conversation one time should not be frowned upon 100%.
[11039.96 --> 11040.58]  I think it's,
[11040.76 --> 11041.58]  there's some amount of like,
[11041.62 --> 11045.62]  if you're a content creator and I'm including TV show hosts,
[11045.66 --> 11047.84]  I'm including literally anyone in the public eye,
[11047.88 --> 11048.10]  really.
[11048.42 --> 11050.84]  If you write things,
[11051.00 --> 11051.66]  say things,
[11051.78 --> 11052.44]  host things,
[11052.56 --> 11054.00]  whatever that's public,
[11054.42 --> 11058.68]  your life is probably far more recorded than anyone else's.
[11058.78 --> 11066.02]  And if you took that same level of spyglass and looked at like any one of your random buddies,
[11066.02 --> 11071.14]  they probably have said and done dumb things as well.
[11071.52 --> 11072.64]  So I think like the,
[11072.74 --> 11072.80]  Oh,
[11072.84 --> 11076.54]  this one person said something that the internet disagreed with one time.
[11076.72 --> 11077.16]  Therefore,
[11077.16 --> 11078.46]  if you even look in their direction,
[11078.52 --> 11082.86]  you are automatically evil is like a stupid thing that we need to stop doing.
[11083.14 --> 11083.64]  That's fair.
[11084.62 --> 11085.06]  Whatever.
[11086.12 --> 11087.96]  So then I should get a gamer yacht.
[11088.96 --> 11090.30]  Is that the correct conclusion?
[11090.30 --> 11094.96]  You should get a game or something.
[11095.12 --> 11095.96]  Game or something.
[11096.30 --> 11096.52]  How about,
[11096.82 --> 11097.34]  how about a yacht?
[11098.58 --> 11098.90]  Sorry.
[11099.06 --> 11099.38]  Sorry.
[11099.46 --> 11099.70]  Yacht.
[11099.92 --> 11101.38]  I pronounced it wrong the first time.
[11101.76 --> 11104.88]  If it's a yacht and you exclusively call it a yacht,
[11105.18 --> 11106.22]  then I think so.
[11106.58 --> 11106.72]  Yeah.
[11107.82 --> 11108.26]  Okay.
[11108.28 --> 11108.68]  We should,
[11109.04 --> 11109.24]  Dan,
[11109.32 --> 11110.44]  can you let the chat vote?
[11111.22 --> 11112.34]  Gamer jet or gamer yacht?
[11112.90 --> 11113.42]  I love it.
[11114.54 --> 11115.54]  Gamer ski lift.
[11115.78 --> 11116.00]  Are we assuming,
[11116.16 --> 11117.76]  are we assuming same price?
[11118.68 --> 11119.08]  Um,
[11119.08 --> 11121.48]  gamer ski lift would be pretty sick.
[11121.64 --> 11122.42]  Gamer ski lift.
[11122.46 --> 11123.18]  Where would it go?
[11124.22 --> 11124.64]  Like,
[11124.68 --> 11125.50]  where would we put it?
[11126.64 --> 11129.26]  You should work with like Seymour.
[11129.84 --> 11135.48]  If you could mount compute on the bottom of the seat,
[11136.52 --> 11140.50]  and then you can have arms like those airplane arms where the screen comes up.
[11140.82 --> 11141.26]  Yeah.
[11141.44 --> 11143.16]  So you could like game on your way up the mountain.
[11143.30 --> 11143.92]  We could get like,
[11144.26 --> 11144.60]  Oh,
[11144.68 --> 11144.98]  we could,
[11145.10 --> 11148.94]  we could use like adaptive controllers to make like special big glove compatible,
[11149.08 --> 11149.58]  controllers.
[11149.88 --> 11151.62]  So you don't have to take your gloves off.
[11152.54 --> 11152.90]  Yeah.
[11154.74 --> 11155.40]  That'd be sick.
[11155.42 --> 11155.54]  Yeah.
[11155.62 --> 11157.82]  Pankrat says you could just mount everything to the safety bar.
[11158.04 --> 11159.34]  So you just pull it down.
[11161.86 --> 11162.22]  Yeah.
[11163.06 --> 11163.42]  Ah,
[11163.60 --> 11164.48]  ah,
[11164.48 --> 11166.06]  we could go between the buildings.
[11166.06 --> 11168.80]  Yeah.
[11168.80 --> 11170.34]  The screens could go on the safety bar.
[11170.80 --> 11171.72]  Like how much does that,
[11171.78 --> 11173.02]  how much does a ski lift cost?
[11173.12 --> 11174.52]  I bet there's one on Facebook marketplace.
[11176.74 --> 11177.44]  Ski lift.
[11178.10 --> 11178.88]  We're going to find out.
[11180.00 --> 11180.70]  No way.
[11180.94 --> 11182.62]  I can buy a ski lift chair.
[11183.16 --> 11183.90]  That's it though.
[11184.02 --> 11184.26]  Okay.
[11184.26 --> 11184.76]  I don't know.
[11184.76 --> 11187.26]  I don't know if gaming ski lift is going to happen boys.
[11188.22 --> 11189.48]  I don't think it's going to happen.
[11189.94 --> 11192.98]  I wonder if infinite cables could send us a giant wire rope.
[11193.92 --> 11197.10]  The reason why I said under the seat is because there'd be more weather protected.
[11197.76 --> 11198.20]  Hmm.
[11198.54 --> 11199.20]  That makes sense.
[11199.30 --> 11199.90]  That makes sense.
[11200.14 --> 11202.76]  Having all of your stuff on the bars.
[11203.84 --> 11204.24]  Well,
[11204.34 --> 11205.82]  I don't think you'd have the compute there,
[11205.94 --> 11207.24]  but you could have the,
[11207.38 --> 11209.06]  but you could have the monitor there.
[11209.70 --> 11210.06]  Yeah.
[11210.06 --> 11211.60]  They make weatherproof displays.
[11211.86 --> 11213.02]  That should be fine.
[11213.02 --> 11215.02]  Okay.
[11215.60 --> 11216.06]  Where's the,
[11216.06 --> 11217.88]  you won't get a hundred percent away from the weather regardless,
[11218.14 --> 11219.64]  but where's the pole?
[11220.16 --> 11221.36]  The seat would be the best.
[11221.52 --> 11222.34]  Where's my pole at?
[11223.30 --> 11223.70]  Um,
[11224.20 --> 11226.16]  it's about 20 to 80 on the yacht.
[11228.40 --> 11228.80]  Uh,
[11228.92 --> 11229.22]  well,
[11229.28 --> 11229.38]  where,
[11229.46 --> 11230.18]  where is it?
[11230.24 --> 11230.70]  Why don't I,
[11230.78 --> 11231.38]  why don't I see it?
[11231.42 --> 11232.06]  You might have to refresh.
[11232.62 --> 11234.88]  Poles aren't 100% functional at the moment.
[11235.16 --> 11235.42]  Ah,
[11235.62 --> 11235.86]  okay.
[11235.88 --> 11236.08]  So,
[11236.16 --> 11236.30]  sorry,
[11236.30 --> 11236.98]  which one's winning?
[11237.10 --> 11238.00]  Works on my machine.
[11238.46 --> 11238.90]  Um,
[11239.02 --> 11241.10]  the yacht by 80%.
[11241.10 --> 11241.92]  The yacht's winning.
[11242.16 --> 11242.36]  Sorry.
[11242.44 --> 11242.60]  Yeah.
[11243.02 --> 11243.42]  Oh,
[11243.80 --> 11244.50]  my mistake.
[11244.72 --> 11245.60]  Now we're going to be canceled.
[11245.78 --> 11246.56]  I'm so sorry.
[11246.94 --> 11247.14]  Yeah,
[11247.14 --> 11247.98]  you can't do it now.
[11248.04 --> 11248.76]  You can't do the,
[11248.76 --> 11251.24]  the yacht now because Dan called it a yacht.
[11251.88 --> 11252.18]  All right.
[11252.26 --> 11254.16]  The rule was that it had to be referred to as yashed.
[11255.22 --> 11256.32]  In other news,
[11256.70 --> 11257.00]  uh,
[11257.06 --> 11259.66]  Nvidia published a blog post on August 5th,
[11259.70 --> 11265.56]  clearing up some concerns that people had about Nvidia having kill switches or built-in controls to brick GPUs.
[11265.96 --> 11266.36]  They,
[11266.50 --> 11267.28]  um,
[11267.28 --> 11271.34]  said Nvidia GPUs do not and should not have kill switches and back doors.
[11272.34 --> 11272.76]  All right.
[11273.16 --> 11273.54]  I mean,
[11273.54 --> 11275.04]  that should probably be the bare minimum,
[11275.04 --> 11275.64]  but hey,
[11276.20 --> 11276.54]  um,
[11276.58 --> 11277.30]  at least they,
[11277.46 --> 11279.14]  at least they've taken a stand here.
[11279.14 --> 11280.46]  In other news,
[11280.62 --> 11282.58]  TikTok has a better app.
[11283.12 --> 11284.12]  TikTok pro.
[11285.12 --> 11285.36]  Yeah.
[11285.52 --> 11286.00]  How is this?
[11286.06 --> 11287.24]  I have no idea.
[11287.64 --> 11287.78]  I,
[11287.78 --> 11291.84]  so I literally made this a topic because I didn't understand the article that I read about it.
[11291.84 --> 11294.62]  So hopefully Elijah has done a great job of summarizing it.
[11295.14 --> 11296.98]  TikTok is launching a new app in Germany,
[11297.14 --> 11297.38]  Portugal,
[11297.38 --> 11298.32]  and Spain called,
[11298.50 --> 11299.66]  wait for it.
[11300.50 --> 11301.36]  TikTok pro.
[11302.10 --> 11310.74]  It features a new sunshine program that allows users to contribute and support charitable organizations.
[11311.86 --> 11319.20]  Users earn virtual sunshine by inviting other users to join and interact with the charity related content.
[11319.20 --> 11328.20]  They can then use this virtual sunshine on a charity and then TikTok will donate toward that charity.
[11329.54 --> 11329.98]  Yeah.
[11330.06 --> 11331.62]  The look on your face says it all.
[11331.76 --> 11334.10]  You have like a Canyon running between your eyes.
[11334.20 --> 11334.72]  And that was,
[11334.86 --> 11336.42]  I'm pretty sure what I looked like.
[11337.34 --> 11337.82]  Um,
[11337.94 --> 11338.72]  you're a wizard,
[11338.88 --> 11339.08]  Harry.
[11339.70 --> 11340.68]  Other than that,
[11341.24 --> 11341.48]  TikTok.
[11341.64 --> 11345.24]  I'm trying to figure out if you're talking about the furrow or the actual dent in my head at this point.
[11345.32 --> 11346.08]  I'm not sure.
[11347.10 --> 11347.90]  Other than that,
[11347.90 --> 11350.30]  TikTok pro is the exact same.
[11350.52 --> 11352.12]  The content is the same.
[11352.44 --> 11355.50]  And even the overall experience is the same,
[11355.76 --> 11356.52]  mostly the same.
[11356.72 --> 11358.78]  According to social media today,
[11358.78 --> 11360.80]  it is missing live stream,
[11361.12 --> 11362.20]  live streaming,
[11362.68 --> 11365.20]  the TikTok shop and ads.
[11368.10 --> 11370.56]  What is it?
[11370.56 --> 11371.46]  Because I,
[11371.60 --> 11372.64]  when I heard TikTok pro,
[11372.64 --> 11374.00]  I assumed it was like,
[11374.10 --> 11383.88]  I assumed it was a paid version of the app because of some of the new laws in Europe around like miners and or data collection or something.
[11384.18 --> 11385.18]  But then it,
[11386.18 --> 11387.48]  virtual sunshine.
[11387.72 --> 11389.00]  But what is this?
[11389.10 --> 11390.34]  Am I missing something here?
[11390.34 --> 11391.78]  Yeah.
[11394.00 --> 11397.94]  Elijah's point here is actually really good.
[11399.46 --> 11399.86]  Um,
[11400.08 --> 11401.38]  why do you think TikTok is doing this?
[11401.44 --> 11402.16]  Because on the surface,
[11402.24 --> 11404.32]  there seems like there's no downside as a user,
[11404.50 --> 11405.34]  no ads,
[11405.50 --> 11407.52]  no TikTok shop being shoved in your face.
[11407.56 --> 11411.48]  And it maintains all the core TikTok features other than live streams.
[11411.48 --> 11412.64]  But as far as my understanding goes,
[11413.06 --> 11416.10]  TikTok live streams just generally kind of suck anyways.
[11417.26 --> 11417.70]  So.
[11418.36 --> 11419.52]  I don't understand it.
[11420.84 --> 11421.60]  Seems weird.
[11422.08 --> 11422.44]  Okay.
[11422.64 --> 11423.16]  So,
[11423.22 --> 11423.38]  uh,
[11423.38 --> 11424.70]  we have no additional clarity.
[11425.82 --> 11426.34]  Nope.
[11426.92 --> 11427.34]  Neat.
[11427.46 --> 11428.36]  Let's go to After Dark.
[11429.40 --> 11429.88]  Okay.
[11431.02 --> 11433.14]  Did we only ever do one merch message earlier?
[11434.54 --> 11435.02]  Oh,
[11435.10 --> 11435.38]  Lordy,
[11435.44 --> 11436.86]  there were a lot of merch messages today.
[11437.70 --> 11438.22]  Oh,
[11438.26 --> 11438.38]  yeah.
[11439.04 --> 11439.44]  Uh,
[11439.44 --> 11439.68]  cool.
[11439.68 --> 11442.74]  I did not expect people to be so excited about stickers.
[11443.74 --> 11446.06]  Some people bought stuff just for the stickers.
[11446.18 --> 11447.06]  Dbrand's onto something.
[11448.68 --> 11449.10]  Oh,
[11449.16 --> 11450.16]  and also the stickers.
[11450.76 --> 11451.56]  There's two lots of stickers.
[11451.64 --> 11452.52]  Lots of people buying stickers.
[11452.54 --> 11453.62]  I'm so confused about Elijah making a good point.
[11453.72 --> 11453.92]  No.
[11454.62 --> 11455.02]  No.
[11455.38 --> 11455.78]  Incorrect.
[11456.82 --> 11457.22]  False.
[11457.80 --> 11458.38]  Fake news.
[11459.82 --> 11460.76]  Our friends called me.
[11460.88 --> 11461.18]  That just,
[11461.44 --> 11463.26]  that fake news just means it's real news,
[11463.36 --> 11464.70]  but it inconveniences me.
[11466.34 --> 11468.32]  The meaning of fake news has changed.
[11468.76 --> 11469.66]  That sounds like fake news.
[11469.98 --> 11470.56]  It's not,
[11470.58 --> 11471.44]  it's not fake news then.
[11471.54 --> 11471.72]  It's,
[11471.82 --> 11472.20]  uh,
[11472.64 --> 11473.24]  it's just,
[11473.40 --> 11474.70]  it's just lies.
[11475.50 --> 11475.90]  Yeah.
[11478.94 --> 11479.90]  Shall we begin?
[11480.00 --> 11480.60]  Can you make your light?
[11480.60 --> 11480.78]  Yeah.
[11480.82 --> 11481.16]  Anytime.
[11481.28 --> 11481.40]  Yeah.
[11482.50 --> 11483.68]  I can make you purple.
[11484.36 --> 11485.20]  Oh my God.
[11486.96 --> 11488.88]  And I just take lift down.
[11490.62 --> 11491.42]  There we go.
[11491.62 --> 11491.78]  Sorry.
[11491.84 --> 11491.96]  Yeah.
[11491.96 --> 11493.86]  I'm in Vegas right now.
[11494.12 --> 11496.32]  And I just looked outside to be like,
[11496.40 --> 11497.38]  is there purple lights?
[11497.48 --> 11497.90]  Cause I don't know.
[11497.94 --> 11498.34]  I'm in Vegas.
[11498.44 --> 11499.50]  I can just open the windows more.
[11500.06 --> 11507.02]  And there's like horrifically drawn animated cats dancing on the sphere.
[11507.02 --> 11510.14]  Life is strange.
[11510.44 --> 11511.18]  Vegas moment.
[11512.88 --> 11513.28]  Yeah.
[11513.66 --> 11516.08]  I'm assuming it's a Defcon Vegas moment.
[11516.86 --> 11517.44]  Makes sense.
[11517.62 --> 11517.94]  Uh,
[11518.64 --> 11520.00]  anyways.
[11520.14 --> 11520.94]  Now you're purple.
[11522.24 --> 11522.70]  Oh wow.
[11522.86 --> 11523.22]  Nice.
[11523.52 --> 11524.08]  I like it.
[11524.34 --> 11524.58]  Whoa.
[11524.72 --> 11524.94]  Kate.
[11525.18 --> 11526.38]  It's wait,
[11526.48 --> 11526.66]  what?
[11527.04 --> 11527.74]  He's working on it.
[11527.78 --> 11527.94]  No,
[11527.96 --> 11528.08]  no,
[11528.08 --> 11528.22]  no.
[11528.26 --> 11529.16]  Dan's tuning it.
[11529.22 --> 11529.60]  There we go.
[11529.84 --> 11530.10]  Okay.
[11530.20 --> 11530.66]  Purple loop.
[11530.72 --> 11530.82]  Yeah.
[11530.82 --> 11531.48]  Don't overthink it.
[11531.74 --> 11532.06]  Hello.
[11532.56 --> 11533.88]  Big fan of your videos.
[11534.14 --> 11534.28]  Oh,
[11534.30 --> 11535.22]  can you show us the cats?
[11535.86 --> 11536.40]  Oh my God.
[11537.26 --> 11537.66]  Oh,
[11537.72 --> 11539.04]  it just changed.
[11539.26 --> 11539.66]  Okay.
[11540.30 --> 11540.70]  Wow.
[11540.86 --> 11541.10]  Tease.
[11541.58 --> 11542.34]  if they come back,
[11542.42 --> 11542.76]  then yeah,
[11542.94 --> 11543.44]  I'll do it.
[11544.04 --> 11544.52]  All right.
[11544.56 --> 11546.00]  Let's get through some of these.
[11546.50 --> 11546.72]  Hello.
[11546.82 --> 11547.82]  Big fan of your videos.
[11547.82 --> 11552.58]  A large popular topic has always been how much VRAM or RAM is required in current year.
[11552.90 --> 11553.76]  But what about storage?
[11553.96 --> 11556.78]  What would that be the minimum amount of storage to have in 2025?
[11557.24 --> 11558.74]  The reason that we don't really,
[11559.78 --> 11561.96]  the reason we don't provide like,
[11561.96 --> 11567.06]  a minimum amount of storage recommendation is that it is completely up to you,
[11567.14 --> 11568.14]  the user to decide.
[11568.70 --> 11570.18]  Realistically for my work laptop,
[11570.18 --> 11572.52]  I could probably get by with like 256 gigs.
[11572.82 --> 11574.06]  I don't store anything on it.
[11574.80 --> 11576.82]  I don't keep games on it.
[11576.92 --> 11582.44]  I don't keep media on it because all of the resources that I need to access are either in the cloud
[11582.44 --> 11586.30]  or on a local network attached storage device.
[11588.14 --> 11591.34]  But that answer is not going to be good for anyone who does,
[11591.34 --> 11592.20]  say for example,
[11592.20 --> 11596.02]  local video editing on their laptop.
[11596.02 --> 11600.62]  So only you can answer the question of how much storage you need.
[11600.94 --> 11606.08]  And there's no point in me even guessing because I have absolutely no way of knowing
[11606.08 --> 11607.12]  how much,
[11607.12 --> 11607.86]  you know,
[11608.64 --> 11612.70]  anime pornography you need in your life.
[11612.70 --> 11616.72]  You watch the WAN show,
[11616.80 --> 11617.62]  so I assume a lot.
[11617.80 --> 11620.04]  That's why we have a six petabyte NAS at work.
[11621.24 --> 11621.62]  Yeah,
[11621.68 --> 11622.58]  it's for all of that.
[11622.96 --> 11623.18]  Yeah.
[11623.82 --> 11624.66]  Man of culture.
[11624.66 --> 11625.14]  Hello,
[11625.34 --> 11625.80]  LDL.
[11625.88 --> 11627.98]  Any upcoming games that you're highly anticipating?
[11628.18 --> 11631.02]  Any old game that you want to get people to play at Whale Land?
[11631.02 --> 11632.54]  Oh,
[11632.88 --> 11633.38]  oh,
[11633.46 --> 11634.32]  this is interesting.
[11635.06 --> 11635.74]  Carpoon launched.
[11636.34 --> 11637.18]  Dang it.
[11638.10 --> 11638.68]  Got it.
[11638.80 --> 11639.62]  Got it.
[11640.22 --> 11640.82]  Got it.
[11640.88 --> 11640.96]  Got it.
[11645.44 --> 11646.64]  Why are you like this?
[11646.64 --> 11651.60]  So my bud,
[11651.72 --> 11652.70]  Tom Arnold,
[11655.36 --> 11656.42]  who goes by,
[11656.42 --> 11658.62]  who goes by the developer handle,
[11658.98 --> 11660.64]  Tom Arnold,
[11662.42 --> 11664.06]  emailed the other night,
[11664.50 --> 11669.34]  letting us know that Carpoon has finally launched.
[11669.34 --> 11670.82]  It's a,
[11670.82 --> 11671.92]  it's a parking,
[11672.20 --> 11674.22]  it's a parking violation,
[11675.18 --> 11676.94]  a car chomping,
[11677.62 --> 11678.86]  a harpooning,
[11679.04 --> 11679.44]  racing,
[11680.70 --> 11684.04]  a chaos simulation engine.
[11684.80 --> 11685.60]  We,
[11685.70 --> 11689.90]  we played it at the Whale Land at LTX when it was still in very,
[11690.10 --> 11690.92]  very much in,
[11691.02 --> 11692.08]  in early development.
[11692.50 --> 11693.56]  And he,
[11693.66 --> 11695.42]  he messaged the other day to say,
[11695.68 --> 11699.02]  it's now finally here.
[11699.02 --> 11699.80]  Carpoon.
[11701.04 --> 11701.64]  You're a,
[11701.64 --> 11703.96]  you're a tow truck with a harpoon and you,
[11704.18 --> 11705.74]  you collect the,
[11706.02 --> 11706.38]  you know,
[11706.52 --> 11706.74]  the,
[11706.80 --> 11708.90]  the things I actually haven't played it in quite a while.
[11709.28 --> 11709.80]  These,
[11709.92 --> 11710.30]  uh,
[11710.30 --> 11712.54]  molten meteors are new.
[11712.72 --> 11716.38]  So that seems like an exciting new mechanic for me to get to,
[11716.38 --> 11717.28]  get to try out.
[11717.32 --> 11717.52]  Anyway,
[11717.60 --> 11718.38]  it's finally up.
[11718.72 --> 11719.20]  Um,
[11719.20 --> 11723.46]  there is shared and split screen PVP and co-op.
[11723.50 --> 11726.06]  And I'm always a big fan of fun,
[11726.20 --> 11727.88]  new coach multiplayer games.
[11727.88 --> 11730.62]  And it's super affordable.
[11731.00 --> 11733.26]  It's like four us dollars.
[11733.50 --> 11735.54]  So basically if you want to try it out,
[11735.60 --> 11736.10]  um,
[11736.46 --> 11738.88]  the time that I've spent with it has been pretty fun.
[11738.88 --> 11739.60]  But like I said,
[11739.62 --> 11740.28]  it's been a while.
[11740.28 --> 11743.80]  I've been waiting for it to be finished and it just came out yesterday.
[11743.80 --> 11745.34]  So check it out.
[11745.48 --> 11746.72]  Carpoon on steam.
[11746.86 --> 11748.48]  Tom used to work with me at NCIX.
[11748.48 --> 11749.34]  He did the,
[11749.34 --> 11749.76]  uh,
[11750.02 --> 11752.08]  the silly like cartoon style,
[11752.08 --> 11752.82]  uh,
[11752.82 --> 11755.82]  banner imagery for our weekly sale among many,
[11755.86 --> 11756.02]  many,
[11756.10 --> 11756.92]  many other things.
[11757.00 --> 11757.80]  We worked together,
[11757.80 --> 11758.54]  uh,
[11758.54 --> 11764.64]  pretty closely actually on a number of projects that I just wouldn't have been able to bring to life without his,
[11765.20 --> 11765.62]  um,
[11765.62 --> 11767.20]  his humor and his,
[11767.30 --> 11768.10]  and his art style.
[11768.24 --> 11768.46]  So,
[11768.54 --> 11768.80]  um,
[11768.84 --> 11768.98]  yeah,
[11768.98 --> 11769.88]  super cool guy.
[11770.00 --> 11773.64]  So if you guys want to check out Carpoon now is as good a time as any.
[11773.70 --> 11773.80]  Oh,
[11773.84 --> 11774.80]  there's one user review.
[11775.18 --> 11775.86]  Look at this.
[11776.90 --> 11779.50]  User review already posted on the 8th of August,
[11779.62 --> 11781.06]  a pleasant solo or co-op game.
[11781.50 --> 11783.10]  Harpoon and reel mechanics are gratifying.
[11783.40 --> 11784.24]  Sound effects are rich.
[11784.66 --> 11786.50]  Soundtrack is catchy and fitting of the aesthetic.
[11786.98 --> 11787.92]  At the time of launch,
[11788.56 --> 11791.24]  a hundred percent of the game's achievement list is swift and fun to discover,
[11791.38 --> 11792.70]  which could make for a speed run challenge.
[11793.10 --> 11796.78]  The animations and circumstances these vehicles go through to be destroyed are delightfully hilarious.
[11797.14 --> 11802.42]  Could make for an all ages impromptu local remote experience within a competitive environment or as an icebreaker.
[11802.72 --> 11803.44]  There you go.
[11804.46 --> 11805.96]  Thanks cloud and collected.
[11807.48 --> 11808.20]  All right.
[11808.64 --> 11809.18]  Up next.
[11809.66 --> 11809.80]  Hey,
[11809.92 --> 11810.12]  DLO,
[11810.12 --> 11814.28]  what is the most flagrant example of corruption you've seen in Vancouver in Montreal?
[11814.28 --> 11821.72]  A developer offered me $10,000 cash to get help circulating a pro development petition with elections upcoming.
[11823.34 --> 11824.22]  Oh man.
[11824.38 --> 11824.88]  I don't know.
[11824.94 --> 11825.82]  There's so much.
[11826.36 --> 11826.64]  Um,
[11826.64 --> 11827.82]  Vancouver is money laundering.
[11828.24 --> 11829.50]  So it's going to be hard to see.
[11830.08 --> 11830.52]  Um,
[11830.96 --> 11831.16]  I,
[11831.40 --> 11832.08]  there's a lot of,
[11832.22 --> 11832.56]  yeah,
[11832.70 --> 11834.28]  a former employee here.
[11834.48 --> 11835.04]  Uh,
[11835.04 --> 11837.68]  I remember them telling me that a former,
[11837.68 --> 11838.76]  uh,
[11838.76 --> 11852.10]  provincial level politician used to walk into the shop that his mom worked at and very regularly buy copious amounts of designer goods in cash.
[11852.92 --> 11853.60]  Um,
[11853.60 --> 11853.62]  um,
[11853.62 --> 11856.04]  very regularly.
[11856.04 --> 11859.26]  I think that's about as brazen and,
[11859.26 --> 11860.38]  um,
[11861.28 --> 11866.14]  out in the open as corruption can be because why on earth would you have that kind of cash?
[11866.14 --> 11869.88]  Hey,
[11870.00 --> 11870.34]  DLO,
[11870.34 --> 11875.50]  what are your thoughts on wealth flexing YouTubers and their influence on kids?
[11875.72 --> 11881.20]  Do you worry kids will have an unrealistic expectation about money and how hard it is to get certain things?
[11881.20 --> 11882.32]  I gotta be honest with you.
[11882.32 --> 11886.34]  I sometimes worry about like wealthy influencers,
[11886.34 --> 11891.60]  own kids having unrealistic expectations about money and how hard it is to get certain things.
[11891.76 --> 11898.34]  We regularly will talk to our kids about how like mom and dad ran a successful company.
[11898.78 --> 11899.26]  Um,
[11899.26 --> 11906.44]  you aren't necessarily getting everything that we acquired as an inheritance.
[11906.94 --> 11911.92]  You need to have realistic expectations or you need to be ready to absolutely work your hiney off.
[11911.92 --> 11912.86]  If you want to,
[11912.86 --> 11915.06]  if you want to achieve,
[11915.06 --> 11915.58]  you know,
[11915.64 --> 11917.72]  the kind of success that you might want to achieve.
[11918.08 --> 11918.24]  Um,
[11918.60 --> 11924.28]  I don't let my kids watch like flexi YouTubers.
[11924.58 --> 11925.24]  They're not on TikTok.
[11925.56 --> 11926.32]  They're not on Instagram.
[11926.32 --> 11927.32]  Uh,
[11927.32 --> 11928.20]  they're not on Facebook.
[11929.08 --> 11929.60]  Um,
[11930.30 --> 11938.06]  and I do worry a lot that not just this generation,
[11938.06 --> 11941.76]  I think our generation got kind of up too,
[11941.84 --> 11943.38]  to be perfectly blunt with you.
[11943.42 --> 11943.70]  I mean,
[11944.32 --> 11944.78]  um,
[11945.02 --> 11945.42]  like I,
[11945.42 --> 11954.66]  I remember the first time somebody pointed out to me that none of the friends have jobs that could possibly sustain the gigantic apartments they live in in New York.
[11954.66 --> 11955.54]  And I was like,
[11955.60 --> 11955.88]  oh yeah,
[11956.32 --> 11958.98]  I guess that wouldn't make for like very good TV though.
[11959.68 --> 11962.42]  Little did they know that Bob's burgers could be a thing.
[11963.60 --> 11964.82]  A family about a,
[11964.82 --> 11969.58]  a show about a scrappy family that doesn't have a lot of money,
[11969.66 --> 11970.90]  just making things work.
[11971.58 --> 11972.02]  Um,
[11972.02 --> 11972.10]  um,
[11972.10 --> 11976.60]  yeah,
[11976.60 --> 11979.98]  I mean,
[11979.98 --> 11981.82]  I think Chandler was the only one though,
[11981.82 --> 11982.08]  right?
[11983.54 --> 11987.62]  Cause Chandler was weird because I think he was in like a Microsoft ad at one point in time.
[11988.34 --> 11988.78]  Um,
[11988.78 --> 11989.02]  no,
[11989.02 --> 11989.04]  no,
[11989.12 --> 11990.10]  that was just as an actor.
[11990.16 --> 11990.90]  Microsoft ad.
[11991.94 --> 11992.30]  No,
[11992.30 --> 11992.44]  no,
[11992.44 --> 11992.54]  no.
[11992.54 --> 11994.88]  I think there was a friends based Microsoft ad.
[11994.88 --> 11995.32]  Well,
[11995.44 --> 11996.58]  Jennifer Aniston and,
[11996.64 --> 11996.96]  uh,
[11996.96 --> 11998.68]  and Matthew Perry were in an ad,
[11998.74 --> 11999.10]  I think.
[12000.48 --> 12000.88]  No,
[12000.94 --> 12001.10]  like,
[12001.18 --> 12002.54]  I think it was friends based.
[12002.78 --> 12004.36]  I think it means like in the show.
[12004.54 --> 12004.80]  Oh,
[12004.92 --> 12005.20]  maybe.
[12005.84 --> 12006.02]  Yeah,
[12006.02 --> 12006.28]  maybe.
[12007.40 --> 12007.94]  So like,
[12007.94 --> 12008.82]  that could kind of make sense.
[12008.82 --> 12009.28]  But like,
[12009.36 --> 12011.72]  just because you work in TV doesn't mean you're rich.
[12011.72 --> 12012.34]  Like the,
[12012.40 --> 12012.80]  um,
[12013.14 --> 12014.34]  the King of the Hill reboot,
[12014.48 --> 12015.44]  the actor who played,
[12015.50 --> 12015.94]  um,
[12016.46 --> 12017.20]  John Redcorn,
[12017.78 --> 12018.02]  the,
[12018.08 --> 12020.50]  the father of Bobby Hill's best friend,
[12021.20 --> 12021.30]  the,
[12021.38 --> 12021.64]  like the,
[12021.64 --> 12022.58]  the biological father.
[12022.68 --> 12023.08]  He was,
[12023.16 --> 12024.08]  he was recently,
[12024.34 --> 12024.72]  um,
[12025.10 --> 12026.80]  tragically murdered actually,
[12026.80 --> 12027.30]  which,
[12027.46 --> 12027.80]  um,
[12028.12 --> 12029.06]  is a real downer.
[12029.20 --> 12031.12]  So he actually is in the reboot,
[12031.12 --> 12033.04]  but he won't live to see it air,
[12033.14 --> 12033.84]  uh,
[12033.84 --> 12034.66]  which is super sad.
[12035.10 --> 12035.50]  Um,
[12036.24 --> 12036.54]  anyway,
[12036.54 --> 12036.84]  I was,
[12036.92 --> 12038.76]  I was reading about it cause I saw the reboot,
[12038.82 --> 12039.20]  it was happening.
[12039.20 --> 12040.42]  And then I saw that he passed.
[12040.42 --> 12041.92]  And then I was looking around at the circumstances.
[12041.92 --> 12043.24]  He was like living in poverty.
[12044.14 --> 12045.80]  So just because you're like a,
[12045.92 --> 12046.16]  you know,
[12046.18 --> 12049.50]  a TV actor or a voice actor or whatever,
[12049.50 --> 12050.22]  like it's,
[12050.44 --> 12056.04]  you read tons of stories about people who even had like regular parts on major
[12056.04 --> 12056.46]  shows.
[12056.46 --> 12057.08]  Like what was it?
[12057.12 --> 12057.34]  The,
[12057.36 --> 12057.52]  uh,
[12057.52 --> 12059.78]  the comic book store owner in big bang theory,
[12059.78 --> 12061.60]  like had to have a day job,
[12061.60 --> 12064.72]  like very deep into the show's run or something like that.
[12064.78 --> 12065.12]  I don't,
[12065.20 --> 12066.14]  don't quote me on that one.
[12066.86 --> 12067.26]  Um,
[12067.26 --> 12075.36]  it's exactly why my aunt started pal to support like artists who were probably
[12075.36 --> 12077.80]  both very famous and also very poor.
[12078.98 --> 12079.46]  Yeah.
[12079.54 --> 12079.78]  Uh,
[12079.78 --> 12083.12]  Porto says part of Joey's plot was that he didn't have any money.
[12083.84 --> 12084.28]  Um,
[12084.50 --> 12084.86]  and then,
[12084.92 --> 12085.02]  yeah,
[12085.02 --> 12085.26]  the,
[12085.32 --> 12087.90]  the economics of Seinfeld are super,
[12087.90 --> 12089.06]  don't make any sense either.
[12089.06 --> 12089.82]  Like Jerry,
[12089.82 --> 12093.84]  I think as he becomes a very successful comedian in the show,
[12093.92 --> 12095.20]  he becomes successful later on,
[12095.22 --> 12095.46]  I think.
[12095.54 --> 12095.70]  Right.
[12096.02 --> 12096.92]  But like everyone else,
[12096.96 --> 12097.36]  what did they,
[12097.44 --> 12097.58]  like,
[12097.62 --> 12098.30]  what did they even do?
[12098.34 --> 12098.86]  How did they have it?
[12098.88 --> 12100.02]  How did Kramer have money?
[12102.86 --> 12103.20]  Um,
[12103.46 --> 12105.74]  the loss that says people confuse fame with wealth.
[12105.84 --> 12106.04]  Yeah.
[12106.52 --> 12107.12]  A hundred percent.
[12109.92 --> 12110.92]  I got to show you this.
[12110.98 --> 12111.16]  So I,
[12111.16 --> 12113.44]  I looked up the thing that I was talking about and I was,
[12113.54 --> 12114.46]  I was wrong.
[12114.46 --> 12115.54]  Um,
[12115.54 --> 12121.22]  it was a windows 95 video guide featuring Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry.
[12121.36 --> 12121.52]  Yeah.
[12121.74 --> 12121.94]  Oh,
[12122.00 --> 12122.14]  okay.
[12122.14 --> 12123.00]  So it was what I said then.
[12123.00 --> 12123.28]  Um,
[12124.18 --> 12124.40]  yeah.
[12124.70 --> 12124.90]  Yeah.
[12124.90 --> 12125.16]  Okay.
[12125.40 --> 12127.36]  Then I want to show you this.
[12127.42 --> 12129.32]  I'm going to send it to Dan so you can put it up on screen.
[12129.32 --> 12129.52]  Sure.
[12129.84 --> 12133.38]  Look at this actually insane ad that I just got on YouTube.
[12134.04 --> 12134.60]  Uh oh.
[12134.60 --> 12134.68]  Uh,
[12134.68 --> 12135.60]  uh,
[12135.60 --> 12136.60]  uh,
[12136.60 --> 12137.98]  uh,
[12137.98 --> 12140.10]  I,
[12140.10 --> 12141.42]  I screenshot the whole thing,
[12141.42 --> 12144.44]  but it's the one on the right.
[12144.46 --> 12146.78]  above the Ted talk with Linus Torvalds.
[12150.54 --> 12151.54]  The one on the right.
[12152.40 --> 12153.46]  Let me know when you can see it.
[12154.56 --> 12155.56]  Cling AI.
[12156.58 --> 12158.92]  Unlocking AI's infinite possibilities.
[12160.00 --> 12160.80]  So we have.
[12160.96 --> 12161.94]  Look at what they're suggesting.
[12162.04 --> 12162.72]  Two people.
[12162.98 --> 12164.12]  And so we want to ship them.
[12165.94 --> 12166.60]  But like,
[12166.68 --> 12167.68]  think about how that would.
[12167.68 --> 12168.00]  Why?
[12169.70 --> 12171.00]  Why do we need to do this?
[12171.00 --> 12174.44]  Like this is saying like you have a picture of yourself and you have a picture of like some girl or some
[12174.44 --> 12175.16]  boy or whatever.
[12175.40 --> 12175.68]  Yep.
[12175.88 --> 12179.64]  And you can turn that into a video of them making out.
[12180.52 --> 12180.82]  Yeah.
[12182.46 --> 12184.76]  This generation is like screwed.
[12185.56 --> 12186.88]  Because think about,
[12187.00 --> 12188.34]  think about being in high school.
[12188.50 --> 12190.58]  Like do you remember when we were in high school?
[12190.82 --> 12192.72]  How quickly like this,
[12192.90 --> 12197.62]  this guy made out with this girl would spread like wildfire without a video.
[12197.62 --> 12198.88]  Yeah.
[12201.40 --> 12201.80]  Yeah.
[12203.28 --> 12204.24]  It's also just like,
[12204.32 --> 12204.78]  you know,
[12204.88 --> 12205.42]  you know,
[12205.42 --> 12207.84]  this is going to happen to celebrities.
[12208.10 --> 12208.34]  Oh yeah.
[12208.40 --> 12209.98]  There'll be weird fanfic stuff.
[12210.92 --> 12211.32]  Yep.
[12212.32 --> 12212.88]  Or fan,
[12212.98 --> 12214.14]  fan video fic.
[12214.60 --> 12214.80]  Like.
[12214.80 --> 12220.94]  That is a,
[12221.24 --> 12221.40]  that,
[12221.54 --> 12223.56]  and that ad is being served by YouTube.
[12226.08 --> 12227.22]  Can we not?
[12231.32 --> 12232.54]  Speaking of YouTube.
[12232.94 --> 12233.20]  Um,
[12233.20 --> 12233.54]  hold on.
[12233.56 --> 12233.68]  No,
[12233.68 --> 12233.94]  I'm not,
[12234.08 --> 12234.82]  I'm not done yet.
[12234.90 --> 12235.24]  Okay.
[12235.24 --> 12235.66]  Um,
[12236.02 --> 12236.86]  we will dwell.
[12237.10 --> 12237.26]  No,
[12237.36 --> 12237.86]  I do.
[12238.86 --> 12239.34]  I,
[12239.66 --> 12240.14]  yes.
[12240.14 --> 12244.36]  whether it's real or not real and,
[12244.50 --> 12250.26]  and the blurred lines that are now existing between like the real influencer lifestyles and the fake ones.
[12250.70 --> 12251.22]  Um,
[12251.26 --> 12251.40]  it,
[12251.48 --> 12251.88]  or it's rather,
[12251.92 --> 12254.00]  it's becoming easier to blur those lines.
[12254.00 --> 12255.02]  Like think about the,
[12255.08 --> 12256.68]  like the super famous examples of this,
[12256.72 --> 12257.30]  like Tai Lopez.
[12258.12 --> 12258.60]  Right.
[12259.02 --> 12259.46]  With his,
[12259.58 --> 12261.28]  with his garage full of knowledge.
[12261.62 --> 12262.10]  Right.
[12262.26 --> 12262.48]  Yeah.
[12262.86 --> 12266.34]  How much easier it's going to be to,
[12266.34 --> 12270.06]  to be a Jones that other people are going to,
[12270.06 --> 12277.36]  aspire to keep up with and that other people are going to compare themselves to and look at their own lives and try to figure out,
[12277.40 --> 12277.68]  you know,
[12278.12 --> 12279.38]  why it is that they're,
[12279.50 --> 12280.78]  that they're not able to,
[12280.78 --> 12281.82]  to live that lifestyle.
[12281.98 --> 12282.08]  I mean,
[12282.12 --> 12286.86]  the reality of it is that very few people drive a Lamborghini.
[12287.20 --> 12287.44]  Like,
[12287.48 --> 12292.86]  I don't remember the last time I saw one on the road because I don't live in like Dubai.
[12293.90 --> 12294.34]  Like,
[12294.34 --> 12297.16]  can you remember the last time you saw a Lambo on the road in Langley?
[12297.72 --> 12298.40]  I don't.
[12298.40 --> 12299.28]  It happens,
[12299.44 --> 12302.32]  but it also feels like they're like passing through.
[12302.48 --> 12303.32]  Or honestly,
[12303.32 --> 12304.46]  if I see one in Langley,
[12304.50 --> 12305.56]  I assume you rented it.
[12305.82 --> 12312.42]  But like so much of what you see exactly is like rented or borrowed or,
[12312.42 --> 12314.04]  I mean,
[12314.10 --> 12315.42]  now AI generated.
[12315.62 --> 12316.16]  Like I just,
[12316.16 --> 12319.14]  yeah,
[12319.14 --> 12322.78]  I worry that just like our generation was set up for disappointment.
[12322.78 --> 12327.08]  I worry the next generation is going to be set up for even more disappointment.
[12328.08 --> 12328.40]  Um,
[12328.40 --> 12329.12]  and I had,
[12329.24 --> 12330.10]  I had some people in,
[12330.52 --> 12331.14]  Oh,
[12331.14 --> 12331.36]  go ahead.
[12331.46 --> 12332.40]  Not just in lifestyle,
[12332.40 --> 12334.16]  but also in,
[12334.26 --> 12334.72]  um,
[12335.42 --> 12336.98]  in like with the lifestyle you can afford,
[12337.08 --> 12344.10]  but also the lifestyle you will have socially because of the interactions you'll have with AI are not going to line up with the interactions you have with people.
[12344.10 --> 12344.54]  Yeah.
[12344.54 --> 12344.82]  Yeah.
[12344.82 --> 12348.06]  I had some people chatting with,
[12348.06 --> 12348.42]  uh,
[12348.42 --> 12349.24]  chatting in the,
[12349.30 --> 12351.62]  in the chat about like chatting in the chat.
[12351.68 --> 12352.40]  Imagine them doing that.
[12352.62 --> 12354.56]  I had some people in the chat talking about like,
[12354.58 --> 12354.76]  you know,
[12354.78 --> 12356.42]  how am I contributing to this?
[12356.44 --> 12357.64]  And I got to be honest with you guys.
[12357.70 --> 12358.04]  I,
[12358.20 --> 12358.52]  um,
[12358.52 --> 12367.34]  I don't think that my lifestyle is super like realistic at this point.
[12367.96 --> 12368.36]  Um,
[12368.56 --> 12373.40]  I don't know what you want me to do about it though.
[12373.40 --> 12377.42]  Cause either I don't talk about it at all,
[12377.42 --> 12378.50]  which I don't,
[12378.62 --> 12381.72]  I don't think you guys want me to like not talk about my tech projects anymore.
[12381.72 --> 12384.00]  I don't think so.
[12385.20 --> 12386.52]  Or like I fake it.
[12386.80 --> 12387.62]  Like I don't,
[12388.34 --> 12390.44]  yeah,
[12390.48 --> 12390.74]  I don't know.
[12390.78 --> 12391.62]  I don't know what to tell you.
[12397.46 --> 12398.22]  Like one of the,
[12398.26 --> 12398.56]  one of the,
[12398.56 --> 12402.06]  one of the things I want to do soon is set up the theater room,
[12402.06 --> 12402.82]  um,
[12402.90 --> 12407.42]  for better voice comms for mixed in-person couch and remote couch gaming.
[12407.42 --> 12410.56]  I don't think that's a relatable problem,
[12410.56 --> 12415.64]  but we're going to end up using some fun tools that people could have their own uses for.
[12416.66 --> 12417.06]  Um,
[12417.28 --> 12420.76]  it's going to be a really cool payoff where we can have like 10 gamers,
[12420.88 --> 12426.66]  some of which are in person and some of which are remoted in all participating in like couch gaming together.
[12427.36 --> 12428.14]  Like it's,
[12428.64 --> 12428.92]  it's,
[12429.06 --> 12430.22]  it's going to be cool,
[12430.22 --> 12431.26]  but like,
[12431.30 --> 12431.44]  yeah,
[12431.48 --> 12431.66]  no,
[12431.70 --> 12432.14]  it's not,
[12432.22 --> 12433.62]  it's not relatable at all.
[12436.00 --> 12436.40]  Um,
[12436.40 --> 12443.44]  yeah.
[12443.92 --> 12444.36]  Sorry.
[12444.40 --> 12444.72]  One second.
[12444.80 --> 12445.90]  I'm having a problem on my end.
[12446.10 --> 12446.50]  Okay.
[12447.40 --> 12448.90]  That explains it.
[12453.12 --> 12453.56]  Just,
[12453.66 --> 12455.54]  just keep doing your stupid house tours.
[12458.54 --> 12458.98]  Uh,
[12458.98 --> 12462.98]  yeah.
[12464.22 --> 12464.74]  So yeah,
[12464.82 --> 12465.22]  Hathos,
[12465.22 --> 12466.04]  I guess I,
[12466.20 --> 12470.48]  maybe that's the balance is not showing off luxury for the sake of it.
[12471.48 --> 12471.92]  Um,
[12471.96 --> 12472.24]  I mean,
[12472.24 --> 12472.64]  one of the,
[12472.70 --> 12480.14]  one of the big things for me that I think is so cool about technology is that the 115 inch TV that,
[12480.26 --> 12480.80]  you know,
[12480.98 --> 12482.34]  I'm unboxing today,
[12483.34 --> 12484.34]  give it five years,
[12484.54 --> 12485.28]  maybe 10 years,
[12485.36 --> 12486.50]  maybe it'll be a long time,
[12486.50 --> 12488.44]  but give it some period of time.
[12488.76 --> 12490.92]  And that will make its way eventually.
[12491.28 --> 12494.08]  If the trajectories continue to hold at least,
[12494.30 --> 12494.66]  you know,
[12494.72 --> 12495.28]  kind of,
[12495.42 --> 12497.42]  it will be attainable.
[12497.72 --> 12498.08]  Right.
[12498.92 --> 12499.32]  Um,
[12499.32 --> 12502.28]  that's something that I think is,
[12502.32 --> 12503.02]  is really cool.
[12503.10 --> 12503.60]  It's just been,
[12503.74 --> 12505.24]  it's been hard to watch it be less true.
[12505.24 --> 12508.54]  Like it used to be that I could make a video about a cutting edge GPU.
[12508.54 --> 12510.30]  And like in a few years,
[12510.76 --> 12511.94]  you know,
[12511.98 --> 12512.18]  any,
[12512.32 --> 12514.46]  just about anyone could get their hands on one,
[12514.56 --> 12514.82]  you know,
[12514.84 --> 12515.80]  secondhand or whatever,
[12515.80 --> 12517.24]  or the new generation,
[12517.40 --> 12517.58]  you know,
[12517.64 --> 12520.48]  mainstream would be on par with the old top of the line one.
[12520.56 --> 12520.86]  Just,
[12521.80 --> 12521.98]  Oh,
[12521.98 --> 12523.66]  are we dead?
[12524.50 --> 12524.94]  Checking.
[12524.94 --> 12529.10]  wrong button Luke.
[12529.20 --> 12529.58]  They said,
[12529.58 --> 12538.24]  there was a cloud flare blip earlier,
[12538.38 --> 12539.44]  but it was a long time ago.
[12542.10 --> 12543.44]  It's apparently going in and out.
[12544.82 --> 12545.40]  All right.
[12545.46 --> 12545.66]  Sick.
[12552.22 --> 12552.66]  Back.
[12553.00 --> 12553.60]  New F.
[12554.28 --> 12554.58]  Okay.
[12555.36 --> 12556.70]  Let's do our next merch message.
[12558.96 --> 12559.60]  Sure thing.
[12560.24 --> 12560.66]  Good evening,
[12560.76 --> 12561.00]  gentlemen,
[12561.16 --> 12561.34]  Luke,
[12561.38 --> 12563.34]  have you seen Paco the parrot on YouTube?
[12564.46 --> 12567.80]  I believe this is the one that likes the LTT screwdriver.
[12568.06 --> 12568.68]  Is that right?
[12568.88 --> 12569.88]  Or is that a different parrot?
[12570.76 --> 12572.90]  There's many parrots that like our screwdriver.
[12574.28 --> 12574.68]  No,
[12574.80 --> 12576.16]  there's just many parrots on YouTube.
[12578.46 --> 12578.90]  Nope.
[12579.10 --> 12580.04]  I think it's a different,
[12580.22 --> 12580.56]  Oh wait,
[12580.66 --> 12580.82]  no,
[12580.92 --> 12581.36]  I can't,
[12581.36 --> 12582.66]  I can't find the one that,
[12582.66 --> 12583.10]  uh,
[12583.10 --> 12585.00]  that likes the LTT screwdriver.
[12585.44 --> 12586.18]  Oh crap.
[12586.78 --> 12587.22]  Uh-oh.
[12589.22 --> 12590.36]  Build a PC.
[12590.74 --> 12591.30]  Hold on.
[12592.02 --> 12592.38]  Is it,
[12592.64 --> 12593.40]  which one's that?
[12593.64 --> 12594.00]  Okay.
[12594.08 --> 12594.90]  I swear.
[12595.30 --> 12596.00]  I swear.
[12596.10 --> 12596.58]  There's like,
[12596.58 --> 12597.96]  I don't think this is the one.
[12598.04 --> 12599.08]  There's a famous parrot.
[12599.08 --> 12599.68]  I know the one you're talking about.
[12599.76 --> 12600.06]  Okay.
[12600.26 --> 12600.42]  Yeah.
[12600.50 --> 12601.44]  I'm not imagining this.
[12601.56 --> 12602.14]  Where is it?
[12602.26 --> 12602.40]  No,
[12602.44 --> 12602.70]  you're not.
[12603.00 --> 12604.68]  I don't remember the name of that one.
[12604.76 --> 12608.90]  There's a famous parrot that like used our screwdriver or something.
[12610.04 --> 12610.44]  Apollo.
[12611.10 --> 12611.64]  That's right.
[12611.66 --> 12612.08]  It's Apollo.
[12612.36 --> 12612.72]  Okay.
[12612.72 --> 12613.02]  No,
[12613.12 --> 12614.40]  I don't know Paco the parrot.
[12614.50 --> 12615.12]  I know Apollo.
[12616.38 --> 12616.54]  Yeah.
[12616.62 --> 12616.80]  Okay.
[12616.80 --> 12617.08]  Do you,
[12617.14 --> 12618.14]  do you know Paco the parrot?
[12619.40 --> 12619.68]  Uh,
[12619.70 --> 12619.86]  yep.
[12620.38 --> 12621.14]  Is it okay?
[12621.30 --> 12622.46]  If there is content,
[12622.82 --> 12625.90]  good parrot has probably found it and shared it with me at some time.
[12626.02 --> 12626.36]  Okay.
[12626.42 --> 12627.86]  Is Paco a quality parrot?
[12628.26 --> 12628.60]  Like,
[12628.60 --> 12629.64]  uh,
[12629.64 --> 12631.88]  I believe if we're talking about the same Paco,
[12631.98 --> 12633.04]  Paco was a,
[12633.04 --> 12636.06]  was a rescue or is.
[12636.16 --> 12636.46]  Yeah.
[12636.82 --> 12637.30]  Okay.
[12637.30 --> 12639.44]  A rescue and like beat correction and,
[12639.44 --> 12643.76]  and medical stuff thing,
[12643.82 --> 12644.34]  which is cool.
[12644.72 --> 12645.22]  Oh yeah.
[12645.22 --> 12645.52]  Wow.
[12645.56 --> 12646.00]  Look at this.
[12646.08 --> 12647.26]  Look at this beak boys.
[12647.96 --> 12648.44]  Yeah.
[12648.56 --> 12649.22]  Whoopsie doodles.
[12651.58 --> 12652.02]  Okay.
[12652.12 --> 12652.46]  Guys,
[12652.56 --> 12653.50]  stop just posting.
[12653.74 --> 12653.80]  Like,
[12655.34 --> 12657.74]  okay.
[12658.22 --> 12658.58]  Uh,
[12658.60 --> 12660.18]  why did you curate this Dan?
[12662.28 --> 12662.84]  Which one?
[12662.88 --> 12663.34]  The next one?
[12664.42 --> 12664.62]  Uh,
[12664.62 --> 12664.88]  no,
[12665.00 --> 12665.82]  the parrot one.
[12666.68 --> 12667.98]  Cause it was a question for Luke.
[12668.20 --> 12668.46]  Oh,
[12668.58 --> 12668.92]  okay.
[12669.64 --> 12670.66]  Should I not do that?
[12670.72 --> 12670.88]  No,
[12670.92 --> 12671.02]  no,
[12671.02 --> 12671.44]  you do whatever.
[12672.64 --> 12673.04]  Oops.
[12673.12 --> 12673.66]  I'm sorry.
[12674.24 --> 12674.52]  Hi,
[12674.64 --> 12675.44]  LLND,
[12675.72 --> 12681.36]  back into the Hacksmith EDC knife and wondered how it feels to have your bits be considered in their design.
[12681.60 --> 12685.10]  Are you aware of other products that have considered LTT in their design?
[12685.34 --> 12686.70]  I'm not aware of any others,
[12686.70 --> 12688.44]  but I'm also not aware of too many,
[12688.44 --> 12690.14]  other creators that we,
[12690.14 --> 12691.86]  we vibe with as,
[12691.96 --> 12692.86]  as tight as,
[12692.86 --> 12693.62]  uh,
[12693.62 --> 12695.50]  James over at the Hacksmith.
[12695.74 --> 12696.18]  Um,
[12697.10 --> 12698.22]  super cool guy.
[12698.22 --> 12700.66]  And this looks like an absolutely incredible product.
[12700.66 --> 12701.12]  He's,
[12701.16 --> 12701.74]  he's been,
[12702.22 --> 12706.76]  he's been in my DMS throughout the development of this thing,
[12706.76 --> 12710.18]  showing me some of the absolutely incredible work that they've done.
[12710.18 --> 12713.02]  I think it just went live on Kickstarter,
[12713.02 --> 12716.44]  like a few days ago or something like that.
[12716.98 --> 12717.42]  Um,
[12717.72 --> 12719.64]  this is a great time.
[12719.64 --> 12720.12]  If,
[12720.22 --> 12721.98]  if there was someone who's Kickstarter,
[12721.98 --> 12723.58]  I would be willing to promote.
[12723.70 --> 12724.86]  It would be Hacksmith.
[12725.06 --> 12727.32]  They will absolutely deliver this.
[12727.32 --> 12727.88]  If they're,
[12727.98 --> 12733.08]  if their history is anything to go by and it looks freaking incredible.
[12733.08 --> 12734.30]  Um,
[12734.60 --> 12735.16]  just,
[12735.54 --> 12736.68]  just built.
[12737.70 --> 12738.26]  Absolutely.
[12738.58 --> 12739.98]  Here's a question for you.
[12740.82 --> 12741.42]  Why,
[12741.56 --> 12742.36]  why Kickstarter?
[12743.00 --> 12743.48]  I don't know.
[12744.18 --> 12746.74]  I legitimately don't know.
[12746.84 --> 12747.46]  I think,
[12747.78 --> 12752.08]  I think Kickstarter does offer 100% deals to,
[12752.92 --> 12753.28]  um,
[12753.98 --> 12755.30]  maybe not a hundred percent,
[12755.30 --> 12758.02]  but they offer extremely high revenue share deals.
[12758.02 --> 12758.96]  From my understanding,
[12759.10 --> 12759.20]  I,
[12759.34 --> 12760.20]  this is all hearsay.
[12760.30 --> 12760.48]  I,
[12760.58 --> 12762.44]  I have had no dealings with Kickstarter whatsoever.
[12763.02 --> 12765.32]  James hasn't talked to me about why Kickstarter at all.
[12765.40 --> 12766.20]  I was going to ask him.
[12766.24 --> 12766.82]  I haven't yet.
[12766.90 --> 12767.64]  I don't know anything.
[12767.88 --> 12770.38]  I'm coming from a place of complete ignorance.
[12773.54 --> 12774.66]  Luke also doesn't know.
[12775.48 --> 12775.88]  Um,
[12775.88 --> 12776.46]  I have no idea.
[12776.66 --> 12780.62]  So my understanding is that for marketing for Kickstarter,
[12780.62 --> 12781.46]  the platform,
[12781.62 --> 12785.62]  they will offer better revenue shares to products that,
[12785.62 --> 12786.62]  um,
[12786.62 --> 12789.54]  can get the word out more about Kickstarter,
[12789.68 --> 12792.76]  where there's a mutual marketing benefit for the platform itself.
[12793.06 --> 12794.62]  And then they also,
[12795.20 --> 12797.04]  Kickstarter is a powerful tool.
[12797.56 --> 12798.72]  We've never used it,
[12798.74 --> 12801.00]  but there have been times that I've been tempted just to,
[12801.42 --> 12805.38]  just in many cases to figure out like what the market is for our product.
[12805.38 --> 12806.02]  So you just like,
[12806.02 --> 12807.78]  don't bother making it if not enough people,
[12807.98 --> 12808.60]  uh,
[12808.60 --> 12809.90]  if not enough people back it,
[12809.90 --> 12811.24]  and then you just refund the money and you're like,
[12811.26 --> 12811.44]  okay,
[12811.44 --> 12811.60]  well,
[12811.60 --> 12814.66]  I'm glad we found that out before we invested in a bunch of molds and tooling.
[12815.14 --> 12815.54]  Right.
[12815.86 --> 12816.22]  Um,
[12816.22 --> 12816.98]  yeah.
[12817.10 --> 12820.46]  So I would guess just that they're helping amplify it and he's,
[12820.58 --> 12820.86]  uh,
[12820.86 --> 12823.58]  and they're getting some benefit from the association with tax myth.
[12823.72 --> 12823.84]  And,
[12823.84 --> 12824.86]  um,
[12826.10 --> 12826.36]  I,
[12826.58 --> 12827.90]  it wouldn't be for me to share,
[12828.02 --> 12832.12]  but I think he's doing pretty good on the project so far.
[12832.48 --> 12832.92]  So,
[12833.00 --> 12833.42]  um,
[12833.96 --> 12834.20]  well,
[12834.26 --> 12834.52]  I mean,
[12834.52 --> 12837.56]  you can see on Kickstarter that it's raised four and a half million.
[12837.56 --> 12838.00]  Oh yeah.
[12838.06 --> 12838.36]  They're okay.
[12838.42 --> 12839.00]  It's public then.
[12839.08 --> 12839.28]  Cool.
[12839.68 --> 12839.94]  Yep.
[12840.02 --> 12840.20]  Yeah.
[12840.38 --> 12840.72]  So I think,
[12840.80 --> 12841.74]  I think he's doing pretty good.
[12841.92 --> 12842.10]  Yep.
[12842.10 --> 12843.16]  Yeah.
[12843.16 --> 12844.12]  He's doing okay.
[12844.42 --> 12844.64]  Yeah.
[12844.64 --> 12845.92]  I guess I'm in America right now.
[12845.98 --> 12847.00]  So mine's showing USD.
[12847.30 --> 12847.54]  Yep.
[12847.92 --> 12848.34]  And,
[12848.42 --> 12848.70]  uh,
[12848.76 --> 12848.94]  and,
[12848.94 --> 12849.54]  and look,
[12849.66 --> 12850.48]  look at it go.
[12851.06 --> 12851.28]  So,
[12851.28 --> 12851.56]  uh,
[12851.56 --> 12851.70]  yeah.
[12851.86 --> 12852.96]  That makes sense.
[12852.96 --> 12854.30]  That's why the pledge goal is so weird.
[12854.50 --> 12857.82]  The pledge goal was $181,957.
[12858.22 --> 12858.54]  And I was like,
[12858.54 --> 12859.00]  what the heck?
[12859.06 --> 12860.24]  And it's because Hacksmith's Canadian.
[12861.00 --> 12862.34]  You better believe it,
[12862.38 --> 12862.60]  buddy.
[12863.84 --> 12864.88]  I'm not your buddy,
[12864.96 --> 12865.12]  friend.
[12867.12 --> 12868.24]  I honestly,
[12868.46 --> 12869.54]  this might be,
[12869.54 --> 12870.60]  uh,
[12871.14 --> 12871.78]  a weird take.
[12871.82 --> 12872.22]  I don't know.
[12872.40 --> 12873.60]  I am interested in this.
[12873.88 --> 12877.18]  I would wait for it to not be on Kickstarter anymore.
[12877.72 --> 12880.40]  And like for myself,
[12880.40 --> 12882.06]  because I might look into getting one of these.
[12882.06 --> 12882.90]  Um,
[12883.30 --> 12884.28]  I would wait for it to not be,
[12884.36 --> 12886.40]  I'm going to wait for it to not be on Kickstarter anymore.
[12886.46 --> 12889.34]  And my reason for it is just because I don't want to deal with the,
[12889.56 --> 12889.66]  like,
[12890.38 --> 12898.22]  like one of my problems with Kickstarter forever is you have to interact on
[12898.22 --> 12899.98]  Kickstarter to get your thing.
[12900.58 --> 12900.70]  Right.
[12901.88 --> 12902.32]  Um,
[12902.42 --> 12902.80]  so like,
[12902.80 --> 12906.80]  I'm going to have to come back to Kickstarter at some point to get it.
[12907.64 --> 12910.12]  And I might just like not do that.
[12912.06 --> 12914.68]  You can just tell us you're traumatized by the cold bar.
[12914.80 --> 12915.68]  Like you could just say that.
[12915.82 --> 12916.04]  I am.
[12916.30 --> 12917.18]  You could just say that.
[12917.76 --> 12918.78]  It doesn't update it.
[12918.78 --> 12920.46]  You don't have to say so many words.
[12920.52 --> 12921.28]  You could just say,
[12921.36 --> 12924.10]  because I'm traumatized from the cold bar.
[12924.88 --> 12925.88]  I will go look here.
[12925.88 --> 12927.52]  I'm going to go look one last time.
[12927.62 --> 12928.00]  Oh no.
[12928.00 --> 12928.32]  Um,
[12929.00 --> 12929.72]  there's no way.
[12929.88 --> 12931.06]  There's no way there's an update,
[12931.20 --> 12931.28]  sir.
[12933.76 --> 12934.94]  There's absolutely no way.
[12935.76 --> 12936.44]  I agree,
[12936.58 --> 12937.94]  but I'm going to go just for the people.
[12937.94 --> 12942.54]  Cause they asked me all the time and it's been well over a year.
[12942.66 --> 12943.04]  I think,
[12943.16 --> 12944.46]  I think it's been a long time.
[12945.10 --> 12945.92]  So this is,
[12946.04 --> 12946.76]  this is the,
[12946.96 --> 12948.10]  this is the last one.
[12948.16 --> 12949.02]  If there's no update,
[12949.08 --> 12950.00]  we're never looking again.
[12950.60 --> 12951.00]  Um,
[12951.48 --> 12954.60]  all right.
[12954.68 --> 12955.28]  We're logging in.
[12955.64 --> 12956.38]  Oh my God.
[12956.50 --> 12956.78]  Okay.
[12956.78 --> 12957.04]  Dan,
[12957.10 --> 12958.58]  do you want to do a merch message in the meantime then?
[12958.78 --> 12958.88]  Sure.
[12959.68 --> 12960.28]  Sending this.
[12960.28 --> 12960.50]  Oh no,
[12960.54 --> 12961.42]  like I'm logged in now.
[12961.56 --> 12961.88]  Oh,
[12961.98 --> 12962.30]  okay.
[12962.40 --> 12962.88]  All right.
[12962.98 --> 12963.30]  All right.
[12965.62 --> 12966.40]  Cause I did,
[12966.66 --> 12967.10]  um,
[12967.92 --> 12968.32]  okay.
[12968.32 --> 12970.40]  I got to scroll and find it.
[12972.76 --> 12975.28]  Scroll past all these unsuccessful projects.
[12977.20 --> 12977.76]  Okay.
[12977.86 --> 12978.72]  Here it is.
[12979.52 --> 12981.04]  Cold bar hammer updates.
[12982.82 --> 12983.34]  2022.
[12984.06 --> 12984.46]  Yeah.
[12985.22 --> 12986.06]  Never happened.
[12986.14 --> 12986.38]  I'm sorry,
[12986.44 --> 12986.64]  buddy.
[12987.92 --> 12988.28]  Okay.
[12988.44 --> 12989.00]  Dan hit me.
[12989.52 --> 12990.74]  Sending this from a plane.
[12991.12 --> 12992.66]  Love the WAN backpack.
[12993.12 --> 12994.70]  More than worth its price.
[12994.78 --> 12994.98]  Nice.
[12994.98 --> 12996.04]  When designing the backpack,
[12996.20 --> 12998.04]  what made you go with the internal bottle holder?
[12998.04 --> 12999.06]  I was skeptical at first,
[12999.14 --> 13000.24]  but it works great.
[13000.56 --> 13000.94]  Um,
[13001.24 --> 13005.88]  I had lost water bottles before having an external holder.
[13007.74 --> 13008.22]  Basically.
[13009.52 --> 13010.00]  I,
[13010.10 --> 13010.42]  I,
[13010.42 --> 13015.40]  I used my backpack for travel a lot and wanted to continue to use it for travel.
[13015.56 --> 13016.94]  And as you probably noticed,
[13016.94 --> 13018.72]  if you really stuff it,
[13019.34 --> 13019.44]  the,
[13019.60 --> 13020.08]  the,
[13020.08 --> 13024.86]  the OG backpack is exactly the size that'll like fit under the chair in front of you on most flights.
[13024.86 --> 13027.22]  Although things have gotten smaller since we released it.
[13027.22 --> 13028.20]  Um,
[13029.04 --> 13030.18]  and I wanted some flights.
[13030.26 --> 13030.92]  It doesn't work for.
[13031.10 --> 13031.34]  Yeah.
[13031.34 --> 13037.38]  There's a handful of like small regional airlines that have planes seats that are so low profile that it's hard to get it under.
[13037.92 --> 13038.32]  Um,
[13038.38 --> 13038.62]  wow.
[13038.62 --> 13048.22]  And so I wanted something that was self-contained and nothing could fall out of and everything zipped up and could be stuffed under somewhere and nothing would fall out down there.
[13048.22 --> 13051.06]  And then you have to like bend down under the seat and try and dig stuff out.
[13051.30 --> 13051.74]  Um,
[13051.74 --> 13052.66]  that was the original,
[13053.32 --> 13054.68]  that was the original goal.
[13054.84 --> 13056.30]  And then also if you like,
[13056.36 --> 13057.36]  didn't want to use that,
[13057.42 --> 13060.48]  it would just kind of tuck out of the way and you could just stuff it full of stuff.
[13060.90 --> 13061.16]  Um,
[13061.16 --> 13066.82]  we got so much feedback that people liked exterior water bottle holders that we did do an exterior bottle holder on the commuter.
[13067.20 --> 13067.56]  Um,
[13067.56 --> 13068.22]  but that's again,
[13068.70 --> 13068.96]  you know,
[13068.96 --> 13070.62]  a product that has a very different intent.
[13070.62 --> 13071.76]  It's more of like a,
[13071.76 --> 13073.68]  like a day to day commuter.
[13073.68 --> 13078.46]  It's not for like tucking into places and not wanting to worry about things falling out of it.
[13079.22 --> 13082.42]  Where in the world did you get this many e-waste CPUs?
[13082.52 --> 13084.96]  Any other recycled products that you can tease?
[13084.96 --> 13085.44]  Uh,
[13085.48 --> 13086.96]  we actually have to buy them,
[13087.32 --> 13089.06]  which is,
[13089.44 --> 13090.40]  I mean,
[13091.04 --> 13091.56]  you know,
[13091.60 --> 13094.04]  people use them to recover the minerals,
[13094.16 --> 13094.24]  right?
[13094.30 --> 13096.48]  So that's part of why it's so expensive.
[13096.48 --> 13097.66]  The good news though,
[13097.66 --> 13102.18]  is none of this prevents anybody in the future from harvesting the gold from it.
[13102.28 --> 13109.02]  We're just temporarily turning it from garbage into a toy for a while.
[13109.28 --> 13109.84]  You know,
[13109.86 --> 13110.88]  that's the most we can,
[13111.04 --> 13112.82]  that's the most we can really do.
[13113.04 --> 13113.42]  You know,
[13113.42 --> 13116.42]  I think that's the goal for all of us.
[13117.74 --> 13117.92]  Hmm.
[13118.12 --> 13118.30]  Hmm.
[13118.48 --> 13118.62]  Hmm.
[13118.80 --> 13119.28]  Pankrats.
[13119.96 --> 13120.32]  Yeah.
[13120.50 --> 13121.98]  Turning it into a toy.
[13122.06 --> 13122.32]  Get it?
[13122.40 --> 13122.56]  Yeah.
[13122.64 --> 13122.90]  Thanks.
[13122.96 --> 13123.30]  Pankrats.
[13124.04 --> 13125.74]  Love all you guys at Linus.
[13125.82 --> 13129.74]  How do you go about teaching other parents about online safety and parental controls?
[13130.20 --> 13130.70]  I don't.
[13132.58 --> 13133.02]  Dude,
[13133.10 --> 13134.60]  I ain't nobody got time for that.
[13135.40 --> 13136.24]  Have you ever tried to?
[13136.46 --> 13136.74]  Okay.
[13136.96 --> 13137.22]  Okay.
[13137.26 --> 13137.82]  First of all,
[13137.94 --> 13138.58]  first of all.
[13138.70 --> 13138.86]  Okay.
[13139.54 --> 13140.28]  First of all.
[13140.28 --> 13148.08]  Have you ever met another parent who wants to be told how to parent?
[13150.48 --> 13152.34]  Even when they ask for advice,
[13152.68 --> 13155.50]  have you ever met anyone who really wanted to hear it?
[13155.50 --> 13157.86]  All right.
[13161.06 --> 13161.46]  Mr.
[13161.58 --> 13162.20]  Tech tips.
[13162.62 --> 13167.08]  You mentioned you bought five pairs of badminton shoes since they're all essentially consumables.
[13167.38 --> 13170.88]  Do you wear them evenly or do you use one until it's worn out before using a new pair?
[13171.18 --> 13171.52]  Yes.
[13171.86 --> 13173.14]  I've tried it both ways.
[13173.54 --> 13174.08]  I think I,
[13174.14 --> 13175.38]  I think I like the,
[13175.88 --> 13179.24]  I generally have two active ones is what I've kind of settled on.
[13179.24 --> 13180.54]  So that gives me,
[13180.68 --> 13180.98]  um,
[13181.54 --> 13185.54]  that allows me to take two pairs of shoes to like a tournament because nothing,
[13185.84 --> 13190.80]  nothing destroys your feet faster than just being in like soggy shoes all day.
[13191.32 --> 13191.76]  Um,
[13191.76 --> 13193.62]  so it gives me one to change into,
[13193.74 --> 13195.46]  but if I have too many active ones,
[13195.56 --> 13196.06]  then,
[13196.72 --> 13197.28]  um,
[13198.00 --> 13199.24]  then basically I'm,
[13199.38 --> 13200.52]  I have them out in the open,
[13200.70 --> 13202.32]  turning the soles hard,
[13202.38 --> 13204.70]  like with UV exposure more than I have to.
[13204.78 --> 13207.18]  So I should only have like two active at a time is what I've settled on.
[13207.18 --> 13209.66]  Hi,
[13209.78 --> 13210.18]  LLD.
[13210.40 --> 13214.04]  I got a Zenbook duo for university after your first look video.
[13214.22 --> 13214.70]  It's great.
[13214.96 --> 13215.40]  My question,
[13215.52 --> 13217.98]  did anyone actually daily drive the 2024 model?
[13218.06 --> 13222.42]  And why is there no full review for the 2024 or 2025 versions?
[13223.38 --> 13223.64]  Um,
[13223.72 --> 13224.74]  it's a good question.
[13224.96 --> 13225.18]  I mean,
[13225.18 --> 13227.10]  I think part of it is that it's so,
[13228.42 --> 13229.10]  oh,
[13229.18 --> 13237.16]  there's such iterative progress in the laptop space that the excitement of the
[13237.18 --> 13240.40]  level around a 2025 model.
[13240.96 --> 13241.26]  Um,
[13241.30 --> 13242.92]  if anyone even knows what it is,
[13243.50 --> 13245.54]  like a Zenbook duo,
[13245.90 --> 13246.40]  that's the,
[13246.50 --> 13247.12]  that's the,
[13247.12 --> 13247.40]  the,
[13247.40 --> 13248.38]  the dual screen one,
[13248.44 --> 13249.40]  if I recall correctly,
[13249.40 --> 13249.90]  like it's,
[13250.90 --> 13255.84]  Asus's product lineup is so wide that you have no hope of covering all of them.
[13255.84 --> 13256.28]  Um,
[13256.28 --> 13261.90]  and then the refreshes are so many and so confusingly named that it's hard to,
[13261.90 --> 13264.54]  it's hard to know what to cover.
[13264.54 --> 13267.38]  And it's hard for people to know what they even feel like clicking on.
[13267.50 --> 13271.16]  That's where I think something like the labs is realistically the right answer,
[13271.16 --> 13272.82]  where just every new laptop that comes out,
[13272.88 --> 13273.80]  it rolls into the lab.
[13273.92 --> 13275.84]  We like run the whole suite of testing on it.
[13275.84 --> 13283.94]  And then we can figure out without having to just like guess which ones are actually worth making a video about.
[13284.06 --> 13284.44]  That's,
[13284.52 --> 13288.92]  that's the overall vision for how the labs will work in the long term.
[13288.98 --> 13290.02]  It's going to take a long time though.
[13292.24 --> 13292.68]  Luke.
[13293.26 --> 13293.96]  As in,
[13294.06 --> 13296.28]  if I don't use my muscles and stay active,
[13296.28 --> 13298.12]  I get sad person as well.
[13298.12 --> 13300.84]  I find it hard to find time to relax and rest.
[13300.84 --> 13303.14]  I know you also like the grind.
[13303.28 --> 13304.68]  What helps you relax and feel better?
[13304.90 --> 13305.62]  Grinding hard.
[13306.22 --> 13306.80]  Hard grinder.
[13306.96 --> 13307.10]  There,
[13307.16 --> 13307.92]  I answered it for him.
[13308.84 --> 13310.66]  He's something of a grinder enthusiast.
[13312.20 --> 13314.14]  Note that earlier I said that I'm not gay.
[13314.22 --> 13315.24]  I didn't say anything about Luke.
[13319.94 --> 13322.14]  You never said the chicken only worked on women.
[13323.36 --> 13328.08]  Are things that are very not recommended to do to relax.
[13328.08 --> 13328.78]  Like the,
[13328.78 --> 13331.40]  the games that I tend to like playing are like Tarkov and stuff,
[13331.52 --> 13332.24]  which is just like,
[13332.36 --> 13333.42]  that's not relaxing.
[13334.16 --> 13336.16]  That's like actually enrage-ifying.
[13337.20 --> 13337.64]  Yeah.
[13337.78 --> 13339.94]  Which is the things that I tend to do.
[13340.54 --> 13341.12]  I don't,
[13341.20 --> 13342.28]  I don't have good advice here.
[13342.38 --> 13342.76]  Sorry.
[13343.60 --> 13344.60]  I wish I did.
[13344.66 --> 13345.84]  I should probably work on that.
[13347.34 --> 13349.98]  It's like almost certainly a flaw.
[13350.92 --> 13352.92]  Stressed management is don't.
[13354.92 --> 13355.36]  Yeah.
[13355.36 --> 13356.82]  Let's not take advice from Luke.
[13357.22 --> 13357.62]  No.
[13358.08 --> 13358.74]  I'm kind of,
[13358.94 --> 13359.76]  that's where I'm going.
[13359.96 --> 13360.88]  That's where I'm going with this.
[13360.98 --> 13362.50]  Maybe the wrong person asked for advice here.
[13362.62 --> 13362.78]  I,
[13362.78 --> 13366.84]  I appreciate that you asked and thought that I would have good advice here.
[13367.98 --> 13368.50]  But yeah,
[13368.52 --> 13370.24]  I tend to just like pile on more.
[13370.34 --> 13371.08]  It's probably bad.
[13371.16 --> 13372.50]  I probably have cortisol issues.
[13372.74 --> 13374.32]  It might be why I can't sleep properly,
[13374.46 --> 13374.96]  but you know,
[13375.14 --> 13375.76]  we'll get there.
[13375.86 --> 13376.40]  We'll figure it out.
[13376.62 --> 13377.28]  One thing at a time.
[13377.84 --> 13378.00]  Yeah,
[13378.02 --> 13378.20]  I know.
[13378.26 --> 13379.78]  I saw episode one of the new season.
[13379.86 --> 13381.02]  I haven't seen the second yet though.
[13381.62 --> 13383.56]  I'm very excited about it though.
[13383.90 --> 13387.42]  Cause if there's anyone who deserves to be lampooned,
[13387.42 --> 13389.68]  it's someone who puts down dogs for no reason.
[13390.80 --> 13392.08]  People who are mean to dogs.
[13394.30 --> 13395.04]  How is that?
[13395.10 --> 13397.68]  How that became controversial at all is wild to me.
[13398.48 --> 13398.92]  Wait,
[13398.98 --> 13399.84]  that became controversial?
[13400.28 --> 13400.72]  Apparently.
[13401.08 --> 13401.94]  Depends who you ask.
[13401.94 --> 13406.50]  M.
[13406.50 --> 13407.72]  Doss says,
[13407.84 --> 13409.82]  that's my secret.
[13410.40 --> 13411.86]  I'm always stressed.
[13412.64 --> 13413.08]  Yeah,
[13413.08 --> 13413.62]  pretty much.
[13413.72 --> 13414.08]  It's a,
[13414.14 --> 13415.46]  it's an Avengers reference.
[13416.48 --> 13416.88]  I,
[13417.00 --> 13418.30]  I don't know if you watched that one.
[13418.40 --> 13419.36]  Did you watch that one?
[13419.42 --> 13420.06]  Did you make it that far?
[13420.08 --> 13421.40]  Everyone knows that reference.
[13421.64 --> 13422.62]  I have not watched.
[13422.70 --> 13423.56]  Elijah doesn't.
[13423.84 --> 13425.08]  Elijah doesn't know any references.
[13425.24 --> 13426.34]  He actually does know more now.
[13426.34 --> 13429.80]  I feel like he plays it up.
[13431.42 --> 13432.70]  I hope he plays it up.
[13432.78 --> 13433.66]  I hope he plays it up.
[13434.38 --> 13434.64]  All right.
[13434.66 --> 13435.08]  What's next?
[13435.08 --> 13435.56]  Hey,
[13435.74 --> 13435.92]  L.
[13436.00 --> 13436.62]  Dan sandwich,
[13436.82 --> 13437.90]  Linus working nights.
[13438.14 --> 13439.42]  So I didn't see you,
[13439.54 --> 13442.30]  but I saw dad old's go-kart selfie.
[13442.88 --> 13446.66]  Did you intend to make the meme face or did you just have resting meme face?
[13446.72 --> 13448.40]  I just had resting meme face.
[13448.50 --> 13448.74]  Uh,
[13448.74 --> 13449.42]  I went to,
[13449.56 --> 13451.12]  I went to the go-karts at,
[13451.14 --> 13451.50]  uh,
[13451.52 --> 13455.54]  West Edmonton mall and apparently someone saw me on the leaderboard there.
[13456.34 --> 13456.98]  Um,
[13457.66 --> 13459.36]  not high on it.
[13459.74 --> 13461.22]  It's just to be very clear.
[13461.56 --> 13461.96]  Uh,
[13461.96 --> 13464.06]  we raced at junior speeds because we,
[13464.16 --> 13464.48]  I had,
[13464.62 --> 13464.84]  uh,
[13464.84 --> 13466.94]  I was in the dual cart with one of my kids.
[13467.48 --> 13469.06]  Not that I would have been on the leaderboard,
[13469.12 --> 13470.02]  even in a single cart.
[13470.10 --> 13471.32]  I want to make that clear as well.
[13471.76 --> 13472.18]  Um,
[13472.20 --> 13472.82]  but I was like,
[13472.90 --> 13474.28]  especially not fast.
[13474.28 --> 13476.44]  Cause I was going at half maximum speed,
[13476.50 --> 13477.10]  fun,
[13477.28 --> 13478.04]  fun track.
[13478.46 --> 13478.86]  Um,
[13478.88 --> 13479.84]  even at half speed,
[13479.84 --> 13480.10]  it was,
[13480.18 --> 13480.42]  it was,
[13480.48 --> 13481.16]  it was really fun.
[13481.86 --> 13482.22]  Um,
[13482.24 --> 13482.98]  it was dual level,
[13483.06 --> 13483.28]  right?
[13483.62 --> 13483.92]  Yeah.
[13484.46 --> 13484.98]  But no,
[13485.02 --> 13486.32]  the meme face is just what I look like.
[13486.34 --> 13487.14]  Unfortunately.
[13489.14 --> 13489.58]  Oh,
[13489.64 --> 13490.46]  I have a flex too.
[13490.64 --> 13493.92]  Jake and I came fourth and fifth at the open sauce,
[13493.92 --> 13494.82]  um,
[13494.92 --> 13496.02]  sim racing leaderboard.
[13496.18 --> 13496.38]  Oh,
[13496.42 --> 13497.12]  that's pretty sick,
[13497.22 --> 13498.36]  which was kind of insane.
[13499.36 --> 13499.80]  Uh,
[13499.88 --> 13501.36]  it was like a 10th slower than him.
[13501.52 --> 13501.82]  I meant,
[13502.08 --> 13502.64]  I meant quick.
[13504.08 --> 13506.10]  Class of 2004 here,
[13506.32 --> 13507.24]  finishing my degree.
[13507.70 --> 13507.94]  Linus,
[13507.98 --> 13511.48]  did you ever consider finishing your degree or getting a two or four year?
[13511.80 --> 13512.66]  Would you encourage your kids?
[13512.66 --> 13512.92]  24?
[13512.92 --> 13513.04]  24?
[13514.40 --> 13514.76]  Sorry?
[13515.68 --> 13516.92]  Class of 2004.
[13518.08 --> 13519.50]  Class of 2004.
[13519.80 --> 13519.96]  Yeah.
[13520.08 --> 13520.80]  Finishing degree.
[13521.08 --> 13521.36]  Yeah.
[13521.58 --> 13521.72]  No,
[13521.76 --> 13521.84]  no.
[13521.94 --> 13523.18]  Class of 2004.
[13523.82 --> 13525.16]  So same age as me.
[13525.74 --> 13527.16]  Just now finishing their degree.
[13528.16 --> 13528.38]  Okay.
[13528.38 --> 13529.04]  Like they went back.
[13529.30 --> 13529.54]  Anyway,
[13529.72 --> 13529.86]  sorry.
[13530.22 --> 13530.88]  Carry on Dan,
[13530.92 --> 13532.50]  before you were so rudely interrupted.
[13532.72 --> 13532.86]  No,
[13532.90 --> 13533.22]  that's okay.
[13533.22 --> 13534.10]  I'm used to it from you.
[13534.46 --> 13534.86]  Uh,
[13534.86 --> 13536.50]  getting a two to four year education.
[13536.50 --> 13541.72]  Would you encourage your kids to pursue education or work experience after high school?
[13542.20 --> 13542.50]  I would.
[13542.62 --> 13543.46]  You've taught Luke well,
[13543.52 --> 13543.90]  by the way.
[13545.86 --> 13549.36]  I would encourage them to pursue education or work experience after high school.
[13551.44 --> 13551.88]  Um,
[13551.88 --> 13554.94]  I,
[13554.94 --> 13555.26]  I,
[13555.26 --> 13559.84]  I don't think school was the right place for me.
[13561.30 --> 13561.90]  Um,
[13562.48 --> 13565.72]  I thrive in the,
[13565.88 --> 13566.04]  I,
[13566.16 --> 13566.80]  I actually,
[13567.04 --> 13567.98]  I didn't just survive.
[13567.98 --> 13571.34]  I thrived in the more guided high school experience,
[13571.34 --> 13574.92]  the more handholdy education experience.
[13575.30 --> 13582.08]  I did not do well in the like bigger university self-guided experience.
[13582.48 --> 13588.26]  I have a really hard time motivating myself to learn stuff that I don't already care about,
[13588.44 --> 13590.36]  which is a real challenge for me.
[13590.80 --> 13591.52]  See with computers,
[13591.64 --> 13593.14]  it's easy because I already care about it.
[13593.22 --> 13596.22]  So that's why it was easy to just like learn stuff and make videos about it.
[13596.22 --> 13599.30]  And then I learned to care about making videos,
[13599.40 --> 13599.68]  I guess.
[13599.74 --> 13600.36]  So I don't know.
[13600.40 --> 13602.20]  I absorb some stuff that I don't really care about,
[13602.28 --> 13602.52]  but I,
[13603.26 --> 13604.76]  but then I start to care about it.
[13605.14 --> 13606.80]  And then I learned more of it.
[13606.88 --> 13607.32]  I don't know.
[13607.44 --> 13607.72]  I,
[13607.86 --> 13608.20]  um,
[13608.54 --> 13611.42]  I don't necessarily think that for my career,
[13611.88 --> 13612.46]  um,
[13612.46 --> 13616.08]  I would benefit that much from going back for a degree,
[13616.08 --> 13621.82]  but I could see myself doing something like ever since we brought up the,
[13621.94 --> 13622.20]  uh,
[13622.20 --> 13622.74]  honestly,
[13622.98 --> 13623.70]  not even,
[13623.96 --> 13624.10]  okay.
[13624.10 --> 13627.04]  So I was about to say ever since we found those kit planes,
[13627.70 --> 13628.50]  remember that those,
[13628.58 --> 13628.98]  uh,
[13629.02 --> 13630.30]  that was a few WAN shows ago,
[13630.32 --> 13631.40]  we discovered that you can like,
[13631.84 --> 13634.94]  you can like buy the parts of an airplane and assemble it yourself.
[13635.22 --> 13636.70]  But even before that,
[13636.84 --> 13639.08]  like when we were talking about that gamer jet,
[13639.12 --> 13639.64]  I was like,
[13639.72 --> 13640.02]  man,
[13640.08 --> 13643.18]  how cool would it be to get like,
[13643.32 --> 13643.82]  like,
[13643.96 --> 13644.06]  uh,
[13644.30 --> 13644.74]  again,
[13644.74 --> 13646.44]  this is all relatively speaking.
[13646.44 --> 13649.94]  No one should necessarily look at my lifestyle and think,
[13650.02 --> 13650.08]  oh,
[13650.12 --> 13650.62]  well that's,
[13650.62 --> 13650.86]  you know,
[13650.86 --> 13651.18]  normal,
[13651.78 --> 13652.12]  um,
[13652.22 --> 13654.22]  but a relatively affordable jet.
[13654.30 --> 13656.08]  How cool would it be to like learn to fly it?
[13656.62 --> 13657.32]  Like if I,
[13657.40 --> 13657.80]  if I was,
[13657.88 --> 13659.42]  if I was down to do pilot training,
[13659.50 --> 13660.00]  would you do it?
[13660.68 --> 13662.44]  Cause I think we've talked about this before.
[13663.62 --> 13666.08]  Jet level pilot training is really expensive.
[13666.10 --> 13666.20]  Well,
[13666.22 --> 13666.64]  you have to do,
[13666.72 --> 13669.98]  you have to do regular pilot training before you do any jet level pilot training,
[13670.34 --> 13671.56]  regular pilot training.
[13671.56 --> 13672.84]  I would be interested in.
[13672.90 --> 13673.22]  It's very,
[13673.34 --> 13673.86]  it's very cool.
[13674.62 --> 13675.36]  That'd be super cool.
[13675.50 --> 13675.82]  Interesting.
[13676.22 --> 13676.46]  Yeah.
[13677.26 --> 13677.66]  I'm,
[13677.66 --> 13678.16]  I'm definitely,
[13678.26 --> 13679.72]  I'm definitely open to the idea.
[13679.92 --> 13680.18]  Yeah.
[13680.44 --> 13681.46]  I wanted to do that.
[13681.50 --> 13684.72]  Like since I think we probably first talked about that,
[13684.80 --> 13685.34]  like 2012.
[13686.34 --> 13686.74]  Yeah.
[13686.74 --> 13689.00]  That's been something I've been interested in for like forever.
[13689.22 --> 13689.42]  Yeah.
[13690.08 --> 13690.64]  So like,
[13690.98 --> 13691.58]  I don't know.
[13691.62 --> 13691.90]  Like I,
[13691.90 --> 13694.84]  I think I'd be more likely to do a really cool certification,
[13694.84 --> 13700.90]  like get like a dive master certification or get like a pilot certification or get like,
[13700.90 --> 13701.72]  I think I'd be,
[13701.72 --> 13705.70]  I'd want to like certify to do cool stuff rather than,
[13706.06 --> 13707.42]  rather than go back to academia.
[13708.00 --> 13709.52]  I think that makes a lot more sense.
[13709.98 --> 13711.92]  Like for me and not for everybody.
[13711.92 --> 13712.20]  Like,
[13712.52 --> 13716.08]  I don't think my advice to all of my kids would be the same.
[13716.30 --> 13718.04]  Even I think,
[13718.36 --> 13718.86]  because no,
[13718.90 --> 13720.70]  not everybody's the same for some of them.
[13720.76 --> 13721.84]  I think that,
[13721.98 --> 13724.12]  I think that academics makes a ton of sense.
[13724.12 --> 13724.92]  And for others,
[13724.92 --> 13728.22]  I think they should pursue other endeavors.
[13728.22 --> 13735.02]  And I'm not going to get any into anything specific because that's a little personal in terms of like the information about my various children.
[13735.98 --> 13738.94]  I don't mind talking about like collectively them,
[13739.04 --> 13741.08]  but I don't like to get into the individual specifics,
[13741.08 --> 13741.86]  but yeah,
[13741.90 --> 13742.00]  no,
[13742.06 --> 13745.08]  I don't think I would say the same thing to any of my three.
[13746.00 --> 13746.24]  I mean,
[13746.28 --> 13747.12]  that's what I suspect.
[13747.12 --> 13748.86]  That's probably true for most.
[13749.86 --> 13751.66]  Just groups of people in general.
[13751.66 --> 13752.24]  I don't know.
[13752.30 --> 13753.20]  It seems to be especially,
[13753.42 --> 13755.66]  I don't think that's too weird to say the preschool teacher,
[13755.66 --> 13758.34]  who is the one teacher who had all three of them.
[13758.96 --> 13765.36]  The first thing she said to me when I picked up my youngest after her like second or third day or something like that.
[13765.80 --> 13766.48]  And remember,
[13766.56 --> 13769.62]  this is someone who literally interacts with small children for a living.
[13771.90 --> 13773.90]  She kind of hands her off to me and she goes,
[13774.12 --> 13774.40]  boy,
[13774.46 --> 13775.50]  you sure got a variety pack,
[13775.58 --> 13775.92]  didn't you?
[13779.10 --> 13780.16]  We really did.
[13785.66 --> 13787.52]  Up next.
[13788.66 --> 13788.98]  Yeah.
[13789.40 --> 13789.60]  Yeah.
[13790.16 --> 13790.50]  Linus,
[13790.56 --> 13792.78]  did you like working and growing up on a hobby farm?
[13793.08 --> 13793.64]  What do you think?
[13794.08 --> 13796.30]  What would you think if you had to work on it as an adult?
[13796.64 --> 13796.86]  Well,
[13796.92 --> 13797.78]  it was a hobby farm,
[13797.84 --> 13799.64]  so I didn't really like work on a farm.
[13799.78 --> 13802.82]  Like I did farm like work quite often,
[13803.04 --> 13803.36]  you know,
[13803.50 --> 13805.24]  scooping horse poop and,
[13805.40 --> 13806.16]  and,
[13806.30 --> 13806.58]  you know,
[13806.76 --> 13810.32]  filling potholes on the gravel driveway and,
[13810.44 --> 13811.00]  you know,
[13811.20 --> 13813.28]  getting eggs and washing eggs.
[13813.28 --> 13813.62]  And like,
[13813.64 --> 13815.76]  I did a lot of like farmy type stuff,
[13815.84 --> 13816.50]  but I didn't like,
[13817.26 --> 13817.52]  you know,
[13817.58 --> 13819.50]  rise at the crack of dawn and,
[13819.56 --> 13821.76]  and work the fields and stuff.
[13825.52 --> 13826.00]  I,
[13826.66 --> 13828.46]  it's tough.
[13830.92 --> 13838.04]  I feel like my kids are missing out in a big way by me not providing that,
[13838.18 --> 13839.64]  that upbringing for them.
[13839.64 --> 13842.66]  But I really,
[13842.76 --> 13842.94]  really,
[13843.02 --> 13843.22]  really,
[13843.30 --> 13843.50]  really,
[13843.58 --> 13843.78]  really,
[13843.86 --> 13844.06]  really,
[13844.12 --> 13846.22]  really don't want to do it anymore as an adult.
[13846.70 --> 13849.60]  I don't actually like just like,
[13849.72 --> 13852.82]  I don't even want a dog at this point.
[13853.36 --> 13854.06]  Like the,
[13854.12 --> 13860.94]  the amount of your life that is dictated by the schedule of animal care is not
[13860.94 --> 13865.94]  something that is really compatible with running a hundred plus person
[13865.94 --> 13866.32]  company.
[13866.32 --> 13870.32]  Um,
[13870.72 --> 13874.62]  unless you are hiring people to care for said animals,
[13874.62 --> 13876.12]  in which case that's not a hobby farm anymore.
[13876.12 --> 13877.40]  That's now a commercial farm.
[13877.56 --> 13880.76]  And you're basically asking me why I don't just pull a Jeremy Clarkson,
[13881.42 --> 13881.92]  which who knows?
[13881.96 --> 13882.48]  I might someday,
[13882.68 --> 13885.02]  but it is not this day.
[13887.30 --> 13891.16]  Linus with how much the Samsung fold is improved with the fold seven.
[13891.50 --> 13891.78]  Okay.
[13891.78 --> 13892.98]  Hold on a second.
[13893.62 --> 13894.02]  Okay.
[13894.02 --> 13894.44]  Yes.
[13894.46 --> 13895.70]  I have a lot of cats,
[13895.84 --> 13898.34]  but cats are not a ton of work.
[13898.48 --> 13899.62]  I don't think you have enough cats.
[13900.04 --> 13900.48]  Exactly.
[13900.86 --> 13902.10]  Like cats are fine.
[13902.10 --> 13903.86]  As long as the cats are all getting along.
[13904.00 --> 13908.34]  And as long as they all just like are able to handle the concept of just
[13908.34 --> 13910.94]  leaving food and water out and they just eat when they're hungry and drink
[13910.94 --> 13911.64]  when they're thirsty.
[13911.64 --> 13912.68]  Like dude,
[13912.68 --> 13913.68]  we have litter robots.
[13913.92 --> 13916.58]  We went away for four days almost.
[13917.96 --> 13918.90]  And they were fine.
[13919.54 --> 13923.86]  We came home and they greeted us at the door and they had each other for company while
[13923.86 --> 13924.36]  we were gone.
[13924.58 --> 13925.86]  Cats are so easy.
[13926.52 --> 13927.26]  So easy.
[13927.64 --> 13927.88]  Okay.
[13928.06 --> 13928.22]  Sorry.
[13928.30 --> 13928.58]  Carry on.
[13928.58 --> 13932.96]  With how much the Samsung fold has improved the fold seven compared to the one you drowned
[13932.96 --> 13936.40]  years ago and pixel fold being really good as well.
[13936.56 --> 13939.36]  Do you see yourself daily driving a foldable again?
[13939.64 --> 13939.96]  Yes.
[13940.88 --> 13944.70]  Fold seven is going to be my next phone after I do graphene OS,
[13944.88 --> 13948.56]  or I might actually skip right to the fold because people keep bringing it up today.
[13948.56 --> 13951.72]  And I'm genuinely very excited to use it.
[13951.72 --> 13952.14]  Um,
[13952.14 --> 13953.36]  and then do graphene OS after.
[13955.28 --> 13960.44]  Where is the farthest you've traveled for a tech product either to buy or to view?
[13960.76 --> 13962.70]  And what was said product?
[13963.20 --> 13963.36]  Hmm.
[13964.26 --> 13965.70]  Farthest I've traveled to view.
[13966.28 --> 13967.32]  I went to,
[13967.68 --> 13969.50]  this isn't necessarily further,
[13970.20 --> 13970.78]  um,
[13971.38 --> 13973.02]  but it's a more difficult trip.
[13973.16 --> 13978.06]  I went to China for a Microsoft surface launch way back in the day.
[13978.56 --> 13979.36]  2017,
[13979.86 --> 13980.14]  I think.
[13982.94 --> 13983.54]  You know what?
[13983.56 --> 13986.98]  I think China's probably the farthest I've ever gone to.
[13988.84 --> 13989.28]  Ah,
[13989.48 --> 13989.80]  Ooh,
[13989.96 --> 13990.58]  maybe not.
[13990.66 --> 13990.92]  I mean,
[13990.92 --> 13995.22]  that Renault thing that I did in Paris is what's farther from here?
[13995.22 --> 13996.26]  Shenzhen or Paris?
[13996.44 --> 13996.64]  Dan,
[13996.86 --> 13997.28]  do you know?
[13997.44 --> 13997.68]  Mapping.
[14005.32 --> 14006.72]  If that's the case,
[14006.72 --> 14010.68]  if Germany's farther than it would be Germany.
[14012.20 --> 14013.04]  To see cherry.
[14014.02 --> 14014.42]  Yeah.
[14015.62 --> 14016.02]  Yeah.
[14016.08 --> 14016.58]  I think I,
[14016.68 --> 14018.62]  does it count if it's professionally though,
[14018.70 --> 14021.16]  or would it have to be personally for this question?
[14021.88 --> 14023.12]  Like to buy something?
[14023.12 --> 14024.42]  I said buy or view.
[14024.58 --> 14024.86]  Who would,
[14024.92 --> 14025.44]  who would go to,
[14025.54 --> 14027.86]  who would travel to view a product that they're not buying?
[14028.08 --> 14028.68]  I'm going to,
[14028.76 --> 14029.48]  I'm going to go with,
[14029.60 --> 14031.30]  I'm going to go with buy.
[14031.68 --> 14036.28]  And the farthest I ever went to buy something was to Taiwan to buy the gold GPU.
[14037.04 --> 14037.36]  The,
[14037.48 --> 14037.80]  the,
[14037.80 --> 14040.30]  the thing that I laid out in the video was the truth.
[14040.42 --> 14041.98]  I couldn't get it sent here.
[14042.40 --> 14046.04]  It had to be transferred from like the,
[14046.04 --> 14050.38]  the middle Eastern region to like through HQ.
[14050.80 --> 14056.34]  And I was able to buy it through like an intermediary basically.
[14056.78 --> 14057.06]  Um,
[14057.24 --> 14059.02]  so that was the farthest I ever went to buy something.
[14059.02 --> 14060.08]  And then I ended up giving it away,
[14060.20 --> 14061.94]  which I had,
[14062.00 --> 14063.80]  I genuinely did not intend to do.
[14063.86 --> 14064.82]  It was James who,
[14064.96 --> 14065.26]  uh,
[14066.26 --> 14067.78]  it wasn't that he twisted my arm.
[14067.88 --> 14070.02]  It was that he pitched me a content idea.
[14070.02 --> 14070.92]  I couldn't resist.
[14071.78 --> 14072.54]  And I was like,
[14072.62 --> 14073.18]  ah,
[14073.82 --> 14076.14]  now I have to do it.
[14076.42 --> 14077.70]  Cause I was going to just keep it.
[14077.84 --> 14079.16]  And I was going to build like a sick,
[14079.26 --> 14079.54]  like,
[14079.86 --> 14081.08]  like black and gold,
[14081.08 --> 14081.64]  uh,
[14081.64 --> 14081.80]  with,
[14081.92 --> 14083.50]  cause we have a bunch of gold fittings kicking around.
[14083.58 --> 14086.32]  Like I was going to like redo my machine and like all black and gold.
[14086.34 --> 14087.40]  With the astral GPU.
[14087.56 --> 14090.62]  And then the stupidest part was that I was going to have to remove the gold
[14090.62 --> 14092.94]  cooler in order to water cool it.
[14093.06 --> 14096.32]  So I was going to get a block and then I was going to like gold plate it or
[14096.32 --> 14098.08]  something like I was going to be a whole thing.
[14098.20 --> 14098.72]  Uh,
[14098.72 --> 14099.04]  but I,
[14099.08 --> 14099.74]  I'm really,
[14099.90 --> 14101.24]  I'm really happy with how,
[14101.40 --> 14101.66]  um,
[14101.74 --> 14104.12]  how that video turned out and really happy with the,
[14104.22 --> 14104.52]  uh,
[14104.64 --> 14107.36]  the person who happened to come across us and win it this year.
[14107.36 --> 14109.20]  So I'm glad we did it.
[14110.22 --> 14111.32]  That's all I got.
[14111.68 --> 14112.26]  What's farther,
[14112.38 --> 14112.52]  Dan?
[14112.96 --> 14116.32]  That's about 6,500 miles to Shenzhen and about five,
[14116.34 --> 14117.68]  4,000 to Paris.
[14118.22 --> 14118.62]  Okay.
[14118.76 --> 14120.82]  So then the answer is China for both of us.
[14120.88 --> 14121.22]  Then Luke.
[14122.42 --> 14126.42]  So the farthest I went to look at something as probably,
[14126.42 --> 14127.74]  um,
[14127.74 --> 14129.56]  Shenzhen's a little further than Taipei,
[14129.62 --> 14129.78]  right?
[14130.00 --> 14131.54]  I think it's a little further.
[14131.54 --> 14134.66]  I legitimately,
[14135.00 --> 14136.82]  this title is a hundred percent true.
[14137.38 --> 14140.82]  I flew all the way to China just so I could try this.
[14146.42 --> 14146.98]  All right.
[14147.30 --> 14148.68]  And I saw robot Yao Ming.
[14150.84 --> 14151.28]  Nice.
[14151.40 --> 14152.92]  That apparently is actual size,
[14153.08 --> 14154.58]  but he cheated.
[14154.68 --> 14155.26]  He's on a thing.
[14156.16 --> 14156.60]  Yeah.
[14156.60 --> 14156.96]  Yeah.
[14157.10 --> 14158.76]  So this was to see the OG,
[14159.06 --> 14159.86]  uh,
[14159.88 --> 14160.76]  badminton robot.
[14162.26 --> 14164.60]  I am not going to let you see the sphere before we go.
[14164.82 --> 14165.06]  Uh,
[14165.16 --> 14169.06]  some people pointed out a very obvious and good point that I would have normally
[14169.06 --> 14169.40]  caught,
[14169.46 --> 14170.30]  but definitely didn't,
[14170.40 --> 14171.66]  which is that if I show you the sphere,
[14171.72 --> 14172.70]  you can figure out where I am.
[14172.78 --> 14173.36]  There are 24,
[14173.50 --> 14174.68]  seven live streams of the sphere.
[14174.80 --> 14177.94]  And if you go back to that point in the WAN show,
[14178.10 --> 14180.24]  you could see the cats that I was talking about.
[14180.72 --> 14182.28]  So there you go.
[14182.28 --> 14185.44]  It ended up not being as impressive as I'd hoped.
[14186.50 --> 14187.14]  The sphere?
[14187.38 --> 14187.60]  No,
[14187.66 --> 14189.76]  the badminton robot that I'm showing the audience.
[14190.10 --> 14191.28]  Was it like not good?
[14192.06 --> 14192.42]  Uh,
[14192.90 --> 14194.64]  it's not that it's not good.
[14195.00 --> 14196.02]  It's just that I,
[14196.06 --> 14196.36]  I don't know.
[14196.40 --> 14196.62]  I just,
[14196.70 --> 14197.64]  I thought it would be better.
[14199.30 --> 14199.98]  Like I,
[14200.58 --> 14203.84]  to make it look as good as it did in the other videos,
[14203.84 --> 14205.70]  they had to really like try.
[14206.32 --> 14210.76]  Whereas like I tried to push it a little bit and it crumbled.
[14210.94 --> 14211.62]  Immediately failed.
[14211.74 --> 14211.86]  Yep.
[14213.14 --> 14213.34]  Yeah.
[14213.34 --> 14214.20]  Let's wrap it up boys.
[14214.44 --> 14214.62]  Oh,
[14214.68 --> 14215.12]  do you gotta go?
[14215.24 --> 14215.54]  Okay.
[14215.98 --> 14216.72]  See you again next week.
[14216.78 --> 14217.32]  Same bad time.
[14217.40 --> 14217.88]  Same bad time.
[14217.98 --> 14218.82]  I needed to for hours.
[14219.02 --> 14219.30]  Okay.
[14219.36 --> 14219.70]  Bye.
[14222.18 --> 14222.52]  All right.
[14222.52 --> 14222.68]  Bye,
[14222.72 --> 14222.90]  Luke.
[14224.10 --> 14224.84]  Have a good weekend.
[14225.84 --> 14226.24]  Thank you.

[14249.90 --> 14250.42]  Bye bye.
[14250.42 --> 14250.66]  Bye bye.
[14250.66 --> 14250.74]  Bye bye.
