[0.00 --> 10.00]  It's Friday afternoon somewhere!
[10.00 --> 12.80]  What's up everyone and welcome to the WAN Show!
[12.80 --> 16.00]  We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[16.00 --> 18.50]  Oh wow, where do we even start?
[18.50 --> 22.00]  Ah yes, the YouTube Viewpocalypse!
[22.00 --> 28.00]  Which is real, or isn't real, or is caused by YouTube, or is caused by ad blockers.
[28.00 --> 32.00]  Guess what? It's over. Except it isn't.
[32.00 --> 35.00]  And we have the answers. Except people disagree.
[35.00 --> 37.00]  We don't.
[37.00 --> 40.00]  In other news, what?!
[40.00 --> 43.00]  Nvidia just invested 5 bills.
[43.00 --> 46.00]  5 billion dollars in Intel.
[46.00 --> 49.00]  Which they're gonna use to...
[49.00 --> 53.00]  Oh, okay. Bury AMD.
[53.00 --> 55.00]  That actually checks out.
[55.00 --> 59.00]  That seems like the kind of plan Nvidia would have. What else we got going up?
[59.00 --> 64.00]  We've got Asus gaming laptops that have apparently been broken since 2021.
[64.00 --> 68.00]  And also, someone made a Linus-sized screwdriver note.
[68.00 --> 73.00]  Does that mean that it's really small? Or that it's the size of a human?
[73.00 --> 74.00]  Or that it's a small human?
[74.00 --> 75.00]  We'll never know.
[75.00 --> 76.00]  Well, we'll know soon.
[76.00 --> 77.00]  Hmm.
[77.00 --> 78.00]  What?
[78.00 --> 79.00]  Woah.
[79.00 --> 80.00]  Hmm.
[80.00 --> 82.00]  Is that's a high level?
[82.00 --> 85.50]  Even though the H兴 all lasts a day...
[85.50 --> 95.00]  Oh, ok, Chowd.
[96.00 --> 98.00]  Sounds like a high level.
[98.00 --> 110.00]  The show is brought to you today by Odoo, Vessi, and AMD, alongside, of course, our wrap partner, Dbrand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[110.10 --> 113.76]  That's right, folks. You may have noticed there is a new WAN intro.
[114.14 --> 117.82]  That's going to be our super, super rapid fire first topic.
[118.00 --> 120.10]  It was made by Reddit.
[120.42 --> 121.22]  Oh, whoops.
[122.78 --> 123.68]  Linus Laptop.
[123.68 --> 124.12]  What are you doing?
[125.00 --> 127.34]  I think my screen share is broken.
[128.56 --> 129.30]  Thanks, Dan.
[129.94 --> 132.86]  Was made by Reddit user TroubleInMyBrain.
[134.56 --> 135.68]  I mean...
[135.68 --> 135.98]  Fantastic name.
[136.24 --> 136.46]  Yeah.
[136.70 --> 137.94]  They are on Reddit, so it makes sense.
[138.04 --> 144.32]  It was a pretty chaotic sort of intro, so I guess I could agree with that.
[144.86 --> 148.16]  Dude, okay, we're going off the rails already on the show this week.
[148.26 --> 150.80]  I have a serious problem with Reddit.
[151.52 --> 157.10]  There was yet another thread on Reddit earlier this week asking...
[157.10 --> 157.96]  Ah, yes, here we go.
[158.00 --> 158.32]  There.
[159.68 --> 160.36]  Thank you.
[160.54 --> 161.64]  Trouble in my brain!
[162.38 --> 168.30]  There was a thread on Reddit, yet another thread on Reddit this week, asking where the mod mat is.
[168.84 --> 172.12]  As I've said before, the mod mat will come when it is ready.
[172.24 --> 173.16]  It's like a wizard.
[173.16 --> 175.76]  It arrives exactly when it intends to.
[175.76 --> 188.44]  And one of the top upvoted responses to, you know, why is the mod mat late was from some random f***ing person whose response was,
[188.44 --> 197.54]  I think it's because of pending legal action between Gamers Nexus and Linus Tech Tips.
[197.54 --> 199.54]  And this response had the most upvotes.
[199.54 --> 207.22]  And I basically responded and I said, hey, you have no idea what you're talking about.
[207.22 --> 209.22]  And I got...
[209.22 --> 209.76]  Also stop.
[209.76 --> 211.18]  Intensely downvoted.
[212.30 --> 212.90]  Really?
[212.90 --> 215.48]  And they responded saying, I said, I think.
[215.48 --> 218.50]  And I'm kind of sitting here going, okay.
[218.50 --> 223.10]  But just because you think does not therefore mean you are.
[223.30 --> 226.04]  It just means that you had a keyboard.
[226.78 --> 228.50]  That's literally...
[228.50 --> 232.80]  It's so irresponsible.
[233.28 --> 235.66]  And yes, you have said, I think.
[236.12 --> 241.38]  But it's kind of like if I were to, you know, take a public figure.
[241.38 --> 245.74]  Let's choose someone beloved so that we can all be sure that I don't mean any of this.
[245.86 --> 249.38]  It's like if I were to take a public figure like Keanu Reeves and say,
[249.76 --> 261.12]  I think Keanu Reeves actually hates dogs and would never fight to defend his dog's honor and avenge his dog if his dog died.
[261.46 --> 268.94]  I think he probably destroys SPCAs in his free time.
[269.62 --> 270.14]  Allegedly.
[270.14 --> 271.26]  Allegedly.
[271.26 --> 272.60]  That's still...
[272.60 --> 283.64]  That's still stoking a flame that there's no reason for it to exist for no reason whatsoever other than just that you had a random,
[284.10 --> 288.58]  literally random thought that you know absolutely nothing about and you posted it on the internet.
[289.24 --> 294.68]  And the really horrible thing about Reddit is that by people upvoting this,
[294.68 --> 300.12]  and I realize this is probably not going to be a revelation to people who use Reddit or the internet in general regularly,
[300.14 --> 312.38]  but by posting it to Reddit, the crappy thing about the way that platform works is that all it takes is for a bunch of people who are realistically not reading very carefully to go,
[312.38 --> 314.30]  I don't know, yeah, that seems like kind of plausible.
[314.80 --> 316.74]  And it adds credibility to it.
[317.00 --> 318.52]  But there was no credibility.
[318.74 --> 327.12]  You are a random person who knows literally fucking nothing about the situation and just said a random thing that you pulled out of your ass.
[327.12 --> 330.74]  And now that's a thing that exists.
[331.08 --> 332.90]  No, that's not happening.
[333.30 --> 337.64]  And if you don't know what is going on with something, here's an idea.
[338.24 --> 341.36]  Just take your keyboard and put it away.
[341.36 --> 351.90]  Please don't perpetuate stuff like that because we're fine right now and that would be really great if it could continue.
[352.16 --> 353.82]  And stuff like that does not...
[353.82 --> 354.74]  It's utterly unhelpful.
[355.40 --> 355.70]  Yeah.
[355.98 --> 360.24]  You've literally done nothing that could have any kind of positive impact to anyone.
[360.40 --> 363.12]  The only possible outcome is negativity.
[363.38 --> 364.60]  That's the only possible outcome.
[364.60 --> 373.86]  And it's just frustrating because I see so much stuff like this on our subreddit.
[374.02 --> 380.28]  And I think people know that while we do have some staff that are on the moderation team of the subreddit,
[380.36 --> 386.60]  we don't actually really moderate except in areas that could be around like employee safety, for instance.
[387.28 --> 390.40]  So we tend to just kind of leave it be.
[390.40 --> 398.48]  But it's stuff like this that makes me tempted to kind of go, yeah, maybe we should just take a more active role in moderating this.
[398.56 --> 403.38]  And when we see people speculating about, you know, why someone departed the company, for instance,
[404.20 --> 408.40]  we just immediately ban them because you literally shouldn't be talking about it.
[408.50 --> 409.86]  You actually don't know.
[410.08 --> 413.58]  And a lot of the time lately, and it's been interesting to watch, right?
[413.58 --> 419.56]  Because it basically just ebbs and flows according to how the community is just like feeling.
[420.24 --> 425.36]  When the community is feeling really negative towards LTT, the speculation will all be that, you know,
[425.76 --> 431.20]  Linus is narcissistic and the company is horrible and it's a horrible place to work.
[431.34 --> 435.94]  And when the community is just kind of like feeling pretty good, then it's all going to be,
[436.36 --> 440.24]  oh, I mean, maybe it was just their time and the company did nothing wrong.
[440.24 --> 442.38]  Almost always.
[442.84 --> 448.98]  It is more nuanced than that because, as it turns out, people and their situations don't fit into tidy little boxes.
[449.40 --> 453.16]  And what you should really do, if you don't know, is shut the f*** up.
[455.64 --> 459.52]  That's the best thing to do if you just actually have no idea what you're talking about.
[460.10 --> 463.64]  I mean, there was that weird thread about my travel.
[463.64 --> 467.62]  This is extremely unimportant, but it's just a funny example.
[467.86 --> 470.86]  Like there was a thread that was titled,
[471.16 --> 477.28]  So to get this straight, Luke traveled from Munich on a non-sleeper night train with changes from Munich to Berlin to fly to Frankfurt.
[477.28 --> 480.42]  And it was, it was flaming me.
[480.58 --> 484.22]  And then it transitioned into flaming the person who books our business travel.
[486.40 --> 493.34]  And it got multiple edits, but like the title stayed the same and the initial information stayed the same.
[493.34 --> 501.30]  And eventually someone like a few people responded with like what actually happened because it was clarified in the show.
[501.38 --> 503.96]  The person just didn't watch far enough or maybe they only watched the clip.
[504.00 --> 508.18]  And I don't know if the clarification was in the clip of like why it had to happen that way.
[508.18 --> 516.34]  But somebody responded with like, it was probably this, which was, you know, what actually happened where that was pre-booked.
[516.34 --> 521.06]  And I booked my other stuff later on in the flights from Berlin to where I was actually going really, really bad.
[521.14 --> 523.56]  So I had to go through Munich and like they figured kind of everything out.
[524.12 --> 535.72]  But that probably had seven upvotes because the storm of people being outraged at how stupid you were or how stupid Vance is had already taken place.
[535.72 --> 548.72]  And it's like, bro, no, my, my biggest thing actually is that the, the edit went in and the, the person like to, to all credit to the OP, to be completely honest, they recognize an in their edit.
[548.72 --> 551.72]  They said, I guess it shows maybe I should listen more carefully next time.
[552.26 --> 552.66]  Nice.
[552.86 --> 555.66]  Which is an admittance that like almost no one would do.
[555.66 --> 556.76]  So like, oh yeah.
[556.94 --> 561.16]  But he just speculated on legal action, like doubled down in the response.
[561.24 --> 561.46]  Yeah.
[561.72 --> 563.06]  I said, I think.
[563.84 --> 564.24]  Yeah.
[564.24 --> 571.42]  So like, I have to give OP credit here for saying that, but I did note that after that edit, it says edit important.
[571.42 --> 573.12]  And it clarifies what actually happened.
[573.34 --> 576.06]  The post got 300 more upvotes.
[577.64 --> 581.98]  When that edit came in, it was at 1700, or at least that's when I first saw it.
[582.02 --> 582.92]  It might've even been earlier.
[583.02 --> 589.22]  And then I saw it rise up to 2k, which means that there was probably some people that saw the edit and were downvoting it.
[589.22 --> 592.68]  And there was just that many more people that upvoted it.
[592.68 --> 597.62]  So it's just like, it perpetuates this thing that like, you know, Vance and I have no idea what we're doing.
[597.76 --> 600.62]  And it's like, no, that's like really not what happened.
[600.84 --> 603.38]  Which to be clear, I'm at least 50% behind.
[605.20 --> 608.96]  Like Vance seems pretty competent, but you, dude, come on.
[609.14 --> 609.90]  I don't, yeah, I don't know.
[609.90 --> 611.90]  I don't really do complicated travel.
[611.90 --> 614.44]  More than one out of the last five shows.
[615.58 --> 619.18]  Can't even find his chair from secret lab, our chair partner.
[619.66 --> 623.20]  Not even using his laptop from our laptop partner, Dell.
[623.64 --> 626.80]  Do you even have a D brand skin on you right now?
[627.34 --> 627.72]  I do.
[627.88 --> 628.20]  I do.
[628.40 --> 628.76]  I do.
[629.26 --> 629.54]  All right.
[629.78 --> 630.70]  33%.
[630.70 --> 631.56]  That ain't bad.
[632.36 --> 632.50]  Yeah.
[632.50 --> 633.02]  I got it.
[633.08 --> 633.40]  We're good.
[633.64 --> 636.22]  It ain't great, but it could be worse.
[636.22 --> 637.32]  I don't really care.
[637.32 --> 639.86]  It impacts my life pretty much not at all.
[639.94 --> 643.22]  If people think I know how to take trains and planes properly or not.
[643.34 --> 643.98]  Or automobiles.
[644.56 --> 645.44]  Or automobiles.
[645.64 --> 646.50]  They were all involved.
[647.42 --> 650.94]  But it's just, it's just, it's just funny.
[651.30 --> 655.54]  Because something that was just like clearly incorrect took off.
[655.78 --> 657.24]  And it just gets all this momentum.
[658.04 --> 658.22]  Yep.
[658.30 --> 658.76]  Yep.
[658.96 --> 663.54]  And it's very hard to change momentum, which is something that we've gone through.
[663.54 --> 671.74]  Is it doesn't matter what the nuance is, what the facts are after a momentum storm has already
[671.74 --> 672.56]  taken place.
[673.14 --> 679.06]  And I just, I don't know how to fix that because it seems like people like it that way.
[679.70 --> 685.42]  That is what makes our, that's what makes our lizard brains, our tribalistic instincts
[685.42 --> 686.18]  satisfied.
[686.18 --> 687.94]  Um, okay.
[687.98 --> 691.40]  There's just one more thing that I'm going to rant about before I swear we're actually
[691.40 --> 692.56]  going to start this show.
[693.90 --> 694.78]  Ah, man.
[694.94 --> 699.36]  Thankfully, this isn't a Reddit thread, but Osama in floatplane chat says, Linus thinks
[699.36 --> 704.04]  eggshell color paint is ideal yet did not use it for scrapyard wars.
[704.60 --> 705.00]  Okay.
[706.00 --> 706.80]  A couple of things here.
[706.98 --> 707.96]  Paint rant incoming.
[709.02 --> 709.52]  Eggshell.
[709.66 --> 711.34]  We're going to need a shirt for this or something.
[712.02 --> 715.24]  Eggshell is not a f***ing color.
[715.24 --> 716.24]  Eggshell.
[716.24 --> 719.36]  Have you ever seen an egg?
[720.04 --> 720.42]  Okay.
[721.52 --> 724.66]  Have you ever opened a pack of eggs?
[725.28 --> 725.60]  Okay.
[725.74 --> 726.44]  Check this out.
[726.66 --> 726.82]  Okay.
[726.88 --> 727.44]  Check this.
[728.12 --> 730.96]  There is no such thing as egg color.
[731.84 --> 733.12]  Those are eggs.
[734.12 --> 735.34]  These are eggs.
[736.32 --> 737.84]  These are even eggs.
[739.28 --> 740.78]  There is no egg color.
[741.56 --> 743.04]  Some of those might be AI eggs.
[743.22 --> 744.12]  This might be fake news.
[744.12 --> 745.02]  You're fake news.
[745.24 --> 748.38]  Eggshell is a paint finish.
[748.78 --> 750.50]  It is a surface sheen.
[751.26 --> 758.90]  And it is roughly like an eggshell where it has a little bit of shine, but is more forgiving
[758.90 --> 763.20]  of surface imperfections than like a semi-gloss or a gloss.
[763.20 --> 764.74]  Okay?
[764.74 --> 766.84]  Thank you.
[766.84 --> 769.38]  I am ready to calm down now.
[769.38 --> 774.50]  And move into our next topic, which will surely keep me calm.
[774.98 --> 782.92]  The YouTube viewpocalypse where our viewership plummeted and we were having thoughts of existential
[782.92 --> 787.58]  risk for our entire livelihoods and the hundred plus people who work here.
[787.58 --> 792.90]  And there were tough conversations going on about like, what would it mean if our viewership
[792.90 --> 795.04]  was actually down to half of what it is?
[795.04 --> 798.52]  And it turns out that it was all YouTube's fault.
[798.52 --> 799.84]  And then it turns out it wasn't.
[799.84 --> 803.34]  I'm going to have to just read the notes on this one because buckle in.
[803.34 --> 808.10]  This has been a wild ride and it's involved us, multiple members of the community.
[808.48 --> 813.26]  I'm not going to name them, you know, because of, you know, their privacy and also they don't
[813.26 --> 815.02]  necessarily want to be public figures.
[815.24 --> 818.24]  But it has involved people that we know at YouTube.
[818.52 --> 821.88]  It has involved people in the ad blocking community.
[821.88 --> 823.28]  Let's get started.
[823.52 --> 828.90]  It seems like the YouTube viewpocalypse may not be YouTube's fault.
[830.40 --> 832.18]  Allegedly, I think.
[832.80 --> 833.06]  Eh?
[833.24 --> 833.74]  See that?
[833.94 --> 834.36]  See that?
[834.44 --> 834.68]  Anyway.
[835.08 --> 841.08]  On Monday, September 15th, YouTube finally addressed concerns over view tracking that were raised
[841.08 --> 846.32]  by multiple creators over the last few weeks, saying in a blog post that it investigated
[846.32 --> 847.26]  the issue.
[847.26 --> 855.34]  So TLDR is, and again, this shows why speculation can be extremely unhelpful.
[855.34 --> 861.54]  It has nothing to do with restricted mode, which was something that many users and some
[861.54 --> 862.72]  creators were speculating.
[863.34 --> 865.22]  And restricted mode is completely optional.
[865.40 --> 868.82]  It's a manual setting and has nothing to do with the recent age verification rollout.
[869.74 --> 875.68]  YouTube also stated that their viewership systems are working correctly and that there is
[875.68 --> 878.52]  no systemic issue that is impacting creators.
[879.42 --> 884.30]  Possible causes of view count drops include a return to baseline after a view spike, normal
[884.30 --> 885.72]  fluctuations in viewing habits.
[885.92 --> 889.18]  That was one of the first things that one of my contacts at YouTube brought up is that
[889.18 --> 894.54]  we actually do tend to have a bit of a September hangover once the students go home for the
[894.54 --> 894.76]  summer.
[895.72 --> 900.44]  Go back to school, which is not where their homes are, unless they go to boarding school.
[900.44 --> 903.22]  But either way, it wouldn't be for the summer.
[903.32 --> 904.10]  It would be for the fall.
[904.62 --> 908.08]  Anyway, competition from other channels and topics.
[908.40 --> 912.52]  And this is usually the response that I get from YouTube whenever I bring up issues with
[912.52 --> 913.12]  our viewership.
[913.20 --> 914.32]  They basically say, get good.
[914.36 --> 915.86]  And I say, OK, I'll do my best.
[915.92 --> 916.24]  Yes, sir.
[917.30 --> 920.86]  And number four, this was kind of like slipped in there.
[921.56 --> 926.28]  Updates to ad blockers that could be impacting view count accuracy.
[926.28 --> 926.72]  Hmm.
[927.72 --> 932.60]  Oddly specific compared to the other three, which are basically just like, yeah, you know,
[932.72 --> 934.06]  seasonality also get good.
[935.20 --> 942.48]  The previous day, MMO YouTuber Josh Strife Hayes pointed out that his views from specifically
[942.48 --> 948.66]  computer users fell off a cliff, which would be consistent with the going theory that YouTube
[948.66 --> 954.32]  stopped counting views from devices that had ad block installed, which usually tend to be
[954.32 --> 957.72]  computers, since this may surprise our viewers.
[957.88 --> 963.26]  But most people, even the ones who are capable of installing a browser extension, are either
[963.26 --> 968.34]  too lazy or not technically proficient enough to install ad blocking on their mobile devices.
[968.34 --> 980.08]  I would say, just to interject really quick, if you want a longer video to explain everything
[980.08 --> 984.68]  that's going on, his video specifically, I think is the most well-encompassing right now.
[984.82 --> 986.96]  I haven't necessarily seen all of them, but his is really good.
[987.56 --> 993.94]  Josh also theorized, like Google did, that a change on the ad blocker side could be to
[993.94 --> 994.24]  blame.
[994.94 --> 1001.30]  Then, on Tuesday, September 16th, GitHub user Scratchy, how do I pronounce that?
[1001.96 --> 1003.34]  I think, you know what?
[1003.46 --> 1004.48]  There's an X in there.
[1004.56 --> 1005.68]  I'm going to treat it as a variable.
[1005.92 --> 1006.88]  Their name is Scratchy.
[1007.42 --> 1013.76]  Identified a change to EasyList, specifically its affiliated EasyPrivacyList, which is used
[1013.76 --> 1017.06]  by multiple ad blockers letting them know what to block.
[1017.06 --> 1022.90]  Through their own testing, Scratchy found that this change appeared to block YouTube's
[1022.90 --> 1028.10]  view counters, which was then corroborated by YouTubers Jeff Geerling, Theo Joe, and probably
[1028.10 --> 1029.48]  some other very awesome people.
[1030.22 --> 1036.06]  Although ad block users could let YouTube register their views by simply disabling the EasyPrivacyList
[1036.06 --> 1041.50]  in most popular ad blockers, Scratchy also published a custom filter that lets YouTube's
[1041.50 --> 1045.58]  view tracking URL through but leaves the rest of the EasyPrivacyList enabled so users can
[1045.58 --> 1048.34]  let YouTube count their views while still protecting their privacy.
[1048.86 --> 1054.22]  Because, and this is a fun fact, most ads are also trackers.
[1054.94 --> 1055.34]  Absolutely.
[1055.82 --> 1062.56]  And by most, I mean, like, technically some aren't, but you might as well assume they all
[1062.56 --> 1062.74]  are.
[1062.74 --> 1069.78]  As of Wednesday, September the 17th, the EasyPrivacyList is not filtering the YouTube view tracker.
[1069.78 --> 1077.62]  However, some maintainers, including RyanBR slash Fanboy, still think that EasyPrivacy wasn't
[1077.62 --> 1080.00]  related to the YouTube issue at all.
[1080.00 --> 1087.40]  Is this the, uh, is this the link to the somewhat spicy, um, no, okay, there was, there was some
[1087.40 --> 1091.96]  spicy discussion that took place on GitHub, but this doesn't appear to be that spicy.
[1091.98 --> 1092.82]  I think it's a different thread.
[1093.00 --> 1093.22]  Yep.
[1093.30 --> 1093.54]  Yep.
[1093.54 --> 1094.22]  That makes sense.
[1094.56 --> 1098.62]  Uh, maintainers for EasyList, Ublock Origin, and other tools are still testing ways for ad
[1098.62 --> 1101.70]  blockers to balance ad blocking and privacy protection.
[1101.70 --> 1106.94]  Sorry, sorry, Freudian slipped there, uh, while also allowing YouTube to detect views properly.
[1106.94 --> 1110.86]  So the immediate crisis may be over or it might not be.
[1111.00 --> 1114.32]  Uh, we probably need more data.
[1115.46 --> 1121.12]  There's also some funky stuff where like, and I, I believe this has gone through in Josh
[1121.12 --> 1121.92]  Reif Hayes' video.
[1122.14 --> 1122.76]  I don't remember.
[1123.22 --> 1131.40]  Um, but like even YouTube premium member viewership was impacted here because even if you had YouTube
[1131.40 --> 1137.64]  premium, but then also ran ad block, which is a setup that I know a few people do, um,
[1137.76 --> 1139.90]  the telemetry data was still blocked.
[1139.90 --> 1146.98]  That's even a setup that we've talked about how it definitely supports creators, uh, because
[1146.98 --> 1153.50]  from our understanding of it, it did support creators effectively better than allowing ads
[1153.50 --> 1153.92]  to run.
[1154.20 --> 1155.52]  Um, and it, and it did.
[1155.70 --> 1161.34]  And it turns out that, man, this, this reopens the whole,
[1161.40 --> 1169.02]  ad block piracy conversation in a way that honestly is giving me like PTSD shakes.
[1169.02 --> 1173.38]  Um, I saw, I saw some really interesting discussions.
[1173.52 --> 1176.34]  A lot of people don't really know how it works.
[1176.40 --> 1180.84]  I think there was a discussion saying like, oh, okay, but this like doesn't really affect
[1180.84 --> 1181.66]  them at all.
[1181.66 --> 1182.76]  So like, why should I care?
[1182.76 --> 1183.76]  Cause revenue's flat.
[1183.76 --> 1191.06]  It's like, yeah, AdSense revenue is, but like not other things.
[1191.06 --> 1195.28]  Like we, we've, our sponsors, as far as my understanding goes, have been really cool about
[1195.28 --> 1200.18]  this, but especially if there's a sponsor looking at a prospective channel.
[1200.32 --> 1203.16]  I think it's more that our business team are hard asses.
[1203.88 --> 1205.20]  Oh, well, hell yeah.
[1205.20 --> 1205.56]  I'm sorry.
[1205.64 --> 1205.92]  Good job.
[1205.94 --> 1206.74]  You want a discount?
[1206.84 --> 1208.04]  Cause we're getting less views.
[1209.32 --> 1209.72]  No.
[1213.28 --> 1217.36]  You didn't, you didn't get a, an up count when we got more views.
[1217.48 --> 1217.78]  I don't know.
[1217.82 --> 1217.96]  Whatever.
[1218.34 --> 1223.82]  Um, but yeah, it's, it's, if there's a, and the sponsors that we currently have can look
[1223.82 --> 1228.22]  at, you know, uh, referral rates that they had in the past and notice that like nothing
[1228.22 --> 1229.74]  really changed and then things are fine.
[1229.74 --> 1234.78]  But if you're a sponsor looking at a prospective channel, your surface level view of them is
[1234.78 --> 1236.36]  often their view count.
[1236.90 --> 1241.10]  Um, so if you, if you're looking around and trying to view things and you see a tech creator,
[1241.10 --> 1245.90]  which might have a higher percentage of people running ad block, it's going to look worse.
[1245.90 --> 1253.08]  This, this did hit all of YouTube, but it disproportionately hit more tech savvy audiences.
[1253.08 --> 1253.52]  Yeah.
[1253.60 --> 1258.48]  It doesn't necessarily mean tech specifically, but it does mean tech savvy audiences, makers,
[1258.48 --> 1263.32]  people who are going to modify their things more often are more likely to throw in something
[1263.32 --> 1269.44]  like an ad block, uh, than someone who doesn't even know that the like extensions for browsers
[1269.44 --> 1274.78]  even exist, which is a thing, which is a very significant proportion of the population.
[1275.34 --> 1280.50]  Um, and I w I just want to make it clear because there seem to be a lot of people who are still
[1280.50 --> 1283.32]  super confused about my stance on ad blocking.
[1283.32 --> 1284.88]  I don't use them.
[1285.48 --> 1291.48]  I have a policy internally here at work that we are not allowed to use them, uh, because
[1291.48 --> 1299.46]  it feels pretty hypocritical for us to, you know, make our livelihoods off of ads and not,
[1299.56 --> 1303.96]  you know, support the other channels and websites and services that we use in the same way that
[1303.96 --> 1305.10]  we expect to be supported.
[1305.62 --> 1310.80]  Um, but as far as, you know, whether other people should use ad block, uh, we have always
[1310.80 --> 1312.54]  said that that's a personal choice.
[1313.00 --> 1318.06]  Luke and I have always owned that there were times in our lives that we pirated all manners
[1318.06 --> 1321.44]  of different kinds of content, whether for financial reasons or otherwise.
[1322.08 --> 1326.26]  Um, and we, we've always maintained it's a, it's a personal choice.
[1326.26 --> 1332.78]  The only thing that I've ever asked people to consider is the very, very simple fact that
[1332.78 --> 1340.18]  ad blocking is circumventing the method of payment that exists, uh, for the content.
[1340.18 --> 1342.30]  So is functionally piracy.
[1342.52 --> 1345.86]  And you need to understand the impact of your actions.
[1346.04 --> 1351.72]  If you want the services and the content that you obviously enjoy enough to watch to exist,
[1351.72 --> 1357.30]  then you're either part of it continuing to exist or you're part of it not continuing
[1357.30 --> 1357.98]  to exist.
[1358.10 --> 1359.84]  And there could be an impact there.
[1359.98 --> 1361.00]  There might not be.
[1361.00 --> 1368.20]  We luckily have diversified our business in such a way that our revenues from LTT store,
[1368.30 --> 1375.18]  for instance, actually exceed now our revenues from, uh, like Google AdSense by a country mile.
[1375.74 --> 1380.48]  Um, but this is something that disproportionately impacts smaller creators.
[1380.48 --> 1385.66]  I mean, back when this viewpocalypse first hit, I was chatting with Dan about it after WAN show
[1385.66 --> 1390.50]  because Luke, you know, doesn't see fit to just even be in the office with us anymore.
[1390.96 --> 1395.08]  Um, so he wasn't part of the conversation, but, uh, Dan was saying that he'd spoken
[1395.08 --> 1399.54]  with a couple of small creators already who were basically like, yeah, I mean, if this,
[1400.04 --> 1404.90]  if this is it, if this is new normal, I'm back to my day job because this is not sustainable
[1404.90 --> 1405.42]  for me.
[1405.90 --> 1407.16]  It's going to destroy a lot of people.
[1407.16 --> 1412.46]  Non insignificant amount of people that reached out because they were like, I really hope you
[1412.46 --> 1416.50]  have some information because if you don't, I might be quitting this as a profession.
[1416.50 --> 1420.42]  That was a probably close to double digit amount of different creators.
[1420.68 --> 1421.40]  I'm not even kidding.
[1421.50 --> 1422.14]  Very large percentage.
[1422.14 --> 1424.84]  This was terrifying for people.
[1425.24 --> 1427.62]  It hit our niche harder than probably anyone.
[1428.16 --> 1430.06]  Um, or at least close to it.
[1430.06 --> 1433.26]  Um, yeah.
[1433.46 --> 1440.36]  And like the, the whole get good thing from, from YouTube, I can't be too mad about that.
[1440.40 --> 1440.70]  I get it.
[1440.70 --> 1442.42]  Sometimes honestly, they're just right.
[1442.50 --> 1442.64]  Yeah.
[1442.70 --> 1447.06]  And there are, it's a meritocracy mostly with asterisks.
[1448.36 --> 1448.76]  Yeah.
[1448.94 --> 1452.02]  And, and like, I, I honestly understand their response.
[1452.02 --> 1457.00]  At first I was kind of annoyed to be honest that it was buried in a blog post and it was
[1457.00 --> 1458.62]  buried at the bottom of a blog post and stuff.
[1458.62 --> 1463.56]  But they have an interesting problem because there are creators complaining about views
[1463.56 --> 1466.08]  right now that this didn't affect that much.
[1467.58 --> 1468.02]  Yeah.
[1468.02 --> 1469.58]  So how do they deal with this?
[1470.04 --> 1475.10]  Um, because if they say, oh, it was just ad block, then all those creators that didn't
[1475.10 --> 1479.40]  have a ton of ad blocking in their audiences might expect their views to come back.
[1479.72 --> 1479.84]  Yep.
[1480.00 --> 1482.16]  But they might not because they might need to get good.
[1482.98 --> 1483.46]  Yeah.
[1483.52 --> 1487.70]  So it's, it's tough because YouTube is YouTube as always.
[1487.70 --> 1490.52]  So you're competing against everyone all the time.
[1490.52 --> 1495.28]  Um, your niche is also competing against everyone like as a unit.
[1495.28 --> 1503.64]  Um, because if you get suddenly really interested in some rant, I don't know, uh, 3d printing,
[1503.64 --> 1504.94]  there's a 3d printer back there.
[1505.16 --> 1509.32]  Um, if you get really interested in 3d printing, you might get, uh, suggested other 3d printing
[1509.32 --> 1510.28]  channels as well.
[1510.28 --> 1514.68]  So like your, your niche is competing as a whole, your channel is competing as an individual.
[1514.68 --> 1520.96]  And if all of this isn't fighting really hard for eyeballs, you're going to start falling
[1520.96 --> 1521.32]  behind.
[1521.32 --> 1526.26]  And like, it's, it's amazing how much people's interest in things can change over time.
[1526.26 --> 1529.06]  Take for example, help with mortgage.
[1530.04 --> 1530.18]  Okay.
[1530.28 --> 1536.86]  This is an interest that obviously spiked, you know, after the 2008 financial crisis.
[1536.86 --> 1542.56]  And to the point that, uh, Luke and I have been talking about recently, how we're sort
[1542.56 --> 1545.92]  of terrified about what things are looking like economically right now.
[1546.46 --> 1554.32]  It has spiked again to the greatest interest in Google search results literally ever, um,
[1554.44 --> 1555.26]  last month.
[1557.94 --> 1563.30]  Sorry to, sorry to flash bang you guys with, Oh my God, what is going on right now?
[1563.30 --> 1568.00]  Um, yeah, there's some, I know I've heard some counters to that.
[1568.10 --> 1571.56]  I think it's legit, but some people are saying there's just more people on the internet than
[1571.56 --> 1572.20]  there were before.
[1572.96 --> 1577.48]  Um, I mean that could account for part of it, but I don't think that accounts for the changes
[1577.48 --> 1579.26]  since like July of 2019.
[1579.90 --> 1584.32]  One really interesting thing is if you look up foreclosure, it's not doing the same thing,
[1584.32 --> 1588.10]  which makes me think that we are in the pre times.
[1588.52 --> 1588.64]  Yeah.
[1588.64 --> 1593.36]  Um, well they say you can't, you can't know if you were in a recession until something like
[1593.36 --> 1596.60]  a year after it started or something like that.
[1597.04 --> 1604.48]  Um, uh, anyway, all I know is I was talking to the LTT store team about the plan for Black
[1604.48 --> 1605.46]  Friday, Cyber Monday.
[1605.56 --> 1611.38]  And I was like, Hey guys, this could be, this could be a hurrah.
[1611.64 --> 1616.46]  I don't want to say last hurrah because I think we're going to survive to hurrah again, but
[1616.46 --> 1622.44]  it may be, it may be one of our only hurrah opportunities for a little while until, uh,
[1622.56 --> 1625.12]  until things kind of settle.
[1625.86 --> 1626.66]  Uh, yeah.
[1626.70 --> 1633.62]  I mean, I had a, I had a conversation with someone recently about, um, they're saying,
[1633.70 --> 1637.86]  they're talking about how like their viewership is still high, but their conversions on things
[1637.86 --> 1643.24]  are going down and they were wondering why.
[1643.24 --> 1647.10]  And I had the conversation about the, um, insufficient funds error that we had been seeing.
[1647.20 --> 1653.14]  And it was a, it was like kind of a, a dark convo because like, like what you're saying,
[1653.18 --> 1655.22]  this might, this might be a hurrah of sorts.
[1655.36 --> 1656.84]  It's like, yeah, if the people don't have-
[1656.84 --> 1656.86]  Hold on.
[1656.86 --> 1661.52]  For context, if you didn't watch that previous WAN show, uh, Luke and I discussed how, um,
[1661.52 --> 1668.58]  there has been a significant, measurable, noticeable, statistically significant uptick in people's
[1668.58 --> 1676.12]  non-renewals of float plane being due to the specific error, insufficient funds, which we
[1676.12 --> 1683.24]  laid out very clearly is not something that we want people going through to support us on float plane.
[1683.76 --> 1689.04]  We absolutely value your support, but if it's that tight, then we'd rather you buy food.
[1690.04 --> 1690.10]  Okay.
[1690.18 --> 1691.98]  And you can, you can chart it out over time.
[1691.98 --> 1693.98]  Um, the, the error rate goes like this.
[1694.38 --> 1694.78]  Yep.
[1695.28 --> 1696.00]  Um, so.
[1696.50 --> 1697.12]  Almost like this.
[1697.12 --> 1698.94]  Yeah, but it, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1698.94 --> 1702.14]  To be honest, I bet you it tracks that pretty accurately.
[1702.60 --> 1702.84]  Um.
[1702.88 --> 1703.60]  So anyway, yeah, sorry.
[1703.70 --> 1704.10]  Carry on.
[1704.16 --> 1705.40]  You were having the dark conversation.
[1705.94 --> 1706.28]  No, yeah.
[1706.28 --> 1710.14]  But part of the conversation was like, Hey, I mean, if there isn't money out there, like
[1710.14 --> 1713.52]  if the, if the people don't have funds, they can't support you.
[1713.52 --> 1718.12]  And we, we got into the conversation of like, where is it going first?
[1718.84 --> 1726.68]  Um, and, and credit cards, housing, food.
[1726.84 --> 1728.64]  It's been a rough time to be a canary.
[1729.60 --> 1730.08]  Yeah.
[1730.56 --> 1731.00]  Yeah.
[1731.80 --> 1732.24]  Yeah.
[1732.24 --> 1734.76]  Jonathan, Jonathan posted in, in float plane chat.
[1734.82 --> 1736.42]  He said, canaries are dying left and right.
[1736.48 --> 1740.54]  It's like, yeah, it says, I mean, these are, these are some of the first things to go, right?
[1740.54 --> 1743.88]  Like entertainment usually does pretty well in recessions.
[1744.34 --> 1744.70]  Um.
[1744.70 --> 1749.74]  However, I feel like the way people spend on entertainment is really different.
[1749.74 --> 1755.24]  Like when we talk about entertainment as being kind of recession proof, uh, one of the main
[1755.24 --> 1759.04]  industries where this comes up is, is the cinema, right?
[1759.36 --> 1759.54]  Yeah.
[1759.54 --> 1765.56]  But cinema expenses are kind of like, uh, they're a night out, you know, they're, they're, they're
[1765.56 --> 1767.46]  a splurge item at any, at any point.
[1767.56 --> 1767.82]  Right.
[1767.82 --> 1774.38]  And people do tend to still want to kind of treat myself once in a while, even when times
[1774.38 --> 1777.90]  are pretty tight and a movie, you know, a night at the movies, huh?
[1778.22 --> 1783.28]  I mean, these days it's a little different, but a night at the movies used to be like a
[1783.28 --> 1788.22]  pretty affordable treat myself, you know, whether it's a date or whether it's taking the kids
[1788.22 --> 1792.58]  out and catching a few Z's at the matinee or, you know, whatever it is, it was relatively
[1792.58 --> 1793.14]  affordable.
[1793.14 --> 1800.26]  Um, whereas now the way that we're talking about spending on entertainment, uh, some,
[1800.42 --> 1805.08]  you know, I personally think the LTT screwdriver is a great tool that, you know, you should
[1805.08 --> 1808.44]  just buy if you need a fantastic screwdriver with the trust me bro warranty.
[1808.44 --> 1811.38]  But for a lot of people, that's like a $70.
[1811.92 --> 1813.58]  I want to support this channel expense.
[1813.98 --> 1818.94]  You know, it comes down to sort of how people are making that decision or it could be a five
[1818.94 --> 1824.90]  or a $10 a month subscription for behind the scenes and early access, like on float plane.
[1825.22 --> 1829.54]  Uh, I'm not singling out other creators just cause I want to use ourselves as the example
[1829.54 --> 1829.84]  here.
[1829.94 --> 1838.08]  Uh, but there's lots of ways that the creator economy, um, asks a lot more from you than
[1838.08 --> 1839.84]  necessarily a night at the movies.
[1839.84 --> 1841.86]  And it's a different kind of rationale.
[1842.24 --> 1848.54]  Like if times are tight, I might continue to spend a bunch of money on OnlyFans.
[1848.66 --> 1852.88]  But if I am boy, is that ever terrible prioritization?
[1853.48 --> 1856.78]  I honestly suspect that might be one of the last things to go for a lot of people.
[1856.92 --> 1857.28]  Okay.
[1857.34 --> 1857.76]  I'm sorry.
[1857.86 --> 1858.46]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1858.52 --> 1859.16]  I even brought it up.
[1859.20 --> 1860.44]  I didn't want to hear you say that.
[1861.46 --> 1862.22]  Really dude.
[1862.88 --> 1867.18]  Although, although, although I do think that there will be a bit of a K shape to it.
[1867.48 --> 1873.76]  I think that the top creators are probably going to be the ones that survive while the,
[1873.76 --> 1881.04]  you know, the other like 98% that were just barely sort of scraping by on the platform
[1881.04 --> 1884.62]  or doing it part time, those are probably going to be the ones that are more impacted.
[1885.32 --> 1889.72]  That does tend to be the way things go is consolidation in these times.
[1890.66 --> 1894.68]  If I can throw my theory out there, it might differ slightly.
[1894.68 --> 1896.84]  And I could be super wrong here.
[1897.24 --> 1899.94]  Um, but it might differ slightly because.
[1904.44 --> 1904.92]  Sorry.
[1905.04 --> 1907.80]  I just saw LMG community said the bottom craters pun intended.
[1907.80 --> 1913.02]  That's, that's, are you, are you a Ross or are you a Joey?
[1914.40 --> 1920.52]  Um, but what I was going to say is I suspect some people are using that platform for companionship
[1920.52 --> 1921.08]  at this point.
[1921.56 --> 1928.74]  And anyone that feels like they have a connection with the person, however, obviously fake, um,
[1929.34 --> 1930.54]  is going to hold onto that.
[1934.00 --> 1934.74]  That's the yikes.
[1934.74 --> 1940.36]  Um, anyway, did you want us to show these, these lovely graphs, Dan, and bring things
[1940.36 --> 1941.12]  back on topic?
[1941.28 --> 1943.26]  Or do we want to talk more about?
[1943.50 --> 1945.64]  Also, do you have anything to add about the adpocalypse stuff?
[1946.60 --> 1948.02]  Not particularly at the moment.
[1948.10 --> 1949.38]  It's all a bit confusing.
[1950.04 --> 1950.40]  Um.
[1950.76 --> 1951.12]  Nice.
[1951.64 --> 1952.00]  Yeah.
[1952.48 --> 1954.16]  Well, a big part of the confusing is.
[1954.38 --> 1955.66]  Have they been committed?
[1955.78 --> 1956.56]  Have they been removed?
[1956.66 --> 1957.22]  Is it UBO?
[1957.38 --> 1957.94]  Is it temporary?
[1958.10 --> 1958.54]  Is it not?
[1958.54 --> 1962.08]  There's like an internal debate for these block lists.
[1962.08 --> 1964.10]  And are we even fully back?
[1964.76 --> 1965.20]  Um.
[1965.30 --> 1965.82]  I don't know.
[1965.98 --> 1966.84]  Cause it's hard to say.
[1966.96 --> 1970.54]  There's a pretty strong argument for us only being partially back.
[1970.72 --> 1971.00]  Yeah.
[1971.02 --> 1971.94]  Like have a look at this.
[1972.50 --> 1979.22]  So here's where we see the decoupling of our typical tracking between desktop and mobile
[1979.22 --> 1979.80]  views.
[1980.04 --> 1982.16]  Uh, so that's blue and green here.
[1982.16 --> 1986.38]  So here's the viewpocalypse where desktop views go.
[1987.14 --> 1988.26]  See you later, buddy.
[1988.52 --> 1989.62]  August 10th, August 11th.
[1989.66 --> 1989.88]  Yep.
[1990.08 --> 1994.18]  And then they're still, I mean, they're still not here.
[1994.66 --> 2001.40]  And I don't believe that the LTT audience just like suddenly stopped using computers as
[2001.40 --> 2001.70]  much.
[2001.92 --> 2007.16]  One thing is, um, we may have been basically removed from the algorithm, right?
[2007.26 --> 2008.68]  Suddenly we're not getting any views.
[2008.68 --> 2010.72]  So, okay.
[2010.96 --> 2018.66]  So I actually chatted with a fairly senior, uh, member of YouTube over that topic, um,
[2018.70 --> 2019.14]  yesterday.
[2019.28 --> 2024.56]  Cause I, it occurred to me, um, in, in our dashboard, for instance, a lot of the time it'll
[2024.56 --> 2029.28]  say things like, Hey, this video is getting a lot of views because it appealed to your core
[2029.28 --> 2029.64]  audience.
[2029.64 --> 2031.44]  So it's like gaining extra reach.
[2031.44 --> 2039.18]  And I was like, so, um, if our views aren't tracking properly, does that impact the likelihood
[2039.18 --> 2046.20]  of our videos being suggested and gaining virality since they'll be recorded as low view videos?
[2046.60 --> 2049.64]  And it was explained to me.
[2049.96 --> 2056.12]  Um, and you know, you have to always take everything, you know, not with a grain of salt,
[2056.12 --> 2059.08]  because this is someone that I believe would be very honest with me.
[2059.08 --> 2061.50]  So I'm not saying that there's any sort of distrust.
[2062.10 --> 2066.92]  Um, but you have to take everything through the lens of the person who's delivering it.
[2067.14 --> 2075.14]  And their lens is as someone who, who, who works in raw numbers and who is, who is, who,
[2075.50 --> 2080.68]  if you cut them open would bleed red, but like YouTube, you know?
[2080.68 --> 2086.84]  Uh, so they're, they're, they're, they're very, they're very, you know, pro the platform
[2086.84 --> 2091.60]  and, and justifiably so they work hard to make it in my opinion.
[2091.60 --> 2092.82]  This is my opinion.
[2092.82 --> 2097.60]  Now the best video platform on the internet, full stop period.
[2097.76 --> 2099.84]  YouTube is a technological Marvel.
[2100.08 --> 2104.18]  I have called it the whatever it wonder of the world many times.
[2104.18 --> 2110.48]  I think it is, I think it has all the importance of like the library of Alexandria in terms of
[2110.48 --> 2114.78]  the, the wealth of human knowledge and humanity that it contains.
[2115.14 --> 2119.22]  I love YouTube as a whole.
[2119.78 --> 2121.34]  It doesn't mean I love everything about it.
[2121.38 --> 2125.70]  And it doesn't mean that I can take absolutely everything that someone from YouTube says just
[2125.70 --> 2126.86]  through my own lens.
[2126.94 --> 2128.10]  It comes through their lens.
[2128.10 --> 2134.30]  So what they reminded me is that those little messages in the dashboard do have to be dumbed
[2134.30 --> 2139.64]  down a fair bit to make it easy for the lowest common denominator YouTuber to understand.
[2139.92 --> 2147.30]  And also that the recommendation system is really centered around individual viewers, not
[2147.30 --> 2148.20]  around creators.
[2148.96 --> 2155.06]  When you upload a video, YouTube doesn't go, Oh, there's some juicy new content.
[2155.06 --> 2158.34]  Instead, how can I get viewers to come look at it?
[2159.80 --> 2161.34]  Instead, it works the other way.
[2161.54 --> 2167.04]  When you log on to YouTube, YouTube goes, Ooh, a juicy new viewer.
[2167.58 --> 2168.62]  What will they watch?
[2168.74 --> 2173.12]  And it goes and it finds things from its content library and it, and it serves it to them.
[2173.18 --> 2173.76]  It feeds them.
[2174.44 --> 2183.50]  So with that in mind, if somebody is consistently using an ad blocker, then that will skew their
[2183.50 --> 2188.34]  consumption recommendation relationship with the YouTube algorithm.
[2188.34 --> 2191.36]  And yes, Luke, I know exactly where you're going with this.
[2191.66 --> 2194.88]  What if there are certain channels that they predominantly watch on desktop?
[2195.58 --> 2200.00]  And that's where, you know, them having their YouTube hat means that they're not going to
[2200.00 --> 2205.48]  necessarily think about or care that much about that being kind of a big deal to someone
[2205.48 --> 2207.12]  like me, for instance.
[2207.12 --> 2212.34]  Because there are certain types of content that I'm way more likely to watch on TV and
[2212.34 --> 2215.40]  certain types of content that I'm way more likely to watch on my phone.
[2215.92 --> 2221.60]  Like you might watch, if you were into football, you might watch NFL content on your TV more than
[2221.60 --> 2223.40]  more than pretty much any other device.
[2223.40 --> 2226.70]  Cause that's where that has been normalized for you over time.
[2226.76 --> 2231.28]  If you're on your computer thinking about computer stuff, you might be more likely to
[2231.28 --> 2232.48]  watch tech content.
[2233.02 --> 2236.38]  These are assumptions, but I think they're fairly rational.
[2236.38 --> 2237.64]  Yes.
[2238.88 --> 2241.30]  Anyway, that's enough inside baseball for today.
[2241.30 --> 2242.88]  I think let's talk about.
[2244.36 --> 2254.18]  Nvidia investing $5 billion into Intel, which seems to be the, the, the, the very bad news
[2254.18 --> 2255.94]  for one AMD.
[2256.28 --> 2262.98]  Although AMD has been kicking enough butt over the last five years that I'm, I'm kind of
[2262.98 --> 2263.24]  interested.
[2263.34 --> 2264.84]  I'm kind of interested to see the showdown.
[2264.84 --> 2267.42]  Anyway, let's, let's get into the details.
[2267.42 --> 2273.38]  Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel's common stock as part of a plan to jointly develop
[2273.38 --> 2276.72]  AI infrastructure and personal computing products.
[2276.96 --> 2286.18]  So it's been talked about endlessly how Nvidia would love to be a CPU company, right?
[2286.18 --> 2287.82]  They tried to acquire arm.
[2288.44 --> 2294.60]  There was, there's always been sort of rumor mill scuttlebutt about them, you know, wishing
[2294.60 --> 2301.08]  they had an x86 license and, and thinking like, Hey, we're a fabulous GPU manufacturer.
[2301.08 --> 2303.74]  Why shouldn't we be a fabulous CPU manufacturer?
[2304.54 --> 2312.10]  Um, well, this might be the way for them to get in rather than acquiring an x86 license,
[2312.10 --> 2317.38]  which to my understanding, no one, but Intel or AMD or man, who's the last one?
[2317.38 --> 2323.92]  Was it a via that still had one, but then that became Centaur, but then that maybe is deprecated.
[2324.26 --> 2324.94]  I don't know.
[2325.02 --> 2327.66]  There, there, there was, there was a third, something like that.
[2327.92 --> 2331.30]  There was another, uh, but basically it's just Intel and AMD.
[2331.30 --> 2337.78]  And my understanding is both of them have no ability to, to sell or assign or otherwise
[2337.78 --> 2345.08]  grant their x86 license to anyone else, uh, because they basically decided, Hmm, you know,
[2345.10 --> 2350.08]  it'd be better than, you know, everyone else being able to compete being a duopoly.
[2351.66 --> 2355.54]  That was legal, uh, for reasons that I'm sure make sense to someone.
[2355.54 --> 2360.48]  Uh, anyway, the point is that there, there was no, this could be the way for NVIDIA to
[2360.48 --> 2368.78]  gain access to Intel's x86 license, the access to the ability to build x86 based products
[2368.78 --> 2372.04]  without actually acquiring it.
[2372.44 --> 2373.98]  Um, fascinating.
[2374.30 --> 2380.86]  So Intel says it will design and manufacture custom data center and client x86 CPUs with
[2380.86 --> 2384.04]  NVIDIA NVLink as it's part of the deal.
[2384.04 --> 2384.44]  Okay.
[2385.08 --> 2389.36]  That's pretty cool because NVLink is kind of badass.
[2390.42 --> 2395.96]  Like, and in the data center, like you think of the benchmarks that you do on a CPU that
[2395.96 --> 2397.44]  you care about as a gamer, right?
[2397.44 --> 2402.04]  Like how many FPS do I get in this game or how many Cinebench render points do I get?
[2402.14 --> 2406.18]  Or how fast can I calculate, you know, pie in the data center?
[2406.18 --> 2414.24]  The actual raw performance of your CPU cores is far, far less impactful in many cases than
[2414.24 --> 2421.02]  the speed of your interconnects and how quickly you can get access to other resources within
[2421.02 --> 2422.88]  the rack or within the data center.
[2423.38 --> 2426.96]  NVLink is kind of flipping goaded.
[2426.96 --> 2428.12]  Yeah.
[2428.56 --> 2430.66]  This is, this is pretty cool.
[2431.24 --> 2432.44]  Um, okay.
[2433.36 --> 2439.52]  Client CPUs will be x86 SOCs with NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets.
[2439.52 --> 2443.34]  Do you guys remember?
[2443.88 --> 2448.62]  Luke, do you remember that Intel Nook that had an Intel?
[2448.62 --> 2449.70]  Oh my God.
[2450.18 --> 2451.72]  Do you remember that Intel Nook?
[2451.92 --> 2457.08]  So remember when Intel made those little micro PCs that Intel Nook that had an Intel CPU
[2457.08 --> 2460.56]  and an AMD GPU on the same package?
[2460.84 --> 2461.38]  Oh yeah.
[2461.64 --> 2465.68]  That like unholy Satan spawn of an SOC.
[2465.68 --> 2467.82]  It was pretty cool.
[2468.00 --> 2472.88]  And that was at a time that AMD's GPU technology was really not keeping up.
[2474.06 --> 2478.68]  Intel CPU plus NVIDIA GPU on a single chip?
[2479.18 --> 2483.04]  Or sorry, the word chip has a lot of room for interpretation here.
[2483.26 --> 2484.60]  On a single package?
[2484.78 --> 2485.64]  Package, yeah.
[2485.70 --> 2486.18]  Woo!
[2486.78 --> 2487.08]  Woo!
[2488.22 --> 2491.66]  Java Juice pointed this out, but handhelds, that could be interesting.
[2492.06 --> 2492.52]  Yeah.
[2492.52 --> 2496.68]  I mean, to be clear, ARK, pretty good.
[2497.52 --> 2497.76]  Yes.
[2497.90 --> 2499.82]  Is NVIDIA's GPU tech a little better?
[2500.24 --> 2500.54]  Y'all.
[2501.54 --> 2505.00]  Dude, if I could freaking, if I could have, oh man.
[2505.56 --> 2509.60]  Like, Intel's last gen mobile chips are actually super efficient.
[2509.80 --> 2515.00]  It's just like, it's hard to care about them right now when their desktops are so far behind.
[2515.00 --> 2521.42]  And, you know, they're losing their lead in server market share for the first time ever.
[2521.54 --> 2524.28]  And like, there's all this like, terrible, terrible news coming out of Intel.
[2524.44 --> 2529.02]  But their last gen notebook chips are actually like, pretty damn decent.
[2529.52 --> 2536.60]  And so if we could take that performance and efficiency, throw like a latest gen NVIDIA GPU on it.
[2536.60 --> 2538.60]  Like, man, you look at, look at Switch 2.
[2539.10 --> 2541.02]  Look at how flippin' efficient that thing is.
[2541.14 --> 2542.34]  How skinny it is.
[2542.64 --> 2544.42]  How little cooling it needs.
[2544.76 --> 2546.72]  And yeah, there are definitely issues with it.
[2546.76 --> 2549.46]  I wish it had the same battery life as the Switch OLED, for instance.
[2549.56 --> 2550.70]  But it doesn't.
[2551.26 --> 2555.20]  And for what it is, like, man, is it ever a pretty cool little device.
[2555.42 --> 2555.62]  Yeah.
[2555.86 --> 2557.96]  That's based on old GPUs.
[2558.30 --> 2561.02]  Whereas like, because that's, that's Nintendo's way.
[2561.40 --> 2564.00]  It's like, I don't know, give us whatever you were throwing away anyway.
[2564.00 --> 2566.10]  You know, come on, Nintendo.
[2566.90 --> 2571.30]  But if you were an Asus or an MSI or something like that, for instance, and you were building
[2571.30 --> 2579.80]  a new PC handheld with, oh, I don't know, maybe the new Windows interface that's supposed
[2579.80 --> 2586.78]  to be debuting on the upcoming Xbox Ally X ROG, whatever the thing is called.
[2587.18 --> 2587.92]  We've got it.
[2587.94 --> 2588.28]  We've got it.
[2588.28 --> 2589.80]  We're going to be playing around with it later on the show.
[2590.08 --> 2592.96]  Like, with the latest gen tech, dude.
[2592.96 --> 2596.00]  Ah, I love handheld gaming.
[2596.24 --> 2599.22]  So I'm very excited for this, if that wasn't already clear.
[2599.32 --> 2606.02]  Anyway, we are just weeks past the U.S. government making an $8.9 billion investment into Intel
[2606.02 --> 2611.28]  common stock, which was roughly a 10% stake, which means, and this blows my mind, Intel
[2611.28 --> 2616.86]  is now 15% owned by two entities, the U.S. government and NVIDIA.
[2616.86 --> 2619.08]  The last two I would have thought.
[2623.32 --> 2624.60]  It's wild, man.
[2625.40 --> 2630.50]  In a joint webcast, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang claimed that their deal has nothing to do
[2630.50 --> 2631.46]  with the U.S. government.
[2631.76 --> 2635.52]  I wouldn't blame him for distancing himself a little bit from some of the controversy around
[2635.52 --> 2637.80]  that particular transaction.
[2637.80 --> 2644.10]  And AP News reported that the 23% stock growth represents Intel's largest one-day gain since,
[2644.52 --> 2647.80]  and this is not a typo, 1987.
[2649.38 --> 2650.02]  Yeah.
[2650.88 --> 2655.24]  Anyone like extreme long-holding Intel is maybe pretty stoked right now.
[2655.50 --> 2656.14]  Yeah.
[2656.58 --> 2659.52]  Stoked that maybe one day they could get back what they paid.
[2659.52 --> 2663.92]  Will this deal involve manufacturing chips in the U.S.?
[2663.92 --> 2664.58]  That's unclear.
[2664.76 --> 2668.30]  Both CEOs wouldn't say anything concrete regarding this.
[2669.62 --> 2670.06]  What?
[2670.48 --> 2670.66]  What?
[2672.14 --> 2673.22]  I don't think I...
[2673.22 --> 2673.84]  He had a thunk.
[2675.72 --> 2676.12]  Okay.
[2676.76 --> 2677.28]  It's gone.
[2678.16 --> 2680.60]  I wonder if this is related to that thing I'm going to go do.
[2681.34 --> 2682.02]  I don't know.
[2682.46 --> 2683.98]  I don't even know what thing you're going to do.
[2684.84 --> 2685.24]  Luke.
[2685.32 --> 2686.44]  I don't know if I can talk about it.
[2686.52 --> 2687.92]  You're so vague posty right now.
[2688.02 --> 2688.90]  I told you, though.
[2688.90 --> 2689.58]  Do you remember?
[2690.24 --> 2692.18]  Can you rack the...
[2692.18 --> 2693.02]  Can I rack?
[2693.40 --> 2695.70]  It doesn't matter, because I can't say it, so...
[2695.70 --> 2701.38]  Anyways.
[2702.34 --> 2702.82]  Anyway.
[2704.10 --> 2709.12]  Interestingly, recent reports have suggested that NVIDIA could release an ARM-based APU-powered laptop
[2709.12 --> 2710.38]  within the next couple of quarters.
[2711.20 --> 2715.30]  Actually, a recent report suggested that NVIDIA was supposed to release that, like, ages ago,
[2715.34 --> 2716.56]  but that's a whole separate conversation.
[2716.56 --> 2719.32]  And the Verge's Sean Hollister put it aptly.
[2719.84 --> 2723.46]  NVIDIA and Intel basically said they're going to eat AMD's lunch.
[2723.52 --> 2726.86]  And that is in reference to Jensen on the joint call saying,
[2726.86 --> 2731.52]  there is an entire segment of the market where the CPU and GPU are integrated,
[2731.98 --> 2736.50]  and it's for form factor reasons, or cost reasons, or battery life reasons, all kinds of reasons,
[2736.74 --> 2740.58]  and that segment has been largely unaddressed by NVIDIA today.
[2743.42 --> 2744.26]  APUs, anyone?
[2744.26 --> 2745.64]  Oh boy.
[2745.64 --> 2748.86]  Intel told PC World the deal won't affect its roadmap,
[2749.16 --> 2752.72]  and specifically said they will continue to have GPU product offerings,
[2753.24 --> 2757.36]  which, unfortunately, does not specifically confirm that ARK,
[2758.62 --> 2760.46]  notably discrete ARK,
[2760.94 --> 2762.70]  which I am really rooting for,
[2762.98 --> 2766.54]  will continue to be that GPU offering.
[2766.54 --> 2772.06]  Reuters reports that some analysts have suggested this may be the first step in an Intel takeover or breakup.
[2772.36 --> 2774.44]  I actually am not sure that I agree with that.
[2774.50 --> 2775.26]  If anything, I would think...
[2775.26 --> 2775.88]  I don't think so.
[2775.92 --> 2779.92]  The U.S. government and NVIDIA are both stepping in to prevent that.
[2780.60 --> 2781.14]  I think so.
[2781.24 --> 2782.22]  Is my read on this.
[2782.68 --> 2784.28]  This is not the same thing,
[2784.36 --> 2788.06]  but it feels like tangentially related to when Microsoft invested in Apple.
[2788.06 --> 2793.40]  I think the tech industry wants Intel to stick around.
[2794.42 --> 2797.12]  The tech industry is healthier when Intel is healthy.
[2797.58 --> 2799.32]  There is no question.
[2800.08 --> 2802.40]  No question of that whatsoever.
[2803.06 --> 2809.60]  And if NVIDIA can find a way to help keep them around in a way that benefits themselves,
[2809.96 --> 2812.16]  it makes a lot of sense for them to do that.
[2812.28 --> 2812.38]  Yep.
[2812.38 --> 2815.00]  So this, honestly, when I read this,
[2815.30 --> 2819.36]  this was like one of the things in the tech industry that made the most sense to me in a long time.
[2819.80 --> 2821.68]  So, yeah, I think it's cool.
[2821.72 --> 2825.16]  I really, really hope that ARK continues to exist.
[2825.74 --> 2829.32]  I don't think that's going to be a problem here, personally,
[2829.88 --> 2831.32]  but I hope it exists.
[2831.64 --> 2835.24]  Should we make this into a weekly segment called
[2835.24 --> 2838.44]  Is ARK in Stock at MSRP and Should You Buy One?
[2839.62 --> 2840.52]  I like that.
[2840.70 --> 2840.98]  Yeah.
[2841.12 --> 2841.92]  I think that's cool.
[2841.92 --> 2842.68]  Look at this.
[2842.74 --> 2845.94]  Because, dude, even using them for lossless frame gen and stuff like that,
[2846.02 --> 2847.54]  like, they are really cool.
[2847.94 --> 2848.60]  Here it is.
[2849.12 --> 2851.60]  New way, sorted by, featured, you know what?
[2851.64 --> 2852.72]  Let's sort by lowest price.
[2852.94 --> 2854.48]  Intel ARK B580.
[2855.04 --> 2856.00]  Tremendous GPU.
[2856.48 --> 2857.22]  Great GPU.
[2857.80 --> 2858.86]  Now in stock.
[2858.94 --> 2862.62]  You could get an Intel reference card for $249.99
[2862.62 --> 2864.80]  with free shipping in the United States.
[2865.06 --> 2868.84]  You could get an Onyx Odyssey for $249.99.
[2869.28 --> 2871.24]  Also free shipping in the United States.
[2871.24 --> 2875.24]  If you're partial to ASRock and you want an open box Steel Legend,
[2875.42 --> 2879.20]  you could get that for $259 with free shipping in the United States.
[2879.20 --> 2883.34]  Oh, this one is only showing gray here because I actually have it in my cart.
[2883.68 --> 2885.18]  Here's the exact same card.
[2885.62 --> 2888.96]  Not open box for the same price.
[2889.20 --> 2890.56]  Oh, but you have to pay for shipping.
[2890.70 --> 2890.94]  Okay.
[2891.02 --> 2891.30]  All right.
[2891.34 --> 2891.78]  Well, whatever.
[2891.78 --> 2895.10]  Onyx Lumi is $269.
[2895.46 --> 2895.72]  Okay.
[2895.76 --> 2896.78]  Now we're getting past.
[2896.86 --> 2898.82]  Oh, here's a three fan version for $269.
[2899.00 --> 2899.80]  That's pretty good.
[2899.86 --> 2900.34]  That's pretty good.
[2900.34 --> 2901.44]  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[2901.52 --> 2903.10]  This is the triple fan and the dual fan.
[2903.40 --> 2910.64]  So you can get the triple fan for $259 open box with free shipping or $269 not open box
[2910.64 --> 2911.50]  with free shipping.
[2911.50 --> 2919.86]  I just want to check and see if they still have that cool Intel Days game promotion going
[2919.86 --> 2923.46]  right now because they were actually giving away the new Battlefield with these.
[2923.78 --> 2926.26]  I don't see it, unfortunately.
[2926.64 --> 2929.74]  But hey, it's still a great deal.
[2929.74 --> 2935.22]  It's a great GPU at a fair price and it's at MSRP.
[2935.22 --> 2942.24]  So if you or anyone you know is looking for a GPU right now, you've got $250 to spend.
[2942.62 --> 2948.94]  The ARC-B580 can be yours and it will not only give you a very satisfactory gaming experience
[2948.94 --> 2956.10]  in all but some pretty isolated edge cases where, okay, they've only been doing this a
[2956.10 --> 2956.52]  few years.
[2956.52 --> 2963.42]  But it will also hopefully help us make sure that, oh my God, we have another option for
[2963.42 --> 2964.20]  GPUs.
[2965.10 --> 2965.24]  Yeah.
[2967.36 --> 2969.16]  Someone says, look at the one in your cart.
[2971.06 --> 2972.00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[2972.06 --> 2972.28]  Okay.
[2972.30 --> 2974.54]  That would have been a way for me to check the promotion.
[2975.36 --> 2980.84]  And no, it looks like, unfortunately, the Battlefield promotion is no longer here.
[2980.90 --> 2981.74]  What was it called?
[2982.36 --> 2984.70]  It was called Intel Days or something like that.
[2986.52 --> 2988.82]  Can't remember exactly what it's called.
[2988.86 --> 2989.64]  Oh, this is crazy.
[2989.74 --> 2990.30]  Check this out.
[2990.70 --> 2991.14]  Check this out.
[2991.64 --> 2995.04]  70 plus people have this cart in their cart right now.
[2995.64 --> 2999.00]  There is no way that that is not because of WAN Show right now.
[2999.96 --> 3001.28]  That is hilarious.
[3002.54 --> 3003.08]  Hold on.
[3003.80 --> 3004.16]  Oh, wait.
[3004.24 --> 3004.76]  No, hold on.
[3006.38 --> 3006.76]  There.
[3006.76 --> 3010.24]  Intel Gamer Days 2025 Battlefield 6 bundle.
[3010.38 --> 3012.16]  Giving myself full credit here for that.
[3012.62 --> 3017.52]  Single-handedly selling more ARC-B580s than anyone else on the internet.
[3018.28 --> 3019.32]  I'm quite sure of it.
[3020.02 --> 3026.16]  It was called the thing that I just said, Intel Gamer Days 2025 Battlefield 6 bundle.
[3026.38 --> 3028.70]  It went from August 25th to September 14th.
[3028.70 --> 3029.20]  So it's done.
[3029.62 --> 3030.16]  Yeah, bummer.
[3030.78 --> 3031.10]  Still.
[3031.46 --> 3031.80]  Dude.
[3031.94 --> 3032.76]  That was a wicked bundle.
[3033.38 --> 3034.28]  Dude, the top one?
[3035.28 --> 3036.26]  This is crazy.
[3037.76 --> 3038.88]  What the heck?
[3040.00 --> 3040.68]  Oh, man.
[3040.80 --> 3041.56]  This is fun.
[3041.74 --> 3042.24]  This is fun.
[3042.34 --> 3042.76]  Let's play.
[3042.86 --> 3043.30]  Let's play.
[3043.48 --> 3046.36]  How many GPUs can we sell on WAN Show today?
[3047.98 --> 3051.76]  To be clear, Newegg is not the only place that you could buy an ARC.
[3051.80 --> 3054.14]  I have no particular loyalty to Newegg.
[3054.68 --> 3056.38]  The reference card, dude?
[3057.30 --> 3057.74]  Wow.
[3058.66 --> 3060.08]  I wonder what's up with that.
[3060.54 --> 3061.42]  That's interesting.
[3062.26 --> 3062.68]  Okay.
[3062.68 --> 3062.80]  Okay.
[3063.50 --> 3063.94]  Okay.
[3064.08 --> 3065.52]  I do want to know, though.
[3065.78 --> 3066.58]  I want to know.
[3066.70 --> 3068.00]  I'm going to ping.
[3068.16 --> 3068.50]  Oh, man.
[3068.52 --> 3069.76]  I should have used our affiliate code.
[3069.82 --> 3071.18]  I think we have an affiliate code.
[3071.34 --> 3071.68]  Damn it.
[3072.26 --> 3072.60]  Whatever.
[3072.90 --> 3076.26]  The point is, I'm going to message Colton.
[3076.38 --> 3081.94]  I'm going to ask him to message our Newegg contacts and see if we sold a crap ton of ARCs today.
[3082.66 --> 3083.60]  That's hilarious.
[3083.60 --> 3087.54]  Well, and whenever we talked about Gamer Days.
[3089.08 --> 3090.34]  A huge spike.
[3090.42 --> 3091.28]  That would also be interesting.
[3091.42 --> 3096.78]  ARC and B sales at 11 a.m. Pacific today.
[3096.78 --> 3097.18]  Okay.
[3097.18 --> 3097.42]  Okay.
[3097.52 --> 3097.70]  Yeah.
[3098.00 --> 3098.90]  I'll find out.
[3098.96 --> 3099.52]  I'll find out.
[3099.64 --> 3100.52]  I'm curious.
[3100.78 --> 3101.04]  Anywho.
[3101.64 --> 3103.28]  Why don't we move on to...
[3103.28 --> 3103.66]  Oh, yeah.
[3103.72 --> 3107.44]  Is there anything else you wanted to talk about with respect to the NVIDIA Intel investment?
[3107.62 --> 3109.62]  I think this is one of those...
[3109.62 --> 3110.56]  It remains to be seen.
[3110.56 --> 3115.58]  But you're always a fan of making bold predictions and then being 100% right about them later.
[3115.78 --> 3118.50]  So feel free to keep your streak alive.
[3120.54 --> 3128.60]  I'm hopeful for this in regards to keeping companies alive in order to keep competition strong.
[3129.06 --> 3131.66]  I don't necessarily...
[3131.66 --> 3136.54]  You know, I'm not saying either company involved here is necessarily my favorite ever.
[3138.36 --> 3139.60]  Bold words.
[3139.60 --> 3139.70]  Bold words.
[3140.38 --> 3141.32]  Decisive words.
[3141.80 --> 3145.78]  But it's already an incredibly small space for CPUs and GPUs.
[3146.36 --> 3159.60]  And to have one leave who is doing both would leave us with effectively one CPU and realistically one GPU, which is not a good...
[3160.82 --> 3162.74]  Not a good pool of companies.
[3162.74 --> 3164.82]  So we need Intel to survive.
[3165.38 --> 3169.42]  And this gives me some solid hope that there's actual possibility there.
[3169.60 --> 3177.52]  Because it doesn't seem like they want to, you know, keep a CEO around long enough to actually follow through on their vision.
[3177.82 --> 3182.64]  So, like, if they need shorter term things, maybe this is it.
[3183.22 --> 3184.04]  I don't know.
[3185.48 --> 3185.70]  Oh.
[3185.70 --> 3187.86]  There you go.
[3187.98 --> 3188.26]  Perfect.
[3188.64 --> 3188.76]  Good.
[3188.82 --> 3189.02]  Nice.
[3189.10 --> 3189.78]  I can't do it from here.
[3189.86 --> 3190.38]  So, thank you.
[3191.02 --> 3191.42]  All right.
[3191.46 --> 3192.14]  What do you want to talk about?
[3192.22 --> 3192.62]  No, wait.
[3192.82 --> 3193.70]  CW announce.
[3193.92 --> 3195.12]  Explain in something...
[3195.12 --> 3195.36]  Okay.
[3195.42 --> 3197.58]  I'm supposed to follow the instructions from the Dan.
[3198.36 --> 3199.34]  Dan, what do I do?
[3199.98 --> 3201.16]  I don't see the announcement.
[3201.38 --> 3202.36]  I don't see anything there.
[3202.56 --> 3203.22]  Talking point.
[3204.48 --> 3205.16]  Talking point?
[3206.46 --> 3207.18]  That...
[3207.18 --> 3208.92]  He's not kidding.
[3209.04 --> 3210.28]  That's literally all it says.
[3211.34 --> 3211.74]  What?
[3213.02 --> 3214.04]  You're wearing a shirt.
[3214.28 --> 3215.28]  How am I supposed to...
[3215.28 --> 3216.66]  How am I supposed to do this?
[3216.66 --> 3217.22]  This is a...
[3217.22 --> 3218.74]  It's a shirt that you can buy now.
[3218.74 --> 3219.56]  I don't know...
[3219.56 --> 3220.82]  I don't know how to do this.
[3220.92 --> 3221.16]  Okay.
[3221.34 --> 3222.82]  It's talking, but you've already done it.
[3222.94 --> 3223.76]  I'm going to do this.
[3224.54 --> 3225.72]  Explain merch messages.
[3226.72 --> 3227.10]  Well, hold on.
[3227.14 --> 3227.40]  Hold on.
[3227.48 --> 3228.20]  There's a...
[3228.20 --> 3228.38]  Wait.
[3228.38 --> 3228.44]  Wait.
[3228.44 --> 3228.72]  Wait.
[3228.78 --> 3229.94]  Are we waiting for someone to fill it out?
[3229.98 --> 3231.28]  Because there's a sale on on the store.
[3231.34 --> 3231.98]  We can talk about that.
[3232.16 --> 3232.42]  Yeah.
[3232.42 --> 3233.68]  And there's a shirt.
[3235.54 --> 3235.86]  But...
[3235.86 --> 3237.22]  There's a huge sale going on.
[3237.28 --> 3237.66]  What the?
[3237.80 --> 3238.06]  Wait.
[3238.50 --> 3238.84]  Oh.
[3239.04 --> 3239.34]  Okay.
[3239.50 --> 3241.88]  There's the defragmentation sale.
[3242.50 --> 3243.92]  System cleanup finished.
[3245.06 --> 3250.56]  Savings of up to 65% on select items from September 19th to October 6th.
[3250.56 --> 3251.58]  What do we got here?
[3252.20 --> 3254.02]  We've got blank t-shirts for...
[3255.02 --> 3258.26]  We're doing blank shirts for $16.24.
[3258.26 --> 3262.52]  We're doing long sleeves for $16.24 Canadian.
[3263.18 --> 3266.28]  There's some really crazy deals in here, actually.
[3268.46 --> 3269.10]  Okay.
[3269.42 --> 3273.52]  I'm told both the people who are supposed to do the announcements are away.
[3274.26 --> 3274.54]  Oh.
[3275.36 --> 3275.92]  Okay.
[3277.16 --> 3277.76]  Adlib.
[3278.12 --> 3279.98]  Our Hydrophase swim shorts.
[3279.98 --> 3283.88]  So these are the ones that when they get wet, they reveal a pattern.
[3284.36 --> 3285.04]  Cool, right?
[3285.32 --> 3286.26]  By the way...
[3286.26 --> 3287.66]  Oh, I learned this the hard way.
[3287.66 --> 3291.84]  If you run them through the dryer, it kind of bricks that functionality.
[3292.54 --> 3294.34]  But apparently, you can restore it.
[3294.46 --> 3299.34]  Tatiana told me I can fix it by ironing it on very, very low heat.
[3299.74 --> 3300.98]  I haven't tried that yet.
[3301.24 --> 3305.50]  So anyway, if there's anyone who has Hydrophase shorts out there and they have that issue,
[3305.66 --> 3308.14]  that's what I've been told by the CW team.
[3309.38 --> 3309.86]  Anywho.
[3310.26 --> 3314.92]  So our Hydrophase shirts are $31.49 Canadian on the Global Store.
[3314.92 --> 3319.60]  The MAC address Oxford shirt is $7?
[3320.54 --> 3323.14]  How did we not save this for Black Friday?
[3324.30 --> 3325.60]  I do not...
[3325.60 --> 3325.80]  $7?
[3326.44 --> 3327.48]  Is that a typo?
[3327.60 --> 3329.40]  Oh, we have only one size.
[3329.88 --> 3332.32]  There's only one size XL in stock.
[3332.64 --> 3333.94]  It's a really nice shirt.
[3333.94 --> 3339.72]  And it fits like a shirt should fit and makes you look really cool.
[3340.54 --> 3342.28]  Anyway, okay.
[3342.58 --> 3343.54]  And you're wearing a new shirt.
[3343.54 --> 3345.04]  I have a feeling there's a digit missing there.
[3345.12 --> 3345.82]  We'll get to that.
[3345.84 --> 3348.02]  No, I think that's right.
[3348.10 --> 3349.60]  Because we only have the one size.
[3349.82 --> 3351.76]  So we're just trying to blow away the XLs.
[3352.12 --> 3352.94]  Still, like...
[3352.94 --> 3354.90]  Oh, dude!
[3355.06 --> 3355.72]  This is hilarious!
[3356.26 --> 3358.04]  This is the shirt that I was wearing today.
[3360.50 --> 3364.62]  They had me change because I'm supposed to wear the polo,
[3364.84 --> 3367.98]  which is, I think, a launch of a new color today or something like that.
[3368.12 --> 3374.34]  But I was totally wearing the not a hot dog, I'll kill you in ketchup v-neck.
[3374.48 --> 3374.72]  Oh, wait.
[3374.78 --> 3375.44]  This is a v-neck.
[3376.10 --> 3377.88]  Okay, so this is a v-neck of it.
[3378.00 --> 3379.38]  Okay, so I wasn't quite wearing this.
[3380.36 --> 3384.80]  Okay, so the v-neck is $12.49 Canadian.
[3385.50 --> 3388.52]  These circuit desk pads are $20 Canadian.
[3389.02 --> 3389.78]  Oh, sold out.
[3389.88 --> 3391.54]  Okay, apparently you guys have found stuff.
[3391.88 --> 3392.84]  Big Nerd Gaming!
[3393.08 --> 3393.82]  Oh, sold out.
[3393.90 --> 3394.24]  Okay.
[3394.70 --> 3395.48]  Okay, you guys...
[3395.48 --> 3398.34]  So it seems like it was things with only, like, one size left.
[3399.04 --> 3399.96]  Okay, yeah, you guys...
[3399.96 --> 3400.88]  And we're blowing out those sizes.
[3401.04 --> 3402.28]  You guys found...
[3402.28 --> 3404.68]  Hey, but you can still get the brick screensaver shirt.
[3404.76 --> 3406.40]  Dude, these are so popular around the office.
[3406.86 --> 3407.96]  People wear the crap out of these.
[3408.06 --> 3409.16]  Anyway, wow.
[3409.78 --> 3410.06]  Yep.
[3410.44 --> 3411.58]  So there's a bunch of stuff.
[3412.18 --> 3413.44]  You can still get a firewall department.
[3413.54 --> 3414.12]  Nope, not anymore.
[3414.28 --> 3414.66]  Sold out.
[3415.08 --> 3415.44]  Yep.
[3415.76 --> 3416.72]  That makes sense.
[3419.32 --> 3423.44]  Anyway, the one that I'm wearing is our green polo shirt.
[3424.48 --> 3426.16]  That can't be the green one.
[3426.42 --> 3427.48]  That's got to be the black one.
[3427.54 --> 3428.28]  Hey, yeah, there we go.
[3428.34 --> 3428.64]  There we go.
[3428.68 --> 3429.34]  That's the green one.
[3429.34 --> 3432.80]  You, too, can look like a professional like Colton here.
[3433.12 --> 3435.12]  Available in at least a couple of sizes.
[3436.04 --> 3437.48]  $14.99 Canadian.
[3437.62 --> 3439.60]  Small or large, if you happen to be a small or a large.
[3440.48 --> 3441.48]  Okay, there.
[3441.82 --> 3443.02]  I think I did...
[3443.02 --> 3443.98]  Did I do it right, Dan?
[3444.78 --> 3446.14]  Did I do a good job?
[3446.24 --> 3446.98]  Talking point.
[3447.16 --> 3447.96]  Was I a good...
[3447.96 --> 3449.02]  I think that's the best we can do.
[3449.08 --> 3450.02]  Was I a good shill?
[3450.72 --> 3451.08]  No.
[3451.44 --> 3452.72]  You were the best shill.
[3454.16 --> 3455.60]  Couldn't have said it better myself.
[3455.60 --> 3459.80]  Yeah.
[3461.38 --> 3461.82]  Right.
[3461.94 --> 3462.50]  Merch messages.
[3462.66 --> 3467.54]  So, if you want to interact with the show, the best way to do it is with a merch message.
[3467.98 --> 3477.26]  And this basically comes down to mine and Luke's philosophy that if you're going to throw money at your screen, you should get high quality merchandise in return.
[3477.26 --> 3482.76]  So, all you got to do is add something to your cart, maybe from our defragmentation sale.
[3483.86 --> 3484.82]  Go to your cart.
[3485.06 --> 3486.86]  And when we're live, you will see...
[3486.86 --> 3487.92]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[3487.98 --> 3491.58]  The merch message box where you can put your...
[3491.58 --> 3494.84]  You can say if you want your first name and last initial or if you want to be anonymous.
[3495.24 --> 3496.40]  You can type a little message.
[3496.54 --> 3497.44]  You can choose a color.
[3497.54 --> 3498.72]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[3498.90 --> 3499.44]  Ba-ba-ba-ba.
[3499.54 --> 3502.38]  You can opt into email communication about your message.
[3502.50 --> 3504.68]  You can get clarification on what the crap that means.
[3504.68 --> 3507.12]  And then you can go ahead and place your order.
[3507.24 --> 3513.10]  It will go to producer Dan who will type a response or throw your message...
[3513.10 --> 3518.38]  Put it at the bottom of the screen like Jacob Ells.
[3518.78 --> 3520.06]  Or he can...
[3520.06 --> 3520.88]  What else can he do?
[3521.00 --> 3521.30]  Oh, yeah.
[3521.34 --> 3524.94]  He can forward it and get you a response after the fact if you opt into the email thing.
[3526.22 --> 3527.64]  Or he can just throw it away.
[3528.36 --> 3529.66]  He actually has that power.
[3529.76 --> 3531.58]  He can just nuke it.
[3532.00 --> 3534.40]  Send good merch messages or trash.
[3534.94 --> 3535.28]  Wow.
[3536.02 --> 3536.42]  Aggressive.
[3537.58 --> 3538.32]  Do better.
[3539.12 --> 3539.78]  Thank you, Dan.
[3540.16 --> 3544.74]  If he curates it, then it will be for discussion later on the show for me and Luke.
[3544.80 --> 3546.98]  And we'll do a couple of those to show you what that looks like.
[3547.40 --> 3547.80]  Sure.
[3547.98 --> 3548.16]  Yeah.
[3548.20 --> 3549.14]  I've got a bunch coming in.
[3549.50 --> 3552.06]  Seems like the Europeans are happy we're doing an early show.
[3552.40 --> 3552.66]  Nice.
[3552.84 --> 3556.44]  With the Final Fantasy Tactics remake launching soon, will you be playing it?
[3556.50 --> 3558.78]  And will you quote unquote challenge Luke to play?
[3558.94 --> 3560.78]  You should give Triangle Strategy a try.
[3561.02 --> 3561.86]  Great game.
[3561.86 --> 3563.20]  I have been...
[3563.20 --> 3566.04]  Triangle Strategy is on my list, but I haven't played it yet.
[3566.26 --> 3574.56]  And I will almost certainly replay Final Fantasy Tactics before I play Triangle Strategy just because, oh my god, it's Final Fantasy Tactics.
[3574.74 --> 3579.18]  And it's possibly the best game ever.
[3579.18 --> 3581.14]  No, no, no, it's probably not the best game ever.
[3581.22 --> 3582.52]  But it's so good.
[3582.58 --> 3583.18]  It's incredible.
[3583.70 --> 3589.46]  I think I should challenge Luke to play it, but I'm going to have to come up with something that I have to do.
[3589.80 --> 3595.68]  Like, Luke, is there something that sort of you've been badgering me to do that you can think of right now?
[3595.78 --> 3597.66]  Because I'm down for round two.
[3598.08 --> 3599.42]  I'm down for round two.
[3600.48 --> 3601.58]  I'll think on it.
[3601.80 --> 3604.40]  I'd love to push you through Unmodded Morrowind.
[3604.40 --> 3604.68]  Unmodded Morrowind.
[3606.68 --> 3608.70]  Why the f*** would I want to play that?
[3609.36 --> 3612.16]  Spend 45 minutes making your character get killed by a crab.
[3612.74 --> 3614.56]  I did try to play Morrowind once.
[3615.30 --> 3619.56]  So Oblivion was my first Elder Scrolls, and I enjoyed the crap out of it.
[3619.56 --> 3623.44]  I put probably a couple hundred hours into Oblivion, which for me is a lot.
[3623.58 --> 3627.28]  That's a lot of attention span for me.
[3628.56 --> 3634.98]  And I just enjoyed exploring and enjoyed fighting, enjoyed every aspect of that game.
[3635.50 --> 3637.94]  And I was like, oh man, I want more Elder Scrolls.
[3637.94 --> 3640.02]  And we were years away from Skyrim still at that point.
[3640.30 --> 3642.28]  So I was like, how about I play Morrowind?
[3642.32 --> 3643.96]  I bought it and I played it.
[3644.24 --> 3646.22]  And I walked down a path.
[3646.28 --> 3647.48]  This is all I remember of it.
[3647.48 --> 3650.48]  There's like the starting village or town or whatever.
[3650.72 --> 3652.62]  And then I left it and I walked down a path.
[3652.70 --> 3655.32]  And I got absolutely f***ing obliterated by something.
[3655.40 --> 3659.18]  And I was like, I don't even understand what to do.
[3660.02 --> 3662.16]  Like this is back when games had manuals.
[3662.80 --> 3663.88]  That's a lore accurate.
[3664.68 --> 3667.32]  Yeah, it's a lore accurate Morrowind experience.
[3669.28 --> 3670.52]  Yeah, I'll think of some.
[3672.92 --> 3674.08]  Unmodded Morrowind.
[3675.02 --> 3677.36]  Beating FTL would be kind of fun.
[3678.44 --> 3679.72]  Never played Fast and Light.
[3680.38 --> 3682.26]  Or like unlocking three ships or something.
[3682.32 --> 3683.82]  Because you could beat it pretty fast, I think.
[3688.02 --> 3689.24]  Beating Slay the Spire.
[3689.44 --> 3692.98]  I feel like I could probably do it with a game that's like a roguelike.
[3693.08 --> 3696.22]  But then the task would just be actually like beating the game.
[3697.30 --> 3698.18]  I'll find something.
[3698.32 --> 3700.00]  I'm not going to figure it out now, but I'll find something.
[3700.58 --> 3700.90]  Okay.
[3701.16 --> 3701.54]  All right.
[3701.54 --> 3705.74]  Hopefully whatever you pick is more fun than what you picked last time.
[3706.72 --> 3708.20]  Part of last time was Titanfall.
[3708.32 --> 3708.98]  Titanfall was great.
[3709.32 --> 3711.68]  Titanfall 2 campaign was outstanding.
[3712.70 --> 3714.72]  Pirates of Silicon Valley was a tough watch.
[3714.82 --> 3717.16]  And Hackers was a really tough watch.
[3717.16 --> 3723.54]  I still adore both of them.
[3723.54 --> 3729.24]  I think between the two of them, it took me about nine seatings to get through them.
[3731.94 --> 3733.02]  Like, I'm sorry.
[3733.16 --> 3735.36]  There are definitely some, yes, Hack the Planet.
[3735.52 --> 3741.24]  There are definitely some great lines in both and some great moments in both.
[3741.24 --> 3746.90]  But as films, I am not convinced that they are very outstanding.
[3747.32 --> 3747.88]  I'm sorry.
[3748.06 --> 3751.68]  This is going to be, I know this is going to be a super controversial take for some of you.
[3752.44 --> 3754.28]  Pirates of Silicon Valley gets me jazzed up.
[3754.28 --> 3763.24]  I think part of it's like, when I saw that was like, my god tier computers teacher was like,
[3764.24 --> 3770.62]  showed it to a class of us that like actually really cared about this stuff to like inspire us.
[3770.62 --> 3772.20]  And it kind of hit at the right time.
[3772.74 --> 3777.56]  So there's, I mean, there's definitely like really intense nostalgia glasses with both of them.
[3779.66 --> 3780.68]  It is what it is.
[3783.64 --> 3784.50]  Dan, hit me.
[3784.72 --> 3784.94]  Sure.
[3785.98 --> 3792.32]  Hey, DLL, how do you react when people tell you you have in some part influenced a significant part of their lives or careers?
[3792.78 --> 3796.24]  Someone working in tech after becoming interested in watching YouTube.
[3796.24 --> 3796.36]  Dude.
[3798.22 --> 3808.16]  I mean, I think in the early days, I just kind of found it hard to believe because I just felt like I was a kid playing around with computers on camera.
[3809.04 --> 3812.38]  I was, you know, just doing, I was just doing my job to an extent.
[3812.62 --> 3818.64]  I, you know, I, I, I think I just didn't really, I didn't really know how to process that.
[3818.64 --> 3820.28]  I didn't really know how to deal with that.
[3820.72 --> 3823.32]  Um, cause it seemed like almost like too much pressure.
[3823.52 --> 3830.30]  Like I, Oh, I, I don't want to be responsible for people's, you know, career choices or, or whatever.
[3830.30 --> 3856.68]  Um, but these days I, I've, I've really embraced that and I've, I've come to see that as kind of our role in the tech space because we are not going to give the deepest dive into, you know, fricking packet sniffing, encrypted USB connections and, and reverse engineering, you know, embedded display port to make a custom laptop.
[3856.68 --> 3859.16]  You know, that's, that's not really going to be our thing.
[3859.26 --> 3864.20]  There's going to be other channels that are going to go much deeper into any given vertical than we ever will.
[3864.72 --> 3868.66]  But I see our role as fire starters.
[3869.26 --> 3881.90]  Um, you know, our job is to, to put people on a path where they, so, so we, we just like, we, we kind of throw some, some Tinder and we throw some, some sparks at it.
[3881.90 --> 3889.66]  And we put people on this path where they can then bloom into a, an inferno of incredible tech passion and knowledge.
[3890.14 --> 3894.26]  And, um, it's something that I think that I think we do really well.
[3894.38 --> 3898.12]  I actually had a really cool interaction along these lines just yesterday.
[3898.12 --> 3918.82]  Uh, we had a really nice gentleman by the name of Tom who came here all the way from Brazil, uh, which was apparently an arduous journey and involved almost getting deported when he landed in Canada because they simply didn't believe that he came all the way here for two days to claim a prize.
[3918.82 --> 3928.24]  Even some of his own family members, um, were like, I think you're being trafficked.
[3928.92 --> 3932.22]  Um, so he's a winner for ROG rig reboot.
[3932.36 --> 3944.42]  Anyway, uh, I, I drove him back to the hotel after, after we shot yesterday and he basically was like, yeah, I, I was a gamer, but it was actually your content.
[3944.42 --> 3954.66]  That made me passionate about tech and solving tech problems and kind of set me on the path that I'm, that I'm on right now and, and, and helped ignite this passion.
[3954.66 --> 3960.18]  And I kind of went mission accomplished because that's what we're trying to do.
[3960.24 --> 3966.28]  And there's things that Tom is way better at than me, which is exactly what I want.
[3966.28 --> 3972.98]  That should be the goal of every teacher where your job is to get people excited.
[3973.10 --> 3977.18]  Like that's my primary job is to get people excited about technology.
[3977.48 --> 3982.28]  And then I get to sit back and see where they take it from there.
[3982.44 --> 3984.64]  And that was, that was a super cool experience.
[3989.06 --> 3990.96]  Oh, Dan, Dan put a new thing there.
[3990.98 --> 3992.44]  It says two more topics.
[3992.74 --> 3994.36]  All right, Luke, you want to pick one?
[3994.36 --> 3996.10]  I feel like I've done most of the talking today.
[3996.16 --> 3996.44]  Sorry.
[3997.88 --> 4000.10]  Yeah, I'm going to go a little bit off the rails right now.
[4000.10 --> 4000.18]  Not actually sorry.
[4001.12 --> 4007.02]  Can I, can I, can I get you to bring up a YouTube real quick and look for a channel?
[4007.64 --> 4009.38]  Uh, I mean, yeah, sure.
[4009.44 --> 4010.62]  I guess I'm just your now.
[4010.72 --> 4011.00]  Apparently.
[4011.64 --> 4012.00]  Yeah.
[4012.06 --> 4016.66]  I let you talk one time and you're like, yeah, could you just start issuing orders?
[4016.82 --> 4017.22]  Sorry.
[4019.14 --> 4022.28]  Look up just James channel, James space channel.
[4022.64 --> 4023.46]  James channel.
[4023.56 --> 4024.12]  I'm sure.
[4024.80 --> 4025.44]  James channel.
[4025.60 --> 4026.30]  Games for James.
[4026.30 --> 4038.52]  So this is a, this is a, uh, full plane crater actually, um, works with, uh, Mr. Mr. Dank pods on the garbage time channel doing automotive stuff.
[4038.78 --> 4039.10]  What?
[4039.10 --> 4043.36]  Um, and also makes really cool things.
[4043.36 --> 4048.46]  So I saw this Xbox one come through recently and he's done stuff like this a few times.
[4048.52 --> 4053.44]  Like if you scroll back through his channel, this is not the first time he's done something like this.
[4053.52 --> 4055.18]  Look at, look at the disc.
[4055.18 --> 4058.06]  Look at the disc drive.
[4058.06 --> 4058.12]  Yeah.
[4058.12 --> 4058.14]  Look at the disc drive.
[4058.92 --> 4060.04]  Oh, this is sick.
[4061.62 --> 4063.68]  Um, but you know, we've taken.
[4063.80 --> 4064.86]  He's glued down the wire.
[4065.70 --> 4065.94]  Wow.
[4065.98 --> 4066.56]  The bodge wire.
[4066.64 --> 4067.02]  Oh yeah, dude.
[4067.02 --> 4068.04]  Oh yeah.
[4068.08 --> 4068.64]  It's glued.
[4069.78 --> 4070.54]  Professional glue.
[4070.76 --> 4072.06]  Like, okay.
[4072.18 --> 4072.42]  Sorry.
[4072.50 --> 4072.70]  Yes.
[4072.78 --> 4073.20]  Carry on.
[4074.20 --> 4079.36]  Uh, and we, we've done this a few times where we've like, uh, featured you, you were talking
[4079.36 --> 4084.50]  about how, oh, we might not be the person to reverse engineer, uh, the internal display
[4084.50 --> 4085.86]  port, whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4086.24 --> 4091.72]  Um, yeah, like we might not be, we might not be the person doing this either.
[4092.10 --> 4098.26]  Um, and I think it's been a fun trend that we've had over the last little bit, um, of showing
[4098.26 --> 4101.82]  off some really cool stuff that creators on YouTube have done on WAN show.
[4101.94 --> 4107.46]  And I wanted to feature James channel for a second because this video was wild.
[4107.60 --> 4108.88]  It was, it was very fun.
[4108.88 --> 4110.52]  And the end result is insane.
[4111.08 --> 4114.28]  Um, it's just, it's a trip.
[4114.50 --> 4118.72]  And, uh, I think, I think our audience would enjoy it.
[4118.80 --> 4120.24]  So yeah, go check it out.
[4120.56 --> 4120.74]  Cool.
[4120.86 --> 4123.62]  And while you're having a mechanical lemon powered Game Boy.
[4128.14 --> 4130.10]  There's a party I would attend.
[4131.18 --> 4133.52]  I mean, right out the gate, he was hitting it hard.
[4133.76 --> 4138.86]  If you look at, if you look at the first video on his channel, um, like there was,
[4138.88 --> 4141.16]  there was no chill at any point in time.
[4142.04 --> 4147.18]  Um, it's the, the first video on his channel is a 1 million view video from two years ago
[4147.18 --> 4148.92]  of making a portable Super Nintendo.
[4149.68 --> 4150.12]  Brilliant.
[4150.88 --> 4152.84]  With like duct tape.
[4152.84 --> 4156.02]  All right.
[4156.02 --> 4156.86]  It's awesome.
[4157.16 --> 4161.80]  So yeah, feel free to go check out James channel if you want a deeper dive into depravity.
[4162.60 --> 4163.26]  Uh, okay.
[4163.36 --> 4165.34]  Why don't we pick another topic then?
[4165.46 --> 4166.32]  Wait, was that a topic?
[4167.46 --> 4167.74]  No.
[4167.94 --> 4168.36]  Oh, okay.
[4168.44 --> 4168.62]  Cool.
[4168.62 --> 4170.70]  Luke, do you want to pick a real topic this time?
[4172.32 --> 4172.68]  Sure.
[4172.92 --> 4179.54]  Uh, speaking of, of, uh, handhelds, um, and making things portable, I guess, uh, Windows handheld
[4179.54 --> 4180.60]  gaming mode leaked.
[4181.32 --> 4184.10]  Uh, I think this is, I think you have to do something for this.
[4184.10 --> 4189.34]  Microsoft's much anticipated handheld gaming mode is now available to preview if you're
[4189.34 --> 4195.70]  running Windows 11 25 H2, which is currently in release preview on Windows Insider.
[4196.02 --> 4201.14]  Redditor gogc123 posted an extensive guide on getting things up and running.
[4201.48 --> 4202.96]  Tried at your own risk, of course.
[4203.30 --> 4205.80]  Uh, we've got it set up on this Ally X.
[4206.24 --> 4207.56]  So let's try it out.
[4207.56 --> 4213.26]  And then there's some notes here that says, uh, you're in 1080p, couldn't get display mirroring
[4213.26 --> 4214.32]  working otherwise.
[4214.82 --> 4217.62]  Drag finger up from the bottom to alt tab.
[4217.84 --> 4219.04]  Oh, that makes sense.
[4219.10 --> 4220.34]  That's interesting, but that makes sense.
[4220.70 --> 4226.52]  Um, I had to manually putz around to get the option for the new UI to show up at all.
[4226.88 --> 4227.90]  Steam games work great.
[4228.18 --> 4232.44]  Game pass stuff was a little iffy, but seems okay after bypassing our cache servers.
[4232.82 --> 4233.26]  Okay.
[4233.44 --> 4236.98]  So this is the part where I switch over to Luke.
[4236.98 --> 4237.86]  Yeah, there we go.
[4237.86 --> 4238.76]  Laptop re-air.
[4239.44 --> 4242.22]  Um, and this is it.
[4242.72 --> 4250.56]  So I had, I did have a hands-on with the ROGX, Ally X, Xbox X, whatever the new one is
[4250.56 --> 4250.86]  called.
[4251.34 --> 4257.62]  Um, having a very hard time remembering because it's just a bunch of random brand words, uh,
[4257.62 --> 4259.64]  combined in ways that don't make any sense to me.
[4260.14 --> 4261.74]  Um, it's an Xbox name.
[4261.78 --> 4262.36]  What can I say?
[4262.36 --> 4262.80]  Okay.
[4263.02 --> 4272.06]  But I didn't have much time with the actual UI of, um, that like the new handheld gaming
[4272.06 --> 4274.36]  mode windows UI at all.
[4274.56 --> 4276.90]  So this is it.
[4276.90 --> 4278.34]  So what am I looking at here?
[4278.38 --> 4278.64]  Okay.
[4278.96 --> 4281.66]  So here's, here's game pass, which makes sense.
[4281.68 --> 4282.80]  It's pretty responsive.
[4283.74 --> 4284.38]  Not bad.
[4284.82 --> 4285.14]  Actually.
[4285.22 --> 4285.70]  Oh, you know what?
[4285.72 --> 4286.94]  It's, it's better in person.
[4286.94 --> 4291.86]  Cause this is a 120 Hertz display and you guys are seeing this probably through 30 FPS capture.
[4291.86 --> 4297.46]  So, so don't, don't read too much into the kind of like leggy lookingness of it.
[4297.50 --> 4299.92]  It actually looks really smooth in my hands.
[4300.52 --> 4302.18]  Uh, what else do we have over here?
[4302.30 --> 4304.26]  So here's my library, I assume.
[4304.96 --> 4305.38]  Cool.
[4305.80 --> 4307.00]  Here's a bunch of steam games.
[4307.16 --> 4314.12]  So Microsoft didn't explicitly say during the event that they would support steam because,
[4314.30 --> 4318.50]  you know, it'd be weird for them to name a direct competitor to game, to game pass or
[4318.50 --> 4322.86]  whatever, uh, but they did say that third party stores would be supported and winked
[4322.86 --> 4325.28]  really, really hard or they add something in their eye or something.
[4325.92 --> 4329.16]  Um, so here's a bunch of steam games.
[4329.28 --> 4330.36]  I'm not going to launch a game yet.
[4330.36 --> 4335.12]  Cause I kind of want to poke around in the UI first, but we've got installed owned.
[4336.58 --> 4336.98]  Okay.
[4338.38 --> 4340.32]  Oh, okay.
[4340.32 --> 4341.82]  So here's owned.
[4342.70 --> 4345.94]  So all of the games that we have installed are not owned.
[4345.94 --> 4347.48]  All right.
[4347.54 --> 4350.72]  I might have to figure that out before we actually play a game.
[4350.72 --> 4353.80]  If we're going to play a game, uh, installable.
[4353.96 --> 4356.16]  What's the difference between owned and installable?
[4356.82 --> 4358.58]  I'm sure I'll figure it out at some point.
[4360.88 --> 4362.74]  Uh, all right, cool.
[4363.64 --> 4364.56]  Cloud playable.
[4365.16 --> 4374.74]  One thing that I don't see in here is the, uh, validated for, uh, windows mobile devices
[4374.74 --> 4375.28]  or whatever.
[4375.54 --> 4376.34]  Oh, here's input.
[4376.96 --> 4377.36]  Okay.
[4377.44 --> 4381.28]  So yeah, obviously PC game pad and okay.
[4381.28 --> 4382.24]  What's capabilities.
[4384.24 --> 4384.52]  Okay.
[4384.62 --> 4384.98]  Hold on.
[4385.46 --> 4386.48]  This is probably user error.
[4386.82 --> 4387.22]  Okay.
[4387.38 --> 4388.34]  Uh, oh, okay.
[4388.50 --> 4390.70]  Cloud enabled Xbox achievements.
[4391.70 --> 4392.36]  All right.
[4392.78 --> 4393.22]  Players.
[4393.78 --> 4394.30]  Oh, okay.
[4394.30 --> 4394.88]  This is cool.
[4395.04 --> 4397.16]  I'd like to be able to add more of my own.
[4397.16 --> 4401.94]  Um, like one of the things that is really great about steam is being able to have your
[4401.94 --> 4406.24]  custom filters, um, which are often community generated and maintained.
[4406.46 --> 4411.98]  So I like to use things like, uh, four player, local multiplayer and stuff like that to help
[4411.98 --> 4416.66]  find games, you know, during, uh, during an event or whatever playable without tough
[4416.66 --> 4417.84]  touch controls.
[4417.94 --> 4418.38]  Oh, okay.
[4419.04 --> 4421.06]  So here's a bunch of usability stuff.
[4421.26 --> 4422.36]  Single stick gameplay.
[4422.36 --> 4423.48]  This is really cool.
[4423.58 --> 4429.48]  Microsoft has a great mind for accessibility with Xbox.
[4429.98 --> 4433.82]  And, uh, this actually feels like an extendability of that.
[4433.96 --> 4435.42]  Oh, well, I misread it.
[4435.46 --> 4436.86]  It is called accessibility features.
[4436.92 --> 4437.06]  Okay.
[4437.10 --> 4437.56]  Good, good, good.
[4437.82 --> 4438.64]  Uh, that makes sense.
[4439.04 --> 4439.32]  Okay.
[4439.34 --> 4439.94]  What else we got?
[4440.06 --> 4441.80]  Oh, which drive it's installed on?
[4441.92 --> 4442.08]  Okay.
[4442.08 --> 4445.18]  I don't know that I would care that much about that, but Hey, whatever genres.
[4445.48 --> 4446.10]  Okay, cool.
[4446.16 --> 4448.16]  So you've got some filters there in the library.
[4448.22 --> 4448.42]  Okay.
[4448.44 --> 4449.36]  Cloud, cloud gaming.
[4449.36 --> 4453.12]  I could play a cloud game from the cloud.
[4454.18 --> 4460.40]  Like for instance, uh, but the asphalt legends play with cloud.
[4460.58 --> 4461.48]  Can I do this?
[4462.80 --> 4463.96]  Will we have a big sword?
[4468.44 --> 4469.32]  Wait for it.
[4469.44 --> 4470.90]  I'm interested in what happens here.
[4472.06 --> 4477.62]  I mean, I have no idea what accounts we have or haven't even set up on this, but like, am
[4477.62 --> 4479.14]  I, am I cloud gaming right now?
[4479.36 --> 4482.30]  That's pretty cool.
[4482.90 --> 4484.04]  Sure seems like it.
[4484.76 --> 4486.66]  Except I accept the permissions.
[4487.22 --> 4488.58]  I accept the risk.
[4490.08 --> 4492.44]  Very nice that our firewall is allowing this to happen.
[4494.02 --> 4494.90]  Is it?
[4495.32 --> 4496.00]  Oh yeah.
[4496.12 --> 4497.44]  Well, yeah, it is.
[4497.44 --> 4502.22]  20 years of asphalt.
[4507.30 --> 4508.26]  Oh, okay.
[4508.42 --> 4509.26]  Can't skip it.
[4509.44 --> 4509.86]  Nice.
[4510.90 --> 4511.34]  Nice.
[4511.82 --> 4513.68]  Let's just watch this more.
[4514.38 --> 4515.78]  Ooh, a Lamborghini.
[4516.72 --> 4517.52]  Oh my God.
[4517.64 --> 4517.88]  Okay.
[4517.90 --> 4518.44]  Well, whatever.
[4518.50 --> 4520.26]  The point is, it seems to be working.
[4520.74 --> 4521.66]  It seems to be working.
[4521.66 --> 4521.90]  Okay.
[4522.00 --> 4523.32]  Do I have an overlay though?
[4523.76 --> 4524.02]  Okay.
[4524.06 --> 4529.56]  So here's the Asus overlay, but do I have a Microsoft overlay?
[4529.70 --> 4529.90]  Okay.
[4529.96 --> 4530.94]  No, that's Armory Crate.
[4530.94 --> 4538.80]  So there is a dedicated Xbox button on the new Ally Xbox X.
[4539.80 --> 4541.38]  I don't have one on this one.
[4541.60 --> 4543.14]  So now I'm in Armory Crate.
[4543.50 --> 4544.62]  Completely ignore that.
[4545.06 --> 4545.20]  Okay.
[4545.24 --> 4547.20]  So here's my alt tab menu by dragging up.
[4547.20 --> 4549.74]  And then, oh, ooh, that's interesting.
[4550.52 --> 4551.84]  Can I even use the touchscreen?
[4552.00 --> 4552.58]  Yes, I can.
[4552.80 --> 4554.18]  I can tap with the touchscreen.
[4554.94 --> 4555.96]  Hold right, trigger, trigger, accelerate.
[4556.08 --> 4556.68]  Yeah, I can do that.
[4556.80 --> 4557.00]  Cool.
[4557.22 --> 4562.68]  So I can tap with the touchscreen, but I can't, looks like, drag with the touchscreen, if you
[4562.68 --> 4563.22]  get what I mean.
[4563.52 --> 4566.24]  Like, I can't go, oh wait, yes, I can.
[4566.32 --> 4566.72]  Yes, I can.
[4566.78 --> 4567.24]  Okay, cool.
[4567.38 --> 4567.92]  Cool, cool, cool.
[4568.04 --> 4569.52]  Well, that was the alt tab thing, right?
[4569.54 --> 4570.50]  You swiped up from the bottom?
[4570.68 --> 4570.86]  Yeah.
[4571.16 --> 4571.38]  Yep.
[4571.38 --> 4572.62]  I thought I couldn't use the touchscreen.
[4572.62 --> 4574.94]  I thought I had to go back to the joystick, but I don't.
[4574.94 --> 4577.24]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4577.24 --> 4577.90]  Let's stick an X.
[4577.98 --> 4578.64]  Okay, got it, got it.
[4578.70 --> 4578.86]  Oh.
[4582.02 --> 4583.54]  Drift, drift all the things.
[4583.92 --> 4585.36]  I'm just going to hold X the whole time.
[4585.46 --> 4586.02]  Oh, okay.
[4586.16 --> 4587.18]  Well, that's the break.
[4587.48 --> 4588.74]  So, cool.
[4589.86 --> 4591.92]  Look, I've never played this game, okay?
[4592.30 --> 4594.22]  I think I'm cloud gaming right now.
[4594.28 --> 4595.08]  Okay, now what do I do?
[4595.38 --> 4596.16]  Now I quit the race.
[4596.24 --> 4597.34]  I want to close this game.
[4597.38 --> 4598.24]  I want to go back to the UI.
[4598.24 --> 4605.80]  Now, if you didn't catch our video on the new Xbox X Ally X X Dream.
[4607.10 --> 4607.92]  Oh, interesting.
[4608.14 --> 4609.16]  Here's a little thing.
[4609.24 --> 4610.28]  See this thing in the top left corner?
[4610.64 --> 4610.84]  Sorry.
[4610.94 --> 4616.94]  If you didn't catch our video, one of the benefits of this is that it doesn't actually, like,
[4617.14 --> 4619.14]  render the desktop behind it.
[4619.14 --> 4624.82]  So, theoretically, it's saving a lot of resources, and they claimed big savings in terms of RAM
[4624.82 --> 4629.22]  that will hopefully result in better performance in games, but I don't know if that's been
[4629.22 --> 4631.34]  proven yet one way or the other.
[4631.72 --> 4632.38]  Okay, so anyway, sorry.
[4632.46 --> 4632.80]  Back to this.
[4632.80 --> 4637.10]  Is that why when you're alt-tabbing, the background's just, like, that, like, whitish gray?
[4637.24 --> 4637.74]  Yes, sir.
[4638.72 --> 4640.64]  Okay, so I clicked that thing in the top left.
[4641.76 --> 4644.10]  Here's a little performance monitor thing.
[4644.92 --> 4645.98]  Can I, like, pin this?
[4645.98 --> 4647.24]  That makes sense, because you're cloud gaming.
[4647.24 --> 4649.46]  Oh, yeah, right, right, right, right, right.
[4649.52 --> 4653.20]  Yeah, okay, so yes, the cloud gaming just worked effortlessly like that.
[4653.86 --> 4654.92]  Xbox Social.
[4657.86 --> 4659.22]  Audio devices.
[4659.50 --> 4662.20]  Okay, that's actually pretty handy to have here.
[4663.34 --> 4666.30]  Personally, okay, yeah, no, yeah, you just tap to click.
[4666.78 --> 4670.50]  Game Assist, which, yeah, sure, I can talk about that another time.
[4671.76 --> 4672.16]  What is that?
[4672.28 --> 4673.08]  Screen Cap.
[4673.28 --> 4673.80]  What is this?
[4673.80 --> 4675.34]  Okay, so this is quick settings.
[4675.34 --> 4677.96]  Oh, more settings.
[4678.38 --> 4679.00]  Here we go.
[4680.26 --> 4680.66]  Cool.
[4681.84 --> 4684.96]  Sorry, guys, I'm just exploring this for the first time.
[4685.00 --> 4685.30]  One sec.
[4685.44 --> 4686.42]  Go to the more settings?
[4687.08 --> 4687.32]  Yeah.
[4687.56 --> 4690.02]  What's the gaming features?
[4691.80 --> 4694.28]  Your system is DirectX 12 Ultimate Ready.
[4694.28 --> 4700.94]  It is direct storage optimized, and this version of Windows supports the latest direct storage IO optimizations.
[4701.62 --> 4704.40]  Seems more like information than settings, but sure.
[4704.62 --> 4706.46]  Yeah, then, well, it is features.
[4706.58 --> 4707.32]  Those are features.
[4708.80 --> 4709.68]  Okay, here's home.
[4709.68 --> 4712.32]  Usually you can set settings.
[4712.66 --> 4714.02]  Okay, so let's go home.
[4714.14 --> 4716.04]  Can I just, like, close the game?
[4716.12 --> 4716.60]  Look at that.
[4716.94 --> 4717.86]  Jump back in.
[4718.54 --> 4720.42]  So is that game closed?
[4721.28 --> 4724.80]  Wow, that was a very Xbox console-like experience.
[4724.80 --> 4729.00]  So if I had an Xbox button, it would be that quick to go back home.
[4729.96 --> 4731.08]  That's pretty cool.
[4731.70 --> 4732.76]  I like that.
[4733.50 --> 4735.48]  Here's the store, because obviously there's a store.
[4737.32 --> 4738.26]  Everything has a store.
[4738.38 --> 4738.78]  Okay, hold on.
[4738.80 --> 4740.34]  I'm going to go back to home for a second here.
[4740.52 --> 4742.60]  Hopefully you guys are finding this as interesting as I am.
[4744.06 --> 4745.10]  What is the store?
[4745.24 --> 4748.14]  Is it just Microsoft, like Windows Store, whatever that's even called?
[4748.14 --> 4749.46]  Yeah, I don't.
[4749.62 --> 4756.16]  I mean, I think that would be a pretty far leap for them to not only integrate games from other storefronts,
[4756.20 --> 4758.14]  but also integrate other storefronts.
[4759.80 --> 4761.08]  Don't think that's going to be happening anytime soon.
[4761.08 --> 4763.32]  Yeah, it's just unfortunate that theirs is, like, the worst one.
[4763.66 --> 4768.38]  I might even argue that it's worse than Uplay, or whatever it's even called these days.
[4769.14 --> 4770.08]  Uh, what is this?
[4770.08 --> 4771.12]  It would be Soft Launcher or whatever.
[4771.44 --> 4772.94]  Oh, here's the download interface.
[4774.44 --> 4775.84]  Okay, so if I...
[4775.84 --> 4777.10]  I want to go back to that.
[4778.14 --> 4780.70]  You view profile settings.
[4781.04 --> 4781.32]  Okay.
[4782.22 --> 4783.80]  Uh, let's just close that.
[4784.38 --> 4785.08]  Uh, okay.
[4785.16 --> 4786.16]  I want to go back to this.
[4786.46 --> 4787.84]  And I'm going to go to...
[4787.84 --> 4788.96]  No, man, where would...
[4788.96 --> 4789.78]  Where'd that Xbox?
[4791.12 --> 4792.70]  What happens if I slide in from the sides?
[4792.78 --> 4793.54]  Okay, notifications.
[4793.84 --> 4795.04]  What if I slide in from this side?
[4795.14 --> 4795.74]  Oh, okay.
[4796.18 --> 4798.20]  Slide in from the side gives me that interface.
[4798.80 --> 4799.06]  Cool.
[4799.18 --> 4799.64]  That's cool.
[4799.82 --> 4800.30]  I like that.
[4800.30 --> 4804.56]  So let's use this to jump right into a game that I don't have open.
[4805.00 --> 4807.82]  So presumably, it is managing all this in the background.
[4807.82 --> 4808.94]  It's closing Asphalt.
[4809.26 --> 4810.66]  It's firing up Steam.
[4811.40 --> 4813.06]  Because remember, Asphalt wasn't a Steam game.
[4813.54 --> 4818.06]  And then we're firing up Tape to Tape, which I'm going to use this moment to promote.
[4818.50 --> 4825.00]  Tape to Tape is a great little roguelite hockey game that is being developed by Excellent Rectangle.
[4825.00 --> 4826.52]  Really small team.
[4826.60 --> 4827.40]  Canadian team.
[4827.76 --> 4829.02]  It's their first game.
[4829.26 --> 4832.64]  And you'd never know it playing it because it's super cool, super fun.
[4834.66 --> 4835.44]  No investment.
[4835.82 --> 4837.24]  No investment whatsoever.
[4837.56 --> 4839.56]  I just think it's a super cool game and I love it.
[4840.44 --> 4841.60]  We've invested time.
[4841.60 --> 4841.90]  Lots of time.
[4842.16 --> 4843.66]  Yeah, definitely lots of time.
[4844.52 --> 4845.04]  Hold on.
[4845.12 --> 4845.78]  I don't want to continue.
[4846.44 --> 4846.60]  Oh.
[4847.02 --> 4847.42]  Uh-oh.
[4847.56 --> 4849.06]  How's my screen cap going here?
[4849.42 --> 4849.74]  Uh-oh.
[4850.48 --> 4850.94]  Uh-oh.
[4851.74 --> 4852.30]  Hold on.
[4852.34 --> 4854.08]  I'm going to give it the old unplug and replug here.
[4854.70 --> 4855.02]  One sec.
[4855.04 --> 4855.80]  Yeah, we're in a box.
[4856.48 --> 4856.76]  Yep.
[4856.98 --> 4857.80]  I'm working on it.
[4857.88 --> 4858.26]  I'm cooking.
[4859.10 --> 4859.46]  Hey.
[4859.72 --> 4860.10]  Oh.
[4860.42 --> 4860.78]  Hey.
[4862.44 --> 4863.32]  You know what?
[4863.34 --> 4864.82]  I wonder if it's a resolution issue.
[4864.90 --> 4865.06]  Yep.
[4865.16 --> 4865.34]  Yep.
[4865.40 --> 4865.56]  Yep.
[4865.56 --> 4867.30]  This is what Jordan was talking about.
[4868.08 --> 4868.32]  Yep.
[4869.06 --> 4869.42]  Cool.
[4869.42 --> 4873.76]  Let's go with that one.
[4874.56 --> 4875.52]  What are my odds here?
[4876.36 --> 4876.72]  Hey.
[4877.48 --> 4878.48]  Let's go.
[4878.86 --> 4879.56]  It's going to work pretty quick.
[4879.84 --> 4887.54]  There was a good question from Roy Yamaha, which was, at some point in time, you should switch
[4887.54 --> 4891.06]  to the desktop to see how long it takes, considering it's not loaded.
[4891.70 --> 4892.06]  Oh.
[4893.20 --> 4894.10]  That's a good idea.
[4894.50 --> 4894.80]  Okay.
[4894.98 --> 4896.50]  Do you know how to switch to the desktop?
[4897.34 --> 4897.64]  Not a clue.
[4897.64 --> 4898.24]  Does anyone know?
[4898.24 --> 4899.24]  No.
[4900.92 --> 4901.92]  Not a clue at all.
[4901.96 --> 4903.96]  I was like, I'm kind of thinking I'd rather just play video games.
[4904.28 --> 4904.54]  Blah, blah.
[4904.78 --> 4905.20]  I'm assuming.
[4905.40 --> 4906.46]  Well, at the end, you know.
[4906.48 --> 4906.80]  Blah, blah.
[4908.62 --> 4908.98]  Okay.
[4909.00 --> 4909.30]  Here we go.
[4909.32 --> 4909.50]  Here we go.
[4909.50 --> 4911.30]  I'm assuming we have to close this whole thing.
[4911.38 --> 4911.82]  Here we go.
[4912.46 --> 4913.24]  In the tab screen?
[4913.32 --> 4914.46]  Apparently, it's in the tab screen.
[4914.70 --> 4921.12]  Dude, I haven't played the not like alpha development branch for so long.
[4921.12 --> 4925.34]  I barely can figure out how to do anything.
[4928.08 --> 4929.40]  This is wild.
[4929.52 --> 4930.92]  Dude, I'm so slow.
[4932.84 --> 4939.08]  I think they've juiced the Calaveras in custom game a little bit.
[4940.66 --> 4941.08]  All right.
[4941.14 --> 4941.46]  Sure.
[4941.60 --> 4942.08]  You know what?
[4942.14 --> 4942.72]  I got a goal.
[4943.18 --> 4943.44]  All right.
[4943.44 --> 4945.86]  So we're going to slide in from the right.
[4946.00 --> 4946.52]  There we go.
[4947.24 --> 4948.82]  And then, okay.
[4949.02 --> 4949.98]  Performance monitor.
[4950.20 --> 4950.32]  Okay.
[4950.32 --> 4950.80]  What's this?
[4953.30 --> 4953.66]  Anyone?
[4953.96 --> 4956.76]  Any idea how to switch to desktop?
[4959.44 --> 4959.84]  Okay.
[4959.84 --> 4960.52]  I'm going to go home.
[4961.22 --> 4961.52]  So that.
[4961.70 --> 4962.64]  They said it was an alt tab.
[4963.08 --> 4963.54]  Alt tab.
[4963.64 --> 4963.98]  Oh, okay.
[4964.02 --> 4964.20]  Cool.
[4964.30 --> 4964.44]  Okay.
[4964.44 --> 4965.22]  I'll do that in a sec.
[4965.56 --> 4966.46]  So first, hold on.
[4966.82 --> 4969.38]  I kind of, I suspended that game sort of maybe.
[4969.50 --> 4969.82]  I don't know.
[4969.88 --> 4970.20]  Did I?
[4970.56 --> 4973.30]  So if I jump back in or no, that closed the game.
[4973.38 --> 4977.08]  So it's not like, like you have on Xbox where you can like, oh, wait, no.
[4977.18 --> 4977.54]  Why is it?
[4978.46 --> 4980.02]  Oh, interesting.
[4982.16 --> 4982.52]  Okay.
[4982.88 --> 4984.26]  Well, that's pretty cool.
[4984.26 --> 4984.42]  That's pretty cool.
[4987.68 --> 4988.42]  Very cool.
[4988.50 --> 4989.40]  I mean, it makes sense, but it.
[4989.40 --> 4989.62]  Yeah.
[4989.84 --> 4990.64]  But it's cool.
[4992.60 --> 4992.88]  Yeah.
[4994.88 --> 4996.36]  I love throwing the stick, dude.
[4996.86 --> 4999.34]  I love, I love throwing the stick.
[4999.64 --> 4999.90]  Sorry.
[5000.00 --> 5000.14]  Sorry.
[5000.22 --> 5000.38]  Sorry.
[5000.44 --> 5000.60]  Sorry.
[5000.68 --> 5000.82]  Sorry.
[5001.08 --> 5001.40]  Okay.
[5001.48 --> 5002.98]  So let's do the alt tab thing.
[5003.14 --> 5004.40]  So I'm going to drag up from the bottom.
[5005.86 --> 5006.22]  Okay.
[5006.92 --> 5008.50]  And then there's a windows icon somewhere.
[5008.60 --> 5009.44]  Someone said there's a windows.
[5009.54 --> 5009.98]  There it is.
[5010.06 --> 5010.62]  Down at the bottom.
[5010.96 --> 5011.18]  Okay.
[5011.22 --> 5012.28]  So here's all my alt tabs.
[5012.68 --> 5017.40]  So armory crate, which I opened before is there settings, which I looked at before is
[5017.40 --> 5017.74]  there.
[5017.74 --> 5020.92]  I assume I can just swipe them away by throwing them away.
[5021.12 --> 5021.30]  Nope.
[5021.36 --> 5022.32]  No, it's an X in the corner.
[5022.32 --> 5026.12]  Or I can press the X button.
[5026.66 --> 5027.02]  Weird.
[5027.64 --> 5027.94]  Nope.
[5027.94 --> 5030.02]  Neither of those are actually working to close that one.
[5030.16 --> 5030.98]  I'm trying to close it.
[5031.02 --> 5032.60]  I mean, this is, this is pre-release.
[5032.70 --> 5033.24]  So let's not.
[5033.38 --> 5033.52]  Yeah.
[5033.62 --> 5033.92]  Too harsh.
[5034.80 --> 5034.96]  Yeah.
[5034.96 --> 5035.60]  Okay.
[5035.74 --> 5037.34]  So I'm going to click windows desktop now.
[5037.36 --> 5037.70]  It seems like something I can fix.
[5038.50 --> 5039.16]  I might've missed.
[5040.30 --> 5041.62]  You are exiting to desktop.
[5041.98 --> 5044.14]  You have full access to windows of blah, blah, blah.
[5044.68 --> 5044.88]  Yeah.
[5044.92 --> 5045.86]  Don't remind me of this again.
[5045.94 --> 5047.52]  There is a don't show me again button.
[5047.82 --> 5048.04]  Okay.
[5048.16 --> 5048.30]  Wow.
[5048.30 --> 5048.86]  That was fast.
[5048.88 --> 5049.40]  That was quick.
[5051.50 --> 5052.74]  Oh, and it's gone.
[5053.76 --> 5054.40]  Oh, right, right, right.
[5054.44 --> 5056.92]  Because like, obviously I still have my game open and stuff.
[5057.74 --> 5058.48]  So, okay.
[5058.54 --> 5059.52]  I don't lose my game.
[5059.78 --> 5061.96]  I can still keep playing and I can throw my stick again.
[5062.24 --> 5063.30]  And I can hit this guy.
[5063.34 --> 5063.94]  I'm going to kill him.
[5066.48 --> 5068.28]  Jump it into the corner and then go kill him.
[5069.44 --> 5071.62]  No, they're going to get a goal.
[5072.30 --> 5073.42]  No, don't get a goal.
[5074.20 --> 5074.52]  Sorry.
[5074.62 --> 5074.80]  Sorry.
[5074.84 --> 5075.86]  I'll stop playing video games now.
[5075.92 --> 5076.88]  Anyway, it's a really fun game.
[5076.90 --> 5077.78]  I've been enjoying it.
[5079.02 --> 5079.34]  Yeah.
[5080.14 --> 5082.00]  Oh, I got two with the stick throw.
[5083.12 --> 5083.98]  Took him out.
[5086.92 --> 5087.92]  Boom.
[5089.68 --> 5090.26]  Got her.
[5091.68 --> 5092.10]  Boom.
[5093.10 --> 5093.36]  Sorry.
[5093.52 --> 5093.70]  Sorry.
[5093.78 --> 5094.20]  I'm done now.
[5094.52 --> 5097.28]  You know how I like that show, Shorzy?
[5097.66 --> 5098.02]  Yep.
[5098.92 --> 5100.90]  You know they released a hockey game?
[5101.58 --> 5102.24]  No way.
[5103.10 --> 5104.24]  Shorzy hockey game?
[5105.58 --> 5106.00]  Yeah.
[5106.12 --> 5107.06]  Is it supposed to be good?
[5107.06 --> 5107.56]  I'm going to find it.
[5110.38 --> 5110.82]  No.
[5111.46 --> 5112.70]  Oh, that's unfortunate.
[5112.70 --> 5114.68]  It has mostly positive reviews now.
[5116.92 --> 5119.64]  Yeah.
[5119.70 --> 5119.96]  Okay.
[5120.04 --> 5123.02]  One of the positive reviews says it looks promising when it's completed.
[5123.16 --> 5124.38]  It's currently in early access.
[5124.58 --> 5127.96]  I really wish they just partnered with Tape2Tape.
[5129.10 --> 5137.92]  Because honestly, playing the Shorzy game, I think I played it for like 10 minutes and then was like, uh...
[5137.92 --> 5140.76]  Nah.
[5141.56 --> 5142.64]  Oh, that's a bummer.
[5143.76 --> 5144.12]  Yeah.
[5144.32 --> 5145.16]  I mean, this is cool.
[5146.28 --> 5148.22]  Like, actual fight in a boxing ring.
[5148.90 --> 5150.06]  I mean, I didn't get that far.
[5150.34 --> 5150.98]  I will admit.
[5152.02 --> 5152.36]  Okay.
[5152.54 --> 5153.86]  I mean, maybe we should give it a shot.
[5153.92 --> 5154.66]  Is it single player?
[5156.56 --> 5158.16]  It definitely has single player.
[5158.16 --> 5159.16]  I think it also has...
[5159.16 --> 5159.18]  Yeah.
[5159.28 --> 5159.46]  Yeah.
[5159.52 --> 5160.50]  Co-op and PvP.
[5160.66 --> 5161.16]  Okay, cool.
[5161.16 --> 5165.94]  I think I'll give it time at least until it's out of early access to like really cast judgment.
[5166.16 --> 5169.92]  But right now, it doesn't seem that amazing.
[5170.18 --> 5171.12]  39 reviews.
[5171.24 --> 5172.54]  That's about 2,000 sales.
[5172.74 --> 5174.16]  So, not super popular.
[5174.68 --> 5174.96]  Okay.
[5175.86 --> 5176.26]  Yeah.
[5176.28 --> 5178.70]  I don't think they've really been promoting it a ton yet.
[5179.56 --> 5179.96]  Yeah.
[5180.00 --> 5183.66]  Maybe they'll promote it more when it's like actually done and not like bad.
[5184.60 --> 5184.88]  Yeah.
[5185.36 --> 5188.74]  Or maybe they realize it's bad and it'll be bad forever and they're just not going to promote it.
[5188.74 --> 5189.14]  You never know.
[5189.22 --> 5190.58]  Early access is a...
[5190.58 --> 5193.12]  It's a very mixed bag.
[5193.50 --> 5194.84]  Like, tape to tape's early access.
[5195.38 --> 5200.86]  Luke and I have talked about it and like he thinks it could have just been tape to tape one.
[5201.66 --> 5202.74]  I absolutely think that.
[5202.78 --> 5207.02]  And all the work that they've done since then could have just been tape to tape two.
[5207.58 --> 5209.52]  Dude, it's a dramatically different game.
[5209.52 --> 5212.94]  And people were very happy with what it already was.
[5214.72 --> 5215.52]  It's interesting.
[5215.52 --> 5220.40]  But like, I'm just saying like if Shorzy paired with them to just make like an alternate campaign,
[5220.56 --> 5222.74]  I think that would have been awesome.
[5222.76 --> 5224.04]  Oh, as like a Shorzy DLC.
[5224.90 --> 5225.10]  Yeah.
[5225.12 --> 5225.94]  Or something like that.
[5226.08 --> 5226.40]  Yeah.
[5226.54 --> 5233.78]  I mean, Excellent Rectangle is like still balls deep in development of just the base game as it is.
[5233.90 --> 5239.40]  So, they're probably a little ways off from like partnering on skins and DLCs and whatever.
[5239.56 --> 5243.62]  I don't even know if they have any capability of adding that kind of stuff in the future.
[5243.62 --> 5247.16]  But yeah, they seem like super cool guys.
[5248.24 --> 5248.56]  Yeah.
[5249.06 --> 5250.80]  And very responsive in their Discord.
[5251.20 --> 5254.82]  I was complaining about the behavior of the defenseman in the trio mode.
[5255.20 --> 5256.68]  So, that's when you're playing with just three players.
[5256.92 --> 5257.42]  Oh, uh-oh.
[5257.50 --> 5257.76]  What now?
[5258.68 --> 5262.30]  No, I just thought like while we're talking about games, I should give another shout out.
[5262.40 --> 5263.08]  I don't know if I actually...
[5263.08 --> 5269.48]  Did I talk about the very pod racing-esque game that I found at PAX?
[5269.48 --> 5271.48]  Maybe?
[5272.64 --> 5273.62]  I'm not sure if I remember.
[5273.84 --> 5274.48]  Do you know what it's called?
[5274.56 --> 5281.18]  So, when I went to PAX, the most standout game to me was a game called Ascent Rivals.
[5281.68 --> 5284.96]  Um, A-S-C-E-N-T.
[5284.96 --> 5285.68]  I know how to spell Ascent.
[5285.68 --> 5286.06]  Rivals.
[5286.06 --> 5290.16]  I was partially saying that to myself.
[5290.96 --> 5292.68]  Do they have a good trailer?
[5293.08 --> 5293.82]  I'm checking right now.
[5293.90 --> 5294.60]  Yeah, it looks like it.
[5295.06 --> 5296.52]  I'm playing the trailer right now, sir.
[5297.16 --> 5299.46]  So, the gameplay of this...
[5299.46 --> 5302.72]  So far, this doesn't really show what it's actually like to play the game at all.
[5304.08 --> 5304.36]  Okay.
[5305.84 --> 5307.32]  Dual engine controls.
[5307.50 --> 5309.14]  Man, are they going to really show ever?
[5309.14 --> 5310.14]  Uh...
[5310.14 --> 5313.74]  I mean, this is definitely pod racing.
[5315.28 --> 5320.14]  Yeah, so I never have seen any of the, like, gunplay stuff.
[5320.32 --> 5321.62]  I have only seen the racing.
[5322.54 --> 5328.96]  And if you join their Discord, I think it is, you can get access to this game for free right now.
[5329.62 --> 5329.88]  Really?
[5330.38 --> 5331.42]  As, like, a test.
[5332.70 --> 5333.80]  This looks awesome.
[5333.80 --> 5334.44]  Their Discord's really awesome.
[5334.96 --> 5336.86]  People have tournaments all the time.
[5336.86 --> 5337.86]  Um...
[5337.86 --> 5340.30]  The mechanics are really cool.
[5340.46 --> 5342.36]  It felt really intuitive to me.
[5342.68 --> 5343.44]  Um...
[5343.44 --> 5345.60]  Which was odd, because they're very weird.
[5345.74 --> 5346.54]  But...
[5346.54 --> 5348.46]  You have, like, grav control.
[5348.58 --> 5349.34]  So, like, gravity.
[5349.76 --> 5350.28]  Um...
[5350.28 --> 5351.94]  On each side of your ship.
[5352.12 --> 5356.28]  So, if you pull the right trigger, the right side of your ship will be pulled to the ground.
[5356.84 --> 5357.20]  Interesting.
[5357.20 --> 5360.02]  If you pull the left trigger, the left side of your ship will be pulled to the ground.
[5360.10 --> 5360.30]  Right.
[5360.30 --> 5361.66]  And then your thumbsticks...
[5361.66 --> 5363.02]  It's just forward and back.
[5364.00 --> 5365.76]  They have a public play test right now.
[5365.76 --> 5366.76]  Yeah.
[5366.76 --> 5367.04]  You can just...
[5367.04 --> 5367.36]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5367.36 --> 5368.02]  You can just join it.
[5368.02 --> 5368.98]  You can jump on it.
[5369.32 --> 5369.64]  Um...
[5369.64 --> 5373.62]  So, if you press forward on a thumbstick, that is engine full thrust.
[5373.80 --> 5376.20]  If you pull back, it's engine off.
[5376.28 --> 5376.76]  That's it.
[5376.94 --> 5378.58]  So, you don't have turn left, turn right.
[5378.94 --> 5379.36]  You have to, like...
[5379.36 --> 5379.40]  Oh, sick!
[5379.40 --> 5384.14]  If you want to turn right, you want to turn the engine on the right off and pull the gravity
[5384.14 --> 5387.18]  down on the right in order to, like, twist around a corner.
[5387.76 --> 5388.76]  Um...
[5388.76 --> 5390.68]  Very, very fun.
[5390.82 --> 5392.40]  I had a really good time with it.
[5392.44 --> 5395.50]  It's the most fun racing game I've played in a really long time.
[5396.16 --> 5398.28]  And it's, like, super, super early on.
[5399.28 --> 5399.96]  Um...
[5399.96 --> 5401.00]  People say with both sticks...
[5401.00 --> 5405.74]  Yeah, you need both sticks and both triggers to be able to control your ship.
[5406.00 --> 5407.24]  I don't remember what they actually call them.
[5407.24 --> 5409.70]  So, again, to go straight, you would...
[5410.58 --> 5411.10]  Uh...
[5411.10 --> 5414.86]  I think you would be on both triggers and forward on both thumbsticks because you're pulling
[5414.86 --> 5418.10]  yourself tight to the ground, which would benefit going fast.
[5418.24 --> 5419.60]  And both your engines are on.
[5419.88 --> 5426.96]  Then if you wanted to turn right, you would either just grab right, which would mean letting
[5426.96 --> 5431.68]  go of your left trigger in order to stop the gravity on the left side of your ship to
[5431.68 --> 5433.42]  turn that way with full possible speed.
[5433.42 --> 5437.14]  Or if it's a tighter turn, you would let go of the...
[5437.14 --> 5443.14]  Or potentially pull back on the thumbstick on your right side and let go of the trigger
[5443.14 --> 5444.00]  on your left side.
[5444.32 --> 5445.78]  So, it's, like, you're...
[5445.78 --> 5447.06]  It's so interesting.
[5447.20 --> 5448.24]  It's very, very unique.
[5448.36 --> 5449.02]  It's really fun.
[5449.32 --> 5454.42]  They also have this system where you can turn off your engines by pulling both the thumbsticks
[5454.42 --> 5454.84]  back.
[5455.02 --> 5458.82]  And then you slam them forward and it gives you, like, a short warp.
[5459.30 --> 5463.40]  So, like, if you're going and you go over a gap while you're floating in the middle of
[5463.40 --> 5467.30]  the air, you can turn your engines off and then slam them back on the second you land
[5467.30 --> 5468.72]  and you go super, super fast, really quick.
[5468.98 --> 5469.40]  It's very...
[5469.92 --> 5473.52]  It feels very, like, very active.
[5473.66 --> 5476.40]  So, basically, it's my Tycho Scorcher.
[5481.80 --> 5482.16]  What?
[5482.16 --> 5482.52]  What?
[5482.98 --> 5490.92]  So, this is an RC toy that I got for, like, a mega special Christmas present when I was
[5490.92 --> 5491.40]  a kid.
[5492.32 --> 5501.60]  And it was, like, six wheels, which they advertised as six by six, I think, which is not how that
[5501.60 --> 5502.46]  works at all.
[5502.56 --> 5502.86]  No.
[5503.88 --> 5504.94]  I had the green one.
[5505.04 --> 5505.46]  I thought...
[5505.46 --> 5508.60]  I could have sworn it was called Monster, but this is definitely the car.
[5508.60 --> 5511.22]  Like, I recognized the car for sure.
[5511.70 --> 5519.48]  And it had dual forward and back sticks for control, which my friends found extremely confusing,
[5519.74 --> 5521.72]  but to me was always very intuitive.
[5522.08 --> 5525.88]  So, the right stick drove the right wheel and the left stick drove the left wheel.
[5526.50 --> 5526.62]  Yeah.
[5526.62 --> 5531.98]  And unfortunately, and this was not something that they made clear in the advertising for
[5531.98 --> 5536.24]  this thing, but it only drove the middle wheel on both sides.
[5536.24 --> 5539.74]  So, these were just for stability wheels.
[5540.56 --> 5541.82]  So, it's not six by six.
[5541.92 --> 5543.06]  It's, like, one by two.
[5543.16 --> 5546.88]  And the battery lasted for about six minutes.
[5547.04 --> 5548.80]  Anyway, sorry.
[5548.92 --> 5550.46]  Yes, that sounds like a really cool game.
[5550.58 --> 5553.02]  And the gameplay looks, honestly, amazing.
[5554.02 --> 5554.34]  Man.
[5554.42 --> 5555.48]  It was really fun.
[5555.54 --> 5557.40]  I haven't played all the features yet, all that kind of stuff.
[5557.46 --> 5561.96]  I didn't have a ton of time to play it before I started going on many trips and my whole
[5561.96 --> 5562.72]  house fell apart.
[5562.90 --> 5568.32]  But anyways, but I had a ton of fun with it for the, like, one night that I could play.
[5568.46 --> 5569.98]  And I'm really excited to get back into it.
[5570.24 --> 5574.44]  I got on the leaderboard for one of the maps, which felt really cool.
[5574.78 --> 5577.96]  There's, I was watching some of the, like, record runs.
[5578.12 --> 5582.24]  And it's a lot of kind of just turning your engines off and back on again to do the warp
[5582.24 --> 5582.62]  mechanics.
[5582.62 --> 5586.90]  So, I sort of hope the balance changes there to be more based around, like, tight cornering
[5586.90 --> 5587.26]  and stuff.
[5587.40 --> 5587.58]  Yeah.
[5587.82 --> 5588.78]  And, like, drifting.
[5589.04 --> 5591.70]  Are they working on, like, co-op, like, two-player pods?
[5591.84 --> 5594.90]  So, you could have, like, a gunner and...
[5596.28 --> 5599.08]  I honestly don't know.
[5600.48 --> 5603.16]  I talked to one of the guys for a while, but it's been a bit...
[5603.16 --> 5605.84]  Like, I saw sniping going on.
[5605.92 --> 5606.06]  Yes.
[5606.06 --> 5606.88]  Is that...
[5606.88 --> 5608.54]  But you do that as the pilot?
[5609.20 --> 5610.22]  I think that's you.
[5610.22 --> 5614.02]  I think you, like, relinquish controls of the ship for a second and then shoot and then
[5614.02 --> 5614.58]  keep going.
[5614.82 --> 5615.02]  Okay.
[5615.02 --> 5616.36]  There's a lot of damage mechanics.
[5616.68 --> 5620.00]  Using the warp thing, if I remember correctly, damages your engines to a certain degree.
[5620.34 --> 5622.08]  Bashing into walls damages your engines.
[5622.34 --> 5627.68]  And you can blow up, which, you know, is interesting.
[5628.10 --> 5633.26]  I think they have, like, battle royale modes, but they also just have races, which I'm pretty
[5633.26 --> 5635.16]  sure don't involve the combat.
[5635.44 --> 5638.56]  So, if you just want to zoom around, that's definitely an option.
[5638.56 --> 5640.78]  All I've really done is, like, solo time trials.
[5640.78 --> 5646.84]  Um, but, yeah, dude, a two-player...
[5646.84 --> 5650.96]  Yeah, so, uh, Tim000x3 in full-paint chat said double dash.
[5651.22 --> 5654.58]  A two-player where you're in one ship I think would be super fun.
[5654.94 --> 5660.06]  Something that I thought was really interesting was I noticed on their website they have their,
[5660.06 --> 5660.80]  like, sponsors.
[5660.80 --> 5663.68]  And some of them kind of make sense.
[5663.76 --> 5665.10]  Like, okay, Starforge is there.
[5665.22 --> 5666.12]  MSI is there.
[5666.12 --> 5670.24]  But then there's Dirtfish, Shelby, and Selene.
[5671.62 --> 5674.32]  Shelby, like, like, like Mustang?
[5675.22 --> 5675.56]  Yeah.
[5675.56 --> 5682.14]  I have no idea what's going on here.
[5682.38 --> 5686.56]  Someone has a relative who works it for.
[5686.88 --> 5687.56]  Like, I...
[5687.56 --> 5689.32]  And, like, Dirtfish, too.
[5689.50 --> 5692.12]  Like, the whole thing is, uh...
[5692.12 --> 5694.04]  It's really interesting.
[5694.42 --> 5697.62]  I don't know what's going on here, but I'm very excited about the future of this game.
[5697.86 --> 5701.44]  Um, and I hope that people try it out and have fun.
[5702.40 --> 5703.32]  All right, cool.
[5703.32 --> 5707.30]  Uh, why don't I pick the next one?
[5709.34 --> 5712.50]  Meta has unveiled the Meta Ray-Ban display.
[5713.34 --> 5719.32]  Meta announced its first consumer glasses with a built-in display at Wednesday's Meta Connect 2025 event.
[5719.32 --> 5725.04]  The Meta Ray-Ban display glasses have a 600x600 full-color display in the right eye
[5725.04 --> 5728.66]  that apparently reaches 5,000 nits
[5728.66 --> 5732.88]  and is reportedly almost undetectable when you are not wearing the glasses.
[5733.32 --> 5738.06]  It's paired with the neural band worn on the wrist, which can control the glasses via finger movements,
[5738.26 --> 5741.98]  and you can even input text by handwriting on a surface with your finger.
[5742.98 --> 5745.94]  That sounds horrible, but better than nothing.
[5746.54 --> 5749.44]  Another big feature is live translate and live captions.
[5749.58 --> 5753.56]  It can apparently display captions only for the person that you are talking to,
[5753.56 --> 5760.16]  which as far as accessibility features go could be an absolute game changer for like literally millions of people.
[5760.94 --> 5764.96]  Um, the glasses drop in the US on September 30th for $800
[5764.96 --> 5770.48]  and sales will expand to Canada, France, Italy, and the UK early next year.
[5770.48 --> 5774.18]  Also, it has a rechargeable and foldable case, which is pretty cool.
[5774.74 --> 5780.32]  Meta also updated their non-display AI glasses with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 at $380
[5780.32 --> 5785.58]  and the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses that are marketed toward the fitness crowd,
[5785.68 --> 5786.62]  like runners and bikers.
[5787.02 --> 5790.46]  These glasses can be integrated with Garmin, smartwatches, and Strava.
[5791.56 --> 5793.18]  Um, is it happening?
[5793.18 --> 5797.90]  Like, is this the moment when you even consider them?
[5798.44 --> 5801.10]  I know, but let's put aside that it's meta for a second.
[5804.38 --> 5805.76]  Yeah, yeah, okay.
[5805.86 --> 5807.76]  That's a good put aside because I was gonna,
[5807.82 --> 5810.94]  I was gonna prequel it with like no chance not from them.
[5811.40 --> 5815.38]  Um, it's definitely getting interesting.
[5815.88 --> 5818.70]  I think we're actually pretty far out still, personally.
[5819.34 --> 5819.82]  Um.
[5819.92 --> 5821.80]  Man, rebrands work, dude.
[5821.80 --> 5824.48]  I hate that they work, but there's a couple people in floatplane chat.
[5824.56 --> 5825.28]  They're like, who's Meta?
[5825.58 --> 5826.38]  Meta's Facebook.
[5827.40 --> 5828.84]  And don't kid yourself.
[5829.30 --> 5829.96]  They're Facebook.
[5830.92 --> 5831.26]  Yeah.
[5831.42 --> 5831.64]  Yeah.
[5833.70 --> 5836.78]  Yeah, I think, I think the sports ones are pretty interesting.
[5836.78 --> 5843.80]  I saw, uh, at, uh, IFA, I saw a pair of glasses that look extremely similar to these Oakleys.
[5844.02 --> 5844.14]  Yep.
[5844.42 --> 5851.78]  Um, and it kind of made a bunch of sense to me in regards to like being able to record your run
[5851.78 --> 5852.92]  and do things like that.
[5852.96 --> 5853.16]  Yep.
[5853.60 --> 5854.04]  Um.
[5854.22 --> 5858.50]  Or, I mean, it could even just be like, man, it's a wild world that we're living in.
[5858.96 --> 5861.46]  Is it a terrible idea to take a dash cam out with you?
[5862.92 --> 5863.32]  You know?
[5863.52 --> 5864.30]  Yeah, it's really not.
[5864.56 --> 5864.74]  Yeah.
[5864.80 --> 5865.04]  Okay.
[5865.04 --> 5868.06]  And by run, I meant your ride, I guess.
[5868.28 --> 5871.04]  The, the example in the photo is someone on a bike and that makes sense.
[5871.08 --> 5871.52]  Either way.
[5871.52 --> 5871.68]  Yeah.
[5871.80 --> 5878.02]  I'm just saying like having a, having a, an everyday dash cam for life honestly doesn't
[5878.02 --> 5880.00]  seem like the worst idea in the world.
[5881.46 --> 5882.80]  Dash cam for your life.
[5882.88 --> 5885.70]  It feels like it's a, it's a sales tagline for these.
[5885.88 --> 5886.66]  To be honest.
[5886.66 --> 5889.10]  Purchase now comes with free bulletproof vest.
[5890.20 --> 5891.28]  Oh, no.
[5892.02 --> 5892.80]  Oh, God.
[5895.50 --> 5896.22]  Oh, man.
[5896.24 --> 5897.00]  Oh, man.
[5897.00 --> 5898.52]  I mean, a vest doesn't really seem like enough.
[5898.60 --> 5900.14]  It seems like enough to be a turtleneck.
[5900.76 --> 5902.80]  You want it to be really effective.
[5904.72 --> 5906.44]  It's a dangerous world out there, man.
[5906.44 --> 5906.56]  Oh, yeah.
[5906.56 --> 5906.58]  Okay.
[5906.58 --> 5908.30]  So, so, so, so Linus did it.
[5908.70 --> 5909.36]  I did what?
[5909.48 --> 5912.82]  I was going to text you guys that joke because I didn't want to say it.
[5912.98 --> 5913.86]  That's not a joke.
[5913.86 --> 5915.30]  That's serious.
[5915.96 --> 5919.80]  Like it's a, it's a, it's a wild, dangerous time, man.
[5920.56 --> 5922.34]  Yeah, that's true.
[5925.12 --> 5925.52]  Wow.
[5925.80 --> 5926.86]  Off rails a bit.
[5927.02 --> 5927.20]  Yeah.
[5927.30 --> 5932.62]  It's like we, we saw one of these glasses, not, not the ones that I was talking about that
[5932.62 --> 5935.00]  looked like the Ray-Ban ones, but we saw another brand of these.
[5935.00 --> 5938.60]  I think it was TCL at IFA.
[5938.92 --> 5942.34]  And I really, I don't think they're ready yet.
[5942.34 --> 5947.18]  I think the neural band thing is an interesting idea, but I think the ultimate winner here
[5947.18 --> 5950.48]  is going to be someone who just already has a good smartwatch that can integrate with
[5950.48 --> 5952.08]  the glass as well.
[5952.24 --> 5952.44]  Yep.
[5953.12 --> 5957.56]  Instead of like this unique band that you only really use with your glasses.
[5957.56 --> 5960.44]  Like this is what I kind of mean by, I think we're still pretty far out.
[5960.72 --> 5963.68]  I think we're getting to the point where for certain early adopters, these are going
[5963.68 --> 5964.12]  to be cool.
[5964.32 --> 5966.44]  I already know people that wear the metaglasses and like them.
[5966.56 --> 5966.84]  Yep.
[5967.12 --> 5968.26]  But not very many.
[5968.40 --> 5969.40]  Taryn's a daily driver.
[5969.40 --> 5971.06]  I know Artie's a daily driver.
[5972.16 --> 5976.76]  I've actually got a pair sitting on my dresser at home that every day I get up in the morning
[5976.76 --> 5980.36]  and I look at and I'm like, okay, I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to try them.
[5980.66 --> 5980.90]  Right?
[5980.96 --> 5986.70]  Like I, how, how can I, how can I be incredibly a gadget guy and not have tried them at this
[5986.70 --> 5986.90]  point?
[5986.94 --> 5989.10]  They have that much acceptance at the very least.
[5991.60 --> 5992.00]  Yeah.
[5992.24 --> 5992.62]  Yeah.
[5992.68 --> 5994.92]  It's, they're, they're interesting.
[5994.92 --> 5998.98]  I think mass market appeal, I think we're still pretty far out personally.
[6000.30 --> 6003.40]  But they're definitely hitting the, the, the niche crowd.
[6003.54 --> 6004.98]  And I'm not surprised.
[6005.10 --> 6010.40]  I would not be surprised if like, you know, these gen twos hit an even wider audience.
[6010.40 --> 6022.02]  Um, we've talked extensively about what we would want out of smart glasses.
[6022.18 --> 6022.66]  Right.
[6022.72 --> 6028.12]  And both you and I have discussed how we just have terrible memories for faces.
[6028.22 --> 6028.94]  Digital Rolodex.
[6029.42 --> 6030.62]  Digital Rolodex.
[6031.56 --> 6032.08]  Okay.
[6033.08 --> 6035.80]  Luke, this is a, this is a big question.
[6035.80 --> 6039.18]  Would you buy the product that you want?
[6039.34 --> 6044.04]  You know, the one that we've been asking for, for 10 years, would you buy it?
[6044.36 --> 6045.76]  If it came from Facebook.
[6047.26 --> 6053.94]  Bearing in mind, Luke, and this is very important that almost no other company on earth would
[6053.94 --> 6057.38]  have enough personal information from everyone to build it.
[6057.38 --> 6064.54]  One of the, one of the whack parts about this is, and something that might make me say no,
[6065.06 --> 6070.74]  is that while you and I have also discussed about how like our privacy is basically just
[6070.74 --> 6073.32]  null and void at this point.
[6073.68 --> 6078.12]  Um, like almost what's the point in, in defending certain levels of it?
[6078.18 --> 6083.50]  Obviously there's certain levels which will, um, always be defended, but there's, there's a
[6083.50 --> 6084.58]  lot of it that's just out there.
[6084.58 --> 6088.74]  But the, the problem is that this is other people's privacy.
[6089.40 --> 6095.64]  Um, which, which I think would still kind of hold me off or would result in me only
[6095.64 --> 6097.42]  wearing them in certain situations.
[6097.96 --> 6104.44]  Um, like if it's a digital Rolodex thing and I wear it to CES, um, I don't think I'm that
[6104.44 --> 6105.56]  bothered by that use case.
[6105.64 --> 6109.50]  Like at trade shows, places where there's very little expectation of privacy.
[6109.68 --> 6110.82]  There's cameras everywhere.
[6110.98 --> 6113.68]  Everyone's expecting recordings to be going on.
[6113.68 --> 6118.02]  If you think you have a level of privacy on the shore at a show floor of any kind, I think
[6118.02 --> 6118.86]  you're just being silly.
[6119.48 --> 6121.76]  Um, I think that's okay.
[6121.76 --> 6125.88]  But in day-to-day life, like going to dinner with someone or hanging out with friends, I
[6125.88 --> 6127.42]  think it would still weird me out.
[6127.80 --> 6130.52]  Um, no local processing.
[6130.52 --> 6131.08]  Yeah.
[6131.08 --> 6136.14]  Like if, if these aren't processing locally through a connection to my phone or something,
[6136.14 --> 6144.52]  um, then there is a compromise of other people's privacy that is potentially going on.
[6144.56 --> 6145.44]  And I don't like that.
[6145.60 --> 6152.04]  I XFN 724 says you will have an ad strapped to your face at some point and brings up that.
[6152.04 --> 6156.06]  And this isn't actually in the topics this week, but Samsung has apparently confirmed
[6156.06 --> 6160.94]  that their expensive smart fridges are now going to start serving ads to you in your
[6160.94 --> 6161.26]  kitchen.
[6161.26 --> 6164.16]  Like when is it enough?
[6165.60 --> 6166.04]  Yeah.
[6166.08 --> 6167.98]  I maintain, give me the dumbest fridge possible.
[6167.98 --> 6172.00]  I don't, I don't want a fridge with a screen because anything with a screen that also has an
[6172.00 --> 6174.24]  internet connection will eventually receive an ad.
[6174.24 --> 6176.64]  And I just don't want it.
[6178.10 --> 6178.54]  Yikes.
[6180.40 --> 6182.26]  Oh, we're supposed to do sponsors now.
[6182.56 --> 6185.38]  Speaking of ads, the show is brought to you by Odoo.
[6185.88 --> 6187.92]  Is life hitting you fast and furious?
[6188.06 --> 6189.06]  Oh, can we use this?
[6190.30 --> 6190.70]  Uh.
[6193.44 --> 6193.84]  Dan?
[6195.00 --> 6196.50]  I don't, I don't write these.
[6198.20 --> 6199.10]  Uh, okay.
[6199.42 --> 6199.78]  Uh.
[6200.14 --> 6200.62]  I think you do.
[6200.74 --> 6203.38]  Leaving you with no time to manage your business?
[6204.24 --> 6209.58]  By unifying your processes and apps with the help of Odoo, you can spend time, less time
[6209.58 --> 6211.66]  doing things and more time getting things done.
[6212.56 --> 6217.38]  Organize your sales team with their CRM app, which you can use to, sorry, I'm still thrown
[6217.38 --> 6221.64]  off, which can help you schedule calls, send quotes and invoices and adjust your pipeline.
[6222.32 --> 6226.50]  And you can make sure the math is mathing with their feature packed accounting app.
[6227.10 --> 6230.88]  For something really custom, you can even design your own app in Odoo Studio.
[6230.88 --> 6235.06]  But what if you only need one app to plug that leak in your processes?
[6235.88 --> 6239.86]  Good for you, because you can get, oh man, sorry.
[6240.46 --> 6245.02]  Good thing, because you can get unlimited access to any single Odoo app for free.
[6245.40 --> 6250.34]  So use our link in the description for a free 15-day unrestricted trial of Odoo's entire
[6250.34 --> 6253.86]  suite and see for yourself just how much time you could possibly be saving.
[6253.86 --> 6258.92]  Okay, the show is also brought to you by Vessi.
[6260.62 --> 6265.64]  Weekends are typically reserved for alternative activities.
[6266.48 --> 6271.56]  And unlike with a pair of heavy-duty boots, Vessi's weekend sneakers can let you do it in
[6271.56 --> 6275.02]  style, all well covered by their dry sock guarantee.
[6275.02 --> 6280.86]  Using their patented material called Dymotex, they, like the rest of Vessi's lineup, are
[6280.86 --> 6285.00]  designed to help keep moisture out while letting heat and sweat escape.
[6285.52 --> 6290.40]  They're fashion-forward, easy to slip on and off, and have a thicker cushioning midsole for
[6290.40 --> 6291.60]  more comfort and support.
[6292.04 --> 6296.20]  With a one-year warranty, 30 days of returns and exchanges, and free shipping on orders
[6296.20 --> 6300.44]  over $110, there's no good reason not to try out a pair.
[6300.44 --> 6307.90]  So save 15% off today by heading to Vessi.com slash LTT or by clicking our link in the description.
[6310.26 --> 6313.34]  Finally, the show is brought to you by AMD.
[6314.42 --> 6319.04]  Josh's AMD upgrade is now live and available for your viewing pleasure.
[6319.48 --> 6322.70]  It's a perfect treat for the start of the back-to-school season.
[6323.38 --> 6325.64]  It says, talk briefly about upgrade.
[6325.82 --> 6329.02]  This one was wild.
[6329.02 --> 6333.60]  Josh has worked here for years now, but he always worked under Yvonne.
[6333.84 --> 6340.02]  So I honestly had my first conversation with him that was longer than 10 seconds, like
[6340.02 --> 6341.14]  a month ago.
[6342.10 --> 6350.92]  I just didn't know the guy because while I will go out of my way to do temperature checks or
[6350.92 --> 6358.02]  get to know yous with people in other managers' departments, just so that I know, Yvonne and
[6358.02 --> 6359.24]  I are basically the same person.
[6359.60 --> 6364.86]  So if she's on it, then I just, I consider it onned.
[6365.48 --> 6368.44]  And I'm like, okay, yep, your team's good.
[6368.56 --> 6368.84]  Good.
[6369.10 --> 6369.54]  See you later.
[6369.80 --> 6373.08]  Because you can't have, you can't have relationships with everyone.
[6373.26 --> 6375.60]  Like it's, it's very challenging.
[6375.60 --> 6381.00]  So Josh was a bit of a black box for me going into his upgrade a couple of weeks ago when
[6381.00 --> 6381.56]  we shot it.
[6381.74 --> 6384.84]  And he is still an enigma.
[6386.86 --> 6389.62]  Luke, have you watched Josh's AMD upgrade?
[6390.54 --> 6392.12]  No, I saw it go up, but I haven't seen it.
[6392.16 --> 6393.68]  I watch all of them, but I haven't seen it yet.
[6393.76 --> 6394.68]  How about you, Dan?
[6395.60 --> 6396.88]  I have not, no.
[6397.10 --> 6397.50]  Okay.
[6397.50 --> 6399.16]  I skipped through some of it this morning.
[6399.26 --> 6400.44]  I saw there was burgers.
[6401.12 --> 6401.56]  Yeah.
[6401.72 --> 6402.90]  And things.
[6403.22 --> 6408.60]  So Josh's house is like what I imagine the inside of my brain would look like.
[6410.54 --> 6414.30]  It is literally piled.
[6414.30 --> 6420.44]  Luke, do you remember when we did a small renovation back when we were working out of my garage,
[6420.88 --> 6425.88]  like at, at my house, uh, for, for, for Linus Media Group.
[6426.18 --> 6430.70]  Do you remember when that one time, I wish I'd taken a picture of it because it was so funny,
[6430.78 --> 6435.40]  where we had to move everything out of the garage so we could do something.
[6435.40 --> 6438.92]  We were painting or building a set or building the tech quickie set.
[6439.14 --> 6439.38]  Sure.
[6439.90 --> 6444.04]  We had to move everything into my living room and my living room was just piled with
[6444.04 --> 6444.52]  boxes.
[6445.28 --> 6445.44]  Yeah.
[6446.36 --> 6446.80]  Yeah.
[6447.12 --> 6447.96]  That's how he lives.
[6447.96 --> 6448.76]  That's just his house.
[6448.88 --> 6449.04]  Yeah.
[6449.10 --> 6449.84]  That's how he lives.
[6450.76 --> 6456.82]  There's a, there's a half of a finished project literally within reach at any given moment.
[6457.24 --> 6461.44]  Piles of paint cans, uh, like an MDF hand-built dresser.
[6461.66 --> 6464.50]  He, he is like DIY king.
[6464.50 --> 6469.34]  Like if there is something that he can do himself, he does it himself.
[6469.60 --> 6472.22]  And I assume he'll finish it eventually.
[6472.22 --> 6478.28]  And, and I didn't realize like how, how much of a passion he has for learning how to do
[6478.28 --> 6482.24]  things and then getting bored of them and moving on to the next thing.
[6482.24 --> 6489.84]  Um, so it was, it was a lot of fun and I, I, I love, I love doing these series because
[6489.84 --> 6494.44]  it really gives me an opportunity to get to know people that I otherwise would not really
[6494.44 --> 6496.62]  get a chance to, to get to know.
[6497.06 --> 6502.84]  Um, anyway, to go along with this upgrade, AMD of course has another amazing giveaway for
[6502.84 --> 6503.04]  you.
[6503.10 --> 6508.24]  But before that they want us, either of us to tell a quick story about juggling gaming
[6508.24 --> 6509.06]  while in school.
[6509.06 --> 6511.20]  AMD, you already got to talk briefly about the upgrade.
[6511.30 --> 6512.12]  I'm not doing that today.
[6513.12 --> 6514.38]  Uh, that was riveting.
[6514.60 --> 6517.94]  At least I'm assuming it was hard to tell when writing these talking points without knowing
[6517.94 --> 6518.82]  what y'all are going to say.
[6518.90 --> 6520.02]  It turns out the answer was nothing.
[6520.20 --> 6523.34]  Anyway, AMD is giving you a chance to upgrade your PC.
[6523.80 --> 6526.58]  That we're sure is definitely meant for school.
[6526.72 --> 6526.94]  Yes.
[6527.08 --> 6527.34]  Yes.
[6527.62 --> 6534.56]  With a bundle that includes a Ryzen 7 9800 X3D, a motherboard and 32 gigs of RAM.
[6534.78 --> 6537.50]  You can enter the giveaway by using our link in the description.
[6537.50 --> 6539.46]  Good luck and thanks again.
[6539.64 --> 6544.44]  AMD, the AMD Ultimate Tech Upgrade Series is really one of my favorites and I think that's
[6544.44 --> 6548.56]  true of a lot of you as well based on, based on your, your comments.
[6549.92 --> 6550.82]  All right.
[6551.50 --> 6552.82]  Want to pick another topic, Luke?
[6553.88 --> 6554.36]  Sure.
[6554.88 --> 6556.02]  Let's see here.
[6556.60 --> 6557.46]  What do we got?
[6558.50 --> 6560.42]  Uh, let's do another fun one.
[6560.50 --> 6561.50]  The Linus size screwdriver.
[6561.50 --> 6562.08]  Screwdriver.
[6562.18 --> 6563.82]  Oh, I thought you were going to do the Moflin.
[6565.24 --> 6566.34]  Oh, we could do that?
[6566.48 --> 6568.04]  No, let's do the Linus size screwdriver.
[6568.82 --> 6569.20]  All right.
[6569.30 --> 6573.38]  Reddit user KentonBomb84 used their custom made printer.
[6573.64 --> 6574.24]  Oh, that's cool.
[6574.28 --> 6575.22]  I didn't actually realize that part.
[6575.44 --> 6577.96]  To print a Linus sized shaft.
[6578.64 --> 6580.72]  Specifically, the screwdriver shaft.
[6580.72 --> 6583.34]  And the whole thing, right?
[6583.44 --> 6584.26]  Like, what do we...
[6584.26 --> 6584.52]  Look at this.
[6585.46 --> 6587.06]  It's huge.
[6588.62 --> 6590.62]  But they didn't just print the shaft, right?
[6590.66 --> 6590.86]  Nope.
[6590.86 --> 6592.32]  They printed the whole thing.
[6593.34 --> 6593.54]  Yeah.
[6593.60 --> 6593.82]  Okay.
[6594.12 --> 6596.68]  The, the writing confused me for a second.
[6596.68 --> 6598.62]  That's like two pounds of support.
[6599.36 --> 6600.48]  Like, this is...
[6600.48 --> 6603.20]  It looks so heavy.
[6603.20 --> 6609.64]  I mean, surely the infill must be pretty low, but still, what the heck, man?
[6610.54 --> 6611.40]  That is crazy.
[6611.86 --> 6613.52]  And what are you doing with it?
[6614.50 --> 6615.60]  Does he say what he's going to do with it?
[6615.60 --> 6616.72]  Really cool that they custom made a printer.
[6616.92 --> 6617.52]  Body pillow.
[6618.04 --> 6618.94]  Oh my God.
[6619.98 --> 6622.44]  Yeah, that printer is super cool.
[6624.02 --> 6628.16]  Like, you must have a very specific need for...
[6628.16 --> 6629.04]  Oh my God.
[6629.04 --> 6635.40]  I love that it has, like, a print bed from some other printer in here.
[6635.50 --> 6637.64]  And it just doesn't fit at all.
[6637.86 --> 6639.20]  Not nearly large enough.
[6639.68 --> 6640.40]  Like, what do you need to make?
[6640.40 --> 6643.84]  Yeah, so apparently it's a 550 by 550 by 2000.
[6644.50 --> 6646.50]  The print took 20 hours.
[6647.26 --> 6649.34]  The infill percentage was 4%.
[6649.34 --> 6652.04]  And apparently it was like five kilograms of material.
[6656.04 --> 6657.08]  Oh man.
[6657.08 --> 6659.60]  You absolute mad lads.
[6659.68 --> 6661.12]  This is why I love this community.
[6661.68 --> 6662.12]  Amazing.
[6662.26 --> 6663.04]  That's so cool.
[6663.12 --> 6665.04]  Who else would think that this needs to exist?
[6665.96 --> 6670.54]  And who else would go many steps farther and make it exist?
[6670.96 --> 6673.06]  20 hours is insanely short.
[6673.18 --> 6677.82]  Speaking of things that are sort of questionable whether they need to exist or not.
[6678.82 --> 6682.82]  Casio's stress-relieving furry robot is coming to the US.
[6682.82 --> 6689.06]  Pre-orders are now available for the Cuddlybot, which is expected to launch on October 1st for $4.29.
[6689.56 --> 6691.06]  And the source is The Verge.
[6691.36 --> 6693.42]  This is the Moflin.
[6694.08 --> 6698.32]  Are you stressed because of the extreme financial state that the world is currently in?
[6698.54 --> 6700.92]  Spend $429 on us.
[6700.92 --> 6705.44]  We didn't make any notes on this because...
[6705.44 --> 6705.84]  Oh.
[6705.84 --> 6708.54]  There seems to be a Club Play exclusive.
[6709.96 --> 6711.44]  Editors argue about the Casio.
[6711.46 --> 6711.78]  Are you good?
[6712.56 --> 6713.10]  Oh, okay.
[6713.18 --> 6713.78]  We can talk about that.
[6713.82 --> 6714.28]  Yeah, no, sorry.
[6714.36 --> 6717.46]  I just clicked Canada on the Casio site and it said there's no page.
[6717.52 --> 6718.70]  So I guess it's not coming to Canada.
[6718.70 --> 6726.20]  I'm doing this live because I heard of the Moflin, but I didn't really have a ton of details about it.
[6727.20 --> 6728.42]  Oh my God.
[6728.50 --> 6730.12]  Already red flag, red flag.
[6730.24 --> 6734.00]  Let's pick out all the red flags.
[6734.52 --> 6735.50]  Powered by AI.
[6736.08 --> 6737.52]  That's a giant red flag.
[6738.20 --> 6738.46]  Yep.
[6738.82 --> 6739.02]  Yep.
[6739.42 --> 6739.98]  Companion.
[6740.74 --> 6742.80]  That is a giant red flag.
[6743.34 --> 6745.86]  No, a machine is not a companion.
[6745.86 --> 6745.98]  Companion.
[6747.26 --> 6747.78]  Emotions.
[6748.22 --> 6751.54]  Describing it as having emotions, that's a red flag.
[6752.38 --> 6756.18]  Describing it as being like a living creature is a red flag.
[6756.68 --> 6762.02]  So of this sentence, let's go ahead and fire up a notepad here.
[6762.82 --> 6766.36]  Let's look at the percentage of this that is red flag.
[6766.94 --> 6768.40]  So it isn't smart.
[6769.38 --> 6770.66]  It's not a companion.
[6771.94 --> 6773.74]  It is powered by AI.
[6773.74 --> 6775.90]  So let's go ahead and bold that.
[6776.32 --> 6776.60]  What?
[6777.70 --> 6778.98]  Oh my God.
[6779.22 --> 6780.08]  Just bold it.
[6780.14 --> 6781.16]  I don't care right now.
[6782.12 --> 6783.74]  Emotions like a living creature.
[6784.08 --> 6789.68]  So this is about 70% red flag right out of the gate.
[6790.14 --> 6790.86]  Let's keep going.
[6791.40 --> 6792.52]  Oh, it gets worse.
[6793.10 --> 6799.24]  Design to support, reassure, and grow with you through life's everyday moments.
[6799.24 --> 6804.02]  So you're supposed to take it with you everywhere, red flag, and it supports, yeah, reassure,
[6804.14 --> 6805.18]  it will definitely do.
[6805.34 --> 6807.24]  But that doesn't make it not a red flag.
[6808.86 --> 6809.74]  Oh my God.
[6809.88 --> 6814.46]  Yeah, I mean, someone in Flow Punch at the beginning of the show said, by the way, AI told
[6814.46 --> 6816.58]  someone to unalive themselves again.
[6817.28 --> 6820.82]  And at this point, it's happening so often, it's like not even newsworthy anymore.
[6820.82 --> 6824.96]  Your smart companion understands you.
[6825.84 --> 6828.12]  No, it doesn't.
[6829.32 --> 6831.50]  It's just lines of code.
[6831.92 --> 6833.98]  It's a little more complicated than that.
[6834.32 --> 6837.12]  But basically, it's just lines of code.
[6837.20 --> 6839.92]  It doesn't understand anything.
[6841.86 --> 6842.74]  Okay.
[6843.22 --> 6844.38]  Emotional support.
[6844.64 --> 6845.02]  Jesus.
[6845.02 --> 6851.12]  They're actually, they're saying the quiet part out loud where they're just like, yeah,
[6851.36 --> 6856.10]  we want to hook you emotionally on the dopamine hit that our product will give you.
[6856.18 --> 6863.62]  And maybe we won't make it a subscription someday and milk you continuously forever.
[6865.40 --> 6866.00]  Yeah.
[6866.54 --> 6867.10]  Oh my God.
[6867.20 --> 6870.60]  Support you can feel whenever you need it.
[6871.38 --> 6872.48]  Oh my God.
[6872.48 --> 6876.84]  They learn and respond uniquely to their owner's actions.
[6877.76 --> 6879.76]  Becomes part of the family.
[6885.72 --> 6886.74]  Perfectly portable.
[6887.22 --> 6888.58]  I mean, yeah, portable.
[6889.06 --> 6891.58]  A safe and non-judgmental companion.
[6891.68 --> 6891.84]  Okay.
[6891.90 --> 6893.82]  I want to, I want to unpack that a little bit.
[6893.82 --> 6908.88]  There are certain things that like shame and embarrassment and societal and peer pressure can be good for.
[6909.88 --> 6914.72]  You should feel a little bit of judgment about certain things.
[6914.72 --> 6922.02]  I'm not going to get into what they are because I leave that to yours and your community's morality.
[6922.56 --> 6922.76]  Right?
[6923.26 --> 6923.46]  Yeah.
[6923.56 --> 6928.68]  I'm not going to, I'm not going to push my own values on you because I don't know you.
[6929.46 --> 6930.12]  But someone like you.
[6930.12 --> 6934.86]  Literally every community in existence ever has always had something.
[6935.00 --> 6935.66]  Shared values.
[6935.66 --> 6939.84]  Like, hey, maybe, you know, incest is bad.
[6940.34 --> 6940.62]  Right?
[6941.28 --> 6945.98]  That's something that I, hopefully, oh my God, hopefully, we can literally all agree on.
[6949.40 --> 6950.90]  Some communities.
[6954.24 --> 6956.30]  Look, I don't want to talk about the royal family today.
[6959.52 --> 6960.14]  Sorry, Dan.
[6960.34 --> 6961.10]  Which one?
[6961.10 --> 6965.00]  Well, specifically the English.
[6967.54 --> 6968.74]  That was who that was going after.
[6970.00 --> 6971.88]  I don't think punching up counts.
[6972.18 --> 6972.54]  Yeah.
[6972.76 --> 6977.60]  I mean, they have so much more money than me that I think I'm allowed to take shots.
[6979.94 --> 6983.68]  Which, to be clear, is not actually how things necessarily should work.
[6983.68 --> 6988.08]  But they have definitely got so much more incest than me that I think I can, I can take shots.
[6988.22 --> 6990.20]  I was trying to work that in, but good job.
[6991.10 --> 6991.34]  Thanks.
[6991.40 --> 6998.22]  I do think there's a thing that's more universally hated that they may or may not also be allegedly engaged in.
[7000.08 --> 7001.30]  Or what are we talking about?
[7001.46 --> 7002.26]  Relations with the little ones.
[7002.78 --> 7003.42]  Well, okay.
[7003.52 --> 7012.18]  So that, the reason I didn't choose that is that unfortunately, and this is deeply tragic, is not universally agreed on.
[7012.54 --> 7013.44]  There are many parts.
[7013.44 --> 7014.48]  Well, neither is the one that you said.
[7016.68 --> 7017.84]  So, on a...
[7017.84 --> 7019.34]  Welcome to the world.
[7019.84 --> 7020.72]  Roll Tide.
[7020.72 --> 7029.70]  The roll tide was amazing.
[7030.64 --> 7031.30]  Bye, bye, Luke.
[7034.72 --> 7035.78]  We got him, Dan.
[7035.78 --> 7046.54]  Hi, Luke.
[7046.54 --> 7047.18]  How are you?
[7048.14 --> 7050.12]  Is he gonna make it back?
[7050.12 --> 7054.38]  I think we, uh...
[7054.38 --> 7056.28]  I think we ended him.
[7056.70 --> 7057.00]  Cool.
[7057.00 --> 7057.34]  I think it's over.
[7057.82 --> 7058.82]  I can find a topic.
[7058.92 --> 7059.48]  Yeah, new topic.
[7061.16 --> 7062.80]  I don't even know what we were talking about.
[7063.44 --> 7064.94]  Oh, whoa, he came...
[7064.94 --> 7066.40]  That's not where I expected him to come back from.
[7066.66 --> 7067.02]  All right.
[7067.02 --> 7077.06]  Anyway, one of my biggest problems with AI is that they just affirm you.
[7077.06 --> 7078.32]  And, um...
[7078.32 --> 7079.10]  And, um...
[7079.10 --> 7082.32]  Complete non-judgmentality is...
[7083.32 --> 7085.32]  I don't personally believe...
[7085.98 --> 7086.38]  Healthy.
[7086.38 --> 7090.56]  Necessarily, depending on what it's not judging.
[7090.82 --> 7094.30]  There are things that your AI should judge.
[7095.96 --> 7096.72]  Um...
[7096.72 --> 7098.44]  Oh my god.
[7098.52 --> 7099.34]  Wellness benefits.
[7099.44 --> 7102.14]  They're literally selling it as a wellness tool.
[7102.24 --> 7106.54]  Like, you should not be f***ing allowed to do this.
[7107.54 --> 7110.26]  Where are the regulatory bodies that are going,
[7110.26 --> 7115.78]  Hey, AI is an experimental-ass piece of bulls***
[7115.78 --> 7120.10]  And you can't market this as health and wellness.
[7120.40 --> 7121.78]  You actually don't know that.
[7121.84 --> 7122.80]  You haven't proven that.
[7123.10 --> 7128.00]  Like, this is literally why regulations exist for things like food and drugs.
[7128.62 --> 7129.26]  Um...
[7129.82 --> 7132.58]  So that you can't sell people wellness.
[7133.12 --> 7133.56]  Literally.
[7134.14 --> 7135.84]  This is literally snake oil.
[7136.40 --> 7136.68]  Literally.
[7136.68 --> 7136.82]  Really.
[7140.32 --> 7143.16]  To be clear.
[7143.64 --> 7144.02]  AI.
[7144.42 --> 7145.44]  Machine learning.
[7145.86 --> 7146.90]  Generative AI even.
[7147.34 --> 7148.46]  Can be very useful tools.
[7148.80 --> 7153.52]  I'm not inherently saying that I'm anti these tools.
[7153.88 --> 7158.48]  I'm saying that we shouldn't be able to sell them as things that they are not.
[7159.18 --> 7162.98]  And wellness, they are not at this time.
[7162.98 --> 7169.50]  Oh my god.
[7171.80 --> 7174.56]  Anyway, I don't think I can look at this anymore.
[7175.20 --> 7176.54]  What do you want to talk about next?
[7176.70 --> 7177.50]  Yeah, let's do that.
[7178.62 --> 7181.06]  Is there something more positive?
[7181.06 --> 7182.06]  No.
[7186.52 --> 7189.34]  OpenAI announces plans to add aid estimation.
[7190.02 --> 7191.94]  And Twitch adds age verification.
[7192.36 --> 7194.86]  OpenAI says that they're building, in quotes,
[7195.08 --> 7200.28]  building toward a long-term system to understand whether someone is over or under 18
[7200.28 --> 7205.92]  in order to give them age-appropriate policies in prompts and generation.
[7206.70 --> 7210.62]  Twitch has also implemented age verification using the same system as Discord,
[7210.76 --> 7213.04]  requiring users to upload a photo of their face.
[7213.60 --> 7214.56]  Discussion question is,
[7214.62 --> 7219.56]  first chat GPT notifies law enforcement in certain circumstances,
[7219.84 --> 7223.18]  and now age verification, so much for valuing user privacy.
[7223.18 --> 7225.12]  Is all this inevitable?
[7225.48 --> 7226.58]  How else could this go?
[7227.00 --> 7228.68]  It totally is inevitable,
[7228.68 --> 7230.82]  and there is no other way that it could go,
[7231.02 --> 7233.64]  and your only way out is locally running AI.
[7234.10 --> 7235.38]  Wendell has a great video on it.
[7235.52 --> 7237.20]  I'm not going to go bother find it again,
[7237.56 --> 7240.02]  but run your AI locally.
[7240.34 --> 7240.94]  Do it locally.
[7241.10 --> 7242.04]  It's the only way out.
[7242.14 --> 7243.20]  The only path forward.
[7243.74 --> 7244.28]  Find a way.
[7245.98 --> 7246.42]  Nice.
[7246.42 --> 7250.06]  I looked at a bracket instead of the camera.
[7250.16 --> 7250.40]  There we go.
[7250.44 --> 7250.72]  Nice.
[7253.36 --> 7253.98]  All right.
[7254.04 --> 7255.74]  I don't want to talk about that for any longer either.
[7256.08 --> 7257.20]  Can we find some good news?
[7257.56 --> 7258.26]  Do you have any good news?
[7258.38 --> 7258.60]  Hey!
[7259.04 --> 7263.90]  There's a date set for a UK Parliament debate on the Stop Killing Games petition.
[7264.54 --> 7266.08]  The debate was confirmed in July,
[7266.08 --> 7268.08]  but now has a date set of November 3rd.
[7270.26 --> 7273.98]  We have a link to format of petitions debate if you're interested.
[7274.22 --> 7275.48]  Can't say I'm that interested.
[7275.48 --> 7277.92]  But there are some potential outcomes.
[7278.20 --> 7281.10]  So petitions debates can't directly change the law
[7281.10 --> 7283.40]  or result in a vote to implement the request of the petition,
[7283.62 --> 7286.96]  but they can help raise awareness of the issue among members of Parliament
[7286.96 --> 7289.68]  and the wider public and put pressure on the government.
[7289.86 --> 7292.74]  So it seems like the best outcome we can realistically hope for
[7292.74 --> 7296.64]  is spreading awareness so that MPs realize that this is a cause
[7296.64 --> 7298.46]  that their constituents care about.
[7298.58 --> 7302.18]  So this is the whole thing where if you release a game and someone pays for it,
[7302.18 --> 7305.18]  you can't just like turn it off and decide that,
[7305.84 --> 7306.62]  well, it's off now.
[7306.72 --> 7307.60]  Sorry you paid for it.
[7307.72 --> 7308.02]  Good luck.
[7308.08 --> 7308.44]  Have fun.
[7308.44 --> 7312.70]  And hopefully we can continue to gain momentum here
[7312.70 --> 7317.50]  and eventually they will not be able to do that anymore.
[7317.66 --> 7317.94]  Cool.
[7318.18 --> 7318.64]  Good chat.
[7319.98 --> 7321.14]  What else we got here?
[7321.38 --> 7322.96]  Do you want to do our last main topic?
[7324.00 --> 7326.00]  Oh, I forgot that was even up there.
[7326.06 --> 7326.28]  Yeah.
[7326.50 --> 7327.18]  You want to talk about it?
[7327.18 --> 7327.98]  You want to talk through that one?
[7328.06 --> 7328.20]  Sure.
[7328.20 --> 7329.82]  This is pretty wild.
[7331.44 --> 7335.94]  Asus gaming laptops are broken and apparently have been since 2021.
[7336.72 --> 7344.14]  Mohamed Matala, aka Zefkek on GitHub,
[7344.14 --> 7351.68]  has posted an extensive account of his investigation into stuttering,
[7351.92 --> 7356.10]  freezing and other performance hiccups that have plagued high-end Asus laptops
[7356.10 --> 7357.12]  since 2021.
[7357.62 --> 7361.90]  For years, users have reported stuttering during basic tasks like YouTube playback,
[7362.28 --> 7364.56]  audio crackles and pops on Discord calls,
[7364.74 --> 7368.30]  and the mouse cursor freezing for just long enough to be infuriating.
[7368.60 --> 7372.76]  The problems impact millions of Asus Strix, Scar and Zephyrus laptops,
[7372.76 --> 7378.18]  which typically include top-tier Intel CPUs, RTX 30 or 40 series GPUs,
[7378.48 --> 7379.38]  and plenty of RAM.
[7379.72 --> 7382.52]  Users typically report trying everything to fix their systems,
[7382.52 --> 7384.34]  with many even installing Linux,
[7384.56 --> 7387.86]  only to find the problems persist regardless of the operating system.
[7387.96 --> 7388.62]  Which is pretty wild.
[7388.64 --> 7392.00]  Which reminds me a lot of the Lenovo laptop I'm currently running,
[7392.08 --> 7396.10]  where the system just, the main screen just stops working randomly,
[7396.20 --> 7397.44]  and I have to close it and open it again.
[7397.50 --> 7398.04]  It's fantastic.
[7400.04 --> 7402.02]  Using freely available tools,
[7402.36 --> 7405.86]  Zefkek was able to monitor process latencies under Windows
[7405.86 --> 7407.74]  on multiple impacted systems,
[7408.06 --> 7411.06]  finding enough evidence to implicate high DPC,
[7411.40 --> 7412.80]  or deferred procedure call,
[7413.12 --> 7416.22]  latency originating with ACPI.Sys.
[7416.70 --> 7419.80]  But that doesn't mean it's a Windows problem.
[7420.14 --> 7422.70]  ACPI.Sys isn't a typical driver.
[7422.92 --> 7426.76]  It's effectively an interpreter for the ACPI machine language,
[7427.30 --> 7430.44]  the code provided by the laptop's firmware.
[7430.44 --> 7433.02]  If ACPI.Sys is slow,
[7433.34 --> 7437.06]  it's because the firmware is passing inefficient or flawed code to execute.
[7437.60 --> 7438.22]  Not good.
[7438.52 --> 7439.14]  Digging further,
[7439.28 --> 7442.58]  Zefkek discovered that the latency spikes aren't random events.
[7442.70 --> 7446.26]  They recur reliably every 30 to 60 seconds.
[7446.58 --> 7450.00]  While random interruptions might point to thermal throttling,
[7450.26 --> 7452.82]  a repeating pattern shows that it's a systemic issue,
[7452.94 --> 7455.94]  perhaps a timer or a scheduled event in the system logic.
[7456.44 --> 7457.98]  Reviewing raw event data,
[7457.98 --> 7460.92]  and it wouldn't be something like Armory Crate,
[7461.22 --> 7463.74]  because it still happened when they installed Linux.
[7463.90 --> 7464.46]  Okay, interesting.
[7464.70 --> 7466.04]  Because my first assumption was like,
[7466.10 --> 7468.12]  maybe this is something going on with Armory Crate.
[7470.18 --> 7474.16]  Reviewing raw event data uncovered a high priority interrupt handler,
[7474.88 --> 7476.68]  GPE-LO2,
[7477.20 --> 7480.26]  consistently taking more than 13 milliseconds to execute,
[7480.50 --> 7482.92]  which, as far as high priority interrupts go,
[7483.38 --> 7484.64]  is an extremely long time.
[7484.74 --> 7485.58]  It might as well be forever.
[7485.58 --> 7488.60]  And then it repeats itself roughly every 30 seconds.
[7489.06 --> 7489.36]  Oh, wow.
[7489.36 --> 7495.40]  Event data also revealed that the system repeatedly tries to turn the discrete GPU on and off,
[7495.68 --> 7497.52]  even when it's supposed to be permanently active.
[7497.72 --> 7498.50]  That's rough.
[7498.90 --> 7500.70]  Every time that interrupt is fired,
[7500.90 --> 7502.02]  the same sequence occurs.
[7502.14 --> 7503.74]  The handler checks battery status.
[7504.16 --> 7506.44]  The firmware tries to change the GPU's power state.
[7506.44 --> 7508.96]  The system runs normally for 30, 60 seconds,
[7509.10 --> 7510.64]  and then rinse and repeat.
[7511.14 --> 7515.30]  Zefkek extracted and decompiled the ACPI.
[7515.30 --> 7516.26]  I love that they created this much.
[7516.26 --> 7516.86]  What a mad lad.
[7516.86 --> 7518.10]  This is so awesome.
[7518.96 --> 7524.16]  Zefkek extracted and decompiled the ACPI tables provided by the BIOS to the operating system,
[7524.48 --> 7526.04]  finding code, he says,
[7526.22 --> 7530.52]  violated several fundamental principles of firmware and kernel programming.
[7530.52 --> 7531.92]  Oof.
[7532.30 --> 7536.98]  There are multiple calls to sleep inside the interrupter handler code.
[7537.52 --> 7540.62]  There's a link here of disassembled code,
[7540.68 --> 7543.52]  and the comments are from the Zefkek.
[7543.94 --> 7548.32]  The sleep function completely halts the execution of the CPU core it is running on,
[7548.54 --> 7551.26]  which then can't process other interrupts
[7551.26 --> 7555.76]  and won't allow the kernel to schedule other threads or to update system timers.
[7555.76 --> 7557.92]  And it gets worse.
[7558.28 --> 7563.46]  The entire loop is effectively a poorly designed task scheduler inside the interrupt handler,
[7563.46 --> 7567.12]  which can hold a CPU core hostage for seconds at a time,
[7567.20 --> 7570.90]  which when you're trying to use the computer is going to feel horrible.
[7572.02 --> 7574.22]  When the event queue is finally empty,
[7574.40 --> 7576.66]  the code generates a new artificial event,
[7576.94 --> 7579.32]  guaranteeing that another interrupt will fire shortly,
[7579.68 --> 7584.66]  creating the pattern of ACPI spikes observed in the initial investigation
[7584.66 --> 7589.28]  and creating a pattern of muddy-feeling computer usage.
[7590.14 --> 7592.72]  This is compounded by a number of other issues,
[7592.96 --> 7595.14]  including failing to check which GPU is active
[7595.14 --> 7597.56]  before sending potentially damaging commands to it,
[7597.90 --> 7600.62]  calling time-intensive power and battery polling functions
[7600.62 --> 7602.94]  in the middle of already stalled interrupt handlers,
[7603.28 --> 7607.22]  and implementing a second separate power management system in the firmware
[7607.22 --> 7611.28]  that features many of the same problems.
[7611.28 --> 7615.18]  It is a long technical report, if this wasn't already,
[7615.18 --> 7618.32]  and there's so much more that we just glossed over.
[7618.42 --> 7619.70]  So go check it out for yourself.
[7620.12 --> 7622.34]  Dan, do you want to throw links in the video description,
[7622.44 --> 7624.46]  or in the chats on the various platforms?
[7624.58 --> 7624.98]  Thank you.
[7626.90 --> 7629.34]  And it says that the conclusion makes an excellent TLDR.
[7629.70 --> 7634.10]  ASUS has put out a statement on X or Twitter or whatever it's called,
[7634.20 --> 7636.96]  stating that they've seen recent reports
[7636.96 --> 7641.52]  and are actively investigating, which, damn.
[7641.96 --> 7643.18]  The discussion question is,
[7643.32 --> 7644.38]  what the hell, ASUS?
[7644.48 --> 7645.32]  Five years?
[7646.54 --> 7647.02]  Yoof.
[7647.54 --> 7649.26]  And then, has chat run into this?
[7649.36 --> 7651.22]  How did ASUS handle your support requests,
[7651.38 --> 7653.24]  and what do they need to do to make this right?
[7653.32 --> 7654.16]  That's tough.
[7654.94 --> 7656.94]  I mean, they need to fix it first.
[7657.58 --> 7657.88]  Yeah.
[7658.08 --> 7660.58]  Regardless of whether the system is still under warranty,
[7660.94 --> 7663.56]  they need to, or being actively supported,
[7663.68 --> 7665.34]  they need to issue a firmware fix for this.
[7665.34 --> 7666.42]  Absolutely.
[7668.50 --> 7670.58]  But other than that...
[7670.58 --> 7674.18]  Other than that, I doubt they will do anything else.
[7674.62 --> 7677.00]  But, I mean, honestly,
[7678.48 --> 7679.26]  oh, man.
[7679.90 --> 7681.30]  They need to do at least that.
[7681.42 --> 7684.60]  They need firmware updates for all of these laptops
[7684.60 --> 7686.16]  that fix the ACPI issues.
[7686.88 --> 7688.72]  And that is going to be, I mean,
[7688.80 --> 7691.10]  if it's pretty much every high-performance laptop
[7691.10 --> 7693.10]  for five years,
[7693.10 --> 7696.80]  this is going to be a gargantuan task
[7696.80 --> 7701.54]  to go in and fix all the various...
[7701.54 --> 7703.46]  Because I'm sure that they're not running
[7703.46 --> 7705.26]  the exact same code on a laptop
[7705.26 --> 7706.50]  from four years ago as today.
[7706.60 --> 7707.28]  So whatever this is,
[7707.30 --> 7709.42]  it's probably persisted through multiple changes.
[7709.58 --> 7710.46]  So they need to go,
[7710.52 --> 7712.70]  and they need to fix all different permutations of this.
[7714.76 --> 7715.66]  What a mess.
[7715.66 --> 7719.94]  It could be pretty similar.
[7721.34 --> 7723.44]  I just wonder why...
[7723.44 --> 7728.88]  Why I would never have noticed it.
[7729.44 --> 7731.44]  Because I have daily driven a...
[7732.86 --> 7734.44]  Like, I really like my...
[7735.52 --> 7737.12]  Shoot, I forget what it's called right now,
[7737.16 --> 7739.92]  but the convertible one with the XG Mobile connector.
[7740.06 --> 7740.16]  Flow X-15.
[7740.16 --> 7742.50]  Is that a Strix, Scar, or Zephyrus?
[7743.02 --> 7744.50]  No, it's a Flow.
[7745.48 --> 7750.94]  This said the problems impact millions
[7750.94 --> 7753.52]  of Strix, Scar, or Zephyrus laptops.
[7754.22 --> 7755.48]  Oh, wait, no, it is a Zephyrus then.
[7755.60 --> 7756.96]  Zephyrus G13.
[7757.16 --> 7757.64]  Is it?
[7757.74 --> 7758.66]  Oh, no, hold on.
[7758.70 --> 7759.12]  What is it?
[7760.28 --> 7760.92]  Flow X...
[7760.92 --> 7762.24]  I think you might be...
[7762.24 --> 7763.72]  I think you might be on a Zephyrus.
[7763.80 --> 7764.88]  I think you might actually have one.
[7765.40 --> 7767.46]  The ROG Flow X-13.
[7768.14 --> 7769.64]  I don't think it's a Zephyrus.
[7769.64 --> 7770.42]  Just a Flow.
[7770.42 --> 7772.20]  I also had a Flow.
[7773.66 --> 7775.32]  So I wouldn't have noticed it either.
[7775.76 --> 7777.36]  Apparently, the more cores you have,
[7777.42 --> 7779.14]  the less likely you are to notice it.
[7779.92 --> 7781.30]  And that was an 8-core laptop,
[7781.52 --> 7782.84]  so maybe that made a difference.
[7783.68 --> 7784.24]  Maybe.
[7784.98 --> 7785.50]  Unreal.
[7787.14 --> 7788.20]  In other news,
[7788.76 --> 7791.90]  China has accused NVIDIA of violating antitrust laws
[7791.90 --> 7793.88]  and has banned Chinese companies
[7793.88 --> 7795.50]  from buying their GPUs.
[7797.40 --> 7797.76]  Ooh.
[7797.76 --> 7798.64]  Wow.
[7798.96 --> 7799.24]  Yeah.
[7799.46 --> 7801.10]  China really cares a lot
[7801.10 --> 7803.72]  about fair competition in the market.
[7804.54 --> 7805.54]  So...
[7805.54 --> 7809.92]  Dude, man, it's wild watching...
[7809.92 --> 7812.38]  Actually, realistically,
[7812.56 --> 7813.96]  any of the big players these days
[7813.96 --> 7816.56]  complain about international trade
[7816.56 --> 7818.26]  and international law and order.
[7819.62 --> 7820.14]  It's just...
[7820.14 --> 7821.38]  They're so brazenly,
[7821.54 --> 7824.16]  transparently only self-interested
[7824.16 --> 7826.18]  and hypocritical.
[7826.30 --> 7826.72]  But anyway,
[7827.22 --> 7828.44]  China accuses NVIDIA
[7828.44 --> 7829.82]  violating antitrust laws.
[7830.28 --> 7831.32]  What will this mean?
[7831.48 --> 7832.44]  I don't know.
[7833.08 --> 7833.60]  Realistically,
[7833.96 --> 7836.68]  no amount of banning NVIDIA GPUs
[7836.68 --> 7837.46]  by anyone
[7837.46 --> 7838.78]  to China
[7838.78 --> 7839.88]  has seems to have made
[7839.88 --> 7840.94]  a lick of difference
[7840.94 --> 7841.94]  in terms of
[7841.94 --> 7844.54]  Chinese firms acquiring NVIDIA GPUs.
[7844.58 --> 7845.72]  So I fully expect this
[7845.72 --> 7847.26]  to not change that much,
[7847.32 --> 7848.14]  but we'll see how it goes.
[7848.68 --> 7849.62]  And now I think it is time...
[7849.62 --> 7852.66]  I like how the subtitle says
[7852.66 --> 7853.72]  this may also be another
[7853.72 --> 7854.52]  indirect tactic
[7854.52 --> 7856.08]  in the ongoing trade negotiations.
[7856.30 --> 7856.54]  It's like,
[7856.64 --> 7857.34]  hmm, yes,
[7858.28 --> 7859.06]  it may.
[7859.10 --> 7859.52]  It may.
[7859.54 --> 7860.28]  For sure.
[7860.66 --> 7861.88]  The TikTok sale deadline
[7861.88 --> 7863.14]  has been extended again,
[7863.28 --> 7863.66]  apparently.
[7864.04 --> 7864.98]  I actually don't feel like
[7864.98 --> 7865.70]  talking about that either.
[7865.78 --> 7866.58]  So let's move on
[7866.58 --> 7868.44]  to when after dark,
[7868.54 --> 7868.86]  shall we?
[7868.90 --> 7869.80]  Let's do some merge messages.
[7870.68 --> 7870.96]  Yeah.
[7872.08 --> 7872.80]  Sure thing.
[7872.88 --> 7873.94]  Yeah, there's quite a few today.
[7874.06 --> 7875.84]  It seems like people liked the sale.
[7876.08 --> 7877.70]  Yeah, I was just checking the...
[7877.70 --> 7879.16]  I was checking the store sales,
[7879.16 --> 7880.58]  and I forgot to do
[7880.58 --> 7881.70]  my usual reminder
[7881.70 --> 7882.68]  when we have a sale
[7882.68 --> 7883.88]  with a bunch of loss leaders
[7883.88 --> 7884.46]  to be like,
[7884.60 --> 7886.38]  hey, so we're losing money
[7886.38 --> 7887.28]  on all that stuff.
[7887.34 --> 7888.46]  Could you please add
[7888.46 --> 7889.58]  something else to your order?
[7889.94 --> 7890.62]  So no one did.
[7894.46 --> 7895.24]  So that's cool.
[7895.24 --> 7896.44]  Good to know that call-out works.
[7896.64 --> 7897.16]  It does.
[7897.24 --> 7897.54]  It does.
[7897.66 --> 7898.30]  People are actually
[7898.30 --> 7899.22]  usually pretty chill.
[7899.30 --> 7899.52]  They're like,
[7899.56 --> 7900.56]  oh yeah, I'm getting a shirt
[7900.56 --> 7901.16]  for $6.
[7901.52 --> 7902.26]  I should probably,
[7902.46 --> 7903.14]  you know,
[7903.40 --> 7904.74]  order a notebook
[7904.74 --> 7905.68]  or something else
[7905.68 --> 7906.46]  that has some margin.
[7906.80 --> 7908.54]  That $7 button down
[7908.54 --> 7909.38]  was...
[7909.38 --> 7912.34]  That was definitely a deal.
[7913.08 --> 7915.00]  That was a deal of all time.
[7915.26 --> 7915.52]  Yeah.
[7915.96 --> 7916.98]  Appreciate you guys
[7916.98 --> 7918.12]  anyway.
[7918.96 --> 7920.30]  So yeah,
[7920.46 --> 7922.66]  we defragged our warehouse,
[7922.92 --> 7923.72]  and that's cool.
[7924.34 --> 7925.24]  But that is
[7925.24 --> 7927.30]  all we accomplished today.
[7928.42 --> 7929.82]  I guess we also get
[7929.82 --> 7931.82]  some wonderful conversation starters
[7931.82 --> 7933.28]  in the form of these merch messages.
[7933.84 --> 7934.60]  Hit me, Luke.
[7935.52 --> 7935.92]  Dan,
[7936.04 --> 7936.68]  whatever your name is.
[7936.76 --> 7937.88]  Well, this one is for Luke.
[7937.98 --> 7939.58]  I can see how you read that
[7939.58 --> 7941.86]  with brain split.
[7942.32 --> 7943.06]  Question for Luke.
[7943.20 --> 7945.52]  How is Learning Godot going?
[7945.80 --> 7946.54]  Thank you.
[7946.92 --> 7947.16]  Oh,
[7947.90 --> 7950.10]  I haven't touched that in a while.
[7950.36 --> 7951.22]  It's a good question.
[7951.30 --> 7952.38]  I've wanted to get back to it.
[7952.50 --> 7953.32]  I've been...
[7953.32 --> 7957.66]  I don't know if I've touched it
[7957.66 --> 7960.02]  since joining labs.
[7960.02 --> 7960.22]  Nice.
[7962.94 --> 7963.50]  Like it all.
[7963.58 --> 7964.20]  It's been pretty busy.
[7965.12 --> 7965.44]  Yeah.
[7966.86 --> 7968.02]  I will get back to it.
[7968.08 --> 7968.68]  It was fun.
[7968.80 --> 7969.72]  I was having a good time.
[7970.06 --> 7970.76]  I got...
[7970.76 --> 7972.20]  So my plan at the time
[7972.20 --> 7973.28]  was to make something
[7973.28 --> 7974.16]  that I would never be able
[7974.16 --> 7974.66]  to release.
[7974.94 --> 7975.70]  I don't know if I ended up
[7975.70 --> 7976.16]  talking about this
[7976.16 --> 7976.80]  on the show at all.
[7978.28 --> 7979.50]  Or I wanted to...
[7979.50 --> 7979.90]  I just...
[7979.90 --> 7980.82]  I didn't want to think
[7980.82 --> 7981.58]  about the inspiration
[7981.58 --> 7982.00]  of the thing
[7982.00 --> 7982.64]  that I wanted to make.
[7982.74 --> 7983.64]  I just wanted to make
[7983.64 --> 7985.00]  like a self-tech demo.
[7985.46 --> 7986.40]  Like, what can I do?
[7986.46 --> 7987.08]  I want to learn.
[7987.16 --> 7987.74]  I want to get used
[7987.74 --> 7988.60]  to working in this system.
[7988.68 --> 7989.16]  What can I do?
[7989.54 --> 7990.60]  So for some reason
[7990.60 --> 7991.30]  it came to mind
[7991.30 --> 7993.32]  that I wanted to recreate
[7993.32 --> 7995.24]  Kelithin,
[7995.44 --> 7996.34]  which is like the elf
[7996.34 --> 7997.20]  starting area
[7997.20 --> 7998.34]  from EverQuest
[7998.34 --> 7999.06]  that I played
[7999.06 --> 7999.74]  when I was like
[7999.74 --> 8001.92]  10 or something.
[8003.10 --> 8004.34]  But I wanted to make it
[8004.34 --> 8005.26]  in 2D
[8005.26 --> 8008.06]  and imperfectly.
[8008.14 --> 8008.76]  But it gave me
[8008.76 --> 8009.58]  a framework for like,
[8009.64 --> 8009.86]  okay,
[8010.16 --> 8011.32]  there are these types
[8011.32 --> 8011.84]  of enemies.
[8012.06 --> 8013.84]  There is this friendly area
[8013.84 --> 8014.40]  where you can have
[8014.40 --> 8015.28]  like shops and stuff.
[8015.40 --> 8016.22]  And then there's this
[8016.22 --> 8017.50]  more advanced area
[8017.50 --> 8018.50]  with orcs later on
[8018.50 --> 8018.96]  that you have to go
[8018.96 --> 8019.46]  into a cave.
[8019.60 --> 8020.36]  It gave me like,
[8020.44 --> 8020.62]  okay,
[8020.86 --> 8021.80]  I have a perfect picture
[8021.80 --> 8022.64]  of exactly what I need
[8022.64 --> 8022.98]  to make.
[8023.26 --> 8023.88]  I know the leveling,
[8024.08 --> 8024.36]  scaling,
[8024.52 --> 8025.36]  I know the difficulty scaling,
[8025.48 --> 8025.92]  I know the loot,
[8026.00 --> 8026.30]  everything,
[8026.44 --> 8026.60]  boom,
[8026.68 --> 8026.86]  done.
[8027.02 --> 8027.58]  So I didn't have to
[8027.58 --> 8028.36]  think about that anymore.
[8028.52 --> 8029.32]  I just had to make it.
[8030.40 --> 8031.64]  And that felt like a good
[8031.64 --> 8031.92]  like,
[8032.02 --> 8032.24]  okay,
[8032.28 --> 8032.92]  I can actually start
[8032.92 --> 8034.18]  building things immediately
[8034.18 --> 8035.14]  instead of like
[8035.14 --> 8035.82]  humming and hawing
[8035.82 --> 8036.88]  for years
[8036.88 --> 8038.08]  over what exact game
[8038.08 --> 8038.62]  I want to make.
[8038.84 --> 8039.14]  It's like,
[8039.18 --> 8039.26]  no,
[8039.28 --> 8040.06]  I'm just going to do something.
[8040.42 --> 8040.88]  And I got
[8040.88 --> 8043.48]  decently progressed
[8043.48 --> 8043.94]  into that.
[8044.06 --> 8045.06]  I had different zones.
[8045.06 --> 8047.06]  So unlike in Everquest
[8047.06 --> 8047.74]  where you just like
[8047.74 --> 8048.28]  walk,
[8048.70 --> 8049.34]  you could like
[8049.34 --> 8050.78]  zone into
[8050.78 --> 8053.92]  the town of Kelothan.
[8054.34 --> 8054.98]  So you didn't go up
[8054.98 --> 8055.42]  the elevator
[8055.42 --> 8056.30]  into the trees anymore.
[8056.40 --> 8057.14]  You just walked in
[8057.14 --> 8058.02]  and then you could
[8058.02 --> 8058.90]  walk out into like
[8058.90 --> 8059.38]  the forest
[8059.38 --> 8060.32]  and there was the skeletons
[8060.32 --> 8060.98]  and the bees
[8060.98 --> 8061.46]  and whatever.
[8061.88 --> 8062.30]  And then you could
[8062.30 --> 8063.04]  walk out further
[8063.04 --> 8064.40]  and then zone out
[8064.40 --> 8066.52]  into where the orcs were
[8066.52 --> 8068.90]  and you could kill stuff
[8068.90 --> 8069.50]  and loot things
[8069.50 --> 8070.56]  and that all kind of
[8070.56 --> 8071.38]  sort of worked,
[8071.60 --> 8072.14]  which was neat.
[8072.14 --> 8074.66]  And then I want to
[8074.66 --> 8075.48]  keep going from there.
[8075.76 --> 8076.84]  So we'll see.
[8077.10 --> 8078.58]  But I'm going to need
[8078.58 --> 8079.08]  a little bit more
[8079.08 --> 8079.60]  free time.
[8079.80 --> 8081.58]  So definitely not
[8081.58 --> 8082.26]  this month
[8082.26 --> 8083.58]  because this month
[8083.58 --> 8084.46]  has been the busiest
[8084.46 --> 8084.86]  ever.
[8085.50 --> 8087.52]  And probably when
[8087.52 --> 8088.56]  my house is not
[8088.56 --> 8090.50]  effectively non-functional.
[8090.62 --> 8091.56]  So those two things
[8091.56 --> 8092.48]  will need to be resolved
[8092.48 --> 8093.40]  and then we'll get
[8093.40 --> 8093.88]  moving again.
[8095.42 --> 8095.94]  Next,
[8096.36 --> 8097.20]  Vimeo sold to
[8097.20 --> 8098.22]  Bending Spoons,
[8098.46 --> 8099.22]  company that bought
[8099.22 --> 8099.96]  WeTransfer,
[8100.30 --> 8101.54]  changed the terms of service
[8101.54 --> 8102.74]  to include AI training.
[8103.42 --> 8104.44]  Where can creatives
[8104.44 --> 8105.44]  safely host their
[8105.44 --> 8106.56]  short films and reels
[8106.56 --> 8107.58]  without breaking bank?
[8107.86 --> 8109.12]  On Floatplane for price?
[8112.36 --> 8114.86]  I hate that this is the answer,
[8115.02 --> 8115.90]  but that is such a
[8115.90 --> 8116.74]  niche use case
[8116.74 --> 8117.50]  that most people
[8117.50 --> 8118.52]  aren't even going to think of,
[8118.58 --> 8119.34]  much less be willing
[8119.34 --> 8120.00]  to pay for,
[8120.54 --> 8123.64]  that I don't even know
[8123.64 --> 8124.52]  if it would be worth it
[8124.52 --> 8125.48]  for us to develop
[8125.48 --> 8126.26]  like a paid
[8126.26 --> 8129.72]  video hosting tier.
[8129.72 --> 8130.24]  I mean,
[8130.50 --> 8130.74]  Luke,
[8130.84 --> 8132.42]  am I totally off base here?
[8132.46 --> 8133.74]  Am I completely missing this?
[8134.54 --> 8135.74]  It sounds like Vimeo.
[8136.22 --> 8137.46]  But Vimeo sold
[8137.46 --> 8138.72]  to Bending Spoons.
[8138.90 --> 8139.20]  Oh.
[8139.34 --> 8140.38]  And they changed the TOS
[8140.38 --> 8141.40]  to include AI training.
[8141.74 --> 8142.98]  That's the whole question.
[8143.92 --> 8146.50]  Luke phased out of
[8146.50 --> 8147.34]  the car.
[8147.34 --> 8147.72]  I did.
[8147.94 --> 8149.44]  At the beginning of the thing.
[8149.54 --> 8149.98]  I thought it was
[8149.98 --> 8150.94]  specifically for Linus.
[8151.10 --> 8151.26]  I was,
[8151.38 --> 8151.54]  yeah,
[8151.64 --> 8153.00]  I tuned back in later on.
[8153.10 --> 8153.20]  But,
[8153.20 --> 8157.02]  I don't,
[8157.08 --> 8158.06]  I don't think it makes
[8158.06 --> 8159.20]  a ton of sense for us.
[8159.44 --> 8159.58]  Dude,
[8159.68 --> 8160.48]  I just heard back
[8160.48 --> 8161.22]  from the tape to tape
[8161.22 --> 8161.74]  dev team
[8161.74 --> 8163.12]  just right now.
[8163.38 --> 8164.64]  The update I just pushed
[8164.64 --> 8165.26]  should help fix
[8165.26 --> 8166.20]  the defenseman behavior.
[8166.78 --> 8167.80]  These guys are so awesome.
[8168.92 --> 8169.36]  That's,
[8169.36 --> 8170.34]  that's pretty legit.
[8172.34 --> 8172.86]  I,
[8173.24 --> 8175.40]  we could do it,
[8175.60 --> 8177.00]  but there's another path
[8177.00 --> 8178.14]  that we're currently following
[8178.14 --> 8179.30]  that I think,
[8179.64 --> 8179.76]  because,
[8179.86 --> 8180.10]  okay,
[8180.10 --> 8181.32]  so we have this problem
[8181.32 --> 8181.76]  where like,
[8181.96 --> 8183.04]  there was one specific
[8183.04 --> 8183.70]  point in time
[8183.70 --> 8184.42]  in the history
[8184.42 --> 8185.54]  of Flowplane
[8185.54 --> 8187.38]  where we had a bunch
[8187.38 --> 8188.06]  of creators
[8188.06 --> 8189.66]  asking for features
[8189.66 --> 8190.56]  and they were like,
[8190.62 --> 8190.70]  yeah,
[8190.72 --> 8191.32]  if you supported
[8191.32 --> 8192.70]  X or Y feature,
[8192.86 --> 8194.08]  I would join the platform.
[8194.74 --> 8195.26]  Yeah.
[8195.38 --> 8196.00]  And we did
[8196.00 --> 8197.58]  a number of things
[8197.58 --> 8200.60]  in order to support
[8200.60 --> 8201.64]  said features,
[8202.24 --> 8203.34]  some of which
[8203.34 --> 8205.04]  were not light lifts.
[8205.22 --> 8205.92]  I'm talking like
[8205.92 --> 8207.20]  very extensive work,
[8207.30 --> 8208.46]  very extensive changes.
[8208.46 --> 8211.18]  and I'm fairly certain,
[8211.48 --> 8213.12]  genuinely zero of them
[8213.12 --> 8214.48]  that said,
[8214.58 --> 8214.68]  hey,
[8214.70 --> 8215.62]  if you support this thing,
[8215.64 --> 8216.10]  I'll join,
[8216.56 --> 8218.06]  ever did join.
[8218.18 --> 8218.80]  It's been a pattern
[8218.80 --> 8220.94]  for us that creators
[8220.94 --> 8222.72]  and we're not going to pretend
[8222.72 --> 8224.64]  that we're perfect either
[8224.64 --> 8226.02]  because I think both of us
[8226.02 --> 8227.44]  struggle in this area.
[8227.56 --> 8227.74]  Oh yeah.
[8227.84 --> 8228.94]  Creators have a tendency
[8228.94 --> 8230.80]  to be very busy,
[8231.72 --> 8231.98]  very,
[8232.44 --> 8233.42]  spread very thin,
[8233.42 --> 8235.80]  very,
[8236.34 --> 8237.92]  in some cases,
[8238.16 --> 8239.12]  like hyper-focused
[8239.12 --> 8240.70]  on other things
[8240.70 --> 8242.56]  and what that boils down to
[8242.56 --> 8243.36]  is creators
[8243.36 --> 8244.74]  and I hate to generalize
[8244.74 --> 8245.52]  but I will
[8245.52 --> 8246.76]  because I'm one of them
[8246.76 --> 8248.16]  so I'm allowed to do it,
[8248.22 --> 8248.56]  I think.
[8248.72 --> 8249.76]  I think that's how this works.
[8250.22 --> 8251.10]  Creators tend to be
[8251.10 --> 8252.80]  pretty f***ing flaky.
[8253.62 --> 8254.14]  Oh yeah.
[8254.22 --> 8254.36]  There,
[8254.42 --> 8254.82]  I said it.
[8255.96 --> 8256.36]  Yeah,
[8256.48 --> 8257.70]  so like one of the ways
[8257.70 --> 8258.06]  that we've,
[8258.18 --> 8258.86]  so we have,
[8259.06 --> 8260.28]  we have three different polls
[8260.28 --> 8261.18]  on our development team,
[8261.20 --> 8261.32]  right?
[8261.32 --> 8262.60]  We have the users,
[8263.18 --> 8264.06]  we have the creators,
[8264.56 --> 8265.38]  and then we have-
[8265.38 --> 8265.96]  P-U-L-L-S,
[8266.38 --> 8267.22]  P-U-L-L-S,
[8267.58 --> 8268.42]  just so you guys are clear.
[8268.48 --> 8269.92]  It sounded like P-O-L-L-S
[8269.92 --> 8271.16]  or P-O-L-E-S.
[8271.16 --> 8271.34]  Oh no, sorry,
[8271.40 --> 8271.70]  yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8271.94 --> 8273.30]  I guess there's kind of like four.
[8273.62 --> 8274.66]  There's the users,
[8274.96 --> 8275.84]  there's the creators,
[8276.34 --> 8278.00]  there's the like business
[8278.00 --> 8279.48]  and then there's the developers
[8279.48 --> 8281.90]  because we have to make some stuff
[8281.90 --> 8283.64]  that is for the developers,
[8283.74 --> 8283.86]  right?
[8283.86 --> 8284.74]  You have to do work
[8284.74 --> 8286.86]  that is tuned towards
[8286.86 --> 8288.12]  making our lives
[8288.12 --> 8289.10]  not completely horrible
[8289.10 --> 8291.44]  because if you never do that,
[8292.06 --> 8292.64]  then your lives are horrible.
[8292.64 --> 8293.26]  You end up in a situation
[8293.26 --> 8294.18]  where you,
[8294.44 --> 8294.62]  well,
[8294.74 --> 8295.56]  not only that,
[8295.60 --> 8296.44]  but you end up in a situation
[8296.44 --> 8297.44]  where you can't make anything
[8297.44 --> 8298.50]  because you just have
[8298.50 --> 8299.44]  so much tech debt
[8299.44 --> 8300.40]  that so much of your time
[8300.40 --> 8302.60]  is wasted maintaining junk
[8302.60 --> 8304.64]  and you just can't,
[8304.96 --> 8307.18]  you end up cycling forever
[8307.18 --> 8308.46]  without actually producing anything.
[8308.72 --> 8310.64]  So you have to do some dev tasks,
[8311.04 --> 8313.46]  you have to do some creator tasks,
[8313.74 --> 8315.18]  you have to do some user tasks,
[8315.18 --> 8317.04]  and you have to do some business tasks.
[8317.04 --> 8318.80]  And if you don't do a little bit of everything,
[8319.16 --> 8320.32]  someone will get pissed off.
[8321.00 --> 8322.78]  And we've kind of shifted
[8322.78 --> 8325.20]  the creator tasks mostly,
[8325.46 --> 8326.10]  not entirely,
[8326.26 --> 8328.48]  but mostly away from prospective creators
[8328.48 --> 8330.22]  to doing development
[8330.22 --> 8332.08]  for the creators that we have.
[8332.38 --> 8336.28]  And then if that results
[8336.28 --> 8337.98]  in us gaining new creators,
[8337.98 --> 8339.00]  then great.
[8339.16 --> 8340.48]  And if it results in the creators
[8340.48 --> 8342.12]  that we currently have being happier,
[8342.24 --> 8343.34]  then fantastic.
[8343.58 --> 8344.32]  And that's it.
[8344.32 --> 8347.10]  But our batting average
[8347.10 --> 8349.36]  is extremely low
[8349.36 --> 8351.04]  for doing things for other creators
[8351.04 --> 8352.22]  that then results in them
[8352.22 --> 8353.68]  actually joining the platform.
[8353.88 --> 8355.18]  The literal only time
[8355.18 --> 8357.12]  that that has actually ever worked
[8357.12 --> 8360.00]  was the OpenSauce team with Sauce Plus,
[8361.68 --> 8363.40]  which was the biggest bet
[8363.40 --> 8364.84]  that we ever made in that working.
[8365.00 --> 8367.78]  So I'm happy that it turned out.
[8367.78 --> 8369.46]  Yeah.
[8374.50 --> 8375.76]  Feel free to hit us, Dan.
[8376.18 --> 8376.44]  Sure.
[8377.18 --> 8378.72]  Our IT department just removed
[8378.72 --> 8380.40]  user admin privileges
[8380.40 --> 8382.18]  and uninstalled almost all software,
[8382.44 --> 8384.06]  so we can't 3D print, etc.
[8384.50 --> 8384.86]  Question,
[8385.14 --> 8386.66]  where is the line between cybersecurity
[8386.66 --> 8389.00]  and B being able to get work done?
[8389.16 --> 8389.50]  Yes,
[8389.54 --> 8391.36]  that is a really good question,
[8391.56 --> 8392.56]  Dan and Luke.
[8392.66 --> 8394.32]  Feel free to address this
[8394.32 --> 8396.70]  because I was trying to...
[8396.70 --> 8398.36]  So this was a WAN show
[8398.36 --> 8399.14]  a few weeks ago.
[8399.14 --> 8399.16]  Not my department.
[8399.44 --> 8400.38]  This was a WAN show
[8400.38 --> 8401.24]  a few weeks ago.
[8401.52 --> 8403.40]  I was trying to get
[8403.40 --> 8404.62]  a microphone working
[8404.62 --> 8406.34]  and I couldn't install
[8406.34 --> 8408.12]  the driver,
[8408.38 --> 8409.34]  then I couldn't install
[8409.34 --> 8409.96]  the software,
[8410.30 --> 8411.40]  then I couldn't install
[8411.40 --> 8412.44]  some dependency
[8412.44 --> 8413.64]  in order to get
[8413.64 --> 8415.58]  my stupid Elgato microphone,
[8415.72 --> 8416.36]  the one that is right
[8416.36 --> 8417.60]  in front of Luke right now.
[8417.76 --> 8419.10]  I was trying to get that working
[8419.10 --> 8419.64]  and I couldn't
[8419.64 --> 8420.94]  on my stupid work laptop
[8420.94 --> 8421.62]  and I basically,
[8421.92 --> 8422.88]  in a fit of rage,
[8422.98 --> 8423.20]  said,
[8423.64 --> 8424.68]  turn this off
[8424.68 --> 8425.66]  on my laptop
[8425.66 --> 8426.64]  right now
[8426.64 --> 8428.12]  because I need to be able to work
[8428.12 --> 8429.42]  and I'm sure that
[8429.42 --> 8431.76]  we've all felt that feeling
[8431.76 --> 8434.38]  while still at the same time
[8434.38 --> 8435.58]  fully understanding
[8435.58 --> 8436.70]  the importance
[8436.70 --> 8438.82]  of these protection mechanisms
[8438.82 --> 8440.26]  and recognizing
[8440.26 --> 8441.82]  the kinds of catastrophes
[8441.82 --> 8442.80]  that they can prevent.
[8443.02 --> 8444.76]  So how do we balance that, Luke?
[8445.30 --> 8446.48]  In that situation,
[8446.58 --> 8447.16]  I think it was
[8447.16 --> 8448.10]  the right tool
[8448.10 --> 8449.44]  applied to the wrong people,
[8449.54 --> 8450.58]  if that makes sense.
[8450.94 --> 8453.72]  I think like,
[8454.08 --> 8454.96]  it's tough
[8454.96 --> 8455.72]  because we,
[8455.98 --> 8457.32]  as an IT team,
[8458.00 --> 8459.20]  overreacted
[8459.20 --> 8463.76]  to us having security issues.
[8464.54 --> 8467.28]  We had the hack a while ago
[8467.28 --> 8468.48]  and then we had
[8468.48 --> 8469.78]  the barbecuing
[8469.78 --> 8471.18]  more recently.
[8471.84 --> 8473.02]  We also have
[8473.02 --> 8476.88]  this guy
[8476.88 --> 8479.94]  who needs to do
[8479.94 --> 8481.50]  a huge variety
[8481.50 --> 8482.10]  of things
[8482.10 --> 8483.02]  with his devices.
[8483.34 --> 8483.66]  Oh, me.
[8483.74 --> 8484.70]  So it's hard to like
[8484.70 --> 8485.68]  lock them down.
[8485.68 --> 8486.56]  And I have so many devices.
[8487.12 --> 8488.74]  And so many devices.
[8489.04 --> 8489.58]  Always changing.
[8490.18 --> 8490.86]  Those devices
[8490.86 --> 8491.86]  are often like
[8491.86 --> 8493.48]  given to other people
[8493.48 --> 8494.98]  for certain periods of time
[8494.98 --> 8496.22]  and then also
[8496.22 --> 8496.84]  he'll have like
[8496.84 --> 8498.00]  three phones at once
[8498.00 --> 8499.44]  but he doesn't want to
[8499.44 --> 8500.52]  actually migrate
[8500.52 --> 8501.50]  his security tools
[8501.50 --> 8502.14]  from one phone
[8502.14 --> 8502.62]  to another
[8502.62 --> 8503.42]  ever.
[8503.42 --> 8505.98]  It's a pain.
[8506.40 --> 8507.60]  It's a hassle.
[8508.80 --> 8509.76]  We're tasked with
[8509.76 --> 8510.58]  one second.
[8512.98 --> 8514.86]  Oh, fun.
[8515.00 --> 8515.46]  Fun times.
[8515.88 --> 8517.24]  We're tasked with
[8517.24 --> 8519.76]  securing something
[8519.76 --> 8521.38]  that is under
[8521.38 --> 8522.84]  a decent amount of attack
[8522.84 --> 8527.16]  with custom tailored attacks
[8527.16 --> 8527.76]  as well
[8527.76 --> 8531.80]  that most of the people
[8531.80 --> 8532.86]  not most of the people
[8532.86 --> 8534.62]  that a lot of the people
[8534.62 --> 8535.90]  here can't have
[8535.90 --> 8537.16]  advanced security
[8537.16 --> 8539.32]  or else it impacts
[8539.32 --> 8539.86]  their ability to do
[8539.86 --> 8540.34]  their jobs
[8540.34 --> 8540.96]  in some cases
[8540.96 --> 8542.38]  or just extremely
[8542.38 --> 8543.14]  slows them down
[8543.14 --> 8543.70]  in other cases.
[8543.72 --> 8544.42]  Writing team would be
[8544.42 --> 8545.58]  a great example of that.
[8545.82 --> 8546.74]  Like it's literally
[8546.74 --> 8547.84]  their job to install
[8547.84 --> 8548.64]  random software
[8548.64 --> 8549.96]  that nobody ever heard of.
[8550.12 --> 8550.26]  You know?
[8550.38 --> 8550.52]  Yeah.
[8551.30 --> 8552.22]  But then they're also
[8552.22 --> 8552.98]  major targets
[8552.98 --> 8553.60]  because a lot of them
[8553.60 --> 8555.66]  have public facing
[8555.66 --> 8556.52]  really high level
[8556.52 --> 8557.46]  access to different things.
[8557.46 --> 8559.34]  So it's tough
[8559.34 --> 8561.16]  and we've made mistakes there.
[8561.32 --> 8562.80]  We've pushed security
[8562.80 --> 8563.52]  too much
[8563.52 --> 8564.64]  in a way that
[8564.64 --> 8566.10]  negatively impacted people
[8566.10 --> 8566.54]  to the point
[8566.54 --> 8568.04]  where their ability
[8568.04 --> 8568.62]  to do their jobs
[8568.62 --> 8569.60]  was impacted enough
[8569.60 --> 8570.96]  that they were very frustrated.
[8571.10 --> 8571.94]  This has happened.
[8572.44 --> 8573.46]  In one of those cases
[8573.46 --> 8575.44]  we used a really fantastic tool
[8575.44 --> 8578.44]  but we tried to deploy it
[8578.44 --> 8580.52]  I was going to say site-wide
[8580.52 --> 8582.18]  but I mean like company-wide
[8582.18 --> 8585.48]  and it technically still is
[8585.48 --> 8586.98]  but we tried to deploy it
[8586.98 --> 8588.08]  in like a really low level
[8588.08 --> 8588.50]  for them
[8588.50 --> 8589.16]  and it just didn't work
[8589.16 --> 8589.96]  for them like at all.
[8590.84 --> 8592.30]  So how it's currently working
[8592.30 --> 8593.36]  is we have it in like
[8593.36 --> 8594.54]  a listening mode
[8594.54 --> 8595.08]  so it's not actually
[8595.08 --> 8595.70]  doing anything
[8595.70 --> 8596.86]  and if we detect a problem
[8596.86 --> 8597.76]  we can crank it up
[8597.76 --> 8599.26]  so it's already on the system
[8599.26 --> 8601.92]  which is I think
[8601.92 --> 8603.00]  the better way to use it
[8603.00 --> 8603.58]  but that's not how
[8603.58 --> 8604.50]  we initially deployed it
[8604.50 --> 8604.98]  so it created
[8604.98 --> 8605.88]  some frustrations
[8605.88 --> 8607.08]  and I think this type
[8607.08 --> 8607.92]  of thing will
[8607.92 --> 8611.20]  somewhat always
[8611.20 --> 8611.98]  be a problem
[8611.98 --> 8614.16]  but we're trying
[8614.16 --> 8615.24]  to find the fine balance
[8615.24 --> 8616.66]  between not just
[8616.66 --> 8617.30]  leaving the door
[8617.30 --> 8618.12]  completely open
[8618.12 --> 8620.88]  but still allowing people
[8620.88 --> 8621.74]  to do their jobs
[8621.74 --> 8622.54]  with as little friction
[8622.54 --> 8623.24]  as possible.
[8623.24 --> 8625.74]  It frustrates me
[8625.74 --> 8626.36]  to no end
[8626.36 --> 8627.32]  that you know
[8627.32 --> 8628.50]  to log into something
[8628.50 --> 8629.36]  I have to do like
[8629.36 --> 8630.56]  a song dance
[8630.56 --> 8634.38]  and just waste
[8634.38 --> 8635.18]  a ton of time
[8635.18 --> 8636.04]  and all this other
[8636.04 --> 8636.40]  kind of stuff
[8636.40 --> 8637.26]  but then I also understand
[8637.26 --> 8637.96]  that my accounts
[8637.96 --> 8638.80]  if compromised
[8638.80 --> 8641.00]  would be really bad.
[8642.28 --> 8643.38]  Sean in Flowplane chat
[8643.38 --> 8643.92]  just said
[8643.92 --> 8644.80]  if there were no users
[8644.80 --> 8645.78]  my job would be simple.
[8647.02 --> 8647.22]  Yeah.
[8648.10 --> 8649.28]  So it is what it is.
[8649.28 --> 8651.00]  Yeah standing
[8651.00 --> 8652.00]  in the unemployment line
[8652.00 --> 8653.72]  is a simple job.
[8656.32 --> 8657.14]  To be clear
[8657.14 --> 8658.30]  it's not a threat
[8658.30 --> 8659.40]  or an attack at Sean.
[8659.52 --> 8660.14]  Sean's amazing
[8660.14 --> 8660.80]  we love Sean.
[8661.32 --> 8662.46]  I just mean like
[8662.46 --> 8663.36]  if there were no users
[8663.36 --> 8663.90]  you wouldn't need
[8663.90 --> 8664.82]  an IT admin either.
[8665.84 --> 8666.10]  Yeah.
[8666.38 --> 8666.60]  Yeah.
[8666.78 --> 8668.16]  So it's one of those things
[8668.16 --> 8668.72]  where it's like
[8668.72 --> 8670.36]  you have like
[8670.36 --> 8671.42]  a horrible
[8671.42 --> 8672.56]  aggressive chicken
[8672.56 --> 8673.50]  and a rotten egg.
[8674.06 --> 8674.76]  You know you have to
[8674.76 --> 8676.92]  you can't have
[8676.92 --> 8677.72]  an IT department
[8677.72 --> 8678.52]  without users
[8678.52 --> 8679.10]  you can't have
[8679.10 --> 8679.78]  users without
[8679.78 --> 8680.58]  an IT department
[8680.58 --> 8681.58]  they're always kind of
[8681.58 --> 8682.90]  at odds with each other
[8682.90 --> 8683.40]  a little bit.
[8683.92 --> 8685.04]  It's an interesting company
[8685.04 --> 8685.82]  to do things at too
[8685.82 --> 8686.06]  right?
[8686.14 --> 8686.58]  Because like
[8686.58 --> 8688.26]  we'll do something
[8688.26 --> 8689.44]  and we'll have
[8689.44 --> 8691.16]  three quarters of the company
[8691.16 --> 8692.42]  not even notice.
[8693.24 --> 8693.54]  Yep.
[8693.96 --> 8694.62]  And like it is
[8694.62 --> 8696.18]  intense levels of lockdown
[8696.18 --> 8697.16]  and they don't even notice
[8697.16 --> 8698.04]  because we've done
[8698.04 --> 8698.96]  we've done
[8698.96 --> 8699.92]  a lot of
[8699.92 --> 8700.78]  pre-planning
[8700.78 --> 8702.72]  to try to catch
[8702.72 --> 8703.44]  as many use cases
[8703.44 --> 8703.94]  as we can
[8703.94 --> 8704.76]  and then
[8704.76 --> 8705.60]  that same thing
[8705.60 --> 8706.74]  will apply to another department
[8706.74 --> 8708.50]  and like seconds into it
[8708.50 --> 8708.88]  they're like
[8708.88 --> 8709.94]  I cannot function
[8709.94 --> 8711.40]  everything is ruined.
[8711.56 --> 8712.08]  Turn this off
[8712.08 --> 8712.70]  now.
[8713.56 --> 8714.64]  So we have to have
[8714.64 --> 8715.44]  stuff that's like
[8715.44 --> 8716.48]  you know
[8716.48 --> 8717.24]  custom tailored
[8717.24 --> 8717.90]  to all these different
[8717.90 --> 8718.76]  departments and stuff
[8718.76 --> 8719.52]  and that's getting easier
[8719.52 --> 8720.08]  and easier to do
[8720.08 --> 8720.76]  over time.
[8722.20 --> 8722.60]  It's
[8722.60 --> 8723.30]  yeah.
[8724.30 --> 8724.94]  Yeah yeah yeah.
[8725.12 --> 8725.54]  It's alright.
[8725.54 --> 8726.10]  Alright.
[8726.10 --> 8727.34]  Alright.
[8729.16 --> 8730.50]  How long
[8730.50 --> 8731.30]  do you think
[8731.30 --> 8731.68]  before
[8731.68 --> 8732.40]  RISC-V
[8732.40 --> 8733.16]  architectures
[8733.16 --> 8733.68]  disrupt the
[8733.68 --> 8734.72]  x86 marketplace
[8734.72 --> 8735.78]  for Intel
[8735.78 --> 8736.50]  and AMD?
[8736.80 --> 8737.54]  At least a few
[8737.54 --> 8738.12]  more years.
[8740.32 --> 8741.04]  Soon.
[8741.76 --> 8742.58]  But soon.
[8742.98 --> 8743.24]  Yeah.
[8744.30 --> 8745.16]  I mean
[8745.16 --> 8749.44]  x86
[8749.44 --> 8750.34]  yeah that's going
[8750.34 --> 8751.06]  to be a little
[8751.06 --> 8751.44]  while
[8751.44 --> 8752.06]  but in terms
[8752.06 --> 8752.38]  of like
[8752.38 --> 8753.24]  embedded devices
[8753.24 --> 8753.78]  it's happening
[8753.78 --> 8754.08]  now.
[8754.08 --> 8758.82]  Thanks for
[8758.82 --> 8759.50]  the discounts.
[8759.90 --> 8760.40]  What do you think
[8760.40 --> 8760.82]  would happen
[8760.82 --> 8761.64]  to Valve
[8761.64 --> 8762.28]  or Steam
[8762.28 --> 8763.40]  if Gaben
[8763.40 --> 8764.52]  weren't to
[8764.52 --> 8765.34]  step down
[8765.34 --> 8766.10]  without a
[8766.10 --> 8767.08]  succession plan?
[8767.46 --> 8768.28]  I fear the changes
[8768.28 --> 8769.04]  that would happen
[8769.04 --> 8769.76]  if Valve
[8769.76 --> 8770.50]  went public.
[8771.18 --> 8771.82]  Valve is one of
[8771.82 --> 8772.32]  those companies
[8772.32 --> 8773.72]  that clearly has
[8773.72 --> 8774.66]  a guiding
[8774.66 --> 8775.42]  north star
[8775.42 --> 8776.10]  that is
[8776.10 --> 8776.70]  not
[8776.70 --> 8778.10]  only
[8778.10 --> 8779.34]  how to
[8779.34 --> 8780.00]  make enough
[8780.00 --> 8780.70]  money to buy
[8780.70 --> 8781.54]  the earth
[8781.54 --> 8782.20]  and all the heavens
[8782.20 --> 8782.96]  and all of the
[8782.96 --> 8784.12]  large ships
[8784.12 --> 8785.02]  that sail
[8785.02 --> 8785.60]  within them
[8785.60 --> 8788.82]  and I
[8788.82 --> 8789.96]  share the same
[8789.96 --> 8790.40]  concern
[8790.40 --> 8792.04]  because Steam
[8792.04 --> 8793.26]  is not a monopoly
[8793.26 --> 8794.36]  because they do
[8794.36 --> 8795.12]  have legitimate
[8795.12 --> 8795.72]  competition
[8795.72 --> 8796.30]  but they are
[8796.30 --> 8797.06]  absolutely a
[8797.06 --> 8797.82]  behemoth in the
[8797.82 --> 8798.20]  space
[8798.20 --> 8799.50]  and whatever
[8799.50 --> 8800.24]  they do
[8800.24 --> 8801.02]  it's like how
[8801.02 --> 8801.42]  I'm always
[8801.42 --> 8802.10]  whining about
[8802.10 --> 8802.74]  whatever Apple
[8802.74 --> 8803.04]  does
[8803.04 --> 8803.82]  because they're
[8803.82 --> 8804.66]  so powerful
[8804.66 --> 8806.02]  in the space
[8806.02 --> 8806.44]  that whatever
[8806.44 --> 8806.90]  they do
[8806.90 --> 8807.44]  is ultimately
[8807.44 --> 8807.98]  going to spread
[8807.98 --> 8808.74]  everywhere else
[8808.74 --> 8809.86]  and so as long
[8809.86 --> 8810.36]  as Valve
[8810.36 --> 8811.36]  continues to do
[8811.36 --> 8812.00]  things that are
[8812.00 --> 8812.66]  good and are
[8812.66 --> 8813.52]  largely beneficial
[8813.52 --> 8814.10]  for gamers
[8814.10 --> 8815.52]  then the gaming
[8815.52 --> 8816.30]  space will
[8816.30 --> 8817.28]  be improved
[8817.28 --> 8817.82]  by that
[8817.82 --> 8818.52]  but if Valve
[8818.52 --> 8819.18]  were to become
[8819.18 --> 8819.98]  more restrictive
[8819.98 --> 8821.38]  or become
[8821.38 --> 8822.56]  more anti-consumer
[8822.56 --> 8823.22]  then I think
[8823.22 --> 8823.56]  that would
[8823.56 --> 8824.20]  proliferate
[8824.20 --> 8824.72]  everywhere
[8824.72 --> 8826.50]  yeah
[8826.50 --> 8827.50]  I fear
[8827.50 --> 8827.84]  what would
[8827.84 --> 8828.14]  change
[8828.14 --> 8828.64]  if Valve
[8828.64 --> 8829.08]  went public
[8829.08 --> 8829.52]  as well
[8829.52 --> 8830.64]  yeah
[8830.64 --> 8831.10]  this was a
[8831.10 --> 8831.50]  speculation
[8831.50 --> 8832.10]  I don't know
[8832.10 --> 8832.54]  if it was
[8832.54 --> 8833.92]  on our subreddit
[8833.92 --> 8834.74]  because someone
[8834.74 --> 8835.86]  like cross-posted it
[8835.86 --> 8836.34]  or if it was
[8836.34 --> 8836.98]  on our subreddit
[8836.98 --> 8837.48]  because someone
[8837.48 --> 8838.40]  originated it there
[8838.40 --> 8839.36]  but this was
[8839.36 --> 8840.40]  a discussion
[8840.40 --> 8842.04]  on the subreddit
[8842.04 --> 8842.42]  recently
[8842.42 --> 8842.92]  and it was
[8842.92 --> 8847.14]  it was
[8847.14 --> 8847.72]  concerning
[8847.72 --> 8848.30]  that was
[8848.30 --> 8848.66]  I think
[8848.66 --> 8849.08]  one of those
[8849.08 --> 8849.48]  moments
[8849.48 --> 8850.22]  where it's like
[8850.22 --> 8851.04]  you know
[8851.04 --> 8851.96]  nothing is
[8851.96 --> 8853.06]  as permanent
[8853.06 --> 8854.04]  as it may seem
[8854.04 --> 8854.56]  because like
[8854.56 --> 8855.34]  for pretty much
[8855.34 --> 8856.76]  close to the
[8856.76 --> 8857.50]  entire history
[8857.50 --> 8858.22]  of what I remember
[8858.22 --> 8859.78]  of gaming
[8859.78 --> 8860.62]  with an internet
[8860.62 --> 8861.16]  connection
[8861.16 --> 8862.78]  Steam has existed
[8862.78 --> 8863.24]  for me
[8863.24 --> 8863.58]  it's been there
[8863.58 --> 8863.86]  for you
[8863.86 --> 8865.00]  yeah
[8865.00 --> 8865.86]  and then
[8865.86 --> 8866.58]  the idea
[8866.58 --> 8867.44]  of it being
[8867.44 --> 8868.22]  significantly
[8868.22 --> 8868.80]  compromised
[8868.80 --> 8869.46]  is like
[8869.46 --> 8870.24]  something that
[8870.24 --> 8871.00]  hasn't really
[8871.00 --> 8871.82]  been a concern
[8871.82 --> 8873.00]  you know
[8873.00 --> 8873.32]  there's
[8873.32 --> 8873.68]  there's
[8873.68 --> 8874.38]  concerns
[8874.38 --> 8874.98]  with it
[8874.98 --> 8875.42]  taking a
[8875.42 --> 8876.24]  30% cut
[8876.24 --> 8876.92]  from developers
[8876.92 --> 8877.40]  and stuff
[8877.40 --> 8878.08]  sure it is
[8878.08 --> 8880.54]  how they
[8880.54 --> 8881.12]  treat the
[8881.12 --> 8881.54]  user
[8881.54 --> 8882.22]  has never
[8882.22 --> 8882.54]  actually
[8882.54 --> 8882.98]  really been
[8882.98 --> 8883.54]  a concern
[8883.54 --> 8886.86]  and
[8886.86 --> 8887.56]  the user
[8887.56 --> 8888.24]  aka the
[8888.24 --> 8888.74]  source of
[8888.74 --> 8889.10]  skin
[8889.10 --> 8890.18]  skins milk
[8890.18 --> 8893.52]  to be
[8893.52 --> 8893.70]  clear
[8893.70 --> 8894.26]  not everything
[8894.26 --> 8894.58]  Valve
[8894.58 --> 8894.88]  does
[8894.88 --> 8895.30]  is like
[8895.30 --> 8895.82]  super
[8895.82 --> 8896.38]  you know
[8896.38 --> 8897.02]  great
[8897.02 --> 8898.94]  not at all
[8898.94 --> 8899.90]  but but I
[8899.90 --> 8900.46]  think they
[8900.46 --> 8900.98]  are
[8900.98 --> 8903.02]  pretty clearly
[8903.02 --> 8903.58]  the best
[8903.58 --> 8903.96]  out of the
[8903.96 --> 8904.78]  various options
[8904.78 --> 8907.72]  and we'll
[8907.72 --> 8908.06]  see what
[8908.06 --> 8908.44]  happens
[8908.44 --> 8909.04]  when he
[8909.04 --> 8909.60]  when he
[8909.60 --> 8910.06]  eventually
[8910.06 --> 8910.56]  must
[8910.56 --> 8911.48]  leave us
[8911.48 --> 8912.36]  so
[8912.36 --> 8913.16]  Sikaias
[8913.16 --> 8913.48]  asks
[8913.48 --> 8913.88]  there's no
[8913.88 --> 8914.26]  point for
[8914.26 --> 8914.56]  Valve to
[8914.56 --> 8914.94]  go public
[8914.94 --> 8915.38]  though right
[8915.38 --> 8916.00]  they make
[8916.00 --> 8916.30]  so much
[8916.30 --> 8916.60]  money
[8916.60 --> 8916.90]  do they
[8916.90 --> 8917.16]  have to
[8917.16 --> 8917.54]  go public
[8917.54 --> 8917.94]  if Gabe
[8917.94 --> 8918.20]  dies
[8918.20 --> 8918.78]  without a
[8918.78 --> 8919.00]  proper
[8919.00 --> 8919.48]  replacement
[8919.48 --> 8920.26]  would it
[8920.26 --> 8920.64]  even make
[8920.64 --> 8921.32]  financial sense
[8921.32 --> 8921.60]  to go
[8921.60 --> 8921.90]  public
[8921.90 --> 8922.78]  so
[8922.78 --> 8923.66]  going
[8923.66 --> 8924.04]  public
[8924.04 --> 8924.84]  would be
[8924.84 --> 8925.42]  a way
[8925.42 --> 8926.00]  for them
[8926.00 --> 8926.30]  to be
[8926.30 --> 8926.72]  owned
[8926.72 --> 8927.46]  by
[8927.46 --> 8928.62]  you know
[8928.62 --> 8929.14]  the people
[8929.14 --> 8931.04]  but realistically
[8931.04 --> 8931.52]  it would
[8931.52 --> 8932.22]  probably be
[8932.22 --> 8932.68]  a bunch
[8932.68 --> 8932.92]  of
[8932.92 --> 8933.96]  private
[8933.96 --> 8934.32]  equity
[8934.32 --> 8935.00]  firms
[8935.00 --> 8937.94]  isn't it
[8937.94 --> 8938.08]  like
[8938.08 --> 8938.80]  1%
[8938.80 --> 8939.06]  of people
[8939.06 --> 8939.26]  own
[8939.26 --> 8939.46]  I think
[8939.46 --> 8939.54]  it's
[8939.54 --> 8939.66]  like
[8939.66 --> 8940.38]  97%
[8940.38 --> 8940.52]  of
[8940.52 --> 8940.82]  stocks
[8940.82 --> 8941.16]  or some
[8941.16 --> 8941.54]  crazy
[8941.54 --> 8941.92]  crap
[8941.92 --> 8942.34]  like that
[8942.34 --> 8942.86]  I don't
[8942.86 --> 8943.14]  remember
[8943.14 --> 8943.52]  the exact
[8943.52 --> 8943.80]  numbers
[8943.80 --> 8944.06]  I don't
[8944.06 --> 8944.22]  think
[8944.22 --> 8944.38]  they're
[8944.38 --> 8944.60]  quite
[8944.60 --> 8944.80]  that
[8944.80 --> 8945.12]  extreme
[8945.12 --> 8945.46]  but it
[8945.46 --> 8945.66]  is
[8945.66 --> 8945.98]  quite
[8945.98 --> 8946.38]  extreme
[8946.38 --> 8948.42]  and then
[8948.42 --> 8948.92]  but if
[8948.92 --> 8949.28]  they sold
[8949.28 --> 8949.60]  to
[8949.60 --> 8950.00]  private
[8950.00 --> 8950.24]  equity
[8950.24 --> 8950.58]  so the
[8950.58 --> 8950.88]  problem
[8950.88 --> 8951.36]  the problem
[8951.36 --> 8951.68]  with an
[8951.68 --> 8952.02]  asset
[8952.02 --> 8952.42]  like
[8952.42 --> 8952.94]  Valve
[8952.94 --> 8953.94]  is that
[8953.94 --> 8954.60]  the only
[8954.60 --> 8955.08]  entities
[8955.08 --> 8955.62]  that can
[8955.62 --> 8955.92]  afford
[8955.92 --> 8956.44]  to buy
[8956.44 --> 8956.66]  it
[8956.66 --> 8957.38]  are the
[8957.38 --> 8957.68]  kinds
[8957.68 --> 8958.22]  of entities
[8958.22 --> 8958.92]  that have
[8958.92 --> 8959.62]  accumulated
[8959.62 --> 8960.42]  so much
[8960.42 --> 8961.02]  wealth
[8961.02 --> 8962.04]  usually
[8962.04 --> 8962.68]  through not
[8962.68 --> 8963.10]  giving a
[8963.10 --> 8963.52]  f*** about
[8963.52 --> 8964.02]  anything other
[8964.02 --> 8964.34]  than the
[8964.34 --> 8964.74]  acquisition
[8964.74 --> 8965.40]  of wealth
[8965.40 --> 8966.38]  that you
[8966.38 --> 8966.68]  wouldn't
[8966.68 --> 8967.12]  really want
[8967.12 --> 8967.36]  them to
[8967.36 --> 8967.64]  be in
[8967.64 --> 8968.00]  charge of
[8968.00 --> 8968.20]  something
[8968.20 --> 8968.50]  that you
[8968.50 --> 8968.90]  want to
[8968.90 --> 8969.42]  care about
[8969.42 --> 8969.66]  you
[8969.66 --> 8971.04]  that's
[8971.04 --> 8971.84]  the problem
[8971.84 --> 8973.06]  and if
[8973.06 --> 8973.96]  Gaben were
[8973.96 --> 8974.48]  to just
[8974.48 --> 8974.82]  like
[8974.82 --> 8976.04]  bequeath it
[8976.04 --> 8976.46]  to the
[8976.46 --> 8977.30]  employees of
[8977.30 --> 8977.74]  Valve or
[8977.74 --> 8978.24]  something like
[8978.24 --> 8979.32]  that that
[8979.32 --> 8979.84]  would be
[8979.84 --> 8980.40]  extremely
[8980.40 --> 8981.00]  complicated
[8981.00 --> 8981.40]  too
[8981.40 --> 8982.36]  the tax
[8982.36 --> 8982.72]  bill
[8982.72 --> 8983.92]  on such
[8983.92 --> 8984.64]  a bequeathment
[8984.64 --> 8985.34]  would probably
[8985.34 --> 8986.10]  bankrupt them
[8986.10 --> 8986.56]  all before
[8986.56 --> 8987.02]  they could
[8987.02 --> 8987.94]  get a benefit
[8987.94 --> 8988.72]  from owning
[8988.72 --> 8989.30]  it anyway
[8989.30 --> 8990.32]  uh
[8990.32 --> 8990.80]  we actually
[8990.80 --> 8990.98]  may
[8990.98 --> 8991.16]  no
[8991.16 --> 8991.44]  Valve
[8991.44 --> 8991.96]  is so
[8991.96 --> 8992.46]  profitable
[8992.46 --> 8992.92]  that maybe
[8992.92 --> 8993.32]  not
[8993.32 --> 8994.62]  either way
[8994.62 --> 8994.98]  it would
[8994.98 --> 8995.32]  be
[8995.32 --> 8996.68]  legally
[8996.68 --> 8997.38]  complicated
[8997.38 --> 8998.10]  and
[8998.10 --> 9001.16]  from a
[9001.16 --> 9001.70]  corporate
[9001.70 --> 9004.00]  governance
[9004.00 --> 9004.72]  standpoint
[9004.72 --> 9005.48]  I don't
[9005.48 --> 9005.80]  know that
[9005.80 --> 9006.48]  I'm convinced
[9006.48 --> 9007.06]  that that
[9007.06 --> 9007.58]  would be
[9007.58 --> 9008.38]  a great
[9008.38 --> 9009.24]  system
[9009.24 --> 9010.58]  anyway
[9010.58 --> 9012.06]  um
[9012.06 --> 9013.20]  like
[9013.20 --> 9013.56]  like
[9013.56 --> 9014.60]  so what
[9014.60 --> 9014.88]  Valve
[9014.88 --> 9015.34]  would go
[9015.34 --> 9015.62]  like
[9015.62 --> 9016.12]  co-op
[9016.12 --> 9016.64]  essentially
[9016.64 --> 9017.62]  I don't
[9017.62 --> 9017.84]  know
[9017.84 --> 9018.24]  I have
[9018.24 --> 9018.64]  I have
[9018.64 --> 9019.02]  I mean
[9019.02 --> 9019.60]  I'm not
[9019.60 --> 9019.98]  personal
[9019.98 --> 9020.50]  friends with
[9020.50 --> 9020.82]  Gaben
[9020.82 --> 9021.14]  we've
[9021.14 --> 9021.46]  exchanged
[9021.46 --> 9021.82]  emails
[9021.82 --> 9022.24]  once
[9022.24 --> 9022.62]  I think
[9022.62 --> 9024.70]  I don't
[9024.70 --> 9025.26]  even know
[9025.26 --> 9025.46]  if he
[9025.46 --> 9025.70]  actually
[9025.70 --> 9026.10]  replied
[9026.10 --> 9026.36]  I don't
[9026.36 --> 9026.66]  remember
[9026.66 --> 9027.44]  but the
[9027.44 --> 9028.10]  point is
[9028.10 --> 9029.02]  um
[9029.02 --> 9029.50]  I worry
[9029.50 --> 9029.96]  about it
[9029.96 --> 9030.58]  and
[9030.58 --> 9030.98]  and I
[9030.98 --> 9031.20]  don't
[9031.20 --> 9031.44]  think
[9031.44 --> 9031.70]  the
[9031.70 --> 9032.12]  succession
[9032.12 --> 9033.42]  is
[9033.42 --> 9033.84]  or will
[9033.84 --> 9034.14]  be
[9034.14 --> 9034.62]  simple
[9034.62 --> 9036.40]  so
[9036.40 --> 9036.74]  apparently
[9036.74 --> 9036.98]  the
[9036.98 --> 9037.20]  top
[9037.20 --> 9037.68]  1%
[9037.68 --> 9038.00]  own
[9038.00 --> 9038.50]  roughly
[9038.50 --> 9039.50]  50%
[9039.50 --> 9039.70]  of
[9039.70 --> 9039.96]  all
[9039.96 --> 9040.26]  corporate
[9040.26 --> 9040.72]  entities
[9040.72 --> 9041.02]  and
[9041.02 --> 9041.32]  mutual
[9041.32 --> 9041.64]  fund
[9041.64 --> 9042.00]  shares
[9042.00 --> 9043.04]  the
[9043.04 --> 9043.82]  combined
[9043.82 --> 9044.34]  top
[9044.34 --> 9044.96]  10%
[9044.96 --> 9045.24]  of
[9045.24 --> 9045.58]  people
[9045.58 --> 9046.64]  own
[9046.64 --> 9047.90]  87%
[9047.90 --> 9048.10]  of
[9048.10 --> 9048.24]  the
[9048.24 --> 9048.54]  market
[9048.54 --> 9049.74]  um
[9049.74 --> 9050.68]  so
[9050.68 --> 9051.80]  the
[9051.80 --> 9052.10]  chance
[9052.10 --> 9052.46]  that
[9052.46 --> 9053.08]  you know
[9053.08 --> 9054.94]  it'll be
[9054.94 --> 9055.34]  truly
[9055.34 --> 9055.72]  owned
[9055.72 --> 9056.10]  by the
[9056.10 --> 9056.40]  people
[9056.40 --> 9057.04]  is
[9057.04 --> 9057.60]  in my
[9057.60 --> 9057.90]  opinion
[9057.90 --> 9059.66]  non-existent
[9059.66 --> 9060.46]  cool
[9060.46 --> 9061.62]  next
[9061.62 --> 9062.24]  greetings
[9062.24 --> 9062.56]  from
[9062.56 --> 9062.94]  Europe
[9062.94 --> 9063.98]  I've
[9063.98 --> 9064.16]  learned
[9064.16 --> 9064.42]  a ton
[9064.42 --> 9064.58]  of
[9064.58 --> 9065.02]  management
[9065.02 --> 9065.48]  lessons
[9065.48 --> 9065.90]  from
[9065.90 --> 9066.18]  your

[9066.62 --> 9067.06]  CEO
[9067.06 --> 9067.60]  stories
[9067.60 --> 9068.24]  everything
[9068.24 --> 9068.48]  from
[9068.48 --> 9068.84]  managing
[9068.84 --> 9069.36]  cookies
[9069.36 --> 9069.72]  to
[9069.72 --> 9070.04]  people
[9070.04 --> 9070.64]  do
[9070.64 --> 9070.74]  you
[9070.74 --> 9070.88]  ever
[9070.88 --> 9071.10]  miss
[9071.10 --> 9071.42]  those
[9071.42 --> 9071.82]  challenges
[9071.82 --> 9072.20]  and
[9072.20 --> 9072.36]  the
[9072.36 --> 9072.68]  lessons
[9072.68 --> 9072.94]  they
[9072.94 --> 9073.26]  brought
[9073.26 --> 9075.10]  no
[9075.10 --> 9075.54]  I don't
[9075.54 --> 9075.76]  think
[9075.76 --> 9076.00]  so
[9076.00 --> 9076.16]  I
[9076.16 --> 9076.38]  think
[9076.38 --> 9076.90]  I'm
[9076.90 --> 9078.06]  largely
[9078.06 --> 9078.60]  glad
[9078.60 --> 9079.00]  that I
[9079.00 --> 9079.18]  have
[9079.18 --> 9079.34]  the
[9079.34 --> 9079.82]  experience
[9079.82 --> 9080.14]  that I
[9080.14 --> 9080.32]  have
[9080.32 --> 9080.74]  today
[9080.74 --> 9081.22]  even
[9081.22 --> 9081.42]  if
[9081.42 --> 9081.56]  in
[9081.56 --> 9081.80]  some
[9081.80 --> 9082.22]  cases
[9082.22 --> 9082.88]  it
[9082.88 --> 9084.18]  makes
[9084.18 --> 9084.48]  things
[9084.48 --> 9084.82]  less
[9084.82 --> 9085.34]  fun
[9085.34 --> 9085.66]  like
[9085.66 --> 9085.76]  I
[9085.76 --> 9086.06]  can't
[9086.06 --> 9086.40]  say
[9086.40 --> 9086.58]  the
[9086.58 --> 9086.82]  kind
[9086.82 --> 9086.94]  of
[9086.94 --> 9087.16]  stuff
[9087.16 --> 9087.34]  that
[9087.34 --> 9087.46]  I
[9087.46 --> 9087.66]  used
[9087.66 --> 9087.82]  to
[9087.82 --> 9088.12]  say
[9088.12 --> 9088.92]  because
[9088.92 --> 9089.38]  I
[9089.38 --> 9089.58]  you
[9089.58 --> 9089.72]  know
[9089.72 --> 9090.14]  I've
[9090.14 --> 9090.38]  learned
[9090.38 --> 9090.80]  lessons
[9090.80 --> 9091.04]  about
[9091.04 --> 9091.24]  how
[9091.24 --> 9091.50]  people
[9091.50 --> 9091.82]  will
[9091.82 --> 9092.38]  interpret
[9092.38 --> 9092.70]  it
[9092.70 --> 9093.02]  with
[9093.02 --> 9093.20]  that
[9093.20 --> 9093.56]  said
[9093.56 --> 9094.82]  if
[9094.82 --> 9095.12]  anything
[9095.12 --> 9095.40]  I've
[9095.40 --> 9095.70]  probably
[9095.70 --> 9096.14]  leaned
[9096.14 --> 9096.56]  back
[9096.56 --> 9096.88]  more
[9096.88 --> 9097.36]  YOLO
[9097.36 --> 9097.78]  lately
[9097.78 --> 9098.16]  now that
[9098.16 --> 9098.30]  I'm
[9098.30 --> 9098.60]  in my
[9098.60 --> 9098.86]  zero
[9098.86 --> 9099.38]  given
[9099.38 --> 9099.90]  phase
[9099.90 --> 9103.02]  and
[9103.02 --> 9103.32]  I
[9103.32 --> 9103.56]  don't
[9103.56 --> 9103.90]  miss
[9103.90 --> 9104.56]  being
[9104.56 --> 9105.72]  more
[9105.72 --> 9106.10]  buttoned
[9106.10 --> 9106.24]  up
[9106.24 --> 9106.50]  either
[9106.50 --> 9106.70]  I
[9106.70 --> 9106.94]  think
[9106.94 --> 9107.48]  it's
[9107.48 --> 9107.72]  always
[9107.72 --> 9108.20]  evolving
[9108.20 --> 9108.48]  and
[9108.48 --> 9108.56]  you
[9108.56 --> 9108.78]  always
[9108.78 --> 9108.96]  have
[9108.96 --> 9109.06]  to
[9109.06 --> 9109.18]  be
[9109.18 --> 9109.50]  learning
[9109.50 --> 9110.08]  and
[9110.08 --> 9110.42]  while
[9110.42 --> 9110.64]  you
[9110.64 --> 9110.98]  change
[9110.98 --> 9111.10]  and
[9111.10 --> 9111.36]  evolve
[9111.36 --> 9111.56]  the
[9111.56 --> 9111.76]  world
[9111.76 --> 9111.94]  is
[9111.94 --> 9112.24]  changing
[9112.24 --> 9112.38]  and
[9112.38 --> 9112.70]  evolving
[9112.70 --> 9113.04]  around
[9113.04 --> 9113.24]  you
[9113.24 --> 9113.40]  as
[9113.40 --> 9113.62]  well
[9113.62 --> 9113.94]  like
[9113.94 --> 9114.56]  working
[9114.56 --> 9114.90]  with
[9114.90 --> 9115.26]  the
[9115.26 --> 9115.46]  people
[9115.46 --> 9115.62]  who
[9115.62 --> 9115.70]  are
[9115.70 --> 9115.94]  joining
[9115.94 --> 9116.12]  the
[9116.12 --> 9116.34]  team
[9116.34 --> 9116.72]  today
[9116.72 --> 9117.22]  is
[9117.22 --> 9117.36]  not
[9117.36 --> 9117.52]  the
[9117.52 --> 9117.74]  same
[9117.74 --> 9117.92]  as
[9117.92 --> 9118.16]  working
[9118.16 --> 9118.36]  with

[9119.62 --> 9120.30]  12
[9120.30 --> 9120.66]  years
[9120.66 --> 9120.96]  ago
[9120.96 --> 9121.46]  anymore
[9121.46 --> 9122.44]  people
[9122.44 --> 9122.68]  have
[9122.68 --> 9123.04]  changed
[9123.04 --> 9123.36]  I've
[9123.36 --> 9123.70]  changed
[9123.70 --> 9124.06]  everything
[9124.06 --> 9124.44]  the world
[9124.44 --> 9124.62]  has
[9124.62 --> 9124.98]  changed
[9124.98 --> 9126.16]  and I
[9126.16 --> 9127.38]  no I
[9127.38 --> 9127.50]  don't
[9127.50 --> 9127.66]  think
[9127.66 --> 9127.94]  I miss
[9127.94 --> 9128.58]  it
[9128.58 --> 9129.18]  I like
[9129.18 --> 9129.50]  and I'm
[9129.50 --> 9129.76]  still
[9129.76 --> 9130.10]  learning
[9130.10 --> 9130.44]  maybe
[9130.44 --> 9130.76]  that's
[9130.76 --> 9130.92]  part
[9130.92 --> 9131.02]  of
[9131.02 --> 9131.14]  it
[9131.14 --> 9131.32]  too
[9131.32 --> 9131.46]  is
[9131.46 --> 9131.56]  if
[9131.56 --> 9131.68]  I
[9131.68 --> 9131.98]  wasn't
[9131.98 --> 9132.34]  still
[9132.34 --> 9132.70]  learning
[9132.70 --> 9132.98]  every
[9132.98 --> 9133.26]  day
[9133.26 --> 9133.96]  then
[9133.96 --> 9134.18]  I
[9134.18 --> 9134.42]  might
[9134.42 --> 9134.76]  miss
[9134.76 --> 9135.02]  that
[9135.02 --> 9135.32]  time
[9135.32 --> 9135.48]  when
[9135.48 --> 9135.60]  I
[9135.60 --> 9135.76]  was
[9135.76 --> 9136.10]  challenged
[9136.10 --> 9136.30]  and
[9136.30 --> 9136.54]  learned
[9136.54 --> 9136.82]  but
[9136.82 --> 9137.24]  every
[9137.24 --> 9138.60]  challenged
[9138.60 --> 9138.86]  in
[9138.86 --> 9139.08]  learning
[9139.08 --> 9139.30]  but
[9139.30 --> 9139.64]  now
[9139.64 --> 9140.28]  every
[9140.28 --> 9140.52]  day
[9140.52 --> 9140.68]  is
[9140.68 --> 9140.78]  a

[9141.20 --> 9141.80]  every
[9141.80 --> 9142.00]  day
[9142.00 --> 9143.36]  never
[9143.36 --> 9143.98]  stops
[9143.98 --> 9145.26]  which
[9145.26 --> 9145.52]  is
[9145.52 --> 9146.56]  good
[9146.56 --> 9147.16]  but
[9147.16 --> 9147.56]  tiring
[9147.56 --> 9149.78]  hey
[9149.78 --> 9150.30]  let's
[9150.30 --> 9150.48]  say
[9150.48 --> 9150.74]  if
[9150.74 --> 9151.68]  Linus
[9151.68 --> 9152.48]  friend
[9152.48 --> 9152.94]  Jimmy
[9152.94 --> 9153.48]  decides

[9155.02 --> 9155.44]  float
[9155.44 --> 9155.80]  plane
[9155.80 --> 9156.72]  would
[9156.72 --> 9157.14]  there
[9157.14 --> 9157.54]  be
[9157.54 --> 9159.32]  perhaps
[9159.32 --> 9159.66]  a need
[9159.66 --> 9159.80]  for
[9159.80 --> 9160.12]  a network

[9196.76 --> 9197.26]  Fallon
[9197.26 --> 9197.80]  I
[9197.80 --> 9197.94]  think
[9197.94 --> 9198.10]  you've
[9198.10 --> 9198.22]  got
[9198.22 --> 9198.36]  your

[9207.68 --> 9207.88]  flow
[9207.88 --> 9208.10]  plane
[9208.10 --> 9208.26]  what
[9208.26 --> 9208.60]  happens
[9208.60 --> 9209.60]  probably
[9209.60 --> 9209.88]  not
[9209.88 --> 9210.12]  that
[9210.12 --> 9210.48]  much
[9210.48 --> 9210.78]  to be

[9211.32 --> 9211.80]  live
[9211.80 --> 9211.98]  would
[9211.98 --> 9212.10]  be

[9212.32 --> 9212.72]  challenging
[9212.72 --> 9212.96]  if
[9212.96 --> 9213.10]  they
[9213.10 --> 9213.42]  actually

[9223.30 --> 9223.52]  nothing
[9223.52 --> 9223.70]  went

[9223.96 --> 9224.94]  it's
[9224.94 --> 9225.04]  just
[9225.04 --> 9225.16]  how
[9225.16 --> 9225.28]  the
[9225.28 --> 9225.52]  universe
[9225.52 --> 9225.90]  works

[9235.10 --> 9235.44]  had
[9235.44 --> 9235.80]  a

[9236.68 --> 9237.04]  to

[9237.98 --> 9238.42]  with
[9238.42 --> 9238.66]  the

[9240.28 --> 9240.92]  discontinued
[9240.92 --> 9241.22]  online
[9241.22 --> 9241.56]  game
[9241.56 --> 9242.02]  what
[9242.02 --> 9242.14]  would
[9242.14 --> 9242.26]  it
[9242.26 --> 9242.56]  be
[9242.56 --> 9245.40]  reawaken
[9245.40 --> 9245.78]  with
[9245.78 --> 9246.04]  the
[9246.04 --> 9246.46]  hype
[9246.46 --> 9248.52]  reawaken
[9248.52 --> 9248.92]  with
[9248.92 --> 9249.08]  the

[9249.40 --> 9249.90]  like
[9249.90 --> 9250.20]  like
[9250.20 --> 9250.88]  like
[9250.88 --> 9251.18]  like
[9251.18 --> 9251.34]  it
[9251.34 --> 9251.66]  was
[9251.66 --> 9251.86]  when
[9251.86 --> 9252.00]  it
[9252.00 --> 9252.40]  launched
[9252.40 --> 9252.66]  and
[9252.66 --> 9252.84]  like
[9252.84 --> 9253.32]  everyone's
[9253.32 --> 9253.62]  into
[9253.62 --> 9253.92]  it
[9253.92 --> 9254.08]  and
[9254.08 --> 9254.24]  the
[9254.24 --> 9254.56]  community
[9254.56 --> 9254.80]  is
[9254.80 --> 9255.18]  vibrant
[9255.18 --> 9255.44]  or
[9255.44 --> 9255.74]  whatever
[9255.74 --> 9256.12]  something
[9256.12 --> 9256.34]  like
[9256.34 --> 9256.46]  that
[9256.46 --> 9256.80]  is
[9256.80 --> 9256.90]  that
[9256.90 --> 9257.02]  what
[9257.02 --> 9257.14]  we're
[9257.14 --> 9257.34]  talking
[9257.34 --> 9257.52]  about
[9257.52 --> 9257.56]  I
[9257.56 --> 9257.72]  think
[9257.72 --> 9257.94]  pretty
[9257.94 --> 9258.24]  much
[9258.24 --> 9258.48]  just
[9258.48 --> 9258.72]  like
[9258.72 --> 9259.26]  bring
[9259.26 --> 9259.44]  one
[9259.44 --> 9259.64]  back
[9259.64 --> 9259.82]  from
[9259.82 --> 9259.94]  the
[9259.94 --> 9260.12]  dead
[9260.12 --> 9260.22]  and
[9260.22 --> 9260.48]  people
[9260.48 --> 9261.28]  are
[9261.28 --> 9261.52]  into
[9261.52 --> 9261.76]  it
[9261.76 --> 9262.24]  because
[9262.24 --> 9262.32]  it's
[9262.32 --> 9262.40]  an
[9262.40 --> 9262.58]  online
[9262.58 --> 9262.94]  game
[9262.94 --> 9263.14]  so
[9263.14 --> 9263.30]  you
[9263.30 --> 9263.52]  can't
[9263.52 --> 9263.68]  really
[9263.68 --> 9263.96]  like
[9263.96 --> 9264.56]  do
[9264.56 --> 9264.68]  it
[9264.68 --> 9264.84]  without
[9264.84 --> 9265.02]  the
[9265.02 --> 9265.32]  players
[9265.32 --> 9265.54]  right
[9265.54 --> 9267.08]  oh
[9267.08 --> 9267.38]  that's
[9267.38 --> 9267.54]  a
[9267.54 --> 9268.02]  that's
[9268.02 --> 9268.16]  a
[9268.16 --> 9268.42]  really
[9268.42 --> 9268.68]  good
[9268.68 --> 9269.22]  question
[9269.22 --> 9272.16]  man
[9272.16 --> 9272.52]  I
[9272.52 --> 9272.70]  don't
[9272.70 --> 9272.84]  I
[9272.84 --> 9273.08]  don't
[9273.08 --> 9276.14]  my
[9276.14 --> 9276.44]  problem
[9276.44 --> 9276.74]  is it's
[9276.74 --> 9277.18]  not the
[9277.18 --> 9277.70]  hype
[9277.70 --> 9278.18]  it's
[9278.18 --> 9278.46]  the
[9278.46 --> 9279.40]  culture
[9279.40 --> 9280.48]  yeah
[9280.48 --> 9280.70]  well
[9280.70 --> 9281.00]  I mean
[9281.00 --> 9281.66]  I'm
[9281.66 --> 9281.96]  assuming
[9281.96 --> 9282.20]  it's
[9282.20 --> 9282.44]  both
[9282.44 --> 9282.64]  like
[9282.64 --> 9282.78]  it's
[9282.78 --> 9282.94]  the
[9282.94 --> 9283.20]  player
[9283.20 --> 9283.58]  base
[9283.58 --> 9283.96]  and
[9283.96 --> 9284.30]  the
[9284.30 --> 9284.36]  vibe
[9284.36 --> 9284.38]  I
[9284.38 --> 9284.60]  don't
[9284.60 --> 9284.80]  know
[9284.80 --> 9284.94]  that
[9284.94 --> 9285.06]  they're
[9285.06 --> 9285.26]  hand
[9285.26 --> 9285.38]  in
[9285.38 --> 9285.50]  hand
[9285.50 --> 9285.72]  because
[9285.72 --> 9285.92]  the
[9285.92 --> 9286.16]  culture
[9286.16 --> 9286.28]  is
[9286.28 --> 9286.40]  like
[9286.40 --> 9286.54]  how
[9286.54 --> 9286.86]  people
[9286.86 --> 9287.66]  approach
[9287.66 --> 9287.88]  the
[9287.88 --> 9288.18]  game
[9288.18 --> 9288.90]  like
[9288.90 --> 9289.22]  think
[9289.22 --> 9289.46]  about
[9289.46 --> 9289.84]  how
[9289.84 --> 9290.22]  people
[9290.22 --> 9290.84]  played
[9290.84 --> 9291.86]  Counter-Strike
[9291.86 --> 9292.46]  when
[9292.46 --> 9292.64]  we
[9292.64 --> 9292.82]  were
[9292.82 --> 9293.20]  kids
[9293.20 --> 9293.78]  compared
[9293.78 --> 9293.96]  to
[9293.96 --> 9294.14]  how
[9294.14 --> 9294.40]  people
[9294.40 --> 9294.78]  play
[9294.78 --> 9295.34]  Counter-Strike
[9295.34 --> 9295.68]  now
[9298.02 --> 9298.30]  you just
[9298.30 --> 9298.48]  mean
[9298.48 --> 9298.64]  the
[9298.64 --> 9298.94]  general
[9298.94 --> 9299.36]  culture
[9299.36 --> 9299.60]  of
[9299.60 --> 9300.20]  extreme
[9300.20 --> 9301.04]  sweatiness
[9301.04 --> 9301.48]  in every
[9301.48 --> 9301.74]  element
[9301.74 --> 9302.00]  of
[9302.00 --> 9302.30]  gaming
[9302.30 --> 9303.94]  but
[9303.94 --> 9304.30]  if
[9304.30 --> 9304.48]  you
[9304.48 --> 9304.70]  could
[9304.70 --> 9304.96]  bring
[9304.96 --> 9305.30]  back
[9305.30 --> 9305.50]  the
[9305.50 --> 9305.86]  hype
[9305.86 --> 9306.08]  you
[9306.08 --> 9306.30]  could
[9306.30 --> 9306.66]  bring
[9306.66 --> 9307.08]  back
[9307.08 --> 9307.38]  a
[9307.38 --> 9307.64]  large
[9307.64 --> 9307.86]  enough
[9307.86 --> 9308.18]  player
[9308.18 --> 9308.58]  base
[9308.58 --> 9308.92]  that
[9308.92 --> 9309.18]  there'd
[9309.18 --> 9309.30]  be
[9309.30 --> 9309.56]  someone
[9309.56 --> 9309.80]  for
[9309.80 --> 9310.04]  anyone
[9310.04 --> 9310.24]  to
[9310.24 --> 9310.40]  play
[9310.40 --> 9310.70]  with
[9310.70 --> 9311.34]  I
[9311.34 --> 9311.56]  do
[9311.56 --> 9311.96]  find
[9311.96 --> 9312.18]  that
[9312.18 --> 9312.42]  that
[9312.42 --> 9312.94]  happens
[9312.94 --> 9313.46]  but
[9313.46 --> 9313.60]  I
[9313.60 --> 9313.92]  find
[9313.92 --> 9314.08]  that
[9314.08 --> 9314.22]  it
[9314.22 --> 9314.54]  only
[9314.54 --> 9315.06]  lasts
[9315.06 --> 9315.26]  for
[9315.26 --> 9316.00]  at
[9316.00 --> 9316.40]  maximum
[9316.40 --> 9316.62]  a
[9316.62 --> 9316.80]  week
[9316.80 --> 9316.94]  or
[9316.94 --> 9317.08]  two
[9317.08 --> 9317.22]  I
[9317.22 --> 9317.36]  think
[9317.36 --> 9317.50]  we
[9317.50 --> 9317.74]  saw
[9317.74 --> 9318.00]  this
[9318.00 --> 9318.68]  with
[9318.68 --> 9321.14]  Battlebit
[9321.14 --> 9322.68]  where
[9322.68 --> 9323.12]  for the
[9323.12 --> 9323.38]  first
[9323.38 --> 9323.58]  little
[9323.58 --> 9323.82]  while
[9323.82 --> 9324.26]  Battlebit
[9324.26 --> 9324.48]  it was
[9324.48 --> 9325.08]  really
[9325.08 --> 9325.44]  really
[9325.44 --> 9326.02]  fun
[9326.02 --> 9330.36]  people
[9330.36 --> 9330.72]  kind of
[9330.72 --> 9331.00]  messing
[9331.00 --> 9331.64]  around
[9331.64 --> 9332.78]  you'd
[9332.78 --> 9332.94]  have
[9332.94 --> 9333.16]  like
[9333.16 --> 9333.54]  war
[9333.54 --> 9333.98]  cries
[9333.98 --> 9334.56]  as the
[9334.56 --> 9334.86]  matches
[9334.86 --> 9335.10]  would
[9335.10 --> 9335.40]  start
[9335.40 --> 9335.62]  like
[9335.62 --> 9335.74]  it
[9335.74 --> 9335.86]  was
[9335.86 --> 9336.24]  cool
[9336.24 --> 9336.82]  and
[9336.82 --> 9336.94]  then
[9336.94 --> 9337.12]  people
[9337.12 --> 9337.32]  kind
[9337.32 --> 9337.42]  of
[9337.42 --> 9337.68]  stop
[9337.68 --> 9338.28]  talking
[9338.28 --> 9339.34]  and
[9339.34 --> 9339.96]  focusing
[9339.96 --> 9340.26]  on
[9340.26 --> 9340.44]  just
[9340.44 --> 9340.64]  kill
[9340.64 --> 9341.00]  farming
[9341.00 --> 9341.24]  instead
[9341.24 --> 9341.36]  of
[9341.36 --> 9341.60]  having
[9341.60 --> 9341.96]  fun
[9341.96 --> 9342.10]  and
[9342.10 --> 9342.28]  playing
[9342.28 --> 9342.74]  objectives
[9342.74 --> 9343.92]  and
[9343.92 --> 9344.46]  doing
[9344.46 --> 9344.70]  stuff
[9344.70 --> 9344.84]  like
[9344.84 --> 9344.98]  that
[9344.98 --> 9345.12]  that
[9345.12 --> 9345.56]  happens
[9345.56 --> 9346.38]  all
[9346.38 --> 9346.58]  of
[9346.58 --> 9346.70]  the
[9346.70 --> 9347.12]  time
[9347.12 --> 9347.92]  it's
[9347.92 --> 9348.32]  I
[9348.32 --> 9348.66]  find
[9348.66 --> 9349.12]  online
[9349.12 --> 9349.46]  gaming
[9349.46 --> 9349.74]  just
[9349.74 --> 9350.36]  objectively
[9350.36 --> 9350.78]  less
[9350.78 --> 9351.06]  fun
[9351.06 --> 9351.32]  now
[9351.32 --> 9351.60]  because
[9351.60 --> 9351.98]  everyone
[9351.98 --> 9352.34]  thinks
[9352.34 --> 9352.54]  they're
[9352.54 --> 9352.68]  going to
[9352.68 --> 9352.76]  be

[9357.06 --> 9357.60]  people
[9357.60 --> 9357.94]  are
[9357.94 --> 9358.68]  like
[9358.68 --> 9358.84]  you
[9358.84 --> 9359.06]  don't
[9359.06 --> 9359.40]  play

[9418.30 --> 9418.44]  like
[9418.44 --> 9418.54]  it
[9418.54 --> 9418.82]  makes
[9418.82 --> 9418.96]  you
[9418.96 --> 9419.26]  focus
[9419.26 --> 9419.48]  on

[9419.72 --> 9420.08]  thing
[9420.08 --> 9420.48]  and
[9420.48 --> 9420.62]  that
[9420.62 --> 9420.78]  thing
[9420.78 --> 9420.92]  is
[9420.92 --> 9421.06]  not
[9421.06 --> 9421.58]  necessarily
[9421.58 --> 9422.58]  maximizing
[9422.58 --> 9422.72]  your
[9422.72 --> 9422.88]  amount
[9422.88 --> 9423.04]  of

[9426.06 --> 9426.24]  no
[9426.24 --> 9426.52]  hats
[9426.52 --> 9426.76]  is
[9426.76 --> 9427.18]  is
[9427.18 --> 9427.60]  based
[9427.60 --> 9428.00]  yeah
[9428.00 --> 9428.80]  I like
[9428.80 --> 9429.46]  Gary's
[9429.46 --> 9429.74]  mod
[9429.74 --> 9430.24]  from

[9430.88 --> 9431.20]  12
[9431.20 --> 9432.74]  yeah
[9432.74 --> 9433.46]  yeah
[9433.46 --> 9434.80]  maybe
[9434.80 --> 9434.98]  something
[9434.98 --> 9435.32]  not
[9435.32 --> 9435.68]  sweaty
[9435.68 --> 9437.10]  my
[9437.10 --> 9437.48]  selfish
[9437.48 --> 9437.90]  answer
[9437.90 --> 9438.28]  for this
[9438.28 --> 9438.46]  one
[9438.46 --> 9438.78]  would be
[9438.78 --> 9439.08]  Supreme
[9439.08 --> 9439.54]  Commander
[9439.54 --> 9439.86]  vanilla
[9439.86 --> 9440.70]  I didn't
[9440.70 --> 9441.00]  like the
[9441.00 --> 9441.30]  changes
[9441.30 --> 9441.58]  to
[9441.58 --> 9441.90]  Forged
[9441.90 --> 9442.32]  Alliance
[9442.32 --> 9443.94]  and
[9443.94 --> 9444.30]  Supreme
[9444.30 --> 9444.66]  Commander
[9444.66 --> 9445.12]  was
[9445.12 --> 9445.88]  just
[9445.88 --> 9446.58]  goaded
[9446.58 --> 9446.82]  it was
[9446.82 --> 9447.04]  so
[9447.04 --> 9447.36]  good
[9447.36 --> 9449.92]  but
[9449.92 --> 9450.34]  I think
[9450.34 --> 9450.82]  a more
[9450.82 --> 9451.38]  realistic
[9451.38 --> 9451.90]  answer
[9451.90 --> 9452.28]  for what
[9452.28 --> 9452.42]  would
[9452.42 --> 9452.66]  give me
[9452.66 --> 9452.86]  more
[9452.86 --> 9453.28]  long-term
[9453.28 --> 9453.66]  enjoyment
[9453.66 --> 9453.88]  would
[9453.88 --> 9454.10]  probably
[9454.10 --> 9454.26]  be
[9454.26 --> 9454.42]  Left
[9454.42 --> 9454.54]  For
[9454.54 --> 9454.76]  Dead
[9454.76 --> 9456.76]  um
[9456.76 --> 9457.34]  yeah
[9457.34 --> 9457.94]  Left
[9457.94 --> 9458.06]  For
[9458.06 --> 9458.28]  Dead
[9458.28 --> 9458.72]  2
[9458.72 --> 9459.36]  added
[9459.36 --> 9459.76]  a lot
[9459.76 --> 9460.26]  I
[9460.26 --> 9460.74]  personally
[9460.74 --> 9461.04]  felt
[9461.04 --> 9461.18]  it
[9461.18 --> 9461.54]  added
[9461.54 --> 9462.04]  too
[9462.04 --> 9462.40]  much
[9462.40 --> 9463.22]  uh
[9463.22 --> 9463.38]  Left
[9463.38 --> 9463.50]  For
[9463.50 --> 9463.68]  Dead
[9463.68 --> 9464.04]  1
[9464.04 --> 9464.48]  was
[9464.48 --> 9464.90]  was
[9464.90 --> 9465.46]  tight
[9465.46 --> 9466.14]  it
[9466.14 --> 9466.62]  was
[9466.62 --> 9467.14]  um
[9467.14 --> 9467.60]  well
[9467.60 --> 9467.86]  there's
[9467.86 --> 9468.00]  only
[9468.00 --> 9468.32]  four
[9468.32 --> 9468.84]  campaigns
[9468.84 --> 9469.02]  or
[9469.02 --> 9469.22]  something
[9469.22 --> 9469.38]  I
[9469.38 --> 9469.54]  think
[9469.54 --> 9469.76]  four
[9469.76 --> 9469.92]  or
[9469.92 --> 9470.18]  six
[9470.18 --> 9470.56]  something
[9470.56 --> 9470.80]  like
[9470.80 --> 9471.10]  that
[9471.10 --> 9471.80]  and
[9471.80 --> 9471.94]  there
[9471.94 --> 9472.08]  was
[9472.08 --> 9472.26]  only
[9472.26 --> 9472.80]  four
[9472.80 --> 9473.72]  special
[9473.72 --> 9474.18]  infected
[9474.18 --> 9475.32]  um
[9475.32 --> 9475.54]  there
[9475.54 --> 9475.78]  are
[9475.78 --> 9476.24]  some
[9476.24 --> 9476.72]  areas
[9476.72 --> 9477.00]  where
[9477.00 --> 9477.22]  the
[9477.22 --> 9477.56]  new
[9477.56 --> 9478.20]  infected
[9478.20 --> 9478.62]  did
[9478.62 --> 9478.98]  balance
[9478.98 --> 9479.22]  things
[9479.22 --> 9479.46]  a little
[9479.46 --> 9479.60]  bit
[9479.60 --> 9479.78]  better
[9479.78 --> 9479.92]  I
[9479.92 --> 9480.06]  think
[9480.06 --> 9480.26]  the
[9483.28 --> 9483.72]  it
[9483.72 --> 9484.04]  kept
[9484.04 --> 9484.40]  the
[9484.40 --> 9484.92]  survivors
[9484.92 --> 9485.22]  from
[9485.22 --> 9485.78]  cornering
[9485.78 --> 9485.92]  up
[9485.92 --> 9486.10]  too
[9486.10 --> 9486.40]  much
[9486.40 --> 9486.74]  and
[9486.74 --> 9486.98]  just
[9486.98 --> 9487.28]  kind
[9487.28 --> 9487.56]  of
[9487.56 --> 9488.60]  just
[9488.60 --> 9488.98]  being
[9488.98 --> 9489.30]  an
[9489.30 --> 9489.88]  impenetrable
[9489.88 --> 9490.26]  wall
[9490.26 --> 9490.84]  of bullets
[9490.84 --> 9491.20]  in front
[9491.20 --> 9491.44]  of a
[9491.44 --> 9491.68]  corner
[9491.68 --> 9492.06]  and making
[9492.06 --> 9492.52]  it impossible
[9492.52 --> 9492.86]  to get
[9492.86 --> 9493.10]  at them
[9493.10 --> 9493.40]  at all
[9493.40 --> 9494.54]  um
[9494.54 --> 9496.04]  but
[9496.04 --> 9496.64]  yeah
[9496.64 --> 9496.94]  Left
[9496.94 --> 9497.26]  Left
[9497.26 --> 9497.38]  For
[9497.38 --> 9497.56]  Dead
[9497.56 --> 9497.92]  1
[9497.92 --> 9498.30]  back
[9498.30 --> 9498.46]  to
[9498.46 --> 9498.68]  peak
[9498.68 --> 9498.96]  hype
[9498.96 --> 9499.10]  would
[9499.10 --> 9499.22]  be
[9499.22 --> 9499.70]  amazing
[9499.70 --> 9499.98]  Team
[9499.98 --> 9500.36]  Fortress
[9500.36 --> 9500.64]  2
[9500.64 --> 9501.20]  pre
[9501.20 --> 9502.40]  bullshit
[9502.40 --> 9503.16]  would
[9503.16 --> 9503.46]  also
[9503.46 --> 9503.82]  be
[9503.82 --> 9504.62]  amazing
[9504.62 --> 9505.06]  so
[9505.06 --> 9505.32]  like
[9505.32 --> 9505.52]  no
[9505.52 --> 9505.80]  hats
[9505.80 --> 9505.96]  no
[9505.96 --> 9506.28]  special
[9506.28 --> 9506.74]  weapons
[9506.74 --> 9507.58]  just
[9507.58 --> 9508.90]  balanced
[9508.90 --> 9509.80]  gameplay
[9509.80 --> 9511.12]  um
[9511.12 --> 9512.04]  that I
[9512.04 --> 9512.28]  think
[9512.28 --> 9512.76]  is just
[9512.76 --> 9512.98]  kind
[9512.98 --> 9513.16]  of
[9513.28 --> 9513.62]  missing
[9513.62 --> 9513.96]  in the

[9514.18 --> 9514.48]  version
[9514.48 --> 9514.80]  of it
[9514.80 --> 9516.84]  and it
[9516.84 --> 9517.00]  was
[9517.00 --> 9517.38]  it was
[9517.38 --> 9517.78]  simpler
[9517.78 --> 9518.14]  it's
[9518.14 --> 9518.34]  like
[9518.34 --> 9518.62]  there's
[9518.62 --> 9519.06]  a reason
[9519.06 --> 9519.56]  chess
[9519.56 --> 9520.02]  has
[9520.02 --> 9520.42]  withstood
[9520.42 --> 9520.84]  the test
[9520.84 --> 9521.28]  of time
[9521.28 --> 9522.22]  it's
[9522.22 --> 9523.30]  easy to
[9523.30 --> 9523.62]  learn
[9523.62 --> 9524.22]  impossible
[9524.22 --> 9524.86]  to master
[9524.86 --> 9526.22]  and that's
[9526.22 --> 9526.80]  what I feel
[9526.80 --> 9527.24]  some of
[9527.24 --> 9527.54]  those
[9527.54 --> 9528.08]  earlier
[9528.08 --> 9528.72]  iterations
[9528.72 --> 9529.10]  of
[9529.10 --> 9529.64]  games
[9529.64 --> 9529.86]  that are
[9529.86 --> 9530.34]  still around
[9530.34 --> 9530.64]  today
[9530.64 --> 9530.86]  like
[9530.86 --> 9531.22]  TF2
[9531.22 --> 9531.50]  is still
[9531.50 --> 9531.76]  around
[9531.76 --> 9532.10]  today
[9532.10 --> 9533.14]  but
[9533.14 --> 9534.30]  it was
[9534.30 --> 9535.60]  easy to
[9535.60 --> 9535.74]  learn
[9535.74 --> 9536.20]  impossible
[9536.20 --> 9536.80]  to master
[9536.80 --> 9537.82]  when
[9537.82 --> 9538.82]  every
[9538.82 --> 9539.32]  character
[9539.32 --> 9540.10]  just had
[9540.10 --> 9540.78]  their one
[9540.78 --> 9541.16]  loadout
[9541.16 --> 9541.64]  of weapons
[9541.64 --> 9542.48]  and both
[9542.48 --> 9542.78]  teams
[9543.28 --> 9543.66]  had the
[9543.66 --> 9543.98]  same
[9543.98 --> 9544.40]  roster
[9544.40 --> 9544.62]  of
[9544.62 --> 9544.94]  characters
[9544.94 --> 9545.40]  to choose
[9545.40 --> 9545.62]  from
[9545.62 --> 9546.26]  so it
[9546.26 --> 9546.60]  was all
[9546.60 --> 9547.00]  move
[9547.00 --> 9547.32]  counter
[9547.32 --> 9547.66]  move
[9547.66 --> 9548.20]  whereas now
[9548.20 --> 9548.78]  it's like
[9548.78 --> 9549.80]  I don't know
[9549.80 --> 9550.02]  there's
[9550.02 --> 9551.20]  too many
[9551.20 --> 9551.70]  variables
[9551.70 --> 9552.22]  you can't
[9552.22 --> 9552.74]  balance it
[9552.74 --> 9553.32]  it's impossible
[9553.32 --> 9554.74]  yeah
[9554.74 --> 9556.76]  what's the
[9556.76 --> 9557.78]  Linus method
[9557.78 --> 9558.52]  for cleaning
[9558.52 --> 9559.38]  the desk
[9559.38 --> 9559.84]  pad
[9559.84 --> 9560.42]  keep missing
[9560.42 --> 9560.84]  the deals
[9560.84 --> 9561.28]  on a new
[9561.28 --> 9561.50]  one
[9561.50 --> 9564.30]  the correct
[9564.30 --> 9564.72]  way
[9564.72 --> 9566.16]  the correct
[9566.16 --> 9566.34]  is to
[9566.34 --> 9566.86]  just take
[9566.86 --> 9567.14]  a damp
[9567.14 --> 9567.52]  cloth
[9567.52 --> 9568.26]  and wipe
[9568.26 --> 9568.66]  it down
[9568.66 --> 9570.26]  I have
[9570.26 --> 9570.84]  personally
[9570.84 --> 9571.32]  run them
[9571.32 --> 9571.60]  in the
[9571.60 --> 9572.48]  washing
[9572.48 --> 9572.96]  machine
[9572.96 --> 9574.82]  I have
[9574.82 --> 9575.34]  done okay
[9575.34 --> 9575.82]  with it
[9575.82 --> 9576.78]  customer service
[9576.78 --> 9577.30]  yells at me
[9577.30 --> 9577.84]  every time
[9577.84 --> 9578.56]  I talk about
[9578.56 --> 9579.02]  doing that
[9579.02 --> 9579.20]  though
[9579.20 --> 9579.48]  because
[9579.48 --> 9579.90]  apparently
[9579.90 --> 9580.50]  it's bad
[9580.50 --> 9581.14]  really bad
[9581.14 --> 9581.74]  depending on
[9581.74 --> 9582.10]  your washing
[9582.10 --> 9582.50]  machine
[9582.50 --> 9583.08]  and stuff
[9583.08 --> 9583.52]  so don't
[9583.52 --> 9583.86]  do that
[9583.86 --> 9584.76]  so if you
[9584.76 --> 9585.30]  just use
[9585.30 --> 9586.12]  like a
[9586.12 --> 9586.44]  damp
[9586.44 --> 9587.08]  cloth
[9587.08 --> 9587.40]  and wipe
[9587.40 --> 9587.80]  it down
[9587.80 --> 9588.38]  that's one
[9588.38 --> 9588.70]  thing
[9588.70 --> 9589.64]  that's one
[9589.64 --> 9589.98]  way to do
[9589.98 --> 9590.08]  it
[9590.08 --> 9590.30]  you can
[9590.30 --> 9590.70]  also use
[9590.70 --> 9590.94]  soap
[9590.94 --> 9591.68]  just like
[9591.68 --> 9591.90]  you would
[9591.90 --> 9592.22]  clean a
[9592.22 --> 9592.50]  stain out
[9592.50 --> 9592.68]  of a
[9592.68 --> 9592.88]  carpet
[9592.88 --> 9593.18]  you can
[9593.18 --> 9593.56]  put some
[9593.56 --> 9593.82]  soap
[9593.82 --> 9594.08]  in the
[9594.08 --> 9594.28]  damp
[9594.28 --> 9594.58]  water
[9594.58 --> 9595.36]  I would
[9595.36 --> 9596.02]  test it
[9596.02 --> 9596.26]  in a
[9596.26 --> 9596.56]  corner
[9596.56 --> 9596.88]  where it's
[9596.88 --> 9597.16]  not that
[9597.16 --> 9597.44]  visible
[9597.44 --> 9597.86]  first
[9597.86 --> 9598.28]  before you
[9598.28 --> 9598.58]  use a
[9598.58 --> 9598.78]  cleaning
[9598.78 --> 9599.08]  agent
[9599.08 --> 9599.44]  on it
[9599.44 --> 9599.92]  but just
[9599.92 --> 9600.28]  like dish
[9600.28 --> 9600.48]  soap
[9600.48 --> 9600.88]  should
[9600.88 --> 9601.26]  probably
[9601.26 --> 9601.68]  be fine
[9601.68 --> 9602.66]  and then
[9602.66 --> 9602.84]  rinse
[9602.84 --> 9603.12]  it off
[9603.12 --> 9604.88]  MLB
[9604.88 --> 9605.46]  playoffs
[9605.46 --> 9606.06]  are right
[9606.06 --> 9606.36]  around the
[9606.36 --> 9606.56]  corner
[9606.56 --> 9608.20]  and Canada's
[9608.20 --> 9608.76]  team is
[9608.76 --> 9609.20]  in first
[9609.20 --> 9609.62]  place
[9609.62 --> 9610.58]  will y'all
[9610.58 --> 9611.16]  be following
[9611.16 --> 9611.96]  the Jays
[9611.96 --> 9612.80]  postseason
[9612.80 --> 9613.70]  also go
[9613.70 --> 9614.18]  Astros
[9614.18 --> 9616.86]  baseball
[9616.86 --> 9617.66]  is a sport
[9617.66 --> 9618.28]  that I don't
[9618.28 --> 9618.72]  think I've
[9618.72 --> 9618.96]  followed
[9618.96 --> 9619.62]  since about
[9619.62 --> 9622.56]  1994
[9622.56 --> 9624.88]  so like
[9624.88 --> 9625.24]  all the
[9625.24 --> 9625.58]  baseball
[9625.58 --> 9626.14]  players I
[9626.14 --> 9626.50]  know are
[9626.50 --> 9626.84]  like
[9626.84 --> 9628.48]  Ken
[9628.48 --> 9628.86]  Griffey
[9628.86 --> 9629.16]  Jr.
[9632.06 --> 9632.88]  so I
[9632.88 --> 9633.32]  it would
[9633.32 --> 9633.72]  be really
[9633.72 --> 9634.36]  hard for
[9634.36 --> 9634.68]  me to
[9634.68 --> 9636.28]  jump back
[9636.28 --> 9636.80]  into it
[9636.80 --> 9637.14]  I think
[9637.14 --> 9637.46]  at this
[9637.46 --> 9637.74]  point
[9637.74 --> 9639.88]  good luck
[9639.88 --> 9640.14]  Jays
[9640.14 --> 9640.34]  though
[9640.34 --> 9641.42]  apparently
[9641.42 --> 9641.98]  our
[9641.98 --> 9643.00]  women's
[9643.00 --> 9643.58]  rugby
[9643.58 --> 9643.94]  team
[9643.94 --> 9644.38]  just won
[9644.38 --> 9644.82]  the semis
[9644.82 --> 9645.08]  though
[9645.08 --> 9646.40]  oh let's
[9646.40 --> 9646.62]  go
[9646.62 --> 9646.96]  yeah
[9646.96 --> 9648.48]  hell yeah
[9648.48 --> 9649.70]  well the
[9649.70 --> 9650.12]  last one I
[9650.12 --> 9650.48]  got for you
[9650.48 --> 9651.12]  hey there
[9651.12 --> 9651.92]  my question
[9651.92 --> 9652.28]  to you
[9652.28 --> 9653.28]  is out
[9653.28 --> 9653.66]  of all
[9653.66 --> 9654.08]  the things
[9654.08 --> 9654.38]  you have
[9654.38 --> 9654.88]  publicly
[9654.88 --> 9655.48]  upgraded
[9655.48 --> 9655.84]  throughout
[9655.84 --> 9656.32]  the channel
[9656.32 --> 9657.34]  which one
[9657.34 --> 9657.84]  did you
[9657.84 --> 9658.32]  regret
[9658.32 --> 9659.52]  and which
[9659.52 --> 9659.90]  one did
[9659.90 --> 9660.50]  you absolutely
[9660.50 --> 9660.94]  love
[9660.94 --> 9661.64]  oh I
[9661.64 --> 9662.60]  regretted
[9662.60 --> 9663.38]  upgrading
[9663.38 --> 9664.44]  to the
[9664.44 --> 9665.06]  sets that
[9665.06 --> 9665.52]  we built
[9665.52 --> 9665.90]  in our
[9665.90 --> 9666.34]  warehouse
[9666.34 --> 9666.82]  here when
[9666.82 --> 9667.30]  we first
[9667.30 --> 9667.88]  moved in
[9667.88 --> 9670.40]  sets
[9670.40 --> 9671.00]  it turns
[9671.00 --> 9671.34]  out
[9671.34 --> 9672.50]  were not
[9672.50 --> 9673.90]  warm
[9673.90 --> 9674.48]  huggy
[9674.48 --> 9675.14]  muggy
[9675.14 --> 9677.38]  vibes
[9677.38 --> 9678.02]  the way
[9678.02 --> 9678.44]  that
[9678.44 --> 9679.36]  working
[9679.36 --> 9679.76]  out of
[9679.76 --> 9680.16]  a house
[9680.16 --> 9680.64]  were for
[9680.64 --> 9681.10]  the audience
[9681.10 --> 9681.50]  and they
[9681.50 --> 9681.90]  made that
[9681.90 --> 9682.42]  very
[9682.42 --> 9683.58]  very clear
[9683.58 --> 9684.12]  to us
[9684.12 --> 9685.36]  as for
[9685.36 --> 9685.86]  which one
[9685.86 --> 9686.36]  I absolutely
[9686.36 --> 9686.82]  loved
[9686.82 --> 9687.18]  I'm going
[9687.18 --> 9687.42]  to go
[9687.42 --> 9687.70]  with
[9687.70 --> 9688.12]  air
[9688.12 --> 9688.54]  conditioning
[9688.54 --> 9688.88]  in the
[9688.88 --> 9689.18]  warehouse
[9689.18 --> 9690.86]  it's a
[9690.86 --> 9691.10]  really
[9691.10 --> 9691.56]  expensive
[9691.56 --> 9692.08]  upgrade
[9692.08 --> 9693.20]  both in
[9693.20 --> 9693.54]  terms of
[9693.54 --> 9693.90]  the initial
[9693.90 --> 9694.40]  deployment
[9694.40 --> 9695.44]  and in
[9695.44 --> 9695.74]  terms of
[9695.74 --> 9696.24]  the ongoing
[9696.24 --> 9697.02]  costs to
[9697.02 --> 9697.38]  maintenance
[9697.38 --> 9697.88]  and power
[9697.88 --> 9698.70]  but boy
[9698.70 --> 9699.00]  does it
[9699.00 --> 9699.68]  ever improve
[9699.68 --> 9701.14]  the livability
[9701.14 --> 9701.70]  of our
[9701.70 --> 9702.12]  spaces
[9702.12 --> 9703.62]  I love
[9703.62 --> 9704.26]  air conditioning
[9704.26 --> 9706.50]  that's all
[9706.50 --> 9706.74]  I got
[9706.74 --> 9708.06]  that's it
[9708.06 --> 9708.54]  for today
