Some points of clarification:

When paraphrasing Billet's emails, I should have said it "may" fit. 

I regret the error, but it doesn't change the overall point that Billet Labs provided the block with no expectation that it would be returned and was kept in the loop about our intention to move forward with both installation and publication of the video with the 4090. 

At the end of the day, the conclusion of the video (which was never positioned as a review, but rather a wild project with an unusual water block) was not impacted by performance, but rather by other factors like practicality, compatibility, and cost. 

I also got distracted and didn't post the link to Steve's tweet in the chat. Here it is: https://x.com/GamersNexus/status/1880419893876781227

Additionally, Louis Rossmann asserts that the text message was intentionally sent to Steve's old number as a part of an elaborate gotcha to pull out later on, but the fact is it was a simple matter of accidentally texting the wrong stored number.

It's also worth noting that Steve never actually says he didn't see the text, and admits in his blog post that it's ". . .a number no longer actively monitored by Steve (but still held in storage for security reasons)". Texting the number wouldn't have generated an error or response to indicate it wasn't received, and given I no longer correspond with Steve regularly via text, I've had no reason to check on it.

To be clear, I don't assume any malice on Steve's part in this. His security purposes may not require him to ever install the SIM in a phone - but I flatly reject any accusation that texting the wrong number during a stressful time and not realizing it later is some kind of 4D chess move designed to make him look worse. 

Neither my text message, nor its contents change Steve's conflict of interest in this matter and the clearly intentful misrepresentations that Gamers Nexus made and continues to make. It was simply meant to illustrate that as we've stated publicly, LMG is ready to move on when he is ready to acknowledge his biases and errors, and commit to do better going forward.
