[0.00 → 13.62] What is up L's and G's welcome to the WAN show we've got oh my god such a good show
[13.62 → 21.36] It's actually true such a good I have so much stuff that I'm excited to talk to you guys
[21.36 → 30.16] About the two big ones are of course valve opened the spigot which is a type of valve yeah and
[30.16 → 36.36] Unleashed upon the world if a truly earth-shattering
[36.36 → 45.06] Bit of news for poor Mr. Luke Cafetière who just bought a VR headset that is not
[45.06 → 47.32] We'll talk about the steam frame
[47.32 → 55.22] Also the steam machine the steam controller which we need to talk about the name of
[55.22 → 59.58] Okay, we need to talk about the name of the steam controller in other news
[59.58 → 61.42] Linus was here
[61.42 → 65.28] holy actual shit and
[65.28 → 73.76] And Luke got fucked over on that too so hard literally actually on Luke cafetière's birthday
[73.76 → 81.34] Yeah, Linus came to our studio and Luke couldn't be here for it was a way for it to have been avoided
[81.34 → 88.48] I don't know anything about that. It was not I don't your fault. I don't know anything about looking at you. I don't know anything about that
[88.48 → 89.14] I'm just saying
[89.14 → 92.94] We'll talk about it
[92.94 → 93.82] Talk about it
[93.82 → 103.20] Microsoft wait wait wait hold on it's it's it's the shopping season, and so I'm just gonna I'm going to jump out ahead of things a little bit all right?
[103.20 → 105.80] We'll get you more topics, uh, but first
[105.80 → 108.80] LTT store comm major focus for us this week
[108.80 → 112.16] We've got our buy more save more combo going right now
[112.16 → 117.66] Uh, if you buy the more apparel you buy the more discount you get up to 25% off
[117.66 → 123.94] We have a holiday loot drop going on right now where if you spend a hundred dollars or more
[123.94 → 125.94] You can win a pair of Sennheiser HD
[125.94 → 133.90] Does that that says 550 I thought it was 560s whatever a pair of Sennheiser headphones or if you're really lucky and Asus rogue Xbox ally x
[133.90 → 134.98] and
[134.98 → 137.36] Hey, we've got new products
[137.36 → 144.34] I really like this one including the RGB sweater. Oh my god. We're going to need a closer look at this
[144.34 → 146.76] There you go. You can see the little flex of RGB
[146.76 → 155.44] It's 100 cotton knit with tiny multi-knit yarn flex clean polished look great for the office while the colourful specs keep it fun for holiday hangouts
[155.44 → 159.76] And we have yes, that's right. We finally have beanies again
[159.76 → 164.84] RGB beanies in black and gray in both regular and Linus lengths
[164.84 → 168.56] There you go. See so if you have a deeper head or if you have a shallower head
[168.56 → 173.12] We got you warm cozy and ties right in with the rest of the RGB lineup
[173.12 → 176.50] leg.GG slash RGB. Okay, Luke, you got a couple topics
[176.50 → 180.80] I do first off, uh, Taryn wore that RGB sweater to an event that
[180.80 → 186.04] We both went to, and I thought it looked really sharp and didn't actually realize it was ours until
[186.04 → 187.74] like a
[187.74 → 193.26] Day or two ago. Anyway, Microsoft exec says windows is evolving into an agentic
[193.26 → 196.66] Operating system you picked that and gets it's a week
[196.66 → 202.34] No, the reason why I want to talk about the reason why I want to talk about this is because windows is getting
[202.34 → 203.70] Debunked right now
[203.70 → 206.68] That's what all the intro topics are about
[206.68 → 209.66] It's valve doing Linux stuff and Linux guy
[209.66 → 211.72] You can't call him Linux guy
[211.72 → 215.60] That is why he didn't want to meet you. Oh, wow
[215.60 → 223.88] Speaking of not wanting to meet or something. I don't know. Uh another company that can't stop digging is
[224.68 → 227.14] Ubisoft if I can find the topic about it
[227.14 → 234.42] Uh, they have delayed their half-year earnings report and requested halted trading until its release which is generally
[234.42 → 236.60] a bad sign
[236.60 → 241.68] Oh man
[241.68 → 242.80] Oh man
[242.80 → 245.68] The Linux guy
[245.68 → 249.12] G'n A man
[249.12 → 255.22] How dare you
[255.22 → 258.62] The show is brought to you today by
[258.62 → 259.50] Messi
[259.50 → 260.54] Odom
[260.54 → 266.58] Corsair and odd pieces alongside of course our wrap partner brand our laptop partner del and our chair partner
[266.58 → 268.36] Don't you dare secrete
[268.36 → 272.70] It's upside down, right nice
[272.70 → 277.02] What do we want to do for I mean, it's got to be valved
[277.02 → 279.04] It's got to be valve dude
[279.04 → 281.28] This guy was like
[281.28 → 282.62] Dying
[282.62 → 290.48] Because I saw him the day after the valve event because we were both attending a thing that was farther down the West Coast
[290.48 → 292.56] But for the first
[292.56 → 294.50] Ten hours
[294.50 → 295.04] Yep
[295.04 → 296.38] We were in mixed company
[296.38 → 297.36] So
[297.36 → 299.02] And I knew where he was
[299.02 → 302.90] And I knew the potential level of importance of that
[302.90 → 308.50] But I we didn't even have a private moment for me to tell him what was launched
[308.50 → 310.72] Basically all I was able to tell him was
[310.72 → 314.36] Things we expected also something we didn't expect
[314.36 → 317.78] Yeah, which got me most of the way there but not the whole way there
[317.78 → 319.06] Yeah, so
[319.06 → 320.22] It was
[320.22 → 324.48] When we were finally able to sit down at dinner, and I was able to like to talk him through it
[324.48 → 324.92] He's like
[324.92 → 326.88] Dude
[326.88 → 328.78] This was
[328.78 → 332.76] This was the hardware launch of
[332.76 → 334.34] I mean
[334.34 → 337.38] I feel like this was our Apple Vision Pro
[337.38 → 341.44] What was the Apple Vision Pro is like the the the Norrie people's like whoa interesting
[341.44 → 342.44] This is our
[342.44 → 343.52] Whoa interesting
[343.52 → 344.60] In the VR space
[344.60 → 347.62] But I would actually go back even farther than that
[347.62 → 349.52] This for your IT
[349.52 → 350.96] Computer
[350.96 → 352.00] Gamer
[352.00 → 353.80] Someone who watches the WAN show
[353.80 → 354.08] That
[354.08 → 355.82] That demographic right there
[355.82 → 356.78] Sure
[356.78 → 362.26] This is the most exciting launch since what maybe 30 series
[362.26 → 364.16] RTX 30 series
[364.16 → 365.84] And when I say 30 series
[365.84 → 370.64] I'm not talking the bullshit like pricing that happened afterward with the COVID
[370.64 → 371.38] Silicon
[371.38 → 372.60] All that stuff
[372.60 → 374.46] I'm talking like when it launched
[374.46 → 376.90] You probably remember where you were
[376.90 → 382.22] When you found out that the RTX 3080 was like 500 bucks or 600 bucks or whatever
[382.22 → 387.22] And it was like the performance was huge over the uninspiring 20 series
[387.22 → 388.18] Too bad not real
[388.18 → 389.46] Like what would
[389.46 → 389.80] Yeah
[389.80 → 391.76] But we're talking we're talking the initial news right
[391.76 → 392.04] Yeah
[392.04 → 392.78] Yeah yeah yeah
[392.78 → 394.62] The initial news like can you
[394.62 → 398.12] What else would qualify here
[398.12 → 399.22] Steam Deck was hype
[399.22 → 401.34] That was four years ago now
[401.34 → 403.76] Like it's been a desert dude
[403.76 → 408.16] To me this is more interesting than the initial Steam Deck announcement
[408.16 → 410.10] And that might even sound a little bit surprising
[410.10 → 414.48] But my reason for that is that this actually came with Steam Deck news
[414.48 → 416.44] Kind of as a sidebar thing
[416.44 → 417.64] And this to me
[417.64 → 421.26] You know we got the indication that this might have been a plan
[421.26 → 424.48] Back when they first talked about Steam Machines forever ago
[424.48 → 428.60] But this really shows that they're embracing like Valve hardware as an ecosystem
[428.60 → 431.26] Which is really cool
[431.26 → 432.38] Very exciting
[432.38 → 436.90] It's also super exciting that the Steam Machine is coming Linux based with Steam OS
[436.90 → 442.46] And it's just like the normalization of people using Linux all the time for things
[442.46 → 445.22] Was already pretty big with the Steam Deck
[445.22 → 449.62] But now it also being in a Steam Machine for people that just want a console like experience
[449.62 → 452.10] Because a bunch of people aren't going to care about handhelds and that's cool
[452.10 → 454.48] And a bunch of handheld people won't care about a console experience
[454.48 → 455.16] And that's cool too
[455.16 → 456.08] And that's also cool
[456.08 → 457.40] So now that we have both
[457.40 → 458.32] It's just awesome
[458.32 → 459.02] It's very exciting
[459.02 → 489.02] 
[489.02 → 519.02] 
[519.02 → 549.02] 
[549.02 → 551.86] Like a Quest for instance from Meta
[551.86 → 554.76] It's so light
[554.76 → 556.58] It's so wearable
[556.58 → 557.96] It's so well-balanced
[557.96 → 559.60] Well balanced is surprisingly important
[559.60 → 561.18] With the battery pack at the back
[561.18 → 565.14] It's nice and tight to the face thanks to its pancake lenses
[565.14 → 569.32] That's actually Valve's justification for using LCDs
[569.32 → 574.90] So that they can juice the brightness of the displays enough to overcome the losses from the pancake lenses
[574.90 → 580.16] I've only used it for a few minutes at this point
[580.16 → 583.88] Because I was really busy writing videos and shooting them and stuff while I was in there
[583.88 → 586.92] So I'm going to really need to compare them side by side
[586.92 → 588.16] But if I had to guess
[588.16 → 588.64] Because
[588.64 → 590.74] Yeah
[590.74 → 596.10] So dual radios enable concurrent 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi and 6 gigahertz VR streaming
[596.10 → 597.10] That's what I understood
[597.10 → 598.48] Not what I said from my notes
[598.48 → 599.44] Thank you for looking that up
[599.44 → 600.02] No problem
[600.02 → 603.74] What was I talking about just now?
[604.52 → 604.84] Something
[604.84 → 605.58] Right LCDs
[605.58 → 606.64] So I need to try it
[606.64 → 609.08] I need to try this side by side with the big screen beyond 2
[609.08 → 609.50] Oh yeah yeah
[609.50 → 610.94] Because that's got Olds
[610.94 → 613.36] But it also has a tether
[613.36 → 620.52] So a big part of what Valve is trying to do here is maintain power efficiency for this bloody thing
[620.52 → 620.76] Right?
[621.12 → 626.62] So I've seen a lot of people push back on Valve's justification for using LCDs
[626.62 → 632.04] Saying, well, other VR headsets use pancake lenses and OLED displays
[632.04 → 632.66] And it's like, right
[632.66 → 636.88] But how much power budget are they using to juice these OLED displays?
[636.90 → 637.92] There's also a cost factor
[637.92 → 638.72] To overcome it
[638.72 → 640.26] There's a cost factor too
[640.26 → 644.38] And that was a major concern that I had for the frame
[644.38 → 647.70] Because as soon as I hear it's got a computer on it
[647.70 → 649.14] I go, great
[649.14 → 651.28] A computer I don't care about
[651.28 → 652.96] That now I have to buy
[652.96 → 655.96] But man, is this thing ever cool
[655.96 → 657.92] I might actually care about the computer
[657.92 → 662.00] And that is because of the FEW compatibility layer
[662.00 → 664.36] That Valve has been contributing to
[664.36 → 666.16] In order to speed up the development
[666.16 → 669.38] FEW allows you to run x86 games
[669.38 → 672.30] On the local ARM CPU
[672.30 → 674.34] Which is also running SteamOS
[674.34 → 678.72] These guys have been absolutely cooking over there
[678.72 → 681.30] Of course
[681.30 → 683.86] The most mind-blowing part to me
[683.86 → 687.92] Was when I heard about foveate streaming
[687.92 → 690.22] So a big concern for me
[690.22 → 692.26] As soon as I heard that Project Declared
[692.26 → 694.50] Was going to be a standalone VR headset
[694.50 → 695.46] I was like, fuck
[695.46 → 698.52] Because Valve was the only one that was left
[698.52 → 698.88] Yeah
[698.88 → 700.58] That was doing outside-in
[700.58 → 703.52] Proper freaking tracking
[703.52 → 705.20] That is accurate
[705.20 → 707.20] And like
[707.20 → 709.62] Just fuck
[709.62 → 710.20] Right?
[710.42 → 711.60] With a tether
[711.60 → 713.48] And high visual fidelity
[713.48 → 714.80] You know, everything else
[714.80 → 715.80] Apple Vision Pro
[715.80 → 717.92] Was going to use wireless streaming
[717.92 → 718.70] And the Quest
[718.70 → 720.26] Like you can use a wire
[720.26 → 721.18] It's flaky
[721.18 → 722.52] You can stream wirelessly
[722.52 → 725.02] But it's imperfect at best
[725.02 → 726.80] And so as soon as I found out
[726.80 → 727.40] It was standalone
[727.40 → 728.72] I was like, great
[728.72 → 731.22] There goes the ecosystem
[731.22 → 733.26] For us people who care about
[733.26 → 734.46] Accuracy
[734.46 → 735.74] And
[735.74 → 736.94] Well, yeah
[736.94 → 737.72] Accuracy
[737.72 → 738.48] Low latency
[738.48 → 741.50] I originally fully agreed with you
[741.50 → 742.94] And had the exact same reaction
[742.94 → 743.80] When I heard about Declared
[743.80 → 744.56] But these days
[744.56 → 745.34] With big screen
[745.34 → 746.74] I'm less concerned
[746.74 → 747.84] Because I feel like
[747.84 → 749.18] They can be the champions of that
[749.18 → 750.08] Well, we'll get to that
[750.08 → 750.36] Okay
[750.36 → 750.70] Maybe
[750.70 → 751.24] Okay, okay
[751.24 → 752.04] Maybe not
[752.04 → 752.44] Okay
[752.44 → 753.36] But
[753.36 → 755.04] When Valve
[755.04 → 756.52] Did the demo
[756.52 → 759.34] Showing me their wireless streaming
[759.34 → 761.62] With foveate streaming
[761.62 → 762.36] So
[762.36 → 763.76] If you didn't watch the video
[763.76 → 765.58] What it basically means
[765.58 → 768.88] Is that they are dynamically adjusting
[768.88 → 770.48] Their use
[770.48 → 772.52] Of the bit rate
[772.52 → 773.28] That you have
[773.28 → 773.50] Like
[773.50 → 774.70] Because your connection
[774.70 → 775.56] Your link speed
[775.56 → 777.64] Is only whatever it is
[777.64 → 778.28] Right
[778.28 → 779.28] And so
[779.28 → 781.18] By focusing
[781.18 → 782.42] Their use
[782.42 → 783.72] Of their limited bit rate
[783.72 → 784.34] That they have
[784.34 → 785.12] Because it's not
[785.12 → 786.30] A wired HDMI
[786.30 → 787.56] Or DisplayPort connection
[787.56 → 789.16] On the areas
[789.16 → 790.18] That your eyes
[790.18 → 791.78] Are actually looking at
[791.78 → 793.20] Actually focused on
[793.20 → 795.14] They achieve a level of fidelity
[795.14 → 796.34] That admittedly
[796.34 → 797.48] I wasn't looking at it
[797.48 → 798.28] Side by side
[798.28 → 800.18] But that I could not
[800.18 → 801.16] Discern
[801.16 → 802.38] From a wired connection
[802.38 → 804.50] And
[804.50 → 805.72] I couldn't
[805.72 → 806.34] See
[806.34 → 807.50] The
[807.50 → 807.94] Like
[807.94 → 809.50] I couldn't move my eyes
[809.50 → 810.24] Fast enough
[810.24 → 812.52] We used a shot
[812.52 → 813.16] In the video
[813.16 → 814.14] Of me looking around
[814.14 → 814.68] Like this
[814.68 → 815.44] Which is not
[815.44 → 816.98] How you would try to
[816.98 → 818.04] Beat it
[818.04 → 818.62] Like you would
[818.62 → 820.16] Try to flick your eyes
[820.16 → 821.56] The time it takes
[821.56 → 823.22] For my eyes
[823.22 → 824.26] To move to a new spot
[824.26 → 825.12] And refocus
[825.12 → 826.70] Is slower
[826.70 → 828.16] Than the time it takes
[828.16 → 829.56] For them to track my pupils
[829.56 → 831.24] And reallocate
[831.24 → 832.72] Their streaming bit rate budget
[832.72 → 833.96] And have that be
[833.96 → 834.76] The highest fidelity
[834.76 → 835.46] Part of the scene
[835.46 → 836.06] I couldn't
[836.06 → 836.94] See it Luke
[836.94 → 838.72] Crazy
[838.72 → 839.46] We'll see
[839.46 → 840.54] The proof's going to be
[840.54 → 841.72] In the longer term use
[841.72 → 843.12] I was only able to play
[843.12 → 843.92] Half-Life Alex
[843.92 → 844.72] Which admittedly
[844.72 → 846.12] I didn't enjoy that much
[846.12 → 847.10] I didn't really get through it
[847.10 → 848.12] I didn't mention that to them
[848.12 → 848.30] But
[848.30 → 851.30] The other big one
[851.30 → 852.26] That I was concerned about
[852.26 → 853.28] As someone who
[853.28 → 854.28] Has enjoyed
[854.28 → 855.84] Full body tracking
[855.84 → 856.86] In the past
[856.86 → 857.92] Was
[857.92 → 859.16] Beat Safer
[859.16 → 859.78] So I've
[859.78 → 860.84] I've streamed Beat Safer
[860.84 → 861.64] With ankle
[861.64 → 862.70] And waist trackers
[862.70 → 863.56] In addition to my hand
[863.56 → 864.46] And head trackers
[864.46 → 865.62] And I was
[865.62 → 866.54] Really concerned
[866.54 → 867.38] About both
[867.38 → 868.46] The ability to
[868.46 → 869.32] Move my hands
[869.32 → 870.30] Fast enough
[870.30 → 871.36] Without losing tracking
[871.36 → 872.84] Using camera based tracking
[872.84 → 874.04] So far
[874.04 → 875.26] It looks like
[875.26 → 876.14] They have
[876.14 → 877.76] Invested heavily enough
[877.76 → 878.92] In the onboard processing
[878.92 → 879.72] On the controllers
[879.72 → 881.20] And
[881.20 → 882.88] In quality
[882.88 → 884.46] Quality inside out
[884.46 → 885.28] Tracking cameras
[885.28 → 885.94] And the positioning
[885.94 → 886.46] Is such that
[886.46 → 887.64] You can get pretty far back
[887.64 → 888.56] Before you actually
[888.56 → 889.14] Lose tracking
[889.14 → 889.72] That it looks like
[889.72 → 890.56] That won't be an issue
[890.56 → 891.56] As for whether
[891.56 → 892.76] You can use base stations
[892.76 → 894.20] With your older
[894.20 → 895.40] Tracker devices
[895.40 → 896.70] I've seen quite a few
[896.70 → 897.72] People ask about that
[897.72 → 898.52] I don't know yet
[898.52 → 899.54] But that is going to be
[899.54 → 900.52] One of the first things
[900.52 → 901.52] That I'm going to try
[901.52 → 902.88] Once I have a frame
[902.88 → 904.36] In hand
[904.36 → 905.66] So like
[905.66 → 906.86] This thing is wild
[906.86 → 907.72] It's so
[907.72 → 909.04] It's the versatility
[909.04 → 910.40] The fact that I can get
[910.40 → 911.92] As far as I can tell
[911.92 → 913.86] I wouldn't say
[913.86 → 915.40] Zero compromises
[915.40 → 916.60] Because it isn't an OLED
[916.60 → 919.14] But a low compromise
[919.14 → 921.26] PC VR experience
[921.26 → 922.36] Now
[922.36 → 923.62] With no tether
[923.62 → 924.98] Wow
[924.98 → 927.72] The fact that I can run games
[927.72 → 928.72] Locally
[928.72 → 929.88] On this thing
[929.88 → 930.82] Right
[930.82 → 931.78] Lighter games
[931.78 → 932.50] Obviously
[932.50 → 933.62] VR titles
[933.62 → 934.52] And play those
[934.52 → 935.70] Is wow
[935.70 → 936.80] And then the fact
[936.80 → 937.76] That I can play
[937.76 → 938.90] Everything from
[938.90 → 939.50] Like
[939.50 → 940.66] Literal
[940.66 → 941.04] Like
[941.04 → 942.64] PC games
[942.64 → 943.36] To media
[943.36 → 945.32] On just a giant screen
[945.32 → 946.70] Like I might do
[946.70 → 947.36] With something like
[947.36 → 948.44] An Apple Vision Pro
[948.44 → 949.76] Is
[949.76 → 950.88] Triple wow
[950.88 → 951.46] Like it's
[951.46 → 952.12] It's
[952.12 → 953.26] It's awesome
[953.26 → 954.12] And literally
[954.12 → 955.10] Every criticism
[955.10 → 955.88] That I've seen
[955.88 → 956.58] Of it so far
[956.58 → 958.12] I either
[958.12 → 960.24] Fully understand
[960.24 → 961.24] Why Valve
[961.24 → 961.90] Made the choice
[961.90 → 962.58] That they did
[962.58 → 963.90] And I can
[963.90 → 964.52] And I can
[964.52 → 965.18] I can
[965.18 → 966.34] I can agree
[966.34 → 967.30] With their justification
[967.30 → 968.72] Even if I might have
[968.72 → 969.32] Done it differently
[969.32 → 971.20] Or I think the criticism
[971.20 → 972.68] Is just frankly stupid
[972.68 → 974.78] Like man
[974.78 → 977.44] I don't understand
[977.44 → 978.46] How in the year
[978.46 → 979.34] And I'm about to
[979.34 → 980.24] Offend some people
[980.24 → 980.64] I think
[980.64 → 982.02] But I don't understand
[982.02 → 982.76] How in the year
[982.76 → 983.42] 2025
[983.42 → 984.82] You can somehow
[984.82 → 985.74] Not be aware
[985.74 → 986.58] Of nickel metal
[986.58 → 987.26] Hydride
[987.26 → 988.52] Double A cells
[988.52 → 989.96] Oh I
[989.96 → 991.48] I can definitely
[991.48 → 992.00] Imagine
[992.00 → 992.74] How
[992.74 → 993.84] How
[993.84 → 997.90] How would most people
[997.90 → 999.18] Outside this
[999.18 → 1000.38] This group
[1000.38 → 1001.42] That's watching this
[1001.42 → 1002.60] Or other similar content
[1002.60 → 1003.76] Have run into that
[1003.76 → 1004.74] Because
[1004.74 → 1006.82] Disposable batteries
[1006.82 → 1007.36] Are so
[1007.36 → 1008.62] F***ING expensive
[1008.62 → 1009.52] You'd think they'd
[1009.52 → 1010.56] Look for an alternative
[1010.56 → 1011.54] I don't think
[1011.54 → 1012.22] A lot of people
[1012.22 → 1012.80] Run into
[1012.80 → 1013.96] Disposable batteries
[1013.96 → 1014.74] In their
[1014.74 → 1015.62] Day to day
[1015.62 → 1016.06] Dude
[1016.06 → 1017.60] You have been to a Costco
[1017.60 → 1018.02] Lately
[1018.02 → 1019.28] You see how big
[1019.28 → 1020.00] The pallets
[1020.00 → 1020.92] Of disposable batteries
[1020.92 → 1021.08] Are
[1021.08 → 1021.78] People are buying
[1021.78 → 1022.48] The crap out of
[1022.48 → 1022.90] These things
[1022.90 → 1023.74] And all they had
[1023.74 → 1024.16] To do
[1024.16 → 1025.44] Is go buy like
[1025.44 → 1026.36] Eight N loops
[1026.36 → 1027.34] And a charger
[1027.34 → 1028.28] And then never
[1028.28 → 1028.98] Buy one again
[1028.98 → 1030.70] Are grabbing the ones
[1030.70 → 1031.76] At Costco
[1031.76 → 1033.06] Or grabbing the pack
[1033.06 → 1034.08] From like Ikea
[1034.08 → 1034.98] And just not thinking
[1034.98 → 1035.66] About it ever
[1035.66 → 1037.00] Because they throw it
[1037.00 → 1037.66] In their TV remote
[1037.66 → 1038.16] And then it lasts
[1038.16 → 1038.90] For like two years
[1038.90 → 1039.74] Or longer
[1039.74 → 1040.66] But
[1040.66 → 1041.96] Double A's go in
[1041.96 → 1043.20] All kinds of things
[1043.20 → 1046.76] Kids toys
[1046.76 → 1048.48] Xbox controllers
[1048.48 → 1048.66] Not kids toys
[1048.66 → 1050.84] Adult toys
[1050.84 → 1051.62] Yeah
[1051.62 → 1052.66] Exactly
[1052.66 → 1054.88] Get
[1054.88 → 1056.50] Maybe people just
[1056.50 → 1057.28] Aren't being super
[1057.28 → 1058.16] Economical about
[1058.16 → 1059.02] Their adults toys
[1059.02 → 1059.98] It's just
[1059.98 → 1060.88] Use them less
[1060.88 → 1062.56] Dude it's wild to me
[1062.56 → 1063.42] Like you can
[1063.42 → 1063.74] Yeah
[1063.74 → 1065.06] Okay so one person
[1065.06 → 1066.08] One person here says
[1066.08 → 1066.92] Yeah the disposables
[1066.92 → 1068.00] Last longer in the device
[1068.00 → 1069.14] Like my god
[1069.14 → 1069.82] Who cares
[1069.82 → 1071.50] Yes it's a little bit longer
[1071.50 → 1073.38] But literally
[1073.38 → 1074.84] If you factor in the time
[1074.84 → 1076.22] To walk down the aisle
[1076.22 → 1077.40] And go get the stupid
[1077.40 → 1078.08] Batteries
[1078.08 → 1078.60] You've already
[1078.60 → 1079.48] Accounted for
[1079.48 → 1080.26] The extra time
[1080.26 → 1080.82] That you'll use
[1080.82 → 1081.98] Changing the batteries
[1081.98 → 1083.08] Slightly more often
[1083.08 → 1084.18] Like it really
[1084.18 → 1085.98] Is not that big of a deal
[1085.98 → 1087.30] Especially in low usage
[1087.30 → 1087.72] Devices
[1087.72 → 1088.22] I think just won't do all that care man
[1088.22 → 1090.22] But they're so expensive
[1090.22 → 1092.06] Buy one
[1092.06 → 1092.36] Dude
[1092.36 → 1093.10] I have
[1093.10 → 1094.04] Envelops in my house
[1094.04 → 1095.34] That I've had for ten years
[1095.34 → 1095.76] Oh yeah
[1095.76 → 1096.60] That have been
[1096.60 → 1097.30] Probably longer
[1097.30 → 1099.32] Probably 50 recharge cycles
[1099.32 → 1100.70] They still work
[1100.70 → 1103.02] Like can people just not
[1103.02 → 1103.68] Throw
[1103.68 → 1105.34] Literally throw away money
[1105.34 → 1107.76] Like this is for your own good
[1107.76 → 1111.20] Go buy some nickel metal hydride batteries
[1111.20 → 1113.76] What?
[1114.98 → 1116.38] Why is this funny?
[1117.26 → 1117.74] It's just
[1117.74 → 1118.76] That whole sentence
[1118.76 → 1121.06] Go buy some nickel batteries
[1121.06 → 1122.64] It's just such a funny sentence
[1122.64 → 1123.48] We don't even offer them
[1123.48 → 1124.20] Not from us
[1124.20 → 1125.22] Just buy it from someone
[1125.22 → 1126.12] It's just hilarious
[1126.12 → 1126.66] I'm sorry
[1126.66 → 1130.32] Twitch chat's going to lose
[1130.32 → 1131.46] I don't disagree with you
[1131.46 → 1132.48] Twitch is going to lose
[1132.48 → 1133.22] Their chat privileges
[1133.22 → 1134.00] Pretty quick here
[1134.00 → 1134.72] Curacao will never
[1134.72 → 1135.60] Sponsor us again
[1135.60 → 1136.48] I don't even disagree with you
[1136.48 → 1137.08] Linus do you know
[1137.08 → 1137.92] What's expensive?
[1138.28 → 1139.06] Rechargeable batteries
[1139.06 → 1140.18] Yeah one time
[1140.18 → 1142.46] One time
[1142.46 → 1143.04] Buy once
[1143.04 → 1143.68] Cry once
[1143.68 → 1144.24] Yes
[1144.24 → 1146.22] You can recharge it
[1146.22 → 1147.32] Like 50 times
[1147.32 → 1148.72] A hundred times
[1148.72 → 1149.90] Do they cost
[1149.90 → 1151.12] 50 times as much?
[1152.44 → 1153.32] I'll let you do the
[1153.32 → 1153.78] Actually no
[1153.78 → 1154.52] I'm not going to let you
[1154.52 → 1154.90] Do the math
[1154.90 → 1155.56] Because you're a
[1155.56 → 1156.24] F***ING idiot
[1156.24 → 1157.56] No
[1157.56 → 1158.42] They don't
[1158.42 → 1159.90] Cost 50 times as much
[1159.90 → 1162.22] Go buy rechargeable batteries
[1162.22 → 1164.02] You can thank me later
[1164.02 → 1165.80] We're losing
[1165.80 → 1166.38] Elijah
[1166.38 → 1169.74] That's so mad
[1169.74 → 1172.22] First time
[1172.22 → 1174.62] Dying here man
[1174.62 → 1175.02] I mean I generally
[1175.02 → 1176.10] Pretty much agree with all that
[1176.10 → 1177.14] The only thing I don't agree with
[1177.14 → 1177.54] Is like
[1177.54 → 1179.22] How do people not realize it
[1179.22 → 1180.22] Like I mean
[1180.22 → 1181.02] It's pretty obvious
[1181.02 → 1185.34] Consumers man
[1185.34 → 1185.84] Linus
[1185.84 → 1187.14] At the stores
[1187.14 → 1187.94] They're shopping at
[1187.94 → 1188.56] In a lot of cases
[1188.56 → 1189.50] They're just not there
[1189.50 → 1190.60] Linus just forgets
[1190.60 → 1191.64] That he's the smartest person
[1191.64 → 1192.52] In the room at all times
[1192.52 → 1192.86] So
[1192.86 → 1194.90] He's just so overwhelmingly intelligent
[1194.90 → 1195.80] That's the problem
[1195.80 → 1196.86] I'm not that smart
[1196.86 → 1200.36] I hate being the smartest person
[1200.36 → 1200.80] In a room
[1200.80 → 1201.68] It's a really hard time
[1201.68 → 1202.28] Buying helmets
[1202.28 → 1203.30] Have you tried huffing
[1203.30 → 1204.48] Paint more often?
[1205.16 → 1206.66] That sounds like a good hobby
[1206.66 → 1207.74] For someone like you
[1207.74 → 1208.86] Good Friday night
[1208.86 → 1211.32] I know what I'm doing
[1211.32 → 1212.02] After the show
[1212.02 → 1213.18] To deal with Twitch chat
[1213.18 → 1214.02] I'm dying guys
[1214.02 → 1215.56] Now to be clear
[1215.56 → 1216.76] To be clear
[1216.76 → 1217.48] To be clear
[1217.48 → 1219.12] There are situations
[1219.12 → 1219.88] Where an alkaline
[1219.88 → 1220.62] Makes more sense
[1220.62 → 1221.72] So for
[1221.72 → 1223.02] Like I keep alkaline
[1223.02 → 1223.80] In my house as well
[1223.80 → 1225.28] So for instance
[1225.28 → 1230.46] For instance
[1230.46 → 1231.66] Oh my god
[1231.66 → 1233.04] This is going all over Reddit
[1233.04 → 1234.50] Low end kids toys
[1234.50 → 1235.72] I will tip
[1235.72 → 1236.14] I'll tip
[1236.14 → 1237.46] Can
[1237.46 → 1238.00] Can I
[1238.00 → 1238.92] Can I talk
[1238.92 → 1240.42] I feel like you
[1240.42 → 1242.64] Can I just talk
[1242.64 → 1243.64] Without being interrupted
[1243.64 → 1245.42] I'm not even saying anything
[1245.42 → 1247.54] Your judgment
[1247.54 → 1248.92] Speaks very loudly
[1248.92 → 1252.00] I can't believe
[1252.00 → 1252.88] You would give a horrible
[1252.88 → 1253.94] Experience to your children
[1253.94 → 1254.44] It's not
[1254.44 → 1256.58] Ruining the next generation
[1256.58 → 1257.90] So for low end kids toys
[1257.90 → 1258.56] Where I think
[1258.56 → 1259.52] It's very likely
[1259.52 → 1260.60] That we're going to end up
[1260.60 → 1261.54] Like donating it
[1261.54 → 1262.82] Before it would even
[1262.82 → 1263.90] Run through an entire
[1263.90 → 1264.64] Battery cycle
[1264.64 → 1265.62] I don't want to risk
[1265.62 → 1266.48] Losing my expensive
[1266.48 → 1267.72] Rechargeable batteries
[1267.72 → 1269.16] So there are situations
[1269.16 → 1270.32] Where I'll throw an alkaline
[1270.32 → 1270.98] Into something
[1270.98 → 1272.26] Because I'm just like
[1272.26 → 1272.60] Yeah
[1272.60 → 1274.32] This is very likely
[1274.32 → 1275.08] To be lost
[1275.08 → 1276.00] Because like
[1276.00 → 1277.32] For certain toys
[1277.32 → 1278.54] It literally will double
[1278.54 → 1280.18] Like the value of that thing
[1280.18 → 1280.86] If you put a couple
[1280.86 → 1282.08] Rechargeable batteries in it
[1282.08 → 1282.68] Like I'd not
[1282.68 → 1283.44] Not forget it
[1283.44 → 1284.08] I'll throw an alkaline
[1284.08 → 1284.42] In there
[1284.42 → 1285.00] But
[1285.00 → 1286.90] And there are devices
[1286.90 → 1288.46] Particularly like
[1288.46 → 1289.64] Super high draw ones
[1289.64 → 1291.08] That actually don't run
[1291.08 → 1292.24] Properly on rechargeable
[1292.24 → 1293.72] There are devices
[1293.72 → 1295.66] That don't respond well
[1295.66 → 1297.02] To the lower voltage range
[1297.02 → 1298.20] Of rechargeable batteries
[1298.20 → 1300.20] Sorry
[1300.20 → 1301.48] Not you
[1301.48 → 1304.44] You're going to lose
[1304.44 → 1305.24] Your chat privileges
[1305.24 → 1306.54] You're going to lose
[1306.54 → 1307.42] Your chat privileges
[1307.42 → 1309.68] You're going to lose
[1309.68 → 1310.82] Your chat privileges
[1310.82 → 1311.56] All of you
[1311.56 → 1312.94] I have to moderate
[1312.94 → 1315.94] I have to read them
[1315.94 → 1318.20] Now you're stuck
[1318.20 → 1318.86] With them too
[1318.86 → 1319.88] This is what it's like
[1319.88 → 1320.60] Every Friday
[1320.60 → 1321.32] Slow the cards are hilarious
[1321.32 → 1322.80] There are also a lot of names
[1322.80 → 1323.40] From Flow plane
[1323.40 → 1324.08] That are hanging out
[1324.08 → 1325.40] Yeah
[1325.40 → 1325.88] Sorry about the chat
[1325.88 → 1327.38] I reduced slow mode as well
[1327.38 → 1328.32] Just to make it worse
[1328.32 → 1329.26] On everyone
[1329.26 → 1329.96] Okay
[1329.96 → 1330.42] Look
[1330.42 → 1330.72] Nice
[1330.72 → 1331.52] The point is
[1331.52 → 1333.08] Oh
[1333.08 → 1333.82] Flowing chat is back
[1333.82 → 1335.20] That one of the
[1335.20 → 1336.18] Biggest criticisms
[1336.18 → 1338.56] I'm coming back on topic here
[1338.56 → 1339.24] One of the
[1339.24 → 1340.46] Oh cool
[1340.46 → 1341.82] You know what
[1341.82 → 1343.18] Twitch chat hasn't lost
[1343.18 → 1344.10] Their privileges yet
[1344.10 → 1346.64] They can keep it for now
[1346.64 → 1349.50] The problem is
[1349.50 → 1350.06] Sorry
[1350.06 → 1351.20] The biggest complaint
[1351.20 → 1351.90] That I've seen
[1351.90 → 1352.70] About the frame
[1352.70 → 1354.00] Is the AA battery
[1354.00 → 1354.78] In the controllers
[1354.78 → 1356.48] And that
[1356.48 → 1357.86] Was pretty wild to me
[1357.86 → 1358.76] Especially as someone
[1358.76 → 1360.22] Who has knuckles controllers
[1360.22 → 1361.10] And an index
[1361.10 → 1362.64] And has experienced
[1362.64 → 1363.64] Forgetting to charge
[1363.64 → 1365.06] The integrated lithium battery
[1365.06 → 1366.52] And then had to like
[1366.52 → 1368.08] Charge for 10 minutes
[1368.08 → 1369.42] Play for 15 minutes
[1369.42 → 1370.24] Charge for 10 minutes
[1370.24 → 1371.14] Play for 15 minutes
[1371.14 → 1371.88] Like that is not
[1371.88 → 1372.64] A better experience
[1372.64 → 1373.34] Than just
[1373.34 → 1374.78] Having a little
[1374.78 → 1376.26] Quad cell charger
[1376.26 → 1377.56] Somewhere near your VR headset
[1377.56 → 1379.10] And then just
[1379.10 → 1380.30] Popping your dead battery
[1380.30 → 1380.88] Into it
[1380.88 → 1382.46] Grabbing a freshly charged one
[1382.46 → 1383.52] Popping it into the controller
[1383.52 → 1384.46] And then being ready to go
[1384.46 → 1385.20] For another full
[1385.20 → 1385.98] Charge cycle
[1385.98 → 1387.40] It is
[1387.40 → 1387.94] It is
[1387.94 → 1389.56] Actually
[1389.56 → 1390.60] Objectively
[1390.60 → 1392.40] Faster to get back up
[1392.40 → 1392.78] And running
[1392.78 → 1393.66] And
[1393.66 → 1394.62] The weight
[1394.62 → 1395.78] Of an AA cell
[1395.78 → 1396.06] Yeah
[1396.06 → 1396.88] I can see people
[1396.88 → 1397.96] Not being that into it
[1397.96 → 1399.70] Because they have to have
[1399.70 → 1400.76] Like a big metal housing
[1400.76 → 1401.28] Around them
[1401.28 → 1402.02] Compared to
[1402.02 → 1403.00] Like a
[1403.00 → 1404.08] Compared to just like
[1404.08 → 1404.92] A pack style
[1404.92 → 1405.74] Lithium battery
[1405.74 → 1407.92] Excuse me
[1407.92 → 1408.54] Pouch style
[1408.54 → 1409.00] Was the word
[1409.00 → 1409.80] I was looking for
[1409.80 → 1411.12] Yeah
[1411.12 → 1411.62] I don't love
[1411.62 → 1412.50] Having the extra weight
[1412.50 → 1413.54] But for the convenience
[1413.54 → 1414.18] Of being able to
[1414.18 → 1415.20] Quickly swap a battery
[1415.20 → 1416.10] I think it is
[1416.10 → 1417.48] Well worth it
[1417.48 → 1418.34] And it is
[1418.34 → 1419.06] I mean
[1419.06 → 1419.78] Let's face it
[1419.78 → 1420.62] This thing is not
[1420.62 → 1421.26] Going to be cheap
[1421.26 → 1422.54] Is there a
[1422.54 → 1423.48] Price out there
[1423.48 → 1424.62] Is there a price out there
[1424.62 → 1425.50] On any of this
[1425.50 → 1426.16] No
[1426.16 → 1428.30] But Valve did
[1428.30 → 1429.88] Make some nudges
[1429.88 → 1430.58] Some indications
[1430.58 → 1431.20] Yeah
[1431.20 → 1433.32] They did indicate
[1433.32 → 1435.46] Sort of what they were targeting
[1435.46 → 1436.44] And I think the goal
[1436.44 → 1437.36] Was for it to be
[1437.36 → 1438.60] Not more expensive
[1438.60 → 1439.38] Than Index
[1439.38 → 1441.28] So the headset
[1441.28 → 1441.90] Itself
[1441.90 → 1444.06] Is loaded up
[1444.06 → 1444.76] To the gills
[1444.76 → 1446.22] With expensive tech
[1446.22 → 1447.66] But you don't need
[1447.66 → 1448.32] Base stations
[1448.32 → 1449.54] So that
[1449.54 → 1450.32] Helps
[1450.32 → 1451.06] I guess
[1451.06 → 1452.10] And then we'll see
[1452.10 → 1452.92] Where the chips fall
[1452.92 → 1453.64] In terms of pricing
[1453.64 → 1454.72] But I wouldn't be surprised
[1454.72 → 1455.22] To see
[1455.22 → 1456.28] $9.99
[1456.28 → 1457.30] I wouldn't be surprised
[1457.30 → 1458.26] To see the same price
[1458.26 → 1459.50] As an index
[1459.50 → 1461.74] Or rather
[1461.74 → 1462.48] Shoot
[1462.48 → 1463.12] What's the index
[1463.12 → 1463.62] What's the index
[1463.62 → 1464.44] Go for in the states
[1464.44 → 1466.14] Index price
[1466.14 → 1466.90] In USD
[1466.90 → 1468.80] Oh shoot
[1468.80 → 1469.08] Yeah
[1469.08 → 1469.58] You have to say
[1469.58 → 1470.20] Valve index
[1470.20 → 1470.86] Otherwise you just
[1470.86 → 1471.62] End up with all kinds
[1471.62 → 1472.18] Of other things
[1472.18 → 1473.16] $9.99
[1473.16 → 1473.68] $9.99
[1473.68 → 1474.02] Okay
[1474.02 → 1474.58] For the kit
[1474.58 → 1475.52] I did get that right
[1475.52 → 1475.90] Okay
[1475.90 → 1477.52] But I mean
[1477.52 → 1477.78] Essentially
[1477.78 → 1478.52] Just the headset
[1478.52 → 1479.76] Is $6.59
[1479.76 → 1480.56] But you're not
[1480.56 → 1480.84] Going to be able
[1480.84 → 1481.34] To buy this
[1481.34 → 1482.14] Without the kit
[1482.14 → 1482.56] So
[1482.56 → 1483.12] The headset
[1483.12 → 1483.70] And controllers
[1483.70 → 1484.16] Is
[1484.16 → 1485.04] Oh wait
[1485.04 → 1485.82] What
[1485.82 → 1489.46] Oh
[1489.46 → 1490.80] What's that
[1490.80 → 1491.28] If you want
[1491.28 → 1492.32] The whole thing
[1492.32 → 1492.88] So headset
[1492.88 → 1493.40] Controllers
[1493.40 → 1494.10] Base stations
[1494.10 → 1495.64] All that
[1495.64 → 1496.64] It's
[1496.64 → 1498.14] $13.19
[1498.14 → 1498.72] Oh
[1498.72 → 1499.08] Canadian
[1499.08 → 1499.44] Yeah
[1499.44 → 1499.72] Canadian
[1499.72 → 1500.22] So that's
[1500.22 → 1500.86] That's a grand
[1500.86 → 1501.18] Yeah
[1501.18 → 1501.74] Okay
[1501.74 → 1503.68] Alright
[1503.68 → 1506.72] What are we even
[1506.72 → 1507.34] Oh yeah
[1507.34 → 1507.58] Wow
[1507.58 → 1508.18] We're still talking
[1508.18 → 1508.72] About the valve
[1508.72 → 1509.28] Announcements
[1509.28 → 1510.02] Sure are
[1510.02 → 1510.24] Yeah
[1510.24 → 1510.90] Elijah's never
[1510.90 → 1511.42] Going home
[1511.42 → 1511.92] He's actually
[1511.92 → 1512.46] Here to talk
[1512.46 → 1513.14] About the other
[1513.14 → 1513.62] Big news
[1513.62 → 1514.26] From this week
[1514.26 → 1515.28] Sure is
[1515.28 → 1516.00] Linus X
[1516.00 → 1516.56] Linus
[1516.56 → 1517.50] Um
[1517.50 → 1519.90] But I mean
[1519.90 → 1520.60] We can't move on
[1520.60 → 1521.14] From the frame
[1521.14 → 1521.76] Without talking
[1521.76 → 1522.86] About how much
[1522.86 → 1523.78] Buyer's remorse
[1523.78 → 1524.38] You must be
[1524.38 → 1525.22] Feeling right now
[1525.22 → 1525.96] I don't know
[1525.96 → 1527.76] So he just
[1527.76 → 1528.36] I don't know
[1528.36 → 1529.36] Like two months ago
[1529.36 → 1530.90] Bought a big screen
[1530.90 → 1531.64] Beyond 2
[1531.64 → 1532.66] Oh I bought it
[1532.66 → 1533.10] Before then
[1533.10 → 1534.14] I just received it
[1534.14 → 1534.82] Somewhere around there
[1534.82 → 1535.92] Have you fired it up yet
[1535.92 → 1536.92] No I still don't have
[1536.92 → 1537.52] A functional
[1537.52 → 1539.34] Uh dwelling
[1539.34 → 1541.14] So by the time
[1541.14 → 1542.18] You actually get to
[1542.18 → 1543.20] Use your big screen
[1543.20 → 1543.90] Beyond 2
[1543.90 → 1544.78] It might be
[1544.78 → 1545.32] Uh
[1545.32 → 1546.30] Halfway through
[1546.30 → 1546.96] 2026
[1546.96 → 1547.38] We'll see
[1547.38 → 1547.96] The frame
[1547.96 → 1548.26] What
[1548.26 → 1549.02] I'm kidding
[1549.02 → 1549.74] Oh okay
[1549.74 → 1550.32] The frame
[1550.32 → 1551.54] The frame
[1551.54 → 1552.72] Could literally be
[1552.72 → 1553.80] Like imminently
[1553.80 → 1554.42] Available
[1554.42 → 1555.68] Oh yeah
[1555.68 → 1556.36] How do you feel
[1556.36 → 1557.14] About that sir
[1557.14 → 1557.96] I don't know
[1557.96 → 1559.88] That is such a
[1559.88 → 1560.10] That
[1560.10 → 1561.34] This is a podcast
[1561.34 → 1561.82] The big screen
[1561.82 → 1562.40] Beyond is still
[1562.40 → 1563.18] Really cool
[1563.18 → 1563.86] You can't just say
[1563.86 → 1564.54] I don't know
[1564.54 → 1565.08] The big screen
[1565.08 → 1565.56] Beyond is still
[1565.56 → 1566.06] Really cool
[1566.06 → 1567.32] I don't know
[1567.32 → 1567.92] How much regret
[1567.92 → 1568.62] I'm going to feel
[1568.62 → 1569.90] I feel like
[1569.90 → 1570.70] I actually might
[1570.70 → 1571.28] End up with
[1571.28 → 1571.90] Both of them
[1571.90 → 1572.52] Which might sound
[1572.52 → 1572.92] Insane
[1572.92 → 1575.04] Oh I was
[1575.04 → 1575.54] I was gonna
[1575.54 → 1576.38] I was about
[1576.38 → 1577.02] To make a joke
[1577.02 → 1577.48] About how
[1577.48 → 1578.14] The regret
[1578.14 → 1578.44] Could be
[1578.44 → 1578.70] Kind of
[1578.70 → 1579.32] Tugging on you
[1579.32 → 1579.84] A little bit
[1579.84 → 1580.16] Something
[1580.16 → 1582.24] Because honestly
[1582.24 → 1582.70] That's
[1582.70 → 1583.28] I think that's
[1583.28 → 1584.06] The biggest downside
[1584.06 → 1585.54] There are still
[1585.54 → 1586.46] Advantages
[1586.46 → 1587.60] To the Beyond 2
[1587.60 → 1589.22] OLED displays
[1589.22 → 1589.60] Yes
[1589.60 → 1590.60] It is
[1590.60 → 1591.28] Smaller
[1591.28 → 1592.12] And lighter
[1592.12 → 1592.54] Yep
[1592.54 → 1593.76] Better light seal
[1593.76 → 1595.68] Because it's bespoke
[1595.68 → 1596.56] The light seal is
[1596.56 → 1597.80] Incredible
[1597.80 → 1598.68] Literally perfect
[1598.68 → 1599.08] Yeah
[1599.08 → 1600.14] Literally perfect
[1600.14 → 1601.56] Very comfortable
[1601.56 → 1602.04] As well
[1602.04 → 1603.98] Yeah
[1603.98 → 1604.74] I don't know
[1604.74 → 1605.24] If it's as good
[1605.24 → 1605.52] As the
[1605.52 → 1606.02] Oh
[1606.02 → 1606.80] Yeah
[1606.80 → 1607.68] Tough
[1607.68 → 1608.94] Depends on how long
[1608.94 → 1609.52] You're wearing it
[1609.52 → 1610.22] Have you actually
[1610.22 → 1611.12] Worn it for like
[1611.12 → 1612.08] Doing anything physical
[1612.08 → 1612.68] No
[1612.68 → 1613.46] So the Beyond
[1613.46 → 1614.48] Because it has
[1614.48 → 1615.52] It has like a
[1615.52 → 1616.76] Rubbery type of
[1616.76 → 1617.12] Material
[1617.12 → 1617.70] Like a silicone
[1617.70 → 1618.68] It's still literally
[1618.68 → 1619.24] Here
[1619.24 → 1619.54] Yeah
[1619.54 → 1620.34] In a box
[1620.34 → 1620.98] On my desk
[1620.98 → 1621.62] I'm so sorry
[1621.62 → 1622.94] Because it uses
[1622.94 → 1623.64] That material
[1623.64 → 1624.40] You end up with
[1624.40 → 1624.92] What I call
[1624.92 → 1625.64] Swamp eye
[1625.64 → 1626.82] A little bit
[1626.82 → 1627.52] Because it's not
[1627.52 → 1628.16] Breathable
[1628.16 → 1628.48] Yeah
[1628.48 → 1628.70] Yeah
[1628.70 → 1628.88] Yeah
[1628.88 → 1629.06] Yeah
[1629.06 → 1630.42] Whereas the deck
[1630.42 → 1631.32] Uses a more
[1631.32 → 1632.36] A more breathable
[1632.36 → 1633.02] Style material
[1633.02 → 1633.82] And it has like
[1633.82 → 1634.26] Gaps
[1634.26 → 1635.52] Like you can kind of
[1635.52 → 1636.38] You know
[1636.38 → 1636.84] You can kind of
[1636.84 → 1637.58] Look down and see
[1637.58 → 1638.16] Where you're going
[1638.16 → 1639.06] With the
[1639.06 → 1639.74] With the deck
[1639.74 → 1640.28] Not that you like
[1640.28 → 1640.52] Should
[1640.52 → 1641.12] You should just use
[1641.12 → 1641.86] The pass through cameras
[1641.86 → 1642.28] Obviously
[1642.28 → 1643.44] But you can
[1643.44 → 1644.42] Hot take
[1644.42 → 1645.20] Black and white
[1645.20 → 1645.92] Totally fine
[1645.92 → 1647.22] Oh I don't even care
[1647.22 → 1647.68] Who cares
[1647.68 → 1648.22] Dude I
[1648.22 → 1648.92] Oh man
[1648.92 → 1650.48] I had someone
[1650.48 → 1651.26] Like come at me
[1651.26 → 1651.94] In the comments
[1651.94 → 1652.72] Because I
[1652.72 → 1654.08] Because I criticized it
[1654.08 → 1654.72] For not being able
[1654.72 → 1655.48] To walk around
[1655.48 → 1656.34] With the camera
[1656.34 → 1656.88] Pass through
[1656.88 → 1657.48] And I was like
[1657.48 → 1657.82] Bro
[1657.82 → 1659.70] I'm joking
[1659.70 → 1660.36] Yeah
[1660.36 → 1661.36] I was taking a shot
[1661.36 → 1662.92] At Apple Vision Pro people
[1662.92 → 1663.86] Who were walking around
[1663.86 → 1664.56] With their stupid
[1664.56 → 1665.24] Headsets on
[1665.24 → 1666.18] For the first couple weeks
[1666.18 → 1667.00] Yeah
[1667.00 → 1667.54] I was like
[1667.54 → 1667.94] Oh yeah
[1667.94 → 1669.00] I don't even know
[1669.00 → 1669.74] If it was a couple of weeks
[1669.74 → 1670.22] Yeah
[1670.22 → 1671.10] A week
[1671.10 → 1672.46] First few days
[1672.46 → 1673.74] And that stopped
[1673.74 → 1674.38] Pretty quick
[1674.38 → 1674.72] Yeah
[1674.72 → 1677.30] Yeah I don't really care
[1677.30 → 1678.30] About the black and white cameras
[1678.30 → 1679.28] This to me
[1679.28 → 1680.72] Feels like I have
[1680.72 → 1683.00] A seated or near
[1683.00 → 1684.34] Computer experience
[1684.34 → 1685.22] Which is like
[1685.22 → 1686.58] Really
[1686.58 → 1689.02] Dialled
[1689.02 → 1689.88] But
[1689.88 → 1692.32] Might kind of take
[1692.32 → 1693.42] Some setup time
[1693.42 → 1695.82] Move things out of the way
[1695.82 → 1696.62] Do stuff like that
[1696.62 → 1697.08] And then like
[1697.08 → 1697.82] Really settle into
[1697.82 → 1698.66] Like this nice
[1698.66 → 1699.60] Dialled
[1699.60 → 1700.54] Tethered experience
[1700.54 → 1702.00] And then the frame
[1702.00 → 1703.36] The frame's
[1703.36 → 1704.68] Interesting for a bunch
[1704.68 → 1705.40] Of reasons to me
[1705.40 → 1706.26] I almost want like
[1706.26 → 1707.52] A travel box for it
[1707.52 → 1710.00] I would use the crap
[1710.00 → 1710.54] Out of the frame
[1710.54 → 1711.02] On the road
[1711.02 → 1711.38] Yeah
[1711.38 → 1712.30] Being able to like
[1712.30 → 1713.86] Play some Beat Safer
[1713.86 → 1714.72] Oh yeah
[1714.72 → 1715.62] And like
[1715.62 → 1716.14] Just anywhere
[1716.14 → 1716.84] Because
[1716.84 → 1717.76] I actually
[1717.76 → 1718.28] On the plane
[1718.28 → 1720.36] I'm looking forward
[1720.36 → 1721.04] To trying this
[1721.04 → 1722.78] So much
[1722.78 → 1724.78] I have a Strip Halo laptop
[1724.78 → 1725.30] Yeah
[1725.30 → 1725.90] Oh yeah
[1725.90 → 1727.80] Is this enough
[1727.80 → 1728.92] For me to like
[1728.92 → 1731.06] Load up all my mods
[1731.06 → 1731.44] Probably
[1731.44 → 1732.82] Play VR games
[1732.82 → 1733.34] Probably
[1733.34 → 1734.68] I mean
[1734.68 → 1736.02] It's got a USB port
[1736.02 → 1737.14] So theoretically
[1737.14 → 1737.76] I've got my
[1737.76 → 1739.00] 6 gigahertz wireless
[1739.00 → 1739.74] Like I'm
[1739.74 → 1740.48] Dude
[1740.48 → 1741.86] The frame packs
[1741.86 → 1742.50] I didn't actually
[1742.50 → 1743.34] Talk about that
[1743.34 → 1743.94] In the
[1743.94 → 1744.86] I should start
[1744.86 → 1745.74] Adding some stuff
[1745.74 → 1746.26] For my notes
[1746.26 → 1746.74] For the
[1746.74 → 1747.66] Stuff to talk about
[1747.66 → 1748.44] For the full review
[1748.44 → 1749.78] But I didn't actually
[1749.78 → 1750.82] Really talk about
[1750.82 → 1752.20] How tightly
[1752.20 → 1753.12] It packs up
[1753.12 → 1756.22] Yeah
[1756.22 → 1756.92] That's something
[1756.92 → 1757.62] I was genuinely
[1757.62 → 1758.40] Wondering about
[1758.40 → 1760.04] Because the
[1760.04 → 1760.76] The ability to be
[1760.76 → 1761.30] Portable with
[1761.30 → 1761.64] This thing
[1761.64 → 1762.34] Is actually
[1762.34 → 1763.04] Very interesting
[1763.04 → 1763.36] To me
[1763.36 → 1765.32] This
[1765.32 → 1765.94] I'm excited
[1765.94 → 1766.48] About this
[1766.48 → 1767.94] In regard to
[1767.94 → 1769.22] I don't know
[1769.22 → 1769.66] People are going
[1769.66 → 1769.96] To be like
[1769.96 → 1770.58] Oh you've
[1770.58 → 1771.08] You've been able
[1771.08 → 1771.38] To do this
[1771.38 → 1771.76] The whole time
[1771.76 → 1772.48] With the Quest 3
[1772.48 → 1773.48] I didn't love
[1773.48 → 1774.62] The Quest 3 experience
[1774.62 → 1775.50] Don't love
[1775.50 → 1776.32] Who the Quest 3
[1776.32 → 1776.92] Comes from
[1776.92 → 1777.86] I think that's
[1777.86 → 1778.56] The second one
[1778.56 → 1779.18] Is the bigger one
[1779.18 → 1779.58] For me
[1779.58 → 1780.28] Because apparently
[1780.28 → 1780.92] The software's
[1780.92 → 1781.86] Gotten a lot better
[1781.86 → 1782.76] Since we reviewed it
[1782.76 → 1783.48] I'm sure it has
[1783.48 → 1784.22] They've like
[1784.22 → 1785.08] Apparently
[1785.08 → 1786.12] I'm just going
[1786.12 → 1786.64] Based on
[1786.64 → 1787.58] Comments on
[1787.58 → 1788.58] The frame video
[1788.58 → 1789.48] But apparently
[1789.48 → 1790.10] It's like
[1790.10 → 1791.88] Improved a shocking
[1791.88 → 1792.36] Amount
[1792.36 → 1793.86] For software
[1793.86 → 1794.36] Updates
[1794.36 → 1795.56] So it might be
[1795.56 → 1796.06] Worth me
[1796.06 → 1796.64] Kind of checking
[1796.64 → 1797.30] It out again
[1797.30 → 1798.82] As part of this
[1798.82 → 1799.32] Actually I'm going
[1799.32 → 1800.44] To add that
[1800.44 → 1804.30] Cool
[1804.30 → 1805.76] Now that's on there
[1805.76 → 1807.32] Cool
[1807.32 → 1808.04] Yeah
[1808.04 → 1809.62] So I don't know
[1809.62 → 1810.44] I think my
[1810.44 → 1810.82] Like
[1810.82 → 1812.26] I feel like
[1812.26 → 1812.84] This is it
[1812.84 → 1813.42] I don't feel like
[1813.42 → 1813.80] There's another
[1813.80 → 1815.08] Experience that is
[1815.08 → 1815.64] Going to be this
[1815.64 → 1816.20] Good
[1816.20 → 1817.90] Might not feel
[1817.90 → 1819.26] As strong
[1819.26 → 1819.68] As it did
[1819.68 → 1820.32] In the past
[1820.32 → 1821.00] But I
[1821.00 → 1822.14] I think they're
[1822.14 → 1822.46] Going to be
[1822.46 → 1822.84] Different
[1822.84 → 1824.42] I think they're
[1824.42 → 1824.68] Going to be
[1824.68 → 1825.30] Quite different
[1825.30 → 1825.78] And I
[1825.78 → 1826.50] Don't necessarily
[1826.50 → 1826.88] Think I'm
[1826.88 → 1827.26] Actually going to
[1827.26 → 1827.64] Have that much
[1827.64 → 1827.96] Regret
[1827.96 → 1829.42] Right now
[1829.42 → 1829.94] Having
[1829.94 → 1830.88] Never actually
[1830.88 → 1831.42] Tried the one
[1831.42 → 1831.92] That I bought
[1831.92 → 1832.68] And clearly
[1832.68 → 1833.34] Never tried
[1833.34 → 1833.90] The one that's
[1833.90 → 1834.14] Coming
[1834.14 → 1835.48] But that's my
[1835.48 → 1836.26] Hunch right now
[1836.26 → 1838.98] Yeah
[1838.98 → 1839.38] You want to
[1839.38 → 1840.00] Talk steam machine
[1840.00 → 1840.68] Are you done
[1840.68 → 1841.12] With frame
[1841.12 → 1842.84] I think we can
[1842.84 → 1843.70] Talk steam machine
[1843.70 → 1844.12] Yeah
[1844.12 → 1844.68] I
[1844.68 → 1845.84] I just
[1845.84 → 1846.64] I'm
[1846.64 → 1848.04] The wireless
[1848.04 → 1848.72] Streaming dude
[1848.72 → 1850.42] It blew me away
[1850.42 → 1851.04] I get to have
[1851.04 → 1851.88] PC VR
[1851.88 → 1852.96] Wirelessly
[1852.96 → 1854.90] Wow
[1854.90 → 1856.14] Oh no
[1856.14 → 1856.70] There was the
[1856.70 → 1857.20] Last thing
[1857.20 → 1857.80] What's going to
[1857.80 → 1858.84] Happen to the
[1858.84 → 1859.56] The ecosystem
[1859.56 → 1860.24] Right
[1860.24 → 1861.00] Like could big
[1861.00 → 1862.16] Screen carry on
[1862.16 → 1863.12] Manufacturing base
[1863.12 → 1864.00] Stations for instance
[1864.00 → 1866.30] At this time
[1866.30 → 1867.12] Valve does not
[1867.12 → 1867.68] Appear to have
[1867.68 → 1868.46] Any partnerships
[1868.46 → 1869.14] In place
[1869.14 → 1870.16] For anyone to
[1870.16 → 1870.72] Continue to
[1870.72 → 1870.88] Produce
[1870.88 → 1872.30] Base stations
[1872.30 → 1872.70] Or knuckles
[1872.70 → 1873.24] Controllers
[1873.24 → 1873.76] They did say
[1873.76 → 1874.30] They were open
[1874.30 → 1874.70] To it
[1874.70 → 1876.02] With that
[1876.02 → 1876.52] Said
[1876.52 → 1878.24] I have
[1878.24 → 1878.74] Direct
[1878.74 → 1879.36] Contact
[1879.36 → 1880.00] Information
[1880.00 → 1880.90] For multiple
[1880.90 → 1881.46] People at
[1881.46 → 1881.76] Valve
[1881.76 → 1883.16] They are
[1883.16 → 1885.02] Not always
[1885.02 → 1885.56] The easiest
[1885.56 → 1886.24] To work with
[1886.24 → 1887.20] So
[1887.20 → 1888.30] Just because
[1888.30 → 1888.82] They're open
[1888.82 → 1889.18] To it
[1889.18 → 1889.58] Does not
[1889.58 → 1890.48] Necessarily mean
[1890.48 → 1890.92] That anything
[1890.92 → 1891.48] Will happen
[1891.48 → 1892.84] I'm not
[1892.84 → 1893.20] Going to have
[1893.20 → 1893.86] My hopes up
[1893.86 → 1894.76] Until I see
[1894.76 → 1895.84] Concrete
[1895.84 → 1896.94] Action on it
[1896.94 → 1898.18] And that
[1898.18 → 1899.06] It's not
[1899.06 → 1899.94] It's not a shot
[1899.94 → 1900.78] It's not a shot
[1900.78 → 1901.06] At them
[1901.06 → 1901.64] It's just that
[1901.64 → 1901.98] You got to
[1901.98 → 1902.34] Understand
[1902.34 → 1902.96] Valve's a very
[1902.96 → 1903.66] Small company
[1903.66 → 1907.16] Which
[1907.16 → 1907.84] Headcount wise
[1907.84 → 1908.54] Is actually
[1908.54 → 1909.38] Somewhat true
[1909.38 → 1910.62] Yes
[1910.62 → 1911.56] Which I only
[1911.56 → 1912.58] Mention because
[1912.58 → 1913.70] You know
[1913.70 → 1914.92] That excuse
[1914.92 → 1915.46] Was made
[1915.46 → 1916.34] For some stuff
[1916.34 → 1917.64] I was like
[1917.64 → 1918.00] Okay
[1918.00 → 1918.70] Sure
[1918.70 → 1920.82] Sure
[1920.82 → 1920.86] Sure
[1920.86 → 1922.72] To be clear
[1922.72 → 1923.66] I'm very
[1923.66 → 1924.38] Grateful that
[1924.38 → 1924.82] They were able
[1924.82 → 1925.36] To bring us
[1925.36 → 1925.94] Out to
[1925.94 → 1926.46] To check
[1926.46 → 1926.76] Out the
[1926.76 → 1927.36] New hardware
[1927.36 → 1929.42] I'm very
[1929.42 → 1930.12] Excited
[1930.12 → 1930.74] About the
[1930.74 → 1931.24] New hardware
[1931.24 → 1933.68] And I am
[1933.68 → 1935.22] Extremely excited
[1935.22 → 1936.14] To learn more
[1936.14 → 1937.04] As I get to
[1937.04 → 1938.02] Kind of explore it
[1938.02 → 1939.04] I'm hoping
[1939.04 → 1940.28] That we're going
[1940.28 → 1941.32] To have access
[1941.32 → 1942.16] Prior to the
[1942.16 → 1942.84] Actual launch
[1942.84 → 1943.12] Date
[1943.12 → 1944.02] So that when
[1944.02 → 1944.48] Launch day
[1944.48 → 1945.24] Comes we can
[1945.24 → 1946.02] Bring you guys
[1946.02 → 1946.66] Like really
[1946.66 → 1947.30] Detailed
[1947.30 → 1948.08] Okay but no
[1948.08 → 1949.32] Answering all
[1949.32 → 1950.12] The questions
[1950.12 → 1952.52] Like thick
[1952.52 → 1953.58] Reviews of all
[1953.58 → 1954.14] Of this stuff
[1954.14 → 1955.52] Because it's
[1955.52 → 1956.50] Basically game
[1956.50 → 1957.14] Changing across
[1957.14 → 1957.54] The board
[1957.54 → 1957.94] Which I guess
[1957.94 → 1958.76] Brings us perfectly
[1958.76 → 1959.34] To the steam
[1959.34 → 1959.64] Machine
[1959.64 → 1960.88] It's a new
[1960.88 → 1961.44] Mini pc
[1961.44 → 1962.38] That's boasting
[1962.38 → 1963.30] Roughly six
[1963.30 → 1963.78] Times the
[1963.78 → 1964.46] Performance of the
[1964.46 → 1964.88] Steam deck
[1964.88 → 1965.50] Powered by an
[1965.50 → 1966.42] AMD six core
[1966.42 → 1968.02] Zen four CPU
[1968.02 → 1969.26] A GPU
[1969.26 → 1969.94] That is a
[1969.94 → 1971.28] Semi custom
[1971.28 → 1972.16] Design but
[1972.16 → 1973.30] As far as I
[1973.30 → 1973.78] Can tell
[1973.78 → 1974.98] This pretty
[1974.98 → 1975.62] Much comes
[1975.62 → 1976.28] Down more
[1976.28 → 1977.00] To power
[1977.00 → 1977.84] Profile tuning
[1977.84 → 1978.48] And firmware
[1978.48 → 1980.38] And drivers
[1980.38 → 1981.14] Right like
[1981.14 → 1981.74] The actual
[1981.74 → 1982.58] The actual
[1982.58 → 1983.12] Silicon
[1983.12 → 1984.82] Appears to
[1984.82 → 1986.72] Be more
[1986.72 → 1987.82] Customized in
[1987.82 → 1988.42] The sense that
[1988.42 → 1989.26] AMD is going
[1989.26 → 1989.86] Okay so you
[1989.86 → 1990.36] Want to fuse
[1990.36 → 1991.26] Off this and
[1991.26 → 1993.04] Not that and
[1993.04 → 1994.80] And tune your
[1994.80 → 1995.72] Power profile like
[1995.72 → 1996.42] It's not it's
[1996.42 → 1997.02] Not brand new
[1997.02 → 1998.78] Silicon 16 gigs
[1998.78 → 1999.44] Of so dim
[1999.44 → 2000.50] DDR5 memory
[2000.50 → 2001.70] 8 gigs of
[2001.70 → 2003.26] GDDR6 VRAM
[2003.26 → 2004.24] And either
[2004.24 → 2005.48] 512 gig or
[2005.48 → 2006.66] 2 terabyte
[2006.66 → 2007.72] SSDs but
[2007.72 → 2008.54] The SSD is
[2008.54 → 2009.78] Upgradable to
[2009.78 → 2010.94] A 2280 so
[2010.94 → 2011.48] You could throw
[2011.48 → 2012.00] Up to an
[2012.00 → 2012.64] 8 terabyte
[2012.64 → 2013.26] Drive with
[2013.26 → 2013.60] Current
[2013.60 → 2014.48] NAND
[2014.48 → 2015.22] Densities
[2015.22 → 2017.78] The big deal
[2017.78 → 2018.38] Is of course
[2018.38 → 2019.08] That it runs
[2019.08 → 2020.04] Steam OS
[2020.04 → 2020.60] Yeah
[2020.60 → 2021.68] Linux out of
[2021.68 → 2022.08] The box
[2022.08 → 2023.52] And comes
[2023.52 → 2023.96] With the new
[2023.96 → 2024.88] Steam controller
[2024.88 → 2025.72] It uses
[2025.72 → 2026.44] TMR analog
[2026.44 → 2026.90] Sticks
[2026.90 → 2027.62] Has an
[2027.62 → 2028.58] Xbox style
[2028.58 → 2029.38] Layout with
[2029.38 → 2030.18] A PlayStation
[2030.18 → 2030.96] Analog stick
[2030.96 → 2032.32] Layout to make
[2032.32 → 2032.72] Room for
[2032.72 → 2033.10] The two
[2033.10 → 2033.72] Haptic track
[2033.72 → 2034.28] Pads on
[2034.28 → 2034.68] The bottom
[2034.68 → 2035.38] Similar to
[2035.38 → 2035.74] The steam
[2035.74 → 2036.04] Deck
[2036.04 → 2036.68] How did
[2036.68 → 2037.18] It feels
[2037.18 → 2038.48] To hold
[2038.48 → 2040.06] It looks a little
[2040.06 → 2040.34] Wild
[2040.34 → 2041.38] Smaller hands
[2041.38 → 2042.54] I would say
[2042.54 → 2043.80] Not the most
[2043.80 → 2044.92] Ergonomic controller
[2044.92 → 2045.62] I've ever held
[2045.62 → 2046.70] It did give me
[2046.70 → 2047.74] Obviously not the
[2047.74 → 2048.44] Same, but it did
[2048.44 → 2049.12] Give me like
[2049.12 → 2049.94] Duke vibes
[2049.94 → 2050.78] A little bit
[2050.78 → 2051.46] Not quite
[2051.46 → 2052.26] Yeah okay
[2052.26 → 2054.16] She's not so
[2054.16 → 2054.82] Thick
[2054.82 → 2056.26] Like the duke
[2056.26 → 2056.98] But like
[2056.98 → 2057.62] Tall
[2057.62 → 2058.48] She's
[2058.48 → 2059.18] She's just
[2059.18 → 2059.94] She's just
[2059.94 → 2060.32] You know
[2060.32 → 2061.28] She's girth
[2061.28 → 2062.86] But not thick
[2062.86 → 2063.34] You know
[2063.34 → 2064.00] Like she's
[2064.00 → 2065.52] Like she's
[2065.52 → 2066.46] She's wide
[2066.46 → 2067.40] You know
[2067.40 → 2068.68] Oh this way
[2068.68 → 2069.12] You know
[2069.12 → 2069.72] She's just
[2069.72 → 2070.16] Well no
[2070.16 → 2070.84] She's just
[2070.84 → 2072.58] She's ample
[2072.58 → 2074.02] Okay
[2074.02 → 2075.58] I'd say she's ample
[2075.58 → 2076.60] Was that not a
[2076.60 → 2077.76] Characteristic of the duke
[2077.76 → 2079.16] Yeah but
[2079.16 → 2079.58] You know
[2079.58 → 2080.08] Well the duke
[2080.08 → 2080.66] Was fat
[2080.66 → 2081.72] Okay
[2081.72 → 2082.56] The steam
[2082.56 → 2083.14] Controller's
[2083.14 → 2083.68] Ample
[2083.68 → 2084.92] Okay
[2084.92 → 2085.40] Yeah
[2085.40 → 2086.10] Sure
[2086.10 → 2086.96] Yeah
[2086.96 → 2087.52] Sure
[2087.52 → 2088.16] And I don't mean
[2088.16 → 2089.08] Like pH fat
[2089.08 → 2089.66] The duke was
[2089.66 → 2090.00] FAT
[2090.00 → 2090.62] I think I'm just
[2090.62 → 2091.20] Going to wait
[2091.20 → 2092.02] The duke was fat
[2092.02 → 2092.72] Try it myself
[2092.72 → 2093.84] When I was looking at it
[2093.84 → 2094.64] I thought
[2094.64 → 2095.38] That's probably
[2095.38 → 2096.14] Going to be fine for me
[2096.14 → 2096.76] To be honest
[2096.76 → 2097.14] I'm actually
[2097.14 → 2098.02] Pretty excited about it
[2098.02 → 2098.58] Yeah
[2098.58 → 2100.18] I thought the original
[2100.18 → 2100.80] Steam controller
[2100.80 → 2101.62] Was really cool
[2101.62 → 2102.54] This one seems
[2102.54 → 2103.26] More versatile
[2103.26 → 2104.66] Which is neat
[2104.66 → 2105.54] Although to be
[2105.54 → 2106.22] Completely honest
[2106.22 → 2107.34] If you can afford it
[2107.34 → 2107.98] I feel like
[2107.98 → 2109.20] The play
[2109.20 → 2109.86] Is going to be
[2109.86 → 2110.74] To have a normal
[2110.74 → 2111.28] Controller
[2111.28 → 2113.02] And then just
[2113.02 → 2113.86] Maybe also
[2113.86 → 2114.70] Your steam controller
[2114.70 → 2115.16] Yeah
[2115.16 → 2115.70] Cause the
[2115.70 → 2116.34] The touchpads
[2116.34 → 2116.88] On steam controller
[2116.88 → 2117.62] Will be nice
[2117.62 → 2118.04] Sometimes
[2118.04 → 2119.00] Yeah and super cool
[2119.00 → 2119.30] Yeah
[2119.30 → 2120.32] And some people
[2120.32 → 2121.48] Are going to just
[2121.48 → 2123.22] Daily the crap
[2123.22 → 2124.28] Out of the touchpads
[2124.28 → 2124.78] Yeah
[2124.78 → 2126.54] Obviously there will be
[2126.54 → 2127.06] Certain games
[2127.06 → 2127.40] That will play
[2127.40 → 2127.76] A lot better
[2127.76 → 2128.10] That way
[2128.10 → 2129.16] Particularly for
[2129.16 → 2129.68] Old dogs
[2129.68 → 2130.34] That don't want
[2130.34 → 2131.12] To learn new tricks
[2131.12 → 2131.96] A more traditional
[2131.96 → 2132.42] Controller
[2132.42 → 2133.00] And man
[2133.00 → 2134.56] There's so many
[2134.56 → 2135.58] Great
[2135.58 → 2135.64] Great
[2135.64 → 2136.92] Super cool
[2136.92 → 2137.98] Innovative controllers
[2137.98 → 2138.38] Out there
[2138.38 → 2138.44] Yeah
[2138.44 → 2138.70] Like
[2138.70 → 2140.18] After doing that
[2140.18 → 2141.16] Controller tier list
[2141.16 → 2142.02] Video with David
[2142.02 → 2142.60] Where we did the
[2142.60 → 2143.60] Whole like playoff
[2143.60 → 2144.86] Man I
[2144.86 → 2145.44] I don't
[2145.44 → 2147.24] I don't think
[2147.24 → 2147.96] You can get away
[2147.96 → 2148.52] With having a
[2148.52 → 2149.04] Top of the line
[2149.04 → 2149.88] Controller anymore
[2149.88 → 2150.78] That doesn't have
[2150.78 → 2151.56] Adjustable tension
[2151.56 → 2152.42] On the analog sticks
[2152.42 → 2153.32] Like it's just
[2153.32 → 2154.64] It was so
[2154.64 → 2155.82] Game changing
[2155.82 → 2156.44] Yeah
[2156.44 → 2157.86] For me anyway
[2157.86 → 2158.74] That I was just like
[2158.74 → 2159.70] Well everything else
[2159.70 → 2160.84] Is basic now
[2160.84 → 2162.22] And that doesn't mean
[2162.22 → 2163.04] That I necessarily
[2163.04 → 2163.48] You know
[2163.48 → 2164.12] Want to go and
[2164.12 → 2165.22] Replace every controller
[2165.22 → 2165.80] In my house
[2165.80 → 2166.64] With those
[2166.64 → 2167.42] In some cases
[2167.42 → 2169.16] Quite expensive
[2169.16 → 2170.68] After market controllers
[2170.68 → 2171.06] But
[2171.06 → 2172.84] Little brother controllers
[2172.84 → 2174.26] Are the big brother
[2174.26 → 2175.06] Controller now
[2175.06 → 2176.18] It's not the way
[2176.18 → 2176.88] That it used to be
[2176.88 → 2177.58] Where first party
[2177.58 → 2178.06] Was king
[2178.06 → 2179.66] What is cool
[2179.66 → 2180.14] About the steam
[2180.14 → 2180.74] Controller though
[2180.74 → 2181.82] Is each of their
[2181.82 → 2182.26] Puck
[2182.26 → 2184.72] Wireless dongles
[2184.72 → 2185.50] Supports up to
[2185.50 → 2186.20] Four of them
[2186.20 → 2187.94] And steam will
[2187.94 → 2188.74] Support up to
[2188.74 → 2189.48] Four pucks
[2189.48 → 2190.66] Meaning sixteen
[2190.66 → 2191.58] Controllers to one
[2191.58 → 2191.92] Machine
[2191.92 → 2192.64] Making for
[2192.64 → 2193.98] Hassle free
[2193.98 → 2194.62] Ten player
[2194.62 → 2195.16] Tape to tape
[2195.16 → 2195.70] Which is all that
[2195.70 → 2196.40] I really care about
[2196.40 → 2197.26] As far as that goes
[2197.26 → 2199.50] There's a lot more
[2199.50 → 2200.24] To break down
[2200.24 → 2201.48] Once we actually
[2201.48 → 2202.24] You know
[2202.24 → 2204.12] Finish reviewing
[2204.12 → 2204.70] These devices
[2204.70 → 2205.26] And there's actually
[2205.26 → 2205.96] More details
[2205.96 → 2206.98] In the two main
[2206.98 → 2208.04] Channel LTT videos
[2208.04 → 2208.58] That we have up
[2208.58 → 2209.12] On these devices
[2209.12 → 2209.76] You guys can go
[2209.76 → 2210.36] Check those out
[2210.36 → 2211.62] But in the meantime
[2211.62 → 2212.96] I want to talk
[2212.96 → 2213.62] About pricing
[2213.62 → 2214.36] For the steam
[2214.36 → 2214.72] Machine
[2214.72 → 2216.96] Actually no
[2216.96 → 2217.80] What I want you
[2217.80 → 2218.34] Guys to do
[2218.34 → 2218.68] Chat
[2218.68 → 2219.36] Get out of here
[2219.36 → 2221.68] Is let me know
[2221.68 → 2222.16] What you would
[2222.16 → 2222.76] Pay for it
[2222.76 → 2224.12] So basically
[2224.12 → 2224.66] It's a
[2224.66 → 2224.96] It's a
[2224.96 → 2226.14] 7600 CPU
[2226.14 → 2227.34] And a
[2227.34 → 2228.52] 7600 GPU
[2228.52 → 2229.42] This is not
[2229.42 → 2230.38] A super powerful
[2230.38 → 2230.90] Machine
[2230.90 → 2232.62] Valve is
[2232.62 → 2233.70] Up front
[2233.70 → 2234.38] Saying that
[2234.38 → 2234.80] They are going
[2234.80 → 2235.58] To be relying
[2235.58 → 2237.28] On FSR
[2237.28 → 2237.88] In order to
[2237.88 → 2239.10] Achieve 4k
[2239.10 → 2240.64] And even
[2240.64 → 2241.20] Than man
[2241.20 → 2242.02] Like 8 gigs
[2242.02 → 2242.60] VRAM
[2242.60 → 2244.22] Anyone else
[2244.22 → 2245.16] Would be taking
[2245.16 → 2246.86] A ton of flack
[2246.86 → 2248.32] For shipping a game
[2248.32 → 2249.12] Console today
[2249.12 → 2249.78] With 8 gigs
[2249.78 → 2250.28] Of VRAM
[2250.28 → 2250.68] Yeah
[2250.68 → 2253.40] So we've got a lot
[2253.40 → 2254.06] Of people talking
[2254.06 → 2254.76] Pricing in here
[2254.76 → 2255.04] I'm gonna
[2255.04 → 2255.62] I'm going to read
[2255.62 → 2256.00] These
[2256.00 → 2257.06] 600
[2257.06 → 2257.48] 600
[2257.48 → 2257.90] 600
[2257.90 → 2258.28] 600
[2258.28 → 2258.78] 600
[2258.78 → 2259.32] 350
[2259.32 → 2260.16] 800
[2260.16 → 2261.26] Maybe 600
[2261.26 → 2262.26] 1000
[2262.26 → 2263.12] You're crazy
[2263.12 → 2264.46] 500
[2264.46 → 2265.42] Tops
[2265.42 → 2266.30] Or DOA
[2266.30 → 2267.12] 250
[2267.12 → 2268.18] PS5
[2268.18 → 2268.70] So like
[2268.70 → 2270.28] 500 to 600
[2270.28 → 2271.58] 599
[2271.58 → 2272.22] 699
[2272.22 → 2272.96] 500
[2272.96 → 2274.10] Okay
[2274.10 → 2277.46] A lot of
[2277.46 → 2278.48] 500 to 600
[2278.48 → 2279.66] I don't think so
[2279.66 → 2280.64] I
[2280.64 → 2281.76] Can't tell you
[2281.76 → 2282.70] What the price will be
[2282.70 → 2283.68] Because I literally
[2283.68 → 2284.30] Don't know
[2284.30 → 2286.32] But when I said
[2286.32 → 2287.82] You know
[2287.82 → 2289.60] I'm disappointed
[2289.60 → 2290.98] That it isn't going to
[2290.98 → 2292.00] Follow a console
[2292.00 → 2293.26] Pricing model
[2293.26 → 2294.72] Where it's
[2294.72 → 2295.56] Subsidized
[2295.56 → 2296.46] By the fact that
[2296.46 → 2297.04] You know
[2297.04 → 2297.72] The manufacturer
[2297.72 → 2298.54] Is going to be taking
[2298.54 → 2299.92] 30% of every game
[2299.92 → 2300.54] Sold on it
[2300.54 → 2301.08] Over the
[2301.08 → 2302.52] Lifespan of this thing
[2302.52 → 2304.26] Because I feel
[2304.26 → 2305.24] That would be a more
[2305.24 → 2306.50] Meaningful
[2306.50 → 2307.02] Product
[2307.02 → 2309.38] And they kind of
[2309.38 → 2310.10] Asked what I meant
[2310.10 → 2310.60] By well
[2310.60 → 2311.86] What do you mean by
[2311.86 → 2313.10] Console price
[2313.10 → 2314.08] And I said
[2314.08 → 2314.32] Well
[2314.32 → 2315.06] 500
[2315.06 → 2317.86] Nobody said
[2317.86 → 2318.34] Anything
[2318.34 → 2320.48] But the energy
[2320.48 → 2321.10] Of the room
[2321.10 → 2322.72] Wasn't great
[2322.72 → 2324.70] So
[2324.70 → 2325.68] Oh a console
[2325.68 → 2326.66] Isn't 500 bucks
[2326.66 → 2327.42] Maybe that's why
[2327.42 → 2331.06] I mean
[2331.06 → 2332.38] PS5 Pro is
[2332.38 → 2332.74] 700
[2332.74 → 2334.06] Yeah the PS5 Pro
[2334.06 → 2334.60] But we're talking
[2334.60 → 2334.96] The Pro
[2334.96 → 2335.46] I mean the Pro
[2335.46 → 2336.44] Is markedly
[2336.44 → 2336.96] More powerful
[2336.96 → 2337.48] Than the Steam
[2337.48 → 2337.78] Machine
[2337.78 → 2339.30] True
[2339.30 → 2340.44] So
[2340.44 → 2342.10] PS5 Pro
[2342.10 → 2342.68] Radeon
[2342.68 → 2343.18] Equivalent
[2343.18 → 2343.66] I think it's
[2343.66 → 2344.52] More equivalent
[2344.52 → 2345.02] To like
[2345.02 → 2346.42] A 7700
[2346.42 → 2347.02] I'll follow
[2347.02 → 2347.66] Consoles enough
[2347.66 → 2348.62] Let me have a look
[2348.62 → 2349.64] Let me have a look
[2349.64 → 2350.44] So that is
[2350.44 → 2351.34] More equivalent
[2351.34 → 2352.28] To a
[2352.28 → 2353.78] 7700 XT
[2353.78 → 2355.60] And then
[2355.60 → 2356.18] The base
[2356.18 → 2356.84] PS5
[2356.84 → 2357.80] Is about
[2357.80 → 2358.40] An RX
[2358.40 → 2359.28] 6700
[2359.28 → 2360.32] So
[2360.32 → 2361.18] The base
[2361.18 → 2361.68] PS5
[2361.68 → 2362.34] Is closer
[2362.34 → 2363.10] To the Steam
[2363.10 → 2363.34] Machine
[2363.34 → 2363.88] In terms of
[2363.88 → 2364.36] Performance
[2364.36 → 2365.82] With that said
[2365.82 → 2366.18] You know
[2366.18 → 2366.82] It's not like
[2366.82 → 2367.16] The Steam
[2367.16 → 2367.54] Machine
[2367.54 → 2368.32] Even if it's
[2368.32 → 2369.08] At 600
[2369.08 → 2369.66] Or 700
[2369.66 → 2370.66] Isn't going to
[2370.66 → 2371.00] Have any
[2371.00 → 2371.72] Justification
[2371.72 → 2372.18] For it
[2372.18 → 2372.82] The disk
[2372.82 → 2373.18] Drive
[2373.18 → 2374.12] PS5
[2374.12 → 2374.68] Non-Pro
[2374.68 → 2375.54] Is 550
[2375.54 → 2376.10] Does the
[2376.10 → 2376.32] Steam
[2376.32 → 2376.56] Machine
[2376.56 → 2376.92] Have a
[2376.92 → 2377.20] Disk
[2377.20 → 2377.70] Drive
[2377.70 → 2378.30] No
[2378.30 → 2379.20] Okay than
[2379.20 → 2380.98] Well I don't
[2380.98 → 2381.32] Think so
[2381.32 → 2382.46] It has a lot
[2382.46 → 2383.02] Of other stuff
[2383.02 → 2383.60] Going on though
[2383.60 → 2384.74] Yeah I mean
[2384.74 → 2385.88] Compared to a
[2385.88 → 2386.18] PlayStation
[2386.18 → 2387.64] Yeah you can
[2387.64 → 2388.18] Use it as a
[2388.18 → 2388.52] Computer
[2388.52 → 2389.56] But I think
[2389.56 → 2389.94] A lot of
[2389.94 → 2390.62] People won't
[2390.62 → 2391.94] And the fact
[2391.94 → 2392.48] That Valve
[2392.48 → 2392.84] Is shipping
[2392.84 → 2393.22] This thing
[2393.22 → 2393.56] With a
[2393.56 → 2393.98] Controller
[2393.98 → 2395.40] Tells me
[2395.40 → 2395.96] That this is
[2395.96 → 2397.12] A controller
[2397.12 → 2397.74] With touchpads
[2397.74 → 2398.00] On it
[2398.00 → 2398.70] And all but
[2398.70 → 2399.46] One demo
[2399.46 → 2400.54] All but
[2400.54 → 2401.22] One demo
[2401.22 → 2401.82] That they had
[2401.82 → 2402.10] In their
[2402.10 → 2402.64] Big like
[2402.64 → 2403.24] Demo room
[2403.24 → 2404.24] Was it
[2404.24 → 2404.56] Hooked up
[2404.56 → 2404.98] To a TV
[2404.98 → 2406.06] Like it
[2406.06 → 2406.46] Wasn't
[2406.46 → 2406.98] They had
[2406.98 → 2407.46] The one
[2407.46 → 2407.82] Where it was
[2407.82 → 2408.16] Hooked up
[2408.16 → 2408.58] To a monitor
[2408.58 → 2409.14] TVs
[2409.14 → 2409.90] For sure
[2409.90 → 2410.44] Right
[2410.44 → 2411.68] I still just
[2411.68 → 2412.04] Think it's
[2412.04 → 2412.40] It's not
[2412.40 → 2412.76] It's not
[2412.76 → 2413.16] Completely
[2413.16 → 2413.76] Equivalent
[2413.76 → 2416.48] I mean
[2416.48 → 2417.66] Yeah
[2417.66 → 2418.44] I'm not surprised
[2418.44 → 2418.82] It would be
[2418.82 → 2419.32] More expensive
[2419.32 → 2420.10] I think it
[2420.10 → 2420.74] Honestly makes
[2420.74 → 2421.16] Sense that it
[2421.16 → 2421.40] Would probably
[2421.40 → 2422.00] Be more expensive
[2422.00 → 2423.48] There's not
[2423.48 → 2425.80] Which one
[2425.80 → 2426.04] Would be
[2426.04 → 2426.58] More expensive
[2426.58 → 2427.50] The
[2427.50 → 2427.90] Steam
[2427.90 → 2428.10] Machine
[2428.10 → 2429.22] What is it
[2429.22 → 2429.50] Adding
[2429.50 → 2431.92] It's a
[2431.92 → 2432.30] Computer
[2432.30 → 2433.14] Sure
[2433.14 → 2434.64] How much
[2434.64 → 2435.04] Are you going
[2435.04 → 2435.80] To compute
[2435.80 → 2436.66] From
[2436.66 → 2437.70] Your couch
[2437.70 → 2440.04] I can
[2440.04 → 2440.54] Definitely
[2440.54 → 2441.04] See people
[2441.04 → 2441.58] Using it
[2441.58 → 2442.10] In that
[2442.10 → 2442.36] Way
[2442.36 → 2442.60] And I
[2442.60 → 2442.82] Can see
[2442.82 → 2443.08] That being
[2443.08 → 2443.46] A value
[2443.46 → 2443.86] Add for
[2443.86 → 2444.16] People
[2444.16 → 2444.46] And it
[2444.46 → 2444.82] Being more
[2444.82 → 2445.14] Expensive
[2445.14 → 2445.58] Because of
[2445.58 → 2445.78] That
[2445.78 → 2447.04] Sure
[2447.04 → 2447.48] I'm just
[2447.48 → 2447.80] Saying I
[2447.80 → 2448.38] Understand why
[2448.38 → 2448.76] The pricing
[2448.76 → 2449.16] Might work
[2449.16 → 2449.56] That way
[2449.56 → 2450.10] I'm not
[2450.10 → 2450.52] Saying it's
[2450.52 → 2450.84] Good
[2450.84 → 2451.14] When you
[2451.14 → 2451.46] We're saying
[2451.46 → 2451.94] There's more
[2451.94 → 2452.28] To it
[2452.28 → 2452.48] I thought
[2452.48 → 2452.70] You meant
[2452.70 → 2453.12] There's like
[2453.12 → 2453.72] More hardware
[2453.72 → 2454.18] That I'm not
[2454.18 → 2454.84] Accounting for
[2454.84 → 2455.18] That would
[2455.18 → 2455.58] Make it
[2455.58 → 2456.24] Like the cost
[2456.24 → 2456.52] Higher
[2456.52 → 2456.92] It's a
[2456.92 → 2458.24] Different device
[2458.24 → 2458.90] Sure
[2458.90 → 2459.22] Yeah
[2459.22 → 2459.52] Yeah
[2459.52 → 2459.80] It's a
[2459.80 → 2460.30] Different device
[2460.30 → 2460.80] But you
[2460.80 → 2461.36] Know for me
[2461.36 → 2461.74] Look the
[2461.74 → 2462.36] Question is
[2462.36 → 2462.92] Like from a
[2462.92 → 2463.58] Performance
[2463.58 → 2464.30] Standpoint
[2467.70 → 2468.14] Going to hook up
[2468.14 → 2468.42] To my
[2468.42 → 2468.80] TV
[2468.80 → 2469.30] I'm not
[2469.30 → 2469.80] Computing
[2469.80 → 2470.58] I'm gaming
[2470.58 → 2471.08] I'm gaming
[2471.08 → 2471.44] From my
[2471.44 → 2471.74] Couch
[2471.74 → 2472.72] So the
[2472.72 → 2473.36] Biggest justification
[2473.36 → 2474.06] To me is that
[2474.06 → 2474.44] I can take
[2474.44 → 2474.88] Advantage of
[2474.88 → 2475.36] Steam sales
[2475.36 → 2475.68] I don't have
[2475.68 → 2475.90] To buy
[2475.90 → 2476.30] Things in
[2476.30 → 2476.40] The
[2476.40 → 2476.66] PlayStation
[2476.66 → 2477.18] Store
[2477.18 → 2478.54] That's
[2478.54 → 2479.52] If it's
[2479.52 → 2479.78] Going to be
[2479.78 → 2480.44] More expensive
[2480.44 → 2480.98] That's the
[2480.98 → 2481.68] More meaningful
[2481.68 → 2482.10] There are
[2482.10 → 2482.70] Benefits to
[2482.70 → 2483.40] It being a
[2483.40 → 2484.28] Compute device
[2484.28 → 2484.90] On your
[2484.90 → 2485.18] TV
[2485.18 → 2485.88] For sure
[2485.88 → 2486.26] Sure
[2486.26 → 2486.60] I think
[2486.60 → 2487.02] Saying no
[2487.02 → 2487.24] To that
[2487.24 → 2487.70] Is crazy
[2487.70 → 2487.94] I mean
[2487.94 → 2488.54] Hit me
[2488.54 → 2489.60] Like what
[2489.60 → 2489.78] You can
[2489.78 → 2490.48] Pirate things
[2490.48 → 2491.16] Okay but
[2491.16 → 2491.54] I can't
[2491.54 → 2492.22] Watch like
[2492.22 → 2493.10] Proper HDR
[2493.10 → 2493.46] Netflix
[2493.46 → 2494.28] Because it's
[2494.28 → 2494.52] Linux
[2494.52 → 2496.84] I mean
[2496.84 → 2497.76] You could
[2497.76 → 2498.58] It would be
[2498.58 → 2499.08] Annoying
[2499.08 → 2499.40] But you
[2499.40 → 2499.72] Could
[2499.72 → 2500.42] You can
[2500.42 → 2500.84] Does it
[2500.84 → 2501.36] Is that
[2501.36 → 2501.96] Supported now
[2501.96 → 2502.30] Because I'm
[2502.30 → 2502.60] Not aware
[2502.60 → 2502.90] Of it
[2502.90 → 2503.94] Virtual machine
[2503.94 → 2505.08] Over if you
[2505.08 → 2505.40] Carried
[2505.40 → 2505.98] HDR
[2505.98 → 2507.34] With what
[2507.34 → 2507.76] Streaming
[2507.76 → 2508.18] Platform
[2508.18 → 2510.16] Sorry
[2510.16 → 2510.64] What
[2510.64 → 2511.90] Like watching
[2511.90 → 2512.50] HDR
[2512.50 → 2513.30] Like
[2513.30 → 2515.28] Like DRM
[2515.28 → 2515.88] Protected
[2515.88 → 2516.40] HDR
[2516.40 → 2516.82] Netflix
[2516.82 → 2517.18] No
[2517.18 → 2517.80] You can't
[2517.80 → 2518.22] Do that
[2518.22 → 2518.54] Through
[2518.54 → 2518.98] Windows
[2518.98 → 2519.68] If you

[2754.42 → 2754.56] $500
[2754.56 → 2755.94] I'm
[2755.94 → 2756.12] Not
[2756.12 → 2756.58] Excited
[2756.58 → 2757.80] It's
[2757.80 → 2758.24] Okay
[2758.24 → 2759.14] But
[2759.14 → 2759.32] It's
[2759.32 → 2759.50] Not
[2759.50 → 2760.16] Exciting

[2761.56 → 2761.70] The
[2761.70 → 2762.10] Exciting
[2762.10 → 2762.34] Part
[2762.34 → 2762.50] Is
[2762.50 → 2762.68] Just
[2762.68 → 2762.96] Steam
[2762.96 → 2763.20] OS
[2763.20 → 2763.38] On
[2763.38 → 2763.72] More
[2763.72 → 2765.12] Pieces
[2765.12 → 2765.28] Of
[2765.28 → 2765.60] Hardware
[2765.60 → 2767.48] That
[2767.48 → 2767.58] Are
[2767.58 → 2767.74] Being
[2767.74 → 2768.00] Sold
[2768.00 → 2768.16] To
[2768.16 → 2768.44] People
[2768.44 → 2769.22] Yeah
[2769.22 → 2769.50] And
[2769.50 → 2769.76] That's
[2769.76 → 2770.12] Cool
[2770.12 → 2771.06] And
[2771.06 → 2771.38] You
[2771.38 → 2771.50] Know
[2771.50 → 2771.84] I'm
[2771.84 → 2772.26] Still
[2772.26 → 2772.88] You
[2772.88 → 2773.04] Know
[2773.04 → 2773.48] Four
[2773.48 → 2773.78] Years
[2773.78 → 2774.06] Later
[2774.06 → 2774.64] Very
[2774.64 → 2775.14] Excited
[2775.14 → 2775.56] For
[2775.56 → 2776.00] Steam
[2776.00 → 2776.26] OS
[2776.26 → 2776.42] To
[2776.42 → 2776.70] Become
[2776.70 → 2776.92] A
[2776.92 → 2777.04] More
[2777.04 → 2777.30] Main
[2777.30 → 2777.72] Thing
[2777.72 → 2777.94] That's
[2777.94 → 2778.18] Easier
[2778.18 → 2778.36] To
[2778.36 → 2778.72] Install
[2778.72 → 2778.92] On
[2778.92 → 2779.02] A
[2779.02 → 2779.60] Wide
[2779.60 → 2779.88] Range
[2779.88 → 2780.00] Of
[2780.00 → 2780.30] Hardware
[2782.08 → 2789.04] of like what I need in my life if it doesn't come with aggressive pricing, and it was a little
[2789.04 → 2793.20] surprising to me that it wasn't going to be priced like a console because the steam deck
[2793.92 → 2801.92] pretty much was and still is you look at it compared to you know the AYA news and the rogue
[2801.92 → 2808.48] allies of the world, and they are undercutting them significantly but valve made the strategic
[2808.48 → 2814.90] decision in this case not to do custom silicon that would yield them a large savings over a very
[2814.90 → 2820.32] large volume product which tells me you know a couple of things one is that they don't necessarily
[2820.32 → 2826.68] know if this is going to be a high volume product this, or it tells me that they don't even want to
[2826.68 → 2831.50] interfere with the ecosystem which you know was part of the conversation that we had even though
[2831.50 → 2837.68] they couldn't give me like firm reasons around everything interesting yeah I mean they've had much
[2837.68 → 2843.14] stronger partnerships with especially PlayStation but also Xbox recently so maybe they're like
[2843.14 → 2849.36] kind of semi joining the space but trying to do it in a fairly friendly way and that would be true to
[2849.36 → 2855.02] the original vision for steam machine like if you recall steam machine the one that I have the like
[2855.02 → 2861.62] the like prototype like wide boy one that was not a real product they launched with partners like
[2861.62 → 2869.74] alienware you could make it in that box of course I am come on man come on by the way uh I just looked
[2869.74 → 2873.78] this up I don't know if it's the same one that got linked to you there are a few threads that I found
[2873.78 → 2880.24] talking oh yeah there we go um and somebody already said that it like works with uh steam deck
[2880.24 → 2885.88] oh interesting, and apparently it advertises somewhere that it's like uh compatible with
[2885.88 → 2892.92] yeah macOS oh now they say Linux okay USB 2.0 is a disappointment um so I'll have to I'll have to
[2892.92 → 2897.34] look around there might also be other ones I don't know I'll have to see what's out there but um but
[2897.34 → 2903.24] that's definitely something that we'd have to we'd have to factor in yeah someone in twitch chat uh
[2903.24 → 2908.28] just said dark horse said pulse 8 yeah these guys are legit and I've seen a few threads talking about
[2908.28 → 2915.16] maybe they have a different one that's not you know 2.0 anymore I don't know man I'm I'm excited
[2915.16 → 2921.86] for the idea of the year of the Linux desktop what I'm not excited about is it not having a console
[2921.86 → 2927.80] like price and the other thing that's great about consoles is the way that they tend to plummet in
[2927.80 → 2933.84] value like yeah this will have that problem I suspect you well no, no no I don't think it will
[2933.84 → 2938.22] really because it's a pc i just the reason why I think so is just because it's like
[2938.22 → 2944.30] already slow and old you think so okay that's kind of a hot take people don't like people calling it
[2944.30 → 2949.82] slow and old uh hubs sort of under fire for calling it I think slow and old or something like that
[2949.82 → 2958.42] really yeah as a newly as a device that's coming out next year that feels based on what we expect
[2958.42 → 2964.90] the price will be that feels true to me uh Mr foray uh USB 2 did I say USB 2 was a disappointment
[2964.90 → 2970.98] I meant HDMI 2 was a disappointment I'd like it to be 2.1 at this point um that that dongle
[2970.98 → 2980.54] the USB doesn't matter um all right I'm not no okay so to be clear uh that 2500k system that i
[2980.54 → 2986.90] mentioned on I think last one show is playing arc raiders right now right so being old doesn't
[2986.90 → 2992.90] necessarily even mean that big of a deal I just think it's not the CPU I'm worried about exactly it's
[2992.90 → 2997.30] 600 8 gig GPU and the fact that valve is even talking about 4k on it
[2997.30 → 3004.88] in fairness to them, they did attach that to upscaling they are being very upfront yeah that they mean
[3004.88 → 3014.98] with FSR which basically means not 4k not actually yeah um but like we are probably what two
[3014.98 → 3020.96] years now from PlayStation 6 which means we're probably three to four years from games that are
[3020.96 → 3027.22] actually going to leverage PlayStation 6 hardware um meaning that valve has kind of like a half a
[3027.22 → 3033.80] console generation before they can't with a straight face say yeah it'll run basically you
[3033.80 → 3040.26] know high-end games on steam at 4k 60 fps with FSR because all the FSR in the world is not going to
[3040.26 → 3044.40] make a PlayStation 6 game it just sucks that that's going to be true for such a short period of time
[3044.40 → 3051.12] like you're saying exactly but Mr nick 88 in twitch chat did also say quote from valve engineer uh
[3051.12 → 3058.50] Kazan aldehyde I think I hope sure um the steam machine is equal to or better than what 70 percent
[3058.50 → 3061.90] of people have at home and that's an interesting comment because it's not
[3061.90 → 3072.86] it's so open that it will like if you is I think about the types of games that I'm usually going
[3072.86 → 3080.62] to want to be playing on my TV it will probably be fine for a significantly longer period of time yeah
[3080.62 → 3085.38] you can play the crap out of castle crashers exactly your steam machine exactly most like couch co-op
[3085.38 → 3092.58] things what's that RV game uh moving out oh no that's the different RV there yet yeah that
[3092.58 → 3098.96] game I'm sure it'll run completely fine but also moving out um sure you know overcooked like yeah all
[3098.96 → 3104.14] those games will be no problem for basically like ever what's that Mario party clone but like more
[3104.14 → 3109.54] violent you know the one I'm talking about right he would now pummel party yeah pummel party like
[3109.54 → 3115.32] stuff like that's going to run on it no problem right so to be clear I'm not saying it's
[3115.32 → 3122.42] like bad no I'm just saying that I'm just saying that compared to a PlayStation 5 which I can
[3122.42 → 3126.62] literally get on Facebook marketplace for like what did I pay for the one in scrapyard wars
[3126.62 → 3133.04] like less than 400 Canadian dollars yeah yeah that's tough uh that's tough that's tough and there
[3133.04 → 3141.00] are benefits to a device like that over this like for instance being able to stream protected content
[3141.00 → 3145.08] which and I get it I know our audiences there's a lot of piracy there's a lot of
[3145.08 → 3151.56] sailing the high seas yes, but that's not everybody right, and so we do have to acknowledge
[3151.56 → 3157.92] that for a lot of people the steam machine is not just going to be a no-brainer like no obviously
[3157.92 → 3161.72] anything else is stupid I think another thing that'll hurt it and i I didn't articulate this
[3161.72 → 3167.60] earlier but I did mean to earlier I just forgot um is that I don't think this is going to have
[3167.60 → 3177.32] uh an almost unique-less value it is cool it's its the first steam machine that's actually publicly
[3177.32 → 3183.38] available it has steam OS all that kind of stuff for sale well I mean there were the old ones they
[3183.38 → 3187.18] were for sale oh I didn't even know that yeah nobody bought them okay yeah I didn't know they
[3187.18 → 3193.66] actually went for sale uh I thought anyway whatever um something about old consoles that keeps their value
[3193.66 → 3201.26] is the like there are probably games that only work on this, or it had a unique experience
[3201.26 → 3206.28] for some particular reason so the way that they drop because there's so many of them but then they
[3206.28 → 3209.92] hold, and then they'll go up, and then they'll eventually I don't think that's going to happen here
[3209.92 → 3212.80] exactly it's just going to be an old computer yes which
[3212.80 → 3221.54] yeah we'll see how it goes I find old computers will it again they'll drop, and they'll hold for a
[3221.54 → 3227.80] long time, but then they just plummet they'll hit a wall where it's like this just kind of sucks now
[3227.80 → 3232.16] it's not getting driver updates anymore these various things are happening I mean and then get
[3232.16 → 3237.46] ditched Linux though the fact that it runs Linux, and you don't have to worry about Microsoft just like
[3237.46 → 3241.92] rug pulling your ability to boot the latest OS that's getting that might help it be
[3241.92 → 3246.50] more legit for longer yeah I think there's going to be a lot at play in its ability to hold value
[3246.50 → 3253.94] for sure baby okay the last thing before we bring Elijah on and talk about Linus x Linus is the steam
[3253.94 → 3261.10] controller yes specifically the name so I took a bit of a shot at valve for calling the steam controller
[3261.10 → 3267.18] steam controller when they already have a product called steam controller
[3267.18 → 3275.92] they sure do they sure do like if you google steam controller it says steam controller on steam
[3275.92 → 3281.50] the picture is the old one you click on it, and it's right there they did add 2015 now
[3281.50 → 3287.74] yeah so I did take a little bit of flack for this in the comments as well that's a stupid
[3287.74 → 3293.62] that's a stupid critique Linus that one has been long discontinued there's no way that anyone
[3293.62 → 3299.26] would get confused about it when the new one is like you know obviously the new one I googled steam
[3299.26 → 3311.36] controller and my response to that is no this is unconscionable this is not okay anything can ever
[3311.36 → 3318.46] be named the same thing exactly as another product because it serves literally no purpose other than to
[3318.46 → 3325.32] be confusing so counterpoint you're right in the near future there won't be a ton of confusion
[3325.32 → 3331.72] because all the SEO will be towards the new one yeah okay well here's something what if you have an
[3331.72 → 3336.88] old one, and you're trying to do a battery swap or something like that on it well I guess go f**k
[3336.88 → 3344.40] yourself cool also what about 10 years from now when they are both old and obsolete, and you are trying
[3344.40 → 3350.70] to find information you're trying to find a how-to guide, or you're trying to well I mean yeah that's
[3350.70 → 3354.88] that's the biggest one is it pretty much my objection to this comes down to ease of finding
[3354.88 → 3361.62] information and right to repair calling something the exact same thing is completely unnecessary
[3361.62 → 3370.06] completely unnecessary and can lead to nothing but confusion and when I asked valve point-blank
[3370.06 → 3377.36] why did you do this they said it was because it would reduce confusion
[3377.36 → 3389.50] that was actually the f**king reason which to me, i i I don't I don't accept in to play devil's
[3389.50 → 3396.62] advocate sure apple's done this forever yeah which is exactly what I brought up, and they acknowledged
[3396.62 → 3402.34] what a problem it is and I do think considering the amount of steam controllers out there especially
[3402.34 → 3407.86] that are still in use this might actually reduce confusion because the amount of people the amount
[3407.86 → 3413.96] of people that will have the new one and just not even know the old one existed but tell me this
[3413.96 → 3419.70] if they called it steam controller 2 it would have been fine how would that confuse anybody
[3419.70 → 3424.54] I don't necessarily think it would, I have a fun thing though that's going to hurt some people's
[3424.54 → 3429.48] brains is this actually how it works does the USB port not line up with the little led thing don't
[3429.48 → 3438.30] worry about it would get this what no you can't move on from that yeah we're not we're not
[3438.30 → 3444.08] bring that back we're not done yet no we're not going back to that no so when I talked to them, I was
[3444.08 → 3452.42] like look guys do you want to be Microsoft like do you want to have stupid naming schemes that don't
[3452.42 → 3458.36] make any sense or like to look you know look at one of the other players in the console space
[3458.36 → 3465.08] Sony hasn't run into fucking confusion okay by calling the PlayStation 2 PlayStation 2 here's a
[3465.08 → 3468.78] question for you, I'm not done yet why did it not bother you that no I'm not I'm not done
[3468.78 → 3476.04] so they didn't run into confusion calling it PlayStation 3 that's not confusing in spite of
[3476.04 → 3481.14] the fact that far more people bought a PlayStation 2 than a PlayStation 1 consoles went way more
[3481.14 → 3486.82] mainstream especially in the west around PlayStation 2 like way more it moved so many units that's not
[3486.82 → 3491.58] confusing and the same thing I said the same thing dual shock 2 that's not confusing
[3491.58 → 3499.46] nobody's confused, and they went well yeah but what about dual sense I'm like yeah what about dual
[3499.46 → 3506.20] sense it's got a completely new ergonomic design it has their sense haptic triggers it has a clearly
[3506.20 → 3512.44] differentiating feature, and also it's not called the same thing it's called dual sense it has a new
[3512.44 → 3518.20] name what about steam machine so steam machine's stupid too okay steam machine I don't mind as much
[3518.20 → 3524.92] though because literally not a single one still exists like everyone who bought those put windows on
[3524.92 → 3530.76] it you literally like can't like that that ancient original steam OS that ran on it, they used NVIDIA
[3530.76 → 3538.20] GPUs back then right like that you literally can't even install new steam OS on it steam machine is more
[3538.20 → 3544.20] of a concept which or was more of a concept at the beginning you didn't buy a steam machine you bought an
[3544.20 → 3551.72] alienware whatever part number, and it was listed on steam as a steam machine, so this is a steam this is the
[3551.72 → 3556.44] first first first party steam machine okay so I can at least kind of get behind that I didn't know it
[3556.44 → 3560.92] was like uh there was I remember it was through the OEMS I thought they had a first party one as well okay
[3560.92 → 3567.72] the first party one just went out to press got it to try out steam OS and experience the ecosystem
[3567.72 → 3573.56] but it was all third party so that's not that bad, so this is one of those things where
[3573.56 → 3583.48] the only reason to call something the same thing is to unnecessarily screw up search results which Luke
[3583.48 → 3589.56] managed to demonstrate far more succinctly and easily than I had even thought to do it dude it was I I was
[3589.56 → 3596.60] actually stunned that it came up that way I'm not because this is a serious problem anytime you try to
[3596.60 → 3604.04] fix just to prove the first result is the old one the second, and it says you often visit
[3604.04 → 3610.84] I've only visited today the uh the second result is the new one there is no reason to do this like if
[3610.84 → 3617.80] you've ever tried to find what version of iOS is supported on an iPad if you don't pay super close
[3617.80 → 3625.56] attention, and you know like oh this is the late 2017 one or there's like little tiny letters on the back
[3625.56 → 3630.44] that you can like to pull out a magnifying glass and like search for that specific model, and it's just
[3630.44 → 3637.16] called iPad it's like worthless if you're trying to replace a screen or a battery or a home button or
[3637.16 → 3643.32] whatever the case may be and just find information about the bloody thing that is the only purpose that
[3643.32 → 3649.08] it serves and the really infuriating part of it is that apple knows better for their cash cow for the
[3649.08 → 3655.56] iPhone they all have a clear name that is different from the one before and different from
[3655.56 → 3661.80] the one after they're all clearly named it's its it still fits under clearly named but in my opinion
[3661.80 → 3667.48] they faltered for a second with the x, but then they came back they came they fixed it at least it had
[3667.48 → 3672.60] a name that was not the same as any other I totally agree it just wasn't as good, and then they went back
[3672.60 → 3677.24] to being good again and to and to be clear apple doesn't do everything perfectly in this regard
[3677.24 → 3682.84] either the new see is called 16e instead of just calling it the and the see's were actually kind
[3682.84 → 3688.04] of dumb because they had like see and then see second generation like they have made mistakes I didn't even
[3688.04 → 3695.56] know that, but those are mistakes those are not okay it's never okay and no it was because I could I
[3695.56 → 3700.28] could make the exact same statement we called it steam controller so that it wouldn't be confusing
[3700.28 → 3706.52] I could see the exact same thing we called it steam controller 2 so it wouldn't be confusing
[3706.52 → 3712.60] which of those actually made more sense to you of course yeah yeah i just i I can't
[3713.88 → 3718.92] whenever someone gives you a reason and I use the word reason very loosely here because reason implies
[3718.92 → 3725.00] logic and logic is math whenever somebody gives you a reason for their actions that does not logic
[3725.00 → 3731.48] logic then what it means is either they're stupid or they're lying those are the only answers and i
[3731.48 → 3738.84] don't know what valve's game is here I don't understand this but I don't agree with it and I will never
[3738.84 → 3744.76] agree with it no two products should ever be called exactly the same thing ever speaking of not agreeing
[3744.76 → 3750.68] with it, i I looked up images and references and stuff like that and the USB port does line up with the
[3750.68 → 3757.40] middle of the controller I think that animation that they have is just not correct or maybe the
[3757.40 → 3764.20] magnet is off centred oh yeah it's not plugging into USB port no it looks like the magnet centred
[3764.20 → 3769.16] it's probably just the graphic I wouldn't worry about that that is like the least oh it will bother
[3769.16 → 3775.80] the engagement out of people it will bother people I don't actually remember where it was I'm sure it's
[3775.80 → 3783.00] fine it all looks centred I looked it up yeah yeah hey Philip lane chat seems to be back oh really
[3783.00 → 3789.88] for now maybe for now maybe I'll see how it goes that's fine should we talk about Linus x Linus yeah
[3791.96 → 3795.16] dude it was the best thing ever
[3795.16 → 3806.60] I mean it was weird hearing him say that he was glad that Luke wasn't here I can join don't even
[3809.40 → 3813.96] is this mic on it will be in a second just wait for him to get settled
[3815.48 → 3819.64] want to give it a quick tap for me okay wait I actually do think chat is actually properly back
[3819.64 → 3830.92] now thank you AJ yeah you match nice everyone can you hear okay yeah we we we sprained for the
[3830.92 → 3836.68] headphones give me a hippy tap just on the perfect okay hopefully this isn't too loud let's do this
[3836.68 → 3841.56] thing none of it speaking of having two things named the same there we go yeah how confusing was that i
[3842.52 → 3847.64] I've never really gone through that it was quite funny every single time being like
[3847.64 → 3852.28] hey Linus and then both would turn every single time for the whole day
[3854.04 → 3861.88] did you guys get really hardcore about Linus and Linus no oh he actually doesn't agree with that oh
[3861.88 → 3868.44] it's only Linus if you are speaking Swedish to him that totally makes sense to me otherwise he goes by
[3868.44 → 3874.28] Linus i I called him just because it kind of broke my brain to call anyone else Linus
[3874.28 → 3879.32] except sometimes I think I called him Linus a couple of times well you had asked him about it and
[3879.32 → 3886.44] then you tried Linus for a while then you said Linus then you said Linus you honestly bounced back and
[3886.44 → 3892.36] forth quite a bit between all three it's a hard name debatable it's a hard name very debatable
[3893.40 → 3898.20] where the line can you say the word us I mean you'd be surprised how few people can handle it
[3898.20 → 3905.48] especially in other languages it's very difficult it's very difficult um so I mean dude I don't even
[3905.48 → 3909.00] know I don't even really know where to start with this um if you weren't paying attention, or you're
[3909.00 → 3916.68] just joining the show now we had the one and only Linus Torvalds the creator of the Linux kernel uh here
[3916.68 → 3922.76] to shoot a collaborative video this week we reached out to him saying hey um what do you think would you
[3922.76 → 3930.28] like to do a video together got back the weirdest response ever oh dude it was very strange oh
[3930.28 → 3933.88] awesome you should stop bringing that up and down because it's a lot of mic movement you might just
[3933.88 → 3939.16] have to kind of hold it okay yep sorry sir I could handling noises my bad sir no you're great um cut a
[3939.16 → 3944.68] lot of it out so you probably hear more than they do oh cool um we go linus it's Linus yeah
[3944.68 → 3956.04] so he basically said without accepting or declining well the only way for this to work would be for it to
[3956.04 → 3964.60] um something there can be only one like the hit 80s movie highlander or two men enter
[3964.60 → 3971.56] one man leaves like mad max, and so I basically responded with I don't know what to make of these
[3971.56 → 3975.72] I'm going to give myself the homework of watching these old movies I've never seen and I will get
[3975.72 → 3981.24] back to you which it took me a very long time because I don't find a ton of time to watch movies
[3981.24 → 3987.96] and then eventually I did, and it turns out that he had meant yes yeah we actually found out while he
[3987.96 → 3995.80] was here that he has a very interesting approach to email oh yeah I suspect he has an interesting
[3995.80 → 4000.36] approach to a lot of feel free to participate well i I don't want to interrupt you well no I mean
[4000.36 → 4003.56] yeah you're hanging around late at work to participate why don't you tell the email he's
[4003.56 → 4009.08] very different from our Linus where our Linus might take anywhere between four minutes and four
[4009.08 → 4016.44] business months to respond to an email uh Mr Linus Torvalds has says if I don't respond in 15 minutes
[4016.44 → 4021.40] probably wasn't important anyway, and then you're not going to get a response, and then he archives it
[4021.40 → 4026.44] and he's like if it's important enough don't follow up again and then I'll respond then based so he
[4026.44 → 4030.68] almost responded like within it was definitely within 15 minutes of your original email yeah which
[4030.68 → 4037.08] I was floored by and then what he said was like yeah well it was either that or not and I was like oh
[4037.96 → 4044.12] well I'm glad I was important enough to that I think that's based and then you guys set up a call and
[4044.12 → 4054.36] did some talking and here we are okay out of 10 how cool was it like a 17. Dude like we have some
[4054.36 → 4059.32] footage on your phone of us in the lobby because he gave me the access to his Uber to see like
[4059.32 → 4064.12] whereabouts he was so we could just keep track and I was like watching it like a hawk well first so
[4064.12 → 4068.92] nervous first we were freaking out because he was what half an hour early an hour early oh yeah he's
[4068.92 → 4073.56] like super early so we're sitting there like the set's not ready we're not ready to shoot this Linus
[4073.56 → 4078.68] is still in the middle of a meeting right now what are we gonna how are we going to do this so finally
[4078.68 → 4083.96] about five minutes before he's showing up Linus and I walk down to the front lobby, and we're just
[4083.96 → 4089.08] kind of like pacing back and forth like waiting we're like what do we do how do we open this
[4089.08 → 4094.44] well we were standing on the set and I was like dude what is the point of us trying to play this cool
[4095.08 → 4103.32] we might as well just wait for him on the doorstep because yep we want to yep and uh so maybe that
[4103.32 → 4107.24] footage will make it onto float plane at some point of us just I think there's I do think there's stuff
[4107.24 → 4113.88] coming yeah oh, oh yeah no there's actually uh Sammy already has um there's already something behind
[4113.88 → 4123.16] the scenes up on float plane right now uh let me have a look actually two already uh behind the scenes
[4123.72 → 4129.00] uh shooting the intro for the collab so we ended up uh here's a bit of a spoiler we went with highlander
[4129.00 → 4137.00] there can be only one um so we do like kind of a goofy sword fight thing here are some pictures
[4137.24 → 4143.64] only get samurai swords I unfortunately couldn't get broad swords like the movie yeah yeah um so
[4143.64 → 4150.76] we'll have all that we have all that up on float plane right now um man how can you be that much of
[4150.76 → 4157.72] a chad and still genuinely that humble but also know how important you are oh yeah because he definitely
[4157.72 → 4165.96] knows how important he is or how important his contribution has been, but he's just I don't know
[4165.96 → 4170.84] it was like kind of hanging out with like someone's dad like he's just very down to earth yeah it got
[4170.84 → 4178.12] really comfortable really quickly like we were except me, I asked you I was like was Fallon or this like
[4178.12 → 4184.20] more what were you more nervous for oh this yeah not even close I like Fallon's a celebrity
[4184.20 → 4191.64] but Torvalds in our space is a dramatically bigger deal like we were we were talking about
[4191.64 → 4197.48] it Elijah and i both were like okay well this is it than i I actually can't see any other peak of like
[4197.48 → 4203.32] having a guest do a type of video like have him back the first thing that other people will say is okay
[4203.32 → 4209.24] well what about Bill Gates, and it's like no you got to be kidding me that that was exact response yeah
[4209.24 → 4215.88] exactly not even close it's like why not some why not some other billionaire yeah actually
[4215.88 → 4223.72] though no like this is it was unbelievably cool I think that Gabon would be close for
[4223.72 → 4231.16] me oh for sure Torvalds Gabon you have to go we haven't talked about this topic yet but you have to go
[4231.16 → 4238.04] meet Gabon on his yacht um 364 foot yes please Wozniak oh
[4239.56 → 4246.60] would be very cool but less meaningful to me, i I wasn't into apple like then when he was with the
[4246.60 → 4251.24] company I was like has a lot to do with the introduction of the personal computer he does
[4251.24 → 4257.00] Wozniak it would be super cool that would be super cool but like there's no man there's not you just
[4257.00 → 4261.64] got to email him you got to email him that's all you did for this one, and we got the collab we've
[4261.64 → 4265.56] talked about this after now it's like dude how many cold emails should we just start sending yeah
[4265.56 → 4272.04] i actually I asked him too though I was like i or I don't remember exactly what I said but I was
[4272.04 → 4279.48] like I can't, I basically told him I was like I can't believe it was this easy all i i i I spent my
[4279.48 → 4286.12] entire career obviously knowing who he was how spammed he's going to get now he brought that up he'll just
[4286.12 → 4292.20] ignore it yeah dude he was like yeah basically he talked about how as far as I can tell ignoring
[4292.20 → 4297.08] things is his superpower same as how I can't see ads he just can't see an email he doesn't care about
[4297.08 → 4302.60] and he'll just do he archive himself or does it just auto archive past a certain period of time he
[4302.60 → 4306.20] says he'll archive it I don't know what that means yeah I'm not sure what that means I mean
[4306.20 → 4313.00] all in the column archive it I'm later I'm sure that someone like that could come up with a script
[4313.00 → 4321.08] this is archiving assistant if you really wanted to yeah um but like the i i I basically couldn't wrap
[4321.08 → 4327.16] my brain around the fact that because obviously I've always been aware of the other you know
[4327.16 → 4333.48] the actual tech Linus right yeah yeah yeah and the fact that just me being too shy
[4334.60 → 4340.76] to ask was the only reason it took this long that was the barrier of entry that was the barrier it was
[4341.56 → 4345.80] genuinely so much fun and so cool and like just even walking around the studio with him kind of
[4345.80 → 4350.76] giving him an example of like this is what we do because he didn't necessarily even fully grasp it
[4350.76 → 4356.44] until he was here like what a YouTube media company sure was like right it is weird it's very yeah
[4356.44 → 4360.28] like in the history of media it is very strange and as we kept walking he was like wow this place
[4360.28 → 4366.76] just keeps going like that was like it was cool that he was gent he seemed and i and i I don't
[4366.76 → 4373.08] think he'd bother to pretend, but he seemed genuinely interested did you bring him to the lab I didn't
[4373.08 → 4377.96] we only had a limited amount of time with him, i know we only had a limited we did invite lab
[4377.96 → 4384.12] people over to come meet him though okay yeah um I knew about that but I was I know uh which that will
[4384.12 → 4391.00] be a separate float plane video as well there's kind of like a 15-minute kind of staff it was very
[4391.00 → 4397.00] because i it was after the shoot and I was just like guys just like go up oh dude people were like
[4397.00 → 4401.96] hovering well yeah like I was like honestly he's probably quite used to that
[4403.96 → 4409.88] yeah he wasn't awkward though it's its funny because as part of my prep for this I read his
[4409.88 → 4418.04] autobiography and i um he didn't believe me until like the fourth time I referenced it I think yeah
[4418.04 → 4423.16] you had asked some questions from it or some guiding questions, and he was like oh you actually
[4423.16 → 4431.48] did read the book it was quite funny um so, so yeah in prepping for it so he wrote it over 20 years
[4431.48 → 4436.60] ago though, and he talks a lot about like how much trouble he has with public speaking and how awkward
[4436.60 → 4442.12] he is or whatever and I was like well either he has done a ton since then a lot has changed in 20 years
[4442.12 → 4446.92] or uh you weren't as awkward as you thought you were you hide it well or whatever every time he
[4446.92 → 4452.52] opened his mouth he was very eloquent, and it was fascinating like he's one of those people that's
[4452.52 → 4462.52] just like well there's no way that I'm the smartest person in this room because it's that guy um and it
[4462.52 → 4469.64] was it was just super cool everything he said was just seemed so well considered even if we were kind
[4469.64 → 4474.76] of trying to blind side him with something he still took the time to process it and then like give an
[4474.76 → 4479.96] actually good response and we were like wow okay like we couldn't even trip him we meted him with like
[4479.96 → 4485.64] Xbox versus PlayStation, and he like gave us a thoughtful response, and it's like all right
[4486.28 → 4491.72] yeah it was very great the hardest part about this video I think is going to be cutting
[4491.72 → 4498.20] it into a video and not because there's not enough content there's too much you just gotta dump it on
[4498.20 → 4502.92] flow plane uh speaking of which question from the now working flow plane chat archangel of death said
[4502.92 → 4512.28] did he know about LTT before your email, so this is funny I specifically asked him if he had seen the
[4512.28 → 4518.92] video that we did a number of years ago where we followed the guide from CD net or a parts list
[4518.92 → 4524.76] really from CD net, and we built Linus Torvalds computer like we built the same spec, and we were like
[4524.76 → 4530.52] if you build this you'll have the same pc as Linus Torvalds and I was like have you seen it he's like
[4530.52 → 4541.56] like drew a complete blank but the two other flipping YouTubers that I happened to mention
[4542.20 → 4549.48] okay I mentioned Teddy electro boom yeah yeah immediately he's like oh yeah electro boom awesome
[4549.48 → 4557.64] yeah he's local I'm like okay ego destroyed and then Teddy up and then I should have actually no I didn't
[4557.64 → 4565.00] and then just because I was just kind of i was kind of talking about how it kind of blew his mind
[4565.00 → 4570.92] that we were more of a physical goods company than we are a media company these days and I was like we
[4570.92 → 4574.60] were I was just kind of chatting with them and i kind of brought up that that's not even that unique
[4574.60 → 4582.52] anymore like this creator economy is incredibly cool, and so I pulled out I pulled out this uh this is
[4582.52 → 4591.08] my new box cutter from Evan and Caitlin and um they showed it to me at vidicon and I was just like
[4591.64 → 4598.36] that is too cool for you to give it to me, I will buy one it's super expensive, but it's like extremely
[4598.36 → 4607.32] satisfying you just can't handle it can you up there we go so you slide it forward and then let it go
[4607.32 → 4614.12] yep and then slide it back oh okay yeah I thought you slid it forward again to pull it back no yeah
[4614.12 → 4620.52] super cool um so I showed it to him, and he's like oh yeah those guys they make the like the resin
[4620.52 → 4626.12] pumpkin so you asked him about one of our videos did you ask him about our channel he then acknowledged
[4626.12 → 4633.48] that he had heard of us okay, okay so he didn't completely destroy my ego, but it's just like I pull two
[4633.48 → 4640.36] sort of not random because obviously they're they're tech adjacent and big creators, but he like
[4640.36 → 4647.64] immediately was like oh yeah those guys it was very funny yeah I have to ask you if you can say it
[4647.64 → 4652.84] without spoiling what was the highlight like if you can pinpoint one specific moment
[4652.84 → 4665.56] it's really tough I have one it's so hard because there's like kind of what's a what's a personal
[4665.56 → 4671.48] highlight like the fact that he genuinely thought what we're doing is cool yeah that's pretty sweet
[4671.48 → 4677.24] that was amazing because if he thinks it's cool then it's cool yeah as far as I'm concerned that's
[4677.24 → 4684.84] pretty huge um but like that's a respectable favourite point but like I mean I just thought
[4684.84 → 4691.56] how cool he was also cool like the fact that he's so no I'm serious no I hear you like the fact
[4691.56 → 4699.40] that without a moment of hesitation you know I was like it's totally fine to say no would it be okay
[4699.40 → 4705.40] you have a have some pretty big fans here to hang around longer and just chat, and he was so
[4705.40 → 4713.48] generous with his time during that he didn't have to talk to anybody he waited until like the kind of
[4713.48 → 4719.24] energy died down before being like okay I guess I can head out now he read the room yeah like super
[4719.24 → 4727.80] hard they say never meet your heroes right meet this one but meet this one because he's so cool and
[4727.80 → 4736.92] there was I literally just from the second like he introduced himself it was just I don't know it was
[4736.92 → 4746.28] great vibes yeah yeah yeah and so that was a super huge highlight um i I mean there
[4747.96 → 4754.20] this will be kind of a weird one but getting him to cringe at my dad jokes oh that was so funny was so
[4754.20 → 4760.20] fun yeah you're cracking dad jokes and then him either not immediately realizing it or realizing
[4760.20 → 4766.68] it immediately and going like actually deep sighing he called out your Segways a couple of times which was
[4766.68 → 4771.56] hilarious he's like oh so he does know the channel yeah he was like oh that that was segue yeah
[4771.56 → 4778.52] that was cool very cool um like is that enough is that enough like peak tier highlights for you like
[4778.52 → 4784.12] it goes on and on I have one that I think was my highlight it was after the shoot after the meet
[4784.12 → 4790.20] and greet we went and said goodbye to you yeah uh I candidly was just like I'd be happy to give you
[4790.20 → 4796.52] a ride back to your hotel which was about a 25-minute drive from the office pretty much in completely
[4796.52 → 4802.20] the opposite direction of where my home was but I got a 25-minute one-on-one that's so conversation with
[4802.20 → 4807.40] him that's so sick and like that's something that is going to be forever ingrained even if I have
[4807.40 → 4812.12] another concussion I can't possibly forget that because it's just so cool and that's so sick and
[4812.12 → 4817.48] that's what I mean even too about being generous with his time because he could have just been like
[4818.12 → 4823.08] you know what I'm socialed out today I've done it I've done it I've been like you know what it would be
[4823.08 → 4830.12] fair and that would be totally fine to do that, but instead he's like no I'm going to hang around on set
[4830.12 → 4836.60] and talk to random that I've never met you know or whatever I'm gonna I'll, I'll accept the I'll accept
[4836.60 → 4840.76] the ride because you never know when you accept a ride from someone like you know maybe they try
[4840.76 → 4845.16] and corner you with a business pitch or something like that like totally yeah it happens
[4845.72 → 4851.08] and I could see having your guard up about something like that but whether it's just not
[4851.08 → 4860.12] giving any fucks or whether it's like just being at a point in your career where you're just he was very
[4860.12 → 4866.28] open to new experiences which was once yeah try anything once he said that a lot of times um
[4867.64 → 4874.12] and and and as far as I can tell the try anything once is basically the reason he did it yeah he's
[4874.12 → 4880.76] like I've never I've never done a YouTube video before I've never seen this before and he talked about
[4880.76 → 4888.92] how being the Linux guy has unlocked experiences for him um he talked about going to a premolar party
[4888.92 → 4895.40] he talked about like riding on a fighter jet and just like i I kept kind of ribbing him I was like
[4895.96 → 4900.28] right so that's what you're yeah that's what you're comparing to this right like we're up there we're
[4900.28 → 4912.20] being in a YouTube video right and um I don't know dude i it's just I was more tired after the
[4912.20 → 4921.00] end of that day than I have been after work in a long time not because I was like down about anything
[4921.00 → 4928.36] we were doing but just because being that excited and having that much fun for an entire day is honestly
[4928.36 → 4934.76] pretty tiring yeah I slept for about four minutes before that like night because I was so nervous i
[4934.76 → 4939.96] was in and out of like a dream of like replaying the shoot in my head over and over like wanting to
[4939.96 → 4944.28] make sure everything was going right because obviously i I have my name tied to it so I'm like
[4944.28 → 4953.40] if this is bad I'm bad so um when I got home i also just I was done uh it's over
[4953.40 → 4958.44] well actually I had to post the other valve video if you got home from dropping off Linus Torvalds yeah
[4960.44 → 4965.24] I have no idea how I'm ever going to peak that like maybe I can give Obama or like someone else a ride
[4965.24 → 4972.68] I wouldn't peak it he I know he flashes his phone to me, and he's like how many people have this
[4972.68 → 4977.48] profile picture in their recent message history there's quite a common podcast flex question of
[4977.48 → 4983.80] like who's the most famous person in your phone I now have the most famous person in my opinion
[4983.80 → 4989.00] in my phone that's really cool I'm never ever going to text it because yeah I'm like way too late
[4989.00 → 4993.72] yeah never going to cross that line you have to like frame it oh dude it's somehow got it like a special
[4993.72 → 4999.56] border or something did you right beside him so I'm going to get a screenshot even if someone else that
[4999.56 → 5006.76] someone had in their phone was more famous I think that I think consequential is the word that I would
[5006.76 → 5012.52] sort of apply most to Linus Torvalds because I mean he'll be the first to tell you that the
[5012.52 → 5019.16] Linux kernel these days is like a fraction of a percent code that he actually wrote sure he's mostly
[5019.16 → 5027.56] the guy that that makes sure that everyone else's contributions are are are meaningful and are correct
[5027.56 → 5032.68] and are uh and are and are moving Linux in the right direction moving the kernel in the right direction
[5032.68 → 5038.44] because he's he's he's he's the kernel guy, and he's like yeah at some point i I had to i had to which
[5038.44 → 5047.48] is almost certainly an perfect thing because as with us all unfortunately somehow he's still mortal
[5047.48 → 5054.20] um so he's going to pass at some point yeah, and we're going to need a good example of the types of things that
[5054.20 → 5063.48] he would want to happen but consequential no yeah absolutely like would you I mean like
[5063.48 → 5069.40] think of a celebrity Dwayne the rock Johnson probably more famous than Linus Torvalds oh yeah more
[5069.40 → 5076.84] consequential no yeah like yeah I mean it's like absolutely funny yeah like I can smell what he's
[5076.84 → 5085.08] cooking, but it ain't as important as Linux yeah it's very, very yeah I mean no one watching this is
[5085.08 → 5088.36] going to have a problem with that but I was going to say like if you had a problem with that like please look
[5088.36 → 5095.40] up the amount of things around the world that move because of Linux yeah oh dude the phone the android
[5095.40 → 5105.32] phone in your pocket your prime example mac less so sort of uh less so heavily inspired by um but the
[5105.32 → 5111.16] the android phone in your pocket yes absolutely underpins android like heavily for sure, but you're
[5111.16 → 5114.04] talking about consequence would it exist in the form that is now without it
[5116.92 → 5125.00] because consequence can be indirect and direct okay, okay uh equivocal says no mention of git
[5125.00 → 5129.72] either we did actually talk about git we asked him which was his favourite child that one I'm not
[5129.72 → 5136.52] going to spoil yeah uh so make sure you guys watch this video because the building the computer that's
[5136.52 → 5143.48] the title of the video, but it is the least important part of the video and whether it ends up being a 25
[5143.48 → 5149.56] minute long video or whether it ends up being an hour and a half video we don't know yet uh whatever
[5149.56 → 5155.16] doesn't make it into the YouTube cut is going to end up on float plane but right now Elijah and I are
[5155.16 → 5161.00] leaning towards a super long YouTube cut with uh there will still be some stuff that's just not
[5161.00 → 5166.92] going to make the YouTube cut um so that'll be over on float plane uh but we're leaning towards just a
[5166.92 → 5173.00] long ass video because if it was awesome and it's interesting to try too to see if there's an appetite
[5173.00 → 5180.36] for like you know this kind of long unfiltered podcast almost style videos of just having a genuine
[5180.36 → 5185.48] conversation I don't know if it's going to prove a point though because like yeah because it's yeah
[5185.48 → 5192.28] what does that tell us if we have literally one of the most consequential great point contributors
[5192.28 → 5197.88] to the tech world I love it could, we do an hour and a half long interview with them okay yeah find me
[5197.88 → 5205.08] another one all right I'll go get Bill Gates no I told you i I know that's the thing right like yeah okay
[5205.08 → 5213.16] I told you Gabon okay was and was I'll email him there are some other ones for sure we could
[5213.16 → 5220.44] do one show from his yacht why not right uh oh yeah apparently uh Gabon took delivery of his new 500
[5220.44 → 5226.36] million dollar yacht today yep you guys see that yeah it has a live-in nurse I guess at his age that
[5226.36 → 5231.40] kind of makes sense and also it's not just for leisure it's for like scientific exploration too
[5231.40 → 5238.12] um it has a diving thing and a submarine to do marine life so having I mean Steve Erwin wouldn't
[5238.12 → 5245.48] have minded if uh he'd been working off of a yacht that had on board medical staff but it's not a joke
[5245.48 → 5251.88] yep why is everything a joke with your generation that one's rough well that one's rough please don't
[5253.48 → 5259.80] well I don't know if I don't know if that one will ever not be too soon Steve Erwin oh he was taken too
[5259.80 → 5264.04] soon that's the thing that's the thing it's not that whether the joke is too soon or not too soon
[5264.04 → 5270.28] it said he was taken too soon so it's always too soon forever but I'm sure he wouldn't have minded
[5271.48 → 5276.60] if there was a medical professional closer um so I can see why Gabon would have done that it
[5276.60 → 5283.32] apparently has 15 gaming pcs which is a weird number was a little odd I noticed that to 15 that's got to
[5283.32 → 5289.08] be a typo there's no way it's not eight or 16 three teams of five one at the head of the table
[5289.08 → 5292.76] so what we're playing knights Vikings pirates like what are we even talking about here what are you
[5292.76 → 5298.60] even talking about I don't even think that supports teams of five yeah I got nothing yeah give me a
[5298.60 → 5303.48] five v five people are speculating 14 crew members that would be kind of interesting could you
[5303.48 → 5309.24] imagine just Gabe playing with his 14 he's like all right guys you're off shift we're all going to boot
[5309.24 → 5313.24] up some honestly if you live there completely I wouldn't be too surprised it's pretty cool yeah
[5313.24 → 5317.32] he's talked about how he plays like uh like data and just gets like trolled by people and stuff
[5317.32 → 5326.12] people tell him to uninstall the game and stuff that's crazy amazing um but uh my Starlink latency was
[5326.12 → 5331.80] too bad going back to the Linus Torvalds thing yeah make sure that people know that we had a Reddit
[5331.80 → 5339.08] thread where we asked you guys for your questions we did go through about 10 to 15 is of them again
[5339.08 → 5343.64] don't know if all of them will make it, but some were fascinating some were not but yeah
[5343.64 → 5347.16] some after like you should just go read his autobiography, and then you'll know the answer
[5347.16 → 5353.08] to a lot of the questions you guys asked I'm really glad I read it um we changed the questions about an
[5353.08 → 5358.04] hour before he showed up because it was like oh yeah this would have been really stupid to ask even
[5358.04 → 5363.16] though it's its weird because people might not have read the autobiography so for them, it's really
[5363.16 → 5368.84] interesting to just have this question, but it's also really obvious but I wanted you know our
[5368.84 → 5374.60] contribution to the to totally that was the right way to go yeah I wanted us to be bringing
[5374.60 → 5379.16] something new to the table so even if you're a diehard Linus Torvalds fan you watch every interview
[5379.16 → 5383.80] you can find of him I want you to find something new in ours, and it's not just he's not just a man
[5383.80 → 5388.92] to be milked for content like it's you want it to be decently more interesting for him as well so if
[5388.92 → 5395.16] he's just rehashing things that he wrote down in his autobiography it's like I don't know I wanted him to
[5395.16 → 5402.20] I wanted him to enjoy the experience exactly, and he said it was fine which means we might
[5403.48 → 5412.52] get him back up here yeah dude the fact that he came to us still blows my mind it was so funny that
[5412.52 → 5416.68] conversation because he's like well it makes so much more sense it'd be more effort for me to clean
[5416.68 → 5421.40] up my place to get and get you guys down here, and it'd be so much work for you guys to bring all your
[5421.40 → 5428.36] equipment I want and I'm just like dude your time is not considerate your time and my time are not of
[5428.36 → 5439.80] equal worth like if it takes you an hour then I should be spending hours before we draw a parallel and
[5439.80 → 5447.80] decide what makes sense you know like I think with his do everything once thing though yeah like it was
[5447.80 → 5453.96] probably cool to see the operation yeah I guess i just maybe next time you'll have to go to him
[5453.96 → 5458.92] me standing in a room with him, I have a hard time thinking there's anything cool for him to experience
[5459.88 → 5465.56] you know yeah yeah but then I mean i yeah we're pretty cool it's just it's all relative yeah yeah yeah
[5465.56 → 5473.72] yeah you know, and we're not a fighter jet no we are not a fighter we're not a fighter for sure
[5473.72 → 5480.20] gamer fighter jet stop let's go light sim in a flight the person in the back if they're not
[5480.20 → 5483.08] actively shooting missiles could play like star dew valley
[5485.64 → 5491.32] wow the opposite ends of the spectrum of what you're doing dog fight to star dew valley play this is
[5491.32 → 5495.64] going to be a bit of a niche reference but play spec ops the line in the back of a fighter jet would
[5495.64 → 5501.00] be no one's going to get that but the like four people that get it is'll, it'll, it'll smash with
[5502.44 → 5513.40] amazing um yeah i i I think that is um a few people got it nice there's definitely been points in my
[5513.40 → 5520.84] career that were more consequential like ego wise like the first time we did a million views in less than
[5520.84 → 5525.96] 24 hours on a video like I'll remember that forever it was seven gamers one CPU yeah and
[5525.96 → 5532.60] I'll remember like staring at this view graph going this is unbelievable this is the closest thing
[5532.60 → 5537.08] to a viral video we've ever done it's always been slow and steady this is it this is breakthrough moment
[5537.08 → 5544.04] like I'll remember stuff like that I'll remember you know pacing the family room of the uh the
[5544.04 → 5549.16] old house uh talking to Steve on the phone and finding out we're going to get the channel you know like
[5549.16 → 5556.04] there's there are moments like that in my career that are like core memories but in terms of
[5556.04 → 5564.60] like importance of a video we've made i or like I don't know if it's that important it's like highlight
[5564.60 → 5571.32] yeah like highlight reel career highlight reel this is like it's very high I don't I'm afraid to call it
[5571.32 → 5575.32] number one because maybe there's but then if something's that if something's number one I shouldn't
[5575.32 → 5580.04] forget it yeah, and it's possible that something could take it I think that's okay to look at it
[5580.04 → 5585.80] from that perspective and I'm and I'm talking career like obviously there 's's personal
[5585.80 → 5589.80] life highlights that are bigger than meeting Linus Torvalds like my wife ranks above
[5589.80 → 5594.84] Linus Torvalds you don't have kids debatable oh yeah not debatable what are you talking about
[5594.84 → 5602.68] not debatable you know birth of my children wedding day these are those are maybe close second and
[5602.68 → 5607.72] third you know yeah I know I told my wife I was like sorry honey
[5610.76 → 5614.76] you're moving down to seven, and then she was like yeah you can sleep on the couch and I was like
[5614.76 → 5620.92] understand yeah fair enough sorry but I just drove line in stormy's home so I'm taking my
[5620.92 → 5629.56] little body pillow to the couch cool um yeah anything else you oh right there's something that we wanted
[5629.56 → 5635.88] to present to Luke so he couldn't be here um unfortunately oh yeah you were going to elaborate
[5635.88 → 5642.12] on this yeah why was that Elijah planner of this video sorry what knower of things I might be interested in
[5642.12 → 5648.92] what why um I think there's I texted you uh-huh the Friday before the shoot I think or the Thursday
[5648.92 → 5653.72] before the shoot right that was when he told me the date of the shoot so I had just the weekend to
[5653.72 → 5657.24] because I'd been putting it off to read the autobiography which I got signed by the way
[5658.04 → 5663.48] and the shoot was on Wednesday um I told you I said hey I've done script review that means this is like
[5663.48 → 5669.40] 100 locked in now even though it was already potentially locked in before I said hey it's going to be
[5669.40 → 5675.48] on Wednesday just so you know you just responded with a sad face and then a very uh angry word
[5675.48 → 5679.88] that I won't repeat because I don't have a bleep button um i here we can try and time it all right
[5679.88 → 5688.12] three two I don't know if we that was late for sure that was for sure uh, and then you just said I won't be
[5688.12 → 5697.72] there and then another sad face um and I was like oh I'm sorry buddy today we were talking yeah and I was
[5697.72 → 5703.08] like well technically his flight and everything was booked like three or four weeks ago which is
[5703.08 → 5708.68] the flight is booked you could be pretty sure about when the shoot would be to be fair we weren't
[5709.24 → 5716.04] because of current at the time how some airports were struggling with delays right yeah it was a
[5716.04 → 5723.48] case of we don't actually know um, but you know I probably could have tried to give you a heads-up
[5723.48 → 5728.92] mm-hmm because right about that time is when I locked in the flights for the other thing
[5729.48 → 5734.92] so if I knew I could have no if you were already locking it in then no I could have just not though
[5734.92 → 5741.24] at that time if I knew there was an extremely major conflict sorry I don't know blame Vance he actually
[5741.24 → 5747.80] booked the flights' oh wow you did not just throw Vance under the bus well that's his job
[5747.80 → 5754.76] I can't believe the assistant I'm sorry Vance not only did he do it we double down
[5755.32 → 5762.04] Vance you are very important that's crazy assisting ruining your birthday that's crazy
[5764.60 → 5769.16] he's just not going to book any of my meetings with you now and I'm just I mean that could happen he has
[5769.16 → 5775.32] that power yeah I'm just going to walk into your office he can throw you out he has that power too
[5775.88 → 5780.76] good luck trying I'm pretty heavy I'm sorry no comment
[5783.48 → 5789.80] thanks man I have Vance would call you don't you can't, you can't say this let the record show
[5789.80 → 5797.48] let the record show that I have never explicitly commented so instead it's on video instead of
[5797.48 → 5806.52] it's on video you're commenting on my size all wrong platform height it was the height that I was
[5806.52 → 5813.48] concerned about no I buy that for five dollars you looked at a go-kart, and you said hey do you fit
[5813.48 → 5822.20] right because it was made by a Chinese company that while they did design it for adults they
[5822.20 → 5827.96] designed it is this the one I've sat in they designed it for adults of a shorter
[5829.08 → 5836.04] my bones do not fit inside of it altitudinal stature you have also said on video dang I know you're not
[5836.04 → 5844.60] playing any connect games because you are quite young implying because it wasn't hooked up no
[5844.60 → 5853.48] oh man because the Wii U just says oof because you're quite young you might not have as much
[5853.48 → 5858.60] nostalgia for it, I also want you to know I've cut some jokes from videos because I know if they ever
[5858.60 → 5867.00] hit the platform it would be over oh man anyway we got your float plane sign signed yeah so consolation
[5867.00 → 5874.36] prize um Luke asked us to get his float plane sign signed is that plugged in no oh well we should plug it
[5874.36 → 5879.56] in I mean it has a's proprietary I'm assuming they left it at my desk oh yeah okay that makes sense
[5879.56 → 5884.76] so Luke has a little light up float plane sign, and it is now officially signed by the same person
[5884.76 → 5889.64] it's its exactly the same as the signs that they have at NASA mission control it's made by the same
[5889.64 → 5895.56] person with the same materials that's a very cool artifact, and it is now signed by not only
[5896.76 → 5906.36] Linus Torvalds but also for some reason for some reason that's okay we can wash it off we can
[5906.36 → 5912.04] remove that I think he's always just been too shy to ask so I have been waiting for 15 years do you
[5912.04 → 5920.12] not sign his checks no, no there has been no way for me to get a signature until now so when so
[5920.12 → 5927.64] when Linus signed it I was like you know what I'll sign it too it was that it was so awkward and weird
[5927.64 → 5933.32] of course it was to be fair when I saw you doing this I was like should I stop him because I was like
[5933.32 → 5938.92] and then didn't so it didn't let me know on time so I could make travel arrangements to actually be
[5938.92 → 5945.32] here and then doesn't stop the wrong Linus from signing the sign I didn't want to make a scene
[5945.32 → 5951.56] I was like we can remove it like paint over it you're that guy with the Charlie problem that just
[5951.56 → 5956.04] like doesn't pull the lever to make the obviously better thing happen no I make sure I split the rail
[5956.04 → 5964.52] multi-track drifting this is going to kill one person or seven million so instead of

[5970.52 → 5977.00] autograph i have Linus's autograph on my thing I was getting trolled by nick Harris from the lab the
[5977.00 → 5983.24] entire time he told the Qualcomm people it was my birthday and at dinner they sang happy birthday to me
[5983.24 → 5992.04] which made me just want to die you want to know something crazy I have made it I have made it 39
[5992.04 → 5999.96] years of my life never being sung to in a restaurant that was a stupid thing to say we have to change that
[5999.96 → 6006.44] I will walk out we'll follow you i will definitely hold him in place oh yeah both of us
[6006.44 → 6011.64] no yeah easily no especially how he comments on my son I think you're going to remember this anyway
[6011.64 → 6020.36] uh, uh dude there's like oh there's only 10 000 we're not you we remember if you see him in public
[6020.36 → 6027.96] on his birthday I have to get you back for the sign no yeah that's funny no yeah sign his car
[6027.96 → 6035.48] it should be very funny sorry nick Harris is trolling you okay yeah so it very long work day nick Harris is
[6035.48 → 6040.52] trolling me the whole time as per usual but he just he keeps like threatening that he's going to tell them but
[6040.52 → 6048.20] it's obviously like uh he wouldn't do that, and then he actually did it so at the end of the night
[6048.20 → 6053.32] two Qualcomm people very nice people come up and walk up just to my side and are just like staring
[6053.32 → 6060.12] at me for a second and I'm thoroughly confused I'm like can I help you we're out at dinner uh and
[6060.12 → 6065.80] then I hear the like and I look to my right and there are sparklers, and it's just
[6068.04 → 6073.88] the worst I'm not okay so that was also like oh no day started at eight in the morning we're going
[6073.88 → 6081.00] actually no day started no day started about eight in the morning yeah um working working working
[6081.00 → 6087.00] we get on to the bus while we're moving I'm taking a call we go do stuff while we're on the bus again I'm
[6087.00 → 6092.52] taking another call for most of the dinner I have an AirPods in because I'm in a call the whole time
[6092.52 → 6097.08] like this is a very heavy work day and then right when I get off the call it's a happy birthday singing
[6099.32 → 6103.64] the whole time I'm getting messaged about how cool the Linus Torvalds shoot that I can't be at is
[6105.32 → 6110.44] get back to hotel crash because I'm exhausted get a call at like four in the morning that the forum is
[6110.44 → 6118.52] down so I can't even sleep it was like the worst birthday ever potentially which you know all things
[6118.52 → 6123.72] considered not that it could have been yeah it could have been worse could have been worse yeah that is
[6123.72 → 6128.44] probably my worst birthday yeah you could have we could have had both Linus Torvalds and gay Ben here
[6128.44 → 6133.24] at the studio at the same time you could have missed that that would have been worse I'm going to plan the
[6133.24 → 6144.44] game and shoot when you're gone I will freak out no do it with just Luke yeah with Linus gone
[6144.44 → 6152.20] yeah I think I would lose my job he actually has that power worth it is body language since Dan said
[6152.20 → 6159.48] that is amazing so when I was in a clip please I don't want I should the like aura coming off of Linus
[6159.48 → 6167.56] was so strong I would lose my job not acceptable that was amazing we flew to
[6167.56 → 6173.48] Gabe's yacht for a flow plane exclusive Sammy Elijah Luke
[6173.48 → 6183.16] you might be on a boat but them still dangerous waters boys
[6183.16 → 6188.28] all right didn't Luke miss the last guess yeah I missed all of them as far as I can tell Linus
[6188.28 → 6194.84] purposely plans them I had nothing to do with the dates apparently it's Vance I found out yeah how did
[6194.84 → 6200.04] you hurt him so what I've learned today is that Vance hates me no yeah well it's official I'm posting in
[6200.04 → 6208.76] general about it pings the whole company Vance hates Luke yeah last pasta in twitch chat Linus
[6208.76 → 6214.04] doesn't pull rank often but when he does, it's to not miss a gay band meet and greet yeah you better
[6214.04 → 6219.96] believe it what do you mean not often i I don't think I pull rank that much just trying to start
[6219.96 → 6228.12] I would over this though oh yeah a hundred percent I'd be like no unacceptable it'd be hilarious though
[6228.12 → 6234.36] oh no I'm debating if it's worth losing the job but you have to be kidding me right now I'm going to try
[6234.36 → 6241.80] to send it to Dan, but Nick got the frame that I turned from the people singing to him
[6242.84 → 6250.84] he has the frame of the video the look of betrayal top 10 anime betrayals right because it's its a
[6250.84 → 6257.08] weird moment because I don't want to like obviously I don't want this to happen but I also don't want
[6257.08 → 6263.16] to like to be a jerk to these people that I just met yeah there I sent it to you Dan uh do you want
[6263.16 → 6270.76] that on screen sure yeah um so like I'm trying to like sorry spoilers yeah are you ready yeah sure
[6270.76 → 6279.00] book so I'm trying to like smile and be happy because I don't want to be a big jerk but then I'm also like
[6279.00 → 6299.88] what the hell nick oh no that's way too funny I'm kind of crying a little bit oh man oh no
[6300.60 → 6303.56] so I just got trolled by like the whole world
[6305.56 → 6314.52] I'm sorry I really did wish you could be there i i i I really wanted to bail but like it's its the
[6314.52 → 6318.76] Friday or Thursday or whatever before this thing that's been planned for like a month it's our first
[6318.76 → 6326.20] like thing of this style with them and Ada Ada Ada so it's like Luke's schmoozing and and and
[6326.20 → 6331.72] and for our labs team to get us you know connected with all the right technical people
[6331.72 → 6336.20] to make sure that we can invest it, and it was a great trip stuff and oh yeah no for sure it was
[6336.20 → 6344.52] actually legitimately a great trip so saying would I have rather been here to hang out with like uh you
[6344.52 → 6350.76] know yeah 20-minute drive with him was pretty great trip all righty yeah even I'm a little jealous
[6350.76 → 6356.84] that might have been that was that's very cool to me that is like actually what top one or two
[6356.84 → 6362.36] moments in my life yeah obviously I was joking that's extremely cool yeah, yeah like that's like
[6362.36 → 6369.48] I didn't even I love I didn't even have one on one time with them like we went for coffee I had a
[6369.48 → 6375.00] cookie there's also something about car drives I don't know what it is we talked about like YouTube
[6375.00 → 6379.96] and like how the creator economy works a little bit he talked about like working with his team and what
[6379.96 → 6385.88] that's like yeah working from home probably fast mode um he honestly asked like more questions than i
[6385.88 → 6391.40] got to ask back which I felt was like no this man's asking me about YouTube I was like again I think
[6391.40 → 6395.96] this is part of the try everything once thing and that's very cool to be the potential facilitator
[6395.96 → 6400.84] of that that's still extremely cool because one thing we talked about was the recent ad block
[6400.84 → 6406.60] change that ended up impacting views and how that can impact uh the creator economy from a sponsorship
[6406.60 → 6412.84] side or how that could impact just channel momentum, and he was it seemed very interested in like
[6412.84 → 6418.60] oh that's a change that I could see how ad blockers are just like too but like it really impacted
[6418.60 → 6422.92] it's a huge deal well and I think to a certain degree it's still happening and that's a whole other
[6422.92 → 6431.40] thing yeah very cool all righty I don't want to overstate my welcome thank you for letting me hang
[6431.40 → 6439.32] out, so thanks for nothing yeah I do my best all right see you bye everyone have a good weekend I do my
[6439.32 → 6444.84] best I got it I got it I can take it yeah you're getting no fist bump from him what not after what happened
[6444.84 → 6450.20] I think it's yeah you're still it was still it was resentful I could tell I could tell
[6450.92 → 6457.40] there's not a lot of room back here oh for sure by the way that Ltd 19 shirt though yeah damn it's uh
[6457.40 → 6460.84] been a little worse for wear but for some reason it's one of my favourite shirts all right
[6460.84 → 6467.72] uh we have a couple of uh float plane things that we're supposed to do i I owe Sammy a shout-out for

[6955.80 → 6962.68] a long time yeah I know, so there's some pent-up demand anyway uh since we're live
[6964.12 → 6971.80] I didn't mean to do that it was unintentionally quite good nice quality Linus
[6974.36 → 6978.60] what was I going to say oh yeah right and since we're live now is a great time to place your order
[6978.60 → 6983.48] on LTT store because you can send a merge message all you got to do is add something to your cart and then
[6983.48 → 6988.76] yep whenever we're live there will be a box where you can send a merch message this makes much more
[6988.76 → 6995.48] sense than streaks is that what it's called that's I don't know hype train they did a hype
[6995.48 → 7002.04] train in twitch chat because stop it they did that because we acknowledged them for the first time in
[7002.04 → 7006.60] years and I told them that's dumb and what you should do if you want to throw money at your screen
[7007.16 → 7012.20] I mean by all means use your prime you know membership or subscription or whatever they're called on
[7012.20 → 7017.72] twitch use that one I don't care but don't spend money on that spend money on ltdstore.com where
[7018.44 → 7025.48] whether we acknowledge your message by you know having Dan reply to it there he is or he forwards
[7025.48 → 7030.60] it to someone who can get you a better answer, or he throws it up on the screen like that one that's a bit
[7030.60 → 7034.92] up there, or he curates it for me and Luke to answer you will still get high quality merchandise in
[7034.92 → 7039.88] the mail you can type a message you can be anonymous or have your name show you can change the colour of
[7039.88 → 7046.44] your merch message you will have to opt in to email communication about your message if you have
[7046.44 → 7050.68] a question that Dan can't answer so that is sort of worth knowing, and then you go ahead and place
[7050.68 → 7054.20] your order all right Dan do you want to show us how merch messages works hit us with a couple yeah
[7054.20 → 7060.36] sure we got lots today things are selling quite quickly yep it's that season it is that time of year
[7060.36 → 7066.04] hello LLD I finished my engineering degree next year I'll do my master's degree and I've been working
[7066.04 → 7074.12] for a month on my thesis about outside in tracking with RF what features are relevant here
[7076.44 → 7086.76] what features are relevant here this feels truncated uh potentially maybe uh
[7086.76 → 7093.16] uh I know that the the the new one uses cameras where some of the other ones use
[7093.80 → 7101.16] other forms like the oculus uses a different type, and you mean outside in with the original oculus
[7101.16 → 7107.88] I guess cv1 was camera yes that was cameras and then lighthouses are laser if I remember correctly yes
[7107.88 → 7121.96] um man but then technically light is RF technically isn't it so like uh strange yeah I'm sorry i I think
[7121.96 → 7128.12] this is truncated and I don't know if we're going to be able to answer that in any meaningful way
[7128.12 → 7132.28] darn up next
[7136.92 → 7144.60] okay yes let's do that sorry um favourite Taylor Swift okay you're not going to give them anything
[7144.60 → 7148.44] good oh do you just want to get through this quickly so we can do more topics, and you can go
[7148.44 → 7154.20] home eventually is that what this is about what do you mean I thought we were moving on from that
[7154.20 → 7160.04] merch message did i miss something favourite Taylor Swift i I just mean you this is the
[7160.04 → 7165.40] it's the most important week of leg basically in you know years at this point because we have
[7165.40 → 7171.32] Linus Torvalds here, and we have the huge steam announcement, and you ask me what Taylor Swift song i
[7171.32 → 7176.84] like I mean that's why they hid their name it is anonymous because they don't know how to answer good
[7176.84 → 7181.96] questions you mean ask good questions uh yeah sorry you're the one who doesn't know how to select
[7181.96 → 7186.92] good questions for us to answer I don't I don't know I thought you were a swift I mean you're you
[7186.92 → 7194.68] get the dump truck you share that you're both blonde I have never talked about I would never talk

[7274.68 → 7280.84] don't I don't have time during the day though I'm back on that on what not eating enough on purpose
[7280.84 → 7285.96] oh really I'm back on the reduction train yeah well my wrist is so messed up I can't work out properly
[7285.96 → 7291.24] oh so it's like well time to do the other thing okay fair enough yeah all right I was trying to
[7291.24 → 7296.76] think it was very frustrating for a while and then I was just like you know I'll just cut
[7296.76 → 7302.12] then yeah make lemonade yeah exactly it's fine on say style it's fine I'll make it work yeah and I'll
[7302.12 → 7308.04] just lemonade get back to it when things are better yeah that was more like was that a P. Diddy thing
[7308.04 → 7315.96] I get it hold on I'll be right back one second oh he's gonna he's going to go do it
[7321.32 → 7325.40] I feel like giving someone else a ding just gave him a significant amount of dopamine
[7326.44 → 7331.72] does he need his own bell I was concerned for my uh my dry sweater for a second there
[7331.72 → 7342.28] oh no oh gross how about another one moving on okay let's do one more hi DLL how do you deal
[7342.28 → 7349.56] with issues of sibling rivalry both in your kids for Linus and with your siblings growing up also more
[7349.56 → 7355.48] underwear stock win are we out of stock did we sell them all we sell them stop it so quickly did we
[7355.48 → 7362.52] really all people love them that sucks I wanted some of those i have to start just I'm gonna start
[7362.52 → 7368.76] submitting my dog the larges are out of stock for you would you prefer that no, no i just I feel like
[7368.76 → 7374.76] we should use the like is Luke going to buy it metric because every time I want to buy something on the
[7374.76 → 7380.20] store it's just gone i think I'm going to accost you after the show, and we will sit down
[7380.20 → 7385.40] and just put stuff in there for you maybe uh damn it
[7388.36 → 7397.80] okay anyway um crap yeah medium large and XL are all gone uh oh which store are you on hold on I'm
[7397.80 → 7404.12] on the USA store there's still some more in stock on the USA store I'm on global yeah both designs for
[7404.68 → 7409.24] medium large and XL by the way it's not even just like one of them it's both designs yeah meanwhile
[7409.24 → 7415.56] on the US store it's uh medium large are out for the solid, and it's just large out for the prism
[7416.12 → 7425.40] and confetti design small is also sold out on the solid okay well anyway um of all the problems to
[7425.40 → 7434.28] have yeah no, no no, no no yeah the worst problem i i I know well it's not a good problem no, no it's not
[7434.28 → 7442.28] good, but it's um it's it would be worse if no one wanted it's really hard to find the right balance
[7442.28 → 7447.64] when you're when you're stalking and now that we have multiple distribution centres it's even more
[7447.64 → 7452.12] challenging, and it's only going to get more challenging in the future as like obviously
[7452.12 → 7456.28] you know it's not like it's not occurred to us that it would be good to have a European DC for instance
[7456.28 → 7463.48] I'm getting roasted by flow point chat um oh Seth highland asks what percentage of LTT sales are
[7463.48 → 7470.12] doing wan show less than you'd probably think a fair bit like wan show is a big driver we often
[7470.12 → 7475.16] launch products on wan show so that inflates the numbers a little bit uh but when we don't, it's not
[7475.16 → 7479.56] like we don't have other mechanisms for promoting uh for promoting new products and stuff like that and
[7479.56 → 7486.92] they'll still they'll still be quite strong um no it's its a very serious business for us, I mean i
[7486.92 → 7491.64] think I meant did I mention earlier on the show today that um you got to meet Linus Torvalds without
[7491.64 → 7497.56] me that we're finally doing how does leg spend money oh I don't know if you did or not did I talk about
[7497.56 → 7502.60] it is last week do you guys know about this already okay yeah so basically I've had more exposure to
[7503.40 → 7509.08] you know expense reports in the last week than I probably have in the last five years because i just
[7509.08 → 7515.40] don't really look that closely at that stuff as part of my daily work sure and um the merch
[7515.40 → 7522.20] business is huge like we on inventory we spend millions and millions and millions of dollars a year
[7522.20 → 7535.40] it's crazy um and it's so hard to get it right to not over buy but not under buy especially when I mean
[7535.40 → 7545.64] you go on the store and like almost every product is a bespoke-created product yeah we really have no
[7545.64 → 7552.36] idea I was talking to someone about this recently we really have no idea how to chill with things
[7552.92 → 7560.60] like why would we chill like ever even when it would be totally fine we're like nah yeah nah why would
[7560.60 → 7569.24] we chill let's make a pen but instead of it being a normal pen okay this one is relatively
[7569.24 → 7576.04] low effort by the way that was very cool uh we can't really talk about oh yeah no we can't at all
[7576.04 → 7585.00] or who we were talking to nope but Luke and I got on very like strong authority
[7585.00 → 7594.60] that PTM 7950 is goaded yes like extremely strong pretty much like I can't tell you who it is but the
[7594.60 → 7602.04] the highest pretty maximum strong authority there's god and then there's this individual in terms of their
[7602.04 → 7609.00] authority on this subject it was pretty it was pretty validating I don't know if I disagree yeah yeah
[7609.00 → 7613.64] yep so that was pretty cool um
[7616.52 → 7621.72] oh oh oh my god full plane chat won't leave me alone dude what is this
[7621.72 → 7625.64] oh charged nuclei said, and you let Luke meet them
[7629.16 → 7631.80] just every time you bring up anything
[7631.80 → 7639.64] it wasn't my fault Luke I didn't know no I know it was the person who recently left I know
[7639.64 → 7643.88] i really i I would have fought for you if there was anything that could have been done you know i
[7643.88 → 7647.40] would have paid for you to get a flight back I knew it was upcoming but legitimately until that i
[7647.40 → 7651.88] think Thursday I had no idea it was like the next week I know I'm sorry that it was way too late
[7651.88 → 7659.56] I mean it is what it is but at least you have that sing that is actually really cool from both of us
[7661.80 → 7670.20] because that sign is like one of my favourite things and then yeah I'm surprised you don't like the one for the wall more
[7670.20 → 7673.80] no that's super cool oh I thought you like gave it back to me or something didn't you
[7674.92 → 7680.20] I think no you asked me to store it yeah because you didn't have anywhere to put it yes yeah okay never mind and I still
[7680.60 → 7687.08] don't and I still have the plane too I'm still like holding on to that for you that's yours that's not mine I don't like to want it forever
[7687.08 → 7693.64] Luke do you ever in a cool way though do you ever display the one of one thing that you have that I gave you
[7694.76 → 7700.76] from the place with the people that's secret good okay yeah, yeah very you've seen it
[7702.20 → 7708.52] uh it is unravels like that oh that yeah yeah yeah you should never show anyone that
[7708.52 → 7715.96] that is private yeah very private um all right uh what are we supposed to what was
[7715.96 → 7722.52] the word very behind um right sibling rivalry yeah how do I put this uh how do I put
[7722.52 → 7729.48] this lightly i i I don't really feel any rivalry with my siblings we've um you have to not put how do
[7729.48 → 7734.12] I put this lightly first well no I don't put how do I put this lightly first then that statement is
[7734.12 → 7738.20] totally fine I think people could take it the wrong way though I think by putting how do I put this
[7738.20 → 7742.92] lightly before it people will now take it the wrong way oh no if you just didn't say that it would have
[7742.92 → 7748.44] been no, no offence but I actually have a pretty healthy relationship with my family yeah no
[7748.44 → 7754.68] point is that we have none of us have tried to achieve even remotely the same things as my siblings
[7754.68 → 7763.24] have zero interest in being an online influencer across the board zero so like how do you how do you
[7763.24 → 7773.08] measure that kind of yeah like there's no rivalry there yeah um and like it's also yeah like wildly
[7773.08 → 7782.28] different types of success um yeah and I mean it's like if I'm looking at my like sibling rivalry I think
[7782.28 → 7790.60] my brother has achieved very immense levels of success in very different things he got the exact career that
[7790.60 → 7795.40] he wanted yep in the exact way that he wanted it and is excelling with it seems to be nailing it on
[7795.40 → 7799.96] the family side nailing on the family side pun intended he's got a couple kids he's got yeah yeah
[7800.60 → 7806.36] and that's all going pretty well sorry rich little graphic, but you won't mind I know
[7807.48 → 7813.96] uh so like i yeah i I don't see any I hear what you're saying it's completely different realms yeah yeah
[7813.96 → 7820.84] yeah Luke informed me you're good at it in ways that make sense to him and to you but not to the
[7820.84 → 7829.32] audience right now so no further elaborate extremely weirdly I almost feel like I need to explain that
[7829.32 → 7834.68] now I'm uncomfortable I don't think you can, I don't think you should we've got Linus's thighs and now this
[7834.68 → 7843.32] what's going on I don't think you can the success rate was high it's like the chicken no it's not like the
[7843.32 → 7847.32] our family's just it's not like the chicken it's nothing like chicken
[7851.32 → 7853.40] chicken is chicken in not
[7856.28 → 7860.36] chicken pregnant I mean you could check on I think that's allowed
[7860.36 → 7865.16] the chicken is
[7865.72 → 7867.32] and we're cooked
[7870.12 → 7873.32] why did Linus Torvalds ever agree
[7875.48 → 7881.24] because he never heard of our channel never seen the wans show there's no way there's no way he's ever
[7881.24 → 7886.36] seen the wans show i actually specifically asked him if he looked into any like controversies around us and
[7886.36 → 7894.20] he said he explicitly doesn't oh which used to be my policy I'm happy that hasn't bitten him in the butt
[7894.20 → 7902.84] and then I collabed with Hassan and collabed with um too mad and I was on a bit of a streak there for
[7902.84 → 7910.28] a bit yeah yeah I do really hate where like if is there's is there's literally any level of like
[7910.28 → 7914.92] contact people assume that you've like done deep dives on everyone around like that's insane and
[7914.92 → 7920.44] needs to stop but that you agree with them on everything yeah now literally every single thing
[7920.44 → 7925.16] they've ever said you now full-heartedly agree with yep like there's people I know and I'm friends with
[7925.16 → 7930.20] where I can name a multitude of things that I don't agree with them on like that I feel like
[7930.20 → 7936.52] that should be fairly normal but anyway that's a whole other topic lets oh yeah PVC there you go nice
[7936.52 → 7945.64] and to be clear I'm not saying that I like hate those people or whatever I'm just saying that have
[7945.64 → 7951.08] been controversial figures I didn't research them at all and I didn't realize that they were quite
[7951.08 → 7957.08] polarizing yeah that's all I'll say yeah because that's all that needs to be said I think we came
[7957.08 → 7963.56] out of those fairly unscathed yeah I think so I think so yeah I think the one that there was the
[7963.56 → 7969.24] most concern about was too mad yes and I was just like yeah what he bombed some Zoom calls at that
[7969.24 → 7975.64] point I think he got more controversial later I think that's true we also kind of i think
[7975.64 → 7983.08] I think all of those figures I think every single collab in that collab streak has become
[7983.08 → 7988.12] more controversial over time I think that's true but I think they were people who that was
[7988.12 → 7997.00] to a certain degree their shtick so it was somewhat inevitable I think yeah I'm actually
[7998.12 → 8001.96] x I can't tell oh my god AJ
[8005.32 → 8013.72] come on did you make it admin only don't add more admin only emotes did he seriously add the
[8013.72 → 8020.84] being upset about the birthday song I absolutely did not send it to him on teams so that he could
[8020.84 → 8027.56] do that oh my god this is amazing uh oh you probably oh you probably need that new command
[8029.64 → 8036.20] what's the're going to need a new command um what is what is the command for clear cash
[8036.20 → 8049.08] uh with a capital c how do I type how do I type this oh yeah the spam has begun cash cleared no, no no
[8049.08 → 8054.76] no, no the first c is lowercase the second key is c is capital oh everybody's doing it wrong my bad
[8054.76 → 8059.08] I said it I said it poorly the for it's its clear all lowercase and then capital c
[8059.08 → 8070.52] cash yeah all right c-a-s-h um as for sibling rivalry with my kids do this I think we why would
[8070.52 → 8075.96] you do this people are actually doing it why would you do that that's great that's that's how I get all
[8075.96 → 8082.28] their money from LTT store they type clear cash it all comes to me, they clear their cash it re-ups
[8082.28 → 8088.52] their subscription yeah every single time um yeah this is the real hype train as for kids uh
[8088.52 → 8095.40] same thing my kids don't aspire to the same things as they're they're very, very different I'd say
[8095.40 → 8100.76] that with the daughters it's its something that we're going to be paying more and more close attention
[8100.76 → 8106.20] to as they like hit puberty and stuff, and they start to your know think about body image and stuff
[8106.20 → 8111.56] like that but so far it hasn't really been a major issue like it's not like it's not like my
[8111.56 → 8119.56] daughter's care that my son's team went 36 and 0 for volleyball this year based the uh the gym coach
[8119.56 → 8130.52] who's been there long enough to um long enough that oh how do I say this doesn't help you oh uh
[8130.52 → 8135.24] basically she's been there a very long time, and she said to her knowledge no team at the school has
[8135.24 → 8141.32] ever had an undefeated season in any grade in any sport which was pretty cool
[8141.32 → 8146.60] so they went completely undefeated this year that's epic um just swept everything they
[8146.60 → 8151.32] unfortunately there were no provincials for his grade volleyball this year oh, but there will be
[8151.32 → 8156.04] at higher grades, but there will be at higher grades so he's um so he's he's getting pretty he's getting
[8156.04 → 8161.96] pretty into it, I told him don't forget about badminton don't forget to play with me sometimes
[8161.96 → 8171.64] people are typing slash loud yeah that'll just unlock everything that makes sense and I don't
[8171.64 → 8178.04] know when more underwear stock is coming I'm sorry okay we should move on to a new topic Microsoft exec says
[8178.04 → 8187.72] windows is evolving into an agentic OS and gets cooked in the replies good although in fairness
[8187.72 → 8194.68] Windows 11 start menu does seem like it's getting a pretty good redesign how's that in fairness i
[8194.68 → 8200.68] mean they're doing something positive I think it's but also sure Microsoft's current head of
[8200.68 → 8206.84] windows Pavan failure posted on x to say that the future of the platform is one that is evolving into an agentic OS
[8206.84 → 8214.60] the tweet has seen pushback with various opinions pretty much all stating the same thing nobody wants
[8214.60 → 8219.48] to use windows primarily through an AI middleman the windows start menu is receiving its first
[8219.48 → 8225.80] significant makeover since 2021 and will be delivered to all users as part of the November 11th update I do
[8225.80 → 8230.76] like it more the menu is now scrollable uh here do you want to sure so you can move through your apps
[8230.76 → 8235.88] in one place and the interface is now larger with a responsive layout that adapts to the screen size
[8235.88 → 8244.44] automatically however you cannot resize it manually for comparison yeah the start settings page is
[8244.44 → 8248.84] being updated and will no longer feature the layout option if you disable all the recommended settings
[8248.84 → 8253.48] you'll also have the ability to hide the recommended section of the start menu which honestly is probably
[8253.48 → 8258.84] good I don't need recommendations for what it was that I was hoping to open right now because you have
[8258.84 → 8266.84] no way of knowing that um I'm going to kill our discussion question here we're just gonna kind of move on
[8266.84 → 8273.64] because yeah that's all I think I really feel the need to say about that oh this one doesn't have a
[8273.64 → 8284.84] header so I can't collapse it downer um Luke you want to pick one sure uh let's talk about Ubisoft oh no
[8284.84 → 8293.00] I just feel like you're doing a throwback to the old house keep on digging keep on digging yeah we
[8293.00 → 8299.40] had this thing on wan show it's been a very long time when there was just it felt like every week yeah
[8299.40 → 8305.32] six months like I don't know how long it was a long time it was a long time just every week
[8305.32 → 8311.40] every other week at least there was some terrible news out of Ubisoft, or they were doing something
[8311.40 → 8317.08] awful which was insane because that was also at like a pretty fairly peak time for Ubisoft that was
[8317.08 → 8322.12] like assassin's creed 4 and like all these like huge like their games are doing well
[8322.12 → 8327.32] but they were just doing really horrible things yeah or like the launch would be super buggy and
[8327.32 → 8333.00] they'd fix it later, but it was just like unnecessary floating eyeballs and stuff yeah that was like
[8333.00 → 8337.00] slightly later than what I was talking about but definitely still during keep on digging yeah so we
[8337.00 → 8341.56] we even made a shirt it had a shovel on it nick van Burke designed it that was back when just like
[8342.28 → 8346.84] we didn't have designers we just had our video editors who had some familiarity with like talented
[8346.84 → 8352.44] people yeah the adobe suite so anyway yeah all right what's up with Ubisoft right now Ubisoft delayed
[8352.44 → 8358.60] it's half year earnings report which is a huge deal for public companies and requested halted trading
[8358.60 → 8365.56] until its release on Thursday November okay we're moving stuff around on thursday, November 13th the day
[8365.56 → 8373.80] Ubisoft was to release it's half year yeah the day of crazy uh was to release it's half year 2025 2026 earnings report
[8373.80 → 8380.04] the company instead announced a delay and requested a halt to the trading of its shares and bonds
[8380.68 → 8389.40] on euro next all right uh and gash it says delays to earning reports may happen due to accounting issues
[8389.40 → 8398.04] but speculates halting trading of the company's shares could portend major news such as a sale or Ubisoft
[8398.04 → 8406.60] becoming a private entity again oh interesting uh Tencent recently took a 25 stake of new Ubisoft subsidiary
[8406.60 → 8412.20] vantage studios which now manages the company's major titles like assassin's creed far cry and rainbow
[8412.20 → 8420.76] why would they do that that's weird because they want to own gaming no why would Ubisoft split
[8420.76 → 8431.88] off their major titles into a sub brand because Ubisoft is f***ed oh so sink the bad ship move everything
[8431.88 → 8439.32] else off and do an okay all right makes sense uh there was talk of Tencent taking Ubisoft private last year
[8439.32 → 8446.36] yikes uh this follows contract buyouts for some employees of the company just last month this is
[8446.36 → 8453.80] the kind of like financial finagling that means that no matter how poorly managed a company is once it's
[8453.80 → 8457.88] big enough it almost feels like there are no consequences for the leadership because they can just
[8458.84 → 8468.12] make moves and then yeah keep shovelling money into the sacks of money that they sleep on presumably like
[8468.12 → 8474.68] yeah the individual developers will suffer in all of this like sort of reorg acquisition nonsense but
[8474.68 → 8478.76] the actual the leadership that put them in a position where they weren't profitable enough to
[8478.76 → 8487.32] just keep doing what they were doing in the first place if anything will probably benefit i uh yeah i
[8488.60 → 8493.16] I saw a comment go by about this but I also had the thought and i and I lost the comment so I can't
[8493.16 → 8502.28] say the person's name so sorry but um video game industry Canada yikes oh yeah Ea is now purchased
[8502.28 → 8510.44] yep Ubisoft is well let's see but clearly something funky something yeah, yeah star eye says china Ubisoft
[8510.44 → 8519.16] and Saudi Ea crazy times pretty much yikes uh we should probably do sponsor spots at some point
[8519.16 → 8525.16] here this is ooh or not carry on not you can go for it, I was going to have a conversation about like the
[8525.16 → 8530.28] industries that you can get into in Canada and how that's like I had a conversation on a recent trip
[8530.28 → 8535.24] about um okay I didn't realize arena
[8538.28 → 8538.76] radio
[8538.76 → 8546.92] oh
[8546.92 → 8547.00] oh
[8549.16 → 8556.36] oh yeah wasn't it imaging didn't they like to acquire that IP or something from AMD and hold on there was
[8556.36 → 8563.88] some speculation that they might have acquired some part of ATI uh imaging previously ATI imaging was a
[8563.88 → 8570.60] series of media coprocessors hold on produced by ATI later amd later sold it to
[8570.60 → 8576.12] Qualcomm in 2009 yeah, yeah so that's where arena comes from I actually didn't realize that that was
[8576.12 → 8582.28] where arena came from had no I thought imaging was a cooler name uh personally imaging's pretty cool
[8582.84 → 8590.04] yeah but yeah anyway arena comes from there uh but ATI was Canadian for people that don't know
[8590.04 → 8598.36] we also had um nor tel blackberry a lot of our but yeah sure yeah a lot of our used to be able to
[8598.36 → 8603.32] get a rim job in Canada no problem now there are no rim jobs we even exported room jobs
[8606.04 → 8613.72] uh but yeah a lot of our tech has been bought and moved away yep now our gaming industry is being
[8613.72 → 8619.88] bought and moved away, and it's like what do you go to school for to get into industry for in
[8619.88 → 8627.08] Canada now there is still a lot of stuff you get into medical care that is a yeah that is
[8627.08 → 8633.56] a space that is getting worse over time um and that's not good and I hope we start doing things
[8633.56 → 8640.28] to start uh float plane chat you got to get your mind out of the gunner okay it's research in motion
[8640.28 → 8647.32] job yeah what are you talking about grow up what are they even talking about grow up what is it though
[8647.32 → 8653.00] I'm not going to tell you your virgin mind cannot
[8655.64 → 8662.92] virgin tongue anyway I'm sad about this there have been oh wow uh there are a lot of
[8662.92 → 8669.64] Ubisoft games that I've really loved over the years um ANO is fantastic I've been a huge fan of the
[8669.64 → 8675.08] assassin's creed line uh a bunch of the especially I don't know how much credit Ubisoft can take for ANO
[8675.08 → 8683.56] uh yeah sure fair enough yeah like that team's been around killing it since like the 90s and as far
[8683.56 → 8688.84] as I know they're they're like kind of isolated yeah Ubisoft just publishes for them as far as I can
[8688.84 → 8696.36] tell oh I didn't actually realize it was that separated my bad um I know I thought they were a thing within
[8696.36 → 8704.68] but I don't I've not like looked this up um oh apparently some ANO games have been developed by
[8704.68 → 8711.48] Ubisoft blue bite German video game holding company owned by Ubisoft was founded in blah blah blah so i
[8711.48 → 8717.48] thought they were just all max design uh I didn't realize there was even two so I don't know
[8717.48 → 8726.44] oh no defunct 2004 okay yeah it shows you what I know actually uh okay nope wait by sunflowers
[8726.44 → 8734.76] in collaboration with related to max uh based in claiming uh, but company is best known for
[8734.76 → 8739.16] creating the ANO series the company was closed down in 2004 okay yep shows you what I know then in a
[8739.16 → 8745.16] while uh but anyway they've made a lot of games that I have really loved uh but the way the company
[8745.16 → 8751.24] has been run has always been highly questionable hence the old keep on digging memes uh the creation
[8751.24 → 8758.68] of Ubisoft connect or whatever the heck it's even called now you play um was pretty whack
[8760.36 → 8762.36] there's been a lot of things that have just been like
[8765.88 → 8772.84] not great so I'm not surprised they're in a tough spot, but it sucks to lose even more Canadian
[8772.84 → 8777.56] industry and I understand like it's not like Ea just like deleted their offices in Canada or
[8777.56 → 8785.08] anything but I wouldn't be surprised if the focus shifted yeah I know it's about as Ubisoft as it gets
[8785.08 → 8793.40] it looks like developer for no 1800 is Ubisoft blue bite yep so it's its first party yep sorry about
[8793.40 → 8799.80] that uh max design only did the first two back in 1998 and 2002 make sure get that right for you guys
[8799.80 → 8810.28] I didn't play those oh so yeah I was honestly mostly sad hey you know what you could

[9019.00 → 9027.00] complete it will reveal the end of that tale they are absolutely packed with little kind of Kasper
[9027.00 → 9033.00] eggs things that you can find little differences between the guide and the finished picture, and it was

[9056.44 → 9062.60] goodies yeah it was a lot more I mean some people enjoy the puzzle for the sake of doing the puzzle
[9062.60 → 9067.88] but i have to say for me, it was a bit more fun it was more interactive anyway with my kids it comes
[9067.88 → 9071.72] with kind of like a checklist of things that you can look for and things you can talk to them about
[9071.72 → 9073.64] after the fact so it's not just like okay it's done
[9076.44 → 9080.92] now we crumple it all back up and put it into the box um some people and for some people that's enough
[9080.92 → 9086.04] but if it's not or if you just are kind of looking for something different um Black Friday's kicking
[9086.04 → 9092.04] off with up to 40 off odd pieces just go to odd pieces.com slash wan show and use code wan show for
[9092.04 → 9097.40] another 15 off if it's your first order okay that's a pretty deep discount go check it out

[9109.88 → 9118.20] wan show the audience you know i really yeah you really yeah one time wow I want us to start
[9118.84 → 9127.56] relatively close to one time and go past midnight one time why I'm not saying it has to be now that's
[9127.56 → 9131.72] too long do you need a why to listen to wan show for that long it's not about that literally nobody
[9132.84 → 9137.08] look how many people have tuned out already see the graph it's gone down they're they're bored they're
[9137.08 → 9142.60] tired of us and I don't blame them that's okay look at us, it's okay it's an it's its another
[9142.60 → 9149.40] podcast with a bunch of white dudes a lot of the same flavour of ice cream it's a vanilla just a lot
[9149.40 → 9154.92] of vanilla it's just the colour of the hair in your vanilla ice cream do would you like darker
[9154.92 → 9156.60] hair in your vanilla ice cream and a lot
[9156.60 → 9164.92] yeah there's so much why is there so much hair in this ice cream
[9167.16 → 9173.08] it's entirely too much it's mostly hair with some vanilla you mean none of them are balding and they
[9173.08 → 9179.88] all have beards what's happening right now um my question is where should the hair come from
[9180.68 → 9189.08] is it time to get an office cat yeah I went to grab a granola bar from the cupboard before the
[9189.08 → 9197.56] wan show today and my first two attempts the package had been opened by what appeared to be rodent teeth
[9197.56 → 9202.92] yeah did I tell you about the one time I took a meeting on the wan set no I had to get a meeting
[9202.92 → 9207.16] a meeting with Taryn went a little bit long yeah so I couldn't make it over the lab I needed somewhere to
[9207.16 → 9211.56] sit I checked the conference room taken I don't have time to just keep checking all
[9211.56 → 9215.32] the different areas so I just ran out of the wan set because I knew it would be free I had a meeting
[9215.32 → 9222.92] here I had to take a picture really quick for the wan hoodie and I picked up that sign you're a plus sign
[9222.92 → 9228.04] and held it in front of me and there was I think three spiders on the back and they just left me alone
[9228.04 → 9232.28] so I just held it with them there put it back then while I was taking the meeting sitting on the set
[9232.28 → 9240.44] I saw not one but two different mice running around the set we could use a cat we could maybe
[9240.44 → 9247.64] use two cats one for each building or for each major building so we used to have an employee that
[9247.64 → 9253.64] not only was quite allergic to cats but not willing to overcome it like not into cats got it
[9254.36 → 9257.96] I think we would have to maybe this could be a subject for the all hands on Monday
[9257.96 → 9264.76] maybe we could maybe we could just basically go is anyone going to health reasons veto a cat
[9265.48 → 9272.20] well we can't do that in public we'd have to allow them to do it privately give us let us know yeah let
[9272.20 → 9278.68] us know yeah, but otherwise we think we should, we think we need some we could use something
[9279.32 → 9286.84] i the lab is infested by flies it's been the solution for thousands of years yeah at this point you
[9286.84 → 9292.20] you know little houses that they go into or whatever we're reinventing the wheel is a cat
[9292.20 → 9295.96] yeah so okay all right I'm i
[9299.24 → 9305.48] at this point I'm looking at it going okay and if someone does object to it, I think I would want to
[9305.48 → 9310.44] kind of talk to them and go okay well like here's the issue like are the allergies worse
[9310.44 → 9316.68] then because we clearly can't get the rodents under control maybe and maybe and maybe the answer
[9316.68 → 9321.40] could absolutely be yes and that would be fine yeah it depends on the severity yeah but are the
[9321.40 → 9327.32] allergies worse than the risk of like rodent infestation being a health hazard because we've
[9327.32 → 9331.88] we've tried we've got traps freaking everywhere that's pretty, but they are, but it's a huge space
[9331.88 → 9338.12] and literally ran past one so much clutter I was trying to get a video to prove that I saw two
[9338.12 → 9342.52] separate mice on the Sancho set and while trying to film them which I failed to do because they
[9342.52 → 9348.68] were quick um I didn't think of it fast enough I saw one of the traps that they've just very clearly
[9348.68 → 9358.04] ran past yeah all right I think it's uh I think it might be time uh arrays says ferrets are better
[9358.04 → 9365.72] mousers and are rarely an allergy concern yeah but they stinky yeah stinky litter box um whereas cats are
[9365.72 → 9369.88] we could get a couple robot litter boxes there are a few people that have said that would be a bad
[9369.88 → 9375.24] idea but I haven't seen a single person say why I do have calories, and it can cause massive long-term
[9375.24 → 9382.20] issues massive long-term issues I've never heard of a cat allergy causing long-term issues yeah
[9382.20 → 9386.84] neither of us know what's going on, so this might just you know not able to be a thing yeah and if it's
[9386.84 → 9391.16] not able to be a thing then it won't be a thing keep having mice, or we'll put out more traps or
[9391.16 → 9398.04] maybe both yeah um could you get one of those hairless ones oh it's the hair that I'd be so
[9398.04 → 9402.20] done we could get a peter bald isn't it the like dandruff or whatever that's usually the issue dander
[9402.20 → 9408.28] uh but they apparently have like way less yeah peter bald let's go
[9408.28 → 9412.84] right hyper energetic apparently you can also give them food which reduces it so maybe you get one of
[9412.84 → 9423.32] these and the food peter bald good look at him ah it's the saliva not the hair wouldn't that make
[9423.32 → 9426.84] it is easier to deal with it yeah because they don't have to lick themselves as much I think the
[9426.84 → 9436.20] hairless ones um peter bald I don't know what's going on um they are not truly hypoallergenic because
[9436.20 → 9440.68] the blah blah blah well their lack of fur can mean less shedding and therefore fewer airborne allergens a
[9440.68 → 9444.68] person with a cat allergy can still have a reaction to the proteins in their saliva this is all AI though
[9444.68 → 9452.52] so who knows um there are breeds that are supposed to have less um I like Elijah's plan can we give
[9452.52 → 9460.12] everyone a gun to shoot the mice this isn't Texas that's a day air gun it's Canada we'll give them a
[9460.12 → 9467.32] rifle yeah as long as it's under 495 feet per second sure no problem they're going to test it is it 495 i
[9467.32 → 9473.00] can't remember I don't know paintball guns carat said I'm omega allergic to cats will break out in
[9473.00 → 9477.88] hives I imagine other people are as well yeah it's possible surprising to me how common that is
[9479.48 → 9485.56] interesting apparently um allergies like kind of had like a peak when we were kids and apparently
[9485.56 → 9492.44] some of them are actually declining now like peanut allergies uh are on the decline now because um
[9492.44 → 9497.72] um parents are being encouraged to expose their kids earlier or something I was reading about that
[9497.72 → 9503.24] the other day pretty wild yeah dude this is such a crazy fact uh try lumen in full plane chat, so there's
[9503.24 → 9507.88] no rats in Alberta have you seen the rat population map of the world yeah it's pretty funny it's nuts
[9507.88 → 9513.00] I actually brought that up with Linus Torvalds his comeback was oh even rats don't want to live there
[9514.04 → 9520.60] I was like wow damn shots fired he seems funny I've seen some of his stuff oh yeah he's hilarious oh
[9520.60 → 9532.92] uh there we go there's just an Alberta sized hole book incredible oh yeah wow I did have it right
[9532.92 → 9544.04] 495 fps is the below uh maximum until it's considered a firearm in Canada neat um hey I love this
[9544.04 → 9548.52] this website that I found cities without rodents in the world Alberta Canada
[9554.92 → 9564.68] not a city but okay good try yeah solid effort yeah oh man uh google will allow experienced users
[9564.68 → 9571.40] to install android apps that were made by unverified developers google is walking back their plan to lock
[9571.40 → 9576.12] downside loading on android it's good news in August the company announced that starting next
[9576.12 → 9581.88] year android users would only be able to install apps made by verified developers now google is saying
[9581.88 → 9587.24] that experienced users will still be able to install apps from wherever they want, although it will take
[9587.24 → 9593.24] a few extra steps and a handful of warnings google claims that the idea here is to curb malware without
[9593.24 → 9599.96] completely shutting the door on android's openness the change appears to be a response to heavy pushback
[9599.96 → 9606.52] from developers industry groups and everyday users who just didn't love google deciding what trusted
[9606.52 → 9613.64] means good reason um disgusting question here is how do you combat companies just arbitrarily determining
[9613.64 → 9619.40] what an experienced user is yes trusted app because that's the one thing where I said what does it mean
[9619.40 → 9623.40] is what are experienced users experienced user means that you can navigate
[9623.40 → 9630.60] you can navigate some prompts like basically what I'm imagining because they've already got warnings
[9630.60 → 9635.64] so I'm imagining that maybe you have to do something that's like kind of hidden like the tap five times
[9635.64 → 9641.88] to become a developer or whatever thing that's i I'm imagining right now overall I see this as a positive step
[9641.88 → 9646.12] and I'm going to try not to be pessimistic about it, you have to get those braces fixed man
[9648.28 → 9653.32] when can you when can you get it done how long is it going to be what am I supposed to do what would
[9653.32 → 9660.04] you have me do get the is it just the rubbers is it even that what is going on what is
[9660.04 → 9669.48] effect what is this do not put rubbers in my mouth hmm what is it at least not unaccompanied wow, wow
[9669.48 → 9675.72] who is it so right now I don't wear those this is dentist
[9680.36 → 9685.72] you have one that isn't discoloured in the middle of two that are discoloured so I can explain that
[9687.00 → 9695.32] I can explain that so right now um they are I have a stronger bar in the top than I did a week ago they
[9695.32 → 9703.88] put like a thicker one in and um in order to keep my teeth from separating like shifting apart okay
[9703.88 → 9709.64] they put what's called a power chain on it and basically sick I know right uh instead of individual
[9709.64 → 9715.80] elastics it's a chain of elastics that holds the bar in place and also keeps the teeth together so
[9715.80 → 9721.56] that's across the front um the power chain is not available in all the like fun colours that you can put
[9721.56 → 9725.88] on if you get the individual ones as far as I know anyway I actually didn't ask I've just been putting
[9725.88 → 9730.60] on the clear or the white ones up until now but what's actually causing the discolouration problem
[9730.60 → 9737.72] oh yeah, so the white ones will discolour especially with um very colourful food, so the issue is that i
[9737.72 → 9743.24] had nothing but curry for three days so which is wild uh well we actually we ordered too much and my
[9743.24 → 9748.52] kids didn't want it so what I'm going to do throw it away I waste it would, you have me waste chicken no oh
[9748.52 → 9755.08] no that's what I'm talking about especially not now and I ate all the chicken good so the chicken
[9755.08 → 9766.52] was consumed thank yeah exactly 100 success eating the chicken um in addition to that I have clear
[9766.52 → 9773.64] chicken sorry I have this uh I have this like uh semi-permanent wax like glue kind of thing that they
[9773.64 → 9780.36] they uh paint on top of these brackets, and then they cure with an UV light it seems to be pretty
[9780.36 → 9788.76] susceptible to curry stain and that's why this one fell off oh wait so it's not the power thing so that
[9788.76 → 9794.52] will turn colour yeah as well but I've only had that for a week so it's actually the glue that's on top
[9794.52 → 9804.52] oh and if I don't wear it um these ceramic brackets they sit super proud off the tooth and uh I don't
[9804.52 → 9810.52] think yeah I don't I don't think you'll be able to tell, but you can go for it like
[9813.00 → 9815.88] oh that's rough oh that's really rough they are
[9815.88 → 9823.64] ludicrously sharp that's rough um like I've had braces before yeah the metal ones are you've
[9823.64 → 9829.40] mentioned that they're proud off the tooth those are crazy, and so they sit prouder off the tooth and
[9829.40 → 9836.28] they are ridiculously sharp, and they're sharp they have sharp corners, and they're ceramic they're not
[9836.28 → 9841.96] smooth they have a kind of texture it feels like they should have been able to solve the sharpness you
[9841.96 → 9848.76] would think so that's nuts um I'm surprised this isn't like a more widely known issue because i
[9848.76 → 9855.64] can't imagine how that wouldn't irritate the inside so as far as I can tell the company that makes these
[9855.64 → 9864.60] um helps there be positive media about it, but you can find people complaining about how sharp they are
[9865.16 → 9871.16] but uh I didn't google it I just was like oh yeah I don't know 3d printed ceramic, and it's faster yeah
[9871.16 → 9878.52] let's do that one i I strongly regret the choice that I made the inside of my mouth is always shredded
[9878.52 → 9884.28] and these glue things they'll stay on I can't imagine how it wouldn't be anywhere from a week to
[9884.28 → 9890.36] like a month um and then i but like my Orth's been pretty good about it, I can go and I can just drop in
[9890.36 → 9896.52] I don't have to make an appointment I can go in any time and get them to reapply them um but literally
[9896.52 → 9903.16] if it meant that my teeth could not look yellow um I don't even care because I'm going to have that
[9903.16 → 9909.48] glue on my teeth yeah and I'm going to keep eating butter chicken so go yourself is there some
[9909.48 → 9916.28] can you discolour it with something else um because yellow is particularly would I look better purple
[9916.28 → 9922.28] like what are you even getting at here I think I should eat beets I think so because like in
[9922.28 → 9928.36] your peripheral view it's just like a glow of yellow which is yeah yeah I saw some comments so
[9928.36 → 9933.80] so there were some new folks watching the uh the steam frame and steam machine
[9933.80 → 9939.00] videos those were far and away out performers for our channel, so there's been some kind of new viewers
[9939.00 → 9944.60] coming in or people who haven't been around for a while and so there was uh more than you know with
[9944.60 → 9950.12] the core audience that watches all the time comments on the braces or and some that i apparently
[9950.12 → 9954.28] don't brush my teeth it's like no, no I brush my teeth in fact I have to work very hard to brush my
[9954.28 → 9960.36] teeth because of my stupid orthodontics that are all over them, but it's okay it'll only be another year
[9965.72 → 9971.80] you want your teeth to be yellow for a year dude no yeah I don't want it I wonder like someone's
[9971.80 → 9979.88] someone suggested kool-aid to colour them a different colour what why would I do that I'm not
[9979.88 → 9987.56] going to do that I'm not going to do that like green would that be better red what would you prefer you pick a
[9987.56 → 9993.96] pink teeth would look better no that would follow your style diseased yeah
[9993.96 → 10000.12] there's no proper colour for teeth except white or a little bit yellow those are the only natural
[10000.12 → 10007.08] colours for teeth I'm sorry that's not a little bit yellow dude the curry was worth if it was delicious
[10007.64 → 10014.20] it's like the yellow in the mountain on your starry night shirt it's like that yellow it's its not
[10014.84 → 10015.64] slightly yellow
[10015.64 → 10022.52] actually I have a bar of yellow hold on it's like it's like in here
[10025.32 → 10032.84] you start g76 okay outstanding uh they use different recipes at some of the locations so i
[10032.84 → 10038.12] can't really speak to any of the ones other than he just takes a photo standing in front of it and
[10038.12 → 10045.16] it's mostly of him other than surrey central store yep that's incredible this guy that's so good i
[10045.16 → 10050.60] asked the staff if he's like this in person, and they were like yep he's just wearing a Gucci jacket
[10050.60 → 10057.24] in one of them he is apparently he's not in these he is apparently exactly like this that sucks he's
[10057.24 → 10062.12] exactly like you would imagine and this is the kind of like decor they have I don't know if they have
[10062.12 → 10066.28] any pictures of the insides of the restaurants but like they always have Mr bean playing in this one on
[10066.28 → 10071.72] the uh on the TV like the animated Mr bean it's I don't know it's super weird, but it's good it's
[10071.72 → 10078.60] good curry there's one showing up in Langley city nice I'm excited about that solid you stat g76
[10079.16 → 10085.88] quality my favourite Indian food place is gone oh really yeah which one masala Indian bistro oh bummer
[10085.88 → 10092.12] yeah yeah my old favourite was actually taken over by USTA g and I got lucky because it's even better
[10092.12 → 10097.80] uh it used to be called taste of Punjab that one and then uh USTA g came in and put some artificial
[10097.80 → 10103.64] turf up on the walls okay so literally every single time the flow plane team visits we go to
[10103.64 → 10108.92] masala yeah AJ's pointing out our tradition we go to masala every time because it's like a few of their
[10108.92 → 10112.60] favourite restaurants but like especially Jonathan but like a few of people's favourite restaurants
[10112.60 → 10115.96] um and I don't think any of them knew it was permanently closed yet but yeah yeah
[10115.96 → 10123.24] you start g76 maybe yeah we'll have to we'll have to do something because masala I call it
[10123.24 → 10131.00] masala, but there's a bunch of he is a g it does kind of fit it does really fit like how dyed is that facial
[10131.00 → 10133.64] hair yeah
[10136.92 → 10142.84] but yeah it's gone if you if you google it, it's gone, and it was really highly rated and i honestly
[10142.84 → 10151.64] don't know why it's gone I hope it's for some good reason yeah probably not they had a
[10151.64 → 10158.92] lot of people there it was perfect very good speaking of good reasons Jack Dorsey felt he had a
[10158.92 → 10168.12] good reason to fund divine a vine reboot that includes vine's video archive and bands AI content however
[10168.12 → 10174.52] they're going to enforce that Jack Dorsey is backing the vine a reboot of vine through his non-profit
[10174.52 → 10179.48] and other stuff which is interesting because twitter owned the old vine before shutting it down in
[10179.48 → 10188.12] january 2017. The app was created by current and other stuff um and former Twitter employee Evan
[10188.12 → 10195.48] Henshaw Plath aka rabble using data previously stored by archive team which is also not the same as the
[10195.48 → 10202.92] archive.org team rabble was able to restore 150 to 200 000 original vines from 60 000 creators who can
[10202.92 → 10209.24] contact him if they want to take control of their reconstructed accounts divine breaks from its short
[10209.24 → 10214.76] form video brethren by banning AI generated content it'll use tech from the human rights non-profit the
[10214.76 → 10221.72] guardian project to confirm that a clip was truly captured on a smartphone huh I mean okay I wish them
[10222.44 → 10228.28] does that work perfect anyone no idea plus because it's built on not a decentralized protocol
[10228.28 → 10232.04] favoured by Dorsey and is open source okay I'm actually starting to think it might be cool
[10232.04 → 10236.28] developers can set up and create their own apps and run their own hosts relays and media servers you know
[10236.28 → 10243.24] what you know how did that suddenly get really cool right at the end that started pretty and uh now I'm
[10243.24 → 10249.32] open to it that was really fast yeah I think that's about the fastest I've had my mind changed on
[10249.32 → 10258.28] something in recent times yeah okay all right Dorsey I'll bite not everything you've done has been
[10258.28 → 10266.36] super-duper amazing across the board if we want another weird update that's like sort of related to
[10266.36 → 10273.48] this uh this page got an update dig got an update we talked about this a while ago that they
[10273.48 → 10278.20] were launching dig again, but now there's like a tagline for its humanity at the core technology
[10278.20 → 10281.96] at the edges we're building a human first community platform that places authentic
[10281.96 → 10286.84] community and connection at the forefront from day one I got an invitation I've been too busy to actually
[10286.84 → 10290.20] sign up for it but I got an invitation for this so maybe I'll be able to check it out, and we can talk
[10290.20 → 10299.72] about it later um, but it's interesting man that Reddit has so much inertia oh yeah
[10299.72 → 10306.28] yeah wouldn't even describe it as momentum it's more like inertia it just has this like mass
[10308.60 → 10316.68] that is just it's its impossible to replicate for a new platform yeah um our discussion question
[10316.68 → 10321.96] for the vine thing divine is um how is short form video evolved since fine's departure I mean honestly
[10321.96 → 10328.44] is if it's pretty similar yeah I think it's pretty similar it's got less uh meme-y and funny and
[10328.44 → 10335.72] it's a little bit more definitely more addictive yeah like the the the masters of it have had a lot
[10335.72 → 10343.48] more time to master it dude it's still fascinating that lime vine sorry ever shut down fascinating
[10343.48 → 10348.92] yeah gotta be one of the craziest fumbles every periscope sure yeah what did its value add
[10349.56 → 10357.88] um I mean vine was wild I mean I didn't care about vine um but so many people did some of the
[10357.88 → 10363.16] those popular videos on YouTube when vine was around was vine compilation like it's still it's
[10363.16 → 10369.64] like part of my personality yeah like yeah I don't know like i I have to confess I didn't really
[10369.64 → 10375.72] get it I didn't really care didn't care about short form video um, but it's its clear that a lot of
[10375.72 → 10383.64] people did I mean I guess the idea was just to migrate those users to twitter, but then it was never quite
[10383.64 → 10389.72] the same it's just it really captured like when we're talking Silicon Valley and capturing eyeballs
[10389.72 → 10396.20] it like really captured eyeballs I don't know I don't know if uh capping people at six seconds is
[10396.20 → 10402.12] still going to be interesting I don't know if that's going to work that was sort of some of its downfall
[10402.12 → 10407.96] it did improve some of the quality because you actually had to construct a narrative in six seconds
[10407.96 → 10412.28] yeah you a lot of people I've heard recently complain about ticktock because you'll, it'll be
[10412.28 → 10416.36] like a one-minute video and they just kind of never get to the point yeah you have to construct
[10416.36 → 10421.40] something in six seconds but yeah how do you monetize it cat OS points out they did get rid of that in
[10421.40 → 10427.80] the in the at near the end and then what's the point it's just ticktock but yeah but ticktock wasn't
[10427.80 → 10434.76] around too slow which is my point which is like vine was freaking huge I mean if you look at the
[10434.76 → 10441.64] people that just because vine died moved over to YouTube and then became massive YouTubers absolutely
[10441.64 → 10447.24] they had just smash hit as much as I might not like all of them they had smash hit creators on vine
[10448.04 → 10455.16] it was like a cultural phenomenon, and they just shut it down wild I mean no one ever said twitter was
[10455.16 → 10456.20] a well-run company
[10456.20 → 10466.44] at any point at any point I mean that's been your stance has been pretty, pretty clear on Twitter being
[10466.44 → 10472.92] a dumpster fire then and now so is this really the only useful thing about Twitter is that practically
[10472.92 → 10480.12] everyone has an account, and you can dm people I'm thinking about just deleting mine though I think i just
[10480.12 → 10486.52] might be done I still use the dm portion often enough that I don't want to get rid of if it is
[10486.52 → 10490.28] still the easiest way for me to reach out to someone that I don't know and get a response
[10491.16 → 10496.60] unless that changes I don't see myself deleting my account I used to use more than twitter yeah but
[10496.60 → 10502.84] how do you find the person if I don't know the person yet yeah well I guess I still okay so I have
[10502.84 → 10507.64] the luxury of still having the corporate twitter if I really need to so I could make a connection with
[10507.64 → 10511.88] that which is your know it's verified whatever that means these days, and its yeah got a big
[10511.88 → 10516.84] follower account so it should, you know yeah and to be clear I like really don't use it that often
[10516.84 → 10521.80] but if I'm like hmm this one person that I know of would be like really useful to talk to you about
[10521.80 → 10529.96] this one topic but I've never actually had a contact with them um yeah that's totally valid jump on
[10529.96 → 10535.72] Twitter find them it's the same reason I have Facebook except that's for getting in touch with family
[10535.72 → 10542.84] in your life yeah that exactly I see no value to Facebook anymore except marketplace well yeah
[10542.84 → 10549.48] marketplace is very and died now but for only you all the rest of us get boring marketplace and you
[10549.48 → 10554.60] get all the fun one no I ruined mine no I actually bought some stuff, and now it's ruined there was
[10554.60 → 10560.68] someone on Reddit talking about how they were Linus training their I saw that dude hilarious crazy
[10560.68 → 10564.60] that it worked immediate results so sick
[10567.56 → 10571.32] training my marketplace to shoot an email next time then you might meet Torvalds
[10572.12 → 10579.88] here it is uh one week update on my marketplace training Taco Bell nine feet tall good potential
[10579.88 → 10590.12] uranium glass slag question mark spirit s1 LSA shiny plane BMW five tons six by six
[10590.12 → 10595.88] BMW excuse me full tank of gas for a ti 84 CE plus calculator
[10598.12 → 10606.20] vertical machining centres sure full-size traffic light retired plastic jersey barriers
[10607.32 → 10612.68] there's so much crazy stuff on Facebook marketplace so cool you just have to be brave enough to click it
[10612.68 → 10622.68] I love my favourite one was the potential uranium glass question mark yeah I loved that who knows what it is not me so good pay me
[10623.40 → 10625.56] pay me like what even is this
[10627.80 → 10636.68] uh AI artist tops country music chart kind of I hate this time AI generated music has routinely been charting
[10636.68 → 10644.12] over the past month or so but the track walks my walk by breaking rust has landed at the top of billboard's country
[10644.12 → 10652.44] digital song sales chart with over three million streams on Spotify which is a ton but not why it's up there
[10653.16 → 10659.72] it should be noted however that the digital song sales chart is not a mainstream chart and only required
[10659.72 → 10666.28] 3 000 sales in order to be topped sales are either 150 streams or a purchase from iTunes this means you
[10666.28 → 10671.24] can easily top the chart with an iTunes gift card and some bots and this is what I was going to add to
[10671.24 → 10679.24] this topic that I don't see in the comments but a lot of the comments on it are clearly bought
[10679.24 → 10682.36] batted definitely clearly and if you're going to buy comments
[10682.36 → 10690.68] why not bought streams yeah um as an example disturbs cover of the sound of silence which is an
[10690.68 → 10695.88] awful cover says Adam sondergaard I'm not taking a position on this has been at the top of the
[10695.88 → 10702.04] alternative digital song sales chart for 400 weeks that's a few that's wild that is a few casual eight
[10702.04 → 10708.12] years another AI artist mania Monet has been making headlines after signing a three million dollar record
[10708.12 → 10714.12] deal and her gospel track let's go let's go garnering millions of views across platforms that's not it
[10717.72 → 10725.80] that's not the title of the song what is it oh let go let god sorry i yep yeah that makes more sense
[10725.80 → 10731.40] that doesn't actually make a lot more sense or wait I guess it kind of does let go let
[10731.40 → 10738.28] it's i so it's Jesus take the wheel which is far as my understanding is not the lessons you're
[10738.28 → 10746.36] supposed to take but I mean it's been a while so I could be wrong you could be i I wouldn't presume to i
[10748.12 → 10755.56] I can't, I can't see its fascinating having an AI artist do religious songs there's god there's
[10755.56 → 10763.88] something in there somewhere something in there somewhere yep um discussion questions would
[10763.88 → 10772.92] you go to the concert of a virtual artist I mean no, no okay cool next question how is this different
[10772.92 → 10777.40] from bands like gorillas what about Hatsune Miku which performs songs written by a community
[10777.40 → 10785.40] well it's different because humans crafted that whereas this didn't have next question can there be true
[10785.40 → 10792.44] artistic intent behind AI music artistic intent okay well hold on a second I could see a poet
[10792.44 → 10799.64] making an argument that if they human crafted lyrics and then an AI like generated song something them
[10799.64 → 10806.12] there was at least some there was less than there was more than zero dirt dragon raises a very
[10806.12 → 10811.48] interesting point all right hit me we should make we shouldn't, we probably won't even need to make it
[10811.48 → 10816.44] happen it'll just happen but if it doesn't just happen we should make the Riley I'm taking a
[10816.44 → 10824.04] Christmas album top the charts what by batting it yeah you want to improve AI adoption yeah might as
[10824.04 → 10832.92] well use it for evil I mean good yeah sometimes they might be the same yeah uh he just left should we do
[10832.92 → 10842.92] something uh there are some topics in here that are not fully planned out so I won't do those what do we do
[10844.52 → 10849.96] it's not normal to have him just leave randomly does he I mean does he not want to talk about this
[10849.96 → 10859.48] interesting I can talk about this other topic uh Sony announced a cheaper Japanese language only PS5
[10859.48 → 10865.56] exclusive to Japan, and they also revealed a PlayStation monitor the PlayStation monitor is
[10866.36 → 10871.00] wild we'll talk about that in a second Sony announced a cheaper Japanese all that kind of stuff
[10871.00 → 10877.24] it's the first time they've region locked a console since the PS2 back in the year 2000
[10877.24 → 10883.32] uh like Nintendo's Japan only switch 2 model this special PS5 is Sony's attempt at making the
[10883.32 → 10889.56] console more affordable domestically Sony also announced a PlayStation branded gaming monitor
[10889.56 → 10896.60] the 2560 by 1440 monitor has an IPS panel and a 240 hertz refresh rate, but the 240 hertz refresh
[10896.60 → 10905.64] is only available when hooked up to a pc which is what very interesting what does that mean it just runs
[10905.64 → 10914.20] at 120 hertz when connected to PlayStation consoles huh, and it has a dual sense charging hook they are
[10914.20 → 10920.44] publishing their games on steam and pc now this is maybe not that weird the whole industry is getting
[10920.44 → 10926.52] very strange what is happening it's all topsy-turvy the weirdest out of all of it we're going to hit Xbox on
[10926.52 → 10935.16] the game cube it's like it's its a weird I don't know what's happening Sony hasn't priced the monitor
[10935.16 → 10941.80] they don't quote response times or brightness and even Sony's quoted HDR capability is vague at best
[10941.80 → 10949.72] with pc gamers saying that the monitor doesn't seem like a hugely compelling proposition for pc gaming
[10952.92 → 10958.60] interesting when we don't even know the price that's interesting discussion question do you have
[10958.60 → 10963.40] any memorable experiences with region locked products IDs tell us your tales if you don't have
[10963.40 → 10970.92] any anecdotes what are your opinions on region locking in general I don't like region locking
[10970.92 → 10977.32] I am conflicted on it's cheaper domestically thing I think it's kind of based even though I'm
[10977.32 → 10985.08] not going to benefit from it and then how do you do that while actually making it so that it's cheaper
[10985.08 → 10991.32] for everyone because they just order the ones in Japan um so I don't know but in general I think
[10991.32 → 11000.28] region locking is kind of bad because it promotes e-waste problems um what do you think yeah I think
[11000.28 → 11006.20] so I mean these days it's just kind of strange to region lock anything just because extremely
[11006.20 → 11013.40] unnecessary the whole world is super global now yeah pal FTSE is no longer a thing no, no I mean
[11013.40 → 11024.36] my thought would be taxes export that sort of stuff um you know I know Japan is a little strange in
[11024.36 → 11030.92] some regards I mean there's talk of flying to Japan to get like things cheaper than you could just
[11030.92 → 11036.36] importing them um which is very odd I wonder if that has to sorry I thought you're done
[11036.36 → 11040.52] talking for something go for it pinky draws I can't see you so I was about to say it's really
[11040.52 → 11045.88] hard yeah pinky draw says is it actually region locked or is it only sold in one region and i
[11045.88 → 11051.40] don't technically know, but it says in here region locked which would make me think it's not just only
[11051.40 → 11059.56] sold there another discussion question what comes to mind is your favourite unexpected
[11059.56 → 11066.12] console branded product or peripherals the know PlayStation 3d TV game cube or dream cast keyboard
[11066.12 → 11071.24] etc and I don't think I have one
[11074.84 → 11080.76] that's very boring but I think it's true very few come to mind because it specifically says
[11080.76 → 11085.00] unexpected so i I would traditionally say just like Xbox controllers because I like them so much
[11085.00 → 11092.44] more than PlayStation once what about that KFC thing was that real uh that's also or is that no
[11092.44 → 11097.56] that's that's the opposite yeah yeah darn I'm trying to think of anything float plane
[11097.56 → 11102.92] chat do you have anything I don't think I have an example I don't have an example at all oops oh well
[11102.92 → 11107.24] uh but yeah that's that's kind of funky and weird what is your thought on them making it cheaper
[11107.88 → 11113.48] in Japan what do you think about that well that's kind of that makes me think that is definitely some
[11113.48 → 11119.40] sort of like you know export thing yeah I feel like if there was a Canadian company, and they made
[11119.40 → 11125.64] it is cheaper for Canadians I would think that was cool I'm fine with that yeah I think if they're
[11125.64 → 11134.76] basically sacrificing their like margins um locally and putting it up elsewhere that's that's
[11134.76 → 11140.28] fine sacrifice is that when you pretend to kill someone to appease the gods yeah it sounds like
[11140.28 → 11144.44] it or do you actually kill someone to appease a fake god oh a sacrifice
[11147.24 → 11151.08] I think it could be either maybe it's one of those words with two definitions did I interrupt uh
[11151.08 → 11157.16] only slightly uh PlayStation 5 exclusive version in Japan its region locked, but it's cheaper
[11157.80 → 11163.32] also they released a monitor region locks are anti-consumer and should always be objected to
[11163.32 → 11167.88] yeah yeah it's cheaper just like naming it the same thing when it's actually a different product
[11167.88 → 11173.32] we should always object to that it's cheaper for them so I think this is their way of making it
[11173.32 → 11180.36] cheaper for Japanese people why is it cheaper for them this is fairly normal and if it's only sold in
[11180.36 → 11186.68] Japan, and it's cheaper no I mean what do you mean it's cheaper for them like for Sony this region
[11186.68 → 11194.92] no for Japanese people in Japan okay, but you can only use it in japan or with Japanese games
[11194.92 → 11200.60] or other stuff the regional thing correctly which I think we are no it's still anti-consumer yeah they
[11200.60 → 11205.80] should just sell it for like cheaper in Japan if they really want to, but then that's going to get
[11205.80 → 11212.52] abused immediately obviously but then like if they can afford to sell it for that much then they should
[11212.52 → 11217.40] just do that obviously not how that works you know that I mean even shipping something out of Japan
[11217.40 → 11222.84] like it would have to be markedly cheaper for it to not make more sense to just that's fair buy it
[11222.84 → 11229.24] somewhere else when it's been shipped in bulk I don't know how much the discount is 5 500 55 000 yen
[11229.24 → 11230.28] yeah let's convert that
[11233.88 → 11242.36] USD wow that's really cheap 355 compared to the normal one was is this a pro or is it normal I think
[11242.36 → 11248.68] it's normal digital edition so it's the non-disc normal one yeah it's still 350 bucks okay yeah
[11248.68 → 11254.28] people would buy 500 people would buy them in bulk yeah and ship them overseas um
[11258.60 → 11263.96] all right I'm thinking how else could you do this I don't think you can
[11266.12 → 11270.76] I don't like that there's region locking I agree I think it's anti-consumer as well I don't like it I think
[11270.76 → 11277.16] it's a bad contributor to things like e-waste and just not good things in general yeah but i also
[11277.16 → 11281.64] think it's kind of cool that they're offering a domestic discount I'd be okay with it if they
[11281.64 → 11287.72] committed to unlock it like when it's x amount of years down the line yeah that's cool I like that
[11287.72 → 11290.68] I think that would be a good compromise a lot um
[11293.32 → 11295.96] if the ps6 launches you unlock all of them
[11295.96 → 11306.44] thinking or like a year into the ps6 being around okay how would you feel about a device that rather
[11306.44 → 11313.32] than being region locked was cheaper up front, but the games were more expensive
[11315.08 → 11321.48] what about a global unlock code so you have it in japan I'm just I'm just chit-chatting now
[11322.20 → 11327.96] oh, so this has nothing yeah what if they had a 300 PlayStation 5, but every game costs like 20 more
[11329.16 → 11333.48] knowing that most people will buy like between five and a dozen games or whatever so they make
[11333.48 → 11337.56] their money in the longer term, but it's basically it's choose your own adventure on whether you want
[11337.56 → 11341.88] one that's priced profitably in the first place with cheaper games or whether you want one that's
[11341.88 → 11344.68] priced cheaper but you know you're going to pay more for the games
[11344.68 → 11352.36] if you still had the option to buy the full price one would you object to them having like a cheaper
[11352.92 → 11357.88] subsidized game I don't think so if you still had the option there's definitely people that will buy
[11357.88 → 11364.68] a console for two games yeah even one game in certain cases so that was fascinating to me when
[11364.68 → 11369.96] I first found out that there was like people who would play star craft and not video games they would
[11369.96 → 11377.16] just play star craft there was no other video games that they ever played I was like oh wow and
[11377.16 → 11380.68] then I started realizing that that was true for a bunch of different games i just first discovered
[11380.68 → 11389.72] it was star craft my life for hire see I thought they were mercenaries my life for hire for the
[11389.72 → 11390.68] the longest time yeah
[11390.68 → 11400.52] that's fairly reasonable i I never like thought about that but yeah it does kind of sound
[11400.52 → 11406.44] like hire I didn't know what zealot meant so i just yeah I just thought zealot I'm pretty sure
[11406.44 → 11413.40] is the right way to say it I'm fairly certain I said zealot oh i 100 did yeah so many years 100 so many
[11413.40 → 11422.04] years um anyway I don't think there's much more unpacking of that I really like the idea of the
[11422.04 → 11428.52] region lock just being timed though I think that's really cool I like that a lot it's pretty funny that
[11428.52 → 11434.68] the monitor only runs at its maximum capabilities hooked up to a pc uh all right cool well did you
[11434.68 → 11441.00] guys already talk through this yeah okay all right cool we can close that then uh what else we got uh
[11442.76 → 11449.40] there's lots yeah there is's so much uh we can do here a couple rapid fire topics a group of us
[11449.40 → 11457.48] lawyers has documented 509 cases of AI misuse in court filings no notes that's terrible that's rough the UK
[11457.48 → 11464.92] is probing whether Chinese-made Yutong electric buses on British roads can be remotely disabled um
[11467.88 → 11474.52] yeah so this is bad because Norway discovered that its Chinese-made buses can be remotely turned off
[11474.52 → 11483.00] by the manufacturer um this needs to not be a thing and not specifically because these buses are made in China
[11483.56 → 11491.08] but again because like calling a product the same thing or region locking it's just bad when you buy
[11491.08 → 11496.76] something you bought from anywhere, and you should have easy access to find information about it and
[11496.76 → 11504.84] you should have the right to use it in whatever the country you want that's it I object your honour
[11504.84 → 11516.12] what else we got hackers speaking of right to repair and right to use things you bought hackers are
[11516.12 → 11522.12] reviving google's discontinued nest thermostats with an open source project called no longer evil yes
[11522.68 → 11529.40] amazing name hard to believe incredible name google recently abandoned their nest thermostats making them
[11529.40 → 11534.44] no longer smart because google moved them to end of life and ripped functionality out of them they were
[11534.44 → 11545.24] launched between 2011 and 2014. Cody Kohima has personal incentive to revive these thermostats due to prior clashes with Google
[11545.24 → 11552.36] but also a possible fifteen thousand dollar financial incentive from full to bring bricked devices back to life
[11553.72 → 11559.80] this is cool the thermostat believes that it is communicating with the official nest infrastructure but instead
[11559.80 → 11565.48] connects to the no longer evil platform this approach ensures full compatibility with the device's existing
[11565.48 → 11571.80] software while breaking free from Google's cloud dependency the firmware images and back-end API server
[11571.80 → 11577.56] code will be open sourced soon allowing the community to audit improve and self-host their own infrastructure
[11577.56 → 11582.84] how cool is this the firmware upgrade from GitHub is still in the development stage so the usual
[11582.84 → 11589.72] precautions apply, but it can be easily integrated into home assistant using MQTT or rest APIs after
[11589.72 → 11595.32] applying the firmware the user will be met with a new greeting now made with 100 less evil freaking
[11596.44 → 11600.76] love it and our discussion question is should right to repair regulations be updated to include rules that
[11600.76 → 11607.72] provide immortality for evil devices the answer is yes it needs to be done yesterday this needs to be
[11607.72 → 11615.48] dealt with instead of whatever the crap it is that legislators are doing right now um oh there's more
[11615.48 → 11622.76] bad news though memory prices are set to skyrocket due to demand from AI data centres this was prepared by
[11622.76 → 11632.84] Mr panorama SanDisk has reportedly raised its NAND flash price contracts by 50 for November numerous module
[11632.84 → 11639.56] makers have paused shipments to re-evaluate their quotes transcend has suspended quoting and deliveries
[11639.56 → 11646.84] starting November 7th anticipating this is a quote favourable market conditions this comes as the memory
[11646.84 → 11653.00] market is being dominated by demand from AI data centres and constrained wafer supply, so this is a really
[11653.00 → 11658.12] important point for folks that are looking at this going well why is ddr4 ram affected that's older
[11658.12 → 11665.96] why is gamer memory affected it's because you still make ram out of the same wafer whether it's
[11665.96 → 11672.68] going into a server or a phone or a laptop or a gaming computer or whatever the case may be okay that's
[11672.68 → 11678.44] not quite true like ddr4 ram might actually not necessarily be made on the latest nodes but still
[11678.44 → 11687.32] in general you are constrained by how much fab time there is um so in response to constrained wafer supply oh
[11687.32 → 11691.88] it's the wafer supply specifically okay not okay so it would be constrained by supply of the actual
[11691.88 → 11697.08] wafer so that would affect any manufacturing process so in response manufacturers have shifted their
[11697.08 → 11703.24] production focus away from products like consumer SSDs and ddr4 to more profitable ddr5 and HBM this is
[11703.24 → 11710.28] causing a rise in pricing across all memory related products uh here's an interesting memory price trend
[11710.28 → 11717.24] page from pc part picker whoops doodles here's the last 18 months stable stable stable
[11717.24 → 11724.52] stable oh no edr4 3600 stable down down up stable stable stable
[11727.56 → 11728.92] yeah, so this blows
[11735.80 → 11736.12] neat
[11739.88 → 11744.28] while customers are left scrambling to adapt transcend into disk and apace rare reporting revenue
[11744.28 → 11750.92] increases exceeding 60 year over year for q3 so bully for them, I suppose um discussion question
[11750.92 → 11755.80] is if you're looking to purchase flash storage or ram would you aim to buy now or try to wait it out
[11755.80 → 11763.56] you could be waiting it out a very long time um AI data centre demand won't collapse until the bubble
[11763.56 → 11770.04] pops and what is it they say the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain
[11770.04 → 11777.48] solvent yeah yeah fun times in other news uh AI powered Russian humanoid robot
[11777.48 → 11784.44] walks on stage and falls on its face sounds about right i um all the uh all the non-Russian ones are
[11784.44 → 11788.36] held up by chains and cables so I don't know who's doing better I don't think that's true
[11789.00 → 11793.72] unitree looks pretty Memling impressive at this point uh here's a video over on
[11793.72 → 11799.88] yeah unitree's dope here's a video from blue sky oh
[11802.04 → 11815.32] wow this is very far behind oh boy and oh wow and there it goes oh, oh
[11816.76 → 11821.56] it's funny you could tell they knew it was screwed yeah you could tell that it's uh it's Russian because
[11821.56 → 11831.32] it had some vodka before it went out on stage wow wow wow um the creators accompanying the robot
[11831.32 → 11835.80] and some crew immediately try to pull the robot off-stage and hide broken leftover pieces with a
[11835.80 → 11843.16] large black cloth after ALGOL that's the name of the robot um threw itself off a building sorry I mean
[11843.16 → 11852.76] fell over on the stage oh here's another fun one this is another kind of rapid fire one we sponsored a
[11852.76 → 11853.72] smaller creator
[11855.80 → 11864.92] rude you might have heard of them oh my god ads love it hey, but this is uh also a much smaller sponsorship
[11864.92 → 11870.92] watching their ad hold on i have to find it
[11875.48 → 11879.40] I actually don't know where the uh spot there it is hey you might know this guy
[11880.76 → 11886.12] I think I've seen him before I've seen some very interesting speculation that we are like on terrible
[11886.12 → 11893.40] terms or something with people who leave the team, or you know whatever it is our earnest goal
[11893.40 → 11901.48] to be on good terms with anyone who departs here and uh it is our genuine
[11902.60 → 11909.40] wish that they continue to be successful outside leg um I mean look at it this way
[11910.68 → 11918.52] let's let's assume that I was entirely driven by my own narcissistic ego assume let's assume that
[11918.52 → 11929.80] we don't know that but let's assume it would, I want someone to have a five-year career or 10-year career
[11929.80 → 11938.68] here and not come out with useful skills such that they could be a success right it would just
[11938.68 → 11945.40] speak more well to you if they did how would that reflect on your company me and this organization
[11946.68 → 11951.32] I mean I'm always talking about it world-class team you know
[11953.64 → 11963.00] let's assume the worst possible set of assumptions about me even then would I have an interest in people
[11963.00 → 11968.36] flying free and then falling flat on their faces if it's worse possible assumptions than
[11969.00 → 11975.48] sure but I'm extrapolating this a little bit too far I mean okay I mean the worst possible
[11975.48 → 11981.80] reasonable assumptions about my character oh you added reasonable though we're okay what
[11981.80 → 11985.88] assumptions could you make about my character such that I would want Alex and Andy to fail if it's
[11985.88 → 11992.28] the worst possible assumptions that I could make anything you just like hate people and everyone
[11992.28 → 11998.12] and you want it's like that quote of like my success means nothing if others do not also fail
[11999.00 → 12006.12] have you heard that before uh but my success can also be measured by the success of people that i
[12006.12 → 12012.68] agree I agree you said worse possible I guess that would be that would be terrible there's people like that
[12012.68 → 12024.68] um okay I mean that's really stupid um anyway yeah so the point is I'm I'm very I'm very excited this is
[12024.68 → 12036.20] actually not the only um move yeah that you guys will uh that you guys will see we've got some
[12036.20 → 12040.92] pretty cool I don't I don't want to t I don't want to spoil anything because I don't want to take any of the
[12040.92 → 12046.04] the wind out of the sails of the people who are going to be you know doing their own because
[12046.04 → 12050.04] that's that's the thing right is they're on their own they're doing their own thing which I'm I'm very
[12050.04 → 12056.68] pro entrepreneurship I've always been pro small creators I've always been pro consumer I've always
[12056.68 → 12062.20] been pro entrepreneurship so I want to see people spread their wings and fly and I want to let them
[12062.20 → 12067.64] kind of talk about the partnership in their own authentic voice before I go and put any words in their
[12067.64 → 12079.24] mouth, but this will not be the last um this will not be the last sort of collaboration slash partnership
[12079.24 → 12085.40] with people who used to be on payroll and no longer are it might not be hard to I think it's cool
[12085.40 → 12092.84] stretch that far uh considering you did personally go out of your way to make us that I couldn't meet Linus Torvalds
[12092.84 → 12102.28] so you know that even if only 0.1 percent of people are stupid enough to believe you're right now
[12103.88 → 12113.72] that is still 10 people so you now way to go, but there's also the Vaud you me 10 times plus the Vaud
[12113.72 → 12116.76] that's not enough i have to pump those numbers up
[12121.40 → 12126.12] oh man yeah it's cool i I think that's awesome um
[12129.96 → 12131.88] very cool people have any questions
[12135.16 → 12140.92] mew asks is leg becoming a creator university you get paid to be at I don't I don't I don't know i
[12140.92 → 12144.44] mean we've talked about the worst thing we've talked about this a fair bit lately right like
[12144.44 → 12152.28] what is my legacy yeah because if that happens, but we get you know if company hat firmly on if we get
[12152.28 → 12158.68] good value out of them while they're here yeah and then if they fly free yeah why shouldn't we be
[12158.68 → 12165.96] happy about leave companies we have existed for so long at this point yeah 13 years and like if we
[12165.96 → 12172.92] want to keep existing for say that amount of time longer people are going to continue to leave that's
[12172.92 → 12179.72] what it is a fact of having companies basically there are some people as well that like they just have
[12179.72 → 12184.12] it in their veins that they're going to be running their own thing they're going to be an entrepreneur
[12184.12 → 12188.44] at some point just born to be an entrepreneur that's fine that's good we want them here sure
[12188.44 → 12193.80] if they want to be here for a while have some drive grow they tend to be motivated people
[12193.80 → 12198.12] you're probably going to be here for at least a few years they tend to be innovators we will have
[12198.12 → 12205.48] definitely gained thing as a gained things as a company from you in that time uh, and then you can
[12205.48 → 12211.32] fly free if you want and look I'm not necessarily stay forever I'm not necessarily you know looking
[12211.32 → 12217.16] for suggestions for people for us to work with we make a good faith effort to part on good terms
[12217.16 → 12224.68] with everybody that doesn't necessarily mean that we succeed every time um you know and a door is
[12224.68 → 12234.52] never completely shut almost never completely shut um, but we're definitely going to make the call
[12234.52 → 12240.44] in terms of you know who we are interested in partnering with right because you look at the way that
[12240.44 → 12246.04] we choose our sponsors it's going to be the same kind of thing we're going to be just like we partner with
[12246.04 → 12251.64] sponsors who we believe have strong character, and we hold them accountable in the same way the people
[12251.64 → 12256.20] that we're going to partner with in terms of sponsorships we're going to be we're going to be
[12256.20 → 12261.56] selective and that applies across the board you know whether someone's a former employee or whether
[12261.56 → 12267.56] someone isn't um you can expect to see in general a lot more creator sponsorships coming from us in the
[12267.56 → 12274.52] in the coming months and I'm actually super stoked about if it's um it's pretty cool to kind of go full circle
[12274.52 → 12282.36] from being the sponsor e to the sponsor it's weird it's its super weird it's very weird it's
[12282.36 → 12290.36] weird looking at a video from the other end if that makes sense yeah uh and like and like I don't have
[12290.36 → 12297.40] to do the negotiations on this stuff myself right but like obviously you know for me to kind of just
[12297.96 → 12303.24] throw the money out there and hope that the end product you know and my team is you know making sure
[12303.24 → 12308.84] that everything goes smoothly and their link is correct like little stupid things that we know
[12308.84 → 12312.92] we have to deal with on our side and just kind of seeing it from the brand side it's
[12313.72 → 12317.88] it's really weird yeah I was trying to scroll through his video to find the sponsorship on my
[12317.88 → 12323.40] own laptop and i and I found it and I want to watch this with sound because his intro into it looks
[12323.40 → 12330.52] funny but um this is extremely unrelated but he talks about asset to Cora um
[12332.44 → 12338.36] so of course yeah they have a new game that's in early access right now
[12339.72 → 12347.80] called asset to Cora rally that I'm like really hyped for having you played it at all I haven't I have to get
[12347.80 → 12354.76] my sim rig set up you have to tell me how this is yeah because I used to love the dirt games i
[12354.76 → 12360.60] when's the last dirt that came out well I mean I'm a dirt ones tan second one was kind of not as good
[12360.60 → 12368.68] in my eyes but having it in an asset to Cora engine is going to be amazing I am very, very excited
[12369.96 → 12374.12] there's I read the reviews there were some comments on it like you know they don't have the physics
[12374.12 → 12378.52] dialled yet and stuff like that so I'm interested in hearing what you have to say and this is what
[12379.08 → 12384.12] I use VR for all the time that's why i kind of like that high-end tethered experience like dude
[12384.12 → 12387.96] this is what I meant when I was like I don't know that I'm really going to regret buying the big
[12387.96 → 12392.20] screen beyond probably because if I can wear the big screen beyond to play this that's what I want it
[12392.20 → 12400.44] for you know the the the heavy index does get kind of like irritating when you're rapidly shouldered
[12400.44 → 12407.00] checking um right yeah right because I do some eye racing on the side too and like you're you're
[12407.00 → 12411.56] basically like sitting there whipping your head about for three four hours straight sometimes and it
[12411.56 → 12422.12] gets exhausting yeah sorry I know that was quite the gear shift um but I'm very I'm very hyped for
[12422.12 → 12427.64] that game I was going to steam to look for the official page for the new hardware they're launching
[12427.64 → 12434.12] and that came up first for me and I was like oh nice anyway yeah it's exciting I like the idea
[12434.12 → 12439.40] i have to check that out yes, yes I haven't had a functional computer in a well desktop in a very
[12439.40 → 12446.44] long time so who knows but um it's its cool I like the idea of working with creators that have
[12446.44 → 12451.72] worked here in the past I like the idea of fostering those relationships I like this concept that like if
[12451.72 → 12457.08] we last for a long time we might end up building our own kind of like ecosystem of creators around here
[12457.08 → 12463.16] I don't know if our own is fair enough to say but like we could end up contributing towards uh an
[12463.16 → 12469.64] ecosystem of creators around here because you know like there's many but there aren't like a ton in our
[12469.64 → 12479.80] space at least creators in the tech technology c area um so just like effectively kind of contributing towards
[12479.80 → 12486.68] that being more of a thing would be pretty cool Canada tech creator valley sure sweet it sounds
[12486.68 → 12494.92] awesome to me yeah I don't need a new computer uh it's my apartment is effectively non-functional
[12494.92 → 12502.12] meaning my computer is like put away right now all right I think it's time for land show after dark
[12502.12 → 12506.20] are we done all the topics did we do it we're done we did it all right
[12509.80 → 12524.68] heck yeah let's go what oh I just thought you might read a merch massage I was making it
[12524.68 → 12528.92] getting horrible he's doing work oh I thought I curated this one
[12530.12 → 12536.76] uh the one thing I couldn't get out of Linus t was I couldn't get him to say I'd like to interject for a
[12536.76 → 12546.92] moment he didn't like he didn't think it was funny I was like okay well actually I wasn't like okay i
[12546.92 → 12552.60] tried really hard I think I overheard some of that yeah I was getting more and more upset for you
[12553.72 → 12561.00] no yes it was Stallman but that's exactly what's funny about if it's Stallman was it the point is i
[12561.00 → 12565.24] well I tried to get him to do I was going to refer to him, I was going to refer to myself as
[12565.96 → 12569.56] Linus and I wanted him to say I'd like to interject for a moment what you're referring to as Linus is
[12569.56 → 12576.04] in fact Linux Linus uh or as I've taken to calling it but like he was just like I don't think it's
[12576.04 → 12581.24] funny I'm like okay I see what you're going to understand him not thinking that's funny yeah
[12582.20 → 12587.88] I thought it was very funny though yeah so i tried i I almost died on that hill sure fortunately he
[12587.88 → 12594.28] didn't just pack his bags and leave yeah this is not worth actually dying on but i I can definitely
[12594.28 → 12599.40] appreciate an effort Sammy me by like not getting the reference I was like no, no people will get the
[12599.40 → 12604.28] reference it'll be hilarious and I was like sammy you're dialled in would have gotten it
[12604.28 → 12610.28] to like internet, but he like didn't know I'd like to interject for a moment Sammy's dialled into brain rot
[12610.28 → 12620.60] oh it's not the terrible thing yeah yeah yeah it completely me on that one okay buying the computer
[12620.60 → 12627.48] the commuter bag for my wife a soon-to-be doctor of physical therapy this would be a good professional
[12627.48 → 12633.56] backpack nice do either of you have any funny or interesting stories about physical therapists
[12633.56 → 12638.28] physical therapy humour Dan what are you even trying to do right now I don't know curate this
[12638.28 → 12645.56] you have elbowed i when I was having crazy knee problems sure okay funny I tried to solve it through
[12645.56 → 12651.32] physical therapy I ended up solving it with YouTube videos which is strange but okay I went to multiple
[12651.32 → 12659.48] physiotherapists at first one of them wanted to do uh needles, but it was like little ones yeah needles
[12659.48 → 12663.64] people always correct me on because there's like big ones and little ones and people I say
[12663.64 → 12668.04] acupuncture or whatever the other one is, and they correct me whatever it was little needles they're
[12668.04 → 12674.12] putting them in my quad, and she ended up like sending me away as a client like oh I will not do this with
[12674.12 → 12678.28] you anymore I can maybe do other things with you, but we will not do this because she'd put them in my
[12678.28 → 12684.60] quad and then my quad would go and bend them all right so you were breaking all her needles yeah nice
[12684.60 → 12691.24] okay that's pretty funny all right that's the best I got didn't they also tell you that you were
[12691.24 → 12696.68] weird as all he'll like very strange client because you actually did the exercises as we were assigned
[12696.68 → 12703.00] yeah yeah my current physiotherapist said that basically I had an I don't know what it was
[12703.00 → 12707.24] I had problems with my thumbs I screwed up both of my thumbs which was kind of weird, and he gave me a
[12707.24 → 12711.96] bunch of like little hand push-ups and like all these other weird things and then I came back to him
[12711.96 → 12717.80] and was like we're good let's work on something else but like the thumbs are good, and he was like
[12719.16 → 12725.72] what which was great that's cool all right well I have nothing for funny physical therapy stories
[12725.72 → 12733.72] but I do have some validation um of that merch message that the commuter bag is awesome I got this
[12733.72 → 12740.92] from the head robot at brand a few minutes ago um got the CW holiday care package genuinely so good
[12740.92 → 12748.52] thanks team loved it I'm going to out him here I'm going to do it kept the commuter bag for myself
[12749.56 → 12751.88] tossing my peak design oh
[12755.48 → 12757.08] usually companies don't name other companies
[12759.16 → 12767.56] leaked the dm Sammy did it to me today seems fair yep seems fair you know what that is
[12767.56 → 12774.44] actually like a killer endorsement because you know what the head robot is like in terms
[12774.44 → 12780.28] of attention to detail and quality and appearance I'm sure, and you've seen how expensive the head
[12780.28 → 12787.88] robots stickers are so surely the head robot could afford any backpack that he or she desired yeah yeah
[12787.88 → 12789.40] yeah, yeah so with all of that in mind
[12793.56 → 12799.00] okay what's next pretty good cue for Luke if you had a nickel for every time you missed out on a gigantic
[12799.00 → 12806.84] Linux related event you'd have two nickels which one hurts more this one what was the first one
[12806.84 → 12813.88] I don't even know what could even compare to this that's this is the one to end all ones I'm sure i
[12813.88 → 12821.80] could search my brain vault and find it uh I vaguely have a memory of that being a thing, but there's too
[12821.80 → 12829.56] much recency damage um that I can't, I can't even I think the term is recency bias no just damage
[12829.56 → 12837.80] sorry dude Vance is nothing if he's not efficient
[12840.52 → 12845.96] up next hi overly charismatic man Dan and chicken in sauce pan
[12848.36 → 12854.04] these are getting very creative you've heard of price to performance now you're hearing of
[12854.04 → 12862.52] size to annoyance what is the small what is the smallest thing
[12865.40 → 12868.12] Linus excluded that bothers you most
[12872.44 → 12878.68] all right I like it that's a good question that's a quality merch message because it's Linus excluded um
[12878.68 → 12884.12] I'm going to go no i I mean if I was the smallest thing that annoyed you the most it would be good for me to know
[12887.16 → 12895.72] I'm going to go with eating sounds that is actually my barometer for if I'm in a bad mood because sometimes
[12895.72 → 12905.00] I can't tell but if someone is chewing a little bit next to me, and they don't have their mouth open or
[12905.00 → 12911.16] anything but I can just hear eating noises I get a bit of monophonic I don't love eating noises at the
[12911.16 → 12918.20] best of times um like my stepdad oh used to drive me nuts because he would eat cereal with
[12918.20 → 12924.84] his mouth open and to be clear my stepdad is the best stepdad that ever walked the face of the earth
[12924.84 → 12930.68] he's pretty great I was never treated any differently from his own blood children and that is something that
[12930.68 → 12941.72] is maybe not completely unique, but it is pretty darn special for a stepparent to have to for me to
[12941.72 → 12948.92] go through I don't know how many like I don't know how many years I lived with them or even before I lived
[12948.92 → 12957.40] with them like the second he married my mom I was his kid I was his son and I called him dad
[12957.40 → 12962.68] dad call my dad too but whatever dad two dads turns out it doesn't up that much
[12965.32 → 12966.84] it's obviously different context
[12975.08 → 12975.80] the point is
[12975.80 → 12982.84] we have a literal button on the show
[12986.60 → 12992.84] the point is he wasn't much of a quiet eater um and so it's I've always known that it's something
[12992.84 → 12999.80] that kind of like bothered me but I've I've outgrown it I've like mostly gotten over it except when I'm
[12999.80 → 13006.60] low blood sugar or I haven't had enough sleep or usually both I'll be like I'll realize I'm like
[13007.48 → 13014.04] holding something kind of tight and Yvonne's just like sitting there like eating something I'll be
[13014.04 → 13021.88] like okay I need to deal with this because I am about to like to slap the food out of her hand
[13022.92 → 13028.92] if is I don't deal with my mood right now so that I'd say that's mine I've had the eating noises
[13028.92 → 13037.16] thing as well but I think a more recent so like current one and i it feels almost irrational well
[13037.16 → 13042.28] that's the thing but I mean that's basically what we're being asked right it drives me insane when
[13042.28 → 13050.44] someone is there are forms of it that are okay, but it's like when it's quiet enough that you're
[13050.44 → 13057.00] doing this or yeah this um but if you're playing stuff on your phone on speakers in public
[13057.00 → 13062.36] oh I mean that's just that's not even a small thing, but this has been confusing to me that's a big
[13062.36 → 13068.04] thing it's been confusing me because like I was waiting at a train station recently and someone was
[13068.04 → 13073.40] playing music out of a Bluetooth speaker attached to their backpack just walking around yeah and it
[13073.40 → 13080.36] drove me nuts no that person's just an f***ING ass, but then somebody drove by somebody drove by in a car
[13080.36 → 13087.72] that had fairly loud music that didn't bother me that's interesting because that I thought was
[13087.72 → 13093.40] weird they both bother me equally they don't bother me equally okay let's go in between what about
[13093.40 → 13097.88] someone with their Bluetooth speaker hanging off of their cycle their bike their bicycle that's the
[13097.88 → 13101.72] word I was looking for I feel like that would bother me because I feel like i I was trying to unpack
[13101.72 → 13106.28] this and I don't know for the cycle it'd be interesting to like to have it happen and then try to evaluate but
[13106.28 → 13112.84] yeah okay the car one to me is it's like it's theoretically their space, and it's leaking out
[13112.84 → 13117.88] of their space yeah, but they very clearly don't need it to be that loud in their space they're
[13117.88 → 13123.16] literally damaging their hearing, and they're making it your problem that's true I also wonder like if
[13123.16 → 13129.16] their window was open would that change for me or not I'm not sure I don't know okay what if they were
[13129.16 → 13135.08] in their own house but their music was so loud that you could hear it inside your own house this is an
[13135.08 → 13143.72] interesting one as a condo dweller this is the thing that happens and I generally try to respect it
[13145.32 → 13150.76] because I'm like you know what we're all stuck in this big thing together what if it was detached homes
[13152.04 → 13159.00] and you could still you could hear their music clearly I feel like if it was an event or a movie nope
[13159.00 → 13166.28] it's just always like every day that's pretty annoying yeah we actually then it might change
[13166.28 → 13174.60] if this is a garage band nope okay we had to go confront this hole back when we were uh when Brian
[13174.60 → 13181.00] the electrician and I were filming the uh installing ac in my attic thing because it was so loud we couldn't
[13181.00 → 13189.00] film from uh from a house away um and i actually i probably still have audio of the interaction
[13189.00 → 13196.20] somewhere but basically like this guy was the biggest piece of garbage ever like as we walked up to the
[13196.20 → 13203.08] door the like two-year-old two to three-year-old was about to come bolting out and I like there's a
[13203.08 → 13209.72] road and I like stopped him and the first thing he says to me is not touch my son and I'm like bro i
[13209.72 → 13217.32] wouldn't need to if you weren't an utter delinquent um what a way to start a conversation
[13218.84 → 13224.04] I'm not saying what you said is that i just the whole scenario and dude this house was so
[13224.04 → 13229.08] loud like when the door was opened we're talking hearing damage for that kid like
[13229.96 → 13234.84] crazy and he's like I have to have it like this I'm a DJ I'm like you what so you're the world's first
[13234.84 → 13239.48] DJ that hasn't heard of a pair of headphones you have to be kidding me right they literally have
[13239.48 → 13245.32] headphones designed I mean this guy's a piece of work these actually like to do it you can turn the
[13245.32 → 13253.88] cup wild wow wild i I don't I don't think I've had much of a dumber conversation with any like
[13253.88 → 13262.60] otherwise seemingly coherent functional human being also like man you are not recreating the speaker
[13262.60 → 13269.24] set up at the club with your home thing if you can get if is you I actually don't know this because
[13269.24 → 13275.64] I'm I don't partake but if you can get high from secondhand marijuana smoke that kid was probably high
[13275.64 → 13286.44] like it was intense you can oh okay well there you go man brutal neighbour I think it has a
[13286.44 → 13291.40] name I think it's called contact high I'm sure someone in full point chat will correct
[13292.60 → 13300.76] no okay yes something like that yeah I feel terrible for the kid too
[13303.24 → 13308.20] like I can't feel bad for an adult that is just like an idiot and harms themselves I just don't really
[13308.20 → 13313.32] care that's that they're an adult and they have agency contact high is psycho
[13314.52 → 13320.44] psycho somatic oh apparently it's fake huh you just think you're high never mind then I don't know
[13320.44 → 13326.92] then rick says we used to call it hot boxing yes it's a contact high well apparently there is some
[13326.92 → 13330.76] there is some disagreement about that
[13330.76 → 13335.32] I'm going to consult the sans
[13337.72 → 13340.68] the sans say yes what's the sans
[13341.24 → 13348.36] AI AI you have to be kidding me okay let's move on this guy I was doing it as a joke uh i know
[13349.48 → 13354.44] ah they said washroom I was looking for this one I tried bathroom restroom all that sort of stuff
[13354.44 → 13359.72] question for Luke while Linus is in the washroom probably gen AI is being compared to the industrial
[13359.72 → 13366.44] revolution short-term disruption with long-term benefits how much carnage until the good part so
[13366.44 → 13367.16] tell me something
[13369.72 → 13371.08] the industrial revolution
[13373.96 → 13382.20] benefit yes but to everyone no or was the benefit
[13382.20 → 13384.44] benefit massively
[13385.48 → 13393.72] unequal and is it in fact worse for people who are on the lower rungs of the social ladder
[13394.44 → 13395.72] than things were before
[13398.12 → 13403.72] I'm talking like you're sifting through you know the shipped off
[13404.92 → 13410.44] you know cadmium infested remains of technology in
[13412.20 → 13418.04] some place where they're literally just like burning this stuff to get to the precious metals that are in it
[13418.60 → 13418.84] like
[13420.36 → 13420.68] um
[13421.72 → 13428.28] the industrial revolution was highly beneficial to the owner class in the developed world I'm not
[13428.28 → 13433.56] convinced that it was necessarily beneficial to every human being on earth it's interesting because like
[13434.28 → 13439.48] you could argue a lot of medicines and stuff wouldn't have been possible really without
[13439.48 → 13445.16] more advanced technologies that came from things like the industrial revolution 100 and those
[13445.16 → 13448.44] benefited people but they sure as heck didn't benefit anyone who's not
[13448.44 → 13451.16] disproportionately benefit getting access to what you described
[13452.28 → 13455.88] yeah yeah yeah interesting uh to more directly address
[13456.52 → 13459.08] oh no I wasn't done okay keep going gen AI
[13460.20 → 13463.32] same thing I think that's what we're going to see I think we're going to see
[13463.32 → 13470.52] short-term disruption to in equally to people and I think we're going to see long-term benefits
[13471.24 → 13473.32] very in equally to
[13476.20 → 13482.52] I'd even wager more and equally possibly I also think it has an interesting effect um
[13483.56 → 13490.44] wendell shared me a meme recently that I couldn't agree with more um not directly you
[13490.44 → 13498.28] know whatever it's still a meme but um if it would load what discord hello uh anyway it was
[13498.28 → 13507.08] something along the lines of like if is the world realized how fast um like local AI is getting
[13507.08 → 13513.48] perfect here it is yeah it's its a tweet apparently uh if people understood how good local
[13513.48 → 13519.16] LMS are getting the stock market would crash tomorrow um, and it was a response to a tweet that said
[13519.16 → 13523.40] anthropic doesn't want you to know, but you can self-host LLM like Queen and use it in clod code
[13523.40 → 13532.44] for free um there is an interesting side effect of this where the beneficial part for some people
[13532.44 → 13538.20] is happening now it's less applicable to some, and it's highly applicable to other others locally hosting
[13538.20 → 13546.28] this stuff is expensive and not the easiest thing for everyone to do um, but you can also gain access
[13546.28 → 13551.32] non-locally hosted that was just kind of an aside for actually quite cheap and in a lot of cases
[13551.32 → 13555.88] completely free, and it's enabling this like i I don't remember who was talking about it but
[13556.44 → 13565.80] it's there are some comparisons you can make to renaissance knowledge education speed of learning
[13565.80 → 13572.76] and ability to jump into something from nowhere and get to a fairly uh competent point has like never
[13572.76 → 13579.32] really been easier flip side speed of misinformation and disinformation for sure like there are I'm not
[13579.32 → 13583.72] I'm not trying to hide that there are extreme negatives right I'm saying that in some cases there
[13583.72 → 13591.72] are there are the ability for one person to leverage themselves very highly I don't think has ever quite
[13591.72 → 13597.08] been at this level before no which is I agree which is very, very interesting and some people are
[13597.08 → 13604.12] already turning that into like highly positive beneficial situations overall what we're doing is
[13606.44 → 13612.36] enabling the surveillance of extreme garbage and slop massive amounts of surveillance state because
[13612.36 → 13617.48] self-hosting is so expensive that you're probably doing it through some other system which is harvesting
[13617.48 → 13622.12] every single thing you've ever typed into it building profiles on you like we've never seen before
[13622.12 → 13632.04] like only wet dreams of early Google um like there 's is so much bad but in almost everything
[13632.04 → 13637.48] especially this complicated there are diamonds in the rough and there are people that are utilizing
[13637.48 → 13646.04] this stuff to extremely beneficial personal and I mean small person degrees social mobility is I guess
[13646.04 → 13651.56] what you're trying to massive amounts of it for specific people who can think of a way to leverage it
[13651.56 → 13657.32] yeah for themselves positively, but that doesn't change what I said about the benefit being highly
[13657.32 → 13661.72] unequal and all knowing socks says even homeless people have super computers in their pockets the
[13661.72 → 13666.84] industrial revolution came with new problems but was overall beneficial but I think you're missing part
[13666.84 → 13675.40] of what I was saying and yeah a homeless person in the USA is probably in a better position than that same
[13675.40 → 13687.40] homeless person in Southeast Asia or India oh well yeah um and like the USA is actually a very small portion of
[13687.40 → 13695.48] the global population like I don't know that um I don't know that he literally did divide it up by like
[13695.48 → 13703.24] countries yeah people in western countries I don't think necessarily always remember how uh in the minority we are
[13703.24 → 13716.04] in general um yeah it's going to be a rough uh and frankly all of this I mean we have to keep in mind
[13716.84 → 13722.60] all of this is coming from the perspective of someone who is much less likely to be harmed by any of this
[13722.60 → 13735.80] um oh yeah uh yeah like we're we're going to be fine we're in a position to leverage AI leverage this revolution
[13736.60 → 13740.52] um invest capital and benefit from it like it's uh
[13742.68 → 13748.20] um like when I say this is bad I don't mean bad for me, i just I mean bad like generally
[13748.20 → 13750.60] it's yikes
[13752.76 → 13757.88] mule Jin which I hope I said correctly said dude the p did I just lose audio did you just unplug
[13757.88 → 13763.64] I'm sorry I'm just fidgeting uh said dude the people in Chile that sort ores and chemical baths
[13763.64 → 13769.24] for like 20 cents a day it's absolutely crazy yeah they are not better off than they would have been
[13769.24 → 13774.20] in like a more agricultural society 200 years ago i I pretty much promise you that
[13774.20 → 13780.68] yeah it's weird, but yeah there are it man I'm sorry
[13783.00 → 13788.12] is it working there we go and like the uncontacted people in South America that are getting like
[13788.12 → 13795.80] mercury poison from illegal gold mines they're not better off that makes sense yeah but i i I mean it's
[13795.80 → 13801.72] I think it's important to see both ends of it at the same time and hold both sides of it in your in
[13801.72 → 13808.28] your mind I think you need to like to have a more accurate perspective on it, I guess I think you need
[13808.28 → 13814.36] to recognize the good sides and recognize the bad sides um there are absolutely ways that it has helped
[13814.36 → 13821.24] I think the modern renaissance version of it is something that shouldn't be ignored even while you
[13821.24 → 13827.96] can hold and understand the concepts of the negatives that it is also creating um and I mean bots makes
[13827.96 → 13832.28] a good point you know scholarly papers I've seen on global food security show it's way better globally
[13832.28 → 13838.12] than before the industrial revolution as is medicine and that's fine but that doesn't change that
[13839.08 → 13848.92] a generally good thing can still be worse for some people and that was the entire point was that this is not
[13849.72 → 13857.24] a universal benefit yeah like the industrial revolution this is not going to universally elevate people there
[13857.24 → 13861.80] are people's lives who will be worse for it um there are also people's lives who will be better for it
[13861.80 → 13871.00] and some who where it will be much better, but it does seem like this one steers even farther
[13871.64 → 13878.20] toward benefiting the haves at the expense of the have-nots and the surveillance one is a huge one that we
[13878.20 → 13886.68] didn't touch on too much but is a major element of this i I don't know that in another 30 40 50 years with
[13887.24 → 13896.04] autonomous autonomous autonomous tools for population management and cameras everywhere I don't know that
[13896.04 → 13896.60] um
[13896.60 → 13903.48] I don't know that peasant uprisings will still be possible
[13906.52 → 13913.16] I don't know that you'll still be able to overthrow a corrupt dictator I don't know that it will be
[13913.16 → 13919.40] possible any more something makes me want to push forward the indomitable human spirit I feel like
[13919.40 → 13925.88] we'd find a way but I understand what you're saying I hope so I still have that hope there's a lot there's
[13925.88 → 13930.20] a lot of you know the gen z uprisings and stuff there's a lot of crazy stuff going on right now yeah
[13930.76 → 13938.84] big and in a lot of ways good but there's no there's no army of you know impervious you know robot
[13938.84 → 13945.56] dogs with AI true controlled turrets on them hacker bros dude hacker bros let's hope for the best
[13948.28 → 13951.56] hacker bros are goaded but like how are the North Koreans doing even now
[13953.48 → 13955.56] but that has nothing to do
[13958.68 → 13964.20] I mean they're definitely using population management tools yeah guarantee you they're using AI yeah
[13964.20 → 13972.36] it's 100 the wealthy pitting us lesser against each other yeah I mean for sure well it's the
[13972.36 → 13975.40] cookie thing there are few truer memes than the cookie meme
[13978.84 → 13986.60] big time how is that not the first cookie meme google are you trying to hide this from me
[13986.60 → 13995.16] i could see cookie monster stuff being shared oh wow yeah but still how far do I have
[13995.16 → 13997.24] to go for this surprise it hasn't shown up yet
[14001.40 → 14003.72] there we go top left
[14009.00 → 14013.96] I don't know what it says, but this is the meme yeah it's basically this yeah
[14016.60 → 14020.12] yeah yeah
[14024.52 → 14032.84] uh but anyway yeah it's you know if you can afford I'm once I get my stupid condo to liable again um
[14033.48 → 14040.12] I'm planning on trying to figure out local hosting in a big way for a wide variety of things um
[14040.12 → 14049.32] but including local km and AI services I don't really want to use public ones much moving forward
[14049.96 → 14057.88] um I want to shift to that uh largely inspired by Wendell I was already planning on it but largely
[14057.88 → 14066.28] inspired by Wendell um and I would highly encourage all of you to explore it um I understand it can be
[14066.28 → 14070.84] expensive there are also much cheaper ways to approach it used hardware is obviously a good
[14070.84 → 14078.76] way to go um the the the mac stuff is very, very interesting and if you can't jump in now there's
[14078.76 → 14086.04] always the possibility that these big data centres will be updating cards eventually um and what
[14086.04 → 14093.24] you can run now on that level of hardware will be runnable in the future on that level of hardware
[14093.24 → 14100.84] so you might be behind, but you'd have at least what we currently have today um at your usage
[14102.92 → 14109.40] um there was a pretty good little chat message here coordinated carry asks can you name one change
[14109.40 → 14114.68] with truly universal benefit I'm going to go with open source
[14120.36 → 14121.80] anyone harmed had it coming
[14125.64 → 14130.52] I just got kind of I've got Mr Torvalds on the mind i can counter that okay counter that hit me
[14130.52 → 14135.96] because there's been malware distributed through open source stuff there has been there's been ways
[14135.96 → 14143.00] that was open source that I don't think, but it enabled it is enabled it but net did it make the
[14143.00 → 14149.32] life of that person who was infected with malware worse oh that's that's pretty because overall it
[14149.32 → 14154.76] contributed so much positive to their life too I have to look through some of some of the cases
[14154.76 → 14161.80] of open source is a pretty good one um open source or source available
[14161.80 → 14169.32] that is a good question walker 161 penicillin yeah penicillin was pretty dope well where's not
[14169.32 → 14174.44] exclusive open source never said it was yeah not even a little bit didn't even sort of say that
[14175.00 → 14181.56] I do indeed like both hot dogs and hamburgers all right insulin uh yeah insulin was pretty
[14181.56 → 14184.44] that's a pretty good argument that was us wasn't it yeah Canadian innovation let's go
[14185.24 → 14187.48] you're welcome base base
[14187.48 → 14195.08] did he sell it for a dollar something like that based absolutely based and yet somehow it
[14195.08 → 14201.32] still costs a lot of money in some places ridiculous yeah in spite of our industrial
[14201.32 → 14208.92] medicine uh okay carry on Dan hey big l remember when the internet tried spotting your face in computer
[14208.92 → 14216.04] case reflections back when slick pc kept things secret was it all fun or did it ever feel like stalking or
[14216.04 → 14221.16] doxing its kind of hard to even remember it about I thought it was pretty fun I think I thought it was fun
[14221.16 → 14225.48] yeah I'm pretty sure we both thought it was pretty fun I think so it's genuinely been
[14226.12 → 14228.92] I was talking about this the other day it's been almost half my life
[14230.12 → 14234.68] because the whole thing was stupid and didn't matter like the only reason for the secrecy was
[14234.68 → 14243.96] because the original NCI cameraman didn't and still doesn't want his name out there and so it started
[14243.96 → 14249.00] with calling him the cameraman because he didn't want his name used and then I was like well this
[14249.00 → 14253.72] has become kind of a shtick for the channel so now it's just a thing so you need a nickname because it's
[14253.72 → 14259.72] Linus and nickname person who's off camera and then, but it didn't it never mattered it wasn't like Luke
[14259.72 → 14265.96] asking if it wasn't like the cameraman where Luke cared so it was just for the memes I also didn't
[14266.76 → 14273.16] care that I was being hidden either like I just didn't care it got kind of dumb eventually but
[14273.16 → 14279.48] eventually then we changed it yeah, and then it was fine it just didn't really matter that much in
[14279.48 → 14283.96] either direction until it got dumb hey thanks for your purchase
[14287.56 → 14293.72] hi do in retrospect do you have components of float plane labs or other development projects you wish
[14293.72 → 14299.80] you had gone with a commercial product rather than developing on your own thanks for the merch one
[14299.80 → 14304.60] of the one of the problems so i can point at a bunch of stuff on float plane and be like yeah but
[14304.60 → 14310.12] one of the problems was a lot of them didn't exist at the time, or they might have existed but their
[14310.12 → 14316.84] continued existence was very questionable to the point where we even picked something that we went with
[14316.84 → 14323.56] that uh still technically exist but like not really, and we're somewhat locked into it so
[14324.20 → 14329.56] the existence seemed solid, but it was very expensive or that like there was always a reason
[14329.56 → 14336.76] for doing things the way that we did yeah it didn't stay reasonable yeah always yeah uh and there's some
[14336.76 → 14341.96] stuff that we will still probably pivot off eventually there's some stuff that we already have
[14341.96 → 14347.88] um and that'll keep changing over time but like I think the initial decisions made along the
[14347.88 → 14353.00] path were very reasonable considering the knowledge we had at the time I understand that's
[14353.00 → 14358.20] not the question that you're asking um you're saying in retrospect uh but yeah at the time the
[14358.20 → 14363.88] decisions were made there was usually not an option that made more sense um if we could have snapped
[14363.88 → 14367.80] our fingers and known that certain systems were going to remain or that certain systems would have had
[14367.80 → 14374.36] uh very effective price decreases or whatever there are a couple changes uh it would be pretty sick to
[14375.08 → 14379.32] actually I mean it's been pretty good for a while now, but we went through a lot of trials and
[14379.32 → 14387.00] tribulations with transcoding um our current system is pretty dope transcoding all the backlogs for the
[14387.80 → 14396.68] the uh sauce plus stuff while also transcoding like Jeff Deerling's backlog upload all at kind of like the same
[14396.68 → 14404.12] time and no one noticed, and it was like really fast and very parallelized was sick it was very cool to
[14404.12 → 14411.48] like do that sort of on our own we talked about this uh I think last week, but we have auto generated um
[14411.48 → 14419.08] AI generated uh closed captions yep on uh automatic or automatic ones on float plane now we're doing the
[14419.08 → 14425.48] compute on that that is whispered oh sorry yes yeah, but we're not we are doing it's running like on our
[14425.48 → 14434.52] stuff yeah and like that's cool yes i like do it's yeah anyway so yeah i I don't know uh for the
[14434.52 → 14441.48] lab uh what exactly was the question was there something well you weren't involved in a lot of the
[14441.48 → 14446.44] early decisions so I wouldn't so I'm sure he'd do it differently, but that doesn't necessarily mean that
[14447.40 → 14453.32] um Luke sort of made a mistake or whatever or even that it was a mistake it's just everyone has a
[14453.32 → 14462.36] different philosophy yeah all right Dan hit me hi LLD I got to go to IBM's future of tape event and
[14462.36 → 14470.84] Jesus tape well wow and see their development eight track but no tape is we're doing nine
[14470.84 → 14478.76] tape is legit I know don't make fun of tape man and see their development uh lab for physical and virtual
[14478.76 → 14485.56] tape virtual tape hard drives yeah insanely cool it's virtual tape would enterprise tape be interesting
[14485.56 → 14493.24] enough for a Ltd video I have a guy we've done some videos on tape I don't know what more there would
[14493.24 → 14503.72] be to say other than yep here's the new generation tape and um it's denser so we did this a
[14503.72 → 14513.88] number oh my god that was seven years ago we got a 5500 tape drive and um you look so baby I know right
[14513.88 → 14520.68] and this is if it's thunderbolt go figure and I think we still have it somewhere um
[14522.36 → 14528.84] i I don't know that it's changed enough that I would have anything new to say about it in the last seven
[14528.84 → 14534.84] years it's its it's faster and denser but if I'm missing something here please let me know okay
[14534.84 → 14543.40] virtual tape is interesting actually IBM TS 7700 virtual tape library 4.2 petabytes for high performance
[14543.40 → 14551.80] workloads uh looks like that which is sick um the new IBM TS 7780 virtual tape library the latest in the
[14551.80 → 14557.56] generation operates at disk or SSD speeds while maintaining and this is the part what made it make
[14557.56 → 14566.60] sense compatibility with existing tape operations okay so it's just not tape, but it like acts like it
[14566.60 → 14578.28] so if you have systems that are expecting tape type operations it will work okay 46 petabytes of capacity
[14578.28 → 14586.60] delivered in an easy-to-use easy to service IBM diamondback tape library that thing no, no uh that's
[14586.60 → 14593.64] the tape one huh is that not what this is that's the actual tape as well as IBM storage deep archive
[14594.12 → 14602.84] ah okay yeah uh all right yeah neat cool I've never once used tape stuff I've always thought it's very
[14602.84 → 14606.84] fascinating it's very cool yeah and I've said everything I have to say about it, I think nice
[14607.64 → 14610.44] at some point I wonder if we should just wipe the channel and start over
[14610.44 → 14620.60] no why not but I think you should effectively do that in regard to video creation like just
[14620.60 → 14628.12] remake videos I don't think there's a reason to delete your evergreen but I do think it is sometimes
[14628.12 → 14634.68] ridiculous to be like we can't make a video on that we've made it before nine years ago as if like
[14634.68 → 14641.16] that really matters I don't I don't think that makes sense um my and i I do think we should
[14641.16 → 14646.12] recreate videos if they're beyond like a certain time threshold because it's all about the
[14646.12 → 14651.64] notification and stuff right like for a lot of people they're not going to search up a lot of
[14651.64 → 14657.56] these things they're looking for you to tell them and if you don't release a video on it now you have not
[14657.56 → 14667.56] told them I think it's totally reasonable I'll think about it hit me Dan l and l all the steam news
[14667.56 → 14675.08] resurfaced the old wan show episode with the legendary total biscuit as guest headline topic was OG steam
[14675.08 → 14681.16] controller that Brit is still missed what was it like having him on it was fun yeah i I didn't really
[14681.16 → 14688.36] know him before that, and we didn't really interact much after that and that's um no longer an option
[14688.36 → 14696.60] unfortunately um but yeah he was definitely uh definitely an I'd say one of our more outstanding
[14696.60 → 14703.40] guests what was it like having him oh it's sorry dyslexia on to out and I was like he didn't come up here
[14703.40 → 14713.08] my bad also we're um what looks like 25 videos away from 7 000 that's dumb that's a good time to
[14713.08 → 14717.40] quit I think it's big no that's too many it's becoming a funky thing where it's too many Dan's
[14717.40 → 14724.04] trying to figure out uh API calls and analytics, and we want to like call analytics from all of our videos
[14724.60 → 14730.60] that's a lot of API calls so we're like smashing into the quota cap, and we're talking to YouTube be like
[14730.60 → 14738.52] okay we have across our channels 13 216 videos oh yeah just pull analytics on that all the time
[14738.52 → 14747.00] too many times to quit i I pull every two hours so that's 160 000 API calls a day okay a little
[14747.96 → 14755.88] am I allowed to quit once I get to over 9 000 on the LTT channel ISO 9001 delete channel then is my
[14755.88 → 14758.36] is my power level high enough
[14760.92 → 14765.80] I feel you can take a sabbatical I could take a sabbatical and I've earned that at that point
[14765.80 → 14778.20] okay I'll keep that in mind hi LGS LL and dB how important is digital hygiene for you starting with
[14778.20 → 14785.48] deleting old items from download folders and continuing with removing unnecessary test policies as it admins
[14785.48 → 14793.24] if it's something I use frequently very important to me like my desktop is clean
[14794.36 → 14799.08] I think hold on let me check you probably just don't show it right desktop hide
[14799.08 → 14807.32] no you do show it oh no it's nasty it's not clean okay that's not nasty I've seen a lot worse yeah i
[14807.32 → 14812.36] have look at that I have like icons there, and they're not even like it is less than what I would
[14812.36 → 14817.56] have expected from you uh you know what I haven't been using this laptop for that long my desktop at
[14817.56 → 14823.56] home though like my desktop I would expect that to be very immaculate yes um and like
[14824.92 → 14828.20] I don't care about my downloads' folder because sometimes it can be convenient to grab something
[14828.20 → 14832.20] that I downloaded before I also don't care about my downloads' folder, but it's like one of the few
[14832.20 → 14839.16] spots my media folders very clean adhere to standard naming conventions I use file bot I think is
[14839.16 → 14846.12] what it's called to like make sure that it's all right and stuff um so yeah it just depends it depends
[14846.12 → 14852.52] how often I use it if I don't use it very often like oh my god like I still had my UB key active as
[14852.52 → 14858.52] a 2fa even though I hadn't used it in like nine years or something like that until Vance finally
[14858.52 → 14863.88] removed it like two weeks ago after I was like talking about how ridiculous it was on land show
[14863.88 → 14869.72] Rubik bio is really cool someone linked that to me bike bio yeah I'm gonna look at it
[14874.04 → 14876.84] I didn't know they did this I think it's pretty sick oh it's expensive
[14878.36 → 14887.72] it's cool though it sure is Geez it's like 130 bucks each yep well whatever sure fine
[14889.48 → 14895.56] yeah bio authenticated cool pretty sick makes sense not surprised they went that
[14895.56 → 14902.04] right yeah kind of makes more sense than the other one yeah here's the thing I have and I'm me boom
[14903.56 → 14913.56] yeah I like that all right what's up Linus last week you said no is lame yes and is cooler what's the
[14913.56 → 14918.36] best no you've given out I don't know um
[14920.76 → 14927.08] I would have said Christmas album but I finally caved last week no you caved to a new Christmas
[14927.08 → 14932.60] album you still said no to the old Christmas oh yeah that's true no, no it doesn't know I didn't
[14932.60 → 14939.56] no I didn't he said yes and only if Riley does a cooler one and only if that one is only a digital
[14939.56 → 14946.28] download yeah okay so yeah I tried to find a way eventually yeah because what have I said no about
[14946.92 → 14950.36] I mean what am I a no one
[14950.36 → 14961.64] oh yeah you yes added me on that one but I didn't like it I want to make a labs channel but I have been
[14961.64 → 14969.88] told no because I need a content schedule for it and I'm currently refusing to do that oh okay I think
[14969.88 → 14976.52] those are both reasonable things I actually didn't say no content schedule for the labs channel is
[14976.52 → 14983.32] reasonable I don't know if it makes sense I understand that makes it difficult to sell for
[14984.28 → 14987.96] I totally understand and if we don't sell for it, it will not make money
[14990.44 → 14994.36] my thing is right now we're just making articles which are awesome, but we just turn the articles into
[14994.36 → 15000.28] videos and no they're not every article is like LTT quality which is fine and never been the
[15000.28 → 15005.72] goal and to be clear we're not saying it's not quality I mean depth sure it's more or clickability
[15005.72 → 15009.40] or whatever however you want to call it just I thought quality was not the right word I think
[15009.40 → 15014.60] they're perfect quality no totally okay quality is incorrect word, but we're not going to get a
[15014.60 → 15022.28] million views on the 40 watt dynamic power adapter and iPhone 17 charging article I think it's sick
[15022.28 → 15026.84] though and I actually think a lot more people should know about it because it's a cool it's a cool
[15026.84 → 15031.64] it's very cool article the conclusion taught me things I liked it I don't think I'm actually the one
[15031.64 → 15043.08] who said no anyway or yes, and you might be right i think i uh I think i so if you're trying to
[15043.08 → 15048.84] do an end around right now I'm not I'm not I'm not getting involved no, no no I'm not okay
[15048.84 → 15055.72] Kingstown it's been a while since I asked I think I have asked Kingstown I'm not saying no I'm saying
[15055.72 → 15063.24] it's stupid okay so what's the end is I don't have the money for it yet I don't actually
[15063.24 → 15067.32] have unlimited money this may surprise you sounds like we're going to get there given the way that i
[15067.32 → 15072.84] behave loans are a thing you know buying fire trucks like how many kidneys do you have
[15072.84 → 15080.68] children we just got to get you to that beyond 9 000 videos, and we'll get there I mean i
[15080.68 → 15084.28] wouldn't even want to live in the town that's the real problem I don't think it's necessary
[15085.32 → 15090.28] that's stupid nope how can I run a cult if I'm not actually there you just need a really
[15090.28 → 15097.88] really tall tower outside the town how does Gabon run steam from a valve sorry from a yacht he
[15097.88 → 15103.08] gets it see yeah there's the yes, and we get him a yacht yeah but why are we not doing it you're not
[15103.08 → 15108.20] giving a proper, and you're not playing by your own rules well we just discovered that he would do it
[15108.20 → 15116.44] if there was a yacht so now we have the and let's move on okay cultists yes if you will be responsible
[15116.44 → 15123.16] for raising the money to purchase the town and I will do nothing but reap benefits from it then yes
[15123.16 → 15131.00] Linus town approved now he's thinking like a cult leader I like this good job okay up next before
[15131.00 → 15140.28] move to Taiwan ah that wasn't any that was I don't want to and therefore no that sounds like a pretty
[15140.28 → 15150.20] cool no though uproot your entire life no good idea but no i think I understand what you're
[15150.20 → 15155.16] trying to do with this whole don't say no say yes and thing, but it's also like extremely toxic at
[15155.16 → 15161.96] certain times I heard back from the head robot uh leaked the dm well-earned so we've got I've got
[15161.96 → 15170.20] approval that's so cool retroactive approval I know how are they so cool that's in general you want to be
[15170.20 → 15176.12] an enabler who enables the people around you that's all I'm trying to get across I know it's not a blanket
[15176.12 → 15180.60] rule I understand your point I understand your point thank you but just like when people say
[15180.60 → 15188.28] everyone you jump after them because you're like not actually everyone it's the same thing in general
[15188.28 → 15192.28] you want to be an enabler not like Megyn Kelly
[15194.84 → 15202.60] don't enable that all right well there's a fairly recent controversy I don't know who don't worry about it
[15202.60 → 15213.32] do worry about it actually do worry about this uh okay Dan hit me sure hey LLD Linus or slick if
[15213.32 → 15220.60] enough floaters that wanted a VR version of float plane would you do it what would a VR version of float plane
[15220.60 → 15228.52] be wouldn't it just be watching videos in a browser in your VR headset I think you have it already I mean
[15228.52 → 15231.88] I played float plane in the apple vision pro but I think what their meaning is like
[15232.60 → 15241.64] uh like 360 video noes you can turn your if it's a dead meme yeah it is for sure a dead meme yeah
[15241.64 → 15247.24] definitely not enough people want it, and we're hey we're doing we're doing what we can to give
[15247.24 → 15255.72] people what they do want right now okay we're focused on that all right um okay yeah yeah that's
[15255.72 → 15262.36] that's a no actually that's a no and here's the reasons are that you care and no one
[15262.36 → 15268.76] else and I'm sorry that it has to be like, but the question was if enough did you're not being very yes
[15268.76 → 15274.68] and right now Linus if enough did we do it of course there you go yeah they definitely don't though and
[15274.68 → 15279.40] I never will so there's that there's that caveat
[15284.84 → 15291.96] uh oh yeah I don't who do you think will be in the NHL play a Calgary Flames fan atp2 I don't know what any of that means
[15294.44 → 15299.80] me neither is that a gambling thing maybe play a no idea is that a thing do they mean playoffs
[15299.80 → 15310.04] no idea oh okay well uh up next play Alberta play a's it sounds like it's gambling maybe
[15310.84 → 15318.60] Disney Lucasfilm and muumuu Linus did you ever see the live action how to train your dragon
[15318.60 → 15324.92] will you visit the theme park in Florida I proposed to girlfriend in front of toothless
[15324.92 → 15330.60] there a few weeks ago she counter-proposed I'll go to the theme park I made it about
[15330.60 → 15336.36] 30 of the way through the live action how to train your dragon the original animated film is perfect
[15336.36 → 15342.52] and um the live action one is like a weird fun house mirror reflection of perfect
[15344.04 → 15348.12] they did stay very true to it and if it brings a new generation of people into
[15348.12 → 15355.96] you know thinking how to train your dragon and the sort of general message behind it of
[15355.96 → 15359.96] seeing past our differences even though we're enemies and all that kind of cool stuff I think
[15359.96 → 15367.24] it's a really cool story um you know if it does that then that's great I am a fan but I didn't
[15367.24 → 15370.84] personally have any use for it because the original was already a perfect film
[15370.84 → 15383.88] my award yeah what is this exactly I've received an award he's he doesn't he's talking but he
[15383.88 → 15389.96] doesn't he's not talking into a mic so is it another billy plaque um that's my guess I'm throwing
[15389.96 → 15393.48] a guess out there that's my guess you're throwing a guess a billy plaque no we already have a
[15393.48 → 15402.44] silver and a gold oh um I'm getting an award well I mean Luke doesn't need to be here for this then
[15407.56 → 15410.92] it's fine it's no, no no if you go in your camera they might be able to see it better
[15410.92 → 15415.00] just meeting okay they can see it after what is this
[15415.00 → 15427.72] actually what is it uh it's a Linus media group uh what is this what yeah what Linus media group
[15427.72 → 15438.12] brand impact award for hold on what is that for outstanding influence amplifying glints worldwide
[15438.12 → 15450.28] presence oh no I did know about this they invited us to an event and um to present it and i
[15450.28 → 15455.32] cool stuff I said regrettably we can't make it we did that we did that sponsored video with them
[15455.32 → 15461.64] recently I mean they make cool stuff upgrading Natalie's house cool I didn't know that I get
[15461.64 → 15466.84] an award for doing a sponsored video you know they already paid me right for the sponsored
[15466.84 → 15471.72] video I mean getting award is also cool I mean I don't I don't mind honestly I think you should
[15471.72 → 15476.52] give me an award every time you pay me you want me to give you an award every time no, no wait every
[15476.52 → 15484.04] time I pay you yeah I'd also have to give you an award no uh, uh no wait yes and if you hold on I'm
[15484.04 → 15484.44] thinking
[15491.24 → 15495.08] see I was going to say something like if you went sort of beyond the call of duty, but he really does
[15495.08 → 15502.44] yeah he's great um how can I justify not giving him an award every time I pay him
[15503.72 → 15511.24] huh um maybe I should, I'll tell you what here's what it'll be it'll be in the form of a monthly
[15511.96 → 15517.88] no a monthly budget on lttstore.com and occasional random lttstore.com things that's that's how we'll do
[15517.88 → 15524.44] it is nice yeah conveniently we already do that so is it a yearly budget yeah, but it could be broken up by 12.
[15525.08 → 15531.96] yeah being on wan show you also end up with a lot of extras I do I have no complaints you know uh
[15532.60 → 15538.44] there is a company that you and i both visited recently that I figured out what their merch budget
[15538.44 → 15546.76] is it good it's definitely lower than ours oh really oh, oh is this company does
[15546.76 → 15553.40] how do we not name them yeah i and like I don't think we would ever name this yeah I don't think
[15553.40 → 15559.08] we should name them yeah but yeah that you know we actually have a pretty generous merch budget i
[15559.08 → 15564.68] realized that like we actually do try to not be a place to work I told them ours while we were having
[15564.68 → 15569.24] that conversation, and they were like whoa and I didn't tell them the host one because the host one's
[15569.24 → 15574.36] higher it has to be because you're going to need stuff that you have when you're on camera like it yeah it
[15574.36 → 15581.64] has to be higher it makes sense I told them the like normal one yeah anyway we had this is a bit
[15581.64 → 15587.56] of a topic earlier hello LLD with the current ram prices rising due to AI demand do you think now is
[15587.56 → 15593.16] a good time to upgrade what are the long-term effects of AI infrastructure on consumer grade
[15593.16 → 15597.96] hardware prices long term will be okay if anything it'll drive it down because they're going to build
[15597.96 → 15604.04] up massive capacity and the bubble will at the very least deflate probably burst and the used market
[15604.04 → 15609.24] traditionally has actually benefited from large infrastructure expenditure as for now being a good
[15609.24 → 15613.96] time to upgrade probably I don't I think it's going to get worse before it gets better uh, but that's not
[15613.96 → 15623.64] financial advice hey Luke sharing the love of all things NASA have you ever seen a launch in person i also
[15623.64 → 15630.68] for a short time got to work with NASA Huntsville by a vendor customer relationship when did you get
[15630.68 → 15635.48] to see a launch in person one time I thought you missed it on like a thing recently I thought this
[15635.48 → 15639.80] was like another sore point there was a really cool one that I missed oh that's what I was this was a
[15639.80 → 15647.56] really random one uh but when AJ and I were down there for the threat locker conference oh, so this is
[15647.56 → 15656.76] recent then yeah we took off to go check out NASA and as we were pulling up uh there was one i
[15656.76 → 15661.08] was like checking my news the whole time because you know there would only be specific times that we
[15661.08 → 15665.80] could go yeah uh, and we thought we had missed it because we thought it had gone like the night before
[15665.80 → 15671.00] I think but there was some delay, and it made it happen that day, and then we couldn't go right away
[15671.00 → 15675.80] because we were doing stuff uh but by the time we could go we were like rolling up into the parking
[15675.80 → 15680.84] lot like when it was happening, and we ran to this like corner where we could see it so we hadn't
[15680.84 → 15687.64] even entered yet nice we were and we uh technically walked into the employee parking lot well just
[15687.64 → 15695.72] confidently and got to a got to a corner sorry got to a corner where we can see security yeah and we
[15695.72 → 15702.28] actually got like a pretty decent vantage point we ended up seeing like where a lot of people would
[15702.28 → 15706.84] watch it from the actual like kind of park thing that they have, and our spot was like actually
[15706.84 → 15715.64] pretty solid um I'm really hoping to see one of the Artemis launches eventually um a starship would
[15715.64 → 15721.56] be really cool sometime this was just more of like a fairly small somewhat routine thing that just
[15721.56 → 15726.20] happened to be going off the day the amount of rockets they're launching like all the time now is pretty
[15726.20 → 15735.96] wild so yeah um, but then we promptly exited the I believe employee only parking area and entered the
[15735.96 → 15744.20] park properly and then had a good time it was great hi LLD never knew I needed a hackable arch based VR
[15744.20 → 15749.08] headset until valve announced one any cool ideas considering you could almost certainly do anything
[15749.08 → 15755.16] with it also did it have a desktop mode I don't believe anything would prevent you from running desktop
[15755.16 → 15763.56] mode on it on a giant screen um for me, I think the biggest um the biggest use case this unlocks
[15763.56 → 15772.76] for me for VR is travel with my laptop I am like stoked to play full fat pc VR games with a laptop with like
[15772.76 → 15781.48] an e GPU and my VR headset that all packs into like my commuter bag that's crazy absolutely wild i really
[15781.48 → 15788.52] enjoy the idea of this thing being portable that's uh yeah I'm for sure getting one basically kind of
[15788.52 → 15793.56] depends on price I guess and we both but I'm intending on it, we both know the quest lineup exists but
[15793.56 → 15799.40] I don't think either of us has ever felt particularly compelled to go meta for our VR needs I have been
[15799.40 → 15808.44] fairly strongly turned off from that um yeah what was the product your own or third party that you knew
[15808.44 → 15816.12] about early that you found the hardest to keep secret oh, oh man there's oh man
[15823.72 → 15825.96] the hardest to keep secret
[15825.96 → 15832.84] I don't actually find out about third party stuff that early
[15834.84 → 15838.20] and I don't keep secrets very well for our own developments
[15839.88 → 15843.32] like I think that's part of the marketing strategy at this point
[15845.08 → 15849.00] probably the one that I struggled the most on was our battery bank
[15849.00 → 15856.76] um which we have alluded to but not really talked about much yet, but it's been in development for i
[15856.76 → 15863.32] think over two years now and for a long time I really didn't talk about it because the product
[15863.32 → 15869.40] itself was not particularly well-defined like we had um you know an idea of what we wanted to try to
[15869.40 → 15875.64] achieve, and we've achieved a lot of that but not all of it, and so we wanted to make sure that we weren't
[15875.64 → 15881.48] setting people's expectations too high it's getting pretty close to the point where I can start talking
[15881.48 → 15886.04] about it in more detail but yeah I'd say holding back a ton of that has been really challenging
[15887.88 → 15889.16] yes we're getting triple c
[15892.36 → 15899.64] you mentioned on last wan show that google killed the nest and a project was started I created it and
[15899.64 → 15905.08] open sourced it appreciate the shout-out also google was still sending logs from those devices
[15906.52 → 15912.20] shout out Cody k absolutely sick assuming you are actually the person who did it, and you're not
[15912.20 → 15918.20] just taking credit but yeah that probably you're honest but uh super cool and yeah that
[15918.20 → 15921.88] why does that not surprise me at all like i
[15924.36 → 15927.88] yeah shocked I say well actually not that shocked like it's
[15930.36 → 15933.88] you shut off my functionality, but yes still want my data really
[15936.20 → 15942.20] that's so cool if this person's the person who did that that's so sick enjoy your RGB sweater yeah
[15942.20 → 15950.52] hell yeah for both hosts for your main gaming rig are you team red or team blue for proc and wine
[15950.52 → 15952.12] well yeah obviously
[15955.24 → 15959.88] been red for a while yep better red than dead
[15959.88 → 15967.40] better dead than red I don't know it's rough over there right now man I hope they figure it out
[15967.40 → 15971.80] I hope so too uh a strong intel is good for the industry yeah
[15972.92 → 15974.12] last one I got for you tonight
[15974.12 → 15981.40] so LLD I love your zipper hoodie so I'd never pass up the red wan hoodie sick but I was a big fan of
[15981.40 → 15987.40] orange hope to see that again one day also what happened to the pajama pants they were great they
[15987.40 → 15992.68] didn't sell that well I love them too I love my Ltd pajama pants I only got one pair and I wish I had more
[15993.32 → 15998.28] um I don't know that we will do I don't know that we'll do an orange the red is selling really well
[15998.84 → 16006.28] and after many longs sometimes surprisingly intense conversations like we have passionate people here
[16006.28 → 16011.88] and they can be passionate about everything design colour you know fit materials right like
[16011.88 → 16017.48] the reason our products are good is that people care but when people care you can have strong
[16017.48 → 16021.48] opinions, and you can have clashes, and it's not like we have like a kind of culture where people
[16021.48 → 16027.08] would like yell at each other or be mean to each other or whatever but I've had some very
[16027.08 → 16035.48] opinionated conversations with particularly Bridget whose head of fashion and um you know she felt very
[16035.48 → 16044.76] strongly that having some red and some orange wan products was really confusing, and so we we we debated
[16044.76 → 16051.96] whether we should even be able to launch a red wan hoodie when we still have an orange wan backpack for
[16051.96 → 16060.52] instance and she made very good points about how that kind of confuses what wan branding means and I made
[16060.52 → 16065.96] very good points about how oh my god we can't hope to sell out all the desk pads and all the
[16065.96 → 16071.56] backpacks and all of the before we can like launch one product we want to get it out there
[16071.56 → 16076.84] and find out if people are going to even receive this red thing uh at all or if we're going to have to
[16076.84 → 16081.00] go back to orange anyway, and then we wiped out all inventory for nothing and then made a big bet
[16081.00 → 16089.48] on red everything for nothing um, so everyone had perfect points and what we settled on was okay
[16089.48 → 16097.96] I agree with you that it needs to not be confusing you're 100 right, but the business needs us to test
[16097.96 → 16106.92] this before we can commit full hog and I think at this point she's one that red works, and it's time to
[16106.92 → 16114.44] go full hog and once we do that then I think she's right that wan can't just be random colours it has to
[16114.44 → 16122.04] mean something and now I think it's going to mean red and gray and black well what chat has a very
[16122.04 → 16128.28] interesting point a lot of people in chat have a very interesting point does wan have an after dark
[16128.28 → 16135.08] sub brand no I think our monochrome brand is still stealth we haven't used it much purple lately oh
[16135.08 → 16143.48] interesting I could be open to that it's a genuinely fascinating idea the after dark hoodie i
[16143.48 → 16148.60] could get it I could yeah I could get behind that it's just interesting that we can throw purple into
[16148.60 → 16158.12] the brand mix very logically short circuit has it too short circuits um is predominantly purple isn't it
[16158.12 → 16163.08] it's a mix right yeah it's got it's got a variety of short circuit
[16165.08 → 16173.48] I like that Dan just said short circuit nothing else I mean they're purple yeah they are their
[16173.48 → 16177.08] main colour, so their main colour is purple they do they're like a bunch of stuff though
[16180.44 → 16187.08] orange pink purple white yeah dark blue all right yellow all right after dark hoodie
[16187.08 → 16197.32] I feel like an after dark hoodie might actually be really sick just saying
[16199.80 → 16201.16] after dark pants too
[16203.40 → 16204.28] assless chaps
[16207.80 → 16210.68] what pants do we have right now that could be after marked
