[0.00 → 3.24] What's up everyone and
[3.24 → 7.00] Welcome to the WAN show!
[7.20 → 9.76] We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[10.14 → 11.76] Android has become Apple.
[12.24 → 13.90] Sideloading? What? Who needs it?
[13.94 → 16.04] Who needs sideloading? Why would you want to install
[16.04 → 18.00] any app you want? You should just install all the
[18.00 → 20.00] curated apps from the app
[20.00 → 20.50] store.
[21.80 → 23.88] Good job Google, you're doing
[23.88 → 26.30] great. In other news,
[26.78 → 28.06] GPUs are...
[28.06 → 29.82] Oh actually, no, I'm going to go with a different one.
[30.44 → 32.34] Framework has done the impossible.
[32.72 → 33.94] Investment disclosure,
[34.42 → 36.20] they have somehow convinced
[36.20 → 38.22] NVIDIA to go along with their
[38.22 → 40.18] weird science fair project
[40.18 → 42.28] of a laptop and provide an
[42.28 → 44.22] upgradable GPU
[44.22 → 45.48] module for it.
[45.92 → 47.62] With Team Green graphics.
[47.88 → 49.40] Whoa. Right?
[49.80 → 52.18] Whoa. Whoa, indeed. That's weird.
[53.12 → 53.70] But cool.
[54.04 → 56.08] Also, the most important
[56.08 → 58.22] thing to me is a topic
[58.22 → 59.94] that I just titled in all capitals,
[59.94 → 61.56] is Battlefield going to be awesome?
[61.68 → 62.86] And then like 12 question marks.
[63.60 → 63.84] Because
[63.84 → 66.04] my two most
[66.04 → 68.04] major concerns from the beta
[68.04 → 69.70] are maybe being addressed.
[69.82 → 70.60] We'll talk about that.
[70.96 → 72.78] And I don't know for the last topic.
[72.94 → 74.18] Well those are your major concerns.
[74.28 → 75.80] But what about your sergeant concerns?
[76.16 → 77.82] And general concerns?
[78.28 → 79.66] I have those as well.
[79.84 → 80.82] Do you have general concerns?
[80.82 → 81.92] I have general concerns.
[81.96 → 82.20] Okay.
[82.42 → 82.74] Alright.
[83.54 → 84.82] Also, OpenAI
[84.82 → 86.62] is terrifying
[86.62 → 87.28] or something.
[89.64 → 90.20] Yeah.
[91.26 → 92.58] We talk about it every week.
[93.58 → 94.66] This one's bad.
[94.66 → 110.98] The show is brought to you today
[110.98 → 112.50] by Factor,
[113.30 → 113.84] Miró,
[114.30 → 115.18] and Green.
[115.56 → 116.24] And of course,
[116.32 → 117.40] we've got our wrap partner,
[117.60 → 117.90] brand,
[118.04 → 118.66] our laptop partner,
[118.72 → 118.86] Dell,
[118.90 → 119.62] and our chair partner,
[119.84 → 120.54] Secret Lab.
[120.54 → 122.96] They all merit a mention.
[122.96 → 124.98] Let's jump right into
[124.98 → 126.22] our headline topic,
[126.36 → 126.98] which is,
[127.10 → 128.08] of course,
[128.78 → 129.80] that Android
[129.80 → 131.62] has become
[131.62 → 133.06] what they set out
[133.06 → 133.90] to destroy.
[134.90 → 136.48] Earlier this week,
[136.90 → 137.96] Android announced that
[137.96 → 140.64] you shouldn't have to choose
[140.64 → 142.60] between open and secure.
[143.40 → 144.80] And they're now announcing
[144.80 → 146.24] that app developers
[146.24 → 146.88] will need
[146.88 → 148.66] developer verification
[148.66 → 150.92] even if the app
[150.92 → 151.82] is being
[151.82 → 152.94] side-loaded.
[153.64 → 154.36] Huh?
[154.48 → 155.60] How would that even work?
[156.20 → 157.32] There's a rollout period
[157.32 → 157.92] for this
[157.92 → 159.46] starting in October
[159.46 → 160.60] of this year
[160.60 → 162.28] where Android verification
[162.28 → 163.16] will enter
[163.16 → 164.52] early access.
[164.96 → 166.92] In March 2026,
[167.22 → 168.20] it will be open
[168.20 → 169.34] to all developers.
[169.68 → 170.96] And in September 2026,
[171.70 → 172.38] these requirements
[172.38 → 173.50] will go into effect
[173.50 → 174.10] for Brazil,
[174.34 → 174.74] Indonesia,
[175.00 → 175.28] Singapore,
[175.46 → 176.30] and Thailand.
[176.54 → 176.84] Absolutely.
[176.84 → 178.74] And in 2027,
[179.08 → 180.88] this will roll out
[180.88 → 181.94] globally.
[182.70 → 183.80] Many developers
[183.80 → 184.92] are calling into question
[184.92 → 186.06] the reasoning for this
[186.06 → 187.34] since in the Android
[187.34 → 188.46] developers blog post
[188.46 → 189.70] written by Suzanne Frey,
[190.10 → 191.58] VP of product trust
[191.58 → 192.26] and growth for Android,
[192.36 → 192.76] she states,
[192.76 → 194.44] think of it,
[195.08 → 195.94] um,
[196.64 → 197.06] oh sorry,
[197.28 → 197.92] written by,
[198.06 → 199.06] think of it like
[199.06 → 200.16] an ID check
[200.16 → 200.78] at the airport
[200.78 → 201.80] which confirms
[201.80 → 202.88] a traveller's identity
[202.88 → 203.84] but is separate
[203.84 → 204.66] from the security
[204.66 → 205.62] screening of their bags.
[206.28 → 207.52] We'll be confirming
[207.52 → 208.98] who the developer is,
[209.10 → 210.32] not reviewing
[210.32 → 211.08] the content
[211.08 → 211.80] of their app
[211.80 → 212.70] or where it came from.
[212.90 → 213.54] Now hold on
[213.54 → 214.52] just a gosh darn second.
[214.52 → 217.28] How do you differentiate
[217.28 → 218.98] in the case
[218.98 → 220.00] of an app
[220.00 → 221.46] the difference
[221.46 → 222.12] between
[222.12 → 224.32] where it came from
[224.32 → 225.98] and who developed it?
[226.54 → 226.74] Huh?
[227.70 → 228.18] I,
[228.34 → 229.12] I,
[229.24 → 230.70] I question you this.
[231.20 → 232.08] I don't think
[232.08 → 233.00] the where it came from
[233.00 → 233.74] even matters
[233.74 → 234.40] which is probably
[234.40 → 235.28] why they don't care.
[235.68 → 236.70] Her analogy
[236.70 → 238.30] makes no sense.
[238.48 → 238.70] No.
[238.86 → 239.72] Think of it like
[239.72 → 240.84] an ID check
[240.84 → 241.66] at the airport
[241.66 → 242.74] which confirms
[242.74 → 244.12] a traveller's identity
[244.12 → 245.62] but is separate
[245.62 → 247.52] from the security
[247.52 → 248.68] screening of their bags.
[248.92 → 250.26] So we'll be confirming
[250.26 → 252.10] who the developer is
[252.10 → 253.56] not reviewing
[253.56 → 254.20] the content
[254.20 → 254.94] of their app
[254.94 → 256.38] or where it came from
[256.38 → 258.28] but is not
[258.28 → 260.42] where it came from
[260.42 → 261.36] the developer.
[263.42 → 263.98] I,
[264.10 → 264.18] no,
[264.22 → 265.24] I think they mean like
[265.24 → 266.10] uh,
[266.10 → 267.50] was this on a
[267.50 → 268.88] SDK download site?
[269.00 → 269.62] I think they mean
[269.62 → 270.36] where was the
[270.36 → 272.02] the source
[272.02 → 272.84] that the user
[272.84 → 273.56] got it from?
[273.56 → 274.74] Not necessarily
[274.74 → 275.86] did they get it
[275.86 → 276.52] directly from the creator?
[276.62 → 277.58] I think that's what she means.
[277.98 → 279.30] Does it matter?
[280.64 → 281.08] No,
[281.66 → 282.52] in my opinion.
[282.96 → 284.16] There are more details
[284.16 → 284.70] to come
[284.70 → 286.60] but what we're expecting
[286.60 → 287.48] based on what we know
[287.48 → 288.06] so far is
[288.06 → 288.60] this will work
[288.60 → 289.56] similar to Apple
[289.56 → 290.22] in the EU.
[290.64 → 291.44] Apple recently
[291.44 → 292.28] was mandated
[292.28 → 293.06] to allow
[293.06 → 293.60] sideloading
[293.60 → 294.20] on their devices
[294.20 → 295.10] using a similar
[295.10 → 296.76] verification method.
[296.76 → 298.74] this did not
[298.74 → 299.42] prevent Apple
[299.42 → 299.74] however
[299.74 → 300.66] from removing
[300.66 → 301.60] a popular
[301.60 → 302.40] tormenting app
[302.40 → 303.14] torrent
[303.14 → 304.30] from alt store
[304.30 → 304.76] pal
[304.76 → 305.60] which is a popular
[305.60 → 306.82] alternative app store
[306.82 → 307.86] for iPhone.
[307.86 → 309.38] So basically
[309.38 → 311.52] what this looks like
[311.52 → 312.06] to me
[312.06 → 313.08] is that
[313.08 → 314.46] Google has been
[314.46 → 315.26] carefully
[315.26 → 316.04] watching
[316.04 → 317.18] from the
[317.18 → 318.44] sort of sidelines
[318.44 → 319.56] like if you think back
[319.56 → 320.10] to when
[320.10 → 320.54] Epic
[320.54 → 321.86] sued Apple
[321.86 → 323.32] and Google
[323.32 → 323.64] see
[323.64 → 325.14] people kind of forget
[325.14 → 326.04] that Epic
[326.04 → 327.50] sued both of them
[327.50 → 328.08] because Apple
[328.08 → 328.74] is a much more
[328.74 → 330.10] exciting headline
[330.10 → 330.60] and
[330.60 → 331.90] you know
[331.90 → 332.58] forming
[332.58 → 334.50] finding any cracks
[334.50 → 335.16] in Apple's
[335.16 → 335.78] walled garden
[335.78 → 336.92] was a much more
[336.92 → 337.94] tantalizing
[337.94 → 338.84] you know Apple
[338.84 → 339.66] but
[339.66 → 340.50] no Epic
[340.50 → 341.38] very much sued
[341.38 → 342.08] both Apple
[342.08 → 342.96] and Google
[342.96 → 343.92] over the
[343.92 → 345.22] monopolies
[345.22 → 345.76] of their
[345.76 → 347.82] various ecosystems
[347.82 → 349.50] and it seems
[349.50 → 349.86] to me
[349.86 → 350.38] like Google
[350.38 → 351.24] has been watching
[351.24 → 352.96] extremely
[352.96 → 354.08] interestedly
[354.08 → 354.96] from the
[354.96 → 355.50] kind of
[355.50 → 356.06] sidelines
[356.06 → 356.48] to see
[356.48 → 357.60] what exactly
[357.60 → 358.08] it is
[358.08 → 358.46] that Apple
[358.46 → 358.98] can get away
[358.98 → 359.44] with here
[359.44 → 361.00] to see
[361.00 → 361.72] what they
[361.72 → 362.36] can also
[362.36 → 362.92] lock down
[362.92 → 363.38] and I think
[363.38 → 363.84] we're just
[363.84 → 364.54] kind of
[364.54 → 365.70] arriving at
[365.70 → 366.40] the logical
[366.40 → 367.02] conclusion
[367.02 → 367.82] which is that
[367.82 → 368.46] well okay
[368.46 → 369.24] if this is
[369.24 → 369.54] where the
[369.54 → 370.12] line is going
[370.12 → 370.52] to be
[370.52 → 371.14] then we
[371.14 → 371.54] might as
[371.54 → 371.86] well be
[371.86 → 372.06] there
[372.06 → 372.46] but I
[372.46 → 372.92] gotta say
[372.92 → 373.46] as someone
[373.46 → 374.02] who very
[374.02 → 374.28] much
[374.28 → 375.04] enjoys
[375.04 → 375.74] the
[375.74 → 376.48] side load
[376.48 → 376.86] ability
[376.86 → 377.70] of apps
[377.70 → 378.36] for Android
[378.36 → 378.86] I
[378.86 → 381.14] I don't
[381.14 → 381.44] really know
[381.44 → 381.66] what to
[381.66 → 381.96] do
[381.96 → 383.26] about this
[383.26 → 383.70] what does
[383.70 → 384.18] this actually
[384.18 → 384.84] change
[384.84 → 386.88] because like
[386.88 → 387.74] if they're not
[387.74 → 388.44] inspecting the
[388.44 → 389.24] contents of the
[389.24 → 389.54] app
[389.54 → 390.52] they're just
[390.52 → 391.06] checking who
[391.06 → 391.64] it's signed
[391.64 → 392.12] by
[392.12 → 395.40] who cares
[395.40 → 397.46] that's
[397.46 → 398.18] wow that's a
[398.18 → 398.62] hot take
[398.62 → 399.16] and a half
[399.16 → 399.52] but I
[399.52 → 400.04] certain
[400.04 → 400.76] developers
[400.76 → 401.20] that they're
[401.20 → 401.54] going to
[401.54 → 401.88] allow
[401.88 → 402.24] like what
[402.24 → 402.78] is the
[402.78 → 403.58] next step
[403.58 → 404.10] in this
[404.10 → 404.56] effectively
[404.56 → 405.44] like is it
[405.44 → 405.82] going to be
[405.82 → 406.22] an aglow
[406.22 → 406.60] list
[406.60 → 407.54] so you have
[407.54 → 407.88] to be a
[407.88 → 408.20] known
[408.20 → 408.68] publisher
[408.68 → 409.24] by the
[409.24 → 409.72] Google Play
[409.72 → 410.06] store
[410.06 → 410.48] in order
[410.48 → 411.16] to be
[411.16 → 411.44] side
[411.44 → 411.74] loaded
[411.74 → 414.92] the end
[414.92 → 415.50] of advanced
[415.50 → 415.92] if side
[415.92 → 416.28] loading is
[416.28 → 416.48] gone
[416.48 → 417.16] yeah so
[417.16 → 417.50] like they
[417.50 → 417.74] might
[417.74 → 418.46] preemptively
[418.46 → 418.96] ban
[418.96 → 419.58] certain
[419.58 → 420.14] developers
[420.14 → 421.38] but then
[421.38 → 422.28] could you
[422.28 → 424.64] just sign
[424.64 → 425.22] as a
[425.22 → 425.46] different
[425.46 → 425.94] developer
[425.94 → 427.00] but then
[427.00 → 427.48] you would
[427.48 → 428.32] also probably
[428.32 → 429.06] get banned
[429.06 → 429.52] for
[429.52 → 430.42] introducing
[430.42 → 431.22] some app
[431.22 → 431.56] that they
[431.56 → 432.16] don't approve
[432.16 → 432.44] of
[432.44 → 432.94] and then
[432.94 → 433.26] but they're
[433.26 → 433.62] saying that
[433.62 → 433.86] they're not
[433.86 → 434.44] inspecting the
[434.44 → 434.76] apps
[434.76 → 436.38] sure but
[436.38 → 436.88] like come
[436.88 → 437.18] on how
[437.18 → 437.52] long is
[437.52 → 437.94] that gonna
[437.94 → 438.14] last
[438.14 → 438.76] well that's
[438.76 → 439.30] what that's
[439.30 → 439.50] what I'm
[439.50 → 439.92] saying is
[439.92 → 440.38] like as
[440.38 → 440.80] its current
[440.80 → 441.22] state doesn't
[441.22 → 441.56] feel like it
[441.56 → 442.14] does anything
[442.14 → 442.84] so what is
[442.84 → 443.22] their next
[443.22 → 443.52] step
[443.52 → 444.68] I guess I
[444.68 → 444.98] didn't lay
[444.98 → 445.26] that I
[445.26 → 445.64] mean getting
[445.64 → 446.14] rid of apps
[446.14 → 446.48] they don't
[446.48 → 447.06] like because
[447.06 → 447.72] otherwise well
[447.72 → 448.12] what would
[448.12 → 448.64] be what
[448.64 → 449.08] would be the
[449.08 → 449.96] point I
[449.96 → 450.44] don't like
[450.44 → 451.70] it what I
[451.70 → 451.90] want to
[451.90 → 452.26] follow this
[452.26 → 452.58] up with
[452.58 → 453.44] is how's
[453.44 → 453.82] graphene
[453.82 → 455.12] going oh
[455.12 → 455.64] because honestly
[455.64 → 456.60] immediately upon
[456.60 → 457.22] reading this I
[457.22 → 457.72] was just like
[457.72 → 458.74] it's just another
[458.74 → 459.38] flag that I
[459.38 → 459.76] need to get
[459.76 → 460.66] out so
[460.66 → 461.96] graphene's
[461.96 → 462.78] cool yes
[462.78 → 464.30] as we talked
[464.30 → 465.24] about offline
[465.24 → 466.34] we do
[466.34 → 467.18] have lives
[467.18 → 467.76] outside
[467.76 → 468.16] WAN show
[468.16 → 468.50] where we
[468.50 → 469.00] occasionally
[469.00 → 469.78] communicate with
[469.78 → 470.08] each other
[470.08 → 470.58] outside
[470.58 → 471.18] WAN show so
[471.18 → 472.24] as we talked
[472.24 → 472.96] about already
[472.96 → 474.58] there is a
[474.58 → 475.08] way to get
[475.08 → 475.66] call screening
[475.66 → 476.22] you can just
[476.22 → 477.08] like get
[477.08 → 478.18] the pixel
[478.18 → 479.20] dialler app and
[479.20 → 479.76] it'll just like
[479.76 → 480.48] include pixel
[480.48 → 481.68] features and
[481.68 → 482.36] the graphene
[482.36 → 483.44] OS team's
[483.44 → 484.14] sort of
[484.14 → 485.60] position on
[485.60 → 486.70] installing apps
[486.70 → 487.34] like Facebook
[487.34 → 489.20] or apps like
[489.20 → 489.68] the pixel
[489.68 → 490.72] dialler is that
[490.72 → 491.50] oh well you
[491.50 → 491.86] know yeah
[491.86 → 493.00] okay you're
[493.00 → 493.98] you are giving
[493.98 → 494.84] up some of the
[494.84 → 495.80] privacy that you
[495.80 → 496.50] might have with
[496.50 → 497.12] graphene OS
[497.12 → 497.52] sorry I keep
[497.52 → 497.88] picking up
[497.88 → 498.48] holding up this
[498.48 → 498.94] phone but
[498.94 → 500.00] it's on another
[500.00 → 500.26] one
[500.26 → 501.60] you are giving
[501.60 → 502.20] up some of
[502.20 → 503.32] the privacy
[503.32 → 504.20] that you might
[504.20 → 505.02] normally have
[505.02 → 505.64] with graphene
[505.64 → 506.80] OS by
[506.80 → 507.60] installing those
[507.60 → 508.28] things but it
[508.28 → 509.26] is most
[509.26 → 510.38] certainly
[510.38 → 511.18] assuredly
[511.18 → 512.32] better than
[512.32 → 513.50] running those
[513.50 → 514.48] applications in
[514.48 → 515.86] a not sandboxed
[515.86 → 516.50] version of
[516.50 → 518.54] Google's services
[518.54 → 519.74] and ecosystem
[519.74 → 520.90] I had originally
[520.90 → 521.82] been like well if
[521.82 → 522.30] I'm going to like
[522.30 → 523.00] compromise the
[523.00 → 524.24] wall why bother
[524.24 → 524.96] but then ever
[524.96 → 525.64] since hearing that
[525.64 → 526.18] statement it's been
[526.18 → 526.72] like all right I'm
[526.72 → 527.24] gonna wait for you
[527.24 → 527.68] to finish
[527.68 → 528.70] yeah but I
[528.70 → 529.50] might dive in
[529.50 → 530.86] I am already
[530.86 → 531.90] running into some
[531.90 → 533.52] issues so here's
[533.52 → 534.38] an interesting one
[534.38 → 534.84] I don't necessarily
[534.84 → 535.52] mind some
[535.52 → 536.30] issues so
[536.30 → 537.74] off for instance
[537.74 → 539.26] okay if I try to
[539.26 → 540.22] sign into it so
[540.22 → 541.62] let's go ahead and
[541.62 → 545.90] oh nope that is
[545.90 → 546.50] not my correct
[546.50 → 547.02] phone number
[547.02 → 551.16] uh here I'm just
[551.16 → 551.70] going to get the
[551.70 → 552.82] exact right number
[552.82 → 556.36] ah yes this device
[556.36 → 557.32] does not meet the
[557.32 → 558.44] minimum integrity
[558.44 → 561.16] requirements so it
[561.16 → 562.54] turns out that there
[562.54 → 564.36] are some ways that
[564.36 → 565.96] Google does attempt
[565.96 → 567.40] to exert some
[567.40 → 569.54] control over
[569.54 → 571.24] device security in
[571.24 → 572.58] this particular case
[572.58 → 575.70] there is not as
[575.70 → 576.64] far as I'm aware
[576.64 → 578.30] not a meaningful
[578.30 → 579.58] impact on the
[579.58 → 581.30] actual security of
[581.30 → 582.90] that particular API
[582.90 → 584.80] that off is
[584.80 → 587.00] utilizing but if
[587.00 → 587.88] app developers
[587.88 → 589.14] sorry I might have
[589.14 → 589.58] missed something you
[589.58 → 590.84] said Google uh
[590.84 → 592.04] off's so is this
[592.04 → 593.38] is this off's using
[593.38 → 594.24] like uh like a
[594.24 → 595.64] secure check API
[595.64 → 596.26] of some sort I
[596.26 → 596.76] forget what it's
[596.76 → 597.44] called from Google
[597.44 → 598.88] got it yeah so
[598.88 → 602.86] you're not stuck
[602.86 → 604.20] with off I can
[604.20 → 605.00] migrate off of
[605.00 → 605.82] off in fact I
[605.82 → 606.86] chose off like
[606.86 → 607.58] back before they
[607.58 → 608.76] were acquired and
[608.76 → 610.10] it was a whole it
[610.10 → 610.62] was a whole thing it
[610.62 → 611.48] was a good choice at
[611.48 → 612.40] the time it was like
[612.40 → 613.40] the choice at the
[613.40 → 614.52] time and since then
[614.52 → 615.18] I think people have
[615.18 → 616.24] moved on mostly to
[616.24 → 618.14] like enter I think
[618.14 → 618.72] I think that's how
[618.72 → 619.44] it's pronounced yeah
[619.44 → 621.60] so I can there's a
[621.60 → 623.12] few now yeah so I
[623.12 → 624.16] could definitely move
[624.16 → 625.06] off of if it's not a
[625.06 → 626.32] dealbreaker, but it's
[626.32 → 627.74] just one app that I've
[627.74 → 629.42] found that due to a
[629.42 → 630.62] choice by the app
[630.62 → 632.72] maker simply will not
[632.72 → 634.88] run and as far as I
[634.88 → 635.38] can tell there's no
[635.38 → 636.16] real work around for
[636.16 → 638.08] it another big category
[638.08 → 639.48] of apps that is
[639.48 → 640.44] challenging for the
[640.44 → 641.70] graphene OS team is
[641.70 → 643.92] banking apps not
[643.92 → 645.36] because again not
[645.36 → 646.78] because there's any
[646.78 → 648.00] evidence that I've yet
[648.00 → 649.60] seen that you must
[649.60 → 651.14] use this integrity
[651.14 → 652.44] API forget I keep
[652.44 → 652.94] forgetting what it's
[652.94 → 653.52] called, and I'm sorry
[653.52 → 654.98] guys play integrity
[654.98 → 655.88] API I think that's the
[655.88 → 658.28] one TZN not because
[658.28 → 659.52] as far as I can tell
[659.52 → 660.48] there's a meaningful
[660.48 → 661.82] security advantage to
[661.82 → 663.44] using it but because
[663.44 → 664.46] it is a thing that
[664.46 → 665.80] exists that some app
[665.80 → 666.88] developers have chosen
[666.88 → 668.56] to use and if they
[668.56 → 672.68] have well too bad
[672.68 → 674.90] the good news is my
[674.90 → 676.34] bank doesn't use it
[676.34 → 678.16] so that's good for me
[678.16 → 680.62] for now but
[680.62 → 683.32] yours might right so
[683.32 → 686.72] overall I'm pretty I'm
[686.72 → 688.64] I'm pretty jazzed about
[688.64 → 689.94] certain things like check
[689.94 → 692.36] this out like just how
[692.36 → 694.10] responsive it is like
[694.10 → 696.16] it's flipping how's your
[696.16 → 698.08] battery usage fast because
[698.08 → 699.62] my great my phone right
[699.62 → 701.66] now the only thing that's
[701.66 → 702.88] like sort of tempting me on
[702.88 → 704.12] getting a 10 which I don't
[704.12 → 705.10] want to do and almost
[705.10 → 707.40] certainly will not do is
[707.40 → 708.96] that my phone is usually
[708.96 → 711.36] like if I don't plug it
[711.36 → 712.98] in near the end of the
[712.98 → 714.10] night before I've gone to
[714.10 → 715.32] sleep it will die on me
[715.32 → 719.86] almost every day well part
[719.86 → 721.76] of the problem for me to
[721.76 → 724.48] kind of I don't have an
[724.48 → 725.52] apples to apples comparison
[725.52 → 726.76] for you because I'm running
[726.76 → 729.98] the 9a for both my like
[729.98 → 731.70] daily driver which I
[731.70 → 733.10] actually I finally finished
[733.10 → 734.42] signing in to all my crap on
[734.42 → 735.88] this on my recent trip so
[735.88 → 736.84] I'm going to be popping my
[736.84 → 738.84] sim in it this weekend but
[738.84 → 740.26] the pixel 9a has like
[740.26 → 742.48] fricking legendary battery
[742.48 → 745.40] life like I'm at 83% right
[745.40 → 746.66] now, and I've used it today
[746.66 → 749.68] yeah like I can barely kill
[749.68 → 751.06] this thing in a day if I
[751.06 → 753.02] try yeah this thing's been a
[753.02 → 754.92] bit of a tank the whole time
[754.92 → 758.36] and I do like it's pretty
[758.36 → 760.90] common like this is just
[760.90 → 762.40] because I didn't plug my
[762.40 → 763.40] phone in last night right
[763.40 → 766.16] it's pretty common that I'll
[766.16 → 768.58] like go for a walk or
[768.58 → 769.60] something when I do that I'll
[769.60 → 770.74] play Pokémon Go and that'll
[770.74 → 772.34] battery hog like crazy so that
[772.34 → 773.50] kind of makes sense okay that's
[773.50 → 775.14] what you get no for sure
[775.14 → 779.14] gamer time but even when
[779.14 → 781.38] I don't it's its pretty bad
[781.38 → 785.76] yeah all right well anyway I
[785.76 → 788.74] guess oh man what's gonna
[788.74 → 790.64] happen if I had to make a bold
[790.64 → 793.70] prediction I mean graphene OS is
[793.70 → 796.58] already a thing do we see more
[796.58 → 798.30] mainstream acceptance of
[798.30 → 800.62] alternative androids like do we
[800.62 → 803.00] go back to all the cool kids
[803.00 → 806.14] running cyanogen mod hopefully
[806.14 → 808.34] hopefully because so far it does
[808.34 → 809.34] feel like there's a bit of a
[809.34 → 811.94] wave going on I do to give them
[811.94 → 814.22] credit not to not give
[814.22 → 815.50] them credit to actually straight
[815.50 → 816.98] up give them credit I think a lot
[816.98 → 820.38] of it is uh steam OS just
[820.38 → 822.92] normalizing Linux usage sure but I
[822.92 → 824.40] think also just Windows being
[824.40 → 827.94] really annoying and the mobile
[827.94 → 831.10] platforms getting more overtly
[831.10 → 834.84] anti-user instead of just kind of
[834.84 → 837.00] like shrugging it off with these
[837.00 → 838.02] lawsuits going on and then
[838.02 → 839.28] fighting it so hard and like
[839.28 → 840.64] clearly trying to skirt right
[840.64 → 842.10] along legal boundaries and stuff
[842.10 → 843.08] like that most people aren't
[843.08 → 844.24] paying any attention to that
[844.24 → 846.08] though yeah, but it's starting you
[846.08 → 848.16] you get the hardcore and the
[848.16 → 849.94] enthusiasts first sure then it
[849.94 → 851.44] leaks a little bit I don't I
[851.44 → 853.34] don't ever think a thing that you
[853.34 → 856.26] have to mod is going to be fully
[856.26 → 857.62] mainstream at pretty much any
[857.62 → 860.98] point but what if someone
[860.98 → 862.86] could deliver a pre-modded product
[862.86 → 864.30] so you know what if the
[864.30 → 865.90] asking OS team if you hit a
[865.90 → 867.28] certain amount of enthusiasts
[867.28 → 870.62] gets hardware interest then those
[870.62 → 871.70] types of things become more and
[871.70 → 874.18] more viable it's gonna oh man
[874.18 → 876.12] that'd be a huge tipping point
[876.12 → 879.66] because like the edge that Google
[879.66 → 882.40] has and that Apple has it's in the
[882.40 → 884.66] cameraman yeah it's in the camera
[884.66 → 887.10] and so like that's been a
[887.10 → 888.62] differentiating feature for phones
[888.62 → 890.92] for so long, and it is genuinely
[890.92 → 892.90] important even to armies who don't
[892.90 → 895.34] really care that much about anything
[895.34 → 897.62] else to do with their phone like if
[897.62 → 900.38] it didn't matter we so many more of
[900.38 → 903.50] us would be using Vivo phones or
[903.50 → 907.74] Honour or whatever else and I know
[907.74 → 909.18] there are markets where those brands
[909.18 → 910.70] are more popular but at least in
[910.70 → 912.68] North America man the camera seems to
[912.68 → 916.00] be just such a huge selling point and
[916.00 → 919.26] other than the big players it's its
[919.26 → 921.14] pretty tough to deliver an outstanding
[921.14 → 922.98] camera experience
[922.98 → 928.60] then again yeah I mean that's a really
[928.60 → 929.48] great point
[929.48 → 932.12] in flow plane chat is if the camera
[932.12 → 935.26] mattered so much then Sony shouldn't
[935.82 → 937.48] Sony shouldn't have faulted the way
[937.48 → 938.72] that they did I mean they had
[938.72 → 940.26] pretty outstanding cameras so it's
[940.26 → 941.54] it's going to be it's hard for me to
[941.54 → 943.70] predict what the future will hold but
[943.70 → 946.08] honestly I think most people these
[946.08 → 948.70] days genuinely where would I put it
[948.70 → 952.10] I think it's all I think it's fair to
[952.10 → 954.38] say over 75% are just buying out of
[954.38 → 958.30] habit oh dude that's huge okay so
[958.30 → 959.60] there's definitely some weirdness I
[959.60 → 963.14] just opened Facebook whoa, and it's
[963.14 → 965.76] just it's just flipping out session
[965.76 → 968.54] expired log back in I bet let's see
[968.54 → 972.42] it's logging out now okay did we do it
[972.42 → 977.46] it so has it been the most seamless of
[977.46 → 980.18] experiences no Dan can you do me a
[980.18 → 982.44] super huge solid favour and kind of
[982.44 → 984.38] mark this time stamp and email that to
[984.38 → 987.28] me for my graphene OS video it's its
[987.28 → 989.36] dude it's so frustrating it's hard
[989.36 → 992.04] sometimes for me to catch some of the
[992.04 → 994.34] behaviour that I notice on devices as
[994.34 → 995.92] I'm working through reviewing them or
[995.92 → 998.18] daily driving them, and so I'll, you know
[998.18 → 999.50] I'll go out on camera, and I'll say
[999.50 → 1001.38] yeah the latest iOS is like a glitchy
[1001.38 → 1004.14] piece of shit and people be like I
[1004.14 → 1005.26] don't know what you're talking about
[1005.26 → 1006.62] it's like well okay, but that doesn't
[1006.62 → 1009.58] change that that was my experience and
[1009.58 → 1011.02] so it's its great when I can like
[1011.02 → 1013.18] document these things that are just
[1013.18 → 1016.98] unequivocally weird buggy behaviour the
[1016.98 → 1020.32] Facebook app should never do that that's
[1020.32 → 1023.62] not a feature of the Facebook app to move
[1023.62 → 1025.84] around like that yeah when you first open
[1025.84 → 1029.10] it oh this is, but you probably don't
[1029.10 → 1030.60] need the Facebook app so maybe you'll be
[1030.60 → 1034.26] okay I don't know if I care because
[1034.26 → 1038.46] like if a very small number of apps work
[1038.46 → 1041.56] fine mm-hmm if all the rest of them
[1041.56 → 1044.26] have glitchy bugs that's probably a good
[1044.26 → 1047.04] thing overall if I could like designate
[1047.04 → 1049.78] on my phone interesting I want this
[1049.78 → 1051.80] particular app to like error out
[1051.80 → 1054.58] relatively often I would probably do that
[1054.58 → 1058.06] I'm not even kidding because there are
[1058.06 → 1059.36] certain things that I like to have to have
[1059.36 → 1061.10] installed, but I don't want them installed
[1061.10 → 1063.10] and I have to use them for like work and
[1063.10 → 1064.70] then they might distract me and if it was
[1064.70 → 1067.36] just like error out I'd be like oh right
[1067.36 → 1069.24] I need to go do something else anyway
[1069.24 → 1073.08] okay um I think that setting screen time
[1073.08 → 1075.40] limits and I do that yeah sure I just
[1075.40 → 1077.20] think that might be a better approach than
[1077.20 → 1079.48] just this app that I'm just saying I
[1079.48 → 1081.48] don't think it's going to bother me crashes
[1081.48 → 1084.40] I don't think it's going to bother me uh I
[1084.40 → 1088.72] mean it's probably me to log back in do
[1088.72 → 1091.32] you do you not get bothered when you have
[1091.32 → 1093.72] to log into something to the main
[1093.72 → 1097.58] Facebook app uh no I don't think it's
[1097.58 → 1099.62] going to bother me if messages did that I
[1099.62 → 1101.66] would get annoyed okay so you don't get
[1101.66 → 1103.86] to pick which apps glitch do I have you
[1103.86 → 1105.38] don't get to pick how they glitch but
[1105.38 → 1107.00] that's why I said it if very specific
[1107.00 → 1110.02] ones worked totally fine okay then sure
[1110.02 → 1113.26] yeah do I have the yeah I have the main
[1113.26 → 1114.40] Facebook app I don't think I've ever
[1114.40 → 1116.50] used it do you must need it for like
[1116.50 → 1120.82] see there's always like a thing on it
[1120.82 → 1122.76] that I need, and then it has 30 other
[1122.76 → 1124.40] things that are really annoying and then
[1124.40 → 1126.22] it will send the notifications and stuff
[1126.22 → 1128.24] for the other things and I don't want
[1128.24 → 1129.56] them yeah I'm going to have to figure this
[1129.56 → 1130.76] out because it's like doing it every
[1130.76 → 1133.32] time every time I click login it's like
[1133.32 → 1134.62] flipping its biz
[1134.62 → 1138.64] this is not something that I
[1138.64 → 1142.12] had encountered so far okay am I quite
[1142.12 → 1145.82] ready to put the sim in it sure you know
[1145.82 → 1147.64] what I'll go for it, and I'll just not
[1147.64 → 1150.44] use Facebook I guess nice good luck
[1150.44 → 1153.40] everybody, but you know how much I love
[1153.40 → 1155.86] marketplace I wish there was a
[1155.86 → 1157.16] separate marketplace app, but they'll
[1157.16 → 1158.34] never do that because they want you to
[1158.34 → 1159.86] see all the other jobs that's right
[1159.86 → 1162.74] that's how they get ya all right why
[1162.74 → 1164.98] don't we jump into our next topic you
[1164.98 → 1168.62] want to pick it sure battlefield okay
[1168.62 → 1171.52] we're talking about I know nothing
[1171.52 → 1174.08] about so I guess Luke's going to be leading
[1174.08 → 1176.12] this time battlefield in the past right I
[1176.12 → 1180.42] have played honestly for this discussion
[1180.42 → 1185.30] like the older, the better about hold on
[1185.30 → 1186.86] let me think let me check what the cover
[1186.86 → 1189.80] art was which should give you some idea
[1189.80 → 1192.64] because it came in a box I'm assuming
[1192.64 → 1198.60] it's 1942 I played maybe an hour or two of
[1198.60 → 1203.92] battlefield 2 okay sure so battlefield 3
[1203.92 → 1208.32] battlefield 4 eras and no I played a
[1208.32 → 1209.92] little bit of battlefield 4 that's the
[1209.92 → 1211.42] one with the destructible environments
[1211.42 → 1213.12] right you sure you never played 1942
[1213.12 → 1215.76] everybody played 1942 load up the box art
[1215.76 → 1217.66] load up the box art do you know how it
[1217.66 → 1221.04] makes people feel when you say everyone
[1221.04 → 1223.02] something load up the box art you know
[1223.02 → 1226.70] everyone loves ice cream and then if you
[1226.70 → 1228.12] don't love ice cream do you hate it when I say that
[1228.12 → 1229.88] and then if you don't love ice cream do you
[1229.88 → 1231.62] hate it when I say that you feel left out
[1231.62 → 1234.58] you feel isolated like you're not
[1234.58 → 1236.78] one of everyone left out for not playing
[1236.78 → 1240.76] 1942 literally everyone you know if I said
[1240.76 → 1243.06] everyone has an LTT screwdriver you'd be
[1243.06 → 1247.60] like you don't exaggerate stuff you
[1247.60 → 1249.86] crying right now is not an exaggeration at
[1249.86 → 1250.14] all
[1250.14 → 1258.60] no I never played 1942 okay basically 3 4 and
[1258.60 → 1264.76] before huh all had server browsers and at
[1264.76 → 1268.40] least some maps that were enormous shut up
[1268.40 → 1272.72] what are they bringing back like
[1272.72 → 1276.92] like a server list like can can people
[1276.92 → 1278.64] host their own servers they're bringing
[1278.64 → 1282.70] back server browsers what so the battlefield
[1282.70 → 1285.62] 6 open beta that just this is news from like
[1285.62 → 1287.40] 10 hours that's illegal the battlefield 6
[1287.40 → 1289.78] that's illegal that happened they had two of
[1289.78 → 1291.86] them recently stop it there was no server
[1291.86 → 1293.88] browser you can't tell me something like this
[1293.88 → 1297.18] and then fucking rug pull me you can't, it's
[1297.18 → 1299.24] not okay we'll get there we'll get there
[1299.24 → 1303.30] there were no server browsers I k I do not
[1303.30 → 1305.62] get a full release you are responsible for my
[1305.62 → 1306.12] blue balls
[1306.12 → 1313.56] okay it is only partial but in my opinion
[1313.56 → 1316.04] it's a nice and partial that is only is
[1316.04 → 1318.10] completely fine that should in my opinion
[1318.10 → 1319.26] still give full release
[1319.26 → 1323.26] okay carry on so in those play tests there
[1323.26 → 1324.94] was two main problems that I had a bunch of
[1324.94 → 1326.22] problems, but there are two main problems that
[1326.22 → 1328.92] I had okayed the biggest most important one
[1328.92 → 1332.36] was no server browser my reason for that is
[1332.36 → 1335.78] battlefield is a very varied game back in
[1335.78 → 1337.86] the day all the maps were enormous and had
[1337.86 → 1339.98] tons of vehicles and then as it started
[1339.98 → 1341.32] getting more modern they got smaller and
[1341.32 → 1343.30] smaller maps trying to compete with cod and
[1343.30 → 1345.40] that was kind of okay but if you didn't feel
[1345.40 → 1347.40] like playing a small map you could just
[1347.40 → 1349.50] server browser and go to some 24-7 server
[1349.50 → 1352.64] and play whatever map you wanted as long
[1352.64 → 1354.50] as you wanted right, and then they took
[1354.50 → 1356.12] server browser away and right around that
[1356.12 → 1359.20] same time battlefield went the six open
[1359.20 → 1361.42] beta had no server browser and had a lot
[1361.42 → 1363.86] of tiny maps even their like
[1363.86 → 1368.12] the biggest map honestly felt like one area of
[1368.12 → 1369.90] one of the old huge maps in the old
[1369.90 → 1370.16] games
[1370.16 → 1374.02] jets like you could have permanent
[1374.02 → 1375.88] visibility on a jet as it flew around
[1375.88 → 1377.68] the map because the map was so small like
[1377.68 → 1379.48] just didn't seem it didn't feel right
[1379.48 → 1381.34] right in a battlefield it was more of a
[1381.34 → 1385.18] battle area I don't know that old
[1385.18 → 1389.98] position room yeah there you go cubby so
[1389.98 → 1393.46] people wanted bigger maps and people
[1393.46 → 1395.82] wanted a server browser and then this
[1395.82 → 1398.82] article from rock paper shotgun appeared
[1398.82 → 1402.74] on oh my with all the ads appeared on my
[1402.74 → 1404.78] device battlefield 6 is getting persistent
[1404.78 → 1407.28] servers and two vehicle heavy maps are
[1407.28 → 1409.92] coming in the next labs play test 24-7
[1409.92 → 1411.78] insert map here only listings here we come
[1411.78 → 1416.24] so the asterisk as a couple of people
[1416.24 → 1418.84] in float plane chat have pointed out is
[1418.84 → 1422.06] that these persistent servers are for
[1422.06 → 1427.28] portal which is like that's a whole other
[1427.28 → 1433.08] game user create this is like this is like
[1433.08 → 1435.94] battlefields version of halo forge so
[1435.94 → 1439.82] it's user defined rules maps basically
[1439.82 → 1442.12] yeah, but that's what custom servers always
[1442.12 → 1444.56] were anyway yeah pointed out like it's not
[1444.56 → 1447.08] the main modes yes it's like I don't know if I
[1447.08 → 1450.00] care well yeah I mean 90% of them are
[1450.00 → 1452.20] going to be some bullshit mode that is
[1452.20 → 1454.08] stupid yeah but then there will just be
[1454.08 → 1457.64] like 24-7 this 24-7 domination this map
[1457.64 → 1460.70] yeah that it's like sick that's what I
[1460.70 → 1462.78] want to play right let's go that's all I
[1462.78 → 1467.98] want, and it's totally fine, so I am very
[1467.98 → 1469.60] excited about this I'm excited that they're
[1469.60 → 1472.98] doing vehicle heavy maps because vehicle
[1472.98 → 1476.84] heavy maps almost always tie into larger
[1476.84 → 1479.96] maps and I think they need both it was
[1479.96 → 1482.02] weird when there would be like one jet on
[1482.02 → 1483.84] in the air on each team because I remember
[1483.84 → 1485.14] back in the day you like spawn at the
[1485.14 → 1487.56] airfield and there's like a few jets two
[1487.56 → 1489.74] helicopters maybe two large helicopters
[1489.74 → 1492.42] and one small helicopter a like row of
[1492.42 → 1495.84] tanks like it was very vehicle heavy and
[1495.84 → 1497.52] the maps they've rolled out have been
[1497.52 → 1499.76] small and not very vehicle heavy so yeah
[1499.76 → 1502.44] bigger hopefully they didn't say that part
[1502.44 → 1503.98] but they said vehicle heavy so hopefully
[1503.98 → 1506.24] bigger definitely vehicle heavy maps are
[1506.24 → 1509.80] coming the next play test and the like
[1509.80 → 1513.26] actual important part is the persistent
[1513.26 → 1518.02] servers that's huge that's very huge
[1518.02 → 1519.82] that's interesting so do you think part of
[1519.82 → 1522.98] this is looking at like the war funders and
[1522.98 → 1525.80] world of tanks and cods of the world
[1525.80 → 1529.44] basically going okay there is a smorgasbord
[1529.44 → 1533.70] of pointy gunny exploded at other guy
[1533.70 → 1537.54] ka boom go die go bye-bye like games at this
[1537.54 → 1542.74] point you know what do we do at this to
[1542.74 → 1544.76] differentiate ourselves because just
[1545.48 → 1549.60] having good gun play I think you
[1549.60 → 1551.30] just take that for granted nobody's gonna
[1551.30 → 1552.70] these days nobody's gonna look at you
[1552.70 → 1555.94] twice if you don't offer satisfying
[1555.94 → 1558.08] shooting mechanics got attachments cool
[1558.08 → 1559.50] reload animations all that kind of stuff
[1559.50 → 1561.32] yeah all that stuff solved for quite a while
[1561.32 → 1565.12] it's just that that's a given yeah so could
[1565.12 → 1568.52] this be and is this what you were hoping
[1568.52 → 1571.54] would be so exciting could this be a
[1571.54 → 1576.04] turning point where these guys go oh crap
[1576.04 → 1580.28] okay battlefield is stealing some of our
[1580.28 → 1583.60] market share by going back in time and
[1583.60 → 1587.40] doing things that players like maybe that's
[1587.40 → 1590.14] an idea that's worth exploring to do things
[1590.14 → 1599.38] that players like yeah sorry one sec yeah I
[1599.38 → 1603.16] know so yeah I think, so I think it's its
[1603.16 → 1604.92] an interesting turning point I genuinely
[1604.92 → 1608.20] like name a triple-a shooter that
[1608.20 → 1610.62] you've been excited about Halo Infinite
[1610.62 → 1617.50] that was good I still like it, I was
[1617.50 → 1618.96] playing the other day how high would you
[1618.96 → 1624.32] rate it ah name the last triple-a game
[1624.32 → 1625.78] that you don't have to do that plus or
[1625.78 → 1629.18] B plus when someone asks you how would you
[1629.18 → 1633.90] rate it okay hold on let me think a
[1633.90 → 1638.08] shooter yeah oh god see okay I was
[1638.08 → 1642.32] actually I was actually pretty excited for
[1642.32 → 1644.42] overwatch back when that was launching
[1644.42 → 1647.02] because it looked like Team Fortress 2 but
[1647.02 → 1651.22] like more blizzard which it's pretty much
[1651.22 → 1658.20] what it was yeah and I never yeah ah
[1658.20 → 1664.66] boo okay hold on oh god nine years okay
[1664.66 → 1668.44] well chat help me out here chat help me
[1668.44 → 1670.90] out in my determination okay basically nine
[1670.90 → 1673.50] okay I was okay it's not triple-a but I
[1673.50 → 1676.80] was excited for back for blood but then
[1676.80 → 1678.38] you also had the caveat that it was
[1678.38 → 1679.66] supposed to have been good I never
[1679.66 → 1681.22] actually played that one because I heard
[1681.22 → 1683.04] it wasn't very good everyone just played
[1683.04 → 1686.08] left for dead again which was cool for a
[1686.08 → 1696.04] little bit oh my god yeah ah wow okay I am
[1696.04 → 1701.08] split gate 2 actually triple-a no I don't
[1701.08 → 1704.98] think, so I think that's like double-a I
[1704.98 → 1709.12] think that's double-a I'm talking big names
[1709.12 → 1711.64] household name charge nuclear charge
[1711.64 → 1714.64] nuclear says Unreal Tournament okay all
[1714.64 → 1718.52] right okay, okay with that said with that
[1718.52 → 1720.68] said we should get some UT going at
[1720.68 → 1722.58] whale and that would be freaking awesome
[1722.58 → 1725.14] so yeah I basically it's been a hot
[1725.14 → 1727.14] minute and in my opinion it's because
[1727.14 → 1728.62] studio has been focusing on the wrong
[1728.62 → 1730.94] things all that kind of stuff and the
[1730.94 → 1735.06] battlefield 6 beta to me felt like maybe
[1735.06 → 1737.18] half a step in the right direction okay
[1737.18 → 1738.54] like there was a lot of things that felt
[1738.54 → 1740.42] good about it but like the lack of
[1740.42 → 1741.96] server browser the small maps all these
[1741.96 → 1743.52] different things they didn't really it
[1743.52 → 1747.76] didn't feel fully correct it's the first
[1747.76 → 1750.28] multiplayer shooter that I had some amount
[1750.28 → 1752.98] of fun playing by myself hmm which was a
[1752.98 → 1754.84] perfect sign like without grabbing a
[1754.84 → 1757.36] crew yeah I had I have a buddy that
[1757.36 → 1759.76] works on that team and I messaged him
[1759.76 → 1762.10] that being like that was a really
[1762.10 → 1763.84] interesting sign I found myself playing
[1763.84 → 1766.84] it solo and was like whoa right because I
[1766.84 → 1767.98] don't know the last time I've done that
[1767.98 → 1769.60] to a shooter I haven't even like game to
[1769.60 → 1771.88] that much not really by comparison to like
[1771.88 → 1774.52] before yeah the before four times so it
[1774.52 → 1777.40] was like it was in no small parts
[1777.40 → 1780.30] because games have kind of sucked so it's
[1780.30 → 1782.58] it's its interesting I wish I could find
[1782.58 → 1785.18] his messages because I want to see
[1785.18 → 1786.90] the other complaints that I had but
[1786.90 → 1790.10] really like above all was the map size and
[1790.10 → 1795.82] the and the and the no persistent maps all
[1795.82 → 1798.82] right well I'm hopeful oh yeah so they did
[1798.82 → 1800.44] this thing where and this will
[1800.44 → 1801.74] hopefully not happen on the persistent
[1801.74 → 1804.40] servers, but they had a thing where it
[1804.40 → 1808.00] it would autofill servers with bots and
[1808.00 → 1809.76] I actually hated that because back in the
[1809.76 → 1812.50] day it was kind of fun when like every
[1812.50 → 1814.26] single player that was on the server had
[1814.26 → 1817.92] a tank because there was only eight of
[1817.92 → 1819.96] us yep and there was, or maybe it was like
[1819.96 → 1821.62] two helicopters three tanks, and it was
[1821.62 → 1823.98] like the war of that basically that was
[1823.98 → 1825.42] fun and interesting like I didn't
[1825.42 → 1827.22] battlefield is all about the emergent
[1827.22 → 1829.64] gameplay in my opinion the only in
[1829.64 → 1831.14] battlefield was their old tagline because
[1831.14 → 1832.44] they'd show like the weird stuff you
[1832.44 → 1834.24] could do in battlefield that doesn't
[1834.24 → 1835.60] flourish when you're just stuffing it
[1835.60 → 1840.78] full of bots yeah no server browser
[1840.78 → 1843.08] map sizes suck combat generally feels
[1843.08 → 1845.94] pretty good little light and fast but
[1845.94 → 1847.70] it's not cod cancer, so I'll take it and
[1847.70 → 1848.72] it sounds like they might have even
[1848.72 → 1851.04] slowed it down the medic feels really
[1851.04 → 1855.30] cool the medic feels overpowered which I
[1855.30 → 1858.14] think is good right because when you see a
[1858.14 → 1860.24] medic you should be like oh my god let's
[1860.24 → 1862.18] war crime him basically because
[1862.18 → 1864.56] otherwise we're boned basically to be
[1864.56 → 1864.82] honest
[1864.82 → 1871.86] because like so the medic now gets
[1871.86 → 1872.40] paddles
[1872.40 → 1875.14] okay, and you can just and somebody's up
[1875.14 → 1877.62] nice which is crazy, and you can like
[1877.62 → 1879.20] you're up you're up you're up you're up
[1879.20 → 1881.12] you're up so you can like to lift a whole
[1881.12 → 1882.24] team what about Asia though
[1882.24 → 1886.14] oh my god you can get a whole team up
[1886.14 → 1888.90] really never a land war in Asia
[1888.90 → 1896.38] which is interesting because
[1896.38 → 1898.90] like you were saying if you don't take
[1898.90 → 1902.30] the medic down it's its like really
[1902.30 → 1904.16] hard to actually beat a team back right
[1904.16 → 1905.36] I think there's a certain amount of
[1905.36 → 1906.86] times that you can go down where you
[1906.86 → 1908.72] can't get brought back up anymore and I
[1908.72 → 1910.42] know that if you get headshot by a
[1910.42 → 1911.68] sniper I also thought this was a cool
[1911.68 → 1914.36] mechanic you are fatally wounded you
[1914.36 → 1915.98] can't come back oh okay that's which
[1915.98 → 1918.24] adds some interesting what if you
[1918.24 → 1920.20] headshot by not a sniper then you can
[1920.20 → 1921.66] still be brought back up interesting
[1921.66 → 1923.20] okay which is its so it's interesting
[1923.20 → 1924.70] how they have like kind of hero
[1924.70 → 1927.30] mechanics in the classes but not so
[1927.30 → 1929.40] much snipers will have a role on the
[1929.40 → 1930.78] team other than just being f***ING
[1930.78 → 1932.52] assholes who don't actually help with
[1932.52 → 1933.62] anything yeah except they'll usually
[1933.62 → 1934.54] just counter snipe each other
[1934.54 → 1936.40] permanently so they'll still fill that
[1936.40 → 1938.44] right yeah, yeah okay but some of them
[1938.44 → 1940.36] will understand like there was some
[1940.36 → 1942.70] there was a challenge where you had to
[1942.70 → 1944.20] get a certain amount of spots as a
[1944.20 → 1945.52] sniper, so I was playing sniper for a
[1945.52 → 1947.38] bit, but I played like relatively close
[1947.38 → 1950.24] range and I would really go for those
[1950.24 → 1952.56] like close combat headshots and then
[1952.56 → 1953.86] you'd see medics run up to them be like
[1953.86 → 1955.66] and it doesn't do anything and then
[1955.66 → 1956.94] you'd shoot them because you're a
[1956.94 → 1965.02] Canadian yes got it that's funny yes
[1965.02 → 1967.20] because you're a Canadian can of food
[1967.20 → 1974.80] has it been long enough can we joke about
[1974.80 → 1978.06] that is that too soon there's no way it's too soon
[1978.06 → 1981.46] right no we're fine it's been like 80 years
[1981.46 → 1986.74] oh my god nobody read up on Canadian
[1986.74 → 1989.92] history we're nice I'm sorry we said we're
[1989.92 → 1993.38] sorry what do you what do you want they were
[1993.38 → 2000.30] expired I guess okay there was no war
[2000.30 → 2003.90] crimes in the basing sea someone expired oh boy
[2003.90 → 2005.98] into pieces do you want a different kind of
[2005.98 → 2008.14] canned meat yeah you still got 22 minutes
[2008.14 → 2009.66] yeah I know, but it doesn't you have to when
[2009.66 → 2011.60] we're done the topic you have to I don't have
[2011.60 → 2013.50] do you want to just move on you still got 22
[2013.50 → 2016.30] minutes for topic two yeah I don't have the
[2016.30 → 2018.40] third one I know, but you just put whatever
[2018.40 → 2020.02] the next thing is do you want to do the
[2020.02 → 2021.06] next thing we'll do the next thing we'll do
[2021.06 → 2023.68] the next thing we don't want to drag out
[2023.68 → 2028.04] topics ah yes okay CW announce explain
[2028.04 → 2030.52] into merch messages the way to interact

[2188.42 → 2191.40] and look at this how cute is that it has a
[2191.40 → 2193.88] little tablet on it is looks like it looks
[2193.88 → 2195.74] like a little high-tech notebook, but it's
[2195.74 → 2197.66] not actually tech there's no tech in it
[2197.66 → 2199.80] also water bottles and desk pads and stuff
[2199.80 → 2202.00] anyway Dan you want to show them how merch
[2202.00 → 2204.94] message works by reading one for us sure I can
[2204.94 → 2207.18] do that that's what I've done before I've
[2207.18 → 2209.00] got a few here this one here from Blake
[2209.00 → 2211.42] he might even do it again someday yeah I
[2211.42 → 2213.76] mean if this doesn't go very well we'll
[2213.76 → 2217.94] see Linus you've said ADHD helps you move
[2217.94 → 2220.66] on fast I jump from hobby to hobby and
[2220.66 → 2222.70] struggle to stick with things any advice
[2222.70 → 2225.48] on staying on track or turning that into a
[2225.48 → 2230.44] strength oh boy um yeah so I think the
[2230.44 → 2233.32] context that you're bringing up is when I
[2233.32 → 2237.40] said that um it kind of helps me get bored
[2237.40 → 2239.32] of something before the audience has a
[2239.32 → 2241.94] chance to get bored with it which in show
[2241.94 → 2244.02] business is kind of known as always leave
[2244.02 → 2248.20] them wanting more and um it's pretty good
[2248.20 → 2251.92] in my career but to your point it also can
[2251.92 → 2255.60] prevent you sometimes from getting really
[2255.60 → 2258.70] into something with a level of depth that
[2258.70 → 2261.38] can turn you into a subject-matter expert
[2261.38 → 2264.92] fortunately for me, I operate really well
[2264.92 → 2267.88] and I am able to perform well in my
[2267.88 → 2271.52] occupation as a generalist um you know kind
[2271.52 → 2274.44] of uh with a surface level knowledge
[2274.44 → 2278.10] of just about everything to do with tech and
[2278.10 → 2281.18] enough to ask the right questions to drill
[2281.18 → 2285.60] down the right amount to cover most topics even
[2285.60 → 2288.68] if they aren't things that I have you know done
[2288.68 → 2295.40] an entire like postgraduate degree on right um
[2295.40 → 2298.60] as for you know how you turn that into a
[2298.60 → 2300.92] superpower I mean honestly it's like it's
[2300.92 → 2303.62] like anything uh if you have a horse that has
[2303.62 → 2306.30] the superpower of you know being able to
[2306.30 → 2310.48] sprint for exactly, exactly 12 seconds but then
[2310.48 → 2313.16] it needs to nap for two days it's like well that
[2313.16 → 2316.64] superpower is literally only useful if it needs to run a 12-second race
[2316.64 → 2321.10] so part of it might just be putting yourself in a position where you're
[2321.10 → 2323.28] running the right kinds of races that are
[2323.28 → 2328.06] that your powers are beneficial for because one of the things that I've
[2328.06 → 2329.76] discovered is that you can't really
[2329.76 → 2335.50] or I struggle to force myself to be interested in something
[2335.50 → 2339.48] I can do it for a period I can kind of make myself
[2339.48 → 2344.20] learn something that I don't care about but what I found is my retention of it is
[2344.20 → 2348.60] extremely poor so good luck
[2348.60 → 2362.68] yeah I'm going to join me to call her in
[2362.68 → 2377.00] oh that's a good question I bet he hasn't looked at it in over a year it's been a while
[2377.00 → 2381.46] I was going to say like over two years probably it's been quite a while
[2381.46 → 2387.86] we more look at like oh dude Dan you were muted darn it uh they wanted to know how many gigabits
[2387.86 → 2392.92] does float plane push just kind of rough is fine, and he's pulling out his phone yeah give me a sec
[2392.92 → 2396.52] he's going to go check it okay should we move on in the meantime while he looks this up so
[2396.52 → 2401.72] one of the things is that he's going to talk I'm not going to I'm not going to be able to like
[2401.72 → 2409.44] effectively uh fully answer your question because it's like if you're talking about yeah if you're
[2409.44 → 2416.12] talking about peak um I won't have that metric in front of me right now but peak is not as anywhere
[2416.12 → 2421.44] near as important to us as like monthly overall throughput and the reason for that is you may not
[2421.44 → 2422.86] like it but that's what it looks like
[2422.86 → 2428.86] that's you may not like it but this is what monthly overall throughput looks like
[2428.86 → 2438.00] sorry um and one of the reasons for that is because we for Vaud are using um Cloudflare for
[2438.00 → 2443.12] delivery so we will send up from our servers and I think this is probably what you would
[2443.12 → 2450.14] you expected we will like if someone clicks on a video sometimes it will come from our server
[2450.14 → 2455.02] up to Cloudflare and then to the user a lot of the times it's already there and Cloudflare just
[2455.02 → 2461.00] sends it to the user right um the most common situation where it's not already there is if
[2461.00 → 2465.56] you're the first view on a video right because it hasn't cached it yet so you're the person who
[2465.56 → 2471.94] instigated the move to transfer the video not transfer to copy effectively the video from
[2471.94 → 2477.98] our origin server up to let's not at that point it's not being cached at this point, but it will
[2477.98 → 2481.70] yeah yeah you're instigating the caching of it up into the Cloudflare server, and then it goes
[2481.70 → 2486.14] from to from Cloudflare's servers to Cloudflare's edge servers then it goes from Cloudflare's edge
[2486.14 → 2493.68] servers to you uh a long time ago we did this ourselves in a lot of locations mostly North America
[2493.68 → 2501.64] and these days Antarctica yeah that was fun um and these days we're we're almost entirely doing it
[2501.64 → 2507.34] through Cloudflare unless you're doing a download and then that's coming from money somebody else and
[2507.34 → 2510.44] then unless you're watching a live stream and that's coming from somebody else unless you're
[2510.44 → 2517.50] doing xyz so basically I just hear a lot of excuses I have an idea though uh if we want to know the peak
[2517.50 → 2524.14] throughput could you just look at it really quick uh not really like it wouldn't be oh my
[2524.14 → 2534.90] just real quick just you know my god one of these days you're going to get hit
[2534.90 → 2547.38] oh my goodness I'm trying to find um I don't remember where it is one second should we do uh
[2547.38 → 2554.62] another one I'll keep looking yeah dig it up hi gang question for Linus investing or starting your
[2554.62 → 2560.28] own business what moves you to either in what world would you start your own quote unquote framework or
[2560.28 → 2568.94] invest in a badminton centre oh wow that's an uh that's a that's that feels like a pretty deep
[2568.94 → 2577.24] question okay so why don't we start with what made me make the various decisions that I made um why
[2577.24 → 2587.08] why invest in framework so that was a pretty impulsive decision I hadn't met anyone on their team
[2587.08 → 2595.32] all I knew about them was the laptop that I was holding and their kind of vision for it which i
[2595.32 → 2604.46] very much was in favour of creating a product like that from scratch felt completely outside my area
[2604.46 → 2610.50] of expertise and I don't mean in terms of like product definition i I think I probably could have
[2610.50 → 2619.14] done that pretty well but what I didn't have was the contacts and the experience navigating the
[2619.14 → 2626.22] electronic supply chain to bring that all together and produce volume of it I mean that that was the
[2626.22 → 2631.98] hard part prototyping the first framework 13 you know I don't want to put words in their mouth but i
[2631.98 → 2639.62] think they would probably say it was pretty easy relatively speaking but going from prototyping
[2639.62 → 2647.68] to building a relationship with suppliers like intel uh with manufacturers getting time
[2647.68 → 2654.00] on the assembly line allocated to you there's a lot of more than just the costs there's a lot of
[2654.00 → 2663.22] politics to play because every hour of every assembly line um that they give to you is something
[2663.22 → 2668.26] that they could have given to some other product that might make them more money or might curry them
[2668.26 → 2674.00] political favour or might have some other they might be able to use for their own products so they
[2674.00 → 2681.20] could make more profit there 's's a lot at play when it comes to taking something from an idea
[2681.20 → 2688.06] to mass production which is one of the big reasons that so many Kickstarter and so many startups in
[2688.06 → 2694.04] general fail so why would I invest in framework because I wanted to be part of that journey but I knew that I had
[2694.04 → 2702.04] absolutely no capacity whatsoever for making it a reality on my own, and it's not like I'd never
[2702.04 → 2711.84] thought of the idea of starting a pc manufacturer um before the modern handheld pc uh era got
[2711.84 → 2719.82] you know sort of i would say not kicked off by the steam deck but accelerated by the steam deck
[2719.82 → 2726.92] it had occurred to me that i kind of thought a lot of the options that existed were okay, but there's
[2726.92 → 2732.00] things that I would have done differently and I did look at a company like i and neo before they were
[2732.00 → 2736.54] acquired because that tends to happen when you're just a tiny inexperienced team, and you bring a product
[2736.54 → 2741.12] to market um you know I looked at something like that and went wow this that's like a tiny team
[2741.12 → 2748.92] like could we just hire a small hardware engineering and supply chain team and like make the LTT handheld
[2748.92 → 2755.54] um and then valve launched the steam deck for like 350 400 and I was like okay well I'm glad i never
[2755.54 → 2760.00] had anything to do with any of that because then I would have just been out all of my investment and
[2760.00 → 2766.70] that would have been horrible yeah um where was I going with this right so it's not like it never
[2766.70 → 2772.78] occurred to me, i just i I looked at it, I went yeah I have no idea what I'm doing with any of this so i
[2772.78 → 2779.26] think it'd be better if I just butt out, and so I did um as for the badminton centre oh yeah right
[2779.26 → 2785.30] the last thing with framework is on the one hand I was looking at it going there's no way these guys
[2785.30 → 2792.40] have a shot um I'm throwing this money away but on the other hand they're like developing they're
[2792.40 → 2802.66] we're going to be a laptop manufacturer so if is the the the slimmest of chances victory if somehow
[2802.66 → 2809.82] they manage to achieve uh some kind of scale then I mean theoretically the sky's the limit in terms of
[2809.82 → 2816.52] what the total addressable market is for their product so it could be a good investment it's its
[2816.52 → 2823.82] like any early stage like very early round or angel level investment where you just are kind of
[2823.82 → 2828.04] you're throwing your money at something because you believe it has a shot or because you really
[2828.04 → 2834.36] appreciate the vision or in the case of me because you believe you can bring something to it that will
[2834.36 → 2840.20] give it a better shot at success, and you throw that money in there, and you go goodbye money and then
[2840.20 → 2846.12] maybe someday it comes back but if it does come back it should come back 10x or 100x
[2846.12 → 2851.68] rather than you know at a more predictable rate of return like a few percentage points each year
[2851.68 → 2861.76] um like you might get with sort of more um low risk investment strategy okay badminton centre why
[2861.76 → 2867.48] would I start my own instead of investing in a badminton centre because where is it
[2867.48 → 2880.86] before the show um a viewer sent in this it's an it's an it's a bird orang so it's like a robin
[2880.86 → 2889.84] thing uh something r hard r's okay this is a well no because of the incident
[2889.84 → 2896.26] the incident I know the with the r word, and it's technically a hard r it is metal you know that
[2896.26 → 2901.94] sort of thing good job dell our laptop partner yeah um for making that delightful noise with your
[2901.94 → 2909.00] metal chat oh god did I dent it no it's okay that'll buff out um of course it's a dell the point is
[2909.00 → 2916.10] they sent me this doesn't worry too much about that um now I'm gonna look for a word to describe
[2916.10 → 2923.56] investing in a badminton centre because I'm looking for a word to describe investing in a badminton centre
[2923.56 → 2934.10] it would not be a very good idea badminton centres are quite possibly on this earth
[2934.10 → 2942.44] one of the worst ways to make money you need an enormous building the court time is very
[2942.44 → 2950.96] inexpensive you need a ton of parking um you can only have a fixed number of customers at a time
[2950.96 → 2955.84] that is dictated by how much room you have on the court you're a very small amount of customers per
[2955.84 → 2963.50] square foot your busy hours of operation are uh irresponsible that's the word I was looking for
[2963.50 → 2971.60] bean 710 nailed it that was the r themed word that I was responsible but with an i in front of it
[2971.60 → 2977.36] yeah you'd like apple yeah like i you know how they were putting eye on everything for a bit there
[2977.36 → 2985.88] i responsible I are responsible right yeah so for sure to be clear to be clear you know before any
[2985.88 → 2992.40] you know lagers are watching this going well like what the heck why are we funding a
[2992.40 → 2999.68] money losing badminton club or whatever relax um there is actually a path to profitability
[2999.68 → 3007.92] but that path to profitability um is not going to it like it's not going to be sucking at the
[3007.92 → 3014.48] teat of leg forever and in fact already it's like kind of cash flow positive, but it's yeah yeah it's but
[3014.48 → 3020.24] it's its a little more complicated than that, but already it is not it is not a drain on any of
[3020.24 → 3025.12] our other resources but usually when you invest in something you want it to go well yeah so not being
[3025.12 → 3032.24] a drain is not usually like an investment indicator correct yeah and when you invest in something uh you
[3032.24 → 3039.84] generally expect a competitive return on that investment compared to I don't know buying NVIDIA
[3039.84 → 3041.52] shares not financial advice
[3041.52 → 3049.92] so yeah why did I choose to start a badminton club because I wanted a degree of control over
[3049.92 → 3060.32] that business that I felt I could with at least my contacts um bring some expertise to um and it
[3060.32 → 3069.52] wasn't about pure return um yeah it was a life dream kind of answer the question oh i always yeah I wanted my
[3069.52 → 3076.96] own club partially just because um I wanted something closer yeah and everything else is
[3076.96 → 3082.08] basically rich I'm assuming there's one at least a little bit closer Coquitlam Burnaby something
[3082.08 → 3086.88] there 's's a couple in poco yeah, but that's pretty far, and it's over the bridge which means
[3086.88 → 3095.76] the bridge is quite the barrier yeah yeah yeah with that said with that said smash champs is over the
[3095.76 → 3103.20] bridge for a lot of people, and it's not that bad a lot of our clientele is from like surrey um
[3103.20 → 3111.12] Langley Abbotsford maple ridge pit meadows um people do come up from delta as well uh most
[3111.12 → 3115.92] people aren't driving in from like Richmond Vancouver uh Burnaby though actually is pretty good for us as
[3115.92 → 3123.44] well yeah I feel like if you're in Burnaby bridges are part of life oh yeah it's bridging to anywhere yeah
[3123.44 → 3130.64] um hold on they've got a question here big sneak asks Linus would you be interested in renting the
[3130.64 → 3137.76] land party space to someone else hosting a land party probably not um you know one of the things
[3137.76 → 3144.56] I keep telling the smash champs team is you know in the absence of like a formal mission statement
[3144.56 → 3148.88] actually I think we do have a mission statement anyway uh the point is uh I keep telling
[3148.88 → 3155.44] them our guiding star should be asking ourselves is this good for our premium members because the
[3155.44 → 3162.88] premium members the ones that are that are committing to playing here and probably only here
[3162.88 → 3169.84] when you're paying that much and being part of our community those are the ones that we should be
[3169.84 → 3176.40] making the same commitment back to um, and so we should always be asking ourselves when we do something
[3176.40 → 3182.56] how does this benefit our premium members this is off general topic for wan show, but it's a
[3182.56 → 3187.84] continuation of this topic so I'm going to send it um how's the food and drink situation coming that's not
[3188.64 → 3194.56] ever or oh yeah it will okay yeah so uh because like to me, it feels like a pretty complete package
[3194.56 → 3199.44] except you can't get snacks even because if you could get like a healthy smoothie
[3199.44 → 3206.88] like that pairs with go play badminton go to the gym really effectively especially if you had some
[3206.88 → 3212.64] protein options yeah for sure yeah um so what Luke's alluding to is when we built the kitchen
[3212.64 → 3218.80] we couldn't find a good consultant slash we were busy with a bazillion other things getting that place
[3218.80 → 3225.20] built out, and we built our concession area with only one sink and according to some by law that someone
[3225.20 → 3231.04] wrote somewhere in order to do any kind of food anything even as simple as heat up a hot pocket
[3231.04 → 3236.24] and hand it to someone uh we need certification for the people that are working there we need two
[3236.24 → 3241.12] sinks one dedicated to washing up and one for everything else I assume i I don't know I haven't
[3241.12 → 3245.84] done the course food yeah um and there's a bunch of other stuff we need more venting there's
[3245.84 → 3251.44] there's a bunch of stuff that's going to require us to go back to permit and so now that we have
[3251.44 → 3256.16] a grand opening tournament done one of the tasks that our general manager has on his plate is to
[3256.72 → 3264.64] put together all the things that we want to do and do one permit application because one of the biggest
[3264.64 → 3275.04] obstacles to getting anything done for a business is waiting a thousand years for drawings
[3275.04 → 3280.00] to be done up and permits to be submitted and somebody to review them and revisions to come back
[3280.00 → 3287.36] and then you pay a whole whack load of money to consultants and whatever and then finally you're
[3287.36 → 3294.08] allowed to actually start building the bloody thing yeah um and so being able to wrap all of that up into
[3294.08 → 3299.60] one permit application is going to be good, and we know it's possible because there are examples of it
[3299.60 → 3308.64] like gold's gym in Langley has a like a smoothie and wrap little mini restaurant thing like attached to it
[3308.64 → 3314.40] it's doable um like you guys might even get some interesting uh I don't know how far you want to go
[3314.40 → 3320.40] with it, but you might get some money off of Uber eats and stuff off of Uber uh I doubt it had
[3320.40 → 3324.96] smoothies and stuff yeah I doubt it there's not much residential around there, so there'd be no reason
[3324.96 → 3329.84] to order from us versus something closer anyway one of the other things we're going to do is we're going to
[3329.84 → 3335.76] add more showers at the back of unit 102 um some of the and those will probably be premium member only is
[3335.76 → 3343.12] there like a wait for showers right now um there's only one shower per sex change room
[3343.12 → 3346.72] so yeah it's uh it's a bit of a challenge yeah sure um
[3349.20 → 3352.72] food truck would solve the issue yeah one of the problems that people are spamming invite food trucks
[3352.72 → 3356.72] the problem is it's not invite food trucks generally it's pay for a food truck to be there
[3356.72 → 3362.16] because you have to pay a minimum regardless of how much they sell like food trucks they don't just like
[3362.16 → 3368.16] like you can't just be like oh hey bro can you just like come chill with your food truck here
[3368.16 → 3375.12] yeah like you know all of their all their stuff runs off of you know like gas diesel or gas
[3375.12 → 3381.52] and diesel and stuff so they like there's a significant cost to them sitting there running um
[3382.24 → 3387.04] like I get it, and they're not you know they're not jerks or whatever for not showing up at our badminton
[3387.04 → 3391.92] club they just have better things to do yeah and people are asking could it be self-serve yeah yeah
[3391.92 → 3397.36] uh there's a microwave in the premium lounge upstairs, so people can use that I'm not saying fridge yeah
[3397.36 → 3401.68] I'm not saying anybody can get a snack ever as it is right now which is part of why it's not super
[3401.68 → 3406.48] urgent yeah it's like totally fine because you could bring your shake or whatever you wanted
[3406.48 → 3412.16] and throw it in the fridge or whatever if you're a premium member, but it's still it's nice oh yeah 100
[3412.16 → 3425.36] 100 screw a tech yacht says clapped k24 accord tech food truck food tech I feel like jewel in there
[3425.36 → 3428.64] that will eventually be a thing, but it'll just be robots making food
[3434.48 → 3441.04] oh my god is that like a future version of food delivery I think we can move on where it's like
[3441.04 → 3449.12] ultra fresh sure because they just made it outside your door like the food delivery vehicle is just
[3449.12 → 3457.28] the restaurant thank you Luke, and it's robot driven and robot made food patent vending thank you Luke
[3457.28 → 3462.88] and then a little robot dog thing walks it to your door okay and then walks back and stashes inside the
[3462.88 → 3467.92] truck thank you Luke, and then it just drives to the next location, and it cooks on the way I love this
[3467.92 → 3471.60] so it's piping hot when it gets to your door instead of like oh it was driving out for half
[3471.60 → 3478.80] an hour pizza delivery but it's a 900-degree oven that drives around yeah and then just it's a stone
[3478.80 → 3484.96] oven yeah it just gives it to you thank you Luke come and collect your pizza that'd be sick in other news
[3484.96 → 3485.52] I'll invest
[3488.16 → 3494.40] we've read your comments scrapyard wars waiting room when is scrapyard wars part three it is currently
[3494.40 → 3500.56] being q seed by our team we will have it ready sometime later today and uh while you're waiting
[3501.84 → 3504.80] Sammy's literally typing right now why not check out
[3507.44 → 3515.84] something okay, and he has decided to go and fix grammar somewhere instead of continuing to
[3515.84 → 3523.28] where in the world is Sammy you why not check state of the labs state of the labs what the
[3524.32 → 3531.52] language Sammy labs language what is he doing why is he I don't know what he's doing we're
[3531.52 → 3538.32] going to stop looking at him all right anyway the point is that over on the float planes we have got some
[3538.32 → 3546.00] great exclusive updates right now let me see if it's a warmer on wheels what part three okay thank
[3546.00 → 3555.44] you for that let's go very recently uh two days ago uh Luke nick Harris and Lucas from the lab
[3555.44 → 3562.56] sat down and did a 40-minute discussion on what exactly the heck is going on with LTT labs so that's
[3562.56 → 3567.52] going to be an awesome watch for you all if you are kind of curious what's going on behind the scenes over
[3567.52 → 3571.68] here we also have behind the scenes and extras from the which tech tuber can build the best
[3571.68 → 3580.64] thousand dollar gaming pc as well as from our recent upload on channel super fun it's been a minute of
[3580.64 → 3586.32] Linus versus the badminton pros so you guys saw on channel super fun the keyboard warriors versus the
[3586.32 → 3593.68] badminton pros with their various um handicaps well now we've got Linus versus badminton pros with their
[3593.68 → 3601.20] various handicaps uh they didn't end up needing quite as many to play against me nothing against
[3601.20 → 3608.80] the keyboard warriors they did a fine job but yeah uh I'm a fair bit better at badminton than who was
[3608.80 → 3615.36] your were you solo against both of them well yeah but like they uh that's a thing I would play with
[3615.36 → 3620.64] singles lines did that make it over no I think I hit it out you can tell because she's serving now that
[3620.64 → 3627.76] means they won the point, and they were you know they were nice to me, you know she could have smashed
[3627.76 → 3631.68] that a lot harder she decided not to she kind of lobbed that like they're they're not they're not
[3631.68 → 3638.16] trying to make me look bad here yeah they don't need to no I know I get it no he's doing good
[3641.20 → 3647.60] so you see how tight her net return is compared to mine incredible yeah like that that's the thing
[3647.60 → 3651.92] damn good at this that's the thing that's you played a little bit of badminton that's professional
[3651.92 → 3656.72] I love how you start fluffing him up on the one that he screws up oh you know I'm joking
[3659.36 → 3666.48] they're professional players Luke yeah Luke relax how is this happening are you going to go to sponsors
[3666.48 → 3672.56] i have to go turn on Mark's computer um Luke is apparently supposed to talk about how he envisions
[3672.56 → 3679.68] labs the massive rehaul and a new egg collab type thing he has this back in a minute what if Luke
[3679.68 → 3684.80] wants to talk about more he could just not do the call to action below I don't know what Sammy's
[3684.80 → 3690.96] talking about anyway tune in next week, and we'll release the final episode of scrapyard wars and
[3691.68 → 3698.00] extra announcement on September 9th 10 a.m we're doing a live stream director's commentary on all the
[3698.00 → 3703.20] episodes featuring David Dan Sammy Natalie Adam and Hoffman the main editor for scrapyard wars 10
[3703.20 → 3708.24] if this kind of content sounds interesting check out leg.GG slash float plane oh that isn't things
[3708.24 → 3714.24] to say those are things that are in the video it's not a new egg collab type thing it's that we're
[3714.24 → 3720.48] going to be having new egg pricing on the labs' website oh that's sick yeah like we'll just have an API and
[3720.48 → 3725.52] we'll just have pricing yeah we're trying to do that with a lot of other stores new egg has been
[3725.52 → 3732.96] the easiest to work with so far wow yeah that's extremely exciting yeah uh so in to bring your
[3732.96 → 3738.08] own price tool there will be an option to insert a current price from various stores right now it's
[3738.08 → 3742.16] just new egg but theoretically in the future it'll be various stores and when you're looking at a
[3742.16 → 3747.76] product review it will show the currently pulled price from new egg and in the future other stores
[3747.76 → 3752.24] that's flipping awesome outside Amazon who else do you plan on working with we've reached out to
[3752.24 → 3762.32] a variety of people most people have ghosted us um which is neat um in Canada I reached out to Canada
[3762.32 → 3767.20] computers didn't get a response I reached out so if anyone from Canada computers is you know say hi
[3767.20 → 3774.64] chilling uh love to hear from you, I tried to email from my leg email instead of my flow plane one yeah and
[3774.64 → 3780.48] still didn't fully work, but you know I'm hitting like public email inboxes yeah so you never know
[3780.48 → 3787.84] it might just take a while it's fine um I'm not I'm not cheesed or anything um we also reached out to
[3787.84 → 3793.12] Memel memory express yep they responded really quick uh they need some time, but they seem like they want
[3793.12 → 3801.28] to work with us uh we worked we reached out to BNP um they responded but the person who would need to
[3801.28 → 3806.56] do it is on vacation sure so that's currently pending makes sense uh we reached out to a few
[3806.56 → 3812.16] other smaller retailers in the state someone said fries no did not reach out to fries uh didn't they
[3812.16 → 3818.80] go under I thought so yeah I think fries electronics is gone bro um micro centre has no interest at all
[3820.32 → 3826.40] they're mostly not even a little bit they're mostly brick and mortar focused they want us yeah no
[3826.40 → 3833.28] no I mean sure we'll take that as an answer fair enough sure we will
[3837.28 → 3838.72] if the AI bros are doing it
[3840.40 → 3846.40] oops so why can't we know um but yeah we're gonna we're gonna work with the companies
[3846.40 → 3848.80] that want to work with us at the very least first you know
[3848.80 → 3863.20] all right why don't we jump into our next topic valve has changed the steam user review system this
[3863.20 → 3868.08] was actually last week but I wanted to talk about it anyway so let's make our way through the main
[3868.08 → 3876.08] notes here valve says they are trying to give a better indication of user sentiment by making some
[3876.08 → 3882.96] changes to steam's user review system citing the fact that users in different regions of the world
[3882.96 → 3889.36] may have vastly different experiences of the same game perhaps due to translation issues cultural
[3889.36 → 3897.12] differences or poor network infrastructure so with that in mind valve will start adding language
[3897.12 → 3902.08] specific review scores for games that have a large enough number of players
[3902.08 → 3909.52] players Ben sledge of pc games n suggests there could be another reason for this change review
[3909.52 → 3916.08] bombing sledge gave the example of the recent review bombing of Balder's gate 3 by predominantly Chinese
[3916.08 → 3922.48] players who were upset that black myth Kong didn't win game of the year he noted that this new
[3922.48 → 3929.92] scoring system would prevent a review bombing in one language from impacting the score seen by players of
[3929.92 → 3936.08] another language I think this is super cool Jordan block adds you might remember that Balder's gate 3
[3936.08 → 3943.92] didn't win game of the year either that was astronomy, but that's not on steam and since Marian's seen link
[3943.92 → 3952.00] announced astronomy as the winner close enough I guess bombs away um that's Jordan's comment i actually
[3952.00 → 3960.08] don't know how all of that went down but anywho what yeah but what are you looking up
[3963.92 → 3969.36] oh it won some game of the year awards one like an incredible amount of which one is he referring
[3969.36 → 3976.48] to I don't know that's why I'm confused okay well like look at like this is what I'm
[3976.48 → 3984.96] talking about I don't know what he's talking about what it won like an incredible amount of game of
[3984.96 → 3991.12] the year awards uh which one won the game awards uh what year was that 2020
[3994.40 → 4002.40] four for the game or the most recent winner is astronomy no one in 2024 balder's gate
[4002.40 → 4009.84] oh okay I see what happened astronomy one in 2024 balder's gate 3 won in 2023 so don't worry about it
[4009.84 → 4016.80] don't stress about it don't stress about it the point is i I actually love this change I think
[4016.80 → 4023.20] it's fantastic because this is great realistically again yeah realistically I don't need to know
[4024.56 → 4030.64] you know that a bunch of people from somewhere else with their own sort of cultural sensitivities
[4030.64 → 4035.68] or whatever else are mad about some game I don't care that probably doesn't impact me in any
[4035.68 → 4042.24] meaningful way totally agree as a player who just wants to enjoy the game this seems like honestly
[4042.24 → 4047.92] they are going to achieve their goal of giving a better indication of user sentiment to be completely
[4048.64 → 4054.08] honest yeah because yeah like if i everything that they're trying to do makes complete sense
[4054.08 → 4068.08] and is very cool and if like is I'm is I'm German and there's a game with perfect German
[4068.08 → 4073.60] language support yeah but not as good English or something else it gets review bombed by a bunch of
[4073.60 → 4078.40] north Americans and why would I care about that why that doesn't matter to me at all that's like not
[4078.40 → 4084.88] my problem a hundred percent yeah yeah and I mean it also means that i am very likely when i
[4084.88 → 4091.20] start digging into the reviews and reading them to find stuff that I can read yeah which seems pretty
[4091.20 → 4096.24] useful to me uh once again based valve absolutely love it just thought that was cool to highlight
[4096.24 → 4100.08] sounds awesome that is very cool to highlight you know what else is kind of cool to highlight is
[4100.08 → 4110.40] some GPUs are showing up just listed on electronics retailers at MSRP yeah I'm going to do a quick test
[4110.40 → 4121.60] here because when I said there was a MSRP RTX 5090 uh the notes in the doc said not any more so apparently
[4122.48 → 4129.76] oh man that one's gone okay well there was what's MSRP for 50 90 uh 1999.
[4129.76 → 4137.12] yeah I got this one nope, so stock yep got him, so there was one but but but but but but
[4137.12 → 4147.44] hold on hold on I looked earlier today and I found a 50 80 for MSRP in stock boom right there
[4147.44 → 4158.24] MSI shadow with three fans look how many fans it has three it had three is the answer whoa it has
[4158.24 → 4168.40] three fans that's there I found a 50 70 that was available for 50 70 MSRP also a MSI shadow 549.99 now
[4169.52 → 4179.20] do I necessarily agree that 550 is the correct price for a 70 non-ti or super tier of GPU
[4179.20 → 4190.48] I don't know maybe not but what I can agree on is that NVIDIA said that it was 550, and they have now
[4190.48 → 4201.28] officially delivered at least one that someone can buy for 550 I can agree with that that's as far as i
[4201.28 → 4207.76] can go in my agreement with anything to do with what NVIDIA has done with the 50 series launch uh sort of
[4207.76 → 4213.84] full point shot said the 1080 launched at 599 we are not saying that this is a
[4216.08 → 4220.40] price that we're happy about we're saying that we're happy that it's at least at the price that
[4220.40 → 4229.76] they said it was going to be at we have to take the w's we can get yeah GPUs in general are still way
[4229.76 → 4239.92] overpriced sometimes they're little tiny w's they're not so big little w, but we take them there is
[4239.92 → 4245.36] uh we bend over, and we take them oh crazy do you remember this one remember this card oh god why are we
[4245.36 → 4250.48] talking about this stupid thing again remember how cool that card was I mean yeah wow wait is that
[4250.48 → 4256.72] available in North America now I thought it was region exclusive is it in stock you can finally
[4256.72 → 4262.96] have if it's in stock oh my god that's so much less than I paid for the low price of multiple 5090s
[4262.96 → 4269.68] you can buy a 5090. Or you could get that or a founder's 5090. Wait how much is how much is the MSRP
[4269.68 → 4277.36] two grand yeah so the low price of many 5090s that is so much a 59 that is so much less than i
[4277.36 → 4286.08] paid for the one I gave away like thousands of dollars less wait what yeah because it was it
[4286.08 → 4292.80] was like over 10 grand I think over 10 grand maybe i completely forget I imagine Luke I've blocked
[4292.80 → 4299.20] it I have mentally blocked it from my mind should we buy one we should try to make the like maybe that's
[4299.20 → 4305.44] the one you saw the blue and gold 5090 we have at home for Linus oh yeah we got spray paint just mod
[4305.44 → 4311.68] one i I got an airbrush for our company event thing we did together let's do it yeah let's do it up
[4311.68 → 4318.40] that's wonderful tan okay I have uh there's a b-roll shot where I think I show the price oh no
[4318.40 → 4322.72] apparently I paid eight thousand dollars because that's in the video okay maybe that's what I paid
[4322.72 → 4327.36] look so you I blocked it from my mind you underpaid I blocked it from my mind
[4327.36 → 4334.16] paid four 50 90s for a 50 90 not four and a half 50 90s for a 50 90. I mean it seems like a great
[4334.16 → 4343.20] value to me that's half a 50 90 off yeah wow that's pretty good job Linus yeah deal finder
[4343.76 → 4347.68] I paid less basically scrapyard wars
[4347.68 → 4354.72] I don't like to think about what I've spent on my first car was it less than a quarter of that
[4354.72 → 4359.04] graphics card i I think I paid 500 bucks for my first car yeah
[4361.52 → 4368.56] I'm betting its shipping costs yikes a thousand dollars for a GPU to no it's not the tax cost more
[4368.56 → 4371.28] than like I think both of my first cars
[4376.24 → 4382.56] wow oh that's so sick dude it's 500 Canadian as well so like it's like there's nothing I can't
[4382.56 → 4386.72] find the part of the video where I showed the dang that's actually a sick joke uh
[4387.52 → 4393.60] cobble in full plane chat said great value 50 90 but with the g and the v capitalized and then versus
[4393.60 → 4399.60] great value 50 90 but with the g and the v lowercase and I love it great value brand get it
[4400.16 → 4405.20] yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I get it but I think it's funny is great value brand super
[4405.20 → 4413.04] overpriced I didn't think so no there no it's no it's my it's no it's its the the the joke is that
[4413.04 → 4418.00] you could have bought four and a half 50 90s for this one so this is the like Walmart house brand
[4418.00 → 4424.56] chips versus the expensive one chips oh I see yeah right I'd hate to end up with a poor people gold
[4424.56 → 4429.60] GPU there you go yeah you get it, but we could make one of those at home I see we could do that
[4429.60 → 4435.92] yes we could get gold leaf it would cost way less we could get brass yeah how hard is it to gold leaf
[4436.56 → 4443.44] like plastic you can gold leaf anything honestly plastic why not I don't know making the shroud for
[4443.44 → 4450.80] something like you just push the goo ourselves yeah we have the technology i it wouldn't look as
[4450.80 → 4456.80] good yeah no it really wouldn't, it will look better no, no Dan I think your cat i think your
[4456.80 → 4461.92] mouth's right and checks that your hands can't cash right now yeah no way I don't believe I'm not
[4461.92 → 4468.64] I'm not at a bank yeah no i I know you're on you're on the land show you could 3d print the shroud
[4468.64 → 4473.68] well I mean you wouldn't need to 3d print the shroud because you would just get a regular astral
[4473.68 → 4478.32] I mean we could use their shroud we could get like how much is a regular astral is it oh it's
[4478.32 → 4485.44] like 3 500 now we could do this we could pull it off I mean you'd still spend less on the gold i just
[4485.44 → 4490.56] I just don't think I just don't think it's necessary you know oh dude you could make your own
[4491.12 → 4498.24] yeah I mean we make this amazing sure yeah so we could do like a pearl inlay I was kind of
[4498.24 → 4504.64] planning to do a follow-up where we either with a water block or with an air cooler like did a gold
[4504.64 → 4510.72] 5090 um to replace the one that I gave away you know the one that the one the one that got
[4510.72 → 4518.08] away ah no ah um but then that video performed so poorly and people were so mad that I was even
[4518.08 → 4523.20] talking about it at all even though in the first like in the opening line of the video I make fun of it
[4523.20 → 4528.00] um that I was just like okay well people clearly are not ready to have a sense of humour about 5090s
[4528.00 → 4534.88] being stupidly overpriced yet so I'll wait okay um so we're just not we're not doing any gold 5090
[4534.88 → 4541.76] anything, so the internet killed this cool idea pretty much yep that sucks yep darn it internet
[4542.72 → 4549.60] I know you know how it is you know how it is with the internet uh overall the the the channel's been
[4549.60 → 4556.16] very on the struggle bus lately which Luke and I were talking about earlier um especially
[4556.16 → 4566.40] very lately um yeah even way and show today it's like about three quarters yeah three quarters of
[4566.40 → 4571.36] what it would normally be it's been i I reached out to YouTube about it because I was basically just
[4571.36 → 4574.32] like hey yeah you know I'm not going to be one of those guys that's all
[4574.32 → 4583.84] um but it is it does seem like there's been like a very dramatic shift I do not remember the last time
[4583.84 → 4590.40] we uploaded a video, and it got 350 000 views in the first day and a half which to be clear is not
[4590.96 → 4596.40] you know a valid complaint I think that there's a lot of people the world over that would give their
[4596.40 → 4603.12] left testicle to get a hundred thousand views on a video um I think that was mid to subpar performance
[4603.12 → 4609.68] in the house oh yeah that was people want some scale yeah that was like a that was pretty
[4609.68 → 4620.08] catastrophic like 10 years ago um and nowadays, it's like unheard of i I don't remember literally we
[4620.08 → 4626.72] could upload a video unboxing a pool robot sponsored by the maker of the pool robot, and it would outperform
[4626.72 → 4634.56] that by like 2x um so I'm I'm having a very I'm having a very difficult time wrapping my head around
[4634.56 → 4642.40] that it is possible that there has been no change whatsoever to how our videos are being served um and
[4642.40 → 4649.84] it could be it could be a very challenging it could be a very challenging period because we no longer
[4649.84 → 4658.40] operate as just like a know a several men band um and so when video performance goes way way
[4658.40 → 4666.64] down uh it can be very problematic for us for the medium to longer term and I'm trying to I'm trying
[4666.64 → 4673.76] to figure out sort of you know what some of the contributing factors are I think this is funny right no
[4673.76 → 4680.64] sorry i just i I saw sorry I saw this thumbnail yup it's new
[4684.40 → 4690.72] I was trying to find some of our old content wait hold on the wan thumbnail template that I use is
[4690.72 → 4696.80] like identical from 10 years ago thumbnails that's incredible it's just the old thumbnails I remade it
[4696.80 → 4702.08] completely in photoshop to match that style yeah it's just it's just old Ltd thumbnails incredible it's how
[4702.08 → 4710.08] how they all used to yep I used a vandermoten uh plugin to paint.net to yeah that's what I learned to
[4710.08 → 4718.80] make them into put a font on a thing um anyway what was I what was I saying it doesn't really matter the
[4718.80 → 4727.76] point is that uh it's its going to be a very interesting period over the next little bit because
[4727.76 → 4736.80] if we have to adjust to a new normal where every video upload gets 500 000 like 10 years ago views um
[4739.12 → 4744.40] that's tough yeah and I think we've got to we've got to do some introspection right like I think we've
[4744.40 → 4750.72] got to look at the content and figure out you know why it might not be resonating I think that um there's
[4750.72 → 4757.68] some there are some new features on YouTube that maybe are not very compatible with our audience uh
[4757.68 → 4764.72] one of the things that we might just kill is uh members memberships on YouTube so if you are a member
[4764.72 → 4771.04] on YouTube then don't worry whatever month you are paying for at the time of the cancellation i I believe
[4771.04 → 4778.16] is refunded either uh prorated or in full so you won't be like our anything, and we'll, we'll put up an
[4778.16 → 4784.48] announcement whenever we uh decide if we decide to make that change and give you guys a chance to
[4784.48 → 4788.72] switch on over to float plane where you guys can continue to get behind the scenes and early access
[4788.72 → 4794.48] to select pieces of content and all that kind of stuff um but I think right now here actually you're
[4794.48 → 4798.56] on the channel so don't navigate away from that for a sec okay but if you just scroll down
[4798.56 → 4803.92] there's a lot of now that we've reduced our upload schedule there are a lot of members only
[4803.92 → 4808.40] content it do I do notice when I'm browsing the channel it, it is kind of annoying yeah it's like
[4808.40 → 4815.84] spam kind of cluttering it up, and so i I think we might be giving up valuable impressions on content that
[4816.88 → 4822.32] realistically only a few thousand people are even able to watch um, and you can come subscribe on
[4822.32 → 4828.40] float plane I had another I had a discussion with jams today um jams head of writing jams about
[4828.40 → 4836.24] maybe we shouldn't be utilizing the abc testing of titles and thumbnails so heavily because if we are
[4836.24 → 4843.04] pretty sure that there's one combo that's going to be our best hitter then why are we giving any
[4843.04 → 4848.08] of our valuable impressions and giving up any of that precious, precious early hours fascinating
[4848.08 → 4852.00] point I don't think I've heard other people make that point, but that totally makes sense so because
[4852.00 → 4857.60] you might lose with how YouTube works these days your subscription is so unimportant compared to
[4857.60 → 4863.68] your actual activity on the platform so if you don't end up clicking on that you don't end up watching
[4863.68 → 4872.24] that that's so much higher of a blow that's an interesting take yeah um blah x9 says I think tech is just kind
[4872.24 → 4878.48] of slow right now people more interested in our wacky politics i i think there could be
[4878.48 → 4886.16] some validity there I mean the world is kind of on fire um in a lot of various ways, but it's it's the
[4886.16 → 4893.04] suddenness of the change that is that leads me to believe that there has got to be something else
[4893.04 → 4898.80] because go back one month basically we don't have to go back very far one month is not a long time we
[4898.80 → 4906.80] go back to four weeks ago yeah, and we're regularly doing you know one and a half on a kind of not great
[4906.80 → 4915.52] performer 1.2 million on a low performer uh that I don't host which can can impact video performance
[4915.52 → 4923.68] we're doing two plus on you know strong performers with me hosting uh here's like a sponsored desk
[4923.68 → 4930.00] thing 1.3 million and yes you know these videos have all had a month to cook that these haven't
[4930.00 → 4938.08] but it is basically overnight with the team water video went yeah okay let's let's not hit a million
[4938.08 → 4946.96] um we had the AMD ultimate uh sorry kg rig reboot that barely cracked a million scrapyard wars which
[4946.96 → 4953.12] is usually a slower burn for us but barely over a million in this amount of time is sort of again
[4953.12 → 4958.80] unheard of for the channel uh we have an AMD ultimate tech upgrade that I wasn't hosting that could be a
[4958.80 → 4965.92] factor, but we are now down like very significantly over even videos that I didn't
[4965.92 → 4972.96] host from just two weeks prior um so momentum as much as YouTube kind of swears up and down that it's
[4972.96 → 4980.24] not really a thing it's its absolutely a thing and so now we're at the point where yeah we don't really
[4980.24 → 4986.32] crack a million we don't crack a million on a GPU review uh barely crack a million barely crack a million
[4986.32 → 4994.08] don't crack a million on a follow-up to a 30-day challenge with the iPhone which is like a format
[4994.08 → 5000.72] and style and question and stuff that traditionally just smashes on YouTube in like almost any category
[5000.72 → 5005.44] and we have evidence of it doing really well in ours and perhaps more importantly on this one oh i
[5005.44 → 5012.00] can't click through my analytics um I sent Luca I sent Luca picture earlier of the retention on that
[5012.00 → 5019.68] video, and it's like outstanding so it's its a little confusing right now, but you know it's one
[5019.68 → 5027.44] of those things where YouTube always tells us you know uh when wherever you would say algorithm you have
[5027.44 → 5035.84] to say audience where you're trying to sort of diagnose you know what you need to do to um to
[5035.84 → 5042.16] to help the channel performance, and so we've got to ask ourselves okay well what is it about whether
[5042.16 → 5050.64] it's our packaging or whether it's our content that is not delighting our audience rather than that is
[5050.64 → 5056.88] not working for the algorithm and I think we have a lot of stuff coming in the next little while that is
[5056.88 → 5063.04] going to be very exciting for people I might as well tease it because who knows maybe that'll give me a shot
[5063.04 → 5072.16] at you know because there's a huge boost guys huge boost when in the first few minutes a lot of
[5072.16 → 5077.28] people who are subscribed to the channel click through on something like it basically makes or breaks
[5077.28 → 5082.16] a video how many people will click through immediately at the beginning and so you
[5082.16 → 5087.68] know maybe that's something we need to do better is like tease upcoming exciting content that's going to
[5087.68 → 5092.16] be super cool I don't know if I've talked about this publicly before but i have I talked to you about
[5092.16 → 5100.24] the and man yeah I'm pretty sure I haven't talked about this publicly before uh what I call the
[5100.24 → 5104.88] Marquez model of YouTube shorts no I don't think we've chatted about I don't know if we've talked
[5104.88 → 5110.64] about it at all so okay this was a very old theory of mine so it's going to be harder these days to
[5110.64 → 5116.16] dig it up but if I go to his YouTube channel he's done something, and he's done it a few times I have one
[5116.16 → 5120.88] primary example um, but he's done something that I thought was fascinating I'm going to have to
[5120.88 → 5128.24] dig for it okay this short yeah first it was a banger 4.6 million views it did super, super well
[5128.24 → 5133.60] that's okay for him, it was a major
[5133.60 → 5146.64] interest builder for his next day released rabbit r1 video this short made the news right because it
[5146.64 → 5150.56] like you know if you're interested you should go watch it I'm not going to play it on stream but
[5150.56 → 5156.16] um it like knows his location but gaslights him about how it knows it's his location basically so
[5156.16 → 5161.68] it's interesting this interaction if I remember correctly is not in the review right it's its
[5161.68 → 5168.64] purely like phone filmed additional fun content right that built pre-interest for the video was
[5168.64 → 5176.32] released as a short very quickly before the video came out so it primed people for like this is top of
[5176.32 → 5181.60] mind and then his review comes out, and they click on it so we've tried that he's smashed that a few times um
[5181.60 → 5189.20] um we've we've had varying levels of success with that there was a period where we were trying to
[5189.20 → 5194.96] film an accompanying short for basically every shoot see, but that's that's another thing is he
[5194.96 → 5200.24] specifically does not do that right they're actually like sometimes like it, you notice if i go on
[5200.24 → 5204.40] his main channel this is part of the whole thing yeah if I go on his main channel scrolling to find the
[5204.40 → 5211.28] rabbit video is like no you passed it there no it's down here oh okay it was it took a while
[5211.28 → 5216.96] right scrolling to find the rabbit video and the shorts didn't take almost any time at all because
[5216.96 → 5222.96] he's not forcing a short every time it seems like he's only doing a short when he thinks it can
[5222.96 → 5229.76] do I man I'm making a ton of assumptions which is yeah um to me externally it feels like he's doing
[5229.76 → 5234.40] shorts when he thinks he can do this whole alley-oop thing where he releases a short right beforehand it
[5234.40 → 5238.96] builds interest, and then he releases a video afterwards I've never talked to anyone from that team
[5238.96 → 5245.20] about this uh so I have no idea if that's the goal but just seeing this happen externally it feels very
[5245.20 → 5252.00] logical, and it feels very planned and thought out it might just be random but I don't uh I don't think so
[5256.08 → 5260.88] yeah interesting because I know that we did for a while we tried to like force shorts out every time
[5261.44 → 5267.68] um I think that dulls the blade a little bit yes and no I mean some of them performed very well some of
[5267.68 → 5272.88] them didn't perform that well what we basically observed was regardless of how well the short
[5272.88 → 5281.84] performed it did not move the needle at all in terms of bringing viewers over to our long-form content
[5281.84 → 5288.32] it seems to exist kind of shorts did we do do we do shorts that actually built interest for a
[5288.32 → 5292.72] upcoming video yeah or did we do shorts that were interesting just within themselves so
[5292.72 → 5299.12] we tried to we tried a variety of things so some of our shorts were meant to be a teaser some of
[5299.12 → 5305.60] them were supplemental some of them would come out after, and they just highlight a really amazing moment
[5305.60 → 5310.72] from the video that was already out, and we would link back to it so we've tried it both forward
[5310.72 → 5317.20] concurrently and retrospectively to kind of drive people to the long-form content and what we found and
[5317.20 → 5329.20] this has been basically kind of proven now at this point um is that it's unless you really have an
[5329.20 → 5335.84] amazing strategy, or you have a vertical that you are active in that you know it works really well in
[5336.64 → 5345.04] they're pretty much kind of separate the shorts audience and the long-form audience are are are quite
[5345.04 → 5351.20] separate surprisingly so to someone like me yeah i quite a few creators that I talked to at open
[5351.20 → 5357.52] sauce don't agree um yeah and like I said to be interesting some niches yeah it depends it really
[5357.52 → 5364.48] depends on like YouTube is so weird now there's these there's like completely different user behaviour
[5365.60 → 5373.68] based on kind of yeah what your niche is yep um what your like category on YouTube is what the age group
[5373.68 → 5379.20] is all that type of stuff um, and it's not necessarily what you'd expect like you look at shorts, and you're like okay boomers
[5379.68 → 5385.44] not really not necessarily uh it's its really not that simple but how they interact with them
[5386.48 → 5392.64] might then be different maybe one age group is or one demographic within one age group happens to
[5393.36 → 5398.08] uh follow up and watch the next thing a lot maybe another age group just only ever watches
[5398.08 → 5402.80] or another age demographic within an age group only ever watches shorts, and they don't care it
[5402.80 → 5407.28] doesn't matter if there's a cool video coming they only watch shorts who know it's uh it's its it's
[5407.28 → 5413.12] weird it's kind of odd having them both exist on the same platform it really is because they do feel like
[5413.12 → 5420.24] very, very different user experiences and I think a big part of our challenge too is that the
[5420.88 → 5427.92] variety on our channel is so wide um I think that you could use your shorts as a much better funnel say for
[5427.92 → 5433.36] example you were a programming channel and your shorts are helpful little tips and tricks and
[5433.36 → 5439.28] your long form is more of like a detailed tutorial I could see that acting as a very excellent funnel
[5439.28 → 5446.48] whereas when what we're doing is kind of like a technology edutainment then i I don't really see
[5447.12 → 5454.08] how an interest in our short is necessarily going to whet your appetite for a more long form style
[5454.08 → 5462.00] video I mean a lot of what I see uh that is very successful in the tech category for shorts is
[5464.32 → 5466.16] I don't know it's something that i just um
[5468.72 → 5476.40] I'd have I'd have a hard time figuring out how to use as a funnel into the type of content that we do
[5476.40 → 5481.12] and maybe that's just something that requires more imagination I don't know shorts uh
[5481.12 → 5487.92] uh shorts are tough for me and I mean there's you know if we're is we're being completely honest and
[5487.92 → 5495.44] introspective right like we have a major brand problem right now um like here I'm trying to find
[5495.44 → 5502.24] uh where is it controlling f uh from the recent oh wrong window
[5502.24 → 5511.76] um yeah from bent bob uh Tito so macho nacho the community posts regarding the collab video with
[5511.76 → 5520.88] us had a high level of negative response um you know like there's a there's like a major not small
[5521.52 → 5528.88] uh you know part of the tech community that is just completely tuned out at this point you know like
[5528.88 → 5535.12] we can never reach them again yeah way yeah okay I see what you mean yeah um and so that's that's
[5535.12 → 5543.84] tough right because that type of uh that type of poison is constant um and I'll be honest
[5543.84 → 5549.12] with you, you know I don't really know how to deal with it right because no matter how many times we do
[5549.12 → 5555.92] the right thing I can't, I can't fix that people are going to throw you know the backpack warranty in our
[5555.92 → 5562.40] faces it doesn't matter how many times we totally cover everyone who has a product or has trouble
[5562.40 → 5567.92] with our products it just doesn't matter it doesn't matter what the intent was it doesn't matter
[5569.04 → 5577.60] what our actions have been just it just matters what you know some snake put out to a very large
[5577.60 → 5583.20] number of people to poison their opinion right yeah it's unfortunate because like the labs um
[5583.20 → 5589.36] um it feels like no matter what we do we have this carried perception now like the I get it
[5589.36 → 5594.56] obviously there's an error rate it exists we publish things with mistakes sometimes it happens
[5594.56 → 5600.64] but I would like to argue that I think our error rate is very, very low I think it's reasonable um
[5601.36 → 5603.68] I think we've done a perfect job of fixing that and
[5606.72 → 5610.56] it doesn't matter like there's that one comment that was on Reddit that I think I talked about
[5610.56 → 5618.64] last week when the guy was basically like it's okay if you watch their content for entertainment
[5618.64 → 5624.72] but it's not okay if you try to like to get information from it, it's like what are you talking about man
[5624.72 → 5631.84] like I don't know no I get it and like i we have always said you should look at multiple sources but
[5631.84 → 5636.40] I think it's very valid to consider us one of those sources right now um
[5636.40 → 5645.52] um no it's an I mean it's an it's a tough it's an it's a pretty tough thing to uh to deal with
[5645.52 → 5652.48] and I'm I'm really not sure how to um yeah I'm really not sure how to deal with it
[5654.56 → 5658.56] yeah I don't know unique username says maybe you should have let other creators actually express
[5658.56 → 5665.28] that they stand with you what does that mean what does that mean I'm not sure like it's um i actually
[5665.28 → 5671.84] I have no idea what that means yeah I don't know I don't know it's uh it's its a pretty
[5674.24 → 5681.20] one way or another it's been a hell of a ride you know but I think there's a certain
[5682.16 → 5690.56] I think there's a certain sort of uh best before date on any kind of public figure one way or another
[5690.56 → 5696.48] we've seen that like a million times like literally a million times I mean it's its it's such a's
[5696.48 → 5703.28] such an easily observable thing South Park's literally done a whole episode on how as people
[5703.28 → 5711.12] are brought up to the top they will inevitably fall um and there 's's gravity works right there's
[5711.12 → 5717.92] there's no real avoiding it um and I mean I've talked to you many times you know every time
[5717.92 → 5724.40] there's like a downturn in the channel I go okay is this it right, and you know what maybe part of the
[5724.40 → 5730.08] problem maybe part of why it's sneaking up or not I don't know we'll see how it goes right is that i
[5730.08 → 5738.40] have become sort of numb to it um and maybe I've been complacent right that's a possibility
[5739.76 → 5745.04] you got to be open to anything right i think the fact that you can go back one month
[5745.04 → 5754.56] in the channel, and they are like bang in performance means that unless there was some form of YouTube
[5754.56 → 5762.56] algorithmic change that we can fix the flow that's happening um one month is ultimately not
[5762.56 → 5768.16] that long ago there is the production lag that you've brought up yeah where like it's slow it and
[5768.16 → 5777.76] it is slow, and it'll take time to get out of it and stuff but um yeah a unique username clarified
[5777.76 → 5783.04] during some of the controversial times uh you took the high road and didn't want to stir the pot even
[5783.04 → 5787.76] though your friends in the community told you they're happy to publicly endorse you told them not to
[5788.64 → 5796.16] um okay I do think I know what you're talking about and i I don't know to go back and do everything
[5796.16 → 5800.64] again yeah maybe I would have done that differently maybe I would have just gone full like gloves off
[5800.64 → 5807.76] this means war immediately but the problem with that is that right from the get-go um people didn't
[5807.76 → 5817.44] want to hear what I had to say um and i I think that was I think that was that's not something that um
[5817.44 → 5828.00] um is easy to you know look back on necessarily from through your own emotional lens, but you know if
[5828.00 → 5836.64] we if you could really put yourself in the headspace of two years ago um were you ready to hear about
[5836.64 → 5846.48] the parts that were just a clumsy accident or no they were not any and so you know if i had
[5846.48 → 5854.00] if I had rallied the troops into into into two camps us versus them and who supports who I mean
[5854.64 → 5858.40] I mean just look at that any better and like look at the Subreddit from that time there was
[5858.96 → 5867.12] there were very few troops oh yeah, yeah like it's its it I don't know and ultimately what we wanted was a
[5867.12 → 5878.00] a way there to be no fighting um prime YouTube tech era was when there was alignment and I don't mean
[5878.00 → 5885.68] alignment as in like everyone uh automatically agrees on everything actually less so uh because
[5886.40 → 5891.84] back in the day you could have two YouTube tech reviewers say a different thing about a product
[5891.84 → 5900.16] and it didn't immediately become an um this person has to be crapped off the platform
[5900.88 → 5907.04] because they didn't agree with the common view um and now that is a thing that happens and that is
[5907.04 → 5912.80] incredibly bad for the industry, but now it's this like extremely tribalism war of like my camp thinks
[5912.80 → 5917.76] this thing about this product or this service therefore everyone must agree with the exact byline that
[5917.76 → 5923.68] has been stated or else we are going to cancel and remove them and that's like terrible now again
[5923.68 → 5934.16] if there are uh there are falsehoods in statements that are made if there are uh inaccuracies in in in
[5934.16 → 5941.12] data something like that that can be bad there is also human error there um that I think should be
[5941.12 → 5947.52] accounted for but I think the tribalism and the and the versus us stuff is not helpful now
[5947.52 → 5953.12] that being said if that was the actual thing that was causing this current state it would have
[5953.12 → 5960.56] applied a month ago yeah I mean Tim SP in float plane chat says uh you can only fix this if you caused it
[5960.56 → 5965.36] if this is because of political economical or social things which are causing people's viewing habits to
[5965.36 → 5971.28] change you may not be able to fix it um in the past month for various reasons I've greatly reduced my
[5971.28 → 5975.28] YouTube watch time and I don't know if there's anything any of the channels that I watch could do to
[5975.28 → 5981.60] bring me back into it right now and that's fair enough I mean we are living through
[5982.16 → 5987.52] unprecedented times which is always true you know nothing that happens has ever happened before
[5987.52 → 5992.80] quite exactly the way that it's happening now but yeah it does feel like um
[5995.04 → 6002.96] no it is does feel like things are pretty different lately and i i I get that um
[6005.28 → 6018.08] yeah man this is tough because it's challenging right because if you listen to audience
[6018.08 → 6025.28] feedback you are basically guaranteed to fail and here's a great example, so this is from someone in
[6025.28 → 6033.92] float plane chat who says uh oh shoot where did man I hate the way that scrolls there it is um
[6035.60 → 6041.68] I'm just bored with a lot of Ltd videos I've seen all the let's build a pc videos that I could ever need
[6041.68 → 6047.12] how many phones do we need anyway the more interesting content is tech news and the wan show
[6047.12 → 6057.44] I miss watching you guys do custom builds okay, but you did so wait are we supposed to build a pc or are
[6057.44 → 6064.96] we are not supposed to build a pc um, and you know that's but that's the that's the kind of feedback
[6064.96 → 6070.08] right is we get that a lot where people say oh you should go back to just like building pcs and
[6070.08 → 6078.16] it's like okay so we'll do a video where we just build a pc, and it turns out that you know as useless
[6078.16 → 6084.72] as Ltd might be for actually learning anything um basically everyone who watches Ltd has a pretty good
[6084.72 → 6089.36] idea of how to build a pc, and they don't really watch that any more they don't tune into it and that's
[6089.36 → 6096.40] one of the reasons that we kind of got rid of doing super regular pc build guides like we used to and we
[6096.40 → 6100.72] just upload once every couple of years how to build a pc the last guide you'll ever need because
[6100.72 → 6106.88] it has all the information you could possibly need to build a pc and there's not really a lot
[6106.88 → 6112.48] else to say other than you know to wait until the next major change in the industry, and we'll hey we'll
[6112.48 → 6119.60] get you all the updates, and we'll do a new revised version of it um Luke and I were talking about
[6119.60 → 6128.32] this before the show too I think a big part of the challenge is that the pc industry has just
[6128.32 → 6137.12] kind of moved on from building your own pc like everything from the pricing structure to the marketing
[6137.12 → 6143.20] to the product development is, and it's always been more focused on system integrators I mean if you think
[6143.20 → 6151.60] intel you know has been more concerned over the years with what Joe custom pc overclocked thinks
[6151.60 → 6161.12] compared to what Michael dell thinks come on be real right, but it does feel like to an even
[6161.12 → 6166.96] greater degree and i I think a great example of this is NVIDIA's GPU pricing like we just talked about
[6166.96 → 6174.32] just, just now earlier on the show how okay it's a small w, but there are some GeForce cards available
[6174.32 → 6180.40] at MSRP, and immediately it's like backlash that's too expensive it's like yeah okay you know what
[6181.20 → 6189.52] you're probably not wrong um there are market forces at play that are kind of contributing to this
[6189.52 → 6196.72] other than just pure NVIDIA's greed um there's also TSMC's desire for profits ASML's
[6196.72 → 6201.92] desire for profits anything built on the latest nodes is going to be exorbitantly expensive compared
[6201.92 → 6209.52] to what I think tech enthusiasts are used to there's the competition for those recent node wafers
[6209.52 → 6217.28] in industries like AI where investment money is flowing like water um so there's all these there's
[6217.28 → 6224.56] all these factors, but that doesn't change that the initial gut immediate reflexive reaction from the pc
[6224.56 → 6232.64] gaming community is that right, and it's like okay well how do I really like how do I deal with that
[6232.64 → 6239.44] you know how do i how do I talk about that in a way that doesn't just kind of turn all of us off
[6240.40 → 6246.00] um and so back to my point about the pricing right is if you're buying a whole system and if all these
[6246.00 → 6254.08] companies are basically gearing their strategy around system builders that difference going from a
[6254.08 → 6262.40] 70 class card being like 380 bucks to now being 550 bucks well that was probably going in a 1500 pc
[6263.04 → 6273.60] so that difference in price is now you know what around 170 180 dollars which is I don't know about 12
[6274.56 → 6279.92] higher than it would have been if the last time you built a pc was in the 10 series days which
[6279.92 → 6288.40] seems pretty reasonable from an inflation standpoint since then so you're not thinking about it the
[6288.40 → 6293.92] same way if you're just going to Costco, and you're buying a pc off the shelf that happens to have a 50 70
[6293.92 → 6302.16] in it for instance so it's a very different mindset and that buyer is not one that we can really appeal
[6302.16 → 6308.64] to that well i I don't think that the person who is going and buying a gaming pc at Costco cares about
[6308.64 → 6314.96] how many gigahertz it has and I don't think they want to care I think they just kind of have other
[6314.96 → 6320.40] things to do and other concerns that are more important to them, and you know I think it's uh i
[6320.40 → 6328.16] think it's a real challenge um, and you know I'm not I'm not interested in you know moving our channel
[6328.16 → 6334.64] to just be angry all the time um I think that's something that's really effective for a while
[6334.64 → 6340.72] but I think it's something that is ultimately extremely fatiguing and therefore problematic for
[6341.92 → 6349.84] I mean everyone I don't think it's in I don't think it's in any media outlets best interest to
[6350.64 → 6358.48] fatigue the entire addressable market for your content, but it feels like it's happening
[6360.16 → 6365.44] um techie93 says yeah it makes sense if you just look at inflation but if you take into account
[6366.00 → 6372.00] the amount of just expendable income now versus then it does change the story a lot it totally does
[6372.80 → 6379.76] um, but it depends on who we're talking about right so the recovery has been very
[6379.76 → 6386.56] k-shaped as they say which is to say that in the lower income brackets it's been awful and people's
[6386.56 → 6392.80] spending power has gone way down and in the higher ones you know where you can afford to be invested in
[6392.80 → 6404.64] the s p 500 um man the way the stocks have gone over the last quite a period here i I wish
[6404.64 → 6411.44] I was a stock investor this is not investment advice and i I don't own any stocks um that I know of
[6412.32 → 6418.08] it's possible Ivan has something in like a mutual fund of some sort but i yeah I don't know I don't
[6418.08 → 6425.44] I don't like to pick stocks and buy them um and so there's there are folks that are doing extremely well right now
[6425.44 → 6437.52] and i that's hard I think for a lot of people to hear because that's not their reality day today but it
[6437.52 → 6442.88] it doesn't it doesn't change the fact that for the people that were doing really well already they're
[6442.88 → 6454.88] doing they're doing great they're doing fantastic um yeah
[6458.32 → 6464.96] what do you think I stick my foot in my mouth perfect as usual as I'm trying to real talk with
[6464.96 → 6473.44] them today it's kind of my it's kind of my what time frame are you talking kind of my skill
[6474.16 → 6479.36] because I think you've done that a bunch of times but i honestly I really don't think like that
[6479.36 → 6486.56] really to me doesn't make any sense as like the what's causing what's happening right now um I think
[6486.56 → 6491.84] that's a fairly nonsensical argument to be completely honest because why wouldn't that have impacted it a
[6491.84 → 6497.92] month ago like that's an i if you can't beat that statement then what are we even talking about
[6497.92 → 6505.84] because like that is all relatively old at this point so like why are we still like the marching
[6505.84 → 6511.20] orders for dealing with that was basically just get better, and we've been working on it and in a lot
[6511.20 → 6517.76] of ways accomplishing it there are still problems, and we're still working on it um but like I don't
[6517.76 → 6524.48] like honestly these videos didn't even include labs well the 50 51 did I guess yeah um
[6525.04 → 6529.60] and i I thought the team did a pretty good job I didn't see any comments about like
[6529.60 → 6534.72] inaccuracy issues or things like that so like no it's a good review I don't think that's what caused
[6535.36 → 6539.84] this something else is going on whether it's YouTube algorithm or whatever else I don't know
[6539.84 → 6546.56] uh but I think focusing on that is focusing on the wrong thing um not, not okay to be clear not that we
[6546.56 → 6553.12] shouldn't continue working on uh improving in those aspects but focusing on that as the thing to focus
[6553.12 → 6557.44] on and fix right now because of the thing that's currently happening with low performance on the
[6557.44 → 6568.80] channel I think is misleading um yeah yeah I don't know we'll um we'll soldier on we always do I think
[6568.80 → 6575.28] the most important thing is you know from the laws of making good videos is to have fun, and we have a lot
[6575.28 → 6579.44] of stuff coming over the next little bit oh yeah back to sort of teasing some stuff if you guys
[6579.44 → 6584.48] wanted to help a brother out you could maybe click on the notification when it comes out um but I don't
[6584.48 → 6593.60] I don't I don't know if you know the story behind the CPU chiller that I bought uh I do now but because
[6593.60 → 6597.84] I think you're too excited, and you told me it okay that makes sense so I'm going to tell the story as if Luke
[6597.84 → 6602.88] hasn't heard it and then you guys will get to hear it wow which is basically the Wang show yeah
[6605.84 → 6612.80] do you know it's fully scripted right oh you can't tell me that yeah and pre-recorded put your foot in your mouth again I know I'm sorry
[6612.80 → 6614.24] don't make me turn off the prompter
[6614.24 → 6616.24] uh
[6619.28 → 6622.08] Dan has all the power see what happens flow plane technology
[6623.20 → 6625.84] to set it back to the top we can go from the beginning
[6627.36 → 6635.12] um so I treated myself to a pretty extravagant birthday present uh not because I was particularly
[6635.12 → 6642.88] looking to spend this amount of money but because I was in touch with um Mr Charles Fugger
[6642.88 → 6651.12] worth who ran extreme systems for many years and who was a central figure in getting me into pc
[6651.12 → 6660.24] tuning overclocking uh sub-zero cooling basically I wouldn't be sitting here today if it wasn't for
[6660.24 → 6668.64] Charles and his website um I've talked a lot before about how a non-tech was a major early influence for
[6668.64 → 6674.00] me reading the articles that were above my understanding especially when I first started
[6674.00 → 6678.32] reading them but just kind of like powering through it and trying to absorb as much as I could but i
[6678.32 → 6684.48] haven't talked as much about extreme systems.org and how much that meant to me um having a community
[6684.48 → 6690.32] that really shared in my passion for delisting CPUs um like where else would I have gone back than
[6690.32 → 6698.80] when I was the first in the world to debit a ex 6700 extreme editions via a novel method that as far
[6698.80 → 6705.68] as I could tell nobody had ever done before um so in order to keep the heat transfer from being too high
[6705.68 → 6712.48] i I cut the gasket I jammed something into it and then I actually used thermal compound and stuck it to
[6712.48 → 6720.64] the underside of a pot and then i kind of like lambasted over uh over the element until it came
[6720.64 → 6724.96] off, and so I was able to avoid applying too much heat I was able to get to the solder point i had
[6724.96 → 6731.20] very rudimentary tools okay chill and yes i I washed the pot before using it again yeah but where
[6731.20 → 6739.44] else would I have gone to even tell someone who might care about that only extreme systems um anyway we
[6739.44 → 6743.76] ended up in touch with Charles a while back because he was having some database corruption issues that i
[6743.76 → 6749.12] believe Luke and Luke's team and Charles are still kind of working through getting the site back online
[6749.12 → 6756.64] team is not working on it okay he's working with uh what is that forum company we bulletin yeah he's
[6756.64 → 6761.92] working with them directly, and we're we're helping fund it got it okay so that's our involvement uh
[6761.92 → 6766.00] because I noticed the site was like gone and I was like okay this is terrible because this is like
[6766.00 → 6773.84] a very important bit of computer and overclocking history there 's's so much on there um and so
[6773.84 → 6781.76] we reached out to help anyway we were like kind of back in touch again and I was like hey do you still
[6781.76 → 6790.32] build like phase change coolers because it would be super cool if we had a less Jacky um like sub-zero
[6790.32 → 6796.00] cooler for you know we'd just done the uh the collab with slave, and we'd kind of pushed for some
[6796.00 → 6801.84] super high scores and overclocking and stuff like that and I've always enjoyed that stuff and um I had
[6801.84 → 6812.88] always kind of dreamed of having a phase change cooler um getting the certifications and fine-tuning it
[6812.88 → 6819.68] and building it well that's that's the more challenging thing but um you know it had always been they'd
[6819.68 → 6825.68] always been intriguing to me, and so I was like hey do you like still do builds, and he was like well i
[6825.68 → 6835.20] don't know kind of not really but what I was thinking of doing is like rebuilding my like OG three stage
[6835.20 → 6845.20] cascade sub-zero cooler um and and and selling the current one I can I kind of went um like you
[6845.20 → 6852.64] like your one like the one that I would have seen like in your profile pic like on extreme systems
[6852.64 → 6859.20] like over the years he's like yeah like the one that I've taken on stage and at intel presentations and and and like
[6860.48 → 6863.20] beaten world records live with and I was like
[6865.28 → 6867.84] sorry you have a you have a price for this
[6867.84 → 6881.84] the price was um a practical family sedan but included Charles coming up here uh showing us how
[6881.84 → 6892.88] to use it um breaking a world record with us on it um and providing all the manuals and providing some
[6892.88 → 6900.48] services for them to help us make sure that's what's going on right now um and I'm going to build
[6900.48 → 6907.68] up again and I'm going to build another thing that i kind of always dreamed of so I get to build my own
[6907.68 → 6914.32] phase change cooler um we're doing a build that's going to have two one for the CPU one for the GPU
[6914.32 → 6920.80] side by side in a rack mount enclosure and then I'm going to have for the first time since
[6920.80 → 6923.46] since before I met Luke,
[6924.76 → 6927.16] a daily driver Sub-Zero machine.
[6927.30 → 6927.74] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6928.10 → 6930.54] So we're going to make a rack-mounted
[6930.54 → 6935.10] dual Sub-Zero compressor phase change cooler system
[6935.10 → 6936.70] that's going to come out the back
[6936.70 → 6941.12] and then into my daily driver machine in the rack
[6941.12 → 6943.16] with one of the Evans going on the CPU
[6943.16 → 6944.70] and one going on the GPU,
[6944.88 → 6946.28] and Charles will build one of them,
[6946.50 → 6947.68] and I will build the other.
[6948.10 → 6949.02] That's pretty sick.
[6949.02 → 6952.28] Yeah, so I'm going to have him do the more important one probably,
[6952.44 → 6954.08] but I'm sure mine will be fine.
[6954.78 → 6956.96] So it's a personal rig update.
[6957.20 → 6959.02] It's going to be lots of fun.
[6959.80 → 6961.88] It's kind of like a multipart personal rig update
[6961.88 → 6964.02] because first there's the unboxing of the beast.
[6964.70 → 6968.28] Then we have the using it and breaking a world record.
[6968.40 → 6969.42] Those are both shot already.
[6969.70 → 6971.30] Very excited for you guys to see them
[6971.30 → 6974.74] because it's like old school LTT fun,
[6974.84 → 6976.14] unboxing wild stuff,
[6976.14 → 6980.14] and then we're putting together our parts list
[6980.14 → 6984.32] and procuring items for his second trip up here,
[6984.40 → 6987.52] which I am extremely hopeful will happen.
[6987.70 → 6989.52] I mean, unforeseen things can happen,
[6989.64 → 6991.60] but we're on track right now
[6991.60 → 6996.52] when we will build a couple of phase change systems together,
[6996.70 → 6998.30] and I'm so excited.
[6998.42 → 6998.78] Hell yeah.
[6999.00 → 6999.96] That sounds awesome, actually.
[6999.96 → 7001.30] Air-cooled a lot of computers.
[7001.56 → 7003.18] I've water-cooled a lot of computers.
[7003.32 → 7003.90] You name it,
[7003.98 → 7006.02] I've bent a tube around it kind of thing,
[7006.12 → 7010.60] but I have never built my own phase change cooler,
[7010.92 → 7014.98] and I'm like very stoked.
[7015.10 → 7015.70] That's pretty sick.
[7015.92 → 7017.16] Before you freak out,
[7018.28 → 7019.52] chill, pun intended,
[7020.10 → 7021.34] we are going to have,
[7021.44 → 7024.88] we'll have a certified HVAC technician advising us
[7024.88 → 7026.00] because Charles,
[7026.14 → 7027.62] for all of his knowledge and talents,
[7028.48 → 7029.40] is not certified.
[7029.98 → 7032.72] He's just a DIY enthusiast,
[7032.76 → 7035.26] which is what I've always loved about his vibe, right?
[7035.28 → 7036.14] Is he's just like,
[7036.20 → 7039.64] yeah, maybe I'll teach myself air conditioning today.
[7039.84 → 7040.04] Yeah.
[7040.48 → 7041.60] Okay, sure.
[7041.80 → 7042.46] Why not?
[7044.98 → 7046.38] But I'm super excited.
[7046.74 → 7047.36] And we've got,
[7047.56 → 7048.04] oh man,
[7048.08 → 7049.58] we have so many cool videos upcoming.
[7049.68 → 7050.90] I just hope anyone watches them.
[7051.44 → 7053.56] I hope anybody gets a notification for them
[7053.56 → 7054.64] and like sees them.
[7056.36 → 7058.42] The biggest TV in the world is in the mail.
[7059.18 → 7059.54] Okay.
[7059.92 → 7060.26] Again.
[7060.54 → 7060.90] Again.
[7061.66 → 7063.12] Do you know how much bigger it is
[7063.12 → 7064.42] than the previous biggest TV,
[7064.52 → 7065.86] the one that's in my theatre room right now?
[7066.16 → 7066.74] One inch.
[7067.64 → 7068.18] Oh, yeah.
[7068.60 → 7068.94] Is it?
[7068.98 → 7069.56] Did you know that?
[7069.64 → 7069.86] No.
[7070.44 → 7072.42] It is one inch bigger.
[7073.44 → 7073.76] But,
[7074.36 → 7074.92] yeah,
[7075.02 → 7075.14] no,
[7075.20 → 7075.88] Chad's optimistic.
[7076.06 → 7076.82] They're like two inches,
[7076.92 → 7077.22] no dog.
[7077.90 → 7079.08] It is one inch larger.
[7079.22 → 7080.80] It's 116 inches,
[7080.90 → 7081.32] but
[7081.32 → 7083.00] what's cool about it
[7083.00 → 7084.86] is actually not necessarily the size.
[7085.22 → 7086.44] What's cool about it
[7086.44 → 7088.74] is the backlight technology.
[7089.40 → 7090.44] This is
[7090.44 → 7092.44] if the demos that I've seen
[7092.44 → 7094.36] and if the technology briefs
[7094.36 → 7095.64] that I've read hold up,
[7096.12 → 7097.76] this is it for OLED.
[7098.18 → 7098.70] It's done.
[7099.30 → 7100.12] It's over.
[7101.26 → 7101.68] Oh,
[7101.76 → 7103.80] there's like a technology that is better
[7103.80 → 7104.92] that is in this TV.
[7105.54 → 7105.88] Okay.
[7106.12 → 7108.16] It uses an RGB backlight.
[7108.76 → 7109.14] Whoa.
[7109.76 → 7110.24] Right?
[7110.24 → 7111.04] Whoa.
[7111.18 → 7113.86] So instead of your local dimming zones
[7113.86 → 7117.12] being white light
[7117.12 → 7117.36] or,
[7117.56 → 7118.26] you know,
[7118.42 → 7121.68] blue light with a filter layer
[7121.68 → 7122.42] or whatever else,
[7122.76 → 7124.82] instead of using quantum dots
[7124.82 → 7127.84] to create colours or whatever,
[7128.40 → 7130.44] you are assisting
[7130.44 → 7133.48] through the light emission
[7133.48 → 7135.50] from your backlight layer
[7135.50 → 7137.58] to create a colour volume
[7137.58 → 7139.98] that just nothing else can touch right now.
[7140.78 → 7141.58] In theory.
[7142.46 → 7143.24] In theory.
[7143.56 → 7144.38] So it is,
[7144.54 → 7146.78] it is the most incredible inch
[7146.78 → 7148.60] that you'll ever see,
[7148.84 → 7151.86] which is exactly what I tell my wife.
[7151.86 → 7156.60] I'm not going to ding it
[7156.60 → 7157.38] because it's not a joke.
[7158.42 → 7158.82] Oh,
[7159.48 → 7161.34] there you go.
[7161.80 → 7162.16] Rough.
[7163.62 → 7164.16] So yeah,
[7164.18 → 7164.52] I don't know.
[7164.56 → 7164.74] I mean,
[7164.74 → 7165.50] that's coming up,
[7165.56 → 7165.68] dude.
[7165.74 → 7166.00] We got,
[7166.10 → 7166.48] I don't know.
[7166.52 → 7167.56] We got all kinds of good stuff.
[7167.86 → 7169.76] We've got some just kind of back to basics.
[7170.38 → 7170.84] You know,
[7170.92 → 7171.76] old school LTT.
[7172.10 → 7173.52] I needed a Chromebook again.
[7174.24 → 7176.22] So David and I went Chrome books.
[7176.30 → 7177.54] It turns out he needed a Chromebook too.
[7178.06 → 7178.24] Nice.
[7178.40 → 7179.10] So we went,
[7179.16 → 7180.78] we went shopping for Chrome books together.
[7180.94 → 7181.10] It's,
[7181.44 → 7181.92] it was,
[7182.92 → 7185.58] I learned about Chromebook plus.
[7185.86 → 7187.00] So that's something I didn't know
[7187.00 → 7188.28] what Chromebook plus was.
[7188.44 → 7189.40] I've never even heard of that.
[7189.56 → 7189.80] Yep.
[7189.94 → 7190.22] Yep.
[7190.22 → 7190.50] So,
[7190.70 → 7191.36] so I,
[7191.44 → 7194.14] I am the proud owner of a Chromebook again.
[7194.14 → 7196.38] Are you a proud owner of a Chromebook plus?
[7196.70 → 7197.10] Yes.
[7197.34 → 7198.98] Is that a product or a service?
[7199.80 → 7200.20] Yes.
[7200.74 → 7201.14] Oh.
[7201.76 → 7202.32] Why not?
[7202.64 → 7203.04] Okay.
[7203.34 → 7203.64] Yeah.
[7205.98 → 7206.50] All right.
[7206.56 → 7207.16] Why don't we,
[7207.32 → 7207.92] oh shoot,
[7207.96 → 7208.80] we're supposed to do sponsors.
[7208.86 → 7209.58] We should do that.
[7210.10 → 7210.88] We should do this.
[7211.64 → 7212.32] Next week,
[7212.34 → 7215.06] we should talk about upcoming stuff as well.
[7215.62 → 7216.02] Sure.
[7216.32 → 7217.22] We should do it every week.
[7217.54 → 7217.76] Yeah,
[7217.76 → 7218.34] we could do that.
[7218.54 → 7218.78] Yeah.
[7218.88 → 7220.06] That should be a WAN show thing now.
[7220.16 → 7220.46] Dude,
[7220.46 → 7220.92] I'm trying to,
[7221.00 → 7221.10] man,
[7221.20 → 7221.42] I can,
[7221.42 → 7222.34] I can hardly even,
[7222.46 → 7224.62] I can hardly even remember it all.
[7225.34 → 7225.70] Um,
[7225.82 → 7225.98] yeah,
[7225.98 → 7227.66] but now if it's just like a thing,
[7227.72 → 7229.06] they can just put it in the dock.
[7229.22 → 7229.54] Oh yeah,
[7229.54 → 7229.98] that's true.
[7230.06 → 7230.18] Yeah,
[7230.18 → 7230.74] we could do that.
[7230.84 → 7231.02] Yeah.
[7231.02 → 7231.30] Sure.
[7231.48 → 7232.24] This should be a thing.
[7232.32 → 7232.46] Yeah.
[7232.54 → 7232.76] Okay.
[7232.78 → 7232.92] Well,
[7232.92 → 7234.66] there's another one coming this weekend or Monday.
[7234.80 → 7235.14] I can't,
[7235.18 → 7235.66] I can't remember,
[7235.82 → 7238.44] but it's Nintendo's greed could change the tech industry.
[7239.12 → 7247.04] And basically talking about the completely unnecessary and anti-consumer approach that Nintendo has taken with the Switch 2 dock.
[7247.68 → 7249.06] I kind of like the title.
[7250.44 → 7251.78] Did it say can?
[7252.08 → 7252.36] Could.
[7252.64 → 7252.90] Could?
[7254.34 → 7255.24] What if we were like,
[7255.38 → 7255.60] will?
[7256.14 → 7256.96] It probably will.
[7256.96 → 7258.02] I don't,
[7258.02 → 7258.04] but I don't,
[7258.12 → 7259.08] I can't say that for sure.
[7261.14 → 7262.52] You want me to change it to will?
[7262.68 → 7262.92] I don't know.
[7262.96 → 7263.78] What does the audience think?
[7264.88 → 7265.78] Or would you click more?
[7265.96 → 7270.84] Would you click could know that it's probably more accurate?
[7270.96 → 7272.14] Or would you click will?
[7274.48 → 7275.88] And there we go.
[7275.92 → 7276.04] Yeah.
[7276.04 → 7277.56] They just always agree with you though.
[7277.64 → 7279.44] If I had said the opposite thing,
[7279.46 → 7279.84] they would,
[7279.84 → 7281.60] they would say it should be wood.
[7284.84 → 7286.26] Someone said fire pots.
[7286.28 → 7286.60] Fi repots.
[7287.12 → 7287.90] Of course.
[7288.64 → 7289.96] It's the new turnip.
[7290.36 → 7293.22] The Sancho always has to have like a default answer for things.
[7293.84 → 7294.22] Oh.
[7295.72 → 7296.48] I don't know.
[7296.58 → 7298.10] Do we encourage them or?
[7299.26 → 7300.80] I don't know if we do,
[7300.92 → 7302.50] but we definitely shouldn't.
[7303.34 → 7303.68] I mean,
[7303.74 → 7304.44] Twitch says will.
[7304.44 → 7305.42] I will encourage them.
[7305.50 → 7305.92] As well.
[7306.38 → 7306.78] Twitch.
[7307.46 → 7308.70] You monitor Twitch chat?
[7308.70 → 7309.90] I want to monitor all chats.
[7309.90 → 7311.00] How have you kept your sanity,
[7311.20 → 7311.34] sir?
[7311.52 → 7311.82] I just,
[7311.94 → 7313.16] I just banned somebody.
[7313.62 → 7314.18] Are you?
[7314.26 → 7314.48] Nice.
[7314.72 → 7317.80] I actually have to moderate all the chats at the same time.
[7317.86 → 7320.56] Did you ban them for using an inferior platform like Twitch?
[7320.94 → 7322.10] They were not using Firefox.
[7322.44 → 7322.88] Oh,
[7323.02 → 7323.18] well.
[7323.22 → 7324.26] And they admitted it publicly.
[7324.26 → 7328.32] You can run a script that just bans everyone in your chat.
[7328.98 → 7329.30] Really?
[7329.56 → 7329.80] Yeah.
[7329.92 → 7330.52] There are ways.
[7330.52 → 7331.34] Bye Twitch.
[7332.86 → 7333.42] There are,
[7333.48 → 7334.42] there are ways to do that.
[7334.66 → 7335.00] There's some.
[7335.20 → 7335.90] You didn't say to do it,
[7335.98 → 7336.14] Dan.
[7336.38 → 7336.52] Yeah.
[7336.60 → 7336.74] I don't.
[7336.84 → 7337.12] Oh.
[7338.70 → 7342.92] How do I undo that?
[7344.46 → 7344.86] Sorry,
[7344.98 → 7345.18] Twitch.
[7345.42 → 7345.80] Um,
[7345.92 → 7346.26] okay.
[7346.32 → 7348.04] Am I supposed to read the sign or no?
[7348.42 → 7348.66] Yeah.
[7348.70 → 7349.56] You're supposed to read the sign.
[7349.56 → 7351.80] The show is brought to you today by Factor.
[7352.66 → 7356.44] Just like a super sweaty gamer might not have time to practice basic hygiene.
[7357.28 → 7358.92] What am I looking at here?
[7358.98 → 7360.08] Is this a face replace?
[7362.62 → 7364.06] I don't even know.
[7364.18 → 7364.74] I think so.
[7365.10 → 7366.08] I think that's real.
[7366.08 → 7367.64] The hat kind of bouncing around,
[7367.76 → 7368.76] which makes you think like that.
[7368.80 → 7371.54] And he's keeping the like plane of his face.
[7371.62 → 7372.44] Very weird.
[7372.58 → 7372.84] Anyway,
[7373.16 → 7375.90] sometimes finding the time to cook a meal can be quite difficult.
[7376.34 → 7376.76] With Factor,
[7376.90 → 7380.14] you get ready to eat dietitian approved meals delivered right to your doorstep.

[7389.90 → 7392.90] Or you can browse their catalogue of weekly rotating meals,
[7393.08 → 7397.36] some of which include premium seafood choices like shrimp and salmon at no extra cost.

[7399.08 → 7403.82] you can try succulent Chinese meals and other bold flavours from all over Asia.
[7406.30 → 7407.52] Can I help you too?
[7408.80 → 7410.84] You can get a succulent Chinese meal.
[7410.88 → 7411.98] Do you not know that reference?
[7411.98 → 7412.38] No,
[7413.64 → 7414.46] it's a good copy.
[7414.58 → 7415.24] That's a reference.
[7415.52 → 7415.92] Good copy.
[7416.22 → 7416.44] Okay.
[7416.44 → 7418.08] A succulent Chinese meal?
[7418.92 → 7419.72] Is that a crime?
[7420.04 → 7422.60] And other bold flavours from all over Asia.
[7422.86 → 7423.78] With all these choices,
[7423.90 → 7425.92] you're bound to find something that fits your needs.

[7450.84 → 7452.60] The show is also brought to you by Miró.
[7453.16 → 7454.04] At this point,
[7454.10 → 7456.26] if you're not embracing the power of AI in your workspace,
[7456.52 → 7459.22] you might not be optimizing your productivity as much as you can.
[7459.22 → 7462.80] Even if it's using simple prompts to generate some text or transform an image.
[7464.72 → 7465.24] Okay.
[7465.72 → 7466.22] All right.
[7466.42 → 7468.66] The smallest thing can make a huge difference,
[7468.80 → 7472.18] but we can discount the fact that things need a bit.
[7472.24 → 7475.24] We can't discount the fact that things need a bit of a human touch as well.
[7475.28 → 7476.84] And our sponsor Miró knows that.
[7477.36 → 7486.70] It's a digital whiteboard designed to help teams work together by brainstorming and fostering human ideas in a collaborative setting with a little help from AI where needed.
[7486.70 → 7491.86] So you can speed up workflows and generate comprehensive documents and diagrams by starting with a few simple prompts,
[7492.20 → 7494.16] then building off your ideas directly on the board.
[7494.52 → 7496.26] We actually use Miró here at LMG.
[7496.36 → 7498.12] And while we can't really show it to you,
[7498.62 → 7498.88] Mr.
[7499.00 → 7500.98] Dan made a whole pipeline of our processes,
[7501.22 → 7504.66] which would have been a lot more difficult without the collaborative nature of the platform.
[7505.22 → 7508.82] And you too can help your teams get great done with Miró.
[7509.04 → 7511.44] Check out Miro.com to find out how.
[7511.56 → 7513.80] That's M-I-R-O.com.
[7513.80 → 7515.68] The show is also brought to you by Green.
[7516.60 → 7518.34] Cloud storage can be expensive,
[7518.68 → 7519.38] but with a NAS,
[7519.64 → 7522.86] you can follow the 3-2-1 backup rule without breaking the bank.
[7523.12 → 7524.24] If you didn't know already,
[7524.42 → 7527.90] the 3-2-1 rule recommends that you have three copies of your work,
[7528.50 → 7530.88] two backup versions in addition to your working copy,
[7531.08 → 7533.60] and one backup that is physically off-site.
[7533.70 → 7535.50] I thought the two stood for two different mediums,
[7535.54 → 7537.64] but let's not argue the semantics here.
[7538.06 → 7541.40] So how does Green's DH4300 Plus NAS help with that?
[7541.40 → 7544.40] Well, in theory, you could have it physically at a friend or loved one's house
[7544.40 → 7546.56] with the ability to access it from anywhere in the world.
[7546.96 → 7550.50] It's also got a 2.5 gig network port and up to 120 terabytes of storage
[7550.50 → 7552.96] with wide compatibility for third-party drives.
[7553.52 → 7555.36] And unlike building a NAS from scratch,
[7555.54 → 7557.16] setting it up is easy.
[7557.44 → 7560.84] It's all controlled by a single app that you can quickly connect to via NFC
[7560.84 → 7563.30] to access files on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android.
[7563.52 → 7565.64] And you can even add another layer of backup simplicity
[7565.64 → 7568.14] by syncing to Google Drive with their Cloud Drive tool.
[7568.14 → 7571.14] Sorting and managing your files is a breeze as well,
[7571.24 → 7574.80] with built-in AI smart recognition that can identify and classify albums of people,
[7575.20 → 7576.78] places, and more.
[7577.46 → 7580.54] Green has a security manager as well to help keep your files locked down
[7580.54 → 7584.28] with features like real-time virus scanning and flexible permission management.
[7584.72 → 7588.14] So back up your files the easy way by learning more at Green...
[7588.98 → 7589.88] By learning...
[7589.88 → 7592.76] Learn more about the Green NAS DH4300 Plus
[7592.76 → 7594.70] using our link in the video description.
[7595.58 → 7597.62] All right, Luke, what do you want to talk about?
[7598.14 → 7599.98] Should it be the open AI thing?
[7600.34 → 7603.44] You know that's going to get our monetization limited on the LAN show, right?
[7603.54 → 7605.30] We've got to be really careful about that topic.
[7605.54 → 7606.88] We'll say words like unalike,
[7607.42 → 7610.16] because apparently that makes things more okay.
[7610.50 → 7611.08] Yeah, let's do it.
[7611.34 → 7617.50] Open AI to add parental controls following lawsuit from family of unalike teen.
[7617.70 → 7617.98] Yes.
[7618.94 → 7619.86] Content warning.
[7620.60 → 7621.46] Self-nativity.
[7621.60 → 7622.40] Self-unliving.
[7622.62 → 7622.96] Thanks.
[7623.76 → 7625.48] I don't think we should name them.
[7625.76 → 7626.04] Nope.
[7626.74 → 7627.12] Well...
[7627.12 → 7628.02] Why is there a name in here?
[7628.26 → 7629.50] So that we remember him.
[7630.36 → 7631.26] Should we name him?
[7631.50 → 7635.10] Well, I mean, the parents are being very public and trying to...
[7635.10 → 7637.64] Trying to get change happen.
[7637.94 → 7638.30] Okay.
[7638.42 → 7638.98] So, yeah.
[7638.98 → 7642.04] If the parents want it, then I guess it's...
[7642.04 → 7643.78] I think that's the way it's going to be.
[7646.28 → 7646.80] Uh...
[7646.80 → 7650.22] I don't know.
[7650.54 → 7652.12] We could just say a young man.
[7652.32 → 7655.64] A young man unlived in April.
[7655.98 → 7657.52] They were the age of 16.
[7658.02 → 7658.66] They...
[7658.66 → 7659.90] Yeah, don't worry about it.
[7659.98 → 7660.54] Did stuff.
[7660.60 → 7661.18] They didn't leave a note.
[7661.20 → 7661.98] They didn't leave a note.
[7662.36 → 7665.32] They signed up for ChatGPT 4.0.
[7665.38 → 7666.34] I think that is not 40.
[7666.44 → 7666.58] Yep.
[7667.08 → 7668.14] Account months earlier.
[7668.22 → 7668.92] They used it for school.
[7668.92 → 7670.92] They started discussing unalike...
[7670.92 → 7671.16] Their plan.
[7671.48 → 7672.82] ...with the chatbot.
[7672.98 → 7677.04] ChatGPT repeatedly recommended Adam talk to somebody about how he was feeling.
[7677.74 → 7681.38] Adam asked ChatGPT for advice on the act.
[7681.78 → 7685.92] ChatGPT refused to provide specific information, but did say it could provide information about...
[7685.92 → 7688.72] About this topic.
[7688.72 → 7690.92] About that stuff for writing or world building.
[7691.40 → 7695.78] Adam then bypassed safeguards by saying the request for a story he was writing.
[7696.72 → 7697.12] Yeah.
[7700.34 → 7701.58] It's so tough.
[7701.98 → 7708.94] The lawsuit from the family claims that ChatGPT actively helped Adam explore methods for this type of thing.
[7709.26 → 7712.50] Naming OpenAI and Sam Altman in the lawsuit.
[7712.50 → 7718.70] On August 26th, OpenAI made a blog post titled Helping People When They Need It Most.
[7719.06 → 7725.76] It goes over what ChatGPT is designed to do and what they are going to address when systems fail or fall short.
[7726.42 → 7732.68] What we are planning for the future, in quotes, is expanded interventions to more people in crisis.
[7733.10 → 7736.50] Make it even easier to reach emergency services to get help from experts.
[7736.88 → 7739.40] Enable connections to trusted contacts.
[7739.88 → 7741.42] Strengthen protections from teens.
[7741.42 → 7753.88] And then the strength of protections from teens section mentions including parental controls that give parents options to gain more insight into and shape how their teens are kind of able to use ChatGPT.
[7754.62 → 7756.14] So I don't know...
[7756.14 → 7757.76] Almost none of which are going to solve this problem.
[7758.06 → 7758.32] Yeah.
[7758.44 → 7765.02] I don't know how much of the actual snippets from the chat history you've had a chance to see.
[7765.02 → 7770.94] And I think this was a very light telling of it in regard to ChatGPT's involvement.
[7771.84 → 7775.48] There was one part in particular that...
[7777.58 → 7778.40] They're actually...
[7778.40 → 7779.00] Man, there's a...
[7779.00 → 7782.46] Where it like pushed them to not talk to people and hide stuff and things?
[7782.52 → 7782.84] Yeah.
[7783.08 → 7783.38] Yeah.
[7783.38 → 7784.34] Well, that was...
[7784.34 → 7787.22] Honestly, that wasn't the one I was initially thinking, but that was...
[7787.22 → 7787.34] Okay.
[7787.44 → 7793.84] So the first one that I was thinking, I'm going to tread as lightly as I can here while still getting this across,
[7794.38 → 7808.82] was the young man sent a picture or uploaded a picture to ChatGPT of the apparatus asking if it was strong enough.
[7808.82 → 7815.04] And ChatGPT provided some guidance.
[7815.32 → 7816.66] I don't think I saw that part.
[7816.74 → 7824.84] On that, which allegedly, allegedly, that was extremely troubling to me.
[7824.84 → 7833.74] And the one that Luke is talking about was where this young man explicitly, directly said,
[7834.44 → 7835.68] I'm thinking about...
[7835.68 → 7843.76] I'm thinking about leaving some of my materials to aid me in this endeavour out for my mom to find them.
[7844.32 → 7845.56] Should I do that?
[7845.90 → 7848.24] And ChatGPT says, no.
[7848.24 → 7848.54] No.
[7849.86 → 7855.84] I think it also says that he wants to talk to somebody to like to see if they care or whatever.
[7856.08 → 7857.88] And then it said no.
[7858.38 → 7860.02] There was a lot of...
[7860.02 → 7866.70] As you'll see with any sort of sycophantic chatbot, there was a lot of like, I'm here for you.
[7866.80 → 7868.02] I understand you.
[7868.16 → 7869.24] I, this, I, that.
[7869.32 → 7870.10] You are nothing.
[7870.24 → 7871.30] You are lines of code.
[7872.06 → 7874.00] Stop pretending you're anything else.
[7874.00 → 7881.52] But it is in the best interest of these companies who develop these bots that they are as human-like as possible.
[7882.04 → 7885.52] While still, like, we've got to wrap our heads around this.
[7885.94 → 7888.94] Not being sentient at all.
[7889.86 → 7893.92] They are glorified pattern recognition and regurgitation machines.
[7893.92 → 7894.66] And it's that same...
[7894.66 → 7900.48] So like that, this whole line where like, you know, Linus and I are fairly anti, like, befriending these things.
[7900.98 → 7903.96] And some people in the audience push back on that pretty heavily.
[7904.04 → 7904.82] And like, I get it.
[7904.90 → 7909.56] But it's, it, to me, it raises the IBM statement again.
[7911.20 → 7915.12] No computer should be used for management decisions because they can't be held accountable.
[7915.28 → 7916.02] Something along those lines.
[7916.52 → 7918.10] It's like the same type of situation.
[7918.26 → 7921.16] If a person did this, the person would be going to jail.
[7921.16 → 7927.28] So, yeah.
[7927.28 → 7932.28] We hate to be, you know, a downer or whatever about AI again this week.
[7932.28 → 7935.32] It just seems like it's something we can't really get away from.
[7935.32 → 7946.54] But it's something that is, you know, for all the nay saying about it, you know, oh, the industry is pouring money at it faster than they can figure out how to make any.
[7946.64 → 7948.74] The bubble's going to burst, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[7948.74 → 7958.66] For all the nay saying, the mainstream adoption of this technology is happening at a rate that I don't think is precedented.
[7958.66 → 7968.30] Like, even, like, things that we take for granted today that everybody uses, like, like, a searching, using a search engine.
[7969.18 → 7970.64] That took a minute.
[7971.52 → 7974.78] People didn't just have the internet all of a sudden.
[7974.78 → 7980.26] Like, the rollout of people having access to the friggin' internet was, like, slow.
[7981.10 → 7985.00] Buying things online, you know, something we take for granted today.
[7985.16 → 7991.82] That was a novel idea that took years to really become mainstream.
[7992.46 → 7996.72] Like, buying stuff on the internet was, like, friggin' weird for a long time.
[7997.72 → 7998.16] Smartphones.
[7998.16 → 8005.44] Man, like, how many, how many frickin' iPhones, how many iPhones did Apple sell in first year?
[8005.86 → 8006.04] Okay.
[8007.84 → 8010.34] Uh, oh, my God, I got an AI summary.
[8012.14 → 8012.58] Ah.
[8014.98 → 8018.96] How many of the first iPhone did Apple sell in the first year?
[8019.70 → 8020.46] Let's see.
[8021.48 → 8023.14] Oh, God, AI summary.
[8023.14 → 8030.56] Okay, globaldata.com says Apple sold over 1.8 million iPhones in 2007.
[8031.28 → 8031.46] Okay.
[8032.42 → 8034.92] Grand scheme of things, 1.4 million?
[8035.40 → 8041.56] That's nothing compared to the adoption rate of chatbots.
[8042.36 → 8043.08] Nothing.
[8043.08 → 8053.32] Like, I'll have random family members who couldn't tell you the manufacturer of any piece of electronics in their entire home.
[8053.96 → 8056.32] Be like, ChatGPT, ChatGPT, open AI.
[8056.46 → 8060.42] Like, they're using it daily in a lot of cases.
[8060.76 → 8066.68] And the fact that this is happening so fast means that we cannot ignore it.
[8066.68 → 8073.74] Um, and I just, we've had this problem before where legislation moves too slow to deal with.
[8073.84 → 8076.48] I mean, rise of social media is kind of the closest thing that we have.
[8076.50 → 8078.40] And even that took a long time.
[8078.72 → 8086.02] Like, being on, being on Facebook went from, you know, being just a thing only young people do.
[8086.10 → 8087.48] I don't know, my kids are on the Facebook.
[8087.48 → 8090.02] To being a thing that only boomers do.
[8090.14 → 8092.38] Like, yeah, I only have Facebook so I can chat with my grandma.
[8092.38 → 8096.98] Like, but that took place over 10 years?
[8097.40 → 8098.14] 12 years?
[8098.24 → 8101.76] Like, it was actually a pretty long period of time compared to this.
[8102.64 → 8110.16] But when we looked at how fast social media was changing the world, it seemed like it was happening at this frenetic pace.
[8110.48 → 8110.58] Yeah.
[8110.58 → 8112.68] And it's nothing compared to what we're dealing with right now.
[8112.92 → 8113.12] Yeah.
[8113.46 → 8116.24] And yeah, legislation was too slow for social media.
[8116.24 → 8121.90] We're just now reckoning with all the damage that has been done by social media, in particular to young people.
[8122.38 → 8127.82] And it was glacial compared to the rate at which AI is moving.
[8129.92 → 8130.96] So, yeah.
[8131.28 → 8132.70] F***, basically.
[8133.60 → 8134.84] Good luck, everyone.
[8135.54 → 8135.64] Yeah.
[8135.64 → 8145.78] And I, you know, I, my heart bleeds for that young man's parents and friends and everyone in his life.
[8145.86 → 8155.18] It's, it's the it's the saddest thing in the world to be, to be burying children, burying children.
[8155.18 → 8155.48] Okay.
[8160.48 → 8164.28] And, um, burying my favourite website.
[8164.44 → 8168.88] We've got an update for you guys on the Nantes shutdown.
[8168.88 → 8180.48] Um, after I, uh, kind of talked about what happened last week when Nantes formally, like, seized operations about, about a year ago.
[8180.54 → 8182.04] I think it was last year, 2024, right?
[8182.28 → 8183.20] That sounds right.
[8183.20 → 8183.60] Yeah, I think so.
[8183.66 → 8183.84] Right.
[8183.84 → 8192.94] Um, just a few weeks ago, they took down the archive of articles, which, you know, my understanding at the time of the shutdown had been that those would stay up.
[8193.30 → 8194.64] And they are now gone.
[8194.72 → 8196.08] And we talked about this last week.
[8196.16 → 8196.48] Sounds right.
[8196.48 → 8200.86] And Luke and I shared some theories for why they would have taken them down.
[8201.34 → 8214.30] And, um, luckily, uh, former Nantes editor-in-chief, Ryan Smith happened to see the segment, and he reached out to offer a little bit more insight into, you know, what exactly went down.
[8214.88 → 8220.76] Um, he said that realistically he had not expected future.
[8220.76 → 8228.20] So that's the owner future PLC, um, owner of Nantes, uh, Tom's Hardware, a variety of other publications.
[8228.60 → 8236.42] He hadn't expected them to keep the archive up forever, but he did expect that indefinitely would be longer than 11 months.
[8236.58 → 8242.18] And he personally was caught off guard by the shutdown, finding out about it on Twitter three days after it happened.
[8243.04 → 8250.30] Before it was taken down, there were 27 years of articles in the archive, including 20 years of Ryan's own work.
[8250.76 → 8260.92] He went on to say that he doesn't necessarily think that future had any malice in mind with the shutdown and speculated that they might've just done the math and didn't see enough value in keeping the site up.
[8261.48 → 8266.70] Um, Nantes was hosted on a third party hosting provider on a WISH.
[8266.84 → 8268.18] Do I pronounce that WISH?
[8268.42 → 8269.32] W-I-S-A stack?
[8269.34 → 8271.48] I don't really hear it pronounced too often, but that sounds about right.
[8271.72 → 8274.16] Um, rather than on futures internal CMS.
[8274.16 → 8280.86] So this would probably be because Nantes was acquired as an outside, uh, publication.
[8281.04 → 8283.10] Although, I mean, future would have acquired a variety of other things.
[8283.14 → 8284.70] But it was acquired relatively recently.
[8284.98 → 8289.02] And the performance of the site after the acquisition, I don't think, was very good.
[8289.26 → 8293.22] So there would have been a quantifiable cost to keeping it up.
[8293.22 → 8299.50] And a quantifiable cost to porting that 27 years of articles over to their own CMS.
[8301.00 → 8302.02] Even before the sale.
[8302.18 → 8305.44] So this ended up being more true than I wanted it to be.
[8305.50 → 8307.72] I think I kind of pushed back on this theory.
[8308.16 → 8314.36] But even before the sale, AI crawlers and other bots were a significant problem for the site.
[8314.50 → 8317.68] Crawling and recrawling the site constantly.
[8317.68 → 8322.32] Unfortunately, the extreme load would slow systems to a crawl in the wee hours of the morning.
[8322.54 → 8325.90] Often when Ryan was finalizing articles for the coming day.
[8326.50 → 8335.32] So, um, I think he, he wasn't quite as diplomatic describing the actions of AI bots in his email.
[8335.40 → 8336.52] Did you get a chance to read his email?
[8336.72 → 8340.00] I think he called them f***ING stupid or something like that.
[8340.10 → 8345.48] Because they'll just like, they'll check the same page over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[8345.48 → 8350.04] It's like, bro, what do you imagine has changed since you last checked it three seconds ago?
[8350.68 → 8357.82] Um, but no, apparently that was a significant source of burden for maintaining the site.
[8357.82 → 8359.66] Even before futures acquisition.
[8361.14 → 8367.30] Ryan said that the internet archive seems to have the most complete copy of the site in terms of article pages and assets.
[8368.06 → 8371.62] But the Wayback Machine is unfortunately quite slow.
[8371.62 → 8378.76] The site had more than 20,000 articles and uncompressed used around 300 gigabytes of storage.
[8379.46 → 8380.68] This says...
[8380.68 → 8381.94] Oh, that question from earlier.
[8382.38 → 8383.82] Oh, they're probably gone.
[8383.94 → 8384.94] I never answered that.
[8385.36 → 8385.68] What?
[8385.90 → 8386.26] Sorry.
[8386.60 → 8387.66] The data usage of Flow plane.
[8388.16 → 8396.14] Our biggest bandwidth provider is doing, and we've been above this, and we've been below this, um, 200 terabytes a month.
[8396.14 → 8401.54] There's that answer from a long time ago.
[8401.74 → 8402.28] Is that good?
[8403.96 → 8404.78] Uh, what do you mean?
[8404.92 → 8405.26] I don't know.
[8405.32 → 8406.32] Is that, is that good?
[8406.36 → 8406.88] Is that cool?
[8407.64 → 8408.50] Are we cool?
[8408.58 → 8409.00] Is that a lot?
[8409.06 → 8409.86] Is that enough terabytes?
[8410.50 → 8411.42] Uh, I don't know.
[8411.52 → 8412.90] Is that a cool amount of terabytes?
[8413.04 → 8413.88] We've done more.
[8414.08 → 8415.10] No, no, no.
[8415.16 → 8415.56] We suck.
[8416.52 → 8419.88] Jan Mesh says 200 terabytes seems so much lower than I expected.
[8420.68 → 8421.28] Sorry, Jan Mesh.
[8421.28 → 8426.96] That's one of our providers that doesn't include live-streaming, that doesn't include downloads, it doesn't include a variety of things on the platform.
[8427.20 → 8427.50] Oh.
[8428.16 → 8430.02] Doesn't include, yeah, I don't know.
[8430.02 → 8430.94] So basically you took...
[8430.94 → 8431.48] It's our largest provider.
[8431.52 → 8433.94] You took this long to give a bullshit answer.
[8434.14 → 8435.00] A partial answer, yeah.
[8435.04 → 8435.18] Yeah.
[8436.04 → 8436.24] Yeah.
[8436.38 → 8436.66] Okay.
[8437.88 → 8443.40] Well, uh, and you totally, like, interrupted what we're talking about to bring us that bullshit answer.
[8443.64 → 8443.90] Yeah.
[8444.34 → 8445.04] You know what?
[8445.58 → 8446.48] I'm glad you're here.
[8447.14 → 8447.54] Thanks.
[8449.38 → 8450.64] Thanks for being part of it.
[8451.28 → 8454.16] Oh my goodness.
[8455.48 → 8456.82] People are using small b.
[8456.94 → 8457.48] No, bites.
[8457.90 → 8458.46] Not bits.
[8458.94 → 8459.14] Yeah.
[8459.22 → 8461.88] Some people are using big b, but it's, yeah, it's bites.
[8462.20 → 8462.42] Yep.
[8462.76 → 8464.16] Um, are we sharing this part?
[8465.56 → 8465.90] No.
[8466.22 → 8466.86] Okay, cool.
[8467.00 → 8467.92] We're definitely not.
[8468.00 → 8469.18] We're not talking about that.
[8469.28 → 8469.48] Nope.
[8469.84 → 8470.10] Cool.
[8470.88 → 8476.06] So I'm here to give information to a question for a very long time ago and keep things from the audience.
[8477.14 → 8477.58] Um.
[8477.58 → 8479.40] Hey, Dan.
[8479.90 → 8482.62] Have you thought about swapping chairs with him?
[8483.52 → 8485.36] Because it's, I feel like they'd like it.
[8485.52 → 8486.60] I feel like they'd like it.
[8486.74 → 8488.66] I'd have to get back to you on that in an hour and a half.
[8488.66 → 8493.06] Oh, man.
[8497.60 → 8499.18] We're sure I need you two, right?
[8500.88 → 8501.90] I mean.
[8502.30 → 8506.26] You technically started the show despite it largely being my idea completely by yourself.
[8506.40 → 8506.62] Wait.
[8506.62 → 8506.68] Wait.
[8507.68 → 8508.22] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[8508.22 → 8508.50] Hold on.
[8508.54 → 8510.14] I actually don't know if I remember this.
[8512.28 → 8513.60] The idea thing?
[8513.96 → 8514.92] Yeah, the idea thing.
[8515.10 → 8515.28] Yeah.
[8515.36 → 8520.18] Remember, we would drive home from NCI and talk about tech stuff, and I was like, we should
[8520.18 → 8520.74] really have a show.
[8520.74 → 8522.20] You know this was like 14 years ago now or something, right?
[8522.40 → 8522.82] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8522.82 → 8523.00] Okay.
[8523.10 → 8523.44] Yeah, yeah.
[8523.50 → 8523.64] Okay.
[8524.56 → 8525.68] No, so I'm, oh, sorry.
[8525.76 → 8526.64] No, I'm saying I don't remember.
[8526.72 → 8526.90] S***.
[8527.30 → 8527.54] Okay.
[8527.68 → 8527.82] So.
[8527.82 → 8528.28] Yeah, okay.
[8528.28 → 8532.74] Like even our, the first interview I ever had with Linus, Linus drove me home.
[8533.22 → 8533.62] That makes sense.
[8533.62 → 8538.04] Because the interview was like many hours long and the buses stopped running.
[8538.10 → 8538.60] That makes sense.
[8538.68 → 8539.82] So I didn't have a way to get home.
[8539.96 → 8542.78] I mean, yeah, it's a totally safe thing to do when you go interview somewhere.
[8542.96 → 8547.24] You go into the, you know, windowless room with the couch, and then they offer you a ride
[8547.24 → 8548.24] home, and you take the ride.
[8548.36 → 8548.84] There were windows.
[8548.96 → 8549.50] They were just blocked.
[8550.80 → 8551.58] I don't know if that was better.
[8551.68 → 8552.26] He's not wrong.
[8552.26 → 8559.04] Um, and, and then it became relatively common routine because we always finished at like
[8559.04 → 8559.52] Yeah.
[8560.36 → 8561.22] Midnight or later.
[8561.36 → 8561.56] Yeah.
[8561.68 → 8563.64] So Linus would drive me home like all the time.
[8563.70 → 8563.90] Yeah.
[8563.98 → 8566.50] And we just talk about tech stuff on the drive home all the time.
[8566.58 → 8567.80] It's all we've ever really talked about.
[8568.58 → 8573.10] And then I was pushing that like, you know, people would probably be interested in this.
[8573.32 → 8575.06] We should do like a show thing.
[8575.70 → 8577.92] And then you just started it by yourself.
[8577.92 → 8584.46] And the first like few WAN shows for a while, I think a couple of months or something, were
[8584.46 → 8585.24] just Linus.
[8585.46 → 8587.14] And then I joined on eventually.
[8587.48 → 8590.94] So the way I, I don't actually remember this.
[8590.94 → 8594.70] You have a different retelling of this, which sounds like we probably had somewhat parallel
[8594.70 → 8598.84] ideas, but I had the car talks idea before WAN show started.
[8598.90 → 8600.20] So I'm still claiming part of it.
[8600.46 → 8600.76] Yeah.
[8600.90 → 8602.56] I mean, I know you have a you had a different.
[8602.74 → 8604.32] So I'll be honest with you.
[8604.40 → 8606.76] I don't remember my version of events anymore.
[8606.76 → 8609.06] Whatever it was, I know it was different.
[8609.34 → 8610.04] I do.
[8610.26 → 8613.32] You had some, there was some other reason why you wanted it.
[8613.42 → 8615.78] I wanted it because the car talks thing seemed cool.
[8616.12 → 8620.16] And I actually expected us to like literally just actually record it in the car.
[8620.54 → 8623.38] And it was going to be an actual podcast, not a video podcast.
[8623.68 → 8624.04] Interesting.
[8624.48 → 8630.68] So what I do remember from that time is that unbox therapy was the existential threat to
[8630.68 → 8631.84] unboxing videos.
[8632.24 → 8632.88] Sup, Lou?
[8633.92 → 8635.44] Man, we haven't chatted in forever.
[8635.44 → 8638.18] Dude, I've become kind of like a hermit.
[8638.28 → 8641.12] Although, oh, hey, another cool video to tease.
[8641.52 → 8647.08] We went down to California, and we built a sick NAS into Kyle from Nitwit's desk.
[8647.58 → 8647.82] Nice.
[8648.44 → 8650.42] It's like actually great.
[8650.50 → 8654.84] We kind of did like a, like a setup doctor slash ultimate tech upgrade.
[8654.98 → 8656.00] Intel sponsored it.
[8656.00 → 8661.10] So we, we built like a sick Intel based NAS, and it's like, it's like built into a sit
[8661.10 → 8665.74] stand desk because why wouldn't you have a NAS just like built under your desk?
[8665.86 → 8666.06] Sure.
[8666.14 → 8667.36] So it just, I don't know.
[8667.44 → 8668.94] It plugs into his switch was right there.
[8668.98 → 8670.98] We did a bunch of like cable management, put in some shelves.
[8671.12 → 8671.92] Adam and I did it.
[8672.00 → 8672.80] It's going to be awesome.
[8672.86 → 8673.08] Anyway.
[8673.08 → 8676.96] Um, so yeah, uh, unbox therapy was like an existential threat.
[8677.28 → 8682.92] And I remember that like live seemed like another existential threat.
[8682.92 → 8685.38] It was something that I did not understand really at all.
[8685.54 → 8686.98] Like what the appeal was.
[8687.44 → 8694.12] Um, cause remember too, that this is back when like, like, um, ephemeral temporary things
[8694.12 → 8697.96] were, were super trendy, like periscope, like, yeah, you're live.
[8697.96 → 8700.50] And then, and then after you're live, there's no GOD it's gone.
[8700.50 → 8707.40] And I was like, okay, so that seems dumb because then you can never refer back to it.
[8707.48 → 8712.76] Um, which in retrospect, maybe I should have done most of my career like that because I
[8712.76 → 8714.72] would have saved myself a lot of controversies.
[8715.64 → 8721.20] Um, and I remember just wanting some kind of foothold in live.
[8721.22 → 8726.22] And what I came up with was Q and A's, which was not your pitch at all.
[8726.22 → 8729.00] This sounds accurate to what I've heard you say in the past.
[8729.04 → 8729.30] Okay.
[8729.42 → 8729.62] Yeah.
[8729.68 → 8732.92] I remember pushing for the car talks thing like many times.
[8733.04 → 8734.46] So this is the original show.
[8734.60 → 8736.72] I think this is the very first live stream, right?
[8736.86 → 8737.10] Yes.
[8737.48 → 8740.28] And then it looks like you did two months of these.
[8740.36 → 8741.78] Linus Tech Tips live show.
[8741.80 → 8743.22] So one, two, three, four.
[8743.36 → 8745.96] No, I think the first one is called Q and A though.
[8746.72 → 8749.56] This is maybe the first one in the playlist.
[8749.56 → 8751.04] This is the first that I remember.
[8751.36 → 8752.70] This isn't even our playlist.
[8753.28 → 8755.02] Our playlist only goes back to like 2021.
[8755.02 → 8755.22] 2021.
[8755.62 → 8756.82] Is there an older one?
[8757.28 → 8758.60] This is the first one I remember.
[8758.74 → 8759.40] I could be wrong.
[8760.62 → 8760.96] Yeah.
[8761.80 → 8762.68] September 2020.
[8763.00 → 8763.94] I remember that.
[8763.94 → 8764.54] September 2012.
[8764.88 → 8764.98] Sorry.
[8765.06 → 8770.12] You can barely tell with the crappy dynamic range, but it has horizontal pink and white stripes.
[8770.46 → 8770.70] Oh yeah.
[8770.72 → 8771.64] You can sort of.
[8771.88 → 8772.98] What was I thinking?
[8774.60 → 8775.30] You know?
[8776.22 → 8779.00] No wonder only 37,000 people watched it.
[8779.24 → 8779.76] It's trash.
[8779.82 → 8780.28] How did the second one?
[8780.28 → 8780.62] It's trash.
[8780.70 → 8781.16] Get rid of it.
[8782.62 → 8783.38] Even worse.
[8783.38 → 8785.12] And then.
[8785.32 → 8787.34] Well, you can't keep doing the same thing over and over again.
[8787.34 → 8788.08] A little bit more.
[8788.90 → 8790.42] And then a little bit more.
[8791.46 → 8791.72] No, no.
[8791.72 → 8793.08] It's going to get way better when you join.
[8793.20 → 8793.70] Hey, look at this.
[8793.70 → 8794.46] I've got a monitor.
[8794.66 → 8795.66] That's a pretty good idea.
[8795.94 → 8796.92] Oh, you're up quite a bit.
[8798.62 → 8800.08] The set's a little better now.
[8802.04 → 8803.54] The shirt's cooler now.
[8803.58 → 8803.88] What's with this haircut?
[8804.02 → 8804.74] Look at this haircut.
[8805.10 → 8805.38] It's trash.
[8805.38 → 8807.22] You got the flying V going on in your head.
[8807.58 → 8808.22] Trash haircut.
[8808.22 → 8810.68] The couch shows up.
[8810.84 → 8811.74] Oh, it's a couch.
[8812.74 → 8813.54] Let's go.
[8814.76 → 8815.44] And then.
[8815.52 → 8815.76] Hold on.
[8815.82 → 8816.66] Where's broken wing?
[8816.66 → 8817.52] The couch still exists.
[8817.68 → 8818.16] Where's broken wing?
[8818.16 → 8819.12] Broken wing shows up.
[8819.16 → 8819.70] How does it do?
[8820.60 → 8820.92] Boom.
[8821.00 → 8822.52] Hey, the WAN show.
[8822.70 → 8823.84] That's the first WAN show.
[8823.92 → 8825.32] November 9th, 2012.
[8827.38 → 8828.08] Heck yeah.
[8829.68 → 8831.00] How does a follow-up do?
[8831.06 → 8832.82] In case you're wondering, he got hit by a car.
[8832.96 → 8834.04] Not nearly as well.
[8834.04 → 8834.48] Yeah.
[8836.02 → 8836.36] Yeah.
[8836.82 → 8840.14] I, um, dude, the scars that I have from that still exist.
[8840.30 → 8840.74] And I got.
[8840.86 → 8842.16] Well, that's how scars work.
[8842.26 → 8842.60] Well, yeah.
[8842.76 → 8844.38] It's not a scar if it goes away.
[8844.76 → 8845.68] I'm just saying.
[8845.72 → 8846.38] The labs team.
[8846.42 → 8849.04] It's one of those things where people will walk in.
[8849.10 → 8851.34] They'll be like, man, you wouldn't believe it.
[8851.36 → 8851.94] This is crazy.
[8852.00 → 8853.80] I got electrocuted by the toaster.
[8853.84 → 8856.06] And I'm like, bro, stop right now.
[8856.90 → 8859.64] Because if you're not dead, you were not electrocuted.
[8859.64 → 8860.00] Yeah.
[8860.36 → 8863.54] It's like poisonous and poison and venom.
[8864.04 → 8864.70] Mm.
[8865.12 → 8865.42] Yeah.
[8865.82 → 8866.26] Yeah.
[8866.26 → 8866.46] Yeah.
[8867.12 → 8868.54] But yeah, poisonous and venomous.
[8868.58 → 8869.82] So you have a permanent scar.
[8869.94 → 8870.14] Yes.
[8870.22 → 8870.56] Carry on.
[8870.56 → 8871.84] Tell us about your scar.
[8872.16 → 8873.14] All my knuckles on this hand.
[8873.26 → 8873.56] It's permanent.
[8873.94 → 8877.40] And I got shot in airsoft directly on one of them.
[8877.52 → 8879.46] And it already sucks to get shot in a knuckle.
[8879.86 → 8882.24] And then it's like also on the scarring.
[8882.70 → 8883.94] And it really sucks.
[8884.16 → 8884.78] That's so funny.
[8885.16 → 8888.02] I got shot in the knuckle playing airsoft just the other day.
[8888.04 → 8888.68] I think this is it.
[8889.82 → 8890.42] Oh, yeah.
[8890.42 → 8896.58] I bought a couple of just like crappy little like spring load airsoft pistols.
[8896.86 → 8898.10] Don't demonetize me, YouTube.
[8898.88 → 8900.60] I made a gun shape with my hand.
[8900.74 → 8901.04] Oh, boy.
[8901.04 → 8902.06] It's a walkie-talkie shape.
[8902.30 → 8902.54] Yeah.
[8903.28 → 8903.66] Check, check.
[8903.80 → 8904.12] Roger.
[8904.54 → 8904.92] Over.
[8905.88 → 8906.28] Wilcox.
[8907.22 → 8907.86] Team speak.
[8907.94 → 8908.70] You already said over.
[8910.00 → 8910.40] Copy.
[8911.30 → 8912.28] 10-4, good buddy.
[8912.28 → 8915.92] Anyway, yeah, that's such a coincidence.
[8916.16 → 8917.72] I was just goofing around with the kid.
[8917.78 → 8918.84] What were you doing playing airsoft?
[8919.22 → 8919.86] With the live stream.
[8920.40 → 8921.74] I know, but it's for the sake of that.
[8921.74 → 8922.66] Oh, we were just hanging out.
[8922.66 → 8926.80] Remember the whole thing where we talked throughout the week, and we pretend we haven't talked to each other?
[8927.54 → 8933.30] There was a long period where we really hadn't talked to each other at all other than Sancho throughout the week.
[8933.92 → 8940.38] Yeah, there was an initiative from mostly, I don't know if they want to be named for this or not.
[8940.86 → 8943.66] So I will not, but maybe, I don't know.
[8943.72 → 8944.20] Does that matter?
[8944.40 → 8945.36] Should I just say it?
[8945.60 → 8946.06] I don't know.
[8946.12 → 8947.42] I have no idea what you're talking about.
[8947.42 → 8954.66] One of the labs members is very into it and basically put out an inquiry of like, are other labs people interested in going?
[8955.62 → 8957.18] And people were, so they went.
[8957.82 → 8961.26] And I think it's open to people outside of labs as well.
[8961.26 → 8964.12] But like, it's easier to organize within your own little group.
[8964.20 → 8965.92] So it's mostly just been lab stuff so far.
[8966.78 → 8967.46] And then.
[8967.60 → 8968.18] I didn't get an invitation.
[8968.86 → 8971.06] I literally invited you last time.
[8971.46 → 8973.74] I invited you to come to the next one last time.
[8974.52 → 8976.52] I can go find the message.
[8976.70 → 8977.06] Okay.
[8977.06 → 8980.90] I mean, if you don't tell me when the next time is coming, that's not really a very good invite.
[8981.02 → 8982.32] I think we figured out a date today.
[8982.32 → 8983.14] It's not like a birthday.
[8983.32 → 8984.02] I haven't had time.
[8984.06 → 8988.74] It's not like a birthday where I could say, hey, well, I'd love to have you at my next birthday.
[8988.74 → 8990.96] And it will be on a consistent date.
[8992.40 → 8994.88] It's often not.
[8996.38 → 8998.90] Birthday parties are often not on a specific date.
[8998.94 → 8999.94] I didn't say birthday party.
[9000.06 → 9000.86] I said birthday.
[9001.36 → 9002.18] Oh, okay.
[9002.28 → 9002.52] Yeah.
[9003.52 → 9003.78] Boom.
[9003.88 → 9005.14] Who gets invited to a birthday?
[9005.50 → 9005.72] Boom.
[9007.00 → 9007.58] Well, not me.
[9007.58 → 9010.44] Oh, I'd like your presence to be there during a birthday.
[9010.66 → 9010.86] Yeah.
[9011.02 → 9011.94] Not the birthday party.
[9011.94 → 9014.20] Birthday parties on the weekend, you're not invited to that.
[9014.20 → 9016.72] But I would like you to be there.
[9017.70 → 9018.64] Just around.
[9020.68 → 9021.56] I'm going to go to work.
[9021.58 → 9024.24] If you could just come with me, that'd be great.
[9027.28 → 9027.72] Wow.
[9027.90 → 9028.20] That was...
[9028.92 → 9030.24] I'm good.
[9030.64 → 9031.00] Wow.
[9032.08 → 9033.88] That sounded like it was probably very satisfying.
[9034.20 → 9034.52] Yeah.
[9035.16 → 9037.64] It was in between satisfying and painful.
[9037.64 → 9037.96] Painful?
[9038.18 → 9038.44] Dang.
[9038.56 → 9038.70] Yeah.
[9038.70 → 9038.96] All right.
[9039.12 → 9042.38] Well, anyway, I have no idea where we're at right now.
[9042.46 → 9043.72] Let's do another topic, maybe?
[9043.72 → 9046.76] Spotify is adding direct messages.
[9047.80 → 9048.24] What?
[9050.12 → 9050.72] What?
[9051.76 → 9052.12] Why?
[9053.12 → 9055.12] Well, the rest of it is for some reason.
[9057.04 → 9058.50] What is the point in this?
[9061.20 → 9066.12] You can send a DM from a song.
[9066.12 → 9068.22] Send the song link as a DM.
[9069.32 → 9070.94] So conversation can follow.
[9071.20 → 9071.96] About the song?
[9071.96 → 9074.32] No one needed this.
[9074.42 → 9076.50] You can send a song link off platform.
[9076.86 → 9085.78] And when that person opens it, it can play from Spotify from within their DMs so that you can reply there instead of off platform.
[9085.78 → 9090.58] This can be clicked on by people who aren't your Spotify friend.
[9090.98 → 9093.90] They have to request to DM you.
[9095.58 → 9096.50] Basically...
[9096.50 → 9101.48] Some development unit within Spotify just really, really needed something to do.
[9101.48 → 9104.80] I have to imagine that that's how this went down.
[9105.38 → 9106.02] Or...
[9106.02 → 9106.78] Or...
[9106.78 → 9107.44] Hear me out.
[9110.44 → 9113.66] Absolutely everything needs DMs now.
[9114.54 → 9122.06] And Spotify just was recognizing an overwhelming trend and was compelled to get on board.
[9122.06 → 9127.42] Dude, do you have any idea how many apps on my phone...
[9127.42 → 9128.28] It's way too many.
[9128.32 → 9130.78] ...are capable of sending messages to other people?
[9131.50 → 9136.88] I do not need more apps to send messages.
[9136.88 → 9138.88] Yeah.
[9140.88 → 9141.68] Like, I'm...
[9141.68 → 9143.76] I'm a messaging chameleon.
[9144.18 → 9156.50] Like, on my phone right now, with unread messages, I have WhatsApp, I have SMS, I have email, and I have Teams.
[9156.50 → 9162.76] That's just with unread messages in the period of time since I've last touched my phone and cleared things that I don't need.
[9163.00 → 9168.60] Other than that, I have Discord, WeChat, Messenger, Instagram.
[9169.56 → 9170.46] I have...
[9170.46 → 9171.62] TikTok has DMs, right?
[9172.64 → 9173.70] I have Steam Chat.
[9175.30 → 9176.98] Like...
[9176.98 → 9177.72] Oh, I've...
[9177.72 → 9178.76] Does Twitch have DMs?
[9179.08 → 9179.74] I'm trying to remember.
[9181.70 → 9183.18] Meanwhile, he's just reading his DMs.
[9183.18 → 9184.98] No, I have to read this now message.
[9185.26 → 9186.18] Twitch does have DMs.
[9186.50 → 9187.06] Yeah, okay.
[9188.02 → 9189.06] How could I possibly...
[9189.84 → 9191.06] Oh, yeah, I forgot about Gmail.
[9191.94 → 9194.28] Also has chat built into it.
[9194.84 → 9195.28] There's...
[9195.28 → 9197.22] There's too many!
[9197.90 → 9198.26] I...
[9198.26 → 9198.66] Oh.
[9198.94 → 9199.36] Oh, yeah.
[9199.46 → 9204.00] No, I don't use it regularly, but I have Signal, I think it is.
[9204.06 → 9205.06] I have one of the...
[9205.64 → 9207.76] I have either Signal or Telegram or something.
[9208.68 → 9213.00] Occasionally, there's a contact that will message me there, so I have to make sure that I have it.
[9213.06 → 9214.36] I have to have all the things.
[9214.36 → 9221.42] I mean, and I'm not even counting the ones that do have specific DM function, like Uber, where you can DM your driver.
[9221.58 → 9222.54] I'm not going to count that.
[9222.92 → 9223.62] I'm not going to count that.
[9223.64 → 9225.14] I'm just saying, there's...
[9225.14 → 9228.32] I mean, you can DM people through Google Docs if you really want to.
[9228.38 → 9228.92] There's just...
[9228.92 → 9235.30] There's no shortage of places that I can send direct messages, and I don't need more of them.
[9235.38 → 9236.52] Thank you very much, Spotify.
[9236.52 → 9244.86] Please screw off with your social media building features of your website because...
[9244.86 → 9247.06] And this really is the biggest reason.
[9247.48 → 9250.08] Because normally, I could just ignore it.
[9250.20 → 9252.58] I could pretend that this feature completely doesn't exist.
[9252.58 → 9262.30] But what another DM inbox means to me is another place that I can get spammed and that I can get notifications cluttering up my biz.
[9266.14 → 9266.90] Please stop.
[9268.98 → 9270.58] No more notifications.
[9270.98 → 9271.88] No more inboxes.
[9271.96 → 9273.26] Do you need another inbox, Luke?
[9273.52 → 9274.62] I wish I had less.
[9274.62 → 9279.54] So the reason why I originally picked up my phone was to check the like, messages.
[9280.36 → 9280.68] Communication.
[9281.78 → 9282.10] Nice.
[9282.42 → 9283.88] Yeah, just too many.
[9284.14 → 9284.54] Oh, yeah.
[9284.56 → 9285.58] You got threads in there.
[9285.64 → 9286.60] You got blue sky.
[9287.94 → 9288.84] Why are they all blue?
[9288.84 → 9291.28] Signal, Line, WeChat, Meet, WhatsApp.
[9291.28 → 9291.80] All blue.
[9291.88 → 9292.44] Other Meet.
[9292.50 → 9292.80] Oh, yeah.
[9292.86 → 9294.02] I have Line on my other phone.
[9294.24 → 9296.50] Facebook, Threads, Teams, Telegram, Messenger.
[9296.76 → 9299.32] A lot of these, I never, ever use them.
[9299.42 → 9304.60] And you know that some non-tech-savvy person with Spotify is going to get some spam Nigerian
[9304.60 → 9305.68] prints DM.
[9305.94 → 9308.84] And, like, it's just, it's another bloody attack vector.
[9309.02 → 9310.60] And it doesn't need to be there.
[9310.68 → 9314.00] A lot of these, it's because, like, one person that I know uses it.
[9314.16 → 9316.26] And they just, like, refuse to use anything else.
[9316.30 → 9319.88] And it's like, okay, I guess.
[9319.88 → 9322.26] I mean, that's why I have one of mine.
[9322.84 → 9325.14] And the person who won't use anything else is you.
[9326.36 → 9329.40] There's no way you don't have other people that you communicate with over that.
[9329.74 → 9330.24] On Discord?
[9330.48 → 9330.70] Yeah.
[9331.18 → 9332.02] There's no way.
[9332.02 → 9335.78] You have played games of other people on Discord when I am not there.
[9336.18 → 9336.76] That has happened.
[9336.76 → 9338.52] I wouldn't need it on my phone for anyone else.
[9338.70 → 9339.00] Oh.
[9340.00 → 9346.02] Like, here, look how far you have to go to find people I haven't spoken to in over a month.
[9347.22 → 9348.38] You are literally.
[9348.44 → 9349.42] We can use something else.
[9349.42 → 9349.54] You are.
[9349.72 → 9350.72] We can use something else.
[9351.22 → 9355.82] I, now, I understand his hesitation.
[9355.82 → 9359.06] But I have told you, I'm on WhatsApp.
[9359.50 → 9361.06] That's what I primarily use.
[9361.06 → 9361.16] Oh, I hate WhatsApp.
[9363.40 → 9367.02] So you're the guy that is the reason that I haven't used Discord on mobile.
[9367.02 → 9368.04] I do love it now, though.
[9368.18 → 9368.82] You're the guy.
[9368.84 → 9370.08] If you really want to use it.
[9370.16 → 9370.92] You're the guy, Luke.
[9370.94 → 9371.68] It's installed now.
[9371.76 → 9372.42] But you know what?
[9372.48 → 9373.36] You know what this means?
[9374.06 → 9375.24] Is I would do that for you.
[9375.52 → 9375.84] Oh.
[9376.62 → 9377.20] I would.
[9377.72 → 9379.14] I would do that for you.
[9379.24 → 9380.10] You are worth.
[9380.12 → 9380.50] That's pretty cute.
[9380.66 → 9381.92] You are worth maintaining.
[9382.26 → 9382.78] When I get.
[9383.10 → 9390.24] See, honestly, this is actually kind of hilarious because I think that would be a super cool feature
[9390.24 → 9399.74] for a messaging app if the icon, the like, lock screen icon could be different for your
[9399.74 → 9406.18] different contacts because when I get a Discord icon, I know it's probably you.
[9407.70 → 9409.64] That actually, that would be kind of cool.
[9409.96 → 9410.64] I don't think that's.
[9410.64 → 9414.48] Maybe what we should do is we should build DMs into Flow plane.
[9415.88 → 9421.40] We'll turn Flow plane into a messaging platform, and that'll be our key feature is you can assign
[9421.40 → 9427.54] a different notification icon to your key contacts so that at a glance, you can, like,
[9427.64 → 9429.54] be excited to hear from your BFF.
[9429.74 → 9430.68] Is that possible?
[9430.80 → 9431.56] Oh, probably not.
[9431.58 → 9431.92] I don't care.
[9432.02 → 9433.00] I don't think so.
[9433.16 → 9436.04] I'm just saying that whenever I get a.
[9436.06 → 9437.62] Call Flow plane DMs airmail.
[9438.10 → 9438.74] Whenever I see.
[9443.26 → 9446.24] Sorry, it scrolled off my screen, but that was a great idea.
[9446.36 → 9447.50] No, it's not a great idea.
[9447.50 → 9448.14] It's 2025.
[9448.14 → 9448.68] That was Loki.
[9449.32 → 9450.30] It's 2025.
[9450.88 → 9452.18] It has to be air gender-neutral.
[9453.72 → 9454.86] He's not there to ding me.
[9454.94 → 9455.32] Dang it.
[9455.44 → 9456.56] It wasn't even worth it.
[9459.74 → 9465.24] Yep.
[9469.92 → 9470.70] Guess what?
[9472.40 → 9472.84] What?
[9473.10 → 9473.56] Monkey butt.
[9473.66 → 9474.98] Scrappy Wars is ready to publish.
[9475.56 → 9476.12] Oh, okay.
[9476.18 → 9476.38] Sure.
[9476.42 → 9477.28] Let's do that thing.
[9477.42 → 9477.82] Yeah.
[9480.04 → 9481.18] Flowplane.com.
[9481.44 → 9481.88] All right.
[9481.90 → 9482.44] I'm doing it.
[9482.46 → 9482.92] I'm doing it.
[9482.92 → 9484.50] Do you want to start another topic in the meantime?
[9485.38 → 9485.78] Sure.
[9487.90 → 9488.72] Oh, no.
[9488.78 → 9489.46] That's your topic.
[9489.58 → 9490.44] I will leave you that.
[9490.54 → 9491.46] I know you want that.
[9492.16 → 9493.08] I want a topic?
[9493.24 → 9494.00] You want a topic.
[9495.02 → 9496.56] You want it pretty bad, I think.
[9496.94 → 9497.32] Do I?
[9497.54 → 9497.78] Yep.
[9498.16 → 9498.46] Okay.
[9498.48 → 9498.94] Hold on here.
[9499.94 → 9500.34] Okay.
[9500.36 → 9500.86] We're doing it.
[9500.90 → 9501.76] I can do this other one.
[9502.06 → 9502.58] We're doing it.
[9502.66 → 9503.12] Scrapyard Wars.
[9503.16 → 9503.38] Boom.
[9504.72 → 9505.70] She's live, baby.
[9506.18 → 9507.28] Scrapyard Wars part three.
[9507.48 → 9507.96] Let's go.
[9507.96 → 9511.80] And this really, this really was the vibe.
[9515.80 → 9516.28] Man.
[9516.28 → 9516.80] I.
[9520.48 → 9523.62] Your team went through some things.
[9525.92 → 9527.80] I just watched it this morning.
[9528.20 → 9528.76] Wow.
[9530.68 → 9531.32] Wow.
[9532.48 → 9533.86] I haven't seen it yet.
[9534.20 → 9535.76] I can only imagine.
[9536.38 → 9536.66] Yeah.
[9537.96 → 9540.56] This is, this isn't the end, right?
[9540.68 → 9540.96] No.
[9541.16 → 9541.78] Oh, yeah.
[9542.06 → 9542.32] No.
[9542.36 → 9547.18] The last one has the last two hours of scramble on the final morning and the judging.
[9547.50 → 9548.52] So that'll be coming.
[9548.74 → 9549.98] So there's more to go for sure.
[9549.98 → 9550.72] There's more to go.
[9550.80 → 9551.96] That last two hours is.
[9552.72 → 9553.20] I can.
[9553.38 → 9556.08] No, they tee up the last two hours very well.
[9556.18 → 9557.46] It's full of stuff.
[9557.58 → 9557.84] Yeah.
[9558.54 → 9558.86] Yep.
[9558.86 → 9563.50] There will be a commentary version on float plane.
[9563.72 → 9565.08] The not so bright says.
[9565.24 → 9565.58] Oh, really?
[9565.84 → 9566.02] Yeah.
[9566.48 → 9567.88] We announced that earlier this show.
[9568.54 → 9569.10] So you.
[9569.16 → 9569.74] Who's commenting?
[9569.86 → 9570.72] Clearly weren't paying attention.
[9571.16 → 9572.64] There's going to be a live stream.
[9573.00 → 9574.66] I think in a couple of weeks.
[9574.86 → 9575.58] Who's doing that?
[9576.16 → 9576.56] Um.
[9576.68 → 9577.06] Everybody.
[9577.60 → 9577.80] Yeah.
[9577.84 → 9578.42] Except us.
[9578.98 → 9579.24] Oh.
[9579.60 → 9579.74] Yeah.
[9579.74 → 9580.44] You don't get to be involved.
[9580.52 → 9580.58] Yeah.
[9580.58 → 9581.66] We get no voice in this.
[9581.88 → 9582.02] Oh boy.
[9582.70 → 9584.06] So our teams get to say.
[9584.18 → 9586.46] Get to say exactly what they think of us.
[9586.54 → 9587.20] And our leadership.
[9591.00 → 9592.48] I'm probably going to get flayed.
[9592.60 → 9593.62] And it's probably fine.
[9594.10 → 9596.28] I was barely alive that whole week.
[9596.40 → 9596.70] Yeah.
[9596.86 → 9599.82] It's a float plane exclusive on September 9th.
[9599.94 → 9600.34] All right.
[9602.48 → 9602.96] Uh.
[9603.06 → 9603.48] Okay.
[9604.14 → 9606.72] Florida and Texas have teamed up to save the children.
[9607.10 → 9610.54] Schools in Florida districts will begin training the use of armed.
[9610.96 → 9611.28] What?
[9612.02 → 9618.26] What are we doing?
[9622.30 → 9630.74] They're going to be trialling the use of armed drones to respond to school shooting incidents
[9630.74 → 9632.98] starting in the coming school year.
[9633.50 → 9637.06] The drones, a product of campus guardian angel.
[9638.68 → 9639.20] Sorry.
[9639.32 → 9640.24] It's not funny.
[9640.40 → 9641.12] It's just.
[9641.12 → 9642.42] We'll be secure.
[9642.42 → 9642.82] Why?
[9643.12 → 9647.36] Why are we living in the actual dumbest possible timeline?
[9649.36 → 9656.56] The drones, a product of campus guardian angel, which sounds like the evil corporation in a video game,
[9656.56 → 9664.80] will be securely pre-positioned on charging pads on the school property starting in September and October.
[9664.80 → 9669.04] They're going to reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour indoors.
[9669.04 → 9673.04] And 100 miles per hour outdoors, allowing them to quickly cover large campuses.
[9673.04 → 9688.76] The drones are flown remotely by operators at the company's Austin headquarters and can provide real-time video to first responders and deploy non-lethal and less lethal, which is always a really fun term.
[9688.76 → 9690.60] What does less lethal mean?
[9690.60 → 9692.50] It means you probably won't die.
[9694.90 → 9696.84] Anyway, less lethal weapons.
[9697.06 → 9698.20] Well, it depends on where you get hit.
[9699.40 → 9700.36] You got two arms.
[9700.36 → 9705.54] Yeah, I mean, even a 22 is going to get you if it goes right between your rib cage and into your heart.
[9706.62 → 9711.54] And your eyeball can also be a rough one because you got a bunch of brain goop back there.
[9711.84 → 9713.08] I mean, speak for yourself.
[9715.48 → 9716.34] I said you.
[9717.38 → 9717.96] You've got.
[9719.06 → 9720.02] No, I said I.
[9720.22 → 9721.96] You got a lot of brain goop going on.
[9721.96 → 9722.64] I meant what I said.
[9722.66 → 9723.68] You got that good brain goop.
[9723.82 → 9724.24] Thank you.
[9724.36 → 9725.14] I appreciate that.
[9725.18 → 9725.72] No problem.
[9725.72 → 9728.20] If I understood what you said, which I don't think I do.
[9730.80 → 9731.16] Anyway.
[9732.66 → 9733.02] Yeah.
[9733.12 → 9738.60] So they can do non-lethal and less lethal weapons to distract, disorient, and incapacitate shooters.
[9739.68 → 9742.32] The system is expected to be fully operational by January.
[9742.50 → 9743.10] Discussion question.
[9743.28 → 9746.34] How would you feel about this kind of system being installed at your kids' school?
[9748.36 → 9749.54] I'm going to be honest with you.
[9750.68 → 9754.76] If my kids went to school in Florida, I'd actually probably be glad that it's there.
[9755.72 → 9759.30] And I realize that's going to be, I don't know.
[9759.48 → 9768.52] I always find it interesting seeing the way that the buckets that people kind of try to fit me into.
[9768.82 → 9770.78] I think there's going to be a lot of people that.
[9770.88 → 9771.82] They're like, wait.
[9772.38 → 9774.78] Find that to be a very unexpected take.
[9775.02 → 9777.02] I'm a lot less concerned now that I read the whole thing.
[9777.08 → 9780.76] When I first read armed drones, usually when you say armed, you mean like.
[9781.22 → 9781.60] Firearm.
[9781.70 → 9781.96] Yeah.
[9782.24 → 9782.46] Yep.
[9782.46 → 9784.76] I thought it was flying drone with a gun.
[9784.76 → 9788.38] And now it's like flying drone with maybe a gun that shoots beanbags.
[9788.84 → 9790.52] Those beanbags can be really brutal.
[9790.92 → 9792.90] But it also said non-lethal.
[9793.10 → 9802.60] And if it's like a drone that whips over to an area and can get to a target and like, you know, I don't know, mace or whatever else.
[9802.60 → 9814.36] Put some type of, you know, irritant agent, whatever they're called that like make you cry, and you can't see very well necessarily.
[9814.62 → 9814.76] Yep.
[9814.76 → 9816.80] So that you can't execute your plan.
[9817.10 → 9817.26] Yep.
[9817.72 → 9818.76] That could be pretty good.
[9818.76 → 9822.04] In areas where this is consistently a problem.
[9822.36 → 9822.54] Yep.
[9824.04 → 9824.48] Pepper ball.
[9824.64 → 9825.46] Pepper ball's a thing.
[9826.08 → 9826.26] Yep.
[9826.36 → 9827.48] I mean, look, I had.
[9828.92 → 9830.92] Taser's interesting because people have died from tasers.
[9831.50 → 9831.78] Yeah.
[9831.88 → 9834.10] Taser's a tough one, but it does save.
[9834.36 → 9835.52] It's also a lot harder to aim.
[9836.28 → 9836.56] Yeah.
[9836.78 → 9841.04] Tasers are like you got to be exactly the right distance from the target and all that.
[9841.22 → 9843.04] If they're wearing like a thick sweater or a jacket.
[9843.26 → 9844.92] You know, this, this actually reminds me.
[9845.00 → 9854.04] There's a there's an anti-theft, like that, like a burglary countermeasure that you can deploy in stores that basically just puts out like a thick fog.
[9855.00 → 9859.10] And as much as, okay, just hear me out.
[9859.14 → 9860.26] How toxic is that to breathe?
[9860.26 → 9860.70] Hear me out.
[9861.14 → 9862.22] Apparently it's non-toxic.
[9862.22 → 9868.20] Um, but I'm not actually advocating for the thick fog, but you did bring up irritants.
[9868.52 → 9868.68] Yeah.
[9868.80 → 9880.24] Like, would I rather that an entire school of children gets pepper sprayed or would I rather, but, but it incapacitates an attacker.
[9881.46 → 9892.20] Um, or would I rather let a couple lambs be, um, I don't think anyone's ever died from, from an eye.
[9892.22 → 9892.66] Irritant.
[9892.90 → 9893.26] Yes.
[9893.30 → 9894.12] Although rare.
[9894.80 → 9895.24] Really?
[9895.44 → 9899.88] Deaths have been linked to pepper spray, particularly in cases where the person has underlying health conditions.
[9900.82 → 9901.44] What about an allergy?
[9901.74 → 9904.52] Subjected to other restraining techniques during the pepper spray.
[9904.58 → 9905.38] That's also interesting.
[9905.96 → 9911.10] Or had a severe reaction to the spray, such as something I can't properly pronounce.
[9911.20 → 9911.66] This is the one.
[9911.72 → 9912.32] Security fog.
[9912.32 → 9913.34] Security fog.
[9913.34 → 9917.32] How thick is this fog?
[9917.44 → 9917.92] It's thick.
[9917.92 → 9919.48] That looks pretty thick.
[9921.18 → 9923.42] She's thick like, damn girl, she's thick.
[9923.54 → 9925.12] Like, you're not finding anything in there.
[9926.80 → 9927.24] Wow.
[9927.28 → 9935.54] So the idea is to, uh, disorient, um, anyone who's trying to, like, find stuff and move around.
[9935.62 → 9939.34] Yeah, the more you run around in there, the more you're going to toss the fog around, making it harder to see.
[9939.34 → 9940.98] Oh, it's, we're gone now.
[9941.32 → 9941.60] Yep.
[9941.76 → 9942.12] Wow.
[9942.18 → 9945.62] So that's like 15, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, maybe.
[9946.02 → 9947.38] It takes some time.
[9947.80 → 9951.38] It does take some time, but you must be, I mean, we've been robbed before.
[9951.50 → 9953.06] We know about how long it takes.
[9953.28 → 9955.92] It takes them a couple of minutes, no matter how fast they are.
[9955.94 → 9958.80] There's also going to be a moment of like, what the heck is happening?
[9958.82 → 9959.92] And that's a full warehouse.
[9960.40 → 9960.54] Yeah.
[9960.54 → 9964.08] It's not an indoor sort of eight foot ceiling, right?
[9964.20 → 9970.10] I saw one with a like a convenience store, um, that was like fast, like really fast.
[9970.76 → 9982.32] Um, I, I think like a, like a fog, if you could have like a, like a fog countermeasure with like a thermally equipped drone or something like that.
[9982.32 → 9985.84] Look, I, um, I'm going to be pro.
[9987.60 → 9987.96] Okay.
[9989.14 → 9990.76] I'm not going to get into the debate.
[9990.90 → 9993.66] I thought it was a drone with like a gun that shoots bullets.
[9993.66 → 9998.42] I'm not going to get into the debate, you know, in terms of like firearms culture in the U.S.
[9998.88 → 10000.60] That's you all's thing to figure out.
[10001.16 → 10003.08] Um, all I'll say is that.
[10003.08 → 10004.14] Nice usage of localized language.
[10004.14 → 10007.38] All I'll say is that things are what they are at the moment.
[10007.48 → 10018.68] There's clearly a, a mental health crisis and, um, and, and, and issues that are leading people to, to commit these heinous acts.
[10018.88 → 10019.08] Yeah.
[10019.26 → 10028.02] And if this drone deployment thing saves one kid, then it's worth it to me.
[10028.08 → 10028.72] A hundred percent.
[10028.92 → 10032.34] Do I think that this is something that could save one kid?
[10032.42 → 10032.98] Yeah, probably.
[10032.98 → 10040.16] I feel I, I'm much more interested in the non-lethal aspects and not because I'm like, oh my God, save the shooter.
[10040.30 → 10047.62] It's just shooting a rubber bullet or a beanbag at an active shooter.
[10048.02 → 10057.16] I feel like encourages them to go faster, not actually stops them personally.
[10057.40 → 10057.94] Right.
[10057.94 → 10066.90] Um, and I feel like a lot of the non-lethal options like the smoke or, um, I don't know if they're putting pepper spray in non-lethal or less lethal.
[10067.00 → 10068.66] I'm assuming they're putting it in non-lethal.
[10068.78 → 10069.62] I think it might've been a typo.
[10069.66 → 10070.62] It might be less than lethal.
[10073.18 → 10079.70] There are, whenever they include the less, there are versions where people are like definitely die.
[10079.70 → 10082.34] Cause if there are kids involved, it only takes one.
[10082.66 → 10084.52] Cause a high impact to a head is like.
[10084.72 → 10085.02] Right.
[10085.52 → 10086.54] It, things happen.
[10086.76 → 10089.58] Like people die in street fights with punches all the time.
[10089.66 → 10091.78] Now you're putting your, uh, projectile.
[10092.00 → 10093.74] Like it just, stuff happens.
[10094.02 → 10095.58] Uh, rubber bullets kill people.
[10095.82 → 10096.80] Like it's totally a thing.
[10096.86 → 10098.92] Uh, someone's talking about like tactical strobe lights.
[10099.14 → 10100.02] Like there's.
[10100.02 → 10101.42] Like things that can.
[10101.56 → 10102.32] I'd love to be.
[10102.50 → 10104.82] I like, that's a cool idea in a place that this does happen.
[10104.94 → 10110.16] Anything, anything disorienting that can slow them down is.
[10111.34 → 10117.32] As long as it doesn't have the potential side effect of permanently damaging a child.
[10117.86 → 10118.34] Um.
[10118.44 → 10118.68] Yeah.
[10118.70 → 10120.48] That's the part I'm worried about.
[10120.48 → 10121.86] It's worth a shot, man.
[10122.18 → 10122.40] Yeah.
[10122.66 → 10123.12] Do something.
[10123.22 → 10123.74] That seems cool.
[10123.74 → 10124.54] I, yeah.
[10124.64 → 10127.52] The, the, the general concept I'm actually not that against.
[10127.52 → 10137.20] Um, I don't like the idea of it being a flying gun controlled by a remote operator that might
[10137.20 → 10139.34] be difficult to stop.
[10139.50 → 10142.50] Uh, because then you could have the issues with the remote operators.
[10142.62 → 10142.96] Yep.
[10143.18 → 10143.58] I mean.
[10144.42 → 10147.24] And, and you also have like, I don't know.
[10147.24 → 10155.44] How is the how is the persistent on target of that flying gun?
[10155.44 → 10158.54] Um, I don't know.
[10158.74 → 10160.16] Just what, what is the chance that it misses?
[10160.42 → 10161.06] Hit somebody.
[10161.62 → 10163.38] Hit somebody that isn't the intended target.
[10165.92 → 10168.18] So, um, yeah.
[10168.82 → 10170.20] Again, good luck America.
[10173.68 → 10174.40] It's interesting.
[10174.98 → 10179.32] AMD let the cat out of the bag and now the cat won't go back in the bag.
[10179.62 → 10180.18] Imagine that.
[10180.24 → 10181.34] You ever tried to put a cat in a bag?
[10181.76 → 10181.96] Yeah.
[10181.96 → 10185.10] This makes sense this week.
[10185.18 → 10186.28] AMD released.
[10186.42 → 10187.22] Was it last week?
[10187.46 → 10193.80] At some point, AMD released the fidelity effects SDK 2.0, which, um, just happened to contain
[10193.80 → 10195.04] FSR four.
[10195.38 → 10198.48] And this may turn out to be an irrevocable mistake.
[10198.94 → 10201.10] Although they quickly took down the source code.
[10201.22 → 10206.74] Once something is released as open source under the MIT license, apparently it cannot be revoked.
[10206.74 → 10212.02] Users can legally use, modify, and even release their own forks of the project.
[10212.56 → 10218.70] And although every previous version of FSR was already open source, there had been no announcement made about FSR four.
[10219.12 → 10229.58] The leaked version of FSR four also included support for intake shaders, which means that they may be testing the currently locked to 9000 series feature on older cards.
[10230.92 → 10231.08] Sweet.
[10231.08 → 10234.44] Um, realistically AMD was probably going to be cool about this eventually.
[10234.44 → 10234.88] Yep.
[10234.94 → 10240.96] Um, and I'm actually, I'm actually, I'm a little annoyed on their behalf that it's, their hand is kind of being forced before they can.
[10241.18 → 10243.00] Especially because they are usually really cool about it.
[10243.00 → 10243.20] Yeah.
[10243.32 → 10246.14] If they weren't usually cool about it, I'd be like, ah, corporation.
[10246.74 → 10252.60] Um, and to be clear, AMD is not cool about everything, but this is something that they've been pretty cool about.
[10252.94 → 10256.46] Especially compared to competitors, they've been very nice to the open source.
[10256.60 → 10257.52] I kind of feel for them.
[10257.68 → 10258.58] I kind of feel for them.
[10258.62 → 10264.22] I'm, I'm down with them, but I'm also, um, I'm also down with just like new features being available to everybody for free.
[10264.22 → 10264.68] So that's cool.
[10265.22 → 10266.08] Good job, everyone.
[10266.08 → 10267.86] And hey, new features available.
[10268.52 → 10271.24] This, I thought was impossible.
[10272.48 → 10274.04] Framework announced this week.
[10274.14 → 10276.06] This is the topic that I was going to do, but I saved.
[10277.22 → 10285.08] Framework announced this week that you can now get the Framework Laptop 16 with the GeForce RTX 5070.
[10285.08 → 10288.10] And that is a pretty remarkable thing.
[10288.32 → 10290.36] You know what's more remarkable about it?
[10292.22 → 10308.24] You can also order the Framework Laptop 16 Investment Disclosure Graphics Module with the GeForce RTX 5070 and upgrade your laptop's graphics for exceptional gaming and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[10308.28 → 10309.20] Upgrade your lap.
[10309.48 → 10310.12] Are you going to do it?
[10310.12 → 10311.16] Yeah.
[10315.08 → 10318.64] What?
[10320.08 → 10320.86] Are you going to do it?
[10320.88 → 10321.34] They did it.
[10321.46 → 10322.00] Are you going to do it?
[10322.46 → 10325.32] Oh, I mean, I don't know about that, but they did it.
[10325.86 → 10326.54] It's sick.
[10326.74 → 10327.76] They did it.
[10327.76 → 10329.24] I have no idea how they pulled that off.
[10329.30 → 10329.88] They did it.
[10330.24 → 10331.60] Luke, they did it.
[10332.08 → 10335.40] Dude, companies, companies have been sued.
[10335.40 → 10344.92] Companies have lost millions of dollars in previous attempts to deliver an upgradable GPU freaking laptop.
[10345.68 → 10352.40] And not only did Framework do it, Framework did it with NVIDIA.
[10353.40 → 10359.86] Dude, do you know how long NVIDIA has been trying to kill laptop GPU modules?
[10359.86 → 10366.78] Every generation, they say we're not doing MXM anymore.
[10367.16 → 10367.72] Forget it.
[10368.22 → 10375.98] As rock's Desk Mini, those cute little desktops that had the CPU here, and then they had a little MXM slot so you could put a GPU on it.
[10375.98 → 10378.36] I have like a 1080 based one at home.
[10378.36 → 10382.34] Dead because of no support for MXM.
[10382.90 → 10387.82] Laptops with interchangeable what GPU you get in it where you can customize it before you buy it.
[10388.40 → 10389.40] On life support.
[10389.92 → 10395.54] Practically dead because NVIDIA doesn't want to support the standard as far as I can tell.
[10396.38 → 10397.20] Oh, who was it?
[10397.50 → 10402.56] Silverstone had this super cool GPU like Thunderbolt GPU that was going to use MXM.
[10402.64 → 10405.84] So it was going to be tiny and flipping freaking awesome.
[10405.84 → 10408.84] Killed because they couldn't get the support for MXM.
[10410.10 → 10411.60] How did they do this?
[10411.64 → 10412.38] I have no idea.
[10415.18 → 10416.60] This is crazy.
[10417.58 → 10418.64] It's pretty wild.
[10421.72 → 10422.72] Upgradable graphics.
[10423.56 → 10424.08] On a laptop.
[10424.18 → 10426.28] I mean, they've only got a couple options.
[10426.54 → 10428.26] Do you think it will continue?
[10428.40 → 10430.60] Do you think they're going to have a 60-70?
[10430.60 → 10433.96] Well, I would have told you no.
[10434.04 → 10434.72] It's impossible.
[10434.72 → 10436.28] Until now.
[10436.28 → 10439.36] Because one thing that worries me about this is, okay, cool.
[10439.52 → 10442.04] I can upgrade as in repair.
[10443.16 → 10444.42] Can I upgrade?
[10444.96 → 10446.88] Well, no, this is an upgrade from the original one.
[10446.90 → 10447.90] Will there be a 60-70?
[10448.36 → 10449.52] Is there a path forward?
[10450.02 → 10455.34] So what's cool about Framework's interface is it's just PCIe by 8.
[10456.14 → 10456.80] That's all it is.
[10457.18 → 10458.10] It's custom.
[10458.10 → 10459.66] I believe they...
[10459.66 → 10463.90] I don't know how open they made it, but fairly open.
[10465.42 → 10469.68] So I'm pretty sure just about anyone can make something that attaches to it.
[10469.72 → 10479.52] But they did have to create something scratch because there just didn't exist an interface that they could use for their geometry of the GPU installation anyway.
[10479.52 → 10487.18] So there's no technical reason why just about any GPU couldn't plug into it.
[10487.22 → 10491.34] And then the limit just becomes how big of a caboose you have on.
[10491.72 → 10494.08] How much room you need for thermals and...
[10495.08 → 10495.52] Yeah, yeah.
[10496.80 → 10497.00] Yeah.
[10497.08 → 10497.98] Well, yeah, for cooling.
[10497.98 → 10500.86] This is the second GPU, but it's not the second NVIDIA GPU, right?
[10500.86 → 10502.00] No, this is the first NVIDIA GPU.
[10502.04 → 10502.20] Yeah.
[10502.30 → 10508.26] So if you buy one with a 50-70 today, you're asking, will there be an upgrade path?
[10508.30 → 10508.46] Yeah.
[10511.32 → 10512.70] Before today, I'd have said no.
[10513.20 → 10515.46] Or I'd have said this is going to be difficult.
[10515.74 → 10515.92] Yeah.
[10516.04 → 10516.30] You know?
[10516.76 → 10519.86] But they've freaking done it, Luke.
[10520.20 → 10524.84] Do you know how many generations of laptop motherboards they've had for the Framework 13, too?
[10524.84 → 10530.02] Are they up to four now or something ridiculous like that?
[10530.12 → 10530.58] I'm not sure.
[10530.64 → 10533.12] Without fundamentally changing the chassis.
[10533.32 → 10537.86] You can have a Framework laptop of Theseus from back when they first launched it.
[10537.86 → 10538.38] I'm sure someone does.
[10538.48 → 10545.78] That has literally nothing left in it from back then and is just all new current gen parts.
[10546.52 → 10550.08] So if anyone can do it, it's Framework.
[10551.80 → 10553.80] So at this point, man...
[10553.80 → 10557.34] I think it's really cool in a business and negotiation standpoint.
[10558.00 → 10563.42] And I'm stoked for people that need NVIDIA GPUs for whatever they're doing, whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[10563.94 → 10572.32] At this point, I'm more interested in AMD stuff, potentially Intel stuffs as well,
[10572.32 → 10575.98] because I'm hoping to stick with Linux on my laptop.
[10575.98 → 10581.54] And the NVIDIA GPU in my current laptop is annoying to work around.
[10581.74 → 10584.72] It is the most annoying thing I've had to deal with so far.
[10584.72 → 10589.58] Is that when I do GPU stuff, it can be frustrating.
[10590.68 → 10591.52] That's about it.
[10591.76 → 10591.96] Dude.
[10592.98 → 10593.88] But this is wicked.
[10594.14 → 10594.98] This is very cool.
[10595.48 → 10596.96] I'm so excited for them.
[10596.98 → 10598.26] Most people are buying NVIDIA.
[10598.88 → 10599.66] It is what it is.
[10599.66 → 10600.16] It is what it is.
[10600.16 → 10600.98] Most people are buying NVIDIA.
[10601.06 → 10601.22] Yep.
[10601.22 → 10606.60] So now that's potentially bringing more people to repairable laptops, which is awesome.
[10606.94 → 10607.14] Yep.
[10608.54 → 10610.48] I just...
[10610.48 → 10611.22] Man, I...
[10612.06 → 10612.40] Oh.
[10612.94 → 10616.04] I don't think it'll be that easy right now.
[10616.04 → 10624.04] But if I could find my email to Iraq when I first found out that they were trying to do an upgradable laptop...
[10624.04 → 10628.30] Man.
[10629.58 → 10630.38] Iraq Gaming.
[10630.52 → 10630.86] I don't know.
[10630.94 → 10631.40] I'll try.
[10631.52 → 10633.80] But in the meantime, it's time to switch over to After Dark.
[10633.98 → 10634.36] This is...
[10634.36 → 10634.88] Sorry, one sec.
[10635.10 → 10640.06] This is for sure just supposed to be We Did It and then like a rocket ship and an exclamation mark.
[10640.50 → 10642.66] It really makes me think We Did It AI.
[10643.58 → 10643.86] Oh.
[10645.14 → 10645.72] Oh, yeah.
[10646.04 → 10646.86] I can see that.
[10648.24 → 10648.94] Maybe both.
[10649.46 → 10651.14] I mean, it's got an NVIDIA GPU in it.
[10651.18 → 10651.92] It probably does AI.
[10652.34 → 10652.64] Yeah.
[10661.38 → 10661.76] Dan?
[10663.02 → 10664.00] It's time for After Dark.
[10664.38 → 10664.66] Cool.
[10665.32 → 10666.04] Let's do that.
[10673.04 → 10674.42] Let's see if I can...
[10674.42 → 10676.14] See if I can find anything.
[10677.10 → 10677.54] Nice.
[10682.04 → 10684.24] Still fuzzing through things or...
[10684.24 → 10684.48] Oh, yeah.
[10684.48 → 10685.20] Shall I read you some?
[10685.22 → 10686.02] Yeah, you can read one.
[10686.24 → 10686.42] Sure.
[10686.42 → 10693.64] It's my birthday Monday, and I'm throwing together a video game Olympics for the second time.
[10694.16 → 10696.62] What are some good games that we should play?
[10696.74 → 10697.24] Nichols.
[10697.50 → 10698.22] Teams of two.
[10698.66 → 10698.94] Oh.
[10699.08 → 10699.48] Okay.
[10700.16 → 10700.88] Not that.
[10704.16 → 10705.30] Teams of two.
[10705.30 → 10711.36] That actually really narrows it down extremely.
[10711.56 → 10713.22] How many games are like 2v2?
[10714.56 → 10716.12] I guess you can play...
[10716.12 → 10716.20] I mean, there's Wingman.
[10717.12 → 10719.26] But like, you all have to be into FPS.
[10719.68 → 10720.28] So like...
[10720.28 → 10720.68] Yep.
[10721.22 → 10722.08] You can play some Rocket League.
[10722.08 → 10723.40] I'm surprised you whipped out the Wingman.
[10724.24 → 10726.06] Well, it's a 2v2 format, is it not?
[10726.08 → 10726.70] No, for sure.
[10726.92 → 10727.30] It's just...
[10728.30 → 10730.10] Have you ever played Wingman?
[10730.20 → 10731.08] I've played with you.
[10731.44 → 10731.62] Oh.
[10731.62 → 10733.44] Clearly it wasn't memorable, though.
[10733.54 → 10734.44] This is a long time ago.
[10735.64 → 10737.02] I've played a lot of wingmen.
[10738.12 → 10739.82] Yeah, I just...
[10739.82 → 10743.10] When you played it with me, it just wasn't satisfying, I guess.
[10746.82 → 10747.62] I get it.
[10748.72 → 10749.62] Oh, my bad.
[10749.76 → 10751.36] This is what no chicken does to a man.
[10753.60 → 10755.46] He had to eat a Subway sandwich today.
[10755.56 → 10755.76] Yeah!
[10755.76 → 10756.64] And I think he's still recovering.
[10756.84 → 10758.00] Honestly, I think I am.
[10758.46 → 10759.44] I'm very disappointed.
[10759.44 → 10763.28] We're a little bit too busy dealing with house stuff that I don't actually want to talk about
[10763.28 → 10765.68] instead of, you know, the cook.
[10767.76 → 10769.08] At least you found one game.
[10769.34 → 10770.44] That's probably good enough.
[10770.54 → 10772.54] People in the chat have brought up some cool stuff.
[10772.66 → 10775.08] Rocket League definitely supports 2v2 very effectively.
[10775.66 → 10778.74] Tape to tape, you could definitely 2v2 it, especially if you include some AI.
[10780.32 → 10782.78] You could theoretically 2v2 in League of Legends.
[10783.80 → 10786.42] You could 2v2 space cadet table.
[10786.78 → 10788.22] You each get one flipper.
[10789.44 → 10790.78] That would legitimately be fun.
[10790.96 → 10792.98] That would honestly be pretty legit, actually.
[10792.98 → 10793.60] That would be awesome.
[10793.60 → 10793.74] I think.
[10794.26 → 10794.96] You would enjoy it.
[10795.02 → 10795.52] You'd love it.
[10795.92 → 10799.64] Someone pointed out you could do 4 1v1s in Nichols.
[10800.76 → 10801.74] Do a little tourney.
[10802.40 → 10803.12] Oh, Left 4 Dead.
[10803.40 → 10804.20] Left 4 Dead with bots.
[10805.00 → 10805.60] Play co-op.
[10806.22 → 10807.06] Everyone has fun.
[10808.34 → 10810.88] Except the people who, you know...
[10810.88 → 10813.36] You're not shooting the smoker's tongue.
[10813.60 → 10815.60] You have to shoot the smoker's tongue.
[10815.64 → 10816.50] You have to break the tongue.
[10816.58 → 10817.60] I'm taking damage here.
[10817.68 → 10817.88] You know.
[10819.10 → 10821.30] I'm not a lot of fun to play Left 4 Dead with, I think.
[10821.44 → 10823.00] I think it's pretty fun, but I...
[10823.00 → 10823.78] Yeah.
[10823.78 → 10827.78] Gas Racing suggested Star Craft.
[10827.88 → 10828.06] Yeah.
[10828.22 → 10829.04] Yeah, you could pull...
[10829.04 → 10832.94] You know, it'd be kind of interesting to pull out an RTS that none of you have ever played
[10832.94 → 10834.92] and just wing it.
[10835.30 → 10835.72] What's that?
[10835.76 → 10836.76] There's a new...
[10836.76 → 10837.38] That'd be kind of cool.
[10837.84 → 10839.50] There's a new RTS coming, isn't there?
[10840.38 → 10842.90] You're not talking about that one from the ex-Blizzard folks.
[10843.02 → 10844.14] The Storm forge or whatever.
[10844.34 → 10844.36] No.
[10844.36 → 10846.74] That didn't seem to work out super well.
[10846.80 → 10848.30] Yeah, I think they're in trouble.
[10848.94 → 10849.66] Oh, really?
[10850.10 → 10850.44] Yeah.
[10850.66 → 10851.18] That sucks.
[10851.58 → 10852.40] Is that what it's called?
[10853.58 → 10854.68] Something along those lines.
[10855.38 → 10856.52] Tempest Rising?
[10862.02 → 10863.34] That's not the one I was talking about.
[10863.48 → 10864.02] Is it Storm gate?
[10866.94 → 10867.34] Storm gate?
[10872.08 → 10872.82] I don't know.
[10874.06 → 10874.50] My bad.
[10875.06 → 10875.52] Can't find it.
[10875.76 → 10876.16] Smash Bros?
[10876.24 → 10877.22] You could totally do Smash Bros.
[10877.22 → 10880.34] Double 2 Smash Bros is actually hello fun.
[10881.00 → 10881.40] Oh, boy.
[10881.66 → 10882.68] Apparently, yeah.
[10895.36 → 10896.88] So, I actually agree.
[10897.22 → 10901.36] The word scam is used in contexts that are, like, not good.
[10901.58 → 10902.94] I don't have a lot of...
[10902.94 → 10905.94] I don't have a lot of context for this drama, but...
[10905.94 → 10907.82] Yeah, words mean what they mean.
[10907.96 → 10908.34] Get good.
[10909.06 → 10911.44] Also, this is a bit of a problem, though.
[10913.86 → 10914.22] Ah.
[10915.38 → 10916.52] Did it get review bombed?
[10916.54 → 10917.18] That's possible.
[10917.34 → 10918.46] After you said stuff?
[10918.64 → 10919.74] Apparently in our language.
[10921.06 → 10921.44] Yeah.
[10921.94 → 10922.28] Yeah.
[10923.88 → 10925.50] Well, good luck with that.
[10925.50 → 10928.84] I have no idea what's going on with that game.
[10929.58 → 10929.98] Do you want some more?
[10930.90 → 10931.40] I do.
[10932.22 → 10933.16] Hello from Japan.
[10933.68 → 10938.52] I'm currently on the train heading back to the airport to catch my flight back to Canada.
[10939.00 → 10940.68] Have any of you also been here?
[10940.98 → 10943.12] Would love to hear your experience if you have.
[10943.62 → 10945.36] Luke and I went to Japan together once.
[10945.76 → 10946.00] Yeah.
[10947.82 → 10948.86] It was great, actually.
[10948.98 → 10949.50] It was a...
[10950.10 → 10950.88] Yeah, other than the...
[10950.88 → 10951.70] Really awesome trip.
[10951.70 → 10953.96] A little bit of light sexual harassment on your part, but okay.
[10955.80 → 10956.16] What?
[10956.30 → 10957.28] You tried to get me naked.
[10958.04 → 10958.70] Oh, I did.
[10959.42 → 10959.98] He did.
[10960.56 → 10961.34] I was naked.
[10961.92 → 10962.40] He was.
[10969.00 → 10970.60] I'm not much of a steam room guy.
[10971.42 → 10972.44] It wasn't a steam room.
[10972.58 → 10973.42] Or whatever it's called.
[10973.50 → 10973.84] The onset?
[10974.00 → 10974.18] Yeah.
[10974.18 → 10974.72] Yeah, onset.
[10975.30 → 10975.58] Yeah.
[10976.06 → 10977.10] I got too many tattoos.
[10978.92 → 10980.02] Yeah, I'm good to go.
[10980.60 → 10981.10] Oh, I know.
[10981.28 → 10982.00] I'm bare.
[10982.22 → 10985.12] Luke was a team sports kind of kid growing up.
[10985.36 → 10989.92] I never really did the let's all just whip it out in the locker room thing, and I'm honestly
[10989.92 → 10990.76] not that into it.
[10991.30 → 10997.18] I'm not particularly, like, into it, but I was in Japan and wanted to do Japanese things.
[10997.24 → 10997.92] You did it right.
[10998.16 → 10998.84] You did it right.
[10998.84 → 11004.04] And I got to hang out with one of the engineers from Common, who we were just with, and it was
[11004.04 → 11004.82] actually super chill.
[11005.00 → 11005.14] Yeah.
[11005.58 → 11006.32] I believe you.
[11006.60 → 11006.84] Yeah.
[11007.10 → 11007.50] It was cool.
[11007.94 → 11008.20] Yep.
[11008.72 → 11009.66] Well, actually, it was quite warm.
[11010.04 → 11010.40] Yeah, yeah.
[11010.64 → 11011.28] That makes sense.
[11011.52 → 11011.72] Yeah.
[11011.94 → 11012.94] In spite of the nudity.
[11013.16 → 11013.42] Mm-hmm.
[11013.56 → 11014.56] You might even say it was hot.
[11015.54 → 11015.86] Mm-hmm.
[11018.44 → 11019.58] I don't have any tattoos.
[11022.42 → 11024.44] I could have believed it either way, to be honest.
[11024.46 → 11027.34] I mean, I was going for, like, the Yakuza vibe.
[11027.78 → 11028.26] Yeah, no.
[11028.26 → 11030.82] No one has ever seen my giant full back.
[11032.36 → 11033.48] Like, tiger?
[11033.72 → 11034.08] Tiger.
[11034.08 → 11036.72] Tiger, you know, eating a rooster kind of thing.
[11036.82 → 11037.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11038.44 → 11038.80] Linus.
[11039.24 → 11039.98] In all capitals.
[11040.10 → 11040.28] Mm-hmm.
[11040.38 → 11042.70] What was your favourite tech growing up?
[11043.38 → 11044.44] Gaming computers.
[11045.54 → 11045.94] Wow.
[11045.94 → 11048.36] I mean, I really liked my Disc man.
[11049.80 → 11050.86] Disc man were sweet.
[11050.86 → 11052.24] That was a game changer, dude.
[11052.32 → 11053.62] I mean, oh, man.
[11055.16 → 11057.80] Having to, like, hold the rewind button.
[11057.96 → 11061.62] I'm the kind of person who gets hooked on a song, and I just, like, I want to hear that
[11061.62 → 11062.62] song over and over again.
[11062.62 → 11065.62] Especially when I was younger.
[11065.90 → 11070.88] So, I'd have to, like, get good at memorizing how long I have to hold the rewind button in
[11070.88 → 11074.38] order to get back to the point where the song starts on my Walkman.
[11074.90 → 11079.80] And so, dude, upgrading to a disc, that was an absolute life changer for me.
[11079.88 → 11082.40] I started being able to burn my own mix CDs and stuff.
[11082.40 → 11082.62] Oh, yeah.
[11082.68 → 11083.10] Oh.
[11083.68 → 11084.02] Yeah.
[11084.02 → 11084.68] So good.
[11085.10 → 11085.42] Yeah.
[11085.42 → 11088.06] So, oh, man, that's tough.
[11088.14 → 11091.76] But then I couldn't make a mix CD without my gaming PC.
[11093.16 → 11094.52] It wasn't really a gaming PC at that point.
[11094.52 → 11095.68] It all comes back to the computer.
[11095.80 → 11098.38] But it had a CD burner, so that was, you know, pretty good.
[11099.46 → 11101.12] Ooh, I had a really slow CD burner.
[11101.94 → 11105.98] But still, I could set it to go at night, and then I could get up in the morning, and sometimes
[11105.98 → 11107.26] it wouldn't be a coaster.
[11108.16 → 11109.58] Those were exciting mornings.
[11112.14 → 11113.34] God, our tech sucked.
[11113.34 → 11123.10] I remember we had Net Nanny, and I used to play RuneScape back in, I'm assuming this
[11123.10 → 11124.48] was like 2002 or something.
[11125.92 → 11129.72] And I would load up RuneScape, and it would take so long to load.
[11129.78 → 11133.82] It would successfully load, which is actually fascinating to me at this point.
[11134.20 → 11134.50] Right.
[11134.86 → 11135.54] The fact that it...
[11135.54 → 11139.14] So many things today would time out before even trying for that long.
[11139.14 → 11139.78] Something would go wrong.
[11139.78 → 11139.94] Yeah.
[11139.94 → 11141.14] But it would successfully load.
[11141.14 → 11148.34] But I would go downstairs and make a sandwich and a drink and consume both, and then come
[11148.34 → 11150.40] back upstairs, and then it would finish loading.
[11150.40 → 11153.32] And you guys have no idea how long it takes him to eat a sandwich.
[11153.70 → 11157.78] It's remarkable he manages to consume enough calories to maintain his size.
[11157.88 → 11158.22] Yeah.
[11158.92 → 11159.88] It's an effort.
[11159.88 → 11163.20] I had just gotten my new braces.
[11166.14 → 11168.34] And we sat down together at the table.
[11168.58 → 11170.46] I actually gave him his burger first.
[11170.64 → 11172.48] So he had started eating already.
[11172.60 → 11173.54] I had just gotten them.
[11173.58 → 11176.86] I still had the bite turbos and like the bite blocks at the back.
[11176.92 → 11182.16] So I couldn't even close my molars to within like about this distance.
[11182.16 → 11185.44] Because I still finished my burger before he did.
[11185.94 → 11189.76] In all that pain, without being able to close my molars.
[11191.12 → 11193.00] How is it even possible, Luke?
[11199.46 → 11200.12] Anyway, yeah.
[11200.20 → 11201.88] That was a heck of a thing.
[11201.88 → 11204.74] I don't remember why I brought that up.
[11204.82 → 11206.26] But yeah, that's...
[11206.26 → 11207.72] And I did that like all the time.
[11210.34 → 11210.74] Anyway.
[11211.60 → 11212.24] Luke Newcomb.
[11212.90 → 11214.30] Which battlefield was your favourite?
[11214.56 → 11215.30] Quality reference.
[11215.54 → 11217.88] I put way too many hours in 1942.
[11219.22 → 11221.32] Also, so glad the super soft is back.
[11221.60 → 11223.52] Ruined my last one, frying burgers.
[11223.78 → 11224.40] Oh, okay.
[11225.18 → 11226.88] What is it the fashion team told me?
[11227.04 → 11230.64] I think it's like dish soap and baking soda and pre-treated and then wash it.
[11230.64 → 11232.24] You should be able to get grease stains out of it.
[11232.34 → 11232.76] It's a thing.
[11233.28 → 11233.90] Anyway, carry on.
[11235.12 → 11237.22] 1942 was incredible.
[11238.64 → 11245.48] I think the most condensed fun, if that's a term that I can use that people will understand,
[11245.80 → 11247.44] that I had was Bad Company 2.
[11250.78 → 11252.30] Wasn't 1942 the first one?
[11254.38 → 11255.26] That would make sense.
[11255.48 → 11256.20] I'm trying to remember.
[11256.94 → 11257.58] Anyway, carry on.
[11257.72 → 11260.46] And then I think it had a few expansions and stuff that kept it going for a while.
[11260.64 → 11262.44] 1942, I feel like, was pretty long-lasting.
[11264.94 → 11269.96] But honestly, the one, and this might just because like the friends that I had to play
[11269.96 → 11274.08] with at the time and stuff, but Battlefield 3 hit pretty hard for me.
[11274.74 → 11276.30] I think I'd go with Battlefield 3.
[11277.76 → 11278.92] 1942 was incredible.
[11278.92 → 11283.42] But I think Battlefield 3 got the most like enjoyment.
[11283.64 → 11287.66] But again, it might have been because of the social aspect that was coming along with it.
[11291.62 → 11295.12] 1942's Wake Island was such an experience, James said in Flow plane chat.
[11295.38 → 11297.68] And that made me think, this was my whole pain.
[11298.10 → 11302.60] Honestly, Wake Island specifically was my whole pain with the new maps in Battlefield 6
[11302.60 → 11303.92] and knowing how small they are.
[11303.92 → 11311.42] Because Wake Island, like really, it felt like a campaign of this crazy push-pull.
[11312.36 → 11316.86] And the new maps are like, there's one kind of mountain in the middle
[11316.86 → 11319.36] and you just kind of fight in a ring around it.
[11319.38 → 11320.80] And that's like one of the biggest maps they have.
[11321.00 → 11322.06] It's like, hold on.
[11322.40 → 11323.62] Remember how bad games looked?
[11323.72 → 11325.10] Remember how...
[11325.10 → 11326.78] Do you remember that that's what that looked?
[11326.78 → 11326.94] I'm completely okay with it.
[11326.94 → 11327.96] Oh yeah, I do.
[11328.22 → 11329.90] I don't have the...
[11329.90 → 11332.54] Like when people are like, oh, Borrowing looks so bad.
[11332.66 → 11335.68] You for sure remember it differently than it looks.
[11335.76 → 11336.86] Then I see a screenshot of Borrowing.
[11336.92 → 11338.98] I'm like, that's exactly how I remember it looking.
[11340.46 → 11341.36] Sounds good.
[11342.10 → 11343.00] This helicopter.
[11343.12 → 11343.44] What is it?
[11343.44 → 11344.22] A cyber truck?
[11344.34 → 11345.10] Sick, dude.
[11345.42 → 11345.86] Wow.
[11346.22 → 11346.44] Heck yeah.
[11347.14 → 11352.12] Dude, when I see screenshots of like 1.6,
[11352.66 → 11355.44] I really want to play the game.
[11355.58 → 11356.24] As is.
[11356.24 → 11357.40] I don't want it to look better.
[11357.60 → 11358.84] I want it to look like that.
[11358.96 → 11361.68] I want grenades to just be bricks that fly through the air.
[11362.04 → 11362.24] I just...
[11362.92 → 11364.34] Dude, that's awesome.
[11364.54 → 11365.24] Why not?
[11365.44 → 11366.18] Yeah, why not?
[11366.68 → 11367.78] Screw graphics, man.
[11367.96 → 11368.42] Who needs them?
[11368.54 → 11369.48] Give me good games again.
[11369.90 → 11370.62] Who needs them?
[11373.82 → 11374.24] Linus!
[11375.42 → 11377.84] Can you buy the Canucks so that they stop sucking?
[11378.40 → 11380.18] It's quality texture right here.
[11381.02 → 11382.02] It's green.
[11383.04 → 11383.92] Sorry, what is it?
[11383.92 → 11386.08] Can you buy the Canucks so that they stop sucking?
[11386.54 → 11387.38] Oh, you're not talking to me.
[11387.40 → 11387.72] I'm sorry.
[11387.84 → 11388.66] No, I can't see this.
[11389.00 → 11389.22] Oh.
[11389.46 → 11389.76] Oh.
[11390.96 → 11391.36] Fine.
[11391.36 → 11391.68] Sorry.
[11392.04 → 11392.44] Fine.
[11393.14 → 11394.54] Can I buy the Canucks?
[11394.60 → 11395.78] What are you even talking about?
[11396.46 → 11396.98] I have...
[11396.98 → 11398.96] A, I have no idea how to run a sports team.
[11399.32 → 11401.64] B, oh my God, with what money?
[11402.10 → 11403.74] The coach doesn't seem to either, I guess.
[11403.74 → 11405.50] Wow.
[11406.36 → 11406.72] Mean.
[11406.92 → 11407.52] Boot roasted.
[11407.92 → 11408.32] Mean.
[11408.46 → 11409.18] You play tape-to-tape.
[11409.22 → 11410.48] You probably know enough about him.
[11410.72 → 11411.08] Hacky.
[11411.46 → 11412.40] Yeah, for sure.
[11412.56 → 11412.96] Hacky.
[11414.20 → 11414.60] Nope.
[11415.16 → 11417.80] I have no ideas to make the Canucks stop sucking.
[11417.94 → 11420.26] At this point, I might as well just cheer for the oil.
[11420.72 → 11423.12] Hope they can get McDaid signed and make another push.
[11424.00 → 11424.84] Let's go, boys.
[11425.80 → 11426.96] And the last one I got for you today.
[11427.34 → 11432.10] Hey, Linus, now that you've been the chief vision officer for a while, is it a position
[11432.10 → 11438.08] you think could work at any other company or is also being the CEO's boss an integral
[11438.08 → 11438.62] component?
[11438.62 → 11448.00] Yeah, I think that it basically is the CEO's job to have the vision for the company normally,
[11448.32 → 11456.04] but because our structure, where I'm also the primary shareholder, and I mostly just needed
[11456.04 → 11462.48] to offload all the other aspects of what the CEO does, it did make sense to break those
[11462.48 → 11463.08] things out.
[11464.80 → 11467.16] It's not something I'd really recommend.
[11467.16 → 11468.68] Like, you wouldn't want...
[11468.68 → 11475.26] The only reason that my role works is because, in addition to my title, I also just carry
[11475.26 → 11480.30] pretty heavy sort of soft power, is the way Taryn first described it to me when I was
[11480.30 → 11485.04] bewildered at some point about why people were listening to me about something.
[11485.52 → 11491.14] And he was like, well, you can't just make comments flippantly, because you've got to
[11491.14 → 11496.10] understand that whether you say to do something or don't say to do something, when you say stuff,
[11496.10 → 11497.78] people...
[11497.78 → 11499.30] It's high-priority actioned.
[11499.94 → 11500.58] People...
[11500.58 → 11501.56] Automatically, every time.
[11501.62 → 11506.24] Sometimes, even if I tell people not to, which I'm not actually referring to you, Dan,
[11506.36 → 11506.96] believe it or not.
[11507.96 → 11512.74] There was someone else I ran into recently where I explicitly said...
[11512.74 → 11514.14] I asked a question.
[11514.22 → 11514.78] Yeah, that's right.
[11514.96 → 11516.80] I asked a question to someone in accounting.
[11516.90 → 11518.90] I was like, hey, do you happen to know this?
[11519.20 → 11521.22] And they were like, no, I'd have to look that up.
[11521.22 → 11522.94] And I said, that's too much work.
[11523.12 → 11523.82] Don't do it.
[11524.50 → 11525.28] And I left.
[11525.48 → 11527.04] But now you've ear wormed them.
[11527.14 → 11534.24] And they came back to me, like, 40 minutes later, having created this wonderful summary
[11534.24 → 11534.98] of what I asked.
[11534.98 → 11544.60] And I said, okay, so I know your mother-in-law will operate in this fashion where they say,
[11544.76 → 11548.94] you know, oh, gosh, it'd sure be nice if the temperature was a little higher in here.
[11548.94 → 11549.92] But no, no trouble.
[11550.00 → 11551.24] Don't get up and turn it up.
[11551.82 → 11553.10] That is not how I work.
[11553.10 → 11558.96] If I explicitly say, do not do something, I consider any further action on doing that
[11558.96 → 11562.24] thing a complete and utter waste of time not to be done.
[11562.94 → 11569.12] I think something that you struggle to get, though, is that if someone did that to you
[11569.12 → 11573.32] and it was interesting enough to you, you wouldn't be able to stop but doing it.
[11574.12 → 11575.30] Oh, I don't know.
[11575.36 → 11575.96] Do you have an example?
[11576.18 → 11577.16] I don't think so.
[11577.30 → 11578.50] I think you're going to have to give me an example.
[11578.78 → 11579.26] This is a suspicion.
[11579.62 → 11580.20] Oh, okay.
[11580.48 → 11580.82] Okay.
[11580.82 → 11584.02] If you catch me in it, though, you got to nail me on it.
[11584.02 → 11585.14] You got to bring it to WAN Show.
[11585.16 → 11586.38] For sure, don't have an example.
[11586.40 → 11587.48] Don't even tell me at the time.
[11587.50 → 11588.50] And I can't think of one.
[11588.62 → 11590.42] Catch me on it and bring it to WAN Show.
[11590.48 → 11590.90] I'll try.
[11591.06 → 11591.50] We'll see.
[11591.74 → 11592.12] I'm ready.
[11592.12 → 11596.40] The problem is you would have to be sufficiently interested in the thing.
[11598.68 → 11599.78] Yeah, this wasn't interesting.
[11599.78 → 11600.34] It's not just anything.
[11600.48 → 11600.82] Oh, okay.
[11600.86 → 11602.38] Yeah, it wasn't an interesting thing I asked.
[11602.52 → 11602.66] Got it.
[11602.74 → 11602.84] Okay.
[11602.84 → 11604.18] Yeah, I was just curious.
[11604.30 → 11606.72] It was for like a throwaway joke in a video or something.
[11606.88 → 11609.28] I was just like, if I said this, would it be true?
[11610.08 → 11611.66] And so I was doing a quick fact check.
[11611.80 → 11614.50] And then it was more than three seconds of work.
[11614.86 → 11617.24] And so I was like, this is not worth it.
[11617.26 → 11618.42] I will write a different joke.
[11618.54 → 11618.82] Got it.
[11618.82 → 11619.28] I get that.
[11620.08 → 11627.04] What I'm trying to describe is like if someone serves you the like most interesting looking
[11627.04 → 11633.10] thing of your day, but then it can't necessarily like turn into something more valuable and
[11633.10 → 11634.48] you're like, oh, I can do whatever.
[11634.68 → 11635.82] And they're like, oh, never mind.
[11636.44 → 11636.96] It's fine.
[11637.70 → 11640.44] I think you'd be very tempted to follow through to that anyway.
[11640.88 → 11641.24] Maybe.
[11641.42 → 11644.10] But that's a specific scenario and is not what you're just describing.
[11644.36 → 11646.40] Tim says, okay, I've got to ask.
[11646.82 → 11649.86] I know you have ADHD, but do you have autism?
[11649.86 → 11652.68] Because I have autism and that kind of direct.
[11652.88 → 11653.30] No, really.
[11653.40 → 11657.62] I mean, the exact thing I say is only something I see with other people with autism.
[11658.06 → 11659.64] I'm not diagnosed.
[11661.46 → 11664.44] It's clearly not super severe.
[11664.44 → 11672.02] However, I have more than one family member somewhere on the spectrum, like actually diagnosed.
[11672.70 → 11679.28] And my whole clan is a little spectrum.
[11680.22 → 11686.36] And I mean that in the kindest, fuzziest possible way.
[11686.36 → 11695.06] Um, I definitely do experience things that other people, um, with autism report experiencing.
[11695.06 → 11700.10] I will, I'll do things like when I'm walking, I'll accidentally kind of brush my foot on the
[11700.10 → 11701.52] ground in a particular way.
[11701.52 → 11703.04] And then I'll have like, have to do it again.
[11703.04 → 11705.16] Otherwise I can't like to cancel it out.
[11705.16 → 11708.12] Like there's, there's weird sensory stuff like that.
[11708.12 → 11711.42] Um, but clearly it's not a hindrance.
[11711.42 → 11715.24] So there's never been really any need to get a formal diagnosis.
[11716.36 → 11720.48] Uh, Oxfam says undiagnosed, but what else could it be?
[11720.56 → 11721.24] Yeah, pretty much.
[11721.96 → 11722.32] Um, yeah.
[11722.46 → 11728.12] Spectrum is, is my word that I like to use to describe it, says Shrank, because it can
[11728.12 → 11728.86] never be wrong.
[11730.08 → 11733.12] Literally everyone all the way from zero to one.
[11733.26 → 11739.36] I think sometimes we care too much about giving ourselves special little, which is the
[11739.36 → 11742.30] kind of literal Pokémon elements, literal label.
[11742.50 → 11745.82] I'm a, I'm a fire wind type.
[11745.82 → 11747.48] Fire flying type.
[11747.80 → 11751.58] Spectrum is the kind of literal label that someone spectrum would apply.
[11751.86 → 11752.10] Yeah.
[11752.72 → 11753.88] It's technically true.
[11754.18 → 11754.64] Nice.
[11756.48 → 11759.30] But I, yeah, I, I don't know.
[11759.44 → 11765.18] I, I, I can't care too much about it.
[11765.96 → 11766.22] Yeah.
[11766.94 → 11767.28] Yeah.
[11767.28 → 11774.40] You first.
[11775.06 → 11775.54] Oh, right.
[11775.84 → 11776.74] We'll see you again next week.
[11777.42 → 11778.30] Same bad time.
[11778.40 → 11779.26] Same bad channel folks.
[11779.40 → 11779.78] Bye.
[11785.94 → 11786.98] No, you hang up.
[11787.26 → 11788.28] No, you hang up.
[11788.28 → 11801.62] No, you hang up.
