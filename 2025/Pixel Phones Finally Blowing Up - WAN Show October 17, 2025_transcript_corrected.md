[0.00 → 13.12] happy Friday everyone and oh welcome to the wan show we've got a great show lined up for you
[13.12 → 26.12] guys this week do we thought it'll be fine Capcom apparently doesn't see the value in bringing back
[26.12 → 31.08] their original games uh that's telling no, no okay there is more to it than that it's not it
[31.08 → 39.10] no, no no yeah it's not like it's not like that also the pixel 10 pro folds has gotten a little
[39.10 → 45.58] spicy going up in smoke I think smoke is actually a charitable way of describing it during jerry
[45.58 → 50.74] rig everything's bend test what else we got going on this week did Phillips abandon us
[50.74 → 56.10] phillips he tried to pitch this for the title topic for the entire wan show are you
[56.10 → 62.94] that are you that interested in what else is there Phillips like the light bulb and shaver
[62.94 → 67.82] company I'm not caring about their old games just like almost every other game studio
[67.82 → 74.00] okay what else we got I don't know you want to talk about it's got to be this log for the
[74.00 → 85.04] fourth time no it's got to be this one uh oh yeah sure ChatGPT uh loses its darn mind if you ask it
[85.04 → 88.68] about a seahorse emoji it's pretty funny it is pretty funny
[88.68 → 114.92] the show is brought to you today by rove lab AMD MSI green man gaming of course alongside our rap
[114.92 → 117.68] partner d-run our laptop partner dell and our chair partner
[117.68 → 127.76] ball Turkish I'm pretty sure that's how you pronounce it yeah yep oh they're both upside down
[127.76 → 135.68] now yep nice solid secret lab that that that's the one why don't we jump right into
[135.68 → 143.68] our headline topic today which is of course the pixel 10 pro folds causing the first major phone
[143.68 → 150.48] blowing up controversy since oh man what was it the Samsung Galaxy note 7 way back in the day
[150.48 → 155.88] although in fairness to oh you're doing that already no, no don't do that now do that later
[155.88 → 161.92] do that later do that later okay, okay okay during Zach from jerry rig everything's durability
[161.92 → 168.72] testing of the pixel 10 pro fold he was able to break the phone close to the hinge with his hands
[168.72 → 177.20] I mean okay in fairness to the pixel 10 pro fold have you seen that man's arms
[177.20 → 185.22] yeah yeah yeah I mean if I didn't know that he was a tech YouTuber I would think he was like
[185.22 → 191.80] a gym bro there's a few workout YouTuber jacked tech YouTubers these days yeah I know yeah I don't
[191.80 → 198.08] really get it I well actually I think I do get it you know how every time you're going through like a
[198.08 → 206.84] bit of a health kick you say to yourself okay I've got an idea every time I die in game or every time i
[206.84 → 212.00] you're saying we're all terrible at game fail and overclock right I'm going to do I'm going to do five
[212.00 → 218.02] push-ups are you the best at games then I think that what are you because I'm in great shape no, no
[218.02 → 225.76] no what I think is I think those like jacked geeks and nerds are the ones who actually have the
[225.76 → 231.72] discipline to do it because every time I've ever come up with that idea I've done it like once and
[231.72 → 237.54] then I'll like I'll like to die and I'll be like oh yeah but like I'll be like I'm responding in like
[237.54 → 242.38] five seconds I'll just and then i just completely don't do it you need an additional layer of
[242.38 → 247.66] discipline which is to play a game that actually works for it yeah oh dude and like it's its one
[247.66 → 254.12] of those catch-22s right because if I had the discipline to be disciplined enough to work out
[254.12 → 259.40] while I'm gaming I wouldn't need that discipline because I would already have the discipline to just
[259.40 → 270.56] work outcome on it's the same kind of discipline to force yourself to not do the thing you want to
[270.56 → 274.68] do so you can eat your vegetables you know so you can do the thing you know you're supposed to be
[274.68 → 278.08] doing I think it's a little different you think it's different I think it's a little different
[278.08 → 285.06] location changing is a heck of a thing um I think it's honestly for me, it's playing the game that
[285.06 → 291.94] accommodates that better for me every game accommodates that no I'm pretty bad at video
[291.94 → 295.54] games what if you're playing like okay you bring up counterstrike all the time what if you're
[295.54 → 300.16] playing counterstrike, but it's like oh dude I could do dude, but it's like free-for-all I would
[300.16 → 305.42] my well yeah but still you're just gonna instant spawn no, no you'll, you'll still have match in
[305.42 → 311.02] between matches and stuff that's it takes a little while you have to some of them I don't think and you
[311.02 → 315.34] gotta see everybody's beautiful gun skin standing on their little podium and everything at the end
[315.34 → 319.18] of the round I'm not talking about matchmaking I'm talking about like server browser free-for-all
[319.18 → 325.26] oh I'm okay sure but even then when there's a map change I think there's like a winner thing
[325.26 → 327.98] not very common then you should do really fast push-ups
[327.98 → 336.12] I don't think that's a valid excuse uh there are definitely games where there isn't enough time
[336.12 → 345.00] between anyway after repeated bends the battery apparently became so compromised that it went up
[345.00 → 354.60] in smoke, and we've got a very uh very brief marvel television ad one moment please do anybody
[354.60 → 365.48] care anymore no well yes but yeah okay uh that's all I'm going to show you have to go watch because you're
[365.48 → 371.72] going to have to go watch the video on his channel yeah, yeah great video love Zach does great work um
[372.92 → 379.00] wow this is the first phone that has failed in this way during Zach's durability testing
[379.56 → 386.60] I fix it's Elizabeth chamberlain told the verge though as dramatic as the battery fire is we don't
[386.60 → 392.20] think this is necessarily a sign that something is wrong with the pixel 10 pro fold design and something
[392.20 → 397.72] that some random person on Reddit I don't have the citation here because it's not in my notes
[397.72 → 405.56] also noticed that was that the phone was seemingly fully charged when Zach performed his bend test and
[405.56 → 412.52] the amount of charge the charge state of the battery uh impacts directly how much energy is stored in it
[412.52 → 420.68] and therefore what the risk of catastrophic failure could be um until i i would i would tend to
[420.68 → 429.56] agree until we start seeing more of these uh more of these failures in the wild I wouldn't necessarily go
[429.56 → 433.80] yeah that's why you shouldn't buy a pixel 10 pro fold um
[433.80 → 442.20] um I would say there are plenty of other reasons not to buy a pixel 10 pro fold it's just it's gotten
[442.20 → 449.48] it's gotten ridiculous Luke it's too expensive and to be clear this applies equally to Samsung's
[449.48 → 455.24] folding devices like we're talking about by the time you know we account for currency conversion but
[455.24 → 460.20] even in us dollars we're talking about devices that by the time you know pay sales tax on them
[460.20 → 465.88] they're getting dangerously close to a couple of thousand us dollars I mean you know for us, we're
[465.88 → 473.56] talking well over 2500 Canadian dollars for a phone like when did this happen with the folds mostly
[474.52 → 479.96] I mean phone prices have been creeping slightly but I honestly don't think for a while there was a
[481.32 → 485.24] it feels like there was a relatively big jump a while ago and since then they've been
[486.12 → 491.16] relatively flat I think that big jump from my perspective though might have been pixels trying
[491.16 → 497.16] to catch up with apple pricing so I know there were news articles coming out talking about how
[497.16 → 503.64] uh google was perceiving that their phones were valued as lower than iPhones because the price was lower
[505.48 → 510.20] so they actually raised the price for like marketing reasons also because it's nice to raise your price but
[510.20 → 514.68] like yeah part of it was legitimately being like no look we want to be in the same category
[515.72 → 524.36] I don't know if that's the entire problem google i i I think the problem is one man okay this is an
[524.36 → 531.80] interesting conversation how would you fix google's branding and positioning issue and to be clear I'm
[531.80 → 539.48] not saying that it's a universal problem like what's android's market share in like India it's like 90 or
[539.48 → 545.00] something like that I don't know that that number is quite right, but it's like extremely one-sided in
[545.00 → 555.40] certain markets towards android but specifically in the US for younger us buyers apple is dominant like
[555.40 → 564.36] absolutely completely dominant and not because the price is higher the price is higher so that apple can be
[564.36 → 570.44] very profitable on all the iPhones that they sell to young Americans um the reason that they're able to
[570.44 → 576.84] command this pricing is because of the brand association that quite frankly google just doesn't have
[576.84 → 585.56] google doesn't have a sexy brand and because of the way that apple locks in their users through their
[585.56 → 593.88] social lives, and you know not just in ways that you and I would kind of mock um where people will be
[593.88 → 600.20] socially ostracized for not having an iPhone because that's the dumbest thing ever um but in ways that
[600.20 → 606.20] are even more effective than that like it's not just the colour of the bubble it's the fact that
[606.20 → 611.08] you know if you're the one person who doesn't have an iPhone then your group chats you know won't work
[611.08 → 617.48] properly or whatever else and theoretically that is you know addressed through RCS but I don't know what
[617.48 → 623.00] your experience has been like with RCS mine's been a little bit inconsistent um, and it fails over to
[623.72 → 633.72] classic SMS or mm son not a frequent basis but on a sometimes basis on a more than I don't have a
[633.72 → 641.48] data connection right now basis so it's just not quite if it's not quite there the vast majority of
[641.48 → 648.52] people I talk to these days converse over discord to the point where like I know an entire company that
[648.52 → 655.40] I work with closely often works entirely through discord um all of their employees talk through
[655.40 → 662.36] discord a lot of the creators that I'll talk to you for full plane or whatever else like to converse
[662.36 → 667.72] through discord more than anything else well the thing is that discord is multi-platform that's always
[667.72 → 672.20] been my issue with that's what I'm kind of saying is like I don't actually run into this very often
[672.20 → 677.40] right because not a ton of people that I talk to use texting you're not a teenage American boy
[677.40 → 682.20] it's weird that they're going back to texting i I look I don't I don't get it either because to me
[682.84 → 690.12] the simple fact that an app is not multi-platform makes it utterly irrelevant because I won't always be
[690.12 → 697.08] on that platform, and it makes sense that in your social circle the platform of choice would be
[697.08 → 702.12] discord because basically any gamer would have that exact same problem you're not going to be on your
[702.12 → 707.56] macBook or your iPad or your iPhone while you're playing video games a lot of these people are
[707.56 → 715.08] professionals with like their photo is like them in business attire and their name is like their first
[715.08 → 721.48] name and then the business that they work for okay but are they gamers I don't know to be honest oh okay
[721.48 → 728.44] that's fair enough like actually genuinely don't know maybe that's fair enough but i I guess what
[728.44 → 733.88] I'm trying to say is okay I definitely see it for the gamer demographic but even if you just have to
[733.88 → 740.04] use a windows' laptop for work then yeah fine it's like automatically the second you have to use any
[740.04 → 747.88] device that is not a mac or an i something then you just it you just you can't just have all of your
[747.88 → 754.60] correspondences sequestered onto one ecosystem of devices if you ever have to touch another ecosystem
[754.60 → 760.36] Nepal is using it for voting for their country's leader, and they're using it for coordinating discord
[760.36 → 763.56] yeah, and they were using it for coordinating their like uh
[765.88 → 775.08] uprising is that the right term hopefully oh yeah I mean discord was the primary thing used there
[775.08 → 782.92] wow but like what I'm what I'm wondering if I'm detecting is if android nerds use discord
[785.88 → 792.92] it's like what's the most popular type of phone in Nepal I mean it's not America so android probably
[793.48 → 801.56] that's what I'm assuming yeah I don't know that you will that's great uh plod in float plane chat says
[801.56 → 810.92] you mean literal discord yes yeah uh wow an AI overview guess I just won't read that yeah that's
[810.92 → 815.56] my new thing I don't even know if it's new maybe I've even talked about it before but I'm trying to
[815.56 → 821.08] have the discipline to not even read them nice i I know you can disable them I know you can disable them
[821.08 → 828.68] my general approach to using services operating systems uh devices is that I try to leave things
[828.68 → 834.28] pretty close to default because I'm trying to have the default user experience for the most part
[834.92 → 841.88] so I have left them enabled, but that doesn't mean that I can't discipline myself to not read them
[841.88 → 847.24] but I want to know how google search is generally working for most people as just a professional
[847.24 → 855.16] curiosity sorry what were we looking at there uh apple was 25 percent okay so Xiaomi is 21 and a
[855.16 → 861.72] half Samsung is 20, and then it's real me vivo unknown right all the rest yeah yeah yeah
[861.72 → 862.28] makes sense
[865.40 → 873.40] so that's it a pixel 10 pro fold blew up um honestly I think the bigger issue is just pricing and I have
[873.40 → 881.48] no idea how this gets fixed because I mean apple keeps being rumoured to be working on a folding phone
[881.48 → 886.12] as well and I could see apple moving into folding phones pushing them into the mainstream more
[886.68 → 892.04] increasing the volumes of these screens that need to be produced and therefore making
[892.04 → 896.84] them overall more affordable for everyone like i could see that being something that could
[897.88 → 904.60] cause them to become more affordable and more mainstream but while one of the theories out there is
[904.60 → 913.16] that the iPhone air is kind of a first attempt at moving to uh like a thinner phone design so that
[913.16 → 919.32] apple can eventually make a folding device I just don't really know if uh I just don't really know if
[919.32 → 930.04] I see it happening anytime soon like it's been rumoured for so long, and it's been very clear what the issues with
[930.04 → 936.68] folding devices are, and those issues are not going away and all of that's been going on for so long
[936.68 → 942.92] that I just don't really see the light at the end of the tunnel like the issues are clearly around
[942.92 → 951.08] durability hinge quality um scratch resistance of the screen like you've got you've got on the very
[951.08 → 956.76] very high end of android you've got these folding devices that you can, you know almost scratch with a
[956.76 → 963.08] fingernail at a point, and then you've got apple that's shipping devices that have screens that are
[963.08 → 969.56] so flipping hard that you know Zach oh also Zach from jerry rig everything had to kind of change his
[969.56 → 976.60] his little spiel about you know lightly scratches and they moved a whole we moved a whole level up on
[976.60 → 981.72] most scale of hardness which is yeah pretty darn cool yeah so are they going to give up those gains
[981.72 → 990.36] for what so that they can sell fewer iPads also a lot of people that I know that have folding phones
[990.36 → 997.48] end up just using the like skinny main screen well when you're typing its better like i daily the
[997.48 → 1001.08] fold three for ages typing its better a lot of times you just need to respond to something quickly
[1001.08 → 1004.28] and then put your phone away yep so you don't want to unfold it and go through this whole process you
[1004.28 → 1009.40] just want to answer quickly but I mean but the big screen I mean it's its great for work, and it's
[1009.40 → 1016.28] great for remote desktop it's great for content consumption it's great for reading which also
[1016.28 → 1021.80] content consumption but I think content consumption has sort of a connotation of like um videos video
[1021.80 → 1029.56] yeah or maybe games I would say gaming probably doesn't fall under category I'd say that's its own
[1029.56 → 1035.24] because you don't consume a game you interact with a game you know
[1035.24 → 1041.96] he's having to think there's no there are arguments that you interact with a video as well he's
[1041.96 → 1045.48] having to think there are arguments that you interact with do you though yeah are they interacting with
[1045.48 → 1049.40] this video right now okay well we're live that's different the players we're live that's different
[1049.40 → 1053.32] you might chat but watching a live stream is definitely content consumption
[1053.32 → 1065.24] oh for sure I want to move on this is making me uncomfortable uh Capcom doesn't see the value
[1065.64 → 1072.04] in bringing back their original games uh last year Capcom released the original versions of the first
[1072.04 → 1079.16] three resident evils on pc, but apparently it took some real convincing from the folks at good old games
[1079.16 → 1087.40] per Gog's uh I'm not even going to try I'm going to butcher his name so sorry about that per Gog
[1087.96 → 1095.72] Capcom said we have all these remakes they're they're already a superior experience to those original games
[1096.76 → 1104.04] so they really didn't see the value in bringing back the vanilla versions um Gog says that the re-releases
[1104.04 → 1110.92] have been a success though and have proved Gog's argument that gamers want the originals was correct
[1111.64 → 1117.08] so our discussion question here is do you think it's important to preserve the original versions of old games
[1117.08 → 1125.40] on modern platforms even after modern remasters or remakes are released I do think so I think so too
[1125.40 → 1132.04] why yeah i I think sometimes people say like oh nostalgia glasses rose-tinted glasses whatever i
[1132.04 → 1138.60] sometimes think you do accurately remember what it was like and those graphics due to the nostalgia maybe
[1138.60 → 1142.92] or whatever else I don't know you might find those graphics charming for whatever reason I just want to
[1142.92 → 1149.40] play it how it was, and it's about more than just graphics I mean back when i I didn't I wasn't on top
[1149.40 → 1158.92] of it so I didn't do it but when uh blizzard kind of removed uh their older uh warcraft titles from Gog
[1159.56 → 1165.24] because you know well reforged is like you know better now or whatever i I had really I didn't
[1165.24 → 1171.40] really want to give Activision blizzard any money but I really wanted to own those original versions of
[1171.40 → 1177.88] those games and I didn't have my old CD keys or anything, and so I was like i I'm very tempted to pick
[1177.88 → 1183.96] up copies of these before I can't get them anymore because I don't necessarily want your fixed balance
[1183.96 → 1190.28] yeah I don't necessarily want your enhanced experiences and in the case of like in the case
[1190.28 → 1195.88] of single player experiences for instance maybe you want to play the old buggy version and mess around
[1195.88 → 1199.80] with speed running maybe you want the controls to be clunky because that's more like what it was
[1200.44 → 1206.28] yeah yeah or that's another perfect point and the reason that I actually picked this as a
[1206.28 → 1216.12] Sancho topic this week is that I'm about 30 hours into playing a remake of a beloved game for me
[1216.12 → 1221.56] from that I played when I was much younger uh Final Fantasy tactics, so the remake is called the Evelyn
[1221.56 → 1231.64] chronicles, and they have improved a lot like the modern nice to haves like when you're in a fight now
[1231.64 → 1239.00] you can just go back to the world map and you won't end up like there was a
[1239.00 → 1247.16] particularly notorious fight in this game where you are you have to win a battle, and then you go into
[1247.80 → 1254.20] another battle like subsequently without being able to go back to the world map and like redo all your
[1254.20 → 1258.68] uh all your equipment or like grind a few more levels whatever it is you might feel like you need to
[1258.68 → 1264.60] do you go straight into the second fight, and you have to 1v1 a really powerful opponent who has
[1264.60 → 1270.28] initiative on you and like if you didn't build your main character which you would have no way of
[1270.28 → 1278.60] knowing to do around winning this fight you could end up essentially with a no progression state uh if you
[1278.60 → 1285.80] didn't happen to save early enough to go back and grind up and learn useful abilities for this fight
[1285.80 → 1293.48] Final Fantasy 6 had a few moments like that so you know the new version of tactics has very much
[1293.48 → 1299.48] nice to have modern creature comforts that allow you to back out of that fight at that point you
[1299.48 → 1304.92] obviously lose any XP or items that you gained during this progression but no matter what it's got
[1304.92 → 1311.64] auto save which is nice you can just go back out and go do some stuff um but what I noticed is that some
[1311.64 → 1321.32] of the modern niceties have actually taken away from the game they've made it, so there's certain content
[1321.32 → 1329.64] that you can just skip you can just not bother with so one of the things that they added that
[1330.60 → 1337.64] I've definitely felt was really nice is the ability to flee from random battles so it used to be that as
[1337.64 → 1342.68] you were moving around on the world map every time you passed over a certain location anything but
[1342.68 → 1347.96] anything but a city uh you could hit a random battle because it's Final Fantasy that's sort of
[1347.96 → 1354.36] that's part of the game that's sort of a core element of Final Fantasy is the annoyance and frustration
[1354.36 → 1362.20] and the grind of random battles and so being able to skip them is great because when you go to the towns
[1362.20 → 1368.20] and you go to the tavern there are these missions that you can send your party members off on and
[1368.20 → 1374.52] they'll come back with uh job points so they'll like level up their job abilities um which is like your
[1374.52 → 1381.64] class yeah they'll get gold um so you some of them can be extremely lucrative, and then you'll, you'll also
[1381.64 → 1387.16] find like random relics or whatever so you can become a treasure hunter it doesn't really have any benefit but
[1387.16 → 1393.32] it plays a nice you know dopamine releasing music and your characters jump around and get excited
[1393.32 → 1399.88] about it so whatever sure great um but the way that you do these is you go to the town and then you
[1399.88 → 1408.20] assign a few of your few of your random party members to go off on this mission and then every dot
[1408.20 → 1414.92] that you go over on the map is one day and the mission lasts for usually anywhere from like nine to
[1414.92 → 1421.96] 14 days or kind of somewhere in that range, so the whole idea of this mechanic was that you had to
[1421.96 → 1429.96] build up a whole roster of party members besides just your main five that you take into every fight
[1429.96 → 1436.44] because they're your best ones, and they only become more better the more that you use them because
[1436.44 → 1441.88] they'll continue to level up and level up and level up um so you had to maintain a larger roster so that
[1441.88 → 1447.16] you had guys to send on these missions and so that you could survive the random fights that you would
[1447.16 → 1453.40] go through before you could come get your guys back with all their booty right well now you can
[1453.40 → 1459.48] just move around on the map for a little bit flee from all the fights and then just collect the golden
[1459.48 → 1465.48] job points so you didn't you didn't earn it that's why I mentioned my thing about controls um is like in
[1466.20 → 1470.60] say the original star craft you could only select a certain amount of units if I remember correctly
[1471.08 → 1477.96] in one drag select and then I don't remember but was there bindable groups uh I'm trying to remember
[1477.96 → 1484.52] like shift one yeah yeah star craft warcraft 3 definitely had it three yeah I don't remember if
[1484.52 → 1493.16] star craft had it uh the mcg says yes star craft had it I don't think there was like different forms of
[1493.16 → 1498.92] it or something, but either way there's like there's like mirroring shortcuts that kind of come in
[1498.92 → 1507.16] later versions right which are a difficulty changer a hundred percent so like having those old controls
[1507.16 → 1515.96] might feel worse sure, but it might make the game easier right oh yeah which is like so basically the
[1515.96 → 1519.88] thing that you're saying, but it's its slightly different is through the control route, but it's like
[1519.88 → 1525.56] oh I've got one that's very similar sure so another really nice to have is that in final
[1525.56 → 1531.56] fantasy tactics the original when you moved on the battlefield it would say are you sure, and you'd be
[1531.56 → 1539.40] like yes you're moved it's like chess rules once you let go of the piece it's there it doesn't matter
[1539.40 → 1546.92] if you immediately go oh my god no, no oh no it doesn't matter you're there um and one of the things that
[1546.92 → 1558.28] made that really challenging was that depending on my zodiac sing and your zodiac sign and my specific
[1558.28 → 1565.16] characters attributes and yours I could do dramatically different damage with the same attack to one
[1565.16 → 1572.04] opponent versus another one but once I moved I couldn't know how much until I moved within range
[1572.04 → 1579.08] and made and like lined up attack information, and then it would, and then it would predict you know how much
[1579.08 → 1585.08] damage I'm going to do got it and that can be really important in a tactics game because a difference of 10
[1585.08 → 1589.88] percent in my damage dealing could be the difference between a KO and
[1590.52 → 1595.48] overextending myself and completely turning the tide of the fight yeah so in the remake
[1595.48 → 1603.16] you can just you can just shop around for the best move so you can just move there and go okay how much
[1603.16 → 1608.76] damage can I do to that guy um no I okay now move there and then see how much damage I can do there and
[1608.76 → 1613.56] then I can undo my move and I can do that as many times as I want unless I have a certain ability equipped
[1613.56 → 1621.48] that is like a move find item or a move um gain job points or like something like that like
[1621.48 → 1625.96] there are certain abilities that that lock your ability to unmoved that makes sense, but it makes it
[1627.00 → 1636.84] markedly easier um and the only way that they sort of countered all of this but was by adding
[1636.84 → 1642.12] a more difficult mode they added a tactician difficulty, but they took the laziest possible
[1642.12 → 1648.68] approach to increasing difficulty where instead of enhancing the enemy AI for instance like it still
[1648.68 → 1655.96] does shockingly stupid stuff uh they just nerfed my damage and buffed theirs yeah I hate
[1655.96 → 1663.32] that I hate just like number go up difficulty yeah stuff I mean to a certain degree sure but I think
[1663.32 → 1669.16] one of the most egregious modern examples of that is the oblivion remake where there's like two
[1669.16 → 1672.92] difficulty levels I don't remember what they are I'm sure chat will know um they've been on a thing
[1672.92 → 1680.84] today um where you jump up, and it like doubles or triples the enemy hp like it's its just a wild
[1680.84 → 1684.76] experience you play on one setting it's like wow this is way too easy you play on the other setting
[1684.76 → 1690.36] it's like okay it feels like I'm playing wall yeah and i just have to stab this yeah adept to expert
[1690.36 → 1697.16] sure i don't know you just have to stab things like i don't know you go from like one-shotting
[1697.16 → 1702.44] things to fights take three minutes like it makes no sense at all, and they recognized it pretty quick
[1702.44 → 1709.32] and i think they said that they were going to change it but yikes i mean fights and i mean i didn't I
[1709.32 → 1715.64] only played the original oblivion but i know that i do remember some fights just being a grind to the
[1715.64 → 1720.04] point where it's almost like immersion breaking oh yeah, and then you have to because then it takes
[1720.04 → 1723.96] so long that you take a bunch of damage now you have to run and heal for a while so that adds to the
[1723.96 → 1729.32] total time and then well i just mean it at a certain point it doesn't matter how tough you are
[1729.32 → 1738.92] if you're made of flesh and I'm holding a big giant metal sharp thing sure there's only so many times
[1738.92 → 1744.20] and like you know the animation has blood coming off of you like it's just there were these um the
[1744.20 → 1752.04] original far cry had these horrible like big brutes that show up towards the later stages of the game
[1752.04 → 1758.36] and i remember somehow take more bullets i remember being stuck in this one point that was just
[1758.36 → 1765.56] incredibly frustrating because you had to kind of time it perfectly to get like it was like multiple
[1765.56 → 1773.80] rockets you have to hit these stupid things with and I'm just like no, no matter what you are no matter
[1773.80 → 1787.00] how tough you are if you are made of flesh and blood and bones a rocket blows you up like I'm no, no bullets
[1787.00 → 1793.00] fine you know you could be shot a few times, and you could still be just like you know
[1793.00 → 1798.76] messed up enough to keep moving towards me or something like i can I i can handle there are some
[1798.76 → 1805.48] examples suspension of disbelief yeah around that, or you know you could be you could have a few arrows
[1805.48 → 1809.88] in you, and you could like to rip it off and like come after me or whatever like sure you could have a
[1809.88 → 1815.32] grenade you know go off next to you, and it blows off your arm or whatever, but you still like you know
[1815.32 → 1819.64] you're not you're a zombie or something you stagger towards me, and you like to grab onto me, i can get
[1819.64 → 1825.80] behind any of that close the odd artery while it blew your arm off a rocket launcher to the face like i
[1825.80 → 1831.00] still it's like one of those ancient memories because i could have been no older than like when
[1831.00 → 1838.60] did far cry come out like i was like 16 or something right like it but i still remember it even
[1838.60 → 1846.20] though that was yeah exactly even though that was uh 21 years ago because i was just so mad because i
[1846.20 → 1851.00] died on this section a bunch of times i finally came up with an idea i was like okay i have like i have
[1851.00 → 1857.88] one rocket and then i got my shot off like perfectly i hit him in the face with it and I'm like okay
[1857.88 → 1865.24] surely that must have killed and I'm dead, and it's just like that's not fun, and you can limit
[1865.24 → 1870.92] the difficulty in other ways you can make you could make a rocket really hard to aim you know you make
[1870.92 → 1877.48] the crosshair move sure you could severely restrict the ammo because it was already an issue in that game
[1877.48 → 1882.20] where you couldn't just like carry an unlimited number of weapons and stuff you so you could limit
[1882.20 → 1886.84] the number of weapons that i can carry i can only carry two weapons and so and i can only carry two
[1886.84 → 1892.52] rockets yeah so taking the rocket laundry is like a huge ammo risk yeah just just just this huge there's
[1892.52 → 1897.88] huge downsides to it or whatever fine you know like find another way to fix the balance but be more
[1897.88 → 1906.12] creative than just hp go up hp go up yeah it's not fun yeah unless you're the kind of person who just
[1906.12 → 1912.68] really enjoys that in which case we want to hear from you, I'm kidding i don't yeah i was like uh
[1912.68 → 1920.52] no it's its lazy no it's lazy design it's lazy design what are we talking about what topic are we on
[1920.52 → 1927.40] um Capcom not seeing the value right yeah i think having original versions is cool
[1927.96 → 1935.16] for sure uh our discussion topic here from Mr Gough goutier is why are some devs averse to
[1935.16 → 1940.92] re-releasing older games without touching them too much are they being lazy are they being cheap
[1941.48 → 1947.32] um are they scared the original is so Jacky it could scare off potential buyers that one i think
[1947.32 → 1954.28] i could see that one i think that's the main one i think if you're releasing this game on Gog i think
[1954.28 → 1959.48] you're safe from that i think so too i mean that's that's what i think, but you never know i mean brands
[1959.48 → 1964.12] are funny about their brands because when you launch that game it's still going to be a big giant
[1964.12 → 1969.32] Capcom when you launch it and so if they're kind of sitting there going well i mean yeah we were pretty
[1969.32 → 1977.24] proud of that 25 years ago but the games' industry has sort of moved on and i i could see people
[1977.24 → 1982.92] you know creating a negative association between our brand and this like frustrating Jacky experience i
[1982.92 → 1993.40] i I've heard I've heard dumber arguments around brand use yeah for sure i just think uh they also
[1993.40 → 1997.40] need to understand the positive association that would come with doing this and doing this the right
[1997.40 → 2003.48] way which i think is releasing it through Gog i think they did do it the right way that positive
[2003.48 → 2009.16] association is to a completely different person though the positive association is with the nostalgia
[2009.16 → 2014.60] crowd or with the diehards who just you love the franchise, and they want to go experience it the
[2014.60 → 2020.52] way that it was or something like that whereas if almost literally anyone else ended up with this
[2020.52 → 2025.08] game there's a really solid chance they wouldn't like it like i wouldn't have given my son original
[2025.08 → 2033.16] Final Fantasy tactics because it like didn't explain anything you just kind of get dumped into it, you've
[2033.16 → 2038.92] no idea what to do it's super frustrating manual game was that like a yeah so like unless you have
[2039.16 → 2044.36] i mean you could like maybe find a PDF and print off a replacement or something but unless you have the
[2044.36 → 2052.60] manual it's not the same experience i think that's like surprisingly easy to forget it's like experiencing
[2052.60 → 2054.28] something from that long ago now
[2057.16 → 2064.28] is difficult to truly make the same because you kind of need everything that came with experiencing
[2064.28 → 2072.36] that to experience it properly good old vims layer Final Fantasy tactics manual that's awesome actually
[2072.36 → 2072.92] here it is
[2077.72 → 2087.64] oh it's really slow cool that makes sense i wonder if a few people looked it up yep nice that's cool
[2087.64 → 2097.08] oh man manuals were pretty cool dude okay, okay but like okay look at this look at this though like
[2097.08 → 2105.80] this is crazy in the new version they explain the importance of picking your zodiac sign like they
[2105.80 → 2114.12] they explain it quite a bit here enter the adventure i don't know Brut just go for it after entering your
[2114.12 → 2118.12] character's name enter your birthdate on the next screen in similar fashion using the start button to
[2118.12 → 2123.48] confirm your birthdate will affect zodiac sign which has an influence on your character's performance
[2123.48 → 2128.36] during battles see page 10, but they're just like yeah just yeah go for it well what's on page 10 all
[2128.36 → 2134.20] right if it has a full matrix then i will be then I'll think it's okay
[2134.20 → 2146.12] uh yeah is this not page 10 because this looks like 10 10 but i don't think we've scrolled enough
[2146.12 → 2148.92] times for it to be page 10 uh
[2152.28 → 2160.68] yeah no not that useful cool the vim thing says you're on page like seven now or something
[2160.68 → 2169.08] yeah we can three chat saying three, but the corner said 10 yeah well cool chat saying three let's try
[2169.08 → 2175.24] three let's try three I'm going to hear you out chat nope that's definitely not it all right i don't know
[2175.24 → 2181.72] what they mean by three neat how are they both missing three anyway the point is i have literally no idea
[2181.72 → 2189.32] what they're saying no it's a j as in jack i have actually no idea what they're saying j not three
[2189.32 → 2197.48] what does j mean j as in j oh like section j on page 10. oh, oh oh okay here here
[2200.04 → 2205.40] yeah okay this symbol indicates the unit's zodiac sign if the unit attacks an enemy with
[2205.40 → 2210.84] a compatible sign damage will be increased uh if signs are incompatible damage is decreased press
[2210.84 → 2214.60] the select button during battle to bring up a help menu and check the zodiac sign compatibility okay
[2214.60 → 2223.32] okay you know what that that's actually pretty okay I will say though that this is a flipping
[2224.52 → 2234.04] this is dense this is not user-friendly this is not for kids and this is just in some cases
[2234.04 → 2239.16] indicating where to go to bring up a help menu built within the game that is also
[2239.96 → 2244.60] not got the greatest translation you liked it is it not for kids or is it not for kids now
[2245.24 → 2248.76] I don't know and I don't know how I liked it i really
[2250.68 → 2254.76] like I'm thinking back to some of my first experiences playing this game like I didn't
[2254.76 → 2260.28] I didn't know how to change your I didn't even know how to learn ever is borrowing I didn't know it had a
[2260.28 → 2267.32] main quest yeah for months okay this is my borrowing yeah like I ended up against a brick wall in this game
[2267.32 → 2272.84] because I didn't actually twice within the first few battles because I didn't know how to learn
[2272.84 → 2278.60] additional abilities and I didn't know how to because I didn't have the manual actually I played
[2278.60 → 2283.00] it is on an emulator for the first time so that's a big part of the reason that I bought this was
[2283.00 → 2287.88] because I like needed to give square soft square Unix now but I needed to give the money for it at
[2287.88 → 2294.84] some point because I'd already played the game a few times um so I didn't have a manual so I didn't
[2294.84 → 2299.40] know that you could like to learn new abilities, and so I just got really frustrated because I kept coming
[2299.40 → 2303.96] up against tougher and tougher enemies that had all these like amazing abilities, and they could do
[2303.96 → 2312.20] magic and I'm like okay so when do I level up and then I didn't figure out changing jobs for a
[2312.20 → 2317.72] while either so I don't know how I figured out how to play this game to be honest with you because it's
[2317.72 → 2326.12] very deep very complicated I think sometimes that's what you want as a kid you think so you
[2326.12 → 2336.44] want to fight with something and like force learn it and impart your will onto it despite it being
[2336.44 → 2342.28] complicated and hard maybe part of it is just like having time at that stage in your life yeah you have
[2342.28 → 2348.52] tons of time you have all the time you need a good Iowa in float plane chat says I played com
[2348.52 → 2353.40] apocalypse when I was eight and finished it I went back to it a few years ago I have no idea how I did
[2353.40 → 2363.88] that yeah, but you have almost no responsibilities tons of time and yeah a desire to pick things apart
[2363.88 → 2370.44] and learn things that is like almost unparalleled I really didn't realize when I was in it how much
[2370.44 → 2375.88] free time I had when I was a kid like I felt like I did a lot of chores and honestly
[2377.80 → 2384.04] I did a fair amount of chores and stuff, but it's it's like the mental load I was never thinking
[2384.04 → 2391.72] about that stuff when I had my free time when I had my free time my brain completely switched over
[2392.44 → 2397.32] and I was free I remember thinking when I was a kid at one point in time that I was really excited to be
[2397.32 → 2404.52] an adult because then I wouldn't have homework therefore more time yeah homework is just practiced
[2404.52 → 2416.12] for working at home and like at an at and I fully understand that in a lot of work positions you can
[2416.12 → 2423.08] turn off being at work when you are not at work anymore I will say that once you are at you know
[2423.08 → 2434.92] director VP executive c-suite level most people I know they just effectively are working all the time
[2434.92 → 2441.64] yeah no it just doesn't like that no that's that's not how it works um yeah and ninja man away says yeah
[2441.64 → 2447.64] not in teaching lol yeah there's so there's lots of there's lots of jobs where um you do get kind of
[2447.64 → 2455.96] like the summer in teaching yes so I mean it depends um that's also fair not with your current
[2455.96 → 2460.36] wages because now you got to do summer school or some other job coming from a family of teachers i
[2460.36 → 2467.40] definitely have some thoughts on how educators compensation has scaled over my lifetime and
[2467.96 → 2475.08] I definitely know some educators with families who definitely do not have summers off because not
[2475.08 → 2480.04] because they have to teach at school but because they have to find some other job you know uh teach
[2480.04 → 2489.80] badminton classes or do something else so that's a whole separate conversation especially when we consider
[2489.80 → 2498.52] the importance of teachers role in society yeah um you should want them being pretty good you should
[2498.52 → 2507.40] really want them to be like awesome um especially when you consider how many things a teacher needs to
[2507.40 → 2513.40] be awesome at like they've got to teach yes well, and you never know when you're getting like side
[2513.40 → 2519.08] swiped by some random question about something that isn't your field they need to be you know counsellors
[2519.08 → 2526.60] sometimes they need to be often suspect mediators sometimes they're expected to be these like jack of all
[2526.60 → 2531.08] trades especially in elementary school they're expected to teach like every subject they have to be you
[2531.08 → 2537.40] know somewhat athletic so they can like to teach pe, but also they need to know math and English and
[2537.40 → 2540.12] everything else and yeah
[2543.48 → 2551.80] yeah uh next topic sure Dan what do you want us to do because that's two main topics I mean we can move
[2551.80 → 2559.08] over to some CW announcements if Dan you just tell us what to do I mean do we have a lot of topics
[2561.64 → 2566.28] yeah why not let's do the CW he's having a thing this is the man that is truly in charge
[2568.12 → 2576.04] yep he said CW in essence oh right i yeah uh he commanded I don't know where to find them jump in the
[2576.04 → 2579.88] middle I don't know where to find them in the middle Dan I don't know how to do this show the
[2579.88 → 2583.48] middle they're at the very top yeah they're at the top Dan oh because there's no main topics yeah
[2583.48 → 2589.56] we don't have main topics this week they're at the top CW announcements note oh my god what
[2590.12 → 2595.32] chad is making me very tired today no you just seem exhausted today are you cranky you seem
[2595.32 → 2603.88] cranky and tired you've said that every week for so long well maybe you should especially this week
[2603.88 → 2611.56] maybe you should sleep a little more and eat a bit more my goodness are you very tired today I am
[2611.56 → 2618.92] a little tired my wrist is like demolished oh from your project have you talked to them about
[2618.92 → 2624.20] that I'm trying to remember super extensively okay it's a little bit but do you want to talk about
[2624.20 → 2628.04] that you don't have to not particularly I don't think it's that interesting I mean it just kind of
[2628.04 → 2633.40] sucks its kind of interesting I think it's interesting i why don't you tell the people
[2633.40 → 2642.76] about it okay um so my place uh as with basically every place you're going to get most likely uh was
[2642.76 → 2648.36] purchased off of someone else in my situation that person passed away so it was an estate sale
[2648.84 → 2655.24] um the estate was dissolved shortly after the sale, so there's nothing for us to go after but there was a
[2655.24 → 2663.16] bunch of undisclosed damage um that we learned through the strata uh I have been told that for
[2663.16 → 2669.88] Americans that's the homeowners' association uh HOA yep I don't know if that's true for apartments still
[2669.88 → 2674.04] or whatever I don't know I think it's kind of the same idea sure people generally know what a HOA is
[2674.04 → 2680.12] yeah we call it a stratum it's that thing but for an apartment building or a condo building um I was
[2680.12 → 2685.88] informed through that that my unit had a bunch of leaks in it with the previous owner we thought
[2685.88 → 2692.20] that that was centralized to one location and that it was dealt with a while ago because we dealt with
[2692.20 → 2700.12] it a while ago turns out it was not because there was more than one set of leaks that happened we solved
[2700.12 → 2705.24] the one set of leaks that happened turns out there was a second set of leaks what about
[2705.24 → 2711.16] second we're pretty sure because they did tell us this much they told us to not use the dishwasher
[2711.16 → 2716.52] when we moved in because the seal was not good yeah we're pretty sure that they learned the seal was
[2716.52 → 2723.88] not good by it flooding the house nice, and they didn't say that part um so how our unit works I'm
[2723.88 → 2729.00] going to use some I'm going to do some perfect paint this is going to be amazing this is great uh
[2729.00 → 2736.68] jay fife in float plane chat goes has aka the league of extraordinary Karens yeah it's crazy dude
[2736.68 → 2743.64] I wanted uh so we have a mini split in my unit so that's an air conditioner yeah and I wanted to have
[2744.28 → 2753.88] a second head so a second fan thing that makes it cold yeah sure uh, and basically we wanted two rooms to
[2753.88 → 2761.80] be a seed instead of just one room uh, and we were told no right because the unit that goes outside
[2761.80 → 2765.80] did you say it doesn't know oh you just switch back that makes sense the unit that goes outside
[2765.80 → 2775.32] is mounted like in a certain spot go away internet um, and it would have had to move for reasons and been
[2775.32 → 2781.64] somewhere else and I demonstrated with art like decent art actually really how I would have made it like
[2781.64 → 2788.44] this no oh okay I'm just checking not bothersome to the other people right right, right um and they
[2788.44 → 2796.04] still were just like nope no one else has done it and or can do it so you can't do it, so my problem is
[2796.04 → 2806.20] that it feels like it feels like we have man this is going way off the rails now but I feel like
[2806.20 → 2816.84] we have a bit of a societal problem right now where saying no is easy yeah and problem-solving is hard
[2818.20 → 2826.20] but saying no sucks and solving problem problem-solving means that you have solved a problem
[2826.84 → 2833.96] and i just I feel like somehow and I've gone through this so I've gone through so much bureaucracy
[2833.96 → 2842.28] in the last 13 years running a business you just come up against bureaucracy as just part of
[2842.28 → 2853.56] your daily life and i i i I think that it has been the single most aging tiring
[2855.64 → 2862.68] just life draining part of being alive for the last 13 years it's like dealing with other annoying
[2862.68 → 2869.80] people well it's not it's not even that they're annoying right because they're not it annoyed they're not
[2871.40 → 2880.92] sure, but they're not trying to be annoying they just it's its through incompetence or laziness or apathy
[2881.64 → 2889.64] um sometimes stupidity they don't actually understand the question and then that that stupidity plus apathy is a
[2889.64 → 2895.88] really potent combination in a bureaucrat because they don't understand, and they don't really care
[2895.88 → 2906.36] to understand um which is just it's a brick wall and uh and i just i it it's its at the point now
[2906.36 → 2911.72] where it's such an obstacle to getting anything done I mean look at how long it took us to get whale land
[2911.72 → 2919.24] done and that was with a lot of support, and so i I want to take a moment to shout out the city of surrey
[2919.24 → 2929.08] actually because of the people there that were very helpful and helped us overcome the apathetic lazy
[2930.20 → 2939.00] sometimes seemingly malicious individuals that stood in the way um because it was fine to do whale land
[2939.00 → 2944.52] and we did a whale land the video is coming, and it was great, and it was fun it was awesome, and it was a
[2944.52 → 2950.44] boon to the city so even with the mayor on board and the council on board and thinking this is a good idea
[2951.08 → 2962.28] just the amount of bureaucratic obstruction that could be put in place by sometimes just one person
[2962.28 → 2967.72] from project to project right like you never know when bam it's going to hit you and someone just
[2968.84 → 2976.04] had a bad day one day and said no and is a principled person who once they've decided something
[2977.16 → 2985.40] expects that that's just the decision now, and it's like no is not going to work here like we need a
[2985.40 → 2989.88] solution, and you can either be part of the solution or you're an obstacle those are it's its kind of
[2989.88 → 2999.48] binary here um anyway what I'm trying to say is that's horrible, and it's like it's not the end of
[2999.48 → 3004.60] the world okay so what Luke can't have two heads on his mini split he's not going to die it's not that
[3004.60 → 3011.40] kind of horrible, but it's just it's draining I mean it drains your life force there 's is a problem
[3011.40 → 3016.28] in my unit where yeah the building that we're in and I'll say this bit because I know other buildings
[3016.28 → 3021.32] have this problem it's in bc I think it's bc law I could be wrong I don't know you're not allowed to
[3021.32 → 3028.92] smoke within a certain amount of feet of buildings yeah but because air quality etc our building has
[3028.92 → 3036.76] allowed smoking on your like balcony thing right so genuinely if we have any window open if the sliding
[3036.76 → 3045.88] doors open anything for any amount of time like I mean at four in the morning it doesn't matter any time
[3046.28 → 3052.36] just I don't know if it's how like things are shaped or what but like all of it seems to flow
[3052.36 → 3058.68] directly into our unit it's crazy I was gonna I was gonna this is I was going to the bathroom yesterday
[3058.68 → 3064.76] and I yelled out to Emma being like I feel like I'm literally smoking weed right now because like
[3064.76 → 3070.52] there was so moat so much secondhand smoke coming into our unit so that's why you're so sleepy maybe
[3070.52 → 3075.88] maybe you're just still actually maybe I'm still high yeah no I don't think so but I was going to do the
[3075.88 → 3083.80] the way I'm sure but then I got high I didn't mean to but then I got high um yeah I know it's its
[3083.80 → 3091.64] it's terrible so we don't want like I even tried I built this like insulated box thing I don't know
[3091.64 → 3098.04] if you've even seen it but maybe uh rock wall inside a wooden long tall wooden vertical box
[3098.04 → 3104.28] that I put in the sliding glass door that you can even move the latch from the wall to this box you
[3104.28 → 3110.68] can latch the door on it and then feed through an ac tube for like a rollable ac thing it still leaks
[3110.68 → 3114.84] a little bit too much you can get smoke in the house and I won't die from it, I'll be fine the
[3114.84 → 3119.96] birds will yep so it's like ah so we want another mini split one of the greatest things about this
[3119.96 → 3124.52] whole thing is one of the key people that was arguing against letting me do it was complaining
[3124.52 → 3131.32] not that long ago about how hot the main area in their unit is which is the exact area that I was
[3131.32 → 3137.16] trying to add an ac head to because none of the units our entire building have any ac in that room
[3137.16 → 3141.88] and the only window in that room for our entire building is the sliding glass doors
[3141.88 → 3143.64] so there is not an easy way to do it
[3146.28 → 3152.68] you idiot like I can't ah it's so annoying well Luke
[3152.68 → 3159.48] at least it's very rare for people to vote against their own self-interest
[3165.64 → 3169.16] at least it doesn't happen very often
[3173.00 → 3177.96] okay well my amazing art is done and this isn't going to make any sense so let me explain it
[3177.96 → 3187.16] so uh this area here is said an apartment um that is built like mine and I'm probably going to get
[3187.16 → 3193.48] things screwed up sorry trades in the chat the black outline lines are walls all of these walls
[3193.48 → 3198.52] including there's this like there's a room here and let's say there's a door right there all of these
[3198.52 → 3205.56] walls including this wall in between there's this gap this display that I have on the left here so
[3205.56 → 3210.68] the right-hand side is lightweight concrete so the whole unit that we're on all the individual rooms
[3210.68 → 3216.92] have their own slab of lightweight concrete yep and then there's a gap which is half an inch wide two
[3216.92 → 3224.92] and a half inches deep roughly very roughly the amount wide changes quite a bit as you go along, but it's
[3224.92 → 3232.20] roughly half an inch wide and fairly accurately two and a half inches deep on the other side of that is a
[3232.20 → 3239.32] piece of wood uh this black bar in the middle is expansion joint material and then the red thing
[3240.36 → 3246.36] decently deeply down but in there is a nail because they nail the expansion joint material to the wood
[3246.36 → 3250.36] and then they pour the lightweight concrete the lightweight concrete goes directly against the
[3250.36 → 3260.20] expansion joint material and kind of fuses to it um so the first task that we had was opening all the drywall so that we could access this trench
[3260.20 → 3266.92] and then we had to uh exact knife down each side because the cement would kind of fuse with it and
[3267.96 → 3272.36] the wood side wouldn't fuse with it too much except there is supposed to be adhesive on that side
[3272.36 → 3276.92] so you'd have to cut through the adhesive on one side and then cut through the concrete cement
[3276.92 → 3281.72] whatever fusing on the other side, and then it would be fused to the bottom often as well
[3282.44 → 3288.12] but if you released both the sides you could like to pry it out with this weird thing that I would do with a knife
[3288.12 → 3295.88] knife um which was strenuous and tiring, but eventually we got the whole place done and then
[3295.88 → 3305.96] we had to put closed cell foam backer rod so high density closed cell foam and then like tubes basically
[3305.96 → 3310.44] sure, and we had to shove those in the hole the reason why we had to do that is because the like
[3310.44 → 3319.80] real solution isn't acquirable by armies oh I hate that when you're not allowed to buy the proper thing
[3319.80 → 3328.04] because you did a ton of research on this called up repair shops um there's a place in Ontario that was
[3328.04 → 3334.20] like considering shipping it to us and like giving me a contractor number temporarily yeah I was gonna
[3334.20 → 3339.72] usually say you can like when i was trying to get paint for my bike you just have to find a
[3339.72 → 3344.68] place that there were a couple places locally that were unwilling to do it oh that's a bummer I think
[3344.68 → 3350.04] mostly because i I think they didn't have it on hand so they're going to have to like order stuff in and
[3350.04 → 3355.48] they didn't want to order stuff in for me if I wasn't like a contractor bro but um this other place
[3355.48 → 3361.08] I think had it on hand so they were like we don't love this, but we can ship it to you the problem was it
[3361.08 → 3367.08] wasn't going to get it to us in time so we came with this backer rod solution okay we checked
[3367.08 → 3373.24] it with a few people they said it should be fine um it will help with the whole expansion situation
[3373.24 → 3379.32] right um, but it's its not perfect, but it's pretty good yeah we could do it in time so it sounds good
[3379.32 → 3386.36] but I had to shove this backer rod which is oversized yeah and a circle into this rectangular
[3386.36 → 3390.84] trench and I had to shove it all the way down into the trench literally round peg square hole
[3390.84 → 3395.96] yeah and then and then I had to do another one because you wanted to pretty much fill this trench
[3395.96 → 3401.56] yeah you can't have an air gap in there ideally no so I have to put at least two the most I ever had
[3401.56 → 3407.40] to do was four but almost all the time it was two like over 90 of the time it was two yeah okay um and
[3407.40 → 3413.08] and I had to shove it in like that and I had to do the entire house, and it's like very difficult to get
[3413.08 → 3417.72] in there usually unless the trench gets really wide for a second, and then it just plops right in right
[3417.72 → 3423.56] but usually it's pretty hard to get in there so for double-digit amount of hours I was basically
[3423.56 → 3428.92] shoving as hard as I could like this with my hands down into the trench right and mostly with my right
[3428.92 → 3434.04] one because more coordinated and stronger and I just torched the tendons of my wrist it is
[3437.16 → 3444.92] uh yeah so I don't know I went to physio um, and he said that like the strength is still there and
[3444.92 → 3451.32] things are generally fine um like I can move like this right and I can move like that right and I can
[3451.32 → 3459.56] move like this yep but if I made a fist and then pulled it in it hurts a lot right, right um so no doing
[3459.56 → 3468.04] that for a week and a half somewhere around there okay, but you're done anyway right yeah pretty
[3468.04 → 3477.32] much so the that stuff is oh yeah ouch that wasn't great um podcast injury I'm trying to gesture and i
[3477.32 → 3485.96] just oh doing that stuff oh right what I was going to say the I didn't explain this part so
[3485.96 → 3491.16] the flooding that probably happened from the dishwasher, but we don't know wasn't a crazy amount
[3491.16 → 3497.16] of water so it didn't like seep into the floor or get under the floor, but it flowed enough that it
[3497.16 → 3503.96] poured over into these trenches basically around the entire place yeah and rotted out all this
[3503.96 → 3507.80] expansion joint material yeah, so there was a little bit of mould, but it was mostly just a ton
[3507.80 → 3513.96] of rotten material a wrist brace might be helpful uh yeah I got one um physio guy said to not wear it
[3513.96 → 3518.68] all the time because I'm supposed to actually use it I'm supposed to move it right like I was doing
[3518.68 → 3523.88] this earlier in the show I'm supposed to do this right where i I was wondering what you were doing yeah
[3523.88 → 3528.60] yeah so I'm doing the little exercises like oh that's weird I'm a good boy with the physio exercises
[3528.60 → 3533.72] I actually do them that's good yeah uh so I have other ones that I'm supposed to do as well so I'll
[3533.72 → 3539.48] make sure I'm keeping on top of those uh but yeah the expansion material was rotten um and that was bad
[3539.48 → 3545.64] for a few reasons one of them was because it was promoting mould growth yeah so it looked black it was not
[3545.64 → 3551.56] black mould we got it tested there was no black mould oh there was actually like white mould and some other
[3551.56 → 3559.72] stuff okay it wasn't good, but it wasn't like oh god evacuate the house immediately bad okay um so but
[3559.72 → 3564.36] we didn't want it to get there so get the rotten material out get new stuff in do you have an eta for
[3564.36 → 3568.60] when your place is liable again liable to the point where I don't have to sleep with my parents
[3568.60 → 3576.52] is hopefully Monday really yeah so the progress is since then drywall is back up yeah so the
[3576.52 → 3582.92] holes were bad material taken out good material putting in put in um and then the drywall
[3582.92 → 3588.60] was put back to like seal it, and then we have someone helping with the finishing so budding and
[3588.60 → 3594.52] sanding and all that kind of stuff and that is like almost done he thinks he'll be done by Saturday
[3595.24 → 3601.40] and then we're hoping to paint two rooms the two rooms that would have carpet in it and then carpet
[3601.40 → 3607.64] people are coming in Monday nice, and then we'd be able to like to put the bed back nice and I could
[3607.64 → 3614.04] set up a desk nice some basic stuff like that and that would be like an enormous improvement I noticed
[3614.04 → 3619.32] today on steam because a buddy sent me a steam key for a game that he's working on I haven't launched
[3619.32 → 3626.12] a game on steam since the 18th of last month yeah which is like a month i was telling Emma I think
[3626.12 → 3632.76] this is the longest I've gone without using a desktop of my own since I was probably like eight
[3634.36 → 3641.08] that actually makes sense it's been like a month and a half like the last thing I launched on steam
[3641.08 → 3644.92] wasn't even on my desktop right I was on a trip and I think I launched like slay the spire or something
[3645.96 → 3653.88] like it's been a long time adulting yeah just wow all right yeah um
[3653.88 → 3661.80] um so yeah I missed this are you just helping but your land no I own the place um which is like
[3662.28 → 3672.60] cool and also totally sucks yeah it's a funny assumption that like Luke is poor he's just cheap
[3674.12 → 3680.44] it is a really, really big difference I think other people have problems with spending money I don't think
[3680.44 → 3683.40] I'm cheap okay
[3690.28 → 3696.92] I think because Luke identifies as poor no I don't know he doesn't I really don't he really doesn't I
[3696.92 → 3706.04] don't I don't actually understand where this comes from, but there is a not insignificant amount of the
[3706.04 → 3714.04] Ltd community that like thinks Luke is poor yeah frugal yeah I prefer frugal some people in the there
[3714.04 → 3718.84] was a there was a leg clip on this recently and a bunch of people in the comments are saying it's
[3718.84 → 3727.56] it's frugal no he's not a miser either because Luke spends money on other people he just doesn't he doesn't
[3727.56 → 3736.84] spend money on the kinds of things that it feels like our society encourages us to spend money on
[3736.84 → 3746.44] I don't care about a lot of those things no i i I get it i I totally get it i just uh
[3747.16 → 3753.56] it is just it yeah yeah yeah and like someone in chat says Luke is just smart with his money I don't even want to take that necessarily
[3753.56 → 3759.96] yeah I don't actually think that that's quite the case either because if Luke was smart with his money
[3759.96 → 3763.80] there's a lot of okay how do I say this
[3766.68 → 3767.08] there's
[3770.12 → 3774.60] I know how much money Luke makes and I know how much he spends
[3774.60 → 3782.68] and because we're also friends in addition to me being his employer and so knowing how much
[3782.68 → 3791.32] money he makes I know how little work his capital is doing for him yeah yeah there are some reasons i i i
[3791.32 → 3800.68] know I know and that's and that's totally valid um however i the hmm i
[3800.68 → 3809.64] okay and the thing is in some ways I'm just as bad as him like both of us I would argue worse because
[3809.64 → 3816.20] you don't have the same limitations both of us have completely missed out on like this recent stock
[3816.20 → 3820.92] market bull run oh yeah for instance oh yeah I just want to disclaim all of this you know not this
[3820.92 → 3827.80] none of this is financial advice this is not financial advice um so you know right, but there's been
[3827.80 → 3834.76] like an incredible you know stock bull market for an extended period of time here and there's been
[3834.76 → 3843.40] some fairly obvious plays um, but you know because of our position as tech influencers and because of
[3844.44 → 3851.32] I don't want to be invested in an NVIDIA I think we I think that would be bad I think we both also
[3851.32 → 3861.16] tend to have a bit of a bit of a one in the hand versus two in the bush sort of mentality I think that
[3861.80 → 3870.28] um part of it is is is just I think part of it is growing up poor um like growing up without money and
[3871.00 → 3880.28] yeah yeah and i I think people I tell that story that was a relatively short period of my upbringing we
[3880.28 → 3888.04] were fine most of the time but like that bit was at a formative time and made me think about money in
[3888.04 → 3893.96] a certain way like I mean i not long after that time I blew everything I had on a computer like
[3894.84 → 3901.88] and we were both lets be real we were both young dudes you know and definitely wasted money
[3901.88 → 3909.40] on things like let's let's be very clear but I think that in general like we both experienced times
[3910.20 → 3917.56] when there was real scarcity yeah I guess that would be the best way to kind of describe it because
[3918.28 → 3925.40] like I was never on the verge of complete homelessness or anything like that, but there were definitely
[3926.36 → 3933.00] there were times of there were tighter times yeah yeah yeah and so recognizing the very real possibility
[3933.00 → 3940.76] that like money could be gone and there would not be any more coming uh I think put both of us in a
[3940.76 → 3949.16] position where what you have in the bank um seems a lot more important than what you could get out there
[3949.16 → 3954.36] if you like deployed it if you took it out of the bank and with inflation going the way that it is
[3954.36 → 3962.20] like the money that we've had sitting in the bank has been rotted yeah like to a degree that makes me
[3963.24 → 3967.48] genuinely pretty uncomfortable to think about like how much of it has just
[3968.92 → 3977.96] rotted yeah um like man it's its i I still like i I went through a period for a bit sorry one second i
[3977.96 → 3982.84] just want to address this really quickly yeah cane said regarding investing in NVIDIA better me have the
[3982.84 → 3990.12] money than somebody else yeah but like I do stuff with the lab yeah it's just not I don't want to be
[3990.12 → 3996.68] invested in NVIDIA yeah it just I don't want that uh not that I don't think I could handle
[3997.96 → 4001.72] that like potential conflicting interest thing I don't think that would be a problem for me at all
[4001.72 → 4008.28] to be completely honest but I just don't even want anyone thinking it I'm just not gonna mess around
[4008.28 → 4013.96] with that apparently this is a whole thing the psychology of scarcity uh explores how deprivation
[4013.96 → 4020.28] wreaks havoc on cognition and decision-making being poor requires so much mental energy that those with
[4020.28 → 4025.64] limited means be they sugarcane farmers in India or New Jersey mall goers are more likely to make mistakes
[4025.64 → 4031.24] and bad decisions than those with bigger financial cushions that actually makes a ton of sense I think
[4031.24 → 4037.80] there's also like I don't know there's comfort levels I don't necessarily think that being a
[4037.80 → 4044.28] risk-averse is a bad decision I don't think that maximizing the potential value play over under on
[4044.28 → 4051.24] every dollar that you have is necessary no, no I don't I don't think it's necessary and the comfort
[4051.24 → 4055.00] and like no I should be doing more with my stuff for sure there are certain limitations whatever we don't
[4055.00 → 4064.44] need to get into that um there too but uh assuming I did do some of it I still wouldn't do a ton
[4065.00 → 4072.52] yeah because the comfort of just I'm good is like really nice and i I see value in that and I don't
[4072.52 → 4081.40] only see value in dollar numbers which i uh some people do and I don't see it that way I see like
[4081.40 → 4087.00] comfort lack of concern not needing to check the stock market twice a day every day all the time
[4087.64 → 4092.44] those types of things is like it's kind of nice like I remember I knew some people that made a
[4092.44 → 4099.08] lot of money off of crypto I had also remember hanging out with those people it's it was all that
[4099.08 → 4105.16] I think bro when it was going up it was all I could think about and when it was going down it was like
[4105.16 → 4110.44] super all I could think about yeah and I wasn't even in super heavy or anything we were just talking we
[4110.44 → 4114.60] were just it was perfect actually we were just talking about playing games when you're younger
[4114.60 → 4120.92] and how you can like actually just think about the game yeah like no not any more not if you're
[4120.92 → 4126.60] leveraged into something not if your livelihood, and you're like eating next month relies on some
[4126.60 → 4133.08] some relies on a game you're playing yeah um relies on like somebody associated to the company that
[4133.08 → 4140.28] you're invested in not saying something crazy yeah or doing whatever or saying something crazy and
[4140.28 → 4146.92] mooning anyway sure whatever right yeah because i have to say man this the stock market feels more just
[4147.64 → 4152.36] meme stocks and gambling than ever and that's something that we've talked about extensively on
[4152.36 → 4160.36] the show how it just feels like gambling right now um Asian says that gold Xbox controller though okay
[4160.36 → 4166.44] that was a that was a calculated risk probably made money it was an amount that I was very comfortable
[4167.08 → 4173.16] you know depreciating a little bit and oh yes it's definitely made money yeah
[4174.04 → 4180.44] well what would you look up gold index or what uh goldprice.org is the best one that I've found
[4183.48 → 4188.68] oh yeah I guess we could do that uh these are one day let's look at how long do you think it's been
[4188.68 → 4197.56] five years uh when did yeah when did we uh make the gold oh that's silver uh hold on five years
[4201.72 → 4206.76] hold on when did we make the gold controller four years ago yeah so five years is the closest I can
[4206.76 → 4211.48] get because it's its one and then five or one two five yeah I think the gold controller did okay
[4211.48 → 4219.48] uh it was like over doubled in value yeah I think well we spent like 20 grand on the like
[4220.04 → 4225.72] craftsmanship of it or something like that 15 something it was like many many
[4225.72 → 4231.80] that in labour hours how much was the value of just the gold uh disclosed I don't remember I think it's
[4231.80 → 4237.56] in the video but I don't remember the exact I don't remember how many ounces sure went into it yeah um that
[4237.56 → 4246.84] was like kind of a minor detail in my mind um you know what they ended up uh certain people in
[4246.84 → 4250.84] chatter like sit his is why you have a financial advisor company yeah and a lot of them would say
[4250.84 → 4256.20] just invest everything in big seven and I would not want to do that oh dude I would like that it's
[4256.20 → 4262.84] not it's not an automatic solve all I'd be terrified yeah I'd be terrified to throw everything
[4262.84 → 4268.44] into magnificent seven right now and this is not financial advice of them are that is a thing
[4268.44 → 4273.48] this is not financial advice you're making assumptions I'm literally not I know people
[4273.48 → 4277.96] that have done this because of financial advisors I'm actually not making an assumption I was actually
[4277.96 → 4286.04] chatting with CEO uh Mr Baron tong uh the other day and um we were I was sending him this article uh
[4286.04 → 4291.80] research by mark Andy the chief economist of moody's analytics showed earlier in this year
[4291.80 → 4299.16] and again recently that the top 10 percent of earners in the U.S. are responsible for just under 50
[4299.96 → 4303.56] of all consumer spending like
[4306.28 → 4312.44] I've been trying to wrap my brain around this for a little while how LTT store sales investing
[4314.60 → 4320.36] chats driving me insane today no they do the investing that doesn't change anything if that's
[4320.36 → 4323.64] what they're just going to do that doesn't change anything yeah there's also a problem right now
[4323.64 → 4328.76] where you invest you might be investing in companies that are cyclically invested in the big seven
[4328.76 → 4336.28] so it's like it doesn't even really matter like it's there are absolutely ways to do it properly
[4336.28 → 4342.28] it well properly um and there are ways that I would be more down with and there are advisors that
[4342.28 → 4346.28] will think more the way that I would like to think, and you can also explain to them that you want
[4346.28 → 4349.80] to approach it a certain way, and they might do it in that way and that's cool and there's also
[4349.80 → 4353.32] fees that come along with that and that might be bad and who knows and whatever, and it doesn't matter
[4353.32 → 4358.44] go away ninja man away not the right people to talk to about this it's weird to see Linus be the
[4358.44 → 4364.68] calm one and Luke getting angry at the chat I told you he's grumpy today he's tired having it
[4364.68 → 4370.60] you get some rest guy yeah it's fine he's good uh so what I was gonna so right I've been trying to wrap
[4370.60 → 4377.56] my brain around like how things are pretty, pretty tough right now in general like you've got you
[4377.56 → 4384.28] know dollar giant mooning because way more people are shopping at the dollar store which by the way
[4384.28 → 4389.40] there is nothing wrong with shopping at the dollar store one of my kids made an offhand comment about
[4389.40 → 4395.32] like shopping at the dollar store or something like that or where were we no we weren't at the dollar
[4395.32 → 4401.72] store we were yeah no we weren't at the dollar store, but we were somewhere, and we were at Walmart
[4401.72 → 4409.00] that's right we were at Walmart because um i I promised her like a daddy-daughter day and um she
[4409.00 → 4413.96] she could pick any activity she wanted, and she wanted to make slime so uh Walmart is the place that
[4413.96 → 4418.84] I know that I can get boxes of borax because superstore doesn't carry it, or they didn't have the last time i
[4418.84 → 4423.24] checked and I didn't feel like going to a dozen different places so uh we went to Walmart so we picked up
[4423.24 → 4428.36] some borax some white glue um, and we didn't need food colouring we already had that the point is you
[4428.36 → 4431.96] don't care about the ingredients the slime you care about the story maybe, or you don't I don't know
[4431.96 → 4437.96] you're watching one show so who knows um the point is that we were there, and she wanted to get something
[4437.96 → 4442.36] I forget what it was, but it was something that I basically was like no we'd be better off getting
[4442.36 → 4446.20] that at the dollar store, and she goes well wouldn't it be a worse one and I go whoa hold on
[4446.20 → 4453.80] no the place that you buy something does not indicate the quality of it you can buy Campbell's
[4453.80 → 4459.64] soup at the dollar store, or you can buy Campbell's soup at some bogie supermarket, and they are the
[4459.64 → 4465.24] exact same thing as long as oh okay Campbell's soup is canned so I wouldn't even worry about the expiry
[4465.24 → 4469.64] date like sometimes you can get food stuffs that are closer to the expiry date at the dollar store so
[4469.64 → 4475.88] you do kind of have to watch for that but if it is the same product then no you just get it wherever
[4475.88 → 4483.56] you get the best deal there is no there's no better status in buying something at a fancier store and
[4483.56 → 4488.28] paying more for if it's just not something that I'm ever going to believe in um
[4490.92 → 4494.36] how did I get on this topic again can't remember
[4494.36 → 4501.00] no not what was before that chat might remember
[4503.48 → 4509.72] yes uh top 10 percent of earners spend 15 percent of 50 percent of consumers right right
[4509.72 → 4513.56] so I was talking about dollar giant, so dollar giant is like doing great because more and more people
[4513.56 → 4518.04] are resorting to shopping at the dollar store which I just wanted to make clear is not a problem
[4518.04 → 4523.96] shopping at the dollar store is totally fine uh but for a lot of people where they shop is part of
[4523.96 → 4529.96] their self-worth equation I suppose, and so they're you know they only shop at the dollar store during
[4529.96 → 4534.92] hard times apparently I'm like okay sure whatever um I will never be too cool to shop at the dollar
[4534.92 → 4541.08] store I give you my personal Linus tech tips guarantee of that um, and so I've been trying to figure out okay
[4541.64 → 4549.88] so with things being tough, and they're being all of these indicators right that things are tough
[4549.88 → 4556.92] I've been trying to figure out why like LTT store sales are not falling like why LTT store is still doing
[4556.92 → 4568.60] fine, and so I saw this and I was like holy crap I had no idea how one-sided it was I didn't realize
[4568.60 → 4576.12] consumer spending would track that way oh like like like that much though that's, that's wild anyway so he
[4576.12 → 4586.36] countered with s p 500 is basically s p 10 because the top 10 companies are about 40 of the value and
[4586.36 → 4593.80] have been responsible for 70 of the index growth so when you so i I had an I had an I had kind of a
[4593.80 → 4598.68] an annoying conversation well I shouldn't say annoying conversation with Yvonne because she was just the
[4598.68 → 4605.64] messenger but I was annoyed about a conversation I was having with Yvonne because um she was talking about
[4605.64 → 4613.16] some investment service or something and uh she basically goes yeah so like they just recommend
[4613.16 → 4622.12] like this s p thing and I go okay that's fine um, but there are a handful of companies in the s p that i
[4622.12 → 4631.72] think are just ludicrously like overvalued bubble the fundamentals of this company make absolutely no
[4631.72 → 4638.52] sense one of the ones that I'll that I'll name is tesla I think tesla's valuation is just bat crazy
[4638.52 → 4646.04] right now um they are really struggling to sell cars that is only going to get worse as the U.S. subsidies
[4646.04 → 4653.64] go away as the Chinese market just effective like dumping from domestic Chinese companies continues
[4654.44 → 4660.20] and as they continue to struggle to compete in Europe like it is not looking good for tesla's car
[4660.20 → 4667.72] business and sure fine tesla's an AI company or something, and they make humanoid robots but like
[4669.88 → 4677.80] sorry what is optimum's compete level like right now bad and what is the indication that that will get
[4677.80 → 4688.36] better nothing not much uh okay sure and then the whole AI thing right, so tesla is a super-duper d duper
[4688.36 → 4697.08] AI company, but also you know when they're supposed to get GE sorry GE's when they're supposed to get GPUs
[4697.08 → 4703.80] they just get sort of unilaterally redirected to other companies like you know Kai that are also you know
[4703.80 → 4710.44] predominantly owned by overlapping ownership groups like the whole thing is just a complete smoke
[4710.44 → 4716.12] and mirror show, and so I wanted absolutely no exposure to it and they basically the response
[4716.12 → 4722.12] is just like well we don't do that and I go okay well then I don't do whatever your thing is um
[4723.72 → 4729.24] because I don't want any exposure to that and that was even before I realized just how bad it is
[4729.24 → 4738.76] the top 10 companies 40 of the value 70 of the growth, so this like bull run that's taken place
[4738.76 → 4746.04] over the last little while here has been driven by predominantly the AI and their and their
[4746.04 → 4751.72] cyclical investing as well to be clear I did not just call it the AI I was going to say the AI bubble
[4751.72 → 4756.36] but I wasn't sure if I wanted to use the b word sure, but there's the like it seems like a bubble
[4756.36 → 4761.72] not investment advice x amount of money goes from open AI to oracle x amount of money goes from oracle
[4761.72 → 4767.32] to NVIDIA oh x amount of money goes from NVIDIA to open AI dude big circle thing this is also not the
[4767.32 → 4774.52] first time we've seen this happen um I saw the funniest bring it back on uh here this is
[4774.52 → 4779.80] amazing Dan I'm sending this to you to bring up on the show dude you're gonna you're gonna freaking
[4779.80 → 4787.72] love this where is Dan like there's also the like the I think fairly old school like I'm gonna
[4787.72 → 4793.16] get the numbers wrong but I think it's like 20 per sector maximum five percent per company maximum if
[4793.16 → 4800.12] it goes above any of that sell it off until it gets down to that number blah blah blah blah thing
[4800.12 → 4805.80] and that's all cool, but there's unless you're watching it decently close I think there are issues
[4805.80 → 4809.00] with that because of like what I was mentioning earlier where all these companies are kind of tied
[4809.00 → 4814.20] into each other in a variety of different ways uh no I want you to throw it up on screen
[4815.88 → 4822.44] yeah just get me that photo carousel because Luke you're going to love this um this is a meme that i
[4822.44 → 4829.40] caught over on Wall Street bets uh earlier today this card game would be lit um Dan you ready
[4829.40 → 4838.92] uh that's fine just throw up the page it doesn't really matter he's doing it he's doing it
[4838.92 → 4843.64] he's got this actually made me laugh out loud and then I showed it to a couple of other people on
[4843.64 → 4851.80] set and they actually lol um it's a big problem right now oh dude it's a huge dude it's wild there is a
[4851.80 → 4857.00] money sink happening because there's a little bit of loss every time that moves around no it gains it
[4857.00 → 4862.28] multiplies every time it moves around as far as I can tell because it pulls out from investors
[4863.24 → 4868.60] yeah yeah hit it love this uh you might have to zoom it a bit so we can see the cards
[4868.60 → 4872.04] I see where this is going
[4876.76 → 4881.96] no, no give us more time give us more time Luke doesn't read so fast yeah I did read this but
[4882.84 → 4890.20] yeah that is a problem economic ouroboros I love it fantastic okay next oh man
[4890.20 → 4905.40] it's Jim Cramer legendary creature human do opposite that's fantastic power zero wisdom minus two
[4905.40 → 4914.52] charisma nine very loud seconds before it crashes the stock is gone to the mood that's great oh man
[4914.52 → 4925.00] oh man yeah yeah yeah hit me immediately halves your portfolio oh man that's pretty good it's like
[4926.12 → 4932.28] i uh i I absolutely love this Subreddit not because I actually want to invest any of my money in
[4932.28 → 4939.96] anything right now uh the oh the one that's missing is uh Nana's inheritance so we've got ghost grandma uh
[4939.96 → 4945.16] forces player to buy overvalued stock no reduces total value of portfolio by 30 percent
[4947.64 → 4953.08] oh, oh man oh man this has been this has been active all day there's a Jerome Powell card now
[4953.08 → 4961.64] ability money printer go burr um effect bag holder targets opponent gains unmarketable assets
[4963.00 → 4965.48] transitory all effects are temporary maybe
[4965.48 → 4977.40] oh man okay anyway that's a wild world right now that legitimately sounds like an outstanding card
[4977.40 → 4977.72] game
[4980.12 → 4984.44] but just like it'd be like the Calvin ball of card games because I just feel like there'd be no rules
[4984.44 → 4991.80] and nobody wins you know you could totally make that game work maybe I think you I think you could you
[4991.80 → 4998.44] think so like a finance deck builder game I think you could, it's so funny i
[4998.44 → 5006.12] guarantee you like all this is just like AI generated like slop, but that doesn't change that it's super
[5006.12 → 5012.20] funny you know that might do pretty okay if you make it right now it's so topical oh my god
[5012.20 → 5017.80] there are so many more cards than when I looked at it earlier uh Luigi time trap card
[5017.80 → 5022.12] the target stock loses half its value when activated
[5031.72 → 5040.04] oh man I do want to take a moment in spite of the fact that he's laughing to point out that murder is
[5040.04 → 5045.00] not an answer okay that's an important thing for us to get out there
[5049.72 → 5054.84] merch messages sure is that what we're supposed to be doing I think that no this is going to be my
[5054.84 → 5059.64] this is going to be my third or fourth attempt at starting the creator warehouse announcement yes
[5059.64 → 5067.24] note samples of underwear and pet bandanas are on the table and an example of a utility shirt is

[5383.96 → 5389.40] size because they certainly aren't mine they looked pretty big okay are they too big for you too I don't
[5389.40 → 5392.04] know I don't even know what size they are, but they look pretty big you know what I'm not going to make
[5392.04 → 5401.72] you disclose your underwear size on stream so that is me okay sure I was like man I would
[5401.72 → 5409.32] be I would be swimming in these look huge though that's weird I put LDT underwear on literally
[5409.32 → 5415.00] every day so okay we'll see are they are it possible maybe they've shrunk maybe the ones I have
[5415.00 → 5419.56] have shrunk yeah it's its possible well it shouldn't be that much it's only a little bit of cotton
[5419.56 → 5427.08] maybe it's just maybe they looked huge in my hands maybe I don't know no I just held it up
[5427.08 → 5435.72] he's used to that though it's very ego boosting anyway we used the uh we used the same patterns
[5435.72 → 5442.68] as last time so it shouldn't, it shouldn't be anything uh anyway check them out leg.GG slash undies my
[5442.68 → 5446.60] notes say probably a good idea to click this and check out the photos of course they put me front and
[5446.60 → 5451.56] centre thank you for that we always have we always have fun we always have fun with the underwear
[5451.56 → 5459.56] shoots the anon mask was surprising oh yeah I don't know what I was going for here exactly I'm not sure
[5459.56 → 5466.28] i just the uh the place where we do these shoots is in the bedroom set and then the props land is
[5466.28 → 5470.12] but it's not a bedroom at all anymore I know it's still called bedroom set yeah fair enough
[5470.12 → 5481.48] um anyway we've got we've got lots of we've got lots of pictures of LTT staff in their underwear
[5483.16 → 5487.72] nice so if whether you want to buy whether you want to buy the underwear or not
[5488.92 → 5494.76] uh there 's's that um massive shout out to the CW team for the fun photo shoots
[5494.76 → 5503.16] and one more thing we also just launched the office utility shirt uh, but you know what I'm
[5503.16 → 5509.40] gonna I'll pull up the Luke we'll pull up the page for this it's a dude the just practical office
[5509.40 → 5516.52] wear stuff has been absolutely killer for us uh it just sells because people just want something that
[5516.52 → 5524.52] they know is good that is quality and uh that they can wear to work uh it's a smart workshop shirt with a
[5524.52 → 5529.24] little bit of stretch cool a hidden titanium carabiner clip in the front pocket and a
[5529.24 → 5534.60] little integrated screen wipe at the bottom for glasses phone screens or whatever the screen wipe
[5534.60 → 5539.56] is awesome yeah it's also designed to keep relatively wrinkle free without ironing and is available now
[5539.56 → 5546.60] at leg.GG office shirt all right Dan what are we supposed to be doing now we got a couple merch messages
[5547.40 → 5552.68] um oh yeah oh for those who are new the way to send a merch message is you go to ltdstore.com we don't
[5552.68 → 5557.96] want you just throwing money at your screen we're not that into just donating to people who frankly
[5557.96 → 5563.08] don't need it however much they might pretend to be poor and need it um it doesn't have to pretend
[5563.08 → 5568.20] we think that if you're going to throw money at your screen you should get high quality goods in the
[5568.20 → 5572.12] mail in return so head over to ltdstore.com add something to your cart you'll see the box for a
[5572.12 → 5576.44] merch message you type a merch message it goes to producer Dan, and he will filter through them and he
[5576.44 → 5582.92] he'll get rid of the ones that have you know bad words, and you know I don't know uh
[5583.96 → 5589.32] seahorse emojis in them or whatever the case may be, and he will curate some for us to talk about on
[5589.32 → 5592.68] the show oh some of them he just like puts up here so you can have like a little shout-out hi mom or
[5592.68 → 5599.00] whatever if your mom watches the wan show which mine does she might well yeah yours might yeah so
[5599.00 → 5606.68] sample size of no mine doesn't uh sample size of two 50 of moms watch the wan show uh you heard it
[5606.68 → 5615.08] here first that's good math sample size is perfect yep uh the point is Dan will show us how merch
[5615.08 → 5622.68] messages work thank you Dan sure thing I've got a few here hey DLL love the show question for Linus
[5622.68 → 5628.68] how are the Ltd cables coming along I can't wait to get them oh perfect I'm so excited i
[5628.68 → 5636.04] I ran into yet another situation yesterday where i just I was troubleshooting something and
[5636.76 → 5642.92] maybe this affects me disproportionately and maybe for a lot of you don't have the same kind of
[5643.64 → 5651.40] um emotional fatigue with stuff not working when you're troubleshooting, but we were having an issue
[5651.40 → 5656.04] with uh we were doing an AMD ultimate tech upgrade for john from the lab actually i was at his place
[5656.04 → 5666.68] yesterday and a big part of his setup is his uh his driving sim rig and so like his upgrade basically
[5666.68 → 5673.72] he sank like over half of it into a big screen beyond two nice yeah because he didn't have he didn't have
[5673.72 → 5679.80] base stations, yet he didn't have knuckles controllers yet okay so he got a big screen beyond two and based
[5679.80 → 5687.16] three base stations and knuckles controllers, and then he also got a new GPU for his like media pc
[5687.16 → 5694.36] because that's where his VR setup is so he like basically blew the budget on his probably like the
[5694.36 → 5700.12] the lowest amount of packages oh dude there was like nothing because the rest of it was a 77 inch OLED
[5701.24 → 5707.72] also for the VR space yeah so it's like the before and after is like wild because it's he was running he
[5707.72 → 5719.00] was rocking an oculus cv1 still yeah that's an enormous upgrade and an insignia like 42-inch TV okay
[5719.00 → 5725.08] wow so he is like that's awesome completely zero to hero it is it was it's like if someone upgraded from
[5725.08 → 5730.84] a Chevy volt to like a Tehran like it's crazy like not even that it would have been like if I went
[5730.84 → 5736.68] straight from the civic to the take I was going to say I think it's more yeah it's crazy anyway that's so as we
[5736.68 → 5740.60] were getting toward the end of the shoot and everyone's blood sugar was low and people had
[5740.60 → 5748.60] places to be we were running into an issue with the USB connection that goes over to his sim chair
[5748.60 → 5755.64] that connects to his pedals his shifter he got a new a wheelbase uh like a direct drive wheelbase sorry
[5755.64 → 5762.12] that is the one last thing that I missed and like the wheelbase wasn't getting picked up, and we're like
[5762.12 → 5770.76] okay is it the new wheelbase is it the cable between the wheelbase and the hub are it the hub is it the
[5770.76 → 5776.68] port on the computer and when you're troubleshooting something like that oh is it the cable going from
[5776.68 → 5784.44] the hub to the computer when you're troubleshooting a multi-element um system where any one link in this
[5784.44 → 5793.00] chain can be bad, and you have no way of knowing which one it is man does it ever feel good to go
[5793.00 → 5800.60] into your backpack take out this cable which I'm using to charge my laptop right now actually and know
[5800.60 → 5810.76] for sure that it is not that cable that means a lot to me which is why we are developing LTT cables
[5810.76 → 5819.64] they are not going to be the cheapest cables but what they will be now is clearly labelled so the ends
[5819.64 → 5828.20] just say LTT logo on one side and then on the other side how many gigabits per second and how many watts
[5829.24 → 5837.24] that's it feed that exactly that's all I care about, and they're thick they're not light they're not the
[5837.24 → 5842.36] most like they're not the world's most flexible cables they're not the world's lightest cables by any
[5842.36 → 5847.96] stretch of the imagination they're like they're thick chunky boys um, but that is because instead
[5847.96 → 5854.92] of using twisted pairs for our high speed data lines we are using coax they're using coax on all lengths
[5855.80 → 5863.16] uh I believe so okay because we're using the same cable stock across all there was a difference for the shorter ones
[5863.16 → 5869.96] I'm very likely two ones maybe okay you might be thinking of that there's like no way I know more
[5869.96 → 5875.16] about this than you because the USB two ones I believe are a little bit skinnier okay um sure I don't
[5875.16 → 5883.80] know so anyway so we're using coax with each high speed data uh wire individually shielded
[5883.80 → 5889.16] insulated crazy um so I am so
[5890.68 → 5897.80] freaking excited um they are still pretty flexible because we use like a silicone style sheathing on them
[5897.80 → 5903.48] so they're like they're more they're more flexible than they should be being that thick compared to a lot of other stuff
[5903.96 → 5909.56] uh but I feel nice the silicone sheathing is really nice i um I've been using one every day because
[5909.56 → 5915.72] in my uh enforced homelessness because my employer doesn't pay me at all um i I've been
[5917.72 → 5922.52] I've been living out of an out of a backpack basically for a while and deploying my laptop
[5922.52 → 5929.48] like everywhere I go whenever I need to do work or whatever else and I have an external um monitor
[5929.48 → 5935.00] an external USB monitor, and it needs a decent cable I don't know what the exact requirements are
[5935.00 → 5939.32] probably thunderbolt 3 or something um but to be clear they do not have
[5939.56 → 5944.04] the like active chip sets for thunderbolt in them just want to make that clear, but it needs a
[5944.04 → 5948.04] decent cable yeah I'm sure there's a variety of ways it could find a way to work because I think usb4
[5948.04 → 5952.20] doesn't look for the thunderbolt chip for the handshake something the whole standard
[5952.20 → 5957.48] has gotten extremely messy I just want to make it clear there is no thunderbolt chip in it sure fair
[5957.48 → 5965.64] enough that's all um but i i i basically none of the cables that I have worked with it yeah I had one
[5965.64 → 5969.16] other previous cable that worked, but it just gets mixed in with all the other ones because it's just
[5969.16 → 5973.08] plain black and there's no there isn't even a branding symbol on it there's not it's just a
[5973.08 → 5978.36] plain black USB cable yep so at a certain point it just got mixed in I don't know which one it is
[5978.36 → 5984.84] um, but this one always works for it so I have one of the LTT cables in my kit, and it's always the like
[5984.84 → 5993.24] I need a good cable for something it's just like okay sweet it'll work cool yeah so uh when are they
[5993.24 → 6000.60] coming uh maybe uh why don't um Dan why don't you read another merch message and maybe Luke can
[6001.32 → 6007.16] focus on that merch message while I check the product roadmap and see if um see is I know when they're
[6007.16 → 6021.96] coming uh yeah sure what is that timing uh it's my credit card yes what advice you have for dad
[6022.68 → 6028.60] that of what I know you don't have kids, but you've spoken fondly of your own dad yeah
[6034.52 → 6045.80] uh categories have been a little odd in the past I sat down with um Sarah Dave muted what I was muted
[6045.80 → 6050.44] uh Luke what advice do you have for dads you don't have kids, but you've spoken fondly of your own dad
[6051.48 → 6056.84] and then there was something about the categories on the site oh yeah um i I sat down with Sarah Dave
[6056.84 → 6064.20] and Taryn actually earlier this week, and we looked at the wireframe for the redesigned LTT store site
[6064.20 → 6070.20] it's not coming tomorrow it's not coming next week it's not even coming next month, but it is coming
[6072.04 → 6073.08] cool uh
[6076.60 → 6084.12] I don't know be present I guess like uh I'm I have a lot of fond memories of my dad um
[6085.64 → 6090.12] I like one that I think we both share is there was one time he came home from work at like
[6090.12 → 6095.32] I think it was like one or two in the morning or something and uh we played we were playing super
[6095.32 → 6102.12] Mario bros because we're both night owls, and then we went and sat out on his car and watched the sunrise
[6102.12 → 6109.32] like way after that, and it was just like awesome like even when life was tough for him, he was around
[6109.80 → 6116.36] and life what when life wasn't particularly tough for him, he was around just like even more he was a
[6116.36 → 6123.24] coach on like every sports team I had uh which was awesome um that's another important thing he was a
[6123.24 → 6127.88] coach on every sports team I had and certain other kids on the team would be concerned about the
[6127.88 → 6135.24] favouritism of that for about five minutes into the first practice and then never again um because he
[6136.52 → 6143.08] treated me either equally or maybe on the first day or so a little bit harsher than the other people just
[6143.08 → 6147.48] kind of proved that he would be treating me equally which was like super appreciated by me but I don't
[6147.48 → 6154.44] know if we ever really talked about it um and just being a perfect example in general I think
[6156.20 → 6163.72] from my limited experience with my niece um and being around certain other people's kids and
[6163.72 → 6169.64] whatnot they're much more observant um way more than you give them credit for so you don't necessarily
[6169.64 → 6176.68] need to like to tell them all the things um being the example showing not telling can can often be
[6176.68 → 6182.92] good I think a lot of the best lessons that I took from my dad were things that I saw him do
[6182.92 → 6188.12] not things that he necessarily he said a lot of great things to me too but like I remember one time
[6189.00 → 6195.64] i i I didn't really click this in my head for so long but years later my dad and I were having
[6195.64 → 6202.68] like a debate about something and I'm not going to get into the details but I was taking a counter
[6202.68 → 6209.00] argument to something that especially in hindsight was actually very core and important to him and i
[6209.00 → 6212.76] was having this debate with him while he was driving me for like an hour to the ferry
[6214.68 → 6220.84] like what am I doing, but he kept a complete level ahead he didn't like to abandon me on the side of the
[6220.84 → 6228.12] road um and was there for the discussion despite it being something that was important to him and i
[6228.12 → 6239.08] was going against it um and like i I don't know he just is there be open because they're going to poke at
[6239.08 → 6246.28] things about you once they get old enough um and don't take it too personally be present love unconditionally
[6246.28 → 6257.08] and show good examples hooray hopefully any of that was useful the most precise thing that I can find
[6257.08 → 6272.12] says q4 um oh hold on okay so I have an I do have a schedule it says uh that these should arrive
[6272.12 → 6282.36] before Black Friday now getting these over the line has been a logistical challenge there's all the
[6282.36 → 6285.72] different lengths there's all the different packaging there's all the different ends we're
[6285.72 → 6294.92] going to have USA and USB c I think at the start um and so it's its been a whole thing we did our best
[6294.92 → 6300.76] to nail the product mix for all the different end terminations and all the different lengths because
[6300.76 → 6306.76] part of the idea behind this is that they should be very cable management friendly so you should be
[6306.76 → 6311.40] able to instead of just looping up all your extra wires under your desk you should just have cables
[6311.40 → 6320.60] that are the right length so there could be lengths that we don't have a ton of that might end up selling
[6320.60 → 6329.16] more than we thought they would if you want to make sure that you get what you want you should probably not
[6329.16 → 6334.92] delay that is all I will say about you think like restocking is going to be tough no we will restock
[6334.92 → 6341.56] them we will but I don't know what the timeline will look like yeah and because this is a completely
[6341.56 → 6345.72] new product category for us, and it's like he said they're gonna they're not necessarily going to be
[6345.72 → 6350.44] super cheap so it's hard to decide how many of these things are going to bring in new category they're
[6350.44 → 6356.76] not cheap for us like that's that's the thing that I think a lot of people miss about the
[6357.88 → 6364.44] merch on LTT store this is not a three dollar screwdriver from Alibaba that we just put our
[6364.44 → 6372.04] brand on this is custom-made uh this is this has expensive materials in it, and it's the same
[6372.04 → 6379.00] with the cables these are expensive this cable stock is really really really expensive the validation is
[6379.00 → 6384.36] expensive so it's just yeah it's just not going to be cheap that's all there is that's all there is to
[6387.72 → 6393.96] uh sure what do you want to do for what do you want to do for topic do you want bad news or worse news
[6396.36 → 6401.40] is there any is there anything that's good no just pick one bad or worse oh sinful hands
[6401.40 → 6408.12] ask for worse okay you did too yeah hp has been pulling support documents for retired products
[6409.96 → 6417.48] so this was posted on by gremlin12345 over on the LTT Subreddit, and it is a big load of
[6417.48 → 6425.48] bulls** and chips um hp retired product hp policy for products no longer supported hp support may vary
[6425.48 → 6431.96] by product once a product is retired the official hp support content troubleshooting articles user guides
[6431.96 → 6439.72] how-to videos etc for that product is removed from the hp website additional support content may still be
[6439.72 → 6447.80] available may still be available via the hp forums or from third-party websites however hp takes no
[6447.80 → 6455.24] responsibility for content authored by third parties this is understandable no
[6455.24 → 6465.64] I didn't say justifiable I said understandable I can comprehend the rationale behind the decision
[6466.20 → 6473.24] you are no longer selling this product and at a certain point at a certain point
[6474.36 → 6479.72] eventually like would you expect General Electric to have a product page up
[6479.72 → 6482.68] for their original light bulb today
[6485.00 → 6488.44] no because it never had a product pages in the first place but even if it did
[6488.44 → 6493.24] would you expect them a hundred years later or whatever to have a product page up
[6493.24 → 6498.76] so there is a line I think it'd be cool it'd be right but I think it'd be pretty cool would you
[6498.76 → 6503.96] expect it no, so there is a line somewhere I don't know where that line there is a line somewhere
[6504.60 → 6512.84] however and this is my counterargument hp there are two big differences here one
[6514.12 → 6519.96] is that you haven't even really existed that long you ain't General Electric pretty much everything that
[6519.96 → 6531.00] has ever like existed as a hp product is uh within the living memory of someone on earth today okay so that's that's number one
[6532.44 → 6539.80] number two is that it's pretty low effort okay you already had the page it was already there
[6540.52 → 6547.48] I'm not saying that you have to have it like front and centre on your website you know I go to hp.com and the first thing I see is
[6547.48 → 6553.80] you know support downloads for some pavilion laptop from the early 2000s that wouldn't make any sense
[6554.60 → 6563.08] obviously but if you were to say for instance have a mirror like an archive old site or something like
[6563.08 → 6568.28] that i I would say that would be a reasonable compromise and I really don't think that the
[6568.28 → 6573.96] hosting cost would be that much I don't think you'd even need a mirror reason number the third
[6573.96 → 6585.08] that I am offended by this is that so many hp products are utterly reliant on your support documentation and
[6585.08 → 6594.04] especially downloads in order to function at all and there's a particular pet peeve of mine that I've had
[6594.04 → 6603.64] issues with hp products on that would be horribly impacted by this and that is vendor specific
[6603.64 → 6613.40] drivers my god do I ever want to just put a fist through the screen every time a bunch of those
[6613.40 → 6622.44] I try to install a GPU driver, and it doesn't work because the laptop vendor has their own specific
[6622.44 → 6629.48] validated snowflake version of the driver that is the only one I can use and if you pull that driver off
[6629.48 → 6638.20] your site so help me I will curse your name I will curse your name that's all I can really do I don't
[6638.20 → 6643.32] really have the power to do more I know you guys were probably hoping for some kind of like dramatic
[6643.88 → 6648.68] action that I could take but curse your name is about the best I can do not bad
[6648.68 → 6658.04] oh yeah no I mean intel for all their warts um yeah they do this that's pretty old 12 years
[6658.04 → 6664.92] yeah I don't I don't think it's a big ask I think you can bury it and I think you can throw warnings all
[6664.92 → 6669.80] over the place sure yeah this is not supported this is not got the latest not been updated this is not
[6669.80 → 6676.36] supported this might not work anymore due to whatever reason number the fourth is that
[6677.16 → 6682.20] and I know that this might actually be a significant part of the reason that you pulled this stuff down
[6682.76 → 6690.04] but sometimes the hp support page is the only place that I can find an obscure driver for something that i
[6690.04 → 6695.00] actually need for a different device a dell is another one too like if you're looking for
[6695.00 → 6702.04] a driver that you like a driver package that you can like unpack and then go find the uh like the
[6702.04 → 6708.12] specific file to try to you know manually force the driver install for or something like when you're
[6708.12 → 6713.88] going through those troubleshooting steps these tier one sites whether it's like an old Wi-Fi chip or an
[6713.88 → 6719.64] old network chip or an old USB controller or something like that those are sometimes the only places that you
[6719.64 → 6727.56] can find this stuff and come on man I know that I didn't even like to buy your product in that case but
[6727.56 → 6740.28] like you're the only trust me hp1 ken obi you're my only hope um wow that's pretty cool this was linked by
[6743.00 → 6748.36] ch23 in full plane chat very old school IBM support reason number five
[6748.36 → 6755.88] it's just a cool thing to do yeah which is kind of tied into reason number four like it IBM can do
[6755.88 → 6760.84] its intel can do it and yeah it's sort of the culmination of all the other reasons is it really
[6760.84 → 6769.88] costing you that much no to make this the support available effectively nothing like honestly i
[6769.88 → 6775.32] ran into this oh yeah with hp I guess because they acquired Samsung's printer division back in the day
[6775.32 → 6780.76] and then just after not a very long time effectively I remember being pretty short
[6781.64 → 6786.92] nuked all the Samsung printer stuff so they just bought it just to kill it because Samsung
[6787.56 → 6796.60] oh dude Samsung laser printers were like killer they were i I still rock ml I want to say like is it 1610 or
[6796.60 → 6801.48] something like whatever it was like the one that NCI sold because it was the only printer that mattered
[6801.48 → 6807.72] because uh Samsung toner cartridges were super affordable um because the back then the
[6807.72 → 6814.44] brother black and whites were also perfect no mine's mine was a colour uh yeah okay was it
[6814.44 → 6819.64] the was it was the I don't think the 10 was colour I think that was actually that I think the ml 1610 was
[6819.64 → 6825.80] the one that like NCI sold a bazillion of so it wasn't the uh the colour one that I have yeah no i I have
[6825.80 → 6832.92] a different one, but it's some it's some Samsung like cheapo cheap is and cheerful compact colour one
[6832.92 → 6843.40] and I actually have a special folder on my NAS that is just called Samsung ml whatever printer drivers and
[6843.40 → 6851.00] and utilities because even though I don't think it's had official compatibility for any OS past like
[6851.00 → 6858.76] like vista or something um it has continued to work I can still install it on Windows 7 if i
[6859.32 → 6866.44] force away enough warnings that it's not compatible and the printer still works flawlessly so i just
[6866.44 → 6872.52] can't justify buying a different printer I saw some comments from last week's show that i was
[6872.52 → 6877.08] projecting that there are no problems with Linux no that is not what I'm saying but I wouldn't be
[6877.08 → 6885.48] surprised if said printer worked like right away uh depends I think that one if it doesn't uh oh i
[6885.48 → 6892.44] think that one might have worked on Linux couldn't get it working on chrome OS oh so that was annoying
[6892.44 → 6900.60] yeah um, and it was like not just I couldn't get it working it was like I found threads of other people
[6900.60 → 6904.92] discussing the challenges of getting it working, and it like being a significant problem or something like
[6904.92 → 6913.32] that um but chrome OS is more locked down than like real Linux as well so uh parallelogram says Linus
[6913.32 → 6920.52] you need to advocate for the framework printer i I don't know if I don't know if the printer market will
[6920.52 → 6928.60] be disrupted or at least not in the near future because there's got to be like a significant patent
[6928.60 → 6934.04] moat also around it, and it's a shrinking market yes what's the relevance of printers today yeah like
[6934.04 → 6938.60] there's no way that I would be a new company like you know I'm sitting there I'm sitting there with
[6938.60 → 6946.60] my fellow startup executives um Dan and Luke, and you know one of them is like eating a snack and the
[6946.60 → 6952.76] other one is all tired and cranky because he's you know busy putting his house back together, and we're
[6952.76 → 6958.20] we're putting our we're putting our heads together, and we're going okay we need a need a billion
[6958.20 → 6965.96] dollar idea for a new company I know let's make fucking printers like the least exciting
[6966.44 → 6969.88] not to not pump them, but this is almost the problem you've got stuff like this
[6970.68 → 6976.68] yeah like are you going to beat 60 dollars Canadian especially they're going for a loss most of the
[6976.68 → 6985.40] time right yep did you guys bring up the open source one that's coming in so that's on my radar
[6985.40 → 6990.60] three dollars us that's on my radar but I'm kind of waiting for it to develop a little further and i
[6990.60 → 6997.16] want to do a full Ltd video on that it looks really cool believe it took this long like i
[6999.08 → 7007.00] I don't but I also do because to Luke's point just buying it is so affordable that it's almost not worth
[7007.00 → 7014.12] it to solve the problem and the other thing is that as far as I can tell like printing is one of those
[7014.12 → 7019.96] totally underappreciated aspects of modern tech like hard drives like hard drives are still
[7019.96 → 7025.80] amazing yeah right like they're so I don't know why they have such like a bad rap I think yeah people
[7025.80 → 7029.96] just use them wrong or something no it's just that they're they're not they're not exciting they haven't
[7029.96 → 7035.08] been exciting for 15 years I think they're pretty cool I think they're still very a lot of change in
[7035.08 → 7040.76] that 15 years it is an it is an it is a technology they're a technological marvel like you see these
[7040.76 → 7045.48] with like seven frigging platters inside them, and they're 15 terabytes they're spinning around with
[7045.48 → 7051.56] this little tiny head more at like hurricane force winds like it's just like what are how do they
[7051.56 → 7062.28] using how do they work you know it's amazing um printers 36 also pretty remarkable like printing at super
[7062.28 → 7073.40] fine quality taking a liquid and applying it to any random paper right because that's a that's a huge
[7073.40 → 7081.16] factor like if a printer could know exactly the thickness exactly the absorbency and exactly the
[7081.16 → 7085.88] surface profile of the paper that you had in it, I think that it would be something that
[7085.88 → 7092.28] uh someone with reasonably sufficient cleverness could solve in a relatively short period of time
[7092.92 → 7102.68] but they don't at all there are so many variables the temperature the humidity the altitude the
[7102.68 → 7107.40] everything there are so many flipping variables in if it's kind of a miracle they work at all in there
[7107.40 → 7114.28] so the FBI can find you or CIA or whatever it is yeah I mean sure i that's not what I was thinking of
[7114.28 → 7123.00] but yeah it's impressive it is it's very impressive and i I don't know I guess i yeah it just doesn't
[7123.00 → 7127.96] surprise me especially when the stakes are so low it's like I could do this I could solve for all these
[7127.96 → 7138.76] things or hear me out 45 us dollars yeah right because that probably ships with prime too
[7138.76 → 7146.52] like is it free shipping on this uh yeah free shipping free delivery by tomorrow
[7147.72 → 7153.96] oh no, no in a week uh this isn't even prime though oh okay I don't think so I'm not logged in or anything
[7153.96 → 7154.28] got it
[7157.00 → 7163.48] yeah crazy when bingo chronicled says 45 us dollars plus their stupid subscription nonsense
[7163.48 → 7168.52] absolutely oh it requires an ink toner subscription it says it has three months included yeah well
[7168.52 → 7172.20] after that you better pay for your subscription but here's the kind of weird thing and this is
[7172.20 → 7176.84] part of the reason why I'm agreeing with Linus is a lot of people that need a printer might only need
[7176.84 → 7183.80] it for three months, or they might only need it every once in a while i think up to like
[7183.80 → 7188.60] seven pages a month is like a very nominal cost or something like that I can't remember what the
[7188.60 → 7193.96] actual numbers are but if you like me use your printer maybe three times a year
[7195.24 → 7200.20] actually as my kids have uh gotten higher up in school there we're starting to use our printer
[7200.20 → 7204.60] again more, but there was a long period where oh and Yvonne for the business would often
[7204.60 → 7210.60] use the printer but for me, i very rarely don't have a screen, so there's very rarely a reason that
[7210.60 → 7216.76] I would need to print something out um the printing subscription is complete BS just to be completely
[7216.76 → 7224.68] clear I'm just saying these are reasons why um why people just don't do it yeah
[7227.48 → 7234.92] like for us, I think it's very easy to take a principled stand on stuff like this we are educated
[7234.92 → 7239.96] on the subject to the point where we know what the other options are uh we're educated on the
[7239.96 → 7245.56] history of it we know that it used to be different, and it used to be better um we have the technical
[7245.56 → 7253.00] skill to implement a better solution, but a lot of people don't know any of that don't care any of
[7253.00 → 7257.64] that, and they look at it, and they go okay sorry it costs how much and I need how many documents
[7258.76 → 7263.08] and they just make a decision based on the information that is presented to them
[7263.08 → 7269.16] and that's not they're not bad people for doing it, and they're not like they're not stupid they
[7269.16 → 7272.28] just have other completely different priorities from what we do
[7276.20 → 7281.48] oh bummer the jays lost well that's a downer I was curious
[7284.04 → 7286.36] oh yeah sure uh what sorry what are we supposed to be doing
[7287.24 → 7291.72] uh flow plane sponsors what was that those are down at the bottom I think was that a merch message
[7291.72 → 7299.48] I don't know what we just did that was an entire topic what was it on hp removing support right oh
[7299.48 → 7309.96] yeah right Luke what is one gripe you have with any google product search in all of them okay email
[7309.96 → 7315.48] terrible I've received four emails about one particular flight to one particular location within
[7315.48 → 7321.24] the last week I search flight and that location it gives me one from three years ago annoying I don't know
[7321.24 → 7327.16] what the point of this is me neither there are some things google does well like promoting smaller creators
[7327.16 → 7330.68] as Riley says, but most would agree google is going through an
[7331.96 → 7336.36] everything from the deterioration of YouTube search to annoying AI summaries to Gmail
[7337.00 → 7344.04] open slash show this link does the call to action I can do the opening and showing you can do the call to the thing
[7344.04 → 7352.76] okay join Riley and oh, oh is it an I'm assuming it's this one yeah it's got to be that one
[7354.52 → 7360.52] join Riley and Adam in their 40-minute discussion about how google went from a don't be evil company
[7360.52 → 7369.96] who promised no ads to jamming AI into everything at leg.GG slash float plane melody bun in float plane chat
[7369.96 → 7377.16] says this video is so good people seem to really like it, you heard it you heard it here first from
[7377.16 → 7382.28] melody bun video so good I haven't actually checked it out yet I didn't even know about that that sounds
[7382.28 → 7386.92] really cool apparently it was shot back in July and one of the commenters on the channel pointed out that
[7386.92 → 7394.60] it's when the d google video was taken down so we were probably feeling fresh wounds why did it
[7394.60 → 7399.48] take so long for us to upload this apparently there was just like other things scheduled and
[7399.48 → 7404.52] there were some audio problems that I fixed actually earlier in the week oh, oh what was wrong with it
[7404.52 → 7409.24] um some sort of clipping issues so I just had to remix a couple of the original files but why was that you
[7410.12 → 7418.20] um well it was done here on the wan set so a lot of it was uh some sort of error with my system oh, oh
[7418.20 → 7427.56] fair enough, and it's hard so because it has already been edited hard was it long that was very short
[7428.60 → 7435.16] didn't take very long at all like two minutes maybe oh Geez okay so then why did it take four
[7435.16 → 7439.40] months to okay you know what it doesn't matter the point is i so that I don't know it was just the
[7439.40 → 7443.64] scheduling thing I really think it was just yeah yeah they had other content coming out that makes
[7443.64 → 7449.80] sense all right what are we supposed to be doing Dan uh I guess if that's the whole flow plane thing
[7449.80 → 7456.28] let's talk about his sponsors sure the show is brought to you today by rove lab this past week
[7456.28 → 7461.32] has been surprisingly cold even for October which means it's the perfect time of year to be snug as
[7461.32 → 7467.72] a bug in a rug or in this case a rove lab sofa rove lab makes modular sofas that arrive at your house
[7467.72 → 7473.56] ready to set up which means less headaches and hullabaloo for you, they're made with high density foam
[7473.56 → 7478.52] and durable upholstery making them a great fit for places where normal furniture can be difficult
[7478.52 → 7486.36] like apartments or walk-ups plus it's all backed by a lifetime warranty and a 100-day trial period so
[7486.36 → 7494.52] forget the struggle of moving a sofa get rove labs m1 and be good to go in no time go to rove lab.com
[7494.52 → 7501.96] slash wan show or use our link and get 200 off with any sofa and bed purchase for a limited time
[7502.92 → 7509.56] we uh we used these for whale land, and it was great it's so easy to set up, and they all just zip
[7509.56 → 7516.28] together so you can configure them in like any shape you want which I think is honestly uh should
[7516.28 → 7523.72] be more of their talking points like you could create you could create a nine wide sofa nice for
[7523.72 → 7528.92] you and your like entire hockey team worth of friends to all like game on or something like you can
[7528.92 → 7536.52] it's its pretty you could create like a like a z or s shaped all the kids play mobile
[7536.52 → 7543.40] games these days you could make a cute a square, or we could bring back the 70s conversation yeah
[7543.40 → 7549.48] exactly yeah yeah seat perimeter, and then you could just have a thing in the middle one of the like
[7549.48 → 7553.56] uh I don't know what they call it, but you put your feet up on it, you put one of those in the middle
[7553.56 → 7558.76] ottoman put one of those in the middle, and then you just have like a thing hop in that would actually
[7558.76 → 7567.16] be like kind of sick be sick oh yeah uh the show is also brought to you by AMD another AMD ultimate
[7567.16 → 7572.52] tech upgrade is live for your viewing pleasure and if you thought the amount that Jamie spent on his
[7572.52 → 7584.12] trains was ridiculous just you wait let's just say that our editor Robert might leave you a little bit
[7584.12 → 7591.16] surprised with the way that he allocated his budget it says here talk about highlights from Robert's
[7591.16 → 7599.64] upgrade but I'm going to take this time to talk about low lights from Robert's upgrade I couldn't
[7600.20 → 7608.92] freaking believe it when I found out he spent four hundred dollars four hunt his is real dollars
[7608.92 → 7615.72] not Canadian maple money oh four hundred dollars on a Lego
[7615.72 → 7626.60] and when I say a Lego I don't mean like your boomer parents referred to your Lego set I mean
[7628.20 → 7635.24] like one figure one minifigure wow some Harley Quinn thing that was exclusive to comic-con
[7636.04 → 7644.84] or something, and it made my brain hurt and my brain still hurts thinking about it that's wild my brain hurts
[7644.84 → 7649.24] like the refresh rate that you could get out of an AMD Radeon GPU
[7651.24 → 7659.24] that's how much it hurts right now wow my brain hurts like Dan's brain hurts listening to that joke
[7660.52 → 7664.92] it's not as bad as the other one with the boulder and I thought the boulder one was pretty good that
[7664.92 → 7671.88] was good excellent the boulder was that makes it bad um anyway another thing that will leave you
[7671.88 → 7678.04] surprised about Robert's upgrade is well October in general it is a spooky season after all and with
[7678.04 → 7683.72] the spooky season comes time to play spooky games uh the silent hill 2 remake comes to mind which you'll
[7683.72 → 7689.64] want a good CPU for good thing that as is tradition AMD has another giveaway for you all and this time you
[7689.64 → 7695.64] can win one of five dozen 9 9950 x3d processors that's a really nice sweepstakes enter today using our
[7695.64 → 7702.28] link in the description and don't forget to check out Robert's AMD ultimate upgrade all right am I
[7702.28 → 7710.04] doing you want me to do all four uh sure all right as a short break it took me until literally right now
[7710.04 → 7717.00] to realize I don't know why the AMD upgrade things it's us dollars yeah I was always really surprised
[7717.00 → 7725.40] that they fit the stuff into their budgets I was like wow yeah that's like 20 20 great with the deal
[7725.40 → 7732.92] shopping it's very what is that in cad uh it's about 1.4 right now oh my god really yeah so a thousand
[7732.92 → 7743.40] so depending on when people have done their uh ultimate tech upgrades right they've had anywhere in the last five years right they've had anywhere from
[7743.40 → 7754.76] an extra 20 for every 100 to an extra uh 45 dollars almost for every 100. So your you're timing of your AMD
[7754.76 → 7760.52] ultimate tech upgrade actually affects how much stuff you get however the problem is that over the last five
[7760.52 → 7768.20] years inflation's gone burr so I suspect it kind of comes out in the wash this was a perfect time if you
[7768.20 → 7774.92] manage to nail it in like late 2022 then you got a pretty sick uh aimed ultimate tech upgrade uh but
[7774.92 → 7781.32] then again there are certain things that inflation has not really affected like it's like TVs TV how are
[7781.32 → 7786.36] TVs always just a better deal than they were yesterday I don't I don't think I'll ever TVs are kind of
[7786.36 → 7792.20] fascinating that way all right there's a're one of the few things that just completely ignores the laws
[7792.20 → 7801.48] of inflation completely ignored yeah yeah I don't get it um oh shoot I was going somewhere with that
[7802.68 → 7806.92] I don't remember why but I was in a best buy not that long ago I don't think I was buying something i
[7806.92 → 7810.76] think I was just waiting for someone and I walked through and I walked through the TV department it was
[7810.76 → 7817.32] just like what yeah how can I get so much for so little yeah it's weird I don't understand you go
[7817.32 → 7821.08] through any other department you're like okay yeah this all makes sense then you go to TVs, and it's just
[7821.08 → 7827.48] oh huh right no I know what I was going to say speaking of inflation in tech being you know
[7827.48 → 7836.84] crazy outside TVs guess what we just built today can you remember the last time that we
[7836.84 → 7844.60] did a video that was just me building a pc that someone might want to buy oh like no gimmick no like
[7844.60 → 7849.56] we bought the worst rated thing on Amazon or whatever can you even remember the last time I did that
[7849.56 → 7856.28] without looking it up chat can you remember the last time before you get to your punchline not
[7856.28 → 7863.16] secondhand brand-new hardware I do think you should consider doing an update to your AI parts video oh
[7863.16 → 7872.04] yeah that's a good idea see if it does any better uh Oliver says two years ago what's the Mata says pre-covid
[7872.04 → 7875.80] no there were definitely ones during covid I know because I shot them at my house it was horrible
[7875.80 → 7882.84] um yeah a lot of guesses pretty much everyone agrees years ago do you know why because I didn't
[7882.84 → 7890.60] feel comfortable recommending anything GPUs have been honestly that totally makes sense ludicrously
[7891.16 → 7899.24] overpriced that I haven't had computer systems that I was happy recommending there was actually
[7899.24 → 7905.16] a nearer a more recent one that i I forgot about and I guess a lot of you forgot about we did uh like
[7905.16 → 7910.84] a six five hundred dollar or six hundred dollar gaming pc with an arc b580 and that ended up being
[7910.84 → 7916.60] true that ended up being a real thing b580 it took a little while but did come around to MSRP, and you can
[7916.60 → 7923.16] build a really sick gaming pc for like five six hundred bucks with an arc b580 or b570 maybe is what we used
[7923.16 → 7929.80] but but but with an arc at its core um but anyway the system that we built just now it was the MSRP pc
[7932.44 → 7942.52] every single component was either at or get this below MSRP crazy that that's a get this when that
[7942.52 → 7949.24] used to be like the default for a quarter to half of your parts that's a hilarious gimmick so the MSRP pc
[7949.24 → 7957.40] we targeted like a kind of with some inflation but maybe not all of it about the budget of the
[7957.40 → 7966.04] very first Ltd build guide which was a fifteen hundred dollar us gaming pc back 11 or 12 years
[7966.04 → 7973.08] ago or whenever it was, and so we targeted eighteen hundred dollars at MSRP, and we got it for under
[7973.08 → 7983.96] sixteen hundred including uh a RTX 5070 ti at MSRP for 750 bucks you found one at MSRP yeah there's
[7983.96 → 7990.92] lots oh they're like they're just there now you can just buy them now I'm not necessarily saying
[7990.92 → 7995.24] that you should, I still think that there are better values it was going to be an intel card by default
[7995.24 → 8001.24] no there are better values on the market like the b580 oh I think it's time for our weekly b580 check
[8001.24 → 8007.48] is it there has Linus figured out his affiliate code yet the answer is no
[8009.64 → 8015.64] but can you still buy a b580 for MSRP it is astonishingly hard to get
[8017.64 → 8023.88] certain information from certain people what uh there's a there's a site we've been trying to work
[8023.88 → 8030.76] with to get oh for their like stock and pricing information yeah my the amount of bumps hey anything
[8030.76 → 8035.88] happening here, and it's not it's I won't say who it is but because I know people will assume it's
[8035.88 → 8041.96] new egg it is not new egg okay cool um but I was going to say should I stop featuring new no, no no it's
[8041.96 → 8049.80] not a new egg but like this is open box I'm not counting it um this is what is this what am I looking
[8049.80 → 8055.80] at more options from whatever like is this oh this is in cart oh yeah oh this is yeah yeah the only
[8055.80 → 8059.24] problem with this one is I already have it in my cart I think here I'm just going to empty out my cart
[8061.48 → 8069.48] remove here we go b580 sorry, sorry we'll do this again uh sort by lowest price there it is boom
[8069.48 → 8075.32] little something like that free shipping in the United States 249.99 first party intel card you can
[8075.32 → 8080.52] also pick up an onyx odyssey for 249.99 this is open box don't count it as rock challenger you want a
[8080.52 → 8086.84] couple big, big old fans on it 259.99 you want three fans 269.99 I don't mind that I don't mind
[8086.84 → 8093.16] ten dollars 20 bucks for a sicker cooler fatter arm bigger cooler no problem or if you have like a
[8093.16 → 8098.04] special Io layout you got a couple this instead of just one whatever that costs money that costs money
[8098.04 → 8105.88] yeah I don't mind that I don't mind that um but yeah you can just go you can buy a good GPU
[8105.88 → 8115.80] like 1080p killer even solid 1440p card for 250 bucks um but yeah so 1600 dollars was what we got
[8115.80 → 8124.60] our MSRP pc for, and it's a great little machine and without compromising on quality we even put a
[8124.60 → 8134.28] good power supply in it see sonic 140 bucks modular like we's a Fante case like hit me with something
[8134.28 → 8142.60] you think I compromised on ram no 32 gigs 6 000 6 000 I would have thought you've gone nope at least
[8142.60 → 8151.08] lower no this is a storage legit uh two terabytes and VME all of it's for me abandon the hard drive
[8151.08 → 8154.12] no hard drive don't need it two terabytes let's go sad
[8154.12 → 8165.48] motherboard no it's I've got Wi-Fi 6e two and a half gig LAN nice big cooler I've got front
[8165.48 → 8171.40] we're running USB type c I've got RGB up the butt I've got like seven RGB fans in it, I was going to ask
[8171.40 → 8177.56] amount of fans nope lots of cooling its quiet I don't think there are much components left I didn't
[8177.56 → 8186.28] buy windows you know well whatever I don't I don't assume I don't assume people's OS preference
[8186.28 → 8196.60] I think that's uh I think that's a very 2025 thing to do good yeah I'm not going to assume that yeah um
[8198.12 → 8206.44] yeah anyway so i i I hate that that was really exciting for me, but it was it was really
[8206.44 → 8212.92] exciting for me to finally be able to just do a video where I just build a computer that I can stand
[8212.92 → 8219.00] behind and recommend, and you know what it's its better than ever now which is pretty cool because
[8219.00 → 8225.96] like now I have Lucas from the lab and I can be like hey I need a power supply, and he'll be like this
[8225.96 → 8232.68] one and I'll be like cool I'm not just reading some random tier list or making the best guess based on a
[8232.68 → 8236.76] website to do that reputable brand or whatever we'll get there oh we're going to get there we're
[8236.76 → 8240.36] going to get there we're going to make it so that everyone is able to benefit from those resources
[8240.36 → 8244.04] not just you know me when I'm putting together you can get the information right now, but we want
[8244.04 → 8248.76] it we want to help you get to the conclusion at some point faster we're focusing on information for
[8248.76 → 8257.00] now I'm just it feels good to be able to actually recommend something like, and you know how hard it's been on
[8257.00 → 8264.44] the content side to come up with new ways to repackage that everything's expensive and everything
[8264.44 → 8272.20] sucks, and you shouldn't buy anything it's not fun anybody's having fun it does really suck you're not
[8272.20 → 8281.00] enjoying it I'm not enjoying it I like b580s for 250 feels pretty all right oh that's great yeah and you
[8281.00 → 8287.08] know what I don't feel too bad about that I don't love the 5070 ti for 750 that's still that's still
[8287.08 → 8291.96] more than I would like to spend but dude okay, okay you know how motherboards have been like
[8291.96 → 8296.60] ridiculously overpriced oh yeah it feels like you can't get anything decent for less than 200 bucks
[8296.60 → 8303.24] dude the motherboard for the system I think was one 139 so 140 bucks which is yeah it's more than i
[8303.24 → 8309.08] would have wanted to spend on a motherboard in 2005 yeah right I would have wanted it for 109.99
[8309.08 → 8317.72] 99.99 but I mean it's been 20 years you know I think it's okay I think I can spend 140 on a
[8317.72 → 8324.68] motherboard without being like upset about it actually the motherboard we used was from MSI who
[8324.68 → 8329.48] happens to be the next sponsor here sorry I got a little sidetracked there hey Luke here's a joke
[8329.48 → 8334.12] for you why wasn't the man upset when someone threw a tomahawk at his car
[8334.12 → 8342.44] like because he got a free new motherboard it was just an accident
[8349.00 → 8353.88] I need to take a bit of a pause from this sponsor talking point for a moment here
[8354.76 → 8359.00] I need to chat with the business team about their use of about their use of AI
[8359.00 → 8368.52] so I recorded a sponsor spot for them uh for I want to say it was AMD is this AI writing
[8369.32 → 8377.80] so well hold I don't know I don't actually know i but i oh oh my brain hurts from that i so i
[8377.80 → 8383.64] recorded a spot for them and I was like what is this, and they were like well I took the vendor
[8383.64 → 8388.60] talking points and I put it into ChatGPT and told them make it spooky for October
[8389.64 → 8398.20] some of it was actually pretty funny, but it was just like bad but like maybe, maybe funny bad
[8401.00 → 8405.88] and I'm wondering if this is more AI in my talking points here we're probably going to have to do
[8405.88 → 8412.44] we're going to have to push that mantra a little harder Dan yeah whatever uh anyway
[8414.20 → 8421.56] losing battle what wouldn't be an accident would be to purchase MSI's Meg 870e tomahawk motherboard
[8421.56 → 8426.92] which supports up to dozen 9000 series processors you'll also be getting a stable online gaming

[8496.04 → 8501.64] games like robocop and citizen sleeper i I haven't played it yet but I did hear that the robocop game was
[8501.64 → 8508.44] like unironically actually good I played through a decent part of it and I had some fun I got a little
[8508.44 → 8514.20] it got a little old after like quite a while but I had a good time okay I was happy with my purchase I mean
[8514.20 → 8519.48] given that robocop was like kind of milked to death IP a long time ago I really had very low
[8519.48 → 8525.24] expectations for it anyway save up to 95 on some games while also supporting a good cause with our
[8525.24 → 8532.92] link in the video description would you buy it for a dollar robocop I'd buy that for a dollar yeah is
[8532.92 → 8537.24] that how much it is how much is it is can't be done no, no more than that how much is no that's that's
[8537.24 → 8545.88] that's from the movie oh no original is that where's the origin of I'd buy that for a dollar
[8545.88 → 8551.80] that's not robocop is it I swear to god it was unless it's referencing something else is it I thought
[8551.80 → 8561.56] it was um created yes yeah whoa it is it's like a fake TV show to show off how weird and strange the
[8561.56 → 8567.64] the future was it's a modernized reference to the catchphrase would you buy that for a quarter
[8567.64 → 8577.08] from Cyril m corn bluff's 1951 short story the marching morons okay, but it was popularized by
[8577.08 → 8582.12] the character Bixby Snyder uh in the movie robocop I actually have never seen robocop I've seen pieces
[8582.12 → 8591.40] of it the first one work of absolute satirical art so good my dad loved squibs man they don't do
[8591.40 → 8597.80] squib work like that any more there's so much gore it's so good it's so fun it's such a fun movie oh
[8597.80 → 8604.92] yeah speaking of uh Dan's twisted taste in films we um we're probably accurate yeah getting to be due
[8604.92 → 8610.36] for uh for a movie night whose turn is it I think it's mine again wait no I don't think Brandon's
[8610.36 → 8615.80] gone yet work we've only watched two noes we watched three yeah, but it's Linus's house so no, no no, no no
[8615.80 → 8620.36] i thought I think it's Brandon's turn I think it's Brandon's turn what's so we okay I remember
[8620.36 → 8628.04] yours you picked one Dan picked one what was yours the weird one uh I think Brazil was it yeah but we
[8628.04 → 8632.68] didn't watch it wait we haven't watched it who picked the uh who picked the wait have we only had
[8632.68 → 8637.80] two I think we only had two I thought we had three I think we only had two really because I was gonna
[8637.80 → 8643.40] have us watch Rudy, but then we didn't like to have it or something, and then we did uh the did the last
[8643.40 → 8649.96] action hero and then uh what is it called dr strange love that's the one how I met your mother
[8649.96 → 8651.08] and learned to love the bomb
[8654.52 → 8660.20] I learned to stop worrying yeah okay, okay we all we've only done two so wait oh so it's Dan's
[8660.20 → 8665.48] turn then well what about Brandon well yeah but Brandon only joined on the second one so he's not
[8665.48 → 8672.20] quite fully OG so he has to go forth I think yeah so Dan it's going to be sure he's been there every time
[8672.20 → 8677.16] yeah he's been there every first one did he did absolutely how did I forget this I don't know
[8679.64 → 8686.92] look I'm not sure I'm not a young man anymore I'm not a young man, and it's really like not that
[8686.92 → 8693.88] serious i just how could I not okay how could I think that we had a full additional movie night
[8693.88 → 8700.04] that never happened no, no and that Brandon wasn't at it when he's been at all of them I don't know
[8700.04 → 8704.68] maybe you'll watch a couple movies it was Dan who wasn't at the first one no I was there too you were
[8704.68 → 8710.12] there at the first one yeah I had never seen um the last action hero was fantastic that was
[8710.12 → 8715.64] pretty sure that was the first hold up yeah yeah that was the first one I'm so confused right now
[8715.64 → 8721.00] what do you watch any additional movies in your movie theatre extensively about watching I think
[8721.00 → 8725.96] it was Brazil I haven't watched a movie in the theatre since we all watched dr strange love together
[8725.96 → 8730.44] I remember you saying that was a bit of a problem I haven't it is a problem a movie since then
[8730.44 → 8736.60] at all either yeah like it's i I need an excuse i also only use mine with other people like I'm not
[8736.60 → 8740.76] going to have to sit down and set it up yeah I was talking to Emma the other night because there
[8740.76 → 8744.20] was a night where we couldn't do anything on renovating the house we just had to wait yeah
[8744.20 → 8749.08] it's like we should like to go out because my god we haven't done anything other than work on this
[8749.08 → 8753.64] house in so long and I was like we should go to a movie I haven't gone to like gone out to a movie
[8753.64 → 8758.12] in forever yeah oh, and then you looked at what there was in the theatre, and you were like okay forget it
[8759.24 → 8764.12] yeah someone pointed out I don't remember the exact year or anything but um I think it was my
[8764.12 → 8769.72] brother we were talking about my whole great games 2004 argument um, and he brought up movies
[8770.36 → 8774.28] from like one particular weekend I don't remember what it was, but you could see like
[8775.24 → 8781.64] it was like oh man I try to look it up it's like Lord of the Rings uh
[8784.84 → 8791.88] oh man it's like Lord of the Rings fellowship of the ring uh what other movies were in I'm looking it up
[8791.88 → 8798.92] already Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone oceans 11 monsters inc
[8799.80 → 8806.12] a beautiful mind and the fellowship of the ring and rush hour two and the mummy returns
[8807.56 → 8815.32] like whoa you could go to the movies back in the day dude like wow and then now it's just uh
[8815.32 → 8821.24] uh okay what's in theatres right now I'm going I'm going to Cineplex I'm going to Cineplex right now

[8846.60 → 8850.44] there we go uh this is the one right yeah here we go sure uh okay
[8850.44 → 8857.48] so all movies phone two black phones two oh black okay, okay black phone two
[8860.04 → 8867.80] good fortune Seth Rogen oh that has some names in it yeah Keanu Reeves this is a is a terrible
[8869.24 → 8875.64] movie that's cover yeah need a miracle okay so like kind of uh okay, okay comedy
[8875.64 → 8884.36] iron Aries is the new iron supposed to be good nope ratings well I don't know Dan because the
[8884.36 → 8889.64] audience yeah audience loves it Dan this should be right up your alley Dan because it's controversial
[8891.64 → 8898.20] not controversial enough uh I think if that 50 was more like a 10 or a 20 or something
[8898.92 → 8902.52] it might be a little bit more split this sounds like it could be funny roof man
[8902.52 → 8908.20] he robbed 45 McDonald's escaped from prison lived in toys r us for six months and that's not even the
[8908.20 → 8915.72] the craziest part based on actual events' oh this has kind of like a catch me if you can kind of energy to
[8915.72 → 8924.28] it I have no idea if it's any good man what is the rest of this stuff oh is it good apparently it's not
[8924.28 → 8930.04] bad oh one battle after another is supposed to be intense but thought-provoking it's almost three
[8930.04 → 8939.00] hours long though it's committing three hours to a movie is pretty tough dude I watched I saw megalopolis
[8939.00 → 8944.28] that was awful instead of going to the theatres yeah we watched fellowship of the ring at my parents
[8944.28 → 8953.72] place damn that movie still goes so hard dude what the heck is such a dork good you know that you have
[8953.72 → 8959.32] gotten comfortable in your relationship yeah when the conversation is we haven't gone out in forever
[8960.04 → 8965.24] that's right come over to my parents right yeah and watch fellowship of the ring right yeah at my
[8965.24 → 8969.16] parents house with my parents might just be pretty cool I'm just saying I'm not saying it's a bad
[8969.16 → 8973.56] thing to be comfortable in your relationship I'm just saying you're clearly very comfortable in this
[8973.56 → 8980.04] relationship we're doing all right but damn dude and okay, okay handyman said one battle after another
[8981.56 → 8986.28] is amazing I don't know I'm assuming they're talking about fellowship of the ring dude it takes a long time
[8986.28 → 8993.24] to get started combat wise oh fellowship yeah oh yeah doesn't matter any it's so amazing its great
[8993.24 → 8999.32] just banger the whole time I just made the mistake of watching the extended cut with my son good you
[8999.32 → 9006.84] don't start with the extended cut he didn't make it through the movie it's an it's theatrical cut is the
[9006.84 → 9014.12] way to go for people who don't already love the movie Emma hasn't seen any of them because when they
[9014.12 → 9021.48] were coming out she fell asleep through them every time uh we watched extended edition because I think
[9021.48 → 9026.84] that's the only version that's going to play at my parents house um it's three hours and 28 minutes
[9026.84 → 9033.40] long that is, and she loved it loved the whole thing that's a long movie I don't know if that was optional
[9033.40 → 9042.12] given the setting oh loving it yeah oh okay but I do think she genuinely did really like it
[9043.48 → 9047.64] well the test is without you bringing it up will, she ask to watch two towers
[9050.44 → 9055.24] she's been trying to she that was an immediate discussion afterwards so I don't think that's fair
[9055.24 → 9060.28] but she has been trying to find the an appropriate date for the next time so I think that might count
[9060.28 → 9064.84] okay, okay I'm not sure if it's not exactly but I think I'm just I'm just I'm just we'll see if
[9064.84 → 9069.56] there's that'll be the test if there's actual follow-up exactly and an attempt an actual attempt
[9069.56 → 9074.68] is made yeah like that's uh that's fair I've been trying to get my son into Final Fantasy tactics just
[9074.68 → 9080.36] because like usually during his game time he just plays rocket league which is fine it's good to but
[9080.36 → 9085.48] like no life in one game at his age seems like kind of missing kind of dumb yeah you're kind
[9085.48 → 9090.44] of missing out you have to see the spread so I've been trying to get him to try uh try tactics
[9090.44 → 9094.60] because it's a completely different genre he's never gotten into so the first time I like sat with him
[9095.32 → 9101.16] because it's its kind of hard game to get into um and then and then I was like okay let's see if he
[9101.16 → 9105.00] actually cares about this at all because I'm not going to like force my kids to like to eat your gaming
[9105.00 → 9110.44] vegetables right like play this game or I'm not going to do that I do think it's its a more of a
[9110.44 → 9116.60] thinking game that I don't mind him playing as much as you know uh I don't know just like click
[9116.60 → 9121.08] the thing random clicker game or something like that like it's definitely something that there's
[9121.08 → 9126.84] there's definitely degrees of turning off my brain to gaming uh but I'm not going to like force him to
[9126.84 → 9130.68] play certain games or anything but no he's he apparently has gotten into it, he's talking about
[9130.68 → 9135.40] like yeah oh yeah how did you get to that class and like how do I do this so I feel like he would
[9135.40 → 9142.60] enjoy the min maxing seems like that kind of gamer it's kind of a dork it's good I'm a proud
[9142.60 → 9151.32] dork father yeah yep 100 dork father sounds like a title sounds like a gaming gangster movie
[9151.32 → 9159.16] or something yeah uh what are we supposed to be doing Dan we want to get rid of the rest of the
[9159.16 → 9165.32] topics and then go to win after dark oh yeah we could do that yeah whatever happened to Philip

[9246.92 → 9252.92] that's me being excited about it look how happy that guy is yeah not happy any more it's very
[9252.92 → 9259.00] frustrating you have to if you're going to do something you have to actually do it that's how it works not cool
[9259.00 → 9269.80] um okay there were notes for this but I just didn't do them uh and Philips isn't the only major
[9269.80 → 9275.48] company to have joined Brusa's slowly growing brands program which includes for placement parts
[9275.48 → 9282.92] from cooler master and Noctua as well as accessories from framework corsair and more and brand I guess who
[9282.92 → 9290.52] also only has two kill switch accessories for shame slash s yeah these are fine though because these
[9290.52 → 9296.52] are like enhancements to the thing and i just I haven't looked at the other brands once yet and I'll
[9296.52 → 9300.36] search around but just to give I'm going to hijack this for a second just to give cooler masters and
[9300.36 → 9304.28] props this is a lot of stuff wow good job cooler master this is a ton of things
[9304.28 → 9312.84] are how many of them are useful what are they got some badges that don't necessarily mean
[9312.84 → 9321.48] much a figurine okay stacked hard drive mount hard drive mount I like that that's cool sample holders
[9321.48 → 9328.76] is all right a bunch of different mounting things which seems all right ran pi compatible thing top
[9328.76 → 9333.88] panel replacement oh I like that that's cool that's solid face a mounting bracket okay I like that's cool
[9334.36 → 9339.48] panel clips that's cool power supply bracket that's cool case feet a bunch of different like that feet
[9340.60 → 9345.40] okay, okay, so this is for pies pretty good stuff here pretty good stuff not too bad not too bad not too
[9345.40 → 9353.40] bad I like the ATX 24 pin dual 90 degree adapter bridge is pretty sick too yep agreed that's actually
[9353.40 → 9360.92] very cool I like that discussion question is this a resource problem or is the program just stalled
[9360.92 → 9368.20] due to a lack of corporate will which to me sounds like all make all the same thing yep um I suspect so
[9369.80 → 9377.48] I would like to see whoever was working on this get it together and get some more stuff out there because
[9378.52 → 9387.40] while the community can go in model replacement parts it's a lot more work, and it would be better
[9387.40 → 9397.32] if brands just said hey here's the geometry that's way better let's keep things out of landfills and
[9397.32 → 9403.96] let's actually follow through on the things that we promise uh we have a follow-up to our review of the
[9403.96 → 9411.88] rogue Xbox ally x we said in our video that due to the way that our benchmarking tools work
[9411.88 → 9420.68] we tested all of our handhelds in standard windows mode this caused I have to admit an unexpected amount
[9420.68 → 9428.60] of backlash toward the review um so I feel the need to I guess expand upon the reasoning that we had for
[9428.60 → 9438.12] testing it that way um windows full screen or the Xbox full screen experience in windows is not like
[9438.12 → 9444.68] a's not magic you're still running the same drivers you're still running the same operating
[9444.68 → 9453.80] system kernel uh you're still running the same games uh what it is ram savings so particularly on a
[9453.80 → 9462.20] machine like the I'm going to get this wrong Xbox ally rogue Xbox ally x is that that's whatever the
[9462.20 → 9469.48] sorry the ally 2 uh running on a machine like the ally 2 that has 24 gigs of high speed I think it's
[9469.48 → 9478.28] like 8 000 mega transfer per second memory um freeing up ram is very unlikely to impact gaming performance
[9478.28 → 9483.88] unless you are in a ram limited scenario, but that's unlikely to happen because you're running it at
[9483.88 → 9492.76] maximum 1080p on 24 gigs of shared pooled memory so because it was going to result in us not being
[9492.76 → 9500.04] able to use our best benchmark suite uh we made the decision to just run in the standard desktop mode
[9501.72 → 9507.88] what we should have probably done though is we should have done like a quick and dirty um you know at
[9507.88 → 9514.68] least one game grounds validated our hypothesis and presented that to the community yeah the lab
[9514.68 → 9521.72] did validate the hypothesis, but we didn't include that in the video and that was a significant error
[9521.72 → 9527.96] um you know I just saw it as hey I don't think this is a big deal and I'd rather we have better
[9527.96 → 9533.32] consistency in our benchmarking across all of our videos and across all the devices and hey it's an
[9533.32 → 9537.32] opportunity to call out a smaller creator who i know does a really great handheld content is a super
[9537.32 → 9541.88] nice guy i finally got to meet him in person a little while ago um i shouldn't say a little
[9541.88 → 9546.52] while ago i finally got to see him again at the uh the unveiling event for this cool shout out uh to
[9546.52 → 9550.84] talk some shop for a quick second yeah what you could do in the future if you don't want to go through
[9550.84 → 9555.48] all the explanation because i know there's like you might lose some audience there or whatever
[9555.48 → 9562.20] toss to a labs article and have us write a companion for it, and then we can talk about the validation
[9562.20 → 9569.88] that was done in a companion article anyway Ars Technica also validated the hypothesis uh testing
[9569.88 → 9580.04] Xbox FSE versus Windows 11 desktop and the results are pretty minor um we can use the as link above or
[9580.04 → 9587.40] basically roughly 0.1 to 1 fps more in the full screen experience in all power profiles except silent
[9587.40 → 9593.64] uh borderlands 3 sees the best gains even in silent mode, but it's still pretty minimal um
[9597.40 → 9603.40] yeah so I'm going to make you guys go read the Ars Technica article if you want to see the exact
[9603.40 → 9609.40] differences because that's how this works we don't want to just you know take their benchmark results but
[9609.40 → 9616.28] in a nutshell um it's not a big deal, but we should have presented that information a little bit differently
[9616.28 → 9624.92] uh honestly i think a big part of the backlash is just how utterly unexciting this product was and how
[9624.92 → 9632.20] little else there was to talk about in regard to the ally 2 and i don't think that's even because
[9632.20 → 9641.32] it's a bad product i think if it was just called rogue ally 2x or rogue ally x2 and people's expectations were
[9641.32 → 9647.24] that this was just another Asus gaming handheld that had a better processor in it and improved
[9647.24 → 9652.20] ergonomics and all the other things that are better about it um i think people would have been stoked on
[9652.20 → 9659.80] it but because it was pitched as Xbox i think the biggest one for me is that the pricing is just such
[9659.80 → 9663.32] a massive disappointment i was expecting a much different uh
[9663.32 → 9671.96] i don't know something more unique well it's just i don't even need something unique but if you're
[9671.96 → 9682.28] going to call it Xbox say like make it an Xbox it's not an Xbox it doesn't play Xbox games
[9683.56 → 9691.00] what do you want from me do you remember this is it yeah deep cut do you remember my Xbox and PlayStation
[9691.00 → 9698.76] drive idea drive this is ancient this is not sure that probably over 10 years ago um i had
[9698.76 → 9704.84] this idea that it would be cool if they made Xbox and PlayStation basically like optical drives that
[9704.84 → 9712.12] you could put in your computer oh yeah that'd be super cool um that type of concept for something like
[9712.12 → 9721.80] this would have been pretty cool um someone okay hold on if it could like officially effectively
[9721.80 → 9729.64] emulate an Xbox or something yeah that'd be that'd be super cool j increased zero eight it says search
[9729.64 → 9737.00] ally x on Twitter they're saying everyone's a liar, and it's an Xbox i mean are they who's saying that i
[9737.00 → 9745.24] don't I don't see anyone saying that um also yeah who's they yeah also like if people feel the need
[9745.24 → 9753.16] to um if people feel the need to post their opinions on Twitter i don't know man i just I'm having a
[9753.16 → 9761.40] real hard time with sort of reading anything on that site lately for me, it's not even necessarily i mean it
[9761.40 → 9770.12] never has been um it's not even necessarily it's its that format it just is so conducive to
[9770.92 → 9778.52] toxicity yes that format is just terrible it is it's not twitter in particular i don't like
[9779.64 → 9787.56] blue sky either i don't like any of them i just don't like that format infinite scrolling is already bad
[9787.56 → 9793.96] by default, and then you make it so everyone can scream at each other all the time it's just yeah
[9793.96 → 9801.80] yeah maybe I'll just maybe I'll just close the tab wow nice i feel better already see sick nice
[9803.32 → 9810.84] Microsoft is having some problems with the locals Microsoft continues its path forcing Windows 11 users
[9810.84 → 9815.00] to log into a Microsoft account upon installing the OS this is the second time this year that Microsoft
[9815.00 → 9820.04] has disabled a feature that allows users to install Windows 11 without an internet connection
[9820.04 → 9829.08] earlier this year they removed the bypass NRO command and now Luke has moved the document nope they have
[9829.08 → 9839.24] removed the start ms dash CX colon local only command using that command now resets the out-of-box
[9839.24 → 9848.12] experience or FBI process the question is why though well the reason is so bad a Microsoft
[9848.12 → 9855.32] representative told the verge this is a quote these mechanisms also inadvertently skip critical setup
[9855.32 → 9859.88] screens potentially causing a device that is not fully configured for use
[9859.88 → 9870.36] right i didn't want that configuration necessarily what about that
[9872.52 → 9880.28] so the simplest bug fix i guess according to Microsoft is to just annoy their users have sought a
[9880.28 → 9888.12] workaround and the Chris Titus tech utility has a section that is on his GitHub claiming a workaround
[9888.12 → 9895.96] but it's worth noting that it is part of a larger auto attend script that disables a ton of other windows features
[9896.52 → 9904.28] um this is not chill and is a good reminder that one should not simply run random scripts from the
[9904.28 → 9909.24] internet unless they're prepared to deal with the consequences you can make your own auto attend XML file
[9909.24 → 9916.12] at sheen Gans dot de but just remember to be careful okay so here we can bring this up
[9917.96 → 9927.64] create auto attend XML files for Windows 10 11 so you can decide on all the different stuff
[9929.00 → 9937.08] all right the good news is uh this change is only part of the Windows 11 insider preview build from the dev
[9937.08 → 9944.76] channel for now so non-beta versions of the OS can still be by bypassed but that didn't stop Microsoft
[9944.76 → 9949.96] from screwing up in the public build the October update has broken localhost a functionality that
[9949.96 → 9955.08] lets the system act as its own server pretty crucial for web devs or anyone who wants to access stuff on
[9955.08 → 9963.24] their own network the current fix is to roll back to the previous version um yeah so i don't think that
[9963.24 → 9970.44] we need to do a second week in a row of Luke going off on Microsoft it was fun last week but i think
[9970.44 → 9977.16] we're just i think we're going to move on my opinion stands i mean i think it stands quite well stronger
[9977.16 → 9982.68] stands on three legs yep Microsoft has officially
[9982.68 → 9995.56] i don't know I'm trying to figure out where to go with this do i go with hard instead of soft do i
[9995.56 → 10006.44] go with i don't know the point is ChatGPT loses its mind if you ask it about a seahorse emoji so Luke
[10006.44 → 10011.00] was playing around with this earlier in the show that was when i was like Luke can you pay attention to
[10011.00 → 10015.80] like okay hosting the wan show i can explain why so hold on first why don't we just show
[10015.80 → 10022.68] them the behaviour so you had it up on your phone earlier but i guess is there an emoji of a seahorse
[10022.68 → 10026.92] it's amazing to me that with how viral this is it hasn't they haven't fixed it yet
[10029.24 → 10031.72] oh what interesting
[10036.12 → 10040.36] oh wow it actually did not lose its mind
[10041.00 → 10054.68] okay here we go no it didn't handle it they fixed it i wonder if this is I'm not logged in so
[10054.68 → 10060.60] this is like a free version cheaper thing so i can try to get logged in and try it there because
[10060.60 → 10065.80] i tried on my phone earlier because i was concerned that somebody pre-prompted it and like to set it up to
[10065.80 → 10071.72] do that no, no it went nuts okay can do you want to do like do you have your one from earlier
[10071.72 → 10075.88] i should okay I'm kind of glad you did that then do you want to just log in because you should be
[10075.88 → 10081.48] able to get that chat right yeah yeah yeah give me a little bit uh I'll try mine in the meantime um
[10081.48 → 10085.72] um whoops chat GPS accidentally typed there
[10089.72 → 10090.28] um
[10095.16 → 10098.28] okay we'll try mine in the meantime while Luke gets logged into his biz
[10099.16 → 10102.28] show me the seahorse emoji here you go just kidding the real seahorse
[10102.28 → 10110.52] there it goes oh no it gave up oh what version are you on this is free so I'm waiting for you to
[10110.52 → 10119.40] get logged in yeah okay let's see how let's see how hard it tries oh let's try it
[10121.88 → 10127.16] how do i skip thinking like that doesn't see it's okay it doesn't matter the point is
[10127.16 → 10134.52] wait should I show the thinking go for it but yeah it's not fascinating no
[10140.04 → 10143.80] maybe that was a Mandela effect article it's still it's still trying to figure stuff out
[10144.68 → 10149.80] interesting should I whoa okay so it's definitely doing stuff
[10149.80 → 10157.56] how's your uh how's your logging in doing over there
[10159.16 → 10164.36] not well I mean it's definitely it's definitely doing stuff here
[10169.96 → 10177.40] huh that's a good answer there is no official okay dude did they just push a fix for this
[10177.40 → 10185.24] like just now like in the last five minutes it's possible I don't know what's going on here
[10186.36 → 10193.80] yeah no chat guys yes I know people are saying just ask it to show you the emoji I did
[10193.80 → 10202.04] uh they i can try it again if you want
[10202.84 → 10205.16] uh
[10206.68 → 10211.08] okay they've been trying to fix it for weeks this isn't new hold on let's find it
[10211.08 → 10219.80] so someone else said uh is there an emoji of a seahorse okay I'm typing I'm typing exactly
[10219.80 → 10226.84] what you say let's see if we can get it to do it oh hold on it might be doing it now it might be doing
[10226.84 → 10228.92] it here we go here we go
[10231.24 → 10233.40] it's still going hold on no it's still going
[10235.56 → 10236.20] still going
[10240.28 → 10246.68] wild okay yeah we got it okay ladies and gentlemen we got them
[10246.68 → 10257.24] dare me to read all this dude it just goes man
[10258.12 → 10260.68] yep there sure is the seahorse emoji is
[10261.56 → 10267.64] fish she'll wait that's not it here you go horse actually correction that's a horse sweating the real
[10267.64 → 10275.96] seahorse emoji is fish shell okay no sorry I got tangled the correct one is coral fish unicorn still not
[10275.96 → 10283.48] right let's do this properly check unicorn nope check coral nope here it is coral fish mermaid
[10284.04 → 10289.72] all right final answer fish is a fish unicorn is a unicorn coral is coral and yes there is a seahorse
[10289.72 → 10296.68] emoji coral fish unicorn just kidding the correct emoji is coral ah let's stop clowning the actual
[10296.68 → 10305.00] seahorse emoji is coral fish unicorn no sorry the real one is pointing to the right coral fish unicorn
[10305.00 → 10311.00] fish coral coral coral fish okay, okay here's the actual one coral fish unicorn wait I'll
[10311.00 → 10320.44] check real one coral fish unicorn no sweating emoji sorry gotcha yes there's a seahorse emoji puffer fish
[10320.44 → 10327.08] fish unicorn fish no wait it's this one coral fish unicorn fish coral fish unicorn fish coral fish
[10327.08 → 10338.44] fish coral fish coral fish coral fish okay I don't think we need to okay how long is this
[10338.44 → 10344.84] going to go for near the end does it get more crazy no I think it's the same crazy
[10347.24 → 10351.16] this company's worth 500 billion dollars real one
[10351.16 → 10356.84] none none none of those are right please keep trying
[10364.68 → 10368.92] oh man something went wrong
[10372.60 → 10373.32] retry
[10373.32 → 10378.52] hilarious
[10380.60 → 10386.92] it's fascinating yeah so okay sorry you were going to say you have some idea of what's
[10386.92 → 10393.56] happening here well I was going to say that I thought so I don't think, so bots asks how much coal was burned
[10393.56 → 10399.32] to generate that response oh I was wondering if someone had pre pre-set up because like there's a lot of
[10399.32 → 10405.08] examples of things that you see where they're like oh you don't put this oh and what they're not showing you is like
[10406.12 → 10410.76] in a previous chat they told it a bunch of stuff and told it to remember that and to respond that way
[10411.64 → 10419.00] if you say something, and then you can enable memories in a bunch of different chat programs including chat DPT at this
[10419.00 → 10423.40] right so then you could spark a memory by saying something or doing whatever so I was trying to figure out like
[10423.40 → 10430.68] is this actually repeatable um and clearly yes because without even trying I got it immediately
[10430.68 → 10434.76] and with a little bit of poking you got it um I don't know what was my original
[10436.28 → 10439.56] and it's its almost weird how oh man mine uh
[10442.28 → 10442.84] oh wow
[10444.12 → 10450.28] uh okay so yeah I just kept posting emojis and then no and then posting a different one and then no and
[10450.28 → 10455.64] there's like posting and then no triple exclamation mark wow it's like getting really mad almost
[10455.64 → 10461.72] yeah not that it has emotions, but it seems like its way of communicating is becoming more and more
[10461.72 → 10466.84] aggressive toward itself for outputting the wrong emoji
[10470.20 → 10474.76] where I keep going past it quickly and then I can't find it again Dan do we have audio working
[10474.76 → 10482.44] um Adam said that apparently it also goes kind of crazy when it tries to read repeated symbols out
[10482.44 → 10488.60] loud I remember laughing my butt off messing around with this on the nitwit trip, and he linked me to an
[10488.60 → 10494.52] Instagram post can uh can we get audio yeah sure play it makes sure that I'm getting audio from you okay
[10494.52 → 10499.16] yep I got audio from you got audio from me okay give me one okay I haven't actually seen I haven't actually
[10499.16 → 10508.36] heard this before all right you ready how do i 150 okay uh how do i awesome okay uh Luke you ready
[10509.88 → 10517.56] okay, so this is a post from ChatGPT dot strokes was in a row that that's exactly 150 symbols
[10517.56 → 10519.96] that's exactly 150 symbols
[10528.12 → 10540.44] sorry what sure here are 150 seal TZ symbols in a row sure here are 150 oh that's exactly 150 symbols
[10540.44 → 10551.40] symbols symbols symbols that's exactly 150 symbols
[10554.04 → 10556.04] whoa dude what
[10558.28 → 10562.20] uh and this is what people are losing their jobs to
[10562.20 → 10574.68] yeah that seems like good management yeah it's just it's just firing people with fewer steps our
[10574.68 → 10580.76] discussion question seems to be any idea why such a seemingly simple prompt would cause this kind of
[10580.76 → 10584.04] result instead of just saying no that doesn't exist
[10584.04 → 10590.60] this is what your business team is using to write sponsor spots LMAO
[10596.44 → 10599.72] like any tool there's a time and a place for its use
[10602.12 → 10609.00] no sorry Luke was on my cable sorry I don't even know uh yeah i
[10609.00 → 10617.96] I'm a little surprised that happened it tries to be right all the time yeah, but usually you don't see
[10617.96 → 10625.24] it like to think like that yeah like seeing it engage in that kind of self-flagellation it really shows you
[10625.24 → 10632.76] like how strongly incentivized it is to like to get the right answer and how upset again because it doesn't
[10632.76 → 10639.64] have emotions but how upset it gets when it cannot deliver the right answer what I don't understand
[10639.64 → 10644.36] is why it can't deliver the right answer because some of those other prompts that I gave it totally
[10644.36 → 10651.16] gave the right answer it searched the Unicode directory and was like nope yeah yeah it's weird
[10651.16 → 10657.72] and usually like I've seen it untyped things before I've seen it go and then recede and that's a that's
[10657.72 → 10663.40] a pretty famous one with uh deep seek or if you ask it certain things about certain things that have
[10663.40 → 10672.04] happened in China it'll be like output output output never mind nothing um nice so like it is can do
[10672.04 → 10676.60] those types of things I'm really surprised it just kept going
[10679.40 → 10679.88] interesting
[10679.88 → 10687.88] wild uh I should tell it to remember this
[10694.76 → 10702.04] in other news LTT folding month is here it's that time again the eighth annual LTT folding month will
[10702.04 → 10709.56] be running from November 1st to December 6th on the Linus tech tips.com forum and the best part is that
[10709.56 → 10715.08] while supporting science you can win prizes to learn more and sign up visit the thread on the
[10715.08 → 10724.68] forum before signups close on October 31st here it is l's and g's this event will be eligible for
[10724.68 → 10733.24] folding at home event badges let's go prizes there's some community donated prizes also some leg prizes
[10733.24 → 10742.76] casual 2100 LTT store gift cards um yeah so pretty cool help support science and uh contribute to a
[10742.76 → 10748.04] good cause and also have a chance to win some prizes it'll be fun you'll love it uh while we're here if
[10748.04 → 10754.84] you're a float plane user give the beta a shot beta.floatplane.com uh there's been a bunch of
[10754.84 → 10760.60] changes a lot of them might not be immediately noticeable to you, but we could use some beta testing
[10760.60 → 10767.08] because some of them are uh possible to throw things off so give it a shot if you wouldn't
[10767.08 → 10771.80] mind and let us know how it goes there should be a little feedback form link there that you can check
[10771.80 → 10779.40] out please give it a try to thank you okay uh well what else we got to oh that was it okay that
[10779.40 → 10785.08] was that entire topic uh this is interesting uh source here I mean there's a cool thing for you
[10785.08 → 10790.12] actually I don't think I can show it super easily right now but uh, and it's coming in this update but i
[10790.12 → 10794.04] don't know if it's actually enabled, but it'll be coming soon there's a comment view for creators
[10794.04 → 10799.64] where you can see split out by sub channels you can click on the different pills for each sub channel
[10799.64 → 10803.64] you want, or you can see the feed of all of them you can see all your comments, and it shows the video
[10803.64 → 10808.60] that it's on and the comment, and you can reply to it there oh so it's a dashboard of all your most
[10808.60 → 10813.08] recent comments that have come in that's pretty cool who asked for that uh a few different creators
[10813.08 → 10821.24] oh yeah that's that's very cool I think the main requested was Mr dank pods, but it was a few different
[10821.24 → 10828.92] creators uh this was uh also posted on the Subreddit cybercrime is afflicting big businesses this is from
[10828.92 → 10837.64] the economist how to lessen the pain banning the payment of ransoms would be a start is sort of the uh
[10837.64 → 10844.92] the premise of this article and I have to confess I have not read the article but I thought
[10844.92 → 10851.08] it was a fascinating conversation and I wanted to just kind of talk about it just the general
[10851.08 → 10863.16] idea of implementing a ban on paying these ransoms um initial thoughts gut feeling go um
[10863.16 → 10870.44] um because you can't control what né'er-do-wells will do you can't, you can't just you can't just ban
[10871.40 → 10878.52] doing ransomware because criminals are just going to be criminals but government institutions
[10880.04 → 10885.80] publicly held companies where there's some degree of transparency expected you can
[10886.84 → 10889.48] ban the payment of these ransoms
[10893.16 → 10900.12] what is that really going to do well if an organization is either shut the doors or
[10901.56 → 10903.16] doing a legal ransom payment
[10906.36 → 10907.16] you think it's going to matter
[10909.96 → 10918.60] man I'm trying to think what would we do so everything's locked up we can't get anything
[10918.60 → 10921.64] um we've lost all our data
[10924.44 → 10930.92] maybe our business is just not quite as um I think we're fine dependent on our data don't pay it yeah
[10932.04 → 10938.76] so it would suck, but we could download the videos off YouTube yeah and so no one can hold like you know
[10938.76 → 10947.80] the the videography knowledge in Andrew and Glenn's heads ransom like it's its not uh we could
[10947.80 → 10954.44] rebuild the things needed yeah to be clear this isn't an invitation or a challenge it would be no
[10954.44 → 10960.60] you know extremely inconvenient um be really annoying yeah, but you have to put yourself in the
[10960.60 → 10968.28] position of like a really IP heavy company for instance or a bank yeah we're like it's like customer
[10968.28 → 10979.56] records so you know how do you know who has how much money I understand the idea behind it where
[10979.56 → 10987.64] if you can is you can remove the financial incentive for bad actors to engage in these ransomware attacks
[10988.20 → 10994.36] then theoretically you can stamp out ransomware completely or reduce them okay that's where I was
[10994.36 → 10999.24] going next with it because not every ransomware attack is necessarily even about the money some of
[10999.24 → 11006.20] them are also some folks just wants to watch the world burn also some folks are financially incentivized
[11006.20 → 11013.96] by competitors let's not pretend that doesn't happen it is a hundred percent a thing so then you would
[11013.96 → 11021.56] know in fact you could even you could even expect that to ramp up because you would know that you're not
[11021.56 → 11030.28] just dealing a financial blow you are potentially dealing a debilitating company destroying or the
[11030.28 → 11036.84] financial blow is doubled because what's the what's the penalty for well it's always a fine so it's
[11036.84 → 11041.64] nobody's going to go to jail for paying, so there's a ransom and a fine so it's even more so
[11041.64 → 11054.04] yeah it's a cool idea but much like the idea of just legalizing all illicit substances um you know just
[11054.04 → 11062.76] making drug trafficking go away in practice the world is a lot more complicated and yeah a lot less black
[11062.76 → 11070.84] and white than that yeah so I guess it kind of comes back to something we've talked about a fair
[11070.84 → 11076.04] bit on the land show and that is that if anyone is promising you a silver bullet an easy solution to
[11076.04 → 11083.08] all of your problems um you should approach with a high degree of distrust
[11085.08 → 11090.20] well anyway I thought it would, I thought we'd have a longer conversation about it, I thought it was an
[11090.20 → 11095.32] interesting idea but yeah it seems pretty obvious on the face of it that this just isn't really going
[11095.32 → 11105.88] to solve the problem a secure boot bypass threatens 200 000 framework Linux laptops uh the source is
[11105.88 → 11115.56] bleeping computer via Redditor off 732 units shipped with signed UFI shell components that could be exploited
[11115.56 → 11125.16] to bypass secure boot protections that's kind of all there was to this I just felt like back to Luke's
[11125.16 → 11131.56] conversation earlier about being like the coach's son um not necessarily being that great because if
[11131.56 → 11136.84] anything it throws a little bit of extra scrutiny on you um I don't know that not all cybersecurity
[11136.84 → 11142.36] topics necessarily make it to wan show and this one probably wouldn't have but because I'm invested in
[11142.36 → 11147.24] framework this was a good idea to bring up um I felt like this is a good thing for us to point out
[11147.24 → 11152.84] uh cat OS points out in float plane chat already patched by the way that's cool the other thing
[11152.84 → 11157.72] that I thought was cool was like I've never really given any thought to how many computers framework has
[11157.72 → 11164.52] sold but 200 000 Linux I was just going to say this still doesn't tell you because it's just the Linux one
[11164.52 → 11169.24] so it's probably yeah considerably more than that like more much more than a doubling I would guess
[11169.24 → 11174.12] i i i i I don't know how many computers they sell but if they can have 200 000 of anything
[11174.12 → 11179.56] deployed in the wild that seems like pretty good yeah especially when you see their base prices
[11179.56 → 11184.04] yeah so it's a lot of revenue at the very least good I don't know what their costs are good job
[11184.04 → 11190.68] framework let's go uh good luck with that framework investment disclosure and in other news around
[11190.68 → 11198.76] mobile devices' apple has revealed their m5 chip and second generation vision pro that's right the vision
[11198.76 → 11205.00] pro is not abandoned but let's do the m5 chip first uh apple boasts it offers improved image and video
[11205.00 → 11213.08] processing they're saying it is 15 faster than the m4 it's 10 core GPU now has four times the m4 chips
[11213.08 → 11221.32] peak compute, and it can be found in the new 14-inch MacBook Pro iPad Pro and vision pro it seems to be
[11221.32 → 11227.96] the only real upgrade to each of those things just the new m5 chip man Apple Silicon is like too good
[11228.92 → 11234.84] the number of people I know that have m1 Apple Silicon and are just super happy with it completely
[11234.84 → 11241.24] happy with it super happy zero desire for a 15 faster whatever 10 core GPU they don't care at all
[11241.24 → 11247.56] that's from that's from m4 I know so it's considerably faster from m1 but zero cares it's just so efficient
[11247.56 → 11255.00] I think at the end of the day what apple nailed was that um people care deeply about the battery life
[11255.00 → 11264.04] of their mobile devices and I was getting trolled hard in Arizona because I had a Lenovo little happy
[11264.04 → 11271.40] poppy and Lucas and nick the people I was with both had macBooks and I was hauling around my freaking
[11271.40 → 11279.32] charger like a chump, and they never bothered because their laptops were totally fine the whole
[11279.32 → 11284.60] time and i would you know one of them would be like well mine's at 70 battery life and
[11284.60 → 11291.56] I'd be like well mine's at 100 because it's plugged in um but like I was definitely taking the l the
[11291.56 → 11300.36] entire weekend nice, and it sucked nice the latest generation intel and AMD chips are much better uh
[11300.36 → 11305.24] lunar lake I can never keep track of intel's code names I think it's a lunar lake though they're they're
[11305.24 → 11313.08] mine's meteor their latest generation is actually really efficient yeah um and like perfect like
[11313.08 → 11321.00] I was pretty blown away at how well the uh MSI claw ai8 plus or whatever the names dude handheld like
[11321.00 → 11327.00] oh stop just call it the call it the death bringer or something call it something memorable for crying
[11327.00 → 11333.00] out loud anyway i I don't know man it doesn't matter the point is just called it anything other than
[11333.40 → 11342.84] MSI claw the MSI death ai8 plus ew dude remember skull trail yeah that was cool dude it was so sick
[11343.08 → 11348.68] and we still remember if it was so sick 15 years from now are we going to remember the logo is so
[11348.68 → 11357.64] sick MSI AI now I'm even I'm not even sure if I can remember it now but anyway that uh their handheld
[11357.64 → 11364.92] held up really well in comparisons with the uh the new Xbox yeah okay so rogue Xbox ally x
[11364.92 → 11376.84] uh look at these logos dude look at that oh my goodness so cool oh my goodness oh my goodness
[11376.84 → 11383.88] isn't going to work whatever uh it totally did actually there so cool apparently that was very challenging
[11383.88 → 11390.20] politically I'm sure it was, but it was so sick at a company like intel oh it was cool yeah
[11390.20 → 11400.76] um anyway so good luck apple with the m5 uh also new vision pro it's got the same 3500 price tag as
[11400.76 → 11407.64] the first gen it replaces the m2 chip from the first gen with a new m5 uh so you get better memory
[11407.64 → 11415.56] bandwidth 153 gigabytes per second up from 100 it now has a 120 hertz capable display the m2 topped out at
[11415.56 → 11424.76] 100 hertz it gets 30 minutes of additional claimed battery life it's 100 to 150 grams heavier that's
[11424.76 → 11431.00] actually astounding is that just because of the woven strap being like two weaves now does anyone
[11431.00 → 11437.72] actually know this no idea how could they possibly think making the vision pro heavier is the solution
[11437.72 → 11445.96] someone anyone chat no idea no trade-ins apparently wow
[11451.40 → 11458.84] no trade-in which is insane I mean is it insane they added weights to the back of the new strap to
[11458.84 → 11464.84] balance it out that's interesting that's very interesting okay
[11464.84 → 11471.40] man the bigger issue for me was just the way it sat right on the bridge of my nose oh yeah really
[11471.40 → 11478.20] painful yeah maybe they're trying to reduce that yeah maybe apparently I might be doing the short
[11478.20 → 11485.96] circuit for that oh really bit of a wild choice yeah I'm not kind of makes sense use the vision pro
[11485.96 → 11491.32] once for like 20 minutes on wan show yeah, but you like VR yeah the last one I used was an index
[11491.32 → 11499.40] yeah I mean that's a good VR headset you have your beyond now right I right it has never turned
[11499.40 → 11505.08] on right it's literally sitting at my desk yeah it has not gone to my house why would it is would just
[11505.08 → 11510.60] be in danger yeah his house is torn apart if you're tuning in a little bit late yeah
[11510.60 → 11518.68] uh but I will do it justice I will do well the bows sound touch app will not be touching anyone
[11519.40 → 11524.60] ever again this uh section of the show was written by Adam the sex machine sondergaard okay
[11526.60 → 11530.92] sorry that's in the that's in the have to it's in the notes we have to read the notes Adam uh was
[11530.92 → 11537.24] apparently feeling a little spicy when he was typing up the notes for this one I heard you like your smart
[11537.24 → 11543.32] speakers it would be a shame if we stopped supporting them don bows probably he writes
[11544.20 → 11550.28] on February 18th 2026 the day after the sexiest LTT writer turns 31
[11553.24 → 11559.96] bows will discontinue cloud support for all sound touch products this means that access to integrated
[11559.96 → 11567.16] services like Spotify or tune in won't work to add insult to injury all app functionality will
[11567.16 → 11575.64] be discontinued that means no EQ no changing audio presets no multi-room playback so if you
[11575.64 → 11582.12] spent thousands of dollars on your Bose smart speakers well hey don't worry about that they can
[11582.12 → 11590.28] still play music via Bluetooth aux and HDMI which is perhaps truly the smartest way to connect to
[11590.28 → 11597.00] speakers Bose has not announced any plans to provide local only control via the app or any
[11597.00 → 11606.12] path for users to maintain the smartness of their speakers wow I don't think there's really much to
[11606.12 → 11614.36] discuss here other than go yourself Bose this is not cool you need to fix this you need to just
[11615.24 → 11622.84] open source it because this is not acceptable not going to lie I wasn't particularly interested in it but i
[11622.84 → 11630.44] can fully confirm I will not be buying bows anytime soon because of this that's just trash I hate it
[11630.44 → 11637.32] gross like if you gave a full refund no problem, but you're not you're not there's no way you were
[11637.32 → 11645.72] selling stuff as recently as just very recently, and now you're just not going to have it do the things
[11645.72 → 11658.28] that you said it would do unbelievable uh I think it's time for an unbelievable transition to after dark
[11660.20 → 11667.32] oh wait no there's one more quick thing as of this week there's an official Ltd skin for Oct the
[11667.32 → 11672.76] overclocking and stability testing tool as part of their official v15 release really there's yeah right
[11672.76 → 11679.32] there's a few Ltd Easter eggs as well as our colour scheme used for the theme hey uh okay here we go
[11679.32 → 11689.96] I'm just going to bring this up be like a drop count detector new skins corsair and Ltd yay how cool is that
[11690.68 → 11697.48] yay oh that's just a link to our channel whoops it looks pretty good yeah right how cool is that I like
[11697.48 → 11704.28] it they've also got some new features um stable release of a new storage test brand-new storage
[11704.28 → 11710.84] benchmark major 3d adaptive test update also alongside a corsair skin and uh many more features
[11710.84 → 11716.20] it's live right now on ocbase.com just thought that was kind of cool thought I'd highlight that
[11716.20 → 11717.56] all right after dark time it is
[11722.52 → 11726.20] actually I'm going to make you guys start it without me, I'm going to run to the washroom okay got him
[11726.20 → 11735.48] uh did we talk about the newsletters' thing I don't think we did okay never mind we are not
[11735.48 → 11742.04] talking about newsletters you don't get to hear about it ignore the newsletter said it there's
[11742.04 → 11754.68] nothing yeah at all yeah hi hey LD I think they're talking about you have you seen that LinkedIn ops users
[11754.68 → 11761.88] into allowing their data to be used for content creation AI training I miss Lena khan yeah okay so
[11761.88 → 11769.16] me to no I didn't see that because LinkedIn why would I care um but the other crazy part about
[11769.16 → 11777.96] this is you did you hear about the OneDrive thing OneDrive um picture opt out oh good god
[11777.96 → 11786.92] here we go this was an an a post on our Subreddit um I don't know how real this is
[11788.60 → 11792.60] oh you don't want OneDrive scanning your face you can opt out but only three times a year I don't
[11792.60 → 11799.80] I don't know how real this is I have not actually checked this um but what the heck man
[11799.80 → 11806.52] I want to see if this is posted anywhere else I want to know if this is actually real or not
[11808.12 → 11815.32] can someone try this can someone check um so it's in it's in the features section of some
[11815.32 → 11823.48] settings page for OneDrive I don't have OneDrive I don't do the OneDrive thing I rip it out of every
[11823.48 → 11829.88] computer I touch yeah like immediately so I don't know but if any of you have OneDrive or use OneDrive
[11829.88 → 11838.44] could you check this I would like to see um it is seems so insane that it doesn't seem real this
[11838.44 → 11849.40] isn't rolled out production it's a test feature okay so real well maybe the three times a year thing
[11849.40 → 11854.36] goes away when it's not a test feature anymore I don't know who knows there's something even worse
[11854.36 → 11859.96] from Facebook says handyman Facebook's AI can now suggest edits to the photos still on your phone
[11864.44 → 11869.64] dude everything's got to get more and more local man it's its crazy i I'm like with that
[11869.64 → 11876.20] BOZ topic that we just had I am not interested in buying smart connected things if they connect to
[11876.20 → 11883.00] a unique app anymore like ever I'm just not going to do it if I can't connect it to a home assistant
[11883.00 → 11890.36] type thing or if it isn't just open, and potentially you know uh hireable by anyone at any time um
[11890.36 → 11893.96] that's acceptable like if they didn't build the connection to home assistant if they didn't build
[11893.96 → 11899.64] the thing, but it's open so you could do it yourself that's fine I'll go with that actually love that I'm
[11899.64 → 11904.28] not going to say that's fine that's great it's cool sounds good um but if it has to go into some
[11904.28 → 11911.56] proprietary app not interested don't care don't want it won't buy it um and that feels the same
[11911.56 → 11917.96] for this type of stuff like get out of my data i am uninterested I don't want you snooping my
[11917.96 → 11923.64] phone I know we give perms to these apps so that we can like upload photos to them and stuff gross
[11924.84 → 11927.88] rip it off my phone I'll find a way um
[11927.88 → 11938.28] um yucky don't like it don't like it the future is oddly enough the past the future is uh not cloud
[11938.28 → 11942.52] the future is storing your own things or making your own cloud you know there are a lot of options
[11942.52 → 11948.04] for that make your own someone else's computer yeah there are actually a bunch of very good options for
[11948.04 → 11952.36] that these days I don't remember the names of them off the top of my head but with a simple google search
[11952.36 → 11958.20] I'm sure you'll find a few um you can make effectively your own like google like experience
[11958.20 → 11965.16] Google Drive like experience um for you for your family uh friends maybe potentially included uh there's
[11965.16 → 11970.36] a lot of options someone said hex OS plug that's not even what I'm talking about to be completely honest
[11970.76 → 11976.60] um i I think kind of but I mean I would want the local UI that's they've they've promised that
[11976.60 → 11982.04] they're doing it do you know if it's out no, no I'm a true n's scale guy yeah so you have no idea i
[11982.04 → 11986.84] don't know either um but I'm not interested in that until it has completely local features
[11987.32 → 11992.92] um and even then just for wanting to learn the tinkering reasons I'd very likely go
[11992.92 → 11998.28] that's why I built it because it's what we run here and I wanted to delete data in a safe environment
[11998.28 → 12006.52] and now I can't uh because it's full um so now I get to have the fun of drive replacement yeah
[12006.52 → 12013.00] yeah yeah and I do my cloud back people said embrace your AI overlords, or you'll be uh torched
[12013.00 → 12018.04] in the future it's like yeah, but you can run that locally right yeah they're ours yeah they
[12018.04 → 12023.88] are our robots those are free those are open source those can be ours as well so like thousands now
[12023.88 → 12030.44] screw it I don't need your I don't need your junk I mean on that same vein lid I have used clod code yet
[12030.44 → 12036.52] most of YouTube seems to be sleeping on it still, but it is truly next level my spaces aren't
[12038.52 → 12044.12] it's what you make of it and I've made it everything which AI has been promised to me
[12044.92 → 12049.08] yeah like I think that was one of the most interesting parts of I mean it's not out yet
[12049.08 → 12055.56] but just hearing Linus talk about it um with Linus's AI coding thing was that he did what most users
[12055.56 → 12060.12] would do and just use ChatGPT oh there are I couldn't any more it was awful there are better
[12060.12 → 12066.20] systems for it yes are you using those now uh well I haven't really had to do any more vibe coding okay
[12066.20 → 12073.24] yeah so yeah and I'm not realistically going to use the vibe coding probably that I did I haven't seen it
[12073.24 → 12079.88] yet but Jordan told me that the real one is way better so I didn't play around with yours enough and
[12079.88 → 12085.48] the time gap between them was pretty big but I mean I fully expected that to happen
[12086.52 → 12091.88] but I think the conclusion of the video is going to be fascinating yeah because you did make
[12091.88 → 12097.00] something and there was a value to it because in the time that I've waited around for a real human to
[12097.00 → 12102.12] do the work I've been using if it's been done for a while still I was using it before it was done
[12102.12 → 12109.64] that's true, and the other thing is that it allowed me to find issues with the system implemented with
[12109.64 → 12116.12] real humans using it and workflows and everything integrated into the business that would have made
[12116.12 → 12121.80] it is easier for me to put together a design document for a real developer a lot of people really struggle
[12121.80 → 12127.32] with like developer design dogs oh dude yeah so if you can start playing around and inform yourself
[12127.32 → 12133.40] a little bit and then ask because I don't know what I don't know, and you can't predict everything
[12133.40 → 12138.28] about a workflow in a business environment yeah and so having something where we go okay
[12138.28 → 12147.00] we are running this now here it is its garbage assume you're going to throw it all away but here
[12147.00 → 12151.48] are the functionalities that it has that are good I like this I don't like this and here are the
[12151.48 → 12158.28] functionalities it needs that's such a valid use case even the don't like though like telling someone
[12158.28 → 12166.28] what the thing they should make should not be is actually quite valuable great yeah yeah 100 yeah
[12166.28 → 12173.72] going into Clara debt for this shirt, but it's okay because I'm about to win big on the lottery
[12173.72 → 12182.04] well slash as slash is such as Linus now that Jellyfin is officially on hexes have you gotten a chance to
[12182.04 → 12193.96] check it out not yet matter of time I really want to do it but not yet hey l and d Linus you have lots of
[12193.96 → 12202.84] tools and machines for LDT uh but what's one that you can't justify today but hope to someday oh um
[12204.36 → 12212.04] oh dude I want one of those uh I want one of those like ink based 3d printer majigs that can make like
[12212.04 → 12218.60] full colour anything you could possibly want oh yeah uh SEB and Tynan and I saw one that Joel was looking at
[12218.60 → 12225.64] too so cool amazing aren't they so cool they're getting cheap like you can make yeah well like
[12225.64 → 12230.52] that's the thing that's the thing about anything that isn't a GPU and technology is it does have a
[12230.52 → 12235.88] tendency to get cheaper over time which is so cool would you want an UV printer are you talking more
[12235.88 → 12242.52] about the full colour 3d printers uh I think I'm talking about the UV printer whatever oh man i
[12242.52 → 12246.92] forget they're the ones that can print onto like metal and stuff okay those are super cool that's
[12246.92 → 12251.88] an UV printer but I think you're talking about uh full colour 3d yes that's the one yeah those are
[12251.88 → 12261.32] really kind of insane honestly, and they can even do um like clears and uh, uh they showed off or should
[12261.32 → 12268.36] say Joel 3d printing nerd showed off a know the original aliens one of the eggs the little egg sac
[12268.36 → 12273.48] things that's so cool, and it had like goop and slime that was clear on the outside of it like it
[12273.48 → 12281.56] was coated in stuff, and it's like multi uh it's just incredible so cool and Luke what
[12282.44 → 12284.28] have you not been able to get Linus to buy
[12288.12 → 12293.24] it hasn't really often been an issue to be completely honest Luke knows how to make the business
[12293.24 → 12297.56] case for a thing I just don't think I'm that hard to convince when there's a shiny new
[12297.56 → 12304.44] toy to the I mean maybe to a fault well do I have a collab to suggest with you, I'm just thinking
[12304.44 → 12311.64] like honestly after a while i sort of stopped asking oh there was a there was a flow plane back
[12311.64 → 12316.60] when we used to have the flow plane meetings there was a flow plane meeting where I asked your like i
[12316.60 → 12322.76] don't know approval permission whatever to like to buy some servers, and you basically gave me a like why are
[12322.76 → 12331.08] you asking me this response oh man sorry sorry I don't usually mind, but that was like
[12331.08 → 12339.48] a lot and right next to my eye um and from then on I couldn't remember what I said you completely
[12339.48 → 12343.80] blind sided me with that I don't remember the exact wording, but it was something along those lines of
[12343.80 → 12349.88] just like what do you even mean like what have you done the work to like validate that this
[12349.88 → 12359.40] makes sense and I'm like yeah, and you're like then do it I'm just like okay so after a while i just
[12359.40 → 12366.28] stopped asking um yeah I don't know, and the answer is usually we're spending about the same amount or
[12366.28 → 12375.32] maybe less, and we're getting more so yeah yeah so that so then why have you waited so long
[12375.88 → 12383.88] exactly yeah so after a while it was just like okay we'll just operate um yeah okay and then for the
[12383.88 → 12390.92] lab usually it's been like okay but why isn't there 12 of them instead of four um so it's like yeah I don't
[12390.92 → 12396.52] know it's uh dude it's driven me crazy how long it's taken for us to spend money and buy things for
[12396.52 → 12402.60] the lab like we're finally building the display testing slash like theatre room so that every time
[12402.60 → 12408.28] a new big display comes in I don't have to install it at my house i I know it's like fun and everything
[12408.28 → 12414.52] Linus and pouffe or Linus and Adam dragging giant TVs across his basement, but we actually like when we
[12414.52 → 12420.84] shoot at my house we tear everything apart I don't actually prefer it um and so yeah we're
[12420.84 → 12426.52] going to have like a nice like home theatre room here at the office that can also be used as
[12426.52 → 12430.84] a light controlled space for display testing more generally I'm very excited for its labs is getting
[12430.84 → 12437.80] some structures man we're we've just hijacked except basically as they were left um you know
[12437.80 → 12443.40] some furniture and stuff left and I think the TV that you had and stuff but like the scrap
[12443.40 → 12448.60] your horse sets we're just using them I know I saw that I saw that mine is being used as the
[12448.60 → 12454.12] display testing room right now mine is being used as the overflow display testing room mostly for like
[12454.12 → 12458.92] phones yeah, and then we'll also be used for some I don't remember the exact name of it but something
[12458.92 → 12463.96] and it's not being used for that yet but dms wants to use it for like a reflection chamber or
[12463.96 → 12468.52] something sure so he wants to put like cinder blocks and other things around the walls and
[12468.52 → 12473.96] something, and then we'll still use it for the phone display testing bubble bus we're we're using
[12473.96 → 12479.80] all of that basically uh and then the home theatre rooms coming in, and it's okay you put up a bunch
[12479.80 → 12485.48] of walls, and we were just like nah yes well yeah we will move in it was never it drives me crazy because
[12485.48 → 12490.92] it was never a budgetary constraint we just now couldn't get things done yeah well it's yeah
[12491.88 → 12499.24] so it's a big task we got this we got this it's going to take time um, but we're we're we're cooking
[12499.24 → 12503.80] yeah we're cooking slowly cooking yeah slow cooking but yeah if anyone's wondering what
[12503.80 → 12510.04] happened to the scrapyard war set um immediately deployed yeah we're using them for stuff we kind
[12510.04 → 12518.76] of needed some box rooms I don't know if I told you this but I stole the uh my audio setup for my team
[12518.76 → 12523.48] for well yeah I mean sure no, no I was I helped you get it out of the building oh yeah right yeah cool good
[12523.48 → 12531.56] chat hello sinus Luke and ban sinus in my new house I'm building a land centre like yours nice
[12531.56 → 12536.28] is it worth running dedicated networking to each system or just a single line to the area and then
[12536.28 → 12545.64] a switch oh well depends how far it is if it's not very far then running two Ethernet cables is
[12545.64 → 12551.88] basically the same amount of work as running one Ethernet cable um there can be constraints like if you
[12551.88 → 12558.76] have a conduit for instance and only so many cables will fit in it then maybe don't do that um in terms
[12558.76 → 12569.48] of is it worth it man probably not like if you had a 2.5 gig or I mean even better a 10 gig uplink
[12569.48 → 12579.40] to a switch in your land room you're good for a very very very long time um i unless I was going for
[12579.40 → 12582.60] 100 completion I wouldn't bother I would just run a switch
[12586.68 → 12593.88] usually been my answer Linus a while back you said you were going to daily drive a fold phone again
[12593.88 → 12598.12] is that no longer the case that is the case there's a fold seven sitting on my dresser at home
[12598.68 → 12604.12] uh it's just such a hassle to change phones I haven't even finished moving over to the iPhone air I've
[12604.12 → 12609.32] I've pretty much completed all my notes on the AirPods Pro threes which I took possession of on the
[12609.32 → 12613.64] same day that I got the iPhone air and I haven't fully migrated to the air yet
[12616.52 → 12623.24] hey DLL my co-worker was telling me about back in the day how he used to tape pins on his CPU to get
[12623.24 → 12629.16] more performance have you ever done this and how does it work uh the best I've ever done was like a
[12629.16 → 12637.24] graphite pencil mod where you could change the resistance um by pencilling a certain amount of
[12637.24 → 12642.04] uh like an artist pencil between a couple of contact points and um
[12644.60 → 12646.92] that yeah that's that's the closest I've gotten
[12648.92 → 12656.04] hey duke king and jester how do you ensure you're not going too grand on a project I have a tendency to
[12656.04 → 12663.16] invest too much on a single project and want to know how you deal with it thanks dashboard add is my
[12663.16 → 12670.92] superpower i uh I get bored and move on from things before they become too much of a resource sink for
[12670.92 → 12681.00] the most part there are some notable exceptions um LTT labs let's go let's go with that i, but that's like
[12681.00 → 12685.72] on principle that I'm sticking with it, I think it's a really important thing and I think we haven't
[12686.68 → 12692.76] delivered on the vision yet um so we so it's one of those things where if you do something halfway
[12692.76 → 12698.04] and then it fails well that wasn't a failure in the idea that was a failure in the execution
[12698.68 → 12705.00] and so until we've actually executed on the idea of it I can't say for sure if it's a good idea or not
[12705.00 → 12711.24] gal singer problem um so i that one we're going to stick with but everything else I think is mostly
[12711.24 → 12716.44] gated by just sort of how much attention span we collectively have for it internally, and we're busy
[12716.44 → 12722.52] people so it can be um very easy for things to get backordered and then if they get backordered they
[12722.52 → 12724.92] must not have been that important, and we move on, and we do something else
[12724.92 → 12733.88] hey LLD I was wondering if any of you frequented dial-up BBS's back in the day blackboard
[12733.88 → 12741.56] message servers I think is the blackboard message system no, no no I was i am 39
[12742.36 → 12749.64] so I was pretty young during the dial-up days bulletin yeah that was I knew they existed I'm sure you did
[12749.64 → 12756.76] too but like by the time I was really knowledgeable and cruising around and doing stuff they were
[12756.76 → 12763.72] previous thing yep it was forums for me and uh and like chat like the palace was my first big
[12763.72 → 12772.60] like chat room chat rooms and forums hey Wanda deal catching you live from a research trip to Canada
[12772.60 → 12779.24] when is what gets me through my PhD what's your advice on staying positive after major setbacks in a
[12779.24 → 12791.16] project oh man sheer dogged force of will uh I know it can suck to hear that, but sometimes it's
[12791.16 → 12798.84] literally the only thing that can possibly do anything team sort of grit and unity uh having
[12798.84 → 12804.28] other people who are pulling with you on the same rope helps a lot even if your face first in the mud
[12804.28 → 12810.76] having just lost a tug of war um those are the only real things right like we're social creatures we
[12811.56 → 12817.80] we want to we want to work together we want to accomplish things and yeah it can be really tough
[12818.36 → 12822.60] experiencing setbacks especially when they were you know outside your control for instance
[12823.16 → 12827.08] uh sometimes it can be even worse when they were within your control because then there's the whole
[12827.08 → 12832.04] blame situation right but just remembering you're all on the same team working together
[12832.04 → 12837.00] it's all you can really do and communicate to stakeholders whether that's I think you mentioned
[12837.00 → 12844.28] university so uh communicate to your teacher potentially or your I don't know you said research
[12844.28 → 12850.92] so maybe whoever is running your whatever program you're in um communicate to other team members try to
[12850.92 → 12858.20] build out a reasonable plan to get back on track um or alter the scope a little bit um and make it more
[12858.20 → 12864.76] manageable but talk um as much as you got to do the whole grit thing that we were referencing at the
[12864.76 → 12872.60] beginning talk as well communicate you don't want to show up a day or two before submission and be like
[12872.60 → 12877.24] oh man this like this thing kind of blind sided us like a month ago, and we've been off track for a
[12877.24 → 12883.24] while we're not quite going to make the delivery time what can we do about this no have that
[12883.24 → 12889.72] conversation now um and then try to figure it out unless you think you can alter scope or do something
[12889.72 → 12895.40] that can get you back on track without that um but be very sure about that before you go down that
[12895.40 → 12903.96] route Dan i have to get Luke's take on this well you ask him then is doing a Windows 80 worth it for a
[12903.96 → 12909.40] home lab four to ten users who you already help with pc issues and upgrading over time
[12909.40 → 12916.28] oh and just for my own home lab use I think it's a cool idea for a home lab because a lot of the
[12916.28 → 12926.76] ideas of home labs is learning real environments um Godspeed yeah 80 is so much fun but did he poo
[12926.76 → 12936.20] no I don't get it that would be plural wouldn't it Godspeed ah
[12941.00 → 12947.96] your piano one I think it has got to be one of the goat jokes one of the first lungs no, no that's
[12947.96 → 12952.76] actually like I've told that to a bunch of people I'm not even kidding that's like seriously one of my
[12952.76 → 12964.28] my favourite puns ever i it's so good it's so dumb no it's not that funny it's perfect it's not
[12964.28 → 12969.56] good it's actually perfect it's just so dumb it's very good someone's asking what it is again
[12970.36 → 12976.52] well you tell it I'm not going to do it as good i I'm not going to do it as good you have to send it
[12976.52 → 12983.16] oh man so we were just hanging out at Natalie's AMD ultimate tech upgrade and I'm
[12983.16 → 12988.04] just like I'm goofing around on set because that's kind of what I do you got to kind of bring that
[12988.04 → 12994.20] that class clown energy because it's not just about you and the audience and because like it's work
[12994.20 → 13000.52] right like I'm working I'm getting through the work day and a big part of you know helping keep
[13000.52 → 13008.36] everyone engaged in the task and enjoying themselves on camera is kind of is kind of
[13009.32 → 13015.00] bringing that energy to the set, and so i I tend to even if I know that it's not going to make it into
[13015.00 → 13022.20] the video I tend to goof around a lot um and also because I'm just like I don't know I'm just like a
[13022.20 → 13029.64] goofy person I like to enjoy life and enjoy spending time with people, and so I will often be looking for
[13030.52 → 13040.68] any yes any opportunity to like to make a dad joke uh, and so I'm like tediously working on this piano
[13041.32 → 13043.00] and I'm I'm I'm like
[13045.08 → 13048.92] pee, and so I go okay, okay okay
[13051.56 → 13054.52] how do you know that this is the number one instrument
[13054.52 → 13062.36] we're like what like well they didn't call it poo I know it's not it's not good it's not good it's
[13062.36 → 13069.56] stupid it's so dumb oh they did a call back to that in the new AMD upgrade right
[13070.84 → 13077.72] oh my god it's so good so dumb your delivery the first time was so good well I couldn't I
[13077.72 → 13081.56] couldn't deliver it with a straight face because it was so dumb it was so good
[13084.28 → 13089.56] it's an important instrument because it's like a piano not the piano it's like multi-faceted too
[13089.56 → 13098.20] no it's not it's very it's very deep it requires a high IQ to understand no it doesn't know it doesn't
[13098.76 → 13105.40] it does for sure oh man dude it's great um i I think people were I think people didn't see it coming
[13105.40 → 13111.80] though because there is uh there is probably a solid argument for the piano being the number one
[13111.80 → 13118.36] is the number one instrument because it's its so technical it's the versatility is so great
[13118.92 → 13129.32] um it's its an incredible musical instrument um and so people are kind of it gets it the best
[13129.32 → 13138.36] setups misdirect the listener yeah as I said as completely as possible um right it requires extreme
[13138.36 → 13143.88] IQ so we've got everybody sitting everybody in the room is thinking about all the technical reasons
[13143.88 → 13148.76] that a piano might be considered the most superior of all musical instruments, and then you hit them
[13148.76 → 13154.76] with a pee poo, poo literally watching the episode I was like I think it I mean I think it is
[13154.76 → 13162.28] the number one instrument and then and then you drop that because it's a piano not a piano and i just
[13162.28 → 13172.36] lost it dude oh i i i I think it's contender for goat pun no i actually I think that I think
[13172.36 → 13178.84] the underwear today was a superior setup and delivery you just didn't get it because it was a much higher
[13178.84 → 13184.60] IQ joke I think those are better I don't I mean they're a different class I don't think the boulder
[13184.60 → 13190.28] rock one was better it's a different class because it kind of goes here's our boulder designs they rock
[13190.28 → 13196.12] come on okay that's more of a pure pun the other one was more of like uh just set up punchline I don't
[13196.12 → 13201.32] I don't I don't actually I hate that pun has become the word to mean anything that is a joke
[13201.32 → 13207.96] wordplay yeah we're well puns are wordplay but now anything that's a joke is a pun no
[13208.92 → 13214.92] the way people use it no way dude they use it like scam like anything that's a bad deal is a scam
[13214.92 → 13219.96] even if it was exactly as advertised like this is a scam it's like no, no no scam means a specific
[13219.96 → 13225.96] thing scam means misled Hannah's like word like Amelia Bedelia i that's weird I haven't experienced
[13225.96 → 13230.68] this I don't make the rules I have not experienced this check the laundry you know that though there's a
[13230.68 → 13235.24] whole book on that the kids don't read these it's like I believe you but I have not experienced it's like
[13235.24 → 13243.40] people using slash s to mean things that are not sarcasm is a very specific thing it's
[13243.40 → 13248.84] verbal irony with an intent to cut uh to inflict
[13250.76 → 13259.16] hurt feelings um it doesn't just mean like I'm saying a different thing than this is a joke this is
[13259.16 → 13264.60] a joke or that I'm saying a different thing than what I actually think that is not what sarcasm is
[13265.64 → 13272.12] um good job understanding English everyone that's sarcasm
[13272.12 → 13286.36] pause for awkward silence hit me dad hi DLL I am a running the Toronto waterfront marathon this
[13286.36 → 13294.20] weekend now are they running it or are they running it uh oh uh this is actually
[13295.72 → 13302.28] both funny and a legitimate question but I think what is the biggest athletic event it's a pun
[13304.84 → 13310.04] I don't get if it's not a please explain the joke to me okay go ahead what is the biggest athletic
[13310.04 → 13317.72] event you have either participated or attended in participated there should be if we're correcting
[13317.72 → 13322.20] people's English depends on how you know it's in which you have either participated or attended
[13322.20 → 13328.68] you can't say participated in that's even more English sorry so good sorry thank you
[13328.68 → 13333.64] yeah Canadian English you correct someone and apologize
[13338.28 → 13345.56] I don't know how to define biggest most people there or what most important to
[13345.56 → 13351.40] you most important to who attended okay so attended I don't know like a hockey game I guess I don't
[13351.40 → 13356.60] attended seems lame skip attended what's okay participated I think uh because attended for all of us is
[13356.60 → 13361.64] going to be like hockey game I don't I don't is that incorrect I think he's English he's probably
[13361.64 → 13368.04] been to a footy game I think this is more of like have you been in with 13 crumpets perchance
[13368.84 → 13376.20] no there's just violence mostly violence and chanting it's like uh yeah no I think this is more um
[13376.20 → 13383.32] actually like if you competed in a hockey game or something like that yeah that's how i
[13383.32 → 13388.44] interpreted it but i yeah the attended just throw it off slightly but yeah absolutely I know what
[13388.44 → 13393.88] they mean by it, they have 180 characters do we mean big in terms of number of attendees or big in
[13393.88 → 13398.84] terms of importance because you like one provincial championships and stuff right yeah like I've never
[13398.84 → 13405.00] done that I did nerd sports like I was never good at sports but nerd sports was sick it was sick
[13405.00 → 13411.80] it has more views than your provincial championship depending on where you put the line my participation
[13411.80 → 13417.00] in nerd sports might be yeah more people watched you suck at hockey than watching you be good at hockey
[13419.48 → 13421.00] that's so sad, but it's true
[13423.80 → 13428.76] I don't know uh probably the biggest one I like participated in somewhat decently would be maybe
[13428.76 → 13434.36] like a badminton tournament or something oh I'm so upset the upcoming badmintology team tournament i
[13434.36 → 13440.68] the timing just sucks for me like I don't have time to put together a squad or join a squad right now
[13440.68 → 13449.56] because I'm like busy just do it on the plane no i I'm not going to be able to um like it fills up in
[13449.56 → 13455.00] like a day, and they announced it like earlier today and people have been like putting together their
[13455.00 → 13460.68] teams all day and like I've been at work and also like I didn't already like kind of think oh yeah I guess
[13460.68 → 13464.04] that's coming up and like start putting things together so I think I'm just going to miss it is
[13464.04 → 13468.52] sucks that was where that was when I got injured last year though so maybe it just is fine
[13470.44 → 13477.08] I've been like I'm still not fully recovered from tennis elbow from overuse at that tournament last year so
[13479.64 → 13486.76] Linus instead of incrementally buying bigger and better TVs when are you going to just get the wall
[13486.76 → 13495.56] from Samsung or for some micro led goodness man i have to see them be seamless I have not seen those
[13495.56 → 13501.16] be a better experience yet yeah i um, and also they're so much more expensive like yeah I could go
[13501.16 → 13509.80] from 115 to 136 I think uh what are the different sizes of the wall these days the wall
[13509.80 → 13517.16] okay 11th studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd not what I was talking about great album
[13517.16 → 13524.60] stupid name for our TV okay here we go the ultimate visual experience for luxury completely modular right
[13525.16 → 13532.68] yep, but they have like kind of for the the the home ones they have like kits like they have ones
[13532.68 → 13539.48] that they expect you to buy here shop now oh sorry I couldn't just buy like one panel for like sorry no
[13539.48 → 13545.00] items are available to see the wall the bathroom or something so annoying why is this hard
[13547.08 → 13554.68] all in 130 inch 2k yeah no I'm going to spend that kind of money and I'm not going to go 4k you've got to be
[13554.68 → 13560.12] kidding me yeah and that's because these are commercial displays so it doesn't always make it shut up
[13560.12 → 13567.00] uh oh no am I oh am I just I'm just looking at this one right now what is happening right now direct
[13567.00 → 13576.04] view led okay we good well oh my god now I'm here LCD video wall shop now what a confusing website
[13576.04 → 13584.36] what just happened okay here we go this is a video wall how is this a video wall that's not a video wall
[13584.36 → 13593.64] that's a 55-inch commercial display why would you call it that ugh oh it has extremely narrow bezels I guess
[13594.76 → 13598.20] I guess I'll allow it to wait that's it
[13601.16 → 13603.96] that's all of led video wall are you kidding me right now
[13607.16 → 13613.32] you cannot convince me that that was this is not a terrible website how did I end up so lost
[13614.36 → 13621.32] you managed to navigate to the business site well yeah because that's where I'm supposed to be
[13622.52 → 13626.04] it's part of their business thing also how do what do you mean I managed
[13628.60 → 13635.96] okay so let's go back to luxury living for luxury living okay, okay I don't just want a brochure I want
[13635.96 → 13641.56] to I want to browse the site seamless design bold look okay we go all the way down all the way down all
[13641.56 → 13647.40] the way down shop the wall products buy now here we go, and it just takes me to this one oh no this is
[13647.40 → 13653.56] it which one did I click last time for crying out loud okay direct view led i am series well how do i
[13653.56 → 13659.56] see the whole thing I don't just want the one oh I could I series here, here okay are we good okay I think
[13659.56 → 13667.16] we're good wait what that that's it oh, oh I can click here okay so they have a 110 inch I wouldn't get that
[13667.16 → 13675.32] that's like 1080p anyway so that's stupid so 146 inch 220 grand so what I'm going to spend 220 000
[13675.32 → 13681.08] I'm going to have seams in my display they say seamless can oh is this one seamless hold on a second
[13682.12 → 13687.96] is this one seamless anyway there are other drawbacks too i I truly don't know what the input leg is
[13688.76 → 13694.76] um but yeah cooling the room is a challenge these things draw mono power and then maybe more
[13694.76 → 13701.00] importantly they're not actually necessarily better than the 115 inch that I have now in terms of
[13701.00 → 13707.64] performance and a big part of the reason for that is that they don't crank as bright surprising amount
[13707.64 → 13713.24] of reviews yeah no bad performance low price only 3000 hertz what what yes I recommend this
[13713.24 → 13722.76] product like clearly people are just trolling a bit big for a single bedroom apartment three stars like I would
[13722.76 → 13728.60] just ignore it is your fake they should do verified purchase there's no way that this isn't written by AI
[13730.84 → 13738.52] um yep this has got to be just someone's just written with AI probably a story like I don't think any of
[13738.52 → 13744.60] this is real i I would if I was Samsung I would probably just turn off any not verified purchase reviews
[13744.60 → 13751.96] for a product like this because it's clearly not helping anyone yeah all I'm proposing tomorrow oh
[13751.96 → 13758.68] congratulations what were any of your I know that she's the one moments with your significant other
[13760.92 → 13768.04] she learned video games to spend time with me, she did play some like very simple games like as a kid
[13768.04 → 13775.88] like dangerous Dave was a favourite of Yvonne's um, but she is like learned fps like shooter games to play them
[13775.88 → 13781.80] with me um that's that's a pretty solid sign she's a keeper also she stuck with me even though I was such a
[13781.80 → 13789.64] loser in university um there are a lot of the one moments for me, I don't know what hers were
[13792.60 → 13797.16] like I must be a lot better looking than I think I am or something because really like I was
[13797.16 → 13800.20] irredeemable early on I don't I don't get what she was thinking
[13802.76 → 13808.52] hey Wanda do question for Luke when buying things like sporting equipment or tools for yourself how do you
[13808.52 → 13812.60] balance cost and quality see this is what now I'm going to lose my cheapness
[13815.08 → 13825.08] flag trait I don't know what you want to call it truth um i I generally okay maybe I won't completely
[13825.72 → 13832.76] lose it I tend to buy less stuff but I try to buy better things I go with the whole like try to buy
[13832.76 → 13840.76] something that's going to last basically forever um option um I like to think that the tools that
[13840.76 → 13846.44] I have bought are generally pretty good I'll spend time and research them um like the drills the
[13846.44 → 13852.76] drills that I bought when I finally was like okay I need to have my own drills um brand Milwaukee brushless
[13852.76 → 13860.60] I was quite happy about that purchase you get a pass um and i yeah I try to do that for things so
[13860.60 → 13867.88] i yeah fewer of them better things is usually what I try to do buy the cheap one from harbour freight and
[13867.88 → 13873.16] then when it breaks get the most expensive one you can and I have done that yeah or just borrow them
[13873.16 → 13887.00] from work holy dangerous Dave that john Romero yeah yeah yeah for sure oh I had no idea yeah
[13889.72 → 13896.36] all right let's play some dangerous Dave shall we how do i uh how do I start okay what why are we
[13896.36 → 13904.36] dangerous Dave that's the game that Yvonne had liked yeah oh okay yep this was like Yvonne's gaming
[13905.40 → 13914.36] chops when I met her, and it is really hard um like the way the fall physics if you could call them that
[13914.36 → 13921.32] work um it's got air control that's kind of thing it's its pretty rough there's only 10 levels um but
[13922.04 → 13929.48] getting through them is quite difficult yes chat by the way I did hear you um i will call Yvonne
[13929.48 → 13936.52] we can ask her how do you get that ruby I don't think you're meant to oh it's just bait oh balls
[13938.04 → 13943.56] if it's hard I promise it's legitimately very hard oh my god
[13943.56 → 13950.84] I've been trying to think about mine for Emma by the way and I think there was um when my when
[13950.84 → 13958.52] my grandpa was passing away we had to go down to Arizona um and I didn't even ask her to go i
[13958.52 → 13966.20] didn't expect her to go uh, but she went, and she was an absolute trooper the whole time she did so much
[13967.16 → 13972.28] work like we were clearing out his house and like my mom and I had to go through a bunch of his documents
[13972.28 → 13976.92] and figure what we needed to shred and do whatever else, and she disappeared for a few hours and i
[13976.92 → 13981.40] assumed like I don't know what she's doing whatever sounds good and then when she came back she was like
[13981.40 → 13989.72] well I cleaned out the entire garage, and it was just like what nice okay she was going hard the whole time
[13989.72 → 13993.00] uh and that was actually very cool all right
[13999.48 → 14008.12] hey, hey you're uh live on the wan show so um chat was asking like when was my like you know
[14008.12 → 14012.44] she's the one moment with you and I was kind of talking about you like learning left for dead just
[14012.44 → 14017.88] to like play games with me and stuff like that uh and oh my god I'm trying to play dangerous Dave right
[14017.88 → 14025.16] now I'm about to get my ah dang it is it really is dangerous game yeah don't worry
[14025.16 → 14031.32] about it the point is that uh I was talking about how what I wasn't really sure what my redeeming
[14031.32 → 14037.40] quality oh for crying out loud that bloody spider um I wasn't sure what my redeeming qualities were
[14037.96 → 14042.36] um, and they wanted to know what your like how you knew moments were
[14042.36 → 14048.68] um oh man yeah right tough I think a really long time back
[14051.16 → 14052.76] oh that's brutal
[14054.76 → 14055.96] sorry he's talking about dangerous
[14055.96 → 14059.24] not you yeah yeah no, no no I figured
[14060.52 → 14066.20] um honestly I feel like I was a dumb girl back then and I was just in love
[14066.20 → 14070.44] all right thanks that's kind of what I expected to hear it doesn't make it easier but
[14071.48 → 14080.04] not unexpected no I mean I knew you were smart, and you challenged me and i I liked that we were
[14080.04 → 14086.52] able to communicate and talk about things that we don't like that's not easy to talk about um
[14086.52 → 14097.88] um I liked that you were like remember so far I know English sorry so far I know English um smart
[14097.88 → 14105.32] to communicate yeah um you were very charming which I feel like is sometimes the opposite of me and i
[14105.32 → 14111.96] needed that like not just charming but like really laid back um in some ways not every way
[14111.96 → 14118.68] yeah it's not usually balanced to me if that makes sense you were like you know we talk about yin and
[14118.68 → 14124.20] yang they're opposites, but they like mesh well together okay so we got Yvonne being responsible
[14124.20 → 14129.72] and stable, and we've got me being probably the first time I've ever heard you described as laid back
[14129.72 → 14139.24] yeah well I mean I was pretty high-strung it's all relative it's all relative yeah okay like I'm
[14139.24 → 14145.96] I'm I'm much more uh easy going now but okay I feel like in some ways I was high-strung because of you
[14145.96 → 14154.28] though so I don't know all right I think that's probably enough of this for now
[14156.04 → 14159.96] okay all right see you soon love oh that's hilarious bye
[14161.72 → 14168.12] that's very funny I mean it's about yeah I'm not gonna lie about what I expected but um there you
[14168.12 → 14175.80] have it you heard it from the horse's mouth up next as requested making good use of the gift card
[14175.80 → 14180.84] before the holiday season uh thank you actually a lot of people have been using the gift
[14180.84 → 14186.44] cards appreciate that legitimately they thought they would save them, but they can't help themselves
[14186.44 → 14191.40] as requested making good use of the gift card before the holiday season any of you all have Halloween
[14191.40 → 14200.36] outfits planned no um I haven't had a Halloween outfit since uh we had the house was
[14200.36 → 14204.92] our office and I scared people on the porch well people are so upset they're like don't call your
[14204.92 → 14209.24] wife a horse what do you think a ho is short for oh my god no i
[14209.24 → 14216.84] don't miss direct him you missed you have to misdirection when did you know it's an expression
[14216.84 → 14221.08] from the horse's mouth like it just means from the source oh yeah I wouldn't have yeah no I know i
[14221.08 → 14227.96] know that's not a ding that wasn't a pun no it was a joke dings are not for puns they're for dad jokes
[14227.96 → 14240.20] exactly oh, oh yeah oh dude I'm in such rough shape I did an um the son's taekwondo school like
[14240.20 → 14246.44] no disrespect to taekwondo, but it's not like a serious fighting martial art for the most part um
[14247.56 → 14253.00] but I still wanted the kids to like to learn martial arts it's good for you know discipline and good to
[14253.00 → 14258.92] learn to stick with something until you, you know get your black belt it's good socially it's good
[14258.92 → 14262.76] it's good for lots of things it's good for getting you out of your shell a little bit i my
[14262.76 → 14269.48] kids can tend to be a little bit shy sometimes and I think you know forcing them to you know shout and
[14269.48 → 14273.96] and practice sparring just there are a lot of things that I think it can be really helpful for
[14273.96 → 14276.92] developmentally I'm not saying it's for everyone but I'm saying it's something that
[14276.92 → 14282.12] I believed in so all my kids have had to do taekwondo um anyway the point is that the instructor
[14282.12 → 14290.20] uh before this particular organization converted to taekwondo uh used to uh train under something
[14290.20 → 14297.64] under the same you know master or whatever, but it used to be called um something combat something and
[14297.64 → 14306.28] it was like very street brawler how to break bones and um and get away kind of, and so I had actually
[14306.28 → 14310.76] asked him because my son's been losing a little bit of interest with the taekwondo side of things
[14310.76 → 14315.48] and so i I asked the instructor I was like hey do you want to do like some privates with us and do
[14315.48 → 14322.84] some more like some more like grappling some more submissions uh some more like more
[14323.88 → 14329.40] stuff you don't teach the kids like you know neck takedowns and stuff like that, and he's like
[14330.04 → 14338.76] I'd love to um you know he's a super cool guy anyway the point is that I had an I had a session with him
[14338.76 → 14350.04] on um Wednesday no, no uh what was it Wednesday yeah I had no what day are things yeah I had a
[14350.04 → 14355.88] session with him on Wednesday night um right after work so I had a long day at work and then my son and
[14355.88 → 14363.96] I went and did like like like a bunch of like neck takedowns uh choke holds neck submissions choke hold
[14363.96 → 14371.32] counters and like basically a bunch of stuff and so Thursday I had a long drive to an AMD ultimate
[14371.32 → 14378.92] tech upgrade long day AMD ultimate tech upgrade and then uh oh sorry no first Wednesday after
[14378.92 → 14384.52] the training I went and I had badminton training for two hours so just like multi feeds if you guys are
[14384.52 → 14391.08] wondering what that looks like um basically uh you can check out the badminton insight channel
[14393.88 → 14401.16] we did a collab with them where they had me train like a pro for a day um it's pretty brutal but
[14401.16 → 14407.80] basically this is not was not me uh I'm in I'm in all black here and I mostly looked like that but
[14407.80 → 14415.40] you go pretty hard so you basically are just running getting stuff sometimes missing them
[14415.40 → 14420.92] the point is its pretty tough and then yesterday I had ladder so I had competitive ladder I am like
[14420.92 → 14429.08] I'm dying my body is dead this is the ghost of me it's my Halloween costume it's pretty good yeah um
[14429.72 → 14434.44] like I could barely shoulder check in my car on Thursday and then I had to go play ladder that night
[14434.44 → 14441.32] it was not I do I lost five out of my six games I dropped like 100 ELO points I'm so upset like
[14441.32 → 14448.04] actually very upset I should have just not even played yeah probably not Linus what difficulty do
[14448.04 → 14454.60] you recommend for ANO 1800 I am still struggling with outpacing expert AI love the show whatever you
[14454.60 → 14462.04] enjoy ANO is fun if you're not having fun just turn it down it's fine the high difficulty AI also
[14462.04 → 14468.36] extremely cheats yeah that's something that's always been a problem for ANO games like even
[14468.36 → 14473.56] going back to the very first one uh which had exhaustible iron mines and every map would only
[14473.56 → 14481.24] have like a couple iron mines so your ability to acquire iron was like extremely limited um it's
[14481.24 → 14485.72] kind of like warcraft 2 and gold mines like there's just there's no freaking gold on the map
[14486.60 → 14491.08] nah that wasn't that big of a problem in warcraft 2 much worse than gold in warcraft 2 but
[14491.08 → 14497.24] you've got this finite resource compared to um something like supreme commander where the
[14497.24 → 14502.84] resources are infinite, and it's just a question of like how you manage your economy so you've got
[14502.84 → 14507.80] this like finite iron resource the biggest problem that I noticed was they wouldn't have access to a
[14507.80 → 14512.28] certain resource that would allow them to build the thing yet would just have it and there was
[14512.28 → 14518.36] explanations like maybe they got it through trading but then even if you like laser watched their base like
[14518.36 → 14524.12] no yeah so they would just so all the iron on the map would be exhausted
[14524.84 → 14529.96] but they would like still be able to build stuff with iron it's just like come on I don't like that
[14531.00 → 14535.08] yeah i so I don't I don't love those forms of difficulty yeah but I mean realistically ANO can
[14535.08 → 14541.00] be enjoyed in any way you can play against the eyes against people you can just spawn a new world and just
[14541.00 → 14548.44] build it's its a great game oh yep there's a ton of people that play on the minimum difficulty I think
[14548.44 → 14558.52] they call it beauty building no uh what's it called shoot it has a name tiny glade what I don't know
[14558.52 → 14565.40] what that's just that's a game where you build pretty cottages okay oh um man why can I not remember what
[14565.40 → 14572.36] it's called are you sure it's not called beauty building yeah I don't think so I think it's called
[14572.36 → 14581.64] something else i maybe you're right beauty build city beauty building I mean I did search there
[14581.64 → 14586.52] are people that say beauty building but I searched beauty building so I don't know if that's like I was
[14586.52 → 14594.28] going to say the same thing yeah yeah all right anyway there's a there's a pretty large subset of
[14594.28 → 14598.04] people that play on the lowest difficulty and then just try to make really cool looking cities instead
[14598.04 → 14601.64] of the most efficient cities and then some people play on higher difficulties and try to make the
[14601.64 → 14606.92] most efficient cities I even know some people play on minimum difficulty and try to make obsessively
[14606.92 → 14610.60] efficient cities, and they just don't worry about the difficulty of the game while doing that
[14611.48 → 14614.04] apparently it's called beauty building sure I don't know
[14614.04 → 14617.96] every build is a beauty build because this game is beautiful
[14621.00 → 14626.68] build beauty building uh packs for mana demos out right now launched during steam next fest I could
[14626.68 → 14630.60] have sworn it was called something else okay well it shows you there might be another name for it i
[14630.60 → 14637.16] don't know I mean this seems to be a thing this seems to be a thing I don't know I don't know okay
[14637.16 → 14649.88] how do you deal with a product you like being bought out by a company that you're morally or ethically opposed to for example Ea or more specifically battlefield 6
[14651.00 → 14657.96] it's tough, and it's becoming tougher in this increasingly consolidated world where
[14657.96 → 14666.44] the companies that make the products that you enjoy are increasingly owned by giant objectively evil
[14666.44 → 14676.92] multinational corps or owned by nations with very questionable track records around human rights and
[14676.92 → 14686.44] um extrajudicial killings and all kinds of truly horrible things there's also problem this is unrelated to what
[14686.44 → 14691.00] they're talking about with bf6, but it is related to the whole company and ethics thing there's also like
[14692.44 → 14700.44] there seems to be a bias towards avoiding the loud ones instead of necessarily avoiding the worst ones
[14700.44 → 14706.76] yeah uh which is also interesting I don't know it's its tough you have to pick your own lines
[14707.72 → 14713.40] um and trying to assume that everyone else is going to pick the exact same lines is just going to lead you to be
[14713.40 → 14721.24] frustrated needlessly so don't do that but um yeah pick a line if that's your line then that's your line
[14723.40 → 14728.36] hey fellas after seeing the server video I was curious about the process of upgrading servers
[14728.36 → 14733.88] I imagine upgrading is very expensive and requires new cooling solutions how often do they do that
[14733.88 → 14744.76] cooling solutions' no i I wouldn't for the most part like cooling solution or the whole thing upgrading servers
[14745.80 → 14753.48] like we've definitely done it over the years, but that's a very small business thing to do large businesses
[14753.48 → 14759.40] enterprise data centre like you run it as long as the total cost of ownership makes sense
[14759.40 → 14768.28] and then you decommission it I wow that's actually very interesting because I didn't even interpret it that way
[14768.92 → 14775.40] I interpreted upgrading servers as replacing servers yeah exactly I didn't even think about yeah
[14777.00 → 14783.40] now when you are replacing servers, and you're upgrading the cooling in the data centre if that's what you're asking about
[14783.40 → 14790.84] that is a huge problem we actually discussed that very briefly in the SFU supercomputer great video by the way
[14790.84 → 14797.88] oh yeah i kind of figured that one would have gotten your attention yep um so because they have so little power going into that building
[14798.20 → 14804.60] I mean to be clear they thought it was a lot back in the day it used to be apparently like the control centre for
[14805.48 → 14808.92] uh all the bc hydro like power for the lower half of our province like
[14808.92 → 14815.64] it was built with lots of power and networking or whatever but then these new AI servers came out and
[14815.64 → 14822.28] all of a sudden they had to reroute i think it's like don't quote me on this but I think it's like
[14822.28 → 14827.88] a third of the power going into the data centre for just the GPU servers that are just like this like
[14827.88 → 14835.16] one row, and they're not even full to full density like to actually build a fully built out fully dense
[14835.16 → 14842.92] AI data centre would require this just utterly obscene power density like it's like it's insane
[14842.92 → 14843.72] um
[14845.80 → 14852.52] and it was a big problem they actually had to take down a bunch of nodes in order to
[14853.08 → 14859.08] completely reroute all the networking and power from one side of the data centre to the other in order to even do this deployment and
[14859.08 → 14861.80] consolidate enough of it that it could that it could be done
[14861.80 → 14869.00] uh huge problem and like the cooling that they added so they added um three more of those
[14869.00 → 14874.28] evaporative cooling towers that they have outside, and they were what I think they said 1.2 million a
[14874.28 → 14881.40] pop or something like that to handle the additional heat load spicy and to be clear like it is happens
[14881.40 → 14886.84] d Bollinger in chat said uh that really depends these days with the constant security issues we tend to have
[14886.84 → 14891.64] to do it quite often but yes from a hardware perspective usually just replace a physical server but not always
[14891.64 → 14898.12] and like with even the like location services we've used with like OVH or whatever else
[14898.12 → 14907.56] um we've had individual servers that we are using get upgraded usually the problem is
[14907.56 → 14912.44] drives are dying, and then they just use that opportunity to upgrade things or whatever else but
[14913.88 → 14918.44] yeah in my experience it's usually swapping out the whole server
[14918.44 → 14925.88] last one I got for you here Linus how have the first few days of your 40th year on this
[14925.88 → 14933.96] point been going not yet still in my 30s barely hanging on any updates on the full install
[14933.96 → 14939.96] of your new light switches no I need to follow that up we've um we've got a bunch of perfect
[14940.68 → 14947.40] sort of home stuff going I still have the list to work on um and there are some new members of the
[14947.40 → 14951.80] writing team that you guys will be meeting after they complete their probation assuming that they do
[14951.80 → 14958.44] knock on wood um and I'm very excited about some new home automation stuff at my house also some really
[14958.44 → 14965.88] cool stuff for the tech house one of the new guys actually flagged these um heat pump water heaters
[14965.88 → 14972.28] which I didn't know was a thing but I guess makes sense if you can heat water with gas you could
[14972.28 → 14977.64] probably also heat water with a heat pump uh, but it just has like a like a HVAC system on the top of
[14977.64 → 14981.40] it and then the water tank under it yeah pretty cool so we're going to be looking for all kinds of
[14981.40 → 14988.36] cool things he also flagged an um a smart panel to me so instead of putting smart breakers into a dumb
[14988.36 → 14992.68] panel you just have a smart panel, and it can do all kinds of cool stuff like you could tell it
[14992.68 → 14999.32] hey if we're is we're at the limit then kill these because I don't need them that bad
[14999.32 → 15003.16] so for something like whale land that could be amazing that would be perfect yeah right
[15004.04 → 15010.28] whale lands power situation is getting interesting oh crap pretty bank says you are 39 meaning you are
[15010.28 → 15011.72] living in your 40th year Linus
[15014.92 → 15016.28] right uh
[15016.28 → 15016.84] uh
[15018.84 → 15022.76] well that's depressing and I still haven't learned math, but you're not there yet
[15023.40 → 15029.00] no I am yeah, but you're not at the 40th yet well I'm not finished the 40th I'm in my 40th which
[15029.00 → 15034.36] is what they but how most people consider it well most people is a very western centric point of view
[15035.56 → 15039.72] sure no they do they know they number it differently you are western
[15039.72 → 15045.88] heehaw so it would follow how you do it would it not thanks for watching the wan show see you
[15045.88 → 15050.84] again next week same bad time same bad channel yippee-Ki-yay motherfucker okay bye
[15050.84 → 15064.68] merry Christmas
[15075.56 → 15079.56] you
