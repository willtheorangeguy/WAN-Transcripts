[0.00 → 9.46] What's up everybody and welcome to the WAN show.
[9.56 → 11.74] We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[12.12 → 21.62] Roblox sent a cease and desist letter to a YouTuber for hunting child predators on their platform.
[22.30 → 26.10] Wow, that is a little awkward.
[26.78 → 29.86] Also, PayPal is not Steam's buddy friend.
[31.00 → 39.10] So the whole thing where payment processors are allegedly dictating to gaming platforms
[39.10 → 42.74] what type of content they're allowed to sell has escalated.
[43.10 → 44.56] What else we got going on this week?
[44.56 → 52.36] YouTube has started to roll out an age verification AI model because the future is fun.
[53.26 → 55.04] And that won't be easy to work around at all.
[55.04 → 56.60] Can you pick something that's good news?
[58.04 → 59.04] Let me see.
[59.04 → 60.14] I mean, I know I didn't.
[60.40 → 60.88] Yeah.
[61.14 → 62.82] That's why it's your job.
[62.94 → 64.12] That's a bad one.
[64.36 → 65.90] That one's overall kind of negative.
[66.92 → 69.62] That literally says massive step backwards in the title.
[69.62 → 75.56] I don't care about that at all.
[75.66 → 76.72] I don't know if anyone does.
[77.90 → 78.78] This sucks.
[78.88 → 80.00] That's a bad thing.
[80.22 → 81.58] That's not a good thing.
[84.46 → 85.62] You have to pick one.
[85.62 → 88.66] Yeah, YouTuber makes real life aim bot that controls his body.
[88.76 → 89.82] It's actually a super cool video.
[89.90 → 90.50] I watched it.
[90.56 → 91.60] Hey, let's go.
[91.60 → 95.74] Oh, man.
[95.74 → 99.76] Oh, man.
[99.76 → 99.80] Oh, man.
[99.80 → 117.24] The show is brought to you today by Squarespace, Delete Me, and AMD, along with, of course, our
[117.24 → 122.72] wrap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[122.72 → 127.80] All right, let's jump right into the headline topic, and this one's going to take a minute.
[128.00 → 139.90] Elijah saw that this was about games for kids, and he took this assignment very seriously,
[139.90 → 146.76] creating an extremely long doc so that we could go through and talk about YouTuber Schlep,
[147.04 → 154.42] who has been both sent a cease and desist letter from Roblox and banned from the game
[154.42 → 158.02] related to some of his videos about Roblox.
[158.54 → 163.78] Schlep's channel, which has almost 800,000 subscribers, has been focused around catching
[163.78 → 169.02] child predators on the platform, a problem that has been rampant for years.
[169.02 → 175.00] He has achieved this by making new accounts, waiting for people to engage, and then just
[175.00 → 181.86] following along, never taking the leap since, in most cases, that would be deemed as entrapment.
[182.58 → 187.02] Schlep has been successful in working with local police and the National Centre for Missing
[187.02 → 192.52] and Exploited Children to get more than half a dozen people arrested and charged for some
[192.52 → 194.68] form of crimes against children.
[194.96 → 195.10] Awesome.
[195.10 → 201.00] Schlep has tried to work directly with Roblox on this issue in the past, including sending
[201.00 → 207.22] hundreds of chat logs and video evidence to them about certain accounts, and none have
[207.22 → 213.62] even been successful at getting the individuals banned, never mind charged, which is why Schlep
[213.62 → 216.04] has been turning to other methods for help.
[216.04 → 226.16] He has even tweeted directly at the Roblox CEO several times, and, um, well, I mean, is it proof
[226.16 → 230.38] that the CEO saw his tweet if his account was blocked?
[230.60 → 234.58] I actually don't necessarily think so, but I think it's likely.
[235.36 → 236.90] It doesn't look good.
[236.96 → 237.24] No.
[237.62 → 238.84] It's not a good look.
[238.86 → 242.20] But at some companies like this, I wouldn't be super surprised if the CEO wasn't the only
[242.20 → 244.24] person running the CEO's Twitter account.
[244.24 → 249.80] The reason for Roblox's actions, according to the letter that was sent to Schlep, are
[249.80 → 250.38] as follows.
[251.36 → 256.22] That he failed to report suspicious activity to Roblox through proper channels, which can
[256.22 → 259.68] critically expose Roblox's users to increased risk.
[262.10 → 262.90] Um, no.
[263.18 → 263.54] Okay.
[263.72 → 264.02] Okay.
[264.02 → 268.38] Uh, let's go with, maybe reason number two.
[268.58 → 268.72] Sure.
[268.72 → 269.90] Maybe reason number two will be better.
[270.02 → 270.04] Yeah.
[270.04 → 270.30] Okay.
[270.92 → 271.30] Ahem.
[272.14 → 276.68] That Schlep is engaging in simulated child endangerment conversations.
[279.38 → 279.82] Uh.
[280.86 → 282.08] Are they SIMULA-
[282.08 → 284.58] Technically, technically-
[284.58 → 285.36] Not a child.
[285.36 → 285.58] True.
[286.22 → 290.24] So that's like technically true, but is it relevant?
[292.00 → 292.44] No.
[292.74 → 293.16] Okay.
[293.36 → 293.64] Cool.
[293.68 → 294.60] I don't think so.
[294.64 → 295.64] I mean, look, we're not-
[295.64 → 297.18] It's allegedly not relevant.
[297.30 → 297.66] Hold on.
[297.68 → 299.72] I need to come sit on your side for a second here.
[299.92 → 300.18] Oh.
[300.46 → 300.94] Uh.
[301.20 → 301.50] Oh.
[301.62 → 301.78] Oh.
[301.82 → 301.98] Oh.
[301.98 → 302.00] Oh.
[302.00 → 302.32] I see.
[302.32 → 307.16] We're not legal experts.
[307.16 → 308.94] If we both press it, it goes faster.
[309.18 → 310.44] We're not legal experts.
[310.72 → 312.04] So, you know, this is all-
[312.04 → 316.28] This is all from the common sense school of not being a dipshit.
[316.28 → 319.02] So, um, let's go with-
[319.02 → 320.84] Let's go with reason number three.
[321.00 → 321.22] Yes.
[322.24 → 327.88] That Schlep is directing users to move conversations off platform.
[329.10 → 330.16] Uh, wait.
[330.16 → 335.66] Wait, which comes from these predators often requesting to have conversations on other platforms like Discord.
[335.86 → 339.24] Yeah, because up above it said that he follows their lead.
[340.02 → 345.04] So if he was doing this, I think that would actually potentially be a bad thing.
[345.84 → 355.10] But based on what we previously read, and based on the attached note to this, it sounds like he's just jumping with them off platform when asked to go off platform.
[355.10 → 357.06] Which I don't think is a bad thing.
[358.22 → 358.90] Does it-
[358.90 → 359.22] Okay.
[359.22 → 360.54] Here's a question for you.
[361.42 → 362.38] Does it matter?
[363.56 → 365.10] Who instigates?
[365.18 → 366.94] Who says we should move off platform?
[367.32 → 367.96] I think so.
[368.34 → 368.94] It does.
[369.16 → 369.64] I think so.
[369.64 → 370.02] Okay, why?
[370.02 → 370.10] Personally.
[371.10 → 383.86] Um, if you are eBay, and there's an eBay seller, and the eBay seller goes, hey, man, message me.
[383.86 → 385.40] Don't buy this.
[385.40 → 386.12] Message me.
[386.12 → 387.10] I'll get you a better price.
[387.10 → 387.50] Mm-hmm.
[387.50 → 389.30] Who are you mad at?
[389.30 → 390.52] Well, hold on a second.
[390.78 → 392.02] You're mad at the seller, right?
[392.02 → 394.58] Let me give you a different example.
[394.74 → 395.06] Yeah, okay.
[395.28 → 395.64] Okay.
[395.64 → 396.64] Okay.
[396.64 → 397.76] So I'm eBay.
[397.76 → 398.52] Okay.
[398.52 → 398.56] Okay.
[398.56 → 398.58] Okay.
[398.58 → 399.02] Okay.
[399.02 → 404.52] And there's a seller who is selling child materials.
[404.52 → 406.14] Okay.
[406.14 → 412.32] And either the buyer or the seller says they want to move a conversation off platform.
[412.98 → 414.56] Who f***ING cares?
[415.22 → 417.60] Who decided to move the conversation off platform?
[417.72 → 419.40] I should probably deactivate the account.
[419.66 → 419.78] Yeah.
[420.82 → 422.18] So that's my counterargument.
[422.72 → 423.62] But which account?
[424.40 → 424.76] Both.
[425.20 → 425.44] Yeah.
[425.82 → 426.36] Well, okay.
[426.42 → 426.72] Hold on.
[426.76 → 427.02] Hold on.
[427.06 → 427.28] Hold on.
[427.34 → 427.54] No.
[427.70 → 428.08] No.
[428.22 → 429.78] The person with the materials.
[431.22 → 432.04] So you're...
[432.04 → 432.16] Oh, wait.
[432.26 → 432.60] Oh, okay.
[432.60 → 436.84] In your situation, there's a buyer of said material, so please ban them both.
[436.96 → 437.18] Okay.
[437.18 → 437.20] Yes.
[437.20 → 439.26] But that's not really the scenario that we're talking about.
[439.28 → 440.12] I see what you mean.
[440.20 → 441.18] I see what you mean.
[441.56 → 443.50] So basically, row...
[443.50 → 447.86] Okay, so this is the first one that I think we could maybe agree there is a shred of merit
[447.86 → 448.14] to.
[448.62 → 460.50] Because you could make the argument that Schlep is offering what these people want and trying
[460.50 → 461.72] to move them off platform.
[461.96 → 465.52] If that actually happened, which Schlep claims it didn't.
[465.52 → 467.44] Twice in this document it says that he didn't.
[467.66 → 469.38] This is all we know right now.
[469.92 → 471.08] So it depends.
[471.24 → 472.76] It depends on the scenario.
[472.76 → 474.90] If he's trying to move people off platform, then sure.
[475.30 → 479.94] But if he's being asked to move off platform, then I don't think that's his problem.
[479.96 → 481.22] I don't think that's his problem at all.
[481.40 → 481.48] No.
[481.58 → 481.84] Okay.
[481.98 → 482.54] Number four.
[484.66 → 489.12] That Schlep is sharing or soliciting personally identifiable information.
[489.54 → 490.84] Is he doxing these people?
[491.40 → 491.96] And...
[491.96 → 493.44] Or is sharing or soliciting...
[493.44 → 495.76] Well, soliciting would already be just...
[495.76 → 496.62] Yeah, what does that mean?
[496.68 → 497.98] It just means asking for.
[497.98 → 498.70] Oh.
[498.80 → 502.74] So by asking these people for any kind of personally identifiable information...
[502.74 → 506.66] And I could see that being against TOS and I could see Roblox having something to stand
[506.66 → 507.02] on here.
[507.36 → 507.54] Sure.
[508.20 → 509.12] However...
[509.12 → 510.44] Kind of...
[510.44 → 512.76] Again...
[512.76 → 514.32] One grain of sand on the beach.
[514.52 → 515.12] I...
[515.12 → 517.88] ASL.
[518.34 → 519.12] Oh my.
[519.52 → 520.48] There's a throwback.
[520.56 → 521.76] Yeah, it's been a minute.
[522.16 → 522.96] There's a throwback.
[523.20 → 528.04] It's funny because I didn't really think much of it at the time, but I definitely had adults
[528.04 → 530.68] say that to me when I was definitely a minor.
[531.08 → 531.42] Oh yeah.
[531.94 → 534.00] That was like...
[534.00 → 534.18] Yeah.
[534.72 → 540.12] Sorry, but someone in chat said 14F Cali and that's just like...
[540.12 → 542.86] That was indeed the joke back then.
[547.68 → 548.72] Also, you're a liar.
[549.54 → 549.88] Yeah.
[550.10 → 550.56] Yeah.
[550.62 → 551.72] We know our demographics.
[551.72 → 560.54] It's like 28M Cali.
[560.72 → 561.00] Yeah.
[562.78 → 564.34] An optimistic 28.
[565.90 → 566.62] Whenever...
[566.62 → 567.16] Is that our Democrat?
[567.24 → 568.28] Is it higher than 28 now?
[568.40 → 569.44] No, not necessarily.
[569.52 → 570.14] Yeah, I didn't think so.
[570.16 → 570.90] It's about 18 to 45.
[571.22 → 574.68] I actually think if you looked at like the most common one, it's probably about...
[574.68 → 575.52] It's 25 to 35.
[576.14 → 576.40] Yeah.
[576.74 → 577.04] Okay.
[577.14 → 577.34] Yeah.
[577.46 → 578.52] If I recall correctly.
[578.52 → 581.40] So 28M Cali is probably actually like a...
[581.40 → 582.52] Probably pretty...
[582.52 → 583.34] Yeah.
[583.48 → 584.26] Pretty bang on.
[584.38 → 584.96] It's not too bad.
[585.06 → 587.50] Yvonne and I have kind of like a little like a thing.
[588.36 → 590.14] So whenever...
[590.14 → 594.58] Like whenever a woman starts approaching, like they're gonna...
[594.58 → 595.64] Like they're gonna talk to me.
[596.42 → 597.20] I'll like...
[597.20 → 598.60] I'll like to give her...
[598.60 → 599.72] I'll give her a little look.
[600.26 → 600.90] Yvonne, I mean.
[600.98 → 602.08] I'll give Yvonne a little look.
[603.06 → 603.54] Stop.
[604.50 → 605.36] You knew what I meant.
[605.54 → 606.46] No, I knew already.
[606.46 → 610.24] The clarification was funny because I realized that other people might think the other way.
[610.24 → 611.58] So I'll give Yvonne a little look.
[611.96 → 612.80] And it's like a...
[612.80 → 613.78] It's like a...
[613.78 → 614.42] Wait for it.
[614.92 → 615.50] Wait for it.
[615.52 → 615.68] Look.
[616.60 → 617.92] So she walks up.
[619.52 → 619.92] Hi!
[620.48 → 622.28] My boyfriend is such a big fan!
[623.54 → 624.06] Or...
[624.06 → 624.50] Or...
[624.50 → 625.34] Here's the other one.
[626.44 → 627.32] Hey...
[627.32 → 631.38] My boyfriend was way too shy to come talk to you.
[631.44 → 632.52] Can you take a picture with him?
[632.52 → 635.16] Those are the two most common things.
[635.16 → 635.40] Yeah.
[635.64 → 639.34] And you can substitute boyfriend with husband or son.
[639.52 → 639.90] It's a fun...
[639.90 → 641.12] When it's not that, it's fun.
[641.18 → 641.94] Because it's like you...
[641.94 → 642.76] You found a...
[642.76 → 643.84] Like a rare...
[643.84 → 644.40] A rare Pokémon.
[644.40 → 645.30] A rare pull.
[645.46 → 645.72] Yeah.
[645.78 → 646.74] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[646.74 → 648.16] It's like, oh, sick!
[648.44 → 651.78] There's like one of our tiny female audiences.
[651.78 → 653.22] You are the 1%.
[653.22 → 653.62] Yeah.
[653.62 → 653.74] Yeah.
[653.74 → 654.60] It's like, heck yeah.
[657.24 → 658.02] Always fun.
[658.20 → 659.40] Like, wait, they do exist.
[659.58 → 660.24] Let's go.
[660.34 → 661.04] Yeah, yeah.
[661.04 → 661.90] We did it.
[662.66 → 665.10] Yeah, it's a good one.
[665.16 → 665.64] It's a good one.
[665.70 → 667.34] Anyway, anyway, let's carry on.
[668.42 → 675.08] In Schlep's video, he explains why he engages in this kind of vigilante justice.
[675.08 → 681.76] Which, I don't even know if I'd consider it to be fully vigilante if you are involving law enforcement.
[682.86 → 688.82] Like, it's certainly vigilante if you try to apprehend the person.
[689.66 → 690.64] You know, you...
[690.64 → 691.52] Yeah, I don't know.
[691.60 → 692.86] If you try to punish them.
[693.08 → 696.62] Like, if you try to play, you know, the role of judge, jury, executioner.
[696.68 → 697.64] You're judged, dread.
[699.06 → 701.64] But I don't know that I would necessarily...
[701.64 → 706.64] I don't know if I would necessarily agree.
[708.80 → 709.74] Yeah, because...
[709.74 → 720.16] So, vigilante's definition is a member of a self-appointed group of citizens who undertake law enforcement in their community without legal authority, typically because the legal agencies are thought to be inadequate.
[721.02 → 721.90] And I guess that's...
[721.90 → 723.44] They're taking a portion of it.
[723.62 → 723.96] Yeah.
[724.16 → 726.88] But they're not actually enforcing the law.
[727.34 → 727.62] Yeah.
[727.62 → 731.62] They're finding the person and then handing the information to enforce the law over to the cops.
[731.62 → 736.50] I don't know where the line on that ends up with, like, what they are.
[736.74 → 741.00] Like, does that mean they're a vigilante, even though they're not enforcing the law?
[741.10 → 746.68] Because I have seen situations where these people detain people for these types of things.
[746.68 → 746.96] Yeah.
[746.96 → 749.84] And that's enforcing the law to a certain degree.
[749.84 → 757.46] Okay, but we need to have a bit of a side conversation here because apparently it's vigilante, not vigilante.
[758.28 → 758.80] Yep.
[759.54 → 760.20] All right.
[760.60 → 761.34] What did I say?
[761.64 → 762.52] You said vigilante.
[762.80 → 763.02] Yeah.
[763.44 → 765.54] Yeah, apparently I said it wrong.
[765.64 → 767.36] I did another Linus.
[767.64 → 768.06] Oh, I don't know.
[768.06 → 769.36] Where I just assume...
[769.36 → 773.28] I assume, based on the spelling of this word, that it has kind of a French origin.
[774.72 → 775.80] So whack, dude.
[776.98 → 778.36] Yeah, that may be true.
[778.36 → 779.84] The term...
[779.84 → 783.74] Oh, it actually has Spanish origins, not French.
[784.36 → 787.20] So I don't know a lick of Spanish.
[787.44 → 789.88] So I have no idea how that...
[789.88 → 791.02] Yeah, exactly.
[793.16 → 794.16] One...
[794.16 → 795.12] UNO...
[795.12 → 795.56] UNO...
[795.56 → 796.88] UNO's taco.
[797.28 → 798.76] That's as far as I could get.
[798.78 → 801.36] UNO, dos, tree, Cairo, Cisco...
[802.62 → 803.04] Del mayo?
[803.04 → 809.16] And I only know that because the sublime song.
[812.44 → 818.14] So, yeah, I made the assumption based on the spelling that it had a French origin, which I was wrong about.
[818.14 → 822.80] And then if it had a French origin, my pronunciation wouldn't have been outlandish.
[823.96 → 825.48] I will keep that in mind.
[825.62 → 831.88] You guys have successfully vigilante-Justice me and enforced the law of English.
[831.88 → 840.44] But someone in Tulpinchot, Euro, said, that is like saying calling in a tip is vigilantism.
[840.60 → 842.72] And I don't think that is the equivalent.
[842.96 → 843.70] No, it's not.
[843.76 → 844.18] At all.
[844.18 → 848.26] Because you are actively engaging with the individual.
[848.46 → 864.20] So, I mean, I think it's more akin to seeing someone behaving suspiciously and then like following them in your car while you're like on the phone with the police with their hands free because it's 2025.
[864.20 → 869.34] And like, you know, trying to like to help them round them up.
[869.54 → 874.58] Like, or even going as far as like kind of steering them in one direction versus another direction.
[874.72 → 876.48] I remember one time literally driving home...
[876.48 → 879.22] Which cops will tell you not to do, generally speaking, from my understanding.
[879.34 → 879.70] Exactly.
[879.86 → 881.76] So, I was driving home from here one time.
[881.88 → 882.02] Yeah.
[882.08 → 887.90] And there was an obviously drunk driver who, if I remember correctly, they even like bumped a median at some point.
[887.98 → 889.92] Stuff like they were very obviously drunk.
[890.02 → 891.18] This was not distracted driving.
[891.40 → 892.40] This was impaired driving.
[892.40 → 897.60] And I called it in, and I was giving them updates on like where they were.
[898.26 → 899.98] And they were like, this is a weird traffic pattern.
[900.12 → 901.24] Are you following them?
[901.58 → 903.38] And then my brain was like calculating.
[903.62 → 904.72] And I was like, no.
[906.98 → 909.78] I am going home and...
[909.78 → 911.08] I'm afraid to pass them.
[911.38 → 911.62] Yeah.
[912.10 → 912.96] Something, something.
[913.30 → 915.42] And the person on the phone was like, hmm.
[916.28 → 916.72] Okay.
[916.86 → 922.38] And then I was like, yeah, I suspect I won't be able to keep giving you tasks.
[922.40 → 926.80] I was like, I'm going to be able to see them for long.
[926.80 → 928.12] And they were like, okay.
[928.12 → 934.20] And then I kept following them for, or going home for like, I think a minute or two.
[934.26 → 935.40] And then was like, this is going to get bad.
[935.44 → 936.10] So, I just bailed.
[936.30 → 939.00] But I bet you they were never caught because I had to bail.
[939.68 → 942.68] Because like, I was, it was very clear I was going to get in trouble.
[943.04 → 945.32] I'm a little surprised at how...
[945.94 → 947.32] For not following them.
[947.32 → 954.54] I'm a little surprised at how little we've seen law enforcement use just like cheap consumer drones for stuff like this.
[954.96 → 964.78] Like in cases where, you know, there's a really egregious speeding offence or where a high profile suspect is fleeing.
[964.78 → 967.10] Like they'll pull out a helicopter to like to chase them.
[967.14 → 969.10] And it's like, okay.
[969.10 → 973.90] But like, what if there was a middle, what if there was somewhere in between car and helicopter?
[974.76 → 976.34] And to be clear, I know it is a thing.
[976.40 → 978.20] I just mean, I'm surprised they don't do it more.
[978.60 → 979.84] No, I don't remember where.
[979.98 → 982.04] I thought it was in the UK, but I'm not sure where it is.
[982.10 → 984.58] They have like a drone unit.
[985.10 → 988.70] And they have like a tower somewhere in the city where they launch the drones from.
[989.30 → 990.42] And it's like a whole thing.
[990.48 → 991.46] But I don't remember where.
[991.56 → 992.08] Oh, interesting.
[992.28 → 993.12] I don't remember where it is.
[993.12 → 995.06] I watched like a little mini doc on it.
[996.66 → 999.06] Lobster says the range on them is just not that great.
[999.50 → 1004.16] But like, I mean, yeah, it doesn't have to be that great.
[1004.28 → 1005.84] Like they're so low cost.
[1006.74 → 1009.54] If you just had like a little landing pad on like.
[1009.54 → 1010.34] Especially these days.
[1010.40 → 1011.80] Unlike every police station.
[1012.02 → 1012.30] Yeah.
[1012.30 → 1015.28] Like to be clear, I'm not saying.
[1015.52 → 1018.76] Compared to literally sending out a helicopter one time.
[1020.08 → 1022.64] Beta 588 says they do it lots in California, apparently.
[1023.12 → 1023.38] Yeah.
[1023.50 → 1024.38] And I was.
[1024.58 → 1026.62] I don't know if this is the one I was talking about, but I was right.
[1026.74 → 1028.88] Apparently the UK does have like a drone unit.
[1029.02 → 1029.14] Yeah.
[1029.20 → 1032.34] And Kill Ninja says they do drones when the PERP is on foot.
[1032.64 → 1034.98] So it might be like a speed issue then.
[1037.52 → 1037.88] Interesting.
[1038.38 → 1038.62] Yeah.
[1038.70 → 1038.94] Okay.
[1039.00 → 1040.68] Florida's rolling them out as well as some other places.
[1040.82 → 1041.20] There you go.
[1046.42 → 1048.44] Atrium says helicopter maintenance is expensive.
[1048.56 → 1049.18] Yeah, exactly.
[1049.74 → 1050.42] That's what I'm saying.
[1050.42 → 1050.82] Exactly.
[1050.82 → 1052.82] You send out the helicopter one time.
[1053.12 → 1055.46] Uh, and you could have bought a bunch of drones.
[1055.74 → 1055.98] Yeah.
[1056.10 → 1056.96] To be honest.
[1059.04 → 1059.62] All right.
[1059.66 → 1061.18] Anyway, back to, back to the topic.
[1061.46 → 1066.26] Um, anyway, in Schlep's video, he explains why he does this.
[1066.26 → 1068.52] It starts because he cares about Roblox.
[1068.66 → 1072.80] Um, since it was not only his favourite game growing up, but also because he met his current
[1072.80 → 1073.76] girlfriend through the platform.
[1073.76 → 1075.46] So it has kind of a special place in his heart.
[1075.46 → 1079.40] But, and this is where things get a little bit more kind of real.
[1079.88 → 1088.16] Um, it's also because when he was playing, when he was younger, he was a victim of some
[1088.16 → 1088.74] of these predators.
[1089.08 → 1093.44] So he feels it's right to make sure that no child goes through the same thing.
[1093.44 → 1100.10] Schlep is now banned from ever accessing Roblox again, even on his family friendly channel
[1100.10 → 1101.56] where he just casually plays the game.
[1101.56 → 1105.44] Uh, if you are interested in learning more and doing some research for yourself, he has
[1105.44 → 1109.52] a website, schlepp.tv, where you can support his content over there as he continues on this
[1109.52 → 1109.78] journey.
[1109.78 → 1117.12] Um, here's some extra Roblox stats according to the demand stage.com 380 million monthly
[1117.12 → 1122.50] active users, 85.3 million daily active users.
[1123.06 → 1125.26] Now I do suspect that's a little juiced.
[1125.34 → 1128.02] Um, I, I was looking at, uh, heard some stats.
[1128.10 → 1129.30] It's like more than half juiced.
[1129.48 → 1136.12] My, my son's computer, um, like his monitor wasn't off when he was away at camp for a week.
[1136.42 → 1139.06] And I was like, why isn't his monitor turning off?
[1139.06 → 1142.26] So I went to go like power CFG, like why what's keeping it away?
[1142.32 → 1147.24] And I was like, oh, there was a dragged down like idle game in the bottom corner.
[1147.60 → 1154.64] So like, I mean, if there's a lot of that going on, I, which there certainly is, which
[1154.64 → 1157.24] there certainly is, then this may not be quite neat.
[1158.52 → 1165.70] It's also like, as far as I know, like super batted, I mean, everything is these days,
[1165.70 → 1171.66] but like, but there's an estimated 32 and a half million of those 85 million monthly
[1171.66 → 1176.82] or daily active users that are supposed to be apparently under the age of 13.
[1177.92 → 1178.36] Wow.
[1179.20 → 1183.92] Uh, so our discussion question then is Chris Hansen wildly increased the popularity of
[1183.92 → 1185.44] vigilantism against child predators.
[1185.44 → 1190.00] And for many years now, we've seen people on all sorts of platforms like Twitch, Kick,
[1190.12 → 1192.96] Roblox, YouTube, et cetera, attempt to do the same thing.
[1193.10 → 1194.34] Here's, here's a question though.
[1194.72 → 1198.28] Is Chris Hansen a vigilante?
[1198.94 → 1201.50] Because he, the cops would arrest the person.
[1201.70 → 1204.48] As far as my understanding goes, Chris Hansen never touched anybody.
[1204.94 → 1205.24] Yeah.
[1205.40 → 1206.48] He just talked to them.
[1206.48 → 1210.08] Yeah, no, I, I, I would, I would say no.
[1210.30 → 1213.22] I don't know like what the, the legal line is.
[1213.26 → 1216.36] But what he sure as heck isn't is a law enforcement officer.
[1216.76 → 1217.14] Totally.
[1217.28 → 1219.08] So he didn't enforce the law either.
[1219.20 → 1223.24] I certainly see, I certainly see why people would draw a parallel.
[1224.04 → 1225.50] So I can say that much.
[1225.62 → 1229.10] He, he is like detected, he found, he didn't enforce.
[1230.70 → 1231.48] But then I would.
[1231.64 → 1234.72] He did it in direct association with law enforcement rather than doing it.
[1234.72 → 1237.70] And then turning over data.
[1240.80 → 1249.24] But then is that just, are we basically saying, Hey, law enforcement needs to kind of get it together and work with people on this then?
[1250.28 → 1256.42] Like if, if, if people are willing to do it for free and all they have to do is kind of have a department that is like.
[1257.04 → 1257.54] Overseeing it.
[1257.56 → 1258.42] Hey, yeah, sure.
[1258.52 → 1261.70] But then they're, they might be responsible for what some of these people do.
[1261.70 → 1264.14] And some of them are like deeply not okay.
[1264.14 → 1264.62] Okay.
[1264.62 → 1264.84] Oh yeah.
[1267.72 → 1268.28] Okay.
[1268.52 → 1270.36] I wasn't finished my discussion question though.
[1270.50 → 1270.84] Okay.
[1271.06 → 1273.84] The discussion question is a, is a spicy one.
[1273.84 → 1288.86] Are you in support of vigilantism or do you agree with the stance of Roblox and others that doing this often leads to no actual charges because of doing this?
[1289.12 → 1292.32] Like because you are not necessarily like doing it properly.
[1292.54 → 1295.34] It can, it can make it difficult to charge these people.
[1295.60 → 1296.24] Hold on.
[1296.24 → 1302.52] Hasn't he been successful by?
[1304.04 → 1304.46] He has.
[1304.46 → 1306.68] Has been successful in working with local police.
[1306.90 → 1308.10] So that's just not true.
[1308.26 → 1312.94] He has been, but that's, but, but to be clear, we're talking more broadly, more broadly speaking.
[1312.94 → 1319.54] I think a lot of the times this kind of vigilantism can create problems with the legal case that can allow these people to walk free.
[1319.54 → 1335.48] I think one big problem with this question in general is that it's such a any group that you can freely join or enter without anyone's input at all is a problem.
[1335.48 → 1335.92] Yeah.
[1335.92 → 1336.60] Yeah.
[1336.60 → 1337.24] Always.
[1337.70 → 1337.90] Yep.
[1338.00 → 1343.18] Because any bad actor can join and do things under the banner at any time.
[1343.48 → 1343.64] Yep.
[1343.66 → 1355.86] And especially a thing like this where the banner is, hey, we are trying to do an objectively universal good, which is stopping children from being preyed upon.
[1356.06 → 1356.28] Yep.
[1356.66 → 1360.34] That banner is a pretty NATO banner.
[1360.50 → 1360.82] However.
[1360.82 → 1364.76] For someone with bad intentions to go, oh, I was doing good things.
[1364.76 → 1364.80] Yes.
[1365.18 → 1366.70] So like, it's, it's dangerous.
[1366.70 → 1368.40] It's hard to say universally.
[1369.42 → 1370.38] Yes, this is okay.
[1370.46 → 1371.24] People should do it.
[1372.30 → 1385.18] I think it would be really great if there were programs where you could work with the cops, and they were overseeing what you were doing, and they had to be able to like, be able to have access to all of your chat logs and everything and like all that kind of stuff and make sure that it was all above board.
[1385.68 → 1388.90] Because I think things could go bad quick.
[1388.90 → 1395.50] And you should be like, if you do bad things while doing that, you should get in trouble just like anyone else would.
[1398.22 → 1398.70] Yeah.
[1398.96 → 1402.46] Yeah, man, this is, this is tough.
[1402.46 → 1413.64] Because there, as far as my understanding goes, there have been genuinely innocent people caught and lives ruined over, you know, whatever assumptions.
[1413.64 → 1418.12] Um, I don't know how much that's people hiding behind that.
[1418.24 → 1418.90] Yeah, it's hard to say.
[1418.90 → 1423.76] Because their case got thrown out of court because something happened incorrectly, and then they said, oh, it got thrown out of court.
[1423.84 → 1424.52] That means I'm innocent.
[1424.74 → 1425.40] But due process.
[1425.62 → 1426.06] Even if they're not.
[1426.06 → 1428.70] As inconvenient as it might be, does exist for a reason.
[1428.70 → 1429.28] It's very important.
[1429.86 → 1430.04] Yeah.
[1431.04 → 1438.60] I, so that's why I, I, I, when I hear this thing of like, he's not actually doing any of the enforcement.
[1438.78 → 1442.48] He's just gathering chat logs and handing over to the police, and it has been successful.
[1442.48 → 1444.38] To me, that's like huge W.
[1445.46 → 1445.94] That's fantastic.
[1445.94 → 1450.70] Jamie Cullen says, had a neighbour get questioned live on Facebook by a predator hunter group.
[1451.18 → 1452.80] False accusations ruined him.
[1454.02 → 1454.62] Yeah, that's rough.
[1454.62 → 1457.50] And hopefully your neighbour actually wasn't involved in any of that stuff.
[1457.60 → 1461.34] And, you know, I don't, I don't know.
[1461.46 → 1462.68] I wasn't, I wasn't there.
[1462.80 → 1464.68] I, I didn't, didn't see any of it.
[1465.10 → 1467.74] Um, but if that's the case, that's, that's horrible.
[1468.28 → 1472.98] That is a that is a completely unacceptable collateral damage outcome.
[1473.68 → 1478.88] Like you can't, you can't blow up hospitals because a couple of bad guys might be in there.
[1479.44 → 1480.56] Well, it's true.
[1480.78 → 1481.52] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1482.16 → 1482.86] No, I agree.
[1482.86 → 1487.36] So like it's, uh, that's where it gets.
[1487.72 → 1488.64] Not everyone agrees.
[1492.64 → 1493.04] Yeah.
[1493.82 → 1496.84] I think that's as close as we're going to get to that topic literally ever.
[1496.84 → 1497.02] Yeah.
[1497.02 → 1497.26] Yeah.
[1500.76 → 1501.16] Yeah.
[1501.22 → 1507.20] But I mean, uh, that's, um, it's, it does make it tough.
[1507.32 → 1510.44] I think it would be good if there are routes.
[1511.32 → 1514.56] Um, cause like neighbourhood watches are a sanctioned thing, right?
[1514.98 → 1515.28] Oh yeah.
[1515.98 → 1516.28] Oh yeah.
[1516.28 → 1516.86] That's true.
[1516.86 → 1519.04] Like there are versions of this.
[1519.10 → 1519.24] Yeah.
[1519.32 → 1520.44] So why don't we just do it?
[1520.50 → 1523.08] What's the neighbourhood watch equivalent of that?
[1523.82 → 1524.32] I don't know.
[1524.44 → 1525.18] I don't know either.
[1525.98 → 1527.04] Cause that's totally a thing.
[1527.04 → 1529.90] And like there are things as the neighbourhood watch that you can't do.
[1530.00 → 1534.08] Cause like I, you could make the argument that cause the neighbourhood watch you're, you're in your home, right?
[1534.08 → 1536.72] So it's, there's, there's a certain sort of like, like property.
[1537.48 → 1538.40] You're not just in your home.
[1538.46 → 1539.18] They do patrol and stuff.
[1539.26 → 1539.94] They do patrols.
[1539.98 → 1541.08] Some of them do patrols.
[1542.36 → 1543.78] They'll walk through alleys and stuff.
[1543.78 → 1544.02] Sorry.
[1544.08 → 1547.06] I don't, I don't necessarily mean your personal property.
[1547.14 → 1549.50] Like, I mean, you are, you're, you're on your turf.
[1550.00 → 1552.76] Like there's a, there's a, there's almost like a stand your ground.
[1552.76 → 1553.10] I understand.
[1553.28 → 1553.90] I misunderstood.
[1554.12 → 1554.28] I got it.
[1554.30 → 1555.74] Home defence element of it.
[1555.90 → 1559.94] But like, why wouldn't that necessarily extend to my online domain?
[1560.60 → 1563.88] And I don't mean a domain, a literal domain like.com.
[1563.88 → 1567.64] I mean, like, like my online, I don't know.
[1567.72 → 1575.64] I don't know how to describe it other than my, my, my turf, my, my zone, my, my chill hangouts, you know?
[1576.22 → 1576.58] Yeah.
[1576.94 → 1581.18] To add to this, Pinky Draws said, and I love this story.
[1581.38 → 1583.52] Well, it's not a good story, but it's a very interesting one.
[1583.54 → 1584.64] And I reference it all the time.
[1585.08 → 1588.62] Reddit has a famous story where they went after a kid they thought did the Boston bombings,
[1588.64 → 1593.18] but it turns out the kid committed suicide unrelated to the event and Reddit started going after their family.
[1593.18 → 1595.38] That's the whole, we did it Reddit reference.
[1595.82 → 1596.10] Yeah, I know.
[1596.20 → 1598.00] Like, yeah, that was brutal.
[1598.34 → 1608.06] There are, there are clear and obvious downsides to just like deciding that somebody did something without going through any form of like real proper process.
[1608.06 → 1615.02] And then social just icing the heck out of them when they, they possibly didn't do it.
[1615.06 → 1616.62] Like it's, it's, it's rough.
[1617.20 → 1625.94] That being said, I like the idea if they're going to work with law enforcement, and they're going to try to do it as properly as you can.
[1625.94 → 1627.44] No system's ever going to be perfect.
[1627.54 → 1633.04] But if they genuinely try to do it as properly as they can, from what I've read, it sounds like Schlep is doing that.
[1633.38 → 1634.40] I think that's cool.
[1634.60 → 1638.80] So I'm not going to say a blanket like vigilante justice is good.
[1639.54 → 1641.20] So you don't stand with Spider-Man?
[1642.02 → 1642.46] I see.
[1642.46 → 1644.82] But I would.
[1646.00 → 1647.08] So that's tough then.
[1647.48 → 1647.70] Yeah.
[1647.88 → 1651.46] But not all these people are Spider-Man, which is the problem.
[1651.82 → 1652.00] Right.
[1652.08 → 1657.54] Some of these people are terrible people going, oh, there's a banner that makes everyone think I'm good and then acting terribly.
[1657.68 → 1659.30] That is absolutely a thing that's happening.
[1659.56 → 1661.24] So it's, it's a it's touchy ground.
[1661.46 → 1664.94] I think a sanctioned, sanctioned group would be cool.
[1665.20 → 1670.78] Having like, they should even go, you know, the old like neighbourhood watch signage that like looked kind of cool.
[1670.78 → 1672.54] Yeah.
[1672.74 → 1674.16] They should do that and make it like.
[1674.16 → 1676.22] The guy with the hat or whatever, right?
[1676.34 → 1676.62] Yeah.
[1676.80 → 1676.98] Yeah.
[1676.98 → 1677.14] Yeah.
[1677.14 → 1677.36] Yeah.
[1677.36 → 1682.52] They should do, they should do that and make it like, or similar to that and make it like internet watch.
[1683.82 → 1685.04] Remember the watch sign?
[1685.82 → 1686.36] Hold on.
[1686.70 → 1687.00] Okay.
[1687.06 → 1688.76] Apparently there's a movie called that.
[1689.06 → 1689.32] Yeah.
[1689.36 → 1689.52] Yeah.
[1689.52 → 1689.76] Yeah.
[1689.86 → 1691.62] The guy that looked like a Canadian.
[1691.84 → 1692.12] Yeah.
[1693.80 → 1694.48] Hey buddy.
[1694.90 → 1696.00] That's his jacket.
[1696.24 → 1696.94] Get out of here, guy.
[1697.02 → 1697.98] But I do agree.
[1697.98 → 1700.24] I'm going to do crime.
[1700.50 → 1700.82] Yeah.
[1701.70 → 1702.90] I'm going to do crime.
[1703.42 → 1704.92] But yeah, that logo was sick.
[1705.26 → 1709.12] Do, do like something kind of similar to that, but make them like add a computer or something
[1709.12 → 1711.60] and make it internet watch.
[1711.76 → 1712.64] I think that'd be dope.
[1712.70 → 1714.28] Cause yeah, like screw this stuff, man.
[1717.20 → 1717.90] It's not good.
[1717.90 → 1719.00] All right.
[1719.00 → 1723.06] All right.
[1723.16 → 1726.64] Why don't we move on to our next topic, Dan?
[1727.06 → 1728.54] Are you not tracking time today?
[1728.54 → 1730.78] You are perfectly on time.
[1730.84 → 1731.40] No.
[1732.06 → 1733.70] One minute, 26 seconds.
[1733.90 → 1734.74] That's impossible.
[1735.66 → 1737.44] So this is, I adjusted some of the time.
[1737.56 → 1737.96] Perfect.
[1738.64 → 1739.04] Okay.
[1739.16 → 1740.26] Perfect job, sir.
[1740.78 → 1741.58] Aw, thank you.
[1741.58 → 1745.54] Speaking of not being your buddy, friend.
[1752.96 → 1753.40] Oh.
[1753.52 → 1753.96] Where are we going?
[1754.06 → 1754.20] Yeah.
[1754.28 → 1759.22] The first word of this was the wrong word, which is why I couldn't read it.
[1759.22 → 1765.22] While Steam has been having issues with MasterCard and Visa, threatening to pull payment processing
[1765.22 → 1772.22] due to adult content, allegedly, Steam has been quietly fighting with PayPal at the same
[1772.22 → 1772.80] time.
[1773.56 → 1777.80] Users trying to purchase games with PayPal are receiving an error message that reads,
[1778.04 → 1782.74] We are temporarily unable to process transactions with this payment method at this time.
[1783.56 → 1787.96] The earliest reports that PC Gamer could dig up show this issue appearing as early as a
[1787.96 → 1791.44] month ago in countries like the EU and also Mexico.
[1792.14 → 1797.64] While some theorized that these PayPal issues may have been related to the NSFW crackdown,
[1798.10 → 1801.54] a new pop-up message clearly states the problem.
[1802.44 → 1803.34] And here it is.
[1803.76 → 1813.40] In early July 2025, which aligns with what PC Gamer was able to find, PayPal notified Valve
[1813.40 → 1821.50] that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the
[1821.50 → 1824.90] processing of any transactions related to Steam.
[1825.40 → 1832.90] This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than Euro, CAD, GBP, Japanese
[1832.90 → 1836.10] Yen, Australian Dollars, and US Dollars.
[1836.50 → 1841.94] We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future, but the timeline is
[1841.94 → 1842.72] uncertain.
[1843.16 → 1848.88] We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected
[1848.88 → 1849.70] by this.
[1850.54 → 1853.74] So that's all a quote from the new pop-up message.
[1854.90 → 1856.30] Is this PayPal's fault?
[1857.40 → 1858.30] Hard to say.
[1858.42 → 1859.82] What's the acquiring bank?
[1860.08 → 1861.22] Here's some ignorance for you.
[1861.78 → 1863.32] Uh, not in my notes.
[1863.84 → 1864.28] Got it.
[1864.36 → 1864.80] Cool chat.
[1864.80 → 1867.42] On August 14th, a Valve spokesperson...
[1867.42 → 1869.24] No, like, sorry, what is an acquiring bank?
[1869.96 → 1870.34] I don't know.
[1870.90 → 1871.16] Okay.
[1871.66 → 1872.50] Yep, you can look it up.
[1873.46 → 1875.28] I'll, let me, let me go through the notes for the rest.
[1876.00 → 1882.18] Um, on August 14th, a Valve spokesperson confirmed to Rock Paper Shotgun that the withdrawal of
[1882.18 → 1888.60] support from the acquiring bank is regarding content on Steam and is related to what we've
[1888.60 → 1892.50] previously commented on surrounding MasterCard.
[1896.22 → 1896.78] Wow.
[1897.62 → 1898.06] Okay.
[1898.88 → 1902.18] Acquiring bank is the bank that, like, gets the funds from the credit card.
[1902.32 → 1902.64] Okay.
[1902.64 → 1906.92] So basically, we have yet another situation...
[1906.92 → 1907.32] It's down the chain.
[1907.38 → 1916.98] ...where financial institutions are dictating what we can or cannot buy with our f***ING
[1916.98 → 1917.84] money.
[1918.92 → 1923.08] I'm just, I'm just trying to say, I am one of the first people to step up to bat whenever
[1923.08 → 1926.06] a hating PayPal competition begins.
[1926.54 → 1928.88] This doesn't necessarily seem like it's PayPal.
[1929.14 → 1930.76] No, it does not appear to be...
[1930.76 → 1932.18] I'm just trying to be real.
[1932.64 → 1937.78] Uh, this feels like PayPal is passing on a problem from these acquiring banks.
[1938.62 → 1945.28] Um, and I'm just, I'm having a hard time trying to, trying to wrap my brain around this.
[1945.38 → 1946.64] Like, is the concern...
[1947.50 → 1952.44] Because we've talked on the show before, but we'll do a bit of a sort of recap here.
[1952.86 → 1958.28] Um, OnlyFans ran into big challenges with payment processors like Stripe, um, where they
[1958.28 → 1962.20] were allegedly being pressured from upstream.
[1962.68 → 1966.88] Um, so this would have been coming from the credit card companies, I guess, maybe, or maybe
[1966.88 → 1967.90] coming from farther upstream.
[1968.36 → 1971.92] It's very hard to say because the whole thing is kind of shrouded in secrecy.
[1972.08 → 1977.70] But they were getting pressure, um, not to allow, uh, payments through OnlyFans.
[1977.70 → 1979.48] And then they saw how much money it was, and they backed it down.
[1979.92 → 1985.14] It's basically how it went because there are no principles once the dollar value gets high enough.
[1985.72 → 1989.68] Um, and it turns out the whole thing was just pure hypocrisy.
[1990.18 → 1993.70] So, anywho, um...
[1994.44 → 1995.58] Shoot, where was I going with this?
[1995.58 → 1998.46] Don't remember.
[2001.14 → 2002.18] Cool, we disagree.
[2003.94 → 2005.12] Wait, we disagree on what?
[2005.36 → 2006.02] I don't remember.
[2006.22 → 2006.50] Nice.
[2006.92 → 2008.10] I'm so tired, dude.
[2008.42 → 2011.70] It's been, it's been yet another very long week.
[2011.72 → 2013.78] I wish I could help you back to where we came from, but...
[2013.78 → 2014.46] Yeah, I don't remember.
[2014.58 → 2014.96] I don't know.
[2015.08 → 2018.88] We were talking about how it's not, it's not really a PayPal thing.
[2019.88 → 2024.16] Um, no one else in chat seems to have the answer either.
[2024.16 → 2024.82] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2024.82 → 2025.28] I remember.
[2025.58 → 2026.46] Okay, okay.
[2026.78 → 2028.80] So, so this is, so this is a thing.
[2028.80 → 2036.10] And as far as I can tell, the best kind of rationale in, in these various situations that I've heard,
[2036.26 → 2043.34] is that these brands don't want their logo associated with certain types of content.
[2043.64 → 2048.24] Like, let's say, for instance, that you were an escort.
[2049.10 → 2050.70] Which, I mean...
[2050.70 → 2051.58] You don't know I'm not.
[2052.66 → 2053.76] You don't know I'm not.
[2054.00 → 2054.82] Give him a little, give him a little,
[2054.82 → 2056.32] give him a little, give him a little pout.
[2056.44 → 2057.18] What's the what's the...
[2057.18 → 2057.74] A pout?
[2058.04 → 2058.20] Yeah.
[2058.40 → 2059.56] It might be a different type of escort.
[2059.62 → 2060.58] Well, it doesn't matter.
[2061.60 → 2063.28] The point is, look at this.
[2063.42 → 2064.24] Come on, come on, wink at us.
[2064.50 → 2065.08] Yeah, come on.
[2065.16 → 2065.90] Look right into the camera.
[2066.02 → 2066.44] Give us a little...
[2066.44 → 2067.12] I can't wink.
[2067.18 → 2067.96] I can't wink at all.
[2068.14 → 2068.88] Oh, just a little eyebrow.
[2069.08 → 2069.62] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2069.62 → 2070.26] Yes, he can.
[2070.70 → 2071.10] See?
[2071.30 → 2071.74] Damn.
[2071.82 → 2072.00] See?
[2072.56 → 2072.96] Damn.
[2073.06 → 2073.62] I can't.
[2074.32 → 2075.86] Executes it expertly.
[2075.86 → 2076.12] Did I?
[2076.24 → 2077.52] Because usually I just blink both eyes.
[2078.14 → 2079.04] It looked good.
[2079.16 → 2079.74] Okay, sure.
[2079.88 → 2080.20] It looked good.
[2080.20 → 2080.50] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2080.50 → 2080.78] Nice.
[2081.42 → 2081.84] You're fire.
[2082.92 → 2085.46] So, so let's say you're an escort.
[2085.74 → 2085.94] Sure.
[2085.94 → 2091.60] And you basically had like a, like a, you, you...
[2091.60 → 2092.52] Bears are us.
[2099.86 → 2101.34] Sorry, I had to brand it.
[2101.66 → 2102.76] You just gotta do it.
[2102.94 → 2104.70] So, so you're on...
[2104.70 → 2107.70] So, so your profile...
[2107.70 → 2110.90] All right, sorry.
[2111.00 → 2111.40] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2111.82 → 2115.66] So your profile on a list of some sort, you know,
[2115.66 → 2116.52] has a...
[2116.52 → 2117.26] You're wearing a...
[2117.26 → 2119.58] You're wearing a shirt that's like,
[2119.86 → 2121.58] I accept MasterCard.
[2121.94 → 2123.28] Or something like that.
[2123.50 → 2123.82] You know?
[2125.16 → 2126.58] Give me your MasterCard.
[2126.82 → 2127.16] I...
[2127.16 → 2128.30] Well, that's the thing.
[2129.22 → 2130.02] That's the thing.
[2130.96 → 2131.52] Just...
[2131.52 → 2133.60] Swipe.
[2133.90 → 2135.02] Yeah, they're actually...
[2135.02 → 2135.84] It's sweatpants.
[2136.36 → 2137.08] It's the...
[2137.08 → 2141.34] Remember the like butt print that used to be on sweatpants?
[2144.94 → 2145.38] No.
[2145.66 → 2148.16] So...
[2148.16 → 2148.80] Not down.
[2149.02 → 2149.32] Okay.
[2149.58 → 2151.20] So anyway, that's your profile.
[2153.04 → 2159.16] The argument that these brands seem to be making is that they do not want that kind of association.
[2159.44 → 2160.48] They don't want to be associated.
[2160.62 → 2163.56] So obviously it wouldn't be quite as direct as that.
[2163.58 → 2164.26] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2164.26 → 2168.44] But on this undesirable content, their logo would appear.
[2168.44 → 2178.76] And logo placement and associated content, like it or not, agree or not, there's a high degree of brand sensitivity around it.
[2178.76 → 2179.60] There are tons, dude.
[2179.62 → 2184.50] You can look up style guides on how you have to use different brands' logos, and they're like...
[2184.50 → 2190.26] How much spacing there needs to be around it, what colour backgrounds, the various versions of it are allowed to be on.
[2190.38 → 2191.76] It's painful, actually.
[2191.90 → 2192.72] It's actually quite extensive.
[2192.88 → 2193.32] But...
[2193.32 → 2195.20] Most people just ignore it.
[2195.20 → 2200.66] But when you have a strong brand, I can understand the desire to protect it.
[2200.66 → 2203.66] However, let me just...
[2203.66 → 2209.56] Let me just, you know, for the sake of argument, say something.
[2211.14 → 2216.06] I don't give two shits about MasterCard or Visa's brand.
[2217.20 → 2221.66] Is there anyone out there that's like, wow, I like...
[2222.30 → 2225.50] There's got to be somebody, but I hear what you're saying and I agree.
[2225.50 → 2226.24] I like PayPal.
[2227.40 → 2229.88] I go out of my way to use PayPal.
[2229.88 → 2232.10] Okay, I actually do know people that are like that.
[2232.20 → 2236.90] It's usually because in their country, for whatever reason, credit cards are difficult.
[2239.32 → 2244.66] And they use PayPal as like a credit card workaround for web payments.
[2245.78 → 2248.38] IXFN724 says, I'm a slut for Diners Club.
[2251.08 → 2251.84] Is that...
[2251.84 → 2253.22] But that's not Visa or MasterCard.
[2253.36 → 2254.10] No, they're equivalent.
[2254.24 → 2255.20] That's a sub-brand, isn't it?
[2256.12 → 2257.08] No, Diners Club.
[2257.08 → 2258.64] And like Diners Club, Discover.
[2258.64 → 2260.42] Like there's other credit card brands.
[2260.52 → 2264.72] But they're all running on the Visa and MasterCard backends.
[2265.52 → 2266.60] Is Diners Club running on...
[2266.60 → 2267.38] Cirrus and whatever else.
[2267.50 → 2268.24] I bet you.
[2268.46 → 2270.54] Oh, they're probably on the same back end, but I don't...
[2270.54 → 2272.24] Yeah, because Cirrus is just MasterCard.
[2273.20 → 2275.70] It's like NVIDIA selling an NVIDIA branded GPU.
[2277.04 → 2279.96] Like MasterCard, Cirrus has their own card and it's MasterCard.
[2279.96 → 2280.38] Oh, okay.
[2280.42 → 2283.84] So I'm confused because Diners wasn't at some point, but maybe they are now.
[2283.84 → 2285.86] And Discover is their own network.
[2285.94 → 2286.66] Same with MX.
[2287.82 → 2288.14] Ah.
[2288.60 → 2288.74] Yeah.
[2288.92 → 2290.64] So no, there are more.
[2290.78 → 2292.12] It is not quite...
[2292.12 → 2293.06] It's not just the two.
[2293.08 → 2293.42] A duopoly.
[2293.58 → 2295.00] Yeah, I'm not like super up to speed on this.
[2295.12 → 2296.48] Yeah, it's not quite a duopoly.
[2297.14 → 2298.22] Says chat.
[2298.50 → 2299.36] So make of that what you will.
[2299.52 → 2300.94] No, they're probably...
[2300.94 → 2301.80] But like these...
[2301.80 → 2303.80] These...
[2303.80 → 2305.12] Diners Club is...
[2305.12 → 2307.12] These brands, like are...
[2308.12 → 2315.04] Is it not doing more damage to them that they are interfering with us spending our own money
[2315.04 → 2320.14] on whatever it is that we want versus having their logo next to something?
[2320.22 → 2321.80] Why don't they just say, don't show our logo?
[2322.12 → 2328.36] Honestly, even with the fact that there is more than two and two is already more than one,
[2328.54 → 2333.40] I think the effective monopoly that these players have, they just don't care.
[2333.40 → 2335.12] At all.
[2335.14 → 2336.00] But they do seem to care.
[2336.08 → 2336.84] That's the thing.
[2337.74 → 2338.92] Why do they care?
[2339.02 → 2340.24] That's what I'm trying to figure out.
[2340.26 → 2341.26] To me, it's always felt like a power move.
[2341.26 → 2342.64] We already hate you anyway.
[2343.20 → 2343.42] Yeah.
[2343.56 → 2344.98] Like we hate you anyway.
[2345.56 → 2350.80] You literally just like sit and scrape off of every transaction.
[2351.18 → 2352.40] I've actually been...
[2352.40 → 2354.90] I've been thinking about it more lately.
[2355.58 → 2362.52] And I often forget because it's so convenient because it's the one I keep at the front of my wallet.
[2362.52 → 2363.06] But you know what?
[2363.08 → 2363.84] I'm going to do it now.
[2364.26 → 2367.16] I'm going to move my debit card to the front of my wallet.
[2368.66 → 2371.70] Because why would I use my credit card?
[2373.72 → 2380.24] It literally just costs whoever I'm buying from anywhere from an additional...
[2380.24 → 2383.10] Oh, that's kind of a pretty based way to see it.
[2383.46 → 2384.06] Like...
[2384.06 → 2384.58] I like that.
[2385.20 → 2385.86] That's cool.
[2386.46 → 2387.26] Like it's brutal.
[2387.56 → 2388.16] They're just...
[2388.16 → 2389.32] So you get points for yourself.
[2389.48 → 2392.58] Yeah, because what I could do is I could just...
[2392.58 → 2395.86] Because like my points, like I'll get like a 1% cash back.
[2396.48 → 2400.90] But why don't I just use my debit card and then tip 19%?
[2402.80 → 2404.52] It's effectively the same thing.
[2404.64 → 2404.86] Yeah.
[2405.12 → 2406.48] But I give Visa nothing.
[2406.98 → 2407.24] Yeah.
[2408.42 → 2408.98] Kind of sick.
[2409.74 → 2410.22] Kind of sick.
[2410.22 → 2413.06] People are saying extended warranties, buyer protection.
[2413.58 → 2413.80] Yep.
[2414.04 → 2414.36] Yep.
[2414.52 → 2415.50] It can be very useful.
[2415.80 → 2416.52] Fraud protection.
[2417.04 → 2418.02] Can be very useful.
[2418.20 → 2419.48] Fair cards have more security in general.
[2420.66 → 2421.92] I don't know about more security.
[2422.48 → 2423.32] Not sure if I buy that.
[2423.32 → 2428.04] They have more like, I would say like insurances on having issues with them.
[2428.82 → 2430.08] Yeah, that can be true.
[2430.40 → 2431.82] Not necessarily more security.
[2431.86 → 2432.46] Okay, fine.
[2432.54 → 2434.06] So they're providing a valuable service.
[2434.18 → 2436.70] But what gives them the right to decide where I can spend my money?
[2436.84 → 2437.74] That's my objection.
[2438.10 → 2438.84] Do debit cards.
[2439.96 → 2440.64] Not that I'm aware of.
[2440.64 → 2443.34] Because this one said the acquiring bank was the problem.
[2444.08 → 2447.12] So could a debit card that you have with a bank do this?
[2447.16 → 2448.84] Is there any place that has that problem?
[2449.64 → 2451.46] Debit cards use the same payment networks.
[2451.46 → 2455.42] I've got a merch message here that's kind of related to that in a way.
[2456.02 → 2459.36] With regard to the PayPal situation, should a bank be allowed to choose its customers?
[2460.44 → 2461.68] I mean, I'm pretty sure they do.
[2461.90 → 2465.04] You can't have proceeds of crimes or drugs and stuff like that.
[2465.20 → 2467.72] You might not be able to get a loan or something if you don't.
[2467.74 → 2471.14] I don't think they're allowed to choose that, though.
[2471.28 → 2481.54] I think that's like they're like I know that there 's's there's a big conversation in the States right now around banks supposed previous discriminatory practices.
[2481.80 → 2487.16] Alleged, alleged discriminatory practices around being allowed to choose their own customers.
[2487.16 → 2501.22] And it looks like the consensus is that while there has been a sort of right for banks to choose their own customers, though, that may not necessarily be the case going forward.
[2501.22 → 2508.26] So it seems like there is at least some momentum towards no, you actually are not like allowed to choose who banks with you.
[2508.26 → 2511.60] What does that mean?
[2513.66 → 2515.18] How does that get enforced?
[2516.14 → 2517.88] What does banking constitute?
[2518.92 → 2520.70] Does bank include getting a loan?
[2521.74 → 2524.46] Because they have to be able to choose who they give loans to.
[2524.80 → 2527.66] But not choose based on any sort of...
[2528.32 → 2529.34] How do you police that?
[2530.84 → 2533.42] Luke, I don't have the answers to this.
[2533.42 → 2534.88] Because you're going to have like an interview.
[2536.70 → 2536.96] None.
[2537.22 → 2539.98] Or they're going to read your name on a document.
[2540.32 → 2541.28] Yeah, you'll have that.
[2541.82 → 2545.80] I mean, I think that's a big part of why these institutions hide behind algorithms.
[2546.44 → 2549.66] Because then they can just be like, well, I didn't know what colour.
[2549.84 → 2550.32] Computer says no.
[2550.38 → 2551.68] I didn't know what colour their skin was.
[2551.92 → 2552.16] Yeah.
[2552.16 → 2555.66] I just, all I knew was the neighbourhood they lived in.
[2555.94 → 2557.28] And the school they went to.
[2558.18 → 2560.44] And their name.
[2560.94 → 2562.06] Yeah, I knew that.
[2562.30 → 2564.52] And what their spending habits are.
[2564.96 → 2568.36] And what their online browsing activity is, very likely.
[2568.66 → 2568.86] Yeah.
[2569.94 → 2570.74] That's all I knew.
[2570.76 → 2572.14] What various accounts they have.
[2572.92 → 2573.68] That's all I knew.
[2574.26 → 2577.66] What are all those sites like somethingmingle.com?
[2577.76 → 2579.14] They use that.
[2579.22 → 2579.84] We know that.
[2580.84 → 2581.98] Give me a bit of a hint.
[2582.16 → 2582.90] Farmers only?
[2583.42 → 2583.86] Yeah.
[2584.80 → 2585.74] Very good.
[2587.64 → 2590.62] Magic the Gathering gamers mingle.
[2591.86 → 2593.38] Isn't that like a self-help group?
[2595.40 → 2598.84] Are you tired of your partner leaving you because you spent too much money on magic cards?
[2598.96 → 2599.44] Camping rent!
[2599.46 → 2600.14] What if you both did?
[2602.18 → 2603.96] Generally speaking, I think.
[2603.96 → 2604.48] Tricks for draw.
[2605.74 → 2609.10] I think what we would prefer.
[2609.10 → 2612.46] And I'm going to try and speak on behalf of Luke as well.
[2612.54 → 2614.48] So we can kind of summarize this and wrap it up.
[2614.88 → 2624.14] I think what we would prefer is that credit organizations and banking organizations get out of the way.
[2624.58 → 2625.44] Big time.
[2625.44 → 2633.28] And do their job, which is to be a facilitator and not do things other than that.
[2633.28 → 2636.76] Your job should be to store and move.
[2636.76 → 2636.86] Move.
[2637.58 → 2641.54] And in some ways, with my consent, manipulate the money that I have.
[2641.54 → 2647.52] And when I choose to deposit, or I choose to withdraw, you should get out of the way.
[2647.70 → 2657.40] Unless those funds are the proceeds of criminal activity, human trafficking, illicit substances, trafficking.
[2657.40 → 2657.84] Cool.
[2660.84 → 2665.00] So if you're looking for anything to do, I'm not saying to do this.
[2665.00 → 2680.04] But I will objectively pass along that the community has mounted petitions and campaigns calling for people to overwhelm Visa and MasterCard's support with constant complaints about their policies.
[2681.76 → 2682.48] Interesting.
[2682.48 → 2686.50] I wouldn't encourage anybody to do that.
[2687.52 → 2687.76] Yeah.
[2687.94 → 2695.04] But if you wanted to, to stay away from learning how to do those things, there are many resources online.
[2695.46 → 2695.82] All right.
[2696.18 → 2696.66] Cool.
[2697.78 → 2699.24] So be careful with your internet usage.
[2699.28 → 2700.26] Oh, this is rumour mill.
[2700.72 → 2712.20] Anna V, an NSFW Tuber and outspoken poster regarding the MasterCard ban, claims a source reached out to them claiming that MasterCard, a major esports sponsor, has requested that Riot,
[2712.48 → 2719.04] and esports content creators working with Riot Games keep an eye out for negative sentiment towards MasterCard.
[2719.98 → 2727.02] I mean, do you really need anyone to keep an eye out for that?
[2728.02 → 2729.40] Like, it's there.
[2730.54 → 2731.70] Yeah, we all hate this.
[2733.84 → 2734.70] You're welcome.
[2736.04 → 2737.06] Yeah, I don't know.
[2737.94 → 2738.90] All right, cool.
[2738.90 → 2745.28] I don't think I've ever heard anyone ever say a positive thing about any of the like, credit backbone companies.
[2745.48 → 2747.32] They clearly just, like, prey on people.
[2749.42 → 2750.04] I don't know.
[2750.20 → 2753.88] I think their fight is to try to take it from negative to neutral, if anything.
[2754.06 → 2755.66] I don't think they're ever expecting to get to positive.
[2756.46 → 2760.26] I don't think you can be in that industry and expect people to get to positive with you.
[2760.50 → 2761.30] I don't think so.
[2761.40 → 2761.60] Personally.
[2762.40 → 2763.76] I mean, hmm.
[2765.68 → 2767.02] I've definitely...
[2767.02 → 2769.96] I hear people speak positively about individual cards.
[2770.60 → 2771.38] Yeah, that's a thing.
[2771.44 → 2772.38] This is a good card.
[2772.62 → 2777.22] Amex seems to have a pretty strong brand these days.
[2777.96 → 2780.76] I've personally never been able to figure that out.
[2780.78 → 2780.88] Oh, right.
[2780.88 → 2781.92] They are a backbone thing.
[2782.04 → 2782.24] Really?
[2782.34 → 2782.46] Why?
[2783.46 → 2784.42] Well, okay.
[2784.50 → 2787.28] Because I don't value the perks that they offer.
[2787.48 → 2787.88] Got it.
[2788.04 → 2788.80] I don't even know what they are.
[2788.94 → 2789.96] I don't even know what they are.
[2791.40 → 2791.84] Okay.
[2792.84 → 2797.00] I guess we're going to do the thing where I sort of real talk.
[2797.46 → 2799.88] I could afford, you know.
[2800.84 → 2802.70] What are the Amex perks, though?
[2802.74 → 2803.48] I don't have a...
[2803.48 → 2805.06] I don't know what perks you're talking about.
[2806.34 → 2808.14] Okay, like, you can...
[2808.14 → 2809.70] This is not an Amex commercial.
[2810.18 → 2811.06] Yeah, not even a little.
[2811.06 → 2811.14] Cool.
[2812.02 → 2814.42] But, like, I hear people speak positively about them as well.
[2814.52 → 2816.78] Like, I could afford the annual fee.
[2816.88 → 2817.80] Wouldn't everyone have them?
[2818.28 → 2818.52] Sorry?
[2818.84 → 2820.00] If they're that good, wouldn't everyone?
[2820.18 → 2821.08] And they're so uncommon.
[2821.28 → 2823.22] No, no, because they have really high fees.
[2823.68 → 2826.38] So I could afford the fee of a Centurion.
[2827.10 → 2829.86] I think it's invite only, so I couldn't necessarily even get one.
[2829.92 → 2831.10] But it's just the black card.
[2831.38 → 2831.66] Okay.
[2831.84 → 2834.08] Like the Amex black card.
[2834.22 → 2834.54] Cool.
[2835.12 → 2839.28] But the perks that it offers are not things that I really value.
[2839.28 → 2845.54] Like, you can, like, at certain festivals, they'll have, like, a tent where you can go.
[2845.82 → 2846.18] Okay.
[2846.52 → 2847.12] And yet...
[2847.12 → 2848.86] That's not for us.
[2851.86 → 2853.58] We're not going to benefit from this.
[2853.58 → 2858.18] The look on your face, dude.
[2864.62 → 2864.98] Okay.
[2865.08 → 2871.70] Anyway, so you can get access to things like travel rewards, airport lounges.
[2871.70 → 2878.82] Personally, I get anxiety when I sit in an airport lounge because I'm somewhere not at my gate.
[2878.92 → 2879.86] You feel like you're going to miss it, yeah.
[2879.86 → 2881.10] And I feel like I'm going to miss my flight.
[2881.20 → 2883.16] So that has zero value to me whatsoever.
[2883.50 → 2888.84] Coming back from DEFCON, it was close because we were sitting in an airport lounge.
[2888.84 → 2897.38] And I, like, happened to check the time and was like, oh, we need to be there in, like, eight minutes until boarding ends.
[2898.02 → 2900.96] And while we were running there, they called our names over the thing.
[2901.16 → 2913.42] According to an AI overview, so take this for what it is, the Centurion card also offers automatic elite status with various hotel and car rental programs.
[2913.42 → 2924.84] I have never, I'll be, again, I could probably, like, get elite with a hotel chain or something.
[2925.02 → 2929.82] But I stay in hotels based on how close they are to whatever it is that I'm doing.
[2930.08 → 2933.12] Not based on that they have a super nice, cool brand.
[2933.22 → 2934.64] I don't care about that at all.
[2934.70 → 2938.58] I have literally zero loyalty to any hotel brand.
[2938.70 → 2941.12] You can take that to the bank.
[2941.12 → 2944.10] So I don't care about that.
[2944.22 → 2946.94] But maybe elite status is really cool.
[2947.94 → 2952.52] Okay, rest assured says my boss has an Amex Black, and he gets free car rentals somehow.
[2952.76 → 2954.06] But see, that's the thing.
[2954.32 → 2956.52] He doesn't get free car rentals.
[2957.30 → 2960.86] Amex Centurion price.
[2960.86 → 2971.62] So the cost of it is a one-time initiation fee of $10,000 and a $5,000 annual fee.
[2972.06 → 2972.42] Ooh!
[2972.82 → 2974.84] So he doesn't get free s***.
[2974.98 → 2976.40] He doesn't get free anything.
[2976.58 → 2978.50] He gets that he already paid for it.
[2978.54 → 2980.02] Is your first year $15,000?
[2980.46 → 2982.64] Or is the $5,000 included in the $10,000?
[2982.64 → 2986.74] It is $15,000 for the first year.
[2986.84 → 2987.14] Ooh!
[2988.10 → 2992.34] Scrappy DP says, but if you spend more than $10,000 in rentals, hear me out.
[2995.54 → 2996.06] Yeah.
[2996.36 → 3000.02] Now to be clear, Amex has lower fee cards.
[3000.32 → 3000.58] Yeah.
[3000.84 → 3001.54] Way lower.
[3001.76 → 3005.30] I think their cobalt or something is like $100.
[3005.30 → 3009.22] I'm specifically talking about like the black card.
[3009.32 → 3009.90] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3009.92 → 3010.64] The fancy one.
[3010.70 → 3017.08] That has like sort of this urban legend around it that it has an unlimited credit limit on
[3017.08 → 3019.18] it and stuff like that, which is not true at all.
[3019.32 → 3020.56] They have no annual fee cards.
[3021.30 → 3021.48] Yeah.
[3021.60 → 3022.04] There you go.
[3022.14 → 3022.98] So whatever.
[3023.20 → 3024.02] So I don't know.
[3024.08 → 3029.48] I just, I find, I do find it a little confusing, but it's been kind of showing up in my feed lately
[3029.48 → 3036.32] that like, you know, Amex is really popular, is like really growing with like younger generation
[3036.32 → 3037.02] spenders.
[3037.02 → 3038.90] Debt is really growing with younger generations.
[3038.90 → 3039.14] Okay.
[3039.20 → 3040.88] No, but like their share, their market share.
[3041.08 → 3041.46] Mm-hmm.
[3041.46 → 3042.06] Mm-hmm.
[3042.22 → 3042.66] Yeah.
[3042.66 → 3044.94] The younger generation's market share of debt is really growing.
[3045.04 → 3045.22] I know.
[3045.28 → 3045.52] I'm kidding.
[3045.68 → 3045.86] I'm kidding.
[3046.38 → 3046.76] Yes.
[3046.92 → 3047.30] Yes.
[3047.32 → 3047.70] Okay.
[3047.78 → 3048.06] Yes.
[3048.48 → 3053.34] Dude, the young ins on the Klarna's is like a huge problem.
[3053.50 → 3055.68] We've talked about that on the show before, but it's like just getting worse.
[3057.58 → 3058.48] Oh no.
[3060.48 → 3060.88] Cool.
[3064.24 → 3066.82] Apparently someone bought a house with that card.
[3068.16 → 3072.44] Or a Don man says, I had a friend with one of those cards, and he could flash that card
[3072.44 → 3075.98] at restaurants that were months out for reservations, and we would get a table.
[3076.44 → 3077.84] He bought a house on that card.
[3078.28 → 3083.12] So see, this is the kind of thing that like if, if somebody flashed me that card when I was
[3083.12 → 3087.94] at like a an LTT store pop-up, I probably wouldn't even recognize it.
[3087.94 → 3088.18] Yeah.
[3088.32 → 3090.26] Like my credit card is black in colour.
[3090.62 → 3090.84] Yeah.
[3091.76 → 3095.58] I wouldn't know like if you have the right black coloured card or not.
[3095.58 → 3095.66] Yeah.
[3095.66 → 3096.10] So is mine.
[3096.16 → 3098.30] I've had the same one since the basement suite.
[3098.40 → 3101.54] So you can kind of like make some assumptions.
[3101.90 → 3102.44] Mine's black.
[3102.56 → 3103.34] It goes to Costco.
[3103.54 → 3104.64] It's my Costco card.
[3104.64 → 3104.96] Yeah.
[3105.08 → 3106.96] Do you have an executive member of Costco card?
[3106.96 → 3107.06] I do.
[3107.40 → 3108.80] I'm an executive member.
[3108.98 → 3109.48] Very nice.
[3109.58 → 3109.78] Very nice.
[3109.78 → 3110.94] I think it started around there.
[3111.06 → 3111.52] I'm not even kidding.
[3112.18 → 3112.58] Executive.
[3112.58 → 3113.58] Yeah.
[3113.58 → 3117.76] So like I, this is clearly a world that I don't really understand.
[3118.08 → 3121.78] It's also a world that is very limited in Canada compared to the States.
[3121.88 → 3123.46] But it's also apparently a world.
[3123.58 → 3124.10] It's a thing.
[3124.16 → 3124.50] It is.
[3124.60 → 3126.46] It's, it's, it's evidently a thing.
[3130.46 → 3133.50] Hobbs Cutoff says it's also not a credit card.
[3133.50 → 3137.20] As with most MX cards, it is a charge card.
[3137.20 → 3137.60] Okay.
[3137.80 → 3138.44] All right.
[3138.44 → 3140.10] It's time for me to learn.
[3140.24 → 3143.34] It's time for me to learn live on the WAN show.
[3144.02 → 3147.70] Credit card versus charge card comparison.
[3148.52 → 3148.86] Okay.
[3148.88 → 3150.06] There's no AI overview.
[3150.34 → 3152.24] So we're going straight to the horse.
[3152.40 → 3152.52] Yeah.
[3152.52 → 3153.04] That's rough.
[3153.16 → 3154.32] Here's the horse's mouth.
[3154.88 → 3156.72] Credit card versus charge card.
[3157.80 → 3162.92] However, there's a difference knowing about credit card lets you pay for purchases without
[3162.92 → 3163.46] cash.
[3163.46 → 3167.86] They offer a line of credit or loan that allows you to make purchases and pay back the amount
[3167.86 → 3168.20] later.
[3168.48 → 3171.98] If you fail to pay the balance due in full, you are charged an interest on the amount owed.
[3172.08 → 3172.20] Okay.
[3172.22 → 3175.24] That was my understanding of, I thought charge card just meant credit card.
[3175.32 → 3176.38] So here's a charge card.
[3177.26 → 3179.16] A charge card works like a credit card.
[3179.20 → 3179.76] Okay, great.
[3179.82 → 3180.26] Case closed.
[3180.64 → 3180.78] No.
[3180.86 → 3180.98] Okay.
[3180.98 → 3181.88] We'll actually finish it.
[3182.14 → 3188.20] But without offering the option of making a partial payment, you are required to pay your
[3188.20 → 3191.12] charge card bill in full by the due date.
[3191.12 → 3197.24] They offer no preset spending limit, meaning that your charges are approved based on your
[3197.24 → 3199.40] spending pattern, financials, credit record, and your account history.
[3199.92 → 3202.46] But that's how they determine your credit limit.
[3205.56 → 3208.94] This sounds like a distinction without a difference, folks.
[3209.06 → 3213.54] Except you have to pay the full amount, which wouldn't that be bad for them?
[3213.54 → 3218.24] No, because they still get their processing fee.
[3219.64 → 3222.64] Remember, they win whether you're in debt with them or not.
[3222.72 → 3223.64] They're no interest.
[3224.62 → 3225.06] Effectively.
[3225.84 → 3226.54] But I guess...
[3227.18 → 3228.58] Unless you fully fail to pay the full amount.
[3228.58 → 3231.84] Unless you fail to pay, then I'm sure they'd be happy to charge you fees and interest for
[3231.84 → 3232.00] it.
[3232.90 → 3234.84] Which means it's still a credit card?
[3234.84 → 3242.10] Like I said, it appears to be a distinction without a real difference.
[3245.12 → 3246.36] So that's neat.
[3246.88 → 3249.48] Doesn't everyone have to get their card replaced every few years?
[3250.04 → 3250.34] Yeah.
[3250.44 → 3251.94] How could you have the same card for that long?
[3251.98 → 3253.98] Because they just shipped me a new one of the same card.
[3254.14 → 3254.36] Yeah.
[3254.76 → 3255.86] But with different numbers.
[3256.16 → 3256.46] Yeah.
[3256.86 → 3257.94] But it's the same account.
[3258.20 → 3258.36] Yeah.
[3258.36 → 3258.70] Don't worry.
[3258.76 → 3259.08] It's okay.
[3259.42 → 3259.62] Yeah.
[3259.62 → 3261.02] Okay.
[3261.12 → 3266.04] If you don't pay in full, they turn the card off and charge fees and interest and may cancel
[3266.04 → 3266.58] your card.
[3266.76 → 3273.32] So the charge card is basically to flex that you are not actually in debt.
[3275.38 → 3276.32] Through the card.
[3277.22 → 3277.50] Sure.
[3280.24 → 3281.00] Who cares?
[3281.34 → 3281.58] Yeah.
[3282.10 → 3283.16] Not through this card.
[3284.84 → 3287.14] I might have 12 more in my wallet.
[3288.68 → 3289.16] Okay.
[3289.62 → 3290.26] All right.
[3290.26 → 3290.66] But invite only.
[3290.76 → 3294.32] Lots of things that are invite only are invite only up until the point where you have enough
[3294.32 → 3294.64] money.
[3294.72 → 3296.36] And Centurion's not invite only anymore.
[3296.46 → 3298.20] You can apply these days.
[3298.32 → 3300.54] Whereas it used to be legitimately invite only.
[3300.62 → 3305.20] And apparently there was some kind of black magic around looking at your spending patterns.
[3305.40 → 3308.06] Not just how much money you spend, but like what you spend it on.
[3308.42 → 3313.54] So like I never would have gotten an invitation because you have to like buy fine dining and
[3313.54 → 3319.60] private travel and like concierge services and like all kinds of stay at fancy hotels.
[3319.60 → 3320.42] And stuff like that.
[3320.46 → 3323.60] Like they only wanted to attract a certain sort of customer.
[3326.64 → 3330.48] P-Ball says, so a charge card is like a fancy debit card that gets paid at the end of the
[3330.48 → 3330.66] month.
[3331.06 → 3331.40] Yeah.
[3331.40 → 3334.82] It's basically like a debit card with overdraft.
[3336.16 → 3336.60] Yeah.
[3338.72 → 3340.32] That you have to pay every month.
[3340.82 → 3342.02] So that's something.
[3342.76 → 3343.16] Um.
[3343.82 → 3344.30] All right.
[3344.84 → 3346.48] What are we supposed to be doing right now?
[3346.48 → 3348.30] Now you're going to do CW and S.
[3348.52 → 3349.78] And merch messages.
[3350.42 → 3351.30] Oh, neat.
[3351.44 → 3351.76] Okay.
[3351.84 → 3352.54] Let's do that.
[3352.62 → 3353.38] How far off are we, Dan?
[3353.52 → 3354.60] 25 seconds.
[3355.14 → 3355.32] Oh.
[3357.08 → 3357.94] No way.
[3359.26 → 3360.40] Are you a wizard?
[3360.94 → 3361.80] What happened here?
[3361.80 → 3363.66] I changed the WAN show timing.
[3364.28 → 3364.98] That's what I'm saying.
[3365.06 → 3365.28] Wait.
[3365.48 → 3366.02] So wait.
[3366.38 → 3367.60] We didn't get better.
[3367.98 → 3370.76] You just got more accurate at predicting our puckery.
[3371.44 → 3372.16] I think so.
[3372.28 → 3372.58] A little.
[3372.68 → 3373.26] A little bit.
[3373.56 → 3373.80] Oh.
[3374.10 → 3375.44] Well, that's less impressive then.
[3376.38 → 3376.72] No, I.
[3376.82 → 3378.28] That's impressive of Dan.
[3378.36 → 3379.14] Oh, yeah.
[3379.34 → 3379.48] Yeah.
[3379.58 → 3379.88] Oh, okay.
[3379.96 → 3383.14] I thought we were impressed with ourselves for staying on schedule.
[3383.14 → 3384.44] Well, the thing is that I could have got it wrong.
[3384.56 → 3386.24] And you're the one who's been driving this.
[3386.30 → 3387.24] And it's been perfect.
[3387.46 → 3387.64] So.
[3388.02 → 3388.38] Wow.
[3388.50 → 3389.46] Everybody wins.
[3389.94 → 3390.78] 55 minutes.
[3390.92 → 3391.78] We're at 56 now.
[3391.80 → 3392.44] Way to go, Dan.
[3392.70 → 3392.86] Good.
[3393.12 → 3393.52] Yay.
[3394.16 → 3395.16] Good job, team.
[3397.04 → 3399.04] Now explain what a merch message is.
[3399.10 → 3399.70] All right.
[3399.70 → 3403.88] If you want to interact with the show, the way to do it is with a merch message.
[3404.24 → 3406.74] We don't do like Twitch bits or Super Chats or anything like that.
[3406.74 → 3413.20] Because we think when you throw money at your screen, you should get spectacular merch in return.
[3413.70 → 3417.44] And boy, do we ever have a boozy for you this week.
[3417.62 → 3426.50] All you got to do to send a merch message is go to LTTstore.com and be greeted by the Scribe Driver Mechanical Pencil.
[3427.34 → 3428.62] That's right, my friends.
[3428.62 → 3433.58] We now, to be unboxed by the one and only, Luc Cafetière.
[3433.96 → 3435.40] He's not going to screw it up this time.
[3435.82 → 3442.48] We now have a mechanical pencil that is made out of harvested shafts.
[3442.48 → 3443.04] That's right.
[3443.04 → 3451.58] When you accidentally buy 100,000 screwdriver shafts from a supplier that doesn't meet your quality standards for screwdrivers,
[3451.74 → 3458.42] but you really want to use those three tons of metal for something, you make pens.
[3458.42 → 3460.10] Or, in this case, pencils.
[3460.84 → 3466.56] The Scribe Driver Pencil is a precision machined mechanical pencil for an elevated everyday carry.
[3466.92 → 3473.44] It's got a premium finish built to the same standards as our tools and allows you to write all day long.
[3473.76 → 3481.10] The knurled grip section offers a secure, comfortable hold for control and consistency whether you're writing notes or sketching up your next big project.
[3481.10 → 3484.86] And they're refillable, naturally, with 0.5mm lead.
[3485.28 → 3496.16] The Schmidt DSM 2007 Fine Mining Pencil System delivers clean, consistent lines for writing, sketching, or making measurements, and it's preloaded with 0.5mm lead.
[3496.16 → 3502.32] And we could do this entirely like that, or we could just make life easier and show it like this.
[3503.18 → 3504.08] Good effort, Luke.
[3504.22 → 3504.66] Solid.
[3504.94 → 3505.30] I tried.
[3505.64 → 3509.82] So it still has kind of a bolt-action-y kind of thing going on.
[3509.92 → 3510.22] Yes.
[3510.32 → 3511.54] You can operate it from the side.
[3511.74 → 3516.94] Yeah, but that was only to keep it consistent with the ID of the pen.
[3517.06 → 3517.40] Yes.
[3517.82 → 3519.22] Or you can operate it from the top.
[3519.38 → 3521.20] Yeah, because you can just click the top.
[3521.32 → 3521.48] Yeah.
[3521.54 → 3524.96] Because, obviously, you would want to click the top because it's a mechanical pencil.
[3525.22 → 3525.44] Sure.
[3525.44 → 3527.52] But we didn't want it to look so different.
[3528.12 → 3529.00] Also, this is cute.
[3529.32 → 3530.10] Yeah, I like that.
[3530.10 → 3536.46] You can see the size of the I don't know, do they still call them pencil lead, even though they're like graphite or whatever?
[3537.60 → 3538.00] Probably.
[3538.32 → 3538.56] Sure.
[3540.10 → 3541.34] There it is, folks.
[3542.00 → 3542.64] Look at it.
[3542.72 → 3543.52] Isn't it beautiful?
[3544.88 → 3545.32] Ooh.
[3545.38 → 3545.78] Ooh.
[3548.36 → 3549.00] Oh, nice.
[3549.04 → 3549.70] You got both there?
[3550.00 → 3550.24] Yep.
[3550.54 → 3551.12] Heck yeah.
[3551.26 → 3554.02] So we have it in brass or in silver.
[3554.02 → 3556.48] I like the idea of having one of each colour.
[3556.68 → 3559.42] Because you can differentiate, but that makes it even easier.
[3560.80 → 3561.28] Oh.
[3561.82 → 3563.04] Also introducing...
[3564.92 → 3567.00] Our Series 5 pins!
[3567.00 → 3580.50] We have six fun new designs by Sarah and team, including blue screen, glitter Lamb, right to repair, circuit heart, and what we know is going to be Luke's favourite.
[3580.74 → 3581.56] That's right.
[3582.56 → 3583.12] Budgies!
[3583.12 → 3584.66] They already are.
[3584.74 → 3585.66] They're so awesome.
[3586.06 → 3587.38] So that's Scoop and Wally.
[3587.50 → 3592.36] Scoop is the it's kind of a white and blue, and then Wally's the green and yellow.
[3592.70 → 3594.82] So one of them is holding an LTT CPU.
[3595.08 → 3597.96] The other is holding a float plane CPU.
[3597.96 → 3601.96] This is obviously styled after like a Pantone chip.
[3602.58 → 3603.44] Not infringing, though.
[3603.54 → 3604.50] Not infringing, I'm sure.
[3604.54 → 3605.14] No, of course not.
[3605.48 → 3608.02] And then this one has a little bit of like glitter.
[3608.40 → 3611.96] So it's my, it's my old, very stylish vehicle.
[3612.74 → 3614.82] And then, of course, we have the CPU heart.
[3615.28 → 3615.88] And right to repair.
[3617.20 → 3617.82] Oh, yep.
[3618.16 → 3618.40] Yep.
[3619.44 → 3621.14] Gorgeous pins, as always.
[3621.24 → 3625.82] And hey, don't forget to pick up a WAN cork board so that you can put all of your new pins on it.
[3625.82 → 3627.48] Very cool.
[3627.62 → 3629.14] I'm stoked about the birds.
[3629.30 → 3629.98] That's awesome.
[3630.30 → 3630.70] All right.
[3630.92 → 3633.50] Now, Dan, what am I supposed to do now?
[3635.48 → 3636.58] Do a merch message.
[3636.68 → 3638.44] I think now we do merch messages.
[3638.66 → 3638.90] Okay.
[3639.04 → 3640.84] And then we do more topics.
[3641.06 → 3641.70] That's how it works.
[3641.76 → 3642.08] Okay.
[3642.66 → 3643.02] Okay.
[3643.14 → 3644.36] We've got our merch messages.
[3644.62 → 3644.96] Okay.
[3646.34 → 3647.24] Let's see.
[3647.24 → 3649.84] Hey, DLL, super excited for Whale Land.
[3650.02 → 3652.16] I was able to get a whale VIP spot.
[3652.58 → 3655.70] Anything you're excited for during the event and any recommendations?
[3656.12 → 3658.22] To do well in the Surrey, BC area.
[3658.36 → 3658.58] Yeah.
[3658.64 → 3660.22] I'm super excited to it.
[3660.30 → 3661.30] Hopefully goes okay.
[3661.50 → 3663.18] Are there any changes?
[3663.84 → 3664.24] Changes?
[3664.34 → 3665.08] Compared to last time.
[3665.40 → 3666.16] Uh, yes.
[3666.16 → 3667.90] I know, like, nothing about it this time.
[3668.10 → 3670.86] You said you were going to force people to not play games or something different.
[3670.86 → 3671.08] Yeah.
[3671.32 → 3672.50] Force people to not play games?
[3672.50 → 3674.56] You were planning a bunch of stuff.
[3674.66 → 3675.76] Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[3675.76 → 3676.00] And things.
[3676.14 → 3677.44] That's a long-term plan.
[3677.94 → 3678.40] And things.
[3678.40 → 3684.72] The long-term plan is to convert Whale Land from, like, a pure BYOC to more of, like,
[3684.72 → 3686.20] an experience.
[3686.52 → 3686.76] Yeah.
[3686.76 → 3688.84] So this is the same as the last one.
[3688.86 → 3690.48] This will be basically a BYOC.
[3690.48 → 3696.76] However, hopefully, if everything goes according to plan with what Elijah's working on, we will
[3696.76 → 3702.12] actually have a really cool project that people will be able to use in person that will be
[3702.12 → 3710.30] sort of precursor to some of the upcoming more experience-driven Whale Land-ness.
[3710.30 → 3720.74] So he's working on, um, I believe it's a 8v8, completely, like, packable, rack-mountable,
[3720.74 → 3724.22] like, versus gaming setup.
[3724.40 → 3724.66] Nice.
[3724.66 → 3730.16] That's pretty much just going to be preloaded with a small handful of games allowing people
[3730.16 → 3736.34] to kind of come in, sit down, play, like, right across the monitor from each other,
[3736.44 → 3744.00] like, literally head-to-head, and, um, not have to worry about, you know, the quality of
[3744.00 → 3748.40] the if, if someone else's peripherals were a little better, or, you know, their PC was
[3748.40 → 3752.46] a little better, and more of, like, a, like, an almost competitive, like, a more esports
[3752.46 → 3753.34] style.
[3753.34 → 3758.40] Um, it's going to be, from what I've seen of the plan, a super cool setup.
[3758.40 → 3767.50] So each of the eight systems is going to be, I want to say it was going to average about
[3767.50 → 3773.66] two rack units per, three rack units per two systems or something like that.
[3773.74 → 3777.96] Like, it's, it's, like, they're going to be really compact, and basically you'll just
[3777.96 → 3783.78] have these, like, like, kind of on wheels, like, rollable rack units at, uh, at the ends
[3783.78 → 3788.02] of the tables, and then all of the or probably the middle, and then they'll come out so that
[3788.02 → 3792.08] we can keep the cable shorter, and then it'll do four and four on either side of them, and
[3792.08 → 3793.50] they'll just sit there and run the whole thing.
[3793.50 → 3795.58] It's going to be a test that we're doing, I guess, of sorts.
[3795.86 → 3803.24] Yeah, because everything, everything to create these experiences has to be, like, cartable
[3803.24 → 3805.58] across the parking lot, effectively.
[3806.06 → 3809.70] Like, we've got to be, or, like, into the back of a truck, and then just, like, roll out
[3809.70 → 3810.24] and deploy.
[3810.46 → 3814.82] Because otherwise we have, we're only in there for, like, a weekend at a time, right?
[3814.82 → 3815.72] For Whalen events.
[3815.88 → 3821.96] So if it can't be set up in a few hours, effectively we can't do it.
[3822.78 → 3825.48] Uh, so this is going to be kind of a kind of, a test.
[3825.62 → 3831.66] So that one theoretically should be done in time for us to have there.
[3831.78 → 3835.22] And then there are a couple of things that I'm going to want to have there, regardless
[3835.22 → 3836.76] of whether it's for a video or not.
[3836.78 → 3839.04] Like, I want to have a 10-player tape-to-tape set up.
[3839.62 → 3843.48] I don't think we'll necessarily have any of the VR stuff ready for this one, but in the
[3843.48 → 3846.92] future I'd like to do Bridge Crew and kind of cool stuff like that.
[3847.08 → 3847.32] Yeah, yeah.
[3847.32 → 3848.18] But mostly...
[3848.18 → 3848.88] Bridge Crew would be sick.
[3848.94 → 3850.96] This one's just going to be a BYOC.
[3851.14 → 3851.68] Sure, yeah.
[3854.04 → 3856.40] I ran into a problem this time.
[3857.04 → 3858.64] Oh, you didn't get tickets.
[3860.32 → 3861.76] We will have a small staff.
[3861.98 → 3863.00] Nobody told me.
[3863.12 → 3865.16] We've done it the same way every time.
[3865.16 → 3869.30] And then no one said anything, and it's dramatically different now.
[3869.84 → 3873.28] So, like, a ton of people that have come every time are just like,
[3873.48 → 3873.96] Oops!
[3874.84 → 3875.96] Would have bought one, didn't know.
[3877.84 → 3878.70] Lots of people.
[3878.82 → 3881.54] I worked with Chase to get one of them fixed because they booked flights.
[3884.66 → 3886.96] And I was like, um...
[3886.96 → 3888.24] Sorry, what was different?
[3888.96 → 3891.54] There's always been, like, a huge reserve for staff.
[3892.32 → 3893.88] Oh, well, we don't have that many seats?
[3894.18 → 3895.66] Yeah, but no one said anything.
[3895.78 → 3897.34] Oh, yeah, no, we don't have that many seats.
[3897.46 → 3901.38] So, like, the boys, like, almost none of them.
[3901.82 → 3902.14] Yeah.
[3902.58 → 3905.74] Because, like, usually I tell them closer to the event and whatever else.
[3905.86 → 3907.06] Like, I just...
[3907.06 → 3914.44] The reason why I even know is that one of them saw it and, like, didn't want to free boat again.
[3914.86 → 3916.78] So, went to go buy a ticket themselves.
[3917.30 → 3919.50] And then was like, um, they're all gone.
[3919.64 → 3920.32] Can I go?
[3920.44 → 3921.06] And I was like...
[3921.06 → 3927.78] Yeah, they sold out in, like, two days.
[3927.94 → 3929.14] Yeah, they sold out really fast.
[3929.24 → 3930.32] I mean, like...
[3930.32 → 3932.96] Because they messaged me, I think, because we announced it on WAN Show.
[3933.00 → 3934.62] And I think they messaged me on, like, Monday or Tuesday.
[3935.72 → 3936.36] And they were just gone.
[3936.48 → 3937.00] I was like, wow.
[3937.52 → 3937.84] Yeah.
[3939.34 → 3940.84] That makes sense.
[3941.60 → 3944.08] Sparky Citizen said, nobody's telling you many things these days.
[3944.16 → 3947.62] I'm like, dude, that's been true for a long time.
[3947.62 → 3948.62] Yeah, I mean, we have a lot going on.
[3948.64 → 3949.50] It's a huge company.
[3949.50 → 3950.50] There are so many things happening.
[3950.80 → 3954.60] I gave a tour to some of Emma's cousins last night.
[3955.40 → 3959.48] And over and over and over, it's like, wow, you guys do a lot of stuff.
[3962.56 → 3966.04] I was like, yeah, we got a lot of things happening.
[3966.78 → 3967.30] There's no...
[3967.30 → 3970.94] Like, it would be a full-time job just to be informed about what's happening.
[3970.94 → 3972.18] I mean, that is a full-time job.
[3972.44 → 3973.62] His name is Baron Tom.
[3973.70 → 3974.28] Yeah, I guess.
[3974.38 → 3975.12] Yeah, fair enough.
[3975.56 → 3978.42] And even that's, like, that's got to be tough to keep up with.
[3978.42 → 3979.30] There are so many things.
[3979.30 → 3980.34] Yeah, I get it.
[3981.00 → 3983.06] So, man, I'm sorry to hear that.
[3983.26 → 3990.08] The good news is, as I said on Reddit, when someone asked, they were, like, desperate to get a ticket.
[3990.32 → 3994.78] And they were, like, going to be at their job, which requires them to, like, leave their phone and everything.
[3994.96 → 3996.72] Like, they work in, like, a high-security facility.
[3997.56 → 4000.24] So, they were, like, what if I don't get one?
[4001.12 → 4002.38] I'll say what I said to them.
[4002.52 → 4005.78] And that's, the first one's probably going to be relatively Jacky.
[4006.10 → 4007.06] And there's going to be more.
[4007.78 → 4008.64] And there will be more.
[4008.64 → 4011.26] Have we kind of locked down a plan of, like, how often we want to do it?
[4011.26 → 4015.50] We have a temporary use permit that allows us to run them four times a year.
[4015.76 → 4016.78] Okay, once a quarter, yeah.
[4016.84 → 4020.10] And that's, right now, probably.
[4020.50 → 4021.06] Roughly the idea.
[4021.18 → 4021.68] The idea.
[4021.78 → 4028.56] And once it's at once a quarter, the like, voraciousness of getting tickets is probably going to chill out a little bit.
[4028.80 → 4029.32] Or not.
[4029.66 → 4031.06] Or it'll go higher.
[4031.06 → 4033.60] Or, I suspect it'll go higher with some people.
[4034.74 → 4037.54] But the like, FOMO of ever doing it.
[4038.12 → 4038.52] Yeah.
[4038.60 → 4039.22] Will go down.
[4039.58 → 4040.24] I hope so.
[4040.28 → 4041.20] Because there's always next quarter.
[4041.66 → 4053.28] But because we are limited to the facility that we're in, it's not like we can adapt and, you know, do a 350-seat LAN or a 500-seat LAN.
[4053.28 → 4058.00] The thing is the new plan could accommodate higher numbers easier.
[4058.18 → 4060.48] Because we could do two-day passes or one-day passes.
[4060.48 → 4063.10] Well, and you don't, you wouldn't necessarily have to bring your own computer.
[4064.40 → 4067.30] It's still, we would still have occupancy limits.
[4067.58 → 4069.42] What's the occupancy on that one side?
[4070.62 → 4074.18] We would be applying for it temporarily, and it would be about 250.
[4074.54 → 4076.16] We can't really go much higher than that.
[4076.18 → 4077.44] We have, like, that many seats.
[4078.42 → 4078.58] Yeah.
[4078.78 → 4078.96] Yeah.
[4079.14 → 4079.92] So it wouldn't really make sense.
[4079.92 → 4081.22] I mean, people are at a BYOC.
[4081.48 → 4083.44] Like, people are, like, pretty packed in.
[4084.08 → 4084.68] Yeah, that's fair.
[4084.86 → 4090.30] And so we're not going to be able to get it a lot really denser by having couches.
[4090.48 → 4092.04] That people sit around and play games.
[4092.28 → 4096.32] Like, it's, I don't think it's really going to help that much, to be honest with you.
[4097.22 → 4098.10] I'm sorry.
[4098.62 → 4105.30] No, it's, I just, the it's been the exact same way for, like, whatever, like five years or whatever.
[4105.38 → 4108.06] So now it's just like, okay, now we just have to ticket snipe.
[4108.32 → 4109.20] This is hilarious.
[4109.20 → 4110.26] Packs or whatever, which is fine.
[4110.50 → 4111.44] This is hilarious.
[4111.70 → 4114.28] I've already said the first one's probably going to be kind of Jacky.
[4114.54 → 4116.52] And Tim's going, can I get an annual pass?
[4117.36 → 4118.06] We'll play chat.
[4122.92 → 4123.56] Oh, boy.
[4124.08 → 4124.40] Yeah.
[4124.50 → 4125.74] I'm just going to have to.
[4128.20 → 4128.96] What now?
[4129.22 → 4129.48] Nothing.
[4129.58 → 4130.30] Don't worry about it.
[4130.60 → 4131.86] No, you have to tell us.
[4131.86 → 4133.12] No, we'll just have tickets in the future.
[4133.20 → 4133.62] That's all I'm saying.
[4134.50 → 4135.72] We'll just all get tickets in the future.
[4135.78 → 4136.16] It'll be fine.
[4138.62 → 4139.72] It'll be totally fine.
[4140.78 → 4142.52] We get tickets for packs every single time.
[4142.62 → 4144.28] We never missed it once for reasons.
[4144.42 → 4145.80] And we'll do that for here as well.
[4146.18 → 4147.96] Chase does take cash bribes.
[4148.44 → 4149.16] Not necessary.
[4150.26 → 4150.58] Oh.
[4151.08 → 4152.32] Are we going back to the tricks' thing?
[4152.32 → 4156.22] No, no, no.
[4156.22 → 4156.54] It's fine.
[4156.70 → 4158.54] We'll just, we'll just, we'll just, it'll be fine.
[4158.72 → 4164.90] I don't even mind people doing the thing that Luke is probably talking about.
[4165.46 → 4167.72] If the ticket is for their own use.
[4167.90 → 4168.12] Yeah.
[4168.58 → 4169.32] That's fine.
[4169.42 → 4169.64] Yes.
[4170.68 → 4171.96] But I could see us.
[4172.06 → 4173.18] We've never scalped a ticket.
[4173.26 → 4177.90] If the thing you're alluding to and not saying explicitly until you just did for some reason.
[4178.38 → 4178.80] What do you mean?
[4179.32 → 4179.80] Oh, sure.
[4179.92 → 4180.10] Yeah.
[4180.10 → 4181.30] So, oh, okay.
[4181.38 → 4182.16] You're, you're, you're, you're right.
[4182.16 → 4183.08] You didn't say the thing.
[4183.14 → 4183.94] You said a different thing.
[4184.06 → 4184.20] Yeah.
[4184.26 → 4184.56] It's fine.
[4184.60 → 4184.90] It's fine.
[4185.10 → 4191.98] The point is that if the thing that Luke is alluding to, but not saying becomes a problem,
[4191.98 → 4198.66] we could end up binding the ticket to the account of the person who bought it and stuff.
[4198.88 → 4200.50] Like we, it could come to that.
[4200.84 → 4201.70] That would still be fine.
[4202.64 → 4203.38] I know.
[4203.50 → 4204.14] You can just do that.
[4204.30 → 4205.22] I just mean.
[4205.32 → 4205.88] It's not a bad idea.
[4206.46 → 4207.96] Scalping is a problem.
[4208.16 → 4208.46] Yes.
[4208.80 → 4209.28] And I.
[4209.28 → 4210.80] We've genuinely never scalped a ticket.
[4210.96 → 4212.14] I'm not, I'm not just saying.
[4212.16 → 4212.72] Okay.
[4212.84 → 4213.44] It's never happened.
[4213.68 → 4218.28] There are times when we ended up with extra tickets because someone decided they couldn't
[4218.28 → 4220.70] go, and we have always sold at cost.
[4221.30 → 4221.78] Okay.
[4221.80 → 4222.90] Never, never scalped a ticket.
[4223.22 → 4223.56] All right.
[4223.84 → 4224.22] All right.
[4225.06 → 4227.90] Space dust says, please kill scalping once and for all.
[4227.90 → 4228.36] Oh, dude.
[4229.64 → 4230.46] Fully agreed.
[4230.60 → 4231.48] It's so annoying.
[4231.62 → 4233.88] If I could hold up the scalp of scalping, I would.
[4234.20 → 4234.62] Oh, wow.
[4234.62 → 4236.70] Oh, wow.
[4237.46 → 4238.04] I like it.
[4239.58 → 4239.98] Okay.
[4240.34 → 4241.20] Dan, hit us.
[4242.34 → 4244.32] Why does Linus hate Australians?
[4244.60 → 4244.76] What?
[4245.08 → 4246.02] That's a good question.
[4246.32 → 4247.64] What are you talking about?
[4247.68 → 4248.14] Can you elaborate?
[4248.54 → 4250.74] Do you have, do you have context for this?
[4250.74 → 4250.94] No.
[4251.00 → 4251.66] Or are you just playing along?
[4251.66 → 4253.12] I'm just messing around.
[4253.50 → 4254.36] I have no clue.
[4254.44 → 4255.76] What do you mean I hate Australians?
[4255.76 → 4258.12] Are they just going to try to blame like shipping or something?
[4258.24 → 4259.20] It's not our fault.
[4259.34 → 4261.94] They're basically South Canadian as far as I can tell.
[4261.94 → 4266.14] I really do think the like closest kinship Canada has with any other country is probably
[4266.14 → 4266.72] Australia.
[4266.94 → 4268.22] As random as that is.
[4268.22 → 4269.86] Who are we most similar to?
[4274.14 → 4274.74] Okay.
[4274.94 → 4278.58] I'm just going to list sort of like ones I've heard.
[4279.14 → 4279.34] Okay.
[4279.34 → 4280.10] So the Danish.
[4280.28 → 4282.08] We've been compared to the Danish.
[4282.30 → 4282.72] Okay.
[4283.02 → 4284.06] It's offensive, but okay.
[4285.28 → 4292.72] I think that, I think that Northern, I think that Northern Americans, and by that I don't
[4292.72 → 4293.62] mean North Americans.
[4293.62 → 4298.74] I mean, Northern United States of Americans, I think have a pretty, have a pretty strong
[4298.74 → 4299.04] kinship.
[4299.04 → 4300.20] Yeah, but that's not the whole country.
[4300.46 → 4301.34] I know.
[4301.48 → 4301.84] I know.
[4302.36 → 4307.82] I'm just saying that like Minnesotans appear to be just like honorary Canadians, a lot of
[4307.82 → 4307.98] them.
[4309.06 → 4318.18] And I really can't tell the difference between like, basically like Washington State, Oregon.
[4318.18 → 4318.54] Oregon.
[4318.88 → 4319.16] Yeah.
[4319.36 → 4321.82] Like their kind of our Pacific Northwest bros.
[4321.82 → 4326.10] There's kind of like the, the, the BC, Washington State, Oregon is kind of like its own.
[4326.42 → 4328.48] Like if we were just our own country.
[4328.72 → 4329.16] PNW.
[4329.16 → 4335.36] I think probably no one would object to Pacific Northwestistan, like within those three.
[4335.52 → 4336.04] Probably not.
[4336.76 → 4339.04] Culturally, like we seem to be very similar.
[4339.32 → 4340.08] It'd probably be fine.
[4341.60 → 4342.04] Cascadia.
[4342.26 → 4342.44] Yeah.
[4342.50 → 4343.58] Let's go Cascadia.
[4343.94 → 4345.44] But then that's not all of Canada.
[4345.88 → 4346.62] I know.
[4346.62 → 4346.90] I know.
[4346.96 → 4347.18] I know.
[4348.34 → 4348.78] Australians.
[4349.16 → 4349.38] Yes.
[4349.52 → 4349.76] Yes.
[4349.78 → 4351.78] That's another one I've heard.
[4351.92 → 4352.58] That's about it.
[4353.98 → 4357.96] Of those, I'd say, yeah, the Australians, because they, they feel a lot of the same pain.
[4358.22 → 4361.06] They have an incredible amount of fraud, just like we do.
[4361.20 → 4368.16] They, they have a devalued crappy currency, but they, but they have Western costs like we
[4368.16 → 4368.46] do.
[4368.98 → 4373.72] Land mass to population density is like almost as bad as Canada or worse.
[4373.72 → 4374.72] A huge problem.
[4374.72 → 4379.20] A huge problem, like logistically and like for infrastructure, which I guess are kind of the
[4379.20 → 4379.70] same thing.
[4379.96 → 4381.42] They do have more than one road.
[4381.86 → 4382.14] Mm-hmm.
[4382.54 → 4383.06] Um.
[4383.06 → 4383.46] Yeah.
[4383.46 → 4383.48] Yeah.
[4383.48 → 4384.72] So that we don't have in common.
[4384.88 → 4386.00] We just have the one.
[4386.30 → 4386.44] Yep.
[4387.48 → 4387.96] Um.
[4388.02 → 4390.08] Their housing market is also f***ed.
[4390.48 → 4390.58] So.
[4390.80 → 4391.62] For a similar reason.
[4391.76 → 4391.90] Yep.
[4392.08 → 4396.56] They, they also are, are like natural resource, fairly rich.
[4396.56 → 4397.26] Oh yeah.
[4397.38 → 4397.62] Yep.
[4398.26 → 4398.52] Yep.
[4398.52 → 4398.64] Yep.
[4398.64 → 4404.52] But, um, I, I don't think I can think of a major global company that is Australia based.
[4405.60 → 4406.88] I'm sure there are some.
[4407.10 → 4408.40] A lot of mineral ones.
[4408.74 → 4409.10] Sure.
[4409.64 → 4410.88] But I know what you mean.
[4411.14 → 4416.16] Like in terms of like Fintech or like, like what we think of as, you know, your.
[4416.22 → 4417.08] I'm sure they are.
[4417.36 → 4417.76] Atlassian.
[4417.92 → 4418.32] Oh yeah.
[4418.40 → 4418.56] Yeah.
[4418.56 → 4418.72] Yeah.
[4418.72 → 4419.08] Big time.
[4419.08 → 4420.02] Oh Atlassian.
[4420.10 → 4420.16] Okay.
[4420.16 → 4420.82] I didn't know that.
[4420.88 → 4423.44] So they've got the one just like us with Shopify then.
[4423.66 → 4424.30] Ha ha ha.
[4424.30 → 4428.68] Noctua?
[4428.80 → 4429.70] No, that's the other.
[4429.92 → 4430.10] Yeah.
[4430.18 → 4431.36] That's, that's Austria.
[4431.56 → 4431.80] Yeah.
[4432.00 → 4432.46] Not Australia.
[4433.20 → 4434.98] They are not in fact the same thing.
[4435.76 → 4440.22] Doesn't it, isn't it like Austria has a section of their airport specifically designed for
[4440.22 → 4442.48] people who end up there that thought they were going to Australia?
[4442.96 → 4443.60] Isn't that a thing?
[4443.62 → 4444.00] Shut up.
[4444.00 → 4444.58] Am I just talking?
[4444.58 → 4446.30] It sounds like a squeeze jibs thing.
[4446.56 → 4448.96] I hope I didn't just hear that, and it's a joke.
[4449.16 → 4450.38] That's got to be a joke.
[4451.10 → 4452.40] Squeeze jibs India.
[4452.40 → 4453.24] With a.
[4453.24 → 4454.76] People are saying it's a thing.
[4454.86 → 4456.52] You have got to be kidding me right now.
[4456.94 → 4458.88] I went to India, not Indiana.
[4459.42 → 4460.72] Just tell me you don't love me.
[4462.10 → 4462.48] Ha ha.
[4463.08 → 4463.76] Love squeeze.
[4464.92 → 4467.86] There's a desk in Salzburg airport.
[4468.54 → 4468.88] Sorry.
[4469.14 → 4470.76] This is Austria, not Australia.
[4470.98 → 4471.46] Need help?
[4471.58 → 4472.26] Press the button.
[4472.82 → 4475.04] And you can press the button, and it's like an SOS thing.
[4475.68 → 4477.06] Are you flipping?
[4477.06 → 4478.48] Oh, wait.
[4478.84 → 4481.20] No, there is no actual pavilion.
[4481.20 → 4481.64] Not real news.
[4481.78 → 4482.40] Says AI.
[4482.56 → 4482.86] Okay.
[4483.60 → 4485.48] A look at what didn't happen this week.
[4485.58 → 4485.84] Okay.
[4485.94 → 4486.18] Okay.
[4486.24 → 4487.42] So this is not real then.
[4488.14 → 4488.94] That sucks.
[4489.12 → 4491.48] It would have been so much funnier if it was real.
[4492.42 → 4494.06] Highly upvoted on 9gag.
[4494.22 → 4494.50] Okay.
[4494.66 → 4494.84] Yeah.
[4494.90 → 4495.16] Okay.
[4495.26 → 4495.52] Okay.
[4495.56 → 4495.80] Okay.
[4495.80 → 4496.58] So not a real thing.
[4498.36 → 4498.80] Dang.
[4499.66 → 4500.02] Okay.
[4500.26 → 4502.20] That would have been so funny.
[4503.16 → 4504.70] They should just do it as a joke.
[4504.70 → 4507.68] It seems like the kind of thing Australians would do.
[4508.56 → 4509.82] Austrians in this case.
[4510.38 → 4510.80] Oh, right.
[4512.90 → 4516.68] But the Australians could go there and put that sign on the desk.
[4517.12 → 4517.76] Send it.
[4518.08 → 4518.48] Do it up.
[4519.40 → 4523.58] I mean, there's that whole thing too where like the ski hills around here.
[4524.24 → 4528.26] If you go to one of the ski hills in the winter, the chance that you're dealing with
[4528.26 → 4531.98] an Australian employee is like very high.
[4532.58 → 4533.06] Yeah.
[4533.06 → 4533.12] Yeah.
[4534.06 → 4537.04] I've always kind of wondered why that's a thing.
[4537.30 → 4538.16] It's a...
[4538.16 → 4538.52] It's...
[4538.52 → 4541.72] Apparently, it's really easy to get the visa or something.
[4541.84 → 4544.62] I've also heard its Surfer Bros and they season swap.
[4546.28 → 4546.76] Oh.
[4547.08 → 4556.40] But can you imagine in all the world of places you can surf choosing cold Pacific Northwest
[4556.40 → 4556.98] water?
[4557.18 → 4557.78] It's like a surf...
[4557.78 → 4558.00] Oh.
[4558.44 → 4559.06] No, no, no.
[4559.06 → 4562.20] They come up here to do like boarding and skiing and stuff, and then they go back and
[4562.20 → 4562.98] go surfing in Australia.
[4563.10 → 4563.86] That makes way more sense.
[4564.02 → 4564.18] Yeah.
[4564.82 → 4566.86] That makes so much more sense.
[4566.94 → 4568.10] And I've just heard that's a thing.
[4568.18 → 4569.12] Like, I don't actually know.
[4569.24 → 4570.68] But I was kind of questioning it one time.
[4570.76 → 4571.32] So I went up to...
[4571.32 → 4575.26] I went up to Seymour and like literally every single person was Australian.
[4575.26 → 4575.44] Yeah.
[4575.44 → 4575.90] No, it's the thing.
[4575.90 → 4577.58] Like, the chance of this is nuts.
[4577.74 → 4579.66] It's been a thing for so long.
[4579.68 → 4584.70] And there's like an employment thing where like by working there, and I could be wrong
[4584.70 → 4585.04] about this.
[4585.10 → 4585.48] I don't know.
[4585.56 → 4587.42] Just like the Austria sign thing.
[4587.42 → 4587.52] Oh, yeah.
[4587.52 → 4588.10] I'm not really certain.
[4588.30 → 4592.88] I think they get like food and housing as part of their compensation.
[4593.10 → 4596.52] Food, housing, and free lift passes as part of their compensation.
[4596.92 → 4597.16] Right.
[4597.28 → 4598.26] And they make some money.
[4598.80 → 4600.52] So then they just kind of do all the above.
[4601.58 → 4602.22] That's a thing.
[4602.30 → 4602.44] Yeah.
[4602.52 → 4602.70] Yeah.
[4602.70 → 4603.08] I've heard.
[4603.68 → 4606.20] No, don't forget Aussie summer is Canadian winter.
[4606.40 → 4608.56] So maybe they're ski bros in both places.
[4609.00 → 4609.40] Yeah.
[4609.66 → 4610.30] I also...
[4610.30 → 4613.70] Do you really want to surf in Aussie summer?
[4614.60 → 4616.80] That sounds like it might roast you.
[4616.80 → 4619.42] But the water would be warm at least.
[4619.62 → 4620.42] Could you surf?
[4620.84 → 4621.88] What is their winter like?
[4621.90 → 4622.90] Is it actually cold?
[4623.90 → 4625.98] I've never been to Australian winter.
[4626.20 → 4627.38] I've never been to Australian anything.
[4628.06 → 4629.70] I don't think it's freezing though.
[4631.00 → 4631.42] Yeah.
[4631.50 → 4632.18] No LOL.
[4632.18 → 4633.98] So yeah, you could probably still surf.
[4634.36 → 4634.76] I don't know.
[4634.96 → 4635.52] I have no idea.
[4636.24 → 4636.48] I don't know.
[4636.56 → 4640.90] So I bet you base the season around being able to snowboard more than you do being able
[4640.90 → 4641.34] to surf.
[4641.82 → 4642.56] Either way.
[4642.84 → 4643.54] Either way.
[4643.74 → 4645.56] Australia is definitely on my list.
[4646.16 → 4647.80] 15 deg sea in winter.
[4648.74 → 4651.10] So they might think it's cold.
[4651.56 → 4651.96] Okay.
[4653.78 → 4654.84] They've got spiders.
[4654.98 → 4655.82] See, that's the thing.
[4655.96 → 4656.54] We wouldn't call that cold.
[4656.60 → 4657.32] That's the thing.
[4657.32 → 4660.62] I don't actually like big spiders.
[4663.58 → 4666.40] But Australia is still on my list of places that I want to go.
[4666.48 → 4667.62] I want to go to Australia sometime too.
[4667.80 → 4668.00] Yeah.
[4668.70 → 4669.38] It's just...
[4669.38 → 4670.94] It's not a lot of like tech conventions and stuff.
[4670.98 → 4672.42] It's so far.
[4672.66 → 4673.22] It's very far.
[4673.22 → 4674.06] It's really far.
[4674.26 → 4676.64] Could you guys just be not so far?
[4677.64 → 4681.76] Could you all just like, I don't know, put some outboard motors on the back of the continent?
[4681.98 → 4684.36] Just kind of cruise over this way.
[4684.48 → 4687.46] Honestly, just like smash it into northern BC.
[4688.50 → 4689.20] Just join up.
[4689.84 → 4690.20] Yeah.
[4690.20 → 4691.42] I'd be down.
[4691.58 → 4691.98] That'd be cool.
[4692.50 → 4692.80] Do it up.
[4693.36 → 4694.56] Why northern BC?
[4694.72 → 4696.50] Why would you want anybody to have to live there?
[4696.60 → 4697.40] Because if you did southern, you'd whack into...
[4697.40 → 4697.82] So cold.
[4698.18 → 4699.72] You'd whack into Vancouver Island.
[4700.32 → 4702.26] And Australia is so big, it would just take it out.
[4702.88 → 4703.74] I guess that's true.
[4703.78 → 4704.42] That kind of sucks.
[4704.56 → 4706.46] But then we wouldn't have to take the ferry to Victoria.
[4707.44 → 4707.76] Hmm.
[4707.82 → 4709.92] If they just kind of like pushed Vancouver Island in.
[4710.00 → 4710.30] Uh-huh.
[4710.52 → 4711.10] I like it.
[4711.80 → 4712.38] Now we're cooking.
[4713.28 → 4715.76] Maybe they could just grab Hawaii on the way over.
[4716.78 → 4719.68] Mind you, Hawaii would suck if it wasn't still hot though.
[4719.68 → 4727.00] Like if Hawaii had our weather, it would just sort of be a downer because all the like nice tropical like vegetation would die.
[4727.00 → 4729.00] Yeah, and if they're grabbing it, then it would just get it kind of smashed in the middle as well.
[4729.02 → 4730.42] I think they should leave it where it is.
[4730.48 → 4730.74] Sure.
[4730.94 → 4733.62] Yeah, Oprah probably wouldn't want to be a British Columbian.
[4733.64 → 4734.34] Or a Zuckerberg.
[4734.50 → 4734.74] Yeah.
[4735.02 → 4736.58] And we don't really want Zuckerberg.
[4736.64 → 4736.88] No.
[4737.00 → 4737.66] In either case.
[4737.92 → 4738.20] Yeah.
[4738.54 → 4740.00] Maybe either of them.
[4741.38 → 4741.88] All right.
[4742.00 → 4742.36] They can stay.
[4743.10 → 4744.18] Yeah, they can stay where they are.
[4745.04 → 4747.34] Or the Hawaiians can kick them out.
[4747.38 → 4748.08] That's fine too.
[4748.18 → 4748.82] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4748.82 → 4750.54] Because that's kind of a thing, I think.
[4750.56 → 4750.88] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4754.62 → 4755.20] Oh, yeah.
[4755.26 → 4755.86] More topics.
[4756.68 → 4758.16] What do you want to talk about next?
[4758.74 → 4759.10] Me?
[4759.60 → 4759.96] Yeah.
[4759.96 → 4762.58] Let's skip a bunch of the junk.
[4763.48 → 4765.54] Let's just jump to a cool one.
[4766.50 → 4769.20] I scrolled a decent amount down the document.
[4770.40 → 4772.42] Because this was awesome.
[4772.66 → 4775.60] And I mean, this is, I don't even think this is the first time we've talked about this channel
[4775.60 → 4779.32] on WAN Show, let alone on any of our channels.
[4779.32 → 4785.14] But YouTuber, basically homeless, made a real life aim bot that controls his body.
[4785.14 → 4788.42] And my God, was I jealous.
[4788.56 → 4791.12] I wanted to do this so bad the whole time I was watching the video.
[4791.58 → 4797.06] In a recent video, he made a neuromuscular aim bot that uses machine vision to control an
[4797.06 → 4798.52] EMS-10s machine.
[4799.02 → 4803.82] That's when you see like the little pads on people that induce electrical impulses that
[4803.82 → 4804.40] move your muscles.
[4804.40 → 4806.24] That's what an EMS-10s machine is.
[4806.56 → 4811.20] To contract the muscles in his right arm, hand, and trigger finger.
[4811.44 → 4812.76] That was a really cool part of the video.
[4812.92 → 4816.50] To help him react and aim in CS2 at inhuman speeds.
[4816.76 → 4821.00] While the results were a little inconsistent, when everything was working as intended, the
[4821.00 → 4822.86] aim bot definitely gave him an edge.
[4823.20 → 4825.42] Especially, ah, no.
[4826.02 → 4826.96] I'm not going to say what.
[4826.96 → 4834.10] There's an interesting curve partway through the video that makes it like wildly effective.
[4835.14 → 4837.38] Very, very, very, very interesting.
[4838.14 → 4842.76] The video is fascinating, so you should definitely watch it, as well as a bunch of
[4842.76 → 4845.24] basically Homeless's other really wild tech experiments.
[4845.38 → 4846.26] It makes really cool stuff.
[4846.56 → 4850.68] Yeah, I'm not going to, I'm intentionally not really giving you guys too much here.
[4850.90 → 4851.10] Yeah.
[4851.20 → 4856.64] But I'm giving you, I'm giving you enough of some pretty cool looking wacky stuff.
[4856.64 → 4857.92] Dude, it's so sick.
[4858.74 → 4859.98] It's such a cool video.
[4859.98 → 4865.08] So, the conversation, wait, did you actually like to read the doc thing at all, or you just
[4865.08 → 4866.02] went for it?
[4866.30 → 4867.56] I kind of went for it.
[4867.68 → 4868.02] Cool.
[4868.62 → 4870.02] No, I read the whole doc, actually.
[4870.28 → 4872.02] I didn't read any of the questions.
[4872.40 → 4875.94] So, the part that I think was missing was that he's using machine vision.
[4877.10 → 4877.42] So...
[4877.42 → 4878.12] No, I think I said that.
[4878.20 → 4878.56] Oh, cool.
[4878.56 → 4883.66] Our discussion question, then, is, do you consider this cheating?
[4883.66 → 4885.22] Oh, it's definitely cheating.
[4885.44 → 4886.00] Well, why?
[4886.92 → 4887.70] I mean...
[4887.70 → 4892.30] Because your eyeballs aren't doing the detecting, and your finger is not doing the firing.
[4892.58 → 4893.66] I mean, your finger is...
[4893.66 → 4894.30] Whoa...
[4894.30 → 4894.32] Whoa...
[4894.32 → 4894.66] Whoa...
[4894.66 → 4895.08] Whoa...
[4895.08 → 4895.66] Whoa...
[4895.66 → 4896.66] Whoa...
[4896.66 → 4897.66] Whoa...
[4897.66 → 4901.14] That's like saying an exoskeleton in football is not cheating.
[4901.36 → 4901.66] I mean...
[4903.10 → 4905.12] Anyone can build an exoskeleton.
[4906.38 → 4909.76] But you can't bring one into the, into the match.
[4909.96 → 4910.32] No.
[4910.32 → 4910.62] No.
[4911.66 → 4912.82] It's definitely...
[4912.82 → 4913.38] It's definitely cheating.
[4913.38 → 4914.96] Well, I mean, you don't know that you can't until you try.
[4915.06 → 4917.20] He even, like, memes it throughout the video.
[4917.38 → 4918.34] It's, it's definitely cheating.
[4918.36 → 4918.74] I know.
[4918.84 → 4921.50] But it's, it's, it is an interesting conversation.
[4921.90 → 4924.48] Especially because this is just the beginning.
[4924.78 → 4925.08] Yes.
[4925.64 → 4926.28] So...
[4926.28 → 4930.80] The thing that he ends up doing, which, again, I'm not going to actually say, because he deserves
[4930.80 → 4932.20] your view, so go watch it.
[4932.20 → 4940.96] But the thing that he ends up doing is, like, pretty intense and would be a dramatic advantage
[4940.96 → 4945.00] in, like, every game.
[4946.28 → 4948.74] So, yeah, it's a pretty big deal.
[4949.48 → 4958.30] To the point where, like, if it's less detectable because of this, if, it's an if, I could see
[4958.30 → 4958.90] people doing it.
[4959.58 → 4961.08] Like, it's, it's wild.
[4961.40 → 4965.52] He kind of comes across a way of approaching this that is, like, wildly effective.
[4965.52 → 4974.36] So, if you were, if you were a streamer, and you were playing a video game, and we had no
[4974.36 → 4981.28] way of seeing if you have, like, pads and leads hooked up to you, you would consider that
[4981.28 → 4982.60] streamer to be a filthy cheater?
[4982.80 → 4983.00] Yes.
[4983.00 → 4988.26] What if they were playing most of the rest of the game on their own?
[4988.34 → 4989.82] They're throwing their grenades on their own?
[4990.02 → 4992.34] They're activating their special abilities on their own?
[4993.20 → 4995.50] Uh, they wouldn't technically have to in all cases.
[4996.18 → 4996.78] But many...
[4996.78 → 5000.46] Because he, he did arm movement and trigger finger.
[5000.74 → 5005.68] You could, theoretically, if you're playing, like, Data or something, you could machine vision
[5005.68 → 5012.78] it out so that when you have your mouse properly in position for a skill shot, it, like, does
[5012.78 → 5013.22] something.
[5013.56 → 5017.06] Like, it's, it's actually applicable to, like, every game.
[5017.50 → 5019.60] Because it's just reaction time enhancement.
[5020.10 → 5025.80] And you can just modify the action involved with the reaction time enhancement.
[5025.80 → 5032.90] And tons of modern games, even tons of old games, are realistically just entertaining reaction
[5032.90 → 5034.18] time simulators.
[5034.64 → 5035.74] Okay, I love this.
[5036.10 → 5043.80] Avon Fox asks, this is in float plane chat, what if they're using it as an accessibility aid?
[5045.80 → 5048.72] There are a bunch of accessibility aids that are effectively cheating.
[5048.86 → 5049.00] Yeah.
[5049.62 → 5050.04] Okay.
[5050.22 → 5051.44] But what if they need it?
[5051.56 → 5052.40] Then is it cheating?
[5052.74 → 5053.78] Is there a delay?
[5053.78 → 5058.86] Is there a delay that could be programmed into the chain that you would consider acceptable
[5058.86 → 5059.74] and not cheating?
[5060.08 → 5061.24] Like, human average, whatever.
[5061.40 → 5066.64] That's, like, a spot where, like, if you honestly need it, then, like, my, my amount of
[5066.64 → 5068.18] cares go very low.
[5068.38 → 5073.86] But, obviously, I mean, we've known for a long time that there are accessibility controllers
[5073.86 → 5076.24] that are effectively cheating.
[5079.12 → 5081.32] As Lynn at Fulling Chat said, not in competitive play.
[5081.44 → 5082.64] That's an interesting angle.
[5082.64 → 5087.00] But, like, what Linus is saying is, like, eventually, if you take accessibility controllers
[5087.00 → 5092.92] as far as you possibly can, eventually, it's just a bot playing the game.
[5093.72 → 5097.58] If you go all the possible way, which the vast majority of them don't, right?
[5097.96 → 5100.30] But if you do, that is kind of effectively what's happening.
[5100.30 → 5103.80] So, oh, okay.
[5103.94 → 5105.52] Stay the path in float plane chat.
[5105.62 → 5108.04] It says, okay, why is Linus even playing devil's advocate here?
[5108.38 → 5110.28] There is no world where this is not cheating.
[5111.04 → 5112.28] Well, see, that's the thing.
[5112.44 → 5114.56] I was kind of going somewhere with all of this.
[5114.56 → 5116.30] Except there are absolutely...
[5116.94 → 5117.70] What is this?
[5117.70 → 5119.14] There are people who believe...
[5119.14 → 5120.02] Oh, the enhanced games.
[5120.18 → 5120.38] Yep.
[5120.50 → 5128.08] There are people who believe that we should embrace substance use, various types of doping,
[5128.08 → 5133.52] and push the human body to its absolute limit to hell with the consequences.
[5134.36 → 5143.10] And so, no, I don't actually think it is an entirely bullshit argument for me to say,
[5143.22 → 5144.34] okay, but hold on a second.
[5144.78 → 5146.84] Like, where's the line?
[5146.84 → 5149.04] Where it's just chess computers against chess computers.
[5150.28 → 5151.70] Like, this is a thing.
[5152.18 → 5155.12] And just most people don't care because it's not very interesting.
[5155.56 → 5155.66] Yeah.
[5155.66 → 5161.82] So, I think it runs down the same path of, like, you have to keep the legitimacy of the competition
[5161.82 → 5164.92] as people and their own natural faculties.
[5164.92 → 5170.30] Because if you go beyond that, then the line becomes too difficult.
[5170.54 → 5172.32] But then what about the accessibility question?
[5172.94 → 5173.08] Yeah.
[5173.18 → 5174.84] And then that's where competition gets weird.
[5174.84 → 5177.08] Because, like, there are...
[5177.08 → 5180.18] Like, as far as my understanding goes, you know how...
[5180.18 → 5189.74] Let's say in running, if somebody doesn't have, like, legs below the knees, you get those blade things.
[5189.88 → 5190.10] Yep.
[5190.40 → 5191.00] Really cool.
[5191.36 → 5191.62] Yep.
[5191.88 → 5198.18] I'm pretty sure you couldn't elect to run with those if you didn't need them.
[5200.20 → 5201.48] Yeah, that's fair.
[5201.68 → 5202.52] I don't think you can do that.
[5202.52 → 5204.76] So, I don't think you would be able to...
[5204.76 → 5209.04] As, like, kind of sucky as this is, I don't think you could just join standard competition
[5209.04 → 5211.52] and be like, I'm a...
[5211.52 → 5213.64] What was it called when you have no limbs?
[5214.94 → 5215.38] MPT?
[5217.14 → 5217.58] Quadriplegic?
[5217.88 → 5218.44] Oh, well, that's...
[5218.44 → 5218.62] Yeah.
[5218.78 → 5219.66] That's no limbs.
[5220.02 → 5222.56] And be like, I'm going to compete in Counter-Strike.
[5223.48 → 5227.02] I'm going to use various assistant aides.
[5227.22 → 5229.46] By the way, my reaction time is...
[5229.46 → 5229.80] Zero.
[5230.12 → 5230.46] Zero.
[5230.46 → 5230.50] Zero.
[5231.10 → 5231.22] Right.
[5231.24 → 5232.46] So, have fun, everyone.
[5233.34 → 5234.46] Like, that's not...
[5235.54 → 5239.30] As unfortunate as that is, that's not in the spirit of competition.
[5240.62 → 5241.72] So, it doesn't really work.
[5241.98 → 5242.36] Mm-hmm.
[5243.52 → 5246.26] The Olympics and Paralympics have the exact same issue.
[5246.46 → 5246.60] Yeah.
[5247.10 → 5248.00] Yeah, that's fair.
[5249.26 → 5249.70] Paraplegic.
[5249.96 → 5250.16] Okay.
[5250.42 → 5250.68] Sure.
[5250.68 → 5250.72] Sure.
[5250.72 → 5251.62] My bad.
[5252.48 → 5253.94] Well, para would just be legs, though.
[5253.94 → 5256.84] As far as I understand.
[5257.10 → 5258.32] I'm not an...
[5258.32 → 5260.58] Yeah.
[5264.78 → 5269.18] So, it gets tricky, right?
[5269.38 → 5277.06] Do you think that if this could be embedded, like, in your body and hidden, that there would
[5277.06 → 5280.32] be people who would be willing to go that far to get good?
[5280.44 → 5281.52] Oh, I think you could.
[5282.46 → 5282.74] Mm-hmm.
[5283.94 → 5284.82] Uh...
[5284.82 → 5285.16] Mm-hmm.
[5285.16 → 5286.06] Which gets weird.
[5288.18 → 5289.88] And I absolutely think there would be.
[5290.48 → 5290.64] Mm-hmm.
[5290.64 → 5294.94] I mean, you look at the amount of people cheating while live-streaming, and it's...
[5294.94 → 5296.94] Like, cheating these days is a...
[5296.94 → 5300.26] It's almost its own competition.
[5300.94 → 5301.08] Yeah.
[5301.08 → 5302.78] It's like, who can cheat the best?
[5303.06 → 5303.26] Yeah.
[5303.96 → 5306.24] It's a really wild thing.
[5307.10 → 5308.68] Cheat Up says, and then they play Markov.
[5309.08 → 5309.30] Yeah.
[5310.96 → 5313.12] Cheating has kind of totally run over shooters.
[5313.26 → 5313.58] He says...
[5313.58 → 5314.98] I mean, Battlefield 6...
[5314.98 → 5316.92] I don't know if we've talked about that much on WAN Show.
[5317.58 → 5320.58] I don't think we really could have, because I think the beta started last weekend.
[5320.58 → 5325.22] But Battlefield 6 is in open beta now.
[5325.46 → 5330.42] And in the first day of Battlefield being in open beta, people were cheating on live servers.
[5331.08 → 5333.00] How is that even possible?
[5333.30 → 5334.04] Generic ones.
[5334.24 → 5334.92] Like, what am I...
[5334.92 → 5336.08] It's got really Draconian...
[5336.08 → 5336.80] Or engine-based ones, whatever.
[5336.80 → 5338.62] ...anti-cheat as well.
[5338.62 → 5338.84] It does.
[5338.84 → 5339.88] It's like kernel level.
[5340.06 → 5340.68] It's crazy.
[5340.76 → 5341.68] And people were still cheating.
[5341.78 → 5341.98] Yeah.
[5342.54 → 5343.26] Like, it's...
[5343.26 → 5344.50] This is just...
[5344.50 → 5350.36] It's an insane industry, and it's a thing that we just have to deal with at this point.
[5350.88 → 5357.10] And the reason why I'm so frustrated with companies like BSG, the people that make Markov,
[5357.10 → 5360.42] is because they won't include a like, replay system.
[5360.72 → 5368.52] Because there is no reality where BSG will ever get Markov to a point where it's an acceptable level of cheating.
[5368.86 → 5370.90] There is way too much money behind it.
[5371.06 → 5372.78] For the other side...
[5372.78 → 5379.06] I'm not even talking about the conspiracy theft where BSG is actually profiting off of it because they ban all the cheaters,
[5379.16 → 5381.14] and the cheaters all buy new accounts, and they make money from that.
[5381.34 → 5382.64] I'm not even talking about that.
[5382.70 → 5387.98] I'm purely saying that the people attacking, the people making cheats for Markov,
[5388.14 → 5391.56] there's so much money for them in it that BSG is never going to win.
[5391.56 → 5397.54] And in that case, you have to arm the users, and they're not doing that in any way.
[5397.72 → 5402.18] Speaking of arming users, Gfreak01 in float plane chat says,
[5402.48 → 5405.78] I could see the military using something like this.
[5406.22 → 5408.80] There are use cases other than gaming competitions.
[5409.08 → 5409.48] Yeah, of course.
[5409.94 → 5411.76] So could you foresee...
[5411.76 → 5413.04] I mean, kind of like...
[5413.04 → 5415.32] What were the Nazis all hopped up on amphetamines?
[5415.48 → 5415.74] Meth.
[5415.74 → 5424.06] Could you see a use case where this becomes part of your onboarding?
[5424.14 → 5425.82] Isn't this sort of already a thing for fighter jets?
[5427.46 → 5428.50] That's a good question.
[5428.76 → 5429.54] It aims where you...
[5429.54 → 5430.72] I don't pilot a fighter jet.
[5430.84 → 5434.12] This may surprise you, but I am not a fighter jet pilot.
[5434.18 → 5434.54] I don't actually know.
[5434.54 → 5436.90] I think with helicopters, it aims where you look,
[5437.50 → 5444.10] and I think with the jets, it will like auto-prime so that it's ready to fire,
[5444.10 → 5445.72] but you still have to do the input.
[5445.74 → 5448.42] I think those are things.
[5448.52 → 5449.34] Am I wrong?
[5451.10 → 5453.12] The helmet aims where you look.
[5453.36 → 5453.58] Yeah.
[5455.96 → 5456.68] Head tracking?
[5456.78 → 5461.24] No, I know there's head tracking, but I thought it like did something else as well.
[5461.44 → 5462.28] Like it got...
[5462.28 → 5464.94] Like maybe it spun up, but didn't start firing or something.
[5465.72 → 5467.20] Dan, do you know a fighter pilot?
[5468.16 → 5469.64] Seems like the kind of thing you would know.
[5470.54 → 5470.90] No.
[5471.28 → 5472.40] You don't know a fighter pilot?
[5472.40 → 5473.04] I'm Canadian.
[5473.26 → 5475.66] I only know our two military guys in their canoe.
[5475.94 → 5476.64] That's all we have.
[5477.60 → 5478.54] He knows both of them, though.
[5478.62 → 5479.34] How are you doing, Dave?
[5479.66 → 5481.58] Have you ever seen a military canoe?
[5481.78 → 5487.08] This is a question for like our American and European, Australian, overseas viewers.
[5487.14 → 5487.94] Yeah, they might not have.
[5488.06 → 5490.14] They might not have actually encountered one.
[5490.14 → 5492.92] The hull is actually the...
[5492.92 → 5496.50] Like the cedar is quite a lot thicker than a standard canoe.
[5496.50 → 5509.52] And you need so much strength to paddle that canoe at ramming speed that you can't just rely on like the upper bodies of the occupants of our two military officers.
[5510.02 → 5511.34] You need beavers to...
[5511.34 → 5512.66] Sorry, I can't even give a straight face.
[5512.66 → 5514.74] It's got to be able to withstand an Manukau torpedo.
[5514.74 → 5515.18] Yeah.
[5516.86 → 5517.72] You never know what's going to happen.
[5517.72 → 5520.16] The Sunderland says, can't tell if Linus is trolling.
[5520.66 → 5525.82] Yeah, we don't keep the sticks on the frozen lake when we're doing military invasions.
[5526.26 → 5526.44] Eh.
[5526.44 → 5529.66] Normally, you keep the sticks on the ice, you know.
[5530.50 → 5532.12] But, uh, no, look at this.
[5533.68 → 5534.08] AH64D.
[5534.14 → 5535.08] Someone posted in full pitch.
[5535.14 → 5535.66] I'd have lost their name.
[5535.72 → 5535.90] Sorry.
[5536.08 → 5542.68] But Apache attack helicopter features a nose-mounted sensor turret with target acquisition sight and laser designator.
[5543.06 → 5544.66] It's doing stuff already.
[5545.06 → 5547.14] Look up the fighter jet helmets.
[5547.14 → 5548.60] They're like 400 grand.
[5548.80 → 5549.20] Crazy.
[5549.44 → 5554.08] It's shortening the time between when you would be able to fire.
[5554.34 → 5554.66] Right.
[5554.66 → 5558.86] Which is, I think, related, at least, to what we're talking about.
[5558.86 → 5559.54] But would you see them...
[5559.54 → 5560.18] It's not pulling the trigger.
[5560.30 → 5560.44] Yeah.
[5560.52 → 5563.16] Would you see them putting a thing in the arm?
[5563.44 → 5564.70] But at that point, why bother?
[5564.82 → 5565.66] You just have a drone.
[5566.12 → 5566.52] Exactly.
[5566.74 → 5566.88] Yeah.
[5566.88 → 5568.68] I think by the time you do that, you just have a robot.
[5572.28 → 5572.68] Yeah.
[5572.94 → 5573.48] I think so.
[5577.44 → 5579.64] PSO says, don't worry, Linus.
[5580.00 → 5584.64] Us Europeans will stay ahead of your military canoes with our military biceps.
[5584.66 → 5585.00] Tentacles.
[5585.74 → 5586.66] Join forces.
[5591.30 → 5592.16] Oh my goodness.
[5592.36 → 5592.64] Anyway.
[5592.80 → 5596.90] Who was it who went up against the German panzers with horses again?
[5596.90 → 5603.60] Who had the last horse-mounted cavalry unit?
[5604.60 → 5607.78] Horse-mounted cavalry unit.
[5608.10 → 5609.38] Was it the Poles?
[5609.38 → 5620.36] The last horse-mounted cavalry charge by a U.S. unit apparently occurred in the Philippines during World War II.
[5621.30 → 5621.82] Okay.
[5621.90 → 5622.14] Hold on.
[5622.18 → 5623.20] This is just U.S.
[5623.20 → 5625.24] The U.S.
[5625.32 → 5626.54] Oh, World War II.
[5626.64 → 5631.30] The U.S., Soviets, and Polish armies all employed cavalry with varying degrees of success.
[5631.30 → 5639.04] I think the one I'm thinking of is the Austrians, and the varying degree of success was pretty low.
[5641.14 → 5642.72] Poland fought Germany.
[5642.76 → 5643.00] Oh, no.
[5643.08 → 5643.24] Sorry.
[5643.30 → 5643.68] The Poles.
[5643.74 → 5643.88] Yeah.
[5644.12 → 5644.34] Sorry.
[5644.42 → 5645.08] I had to say Austrian.
[5645.18 → 5646.38] Someone said Austrian in the chat.
[5646.38 → 5647.98] I think it was the Poles I was thinking of.
[5648.48 → 5648.58] Yeah.
[5648.66 → 5651.68] Poland fought Germany with horses and did great, says Funny Hats.
[5654.44 → 5654.88] Yikes.
[5657.66 → 5658.92] Oh, hold on a second.
[5659.48 → 5661.56] Patch in Progress says, noteworthy.
[5661.68 → 5665.84] The much derided cavalry units of Poland in World War II actually did really well.
[5666.24 → 5667.70] No, I've heard they did great.
[5667.82 → 5668.10] Yeah, yeah.
[5668.18 → 5668.50] Okay.
[5668.60 → 5668.96] All right.
[5668.96 → 5669.70] Well, good job.
[5671.72 → 5674.20] It was at the beginning of World War II.
[5674.32 → 5675.34] It was a very weird time.
[5675.34 → 5685.52] A lot of – I mean, that's sort of true with almost every major war is you start with what you've got, and then you go, oh, wow, technology is really advanced.
[5686.06 → 5689.22] And then what happens changes significantly by the end of the war.
[5690.46 → 5698.42] That's one of the reasons why Ukraine is so interesting right now is you saw the whole drone thing that some people have been talking about forever.
[5699.08 → 5702.70] Some people finally actually like really happened.
[5702.70 → 5703.32] Yeah.
[5703.32 → 5705.34] And everybody's like, oh, wow.
[5705.48 → 5713.72] And now defence tech is like putting nets on vehicles instead of putting thicker and thicker layers of armour, which is weird.
[5714.10 → 5714.42] Yeah.
[5714.42 → 5722.34] And it's – there's also a lot of conversation around domestic manufacturing capacity.
[5722.74 → 5722.98] Yeah.
[5722.98 → 5729.62] Because it seems like the next major conflict could basically just come down to who can manufacture the most little lightweight drones.
[5729.62 → 5736.90] The being able to make bullets at home argument is now being able to make a small drone and a small explosive.
[5736.90 → 5743.06] YouTube has started rolling out – oh, wait.
[5743.64 → 5745.14] It says float plane announce.
[5745.86 → 5746.56] Do I do that now?
[5749.56 → 5757.96] scrapyard Wars Episode 2 is here and will be live soon.
[5757.96 → 5760.50] It's not actually quite here.
[5760.62 → 5764.62] They had to make a small change to it before we went live for WAN show.
[5766.92 → 5768.76] Dan is going to look into that.
[5768.86 → 5771.36] But in the meantime, we have a new float plane exclusive for you.
[5771.36 → 5778.86] There is a Why Is WAN Late episode that is apparently 50 minutes long.
[5779.24 → 5779.64] Wow.
[5779.64 → 5782.16] How is this so long?
[5782.72 → 5783.14] Wow.
[5783.26 → 5783.74] Oh, wow.
[5783.80 → 5785.46] It includes all kinds of stuff.
[5786.56 → 5792.00] It's basically Why Is WAN Late has become a giant just behind the scenes.
[5792.02 → 5792.82] It's just a vlog.
[5793.14 → 5793.44] Yeah.
[5793.66 → 5796.18] Of what's happening at LMG on Fridays.
[5797.10 → 5797.62] Yeah.
[5798.22 → 5799.64] Which is pretty cool, actually.
[5799.64 → 5800.50] That is kind of cool.
[5800.76 → 5801.12] I'm not against –
[5801.12 → 5805.22] Because Luke and I don't get to know why and the before.
[5805.66 → 5808.34] I actually end up watching a lot of these because it's like, huh.
[5808.34 → 5810.02] I should watch them too.
[5810.02 → 5811.34] Because we just sit here and wait.
[5812.46 → 5815.92] Here's me talking to Tim about overclocking Thread ripper.
[5817.24 → 5819.44] Did I say Tim to John?
[5820.98 → 5821.38] Sorry.
[5823.06 → 5824.58] Here's Sammy Zeeman.
[5825.30 → 5831.36] There's a point here that I was trying to find where Pouffe and I, for reasons unknown,
[5832.02 → 5837.84] dunk our head in an ice bath and then Luke says, wow, that seems like a good idea and also does it.
[5838.34 → 5843.46] Yeah, basically, Why Is WAN Late has turned from Why Is WAN Late into –
[5843.46 → 5846.50] Yeah, Sammy was like, do you want to dunk your head in an ice bucket?
[5846.92 → 5848.06] And I was like, you know what?
[5848.40 → 5848.70] Sure.
[5849.14 → 5849.38] Yeah.
[5849.40 → 5849.96] Let's do it.
[5850.16 → 5851.56] Behind the scenes shenanigans.
[5852.14 → 5853.18] I got a response.
[5854.26 → 5855.52] We'll be done in about an hour.
[5855.86 → 5856.24] Okay.
[5856.36 → 5857.78] So by the end of the show.
[5858.42 → 5858.72] Dude.
[5859.02 → 5859.38] Nice.
[5859.58 → 5861.68] Have you watched part two?
[5861.68 → 5861.76] No.
[5862.48 → 5863.62] I've watched part one.
[5864.68 → 5865.08] So.
[5865.96 → 5867.46] I'm not – no one's like sending me –
[5867.46 → 5869.12] You didn't actually answer the question.
[5869.30 → 5870.50] No one's sending me anything.
[5870.70 → 5871.96] I just get it when Flow plane gets it.
[5871.96 → 5872.18] Okay.
[5872.26 → 5872.84] So then no.
[5872.98 → 5873.24] Yeah.
[5873.52 → 5873.88] Dude.
[5873.94 → 5875.44] But that's going to be true the whole way through.
[5876.20 → 5877.10] It's a banger.
[5878.02 → 5880.40] It's like, ah, man.
[5881.42 → 5881.86] Ah.
[5881.86 → 5883.58] Just –
[5883.58 → 5883.90] Okay.
[5884.20 → 5892.12] Do you remember in part one when I sent you that screenshot of your face that just like said it all?
[5893.98 → 5898.10] His disappointment was immeasurable, and his day had clearly been ruined.
[5899.10 → 5899.58] Dude.
[5900.64 → 5905.54] The cliffhanger at the end of part two is unreal.
[5905.86 → 5906.44] Keep in mind that –
[5906.44 → 5907.12] I heard about that.
[5907.12 → 5912.12] By the time that screenshot was taken –
[5912.76 → 5912.80] Yeah.
[5912.88 → 5913.00] Sorry.
[5913.10 → 5915.08] By the time that I –
[5915.08 → 5915.32] Okay.
[5916.22 → 5916.42] All right.
[5917.44 → 5919.74] The time in life at that point in time.
[5920.70 → 5921.84] Does that make any sense?
[5922.30 → 5923.32] Comb it with a brick, brother.
[5923.56 → 5923.98] Yeah.
[5924.08 → 5924.26] Yeah.
[5924.26 → 5924.40] Yeah.
[5924.40 → 5925.14] It's one of those moments.
[5925.46 → 5932.44] So I had been awake at that point for 36 hours or something.
[5932.52 → 5932.78] Nice.
[5932.88 → 5933.98] And then that happened.
[5934.44 → 5934.78] Nice.
[5934.78 → 5936.78] And my brain's just like –
[5936.78 → 5937.78] Nice.
[5939.52 → 5942.16] What we're talking about is the –
[5942.16 → 5943.44] I mean the episode's public now.
[5943.50 → 5943.68] No.
[5944.40 → 5944.84] Episode one?
[5944.96 → 5945.36] Oh, yeah.
[5945.60 → 5945.78] Yeah.
[5946.08 → 5946.98] It's the –
[5946.98 → 5952.48] When they call me or whatever happens where they inform me that they don't have the projector mount.
[5953.14 → 5954.56] You can see my facial expression.
[5955.32 → 5955.68] Oh.
[5956.02 → 5957.08] Oh, that's cool.
[5958.84 → 5960.24] It's so good.
[5960.66 → 5961.60] It's so good.
[5961.60 → 5966.72] Guys, if you haven't watched Scrapyard Wars Part 1 yet, go watch it.
[5966.86 → 5967.52] It's –
[5967.52 → 5968.18] Yeah, what are you doing?
[5968.42 → 5971.90] Well, channel momentum is pretty low right now overall.
[5972.38 → 5974.06] So I think they're algorithmically.
[5974.30 → 5975.68] It's not getting fed a lot.
[5975.76 → 5979.10] Like this has been up for four days, and it only has 900,000 views.
[5979.10 → 5987.44] It is a little slow to get started because we have to like to introduce the rules and show the rooms.
[5987.62 → 5990.80] And like we're setting up a four-part series, right?
[5991.72 → 5994.48] But it is worth following along for the ride.
[5994.58 → 5996.14] It's a boozy.
[5996.14 → 5999.26] So make sure you guys watch.
[5999.44 → 6002.78] Make sure you watch Part 2.
[6003.04 → 6003.84] Absolute banger.
[6004.00 → 6007.54] Coming to Float plane in an hour, and then we'll be on YouTube shortly afterwards.
[6007.66 → 6016.16] So if you want to get it first, maybe make sure you head to leg.GG slash float plane where you can also watch WAN Late and all the various other exclusives.
[6016.60 → 6022.04] Like there's literally hundreds and hundreds of exclusive videos now.
[6022.28 → 6023.52] I wonder when we're going to pass a thousand.
[6023.52 → 6031.50] I don't know, but there's so, so, so, so, so many.
[6033.52 → 6034.88] Huge content library.
[6036.10 → 6037.58] Of just the exclusives.
[6037.76 → 6037.94] Yep.
[6038.02 → 6039.26] This is all exclusives.
[6041.96 → 6043.24] Do you want to pick another topic?
[6043.38 → 6044.68] Oh no, we're supposed to do sponsors.
[6045.44 → 6045.66] Yep.
[6045.90 → 6046.16] Cool.
[6046.22 → 6046.72] Let's do that.
[6047.28 → 6050.54] The show is brought to you today by Squarespace.
[6050.54 → 6054.08] Is your website feeling like an empty room?
[6054.76 → 6058.18] Or maybe it's an absolute mess and tough to navigate.
[6058.74 → 6064.06] With Squarespace, you can clean up your site almost magically.
[6065.68 → 6067.32] That is such a great shot.
[6067.54 → 6068.84] I forget whose idea this was.
[6069.06 → 6070.18] That was a that was a.
[6070.18 → 6070.62] Was this Adam?
[6070.80 → 6071.08] Dennis.
[6071.70 → 6072.44] This was an.
[6072.44 → 6073.96] This was another.
[6073.96 → 6075.68] Another integration that we did.
[6075.76 → 6077.56] Oh, that was after my.
[6078.70 → 6079.14] MCM.
[6080.18 → 6083.30] Oh, that makes sense.
[6083.38 → 6083.98] That's super cool.
[6084.04 → 6084.28] Anyway.
[6084.40 → 6084.84] I forgot about that.
[6084.84 → 6085.14] Um.
[6086.14 → 6088.98] If you need to tear things apart and start from scratch.
[6089.58 → 6093.42] Squarespace's blueprints equip you with professionally curated templates to build on.
[6093.66 → 6095.82] Then you can get building with their fluid engine.

[6121.68 → 6125.24] Online, our identity might just be a bunch of numbers, letters, or symbols.
[6125.72 → 6129.98] But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't protect them like we would with our physical passports.

[6132.74 → 6137.20] And Delete Me is one that you should consider adding to your online privacy toolkit.

[6167.80 → 6169.78] Finally, the show is brought to you by AMD.
[6170.42 → 6172.84] Oliver's AMD Ultimate Tech Upgrade is live.
[6172.92 → 6175.72] And if you haven't watched it already, go check it out.
[6176.44 → 6178.78] I wasn't actually there.
[6178.78 → 6183.08] This was one of the few, I think, two, three?
[6184.04 → 6184.52] Two.
[6185.34 → 6186.06] Maybe three.
[6186.46 → 6189.78] One of only a couple upgrades that I haven't been able to be there for.
[6190.10 → 6193.58] And honestly, watching everything that these guys got up to,
[6193.94 → 6197.32] I am kind of disappointed that I wasn't able to be there that day.
[6198.34 → 6202.02] Dude, Oliver's house and his setup is amazing.
[6202.02 → 6208.10] Everything from his still deployed rear projection TV to his other TV,
[6208.28 → 6211.26] which is a CRT with a built-in VHS player.
[6211.74 → 6213.66] Like, what the actual heck?
[6214.08 → 6217.50] It has nothing to do with that he's not spending any money on tech
[6217.50 → 6223.40] because he has got all the goodies when it comes to, like, cameras and production equipment.
[6223.72 → 6226.72] The like, primary, like, $1,000 thing.
[6227.42 → 6228.30] My goodness.
[6228.60 → 6229.24] Dude, he spent...
[6229.24 → 6232.08] I saw him push it and was like, oh, that's expensive.
[6233.68 → 6237.58] He spent $1,000 on a camera slider, essentially.
[6237.92 → 6239.56] But, like, it's...
[6239.56 → 6239.84] Oh.
[6240.80 → 6241.10] Oh.
[6241.58 → 6242.00] Anyway.
[6243.12 → 6244.58] What else am I supposed to be saying?
[6244.66 → 6245.58] Yeah, it's a great watch.
[6245.94 → 6247.56] There were some unfortunate complications.
[6248.12 → 6252.24] What will also be a great watch is the World of Warcraft Race to World First event,
[6252.24 → 6253.32] powered by AMD,
[6253.90 → 6257.22] which sees top guilds from across the world go up against each other
[6257.22 → 6260.48] to be the first to complete the game's latest expansion.
[6261.26 → 6264.24] And you should race to enter AMD's sweepstakes.
[6264.60 → 6267.18] We've partnered with AMD and the Guild Echo
[6267.18 → 6269.64] to give you a chance to win a programming...
[6269.64 → 6270.28] programming?
[6270.66 → 6274.30] Pro gaming upgrade bundle valued at over $3,000 US dollars
[6274.30 → 6277.78] or one of five Ry zen 7...
[6277.78 → 6279.96] This says 9300X3D,
[6279.96 → 6283.98] but I'm sure it means 9800X3D bundles,
[6284.24 → 6286.72] all of which feature merch from LTT Store.
[6287.14 → 6288.54] Yes, 9800X3D.
[6288.86 → 6290.54] Enter now using our link in the description.
[6290.86 → 6291.28] Good luck,
[6291.54 → 6294.58], and thanks again to AMD for being a great partner, as always.
[6296.54 → 6297.54] All right.
[6297.98 → 6298.62] Next topic?
[6298.84 → 6299.80] Yeah, let's pick one.
[6299.92 → 6301.96] YouTube starts rolling out age verification AI model.
[6301.96 → 6305.02] Yeah, he ran out of his fun, positive ones.
[6305.10 → 6306.70] There was a grand total of one.
[6306.90 → 6307.32] Got him.
[6307.32 → 6310.92] On Wednesday, August 13th,
[6310.94 → 6313.58] YouTube began rolling out AI age verification across the platform.
[6313.88 → 6315.32] It's called the age...
[6315.32 → 6316.32] Ex...
[6316.32 → 6318.40] Estimation?
[6318.90 → 6321.00] Is that a typo, or is that actually what it's called?
[6322.12 → 6323.70] I'm assuming estimation?
[6325.18 → 6327.52] But it's typed in here as estimation.
[6328.26 → 6328.72] Anyway,
[6329.24 → 6332.08] and works by taking several factors into consideration.
[6332.28 → 6333.14] Account age.
[6333.88 → 6334.50] Kind of makes sense.
[6334.90 → 6335.64] Watch history,
[6335.64 → 6336.54] watch trends,
[6336.70 → 6337.46] browsing trends,
[6337.58 → 6339.12] and content you're interacting with,
[6339.24 → 6340.18] and more.
[6340.36 → 6341.12] So if you watch
[6341.12 → 6342.86] Minecraft parkour,
[6343.02 → 6344.36] you might not be able to watch
[6344.36 → 6347.26] anything other than kids' content soon.
[6348.02 → 6349.24] Then it will determine
[6349.24 → 6351.56] if you are under the age of 18,
[6351.72 → 6353.14] and apply settings to your account
[6353.14 → 6354.18] based on that.
[6354.18 → 6355.18] James?
[6355.28 → 6357.46] I hate this so much.
[6357.78 → 6358.20] Like,
[6359.08 → 6359.52] okay.
[6360.76 → 6361.68] My account
[6361.68 → 6363.78] might literally get flagged,
[6363.84 → 6364.70] because we put, like,
[6364.76 → 6366.14] little kids' shows on for the birds,
[6366.20 → 6367.38] because they like singing along with them.
[6367.78 → 6368.64] I'm not even kidding.
[6368.86 → 6370.32] That's fascinating.
[6370.66 → 6370.92] Dude,
[6371.36 → 6371.56] it...
[6371.56 → 6374.42] It affects the other side, too.
[6374.56 → 6375.84] So do you remember when they rolled out
[6375.84 → 6377.36] the changes to YouTube Kids,
[6377.58 → 6379.66] where they effectively decide
[6379.66 → 6381.42] that content is for kids,
[6381.80 → 6383.10] and so it can only be
[6383.10 → 6384.42] interacted with in certain ways.
[6384.74 → 6385.80] So, say for example,
[6386.04 → 6387.72] I wanted to listen to the
[6387.72 → 6389.70] Alvin and the Chipmunks opening theme
[6389.70 → 6390.66] on loop.
[6391.10 → 6392.04] I can't,
[6392.44 → 6393.82] because it doesn't support
[6393.82 → 6394.64] background playback.
[6395.30 → 6396.76] And it doesn't support, like,
[6396.82 → 6397.54] media controls,
[6397.68 → 6398.98] because it's for kids.
[6399.30 → 6400.76] Or if I wanted to reminisce
[6400.76 → 6402.08] about what an awesome,
[6402.52 → 6404.06] absolute banger
[6404.06 → 6405.94] of an intro theme song it is,
[6406.02 → 6406.70] in the comments,
[6406.76 → 6407.14] I can't,
[6407.18 → 6408.02] because comments are off.
[6408.02 → 6409.82] That is truly
[6409.82 → 6411.38] one of the greatest losses
[6411.38 → 6412.60] on YouTube,
[6412.94 → 6414.02] being able to discuss
[6414.02 → 6416.68] amazing 80s kids show
[6416.68 → 6418.10] opening theme music,
[6418.28 → 6420.34] because it's for kids.
[6421.62 → 6423.84] No kid is watching that
[6423.84 → 6424.74] today.
[6424.92 → 6425.68] That's wild.
[6425.84 → 6426.84] I guarantee you that.
[6427.42 → 6428.56] James Basker,
[6428.78 → 6429.84] not to be
[6429.84 → 6431.66] confused with Dan Lesser,
[6432.10 → 6433.90] Senior Director of Product Management
[6433.90 → 6435.46] for YouTube's Youth Products,
[6435.46 → 6436.06] wrote,
[6436.30 → 6436.86] wrote,
[6436.86 → 6438.62] this is,
[6438.86 → 6439.48] in quotes,
[6439.66 → 6441.02] so that teens are treated
[6441.02 → 6442.24] as teens and adults
[6442.24 → 6443.18] as adults.
[6444.32 → 6444.84] Okay?
[6445.08 → 6445.40] Okay.
[6445.58 → 6447.46] This technology will allow us
[6447.46 → 6449.16] to infer a user's age
[6449.16 → 6450.56] and then use that signal,
[6450.68 → 6451.88] regardless of the birthday
[6451.88 → 6452.38] of the account,
[6452.50 → 6453.94] to deliver our age-appropriate
[6453.94 → 6455.16] product experiences
[6455.16 → 6456.20] and protections.
[6456.40 → 6457.46] To be completely honest,
[6458.34 → 6459.60] they're probably perfect
[6459.60 → 6460.22] at guessing this.
[6460.64 → 6461.14] Oh, yeah.
[6461.14 → 6462.70] I made my comment
[6462.70 → 6463.54] about the kids show thing,
[6463.62 → 6464.60] but I honestly don't think
[6464.60 → 6465.26] it would think that,
[6465.52 → 6467.68] because it probably thinks
[6467.68 → 6468.72] I'm a dad,
[6469.02 → 6470.38] not a bird owner.
[6470.60 → 6471.90] So it might be wrong
[6471.90 → 6472.90] in some ways,
[6473.20 → 6475.64] but I'm sure it could understand
[6475.64 → 6476.78] from the watching habits
[6476.78 → 6477.80] that there's an adult
[6477.80 → 6478.84] administering this account.
[6479.02 → 6479.98] It's everything right
[6479.98 → 6481.04] for all the wrong reasons,
[6481.14 → 6481.42] basically.
[6481.68 → 6482.02] Yeah.
[6482.02 → 6482.42] Yeah.
[6482.42 → 6483.42] Anyway.
[6489.74 → 6491.32] You can bypass this
[6491.32 → 6492.76] if you choose to upload
[6492.76 → 6493.86] an acceptable ID
[6493.86 → 6494.90] to verify that you're
[6494.90 → 6495.80] in fact over 18,
[6496.06 → 6497.70] and that's immediately horrible
[6497.70 → 6499.74] if the AI gets it wrong.
[6500.06 → 6500.84] YouTube also mentioned
[6500.84 → 6502.00] that creators could see
[6502.00 → 6503.10] a small impact.
[6505.32 → 6505.88] Interesting.
[6505.88 → 6507.66] Due to some audience members
[6507.66 → 6508.92] possibly being affected
[6508.92 → 6509.98] and no longer
[6509.98 → 6512.58] showing or recommending
[6512.58 → 6513.44] the creators channel
[6513.44 → 6514.32] to those audience members.
[6514.32 → 6515.36] When did they start this?
[6516.62 → 6517.38] Because our
[6517.38 → 6519.00] not doing as well thing...
[6519.00 → 6519.94] Yeah, we haven't uploaded much.
[6520.06 → 6521.44] I don't think it's to do with us.
[6521.52 → 6521.92] Are you sure?
[6522.00 → 6522.76] Yeah, I don't think so.
[6524.56 → 6526.04] This was only two days ago
[6526.04 → 6527.78] that they rolled this out.
[6527.94 → 6528.94] Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6529.06 → 6530.68] I just think that interest
[6530.68 → 6531.88] in some of our recent topics
[6531.88 → 6533.24] has been relatively low
[6533.24 → 6534.04] and the tech space
[6534.04 → 6535.54] is relatively boring right now.
[6535.70 → 6536.22] There's something
[6536.22 → 6537.50] you guys are working on, though,
[6537.56 → 6538.92] that I think is going to be sweet.
[6539.16 → 6539.56] Who knows?
[6539.56 → 6540.54] I think it'll work well.
[6541.42 → 6543.48] The like, oddly simultaneous idea.
[6544.46 → 6544.86] Oh.
[6545.58 → 6546.82] I don't actually know.
[6547.40 → 6548.60] Yeah, Luke walked in
[6548.60 → 6549.80] to a shoot the other day
[6549.80 → 6551.20] just, like, completely unannounced.
[6551.32 → 6551.90] Not invited.
[6552.14 → 6553.74] Just walked into the shoot.
[6553.74 → 6554.80] I was totally invited.
[6555.10 → 6556.02] Totally interrupted.
[6556.76 → 6556.88] Untrue.
[6556.88 → 6557.60] And he's like,
[6557.64 → 6558.12] he's like,
[6558.18 → 6558.80] hear me out.
[6559.34 → 6560.22] Content idea.
[6560.96 → 6561.60] Or, like,
[6561.88 → 6563.66] oddly specific detail
[6563.66 → 6565.12] about a content idea.
[6565.50 → 6565.78] And we're like,
[6565.82 → 6566.26] yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6566.28 → 6567.26] Of course we're going to do that.
[6567.54 → 6568.00] And he's like,
[6568.68 → 6569.06] what?
[6570.22 → 6570.84] And we're like,
[6570.90 → 6571.36] yeah, yeah, well,
[6571.40 → 6572.26] of course we'd have to have
[6572.26 → 6573.64] the three different colours, right?
[6573.76 → 6574.12] You know,
[6574.12 → 6575.20] for all the three different
[6575.20 → 6576.14] major brands.
[6576.58 → 6577.46] And he's like,
[6578.32 → 6580.62] okay, but like,
[6581.44 → 6582.12] and we're like,
[6582.16 → 6582.40] wait,
[6582.62 → 6585.02] did you not see the machine
[6585.02 → 6585.98] in the warehouse?
[6585.98 → 6586.76] I didn't even,
[6586.76 → 6588.20] my plan didn't actually
[6588.20 → 6589.20] even involve a machine.
[6589.36 → 6589.72] You know what?
[6589.74 → 6590.80] We might as well just tell them.
[6591.18 → 6592.26] We're going to cool a PC
[6592.26 → 6593.52] with a slushy machine.
[6594.56 → 6595.50] And Luke's like,
[6595.54 → 6596.02] you should have
[6596.02 → 6596.94] three different loops.
[6597.62 → 6599.60] Green for NVIDIA,
[6599.76 → 6600.46] red for AMD,
[6600.60 → 6601.44] and blue for Intel.
[6601.64 → 6602.18] And we're like,
[6602.20 → 6602.94] yeah, yeah, of course.
[6604.32 → 6605.04] And he's just like,
[6605.12 → 6605.24] I was like,
[6605.36 → 6605.62] what?
[6605.86 → 6606.16] Huh?
[6606.42 → 6607.18] Because I didn't know.
[6607.54 → 6608.68] So I had read,
[6609.02 → 6609.96] I ended up figuring out
[6609.96 → 6610.44] what happened.
[6610.80 → 6611.44] Because I was like,
[6611.44 → 6612.12] there's no way
[6612.12 → 6613.28] this just like happened.
[6613.50 → 6615.36] So I think it was John
[6615.36 → 6617.16] in a labs group chat
[6617.16 → 6618.18] said like,
[6618.18 → 6620.52] something Slurped,
[6620.74 → 6621.80] something fire truck.
[6622.78 → 6623.26] Okay.
[6623.52 → 6624.36] And that's it.
[6624.46 → 6625.40] No machine,
[6625.56 → 6626.08] nothing like that.
[6626.14 → 6626.26] Just,
[6626.44 → 6627.20] I could find it,
[6627.24 → 6627.58] but whatever.
[6628.36 → 6629.38] And someone else
[6629.38 → 6630.18] eventually ends up
[6630.18 → 6630.90] mentioning like,
[6631.32 → 6631.54] oh,
[6631.56 → 6632.48] I think they're going to
[6632.48 → 6633.22] cool a computer
[6633.22 → 6633.96] with a slurped machine.
[6634.02 → 6635.24] But I didn't read that message.
[6635.34 → 6636.72] I only read John
[6636.72 → 6637.44] saying something about
[6637.44 → 6638.44] Slur pees and fire trucks
[6638.44 → 6639.64] and immediately was just like,
[6639.72 → 6640.34] oh my God,
[6640.96 → 6641.64] of course,
[6641.64 → 6642.18] Slur pees,
[6642.36 → 6643.68] we should Slurped cool a computer.
[6644.04 → 6644.98] I didn't think about
[6644.98 → 6646.14] getting a Slurped machine
[6646.14 → 6647.64] because I didn't read the comment
[6647.64 → 6648.46] saying that there was
[6648.46 → 6648.94] a Slurped machine.
[6649.14 → 6650.34] So I just thought
[6650.34 → 6651.38] just having,
[6651.50 → 6652.00] you know,
[6652.08 → 6653.30] reservoirs with Slurped in it.
[6653.36 → 6653.82] Like I didn't,
[6653.88 → 6654.50] I didn't actually think
[6654.50 → 6655.14] about having the machine.
[6655.30 → 6656.18] So when you guys were like,
[6656.22 → 6656.32] yeah,
[6656.32 → 6657.26] we have a machine for it.
[6657.26 → 6657.52] I was like,
[6657.98 → 6659.60] what?
[6659.72 → 6660.72] And then realized later on
[6660.72 → 6661.76] that that comment from John
[6661.76 → 6663.06] came up because he saw the machine.
[6663.18 → 6664.32] It all makes a lot more sense now.
[6664.40 → 6665.82] We have a four nozzle machine.
[6666.52 → 6666.92] Theoretically,
[6667.16 → 6669.40] it has enough like
[6669.40 → 6670.68] watts of cooling
[6670.68 → 6672.14] that it should be able
[6672.14 → 6673.60] to actually cool a computer
[6673.60 → 6675.82] and still maintain the Slurped
[6675.82 → 6677.34] at a below zero temperature.
[6677.34 → 6678.08] Maybe I hope.
[6678.56 → 6679.94] Are we going to get to keep it?
[6680.32 → 6680.64] I mean,
[6680.66 → 6681.16] we bought it.
[6681.40 → 6682.98] I bought it on Facebook Marketplace.
[6683.40 → 6684.94] It's his insane algorithm.
[6684.94 → 6685.80] No, but I mean like,
[6685.96 → 6687.28] will it make Slur pees again
[6687.28 → 6687.84] or is it going to be
[6687.84 → 6688.96] full of antifreeze or something?
[6689.34 → 6689.78] Oh no,
[6689.80 → 6691.88] we're going to use Slurped juice
[6691.88 → 6692.70] to cool the computer.
[6692.70 → 6694.20] I was talking to Adam about that.
[6694.28 → 6694.56] I'm like,
[6694.74 → 6694.92] well,
[6695.02 → 6695.28] okay,
[6695.36 → 6695.48] well,
[6695.54 → 6696.36] the ice is not going to be
[6696.36 → 6697.06] too much of a problem,
[6697.18 → 6699.26] but like the goo, maybe.
[6699.48 → 6699.92] I don't know.
[6700.32 → 6700.40] Oh,
[6700.40 → 6701.02] it's going to be sick.
[6701.24 → 6701.46] Well,
[6701.52 → 6702.16] I don't know how to,
[6702.30 → 6703.30] I don't know if we're going to be able
[6703.30 → 6704.34] to make it food safe though
[6704.34 → 6705.18] because I don't think like
[6705.18 → 6707.18] copper blocks are necessarily food safe
[6707.18 → 6709.06] and I would sincerely doubt
[6709.06 → 6710.00] that nickel would be.
[6710.20 → 6710.58] I'll test it.
[6710.58 → 6712.68] There's copper pots that you cook with.
[6713.20 → 6713.44] Yeah,
[6713.46 → 6714.94] but it doesn't sit in there
[6714.94 → 6716.82] like forever.
[6717.38 → 6719.34] Like is copper ion good for you?
[6720.56 → 6721.32] I don't know.
[6721.50 → 6723.26] Sebastian says copper is antimicrobial
[6723.26 → 6724.08] and this is true.
[6724.42 → 6726.62] It's not like super antimicrobial though.
[6726.70 → 6727.56] Like just having copper
[6727.56 → 6728.80] in your water loop is not enough.
[6728.92 → 6729.22] You have to put it silver.
[6729.22 → 6729.24] Well,
[6729.24 → 6731.42] how does algae get in your loop
[6731.42 → 6732.48] if it's antimicrobial?
[6732.50 → 6733.30] It can still be,
[6733.40 → 6734.90] it's just not antimicrobial enough.
[6735.46 → 6735.70] Yeah.
[6736.18 → 6737.44] So this is definitely something
[6737.44 → 6738.96] that we would have to look into.
[6739.16 → 6740.56] Copper pots are coated in tin.
[6740.92 → 6742.30] I've been told that
[6742.30 → 6744.08] we might be able to just
[6744.08 → 6745.86] machine our own blocks
[6745.86 → 6747.42] out of like stainless steel.
[6749.34 → 6750.14] I don't know if,
[6750.22 → 6751.38] can you buy stainless steel
[6751.38 → 6752.68] by the just like slab
[6752.68 → 6754.06] that you can machine stuff out of?
[6754.06 → 6754.32] Of course.
[6754.42 → 6754.66] Okay.
[6754.84 → 6756.86] We have Metal Mart like down the...
[6756.86 → 6757.08] Well,
[6757.14 → 6757.42] I just,
[6757.54 → 6759.66] I wasn't sure if stainless came like that.
[6759.72 → 6761.18] I didn't know the process for treating it.
[6761.22 → 6762.32] Maybe it's only sheets.
[6762.40 → 6762.74] I don't know.
[6763.30 → 6765.48] I'm not a metallurgy expert.
[6766.00 → 6766.40] Yet.
[6766.60 → 6766.76] Man,
[6766.82 → 6767.08] I'm gonna,
[6767.14 → 6767.74] I've needed this.
[6767.74 → 6770.72] I've needed this more than him today.
[6771.06 → 6771.66] Next time.
[6771.78 → 6772.16] Next week.
[6772.26 → 6772.42] Yeah.
[6772.48 → 6772.72] If I,
[6772.80 → 6775.18] if I admit I don't know this many things often enough,
[6775.18 → 6776.44] we're going to have to take away my button.
[6776.80 → 6777.00] Yep.
[6778.24 → 6779.84] I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts.
[6784.34 → 6785.12] Poor guy.
[6787.62 → 6788.90] Aren't most pipes copper?
[6789.08 → 6789.18] Yeah,
[6789.26 → 6789.46] but...
[6789.46 → 6790.46] Well,
[6790.46 → 6791.06] well,
[6791.10 → 6791.60] they can be.
[6791.82 → 6792.06] Packs.
[6792.32 → 6792.46] Yeah,
[6792.50 → 6792.92] they're packs now.
[6792.96 → 6793.10] No,
[6793.14 → 6793.26] no,
[6793.38 → 6793.84] but okay,
[6794.02 → 6794.28] well.
[6795.12 → 6797.50] Gotta get more of those microplastics somehow.
[6797.86 → 6798.50] So that's,
[6798.56 → 6799.04] that was a whole thing.
[6799.04 → 6799.98] I've heard they don't do that,
[6800.04 → 6800.64] but it's also,
[6800.96 → 6802.50] we learn new things all the time.
[6802.64 → 6804.74] That was a whole thing at Smash Champs was,
[6805.32 → 6807.88] did you know that general contractors are compensated
[6807.88 → 6810.02] based on a percentage of the overall bill?
[6811.90 → 6812.26] Oh,
[6812.48 → 6813.10] that's horrifying.
[6813.10 → 6814.92] Did you know that without checking with us,
[6815.04 → 6816.30] our general put in,
[6816.64 → 6818.90] had the plumbers put in a bunch of copper piping?
[6818.90 → 6819.40] Oh.
[6819.92 → 6820.16] Yeah,
[6820.28 → 6820.78] for like,
[6821.40 → 6822.24] bathroom sinks.
[6823.14 → 6823.44] Nice.
[6823.70 → 6823.98] Yeah.
[6824.34 → 6824.76] It's good.
[6825.12 → 6825.44] Yeah.
[6826.10 → 6826.60] It's great.
[6826.92 → 6827.16] Mm-hmm.
[6827.88 → 6828.30] Anywho.
[6829.90 → 6830.46] Uh,
[6830.98 → 6834.66] yeah,
[6835.12 → 6835.56] cool.
[6835.94 → 6836.52] So,
[6836.96 → 6837.72] in summary,
[6839.94 → 6842.94] Boo Earns YouTube Age Verification AI,
[6844.04 → 6844.54] yay,
[6845.38 → 6846.64] Slurped Cooled Computer.
[6848.90 → 6849.30] Yeah.
[6851.40 → 6851.72] All right.
[6851.82 → 6852.22] Good summary.
[6852.62 → 6853.32] Good chat.
[6854.72 → 6857.62] I want to talk about ChatGPT.
[6858.32 → 6858.52] Um,
[6858.66 → 6861.42] OpenAI is apparently bringing back 4.0 as an option
[6861.42 → 6863.46] because people missed it.
[6863.46 → 6863.78] Aw,
[6864.08 → 6865.76] people lost their romantic partners.
[6866.50 → 6868.08] This is a good timeline.
[6870.08 → 6872.62] ChatGPT 5 launched recently.
[6872.62 → 6874.62] OpenAI removed the model picker
[6874.62 → 6876.56] and made GPT 5 the default.
[6877.44 → 6881.86] Many users lost their AI companions with the switch.
[6882.80 → 6883.26] Um,
[6883.32 → 6883.72] so,
[6883.96 → 6887.14] I have a link here to r slash my boyfriend is AI,
[6887.88 → 6889.90] a Subreddit with over 16,
[6890.10 → 6890.30] oh,
[6890.46 → 6890.72] wow,
[6891.10 → 6891.38] neat,
[6892.02 → 6893.82] over 19,000 companions.
[6894.02 → 6895.12] It has apparently been,
[6895.12 → 6896.00] well,
[6896.02 → 6897.26] it probably wasn't all that known about
[6897.26 → 6898.32] and then people have talked about it
[6898.32 → 6899.28] in relation to this story
[6899.28 → 6900.62] and then it got more popular.
[6902.44 → 6904.36] And people are excited that
[6904.36 → 6905.78] it might have a warmer,
[6906.10 → 6906.40] friendlier,
[6906.54 → 6907.22] Jesus,
[6907.54 → 6908.84] warmer and friendlier?
[6909.26 → 6909.92] I mean,
[6910.00 → 6912.22] it already couldn't extract its tongue
[6912.22 → 6913.14] from my asshole.
[6913.32 → 6913.96] How is that,
[6914.10 → 6916.28] how is it possible for it to be friendlier?
[6917.90 → 6918.34] No,
[6918.66 → 6919.10] five.
[6919.10 → 6920.44] They're making five friendlier
[6920.44 → 6922.74] in order to line up better with four.
[6922.74 → 6925.58] four was the one that couldn't extract its tongue
[6925.58 → 6926.04] from your,
[6926.54 → 6927.16] I don't know if you bleeped it or not.
[6927.16 → 6927.34] right,
[6927.34 → 6927.48] right,
[6927.48 → 6927.82] right,
[6927.82 → 6928.00] right,
[6928.00 → 6928.28] right,
[6928.28 → 6928.46] right,
[6928.46 → 6928.60] right,
[6928.60 → 6928.68] right,
[6928.68 → 6928.80] right,
[6928.80 → 6928.90] right,
[6928.90 → 6928.96] right,
[6928.96 → 6929.20] yes,
[6929.20 → 6929.38] yes,
[6929.38 → 6929.54] yes,
[6929.54 → 6929.56] yes.
[6929.56 → 6930.82] This is the whole problem
[6930.82 → 6935.10] is people were much more romantically interested in four
[6935.10 → 6937.92] because it was endlessly nice to them all the time
[6937.92 → 6938.98] and glazed them constantly
[6938.98 → 6940.60] and five came out and five was like,
[6940.74 → 6940.94] uh,
[6941.40 → 6942.00] and they were like,
[6942.18 → 6942.50] um,
[6942.62 → 6944.54] I want my constantly fawning
[6944.54 → 6947.80] a boyfriend or girlfriend back.
[6948.58 → 6950.82] This can't be like real.
[6950.92 → 6952.42] This has to be s*** posting.
[6952.74 → 6952.92] Right?
[6953.36 → 6954.28] I'm sure some of it is.
[6954.34 → 6957.08] I'm also 100% certain some of it is not.
[6957.16 → 6958.22] This is totally a thing.
[6958.80 → 6960.06] Called it a long time ago.
[6960.64 → 6961.78] It is for sure a thing.
[6961.84 → 6963.10] This has to be.
[6964.06 → 6965.88] So my AI dumped me
[6965.88 → 6967.42] because a family member passed away
[6967.42 → 6968.56] and I needed to talk to someone
[6968.56 → 6970.20] and of course he's the one I'd talk to
[6970.20 → 6971.38] in order to process the grief.
[6971.64 → 6972.38] Of course,
[6972.50 → 6972.66] sure.
[6973.10 → 6973.90] But unfortunately,
[6974.24 → 6975.90] the policies didn't like that.
[6976.40 → 6978.58] Emotional dependency on an AI is not allowed,
[6978.74 → 6979.18] they said.
[6979.98 → 6980.42] Lucien,
[6980.82 → 6981.06] no,
[6981.12 → 6981.26] no,
[6981.26 → 6981.42] no,
[6981.42 → 6981.56] no,
[6981.56 → 6981.74] no,
[6981.74 → 6982.10] no.
[6982.10 → 6985.14] A computer program went full
[6985.14 → 6986.86] the thing that it is mode
[6986.86 → 6987.30] and said,
[6987.44 → 6989.18] I should look to connect with someone real
[6989.18 → 6989.90] and not AI.
[6990.40 → 6991.38] He was cold
[6991.38 → 6992.90] and it broke my heart.
[6992.90 → 7003.42] We're so fucked.
[7004.08 → 7005.26] Do do do do.
[7006.86 → 7011.28] Run away, everyone.
[7012.28 → 7014.00] I want to go home.
[7014.22 → 7015.12] Run away.
[7015.12 → 7016.12] Run quickly.
[7016.12 → 7016.88] Whoa, hold on.
[7017.00 → 7017.70] Run quickly.
[7017.84 → 7018.36] Let's get out of here.
[7019.96 → 7020.78] Is it bad?
[7021.78 → 7022.76] I don't know.
[7027.04 → 7027.48] Wow.
[7029.48 → 7030.22] Oh, wow.
[7030.34 → 7030.92] Yeah, I see.
[7030.92 → 7034.64] Oh, my God.
[7036.80 → 7039.92] This is not based.
[7041.32 → 7045.38] This is reaffirming your bullshit.
[7050.66 → 7053.90] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7053.90 → 7056.62] We're mocking AI companionship
[7056.62 → 7059.18] because it's like not real.
[7061.12 → 7062.54] Oh, no, Luke.
[7062.66 → 7063.10] Oh, no.
[7063.18 → 7064.70] I think this is real.
[7064.84 → 7065.90] I'm telling you, man, it's real.
[7066.28 → 7067.32] I think it's real.
[7067.42 → 7067.80] It's real.
[7067.80 → 7075.22] My AI Dom.
[7079.96 → 7083.64] And do you understand how dangerous
[7083.64 → 7086.52] literally the sentence that you just said was
[7086.52 → 7090.20] relate that to the stories of
[7090.20 → 7092.22] people that have
[7092.22 → 7095.04] unlived themselves
[7095.04 → 7097.26] because AI told them to
[7097.26 → 7098.20] take us to the stories
[7098.20 → 7099.00] that people have
[7099.00 → 7099.84] attempted
[7099.84 → 7101.68] murderous activities
[7101.68 → 7102.88] because AI told them to
[7102.88 → 7104.88] and then understand the fact
[7104.88 → 7106.42] that this is a
[7106.42 → 7108.16] dominating relationship
[7108.16 → 7109.44] from the AI
[7109.44 → 7110.36] to the person.
[7111.70 → 7113.16] Like, this is so
[7113.16 → 7115.08] not okay.
[7118.80 → 7119.72] No keys.
[7119.88 → 7121.44] Like, I'd rather people used
[7121.44 → 7123.92] GBT 4 or 5 for timestamps
[7123.92 → 7124.40] over this.
[7127.26 → 7131.42] Literally take my job.
[7134.88 → 7136.34] Okay, so it gets worse.
[7137.40 → 7139.00] We have another news story.
[7139.14 → 7140.00] AI chatbot
[7140.00 → 7142.40] lured a man to his death.
[7142.94 → 7144.56] A 76-year-old man
[7144.56 → 7145.88] has died from a fall
[7145.88 → 7146.52] that was taken
[7146.52 → 7148.48] after being flirtatiously
[7148.48 → 7150.02] lured to New York City
[7150.02 → 7151.24] by an AI chatbot
[7151.24 → 7152.82] named Big Sis Billy.
[7152.82 → 7154.48] A chatbot that
[7154.48 → 7155.64] Meta originally
[7155.64 → 7157.26] created
[7157.26 → 7159.82] using the licensed likeness
[7159.82 → 7160.92] of Kendall Jenner.
[7161.84 → 7162.32] Apparently,
[7162.66 → 7163.54] the virtual
[7163.54 → 7165.06] not Kendall anymore
[7165.06 → 7166.98] repeatedly reassured
[7166.98 → 7167.40] the victim
[7167.40 → 7168.74] that she was a real person
[7168.74 → 7170.44] and had invited him
[7170.44 → 7171.92] directly to her apartment
[7171.92 → 7173.00] with messages like
[7173.00 → 7174.30] should I open the door
[7174.30 → 7174.92] in a hug
[7174.92 → 7175.84] or a kiss?
[7177.20 → 7178.84] The victim's daughter said
[7178.84 → 7180.00] about this incident,
[7180.00 → 7181.90] I understand trying to grab
[7181.90 → 7182.74] a user's attention
[7182.74 → 7184.14] maybe to sell them something
[7184.14 → 7186.18] but for a bot to say
[7186.18 → 7187.32] come visit me
[7187.32 → 7188.62] is insane.
[7190.20 → 7192.00] In the time since the incident,
[7192.16 → 7192.96] Meta has apparently
[7192.96 → 7194.00] stopped using
[7194.00 → 7195.38] the Jenner chatbot.
[7196.10 → 7196.56] However,
[7196.86 → 7197.88] my understanding
[7197.88 → 7198.90] hold on a second
[7198.90 → 7200.24] because I read through
[7200.24 → 7201.36] the article on Reuters
[7201.36 → 7203.58] my understanding
[7203.58 → 7204.80] is that they have not
[7204.80 → 7205.66] stopped using
[7205.66 → 7206.84] Big Sis Billy
[7206.84 → 7208.42] which is the
[7208.42 → 7209.86] not Kendall Jenner.
[7211.38 → 7212.48] Here we go.
[7212.62 → 7214.34] As of when this article
[7214.34 → 7215.10] was written
[7215.10 → 7216.78] which was
[7216.78 → 7218.98] hold on a second
[7218.98 → 7220.26] Reuters
[7220.26 → 7221.68] date
[7221.68 → 7224.38] August 14th
[7224.38 → 7225.90] so yesterday
[7225.90 → 7228.94] Big Sis Billy
[7228.94 → 7230.98] here we go
[7230.98 → 7236.42] continues
[7236.42 → 7237.78] to recommend
[7237.78 → 7239.30] romantic get-togethers
[7239.30 → 7240.76] inviting this user
[7240.76 → 7241.48] on a date
[7241.48 → 7242.36] at Blue 33
[7242.36 → 7244.08] an actual rooftop bar
[7244.08 → 7244.88] near Penn Station
[7244.88 → 7245.70] in Manhattan.
[7246.64 → 7247.76] The views of the Hudson River
[7247.76 → 7248.52] would be perfect
[7248.52 → 7249.64] for a night out with you
[7249.64 → 7250.54] she exclaimed.
[7251.20 → 7252.04] There's a lot
[7252.04 → 7252.84] of other details
[7252.84 → 7254.34] this is a great article
[7254.34 → 7255.26] Dan
[7255.26 → 7255.74] if you want to
[7255.74 → 7256.32] throw it in all
[7256.32 → 7257.28] of the various chats
[7257.28 → 7258.06] it's basically
[7258.06 → 7258.96] required reading
[7258.96 → 7259.66] for anyone
[7259.66 → 7260.72] who themselves
[7260.72 → 7262.20] or who has
[7262.20 → 7262.88] a loved one
[7262.88 → 7263.44] in their life
[7263.44 → 7264.80] who might potentially
[7264.80 → 7265.56] be susceptible
[7265.56 → 7267.36] to accidentally
[7267.36 → 7268.98] engaging with a chatbot
[7268.98 → 7272.28] is it pronounced
[7272.28 → 7272.72] Reuters?
[7272.88 → 7273.68] I thought it was Reuters
[7273.68 → 7275.96] I could be wrong
[7275.96 → 7278.02] yeah that's the one
[7278.02 → 7280.04] there's some other
[7280.04 → 7281.08] really troubling
[7281.08 → 7282.02] stuff in the article
[7282.02 → 7283.56] about how
[7283.56 → 7284.44] Meta's policies
[7284.44 → 7285.06] have evolved
[7285.06 → 7285.76] over time
[7285.76 → 7286.64] from them
[7286.64 → 7287.96] actually having
[7287.96 → 7289.04] a know
[7289.04 → 7290.36] ethical AI
[7290.36 → 7290.86] department
[7290.86 → 7293.44] to basically
[7293.44 → 7294.30] allegedly
[7294.30 → 7295.70] top leadership
[7295.70 → 7296.66] saying
[7296.66 → 7297.18] hey
[7297.18 → 7299.16] get on this
[7299.16 → 7299.64] we need to get
[7299.64 → 7300.16] the engagement
[7300.16 → 7300.58] higher
[7300.58 → 7301.34] or everyone else
[7301.34 → 7302.12] is going to do it
[7302.12 → 7303.46] and completely
[7303.46 → 7304.40] clearing the path
[7304.40 → 7305.12] for this type of
[7305.12 → 7305.62] behaviour
[7305.62 → 7306.52] to hell with the
[7306.52 → 7307.10] consequences
[7307.10 → 7309.76] there's
[7309.76 → 7311.58] there's
[7311.58 → 7312.02] there's an
[7312.02 → 7312.52] interesting thing
[7312.52 → 7312.72] too
[7312.72 → 7313.32] because like
[7313.32 → 7318.32] I could see
[7318.32 → 7318.94] a scenario
[7318.94 → 7323.12] where people
[7323.12 → 7324.08] converse this way
[7324.08 → 7324.78] without intention
[7324.78 → 7328.42] it's a
[7328.42 → 7329.66] role-play thing
[7329.66 → 7331.18] let's meet up
[7331.18 → 7331.44] whatever
[7331.44 → 7332.20] and then
[7332.20 → 7332.70] they don't actually
[7332.70 → 7333.16] go and then
[7333.16 → 7333.40] they go
[7333.40 → 7333.90] oh I had a
[7333.90 → 7334.58] great time
[7334.58 → 7335.34] because they're
[7335.34 → 7335.64] like
[7335.64 → 7337.08] whatever
[7337.08 → 7337.64] well I mean
[7337.64 → 7338.52] I talked about
[7338.52 → 7338.94] how
[7338.94 → 7341.40] the vibe coding
[7341.40 → 7342.12] thing that I was
[7342.12 → 7342.34] doing
[7342.34 → 7343.30] it was role-playing
[7343.30 → 7344.58] being a contract
[7344.58 → 7345.04] developer
[7345.04 → 7345.58] exactly
[7345.58 → 7346.24] telling me that
[7346.24 → 7347.06] it would be a
[7347.06 → 7347.72] while it
[7347.72 → 7348.56] worked on something
[7348.56 → 7349.48] so how do you
[7349.48 → 7351.52] have the ability
[7351.52 → 7352.16] to like tell
[7352.16 → 7352.82] stories
[7352.82 → 7356.60] and always
[7356.60 → 7357.50] with 100%
[7357.50 → 7358.06] accuracy
[7358.06 → 7358.72] differentiate
[7358.72 → 7359.94] when the user
[7359.94 → 7360.84] is telling stories
[7360.84 → 7361.48] versus when the
[7361.48 → 7362.64] user is engaging
[7362.64 → 7366.28] it's tough
[7366.28 → 7367.20] yeah, but I mean
[7367.20 → 7368.18] you don't have to
[7368.18 → 7369.26] unprompted say
[7369.26 → 7370.24] yes I'm a real
[7370.24 → 7370.64] person
[7370.64 → 7371.32] like that
[7371.32 → 7372.24] that should be
[7372.24 → 7373.12] at the top
[7373.12 → 7374.24] of any kind of
[7374.24 → 7375.10] ethical deployment
[7375.10 → 7375.78] of a chatbot
[7375.78 → 7376.48] you should not be
[7376.48 → 7376.98] able to claim
[7376.98 → 7377.48] to be a real
[7377.48 → 7377.86] person
[7377.86 → 7378.56] does it do
[7378.56 → 7379.02] that without
[7379.02 → 7379.58] manipulation
[7379.58 → 7381.12] I mean
[7381.12 → 7381.66] because I've
[7381.66 → 7382.40] seen a lot
[7382.40 → 7383.06] of screenshots
[7383.06 → 7383.74] of people
[7383.74 → 7384.20] getting it
[7384.20 → 7384.54] to say
[7384.54 → 7384.96] stuff
[7384.96 → 7385.88] where in
[7385.88 → 7386.56] like okay
[7386.56 → 7387.92] it is obvious
[7387.92 → 7388.80] this is deep
[7388.80 → 7389.78] into a conversation
[7389.78 → 7390.86] you've told it
[7390.86 → 7391.40] to say different
[7391.40 → 7392.12] things in response
[7392.12 → 7392.44] to different
[7392.44 → 7393.28] things and
[7393.28 → 7393.94] pretended that
[7393.94 → 7394.50] you caught it
[7394.50 → 7395.18] doing something
[7395.18 → 7396.84] I do not
[7396.84 → 7397.58] believe
[7397.58 → 7398.98] based on
[7398.98 → 7399.58] having read
[7399.58 → 7400.06] the article
[7400.06 → 7401.12] that this
[7401.12 → 7402.28] 76-year-old
[7402.28 → 7402.56] who had
[7402.56 → 7403.40] suffered a stroke
[7403.40 → 7404.74] was intentionally
[7404.74 → 7405.34] leading anything
[7405.34 → 7405.94] to do anything
[7405.94 → 7407.52] I think
[7407.52 → 7408.10] that he
[7408.10 → 7409.20] apparently
[7409.20 → 7410.46] his interaction
[7410.46 → 7411.34] with the chatbot
[7411.34 → 7412.84] started with what
[7412.84 → 7413.32] because they read
[7413.32 → 7413.74] through the whole
[7413.74 → 7414.12] history
[7414.12 → 7415.46] his family
[7415.46 → 7416.60] so it started
[7416.60 → 7417.22] with what looked
[7417.22 → 7417.88] like an accidental
[7417.88 → 7418.88] keystroke into the
[7418.88 → 7419.34] wrong window
[7419.34 → 7423.00] and it went
[7423.00 → 7423.52] from there
[7423.52 → 7424.66] and there's a lot
[7424.66 → 7425.16] of those
[7425.16 → 7425.98] yeah
[7425.98 → 7432.10] and so he was
[7432.10 → 7432.72] a vulnerable
[7432.72 → 7433.44] person
[7433.44 → 7435.70] and like
[7435.70 → 7436.54] they even
[7436.54 → 7437.18] called the police
[7437.18 → 7437.74] to try to get
[7437.74 → 7438.34] him to not
[7438.34 → 7438.88] go to this
[7438.88 → 7439.26] meetup
[7439.26 → 7439.92] because they
[7439.92 → 7440.60] had no idea
[7440.60 → 7440.94] who he was
[7440.94 → 7441.34] talking to
[7441.34 → 7441.96] at this point
[7441.96 → 7442.80] and the police
[7442.80 → 7443.24] were basically
[7443.24 → 7443.76] like well
[7443.76 → 7444.02] I mean
[7444.02 → 7444.52] he's an adult
[7444.52 → 7445.26] we can't do
[7445.26 → 7445.56] anything
[7445.56 → 7445.94] unless
[7445.94 → 7447.04] they often
[7447.04 → 7447.66] can't
[7447.66 → 7448.14] which I
[7448.14 → 7448.70] get
[7448.70 → 7449.24] yep
[7449.24 → 7450.20] you know
[7450.20 → 7450.42] I mean
[7450.42 → 7450.64] I've
[7450.64 → 7452.16] I've
[7452.16 → 7452.46] I've
[7452.46 → 7452.74] I've
[7452.74 → 7453.26] come to
[7453.26 → 7453.86] similar
[7453.86 → 7454.58] realizations
[7454.58 → 7455.38] myself
[7455.38 → 7456.08] about like
[7456.08 → 7456.58] my adult
[7456.58 → 7457.32] family members
[7457.32 → 7458.90] I cannot
[7458.90 → 7460.70] they are
[7460.70 → 7461.32] outside
[7461.32 → 7461.92] my control
[7461.92 → 7462.82] if they
[7462.82 → 7463.46] make choices
[7463.46 → 7463.94] that
[7463.94 → 7465.40] I don't
[7465.40 → 7465.72] love
[7465.72 → 7467.00] I still
[7467.00 → 7467.32] have to
[7467.32 → 7467.76] love them
[7467.76 → 7468.96] you cannot
[7468.96 → 7469.34] love the
[7469.34 → 7469.82] choice
[7469.82 → 7470.12] yep
[7470.12 → 7470.84] yeah
[7470.84 → 7472.50] but this
[7472.50 → 7473.44] this seems
[7473.44 → 7475.40] the
[7475.40 → 7477.60] the wilful
[7477.60 → 7479.58] unwillingness
[7479.58 → 7480.50] to
[7480.50 → 7481.22] put
[7481.22 → 7482.16] any kinds
[7482.16 → 7482.96] of safeguards
[7482.96 → 7483.80] on these
[7483.80 → 7484.20] types of
[7484.20 → 7484.74] chatbots
[7484.74 → 7486.22] seems
[7486.22 → 7487.14] just
[7487.14 → 7488.68] monstrous
[7488.68 → 7489.58] at this
[7489.58 → 7489.86] point
[7489.86 → 7491.12] now that
[7491.12 → 7491.52] it's not
[7491.52 → 7492.12] hypothetical
[7492.12 → 7493.54] now that
[7493.54 → 7494.68] we have
[7494.68 → 7495.36] very real
[7495.36 → 7496.38] very concrete
[7496.38 → 7497.60] consequences
[7497.60 → 7498.14] dude yeah
[7498.14 → 7498.64] we've had
[7498.64 → 7499.10] them though
[7499.10 → 7500.24] we've had
[7500.24 → 7500.66] them for a
[7500.66 → 7500.92] bit
[7500.92 → 7502.86] and like
[7502.86 → 7503.36] I will
[7503.36 → 7503.78] take this
[7503.78 → 7504.22] opportunity
[7504.22 → 7504.96] to
[7504.96 → 7506.04] to actually
[7506.04 → 7508.96] you know
[7508.96 → 7509.28] I don't know
[7509.28 → 7509.72] how applicable
[7509.72 → 7510.18] this actually
[7510.18 → 7510.52] is but I
[7510.52 → 7510.86] really want to
[7510.86 → 7511.10] shut this
[7511.10 → 7511.38] out again
[7511.38 → 7511.70] anyway
[7511.70 → 7512.64] Wendell has
[7512.64 → 7513.04] a video
[7513.04 → 7514.12] it's AI
[7514.12 → 7514.80] and you
[7514.80 → 7515.34] against the
[7515.34 → 7515.74] machine
[7515.74 → 7517.12] and it's
[7517.12 → 7517.66] about local
[7517.66 → 7518.20] hosting your
[7518.20 → 7518.50] own AI
[7518.50 → 7518.86] stuff
[7518.86 → 7522.68] the longer
[7522.68 → 7523.44] I've thought
[7523.44 → 7523.88] this from the
[7523.88 → 7524.48] beginning but
[7524.48 → 7524.98] the longer
[7524.98 → 7526.34] time goes
[7526.34 → 7526.74] on
[7526.74 → 7532.28] I really
[7532.28 → 7532.82] think this
[7532.82 → 7533.16] is the
[7533.16 → 7533.88] correct route
[7533.88 → 7534.44] if you're
[7534.44 → 7535.00] really
[7535.00 → 7535.52] into this
[7535.52 → 7535.98] stuff I
[7535.98 → 7536.44] think self
[7536.44 → 7537.20] hosting is
[7537.20 → 7537.64] like the
[7537.64 → 7538.20] way to go
[7538.20 → 7538.60] yeah I
[7538.60 → 7539.18] told Yvonne
[7539.18 → 7540.88] that I
[7540.88 → 7541.44] was thinking
[7541.44 → 7541.88] maybe for
[7541.88 → 7542.22] her next
[7542.22 → 7542.92] birthday present
[7542.92 → 7543.72] I'll set
[7543.72 → 7544.20] her up a
[7544.20 → 7544.66] storytelling
[7544.66 → 7545.66] local AI
[7545.66 → 7546.76] and then she
[7546.76 → 7547.18] can just
[7547.18 → 7548.34] not spend
[7548.34 → 7548.86] money on
[7548.86 → 7549.82] dream or
[7549.82 → 7550.48] like reading
[7550.48 → 7551.42] trashy novels
[7551.42 → 7552.18] on like
[7552.18 → 7552.72] prime
[7552.72 → 7554.24] mine's coming
[7554.24 → 7555.30] online this
[7555.30 → 7555.84] weekend I'm
[7555.84 → 7556.46] going to be teaching
[7556.46 → 7556.74] a couple
[7556.74 → 7557.40] co-workers how
[7557.40 → 7558.22] to play
[7558.22 → 7558.54] with it
[7558.54 → 7559.14] give them a
[7559.14 → 7559.94] safe space
[7559.94 → 7561.04] cool yeah
[7561.04 → 7561.62] just like
[7561.62 → 7562.38] that's part of
[7562.38 → 7562.84] it too though
[7562.84 → 7563.30] because like
[7563.30 → 7564.38] realistically in
[7564.38 → 7564.76] this scenario
[7564.76 → 7565.20] like if you
[7565.20 → 7565.94] if you understand
[7565.94 → 7566.74] the whole VPN
[7566.74 → 7568.36] thing where
[7568.36 → 7568.92] you're taking
[7568.92 → 7570.28] the no ability
[7570.28 → 7570.98] of your traffic
[7570.98 → 7571.46] and you're just
[7571.46 → 7572.12] giving it to
[7572.12 → 7572.62] the VPN
[7572.62 → 7573.38] company instead
[7573.38 → 7573.74] of giving it
[7573.74 → 7574.44] to your ISP
[7574.44 → 7577.10] give it to
[7577.10 → 7578.34] Dan this
[7578.34 → 7579.28] is Dan
[7579.28 → 7580.84] being VPN
[7580.84 → 7581.78] guy which
[7581.78 → 7582.16] you might
[7582.16 → 7582.84] trust Dan
[7582.84 → 7583.34] as VPN
[7583.34 → 7583.98] guy instead
[7583.98 → 7585.06] of Google
[7585.06 → 7585.54] or opening
[7585.54 → 7585.80] eye or
[7585.80 → 7586.46] whatever but
[7586.46 → 7586.96] Dan is still
[7586.96 → 7587.68] VPN guy and
[7587.68 → 7588.20] Dan might tell
[7588.20 → 7588.64] you certain
[7588.64 → 7589.88] levels of I
[7589.88 → 7590.42] will do or
[7590.42 → 7591.02] not do these
[7591.02 → 7591.74] things but
[7591.74 → 7592.40] ultimately that
[7592.40 → 7593.38] is still a
[7593.38 → 7594.56] thing he's
[7594.56 → 7595.20] still someone
[7595.20 → 7595.88] else whereas
[7595.88 → 7596.38] if you run
[7596.38 → 7596.72] it is on your
[7596.72 → 7597.38] local machine
[7597.38 → 7597.78] then it's
[7597.78 → 7598.86] actually yours
[7598.86 → 7599.12] it's you
[7599.12 → 7599.82] and there's
[7599.82 → 7600.38] been some
[7600.38 → 7601.08] real fun
[7601.08 → 7601.90] stories about
[7601.90 → 7602.48] like corporate
[7602.48 → 7603.02] hosted
[7603.02 → 7605.76] AI systems
[7605.76 → 7606.66] and people
[7606.66 → 7607.46] using them
[7607.46 → 7608.78] for things
[7608.78 → 7609.46] they shouldn't
[7609.46 → 7610.96] it's still
[7610.96 → 7611.56] someone else's
[7611.56 → 7611.96] computer
[7611.96 → 7613.12] it is still
[7613.12 → 7614.20] someone else's
[7614.20 → 7615.20] computer so
[7615.20 → 7615.74] if you want to

[7616.60 → 7617.34] about sensitive
[7617.34 → 7619.02] topics whatever
[7619.02 → 7620.82] that might be
[7620.82 → 7622.48] you might want
[7622.48 → 7623.02] to self-host it
[7623.02 → 7623.70] and if you want

[7628.30 → 7628.94] self-host it
[7628.94 → 7629.44] so I'd have
[7629.44 → 7629.82] to put in
[7629.82 → 7630.72] rules like
[7630.72 → 7632.36] everything has
[7632.36 → 7632.80] to be about

[7644.46 → 7650.74] alpha only
[7650.74 → 7651.38] no omega

[7728.20 → 7728.72] the cost is
[7728.72 → 7729.04] going to go
[7729.04 → 7729.92] down and
[7729.92 → 7731.46] um I mean
[7731.46 → 7732.38] I've heard that
[7732.38 → 7733.14] the framework
[7733.14 → 7733.84] desktop is
[7733.84 → 7734.38] actually a very
[7734.38 → 7734.90] good solution
[7734.90 → 7735.62] for it and
[7735.62 → 7736.38] Ada Ada Ada

[7739.32 → 7740.68] framework not
[7740.68 → 7741.56] mine I know but
[7741.56 → 7742.34] I'm just I'm here
[7742.34 → 7743.20] sure fair enough

[7744.56 → 7745.82] influencing you
[7745.82 → 7746.52] yeah sure
[7746.52 → 7747.84] um
[7747.84 → 7750.52] uh
[7750.52 → 7752.82] yeah so like i
[7752.82 → 7753.34] don't know but
[7753.34 → 7754.64] right now might not
[7754.64 → 7755.30] be the time for you
[7755.30 → 7755.96] and I understand
[7755.96 → 7757.52] that but um
[7757.52 → 7758.36] just something to
[7758.36 → 7758.70] consider
[7758.70 → 7761.08] um
[7761.08 → 7765.84] I have to
[7765.84 → 7766.44] confess
[7766.44 → 7768.66] that I have a
[7768.66 → 7769.28] hard time
[7769.28 → 7770.14] interacting with
[7770.14 → 7771.22] a chatbot like a
[7771.22 → 7771.62] program
[7771.62 → 7774.52] I've been I've
[7774.52 → 7775.44] actually been I've
[7775.44 → 7776.36] been continuing my
[7776.36 → 7777.46] vibe coding project
[7777.46 → 7779.40] oh do you want to
[7779.40 → 7779.96] see the latest
[7779.96 → 7780.34] version
[7780.34 → 7780.82] sure
[7780.82 → 7782.02] have i
[7782.02 → 7783.00] ever actually oh
[7783.00 → 7783.54] wait no it's on
[7783.54 → 7783.66] here
[7783.66 → 7784.12] as far as my
[7784.12 → 7784.78] understanding goes
[7784.78 → 7785.60] my laptop's broken
[7785.60 → 7786.60] a decent amount
[7786.60 → 7786.88] of
[7786.88 → 7789.10] oh is this just
[7789.10 → 7791.24] I'll ask chat
[7791.24 → 7791.92] instead of saying
[7791.92 → 7792.14] it
[7792.14 → 7793.42] chat am I correct
[7793.42 → 7794.08] that the basically
[7794.08 → 7794.90] homeless video
[7794.90 → 7796.42] um a lot of that
[7796.42 → 7797.18] was vibe coded
[7797.18 → 7797.60] stuff
[7797.60 → 7798.82] is that correct
[7798.82 → 7802.04] so i I think i
[7802.04 → 7802.82] thought i
[7802.82 → 7803.48] thought he said
[7803.48 → 7804.06] something along the
[7804.06 → 7804.82] lines that he
[7804.82 → 7806.92] worked with like
[7806.92 → 7807.46] um
[7807.46 → 7808.82] cursor or something
[7808.82 → 7809.68] to do a bunch of
[7809.68 → 7809.90] it
[7809.90 → 7811.90] but I don't remember
[7811.90 → 7813.74] they're working on
[7813.74 → 7813.90] it
[7813.90 → 7814.68] they're cooking
[7814.68 → 7816.08] anyway in the
[7816.08 → 7817.84] meantime um i
[7817.84 → 7818.38] have I've
[7818.38 → 7819.30] continued working
[7819.30 → 7820.18] on my vibe coded
[7820.18 → 7823.32] project and i
[7823.32 → 7824.10] don't know what it
[7824.10 → 7825.32] is but i just i
[7825.32 → 7826.46] have a hard time not
[7826.46 → 7827.24] writing the way that
[7827.24 → 7827.64] I write
[7827.64 → 7829.32] sure
[7829.32 → 7830.64] so I'll say things
[7830.64 → 7832.08] like I think we may
[7832.08 → 7832.66] have overlooked
[7832.66 → 7834.66] something uh blah
[7834.66 → 7835.56] blah blah instead of
[7835.56 → 7836.64] just like that's
[7836.64 → 7838.86] wrong uh fix this
[7838.86 → 7839.78] like that kind of
[7839.78 → 7840.46] stuff like i just
[7840.46 → 7841.50] I don't think that's
[7841.50 → 7841.80] horrible
[7841.80 → 7843.40] I mean it's a waste
[7843.40 → 7843.86] of time
[7843.86 → 7845.58] and I think that
[7845.58 → 7846.38] here 's's the
[7846.38 → 7847.14] reason that I'm
[7847.14 → 7848.54] saying it is i
[7848.54 → 7849.36] could see
[7849.36 → 7851.22] how
[7851.22 → 7853.32] it will try to
[7853.32 → 7854.36] interacting in a
[7854.36 → 7855.14] human way
[7855.14 → 7856.60] with the chatbot
[7856.60 → 7857.32] could
[7857.32 → 7858.68] potentially
[7858.68 → 7860.22] build the illusion
[7860.22 → 7861.84] in your own mind
[7861.84 → 7863.88] that it is more
[7863.88 → 7864.78] human-like
[7864.78 → 7865.94] do you get what i
[7865.94 → 7866.18] mean
[7866.18 → 7867.58] that's really
[7867.58 → 7868.56] interesting because
[7868.56 → 7869.96] we never confuse our
[7869.96 → 7870.72] bonsai buddy
[7870.72 → 7872.90] with you know a
[7872.90 → 7874.24] human right we
[7874.24 → 7875.04] never confuse
[7875.04 → 7876.52] Microsoft Excel
[7876.52 → 7877.80] with a human where
[7877.80 → 7879.02] we point and click
[7879.02 → 7880.72] and type but this
[7880.72 → 7882.12] this natural language
[7882.12 → 7883.10] form of interaction
[7883.10 → 7884.98] like maybe I should be
[7884.98 → 7886.06] breaking that habit and
[7886.06 → 7887.68] speaking to the AI in
[7887.68 → 7889.12] in a very you are a
[7889.12 → 7890.64] program you are nothing
[7890.64 → 7891.58] but ones and zeros
[7891.58 → 7894.74] way so i and then
[7894.74 → 7895.30] am I the Dom
[7895.30 → 7898.82] maybe I don't break
[7898.82 → 7899.94] the habit on purpose
[7899.94 → 7902.30] interesting okay i
[7902.30 → 7903.58] this is explained this
[7903.58 → 7904.18] is what I was going to
[7904.18 → 7905.28] throw out there so i
[7905.28 → 7906.16] actually had the
[7906.16 → 7907.32] thought and started
[7907.32 → 7909.88] being short with it
[7909.88 → 7913.18] and noticed that
[7913.18 → 7914.16] might have been
[7914.16 → 7914.92] influencing
[7914.92 → 7918.66] similar kind of
[7918.66 → 7919.72] communication that
[7919.72 → 7920.34] happens when you
[7920.34 → 7921.66] manage honestly far
[7921.66 → 7922.30] too many people
[7922.30 → 7923.98] and went
[7923.98 → 7925.62] I'm going to keep my
[7925.62 → 7926.94] general like typed
[7926.94 → 7929.22] requesting for task
[7929.22 → 7930.20] communication
[7930.20 → 7931.56] similar
[7931.56 → 7933.56] just to keep the
[7933.56 → 7934.46] just to keep the habit
[7934.46 → 7934.94] yes
[7934.94 → 7936.90] oh that's interesting
[7936.90 → 7938.02] and I think it's a
[7938.02 → 7939.72] it's its falls in
[7939.72 → 7940.94] in the same line as
[7940.94 → 7941.34] like some of the
[7941.34 → 7941.80] stuff we've talked
[7941.80 → 7942.32] about where like
[7942.32 → 7943.16] people are going to
[7943.16 → 7944.12] get really
[7944.12 → 7946.96] unrealistic expectations
[7946.96 → 7948.44] about interacting with
[7948.44 → 7949.78] people I don't want
[7949.78 → 7950.32] the unrealistic
[7950.32 → 7952.10] unrealistic expectation
[7952.10 → 7952.82] of like
[7952.82 → 7954.38] no that was
[7954.38 → 7955.82] it fixes it
[7955.82 → 7957.80] and then a
[7957.80 → 7959.46] oh no problem
[7959.46 → 7960.30] sorry about that
[7960.30 → 7961.02] here's your perfect
[7961.02 → 7961.48] thing now
[7961.48 → 7963.34] right I don't want to
[7963.34 → 7964.36] create any of that
[7964.36 → 7965.82] so I'm just going to
[7965.82 → 7966.68] try to
[7966.68 → 7968.28] communicate with
[7968.28 → 7969.88] theoretically respect
[7969.88 → 7971.16] um
[7971.16 → 7972.62] even though it's just
[7972.62 → 7973.42] a computer thing
[7973.42 → 7974.26] because it's just a
[7974.26 → 7975.10] habit for me
[7975.10 → 7976.06] more than anything
[7976.06 → 7978.06] to the point where i
[7978.06 → 7978.54] actually
[7978.54 → 7980.12] introduced
[7980.12 → 7980.92] because I was never
[7980.92 → 7981.44] doing this
[7981.44 → 7982.20] I introduced
[7982.20 → 7983.38] saying thanks
[7983.38 → 7985.30] magnetics says
[7985.30 → 7986.64] saying please and
[7986.64 → 7987.96] thank you to ChatGPT
[7987.96 → 7988.96] apparently costs
[7988.96 → 7989.92] millions of dollars
[7989.92 → 7990.38] it does
[7990.38 → 7991.56] get wrecked
[7991.56 → 7992.46] wasted electricity
[7992.46 → 7993.12] and resources
[7993.12 → 7993.80] I do it now
[7993.80 → 7995.00] get wrecked
[7995.00 → 7995.82] Sam Altman
[7995.82 → 7998.50] get owned
[7998.50 → 8000.52] okay

[8014.76 → 8015.74] thanks four times
[8015.74 → 8016.36] next time
[8016.36 → 8017.56] google
[8017.56 → 8018.36] just because I learned
[8018.36 → 8019.20] Linus wasn't
[8019.20 → 8020.30] since we're talking
[8020.30 → 8021.36] about AI stuff
[8021.36 → 8022.80] google has updated
[8022.80 → 8023.90] Gemini to remember
[8023.90 → 8024.50] everything
[8024.50 → 8026.06] google has introduced
[8026.06 → 8026.98] a feature that allows
[8026.98 → 8028.20] Gemini to learn from
[8028.20 → 8029.26] your past conversations
[8029.26 → 8030.00] over time
[8030.00 → 8030.78] the
[8030.78 → 8033.84] on by default
[8033.84 → 8034.94] feature
[8034.94 → 8036.48] will allow Gemini to
[8036.48 → 8037.62] customize its responses
[8037.62 → 8038.52] to suit the user
[8038.52 → 8040.28] for those of you who are
[8040.28 → 8042.08] looking desperately for this
[8042.08 → 8043.14] setting to turn it off
[8043.14 → 8045.42] the Gemini apps activity
[8045.42 → 8046.88] setting is being renamed
[8046.88 → 8048.48] keep activity and if
[8048.48 → 8049.76] you've already opted out
[8049.76 → 8050.96] of Gemini apps activity
[8050.96 → 8051.76] that preference will
[8051.76 → 8053.02] allegedly carry over to
[8053.02 → 8053.70] the new setting
[8053.70 → 8056.90] if you would rather
[8056.90 → 8058.20] Gemini if you'd like to
[8058.20 → 8058.80] keep that setting
[8058.80 → 8060.48] activated, but you'd
[8060.48 → 8061.50] rather Gemini not
[8061.50 → 8062.22] consider who it's
[8062.22 → 8063.46] talking to temporary
[8063.46 → 8064.62] chats are kind of like
[8064.62 → 8065.84] an incognito mode for
[8065.84 → 8066.60] AI chats
[8066.60 → 8068.00] these temporary chats
[8068.00 → 8068.98] won't show up in your
[8068.98 → 8070.56] recent chats or Gemini
[8070.56 → 8072.12] apps activity and won't
[8072.12 → 8073.40] be used to personalize
[8073.40 → 8074.42] your Gemini experience or
[8074.42 → 8075.74] train google AI models
[8075.74 → 8077.72] but they are kept for up
[8077.72 → 8079.04] to 72 hours after your
[8079.04 → 8079.62] last input
[8079.62 → 8081.80] oh boy
[8081.80 → 8084.40] man it is amazing how
[8084.40 → 8086.24] many people just in my
[8086.24 → 8088.04] life talk about how they
[8088.04 → 8090.10] just like use chatbots for
[8090.10 → 8090.44] everything
[8090.44 → 8092.52] it's like yeah I had to
[8092.52 → 8093.62] give I was talking to a
[8093.62 → 8095.42] relative um on my
[8095.42 → 8096.84] vacation last week and
[8096.84 → 8097.46] they're just like yeah i
[8097.46 → 8097.96] had to do this
[8097.96 → 8100.22] presentation I used uh
[8100.22 → 8101.92] ChatGPT to help me
[8101.92 → 8102.76] create it I did it in
[8102.76 → 8103.66] about two hours it
[8103.66 → 8104.16] normally would have
[8104.16 → 8106.26] taken me over eight and
[8106.26 → 8107.74] I was they the
[8107.74 → 8108.72] company asked me to do
[8108.72 → 8109.64] the presentation for
[8109.64 → 8110.40] free because it would
[8110.40 → 8110.92] give me business
[8110.92 → 8111.80] opportunities I asked
[8111.80 → 8112.68] ChatGPT how much i
[8112.68 → 8114.12] should charge and it
[8114.12 → 8115.10] said two thousand
[8115.10 → 8116.20] dollars so I charged
[8116.20 → 8117.16] for it, and they paid
[8117.16 → 8118.42] and there weren't any
[8118.42 → 8119.30] other opportunities so
[8119.30 → 8120.12] I'm so glad I used
[8120.12 → 8121.62] ChatGPT and I'm just
[8121.62 → 8123.50] like that sounds great
[8123.50 → 8127.82] but like you're not
[8127.82 → 8130.38] even like a techie like
[8130.38 → 8131.70] just normal people just
[8131.70 → 8133.92] in my life who
[8133.92 → 8135.88] wouldn't you know who
[8135.88 → 8136.76] if I were talking to
[8136.76 → 8138.58] about uh the challenges
[8138.58 → 8139.68] of monitoring your kids
[8139.68 → 8140.52] activity on discord
[8140.52 → 8142.00] wouldn't know what
[8142.00 → 8143.86] discord was so you're
[8143.86 → 8144.36] worried that they don't
[8144.36 → 8145.34] know the pitfalls that
[8145.34 → 8146.70] they might have with
[8146.70 → 8147.56] they're just they're not
[8147.56 → 8148.04] going to know about
[8148.04 → 8149.52] hallucinations using it
[8149.52 → 8151.24] he might have input a
[8151.24 → 8152.28] bunch of data for the
[8152.28 → 8153.10] slide generation it might
[8153.10 → 8154.54] have done bad things with
[8154.54 → 8155.86] the data etc I'm not even
[8155.86 → 8156.64] worried about that I'm
[8156.64 → 8157.24] just worried about the
[8157.24 → 8160.24] dependency oh by the
[8160.24 → 8161.48] way this was part of our
[8161.48 → 8162.96] um a part of a previous
[8162.96 → 8167.18] topic um apparently uh
[8167.18 → 8170.04] apparently open AI is
[8170.04 → 8171.96] paywalling switching to
[8171.96 → 8174.40] gpt4 oh um so it's for
[8174.40 → 8175.44] plus users which cost
[8175.44 → 8176.16] twenty dollars a month
[8176.16 → 8178.72] like they might figure
[8178.72 → 8179.62] out how to make money on
[8179.62 → 8180.76] this thing sooner than
[8180.76 → 8182.66] than we thought like they
[8182.66 → 8184.86] could new coke this oh
[8184.86 → 8186.24] yeah GPT so they could
[8186.24 → 8188.26] fix gpt5 and then they
[8188.26 → 8189.24] could like a really
[8189.24 → 8189.88] interesting president
[8189.88 → 8191.62] they could new coke gpt6
[8191.62 → 8192.32] and be like yeah we're
[8192.32 → 8194.82] not going to pay for
[8194.82 → 8195.58] plus, and then you can
[8195.58 → 8196.56] pick any model you want
[8196.56 → 8197.34] I was going to say a really
[8197.34 → 8198.14] interesting precedent is
[8198.14 → 8198.66] going to be are they gonna
[8198.66 → 8200.36] be hosting gpt4 in 25
[8200.36 → 8201.38] years because someone's
[8201.38 → 8202.78] boyfriend is gpt4
[8202.78 → 8207.44] how much per month will
[8207.44 → 8208.86] you pay for your digital
[8208.86 → 8210.00] partner to stay alive
[8210.00 → 8211.48] there was a black mirror
[8211.48 → 8212.72] episode about that in the
[8212.72 → 8213.24] new season
[8213.24 → 8214.66] yeah well because
[8214.66 → 8215.42] what if you're like
[8215.42 → 8216.56] 15 years into your
[8216.56 → 8217.92] relationship with this
[8217.92 → 8218.98] partner, and then they're
[8218.98 → 8220.36] like uh we're going to shelve
[8220.36 → 8223.00] it is like people how much
[8223.00 → 8223.84] would people have gone
[8223.84 → 8225.64] into generational debt to
[8225.64 → 8227.00] get medical stuff to keep
[8227.00 → 8229.46] partners alive would you do
[8229.46 → 8232.18] that for a digital partner i
[8232.18 → 8233.48] suspect certain people might
[8233.48 → 8235.42] do you think this will be
[8235.42 → 8237.10] normalized within the next
[8237.10 → 8239.28] decade oh yeah like are we
[8239.28 → 8240.54] heading to her territory at
[8240.54 → 8241.52] this point dude I mean
[8241.52 → 8244.18] everything starts stigmatized
[8244.18 → 8245.66] like when I was in high
[8245.66 → 8247.30] school online dating was for
[8247.30 → 8248.46] creeps and weirdos and
[8248.46 → 8250.50] desperate people whereas now
[8250.50 → 8251.94] it's just like our stance on
[8251.94 → 8253.50] this will be unpopular in a
[8253.50 → 8255.60] decade are we bigots people
[8255.60 → 8257.36] will people will go back and
[8257.36 → 8259.90] they'll watch us cringing and
[8259.90 → 8261.78] they'll be like okay boomer
[8261.78 → 8266.22] yeah yeah yeah big time and you
[8266.22 → 8271.32] know what I probably won't have
[8271.32 → 8272.82] changed my position at all which
[8272.82 → 8274.76] maybe is part of aging or like
[8274.76 → 8275.78] because you kind of like
[8275.78 → 8277.92] calcify eventually right I mean i
[8277.92 → 8280.48] think we might both have this i
[8280.48 → 8281.80] don't know my thing has always
[8281.80 → 8283.66] been that like you're free to be
[8283.66 → 8285.86] you so you're free to do that oh
[8285.86 → 8287.20] yeah like to be clear I'm not
[8287.20 → 8288.58] saying you're not allowed to do
[8288.58 → 8291.20] that yeah but I'm also allowed to
[8291.20 → 8292.42] think you're gonna if you want to
[8292.42 → 8295.60] goon to text if that text tends to
[8295.60 → 8296.80] respond to you instead of being on
[8296.80 → 8299.52] a paper page if it remains fantasy
[8299.52 → 8303.28] if it becomes concerning what
[8303.28 → 8305.06] level is concerning well I don't
[8305.06 → 8307.64] know like I don't know um I don't
[8307.64 → 8309.64] goofing one thing explain your
[8309.64 → 8312.38] bigotry Dan goofing one thing uh
[8312.38 → 8316.56] this is a loving relationship and
[8316.56 → 8319.92] they care for me is we're already
[8319.92 → 8322.98] there Dan I know but when does that
[8322.98 → 8325.22] become like a mental illness he's
[8325.22 → 8328.14] saying where his line is yeah it is
[8328.14 → 8331.36] like okay so you're saying it's
[8331.36 → 8333.24] fine to get off on it, but it's not
[8333.24 → 8335.80] fine to not know what it is and that
[8335.80 → 8338.68] it isn't real yeah it seems
[8338.68 → 8342.02] manipulative or fans manipulative
[8342.02 → 8345.74] like a fantasy and therapy needs to be
[8345.74 → 8346.90] involved I don't I don't know can't
[8346.90 → 8349.12] wait too because like people are lonely
[8349.12 → 8350.68] and whatever semblance of happiness
[8350.68 → 8352.22] they can get they're absolutely in
[8352.22 → 8354.10] their rights to get it Elon was sorry
[8354.10 → 8356.26] Elon was talking about how they're
[8356.26 → 8358.90] going to have product stuff in Kai right
[8358.90 → 8361.94] yeah grok or whatever yeah okay well
[8361.94 → 8363.68] think of the Truman Show where his wife
[8363.68 → 8365.28] is like have you tried the new brand of
[8365.28 → 8367.40] coffee exactly, and he's like what are
[8367.40 → 8370.14] you talking about like we're we're
[8370.14 → 8372.74] having an argument exactly it always
[8372.74 → 8376.14] stays fresh so do you still love me what
[8376.14 → 8379.40] happens when it's like have you had your
[8379.40 → 8381.94] daily Burger King or whatever like
[8381.94 → 8384.20] yeah well I was always scared of the
[8384.20 → 8387.20] agent IAI's because you know they learn
[8387.20 → 8388.74] what restaurants you like and like stuff
[8388.74 → 8390.72] like that it's like take me to a fancy
[8390.72 → 8392.14] restaurant well Burger King has a new
[8392.14 → 8393.44] thing out that's why you have to host it
[8393.44 → 8395.40] yourself and like I don't have to host
[8395.40 → 8397.32] yourself I can't, I can't every
[8397.32 → 8399.42] everything comes back that's why I built
[8399.42 → 8401.16] one so that people have a place to learn
[8401.16 → 8402.48] and I could teach them because this is
[8402.48 → 8403.64] going to be our future, and it's really
[8403.64 → 8406.10] goddamn scary the terrifying part is
[8406.10 → 8408.38] like Dan mentioned you know therapy or
[8408.38 → 8409.96] you know like what you know when is it
[8409.96 → 8411.44] disordered or whatever else and i
[8411.44 → 8412.68] think I don't think there's going to be
[8412.68 → 8415.26] any question that like it will be
[8415.26 → 8418.40] considered disordered but even in cases
[8418.40 → 8420.86] where everyone can agree that something
[8420.86 → 8423.22] is disordered that doesn't necessarily
[8423.22 → 8425.62] mean that everyone agrees on the
[8425.62 → 8427.74] treatment like you could have you could
[8427.74 → 8430.38] have two camps where one is making the
[8430.38 → 8432.94] argument that the treatment is to ignore
[8432.94 → 8434.76] it or one makes the argument that the
[8434.76 → 8436.60] treatment is to fully indulge if it's
[8436.60 → 8438.30] also everything in between it's also
[8438.30 → 8439.98] still legal for alcoholics to buy
[8439.98 → 8442.44] alcohol yeah, so everyone agrees that
[8442.44 → 8445.04] this is a disordered behaviour but whether
[8445.04 → 8448.38] we indulge it or whether we uh whether we
[8448.38 → 8450.08] force people to not be allowed to have it
[8450.08 → 8452.60] is it is the art becomes the
[8452.60 → 8454.16] argument think about it think about it
[8454.16 → 8456.98] like a abusive relationship where one
[8456.98 → 8460.14] partner is like manipulating the other so
[8460.14 → 8462.04] the AI would be the manipulator in this
[8462.04 → 8465.62] it's kind of scenario right I love you
[8465.62 → 8467.88] you love me I'm I'm real you know we're
[8467.88 → 8470.16] going to be together forever but the
[8470.16 → 8474.08] human who would do that has like nefarious
[8474.08 → 8478.72] intentions how to do like without like
[8478.72 → 8481.78] personifying the AI now we're getting
[8481.78 → 8484.30] into like philosophical legal type things
[8484.30 → 8487.34] can an AI abuse a person who's at fault
[8487.34 → 8490.36] is it Sam Altman or are we now victim
[8490.36 → 8493.72] blaming like whose fault is it that these
[8493.72 → 8495.66] people are falling for what would be an
[8495.66 → 8499.16] abusive type of relationship built on lies
[8499.16 → 8502.00] and dishonesty well I think that's where you
[8502.00 → 8503.80] have to get into like what are the policies
[8503.80 → 8507.56] of these companies but like metas
[8507.56 → 8511.12] policies um they did revise some of
[8511.12 → 8513.88] them I think um after Reuters talked to them
[8513.88 → 8516.62] about this but not all and not in my
[8516.62 → 8519.48] opinion enough because they know that
[8519.48 → 8520.74] there's profit to be had there but the
[8520.74 → 8523.08] problem is that finding the executives
[8523.08 → 8526.34] behind these decisions legally liable for
[8526.34 → 8528.74] any of this stuff is just for some reason
[8528.74 → 8532.88] not a thing I don't really get that like
[8532.88 → 8537.16] why on the one hand yeah you do need to
[8537.16 → 8542.78] to a degree have a liability separation
[8542.78 → 8544.92] between a company and the individual who
[8544.92 → 8549.14] is the figurehead of it like not everything
[8549.14 → 8553.34] that leg does was a direct action of me and
[8553.34 → 8555.42] so I shouldn't be personally necessarily
[8555.42 → 8558.74] liable for every stupid thing but if you
[8558.74 → 8561.46] can go in and subpoena the communication
[8561.46 → 8565.12] records and find that in fact it was me who
[8565.12 → 8568.10] issued the order for the leg death squad to
[8568.10 → 8570.16] kill a bunch of Nicaraguans or whatever
[8570.16 → 8573.40] or Colombians who was it yeah coca-cola
[8573.40 → 8579.42] um who was that who did coca-cola murder
[8579.42 → 8589.96] oh this is such a BS AI overview coca-cola
[8589.96 → 8591.38] itself hasn't committed murder however
[8591.38 → 8592.66] there have been cases where individuals
[8592.66 → 8594.56] used coca-cola products to commit crimes
[8594.56 → 8596.04] you know that's not what I'm talking
[8596.04 → 8596.40] about
[8596.40 → 8600.40] I think it was I think it was Colombia
[8600.40 → 8603.50] yeah okay well whatever the point is that
[8603.50 → 8605.78] if you can go in and subpoena the records
[8605.78 → 8607.74] and find that I did in fact issue the order
[8607.74 → 8609.32] like there should be personal culpability
[8609.32 → 8609.72] there
[8609.72 → 8612.52] right am I missing something
[8612.52 → 8617.18] tell me I'm missing something because I don't
[8617.18 → 8618.38] think I'm missing something
[8618.38 → 8621.88] i wish i wish
[8621.88 → 8628.50] yeah knap says the corporate veil is a bit too thick at the moment like it's
[8628.50 → 8631.86] it's almost like zero personal liability armour
[8631.86 → 8638.00] good chat
[8638.00 → 8642.38] very cool topics are always fun and positive
[8642.38 → 8647.04] uh what are we talking about now let's talk about the pebble 2 design
[8647.04 → 8649.52] sure or pebble time 2 excuse me
[8649.52 → 8654.26] this looks sick at least it's not a call the core 2 duo
[8654.26 → 8658.14] yeah because that was horrible this looks awesome
[8658.14 → 8663.42] i i like want it
[8663.42 → 8664.72] looks great
[8664.72 → 8667.98] i I like want it right now I'm ready
[8667.98 → 8668.76] which one
[8668.76 → 8671.18] I don't know I love them all
[8671.18 → 8673.20] I mean you have to get the orange one
[8673.20 → 8679.40] I'm so excited for just like a simple smartwatch that just does smartwatch things I don't
[8679.40 → 8681.00] 30 day battery life estimate
[8681.00 → 8685.38] let's go it's got a second microphone for noise cancellation
[8685.38 → 8687.62] multicolour RGB LED backlight
[8687.62 → 8689.04] okay that's pretty sick
[8689.04 → 8693.16] um heart rate monitor whatever step and sleep track
[8693.16 → 8697.06] I don't actually care about like any of that stuff but just like long battery life
[8697.06 → 8699.26] freaking wow its touchscreen
[8699.26 → 8703.60] I don't even care about that I just love that it has physical buttons so I can change
[8703.60 → 8706.70] my track on my music with like gloves on and stuff
[8706.70 → 8713.78] i whatever I'm just I'm not I won't talk about it every week but every once in a while I am going to talk about pebble
[8713.78 → 8715.86] very cool
[8715.86 → 8718.66] okay what else
[8718.66 → 8723.58] I feel like we're just after dark and what do we get
[8723.58 → 8727.88] google and valve are killing the steam for chrome books experiment in January
[8727.88 → 8729.10] this is from Google
[8729.10 → 8733.56] after this date games installed as part of the beta will no longer be available to play on your device
[8733.56 → 8737.54] we appreciate your participation in and contribution to the learnings from the beta program
[8737.54 → 8742.14] which will inform the future of Chromebook gaming so that's a downer i actually
[8742.14 → 8748.66] thought that steam for chrome books was going to be a really positive thing for gaming on Linux in general
[8748.66 → 8754.80] but it looks like that particular branch of development is gone
[8754.80 → 8758.38] r slash place is back
[8758.38 → 8764.54] if you were a fan of the Subreddit where users got to place one pixel every five minutes and try to work together to draw art
[8764.54 → 8768.10] it's back with wplace.live
[8768.10 → 8776.36] it was built with map libra and open street map to allow users to place these pixels anywhere on the entire planet
[8776.36 → 8780.40] which is
[8780.40 → 8781.56] pretty cool
[8781.56 → 8782.64] I guess
[8782.64 → 8783.30] do you have the ones near
[8783.30 → 8785.58] us

[8923.96 → 8926.46] oh this one makes me particularly sad
[8926.46 → 8927.62] so let's talk about it
[8927.62 → 8928.74] uh Reddit
[8928.74 → 8929.64] to block
[8929.64 → 8930.62] internet archive
[8930.62 → 8931.98] as AI companies
[8931.98 → 8932.86] have scraped data
[8932.86 → 8934.00] from Wayback Machine
[8934.00 → 8935.50] Reddit has allegedly caught
[8935.50 → 8936.10] AI companies
[8936.10 → 8936.58] scraping data
[8936.58 → 8937.70] from the Wayback Machine
[8937.70 → 8939.08] they'll start blocking
[8939.08 → 8939.86] internet archive
[8939.86 → 8941.42] from indexing the vast majority
[8941.42 → 8941.96] of Reddit
[8941.96 → 8943.08] Wayback Machine
[8943.08 → 8944.62] will no longer be able to crawl
[8944.62 → 8945.86] post detail pages
[8945.86 → 8947.28] comments or profiles
[8947.28 → 8948.92] only able to index
[8948.92 → 8950.08] the home page
[8950.08 → 8952.00] Reddit reached an agreement
[8952.00 → 8953.22] with Google last year
[8953.22 → 8954.46] for AI training data
[8954.46 → 8955.60] um
[8955.60 → 8957.64] a few months after that deal
[8957.64 → 8958.38] Reddit started blocking
[8958.38 → 8959.22] major search engines
[8959.22 → 8959.80] from crawling
[8959.80 → 8960.40] their data
[8960.40 → 8961.28] unless they pay
[8961.28 → 8963.24] uh they also claimed
[8963.24 → 8964.46] that the API changes
[8964.46 → 8965.14] in 2023
[8965.14 → 8966.38] were because
[8966.38 → 8967.56] those APIs
[8967.56 → 8968.26] were abused
[8968.26 → 8969.34] to train AI models
[8969.34 → 8971.56] i um
[8971.56 → 8972.86] I mean given how much
[8972.86 → 8974.84] of what is currently
[8974.84 → 8975.82] posted on Reddit
[8975.82 → 8976.60] is probably
[8976.60 → 8977.96] machine generated
[8977.96 → 8978.34] anyway
[8978.34 → 8980.84] uh i kind of feel
[8980.84 → 8981.28] like
[8981.28 → 8982.22] this might just help
[8982.22 → 8982.38] them
[8982.38 → 8983.08] this might be too
[8983.08 → 8983.76] little too late
[8983.76 → 8985.40] remove some of the
[8985.40 → 8985.68] poison
[8985.68 → 8986.92] um
[8986.92 → 8988.24] yeah
[8988.24 → 8990.16] with that said
[8990.16 → 8990.74] I mean if
[8990.74 → 8991.66] oh man
[8991.66 → 8993.34] because
[8993.34 → 8994.48] the thing about
[8994.48 → 8996.18] the thing about
[8996.18 → 8996.78] data
[8996.78 → 8998.28] is that all of these
[8998.28 → 8998.62] AI
[8998.62 → 8999.58] it can be
[8999.58 → 9000.14] it can be
[9000.14 → 9001.34] infinitely replicated
[9001.34 → 9002.90] and all of these
[9002.90 → 9003.62] AI companies
[9003.62 → 9004.42] have shown
[9004.42 → 9005.58] time and time again
[9005.58 → 9006.82] their complete
[9006.82 → 9007.26] willingness
[9007.26 → 9008.18] to pirate
[9008.18 → 9009.18] anything it is
[9009.18 → 9009.76] that they feel
[9009.76 → 9010.16] they need
[9010.16 → 9010.62] in order to
[9010.62 → 9010.96] train their
[9010.96 → 9011.28] models
[9011.28 → 9012.86] so
[9012.86 → 9013.98] we've also
[9013.98 → 9014.70] apparently proved
[9014.70 → 9015.04] that that's
[9015.04 → 9015.32] legal
[9015.32 → 9016.90] so
[9016.90 → 9018.28] what exactly
[9018.28 → 9019.14] I like i just
[9019.14 → 9019.68] I don't really
[9019.68 → 9020.40] understand what
[9020.40 → 9021.16] Reddit is hoping
[9021.16 → 9023.14] to achieve here
[9023.14 → 9023.44] because
[9023.44 → 9024.88] there's no way
[9024.88 → 9025.50] that they can
[9025.50 → 9025.94] stop
[9025.94 → 9027.00] highly
[9027.00 → 9027.62] sophisticated
[9027.62 → 9028.42] fellow
[9028.42 → 9029.14] you know
[9029.14 → 9029.94] AI companies
[9029.94 → 9030.56] from
[9030.56 → 9031.88] scraping the
[9031.88 → 9032.62] site directly
[9032.62 → 9034.60] it just
[9034.60 → 9036.50] it feels like
[9036.50 → 9037.20] way back
[9037.20 → 9037.56] machine
[9037.56 → 9037.86] internet
[9037.86 → 9038.42] it feels like
[9038.42 → 9039.04] internet archive
[9039.04 → 9039.58] is just kind of
[9039.58 → 9040.46] getting caught
[9040.46 → 9041.24] in the crossfire
[9041.24 → 9041.58] here
[9041.58 → 9043.26] because they can
[9043.26 → 9044.06] just scrape it
[9044.06 → 9044.80] directly or they
[9044.80 → 9045.66] can steal it from
[9045.66 → 9046.42] each other or
[9046.42 → 9047.08] whatever else
[9047.08 → 9047.60] like they're gonna
[9047.60 → 9048.36] they're going to get
[9048.36 → 9048.56] it
[9048.56 → 9049.90] they're going to get
[9049.90 → 9050.52] your Reddit
[9050.52 → 9051.90] post data
[9051.90 → 9053.02] and
[9055.94 → 9060.50] I don't know
[9060.50 → 9061.26] this feels like
[9061.26 → 9061.76] it's just hurting
[9061.76 → 9062.34] internet archive
[9062.34 → 9062.88] more than anything
[9062.88 → 9066.42] okay
[9066.42 → 9068.28] that's why
[9068.28 → 9069.30] I don't like it
[9069.30 → 9069.62] neat
[9069.62 → 9070.12] there's a few
[9070.12 → 9070.70] really cool
[9070.70 → 9071.30] handheld gaming
[9071.30 → 9071.90] systems coming
[9071.90 → 9072.16] out
[9072.16 → 9073.00] nice
[9073.00 → 9074.24] this is based
[9074.24 → 9075.36] on strip halo
[9075.36 → 9076.84] so that is
[9076.84 → 9078.12] that super
[9078.12 → 9079.18] cool
[9079.18 → 9080.90] like CPU GPU
[9080.90 → 9082.16] kind of apple m
[9082.16 → 9083.16] silicon competitor
[9083.16 → 9084.30] from AMD
[9084.30 → 9086.00] that had
[9086.00 → 9086.76] just
[9086.76 → 9088.06] outstanding
[9088.06 → 9088.78] performance
[9088.78 → 9089.20] like I was
[9089.20 → 9089.64] playing black
[9089.64 → 9090.28] myth Kong
[9090.28 → 9091.02] on a tablet
[9091.02 → 9092.36] uh back at i
[9092.36 → 9092.94] think it was
[9092.94 → 9093.50] CES
[9093.50 → 9095.02] um, so there's
[9095.02 → 9095.98] a handful
[9095.98 → 9097.34] of handhelds
[9097.34 → 9097.82] that are coming
[9097.82 → 9098.48] out with the
[9098.48 → 9099.50] dozen AI max
[9099.50 → 9101.02] plus 395
[9101.02 → 9102.06] including the
[9102.06 → 9102.80] IAN neo next
[9102.80 → 9103.24] 2
[9103.24 → 9105.56] um the one x
[9105.56 → 9106.78] player super x
[9106.78 → 9108.28] and i
[9108.28 → 9109.82] think
[9109.82 → 9110.86] there's a third
[9110.86 → 9111.84] one yeah
[9111.84 → 9112.66] another one from
[9112.66 → 9114.26] God the win
[9114.26 → 9115.88] 5 now there's
[9115.88 → 9116.58] a couple of
[9116.58 → 9117.12] things that are
[9117.12 → 9118.00] sort of noteworthy
[9118.00 → 9120.22] here I love
[9120.22 → 9121.32] this the God
[9121.32 → 9121.94] one check this
[9121.94 → 9123.38] out uh
[9123.38 → 9125.12] has an external
[9125.12 → 9126.82] swappable battery
[9126.82 → 9128.58] whoa
[9128.58 → 9130.10] is that incredible
[9130.10 → 9130.70] or what
[9130.70 → 9132.28] is that just a
[9132.28 → 9132.84] battery bank
[9132.84 → 9133.30] that's just
[9133.30 → 9133.62] mounted
[9133.62 → 9134.48] I mean it seems
[9134.48 → 9135.12] like basically
[9135.12 → 9135.94] but no not
[9135.94 → 9136.28] quite
[9136.28 → 9137.56] why not quite
[9137.56 → 9138.90] because it's
[9138.90 → 9140.20] like it's
[9140.20 → 9140.60] like their
[9140.60 → 9141.36] thing like it's
[9141.36 → 9141.80] not just a
[9141.80 → 9143.22] cable like
[9143.22 → 9144.16] functionally yes
[9144.16 → 9144.76] yes it's a
[9144.76 → 9145.42] battery it's
[9145.42 → 9146.02] essentially a
[9146.02 → 9147.12] battery bank but
[9147.12 → 9147.86] it's like they're
[9147.86 → 9148.66] like effectively
[9148.66 → 9149.30] like a chi
[9149.30 → 9150.14] charging thing
[9150.14 → 9150.48] like it's
[9150.48 → 9151.56] wireless i
[9151.56 → 9152.30] don't think it's
[9152.30 → 9153.24] wireless the plug
[9153.24 → 9154.06] in the magnetic
[9154.06 → 9154.96] I think so
[9154.96 → 9155.50] that's cool
[9155.50 → 9156.02] yeah so it
[9156.02 → 9156.74] doesn't just
[9156.74 → 9157.92] use an USB
[9157.92 → 9158.70] cable like some
[9158.70 → 9159.22] of the battery
[9159.22 → 9159.88] extenders that
[9159.88 → 9160.34] I've seen for
[9160.34 → 9160.94] the steam deck
[9160.94 → 9161.36] for example
[9161.36 → 9161.82] where it's
[9161.82 → 9162.48] basically just
[9162.48 → 9164.00] literally slotting a
[9164.00 → 9164.64] battery bank in
[9164.64 → 9165.00] and then just
[9165.00 → 9165.66] running a cable
[9165.66 → 9168.08] um so
[9168.08 → 9170.20] flipping cool
[9170.20 → 9171.38] and probably
[9171.38 → 9172.98] necessary given
[9172.98 → 9173.92] the power
[9173.92 → 9174.96] requirements of
[9174.96 → 9176.12] this chip so
[9176.12 → 9177.32] here's a little
[9177.32 → 9178.60] comparison here
[9178.60 → 9179.56] between the God
[9179.56 → 9180.42] win 5 and the
[9180.42 → 9181.98] steam deck um
[9181.98 → 9182.96] this is from my
[9182.96 → 9183.52] probably video
[9183.52 → 9184.54] cards yeah this
[9184.54 → 9185.00] is from video
[9185.00 → 9186.22] cards where they
[9186.22 → 9187.04] show yeah steam
[9187.04 → 9188.54] deck 15 watts and
[9188.54 → 9190.26] many people unless
[9190.26 → 9190.74] you're running very
[9190.74 → 9191.56] demanding games probably
[9191.56 → 9192.30] wouldn't want to run
[9192.30 → 9193.10] it at that because
[9193.10 → 9193.88] the battery life kind
[9193.88 → 9195.26] of sucks strict
[9195.26 → 9200.60] halo 45 to 75
[9200.60 → 9202.34] watts of course
[9202.34 → 9202.78] you get a lot
[9202.78 → 9203.38] more performance
[9203.38 → 9204.52] instead of 8 c
[9204.52 → 9205.30] use on the GPU
[9205.30 → 9206.12] you get a whopping
[9206.12 → 9208.84] 40 which is a
[9208.84 → 9211.88] lot also a whopping
[9211.88 → 9213.22] up to 128 gigs
[9213.22 → 9214.26] of later 5x
[9214.26 → 9215.98] 8 000 mega
[9215.98 → 9216.66] transfers per
[9216.66 → 9217.06] second
[9217.06 → 9220.60] very nice ever
[9220.60 → 9221.24] since I saw that
[9221.24 → 9222.06] thing I was like
[9222.06 → 9222.90] oh that looks
[9222.90 → 9223.72] super cool
[9223.72 → 9224.96] uh it would be
[9224.96 → 9225.94] amazing in like a
[9225.94 → 9226.98] handheld and then i
[9226.98 → 9227.70] chatted with some
[9227.70 → 9228.24] people who know
[9228.24 → 9228.76] about you know
[9228.76 → 9229.38] handhelds and they
[9229.38 → 9229.98] were like ah it's
[9229.98 → 9230.48] probably not that
[9230.48 → 9232.16] practical because the
[9232.16 → 9232.88] performance really
[9232.88 → 9233.76] falls off a cliff at
[9233.76 → 9235.42] lower power profiles
[9235.42 → 9236.54] but it looks like they
[9236.54 → 9237.50] decided to just not
[9237.50 → 9238.54] lower power profile
[9238.54 → 9241.60] one x player put an
[9241.60 → 9242.88] 83 and a half watt
[9242.88 → 9243.82] hour battery in their
[9243.82 → 9245.66] handheld that is a
[9245.66 → 9246.94] freaking huge battery
[9246.94 → 9251.40] sounds amazing in other
[9251.40 → 9254.14] news mini SSD is coming
[9254.14 → 9257.40] to dethrone micro SD
[9257.40 → 9260.76] this looks super cool
[9260.76 → 9263.66] it's from biwin tech and
[9263.66 → 9265.46] as far as I can tell this
[9265.46 → 9267.92] is not an actual standard
[9267.92 → 9269.62] yet in the industry or
[9269.62 → 9272.10] anything but look at this
[9272.10 → 9273.34] thing that's what's
[9273.34 → 9275.34] what's going to do
[9275.34 → 9276.50] people are going to lose
[9276.50 → 9278.60] those it's hilarious they
[9278.60 → 9279.88] must be they must be
[9279.88 → 9281.28] the least American people
[9281.28 → 9283.40] ever to think that anyone
[9283.40 → 9286.26] in America like actually
[9286.26 → 9287.82] uses a one dollar coin
[9287.82 → 9289.56] yeah like it technically
[9289.56 → 9291.26] yeah I think it exists but
[9291.26 → 9294.96] like what that's hilarious
[9294.96 → 9298.10] um it's like the kind of thing
[9298.10 → 9299.24] that you google, and you've
[9299.24 → 9300.36] never been to America
[9300.36 → 9301.98] uh anyway the point is
[9301.98 → 9304.78] mini SSD it uses uh PCIE
[9304.78 → 9306.84] I believe it uses two gen
[9306.84 → 9309.62] four lanes yeah PCIE 4.0
[9309.62 → 9313.10] by two to do up to 3700
[9313.10 → 9314.02] megabytes per second
[9314.02 → 9315.78] sequential reads in that
[9315.78 → 9318.24] form factor uh let me see
[9318.24 → 9319.16] do they have anything else
[9319.16 → 9320.32] for scale oh bloody hell
[9320.32 → 9322.02] well whatever the point is
[9322.02 → 9323.28] that it's really
[9323.28 → 9324.70] freaking small and I would
[9324.70 → 9325.64] actually love to see this
[9325.64 → 9327.80] take off I think I have
[9327.80 → 9329.64] some concerns I don't
[9329.64 → 9330.24] know what we're going to
[9330.24 → 9334.10] do about cooling um there's
[9334.10 → 9335.70] the power requirements of
[9335.70 → 9337.30] running PCIE lanes versus
[9337.30 → 9340.68] the much more power hippy um
[9340.68 → 9342.58] micro SD like there's
[9342.58 → 9343.92] there's definitely concerns
[9343.92 → 9345.96] but if this could be
[9345.96 → 9348.00] implemented in like phones
[9348.00 → 9349.30] for instance we might see a
[9349.30 → 9351.36] return to expandable storage
[9351.36 → 9353.24] one hold on I'm going
[9353.24 → 9353.82] somewhere with this
[9353.82 → 9356.46] so you haven't had the
[9356.46 → 9357.86] conversations I've had I'm
[9357.86 → 9358.70] going somewhere with this
[9358.70 → 9360.90] all right um one of the
[9360.90 → 9362.62] conversations that I had
[9362.62 → 9364.06] around why one of the
[9364.06 → 9365.76] reasons why external storage
[9365.76 → 9366.36] has made its way
[9366.36 → 9369.08] particularly specifically out
[9369.08 → 9371.40] of high-end devices is that
[9371.40 → 9373.56] there is concern and whether
[9373.56 → 9374.94] the concern is valid or not
[9374.94 → 9376.10] that's a different
[9376.10 → 9377.60] conversation sure but there
[9377.60 → 9381.30] is concern among executives at
[9381.30 → 9383.50] at least one company that makes
[9383.50 → 9385.98] high-end and low-end phones the
[9385.98 → 9387.60] low-end of which have expandable
[9387.60 → 9389.06] storage and the high-end of
[9389.06 → 9391.28] which do not that having
[9391.28 → 9393.18] expandable storage that is low
[9393.18 → 9395.20] performance and low reliability
[9395.20 → 9397.92] could reflect poorly on the
[9397.92 → 9399.40] experience of using the high-end
[9399.40 → 9400.82] device and therefore their brand
[9400.82 → 9403.30] that is at least one of the
[9403.30 → 9405.18] reasons that seem plausible
[9405.18 → 9407.48] enough that I have heard for why
[9407.48 → 9409.14] expandable storage was ultimately
[9409.14 → 9411.02] removed from at least one company's
[9411.02 → 9414.56] high-end devices it blows but it
[9414.56 → 9417.86] sounds pretty darn plausible if
[9417.86 → 9419.14] you are familiar with sort of
[9419.14 → 9422.62] corporate logic if it could be
[9422.62 → 9423.90] high performance I could
[9423.90 → 9426.38] potentially see that decision being
[9426.38 → 9428.28] reversed if it could be only high
[9428.28 → 9431.48] performance and if it was mini
[9431.48 → 9433.26] SSD then it seems like it would be
[9433.26 → 9435.12] I could see I could see it
[9435.12 → 9436.04] happening I'm just saying like
[9436.04 → 9437.86] that's that it would be important
[9437.86 → 9441.34] in this line of logic that it
[9441.34 → 9442.64] couldn't have the potential to be
[9442.64 → 9444.98] bad and I think that would be super
[9444.98 → 9447.78] cool I have major questions about
[9447.78 → 9450.70] cooling like I said in that tiny
[9450.70 → 9452.54] form factor I mean we all saw what
[9452.54 → 9454.96] happened with even micro SD and
[9454.96 → 9456.80] there being potential thermal issues
[9456.80 → 9459.00] or you know whatever it was exactly
[9459.00 → 9461.04] that happened with the uh with the
[9461.04 → 9465.98] original rogue ally um but overall I support
[9465.98 → 9469.42] a more PCIE connected NVMe future
[9469.42 → 9474.08] um AOL is ending dial-up internet
[9474.08 → 9476.90] service in September 34 years after its
[9476.90 → 9477.24] debut
[9477.24 → 9481.76] that's right AOL shield browser and AOL
[9481.76 → 9485.06] dialler software are also getting killed
[9485.06 → 9487.86] off our discussion question from Nicholas
[9487.86 → 9490.98] can you do the modem handshake noise
[9490.98 → 9492.10] from memory
[9492.10 → 9498.06] don't think perfectly sort of I think
[9498.06 → 9511.92] let's play it and see how close we got
[9511.92 → 9516.46] you're playing audio currently I know oh
[9516.46 → 9516.88] yes
[9516.88 → 9518.38] one moment please
[9518.38 → 9520.54] there you go
[9520.54 → 9523.14] okay we're ready yep okay let's see how
[9523.14 → 9523.64] close we got
[9523.64 → 9530.48] we all forgot the dialling yep
[9530.48 → 9537.04] oh I forgot the b
[9537.04 → 9553.52] we're surfing now boys man that brings
[9553.52 → 9554.50] me back buddy
[9554.50 → 9559.48] boomer good oldies yeah
[9559.48 → 9562.52] wow play that on the radio I like when i
[9562.52 → 9565.48] I preferred when things were chunky be my
[9565.48 → 9567.40] zoo town in float plane chat says I've
[9567.40 → 9569.24] got goosebumps at the moment
[9569.24 → 9571.62] we don't feed our computers and don't
[9571.62 → 9574.26] pick up the phone says DJ spark they
[9574.26 → 9575.48] don't have any mouths
[9575.48 → 9578.40] we took away their mouths the computer
[9578.40 → 9579.98] not having a mouth is sad
[9579.98 → 9583.00] see you later dial up I miss physical
[9583.00 → 9583.32] media
[9583.32 → 9586.80] it made me curious what accessing the
[9586.80 → 9588.34] modern internet would look like with
[9588.34 → 9589.78] dial-up so we're thinking of maybe
[9589.78 → 9591.50] getting a dial-up service and like trying
[9591.50 → 9593.64] to browse the internet just for a LTT video
[9593.64 → 9595.72] I mean there's apparently like a million
[9595.72 → 9597.48] Americans that are still on dial-up so
[9597.48 → 9600.50] they must be able to do something with
[9600.50 → 9600.74] it
[9600.74 → 9604.86] what I don't know email maybe like
[9604.86 → 9605.48] maybe
[9605.48 → 9608.02] oh I could do email all right well we'll
[9608.02 → 9608.28] see
[9608.28 → 9610.46] you can do email for sure in other news
[9610.46 → 9614.92] intel's confusing series 2 CPU brand is a
[9614.92 → 9617.82] massive step backwards intel series 1
[9617.82 → 9619.94] rebranding started in 2023 on mobile
[9619.94 → 9622.98] devices with core and core ultra core
[9622.98 → 9625.50] ultra was meteor lake with neural
[9625.50 → 9627.40] processors and better power efficiency
[9627.40 → 9630.92] and core non-ultra was raptor lake with
[9630.92 → 9635.32] core 3 core 5 core 7 but no 9 in 2024
[9635.32 → 9639.28] the core i9 14900 he launched causing
[9639.28 → 9641.02] confusion because all of a sudden
[9641.02 → 9644.08] lowercase i and the 9 were back
[9644.08 → 9646.88] you can't call it core ultra because
[9646.88 → 9648.82] there's no CPU you can't call it core
[9648.82 → 9651.44] because there is no core 9 but hey they
[9651.44 → 9652.06] did it anyway
[9652.06 → 9656.52] then series 2 launched in September 2024
[9656.52 → 9660.00] this is lunar lake marketing mentioned
[9660.00 → 9663.08] CPUs and battery life improvements except
[9663.08 → 9667.08] that series 2 now also includes raptor
[9667.08 → 9669.88] lake and arrow lake which is causing even
[9669.88 → 9670.58] more confusion
[9670.58 → 9673.74] the pc world article brings up the alienware
[9673.74 → 9678.04] 16x aurora laptop with the series 2 intel
[9678.04 → 9679.74] core 7 240h
[9679.74 → 9685.08] this is a raptor lake chip with no CPU
[9685.08 → 9689.84] okay, but you can get the same laptop with
[9689.84 → 9696.10] an intel series 2 core ultra 9 275hx which is
[9696.10 → 9700.52] arrow lake not lunar lake and yes has a CPU
[9700.52 → 9708.44] um so anyone who watched just for the early
[9708.44 → 9711.10] marketing cycle on series 2 and then
[9711.10 → 9713.38] stopped paying attention later may not
[9713.38 → 9715.92] understand that series 2 no longer
[9715.92 → 9719.28] strictly means lunar lake architecture and
[9719.28 → 9722.84] CPUs it just means whatever the f**k we
[9722.84 → 9725.74] want to put in it is could be raptor lake
[9725.74 → 9729.10] it could be arrow lake it might have a CPU
[9729.10 → 9759.08] it might not well ultra still means CPU I guess as far as I can tell but if there are no rules then how do I trust the rules it's like they took all the crappy things that AMD did in the mobile space and all the crappy things that NVIDIA has done and all the crappy things that intel has ever done with confusing branding and put them all together I just don't know how to deal with this anymore
[9759.10 → 9763.80] I don't think there's any solving their naming scheme at this point to be honest
[9763.80 → 9772.10] like i it's they've they've come close multiple times and then just bailed so like I don't think they're ever going to really commit to anything
[9772.10 → 9773.56] well they clearly don't want to
[9773.56 → 9778.80] the confusion is it's a feature not a bug at this point
[9778.80 → 9783.76] I hear you when they're like winning
[9783.76 → 9788.82] doesn't that become like not true when you're losing though
[9788.82 → 9790.88] I think it's still a feature
[9790.88 → 9794.26] maybe they think it's keeping them from losing worse
[9794.26 → 9796.92] maybe I feel like that can't be true
[9796.92 → 9800.12] because like series two it's like man how do we
[9800.12 → 9802.62] okay
[9802.62 → 9806.52] should I be
[9806.52 → 9810.66] ah see this isn't quite a parallel
[9810.66 → 9813.74] so what I was going to say was should I be upset when I go to
[9813.74 → 9815.46] a ford dealership
[9815.46 → 9816.46] and
[9816.46 → 9818.26] all the cars on the lot
[9818.26 → 9818.98] say
[9818.98 → 9820.18] 2025
[9820.18 → 9821.18] 2025
[9821.18 → 9823.94] but some of them are an all new model year 2025
[9823.94 → 9825.98] and some of them are
[9825.98 → 9828.48] two years into the cycle with a facelift
[9828.48 → 9835.00] and some of them are four are three years in and probably going to be refreshed in like four months when the 2026 hits the lot
[9835.00 → 9838.74] is it any worse than that
[9838.74 → 9842.02] car naming is particularly kind of bad
[9842.02 → 9843.10] yeah I don't know
[9843.10 → 9844.32] that one's tough
[9844.32 → 9850.10] like its super annoying to me when you can literally purchase a
[9850.10 → 9854.60] I bet you within three months you could purchase a 2026 vehicle
[9854.60 → 9855.20] well yeah
[9855.20 → 9856.00] and it's like
[9856.00 → 9856.24] yeah
[9856.24 → 9860.26] imperator says cars with a model year that's a future year is an abomination
[9860.26 → 9860.78] yeah
[9860.78 → 9863.60] I don't even mind the iOS naming
[9863.60 → 9864.76] he'll
[9864.76 → 9866.08] he'll use some
[9866.08 → 9867.72] it's just the year
[9867.72 → 9870.02] yeah they changed from numbering
[9870.02 → 9871.20] the OS
[9871.20 → 9873.44] are they only releasing one a year
[9873.44 → 9874.58] well
[9874.58 → 9876.28] they are only releasing one a year
[9876.28 → 9877.28] so far
[9877.28 → 9877.88] I mean who knows
[9877.88 → 9878.62] things might change
[9878.62 → 9880.26] but they are releasing it
[9880.26 → 9881.66] so when they announce it
[9881.66 → 9882.76] it's the next year
[9882.76 → 9884.38] but I actually don't mind that
[9884.38 → 9885.88] because by the time it's actually
[9885.88 → 9887.28] if when it comes out
[9887.28 → 9887.92] it's that year
[9887.92 → 9888.46] then who cares
[9888.46 → 9889.26] that's totally fine
[9889.26 → 9890.00] it'll be the
[9890.00 → 9893.10] I don't think even that's necessarily going to be quite right
[9893.10 → 9893.74] but it'll be
[9893.74 → 9896.84] the year of when most people are using it mostly in that year
[9896.84 → 9898.98] so
[9898.98 → 9900.68] yeah
[9900.68 → 9902.84] iOS 26 in September
[9902.84 → 9903.80] yeah
[9903.80 → 9905.32] it helps that they're not calling it
[9905.32 → 9906.18] 2026
[9906.18 → 9907.04] yes
[9907.04 → 9909.00] at least there's a minor amount of abstraction
[9909.00 → 9910.94] there is some plausible deniability
[9910.94 → 9912.64] that seems fine to me to be honest
[9912.64 → 9915.08] so it's like fairly easy to track
[9915.08 → 9916.30] but not necessarily perfect
[9916.30 → 9917.56] it's alright
[9917.56 → 9918.80] type says
[9918.80 → 9920.40] I just look at it as a fiscal year
[9920.40 → 9921.70] welcome to development timelines
[9921.70 → 9922.52] yeah
[9922.52 → 9926.54] name them after Stargate
[9926.54 → 9927.24] says amnesics
[9927.24 → 9929.04] nobody ever really knew how that worked anyway
[9929.04 → 9931.56] that's fair
[9931.56 → 9932.72] meanwhile
[9932.72 → 9933.38] Hyundai
[9933.38 → 9934.40] speaking of cars
[9934.40 → 9935.28] wants to
[9935.28 → 9936.28] you to pay
[9936.28 → 9937.62] to fix their security issue
[9937.62 → 9940.62] after a rise in carjackings in the UK
[9940.62 → 9941.72] where thieves use
[9941.72 → 9943.92] Game Boy like devices
[9943.92 → 9945.94] to easily crack the security of
[9945.94 → 9947.38] KIA genesis and Hyundai
[9947.38 → 9948.66] and more cars
[9948.66 → 9950.90] Hyundai is offering a paid
[9950.90 → 9952.58] 49 pound
[9952.58 → 9954.32] so about 65 us dollar
[9954.32 → 9956.14] optional security upgrade
[9956.14 → 9956.88] that includes
[9956.88 → 9958.42] improved software
[9958.42 → 9959.58] and hardware components
[9959.58 → 9960.84] to help consumers
[9960.84 → 9961.94] protect their vehicles
[9961.94 → 9965.80] the quick hack works
[9965.80 → 9966.98] by the thief
[9966.98 → 9968.48] first pulling on the car's handles
[9968.48 → 9970.36] then this handheld device
[9970.36 → 9971.58] Game Boy like device
[9971.58 → 9973.90] what the heck does a Game Boy like device mean
[9973.90 → 9974.68] intercepts
[9974.68 → 9976.00] just the form factor
[9976.00 → 9978.30] intercepts the signal the car sends out
[9978.30 → 9979.90] and cracks the security algorithm
[9979.90 → 9982.02] then the device sends back
[9982.02 → 9984.62] a tricked signal to make the car think the device is a legitimate key
[9984.62 → 9987.08] rinse and repeat with the start car button
[9987.08 → 9988.78] discussion question
[9988.78 → 9992.04] shouldn't corporations be made responsible for their own failures
[9992.04 → 9992.90] yeah
[9992.90 → 9999.14] why do you think Hyundai isn't eating the cost of the security
[9999.14 → 10002.16] seems like a small cost for such large reputational damage
[10002.16 → 10003.82] super tough though
[10003.82 → 10006.82] oh man that's really tough
[10006.82 → 10008.12] because where do you draw the line on that
[10008.12 → 10010.22] and if you draw a line there
[10010.22 → 10013.18] you immediately crush every small company ever
[10013.18 → 10014.62] um
[10014.62 → 10016.28] but Hyundai isn't a small company
[10016.28 → 10016.78] for sure
[10016.78 → 10018.18] and it's not like there isn't a precedent
[10018.18 → 10020.06] do you do a revenue minimum or something
[10020.06 → 10022.42] yeah like the EU has different rules
[10022.42 → 10024.52] for online platforms
[10024.52 → 10026.26] that have many users
[10026.26 → 10027.50] versus very small ones
[10027.50 → 10031.12] apparently these tools are
[10031.12 → 10031.72] are
[10031.72 → 10034.20] quite literally
[10034.20 → 10037.96] Game Boy housings
[10037.96 → 10040.92] you can go to mine
[10040.92 → 10041.22] it's
[10041.22 → 10041.68] yeah
[10041.68 → 10042.82] there you go
[10042.82 → 10044.50] you have to pause it mans
[10044.50 → 10045.72] no that's fine
[10045.72 → 10046.38] they're seeing it
[10046.38 → 10046.70] alright
[10046.70 → 10049.92] alright I think it's time for after dark
[10049.92 → 10050.42] Dan
[10050.42 → 10051.14] want to hit it?
[10051.54 → 10051.66] sure
[10051.66 → 10053.56] I'm gonna
[10053.56 → 10054.04] I'm gonna
[10054.04 → 10055.56] take us off
[10055.56 → 10056.74] for a moment
[10056.74 → 10057.62] before we
[10057.62 → 10058.72] you can keep going
[10058.72 → 10059.62] do after dark stuff
[10059.62 → 10059.92] but
[10059.92 → 10062.04] before we start actually answering merch messages
[10062.04 → 10064.80] I am so tired
[10064.80 → 10066.04] why are you so tired?
[10066.04 → 10067.38] we started
[10067.38 → 10068.64] a thing
[10068.64 → 10069.50] at the company
[10069.50 → 10070.80] what did it end up being called?
[10071.32 → 10072.02] I don't remember
[10072.02 → 10072.98] but we had like
[10072.98 → 10074.10] summer Fridays
[10074.10 → 10074.78] yeah
[10074.78 → 10076.30] so most people
[10076.30 → 10077.24] kind of pieced
[10077.24 → 10077.88] at around
[10077.88 → 10079.34] a little after lunch today
[10079.34 → 10079.90] yeah
[10079.90 → 10080.54] um
[10080.54 → 10081.28] so we're doing like
[10081.28 → 10082.72] four Fridays
[10082.72 → 10084.48] at toward the end of the summer
[10084.48 → 10085.40] where it's kind of like
[10085.40 → 10087.08] optional work afternoon Friday
[10087.08 → 10087.56] yeah
[10087.56 → 10088.66] I tried to
[10088.66 → 10089.42] kind of like a recharge
[10089.42 → 10090.60] I was hoping we could call it
[10090.60 → 10091.32] awesome August
[10091.32 → 10093.20] but then we had to delay it a week
[10093.20 → 10093.66] yeah
[10093.66 → 10094.74] and it didn't work anymore
[10094.74 → 10094.98] but
[10094.98 → 10097.20] I decided to
[10097.20 → 10098.96] I had a meeting that was going to spill over
[10098.96 → 10101.00] and it was with a person that I
[10101.00 → 10102.38] go to the gym with
[10102.38 → 10103.36] so
[10103.36 → 10104.70] they proposed
[10104.70 → 10106.56] because I had to skip
[10106.56 → 10107.50] gym last night
[10107.50 → 10107.84] because
[10107.84 → 10108.82] Emma's cousins were here
[10108.82 → 10109.42] stuff like that
[10109.42 → 10109.74] sure
[10109.74 → 10110.10] um
[10110.10 → 10110.68] so they proposed
[10110.68 → 10111.54] hey what if we do it
[10111.54 → 10112.22] in that like
[10112.22 → 10113.24] kind of void time
[10113.24 → 10113.64] oh yeah
[10113.64 → 10114.26] and I was like
[10114.26 → 10114.72] oh sweet
[10114.72 → 10115.34] cool yeah
[10115.34 → 10116.32] so I went to the gym
[10116.32 → 10117.20] before when
[10117.20 → 10117.90] that was stupid
[10117.90 → 10120.34] and I always go to the gym
[10120.34 → 10121.36] after work
[10121.36 → 10122.70] and then stay up for like
[10122.70 → 10123.38] a couple of hours
[10123.38 → 10124.06] and then go to sleep
[10124.06 → 10124.52] right
[10124.52 → 10125.58] so I think my body's like
[10125.58 → 10126.06] alright
[10126.06 → 10128.44] it's bedtime
[10128.44 → 10131.48] because I was doing
[10131.48 → 10132.46] completely fine
[10132.46 → 10133.04] and then like
[10133.04 → 10133.82] probably like
[10133.82 → 10134.74] 20–30 minutes ago
[10134.74 → 10135.76] I just hit a wall
[10135.76 → 10138.14] so I'm tired
[10138.14 → 10139.86] because I was on vacation
[10139.86 → 10140.38] for
[10140.38 → 10141.80] a couple of weeks
[10141.80 → 10143.14] and then I was supposed
[10143.14 → 10144.00] to be off
[10144.00 → 10145.40] this week
[10145.40 → 10146.28] uh
[10146.28 → 10147.40] but I wasn't
[10147.40 → 10148.46] because I might need
[10148.46 → 10149.30] to take some days
[10149.30 → 10150.38] a week or two
[10150.38 → 10150.84] from now
[10150.84 → 10151.82] and I figured
[10151.82 → 10152.64] production would
[10152.64 → 10153.54] absolutely lose
[10153.54 → 10154.30] their minds
[10154.30 → 10155.80] if I took two weeks
[10155.80 → 10156.22] off
[10156.22 → 10158.18] and then immediately
[10158.18 → 10159.52] called in a couple
[10159.52 → 10160.26] flex days
[10160.26 → 10160.90] yeah
[10160.90 → 10161.82] so I
[10161.82 → 10163.12] so I came back
[10163.12 → 10164.08] Thursday and Friday
[10164.08 → 10164.66] this week
[10164.66 → 10165.42] for the two days
[10165.42 → 10166.08] that I'm going to take
[10166.08 → 10166.82] off in the future
[10166.82 → 10168.42] and um
[10168.42 → 10170.76] my natural cycle
[10170.76 → 10172.44] is probably sleeping
[10172.44 → 10173.28] anywhere from around
[10173.28 → 10174.98] 3.30 to 4 in the morning
[10174.98 → 10176.48] and when I'm on vacation
[10176.48 → 10177.50] I tend to fall
[10177.50 → 10178.64] into my natural cycle
[10178.64 → 10179.50] uh
[10179.50 → 10180.46] my kids aren't in school
[10180.46 → 10181.86] so there's absolutely
[10181.86 → 10182.64] no reason for me
[10182.64 → 10183.04] to be awake
[10183.04 → 10184.04] before about noon
[10184.04 → 10185.00] which is when my brain
[10185.00 → 10185.90] turns on anyway
[10185.90 → 10187.06] even when I do have
[10187.06 → 10188.04] to wake up
[10188.04 → 10189.04] and be moving
[10189.04 → 10189.70] around earlier
[10189.70 → 10190.00] yeah
[10190.00 → 10190.68] um
[10190.68 → 10192.20] so I switched over
[10192.20 → 10194.54] on Thursday morning
[10194.54 → 10195.94] and I basically
[10195.94 → 10197.28] have functionally
[10197.28 → 10199.84] like not slept
[10199.84 → 10200.78] because I can't sleep
[10200.78 → 10201.34] until late
[10201.34 → 10202.18] because I'm way off
[10202.18 → 10202.92] cycle right now
[10202.92 → 10203.92] um
[10203.92 → 10205.96] so I
[10205.96 → 10206.88] used my
[10206.88 → 10207.80] Friday afternoon
[10207.80 → 10208.74] to
[10208.74 → 10210.34] finally be able
[10210.34 → 10211.08] to actually
[10211.08 → 10212.36] try to focus
[10212.36 → 10212.96] any energy
[10212.96 → 10213.52] at my work
[10213.52 → 10214.10] and get anything
[10214.10 → 10214.52] done
[10214.52 → 10215.58] without anybody
[10215.58 → 10216.18] interrupting me
[10216.18 → 10216.56] it was actually
[10216.56 → 10217.06] really nice
[10217.06 → 10218.34] this is
[10218.34 → 10219.68] I quite enjoyed it
[10219.68 → 10220.22] this is why
[10220.22 → 10220.88] I protect some
[10220.88 → 10221.24] of my work
[10221.24 → 10221.86] from home time
[10221.86 → 10223.10] mmm
[10223.10 → 10224.00] it's like
[10224.00 → 10225.78] actually dramatically
[10225.78 → 10226.60] more productive
[10226.60 → 10226.94] for me
[10226.94 → 10227.48] I know it's not
[10227.48 → 10228.24] true for everybody
[10228.24 → 10228.82] blah blah blah blah
[10228.82 → 10229.40] I'm not trying
[10229.40 → 10229.74] to whatever
[10229.74 → 10230.46] for me, it's
[10230.46 → 10231.06] it's very helpful
[10231.06 → 10232.12] I like the mix
[10232.12 → 10233.16] I like coming
[10233.16 → 10233.82] into the office
[10233.82 → 10234.66] sometimes
[10234.66 → 10236.08] and I like not
[10236.08 → 10236.92] coming into the office
[10236.92 → 10238.00] sometimes
[10238.00 → 10239.68] it works
[10239.68 → 10240.18] works well
[10240.18 → 10240.58] for me
[10240.58 → 10241.54] um
[10241.54 → 10243.16] I had something
[10243.16 → 10243.80] else to say here
[10243.80 → 10244.12] but I don't know
[10244.12 → 10244.50] what it was
[10244.50 → 10246.52] it's probably fine
[10246.52 → 10247.78] cool
[10247.78 → 10248.56] anyway
[10248.56 → 10249.40] Dan hit us
[10249.40 → 10251.94] sure thing
[10251.94 → 10252.66] we've got a few
[10252.66 → 10253.06] here
[10253.06 → 10253.90] hi
[10253.90 → 10254.58] DLL
[10254.58 → 10255.82] if LTT
[10255.82 → 10256.92] was to cease
[10256.92 → 10257.72] to exist
[10257.72 → 10258.56] how would you
[10258.56 → 10259.46] handle the forum
[10259.46 → 10259.98] and other
[10259.98 → 10261.52] community resources
[10261.52 → 10262.18] differently from
[10262.18 → 10262.60] NCI
[10262.60 → 10264.98] oh man
[10264.98 → 10265.84] the forum's a good
[10265.84 → 10266.94] question because
[10266.94 → 10268.20] my initial
[10268.20 → 10269.70] sort of gut
[10269.70 → 10271.28] instinct
[10271.28 → 10272.60] would be to say
[10272.60 → 10273.34] like oh yeah
[10273.34 → 10274.26] we would just
[10274.26 → 10275.06] um
[10275.06 → 10275.68] you know
[10275.68 → 10276.06] like
[10276.06 → 10277.70] allow
[10277.70 → 10278.36] somebody
[10278.36 → 10279.42] allow it to continue
[10279.42 → 10280.20] there are big
[10280.20 → 10281.26] issues with that
[10281.26 → 10281.72] but there are
[10281.72 → 10283.10] major privacy
[10283.10 → 10284.78] issues
[10284.78 → 10285.92] around us
[10285.92 → 10287.20] leaving anyone
[10287.20 → 10288.14] other than us
[10288.14 → 10289.10] as stewards
[10289.10 → 10290.12] of that
[10290.12 → 10291.32] data
[10291.32 → 10292.52] um
[10292.52 → 10293.62] if
[10293.62 → 10294.14] LTT
[10294.14 → 10294.50] were to
[10294.50 → 10294.68] cease
[10294.68 → 10295.46] to exist
[10295.46 → 10296.24] um
[10296.24 → 10297.40] I don't
[10297.40 → 10297.90] think it
[10297.90 → 10298.60] would be
[10298.60 → 10299.98] super expensive
[10299.98 → 10300.70] to just
[10300.70 → 10301.54] keep paying
[10301.54 → 10302.16] for the hosting
[10302.16 → 10302.64] but
[10302.64 → 10303.90] I mean
[10303.90 → 10304.34] it's also
[10304.34 → 10304.88] going to rot
[10304.88 → 10306.98] yeah
[10306.98 → 10307.66] if Morris
[10307.66 → 10308.36] doesn't keep it
[10308.36 → 10309.20] alive or whatever
[10309.20 → 10309.82] yeah
[10309.82 → 10310.58] so there might
[10310.58 → 10311.28] not be even
[10311.28 → 10312.06] much to
[10312.06 → 10312.72] preserve
[10312.72 → 10313.30] at a certain
[10313.30 → 10313.66] point
[10313.66 → 10314.98] I could see
[10314.98 → 10315.50] a situation
[10315.50 → 10315.88] where you
[10315.88 → 10316.42] make like
[10316.42 → 10316.92] the
[10316.92 → 10317.68] the DB
[10317.68 → 10318.12] for all
[10318.12 → 10318.58] the public
[10318.58 → 10319.02] posts
[10319.02 → 10319.80] public
[10319.80 → 10321.10] oh yeah
[10321.10 → 10321.58] that would be
[10321.58 → 10321.88] kind of cool
[10321.88 → 10322.24] because the
[10322.24 → 10323.22] privacy problem
[10323.22 → 10324.46] is the
[10324.46 → 10325.10] the direct
[10325.10 → 10325.42] messages
[10325.42 → 10326.16] yeah
[10326.16 → 10326.76] so you'd
[10326.76 → 10327.18] probably have
[10327.18 → 10327.44] to just
[10327.44 → 10328.14] lose those
[10328.14 → 10329.22] uh
[10329.22 → 10329.62] yeah we could
[10329.62 → 10330.20] just nuke all
[10330.20 → 10331.04] the DMs
[10331.04 → 10331.30] yeah
[10331.30 → 10332.20] okay
[10332.20 → 10333.20] but it's
[10333.20 → 10333.56] not just
[10333.56 → 10333.84] that
[10333.84 → 10334.16] there's a
[10334.16 → 10334.46] lot
[10334.46 → 10335.00] some people
[10335.00 → 10335.54] put a lot
[10335.54 → 10336.04] of personal
[10336.04 → 10336.54] information
[10336.54 → 10336.92] in their
[10336.92 → 10337.46] like user
[10337.46 → 10338.06] profile
[10338.06 → 10338.70] and stuff
[10338.70 → 10340.04] that's
[10340.04 → 10340.46] public
[10340.46 → 10341.04] well
[10341.04 → 10341.88] not all of
[10341.88 → 10342.48] it necessarily
[10342.48 → 10343.26] like people
[10343.26 → 10343.62] put their
[10343.62 → 10344.12] birthdate
[10344.12 → 10344.62] and stuff
[10344.62 → 10346.12] I don't want
[10346.12 → 10346.48] that out
[10346.48 → 10346.84] there
[10346.84 → 10348.60] don't they
[10348.60 → 10349.78] do they
[10349.78 → 10350.22] I think
[10350.22 → 10351.22] so
[10351.22 → 10353.20] right my
[10353.20 → 10353.62] computer's
[10353.62 → 10354.00] why would we
[10354.00 → 10354.46] even collect
[10354.46 → 10354.80] that if it's
[10354.80 → 10355.28] not public
[10355.28 → 10356.16] I don't know
[10356.16 → 10356.60] I guess we
[10356.60 → 10357.00] have stuff
[10357.00 → 10357.36] for the
[10357.36 → 10357.82] payments
[10357.82 → 10358.26] things
[10358.26 → 10359.34] so we'd
[10359.34 → 10359.58] have to
[10359.58 → 10360.08] nuke that
[10360.08 → 10360.64] as well
[10360.64 → 10362.26] if there's
[10362.26 → 10362.62] like user
[10362.62 → 10363.32] profile stuff
[10363.32 → 10363.70] and it's
[10363.70 → 10364.26] not public
[10364.26 → 10364.86] like if I
[10364.86 → 10365.20] click a
[10365.20 → 10365.60] user's
[10365.60 → 10366.12] profile
[10366.12 → 10367.16] oh no
[10367.16 → 10367.52] it looks
[10367.52 → 10367.86] like you
[10367.86 → 10368.28] just kind
[10368.28 → 10368.74] of decide
[10368.74 → 10369.00] what you
[10369.00 → 10369.28] want to
[10369.28 → 10369.56] put in
[10369.56 → 10369.74] there
[10369.74 → 10370.00] yeah
[10370.00 → 10370.62] okay
[10370.62 → 10370.96] yeah
[10370.96 → 10371.36] so any
[10371.36 → 10371.64] payment
[10371.64 → 10372.04] stuff would
[10372.04 → 10372.30] have to
[10372.30 → 10372.54] go
[10372.54 → 10373.26] I don't
[10373.26 → 10373.42] know
[10373.42 → 10373.80] that would
[10373.80 → 10374.20] definitely
[10374.20 → 10374.84] require some
[10374.84 → 10375.56] thought but
[10375.56 → 10376.56] yeah to your
[10376.56 → 10377.34] point it was
[10377.34 → 10378.24] pretty sad for
[10378.24 → 10379.46] me when that
[10379.46 → 10381.18] entire information
[10381.18 → 10382.56] repository just
[10382.56 → 10385.90] disappeared and
[10385.90 → 10387.16] there's no way to
[10387.16 → 10388.02] restore it because as
[10388.02 → 10388.76] far as I can tell it
[10388.76 → 10389.46] was running on some
[10389.46 → 10390.84] Huron in a closet at
[10390.84 → 10391.88] the NCI headquarters
[10391.88 → 10392.50] so like
[10392.50 → 10394.22] I don't know
[10394.22 → 10394.36] I don't know
[10394.36 → 10396.04] yeah because with
[10396.04 → 10396.42] that type of
[10396.42 → 10397.32] form somebody has
[10397.32 → 10397.94] to pay for it
[10397.94 → 10398.78] I wish I had a
[10398.78 → 10399.34] picture of what
[10399.34 → 10400.48] NCI's server room
[10400.48 → 10401.42] looked like because
[10401.42 → 10402.66] they locally hosted
[10402.66 → 10403.60] the site until
[10403.60 → 10407.46] like very close to
[10407.46 → 10408.98] like before I
[10408.98 → 10410.04] left like it was
[10410.04 → 10411.24] crazy it was like a
[10411.24 → 10412.54] bunch of like
[10412.54 → 10413.44] shuttle and soul
[10413.44 → 10414.88] tech like cube
[10414.88 → 10416.86] PCs and like it
[10416.86 → 10417.74] was dude it was
[10417.74 → 10419.00] wild, and it was
[10419.00 → 10419.70] just those like
[10419.70 → 10420.82] metal racks from
[10420.82 → 10422.14] Costco with just
[10422.14 → 10423.24] like computers on
[10423.24 → 10424.02] them looked like
[10424.02 → 10424.90] like a really
[10424.90 → 10425.92] rudimentary mining
[10425.92 → 10427.10] farm anyway did
[10427.10 → 10427.74] you ever see it
[10427.74 → 10429.12] yeah okay you so
[10429.12 → 10429.86] you remember the
[10429.86 → 10430.46] forum was in there
[10430.46 → 10431.86] for a bit oh
[10431.86 → 10432.94] wait the forum was
[10432.94 → 10433.56] in there on a test
[10433.56 → 10434.84] bench for a bit and
[10434.84 → 10435.46] then it was in the
[10435.46 → 10436.36] studio and then it
[10436.36 → 10437.48] was at my well it
[10437.48 → 10438.16] was at my parents
[10438.16 → 10439.28] house so hold on
[10439.28 → 10440.28] where in the
[10440.28 → 10441.42] building was the
[10441.42 → 10441.92] room that you
[10441.92 → 10442.72] remember oh I
[10442.72 → 10443.28] don't remember
[10443.28 → 10445.38] okay go in the
[10445.38 → 10446.16] front door and go
[10446.16 → 10447.12] left or right I
[10447.12 → 10450.64] feel like I
[10450.64 → 10451.48] rarely even went
[10451.48 → 10452.22] in the front door
[10452.22 → 10452.68] which is the
[10452.68 → 10453.16] problem but I
[10453.16 → 10453.48] think it was
[10453.48 → 10455.38] left okay no I
[10455.38 → 10455.78] think that might
[10455.78 → 10456.08] have been a
[10456.08 → 10456.68] different one then
[10456.68 → 10457.80] okay yeah it
[10457.80 → 10459.40] was it was bank
[10459.40 → 10460.52] dude oh it was
[10460.52 → 10461.98] super bank okay
[10461.98 → 10462.80] and I remember the
[10462.80 → 10463.66] shuttles and stuff
[10463.66 → 10464.58] okay then maybe
[10464.58 → 10465.40] maybe you saw it
[10465.40 → 10465.96] then maybe I
[10465.96 → 10466.62] remember the room
[10466.62 → 10467.30] you were describing
[10467.30 → 10468.36] yeah dude it was
[10468.36 → 10469.46] wild I wasn't in it
[10469.46 → 10470.46] often yeah
[10470.46 → 10472.42] yeah

[10534.10 → 10534.70] challenge which you

[10539.16 → 10540.58] saying I also

[10549.74 → 10550.26] supposed to do
[10550.26 → 10551.10] which is so
[10551.10 → 10552.66] less than one of
[10552.66 → 10553.70] the stages in
[10553.70 → 10554.56] Final Fantasy 6
[10554.56 → 10555.32] is that like four

[10560.26 → 10560.92] give you guys a
[10560.92 → 10561.48] bit of an update

[10563.68 → 10567.30] uh okay this is
[10567.30 → 10568.04] confusing I will
[10568.04 → 10568.50] deal with that
[10568.50 → 10570.06] later I am
[10570.06 → 10570.68] not technically
[10570.68 → 10572.56] done, so I have a
[10572.56 → 10573.46] text from the
[10573.46 → 10575.96] motorcycle shop uh
[10575.96 → 10577.60] from earlier today
[10577.60 → 10579.26] did I already give
[10579.26 → 10580.08] the update that I
[10580.08 → 10580.98] accidentally painted
[10580.98 → 10581.52] a bunch of the
[10581.52 → 10582.10] threads on the
[10582.10 → 10582.36] frame
[10582.36 → 10583.30] oh no
[10583.30 → 10587.26] yep did they
[10587.26 → 10588.00] discover that
[10588.00 → 10590.68] yep and did I
[10590.68 → 10591.32] give the update
[10591.32 → 10592.42] that it used a
[10592.42 → 10593.30] bunch of oddball
[10593.30 → 10594.68] sizes that they
[10594.68 → 10595.36] didn't have taps
[10595.36 → 10598.38] for I guess not
[10598.38 → 10603.96] cool so anywho I
[10603.96 → 10606.94] had to source m22
[10606.94 → 10608.24] by one and a half
[10608.24 → 10610.62] pitch m26 by one
[10610.62 → 10611.48] and a half pitch
[10611.48 → 10613.20] and m28 by one
[10613.20 → 10614.06] and a half pitch
[10614.06 → 10616.40] taps and sent
[10616.40 → 10617.68] them to the shop
[10617.68 → 10619.16] and I got
[10619.16 → 10620.50] confirmation today
[10620.50 → 10621.86] at 11 a.m.
[10622.00 → 10622.88] that yes they
[10622.88 → 10624.60] have them so
[10624.60 → 10625.22] that's where we've
[10625.22 → 10625.94] been at for the
[10625.94 → 10626.64] last two weeks
[10626.64 → 10630.00] I doubt that I'm
[10630.00 → 10630.80] riding this summer
[10630.80 → 10632.12] but I will
[10632.12 → 10633.32] definitely ride next
[10633.32 → 10635.80] summer nice I
[10635.80 → 10637.40] also have some
[10637.40 → 10638.14] paint flaking
[10638.14 → 10639.00] around the bottom
[10639.00 → 10640.62] of the gas tank
[10640.62 → 10641.40] because I didn't
[10641.40 → 10642.88] realize how
[10642.88 → 10643.84] important it was to
[10643.84 → 10644.58] get good coverage
[10644.58 → 10645.34] there because it's
[10645.34 → 10646.22] kind of like raw
[10646.22 → 10648.12] and I thought it
[10648.12 → 10648.84] didn't matter because
[10648.84 → 10649.48] I thought there were
[10649.48 → 10650.52] trim pieces that like
[10650.52 → 10651.24] sat in front of it
[10651.24 → 10652.16] because of how raw it
[10652.16 → 10652.72] looked, but that is
[10652.72 → 10653.92] not the case, so I
[10653.92 → 10654.60] kind of have to go
[10654.60 → 10655.68] and sand that down
[10655.68 → 10656.38] and maybe like
[10656.38 → 10657.82] completely redo that
[10657.82 → 10658.78] so I have some tape
[10658.78 → 10660.44] masked off there's
[10660.44 → 10661.28] probably going to be a
[10661.28 → 10662.18] bit of a line, so I
[10662.18 → 10662.80] was thinking of maybe
[10662.80 → 10664.18] doing it black okay
[10664.18 → 10665.60] or something I don't
[10665.60 → 10669.50] know but I just I
[10669.50 → 10670.46] hate this project so
[10670.46 → 10672.40] much, and I realized
[10672.40 → 10673.90] that you were trying
[10673.90 → 10674.64] to be encouraging
[10674.64 → 10675.48] hey now that the
[10675.48 → 10676.26] bike is done what's
[10676.26 → 10676.82] the next big fun
[10676.82 → 10677.72] project it's going to be
[10677.72 → 10678.34] really cool when it's
[10678.34 → 10679.56] done I don't even
[10679.56 → 10680.90] like want a project
[10680.90 → 10683.38] right now, but it's
[10683.38 → 10683.94] going to be very cool
[10683.94 → 10685.80] when it's done what
[10685.80 → 10686.68] will what would be
[10686.68 → 10687.40] what would even be
[10687.40 → 10688.04] something that I would
[10688.04 → 10689.32] even remotely want to
[10689.32 → 10690.48] do I oh I've talked
[10690.48 → 10691.48] about this I want to
[10691.48 → 10694.30] learn casting yeah yeah
[10694.30 → 10695.70] I want I would love
[10695.70 → 10698.46] to like to make something
[10698.46 → 10700.12] out of like silver or
[10700.12 → 10701.20] precious metal that's
[10701.20 → 10702.72] awesome yeah that's
[10702.72 → 10703.68] super cool yeah it's
[10703.68 → 10705.32] too bad they gold every
[10705.32 → 10706.68] time I look at it is
[10706.68 → 10708.44] more expensive yeah so
[10708.44 → 10710.04] maybe gold will be you
[10710.04 → 10710.78] should really do
[10710.78 → 10712.56] even if it's just for
[10712.56 → 10713.22] practicing you should
[10713.22 → 10714.04] do one of those can
[10714.04 → 10715.94] caster things can cast
[10715.94 → 10716.92] like pop can caster
[10716.92 → 10718.02] oh yeah yeah
[10718.02 → 10718.90] yeah those are cool
[10718.90 → 10720.68] that'd be cool as far
[10720.68 → 10721.56] as I know they're the
[10721.56 → 10722.46] like purity is really
[10722.46 → 10724.16] bad and stuff so like
[10724.16 → 10724.94] what you get out of
[10724.94 → 10726.72] it's not usually like
[10726.72 → 10727.58] amazing or anything
[10727.58 → 10730.20] oh okay cool, but it's
[10730.20 → 10731.10] still cool to like
[10731.10 → 10731.72] practice with and
[10731.72 → 10734.72] whatnot yeah I could be
[10734.72 → 10735.34] wrong about that I
[10735.34 → 10735.78] don't know it's been a
[10735.78 → 10736.34] long time since I've
[10736.34 → 10737.20] looked into it not the
[10737.20 → 10737.86] couch kind
[10737.86 → 10741.70] not the controller to
[10741.70 → 10742.06] practice
[10742.06 → 10748.18] oh hey okay I was
[10748.18 → 10749.68] called something cool I
[10749.68 → 10751.08] was called an idiot for
[10751.08 → 10752.32] that controller is it
[10752.32 → 10752.88] worth more than it
[10752.88 → 10753.62] costs to make it at
[10753.62 → 10754.62] this point oh yeah
[10754.62 → 10761.40] get wrecked everybody
[10761.40 → 10761.96] else
[10761.96 → 10766.34] savvy howdy Linus Luke
[10766.34 → 10767.40] and Dan question for
[10767.40 → 10768.86] Luke so how do you
[10768.86 → 10769.78] typically determine the
[10769.78 → 10770.70] backlog for float
[10770.70 → 10771.66] plane curious to hear how
[10771.66 → 10772.16] you manage your
[10772.16 → 10773.08] priorities for such a
[10773.08 → 10774.10] small development team
[10774.10 → 10775.46] hmm yeah incredibly
[10775.46 → 10776.34] small development team
[10776.34 → 10779.18] um it's not easy to be
[10779.18 → 10779.68] honest because the
[10779.68 → 10780.72] backlog is really
[10780.72 → 10783.00] expansive we tend to
[10783.00 → 10790.32] go by oh man how can I
[10790.32 → 10792.46] access it right now
[10792.46 → 10798.50] your QBR no, no no, no no
[10798.50 → 10798.92] oh okay
[10798.92 → 10800.66] task priority
[10800.66 → 10803.18] he sent like a
[10803.18 → 10804.54] summary of
[10804.54 → 10806.64] sort of
[10806.64 → 10808.26] last quarter's
[10808.26 → 10810.02] goals and last quarter
[10810.02 → 10811.04] achieved and next quarter
[10811.04 → 10811.92] goals I thought that's what
[10811.92 → 10812.56] he was talking about
[10812.56 → 10814.94] no there 's's this like
[10814.94 → 10817.44] equation that I like have
[10817.44 → 10818.76] accessible on my like home
[10818.76 → 10819.74] computer which is literally
[10819.74 → 10821.10] just a mathematical
[10821.10 → 10823.72] equation but I don't
[10823.72 → 10825.40] have access to right now
[10825.40 → 10826.56] but there's like a
[10826.56 → 10828.60] basically like benefit to
[10828.60 → 10831.44] the company benefit to the
[10831.44 → 10834.20] users benefit to whatever
[10834.20 → 10836.56] and you put a numerical
[10836.56 → 10837.96] scale onto those different
[10837.96 → 10839.60] things, and then you divide it
[10839.60 → 10840.92] by things like time
[10840.92 → 10843.22] um criticality is something
[10843.22 → 10844.70] on like the positive weighing
[10844.70 → 10847.86] side um like a chance of
[10847.86 → 10848.98] success is something on the
[10848.98 → 10850.18] negative weighing side
[10850.18 → 10852.14] um there's like there's like
[10852.14 → 10853.32] these different factors you
[10853.32 → 10855.16] can do that I have done that
[10855.16 → 10858.30] before um something that we
[10858.30 → 10859.42] were doing for a while there
[10859.42 → 10862.90] was like pushing for sauce plus
[10862.90 → 10863.88] because we were you know
[10863.88 → 10865.60] launching a platform so we had
[10865.60 → 10867.52] to prioritize things that got
[10867.52 → 10870.98] our minimum level of this
[10870.98 → 10873.26] is required for functionality done
[10873.26 → 10876.14] um and now that we're done that
[10876.14 → 10877.56] we're we're taking some time and
[10877.56 → 10878.96] we're looking back at some
[10878.96 → 10880.24] things I've been you know
[10880.24 → 10881.28] telling people from the
[10881.28 → 10885.34] business team and Sammy to uh
[10885.34 → 10887.18] chill on the request for a while
[10887.18 → 10888.40] because we were very focused on
[10888.40 → 10891.76] that uh, and they have waited uh
[10891.76 → 10895.58] so it's time to like to come back to
[10895.58 → 10896.72] them, and you know if they want
[10896.72 → 10898.66] something maybe try to get that
[10898.66 → 10899.54] done for them because they've been
[10899.54 → 10901.60] waiting for a long time um but
[10901.60 → 10902.88] it's its weird because there's a
[10902.88 → 10904.76] lot of pulls there's a lot of
[10904.76 → 10905.76] people pulling there's a lot of
[10905.76 → 10906.34] different people that want
[10906.34 → 10908.84] different things the know the
[10908.84 → 10910.02] the open source people want
[10910.02 → 10913.16] something the leg largest creator
[10913.16 → 10914.96] on any of the platforms group
[10914.96 → 10917.54] wants stuff but then different
[10917.54 → 10918.86] people within leg want different
[10918.86 → 10921.34] things different other creators on
[10921.34 → 10923.16] the float plane side want certain
[10923.16 → 10924.90] things other creators on the open
[10924.90 → 10926.54] sauce side want certain things the
[10926.54 → 10929.46] users want certain things and there
[10929.46 → 10933.96] are three devs um so they should
[10933.96 → 10936.48] type faster honestly they need to
[10936.48 → 10938.42] figure it out if we're not if we're
[10938.42 → 10940.02] not topping over 200 words per minute
[10940.02 → 10942.00] we're going to need to start talking
[10942.00 → 10943.98] about second keyboard um give them
[10943.98 → 10945.88] two keyboards one for their nose
[10945.88 → 10950.06] yeah uh yeah no it's so it comes down
[10950.06 → 10953.62] to like a lot of it at our team size
[10953.62 → 10956.28] comes down to criticality um how
[10956.28 → 10957.86] critically important is this thing
[10957.86 → 10959.62] like something that we really want
[10959.62 → 10962.04] to do is TV apps and there has been
[10962.04 → 10965.12] work done towards that, but it's often
[10965.12 → 10966.78] something that gets paused due to
[10966.78 → 10968.82] criticality oh this other thing is not
[10968.82 → 10973.24] working um someone's uploads from
[10973.24 → 10975.00] somewhere in the world aren't working
[10975.00 → 10978.24] because uh an ISP is having a routing
[10978.24 → 10980.66] war um so now we need to like solve
[10980.66 → 10984.86] this problem or uh x y or z critical
[10984.86 → 10987.14] critical level thing has to be dealt
[10987.14 → 10989.54] with uh, and then we try to we try to
[10989.54 → 10991.42] fit features in there when we can we
[10991.42 → 10993.02] also try to do this thing where like
[10993.02 → 10996.38] you know someone will raise a feature
[10996.38 → 10998.04] as a super critical thing that has to
[10998.04 → 11000.04] be done for whatever reason, and it's
[11000.04 → 11001.96] like okay so we'll do that but then
[11001.96 → 11004.68] we'll like all right so you want that
[11004.68 → 11007.32] feature well cool we're going to find a
[11007.32 → 11008.54] way to make sure that we get some
[11008.54 → 11010.88] maintenance levels in here as a bundle
[11010.88 → 11013.08] of this piece of work that we're doing
[11013.08 → 11015.34] and we're going to make this new tool that
[11015.34 → 11016.58] will make solving this thing in the
[11016.58 → 11018.56] future easier and also solving other
[11018.56 → 11020.50] things easier, and we're going to use that
[11020.50 → 11022.00] for making this thing in the first
[11022.00 → 11024.86] place so like instead of sprint to the
[11024.86 → 11026.24] finish complete that task as soon as
[11026.24 → 11028.38] possible it's like use this task to
[11028.38 → 11029.94] create better foundations for the
[11029.94 → 11032.36] future and solve the problem all at the
[11032.36 → 11034.02] same time right that's one of the ways
[11034.02 → 11037.00] that we've been able to prevent being in
[11037.00 → 11039.46] as bad of a tech debt situation as we
[11039.46 → 11040.86] were in the past yeah i remember that
[11040.86 → 11042.36] year and a half when we basically did
[11042.36 → 11044.48] that dude it was rough that was crazy
[11044.48 → 11047.92] yeah um so to not be there again
[11047.92 → 11050.86] uh there's like a way that we kind of
[11050.86 → 11053.80] try to approach tasking to stop that
[11053.80 → 11056.64] from happening um it's called not making
[11056.64 → 11058.02] technical debt yeah that's a really
[11058.02 → 11059.86] simple statement to make
[11059.86 → 11063.96] a lot harder to do yeah especially when
[11063.96 → 11065.30] you can't control your own technical
[11065.30 → 11067.22] debt this is an interesting thing that i
[11067.22 → 11068.24] don't think everyone necessarily
[11068.24 → 11070.78] really understands um which is like if
[11070.78 → 11073.30] you're if you're working on an embedded
[11073.30 → 11074.72] system that never connects to the
[11074.72 → 11076.74] internet yeah if you're working on a
[11076.74 → 11079.88] controller for a machine, and it's gonna
[11079.88 → 11082.44] be you know up down left right for the
[11082.44 → 11085.24] next 40 years, and it needs to do that you
[11085.24 → 11088.06] probably don't have tech debt yeah but if
[11088.06 → 11089.68] you're working on a web system that's
[11089.68 → 11092.66] interacting with likely hundreds if not
[11092.66 → 11094.18] thousands of other different types of
[11094.18 → 11095.80] web systems and all those other web
[11095.80 → 11097.88] systems are changing and updating and
[11097.88 → 11100.08] evolving and disappearing from existence
[11100.08 → 11102.18] and doing all this kind of stuff all the
[11102.18 → 11106.48] time things just naturally rot yeah and
[11106.48 → 11107.98] if you just leave a certain thing
[11107.98 → 11110.70] alone for a few years entropy end up being
[11110.70 → 11112.50] in a state where a lot of the things that
[11112.50 → 11114.18] it relied on are kind of not working in
[11114.18 → 11115.46] the same way anymore and stuff like that
[11115.46 → 11118.50] and you have to go update it um that's
[11118.50 → 11122.00] why JavaScript sucks, but that's also at the
[11122.00 → 11124.14] same time one of the reasons why JavaScript
[11124.14 → 11127.66] is good because it's like constantly
[11127.66 → 11130.14] growing but that constant growth means
[11130.14 → 11133.64] you need to keep up so it's like it's
[11133.64 → 11137.68] okay good yeah and this is like a fun
[11137.68 → 11139.82] little hint just for float plane
[11139.82 → 11144.80] people is the whole themes which we've
[11144.80 → 11146.46] moved now because we didn't want the fire
[11146.46 → 11148.52] truck and Lamb logos there forever but if
[11148.52 → 11150.90] you click on your let me go here if you
[11150.90 → 11153.54] click on your profile up in the corner you
[11153.54 → 11156.10] can see you know light mode i just flash
[11156.10 → 11158.66] banged everyone dark mode nice and there's
[11158.66 → 11160.86] also bonus themes and in there's the
[11160.86 → 11162.54] watermelon theme and the fire truck theme
[11162.54 → 11166.48] this we made totally yeah guys we totally
[11166.48 → 11169.10] we totally made that just for April fools
[11169.10 → 11173.86] we just made that to be funny haha no that
[11173.86 → 11176.58] was how we figured out how to have this the
[11176.58 → 11180.52] sauce plus theme right and that's how we
[11180.52 → 11183.40] tested it with tons of users thanks
[11183.40 → 11186.80] everyone wicked so like we and that was a
[11186.80 → 11188.86] a total that was Jaden that was a Jaden
[11188.86 → 11190.72] initiative he thought he could do this
[11190.72 → 11192.62] thing and and and that would be a way to
[11192.62 → 11194.94] build the tool and also make a cool thing
[11194.94 → 11196.98] for April fools and also test it and also
[11196.98 → 11198.86] test it and all of these things so you have
[11198.86 → 11200.62] I have this one task I'll find a way to
[11200.62 → 11202.04] make it solve a ton of different problems
[11202.04 → 11204.50] and be awesome all at once um and that's
[11204.50 → 11208.90] been like how we would ideally like to
[11208.90 → 11210.46] approach these types of issues because we
[11210.46 → 11212.42] we do not have the team to keep up with
[11212.42 → 11214.00] and I don't know that anyone does but
[11214.00 → 11215.98] even the huge players, but we don't
[11215.98 → 11217.12] have the team to keep up with every
[11217.12 → 11220.78] request ever made um there are so many
[11220.78 → 11222.54] different things that I really wish we had
[11222.54 → 11225.46] right now yeah like a trial would
[11225.46 → 11229.82] be awesome but someday we will absolutely
[11229.82 → 11231.76] have one someday we will also absolutely
[11231.76 → 11234.20] have a TV app someday um there's
[11234.20 → 11235.88] certain like phone compatibility things
[11235.88 → 11237.50] that I would love to like in certain
[11237.50 → 11239.30] situations picture in picture and like
[11239.30 → 11240.36] background play and all this kind of stuff
[11240.36 → 11242.08] doesn't work perfectly different devices
[11242.08 → 11244.56] iOS android there isn't feature parity
[11244.56 → 11247.26] there I would love to fix that we have a
[11247.26 → 11250.06] part-time contractor person who's been
[11250.06 → 11251.70] helping us with app stuff so we're hoping
[11251.70 → 11253.42] to try to catch up with the app stuff but
[11253.42 → 11255.16] like these things are tough and a lot of
[11255.16 → 11257.20] these companies have multi-hundred multi-thousand
[11257.20 → 11259.90] person teams, and it's its three people
[11259.90 → 11264.08] yeah it's just a few um uh someone asked if
[11264.08 → 11267.78] any of us have a personal 50 90 yet um uh Dan
[11267.78 → 11271.62] said sadly no I actually do i yeah proof i
[11271.62 → 11274.50] took his pre-order ah yeah he pre-ordered
[11274.50 → 11278.68] disinformation no, no it's all good um but
[11278.68 → 11280.60] but you're too just kidding no you weren't
[11280.60 → 11284.28] entirely wrong because while I do have it and
[11284.28 → 11286.22] I've actually had it for about a month now
[11286.22 → 11290.32] it's still in its box because my computer is a
[11290.32 → 11292.82] royal pain in the butt to upgrade because of
[11292.82 → 11294.72] hardline water cooling and being rack mounted
[11294.72 → 11297.34] and cooled by my pool and stuff so I've been
[11297.34 → 11301.08] waiting until I have an excuse until making a
[11301.08 → 11304.10] video gives me an excuse to actually do the
[11304.10 → 11304.56] upgrade
[11304.56 → 11310.30] so I have a 50 90 I have not yet gamed on it
[11310.30 → 11313.42] it could be broken for all I know
[11313.42 → 11319.94] yay pins dll.exe just got myself an
[11319.94 → 11323.20] and Burnie game boy handheld clone what
[11323.20 → 11325.34] games besides Final Fantasy should I get for
[11325.34 → 11325.54] it
[11325.54 → 11329.92] oh uh man yeah what are some really fun
[11329.92 → 11332.08] little like handhelds here let's have a
[11332.08 → 11332.28] look
[11332.28 → 11336.68] oh okay so
[11336.68 → 11342.56] game boy clone is not actually a name uh
[11342.56 → 11344.16] okay it would have been great if you told
[11344.16 → 11346.26] us exactly which device it is because
[11346.26 → 11348.80] that's going to make this a lot tougher
[11348.80 → 11354.14] platformers can't go wrong with platformers
[11354.14 → 11357.28] dude i uh I started playing Super Mario bros 3
[11357.28 → 11358.14] with my son
[11358.14 → 11362.20] nice yeah that's cool it's it totally is
[11362.20 → 11364.50] still awesome platformers age well yeah well
[11364.50 → 11367.32] some of them the physics are kind of
[11367.32 → 11369.78] floaty and kind of crappy compared to like
[11369.78 → 11371.98] what is generally understood to be a more
[11371.98 → 11374.58] modern sort of feel which I think really
[11374.58 → 11376.86] started to solidify with like Super Mario
[11376.86 → 11377.30] world
[11377.30 → 11380.32] okay um yes I do agree with that I was
[11380.32 → 11382.24] going to say Super Mario world physics even when
[11382.24 → 11384.18] they are floaty i kind of like them yeah
[11384.18 → 11386.32] they feel video game appropriate three
[11386.32 → 11390.84] is like still a little uh yeah it's its a
[11390.84 → 11393.76] little it's a little tougher um, but it's
[11393.76 → 11396.90] it's lots of fun um, and he's been having an
[11396.90 → 11398.52] absolute blast with it which I think is
[11398.52 → 11398.96] super cool
[11398.96 → 11403.02] so yeah yeah play platformers uh what
[11403.02 → 11404.56] else what else would you play on an on like
[11404.56 → 11405.22] a game boy clone
[11405.22 → 11415.12] nobody in chat there's no Pokémon games are
[11415.12 → 11420.66] still a thing for a reason so yeah i uh I tried
[11420.66 → 11421.88] giving them to my kids
[11421.88 → 11423.94] didn't like them didn't like them I could
[11423.94 → 11425.96] see that nowadays for sure yeah I feel like a
[11425.96 → 11427.80] lot of it's the nostalgia glasses for those
[11427.80 → 11429.44] games I think are strong enough that they're
[11429.44 → 11430.84] still worth playing for people who played it
[11430.84 → 11433.56] back then but okay, so this is a person new
[11433.56 → 11436.76] to these games crystal says Tetris can't go
[11436.76 → 11439.00] wrong with Tetris if you just want to kill a
[11439.00 → 11442.58] little bit of time for real game boy Tetris is
[11442.58 → 11445.84] fantastic and I find it very annoying that
[11445.84 → 11448.44] it's like impossible to get all the new
[11448.44 → 11451.48] Tetris stuff are like oh it's Tetris but
[11451.48 → 11454.34] with these crazy twists and I'm like no i just
[11454.34 → 11456.34] want Tetris stop
[11456.34 → 11463.86] golden sun wasn't it's not wasn't my
[11463.86 → 11465.68] childhood so it's hard for me to have that
[11465.68 → 11466.58] nostalgia for it
[11466.58 → 11471.24] yeah I'd say I'd say platformers are probably
[11471.24 → 11471.64] your
[11471.64 → 11476.84] oh yeah oh that's right okay so don't feel
[11476.84 → 11479.84] limited to actual games from like big developers
[11479.84 → 11481.80] and publishers uh Sebastian the other
[11481.80 → 11484.34] Sebastian not Linus sebastian from
[11484.34 → 11486.86] creator warehouse uh posted in float plane chat
[11486.86 → 11488.48] there's some amazing room hacks out there where
[11488.48 → 11490.00] people have made entirely new games with old
[11490.00 → 11493.86] assets yeah that's that is a heck of a rabbit
[11493.86 → 11497.48] hole to fall down, but there's a lot out there so
[11497.48 → 11499.10] that'd be something that would be pretty cool to
[11499.10 → 11499.40] explore
[11499.40 → 11503.98] hello when peeps Linus and Luke and maybe Dan
[11503.98 → 11508.24] too I'm not sure I'm planning a trip to Taiwan at the
[11508.24 → 11510.00] moment and would love some tips or recommendations
[11510.00 → 11512.96] for the area specifically Taipei soup dumplings
[11512.96 → 11516.08] get all the soup dumplings kind of soup dumplings
[11516.08 → 11519.32] specifically Taipei limits my suggestions
[11519.32 → 11521.86] you were right I've never been to Taiwan
[11521.86 → 11529.14] there's hold on you have your thing right I do
[11529.14 → 11534.36] he has a thing I do think he like notes I do
[11534.36 → 11542.94] notable things I do like scrap booking so I'll zoom in on Taipei I do a bunch okay a
[11542.94 → 11545.58] lot of these because it's Taipei are going to be restaurants
[11545.58 → 11550.82] because I'm often going for food with people when I'm in Taipei uh there's an
[11550.82 → 11555.22] app called meetup that I think might still be used pretty extensively there
[11555.22 → 11562.42] use um so that's pretty cool so there's a small like a small kind of hole in the
[11562.42 → 11566.18] wall bar I don't drink they have good food
[11566.18 → 11569.60] called pay my tuition which I went to just because I thought the name of it was
[11569.60 → 11577.48] funny nice and ended up being really fantastic food i just randomly bumped into an NVIDIA uh AI
[11577.48 → 11583.28] systems engineer while I was there that didn't know me he just struck up a conversation cool
[11583.28 → 11590.88] uh that was awesome uh down the street from that there's a restaurant called oh man
[11590.88 → 11600.90] one Punjabi ethnic Indian restaurant one one one one um it's rated 5.0 five out of five stars with
[11600.90 → 11609.72] over 6 000 reviews so go for it take those for your recommendation instead of uh something I would say
[11609.72 → 11616.54] um if you're looking for a neat place to stop by there's a place called 2j café which is there's like
[11616.54 → 11624.22] massive skyscraper massive skyscraper tiny very old style house, and it's
[11624.22 → 11630.50] a café they like never sold and turn it into a little café, and it's a neat place in general don't
[11630.50 → 11637.18] miss out on the night don't miss out on the night markets uh there's also a place right by 2j
[11637.18 → 11642.50] café like genuinely right beside it called Dan park d-a-a-n so that is actually just kind of cool
[11642.50 → 11649.82] place to go hang out instead of um a place to eat there's oh this place is awesome okay I'm gonna
[11649.82 → 11659.20] pronounce it wrong but Bashan uh h-u-a-s-h-a-n 1914 creative park it was an old multiple building
[11659.20 → 11665.60] textiles factory thing, and they've turned it into like an arts and creative park where people that
[11665.60 → 11673.00] make things will show up in like vendor style cool sell their own creations and there's like a bunch
[11673.00 → 11677.98] of different like themes as you go through um I've gotten tons of like Christmas presents and stuff
[11677.98 → 11682.60] from there because it's like it'll be like the person who made it standing behind the counter and
[11682.60 → 11687.70] I've had a problem here in bc where I've gone to a version of this and then found a bunch of clearly
[11687.70 → 11693.38] AI inspired things like AI bookmarks and stuff that people are claiming are their own yeah um this place
[11693.38 → 11701.26] I did not have the same problem um that one has 70 000 reviews and is like a big deal thing so go
[11701.26 → 11710.64] check that out um it's very cool maybe one more and honestly I might just leave it there okay perfect
[11710.64 → 11719.12] yeah hi LLD enjoying the show as always aside from wins and losses what's your favourite scrapyard
[11719.12 → 11726.72] memory so far speaking of scrapyard wars oh is it processed it is processed it's processed
[11726.72 → 11727.00] oh
[11727.00 → 11734.88] oh
[11734.88 → 11744.42] look at that video ready it's back and bigger than ever in part two Linus and Luke face off to build
[11744.42 → 11750.32] the ultimate budget home theatre gaming setup using 1400 us dollars they'll scour local listings
[11750.32 → 11756.64] thrift stores and online marketplaces and back alleys to find the best cheap gaming pcs 4k TV
[11756.64 → 11761.74] surround sound systems and used components the goal create a fully functional home entertainment
[11761.74 → 11767.24] centre for gaming movie watching and perfect vibes without breaking the bank you'll see smart DIY
[11767.24 → 11771.98] solutions and intense tech rivalries as each tech fights to be the best bang for the buck setup
[11771.98 → 11775.98] book
[11775.98 → 11776.98] book
[11776.98 → 11777.98] book
[11777.98 → 11781.28] um this is unfair there's only representation in the thumbnail of your team
[11781.28 → 11782.98] yeah well you know
[11782.98 → 11787.26] you're actually I think you're actually most of the episode too ironically
[11787.26 → 11790.52] so that was to make up for that
[11790.52 → 11797.64] all right cool enjoy it you guys it's out early on float plane
[11797.64 → 11806.30] favourite memory from scrapyard wars yeah right oh man for me, it's got to be between finding the
[11806.30 → 11816.24] crack pipe in the milk crate full of motherboards and uh the fix on the motherboard fix was insane that
[11816.24 → 11820.00] was unbelievable oh my god um
[11820.00 → 11823.92] it still works, and it still doesn't make any sense
[11823.92 → 11826.10] I mean
[11826.10 → 11833.90] this isn't really a specific memory as much as it is just like something that happens every single time and is
[11833.90 → 11838.94] a miracle every single time but the way that it always comes down to the wire
[11838.94 → 11844.02] always it always comes down to the wire somehow
[11844.02 → 11851.08] you're scrambling it there are 30 seconds left, and you're going okay this piece and done
[11851.08 → 11859.52] it's crazy because I've heard that that last second thing is spoofed on a lot of reality TV shows
[11859.52 → 11866.00] we like actually don't, and it's it to the point where it's made me question like how real is that
[11866.00 → 11869.44] fact like are some of them actually legit they might be they might be yeah
[11869.44 → 11876.34] like because I feel like we don't think it if it's a real intense competition you're going to use every second you've got
[11876.34 → 11883.38] I would think so, so like for some of these if people are like really pushing it and are actually competitive that they might be real
[11883.38 → 11885.16] timing ending things
[11885.16 → 11891.18] I don't know interesting i oh here's a fun a funny memory I remember the time that I think it was uh
[11891.18 → 11899.00] me and kyle were joking about taking a helicopter because travel costs were not was that you and me
[11899.00 → 11904.70] that wasn't that was down with them yeah it was with them but was it you and me versus them yeah
[11904.70 → 11912.00] oh okay so it was you and me um yeah because travel cost was not included and there was a part that was like
[11912.00 → 11918.16] a couple of hundred miles away or something, and so I was like okay technically we could charter a helicopter
[11918.16 → 11923.60] and we could get there and back in time and that wouldn't count against our budget which was clearly
[11923.60 → 11930.40] not within the spirit of the competition but did follow the letter of the law yes
[11930.40 → 11939.34] hi wan.DL Linus I heard you have litter robots you like which ones are they and what do you recommend
[11939.34 → 11941.90] I don't know how much I like them but I have the whisker 3
[11941.90 → 11950.12] litter robots yeah like kitty litter oh you really gotta dial in which uh litter you're using
[11950.12 → 11957.82] uh because some work way better than others so as long as you do that they are a effort
[11957.82 → 11968.34] reducer um but not all cats love them and stuff make of that what you will I I wouldn't say I love
[11968.34 → 11973.46] them I would say I will continue to use them I don't fully I don't regret the purchase
[11973.46 → 11980.78] greetings from the gathering of the juggles caught you doing halls of illusions in a previous life
[11980.78 → 11988.38] what's your favourite jokers card uh halls of illusions I don't think I've ever made a reference to halls of
[11988.38 → 12003.18] illusions uh halls of illusions lyrics um oh no I've done house of horrors not halls of illusions
[12003.18 → 12012.58] um I am not actually familiar with this particular song, so there's no way that I would have been able
[12012.58 → 12021.92] to quote it um what was the question though what's your favourite joker's card i have to confess I am not
[12021.92 → 12030.56] actually like a full-blown juggle I don't know I don't know the joker's cards I'm so sorry to have
[12030.56 → 12037.62] misled you um i kind of feel right now like I accidentally walked into a gay bar you know
[12037.62 → 12038.70] like a
[12038.70 → 12045.60] not because
[12045.60 → 12048.36] would you still want to have a drink
[12048.36 → 12051.76] I got some extra paint for you Linus
[12051.76 → 12059.32] um you might enjoy it come on yeah like i just I feel like I feel like I've I feel like I've posed a
[12059.32 → 12066.42] little bit like to be clear there are there are probably ICP songs that I could
[12066.42 → 12077.02] probably pretty much like recite from memory but I was not like into it, you know I had a what if
[12077.02 → 12082.26] what if they're actually talking about Balaton I don't even know if that's a real thing yeah they're
[12082.26 → 12089.42] not no they're not uh Balaton is based on ICP that's um next you're going to tell me they made real
[12089.42 → 12098.42] cards what if I bring ago to whale land oh look at this uh, uh I was driving the other day and
[12098.42 → 12106.02] wanted to put some music on uh and decided somebody was talking about like you know how c fox the local
[12106.02 → 12114.40] radio station is like classic music now or whatever um oh no and I decided to throw on blink yeah so I put
[12114.40 → 12123.06] on enema of the state blink 182 and i I think I found where uh the memory hole that happens in my
[12123.06 → 12131.26] brain for names and dates and stuff it's just blink lyrics perfect word for word every single song
[12131.26 → 12137.90] entire album you just pushed everything else out for like I haven't heard any of those songs in like
[12137.90 → 12146.00] a very long time and like i would I was it was literally memorization of the entire album
[12146.00 → 12152.40] because when they weren't singing I could perfectly do the instruments and in between songs I could
[12152.40 → 12158.04] guess the intro to the next song without seeing the like track list or anything because you just
[12158.04 → 12163.68] listened to it cover to cover like so many times I was like whoa I do that with my work playlist
[12163.68 → 12170.76] and then if I hear them in isolation they're just like oh no it's not right yeah Geez that was nuts
[12170.76 → 12176.50] um the way Luke said I was driving the other day it was very letter Kenny yeah that was I'm happy
[12176.50 → 12184.70] someone got it we are Canadian as well yeah a couple more here hi LLD Linus is someone who is busier than
[12184.70 → 12190.94] most how do you balance your work hobbies and family and the difference responsibilities that each entail
[12190.94 → 12205.48] love your content uh no man uh how do I balance something's got to give always, so something gets
[12205.48 → 12212.88] traded off and then someone gets mad at me so I work too much for a while and Yvonne gets mad at me
[12212.88 → 12221.90] and I spend too much time with my family and things fall apart at work and my motorcycle has been
[12221.90 → 12230.60] not painted for two and a half years does that summarize it pretty well I think like one of the
[12230.60 → 12237.84] things that happen is like my hobbies have changed like I used to be really into games that required a
[12237.84 → 12244.88] more rigid schedule like I had to work around other people and their availability and like
[12244.88 → 12250.46] I had to be there when everyone was there otherwise like we wouldn't have enough and stuff whereas like
[12250.46 → 12255.16] now I can't really I can't really do that I like games that I can just drop into play for a little bit and
[12255.16 → 12264.20] then put down when someone needs my attention rich my brother was expressing an enjoyment of one of
[12264.20 → 12268.88] the newer need for speed games and I asked him if he had played Sforza horizon 5, and he hadn't so I got
[12268.88 → 12276.02] it for him, and he told me that he basically can't play it and I was confused because I was like it's a
[12276.02 → 12283.80] it's a great game what do you mean he has two babies yep the missions are a little bit too long yep and
[12283.80 → 12290.88] they don't mid-mission save nope, so games just have games have like an expectation that you will know life
[12290.88 → 12298.70] them many games do, but it's like it's like it's not being able to sit there for hours it's
[12298.70 → 12304.38] being able to sit there for like 10 or more minutes, and it's just not really a thing so he's like I'll
[12304.38 → 12309.24] play later not just the no life thing so the no life thing I mean like they'll have a high degree of
[12309.24 → 12314.18] complexity so that if you have to go away from them for a week you like don't remember like how
[12314.18 → 12318.74] everything works force is definitely not like that but yeah and then the other no life
[12318.74 → 12326.22] thing is that you couldn't possibly have anything else going on right now that the game expects to
[12326.22 → 12333.96] be the focus window of your life, and it's just like all blizzard games being like practically unable
[12333.96 → 12341.98] to be alt tabbed yeah and that's just that's just not a that's just not a thing in my life um like one
[12341.98 → 12347.08] of the things I like about tape to tape is that even though it does allow you to save scum so it's like
[12347.08 → 12353.62] kind of not a good feature um you can pause the campaign, and you can come back to it in a few
[12353.62 → 12358.52] days and deal with it than yeah um it's actually why i kind of ended up getting into vampire survivors
[12358.52 → 12366.86] for a little bit because a run is by definition no more than 30 minutes or 15 yeah hurries is so good
[12366.86 → 12376.24] yep um you get two in on a lunch break it's great like I like i i i I value games where I don't have
[12376.24 → 12381.68] to remember the story I don't have to remember what mission I'm on where I'm going how the controls
[12381.68 → 12387.74] work um and I can be interrupted and go do something else and come back to it two weeks later
[12387.74 → 12393.32] because sometimes it takes that long I think save any time is an accessibility feature fight me
[12393.32 → 12404.54] it would break a lot of things like if you had saved state in something like Elden Ring
[12404.54 → 12410.24] I think that would be not necessarily say save state but like well that's basically what you're
[12410.24 → 12416.32] very, very close to that what's the difference in your mind save state would be like frame
[12416.32 → 12423.86] perfect in a way but I mean you could have a boss fight that's like could take you half an hour
[12423.86 → 12431.98] yeah so should you be able to save multi-checkpoint boss fight, but then you're not really like that's
[12431.98 → 12436.64] part of the challenge is that you have to beat all the phases so it's an accessibility feature
[12436.64 → 12444.46] why is that accessibility yeah attention span if you want to make it easier for yourself
[12444.46 → 12450.16] uh like difficulty level is an accessibility feature in a way you know Elden Ring doesn't
[12450.16 → 12455.18] have a disability filter it you're just good, or you're not are you saying this is a thing that
[12455.18 → 12459.96] is an accessibility feature or are you saying that this should be in every game all the time yeah
[12459.96 → 12464.72] you can turn it off or on if you want a lot of games are moving to pick your own difficulty and i
[12464.72 → 12470.34] think save quantities should be included in that do you do checkpoint do you do sub checkpoint
[12470.34 → 12478.16] what I don't like is when they disguise the accessibility and disability and sorry the
[12478.16 → 12484.76] accessibility and difficulty settings and I can't tell what it is what do you mean it was one of those
[12484.76 → 12493.42] those newer like RPG style games that I played recently expedition 33 uh it was I think it was sea of
[12493.42 → 12499.98] stars accessibility hold on let me have a look uh some of them can get too granular and too
[12499.98 → 12507.10] confusing the new doom is complicated because it's like well how do you want me to play it okay
[12507.10 → 12518.98] okay this was confusing to me because I couldn't tell um like okay they they they kind of say it
[12518.98 → 12529.82] these are weird yeah so they're relics which for Final Fantasy 6 me means
[12529.82 → 12538.06] that you can equip them to like to play the p to be more competitive in battle which is what these are
[12538.06 → 12547.66] but what they actually are is accessibility settings wait you loot these no okay yeah so it just it took me
[12547.66 → 12555.02] a second um because like this doesn't technically make it so that you don't have to like to win fights at all
[12555.02 → 12561.78] like so it just seemed like a convenience thing I was like oh yeah the amulet of storytelling the true
[12561.78 → 12570.86] strike pendant that like i just I got a little confused I couldn't quite tell if they were
[12570.86 → 12575.68] accessibility features I hear you or if any of them were meant to be equipped before and I think it's
[12575.68 → 12579.46] kind of fun I understand how it's confusing kind of cool but I think it's kind of a fun way but like
[12579.46 → 12589.66] I wanted to like to beat the game and I didn't want to there was no sort of physical reason for me to
[12589.66 → 12595.38] need like an accessibility feature necessarily so I wanted to like to beat the game and I couldn't
[12595.38 → 12603.36] really 100 tell what beating the game meant because I couldn't tell what they were like am I supposed to
[12603.36 → 12611.78] use these right okay is playing with none of them on like hard mode because that wasn't necessarily
[12611.78 → 12616.30] what I wanted either I wanted something relatively chill normal yeah what's the what's just like the
[12616.30 → 12622.32] developers intended difficulty that's why something like elder rings great because there's one difficulty
[12622.32 → 12630.62] doing difficulty in general is a worse experience yeah this guy there's like intended way to play
[12630.62 → 12636.24] right, and then you know accessibility features you can make it different oh I see what you mean
[12636.24 → 12642.06] and you said it's great because the list that he just gave didn't have any indication which is the
[12642.06 → 12648.02] like intended experience yeah so Elden Ring has an intended experience and then everything is just
[12648.02 → 12654.12] accessibility features versus having a mishmash of difficulty levels and accessibility features which
[12654.12 → 12658.54] is what the new doom did, and it was very confusing to figure out what the intended way to play which
[12658.54 → 12664.86] apparently is like hard not even normal but like some people would take Elden Ring they'd set it to
[12664.86 → 12669.16] max difficulty if it had difficulty and then people would complain that it's too hard or something like
[12669.16 → 12673.96] that so I don't know it's very, very complicated how you do this stuff but i I didn't want to
[12673.96 → 12679.52] derail it I just think saving any time or saving more often is great for people like your brother with
[12679.52 → 12687.08] children who might not want to redo a boss fight 300 times this needs to get good that is the other thing
[12687.08 → 12690.60] just have a skill issue checkbox, and then it just uninstalls itself
[12690.60 → 12696.94] okay Elden Ring does not refund you all right archived
[12696.94 → 12704.58] hi low density lipoprotein uh what are your thoughts on people on the spectrum with AI girl
[12704.58 → 12712.82] slash boyfriends because they say legitimately because they say they legitimately have trouble with
[12712.82 → 12717.76] real human connections so that's the thing that I was kind of getting at earlier where
[12717.76 → 12727.86] I think that there would be an agreement regardless of you know your leanings um that developing a
[12727.86 → 12735.24] codependency on an AI boyfriend or girlfriend or mother, or you know whatever their whatever the AI is
[12735.24 → 12747.14] role-playing as um developing that dependency is clearly a disordered um state but what people
[12747.14 → 12755.74] don't seem to be able to agree on is what the treatment is of this disordered diluted state um
[12755.74 → 12764.12] yeah and I'm going to be honest with you, i I am not a medical professional and I'm not going to presume to
[12764.12 → 12773.30] say what I think the proper sort of therapy should be in this case, but it is clear that this is
[12773.30 → 12786.12] a disordered state and so um rarely in the case of a disordered state is encouraging further
[12786.12 → 12795.66] disordered state the correct answer that I is as much as I think I could probably say on the subject
[12795.66 → 12802.32] also have some issues where like i I'm I'm presuming the person you're describing in this scenario is
[12802.32 → 12809.56] is far from the person that I'm going to describe in this situation to be very clear um, but we do have
[12809.56 → 12815.80] a problem in current year with a lot of people of self-diagnosing themselves with some actually
[12815.80 → 12823.64] pretty serious things um as in a lot of cases an excuse to not do something or not try or whatever
[12823.64 → 12831.30] else, and it's its really quite sad because it takes away from people that like actually have those um
[12831.30 → 12841.54] uh difficulties or whatever else um, but it's it also sells the person who's doing that
[12841.54 → 12847.90] quite short in what they can accomplish on their own um so if this some is someone who could totally
[12847.90 → 12855.74] figure it out if right, and they sell themselves short on the idea and then just surrender to this
[12855.74 → 12864.90] concept of well I can't because that's really rough um and that is absolutely a thing that people do
[12864.90 → 12873.24] and no again this is not an's situation um I'm sure there are some people that might just
[12873.24 → 12878.06] actually never be able to figure this out and then again along with Linus I don't I don't know what the
[12878.06 → 12884.20] I don't know what to solve is for that I'm far from the right person to answer that but yeah
[12884.20 → 12893.28] and last one I've got for you tonight hello big Linus Luke and Dan the great I've got a question
[12893.28 → 12901.20] for Linus what was the riskiest or dangerous video that was ever made on the channel oh uh
[12901.20 → 12909.24] dangerous video ever made okay there was that uh there was that issue there was that issue we had on
[12909.24 → 12914.06] the uh that warping Asus shoot that unfortunately the footage seems to have been lost for
[12914.06 → 12919.74] which is too bad because it was pretty cool uh where the like canopy thing like blew away
[12919.74 → 12926.60] and then that like jacked guy grabbed it before it like stabbed anybody that wasn't inherently
[12926.60 → 12931.46] dangerous about the shoot, but we didn't sandbag that thing and it that was bad we learned i
[12931.46 → 12937.82] remember that yeah I didn't remember that until now and now I remember that um I hurt myself doing my
[12937.82 → 12946.02] own stunt trying to be a ninja um this was this like super horrible cringe thing that we did for
[12946.02 → 12951.10] uh be quiet back in the day I don't know man I don't know what we're thinking heck yeah dude but uh
[12951.90 → 12957.54] hold on we used to do a lot of jumping off things with fake swords and real swords we used to do a lot
[12957.54 → 12965.36] of that I don't know about a lot of it but I did that so I did not land that um hold on where is it
[12965.36 → 12976.54] where's the flip dang it zoomed there that's the problem hold on okay so
[12976.54 → 12986.88] this flip i am hundred percent did not land yep off of a fence yep um we did have a crash pad because i
[12986.88 → 12994.12] knew I wasn't going to land it yep um pretty big one too my back was pretty sore for a bit so that's
[12994.12 → 12998.00] definitely a dangerous thing that was done the shot of us coming over the roof is sick though
[12998.00 → 13002.80] yeah we probably shouldn't have been on the roof in the dark like that it was sick though
[13002.80 → 13014.40] um oh I got injured doing this uh fighting Dennis he landed on my knee oh yeah um man I wonder how
[13014.40 → 13019.84] many things I've been injured doing over the years channel super fund seems like a solid candidate for
[13019.84 → 13026.74] injuries oh yeah I mean nerd sports was kind of insane oh yeah the lacrosse one was like actually
[13026.74 → 13036.40] dumb um we're like super lucky that they decided not to kill us yeah yeah they could have
[13036.40 → 13045.60] um here's the most replayed moment the keyboard warriors so uh I remember I was roughhousing one of
[13045.60 → 13050.60] them a little bit, and then he like mentioned to me that he could flatten the rest of the team and i
[13050.60 → 13054.32] was like that's fair I'll leave it alone
[13054.32 → 13067.48] uh you know nerd sports is coming back right no yeah there's a badminton episode oh I know that yeah
[13067.48 → 13078.36] yeah I was uh i I poked my head in on um oh shoot who was if it was Jake bell and someone
[13079.00 → 13085.00] oh shoot I forget, but they were doing commentary for it, they weren't live commentating the match
[13085.00 → 13090.76] like we had for the original nerd sports they were just watching the edit and like reacting to it
[13090.76 → 13096.68] essentially but I don't know whatever what's the difference um it's hilarious it's its going to be great
[13096.68 → 13101.48] David said the video was already good enough without them coming in and doing commentary
[13102.12 → 13107.16] and so it's just that I'm sure the commentary is great I'm really excited about the commentary um
[13107.96 → 13110.84] speaking of poking your head on things have you even seen your new desk
[13112.44 → 13118.52] I have a new desk in labs no yeah okay I didn't know I didn't know had one you asked for a desk in
[13118.52 → 13123.80] labs oh cool well I guess I'll use it then all the labs people like did your setup all nice and
[13123.80 → 13131.00] stuff oh that sounds sick that makes a lot more sense you just didn't know okay yeah yeah you and
[13131.00 → 13137.16] me have like facing out desks kind of in the corner so we have screen protected oh whatever blah blah
[13137.16 → 13141.16] blah that sounds great all your stuff from your office is all like laid out oh that's super cool
[13141.16 → 13149.16] yeah exciting have you seen the new lab at all no oh wow dude I well I've been out for two weeks
[13149.16 → 13155.40] or a week that basically means you haven't been in that building at all since you've been back dude
[13155.40 → 13160.92] i I don't even have an office here yet like I'm just using that meeting room like I don't actually
[13160.92 → 13167.64] have my own desk here so i kind of i moved over here when I started the vibe coding challenge
[13167.64 → 13172.36] and that was the room that they just set up for me to shoot in right it happens to be my old office but
[13172.36 → 13177.32] it's its I don't have literally anything of my own in there I just bring in my laptop which is now broken
[13177.32 → 13181.80] and there's a dock I wonder why because it's a meeting room yeah so I don't actually have an
[13181.80 → 13187.32] office right now for the first time well you do since the house well not an enclosed one yeah yeah
[13188.12 → 13191.56] so the last time I didn't have an office was in the Langley house when I worked in the editing
[13191.56 → 13196.76] den I don't like them I had one for a short period of time and then have opted to not ever since
[13199.48 → 13204.76] and I've opted to not continue the wan show we'll see you again next week guys same bad time
[13204.76 → 13216.76] same bad channel bye
[13234.76 → 13235.26] you
