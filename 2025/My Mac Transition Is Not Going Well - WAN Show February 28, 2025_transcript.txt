[0.00 --> 2.48]  What is up everyone?
[3.12 --> 4.52]  Welcome to the WAN show.
[4.64 --> 5.82]  Such a mellow introduction.
[5.96 --> 8.22]  Well, we've got a great show lined up for you guys today
[8.22 --> 10.76]  and I don't want to, you know, scare anybody off.
[10.96 --> 11.96]  Welcome to the WAN show.
[12.88 --> 15.08]  You can be my hero AMD.
[16.52 --> 21.02]  Man, the RX 9070 and 9070 XT announcement.
[21.60 --> 25.84]  I have to admit, I completely forgot to make fun of the silly naming scheme
[25.84 --> 29.28]  because these cards look genuinely exciting.
[29.28 --> 30.74]  I can't wait to talk about that.
[30.88 --> 35.08]  I'm also going to be talking about my recent transition to macOS.
[35.64 --> 38.44]  Luke, I am not having a good time.
[38.60 --> 41.92]  I had a meeting in the office next to his while he was,
[42.36 --> 44.36]  as far as I can tell, just using his computer.
[44.60 --> 45.44]  No, I was trying to.
[45.52 --> 48.86]  And it was incredibly distracting because he was screaming like half the time.
[48.90 --> 49.74]  Wait, that was with you.
[50.62 --> 51.02]  Yeah.
[51.28 --> 52.16]  That was with Dan.
[52.48 --> 53.50]  So Dan remembers that.
[53.52 --> 54.84]  That was a lot of yelling.
[55.36 --> 56.60]  What do you mean he remembers it?
[56.62 --> 57.62]  It was like two days ago.
[57.62 --> 58.46]  Yeah, no, yeah, yeah.
[58.48 --> 61.22]  I only got about 96 hours and then it just fades.
[61.52 --> 63.88]  What else we got lined up today?
[64.08 --> 69.22]  Oh, we didn't have a huge thing before the intro,
[69.36 --> 70.78]  so I didn't prep anything at all.
[70.78 --> 76.26]  More companies are apparently releasing the source code for video games.
[76.38 --> 77.72]  Oh, this is so cool.
[78.06 --> 78.24]  Yeah.
[78.38 --> 81.38]  So EA released source code for four Command & Conquer games.
[81.38 --> 82.04]  That is so cool.
[82.24 --> 86.64]  That was not on my estimates for what would happen this year.
[86.72 --> 87.82]  It's called a bingo card, but yes.
[87.88 --> 88.78]  Sure, there we go.
[90.06 --> 91.76]  What else should we talk about?
[92.02 --> 92.68]  Bloody hell, Luke.
[92.68 --> 97.14]  I'm looking...
[97.14 --> 98.18]  I'm going to just roll it.
[98.26 --> 98.92]  I'm going to just roll it.
[98.92 --> 99.80]  You're going to lose your shot.
[100.00 --> 101.12]  Whatever this is,
[101.24 --> 103.36]  psionic launches new advanced ability,
[103.54 --> 105.06]  the hand for humans and robots?
[105.38 --> 106.14]  Question mark?
[106.36 --> 107.28]  Whatever that is.
[107.28 --> 109.28]  Whatever that is.
[109.28 --> 128.80]  The show is brought to you today by ThreatLocker.
[128.86 --> 129.24]  That's right.
[129.28 --> 131.52]  There is one sponsor for the WAN show.
[132.72 --> 134.54]  ThreatLocker.com slash WAN show.
[134.72 --> 135.56]  You can check them out.
[135.92 --> 136.32]  ThreatLocker.
[136.50 --> 137.10]  They are...
[137.10 --> 138.74]  It's like a WAN show takeover.
[139.28 --> 141.06]  I mean, we also still have our chair sponsor,
[141.20 --> 143.92]  Secret Lab and our rap partner, Dbrand.
[144.04 --> 147.62]  But ThreatLocker is the one sponsor of this WAN show today.
[147.82 --> 150.66]  And we have like a special like read for them.
[150.76 --> 152.40]  And I think Luke is doing it or something.
[153.10 --> 153.54]  Cool.
[153.82 --> 154.16]  Nice.
[154.44 --> 156.04]  Let's get right into our first topic.
[156.24 --> 156.52]  Okay.
[156.86 --> 158.44]  Do we do Linus switches to Mac OS?
[158.54 --> 163.40]  Or should we talk about the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT?
[163.56 --> 165.14]  Let's save the rage for later.
[165.24 --> 166.48]  Let's talk about AMD.
[166.48 --> 168.26]  This morning...
[168.26 --> 169.30]  Yes, this morning.
[169.40 --> 173.04]  AMD announced that the 9070 and 9070 XT...
[173.04 --> 177.24]  And yes, I've said those model numbers a lot of times because I'm trying to burn them into your mind.
[177.68 --> 181.54]  These are the option that you might actually be able to buy.
[181.64 --> 185.26]  They're going to be launching March 6th with what AMD called...
[185.26 --> 186.94]  Dang it.
[187.18 --> 189.18]  I can't find the exact wording.
[189.28 --> 193.34]  But it was something along the lines of wide availability.
[194.66 --> 198.16]  Which I think means that they walk endlessly down hallways.
[198.26 --> 200.76]  And they get wider and wider as they go.
[200.76 --> 208.44]  They are going to be coming in at pricing that AMD claims will be $549 and $599 respectively.
[208.68 --> 217.50]  And are going to use their brand new RDNA 4 architecture that they are claiming is about 40% faster per CU than RDNA 3.
[217.50 --> 227.60]  They are alleging near native quality in performance mode with their new FSR 4 upscaling.
[228.28 --> 236.64]  And both of these cards will have 16 gigs of RAM at their $549 and $599 pricing respectively.
[237.28 --> 239.90]  This is pretty exciting.
[239.90 --> 241.82]  Well, at least one of them is pretty exciting.
[242.12 --> 242.38]  Yeah.
[242.80 --> 251.56]  The 9070 looks like AMD is doing that thing again where they launch a new, you know, series of cards.
[251.76 --> 254.06]  And they have the one that makes sense.
[254.44 --> 258.30]  And then they have the one that you'd have to be a big dumb idiot to buy.
[258.46 --> 261.94]  I hope they have like 50 XTs for every non-XT because...
[261.94 --> 263.44]  And then it doesn't sell at all.
[263.68 --> 263.88]  Yeah.
[263.98 --> 265.32]  And then AMD is like...
[265.32 --> 265.68]  What?
[266.02 --> 266.60]  Ha ha!
[267.22 --> 269.82]  That was our plan all along.
[270.56 --> 274.26]  Um, 9070s, now 20% off discount.
[274.46 --> 274.64]  Woo!
[275.34 --> 275.74]  AMD.
[275.96 --> 276.16]  Yeah.
[276.58 --> 281.32]  If anyone from there is watching, maybe just don't do that.
[281.42 --> 282.20]  That'd be pretty sick.
[282.34 --> 283.66]  I do understand the appeal.
[283.76 --> 285.22]  Like, I understand why they're doing it.
[285.52 --> 292.48]  Because it's possible that with the market being the way that it is and availability of GPUs being what they are,
[292.48 --> 295.80]  that 9070s will just sell out regardless and they can make some money on this one,
[295.88 --> 299.28]  while the XT is sort of their more aggressive play.
[299.90 --> 301.06]  So I get that.
[301.16 --> 302.38]  I follow that logic.
[302.94 --> 306.74]  I also follow the logic that your XT...
[307.78 --> 315.16]  Um, there's a lot more risk to like discounting it in the longer term in terms of the perception of your brand.
[315.16 --> 323.26]  If a bunch of people buy this thing for $599 and then, you know, it turns out that you ultimately have to adjust the pricing of it down the road,
[323.38 --> 327.12]  it's kind of like an FU to your, you know, flagship tier customers.
[327.32 --> 330.64]  Whereas the 9070 can be kind of like your s*** kicker skew.
[330.64 --> 338.66]  You just like discount it without eroding the perceived value of what XT means in your lineup.
[338.98 --> 339.10]  Yeah.
[339.86 --> 346.14]  You get to show a big discount because it's $549 MSRP and you can get it for $499.
[346.62 --> 349.86]  You know, the MSI trio card, whatever, right?
[349.86 --> 352.22]  I understand why they do it.
[352.52 --> 359.20]  But guys, we saw this with the 7900 XT and the 7900 XTX.
[359.48 --> 367.52]  The XTX got really positive reviews because at $1,000 at that time, that made a lot of sense.
[367.60 --> 368.10]  It's pretty killer.
[368.10 --> 372.78]  And then the XT for $100 less was way less performant.
[373.06 --> 382.86]  And that's a weird thing that the flagship gives you the better bang for the buck than the like step down, supposed to be more value oriented card.
[383.02 --> 386.12]  And I do understand that these probably use the same die.
[386.28 --> 392.04]  Like my understanding is that with RDNA 4, AMD dramatically cut down on how many dies they were building.
[392.16 --> 394.66]  They didn't even do a super high end competitor.
[395.06 --> 397.98]  I don't know what they have coming in the lower end, but they basically were like,
[397.98 --> 404.32]  okay, we need to focus this generation on the cards that we think are going to address the majority of gamers.
[404.56 --> 406.78]  Okay, so these are probably based on the same die.
[406.86 --> 409.12]  They're both using a 256-bit bus.
[409.64 --> 411.96]  They both have a similar number of CUs.
[412.04 --> 415.26]  Like there's no way they have two dies, one that's 64 and one that's 56.
[415.48 --> 418.80]  This is going to be 9070 is a cut down 9070 XT.
[418.98 --> 425.54]  So I understand too that from a pricing standpoint, they essentially paid the same for this silicon, right?
[425.54 --> 428.10]  I don't care.
[429.38 --> 434.18]  You need to have product stratification that makes sense.
[434.34 --> 442.14]  And looking at these specs, the 9070 is going to be a much lesser card compared to the 9070 XT.
[442.26 --> 444.74]  It is clocked like what?
[445.32 --> 447.36]  85% as high?
[447.52 --> 448.72]  That's off the top of my head.
[448.72 --> 450.00]  So don't quote me on that.
[450.08 --> 455.44]  But it drops like over 10% of the AI accelerators.
[455.64 --> 462.74]  It drops over 10% of your ray tracing accelerators and drops over 10% of your compute units.
[463.14 --> 467.00]  And it's giving you a price that is, hold on a second, calculator.
[467.36 --> 471.92]  Okay, so 549 divided by 599.
[471.92 --> 478.40]  And then it only drops like 8.5% of the price.
[478.70 --> 481.68]  This is going to be a markedly slower card.
[482.84 --> 485.18]  So AMD, please, please no.
[486.18 --> 487.70]  New Media Engine looks good.
[487.84 --> 489.10]  Very excited about that.
[489.18 --> 493.96]  It could possibly be like doable to stream to Twitch on this thing.
[494.46 --> 499.70]  AMD is offering unlimited encodes, streams, and sessions, which, okay.
[499.70 --> 501.22]  Okay, hold on.
[501.28 --> 501.84]  We'll get to that.
[502.78 --> 506.10]  So I was talking to someone from the writing team.
[506.14 --> 508.22]  And they were basically saying, well, does this really matter?
[508.74 --> 513.24]  Because realistically, you're going to run into a limit, like a performance limitation
[513.24 --> 515.72]  before you're going to run into a session limitation.
[516.32 --> 518.74]  And what I said was, okay, you would think that.
[519.18 --> 524.90]  But if you're only encoding like relatively low bit rate 1080p or even like 720p,
[524.90 --> 530.58]  like if you're using this thing for like, I don't know, like I ran into this issue when
[530.58 --> 536.16]  I was setting up the cameras at that badminton club during COVID when I wanted to watch my
[536.16 --> 536.76]  son's tournaments.
[537.02 --> 542.64]  So I set up cameras on all the courts and I set up like an OBS box that would stream them
[542.64 --> 543.52]  all simultaneously.
[544.16 --> 548.92]  And Nvidia cards, even though I had, because I was encoding at relatively low resolution and
[548.92 --> 553.10]  bit rate, I had plenty, plenty of headroom.
[553.10 --> 554.76]  A lot of performance in terms of performance.
[555.12 --> 561.10]  But because of the encoding session limit, I wasn't able to encode that many streams at
[561.10 --> 561.38]  once.
[561.48 --> 566.04]  So it is pretty cool to me that AMD basically goes, okay, yeah, like realistically, if you're
[566.04 --> 570.44]  encoding at 8K, 80 FPS or whatever, you'll get one.
[570.74 --> 572.16]  Effectively, your limit is one.
[572.24 --> 572.44]  Yeah.
[572.60 --> 576.94]  But if you're encoding at a lot less, hey, you can just kind of like decide.
[577.14 --> 577.76]  I prefer this.
[577.82 --> 578.46]  I'm just surprised.
[578.88 --> 579.94]  I'm very surprised.
[580.10 --> 580.24]  Yeah.
[580.24 --> 583.90]  I mean, AMD doesn't have a functioning professional card.
[584.20 --> 584.46]  Yeah.
[584.60 --> 585.36]  Line up anymore.
[585.52 --> 587.26]  They're not going to chew out their own market share.
[587.38 --> 588.10]  So what's the point?
[588.22 --> 588.38]  Yeah.
[588.50 --> 590.26]  So I guess, I guess that's part of it.
[590.38 --> 594.88]  But like, yeah, I'm into it, especially if the quality is decent.
[594.88 --> 596.98]  Like I had to do this whole stupid workaround.
[597.08 --> 600.60]  I had to find like a hacked driver that unlocked it on Windows.
[600.88 --> 604.94]  I think it's easier on Linux, but I was running Windows because I was deal with it.
[604.94 --> 609.40]  And it was just, it was just such a hassle.
[610.32 --> 612.92]  And so just not having to do that would be great.
[613.64 --> 618.20]  AMD is also claiming that their driver support for these new cards will be the best they've
[618.20 --> 618.86]  ever had.
[619.30 --> 620.46]  Have they claimed this before?
[620.76 --> 621.10]  Oh, yeah.
[621.10 --> 625.40]  I mean, I don't know if they've claimed it at launch before, but do you remember the
[625.40 --> 626.38]  Crimson drivers?
[626.90 --> 628.56]  He remembers the Crimson drivers.
[628.56 --> 629.60]  This is why I asked the question.
[629.96 --> 634.82]  AMD, I believe it was Crimson because they had a couple like, like driver rebrands over
[634.82 --> 637.18]  the years back when they didn't have any new hardware.
[637.18 --> 644.56]  And I think it was Crimson that they like tried to get us to make a dedicated LTT video about.
[644.84 --> 651.42]  And I was like, brother, we don't, we don't cover a driver update, but tell you what.
[651.60 --> 653.62]  And then I was like, Luke, do you want to like look?
[653.88 --> 657.86]  I think it crashed like multiple times in the one day you were looking at it or something
[657.86 --> 658.18]  like that.
[658.24 --> 661.78]  I don't remember the exact details, but I remember it was, it was rough.
[662.06 --> 662.30]  Yeah.
[662.30 --> 668.90]  It was a hot steaming pile of garbage, but they say they've tested more hardware configurations
[668.90 --> 669.48]  in the lab.
[669.58 --> 673.42]  They've got AI integrated into their testing and a bug report tool directly in the driver.
[673.72 --> 677.12]  Their dedicated AI hardware looks pretty impressive based on what they've shown.
[677.32 --> 685.38]  However, however, the rumors of a 32 gig version of the card have been squished squashed.
[685.98 --> 690.60]  That doesn't mean that they will never do it, but it does mean that we're not going
[690.60 --> 693.06]  to be expecting it anytime immediately.
[694.30 --> 695.92]  What else we got here?
[696.26 --> 698.82]  Reception has been massively positive to this card.
[699.04 --> 705.68]  I mean, it's hard to be upset when AMD is promising roughly 5070 Ti performance for $150 less.
[706.26 --> 708.80]  And they are claiming wide availability.
[708.96 --> 709.32]  There it is.
[709.38 --> 709.52]  Okay.
[709.58 --> 710.34]  So that's in our notes.
[710.34 --> 726.96]  That was the most pathetic slap that I have ever seen in my life.
[726.96 --> 727.32]  You don't want me to go.
[727.50 --> 729.02]  Well, you got to make a sound at least.
[729.12 --> 730.74]  Well, with the headphones on, I can't really do it.
[730.82 --> 732.72]  That was so sad.
[732.78 --> 733.68]  I'll go if you want.
[733.94 --> 735.06]  You have to make a sound.
[735.06 --> 738.18]  Oh, ow.
[738.98 --> 740.36]  That was not going.
[740.60 --> 741.62]  That's my punishment.
[742.64 --> 749.64]  That's my punishment for believing AMD about stock availability.
[751.08 --> 753.12]  I didn't actually expect that to hurt.
[754.26 --> 755.24]  That was really.
[755.70 --> 756.02]  All right.
[756.12 --> 757.10]  That sounded like a real one.
[757.16 --> 757.42]  Good job.
[757.66 --> 758.62]  That's my punishment.
[759.48 --> 761.78]  And, but I do.
[762.64 --> 763.28]  Do you know why?
[763.84 --> 764.34]  Why?
[765.06 --> 769.96]  Because we saw ads for this card weeks ago.
[770.48 --> 770.54]  Yeah.
[770.76 --> 773.50]  AMD intended to launch this weeks ago.
[773.66 --> 777.70]  What it seems like is they put it back in the oven driver wise.
[777.94 --> 778.22]  Right.
[778.48 --> 785.38]  But the way that the way that production out time allocation works just because they delayed
[785.38 --> 787.78]  the launch because they were working on the software.
[788.26 --> 791.94]  That doesn't mean that they stop freaking making wafers.
[792.16 --> 792.34]  Yeah.
[792.34 --> 795.26]  That doesn't mean they stop producing cards.
[795.66 --> 799.80]  So we know that they were planning to launch this weeks ago.
[800.22 --> 807.08]  We know that retail cards have been popping up already in the lead up to this launch like
[807.08 --> 808.42]  a while ago.
[808.62 --> 809.62]  Like a while ago.
[809.62 --> 812.08]  So I believe.
[813.66 --> 815.94]  And I deserved that for believing it.
[815.94 --> 820.42]  But I believe that AMD actually has some cards out there for a change.
[820.82 --> 822.06]  And I am.
[822.06 --> 824.46]  I am cautiously excited.
[824.84 --> 828.30]  I don't believe that because I should.
[828.44 --> 831.70]  I believe that because I really, really, really, really, really, really want to.
[831.92 --> 832.28]  Yeah.
[832.56 --> 835.06]  I wonder what their expectations for sales are though.
[835.32 --> 835.60]  Like.
[835.94 --> 836.78]  I don't know.
[837.00 --> 837.92]  Because like what if this.
[838.04 --> 839.74]  I don't necessarily know that it will.
[839.74 --> 844.72]  Because there's a lot of brand loyalty in this space.
[844.92 --> 845.40]  Oh, a lot.
[845.56 --> 846.84]  But say it goes gangbusters.
[847.00 --> 848.06]  Like do they really have enough?
[848.18 --> 849.40]  Even if they've been shipping for a while.
[849.54 --> 849.76]  I don't.
[849.86 --> 850.24]  I don't know.
[850.74 --> 855.42]  Because they have to make up not only for, you know, AMD customers who have been itching
[855.42 --> 861.24]  for an upgrade to, you know, their 7700 XT or like, you know, 6700 class card, right?
[861.64 --> 863.48]  Or like a 5700 XT.
[863.70 --> 866.72]  Like desperately waiting for AMD to really have like a killer card.
[866.84 --> 867.88]  That's a great value, right?
[868.00 --> 868.12]  Yeah.
[868.24 --> 870.72]  They not only have to deal with that pent up demand.
[870.84 --> 874.96]  But they have to deal with the pent up demand of Nvidia gamers who are like, yo, where the
[874.96 --> 877.06]  f*** is anything for me to buy?
[878.42 --> 882.10]  And that's like 85% of the market.
[882.44 --> 883.54]  Yeah, that's a lot of people.
[883.54 --> 891.92]  So unless AMD went like all in and produced 10X of what they would have normally forecast
[891.92 --> 892.26]  to.
[893.16 --> 894.98]  That's why I'm saying like, I don't know.
[895.04 --> 898.06]  They might have shipped like more than you would expect for a launch.
[898.38 --> 901.84]  And it still might not be enough and still might lead into scalping.
[902.54 --> 905.20]  Because like there's nothing from the other side.
[905.98 --> 907.06]  So I don't know.
[907.14 --> 907.32]  Yeah.
[907.38 --> 909.34]  And it's not just scalpers, right?
[909.42 --> 910.84]  Like don't kid yourself.
[911.00 --> 912.10]  Mining is still a thing.
[912.10 --> 912.58]  Yeah.
[913.26 --> 916.12]  Like I've seen so many people be like, yeah, it's all the AI.
[916.92 --> 917.28]  Okay.
[919.24 --> 920.24]  Don't kid yourself.
[920.44 --> 922.24]  Mining is a lot less popular these days.
[922.42 --> 922.62]  Yeah.
[922.62 --> 923.96]  But it's still absolutely happening.
[924.32 --> 924.72]  Absolutely.
[925.14 --> 925.54]  Yeah.
[925.54 --> 931.16]  And the contacts that are, you know, getting miners access to these cards before the general
[931.16 --> 933.68]  public are still able to intercept them.
[933.76 --> 936.50]  If anything, I would think there's less scrutiny on them than before.
[936.74 --> 937.14]  Yeah.
[937.14 --> 943.72]  So unless AMD like really is going to flood the market with these things, I would still expect
[943.72 --> 945.18]  pricing to be a little bit elevated.
[945.18 --> 950.40]  But I'm just hoping that it won't be extremely elevated.
[950.96 --> 952.42]  And with that said, I mean, hope.
[952.52 --> 954.52]  What does hope even do for you?
[954.58 --> 962.62]  I mean, I've been bugging Intel on like an every few days or so basis going like, you know,
[962.76 --> 965.12]  hey, what's the deal with channel pricing?
[965.32 --> 966.60]  Hopefully this can be fixed.
[967.14 --> 968.58]  Hey, inventory update.
[968.64 --> 969.68]  Are you ramping production?
[969.68 --> 971.46]  Do you have any idea what's going on with supply?
[971.60 --> 981.74]  Because B580 and B570 to a lesser degree, but B580 was looking like a savior for entry
[981.74 --> 983.68]  level, you know, affordable gaming.
[983.80 --> 984.34]  And you know what?
[984.64 --> 987.32]  It's still somewhat reasonable.
[987.70 --> 989.34]  You know, what is MSRP supposed to be?
[989.90 --> 991.20]  250 US dollars.
[992.28 --> 994.22]  Yeah, it's not 250 US dollars.
[994.34 --> 998.42]  They're all closer to like just under 300 from the last time that I...
[998.42 --> 999.44]  Oh, this is Canadian.
[999.44 --> 1000.22]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1000.26 --> 1000.78]  There's your problem.
[1001.96 --> 1007.54]  And there are still occasional cards that you can find for close to MSRP.
[1007.70 --> 1014.86]  I saw some at I think Canada Computers for about 370 CAD or 380 CAD, which is about 250
[1014.86 --> 1015.52]  US dollars.
[1016.02 --> 1025.22]  I also saw some B580s on Newegg that come as part of a bundle, but are darn close to MSRP
[1025.22 --> 1026.06]  when you account for...
[1026.06 --> 1027.08]  Oh, it's out of stock now.
[1027.18 --> 1027.80]  Bloody hell.
[1027.80 --> 1031.10]  Well, this deal was in stock recently.
[1031.26 --> 1038.20]  So it was a B580 with a 650 watt power supply for 334 US dollars.
[1038.40 --> 1041.14]  That is actually not that far off.
[1041.26 --> 1042.82]  But no, the rest of them are all...
[1042.82 --> 1044.98]  Man, some of them are even over 400 now.
[1045.10 --> 1045.34]  Here's one.
[1045.40 --> 1046.90]  Channel pricing has been such a mess.
[1047.80 --> 1048.72]  Like across the board.
[1048.72 --> 1051.72]  Oh, this one's 359, which is...
[1051.72 --> 1055.26]  Again, it's too high when the MSRP is 250.
[1055.26 --> 1056.10]  Wasn't that 379?
[1056.14 --> 1056.86]  There's promo code.
[1057.00 --> 1057.20]  Oh.
[1057.58 --> 1058.78]  Yeah, for 20 bucks off.
[1058.78 --> 1059.78]  I need AMD now.
[1059.78 --> 1060.14]  Um...
[1060.14 --> 1064.00]  I need AMD now.
[1064.30 --> 1065.70]  You know, I was rooting for Intel.
[1065.80 --> 1067.96]  Intel's still figuring out their inventory apparently.
[1068.24 --> 1075.96]  So now I'm rooting for AMD to just flood the channel and make it unsustainable for the other
[1075.96 --> 1078.50]  players to be priced way out of whack.
[1078.50 --> 1084.54]  This is an opportunity for AMD to grab some serious market share, which will get developers
[1084.54 --> 1090.30]  to seriously focus on optimizing for AMD, which could lead to gamers taking AMD more seriously
[1090.30 --> 1096.30]  as an option, turning AMD finally into a player for the first time since like, what?
[1096.44 --> 1099.04]  The early 2000s, if we're being honest.
[1100.90 --> 1107.32]  Into like an actual other option, not a like consolation option.
[1107.32 --> 1108.52]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[1108.64 --> 1110.18]  I mean, honestly, I haven't minded.
[1110.72 --> 1113.02]  I haven't minded rolling my 7900 XTX.
[1113.14 --> 1116.76]  I don't, I don't always game on that machine, right?
[1116.80 --> 1119.44]  Like I also have my 380 like land rig.
[1119.54 --> 1124.34]  That's one of the like water cooled ones, but I haven't had any problems with it.
[1124.36 --> 1127.10]  Like the Radeon challenge wasn't really a challenge.
[1128.62 --> 1130.18]  Oh, come on, let's go.
[1131.10 --> 1133.42]  Um, what else we got to say here about the launch?
[1133.60 --> 1133.92]  I believe.
[1133.92 --> 1139.22]  The community continues to be very vocal about disliking frame generation technology.
[1139.44 --> 1143.74]  Lots of fake frames comments in the chat when AMD was live streaming their announcement.
[1144.30 --> 1145.38]  You also can't go without it though.
[1145.50 --> 1146.74]  They can't launch the card without it.
[1146.82 --> 1149.28]  Like it's, you gotta have it.
[1149.36 --> 1153.46]  With that said, you know, frame gen is part of the FSR 4 package.
[1153.46 --> 1160.78]  So, um, yeah, be ready for AMD to do some, some, some, some generation of frames.
[1160.94 --> 1169.34]  I guess all that we can really hope for is that they'll do a pretty good job and that you won't need it if you don't like it.
[1169.34 --> 1178.74]  Cause I think that's something that a lot of the enthusiasts are struggling with a little bit.
[1178.80 --> 1186.02]  I think that it is really easy for us to take our own values and our own priorities and just kind of assume that everyone else's are the same.
[1186.02 --> 1192.94]  But when I think about the gamers in my life, not all of them are enthusiasts.
[1193.34 --> 1194.96]  Not all of them are pixel peepers.
[1195.18 --> 1196.08]  Most of them aren't.
[1196.88 --> 1205.70]  Most of the people that I know, if I were to put an extra 40 milliseconds of input latency on something, they probably wouldn't notice.
[1205.70 --> 1206.22]  Yep.
[1206.56 --> 1216.78]  If I were to have some weird image quality crap going on, unless it flickers or, or draws the eye in some like lizard brain to look for it.
[1216.86 --> 1225.30]  Or unless I say, even if I set them looking for it, dude, sometimes you'll turn on HDR and people be like, sorry, did you change it yet?
[1225.90 --> 1229.56]  Like I, and I'm talking like content that like really pops, you know?
[1229.60 --> 1231.26]  And, and, and that's the thing, right?
[1231.26 --> 1235.92]  So, you know, to our audience, we're kind of going, okay, how does this perform, you know, without frame gen?
[1236.44 --> 1244.50]  But for a lot of people turning on frame gen and like feeling that additional smoothness and just seeing a higher number is going to be, is going to be fine, dude.
[1244.50 --> 1259.70]  Like I'll, I'll always remember that like slack jawed guy in the beanbag chair that I talked to at PAX one year who was gaming on an Nvidia shield, like the little, the little clamshell Android handheld, not the, like the TV console, the little clamshell thing.
[1259.70 --> 1267.20]  And he was streaming over wifi from a gaming PC that was somewhere else on the show floor playing like a triple A game on this thing.
[1267.20 --> 1267.98]  And I'm like, Oh yeah.
[1267.98 --> 1269.50]  Like how's the latency?
[1269.62 --> 1273.50]  And he's like, Oh yeah, that's cool, man.
[1273.94 --> 1279.04]  Like absolutely zero appreciation whatsoever for like what he was seeing like that.
[1279.22 --> 1286.28]  And, and that, you know, whatever, like, I'm sure he's really passionate about like cars or something, but obviously, you know,
[1286.28 --> 1290.08]  the image quality of like the gaming experience is, is not that meaningful.
[1290.72 --> 1294.72]  And so frame gen is here to stay.
[1295.66 --> 1296.86]  You don't have to use it.
[1297.10 --> 1298.24]  You don't have to like it.
[1298.40 --> 1303.52]  You don't have to endorse it, you know, but it's, it's not, it's not going anywhere.
[1303.70 --> 1304.62]  Nvidia is invested.
[1305.28 --> 1306.62]  AMD is now invested.
[1306.86 --> 1309.00]  It's a matter of time before Intel has something.
[1309.56 --> 1312.04]  Do they, wait, do they have frame gen as part of XCSS too?
[1312.10 --> 1312.80]  I don't think so.
[1314.56 --> 1315.78]  XCSS frame gen.
[1317.04 --> 1317.60]  Oh yeah.
[1317.62 --> 1318.80]  No, they have frame generation already.
[1318.88 --> 1319.18]  There you go.
[1319.62 --> 1319.72]  Yeah.
[1319.74 --> 1320.52]  I forgot about that.
[1320.84 --> 1322.42]  So XCSS too has frame gen.
[1322.42 --> 1326.02]  So all three major graphics players are invested in frame gen.
[1326.06 --> 1329.30]  It's not going anywhere, but you don't have to turn it on.
[1329.60 --> 1332.62]  I suspect that the least invested in frame gen is probably Intel.
[1333.60 --> 1334.28]  I don't know.
[1334.34 --> 1335.58]  XCSS is pretty good.
[1336.02 --> 1339.78]  We were playing around with it the other day and it's like our, that video is coming.
[1339.82 --> 1341.84]  Actually, we're doing a, we're doing a battle mage challenge.
[1342.30 --> 1342.42]  Yeah.
[1342.56 --> 1344.52]  So both, this is hilarious.
[1344.52 --> 1349.86]  Both David and Plouffe are switching to battle mage.
[1350.06 --> 1353.18]  I was going to do it, but you wanted the, the shot.
[1353.40 --> 1354.44]  I didn't want anything.
[1354.92 --> 1356.24]  Oh, they told me you wanted it.
[1356.30 --> 1356.88]  What did I want?
[1357.38 --> 1360.10]  Us to have our computers in here locally for the GPU swap.
[1360.64 --> 1362.32]  And I was like, I don't have time to tear everything down.
[1362.66 --> 1363.18]  That was the Plouffe initiative.
[1363.44 --> 1363.68]  Oh.
[1363.68 --> 1364.32]  Yeah.
[1364.40 --> 1367.28]  I agree with him that like, like the way.
[1367.28 --> 1369.32]  It is probably better than just like cell phone shooting at home.
[1369.32 --> 1369.42]  Yeah.
[1369.50 --> 1371.36]  Like the, the, like it was supposed to be like.
[1371.36 --> 1372.32]  The framing of the video is probably better.
[1372.32 --> 1374.26]  Everybody brings in their computers and upgrades together.
[1374.26 --> 1375.94]  But like, I, yeah, no, no, it's fine.
[1375.98 --> 1377.74]  I was like, okay, then Luke doesn't have to do it.
[1377.90 --> 1378.04]  Sure.
[1378.08 --> 1379.52]  But yeah, Plouffe and David are doing it.
[1379.52 --> 1386.06]  So Plouffe, well, first of all, David is pulling a 7900 XT out of one of his computers
[1386.06 --> 1388.74]  and a 3090 out of the other one.
[1388.80 --> 1389.58]  Oh, he's doing two.
[1389.76 --> 1392.74]  He's doing two because, and he was like, yeah.
[1392.74 --> 1393.48]  So he can't dodge it now.
[1393.48 --> 1395.00]  He felt it wouldn't be fair.
[1395.18 --> 1395.38]  Yeah.
[1395.52 --> 1396.54]  To upgrade only one.
[1396.86 --> 1396.92]  That's legit.
[1397.06 --> 1397.80]  That's very legit.
[1397.90 --> 1400.20]  Because he does so much of his gaming in his living room now.
[1400.42 --> 1400.94]  That's cool.
[1401.06 --> 1402.36]  On his 4K TV.
[1403.98 --> 1404.38]  Yeah.
[1404.80 --> 1405.20]  Anywho.
[1405.80 --> 1408.36]  So, so he's realistically going to be using.
[1409.52 --> 1410.42]  Upscaling, right?
[1410.56 --> 1413.56]  Like there's, there's no way he's gaming at 4K natively on that thing.
[1413.64 --> 1414.90]  So it's, it's upscale city.
[1415.10 --> 1421.42]  And then Plouffe is pulling his 4090 out and his monitor, which he owns by the way.
[1421.42 --> 1421.90]  He owns a monitor.
[1421.90 --> 1422.90]  He does own a monitor.
[1424.36 --> 1429.06]  One of those fancy 4K 240 Hertz displays from Alienware.
[1430.94 --> 1434.86]  So that's something that he'll be driving with a B580.
[1435.02 --> 1439.18]  So he's going to need all the fake upscaling nonsense that he can get.
[1439.18 --> 1440.60]  And he hates that stuff.
[1440.72 --> 1443.14]  Intel's kind of climbing uphill with this one, I think.
[1443.44 --> 1443.78]  Yes.
[1443.86 --> 1449.12]  But what I like about both of those guys as participants here is unlike me, they play a
[1449.12 --> 1450.32]  wide variety of games.
[1450.50 --> 1453.66]  So we are likely to, you know, find some edge cases.
[1453.82 --> 1454.18]  Oh, wow.
[1454.22 --> 1455.78]  It was actually fine in this one.
[1455.90 --> 1456.24]  Yes.
[1456.38 --> 1456.56]  Yeah.
[1456.64 --> 1456.78]  Yeah.
[1456.78 --> 1461.30]  And I got to say, you're going to see this in the video, obviously, once we upload it,
[1461.38 --> 1466.84]  but both of them were quite impressed by what they could achieve with it.
[1466.84 --> 1473.64]  When we did our quick test here in the studio before they embark on the 30-day B580 challenge.
[1473.72 --> 1474.66]  Good cards, man.
[1474.68 --> 1475.38]  They are good.
[1475.56 --> 1476.68]  They're legitimately good.
[1477.02 --> 1477.56]  Yeah.
[1477.72 --> 1483.74]  I just wish they were actually 250 bucks because then you could build a sick entry-level gaming
[1483.74 --> 1491.56]  PC for like $500, $600 and it would put downward pricing pressure on basically everything else
[1491.56 --> 1492.02]  in the market.
[1492.28 --> 1494.90]  We just need these bloody cards to be available.
[1495.24 --> 1496.60]  Still not getting a response on that.
[1496.60 --> 1501.60]  Speaking of 30-day challenges, I...
[1502.36 --> 1503.02]  Oh.
[1503.74 --> 1505.74]  Wait, I think we have to do a sponsor spot.
[1508.24 --> 1509.28]  This is another topic.
[1510.04 --> 1510.70]  Put that away.
[1510.94 --> 1512.00]  I think we have to do a sponsor spot.
[1512.00 --> 1512.58]  Put that away.
[1512.72 --> 1513.08]  It's gross.
[1513.18 --> 1513.58]  Get out of here.
[1514.96 --> 1515.26]  Okay.
[1515.38 --> 1516.20]  What are we supposed to do?
[1516.30 --> 1517.12]  We've got a sponsor spot.
[1517.62 --> 1517.94]  Okay.
[1518.78 --> 1519.52]  I am doing this one.
[1519.66 --> 1520.38]  Are you playing the thing?
[1520.40 --> 1521.26]  Am I doing it?
[1521.60 --> 1522.44]  It's got a read.
[1522.60 --> 1523.20]  I have no idea.
[1523.20 --> 1523.38]  Do I do it?
[1523.50 --> 1524.56]  I don't know.
[1524.72 --> 1524.90]  Okay.
[1525.00 --> 1525.88]  If we didn't...
[1525.88 --> 1527.40]  I thought Luke...
[1527.40 --> 1527.90]  Do you want to do it?
[1527.92 --> 1528.66]  I thought it was a special Luke one.
[1528.72 --> 1529.32]  Yeah, I can do it.
[1529.62 --> 1530.12]  It doesn't matter.
[1530.24 --> 1530.40]  Okay.
[1530.40 --> 1531.46]  This one is either of us.
[1531.52 --> 1532.48]  The second one I think is me.
[1533.08 --> 1533.42]  Oh.
[1534.02 --> 1535.28]  Super secret segment.
[1535.64 --> 1536.26]  No, not that.
[1536.48 --> 1536.68]  Okay.
[1536.74 --> 1538.60]  Let's get the sponsor spot done.
[1538.84 --> 1542.42]  Threat Locker is the sponsor of the WAN show today.
[1543.18 --> 1543.80]  Oh, look at you.
[1543.96 --> 1547.04]  Is your hand hovering over that phishing email again?
[1548.00 --> 1548.72]  Okay, Dennis.
[1548.80 --> 1550.36]  That is not how that works.
[1550.36 --> 1552.78]  The screen doesn't explode and break.
[1552.92 --> 1553.74]  You're pretty sick of it did.
[1553.74 --> 1558.18]  Or did an employee get tricked into clicking a malicious file?
[1558.96 --> 1559.78]  You can't blame them.
[1560.16 --> 1564.38]  Phishing emails are everywhere these days and they are harder than ever to spot.
[1564.72 --> 1568.90]  That's why our sponsor for the WAN show today, Threat Locker, takes a different approach.
[1569.44 --> 1574.14]  Instead of being reactive, they lock down your business with a default deny model.
[1574.26 --> 1576.18]  So only the software you approve can run.
[1576.38 --> 1577.78]  Everything else is simply blocked.
[1577.78 --> 1581.82]  This helps prevent malware, remote access attacks, and data theft.
[1582.20 --> 1588.28]  They have an entire endpoint protection platform and a whole suite of products with four of their most powerful ones being
[1588.28 --> 1595.98]  Allow Listing, where Threat Locker will automatically learn what's running in your environment and help you decide what applications to expressly permit.
[1595.98 --> 1602.60]  Ring fencing, which controls how applications interact with each other, your files, data, or the internet.
[1602.94 --> 1607.58]  This helps prevent attackers from weaponizing legitimate tools like PowerShell to exploit vulnerabilities.
[1608.34 --> 1611.66]  Network cloud, a host-based firewall that can be centrally managed.
[1611.90 --> 1612.30]  Network control.
[1612.86 --> 1613.72]  Did I say that?
[1613.88 --> 1614.58]  Network cloud.
[1614.76 --> 1614.94]  Nice.
[1614.94 --> 1616.92]  And cloud control.
[1617.22 --> 1617.90]  I was reading ahead.
[1617.90 --> 1626.40]  Which keeps your Microsoft 365 data protected by identifying whether a connection from a protected device originates from a trusted network.
[1626.84 --> 1630.20]  Plus, you can take all this control on the go with their mobile app.
[1630.52 --> 1638.32]  And they just rolled out new features at Zero Trust World 2025, or as I call it, the world 2025.
[1638.32 --> 1650.50]  Learn more about how Threat Locker can protect your business using the link in the description, and keep tuning into today's show to hear more about the new features they just announced.
[1651.04 --> 1651.18]  Yeah.
[1651.66 --> 1652.58]  All red.
[1652.84 --> 1655.32]  Do this right after Threat Locker.
[1656.64 --> 1658.28]  Super secret segment.
[1658.60 --> 1659.12]  Shh.
[1660.22 --> 1661.00]  It's a secret.
[1661.30 --> 1662.02]  Source, Luke, and Dan.
[1662.14 --> 1663.10]  Don't tell Linus.
[1663.14 --> 1664.72]  I literally have no idea what this is.
[1665.02 --> 1666.32]  What are you guys talking about?
[1666.34 --> 1667.34]  Okay, well, just me then.
[1667.34 --> 1667.58]  Wait, what?
[1667.64 --> 1668.26]  What's going on?
[1668.32 --> 1669.14]  And Sherrod is here?
[1669.24 --> 1669.94]  And Nick is here?
[1670.02 --> 1674.74]  Yeah, we have a special delivery that a friend is going to come in and deliver to you right this second.
[1674.88 --> 1677.28]  So if you want to come in and pass it over.
[1677.52 --> 1681.42]  Let's make sure the camera can see what you're looking at here.
[1684.24 --> 1686.02]  I genuinely have no idea.
[1686.02 --> 1687.20]  It says Source Luke.
[1687.60 --> 1687.92]  What?
[1688.08 --> 1688.92]  Yeah, but I don't know.
[1689.12 --> 1690.92]  It says Source Luke right here.
[1691.12 --> 1691.64]  And Dan.
[1691.94 --> 1692.70]  I don't know.
[1694.44 --> 1696.54]  You knew about it at one point, but you probably forgot.
[1696.94 --> 1697.34]  That's okay.
[1697.34 --> 1704.84]  I believe you, but I have zero memory of what this is supposed to be.
[1704.84 --> 1706.34]  Sorry, who knew about it at some point?
[1706.42 --> 1706.86]  He did or I did?
[1706.86 --> 1706.98]  Yeah.
[1706.98 --> 1707.64]  Apparently I did.
[1707.82 --> 1707.96]  Yeah.
[1707.98 --> 1709.00]  You did, but I didn't.
[1709.10 --> 1710.16]  No, you have no idea.
[1710.16 --> 1711.24]  Don't we know what it is for you?
[1711.24 --> 1713.38]  I don't know.
[1713.48 --> 1714.16]  No, I'm good.
[1714.34 --> 1714.62]  Okay.
[1715.24 --> 1715.50]  Ah!
[1715.82 --> 1716.22]  Whoa!
[1717.22 --> 1718.36]  Does it have money in it?
[1718.36 --> 1720.00]  Oh, yeah.
[1720.00 --> 1720.50]  Okay.
[1720.50 --> 1720.90]  Yeah.
[1722.36 --> 1725.10]  Oh, it's finally here!
[1725.60 --> 1728.42]  Oh, that's so cool.
[1728.48 --> 1730.02]  Wait, why does it have the meme picture on it?
[1730.02 --> 1733.40]  Oh, it's from Dbrand.
[1734.40 --> 1738.10]  Wait, why does Dbrand have our million order thing?
[1738.18 --> 1739.24]  What does that have to do with anything?
[1739.24 --> 1740.70]  They hacked the postal system.
[1740.88 --> 1742.20]  They hacked the postal system.
[1742.24 --> 1742.50]  What?
[1742.58 --> 1743.14]  What is this?
[1744.12 --> 1744.42]  Oh.
[1745.58 --> 1746.54]  What is this?
[1746.74 --> 1747.38]  That's for the lights.
[1747.38 --> 1747.92]  That's for the lights.
[1747.92 --> 1748.82]  Oh, for the lights.
[1748.88 --> 1749.12]  Okay.
[1749.22 --> 1749.48]  Okay.
[1749.58 --> 1751.24]  So there's a whole thing.
[1751.24 --> 1751.64]  Okay.
[1752.14 --> 1752.54]  All right.
[1752.60 --> 1753.06]  Thank you.
[1753.14 --> 1754.46]  BetterLTTstore.com.
[1754.46 --> 1756.62]  Yeah, Dbrand bought that domain a while back.
[1756.84 --> 1757.64]  Because they're big nerds.
[1758.50 --> 1758.90]  Ow!
[1759.12 --> 1759.94]  Oh, my fingers.
[1763.00 --> 1764.58]  Oh, that is so cool.
[1764.66 --> 1765.62]  This is it, guys.
[1765.62 --> 1771.18]  This is the Shopify equivalent of a YouTube play button.
[1772.00 --> 1773.28]  Much more exclusive, though.
[1773.38 --> 1781.66]  Congratulations, LTTstore, on reaching one million orders December 30th, 2024.
[1781.66 --> 1785.08]  Wow, it's freaking solid metal.
[1785.66 --> 1788.12]  At least it's got some solid metal in it.
[1788.34 --> 1788.96]  No, there's got to be.
[1789.68 --> 1791.02]  Oh, yeah, no, that is hollow metal.
[1791.12 --> 1791.72]  But it's metal.
[1792.32 --> 1793.78]  It's definitely some metal.
[1794.32 --> 1795.42]  Dude, that is so cool.
[1795.42 --> 1796.48]  That is absolutely, really cool.
[1797.44 --> 1798.42]  I'm going to put it on my wall.
[1799.36 --> 1800.64]  You have to leave that one here.
[1800.70 --> 1801.06]  I have to leave.
[1801.12 --> 1802.50]  What do you mean I have to leave this one here?
[1803.16 --> 1804.80]  We have a cardboard one for you to take home.
[1804.86 --> 1806.08]  What do you mean cardboard one?
[1806.10 --> 1807.28]  No, I want a gold one.
[1808.28 --> 1809.30]  Can I get a gold one?
[1809.32 --> 1810.06]  I want a gold one.
[1810.20 --> 1811.44]  You can spray paint the cardboard.
[1811.44 --> 1812.04]  What's that?
[1812.52 --> 1813.02]  Here's yours.
[1813.28 --> 1813.82]  What's that?
[1814.42 --> 1815.00]  These are yours.
[1815.08 --> 1815.82]  What's going on?
[1815.92 --> 1817.14]  You don't have to open it.
[1817.18 --> 1817.64]  It's the same thing.
[1817.94 --> 1818.20]  What?
[1818.80 --> 1819.94]  Oh, they're in the box.
[1820.28 --> 1821.64]  Oh, that makes sense.
[1821.78 --> 1822.66]  Yeah, it's not just a cardboard.
[1822.66 --> 1822.86]  Oh.
[1824.90 --> 1826.06]  It's going to get the Sharpie.
[1826.96 --> 1827.84]  Okay, well.
[1828.10 --> 1829.10]  He's opening it anyways.
[1829.30 --> 1831.26]  You guys want unboxing version two?
[1831.96 --> 1833.18]  This is in short circuit.
[1834.60 --> 1835.96]  Boxing peanuts, let's go!
[1836.72 --> 1837.28]  Free snacks.
[1838.32 --> 1839.54]  I can't open it.
[1839.60 --> 1840.58]  Don't hurt your elbow again.
[1840.58 --> 1843.96]  You've been doing cardio activities at the gym, but maybe it's time to incorporate...
[1843.96 --> 1845.64]  We don't give Linus sharp things.
[1846.00 --> 1846.56]  Oh, wow.
[1846.80 --> 1848.30]  Why is the tape so fine?
[1848.36 --> 1850.28]  You break it, smart guy.
[1850.54 --> 1852.36]  He's just going to shear it in half.
[1852.62 --> 1853.68]  That's shopped by quality.
[1853.68 --> 1856.00]  I softened it up for him.
[1856.18 --> 1857.30]  That was nothing, dude.
[1857.50 --> 1858.46]  I loosened it up.
[1858.46 --> 1859.40]  I can give you a routine.
[1859.40 --> 1860.18]  He has a shoulder injury.
[1860.18 --> 1860.60]  It'll be okay.
[1860.60 --> 1861.46]  It'll be nice to have...
[1861.46 --> 1862.72]  So do I.
[1863.36 --> 1864.28]  Where's this arm?
[1864.54 --> 1864.90]  Oh, yeah.
[1865.58 --> 1866.26]  Linus, you're weak.
[1866.42 --> 1867.64]  I loosened it up for him.
[1871.14 --> 1871.50]  Okay.
[1873.06 --> 1873.42]  Okay.
[1874.30 --> 1874.90]  What's in here?
[1874.96 --> 1875.60]  It could be different.
[1875.60 --> 1876.40]  Packing peanuts everywhere.
[1877.26 --> 1878.02]  It could be different.
[1878.64 --> 1879.14]  Oh, God.
[1879.44 --> 1880.00]  Oh, God.
[1880.18 --> 1880.62]  Oh, God.
[1880.66 --> 1881.82]  The packing peanuts are everywhere.
[1883.66 --> 1884.76]  I'll clean them up later.
[1884.86 --> 1885.26]  It's okay.
[1886.02 --> 1886.50]  What's this?
[1888.32 --> 1888.92]  What's this?
[1889.06 --> 1889.74]  Hold on.
[1889.76 --> 1890.72]  There's two things in here.
[1892.14 --> 1892.52]  Okay.
[1892.58 --> 1892.86]  All right.
[1892.94 --> 1893.84]  There's more than two things.
[1894.24 --> 1894.50]  Oh, yeah.
[1894.50 --> 1895.32]  There's some other stuff.
[1896.50 --> 1896.84]  Oh.
[1897.90 --> 1898.30]  Oh.
[1898.44 --> 1898.62]  Oh.
[1898.62 --> 1900.74]  We get the whole unboxing experience this time.
[1900.82 --> 1901.00]  Okay.
[1901.08 --> 1901.24]  Cool.
[1901.34 --> 1901.48]  Cool.
[1901.54 --> 1901.68]  Cool.
[1901.68 --> 1902.90]  So here you go, guys.
[1903.04 --> 1905.28]  This is the box that comes in.
[1906.10 --> 1906.50]  Oh.
[1906.72 --> 1906.92]  Oh.
[1907.72 --> 1911.36]  You get a Money Moves sticker pack.
[1912.42 --> 1913.48]  You get a...
[1913.48 --> 1914.70]  Very close to Mogul Moves.
[1915.20 --> 1915.52]  Yeah.
[1915.60 --> 1916.64]  I noticed that, actually.
[1917.44 --> 1918.56]  You get a...
[1918.56 --> 1920.24]  Whatever the crap this is.
[1922.02 --> 1923.12]  I can't tell if...
[1923.12 --> 1923.64]  Oh, yeah.
[1923.74 --> 1924.04]  Okay.
[1924.48 --> 1924.86]  There you go.
[1924.90 --> 1929.38]  You get a little, like, milestone card signed by Harley Finkelstein,
[1929.38 --> 1933.04]  who, I mean, yeah, sure.
[1933.48 --> 1934.22]  Probably less...
[1934.22 --> 1934.72]  President.
[1934.72 --> 1934.98]  President.
[1934.98 --> 1937.00]  Probably less controversial than Toby these days.
[1942.34 --> 1943.88]  Something special awaits.
[1945.96 --> 1946.36]  Okay.
[1946.36 --> 1947.18]  What else we got here?
[1947.74 --> 1948.94]  Professional unboxer, by the way.
[1948.96 --> 1949.50]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1949.58 --> 1949.84]  I'm a...
[1949.84 --> 1950.26]  Well, look.
[1950.36 --> 1954.20]  Normally, as a professional unboxer, I have a bloody table to, you know, put the thing on.
[1954.68 --> 1955.26]  There you go.
[1955.48 --> 1957.02]  There's our silver award.
[1957.02 --> 1963.86]  So I asked if, like YouTube, you can pay a little extra and get an additional copy of the award
[1963.86 --> 1968.26]  in case your narcissistic CEO needs to have one at his own house.
[1968.82 --> 1970.66]  And the answer, it turns out, was yes.
[1971.56 --> 1974.78]  Is it really, you know, a proper award if you have to buy it?
[1974.84 --> 1975.42]  I don't know.
[1975.58 --> 1976.24]  I think so.
[1976.44 --> 1977.32]  I still think so.
[1977.72 --> 1980.86]  How much do we have to pay to get another...
[1980.86 --> 1981.26]  Oh, wow.
[1981.34 --> 1981.96]  Product care.
[1982.46 --> 1983.16]  Look at that.
[1983.16 --> 1984.60]  It was like one, two, three or something.
[1984.60 --> 1984.96]  What?
[1986.84 --> 1987.20]  Wow.
[1987.40 --> 1987.92]  What a racket.
[1988.56 --> 1989.08]  All right.
[1989.30 --> 1989.84]  I don't know.
[1989.92 --> 1990.50]  I don't know.
[1990.70 --> 1990.96]  Okay.
[1991.26 --> 1992.62]  We apparently don't remember.
[1992.84 --> 1994.34]  We don't remember how much we paid for it.
[1994.34 --> 1995.00]  But there it is.
[1995.46 --> 1996.16]  LTT store.
[1996.62 --> 1997.68]  Silver and gold, baby.
[1997.92 --> 1998.88]  Do they have a higher tier?
[1999.26 --> 2001.26]  Would there have been an amount that you wouldn't have paid?
[2001.34 --> 2003.44]  Like, how much would you have not bought it at?
[2003.68 --> 2005.14]  I think that's why he probably doesn't know.
[2005.54 --> 2006.54]  Yeah, there's nothing.
[2006.54 --> 2010.28]  So we reached 100,000 December 20...
[2010.28 --> 2010.52]  Wait.
[2010.98 --> 2011.32]  Really?
[2011.58 --> 2011.98]  Wow.
[2012.06 --> 2013.88]  It was exactly four years apart?
[2014.26 --> 2015.88]  December 28th, 2020.
[2016.34 --> 2019.50]  And then a million December 30th, 2024.
[2019.98 --> 2021.98]  So how many people have one of these?
[2022.12 --> 2022.80]  Does anyone know?
[2024.44 --> 2024.90]  I don't know.
[2025.20 --> 2026.72]  You don't know or you're not allowed to say?
[2027.46 --> 2028.24]  Ah, okay.
[2028.50 --> 2029.88]  Oh, someone from Shopify is here.
[2030.02 --> 2030.52]  Okay, cool.
[2030.62 --> 2031.42]  Toby's controversial.
[2031.42 --> 2032.42]  Um...
[2032.42 --> 2035.86]  And are you allowed to say how many gold people?
[2037.22 --> 2037.50]  No.
[2038.04 --> 2038.84]  But can you say...
[2038.84 --> 2039.88]  It's an exclusive club.
[2040.10 --> 2044.30]  Can you say if it's fewer than, like, YouTube gold play buttons?
[2044.48 --> 2045.20]  I would think so.
[2045.28 --> 2045.66]  Nice.
[2045.78 --> 2046.00]  Yeah.
[2046.20 --> 2046.64]  Nice.
[2046.66 --> 2048.18]  I would think by a lot, to be honest.
[2048.50 --> 2048.84]  Nice.
[2048.98 --> 2049.92]  Also, it's okay.
[2049.98 --> 2050.96]  I have a terrible boss, too.
[2053.10 --> 2054.82]  I mean, I'm not his boss, so whatever.
[2055.38 --> 2056.02]  I don't care.
[2056.26 --> 2057.32]  Oh, no, he's deflected it.
[2057.36 --> 2058.24]  No, it's bad.
[2059.08 --> 2060.10]  Technically, that didn't even go to me.
[2060.10 --> 2062.00]  If I am your terrible boss, it wasn't me.
[2062.10 --> 2062.52]  Wait, no.
[2062.66 --> 2063.70]  Or you deserved it.
[2065.06 --> 2067.04]  Yeah, we're bad at being narcissists.
[2067.06 --> 2067.88]  I forget how it goes.
[2068.62 --> 2069.38]  Speak for yourself.
[2069.66 --> 2070.54]  I'm great at it.
[2070.74 --> 2071.20]  There you go.
[2071.22 --> 2071.68]  Thanks, Nick.
[2072.34 --> 2072.74]  Bye.
[2072.94 --> 2073.80]  All right, cool.
[2073.98 --> 2074.68]  Thank you.
[2074.80 --> 2075.20]  Shopify.
[2075.62 --> 2076.02]  Congratulations.
[2076.56 --> 2077.84]  Oh, thank you very much.
[2078.08 --> 2078.82]  Thanks so much.
[2078.82 --> 2079.86]  Nice to meet you.
[2080.40 --> 2081.16]  Do I still have one?
[2081.24 --> 2081.70]  Yeah, okay.
[2081.92 --> 2082.90]  Ah, so cool.
[2082.90 --> 2086.10]  I can't wait to put little shelves on my award wall and put them on it.
[2086.88 --> 2088.64]  Ah, that's so cool.
[2088.64 --> 2091.12]  A million freaking orders.
[2091.34 --> 2092.00]  That's pretty nuts.
[2092.64 --> 2093.48]  Wild, dude.
[2093.60 --> 2096.60]  Didn't we have something like less than 100 in 2018?
[2097.84 --> 2099.48]  It's come a long way.
[2100.14 --> 2101.96]  Yeah, that probably sounds about right.
[2101.96 --> 2102.78]  Less than 100 or 100,000.
[2102.96 --> 2105.64]  No, in 2018, like...
[2105.64 --> 2107.64]  We started the store basically in 2019.
[2108.08 --> 2108.52]  2019?
[2108.72 --> 2108.96]  Yeah.
[2108.96 --> 2110.28]  Yeah, I think it was available in 2018.
[2110.28 --> 2113.36]  Yeah, so it's gone through.
[2113.46 --> 2117.24]  As you guys are about to see in the 2020...
[2117.24 --> 2120.14]  Nick's holding the other gold one over there.
[2120.62 --> 2123.40]  As you guys are about to see in the...
[2123.40 --> 2125.02]  Oh, I was just about to turn it on.
[2125.12 --> 2125.54]  There we go.
[2125.76 --> 2126.88]  We figured it out.
[2127.32 --> 2127.74]  In the...
[2127.74 --> 2128.90]  How does LMG make money?
[2130.18 --> 2130.62]  Update.
[2130.62 --> 2133.66]  Creator Warehouse.
[2133.82 --> 2134.86]  The LTT store.
[2136.36 --> 2137.10]  It's a lot.
[2137.54 --> 2137.90]  Has...
[2137.90 --> 2140.46]  I mean, Floatplane has grown in share.
[2140.88 --> 2141.16]  Yay!
[2141.32 --> 2141.84]  In the pie.
[2142.22 --> 2143.34]  You guys are going to see that.
[2143.48 --> 2145.66]  So, massive shout out to the Floatplane team.
[2145.82 --> 2148.80]  And our floaters who are watching on Floatplane right now in the live chat.
[2148.88 --> 2149.78]  Thank you very much, guys.
[2150.20 --> 2150.90]  They have grown.
[2150.90 --> 2156.94]  LTT store has grown a lot.
[2158.52 --> 2162.46]  AdSense makes up a shockingly small amount of our revenue.
[2162.60 --> 2163.34]  Have you seen the pie?
[2163.68 --> 2164.04]  Yeah.
[2164.20 --> 2164.78]  You've seen the pie chart?
[2164.84 --> 2167.34]  I'm not going to show you guys the pie chart because I'm going to make you wait for the video.
[2167.74 --> 2171.04]  I think it's going to be genuinely stunning for people that don't do this.
[2171.28 --> 2176.88]  I think it's going to be genuinely stunning for our YouTube contacts to realize how little
[2176.88 --> 2180.02]  of our company's revenue comes from AdSense.
[2180.36 --> 2180.56]  Yeah.
[2180.56 --> 2187.58]  I think that depending on who you talk to at YouTube, they think they swing a really big
[2187.58 --> 2191.68]  dick in terms of their effectiveness for creator monetization.
[2191.84 --> 2192.64]  Some of them get it.
[2193.60 --> 2197.56]  And there are other ones that are like, yeah, no, no, we know.
[2198.34 --> 2201.52]  We know and we're figuring out how to kind of work on it.
[2201.60 --> 2203.46]  But I've had conversations there.
[2203.68 --> 2205.58]  I think stuff like shopping is a step in the right direction.
[2205.86 --> 2206.28]  Absolutely.
[2206.28 --> 2211.22]  I mean, that's something I've been pushing them for for eight, nine years.
[2211.40 --> 2216.44]  Like, hey, guys, you need to get over whatever the ego is that prevents you from working with
[2216.44 --> 2217.72]  other big tech brands.
[2217.72 --> 2220.36]  And you need to just like figure this out.
[2220.44 --> 2223.84]  You need to just integrate this stuff in the platform because TikTok came in and just ate
[2223.84 --> 2224.54]  their lunch on it.
[2225.14 --> 2228.24]  And and so I think there's there's some of them that are going to figure it out.
[2228.28 --> 2229.56]  But there's other ones that I've talked to.
[2229.62 --> 2235.88]  And I basically said, hey, yeah, I couldn't help noticing that your your monetization efficiency
[2235.88 --> 2242.32]  compared to what, you know, our business team who, you know, quite frankly, is great.
[2242.72 --> 2243.66]  They work hard.
[2243.80 --> 2244.84]  They're personable.
[2245.02 --> 2246.34]  They understand our product.
[2246.44 --> 2247.68]  They understand our processes.
[2247.98 --> 2249.18]  They they build relationships.
[2249.18 --> 2250.56]  They do a lot of really good stuff.
[2251.32 --> 2255.08]  But every single one of them, we basically just recruited off the street, essentially.
[2255.08 --> 2260.88]  Like we didn't bring in like seasoned industries, you know, advertising industry salespeople.
[2261.06 --> 2262.10]  They're just like guys.
[2262.20 --> 2263.86]  They're just like a bunch of gamer bros.
[2263.86 --> 2272.22]  The fact that they are so dramatically outperforming from like an RPM standpoint, like like a revenue
[2272.22 --> 2278.94]  per thousand views standpoint, AdSense to me means that AdSense is not that great.
[2278.94 --> 2281.68]  Not that we are like magic rock stars.
[2281.96 --> 2287.62]  To me, it means that if Google just across the board said, hey, yeah, your AdSense bids
[2287.62 --> 2288.42]  need to be higher.
[2288.74 --> 2293.48]  Do you think it has to do with skippable, like the skip button on ads?
[2293.48 --> 2294.44]  And ad blocker?
[2295.34 --> 2298.72]  Um, no, because it's.
[2301.48 --> 2308.84]  I think it probably partially contributes, especially on a more tech savvy channel like
[2308.84 --> 2313.84]  ours, where people have the because like, I think the percentage of people that are annoyed
[2313.84 --> 2318.16]  by ads is probably the same across a cooking channel and our channel.
[2318.16 --> 2323.28]  But the percentage of people who could take that annoyance and turn it into a piehole deployment
[2323.28 --> 2325.46]  is going to be a lot higher for us.
[2325.46 --> 2325.74]  Right.
[2326.04 --> 2330.54]  Well, like we, I think we talked about this in the pre-show, but, uh, Firefox very recently,
[2330.54 --> 2336.26]  like mega fumbled a, a update to their, their, what was it?
[2336.34 --> 2337.46]  Terms and conditions or something.
[2337.60 --> 2337.70]  Yeah.
[2337.70 --> 2345.32]  Um, and, and then their, their like response to mega fumbling that was also not amazing,
[2345.32 --> 2349.18]  even though it sounds like it's like probably not a huge deal.
[2349.30 --> 2349.76]  Relatable.
[2350.08 --> 2351.74]  Their response was really bad.
[2351.74 --> 2358.18]  Um, and what I've seen as a result of this is a lot of people switching from Firefox to
[2358.18 --> 2364.04]  Brave and also other people discovering that Brave exists, like Chrome users seeing the
[2364.04 --> 2366.72]  Firefox news cycle and going, Oh, what is this Brave thing?
[2367.20 --> 2372.04]  Um, and Brave has, as far as my understanding goes, I've never actually used it, has native
[2372.04 --> 2373.48]  ad blocking built into the browser.
[2373.48 --> 2378.82]  Um, so like, yeah.
[2379.14 --> 2379.38]  Yeah.
[2379.50 --> 2383.32]  Brave is, uh, they also have, don't they have their like attention token and stuff too?
[2383.40 --> 2385.88]  Like I, I forget exactly how all of that works.
[2385.88 --> 2387.86]  So don't, don't, don't quote me on it.
[2387.86 --> 2388.62]  I don't know.
[2389.06 --> 2389.58]  I don't know.
[2389.60 --> 2389.76]  Yeah.
[2389.76 --> 2394.18]  So let's not get into it if we don't sort of fully understand what their, what their
[2394.18 --> 2394.72]  model is.
[2394.84 --> 2400.58]  But, uh, anyway, the point, the point that I was trying to make is just that, um, you
[2400.58 --> 2405.66]  know, to, to some of the people I talk at, talk at, talk to at Google, sometimes it does
[2405.66 --> 2406.66]  feel like talking at people.
[2406.82 --> 2412.84]  Some of the people I talk to at Google, they look at, you know, our, our, our business team's
[2412.84 --> 2417.94]  ability to monetize and they go, well, that's just, you know, your sponsors must be stupid
[2417.94 --> 2418.74]  to pay that much.
[2418.80 --> 2422.06]  I've literally heard that response from people at YouTube.
[2422.68 --> 2426.30]  Whereas others look at that and they go, Oh, we're dropping the ball on that.
[2426.56 --> 2426.92]  Yeah.
[2426.92 --> 2430.94]  Because we could be doing five X, 10 X the RPM.
[2430.94 --> 2433.12]  I mean, we know creators, not just in other segments.
[2433.26 --> 2437.64]  We know creators in similar segments that are charging, uh, more per like view.
[2437.88 --> 2438.06]  Yep.
[2438.20 --> 2440.66]  So like what are you even talking about?
[2440.84 --> 2441.18]  Absolutely.
[2441.46 --> 2445.28]  And, and the thing is like, again, I don't want to take anything away from our business
[2445.28 --> 2450.18]  team because they work hard and they really do take the time.
[2450.18 --> 2452.90]  They take the time to understand the brand.
[2452.90 --> 2459.42]  They take the time to understand our voice and our brand and, and our lines in the sand
[2459.42 --> 2461.24]  where we're just like, no, we're not going to do that.
[2461.30 --> 2462.04]  We're not going to cross that.
[2462.08 --> 2463.36]  They take the time to understand that.
[2463.44 --> 2465.46]  They take the time to bridge that gap and that's work.
[2465.84 --> 2466.22]  Right.
[2466.96 --> 2473.36]  But I also don't think that, you know, none of them have a PhD in ad sales, you know?
[2473.50 --> 2475.58]  So I think this is replicatable.
[2475.58 --> 2479.20]  Um, I think it, I think it could be done if you take the time.
[2481.38 --> 2484.98]  Um, all right.
[2485.02 --> 2486.24]  What are we supposed to be talking about?
[2486.48 --> 2488.04]  I think whatever we want.
[2488.26 --> 2488.68]  Cool.
[2488.84 --> 2489.46]  Oh, your Mac.
[2490.48 --> 2490.84]  Ugh.
[2491.44 --> 2492.62]  It's time.
[2492.88 --> 2493.42]  All right.
[2493.46 --> 2494.16]  Let's do it.
[2494.24 --> 2499.58]  So here's my, here's the title for this segment.
[2499.58 --> 2508.44]  Mac OS is great unless you try to use it as a desktop operating system.
[2508.62 --> 2517.44]  Oh, because my experience using the Mac book actually pretty solid as long as I use it as
[2517.44 --> 2518.00]  a Mac book.
[2518.00 --> 2523.04]  But one of the things that I noted on the shopping video where I went through all of my different
[2523.04 --> 2529.86]  options was a prevailing sentiment from the audience was Linus right out of the gate.
[2529.96 --> 2530.84]  You're doing this wrong.
[2531.70 --> 2536.74]  Nobody buys a Mac mini and a Mac book like two cheap devices.
[2537.70 --> 2542.40]  Anyone with an ounce of sense would buy one good Mac book and then a doc.
[2542.86 --> 2547.36]  And so I kind of went, okay, that actually works pretty, pretty well for my, for my month
[2547.36 --> 2553.02]  experiment because I don't really need to switch because I wanted to use my Mac at home.
[2553.04 --> 2556.38]  And so what I'm going to go by like three Macs now.
[2556.44 --> 2556.56]  No.
[2556.70 --> 2561.90]  So no, what I'm going to do is I'm going to deploy the Mac mini at home and then at work
[2561.90 --> 2570.50]  where I carry a backpack, commuter backpack, LTT store.com where I carry commuter backpack.
[2570.76 --> 2573.32]  Anyway, I'm just going to carry my Mac book around.
[2573.52 --> 2576.16]  I'm going to dock it in my office and then use it as a laptop.
[2576.48 --> 2580.66]  And what's been really nice about that is that I never have to think about charging this
[2580.66 --> 2582.90]  thing because it charges whenever I'm docked.
[2583.04 --> 2586.20]  I've got all my peripherals plugged in and the whole thing is really seamless.
[2587.38 --> 2588.24]  In theory.
[2589.52 --> 2599.04]  This is the part where we get into what is just two days of notes and is already like two
[2599.04 --> 2606.90]  full pages of densely formatted text in my, what things are like switching to Mac OS.
[2606.90 --> 2607.90]  And you know what?
[2607.98 --> 2609.18]  I want to preface this.
[2611.18 --> 2613.62]  Calm the fuck down.
[2613.96 --> 2616.54]  This segment was helpful when we did the iPhones.
[2617.04 --> 2623.06]  I want to preface this by saying a lot of these things I haven't even looked into a fix yet.
[2623.06 --> 2630.94]  Because right now what I'm doing is I am experiencing Mac OS as it is out of the box.
[2631.22 --> 2631.34]  Yeah.
[2631.64 --> 2632.02]  Okay.
[2632.44 --> 2636.14]  Well, actually there are a couple of things I've had to fix already because I just could
[2636.14 --> 2637.46]  not handle it.
[2637.46 --> 2642.02]  But for the most part I haven't even tried to find mitigations yet.
[2642.38 --> 2647.88]  So that doesn't mean don't pipe in in the chat with your ideas about how I could fix them.
[2648.68 --> 2649.08]  Absolutely.
[2649.30 --> 2653.76]  I want to see that because I want to have the best possible Mac OS experience.
[2653.76 --> 2659.14]  I'm just saying that if I say something that it turns out is not the case, it might be that
[2659.14 --> 2660.16]  I had a weird edge case.
[2660.24 --> 2662.52]  It might be that I, you know, haven't Googled it yet.
[2663.76 --> 2664.94]  These are raw notes.
[2665.16 --> 2665.94]  They're raw notes.
[2669.68 --> 2670.60]  Unlocking with the watch.
[2671.10 --> 2671.64]  Pretty nice.
[2672.76 --> 2676.92]  It's one of those things where like, would I buy a watch expressly for that purpose?
[2677.16 --> 2678.04]  Absolutely not.
[2678.28 --> 2683.02]  But it is pretty convenient to just like sit down at my desk and my computer's unlocked.
[2683.24 --> 2683.72]  Because you're close.
[2683.90 --> 2684.04]  Yeah.
[2684.12 --> 2688.64]  I mean, it's a lot more expensive than a webcam with Windows Hello face recognition.
[2688.82 --> 2689.12]  But like...
[2689.12 --> 2690.08]  Webcam that's already built in anyways.
[2690.24 --> 2690.52]  Yeah.
[2690.64 --> 2693.06]  Well, I mean, well, this uses Touch ID.
[2694.78 --> 2696.64]  So you just press the power button anyway.
[2697.20 --> 2700.74]  Unless you dock and then don't press the power button.
[2700.86 --> 2704.46]  But then also like managing the screen is a pain in the butt.
[2705.12 --> 2707.06]  Like, have you used a Mac recently?
[2707.36 --> 2707.64]  No.
[2708.06 --> 2708.30]  Okay.
[2708.40 --> 2708.76]  So when...
[2708.76 --> 2709.54]  Well, okay.
[2709.54 --> 2713.70]  My, the like nice lady that lives across the hall.
[2713.76 --> 2715.60]  Sometimes has computer problems and she has a Mac.
[2715.68 --> 2716.50]  So I try to fix them.
[2716.60 --> 2719.00]  But like, you know, I'm not using it for my own stuff.
[2719.04 --> 2725.00]  Did you know that if you plug in an external display and leave this open, you cannot turn
[2725.00 --> 2725.48]  this off?
[2725.48 --> 2730.90]  The only way to turn it off is to close it and leave it docked.
[2731.22 --> 2734.84]  The computer will stay on and you don't have to configure anything for that behavior.
[2735.04 --> 2737.98]  But your only options are mirror and extend.
[2737.98 --> 2740.82]  You can't just be like, no.
[2740.82 --> 2741.66]  Weird.
[2741.86 --> 2742.76]  Be off now.
[2743.20 --> 2743.52]  Odd.
[2743.52 --> 2750.28]  And dude, I cannot, I cannot actually believe that this is still a thing, but the way that
[2750.28 --> 2757.52]  it handles resolution configuration, you do not configure a display resolution and then
[2757.52 --> 2758.42]  configure scaling.
[2758.90 --> 2766.42]  You just set a resolution and it outputs the native resolution of the display, but scales
[2766.42 --> 2768.80]  it as if it were that.
[2768.80 --> 2770.92]  Does it at least tell you what the native is?
[2772.62 --> 2777.56]  So I've had, I don't know if it's my dock or if it's just macOS being a giant steaming
[2777.56 --> 2779.48]  pile of garbage, but sometimes.
[2779.48 --> 2781.00]  Sometimes docks can confuse things.
[2781.06 --> 2786.02]  Sometimes when I plug in, it knows that 4K is the maximum and remembers that the last
[2786.02 --> 2789.40]  time I configured it to 4K so that I have lots and lots of screen real estate.
[2789.56 --> 2793.34]  And sometimes it comes up with these like oddball rando resolutions.
[2793.34 --> 2797.76]  Uh, it doesn't seem to be related to which port, which are my two ports I plug into.
[2797.98 --> 2801.60]  So I, um, I'm not ready to, not ready to make a statement.
[2801.84 --> 2801.86]  Yeah.
[2801.92 --> 2802.02]  Yeah.
[2802.26 --> 2803.38]  Let's go through some of your things.
[2803.86 --> 2804.82]  Well, I mean, I am.
[2805.10 --> 2805.98]  That's what I'm doing.
[2806.16 --> 2806.98]  That's one of them.
[2807.16 --> 2812.36]  So, um, but what's inconvenient about that is that say I had a display like my one that
[2812.36 --> 2817.84]  I have, which is a 4K 165 Hertz display or 144 Hertz or something like that.
[2817.84 --> 2819.10]  That's your work desk monitor.
[2819.28 --> 2819.44]  Yeah.
[2819.52 --> 2821.50]  It's a 42 inch OLED.
[2821.76 --> 2822.06]  All right.
[2822.06 --> 2822.86]  I only have one.
[2823.04 --> 2823.44]  Okay.
[2823.88 --> 2825.58]  Do you, how many monitors do you have at work?
[2828.02 --> 2829.92]  Well, across both my desks.
[2829.92 --> 2830.22]  Okay.
[2830.34 --> 2830.64]  Yes.
[2830.72 --> 2831.20]  I have three.
[2831.36 --> 2831.60]  Okay.
[2831.62 --> 2832.50]  So I have one monitor.
[2832.62 --> 2834.02]  So calm, so calm down.
[2834.50 --> 2835.56]  So I have one monitor.
[2835.64 --> 2837.06]  It's a nice monitor, but it's one monitor.
[2837.50 --> 2840.34]  So on a PC, I would be able to make a choice.
[2840.38 --> 2843.78]  Let's say I had a slower, you know, earlier generation HDMI link.
[2843.78 --> 2846.54]  I could say, okay, hey, run it at 1080p.
[2847.08 --> 2852.70]  Let the display scale or use like four to one pixel perfect, uh, integer scaling.
[2852.70 --> 2853.66]  That's the word I'm looking for.
[2853.66 --> 2855.82]  Uh, and then run it at 120 Hertz.
[2856.16 --> 2858.40]  Or I could say run it 4K, run it 60 Hertz.
[2858.54 --> 2859.80]  Uh, I'd rather have the resolution.
[2860.26 --> 2863.62]  On a Mac, I cannot find an obvious way to do that.
[2863.62 --> 2865.20]  And I will look, I will look into it.
[2865.54 --> 2869.48]  Uh, someone sending me a synaptics product display link graphics.
[2869.64 --> 2869.92]  Yeah.
[2870.18 --> 2870.72]  Uh, okay.
[2870.72 --> 2874.72]  I'm going to have to, who knows, um, I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to like
[2874.72 --> 2876.48]  start making some notes here, guys.
[2877.10 --> 2877.98]  Uh, oh my goodness.
[2878.04 --> 2879.12]  Chat's moving too fast.
[2879.76 --> 2885.10]  Um, anyway, on Mac OS, there's not an obvious way for me to deal with that.
[2885.36 --> 2888.10]  And that's pretty, that's pretty frustrating.
[2888.36 --> 2894.24]  I can't find an obvious way to even configure, uh, 120 Hertz in the first place.
[2894.82 --> 2900.68]  Like my external monitor just runs at 60 Hertz, but I can't tell if that's because the
[2900.68 --> 2903.90]  HDMI port on my dock is limited to that or not.
[2903.90 --> 2907.94]  So I, I haven't really, I haven't really looked into that in detail yet.
[2909.38 --> 2910.22]  Uh, all right.
[2910.28 --> 2911.66]  So what, what else we got here?
[2911.76 --> 2914.16]  Oh my God.
[2914.36 --> 2914.72]  Okay.
[2914.72 --> 2917.90]  This makes me legitimately extremely angry.
[2918.26 --> 2924.98]  Um, so Luke, go ahead and like scroll this document, you know, in a way that you would,
[2925.10 --> 2927.06]  you know, two fingers on the trackpad, you know, like you would.
[2927.44 --> 2927.72]  Okay.
[2927.74 --> 2928.54]  That feels right.
[2928.60 --> 2928.78]  Right.
[2929.32 --> 2929.74]  Okay.
[2929.74 --> 2933.20]  So that is Apple's natural scrolling, right?
[2933.66 --> 2937.62]  So where up is down and down is up like it was a touchscreen.
[2937.92 --> 2938.24]  Okay.
[2938.54 --> 2938.88]  Okay.
[2939.30 --> 2940.84]  And that's the default behavior.
[2941.34 --> 2944.62]  But if you haven't used a Mac in a while, you might not know this.
[2944.80 --> 2947.72]  Um, if you plug in a mouse, it's the same.
[2948.74 --> 2955.84]  Down is up and up is down on the scroll wheel, which no, is not how that's ever worked in the
[2955.84 --> 2959.38]  history of anything other than on Apple's like touch mice.
[2960.92 --> 2961.36]  Okay.
[2961.52 --> 2962.58]  You can change that.
[2963.10 --> 2963.82]  No problem.
[2964.02 --> 2964.20]  Okay.
[2964.26 --> 2964.98]  You can change that.
[2965.10 --> 2968.30]  You can change it from natural to not natural.
[2968.30 --> 2974.66]  But if you change the toggle for your mouse, it changes it for your touchpad.
[2974.66 --> 2979.22]  And if you change it for your touchpad, it changes it for your mouse.
[2979.34 --> 2981.14]  Oh my God.
[2981.62 --> 2982.10]  Why?
[2984.76 --> 2985.40]  That's pretty.
[2985.40 --> 2986.72]  Like why?
[2987.28 --> 2988.86]  They are not the same thing.
[2990.02 --> 2993.92]  Uh, people are pointing out, uh, you can use linear mouse or another free software.
[2994.14 --> 2995.60]  It won't toggle both.
[2995.96 --> 2999.84]  Um, yes, I will, I will note that down and I will use that.
[2999.84 --> 3002.90]  I should not have to do that.
[3003.62 --> 3008.94]  That should be a thing that just be, and the stupidest part is that if you go into the system
[3008.94 --> 3011.68]  settings, they are two completely separate menus.
[3011.88 --> 3013.30]  There's one for trackpad.
[3013.40 --> 3019.34]  And when you have a mouse plugged in, the mouse menu appears and you go in there and that option
[3019.34 --> 3019.78]  is there.
[3020.08 --> 3027.46]  They are two separate sub menus, but when you change them in one, it changes it in the other
[3027.46 --> 3027.76]  one.
[3027.76 --> 3033.54]  I find it kind of interesting because windows is kind of like last place right now in regards
[3033.54 --> 3040.40]  to, in my opinion, how often people do customizations to OS functionality.
[3041.86 --> 3044.58]  Not that that's a race that you necessarily want to win.
[3044.68 --> 3045.06]  I don't know.
[3045.16 --> 3052.14]  But like, I, I never really hear people talking about like, uh, I don't know, like rain meters
[3052.14 --> 3056.20]  more just like stylistic, but there's been a lot of things over the years that you can do
[3056.20 --> 3058.16]  to windows to make it work in different ways.
[3058.50 --> 3064.66]  Um, and Linux is obviously somewhat famous for it, but you always hear, like if you express
[3064.66 --> 3070.48]  any issue with Mac, people know about some app probably paid that you can get, that'll
[3070.48 --> 3071.04]  solve your problem.
[3071.12 --> 3074.98]  It might be like three bucks or something like it's probably not a huge deal, but damn.
[3074.98 --> 3075.02]  Yeah.
[3075.60 --> 3080.94]  I just, I shouldn't need that to, to do something that Apple literally built the functionality
[3080.94 --> 3085.22]  for, but then just decided to half our sit.
[3085.80 --> 3089.72]  Um, oh man, here's, here's one that I, here's one that I had to fix right away.
[3089.94 --> 3094.90]  I do think this, uh, this Moss thing that people are linking, I think it's free and open source.
[3094.98 --> 3096.58]  So that's, yeah, that's cool.
[3096.68 --> 3099.52]  I installed sensible side buttons on the first day.
[3099.90 --> 3101.12]  Sensible side buttons.
[3101.22 --> 3101.46]  Yep.
[3101.46 --> 3108.70]  Um, because by default, my, my third party mouse, just a Logitech super light, um, didn't
[3108.70 --> 3111.02]  have back and forward functionality on the side buttons.
[3111.76 --> 3112.98]  They just didn't do anything.
[3113.16 --> 3120.56]  It's like brother, the first mouse I ever owned with a side button on it to go back in
[3120.56 --> 3125.56]  the browser and in file explorer and stuff worked immediately came out in 2003.
[3125.56 --> 3140.78]  That was, I kid you not, 22 years ago to plug in a mouse and not have it immediately, immediately
[3140.78 --> 3146.62]  understand back and forward is well, insane.
[3146.90 --> 3148.38]  It's not sensible there.
[3148.50 --> 3149.50]  That's what I was looking for.
[3149.54 --> 3150.44]  It's not sensible.
[3150.84 --> 3154.16]  So I have a third party app that will fix that.
[3154.16 --> 3156.58]  Uh, someone says not even with Logitech options installed.
[3156.74 --> 3158.56]  I don't care.
[3159.22 --> 3165.08]  No, no other Linux windows, like fucking Android.
[3165.38 --> 3165.54]  Okay.
[3165.54 --> 3169.12]  You could plug in a mouse and the basic buttons will work.
[3169.20 --> 3169.60]  Yeah, sure.
[3169.64 --> 3172.22]  You're like macro functionality or whatever, probably won't.
[3172.38 --> 3175.32]  And you know how sensible side buttons works.
[3175.46 --> 3182.32]  It emulates like a three finger swipe because the functionality doesn't appear to exist for
[3182.32 --> 3183.88]  the mouse in Mac OS.
[3184.98 --> 3187.26]  That's just negligent.
[3187.98 --> 3190.10]  That is negligent.
[3190.76 --> 3194.50]  Uh, W Calderini says, Apple really, really, really wants you to use the Apple mouse.
[3194.54 --> 3195.30]  And that's nice.
[3195.34 --> 3198.64]  And if they want that, then they should build a mouse that doesn't destroy my wrist.
[3199.26 --> 3200.74]  That's not an option for me.
[3200.80 --> 3202.04]  I literally will not.
[3202.14 --> 3205.08]  Or you need to like help this turtle in order to charge it.
[3205.20 --> 3206.20]  Cause you still have to do that.
[3206.22 --> 3206.50]  Don't you?
[3206.50 --> 3207.14]  Yes.
[3208.82 --> 3211.72]  Um, this is great.
[3211.82 --> 3216.22]  Uh, one of my notes says repeat rate is so slow for keys like backspace.
[3216.42 --> 3217.10]  Oh my God.
[3217.10 --> 3218.64]  I need third party software.
[3218.64 --> 3226.70]  Uh, dude, holding down the backspace, excuse me, delete key is infuriating.
[3227.14 --> 3233.70]  I am like, I am literally like dying as I wait for the cursor to nom up all the characters
[3233.70 --> 3234.22]  that I've typed.
[3234.32 --> 3237.70]  Uh, it looks like I need third party software for that, but I have not really looked that.
[3237.80 --> 3238.60]  I've not looked that.
[3238.60 --> 3239.12]  Of course.
[3239.12 --> 3243.68]  Let's see what else we got.
[3244.24 --> 3247.34]  Um, but, but, but I ran into a super weird bug.
[3247.46 --> 3249.42]  Oh, I, I, did I pull you in to show you this?
[3250.40 --> 3251.96]  The, the text clarity bug?
[3252.04 --> 3253.16]  No, I think I did.
[3253.32 --> 3254.02]  Yeah, dude.
[3254.10 --> 3255.08]  That was very odd.
[3255.14 --> 3255.56]  That was weird.
[3255.62 --> 3256.92]  I took a video on my iPhone.
[3257.10 --> 3258.90]  I, I'm not going to send it to you guys right now.
[3259.24 --> 3259.98]  I understand what even happened.
[3260.04 --> 3260.24]  Yeah.
[3260.28 --> 3265.00]  Like the, the browser rendering, like completely bunged up, but only a part of it.
[3265.32 --> 3266.12]  Super buggy.
[3266.20 --> 3267.40]  It was only in certain tabs.
[3267.46 --> 3268.76]  So it was definitely browser related.
[3268.76 --> 3269.96]  It seems like a Safari bug.
[3270.04 --> 3274.74]  And I'm, yes, I'm using Safari because I am having, that's its own challenge.
[3274.86 --> 3276.08]  The Mac experience.
[3276.20 --> 3279.46]  That is speaking of, um, speaking of rendering issues.
[3279.48 --> 3280.56]  They stole their browsers on a Mac.
[3280.56 --> 3281.86]  Here, I should send, I'll send this one.
[3281.90 --> 3282.94]  I'll send this one to Dan.
[3283.10 --> 3284.10]  This will be a teaser.
[3284.24 --> 3288.94]  Like, dude, Apple, seriously, this is a genuine conflicts of interest.
[3289.10 --> 3289.68]  Be damned.
[3290.32 --> 3297.26]  Apple, I am genuinely offering to come in and work for you guys for a week as a consultant.
[3297.26 --> 3297.44]  Mm-hmm.
[3297.44 --> 3308.42]  I will give you a to-do list of just sensible ass fixes that you guys can make to macOS that will genuinely improve the experience of your product.
[3308.42 --> 3310.24]  I will do it for free.
[3311.32 --> 3312.98]  I will come down to Cupertino.
[3312.98 --> 3314.78]  Cupertino.
[3314.78 --> 3315.82]  I will do it for free.
[3315.82 --> 3327.98]  And I guarantee you, based on how much stuff that I found, in like three hours, it will be some of the most valuable time that your developers have ever spent with anyone.
[3328.10 --> 3329.74]  Because I don't know what it is.
[3329.74 --> 3332.38]  Is it that your users are afraid to tell you this stuff?
[3332.66 --> 3336.18]  Or that they just, or that your staff doesn't care?
[3336.32 --> 3341.06]  Or people are just so used to these stupid workarounds that they just, they don't see them anymore?
[3341.16 --> 3343.72]  I don't know what it is, but you clearly need an outsider's perspective.
[3343.96 --> 3346.98]  Because the fact that, Dan, check this out.
[3347.16 --> 3348.38]  What the heck?
[3348.48 --> 3348.78]  No.
[3348.78 --> 3351.78]  Did you see the thing I just sent you in Teams?
[3351.92 --> 3352.08]  Yeah.
[3352.30 --> 3353.26]  Okay, so bring it up.
[3353.56 --> 3354.22]  I'm upset.
[3355.36 --> 3357.38]  I didn't realize he had sent you something.
[3357.58 --> 3358.22]  So when he was like.
[3358.56 --> 3359.58]  Steve Jobs.
[3359.82 --> 3360.10]  What?
[3360.32 --> 3363.56]  Steve Jobs would be rolling in his fucking grave.
[3363.64 --> 3364.42]  Oh, because the padding thing.
[3364.42 --> 3364.68]  Seeing this.
[3365.90 --> 3370.04]  Look, the Apple fucking logo is cut off.
[3371.12 --> 3372.46]  Oh, no way.
[3375.72 --> 3376.68]  Look at this.
[3378.78 --> 3380.26]  The top left here.
[3380.70 --> 3381.60]  It's not cut off.
[3381.70 --> 3382.34]  No, it's not.
[3383.72 --> 3384.20]  Sometimes.
[3385.40 --> 3385.88]  Sometimes.
[3386.90 --> 3388.12]  The logo gets cut off.
[3388.16 --> 3388.68]  Wait, really?
[3388.82 --> 3389.86]  Why does it move at all?
[3391.30 --> 3392.98]  What a great question, Luke.
[3393.04 --> 3394.56]  It's OLED safe, like the WAN banner.
[3394.60 --> 3396.12]  Yeah, why does over-scan exist?
[3396.38 --> 3397.16]  I don't know.
[3399.66 --> 3400.42]  I'm sorry.
[3400.42 --> 3402.42]  The logo that just goes off the screen.
[3402.48 --> 3403.54]  Isn't that wild, dude?
[3405.10 --> 3406.12]  Isn't that wild?
[3406.28 --> 3408.62]  You know, I would respect it if it was OLED safe.
[3409.16 --> 3411.44]  But the fact that it would go off the screen is insane.
[3411.86 --> 3412.10]  Yeah.
[3412.10 --> 3414.84]  And it's just the logo, not any of the other top bar text.
[3415.00 --> 3415.06]  Yeah.
[3415.32 --> 3419.16]  And you look how much padding it has on my built-in display.
[3419.16 --> 3419.86]  Yeah, it's a lot.
[3420.12 --> 3421.04]  Initially, I thought.
[3421.10 --> 3422.80]  I was like, oh, you know what it probably is?
[3422.80 --> 3426.24]  It's because Apple has their stupid rounded displays, and this is a square corner one.
[3426.24 --> 3427.32]  That's not it.
[3427.32 --> 3431.32]  Because I went and checked on Alex's system, because he's also doing the 30-day challenge,
[3431.32 --> 3432.36]  and his is fine.
[3433.46 --> 3434.82]  And he has never seen it.
[3436.04 --> 3437.84]  How do any of their products have bugs?
[3437.92 --> 3439.72]  They only have to make them for one device.
[3440.18 --> 3441.28]  It's, dude, it's...
[3441.28 --> 3442.30]  It just drives me nuts.
[3442.30 --> 3443.36]  It's wild.
[3444.28 --> 3445.80]  Disk management is terrible.
[3445.96 --> 3449.26]  I mean, disk management is kind of terrible on Windows as well, but I had a Linux-formatted
[3449.26 --> 3454.00]  USB drive, and I basically put it in, and it read all the files and everything, but I
[3454.00 --> 3455.16]  couldn't copy anything to it.
[3455.28 --> 3456.96]  I couldn't erase it.
[3456.96 --> 3458.38]  I couldn't reformat it.
[3458.86 --> 3465.82]  The flow was wrong, so when I couldn't do it, it sent me to a tool that didn't even bring
[3465.82 --> 3466.88]  me to the USB drive.
[3467.06 --> 3470.32]  It just took me to the, like, system settings for my boot drive.
[3470.94 --> 3472.36]  It's completely useless.
[3472.56 --> 3474.06]  Completely sent me in the wrong direction.
[3474.22 --> 3478.46]  It might as well have been, like, a fix-it wizard from Windows XP.
[3478.90 --> 3479.82]  Completely useless.
[3482.40 --> 3483.26]  Oh, man.
[3485.34 --> 3485.98]  Oh, man.
[3485.98 --> 3486.98]  I...
[3486.98 --> 3487.98]  Uh...
[3488.94 --> 3488.98]  Uh...
[3488.98 --> 3491.62]  Cypher Colt said, is it a pixel shift to protect the panel?
[3491.72 --> 3491.88]  No.
[3492.06 --> 3492.68]  Absolutely not.
[3492.68 --> 3493.72]  Dan and I were just talking about that.
[3493.92 --> 3494.96]  Oh, absolute joke.
[3495.08 --> 3495.44]  Yeah, no.
[3495.44 --> 3498.50]  Even if it was, you wouldn't have to make it go off the screen.
[3498.60 --> 3500.06]  Well, no, the panel would do it.
[3500.64 --> 3500.94]  So...
[3500.94 --> 3501.56]  Oh, I see.
[3501.56 --> 3502.74]  So Apple wouldn't be able to control that.
[3502.74 --> 3503.00]  I see, I see.
[3503.24 --> 3503.46]  I see, I see.
[3503.46 --> 3504.60]  That's definitely still not what's happening.
[3504.60 --> 3505.36]  It's only the logo.
[3505.36 --> 3506.26]  Based on the other thing...
[3506.26 --> 3506.68]  Yeah, exactly.
[3506.78 --> 3508.56]  Based on the other things that are on the screen, that's not what happened.
[3508.60 --> 3509.52]  I will double check.
[3509.82 --> 3515.74]  I will make sure before I actually, you know, crucify Apple for cutting off their own logo
[3515.98 --> 3516.74]  on their interface.
[3517.62 --> 3519.26]  Well, that doesn't fit the design language.
[3519.38 --> 3521.08]  And as you said, Steve would be rolling over.
[3521.50 --> 3526.24]  Steve would be livid if he saw the Apple logo get cut off.
[3527.38 --> 3527.70]  Livid.
[3528.76 --> 3531.32]  And that's not even, like, debatable.
[3531.98 --> 3534.54]  You literally cannot debate this.
[3535.72 --> 3536.20]  Imagine.
[3537.34 --> 3537.72]  Oh, yeah.
[3537.94 --> 3539.48]  There's no way.
[3539.48 --> 3544.30]  Like, people would potentially be fired over something that egregious.
[3544.44 --> 3545.26]  You do not...
[3545.26 --> 3545.44]  Screaming.
[3545.66 --> 3546.98]  You do not do that.
[3547.68 --> 3549.32]  Gray Sim says it's not only the logo.
[3549.40 --> 3550.34]  And I think you might be right.
[3550.60 --> 3554.22]  So I think it might be down to the weird display scaling issues that I'm having.
[3554.30 --> 3555.38]  So I will investigate.
[3556.06 --> 3559.64]  But it shouldn't happen with any kind of display scaling.
[3559.88 --> 3560.00]  Yep.
[3561.10 --> 3561.54]  Zoop.
[3562.42 --> 3564.80]  Yeah, I think there's less margin on top of Safari as well.
[3564.80 --> 3565.56]  Yeah, there definitely is.
[3565.56 --> 3567.88]  Either way, either way, I will look into it.
[3567.98 --> 3569.66]  But this is not a desired behavior.
[3569.92 --> 3572.46]  And I think that's too much to be OLED pixel shift.
[3572.56 --> 3573.58]  But I will check.
[3574.02 --> 3574.82]  I will check.
[3576.08 --> 3577.26]  But, oh, my God.
[3577.36 --> 3578.16]  They're definitely right.
[3578.24 --> 3580.94]  It's not just the acceleration on the mouse scroll wheel.
[3581.34 --> 3582.56]  That's the first thing I asked you.
[3582.80 --> 3584.56]  Is infuriating.
[3585.90 --> 3586.30]  Infuriating.
[3586.58 --> 3588.32]  If you do it because they use...
[3588.32 --> 3588.88]  I didn't even realize...
[3588.88 --> 3591.64]  They use momentum, like on a touch interface.
[3592.50 --> 3595.54]  And it's ironic, right, for computers that don't have...
[3595.56 --> 3596.84]  Touch screens!
[3598.42 --> 3599.54]  They have touchpads.
[3600.50 --> 3601.54]  Yeah, they have touchpads.
[3601.76 --> 3602.88]  So it uses...
[3604.54 --> 3604.84]  What?
[3604.96 --> 3605.46]  Start listening.
[3605.68 --> 3606.68]  Can you not close that?
[3606.70 --> 3607.64]  Yeah, this is amazing.
[3607.94 --> 3608.56]  Okay, welcome to Apple Music.
[3608.56 --> 3609.86]  I was just looking like, how do you close it?
[3609.86 --> 3612.06]  So they have, you know, window...
[3612.06 --> 3614.90]  They have, like, closed this thing, you know, interface.
[3615.56 --> 3616.24]  But...
[3616.24 --> 3617.92]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.
[3618.04 --> 3618.58]  You want to...
[3618.58 --> 3619.48]  Oh, oh, okay.
[3619.58 --> 3619.78]  No.
[3619.92 --> 3621.58]  Well, sometimes...
[3621.58 --> 3625.22]  Sometimes the red button just, like, goes away.
[3625.28 --> 3626.94]  And you need to use the top bar.
[3627.14 --> 3627.80]  Because...
[3627.80 --> 3632.16]  Like, I talked about this a lot in my iPhone challenge video.
[3632.16 --> 3636.82]  Where it's like, look, if you want to have your logic for doing things, fine.
[3638.14 --> 3638.54]  Fine.
[3639.76 --> 3641.10]  There needs to be consistency.
[3641.44 --> 3641.56]  Yeah.
[3641.56 --> 3646.28]  If you're going to have your little stoplights, and the red one closes this window, and you...
[3646.28 --> 3647.18]  You saw that.
[3647.34 --> 3650.04]  It literally had the stoplights.
[3650.24 --> 3651.62]  But the red one was grayed out.
[3651.64 --> 3652.26]  White out, the red one.
[3652.56 --> 3653.66]  F***ing why?
[3654.82 --> 3659.02]  If you know it's supposed to be there, you clearly know what I want to do.
[3659.84 --> 3661.10]  Let it close.
[3661.46 --> 3661.86]  No.
[3662.00 --> 3663.62]  But no, I have to go up to the top.
[3663.70 --> 3664.48]  You're not allowed.
[3665.00 --> 3665.70]  That's not...
[3665.70 --> 3666.44]  That's not okay.
[3666.58 --> 3666.90]  That's...
[3666.90 --> 3668.74]  That is just bad design.
[3668.84 --> 3670.36]  And again, it's not debatable.
[3670.66 --> 3672.22]  Is Command-Q, like, Alt-F4?
[3672.60 --> 3672.82]  Yeah.
[3674.82 --> 3675.98]  Inconsistent design.
[3676.28 --> 3678.78]  Is bad design.
[3680.96 --> 3681.48]  That's it.
[3682.04 --> 3686.26]  Someone in chat saying, Command-Q everything, or else it doesn't fully close the application.
[3686.68 --> 3687.98]  Dan, do you want to get rid of the screenshot?
[3688.06 --> 3688.56]  Oh, sorry.
[3688.62 --> 3688.88]  I forgot.
[3689.32 --> 3693.30]  I thought Command-Q was more like Control-W, and then there's, like, Command-something-Q,
[3693.40 --> 3694.48]  which is more like Alt-F4.
[3695.26 --> 3695.66]  I don't know.
[3695.72 --> 3696.70]  I haven't had to use it yet.
[3696.80 --> 3697.48]  It's been a long while.
[3697.78 --> 3698.14]  Unsure.
[3699.52 --> 3699.94]  Let's see.
[3700.00 --> 3700.58]  What else we got?
[3700.64 --> 3701.00]  Oh, man.
[3701.04 --> 3702.06]  The acceleration on the scroll wheel.
[3702.08 --> 3703.08]  I haven't looked into that one yet.
[3703.08 --> 3705.24]  Hopefully there's a fix for that, but it is infuriating.
[3705.24 --> 3707.02]  Oh, it's more like Control-Q on Linux.
[3707.12 --> 3707.30]  Okay.
[3707.44 --> 3708.60]  I mean, that makes sense.
[3708.76 --> 3710.24]  Oh, Command-W.
[3710.44 --> 3712.48]  So that's, like, Control-W on Windows.
[3713.30 --> 3720.14]  Capturing screenshots was pure pain the first time I did it, because basically, this actually,
[3720.20 --> 3721.12]  like, still makes me mad.
[3721.42 --> 3727.72]  I asked Alex, which was my first mistake, and he goes, oh, it's Command-Shift-5, I think,
[3727.74 --> 3728.44]  or something like that.
[3728.48 --> 3728.88]  No, no, no.
[3729.00 --> 3730.30]  He told me three, I think.
[3730.66 --> 3732.34]  It's Command-Shift-3 to get a screen.
[3732.34 --> 3732.90]  Yeah, there you go.
[3733.14 --> 3737.86]  So it pulls up the screenshot here, and then I was looking at this interface, and there's,
[3737.86 --> 3740.72]  like, no obvious way to save this, right?
[3740.80 --> 3743.04]  So there's, like, Share, which is not really what I want to do.
[3743.18 --> 3747.52]  Delete, Markup, whatever this means, and Close.
[3747.76 --> 3752.20]  So there was no, like, obvious way to save it, and I was like, okay, so, like, is it saved
[3752.20 --> 3752.56]  already?
[3752.66 --> 3753.52]  Is it saved automatically?
[3753.68 --> 3755.78]  Wait, but they don't have the traffic lights for Close?
[3755.84 --> 3756.70]  It's just, like, an X?
[3756.84 --> 3757.02]  Yeah.
[3757.22 --> 3757.96]  Don't worry about it.
[3757.96 --> 3759.90]  It's really, really good UI design.
[3760.00 --> 3760.38]  That's weird.
[3761.02 --> 3762.40]  I didn't even notice that part.
[3762.76 --> 3763.76]  That's good, though.
[3763.84 --> 3764.12]  Yeah.
[3764.72 --> 3766.96]  Anyway, I was like, okay, well, like, did it save somewhere?
[3767.08 --> 3768.64]  Here, I'll just open Finder, and I'll find out.
[3769.18 --> 3770.70]  But my Finder wasn't like that.
[3770.72 --> 3771.34]  It was like this.
[3771.98 --> 3773.18]  So I opened Finder.
[3773.44 --> 3774.72]  Wait, what?
[3774.90 --> 3776.26]  Is it behind the screen?
[3776.30 --> 3778.04]  And then I was like, okay, well, did it open?
[3778.28 --> 3779.34]  Here, new Finder window.
[3780.22 --> 3781.50]  But it didn't do it like that.
[3781.50 --> 3783.10]  It did it, like, behind it again.
[3783.90 --> 3785.50]  So I was like, what?
[3787.56 --> 3788.86]  But I can move this.
[3788.98 --> 3789.36]  Hold on.
[3789.98 --> 3791.18]  If I click on it twice.
[3791.34 --> 3794.02]  First, you have to click on a window to make it the focus window.
[3794.58 --> 3794.94]  Oh.
[3795.20 --> 3797.44]  Then you have to click again in order to move it.
[3797.78 --> 3800.40]  And then I was like, okay, Finder's, sorry, it's behind this.
[3802.16 --> 3805.12]  And then, oh, man, I ran into a really funny one.
[3805.58 --> 3808.12]  So I was able to, oh, I forget.
[3808.56 --> 3810.46]  I was able, did I, I think, did I screen record this?
[3810.46 --> 3818.00]  I was able to edit the text in this window unless I had this one as the focus.
[3818.12 --> 3818.54]  I forget.
[3818.88 --> 3824.32]  But basically, I could interact with a window behind it, except when I couldn't.
[3825.62 --> 3830.92]  And so it's just, and what's funny is that this one, this screenshot preview, it's like an app.
[3831.14 --> 3834.68]  Like, you can mark up a screenshot, and you can share, and you can do this stuff.
[3834.88 --> 3839.78]  But it also isn't an app, because if you look up at the top bar, it's still Safari up here.
[3839.78 --> 3844.56]  So I cannot quit this app by going up here.
[3844.62 --> 3848.78]  Yeah, people are saying that's what Apple calls a preview window that stays on top of other windows.
[3849.28 --> 3850.22]  Couldn't tell you why they do that.
[3850.30 --> 3852.08]  I mean, yeah, that's a feature in Windows as well.
[3852.14 --> 3854.56]  They just don't use it very often, because it's incredibly annoying.
[3855.50 --> 3855.82]  Yeah.
[3856.58 --> 3859.44]  It's really, really, it's a really bad experience.
[3859.58 --> 3861.32]  Well, what it is, is it's an inconsistent experience.
[3861.32 --> 3865.40]  I know a lot of people, other people are saying that you don't have to click twice.
[3865.54 --> 3867.78]  But I mean, I've seen him do it like a million times.
[3867.78 --> 3870.60]  And when he tries to select it the first time, literally nothing happens.
[3870.60 --> 3871.30]  So I'm not sure.
[3871.64 --> 3873.12]  Maybe that's a configurable thing.
[3873.46 --> 3876.32]  Maybe it's depending on where you click.
[3876.32 --> 3876.50]  Where you click.
[3876.66 --> 3879.36]  Because I'll usually go for the bar, and I'll want to move something.
[3879.62 --> 3879.82]  Right.
[3879.86 --> 3883.54]  And it looks like I have to make it the focus, and then click again.
[3883.94 --> 3884.32]  It doesn't...
[3885.46 --> 3887.94]  Yeah, Bonkies is saying I haven't clicked twice in ever.
[3887.94 --> 3891.16]  I mean, you guys just watched me do it, so...
[3891.16 --> 3894.88]  And I have watched, to be clear, obviously he is clicking twice.
[3894.94 --> 3895.88]  We've seen him click twice.
[3895.88 --> 3898.16]  But I've seen him try to click once, and it doesn't do anything.
[3898.82 --> 3900.12]  So, yeah.
[3900.88 --> 3901.28]  So...
[3901.28 --> 3902.12]  No, it's a pebcac error.
[3902.22 --> 3903.04]  But you guys...
[3903.04 --> 3903.90]  Sorry, we need...
[3903.90 --> 3904.32]  Why?
[3904.70 --> 3907.18]  You guys literally watched me try to drag it there.
[3907.32 --> 3909.12]  Like, I did try to do it, and it didn't work.
[3909.18 --> 3910.86]  And I had to go back and get it and move it, so...
[3910.86 --> 3912.74]  Maybe it's clicking on the name of the window?
[3914.38 --> 3914.70]  Maybe.
[3914.82 --> 3916.68]  So you can't click just anywhere on the bar?
[3916.74 --> 3917.82]  You have to click right on the name?
[3917.82 --> 3919.16]  Maybe there's a particular spot.
[3919.32 --> 3920.44]  This is one that...
[3920.44 --> 3924.14]  This is one that, like, needs more investigation, but I've definitely run into it.
[3924.16 --> 3924.36]  Okay.
[3924.64 --> 3925.30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3926.42 --> 3930.34]  Apparently, Command-Shift-4 is like snipping tool...
[3930.34 --> 3930.48]  Yes.
[3930.48 --> 3931.50]  ...where you can select a portion of the...
[3931.50 --> 3935.20]  Well, that's why I said part of my problem was I listened to Alex, who's a new Mac user.
[3935.34 --> 3936.06]  So he said 5.
[3936.10 --> 3936.96]  Command-Shift...
[3936.96 --> 3937.94]  No, he said 3.
[3938.20 --> 3938.36]  Oh.
[3938.36 --> 3941.54]  So Command-Shift-5 is also pretty good.
[3941.62 --> 3944.68]  That brings up, like, screen capture, which is built into macOS.
[3944.80 --> 3945.22]  That's cool.
[3945.22 --> 3945.26]  No.
[3945.78 --> 3951.96]  How is it even possible that screen capture is not built into Windows yet?
[3951.96 --> 3952.10]  Yeah.
[3952.32 --> 3953.88]  Yeah, no, that's genuinely cool.
[3954.02 --> 3956.88]  How is that even possible?
[3957.04 --> 3959.06]  Every Windows user is just OBS built.
[3959.88 --> 3961.18]  Like, unbelievable.
[3961.36 --> 3962.42]  They should not have to be.
[3962.46 --> 3964.58]  It's like one of the first apps I installed on my computer now.
[3964.58 --> 3972.94]  OBS's interface is so obtuse compared to, you know, something slick and built-in.
[3972.94 --> 3974.68]  No, that genuinely, like, looks really nice.
[3974.82 --> 3975.02]  Yeah.
[3975.28 --> 3975.92]  That's cool.
[3976.30 --> 3977.22]  Like, it's unreal.
[3977.48 --> 3977.80]  I like it.
[3978.28 --> 3981.20]  Urban Fervor says, I think it's built into Windows 11 now.
[3981.58 --> 3983.52]  I'm going to have to check.
[3983.74 --> 3985.98]  I have not seen an obvious place for it.
[3986.04 --> 3987.32]  Someone says Windows G.
[3987.96 --> 3989.16]  Isn't that the game bar?
[3990.24 --> 3990.70]  Hold on.
[3990.70 --> 3993.52]  Yes, it's built into the game bar.
[3994.32 --> 3995.08]  Oh, my God.
[3995.16 --> 3996.12]  I hate the game bar.
[3996.28 --> 4000.22]  Literally, the game bar is so horrible that I would never want to use it.
[4000.28 --> 4001.86]  It's also Windows Alt R.
[4001.86 --> 4002.98]  Windows Alt R, yeah.
[4003.20 --> 4005.06]  Windows Alt R.
[4005.06 --> 4010.16]  I use Windows Shift S all the time for taking screenshots, too.
[4010.26 --> 4010.96]  I think it's working.
[4011.06 --> 4012.68]  Well, where's the interface for this?
[4012.78 --> 4013.64]  I don't see it at all.
[4013.74 --> 4014.08]  How do I?
[4014.50 --> 4015.20]  Top right for me.
[4015.20 --> 4015.54]  Oh, my God.
[4015.58 --> 4016.14]  You have to hop.
[4016.22 --> 4016.66]  Wait, no.
[4017.48 --> 4018.14]  How do I?
[4018.32 --> 4020.66]  If you hit Windows R again.
[4020.82 --> 4023.96]  How the hell do I, like, interact with this thing?
[4024.06 --> 4024.58]  You don't.
[4025.10 --> 4025.98]  Well, that's stupid.
[4027.10 --> 4029.00]  Just stop the recording with the same shortcut.
[4029.00 --> 4031.12]  I click the stop recording button, and it's just gone.
[4031.20 --> 4032.22]  I'm assuming it's in videos now.
[4032.22 --> 4033.82]  Sorry, was it Windows Alt R?
[4033.82 --> 4035.76]  I think that's the recording one.
[4036.04 --> 4036.64]  Windows Shift R.
[4036.96 --> 4038.02]  No, Windows Alt R.
[4038.62 --> 4040.96]  Yeah, Windows Alt R, and then it just, like, goes.
[4041.08 --> 4042.78]  How the hell do you configure it?
[4044.60 --> 4045.04]  Recording.
[4046.10 --> 4047.38]  So, mine worked.
[4047.68 --> 4047.88]  Yeah.
[4048.26 --> 4051.36]  Just when you click stop, it just goes to your videos folder under captures.
[4051.84 --> 4054.72]  Man, is Windows search ever useless.
[4054.86 --> 4056.56]  That feels a little clunky.
[4057.04 --> 4060.66]  Searching for recording yields record audio when I record a game.
[4060.66 --> 4062.44]  You capture mouse cursor in game.
[4062.44 --> 4063.94]  Game captures maximum recording length.
[4064.02 --> 4065.82]  Fixing problems with the game bar.
[4065.96 --> 4069.44]  Okay, game bar settings, I think, is maybe what I was looking for.
[4070.18 --> 4071.28]  Help with game bar.
[4071.52 --> 4072.28]  Looks like no.
[4072.36 --> 4073.18]  Oh, my God.
[4073.26 --> 4074.72]  Why is this so hard to find?
[4075.74 --> 4076.18]  Stop.
[4076.54 --> 4077.60]  I love computers.
[4077.60 --> 4078.22]  Windows G.
[4078.66 --> 4080.86]  Okay, so, like, can I configure it here?
[4080.98 --> 4081.32]  Settings.
[4082.46 --> 4084.20]  Oh, don't do that.
[4085.36 --> 4085.76]  Settings.
[4086.38 --> 4086.72]  Hello?
[4086.72 --> 4086.82]  Hello?
[4086.82 --> 4089.76]  Capture settings, maybe?
[4090.66 --> 4091.92]  Oh, was that the settings?
[4092.08 --> 4094.30]  Did I make the settings go away?
[4094.92 --> 4095.30]  Did I click?
[4095.38 --> 4095.56]  No.
[4095.82 --> 4098.54]  I think settings is what you recorded last time, actually.
[4098.74 --> 4099.06]  Settings.
[4100.32 --> 4100.68]  Seriously.
[4100.92 --> 4101.22]  Oh, no.
[4101.28 --> 4102.20]  That's what it will record.
[4102.26 --> 4103.76]  Yeah, no, I'm trying to click this, and I can't.
[4103.82 --> 4104.32]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4104.46 --> 4106.92]  That is not a settings button.
[4107.16 --> 4107.32]  Yeah.
[4107.36 --> 4110.50]  It's because the window below you, what you're going to record is settings.
[4110.50 --> 4113.52]  Like, mine says the perpetual WAN show livestream document.
[4113.80 --> 4114.60]  Oh, hilarious.
[4114.80 --> 4115.10]  That.
[4115.26 --> 4115.70]  Wow.
[4115.90 --> 4116.50]  Oh, wow.
[4116.64 --> 4116.86]  Okay.
[4117.34 --> 4119.66]  Yeah, you just, yeah.
[4120.32 --> 4121.22]  Gaining features?
[4121.90 --> 4123.06]  This is horrible.
[4123.24 --> 4125.16]  Why is this so hard to just configure?
[4125.68 --> 4127.22]  Someone said it's built into Snipping Tool.
[4127.30 --> 4129.12]  Oh, settings in the bar at the top.
[4129.18 --> 4130.10]  Top right-hand corner of the bar.
[4130.14 --> 4130.42]  Yeah, I know.
[4130.46 --> 4130.84]  I found it.
[4130.90 --> 4133.16]  That's it right here, but it's not in there.
[4133.56 --> 4137.38]  Like, there's no configuration for screen recording.
[4137.38 --> 4140.74]  How is this so stupid?
[4142.66 --> 4143.06]  Man.
[4143.40 --> 4143.90]  Oh, no.
[4144.08 --> 4146.04]  It's like people don't use these products, you know?
[4147.36 --> 4148.70]  Okay, so, uh.
[4148.82 --> 4150.54]  Windows Shift R is the better one.
[4150.88 --> 4151.82]  Isn't that what we just did?
[4151.92 --> 4152.50]  Snipping Tool.
[4152.64 --> 4153.34]  Oh, yeah, no, no.
[4153.34 --> 4154.10]  Snipping Tool can do.
[4154.10 --> 4155.32]  Oh, but Snipping Tool is record.
[4155.56 --> 4155.60]  Okay.
[4156.02 --> 4156.38]  Settings.
[4156.54 --> 4158.58]  Yeah, I haven't played around with Snipping Tool much lately.
[4159.70 --> 4161.76]  Been a ShareX guy for a while.
[4162.10 --> 4162.92]  Here we go.
[4163.26 --> 4163.62]  Okay.
[4164.24 --> 4165.58]  HDR color corrector.
[4165.58 --> 4167.12]  Okay, this has some stuff in it.
[4167.76 --> 4171.90]  Where the devil do I, like, change any encoding settings or anything?
[4173.92 --> 4175.60]  I think that's a no.
[4176.90 --> 4177.34]  Okay.
[4179.20 --> 4180.00]  Uh, yeah.
[4180.22 --> 4182.46]  This could be better on Windows as well.
[4182.46 --> 4187.90]  Like, again, I've said this a lot of times, and for some reason it doesn't work, but I'm
[4187.90 --> 4189.62]  going to say it again just for fun.
[4190.48 --> 4196.66]  Just because I have a bunch of gripes about macOS does not mean, in fact, that I hate hot
[4196.66 --> 4196.94]  dogs.
[4197.38 --> 4199.16]  Or actually, no, it doesn't mean I like hot dogs.
[4199.38 --> 4200.48]  I might hate everything.
[4201.06 --> 4202.26]  Everything might be terrible.
[4202.94 --> 4203.86]  Everything is awful.
[4203.86 --> 4211.10]  Um, so yeah, this is something that is, could obviously be better on the Windows side of
[4211.10 --> 4211.40]  things.
[4211.40 --> 4214.40]  All right.
[4214.40 --> 4214.74]  What else?
[4214.74 --> 4214.96]  What else?
[4214.96 --> 4215.78]  What else we got here?
[4216.58 --> 4217.54]  Oh, dude.
[4217.68 --> 4228.08]  The fact that the Mac App Store and the Safari extension store are jumbled together is mind-blowing
[4228.08 --> 4228.54]  to me.
[4228.62 --> 4229.18]  That sounds horrible.
[4229.18 --> 4231.60]  I searched for Keeper in the App Store.
[4231.60 --> 4235.22]  And it came up with a Safari extension and a desktop application.
[4235.22 --> 4239.54]  Are you kidding me?
[4240.00 --> 4240.64]  Is that that bad?
[4241.10 --> 4241.40]  Yeah.
[4241.50 --> 4242.58]  That's really stupid.
[4242.92 --> 4243.30]  Why is it that bad?
[4243.30 --> 4244.98]  Especially because it wasn't obvious.
[4245.36 --> 4245.78]  Ah, okay.
[4245.96 --> 4247.60]  I was going to say, is it clearly delineated?
[4247.60 --> 4251.32]  Like, one of them was obviously for Safari and the other one was just like Keeper.
[4252.08 --> 4252.80]  I was like, okay.
[4253.10 --> 4255.16]  So I've got Keeper and Keeper for Safari.
[4255.28 --> 4256.94]  What does that even, what does that even mean?
[4257.10 --> 4259.24]  Solve that with just like a pretty simple tagging system.
[4259.54 --> 4260.22]  Uh, yeah.
[4260.38 --> 4261.32]  Seems easy to solve.
[4261.66 --> 4262.50]  Yeah, definitely.
[4262.66 --> 4263.78]  Not that they've done it, but.
[4264.08 --> 4266.56]  Yeah, it seems very, very solvable.
[4266.82 --> 4267.00]  Yeah.
[4267.32 --> 4268.94]  Um, oh man.
[4269.06 --> 4271.92]  Volume adjustment doesn't work on my external display.
[4272.12 --> 4278.12]  Definitely need a little bit more, uh, diagnosis there, but literally doesn't work with my scroll
[4278.12 --> 4279.12]  wheel on my keyboard.
[4279.54 --> 4282.72]  Doesn't work with the, uh, with the volume adjuster in the corner.
[4282.86 --> 4284.40]  Like it's there, but it's just grayed out.
[4284.40 --> 4288.22]  It's kind of like when you connect to a Bluetooth speaker and it just kind of maxes it out,
[4288.28 --> 4292.66]  assuming that you'll do volume control on the external device, except that configuring
[4292.66 --> 4297.90]  volume level on the like nipple on the bottom of my monitor is not very convenient for me
[4297.90 --> 4299.72]  because I use my monitors built in speakers.
[4300.54 --> 4301.42]  Very annoying.
[4301.84 --> 4306.74]  Uh, some other people in chat are saying, um, uh, they have some issues with that as well.
[4306.98 --> 4309.72]  Apparently I need display buddy to fix some of my issues.
[4309.72 --> 4311.38]  I'm going to write down display buddy here.
[4311.38 --> 4313.60]  Why do you have to install so many programs?
[4313.60 --> 4314.44]  Right.
[4314.54 --> 4317.02]  It's like, doesn't it just work?
[4317.42 --> 4318.78]  I thought it just works, right?
[4319.18 --> 4320.38]  Doesn't it just work Dan?
[4320.52 --> 4321.24]  Isn't that Todd Howard?
[4321.78 --> 4322.40]  Oh my God.
[4322.50 --> 4325.86]  Paste as plain text is not a right click context menu option.
[4326.02 --> 4327.04]  You have to press.
[4327.32 --> 4331.06]  And I kid you not command alt shift V.
[4331.26 --> 4331.46]  What?
[4331.92 --> 4332.22]  No.
[4332.42 --> 4334.80]  It's also apparently not supported everywhere.
[4334.80 --> 4338.14]  So there's a horrible terminal workaround that I found on Reddit.
[4340.02 --> 4344.54]  So when in full plane chat, uh, I lost their message, but they mentioned that like this
[4344.54 --> 4348.16]  segment was painful because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4348.16 --> 4349.84]  And no Mac users use Safari.
[4350.46 --> 4352.22]  Um, what are you even talking about?
[4352.22 --> 4355.64]  In 2023 Safari was the second most used web browser.
[4356.14 --> 4361.52]  Um, and the amount of people that have Macs versus other types of PCs is like way lower.
[4361.72 --> 4366.14]  So as far as my understanding goes and actually huge percentage of Mac users use Safari.
[4366.32 --> 4375.26]  It's really, really, really interesting to hear people say no one, this thing that I don't do.
[4375.26 --> 4375.90]  Yeah.
[4376.06 --> 4381.66]  I guarantee you that if no one was using Safari on the desktop, it's very mobile.
[4381.78 --> 4382.46]  Interesting point.
[4383.34 --> 4383.86]  Absolutely.
[4384.22 --> 4384.38]  Yeah.
[4384.40 --> 4387.86]  Safari mobile is definitely a thing, but people definitely use Safari.
[4387.98 --> 4389.34]  Don't kid yourself.
[4389.94 --> 4395.68]  People just many people just use whatever the included apps are on their computer or phone
[4395.68 --> 4396.34]  or whatever.
[4396.50 --> 4401.34]  Like, why do you think internet Explorer, in spite of being such a steaming pile of garbage
[4401.34 --> 4405.24]  for so many years, held onto its market share deal has like 10%.
[4405.24 --> 4408.14]  Because people just use whatever's in front of them.
[4408.86 --> 4410.78]  Do not kid yourself.
[4411.06 --> 4412.38]  People use Safari.
[4413.52 --> 4415.36]  Um, all right.
[4415.38 --> 4416.20]  What else we got here?
[4416.36 --> 4417.64]  No, it's desktop users.
[4417.82 --> 4420.76]  Apparently almost 12% of desktop user market share is Safari.
[4421.96 --> 4422.44]  Yeah.
[4422.48 --> 4427.58]  That's like, that's such a, that's such a non take that people don't use it.
[4428.40 --> 4435.12]  Um, oh man, middle click press to get like a scroll thing to when you move your mouse
[4435.12 --> 4437.28]  and scroll, not a thing.
[4438.70 --> 4439.58]  Such a downer.
[4439.72 --> 4440.22]  That's annoying.
[4440.32 --> 4440.84]  I use that a lot.
[4440.94 --> 4442.92]  I use that all the time.
[4443.00 --> 4446.20]  So a lot of very conflicting stats on browser market share.
[4446.30 --> 4446.70]  I don't know.
[4446.78 --> 4450.00]  I don't know which one of these is right, but the scale uses it.
[4450.08 --> 4451.12]  That's all you need to know.
[4451.18 --> 4451.34]  Yeah.
[4451.34 --> 4453.04]  Someone definitely uses it.
[4453.68 --> 4455.72]  Um, yeah.
[4455.80 --> 4459.82]  So, I mean, there's, I'm going to find all kinds of things I like maybe eventually.
[4459.82 --> 4461.42]  I haven't really found any yet.
[4461.88 --> 4465.28]  Um, but I'm sure something, I'm going to like something about it.
[4465.30 --> 4466.50]  I definitely like the hardware.
[4467.30 --> 4470.50]  Like the Mac book itself is great.
[4470.74 --> 4471.90]  Always has been really.
[4472.04 --> 4476.92]  Um, to be honest, PC laptops have been struggling.
[4476.92 --> 4477.64]  Yeah.
[4478.00 --> 4479.04]  Forever, basically.
[4479.56 --> 4480.02]  Compared to Mac.
[4480.02 --> 4483.16]  HP's got a really cool one that uses the same, um.
[4483.36 --> 4486.14]  Those fingerprints on that screen are like actually bothering me.
[4486.24 --> 4486.86]  Yeah, I know, right?
[4487.66 --> 4488.52]  It's not even a touchscreen.
[4488.68 --> 4489.18]  Why are they there?
[4489.26 --> 4489.58]  Oh.
[4489.82 --> 4490.34]  Watch this.
[4490.76 --> 4491.14]  Oh.
[4492.98 --> 4493.92]  I'll clean it after.
[4494.46 --> 4494.78]  Um.
[4494.92 --> 4496.64]  Steve is rolling in his grave because of that.
[4496.88 --> 4497.46]  Yeah, I know, right?
[4498.80 --> 4500.28]  Maybe that's why they're not touchscreens.
[4500.28 --> 4500.68]  Oh, yeah.
[4500.76 --> 4506.24]  HP has a super cool machine that uses the same processor as the new framework desktop.
[4507.24 --> 4508.52]  Strix Halo from AMD.
[4508.80 --> 4511.52]  That thing looks sick in a framework investment disclosure.
[4511.72 --> 4514.68]  But man, that HP machine looks amazing.
[4514.80 --> 4517.38]  It's one of only three devices I've seen so far with Strix Halo.
[4517.64 --> 4520.58]  And as far as I can tell, I just love Strix Halo.
[4520.90 --> 4523.20]  And everything should just have Strix Halo now.
[4523.82 --> 4525.82]  As long as you don't mind the price.
[4525.94 --> 4529.02]  It's very, very expensive.
[4530.02 --> 4532.90]  It's, I don't know, actually.
[4532.90 --> 4536.84]  I saw it at CES, but that doesn't mean that it's out.
[4537.46 --> 4537.64]  Yeah.
[4538.38 --> 4538.78]  Uh.
[4538.98 --> 4539.76]  But, but, but, but, but.
[4539.80 --> 4541.78]  No, reviews just dropped, like, earlier.
[4542.32 --> 4542.66]  Strix.
[4542.80 --> 4543.46]  Z2.
[4544.08 --> 4544.60]  ZBook.
[4545.00 --> 4545.44]  ZBook.
[4545.54 --> 4545.98]  Strix Halo.
[4546.60 --> 4546.98]  Uh.
[4547.16 --> 4549.64]  I'm not, I'm not seeing anywhere to buy it yet.
[4551.44 --> 4554.00]  Does anyone know if you can actually, like, buy this thing yet?
[4554.12 --> 4554.76]  What is it called again?
[4555.86 --> 4556.30]  Uh.
[4556.56 --> 4557.04]  Let me see.
[4557.04 --> 4560.66]  ZBook Ultra 14 GI?
[4562.22 --> 4562.52]  Ugh.
[4563.12 --> 4563.72]  What a name.
[4564.00 --> 4565.02]  I know, right?
[4566.90 --> 4568.14]  ZBook Ultra 14.
[4568.34 --> 4568.68]  Here it is.
[4568.76 --> 4570.06]  Mobile workstation PC.
[4570.76 --> 4571.50]  Coming soon.
[4571.90 --> 4572.58]  Yeah, not yet.
[4572.60 --> 4575.28]  But this thing looks freaking awesome.
[4575.96 --> 4578.58]  Like it's, it's, what is this?
[4578.58 --> 4580.94]  I scrolled and it opened a freaking video?
[4581.10 --> 4581.24]  No.
[4581.34 --> 4582.54]  Oh, I must have accidentally clicked.
[4582.74 --> 4583.02]  Yeah.
[4583.02 --> 4583.38]  Yeah.
[4583.62 --> 4586.68]  50 NPU tops Ryzen AI Max.
[4586.92 --> 4589.52]  Up to 4 terabytes of storage.
[4589.84 --> 4591.78]  Oh, 128 gigs unified memory.
[4591.88 --> 4592.36]  Let's go.
[4593.10 --> 4594.30]  Dude, this thing looks incredible.
[4594.52 --> 4595.38]  It's super thin.
[4596.06 --> 4597.36]  The battery life is actually decent.
[4597.60 --> 4600.52]  And according to Alex, the performance is still pretty okay.
[4600.90 --> 4606.66]  Looking comparatively to the USB ports, it looks like they didn't 100% prioritize thinness,
[4606.66 --> 4607.76]  which I'm actually kind of down with.
[4608.14 --> 4608.96]  It doesn't look thick.
[4609.40 --> 4610.26]  Well, they need it.
[4610.34 --> 4612.34]  I mean, this thing will do up to 120 watts.
[4612.34 --> 4612.60]  Yeah.
[4612.60 --> 4613.02]  Strix Halo.
[4613.18 --> 4615.20]  So I think, I think they landed.
[4615.70 --> 4616.58]  Oh, don't quote me on this.
[4616.64 --> 4619.30]  I think they landed around 75 for this chassis.
[4619.60 --> 4621.10]  Apparently Tom's hardware says $2,700.
[4622.56 --> 4624.94]  It's not, it's not going to be cheap.
[4625.20 --> 4629.70]  I mean, that's the thing is I've seen a lot of criticism toward framework investment disclosure
[4629.70 --> 4634.12]  for their, their pricing, just about the desktop in general.
[4634.78 --> 4636.84]  And I've seen people dunking on them for the pricing.
[4636.84 --> 4642.42]  But I think the thing that people are missing here is that this LPDDR5 that they're using
[4642.42 --> 4644.54]  in, in this configuration with Strix Halo.
[4644.68 --> 4646.52]  Is it LPDDR5 or LPDDR5X?
[4646.56 --> 4647.12]  I can't remember.
[4647.22 --> 4651.04]  It's funny because you have to say that to like show potential bias or whatever.
[4651.20 --> 4655.70]  But you having to say that is probably like the most valuable thing to framework.
[4656.22 --> 4657.42]  You haven't watched the video, have you?
[4657.98 --> 4659.34]  Nirav says that point blank.
[4659.42 --> 4660.42]  It's like, oh, that's great.
[4660.42 --> 4662.20]  The more disclosures, the better.
[4662.56 --> 4666.06]  It's honestly like, it's just the consistency of it is insane.
[4666.64 --> 4672.88]  If any, if any other laptop gets any talking point ever framework also gets a talking point.
[4672.94 --> 4674.90]  It's like, holy crap.
[4675.92 --> 4676.26]  Yeah.
[4676.42 --> 4681.56]  I, now that they make a desktop, I think we legitimately have to kind of talk about how
[4681.56 --> 4686.82]  to deal with this because I can't do a framework disclosure every single time I talk about a
[4686.82 --> 4688.70]  laptop or a desktop computer.
[4688.70 --> 4694.66]  Can we, why don't we save that for, for the actual like framework announcement section
[4694.66 --> 4695.62]  of the WAN show though?
[4695.70 --> 4695.82]  That's painful.
[4695.94 --> 4696.72]  I never thought about that.
[4696.72 --> 4700.84]  Anyway, the point is people are giving framework a hard time about the desktop, but they're
[4700.84 --> 4705.60]  actually being extremely fair about their pricing for the upgrades and their pricing in general.
[4705.60 --> 4707.40]  Like this laptop we're looking at, what'd you say?
[4707.50 --> 4708.34]  Starts at $2,800?
[4709.16 --> 4710.16]  $2,700, I think.
[4710.24 --> 4710.70]  Somewhere around there.
[4710.84 --> 4711.00]  Yeah.
[4711.04 --> 4714.40]  The framework desktop, um, actually, let's see.
[4714.44 --> 4715.26]  Is their site up?
[4716.02 --> 4716.84]  Is it frame.work?
[4717.40 --> 4717.76]  Yeah.
[4718.54 --> 4718.58]  Yeah.
[4719.12 --> 4720.70]  Uh, desktop.
[4720.88 --> 4721.22]  Here we go.
[4723.06 --> 4723.78]  Pre-order now.
[4726.08 --> 4726.48]  Yeah.
[4726.48 --> 4727.66]  This thing starts at like $1,600.
[4728.66 --> 4730.36]  And yes, it doesn't have a display.
[4730.50 --> 4736.44]  And yes, you have to add your own storage and OS, but like it's still pretty good.
[4736.92 --> 4738.56]  Um, all things considered.
[4738.82 --> 4739.08]  Yeah.
[4739.08 --> 4740.08]  Okay.
[4740.08 --> 4740.44]  Yeah.
[4740.44 --> 4741.04]  Okay.
[4741.04 --> 4742.62]  What are we supposed to do, Mr. Dan?
[4743.70 --> 4746.00]  Let's explain merch messages and do some announcements.
[4746.34 --> 4746.96]  Merch messages.
[4747.42 --> 4751.22]  Today is a very special day to send a merch message.
[4751.22 --> 4751.76]  Please.
[4751.76 --> 4752.26]  It is.
[4752.26 --> 4752.30]  It is.
[4752.68 --> 4761.68]  We got some respite, um, in terms of tariffs from our, um, friends down in the States.
[4761.68 --> 4771.92]  And we are making the absolute most of that by moving up our schedule for our annual tax write-off sale event.
[4771.92 --> 4773.94]  Have you ever wanted to bother Dan?
[4773.94 --> 4774.94]  That's right.
[4774.94 --> 4774.98]  Ah!
[4774.98 --> 4775.48]  Ah!
[4775.48 --> 4776.22]  That's right, friends.
[4776.54 --> 4781.50]  You can save on, you can save on our inventory over stock.
[4781.50 --> 4781.84]  I'm sorry.
[4781.92 --> 4783.30]  This isn't the Lime Day sale.
[4783.40 --> 4785.26]  This isn't the Linus inventory management experience.
[4785.26 --> 4786.42]  This is the tax write-off sale.
[4786.92 --> 4792.92]  You can save on our tax write-offs on, well, inventory that we have that we need to get rid of.
[4793.12 --> 4800.60]  And you can avoid any future price increases due to future tariffs potentially asterisk.
[4800.90 --> 4805.06]  We have no idea what's going to happen because everything is topsy-turvy and unpredictable these days.
[4805.58 --> 4811.26]  Um, and if our costs do go up substantially, some items could be price-adjusted in the future.
[4811.26 --> 4815.36]  But what they definitely are not is price-adjusted today.
[4815.36 --> 4821.60]  If you place an order today, you will receive that order at the price that you paid for it.
[4821.60 --> 4829.80]  And to celebrate the tax write-off sale, we are tax writing off some shipping costs.
[4829.94 --> 4830.84]  That's right, my friends.
[4831.00 --> 4837.24]  If your order exceeds 175 US dollars, you will get free shipping to Timbuktu.
[4838.56 --> 4840.30]  Or anywhere, really.
[4840.50 --> 4840.68]  Yeah.
[4840.68 --> 4842.94]  Yeah, you don't have to be in Timbuktu.
[4843.10 --> 4843.88]  There's lots of places.
[4844.10 --> 4846.42]  It took me a long time to realize that that was an actual real place.
[4846.58 --> 4847.04]  I know, right?
[4847.04 --> 4847.42]  I just made up.
[4847.50 --> 4849.80]  I had a bit of a cry on the floor.
[4850.08 --> 4850.84]  Oh, wow.
[4850.96 --> 4852.24]  Yeah, no, Timbuktu, real place.
[4853.06 --> 4853.92]  Hey, put on your shirt.
[4854.40 --> 4855.06]  Now, oh, yes.
[4856.64 --> 4857.50]  I got you already.
[4857.50 --> 4865.04]  So now is as good a time as any to place an order on LTTstore.com.
[4865.10 --> 4867.30]  And if you're going to do it, why don't you send a merch message?
[4867.76 --> 4870.40]  Merch messages are the way to interact with the show.
[4870.48 --> 4871.20]  We don't do Twitch bits.
[4871.26 --> 4872.06]  We don't do Super Chats.
[4872.12 --> 4873.24]  We do merch messages.
[4873.24 --> 4877.84]  All you got to do to send one is go to LTTstore.com, add an item to your cart.
[4877.84 --> 4883.14]  Like, say, for example, the Tech Bro Vest, which is on sale for...
[4883.14 --> 4885.60]  I forget.
[4887.60 --> 4890.38]  I don't know.
[4890.50 --> 4890.74]  Whatever.
[4890.92 --> 4892.26]  I think it's 50% off.
[4892.60 --> 4894.32]  Like, I think it's very aggressively priced.
[4894.66 --> 4897.08]  So the Tech Bro Vest is on super sale.
[4897.28 --> 4903.42]  Or you could pick up one of these probably never-to-be-reordered MAC address button-up shirts,
[4903.90 --> 4906.26]  which are also deeply discounted.
[4906.26 --> 4909.86]  You add one of those to your cart and a little merch message box will pop up.
[4909.92 --> 4914.72]  That'll go to producer Dan, who will reply to your message with his broken, broken fingers.
[4915.00 --> 4915.88]  He's already...
[4915.88 --> 4919.22]  A lot of people figured out the tax write-off sale before we talked about it on the show.
[4919.46 --> 4919.66]  Yeah.
[4920.04 --> 4923.76]  So he'll reply to it, or he will curate it for me and Luke to talk about,
[4923.88 --> 4927.88]  or he will send it to someone who can get you an answer, or whatever the case may be.
[4927.88 --> 4932.08]  All the deals that you're supposed to say were written out on the dock, and you got some of them wrong.
[4932.22 --> 4932.76]  Well, where are they?
[4933.06 --> 4933.66]  On the dock.
[4933.74 --> 4934.36]  I don't see them.
[4934.78 --> 4935.98]  Right in the announcement.
[4935.98 --> 4936.92]  Oh, yeah.
[4937.04 --> 4937.26]  I see it.
[4937.30 --> 4938.86]  Well, I didn't scroll far enough.
[4939.68 --> 4940.66]  So it's...
[4940.66 --> 4942.04]  What are we looking at?
[4942.04 --> 4948.92]  Oh, 60% off the Tech Bro Vest, and 50% off the MAC address Oxford shirts.
[4949.38 --> 4952.32]  This deal literally dropped right now.
[4952.32 --> 4959.16]  We've also got $25 mystery hoodies, $10 mystery t-shirts, over 60% off the off-site laptop bag.
[4959.24 --> 4960.84]  That is a killer deal.
[4961.88 --> 4964.94]  It's a really, really nice laptop bag.
[4964.94 --> 4972.34]  25% off the more comprehensive MCM essential solution with 60% off the MCM starter solutions.
[4972.34 --> 4975.24]  We have $10 off the ScribeDriver bolt-action pen.
[4975.72 --> 4979.56]  And, wow, you get a free shaft extension with your stubby screwdriver.
[4979.56 --> 4982.04]  We don't want you to feel inadequate.
[4983.38 --> 4984.96]  What else is there for us to say?
[4985.02 --> 4987.22]  Yeah, free shipping, orders over $175.
[4987.62 --> 4994.30]  And we're happy to announce that more commuter backpacks will be available to ship starting next week.
[4994.44 --> 5000.16]  So that could be an easy way for you to reach that tax write-off sale shipping threshold.
[5000.16 --> 5001.20]  Nice.
[5001.82 --> 5002.18]  Nice.
[5002.58 --> 5004.98]  Should we do the other announcement after merch messages?
[5005.18 --> 5005.98]  I think so, right?
[5005.98 --> 5010.74]  A lot of people figured that one out before we actually talked about it on the show as well.
[5010.82 --> 5013.14]  Commuter backpacks are selling, like...
[5013.14 --> 5013.50]  Yeah.
[5013.84 --> 5014.74]  The hotcakes.
[5014.98 --> 5015.58]  Yeah, yeah.
[5015.82 --> 5017.64]  You guys, yeah, you guys figured it out.
[5018.26 --> 5020.30]  Well, good for you.
[5022.16 --> 5023.96]  Anywho, yeah, my loss, your gain.
[5024.04 --> 5025.10]  Let's do some merch messages.
[5026.28 --> 5028.24]  Sure, I've got a couple for you here.
[5028.24 --> 5031.72]  We're finally able to catch the WAN show live.
[5031.88 --> 5033.20]  Oh, wait, hold on one second.
[5033.52 --> 5035.78]  Mystery t-shirt is one of the best selling ones.
[5035.90 --> 5039.82]  Crystal pointed out, also, there's a bunch of cool stuff in the bonus bin.
[5040.46 --> 5042.10]  I'm not going to tell you what's in there.
[5042.26 --> 5042.58]  Oh.
[5042.74 --> 5043.54]  But she's right.
[5043.84 --> 5046.46]  There's some really cool stuff in the bonus bin.
[5048.34 --> 5048.56]  Oh.
[5049.18 --> 5051.92]  Jammon says, backpack enamel pin is $250.
[5052.30 --> 5053.42]  Yes, it comes with a backpack.
[5054.66 --> 5055.42]  That's a meme.
[5055.98 --> 5056.56]  Don't worry about it.
[5056.56 --> 5057.78]  Whoa, the bonus bin.
[5058.82 --> 5059.42]  What do you call them?
[5059.44 --> 5060.96]  We don't have to show it, but wow.
[5061.04 --> 5063.22]  Product upsell items.
[5063.52 --> 5066.62]  Yeah, so the bonus bin is stuff that you can get for free with your order.
[5068.68 --> 5071.58]  These are not cheap things.
[5071.68 --> 5072.32]  Okay, cool.
[5072.62 --> 5072.86]  Have fun.
[5073.06 --> 5073.58]  Neat, right?
[5073.70 --> 5074.08]  Good luck.
[5074.16 --> 5074.36]  Yeah.
[5075.30 --> 5075.60]  Neat.
[5076.32 --> 5076.94]  Good stuff, right?
[5077.28 --> 5077.86]  Tax write-off.
[5079.28 --> 5080.48]  Yeah, tax write-off sale.
[5080.78 --> 5083.96]  Time to make some money by writing off taxes.
[5084.10 --> 5085.30]  Yes, but pure profit.
[5085.30 --> 5086.04]  Pure profit.
[5086.04 --> 5087.64]  Okay, Mr. Dan, hit us.
[5088.82 --> 5089.26]  Sure.
[5089.54 --> 5092.18]  Finally able to catch a live WAN show again.
[5092.52 --> 5096.62]  What is the difference between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs that make NVIDIA so much better at
[5096.62 --> 5097.32]  ray tracing?
[5097.32 --> 5105.22]  Well, they have dedicated hardware for ray tracing, and they are a solid entire generation ahead
[5105.22 --> 5107.90]  of AMD in terms of developing their design.
[5108.90 --> 5112.04]  NVIDIA was the one that...
[5112.04 --> 5112.18]  They pushed it.
[5112.18 --> 5116.66]  Yep, they're the tip of the spear in terms of pushing ray tracing into the mainstream.
[5117.18 --> 5118.30]  They worked with developers.
[5118.58 --> 5123.84]  They worked to build the hardware that can do it back when they launched the RTX 20 series.
[5124.52 --> 5127.22]  So, like, when did the RTX 2080 launch?
[5127.36 --> 5129.10]  Like, that was a thousand years ago.
[5129.10 --> 5130.72]  September 20th, 2018.
[5131.44 --> 5135.62]  NVIDIA has been beating this ray tracing drum for over six years now.
[5135.98 --> 5137.38]  And AMD is playing catch-up.
[5137.46 --> 5141.48]  And that's what happens when someone else goes and they innovate a feature.
[5141.74 --> 5144.06]  And you kind of go, oh, crap.
[5144.06 --> 5148.06]  And you sort of implement it mostly in...
[5148.86 --> 5152.92]  I don't want to say software, because they were definitely still using hardware to do
[5152.92 --> 5154.44]  it in the early generations.
[5154.44 --> 5160.18]  But, you know, essentially using more general purpose compute in order to handle ray tracing.
[5160.38 --> 5163.22]  Then you kind of, you know, you build some ray tracing hardware.
[5163.88 --> 5165.60]  But it's your first crack at it.
[5165.66 --> 5167.38]  It just takes time to catch up.
[5167.56 --> 5172.18]  NVIDIA was all in on ray tracing right out of the gate with the 20 series.
[5172.18 --> 5178.04]  And that has paid off for them, for gamers that appreciate ray traced lighting, which
[5178.04 --> 5180.22]  isn't all gamers, but certainly is some gamers.
[5180.62 --> 5183.46]  I talked to some folks that are like, oh, I think it looks worse.
[5183.54 --> 5184.44]  I hate the lower FPS.
[5184.76 --> 5186.26]  And that's totally their prerogative.
[5186.38 --> 5189.20]  But I talked to other people that are like, I won't play a game without ray tracing on.
[5190.36 --> 5191.04]  That's a thing.
[5191.40 --> 5192.58]  And you don't have to agree.
[5193.16 --> 5196.08]  But you do have to understand and acknowledge that that's a thing.
[5196.08 --> 5198.20]  And for some people, it has a lot of value.
[5198.20 --> 5202.30]  Oh, yeah.
[5202.38 --> 5203.36]  More merge messages.
[5203.90 --> 5204.30]  Sorry.
[5205.04 --> 5207.22]  If no SATA 4, why no U.2?
[5207.42 --> 5209.70]  Instead on motherboards for expanded storage.
[5209.90 --> 5212.98]  M.2 drives waste limited board surface area.
[5213.22 --> 5214.92]  They're okay for low profile laptops.
[5215.06 --> 5218.06]  But desktop cases have room for mounting hard drives.
[5218.06 --> 5222.16]  That's a good question.
[5222.92 --> 5227.64]  Why don't we just mount drives in drive bays and use cable interfaces?
[5227.94 --> 5231.72]  Well, one of the reasons that we wouldn't want to do that is SATA cables are cheap.
[5232.26 --> 5233.88]  U.2 cables are not.
[5235.46 --> 5237.70]  It's a really high speed signal.
[5238.28 --> 5242.84]  And putting it directly on the board means that the trace length is going to be much lower.
[5242.84 --> 5256.02]  If you were to try it, I think the last time that U.2 was really present in mainstream consumer boards was like PCIe Gen 3.
[5256.74 --> 5262.16]  Did we ever see Gen 4 U.2 really take off on consumer boards?
[5262.24 --> 5263.16]  Can you guys think of anything?
[5263.86 --> 5266.24]  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, guys.
[5266.24 --> 5269.52]  But it's an expensive connector.
[5269.84 --> 5275.32]  It's an expensive cable because it's a super, super high speed interface.
[5276.14 --> 5287.96]  And the commodity consumer computer industry, guys, we're talking fractions of a penny of savings sometimes that influence design decisions.
[5288.62 --> 5289.58]  SATA was cheap.
[5290.20 --> 5295.88]  SATA was cheaper than IDE to implement because it required so many fewer conductors.
[5295.88 --> 5297.64]  It's like, where does innovation come from?
[5297.68 --> 5298.70]  It comes from cost savings.
[5299.40 --> 5306.82]  M.2 is relatively affordable to implement because the trace lengths are so low in order to maintain those data speeds.
[5307.28 --> 5313.64]  So I would say that U.2 is just simply not happening on consumer.
[5314.00 --> 5321.52]  And the only reason to have a U.2 drive would be if you need like a shed load of NAND flash chips.
[5322.32 --> 5326.50]  Otherwise, you can cram as many as you would want on an M.2.
[5326.56 --> 5328.38]  Like you can buy 8 terabyte M.2s.
[5328.58 --> 5331.18]  The only impediment to doing that is the cost.
[5331.68 --> 5339.18]  So are you going to tell me that people need a 40 gigabit or a 40 gigabit, a 40 terabyte drive?
[5340.04 --> 5342.30]  Like, no, they're not going to be able to afford that anyway.
[5342.44 --> 5343.52]  So what are we even talking about?
[5343.54 --> 5346.90]  We don't need to build a 2.5 inch drive for this.
[5346.90 --> 5348.60]  And they do exist.
[5348.66 --> 5351.20]  You could buy an enterprise drive and you could put it in your computer.
[5351.20 --> 5358.06]  You could put a card into your PCIe slot and you could run like a U.3 off to your card or whatever.
[5358.68 --> 5360.58]  Or you can get an M.2 adapter.
[5360.74 --> 5366.18]  You can get a little M.2 carrier card and you can put a U.2 or U.3 interface on there, run that off to a drive.
[5366.26 --> 5366.74]  I do that.
[5366.74 --> 5373.30]  We kind of knew those cables were going to be brutal right away because the second you feel it, it's like, that's expensive.
[5373.58 --> 5373.74]  Yeah.
[5374.26 --> 5379.58]  But I just don't think it makes a ton of sense for consumers, especially when you consider the additional costs.
[5383.74 --> 5384.40]  Next one, Dan?
[5385.78 --> 5386.94]  It's only two in the middle.
[5387.16 --> 5390.40]  I think I'm going to move into sponsors now.
[5391.44 --> 5391.84]  No.
[5392.18 --> 5393.46]  We have an announcement.
[5393.68 --> 5394.36]  We have one more announcement.
[5394.36 --> 5395.02]  We have an announcement.
[5395.86 --> 5400.86]  First of all, I think I covered this in the pre-show, but we are doing the hirings.
[5401.50 --> 5404.86]  I just wanted to remind people to check out the careers page on linusmediagroup.com.
[5405.92 --> 5410.84]  There's a variety of positions at Creative Warehouse and Linus Media Group that are up right now.
[5412.52 --> 5416.02]  There's going to be a project manager role put up for floatplane in a bit.
[5416.14 --> 5417.92]  It's not up yet, but it's coming.
[5418.32 --> 5421.32]  At Creative Warehouse, they're doing a part-time photographer and photo editor,
[5421.32 --> 5424.82]  a full-time graphic designer, and a full-time supply chain manager.
[5425.04 --> 5427.00]  All the Linus Media Group roles are full-time.
[5427.14 --> 5429.90]  There's two test technicians that we're hiring.
[5430.08 --> 5431.76]  So there's actually five positions.
[5431.82 --> 5432.02]  Same job description.
[5432.22 --> 5432.40]  Yeah.
[5433.74 --> 5439.82]  One full-time logistics coordinator, one full-time content writer for the labs and potentially other technical content,
[5440.62 --> 5444.76]  things like short circuit, stuff like that, and a full-time testing coordinator.
[5445.14 --> 5446.38]  So go check those out.
[5446.38 --> 5447.64]  You want a link for the job posting?
[5448.46 --> 5449.50]  No, they're memeing.
[5449.68 --> 5449.98]  Okay.
[5450.16 --> 5450.98]  I was going to say...
[5450.98 --> 5451.98]  Rysaw was memeing.
[5452.16 --> 5453.70]  Rysaw was trying to trigger Luke.
[5453.72 --> 5454.26]  That's the...
[5454.26 --> 5456.12]  Can I get a link to that job posting?
[5456.54 --> 5457.90]  That's the barrier of entry.
[5458.24 --> 5459.86]  Immediately followed with slash s.
[5460.02 --> 5461.76]  They knew how triggered you were going to be.
[5462.74 --> 5464.20]  Immediately bothered me so much.
[5464.20 --> 5464.48]  I know.
[5465.04 --> 5465.92]  Luke's turning red.
[5465.92 --> 5468.08]  I can see him shaking from here.
[5468.08 --> 5469.16]  Dude, he was so upset.
[5469.16 --> 5475.82]  For Luke, that is literally like the first IQ test that you need to pass to get a job at this company.
[5476.16 --> 5478.88]  There's a few, too, but that's an early fail.
[5479.72 --> 5485.70]  And the next one is that the labs website has had a pretty major update.
[5485.98 --> 5487.00]  Oh, this is exciting.
[5487.10 --> 5488.10]  This is more of a topic.
[5488.24 --> 5489.30]  This is less of an announcement.
[5489.80 --> 5490.22]  Oh, okay.
[5490.44 --> 5491.00]  I mean, sure.
[5491.00 --> 5491.82]  I think it's a topic.
[5491.82 --> 5492.34]  We're doing this topic then.
[5492.44 --> 5492.72]  I don't know.
[5492.80 --> 5492.94]  Sure.
[5493.02 --> 5493.16]  Yeah.
[5493.18 --> 5494.54]  Let's talk about the labs website.
[5495.02 --> 5498.64]  It probably looks different if you haven't seen it in a while.
[5498.64 --> 5501.58]  There's a lot of reasons why it's really cool.
[5501.76 --> 5502.12]  Honestly.
[5502.36 --> 5503.22]  Let's start with the buttons.
[5503.66 --> 5508.52]  Well, what I'm going to start with is that we had Dan, the leader of the labs web team.
[5508.90 --> 5509.80]  Other different Dan.
[5510.04 --> 5510.28]  Yes.
[5510.38 --> 5510.92]  Not this Dan.
[5511.06 --> 5511.44]  Other Dan.
[5511.54 --> 5513.14]  Luke's Dan, not Luke's Dan.
[5514.10 --> 5514.84]  Bird Dan.
[5517.20 --> 5518.06]  It's confusing.
[5519.34 --> 5523.28]  And it has little GIFs showing off all the different features, and it's actually really well written.
[5523.40 --> 5528.42]  So if you want to really dive into everything that changed, this is probably the way to do it, to be honest.
[5528.74 --> 5531.16]  But if you're lazy and you want us to just do it for you...
[5531.16 --> 5532.06]  Then we can do that.
[5532.40 --> 5533.78]  Here's the shoddier version.
[5534.08 --> 5534.44]  Yeah.
[5534.56 --> 5534.76]  Yeah.
[5534.82 --> 5535.54]  What did you want to see?
[5535.62 --> 5535.88]  The buttons.
[5536.06 --> 5536.32]  Okay.
[5536.46 --> 5536.86]  These ones?
[5537.02 --> 5537.26]  Yeah.
[5537.48 --> 5543.60]  So this was, I believe, an idea from Sebastian that was iterated on by Dan, and I love it.
[5543.60 --> 5549.60]  Because what I believe it was Sebastian was pointing out is that the new categories page is fantastic.
[5550.88 --> 5553.10]  And he wanted to be surfaced more.
[5553.60 --> 5555.98]  So the idea was to put them down here.
[5555.98 --> 5559.86]  And it's kind of nice, in my opinion, because this shows off the color coding.
[5560.40 --> 5563.14]  So do you see the colors of all the buttons here?
[5563.22 --> 5571.62]  If you scroll down and you see the tags and the colored bars down here, they coordinate, which I think is genuinely actually pretty sweet.
[5571.62 --> 5575.18]  But the new comparison page, I'm going to go into GPUs, for example.
[5577.06 --> 5578.20]  Sorry, not comparison page.
[5578.26 --> 5579.54]  This is a new categories page.
[5580.04 --> 5581.22]  So now we have this.
[5581.34 --> 5583.92]  You can see all of the different stats in here.
[5583.92 --> 5588.62]  And you can filter by a wide variety of different things.
[5588.76 --> 5589.42]  So you can be like...
[5589.42 --> 5589.86]  Like how many slots?
[5589.92 --> 5590.68]  Or what kind of memory?
[5590.76 --> 5593.70]  How much memory if you want, you know, a decent sized frame buffer?
[5593.90 --> 5599.82]  I want a card that's going to fit in my, like, fairly small form factor case.
[5600.04 --> 5600.32]  Sick.
[5600.32 --> 5602.84]  That has, I don't know.
[5602.98 --> 5603.96]  Yeah, this much memory.
[5604.16 --> 5606.52]  Okay, here's all the cards that the lab has tested.
[5606.54 --> 5608.50]  And that uses a power connector that doesn't light on fire.
[5609.16 --> 5609.54]  Yeah.
[5609.54 --> 5615.10]  So this is all the cards that fit that filter.
[5615.70 --> 5617.34]  Are the columns customizable?
[5617.54 --> 5619.02]  I don't think so.
[5619.72 --> 5620.12]  No.
[5620.94 --> 5622.00]  But I don't know.
[5622.06 --> 5622.52]  It is what it is.
[5622.80 --> 5624.28]  The compare bin over here.
[5624.36 --> 5624.84]  There you go.
[5625.02 --> 5626.28]  You've got your thing.
[5626.36 --> 5626.72]  Hey, look.
[5626.76 --> 5627.54]  It has a tool tip now.
[5627.54 --> 5628.08]  That's cool.
[5628.46 --> 5629.14]  That was fast.
[5629.48 --> 5631.26]  So you can add to comparison bin.
[5631.26 --> 5631.98]  I asked for that yesterday.
[5633.18 --> 5634.34]  And it's already done.
[5634.56 --> 5636.10]  Like near end of day, too.
[5636.16 --> 5636.32]  Yeah.
[5636.50 --> 5637.26]  No, that's sick.
[5637.26 --> 5641.14]  So you can add to comparison bin from here, which is awesome.
[5641.56 --> 5645.20]  So, I mean, let's say this just narrowed it down to three things.
[5645.28 --> 5646.82]  I'm going to add the three top cards here.
[5648.02 --> 5650.52]  And then the comparison bin has also had.
[5650.58 --> 5651.32]  Oh, Dan, do you want to?
[5651.38 --> 5651.98]  Oh, yeah, there we go.
[5652.06 --> 5652.20]  Yep.
[5652.44 --> 5654.94]  The comparison bin has also had a big update.
[5655.76 --> 5657.96]  This is my favorite one out of everything.
[5658.80 --> 5659.78]  So, well, okay.
[5659.86 --> 5660.58]  You can see this now.
[5660.72 --> 5665.38]  If you have two, like, a mixture of things, you can select which subset you want to see.
[5665.38 --> 5668.90]  So if you added, like, power supplies and mice and whatever, you can do that.
[5669.18 --> 5670.42]  Click on detail comparison.
[5670.86 --> 5673.62]  And now the comparison bin looks like this, which is way nicer.
[5673.92 --> 5674.50]  Super cool.
[5674.68 --> 5678.86]  The photos don't automatically, like, destroy the viewability of all the data right away.
[5678.92 --> 5680.10]  But you can show them if you want.
[5680.22 --> 5684.36]  So you can see all the different photos and even scroll through the different photos of the different products that you're viewing.
[5684.52 --> 5685.00]  Very cool.
[5685.02 --> 5686.60]  And then tuck those away when you don't want them.
[5686.60 --> 5695.32]  A feature that took some tweaking to really, like, make it right, but I'm super happy with personally, is the highlight differences button.
[5695.52 --> 5699.86]  So you can do this, and then it shows you, like, what actually changes between them.
[5700.68 --> 5701.18]  Very cool.
[5701.24 --> 5704.46]  So, like, what do I need to, like, care about between these different cards?
[5704.52 --> 5705.24]  What's going to matter?
[5705.32 --> 5708.18]  What's going to change depending on what selection I have?
[5709.08 --> 5711.52]  You can see the graphs for all of them in here.
[5711.66 --> 5714.02]  The graphs are configurable as well, as always.
[5716.06 --> 5717.02]  Yeah, it's good stuff.
[5717.10 --> 5718.90]  I think you can even...
[5718.90 --> 5719.34]  Yes.
[5719.50 --> 5722.48]  So you can take one of the cards off or put it back on.
[5722.94 --> 5727.84]  So if you, like, you know, don't want to reconfigure your entire comparison bin, but you're like, all right, I'm not going to get this one.
[5727.88 --> 5728.56]  It sucks or whatever.
[5728.82 --> 5730.36]  You can uncheck that.
[5732.16 --> 5734.28]  Yeah, it's pretty great.
[5734.28 --> 5736.38]  The search is a lot better now than it used to be.
[5736.38 --> 5736.62]  Yep.
[5738.14 --> 5739.84]  I'm trying to think of what I'm mixing.
[5739.96 --> 5741.04]  I'm probably mixing things.
[5741.12 --> 5743.00]  I'm going to go to Dan's article to figure this out.
[5743.12 --> 5748.44]  It's going to be a ton of work for us to get, like, you know, every card, you know, populated in here, you know?
[5748.48 --> 5748.70]  Oh, right.
[5748.80 --> 5749.64]  The product cards, obviously.
[5749.64 --> 5761.34]  But the goal is still, and we have not deviated from this mission, the goal is still to turn the Lab's website into just an absolutely incredible resource.
[5761.34 --> 5770.86]  Whether you're buying something brand new, whether you're buying something off of Facebook Marketplace, to make it easy to make an informed decision.
[5771.80 --> 5774.10]  And there's been some setbacks along the way.
[5774.10 --> 5781.60]  There's definitely, you know, been some mistakes, but make no mistake, Labs.
[5781.80 --> 5782.60]  We're still cooking.
[5782.84 --> 5784.22]  The Labs is still cooking.
[5784.62 --> 5788.50]  It's not finished, but it is absolutely still cooking.
[5788.50 --> 5791.38]  And we haven't lost sight of what the mission is.
[5791.42 --> 5792.94]  And it's not to make money.
[5793.90 --> 5797.28]  It's to create an incredible resource for the tech community.
[5798.72 --> 5807.58]  And it's been very frustrating, I think, to see a narrative built that, like, Labs was somehow, like, a negative thing in some way.
[5807.64 --> 5809.18]  It was never meant to be a negative thing.
[5809.56 --> 5811.84]  We are human, and we've made some mistakes.
[5812.28 --> 5814.60]  But, man, is it ever coming along.
[5814.78 --> 5815.66]  Trying to make it cool, man.
[5815.74 --> 5817.10]  That is super cool.
[5817.10 --> 5818.38]  One more cool thing to point out.
[5818.46 --> 5822.56]  I think I somewhat mentioned these, but these product cards have been updated as well.
[5822.80 --> 5827.54]  You might remember earlier in the year we added the, like, blog section to the right here.
[5828.18 --> 5831.36]  But the product cards over here have gotten an update as well.
[5832.10 --> 5832.60]  Very cool.
[5832.74 --> 5836.56]  And these, so now they don't just have the blurb.
[5836.82 --> 5838.18]  They also have the tags.
[5838.24 --> 5839.88]  This is another thing that went through a few iterations.
[5840.32 --> 5843.90]  There was an idea of just having the tags at one part, at one point.
[5843.90 --> 5846.98]  But that didn't really, like, it felt like something.
[5847.10 --> 5848.06]  It was not really there.
[5848.56 --> 5848.64]  Yeah.
[5848.64 --> 5852.66]  So I think Dan went through a couple iterations and ended up on this one.
[5853.22 --> 5861.84]  I mean, I might be biased here, but I really like how this page looks and feels right now, personally.
[5861.84 --> 5865.54]  Just even having all the categories listed here.
[5865.66 --> 5867.84]  There's a sense of, like...
[5868.40 --> 5870.22]  I feel a little guided.
[5870.52 --> 5871.56]  It feels full.
[5871.84 --> 5872.84]  It feels saturated.
[5873.08 --> 5873.92]  It feels good.
[5874.04 --> 5875.02]  There's stuff there.
[5875.94 --> 5880.48]  You know, categories, you can still find them under here, but they're not tucked away anymore.
[5880.64 --> 5881.46]  They're right here.
[5881.50 --> 5882.50]  You can see the color coding.
[5882.58 --> 5883.00]  It's right there.
[5883.04 --> 5884.18]  You can see the tags on here.
[5884.18 --> 5889.80]  So you can quickly identify if that one matters to you or not.
[5890.18 --> 5891.46]  But we're also not...
[5891.46 --> 5899.64]  We were having this debate on, like, if we put too many tags, too much information on this section, it would almost dissuade people from...
[5899.64 --> 5900.84]  Yeah, yeah.
[5901.12 --> 5901.62]  Very cool.
[5901.74 --> 5902.38]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5902.42 --> 5904.20]  With it pre-selected, as you can see right here.
[5904.22 --> 5904.60]  Very, very, very cool.
[5904.60 --> 5909.48]  It would almost dissuade people from clicking into things and, like, effectively learning more.
[5909.62 --> 5912.98]  And one of the missions of the Labs website is to give people a resource.
[5913.22 --> 5923.86]  So we were almost worried that by surfacing too much information on the, like, card view, that it could take away from what we want the site to do.
[5924.94 --> 5927.36]  If people are like, oh, you're just trying to, like, give people to click more.
[5927.92 --> 5929.56]  There are no ads on the site.
[5930.12 --> 5930.90]  Literally zero.
[5931.04 --> 5932.30]  And it's been, like, years.
[5932.30 --> 5934.96]  We gain nothing from keeping you here.
[5935.08 --> 5938.32]  We just actually want you to, like, find more information.
[5938.46 --> 5940.12]  We don't just want to surface level things.
[5940.20 --> 5944.76]  We're expecting that someone coming to the Labs website is looking for more and wants to go deeper.
[5944.86 --> 5946.30]  So we want to cater to that experience.
[5946.72 --> 5949.42]  But anyways, I'm incredibly proud of this.
[5949.56 --> 5952.68]  I think the web team has done an extremely good job.
[5952.80 --> 5954.78]  I think the website looks fantastic.
[5955.28 --> 5955.90]  And we're hiring.
[5956.52 --> 5960.34]  It's time to put even more resources into populating it.
[5960.34 --> 5960.42]  The web team isn't hiring.
[5960.64 --> 5961.12]  No, sorry.
[5961.12 --> 5963.78]  But the Labs team is hiring.
[5964.60 --> 5970.22]  CMD Karini asks, is the long-term plan to subsidize Labs content with LTT?
[5971.52 --> 5974.44]  Well, if it wasn't, boy, have we ever deviated from the plan.
[5976.72 --> 5979.48]  To the tune of seven figures.
[5979.82 --> 5979.88]  Yes.
[5979.88 --> 5980.32]  Yeah, millions.
[5980.66 --> 5980.92]  Yeah.
[5980.92 --> 5984.88]  Depending on how you calculated, it could be more than seven figures.
[5986.90 --> 5988.28]  Yes, definitely.
[5988.90 --> 5991.38]  And yes, Dark Rainbow, we want the Labs to succeed.
[5991.82 --> 5996.92]  And we are extremely committed to helping the Labs succeed.
[5996.92 --> 6005.78]  There's even little things like, and I know this matters to like very few people, but I know this matters if you ask them to very few people.
[6005.92 --> 6007.38]  But I think it actually does matter.
[6007.38 --> 6012.86]  If I move my mouse over this card, the little arrow in the corner turns.
[6013.34 --> 6017.16]  And the brand and model gets underlined.
[6017.26 --> 6019.54]  And if I highlight over the plus, whoop.
[6019.88 --> 6020.86]  A little nice design.
[6020.98 --> 6022.14]  A little nice little animation.
[6022.38 --> 6024.70]  Like, the site feels really smooth.
[6024.98 --> 6031.96]  There's when you go into an article now, like this section right here is going to go with you.
[6032.48 --> 6032.82]  Whoop.
[6033.14 --> 6035.94]  Like, everything just feels really nice.
[6036.14 --> 6037.02]  I don't know.
[6037.06 --> 6037.68]  It's fast.
[6038.16 --> 6038.82]  It feels good.
[6038.86 --> 6039.42]  It looks good.
[6039.52 --> 6040.80]  I'm very happy with the Lab site.
[6041.12 --> 6041.28]  Yeah.
[6041.28 --> 6047.06]  The site's ready for a lot more product data.
[6047.42 --> 6047.52]  Yeah.
[6047.60 --> 6050.76]  Which is why we're, you know, hiring testers and hiring testing coordinators.
[6050.92 --> 6051.92]  And we're getting the Labs.
[6052.50 --> 6052.94]  Yeah.
[6053.04 --> 6053.52]  Things are good.
[6054.70 --> 6059.54]  Crusty Trombone asks, is there a timeline for new component categories like main boards to be added?
[6060.00 --> 6061.22]  Right now, no.
[6061.22 --> 6066.78]  I think one of the big mistakes that we made was to try to go too broad too fast.
[6066.78 --> 6072.12]  So right now, we are laser focused on the peripherals that we have there now.
[6072.28 --> 6078.46]  Power supplies, CPUs, GPUs, and getting ramped.
[6078.52 --> 6086.06]  Because, like, I don't know if I've made this clear in the past, but our goal is not just to test
[6086.06 --> 6095.02]  every Ventus, TriFlow, Strix, like, every version of every GPU.
[6095.02 --> 6105.48]  But to have enough capacity to do that and start making our way backward so that if you're upgrading,
[6105.78 --> 6112.44]  you can literally take your current card and compare it to all of your different options to upgrade to.
[6112.44 --> 6115.64]  Now, it's obviously not going to be perfect, right?
[6115.64 --> 6119.56]  Because we might not run with the same CPU that you have in your system.
[6119.70 --> 6122.70]  But it will at least be a valuable point of reference.
[6123.26 --> 6125.12]  And that's our goal in the longer term.
[6125.12 --> 6129.20]  Another just little reminder to check out that blog post that Dan posted.
[6129.58 --> 6130.50]  It's well written.
[6130.68 --> 6133.28]  The GIFs are painstakingly crafted.
[6133.88 --> 6135.76]  And there's probably a couple things in there that I missed.
[6136.04 --> 6139.70]  So if you're interested in the lab site, I would highly suggest checking that out.
[6139.72 --> 6142.70]  But yeah, man, it's starting to feel really good.
[6142.70 --> 6147.54]  There's still so much more we can do with the lab site, which is also exciting.
[6147.96 --> 6152.64]  Like, as much as this makes it feel, like, full and all that other type of stuff that I said,
[6152.96 --> 6155.40]  there's so many more features that could be coming down the line.
[6156.08 --> 6159.28]  I'm not going to name any of them now, but there's some really good ideas that will
[6159.28 --> 6168.02]  really continue to push the usability of the site and help people end up with a decision.
[6169.06 --> 6170.90]  That's another one of the things that we've been talking about.
[6170.90 --> 6173.70]  What does the lab site eventually need to be able to do?
[6174.22 --> 6176.44]  And it's been really interesting for information for a while.
[6176.56 --> 6180.64]  But as we move forward into the future, we want to help you come to a conclusion more.
[6181.56 --> 6184.14]  Right now, it's still in the great for information stage.
[6184.26 --> 6188.88]  And we think stuff like that categories view that we're showing off can really push forward
[6188.88 --> 6190.46]  towards helping people come to a conclusion.
[6190.90 --> 6192.88]  But there is still more that we can do.
[6193.58 --> 6199.22]  And it's exciting to, you know, have more things to work on.
[6199.22 --> 6200.98]  Yeah, it's good.
[6202.38 --> 6203.10]  Yeah, buddy.
[6203.84 --> 6204.44]  Let's go.
[6204.86 --> 6205.56]  Yeah, buddy.
[6205.72 --> 6206.28]  Let's go.
[6206.66 --> 6207.60]  Okay, moving on.
[6208.46 --> 6209.76]  Oh, sponsor spot, I guess.
[6210.50 --> 6211.18]  Is that right?
[6211.34 --> 6212.00]  I think so.
[6212.80 --> 6213.40]  I don't know, Dan.
[6213.48 --> 6214.08]  You tell us.
[6214.08 --> 6216.36]  Yeah, you have a not a normal spot.
[6217.64 --> 6218.90]  It's a takeover.
[6219.38 --> 6219.78]  Wow.
[6219.86 --> 6222.20]  We need to stop tossing the doc around.
[6222.44 --> 6222.74]  Sorry.
[6223.14 --> 6223.80]  My goodness.
[6224.70 --> 6227.48]  It's like scrolled me to the very top when something happened and stuff.
[6227.64 --> 6228.42]  It was wild.
[6228.64 --> 6232.66]  Anyways, Threat Locker has taken over this WAN show, as you might have seen at the beginning
[6232.66 --> 6233.20]  of the show.
[6233.22 --> 6234.24]  So they take all the sponsor spots?
[6234.26 --> 6235.66]  They take all the sponsor spots.
[6235.66 --> 6236.28]  Threat Locker.
[6236.40 --> 6236.78]  All of it.
[6236.78 --> 6237.56]  Is that who took it?
[6237.66 --> 6237.88]  Yeah.
[6238.12 --> 6238.68]  Threat Locker.
[6238.68 --> 6240.36]  So they've taken over all the sponsor spots.
[6240.36 --> 6241.22]  They took over all the sponsor spots.
[6241.22 --> 6244.78]  So if I tried to talk about another sponsor, like, it would...
[6244.78 --> 6245.20]  Threat Locker.
[6245.30 --> 6246.94]  You know, their security method...
[6246.94 --> 6249.08]  My mic would stop working if not.
[6249.16 --> 6250.82]  Their security method is default and I.
[6250.82 --> 6252.28]  Okay, I won't talk about another sponsor.
[6253.50 --> 6254.54]  Fair enough.
[6254.66 --> 6255.32]  Okay, carry on.
[6255.42 --> 6255.90]  That was a...
[6255.90 --> 6257.88]  I'm pretty happy with that, actually.
[6257.90 --> 6258.42]  That was pretty clever.
[6258.48 --> 6259.12]  That was pretty good.
[6259.14 --> 6259.76]  That was pretty good.
[6260.66 --> 6264.56]  Anyways, Zero Trust World is one of the talking points that I can go over.
[6264.62 --> 6265.80]  So I went to Zero Trust World.
[6265.80 --> 6270.82]  Unfortunately, I missed, actually, some parts of it that I think were really probably cool
[6270.82 --> 6274.78]  because I flew into Toronto Pearson where that plane flipped over.
[6276.32 --> 6277.76]  So my flight was...
[6277.76 --> 6279.10]  My connecting flight was cancelled.
[6279.22 --> 6280.48]  So I missed, like, the whole first day.
[6280.50 --> 6280.96]  Could have been worse.
[6281.04 --> 6281.76]  Could have been your flight.
[6283.74 --> 6284.90]  That would have been kind of cool.
[6285.02 --> 6285.64]  Everybody survived.
[6285.80 --> 6286.32]  I would have been down.
[6287.36 --> 6290.50]  You could have been talked about on the internet.
[6291.64 --> 6294.18]  Yeah, he's never been talked about on the internet before.
[6294.20 --> 6294.28]  Never.
[6294.28 --> 6294.76]  Never happened.
[6294.76 --> 6294.84]  Never happened.
[6295.16 --> 6296.62]  They had some cool panels.
[6296.82 --> 6299.04]  They had hands-on stuff that I had some fun with.
[6299.08 --> 6300.14]  They had cool guest speakers.
[6301.48 --> 6306.10]  They had Reggie Fils-Aimé from, like, ex-Nintendo.
[6306.38 --> 6307.56]  That's pretty wild.
[6307.68 --> 6307.98]  I don't know.
[6308.76 --> 6309.28]  I really...
[6309.28 --> 6312.94]  I think I talked about this on the last one's show, but I liked the ducky panels.
[6313.64 --> 6318.88]  They had Hack 5 rubber ducky panels where we learned how to do a bunch of different stuff
[6318.88 --> 6320.18]  with those, which was cool.
[6320.34 --> 6322.06]  What was, like, the best thing you learned how to do?
[6322.06 --> 6326.98]  Well, they gave us a ducky, and then Aja and I were sitting there.
[6328.90 --> 6330.90]  And we ended up finding...
[6330.90 --> 6334.68]  So back in the day, if you've seen the channel's Super Fun video, it's got a ton of views, so
[6334.68 --> 6335.08]  you might have.
[6335.08 --> 6345.26]  In high school, I found this screen-melting program online, and then I messed with it a little bit and changed it slightly and kind of made it my own.
[6345.46 --> 6350.80]  But, you know, I didn't make the... I made fairly minor changes.
[6350.80 --> 6357.06]  There is a maintained version of the original source code online that updates it to support, like, multiple monitors and all that kind of stuff.
[6357.10 --> 6357.78]  You can find it on GitHub.
[6357.92 --> 6358.74]  It's just called Screen Melter.
[6358.74 --> 6362.94]  So I didn't have access to my version, and there's a better version now anyway.
[6363.14 --> 6370.96]  So we downloaded the executable from that, and I got it to run by having it just...
[6370.96 --> 6372.76]  It had to access the file on the computer.
[6373.02 --> 6377.04]  And Aja was like, well, that's dumb, because if you plug it into someone else's computer, the file's not going to be there.
[6377.26 --> 6382.08]  So we figured out how to get it to self-reference the rubber ducky itself for file storage.
[6382.08 --> 6385.08]  So you just plug it in, and it screen melts, which was fantastic.
[6385.32 --> 6387.48]  It wasn't really in the scope of the presentation, but...
[6387.48 --> 6389.36]  Script kitty confirmed, says Corey G.
[6390.32 --> 6393.98]  Not quite, but I did take the beginning thing from somebody else.
[6395.42 --> 6397.66]  Anyways, it was fun.
[6397.80 --> 6398.42]  We were messing around.
[6398.52 --> 6398.98]  That's so defensive.
[6399.02 --> 6399.78]  We took things a little bit...
[6399.78 --> 6402.22]  Well, I mean, there was a stage where it was like that.
[6402.22 --> 6402.32]  I'm just bugging you.
[6402.40 --> 6404.18]  But I did actually do cool things to it.
[6404.50 --> 6406.50]  I made it, like, network deployable and all this other stuff.
[6406.60 --> 6406.82]  Anyways.
[6409.50 --> 6410.82]  Yeah, it was a fun event.
[6410.82 --> 6411.16]  What else did you do, Luke?
[6412.08 --> 6412.90]  Oh, yeah.
[6413.08 --> 6413.94]  Don't worry about it.
[6414.30 --> 6414.78]  Cool.
[6415.02 --> 6416.76]  Anyway, tell us more about ZTW.
[6417.14 --> 6417.48]  Yeah.
[6420.08 --> 6421.64]  There was...
[6421.64 --> 6423.68]  A lot of the main stage events were cool.
[6424.08 --> 6426.62]  The hack panels were probably the most interesting ones to me.
[6427.50 --> 6432.34]  It's funny how certain people, like, implicate themselves because they can't help boasting.
[6433.56 --> 6434.84]  Certain kinds of people.
[6435.04 --> 6436.20]  I don't do anything anymore.
[6436.32 --> 6437.10]  It's been a long time.
[6437.40 --> 6440.46]  It's been, like, genuinely closer to 20 years than not.
[6441.20 --> 6441.72]  Like, it's weird.
[6441.72 --> 6442.82]  It's been a long time since what?
[6444.96 --> 6445.36]  Nothing.
[6448.18 --> 6453.98]  Anyways, on a panel at ZeroTest World, they announced the addition of some cool features.
[6453.98 --> 6455.26]  One of them is called Insights.
[6455.36 --> 6462.76]  It allows you to collect data from millions of endpoints worldwide and present them as actionable information, saving lots of time that might be spent researching.
[6462.76 --> 6472.74]  Web Control, which lets you build a library of websites from an always-updating list of ones automatically identified as suspicious and blocks your endpoints from accessing them without permission.
[6473.12 --> 6483.22]  And Patch Management, which scans devices for outdated applications and inspects the proposed updates for anything that might make your environment less secure or unstable.
[6483.22 --> 6489.60]  And then lets you apply the patches according to your preset policies.
[6489.60 --> 6492.70]  So this is all ThreatLocker, by the way.
[6492.76 --> 6492.96]  Yeah.
[6493.06 --> 6497.94]  ThreatLocker, as I previously mentioned, is a default deny type system.
[6498.16 --> 6504.18]  So it can be very useful at not letting something happen.
[6504.42 --> 6506.92]  I don't have their exact talking points for this in front of me.
[6506.92 --> 6509.20]  But the idea is that they're not reactive.
[6509.50 --> 6509.70]  Yeah.
[6509.78 --> 6511.88]  Or their focus is not being reactive.
[6512.00 --> 6512.64]  It's not being proactive.
[6512.64 --> 6518.98]  So they try to block things before they can potentially even happen, which is pretty cool.
[6519.38 --> 6522.40]  They lean really heavily on the whole Zero Trust concept.
[6522.76 --> 6525.06]  Zero Trust is not necessarily their thing.
[6525.16 --> 6527.14]  It's a concept that has existed for a long time.
[6527.70 --> 6531.24]  There's products from other brands that reference the term Zero Trust.
[6531.24 --> 6534.42]  But I've always kind of liked that approach to things.
[6534.56 --> 6537.00]  And they embrace it very heavily.
[6537.14 --> 6538.96]  It's kind of the core of their company.
[6539.36 --> 6541.86]  They have a big emphasis on their support.
[6542.30 --> 6545.94]  They always have real people behind the scenes helping out with their platform.
[6546.30 --> 6548.24]  And their whole cyber hero thing is pretty cool.
[6548.56 --> 6550.56]  Yeah, that might have helped during the hackening.
[6550.92 --> 6554.80]  Yeah, you can pull in support, basically, which is pretty great.
[6555.80 --> 6558.70]  Oh, yeah, there's a note here that says maybe they could have helped during the hack.
[6558.70 --> 6558.98]  Yeah.
[6558.98 --> 6563.84]  Yeah, honestly, I don't technically know because we haven't used that yet.
[6563.84 --> 6564.94]  Sure as heck wouldn't have heard.
[6565.24 --> 6566.00]  Yeah, for sure.
[6566.10 --> 6567.08]  To just have someone.
[6567.56 --> 6568.74]  At least a reassuring.
[6568.76 --> 6569.56]  With a cool head.
[6569.56 --> 6570.12]  Extra set of ideas.
[6570.14 --> 6571.24]  Yes, yes.
[6571.26 --> 6572.08]  Because I was not.
[6572.86 --> 6574.26]  It's often all you need, too.
[6574.46 --> 6574.72]  Yeah.
[6575.02 --> 6577.14]  Like just somebody who's like, I've been through this before.
[6577.42 --> 6577.64]  Yeah.
[6577.70 --> 6578.38]  It's going to be okay.
[6578.64 --> 6578.78]  Yeah.
[6578.78 --> 6580.60]  Let's take these steps and we'll work our way out of it.
[6581.60 --> 6582.72]  But yeah, it's cool.
[6583.02 --> 6583.38]  Excited.
[6583.68 --> 6583.90]  Yeah.
[6584.00 --> 6585.34]  So we'll be switching over to them.
[6585.34 --> 6587.16]  And we're pretty excited about that.
[6587.46 --> 6587.58]  Yeah.
[6587.58 --> 6589.58]  Yeah.
[6589.58 --> 6592.00]  I got a couple quick things from the float plane chat here.
[6592.50 --> 6596.16]  Neomorph says, hey, please tell me you know when the LTT store sale ends.
[6596.16 --> 6602.96]  and then in response i'm going to give you this uh message from jetpack dan in the chat
[6602.96 --> 6610.36]  no the tech vest in my size is out of stock it doesn't matter how long the sale event lasts if
[6610.36 --> 6613.92]  you see something you like you should probably order it because this is the write-off sale
[6613.92 --> 6619.86]  and quantities are going to be limited regardless of how long the sale event lasts so you should
[6619.86 --> 6623.32]  probably move pretty quickly yeah i don't think we're going into back ordering for this stuff
[6623.32 --> 6630.44]  right it's just when it's sold out it's sold out uh these address the
[6631.32 --> 6641.08]  what i mean we're not going to play a video yeah that's not going to happen four hours ago sorry
[6641.08 --> 6648.74]  that's not going to be a thing um uh apparently we may or may not have said things incorrectly
[6648.74 --> 6654.58]  about placebos on the last show there's a video um from somebody about it uh feel free to check it
[6654.58 --> 6659.20]  out if you want we're not we don't really talk about medical stuff so i'm sure if we said it wrong
[6659.20 --> 6666.58]  it's our bad we're a tech channel it is what it is cool all right what else we got today
[6666.58 --> 6676.62]  do a new topic sure sick uh okay do you want good news or bad news
[6676.62 --> 6684.80]  good news okay eight sleep engineers backdoored your bed oh wait no that's not good news
[6684.80 --> 6690.76]  uh wait hold on wait backdoored it might be good news microsoft is shutting down skype for good
[6690.76 --> 6698.20]  i mean that that's probably neutral let's go with neutral okay uh microsoft has confirmed that after
[6698.20 --> 6705.20]  21 years skype is shutting down for good this confirmation comes after users poked around the
[6705.20 --> 6710.24]  latest skype preview update and notice text that read starting in may skype will no longer be
[6710.24 --> 6718.88]  available continue your calls and chats in teams or discord you know some skype users will already
[6718.88 --> 6722.50]  be able to log into teams using their skype credentials while others should gain the ability
[6722.50 --> 6728.16]  over the next few days our discussion question here is any good skype memories
[6728.16 --> 6739.42]  the ltt forum mod team used to meet over skype and that was cool it was pretty great it was pretty
[6739.42 --> 6745.48]  great for a little while until the ip resolver bug yes basically made it unusable for us because we would
[6745.48 --> 6752.24]  have people call into the wan show and then i forget the exact details but i think anyone who had the
[6752.24 --> 6761.52]  username of anyone in the call could resolve the ip address of the host of the call and so the wan show
[6761.52 --> 6767.68]  would just constantly get ddossed yeah whenever we would try to have a live guest which was basically
[6767.68 --> 6775.68]  why we stopped doing live guests for a long time we eventually figured out some mitigation that we will
[6775.68 --> 6785.44]  never ever ever talk about um but yeah skype any good experience i ever had with skype you know whether
[6785.44 --> 6792.32]  it was affordable long distance calling or you know using it as a reasonably high fidelity gaming chat
[6792.32 --> 6798.56]  uh was more than any good will that i had towards skype was more than wiped out by not just the existence of
[6798.56 --> 6810.88]  the ip resolver bug but the um long long long term persistence of the ip resolver bug it was a huge huge issue
[6812.40 --> 6820.64]  so yeah it sucked um goodbye skype um i wish that you were never introduced in place of msn messenger
[6820.64 --> 6827.12]  yeah rest in pieces yeah what else we got should we talk about the bed thing sure
[6828.56 --> 6834.80]  after discovering an aws key pair in a firmware update for his eight sleep mattress in december
[6834.80 --> 6842.80]  cyber security researcher dylan a ray did i sure dylan did some more digging and discovered that eight
[6842.80 --> 6850.72]  sleep engineers are able to remotely ssh into every customer's bed which by the way contains a full
[6850.72 --> 6858.00]  linux computer and they can even run arbitrary code and not just from your local network so cool
[6858.00 --> 6864.56]  dylan posted screenshots and code snippets on his truffle security blog and noted that with this access
[6865.12 --> 6871.04]  eight sleep engineers could know when you are sleeping detect how many people are in your bed
[6872.56 --> 6879.92]  change your bed's temperature change vibration and alarm settings connect to other devices on your local
[6879.92 --> 6888.64]  network and this is the kicker do literally anything that they could on a normal linux machine
[6891.84 --> 6897.44]  i'm really glad we don't work with them anymore yeah they have turned out to be absolute massive
[6897.44 --> 6906.00]  but doom cups um was it you who posted the that nine sleep thing yeah in the in the chat yeah apparently
[6906.00 --> 6914.16]  there's has it been abandoned uh it looks like maybe there's like a diy like like hack thing where you go
[6914.16 --> 6919.76]  and you take the micro sd card out of your eight sleep pod and you can like overwrite a file and then
[6919.76 --> 6924.08]  uh like manually configure it and stuff like there's no reason you shouldn't be able to do everything that
[6924.08 --> 6928.72]  eight street eight sleep does through the cloud locally other than just that they want to maintain
[6928.72 --> 6935.12]  control over the ecosystem i have one you can use it to tie into home assistant and stuff luke has one
[6935.92 --> 6944.64]  like begrudgingly have one i like mine they seem to make monster money so maybe no they don't they don't
[6944.64 --> 6950.24]  no they were in like financial trouble a while back oh really yeah oh well um maybe it's because
[6950.24 --> 6958.24]  they're shipping everybody linux computers maybe they should bomb down their product i could be wrong
[6959.12 --> 6964.32]  uh eight sleep has raised 86 million in series c funding hold on what's this one was this
[6964.88 --> 6972.48]  i just like i want someone to come up with a competitor february 2023 um okay i don't know
[6973.12 --> 6976.88]  i take that back i take that back maybe i'm wrong about that but um
[6976.88 --> 6985.28]  um addressed a leakage issue i missed the eighth sleep uh they've raised over 155 oh their latest
[6985.28 --> 6994.08]  funding round was a corporate minority on june 24th 2024 i don't know what that means no idea
[6995.20 --> 7000.08]  valuation was about half a bill in july yeah people are saying lots of embedded devices have embedded
[7000.08 --> 7006.72]  linux for some reason yeah i mean that is true but sure fair enough don't have a ssh backdoor into my
[7006.72 --> 7013.52]  house yeah yeah that that thing that he said just now so yeah i'm not uh not super into it our
[7013.52 --> 7021.04]  discussion question is is it time for diy water cooled bed version two oh man i don't want to can
[7021.04 --> 7029.44]  you buy a cover yeah you can you can buy it by just a cover oh uh like that's water cooled that i don't
[7029.44 --> 7034.40]  know but like in terms of like duvets you can get no no no no no like the the eight sleep cover it's called
[7034.40 --> 7040.48]  the cover yeah the part that straps onto your bed not the pod oh i i don't know that's a good
[7040.48 --> 7044.80]  question because the if i remember correctly when you guys made that video the difficult part was the
[7044.80 --> 7051.76]  cover uh no the bed was hard the cooling was hot well the cooling was only easy because we had that
[7051.76 --> 7056.64]  chiller that we just happened to have most people wouldn't have that but realistically you don't need
[7056.64 --> 7060.80]  that kind of horsepower in your trip not literal horsepower but you don't need that powerful of a
[7060.80 --> 7068.72]  chiller anyway um and something more akin to uh what we made when we did the water cooled gamer chair
[7068.72 --> 7075.04]  would be more than fine because like a couple hundred watts is lots to draw heat away from a
[7075.04 --> 7081.04]  sleeping person uh let me see if i can find it water cooled chair yeah here it is oh apparently there is
[7081.04 --> 7090.08]  a competitor i've never heard of this oh my god i will come back to this once my ads are done
[7092.08 --> 7098.00]  i know nothing about these guys they might have the exact same problem i have no clue but uh chili pad
[7099.52 --> 7104.72]  okay sleep me so i got a grammarly ad grammarly is one of those companies that like
[7104.72 --> 7109.76]  i would never use for myself but i absolutely believe that a lot of people should use
[7111.92 --> 7119.76]  uh yeah so here this um this just little like peltier element that i'm holding is is enough to
[7119.76 --> 7124.56]  cool one person and that's basically what's inside the eight sleep and then it just say i thought it
[7124.56 --> 7128.56]  was kind of it either runs to the hot side or the cold side depending on whether it's trying to chill
[7128.56 --> 7133.76]  the mattress cover or heat it and that's why it's so quiet too but it's not very energy efficient but
[7133.76 --> 7137.68]  because you're not actually trying to cool a computer with it it's fine you're just trying
[7137.68 --> 7142.56]  to cool a human which is like i think about 100 watts um at rest or something like that it's not
[7142.56 --> 7151.20]  it's not that much uh anyway not cool uh how's this competitor look i'm on your screen um when they
[7151.20 --> 7158.24]  were showing this animation i thought it was just like a a cool pad but then you can see um as the
[7158.24 --> 7162.96]  animation goes on it's kind of pivoting away from it now oh do you need one for each side interesting
[7162.96 --> 7167.04]  so they they show the cover coming down and they show a little blue animation of like look it's
[7167.04 --> 7173.52]  plugged into this thing oh yeah okay um so there is some form of external heat cool element but then i
[7173.52 --> 7180.88]  also see one on the other side uh so maybe it's one for each half the bed honestly is probably fine i
[7180.88 --> 7186.24]  mean probably fine realistically any like main bedroom layout is gonna have a spot for two nightstands and
[7186.24 --> 7193.12]  you know like it's gonna have two sides of the bed yeah generally speaking oh yeah here we go looks
[7193.12 --> 7200.16]  like these are their options doc pro but yeah so it comes with uh with two of the things supreme sleep
[7200.16 --> 7203.28]  track does that is it a subscription i don't know
[7203.28 --> 7214.56]  me half queen me or we uh sleep week sale is it a subscription does anybody know
[7217.52 --> 7223.84]  yeah so yeah the price jumps a bunch when you go to two people that makes sense which does make sense
[7224.64 --> 7231.36]  but i don't see any subscription things they have a protection plan but that's not a subscription yes it
[7231.36 --> 7237.44]  has a six dollar monthly subscription one month of sleep me plus yeah i see it now but does it work
[7237.44 --> 7242.08]  without it because i don't have an eight sleep subscription yeah you don't like enough for me yeah me too
[7246.56 --> 7249.36]  all right well realistically it's probably not gonna be
[7251.36 --> 7257.52]  that different but who knows maybe it is pretty similar but i don't know it's a subscription but you
[7257.52 --> 7263.92]  don't need it says someone says low boom so kind of same deal i guess okay all right what else we want
[7263.92 --> 7272.72]  to talk about today twitch has implemented a 100 hour storage limit and people are losing their minds
[7273.52 --> 7280.88]  in an effort to cut costs amazon-owned frenemy of streamers twitch is culling archived content by making
[7280.88 --> 7288.08]  all highlights and uploads whether published or unpublished count toward a single 100 hour storage
[7288.08 --> 7294.72]  limit this limit will go into place on april 19th when content will automatically be deleted until it
[7294.72 --> 7302.16]  falls below the limit this limit won't apply to full vods or clips only highlights and uploads from
[7302.16 --> 7307.68]  third-party services but some creators are sharing screenshots showing they have several thousands of
[7307.68 --> 7314.48]  hours in highlights alone and now have less than two months to archive them fka socks pointed out
[7314.48 --> 7320.88]  on the twitch forums that speed runners will likely be the worst hit speedrun history is stored entirely
[7320.88 --> 7325.12]  in highlights not just world records but most every run submitted that was on twitch is stored as a
[7325.12 --> 7334.16]  highlight on speedrun.com they said discussion question how expensive is hosting up to 4 000 plus hours
[7334.16 --> 7339.44]  a video for 0.5 percent of twitch streamers which is the percentage of twitch streamers that twitch claims
[7339.44 --> 7348.24]  will be effective and the answer is very expensive which is why amazon is stepping in and doing something
[7348.24 --> 7353.36]  about this and this is something that luke and i have talked about for a long time the most difficult
[7353.36 --> 7362.08]  part of twitch of pitching floatplane to creators is that floatplane costs what streaming and data storage
[7362.08 --> 7371.44]  cost everyone else is the vc model which is i i provide everything to you for free and we'll figure
[7371.44 --> 7380.56]  out the financials later and what that looks like is you know when sites like patreon um start oh they
[7380.56 --> 7386.72]  worked with vimeo with their yeah when uh sites like patreon that like you know had a video solution just
[7386.72 --> 7392.72]  like uh don't have a proper video solution anymore i believe they do now yep they do now but that was a
[7392.72 --> 7398.16]  big surprise to everybody uh when sites like twitch go hey unlimited data storage this doesn't make any
[7398.16 --> 7406.56]  sense and they just turn it off uh that's what happens and that's one of the reasons that i've talked
[7406.56 --> 7412.32]  about this at length in the past but that's one of the reasons that youtube is such a remarkable
[7412.32 --> 7418.48]  platform the reason that the the fact that they allow everyone to upload and the fact that all they
[7418.48 --> 7425.20]  ask in return is that you watch the ads which admittedly are a lot these days or that you pay a
[7425.20 --> 7431.36]  premium subscription which quite frankly given that it includes youtube music is very reasonably priced
[7431.36 --> 7436.88]  is kind of incredible uh youtube is flipping incredible and i don't know how long it's going to last
[7436.88 --> 7444.48]  uh but anyway back to back to twitch um i don't see them reversing course on this uh because realistically
[7444.48 --> 7449.84]  i don't think they care i think the only place that they're going to potentially lose streamers to
[7449.84 --> 7456.64]  is going to be what like kick and from my understanding kicks infrastructure just runs on aws anyway yeah but
[7456.64 --> 7461.44]  sometimes has like better features which is really funny so like what does amazon care because they
[7461.44 --> 7466.72]  basically get your business either way so they can just either bleed money themselves on twitch
[7466.72 --> 7471.68]  or they can just like take money from crypto bros apparently someone in full plane chat posted that
[7471.68 --> 7477.28]  apparently facebook is removing live vods that are over 30 days old yeah that doesn't surprise me
[7478.16 --> 7483.28]  it doesn't surprise me because none of this is sustainable yeah like that's the thing streaming is
[7483.28 --> 7491.92]  a crazy model like it's actually wild float plane is built to be sustainable and it is priced to be
[7491.92 --> 7498.88]  sustainable and we're doing all right and we're doing fine but this other stuff is built for explosive
[7498.88 --> 7506.00]  exponential growth and just like suck money up from vcs until it doesn't make sense anymore and then
[7507.20 --> 7512.48]  stall right like that's the thing if you take a plane and you go like this with it eventually it stalls out
[7512.48 --> 7519.76]  um whereas we're kind of built for slow slow steady growth very slow
[7519.76 --> 7527.36]  it's okay glacial you'll do that you'll do the business side someday someday someday you'll have an
[7527.36 --> 7535.36]  actual ceo it'll happen not just a ceo in name i'm not maybe never like the dog waiting outside of the store
[7539.68 --> 7545.20]  he'll come back someday except the store that i went to is uh for cigarettes so
[7545.20 --> 7547.20]  so
[7547.68 --> 7549.36]  dad's never coming home is he
[7551.60 --> 7558.64]  um honestly this feels like this feels like an opportunity for someone like um investment disclosure
[7559.20 --> 7569.04]  hashtag like right now would be it's too bad that they weren't like out of beta you know at this point with hex os
[7569.04 --> 7575.28]  uh because if they could just be like yeah okay twitch twitch streamers here get ready to own your
[7575.28 --> 7580.88]  data it's going to cost you a little bit of money because like duh storage costs money and you have to
[7580.88 --> 7585.28]  pay for it somehow but it's going to cost you a little bit of money but here's where you can put it
[7585.28 --> 7590.24]  i don't think most streamers are going to perma store their data they might perma store clips or
[7590.24 --> 7594.16]  specific streams or things like that but i don't think they're going to perma store everything
[7595.12 --> 7599.20]  sure but i mean we're not talking about everything it's not like twitch isn't willing to store a
[7599.20 --> 7602.88]  hundred hours worth of storage but if there's anything that they want outside of that then
[7602.88 --> 7608.40]  they're going to have to figure it out and some streamers will i remember severus yeah he used to
[7608.40 --> 7610.16]  yep and everything that's true
[7612.80 --> 7617.52]  well good luck everybody yep what else we got
[7619.68 --> 7621.68]  uh
[7624.16 --> 7631.20]  yeah i uh so much stuff likes orange said 10 plus years ago twitch stored the vaude of every stream
[7631.20 --> 7635.36]  ever then they took that away this is just a natural progression of that yeah it just doesn't make
[7635.36 --> 7642.40]  it doesn't make any sense especially when no offense twitch streamers but the vast majority of your air
[7642.40 --> 7650.08]  time is just garbage chair stream like it actually should not be archived it doesn't matter we don't need
[7650.08 --> 7656.24]  it what no you don't need to watch one person watching someone else's content no what do you
[7656.24 --> 7660.96]  mean i don't even need to watch two people watching someone else's content which streamers do if like
[7660.96 --> 7668.64]  youtube didn't exist uh play video games what i i i know i know that's tough wild idea that's hard work
[7668.64 --> 7675.36]  wild idea what that um nurdle says me watching two people talking about people watching content
[7675.36 --> 7687.04]  touché that's pretty good hey good news ea releases the source code for four command and
[7687.04 --> 7697.12]  conquer get was this on anyone's bingo card for 2025 not even a little yeah ea next you're gonna tell me
[7697.12 --> 7703.84]  like activision blizzard did something good no i'm kidding no one's gonna say that no the source code
[7703.84 --> 7712.00]  release is for command and conquer tiberian dawn red alert renegade and generals along with the zero
[7712.00 --> 7718.72]  hour expansion it is being released under the gpl license and the code is available from ea's freaking
[7718.72 --> 7725.68]  github page steam workshop support is also being enabled for renegade generals plus the zero hour
[7725.68 --> 7730.96]  expansion command and conquer 3 tiberium wars plus the kane's wrath expansion and command and conquer
[7730.96 --> 7737.44]  4 tiberium twilight they have released a modding support pack that includes source xml schema shader
[7737.44 --> 7744.16]  and map files for all games utilizing sage strategy action game engine also available from ea's github page
[7745.44 --> 7745.76]  what
[7748.48 --> 7755.44]  genuinely wild are you kidding me ea released remasters of command and conquer tiberian dawn
[7755.68 --> 7761.68]  og and red alert back in 2020 as well as the ultimate collection in 2024 on steam but this is
[7761.68 --> 7768.16]  this is wild ferna 182 says it's ea there will be a catch mark my words there will be a catch but i i
[7768.16 --> 7772.48]  don't i don't see the catch i never got into command and conquer i was a warcraft kid
[7773.04 --> 7778.00]  i like that red alert was was big in my house but like dude this is this is
[7778.00 --> 7786.48]  i i am at a loss it's weird like we had valve last week going full good guy on tf2 and how did
[7786.48 --> 7791.60]  these happen so close to each other i know it's really hard for me to believe that ea was able to like
[7792.40 --> 7798.56]  do this in a week you know there's no way so they must have both been cooking on it but like
[7798.56 --> 7806.80]  what that's just so weird thanks mukem i want the luxe backpack i will pay double also this money
[7806.80 --> 7812.32]  could have went toward tinting my golf i don't know if we're gonna bring the luxe bag back but
[7812.32 --> 7814.24]  hey thanks for her i'm picking up a backpack
[7816.56 --> 7821.36]  i i i i i mean we've said everything there is to say about the topic at this point i think other
[7821.36 --> 7828.32]  than just i want to drag it out a little bit more to emphasize good job ea like this sweet this
[7828.32 --> 7836.08]  is the best case scenario yeah for game preservation this is the best case possible scenario for
[7836.08 --> 7844.08]  preserving gaming experiences for future generations like what was it um i think it was destiny uh destiny
[7844.08 --> 7851.20]  2 i was looking at uh that that lawsuit uh destiny 2 lawsuit youtube footage uh because they
[7851.20 --> 7859.04]  were trying to here we go yeah bungie's lawyers had to use fan videos of old destiny 2 content in
[7859.04 --> 7866.80]  court because it doesn't exist in game anymore freaking wild so this is uh because a science
[7866.80 --> 7872.00]  fiction writer is is suing them but the so the lawyers can't point at the game anymore because
[7872.00 --> 7877.28]  these live service games change over time and these gaming experiences are just gone
[7877.28 --> 7888.40]  that sucks yeah and i didn't expect ea of all companies to be one of the first
[7889.36 --> 7897.68]  to do this in a big fashion i'm i'm a hundred freaking conquer like this isn't like some crap
[7897.68 --> 7902.56]  game no one ever cared about yeah command and conquer was a huge deal red alert was a huge deal
[7902.56 --> 7907.12]  no kidding both of these were were massive i mean i think it's command and conquer red alert but
[7907.12 --> 7914.96]  whatever uh red alert one and red alert two were both massive um i don't know it's cool i just i
[7916.08 --> 7922.32]  i respect it it's good good it's rare see radon man he wasn't gonna say anything anyway
[7923.12 --> 7927.12]  they're like he's like let luke talk no i had nothing to add yeah it's really cool
[7927.92 --> 7933.44]  it's just good someone said it did it first yeah i mean i didn't know that to be completely honest
[7933.44 --> 7938.48]  but maybe i knew it at one point forgot i'm not sure but it's just i'm still very happy
[7940.32 --> 7949.44]  ah in less good gaming news warner bros cannot break their l streak and has shut down legendary game
[7949.44 --> 7956.24]  studio monolith productions alongside two others and this one hits me a little harder
[7956.24 --> 7965.68]  than most because i don't know if you guys remember this but um we actually got an incredible
[7965.68 --> 7972.32]  opportunity seven years ago to go behind the scenes at monolith that is a terrible thumbnail
[7972.32 --> 7979.76]  now not enough people watched this this was a really good video the folks there were so cool they were
[7979.76 --> 7987.84]  awesome so dedicated to their craft um i i just i don't think i've ever seen a more passionate team
[7987.84 --> 7992.88]  doing more passionate stuff this was sponsored by xbox and this was the one time we ever did a
[7992.88 --> 7999.12]  sponsorship with xbox and it was so worth it and so cool let's go to their mocap they had an on
[7999.12 --> 8005.36]  site it was so sick they had an on-site mocap setup where the actual developers like some of them had a
[8005.36 --> 8010.32]  little bit of martial arts training and they would they would like have an idea for something and they
[8010.32 --> 8016.64]  would literally just go jump in the mocap room and and and just do it and then go back to their stations
[8016.64 --> 8020.40]  and and and work on it like it was oh
[8023.36 --> 8029.12]  what an absolutely incredible team they did some incredible work um
[8029.12 --> 8037.68]  um uh shadow of mordor was actually one of the only games during that time of my life
[8037.68 --> 8042.88]  uh that i managed to play all the way through because i was really busy like running a company
[8042.88 --> 8048.00]  and having kids and stuff uh middle earth shadow of mordor for what they came out in 2014 that was like
[8048.00 --> 8055.36]  that was like the empty times for gaming for me i played through uh the first tomb raider like like
[8055.36 --> 8061.52]  reboot i played through middle earth shadow of mordor i don't know maybe like one or two other
[8061.52 --> 8067.60]  games absolutely incredible game the nemesis system was so cool so sick um literally it was
[8067.60 --> 8074.00]  literally just messing around with the nemesis system was like worthy gameplay oh a hundred percent
[8074.00 --> 8084.88]  so for those of you not familiar it basically created memorable characters out of like just rando npc enemies
[8084.88 --> 8090.16]  and like created like like feuds between you and even between them and each other and stuff the
[8090.16 --> 8094.00]  nemesis system was super cool it made it so that deaths in the game like if you died
[8095.12 --> 8103.20]  the your nemesis would like level up and evolve so like your own death was a was an actual mechanic
[8103.20 --> 8111.52]  in the game which is so cool like i i don't know though it was it was sick anyway this sucks um let's
[8111.52 --> 8117.12]  read through the thing monolith has had struggled under the close scrutiny of warner brothers after
[8117.12 --> 8122.48]  the second middle earth shadow game made less money than the first the bros were only really
[8122.48 --> 8129.28]  interested in established franchises at that point so the new ip code named legacy was cancelled in 2021
[8129.28 --> 8136.16]  and most of the studio leadership left once work on the troubled wonder woman began uh david added a note
[8136.16 --> 8141.52]  here they formed cliffhanger games at ea and are making the new black panther game oh cool
[8142.64 --> 8148.80]  after the historic 200 million dollar flop of suicide squad killed the justice league as well as the
[8148.80 --> 8154.64]  100 million dollar write down of multi versus and the new quidditch game warner brothers has cancelled
[8154.64 --> 8160.56]  wonder woman and closed monolith as well as player first games multi versus and wb games san diego
[8160.56 --> 8167.84]  which was working on an unannounced free to play triple a game the incredible but unfortunately patented
[8167.84 --> 8174.32]  nemesis system from the shadow games will now live in legal limbo instead of being iterated on by monolith
[8174.32 --> 8183.76]  or other developers um okay so yeah that blows basically i don't really know what else there is to say about
[8183.76 --> 8193.92]  that either yeah hall effect is dead long live tmr 8-bit dough is releasing the ultimate 2 non-c
[8193.92 --> 8201.28]  wireless controller and they have ditched hall effect sticks in favor of a new text a new stick tech tmr or
[8201.28 --> 8208.16]  tunneling magneto resistance tmr can offer higher precision reportedly 10 times over hall effect and
[8208.16 --> 8215.68]  refresh rates up to 20 000 hertz while using less power from gilly kit ceo jack he via the verge the
[8215.68 --> 8221.04]  power consumption of tmr sensors is usually in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 milliamps while hall effect
[8221.04 --> 8226.88]  sensors consume can consume 0.5 to 2 milliamps mainly because of this difference hall effect
[8226.88 --> 8232.56]  joysticks cannot work very well when installed on stock controllers there are already several other
[8232.56 --> 8237.20]  controllers currently available with tmr sticks including the excellent game sir cyclone 2 which david
[8237.20 --> 8243.76]  unboxed recently on sc people love that dude third party controllers are not little brother anymore
[8243.76 --> 8250.32]  no that controller roundup that we do that that controller roundup we did opened my eyes in a big
[8250.32 --> 8259.36]  way i just had not i have not given enough attention to it controller enjoyer for a very long time and that
[8259.36 --> 8265.60]  game sir cyclone 2 video from david has made me like consider buying not an xbox controller for like
[8265.60 --> 8272.08]  literally potentially the first time ever this video was a ton of fun to make and there's just
[8272.08 --> 8276.48]  because something didn't win the bracket doesn't there are the bracket the tournament doesn't mean
[8276.48 --> 8282.48]  that it wasn't really an incredible controller uh there's a lot of diamonds out there uh some of them
[8282.48 --> 8288.00]  in the rough some of them hiding in plain sight i i i was blown away i was blown away the community really
[8288.00 --> 8293.20]  was right on this one because they they called us out they were like you guys have not paid attention to
[8293.20 --> 8298.24]  like controller reddit and we're like okay all right all right we're on it we're on it and man they were
[8298.24 --> 8310.40]  they were right very cool uh what else we got today um do you want to talk about uh developer
[8310.40 --> 8321.04]  reese kentish who built an app that stops people from doom scrolling by making them touch grass this
[8321.92 --> 8323.52]  is awesome
[8325.76 --> 8333.92]  to unlock your phone touch grass you have to it opens the camera and you literally have to go outside
[8333.92 --> 8338.08]  stop doom scrolling and touch actual grass grass detected
[8340.88 --> 8347.36]  that is awesome and i love it that's all i have to say about that no maybe there's more to say about
[8347.36 --> 8352.16]  that yeah it uses computer vision to detect the grass this is getting significantly easier this is
[8352.16 --> 8358.96]  there's this thing wendell told me like eons ago at this point um that everything becomes like in the
[8358.96 --> 8362.88]  software development world everything becomes three times easier to make every three years
[8363.68 --> 8370.40]  and there was like reasoning why it's not you know two times every two years it's it's like anyways um
[8370.96 --> 8377.52]  and these types of things are just so much easier to make these days there's another app out there um
[8380.56 --> 8382.24]  app time let me see if i can find it
[8388.48 --> 8392.48]  i don't know if we can be able to find it right now but there's another app out there where you have to
[8392.48 --> 8396.40]  put your phone in front of you and then it kind of like maps out your your structure and you have to
[8396.40 --> 8406.16]  do push-ups um in order to like effectively buy app time um so you can use apps um i i i think you could
[8406.16 --> 8415.12]  potentially combine a few of these things i think um there's there's been a surge in popularity for
[8415.12 --> 8422.40]  things like dumb phones there's also been a surge in popularity of uh blocking app time and different
[8422.40 --> 8430.48]  things to just like help aid your willpower in using your phone um did handyman just find it he might
[8430.48 --> 8434.40]  uh
[8434.40 --> 8441.76]  this is not the one i was looking for but yeah it clearly there's a few of these types of things this
[8441.76 --> 8447.92]  is not an original idea uh maybe the actual touching grass portion is but um putting barriers
[8447.92 --> 8453.36]  in a variety of different types of barriers in front of using apps is like absolutely a thing that i think caters to
[8453.36 --> 8460.80]  um younger phone users yeah i mean i think everyone's probably had the idea of like man gaming's not even
[8460.80 --> 8465.68]  that unhealthy if i like get up and do some push-ups during every loading screen yep and that lasts for
[8465.68 --> 8472.80]  like the first quarter of one gaming session because it doesn't you're not forced to do it yes if the
[8472.80 --> 8478.64]  webcam on your computer like wouldn't allow you to click next match i think we've talked about that
[8478.64 --> 8484.72]  probably i think we've actually talked about that as like a like a like a a product that could exist
[8485.60 --> 8490.48]  like uh uh yeah that must have been on wan show at some point i would man there's so many
[8490.48 --> 8496.08]  wan shows and there's so many hours of wan shows so many hours it's amazing that anyone is willing to
[8496.08 --> 8501.60]  archive all the hours of i mean not very well because they're like half of them are corrupt but this
[8501.60 --> 8508.00]  is true you know it is what it is um but yeah i think things like this are fantastic so that's very
[8508.00 --> 8513.28]  very cool good job keep going less fantastic is that plex is killing the watch together feature
[8513.28 --> 8516.72]  they've been rewriting their apps from the ground up over the last couple years and have made the
[8516.72 --> 8522.64]  decision to remove watch together it will continue to exist in the web app for the foreseeable future
[8522.64 --> 8528.56]  and was um this did not go over well with their community watch together initially launched in may of
[8528.56 --> 8533.84]  2020 during the coveted pandemic it synchronizes the video stream for the group pausing for everyone if an
[8533.84 --> 8539.20]  individual pauses playback and resuming for everyone at the same time they don't preclude the
[8539.20 --> 8544.00]  possibility of offering similar functionality again in the future using new tooling but it's gone for
[8544.00 --> 8551.60]  now and it's just yet another string of elves from the plex team removing features that used to exist
[8551.60 --> 8557.12]  and that people you know paid for their software with the understanding that it would have it
[8557.12 --> 8563.04]  um a big frustrating one for me is how broken downloads still are i ran into a bug recently on android
[8563.04 --> 8570.08]  where i tried to or was it on ios i think it was uh i don't remember anyway i tried for a recent trip
[8570.08 --> 8576.48]  to down to disneyland i tried to load a season of a show onto ivan's phone so it was on android and uh
[8577.12 --> 8583.28]  two of the episodes errored and when you don't click the individual episodes when you click an entire
[8583.28 --> 8590.80]  season there is no way in the interface to retry one of them so i had to remove the entire season and
[8590.80 --> 8595.68]  then re-download the entire season which then also failed so it was just complete waste of my time
[8595.68 --> 8603.04]  that's annoying yeah like plex says it's really complicated doing like downloads especially
[8603.04 --> 8610.96]  background downloads which i i kind of get but also like oh my god then don't do background downloads
[8610.96 --> 8618.88]  and force me to keep the app do something oh i see download a file download a file to a full that
[8618.88 --> 8628.32]  can't be impossible i'm sorry i don't i don't buy it um i don't buy it i'm sorry download a file cannot
[8628.32 --> 8638.24]  be that hard retry on download as well shouldn't be a big deal no it really shouldn't i wonder if part
[8638.24 --> 8644.24]  of the problem is that they try to transcode and download like mid like fine to finish the transcode
[8644.24 --> 8654.96]  first and then i don't care but just download a file can't be that hard um i mean even then you
[8654.96 --> 8662.88]  should be able to retry it this is cool psionic launches a new advanced ability hand for humans and
[8662.88 --> 8670.16]  robots they just launched their improved mark nine and a half ability hand it's available for both humans
[8670.16 --> 8676.96]  for use as a prosthetic and for robots and features the first touch sensing bionics with the ability
[8676.96 --> 8684.32]  to read and control 30 touch sensor values and send a vibration to the user's arm to communicate the
[8684.32 --> 8692.00]  sensation it is blunt force impact and water resistant and will have 32 grip patterns currently 19.
[8692.00 --> 8700.56]  okay let's uh have a look at this the video is pretty cool yeah oh okay never mind this is cute
[8702.40 --> 8709.84]  sorry where's the uh where's the video uh this is the the second link ah yes cool i've got it up
[8709.84 --> 8713.36]  actually just switched to uh too late blink no i got him
[8713.36 --> 8723.76]  like how they show the combination of people and also robots i think that's pretty neat
[8725.04 --> 8729.92]  they're trying to prove it's for both right oh wait i know why this is in the doc these guys sent
[8729.92 --> 8736.64]  me a video a while back of this uh uh this woman basically just like going throughout her day with one
[8736.64 --> 8742.08]  of their uh prosthetics and it like blew my mind that's how she was able to basically do
[8742.08 --> 8749.92]  like everything that's so sick um like obviously there's going to be a learning curve for something
[8749.92 --> 8755.28]  like this but yeah and you can tell like with something it doesn't it doesn't look like necessarily
[8755.84 --> 8761.60]  100 perfect but that guy just loaded a big plate onto a bar yeah that was her uh in that one where she
[8761.60 --> 8771.92]  was lifting the thing yeah um like clearly you can be extremely capable with this it looks like a
[8771.92 --> 8779.60]  lit a little more rigid than normal like human movement but yeah it's so sick super cool yeah i
[8779.60 --> 8786.56]  guess that's pretty much it for that it's a rapid fire topic fantastic um i guess i don't know i think
[8786.56 --> 8789.84]  that's pretty much it for this week should we switch over to after dark how you doing over there dan
[8789.84 --> 8797.36]  how's your uh how's your fingers doing um a little tender no a little tender or uh two oh my god 45 and
[8797.36 --> 8804.88]  so i'm doing one every 14 seconds okay wow a little ep good job everyone my eyes hurt um i should
[8804.88 --> 8811.60]  probably check the gross profit it's a lot it's a lot of profit is not a lot i promise you that much
[8811.60 --> 8818.96]  your off-site laptop bag call out as much as people did notice it um has caused it to surge in the
[8818.96 --> 8829.20]  rankings oh oh the surgeons driver is still dunking in terms of quantity amazing oh yeah it's a great
[8829.20 --> 8834.96]  pen scribe driver people and and the great thing about selling pens is people um need an unlimited
[8834.96 --> 8842.80]  number of them because they'll always lose them oh my god the uh oh no the the oh wait hold on oh yeah
[8842.80 --> 8847.84]  okay so scribe yes scribe driver is ahead but not by as much as you'd think looking at the dashboard
[8847.84 --> 8852.40]  not everybody sends a merge message no i know i know yeah and apparently a lot of people who
[8852.40 --> 8858.96]  ordered the laptop bag do not send a merge message so that's interesting so people who like writing with
[8858.96 --> 8866.88]  pens are more likely to send in a merch message that kind of maybe lines up yeah the mcm starter
[8866.88 --> 8872.00]  thing oh actually no we did sell a lot of those it's just really low on the list because it's uh not
[8872.00 --> 8880.40]  making money oh yeah uh hold on how do i have this sorted uh let me just see if uh yeah scribe
[8880.40 --> 8888.24]  driver purchasers might be yap enjoyers yeah that makes sense oh my god well anyway uh yeah good luck me
[8888.80 --> 8897.76]  so that's cool well it's good for cash flow anyway it's not good for profitability uh okay let's talk about
[8897.76 --> 8904.32]  some rich messages sure oh i forgot to set you over to the other one hi el and dan in your limit in
[8904.32 --> 8913.04]  opinion would the xreal one pro entered after dark uh from the fallon vid be usable as a work monitor
[8913.04 --> 8920.32]  i'm in a front-end dev and often need a screen where i can't have one thanks and hi l2
[8920.32 --> 8932.00]  oh i can multitask text um i mean it's 1080p right and it's 1080p at like you know 170 inches or 150
[8932.00 --> 8937.92]  inches or whatever you configure it to because you can sort of configure its virtual distance and virtual
[8937.92 --> 8947.52]  size but no matter how you slice it it's 1080p at an enormous size um it also doesn't have like it's not
[8947.52 --> 8957.04]  uh it's not an apple vision pro right so it doesn't have the same spatial awareness that an apple vision
[8957.04 --> 8962.72]  pro does so it's not able to like lock and hover as you you know move around you can't like set it up as
[8962.72 --> 8969.44]  a monitor and you know do your thing like it either floats around with you or it stays um i forget what
[8969.44 --> 8976.64]  the sorry i forget what the two modes are it either is like stationary like that or it uh i think it tries
[8976.64 --> 8982.32]  to i think it uses just like gyro to kind of float around with you so it was a big problem uh when i
[8982.32 --> 8988.24]  was on the plane for instance like taxiing on the runway the plane would turn it'd be like see you later
[8988.88 --> 8997.92]  um so it's a really cool product and really useful in certain situations but i don't think it's a monitor
[8997.92 --> 9007.44]  if it was between that and nothing maybe but i gotta feel like there's almost always gonna be
[9008.00 --> 9014.24]  a way to get a higher dpi display near you than those glasses what nothing just something good happened
[9015.60 --> 9020.80]  that's a first okay and you're not gonna like provide any context for that literally not at all
[9020.80 --> 9024.96]  what an actual dick i have to work with a guy all day
[9033.76 --> 9039.60]  all right what's next sure uh sorry you're gonna be a little more i mean i can say i guess wow i
[9039.60 --> 9046.24]  didn't think people were gonna react that much yeah uh a new contractor that is theoretically gonna
[9046.24 --> 9052.64]  help us work on the apps for flowplane just fully signed on oh wow very cool yeah okay that is good
[9052.64 --> 9057.68]  news that is good news i didn't like really want to say it because now one's gonna be like um it's
[9057.68 --> 9064.72]  next friday and i where's the app update so yeah i i'm already getting it's like never mind next friday
[9064.72 --> 9070.40]  where's the app update now what are you waiting for where's the apple tv update yeah where's the roku
[9070.40 --> 9076.24]  where's the picture in picture where's the dark mode this is like actually a big problem because
[9076.24 --> 9081.20]  we we literally discussed like one of the goals of bringing this person on and and they're just
[9081.20 --> 9085.60]  part-time whatever don't get too excited but one of the goals of bringing them on is to have a tv
[9085.60 --> 9092.64]  app finally come out but it's like where do you where do you draw the line like okay so we have a
[9092.64 --> 9097.68]  general purpose tv app but that doesn't work for roku so then you have to have a roku app but that
[9097.68 --> 9102.96]  doesn't work for this other thing so then you try to get that but then like there's no line you
[9102.96 --> 9111.84]  maintain everything no and you do it on zero dollar budget no you pay linus yeah less than zero dollar
[9111.84 --> 9119.60]  budget 10 bucks come on roku app 10 bucks yeah think of all the think of all the payment and exposure
[9119.60 --> 9124.40]  you're getting and experience is just iframe really okay i didn't even know that we haven't looked into
[9124.40 --> 9129.52]  it a lot um we're we're gonna do the general one first anyways we'll figure it out but that
[9129.52 --> 9133.76]  hopefully they're helpful it's they're basically just gonna be working like probably weekends and
[9133.76 --> 9139.84]  stuff so it's not anyways whatever fine doesn't matter but i'm excited it's good little said i was
[9139.84 --> 9146.08]  joking i'm sorry apparently it's not just iframe then oh but like i thought it was like their their
[9146.08 --> 9151.76]  own like language and junk but again i haven't i really haven't looked into it much um we're not doing
[9151.76 --> 9157.52]  tizen because i just don't feel like it samsung should just stop doing tizen and that is the real
[9157.52 --> 9164.72]  solution to that you're welcome samsung i'm i'm helping i'm doing my little part to put pressure on
[9164.72 --> 9171.60]  you to just abandon that hot pile of garbage to develop a roku app you primarily use the programming
[9171.60 --> 9178.64]  languages scene graph xml based for ui design and bright script for logic and interaction within the
[9178.64 --> 9183.28]  roku development environment requiring you to create a developer account and following roku's
[9183.28 --> 9186.64]  guidelines for designing coding packaging and publishing your app on the rookie store
[9189.20 --> 9194.32]  that's how it's terrible do that at all so this is what i mean by like where even their portal for
[9194.32 --> 9201.44]  publishing is awful haha what llm yeah yeah yeah yeah that was just the google search one um and i don't
[9201.44 --> 9206.64]  know considering that was an llm just spitting that out i don't know if that's 100 true etc etc i've just
[9206.64 --> 9214.40]  heard it's like kind of a huge pain um but we're we're working on it we'll get there hey y'all i'm
[9214.40 --> 9218.72]  getting the bolt action pen for my dad's birthday i wanted to ask linus what industries he think would
[9218.72 --> 9223.68]  be the most favorable for the emerging small businesses to be a part of over the next five years
[9224.80 --> 9233.20]  hmm uh do you want to uh just uh post your dissertation on the economy um dude i can't even begin to
[9233.20 --> 9242.40]  i'm thinking lentils dude i can't even be i like that reference i i i can't even begin to um
[9243.36 --> 9248.72]  to guess like the world is so messed up right like um
[9250.80 --> 9257.20]  you you've got the you've got stock market volatility at maybe not an all-time high but certainly rather
[9257.20 --> 9263.36]  extreme extremely high you've got these valuations on companies like whether we're talking you know
[9263.36 --> 9270.24]  tesla or truth social or nvidia you've got these valuations on companies that are make no sense at
[9270.24 --> 9278.64]  all utterly divorced from any kind of of profit earnings reality uh you've got you've got ebita
[9278.64 --> 9285.92]  anymore you've got gold that's you know gone up what what is it like 56 in the last year or something
[9285.92 --> 9291.12]  like that meanwhile you've got bitcoin that shot up over the last year and then has
[9291.84 --> 9297.36]  plunged over the last few days i i haven't actually looked at it today so i might be out of date
[9297.36 --> 9304.08]  right like uh bdc to us dollars where we at okay it's just says below 80k it's up one percent today but
[9304.08 --> 9310.08]  it's it's no it's 85 usd now i mean being up one percent is huge though that doesn't sound like much
[9310.08 --> 9318.64]  but in the in the current environment yeah um where is the safe haven right now uh i have no idea i mean
[9318.64 --> 9324.80]  i it's funny i i ask my kids like you know what do you want to be when you grow up and the the the
[9324.80 --> 9330.24]  hilarious part of me asking them that is no matter what they say i'm going to have absolutely no guidance
[9330.24 --> 9337.12]  to give them whatsoever because i don't know what kind of world they are going to participate in
[9337.12 --> 9343.12]  the workforce of um and and i've talked about that before on wan show you know 10 years ago i said the
[9343.12 --> 9349.20]  same thing except that here we are 10 years later where we're not talking that far in the future anymore
[9349.20 --> 9357.60]  and yet my level of clarity is no higher because volatility just keeps going up if anything it might be less
[9360.24 --> 9368.88]  you know what industries will be most favorable for emerging small businesses to be part of over
[9368.88 --> 9376.64]  the next five years okay well health care human care won't be going anywhere therapy um a lot of
[9376.64 --> 9384.40]  therapy yeah that's something um man i mean they're going to try to ai that too dog like they're already
[9384.40 --> 9390.80]  doing it as far as my understanding goes um not even if they are doing it people are going to seek
[9390.80 --> 9398.80]  it out through those like relational lms casper uh in float casper explorer in uh float plane chat says
[9398.80 --> 9404.72]  blue collar trades yeah i mean if you have the for sure if you have the the the energy and you have the
[9404.72 --> 9412.72]  strength for it and if you don't you should i get think try and find it um building stuff repairing stuff
[9412.72 --> 9418.72]  uh there's going to be there's going to be money to be made there there's going to be reliable work
[9418.72 --> 9426.80]  material harvesting for that matter mining forestry stuff like that the flesh of the weak underclass
[9426.80 --> 9431.44]  crystal i'm not saying machines they make a lot of money these days man
[9433.44 --> 9438.80]  um like actually though like you're not wrong but i'm not saying that crystal uh what else we got
[9442.72 --> 9449.28]  now i don't find it i like oh yep cif fellas says i mean working for the federal government has
[9449.28 --> 9454.96]  always been solid but the cracks are forming cracks brother cracks you say
[9458.32 --> 9463.68]  dude that's like looking at my ass and being like that's got a crack in it you know like that's a chasm
[9463.68 --> 9471.68]  i should have waited until i drank something what the heck
[9476.88 --> 9481.44]  don't worry just comb it with a brick all right that might be worse
[9484.32 --> 9492.48]  i think you just beat me i had that streak for like a decade i would never beat you
[9493.68 --> 9501.36]  i think you're gonna be a kid um oh man yeah human care oh dude yeah i think stuff like paid
[9501.36 --> 9507.68]  friend industry is going to make its way outside of like japan and stuff probably i would also say i
[9507.68 --> 9512.96]  mean you're talking about human care uh we have an extremely aging population yeah well that's that's a
[9512.96 --> 9525.28]  big part of it yeah okay what else we got they won't be for long uh with the way things are going
[9526.80 --> 9531.76]  hey day low question for luke how much for security risk is linus still using his note 9 a device still
[9531.76 --> 9537.20]  running android 10 and that hasn't received a security update for probably more than two years that's
[9537.20 --> 9543.28]  honestly the the least of the problems when it comes to that guy um no that's pretty high up there
[9543.28 --> 9548.24]  dude you just log in to your own accounts on random devices around the office and then just leave them
[9548.24 --> 9559.52]  there like what are you talking about oh like my steam account i mean it's locked locked by what you know by a lock
[9559.52 --> 9568.08]  do you have a custom password on there that one does yeah yeah it does yeah did you do that yes
[9568.64 --> 9575.52]  thank you there you go but this is this is what we already follow around in his wake and like try to
[9575.52 --> 9580.16]  solve the incredibly chaotic things that he leaves behind i've got work to do that is already
[9581.44 --> 9586.64]  you know you know he's gonna be a problem so why don't you just develop the systems that let him do
[9586.64 --> 9593.44]  whatever he wants this guy and i will say i don't know why i'm doing this but to defend him
[9594.08 --> 9600.24]  uh i love how he knew where i was going before i even said it this is extremely common practice for
[9601.12 --> 9610.72]  uh like company owners and stuff where the it team has to be like okay please stop no my time i'm busy my
[9610.72 --> 9618.40]  time is better spent doing literally anything else that's why i make a bunch of spreadsheets with the
[9618.40 --> 9623.76]  it's literally account stack he's not he's not wrong literally why a hundred other people work here
[9625.04 --> 9632.00]  is because they are doing stuff that i'm not doing including an it team i honestly one of our biggest
[9632.00 --> 9638.56]  problems is that he won't stop doing certain things um why what did i do like if you think about the the
[9638.56 --> 9645.76]  twitter one like if you just didn't do oh dude i i have learned hey look i have passed every one of
[9645.76 --> 9653.84]  your fishing tests with flying don't answer your email i do i do answer my emails what email did you
[9653.84 --> 9659.20]  send me that i haven't answered mr besser well that one actually i actually also missed that email
[9659.20 --> 9663.12]  because i checked my emails very infrequently at least recently oh you mean the email that i was
[9663.12 --> 9668.16]  supposed to do like a training session no the that one looks like a phishing email but the uh the
[9668.16 --> 9673.92]  actual some people reported the training session emails as phishing i would honestly probably it
[9673.92 --> 9679.76]  was bad it looked really sketchy yeah that's like this link to go to your security training that your
[9680.48 --> 9686.96]  definitely from sean but it's not from his email it's okay your company name here has we didn't set
[9686.96 --> 9696.08]  it up properly nice um yeah but the the like phishing test email you're not the one that opened yours
[9696.08 --> 9702.64]  what do you mean i'm not the one that opened it oh no the phishing test email the the like blind
[9702.64 --> 9706.64]  tests that we did when we tested the whole company without telling them yeah you're not the one that
[9706.64 --> 9711.92]  opened it i know yeah yeah that's because i just like so you never got before i even opened it
[9712.48 --> 9716.88]  well you didn't nuke it that hard what do you mean the other person opened it what other person
[9716.88 --> 9720.32]  what you nuked it before you opened it there was no hint that it was a phishing email in the subject
[9720.32 --> 9726.40]  line well yeah why not i don't think there was i oh man now i now i want to know what it was oh you
[9726.40 --> 9732.40]  mean that i can find it no no i i i can find it okay uh i think i remember a keyword from it
[9734.24 --> 9741.04]  oh man what was it uh you ever have that thing where there's someone that you can communicate with
[9741.04 --> 9746.48]  on multiple apps and sometimes you just like open so many different things trying to figure which
[9746.48 --> 9755.52]  freaking one it is yep that's why i only use i message now i'm an apple user oh my kid there's
[9755.52 --> 9764.56]  other message oh man i must have deleted it or something it's not it's not it literally is not in my
[9764.56 --> 9775.20]  inbox anymore i think i can i'm pretty sure basically it was it was an email that was asking me to
[9775.84 --> 9781.68]  like link up with someone on another platform that we use but that was like obviously fake
[9783.60 --> 9789.44]  i at least i think it was obviously fake the subject line said your teammates are trying to
[9789.44 --> 9794.48]  reach you exclamation mark oh yeah i would have just deleted that that's that is obvious that's
[9794.48 --> 9799.20]  super obvious yeah i'm pretty sure i did that on my phone i probably just hit report spam or something
[9799.20 --> 9806.32]  some from microsoft dot teams at microsoft dash office 365.com
[9808.32 --> 9812.40]  i get those emails from a different chat platform mic raf soft
[9812.96 --> 9817.84]  oh it had a spelling mistake on purpose there's a bunch of them no no that's that's good
[9818.80 --> 9823.92]  anyway it's good that we do these training exercises now because while i've definitely been on high
[9823.92 --> 9831.52]  alert ever since the twitter breach um not everyone is always on high alert and it's it's good to do
[9831.52 --> 9836.96]  these things as part of your ongoing training so we did one we did one that we like we didn't tell
[9836.96 --> 9845.20]  anyone that it was coming and then we have told everyone that they will be happening moving forward um
[9845.84 --> 9851.44]  because we wanted to see how many people would click on it and who yeah but then after that we just
[9851.44 --> 9856.40]  wanted people to be alert more than anything so if we just tell them there is more coming and actually
[9856.40 --> 9860.00]  do it yep um then they're going to be alert all the time because they don't want to click on it again
[9860.00 --> 9866.64]  which is great that is like the goal good job yeah good job team who clicked i ain't telling you oh yeah
[9866.64 --> 9875.84]  come on you guys you're not knowing no way that's happening wasn't me i'm not saying anything it wasn't
[9875.84 --> 9881.36]  me oh you're saying i thought you said was it me i was like you're on the team yes no no it was not
[9881.36 --> 9888.56]  me did you even have her in the shower that's a song reference right a weird shower
[9892.16 --> 9898.96]  yes look at there obviously okay dan can you give us another rich mess i'm i'm gonna do that
[9898.96 --> 9907.04]  hi lld.wan or w-a-n i can't remember which one you lambasted me for given how long y'all worked together
[9907.04 --> 9912.88]  at the seemingly close relationships that you have at lmg if you had to move on to a new job
[9912.88 --> 9919.28]  how hard would it be to get settled in with a new team also yacht yacht's dead um the mooring's not
[9919.28 --> 9924.88]  included in the sale and there's nowhere to moor it here so it's dead um as for man how hard would it
[9924.88 --> 9931.84]  be to get settled in with a new team i even have a hard time like getting to know new people here these
[9931.84 --> 9937.12]  days compared to the early days because in the early days i like had to i was directly exposed to
[9937.12 --> 9947.60]  every single person on the team every day not stop we have hr now but she's uh i had direct contact with
[9947.60 --> 9959.52]  every me keep going you'll get it i worked directly there you go yeah i bet you were with every member
[9964.40 --> 9972.80]  you do it on purpose now prove it wasn't always on purpose fair enough um
[9972.80 --> 9981.60]  um and and like and i had to right so so there was no there was no choice whereas now um i have to go
[9981.60 --> 9986.48]  it's it's like the opposite it's the complete opposite i have to go way out of my way to interact
[9986.48 --> 9993.12]  with a lot of people on the team like to the point where to to interact with a handful of new people
[9993.12 --> 9998.80]  i'll be like okay let's take the whole company to disneyland you know which was cool a lot of fun it was
[9998.80 --> 10005.04]  fun yeah we're back now um what well no i mean we didn't talk about it much before we left so now
[10005.04 --> 10010.16]  that we're now that we're back okay i just want to say float plane you guys got an exclusive video out
[10010.16 --> 10018.48]  of that i explicitly forbade multiple people um to work on that project so i would like to make that
[10018.48 --> 10026.08]  very clear and i'm going to speak to the managers who approved some people uh working on that and tell
[10026.08 --> 10031.84]  them it is not approved next time wait did sammy like get told no by dad so when and asked mom
[10031.84 --> 10037.44]  i don't know if sammy ever talked to me but i saw people with cameras and i said you better not be
[10037.44 --> 10042.88]  working that's not work right and they assured me that they were working on personal vlogs for like
[10042.88 --> 10047.44]  their own thing and i was like okay oh i mean i think the whole full point exclusive was just sammy so
[10047.44 --> 10053.44]  if you was it i think so okay i'll have to i mean there's people that like feature in the video for
[10053.44 --> 10059.04]  sure but i mean the the footage of the the camera capturing the footage i think was just sammy's i
[10059.04 --> 10066.00]  don't think other ones contributed i'm not i'm not sure though sammy and chat today sammy dude sammy
[10066.00 --> 10072.96]  can't be controlled even if he was would you want him to be controlled yes i would he's not supposed to
[10072.96 --> 10078.56]  be working he's a very stallion i had a long talk with him at ces about how he needs to like say no more
[10078.56 --> 10083.04]  and like stuff like that well it's not even a matter of him saying no he was talking about like how much he's
[10083.04 --> 10087.20]  working and i was like brother you need to chill it's a matter of me explicitly saying no you're
[10087.20 --> 10093.12]  not allowed to work on that and him doing it anyway like that's a completely different dynamic did you
[10093.12 --> 10097.84]  actually tell him that i don't know if i talked to sammy yeah i didn't think anyone was going to be
[10097.84 --> 10101.76]  doing it because i know at least one or two other people that were doing it for personal vlogs okay
[10101.76 --> 10107.04]  well that's fine i told them like i know that was a thing okay i told people that's fine yeah but
[10107.04 --> 10113.68]  people were not supposed to be working it was supposed to be a workcation occasion from work
[10113.68 --> 10117.76]  yeah yeah anyway yeah yeah
[10120.32 --> 10127.92]  hi future me podcast listener question for the mailing team that's dhl what's the hardest part of each one of
[10127.92 --> 10135.52]  your jobs mailing team like dhl the carrier which one of us is h
[10138.40 --> 10145.28]  it's the hardest does this person just think that like people use random letters to address the show
[10145.28 --> 10154.80]  maybe maybe dhl you know what okay it's a new one um what's the hardest part of each one saying dhan dh a n then
[10154.80 --> 10164.72]  who's d uh okay well anyway duke duke did you see i was wearing my uh luke newcomb shirt yeah i
[10164.72 --> 10169.68]  commented on it nice but you by your facial expression i thought you might not have noticed
[10169.68 --> 10174.80]  dude my get up was actually outstanding you want to know the craziest thing about that and emma almost
[10174.80 --> 10184.64]  wore hers her duke newcomb shirt yeah that is awesome and i was like oh man let's not uh oh here i'm
[10184.64 --> 10192.40]  gonna i'm gonna send this to you dan okay uh okay this is uh one of the better shots that if you

[10204.88 --> 10210.40]  one i got a better one i got a better one uh this is this is one of my favorite shots because who
[10210.40 --> 10217.20]  kindness in hand it kind of looks like i'm being photo bombed except like obviously i know the person
[10217.76 --> 10225.84]  so i i go ahead and pop this one up get me out of the way oh yeah like jake just looks like a random
[10225.84 --> 10232.96]  guy that jumped into my picture that's a great photo yeah man they're i don't want to glaze disney but
[10232.96 --> 10239.28]  they are very good at the whole ambiance thing oh yeah dude it's a it's definitely a vibe um so
[10239.28 --> 10245.60]  note the custom mickey mouse ears um that were given to me by the one and only mr daniel besser
[10245.60 --> 10253.12]  are those amazing or what i wore them all day i'm so happy that you like them i wore them all day and
[10253.12 --> 10258.48]  for all the rides where there was like some risk that they'd come off or whatever i took them out i put
[10258.48 --> 10264.48]  them in my commuter bag in the little like secondary sleeve and put it down all carefully i was like
[10264.48 --> 10271.12]  i'm not losing these i let my daughter wear them um for a very very short period of time i thought you
[10271.12 --> 10278.24]  would be like you're a you're a you're a no why that's awesome okay what are you even talking about
[10278.24 --> 10284.48]  no i don't know uh it's always interesting to see what uh oh so i let my daughter wear them for a
[10284.48 --> 10289.44]  little while yeah and then the second she was inattentive with them yeah you can pop that one
[10289.44 --> 10293.12]  up as well okay the second she was inattentive with them i was like i'm taking those back
[10293.84 --> 10297.20]  because those need to not get lost today um
[10302.00 --> 10308.24]  so cool it's got a little sublimated linus wide linus face yeah because why wouldn't it yeah um all
[10308.24 --> 10314.24]  right uh the hardest part of each of my jobs the hardest part is hr the hardest part is other people
[10314.48 --> 10319.44]  uh i'm answering proactively on behalf of all of us yeah all right we can move on
[10321.04 --> 10328.64]  i dramatically do not disagree at all sick linus how do you deal with being the boss of employees
[10328.64 --> 10333.52]  who are significantly older than you when was the first time you became a boss of someone much older
[10333.52 --> 10340.48]  and how did you handle the new role uh i think mutual respect is the best way that's not always an
[10340.48 --> 10350.16]  option um especially up the chain like if you have a boss that you don't really respect um there's
[10350.16 --> 10354.40]  nothing you can really do about that whereas when you have someone who works for you that you don't
[10354.40 --> 10360.24]  respect um like you can kind of do something about that wait what where did this i thought i thought
[10360.24 --> 10365.36]  they were talking about ages yeah i know okay i'm just saying that if you have if you are the boss of
[10365.36 --> 10370.40]  someone who is significantly older than you mutual respect and just treating each other with mutual
[10370.40 --> 10375.52]  respect makes the age difference not matter that much sorry i probably should have started with that
[10375.52 --> 10382.80]  sure um i was like what are you talking about because i think that there's there's an inherent sort of
[10382.80 --> 10388.56]  um i think i think that everyone at least i hope that everyone understands that there's an experience that
[10388.56 --> 10398.16]  comes with age yeah um however i would i would think that someone working for me would also again
[10398.16 --> 10404.80]  like so i would respect that experience but i would also expect that they respect the experience that
[10404.80 --> 10409.28]  i have specifically and what it is that we do and if they don't then i would think they just wouldn't
[10409.28 --> 10413.52]  want to work here and i would think they would probably leave and in the same way if someone is
[10413.52 --> 10419.36]  working on the team that i don't respect and to me like not respecting someone means that they have
[10419.36 --> 10424.24]  to behave in a way that is like egregious that yeah it's not going to have anything it's not like they
[10424.24 --> 10429.68]  you know flubbed uh you know a spelling error in an email like that's not something that is not
[10429.68 --> 10435.76]  respectable it's it's more like you know theft or or you know being generally unethical like that
[10435.76 --> 10441.36]  that's the kind of thing so so to me like a lack of respect means that you should just like not work
[10441.36 --> 10448.48]  together if you can if you can manage it um but yeah i i think that age is age is a number to a
[10448.48 --> 10453.68]  degree but it's also kind of easy for me to say because i don't have a lot of people older than me
[10453.68 --> 10460.24]  who have ever reported directly to me like i'm an old guy at this company i'm not even 40 but i am
[10460.24 --> 10465.44]  one of the oldest people here i think i
[10465.44 --> 10478.32]  i have a few never been a problem at all never been something that's even been brought up
[10479.76 --> 10484.00]  never mattered at all well it doesn't matter as long as there's mutual respect yeah and i think
[10484.00 --> 10490.56]  that's yeah i think it's never been brought up because we've just always been good and i i mean
[10490.56 --> 10496.08]  i don't know like early float plane like really early float plane before like uh video calling
[10496.08 --> 10502.32]  was was cheap and easy and everybody did it yeah um a bunch of those hires i had never even seen the
[10502.32 --> 10509.68]  person um like it's like the the first time we ever had a float plane get together thing was the first
[10509.68 --> 10516.08]  time i saw every one of those people that's wild fun fact when was the first float plane get together
[10516.08 --> 10524.00]  was it christmas party what was it because you well it was the float plane christmas party because
[10524.00 --> 10528.08]  yeah because you guys did a separate one because you made us split off yeah you can't say it that
[10528.08 --> 10533.76]  way um and then it was a horrible disaster because i took a bunch of devs snowboarding oh that's what
[10533.76 --> 10540.08]  it was snowboarding i remember that didn't i attend it though still because i definitely no i
[10540.08 --> 10544.08]  didn't know i didn't go snowboarding but oh we they were up here for like a while yeah like i did
[10544.08 --> 10549.44]  something with you guys i don't remember what it was i don't know if you did that year maybe you
[10549.44 --> 10555.04]  came to dinner or something that must be it i think i definitely did a later year we had part of it at
[10555.04 --> 10560.48]  your house and we we like played board games or something oh yeah yeah that wasn't the first one
[10560.48 --> 10566.32]  no no i i'm thinking of the snowboarding one because i remember i remember you and i talking about how
[10567.04 --> 10572.48]  you sort of had determined that snowboarding might not have been the best choice we pivoted we we
[10572.48 --> 10577.36]  changed to board games it was great yeah everyone nerded out really hard stayed up late have a great
[10577.36 --> 10584.96]  time that's good but we required a pivot classic software stuff it's all good that's good um yeah
[10584.96 --> 10585.60]  full rewrite
[10588.88 --> 10594.96]  hey dan luke and linus long time listener first time merch message linus when was the last time you got
[10594.96 --> 10600.40]  royally mad at everyone and why also come to australia we love you guys at everyone we're
[10600.40 --> 10605.04]  okay ah see this is where i end up getting myself into trouble because on the one hand
[10605.76 --> 10609.60]  we're a small company in the grand scheme of things we were down at disney and one of the things we
[10609.60 --> 10614.24]  talked about while we were down there because it was a work trip and we did actual we did actually do
[10614.24 --> 10618.80]  some work on the trip even if i told people don't make videos because that's not why we're here
[10620.08 --> 10627.52]  but one of the things that came up was that disney apparently employs uh what was the number 36 000
[10627.52 --> 10635.04]  thousand thousand people directly at their california parks directly but there was like even way more
[10635.04 --> 10639.04]  indirectly because of all the you know the hotel infrastructure and everything else restaurants
[10639.04 --> 10649.68]  everything that's around 36 000 people at those parks in california and just put that in perspective
[10649.68 --> 10659.68]  disney land and california adventure park are 360 times the size of linus media group creator
[10659.68 --> 10668.56]  warehouse and floatplane media combined we are a tiny company in the grand scheme of things but when
[10668.56 --> 10673.84]  you ask me a question like when was the last time you got royally mad at everyone i'm going to respond
[10673.84 --> 10681.12]  and say we're such a big company that i how could i ever be mad at everyone like it's not like uh it's not
[10681.12 --> 10690.00]  like like you know if we get some analysis wrong on a on a data point for a review that like i'm gonna be mad at
[10690.00 --> 10698.24]  like sarah like what did she do did she draw something wrong like that why would i be mad at her right like
[10698.24 --> 10703.68]  i can imagine reasons because she uh like supervises stuff as well doesn't she or product
[10703.68 --> 10708.48]  managers or project no no i was saying like like data analysis for a review though oh she would have
[10708.48 --> 10715.20]  nothing to do with that i can't think of a single project no we have a hundred employees top gear i can't
[10715.20 --> 10721.12]  think of a single project that would involve everyone that i could get mad at everyone for
[10721.12 --> 10728.48]  like can you think of anything no we do such varied things as well i mean i can imagine a company that's
[10729.12 --> 10733.84]  we've people many many many times our size that does like one thing we have people so many things
[10733.84 --> 10738.24]  we have people that work here that i've barely met how could i be mad at them oh man okay so i was
[10738.24 --> 10741.84]  going to mention this earlier that is absolutely a thing there are actually people that work here that
[10741.84 --> 10749.36]  i have probably never met um but another weird one is when i'll be talking to someone and genuinely
[10749.36 --> 10753.20]  think like okay yeah this person's probably been working here for like six months or something
[10753.20 --> 10757.76]  and then it'll like kind of come up in combination uh conversation they're like oh yeah like three and
[10757.76 --> 10764.96]  a half years and i'm like uh especially in the cw side what like how many times have you interacted with
[10765.52 --> 10772.40]  bridget yeah like i mean it's happened but not very many i'm gonna look it up hold on i'm gonna guess
[10772.40 --> 10777.44]  first i'm gonna say four years it's been a hot minute i know that much bridget's been here for
[10777.44 --> 10786.56]  a while yeah oh crap i might get it wrong oh crap and yeah and then and then there's people
[10786.56 --> 10791.44]  where like you know their name and you know what they do no i'm pretty close but oh dude never
[10791.44 --> 10797.28]  actually necessarily met them dude i nailed it i know it's like foreign change yeah yeah let's go
[10797.84 --> 10804.32]  that's crazy yeah new people new people bridget bergman fashion designer there's the email yep i found it
[10804.32 --> 10810.96]  okay all right dude i was pretty close but like dude that's wild that's wild like she's been here
[10810.96 --> 10816.24]  for a freaking long time done a lot of like really cool stuff but you have never had any reason to deal
[10816.24 --> 10822.24]  with ms bergman because why would you why would you ever be mad at her well i think we you know like
[10822.24 --> 10825.60]  i think we yeah i think she was in the
[10825.60 --> 10832.00]  maybe not i think she was maybe in the conversation chain for that thing
[10833.60 --> 10839.52]  oh okay maybe but i'm not certain yeah so you might have you might have been cc'd on the same
[10839.52 --> 10845.36]  emails yeah yeah yeah yeah but i that's honestly like probably it yeah sure but like okay do you know
[10845.36 --> 10852.16]  do you even know who robert from cw is uh actually yes but this is one of those situations where i i don't
[10852.16 --> 10858.40]  know if i've wait yes yes yes yes yes would you recognize his face it took me a second to parse it yes
[10858.40 --> 10863.12]  you would okay in that situation yes all right let's see let me see if i can let me see if i can come
[10863.12 --> 10868.08]  up with someone i don't know if i want to be quizzed on this live okay you know what i'm not gonna no
[10868.08 --> 10873.20]  i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do that because because like honestly you could get me just as bad
[10873.20 --> 10878.96]  you could get me just as bad oh yeah dude don't even don't don't even it's not no i'm not i'm not
[10878.96 --> 10885.12]  going to but like i could get essentially anyone at the company because of flip lane oh yeah sure like
[10885.12 --> 10891.84]  100 yeah so yeah i've never been royally mad at everyone uh probably not since like the house days
[10891.84 --> 10898.00]  was the last time we lost an entire shoot and the reason i was mad at everyone was because
[10898.00 --> 10903.68]  our data handling practices were sloppy across the board so i wasn't just mad at the person who
[10904.48 --> 10913.76]  happened to lose the data i was mad at the general laissez-faire attitude that we had towards
[10913.76 --> 10920.40]  dealing with sd cards ingesting data ingesting it only to the server and never to a local drive
[10921.68 --> 10926.32]  and so i like yelled at basically everyone except you i think i don't think i was mad at you about that
[10926.32 --> 10931.52]  because what would you have done yeah i don't think so okay enabled them yeah i've had my times
[10935.04 --> 10940.96]  the sorts of systemic failures are awful i don't know in some ways it's like in some ways it's easier
[10940.96 --> 10947.60]  these days because like we both kind of it's very easy for us to be like hey like i don't know was i did
[10947.60 --> 10951.76]  i communicate that wrong like i messaged you the other day because i was like i didn't mean to be
[10951.76 --> 10956.24]  dismissive about something i hope it didn't come across that way like we're like that's a lot easier
[10956.24 --> 10961.28]  these days but i think because of the fact that we can kind of say anything to each other
[10961.28 --> 10967.12]  um it's a lot easier to like maybe almost cross a line just flow off like i'm not interested in this
[10967.12 --> 10972.48]  conversation right now i'm gonna leave you know like we can just like say stuff like that to each other
[10972.48 --> 10978.48]  which is it's pretty hard i was having uh i think i was having this conversation with emma
[10979.12 --> 10986.88]  where she was like like what would linus have to do to like cross like said line basically and i
[10986.88 --> 10991.04]  don't think it was a negative thing i think i was like i don't remember how we got on the topic
[10991.76 --> 10996.08]  okay no no i'll let uh no okay i'm gonna write i'm gonna write down some ideas i'll write down some
[10996.08 --> 11008.40]  ideas hold on hold on hold on um okay uh let me think oh i did i have a quoted answer to be
[11008.40 --> 11015.60]  completely honest i i i think it was emma i'm pretty sure it was man like some of these i'm just like
[11015.60 --> 11020.80]  some of these i'm sitting there going like i don't even think it'd be enough like like like you know
[11020.80 --> 11026.00]  ask you to do something totally unethical it's like you wouldn't do it but i don't i don't know
[11026.00 --> 11033.04]  if you'd care i've got one i've got one i've got one okay go ahead what what i said was you'd have to
[11033.04 --> 11037.04]  fundament i would have to it would have to be something that made me think that you fundamentally
[11037.04 --> 11043.84]  changed as a human oh okay i had disrespect your family that was uh that i think like you would
[11043.84 --> 11048.32]  never do that though so that's that's where the answer kind of but i didn't get this down
[11048.32 --> 11054.40]  oh because i was going to lean this down so you could oh okay um because i've fundamentally changed
[11056.48 --> 11060.88]  but like but like you can do this stuff you can i mean there's there's so many things where like
[11061.52 --> 11069.44]  i don't know it would piss me off but it's not gonna like to to actually sever the link yeah uh like i
[11069.44 --> 11074.48]  don't know man like i'm trying to mad like i ran i ran into rich the other day at like the skate
[11074.48 --> 11079.84]  sharpening place of all of all places and uh and like that's what that's what kind of that's
[11079.84 --> 11086.32]  actually what made me think of like like if i if i had like you just wouldn't do that yeah that's
[11086.32 --> 11092.48]  why it comes back i'm trying to think of like what how i could have treated him in such a way that
[11092.48 --> 11098.96]  he would message you and go yo man that was weird you know right like like i didn't i didn't talk to
[11098.96 --> 11105.12]  him because i was on a call um and i was just like like like like i couldn't really i couldn't
[11105.12 --> 11110.56]  really chat with him but like i don't know man because i i know that you're very like you're very
[11110.56 --> 11118.64]  protective of yes like your people yes which is chill i'm super super into that but that was the only
[11118.64 --> 11123.12]  thing because i can't think of anything i could do to you that's why i said that's why i went with
[11123.12 --> 11128.72]  your family because i think that's not an angle i could like you know like i like i could try to
[11128.72 --> 11133.92]  physically you know inflict pain look at look at the look he doesn't he doesn't give a right like
[11134.48 --> 11140.56]  so and i and even if i could i don't i don't think that would be i don't think that would be
[11140.56 --> 11148.48]  insurmountable nope i think you could put it behind you i think if i was like hey i had like a hormonal
[11148.48 --> 11154.24]  issue i had a weird reaction to uh medication i'm on i i i was in a really messed up place
[11154.24 --> 11162.24]  and and i you know i i'm gonna do better i think you'd be like okay yeah like whatever yeah right
[11162.24 --> 11169.04]  but if but if so if i were to like if i were to like you know be a i've complete you know jerk brute
[11169.04 --> 11176.16]  like you and slap someone i can't believe you did that you know if i did that to you i think you'd
[11176.16 --> 11183.28]  basically be over it but if i did that to like your mom oh yeah that's one of those situations
[11183.28 --> 11187.44]  there'd be no recovery that's why i said it would require a fundamental change as a person because
[11187.44 --> 11193.20]  you would never do that you would need me to have a good reason i think though either way you'd need
[11193.20 --> 11197.92]  a good reason because i think you're a rational person yeah but what how are you gonna have a good
[11197.92 --> 11203.52]  reason to slap my mom what if we wouldn't get the guinness world record if i didn't do it
[11206.16 --> 11211.52]  it's like most most moms laughed and you like ran out of moms
[11214.48 --> 11221.92]  okay the reference there is the one time the one time he really looked like he could murder me
[11222.88 --> 11229.12]  was when he thought i like abandoned him at on mount elbert i was having like pretty severe altitude
[11229.12 --> 11236.64]  sickness and i booked it down the hill because we had one last guy that had to sign the thing
[11236.64 --> 11242.16]  and he was a minor or something and i had to get to his parent so that his signature counted so that
[11242.16 --> 11248.64]  the world record was captured i think i also didn't know that luke was suffering altitude sickness i thought
[11248.64 --> 11255.20]  he was like gonna be fine so when he reached the bottom he didn't know that i was like booking it down
[11255.20 --> 11259.60]  the mountain because i was on a mission to make sure that we succeeded i've never really talked
[11259.60 --> 11265.84]  about this i don't think maybe i've alluded to it but some of the other people who participated in
[11265.84 --> 11275.04]  highlander did not want everyone to make it yeah and said so explicitly yeah which made me extremely angry
[11275.04 --> 11281.04]  and like actually did actions to try to inhibit the chance of other people making yes um it was it it
[11281.04 --> 11287.44]  it permanently burned a bridge between people yeah i'm not going to get any more specific than that
[11287.44 --> 11291.76]  it is not worth it that was not mad at everyone no because that was not everyone on the trip um
[11293.20 --> 11300.24]  and so as part of making sure that the mission was successful because we couldn't get the record for
[11300.24 --> 11304.80]  the highest altitude land party unless a certain number of people participated something that the
[11304.80 --> 11312.00]  people working against the team um oh i didn't realize i guess oh well this is a problem maybe i should
[11312.00 --> 11318.56]  have actually been helpful um so part of making sure we succeeded was we actually recruited randoms
[11318.56 --> 11323.28]  who weren't part of our group to participate in the land who happened who happened to be hiking it
[11323.92 --> 11328.00]  one of them for some reason whether it was because they were a minor or whether it was because i
[11328.00 --> 11332.96]  forgot to get them to sign at the top and i had to catch up i don't remember what it was their signature had to be witnessed by
[11332.96 --> 11340.16]  or something i don't remember why but i had to i had to like track them down i had to go down with
[11340.16 --> 11345.68]  them and i had to like catch up to them on the way down this mountain the reason why getting down it was
[11345.68 --> 11350.56]  so important was because at a like certain time of day there's a huge chance of lightning storms yeah
[11351.44 --> 11357.60]  um and one did happen we like literally saw lightning hit a tree in front of us and it was like
[11357.60 --> 11364.00]  very close you can you can verify this claim from austin evans and paul who were both with me at the
[11364.00 --> 11368.80]  time when it happened the second that happened everyone we had been hiking all day and the second
[11368.80 --> 11374.08]  that happened everyone just flat sprinted it was it was a very uh energizing moment
[11374.08 --> 11383.36]  he's not paying attention i'm shocked i'm shocked there it is that one gets it
[11385.04 --> 11392.40]  um sorry so anyway luke didn't know that yeah luke didn't know that i didn't know that he was in
[11392.40 --> 11394.64]  rough shape so when he got down
[11394.64 --> 11403.68]  there was a very good reason like any narcissist would have
[11408.40 --> 11414.80]  or maybe or maybe i just do things for a reason i don't know who knows um but yeah i don't know man
[11414.80 --> 11420.48]  we uh yeah yeah i think i think fundamental change is a way better way of putting it because that
[11420.48 --> 11427.12]  encompasses sort of all the stuff that i could try to brainstorm yeah all right what else we got we
[11427.12 --> 11435.04]  got lots hey dan luke and linus i've already read this one hey lld fellow home theater enthusiast here
[11435.04 --> 11441.36]  i'm constantly battling the ever frustrating hdmi cc can't even control any tips will it ever get better
[11441.36 --> 11448.48]  do i just need to buy an old harmony rip uh yeah you do just need to buy an old harmony remote because
[11448.48 --> 11455.20]  i am also having some serious issues with cec like it's so frustrating um no matter how i configure
[11455.20 --> 11463.28]  it across my shield my receiver my tv um for some reason the shield will just rip the input back
[11463.28 --> 11469.36]  randomly sometimes even when it's like asleep and i i can't even begin to fathom it it drives me
[11469.36 --> 11476.08]  absolutely crazy when cec works it's super magic and great and then when it doesn't work it's
[11476.08 --> 11484.96]  infuriating and uh drives me absolutely bat crap crazy i man what a great device that would be
[11484.96 --> 11491.44]  just like an hdmi pass-through that actually just does like great cec handling and you could just like
[11491.44 --> 11497.60]  you could just like ssh into like that device it could be man it'd have to be super low power it'd have
[11497.60 --> 11502.72]  to be like powerable over hdmi or something i don't know and it'd have to maintain hdcp somehow
[11502.72 --> 11510.00]  it basically it's an impossible dream but like a like a like a a a coupler that just had like
[11510.00 --> 11515.44]  proper cec handling and was just like programmed to deal with all the random stupid edge cases would
[11515.44 --> 11522.40]  be super cool because in theory all i need is cec but in practice it's just not good enough yeah
[11522.40 --> 11533.04]  hello linux danbian and temp luke os it's a good one this is new collecting gift cards until i can
[11533.04 --> 11538.96]  get a screwdriver sorry uh who writes the one-liners that appear after the intro in the videos do you
[11538.96 --> 11543.68]  have a favorite past one-liner i can't even remember enough of them to pick a favorite one there's
[11543.68 --> 11548.56]  definitely been some absolutely golden ones it's usually the writer of the video every once in a
[11548.56 --> 11552.88]  a while the editor will pitch in with an idea sometimes i'll pitch one in not much lately but
[11553.76 --> 11556.48]  yeah they're uh i love it i love it they're great
[11559.20 --> 11564.72]  luke dan what's your squat bench deadlift power lifter working in tech would love to get lift in
[11564.72 --> 11576.00]  6 45 4 45 550. why didn't you ask me wow you don't even lift wow wow they're on the cake master no one
[11576.00 --> 11580.80]  ever asked what it would take for me to not forgive you that right there red line
[11581.84 --> 11589.20]  it's all that matters it's not asking those questions have you ever done any of those nope yeah
[11591.20 --> 11596.72]  okay well all right carry on uh those are some pretty sick numbers good job i don't do
[11597.84 --> 11604.16]  power lifting a lot of my stuff is for therapeutic reasons um for that reason i've been having some
[11604.16 --> 11611.68]  not major but definitely existing back problems where like if i do anything that really involves
[11611.68 --> 11618.48]  my back after two days it's always two so it won't be the next day it won't be the day after that i'll
[11618.48 --> 11625.28]  have notable back pain and limited range of motion so i've been trying to solve that for quite a while
[11625.28 --> 11632.88]  now i haven't done squats or deadlifts in like probably at least six months um so i can't really know
[11632.88 --> 11639.60]  to claim where i'm at right now my and i also never do anything in in reps less than five so
[11640.64 --> 11645.76]  my peak not now i'm certain it's lower now because i've been doing it but my peak for squats was
[11646.48 --> 11655.04]  335 for five my peak for deadlifts was 315 for five and my peak for bench
[11655.04 --> 11668.72]  uh did i actually get it i know i did 220 for five and i i think i got like 225 for four and a half but
[11668.72 --> 11676.88]  didn't quite get the fifth that's where i peaked out um that's what i'm at currently yeah i have like
[11676.88 --> 11683.52]  i don't know i'm just so broken all the time i i used to be able to do more stuff but like
[11683.52 --> 11688.16]  right now the thing that's impeding my bench my rotator cuff used to be the problem i've kind of
[11688.16 --> 11694.48]  solved that now it's my front delt um i've been shifting to a lot of push-ups lately instead of
[11694.48 --> 11701.28]  bench press because when i load the bar up enough i'm getting a bunch of pain and crunchiness in my
[11701.28 --> 11708.00]  front delt and i'm really not sure what that is so i'm working on it um yeah i'm i'm all of it for
[11708.00 --> 11714.88]  me like i have i have no specific goals other than i'm trying to be healthier and less broken so if i
[11714.88 --> 11722.24]  run into some form of impediment um i am happy to skip trying to progress weights for a while if it means
[11722.24 --> 11728.72]  that i can try to fix um some part of me and as far as i can tell the stronger i'm getting and more able
[11728.72 --> 11735.76]  i'm getting it's not that i'm breaking in various ways i think i am unveiling problems and then
[11735.76 --> 11741.92]  addressing them and then continuing forward that's what it feels like to me at least um but yeah it's
[11741.92 --> 11749.68]  going okay and dan when's the last time you were at the gym dan uh may 2nd
[11749.68 --> 11760.08]  of last year yeah well it can't be of this year i guess yeah um i will be coming back soon
[11762.32 --> 11767.76]  you should really check out the knees over toes guy knees over toes guy's great i have been checking
[11767.76 --> 11775.52]  out for quite a while um quite genuinely mostly his content but a variety of other people's content as
[11775.52 --> 11781.36]  well is why my knees are like really good right now um there was a while there where my knees were
[11781.36 --> 11787.60]  screwed my knees are solid um my knees are absolutely not the limiting factor when it comes to things like
[11787.60 --> 11796.80]  squats anymore and i go pretty deep um my my problem is is yeah the weird really delayed onset issues with
[11797.36 --> 11802.56]  with my back and whatever is happening this is very the front delt thing is very recent
[11802.56 --> 11807.44]  um so whatever's happening with my front delt and the delayed onset issues in my back are
[11807.44 --> 11811.04]  by far the main problems right now but i could talk about this for literally ever so we should
[11811.04 --> 11816.16]  probably skip to the next message yeah i gotta apologize again for dipping for so long
[11816.80 --> 11822.40]  it's whatever man i just i don't know i think it's good to stay active there's there's that oh man
[11822.40 --> 11826.24]  now i'm gonna talk about more health stuff and we're gonna get okay well maybe let's skip it
[11826.24 --> 11835.60]  uh anyway hi linus can you update us on how your workflow has changed since terran joined as it worked
[11835.60 --> 11841.04]  out the way that you hoped what specifically you've been able to spend more and less time on um i'd say
[11841.04 --> 11846.88]  the biggest thing is um you know when i have an issue i have a single or a couple points of contact
[11846.88 --> 11853.36]  that i can bring it to uh it's not always going to be resolved instantly because the real world is
[11853.36 --> 11857.76]  messy in theory everything is perfect you have an org chart and you have the reporting lines and you
[11858.80 --> 11866.24]  but in practice it's nothing's ever that simple um but i'd say that specifically i've been able to spend
[11866.24 --> 11873.12]  you know less time on performance management and more time on uh making videos which is i think the
[11873.12 --> 11879.12]  best thing for the company like um when we were when we were looking talking recently about how
[11879.12 --> 11884.72]  viewership had kind of recovered to to pre-controversy levels right um it's a little
[11884.72 --> 11890.72]  lower right now but the reason for that is in the last month we've uploaded way fewer videos uh we're
[11890.72 --> 11897.28]  kind of video viewership yeah we're we're banking up videos right now for uh for the next little bit um
[11898.48 --> 11906.00]  and so even when things were kind of back to to pre-levels um we still weren't uploading as much as we had
[11906.00 --> 11913.28]  been before so we're actually in in a healthier state um from from that point of view so i and i
[11913.28 --> 11917.44]  do think that the best thing for the company is me being able to spend more time on the creative
[11917.44 --> 11923.36]  elements of things and less time on the business administration side um there's a bit of a miss
[11924.16 --> 11930.48]  um conception i think and i think part of it is the way that i've represented myself there's a bit
[11930.48 --> 11936.88]  of a misconception that i'm somehow incapable of you know leadership um incapable of setting a
[11936.88 --> 11944.48]  strategic direction um well i'm i'm very self-effacing in my sense of humor um and i think a lot of the
[11944.48 --> 11951.04]  time i will i will publicly undermine myself uh in order to you know don't get the joke build up someone
[11951.04 --> 11958.32]  else's role or their contribution and i think that uh what i forgot or didn't realize or hoped to give
[11958.32 --> 11963.04]  people more credit for than that is that people wouldn't take that seriously they would understand
[11963.04 --> 11969.84]  that while i have gotten extremely lucky to arrive where i have um i also did like run the company
[11969.84 --> 11976.08]  until we had 100 people and it i didn't step down because i couldn't do the job i stepped down because
[11976.08 --> 11982.08]  i couldn't do two jobs um more than two jobs i mean i was our primary host i was our editor-in-chief
[11982.08 --> 11990.00]  um and i was our ceo it was not tenable um also still and like i was also you did more stuff
[11990.00 --> 11995.68]  realistically like a chief creative officer as well like there was a lot that i was doing um and like
[11995.68 --> 12002.08]  does that apply to the ideation for creator warehouse yeah i mean sure yeah there's and then there's
[12002.08 --> 12006.72]  creator warehouse too which i didn't put a ton of my hours into every week but i certainly did something
[12006.72 --> 12016.48]  some um so i think it's it's less that you know i wasn't able to do things and it was more that
[12017.68 --> 12025.84]  i have a hard time um investing energy into things that i don't enjoy and i don't want to do and i think
[12025.84 --> 12032.16]  that i do my best work when i'm focused on the things that i do enjoy so like i did some of my best
[12032.16 --> 12039.04]  work this week right before wancho when i was working with alex on building a system in the new
[12039.84 --> 12047.84]  um calios strecom uh tower check this thing out was that on build corner yeah oh yeah isn't it
[12047.84 --> 12056.24]  beautiful oh i know oh i know so it's this thing um this was that that company that like scammed
[12056.24 --> 12062.24]  everybody basically yeah here we go kickstarter project by calios it's been resurrected through a
[12062.24 --> 12068.56]  partnership with strecom um we didn't want to work with them in like any kind we didn't want to
[12068.56 --> 12073.44]  take anything from them we didn't cover them at computex that year because they didn't agree to refund
[12073.44 --> 12081.84]  people but what we did say was we we'd we'd buy it so we we bought one of the backers who wanted out
[12081.84 --> 12087.60]  we we bought their their pre-order um so we've got it we've purchased it like anyone else would
[12087.60 --> 12093.28]  if we're building in it uh it's super cool i definitely have some misgivings about you know
[12093.28 --> 12098.64]  its history and how it how it got to here but like i'm having a blast with that it's like would i
[12098.64 --> 12105.92]  rather do that or would i rather you know look at budgeting uh i can look at budgeting i can work
[12105.92 --> 12111.52]  on spreadsheets i did it for years before i worked here but it's not where i think uh my passion lies
[12111.52 --> 12117.52]  and it's not where i think my greatest value lies so uh spending more time on things like that
[12118.56 --> 12122.64]  which doesn't mean zero time on administrative stuff like i still find you know i still find
[12122.64 --> 12128.08]  problems and uh the way that taren puts it is you need to be careful what you say because you still
[12128.08 --> 12133.84]  wield a lot of soft power is the way that he kind of uh phrased it because even though i'm not someone's
[12133.84 --> 12142.88]  direct boss or whatever um i have to be cognizant that my words and actions can carry a lot of weight
[12142.88 --> 12151.52]  asterisk also all of the hard power um yes but i go out of my way to not exercise i know i'm just saying
[12151.52 --> 12156.88]  you're not wrong but but that is part of the reason why there is the understanding of the soft power being
[12156.88 --> 12164.00]  carried is like you can't as much as you don't use it you can't ignore that that well it's it's all but
[12164.00 --> 12169.84]  it's also not all because there's an element of mutually assured destruction like if i were to you
[12169.84 --> 12175.20]  know exercise my hard power but the effect of mutually disturbed mutually assured destruction on
[12175.20 --> 12183.28]  others versus on you is still destruction and no i mean you're right in terms of
[12183.28 --> 12189.76]  if mutually assured destruction happens you'll be fine day to day i will be fine yeah but in terms of
[12189.76 --> 12195.28]  you know other things that matter to me a lot i mean not just shrink it can be destroyed it's it's
[12195.28 --> 12204.80]  i think people from the outside probably don't realize how fragile organizations are and i and i mean that
[12204.80 --> 12209.44]  not just about ourselves i mean look at what's happened to intel over a shockingly short period of
[12209.44 --> 12214.16]  time like organizations are made up of people they're made up of processes they're made up of
[12214.96 --> 12223.68]  of a structure that it turns out is shockingly fragile like it only takes a few pieces to to
[12223.68 --> 12232.08]  kind of fall out of place and the whole thing can come crumbling down um i think it's actually
[12232.08 --> 12242.24]  i think most companies are wildly more fragile than people think yeah i mean look at intel
[12242.96 --> 12249.52]  are you just repeating what i said on purpose i was a little bit definitely reading chat uh hell
[12249.52 --> 12255.12]  yeah we don't have the same thoughts um yeah hold on so unique username says wait what's this mutually
[12255.12 --> 12259.68]  assured destruction so like yeah i could i could literally just go full flex and i could be like
[12259.68 --> 12264.08]  taryn you're fired luke you're fired dan you're fired oh no uh i'm literally not going to sign
[12264.08 --> 12270.48]  your paychecks anymore see you later what then what like what for me now because like i you have
[12270.48 --> 12276.96]  to have that mutual respect i respect these people to do their jobs they respect me to not do that
[12276.96 --> 12282.00]  and there's like there's almost like a tension and i don't really like literally how the whole world
[12282.00 --> 12286.48]  works yeah i don't mean that i don't mean that tension in a bad way i mean the kind of tension that
[12286.48 --> 12290.48]  is like um have you seen those have you seen those tables that are held up by tension
[12292.56 --> 12297.84]  trick kill oh yeah those are super cool uh trick kill info playing chat said no luke's free computers
[12300.48 --> 12305.92]  that's the only reason he's here these are super cool these are super cool all of these chains are loose
[12308.24 --> 12313.12]  well they're they're tense well right but they're they're not they're not like welded they're not solid
[12313.12 --> 12318.08]  yeah yeah like they're they're just chains you could push it and it would yeah form and it'll like
[12318.08 --> 12325.04]  wobble um so there's like there's a tension that that holds everything together um where we all
[12326.08 --> 12335.52]  sort of rely on each other um and it would i can't the organization is that such a size such a scale
[12335.52 --> 12343.68]  and again i re-emphasize we are 1 360th the size of disneyland just that park right but we are still
[12343.68 --> 12352.08]  at a size and scale and we do so many things that if i were to if i were to just start cutting um the
[12352.72 --> 12359.52]  the results could not be predicted other than that it would be disastrous it's almost like you know not
[12359.52 --> 12366.32]  fully understanding what everyone does you shouldn't just like run around cutting jobs
[12367.68 --> 12373.60]  what and then having to like rehire them because it turns out you're a big dumb idiot
[12374.96 --> 12381.76]  um yeah the nukes are gonna be fine they take care of themselves yeah
[12381.76 --> 12392.72]  so that's what float plane does yeah i didn't know that yeah you're you yeah you flex too hard
[12392.72 --> 12398.32]  you destroy the culture and then that destroys the company right yeah and i literally can't do it all
[12398.32 --> 12406.08]  myself anymore there was a time when if the team were to come to me and say we quit um you suck right
[12406.08 --> 12412.32]  like this isn't a this isn't collective bargaining this is just you we out you know yeah you wouldn't
[12412.32 --> 12415.92]  have maybe been able to do as much but you could have kept the ship oh yeah i could have kept the
[12415.92 --> 12421.60]  ship but the ship didn't do that much the ship just like uploaded unboxings yeah and i could i could
[12421.60 --> 12426.88]  hire someone to film it to hold the thing yvonne could literally like you know like like hold the
[12426.88 --> 12433.36]  camera it did yeah quite a few times i mean in the early early early days yeah um but these days it's
[12433.36 --> 12438.96]  like what i'm gonna i'm gonna like create float plane exclusives and do ltt and do short circuit
[12438.96 --> 12445.44]  and coordinate you know procurement and develop a website don't forget the apps and come on you're
[12445.44 --> 12450.64]  also going to lose all your institutional knowledge there's still a lot that is still tribal here well
[12450.64 --> 12457.84]  that's the thing right is in the old days every job role i had done at some point now that's not the
[12457.84 --> 12463.04]  case there are literally people who work who have years of experience here doing things i have
[12463.04 --> 12476.24]  never done tension mutually assured destruction it's good it's healthy but again it's it's largely
[12476.24 --> 12483.12]  how like i mean society kind of subsists on it yeah i mean it's it's a dog eat dog world right like
[12483.12 --> 12488.64]  we're all i mean you've you've described it you've described the world as pvp constant pvp environment
[12488.64 --> 12495.36]  but that doesn't mean that it's a zero-sum game it doesn't mean that every player has to lose we can
[12495.36 --> 12502.32]  all win but there are going to be degrees of winning yeah and so we all have to be cognizant
[12502.32 --> 12508.32]  of the constant tension and working to make sure that our attention is beneficial to the people around
[12508.32 --> 12518.16]  us that we are together this table i think that to table is society we live in a society now i need to
[12518.16 --> 12522.40]  have this table this point i should have this table i guess like you can just order people to
[12522.40 --> 12527.20]  make a metaphor in the office yeah you know there are people here that could make that oh yeah sure
[12527.20 --> 12530.96]  no it's it's not that hard we were looking at guides a little while ago because james wanted to do it to
[12530.96 --> 12537.28]  do a tensegrity computer oh that would be kind of yeah where do we put the computer though like it's not
[12537.28 --> 12544.00]  really i mean in the middle of that i guess that's basically just a computer case exposed landis treats his
[12544.00 --> 12552.32]  employees like a table and we eat we anyway they're kidding don't worry
[12554.88 --> 12562.08]  what else we got there's still many hi ldl love uh love time viewer first time merch messenger
[12562.08 --> 12566.72]  question for luke what is your opinion on using technical questions for software interviews is
[12566.72 --> 12572.64]  there a better way to scope out good candidates i think i know the answer to this technical questions are
[12572.64 --> 12580.32]  good i think sometimes people go way overboard with it um like i don't know if if you're just
[12580.32 --> 12584.48]  asking like effectively like leak code questions i mean they just studied for that like does that
[12584.48 --> 12591.20]  really prove anything i don't know um i like having people actually just try to write something
[12591.84 --> 12597.52]  um like the we have a the the float plane test i try not to go into way too many details but
[12597.52 --> 12604.16]  the float plane test is generally referred to as the bad app test and we we give people a bad app and
[12604.16 --> 12612.24]  we ask them to comment it and identify why it's bad and then rewrite it it's short and small um
[12613.60 --> 12625.52]  and since the advent of not ai assisting but just fully ai written code we've had to like okay we'll slap
[12625.52 --> 12630.48]  this through a few models and see what it outputs just to see if people are are just completely copy
[12630.48 --> 12635.68]  and pasting yeah yeah i written code because we don't want those results um but that has actually
[12635.68 --> 12642.72]  become a somewhat fun benchmark because if you can't beat that then why do we bother with you kind of
[12643.20 --> 12650.08]  um and to be honest you should be able to receive that and then you know probably improve it a little
[12650.08 --> 12655.04]  bit here or there make it your own in some way but if you're literally just taking the output and slapping it in
[12655.60 --> 12666.40]  um it's it's not it's not great um we also do those uh offline um okay by offline i mean like not
[12666.40 --> 12671.76]  during the video call and as much as that's sweet because it doesn't take up as much as my time the
[12671.76 --> 12678.40]  actual core reason for it was i tried to do one live because i heard that was like what people did
[12678.40 --> 12685.68]  and then immediately within that call was like never mind um just take this and we'll have another
[12685.68 --> 12692.96]  call later send it to me when you're done uh because i suspect this is always a thing but that
[12692.96 --> 12699.76]  environment is not similar to how you're going to be working at all um and i suspect the level of nerves
[12699.76 --> 12704.32]  when you're applying at any company is high let alone when it's very likely i'm sitting on the call
[12704.32 --> 12708.72]  with you and it's possible you've watched me on camera in the past confirmed luke which is like
[12709.28 --> 12714.24]  for sure 100 i'm the best i'm the best interviewer because i'm there in the interview no one is good
[12714.24 --> 12720.40]  they're probably nervous because i'm that cool they they've now met their hero yeah so everything's
[12720.40 --> 12724.96]  downhill from this moment and they're realizing that in real time and that's a really hard environment
[12724.96 --> 12729.20]  to be coding it's really hard yeah it's long and it's hard it's probably the most difficult thing
[12729.20 --> 12738.48]  they've ever done the hardest yeah anyways no uh so yeah i i just let people take it and do it on the
[12738.48 --> 12749.36]  next one which i'm not even gonna ding that i was not on purpose which uh i wish i wish it was luke no lube
[12749.36 --> 12754.16]  la finir
[12756.96 --> 12759.04]  at least make them some chicken first yeah
[12761.52 --> 12766.40]  oh man no they just need the story of it they don't need more than that
[12768.88 --> 12774.00]  no yeah so i don't know that's what we do oh god let's move on so do these interviews take place on a couch
[12774.00 --> 12781.12]  buy your disinfectant at costco
[12783.20 --> 12790.72]  okay forget the mineral oil buy the barrel yeah yeah works hi dll just don't ingest it
[12792.24 --> 12797.92]  speaking from experience it's horse laxative oh that's also human laxative
[12797.92 --> 12806.24]  so yeah be careful with that well i'm not i know what i'm doing at the next company retreat
[12809.12 --> 12815.92]  hi dll what cable sheathing would be used for the upcoming ltd store cables have bad experience with
[12815.92 --> 12818.00]  braided cables shrinking causing kinks
[12818.00 --> 12823.76]  hold on i think he's fetching
[12826.88 --> 12827.28]  thank you
[12831.76 --> 12833.68]  early leaning into the after dark thing
[12833.68 --> 12841.92]  nice sack
[12843.52 --> 12843.92]  it's big
[12846.00 --> 12848.08]  very sizable and black
[12850.32 --> 12854.72]  with orange on the inside that's a little what am i doing like luke's interview coach
[12854.72 --> 12862.56]  uh so they will not have uh braided sleeving on them they are just the like the supple
[12863.28 --> 12874.64]  uh silicone style of uh like outer um not rubber but like silicone lots of silicone don't stop pointy
[12874.64 --> 12879.68]  um there's gotta be a way there's gotta be a way to turn this into like a ball
[12881.68 --> 12884.00]  uh well that's kind of flaccid in there
[12887.20 --> 12894.48]  that was tough anyway the point is that um they're yeah they're they're they're like this
[12894.48 --> 12901.92]  um they're kind of using like similar to like a hobbyist grade uh like wire stock um because i've
[12901.92 --> 12906.64]  found that in terms of durability that's the best thing i've also had really bad experiences with
[12907.60 --> 12910.48]  sleeving just not lasting over the long term
[12911.84 --> 12917.68]  hi dll why doesn't samsung make desktop cpus or gpus since they already make mobile chips
[12917.68 --> 12922.40]  apple has had great success with their m series chips they've brought out well there's your answer
[12922.40 --> 12930.48]  apple has had great success with their uh mobile chips has samsung they certainly put them in their
[12930.48 --> 12937.68]  phones does anybody else want to use them or would they rather have something designed by qualcomm
[12941.20 --> 12947.76]  like to be clear they're not terrible in fact you can i mean with um oh bloody hell what's it called
[12947.76 --> 12954.56]  samsung's decks with decks you can use a samsung processor as a desktop in fact oh shoot who's uh
[12954.56 --> 12962.64]  was it was it who's video who's extreme tech upgrade video was it that they were using decks as
[12962.64 --> 12967.84]  their like daily driver home computer until we did the tech upgrade i don't remember but yeah like people
[12967.84 --> 12980.32]  do it um yeah why don't they i don't know why why doesn't anybody do anything there's an opportunity
[12980.32 --> 12985.12]  cost i guess they've just decided that's not the most useful thing they'd rather make a smart fridge
[12985.12 --> 12987.12]  or whatever good luck samsung
[12990.48 --> 12993.84]  people are saying matt laverne ah yeah yeah that sounds right
[12996.64 --> 13002.88]  why is it so rare for newer monitors to include more than one display port input i have a variety of
[13002.88 --> 13011.52]  devices to connect and use at the same time so a kvm doesn't help so what do you want to do you want
[13011.52 --> 13020.88]  to have like you want it side by side is that right so okay uh one i actually share your your um
[13020.88 --> 13030.24]  perplexity because every hdmi port to my understanding costs a royalty fee whereas displayport is has no royalty
[13030.24 --> 13035.20]  per port so it is a little weird to me that we don't just all use displayport because like that
[13035.20 --> 13040.16]  would be cheaper and you know you look across the electronics industry basically every decision seems
[13040.16 --> 13045.36]  to be driven by how we can make it cheaper um i don't know it's a good question but you are right
[13045.36 --> 13053.68]  very very few monitors include more than one dp input however if i had to guess i would say that the
[13053.68 --> 13060.88]  reason you don't see pip or picture by picture support for a displayport is that displayport can
[13060.88 --> 13067.76]  very easily be converted to anything else so if you have a dp output from some device then you can
[13067.76 --> 13073.76]  easily turn it into hdmi or vga or dvi or whatever mini displayport whatever you need to do you could
[13073.76 --> 13079.36]  turn displayport into anything but turning some of those other things into displayport is not always as
[13079.36 --> 13084.96]  cost effective or convenient so i don't really see it as a problem because if you have a dp in and
[13084.96 --> 13090.72]  an hdmi and then you and two dp devices then you can just convert one of the dps to hdmi and boom you're
[13090.72 --> 13098.00]  good to go especially now that dp and hdmi are have basically reached parity uh or close to parity they
[13098.00 --> 13101.92]  kind of leapfrog each other now in terms of the bandwidth that they can support it used to be that dp was
[13101.92 --> 13108.96]  like typically a generation ahead of hdmi but now i think hdmi is actually ahead of dp but then we got dp 2.1a
[13108.96 --> 13115.04]  and that can do up to 80 gigabit but now it's the new hdmi is coming so um i guess what i'm saying
[13115.04 --> 13121.60]  is i don't think this matters and if what you want is for those devices to plug into the monitor and to
[13121.60 --> 13128.64]  switch between them um although it sounds like you are aware of kvms but are you aware of really good
[13128.64 --> 13138.40]  kvms like this one from the level one tech store let's go which can do 120 hertz 4k and usb 3 and
[13138.40 --> 13144.88]  multi-monitors which is like super cool these things are amazing um yeah so they have a lot
[13144.88 --> 13149.68]  of different configurations too wendell wendell's store is funny because he's got like merch crap
[13149.68 --> 13155.44]  that like is just merch crap and then he's got like actually like we built an incredible freaking
[13155.44 --> 13162.88]  product we did the best one yeah we like we thought kvms were bad so we were like it i'll build
[13162.88 --> 13168.72]  my own kvm what if we made the best with blackjack and hookers this one does four computers in a single
[13168.72 --> 13176.16]  one i'm trying to find the like the big chonker super mondo one yeah i think it's i don't remember
[13176.16 --> 13182.32]  triple monitors two computers here's this guy uh there's some there's some uh there's one wild one
[13182.32 --> 13186.72]  there's got to be a way you can filter by just the kvms yeah you'd think that but maybe maybe it was a
[13186.72 --> 13193.04]  custom one that he sent over to jake or something i don't remember products come on uh okay hardware
[13193.04 --> 13201.76]  really hardware i mean okay fine there was one like super thick boy that i've seen maybe it was never a
[13201.76 --> 13207.20]  real product oh here's a good one two computers quad monitor check this out oh i think that's what i was
[13207.20 --> 13212.72]  thinking of i think that's the biggest one quad monitor for computer that's the one never mind
[13212.72 --> 13222.00]  yeah this is the one that's crazy the fact that this exists is just so sick i'm so happy someone
[13222.00 --> 13228.72]  makes that i mean it's not cheap and it's also sold out but it technically exists i think we might have
[13228.72 --> 13242.24]  one anyway wow how rude i just have uh so many contacts he's he's just popular he's just popular
[13243.04 --> 13251.36]  hi lld linus how is the built-in gpu cpu of the mac order have you run any llms or games on it and
[13251.36 --> 13257.84]  have you used the new siri on it uh i have not used any of that yet i've been trying to figure out how
[13257.84 --> 13265.12]  to have my monitor scale properly so i'm pretty far away from doing anything performance reliant on it
[13266.16 --> 13271.60]  i went out to l i tentatively bought the tax write-off shirt after not being able to handle sensory
[13271.60 --> 13276.48]  feel of the original american apparel shirts and it was great are all the current shirts the new one
[13278.32 --> 13284.64]  no i believe some of the mysteries in this latest batch are some american apparel stuff that we found
[13284.64 --> 13289.04]  also the the but i think this is the last of it white the pure white shirt is different as well
[13289.04 --> 13293.68]  isn't it uh it's different but it's not american apparel it is one of ours but the composition is different
[13293.68 --> 13297.84]  it's it is quite different this is the heads up
[13301.76 --> 13309.44]  uh the reason for that is that um making a white shirt that is as sheer as our dark shirts
[13309.44 --> 13320.88]  right problematic right problematic right dude the archive pokies dude dude the archive of like
[13320.88 --> 13325.92]  products that i've tried on one of these days we should just release it as a float plane exclusive
[13325.92 --> 13330.24]  download or something because there is some hilarious stuff that they've had me try on over
[13330.24 --> 13336.56]  the years like there's this one time bridget had me try on like a ladies like white tank top essentially
[13336.56 --> 13341.28]  and i was like i don't remember why there was a reason for it but it was okay ridiculous
[13344.08 --> 13350.56]  any scope creep stories my company got tired of whining about me not being quick enough to work
[13350.56 --> 13357.36]  on another shop's gear now i'm training someone to configure cnc mills to pull from a networked ftp server
[13357.36 --> 13366.16]  literally everything i think this whole company i think that's the company culture yeah of just like
[13366.16 --> 13375.28]  oh more workings for things one um like dude the fact that we did that at all is scope creep
[13375.28 --> 13380.88]  like that was so incredibly linus you do motherboard unboxings we had no business now you're holding a
[13380.88 --> 13387.76]  screwdriver making a screwdriver um that's that's stored in a tech sack along with oh dude and it's
[13388.48 --> 13394.64]  partnered partnered with noctua yeah the the detaching like top on the magnetic parts tray on the
[13394.64 --> 13401.36]  precision screwdriver set like that like why amari in full plane chat said one million sales is scope
[13401.36 --> 13408.96]  creep and like honestly yeah let's go well that's the that's 100k well yeah the million one's still
[13408.96 --> 13418.40]  boxed oh okay i see i don't get it you gotta make the point i'm working on it you gotta seal it i'm working here
[13418.40 --> 13425.44]  i'll get there
[13428.56 --> 13434.16]  it's decently heavy hey oh yeah she's heavy boys there you go there's some scope creep right there
[13434.16 --> 13440.88]  a million orders have you held it no oh yeah wow that is like you would expect it to weigh less yeah
[13440.88 --> 13443.04]  it's nice it's pretty nice
[13446.56 --> 13450.88]  question for luke i recently got a pair of budgies what that's not a question
[13452.48 --> 13458.08]  i knew it was coming too i never expect it i really should by now what i don't expect it every time
[13458.08 --> 13463.44]  what uh qualities would you look for in a good bird vet and what are some red flags for bad one
[13463.44 --> 13466.80]  concern that i might have bumblefoot any tips
[13469.44 --> 13476.08]  uh bumblefoot i don't know um oh luke's about to google it let's go chat gpt vet
[13479.52 --> 13484.64]  oh wow bacterial infection that can of the foot that can affect birds rodents and rabbits we've
[13484.64 --> 13492.00]  never had this i've never ran into that before um man i don't know the the the thing that we did
[13492.00 --> 13499.68]  was we went to the only actual avian specialist in as far as i know the province um so unless we
[13499.68 --> 13507.20]  drove through the mountains for hours uh there was really no other option um well technically there is
[13507.20 --> 13516.72]  because there was like um like exotic pet vets but they wouldn't specialize in birds or avians um they
[13516.72 --> 13523.28]  would be into basically not cats and dogs um although i'm pretty sure they generally take those
[13523.28 --> 13528.48]  too but they they would have experience with other ones so we found the the only one that really
[13528.48 --> 13536.08]  specialized in in birds and birds are weird so i think it's pretty good to find a vet that can
[13536.08 --> 13545.68]  specialize in birds um that was honestly all we did uh i mean outside of that it's just general stuff for
[13545.68 --> 13551.36]  for for the the same types of things that you might probe questions for to try to find a good mechanic
[13551.60 --> 13560.48]  like it's you know um if there's something that you are absolutely assured in your knowledge of
[13560.48 --> 13565.04]  talk to them about it and see you know do they try to upcharge you on something when they shouldn't
[13565.52 --> 13571.36]  um stuff like that i would also think that it would be pretty wise to try to find a vet that you can board
[13571.36 --> 13579.04]  your birds at so that if you want to go on vacation or have to leave town for a certain period of time
[13579.04 --> 13584.16]  because of some form of emergency um there is somewhere that you can leave your birds that can
[13584.16 --> 13591.36]  actually take care of them properly leaving them with a friend is free which is awesome because
[13591.36 --> 13597.36]  leaving them with the vet it can be very expensive um but you're kind of especially with budgies they're so
[13597.36 --> 13602.80]  fragile they're so prone to death in incredibly easy ways that really can't be controlled that
[13602.80 --> 13609.92]  well you're kind of putting a lot on the person that you're leaving them with um like i don't know
[13609.92 --> 13616.64]  i've never had an issue with dog sitting for example but leaving our birds with somebody just sounds like
[13616.64 --> 13623.36]  i'm kind of setting them up for failure like it's not the birds which might be true it's more of the
[13623.36 --> 13628.08]  person like you're putting a lot on them like the chance that you come home to dead birds and then
[13628.08 --> 13632.72]  they feel horrible for the rest of ever is really high and that's just a lot to put on someone
[13634.56 --> 13641.60]  hi my boyfriend has been a long time fan of ltt and ever since he told me that linus is a swifty i've
[13641.60 --> 13646.00]  been listening to the wan show with him i want to know what linus's favorite taylor album is
[13646.00 --> 13654.24]  oh uh man people are gonna hate this but i don't really i don't really listen to albums i mean i
[13654.24 --> 13658.80]  think i don't know how many people these days i don't know how many taylor swift albums i could name
[13658.80 --> 13667.36]  hold on hold on red taylor swift i believe she has just an eponymous eponymous eponymous i think it's
[13667.36 --> 13680.16]  eponymous no idea um i'm not gonna look at chat dan um how many albums does she have can you find
[13680.16 --> 13686.64]  that out for me like how close am i do i have like you know a solid no again i'll do the albums
[13686.64 --> 13692.40]  you keep responding to things oh they're they're lighter now 11 studio albums five eps four live albums
[13692.40 --> 13699.60]  uh four re-records um she's not quite as prolific as king gizzard and the lizard wizard but she's up
[13699.60 --> 13707.92]  there okay see that photo she's not quite as prolific as the king gizzard and the lizard wizard but she's
[13707.92 --> 13714.56]  up there yeah i had an extra the in there but good it was a solid attempt damn it uh okay i give up
[13714.56 --> 13722.00]  the giz oh crap i missed 1989 and midnight uh i would have missed all of them if it helps
[13722.40 --> 13729.20]  oh my god reputation i never even heard of that um but you don't have one anymore eponymous okay
[13730.00 --> 13738.88]  speak now what the hell is speak now uh looks like a single back to december no no it's a whole album
[13738.88 --> 13746.64]  oh it's a re-record is it oh what speak now no was from third studio album 2010 2010 wrote the album
[13746.64 --> 13753.36]  entirely herself while touring in 2009 and 2010 to reflect her transition from adolescence to adulthood
[13753.36 --> 13762.56]  i think enchanted is good i think but i don't know man i um yeah i don't think i uh i don't think i
[13762.56 --> 13765.28]  have a favorite album um
[13765.28 --> 13767.44]  um
[13768.24 --> 13774.96]  hmm every single one has been number one in the us but taylor swift really which was her first album
[13776.16 --> 13785.20]  wow bonkers that's kind of wild okay what was on taylor swift our song i liked our song that's good
[13787.36 --> 13793.36]  teardrops on my guitar was huge man was that song ever huge
[13796.16 --> 13803.92]  and your twinsies yeah okay five twins do you still have thick thighs i think so
[13804.96 --> 13809.84]  i mean even though i couldn't play badminton i've been like on the stairmaster oh right yeah oh yeah
[13809.84 --> 13812.72]  you just you mentioned you lost weight hitting that stairmaster i'm back up
[13814.24 --> 13822.08]  just wasn't eating enough hello the talent how it goes pejoratively hey and the talent look how do you
[13822.08 --> 13828.08]  find motivation to do management as a dev it looks unrewarding thanks to your resolute commitment to
[13828.08 --> 13834.88]  transparency and integrity the reward is um what is it again
[13834.88 --> 13838.72]  drinking alone
[13840.40 --> 13842.88]  crying um
[13844.88 --> 13846.96]  i think it's breadth of impact
[13849.44 --> 13855.44]  you're yeah yeah that's good it's like teaching like you can do so much more
[13855.44 --> 13861.44]  like building a team than you can by just doing things yourself being helpful and supportive
[13862.32 --> 13868.48]  you're gonna need to manage yeah so like it is what it is yeah i don't love that part yeah but i love
[13868.48 --> 13874.72]  like dude well there's parts to love about that part though yeah sometimes yeah i think they're like
[13875.44 --> 13881.84]  okay living vicariously through the personal growth of others is like actually super rewarding super cool
[13881.84 --> 13886.40]  we're not living vicariously because that is a negative connotation but like like i'm not trying
[13886.40 --> 13893.04]  to dissuade people from becoming managers either i just i think there's there's a there's a lot of
[13893.04 --> 13898.64]  thankless aspects to it and there's a lot of really junk aspects to it and you end up being
[13901.28 --> 13908.40]  uh i don't know i don't want to get way too into it but there are absolutely positives you end up being
[13908.40 --> 13912.16]  uh
[13916.00 --> 13919.20]  oh man how do i say this in a way that i'm not going to piss off some
[13919.84 --> 13922.08]  various groups of people um
[13924.40 --> 13928.64]  the reward is you get a ton of flack yeah i mean that's part of it um
[13929.76 --> 13934.88]  what is this linus's career as taylor swift eras
[13938.40 --> 13958.64]  that's amazing how wait what this was from four months ago and literally doesn't have a single
[13958.64 --> 13965.20]  upvote that's sad because that's an amazing post this is hilarious wow why did why did dark rainbow
[13965.84 --> 13973.28]  oh you know what i bet they probably wrote i bet dark rainbow is like dr win or whatever this is
[13973.28 --> 13980.08]  hilarious who knows but that's that is a that is a golden sorry yeah carry on um but yeah i don't you
[13980.08 --> 13988.24]  you end up dealing with a lot of people's um personal issues inside and outside of work
[13989.36 --> 13996.40]  and oh yeah that can be really heavy the lines between work and not work are very blurry yeah and
[13996.40 --> 14001.84]  that can be really heavy when you're doing that for a wide variety of people at the same time so
[14001.84 --> 14008.72]  you're like receiving all of this stuff and it is usually negative because life is hard um and life
[14008.72 --> 14013.28]  is hard for everybody so it's just i don't know and that's you don't want to not do that because
[14013.28 --> 14017.36]  you like care about these people but when you go home at the end of the day sometimes it's like and
[14017.36 --> 14022.56]  if you don't care you can't care you're not cut out for it yeah oh yeah only thing that can motivate
[14022.56 --> 14027.76]  you to to work with the team is if you actually care for sure otherwise you'll be a terrible manager
[14027.76 --> 14031.92]  and you just shouldn't and sometimes it's honestly i mean we're coming back to that rewarding thing
[14031.92 --> 14037.84]  right sometimes you can help people get through it and there's only so much you can do about that being
[14037.84 --> 14045.44]  they're like manager at work um but sometimes you can help you know get people's mind off things or or
[14045.44 --> 14049.44]  shift people so that they're they're doing a different type of work or or something that can like
[14049.44 --> 14054.32]  help them in some way like you're not necessarily gonna be the solution but you might be able to be
[14054.32 --> 14060.48]  at least part of it which can be really cool and deeply rewarding but also sometimes it's just
[14060.48 --> 14067.44]  really heavy um and sometimes there's no real way that you can help other than just that too being an
[14067.44 --> 14077.52]  ear which can suck yeah um but again is one of those things where like i wouldn't want people to
[14078.56 --> 14083.20]  not do that like if you're on my team i want to help you um so it's just i don't know there's just
[14083.20 --> 14088.64]  there's a lot of downsides that i don't think um get a lot of light but it is what it is it's fine
[14090.24 --> 14096.16]  more for luke hi luke i'm an engineer at cloudflare what's a product or feature you wish we offer but
[14096.16 --> 14105.36]  don't go with something really selfish uh discount prices for tech youtubers that'd be great main
[14105.36 --> 14109.92]  registrar yet that'd be great do they do dot ca yeah yeah they're domainers are they having for a long
[14109.92 --> 14115.60]  time oh okay ah yeah support dot ca domains okay well well that's what i was asking because i know
[14115.60 --> 14121.52]  we don't use why you don't yeah we do we do yeah oh but not for our dot cas yeah okay so we can't
[14121.52 --> 14126.80]  switch everything which is like silly and how about that weird how about your domain registrar business
[14126.80 --> 14130.56]  like has more domains and then we could have all our domains through you that would be sick
[14130.56 --> 14136.56]  please do that can you think of anything else uh the tech side of cloudflare i'm like pretty
[14136.56 --> 14142.56]  happy with and always have been which is why i've been using them for so long um something that is
[14142.56 --> 14146.96]  like actually a big problem at cloudflare that you probably can't fix because you're an engineer and
[14146.96 --> 14155.52]  your side is probably working pretty well um is that your support is not awesome um and hasn't been for
[14155.52 --> 14159.92]  a long time and like there's there's a there's a system that a bunch of companies have where you
[14159.92 --> 14165.36]  have like the team that's assigned to you right and the the reason why you get direct emails to a
[14165.36 --> 14168.48]  team that's assigned to you is because you're supposed to like have those people for a long time
[14169.28 --> 14173.76]  but then you're either a quickly growing or quickly declining tech company because that seems to be the
[14173.76 --> 14180.64]  only status tech companies are ever in um so that team is extremely ephemeral you'll have it for like
[14180.64 --> 14185.28]  six months and then every six months you get an email from somebody you've never heard of before
[14185.68 --> 14190.56]  saying oh hey we'd love to have an onboarding call because you have a new team can you please
[14190.56 --> 14194.40]  explain what your entire company does because we have no idea because apparently we store
[14194.40 --> 14198.96]  zero documentation on anything and it's incredibly annoying and honestly just a huge waste of time
[14198.96 --> 14204.48]  wow tell us how you really feel it's very frustrating and then you had support tickets in with the previous
[14204.48 --> 14210.96]  team that they were dragging absolute butt on for weeks if not months and then those just get
[14210.96 --> 14216.24]  disappeared when the new support team shows up we literally had an issue with cloudflare that we
[14216.24 --> 14222.96]  were trying to resolve for over a year and the last round of trying to resolve it one of the people
[14222.96 --> 14226.48]  were like yeah never heard of this before never seen anything on it i'm like
[14229.04 --> 14236.40]  cool sick all right let's not go too far at them there yeah the tech is great though okay cool we have no
[14236.40 --> 14242.24]  intention of stopping to use cloudflare the the support team that we have right now does seem pretty
[14242.24 --> 14251.12]  okay these are mostly problems of the past um it's good we like your stuff keep going hi dll quick question
[14251.12 --> 14253.84]  to linus what flower lego sets are you recommending
[14257.92 --> 14258.64]  like right now
[14259.60 --> 14261.60]  uh
[14263.84 --> 14271.04]  flower lego sets hold on uh tax write-off sale shop all deals uh free shipping on orders over 175
[14271.04 --> 14275.68]  dollars whoa look at that there's a free shaft extension with every stubby screwdriver oh
[14275.68 --> 14281.84]  oh ten dollars off the scribe driver for the tax write-off sale that's appropriate oh did you know
[14281.84 --> 14287.52]  we've burned through like 60 000 shafts already out of our 100 000 shafts that's a lot it's like me in
[14287.52 --> 14292.32]  college we have sold serious question a few scribe drivers once you burn through all of them
[14294.80 --> 14296.40]  what do you do um
[14298.40 --> 14304.16]  off-site laptop bag 39.99 this is crazy this is a really nice bag really high quality bag
[14304.16 --> 14312.16]  full of lots of great pockets for organizing your gear um you cannot fit a submarine inside
[14312.72 --> 14319.28]  but you can fit many things inside enjoy it um that's a good question i think that
[14320.48 --> 14327.92]  there is still some i think i think the story is still fun you know that we develop the product to oh
[14327.92 --> 14333.76]  no i think that's fine but like do you do you come up with a die or whatever you're gonna need to make
[14333.76 --> 14338.64]  those specifically instead of because i'm assuming the way that you make them now it's just gone the
[14338.64 --> 14344.00]  second you're out of those shafts yeah yeah we're out of shafts once we're out of shafts um and you
[14344.00 --> 14349.44]  don't use like two for every pen or something no it turns out that i might have said that at some
[14349.44 --> 14355.36]  point i was wrong about that we use a shaft for the knurling and the top uh housing is is brand new
[14355.36 --> 14363.12]  fresh yeah um i think that uh we actually had this conversation in merch meeting this week oh they
[14363.12 --> 14371.52]  showed me a replicated crappy knurling job because they were they were like okay uh they did the worst
[14371.52 --> 14380.40]  they could um is this worst enough would we want it to be good or would we want it to be like the bad
[14380.40 --> 14387.76]  one and i basically went okay well if we continued to manufacture fail dry or fail pens that was the
[14387.76 --> 14393.60]  original code name of the project fail pen um if we were to manufacture fail pin pens we would want
[14393.60 --> 14398.08]  them to be as close to the original as possible and i don't think i would want to i don't think i
[14398.08 --> 14402.80]  would want to differentiate for people whether it's a fail pen or a not fail pen unless it's just a
[14402.80 --> 14408.40]  version two and you call it like the write-off or something yeah i don't know um that was a name that
[14408.40 --> 14411.76]  i sold from somebody in full plane chat like months ago by the way that i didn't come
[14414.96 --> 14419.84]  i think what we would probably do assuming we are successful enough with the product to continue
[14419.84 --> 14424.48]  moving through the remaining tens of thousands of shafts because when i say there's that many
[14424.48 --> 14430.40]  shafts left that's like virgin shafts we have manufactured pens as well that also have
[14430.40 --> 14436.64]  stop that also have shafts in them um so it's going to be a while before we burn through all of our
[14436.64 --> 14445.76]  um like faulty shafts for the original screwdriver production run um what to do what to do i don't
[14445.76 --> 14450.16]  know buying the flower set for someone just figure out what their favorite flower is and try to find a
[14450.16 --> 14454.64]  set that has that they have a bunch of sets for figured out what do you think is the right thing
[14454.64 --> 14462.08]  to do should we just make fail pens i think so is it still an interesting enough product development
[14462.08 --> 14467.52]  story even if you're not actually buying a piece of that like i think it's more interesting to say
[14467.52 --> 14472.88]  this was so successful that we ran out of the failed material and now we just make it for real
[14472.88 --> 14477.92]  i think that's entirely legit that's what the team wants to do at all i think that's entirely legit okay
[14477.92 --> 14482.64]  i'll think about it some more uh it's a cool product you don't have to just not make it
[14482.64 --> 14490.56]  i don't know it's pretty cool to turn that lemon into uh man because like let's say let's say an
[14490.56 --> 14494.40]  average sell price of i don't know because we've we've promoted a couple times so let's say an average
[14494.40 --> 14503.92]  sell price of like 25 bucks across its lifetime if we actually sell through all of them that's like a way
[14503.92 --> 14512.64]  uh how many shafts was there 100 000.
[14513.28 --> 14518.56]  to be clear there we did pay for those shafts and we did pay to and you got to ship them around and
[14518.56 --> 14523.92]  you got to re re tool them that ain't all profit you have to buy the ink cartridge and yeah put it
[14523.92 --> 14529.76]  in a package and all that jazz pay people to do all that stuff but there i i genuinely deeply think
[14529.76 --> 14535.04]  there is no reason to stop making them i don't remember what the loss was i think it was i think
[14535.04 --> 14541.20]  it was a hundred thousand dollar error um man that is a that is a pretty dealt with that is some good
[14541.20 --> 14549.04]  lemonade um man extremely tasty lemon dude we're good sometimes yeah we're like really good at stuff
[14549.04 --> 14554.72]  sometimes yeah um aviation aj says what about the pencil version that's still coming i'm more leaning to
[14554.72 --> 14558.24]  this point that it would be like it would be
[14559.92 --> 14565.36]  lame if that was the reason why you stopped okay i think if you were like you know what this
[14565.36 --> 14569.12]  product has run its course we're not selling like a ton of them anymore whatever whatever
[14570.08 --> 14574.88]  okay we're gonna stop making them when we run out of that's that's completely fine that's its own
[14574.88 --> 14580.16]  reason but if you're like oh no the product story was whatever so we have to stop now like that's lame
[14580.16 --> 14580.96]  i think that's lame
[14580.96 --> 14591.44]  um i think it would be kind of cool if we gave people a chance to like get one of those like if
[14591.44 --> 14596.00]  we kind of warned people when we were down to the last couple thousand yeah why not sure but then
[14596.00 --> 14601.68]  after that yeah we just yeah we make a success pin yeah yeah sure stole that from the negative and
[14601.68 --> 14603.28]  float plane chat that's pretty good
[14606.88 --> 14612.72]  i work for a large airlines and i'm currently in the process of developing a new operations center
[14612.72 --> 14617.92]  what challenges is ltd faced in internal communications i.e email teams that one random
[14617.92 --> 14622.16]  group chat lots but i don't know if you guys are ready to talk about our new deployment yet
[14622.16 --> 14628.88]  oh uh it's kind of up to dan i think there'll be a float plane exclusive coming where i kind of gush
[14628.88 --> 14635.20]  about the last month of my progress on it sweet and i believe the dan daly's series will be continuing
[14636.00 --> 14644.08]  so be able to follow the internal processes as we develop them uh forever nice until you get sick of it
[14644.08 --> 14651.28]  basically it's uh we're working on a new tool that is going to help to sync information across all of the
[14651.28 --> 14658.08]  various tools that we use so that um finding that single source of truth it becomes a little less
[14658.08 --> 14662.00]  difficult one of the ways that i guess we're talking about a little bit now uh i won't go i
[14662.00 --> 14666.24]  won't dive too much into it though one of the ways that i've really liked that dan has been bouncing off
[14666.24 --> 14672.72]  me for this thing for a long time is that he wants to reduce the thinking i hate thinking less thinking
[14672.72 --> 14679.04]  i've said it many times in executive meetings and taren lunches but i hate working and i'm really lazy
[14679.04 --> 14685.28]  and i wish more people at the company hated working and were really lazy we really kind of go into
[14685.28 --> 14692.24]  busy work that isn't fun or productive or creatively stimulating and the less work we do from doing that
[14692.24 --> 14698.16]  kind of garbage the more room we have to be creative and and think and be happy so if you have to think
[14698.16 --> 14703.76]  like how am i supposed to do this thing or it comes down to where do i find that information where do i find
[14703.76 --> 14708.56]  that information not even what is the process for this what am i supposed to do what task do i start
[14708.56 --> 14714.48]  with i have 50 tasks which one do i do what are my priorities you get a list where your priority is
[14714.48 --> 14722.64]  at the top and then you just do that one yep yeah yeah so i guess we'll talk more about it some other
[14722.64 --> 14729.04]  time but it's it's it's exciting it's been a lot of work it's gonna be a lot more work but it's exciting
[14729.04 --> 14734.64]  i've been really enjoying it this just seems like a good time to talk about flow plane
[14734.64 --> 14743.04]  flow plane's cool yeah this was really funny they uh quote-unquote promoted colton it's epic uh he got
[14743.04 --> 14752.08]  back from a vacation and they promoted him to receptionist um you should watch it i will oh no
[14752.08 --> 14758.72]  there was a flow plane call-up that i think we were supposed to do oh really i always forget i got swamped and
[14758.72 --> 14764.08]  for gorge as far as i know this is actually dan's fault now it has always been my fault or is it i
[14764.08 --> 14769.20]  see it should just be above the sponsors full plane this week got two really good videos this week oh
[14770.08 --> 14774.40]  that's hilarious so i accidentally did the thing and reminded me of the thing that i'm supposed to
[14774.40 --> 14780.72]  i'm supposed to play a time stamp from it oh you literally like almost exactly did the talking points
[14780.72 --> 14790.72]  that's that's amazing man i'm good uh okay here are we ready dan you ready i think so that's the linus
[14790.72 --> 14797.44]  laptop it is that button yep welcome to linus meeting group have a linus day
[14800.72 --> 14801.44]  see you bye
[14804.00 --> 14806.72]  like and subscribe subscribe
[14810.16 --> 14815.44]  buy some merch oh there's jamie oh there he is jamie also asked he was at the other building he's like
[14815.44 --> 14825.84]  you going over to uh you going over to studio i was like why nice uh sorry what else are we supposed
[14825.84 --> 14833.92]  to say secondly you might have seen this reddit post oh yeah oh okay this says it wasn't only elijah
[14833.92 --> 14840.16]  who was there all employees of lmg fpm cw got an all-expense paid trip to disneyland and sammy who
[14840.16 --> 14850.56]  wasn't supposed to be working did you put that in um no you can stare yeah that i already did as well
[14851.28 --> 14855.84]  um vlog from his perspective and other employees volunteered their time to be in the video
[14856.80 --> 14863.76]  timestamp 2025 that's the face of dedication say my notes lost that phone you have lost all your content
[14863.76 --> 14868.00]  for the day i'm just saying dude anything for flow playing you know you can see the phone bro
[14869.04 --> 14873.76]  can you come to this ride next time oh my god you guys you can't do that
[14875.04 --> 14879.60]  you're you're gonna give you give all influencers a bad reputation you do that stuff
[14880.80 --> 14886.40]  ah okay anyway what else is in here i ran into luke multiple times and him looking around for who
[14886.40 --> 14892.08]  was yelling his name was funny says sammy did you know it was him uh well eventually because i would
[14892.08 --> 14897.60]  find him that's hilarious i don't know if i always did but uh okay if you see these videos and you
[14897.60 --> 14904.96]  like them head over to lmg.gg flowplane or for the lazy a youtube membership at our ltt member plus
[14904.96 --> 14910.16]  tier will get you access to all the same stuff but at a worse price so you should just use flowplane
[14910.16 --> 14919.36]  yeah cool yeah all right dan what else we got couple more home stretch um let's see spent all day
[14919.36 --> 14925.36]  troubleshooting six dcs that were failing to talk thanks to slight time differences called in uh
[14925.36 --> 14933.68]  causing carabonos to smp failures what annoying thing caused you loads of grief recently oh my macbook
[14938.24 --> 14943.20]  i've noticed in many jeep oh yeah getting rid of that one too luke and linus how do you feel about
[14943.20 --> 14949.92]  ipt integrated project teams product teams versus regular functional teams my company just switched
[14949.92 --> 14957.76]  to ipt's and i am skeptical what what is an integrated product team i've not even heard of
[14957.76 --> 14964.40]  this dan if you're curating something you should probably know what it is isn't that your job no oh
[14965.04 --> 14970.08]  multiply dictionary group of people who are collectively responsible for delivering a defined
[14970.08 --> 14976.08]  product or process how is that different from just like a team what was the other one that
[14976.08 --> 14982.40]  they said was the other thing regular functional teams okay i think if we don't and if we don't
[14982.40 --> 14987.36]  know i think it's okay to say we don't know we have no i'm just like we have no feelings
[14989.60 --> 14991.92]  okay sure not all dev they're a mix
[14994.56 --> 14999.12]  but then someone sell someone else said it's single skill people so those are contradictory
[15000.08 --> 15009.44]  uh okay as an sorry we don't know as an enterprise storage engineer is there anything storage
[15009.44 --> 15015.12]  technology anything in storage technology development you find exciting i mean anything
[15015.12 --> 15021.68]  distributed is always pretty cool to me i love resiliency um anything to do with tiering is always
[15021.68 --> 15029.12]  super cool to me anything like with like automated uh storage tiers other than that like no i think that's
[15029.12 --> 15033.68]  all that's all that's all trends that are very much happening with or without my participation but
[15034.96 --> 15038.00]  it's cool high speed interconnects
[15039.60 --> 15041.28]  woo unified memory is cool
[15044.08 --> 15049.44]  but i mean we have it hello dll how do you keep the senior staff motivated and focused on the job
[15049.44 --> 15052.64]  especially when they don't agree with the business decisions at hand
[15052.64 --> 15057.60]  you have to reach consensus i mean at the end of the day that's always
[15058.88 --> 15064.48]  that's always the goal you have to get aligned and if you can't get aligned then it probably means
[15064.48 --> 15070.72]  that someone isn't being rational and in those cases um what you have to do is you have to rationally
[15070.72 --> 15077.12]  agree to compromise okay let's try this for a little bit let's give it a good real effort and if it
[15077.12 --> 15080.88]  doesn't work then we all need to rationally be willing to reevaluate
[15083.28 --> 15087.84]  you don't have to agree with everything that happens at your company i think you have to support
[15087.84 --> 15096.00]  it yeah you have to do your job um and your job isn't always to just agree with everything um but
[15096.00 --> 15102.32]  your job also isn't to like hardline refuse to do everything all the time there might be situations where
[15102.32 --> 15108.16]  that makes sense um i'm sure this has happened to people that are in chat right now where like it's
[15108.16 --> 15115.04]  it is morally unacceptable to do a thing that your your boss or company has asked of you um but
[15115.04 --> 15122.64]  that's not usually the case um so i think there's there's this concept where like
[15124.64 --> 15128.08]  everyone bickering over how to do something is almost always worse than
[15128.08 --> 15134.80]  trying to come to a relatively quick consensus on something and then trying it and actually doing
[15134.80 --> 15140.96]  the thing and then evaluating and going from there um so sometimes you just gotta do stuff
[15141.76 --> 15146.08]  and i mean sometimes like even from a management perspective sometimes when you know something is
[15146.08 --> 15152.24]  going to fail you have to let the person fail because as much as you can tell them it will fail if
[15152.24 --> 15158.24]  they don't experience it they don't get that learning so it just has to happen anyways um
[15158.88 --> 15163.60]  so sometimes you can be like well this is going to be a waste of time because they're going to fail
[15163.60 --> 15168.64]  it's not going to work um but it's not actually entirely a waste of time it might be a waste of time in
[15168.64 --> 15173.60]  regards to your project completion time but it's not a waste of time in regards to that person's
[15173.60 --> 15178.00]  professional development which is still valuable assuming they stay on the team so anyways
[15178.00 --> 15186.08]  big d little owl medium d huge fan of y'all was wondering if perhaps my favorite tech team could
[15186.08 --> 15192.56]  wish me and my fiancee a happy engagement jerry and brandy from justin texas happy engagement jeremy
