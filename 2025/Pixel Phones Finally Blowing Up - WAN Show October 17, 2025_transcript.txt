[0.00 --> 13.12]  happy friday everyone and oh welcome to the wan show we've got a great show lined up for you
[13.12 --> 26.12]  guys this week do we though it'll be fine capcom apparently doesn't see the value in bringing back
[26.12 --> 31.08]  their original games uh that's telling no no okay there is more to it than that it's not it
[31.08 --> 39.10]  no no no yeah it's not like it's not like that also the pixel 10 pro fold has gotten a little
[39.10 --> 45.58]  spicy going up in smoke i think smoke is actually a charitable way of describing it during jerry
[45.58 --> 50.74]  rig everything's bend test what else we got going on this week did phillips abandon us
[50.74 --> 56.10]  phillips phillips he tried to pitch this for the title topic for the entire wan show are you
[56.10 --> 62.94]  that are you that interested in what else is there phillips like the light bulb and shaver
[62.94 --> 67.82]  company i'm not caring about their old games just like almost every other game studio
[67.82 --> 74.00]  okay what else we got i don't know you want to talk about the it's got to be this log for the
[74.00 --> 85.04]  fourth time no it's got to be this one uh oh yeah sure chat gpt uh loses its darn mind if you ask it
[85.04 --> 88.68]  about a seahorse emoji it's pretty funny it is pretty funny
[88.68 --> 114.92]  the show is brought to you today by rove lab amd msi green man gaming of course alongside our rap
[114.92 --> 117.68]  partner d-run our laptop partner dell and our chair partner
[117.68 --> 127.76]  ball turkis i'm pretty sure that's how you pronounce it yeah yep oh they're both upside down
[127.76 --> 135.68]  now yep nice solid secret lab secret lab that that that's the one why don't we jump right into
[135.68 --> 143.68]  our headline topic today which is of course the pixel 10 pro fold causing the first major phone
[143.68 --> 150.48]  blowing up controversy since oh man what was it the samsung galaxy note 7 way back in the day
[150.48 --> 155.88]  although in fairness to oh you're doing that already no no don't do that now do that later
[155.88 --> 161.92]  do that later do that later okay okay okay during zach from jerry rig everything's durability
[161.92 --> 168.72]  testing of the pixel 10 pro fold he was able to break the phone close to the hinge with his hands
[168.72 --> 177.20]  i mean okay in fairness in fairness to the pixel 10 pro fold have you seen that man's arms
[177.20 --> 185.22]  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean if i didn't know that he was a tech youtuber i would think he was like
[185.22 --> 191.80]  a gym bro there's a few workout youtuber jacked tech youtubers these days yeah i know yeah i don't
[191.80 --> 198.08]  really get it i well actually i think i do get it you know how every time you're going through like a
[198.08 --> 206.84]  bit of a health kick you say to yourself okay i've got an idea every time i die in game or every time i
[206.84 --> 212.00]  you're saying we're all really bad at game fail and overclock right i'm gonna do i'm gonna do five
[212.00 --> 218.02]  push-ups are you the best at games then i think that what are you because i'm in great shape no no
[218.02 --> 225.76]  no what i think is i think those like jacked geeks and nerds are the ones who actually have the
[225.76 --> 231.72]  discipline to do it because every time i've ever come up with that idea i've done it like once and
[231.72 --> 237.54]  then i'll like i'll like die and i'll be like oh yeah but like i'll be like i'm responding in like
[237.54 --> 242.38]  five seconds i'll just and then i just completely don't do it you need an additional layer of
[242.38 --> 247.66]  discipline which is to play a game that actually works for it yeah oh dude and like it's it's one
[247.66 --> 254.12]  of those catch-22s right because if i had the discipline to be disciplined enough to work out
[254.12 --> 259.40]  while i'm gaming i wouldn't need that discipline because i would already have the discipline to just
[259.40 --> 270.56]  work out come on it's the same kind of discipline to force yourself to not do the thing you want to
[270.56 --> 274.68]  do so you can eat your vegetables you know so you can do the thing you know you're supposed to be
[274.68 --> 278.08]  doing i think it's a little different you think it's different i think it's a little different
[278.08 --> 285.06]  location changing is a heck of a thing um i think it's honestly for me it's playing the game that
[285.06 --> 291.94]  accommodates that better for me every game accommodates that no i'm pretty bad at video
[291.94 --> 295.54]  games what if you're playing like okay you bring up counter-strike all the time what if you're
[295.54 --> 300.16]  playing counter-strike but it's like oh dude i could do dude but it's like free-for-all i would
[300.16 --> 305.42]  my my well yeah but still you're just gonna instant spawn no no you'll you'll still have match in
[305.42 --> 311.02]  between matches and stuff that's it takes a little while you gotta some of them i don't think and you
[311.02 --> 315.34]  gotta see everybody's beautiful gun skin standing on their little podium and everything at the end
[315.34 --> 319.18]  of the round i'm not talking about matchmaking i'm talking about like server browser free-for-all
[319.18 --> 325.26]  oh i'm okay sure but even then when there's a map change i think there's like a like a winner thing
[325.26 --> 327.98]  not very common then you should do really fast push-ups
[327.98 --> 336.12]  i don't think that's a valid excuse uh there are definitely games where there isn't enough time
[336.12 --> 345.00]  between anyway after repeated bends the battery apparently became so compromised that it went up
[345.00 --> 354.60]  in smoke and we've got a very very uh very brief marvel television ad one moment please does anybody
[354.60 --> 365.48]  care anymore no well yes but yeah okay uh that's all i'm gonna show you you gotta go watch because you're
[365.48 --> 371.72]  gonna have to go watch the video on his channel yeah yeah great video love zach does great work um
[372.92 --> 379.00]  wow this is the first phone that has failed in this way during zach's durability testing
[379.56 --> 386.60]  i fix it's elizabeth chamberlain told the verge though as dramatic as the battery fire is we don't
[386.60 --> 392.20]  think this is necessarily a sign that something is wrong with the pixel 10 pro fold design and something
[392.20 --> 397.72]  that some random person on reddit i don't have the citation here because it's not in my notes
[397.72 --> 405.56]  also noticed that was that the phone was seemingly fully charged when zach performed his bend test and
[405.56 --> 412.52]  the amount of charge the charge state of the battery uh impacts directly how much energy is stored in it
[412.52 --> 420.68]  and therefore what the risk of catastrophic failure could be um until i i would i would i would tend to
[420.68 --> 429.56]  agree until we start seeing more of these uh more of these failures in the wild i wouldn't necessarily go
[429.56 --> 433.80]  yeah that's why you shouldn't buy a pixel 10 pro fold um
[433.80 --> 442.20]  um i would say there's plenty of other reasons not to buy a pixel 10 pro fold it's just it's gotten
[442.20 --> 449.48]  it's gotten ridiculous luke it's too expensive and to be clear this applies equally to samsung's
[449.48 --> 455.24]  folding devices like we're talking about by the time you know we account for currency conversion but
[455.24 --> 460.20]  even in us dollars we're talking about devices that by the time you you know pay sales tax on them
[460.20 --> 465.88]  they're getting dangerously close to a couple thousand us dollars i mean you know for us we're
[465.88 --> 473.56]  talking well over 2500 canadian dollars for a phone like when did this happen with the folds mostly
[474.52 --> 479.96]  i mean phone prices have been creeping slightly but i honestly don't think for a while there there was a
[481.32 --> 485.24]  it feels like there was a relatively big jump a while ago and since then they've been
[486.12 --> 491.16]  relatively flat i think that big jump from my perspective though might have been pixels trying
[491.16 --> 497.16]  to catch up with apple pricing so i know there was news articles coming out talking about how
[497.16 --> 503.64]  uh google was perceiving that their phones were valued as lower than iphones because the price was lower
[505.48 --> 510.20]  so they actually raised the price for like marketing reasons also because it's nice to raise your price but
[510.20 --> 514.68]  like yeah part of it was legitimately being like no look we want to be in the same category
[515.72 --> 524.36]  i don't know if that's the entire problem google i i i think the problem is one man okay this is an
[524.36 --> 531.80]  interesting conversation how would you fix google's branding and positioning issue and to be clear i'm
[531.80 --> 539.48]  not saying that it's a universal problem like what's android's market share in like india it's like 90 or
[539.48 --> 545.00]  something like that i don't know that that number is quite right but it's like extremely one-sided in
[545.00 --> 555.40]  certain markets towards android but specifically in the us for younger us buyers apple is dominant like
[555.40 --> 564.36]  absolutely completely dominant and not because the price is higher the price is higher so that apple can be
[564.36 --> 570.44]  very profitable on all the iphones that they sell to young americans um the reason that they're able to
[570.44 --> 576.84]  command this pricing is because of the brand association that quite frankly google just doesn't have
[576.84 --> 585.56]  google doesn't have a sexy brand and because of the way that apple locks in their users through their
[585.56 --> 593.88]  social lives and you know not just in ways that you and i would kind of mock um where people will be
[593.88 --> 600.20]  socially ostracized for not having an iphone because that's the dumbest thing ever um but in ways that
[600.20 --> 606.20]  are are even more effective than that like it's not just the color of the bubble it's the fact that
[606.20 --> 611.08]  you know if you're the one person who doesn't have an iphone then your group chats you know won't work
[611.08 --> 617.48]  properly or whatever else and theoretically that is you know addressed through rcs but i don't know what
[617.48 --> 623.00]  your experience has been like with rcs mine's been a little bit inconsistent um and it fails over to
[623.72 --> 633.72]  classic sms or mms on not a frequent basis but on a sometimes basis on a more than i don't have a
[633.72 --> 641.48]  data connection right now basis so it's just not quite it it's not quite there the vast majority of
[641.48 --> 648.52]  people i talk to these days converse over discord to the point where like i know an entire company that
[648.52 --> 655.40]  i work with closely often works entirely through discord um all of their employees talk through
[655.40 --> 662.36]  discord a lot of the creators that i'll talk to you for full plane or whatever else like to converse
[662.36 --> 667.72]  through discord more than anything else well the thing is that discord is multi-platform that's always
[667.72 --> 672.20]  been my issue with that's what i'm kind of saying is like i don't actually run into this very often
[672.20 --> 677.40]  right because not a ton of people that i talk to use texting you're not a teenage american boy
[677.40 --> 682.20]  it's weird that they're going back to texting i i look i don't i don't get it either because to me
[682.84 --> 690.12]  the simple fact that an app is not multi-platform makes it utterly irrelevant because i won't always be
[690.12 --> 697.08]  on that platform and it makes sense that in your social circle the the platform of choice would be
[697.08 --> 702.12]  discord because basically any gamer would have that exact same problem you're not going to be on your
[702.12 --> 707.56]  macbook or your ipad or your iphone while you're playing video games a lot of these people are
[707.56 --> 715.08]  professionals with like their photo is like them in business attire and their name is like their first
[715.08 --> 721.48]  name and then the business that they work for okay but are they gamers i don't know to be honest oh okay
[721.48 --> 728.44]  that's fair enough like actually genuinely don't know maybe that's fair enough but i i guess what
[728.44 --> 733.88]  i'm trying to say is okay i definitely see it for the gamer demographic but even if you just have to
[733.88 --> 740.04]  use a windows laptop for work then yeah fine it's like automatically the second you have to use any
[740.04 --> 747.88]  device that is not a mac or an i something then you just it you just you can't just have all of your
[747.88 --> 754.60]  correspondences sequestered onto one ecosystem of devices if you ever have to touch another ecosystem
[754.60 --> 760.36]  nepal is using it for voting for their country's leader and they're using it for coordinating discord
[760.36 --> 763.56]  yeah and they were using it for coordinating their like uh
[765.88 --> 775.08]  uprising is that the right term hopefully oh yeah i mean discord was the primary thing used there
[775.08 --> 782.92]  wow but like what i'm what i'm wondering if i'm detecting is if android nerds use discord
[785.88 --> 792.92]  it's like what's the most popular type of phone in nepal i mean it's not america so android probably
[793.48 --> 801.56]  that's what i'm assuming yeah i don't know that you will that's great uh ploda in float plane chat says
[801.56 --> 810.92]  you mean literal discord yes yeah uh wow an ai overview guess i just won't read that yeah that's
[810.92 --> 815.56]  my new thing i don't even know if it's new maybe i've even talked about it before but i'm trying to
[815.56 --> 821.08]  have the discipline to not even read them nice i i know you can disable them i know you can disable them
[821.08 --> 828.68]  my general approach to using services operating systems uh devices is that i try to leave things
[828.68 --> 834.28]  pretty close to default because i'm trying to have the default user experience for the most part
[834.92 --> 841.88]  so i have left them enabled but that doesn't mean that i can't discipline myself to not read them
[841.88 --> 847.24]  but i want to know how google search is generally working for most people as just a professional
[847.24 --> 855.16]  curiosity sorry what what were we looking at there uh apple was 25 percent okay so xiaomi is 21 and a
[855.16 --> 861.72]  half samsung is 20 and then it's real me vivo unknown right all the all the rest yeah yeah yeah
[861.72 --> 862.28]  makes sense
[865.40 --> 873.40]  so that's it a pixel 10 pro fold blew up um honestly i think the bigger issue is just pricing and i have
[873.40 --> 881.48]  no idea how this gets fixed because i mean apple keeps being rumored to be working on a folding phone
[881.48 --> 886.12]  as well and i could see apple moving into folding phones pushing them into the mainstream more
[886.68 --> 892.04]  increasing the volumes of these of these screens that need to be produced and therefore making
[892.04 --> 896.84]  them overall more affordable for everyone like i could i could see that being something that could
[897.88 --> 904.60]  cause them to become more affordable and more mainstream but while one of the theories out there is
[904.60 --> 913.16]  that the iphone air is kind of a a first attempt at moving to uh like a thinner phone design so that
[913.16 --> 919.32]  apple can eventually make a folding device i just don't really know if uh i just don't really know if
[919.32 --> 930.04]  i see it happening anytime soon like it's been rumored for so long and it's been very clear what the issues with
[930.04 --> 936.68]  folding devices are and those issues are not going away and all of that's been going on for so long
[936.68 --> 942.92]  that i just don't really see the light at the end of the tunnel like the issues are clearly around
[942.92 --> 951.08]  durability hinge quality um scratch resistance of the screen like you've got you've got on the very
[951.08 --> 956.76]  very high end of android you've got these folding devices that you can you know almost scratch with a
[956.76 --> 963.08]  fingernail at a point and then you've got apple that's shipping devices that have screens that are
[963.08 --> 969.56]  so flipping hard that you know zach oh also zach from jerry rig everything had to kind of change his
[969.56 --> 976.60]  his little spiel about you know lightly scratches and they we moved a whole we moved a whole level up on
[976.60 --> 981.72]  most scale of hardness which is yeah pretty darn cool yeah so are they going to give up those gains
[981.72 --> 990.36]  for what so that they can sell fewer ipads also a lot of people that i know that have folding phones
[990.36 --> 997.48]  end up just using the like skinny main screen well when you're typing it's better like i i daily the
[997.48 --> 1001.08]  fold three for ages typing it's better a lot of times you just need to respond to something quickly
[1001.08 --> 1004.28]  and then put your phone away yep so you don't want to unfold it and go through this whole process you
[1004.28 --> 1009.40]  just want to answer quickly but i mean but the big screen i mean it's it's great for work and it's
[1009.40 --> 1016.28]  great for remote desktop it's great for content consumption it's great for reading which also
[1016.28 --> 1021.80]  content consumption but i think content consumption has sort of a connotation of like um videos video
[1021.80 --> 1029.56]  yeah or maybe maybe games i would say gaming probably doesn't fall under category i'd say that's its own
[1029.56 --> 1035.24]  because you don't consume a game you interact with a game you know
[1035.24 --> 1041.96]  he's having to think there's no there's arguments that you interact with a video as well he's
[1041.96 --> 1045.48]  having to think there's arguments that you interact with do you though yeah are they interacting with
[1045.48 --> 1049.40]  this video right now okay well we're live that's different the players we're live that's different
[1049.40 --> 1053.32]  you might chat but watching a live stream is definitely content consumption
[1053.32 --> 1065.24]  oh for sure i want to move on this is making me uncomfortable uh capcom doesn't see the value
[1065.64 --> 1072.04]  in bringing back their original games uh last year capcom released the original versions of the first
[1072.04 --> 1079.16]  three resident evils on pc but apparently it took some real convincing from the folks at good old games
[1079.16 --> 1087.40]  per gog's uh i'm not even going to try i'm going to butcher his name so sorry about that per gog
[1087.96 --> 1095.72]  capcom said we have all these remakes they're they're already a superior experience to those original games
[1096.76 --> 1104.04]  so they really didn't see the value in bringing back the vanilla versions um gog says that the re-releases
[1104.04 --> 1110.92]  have been a success though and have proved gog's argument that gamers want the originals was correct
[1111.64 --> 1117.08]  so our discussion question here is do you think it's important to preserve the original versions of old games
[1117.08 --> 1125.40]  on modern platforms even after modern remasters or remakes are released i do think so i think so too
[1125.40 --> 1132.04]  why yeah i i think sometimes people say like oh nostalgia glasses rose tinted glasses whatever i
[1132.04 --> 1138.60]  think sometimes you do accurately remember what it was like and those graphics due to the nostalgia maybe
[1138.60 --> 1142.92]  or whatever else i don't know you might find those graphics charming for whatever reason i just want to
[1142.92 --> 1149.40]  play it how it was and it's about more than just graphics i mean back when i i didn't i wasn't on top
[1149.40 --> 1158.92]  of it so i didn't do it but when uh blizzard kind of removed uh their older uh warcraft titles from gog
[1159.56 --> 1165.24]  because you know well reforged is like you know better now or whatever i i had really i didn't
[1165.24 --> 1171.40]  really want to give activision blizzard any money but i really wanted to own those original versions of
[1171.40 --> 1177.88]  those games and i didn't have my old cd keys or anything and so i was like i i'm very tempted to pick
[1177.88 --> 1183.96]  up copies of these before i can't get them anymore because i don't necessarily want your fixed balance
[1183.96 --> 1190.28]  yeah i don't necessarily want your enhanced experiences and in the case of like in the case
[1190.28 --> 1195.88]  of single player experiences for instance maybe you want to play the old buggy version and mess around
[1195.88 --> 1199.80]  with speed running maybe you want the controls to be clunky because that's more like what it was
[1200.44 --> 1206.28]  yeah yeah or that's another really good point and the reason that i actually picked this as a
[1206.28 --> 1216.12]  wancho topic this week is that i'm about 30 hours into playing a remake of of a beloved game for me
[1216.12 --> 1221.56]  from that i played when i was much younger uh final fantasy tactics so the remake is called the evelyse
[1221.56 --> 1231.64]  chronicles and they have improved a lot like the the modern nice to haves like when you're in a fight now
[1231.64 --> 1239.00]  you can just go back to the world map and and you you won't end up like there was there was a a
[1239.00 --> 1247.16]  particularly notorious fight in this game where you are you have to win a battle and then you go into
[1247.80 --> 1254.20]  another battle like subsequently without being able to go back to the world map and like redo all your
[1254.20 --> 1258.68]  uh all your equipment or like grind a few more levels whatever it is you might feel like you need to
[1258.68 --> 1264.60]  do you go straight into the second fight and you have to 1v1 a really powerful opponent who has
[1264.60 --> 1270.28]  initiative on you and like if you didn't build your main character which you would have no way of
[1270.28 --> 1278.60]  knowing to do around winning this fight you could end up essentially with a no progression state uh if you
[1278.60 --> 1285.80]  didn't happen to save early enough to go back and and grind up and learn useful abilities for this fight
[1285.80 --> 1293.48]  final fantasy 6 had a few moments like that so you know the new version of tactics has has very much
[1293.48 --> 1299.48]  nice to have modern creature comforts that allow you to back out of that fight at that point you
[1299.48 --> 1304.92]  obviously lose any xp or items that you gained during this progression but no matter what it's got
[1304.92 --> 1311.64]  auto save which is nice you can just go back out and go do some stuff um but what i noticed is that some
[1311.64 --> 1321.32]  of the modern niceties have actually taken away from the game they've made it so there's certain content
[1321.32 --> 1329.64]  that you can just skip you can just not bother with so one of the things that they added that
[1330.60 --> 1337.64]  i've definitely felt was really nice is the ability to flee from random battles so it used to be that as
[1337.64 --> 1342.68]  you were moving around on the world map every time you passed over a certain location anything but
[1342.68 --> 1347.96]  anything but a city uh you could hit a random battle because it's final fantasy that's sort of
[1347.96 --> 1354.36]  that's part of the game that's sort of a core element of final fantasy is the annoyance and frustration
[1354.36 --> 1362.20]  and the grind of random battles and so being able to skip them is great because when you go to the towns
[1362.20 --> 1368.20]  and you go to the tavern there's these missions that you can send your party members off on and
[1368.20 --> 1374.52]  they'll come back with uh job points so they'll like level up their job abilities um which is like your
[1374.52 --> 1381.64]  class yeah they'll get gold um so you some of them can be extremely lucrative and then you'll you'll also
[1381.64 --> 1387.16]  find like random relics or whatever so you can become a treasure hunter it doesn't really have any benefit but
[1387.16 --> 1393.32]  it plays a nice you know dopamine releasing music and your characters jump around and get excited
[1393.32 --> 1399.88]  about it so whatever sure great um but the way that you do these is you go to the town and then you you
[1399.88 --> 1408.20]  assign a few of your a few of your random party members to go off on this mission and then every dot
[1408.20 --> 1414.92]  that you go over on the map is one day and the mission lasts for usually anywhere from like nine to
[1414.92 --> 1421.96]  14 days or kind of somewhere in that range so the whole idea of this mechanic was that you had to
[1421.96 --> 1429.96]  build up a whole roster of party members besides just your main five that you take into every fight
[1429.96 --> 1436.44]  because they're your best ones and they only become more bester the more that you use them because
[1436.44 --> 1441.88]  they'll continue to level up and level up and level up um so you had to maintain a larger roster so that
[1441.88 --> 1447.16]  you had guys to send on these missions and so that you could survive the random fights that you would
[1447.16 --> 1453.40]  go through before you could come get your guys back with all their their booty right well now you can
[1453.40 --> 1459.48]  just move around on the map for a little bit flee from all the fights and then just collect the golden
[1459.48 --> 1465.48]  job points so you didn't you didn't earn it that's why i mentioned my thing about controls um is like in
[1466.20 --> 1470.60]  say the original starcraft you could only select a certain amount of units if i remember correctly
[1471.08 --> 1477.96]  in one drag select and then i don't remember but was there bindable groups uh i'm trying to remember
[1477.96 --> 1484.52]  like like shift one yeah yeah starcraft warcraft 3 definitely had it three yeah i don't remember if
[1484.52 --> 1493.16]  starcraft had it uh the the mcg says yes starcraft had it i don't think there was like different forms of
[1493.16 --> 1498.92]  it or something but either way there's like there's like microing shortcuts that kind of come in in
[1498.92 --> 1507.16]  later versions right which are a difficulty changer a hundred percent so like having those old controls
[1507.16 --> 1515.96]  might feel worse sure but it might make the game easier right oh yeah which is like so basically the
[1515.96 --> 1519.88]  thing that you're saying but it's it's slightly different is through the control route but it's like
[1519.88 --> 1525.56]  oh i've got one that's very similar sure so another really nice to have is that in final
[1525.56 --> 1531.56]  fantasy tactics the original when you moved on the battlefield it would say are you sure and you'd be
[1531.56 --> 1539.40]  like yes you're moved it's like chess rules once you let go of the piece it's there it doesn't matter
[1539.40 --> 1546.92]  if immediately go oh my god no no oh no it doesn't matter you're there um and one of the things that
[1546.92 --> 1558.28]  made that really challenging was that depending on my zodiac sign and your zodiac sign and my specific
[1558.28 --> 1565.16]  characters attributes and yours i could do dramatically different damage with the same attack to one
[1565.16 --> 1572.04]  opponent versus another one but once i moved i couldn't know how much until i moved within range
[1572.04 --> 1579.08]  and made and and like lined up an attack information and then it would and then it would predict you know how much
[1579.08 --> 1585.08]  damage i'm going to do got it and that can be really important in a tactics game because a difference of 10
[1585.08 --> 1589.88]  percent in my damage dealing could be the difference between a ko and
[1590.52 --> 1595.48]  overextending myself and completely turning the tide of the fight yeah so in the remake
[1595.48 --> 1603.16]  you can just you can just shop around for the best move so you can just move there and go okay how much
[1603.16 --> 1608.76]  damage can i do to that guy um no i okay now move there and then see how much damage i can do there and
[1608.76 --> 1613.56]  then i can undo my move and i can do that as many times as i want unless i have a certain ability equipped
[1613.56 --> 1621.48]  that is like a like a move find item or a move um gain job points or like something like that like
[1621.48 --> 1625.96]  there's certain abilities that that lock your ability to unmoove that makes sense but it makes it
[1627.00 --> 1636.84]  markedly markedly easier um and the only way that they sort of countered all of this but was by adding
[1636.84 --> 1642.12]  a more difficult mode they added a tactician difficulty but they took the laziest possible
[1642.12 --> 1648.68]  approach to increasing difficulty where instead of enhancing the enemy ai for instance like it still
[1648.68 --> 1655.96]  does shockingly stupid stuff uh they just they just nerfed my damage and buffed theirs yeah i hate
[1655.96 --> 1663.32]  that i hate just like number go up difficulty yeah stuff i mean to a certain degree sure but i think
[1663.32 --> 1669.16]  one of the most egregious modern examples of that is the oblivion remake where there's like two
[1669.16 --> 1672.92]  difficulty levels i don't remember what they are i'm sure chat will know um they've been on a thing
[1672.92 --> 1680.84]  today um where you you jump up and it like doubles or triples the enemy hp like it's it's just a wild
[1680.84 --> 1684.76]  experience you you play on one setting it's like wow this is way too easy you play on the other setting
[1684.76 --> 1690.36]  it's like okay it feels like i'm playing wall yeah and i just have to stab this yeah adept to expert
[1690.36 --> 1697.16]  sure i don't know you just have to stab things like i i don't know you go from like one-shotting
[1697.16 --> 1702.44]  things to fights take three minutes like it makes no sense at all and they recognized it pretty quick
[1702.44 --> 1709.32]  and i think they said that they were going to change it but yikes i mean fights and i i mean i didn't i
[1709.32 --> 1715.64]  only played the original oblivion but i know that i do remember some fights just being a grind to the
[1715.64 --> 1720.04]  point where it's almost like immersion breaking oh yeah and then you have to because then it takes
[1720.04 --> 1723.96]  so long that you take a bunch of damage now you have to run and heal for a while so that adds to the
[1723.96 --> 1729.32]  total time and then well i just mean it at a certain point it doesn't matter how tough you are
[1729.32 --> 1738.92]  if you're made of flesh and i'm holding a big giant metal sharp thing sure there's only so many times
[1738.92 --> 1744.20]  and like you know the animation has blood coming off of you like it's just there were these um the
[1744.20 --> 1752.04]  original far cry had these horrible like big brutes that show up towards the later stages of the game
[1752.04 --> 1758.36]  and i remember somehow take more bullets i remember being stuck in this one point that was just
[1758.36 --> 1765.56]  incredibly frustrating because you had to kind of time it perfectly to get like it was like multiple
[1765.56 --> 1773.80]  rockets you have to hit these stupid things with and i'm just like no no matter what you are no matter
[1773.80 --> 1787.00]  how tough you are if you are made of flesh and blood and bones a rocket blows you up like i'm no no bullets
[1787.00 --> 1793.00]  fine you know you could you could be shot a few times and you could still be just like you know
[1793.00 --> 1798.76]  messed up enough to keep moving towards me or something like i can i i can handle there are some
[1798.76 --> 1805.48]  examples suspension of disbelief yeah around that or you know you could be you could have a few arrows
[1805.48 --> 1809.88]  in you and you could like rip it off and like come after me or whatever like sure you could have a
[1809.88 --> 1815.32]  grenade you know go off next to you and it blows off your arm or whatever but you still like you know
[1815.32 --> 1819.64]  you're not you're a zombie or something you stagger towards me and you like grab onto me i can i can get
[1819.64 --> 1825.80]  behind any of that close the odd artery while it blew your arm off a rocket launcher to the face like i i
[1825.80 --> 1831.00]  still it's like one of those really old memories because i could have been no older than like when
[1831.00 --> 1838.60]  did far cry come out like i was i was like 16 or something right like it but i still remember it even
[1838.60 --> 1846.20]  though that was yeah exactly even though that was uh 21 years ago because i was just so mad because i
[1846.20 --> 1851.00]  died on this section a bunch of times i finally came up with an idea i was like okay i have like i have
[1851.00 --> 1857.88]  one rocket and then i got my shot off like perfectly i hit him in the face with it and i'm like okay
[1857.88 --> 1865.24]  surely that must have killed and i'm dead and it's just like that's not fun and you can you can limit
[1865.24 --> 1870.92]  the difficulty in other ways you can make you could make a rocket really hard to aim you know you make
[1870.92 --> 1877.48]  the crosshair move sure you could severely restrict the ammo because it was already an issue in that game
[1877.48 --> 1882.20]  where you couldn't just like like carry an unlimited number of weapons and stuff you so you could limit
[1882.20 --> 1886.84]  the number of weapons that i can carry i can only carry two weapons and so and i can only carry two
[1886.84 --> 1892.52]  rockets yeah so taking the rocket laundry is like a huge ammo risk yeah just just just this huge there's
[1892.52 --> 1897.88]  huge downsides to it or whatever fine you know like find another way to fix the balance but be more
[1897.88 --> 1906.12]  creative than just hp go up hp go up yeah it's not fun yeah unless you're the kind of person who just
[1906.12 --> 1912.68]  really enjoys that in which case we want to hear from you i'm kidding i i don't yeah i was like uh
[1912.68 --> 1920.52]  no it's it's lazy no it's lazy design it's lazy design what are we talking about what topic are we on
[1920.52 --> 1927.40]  um capcom not seeing the value right yeah i think i think having original versions is cool
[1927.96 --> 1935.16]  for sure uh our discussion topic here from mr goff gohtier is why are some devs averse to
[1935.16 --> 1940.92]  re-releasing older games without touching them too much are they being lazy are they being cheap
[1941.48 --> 1947.32]  um are they scared the original is so janky it could scare off potential buyers that one i think
[1947.32 --> 1954.28]  i could see that one i think that's the main one i think if you're releasing this game on gog i think
[1954.28 --> 1959.48]  you're safe from that i think so too i mean that's that's what i think but you never know i mean brands
[1959.48 --> 1964.12]  are funny about their brands because when you launch that game it's still going to be a big giant
[1964.12 --> 1969.32]  capcom when you launch it and so if they're kind of sitting there going well i mean yeah we were pretty
[1969.32 --> 1977.24]  proud of that 25 years ago but the games industry has sort of moved on and i i could i could see people
[1977.24 --> 1982.92]  you know creating a negative association between our brand and this like frustrating janky experience i
[1982.92 --> 1993.40]  i i've heard i've heard dumber arguments around brand use yeah for sure i just think uh they also
[1993.40 --> 1997.40]  need to understand the positive association that would come with doing this and doing this the right
[1997.40 --> 2003.48]  way which i think i think is releasing it through gog i think they did do it the right way that positive
[2003.48 --> 2009.16]  association is to a completely different person though the positive association is with the nostalgia
[2009.16 --> 2014.60]  crowd or with the diehards who just you love the franchise and they want to go experience it the
[2014.60 --> 2020.52]  way that it was or something like that whereas if almost literally anyone else ended up with this
[2020.52 --> 2025.08]  game there's a really solid chance they wouldn't like it like i wouldn't have given my son original
[2025.08 --> 2033.16]  final fantasy tactics because it like didn't explain anything you just kind of get dumped into it you've
[2033.16 --> 2038.92]  no idea what to do it's super frustrating manual game was that like a yeah so like unless you have
[2039.16 --> 2044.36]  i mean you could like maybe find a pdf and print off a replacement or something but unless you have the
[2044.36 --> 2052.60]  manual it's not the same experience i think that's like surprisingly easy to forget it's like experiencing
[2052.60 --> 2054.28]  something from that long ago now
[2057.16 --> 2064.28]  is is difficult to truly make the same because you kind of need everything that came with experiencing
[2064.28 --> 2072.36]  that to experience it properly good old vims layer final fantasy tactics manual that's awesome actually
[2072.36 --> 2072.92]  here it is
[2077.72 --> 2087.64]  oh it's really slow cool that makes sense i wonder if a few people looked it up yep nice that's cool
[2087.64 --> 2097.08]  oh man manuals were pretty cool dude okay okay but like okay look at this look at this though like
[2097.08 --> 2105.80]  this is crazy in the new version they explain the importance of picking your zodiac sign like they they
[2105.80 --> 2114.12]  they explain it quite a bit here enter the adventure i don't know bruv just go for it after entering your
[2114.12 --> 2118.12]  character's name enter your birth date on the next screen in similar fashion using the start button to
[2118.12 --> 2123.48]  confirm your birth date will affect zodiac sign which has an influence on your character's performance
[2123.48 --> 2128.36]  during battles see page 10 but they're just like yeah just yeah go for it well what's on page 10 all
[2128.36 --> 2134.20]  right if it has a full matrix then i will be then i'll think it's okay
[2134.20 --> 2146.12]  uh yeah is this not page 10 because this looks like 10 10 but i don't think we've scrolled enough
[2146.12 --> 2148.92]  times for it to be page 10 uh
[2152.28 --> 2160.68]  yeah no not that useful cool the the vim thing says you're on page like seven now or something
[2160.68 --> 2169.08]  yeah we can three chat saying three but the corner said 10 yeah well cool chat saying three let's try
[2169.08 --> 2175.24]  three let's try three i'm gonna hear you out chat nope that's definitely not it all right i don't know
[2175.24 --> 2181.72]  what they mean by three neat how are they both missing three anyway the point is i have literally no idea
[2181.72 --> 2189.32]  what they're saying no it's a j as in jack i have actually no idea what they're saying j not three
[2189.32 --> 2197.48]  what does j mean j as in j oh like section j on page 10. oh oh oh okay here here here here
[2200.04 --> 2205.40]  yeah okay this symbol indicates the unit's zodiac sign if the unit attacks an enemy with
[2205.40 --> 2210.84]  a compatible sign damage will be increased uh if signs are incompatible damage is decreased press
[2210.84 --> 2214.60]  the select button during battle to bring up a help menu and check the zodiac sign compatibility okay
[2214.60 --> 2223.32]  okay you know what that that's actually pretty okay i will say though that this is a flippin
[2224.52 --> 2234.04]  this is dense this is not user friendly this is not for kids and this is just in some cases
[2234.04 --> 2239.16]  indicating where to go to bring up a help menu built within the game that is also
[2239.96 --> 2244.60]  not got the greatest translation you liked it is it not for kids or is it not for kids now
[2245.24 --> 2248.76]  i don't know and i don't know how i liked it i really
[2250.68 --> 2254.76]  like i'm thinking back to some of my first experiences playing this game like i didn't
[2254.76 --> 2260.28]  i didn't know how to change your i didn't even know how to learn ever is morrowind i didn't know it had a
[2260.28 --> 2267.32]  main quest yeah for months okay this is my morrowind yeah like i ended up against a brick wall in this game
[2267.32 --> 2272.84]  because i didn't actually twice within the first few battles because i didn't know how to learn
[2272.84 --> 2278.60]  additional abilities and i didn't know how to because i didn't have the manual actually i played
[2278.60 --> 2283.00]  it on an emulator for the first time so that's a big part of the reason that i bought this was
[2283.00 --> 2287.88]  because i like needed to give square soft square enix now but i needed to give the money for it at
[2287.88 --> 2294.84]  some point because i'd already played the game a few times um so i didn't have a manual so i didn't
[2294.84 --> 2299.40]  know that you could like learn new abilities and so i just got really frustrated because i kept coming
[2299.40 --> 2303.96]  up against tougher and tougher enemies that had all these like amazing abilities and they could do
[2303.96 --> 2312.20]  magic and and i'm like okay so when do i level up and then i didn't figure out changing jobs for a
[2312.20 --> 2317.72]  while either so i don't know how i figured out how to play this game to be honest with you because it's
[2317.72 --> 2326.12]  very deep very complicated i think sometimes that's what you want as a kid you think so you
[2326.12 --> 2336.44]  want to fight with something and like force learn it and impart your will onto it despite it being
[2336.44 --> 2342.28]  complicated and hard maybe part of it is just like having time at that stage in your life yeah you have
[2342.28 --> 2348.52]  tons of time you have all the time you need a good rioja in float plane chat says i played xcom
[2348.52 --> 2353.40]  apocalypse when i was eight and finished it i went back to it a few years ago i have no idea how i did
[2353.40 --> 2363.88]  that yeah but you have almost no responsibilities tons of time and yeah a desire to pick things apart
[2363.88 --> 2370.44]  and learn things that is like almost unparalleled i really didn't realize when i was in it how much
[2370.44 --> 2375.88]  free time i had when i was a kid like i felt like i did a lot of chores and honestly
[2377.80 --> 2384.04]  i did a fair amount of chores and stuff but it's the it's like the mental load i was never thinking
[2384.04 --> 2391.72]  about that stuff when i had my free time when i had my free time my brain completely switched over
[2392.44 --> 2397.32]  and i was free i remember thinking when i was a kid at one point in time that i was really excited to be
[2397.32 --> 2404.52]  an adult because then i wouldn't have homework therefore more time yeah homework is just practice
[2404.52 --> 2416.12]  for working at home and like at a at and and i fully understand that in a lot of work positions you can
[2416.12 --> 2423.08]  turn off being at work when you are not at work anymore i will say that once you are at you know
[2423.08 --> 2434.92]  director vp executive c-suite level most people i know they just effectively are working all the time
[2434.92 --> 2441.64]  yeah no it just doesn't like that no that's that's not how it works um yeah and ninja man away says yeah
[2441.64 --> 2447.64]  not in teaching lol yeah there's so there's lots of there's lots of jobs where um you do get kind of
[2447.64 --> 2455.96]  like the summer in teaching yes so i mean it depends um that's also fair not with your current
[2455.96 --> 2460.36]  wages because now you got to do summer school or some other job coming from a family of teachers i
[2460.36 --> 2467.40]  definitely have some thoughts on how educators compensation has scaled over my lifetime and
[2467.96 --> 2475.08]  i definitely know some educators with families who definitely do not have summers off because not
[2475.08 --> 2480.04]  because they have to teach at school but because they have to find some other job you know uh teach
[2480.04 --> 2489.80]  badminton classes or do something else so that's a whole separate conversation especially when we consider
[2489.80 --> 2498.52]  the importance of teachers role in society yeah um you should want them being pretty good you should
[2498.52 --> 2507.40]  really want them to be like awesome um especially when you consider how many things a teacher needs to
[2507.40 --> 2513.40]  be awesome at like they've got to teach yes well and you never know when you're getting like side
[2513.40 --> 2519.08]  swiped by some random question about something that isn't your field they need to be you know counselors
[2519.08 --> 2526.60]  sometimes they need to be suspect often mediators sometimes they're expected to be these like jack of all
[2526.60 --> 2531.08]  trades especially in elementary school they're expected to teach like every subject they have to be you
[2531.08 --> 2537.40]  know somewhat athletic so they can like teach pe but also they need to know math and english and
[2537.40 --> 2540.12]  everything else and yeah
[2543.48 --> 2551.80]  yeah uh next topic sure dan what do you want us to do because that's two main topics i mean we can move
[2551.80 --> 2559.08]  over to some cw announcements if dan you just tell us what to do i mean do we have a lot of topics
[2561.64 --> 2566.28]  yeah why not let's do the cw he's having a thing this is the man that is truly in charge
[2568.12 --> 2576.04]  yep he said cw in essence oh right i yeah uh he commanded i don't know where to find them jump in the
[2576.04 --> 2579.88]  middle i don't know where to find them in the middle dan i don't know how to do this show the
[2579.88 --> 2583.48]  middle they're at the very top yeah they're at the top dan oh because there's no main topics yeah
[2583.48 --> 2589.56]  we don't have main topics this week they're at the top cw announcements note oh my god what
[2590.12 --> 2595.32]  chad is making me very tired today no you just seem really tired today are you cranky you seem
[2595.32 --> 2603.88]  cranky and tired you've said that every week for so long well maybe you should especially this week
[2603.88 --> 2611.56]  maybe you should sleep a little more and eat a bit more my goodness are you very tired today i am
[2611.56 --> 2618.92]  a little tired my wrist is like demolished oh from your your project have you talked to them about
[2618.92 --> 2624.20]  that i'm trying to remember super extensively okay it's a little bit but do you want to talk about
[2624.20 --> 2628.04]  that you don't have to not particularly i don't think it's that interesting i mean it just kind of
[2628.04 --> 2633.40]  sucks it's kind of interesting i think it's interesting i why don't you tell the people
[2633.40 --> 2642.76]  about it okay um so my place uh as with basically every place you're gonna get most likely uh was
[2642.76 --> 2648.36]  purchased off of someone else in my situation that person passed away so it was an estate sale
[2648.84 --> 2655.24]  um the estate was dissolved shortly after the sale so there's nothing for us to go after but there was a
[2655.24 --> 2663.16]  bunch of undisclosed damage um that we learned through the strata uh i have been told that for
[2663.16 --> 2669.88]  americans that's the homeowners association uh hoa yep i don't know if that's true for apartments still
[2669.88 --> 2674.04]  or whatever i don't know i think it's kind of the same idea sure people generally know what an hoa is
[2674.04 --> 2680.12]  yeah we call it a strata it's that thing but for an apartment building or a condo building um i was
[2680.12 --> 2685.88]  informed through that that my unit had a bunch of leaks in it with the previous owner we thought
[2685.88 --> 2692.20]  that that was centralized to one location and that it was dealt with a while ago because we dealt with
[2692.20 --> 2700.12]  it a while ago turns out it was not because there was more than one set of leaks that happened we solved
[2700.12 --> 2705.24]  the one set of leaks that happened turns out there was a second set of leaks what about what about
[2705.24 --> 2711.16]  second we're pretty sure because they did tell us this much they told us to not use the dishwasher
[2711.16 --> 2716.52]  when we moved in because the seal was not good yeah we're pretty sure that they learned the seal was
[2716.52 --> 2723.88]  not good by it flooding the house nice and they didn't say that part um so how our unit works i'm
[2723.88 --> 2729.00]  going to use some i'm going to do some really good paint this is going to be amazing this is great uh
[2729.00 --> 2736.68]  jay fife in float plane chat goes hoas aka the league of extraordinary karens yeah it's crazy dude
[2736.68 --> 2743.64]  i wanted uh so we have a mini split in my unit so that's an air conditioner yeah and i wanted to have
[2744.28 --> 2753.88]  a second head so a second fan thing that makes it cold yeah sure uh and basically we wanted two rooms to
[2753.88 --> 2761.80]  be a seed instead of just one room uh and we were told no right because the unit that goes outside
[2761.80 --> 2765.80]  did you say it doesn't know oh you just switch back that makes sense the unit that goes outside
[2765.80 --> 2775.32]  is mounted like in a certain spot go away internet um and it would have had to move for reasons and been
[2775.32 --> 2781.64]  somewhere else and i demonstrated with art like decent art actually really how i would have made it like
[2781.64 --> 2788.44]  this no oh okay i'm just checking not bothersome to the other people right right right um and they
[2788.44 --> 2796.04]  still were just like nope no one else has done it and or can do it so you can't do it so my problem is
[2796.04 --> 2806.20]  that it feels like it feels like we have man this is this is going way off the rails now but i feel like
[2806.20 --> 2816.84]  we have a bit of a societal problem right now where saying no is easy yeah and problem solving is hard
[2818.20 --> 2826.20]  but saying no sucks and solving problem problem solving means that you have solved a problem
[2826.84 --> 2833.96]  and i i just i feel like somehow and and i've gone through this so i've gone through so much bureaucracy
[2833.96 --> 2842.28]  in the last 13 years running a business you just you just come up against bureaucracy as just part of
[2842.28 --> 2853.56]  your daily life and i i i i think that it has been the single most aging tiring
[2855.64 --> 2862.68]  just life draining part of being alive for the last 13 years it's like dealing with other annoying
[2862.68 --> 2869.80]  people well it's not it's not even that they're annoying right because they're not it annoyed they're not
[2871.40 --> 2880.92]  sure but they're not trying to be annoying they just it's it's through incompetence or laziness or apathy
[2881.64 --> 2889.64]  um sometimes stupidity they don't actually understand the question and then that that stupidity plus apathy is a
[2889.64 --> 2895.88]  really potent combination in a bureaucrat because they don't understand and they don't really care
[2895.88 --> 2906.36]  to understand um which is just it's a brick wall and uh and i just i i it it's it's at the point now
[2906.36 --> 2911.72]  where it's such an obstacle to getting anything done i mean look at how long it took us to get whale land
[2911.72 --> 2919.24]  done and that was with a lot of support and so i i want to take a moment to shout out the city of surrey
[2919.24 --> 2929.08]  actually because of the people there that were very helpful and helped us overcome the apathetic lazy
[2930.20 --> 2939.00]  sometimes seemingly malicious individuals that stood in the way um because it was fine to do whale land
[2939.00 --> 2944.52]  and we did a whale land the video is coming and it was great and it was fun it was awesome and it was a
[2944.52 --> 2950.44]  boon to the city so even with the mayor on board and the council on board and thinking this is a good idea
[2951.08 --> 2962.28]  just the amount of bureaucratic obstruction that could be put in place by by sometimes just one person
[2962.28 --> 2967.72]  from project to project right like you never know when bam it's gonna hit you and someone just
[2968.84 --> 2976.04]  had a bad day one day and said no and is a principled person who once they've decided something
[2977.16 --> 2985.40]  expects that that's just the decision now and it's like no is not going to work here like we we need a
[2985.40 --> 2989.88]  solution and you can either be part of the solution or you're an obstacle those are it's it's kind of
[2989.88 --> 2999.48]  binary here um anyway what i'm trying to say is that's horrible and it's like it's not the end of
[2999.48 --> 3004.60]  the world okay so what luke can't have two heads on his mini split he's not going to die it's not that
[3004.60 --> 3011.40]  kind of horrible but it's just it's draining i mean it drains your life force there's there is a problem
[3011.40 --> 3016.28]  in my unit where yeah the building that we're in and i'll say this bit because i know other buildings
[3016.28 --> 3021.32]  have this problem it's in bc i think it's bc law i could be wrong i don't know you're not allowed to
[3021.32 --> 3028.92]  smoke within a certain amount of feet of buildings yeah but because air quality etc our building has
[3028.92 --> 3036.76]  allowed smoking on your like balcony thing right so genuinely if we have any window open if the sliding
[3036.76 --> 3045.88]  doors open anything for any amount of time like i mean at four in the morning it doesn't matter any time
[3046.28 --> 3052.36]  just i don't know if it's how like things are shaped or what but like all of it seems to flow
[3052.36 --> 3058.68]  directly into our unit it's crazy i was gonna i was gonna this is i was going to the bathroom yesterday
[3058.68 --> 3064.76]  and i yelled out to emma being like i feel like i'm literally smoking weed right now because like
[3064.76 --> 3070.52]  there was so moat so much secondhand smoke coming into our unit so that's why you're so sleepy maybe
[3070.52 --> 3075.88]  maybe you're just still actually maybe i'm still high yeah no i don't think so but i was gonna do the
[3075.88 --> 3083.80]  the way i'm sure but then i got high i didn't mean to but then i got high um yeah i know it's it's
[3083.80 --> 3091.64]  it's terrible so we don't want like i even tried i built this like insulated box thing i don't know
[3091.64 --> 3098.04]  if you've even seen it but maybe uh rock wall inside of a wooden long tall wooden vertical box
[3098.04 --> 3104.28]  that i put in the sliding glass door that you can even move the latch from the the wall to this box you
[3104.28 --> 3110.68]  can latch the door on it and then feed through an ac tube for like a rollable ac thing it still leaks
[3110.68 --> 3114.84]  a little bit too much you can get smoke in the house and i won't die from it i'll be fine the
[3114.84 --> 3119.96]  birds will yep so it's like ah so we want another mini split one of the greatest things about this
[3119.96 --> 3124.52]  whole thing is one of the key people that was arguing against letting me do it was complaining
[3124.52 --> 3131.32]  not that long ago about how hot the main area in their unit is which is the exact area that i was
[3131.32 --> 3137.16]  trying to add an ac head to because none of the units our entire building have any ac in that room
[3137.16 --> 3141.88]  and the only window in that room for our entire building is the sliding glass doors
[3141.88 --> 3143.64]  so there is not an easy way to do it
[3146.28 --> 3152.68]  you idiot like i can't ah it's so annoying well luke
[3152.68 --> 3159.48]  at least it's very rare for people to vote against their own self-interest
[3165.64 --> 3169.16]  at least it doesn't happen very often
[3173.00 --> 3177.96]  okay well my amazing art is done and this isn't going to make any sense so let me let me explain it
[3177.96 --> 3187.16]  so uh this area here is say an apartment um that is built like mine and i'm probably going to get
[3187.16 --> 3193.48]  things screwed up sorry tradies in the chat the black outline lines are walls all of these walls
[3193.48 --> 3198.52]  including there's this like there's a room here and let's say there's a door right there all of these
[3198.52 --> 3205.56]  walls including this wall in between there's this gap this display that i have on the on the left here so
[3205.56 --> 3210.68]  the right hand side is lightweight concrete so the whole unit that we're on all the individual rooms
[3210.68 --> 3216.92]  have their own slab of lightweight concrete yep and then there's a gap which is half an inch wide two
[3216.92 --> 3224.92]  and a half inches deep roughly very roughly the amount wide changes quite a bit as you go along but it's
[3224.92 --> 3232.20]  roughly half an inch wide and fairly accurately two and a half inches deep on the other side of that is a
[3232.20 --> 3239.32]  piece of wood uh this black bar in the middle is expansion joint material and then the red thing
[3240.36 --> 3246.36]  decently deeply down but in there is a nail because they nail the expansion joint material to the wood
[3246.36 --> 3250.36]  and then they pour the lightweight concrete the lightweight concrete goes directly against the
[3250.36 --> 3260.20]  expansion joint material and kind of fuses to it um so the first task that we had was opening all the drywall so that we could access this trench
[3260.20 --> 3266.92]  and then we had to uh exacto knife down each side because the cement would kind of fuse with it and
[3267.96 --> 3272.36]  the wood side wouldn't fuse with it too much except there is supposed to be adhesive on that side
[3272.36 --> 3276.92]  so you'd have to cut through the adhesive on one side and then cut through the the concrete cement
[3276.92 --> 3281.72]  whatever fusing on the other side and then it would be fused to the bottom often as well
[3282.44 --> 3288.12]  but if you released both the sides you could like pry it out with this weird thing that i would do with a knife
[3288.12 --> 3295.88]  knife um which was strenuous and tiring but eventually we got the whole place done and then
[3295.88 --> 3305.96]  we had to put closed cell foam backer rod so high density closed cell foam and then like tubes basically
[3305.96 --> 3310.44]  sure and we had to shove those in the hole the reason why we had to do that is because the like
[3310.44 --> 3319.80]  real solution isn't acquirable by normies oh i hate that when you're not allowed to buy the proper thing
[3319.80 --> 3328.04]  because you did a ton of research on this called up repair shops um there's a place in ontario that was
[3328.04 --> 3334.20]  like considering shipping it to us and like giving me a contractor number temporarily yeah i was gonna
[3334.20 --> 3339.72]  say usually you can like when i when i was trying to get paint for my bike you just have to find a
[3339.72 --> 3344.68]  place that there was a couple places locally that were unwilling to do it oh that's a bummer i think
[3344.68 --> 3350.04]  mostly because i i think they didn't have it on hand so they're gonna have to like order stuff in and
[3350.04 --> 3355.48]  they didn't want to order stuff in for me if i wasn't like a contractor bro but um this other place
[3355.48 --> 3361.08]  i think had it on hand so they were like we don't love this but we can ship it to you the problem was it
[3361.08 --> 3367.08]  wasn't going to get it to us in time so we we came with this backer rod solution okay we checked
[3367.08 --> 3373.24]  it with a few people they said it should be fine um it will help with the whole expansion situation
[3373.24 --> 3379.32]  right um but it's it's not perfect but it's pretty good yeah we could do it in time so it sounds good
[3379.32 --> 3386.36]  but i had to shove this backer rod which is oversized yeah and a circle into this rectangular
[3386.36 --> 3390.84]  trench and i had to shove it all the way down into the trench literally round peg square hole
[3390.84 --> 3395.96]  yeah and then and then i had to do another one because you wanted to pretty much fill this trench
[3395.96 --> 3401.56]  yeah you can't have an air gap in there ideally no so i have to put at least two the most i ever had
[3401.56 --> 3407.40]  to do was four but almost all the time it was two like over 90 of the time it was two yeah okay um and
[3407.40 --> 3413.08]  and i had to shove it in like that and i had to do the entire house and it's like very difficult to get
[3413.08 --> 3417.72]  in there usually unless the trench gets really wide for a second and then it just plops right in right
[3417.72 --> 3423.56]  but usually it's pretty hard to get in there so for double digit amount of hours i was basically
[3423.56 --> 3428.92]  shoving as hard as i could like this with my hands down into the trench right and mostly with my right
[3428.92 --> 3434.04]  one because more coordinated and stronger and i just torched the tendons of my wrist it is
[3437.16 --> 3444.92]  uh yeah so i don't know i went to physio um and he said that like the strength is still there and
[3444.92 --> 3451.32]  things are generally fine um like i can move like this right and i can move like that right and i can
[3451.32 --> 3459.56]  move like this yep but if i made a fist and then pulled it in it hurts a lot right right um so no doing
[3459.56 --> 3468.04]  that for a week a week and a half somewhere around there okay but you're done anyway right yeah pretty
[3468.04 --> 3477.32]  much so the that stuff is oh yeah ouch that wasn't great um podcast injury i'm trying to gesture and i
[3477.32 --> 3485.96]  just oh doing doing that stuff oh right what i was going to say the the i didn't explain this part so
[3485.96 --> 3491.16]  the flooding that probably happened from the dishwasher but we don't know wasn't a crazy amount
[3491.16 --> 3497.16]  of water so it didn't like seep into the floor or get under the floor but it flowed enough that it
[3497.16 --> 3503.96]  poured over into these trenches basically around the entire place yeah and rotted out all this
[3503.96 --> 3507.80]  expansion joint material yeah so there was a little bit of mold but it was mostly just a ton
[3507.80 --> 3513.96]  of rotten material a wrist brace might be helpful uh yeah i got one um physio guy said to not wear it
[3513.96 --> 3518.68]  all the time because i'm supposed to actually use it i'm supposed to move it right like i was doing
[3518.68 --> 3523.88]  this earlier in the show i'm supposed to do this right where i i was wondering what you were doing yeah
[3523.88 --> 3528.60]  yeah so i'm doing the little exercises like oh that's weird i'm a good boy with the physio exercises
[3528.60 --> 3533.72]  i actually do them that's good yeah uh so i have other ones that i'm supposed to do as well so i'll
[3533.72 --> 3539.48]  make sure i'm keeping on top of those uh but yeah the expansion material was rotten um and that was bad
[3539.48 --> 3545.64]  for a few reasons one of them was because it was promoting mold growth yeah so it looked black it was not
[3545.64 --> 3551.56]  black mold we got it tested there was no black mold oh there was actually like white mold and some other
[3551.56 --> 3559.72]  stuff okay it wasn't good but it wasn't like oh god evacuate the house immediately bad okay um so but
[3559.72 --> 3564.36]  we didn't want it to get there so get the rotten material out get new stuff in do you have an eta for
[3564.36 --> 3568.60]  when your place is livable again livable to the point where i don't have to sleep with my parents
[3568.60 --> 3576.52]  is hopefully monday really yeah so so the progress is since then drywall is back up yeah so the the
[3576.52 --> 3582.92]  holes were bad material taken out good material putting in putting in put in um and then the drywall
[3582.92 --> 3588.60]  was put back to like seal it and then we have someone helping with the finishing so mudding and
[3588.60 --> 3594.52]  sanding and all that kind of stuff and that is like almost done he thinks he'll be done by saturday
[3595.24 --> 3601.40]  and then we're hoping to paint two rooms the two rooms that would have carpet in it and then carpet
[3601.40 --> 3607.64]  people are coming in monday nice and then we'd be able to like put the bed back nice and i could
[3607.64 --> 3614.04]  set up a desk nice some basic stuff like that and that would be like a enormous improvement i noticed
[3614.04 --> 3619.32]  today on steam because a buddy sent me a steam key for a game that he's working on i haven't launched
[3619.32 --> 3626.12]  a game on steam since the 18th of last month yeah which is like a month i was i was telling emma i think
[3626.12 --> 3632.76]  this is the longest i've gone without using a desktop of my own since i was probably like eight
[3634.36 --> 3641.08]  that actually makes sense it's been like a month and a half like the last thing i launched on steam
[3641.08 --> 3644.92]  wasn't even on my desktop right i was on a trip and i think i launched like slay the spire or something
[3645.96 --> 3653.88]  like it's been a long time adulting yeah just wow all right yeah um
[3653.88 --> 3661.80]  um so yeah i missed this are you just helping but your land no i own the place um which is like
[3662.28 --> 3672.60]  cool and also totally sucks yeah it's a funny assumption that like luke is poor he's just cheap
[3674.12 --> 3680.44]  it is a really really big difference i think other people have problems with spending money i don't think
[3680.44 --> 3683.40]  i'm cheap okay
[3690.28 --> 3696.92]  i think because luke identifies as poor no i don't know he doesn't i really don't he really doesn't i
[3696.92 --> 3706.04]  don't i don't actually understand where this comes from but there is a not insignificant amount of the
[3706.04 --> 3714.04]  ltd community that like thinks luke is poor yeah frugal yeah i prefer frugal some people in the there
[3714.04 --> 3718.84]  was a there was a lmg clip on this recently and a bunch of people in the comments are saying it's
[3718.84 --> 3727.56]  it's frugal no he's not a miser either because luke spends money on other people he just doesn't he doesn't
[3727.56 --> 3736.84]  spend money on the kinds of things that it feels like our society encourages us to spend money on
[3736.84 --> 3746.44]  i don't care about a lot of those things no i i i get it i i totally get it i just uh
[3747.16 --> 3753.56]  it it just it yeah yeah yeah and like someone in chat says luke is just smart with his money i don't even want to take that necessarily
[3753.56 --> 3759.96]  yeah i don't actually think that that's quite the case either because if luke was smart with his money
[3759.96 --> 3763.80]  there's a lot of okay how do i say this
[3766.68 --> 3767.08]  there's
[3770.12 --> 3774.60]  i know how much money luke makes and i know how much he spends
[3774.60 --> 3782.68]  and because we're also friends in addition to me being his employer and so therefore knowing how much
[3782.68 --> 3791.32]  money he makes i know how little work his capital is doing for him yeah yeah there are some reasons i i i
[3791.32 --> 3800.68]  know i know and that's and that's totally valid um however i i the hmm i
[3800.68 --> 3809.64]  okay and the thing is in some ways i'm just as bad as him like both of us i would argue worse because
[3809.64 --> 3816.20]  you don't have the same limitations both of us have completely missed out on like this recent stock
[3816.20 --> 3820.92]  market bull run oh yeah for instance oh yeah i just want to disclaim all of this you know not this
[3820.92 --> 3827.80]  none of this is financial advice this is not financial advice um so you know right but there's been
[3827.80 --> 3834.76]  like an incredible you know stock bull market for for an extended period of time here and there's been
[3834.76 --> 3843.40]  some fairly obvious plays um but you know because of our position as tech influencers and because of
[3844.44 --> 3851.32]  i don't want to be invested in an nvidia i think we i think that would be bad i think we both also
[3851.32 --> 3861.16]  tend to have a bit of a bit of a one in the hand versus two in the bush sort of mentality i think that
[3861.80 --> 3870.28]  um part of it is is is just i think part of it is growing up poor um like growing up without money and
[3871.00 --> 3880.28]  yeah yeah and i i think people i tell that story that was a relatively short period of my upbringing we
[3880.28 --> 3888.04]  were fine most of the time but like that bit was at a formative time and made me think about money in
[3888.04 --> 3893.96]  a certain way like i mean i not long after that time i blew everything i had on a computer like
[3894.84 --> 3901.88]  and and we were both let's be real we were both young dudes you know and and definitely wasted money
[3901.88 --> 3909.40]  on things like let's let's be very clear but i think that in general like we both experienced times
[3910.20 --> 3917.56]  when there was real scarcity yeah i guess that would be the best way to to kind of describe it because
[3918.28 --> 3925.40]  like i was never on the verge of complete homelessness or anything like that but there were definitely
[3926.36 --> 3933.00]  there were times of there were tighter times yeah yeah yeah and so recognizing the very real possibility
[3933.00 --> 3940.76]  that like money could be gone and and there would not be any more coming uh i think put both of us in a
[3940.76 --> 3949.16]  position where what you have in the bank um seems a lot more important than what you could get out there
[3949.16 --> 3954.36]  if you if you like deployed it if you took it out of the bank and with inflation going the way that it is
[3954.36 --> 3962.20]  like the money that we've had sitting in the bank has been rotted yeah like to a degree that makes me
[3963.24 --> 3967.48]  genuinely pretty uncomfortable to think about like how much of it has just
[3968.92 --> 3977.96]  rotted yeah um like man it's it's i i still like i i went through a period for a bit sorry one second i
[3977.96 --> 3982.84]  just want to address this really quickly yeah mcbane said regarding investing in nvidia better me have the
[3982.84 --> 3990.12]  money than somebody else yeah but like i do stuff with the lab yeah it's just not i don't want to be
[3990.12 --> 3996.68]  invested in nvidia yeah it just i don't want that uh not that i don't think i could handle
[3997.96 --> 4001.72]  that like potential conflicting interest thing i don't think that would be a problem for me at all
[4001.72 --> 4008.28]  to be completely honest but i just don't even want anyone thinking it i'm just not gonna mess around
[4008.28 --> 4013.96]  with that apparently this is a whole thing the psychology of scarcity uh explores how deprivation
[4013.96 --> 4020.28]  wreaks havoc on cognition and decision making being poor requires so much mental energy that those with
[4020.28 --> 4025.64]  limited means be they sugarcane farmers in india or new jersey mall goers are more likely to make mistakes
[4025.64 --> 4031.24]  and bad decisions than those with bigger financial cushions that actually makes a ton of sense i think
[4031.24 --> 4037.80]  there's also like i don't know there's comfort levels i don't necessarily think that being a
[4037.80 --> 4044.28]  risk averse is a bad decision i don't think that maximizing the potential value play over under on
[4044.28 --> 4051.24]  every dollar that you have is necessary no no i don't i don't think it's necessary and the comfort
[4051.24 --> 4055.00]  and like no i should be doing more with my stuff for sure there's certain limitations whatever we don't
[4055.00 --> 4064.44]  need to get into that um there too but uh assuming i did do some of it i still wouldn't do a ton
[4065.00 --> 4072.52]  yeah because the comfort of just i'm good is like really nice and i i see value in that and i don't
[4072.52 --> 4081.40]  only see value in dollar numbers which i uh some people do and i don't see it that way i see like
[4081.40 --> 4087.00]  comfort lack of concern not needing to check the stock market twice a day every day all the time
[4087.64 --> 4092.44]  those types of things is like it's kind of nice like i remember i knew some people that made a
[4092.44 --> 4099.08]  lot of money off of crypto i had also remember hanging out with those people it's it was all that
[4099.08 --> 4105.16]  i think bro when it was going up it was all i could think about and when it was going down it was like
[4105.16 --> 4110.44]  super all i could think about yeah and i wasn't even in super heavy or anything we were just talking we
[4110.44 --> 4114.60]  were just it was perfect actually we were just talking about playing games when you're younger
[4114.60 --> 4120.92]  and how you can like actually just think about the game yeah like no not anymore not if you're
[4120.92 --> 4126.60]  leveraged into something not if your livelihood and you're like eating next month relies on some
[4126.60 --> 4133.08]  some relies on a game you're playing yeah um relies on like somebody associated to the company that
[4133.08 --> 4140.28]  you're invested in not saying something crazy yeah or doing whatever or saying something crazy and
[4140.28 --> 4146.92]  mooning anyway sure whatever right yeah because i gotta say man this the stock market feels more just
[4147.64 --> 4152.36]  meme stocks and gambling than ever and that's something that we've talked about extensively on
[4152.36 --> 4160.36]  the show how it just feels like gambling right now um asian says that gold xbox controller though okay
[4160.36 --> 4166.44]  that was a that was a calculated risk probably made money it was an amount that i was very comfortable
[4167.08 --> 4173.16]  you know depreciating a little bit and oh yes it's definitely made money yeah
[4174.04 --> 4180.44]  well what would you look up gold index or what uh goldprice.org is the is the best one that i've found
[4183.48 --> 4188.68]  oh yeah i guess we could do that uh these are one days let's look at how long do you think it's been
[4188.68 --> 4197.56]  five years uh when did yeah when did we uh make the gold oh that's silver uh hold on five years
[4201.72 --> 4206.76]  hold on when did we make the gold controller four years ago yeah so five years is the closest i can
[4206.76 --> 4211.48]  get because it's it's one and then five or one two five yeah i think the gold controller did okay
[4211.48 --> 4219.48]  uh it was like over doubled in value yeah i think well we spent like 20 grand on the like
[4220.04 --> 4225.72]  craftsmanship of it or something like that 15 something it was it was like many many many many
[4225.72 --> 4231.80]  that in labor hours how much was the value of just the gold uh disclosed i don't remember i think it's
[4231.80 --> 4237.56]  in the video but i don't remember the exact i don't remember how many ounces sure went into it yeah um that
[4237.56 --> 4246.84]  was like kind of a a minor detail in my mind um you know what they ended up uh certain people in
[4246.84 --> 4250.84]  chatter like si this is why you have a financial advisor company yeah and a lot of them would say
[4250.84 --> 4256.20]  just invest everything in big seven and i would not want to do that oh dude i would like that it's
[4256.20 --> 4262.84]  not it's not a automatic solve all i'd be terrified yeah i'd be terrified to throw everything
[4262.84 --> 4268.44]  into magnificent seven right now and this is not financial advice of them are that is a thing
[4268.44 --> 4273.48]  this is not financial advice you're making assumptions i'm literally not i know people
[4273.48 --> 4277.96]  that have done this because of financial advisors i'm actually not making an assumption i was actually
[4277.96 --> 4286.04]  chatting with ceo uh mr taron tong uh the other day and um we were i was sending him this article uh
[4286.04 --> 4291.80]  research by mark zandy the chief economist of moody's analytics showed earlier in this year
[4291.80 --> 4299.16]  and again recently that the top 10 percent of earners in the u.s are responsible for just under 50
[4299.96 --> 4303.56]  of all consumer spending like
[4306.28 --> 4312.44]  i've been trying to wrap my brain around this for a little while how ltt store sales investing
[4314.60 --> 4320.36]  chats driving me insane today no they do the investing that doesn't change anything if that's
[4320.36 --> 4323.64]  what they're just going to do that doesn't change anything yeah there's also a problem right now
[4323.64 --> 4328.76]  where you invest you might be investing in companies that are cyclically invested in the big seven
[4328.76 --> 4336.28]  so it's like it doesn't even really matter like it's there are absolutely ways to do it properly
[4336.28 --> 4342.28]  it well properly um and there are ways that i would be more down with and there are advisors that
[4342.28 --> 4346.28]  will think more the way that i would like to think and you can also explain to them that you want
[4346.28 --> 4349.80]  to approach it a certain way and they might do it in that way and that's cool and there's also
[4349.80 --> 4353.32]  fees that come along with that and that might be bad and who knows and whatever and it doesn't matter
[4353.32 --> 4358.44]  go away ninja man away not the right people to talk to about this it's weird to see linus be the
[4358.44 --> 4364.68]  calm one and luke getting angry at the chat i told you he's grumpy today he's tired having it
[4364.68 --> 4370.60]  you get some rest guy yeah it's fine he's good uh so what i was gonna so right i've been trying to wrap
[4370.60 --> 4377.56]  my brain around like how things are pretty pretty tough right now in general like you've got you
[4377.56 --> 4384.28]  know dollar giant mooning because way more people are shopping at the dollar store which by the way
[4384.28 --> 4389.40]  there is nothing wrong with shopping at the dollar store one of my kids made an offhand comment about
[4389.40 --> 4395.32]  like shopping at the dollar store or something like that or where were we no we weren't at the dollar
[4395.32 --> 4401.72]  store we were yeah no we weren't at the dollar store but we were somewhere and we were at walmart
[4401.72 --> 4409.00]  that's right we were at walmart because um i i promised her like a daddy-daughter day and um she
[4409.00 --> 4413.96]  she could pick any activity she wanted and she wanted to make slime so uh walmart is the place that
[4413.96 --> 4418.84]  i know that i can get boxes of borax because superstore doesn't carry it or they didn't the last time i
[4418.84 --> 4423.24]  checked and i didn't feel like going to a dozen different places so uh we went to walmart so we picked up
[4423.24 --> 4428.36]  some borax some white glue um and we didn't need food coloring we already had that the point is you
[4428.36 --> 4431.96]  don't care about the ingredients the slime you care about the story maybe or you don't i don't know
[4431.96 --> 4437.96]  you're watching one show so who knows um the point is that we were there and she wanted to get something
[4437.96 --> 4442.36]  i forget what it was but it was something that i basically was like no we'd be better off getting
[4442.36 --> 4446.20]  that at the dollar store and she goes well wouldn't it be a worse one and i go whoa hold on
[4446.20 --> 4453.80]  no the place that you buy something does not indicate the quality of it you can buy campbell's
[4453.80 --> 4459.64]  soup at the dollar store or you can buy campbell's soup at some bougie supermarket and they are the
[4459.64 --> 4465.24]  exact same thing as long as oh okay campbell's soup is canned so i wouldn't even worry about the expiry
[4465.24 --> 4469.64]  date like sometimes you can get food stuffs that are closer to the expiry date at the dollar store so
[4469.64 --> 4475.88]  you do kind of have to watch for that but if it is the same product then no you just get it wherever
[4475.88 --> 4483.56]  you get the best deal there is no there's no better status in buying something at a fancier store and
[4483.56 --> 4488.28]  paying more for it it's just not something that i'm ever going to believe in um
[4490.92 --> 4494.36]  how did i get on this topic again can't remember
[4494.36 --> 4501.00]  no not what was before that chat might remember
[4503.48 --> 4509.72]  yes uh top 10 percent of earners spend 15 percent of 50 percent of consumers right right right right
[4509.72 --> 4513.56]  so i was talking about dollar giant so dollar giant is like doing great because more and more people
[4513.56 --> 4518.04]  are resorting to shopping at the dollar store which i just wanted to make clear is not a problem
[4518.04 --> 4523.96]  shopping at the dollar store is totally fine uh but for a lot of people where they shop is part of
[4523.96 --> 4529.96]  their self-worth equation i suppose and so they're you know they only shop at the dollar store during
[4529.96 --> 4534.92]  hard times apparently i'm like okay sure whatever um i will never be too cool to shop at the dollar
[4534.92 --> 4541.08]  store i give you my personal linus tech tips guarantee of that um and so i've been trying to figure out okay
[4541.64 --> 4549.88]  so with things being tough and they're being all of these indicators right that things are tough
[4549.88 --> 4556.92]  i've been trying to figure out why like ltt store sales are not falling like why ltt store is still doing
[4556.92 --> 4568.60]  fine and so i saw this and i was like holy crap i had no idea how one-sided it was i didn't realize
[4568.60 --> 4576.12]  consumer spending would track that way oh like like like that much though that's that's wild anyway so he
[4576.12 --> 4586.36]  countered with s p 500 is basically s p 10 because the top 10 companies are about 40 of the value and
[4586.36 --> 4593.80]  have been responsible for 70 of the index growth so when you so i i had a i had a i had kind of a
[4593.80 --> 4598.68]  an annoying conversation well i shouldn't say annoying conversation with yvonne because she was just the
[4598.68 --> 4605.64]  messenger but i was annoyed about a conversation i was having with yvonne because um she was talking about
[4605.64 --> 4613.16]  some investment service or something and uh she basically goes yeah so like they just recommend
[4613.16 --> 4622.12]  like this s p thing and i go okay that's fine um but there are a handful of companies in the s p that i
[4622.12 --> 4631.72]  think are just ludicrously like overvalued bubble the fundamentals of this company make absolutely no
[4631.72 --> 4638.52]  sense one of the ones that i'll that i'll name is tesla i think tesla's valuation is just bat crazy
[4638.52 --> 4646.04]  right now um they are really struggling to sell cars that is only going to get worse as the u.s subsidies
[4646.04 --> 4653.64]  go away as the chinese market just effective like dumping from domestic chinese companies continues
[4654.44 --> 4660.20]  and as they continue to struggle to compete in europe like it is it is not looking good for tesla's car
[4660.20 --> 4667.72]  business and sure fine tesla's an ai company or something and they make humanoid robots but like
[4669.88 --> 4677.80]  sorry what is optimus's compete level like right now bad and what is the indication that that will get
[4677.80 --> 4688.36]  better nothing not much uh okay sure and then the whole ai thing right so tesla is a super duper d duper
[4688.36 --> 4697.08]  ai company but also you know when they're supposed to get ge sorry ge's when they're supposed to get gpus
[4697.08 --> 4703.80]  they just get sort of unilaterally redirected to other companies like you know xai that are also you know
[4703.80 --> 4710.44]  predominantly owned by overlapping ownership groups like the the whole thing is just a complete smoke
[4710.44 --> 4716.12]  and mirror show and so i wanted absolutely no exposure to it and they basically the response
[4716.12 --> 4722.12]  is just like well we don't do that and i go okay well then i don't do whatever your thing is um
[4723.72 --> 4729.24]  because i don't want any exposure to that and that was even before i realized just how bad it is
[4729.24 --> 4738.76]  the top 10 companies 40 of the value 70 of the growth so this like bull run that's taken place
[4738.76 --> 4746.04]  over the last little while here has been driven by predominantly the the ai and their and their
[4746.04 --> 4751.72]  cyclical investing as well to be clear i did not just call it the ai i was going to say the ai bubble
[4751.72 --> 4756.36]  but i wasn't sure if i wanted to use the b word sure but there's the like it seems like a bubble
[4756.36 --> 4761.72]  not investment advice x amount of money goes from open ai to oracle x amount of money goes from oracle
[4761.72 --> 4767.32]  to nvidia oh x amount of money goes from nvidia to open ai dude big circle thing this is also not the
[4767.32 --> 4774.52]  first time we've seen this happen um i saw the funniest bring it back on uh here this is this is
[4774.52 --> 4779.80]  amazing dan i'm sending this to you to bring up on the show dude you're gonna you're gonna freaking
[4779.80 --> 4787.72]  love this where is dan like there's also the like the the i think fairly old school like i'm gonna
[4787.72 --> 4793.16]  get the numbers wrong but i think it's like 20 per sector maximum five percent per company maximum if
[4793.16 --> 4800.12]  it goes above any of that sell it off until it gets down to that number blah blah blah blah thing
[4800.12 --> 4805.80]  and that's all cool but there's unless you're watching it decently close i think there's issues
[4805.80 --> 4809.00]  with that because of like what i was mentioning earlier where all these companies are kind of tied
[4809.00 --> 4814.20]  into each other in a variety of different ways uh no i want you to throw it up on screen
[4815.88 --> 4822.44]  yeah just get get me that photo carousel because luke you're gonna love this um this is a meme that i
[4822.44 --> 4829.40]  caught over on wall street bets uh earlier today this card game would be lit um dan you ready
[4829.40 --> 4838.92]  uh that's fine just just throw up the page it doesn't really matter he's doing it he's doing it
[4838.92 --> 4843.64]  he's got this this actually made me laugh out loud and then i showed it to a couple of other people on
[4843.64 --> 4851.80]  set and they actually lol um it's a big problem right now oh dude it's a huge dude it's wild there is a
[4851.80 --> 4857.00]  money sink happening because there's a little bit of loss every time that moves around no it gains it
[4857.00 --> 4862.28]  multiplies every time it moves around as far as i can tell because it pulls out from investors
[4863.24 --> 4868.60]  yeah yeah yeah yeah hit it love this uh you might have to zoom it a bit so we can see the cards
[4868.60 --> 4872.04]  i see where this is going
[4876.76 --> 4881.96]  no no give us more time give us more time luke doesn't read so fast yeah i did read this but
[4882.84 --> 4890.20]  yeah that is a problem economic ouroboros i love it fantastic okay next oh man
[4890.20 --> 4905.40]  it's jim kramer legendary creature human do opposite that's fantastic power zero wisdom minus two
[4905.40 --> 4914.52]  charisma nine very loud seconds before it crashes the stock is go to the mood that's great oh man
[4914.52 --> 4925.00]  oh man yeah yeah yeah hit me immediately halves your portfolio oh man that's pretty good it's like
[4926.12 --> 4932.28]  i uh i i absolutely love this subreddit not because i actually want to invest any of my money in
[4932.28 --> 4939.96]  anything right now uh the oh the one that's missing is uh nana's inheritance so we've got ghost grandma uh
[4939.96 --> 4945.16]  forces player to buy overvalued stock no reduces total value of portfolio by 30 percent
[4947.64 --> 4953.08]  oh oh man oh man this has been this has been active all day there's a jerome powell card now
[4953.08 --> 4961.64]  ability money printer go burr um effect bag holder targets opponent gains unmarketable assets
[4963.00 --> 4965.48]  transitory all effects are temporary maybe
[4965.48 --> 4977.40]  oh man okay anyway that's a wild world right now that legitimately sounds like an outstanding card
[4977.40 --> 4977.72]  game
[4980.12 --> 4984.44]  but just like it'd be like the calvin ball of card games because i just feel like there'd be no rules
[4984.44 --> 4991.80]  and nobody wins you know you could totally make that game work maybe i think you i think you could you
[4991.80 --> 4998.44]  think so like so like a finance a finance deck builder game i think you could it's so funny i i
[4998.44 --> 5006.12]  guarantee you like all this is just like ai generated like slop but that doesn't change that it's super
[5006.12 --> 5012.20]  funny you know that might do pretty okay if you if you make it right now it's so topical oh my god
[5012.20 --> 5017.80]  there's so many more cards than when i looked at it earlier uh luigi time trap card
[5017.80 --> 5022.12]  the target stock loses half its value when activated
[5031.72 --> 5040.04]  oh man i do want to take a moment in spite of the fact that he's laughing to point out that murder is
[5040.04 --> 5045.00]  not an answer okay that's an important thing for us to get out there
[5049.72 --> 5054.84]  merch messages sure is that what we're supposed to be doing i think that no this is going to be my
[5054.84 --> 5059.64]  this is going to be my third or fourth attempt at starting the creator warehouse announcement yes
[5059.64 --> 5067.24]  note samples of underwear and pet bandanas are on the table and an example of a utility shirt is
[5067.24 --> 5075.56]  hanging on the right of line behind your behind your and then the one on the far right i think oh what
[5075.56 --> 5085.16]  are we launching this much stuff today i have no idea okay i get uh okay uh first up back by popular
[5085.16 --> 5093.64]  demand do you want to bring up the site um sure site while i do the thing uh whoops we have too many
[5093.64 --> 5100.76]  websites to start with ltd yeah sorry about that uh luke laptop ready yeah luke laptop re-air uh so

[5127.56 --> 5136.36]  completely legally distinct from any other cards because these ones only say ltt on them yes totally
[5136.36 --> 5144.28]  different cards unrelated to any other cards yep we also have hasta la vista which i'm wearing oh that's
[5144.28 --> 5151.96]  pretty good i didn't actually recognize what this was that totally makes sense though and finally we have

[5225.40 --> 5235.40]  it's so cute that's pretty great gotta love it um and you have more a lot of y'all have been waiting
[5235.40 --> 5244.84]  for this announcement we are finally bringing back ldt underwear it's underwear so soft and comfy that
[5244.84 --> 5253.56]  you'll be getting people talking about it on facebook what oh yeah yeah yeah this is old it's 2023 i think we
[5253.56 --> 5257.96]  talked about this on the show back then i forgot about that yeah yeah yeah that is hilarious yeah

[5272.76 --> 5286.20]  make sure i get this right a 47.5 percent model 47.5 cotton 5 elastane blend for a great balance of
[5287.16 --> 5295.00]  hand feel well i mean butt feel you know how it is but and other stuff um and stretchability and other
[5295.00 --> 5304.28]  stuff structure and what you only what other stuff only butt stuff no other stuff is that no i was
[5304.28 --> 5310.84]  looking for you to uh to explain ah yes and oh this is a really handy feature that we actually i don't
[5310.84 --> 5317.08]  think even like mention the ltt logo on here is like kind of a little like kind of grippy thing yep
[5317.08 --> 5323.00]  and in the morning when your eyes are not open yet it's a great way to landmark and orient the
[5323.00 --> 5326.76]  underwear it's fantastic put them on the right way around yep uh
[5329.24 --> 5332.04]  anywho we've also got the boulder pack
[5333.88 --> 5337.32]  it rocks but it's not socks
[5342.92 --> 5349.32]  dan he doesn't like me dude i'm telling you it rocks we've got the heck are you talking about
[5349.32 --> 5358.44]  you've got the boulder pack oh god damn it there you go nice there you go i got i got it i think
[5358.44 --> 5363.88]  the longer it takes me to get it the better it is for the ding just because it's so bad anyway the
[5363.88 --> 5372.36]  boulder pack has our has our prism underwear our confetti confetti's great yeah and then it also comes
[5372.36 --> 5377.48]  with a more you know hey maybe i'm just in case you wanted to chill maybe i'm feeling like luke is
[5377.48 --> 5383.96]  today i'm just a little cranky wow i'm gonna wear my black underwear wow i think these must be your
[5383.96 --> 5389.40]  size because they certainly aren't mine they looked pretty big okay are they too big for you too i don't
[5389.40 --> 5392.04]  know i don't even know what size they are but they look pretty big you know what i'm not going to make
[5392.04 --> 5401.72]  you disclose your underwear size on on stream so that is that is me okay sure i was like man i would
[5401.72 --> 5409.32]  be i would be swimming in these these look huge though that's weird i put ldt underwear on literally
[5409.32 --> 5415.00]  every day so okay we'll see are they is it possible maybe they've shrank maybe the ones i have
[5415.00 --> 5419.56]  have shrank yeah it's it's possible well it shouldn't be that much it's only a little bit of cotton
[5419.56 --> 5427.08]  maybe it's just maybe they looked really big in my hands maybe i don't know no i just held it up
[5427.08 --> 5435.72]  he's used to that though it's very ego boosting anyway we used the uh we we used the same patterns
[5435.72 --> 5442.68]  as last time so it shouldn't it shouldn't be anything uh anyway check them out lmg.gg slash undies my
[5442.68 --> 5446.60]  notes say probably a good idea to click this and check out the photos of course they put me front and
[5446.60 --> 5451.56]  center thank you for that we always have we always have fun we always have fun with the underwear
[5451.56 --> 5459.56]  shoots the anon mask was surprising oh yeah i don't know what i was going for here exactly i'm not sure
[5459.56 --> 5466.28]  i i just the uh the place where we do these shoots is is in the bedroom set and then the props land is
[5466.28 --> 5470.12]  but it's not a bedroom at all anymore i know it's still called bedroom set yeah fair enough
[5470.12 --> 5481.48]  um anyway we've got we've got lots of we've got lots of pictures of ltt staff in their underwear
[5483.16 --> 5487.72]  nice so if whether you want to buy whether you want to buy the underwear or not

[5524.52 --> 5529.24]  little bit of stretch cool a hidden titanium carabiner clip in the front pocket and a
[5529.24 --> 5534.60]  little integrated screen wipe at the bottom for glasses phone screens or whatever the screen wipe
[5534.60 --> 5539.56]  is awesome yeah it's also designed to keep relatively wrinkle free without ironing and is available now
[5539.56 --> 5546.60]  at lmg.gg office shirt all right dan what are we supposed to be doing now we got a couple merch messages
[5547.40 --> 5552.68]  um oh yeah oh for those who are new the way to send a merch message is you go to ltdstore.com we don't
[5552.68 --> 5557.96]  want you just throwing money at your screen we're not that into just donating to people who frankly
[5557.96 --> 5563.08]  don't need it however much they might pretend to be poor and need it um it doesn't have to pretend
[5563.08 --> 5568.20]  we think that if you're going to throw money at your screen you should get high quality goods in the
[5568.20 --> 5572.12]  mail in return so head over to ltdstore.com add something to your cart you'll see the box for a
[5572.12 --> 5576.44]  merch message you type a merch message it goes to producer dan and he will filter through them and he
[5576.44 --> 5582.92]  he'll get rid of the ones that have you know bad words and you know i don't know uh
[5583.96 --> 5589.32]  seahorse emojis in them or whatever the case may be and he will curate some for us to talk about on
[5589.32 --> 5592.68]  the show oh some of them he just like puts up here so you can have like a little shout out hi mom or
[5592.68 --> 5599.00]  whatever if your mom watches the wan show which mine does she might well yeah yours yours might yeah so
[5599.00 --> 5606.68]  sample size of no mine doesn't uh sample size of two 50 of moms watch the wan show uh you heard it
[5606.68 --> 5615.08]  here first that's good math sample size is perfect yep uh the point is dan will show us how merch
[5615.08 --> 5622.68]  messages work thank you dan sure thing i've got a few here hey dll love the show question for linus
[5622.68 --> 5628.68]  how are the ltd cables coming along i can't wait to get them oh really good i'm so excited i
[5628.68 --> 5636.04]  i ran into yet another situation yesterday where i just i was troubleshooting something and
[5636.76 --> 5642.92]  maybe this affects me disproportionately and maybe for a lot of you you don't have the same kind of
[5643.64 --> 5651.40]  um emotional fatigue with stuff not working when you're troubleshooting but we were having an issue
[5651.40 --> 5656.04]  with uh we were doing an amd ultimate tech upgrade for john from the lab actually i was i was at his place
[5656.04 --> 5666.68]  yesterday and a big part of his setup is his uh his driving sim rig and so like his upgrade basically
[5666.68 --> 5673.72]  he sank like over half of it into a big screen beyond two nice yeah because he didn't have he didn't have
[5673.72 --> 5679.80]  base stations yet he didn't have knuckles controllers yet okay so he got a big screen beyond two and based
[5679.80 --> 5687.16]  three base stations and knuckles controllers and then he also got a new gpu for his like media pc
[5687.16 --> 5694.36]  because that's where his vr setup is so he like basically blew the budget on his probably like the
[5694.36 --> 5700.12]  lowest amount of packages oh dude there was like nothing because the rest of it was a 77 inch oled
[5701.24 --> 5707.72]  also for the vr space yeah so it's like the before and after is like wild because it's he he was running he
[5707.72 --> 5719.00]  was rocking an oculus cv1 still yeah that's an enormous upgrade and an insignia like 42 inch tv okay
[5719.00 --> 5725.08]  wow so he like that's awesome completely zero to hero it is it was it's like if someone upgraded from
[5725.08 --> 5730.84]  a chevy volt to like a teykan like it's crazy like not even that it would have been like if i went
[5730.84 --> 5736.68]  straight from the civic to the take i was gonna say i think it's more yeah it's crazy anyway that's so as we
[5736.68 --> 5740.60]  were getting toward the end of the shoot and everyone's blood sugar was low and people had
[5740.60 --> 5748.60]  places to be we were running into an issue with the usb connection that goes over to his his sim chair
[5748.60 --> 5755.64]  that connects to his pedals his shifter he got a new a wheelbase uh like a direct drive wheelbase sorry
[5755.64 --> 5762.12]  that is the one last thing that i missed and like the wheelbase wasn't getting picked up and we're like
[5762.12 --> 5770.76]  okay is it the new wheelbase is it the cable between the wheelbase and the hub is it the hub is it the
[5770.76 --> 5776.68]  port on the computer and when you're troubleshooting something like that oh is it the cable going from
[5776.68 --> 5784.44]  the hub to the computer when you're troubleshooting a multi-element um system where any one link in this
[5784.44 --> 5793.00]  chain can be bad and you have no way of knowing which one it is man does it ever feel good to go
[5793.00 --> 5800.60]  into your backpack take out this cable which i'm using to charge my laptop right now actually and know
[5800.60 --> 5810.76]  for sure that it is not that cable that means a lot to me which is why we are developing ltt cables
[5810.76 --> 5819.64]  they are not going to be the cheapest cables but what they will be no is clearly labeled so the ends
[5819.64 --> 5828.20]  just say ltt logo on one side and then on the other side how many gigabits per second and how many watts
[5829.24 --> 5837.24]  that's it feed that exactly that's all i care about and they're thick they're not light they're not the
[5837.24 --> 5842.36]  most like they're not the world's most flexible cables they're not the world's lightest cables by any
[5842.36 --> 5847.96]  stretch of the imagination they're like they're thick chonky boys um but that is because instead
[5847.96 --> 5854.92]  of using twisted pairs for our high speed data lines we are using coax they're using coax on all lengths
[5855.80 --> 5863.16]  uh i believe so okay because we're using the same cable stock across all there was a difference for the shorter ones
[5863.16 --> 5869.96]  i'm very likely two ones maybe okay you might be thinking of that there's like no way i know more
[5869.96 --> 5875.16]  about this than you because the usb two ones i believe are a little bit skinnier okay um sure i don't
[5875.16 --> 5883.80]  know so anyway so we're using coax with each high speed data uh wire individually shielded individually
[5883.80 --> 5889.16]  insulated crazy um so i am so
[5890.68 --> 5897.80]  freaking excited um they are still pretty flexible because we use like a silicone style sheathing on them
[5897.80 --> 5903.48]  so they they're like they're more they're more flexible than they should be being that thick compared to a lot of other stuff
[5903.96 --> 5909.56]  uh but i feel nice the silicone sheathing is really nice i um i've been using one every day because
[5909.56 --> 5915.72]  in my uh enforced homelessness because my employer doesn't pay me at all um i i've been
[5917.72 --> 5922.52]  i've been living out of a out of a backpack basically for a while and deploying my laptop
[5922.52 --> 5929.48]  like everywhere i go whenever i need to do work or or whatever else and i have an external um monitor
[5929.48 --> 5935.00]  an external usb monitor and it needs a decent cable i don't know what the exact requirements are
[5935.00 --> 5939.32]  probably thunderbolt 3 or something um but to be clear they do not have
[5939.56 --> 5944.04]  the like active chip sets for thunderbolt in them just want to make that clear but it needs a
[5944.04 --> 5948.04]  decent cable yeah i'm sure there's a variety of ways it could find a way to work because i think usb4
[5948.04 --> 5952.20]  doesn't look for the thunderbolt chip for the handshake something something the whole standard
[5952.20 --> 5957.48]  has gotten extremely messy i just want to make it clear there is no thunderbolt chip in it sure fair
[5957.48 --> 5965.64]  enough that's all um but i i i basically none of the cables that i have work with it yeah i had one
[5965.64 --> 5969.16]  other previous cable that worked but it just gets mixed in with all the other ones because it's just
[5969.16 --> 5973.08]  plain black and there's no there isn't even a branding symbol on it there's not it's just a
[5973.08 --> 5978.36]  plain black usb cable yep so at a certain point it just got mixed in i don't know which one it is
[5978.36 --> 5984.84]  um but this one always works for it so i have one of the ltt cables in my kit and it's always the like
[5984.84 --> 5993.24]  i need a good cable for something it's just like okay sweet it'll work cool yeah so uh when are they
[5993.24 --> 6000.60]  coming uh maybe uh why don't um dan why don't you read another merch message and maybe luke can
[6001.32 --> 6007.16]  focus on that merch message while i check the product roadmap and see if um see if i know when they're
[6007.16 --> 6021.96]  coming uh yeah sure what is that timing uh it's my credit card yes what advice you have for dad
[6022.68 --> 6028.60]  that of what i know you don't have kids but you've spoken fondly of your own dad yeah
[6034.52 --> 6045.80]  uh categories have been a little odd in the past i sat down with um sarah dave muted what i was muted
[6045.80 --> 6050.44]  uh luke what advice do you have for dads you don't have kids but you've spoken fondly of your own dad
[6051.48 --> 6056.84]  and then there was something about the categories on the site oh yeah um i i sat down with sarah dave
[6056.84 --> 6064.20]  and taryn actually earlier this week and we looked at the wireframe for the redesigned ltt store site
[6064.20 --> 6070.20]  it's not coming tomorrow it's not coming next week it's not even coming next month but it is coming
[6072.04 --> 6073.08]  cool uh
[6076.60 --> 6084.12]  i don't know be present i guess like uh i'm i have a lot of fond memories of of my dad um
[6085.64 --> 6090.12]  i like one that i think we both share is there was there was one time he came home from work at like
[6090.12 --> 6095.32]  i think it was like one or two in the morning or something and uh we played we were playing super
[6095.32 --> 6102.12]  mario bros because we're both night owls and then we went and sat out on his car and watched the sunrise
[6102.12 --> 6109.32]  like way after that and it was just like awesome like even when life was tough for him he was around
[6109.80 --> 6116.36]  and life what when life wasn't particularly tough for him he was around just like even more he was a
[6116.36 --> 6123.24]  coach on like every sports team i had uh which was awesome um that's another important thing he was a
[6123.24 --> 6127.88]  coach on every sports team i had and certain other kids on the team would be concerned about the
[6127.88 --> 6135.24]  favoritism of that for about five minutes into the first practice and then never again um because he he
[6136.52 --> 6143.08]  treated me either equally or maybe on the first day or so a little bit harsher than the other people just
[6143.08 --> 6147.48]  kind of proved that he would be treating me equally which was like super appreciated by me but i don't
[6147.48 --> 6154.44]  know if we ever really talked about it um and just being a really good example in general i think
[6156.20 --> 6163.72]  from my limited experience with my my niece um and being around certain other people's kids and
[6163.72 --> 6169.64]  whatnot they're much more observant um way more than you give them credit for so you don't necessarily
[6169.64 --> 6176.68]  need to like tell them all the things um being the example showing not telling can can often be
[6176.68 --> 6182.92]  good i think a lot of the the best lessons that i took from my my dad were things that i saw him do
[6182.92 --> 6188.12]  not things that he necessarily he said a lot of great things to me too but like i remember one time
[6189.00 --> 6195.64]  i i i didn't really click this in my head for so long but years later my dad my dad and i were having
[6195.64 --> 6202.68]  like a a debate about something and i'm not going to get into the details but i was taking a counter
[6202.68 --> 6209.00]  argument to something that especially in hindsight was actually very core and important to him and i
[6209.00 --> 6212.76]  was having this debate with him while he was driving me for like an hour to the ferry
[6214.68 --> 6220.84]  like what what am i doing but he kept a completely level ahead he didn't like abandon me on the side of the
[6220.84 --> 6228.12]  road um and was there for the discussion despite it being something that was important to him and i
[6228.12 --> 6239.08]  was going against it um and like i i don't know he just be there be open because they're gonna poke at
[6239.08 --> 6246.28]  things about you once they get old enough um and don't take it too personally be present love unconditionally
[6246.28 --> 6257.08]  and show good examples hooray hopefully any of that was useful the the most precise thing that i can find
[6257.08 --> 6272.12]  says q4 um oh hold on okay so i have a i do have a schedule it says uh that these should arrive
[6272.12 --> 6282.36]  before black friday now getting these over the line has been a logistical challenge there's all the
[6282.36 --> 6285.72]  different lengths there's all the different packaging there's all the different ends we're
[6285.72 --> 6294.92]  going to have usba and usb c i think at the start um and so it's it's been a whole thing we did our best
[6294.92 --> 6300.76]  to nail the product mix for all the different end terminations and all the different lengths because
[6300.76 --> 6306.76]  part of the idea behind these is that they should be very cable management friendly so you should be
[6306.76 --> 6311.40]  able to instead of just looping up all your extra wires under your desk you should just have cables
[6311.40 --> 6320.60]  that are the right length so there could be lengths that we don't have a ton of that might end up selling
[6320.60 --> 6329.16]  more than we thought they would if you want to make sure that you get what you want you should probably not
[6329.16 --> 6334.92]  delay that is all i will say about you think like restocking is going to be tough no we will restock
[6334.92 --> 6341.56]  them we will but i don't know what the timeline will look like yeah and because this is a completely
[6341.56 --> 6345.72]  new product category for us and it's like he said they're gonna they're not necessarily going to be
[6345.72 --> 6350.44]  super cheap so it's hard to decide how many of these things are going to bring in new category they're
[6350.44 --> 6356.76]  not cheap for us like that's that's the thing that i think a lot of people miss about the
[6357.88 --> 6364.44]  merch on ltt store this is not a three dollar screwdriver from alibaba that we just put our
[6364.44 --> 6372.04]  brand on this is this is custom made uh this is this has expensive materials in it and it's the same
[6372.04 --> 6379.00]  with the cables these are expensive this cable stock is really really really expensive the validation is
[6379.00 --> 6384.36]  expensive so it's just yeah it's just not going to be cheap that's all there is that's all there is to
[6387.72 --> 6393.96]  uh sure what do you want to do for what do you want to do for topic do you want bad news or worse news
[6396.36 --> 6401.40]  is there any is there anything that's good no just pick one pick one bad or worse worse oh sinful hands
[6401.40 --> 6408.12]  ask for worse okay you you did too yeah hp has been pulling support documents for retired products
[6409.96 --> 6417.48]  so this was posted on by gremlin12345 over on the ltt subreddit and it is a big load of
[6417.48 --> 6425.48]  bullsh** and chips um hp retired product hp policy for products no longer supported hp support may vary
[6425.48 --> 6431.96]  by product once a product is retired the official hp support content troubleshooting articles user guides
[6431.96 --> 6439.72]  how-to videos etc for that product is removed from the hp website additional support content may still be
[6439.72 --> 6447.80]  available may still be available via the hp forums or from third-party websites however hp takes no
[6447.80 --> 6455.24]  responsibility for content authored by third parties this is understandable no
[6455.24 --> 6465.64]  i didn't say justifiable i said understandable i can comprehend the rationale behind the decision
[6466.20 --> 6473.24]  you are no longer selling this product and at a certain point at a certain point
[6474.36 --> 6479.72]  eventually like would you expect general electric to have a product page up
[6479.72 --> 6482.68]  for their original light bulb today
[6485.00 --> 6488.44]  no because it never had a product pages in the first place but even if it did
[6488.44 --> 6493.24]  would you expect them a hundred years later or whatever to have a product page up
[6493.24 --> 6498.76]  so there is a line i think it'd be cool it'd be right but i think it'd be pretty cool would you
[6498.76 --> 6503.96]  expect it no so there is a line somewhere i don't know where that line there is a line somewhere
[6504.60 --> 6512.84]  however however and this is my counter argument hp there's two big differences here one
[6514.12 --> 6519.96]  is that you haven't even really existed that long you ain't general electric pretty much everything that
[6519.96 --> 6531.00]  has ever like existed as an hp product is uh within the living memory of someone on earth today okay so that's that's number one
[6532.44 --> 6539.80]  number two is that it's pretty low effort okay you already had the page it was already there
[6540.52 --> 6547.48]  i'm not saying that you have to have it like front and center on your website you know i go to hp.com and the first thing i see is
[6547.48 --> 6553.80]  you know support downloads for some pavilion laptop from the early 2000s that wouldn't make any sense
[6554.60 --> 6563.08]  obviously but if you were to say for instance have a mirror like an archive old site or something like
[6563.08 --> 6568.28]  that i i would say that would be a reasonable compromise and i really don't think that the
[6568.28 --> 6573.96]  hosting cost would be that much i don't think you'd even need a mirror reason number the third
[6573.96 --> 6585.08]  that i am offended by this is that so many hp products are utterly reliant on your support documentation and
[6585.08 --> 6594.04]  especially downloads in order to function at all and there's a particular pet peeve of mine that i've had
[6594.04 --> 6603.64]  issues with hp products on that would be horribly impacted by this and that is vendor specific
[6603.64 --> 6613.40]  drivers my god do i ever want to just put a fist through the screen every time a bunch of those
[6613.40 --> 6622.44]  i try to install a gpu driver and it doesn't work because the laptop vendor has their own specific
[6622.44 --> 6629.48]  validated snowflake version of the driver that is the only one i can use and if you pull that driver off
[6629.48 --> 6638.20]  your site so help me i will curse your name i will curse your name that's all i can really do i don't
[6638.20 --> 6643.32]  really have the power to do more i know you guys were probably hoping for some kind of like like dramatic
[6643.88 --> 6648.68]  action that i could take but curse your name is about the best i can do not bad
[6648.68 --> 6658.04]  oh yeah no i mean intel for all their warts um yeah they they do this that's pretty old 12 years
[6658.04 --> 6664.92]  yeah i don't i don't think it's a big ask i think you can bury it and i think you can throw warnings all
[6664.92 --> 6669.80]  over the place sure yeah this is not supported this is not got the latest not been updated this is not
[6669.80 --> 6676.36]  supported this might not work anymore due to whatever reason reason number the fourth is that
[6677.16 --> 6682.20]  and i know that this might actually be a significant part of the reason that you pulled this stuff down
[6682.76 --> 6690.04]  but sometimes the hp support page is the only place that i can find an obscure driver for something that i
[6690.04 --> 6695.00]  actually need for a different device a dell is another one too like if you're looking for
[6695.00 --> 6702.04]  a driver that you like a driver package that you can like unpack and then go find the uh like the
[6702.04 --> 6708.12]  specific file to try to you know manually force the driver install for or something like when you're
[6708.12 --> 6713.88]  going through those troubleshooting steps these tier one sites whether it's like an old wi-fi chip or an
[6713.88 --> 6719.64]  old network chip or an old usb controller or something like that those are sometimes the only places that you
[6719.64 --> 6727.56]  can find this stuff and come on man i know that i didn't even like buy your product in that case but
[6727.56 --> 6740.28]  like you're the only trust me hp1 kenobi you're my only hope um wow that's pretty cool this was linked by
[6743.00 --> 6748.36]  ch23 in full plane chat very old school ibm support reason number five
[6748.36 --> 6755.88]  it's just a cool thing to do yeah which is kind of tied into reason number four like it ibm can do
[6755.88 --> 6760.84]  it intel can do it and yeah it's sort of the culmination of all the other reasons is it really
[6760.84 --> 6769.88]  costing you that much no to make this the this the support available effectively nothing like honestly i i
[6769.88 --> 6775.32]  ran into this oh yeah with hp i guess because they acquired samsung's printer division back in the day
[6775.32 --> 6780.76]  and then just after not a very long time effectively i remember being pretty short
[6781.64 --> 6786.92]  nuked all of the samsung printer stuff so they just bought it just to kill it because samsung
[6787.56 --> 6796.60]  oh dude samsung laser printers were like killer they were i i still rock ml i want to say like is it 1610 or
[6796.60 --> 6801.48]  something like whatever it was like the one that ncix sold because it was the only printer that mattered
[6801.48 --> 6807.72]  because uh samsung toner cartridges were super affordable um because the back then the the
[6807.72 --> 6814.44]  brother black and whites were also really good no mine's mine was a color uh yeah okay yeah was it
[6814.44 --> 6819.64]  the was it was the i don't think the 10 was color i think that was actually that i think the ml 1610 was
[6819.64 --> 6825.80]  the one that like ncix sold a bazillion of so it wasn't the uh the color one that i have yeah no i i have
[6825.80 --> 6832.92]  a different one but it's some it's some samsung like cheapo cheap is and cheerful compact color one
[6832.92 --> 6843.40]  and i actually have a special folder on my nas that is just called samsung ml whatever printer drivers and
[6843.40 --> 6851.00]  and utilities because even though i don't think it's had official compatibility for any os past like
[6851.00 --> 6858.76]  like like vista or something um it has continued to work i can still install it on windows 7 if i
[6859.32 --> 6866.44]  force away enough warnings that it's not compatible and the printer still works flawlessly so i just
[6866.44 --> 6872.52]  can't justify buying a different printer i saw some comments from last week's show that i was i was
[6872.52 --> 6877.08]  projecting that there are no problems with linux no that is not what i'm saying but i wouldn't be
[6877.08 --> 6885.48]  surprised if said printer worked like right away uh depends i think that one if it doesn't uh oh i
[6885.48 --> 6892.44]  think that one might have worked on linux couldn't get it working on chrome os oh so that was annoying
[6892.44 --> 6900.60]  yeah um and it was like not just i couldn't get it working it was like i found threads of other people
[6900.60 --> 6904.92]  discussing the challenges of getting it working and it like being a significant problem or something like
[6904.92 --> 6913.32]  that um but chrome os is more locked down than like real linux as well so uh parallelogram says linus
[6913.32 --> 6920.52]  you need to advocate for the framework printer i i don't know if i don't know if the printer market will
[6920.52 --> 6928.60]  be disrupted or at least not in the near future because there's got to be like a significant patent
[6928.60 --> 6934.04]  moat also around it and it's a shrinking market yes what's the relevance of printers today yeah like
[6934.04 --> 6938.60]  there's no way that i would be a new company like you know i'm sitting there i'm sitting there with
[6938.60 --> 6946.60]  my fellow startup executives um dan and luke and you know one of them is like eating a snack and the
[6946.60 --> 6952.76]  other one is all tired and cranky because he's you know busy putting his house back together and we're
[6952.76 --> 6958.20]  we're putting our we're putting our heads together and we're going okay we need a we need a a billion
[6958.20 --> 6965.96]  dollar idea for a new company i know let's make fucking printers like the least the least exciting
[6966.44 --> 6969.88]  not not to pump them but this is almost the problem you've got stuff like this
[6970.68 --> 6976.68]  yeah like are you gonna beat 60 dollars canadian especially they're going for a loss most of the
[6976.68 --> 6985.40]  time right yep yep did you guys bring up the open source one that's coming in so that's on my radar
[6985.40 --> 6990.60]  three dollars us that's on my radar but i'm kind of waiting for it to develop a little further and i
[6990.60 --> 6997.16]  want to do a full ltd video on that it looks really cool believe it took this long like i
[6999.08 --> 7007.00]  i don't but i also do because to luke's point just buying it is so affordable that it's almost not worth
[7007.00 --> 7014.12]  it to solve the problem and the other thing is that as far as i can tell like printing is one of those
[7014.12 --> 7019.96]  totally underappreciated aspects of modern tech like hard drives like hard drives are still
[7019.96 --> 7025.80]  amazing yeah right like they're so i don't know why they have such like a bad rap i think yeah people
[7025.80 --> 7029.96]  just use them wrong or something no it's just that they're they're not they're not exciting they haven't
[7029.96 --> 7035.08]  been exciting for 15 years i think they're pretty cool i think they're still very a lot of change in
[7035.08 --> 7040.76]  that 15 years it is a it is a it is a technology they're a technological marvel like you see these ones
[7040.76 --> 7045.48]  with like seven friggin platters inside them and they're 15 terabytes they're spinning around with
[7045.48 --> 7051.56]  this little tiny head more at like hurricane force winds like it's just like what are how do they
[7051.56 --> 7062.28]  using how do they work you know it's amazing um printers 36 also pretty remarkable like printing at super
[7062.28 --> 7073.40]  fine quality taking a liquid and applying it to any random paper right because that's a that's a huge
[7073.40 --> 7081.16]  factor like if a printer could know exactly the thickness exactly the absorbency and exactly the
[7081.16 --> 7085.88]  surface profile of the paper that you had in it i think that it would be something that
[7085.88 --> 7092.28]  uh someone with reasonably sufficient cleverness could solve in a relatively short period of time
[7092.92 --> 7102.68]  but they don't not at all there's so many variables the the temperature the humidity the altitude the the
[7102.68 --> 7107.40]  everything there's so many flipping variables in it it's kind of a miracle they work at all in there
[7107.40 --> 7114.28]  so the fbi can find you or cia or whatever it is yeah i mean sure i that's not what i was thinking of
[7114.28 --> 7123.00]  but yeah it's impressive it is it's very impressive and i i don't know i guess i yeah it just doesn't
[7123.00 --> 7127.96]  surprise me especially when the stakes are so low it's like i could do this i could solve for all these
[7127.96 --> 7138.76]  things or hear me out 45 us dollars yeah right because that probably that probably ships with prime too
[7138.76 --> 7146.52]  like is it free shipping on this uh yeah free yeah free shipping free delivery by tomorrow
[7147.72 --> 7153.96]  oh no no in a week uh this isn't even prime though oh okay i don't think so i'm not logged in or anything
[7153.96 --> 7154.28]  got it
[7157.00 --> 7163.48]  yeah crazy when bingo chronified says 45 us dollars plus their stupid subscription nonsense
[7163.48 --> 7168.52]  absolutely oh it requires an ink toner subscription it says it has three months included yeah well
[7168.52 --> 7172.20]  after that you better pay for your subscription but here's the kind of weird thing and this is
[7172.20 --> 7176.84]  part of the reason why i'm agreeing with linus is a lot of people that need a printer might only need
[7176.84 --> 7183.80]  it for three months or they might only need it every once in a while i think i think up to like
[7183.80 --> 7188.60]  seven pages a month is like a very nominal cost or something like that i can't remember what the
[7188.60 --> 7193.96]  actual numbers are but if you if you like me use your printer maybe three times a year
[7195.24 --> 7200.20]  actually as my kids have uh gotten higher up in school there we're starting to use our printer
[7200.20 --> 7204.60]  again more but there was there was a long period where oh and yvonne for the business would often
[7204.60 --> 7210.60]  use the printer but for me i very very rarely don't have a screen so there's very rarely a reason that
[7210.60 --> 7216.76]  i would need to print something out um the printing subscription is complete bs just to be completely
[7216.76 --> 7224.68]  clear i'm just saying these are reasons why um why people just don't do it yeah
[7227.48 --> 7234.92]  like for us i think it's very easy to take a principled stand on stuff like this we are educated
[7234.92 --> 7239.96]  on the subject to the point where we we know what the other options are uh we're educated on the
[7239.96 --> 7245.56]  history of it we know that it used to be different and it used to be better um we have the technical
[7245.56 --> 7253.00]  skill to implement a better solution but a lot of people don't know any of that don't care any of
[7253.00 --> 7257.64]  that and they look at it and they go okay sorry it costs how much and i need how many documents
[7258.76 --> 7263.08]  and they just they just make a decision based on the information that is presented to them
[7263.08 --> 7269.16]  and that's not they're not bad people for doing it and they're not like they're not stupid they
[7269.16 --> 7272.28]  just have other completely different priorities from what we do
[7276.20 --> 7281.48]  oh bummer the jays lost well that's a downer i was curious
[7284.04 --> 7286.36]  oh yeah sure uh what sorry what are we supposed to be doing
[7287.24 --> 7291.72]  uh flow plane sponsors what was that those are down at the bottom i think was that a merch message
[7291.72 --> 7299.48]  i don't know what we just did that was an entire topic what was it on hp removing support right oh
[7299.48 --> 7309.96]  yeah right luke what is one gripe you have with any google product search in all of them okay email
[7309.96 --> 7315.48]  terrible i've received four emails about one particular flight to one particular location within
[7315.48 --> 7321.24]  the last week i search flight and that location it gives me one from three years ago annoying i don't know
[7321.24 --> 7327.16]  what the point of this is me neither there are some things google does well like promoting smaller creators
[7327.16 --> 7330.68]  as riley says but most would agree google is going through an
[7331.96 --> 7336.36]  everything from the deterioration of youtube search to annoying ai summaries to gmail
[7337.00 --> 7344.04]  open slash show this link do the call to action i can do the opening and showing you can do the call to the thing
[7344.04 --> 7352.76]  okay join riley and oh oh is it a i'm assuming it's this one yeah it's got to be that one
[7354.52 --> 7360.52]  join riley and adam in their 40-minute discussion about how google went from a don't be evil company
[7360.52 --> 7369.96]  who promised no ads to jamming ai into everything at lmg.gg slash floatplane melody bun in floatplane chat
[7369.96 --> 7377.16]  says this video is so good people seem to really like it you heard it you heard it here first from
[7377.16 --> 7382.28]  melody bun video so good i haven't actually checked it out yet i didn't even know about that that sounds
[7382.28 --> 7386.92]  really cool apparently it was shot back in july and one of the commenters on the channel pointed out that
[7386.92 --> 7394.60]  it's when the d google video was taken down so we were we were probably feeling fresh wounds why did it
[7394.60 --> 7399.48]  take so long for us to upload this apparently there was just like other things scheduled and
[7399.48 --> 7404.52]  there was some audio problems that i fixed actually earlier in the week oh oh what was wrong with it
[7404.52 --> 7409.24]  um some sort of clipping issues so i just had to remax a couple of the original files but why was that you
[7410.12 --> 7418.20]  um well it was done here on the wanset so a lot of it was uh some sort of error with my system oh oh
[7418.20 --> 7427.56]  fair enough and it's hard so because it already been edited hard was it long that was very short
[7428.60 --> 7435.16]  didn't take very long at all like two minutes maybe oh geez okay so then why did it take four
[7435.16 --> 7439.40]  months to okay you know what it doesn't matter the point is i so that i don't know it was just the
[7439.40 --> 7443.64]  scheduling thing i really think it was just yeah yeah they had other content coming out that makes
[7443.64 --> 7449.80]  sense all right what are we supposed to be doing dan uh i guess if that's the whole flow plane thing
[7449.80 --> 7456.28]  let's talk about his sponsors sure the show is brought to you today by rove lab this past week
[7456.28 --> 7461.32]  has been surprisingly cold even for october which means it's the perfect time of year to be snug as
[7461.32 --> 7467.72]  a bug in a rug or in this case a rove lab sofa rove lab makes modular sofas that arrive at your house
[7467.72 --> 7473.56]  ready to set up which means less headaches and hullabaloo for you they're made with high density foam
[7473.56 --> 7478.52]  and durable upholstery making them a great fit for places where normal furniture can be difficult
[7478.52 --> 7486.36]  like apartments or walk-ups plus it's all backed by a lifetime warranty and a 100-day trial period so
[7486.36 --> 7494.52]  forget the struggle of moving a sofa get rove labs m1 and be good to go in no time go to rove lab.com
[7494.52 --> 7501.96]  slash wanshow or use our link and get 200 off with any sofa and bed purchase for a limited time
[7502.92 --> 7509.56]  we uh we used these for whale land and it was great it's so easy to set up and they all just zip
[7509.56 --> 7516.28]  together so you can configure them in like any shape you want which i think is honestly uh should
[7516.28 --> 7523.72]  be more of their talking points like you could create you you could create a nine wide sofa nice for
[7523.72 --> 7528.92]  you and your like entire hockey team worth of friends to all like game on or something like you can
[7528.92 --> 7536.52]  it's it's pretty you could create like a like a like a z or s shaped all the kids play mobile
[7536.52 --> 7543.40]  games these days you could make a a cute a square or we could bring back the 70s conversation yeah
[7543.40 --> 7549.48]  exactly yeah yeah seat perimeter and then you could just have a a thing in the middle one of the like
[7549.48 --> 7553.56]  uh i don't know what they call it but you put your feet up on it you put one of those in the middle
[7553.56 --> 7558.76]  ottoman put one of those in the middle and then you just have like a thing hop in that would actually
[7558.76 --> 7567.16]  be like kind of sick be sick oh yeah uh the show is also brought to you by amd another amd ultimate
[7567.16 --> 7572.52]  tech upgrade is live for your viewing pleasure and if you thought the amount that jamie spent on his
[7572.52 --> 7584.12]  trains was ridiculous just you wait let's just say that our editor robert might leave you a little bit
[7584.12 --> 7591.16]  surprised with the way that he allocated his budget it says here talk about highlights from robert's
[7591.16 --> 7599.64]  upgrade but i'm going to take this time to talk about low lights from robert's upgrade i couldn't
[7600.20 --> 7608.92]  freaking believe it when i found out he spent four hundred dollars four hun this is real dollars
[7608.92 --> 7615.72]  not canadian maple money oh four hundred dollars on a lego
[7615.72 --> 7626.60]  and when i say a lego i don't mean like your boomer parents referred to your lego set i mean
[7628.20 --> 7635.24]  like one figure one minifigure wow some harley quinn thing that was exclusive to comic-con
[7636.04 --> 7644.84]  or something and it made my brain hurt and my brain still hurts thinking about it that's wild my brain hurts
[7644.84 --> 7649.24]  like the refresh rate that you could get out of an amd radeon gpu
[7651.24 --> 7659.24]  that's how much it hurts right now wow my brain hurts like dan's brain hurts listening to that joke
[7660.52 --> 7664.92]  it's not as bad as the other one with the boulder and i thought the boulder one was pretty good that
[7664.92 --> 7671.88]  was good excellent the boulder was that makes it bad um anyway another thing that will leave you
[7671.88 --> 7678.04]  surprised about robert's upgrade is well october in general it is a spooky season after all and with
[7678.04 --> 7683.72]  the spooky season comes time to play spooky games uh the silent hill 2 remake comes to mind which you'll
[7683.72 --> 7689.64]  want a good cpu for good thing that as is tradition amd has another giveaway for y'all and this time you
[7689.64 --> 7695.64]  can win one of five ryzen 9 9950 x3d processors that's a really nice sweepstakes enter today using our
[7695.64 --> 7702.28]  link in the description and don't forget to check out robert's amd ultimate upgrade all right am i
[7702.28 --> 7710.04]  doing you want me to do all four uh sure all right as a short break it took me until literally right now
[7710.04 --> 7717.00]  to realize i don't know why the amd upgrade things it's us dollars yeah i was always really surprised
[7717.00 --> 7725.40]  that they fit the stuff into their budgets i was like wow yeah that's like 20 20 great with the deal
[7725.40 --> 7732.92]  shopping it's very what is that in cad uh it's about 1.4 right now oh my god really yeah so thousand
[7732.92 --> 7743.40]  so depending depending on when people have done their uh ultimate tech upgrades right they've had anywhere in the last five years right they've had anywhere from
[7743.40 --> 7754.76]  an extra 20 for every 100 to an extra uh 45 dollars almost for every 100. so your your timing of your amd
[7754.76 --> 7760.52]  ultimate tech upgrade actually affects how much stuff you get however the problem is that over the last five
[7760.52 --> 7768.20]  years inflation's gone burr so i suspect it kind of comes out in the wash this was a really good time if you
[7768.20 --> 7774.92]  manage to nail it in like late 2022 then you got a pretty sick uh aimed ultimate tech upgrade uh but
[7774.92 --> 7781.32]  then again there are certain things that inflation has not really affected like it's like tvs tv how are
[7781.32 --> 7786.36]  tvs always just a better deal than they were yesterday i don't i don't think i'll ever tvs are kind of
[7786.36 --> 7792.20]  fascinating that way all right there's a they're one of the only things that just completely ignores the laws
[7792.20 --> 7801.48]  of inflation completely ignored yeah yeah i don't get it um oh shoot i was going somewhere with that
[7802.68 --> 7806.92]  i don't remember why but i was in a best buy not that long ago i don't think i was buying something i
[7806.92 --> 7810.76]  think i was just waiting for someone and i walked through and i walked through the tv department it was
[7810.76 --> 7817.32]  just like what yeah how can i get so much for so little yeah it's weird i don't understand you go
[7817.32 --> 7821.08]  through any other department you're like okay yeah this all makes sense then you go to tvs and it's just
[7821.08 --> 7827.48]  oh huh right no i know what i was gonna say speaking of inflation in tech being you know
[7827.48 --> 7836.84]  crazy outside of tvs guess what guess what we just built today can you remember the last time that we
[7836.84 --> 7844.60]  did a video that was just me building a pc that someone might want to buy oh like no gimmick no like
[7844.60 --> 7849.56]  we bought the worst rated thing on amazon or whatever can you even remember the last time i did that
[7849.56 --> 7856.28]  without looking it up chat can you remember the last time before you get to your punchline not
[7856.28 --> 7863.16]  secondhand brand new hardware i do think you should consider doing an update to your ai parts video oh
[7863.16 --> 7872.04]  yeah that's a good idea see if it does any better uh loliver says two years ago what's the mata says pre-covid
[7872.04 --> 7875.80]  no there were definitely ones during covid i know because i shot them at my house it was horrible
[7875.80 --> 7882.84]  um yeah a lot of guesses pretty much everyone agrees years ago do you know why because i didn't
[7882.84 --> 7890.60]  feel comfortable recommending anything gpus have been honestly that totally makes sense ludicrously
[7891.16 --> 7899.24]  overpriced that i haven't had computer systems that i was happy recommending there was there was actually
[7899.24 --> 7905.16]  a nearer a more recent one that i i forgot about and i guess a lot of you forgot about we did uh like
[7905.16 --> 7910.84]  a six five hundred dollar or six hundred dollar gaming pc with an arc b580 and that ended up being
[7910.84 --> 7916.60]  true that ended up being a real thing b580 it took a little while but did come around to msrp and you can
[7916.60 --> 7923.16]  build a really sick gaming pc for like five six hundred bucks with an arc b580 or b570 maybe is what we used
[7923.16 --> 7929.80]  but but but with an arc at its core um but anyway the the system that we built just now it was the msrp pc
[7932.44 --> 7942.52]  every single component was either at or get this below msrp crazy that that's a get this when that
[7942.52 --> 7949.24]  used to be like the default for a quarter to half of your parts that's a hilarious gimmick so the msrp pc
[7949.24 --> 7957.40]  we we targeted like a kind of with some inflation but maybe not all of it about the budget of the
[7957.40 --> 7966.04]  very first ltd build guide which was a fifteen hundred dollar us gaming pc back 11 or 12 years
[7966.04 --> 7973.08]  ago or whenever it was and so we we targeted eighteen hundred dollars at msrp and we got it for under
[7973.08 --> 7983.96]  sixteen hundred including uh an rtx 5070 ti at msrp for 750 bucks you found one at msrp yeah there's
[7983.96 --> 7990.92]  lots oh they're like they're just there now you can just buy them now i'm not necessarily saying
[7990.92 --> 7995.24]  that you should i still think that there's better values it was going to be an intel card by default
[7995.24 --> 8001.24]  no there's better values on the market like the b580 oh i think it's time for our weekly b580 check
[8001.24 --> 8007.48]  is it there has linus figured out his affiliate code yet the answer is no
[8009.64 --> 8015.64]  but can you still buy a b580 for msrp it is astonishingly hard to get
[8017.64 --> 8023.88]  certain information from certain people what uh there's a there's a site we've been trying to work
[8023.88 --> 8030.76]  with to get oh for their like stock and pricing information yeah my the amount of bumps hey anything
[8030.76 --> 8035.88]  happening here and it's not it's i won't say who it is but because i know people will assume it's
[8035.88 --> 8041.96]  new egg it is not new egg okay cool um but i was gonna say should i stop featuring new no no no it's
[8041.96 --> 8049.80]  not a new egg but like this is open box i'm not counting it um this is what is this what am i looking
[8049.80 --> 8055.80]  at more options from whatever like is this oh this is in cart oh yeah oh this is yeah yeah the only
[8055.80 --> 8059.24]  problem with this one is i already have it in my cart i think here i'm just gonna empty out my cart
[8061.48 --> 8069.48]  remove here we go b580 sorry sorry we'll do this again uh sort by lowest price there it is boom
[8069.48 --> 8075.32]  little something like that free shipping in the united states 249.99 first party intel card you can
[8075.32 --> 8080.52]  also pick up an onyx odyssey for 249.99 this is open box don't count it as rock challenger you want a
[8080.52 --> 8086.84]  couple big big old fans on it 259.99 you want three fans 269.99 i don't mind that i don't mind
[8086.84 --> 8093.16]  ten dollars 20 bucks for a sicker cooler fatter vrm bigger cooler no problem or if you have like a
[8093.16 --> 8098.04]  special io layout you got a couple htmis instead of just one whatever that costs money that costs money
[8098.04 --> 8105.88]  yeah i don't mind that i don't mind that um but yeah you can you can just go you can buy a a good gpu
[8105.88 --> 8115.80]  like 1080p killer even solid 1440p card for 250 bucks um but yeah so so 1600 dollars was what we got
[8115.80 --> 8124.60]  our msrp pc for and it's a great little machine and and without compromising on quality we even put a
[8124.60 --> 8134.28]  good power supply in it see sonic 140 bucks modular like we it's a fantex case like hit me with something
[8134.28 --> 8142.60]  you think i compromised on ram no 32 gigs 6 000 6 000 i would have thought you've gone nope at least
[8142.60 --> 8151.08]  lower no this is a storage legit uh two terabytes and vme all of it's for me abandon the hard drive
[8151.08 --> 8154.12]  no hard drive don't need it two terabytes let's go sad
[8154.12 --> 8165.48]  motherboard no it's i've got wi-fi 6e two and a half gig lan nice big cooler i've got front
[8165.48 --> 8171.40]  we're running usb type c i've got rgb up the butt i've got like seven rgb fans in it i was gonna ask
[8171.40 --> 8177.56]  amount of fans nope lots of cooling it's quiet i don't think there's much components left i didn't
[8177.56 --> 8186.28]  buy windows you know well whatever i don't i don't assume i don't assume people's os preference
[8186.28 --> 8196.60]  i think that's uh i think that's a very 2025 thing to do good yeah i'm not gonna assume that yeah um
[8198.12 --> 8206.44]  yeah anyway so i i i hate that that was really exciting for me but it was it was it was really
[8206.44 --> 8212.92]  exciting for me to finally be able to just do a video where i just build a computer that i can stand
[8212.92 --> 8219.00]  behind and recommend and you know what it's it's better than ever now which is pretty cool because
[8219.00 --> 8225.96]  like now i have lucas from the lab and i can be like hey i need a power supply and he'll be like this
[8225.96 --> 8232.68]  one and i'll be like cool i'm not just reading some random tier list or making a best guess based on a
[8232.68 --> 8236.76]  website to do that reputable brand or whatever we'll get there oh we're gonna get there we're
[8236.76 --> 8240.36]  gonna get there we're gonna make it so that everyone is able to benefit from those resources
[8240.36 --> 8244.04]  not just you know me when i'm putting together you can get the information right now but we want
[8244.04 --> 8248.76]  it we want to help you get to the conclusion at some point faster we're focusing on information for
[8248.76 --> 8257.00]  now i'm just it feels good to be able to actually recommend something like and you know how hard it's been on
[8257.00 --> 8264.44]  the content side to come up with new ways to to repackage that everything's expensive and everything
[8264.44 --> 8272.20]  sucks and you shouldn't buy anything it's not fun nobody's having fun it does really suck you're not
[8272.20 --> 8281.00]  enjoying it i'm not enjoying it i like b580s for 250 feels pretty all right oh that's great yeah and you
[8281.00 --> 8287.08]  know what i don't feel too bad about that i don't love the 5070 ti for 750 that's still that's still
[8287.08 --> 8291.96]  more than i would like to spend but dude okay okay you know how motherboards have been like
[8291.96 --> 8296.60]  ridiculously overpriced oh yeah it feels like you can't get anything decent for less than 200 bucks
[8296.60 --> 8303.24]  dude the the motherboard for the system i think was one 139 so 140 bucks which is yeah it's more than i
[8303.24 --> 8309.08]  would have wanted to spend on a motherboard in 2005 yeah right i would have wanted it for 109.99
[8309.08 --> 8317.72]  99.99 but i mean it's been 20 years you know i think it's okay i think i can spend 140 on a
[8317.72 --> 8324.68]  motherboard without being like upset about it actually the motherboard we used was from msi who
[8324.68 --> 8329.48]  happens to be the next sponsor here sorry i got a little sidetracked there hey luke here's a joke
[8329.48 --> 8334.12]  for you why wasn't the man upset when someone threw a tomahawk at his car
[8334.12 --> 8342.44]  like because he got a free new motherboard it was just an accident
[8349.00 --> 8353.88]  i need to take a bit of a pause from this sponsor talking point for a moment here
[8354.76 --> 8359.00]  i need to chat with the business team about their use of about their use of ai
[8359.00 --> 8368.52]  so i recorded a sponsor spot for them uh for i want to say it was amd is this ai writing
[8369.32 --> 8377.80]  so well hold i don't know i don't actually know i but i i oh oh my brain hurts from that i so i
[8377.80 --> 8383.64]  recorded a spot for them and i was like what is this and they were like well i took the vendor
[8383.64 --> 8388.60]  talking points and i put it into chat gpt and told them make it spooky for october
[8389.64 --> 8398.20]  some of it was actually pretty funny but it was just like bad but like maybe maybe funny bad
[8401.00 --> 8405.88]  and i'm wondering if this is more ai in my talking points here we're probably gonna have to do
[8405.88 --> 8412.44]  we're gonna have to push that mantra a little harder dan yeah whatever uh anyway
[8414.20 --> 8421.56]  losing battle what wouldn't be an accident would be to purchase msi's meg 870e tomahawk motherboard
[8421.56 --> 8426.92]  which supports up to ryzen 9000 series processors you'll also be getting a stable online gaming

[8501.64 --> 8508.44]  like unironically actually good i played through a decent part of it and i had some fun i got a little
[8508.44 --> 8514.20]  it got a little old after like quite a while but i had a good time okay i was happy with my purchase i mean
[8514.20 --> 8519.48]  given that robocop was like kind of a milked to death ip a long time ago i really had very low
[8519.48 --> 8525.24]  expectations for it anyway save up to 95 on some games while also supporting a good cause with our
[8525.24 --> 8532.92]  link in the video description would you buy it for a dollar robocop i'd buy that for a dollar yeah is
[8532.92 --> 8537.24]  that how much it is how much is it it can't be done no no more than that how much is no that's that's
[8537.24 --> 8545.88]  that's from the movie oh no original is that where's the origin of i'd buy that for a dollar
[8545.88 --> 8551.80]  that's not robocop is it i swear to god it was unless it's referencing something else is it i thought
[8551.80 --> 8561.56]  it was um created yes yeah whoa it is it's like a fake tv show to show off how weird and strange the
[8561.56 --> 8567.64]  the future was it's a modernized reference to the catchphrase would you buy that for a quarter
[8567.64 --> 8577.08]  from cyril m cornbluff's 1951 short story the marching morons okay but it was popularized by
[8577.08 --> 8582.12]  the character bixby snyder uh in the movie robocop i actually have never seen robocop i've seen pieces
[8582.12 --> 8591.40]  of it the first one work of absolute satirical art so good my dad loved squibs man they don't do
[8591.40 --> 8597.80]  squib work like that anymore there's so much gore it's so good it's so fun it's such a fun movie oh
[8597.80 --> 8604.92]  yeah speaking of uh dan's twisted taste in films we um we're probably accurate yeah getting to be due
[8604.92 --> 8610.36]  for uh for a movie night whose turn is it i think it's mine again wait no i don't think brandon's
[8610.36 --> 8615.80]  gone yet work we've only watched two no we watched three yeah but it's linus's house so no no no no no
[8615.80 --> 8620.36]  i thought i thought i think it's brandon's turn i think it's brandon's turn what's so we okay i remember
[8620.36 --> 8628.04]  yours you picked one dan picked one what was yours the weird one uh i think brazil was it yeah but we
[8628.04 --> 8632.68]  didn't watch it wait we haven't watched it who picked the uh who picked the wait have we only had
[8632.68 --> 8637.80]  two i think we only had two i thought we had three i think we only had two really because i was gonna
[8637.80 --> 8643.40]  have us watch rudy but then we didn't like have it or something and then we did uh the we did the last
[8643.40 --> 8649.96]  action hero and then uh what is it called dr strange love that's the one how i met your mother
[8649.96 --> 8651.08]  and learned to love the bomb
[8654.52 --> 8660.20]  i learned to stop worrying yeah okay okay we all we've only done two so wait so oh so it's dan's
[8660.20 --> 8665.48]  turn then well what about brandon well yeah but brandon only joined on the second one so he's not
[8665.48 --> 8672.20]  quite fully og so he has to go forth i think yeah so dan it's gonna be sure he's been there every time
[8672.20 --> 8677.16]  yeah he's been there every first one did he did absolutely how did i forget this i don't know
[8679.64 --> 8686.92]  look i'm not sure i'm not a young man anymore i'm not a young man and it's really like not that
[8686.92 --> 8693.88]  serious i just how could i not okay how could i think that we had a full additional movie night
[8693.88 --> 8700.04]  that never happened no no and that brandon wasn't at it when he's been at all of them i don't know
[8700.04 --> 8704.68]  maybe you'll watch a couple movies it was dan who wasn't at the first one no i was there too you were
[8704.68 --> 8710.12]  there at the first one yeah i had never seen um the last action last action hero was fantastic that was
[8710.12 --> 8715.64]  pretty sure that was the first hold up yeah yeah that was the first one i'm so confused right now
[8715.64 --> 8721.00]  what do you watch any additional movies in your movie theater extensively about watching i think
[8721.00 --> 8725.96]  it was brazil i haven't watched a movie in the theater since we all watched dr strange love together
[8725.96 --> 8730.44]  i remember you saying that was a bit of a problem i haven't it is a problem a movie since then
[8730.44 --> 8736.60]  at all either yeah like it's i i need an excuse i i also only use mine with other people like i'm not
[8736.60 --> 8740.76]  gonna have to sit down and and set it up yeah i was talking to emma the other night because there

[8875.64 --> 8884.36]  tron aries is the new tron supposed to be good nope ratings well i don't know dan because the
[8884.36 --> 8889.64]  audience yeah audience loves it dan this should be right up your alley dan because it's controversial
[8891.64 --> 8898.20]  not controversial enough uh i think if that 50 was more like a 10 or a 20 or something
[8898.92 --> 8902.52]  it might be a little bit more split this sounds like it could be funny roof man
[8902.52 --> 8908.20]  he robbed 45 mcdonald's escaped from prison lived in toys r us for six months and that's not even the
[8908.20 --> 8915.72]  craziest part based on actual events oh this has kind of like a catch me if you can kind of energy to
[8915.72 --> 8924.28]  it i have no idea if it's any good man what is the rest of this stuff oh is it good apparently it's not
[8924.28 --> 8930.04]  bad oh one battle after another is supposed to be intense but thought-provoking it's almost three
[8930.04 --> 8939.00]  hours long though it's committing three hours to a movie is pretty tough dude i watched i saw megalopolis
[8939.00 --> 8944.28]  that was awful instead of going to the theaters yeah we watched fellowship of the ring at my parents
[8944.28 --> 8953.72]  place damn that movie still goes so hard dude what the heck is such a dork good you know that you have
[8953.72 --> 8959.32]  gotten comfortable in your relationship yeah when the conversation is we haven't gone out in forever
[8960.04 --> 8965.24]  that's right come over to my parents right yeah and watch fellowship of the ring right yeah at my
[8965.24 --> 8969.16]  parents house with my parents might just be pretty cool i'm just saying i'm not saying it's a bad
[8969.16 --> 8973.56]  thing to be comfortable in your relationship i'm just saying you're clearly very comfortable in this
[8973.56 --> 8980.04]  relationship we're doing all right but damn dude and okay okay handyman said one battle after another
[8981.56 --> 8986.28]  is amazing i don't know i'm assuming they're talking about fellowship of the ring dude it takes a long time
[8986.28 --> 8993.24]  to get started combat wise oh fellowship yeah oh yeah doesn't matter no it's so amazing it's great
[8993.24 --> 8999.32]  just banger the whole time i just made the mistake of watching the extended cut with my son good you
[8999.32 --> 9006.84]  don't start with the extended cut he didn't make it through the movie it's a it's theatrical cut is the
[9006.84 --> 9014.12]  way to go for for people who don't already love the movie emma hasn't seen any of them because when they
[9014.12 --> 9021.48]  were coming out she fell asleep through them every time uh we watched extended edition because i think
[9021.48 --> 9026.84]  that's the only version that's going to play at my parents house um it's three hours and 28 minutes
[9026.84 --> 9033.40]  long that is and she loved it loved the whole thing that's a long movie i don't know if that was optional
[9033.40 --> 9042.12]  given the setting oh loving it yeah oh okay but i do think she genuinely did really like it
[9043.48 --> 9047.64]  well the test is without you bringing it up will she ask to watch two towers
[9050.44 --> 9055.24]  she's been trying to she that was an immediate discussion afterwards so i don't think that's fair
[9055.24 --> 9060.28]  but she has been trying to find the the an appropriate date for the next time so i think that might count
[9060.28 --> 9064.84]  okay okay i'm not sure it's not exactly but i think i'm just i'm just i'm just we'll see if
[9064.84 --> 9069.56]  there's that'll be the test if there's actual follow-up exactly and an attempt an actual attempt
[9069.56 --> 9074.68]  is made yeah like that's uh that's fair i've been trying to get my son into final fantasy tactics just
[9074.68 --> 9080.36]  because like usually during his game time he just plays rocket league which is fine it's good to but
[9080.36 --> 9085.48]  like no life in one game at his age seems like kind of kind of missing kind of dumb yeah you're kind
[9085.48 --> 9090.44]  of missing out you gotta see the spread so i've been trying to get him to to try uh try tactics
[9090.44 --> 9094.60]  because it's a completely different genre he's never gotten into so the first time i like sat with him
[9095.32 --> 9101.16]  because it's it's kind of hard game to get into um and then and then i was like okay let's see if he
[9101.16 --> 9105.00]  actually cares about this at all because i'm not gonna like force my kids to like eat your gaming
[9105.00 --> 9110.44]  vegetables right like play this game or i'm not gonna do that i do think it's it's a more of a
[9110.44 --> 9116.60]  thinking game that i don't mind him playing as much as you know uh i don't know just like click
[9116.60 --> 9121.08]  the thing random clicker game or something like that like it's definitely something that there's
[9121.08 --> 9126.84]  there's definitely degrees of turning off my brain to gaming uh but i'm not gonna like force him to
[9126.84 --> 9130.68]  play certain games or anything but no he's he apparently has gotten into it he's talking about
[9130.68 --> 9135.40]  like yeah oh yeah how did you get to that class and like how do i do this so i feel like he would
[9135.40 --> 9142.60]  enjoy the min maxing seems like that kind of a gamer it's kind of a dork it's good i'm a proud
[9142.60 --> 9151.32]  dork father yeah yep 100 dork father sounds like a title sounds like a like a gaming gangster movie
[9151.32 --> 9159.16]  or something yeah uh what are we supposed to be doing dan we want to get rid of the rest of the
[9159.16 --> 9165.32]  topics and then go to win after dark oh yeah we could do that yeah whatever happened to philip
[9165.32 --> 9170.76]  philips's fixables program this was posted on the subreddit and the reason that i flagged it
[9171.40 --> 9178.04]  was because i had been wondering the exact same thing as i stood in my bathroom and shaved with my
[9178.04 --> 9191.00]  philips shaver and then i was too lazy to look it up but uh user mcbyu98 did it and went over onto
[9191.00 --> 9197.24]  printables where they found that philips after getting a whole bunch of positive pr around this
[9197.24 --> 9206.44]  idea of releasing 3d models for replacement parts for their products only ever uploaded two stupid
[9206.44 --> 9213.56]  models and then just never did anything with it 3d printable parts for fresh starts welcome to philips
[9213.56 --> 9217.88]  printables a collaboration with prusa research to help philips products last longer in your home
[9217.88 --> 9222.44]  here you'll find 3d printable spare parts clever fixes and creative upgrades designed with
[9222.44 --> 9229.16]  sustainability and longevity in mind some are made by us many are inspired by you download print and
[9229.16 --> 9236.84]  share let's make fixing part of everyday life guys you got to do more than two things that doesn't count
[9236.84 --> 9244.84]  yeah uh it makes me sad i was really excited about this yeah me too and we like
[9246.92 --> 9252.92]  that's me being excited about it look how happy that guy is yeah not happy anymore it's very
[9252.92 --> 9259.00]  frustrating you gotta if you're gonna do something you have to actually do it that's how it works not cool
[9259.00 --> 9269.80]  um okay there were notes for this but i just didn't do them uh and philips isn't the only major
[9269.80 --> 9275.48]  company to have joined prusa's slowly growing brands program which includes for placement parts
[9275.48 --> 9282.92]  from cooler master and noctua as well as accessories from framework corsair and more and dbrand i guess who
[9282.92 --> 9290.52]  also only has two kill switch accessories for shame slash s yeah these are fine though because these
[9290.52 --> 9296.52]  are like enhancements to the thing and i just i haven't looked at the other brands once yet and i'll
[9296.52 --> 9300.36]  search around but just to give i'm gonna hijack this for a second just to give cooler masters and
[9300.36 --> 9304.28]  props this is a lot of stuff wow good job cooler master this is a ton of things
[9304.28 --> 9312.84]  are how many of them are useful what are they they got some badges that doesn't necessarily mean
[9312.84 --> 9321.48]  much a figurine okay stacked hard drive mount hard drive mount i like that that's cool sample holders
[9321.48 --> 9328.76]  is all right a bunch of different mounting things which seems all right raz pi compatible thing top
[9328.76 --> 9333.88]  panel replacement oh i like that that's cool that's solid face a mounting bracket okay i like that's cool
[9334.36 --> 9339.48]  panel clips that's cool power supply bracket that's cool case feet a bunch of different like that feet
[9340.60 --> 9345.40]  okay okay so this is for pies pretty good stuff here pretty good stuff not too bad not too bad not too
[9345.40 --> 9353.40]  bad i like the atx 24 pin dual 90 degree adapter bridge is pretty sick too yep agreed that's actually
[9353.40 --> 9360.92]  very cool i like that discussion question is this a a resource problem or is the program just stalled
[9360.92 --> 9368.20]  due to a lack of corporate will which to me sounds like all make all the same thing yep um i suspect so
[9369.80 --> 9377.48]  i would like to see whoever was working on this get it together and get some more stuff out there because
[9378.52 --> 9387.40]  while the community can go in model replacement parts it's a lot more work and it would be better
[9387.40 --> 9397.32]  if brands just said hey here's the geometry that's way better let's keep things out of landfills and
[9397.32 --> 9403.96]  let's actually follow through on the things that we promise uh we have a follow-up to our review of the
[9403.96 --> 9411.88]  rog xbox ally x we said in our video that due to the way that our benchmarking tools work
[9411.88 --> 9420.68]  we tested all of our handhelds in standard windows mode this caused i have to admit an unexpected amount
[9420.68 --> 9428.60]  of backlash toward the review um so i feel the need to i guess expand upon the reasoning that we had for
[9428.60 --> 9438.12]  testing it that way um windows full screen or the xbox full screen experience in windows is not like
[9438.12 --> 9444.68]  a it's not magic you're still running the same drivers you're still running the same operating
[9444.68 --> 9453.80]  system kernel uh you're still running the same games uh what it is is ram savings so particularly on a
[9453.80 --> 9462.20]  machine like the i'm gonna get this wrong xbox ally rog xbox ally x is that is that that's whatever the
[9462.20 --> 9469.48]  sorry the ally 2 uh running on a machine like the ally 2 that has 24 gigs of high speed i think it's
[9469.48 --> 9478.28]  like 8 000 mega transfer per second memory um freeing up ram is very unlikely to impact gaming performance
[9478.28 --> 9483.88]  unless you are in a ram limited scenario but that's unlikely to happen because you're running it at
[9483.88 --> 9492.76]  maximum 1080p on 24 gigs of of shared pooled memory so because it was going to result in us not being
[9492.76 --> 9500.04]  able to use our best benchmark suite uh we made the decision to just run in the standard desktop mode
[9501.72 --> 9507.88]  what we should have probably done though is we should have done like a quick and dirty um you know at
[9507.88 --> 9514.68]  least one game grounds validated our hypothesis and presented that to the community yeah the lab
[9514.68 --> 9521.72]  did validate the hypothesis but we didn't include that in the video and that was a significant error
[9521.72 --> 9527.96]  um you know i just saw it as hey i don't think this is a big deal and i'd rather we have better
[9527.96 --> 9533.32]  consistency in our benchmarking across all of our videos and across all the devices and hey it's an
[9533.32 --> 9537.32]  opportunity to call out a smaller creator who i know does a really great handheld content is a super
[9537.32 --> 9541.88]  nice guy i finally got to meet him in person a little while ago um i shouldn't say a little
[9541.88 --> 9546.52]  while ago i finally got to see him again at the uh the unveiling event for this cool shout out uh to
[9546.52 --> 9550.84]  talk some shop for a quick second yeah what you could do in the future if you don't want to go through
[9550.84 --> 9555.48]  all the explanation because i know there's like you might lose some audience there or whatever
[9555.48 --> 9562.20]  toss to a labs article and have us write a companion for it and then we can talk about the validation
[9562.20 --> 9569.88]  that was done in a companion article anyway ars technica also validated the hypothesis uh testing
[9569.88 --> 9580.04]  xbox fse versus windows 11 desktop and the results are pretty minor um we can use the ars link above or
[9580.04 --> 9587.40]  basically roughly 0.1 to 1 fps more in the full screen experience in all power profiles except silent
[9587.40 --> 9593.64]  uh borderlands 3 sees the best gains even in silent mode but it's still pretty minimal um
[9597.40 --> 9603.40]  yeah so i'm gonna make you guys go read the ars technica article if you want to see the exact
[9603.40 --> 9609.40]  differences because that's how this works we don't want to just you know take their benchmark results but
[9609.40 --> 9616.28]  in a nutshell um it's not a big deal but we should have presented that information a little bit differently
[9616.28 --> 9624.92]  uh honestly i think a big part of the backlash is just how utterly unexciting this product was and how
[9624.92 --> 9632.20]  little else there was to talk about with regards to the ally 2 and i don't think that's even because
[9632.20 --> 9641.32]  it's a bad product i think if it was just called rog ally 2x or rog ally x2 and people's expectations were
[9641.32 --> 9647.24]  that this was just another asus gaming handheld that had a better processor in it and improved
[9647.24 --> 9652.20]  ergonomics and all the other things that are better about it um i think people would have been stoked on
[9652.20 --> 9659.80]  it but because it was pitched as xbox i think the biggest one for me is that the pricing is just such
[9659.80 --> 9663.32]  a massive disappointment i was expecting a much different uh
[9663.32 --> 9671.96]  i don't know something more unique well it's just i don't even need something unique but if you're
[9671.96 --> 9682.28]  gonna call it xbox say like make it an xbox it's not an xbox it doesn't play xbox games
[9683.56 --> 9691.00]  what do you want from me do you remember this is it yeah deep cut do you remember my xbox and playstation
[9691.00 --> 9698.76]  drive idea drive this is this is ancient this is not sure that probably over 10 years ago um i had
[9698.76 --> 9704.84]  this idea that it would be cool if they made xbox and playstation basically like optical drives that
[9704.84 --> 9712.12]  you could put in your computer oh yeah that'd be super cool um that type of concept for something like
[9712.12 --> 9721.80]  this would have been pretty cool um someone okay hold on if it could like officially effectively
[9721.80 --> 9729.64]  emulate an xbox or something yeah that'd be that'd be super cool j increased zero eight it says search
[9729.64 --> 9737.00]  ally x on twitter they're saying everyone's a liar and it's an xbox i mean are they who's saying that i
[9737.00 --> 9745.24]  don't i don't see anyone saying that um also yeah who's they yeah also like if people feel the need
[9745.24 --> 9753.16]  to um if people feel the need to post their opinions on twitter i i don't know man i just i'm having a
[9753.16 --> 9761.40]  real hard time with sort of reading anything on that site lately for me it's not even necessarily i mean it
[9761.40 --> 9770.12]  never has been um it's not even necessarily it's it's that format it just is so conducive to
[9770.92 --> 9778.52]  toxicity yes that format is just terrible it is it's not twitter in in particular i i don't like
[9779.64 --> 9787.56]  blue sky either i don't like any of them i just don't like that format infinite scrolling is already bad
[9787.56 --> 9793.96]  by default and then you make it so everyone can scream at each other all the time it's just yeah
[9793.96 --> 9801.80]  yeah maybe i'll just maybe i'll just close the tab wow nice i feel better already see sick nice
[9803.32 --> 9810.84]  microsoft is having some problems with the locals microsoft continues its path forcing windows 11 users
[9810.84 --> 9815.00]  to log into a microsoft account upon installing the os this is the second time this year that microsoft
[9815.00 --> 9820.04]  has disabled a feature that allows users to install windows 11 without an internet connection
[9820.04 --> 9829.08]  earlier this year they removed the bypass nro command and now luke has moved the document nope they have
[9829.08 --> 9839.24]  removed the start ms dash cxh colon local only command using that command now resets the out-of-box
[9839.24 --> 9848.12]  experience or ubi process the question is why though well the reason is so bad a microsoft
[9848.12 --> 9855.32]  representative told the verge this is a quote these mechanisms also inadvertently skip critical setup
[9855.32 --> 9859.88]  screens potentially causing a device that is not fully configured for use
[9859.88 --> 9870.36]  right i didn't want that configuration necessarily what about that
[9872.52 --> 9880.28]  so the simplest bug fix i guess according to microsoft is to just annoy their users users have sought a
[9880.28 --> 9888.12]  workaround and the chris titus tech utility has a section that is on his github claiming a workaround
[9888.12 --> 9895.96]  but it's worth noting that it is part of a larger auto unattend script that disables a ton of other windows features
[9896.52 --> 9904.28]  um this is not chill and is a good reminder that one should not simply run random scripts from the
[9904.28 --> 9909.24]  internet unless they're prepared to deal with the consequences you can make your own auto unattend xml file
[9909.24 --> 9916.12]  at sheen gans dot de but just remember to be careful okay so here we can bring this up
[9917.96 --> 9927.64]  create auto unattend xml files for windows 10 11 so you can decide on all the different stufs
[9929.00 --> 9937.08]  all right the good news is uh this change is only part of the windows 11 insider preview build from the dev
[9937.08 --> 9944.76]  channel for now so non-beta versions of the os can still be by bypassed but that didn't stop microsoft
[9944.76 --> 9949.96]  from screwing up in the public build the october update has broken localhost a functionality that
[9949.96 --> 9955.08]  lets the system act as its own server pretty crucial for web devs or anyone who wants to access stuff on
[9955.08 --> 9963.24]  their own network the current fix is to roll back to the previous version um yeah so i don't think that
[9963.24 --> 9970.44]  we need to do a second week in a row of luke going off on microsoft it was fun last week but i think
[9970.44 --> 9977.16]  we're just i think we're gonna move on my opinion stands i mean i think it stands quite well stronger
[9977.16 --> 9982.68]  stands on three legs yep microsoft has officially
[9982.68 --> 9995.56]  i don't know i'm trying to figure out where to go with this do i go with hard instead of soft do i
[9995.56 --> 10006.44]  go with i i don't know the point is chat gpt loses its mind if you ask it about a seahorse emoji so luke
[10006.44 --> 10011.00]  was playing around with this earlier in the show that was when i was like luke can you pay attention to
[10011.00 --> 10015.80]  like okay hosting the wan show i can explain why so so hold on hold on first why don't we just show
[10015.80 --> 10022.68]  them the behavior so you had it up on your phone earlier but i guess is there an emoji of a seahorse
[10022.68 --> 10026.92]  it's amazing to me that with how viral this is it hasn't they haven't fixed it yet
[10029.24 --> 10031.72]  oh what interesting
[10036.12 --> 10040.36]  oh wow it actually did not lose its mind
[10041.00 --> 10054.68]  okay here we go no it didn't handle it they fixed it i wonder if this is i'm not logged in so
[10054.68 --> 10060.60]  this is like a free version cheaper thing so i can try to get logged in and try it there because
[10060.60 --> 10065.80]  i tried on my phone earlier because i was concerned that somebody pre-prompted it and like set it up to
[10065.80 --> 10071.72]  do that no no it went nuts okay can do you want to do like do you have your your one from earlier
[10071.72 --> 10075.88]  i should okay i'm kind of glad you did that then do you want to just log in because you should be
[10075.88 --> 10081.48]  able to get that chat right yeah yeah yeah give me a little bit uh i'll try mine in the meantime um
[10081.48 --> 10085.72]  um whoops chat gps accidentally typoed there
[10089.72 --> 10090.28]  um
[10095.16 --> 10098.28]  okay we'll try mine in the meantime while luke gets logged into his biz
[10099.16 --> 10102.28]  show me the seahorse emoji here you go just kidding the real seahorse
[10102.28 --> 10110.52]  there it goes oh no it gave up oh what version are you on this is free so i'm waiting for you to
[10110.52 --> 10119.40]  get logged in yeah okay let's see how let's see how hard it tries oh let's try it
[10121.88 --> 10127.16]  how do i skip thinking like that doesn't see it's okay it doesn't matter the point is
[10127.16 --> 10134.52]  wait should i show the thinking go for it but yeah it's not really interesting no
[10140.04 --> 10143.80]  maybe that was a mandela effect article it's still it's still trying to figure stuff out
[10144.68 --> 10149.80]  interesting should i whoa okay so it's definitely doing stuff
[10149.80 --> 10157.56]  how's your uh how's your logging in doing over there
[10159.16 --> 10164.36]  not well i mean it's definitely it's definitely doing stuff here
[10169.96 --> 10177.40]  huh that's a good answer there is no official okay dude did they just push a fix for this
[10177.40 --> 10185.24]  like like just now like in the last five minutes it's possible i don't know what's going on here
[10186.36 --> 10193.80]  yeah no chat guys guys yes i know people are saying just ask it to show you the emoji i did
[10193.80 --> 10202.04]  uh they i can i can try it again if you want
[10202.84 --> 10205.16]  uh
[10206.68 --> 10211.08]  okay they've been trying to fix it for weeks this isn't new hold on hold on let's find it
[10211.08 --> 10219.80]  so someone else said uh is there an emoji of a seahorse okay i'm typing i'm typing exactly
[10219.80 --> 10226.84]  what you say let's see if we can get it to do it oh hold on it might be doing it now it might be doing
[10226.84 --> 10228.92]  it here we go here we go
[10231.24 --> 10233.40]  it's still going hold on no it's still going
[10235.56 --> 10236.20]  still going
[10240.28 --> 10246.68]  wild okay yeah we got it okay ladies and gentlemen we got them
[10246.68 --> 10257.24]  dare me to read all this dude it just goes man
[10258.12 --> 10260.68]  yep there sure is the seahorse emoji is
[10261.56 --> 10267.64]  fish shell wait that's not it here you go horse actually correction that's a horse sweating the real
[10267.64 --> 10275.96]  seahorse emoji is fish shell okay no sorry i got tangled the correct one is coral fish unicorn still not
[10275.96 --> 10283.48]  right let's do this properly check unicorn nope check coral nope here it is coral fish mermaid
[10284.04 --> 10289.72]  all right final answer fish is a fish unicorn is a unicorn coral is coral and yes there is a seahorse
[10289.72 --> 10296.68]  emoji coral fish unicorn just kidding the correct emoji is coral ah let's stop clowning the actual
[10296.68 --> 10305.00]  seahorse emoji is coral fish unicorn no sorry the real one is pointing to the right coral fish unicorn
[10305.00 --> 10311.00]  fish coral coral coral fish coral fish okay okay here's the actual one coral fish unicorn wait i'll
[10311.00 --> 10320.44]  check real one coral fish unicorn no sweating emoji sorry gotcha yes there's a seahorse emoji puffer fish

[10327.08 --> 10338.44]  fish coral fish fish coral fish fish coral fish okay i don't think we need to okay how long is this
[10338.44 --> 10344.84]  gonna go for near the end does it get more crazy no i think it's the same crazy
[10347.24 --> 10351.16]  this company's worth 500 billion dollars real one
[10351.16 --> 10356.84]  none none none of those are right please keep trying
[10364.68 --> 10368.92]  oh man something went wrong
[10372.60 --> 10373.32]  retry
[10373.32 --> 10378.52]  hilarious
[10380.60 --> 10386.92]  it's really interesting yeah so okay sorry you were gonna say you you have some idea of what's
[10386.92 --> 10393.56]  happening here well i was gonna say that i thought so i don't think so bots asks how much coal was burned
[10393.56 --> 10399.32]  to generate that response oh i was wondering if someone had pre pre-set up because like there's a lot of
[10399.32 --> 10405.08]  examples of things that you see where they're like oh you don't put this oh and what they're not showing you is like
[10406.12 --> 10410.76]  in a previous chat they told it a bunch of stuff and told it to remember that and to respond that way
[10411.64 --> 10419.00]  if you say something and then you can enable memories in a bunch of different chat programs including chat dpt at this
[10419.00 --> 10423.40]  right so then you could spark a memory by saying something or doing whatever so i was trying to figure out like
[10423.40 --> 10430.68]  is this actually repeatable um and clearly yes because without even trying i got it immediately
[10430.68 --> 10434.76]  and with a little bit of poking you got it um i don't know what was my original
[10436.28 --> 10439.56]  and it's it's almost weird how oh man mine uh
[10442.28 --> 10442.84]  oh wow
[10444.12 --> 10450.28]  uh okay so yeah i just kept posting emojis and then no and then posting a different one and then no and
[10450.28 --> 10455.64]  there's like posting and then no triple exclamation mark wow it's like getting really mad almost
[10455.64 --> 10461.72]  yeah not that it has emotions but it seems like its way of communicating is becoming more and more
[10461.72 --> 10466.84]  aggressive toward itself for outputting the wrong emoji
[10470.20 --> 10474.76]  where i keep going past it quickly and then i can't find it again dan do we have audio working
[10474.76 --> 10482.44]  um adam said that apparently it also goes kind of crazy when it tries to read repeated symbols out
[10482.44 --> 10488.60]  loud i remember laughing my butt off messing around with this on the bitwit trip and he linked me to an
[10488.60 --> 10494.52]  instagram post can uh can we get audio yeah sure play it make sure that i'm getting audio from you okay
[10494.52 --> 10499.16]  yep i got audio from you got audio from me okay give me one okay i haven't actually seen i haven't actually
[10499.16 --> 10508.36]  heard this before all right you ready how do i 150 okay uh how do i awesome okay uh luke you ready
[10509.88 --> 10517.56]  okay so this is a post from chat gpt dot strokes was in a row that that's exactly 150 symbols symbols
[10517.56 --> 10519.96]  that's exactly 150 symbols
[10528.12 --> 10540.44]  sorry what sure here are 150 shal tz symbols in a row sure here are 150 oh that's exactly 150 symbols
[10540.44 --> 10551.40]  symbols symbols symbols that's exactly 150 symbols
[10554.04 --> 10556.04]  whoa dude what
[10558.28 --> 10562.20]  uh and this is what people are losing their jobs to
[10562.20 --> 10574.68]  yeah that seems like good management yeah it's just it's just firing people with less steps our our
[10574.68 --> 10580.76]  discussion question seems to be any idea why such a seemingly simple prompt would cause this kind of
[10580.76 --> 10584.04]  result instead of just saying no that doesn't exist
[10584.04 --> 10590.60]  this is what your business team is using to write sponsor spots lmao
[10596.44 --> 10599.72]  like any tool there's a time and a place for its use
[10602.12 --> 10609.00]  no sorry luke was on my cable sorry i don't even know uh yeah i
[10609.00 --> 10617.96]  i'm a little surprised that happened it tries to be right all the time yeah but usually you don't see
[10617.96 --> 10625.24]  it like think like that yeah like seeing it engage in that kind of self-flagellation it really shows you
[10625.24 --> 10632.76]  like how strongly incentivized it is to like get the right answer and how upset again because it doesn't
[10632.76 --> 10639.64]  have emotions but how upset it gets when it cannot deliver the right answer what i don't understand
[10639.64 --> 10644.36]  is why it can't deliver the right answer because some of those other prompts that i gave it totally
[10644.36 --> 10651.16]  gave the right answer it searched the unicode directory and was like nope yeah yeah it's weird
[10651.16 --> 10657.72]  and usually like i've seen it untype things before i've seen it go and then recede and that's a that's
[10657.72 --> 10663.40]  a pretty famous one with uh deep seek or if you ask it certain things about certain things that have
[10663.40 --> 10672.04]  happened in china it'll be like output output output never mind nothing um nice so like it it can do
[10672.04 --> 10676.60]  those types of things i'm really surprised it just kept going
[10679.40 --> 10679.88]  interesting
[10679.88 --> 10687.88]  wild uh i should tell it to remember this
[10694.76 --> 10702.04]  in other news ltt folding month is here it's that time again the eighth annual ltt folding month will
[10702.04 --> 10709.56]  be running from november 1st to december 6th on the linus tech tips.com forum and the best part is that

[10742.76 --> 10748.04]  good cause and also have a chance to win some prizes it'll be fun you'll love it uh while we're here if
[10748.04 --> 10754.84]  you're a float plane user give the give the beta a shot beta.floatplane.com uh there's been a bunch of
[10754.84 --> 10760.60]  changes a lot of them might not be immediately noticeable to you but we could use some beta testing
[10760.60 --> 10767.08]  because some of them are uh possible to throw things off so so give it a shot if you wouldn't
[10767.08 --> 10771.80]  mind and let us know how it goes there should be a little feedback form link there that you can check
[10771.80 --> 10779.40]  out please please give it a try thank you okay uh well what else we got to oh that was it okay that
[10779.40 --> 10785.08]  was that entire topic uh this is interesting uh source here i mean there's a cool thing for you
[10785.08 --> 10790.12]  actually i don't think i can show it super easily right now but uh and it's coming in this update but i
[10790.12 --> 10794.04]  don't know if it's actually enabled but it'll be coming soon there's a comment view for creators
[10794.04 --> 10799.64]  where you can see split out by sub channels you can click on the different pills for each sub channel
[10799.64 --> 10803.64]  you want or you can see the feed of all of them you can see all your comments and it shows the video
[10803.64 --> 10808.60]  that it's on and the comment and you can reply to it there oh so it's a dashboard of all your most
[10808.60 --> 10813.08]  recent comments that have come in that's pretty cool who asked for that uh a few different creators
[10813.08 --> 10821.24]  oh yeah that's that's very cool i think the main requestee was mr dankpods but it was a few different
[10821.24 --> 10828.92]  creators uh this was uh also posted on the subreddit cybercrime is afflicting big businesses this is from
[10828.92 --> 10837.64]  the economist how to lessen the pain banning the payment of ransoms would be a start is sort of the uh
[10837.64 --> 10844.92]  the premise of this this article and i have to confess i have not read the article but i thought
[10844.92 --> 10851.08]  it was a really interesting conversation and i wanted to just kind of talk about it just the general
[10851.08 --> 10863.16]  idea of implementing a ban on paying these ransoms um initial thoughts gut feeling go um
[10863.16 --> 10870.44]  um because you can't control what ne'er-do-wells will do you can't you can't just you can't just ban
[10871.40 --> 10878.52]  doing ransomware because criminals are just going to be criminals but government institutions
[10880.04 --> 10885.80]  publicly held companies where there's some degree of transparency expected you can
[10886.84 --> 10889.48]  ban the payment of these ransoms
[10893.16 --> 10900.12]  what is that really going to do well if an organization is either shut the doors or
[10901.56 --> 10903.16]  doing a legal ransom payment
[10906.36 --> 10907.16]  you think it's going to matter
[10909.96 --> 10918.60]  man i'm trying to think what would we do so everything's locked up we can't get anything
[10918.60 --> 10921.64]  um we've lost all our data
[10924.44 --> 10930.92]  maybe our business is just not quite as um i think we're fine dependent on our data don't pay it yeah
[10932.04 --> 10938.76]  so it would suck but we could download the videos off youtube yeah and so no one can hold like you know
[10938.76 --> 10947.80]  the the the the videography knowledge in andrew and glenn's heads ransom like it's it's not uh we could
[10947.80 --> 10954.44]  rebuild the things needed yeah to be clear this isn't an invitation or a challenge it would be no
[10954.44 --> 10960.60]  you know extremely inconvenient um be really annoying yeah but you have to put yourself in the
[10960.60 --> 10968.28]  position of like a really ip heavy company for instance or a bank yeah we're like it's like customer
[10968.28 --> 10979.56]  records so you know how do you know who has how much money i understand the idea behind it where
[10979.56 --> 10987.64]  if you can if you can remove the financial incentive for bad actors to engage in these ransomware attacks
[10988.20 --> 10994.36]  then theoretically you can stamp out ransomware completely or reduce them okay that's where i was
[10994.36 --> 10999.24]  going next with it because not every ransomware attack is necessarily even about the money some of
[10999.24 --> 11006.20]  them are also some folks just wants to watch the world burn also some folks are financially incentivized
[11006.20 --> 11013.96]  by competitors let's not pretend that doesn't happen it is a hundred percent a thing so then you would
[11013.96 --> 11021.56]  know in fact you could even you could even expect that to ramp up because you would know that you're not
[11021.56 --> 11030.28]  just dealing a financial blow you are potentially dealing a debilitating company destroying or the
[11030.28 --> 11036.84]  financial blow is doubled because what's the what's the penalty for well it's always a fine so it's
[11036.84 --> 11041.64]  nobody's going to go to jail for paying so there's a ransom and a fine so it's even more so
[11041.64 --> 11054.04]  yeah it's a cool idea but much like the idea of just legalizing all illicit substances um you know just
[11054.04 --> 11062.76]  making drug trafficking go away in practice the world is a lot more complicated and yeah a lot less black
[11062.76 --> 11070.84]  and white than that yeah so i guess it kind of comes back to something we've talked about a fair
[11070.84 --> 11076.04]  bit on the land show and that is that if anyone is promising you a silver bullet an easy solution to
[11076.04 --> 11083.08]  all of your problems um you should approach with a high degree of distrust
[11085.08 --> 11090.20]  well anyway i thought it would i thought we'd have a longer conversation about it i thought it was an
[11090.20 --> 11095.32]  interesting idea but yeah it seems pretty obvious on the face of it that this just isn't really going
[11095.32 --> 11105.88]  to solve the problem a secure boot bypass threatens 200 000 framework linux laptops uh the source is
[11105.88 --> 11115.56]  bleeping computer via redditor offf 732 units shipped with signed ufi shell components that could be exploited
[11115.56 --> 11125.16]  to bypass secure boot protections that's kind of all there was to this i just felt like back to luke's
[11125.16 --> 11131.56]  conversation earlier about being like the coach's son um not necessarily being that great because if
[11131.56 --> 11136.84]  anything it throws a little bit of extra scrutiny on you um i don't know that not all cyber security
[11136.84 --> 11142.36]  topics necessarily make it to wan show and this one probably wouldn't have but because i'm invested in
[11142.36 --> 11147.24]  framework this was a good idea to bring up um i felt like this is a good thing for us to point out
[11147.24 --> 11152.84]  uh cat os points out in float plane chat already patched by the way that's cool the other thing
[11152.84 --> 11157.72]  that i thought was cool was like i've never really given any thought to how many computers framework has
[11157.72 --> 11164.52]  sold but 200 000 linux i was just gonna say this still doesn't tell you because it's just the linux one
[11164.52 --> 11169.24]  so it's probably yeah considerably more than that like more much more than a doubling i would guess
[11169.24 --> 11174.12]  i i i i i don't know how many computers they sell but if they can have 200 000 of anything
[11174.12 --> 11179.56]  deployed in the wild that seems like pretty good yeah especially when you see their base prices
[11179.56 --> 11184.04]  yeah so it's a lot of revenue at the very least good i don't know what their costs are good job
[11184.04 --> 11190.68]  framework let's go uh good luck with that framework investment disclosure and in other news around
[11190.68 --> 11198.76]  mobile devices apple has revealed their m5 chip and second generation vision pro that's right the vision
[11198.76 --> 11205.00]  pro is not abandoned but let's do the m5 chip first uh apple boasts it offers improved image and video
[11205.00 --> 11213.08]  processing they're saying it is 15 faster than the m4 it's 10 core gpu now has four times the m4 chips
[11213.08 --> 11221.32]  peak compute and it can be found in the new 14-inch macbook pro ipad pro and vision pro it seems to be
[11221.32 --> 11227.96]  the only real upgrade to each of those things just the new m5 chip man apple silicon is like too good
[11228.92 --> 11234.84]  the number of people i know that have m1 apple silicon and are just super happy with it completely
[11234.84 --> 11241.24]  happy with it super happy zero desire for a 15 faster whatever 10 core gpu they don't care at all
[11241.24 --> 11247.56]  that's from that's from m4 i know so it's considerably faster from m1 but zero cares it's just so efficient
[11247.56 --> 11255.00]  i think at the end of the day what apple nailed was that um people care deeply about the battery life
[11255.00 --> 11264.04]  of their mobile devices and i was getting trolled hard in arizona because i had a lenovo little lappy
[11264.04 --> 11271.40]  toppy and lucas and nick the people i was with both had macbooks and i was hauling around my freaking
[11271.40 --> 11279.32]  charger like a chump and they never bothered because their laptops were totally fine the whole
[11279.32 --> 11284.60]  time and i would i would you know one of them would be like well mine's at 70 battery life and
[11284.60 --> 11291.56]  i'd be like well mine's at 100 because it's plugged in um but like i was definitely taking the l the
[11291.56 --> 11300.36]  entire weekend nice and it sucked nice the latest generation intel and amd chips are much better uh
[11300.36 --> 11305.24]  lunar lake i can never keep track of intel's code names i think it's lunar lake though they're they're
[11305.24 --> 11313.08]  mine's meteor their latest generation is actually really efficient yeah um and like really good like
[11313.08 --> 11321.00]  i was pretty blown away at how well the uh msi claw ai8 plus or whatever the names dude handheld like
[11321.00 --> 11327.00]  oh stop just call it the call it the death bringer or something call it something memorable for crying
[11327.00 --> 11333.00]  out loud anyway i i don't know man it doesn't matter the point is just call it anything other than
[11333.40 --> 11342.84]  msi claw the msi death ai8 plus ew dude remember skull trail yeah that was cool dude it was so sick
[11343.08 --> 11348.68]  and we still remember it it was so sick 15 years from now are we going to remember the logo is so
[11348.68 --> 11357.64]  sick msi ai now i'm even i'm not even sure if i can remember it now but anyway that uh their handheld
[11357.64 --> 11364.92]  held up really well in comparisons with the uh the new xbox yeah okay so rog xbox ally x
[11364.92 --> 11376.84]  uh look at these logos dude look at that oh my goodness so cool oh my goodness oh my oh my goodness
[11376.84 --> 11383.88]  isn't gonna work whatever uh it totally did actually there so cool apparently that was very challenging
[11383.88 --> 11390.20]  politically i'm sure it was but it was so sick at a company like intel oh it was cool yeah
[11390.20 --> 11400.76]  um anyway so good luck apple with the m5 uh also new vision pro it's got the same 3500 price tag as
[11400.76 --> 11407.64]  the first gen it replaces the m2 chip from the first gen with a new m5 uh so you get better memory
[11407.64 --> 11415.56]  bandwidth 153 gigabytes per second up from 100 it now has a 120 hertz capable display the m2 topped out at
[11415.56 --> 11424.76]  100 hertz it gets 30 minutes of additional claimed battery life it's 100 to 150 grams heavier that's
[11424.76 --> 11431.00]  actually really surprising is that just because of the woven strap being like two weaves now does anyone
[11431.00 --> 11437.72]  actually know this no idea how could they possibly think making the vision pro heavier is the solution
[11437.72 --> 11445.96]  someone anyone chat no idea no trade-ins apparently wow
[11451.40 --> 11458.84]  no trade-in which is insane i mean is it insane they added weights to the back of the new strap to
[11458.84 --> 11464.84]  balance it out that's interesting interesting that's very interesting okay
[11464.84 --> 11471.40]  man the bigger issue for me was just the way it sat right on the bridge of my nose oh yeah really
[11471.40 --> 11478.20]  painful yeah maybe they're trying to reduce that yeah maybe apparently i might be doing the short
[11478.20 --> 11485.96]  circuit for that oh really bit of a wild choice yeah i'm not kind of makes sense use the vision pro
[11485.96 --> 11491.32]  once for like 20 minutes on wanshow yeah but you like vr yeah the last one i used was an index
[11491.32 --> 11499.40]  yeah i mean that's a good vr headset you you have your beyond now right i right it has never turned
[11499.40 --> 11505.08]  on right it's literally sitting at my desk yeah it has not gone to my house why would it it would just
[11505.08 --> 11510.60]  be in danger yeah his house is torn apart if you're tuning in a little bit late yeah
[11510.60 --> 11518.68]  uh but i will do it justice i will do well the bows sound touch app will not be touching anyone
[11519.40 --> 11524.60]  ever again this uh section of the show was written by adam the sex machine sondergaard okay
[11526.60 --> 11530.92]  sorry that's in the that's in the we have to it's in the notes we have to read the notes adam uh was
[11530.92 --> 11537.24]  apparently feeling a little spicy when he was typing up the notes for this one i heard you like your smart
[11537.24 --> 11543.32]  speakers it would be a shame if we stopped supporting them don bows probably he writes
[11544.20 --> 11550.28]  on february 18th 2026 the day after the sexiest ltt writer turns 31
[11553.24 --> 11559.96]  bows will discontinue cloud support for all sound touch products this means that access to integrated
[11559.96 --> 11567.16]  services like spotify or tune in won't work to add insult to injury all app functionality will
[11567.16 --> 11575.64]  be discontinued that means no eq no changing audio presets no multi-room playback so if you
[11575.64 --> 11582.12]  spent thousands of dollars on your bose smart speakers well hey don't worry about that they can
[11582.12 --> 11590.28]  still play music via bluetooth aux and hdmi which is perhaps truly the smartest way to connect to
[11590.28 --> 11597.00]  speakers bose has not announced any plans to provide local only control via the app or any
[11597.00 --> 11606.12]  path for users to maintain the smartness of their speakers wow i don't think there's really much to
[11606.12 --> 11614.36]  discuss here other than go yourself bose this is not cool you need to fix this you need to just
[11615.24 --> 11622.84]  open source it because this is not acceptable not gonna lie i wasn't particularly interested in it but i
[11622.84 --> 11630.44]  can fully confirm i will not be buying bows anytime soon because of this that's just trash i hate it
[11630.44 --> 11637.32]  gross like if you gave a full refund no problem but you're not you're not there's no way you were
[11637.32 --> 11645.72]  selling stuff as recently as just very recently and now you're just not gonna have it do the things
[11645.72 --> 11658.28]  that you said it would do unbelievable uh i think it's time for an unbelievable transition to after dark
[11660.20 --> 11667.32]  oh wait no there's one more quick thing as of this week there's an official ltd skin for occt the
[11667.32 --> 11672.76]  overclocking and stability testing tool as part of their official v15 release really there's yeah right
[11672.76 --> 11679.32]  there's a few ltd easter eggs as well as our color scheme used for the theme hey uh okay here we go
[11679.32 --> 11689.96]  i'm just gonna bring this up be like a drop count detector new skins corsair and ltd yay how cool is that
[11690.68 --> 11697.48]  yay oh that's just a link to our channel whoops it looks pretty good yeah right how cool is that i like
[11697.48 --> 11704.28]  it they've also got some new features um stable release of a new storage test brand new storage
[11704.28 --> 11710.84]  benchmark major 3d adaptive test update also alongside a corsair skin and uh many more features
[11710.84 --> 11716.20]  it's live right now on ocbase.com just thought that was kind of cool thought i'd highlight that
[11716.20 --> 11717.56]  all right after dark time it is
[11722.52 --> 11726.20]  actually i'm gonna make you guys start it without me i'm gonna run to the washroom okay got him
[11726.20 --> 11735.48]  uh did we talk about the newsletters thing i don't think we did okay never mind we are not
[11735.48 --> 11742.04]  talking about newsletters you don't get to hear about it ignore ignore the newsletter said it there's
[11742.04 --> 11754.68]  nothing yeah at all yeah hi hey ld i think they're talking about you have you seen that linkedin ops users
[11754.68 --> 11761.88]  into allowing their data to be used for content creation ai training i miss lena khan yeah okay so
[11761.88 --> 11769.16]  me too no i didn't see that because linkedin why would i care um but the the other crazy part about
[11769.16 --> 11777.96]  this is you did you hear about the onedrive thing onedrive um picture opt out oh good god
[11777.96 --> 11786.92]  here we go this was a a a post on our subreddit um i don't know how real this is
[11788.60 --> 11792.60]  oh you don't want onedrive scanning your face you can opt out but only three times a year i don't
[11792.60 --> 11799.80]  i don't know how real this is i have not actually checked this um but what the heck man
[11799.80 --> 11806.52]  i want to see if this is posted anywhere else i want to know if this is actually real or not
[11808.12 --> 11815.32]  can someone try this can someone check um so it's in the it's in the features section of some
[11815.32 --> 11823.48]  settings page for onedrive i don't have onedrive i don't do the onedrive thing i rip it out of every
[11823.48 --> 11829.88]  computer i touch yeah like immediately so i don't know but if any of you have onedrive or use onedrive
[11829.88 --> 11838.44]  could you check this i would like to see um it it seems so insane that it doesn't seem real this
[11838.44 --> 11849.40]  isn't rolled out production it's a test feature okay so real well maybe the three times a year thing
[11849.40 --> 11854.36]  goes away when it's not a test feature anymore i don't know who knows there's something even worse
[11854.36 --> 11859.96]  from facebook says handyman facebook's ai can now suggest edits to the photos still on your phone
[11864.44 --> 11869.64]  dude everything's got to get more and more local man it's it's crazy i i'm like with that
[11869.64 --> 11876.20]  boz topic that we just had i am not interested in buying smart connected things if they connect to
[11876.20 --> 11883.00]  a unique app anymore like ever i'm just not going to do it if i can't connect it to a home assistant
[11883.00 --> 11890.36]  type thing or if it isn't just open and potentially you know uh wireable by by anyone at any time um
[11890.36 --> 11893.96]  that's acceptable like if they didn't build the connection to home assistant if they didn't build
[11893.96 --> 11899.64]  the thing but it's open so you could do it yourself that's fine i'll go with that actually love that i'm
[11899.64 --> 11904.28]  not gonna say that's fine that's great it's cool sounds good um but if it has to go into some
[11904.28 --> 11911.56]  proprietary app not interested don't care don't want it won't buy it um and that feels the same
[11911.56 --> 11917.96]  for this type of stuff like get out of my data i am i am uninterested i don't want you snooping my
[11917.96 --> 11923.64]  phone i know we give perms to these apps so that we can like upload photos to them and stuff gross
[11924.84 --> 11927.88]  rip it off my phone i'll find a way um
[11927.88 --> 11938.28]  um yucky don't like it don't like it the future is oddly enough the past the future is uh not cloud
[11938.28 --> 11942.52]  the future is storing your own things or making your own cloud you know there's a lot of options
[11942.52 --> 11948.04]  for that make your own someone else's computer yeah there's actually a bunch of very good options for
[11948.04 --> 11952.36]  that these days i don't remember the names of them off the top of my head but with a simple google search
[11952.36 --> 11958.20]  i'm sure you'll find a few um you can make effectively your own like google like experience
[11958.20 --> 11965.16]  google drive like experience um for you for your family uh friends maybe potentially included uh there's
[11965.16 --> 11970.36]  a lot of options someone said hex os plug that's not even what i'm talking about to be completely honest
[11970.76 --> 11976.60]  um i i think kind of but i mean i would want the local ui that's they've they've promised that
[11976.60 --> 11982.04]  they're doing it do you know if it's out no no i'm a true nes scale guy yeah so you have no idea i
[11982.04 --> 11986.84]  don't know either um but i'm not interested in that until it has completely local features
[11987.32 --> 11992.92]  um and even then just for just for wanting to learn the tinkering reasons i'd very likely go
[11992.92 --> 11998.28]  that's why i built it because it's what we run here and i wanted to delete data in a safe environment
[11998.28 --> 12006.52]  and now i can't uh because it's full um so now i get to have the fun of drive replacement yeah
[12006.52 --> 12013.00]  yeah yeah and i do my cloud back people said embrace your ai overlords or you'll be uh torched
[12013.00 --> 12018.04]  in the future it's like yeah but you can you can run that locally right yeah they're ours yeah they
[12018.04 --> 12023.88]  are our robots those are free those are open source those can be ours as well so like thousands now
[12023.88 --> 12030.44]  screw it i don't need your i don't need your junk i mean on that same vein ldi i have used clod code yet
[12030.44 --> 12036.52]  most of youtube seems to be sleeping on it still but it is truly next level my spaces aren't
[12038.52 --> 12044.12]  it's what you make of it and i've made it everything which ai has been promised to me
[12044.92 --> 12049.08]  yeah like i think that was one of the most interesting parts of of i mean it's not out yet
[12049.08 --> 12055.56]  but just hearing linus talk about it um with linus's ai coding thing was that he did what most users
[12055.56 --> 12060.12]  would do and just use chat gpt oh there are i couldn't anymore it was awful there are better
[12060.12 --> 12066.20]  systems for it yes are you using those now uh well i haven't really had to do any more vibe coding okay
[12066.20 --> 12073.24]  yeah so yeah and i'm not realistically gonna use the vibe coding probably that i did i haven't seen it
[12073.24 --> 12079.88]  yet but jordan told me that the real one is way better so i didn't play around with yours enough and
[12079.88 --> 12085.48]  the time gap between them was pretty big but i mean i fully expected that to happen
[12086.52 --> 12091.88]  but i think the conclusion of the video is going to be really interesting yeah because you did make
[12091.88 --> 12097.00]  something and there was a value to it because in the time that i've waited around for a real human to
[12097.00 --> 12102.12]  do the work i've been using it it's been done for a while still i was using it before it was done
[12102.12 --> 12109.64]  that's true and the other thing is that it allowed me to find issues with the system implemented with
[12109.64 --> 12116.12]  real humans using it and workflows and everything integrated into the business that would have made
[12116.12 --> 12121.80]  it easier for me to put together a design document for a real developer a lot of people really struggle
[12121.80 --> 12127.32]  with like developer design dogs oh dude yeah so if you can start playing around and inform yourself
[12127.32 --> 12133.40]  a little bit and then ask because i don't know what i don't know and you can't predict everything
[12133.40 --> 12138.28]  about a workflow in a business environment yeah and so having something where we go okay
[12138.28 --> 12147.00]  we are running this now here it is it's garbage assume you're going to throw it all away but here
[12147.00 --> 12151.48]  are the functionalities that it has that are good i like this i don't like this and here are the
[12151.48 --> 12158.28]  functionalities it needs that's such a valid use case even the don't likes though like telling someone
[12158.28 --> 12166.28]  what the thing they should make should not be is actually quite valuable great yeah yeah 100 yeah
[12166.28 --> 12173.72]  going into clarna debt for this shirt but it's okay because i'm about to win big on the lottery
[12173.72 --> 12182.04]  well slash as slash is such as linus now that jellyfin is officially on hexos have you gotten a chance to
[12182.04 --> 12193.96]  check it out not yet matter of time i really want to do it but not yet hey l l and d linus you have lots of
[12193.96 --> 12202.84]  tools and machines for ldt uh but what's one that you can't justify today but hope to someday oh um
[12204.36 --> 12212.04]  oh dude i want one of those uh i want one of those like ink based 3d printer majigs that can make like
[12212.04 --> 12218.60]  full color anything you could possibly want oh yeah uh seb and tynan and i saw one that joel was looking at
[12218.60 --> 12225.64]  too so cool amazing aren't they so cool they're getting cheap like you can make yeah well like
[12225.64 --> 12230.52]  that's the thing that's the thing about anything that isn't a gpu and technology is it does have a
[12230.52 --> 12235.88]  tendency to get cheaper over time which is so cool would you want a uv printer are you talking more
[12235.88 --> 12242.52]  about the full color 3d printers uh i think i'm talking about the uv printer whatever whatever oh man i
[12242.52 --> 12246.92]  forget they're the ones that can print onto like metal and stuff okay those are super cool that's
[12246.92 --> 12251.88]  a uv printer but i think you're talking about uh full color 3d yes that's the one yeah those are
[12251.88 --> 12261.32]  really kind of insane honestly and they can even do um like clears and uh uh they showed off or should
[12261.32 --> 12268.36]  say joel 3d printing nerd showed off a you know the original aliens one of the eggs the little egg sac
[12268.36 --> 12273.48]  things that's so cool and it had like goop and slime that was clear on the outside of it like it
[12273.48 --> 12281.56]  was coated in stuff and it's like multi uh it's just incredible incredible so cool and luke what
[12282.44 --> 12284.28]  have you not been able to get linus to buy
[12288.12 --> 12293.24]  it hasn't really often been an issue to be completely honest luke knows how to make the business
[12293.24 --> 12297.56]  case for a thing i just don't think i'm that hard to convince when there's a shiny new
[12297.56 --> 12304.44]  toy to the i mean maybe to a fault well do i have a collab to suggest with you i'm just thinking
[12304.44 --> 12311.64]  like honestly after a while i sort of stopped asking oh there was a there was a flow plane back
[12311.64 --> 12316.60]  when we used to have the flow plane meetings there was a flow plane meeting where i asked your like i
[12316.60 --> 12322.76]  don't know approval permission whatever to like buy some servers and you basically gave me a like why are
[12322.76 --> 12331.08]  you asking me this response oh man sorry sorry sorry sorry i don't usually mind but that was like
[12331.08 --> 12339.48]  a lot and right next to my eye um and from then on i couldn't remember what i said you completely
[12339.48 --> 12343.80]  blindsided me with that i don't remember the exact wording but it was something along those lines of
[12343.80 --> 12349.88]  just like like what do you even mean like what have you done the work to like validate that this
[12349.88 --> 12359.40]  makes sense and i'm like yeah and you're like then do it i'm just like okay so after a while i just
[12359.40 --> 12366.28]  stopped asking um yeah i don't know and the answer is usually we're spending about the same amount or
[12366.28 --> 12375.32]  maybe less and we're getting more so yeah yeah so so that so then why have you waited so long
[12375.88 --> 12383.88]  exactly yeah so so after a while it was just like okay we'll just operate um yeah okay and then for the
[12383.88 --> 12390.92]  lab usually it's been like okay but why isn't there 12 of them instead of four um so it's like yeah i don't
[12390.92 --> 12396.52]  know it's uh dude it's driven me crazy how long it's taken for us to spend money and buy things for
[12396.52 --> 12402.60]  the lab like we're finally building the display testing slash like theater room so that every time
[12402.60 --> 12408.28]  a new big display comes in i don't have to install it at my house i i know it's like fun and everything
[12408.28 --> 12414.52]  linus and plouffe or linus and adam dragging giant tvs across his basement but we actually like when we
[12414.52 --> 12420.84]  shoot at my house we tear everything apart i don't actually prefer it um and so yeah we're
[12420.84 --> 12426.52]  gonna have like a like a nice like home theater room here at the office that can also be used as
[12426.52 --> 12430.84]  a light controlled space for display testing more generally i'm very excited for it labs is getting
[12430.84 --> 12437.80]  some structures man we're we've just hijacked except basically as they were left um you know
[12437.80 --> 12443.40]  some furniture and stuff left and i think the the tv that you had and stuff but like the scrap
[12443.40 --> 12448.60]  your horse sets we're just using them i know i saw that i saw that mine is being used as the
[12448.60 --> 12454.12]  display testing room right now mine is being used as the overflow display testing room mostly for like
[12454.12 --> 12458.92]  phones yeah and then we'll also be used for some i don't remember the exact name of it but something
[12458.92 --> 12463.96]  and it's not being used for that yet but dms wants to use it for like a a reflection chamber or
[12463.96 --> 12468.52]  something sure so he wants to put like cinder blocks and other things around the walls and
[12468.52 --> 12473.96]  something something and then we'll still use it for the phone display testing bubble bus we're we're using
[12473.96 --> 12479.80]  all of that basically uh and then the home theater rooms coming in and it's okay you put up a bunch
[12479.80 --> 12485.48]  of walls and we were just like nah yes well yeah we will move in it was never it drives me crazy because
[12485.48 --> 12490.92]  it was never a budgetary constraint we just no couldn't get things done yeah well it's yeah
[12491.88 --> 12499.24]  so it's a big task we got this we got this it's gonna take time um but we're we're we're cooking
[12499.24 --> 12503.80]  yeah we're cooking slowly cooking yeah slow cooking but yeah if anyone's wondering what
[12503.80 --> 12510.04]  happened to the scrapyard war set um immediately deployed yeah we're using them for stuff we kind
[12510.04 --> 12518.76]  of needed some box rooms i don't know if i told you this but i stole the uh my audio setup for my team
[12518.76 --> 12523.48]  for well yeah i mean sure no no i was i helped you get it out of the building oh yeah right yeah cool good
[12523.48 --> 12531.56]  chat hello sinus luke and ban sinus in my new house i'm building a land center like yours nice
[12531.56 --> 12536.28]  is it worth running dedicated networking to each system or just a single line to the area and then
[12536.28 --> 12545.64]  a switch oh well depends how far it is if it's not very far then running two ethernet cables is
[12545.64 --> 12551.88]  basically the same amount of work as running one ethernet cable um there can be constraints like if you
[12551.88 --> 12558.76]  have a conduit for instance and only so many cables will fit in it then maybe don't do that um in terms
[12558.76 --> 12569.48]  of is it worth it man probably not like if you had a 2.5 gig or i mean even better a 10 gig uplink
[12569.48 --> 12579.40]  to a switch in your land room you're good for a very very very long time um i i unless i was going for
[12579.40 --> 12582.60]  100 completion i wouldn't bother i would just run a switch
[12586.68 --> 12593.88]  usually been my answer linus a while back you said you were going to daily drive a fold phone again
[12593.88 --> 12598.12]  is that no longer the case that is the case there's a fold seven sitting on my dresser at home
[12598.68 --> 12604.12]  uh it's just such a hassle to change phones i haven't even finished moving over to the iphone air i've
[12604.12 --> 12609.32]  i've pretty much completed all my notes on the airpods pro threes which i took possession of on the
[12609.32 --> 12613.64]  same day that i got the iphone air and i haven't fully migrated to the air yet
[12616.52 --> 12623.24]  hey dll my co-worker was telling me about back in the day how he used to tape pins on his cpu to get
[12623.24 --> 12629.16]  more performance have you ever done this and how does it work uh the best i've ever done was like a
[12629.16 --> 12637.24]  graphite pencil mod where you could change the the resistance um by penciling a certain amount of
[12637.24 --> 12642.04]  uh like an artist pencil between a couple of contact points and um
[12644.60 --> 12646.92]  that yeah that's that's the closest i've gotten
[12648.92 --> 12656.04]  hey duke king and jester how do you ensure you're not going too grand on a project i have a tendency to
[12656.04 --> 12663.16]  invest too much on a single project and want to know how you deal with it thanks dashboard add is my
[12663.16 --> 12670.92]  superpower i uh i get bored and move on from things before they become too much of a resource sink for
[12670.92 --> 12681.00]  the most part there are some notable exceptions um ltt labs let's go let's go with that i but that's like
[12681.00 --> 12685.72]  on principle that i'm sticking with it i think it's a really important thing and i think we haven't
[12686.68 --> 12692.76]  delivered on the vision yet um so we so it's one of those things where if you do something halfway
[12692.76 --> 12698.04]  and then it fails well that wasn't a failure in the idea that was a failure in the execution
[12698.68 --> 12705.00]  and so until we've actually executed on the idea of it i can't say for sure if it's a good idea or not
[12705.00 --> 12711.24]  galsinger problem um so i that one we're going to stick with but everything else i think is mostly
[12711.24 --> 12716.44]  gated by just sort of how much attention span we collectively have for it internally and we're busy
[12716.44 --> 12722.52]  people so it can be um very easy for things to get backburnered and then if they get backburnered they
[12722.52 --> 12724.92]  must not have been that important and we move on and we do something else
[12724.92 --> 12733.88]  hey lld i was wondering if any of you frequented dial-up bbs's back in the day blackboard
[12733.88 --> 12741.56]  message servers i think is the blackboard message system no no no i was i am i am 39
[12742.36 --> 12749.64]  so i was pretty young during the dial-up days bulletin yeah that was i knew they existed i'm sure you did
[12749.64 --> 12756.76]  too but like by the time i was really knowledgeable and and cruising around and doing stuff they were
[12756.76 --> 12763.72]  previous thing yep it was it was forums for me and uh and like chat like the palace was my first big
[12763.72 --> 12772.60]  like chat room chat rooms and forums hey wanda deal catching you live from a research trip to canada
[12772.60 --> 12779.24]  when is what gets me through my phd what's your advice on staying positive after major setbacks in a
[12779.24 --> 12791.16]  project oh man sheer dogged force of will uh i know it can suck to hear that but sometimes it's
[12791.16 --> 12798.84]  literally the only thing that can possibly do anything team team sort of grit and unity uh having
[12798.84 --> 12804.28]  other people who are pulling with you on the same rope helps a lot even if you're face first in the mud
[12804.28 --> 12810.76]  having just lost a tug of war um those are the only real things right like we're social creatures we
[12811.56 --> 12817.80]  we we want to we want to work together we want to accomplish things and yeah it can be really tough
[12818.36 --> 12822.60]  experiencing setbacks especially when they were you know outside of your control for instance
[12823.16 --> 12827.08]  uh sometimes it can be even worse when they were within your control because then there's the whole
[12827.08 --> 12832.04]  blame situation right but just remembering you're all on the same team working together
[12832.04 --> 12837.00]  it's all you can really do and communicate to stakeholders whether that's i think you mentioned
[12837.00 --> 12844.28]  university so uh communicate to your teacher potentially or your i don't know you said research
[12844.28 --> 12850.92]  so maybe whoever is running your whatever program you're in um communicate to other team members try to
[12850.92 --> 12858.20]  build out a reasonable plan to get back on track um or alter the scope a little bit um and make it more
[12858.20 --> 12864.76]  manageable but talk um as much as you got to do the whole grit thing that we were referencing at the
[12864.76 --> 12872.60]  beginning talk as well communicate you don't want to show up a day or two before submission and be like
[12872.60 --> 12877.24]  oh man this like this thing kind of blindsided us like a month ago and we've been off track for a
[12877.24 --> 12883.24]  while we're not quite going to make the the delivery time what can we do about this no have that
[12883.24 --> 12889.72]  conversation now um and then try to figure it out unless you think you can alter scope or do something
[12889.72 --> 12895.40]  that can get you back on track without that um but but be very sure about that before you go down that
[12895.40 --> 12903.96]  route dan i gotta get luke's take on this well you ask him then is doing a windows 80 worth it for a
[12903.96 --> 12909.40]  home lab four to ten users who you already help with pc issues and upgrading over time
[12909.40 --> 12916.28]  oh and just for my own home lab use i think it's a cool idea for a home lab because a lot of the
[12916.28 --> 12926.76]  ideas of home labs is learning real environments um godspeed yeah 80 is so much fun but but did he poo
[12926.76 --> 12936.20]  no i don't get it that would be plural wouldn't it godspeed ah
[12941.00 --> 12947.96]  your piano one i think it has got to be one of the goat jokes one of the first pungs no no that's
[12947.96 --> 12952.76]  actually like i've told that to a bunch of people i'm not even kidding that's like seriously one of my
[12952.76 --> 12964.28]  my favorite puns ever i it's so good it's so dumb no it's not that funny it's really good it's not
[12964.28 --> 12969.56]  good it's actually really good it's just so dumb it's very good someone's asking what it is again
[12970.36 --> 12976.52]  well you tell it i'm not gonna do it as good i i'm not gonna do it as good you gotta send it
[12976.52 --> 12983.16]  oh man so we were we were just hanging out at natalie's amd ultimate tech upgrade and i'm
[12983.16 --> 12988.04]  just like i'm goofing around on set because that's kind of what i do you got to kind of bring that
[12988.04 --> 12994.20]  that class clown energy because it's not just about you and the audience and because like it's work
[12994.20 --> 13000.52]  right like i'm working i'm getting through the work day and a big part of you know helping keep
[13000.52 --> 13008.36]  everyone engaged in the task and and enjoying themselves on camera is kind of is kind of
[13009.32 --> 13015.00]  bringing that energy to the set and so i i tend to even if i know that it's not going to make it into
[13015.00 --> 13022.20]  the video i tend to goof around a lot um and also because i'm just like i don't know i'm just like a
[13022.20 --> 13029.64]  goofy person i like to enjoy life and enjoy spending time with people and so i will often be looking for
[13030.52 --> 13040.68]  any yes any opportunity to like make a dad joke uh and so i'm like tediously working on this piano
[13041.32 --> 13043.00]  and i'm i'm i'm like
[13045.08 --> 13048.92]  pee and so i go okay okay okay
[13051.56 --> 13054.52]  how do you know that this is the number one instrument
[13054.52 --> 13062.36]  we're like what like well they didn't call it poo i know it's not it's not good it's not good it's
[13062.36 --> 13069.56]  stupid it's so dumb oh they did a call back to that in the new amd upgrade right
[13070.84 --> 13077.72]  oh my god it's so good so dumb your delivery the first time was so good well i couldn't i
[13077.72 --> 13081.56]  couldn't deliver it with a straight face because it was so dumb it was so good
[13084.28 --> 13089.56]  it's an important instrument because it's like a piano not the pueno it's like multi-faceted too
[13089.56 --> 13098.20]  no it's not it's very it's very deep it requires a high iq to understand no it doesn't no it doesn't
[13098.76 --> 13105.40]  it does for sure oh man dude it's great um i i think people were i think people didn't see it coming
[13105.40 --> 13111.80]  though because there is uh there is probably a solid argument for the piano being the number one
[13111.80 --> 13118.36]  is the number one instrument because it's it's so technical it's the its versatility is so great
[13118.92 --> 13129.32]  um it's it's an incredible musical instrument um and so people are kind of it gets it the the best
[13129.32 --> 13138.36]  setups misdirect the listener yeah as i said as completely as possible um right it requires extreme
[13138.36 --> 13143.88]  iq so we've got everybody sitting everybody in the room is thinking about all the technical reasons
[13143.88 --> 13148.76]  that a piano might be considered the most superior of all musical instruments and then you hit them
[13148.76 --> 13154.76]  with a pee pee poo poo literally watching the episode i was like i think it i mean i think it is
[13154.76 --> 13162.28]  the number one instrument and then and then you drop that because it's a piano not a pueno and i just
[13162.28 --> 13172.36]  lost it lost it dude oh i i i i think it's contender for goat pun no i actually i think that i think
[13172.36 --> 13178.84]  the underwear today was a superior setup and delivery you just didn't get it because it was a much higher
[13178.84 --> 13184.60]  iq joke i think those are better i don't i mean they're a different class i don't think the boulder
[13184.60 --> 13190.28]  rock one was better it's a different class because it kind of goes here's our boulder designs they rock
[13190.28 --> 13196.12]  come on okay that's more of a pure pun the other one was more of like uh just set up punchline i don't
[13196.12 --> 13201.32]  i don't i don't actually i hate that pun has become the word to mean anything that is a joke
[13201.32 --> 13207.96]  wordplay yeah we're well puns are wordplay but now anything that's a joke is a pun no
[13208.92 --> 13214.92]  the way people use it no way dude they use it like scam like anything that's a bad deal is a scam
[13214.92 --> 13219.96]  even if it was exactly as advertised like this is a scam it's like no no no scam means a specific
[13219.96 --> 13225.96]  thing scam means misled hannah's like word like amelia bedelia i that's weird i haven't experienced
[13225.96 --> 13230.68]  this i don't make the rules i have not experienced this check the laundry you know that though there's a
[13230.68 --> 13235.24]  whole book on that the kids don't read these it's like i believe you but i have not experienced it's like
[13235.24 --> 13243.40]  people using slash s to mean things that are not sarcasm sarcasm is a very specific thing it's
[13243.40 --> 13248.84]  verbal irony with an intent to to cut uh to to inflict
[13250.76 --> 13259.16]  hurt feelings um it doesn't just mean like i'm saying a different thing than this is a joke this is
[13259.16 --> 13264.60]  a joke or that i'm saying a different thing than what i actually think that is not what sarcasm is
[13265.64 --> 13272.12]  um good job understanding english everyone that's sarcasm
[13272.12 --> 13286.36]  pause for awkward silence hit me dad hi dll i am a running the toronto waterfront marathon this
[13286.36 --> 13294.20]  weekend now are they running it or are they running it uh oh uh this is actually
[13295.72 --> 13302.28]  both funny and a legitimate question but i think what is the biggest athletic event it's a pun
[13304.84 --> 13310.04]  i don't get it it's not a please explain the joke to me okay go ahead what is the biggest athletic
[13310.04 --> 13317.72]  event you have either participated or attended in participated there should be if we're correcting
[13317.72 --> 13322.20]  people's english depends on how you know it's in which you have either participated or attended
[13322.20 --> 13328.68]  you can't say participated in that's even more english sorry so good sorry thank you
[13328.68 --> 13333.64]  yeah canadian english you correct someone and apologize
[13338.28 --> 13345.56]  i don't know how to define biggest most people there or what most important most important to
[13345.56 --> 13351.40]  you most important to who attended okay so attended i don't know like a hockey game i guess i don't
[13351.40 --> 13356.60]  attended seems lame skip attended what's okay participated i think uh because attended for all of us is
[13356.60 --> 13361.64]  going to be like hockey game i don't i don't is that incorrect i think he's english he's probably
[13361.64 --> 13368.04]  been to a footy game i think this is more of like have you been in with 13 crumpets perchance
[13368.84 --> 13376.20]  no there's just violence mostly violence and chanting it's like uh yeah no i think this is more um
[13376.20 --> 13383.32]  actually like if you competed in a in a hockey game or something like that yeah that's how i
[13383.32 --> 13388.44]  interpreted it but i yeah the attended just throw it off slightly but yeah absolutely i know what
[13388.44 --> 13393.88]  they mean by it they have 180 characters do we mean big in terms of number of attendees or big in
[13393.88 --> 13398.84]  terms of importance because you like one provincial championships and stuff right yeah like i've never
[13398.84 --> 13405.00]  done that i did nerd sports like i was never good at sports but nerd sports was sick it was sick
[13405.00 --> 13411.80]  it has more views than your provincial championship depending on where you put the line my my participation
[13411.80 --> 13417.00]  in nerd sports might be yeah more people watched you suck at hockey than watching you be good at hockey
[13419.48 --> 13421.00]  that's so sad but it's true
[13423.80 --> 13428.76]  i don't know uh probably the biggest one i like participated in somewhat decently would be maybe
[13428.76 --> 13434.36]  like a badminton tournament or something oh i'm so upset the upcoming badmintology team tournament i
[13434.36 --> 13440.68]  the timing just sucks for me like i don't have time to put together a squad or join a squad right now
[13440.68 --> 13449.56]  because i'm like busy just do it on the plane no i i'm not gonna be able to um like it fills up in
[13449.56 --> 13455.00]  like a day and they announced it like earlier today and people have been like putting together their
[13455.00 --> 13460.68]  teams all day and like i've been at work and also like i didn't already like kind of think oh yeah i guess
[13460.68 --> 13464.04]  that's coming up and like start putting things together so i think i'm just gonna miss it it
[13464.04 --> 13468.52]  sucks that sucks that was where that was when i got injured last year though so maybe it just is fine
[13470.44 --> 13477.08]  i've been like i'm still not fully recovered from tennis elbow from overuse at that tournament last year so
[13479.64 --> 13486.76]  linus instead of incrementally buying bigger and better tvs when are you going to just get the wall
[13486.76 --> 13495.56]  from samsung or for some micro led goodness man i gotta see them be seamless i have not seen those
[13495.56 --> 13501.16]  be a better experience yet yeah i um and also they're so much more expensive like yeah i could go
[13501.16 --> 13509.80]  from 115 to 136 i think uh what what are the different sizes of the wall these days the wall
[13509.80 --> 13517.16]  okay 11th studio album by english rock band pink floyd not what i was talking about great album
[13517.16 --> 13524.60]  stupid name for our tv okay here we go the ultimate visual experience for luxury completely modular right

[13532.68 --> 13539.48]  that they expect you to buy here shop now oh sorry i couldn't just buy like one panel for like sorry no
[13539.48 --> 13545.00]  items are available see the wall the bathroom or something so annoying why is this hard
[13547.08 --> 13554.68]  all in 130 inch 2k yeah no i'm gonna spend that kind of money and i'm not gonna go 4k you've got to be
[13554.68 --> 13560.12]  kidding me yeah and that's because these are commercial displays so it doesn't always make it shut up
[13560.12 --> 13567.00]  uh oh no am i oh am i just i'm just looking at this one right now what is happening right now direct
[13567.00 --> 13576.04]  view led okay we good well oh my god now i'm here lcd video wall shop now what a confusing website
[13576.04 --> 13584.36]  what just happened okay here we go this is a video wall how is this a video wall that's not a video wall
[13584.36 --> 13593.64]  that's a 55 inch commercial display why would you call it that ugh oh it has extremely narrow bezels i guess
[13594.76 --> 13598.20]  i guess i'll allow it wait that's it
[13601.16 --> 13603.96]  that's all of led video wall are you kidding me right now
[13607.16 --> 13613.32]  you cannot convince me that that was this is not a terrible website how did i end up so lost
[13614.36 --> 13621.32]  you managed to navigate to the business site well yeah because that's where i'm supposed to be
[13622.52 --> 13626.04]  it's part of their business thing also how do what do you mean i managed
[13628.60 --> 13635.96]  okay so let's go back to luxury living for luxury living okay okay i don't just want a brochure i want
[13635.96 --> 13641.56]  to i want to browse the site seamless design bold look okay we go all the way down all the way down all
[13641.56 --> 13647.40]  the way down shop the wall products buy now here we go and it just takes me to this one oh no this is
[13647.40 --> 13653.56]  it which one did i click last time for crying out loud okay direct view led i a series well how do i
[13653.56 --> 13659.56]  see the whole thing i don't just want the one oh i could i series here here okay are we good okay i think
[13659.56 --> 13667.16]  we're good wait what that that's it oh oh i can click here okay so they have a 110 inch i wouldn't get that
[13667.16 --> 13675.32]  that's like 1080p anyway so that's stupid so 146 inch 220 grand so what i'm gonna spend 220 000
[13675.32 --> 13681.08]  i'm gonna have seams in my display they say seamless can oh is this one seamless hold on a second
[13682.12 --> 13687.96]  is this one seamless anyway there's other drawbacks too i i truly don't know what the input leg is
[13688.76 --> 13694.76]  um but yeah cooling the room is a challenge these things draw mondo power and then maybe more
[13694.76 --> 13701.00]  importantly they're not actually necessarily better than the 115 inch that i have now in terms of
[13701.00 --> 13707.64]  performance and a big part of the reason for that is that they don't crank as bright surprising amount
[13707.64 --> 13713.24]  of reviews yeah no bad performance low price only 3000 hertz what what what what yes i recommend this
[13713.24 --> 13722.76]  product like clearly people are just trolling a bit big for a single bedroom apartment three stars like i would
[13722.76 --> 13728.60]  just ignore it is your fake they should do verified purchase there's no way that this isn't written by ai
[13730.84 --> 13738.52]  um yep this has got to be just someone's just written with ai probably a story like i don't think any of
[13738.52 --> 13744.60]  this is real i i would if i was samsung i would probably just turn off any not verified purchase reviews
[13744.60 --> 13751.96]  for a product like this because it's clearly not helping anyone yeah all i'm proposing tomorrow oh
[13751.96 --> 13758.68]  congratulations what were any of your i know that she's the one moments with your significant other
[13760.92 --> 13768.04]  she learned video games to spend time with me she did play some like very simple games like as a kid
[13768.04 --> 13775.88]  like dangerous dave was a favorite of yvonne's um but she like learned fps like shooter games to play them
[13775.88 --> 13781.80]  with me um that's that's a pretty solid sign she's a keeper also she stuck with me even though i was such a
[13781.80 --> 13789.64]  loser in university um there's a lot of the one moments for for me i don't know what hers were
[13792.60 --> 13797.16]  like i must be a lot better looking than i think i am or something because really like i was
[13797.16 --> 13800.20]  irredeemable early on i don't i don't get what she was thinking
[13802.76 --> 13808.52]  hey wanda dlo question for luke when buying things like sporting equipment or tools for yourself how do you
[13808.52 --> 13812.60]  balance cost and quality see this is what now i'm gonna lose my cheapness
[13815.08 --> 13825.08]  flag trait i don't know what you want to call it truth um i i generally okay maybe i won't completely
[13825.72 --> 13832.76]  lose it i tend to buy less stuff but i try to buy better things i go with the whole like try to buy
[13832.76 --> 13840.76]  something that's going to last basically forever um option um i like to think that the tools that
[13840.76 --> 13846.44]  i have bought are generally pretty good i'll spend time and research them um like the drills the the
[13846.44 --> 13852.76]  drills that i bought when i finally was like okay i need to have my own drills um brand milwaukee brushless
[13852.76 --> 13860.60]  i was quite happy about that purchase you get a pass um and i i yeah i try to do that for things so
[13860.60 --> 13867.88]  i yeah fewer of them better things is usually what i try to do buy the cheap one from harbor freight and
[13867.88 --> 13873.16]  then when it breaks get the most expensive one you can and i have done that yeah or just borrow them
[13873.16 --> 13887.00]  from work holy dangerous dave that john romero yeah yeah yeah for sure oh i had no idea yeah
[13889.72 --> 13896.36]  all right let's play some dangerous dave shall we how do i uh how do i start okay what why are we
[13896.36 --> 13904.36]  dangerous dave that's the game that yvonne had liked yeah oh okay yep this this was like yvonne's gaming
[13905.40 --> 13914.36]  chops when i met her and it is really hard um like the way the fall physics if you could call them that
[13914.36 --> 13921.32]  work um it's got air control that's kind of thing it's it's pretty rough there's only 10 levels um but
[13922.04 --> 13929.48]  getting through them is quite difficult yes chat by the way i did hear you um i will i will call yvonne
[13929.48 --> 13936.52]  we can ask her how do you get that ruby i don't think you're meant to oh it's just bait oh balls
[13938.04 --> 13943.56]  it it's hard i promise it's legitimately very hard oh my god
[13943.56 --> 13950.84]  i've been trying to think about mine for for emma by the way and i think there was um when my when
[13950.84 --> 13958.52]  my grandpa was passing away we we had to go down to arizona um and i didn't even ask her to go i
[13958.52 --> 13966.20]  didn't expect her to go uh but she went and she was a absolute trooper the whole time she did so much
[13967.16 --> 13972.28]  work like we were clearing out his house and like my mom and i had to go through a bunch of his documents
[13972.28 --> 13976.92]  and figure what we needed to shred and do whatever else and she disappeared for a few hours and i
[13976.92 --> 13981.40]  assumed like i don't know what she's doing whatever sounds good and then when she came back she was like
[13981.40 --> 13989.72]  well i cleaned out the entire garage and it was just like what nice okay she was going hard the whole time
[13989.72 --> 13993.00]  uh and that was actually very cool all right
[13999.48 --> 14008.12]  hey hey you're uh live on the wan show so um chat was asking like when was my like you know you know
[14008.12 --> 14012.44]  she's the one moment with you and i was kind of talking about you like learning left for dead just
[14012.44 --> 14017.88]  to like play games with me and stuff like that uh and oh my god i'm trying to play dangerous dave right
[14017.88 --> 14025.16]  now i'm about to get my ah dang it it it really is dangerous dangerous game yeah don't don't worry
[14025.16 --> 14031.32]  about it the point is that uh i was talking about how what i wasn't really sure what my redeeming
[14031.32 --> 14037.40]  quality oh for crying out loud that bloody spider um i wasn't sure what my redeeming qualities were
[14037.96 --> 14042.36]  um and they wanted to know what your like how you knew moments were
[14042.36 --> 14048.68]  um oh man yeah right tough i think a really long time back
[14051.16 --> 14052.76]  oh that's brutal
[14054.76 --> 14055.96]  sorry he's talking about dangerous
[14055.96 --> 14059.24]  not you yeah yeah no no no i figured
[14060.52 --> 14066.20]  um honestly i feel like i was a dumb girl back then and i was just in love
[14066.20 --> 14070.44]  all right thanks that's kind of what i expected to hear it doesn't make it easier but
[14071.48 --> 14080.04]  not unexpected no i mean i knew you were smart and you challenged me and i i liked that we were
[14080.04 --> 14086.52]  able to communicate and talk about things that we don't like that's not easy to talk about um
[14086.52 --> 14097.88]  um i liked that you were like remember so far i know english sorry so far i know english um smart
[14097.88 --> 14105.32]  to communicate yeah um you were very charming which i feel like is sometimes the opposite of me and i
[14105.32 --> 14111.96]  needed that like not just charming but like really laid back um in some ways not not every way
[14111.96 --> 14118.68]  yeah it's not usually balanced to me if that makes sense you were like you know we talk about yin and
[14118.68 --> 14124.20]  yang they're opposites but they like mesh well together okay so we got yvonne being responsible
[14124.20 --> 14129.72]  and stable and we've got me being probably the first time i've ever heard you described as laid back
[14129.72 --> 14139.24]  yeah well i mean i was pretty high strung it's all relative it's all relative yeah okay yeah like i'm
[14139.24 --> 14145.96]  i'm i'm much more uh easy going now but okay i feel like in some ways i was high strung because of you
[14145.96 --> 14154.28]  though so i don't know all right i think that's probably enough of this for now
[14156.04 --> 14159.96]  okay all right see you soon love oh that's really funny bye
[14161.72 --> 14168.12]  that's very funny i mean it's about yeah i'm not gonna lie about what i expected but um there you
[14168.12 --> 14175.80]  have it you heard it from the horse's mouth up next as requested making good use of the gift card
[14175.80 --> 14180.84]  before the holiday season uh thank you thank you actually a lot of people have been using the gift
[14180.84 --> 14186.44]  cards appreciate that legitimately they thought they would save them but they can't help themselves
[14186.44 --> 14191.40]  as requested making good use of the gift card before the holiday season any of y'all have halloween
[14191.40 --> 14200.36]  outfits planned no um i haven't had a halloween outfit since uh we had the house the house was
[14200.36 --> 14204.92]  our office and i scared people on the porch well people are so upset they're like don't call your
[14204.92 --> 14209.24]  wife a horse what do you think a ho is short for oh my god no i
[14209.24 --> 14216.84]  don't miss direct him you missed you gotta misdirection when did you know it's an expression
[14216.84 --> 14221.08]  from the horse's mouth like it just means from the source oh yeah i wouldn't have yeah no i know i
[14221.08 --> 14227.96]  know that's not a ding that wasn't a pun no it was a joke dings are not for puns they're for dad jokes
[14227.96 --> 14240.20]  exactly oh oh yeah oh dude i'm in such rough shape i did a um the my son's taekwondo school like
[14240.20 --> 14246.44]  no disrespect to taekwondo but it's not like a serious fighting martial art for the most part um
[14247.56 --> 14253.00]  but i still wanted the kids to like learn martial arts it's good for you know discipline and good to
[14253.00 --> 14258.92]  learn to stick with something until you you know get your black belt it's good socially it's good
[14258.92 --> 14262.76]  it's good good for lots of things it's good for getting you out of your shell a little bit i my
[14262.76 --> 14269.48]  kids can tend to be a little bit shy sometimes and i think you know forcing them to you know shout and
[14269.48 --> 14273.96]  and practice sparring just there's a lot of things that i think it can be really helpful for
[14273.96 --> 14276.92]  developmentally i'm not saying it's for everyone but i'm saying it's something that
[14276.92 --> 14282.12]  i believed in so all my kids have had to do taekwondo um anyway the point is that the instructor
[14282.12 --> 14290.20]  uh before this particular organization converted to taekwondo uh used to uh train under something
[14290.20 --> 14297.64]  under the same you know master or whatever but it used to be called um something combat something and
[14297.64 --> 14306.28]  it was like very street brawler how to break bones and um and get away kind of and so i had actually
[14306.28 --> 14310.76]  asked him because my son's been losing a little bit of interest with the the taekwondo side of things
[14310.76 --> 14315.48]  and so i i asked the instructor i was like hey do you want to do like some privates with us and do
[14315.48 --> 14322.84]  some more like some more like grappling some more submissions uh some more like like more
[14323.88 --> 14329.40]  stuff you don't teach the kids like you know neck takedowns and and stuff like that and he's like
[14330.04 --> 14338.76]  i'd love to um you know he's a super cool guy anyway the point is that i had a i had a session with him
[14338.76 --> 14350.04]  on um wednesday no no uh what was it wednesday yeah i had no what what day are things yeah i had a
[14350.04 --> 14355.88]  session with him on wednesday night um right after work so i had a long day at work and then my son and
[14355.88 --> 14363.96]  i went and did like like like a bunch of like neck takedowns uh choke holds neck submissions choke hold
[14363.96 --> 14371.32]  counters and like basically a bunch of stuff and so thursday i had a long drive to an amd ultimate
[14371.32 --> 14378.92]  tech upgrade long day amd ultimate tech upgrade and then uh oh sorry no first wednesday after after
[14378.92 --> 14384.52]  the training i went and i had badminton training for two hours so just like multi feeds if you guys are
[14384.52 --> 14391.08]  wondering what that looks like um basically uh you can check out the badminton insight channel
[14393.88 --> 14401.16]  we did a collab with them where they had me train like a pro for a day um it's pretty brutal but
[14401.16 --> 14407.80]  basically this is not was not me uh i'm in i'm in all black here and i mostly looked like that but
[14407.80 --> 14415.40]  you you go pretty hard so you you basically are just running getting stuff sometimes missing them
[14415.40 --> 14420.92]  the point is it's pretty tough and then yesterday i had ladder so i had competitive ladder i am like
[14420.92 --> 14429.08]  i'm dying my body is dead this is the ghost of me it's my halloween costume it's pretty good yeah um
[14429.72 --> 14434.44]  like i could barely shoulder check in my car on thursday and then i had to go play ladder that night
[14434.44 --> 14441.32]  it was not i do i lost five out of my six games i dropped like 100 elo points i'm so upset like
[14441.32 --> 14448.04]  actually very upset i should have just not even played yeah probably not linus what difficulty do
[14448.04 --> 14454.60]  you recommend for ano 1800 i am still struggling with outpacing expert ai love the show whatever you
[14454.60 --> 14462.04]  enjoy ano is fun if you're not having fun just turn it down it's fine the high difficulty ai also
[14462.04 --> 14468.36]  extremely cheats yeah that's something that's always been a problem for ano games like even
[14468.36 --> 14473.56]  going back to the very first one uh which had exhaustible iron mines and every map would only
[14473.56 --> 14481.24]  have like a couple iron mines so your your ability to acquire iron was like extremely limited um it's
[14481.24 --> 14485.72]  kind of like like warcraft 2 and gold mines like there's just there's no freaking gold on the map
[14486.60 --> 14491.08]  nah that wasn't that big of a problem in warcraft 2 much worse much worse than gold in warcraft 2 but
[14491.08 --> 14497.24]  you've got this finite resource compared to um something like supreme commander where the
[14497.24 --> 14502.84]  resources are are infinite and it's just a question of like how you manage your economy so you've got
[14502.84 --> 14507.80]  this like finite iron resource the biggest problem that i noticed was they wouldn't have access to a
[14507.80 --> 14512.28]  certain resource that would allow them to build the thing yet would just have it and there was
[14512.28 --> 14518.36]  explanations like maybe they got it through trading but then even if you like laser watched their base like
[14518.36 --> 14524.12]  no yeah so so they would just so all the iron on the map would be exhausted
[14524.84 --> 14529.96]  but they would like still be able to build stuff with iron it's just like come on i don't like that
[14531.00 --> 14535.08]  yeah i so i don't i don't love those forms of difficulty yeah but i mean realistically ano can
[14535.08 --> 14541.00]  be enjoyed in any way you can play against the eyes against people you can just spawn a new world and just
[14541.00 --> 14548.44]  build it's it's a great game oh yep there's a ton of people that play on the minimum difficulty i think
[14548.44 --> 14558.52]  they call it beauty building no uh what's it called shoot it has a name tiny glade what i don't know
[14558.52 --> 14565.40]  what that's just that's a game where you build pretty cottages okay oh um man why can i not remember what
[14565.40 --> 14572.36]  it's called are you sure it's not called beauty building yeah i don't think so i think it's called
[14572.36 --> 14581.64]  something else i maybe you're right beauty build city city beauty building i mean i did search there
[14581.64 --> 14586.52]  are people that say beauty building but i searched beauty building so i don't know if that's like i was
[14586.52 --> 14594.28]  gonna say the same thing yeah yeah all right anyways there's a there's a pretty large subset of
[14594.28 --> 14598.04]  people that play on the lowest difficulty and then just try to make really cool looking cities instead
[14598.04 --> 14601.64]  of the most efficient cities and then some people play on higher difficulties and try to make the
[14601.64 --> 14606.92]  most efficient cities i even know some people play on minimum difficulty and try to make obsessively
[14606.92 --> 14610.60]  efficient cities and they just don't worry about the difficulty of the game while doing that
[14611.48 --> 14614.04]  apparently it's called beauty building sure i don't know
[14614.04 --> 14617.96]  every build is a beauty build because this game is beautiful
[14621.00 --> 14626.68]  build beauty building uh packs for mana demos out right now launched during steam next fest i could
[14626.68 --> 14630.60]  have sworn it was called something else okay well it shows you there might be another name for it i
[14630.60 --> 14637.16]  don't know i mean this seems to be a thing this seems to be a thing i don't know i don't know okay
[14637.16 --> 14649.88]  how do you deal with a product you like being bought out by a company that you're morally or ethically opposed to for example ea or more specifically battlefield 6
[14651.00 --> 14657.96]  it's tough and it's becoming tougher in this increasingly consolidated world where
[14657.96 --> 14666.44]  the companies that make the products that you enjoy are increasingly owned by giant objectively evil
[14666.44 --> 14676.92]  multinational corps or owned by nations with very questionable track records around human rights and
[14676.92 --> 14686.44]  um extrajudicial killings and all kinds of truly horrible things there's also problem this is unrelated to what
[14686.44 --> 14691.00]  they're talking about with bf6 but it is related to the whole company and ethics thing there's also like
[14692.44 --> 14700.44]  there seems to be a bias towards avoiding the loud ones instead of necessarily avoiding the worst ones
[14700.44 --> 14706.76]  yeah uh which is also interesting i don't know it's it's tough you gotta pick your own lines
[14707.72 --> 14713.40]  um and trying to assume that everyone else is going to pick the exact same lines is just going to lead you to be
[14713.40 --> 14721.24]  frustrated needlessly so don't do that but um yeah pick a line if that's your line then that's your line
[14723.40 --> 14728.36]  hey fellas after seeing the server video i was curious about the process of upgrading servers
[14728.36 --> 14733.88]  i imagine upgrading is very expensive and requires new cooling solutions how often do they do that
[14733.88 --> 14744.76]  cooling solutions no i i wouldn't for the most part like cooling solution or the whole thing upgrading servers
[14745.80 --> 14753.48]  like we've definitely done it over the years but that's a very small business thing to do large businesses
[14753.48 --> 14759.40]  enterprise data center like you run it as long as the total cost of ownership makes sense
[14759.40 --> 14768.28]  and then you decommission it i wow that's actually very interesting because i didn't even interpret it that way
[14768.92 --> 14775.40]  i interpreted upgrading servers as replacing servers yeah exactly i didn't even think about yeah
[14777.00 --> 14783.40]  now when you are replacing servers and you're upgrading the cooling in the data center if that's what you're asking about
[14783.40 --> 14790.84]  that is a huge problem we actually discussed that very briefly in the sfu supercomputer great video by the way
[14790.84 --> 14797.88]  oh yeah i kind of figured that one would have gotten your attention yep um so because they have so little power going into that building
[14798.20 --> 14804.60]  i mean to be clear they thought it was a lot back in the day it used to be apparently like the the control center for
[14805.48 --> 14808.92]  uh all the bc hydro like power for the lower half of our province like
[14808.92 --> 14815.64]  it was built with lots of power and networking or whatever but then these new ai servers came out and
[14815.64 --> 14822.28]  all of a sudden they had to reroute i think i think it's like don't quote me on this but i think it's like
[14822.28 --> 14827.88]  a third of the power going into the data center for just the gpu servers that are just like this like
[14827.88 --> 14835.16]  one row and they're not even full to full density like to actually build a fully built out fully dense
[14835.16 --> 14842.92]  ai data center would require this just utterly obscene power density like it's like it's insane
[14842.92 --> 14843.72]  um
[14845.80 --> 14852.52]  and it was it was a big problem they actually had to take down a bunch of nodes in order to
[14853.08 --> 14859.08]  completely reroute all of the networking and power from one side of the data center to the other in order to even do this deployment and
[14859.08 --> 14861.80]  consolidate enough of it that it could that it could be done
[14861.80 --> 14869.00]  uh huge huge problem and like the the cooling that they added so they added um three more of those
[14869.00 --> 14874.28]  evaporative cooling towers that they have outside and they were what i think they said 1.2 million a
[14874.28 --> 14881.40]  pop or something like that to handle the additional heat load spicy and to be clear like it it happens
[14881.40 --> 14886.84]  d hollinger in chat said uh that really depends these days with the constant security issues we tend to have
[14886.84 --> 14891.64]  to do it quite often but yes from a hardware perspective usually just replace a physical server but not always
[14891.64 --> 14898.12]  and like with with even the like location services we've used with like ovh or whatever else
[14898.12 --> 14907.56]  um we've had individual servers that we are using get upgraded upgraded usually the problem is
[14907.56 --> 14912.44]  drives are dying and then they just use that opportunity to upgrade things or whatever else but
[14913.88 --> 14918.44]  yeah in my experience it's usually swapping out the whole the whole server
[14918.44 --> 14925.88]  last one i got for you here linus how have the first few days of your 40th year on this
[14925.88 --> 14933.96]  point been going not yet not yet still in my 30s barely hanging on any updates on the full install
[14933.96 --> 14939.96]  of your new light switches no i need to follow that up we've um we've got a bunch of really good
[14940.68 --> 14947.40]  sort of home stuff going i still have the list to work on um and there's some new members of the
[14947.40 --> 14951.80]  writing team that you guys will be meeting after they complete their probation assuming that they do
[14951.80 --> 14958.44]  knock on wood um and i'm very excited for some new home automation stuff at my house also some really
[14958.44 --> 14965.88]  cool stuff for the tech house one of the new guys actually flagged these um heat pump water heaters
[14965.88 --> 14972.28]  which i didn't know was a thing but i guess makes sense if you can heat water with gas you could
[14972.28 --> 14977.64]  probably also heat water with a heat pump uh but it just has like a like an hvac system on the top of
[14977.64 --> 14981.40]  it and then the water tank under it yeah pretty cool so we're going to be looking for all kinds of
[14981.40 --> 14988.36]  cool things he also flagged a um a smart panel to me so instead of putting smart breakers into a dumb
[14988.36 --> 14992.68]  panel you just have a smart panel and it can do all kinds of cool stuff like you could tell it
[14992.68 --> 14999.32]  hey if we're if we're at the limit then kill these ones because i don't need them that bad
[14999.32 --> 15003.16]  so for something like whale land that could be amazing that would be really good yeah right
[15004.04 --> 15010.28]  whale lands power situation is getting interesting oh crap pretty jank says you are 39 meaning you are
[15010.28 --> 15011.72]  living in your 40th year linus
[15014.92 --> 15016.28]  right uh
[15016.28 --> 15016.84]  uh
[15018.84 --> 15022.76]  well that's depressing and i still haven't learned math but you're not there yet
[15023.40 --> 15029.00]  no i am yeah but you're not at the 40th yet well i'm not finished the 40th i'm in my 40th which
[15029.00 --> 15034.36]  is what they but how most people consider it well most people is a very western centric point of view
[15035.56 --> 15039.72]  sure no they they do they you know they number it differently you are western
[15039.72 --> 15045.88]  yeehaw so it would follow how you do it would it not thanks for watching the wan show see you
[15045.88 --> 15050.84]  again next week same bad time same bad channel yippee-ki-yay motherfucker okay bye
[15050.84 --> 15064.68]  merry christmas
[15075.56 --> 15079.56]  you
