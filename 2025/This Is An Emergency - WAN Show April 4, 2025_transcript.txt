[0.00 --> 2.18]  Jeez! Let's go, let's go!
[2.18 --> 2.92]  No, it's real!
[16.34 --> 16.86]  Oh.
[30.00 --> 53.08]  We're going to be talking about April Fools this year.
[53.08 --> 58.62]  It was an incredible effort from the entire team, especially one Mr. David Gauthier.
[58.62 --> 66.94]  We're also going to be talking about the emergency for your wallet that is the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.
[68.10 --> 73.82]  $450 for a Nintendo console? Unheard of. Or is it?
[74.24 --> 81.10]  We're also going to be talking about China mass-producing coin-sized nuclear batteries and something.
[81.54 --> 85.78]  Tariffs? Intel and TSMC working together? Joint partnership? Something.
[86.44 --> 87.24]  We'll talk about someone else.
[87.24 --> 89.32]  Yeah, and I just got to find the thing.
[90.46 --> 90.86]  Nice.
[94.86 --> 95.18]  Oh, no.
[95.68 --> 96.14]  Shit.
[96.14 --> 122.00]  The show is brought to you today by Squarespace, Forum, Notion, and of course, our usual wrap partner, Dbrand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner.
[122.00 --> 124.00]  They're there.
[124.00 --> 124.50]  They're there.
[124.50 --> 125.00]  Are they there?
[125.00 --> 126.22]  There's cushions in the front window.
[126.22 --> 128.82]  Nice, nice. Our chair partner, Secret Lab. Let's go.
[128.82 --> 129.32]  Yeah.
[129.32 --> 131.16]  Uh, I'm just going to turn this off now.
[131.84 --> 134.96]  Um, before we... where is it?
[134.96 --> 136.56]  I think it's probably easier if you open the door.
[136.72 --> 137.02]  Yeah.
[137.56 --> 138.44]  Oh, Lordy.
[138.44 --> 140.44]  There you go.
[140.44 --> 140.56]  There we go.
[140.56 --> 147.94]  So, I was thinking you could do... I don't know if you'd want to, but you could do a mod where you swap in Secret Lab chairs.
[148.28 --> 153.48]  Yeah, we could do that, but I think that's not going to be on the agenda for today.
[153.66 --> 153.88]  No.
[153.88 --> 162.00]  Well, let's go ahead and jump right into our first topic, which I think has got to be the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.
[162.10 --> 169.42]  Now, obviously, there's no way that you, Nintendo fanboy that you are, are going to be missing a Nintendo Direct.
[169.72 --> 178.12]  So, what were your impressions before they started talking about all the icky price details?
[178.12 --> 183.08]  Uh, I thought it was pretty cool. I did skip through it. I didn't actually watch the whole thing.
[183.54 --> 186.08]  Um, I thought the camera...
[186.08 --> 192.30]  It might get some use, but that doesn't seem like a huge killer feature to me.
[192.64 --> 198.24]  Uh, I think having chat, however, really bad sounding, I don't know if you noticed that,
[198.44 --> 205.30]  but I think having chat built into the console is probably good if they weren't going to try to do a partnership with, like, external chat programs like Discord or whatever else.
[205.30 --> 214.46]  Um, the dock actually having performance implications, like the dock having a fan in it, which could help keep the system cool,
[214.56 --> 218.68]  which could help keep performance high, seems genuinely actually pretty cool.
[219.18 --> 222.90]  Um, and the launch titles seem pretty strong.
[223.38 --> 225.30]  Um, Mario Kart World...
[226.16 --> 230.98]  I don't know how excited I am about, like, free roam driving in Mario Kart.
[231.14 --> 234.40]  I don't know if I care about that at all, to be completely honest.
[234.40 --> 239.02]  Um, but the game does look pretty cool. Seems like it supports a lot of players.
[239.46 --> 241.90]  I like some of the new modes that they're talking about.
[242.32 --> 246.82]  And considering the Switch's Mario Kart was just a rehash of the Mario Kart from the Wii U,
[247.20 --> 253.62]  uh, it's been kind of a hot minute since we've had an actually genuinely new Mario Kart game.
[253.76 --> 255.60]  So that's, that's cool. That's exciting.
[256.22 --> 256.78]  Um...
[256.78 --> 257.14]  Okay.
[257.14 --> 261.16]  Why don't we talk about the awkward details, though?
[261.18 --> 261.42]  Do you want to say this?
[262.06 --> 268.42]  Uh, actually, I mean, should we, should we do a bit more of a roundup of everything that we know about the Switch 2 so far?
[268.50 --> 268.66]  Sure.
[268.66 --> 274.58]  Uh, based on the rumored specs from earlier leaks, uh, which still seem to probably be accurate,
[274.72 --> 279.96]  we're expecting a semi-custom 5-nanometer variant of the Tegra T239.
[280.22 --> 286.96]  So, eight ARM cores, um, some of which are, one of which is high performance, three of which are performance,
[287.14 --> 288.68]  and four of which are efficiency cores.
[289.12 --> 294.76]  A hundred, uh, excuse me, 12 gigs of LPDDR5X at 7,500 megatransfers per second.
[294.76 --> 296.40]  So that is fast memory.
[296.70 --> 300.60]  I was surprised to see how much local storage it's getting.
[302.00 --> 302.90]  256 gigs.
[303.10 --> 308.92]  Like, typically, Nintendo has been, um, very Apple-like in their hardware.
[309.06 --> 310.22]  I, or I shouldn't say typically.
[310.38 --> 314.20]  I mean, the Wii U was a pretty decent little piece of kit for the price.
[314.42 --> 314.52]  Yeah.
[314.66 --> 320.64]  But the Switch, which is the most recent example, was ancient when it was released.
[321.32 --> 323.98]  Extremely ungenerous in terms of specifications.
[323.98 --> 327.62]  Whereas this time around, 256 gigs of storage.
[327.80 --> 334.34]  And now that we've seen the sizes of some of these games, it looks like while you can expand it with a microSD card,
[334.68 --> 337.02]  a lot of people probably won't need to.
[337.82 --> 339.28]  Especially at the cost of the games.
[339.46 --> 342.80]  But we'll get to the cost of the games in a sec.
[342.80 --> 346.10]  The big highlight is, of course, the new Ampere GPU.
[346.58 --> 354.46]  1536 CUDA cores, 12 SMs, um, 8th Gen NVENC encoding hardware, uh, RTX ray tracing support,
[354.46 --> 359.80]  and, of course, Gen 3 Tensor cores that are going to enable AI upscaling.
[359.80 --> 367.44]  I don't see anything about, um, AI frame generation.
[368.02 --> 373.96]  NVIDIA did say in a blog post that the Switch 2 has 10 times the graphics performance of the OG.
[374.50 --> 375.44]  Um, and...
[375.44 --> 382.72]  There was a tweet from, like, the head of DLSS about there being DLSS on the Switch.
[382.80 --> 384.68]  But not necessarily frame gen.
[385.16 --> 386.34]  No, okay, I see what you mean.
[386.34 --> 387.30]  So that's what I don't know.
[387.52 --> 392.00]  But what I will say is that I was looking as closely as I could,
[392.14 --> 395.90]  considering that we were dealing with, you know, YouTube compression, right?
[395.90 --> 399.50]  I was looking as closely as I could at some of the gameplay footage,
[399.64 --> 405.96]  and I didn't see, personally, um, any of the telltale signs of frame generation.
[406.22 --> 406.30]  Yeah.
[406.54 --> 410.26]  Um, even though it'd be pretty much impossible to tell, uh,
[410.34 --> 412.62]  what degree of AI upscaling they're doing,
[412.68 --> 416.04]  if we're looking at performance upscaling or quality level upscaling.
[416.26 --> 419.00]  And I suspect that's going to vary depending on the title,
[419.10 --> 420.50]  especially for third-party titles.
[421.76 --> 424.08]  Um, voice chat, man.
[424.98 --> 425.38]  Okay.
[425.38 --> 426.08]  I think it's good.
[426.08 --> 429.26]  I wish it was with third-party providers,
[429.40 --> 432.64]  but I kind of understand from a family-friendly standpoint
[432.64 --> 434.88]  that it might be more controllable if it's not.
[435.30 --> 436.48]  So tell me this.
[437.64 --> 439.60]  How do you feel about the fact that,
[439.70 --> 441.04]  and as far as I can tell,
[441.58 --> 442.70]  as far as I can tell,
[443.04 --> 445.78]  it seems like the chat function doesn't work
[445.78 --> 447.42]  unless you have a subscription.
[448.72 --> 450.36]  So you hadn't caught that.
[450.70 --> 451.18]  Okay.
[451.70 --> 453.86]  I didn't either prior to our video.
[453.92 --> 454.46]  Does that make sense?
[454.46 --> 457.12]  Is there any online multiplayer on the Switch without a subscription?
[459.86 --> 460.98]  I have to confess,
[461.18 --> 463.98]  I have never subscribed to Nintendo Online.
[464.10 --> 464.30]  Me neither.
[464.38 --> 465.08]  Out of principle.
[465.22 --> 465.66]  Me too.
[465.66 --> 468.94]  I didn't actually know that,
[469.00 --> 469.22]  but yeah,
[469.26 --> 469.76]  I haven't either.
[470.12 --> 470.52]  No.
[471.94 --> 472.34]  No.
[473.08 --> 475.28]  You need to have Nintendo Online.
[475.30 --> 475.50]  Yeah.
[475.50 --> 475.82]  So that,
[475.94 --> 476.12]  I mean,
[476.16 --> 477.40]  that kind of makes sense then.
[477.70 --> 477.92]  Okay.
[477.92 --> 479.16]  So if you're doing anything online,
[479.22 --> 480.58]  you're going to have a subscription anyways.
[480.58 --> 481.54]  Oh,
[482.80 --> 483.00]  no,
[483.02 --> 483.10]  no,
[483.10 --> 483.12]  no,
[483.12 --> 483.24]  no,
[483.24 --> 483.26]  no.
[483.26 --> 484.18]  It's worse than that.
[484.62 --> 486.96]  According to the mighty Reptar,
[487.40 --> 492.16]  it is free to all Nintendo Online subscribers for the first year.
[492.34 --> 492.72]  Wait,
[492.84 --> 494.20]  chat's an additional fee?
[494.32 --> 497.64]  Then chat is apparently going to go behind a paywall.
[497.64 --> 501.38]  So then they're going to just keep doing what everyone that I know has been doing,
[501.48 --> 503.42]  which is where you discord on your phone.
[503.92 --> 504.32]  Yeah.
[504.90 --> 506.72]  And just play games on your Switch.
[506.96 --> 508.96]  Because why pay more for Nintendo chat?
[509.00 --> 509.54]  That's crazy.
[510.14 --> 510.52]  Ooh,
[510.58 --> 511.28]  that's rough.
[511.32 --> 512.38]  Some people will do it.
[513.02 --> 513.32]  So,
[513.72 --> 514.34]  man,
[514.42 --> 514.78]  we're almost,
[514.92 --> 515.18]  we're not,
[515.24 --> 518.28]  we're not quite there in terms of going through all the interesting stuff,
[518.28 --> 520.84]  but we're getting lots of people discussing this in the,
[520.92 --> 521.40]  in the chat.
[521.48 --> 523.22]  So I want to talk about this as well.
[523.88 --> 524.24]  Um,
[524.80 --> 525.08]  oh wait,
[525.16 --> 525.60]  where'd it go?
[525.98 --> 526.50]  Oh no,
[526.66 --> 526.86]  no,
[526.92 --> 527.52]  where'd it go?
[528.22 --> 528.88]  Where'd it go?
[529.08 --> 530.30]  People are asking where Dan is.
[530.34 --> 532.02]  Do you want to do the reveal now or should we do it?
[532.02 --> 532.10]  Nah,
[532.12 --> 533.22]  we'll do the reveal later.
[533.24 --> 533.42]  All right,
[533.46 --> 533.94]  you guys will see later.
[533.94 --> 535.02]  When we talk about merch messages.
[535.52 --> 536.36]  It's pretty cool though.
[536.42 --> 537.68]  When we talk about merch messages.
[538.26 --> 538.58]  Oh,
[538.64 --> 539.00]  shoot.
[539.18 --> 539.38]  Well,
[539.56 --> 540.52]  I missed it.
[540.54 --> 541.04]  Oh yes,
[541.14 --> 541.30]  no,
[541.36 --> 541.78]  I remember.
[542.16 --> 542.46]  Okay.
[542.92 --> 544.14]  As someone who also,
[544.32 --> 544.62]  so my,
[544.62 --> 547.42]  my on principle for not subscribing to Nintendo Online,
[547.52 --> 547.92]  because I,
[547.92 --> 549.78]  I'll subscribe to subscription services.
[549.78 --> 550.00]  I,
[550.08 --> 551.20]  I have subscription services,
[551.20 --> 552.36]  but for me,
[552.36 --> 553.20]  the one that really,
[553.20 --> 561.50]  really upset me and that made me unwilling to give them money for it was the fact that they lock my save game backups behind Nintendo Online.
[561.58 --> 562.18]  That's complete BS.
[562.20 --> 564.82]  We are talking about a console that literally has a,
[564.86 --> 567.08]  has an SD card slot in the front of it.
[567.24 --> 577.70]  There is absolutely no technological reason why I couldn't back up my save game data to the same physical media that I could easily put a game onto.
[577.70 --> 579.00]  You have got to be kidding me.
[579.00 --> 579.24]  You have got to be kidding me.
[579.36 --> 582.06]  And my understanding is that is still how it works.
[582.18 --> 584.04]  If that is not how it works anymore,
[584.04 --> 589.42]  then I would consider subscribing to Nintendo Online for some of the cool stuff that it has.
[589.42 --> 590.42]  But that is,
[590.42 --> 591.42]  that is,
[591.42 --> 592.42]  that is completely,
[592.42 --> 597.16]  that is completely uncool for a device that a,
[598.10 --> 598.40]  you know,
[598.56 --> 599.68]  is not perfect,
[599.96 --> 600.66]  could fail,
[600.88 --> 601.08]  right?
[601.14 --> 603.36]  And therefore could lose my save games.
[603.48 --> 609.84]  And B is portable and much more likely to be lost than something like a living room console.
[609.84 --> 613.08]  So there's a bunch of people posting corrections,
[613.24 --> 615.10]  but it's really not that different than what we said.
[615.18 --> 616.40]  They're saying important correction,
[616.98 --> 617.58]  questionable.
[618.08 --> 618.32]  Uh,
[618.32 --> 622.84]  game chat is included in all Nintendo Online chat subscriptions and is free for all users until,
[622.84 --> 624.22]  um,
[624.30 --> 625.54]  March of 2026.
[625.70 --> 626.18]  So it's,
[626.24 --> 628.94]  it's just free for a little bit longer than we said.
[629.14 --> 629.38]  Okay.
[629.56 --> 629.88]  All right.
[629.90 --> 630.46]  It's still a,
[630.46 --> 631.10]  that is,
[631.18 --> 632.30]  that is a good distinction.
[632.50 --> 633.34]  That is a good distinction.
[633.34 --> 636.64]  It is something that I actually missed in the initial with,
[636.64 --> 636.82]  just,
[636.94 --> 641.40]  I had other stuff to do that day and I'm usually being briefed on like multiple things a day.
[641.48 --> 642.36]  So I missed that.
[642.46 --> 643.20]  That was one of the reasons.
[643.22 --> 644.80]  People are saying it's not extra on top.
[644.92 --> 645.70]  I don't get that.
[645.88 --> 646.06]  Yeah.
[646.12 --> 647.72]  So it's included with Nintendo Online,
[647.86 --> 649.44]  but free for everyone for,
[649.62 --> 650.10]  uh,
[650.18 --> 651.24]  until March next year.
[651.42 --> 651.58]  But,
[652.10 --> 653.56]  so you can get live chat,
[653.64 --> 654.98]  but not Nintendo Online.
[655.12 --> 656.24]  So you can't play games together,
[656.34 --> 658.18]  but you have to get Nintendo Online and they're,
[658.24 --> 658.72]  they're bundled.
[659.38 --> 660.74]  It sounds like they're just bundled.
[661.18 --> 663.04]  So speaking of Nintendo Online,
[663.76 --> 666.46]  what is your reason for not subscribing to Nintendo Online?
[666.64 --> 667.08]  Um,
[667.08 --> 670.80]  it feels a little ridiculous to me.
[670.86 --> 674.28]  And I don't actually know what the current state of online multiplayer is on the other consoles.
[674.50 --> 677.16]  I have no interest in it in any of the other consoles at all.
[677.22 --> 680.30]  The only reason why I'd be interested in console games at this point is single player ones.
[680.58 --> 680.94]  Uh,
[680.94 --> 688.18]  but it feels ridiculous to me in 2025 to have to pay a subscription to be able to play any game online at all.
[688.30 --> 690.42]  Like that's enough of a line for me.
[690.82 --> 691.52]  And again,
[691.52 --> 692.46]  if I want something,
[692.50 --> 693.14]  I'll pay a subscription.
[693.14 --> 694.98]  The most interesting thing to me,
[694.98 --> 700.82]  I guess it's been access to some of their games that they put on that service,
[700.82 --> 703.94]  but then I don't like paying subscriptions to access games either.
[704.54 --> 705.10]  Um,
[705.10 --> 706.04]  I'd rather just buy it.
[706.58 --> 706.74]  Okay.
[707.00 --> 707.32]  So,
[707.42 --> 707.92]  so,
[707.92 --> 720.26]  Nintendo's strategy for combating scalpers involves gating pre-orders to people who have 12 months of Nintendo Online in their history.
[720.44 --> 721.40]  Is it actually?
[721.40 --> 722.58]  Oh,
[722.64 --> 724.22]  you did not watch the direct?
[724.86 --> 725.02]  No,
[725.02 --> 725.52]  I skimmed it.
[725.96 --> 726.36]  Oh,
[726.58 --> 727.84]  you missed a lot.
[729.28 --> 730.44]  I didn't know that was a thing.
[730.86 --> 731.26]  Yeah.
[733.32 --> 733.68]  So,
[734.28 --> 735.70]  and there's more.
[735.94 --> 736.60]  And 50 hours of game.
[736.64 --> 738.18]  And 50 hours of gameplay.
[740.84 --> 741.20]  Huh.
[741.88 --> 743.22]  They are prioritized,
[743.30 --> 744.32]  but not necessarily gated.
[744.44 --> 744.72]  Guys,
[745.18 --> 745.74]  basically,
[745.84 --> 746.80]  you know what that means,
[746.86 --> 747.08]  right?
[747.52 --> 748.20]  So is this pre-orders?
[748.20 --> 749.46]  Those are the guys who are going to get one.
[749.58 --> 750.94]  Is this pre-orders directly from Nintendo?
[751.76 --> 752.20]  Um,
[753.06 --> 755.50]  I believe that is directly from Nintendo.
[755.68 --> 756.44]  There's no way they're policing that through game stores.
[756.64 --> 756.84]  Yep.
[757.46 --> 757.70]  Yep.
[758.02 --> 758.98]  So this is,
[759.06 --> 762.64]  this is pretty flipping wild.
[762.92 --> 764.64]  So this is pre-orders on their website.
[764.64 --> 765.66]  So basically,
[766.68 --> 767.46]  because they're,
[767.66 --> 767.84]  okay,
[767.94 --> 768.12]  look,
[768.22 --> 772.52]  how is anybody else going to control scalpers from buying cartloads of these things?
[773.00 --> 773.22]  Like,
[773.28 --> 773.74]  we know,
[773.88 --> 774.26]  we've all,
[774.30 --> 777.38]  we've all seen the pictures from previous console launches,
[777.68 --> 779.00]  from GPU launches,
[779.14 --> 779.34]  right?
[779.34 --> 783.94]  We've seen the scalpers that have literally a palette of consoles in their living room,
[784.18 --> 784.44]  right?
[784.82 --> 789.28]  So anything that's going out into the channel through Best Buy or through other retailers
[789.28 --> 790.88]  is going to be scalped.
[791.28 --> 793.66]  So the ones that Nintendo is controlling,
[794.16 --> 795.26]  they're basically saying,
[795.34 --> 795.52]  look,
[795.52 --> 798.40]  you've got to have a Nintendo online subscription for 12 months.
[798.96 --> 802.72]  You've got to have 50 gameplay hours before the launch here.
[802.86 --> 804.52]  And I don't remember if there was any,
[804.78 --> 806.10]  if there was any other stuff.
[806.12 --> 806.26]  50 gameplay hours,
[806.34 --> 807.02]  like lifetime?
[807.46 --> 807.76]  I think,
[807.88 --> 808.02]  I,
[808.12 --> 810.48]  I'm not sure the time period for it.
[810.50 --> 811.22]  I think it's lifetime.
[811.42 --> 811.82]  Basically,
[812.04 --> 817.78]  the idea is that you are a Nintendo gamer and also that you give Nintendo money on an ongoing basis.
[817.78 --> 819.40]  I want to show one thing,
[819.80 --> 820.54]  final correction,
[820.66 --> 821.36]  because I did,
[821.58 --> 822.72]  it did sound like this,
[822.76 --> 824.04]  but I don't think this is what we said.
[826.84 --> 829.24]  Game chat is included with Nintendo switch online membership.
[829.40 --> 829.92]  Like we said,
[830.04 --> 832.72]  game chat open access period until March 31st,
[832.74 --> 833.28]  2026.
[833.38 --> 837.74]  But it says game chat can be used without a Nintendo switch online membership.
[838.74 --> 839.88]  During that time period.
[839.98 --> 840.38]  Yes.
[840.62 --> 841.06]  Afterwards,
[841.18 --> 843.64]  a Nintendo switch online membership will be required to use game chat.
[843.64 --> 844.28]  So yeah,
[844.36 --> 845.32]  you don't have to,
[845.76 --> 849.12]  which is really weird to me.
[849.50 --> 850.50]  So basically they,
[850.54 --> 850.62]  well,
[850.64 --> 851.64]  they want to get you hooked on,
[851.66 --> 854.84]  you can play single player games together in chat.
[856.16 --> 856.60]  Um,
[857.38 --> 857.88]  yeah,
[858.04 --> 858.78]  I guess,
[858.88 --> 859.36]  I guess.
[860.34 --> 860.78]  Yeah,
[860.88 --> 861.34]  I guess.
[861.44 --> 861.68]  Okay.
[861.76 --> 861.90]  Yeah,
[861.90 --> 862.12]  no.
[862.24 --> 862.38]  Yeah.
[862.42 --> 862.88]  Now I am.
[862.98 --> 863.92]  That's why I said it's,
[863.92 --> 866.52]  it's weird because you don't need Nintendo switch online,
[866.52 --> 868.48]  which is odd.
[868.86 --> 870.58]  So you can't play games together.
[870.58 --> 871.68]  As far as my understanding goes,
[871.82 --> 872.78]  there's game streaming.
[873.64 --> 874.54]  So it has a camera.
[874.90 --> 875.30]  Okay.
[875.34 --> 877.26]  So you could show someone you playing your game.
[877.34 --> 877.60]  Yes.
[877.74 --> 881.48]  So if you're on a trip and little man is playing a game.
[881.70 --> 881.96]  Yeah.
[882.06 --> 884.32]  You could like watch him play the game and talk to him.
[884.40 --> 885.06]  I guess,
[885.20 --> 885.70]  I guess,
[886.10 --> 886.56]  I guess.
[886.56 --> 889.96]  I can't imagine that I would do that for the four people that will do that.
[890.18 --> 890.80]  So anyway,
[890.92 --> 891.34]  anyway,
[891.66 --> 891.94]  I was,
[892.16 --> 893.72]  I'm glad we're finally getting to this.
[894.16 --> 895.24]  What is your thought?
[896.18 --> 900.00]  What is your thought on the fact that you cannot pre-order one,
[900.00 --> 906.42]  that you are not a verified actual gamer in Nintendo's eyes for not buying Nintendo online?
[907.06 --> 907.98]  I already,
[909.06 --> 909.86]  this is,
[909.86 --> 911.82]  this is going to sound like a hot take at first and then it's,
[911.90 --> 912.44]  it's not,
[912.56 --> 914.18]  but I already wasn't going to.
[915.26 --> 915.62]  Really?
[915.82 --> 916.40]  My reason.
[916.40 --> 916.70]  Okay.
[916.70 --> 917.12]  Hold on.
[917.18 --> 918.48]  We're going to get to that in a sec then.
[918.90 --> 919.56]  So let's,
[919.56 --> 920.28]  let's,
[920.36 --> 921.46]  let's finish going through.
[921.68 --> 921.80]  Okay.
[921.92 --> 922.10]  Sure.
[922.20 --> 922.52]  You know what?
[922.52 --> 923.60]  Way less of a hot take.
[923.70 --> 923.90]  Okay.
[924.14 --> 924.46]  All right.
[924.54 --> 924.90]  Hit me.
[925.98 --> 927.10]  Willow video games.
[927.74 --> 928.14]  Yes.
[928.36 --> 930.86]  Isn't getting an initial shipment as far as my understanding goes.
[931.32 --> 931.72]  Really?
[931.86 --> 932.14]  Nothing.
[932.36 --> 934.90]  They're not prioritized because they're a single store.
[935.66 --> 936.52]  And apparently.
[936.80 --> 937.18]  Okay.
[937.28 --> 938.72]  Who's getting prioritized at least in,
[938.78 --> 939.30]  in Canada,
[939.36 --> 940.32]  as far as my understanding goes,
[940.32 --> 942.72]  is the big places with multiple locations.
[942.98 --> 943.06]  Sure.
[943.18 --> 943.80]  So they like,
[944.06 --> 946.46]  they might get a first shipment,
[946.62 --> 947.50]  but as of right now,
[947.50 --> 949.30]  they are confident that they're getting games,
[949.44 --> 951.54]  but they are not confident that they're getting consoles.
[952.50 --> 953.38]  So they were like,
[953.64 --> 955.68]  they were all apologetic and they were like,
[955.76 --> 956.08]  Oh,
[956.20 --> 956.50]  like,
[957.06 --> 958.48]  sorry,
[958.58 --> 958.68]  I,
[958.76 --> 959.82]  you can go buy it somewhere else,
[959.82 --> 960.16]  I guess.
[960.18 --> 960.72]  And I was like,
[961.00 --> 961.28]  no.
[961.62 --> 961.92]  Yeah.
[962.18 --> 965.00]  Cause there's no way that you're buying a game console from somewhere other
[965.00 --> 965.70]  than Willow video.
[965.86 --> 966.06]  Yeah.
[966.42 --> 968.84]  So I'm just going to wait until they have them.
[968.84 --> 970.04]  And then I will buy one.
[970.14 --> 972.76]  Then I don't need it day one.
[973.10 --> 973.50]  Yep.
[973.58 --> 975.50]  I will support the store that I want to support.
[975.62 --> 979.26]  I will support the like mom and pop store that does cool stuff and has
[979.26 --> 980.18]  been doing cool stuff.
[980.18 --> 982.04]  Like the whole time I've been alive.
[982.16 --> 984.68]  I've been going to Willow since I was a small child.
[984.86 --> 988.20]  So I'm not going to just go throw my money somewhere else because I can get
[988.20 --> 989.52]  a console a couple of weeks earlier.
[989.64 --> 989.84]  See,
[989.96 --> 993.82]  I thought you were going to say that you are not going to buy a switch too.
[993.94 --> 996.92]  And that I would have been very surprised about,
[997.06 --> 1002.40]  even though I do think that there are a lot of good reasons not to buy a
[1002.40 --> 1002.92]  switch too.
[1003.54 --> 1005.38]  This one surprised me.
[1005.38 --> 1006.30]  There is a few.
[1006.40 --> 1006.54]  Yeah.
[1006.64 --> 1011.42]  The switch too is apparently going to be using something between a software
[1011.42 --> 1015.74]  emulator and hardware compatibility to play switch one games.
[1015.96 --> 1022.36]  There are currently 141 switch one games with known startup issues and 47 ones
[1022.36 --> 1025.02]  with in-game issues on the new handheld.
[1025.02 --> 1032.28]  There are also games that will likely never work as the Joy-Con 2 is a different shape
[1032.28 --> 1033.08]  than the original,
[1033.32 --> 1034.00]  like Ring Fit,
[1034.40 --> 1037.46]  and it doesn't include an IR motion camera.
[1037.84 --> 1038.74]  For example,
[1039.16 --> 1040.50]  WarioWare Move It.
[1040.76 --> 1044.48]  Could you do the new standalone camera that they're selling?
[1045.76 --> 1046.46]  For WarioWare?
[1046.66 --> 1053.94]  Ring Fit is probably screwed because the ring doesn't mount the controllers like the new one does.
[1053.94 --> 1058.56]  Ring Fit also looks like a mobile game from like the iPhone 3.
[1058.84 --> 1061.34]  So I don't think it really matters on that one.
[1061.62 --> 1061.74]  Yeah.
[1064.44 --> 1064.96]  Okay.
[1066.28 --> 1067.54]  Let's talk about the price.
[1070.16 --> 1071.58]  $450 US.
[1075.12 --> 1075.94]  It's a lot.
[1076.06 --> 1077.98]  It's interesting because if you look at,
[1078.30 --> 1079.52]  Atriok did this recently,
[1079.52 --> 1083.80]  but if you look at the game prices back to like Xbox 360 era,
[1084.18 --> 1084.22]  Yeah.
[1084.58 --> 1085.52]  The pricing,
[1085.78 --> 1086.72]  inflationary wise,
[1086.92 --> 1087.94]  as much as it sucks,
[1088.80 --> 1091.02]  is technically below inflation rate.
[1091.12 --> 1093.92]  It's kind of incredible that it's as low as it is.
[1094.06 --> 1094.70]  The console,
[1094.90 --> 1095.12]  however,
[1095.52 --> 1096.54]  is super not.
[1096.64 --> 1099.02]  The Switch 2 is notably more expensive than the Switch 1.
[1099.26 --> 1100.20]  Than the Switch 1,
[1100.30 --> 1100.68]  yes.
[1101.62 --> 1102.02]  But,
[1102.16 --> 1103.80]  Not necessarily consoles in general.
[1103.90 --> 1104.84]  I have a hot take.
[1105.12 --> 1105.32]  Yeah.
[1105.32 --> 1108.76]  I want to talk about Switch 2 pricing.
[1109.44 --> 1109.68]  Because,
[1110.06 --> 1111.14]  I think that,
[1111.16 --> 1111.62]  It's going to be scary.
[1112.00 --> 1112.40]  Millennials,
[1112.56 --> 1113.00]  It's going to be dangerous.
[1113.10 --> 1114.16]  And Gen Z's,
[1114.36 --> 1115.64]  You're going to have to put the hot take lights on.
[1115.76 --> 1117.04]  Are having a bit of a,
[1117.52 --> 1117.92]  Well,
[1118.02 --> 1119.12]  back in my day,
[1119.72 --> 1123.30]  games used to cost six brown eggs and a bale of hay.
[1124.18 --> 1124.58]  Moment.
[1124.68 --> 1125.02]  They did.
[1125.08 --> 1125.58]  Right now.
[1125.66 --> 1125.86]  It's true.
[1125.86 --> 1130.58]  When I was a kid,
[1132.10 --> 1132.30]  Okay?
[1133.24 --> 1135.68]  The Super Nintendo was $199.
[1137.80 --> 1143.68]  That is approximately $450 in today dollars.
[1143.84 --> 1143.86]  Yeah.
[1144.84 --> 1145.48]  Now,
[1145.64 --> 1147.28]  there is a big difference this time.
[1148.16 --> 1150.00]  For these younger generations,
[1150.66 --> 1153.14]  earnings haven't advanced on pace.
[1153.30 --> 1153.82]  They really have not.
[1153.82 --> 1155.86]  With that inflationary jump.
[1155.86 --> 1156.12]  At all.
[1156.24 --> 1156.56]  That,
[1156.56 --> 1160.40]  That basically makes the Switch 2 look perfectly reasonable.
[1160.66 --> 1161.44]  Compared to the Super Nintendo.
[1161.50 --> 1161.72]  I mean,
[1161.98 --> 1162.56]  The Ness.
[1163.20 --> 1164.56]  Back in the 1980s.
[1164.88 --> 1165.08]  What,
[1165.08 --> 1166.22]  What was the Ness?
[1166.28 --> 1167.66]  Was the Ness $200 as well?
[1167.76 --> 1168.52]  I believe so.
[1168.92 --> 1169.84]  Don't quote me on that,
[1169.90 --> 1170.94]  But I believe the Ness was $200.
[1171.02 --> 1176.36]  The Ness was flipping expensive in then dollars.
[1176.92 --> 1178.58]  $179 USD on launch.
[1179.48 --> 1179.76]  But,
[1180.08 --> 1180.26]  Honestly.
[1180.26 --> 1183.28]  Cost for inflation would be $523 USD.
[1183.28 --> 1183.46]  But,
[1183.46 --> 1183.82]  Honestly,
[1184.02 --> 1186.82]  I think the inflation argument is really tough.
[1186.96 --> 1187.34]  Because,
[1188.50 --> 1189.44]  You have to,
[1189.50 --> 1190.40]  You have to consider,
[1190.72 --> 1192.20]  Sort of the emotional side of it.
[1192.28 --> 1192.40]  Yeah,
[1192.40 --> 1193.50]  The inflation of what?
[1193.74 --> 1193.92]  Yeah,
[1194.00 --> 1194.94]  The inflation of what?
[1194.98 --> 1196.60]  Because when you talk about inflation,
[1197.16 --> 1197.30]  There,
[1197.42 --> 1198.82]  There's a whole bunch of different factors.
[1198.82 --> 1202.64]  And a lot of the things that get factored into the inflation calculation that we,
[1202.86 --> 1203.06]  You know,
[1203.10 --> 1204.36]  Get when we look online,
[1204.84 --> 1207.78]  Impact different people disproportionately.
[1207.78 --> 1208.66]  So,
[1208.66 --> 1216.50]  I think what's hurting so much is that this impacts the younger generation harder,
[1216.50 --> 1219.66]  Because it is a more significant part of,
[1219.96 --> 1219.98]  A,
[1220.04 --> 1220.60]  Their lifestyle,
[1220.94 --> 1221.42]  And B,
[1221.56 --> 1222.98]  Their discretionary spending.
[1222.98 --> 1227.32]  The lifestyle one is an interesting and probably accurate take.
[1227.54 --> 1227.90]  Because,
[1228.04 --> 1230.78]  As an older millennial at this point,
[1231.24 --> 1234.34]  I look at a console as a luxury item.
[1234.88 --> 1237.34]  I have never owned a PlayStation.
[1238.28 --> 1238.66]  Never.
[1239.26 --> 1240.02]  Even today,
[1240.30 --> 1242.18]  I do not own a PlayStation.
[1242.90 --> 1245.40]  I have never owned an Xbox.
[1246.24 --> 1247.40]  When I was a kid,
[1247.74 --> 1249.04]  My friend had a NES.
[1249.64 --> 1249.88]  Yeah.
[1250.04 --> 1250.48]  And then,
[1250.62 --> 1251.56]  I had a SNES.
[1252.10 --> 1252.28]  So,
[1252.36 --> 1253.40]  We'd go to his house to play.
[1253.90 --> 1254.14]  Then,
[1254.20 --> 1255.68]  We started going to my house to play.
[1256.08 --> 1258.88]  And he got an N64 for Christmas.
[1259.24 --> 1259.64]  So,
[1259.70 --> 1259.80]  Then,
[1259.84 --> 1260.96]  We'd go play at his house.
[1261.62 --> 1262.00]  Unless,
[1262.38 --> 1262.88]  You know,
[1263.00 --> 1263.46]  Realistically,
[1263.62 --> 1265.44]  We wanted to play one of,
[1265.60 --> 1266.78]  Something other than the like,
[1267.24 --> 1268.52]  Two game carts.
[1268.66 --> 1270.16]  That he had for the N64.
[1270.58 --> 1270.96]  And then,
[1271.00 --> 1271.56]  We'd go play,
[1271.66 --> 1271.88]  You know,
[1272.20 --> 1274.28]  Some of my older SNES games.
[1274.74 --> 1277.98]  I cried when my dad gave us an Xbox for Christmas.
[1278.20 --> 1278.36]  Dude,
[1278.46 --> 1279.56]  When I was a kid,
[1280.02 --> 1282.06]  Consoles were a luxury item.
[1282.06 --> 1282.36]  Oh, yeah.
[1282.44 --> 1284.70]  Not everyone had one in my class.
[1285.24 --> 1285.48]  You know,
[1285.56 --> 1286.38]  And no one,
[1286.84 --> 1288.90]  Not a single other kid I knew,
[1289.36 --> 1292.24]  Had two current gen consoles at the same time.
[1292.72 --> 1294.04]  And like a typical game library.
[1294.22 --> 1294.40]  For sure.
[1294.68 --> 1294.78]  Yeah.
[1294.92 --> 1296.18]  A typical game library,
[1296.44 --> 1296.96]  Was like,
[1297.38 --> 1298.02]  Five,
[1298.66 --> 1299.30]  Games,
[1299.42 --> 1300.22]  If you were like,
[1300.34 --> 1301.28]  Doing pretty good.
[1301.36 --> 1301.66]  Yeah,
[1301.74 --> 1302.58]  A lot of people had less.
[1302.64 --> 1303.44]  And if you had like,
[1303.54 --> 1304.20]  Ten games,
[1304.34 --> 1304.80]  It was like,
[1304.80 --> 1306.18]  You were ballin'.
[1306.18 --> 1306.76]  Whoa.
[1307.18 --> 1308.46]  It made me question like,
[1308.70 --> 1310.60]  What your parents did for work.
[1310.70 --> 1311.22]  But hold on,
[1311.30 --> 1312.28]  But here's another thing.
[1312.36 --> 1313.46]  Here's another thing that's different.
[1313.96 --> 1314.56]  Back then,
[1314.64 --> 1315.90]  We could go to the video store.
[1316.04 --> 1316.44]  And rent.
[1316.54 --> 1317.64]  And we could rent a game.
[1317.70 --> 1318.44]  And I do it all the time.
[1318.46 --> 1319.14]  For five bucks.
[1319.24 --> 1319.40]  Yeah.
[1319.90 --> 1320.16]  Right?
[1320.28 --> 1321.36]  And you could realistically,
[1321.80 --> 1322.00]  You know,
[1322.06 --> 1323.54]  Because so many of the games were,
[1324.02 --> 1324.80]  Let's be honest,
[1324.92 --> 1326.96]  Pretty two-dimensional experiences,
[1326.96 --> 1327.66]  Pun intended.
[1330.00 --> 1330.36]  Right?
[1330.84 --> 1330.92]  You,
[1331.16 --> 1331.50]  Oh,
[1331.60 --> 1332.42]  We have a ding!
[1332.52 --> 1333.80]  I didn't actually know.
[1334.12 --> 1334.56]  Let's go.
[1334.58 --> 1335.16]  Did you hear it?
[1335.22 --> 1335.56]  I wasn't sure.
[1335.56 --> 1335.76]  Yeah,
[1335.90 --> 1336.70]  I heard it.
[1336.74 --> 1337.10]  I heard it.
[1337.10 --> 1337.72]  I don't know if they did,
[1337.82 --> 1338.20]  But I heard it.
[1338.20 --> 1341.00]  You could actually enjoy that game,
[1341.34 --> 1342.50]  In a one-week rental,
[1342.92 --> 1343.02]  Yeah.
[1343.06 --> 1343.94]  For that five dollars.
[1343.94 --> 1344.30]  And that was,
[1344.46 --> 1344.72]  Honestly,
[1345.10 --> 1346.52]  This is a slightly off-topic thing,
[1346.64 --> 1347.40]  That was fun.
[1347.82 --> 1349.06]  It was kind of a challenge.
[1349.54 --> 1350.52]  Can I beat this game,
[1350.58 --> 1351.52]  Before I have to return it?
[1351.52 --> 1351.74]  Yeah,
[1351.94 --> 1352.32]  Absolutely.
[1352.48 --> 1353.18]  It was genuinely,
[1353.18 --> 1353.54]  Like,
[1353.58 --> 1354.06]  Kind of fun.
[1355.08 --> 1356.46]  I forgot about that.
[1356.50 --> 1357.30]  But I'm going to continue,
[1357.30 --> 1358.48]  Going back and forth,
[1359.00 --> 1360.56]  In my attempt to,
[1360.66 --> 1362.00]  Sort of present both sides,
[1362.00 --> 1362.42]  Of this,
[1362.62 --> 1363.06]  Of this,
[1363.16 --> 1363.78]  I was going to say,
[1364.10 --> 1365.58]  I was trying to say argument,
[1365.58 --> 1367.28]  But outrage almost came out of my mouth,
[1367.66 --> 1368.92]  Both of which are true,
[1368.98 --> 1369.54]  It is an argument,
[1369.68 --> 1370.40]  And it is outrageous,
[1371.04 --> 1372.80]  And let me,
[1372.84 --> 1373.48]  Let me kind of,
[1373.60 --> 1374.48]  Let me put it this way,
[1375.18 --> 1375.96]  Pound for pound,
[1377.38 --> 1378.48]  Is gaming not,
[1378.78 --> 1380.14]  Just about the cheapest,
[1380.30 --> 1381.12]  Form of entertainment,
[1381.36 --> 1381.62]  Oh yeah.
[1381.74 --> 1382.62]  On the face of the earth?
[1383.08 --> 1383.70]  So here's,
[1383.78 --> 1384.80]  Here's some numbers,
[1384.80 --> 1385.84]  That I ran before the show,
[1385.92 --> 1386.10]  Okay?
[1387.10 --> 1388.34]  If you bought a Switch,
[1388.70 --> 1389.98]  For three hundred dollars,
[1390.58 --> 1392.08]  And a library of ten,
[1392.32 --> 1393.38]  Sixty dollar games,
[1393.42 --> 1395.02]  I'd say that's a pretty generous library,
[1395.02 --> 1396.78]  If you used that,
[1397.04 --> 1397.66]  For even,
[1398.20 --> 1399.78]  One hour per week,
[1400.20 --> 1402.12]  For the eight years,
[1402.54 --> 1403.68]  That the Nintendo Switch,
[1403.90 --> 1405.64]  Was Nintendo's current console,
[1406.06 --> 1407.00]  It would have cost you,
[1407.12 --> 1408.32]  Just over two dollars an hour,
[1408.88 --> 1410.02]  Can you think of,
[1410.58 --> 1412.08]  Anything in your life,
[1412.46 --> 1413.74]  That you actually pay for,
[1414.10 --> 1415.80]  That is even close to that?
[1416.20 --> 1416.46]  No,
[1416.52 --> 1417.04]  And I bet you,
[1417.08 --> 1418.22]  You were honestly,
[1418.28 --> 1419.64]  Really conservative with that.
[1420.26 --> 1420.66]  Um,
[1421.18 --> 1421.68]  You know what?
[1422.06 --> 1422.98]  Reworksman says,
[1423.10 --> 1423.84]  Reading is cheaper,
[1423.84 --> 1425.54]  Especially with a library card,
[1425.62 --> 1426.26]  That's a good point,
[1426.56 --> 1426.74]  And,
[1426.78 --> 1427.18]  And that's,
[1427.26 --> 1427.78]  That's valid,
[1427.86 --> 1428.20]  What else?
[1428.20 --> 1428.28]  Okay,
[1428.42 --> 1429.62]  With a library card,
[1429.72 --> 1430.00]  Yes,
[1430.06 --> 1431.08]  If you're buying the books,
[1431.18 --> 1431.52]  Honestly,
[1431.62 --> 1432.60]  I don't think so.
[1432.64 --> 1432.76]  No,
[1432.80 --> 1433.48]  If you're buying books,
[1433.68 --> 1434.34]  Absolutely,
[1434.84 --> 1435.48]  Well,
[1436.14 --> 1436.76]  I don't think so.
[1436.78 --> 1437.14]  It depends,
[1437.22 --> 1437.36]  No,
[1437.40 --> 1437.48]  No,
[1437.48 --> 1438.00]  You can get,
[1438.04 --> 1439.02]  You can get decent deals,
[1439.52 --> 1439.86]  And,
[1439.98 --> 1440.96]  Depending on the speed,
[1441.00 --> 1441.68]  At which you read,
[1442.60 --> 1443.08]  No offense,
[1443.18 --> 1443.54]  For me,
[1443.60 --> 1444.12]  I suspect,
[1444.22 --> 1444.64]  You're getting,
[1444.94 --> 1446.08]  I suspect your,
[1446.08 --> 1447.68]  Cost per hour is pretty good.
[1448.00 --> 1448.24]  I've been,
[1448.26 --> 1449.34]  I've been dedicating really hard,
[1449.42 --> 1450.06]  I've been reading like,
[1450.10 --> 1450.76]  An hour a day,
[1450.82 --> 1451.96]  Every day for a while now,
[1453.84 --> 1455.28]  I'm getting a little faster,
[1455.40 --> 1456.22]  But I'm still slow.
[1456.38 --> 1456.62]  Okay,
[1456.70 --> 1456.98]  Give me,
[1457.08 --> 1457.90]  Give me something else.
[1458.26 --> 1459.50]  Give me something other than reading.
[1460.06 --> 1460.42]  Music,
[1460.64 --> 1460.98]  But like,
[1461.08 --> 1461.32]  Dang,
[1461.38 --> 1463.04]  I would never really want to do just that.
[1463.66 --> 1463.86]  Yeah.
[1464.60 --> 1464.78]  Yeah.
[1464.90 --> 1465.06]  So,
[1465.22 --> 1465.36]  Here,
[1465.44 --> 1465.58]  Oh,
[1465.62 --> 1466.40]  This is hilarious.
[1466.72 --> 1468.38]  Top Gear 1224 says,
[1468.46 --> 1470.02]  We're going to talk about Smash Champs pricing?
[1470.54 --> 1470.94]  Actually,
[1471.06 --> 1471.44]  We are.
[1471.64 --> 1471.90]  Yeah.
[1472.38 --> 1472.74]  Actually,
[1472.88 --> 1473.20]  We are.
[1473.30 --> 1473.42]  Here,
[1473.50 --> 1474.10]  Check this out.
[1474.36 --> 1474.80]  Check this out.
[1474.80 --> 1475.82]  And it's a good point.
[1475.92 --> 1476.42]  That is,
[1476.62 --> 1476.80]  Oh,
[1477.30 --> 1477.76]  Luke laptop,
[1477.92 --> 1478.10]  Whoops,
[1478.32 --> 1478.80]  Minus laptop.
[1478.80 --> 1479.30]  What are you doing?
[1479.36 --> 1479.66]  There you go.
[1480.28 --> 1481.76]  We are going to talk about that.
[1482.74 --> 1483.82]  At Smash Champs,
[1484.00 --> 1484.24]  Okay?
[1485.12 --> 1486.54]  That's our badminton center.
[1487.32 --> 1491.86]  I regularly watch people discard a $3 badminton shuttle.
[1491.94 --> 1494.78]  That's about what a single badminton shuttle costs.
[1494.88 --> 1496.04]  And that's not even a high-end one.
[1496.14 --> 1498.46]  They can go up to four plus Canadian dollars.
[1499.04 --> 1499.24]  Okay?
[1499.30 --> 1503.62]  I regularly watch people just throw it away because it isn't flying perfectly.
[1503.74 --> 1505.02]  So that they continue,
[1505.32 --> 1507.84]  So that they can continue their match that's costing them,
[1508.20 --> 1509.98]  Between the four people on court,
[1510.30 --> 1512.22]  About $8.50 an hour.
[1512.94 --> 1516.52]  Plus racket and shoes and other equipment costs,
[1516.62 --> 1517.84]  Plus their club membership fee,
[1517.96 --> 1519.20]  Plus gas money for travel.
[1519.90 --> 1520.88]  They don't question it.
[1521.36 --> 1523.62]  Because they see the work being put into it.
[1523.68 --> 1526.00]  They see the physical space being occupied.
[1526.00 --> 1530.64]  If we sub-switch two numbers into my math before,
[1530.78 --> 1531.02]  Okay?
[1531.32 --> 1533.86]  And if we assume a shorter lifespan for the console,
[1533.94 --> 1534.56]  Let's say it's only,
[1534.72 --> 1536.42]  Let's say we only get six years out of it.
[1536.78 --> 1540.46]  We end up with $4.32 per hour of entertainment.
[1541.46 --> 1541.52]  And again...
[1541.52 --> 1543.86]  Yeah, but you're still going off of one hour a week,
[1543.96 --> 1545.62]  Which I honestly think is really low.
[1545.74 --> 1546.06]  I know.
[1546.28 --> 1546.48]  Yeah.
[1546.58 --> 1546.98]  I know.
[1547.38 --> 1548.20]  That assumes...
[1548.20 --> 1549.96]  Like low enough to throw it all off.
[1550.30 --> 1550.58]  That...
[1550.58 --> 1551.06]  Well, yeah.
[1551.14 --> 1552.32]  But my point is that,
[1552.50 --> 1554.32]  Even if we say,
[1554.62 --> 1555.22]  Well, Linus,
[1555.22 --> 1556.58]  Your math is suspect,
[1557.10 --> 1558.38]  I feel like by saying,
[1558.52 --> 1561.72]  You will use your Switch just one hour per week,
[1561.96 --> 1562.16]  Yeah.
[1563.26 --> 1566.46]  I can pretty much defend against that.
[1566.50 --> 1569.46]  Because if you're not going to use your Switch an hour per week,
[1570.20 --> 1572.20]  Why do you even care about any of this?
[1572.86 --> 1573.74]  Don't buy one.
[1574.72 --> 1576.96]  Like that just seems pretty obvious to me.
[1576.96 --> 1578.78]  Or, remember guys,
[1579.16 --> 1580.38]  There's always another way.
[1580.38 --> 1582.38]  Okay, this was a really...
[1583.12 --> 1583.36]  Yeah.
[1583.84 --> 1585.02]  This was a really,
[1585.16 --> 1585.66]  I don't know,
[1585.78 --> 1587.50]  Interesting conversation for me.
[1588.16 --> 1589.82]  Frustrating conversation to me.
[1589.94 --> 1592.84]  I don't know how to describe the mixed emotions that I had.
[1593.76 --> 1597.22]  And I'm about to say something that will probably cost me some money.
[1597.40 --> 1597.60]  Alright?
[1598.48 --> 1600.84]  There was a thread on the forum recently,
[1601.26 --> 1605.08]  Asking why the heck it is that Floatplane doesn't have regional pricing.
[1605.82 --> 1606.04]  Okay?
[1606.04 --> 1611.76]  Why we're asking a ludicrous sum of five US dollars per month
[1611.76 --> 1613.64]  For people who live somewhere
[1613.64 --> 1617.98]  Where that is a significant portion of their disposable income.
[1618.26 --> 1618.42]  Okay?
[1618.70 --> 1620.98]  What little disposable income they have.
[1621.76 --> 1622.60]  And I basically,
[1622.80 --> 1625.94]  I could have given them a long technical explanation
[1625.94 --> 1626.96]  About, you know,
[1627.32 --> 1628.90]  VPNs and gray market
[1628.90 --> 1632.50]  And the realities that our business
[1632.50 --> 1634.48]  Runs on, you know,
[1634.68 --> 1636.10]  Western monies
[1636.10 --> 1637.68]  Not, you know,
[1637.78 --> 1638.74]  Rubles or whatever.
[1639.08 --> 1640.06]  And so, like,
[1640.14 --> 1642.14]  It wouldn't even help our costs.
[1642.22 --> 1643.98]  Like, our costs are in Western monies.
[1644.10 --> 1645.92]  And we don't operate at the kind of scale
[1645.92 --> 1647.48]  Of someone like YouTube or Netflix.
[1648.40 --> 1651.14]  I could have done a whole thing about that.
[1651.72 --> 1653.68]  But instead, what I said was,
[1654.22 --> 1657.02]  Why don't you subscribe to Floatplane for one month?
[1657.84 --> 1659.68]  Download every video you want to watch.
[1659.68 --> 1661.82]  And then unsubscribe.
[1662.68 --> 1664.06]  And then do it again next year.
[1667.04 --> 1667.60]  People...
[1667.60 --> 1668.82]  We don't stop you from doing that.
[1668.94 --> 1670.04]  People gotta...
[1670.04 --> 1672.36]  People gotta get more creative.
[1672.54 --> 1673.68]  It's like...
[1674.58 --> 1674.86]  Like,
[1674.94 --> 1676.76]  I don't understand
[1676.76 --> 1680.10]  Why people are not thinking
[1680.10 --> 1681.68]  About...
[1682.12 --> 1683.50]  Like, if you can't...
[1683.50 --> 1684.96]  If something is not affordable, okay?
[1684.96 --> 1686.98]  If you told kid me,
[1687.46 --> 1687.72]  Okay?
[1687.84 --> 1689.14]  I'm 14.
[1689.38 --> 1689.94]  I'm 15.
[1690.36 --> 1690.60]  Okay?
[1690.78 --> 1692.08]  You told kid me,
[1692.70 --> 1692.90]  Hey,
[1693.36 --> 1694.26]  This new console
[1694.26 --> 1695.78]  Is $450.
[1698.20 --> 1699.02]  I'm gonna go,
[1699.14 --> 1699.38]  Okay.
[1699.98 --> 1701.56]  What are the games I want to play?
[1702.22 --> 1702.84]  And I'm gonna go,
[1703.12 --> 1703.42]  Alright.
[1704.46 --> 1705.90]  Can I still buy used games?
[1706.42 --> 1706.76]  Okay.
[1707.32 --> 1708.94]  I'm gonna wait for...
[1708.94 --> 1710.08]  Usually it takes, like,
[1710.28 --> 1711.14]  A week or two.
[1711.40 --> 1712.82]  Because people will run out...
[1712.82 --> 1714.46]  People with more money than cents
[1714.46 --> 1715.60]  Will run out and buy a game
[1715.60 --> 1717.18]  Not having read a single review
[1717.18 --> 1719.22]  Not having watched any gameplay footage
[1719.22 --> 1720.10]  Play it, not like it.
[1720.10 --> 1721.02]  Play it, not like it
[1721.02 --> 1722.26]  And they'll take it back to GameStop.
[1722.38 --> 1722.56]  Alright?
[1723.18 --> 1723.96]  That's their problem.
[1724.26 --> 1725.08]  That's not your problem.
[1725.68 --> 1726.40]  That's your benefit.
[1726.62 --> 1726.82]  Yeah.
[1727.12 --> 1728.56]  So, you wait a little bit.
[1729.08 --> 1730.60]  You pick up a console used
[1730.60 --> 1731.64]  From someone who bought it
[1731.64 --> 1732.50]  And realized,
[1732.82 --> 1734.40]  Oh, actually I don't use this that much.
[1734.58 --> 1735.58]  You wait a little bit.
[1736.22 --> 1738.20]  When you buy something second hand,
[1738.78 --> 1741.16]  The worst of the depreciation curve,
[1741.16 --> 1742.54]  That comes off
[1742.54 --> 1744.52]  From the first owner.
[1745.20 --> 1745.80]  So you basically,
[1745.92 --> 1746.86]  You buy that console,
[1747.28 --> 1748.76]  You play those couple of games,
[1749.12 --> 1749.94]  You flip them.
[1750.78 --> 1752.30]  It didn't happen for free.
[1752.88 --> 1753.16]  Okay?
[1753.26 --> 1755.14]  You had to actually shell out that money.
[1755.40 --> 1756.58]  You had that cash tied up.
[1756.62 --> 1757.72]  It affects your cash flow.
[1758.10 --> 1759.28]  And you might not get back
[1759.28 --> 1760.36]  Exactly what you paid.
[1760.70 --> 1761.62]  But it's a Nintendo.
[1762.40 --> 1763.66]  You know for a fact
[1763.66 --> 1765.38]  That there isn't gonna be a new one
[1765.38 --> 1766.82]  Six months from now.
[1766.82 --> 1768.10]  So if you were to,
[1768.28 --> 1770.00]  If you were to buy one second hand
[1770.00 --> 1771.08]  For, you know,
[1771.14 --> 1772.22]  Two months in,
[1773.24 --> 1775.14]  You know for a fact
[1775.14 --> 1776.78]  That you could hold on to it
[1776.78 --> 1777.58]  For a few months,
[1777.82 --> 1779.48]  Play the games you wanna play,
[1779.74 --> 1781.18]  And it'll probably cost you
[1781.18 --> 1781.60]  Total,
[1781.90 --> 1782.68]  Somewhere in the neighborhood
[1782.68 --> 1784.56]  Of like 50 to 75 bucks
[1784.56 --> 1785.96]  In depreciation
[1785.96 --> 1787.56]  On those purchases.
[1789.64 --> 1790.82]  Get creative.
[1791.82 --> 1791.98]  Yeah.
[1791.98 --> 1796.22]  I don't have much to add.
[1796.36 --> 1796.90]  Just, yeah.
[1798.46 --> 1799.12]  Like I
[1799.12 --> 1800.96]  You can also even like
[1800.96 --> 1802.22]  If you wait a little bit longer,
[1802.22 --> 1803.24]  You can wait till there's like
[1803.24 --> 1804.60]  Cool models on the used market.
[1804.74 --> 1805.64]  Somebody mentioned like,
[1805.72 --> 1807.40]  Oh, but GameStop isn't gonna exist.
[1807.42 --> 1808.74]  It's like, okay, cool.
[1809.08 --> 1809.74]  Cut out the middleman.
[1809.82 --> 1810.46]  Go to Facebook Marketplace.
[1810.48 --> 1811.52]  Go to Facebook Marketplace.
[1811.54 --> 1811.72]  Yeah.
[1812.14 --> 1813.34]  That's not a stopper.
[1813.56 --> 1814.38]  And I know that,
[1814.48 --> 1815.06]  I know that,
[1815.10 --> 1815.26]  You know,
[1815.30 --> 1816.70]  Not everyone has a super active
[1816.70 --> 1817.70]  Facebook Marketplace
[1817.70 --> 1818.36]  In their region
[1818.36 --> 1819.42]  Or whatever else.
[1819.50 --> 1820.74]  But where there is
[1820.74 --> 1821.86]  Something being bought
[1821.86 --> 1823.06]  And something being sold,
[1823.44 --> 1824.62]  There will be a platform.
[1827.06 --> 1827.50]  KG4WWN,
[1827.58 --> 1828.38]  I think that's your name,
[1828.62 --> 1828.88]  Said,
[1828.98 --> 1829.92]  That's a decent way to do it,
[1829.94 --> 1830.50]  But if everyone did it,
[1830.52 --> 1831.16]  The system would fail.
[1832.06 --> 1832.78]  Fun fact,
[1833.08 --> 1833.82]  Guaranteed,
[1833.90 --> 1834.78]  Not everyone will do it.
[1834.86 --> 1835.10]  Yes.
[1835.80 --> 1836.72]  Because not everyone
[1836.72 --> 1837.76]  Is as smart as you.
[1838.48 --> 1839.74]  Or not everyone cares
[1839.74 --> 1840.50]  As much as you.
[1841.06 --> 1841.24]  Like,
[1841.34 --> 1842.10]  I remember,
[1842.48 --> 1842.90]  I remember,
[1843.02 --> 1844.10]  I'm not gonna name names
[1844.10 --> 1844.64]  On this one,
[1844.92 --> 1845.76]  But I remember having
[1845.76 --> 1846.50]  This conversation
[1846.50 --> 1847.86]  With a relative of mine
[1847.86 --> 1848.42]  Who,
[1848.42 --> 1850.76]  Who I grew up with,
[1850.96 --> 1851.82]  We grew up,
[1852.30 --> 1854.00]  Not like,
[1854.64 --> 1855.52]  Desperately poor,
[1855.94 --> 1857.18]  But we grew up with,
[1857.26 --> 1857.52]  Like,
[1858.38 --> 1859.16]  Cutting coupons,
[1859.70 --> 1861.02]  Washing eggs,
[1861.40 --> 1862.34]  In our spare time,
[1862.46 --> 1862.96]  And running like,
[1862.98 --> 1863.46]  A family,
[1863.94 --> 1864.16]  Like,
[1864.20 --> 1865.12]  Egg business on our
[1865.12 --> 1865.78]  Hobby farm,
[1865.94 --> 1866.06]  Like,
[1866.20 --> 1867.92]  Being pretty scrappy.
[1868.12 --> 1868.68]  I think there's a lot
[1868.68 --> 1869.26]  Of benefit to that.
[1869.26 --> 1870.26]  By the end of the summer,
[1870.48 --> 1871.00]  We were,
[1871.48 --> 1873.06]  My parents are both teachers,
[1873.16 --> 1873.34]  Okay?
[1873.42 --> 1874.40]  So by the end of the summer,
[1874.56 --> 1875.90]  We're trying to figure out,
[1875.98 --> 1876.30]  Like,
[1877.00 --> 1877.46]  Okay,
[1877.78 --> 1878.26]  Um,
[1878.44 --> 1879.98]  Do we really need to,
[1880.06 --> 1881.54]  How to combine as many errands
[1881.54 --> 1882.08]  As possible
[1882.08 --> 1883.64]  Into one car trip to town
[1883.64 --> 1884.90]  So that we don't have to
[1884.90 --> 1885.62]  Fill the gas tank.
[1885.70 --> 1885.78]  Like,
[1885.82 --> 1886.46]  We're out of money,
[1886.76 --> 1887.04]  Okay?
[1887.48 --> 1887.92]  At the,
[1887.94 --> 1888.74]  At the end of August,
[1888.84 --> 1889.62]  Beginning of September.
[1889.82 --> 1889.94]  So,
[1890.00 --> 1890.42]  So that's,
[1890.48 --> 1890.94]  That was my,
[1891.02 --> 1891.96]  That was my situation.
[1892.78 --> 1893.18]  And,
[1894.40 --> 1894.86]  Um,
[1894.98 --> 1895.16]  Shoot,
[1895.28 --> 1896.56]  What did you say just before this?
[1896.78 --> 1897.26]  I forget.
[1898.72 --> 1899.08]  Uh,
[1900.08 --> 1900.44]  Right,
[1900.48 --> 1900.58]  Right,
[1900.58 --> 1900.72]  Right,
[1900.72 --> 1900.86]  Right,
[1900.86 --> 1901.00]  Right,
[1901.00 --> 1901.04]  Right,
[1901.10 --> 1901.98]  A relative of mine.
[1901.98 --> 1903.82]  I remember having a conversation
[1903.82 --> 1905.02]  With a relative of mine
[1905.02 --> 1905.66]  Who was,
[1906.24 --> 1906.60]  Um,
[1907.46 --> 1907.76]  Like,
[1908.40 --> 1911.32]  Aggressively haggling
[1911.32 --> 1912.46]  At like a,
[1912.46 --> 1913.76]  A liquidation place
[1913.76 --> 1914.94]  Or like a second hand,
[1915.10 --> 1916.12]  Like a value village
[1916.12 --> 1916.96]  Type of place.
[1917.06 --> 1917.98]  Like they were trying to like
[1917.98 --> 1919.74]  Get a deal on something
[1919.74 --> 1920.56]  And I kind of went,
[1921.24 --> 1924.48]  I'll never be too good
[1924.48 --> 1925.64]  To shop at a dollar store.
[1926.06 --> 1926.32]  Alright?
[1926.78 --> 1927.10]  Like,
[1927.42 --> 1927.74]  Never.
[1928.18 --> 1928.32]  Yeah,
[1928.36 --> 1928.76]  100%.
[1928.76 --> 1929.54]  But,
[1929.54 --> 1932.02]  Does someone else
[1932.02 --> 1933.16]  Maybe need that,
[1933.72 --> 1935.44]  That marked down
[1935.44 --> 1935.96]  Merchandise
[1935.96 --> 1936.98]  A little more than us?
[1938.20 --> 1938.60]  Like,
[1938.64 --> 1939.36]  Do we need to,
[1939.42 --> 1940.38]  Do we need to grind
[1940.38 --> 1941.32]  Them so hard?
[1942.18 --> 1942.46]  Right?
[1942.98 --> 1943.24]  Yeah.
[1943.72 --> 1944.24]  Um,
[1944.30 --> 1944.98]  I feel this way,
[1945.06 --> 1945.54]  Oh man,
[1945.72 --> 1946.40]  This is a hot take.
[1946.44 --> 1946.58]  So,
[1946.58 --> 1946.90]  So,
[1946.90 --> 1947.44]  So,
[1947.44 --> 1948.42]  So I'll tell you guys,
[1948.66 --> 1949.54]  I'm just gonna,
[1949.66 --> 1950.56]  I'm gonna buy a Switch 2.
[1951.32 --> 1952.04]  I'm not gonna pay
[1952.04 --> 1952.66]  Scalper prices,
[1952.72 --> 1953.36]  I won't do that,
[1953.46 --> 1953.70]  Because,
[1953.84 --> 1954.08]  Again,
[1954.28 --> 1955.08]  That's just on principle.
[1955.80 --> 1956.46]  But I'm just gonna,
[1956.54 --> 1957.72]  I'm gonna wait till it's in stock,
[1957.86 --> 1958.38]  In a store,
[1958.38 --> 1959.24]  And I'm gonna walk in,
[1959.26 --> 1959.94]  And I'm gonna buy it.
[1960.40 --> 1960.80]  And,
[1960.92 --> 1961.52]  I'm not gonna,
[1961.62 --> 1963.14]  I'm not gonna worry about that.
[1963.42 --> 1964.24]  And if,
[1964.60 --> 1964.92]  You know,
[1965.04 --> 1966.50]  If my impulse purchase,
[1966.62 --> 1967.40]  That I can afford,
[1967.86 --> 1969.04]  Benefits someone else later,
[1969.24 --> 1969.78]  Then great.
[1970.00 --> 1971.18]  Someone at our Christmas party,
[1971.26 --> 1972.42]  Got my launch Switch.
[1972.94 --> 1973.24]  Because,
[1973.50 --> 1974.42]  I didn't need it anymore,
[1974.54 --> 1975.30]  Because I bought an OLED,
[1975.64 --> 1976.58]  And I'm a big idiot,
[1976.84 --> 1977.62]  And I didn't consider,
[1977.78 --> 1978.66]  That I had a launch Switch,
[1978.70 --> 1979.30]  That was moddable.
[1981.22 --> 1981.58]  Realistically,
[1981.74 --> 1983.28]  I buy all my Nintendo games now anyway,
[1983.42 --> 1983.62]  So,
[1983.72 --> 1984.70]  It didn't really matter,
[1984.82 --> 1985.00]  But,
[1985.28 --> 1985.56]  Still.
[1985.70 --> 1985.86]  But,
[1985.86 --> 1986.10]  But,
[1986.10 --> 1986.68]  But still,
[1986.80 --> 1986.98]  You know,
[1987.02 --> 1988.30]  Now somebody has a moddable one.
[1988.30 --> 1988.54]  Dang it,
[1988.56 --> 1989.40]  I had a moddable one,
[1989.48 --> 1991.12]  But now someone else has a moddable one.
[1992.06 --> 1992.74]  And so,
[1992.94 --> 1993.22]  No,
[1993.36 --> 1995.22]  Not everyone is going to,
[1995.78 --> 1997.72]  Not everyone is going to use these strategies.
[1998.12 --> 1998.92]  With that said,
[1999.36 --> 2000.86]  That's a really good point,
[2001.18 --> 2001.84]  That if,
[2001.84 --> 2005.12]  If a growing number,
[2005.20 --> 2007.16]  If a disproportionate number of people do,
[2007.38 --> 2008.32]  Use these strategies,
[2008.32 --> 2010.16]  It actually does have an impact,
[2010.16 --> 2011.16]  On the second hand market,
[2011.30 --> 2012.40]  And look no further,
[2012.52 --> 2014.12]  Than what happened to the auto market,
[2014.74 --> 2015.36]  During COVID,
[2016.16 --> 2017.34]  Where used vehicles,
[2017.80 --> 2019.00]  Suddenly cost more,
[2019.24 --> 2020.28]  Than a new vehicle.
[2020.98 --> 2021.32]  Like that,
[2021.48 --> 2022.34]  What was that?
[2023.20 --> 2023.52]  Also,
[2023.62 --> 2023.90]  Brace,
[2023.96 --> 2025.04]  That could be happening again,
[2025.22 --> 2026.82]  We're going to have a tariff conversation,
[2026.94 --> 2027.58]  A little bit later,
[2027.58 --> 2028.08]  That's the,
[2028.08 --> 2028.24]  Yeah,
[2028.24 --> 2030.14]  That's the other part of the title of the show,
[2030.20 --> 2031.06]  We'll talk about that later,
[2031.06 --> 2031.20]  But,
[2031.26 --> 2032.64]  People are also mentioning this,
[2032.68 --> 2033.60]  In relation to the switch,
[2033.62 --> 2033.98]  Because,
[2034.30 --> 2035.36]  It was announced at whatever,
[2035.50 --> 2035.90]  450,
[2036.34 --> 2037.50]  Or I think it was 499,
[2037.70 --> 2037.92]  With,
[2037.92 --> 2038.38]  With,
[2038.44 --> 2039.78]  Mario Kart World,
[2039.96 --> 2040.08]  Yeah,
[2040.08 --> 2041.64]  But people are pointing out,
[2041.84 --> 2042.98]  That Nintendo has already,
[2042.98 --> 2043.90]  Put out an announcement,
[2044.06 --> 2044.58]  Saying that,
[2044.90 --> 2046.70]  I think they're not doing pre-orders,
[2046.82 --> 2047.24]  In the US,
[2047.48 --> 2047.90]  Well their,
[2047.90 --> 2049.46]  Their pre-order date,
[2049.54 --> 2050.18]  Is delayed,
[2050.48 --> 2050.80]  Got it,
[2050.84 --> 2052.42]  The launch date is not delayed,
[2052.60 --> 2052.72]  Yeah,
[2052.72 --> 2054.54]  But the pre-order date is delayed,
[2054.72 --> 2055.64]  And they were explicit,
[2056.32 --> 2058.12]  That this is because of,
[2058.40 --> 2058.76]  Of course it is,
[2058.76 --> 2059.78]  Their need to evaluate,
[2059.98 --> 2061.24]  The situation around,
[2061.56 --> 2062.00]  The tariffs,
[2062.08 --> 2063.06]  And I'm not recommending,
[2063.30 --> 2063.86]  You do this,
[2063.96 --> 2064.82]  But Canada,
[2065.16 --> 2066.52]  Isn't going to have tariffs on them,
[2067.44 --> 2068.72]  So it should probably,
[2068.72 --> 2069.94]  Still be about that price up here,
[2070.74 --> 2072.26]  And I think if something was used,
[2073.04 --> 2074.92]  You could bring it back over the board,
[2074.96 --> 2075.84]  It wouldn't be tariffed,
[2076.52 --> 2077.40]  Oh yeah,
[2078.18 --> 2079.64]  Right,
[2079.78 --> 2080.16]  Like if,
[2080.30 --> 2081.60]  Like if say for example,
[2081.84 --> 2083.08]  All of the packaging,
[2083.40 --> 2084.06]  Do it your own risk,
[2084.08 --> 2085.56]  Found its way into the,
[2085.56 --> 2087.58]  The dumpster behind the,
[2087.98 --> 2088.18]  Yeah,
[2088.28 --> 2089.74]  Willow video where you bought it,
[2089.82 --> 2090.48]  Had some save,
[2090.54 --> 2090.72]  Yeah,
[2090.82 --> 2092.34]  Maybe if you had some save games,
[2092.34 --> 2093.38]  On it already or something,
[2093.48 --> 2093.60]  Yeah,
[2093.62 --> 2095.00]  So you could prove that you've used it before,
[2095.14 --> 2095.22]  Yeah,
[2095.26 --> 2095.44]  Yeah,
[2096.04 --> 2096.30]  Yeah,
[2096.70 --> 2097.82]  I mean it's pretty new anyway,
[2097.98 --> 2098.54]  Like you know,
[2098.54 --> 2100.36]  You would have had to get it like,
[2100.42 --> 2102.26]  Somewhere kind of in the last little while window,
[2102.34 --> 2103.42]  It would look pretty new regardless,
[2103.54 --> 2103.72]  Right?
[2103.88 --> 2104.10]  Yeah,
[2104.14 --> 2104.46]  I don't know,
[2104.52 --> 2104.82]  I mean,
[2105.12 --> 2105.94]  We would never,
[2106.50 --> 2107.24]  We would never,
[2108.52 --> 2109.32]  Living says,
[2109.38 --> 2111.08]  All strategies are valid until you get audited,
[2111.12 --> 2111.76]  What do you mean audited?
[2111.76 --> 2112.68]  No one audits,
[2112.68 --> 2113.84]  No one audits,
[2113.84 --> 2114.80]  No one audits things you bought,
[2115.08 --> 2115.38]  That's,
[2115.68 --> 2116.46]  Cause it's,
[2116.60 --> 2117.72]  There's no taxation,
[2118.26 --> 2119.72]  We're not really suggesting anything,
[2119.86 --> 2120.30]  We're just saying,
[2120.42 --> 2121.14]  It's probably going to be,
[2121.62 --> 2122.70]  Not as bad for,
[2122.78 --> 2123.66]  I mean it's still expensive,
[2123.76 --> 2124.90]  But it's not as bad for Canadians,
[2125.02 --> 2125.18]  You know?
[2125.56 --> 2126.42]  Electro Bot says,
[2126.84 --> 2127.48]  IARC,
[2127.54 --> 2128.82]  You do have to report that,
[2128.90 --> 2129.30]  Technically,
[2129.58 --> 2129.92]  Legally,
[2130.10 --> 2130.82]  Of course you do,
[2131.10 --> 2131.52]  Yes,
[2131.78 --> 2133.08]  Make sure you do that,
[2133.26 --> 2133.40]  No,
[2133.48 --> 2134.94]  This is not only not legal advice,
[2135.04 --> 2136.40]  This is not advice at all,
[2136.60 --> 2136.84]  Yeah,
[2137.26 --> 2138.14]  It's not advice,
[2138.14 --> 2138.74]  Yeah,
[2138.80 --> 2139.74]  All we're doing is,
[2140.22 --> 2141.72]  Pointing out that Canada's not tariffing them,
[2142.22 --> 2142.34]  We,
[2142.50 --> 2143.34]  That is true,
[2143.60 --> 2143.76]  Yeah,
[2143.92 --> 2144.42]  That is true,
[2144.54 --> 2144.66]  And,
[2144.72 --> 2144.98]  And,
[2145.06 --> 2146.50]  And if you didn't happen to live,
[2146.54 --> 2147.66]  Anywhere near the northern border,
[2148.06 --> 2148.42]  Um,
[2148.80 --> 2149.04]  Uh,
[2149.40 --> 2149.84]  I don't,
[2150.14 --> 2151.00]  I doubt that Mexico,
[2151.48 --> 2152.48]  Has any tariffs on,
[2152.50 --> 2153.08]  Probably not,
[2153.12 --> 2153.96]  The Switch 2 either,
[2154.40 --> 2155.08]  I,
[2155.14 --> 2156.18]  I have no idea,
[2156.18 --> 2156.52]  What,
[2156.66 --> 2156.98]  Like,
[2157.30 --> 2158.72]  Mexican Best Buy is,
[2159.06 --> 2159.16]  Yeah,
[2159.24 --> 2159.36]  But,
[2159.46 --> 2161.12]  They might have something like that,
[2161.20 --> 2162.76]  That would have a Nintendo Switch,
[2163.46 --> 2163.98]  So that's,
[2164.04 --> 2164.44]  Something,
[2164.98 --> 2165.90]  That is a thing,
[2166.06 --> 2166.90]  That is something,
[2167.34 --> 2167.64]  Anyway,
[2168.14 --> 2168.86]  Um,
[2169.46 --> 2172.10]  Game upgrades,
[2172.66 --> 2173.34]  Should we talk about that?
[2173.46 --> 2174.86]  Let's talk about game upgrades,
[2175.04 --> 2175.20]  Uh,
[2175.20 --> 2176.48]  This is another thing that,
[2176.62 --> 2177.04]  Um,
[2178.56 --> 2179.12]  Ah,
[2179.64 --> 2180.10]  Man,
[2180.20 --> 2181.14]  I'm bummed about,
[2181.30 --> 2181.62]  So,
[2181.86 --> 2182.70]  We talked about the,
[2182.78 --> 2183.96]  Sort of the emulator element,
[2184.10 --> 2184.22]  See,
[2184.30 --> 2184.54]  I,
[2184.54 --> 2186.04]  I assumed,
[2186.22 --> 2188.42]  And maybe this is just me being naive,
[2189.02 --> 2191.76]  Because I'm sure the software is so different,
[2192.44 --> 2192.82]  Um,
[2193.20 --> 2194.08]  And by software,
[2194.20 --> 2196.84]  I don't even just mean like the home screen looks different,
[2196.92 --> 2197.06]  You know,
[2197.06 --> 2197.68]  I mean like the,
[2197.74 --> 2198.68]  The driver level,
[2198.98 --> 2200.34]  Operation of this console,
[2200.42 --> 2201.30]  Is going to be so different,
[2201.38 --> 2201.74]  I'm sure,
[2202.22 --> 2203.72]  That the software development,
[2204.06 --> 2205.58]  Kit is completely different,
[2205.68 --> 2205.96]  I'm sure,
[2206.02 --> 2207.72]  All the developer tools are completely different,
[2208.12 --> 2209.56]  But I had kind of hoped,
[2209.66 --> 2210.68]  That because it was,
[2210.96 --> 2211.70]  Arm CPU,
[2211.70 --> 2213.38]  NVIDIA GPU,
[2213.58 --> 2214.24]  It would just direct,
[2214.36 --> 2216.60]  That you would basically just put your Switch 1 game in it,
[2216.66 --> 2217.74]  And it would run at higher FPS,
[2218.06 --> 2218.32]  That's,
[2218.42 --> 2220.16]  When I was skimming through the direct,
[2220.30 --> 2221.36]  I thought that's what they meant,
[2221.86 --> 2222.64]  Was it would just work,
[2223.40 --> 2223.80]  So,
[2224.06 --> 2224.70]  Unfortunately,
[2225.16 --> 2227.52]  That does not appear to be,
[2227.52 --> 2229.52]  The way that things are going,
[2231.10 --> 2231.54]  Instead,
[2231.80 --> 2232.62]  It looks like,
[2232.70 --> 2233.66]  It'll be a mix,
[2233.66 --> 2234.96]  Some of them,
[2235.08 --> 2236.14]  Are going to,
[2236.14 --> 2237.72]  Just kind of work,
[2238.12 --> 2238.92]  In the Switch 2,
[2239.00 --> 2240.22]  With minor changes,
[2240.94 --> 2241.32]  Um,
[2241.68 --> 2243.46]  The only one that I really cared about,
[2244.12 --> 2244.94]  The only game,
[2245.14 --> 2246.54]  Where I ever really felt like,
[2246.60 --> 2248.34]  The Switch's underpowered hardware,
[2248.60 --> 2249.82]  Dramatically impacted,
[2249.82 --> 2250.94]  My gameplay experience,
[2251.12 --> 2251.96]  Was Breath of the Wild,
[2252.46 --> 2253.60]  Yes,
[2253.60 --> 2254.90]  I wanted Breath of the Wild,
[2255.04 --> 2255.18]  Yeah,
[2255.40 --> 2256.02]  At like,
[2256.58 --> 2257.86]  At least,
[2258.40 --> 2259.52]  Rock solid 60,
[2259.90 --> 2260.70]  And once I found out,
[2260.76 --> 2261.88]  About the 120 hertz display,
[2262.38 --> 2263.62]  What I realistically wanted,
[2263.74 --> 2265.36]  Was between 60 and 120,
[2265.52 --> 2266.56]  With variable refresh rate,
[2266.98 --> 2267.74]  And I think,
[2267.92 --> 2268.98]  There was a massive,
[2269.28 --> 2270.38]  Massive boom,
[2270.64 --> 2271.26]  In emulating,
[2271.44 --> 2272.40]  Right around Breath of the Wild,
[2272.48 --> 2273.52]  Because I don't think you were alone,
[2273.78 --> 2275.12]  A lot of people had issues,
[2275.12 --> 2276.24]  With the performance of that game,
[2276.48 --> 2277.36]  And a lot of people,
[2277.54 --> 2278.76]  Sought out other solutions,
[2278.76 --> 2281.76]  I still don't fully know,
[2281.88 --> 2283.36]  Exactly what the situation is,
[2283.42 --> 2284.04]  With Breath of the Wild,
[2284.12 --> 2284.50]  So chat,
[2284.60 --> 2285.84]  If you guys have more details,
[2285.84 --> 2286.32]  Than me,
[2286.60 --> 2287.60]  I think the rumor,
[2287.96 --> 2289.38]  Is that these upgrade packs,
[2289.52 --> 2290.68]  Are going to be,
[2291.18 --> 2292.50]  Somewhere in the neighborhood,
[2292.88 --> 2293.26]  Of,
[2293.74 --> 2294.06]  Oh,
[2294.16 --> 2295.30]  This is interesting speculation,
[2295.84 --> 2296.06]  From,
[2296.40 --> 2297.18]  It doesn't actually say,
[2297.26 --> 2297.84]  Who the writer was,
[2297.88 --> 2298.76]  For this project here,
[2299.28 --> 2299.50]  But,
[2301.86 --> 2302.26]  Hmm,
[2302.72 --> 2304.60]  Listings for Switch 2 games,
[2304.60 --> 2305.94]  Are ranging from,
[2306.22 --> 2307.26]  70 to 90 USD,
[2307.26 --> 2308.82]  And so,
[2308.92 --> 2309.94]  With that in mind,
[2310.74 --> 2311.86]  They're speculating,
[2312.04 --> 2312.96]  That the upgrade packs,
[2313.04 --> 2314.10]  Could be 20 USD,
[2315.10 --> 2315.54]  Or more,
[2315.84 --> 2316.84]  I hope it's less,
[2317.40 --> 2318.66]  I was hoping for like,
[2319.24 --> 2319.48]  10,
[2319.62 --> 2321.20]  I was hoping for 10,
[2321.82 --> 2323.30]  Thinking probably 15,
[2323.46 --> 2324.32]  If it's 20,
[2324.76 --> 2325.36]  That is,
[2325.54 --> 2327.74]  That is way too much,
[2327.96 --> 2328.50]  To spend,
[2328.68 --> 2329.64]  On an upgrade,
[2330.06 --> 2330.62]  For a game,
[2330.70 --> 2331.30]  That realistically,
[2331.54 --> 2332.40]  I played as much,
[2332.40 --> 2333.32]  As I really needed to play,
[2333.40 --> 2334.10]  Seven years ago,
[2334.10 --> 2335.60]  Here's an interesting question,
[2336.10 --> 2337.48]  Is the first version,
[2337.58 --> 2338.14]  Compatible?
[2338.42 --> 2339.18]  Because it might be,
[2339.48 --> 2340.30]  You just might not be able,
[2340.30 --> 2341.60]  To run it at high resolutions,
[2341.74 --> 2342.98]  But I don't want to run it,
[2343.06 --> 2343.78]  At 30 FPS,
[2344.06 --> 2344.32]  No I know,
[2344.38 --> 2344.44]  I'm just saying,
[2344.44 --> 2345.60]  At least it'll be a solid,
[2345.60 --> 2346.82]  30 FPS this time,
[2346.88 --> 2347.20]  But like,
[2347.54 --> 2347.76]  Maybe,
[2348.02 --> 2349.82]  There's FPS elements to it,
[2349.86 --> 2350.96]  I have to aim the bow,
[2351.32 --> 2352.50]  And it would drop to like,
[2352.66 --> 2354.00]  17 frames per second,
[2354.08 --> 2354.60]  Like it's not,
[2355.26 --> 2355.54]  Obvious,
[2355.64 --> 2356.22]  Like obviously,
[2356.22 --> 2357.20]  I enjoyed the game,
[2357.20 --> 2358.22]  If I'm being honest,
[2358.28 --> 2359.96]  It's probably my favorite game,
[2360.52 --> 2360.82]  Ever,
[2361.88 --> 2362.08]  Right,
[2362.08 --> 2362.72]  Like I love,
[2363.02 --> 2363.88]  Zelda Breath of the Wild,
[2363.96 --> 2364.48]  I didn't get into,
[2364.68 --> 2365.12]  Tears of the Kingdom,
[2365.24 --> 2365.94]  Because it just felt like,
[2366.04 --> 2366.74]  Breath of the Wild again,
[2366.76 --> 2367.30]  So are you going to buy,
[2367.38 --> 2367.96]  An upgrade pack,
[2368.02 --> 2368.92]  For your favorite game ever,
[2369.50 --> 2371.80]  I don't want to play it again,
[2372.38 --> 2373.44]  I didn't even buy the DLC,
[2374.48 --> 2375.24]  If I wanted to play,
[2375.30 --> 2375.96]  Breath of the Wild again,
[2376.14 --> 2376.76]  You're just happy leaving it there,
[2376.78 --> 2377.38]  I'd probably buy,
[2377.44 --> 2377.88]  Tears of the Kingdom,
[2377.96 --> 2378.14]  Yeah,
[2378.24 --> 2378.74]  I felt,
[2378.88 --> 2380.76]  I put a freaking ton of hours,
[2380.76 --> 2381.04]  Into it,
[2381.04 --> 2382.28]  Like 250 plus hours,
[2382.28 --> 2382.30]  I've heard extremely good things,
[2382.30 --> 2383.02]  About Tears of the Kingdom,
[2383.46 --> 2384.10]  Me too,
[2384.20 --> 2385.94]  But I got a little ways into it,
[2385.96 --> 2386.38]  And I was like,
[2386.46 --> 2386.60]  Eh,
[2387.36 --> 2388.16]  I even bought it,
[2388.56 --> 2390.34]  And I was just like,
[2392.08 --> 2392.84]  Breath of the Wild again,
[2393.10 --> 2393.36]  Yeah,
[2393.98 --> 2395.44]  Whereas Breath of the Wild,
[2395.56 --> 2396.12]  Was like,
[2397.42 --> 2398.68]  Just such an,
[2398.86 --> 2399.66]  Outstanding,
[2400.00 --> 2400.70]  Breath of the Wild,
[2400.86 --> 2402.16]  And the Legend of Zelda,
[2402.32 --> 2403.10]  Tears of the Kingdom,
[2403.34 --> 2404.08]  Will be free,
[2404.22 --> 2404.88]  For Switch Online,
[2405.12 --> 2406.84]  Plus expansion pack subscribers,
[2407.48 --> 2407.98]  So,
[2408.10 --> 2408.16]  Yeah,
[2408.16 --> 2408.98]  But I don't have,
[2409.12 --> 2409.52]  Switch Online,
[2410.32 --> 2410.56]  Yeah,
[2410.66 --> 2412.04]  That means you pay for it,
[2412.98 --> 2414.16]  In installments,
[2414.46 --> 2414.72]  Yeah,
[2418.12 --> 2418.68]  Yeah,
[2419.18 --> 2420.44]  Okay,
[2420.54 --> 2420.82]  What else,
[2420.82 --> 2422.06]  What else we got to talk about here,
[2422.08 --> 2423.40]  You're going to buy Mario Kart World,
[2423.54 --> 2423.90]  Obviously,
[2424.04 --> 2424.18]  Right,
[2424.26 --> 2425.38]  So you buy it in the bundle,
[2426.08 --> 2426.26]  Yeah,
[2426.40 --> 2426.60]  Yeah,
[2426.68 --> 2426.92]  Okay,
[2427.88 --> 2428.62]  Discussion question,
[2428.76 --> 2429.52]  What do you think of the pricing,
[2429.52 --> 2430.64]  Of the console and games,
[2431.32 --> 2431.62]  Okay,
[2431.78 --> 2432.08]  Actually,
[2432.10 --> 2433.04]  I'm going to alter this one,
[2433.06 --> 2433.50]  A little bit,
[2433.92 --> 2434.74]  How do you think,
[2434.80 --> 2435.64]  Nintendo's,
[2435.72 --> 2437.16]  New game pricing paradigm,
[2437.84 --> 2438.00]  Will,
[2438.52 --> 2439.88]  What shockwaves,
[2439.94 --> 2440.78]  Do you think this will send,
[2440.88 --> 2441.40]  Throughout the rest,
[2441.42 --> 2442.18]  Of the gaming industry,
[2442.36 --> 2443.54]  I immediately saw people,
[2443.54 --> 2444.16]  Talking about,
[2444.30 --> 2445.04]  How stoked,
[2445.28 --> 2446.24]  Rockstar must be,
[2446.92 --> 2447.74]  With their like,
[2447.92 --> 2449.00]  Very possibly,
[2449.14 --> 2449.62]  Hundred dollar,
[2449.72 --> 2450.60]  GTA 6 coming,
[2450.60 --> 2452.00]  With this,
[2452.06 --> 2453.08]  $90 shift,
[2453.14 --> 2453.64]  For Nintendo,
[2454.12 --> 2455.30]  Softening that blow,
[2455.44 --> 2456.56]  From closer to a $20,
[2456.86 --> 2457.08]  Jump,
[2457.16 --> 2458.00]  To closer to a $10,
[2458.26 --> 2458.48]  Jump,
[2458.58 --> 2458.80]  Yeah,
[2459.08 --> 2459.76]  Um,
[2460.42 --> 2461.08]  It's interesting,
[2461.32 --> 2461.60]  I mean,
[2461.66 --> 2462.64]  We've been talking about this,
[2462.70 --> 2463.40]  For a long time,
[2463.44 --> 2464.06]  About how,
[2464.06 --> 2466.28]  Game prices are,
[2466.32 --> 2467.14]  Are going to be cooking,
[2467.20 --> 2468.00]  Over the next little bit,
[2468.06 --> 2469.10]  There's been incredible,
[2469.10 --> 2470.64]  Inflation over the last few years,
[2471.14 --> 2471.70]  Um,
[2472.22 --> 2472.70]  And,
[2472.88 --> 2473.18]  You know,
[2473.22 --> 2473.98]  It hits everything,
[2474.06 --> 2474.64]  So I'm not surprised,
[2474.70 --> 2475.28]  It's going up,
[2475.28 --> 2476.22]  In Canada,
[2476.34 --> 2477.28]  This is going to suck,
[2477.28 --> 2477.34]  Like,
[2477.88 --> 2478.68]  If the Canadian dollar,
[2478.78 --> 2479.58]  Is rough right now,
[2479.96 --> 2480.66]  Canadian average,
[2480.96 --> 2481.82]  GDP per person,
[2481.90 --> 2482.44]  Has been like,
[2483.02 --> 2484.18]  Essentially flat,
[2484.24 --> 2484.80]  For 10 years,
[2484.90 --> 2485.02]  Like,
[2485.20 --> 2485.46]  This is,
[2485.46 --> 2486.28]  This is going to be,
[2486.28 --> 2487.28]  Very rough,
[2487.46 --> 2488.26]  For any Canadians,
[2488.34 --> 2488.86]  Interested in buying,
[2488.90 --> 2489.50]  Nintendo products,
[2489.82 --> 2490.22]  And,
[2490.60 --> 2491.62]  Nintendo products sell,
[2491.72 --> 2491.92]  Man,
[2492.18 --> 2492.44]  Like,
[2493.12 --> 2494.42]  Regardless of,
[2494.48 --> 2495.46]  Economic situation,
[2495.74 --> 2496.30]  Regardless of,
[2496.30 --> 2497.12]  Practically anything,
[2497.62 --> 2498.84]  Nintendo products move,
[2498.88 --> 2499.64]  We did an episode,
[2500.04 --> 2500.46]  Of,
[2500.60 --> 2501.00]  Um,
[2501.12 --> 2501.76]  Setup doctor,
[2502.20 --> 2502.52]  Where,
[2502.74 --> 2502.92]  We,
[2503.00 --> 2503.72]  We did a setup,
[2504.10 --> 2504.38]  Uh,
[2504.38 --> 2505.54]  We carried the setup,
[2505.54 --> 2505.88]  Of,
[2505.94 --> 2506.62]  Of a viewer,
[2506.82 --> 2508.06]  And they literally,
[2508.20 --> 2509.00]  Have a collection,
[2510.14 --> 2510.40]  Of,
[2510.50 --> 2511.60]  Nintendo switch games,
[2511.84 --> 2512.44]  That is like,
[2512.54 --> 2512.64]  An,
[2512.84 --> 2513.72]  An entire wall,
[2514.02 --> 2515.72]  Like an entire bookshelf,
[2515.84 --> 2515.98]  Like,
[2516.02 --> 2516.70]  I think they said,
[2516.76 --> 2518.24]  They had almost every game,
[2518.44 --> 2519.64]  Or something like that,
[2519.92 --> 2520.80]  And I'm looking at this,
[2520.88 --> 2521.32]  Going like,
[2522.78 --> 2523.14]  100,
[2523.32 --> 2523.52]  200,
[2523.68 --> 2523.88]  300,
[2524.02 --> 2524.24]  400,
[2524.34 --> 2525.16]  1000,
[2525.38 --> 2525.78]  2000,
[2525.96 --> 2526.10]  Like,
[2526.32 --> 2527.90]  Like the amount of money in it,
[2528.24 --> 2528.62]  Is,
[2528.90 --> 2529.34]  Wild,
[2529.46 --> 2529.64]  Like,
[2529.86 --> 2530.86]  In Canadian dollars,
[2531.02 --> 2531.20]  Which,
[2531.42 --> 2532.02]  By the way,
[2532.36 --> 2533.26]  Are what we earn,
[2533.46 --> 2533.64]  Right?
[2533.72 --> 2533.88]  Like,
[2533.88 --> 2534.60]  We are,
[2535.16 --> 2536.38]  We don't really earn,
[2536.46 --> 2537.92]  Proportionally more Canadian dollars,
[2538.06 --> 2539.02]  Compared to US dollars,
[2539.64 --> 2540.00]  Like,
[2540.28 --> 2540.74]  Um,
[2541.12 --> 2541.96]  In Canadian dollars,
[2542.06 --> 2542.84]  A Nintendo game is like,
[2543.00 --> 2544.22]  90 dollars already,
[2544.86 --> 2546.18]  And that stings us,
[2546.18 --> 2546.20]  Yeah.
[2546.66 --> 2547.56]  Almost as hard,
[2547.62 --> 2548.08]  Not quite,
[2548.20 --> 2549.44]  But almost as hard,
[2549.68 --> 2551.52]  As a 90 US dollar game,
[2551.62 --> 2552.78]  Would sting a US buyer,
[2553.58 --> 2556.74]  Welcome to the party.
[2557.04 --> 2557.50]  It's tough.
[2558.20 --> 2558.94]  It's tough.
[2559.24 --> 2559.42]  Yeah.
[2559.98 --> 2560.20]  So,
[2560.34 --> 2560.52]  Like,
[2560.72 --> 2562.66]  The same thing that I said last time,
[2562.80 --> 2563.30]  Is honestly,
[2563.30 --> 2564.30]  I understand it,
[2564.78 --> 2567.48]  Games have not really tracked inflation super hard,
[2567.88 --> 2568.24]  Um,
[2568.24 --> 2569.68]  I think there's arguments for,
[2569.68 --> 2572.42]  Games being behind inflation,
[2572.42 --> 2573.34]  But then there's very,
[2573.44 --> 2573.60]  Very,
[2573.68 --> 2575.44]  Very strong counter arguments for,
[2575.88 --> 2576.20]  Yeah,
[2576.26 --> 2576.76]  But back then,
[2576.80 --> 2578.14]  You used to get the whole damn game,
[2578.14 --> 2578.88]  Um,
[2578.88 --> 2579.10]  Yeah.
[2579.10 --> 2579.90]  Now you have to,
[2579.90 --> 2580.96]  Buy DLC,
[2581.36 --> 2582.60]  Or there's skins that aren't included,
[2582.72 --> 2583.02]  And when you're like,
[2583.08 --> 2583.24]  Oh,
[2583.30 --> 2584.30]  But skins are just cosmetics.
[2584.52 --> 2586.54]  Don't forget about your subscription to play online.
[2586.76 --> 2587.00]  Yeah,
[2587.12 --> 2587.60]  That's,
[2587.60 --> 2589.06]  Rough and stupid as well,
[2589.14 --> 2589.30]  But,
[2589.64 --> 2589.98]  Um,
[2590.22 --> 2591.60]  Back in my day,
[2592.12 --> 2592.38]  There,
[2592.38 --> 2594.86]  There wasn't skins for cosmetics and fully paid games.
[2594.90 --> 2595.94]  It was just like League of Legends.
[2596.34 --> 2596.70]  And,
[2596.70 --> 2600.04]  There used to be like quest chains and content that you would do,
[2600.10 --> 2603.56]  And the reward was those cool looking things or whatever else.
[2604.00 --> 2604.34]  Um,
[2604.34 --> 2604.80]  So there's,
[2604.84 --> 2607.18]  There's content that is missing from your game.
[2607.28 --> 2610.10]  You are not getting a complete game if the game includes paid skins,
[2610.18 --> 2610.66]  In my opinion.
[2610.66 --> 2611.64]  Um,
[2612.54 --> 2612.86]  So,
[2613.08 --> 2613.48]  Yeah,
[2613.56 --> 2613.82]  That's,
[2613.90 --> 2614.64]  That's rough.
[2614.80 --> 2615.18]  And,
[2615.46 --> 2616.70]  There's a certain amount of like,
[2616.82 --> 2617.90]  Will the market bear it?
[2618.58 --> 2620.72]  Dyslexic stoner for a 240,
[2621.00 --> 2623.02]  Brings up a really good point here,
[2623.10 --> 2624.96]  That I had actually meant to discuss earlier.
[2625.54 --> 2627.26]  Game devs are going to have to decide,
[2627.48 --> 2627.68]  Yeah.
[2627.68 --> 2628.56]  If they want margins,
[2628.94 --> 2630.04]  Or high player counts.
[2630.30 --> 2630.42]  Yeah.
[2630.48 --> 2634.36]  And this was something that I had wanted to include in the discussion around,
[2634.90 --> 2635.22]  Um,
[2635.24 --> 2636.08]  How the fact that,
[2636.14 --> 2636.34]  You know,
[2636.56 --> 2639.62]  How the SNES was the same price when I was a kid,
[2639.62 --> 2642.26]  As the Switch 2 is today when you account for inflation.
[2643.12 --> 2643.44]  But,
[2644.10 --> 2644.58]  But,
[2645.16 --> 2646.40]  The gaming industry,
[2647.10 --> 2648.28]  Is way bigger.
[2649.06 --> 2650.38]  Orders of magnitude,
[2650.86 --> 2652.78]  Larger than what it was when I was a kid.
[2653.00 --> 2654.44]  And games were for kids,
[2654.78 --> 2656.54]  And game consoles were,
[2656.66 --> 2657.44]  Were,
[2658.14 --> 2659.02]  Luxurious,
[2659.68 --> 2662.06]  Incredible presence for children,
[2662.54 --> 2663.54]  From their parents.
[2663.86 --> 2664.08]  You know,
[2664.12 --> 2664.78]  Like it wasn't,
[2664.98 --> 2665.90]  And we didn't have,
[2666.16 --> 2667.14]  There was no phone,
[2667.34 --> 2667.58]  Right?
[2668.26 --> 2668.50]  So,
[2668.60 --> 2669.60]  So I didn't get a phone.
[2669.60 --> 2670.24]  Interesting thing.
[2670.26 --> 2671.26]  So that would be the equivalent,
[2671.76 --> 2671.94]  Right?
[2672.06 --> 2672.24]  Like,
[2672.54 --> 2672.82]  You know,
[2672.90 --> 2673.22]  Your,
[2673.64 --> 2673.94]  You know,
[2674.94 --> 2676.92]  Like kind of cheapo Android phone,
[2677.00 --> 2678.66]  That your parents might give you when you're 10,
[2679.08 --> 2679.34]  And,
[2679.68 --> 2680.88]  Don't kid yourself,
[2681.00 --> 2683.06]  A lot of my kids friends have phones,
[2683.20 --> 2683.68]  By about,
[2683.76 --> 2684.42]  By about 10.
[2685.88 --> 2687.16]  If they get one of those,
[2687.32 --> 2687.46]  Well,
[2687.52 --> 2688.68]  They would get no game console.
[2689.10 --> 2689.26]  You know,
[2689.30 --> 2689.42]  Like,
[2689.52 --> 2689.78]  Like,
[2689.84 --> 2690.96]  Like that was what we got,
[2691.06 --> 2692.50]  Instead of having a phone,
[2692.54 --> 2692.98]  Or an iPad,
[2693.18 --> 2693.90]  Or whatever else.
[2694.78 --> 2695.12]  Um,
[2695.40 --> 2696.76]  So if they want,
[2697.38 --> 2697.82]  If they,
[2697.82 --> 2699.40]  If they want the volumes,
[2699.40 --> 2700.72]  That they have enjoyed,
[2700.72 --> 2701.80]  Over the last 10 years,
[2702.56 --> 2703.74]  They may not,
[2703.74 --> 2704.42]  See them.
[2704.88 --> 2706.00]  And in that sense,
[2706.24 --> 2707.36]  Even if the Switch 2,
[2707.46 --> 2709.38]  Ends up being a very profitable generation,
[2709.54 --> 2709.96]  For Nintendo,
[2710.24 --> 2712.04]  It may not,
[2712.28 --> 2713.90]  Go anywhere near their podium,
[2714.40 --> 2715.64]  In terms of the volume,
[2715.74 --> 2716.88]  Of game consoles sold.
[2716.88 --> 2718.44]  Like,
[2718.50 --> 2719.68]  If you look at Nintendo's,
[2719.76 --> 2721.38]  Most sold consoles,
[2721.56 --> 2721.90]  What was it?
[2721.92 --> 2723.50]  Some DS of some form or other,
[2723.56 --> 2723.68]  Right?
[2723.68 --> 2723.76]  Yeah,
[2723.78 --> 2724.20]  I think so.
[2724.28 --> 2725.34]  Is their top one,
[2725.40 --> 2726.38]  If I recall correctly.
[2727.04 --> 2728.56]  That was really affordable.
[2729.36 --> 2730.30]  Super affordable.
[2732.18 --> 2732.62]  Yeah.
[2733.96 --> 2734.24]  Uh,
[2734.24 --> 2735.42]  To your point on,
[2735.42 --> 2736.20]  It being like,
[2736.28 --> 2737.26]  Presents for kids,
[2737.78 --> 2738.26]  Uh,
[2738.34 --> 2739.50]  Up until the Switch,
[2739.78 --> 2741.34]  Most Nintendo consoles came out,
[2741.40 --> 2741.80]  In like,
[2741.92 --> 2742.82]  September or November,
[2743.26 --> 2744.22]  Close to holiday season.
[2744.46 --> 2744.58]  Yeah.
[2744.60 --> 2745.58]  And then their original Switch,
[2745.64 --> 2746.28]  Came out in March.
[2746.88 --> 2747.56]  Because,
[2748.06 --> 2748.46]  Now,
[2748.74 --> 2749.82]  People just buy consoles,
[2749.92 --> 2750.40]  All year round.
[2750.78 --> 2750.94]  But,
[2751.08 --> 2751.26]  Oh,
[2751.34 --> 2752.10]  So I remember it,
[2752.10 --> 2753.06]  When I was a kid,
[2753.94 --> 2754.42]  It was,
[2754.56 --> 2755.68]  It was just Christmas,
[2755.82 --> 2756.78]  That everybody got consoles.
[2756.90 --> 2757.18]  Oh yeah,
[2757.24 --> 2758.10]  It was a Christmas present,
[2758.26 --> 2758.46]  And,
[2758.60 --> 2759.62]  Or nothing else.
[2759.92 --> 2760.20]  So,
[2760.40 --> 2761.60]  I think I've told the story before,
[2761.60 --> 2762.64]  About how my Super Nintendo,
[2762.82 --> 2763.54]  Was actually stolen,
[2764.22 --> 2764.54]  Uh,
[2764.56 --> 2766.00]  Before it was given to me.
[2766.62 --> 2766.88]  So,
[2767.04 --> 2767.20]  My,
[2767.26 --> 2768.46]  My aunt got me the bundle,
[2768.62 --> 2769.42]  With the two controllers,
[2769.62 --> 2770.56]  And Super Mario World,
[2771.04 --> 2771.48]  And,
[2771.60 --> 2771.98]  Um,
[2772.32 --> 2773.16]  But it was actually,
[2773.24 --> 2774.02]  She was robbed,
[2774.72 --> 2774.98]  Like,
[2775.08 --> 2776.32]  In the week before Christmas,
[2776.32 --> 2778.34]  And she moved heaven and earth,
[2778.42 --> 2779.66]  To try to find me another one,
[2780.14 --> 2780.64]  Um,
[2780.70 --> 2781.78]  And couldn't get,
[2781.92 --> 2782.18]  Like,
[2782.22 --> 2783.00]  The bundle one,
[2783.36 --> 2783.94]  And so,
[2784.10 --> 2785.16]  It was funny because,
[2785.28 --> 2785.54]  Uh,
[2785.60 --> 2786.82]  I still remember this,
[2787.10 --> 2788.56]  She apologized to me,
[2789.00 --> 2789.92]  On Christmas morning,
[2789.92 --> 2790.92]  That it wasn't like,
[2790.92 --> 2792.92]  The one that I could play with my friends,
[2793.42 --> 2793.78]  But dude,
[2793.84 --> 2794.90]  I was just so stoked,
[2795.02 --> 2795.20]  Yeah,
[2795.42 --> 2796.88]  To have a Super Nintendo at all,
[2796.96 --> 2797.24]  Like,
[2797.38 --> 2798.18]  I was like,
[2798.20 --> 2799.42]  What are you even talking about?
[2800.26 --> 2801.68]  We can share the controller around,
[2801.74 --> 2802.08]  Who cares?
[2802.56 --> 2802.88]  It's like,
[2802.92 --> 2803.44]  This is so cool,
[2803.48 --> 2803.84]  Don't worry,
[2803.90 --> 2804.02]  No,
[2804.10 --> 2804.24]  No,
[2804.32 --> 2804.78]  My aunt,
[2804.94 --> 2805.06]  She,
[2805.14 --> 2806.22]  She found me a Nintendo,
[2806.34 --> 2807.20]  I don't know how she did it,
[2807.20 --> 2807.54]  Of course she did.
[2807.64 --> 2808.96]  I had one on Christmas morning,
[2809.02 --> 2810.30]  It just didn't have two controllers,
[2810.96 --> 2811.28]  Um,
[2811.28 --> 2811.66]  And I don't,
[2811.92 --> 2812.82]  I don't think it had,
[2812.92 --> 2813.24]  Um,
[2813.82 --> 2814.08]  Uh,
[2814.20 --> 2815.56]  Did it have Super Mario World?
[2815.76 --> 2817.40]  It definitely didn't have two controllers,
[2817.52 --> 2818.78]  There were two versions of the,
[2818.84 --> 2819.50]  Of the console.
[2819.50 --> 2820.16]  Uh,
[2820.16 --> 2820.44]  Oh dude,
[2820.50 --> 2821.24]  My aunt's amazing,
[2821.42 --> 2821.82]  She's,
[2821.90 --> 2822.10]  Uh,
[2822.10 --> 2823.58]  She is one of the closest members,
[2823.58 --> 2825.38]  Of my extended family,
[2825.56 --> 2825.70]  She,
[2825.82 --> 2827.20]  She comes over every week,
[2827.36 --> 2828.54]  Spends a ton of time with our kids,
[2828.62 --> 2829.48]  She is actually,
[2830.14 --> 2830.54]  Um,
[2830.76 --> 2832.40]  If I wasn't married to Yvonne,
[2832.50 --> 2833.08]  I would say,
[2833.20 --> 2835.00]  My aunt is the best lady,
[2835.00 --> 2835.60]  In the entire,
[2835.60 --> 2836.06]  She's very cool,
[2836.12 --> 2836.90]  In the entire world,
[2837.02 --> 2837.80]  She's incredible.
[2837.98 --> 2838.90]  Dee Hollinger said,
[2839.06 --> 2839.28]  Uh,
[2839.28 --> 2839.64]  Yvonne,
[2839.70 --> 2840.18]  You're number one,
[2840.28 --> 2840.80]  You're number one.
[2840.92 --> 2841.54]  I'm going to point out again,
[2841.60 --> 2842.52]  That game devs make less,
[2842.64 --> 2842.92]  Actually,
[2843.18 --> 2843.56]  You know what,
[2843.74 --> 2845.00]  My mother-in-law is actually,
[2845.30 --> 2845.94]  Amazing too.
[2846.20 --> 2847.52]  Words that have never been,
[2847.96 --> 2849.22]  Said before in that order.
[2849.50 --> 2850.08]  Ha ha ha!
[2851.66 --> 2852.32]  That's true,
[2852.56 --> 2853.32]  Unless you're like,
[2853.72 --> 2854.08]  Uh,
[2854.16 --> 2855.40]  At practically gunpoint.
[2855.42 --> 2855.88]  Gilmore Dee,
[2855.94 --> 2856.20]  Yes,
[2856.30 --> 2858.18]  This is the aunt that gives me art,
[2858.38 --> 2859.10]  Like that Yoda,
[2859.26 --> 2859.92]  That weird Yoda,
[2860.02 --> 2861.06]  That's in my gaming room,
[2861.50 --> 2862.00]  Um,
[2862.58 --> 2863.36]  And yes,
[2863.36 --> 2864.94]  This is the one that makes me borscht.
[2865.24 --> 2865.56]  Alright,
[2865.82 --> 2866.32]  Dee Hollinger,
[2866.50 --> 2866.84]  Uh,
[2866.90 --> 2867.62]  I'm going to point out again,
[2867.72 --> 2868.90]  That most game devs make less,
[2868.98 --> 2869.68]  With fewer benefits,
[2869.78 --> 2871.38]  Than non-gaming counterparts too.
[2871.78 --> 2872.08]  Also,
[2872.24 --> 2873.16]  Triple A game companies,
[2873.38 --> 2873.94]  Uh,
[2873.98 --> 2875.78]  May need to go back to making double A games,
[2875.82 --> 2876.76]  Instead of triple A games,
[2876.92 --> 2877.60]  Uh,
[2877.66 --> 2879.32]  That cost more to make the blockbuster,
[2879.50 --> 2880.08]  Movie.
[2880.44 --> 2881.00]  Uh,
[2881.08 --> 2882.48]  I have thoughts on this,
[2882.66 --> 2883.20]  Um,
[2883.28 --> 2883.76]  One,
[2883.90 --> 2885.84]  A lot of the game devs making less,
[2885.88 --> 2886.46]  With fewer benefits,
[2886.46 --> 2887.48]  Is because it's a,
[2887.92 --> 2888.64]  In a lot of ways,
[2888.70 --> 2889.20]  In my opinion,
[2889.44 --> 2890.38]  A predatory industry,
[2890.38 --> 2892.78]  Where people want to work,
[2892.94 --> 2894.62]  People say they want to make games,
[2894.88 --> 2895.02]  Yeah.
[2895.02 --> 2896.26]  From when they are very young,
[2896.40 --> 2897.64]  And it is a dream,
[2897.70 --> 2898.46]  And an aspiration,
[2898.88 --> 2899.28]  So,
[2899.58 --> 2900.68]  Gaming companies kind of,
[2900.80 --> 2901.46]  Abuse them.
[2901.80 --> 2902.04]  Um,
[2902.04 --> 2902.48]  Also,
[2902.86 --> 2905.06]  Gaming companies needing to go from triple A to double A,
[2905.46 --> 2906.10]  Um,
[2906.84 --> 2909.40]  I don't know,
[2909.56 --> 2910.58]  There's good games out there,
[2910.62 --> 2912.04]  That sure sell a heck of a lot,
[2912.12 --> 2913.94]  And there's a lot of trash games out there,
[2914.04 --> 2914.24]  So,
[2914.42 --> 2914.60]  Yeah,
[2914.70 --> 2916.72]  Both in the double A and triple A categories.
[2916.72 --> 2918.82]  Maybe if you're making quadruple A games,
[2918.88 --> 2920.00]  That just suck,
[2920.26 --> 2921.42]  They're not going to sell it all,
[2921.82 --> 2922.28]  Um,
[2922.28 --> 2923.70]  And maybe if you just made the game,
[2923.76 --> 2925.32]  That everyone on the freaking planet,
[2925.32 --> 2926.14]  Asked you to make,
[2926.42 --> 2927.30]  And then sold it,
[2927.48 --> 2928.96]  People would be really happy with that.
[2929.04 --> 2929.68]  Which specific game are you talking about?
[2929.68 --> 2930.38]  And would have bought it.
[2930.76 --> 2931.54]  Skull and Bones.
[2931.80 --> 2932.06]  Oh.
[2932.36 --> 2933.98]  They called it a quadruple A game.
[2934.10 --> 2934.32]  Oh no,
[2934.36 --> 2934.44]  No,
[2934.44 --> 2934.78]  I mean,
[2934.94 --> 2935.22]  Um,
[2935.62 --> 2935.92]  Oh,
[2936.00 --> 2938.30]  You mean if they had just made it like Assassin's Creed.
[2938.54 --> 2939.94]  Just make Black Flag,
[2940.02 --> 2941.34]  But take the Assassin's Creed part out,
[2941.40 --> 2943.52]  Because no one cared about the Assassin's Creed part.
[2943.74 --> 2944.00]  Even,
[2944.18 --> 2945.92]  I was a huge Assassin's Creed fan.
[2946.02 --> 2946.16]  Yeah.
[2946.16 --> 2947.58]  Did not care about the Assassin's Creed part.
[2947.72 --> 2949.02]  I never beat Black Flag.
[2949.64 --> 2950.04]  Really?
[2950.28 --> 2952.12]  I played the heck out of that game.
[2952.54 --> 2954.20]  The worst part of that game,
[2954.32 --> 2956.56]  Is all of the Assassin's Creed parts that you have to do,
[2956.72 --> 2957.76]  Until you get your boat.
[2958.82 --> 2959.76]  When you get your boat,
[2959.88 --> 2960.76]  The game is amazing.
[2961.32 --> 2962.28]  Just make that.
[2962.78 --> 2963.26]  Like,
[2963.48 --> 2964.66]  My god.
[2965.02 --> 2966.38]  Not listening to fans,
[2966.70 --> 2968.98]  Making huge giant art pieces that,
[2969.16 --> 2970.02]  That no one wants,
[2970.10 --> 2971.08]  Focusing on the wrong things,
[2971.14 --> 2972.86]  Not making games actually fun.
[2973.28 --> 2973.52]  Like,
[2975.20 --> 2975.68]  Anyways,
[2975.68 --> 2976.22]  Uh,
[2976.22 --> 2979.24]  There's a reason why certain companies in the gaming space are struggling,
[2979.24 --> 2981.54]  And there's a reason why other games in the,
[2981.60 --> 2982.22]  In the gaming,
[2982.36 --> 2982.52]  Sorry,
[2982.64 --> 2985.44]  Other companies in the gaming industry are thriving right now.
[2985.44 --> 2987.22]  And a lot of them are newer,
[2987.36 --> 2988.64]  A lot of them are offshoots.
[2988.98 --> 2989.38]  Um,
[2989.38 --> 2989.56]  You,
[2989.62 --> 2990.82]  You can't look at the gaming industry,
[2990.82 --> 2992.80]  And say that it's necessarily doing super poorly,
[2992.80 --> 2994.56]  When we had massive,
[2994.86 --> 2995.22]  Like,
[2995.40 --> 2996.06]  Huge profits.
[2996.44 --> 2997.28]  Huge profits,
[2997.40 --> 2997.46]  Huge profits,
[2997.46 --> 2999.10]  And huge cultural moments.
[2999.76 --> 2999.90]  Yeah.
[2999.90 --> 2999.92]  Like,
[3000.00 --> 3001.02]  Helldivers was,
[3002.16 --> 3005.02]  Helldivers changed how people communicated on the internet,
[3005.16 --> 3006.46]  For a substantial period of time.
[3007.22 --> 3007.56]  Um,
[3007.56 --> 3007.74]  Like,
[3007.74 --> 3008.42]  People were like,
[3008.54 --> 3009.60]  Oddly patriotic,
[3009.74 --> 3011.30]  Because of a video game,
[3011.70 --> 3012.12]  For like,
[3012.22 --> 3012.70]  Months.
[3013.14 --> 3013.38]  Yeah.
[3013.68 --> 3014.16]  Um,
[3014.36 --> 3015.82]  Baldur's Gate 3 was enormous.
[3016.00 --> 3016.40]  Huge moment.
[3016.60 --> 3018.24]  There's still these huge,
[3018.38 --> 3019.36]  Crazy launches.
[3019.62 --> 3019.76]  Yeah,
[3019.80 --> 3020.56]  And not always,
[3020.56 --> 3021.28]  Not always,
[3021.28 --> 3021.50]  Like,
[3021.58 --> 3022.28]  Triple A games.
[3022.42 --> 3022.54]  I mean,
[3022.60 --> 3023.92]  Neither of those are technically triple A.
[3023.92 --> 3024.18]  Look at,
[3024.18 --> 3024.34]  Like,
[3024.48 --> 3024.98]  Fall Guys,
[3025.08 --> 3025.24]  Okay,
[3025.28 --> 3026.46]  It was a little longer ago,
[3026.92 --> 3027.12]  But,
[3027.22 --> 3027.74]  Jude,
[3028.24 --> 3028.42]  That,
[3028.52 --> 3028.80]  Explode,
[3028.88 --> 3029.44]  Pal World.
[3029.58 --> 3030.38]  But the common,
[3030.64 --> 3030.98]  Yeah,
[3031.20 --> 3033.14]  The common thread here is that they're fun.
[3033.70 --> 3033.92]  Yeah.
[3034.02 --> 3035.36]  A lot of triple A games just like,
[3035.46 --> 3037.16]  Genuinely aren't that fun anymore.
[3037.66 --> 3038.22]  And it's like,
[3038.40 --> 3039.38]  That's the problem.
[3039.46 --> 3039.76]  The problem,
[3039.84 --> 3040.10]  In my opinion,
[3040.20 --> 3041.56]  Isn't the fact that they're triple A games.
[3041.74 --> 3043.34]  The fact is that they're not just fun.
[3043.48 --> 3043.58]  They,
[3043.68 --> 3044.58]  They're missing the,
[3044.58 --> 3047.02]  The core component of what a game is supposed to be.
[3047.20 --> 3047.40]  Yeah,
[3047.58 --> 3049.34]  DME95 says,
[3049.44 --> 3051.34]  Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is amazing,
[3051.78 --> 3054.72]  And came from a smaller studio that got its original start on Kickstarter,
[3054.72 --> 3055.54]  Of all places.
[3055.76 --> 3055.94]  Yeah.
[3056.94 --> 3057.30]  Yeah.
[3058.00 --> 3058.40]  I don't know.
[3058.54 --> 3058.94]  Anyways,
[3059.34 --> 3060.46]  I think,
[3060.86 --> 3063.12]  Devs being paid less on average in the gaming industry,
[3063.26 --> 3066.76]  Is not necessarily a reflection of the cost of a game cart.
[3067.00 --> 3067.24]  But,
[3067.34 --> 3073.30]  You've also talked about how you think that there's something of a great reset happening in the game industry right now.
[3073.62 --> 3076.06]  Where talented people are losing their jobs,
[3076.14 --> 3077.60]  Not because they've done a bad job,
[3077.68 --> 3078.34]  But because,
[3079.22 --> 3081.64]  Companies do company lay off things.
[3081.82 --> 3084.32]  There's amazing games with great sales and great reviews,
[3084.32 --> 3086.10]  That are having their entire teams get laid off.
[3086.14 --> 3087.84]  And then those people are going to go,
[3087.84 --> 3088.68]  And they're going to,
[3088.68 --> 3089.26]  They're going to,
[3089.26 --> 3090.52]  They're going to start up.
[3090.68 --> 3090.96]  They're going to,
[3091.04 --> 3092.54]  Whether they do indie solo games,
[3092.58 --> 3093.94]  Or whether they start small studios,
[3094.14 --> 3095.86]  Some of those are going to make it to market,
[3096.08 --> 3097.96]  And those people are going to reap the rewards,
[3098.12 --> 3100.04]  And their companies are going to grow,
[3100.28 --> 3100.76]  And then,
[3100.76 --> 3103.32]  What I'm seeing as AAA games failing,
[3103.76 --> 3105.56]  Is less AAA games failing,
[3105.88 --> 3107.60]  And it's more giant,
[3107.90 --> 3108.38]  Old,
[3108.60 --> 3109.24]  Behemoth,
[3109.92 --> 3110.48]  Slow,
[3110.76 --> 3111.64]  Bad companies,
[3112.08 --> 3113.38]  Starting to take it on the chin.
[3114.06 --> 3115.06]  Because you're seeing games like,
[3115.10 --> 3115.26]  Like,
[3115.30 --> 3117.18]  Baldur's Gate 3 is not a AAA game.
[3117.68 --> 3117.94]  Right,
[3118.00 --> 3118.16]  Right,
[3118.16 --> 3118.30]  Right,
[3118.30 --> 3118.48]  Right,
[3118.48 --> 3118.50]  Right,
[3118.50 --> 3118.60]  Right.
[3118.66 --> 3118.92]  I mean,
[3118.96 --> 3120.46]  It's AAA in terms of the quality.
[3120.76 --> 3121.20]  Exactly.
[3121.20 --> 3122.74]  But if you look at it in the way that,
[3122.84 --> 3124.16]  Almost everyone would,
[3124.16 --> 3126.66]  Ignorantly evaluate games as AAA,
[3127.02 --> 3127.12]  Or,
[3127.12 --> 3127.72]  Or single A,
[3127.74 --> 3128.00]  Or whatever,
[3128.22 --> 3129.26]  Without being in the industry,
[3129.54 --> 3131.02]  Everyone's going to think it's a AAA game.
[3131.16 --> 3131.28]  Right.
[3131.30 --> 3132.14]  It looks great,
[3132.36 --> 3133.44]  The story's,
[3133.44 --> 3134.46]  Incredibly deep.
[3134.46 --> 3135.02]  Voice acting.
[3135.22 --> 3136.48]  The voice acting is amazing.
[3136.80 --> 3138.80]  All these things that you would expect from a AAA game,
[3139.00 --> 3140.38]  Are in Baldur's Gate 3.
[3141.94 --> 3144.30]  I understand there isn't a ton of modes and stuff,
[3144.40 --> 3145.10]  For Helldivers,
[3145.62 --> 3147.60]  But I bet you most people would look at Helldivers,
[3147.68 --> 3149.00]  And think of it as a,
[3149.00 --> 3150.16]  A AAA release.
[3150.20 --> 3150.34]  Yeah.
[3150.34 --> 3150.74]  Um,
[3151.24 --> 3152.84]  And it absolutely wasn't.
[3152.94 --> 3153.28]  So like,
[3153.38 --> 3153.56]  It's,
[3153.56 --> 3153.88]  It's,
[3153.88 --> 3158.62]  It's more the type of company that's failing in my mind,
[3158.68 --> 3160.02]  Instead of the type of game.
[3160.28 --> 3160.46]  Okay,
[3160.62 --> 3161.76]  Athos asks you,
[3161.90 --> 3163.34]  Would Breath of the Wild be a AAA game?
[3164.96 --> 3165.40]  Uh,
[3165.86 --> 3167.12]  I don't remember.
[3167.28 --> 3169.12]  I don't remember the exact defining features,
[3169.20 --> 3169.86]  But I think it is.
[3169.90 --> 3170.02]  I,
[3170.02 --> 3170.98]  I would think so.
[3171.48 --> 3171.76]  I mean,
[3171.84 --> 3172.20]  It's,
[3173.02 --> 3173.70]  To me,
[3173.88 --> 3174.22]  Like,
[3174.36 --> 3174.54]  Oh,
[3174.64 --> 3175.42]  Is it,
[3175.50 --> 3176.52]  Is it well defined?
[3177.08 --> 3179.12]  Because I'm sure Nintendo spent the money on it.
[3179.12 --> 3181.10]  It sold consoles,
[3181.70 --> 3181.88]  Like,
[3182.00 --> 3183.36]  Or was expected to.
[3183.78 --> 3184.90]  I would say there's kind of,
[3184.98 --> 3185.20]  Part of,
[3185.20 --> 3189.10]  Part of being AAA is like an expectation of performance in the market.
[3190.14 --> 3190.46]  Um,
[3190.46 --> 3194.24]  AAA refers to high budget blockbuster titles with extensive resources.
[3194.44 --> 3194.88]  Well,
[3194.98 --> 3199.76]  AA represents games that fall between indie and AAA in terms of budget and resources.
[3199.76 --> 3201.00]  So that's why I would say,
[3201.36 --> 3201.64]  Like,
[3201.76 --> 3203.66]  Larian Studios and Arrowhead.
[3203.66 --> 3204.22]  So,
[3204.38 --> 3206.78]  Baldur's Gate 3 and Helldivers are in the,
[3206.78 --> 3206.98]  The,
[3206.98 --> 3207.32]  The,
[3207.32 --> 3208.44]  The AA category.
[3208.64 --> 3208.96]  Uh,
[3208.96 --> 3210.06]  They're not an indie game.
[3210.14 --> 3211.60]  It's not two to five devs,
[3211.60 --> 3215.38]  But it's also not EA games or Ubisoft or Bethesda or,
[3215.38 --> 3217.08]  Or whatever making it.
[3217.42 --> 3217.70]  Um,
[3217.70 --> 3218.06]  So yeah,
[3218.08 --> 3219.90]  I would think that Breath of the Wild would,
[3219.98 --> 3221.68]  I wasn't sure because it was like,
[3222.50 --> 3224.84]  First party to the manufacturer of a console.
[3225.50 --> 3226.82]  I wasn't sure what that meant,
[3227.00 --> 3229.78]  But that absolutely falls under it based on this definition at least.
[3230.96 --> 3231.74]  Makes sense.
[3231.74 --> 3232.34]  Yeah.
[3232.94 --> 3233.40]  All right.
[3233.48 --> 3235.34]  Should we move on from the Nintendo Switch?
[3238.12 --> 3238.52]  Oh,
[3238.62 --> 3238.82]  okay.
[3238.90 --> 3240.42]  Dan wants us to do merch messages.
[3241.08 --> 3241.52]  Um,
[3241.66 --> 3242.00]  Sure.
[3242.24 --> 3242.64]  Only if you want,
[3242.68 --> 3243.58]  Or you can do another topic.
[3244.08 --> 3244.52]  Um,
[3246.36 --> 3246.76]  Oh,
[3247.04 --> 3247.96]  should we get the,
[3247.96 --> 3249.68]  Should we get the tariff stuff talked about?
[3250.50 --> 3251.02]  We can.
[3251.20 --> 3253.00]  That's a decently sized topic though,
[3253.02 --> 3253.28]  I think,
[3253.36 --> 3253.62]  Isn't it?
[3253.88 --> 3254.24]  Um,
[3254.34 --> 3255.02]  We might as well.
[3255.14 --> 3255.44]  No,
[3255.56 --> 3257.82]  It's more just us kind of talking through.
[3257.96 --> 3258.16]  It's,
[3258.38 --> 3259.50]  It's more of like a,
[3259.66 --> 3259.90]  Oh,
[3260.52 --> 3260.92]  No,
[3260.92 --> 3262.04]  It's a pretty heavy statement.
[3262.84 --> 3263.24]  Or it's a,
[3263.24 --> 3263.54]  It's a,
[3263.72 --> 3264.00]  Okay,
[3264.08 --> 3266.44]  Let's do the LTT store side,
[3266.54 --> 3267.74]  And then we'll get into a little bit,
[3267.86 --> 3268.22]  No,
[3268.34 --> 3268.54]  Okay.
[3268.64 --> 3268.84]  Yeah,
[3268.88 --> 3269.90]  Let's just do merch messages.
[3270.02 --> 3270.18]  Okay,
[3270.26 --> 3270.46]  Fine,
[3270.52 --> 3270.62]  Dan.
[3271.44 --> 3271.84]  Uh,
[3271.84 --> 3273.80]  Let's talk about what the heck a merch message is.
[3273.80 --> 3274.08]  So,
[3274.08 --> 3274.10]  So,
[3274.16 --> 3275.02]  We don't do Twitch bits,
[3275.08 --> 3275.98]  We don't do super chats,
[3276.10 --> 3277.70]  We do merch messages.
[3277.92 --> 3281.16]  Those are the way to interact with the show live.
[3281.36 --> 3282.84]  We love interacting with you guys.
[3283.04 --> 3287.20]  And we have some special stuff that you guys can check out on the store today.
[3287.20 --> 3288.34]  Unfortunately,
[3288.76 --> 3290.50]  Demand for the,
[3290.50 --> 3290.90]  Um,
[3290.98 --> 3298.98]  Firewall department t-shirts that we had for April Fool's this year was much greater than we anticipated.
[3299.44 --> 3301.46]  And I've had quite a few people ask me,
[3301.58 --> 3307.60]  How the heck it is that you can be sold out of a custom print to order t-shirt?
[3307.60 --> 3308.68]  And the answer is,
[3308.80 --> 3310.26]  When you run out of the blanks,
[3310.90 --> 3312.00]  That it goes on.
[3312.86 --> 3313.96]  Is how that happens.
[3314.24 --> 3314.60]  So,
[3314.68 --> 3315.00]  Unfortunately,
[3315.18 --> 3316.06]  We don't have those,
[3316.16 --> 3318.96]  But what we do have is the custom,
[3319.28 --> 3319.96]  Uh,
[3320.04 --> 3320.82]  Water bottles.
[3321.38 --> 3325.42]  And you can see those here in the front of the fire truck.
[3326.30 --> 3326.62]  Yes,
[3326.78 --> 3327.18]  Thank you,
[3327.22 --> 3327.44]  Luke.
[3327.62 --> 3327.86]  Uh,
[3327.88 --> 3328.58]  Do we have a,
[3328.76 --> 3328.98]  No,
[3329.06 --> 3329.62]  We have no,
[3329.68 --> 3330.34]  I don't think so.
[3330.48 --> 3330.60]  Yeah,
[3330.60 --> 3331.58]  We just got the one cam.
[3331.64 --> 3332.68]  We got the one cam today.
[3333.14 --> 3333.42]  Uh,
[3333.42 --> 3335.38]  So the thirst extinguisher fire truck here,
[3335.44 --> 3335.92]  We'll just go,
[3336.00 --> 3336.20]  Uh,
[3336.20 --> 3336.82]  Linus laptop.
[3336.94 --> 3337.08]  Boom,
[3337.14 --> 3337.54]  There we go.
[3338.26 --> 3338.66]  Um,
[3338.92 --> 3339.18]  Hey,
[3339.30 --> 3343.02]  I know why I clicked the wrong thing earlier when I was trying to show my laptop.
[3343.18 --> 3343.76]  Me too.
[3343.92 --> 3345.04]  Why am I in the driver's seat?
[3345.10 --> 3346.48]  I'm on the wrong side of the WAN show.
[3346.52 --> 3346.66]  Wait,
[3346.74 --> 3346.84]  No,
[3346.86 --> 3348.08]  I'm not on the wrong side of the WAN show.
[3348.78 --> 3349.08]  Am I on?
[3349.34 --> 3349.62]  No,
[3349.72 --> 3349.84]  Yeah,
[3349.86 --> 3350.48]  You're backwards.
[3350.66 --> 3350.86]  Yeah,
[3350.94 --> 3351.10]  Yeah,
[3351.10 --> 3351.50]  I'm backwards.
[3351.78 --> 3351.98]  Yeah.
[3352.36 --> 3353.46]  Do you want to flip the laptops around?
[3353.52 --> 3354.04]  What the heck?
[3354.34 --> 3354.56]  No,
[3354.60 --> 3355.18]  I'm over it,
[3355.28 --> 3356.70]  But it feels weird.
[3356.98 --> 3357.32]  It does.
[3357.32 --> 3358.68]  The whole thing has felt really weird,
[3358.76 --> 3360.72]  And I've been trying to figure out what the heck is going on.
[3360.74 --> 3363.54]  We had so many discussions about what side are you guys sitting on.
[3363.58 --> 3363.68]  No,
[3363.74 --> 3364.18]  That's backwards.
[3364.42 --> 3364.58]  No,
[3364.58 --> 3365.50]  The lights go this side.
[3365.56 --> 3365.74]  No.
[3365.96 --> 3366.60]  How did the discussion?
[3366.60 --> 3367.40]  Linus should be driving.
[3367.74 --> 3368.28]  How did the discussion?
[3368.28 --> 3368.50]  Oh,
[3368.58 --> 3369.64]  Because Linus should be driving?
[3369.66 --> 3370.46]  Because Linus should be driving.
[3370.50 --> 3371.04]  Why would I be driving?
[3371.04 --> 3372.40]  Linus doesn't have a class three license.
[3372.54 --> 3374.02]  Linus should be sitting on the right.
[3374.90 --> 3375.68]  It doesn't matter if it's said.
[3375.68 --> 3377.36]  We should have got my brother to show up,
[3377.38 --> 3378.60]  And we should have done Wancho on the road,
[3378.88 --> 3379.74]  And just like driven around.
[3379.78 --> 3380.28]  Hold on,
[3380.32 --> 3381.26]  I can fix this.
[3381.34 --> 3381.50]  No.
[3382.14 --> 3382.46]  No,
[3382.52 --> 3382.64]  No,
[3382.64 --> 3382.78]  No,
[3382.78 --> 3382.90]  No,
[3382.90 --> 3383.00]  No,
[3383.00 --> 3383.28]  Don't,
[3383.32 --> 3383.54]  Don't,
[3383.54 --> 3383.72]  No,
[3383.80 --> 3383.90]  No,
[3383.90 --> 3384.44]  Don't do it.
[3385.24 --> 3385.60]  Anyway,
[3385.60 --> 3386.50]  The point is,
[3386.90 --> 3388.58]  The thirst extinguisher is,
[3388.76 --> 3389.48]  I think,
[3389.66 --> 3392.26]  The Crater Warehouse team absolutely outdid themselves here.
[3392.80 --> 3393.46]  Thirst tips.
[3393.76 --> 3394.50]  Hold bottle upright,
[3394.68 --> 3395.02]  Unscrew,
[3395.16 --> 3396.18]  And remove cap from spout.
[3396.58 --> 3398.18]  Lift to mouth and tilt slowly to drink.
[3398.46 --> 3400.40]  Drink until thirst is extinguished.
[3400.62 --> 3400.90]  Warning,
[3401.00 --> 3401.56]  Do not drop.
[3401.62 --> 3405.16]  This thing is so cool.
[3405.68 --> 3407.08]  I absolutely love it.
[3407.16 --> 3409.08]  I think they did an amazing job of it.
[3410.36 --> 3411.94]  Here's our maintenance records.
[3412.98 --> 3413.54]  Now,
[3413.54 --> 3422.20]  A lot of you seem a little confused about what the heck was the April Fool this year.
[3423.18 --> 3428.66]  The April Fool's joke is that there was no April Fool's joke this year.
[3429.42 --> 3432.08]  We did buy a fire truck.
[3432.66 --> 3434.98]  We are sitting in it right now.
[3434.98 --> 3435.46]  Yeah,
[3435.50 --> 3436.90]  It's not a green screen.
[3437.00 --> 3437.12]  Look,
[3437.18 --> 3438.40]  I can open the door.
[3438.52 --> 3441.86]  I wonder if I could grab Andrew's camera and do you a tour or something.
[3441.94 --> 3442.92]  We didn't rent it.
[3443.40 --> 3445.04]  We didn't fake anything.
[3446.00 --> 3452.16]  Absolutely everything you saw in the April Fool's video was real.
[3452.40 --> 3452.58]  So,
[3452.78 --> 3454.74]  The April Fool this year was,
[3455.28 --> 3457.80]  If you don't believe that this is real,
[3457.92 --> 3458.80]  Then you're an April Fool.
[3458.90 --> 3459.58]  We got you.
[3459.58 --> 3459.86]  Yeah.
[3460.18 --> 3464.68]  We were discussing before the show that the audio is actually surprisingly good in here.
[3464.96 --> 3465.06]  Oh,
[3465.10 --> 3465.40]  It's bad.
[3465.40 --> 3467.76]  It's like a relatively small and padded,
[3467.84 --> 3468.32]  like,
[3468.64 --> 3468.96]  Room.
[3469.56 --> 3471.54]  It's probably better than the WAN set.
[3471.70 --> 3474.14]  And we were discussing about which was cheaper.
[3474.14 --> 3477.74]  I think we should just use this for,
[3478.06 --> 3479.08]  And I don't know,
[3479.40 --> 3480.02]  Forever after.
[3480.18 --> 3480.30]  I mean,
[3480.42 --> 3481.42]  Just use it from now on.
[3481.44 --> 3483.84]  We maybe should have just bought a fire truck to begin with.
[3484.04 --> 3484.32]  Okay.
[3484.44 --> 3487.08]  You're going to have to hold your questions about the April Fool's video.
[3487.16 --> 3488.24]  I got a lot of people that are like,
[3488.56 --> 3488.92]  Whoa,
[3489.00 --> 3489.14]  Whoa,
[3489.16 --> 3489.30]  Whoa,
[3489.30 --> 3490.24]  This changes everything.
[3490.24 --> 3492.60]  Because they just assumed everything was fake.
[3492.68 --> 3492.86]  So,
[3492.92 --> 3493.26]  You're a fool.
[3493.50 --> 3493.78]  So,
[3494.06 --> 3494.24]  Yeah.
[3494.38 --> 3494.96]  Merch messages.
[3495.08 --> 3495.72]  Merch messages.
[3496.04 --> 3497.14]  Buy a thirst extinguisher.
[3498.02 --> 3498.36]  Dan,
[3498.44 --> 3498.88]  Do you want to,
[3499.16 --> 3499.42]  Oh,
[3499.48 --> 3499.60]  Yeah.
[3499.66 --> 3499.86]  Right.
[3499.98 --> 3500.94]  How to leave a merch message.
[3501.02 --> 3501.12]  So,
[3501.14 --> 3503.64]  You go on lttstore.com where we've got,
[3504.14 --> 3504.32]  Wait,
[3504.38 --> 3504.76]  What is this?
[3504.82 --> 3507.14]  Click here to call the LTT firewall department.
[3507.40 --> 3507.76]  Sorry,
[3507.82 --> 3508.28]  What is this?
[3509.16 --> 3511.08]  Click here to call the LTT firewall department.
[3511.24 --> 3511.36]  Oh.
[3511.98 --> 3512.26]  Guys,
[3512.42 --> 3512.60]  Okay.
[3512.74 --> 3513.32]  Top Gear said,
[3513.42 --> 3513.54]  No,
[3513.62 --> 3518.30]  The April Fool's that you guys never bothered to idle up the fire engine and use full pressure or flow through the nozzle.
[3518.48 --> 3519.80]  Please have Luke's brother show you how to do that.
[3520.08 --> 3523.24]  The point of that whole section was them just kind of like fumbling around.
[3523.26 --> 3523.70]  Having fun.
[3523.82 --> 3525.46]  I thought it was fun watching you guys do stuff.
[3525.46 --> 3525.56]  Yeah,
[3525.60 --> 3525.72]  Yeah,
[3525.72 --> 3525.82]  Yeah,
[3525.82 --> 3526.16]  Don't worry.
[3526.16 --> 3527.36]  I didn't expect you to do it perfectly.
[3527.50 --> 3528.66]  We're going to figure stuff out later.
[3528.72 --> 3528.88]  Yeah,
[3528.88 --> 3529.56]  Don't even trip,
[3529.60 --> 3529.72]  Dog.
[3529.72 --> 3530.14]  It's fine.
[3530.76 --> 3531.14]  Um,
[3531.22 --> 3531.50]  All right.
[3531.58 --> 3531.90]  So,
[3532.16 --> 3533.22]  Head to LTT store.
[3533.40 --> 3534.36]  Add something to your car.
[3534.48 --> 3534.68]  Say,
[3534.74 --> 3535.20]  For example,
[3535.38 --> 3536.40]  The commuter backpack.
[3536.92 --> 3538.24]  Whale of a surprise.
[3538.82 --> 3539.02]  Oh,
[3539.08 --> 3540.28]  There's something behind Luke,
[3540.38 --> 3540.88]  I believe.
[3540.94 --> 3541.58]  What is this?
[3541.82 --> 3542.28]  Have you,
[3542.36 --> 3542.64]  Uh,
[3542.64 --> 3543.90]  This weekend only.
[3544.12 --> 3544.94]  Offer ends Sunday,
[3545.04 --> 3546.92]  April 6th at 1159 p.m.
[3547.04 --> 3547.74]  Pacific time.
[3547.92 --> 3548.40]  He he he.
[3548.84 --> 3550.52]  There's a commuter backpack behind you,
[3550.56 --> 3550.68]  Luke.
[3550.82 --> 3551.04]  Oh,
[3551.04 --> 3551.56]  Okay.
[3553.26 --> 3554.06]  And you get,
[3554.16 --> 3554.54]  You get,
[3554.66 --> 3556.76]  Nobody consults me on our promos anymore.
[3557.10 --> 3558.22]  This is a pretty special promo.
[3558.30 --> 3558.80]  What is this?
[3558.82 --> 3559.14]  Okay,
[3559.28 --> 3560.12]  It's a commuter backpack,
[3560.28 --> 3560.36]  Luke.
[3560.40 --> 3560.56]  Yeah,
[3560.62 --> 3560.72]  Yeah,
[3560.72 --> 3562.02]  Wait,
[3562.14 --> 3562.32]  Do you,
[3562.44 --> 3564.02]  I believe,
[3564.32 --> 3564.58]  Oh,
[3565.80 --> 3567.84]  There's some one in three chances.
[3568.06 --> 3568.74]  It should be in,
[3568.82 --> 3569.04]  Uh,
[3569.26 --> 3569.88]  Should be in the doctor.
[3569.88 --> 3572.90]  So if you buy a commuter bag and a whale,
[3573.08 --> 3575.30]  Inside your backpack,
[3575.72 --> 3576.04]  Some,
[3576.36 --> 3577.34]  Will be either.
[3577.34 --> 3577.60]  Some,
[3578.06 --> 3578.64]  If you're lucky.
[3578.92 --> 3579.84]  Inside your backpack,
[3579.84 --> 3580.70]  Wait,
[3580.76 --> 3580.96]  But no,
[3581.02 --> 3581.84]  Cause you buy the whale,
[3582.26 --> 3582.52]  Right?
[3582.72 --> 3583.02]  Yes.
[3583.76 --> 3585.22]  I believe they're together.
[3585.36 --> 3586.28]  Is it not in the dock?
[3586.62 --> 3590.00]  Inside your backpack will be either a whale,
[3590.74 --> 3591.04]  Gotcha.
[3591.06 --> 3591.40]  Or,
[3591.68 --> 3595.02]  One of three signed fire trucks by me and Luke.
[3595.02 --> 3595.24]  Oh.
[3596.32 --> 3598.14]  There is a sharpie in the center there.
[3598.30 --> 3598.56]  Okay.
[3598.64 --> 3599.56]  For you guys to sign the fire trucks.
[3599.56 --> 3599.70]  Oh,
[3599.70 --> 3600.98]  All three of the fire trucks are there.
[3601.04 --> 3604.72]  So these are the ones that were in the silly unboxing at the beginning of the April Fool's video.
[3605.00 --> 3605.54]  Got it.
[3605.78 --> 3605.92]  Oh,
[3605.92 --> 3606.14]  Okay.
[3606.14 --> 3606.54]  So wait,
[3606.54 --> 3606.94]  Okay,
[3607.10 --> 3608.38]  So you buy the commuter pack,
[3608.46 --> 3609.22]  That's all you buy?
[3609.34 --> 3609.82]  And a whale.
[3610.24 --> 3611.02]  You buy the whale.
[3611.06 --> 3611.70]  You buy the whale.
[3612.42 --> 3612.56]  Okay.
[3612.56 --> 3613.42]  And you might get a whale.
[3614.18 --> 3614.42]  Uh,
[3614.42 --> 3615.96]  Or you might get a signed fire truck.
[3617.04 --> 3617.24]  Uh,
[3617.40 --> 3618.32]  Arthur's in here,
[3618.72 --> 3619.38]  So,
[3619.54 --> 3620.30]  Let's see what he says.
[3623.68 --> 3624.00]  Oh,
[3624.12 --> 3625.18]  You get the whale for free.
[3626.04 --> 3626.36]  Yeah,
[3626.44 --> 3626.56]  Like,
[3626.60 --> 3628.98]  Why would you buy the whale and then maybe get another whale?
[3629.20 --> 3629.38]  No,
[3629.42 --> 3629.50]  No,
[3629.50 --> 3630.50]  You don't maybe get another whale.
[3630.54 --> 3630.64]  Oh,
[3630.66 --> 3631.28]  For the love of God.
[3631.54 --> 3631.72]  Luke,
[3631.76 --> 3632.56]  You get the whale.
[3632.68 --> 3633.06]  The whale,
[3633.32 --> 3635.14]  And the whale will be in your backpack.
[3635.14 --> 3637.50]  Or,
[3637.78 --> 3638.50]  A fire truck.
[3639.06 --> 3641.74]  Because they're going to pack the whale you bought in the back.
[3641.82 --> 3642.04]  Anyway,
[3642.12 --> 3642.62]  The point is,
[3642.70 --> 3643.52]  It's free anyway.
[3643.94 --> 3645.02]  So you don't have to pay for it.
[3645.10 --> 3648.04]  You get the whale for free when you add both the commuter and the whale to your cart.
[3648.12 --> 3648.36]  Yes.
[3648.74 --> 3649.68]  So either way.
[3649.78 --> 3650.86]  So you guarantee you get the whale.
[3650.90 --> 3651.68]  You get a backpack.
[3652.86 --> 3653.06]  Then,
[3653.18 --> 3654.80]  Inside will be either a whale,
[3655.14 --> 3657.22]  Or one of three signed fire trucks.
[3657.60 --> 3659.78]  It would really help if I just read the doc for this.
[3659.78 --> 3660.92]  The point is,
[3661.02 --> 3661.28]  That's crazy.
[3661.40 --> 3661.66]  I don't know.
[3661.76 --> 3663.10]  Go to LTTstore.com.
[3663.18 --> 3664.14]  Find something cool.
[3664.48 --> 3665.28]  Add it to your cart.
[3665.42 --> 3669.84]  And there will be a box to leave a merch message.
[3669.98 --> 3671.00]  And it will go to producer Dan,
[3671.10 --> 3673.88]  Who we are revealing once and for all.
[3675.56 --> 3675.98]  Look at that.
[3676.10 --> 3678.12]  He's in the back of the fire truck.
[3678.16 --> 3678.68]  Let's go.
[3678.68 --> 3679.16]  On the top of it.
[3679.16 --> 3679.96]  Turn on the lights.
[3680.10 --> 3680.82]  Turn on the lights.
[3680.92 --> 3681.02]  Oh,
[3681.14 --> 3681.60]  I'll turn it off.
[3681.66 --> 3681.78]  Yeah.
[3681.82 --> 3683.80]  You have to climb up to where Dan is.
[3683.86 --> 3684.02]  Yeah,
[3684.04 --> 3684.88]  It's pretty high up,
[3684.94 --> 3685.24]  Actually.
[3685.42 --> 3686.34]  I got a light here.
[3686.42 --> 3687.44]  It's on the scissor lift.
[3687.44 --> 3688.34]  And yeah,
[3688.40 --> 3689.44]  This is pretty cool.
[3689.58 --> 3690.06]  There you go.
[3690.28 --> 3690.98]  Let's go.
[3692.20 --> 3693.02]  Real fire truck.
[3693.12 --> 3694.66]  Dan on the back of the fire truck.
[3694.88 --> 3695.54]  Let's go.
[3696.74 --> 3698.10]  We can leave these on for a little bit.
[3698.14 --> 3699.56]  As long as we're not on public roads,
[3699.62 --> 3701.48]  Apparently we are allowed to have the lights on.
[3701.48 --> 3703.20]  You're also not allowed to drain the battery,
[3703.38 --> 3704.10]  Or you will.
[3704.38 --> 3704.80]  Oh yeah,
[3704.84 --> 3706.02]  I'll face the wrath of Jamie.
[3706.26 --> 3706.58]  Yes.
[3706.94 --> 3707.72]  That makes sense.
[3708.02 --> 3708.38]  Absolutely.
[3708.70 --> 3710.20]  And I'm definitely not allowed to start the engine,
[3710.32 --> 3711.66]  Because we are very much indoors.
[3712.10 --> 3712.32]  Yeah.
[3712.44 --> 3713.42]  What about the horn?
[3714.90 --> 3715.32]  You can do it.
[3715.38 --> 3715.78]  You can do it.
[3715.96 --> 3716.40]  You ready, Dan?
[3716.40 --> 3717.68]  You should really plug your ears down.
[3718.14 --> 3719.52]  I'm going to do that.
[3719.52 --> 3720.18]  You got headphones on?
[3720.24 --> 3720.50]  Yeah.
[3720.66 --> 3720.86]  Oh yeah,
[3720.90 --> 3721.50]  You got headphones on.
[3721.56 --> 3721.70]  Okay,
[3721.76 --> 3722.28]  Everyone ready?
[3722.62 --> 3722.86]  Yeah.
[3728.54 --> 3729.94]  Oh my god.
[3731.48 --> 3732.00]  I mean,
[3732.06 --> 3732.54]  There's more.
[3733.06 --> 3733.48]  Oh god.
[3734.00 --> 3734.42]  Hold on.
[3734.60 --> 3735.16]  Where is it?
[3736.84 --> 3737.34]  Hold on,
[3737.38 --> 3737.70]  Hold on.
[3738.22 --> 3738.92]  It's over there.
[3739.02 --> 3739.14]  Okay,
[3739.24 --> 3740.62]  Luke's got the other thing.
[3741.00 --> 3741.32]  Dan,
[3741.42 --> 3741.52]  Yeah,
[3741.56 --> 3743.74]  You're really going to want your stuff covered for this.
[3743.74 --> 3743.78]  Oh god,
[3743.88 --> 3744.08]  Okay.
[3744.34 --> 3744.80]  Here we go.
[3744.80 --> 3746.30]  The knob on the left.
[3746.46 --> 3746.66]  All right,
[3746.70 --> 3746.82]  Yeah.
[3747.36 --> 3747.76]  Keep going.
[3747.76 --> 3747.80]  Keep going.
[3751.80 --> 3762.16]  Oh my good god.
[3764.74 --> 3766.10]  Real firetruck.
[3766.10 --> 3768.00]  For those of you wondering,
[3768.36 --> 3768.90]  Yes,
[3769.06 --> 3771.22]  It is street legal here.
[3771.62 --> 3772.04]  Yeah.
[3772.38 --> 3779.90]  The only thing we have to do is cover the emergency lights and not turn that on.
[3780.06 --> 3780.38]  Yeah,
[3780.50 --> 3782.06]  But it can be mounted.
[3782.28 --> 3783.92]  Is that wild or what?
[3783.96 --> 3784.82]  Just can't turn it on.
[3784.82 --> 3786.20]  That is flippant.
[3786.20 --> 3791.16]  I got to get my class three license if I want to drive it, which my understanding is actually
[3791.16 --> 3792.24]  a pretty short course.
[3792.62 --> 3800.20]  But other than that, it is a real fucking firetruck that we actually bought.
[3800.20 --> 3802.04]  And that's the April Fool.
[3802.04 --> 3804.12]  And absolutely none of it was fake.
[3804.30 --> 3806.64]  I sent my brother a video of it.
[3806.96 --> 3807.10]  Yeah.
[3807.10 --> 3809.24]  And he said it's like quite legit.
[3809.50 --> 3812.14]  Like the brand and all that type of stuff.
[3812.26 --> 3813.32]  Apparently it's like very good.
[3813.40 --> 3813.60]  Oh no,
[3813.68 --> 3815.10]  It's like it's a real firetruck.
[3815.22 --> 3816.54]  Not only is it real,
[3816.60 --> 3817.40]  It's a good one.
[3817.52 --> 3819.30]  It's only not in service today.
[3819.38 --> 3821.08]  It only has 30,000 kilometers on it.
[3821.12 --> 3821.32]  Yeah.
[3821.60 --> 3824.44]  That's just over 20,000 miles.
[3824.82 --> 3829.28]  Like the only reason it's not in service today is because it's so old.
[3829.62 --> 3831.42]  It aged out of active service.
[3831.54 --> 3833.56]  A lot of firetruck stuff is idle time.
[3834.08 --> 3834.92]  Not necessarily the mileage.
[3835.12 --> 3835.46]  Still.
[3835.70 --> 3835.94]  Yeah.
[3836.14 --> 3837.00]  That's still nothing.
[3837.18 --> 3840.64]  Like people were saying that typically retired ones will have 100 plus kilometers on it.
[3840.64 --> 3840.92]  Oh yeah.
[3840.92 --> 3842.10]  Because they do still drive.
[3842.20 --> 3842.54]  For sure.
[3842.84 --> 3844.12]  You answer a lot of calls and stuff.
[3844.34 --> 3844.54]  Yeah.
[3846.76 --> 3850.86]  We had a concept for the April Fool's that we would like pretend it was fake.
[3851.32 --> 3854.02]  Like we'd pretend we were trying to fake it.
[3854.12 --> 3859.32]  So everything would like be green screened until all of a sudden we like interact with the truck and people like no way.
[3859.64 --> 3861.04]  But then that ended up.
[3861.04 --> 3862.34]  Probably take too long to build up.
[3862.46 --> 3862.94]  It was too much work.
[3863.04 --> 3864.16]  I think the final video is really good.
[3864.22 --> 3865.38]  The final video was really good.
[3865.44 --> 3870.80]  My kids watched it last night and they like they and Yvonne like laughed multiple times.
[3870.96 --> 3871.36]  And yeah,
[3871.42 --> 3872.30]  it felt pretty good.
[3872.34 --> 3875.38]  There's been videos that like I've watched with my kids and I'm like,
[3875.38 --> 3875.50]  Oh,
[3875.54 --> 3876.66]  this is actually a boring video.
[3877.60 --> 3878.18]  But no,
[3878.32 --> 3880.14]  the April Fool's this year was outstanding.
[3880.28 --> 3880.42]  Sorry.
[3880.42 --> 3882.88]  We'll get to talking about it a little bit later.
[3883.02 --> 3883.46]  But first,
[3883.66 --> 3883.84]  Dan,
[3883.90 --> 3885.26]  you want to show us how merch messages work?
[3885.82 --> 3886.26]  Absolutely.
[3886.60 --> 3887.44]  They send them in the cart.
[3887.56 --> 3889.22]  They place their order and they go to producer Dan.
[3889.30 --> 3889.46]  Right.
[3889.58 --> 3889.76]  Right.
[3889.84 --> 3890.96]  And producer Dan is on fire.
[3891.10 --> 3891.98]  If you look carefully,
[3892.08 --> 3892.60]  you can see.
[3893.64 --> 3893.90]  Yeah.
[3893.90 --> 3895.70]  We have a fire light in the back.
[3896.88 --> 3897.78]  So extra.
[3898.00 --> 3898.58]  I love it.
[3898.68 --> 3901.08]  Got a couple of questions here about the April Fool's merch.
[3901.26 --> 3902.60]  Question for the Peepers.
[3902.60 --> 3908.92]  Were there any legal concerns regarding the water bottle given its similarity to emergency safety devices?
[3909.20 --> 3909.42]  No.
[3911.42 --> 3912.96]  Things can be red and white.
[3912.96 --> 3913.96]  I am.
[3913.96 --> 3915.42]  I am.
[3915.42 --> 3916.42]  I am.
[3916.42 --> 3916.66]  I am.
[3916.66 --> 3924.98]  I am not always a person who has the most faith in humans to be not stupid.
[3925.98 --> 3927.64]  Is a way I would put it.
[3928.38 --> 3937.88]  I sincerely do not know any single living, breathing human being in my life that would mistake that for an actual fire extinguisher.
[3937.98 --> 3939.36]  I think we're going to be okay, everyone.
[3941.56 --> 3941.96]  Hopefully.
[3942.82 --> 3944.56]  And I got a second one here about that.
[3945.04 --> 3949.36]  Hey, LMG Foolies, the 2026 calendar truly surprised me.
[3949.80 --> 3954.74]  What's been your favorite project over the years and what's the most embarrassing thing you've done for a project?
[3955.40 --> 3956.24]  Oh, my goodness.
[3956.24 --> 3962.48]  I mean, there's definitely stuff that didn't feel that embarrassing back when we did it.
[3964.06 --> 3965.82]  But it's like pretty embarrassing now.
[3966.10 --> 3967.42]  Oh, definitely.
[3967.88 --> 3968.84]  Channel Superfunds.
[3968.84 --> 3983.66]  Like, dude, this Computex trip was brutal because I was desperately trying to figure out how to get anybody to watch any of this content that WD sponsored.
[3984.22 --> 3986.26]  And nothing against Western Digital.
[3986.38 --> 3987.32]  They make good products.
[3987.44 --> 3990.68]  They seem like a pretty stand-up company.
[3990.68 --> 4004.48]  But the only way that we could cover the costs to go to Computex that first year was to do a video on the show floor in WD's booth every day of the show.
[4004.48 --> 4013.98]  So we were desperately trying to find a way to make one booth interesting over and over and over again.
[4013.98 --> 4027.00]  And when we announced that we were going to Computex, we did this unhinged nonsense that I was just trying to do anything that I could to figure out how I could have the retention not be absolutely trash.
[4027.00 --> 4028.64]  I'm playing with cars.
[4028.64 --> 4029.58]  What am I doing?
[4030.86 --> 4032.16]  Is that an axe on the ground?
[4032.56 --> 4036.66]  I'm a grown man wearing a dress and a Superman cape, and I'm playing with cars.
[4036.78 --> 4038.10]  And I think there's an axe on the ground.
[4038.10 --> 4039.02]  What was I thinking?
[4041.16 --> 4042.94]  I made some kind of promise.
[4042.94 --> 4044.58]  Don't you go in the shower in this video?
[4045.24 --> 4046.82]  And I was like, we'll do stuff.
[4046.90 --> 4049.28]  When you watch the videos, you can unlock more prizes.
[4049.42 --> 4049.58]  Right.
[4049.58 --> 4055.12]  That was WD's idea, was the more views we got or something, because I told them we're not going to get any views on this.
[4055.44 --> 4056.72]  I was like, I need to turn this off.
[4057.00 --> 4065.46]  I was like, the more views that we get, the more prizes that we'll do for your audience or something like that.
[4065.46 --> 4068.04]  I was like, oh, my God, that's not going to work at all.
[4068.32 --> 4068.42]  No.
[4068.96 --> 4070.26]  That's like actually stupid.
[4070.26 --> 4076.68]  But look, never say that I'm not committed.
[4077.42 --> 4078.94]  So here were the giveaways.
[4078.94 --> 4080.74]  I think the videos were, yeah, you got in the shower.
[4080.90 --> 4081.36]  Yeah, I remember this.
[4081.36 --> 4083.56]  I'm in the shower with an axe and a Superman suit.
[4083.62 --> 4085.08]  What is even happening right now?
[4085.12 --> 4085.60]  I don't know.
[4085.92 --> 4086.96]  The videos were better back then.
[4087.12 --> 4088.26]  Yeah, they sure were.
[4088.38 --> 4089.64]  There's more production quality.
[4089.88 --> 4090.56]  Oh, definitely.
[4090.92 --> 4091.38]  And writing.
[4093.86 --> 4094.22]  Yeah.
[4096.66 --> 4104.60]  Yeah, that, if I was to ever go back and just like purge weird stuff that I've done over the years, that would be one of the videos.
[4106.22 --> 4107.28]  That would be one of them.
[4108.94 --> 4109.34]  Yes.
[4111.04 --> 4111.44]  Wow.
[4111.90 --> 4112.72]  This, wow.
[4113.08 --> 4115.02]  This is terrible.
[4115.64 --> 4115.86]  Cool.
[4116.12 --> 4117.10]  You derailed them too hard.
[4117.18 --> 4117.54]  Next one.
[4117.64 --> 4117.82]  Yeah.
[4119.36 --> 4120.28]  Yeah, one more, Dan.
[4121.14 --> 4121.76]  All right.
[4121.86 --> 4123.60]  Let's see what else we got here.
[4123.84 --> 4124.98]  Let's go back to the top.
[4124.98 --> 4126.72]  Hey, LDL.
[4126.80 --> 4133.26]  This past Valentine's Day, my partner surprised me with both a spicy outfit and a scribe driver pen tucked in her hair.
[4133.64 --> 4137.34]  What is the nerdiest romantic thing that you or your partner has done?
[4137.34 --> 4139.02]  I got one.
[4139.66 --> 4140.06]  Sure.
[4140.52 --> 4153.40]  For Christmas a few years ago, Emma, my partner, got me a, like, clearly from like Value Village or something, leather satchel bag thing.
[4153.40 --> 4155.14]  And it was completely full.
[4155.14 --> 4165.40]  And when I opened it, it was the, it was what you might expect a Pokemon professor would have in a leather satchel bag.
[4165.40 --> 4165.88]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[4165.88 --> 4171.44]  So there was like little samples, like from, from like, you know, I don't know, different Pokemon stuff.
[4171.78 --> 4172.38]  Bulbasaur leaf.
[4172.46 --> 4179.66]  There was, yeah, there was a book with like notes that she wrote that like mimic like the types of things that might be in there.
[4179.86 --> 4180.18]  That's true.
[4180.18 --> 4183.68]  There was, there was like all this different type of stuff and it was a full actual kit.
[4183.76 --> 4184.60]  It was super, super cool.
[4184.66 --> 4185.22]  I still have it.
[4186.04 --> 4195.20]  The, I'd say, I'd say like one of the, you know, moment I knew moments with Yvonne was, actually, no,
[4195.20 --> 4196.16]  I'm going to go with a different one.
[4196.20 --> 4202.08]  I'm going to go with when Yvonne bought me an air conditioner, a window mounted air conditioner unit for my birthday.
[4203.58 --> 4210.88]  Knowing that I was going to immediately disassemble it and use it to submersion, sub-zero cool.
[4210.88 --> 4221.26]  So I was going to submerse the evaporator side into a windshield de-icer and then pump the fluid around to my CPU so that I could go sub-zero 24-7.
[4221.26 --> 4228.02]  And that, that, I mean, how can you not know that she's the one in that moment?
[4230.34 --> 4232.62]  KG4 WWN in float plane chat says,
[4232.62 --> 4241.68]  it's kind of ironic to decry weirdness and childishnessness of, childishness of prior videos while sitting in the fire truck you bought.
[4243.02 --> 4243.50]  Look.
[4244.24 --> 4245.38]  Different, different level.
[4245.58 --> 4245.88]  Yeah.
[4246.18 --> 4246.58]  Yeah.
[4247.14 --> 4249.82]  We're childish on a completely different level now.
[4249.92 --> 4250.18]  Yeah.
[4250.40 --> 4250.68]  Yeah.
[4251.28 --> 4253.44]  We can afford way better childish toys.
[4253.44 --> 4257.78]  I actually am going to un one of the toys that I bought.
[4257.94 --> 4260.84]  I am actually dying in this jacket.
[4260.84 --> 4260.94]  Yeah.
[4260.98 --> 4264.66]  Those aren't, uh, those aren't known for their cooling properties.
[4265.06 --> 4265.50]  Nope.
[4266.64 --> 4267.40]  I'll be right back.
[4267.62 --> 4267.82]  Yeah.
[4267.86 --> 4268.46]  Sounds good.
[4269.24 --> 4271.04]  Um, next topic.
[4271.18 --> 4273.24]  Do we talk about the fire truck?
[4273.30 --> 4274.52]  Do we fully go through this?
[4274.56 --> 4275.70]  Yeah, let's do it.
[4275.90 --> 4277.40]  Uh, fire truck.
[4277.40 --> 4278.30]  April fools.
[4278.42 --> 4279.10]  Except not really.
[4279.22 --> 4280.68]  We really bought a real fire truck for real.
[4280.88 --> 4281.00]  Wow.
[4281.08 --> 4283.10]  What a, what a, that is the sentence.
[4283.10 --> 4289.10]  Uh, while it was definitely less work and money than the Langley house video last year, really
[4289.10 --> 4289.66]  it was less money.
[4289.76 --> 4290.00]  Interesting.
[4290.46 --> 4291.04]  Oh, easy.
[4291.30 --> 4293.80]  Getting this whole project figured out was still a pain.
[4293.92 --> 4295.06]  Figuring out transport.
[4295.34 --> 4297.46]  Uh, we couldn't drive it until inspections.
[4298.16 --> 4299.04]  Uh, yeah.
[4299.42 --> 4301.00]  So we had to haul it back here.
[4301.10 --> 4304.68]  Uh, there's actually a really good float plane exclusive that you guys can check out.
[4305.10 --> 4307.52]  Um, lmg.gg slash float plane.
[4308.20 --> 4310.52]  Um, it's a great exclusive actually.
[4310.72 --> 4310.86]  Yeah.
[4311.04 --> 4312.44]  Um, also insurance.
[4312.44 --> 4313.44]  The person who was selling it.
[4313.68 --> 4315.34]  Insurance, which we don't have yet.
[4315.80 --> 4316.24]  Uh, yeah.
[4316.24 --> 4319.94]  That's why it just sits in the warehouse for now or in the parking lot.
[4320.50 --> 4321.88]  And permits for the hydrant.
[4322.04 --> 4323.64]  Those all took a long time to figure out.
[4323.76 --> 4328.34]  Shout out to Dylan for the hard work, especially driving all the way up there in like ridiculous
[4328.34 --> 4328.76]  cold.
[4328.84 --> 4330.56]  Again, it's a great, it's a great exclusive.
[4330.56 --> 4335.22]  Um, we got lucky when the fire inspector came by so we could pick his brain.
[4335.46 --> 4339.62]  Originally we wanted to use a city hydrant, but we would have needed permits for both
[4339.62 --> 4343.76]  the, the hydrant and just for filming, even though we're on our own property.
[4343.76 --> 4347.96]  Um, apparently the dead bird was a hundred percent real and not scripted.
[4348.44 --> 4357.62]  Uh, we, Oh dude, that was, uh, that was, that was, I, uh, I think, yeah, I think it's in the final edit.
[4357.70 --> 4360.82]  I, I am not, I'm not going to shy away from that.
[4360.86 --> 4362.74]  I have a necrophobia thing.
[4362.74 --> 4365.96]  I don't, I don't even think that's an embarrassing thing to admit.
[4366.28 --> 4368.96]  Like if it was necrophilia, that's pretty embarrassing.
[4369.42 --> 4369.54]  Yeah.
[4370.00 --> 4370.36]  Necrophobia.
[4370.72 --> 4372.16]  I don't think that's that embarrassing.
[4372.28 --> 4373.60]  I do not like dead things.
[4373.66 --> 4374.46]  I'm not into it.
[4374.92 --> 4375.72]  I don't think they're cool.
[4375.80 --> 4376.54]  I don't like touching them.
[4376.58 --> 4377.52]  I don't like looking at them.
[4377.58 --> 4378.26]  I'm not into it.
[4378.26 --> 4383.70]  Again, that's like one of my most traumatic childhood experiences was when I had to bury
[4383.70 --> 4386.10]  a fawn that my dog killed.
[4386.56 --> 4389.18]  Like I was not, I was not into that.
[4389.44 --> 4389.68]  Yeah.
[4389.74 --> 4390.42]  Not even a little.
[4390.42 --> 4390.98]  Fair enough.
[4390.98 --> 4395.40]  Um, some people, it doesn't bother them and that I'm not, I'm not judging or anything.
[4395.46 --> 4396.88]  I'm not saying everyone should be the same way.
[4396.90 --> 4398.70]  I'm just saying I'm not into it.
[4398.94 --> 4404.74]  So when I encounter, you know, unexpected mummified squirrel when I'm crawling around
[4404.74 --> 4411.54]  in my attic, when I encounter unexpected tailpipe dead bird, when I am poking around at my new
[4411.54 --> 4413.68]  fire truck, I'm not into it.
[4413.86 --> 4414.06]  Yeah.
[4414.38 --> 4416.24]  Um, yes, that was very real.
[4416.24 --> 4422.62]  Uh, apparently we almost got used fire gear for Linus, but apparently that is a cancer
[4422.62 --> 4423.00]  risk.
[4423.10 --> 4423.38]  Yes.
[4423.84 --> 4425.26]  Because they're chock full of carcinogens.
[4425.30 --> 4426.12]  So what is that then?
[4426.18 --> 4426.74]  Because they've been in fires.
[4427.18 --> 4428.46]  Uh, maybe it's less used.
[4428.50 --> 4428.82]  I don't know.
[4428.94 --> 4429.78]  It seems pretty used.
[4429.86 --> 4430.66]  It seems pretty used.
[4431.52 --> 4431.98]  I...
[4431.98 --> 4432.96]  Do you just get over it?
[4433.34 --> 4433.86]  I don't know.
[4434.42 --> 4435.34]  Because it seems pretty used.
[4435.34 --> 4436.66]  I just put on whatever they handed me.
[4436.84 --> 4437.70]  So maybe they killed me.
[4437.92 --> 4439.40]  The helmet seems pretty used.
[4439.52 --> 4442.22]  Oh, the helmet's definitely used, but I'd be less worried about a helmet absorbing
[4442.22 --> 4442.66]  carcinogens.
[4442.66 --> 4442.96]  Yeah.
[4443.44 --> 4443.66]  Yeah.
[4444.40 --> 4447.48]  Uh, anyways, uh, truck specs.
[4447.60 --> 4452.88]  It's a 1993 hub pumper with some HME parts and an 8.3 Cummings, uh, diesel engine.
[4453.00 --> 4454.10]  Get that G out of there.
[4454.16 --> 4455.12]  Who's memeing on this?
[4455.58 --> 4456.82]  David said Cummings.
[4457.10 --> 4457.40]  I know.
[4457.46 --> 4458.18]  In the video.
[4458.38 --> 4459.60]  It's just about died.
[4460.44 --> 4463.08]  Look, he is an expert on lots of things.
[4463.92 --> 4465.86]  Diesel engines, apparently not one of them.
[4466.00 --> 4466.38]  That's fine.
[4466.88 --> 4468.76]  I tried to continue it, but yeah, it's Cummings.
[4468.76 --> 4473.82]  Um, small t-shirts and thirst quenchers are still available on lttstore.com.
[4473.98 --> 4475.50]  All the other ones sold out.
[4475.98 --> 4476.52]  I'm sorry.
[4476.62 --> 4477.16]  I'm sorry.
[4477.16 --> 4480.54]  I was going to buy shirts for my brother's whole fire hall, and I couldn't.
[4481.22 --> 4481.66]  Look.
[4482.16 --> 4483.76]  I can't even buy our own products.
[4483.90 --> 4484.98]  What do you want from me?
[4485.20 --> 4485.90]  I'm sorry that...
[4485.90 --> 4487.06]  And I tried to do it quickly.
[4487.22 --> 4489.06]  I checked on April 1st.
[4489.14 --> 4493.60]  I'm sorry that our graphics design team, okay, is too talented.
[4494.08 --> 4494.34]  Yeah.
[4494.44 --> 4495.98]  And that the stuff they make sells too well.
[4495.98 --> 4496.98]  Maybe they should calm down.
[4497.36 --> 4498.16]  Maybe they should relax.
[4498.16 --> 4499.88]  I'm sorry it sells too well.
[4500.16 --> 4500.42]  Yeah.
[4501.10 --> 4501.74]  I'm sorry.
[4501.90 --> 4502.96]  Maybe they should do worse jobs.
[4503.32 --> 4503.56]  Yeah.
[4505.66 --> 4506.46]  Um...
[4506.46 --> 4515.40]  Oh, if you want some more trucking fire content, check out Floatplane, where we had three exclusives
[4515.40 --> 4515.96]  this week.
[4515.96 --> 4516.36]  Yeah.
[4516.36 --> 4519.50]  We have the driving up to get it, which is actually really interesting.
[4519.50 --> 4523.46]  And then there's some of the, like, writer's meetings, which were kind of cool.
[4523.50 --> 4526.58]  If you want to see some behind the scenes on, like, how video ideation happens.
[4526.74 --> 4527.54]  Getting the fire truck.
[4527.54 --> 4527.98]  Oh, yeah.
[4528.36 --> 4528.72]  Yeah.
[4528.72 --> 4529.36]  That's pretty cool.
[4529.36 --> 4533.90]  You actually get to, like, sit in writer's meeting while we talk about how we talk about
[4533.90 --> 4534.82]  things in writer's meeting.
[4535.16 --> 4536.80]  I haven't seen this yet.
[4537.12 --> 4541.56]  How much of this photo shoot ended up in the thing?
[4541.82 --> 4542.26]  Oh.
[4543.42 --> 4543.94]  Okay.
[4544.36 --> 4544.82]  Okay.
[4544.88 --> 4545.94]  We've got Sammy doing burpees.
[4546.06 --> 4548.56]  What is he, like, trying to get in shape for the shoot?
[4548.96 --> 4549.56]  I don't know.
[4551.64 --> 4552.04]  Yeah.
[4555.36 --> 4558.12]  I felt so awkward during this.
[4558.16 --> 4558.88]  You can tell.
[4559.30 --> 4559.64]  Yeah.
[4559.74 --> 4561.04]  Like, 100%.
[4561.04 --> 4561.40]  Yeah.
[4561.60 --> 4563.60]  That is exactly how awkward I felt.
[4563.60 --> 4563.74]  Yeah.
[4563.74 --> 4564.98]  There was zero acting.
[4572.50 --> 4572.86]  Yeah.
[4572.86 --> 4572.94]  Yeah.
[4572.94 --> 4575.34]  Man, I was sitting in labs when you guys were doing that.
[4575.34 --> 4577.46]  I didn't realize that was actually a calendar shoot.
[4577.82 --> 4580.96]  I thought you guys were just trying to get, like, B-roll and just took forever with it.
[4582.68 --> 4587.50]  Bartland says, my wife was actually angry you made something so very me.
[4587.74 --> 4591.12]  I'm an IT guy of 20-plus years and a retired firefighter.
[4591.92 --> 4592.36]  Yeah.
[4592.98 --> 4594.74]  That's the demographic we're going for.
[4594.74 --> 4596.16]  Hopefully you even got it.
[4597.40 --> 4598.32]  What else we got?
[4598.50 --> 4599.22]  Oh, my goodness.
[4599.30 --> 4600.52]  There's so many exclusives.
[4600.84 --> 4604.40]  20-plus minute vlog of getting the truck, short but informative seven-minute writer's meeting,
[4604.40 --> 4608.56]  and a 70-plus minute behind the scenes of the entire shoot.
[4609.20 --> 4611.14]  Everything from the full short circuit clip.
[4611.22 --> 4611.46]  Oh, yeah.
[4611.50 --> 4612.96]  The fake unboxing of the fire truck.
[4613.04 --> 4614.14]  Oh, I didn't think they were going to use that.
[4614.70 --> 4616.20]  To Linus's pants getting stolen.
[4616.50 --> 4618.66]  To all the alternative takes for the skip bits.
[4619.62 --> 4622.24]  Most, if not everything we just talked about is in the video.
[4622.32 --> 4626.10]  And, yes, even the bird and the spark, which happened minutes between each other, those are in there.
[4626.10 --> 4628.12]  So, I've had a few people asking.
[4628.38 --> 4630.38]  I think the first one to ask in float plane chat.
[4630.56 --> 4631.46]  Nope, I don't see it.
[4632.36 --> 4633.32]  I had notes.
[4633.40 --> 4634.08]  I didn't put it in there.
[4634.42 --> 4636.18]  Was the spark real and candid?
[4636.90 --> 4640.68]  The spark was 100% real and 100% candid.
[4641.00 --> 4641.66]  What spark?
[4643.52 --> 4648.46]  I pick up the thing, and I'm like, oh, gee, I wonder what this thing's for.
[4648.54 --> 4649.88]  Better connect the thing to the thing.
[4650.66 --> 4651.20]  Oh, yeah.
[4651.54 --> 4652.12]  Yeah.
[4652.12 --> 4654.68]  You guys saw we faked that?
[4654.94 --> 4655.14]  Yeah.
[4655.22 --> 4663.24]  I took the lead, and I just, like, touched it to the head of a bolt, and it was 600 volt DC.
[4663.80 --> 4663.98]  Yeah.
[4664.50 --> 4667.06]  I did not know that that was a thing.
[4667.18 --> 4668.44]  Nobody told me that was a thing.
[4668.52 --> 4673.92]  That is probably the closest I have come to being grievously harmed on set.
[4673.98 --> 4674.94]  I suggested...
[4674.94 --> 4675.64]  In a long time.
[4675.64 --> 4681.70]  At a minimum, 10 to 15 times that we involve my brother with this project in some way.
[4681.70 --> 4682.94]  Yeah, but that would have been less fun.
[4682.94 --> 4685.28]  To drive the truck, to help inform whatever.
[4685.50 --> 4686.06]  No, it would have been less fun.
[4686.06 --> 4687.70]  And I think there was...
[4688.30 --> 4694.04]  Like, you and David trying to explore, like, how truck work was genuinely really entertaining
[4694.04 --> 4694.44]  to watch.
[4694.56 --> 4695.66]  So I think it worked out.
[4695.72 --> 4695.98]  Oh, yeah.
[4696.34 --> 4696.60]  Oh, yeah.
[4696.64 --> 4697.26]  I had no doubt.
[4697.26 --> 4698.08]  I had no doubt.
[4698.20 --> 4698.80]  I'm just saying.
[4699.20 --> 4700.44]  Dude, I had no doubt.
[4700.64 --> 4702.78]  Because there's been people that chat like, where was Luke's brother?
[4702.90 --> 4704.58]  I'm like, he could have been here.
[4704.66 --> 4706.44]  I'm sure we'll chat with him at some point about it.
[4706.46 --> 4706.78]  Yeah, probably.
[4706.78 --> 4708.18]  Like, this is my fire truck now.
[4708.18 --> 4709.98]  There's no time pressure.
[4710.26 --> 4710.62]  Yeah.
[4710.86 --> 4712.04]  He owns it.
[4712.28 --> 4712.52]  Yeah.
[4712.62 --> 4715.42]  So if we want a cool PC with it, or we want to...
[4715.42 --> 4716.58]  Guys, feel free.
[4716.82 --> 4718.28]  That would be another good thing for merch messages.
[4718.28 --> 4718.66]  I really...
[4718.66 --> 4722.80]  Dan, if you want to filter merch messages that have, like, legitimately good ideas for
[4722.80 --> 4725.58]  fire truck videos, I send those over to David or something.
[4725.72 --> 4726.42]  Like, we're looking...
[4726.42 --> 4727.86]  We're open to ideas here, guys.
[4727.88 --> 4728.66]  We got a fire truck.
[4728.82 --> 4729.22]  So...
[4729.22 --> 4730.10]  Permanent Wandset.
[4730.10 --> 4736.56]  I want Alex to try to come up with some automatic anti-fire protection system for a computer.
[4737.08 --> 4737.70]  And I want you guys to put it...
[4737.70 --> 4739.98]  Well, you don't put out electrical fires with water, but okay.
[4742.22 --> 4744.56]  It doesn't have to be the computer that's on fire.
[4744.64 --> 4745.02]  Oh, sure.
[4745.18 --> 4745.36]  Yeah.
[4745.48 --> 4745.68]  Okay.
[4745.74 --> 4752.66]  So then my idea is that we go to the training field, and we actually light a mini house on
[4752.66 --> 4752.96]  fire.
[4753.70 --> 4758.80]  And you have to put the fire out with the fire truck, and then go see if Alex's creation
[4758.80 --> 4759.28]  survived.
[4759.28 --> 4759.92]  That's...
[4759.92 --> 4760.64]  I want that to happen.
[4760.64 --> 4764.20]  We are working on an AI turret for an unrelated project.
[4764.98 --> 4766.82]  So we could buy the turret.
[4767.06 --> 4768.26]  Apparently, it's a couple grand.
[4768.96 --> 4771.54]  And then we could, like, computer control the fire turret.
[4771.92 --> 4772.74]  Try to put out a fire.
[4772.84 --> 4773.32]  Oh, yeah?
[4773.48 --> 4777.10]  AI's coming for, like, software developers and writers and artists and stuff?
[4777.18 --> 4778.36]  What about firefighters?
[4779.14 --> 4782.88]  Do you want your life in the hands of an AI program?
[4782.90 --> 4783.48]  Oh, my God.
[4783.54 --> 4784.24]  We should put...
[4784.24 --> 4788.38]  Before we light the house on fire, we should put some mannequins in the windows and stuff.
[4789.28 --> 4793.66]  Just, like, put some streaming cameras in there, like, some low-cost streaming cameras.
[4793.66 --> 4794.72]  Just watch them get decked by the fire.
[4794.72 --> 4798.90]  And just, like, watch them get, like, absolutely obliterated, get their, like, heads knocked
[4798.90 --> 4800.00]  off by the fire hose.
[4800.20 --> 4805.10]  Get one of those, like, Boston Dynamics dogs to just, like, bite and haul out the thing
[4805.10 --> 4806.38]  and drag it along the ground.
[4806.54 --> 4807.16]  Oh, my goodness.
[4807.16 --> 4808.52]  Because nobody's there to carry them out.
[4809.72 --> 4810.54]  Ah, amazing.
[4812.06 --> 4814.42]  So, yeah, let us know if you have any good ideas, guys.
[4814.42 --> 4815.42]  Um...
[4815.42 --> 4816.96]  I really...
[4816.96 --> 4821.76]  I'm trying to find any way to shoehorn lighting a small house on fire and having you guys
[4821.76 --> 4822.26]  put it out.
[4822.70 --> 4827.52]  That's why I came up with the, like, Alex builds some fire self-defense system for a
[4827.52 --> 4827.84]  computer.
[4828.30 --> 4829.36]  I will consider it.
[4829.38 --> 4833.80]  It might be too challenging getting, like, servos that are big enough to move a firefighting
[4833.80 --> 4833.96]  turret.
[4834.02 --> 4834.50]  I don't know.
[4834.98 --> 4838.82]  But, anyway, our discussion questions here are, did you have fun making the video?
[4839.14 --> 4839.50]  Absolutely.
[4839.50 --> 4840.42]  It was a blast.
[4840.96 --> 4841.24]  Uh...
[4841.24 --> 4845.82]  The intro for today's WAN show was an absolute blast to make, even though I didn't know about
[4845.82 --> 4847.56]  it until I watched it right before we started.
[4847.90 --> 4850.26]  If you look carefully, um...
[4850.26 --> 4851.26]  It's just...
[4851.26 --> 4857.46]  My parts of it are just spliced together with new stuff from Luke from the April Fool's video.
[4857.66 --> 4862.54]  And there's one shot that has both of us in it that they apparently used a body double
[4862.54 --> 4862.84]  for.
[4862.94 --> 4865.46]  Nobody, like, asked me if I wanted to do it.
[4865.62 --> 4866.46]  They just did it without me.
[4866.46 --> 4867.36]  You weren't here when we were doing it.
[4867.40 --> 4867.86]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4867.86 --> 4868.26]  That's fine.
[4868.26 --> 4869.06]  I don't know where you were, but, yeah.
[4869.06 --> 4870.90]  Um, and our other discussion question...
[4870.90 --> 4872.08]  Yeah, we used, uh, Thomas.
[4873.04 --> 4873.34]  Yeah.
[4873.84 --> 4875.08]  Uh, did you have fun making the video?
[4875.20 --> 4879.68]  And David, who worked on our April Fool's again, an absolute rock star.
[4879.98 --> 4882.10]  He's, like, the king of April Fool's at this point.
[4882.12 --> 4883.08]  Dude, he killed it last year.
[4883.14 --> 4883.68]  He killed it this year.
[4883.68 --> 4887.70]  Yeah, I had fun, but I need 364 days before I'm ready to make another one.
[4888.26 --> 4889.76]  This is a joke, but not really.
[4889.82 --> 4890.68]  I'm so tired.
[4892.80 --> 4895.20]  Artie apparently has a merch message update down below.
[4895.98 --> 4896.20]  Huh?
[4896.84 --> 4897.44]  Uh...
[4897.44 --> 4899.08]  Where is it?
[4899.94 --> 4900.58]  In the middle?
[4900.94 --> 4902.48]  How am I supposed to know what the update is?
[4902.48 --> 4904.20]  Can you please sign the firetrucks live?
[4904.50 --> 4905.20]  Already messed up.
[4905.30 --> 4906.44]  Discount codes...
[4907.02 --> 4907.28]  Oh.
[4907.28 --> 4908.04]  Initially...
[4908.04 --> 4908.90]  Automatically...
[4908.90 --> 4913.62]  Oh, the discount codes weren't applying, but we will resolve any carts where the whales
[4913.62 --> 4914.78]  were added at full price.
[4915.02 --> 4915.16]  Okay.
[4915.16 --> 4915.88]  So don't worry about it.
[4915.92 --> 4916.12]  We got you.
[4916.12 --> 4917.04]  But where's the...
[4917.04 --> 4918.36]  I don't see the Sharpie, though.
[4918.36 --> 4920.36]  Uh...
[4920.36 --> 4925.36]  Just in front of the...
[4925.36 --> 4925.82]  Oh, I see it.
[4926.04 --> 4926.56]  Okay, cool.
[4927.68 --> 4928.88]  And where are all the trucks?
[4928.96 --> 4929.90]  I know one of them is in this room.
[4929.92 --> 4930.70]  I think they're all behind you.
[4930.78 --> 4931.24]  Behind you, yeah.
[4931.24 --> 4932.16]  Super ergonomic.
[4932.58 --> 4935.58]  There are definitely disadvantages to this set.
[4936.36 --> 4938.68]  It's not a flawless system.
[4939.56 --> 4940.32]  Dan should be...
[4940.32 --> 4941.16]  Oh my goodness, okay.
[4941.30 --> 4943.08]  Yeah, it's like right behind you.
[4943.18 --> 4945.00]  You know how you've been working on your shoulder flexibility?
[4945.30 --> 4945.54]  Yeah.
[4945.66 --> 4946.98]  Well, we're putting that to the test.
[4946.98 --> 4948.16]  I can climb down.
[4949.04 --> 4949.78]  Oh my gosh.
[4949.80 --> 4950.00]  No, don't do that.
[4950.00 --> 4951.00]  It's very easy.
[4951.12 --> 4952.72]  I don't think that would be best.
[4952.96 --> 4953.50]  Don't do that.
[4953.62 --> 4953.96]  Okay.
[4953.96 --> 4955.94]  Where should we sign these things?
[4956.00 --> 4957.82]  We've got to sign our fire trucks here.
[4958.06 --> 4958.82]  Fire rescue.
[4959.48 --> 4959.72]  Okay.
[4959.80 --> 4960.76]  Well, first things first.
[4960.88 --> 4961.54]  Engine one.
[4961.62 --> 4962.46]  You've got to be kidding me.
[4962.60 --> 4964.36]  It's a completely different engine here.
[4965.12 --> 4965.48]  Okay.
[4966.88 --> 4967.28]  Okay.
[4967.46 --> 4968.12]  And then...
[4968.12 --> 4968.54]  Yeah, sure.
[4968.66 --> 4969.92]  I'll sign it here.
[4970.08 --> 4971.20]  Are you going to number them all?
[4971.24 --> 4972.96]  Because they're all engine one.
[4972.96 --> 4976.28]  So you're going to make them engine one, two, three to serialize them?
[4976.28 --> 4977.78]  I think that's pretty smart.
[4977.90 --> 4979.88]  That was not the direction that I went with it.
[4979.98 --> 4980.40]  All right.
[4981.44 --> 4982.26]  What did you do?
[4982.34 --> 4983.08]  Where did you even go?
[4984.22 --> 4984.46]  Oh.
[4984.90 --> 4985.26]  Nice!
[4987.56 --> 4988.26]  That's legit.
[4990.30 --> 4990.90]  All right.
[4991.10 --> 4993.02]  Are you serializing them now or should I do it?
[4993.50 --> 4993.86]  Yeah.
[4994.02 --> 4995.00]  No, I'm serializing them.
[4995.08 --> 4995.46]  I got you.
[4995.50 --> 4995.96]  I got you.
[4995.96 --> 4998.32]  So we got engine 69.
[4999.76 --> 5002.02]  Engine 169.
[5003.36 --> 5006.00]  Engine 269.
[5006.12 --> 5006.38]  Okay.
[5007.44 --> 5011.56]  And there's a chance that these will be in your order of the commuter bag, which includes
[5011.56 --> 5012.46]  a free whale plushie.
[5013.54 --> 5014.52]  Oh, right, right, right.
[5014.54 --> 5015.42]  I guess you need the Sharpie.
[5015.48 --> 5015.96]  That makes sense.
[5016.04 --> 5016.60]  Yes, yes, yes.
[5018.60 --> 5019.96]  No, I think it...
[5020.64 --> 5021.82]  Oh, my goodness, Luke.
[5021.88 --> 5023.66]  Your toy fire truck is going off.
[5023.66 --> 5025.66]  I will see your toy fire truck.
[5029.08 --> 5030.46]  And I will raise you...
[5030.46 --> 5031.76]  No, he didn't do the sign.
[5031.86 --> 5032.48]  Oh, he might be.
[5032.62 --> 5033.08]  He might be.
[5033.54 --> 5033.86]  Dan.
[5036.58 --> 5037.94]  One real fire truck.
[5039.02 --> 5040.12]  You see, we can even shake it.
[5040.92 --> 5041.20]  Yeah.
[5041.40 --> 5041.70]  Yeah.
[5042.06 --> 5042.98]  It's a real fire truck.
[5043.82 --> 5044.84]  It is a real fire truck.
[5044.84 --> 5048.46]  What are we supposed to be doing right now, Dan?
[5049.22 --> 5052.76]  I think you had started another topic, and now you can do another topic.
[5052.86 --> 5053.64]  Sure, let's do a topic.
[5053.70 --> 5055.78]  Did we finish the fire truck topic?
[5055.82 --> 5056.40]  Yeah, I think so.
[5056.40 --> 5057.04]  I think so.
[5057.18 --> 5057.86]  Yes, we did.
[5058.30 --> 5059.10]  Yeah, I think so.
[5059.72 --> 5060.60]  Good job, everyone.
[5061.48 --> 5063.86]  Remember when I asked the audience if I should buy this car?
[5063.92 --> 5065.12]  No, let's do a real topic.
[5065.38 --> 5065.72]  Okay.
[5065.72 --> 5071.12]  LG TVs are going to be losing Google Assistant on May the 1st.
[5071.74 --> 5076.10]  Currently, if you have an LG OLED TV connected to the internet, you can access the Google
[5076.10 --> 5079.60]  Assistant by linking to your account and using the microphone built into the remote.
[5080.28 --> 5084.82]  However, this appears to be going away as a Google Assistant service termination pop-up
[5084.82 --> 5089.78]  has started appearing on LG TVs, noting that the change will take place effective May 1st,
[5089.80 --> 5090.32]  2025.
[5091.18 --> 5098.04]  I, David Pankratz, who is a helper for the writing team, saw this pop-up on my TV at home just
[5098.04 --> 5099.14]  last night.
[5099.98 --> 5104.50]  Basic voice controls will still be available, serviced through LG's Think app.
[5105.04 --> 5109.16]  Samsung also lost Google Assistant functionality back in March of 2024.
[5109.70 --> 5112.64]  And our discussion question is basically not a question.
[5112.64 --> 5120.14]  is that this blows and when you buy a connected product, there appears to be simply no guarantee
[5120.14 --> 5125.86]  whatsoever that the advertised feature set will remain throughout the entire lifetime
[5125.86 --> 5126.52]  of the product.
[5126.64 --> 5133.88]  And there appears to be absolutely no recourse for customers whatsoever or compensation given
[5133.88 --> 5134.68]  to these customers.
[5134.68 --> 5138.84]  And I just don't really understand how this works.
[5138.84 --> 5146.40]  You know, like if I, if I sold you a backpack, let's say, and I said it has two layers in
[5146.40 --> 5146.76]  the bottom.
[5147.44 --> 5150.96]  And then hypothetically, let's say you found out that it didn't.
[5151.44 --> 5155.94]  Are you not owed at the very least some compensation?
[5157.16 --> 5160.76]  I thought so, which is why we offer people gift cards or a refund.
[5161.08 --> 5162.74]  So where is my gift card?
[5163.26 --> 5164.58]  Where is my refund?
[5164.58 --> 5166.86]  This is not the product you sold me.
[5166.92 --> 5167.42]  And you know what?
[5167.50 --> 5169.62]  For most people, it might not be materially different.
[5169.70 --> 5173.20]  But I was looking at discussions about this online and someone brought up a really good
[5173.20 --> 5173.46]  point.
[5173.56 --> 5180.26]  They have relatives that have physical disabilities that make it very challenging to operate their
[5180.26 --> 5181.62]  TV with a remote.
[5182.08 --> 5184.84]  And they extensively used voice controls.
[5184.84 --> 5187.68]  Well, so much for that.
[5190.06 --> 5196.00]  Yeah, I think it comes down to that software is you don't, you don't own that portion of
[5196.00 --> 5196.14]  it.
[5196.20 --> 5198.08]  So they can, they can say whatever you want.
[5198.26 --> 5200.14]  You numbered two of them, 169.
[5200.20 --> 5201.34]  No, the other one is that's a two.
[5201.82 --> 5202.88]  No, it's a two.
[5204.94 --> 5205.88]  That's a two.
[5206.52 --> 5207.82]  It's a really narrow two.
[5207.84 --> 5208.62]  That's a two?
[5208.94 --> 5209.74]  Yeah, it's a two.
[5211.44 --> 5214.20]  It's got a little thing at the top and a little thing on the bottom.
[5214.20 --> 5214.68]  It's a two.
[5214.76 --> 5216.30]  Well, I didn't have a lot of space, Luke.
[5216.36 --> 5218.78]  I couldn't draw a big loopy two.
[5220.30 --> 5221.62]  Were you a loopy two kid?
[5222.56 --> 5222.74]  Yeah.
[5222.84 --> 5223.28]  With the loop?
[5223.40 --> 5225.42]  Yeah, I was a loopy two kid too.
[5225.62 --> 5225.80]  Yeah.
[5226.06 --> 5227.62]  So in summary, that sucks.
[5227.72 --> 5228.38]  LG, do better.
[5229.26 --> 5229.44]  Yeah.
[5230.02 --> 5231.78]  Now we should probably, ugh.
[5232.04 --> 5233.50]  Okay, let's do, I'll do another quick one.
[5234.10 --> 5237.22]  This is not really like news news, but I saw it for the first time.
[5237.26 --> 5237.78]  I thought it was cool.
[5238.98 --> 5242.42]  There's a company mass producing coin-sized nuclear batteries in China.
[5242.42 --> 5256.02]  The company BetaVolt showed off a nuclear battery using a combination of fourth generation diamond semiconductor and a radioactive isotope of nickel, nickel 63, that could power a device, a low power device, mind you.
[5256.10 --> 5259.54]  It does up to 100 microwatts at three volts.
[5259.78 --> 5259.88]  Okay.
[5260.28 --> 5270.98]  Power a device for up to 50 years and measures just 15 by 15 by five millimeters with a larger one watt version expected in 2025.
[5270.98 --> 5275.74]  The nickel eventually decays into non-radioactive copper.
[5276.68 --> 5286.48]  Popular mechanics reported last week that the batteries are now in mass production and will be used for medical and aerospace devices and could even be used in future smartphones.
[5286.84 --> 5292.04]  I have to get the power output up a fair amount, but that would be cool.
[5292.04 --> 5292.86]  One watt is pretty good.
[5292.94 --> 5295.90]  If we're able to do one watt today, maybe we can do more watts.
[5295.90 --> 5296.98]  Oh, yeah, things advance.
[5297.18 --> 5297.78]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[5297.82 --> 5298.72]  Dude, this sounds crazy.
[5298.82 --> 5307.44]  Small nuclear batteries have been used in space travel since the 1960s, and there were even nuclear-powered pacemakers in the 1970s.
[5307.96 --> 5310.60]  Jordan made a mock-up of how small this thing is.
[5310.60 --> 5313.56]  It is under the light control panel.
[5314.48 --> 5315.64]  The thing in the middle.
[5316.00 --> 5317.02]  It should be just right there.
[5317.18 --> 5317.68]  Oh, wow.
[5318.48 --> 5320.34]  That's how small this battery is?
[5320.38 --> 5321.08]  That's wild.
[5321.22 --> 5322.90]  It's like a keycap size almost.
[5323.00 --> 5323.84]  That is so cool.
[5324.84 --> 5330.18]  It kind of helps that we don't have a separate can for this because you can tell it's like it's in my fingers there.
[5331.04 --> 5331.22]  Yeah.
[5331.22 --> 5334.00]  If it's really small, well, yeah, it's really small.
[5334.88 --> 5336.12]  It's like a keycap.
[5336.12 --> 5338.92]  That is super cool.
[5339.60 --> 5340.48]  It is.
[5341.34 --> 5343.10]  Yeah, it's pretty close to a keycap.
[5343.18 --> 5345.56]  Now it's time for a super cool word from our sponsors.

[5533.98 --> 5535.42]  Now we can do anything we want.
[5535.54 --> 5537.40]  All the obligatory stuff is out of the way.
[5537.40 --> 5540.76]  I'd put the siren back on if I could do anything I wanted.
[5541.48 --> 5542.16]  Um...
[5542.16 --> 5543.68]  What do we got here?
[5543.98 --> 5544.34]  Okay.
[5548.06 --> 5549.58]  Why is it so hard to reach?
[5550.42 --> 5553.22]  I think you're supposed to engage the power before you...
[5553.22 --> 5554.14]  Like, as you get in.
[5554.32 --> 5554.66]  All right.
[5554.72 --> 5555.14]  Do you think?
[5555.70 --> 5556.18]  Oh, right.
[5556.96 --> 5557.88]  Oh, the horn!
[5558.22 --> 5559.34]  I thought you said siren.
[5559.54 --> 5559.94]  I did.
[5561.14 --> 5561.50]  Okay.
[5561.70 --> 5562.20]  Pump faked.
[5562.20 --> 5564.38]  We can do the siren, too.
[5564.98 --> 5565.80]  Do it.
[5569.40 --> 5575.16]  Do you want to go on the radio?
[5575.32 --> 5576.76]  Where's the...
[5576.76 --> 5576.96]  There.
[5577.08 --> 5577.60]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[5578.14 --> 5578.90]  Yeah, that works.
[5579.48 --> 5579.74]  Here.
[5580.56 --> 5582.28]  Yeah, you got to set it to radio, though.
[5582.38 --> 5583.40]  I think it's man?
[5585.88 --> 5586.70]  Mr. Besser?
[5587.58 --> 5588.46]  Mr. Besser?
[5588.74 --> 5589.60]  Can I do your copy?
[5589.88 --> 5591.70]  Mr. Besser, 10-4, do you copy?
[5592.20 --> 5592.54]  What?
[5594.22 --> 5595.56]  I can't hear anything now!
[5595.68 --> 5597.18]  I don't know how much of that they can make out.
[5597.48 --> 5598.12]  Yeah, I don't know.
[5598.90 --> 5599.56]  Oh, man.
[5599.90 --> 5600.22]  Incredible.
[5604.10 --> 5604.58]  All right.
[5605.84 --> 5607.00]  Okay, what do we got here?
[5607.54 --> 5608.78]  Stone Monarch asks,
[5608.78 --> 5610.90]  Did I miss the tariff tips?
[5611.58 --> 5612.20]  Should we do it?
[5612.32 --> 5612.82]  We can do it.
[5612.94 --> 5613.74]  Let's talk about...
[5613.74 --> 5613.92]  Yeah.
[5614.12 --> 5615.96]  Let's talk about tariffs.
[5616.86 --> 5620.46]  U.S. administration tariffs spark incoming price pains.
[5620.46 --> 5623.56]  Who could have seen this coming?
[5624.88 --> 5631.76]  The current U.S. administration has announced sweeping new tariffs under a plan dubbed Liberation Day,
[5632.16 --> 5640.02]  including a baseline 10% tariff on everything imported to the U.S., plus reciprocal tariffs
[5640.02 --> 5644.64]  based on how each country allegedly treats U.S. exporters.
[5644.64 --> 5648.94]  These new tariffs reach as high as 46%.
[5648.94 --> 5653.78]  Among those hit hardest, PC builders and tech buyers.
[5654.54 --> 5665.30]  Countries like China, 34%, Taiwan, 32%, South Korea, 25%, and Vietnam, 46%.
[5665.30 --> 5668.60]  And some other kind of hilarious countries.
[5668.60 --> 5679.50]  Are all major sources of SSDs, RAM, GPUs, PC cases, laptops, and basically everything in your rig.
[5680.24 --> 5687.84]  Boutique builders like Main Gear and Falcon Northwest are already warning of 20% to 25% price hikes.
[5687.84 --> 5693.78]  These companies build PCs in the U.S., but rely almost exclusively on parts from Asia.
[5694.18 --> 5694.76]  Parts that...
[5695.54 --> 5703.38]  I'm sorry, but the cold hard truth is that nobody is going to be making in North America anytime soon.
[5704.64 --> 5710.40]  Shortages are already reappearing as suppliers scramble to relocate their production.
[5711.10 --> 5715.04]  Even GPUs, which were already a pricing mess, are taking a hit.
[5715.04 --> 5722.00]  GPU manufacturing lines in China are being paused to shift production to countries that now also have high tariffs.
[5722.10 --> 5724.92]  So there's seemingly nowhere left to hide.
[5725.50 --> 5730.58]  Semiconductors are seemingly exempt, but the machines that are needed to make them
[5730.58 --> 5735.94]  and products that those semiconductors are pre-installed in are not.
[5736.32 --> 5739.36]  Meaning that we could see higher fab costs down the road,
[5739.74 --> 5744.04]  especially if companies want to expand outside the U.S.
[5744.04 --> 5748.48]  So, how were these tariffs calculated?
[5749.30 --> 5757.64]  Economist James Surowiecki says that it appears that the White House simply divided the U.S.
[5757.64 --> 5762.54]  trade deficit by each country's exports to the U.S.
[5762.54 --> 5770.78]  For example, the United States imports $28 billion from Indonesia and exports $10 billion.
[5771.56 --> 5774.68]  Equals 64% tariff.
[5774.68 --> 5784.08]  That is like if I asked my kids to figure it out.
[5784.74 --> 5787.82]  Well, you can ask ChatGPT and then it gives you a pretty similar thing.
[5788.48 --> 5796.34]  But if you're trying to balance trade deficits, like, okay.
[5797.52 --> 5798.32]  Fair enough.
[5798.32 --> 5802.80]  But they said that these were tariffs and these were reciprocal because there was tariffs there.
[5803.02 --> 5804.64]  And that's just flat out not true.
[5806.14 --> 5806.62]  Yeah.
[5807.76 --> 5810.34]  But also there's, you know, there's nuance.
[5810.70 --> 5815.18]  You know, say for example, I mean, wow.
[5815.48 --> 5815.96]  Okay.
[5817.60 --> 5818.36]  All right.
[5819.08 --> 5822.86]  So that's something that people are going to need to deal with.
[5824.34 --> 5827.32]  Dude, Cambodia getting hit with the old 97%.
[5827.32 --> 5828.82]  Yeah.
[5829.40 --> 5829.84]  Sheesh.
[5832.18 --> 5832.98]  So, yeah.
[5833.18 --> 5839.26]  I mean, I guess the good thing about this is that a lot of people who hadn't figured it
[5839.26 --> 5846.14]  out before are kind of figuring, well, as the youth say, finding out now.
[5846.14 --> 5846.40]  Right.
[5846.56 --> 5846.96]  Yes.
[5847.74 --> 5850.10]  There's an interesting political thing with this.
[5850.10 --> 5853.88]  Have you looked at the actual chart itself and the countries listed on it?
[5855.32 --> 5856.08]  No, I haven't.
[5856.08 --> 5858.26]  I've seen recreations of the rates.
[5858.40 --> 5859.38]  Like, I've looked at tables of it.
[5859.42 --> 5860.62]  But no, I haven't looked at the exact chart.
[5860.64 --> 5860.86]  Do you have it up?
[5860.86 --> 5863.36]  The fourth country on the list is Taiwan.
[5864.66 --> 5865.02]  Oh.
[5865.30 --> 5866.30]  Specifically named.
[5866.92 --> 5867.52]  Well, that's cool.
[5867.94 --> 5868.70]  It's interesting.
[5870.00 --> 5871.50]  It's actually very interesting.
[5871.60 --> 5872.22]  I think it's cool.
[5872.32 --> 5872.80]  In my opinion.
[5872.84 --> 5873.34]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5873.44 --> 5875.58]  I mean, I think I've been pretty upfront that-
[5875.58 --> 5876.72]  Yeah, I think we both have.
[5876.86 --> 5877.36]  I just-
[5877.36 --> 5878.12]  Taiwan's a country.
[5878.22 --> 5879.16]  I'm surprised.
[5879.80 --> 5880.62]  I'll say that much.
[5880.62 --> 5883.12]  Taiwan has its own federal government.
[5883.90 --> 5886.62]  I mean, I-
[5886.62 --> 5888.30]  Is that-
[5888.30 --> 5890.84]  They could be invaded by another country.
[5891.64 --> 5896.76]  That sovereign government could be replaced.
[5896.76 --> 5905.02]  But if you, like, have your own federal government, you, like, you know, are a country, right?
[5905.76 --> 5905.94]  Yeah.
[5906.02 --> 5906.56]  Someone in chat-
[5906.56 --> 5907.70]  I haven't verified this myself.
[5907.70 --> 5907.86]  They have their own military.
[5908.18 --> 5910.98]  But someone in chat said it also includes several uninhabited islands.
[5911.18 --> 5911.32]  Yeah.
[5911.32 --> 5911.92]  Yeah, I saw that.
[5911.92 --> 5916.16]  I heard that it includes a country of 3,000 people.
[5916.30 --> 5916.58]  Yeah.
[5917.14 --> 5921.74]  It includes at least one, like, island that literally doesn't export anything to the U.S.
[5921.86 --> 5922.24]  What-
[5922.24 --> 5922.82]  What is-
[5922.82 --> 5923.30]  Which one?
[5923.60 --> 5924.16]  I forget.
[5924.44 --> 5925.44]  It's some, like-
[5925.44 --> 5929.36]  Because I've heard people say that, but I haven't, like, looked into these things.
[5932.78 --> 5933.40]  But yeah.
[5933.64 --> 5934.16]  Pretty great.
[5934.68 --> 5935.52]  Pretty great.
[5935.62 --> 5936.74]  I don't see Canada here.
[5937.46 --> 5937.90]  Canada.
[5938.06 --> 5939.30]  You'll find Canada eventually.
[5940.16 --> 5940.66]  Is it on here?
[5940.66 --> 5944.06]  Yeah, there are some countries that curiously dodged tariffs.
[5944.26 --> 5945.00]  So that was interesting.
[5945.10 --> 5946.42]  It's weird that it's in no order.
[5946.60 --> 5948.22]  Like, it's not in a-
[5948.22 --> 5950.56]  It doesn't-
[5950.56 --> 5951.58]  It's not in alphabetical order.
[5951.72 --> 5954.28]  It's not in, like, size of the tariffs order.
[5954.46 --> 5956.72]  It's not in size of the reciprocal tariffs order.
[5956.90 --> 5957.30]  It's just-
[5957.30 --> 5959.06]  It just seems to be totally random.
[5963.08 --> 5965.48]  Yeah, I only have a picture of two of them.
[5967.16 --> 5968.58]  Canada's not included in that list.
[5968.62 --> 5969.52]  It has separate tariffs.
[5969.52 --> 5970.32]  Ah, very cool.
[5970.42 --> 5970.78]  Very good.
[5970.88 --> 5971.56]  Very nice.
[5971.96 --> 5972.62]  Very demure.
[5976.12 --> 5977.04]  Oh, man.
[5977.56 --> 5978.78]  Well, yeah.
[5981.46 --> 5982.48]  Good luck, everybody.
[5983.62 --> 5985.28]  So, let's talk about LTT Store.
[5985.76 --> 5986.42]  I have-
[5986.42 --> 5990.38]  This is scripted from Terran, so I'm not going to deviate too much from it.
[5990.38 --> 5993.86]  Apparently, a U.S. military base is in the list of tariffs.
[5995.86 --> 5997.20]  Sorry, that's really funny.
[5997.70 --> 5998.12]  Okay.
[5998.54 --> 5999.74]  We can keep going.
[5999.74 --> 6006.84]  Unless you're just joining the show, you've probably heard about the broad tariffs.
[6006.84 --> 6012.48]  I think the original draft of this said, unless you've been living under a rock, I see someone's done another pass.
[6012.98 --> 6018.78]  Anyway, you've probably heard about the broad tariffs that have already come into effect or will on May the 2nd.
[6018.78 --> 6024.50]  We've seen some questions about what this will mean for pricing on LTT Store.com.
[6024.50 --> 6041.96]  Well, the team has been working diligently behind the scenes, basically since last November, to minimize the total costs to our customers, who we recognize are not the people that we are at trade war with.
[6041.96 --> 6059.98]  And I'm going to share some of these initiatives with you, including, one, offsetting some of the cost of tariffs by negotiating with our suppliers to help ensure that we are getting the best costs possible so that we can keep our prices reasonable for you.
[6060.74 --> 6066.32]  Number two, exploring new manufacturing locations, though, as we just discussed recently.
[6067.06 --> 6067.24]  Huh.
[6068.36 --> 6069.42]  Where now?
[6069.56 --> 6070.08]  I don't know.
[6070.08 --> 6070.82]  Okay, sure.
[6070.82 --> 6079.52]  Number three, rolling out Canadian pricing for Canadian customers soon, TM.
[6079.78 --> 6080.46]  Working on it.
[6080.92 --> 6091.64]  Because in the past, there's been really no point because our costs are in USD, because that's traditionally been the international currency of international trade.
[6092.04 --> 6097.34]  And our pricing has been derived from our costs plus some markup.
[6097.34 --> 6101.88]  So there was really not much point in us having a CAD price.
[6102.30 --> 6114.36]  But now our pricing in USD is going to be derived from our cost in USD plus, pardon my French, bulls**t tariffs plus our margin.
[6114.36 --> 6119.90]  So they no longer get to be equivalent.
[6119.90 --> 6121.06]  Some of the delay.
[6121.06 --> 6121.46]  Some of the delay.
[6121.46 --> 6123.06]  I'm just adding here.
[6123.06 --> 6125.50]  Some of the delay there is we never expected this.
[6125.50 --> 6130.14]  So a lot of the things that we built for the store were built expecting one store to exist.
[6130.14 --> 6130.58]  Yeah.
[6131.04 --> 6137.34]  So some of our stuff needs to be adapted to be able to support more than one store, which is maybe useful in the future.
[6137.34 --> 6140.08]  I don't know, but work that needs to be done.
[6140.08 --> 6152.12]  And number four is that we are rapidly accelerating our efforts to explore localized fulfillment so we can get our products to you faster with lower shipping costs.
[6152.40 --> 6154.82]  This will be a phased approach.
[6155.30 --> 6156.32]  It's going to take time.
[6156.32 --> 6160.02]  Unfortunately, none of these things is a magic bullet.
[6160.14 --> 6163.88]  We're going to do our best to hold existing prices on whatever we can afford.
[6164.22 --> 6169.62]  But customers should expect that costs will go up as we approach May the 2nd.
[6170.08 --> 6174.48]  We will do everything in our power to minimize the impact of the tariffs on what you pay for your products.
[6174.96 --> 6177.30]  But this tariff situation is tough.
[6177.80 --> 6179.06]  It's tough on us.
[6179.24 --> 6180.28]  We don't want to raise prices.
[6180.54 --> 6181.66]  And it's tough on you.
[6182.00 --> 6183.96]  You do not want to pay higher prices.
[6183.96 --> 6195.44]  The one thing that we can always control and that we will continue to control is that we will provide our customers with excellent, high-quality products and with outstanding Trust Me Bro support.
[6196.00 --> 6199.34]  And we'll do that no matter what external forces arise.
[6201.20 --> 6201.96]  So that's...
[6202.60 --> 6203.72]  How do returns work?
[6203.82 --> 6204.86]  That's all I have to say about that.
[6206.20 --> 6208.48]  We'll probably just end up eating some stuff there.
[6208.94 --> 6209.34]  Yikes.
[6209.94 --> 6210.36]  I don't know.
[6210.36 --> 6211.36]  I mean, look...
[6211.36 --> 6213.84]  I never actually thought about this before.
[6213.92 --> 6217.52]  But yeah, if you buy something, get it tariffed on the way in.
[6217.68 --> 6220.62]  I'm sure you don't get a refund for your tariff when you return it.
[6221.86 --> 6223.06]  I actually don't.
[6223.10 --> 6223.92]  I have no idea.
[6224.02 --> 6225.58]  We've never had to deal with this.
[6225.78 --> 6225.88]  Not a clue.
[6225.88 --> 6226.46]  That's the thing.
[6226.84 --> 6234.52]  And I'm not necessarily convinced that the effort is being made to staff the organization,
[6234.52 --> 6238.60]  the government organizations that are supposed to be dealing with all of this,
[6238.80 --> 6241.98]  to make the experience smooth and fast.
[6243.24 --> 6243.68]  I...
[6243.68 --> 6244.18]  I...
[6244.18 --> 6249.36]  Will floatplane pricing be going up as well?
[6249.46 --> 6250.64]  I don't think there's a...
[6250.64 --> 6253.52]  We have no plans to alter anything about floatplane pricing.
[6253.52 --> 6262.80]  Like I said, look, we are not one of those kinds of companies that looks for inflation in a headline or, you know...
[6262.80 --> 6263.58]  And then pumps it.
[6263.62 --> 6268.66]  Or takes a global emergency like COVID and uses it as an opportunity to raise our pricing.
[6268.66 --> 6273.00]  Like I see a ton of criticism all the time of how expensive our products are.
[6273.18 --> 6279.64]  For crying out loud, find me another merch store that sells high quality printed t-shirts for 20 bucks.
[6280.28 --> 6283.66]  Show me another creator who sells that for 20 bucks.
[6284.46 --> 6286.12]  That matches our quality.
[6286.74 --> 6289.48]  The quality is outstanding as proven by Project Farm.
[6290.18 --> 6290.30]  Right?
[6290.40 --> 6291.66]  Like it is...
[6291.66 --> 6293.80]  We do try our best.
[6293.86 --> 6294.70]  We have to make money.
[6295.14 --> 6296.12]  That's how we survive.
[6296.12 --> 6299.42]  That's how we make the content that you guys enjoy.
[6299.52 --> 6301.18]  That's how we pay the people you like.
[6301.50 --> 6302.24]  You know, like...
[6302.24 --> 6302.54]  Hopefully.
[6302.78 --> 6303.70]  We have to make money.
[6304.08 --> 6304.28]  Right?
[6304.76 --> 6305.48]  But we're not...
[6305.48 --> 6306.50]  We're not predatory.
[6306.64 --> 6308.42]  We're not trying to be unreasonable or anything.
[6308.72 --> 6312.56]  So we're not going to say like, oh, there's tariffs and general uncertainty.
[6312.80 --> 6314.20]  So we're going to jack up floatplane pricing.
[6314.38 --> 6319.56]  I have telegraphed already in the past that we are going to have to increase floatplane pricing at some point.
[6320.28 --> 6322.46]  But we're not going to claim that it's because of this.
[6322.46 --> 6324.46]  It's just because, hey, we haven't touched pricing in...
[6324.46 --> 6326.76]  Eight years?
[6326.88 --> 6327.62]  Something like that.
[6327.72 --> 6327.90]  Yeah.
[6330.04 --> 6333.16]  And we have a lot more resources that go into floatplane now.
[6333.36 --> 6335.94]  We have dedicated people that work on nothing but floatplane now.
[6336.90 --> 6339.76]  And I mean on the content side, like the LTT side.
[6339.80 --> 6341.54]  I don't mean on the floatplane media side.
[6341.62 --> 6342.88]  We always had dedicated people there.
[6343.30 --> 6344.62]  And I mean that in both senses.
[6344.78 --> 6345.92]  The floatplane team is incredible.
[6346.30 --> 6347.00]  Very dedicated.
[6347.00 --> 6350.84]  Where was I going with that?
[6350.92 --> 6351.04]  Right.
[6351.16 --> 6354.40]  So yeah, we're not going to like make excuses and just like jack up prices.
[6354.54 --> 6355.40]  That's not our way.
[6355.86 --> 6358.14]  But there will be an impact.
[6358.26 --> 6364.78]  Like if our cost on something to deliver it to you goes up by tens of percent.
[6364.78 --> 6369.94]  I don't have that kind of margin to just absorb it on everything.
[6371.34 --> 6377.36]  And I don't think it's reasonable to say, oh, well, you know, Linus, you should just eat it.
[6377.44 --> 6378.90]  You should just make nothing on this.
[6379.64 --> 6380.06]  Why?
[6380.78 --> 6383.64]  What did I do such that I should do that?
[6383.64 --> 6389.24]  And are you okay telling everyone that works here that they don't get raises because we're making literally nothing?
[6392.40 --> 6393.80]  Wouldn't even just be not raises.
[6393.80 --> 6396.10]  If we're making literally nothing, then people are getting fired.
[6396.52 --> 6398.26]  Well, that wouldn't be fired.
[6398.60 --> 6401.62]  So there's an important distinction between fired and laid off.
[6401.84 --> 6404.74]  Fired is dismissed for lack of performance.
[6405.46 --> 6410.44]  Laid off is dismissed for lack of work for the company to do for you.
[6410.44 --> 6414.66]  So I would consider that to be more of a layoff than a termination.
[6414.86 --> 6415.50]  A couple of questions.
[6416.18 --> 6421.10]  People outside of the U.S. or Canada are wondering if anything's going to happen to their pricing.
[6421.36 --> 6421.58]  No.
[6421.70 --> 6424.22]  Like I said, we're not looking for excuses to jack up pricing.
[6425.38 --> 6436.34]  And we don't expect, you know, our European customers to subsidize the business that will inevitably be reduced to our friends down south.
[6436.44 --> 6437.60]  And I mean that, right?
[6437.60 --> 6442.48]  Like there's a lot of Canadians that are, you know, all very, you know, fuck America or whatever.
[6442.62 --> 6442.74]  Right?
[6442.78 --> 6443.32]  But I'm not.
[6443.88 --> 6449.76]  We have many people who we consider to be friends of ourselves, whether that's personally.
[6450.10 --> 6452.48]  We have friends of our business.
[6452.66 --> 6456.42]  You know, the people who have supported us for all these years.
[6456.42 --> 6457.14]  Right?
[6457.28 --> 6464.48]  Like we are, we are, we have absolutely, we bear no ill will to the American people who have done absolutely nothing.
[6464.56 --> 6468.78]  And quite frankly, we'll be the ones suffering the brunt of a lot of this.
[6468.86 --> 6469.50]  It's going to be rough.
[6469.78 --> 6472.12]  Like we're not looking to add insult to injury for y'all.
[6472.48 --> 6472.78]  Right?
[6473.78 --> 6475.36]  We just also have to survive.
[6475.36 --> 6475.94]  Yeah.
[6482.94 --> 6483.50]  Cool.
[6483.50 --> 6489.82]  Survive with our scenic mode on Vizio TVs.
[6490.32 --> 6491.08]  Oh my God.
[6491.68 --> 6492.56]  This is so upsetting.
[6495.52 --> 6502.78]  Vizio TV user reports scenic mode intersperses relaxing ambient content interspersed with political ads.
[6502.78 --> 6503.78]  What?
[6503.78 --> 6521.94]  Last week, Reddit user DoubleJumps claimed, if I leave my Vizio TV idol, it plays calming nature videos, calming music, and then loops a message from the Trump admin telling illegal immigrants to get out over and over and over again.
[6521.94 --> 6525.48]  Link to Reddit post with the ad in question.
[6526.10 --> 6529.68]  DoubleJumps followed it up with, I left it on to see if it would do it again.
[6529.82 --> 6533.38]  And it played the whole video again after about 20 minutes.
[6534.04 --> 6535.50]  Just the once this time.
[6536.06 --> 6543.10]  This behavior comes out of scenic mode, a feature that displays relaxing ambient content when your TV is idle for a period of time.
[6543.52 --> 6546.44]  Scenic mode is free, but supported by ads with no option.
[6546.44 --> 6548.44]  I shouldn't...
[6548.44 --> 6552.02]  TVs are so crap these days, dude.
[6552.04 --> 6556.90]  Luke, you thought you were jumping into a topic that would be, like, happy, didn't you?
[6556.90 --> 6558.40]  Yeah, I did, to be completely honest.
[6558.40 --> 6559.28]  You were excited for scenic mode.
[6559.28 --> 6560.78]  I just read scenic mode.
[6560.92 --> 6562.62]  I didn't read the rest of it.
[6563.96 --> 6565.34]  Oh, man.
[6565.40 --> 6566.04]  Oh, man.
[6566.08 --> 6568.34]  You got bamboozled.
[6568.36 --> 6569.18]  This is brutal.
[6569.42 --> 6576.34]  Scenic mode is free, as it should be, but supported by ads, which is ridiculous.
[6576.44 --> 6579.28]  With no option to turn the ad content off, which is ridiculous.
[6579.68 --> 6584.34]  Settings exist to turn off sound in scenic mode or to disable scenic mode completely.
[6585.28 --> 6585.72]  Bamboozled.
[6586.10 --> 6590.48]  Yeah, you have the option to turn off this thing that is totally free, but supported by ads.
[6590.64 --> 6591.06]  Okay, cool.
[6591.06 --> 6592.10]  Dude, that is so funny.
[6592.10 --> 6600.92]  Ars Technica reports that they were unable to replicate this particular ad internally and had not seen other reports of Vizio TV owners seeing it.
[6601.10 --> 6601.18]  Okay.
[6601.98 --> 6604.94]  Vizio has had ties to political ads in the past.
[6604.94 --> 6628.78]  In a Vizio case study, they state Vizio recently worked with a political candidate on an ad campaign that combined CTV ads with our Household Connect omni-channel feature to reach potential voters both on their TV sets and on other opted-in devices like laptop computers, mobile phones, and tablets.
[6628.78 --> 6635.00]  Okay, so they clearly do work with political advertisers.
[6636.12 --> 6645.12]  So our discussion question is, would you pay extra for a TV that is not subsidized by ads and telemetry being sent back to the manufacturer?
[6645.74 --> 6653.64]  I mean, it's such a hypothetical question because if you want a high quality set, like high image quality, that's what you're getting.
[6653.64 --> 6654.08]  Yep.
[6654.52 --> 6656.00]  With that said, you know what?
[6657.70 --> 6664.50]  My TCL TV, because it's a China model, doesn't serve me anything.
[6664.50 --> 6665.26]  There's no ad servers?
[6665.98 --> 6668.32]  I don't think, I've never seen an ad on it.
[6668.34 --> 6668.68]  Whoa.
[6668.88 --> 6674.12]  I have it configured to go straight to my usual source because I use an AVR.
[6674.36 --> 6674.78]  And you didn't-
[6674.78 --> 6676.94]  So all my sources go into that and then just one connection goes.
[6676.98 --> 6679.00]  So it just goes straight to input two.
[6679.30 --> 6680.84]  You had to individually import that, right?
[6680.84 --> 6681.28]  Yeah.
[6681.58 --> 6687.36]  So the new bougie thing for TV owners is to individually import them from China so you don't get ads.
[6687.36 --> 6688.76]  Or from some other region.
[6689.32 --> 6691.32]  That won't have ad servers for North America.
[6691.48 --> 6691.82]  Yeah.
[6693.98 --> 6695.40]  Ahead of the curve again.
[6696.24 --> 6696.98]  Let's go.
[6697.02 --> 6697.96]  That's kind of sick.
[6697.98 --> 6699.58]  And drive around in your fire truck.
[6701.52 --> 6702.00]  Yeah.
[6702.30 --> 6702.74]  Nice.
[6703.16 --> 6703.48]  Yeah.
[6703.90 --> 6704.64]  Oh my goodness.
[6704.74 --> 6706.04]  This is so ridiculous.
[6706.04 --> 6711.32]  I mean, we're going to have to maybe revisit Piehole.
[6711.68 --> 6714.46]  Just kind of see what-
[6714.46 --> 6715.82]  This is genuinely absurd.
[6716.30 --> 6716.46]  Yeah.
[6716.46 --> 6720.82]  I can't stand this, like, we're shoving ads into everything.
[6721.12 --> 6724.54]  The fact that Windows has ads is offensive to me.
[6724.96 --> 6728.16]  The fact that a TV can just force it down your throat is absurd.
[6728.56 --> 6730.48]  Like, this is not-
[6730.48 --> 6731.60]  And, like, there's-
[6731.60 --> 6734.82]  The problem is there isn't a capitalistic answer here.
[6735.20 --> 6738.28]  You can't vote with your wallet and buy one that doesn't have the ads.
[6738.30 --> 6738.68]  You apparently can.
[6739.04 --> 6743.12]  Stone Monarch says you can get business-grade TVs that-
[6743.12 --> 6745.32]  And some of them, like digital signage, are different.
[6745.60 --> 6749.92]  But you can apparently get business-grade TVs that are just consumer ones without the smart garbage.
[6750.12 --> 6751.92]  But they cost a lot more.
[6752.48 --> 6755.40]  I don't think that's necessarily going to send the right message.
[6755.90 --> 6756.42]  Well, yeah.
[6756.50 --> 6759.12]  Giving them way more money is not going to send the right message.
[6759.12 --> 6759.80]  No, but it's also-
[6759.80 --> 6761.20]  I don't think it's necessarily going to-
[6761.20 --> 6765.72]  I think their analytics would not report, hey, users didn't want to buy the ad-supported ones.
[6765.88 --> 6766.76]  No, not even a little.
[6766.76 --> 6768.94]  They're not going to get the right answer from this.
[6769.04 --> 6771.80]  So the whole voting with your wallet thing, you're not casting a vote by doing that.
[6771.98 --> 6772.00]  No.
[6772.08 --> 6773.42]  You're getting the result you want.
[6773.54 --> 6778.74]  You're giving, like, asshole companies that screwed you more money.
[6779.02 --> 6780.42]  It's not no ad tax.
[6780.50 --> 6781.24]  It's business tax.
[6781.38 --> 6784.88]  Business things just cost more money because they know that businesses will pay for it.
[6785.40 --> 6785.68]  Oh.
[6788.86 --> 6789.30]  Man.
[6790.42 --> 6790.86]  Brutal.
[6792.60 --> 6794.46]  Silversonic says, don't connect your TV to Wi-Fi.
[6794.84 --> 6796.08]  Actually, oh.
[6796.68 --> 6797.00]  Okay.
[6797.86 --> 6800.86]  We're announcing a partnership with someone at some point.
[6800.92 --> 6805.26]  And as some part of it, I talk about how I like my NVIDIA Shield Pro.
[6806.22 --> 6812.08]  And the reason that I like it is that I use that instead of my TV's smart interface.
[6812.34 --> 6814.90]  Because especially because my TV doesn't have one properly.
[6815.40 --> 6816.56]  Because it's a Chinese TV.
[6816.68 --> 6818.38]  So it has all these, like, Chinese streaming services.
[6818.48 --> 6820.84]  And I don't think it's, like, Netflix certified and stuff like that.
[6821.10 --> 6823.04]  So I use my Shield Pro.
[6823.42 --> 6824.56]  And, yeah, that's a really good point.
[6824.82 --> 6834.16]  Because if you have a third-party Android box connected to your TV, there's absolutely no reason that I can think of that you would need your TV connected to the network.
[6834.16 --> 6837.44]  And then if it's not connected to the network, then you're G2G.
[6838.40 --> 6839.82]  So that, you know, there.
[6840.00 --> 6840.64]  You could do that.
[6841.36 --> 6842.44]  You shouldn't have to do that.
[6842.54 --> 6843.98]  You should be able to get updates and stuff.
[6844.22 --> 6844.56]  Sorry, what?
[6844.94 --> 6845.94]  No, I was making sure.
[6845.94 --> 6846.86]  Oh, you nerd.
[6846.86 --> 6851.16]  Okay, what else we got?
[6851.42 --> 6852.86]  Gmail gets end-to-end encryption.
[6853.50 --> 6854.46]  But not really.
[6854.78 --> 6859.30]  On Tuesday, Google announced that end-to-end encrypted messages were coming to Gmail for business users.
[6859.70 --> 6869.20]  By definition, end-to-end encryption means Alice can send a message to Bob with the encryption and decryption happening on their end-user devices.
[6869.20 --> 6875.70]  No one else should be able to decrypt the communications, even if the communications are routed through their systems, Google's in this case.
[6875.98 --> 6878.74]  But that is not the case with Google's implementation.
[6879.20 --> 6884.38]  If Bob's organization is using Gmail, then the organization manages Bob's encryption keys.
[6884.50 --> 6889.02]  So administrators with access to the keys can snoop on the communications at any time.
[6889.36 --> 6890.20]  That's...
[6890.20 --> 6892.26]  Okay, I see.
[6892.54 --> 6896.06]  That's probably a good thing as far as organizations are concerned.
[6897.76 --> 6899.00]  Needed that little caveat.
[6899.00 --> 6899.72]  There on the end.
[6900.04 --> 6902.96]  But users should be aware that their messages are not private.
[6903.24 --> 6904.86]  And I think that's a fair statement.
[6904.86 --> 6906.48]  I mean, here's a question for you.
[6907.86 --> 6915.12]  Do the users of corporate-provided communications platforms think...
[6915.12 --> 6915.76]  I'm going to let you finish.
[6916.10 --> 6918.78]  ...that their communications are private?
[6919.04 --> 6919.70]  Absolutely.
[6921.28 --> 6921.92]  Really?
[6922.22 --> 6923.80]  A hundred percent.
[6923.80 --> 6930.46]  I said that like I couldn't believe it, but I do know that.
[6930.46 --> 6931.66]  We've done some...
[6932.66 --> 6943.94]  Investigations in the past where, thankfully, messages were sent that were very helpful in exonerating the company.
[6945.10 --> 6946.14]  Yeah, for sure.
[6946.14 --> 6946.84]  Put it that way.
[6947.14 --> 6947.30]  Yeah.
[6947.42 --> 6948.28]  I mean, there's lots.
[6949.96 --> 6951.34]  But I'm going to ask again.
[6952.76 --> 6953.16]  Really?
[6954.24 --> 6957.66]  Would someone really be on like their corporate chat thinking...
[6957.66 --> 6957.98]  You know what?
[6958.06 --> 6958.70]  I'll say...
[6958.70 --> 6961.64]  For people that think they're like in the know on this as well.
[6961.86 --> 6963.94]  Something that I'll point out that people still...
[6963.94 --> 6967.94]  Even people that think they're in the know on this sometimes find surprising is...
[6968.80 --> 6971.14]  Like in Slack or Teams, you can message yourself.
[6973.78 --> 6976.30]  That's still on the company program.
[6976.64 --> 6977.10]  Well, yeah.
[6978.86 --> 6979.76]  People think...
[6979.76 --> 6981.02]  Wow, this is crazy.
[6983.76 --> 6984.76]  I expect...
[6984.76 --> 6990.86]  I 100% expect my communication to be private within my organization, only be viewable by the individuals that they are addressed to.
[6991.16 --> 6991.38]  No.
[6991.80 --> 6992.98]  Why would you expect that?
[6992.98 --> 6994.92]  I gotta go delete some files.
[7002.82 --> 7003.26]  Like...
[7003.26 --> 7003.62]  Huh.
[7003.70 --> 7004.20]  Smarten up!
[7005.00 --> 7005.64]  And it like...
[7005.64 --> 7012.92]  You know, you might be at an organization where you feel like you can trust the administrators to a certain degree and...
[7012.92 --> 7018.66]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but that doesn't change the fact that it could be looked into, right?
[7018.70 --> 7019.16]  Like we...
[7019.16 --> 7020.14]  We did something...
[7020.14 --> 7020.80]  I don't even remember what it was.
[7020.90 --> 7021.50]  Dan might remember.
[7021.50 --> 7029.54]  We did something security-wise not that long ago where we could see more activity of users on the network here at work.
[7029.60 --> 7030.48]  Was that Ninja, Dan?
[7030.60 --> 7033.24]  I believe it was Ninja and it was quite draconian.
[7033.24 --> 7034.20]  Yeah.
[7034.20 --> 7034.24]  Yeah.
[7034.40 --> 7034.64]  Yeah.
[7034.64 --> 7045.44]  So we started seeing the things that we could do and sent out a company-wide notice informing people that these things were possible, but we didn't have the intent of doing them.
[7045.44 --> 7046.20]  But we...
[7046.20 --> 7050.24]  Despite not having the intent of doing them, we wanted to inform everyone that they were possible...
[7050.24 --> 7050.44]  Right.
[7050.54 --> 7054.72]  ...to kind of wake people up to the idea of like, this isn't your device.
[7054.72 --> 7055.56]  Unique username says...
[7055.56 --> 7056.62]  This isn't your network.
[7056.98 --> 7062.76]  Unique username says, at Linus, I imagine there are some legal exceptions, but...
[7063.76 --> 7064.90]  To what?
[7064.96 --> 7065.50]  Why what?
[7065.62 --> 7067.28]  Like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7068.08 --> 7070.42]  It's black and white, right?
[7070.42 --> 7075.26]  If there is some legal reason that the company might need to access your communications.
[7075.26 --> 7087.02]  Say, for example, if you were terminated and maliciously refused to give up information that the company needed to continue to operate.
[7087.40 --> 7092.68]  Like, there was that thing recently where Buddy sabotaged the systems before he left a company or something like that.
[7092.76 --> 7093.50]  It's happened a few times.
[7093.60 --> 7093.70]  Yeah.
[7093.86 --> 7095.56]  The kill switch one, is that what you're talking about?
[7095.66 --> 7096.30]  Yeah, I think so.
[7096.30 --> 7105.74]  Anyway, the point is, there could be some reason that the company could need to go into your communications and have a valid reason for needing to access it.
[7106.50 --> 7107.28]  So they can.
[7107.88 --> 7108.54]  That's it.
[7108.90 --> 7109.78]  It's black and white.
[7109.78 --> 7122.28]  If there is any reason why they would need to be able to access it at all, and they are able to for any reason, then they are able to.
[7122.28 --> 7128.22]  So, I'm not saying if that's right.
[7128.66 --> 7130.34]  I'm not saying if that's reasonable.
[7130.68 --> 7132.40]  I'm saying that that is.
[7133.50 --> 7135.10]  And that's what it is.
[7135.58 --> 7139.04]  So, it's something that you should definitely be aware of.
[7139.68 --> 7144.10]  Stop using your corporate stuff for things that are private matters.
[7144.28 --> 7146.44]  I 100% use my corporate email for everything.
[7147.28 --> 7148.44]  Enter corporate computer.
[7148.56 --> 7149.02]  You own the company.
[7149.14 --> 7150.08]  Yeah, that's a little different.
[7150.24 --> 7151.98]  I do too, but you're not going to fire me.
[7151.98 --> 7154.66]  But we'll have receipts, Luke.
[7154.86 --> 7155.98]  And if I do...
[7157.08 --> 7163.08]  We're going to put it out, boys!
[7167.58 --> 7168.60]  I'm already deaf now.
[7168.64 --> 7168.94]  It's fine.
[7171.76 --> 7173.00]  I love this thing.
[7173.24 --> 7174.44]  I love this thing.
[7175.44 --> 7177.54]  You're a strange person, and it's great.
[7181.54 --> 7182.02]  Okay.
[7183.54 --> 7184.54]  Speaking of strange...
[7185.18 --> 7185.72]  Is it that strange?
[7185.78 --> 7186.40]  It's not that strange.
[7186.40 --> 7191.48]  Intel and TSMC reportedly reach a preliminary agreement to form a joint chipmaking venture.
[7191.48 --> 7201.80]  On April 3rd, Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., TSMC, reached a preliminary agreement to form a joint venture operating Intel's fabs in the U.S.
[7202.16 --> 7205.52]  TSMC will take a 20% stake in the new company.
[7205.92 --> 7214.06]  The White House and Commerce Department officials have been pressing TSMC and Intel to make some sort of deal to help resolve the long-running crisis at Intel.
[7214.06 --> 7219.86]  I think also largely because the U.S. wants to domesticate chip manufacturing, but okay.
[7221.30 --> 7227.20]  Intel reported a net loss for 2024 of $18.8 billion.
[7227.94 --> 7230.36]  Its first loss since 1986.
[7230.86 --> 7232.38]  And boy, howdy, is it a big one.
[7232.38 --> 7244.24]  Last month, TSMC reportedly approached NVIDIA, AMD, reportedly is a very key word here, approached NVIDIA, AMD, and Broadcom to take stakes in a joint venture operating Intel's factories.
[7244.64 --> 7249.26]  Later, NVIDIA and a TSMC board member denied these discussions.
[7249.70 --> 7251.24]  That's why I said reportedly.
[7251.24 --> 7264.76]  Also, last month, TSMC said at a press event that it plans to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the U.S. that involves building five additional chip facilities.
[7265.28 --> 7275.78]  This all comes very shortly after Intel appointed former board member Lit Bhutan, there's your name in front of it, as its CEO in March 2025.
[7275.78 --> 7290.74]  So our discussion question is, who can save us from a TSMC monopoly on high-performance chip production if TSMC literally has a 20% stake in the company that operates the fabs for their only reasonable competitor?
[7290.74 --> 7310.00]  Well, especially with the changes to American political global approach, or however you want to call that, it is ridiculously in Taiwan's best interest to death grip that monopoly as hard as they can.
[7310.18 --> 7311.92]  So I suspect they will be doing so.
[7312.16 --> 7317.08]  Payno Cat says, I lost a ton based on Linus's totally great investment advice on Intel.
[7317.08 --> 7320.94]  First of all, I do not give investment advice, and I never have.
[7321.20 --> 7328.14]  Second of all, I said that if I was interested in it, it would be a very long-term trade.
[7328.14 --> 7329.78]  Yeah, I remember that very specifically.
[7330.28 --> 7337.56]  Your form of long-term might be different, but with my extremely ignorant stance on stock trading, this is not long-form yet.
[7337.56 --> 7345.02]  In the long-term, China will invade Taiwan.
[7346.02 --> 7363.20]  When that happens, any fab that is not on the island of Taiwan, any fab operator who does not have their key fabs on the island of Taiwan is going to benefit.
[7363.20 --> 7366.50]  I'd love to be wrong.
[7367.00 --> 7373.82]  I would love very much to be wrong, but I haven't seen anything to indicate that that is not going to happen at some point.
[7378.32 --> 7378.76]  Okay!
[7379.22 --> 7380.82]  And none of that is investment advice.
[7380.82 --> 7385.02]  Is that it?
[7385.82 --> 7386.06]  No?
[7386.64 --> 7387.34]  Wait, maybe?
[7387.42 --> 7387.86]  Your car.
[7388.04 --> 7388.42]  The car.
[7388.94 --> 7389.44]  The car.
[7390.44 --> 7390.94]  That's it.
[7391.08 --> 7391.66]  That's the last one.
[7391.94 --> 7393.22]  No, no, we have some announcements.
[7393.64 --> 7393.86]  Luke.
[7394.00 --> 7394.24]  Oh.
[7394.42 --> 7395.36]  We have some good news.
[7395.64 --> 7395.84]  What?
[7395.84 --> 7396.62]  Some bad news.
[7396.72 --> 7396.88]  Oh.
[7397.06 --> 7398.32]  And then some good news for you.
[7399.10 --> 7399.98]  Good news number one.
[7400.28 --> 7402.46]  Remember those tall blank t-shirts you've been asking for?
[7402.80 --> 7403.78]  Yes, I do.
[7403.84 --> 7404.74]  Well, they're back, baby.
[7404.82 --> 7405.46]  They're in stock.
[7405.56 --> 7408.34]  They're the same comfy, long-lasting blend as our regular t-shirts.
[7408.34 --> 7412.52]  But a little longer for the more vertically gifted out there.
[7412.66 --> 7413.78]  I already bought five.
[7413.92 --> 7417.00]  We have both long-sleeve and short-sleeve t-shirts back in stock.
[7417.08 --> 7420.80]  You can get them now at lmg.gg slash tall tee.
[7421.18 --> 7424.72]  I didn't even wait to try to get a request in.
[7424.80 --> 7426.08]  Look how tall it is!
[7426.28 --> 7429.10]  Because I was warned that we were going to sold out.
[7429.20 --> 7430.36]  Who tucks in a tall t-shirt?
[7430.70 --> 7432.42]  Because we have already...
[7432.42 --> 7432.90]  Tall tee!
[7433.10 --> 7433.60]  Let's go!
[7433.60 --> 7436.16]  We have already sold out...
[7436.16 --> 7437.16]  Sold, not sold out.
[7437.24 --> 7439.34]  We have already sold very many of them.
[7439.46 --> 7439.92]  Ah, yes.
[7440.26 --> 7445.68]  Without even announcing it on WAN Show, we sold an absolute butt-ton of these.
[7445.88 --> 7446.98]  I told you you would!
[7447.22 --> 7448.02]  The bad news.
[7448.76 --> 7452.14]  We sold out of Sarah's latest Floatplane exclusive t-shirt.
[7452.68 --> 7453.86]  Were you able to grab one?
[7454.24 --> 7454.54]  No.
[7455.50 --> 7456.60]  The second good news.
[7457.62 --> 7458.98]  We restocked, baby.
[7459.66 --> 7460.32]  You restocked?
[7460.32 --> 7464.26]  If you're a new LTT Floatplane subscriber, we do a stream every few months where Sarah
[7464.26 --> 7466.40]  designs an exclusive t-shirt live with chat.
[7466.72 --> 7471.18]  This one sold out way faster than we thought it would, so we had to bring them back.
[7471.42 --> 7473.32]  And this time we set one aside for you, Luke.
[7473.38 --> 7474.22]  Check the glove box.
[7474.36 --> 7474.64]  Oh!
[7477.54 --> 7477.86]  Nice!
[7479.86 --> 7480.96]  Oh, wait, there's one for you too.
[7481.44 --> 7481.94]  Oh, nice.
[7482.40 --> 7482.92]  Thank you.
[7483.92 --> 7484.82]  And there's a poster.
[7485.18 --> 7486.06]  Wait, there's two posters.
[7486.30 --> 7487.48]  Okay, there's lots of stuff in there.
[7487.48 --> 7489.30]  I did not know that was happening.
[7489.42 --> 7490.48]  I'm going to put my stuff...
[7490.48 --> 7491.42]  Okay, there we go.
[7492.14 --> 7497.56]  We don't really have a way to show this to you closer, but basically, it's very cool.
[7498.20 --> 7499.30]  Very cool print.
[7500.22 --> 7505.20]  If you want to check out all of the Streams with Sarah collection items here, I'm just going
[7505.20 --> 7506.76]  to show them the digital version of this.
[7506.88 --> 7510.64]  It's lmg.gg slash Streams with Sarah.
[7510.64 --> 7514.14]  And we've got a t-shirt print number three.
[7514.78 --> 7516.36]  How cute is this?
[7516.44 --> 7517.52]  Dorky dinos.
[7517.80 --> 7518.20]  Fantastic.
[7518.88 --> 7520.18]  Ah, it's so cute!
[7520.32 --> 7522.12]  Yeah, I went to go get it and my size was sold out.
[7523.06 --> 7524.96]  And then we've also got our wall art.
[7525.52 --> 7526.80]  Subscribe to LTT on Floatplane.
[7526.90 --> 7529.16]  Sign in to Floatplane to authenticate your account to unlock this item.
[7529.76 --> 7530.52]  Man, that's so cute.
[7530.62 --> 7530.76]  Cool.
[7530.88 --> 7532.16]  Everyone on Floatplane uses Firefox.
[7532.16 --> 7540.08]  That's why there's a legally distinct fox with fire coming off of it on there.
[7540.52 --> 7541.48]  Anyway, guys, check it out.
[7541.98 --> 7545.60]  Also, the last thing on our announcement section is just want to shout out Yvonne's cousin.
[7545.90 --> 7548.84]  I told him I'd mention his new resort on Wansho when I got back home.
[7549.46 --> 7553.62]  Yeah, I was like, oh yeah, yeah, I'll totally talk about it on Wansho when I talk about my
[7553.62 --> 7554.16]  trip to Bali.
[7554.40 --> 7555.98]  And then I just 100% didn't.
[7556.34 --> 7557.64]  So, sorry, Robin.
[7558.42 --> 7558.78]  Yeah.
[7559.48 --> 7560.26]  Lyris Kangoo.
[7560.34 --> 7560.86]  It's super nice.
[7562.16 --> 7562.96]  It looks really nice.
[7563.12 --> 7564.80]  It's super nice.
[7566.20 --> 7567.90]  Some of these photos are wicked.
[7568.10 --> 7569.22]  Wait, did you click the link or something?
[7569.70 --> 7570.06]  Yeah.
[7570.24 --> 7570.74]  Okay, yeah.
[7570.88 --> 7573.58]  So, it's got like a little courtyard here and then these are the units.
[7573.86 --> 7575.28]  Do they have one of the rooftop things?
[7576.70 --> 7579.86]  At least some of the units have their own little pool, which is pretty cool.
[7579.96 --> 7580.62]  Yeah, here's the view.
[7582.04 --> 7582.56]  So, like...
[7582.56 --> 7583.38]  Woo-hoo!
[7584.58 --> 7585.40]  Where is this?
[7588.12 --> 7589.62]  This is in Bali.
[7590.04 --> 7590.32]  Oh.
[7591.28 --> 7591.96]  Yeah, buddy.
[7592.16 --> 7592.30]  Bali.
[7593.50 --> 7595.38]  That's one of the places that I went on my trip.
[7596.06 --> 7597.42]  The island of Bali.
[7598.48 --> 7599.20]  Okay, cool.
[7599.98 --> 7600.46]  Very nice.
[7600.54 --> 7600.92]  That's it.
[7601.36 --> 7602.48]  That's all we have to do.
[7602.78 --> 7604.40]  So, now we've flipped over to After Dark.
[7604.50 --> 7605.14]  No, we haven't.
[7605.16 --> 7605.86]  Your car!
[7606.52 --> 7606.90]  Okay.
[7607.44 --> 7615.00]  Do you remember us talking about a particularly ridiculous car that caught my eye back in the
[7615.00 --> 7615.22]  day?
[7615.22 --> 7618.02]  Are you genuinely asking if I remember or if they remember?
[7618.24 --> 7618.50]  You.
[7618.82 --> 7619.54]  Yes, I do.
[7619.64 --> 7620.14]  You remember.
[7620.26 --> 7620.38]  Okay.
[7620.38 --> 7621.06]  I remember this.
[7621.16 --> 7621.40]  Okay.
[7621.84 --> 7625.38]  So, it's a pretty cool car.
[7625.38 --> 7631.30]  If you're into, you know, soulless EVs that go really fast in a straight line.
[7631.42 --> 7634.04]  And I have no idea what the actual driving dynamics are like.
[7634.04 --> 7641.70]  But it's the Rimac Nevera, which made headlines for being, A, I believe the first, like, actual
[7641.70 --> 7645.50]  production car to go, like, sub two seconds for its zero to 60.
[7646.12 --> 7648.36]  It may not have been the first, but it was certainly one of them.
[7648.40 --> 7653.76]  And it was, like, wild at the time, especially for a completely unheard of company that then
[7653.76 --> 7657.54]  went on to have a stake in Bugatti alongside Porsche.
[7657.94 --> 7659.04]  So, they're doing stuff.
[7659.18 --> 7659.68]  They're moving.
[7659.82 --> 7660.18]  They're shaking.
[7662.50 --> 7669.44]  And also, B, being one of the first, if not the first, hyper car, like, priced over
[7669.44 --> 7672.56]  two million euro that was electric.
[7673.74 --> 7674.12]  Okay.
[7674.12 --> 7681.00]  Now, obviously, that would have been a very silly purchase, especially when, back then,
[7681.14 --> 7686.18]  I had upcoming expenses that were far more important, like buying a testing lab.
[7686.48 --> 7686.58]  Oh.
[7686.98 --> 7687.28]  You know?
[7687.58 --> 7688.04]  Like, yeah.
[7688.62 --> 7690.04]  With money that was...
[7690.04 --> 7691.34]  That's a small price.
[7691.38 --> 7693.06]  With money that was spent on this building.
[7693.16 --> 7693.90]  What do you mean?
[7694.00 --> 7695.12]  I could have bought a car.
[7695.44 --> 7696.60]  You could have bought a bunch of cars.
[7696.62 --> 7699.96]  And those numbers, those numbers are not as far apart as you might think.
[7699.96 --> 7705.66]  Because this building can be purchased with money that is post-corporate income tax.
[7706.42 --> 7710.18]  But I don't have to pay personal tax on because a corporation owns it.
[7710.66 --> 7711.88]  A car...
[7711.88 --> 7714.92]  A corporation cannot own the car that I drive every day.
[7715.64 --> 7717.92]  Otherwise, everybody would use that loophole.
[7717.98 --> 7718.28]  Oh, yeah.
[7718.34 --> 7719.38]  It's a company car.
[7719.38 --> 7721.40]  Well, what do you use it for?
[7722.54 --> 7727.24]  Getting my company groceries to put in my company fridge in my company house.
[7727.36 --> 7727.90]  All of that.
[7727.98 --> 7728.22]  Okay.
[7728.26 --> 7732.02]  Well, where's your personal car and your personal groceries and your personal fridge in your
[7732.02 --> 7732.56]  personal house?
[7732.64 --> 7737.54]  I was going to say, I think we do use a company vehicle to get company groceries sometimes.
[7737.54 --> 7738.32]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7738.38 --> 7738.88]  No, but I mean...
[7738.88 --> 7739.06]  I'm just saying.
[7739.32 --> 7740.68]  Yeah, I just mean if it...
[7740.68 --> 7746.86]  So, that car would have actually cost a lot more because I would have had to draw money
[7746.86 --> 7750.28]  out of the company and pay personal income tax on it in order to purchase that car.
[7750.52 --> 7751.60]  Whereas this building...
[7751.60 --> 7752.02]  Fair enough.
[7752.24 --> 7758.48]  We can buy with just post-corporate income tax money as opposed to with like...
[7758.48 --> 7760.38]  Except I think the building costs a lot more.
[7761.00 --> 7761.50]  It did.
[7761.50 --> 7767.34]  But I'm just saying the car actually costs probably in the neighborhood, all told.
[7767.54 --> 7773.58]  If we talk about like gross profits, like before we pay any taxes or anything, right?
[7773.62 --> 7778.22]  The car probably costs about a quarter what this building did.
[7779.14 --> 7780.16]  A quarter to a third.
[7781.74 --> 7782.22]  Yeah.
[7782.46 --> 7782.64]  Really?
[7782.64 --> 7784.10]  Because you pay so much more tax on the car.
[7784.46 --> 7787.26]  Don't forget, we have luxury tax on cars in British Columbia.
[7788.10 --> 7789.90]  So, how much would it have been then?
[7789.90 --> 7792.30]  Unless you don't want to give those numbers.
[7792.68 --> 7793.24]  Well, no.
[7795.14 --> 7797.30]  So, what's the top tax bracket?
[7797.30 --> 7798.02]  How much was the...
[7798.02 --> 7799.24]  Can you say how much the building was?
[7800.28 --> 7801.34]  I forget.
[7801.68 --> 7803.00]  Because that sounds nuts.
[7803.14 --> 7804.40]  I think the building was a...
[7804.40 --> 7805.20]  I don't know if that's legit.
[7805.26 --> 7805.68]  Oh, crap.
[7805.80 --> 7806.30]  I don't...
[7806.30 --> 7806.64]  Hold on.
[7806.68 --> 7807.26]  I don't remember.
[7807.42 --> 7810.00]  Wait, I'm looking at the current bid price.
[7810.00 --> 7810.52]  So, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[7810.58 --> 7811.36]  Don't look at that yet.
[7811.40 --> 7812.02]  Don't look at that yet.
[7812.08 --> 7812.68]  Don't look at that yet.
[7812.68 --> 7812.82]  Okay.
[7813.06 --> 7818.42]  So, the retail price for the Rimac Nivera, okay, is 2.2 million euro.
[7818.42 --> 7820.00]  Hold on a second.
[7820.86 --> 7823.68]  I don't know if she's going to answer this question, but I'm going to ask her.
[7824.92 --> 7825.16]  Hey.
[7825.34 --> 7825.84]  Hey, lady.
[7825.88 --> 7826.74]  You're live on Wancho.
[7827.38 --> 7827.74]  Hey.
[7828.42 --> 7830.16]  Do you remember how much the lab cost?
[7831.60 --> 7834.02]  I think it was around 10 million.
[7834.68 --> 7835.02]  Okay.
[7835.72 --> 7836.16]  All right.
[7836.20 --> 7836.38]  Cool.
[7837.04 --> 7837.56]  Thanks, lady.
[7838.28 --> 7838.74]  Is that it?
[7838.74 --> 7839.16]  Like, really?
[7839.32 --> 7840.32]  Well, what do you mean, is that it?
[7840.34 --> 7840.70]  No, I'm not.
[7840.78 --> 7841.60]  It's not a pop quiz.
[7841.60 --> 7842.24]  I don't know.
[7842.24 --> 7842.88]  Okay.
[7844.20 --> 7846.78]  I mean, if you want me to look it up, I have a spreadsheet on my computer.
[7846.92 --> 7848.40]  I'm just going off the top of my head right now.
[7849.38 --> 7849.90]  No, no.
[7849.92 --> 7850.24]  It's fine.
[7850.32 --> 7852.22]  If you say it's about that, then it's about that.
[7852.90 --> 7853.14]  Okay.
[7853.28 --> 7854.86]  I mean, you can actually look it up online.
[7855.88 --> 7857.52]  Because was it bought in the last three years?
[7857.56 --> 7860.26]  Because all those recent sales are in the last three years posted online.
[7860.28 --> 7861.24]  You're giving people all the tips.
[7861.98 --> 7862.60]  Oh, sorry.
[7862.94 --> 7863.16]  Okay.
[7863.20 --> 7863.40]  Bye.
[7863.96 --> 7864.24]  Okay.
[7864.24 --> 7864.44]  Bye.
[7864.54 --> 7864.84]  Bye.
[7865.88 --> 7866.28]  Jesus.
[7868.22 --> 7868.82]  Oh, shoot.
[7868.86 --> 7869.90]  I accidentally just called Taryn.
[7870.04 --> 7870.42]  Oh, shoot.
[7870.48 --> 7871.36]  I just locked my phone.
[7871.48 --> 7871.88]  Oh, shoot.
[7871.88 --> 7872.36]  Shoot.
[7872.76 --> 7873.52]  What just happened?
[7874.14 --> 7874.34]  Okay.
[7874.40 --> 7875.44]  No, I uncalled Taryn.
[7875.56 --> 7875.70]  Okay.
[7875.72 --> 7875.98]  It's good.
[7878.12 --> 7879.76]  Anyway, so yeah, that's Yvonne for you.
[7879.86 --> 7881.20]  She knows all the things.
[7882.04 --> 7882.40]  Okay.
[7882.66 --> 7884.70]  So, first of all, that's Canadian dollars.
[7885.18 --> 7887.26]  So, that's about...
[7887.26 --> 7887.62]  What is that?
[7887.68 --> 7888.38]  Oh, shoot.
[7888.96 --> 7889.94]  Taryn's calling me back.
[7892.68 --> 7893.74]  You're live on the WAN show.
[7893.82 --> 7894.18]  Never mind.
[7894.26 --> 7894.92]  I butt-dialed you.
[7895.18 --> 7895.52]  Sort of.
[7896.98 --> 7897.22]  Okay.
[7897.40 --> 7898.64]  I butt-dialed you with my finger.
[7898.80 --> 7898.98]  Okay.
[7899.00 --> 7899.16]  Bye.
[7899.98 --> 7900.32]  Okay.
[7900.54 --> 7900.76]  Bye.
[7901.12 --> 7901.56]  Bye.
[7901.56 --> 7901.92]  Okay.
[7904.34 --> 7904.70]  Ooh.
[7904.82 --> 7907.04]  That sounds a lot dirtier than I meant for it to.
[7907.78 --> 7909.52]  It definitely did.
[7910.44 --> 7910.76]  Anyway.
[7911.12 --> 7911.72]  He played it off well.
[7911.86 --> 7912.74]  I think he noticed.
[7913.26 --> 7913.58]  Yeah.
[7913.74 --> 7914.00]  Okay.
[7914.12 --> 7914.32]  Okay.
[7914.42 --> 7914.64]  Okay.
[7914.64 --> 7916.32]  So, first of all, that's Canadian dollars.
[7916.74 --> 7916.92]  Okay.
[7917.02 --> 7917.80]  Basically, rubles.
[7918.04 --> 7921.04]  So, that's only about seven...
[7921.04 --> 7922.08]  6.5?
[7922.12 --> 7922.28]  Okay.
[7922.56 --> 7924.72]  That's about six and a half million US dollars.
[7924.72 --> 7925.18]  Oh, man.
[7925.20 --> 7925.94]  I was way off.
[7927.12 --> 7927.74]  Oh, to euro.
[7927.84 --> 7928.02]  Okay.
[7928.06 --> 7928.54]  The other...
[7928.54 --> 7930.20]  The Romero was in...
[7930.20 --> 7930.44]  No, no.
[7930.46 --> 7930.66]  Hold on.
[7930.70 --> 7931.04]  We'll get there.
[7931.08 --> 7931.42]  We'll get there.
[7931.54 --> 7931.74]  We'll get there.
[7932.04 --> 7932.26]  Okay.
[7932.32 --> 7934.02]  So, 10 million USD to CAD.
[7934.66 --> 7935.04]  Hold on.
[7935.08 --> 7935.34]  Hold on.
[7935.88 --> 7935.98]  Oh.
[7936.22 --> 7936.36]  Oh.
[7936.78 --> 7937.12]  Dang it.
[7937.18 --> 7939.82]  10 million CAD to USD.
[7939.92 --> 7940.68]  So, it's about seven million?
[7941.02 --> 7941.78]  About seven million.
[7941.84 --> 7943.18]  About seven million US dollars.
[7943.50 --> 7943.70]  Okay.
[7944.68 --> 7948.20]  So, that car is 2.2 million euro.
[7948.42 --> 7949.48]  So, what does that work out to, Dan?
[7952.20 --> 7954.40]  About three and a half million Canadian dollars.
[7954.60 --> 7956.70]  But you just converted the other one to...
[7956.70 --> 7957.74]  Don't worry about it.
[7957.74 --> 7957.84]  USD.
[7958.06 --> 7958.50]  Oh, right.
[7959.00 --> 7959.36]  Well, no.
[7959.38 --> 7960.66]  It's the whole point of the conversation.
[7961.54 --> 7962.60]  Two and a half USD.
[7962.84 --> 7963.06]  Okay.
[7963.26 --> 7965.38]  So, the car is two and a half million USD.
[7965.38 --> 7967.94]  The building is seven million USD.
[7968.38 --> 7968.62]  Okay.
[7968.62 --> 7973.04]  So, already, it's over a third of the price of the building.
[7973.26 --> 7974.84]  So, you're going to make up two thirds in taxes?
[7975.08 --> 7976.98]  And that's before I...
[7976.98 --> 7977.94]  Oh, dude.
[7978.14 --> 7978.46]  Easy.
[7978.92 --> 7981.84]  Have you seen the highest tax bracket in BC?
[7982.46 --> 7982.96]  Yes.
[7986.44 --> 7989.44]  Highest tax bracket BC.
[7990.28 --> 7993.16]  So, it is 53.5%.
[7993.16 --> 7998.66]  So, I don't pay all of that if I take out a dividend.
[7999.62 --> 8005.58]  I pay only approximately what remains after the company paid corporate tax.
[8006.10 --> 8006.34]  Right?
[8006.42 --> 8011.00]  Because if the company paid me on the payroll, then that's a business expense.
[8011.00 --> 8012.54]  It pays zero tax.
[8012.54 --> 8015.14]  And I pay 53.5%.
[8015.14 --> 8029.36]  If the company takes that as profit and then just issues a dividend rather than paying me as part of my salary or part of my wages, then the way the government figured out the math is to make it so that it works out about the same.
[8029.36 --> 8031.64]  So, it's not more efficient one way.
[8031.64 --> 8036.32]  It used to be more efficient to not pay yourself a salary and to pay yourself a dividend like ages and ages ago.
[8036.60 --> 8039.34]  But by the time we started a business, it just didn't really matter.
[8039.52 --> 8039.64]  Yeah.
[8039.96 --> 8043.22]  So, I think the corporate tax rate is like 20-something percent.
[8043.46 --> 8045.92]  So, I would pay like another 33%.
[8045.92 --> 8053.20]  So, we could say that my additional tax on that car would be about 33% compared to buying a building.
[8053.96 --> 8055.16]  So, Dan, what does that work out to?
[8055.22 --> 8058.14]  2.5 million plus 33%.
[8059.36 --> 8064.60]  I can hear him typing.
[8064.70 --> 8065.04]  He's got it.
[8065.30 --> 8065.48]  Yeah.
[8070.26 --> 8071.38]  3.3 million.
[8071.76 --> 8072.02]  Okay.
[8072.26 --> 8074.20]  Now, let's talk about the luxury tax.
[8076.52 --> 8078.52]  What's the luxury tax on a vehicle in BC?
[8079.56 --> 8083.08]  So, it is 12%, 7%.
[8083.08 --> 8083.32]  Okay.
[8083.42 --> 8087.98]  The cost of tax on vehicles, to avoid the luxury tax, you need to purchase a vehicle under $55,000.
[8087.98 --> 8088.30]  Yeah.
[8088.42 --> 8088.90]  I'm not.
[8089.18 --> 8090.82]  No, I want to know how much it is.
[8091.82 --> 8093.04]  I don't know how you're going to make a gap.
[8093.04 --> 8104.52]  The luxury tax is equal to the lesser of 10% of the taxable amount of the subject vehicle and 20% of the amount above the price threshold.
[8104.64 --> 8106.54]  So, I believe the price threshold is about $100,000.
[8107.22 --> 8112.52]  So, let's call it $2.4 million.
[8113.38 --> 8114.58]  20% of that.
[8114.58 --> 8116.54]  So, another half a mil.
[8118.00 --> 8119.16]  You're still not there, though.
[8119.30 --> 8119.96]  I am still there.
[8120.02 --> 8121.90]  That's over half the price of the building.
[8123.04 --> 8124.04]  Didn't you say, okay.
[8124.60 --> 8124.86]  Yeah.
[8125.02 --> 8126.36]  I might have thought you said someone else.
[8126.44 --> 8127.82]  So, I could literally...
[8127.82 --> 8130.10]  I thought you said the car was more expensive than the building.
[8130.20 --> 8130.86]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8130.86 --> 8131.18]  Okay.
[8131.54 --> 8132.00]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8132.00 --> 8133.30]  That's why I was like, what are you talking about?
[8133.30 --> 8133.86]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8133.86 --> 8134.84]  I must have just heard you wrong.
[8134.90 --> 8135.46]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8135.46 --> 8154.34]  So, that car, in terms of money that came into the company that was not paid out in expenses, would cost over half as much as the building that we have this fire truck parked in that has a fire truck in it.
[8155.66 --> 8157.14]  Including the fire truck.
[8157.86 --> 8158.38]  Oh, yeah.
[8158.46 --> 8159.90]  The fire truck has three fire trucks in it.
[8160.02 --> 8160.28]  Okay.
[8160.28 --> 8176.96]  So, aside from it just being stupid, one of the points that was brought up by you, by Jake Tyvee, by the audience, was that they didn't think that these Nevaras were going to appreciate like many hypercars do.
[8177.14 --> 8177.26]  Yep.
[8177.38 --> 8181.34]  A lot of the time, hypercars is like, it's a whole thing, right?
[8181.34 --> 8181.80]  It's an investment.
[8181.80 --> 8194.90]  Where if you're one of the people who's on the list where you're allowed to buy the super limited run ones, that's a huge benefit to you because you could, like, drive it for a year, play around with it, and then sell it for double what you paid.
[8195.32 --> 8199.16]  Because these things appreciate, like, crazy if they're super collectible.
[8199.16 --> 8201.64]  So, this is an auction.
[8202.12 --> 8203.24]  Finally, we're getting to it.
[8203.42 --> 8209.18]  That I came across for a 2023 Remak-Nevera that showed up in my Google News feed.
[8210.28 --> 8216.72]  Like the old, sorry, just to cut you off, the old Ford GTs, for instance, like, oh my god, they are worth so much money.
[8216.72 --> 8222.26]  That was bid to just 1.27 million US dollars.
[8222.44 --> 8224.58]  Do you have to pay luxury tax on that because it's used?
[8224.70 --> 8224.90]  Yes.
[8225.22 --> 8225.54]  Oh.
[8225.54 --> 8228.06]  Still have to pay luxury tax on used vehicles, I believe.
[8228.20 --> 8228.40]  Okay.
[8229.32 --> 8232.08]  This thing is almost brand new.
[8232.36 --> 8234.90]  It has 1,300 miles on it.
[8235.04 --> 8235.66]  What?
[8236.14 --> 8237.40]  I didn't see that.
[8237.56 --> 8239.04]  It is basically untouched.
[8239.26 --> 8239.48]  Wow.
[8239.92 --> 8242.28]  It is absolutely immaculate.
[8242.78 --> 8246.12]  It is pretty much brand new.
[8246.30 --> 8255.14]  It has the exposed carbon fiber trim option, which is apparently an 80,000 euro option.
[8255.54 --> 8259.06]  It has a 20,000 euro paint job.
[8259.06 --> 8271.08]  So this was a 2.3 million euro car and is now worth, at least on bringatrailer.com, less than half of what the owner paid for it.
[8271.58 --> 8273.88]  That is brutal.
[8273.88 --> 8278.30]  Now, it didn't meet reserve.
[8278.68 --> 8281.14]  It didn't actually sell, I believe.
[8281.92 --> 8282.76]  Hold on a second.
[8283.20 --> 8283.64]  Hold on.
[8283.70 --> 8284.48]  Control F.
[8285.16 --> 8285.60]  Reserve.
[8287.66 --> 8288.14]  Hello?
[8288.38 --> 8288.96]  Is it searching?
[8289.26 --> 8289.92]  Control F.
[8290.48 --> 8291.04]  There we go.
[8291.74 --> 8292.02]  Reserve.
[8292.12 --> 8292.28]  Yeah.
[8292.50 --> 8294.62]  Reserve not met on this car.
[8294.62 --> 8297.06]  22 bids.
[8297.84 --> 8298.20]  Dude.
[8299.24 --> 8308.56]  How happy am I that I bought a building that has depreciated by probably a solid 25% instead of a car that depreciated by 50%?
[8308.92 --> 8313.32]  And to be clear, to be clear, I'm not concerned about the building depreciation.
[8313.40 --> 8315.00]  It has depreciated a fair bit.
[8315.10 --> 8318.00]  The housing market in Vancouver is finally correcting.
[8318.36 --> 8318.62]  Thank goodness.
[8318.62 --> 8321.08]  The industrial market is finally correcting.
[8321.38 --> 8321.92]  Thank goodness.
[8322.02 --> 8327.92]  Even as somebody with a disproportionate amount of my net worth tied up in real estate, I am rooting for it.
[8328.02 --> 8329.00]  I am here for it.
[8329.28 --> 8331.98]  I have friends who can't afford to live.
[8334.34 --> 8335.46]  It's not good.
[8335.98 --> 8340.70]  It has been for a long time and currently is very brutal trying to hire here.
[8340.94 --> 8342.78]  It is bad for our company.
[8342.78 --> 8346.74]  It is bad for our society for housing to be this expensive.
[8346.74 --> 8352.58]  I am 100% rooting for the housing market to massively correct here.
[8353.54 --> 8355.32]  So I'm not upset about it.
[8355.72 --> 8366.54]  And realistically, when you're an owner-operator, when you occupy your own property, the calculus is totally different because we are using this building to make money.
[8366.68 --> 8368.36]  I don't need the asset to appreciate.
[8368.48 --> 8370.20]  I'm not speculating on property here.
[8371.46 --> 8374.72]  Anyway, the point is I'm really glad I didn't buy that car.
[8374.72 --> 8379.36]  That is what that whole conversation was leading to.
[8379.52 --> 8380.10]  Me too.
[8380.26 --> 8381.06]  And you know what?
[8381.12 --> 8384.18]  I did buy a car that's probably depreciated by half.
[8384.58 --> 8384.90]  Sure.
[8385.18 --> 8386.94]  My Taycan is...
[8386.94 --> 8388.96]  I mean, here, we can find out, actually.
[8389.26 --> 8389.90]  Yeah, we can find out.
[8390.04 --> 8392.58]  I did at least get a deal on it because I didn't pay luxury tax.
[8392.60 --> 8393.22]  It was used.
[8393.42 --> 8398.04]  Oh, actually, the luxury tax and PST doesn't apply to used EVs.
[8398.20 --> 8400.48]  They're getting rid of that exemption, though, at the end of this month.
[8400.98 --> 8402.40]  Well, it would have been a good time to buy a Navara.
[8402.40 --> 8403.04]  No.
[8405.34 --> 8406.62]  No luxury tax, no PST.
[8406.74 --> 8407.04]  Let's go.
[8407.10 --> 8407.82]  $1.2 million.
[8407.98 --> 8408.52]  Half price.
[8408.66 --> 8408.88]  No.
[8409.00 --> 8409.90]  50% off, baby.
[8409.98 --> 8415.74]  Anyway, the point is that I did end up buying a car that's probably worth half of what I paid for it,
[8415.98 --> 8417.46]  although I did at least get a deal.
[8418.60 --> 8426.08]  But it lost a lot less in, like, actual dollars than that stupid thing would have.
[8426.08 --> 8430.96]  You know what I've been having trouble figuring out is what the heck do people actually do with these cars?
[8432.40 --> 8433.24]  Park them.
[8434.46 --> 8435.50]  Well, yeah, apparently.
[8435.64 --> 8438.12]  Drive them to a car meetup.
[8438.12 --> 8441.08]  Like, a few times a year.
[8441.30 --> 8444.60]  Because, like, if I had something like that, it's only two seats.
[8444.72 --> 8446.94]  I can't take anybody anywhere in it.
[8447.10 --> 8448.68]  The maintenance on them is insane.
[8448.72 --> 8450.66]  I'd be terrified to park it somewhere.
[8451.20 --> 8451.60]  Yep.
[8451.82 --> 8452.90]  Like, terrified.
[8453.06 --> 8455.04]  This is a single rock.
[8455.46 --> 8457.58]  Precisely why I said you shouldn't have bought one in the first place.
[8457.58 --> 8462.96]  I do remember having a conversation about saying, like, if it was at least an ICE car, those tend to...
[8462.96 --> 8463.18]  Yeah.
[8463.74 --> 8467.12]  There is some interesting investment strategies and stuff you can do there.
[8467.32 --> 8468.94]  I'm not knowledgeable enough to do that.
[8468.98 --> 8469.68]  I'm not a car guy.
[8469.96 --> 8472.00]  I don't, like, know what the sexy good one is.
[8472.04 --> 8472.58]  So, like, whatever.
[8472.74 --> 8472.84]  Yeah.
[8473.84 --> 8474.96]  But it wasn't.
[8475.06 --> 8475.36]  It was an EV.
[8475.50 --> 8476.92]  So, it's, like, definitely a drop in price.
[8477.14 --> 8478.44]  And there's all these other issues.
[8478.74 --> 8481.88]  But it's also just, like, what's the point?
[8482.02 --> 8482.84]  It's like buying...
[8483.48 --> 8485.70]  And I'm going to offend some people here.
[8485.86 --> 8490.58]  But it's like buying, like, an old console that you just leave in the box.
[8491.54 --> 8492.04]  Oh, yeah.
[8492.52 --> 8498.26]  He is not into buying something just to keep it new in box so that you can flip it later.
[8498.38 --> 8503.10]  It was, like, some things are, you know, they're basically art.
[8503.52 --> 8507.70]  Like, I could say that it makes more sense to me for, like, a Funko Pop thing to stay in the box.
[8508.42 --> 8510.44]  Because you're just supposed to look at it anyways.
[8510.56 --> 8513.00]  But, like, a thing that was made to do stuff.
[8513.90 --> 8516.06]  Like, in my mind, the car wants to go.
[8516.62 --> 8518.88]  Would you say this is just, like, a rich person's Funko Pop?
[8518.88 --> 8520.38]  I guess.
[8520.54 --> 8521.38]  I mean...
[8521.38 --> 8522.24]  So depressing.
[8522.66 --> 8523.06]  Hold on.
[8523.18 --> 8523.66]  Where's...
[8523.66 --> 8524.38]  Damn it, Dan.
[8524.72 --> 8525.88]  Luke's new at this, isn't he?
[8527.16 --> 8533.14]  Wafer says, people that buy Rumax literally just hold them in a larger collection of cars and drive them very rarely.
[8533.64 --> 8539.62]  Well, hopefully they plan to hold them for either a lot longer or they plan to get out of them immediately.
[8539.62 --> 8543.14]  Because it seems like they are depreciating hard.
[8543.62 --> 8545.56]  Corey G said, no, it doesn't have a box.
[8545.56 --> 8550.08]  Yeah, this is a bring-your-own-box scenario where you build your own garage for it.
[8550.10 --> 8551.48]  At least my firetruck had a box.
[8551.96 --> 8552.84]  Yeah, that's true.
[8553.26 --> 8553.66]  Kind of.
[8553.74 --> 8554.32]  It had a wall.
[8554.90 --> 8555.16]  Yeah.
[8555.38 --> 8556.04]  Well, look.
[8556.50 --> 8556.84]  Okay?
[8557.24 --> 8559.26]  That's a box on a budget.
[8559.94 --> 8561.64]  That's what I call it.
[8561.92 --> 8562.70]  That worked up, man.
[8562.74 --> 8563.74]  We had one take at that.
[8563.80 --> 8567.12]  I saw the full-plane exclusive part for that.
[8567.16 --> 8567.96]  That was wild.
[8568.34 --> 8569.04]  Good job.
[8569.48 --> 8569.72]  Yeah.
[8569.72 --> 8571.36]  I had one shot.
[8571.42 --> 8573.08]  It actually hit me in the arm on the way down.
[8573.32 --> 8575.78]  If you look really closely, it grazed me.
[8576.20 --> 8576.62]  Oh, really?
[8576.70 --> 8578.32]  Dude, I was trying to get out of the freaking way.
[8578.50 --> 8579.84]  I saw you kind of booking it.
[8579.96 --> 8580.22]  Yeah.
[8580.40 --> 8580.70]  Yeah.
[8580.94 --> 8581.68]  Like, I was moving.
[8581.74 --> 8582.24]  It was coming.
[8582.42 --> 8584.38]  You kicked the supports, right?
[8584.46 --> 8584.66]  Yeah.
[8584.92 --> 8587.14]  The second I saw you kick it, I was like, oh.
[8587.28 --> 8588.52]  I just thought it'd be really cool.
[8588.52 --> 8591.72]  I assumed it was going to be like a rope or something that you were pulling so you could keep moving.
[8592.00 --> 8594.00]  But you had to kick it, which interrupts your forward-
[8594.00 --> 8594.88]  Yeah, because it was windy.
[8594.98 --> 8596.42]  We couldn't get it to stand on its own.
[8596.74 --> 8597.42]  It's wild.
[8597.52 --> 8598.60]  So we had to prop it up.
[8598.60 --> 8599.36]  I was pretty surprised.
[8599.64 --> 8602.14]  I saw that in the actual video.
[8602.40 --> 8603.62]  I wasn't out there.
[8603.82 --> 8605.22]  I'm saying this for them, you know.
[8606.34 --> 8606.90]  But yeah, it was wild.
[8607.14 --> 8608.34]  The intro to WAN today.
[8608.86 --> 8611.12]  I'm excited to go watch it because I have no idea.
[8611.86 --> 8612.22]  Oh, dude.
[8612.32 --> 8616.32]  I was watching it on Dan's monitor when we did the dry run.
[8616.40 --> 8616.92]  No, no, no, no.
[8616.92 --> 8618.50]  Our live version.
[8619.04 --> 8619.22]  Oh.
[8620.28 --> 8627.78]  Because for you guys, if you tuned in after the beginning of the show, there's a video clip of us getting ready
[8627.78 --> 8628.96]  that was pre-recorded.
[8628.96 --> 8634.54]  But then when the show cuts to live and we're not in the fire truck, we're upstairs.
[8634.88 --> 8635.16]  Yeah.
[8635.32 --> 8639.24]  And we both jump on a fire pole, slide down and like run into the truck.
[8639.38 --> 8640.16]  Yeah, we did it live.
[8640.32 --> 8641.20]  And that was all live.
[8641.28 --> 8641.46]  Yeah.
[8641.62 --> 8642.82]  I did fumble it slightly.
[8643.24 --> 8643.72]  Oh, did you?
[8643.82 --> 8644.14]  Yeah.
[8644.32 --> 8644.64]  Unfortunately.
[8644.64 --> 8645.40]  I'm sorry, guys.
[8645.50 --> 8646.02]  What'd you do?
[8646.02 --> 8646.24]  What's the part?
[8647.10 --> 8649.04]  Just the transition into the truck.
[8649.62 --> 8650.54]  Oh, no, I saw it.
[8650.58 --> 8650.96]  It was fine.
[8651.14 --> 8652.14]  I feel really good at work.
[8652.14 --> 8653.70]  I was watching the monitor when you did it.
[8653.78 --> 8653.88]  I thought it was fine.
[8653.88 --> 8656.04]  I noticed, yeah, there was some other video up or something.
[8656.48 --> 8656.86]  Is that right?
[8656.94 --> 8657.96]  Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[8658.60 --> 8660.50]  But yeah, it looped back into the video.
[8660.76 --> 8662.58]  As long as people saw us coming down the pole.
[8662.68 --> 8663.54]  Oh, yeah, that was all fine.
[8663.62 --> 8663.74]  Yeah.
[8663.88 --> 8665.04]  Just the transition at the truck.
[8665.52 --> 8665.88]  Sad.
[8666.22 --> 8667.98]  They were saying, is the fire pole permanent now?
[8668.48 --> 8668.76]  No.
[8668.76 --> 8670.48]  I'm assuming no liability problems.
[8670.54 --> 8671.26]  That's a big no.
[8671.58 --> 8671.84]  Yeah.
[8672.36 --> 8673.52]  My kids want to go on it.
[8673.58 --> 8677.08]  I will maybe allow my son to try it because he's pretty athletic.
[8677.32 --> 8679.84]  But there's no way the other ones are allowed to go on it.
[8679.86 --> 8680.68]  It's really far.
[8681.20 --> 8682.24]  You have to jump onto it.
[8682.24 --> 8683.12]  That was surprising.
[8683.90 --> 8684.98]  Why isn't it closer?
[8685.12 --> 8685.52]  I don't know.
[8685.64 --> 8688.82]  If you look at the supports along the ceiling.
[8689.36 --> 8690.88]  Oh, it lines up with one of those.
[8690.96 --> 8691.60]  That makes a lot of sense.
[8691.60 --> 8693.12]  Yeah, that was the safest place to do it.
[8693.14 --> 8694.56]  There was nowhere else to tie it to.
[8694.92 --> 8695.40]  Got it.
[8696.68 --> 8701.36]  It's hilarious that as often as we've said, we're never going to have a fire pole.
[8701.36 --> 8703.82]  How many times we have actually installed one?
[8703.90 --> 8704.78]  At least two now.
[8704.94 --> 8705.16]  Yeah.
[8706.66 --> 8707.02]  Hilarious.
[8709.12 --> 8710.80]  I don't even remember how that meme started.
[8713.38 --> 8715.56]  I know when it started, but I don't remember why.
[8715.72 --> 8718.76]  Oh, when we were moving into the office.
[8719.02 --> 8719.76]  Yeah, but what?
[8720.18 --> 8721.50]  You were just like, we should have a fire pole.
[8721.62 --> 8722.36]  And I was like, no.
[8722.54 --> 8723.04]  That's stupid.
[8724.10 --> 8724.92]  That's how it started.
[8726.04 --> 8729.04]  That sounds simple enough for it to be correct.
[8729.04 --> 8731.36]  All right.
[8731.66 --> 8732.02]  Dan.
[8733.18 --> 8733.54]  Yes.
[8733.66 --> 8734.50]  It's time for After Dark.
[8734.68 --> 8735.00]  All right.
[8735.02 --> 8736.74]  I have to come and change those lights over.
[8736.94 --> 8737.16]  Oh.
[8737.90 --> 8738.30]  Oh.
[8738.80 --> 8739.12]  What?
[8739.58 --> 8740.32]  You have to come down.
[8740.46 --> 8741.30]  Can we go to Dan camp?
[8741.38 --> 8741.70]  Oh, yeah.
[8742.18 --> 8742.66]  There we go.
[8743.30 --> 8744.80]  You have to actually come down here.
[8745.04 --> 8745.84]  There are Titan tubes.
[8746.68 --> 8747.94]  Are you using a lap board?
[8748.10 --> 8749.30]  Oh, I was.
[8750.86 --> 8752.10]  Did that fall off the truck?
[8752.20 --> 8752.48]  No.
[8752.96 --> 8753.20]  Okay.
[8753.32 --> 8753.92]  It might plant.
[8753.92 --> 8754.28]  No, no.
[8754.32 --> 8756.78]  He's in the middle of like the flat part of the back.
[8756.84 --> 8756.96]  Yeah.
[8757.02 --> 8759.22]  I saw him put it off on the side, so I wasn't sure.
[8759.26 --> 8759.82]  Oh, jeez.
[8760.08 --> 8760.60]  My goodness.
[8760.62 --> 8763.06]  Can you guys see the truck moving as he like walks around up there?
[8763.40 --> 8765.22]  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to pick it up.
[8765.62 --> 8768.08]  The audio of like the water bottle falling and stuff.
[8768.16 --> 8769.04]  This sounds like Foley.
[8769.32 --> 8769.56]  Oh, yeah.
[8769.58 --> 8770.54]  I'm going to fix my water bottle.
[8770.54 --> 8772.02]  People have been asking me to deal with this.
[8772.70 --> 8773.52]  What's going on?
[8775.00 --> 8775.42]  Oh.
[8775.42 --> 8775.50]  Oh.
[8778.12 --> 8779.10]  Don't die, Dan.
[8779.54 --> 8779.90]  There.
[8780.00 --> 8780.20]  Sorry.
[8780.70 --> 8784.52]  Man, the like suspension on my seat is so nice.
[8784.62 --> 8784.82]  Yeah.
[8785.32 --> 8785.64]  Oh, wait.
[8785.86 --> 8785.88]  What?
[8785.96 --> 8786.90]  No, I got more bounce.
[8786.96 --> 8787.48]  I'm the driver.
[8789.36 --> 8789.76]  Yeah.
[8790.08 --> 8790.44]  Okay.
[8790.56 --> 8791.48]  So, Dan, where?
[8791.72 --> 8792.06]  Sorry.
[8792.18 --> 8793.24]  Where is he right now?
[8793.28 --> 8793.82]  Hold on a second.
[8794.16 --> 8795.06]  Are you behind us?
[8795.42 --> 8795.92]  Are you in the?
[8796.10 --> 8796.70]  Oh, okay.
[8796.70 --> 8797.58]  You're in the ride along.
[8797.66 --> 8798.24]  There he is.
[8798.66 --> 8798.90]  Compartment.
[8803.24 --> 8804.12]  I don't know, man.
[8804.20 --> 8804.34]  Huh?
[8806.08 --> 8807.58]  We don't know what you're doing, sir.
[8807.74 --> 8807.96]  Yeah.
[8808.66 --> 8809.80]  I want to make them magenta.
[8810.06 --> 8811.90]  He wants to make them magenta, apparently.
[8812.06 --> 8812.66]  They're kind of.
[8812.96 --> 8813.96]  I mean, there's something.
[8814.08 --> 8816.00]  Bluey, purpley kind of deal going on.
[8816.82 --> 8817.10]  Okay.
[8817.14 --> 8818.08]  It's after dark enough.
[8818.22 --> 8820.10]  He says, whatever, I don't care.
[8820.72 --> 8821.98]  And he's leaving now.
[8821.98 --> 8822.58]  I'm trying to say the line bar.
[8826.70 --> 8827.30]  I'm over.
[8827.50 --> 8828.08]  Go back to the.
[8828.08 --> 8828.38]  I'm over.
[8828.38 --> 8828.58]  Yeah.
[8830.78 --> 8832.92]  I got jump scared by Dan coming to the window.
[8832.92 --> 8835.14]  All right.
[8835.18 --> 8835.72]  Here he goes.
[8839.72 --> 8841.20]  The whole truck shakes again.
[8841.30 --> 8842.04]  Oh, man.
[8842.44 --> 8844.30]  What even is my end show?
[8845.12 --> 8846.66]  Some days I'm really not sure.
[8848.32 --> 8849.80]  Today is one of those days.
[8851.02 --> 8852.28]  Just dudes doing stuff.
[8852.52 --> 8852.86]  Yeah.
[8853.38 --> 8855.08]  Just hanging out in their fire truck.
[8855.36 --> 8855.62]  Yeah.
[8856.06 --> 8856.38]  Yeah.
[8856.38 --> 8863.20]  Did you enjoy getting down the fire pole?
[8863.42 --> 8863.62]  Yeah.
[8863.96 --> 8864.32]  Yeah.
[8864.60 --> 8865.14]  Yeah, it was fun.
[8865.34 --> 8865.50]  Yeah.
[8865.90 --> 8870.70]  We did it like, I think it was like four times or something trying to shoot for the intro
[8870.70 --> 8871.06]  video.
[8871.16 --> 8874.86]  And then after we did it all those times, I was like, hey, we should actually just do it
[8874.86 --> 8875.38]  live instead.
[8876.34 --> 8878.80]  I was surprised you guys were even going to do it during the dry runs.
[8879.72 --> 8880.00]  Yeah.
[8880.08 --> 8880.30]  Why not?
[8880.34 --> 8880.58]  I don't know.
[8880.58 --> 8880.92]  It was fun.
[8881.02 --> 8881.26]  Yeah.
[8881.26 --> 8881.52]  Yeah.
[8881.96 --> 8882.74]  I would have kept doing it.
[8882.82 --> 8884.42]  We're both reasonably well coordinated.
[8884.42 --> 8887.58]  I was, there is a trip hazard right in front of the pole.
[8887.68 --> 8888.72]  A pretty rough one, actually.
[8888.94 --> 8891.20]  It's like actually really like a two stage trip hazard.
[8891.42 --> 8891.62]  Yeah.
[8891.84 --> 8893.00]  Like right at the edge.
[8894.50 --> 8895.60]  You know, it's there.
[8897.68 --> 8903.36]  But realistically, like I just had Luke start with his foot on the second of the trip hazard.
[8903.46 --> 8906.26]  So he was just like, he just kind of leaned in and launched over.
[8906.50 --> 8908.82]  And then, you know, if I die, what am I going to do?
[8908.88 --> 8909.38]  Sue the company?
[8909.64 --> 8911.72]  Like, I mean, the, maybe I shouldn't tell you this.
[8911.76 --> 8912.10]  Maybe I should.
[8912.18 --> 8912.40]  I don't know.
[8912.42 --> 8912.64]  Whatever.
[8912.64 --> 8918.06]  The, the ones we did for the recorded version, I definitely wasn't like pre-stepped.
[8918.86 --> 8919.82]  It was fine.
[8920.06 --> 8920.46]  All right.
[8920.56 --> 8921.10]  It was fine.
[8921.40 --> 8926.34]  My only concern today was that I was going to, I'm wearing the like prop fireman pants.
[8926.74 --> 8927.14]  Yeah.
[8927.22 --> 8928.46]  And they started to rip.
[8928.50 --> 8930.42]  And I was like, if I go again, they're gone.
[8930.52 --> 8930.72]  Oh yeah.
[8930.72 --> 8934.10]  The crotch is like obliterated on those pants.
[8934.20 --> 8934.46]  Yeah.
[8934.72 --> 8935.12]  Love it.
[8935.16 --> 8936.48]  I can probably show the camera.
[8936.56 --> 8938.54]  You're ready for the, you're ready for the calendar shoot.
[8938.54 --> 8942.16]  Oh wait, are you guys doing another one?
[8942.42 --> 8943.24]  What do you mean another one?
[8943.32 --> 8945.60]  That we have, we haven't even done the calendar.
[8945.68 --> 8946.66]  Oh, I thought you did one.
[8946.66 --> 8948.54]  No, we're going to do a 2026 calendar.
[8948.92 --> 8949.16]  Oh.
[8949.16 --> 8952.66]  So that gives us time to, I've, you know, I've wanted to do this for like 10 years.
[8952.66 --> 8952.84]  Yeah.
[8952.84 --> 8953.02]  Yeah.
[8953.02 --> 8953.22]  Yeah.
[8953.22 --> 8953.32]  Yeah.
[8953.32 --> 8953.34]  Yeah.
[8953.34 --> 8953.42]  Yeah.
[8953.42 --> 8955.66]  Like a men of tech, like fireman calendar.
[8955.76 --> 8955.96]  Yeah.
[8955.96 --> 8956.02]  Yeah.
[8956.02 --> 8957.90]  So I, I, I, I'm, I'm serious.
[8957.90 --> 8962.80]  That's the April fool's joke is that everything is a hundred percent serious.
[8963.40 --> 8964.06]  Crotch cam.
[8964.30 --> 8964.52]  I don't know.
[8964.52 --> 8965.22]  I'm wearing shorts.
[8965.32 --> 8966.14]  I could show people.
[8967.18 --> 8967.92]  Oh my God.
[8969.04 --> 8971.90]  All right, Dan, do you want to give us some, there it is.
[8978.48 --> 8980.26]  That's for the internal calendar.
[8982.46 --> 8983.44]  It's just shorts.
[8984.66 --> 8986.84]  I'm wearing like four layers down there right now.
[8987.08 --> 8987.88]  Three, three layers.
[8988.76 --> 8989.50]  It's fine.
[8991.52 --> 8994.10]  All right, Dan, do you want to hit us with some merch messages?
[8994.36 --> 8994.58]  I'm sorry.
[8994.64 --> 8995.66]  I didn't have a sensor ready.
[8996.72 --> 8997.68]  Hello, LTT.
[9001.14 --> 9002.44]  I was red as the firetruck.
[9002.82 --> 9003.38]  Hello, LTT.
[9003.82 --> 9008.92]  I was wondering if you put a pack of unopened Pokemon cards in the Luma field CT scanner.
[9009.34 --> 9011.36]  Are you able to see the cards inside?
[9012.32 --> 9012.84]  Would be cool.
[9013.06 --> 9014.24]  I think we tested this.
[9014.70 --> 9014.84]  I don't believe so.
[9014.84 --> 9017.52]  I don't think there's enough resolution to make it out.
[9017.52 --> 9033.38]  However, I believe there is someone who used some kind of CT scanner and used some kind of machine vision, machine learning assistance to, yes, be able to tell what was inside a pack of Pokemon cards.
[9033.38 --> 9046.82]  I remember the news breaking and then there being some speculation that this would completely destroy the Pokemon card economy to which I said, good, because it's gambling for children.
[9046.82 --> 9048.08]  This is actually terrible.
[9048.08 --> 9050.16]  And then nothing more came of it.
[9050.20 --> 9051.68]  It's kind of like the Panama Papers that way.
[9052.10 --> 9053.36]  Like it was huge news.
[9053.50 --> 9053.94]  And then.
[9055.10 --> 9055.58]  Yeah.
[9055.74 --> 9058.98]  And like Epstein not killing himself and all those things.
[9059.78 --> 9060.30]  Yeah.
[9060.30 --> 9064.72]  Dude, I don't, I don't, I don't conspiracy theory much.
[9066.34 --> 9068.18]  I don't even know if that like, is that like.
[9069.80 --> 9072.06]  When faced with overwhelming facts.
[9073.26 --> 9074.76]  I'm supposed to believe that.
[9076.38 --> 9077.22]  I don't know.
[9077.28 --> 9078.36]  Dude, come on.
[9078.62 --> 9079.08]  Yeah.
[9079.48 --> 9080.30]  Come on.
[9080.30 --> 9090.28]  If a, if a journalist can get car bombed after the Panama Papers, Epstein can definitely get unalived.
[9090.52 --> 9090.92]  Yeah.
[9091.12 --> 9091.60]  Um.
[9092.76 --> 9093.92]  For what he knew.
[9094.74 --> 9095.82]  The amount of like.
[9097.26 --> 9097.98]  I don't know.
[9099.14 --> 9101.12]  I don't, I don't, I just, I don't remember all the details.
[9101.14 --> 9102.48]  How off the rails are we going today, Luke?
[9102.56 --> 9103.24]  I don't remember all the details.
[9103.24 --> 9105.28]  Is it after dark at the, at the fire hall?
[9106.68 --> 9109.66]  We should have like turned these lights off and just left the red one.
[9109.66 --> 9109.90]  Yeah.
[9109.90 --> 9110.86]  Hot take emergency.
[9111.26 --> 9116.40]  Um, but yeah, I, I, it's, it's tough because like, I remember reading all the details of
[9116.40 --> 9118.78]  like, I don't know, some guard was supposed to be there and they weren't.
[9118.82 --> 9120.64]  And some other thing was supposed to happen and it didn't.
[9120.74 --> 9124.36]  And video cameras and surveillance wasn't working or something or other, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[9124.40 --> 9124.52]  blah.
[9125.00 --> 9129.20]  Uh, but I don't know.
[9129.28 --> 9133.90]  You hear this stuff happening at big companies where like something fails and you're like,
[9133.92 --> 9135.10]  how did that possibly happen?
[9135.26 --> 9139.64]  And then something happens here and it's like, oh, like every week.
[9139.66 --> 9141.96]  The procedure step was skipped for whatever reason.
[9142.42 --> 9144.82]  This just happens at companies, I guess.
[9144.96 --> 9145.26]  Okay.
[9146.44 --> 9147.08]  All right.
[9147.54 --> 9152.58]  It makes a lot of things more understandable when you like do administrative stuff at companies.
[9152.58 --> 9154.36]  It's just like, oh, people are just going to people.
[9154.94 --> 9155.52]  Oh yeah.
[9155.62 --> 9156.22]  People are messy.
[9156.74 --> 9156.98]  Yeah.
[9157.22 --> 9160.26]  And that's, I don't mean that in an insulting way.
[9160.34 --> 9162.46]  I just mean it in a, in a reality check.
[9162.46 --> 9166.56]  You can have great people and sometimes they'll just make a mistake.
[9166.68 --> 9167.08]  Be tired.
[9168.12 --> 9170.58]  Sometimes Troy Hunt will get tired.
[9170.60 --> 9171.26]  Yeah, exactly.
[9171.46 --> 9172.70]  Yeah, exactly.
[9173.06 --> 9173.26]  Yeah.
[9173.54 --> 9175.34]  You know, I didn't really have time this time.
[9175.42 --> 9176.24]  I thought it would be okay.
[9176.38 --> 9179.16]  It's been okay every time for however long.
[9179.36 --> 9180.74]  So I thought I could skip it.
[9180.80 --> 9184.24]  And then, you know, this was the one time that I wasn't able to skip it and something
[9184.24 --> 9184.74]  went wrong.
[9184.80 --> 9185.08]  Whatever.
[9185.22 --> 9185.62]  Who knows?
[9186.12 --> 9186.94]  This happens.
[9186.94 --> 9191.18]  More?
[9191.54 --> 9192.04]  Actually, yeah.
[9192.16 --> 9192.76]  Jaden's here.
[9192.88 --> 9193.92]  I want to show off.
[9194.60 --> 9197.18]  I don't know if you've even seen this or noticed it.
[9197.38 --> 9197.66]  I guess.
[9198.08 --> 9198.36]  Let's see.
[9198.60 --> 9199.82]  Let me go to my screen.
[9199.92 --> 9201.42]  Oh, do we only have the one stream deck?
[9201.88 --> 9202.22]  Yes.
[9202.30 --> 9202.52]  Sick.
[9204.04 --> 9204.78]  There we go.
[9204.94 --> 9205.62]  That's cool.
[9206.10 --> 9207.24]  No, not, not that.
[9207.48 --> 9207.70]  What?
[9207.74 --> 9208.04]  What do you mean?
[9208.08 --> 9208.46]  That is cool.
[9208.46 --> 9209.28]  You already know what that?
[9209.72 --> 9211.90]  We're talking about this.
[9212.80 --> 9213.54]  Oh, what is that?
[9213.72 --> 9214.66]  And this.
[9214.92 --> 9215.62]  Oh, what?
[9215.62 --> 9217.06]  Oh, what?
[9217.14 --> 9220.04]  You can have a firetruck float plane or a Lambo float plane?
[9220.04 --> 9221.42]  Or a Lambo float plane.
[9221.80 --> 9222.04]  Yeah.
[9222.04 --> 9223.38]  How long are we leaving that?
[9224.08 --> 9224.88]  I don't know.
[9225.10 --> 9226.88]  We can kind of leave it for as long as you want.
[9227.44 --> 9230.24]  Without revealing anything, does this have anything to do with-
[9230.24 --> 9230.72]  It sure does.
[9230.82 --> 9231.40]  Okay, cool.
[9231.60 --> 9231.82]  Yep.
[9232.06 --> 9232.94]  That's super cool.
[9233.02 --> 9234.86]  Technology made for that worked for this.
[9234.96 --> 9235.30]  Wow.
[9235.42 --> 9236.02]  That's super cool.
[9236.02 --> 9238.96]  We were talking about how, you know, features that we make for the-
[9238.96 --> 9240.10]  I wasn't going to say it.
[9240.24 --> 9242.06]  For the can do-
[9242.06 --> 9243.18]  I wasn't going to say it.
[9243.18 --> 9244.18]  And then they both-
[9244.18 --> 9245.52]  I wasn't going to say it.
[9245.52 --> 9245.78]  Yeah.
[9246.74 --> 9247.36]  Come on.
[9247.44 --> 9249.04]  You don't really think I was going to say it.
[9249.08 --> 9249.28]  No.
[9249.64 --> 9249.94]  Okay.
[9250.22 --> 9251.00]  I didn't think so at all.
[9251.12 --> 9252.42]  But yeah, there's a firetruck theme.
[9252.66 --> 9256.04]  And if you look into it, Jayden even got like, this is an actual picture of the Lambo.
[9257.12 --> 9257.82]  It's called Lambo time.
[9257.90 --> 9259.24]  I never actually looked at the alt text.
[9260.80 --> 9262.56]  That's an actual like little picture of the Lambo.
[9262.56 --> 9264.20]  And I don't remember.
[9264.52 --> 9266.12]  This might be a picture of the firetruck.
[9266.20 --> 9267.68]  Or it's just a picture of a firetruck.
[9267.74 --> 9267.98]  I don't remember.
[9267.98 --> 9268.92]  That looks like a picture of the toy.
[9269.44 --> 9269.90]  That's awesome.
[9269.90 --> 9270.68]  Maybe it's the toy.
[9270.92 --> 9271.66]  That's awesome.
[9272.98 --> 9274.04]  Jane just said forever.
[9274.18 --> 9274.80]  I mean, it could.
[9275.26 --> 9275.66]  It could.
[9275.88 --> 9278.00]  It's actually going to cost money to remove this.
[9278.00 --> 9279.84]  Oh, my goodness.
[9279.84 --> 9286.32]  We could park it in like user settings instead of having it up here all the time or whatever.
[9286.62 --> 9289.24]  But yeah, some floatplane people noticed it pretty quick.
[9289.74 --> 9293.98]  And we wanted to at least leave it up at a minimum until this WAN show.
[9295.48 --> 9297.86]  By the way, speaking of that picture.
[9298.42 --> 9299.82]  The firetruck has a frame from the unboxing.
[9300.04 --> 9300.12]  Okay.
[9300.76 --> 9304.98]  Apparently, that video is up in early access on floatplane right now.
[9306.68 --> 9307.30]  Oh, yeah.
[9308.00 --> 9310.14]  My house sucks compared to this.
[9310.52 --> 9311.66]  Oh, it has been, to be clear.
[9311.76 --> 9313.54]  Ultimate LAN gaming house tour.
[9313.98 --> 9314.70]  Let's go.
[9314.70 --> 9317.00]  So remember that ultimate, oops.
[9317.20 --> 9321.04]  Remember that ultimate LAN house that went like super viral on Reddit?
[9321.86 --> 9322.78]  We went there.
[9323.08 --> 9324.84]  And we shot a video tour of it.
[9325.40 --> 9331.82]  Man, they were super gracious letting us into their home to check out all the cool goodies.
[9332.26 --> 9336.90]  And they actually arranged to have a LAN the night of the shoot.
[9336.90 --> 9339.16]  So Luke and I played some Left 4 Dead.
[9339.32 --> 9340.90]  Which was like genuinely really fun.
[9341.00 --> 9343.38]  Which was legitimately super fun.
[9343.54 --> 9348.92]  My son got to see it because we happened to be down in Texas already for an unrelated trip.
[9349.00 --> 9351.02]  We shot this quite a while ago actually now.
[9351.02 --> 9362.90]  But as you can imagine, the editing process on something like this when it's, you know, someone's private domicile involves a little bit of back and forth to coordinate and make sure everything's chill and everything's good.
[9363.14 --> 9363.48]  Totally makes sense.
[9363.48 --> 9365.46]  And to be clear, I'm not saying that that's a problem.
[9365.78 --> 9367.84]  They were amazing to work with.
[9367.84 --> 9370.24]  And I'm super excited for you guys to see this video.
[9371.56 --> 9372.92]  Freaking awesome.
[9374.60 --> 9375.52]  What else?
[9375.58 --> 9377.76]  What else we got here, Mr. Dan?
[9378.42 --> 9378.66]  Sure.
[9379.20 --> 9379.90]  Hi, guys.
[9380.02 --> 9385.06]  With the tariffs going to affect, what are items or services in the tech space that you're pretty sure are going to get affected?
[9385.30 --> 9385.56]  Thanks.
[9386.06 --> 9386.88]  I mean, we'll be fine.
[9387.68 --> 9388.70]  Because we're in Canada.
[9389.86 --> 9390.94]  Almost all of them.
[9391.12 --> 9392.32]  Americans, practically everything.
[9392.32 --> 9393.12]  Yeah.
[9393.92 --> 9403.06]  Especially because there's no, like, man, I've heard industry scuttlebutt that's just like, companies are like f***ing pissed.
[9404.04 --> 9412.86]  Because they went and they moved their production out of China, you know, last time around at the last rodeo.
[9413.72 --> 9414.76]  Didn't this happen to Nintendo?
[9415.80 --> 9417.58]  It's happened to a lot of companies.
[9417.70 --> 9417.88]  Yeah.
[9417.88 --> 9424.00]  Where they moved stuff in order to, you know, respond to tariffs on China or whatever.
[9424.38 --> 9426.76]  And then now that country's getting tariffed.
[9426.80 --> 9439.24]  So they're literally just out, like, millions and millions and millions of dollars on, like, facilities that they built in order to appease, you know, this, like, China trade war thing.
[9439.46 --> 9442.32]  And then now it's like, oh, I don't know, it's trade war with everyone.
[9444.02 --> 9444.46]  Yeah.
[9444.52 --> 9446.50]  Apparently Nintendo moved manufacturing to Vietnam.
[9446.50 --> 9453.12]  Uh, Gilmore Dee said that the musical instrument space is just, he said, effed hard.
[9453.86 --> 9454.32]  Yeah.
[9454.76 --> 9455.04]  Yeah.
[9455.42 --> 9456.32]  Well, yeah, because.
[9456.62 --> 9457.18]  Makes sense.
[9457.54 --> 9467.30]  Like, the, the, the, the, by design, the tariffs are so high that you can't just absorb them and keep doing what you're doing.
[9467.68 --> 9468.90]  That's the whole point.
[9468.90 --> 9470.34]  And, like, it's going to be worse.
[9470.42 --> 9473.00]  Some, some people are saying, like, oh, there's a 63% tariff.
[9473.08 --> 9475.02]  Therefore, my thing will cost 63% more.
[9475.02 --> 9475.18]  No.
[9475.18 --> 9476.26]  It's like, no, dude.
[9476.26 --> 9478.50]  It's going to cost way more than that.
[9478.60 --> 9482.30]  Because companies need to protect their margin in order to be able to pay people.
[9482.36 --> 9484.42]  Otherwise, their stock will be destroyed.
[9484.68 --> 9484.92]  Yeah.
[9485.02 --> 9485.84]  That's the bigger one.
[9485.90 --> 9486.68]  Because they could make the same.
[9486.68 --> 9487.10]  That's the biggest one.
[9487.10 --> 9491.50]  They could make the same gross dollars, gross margin dollars, and they could still pay everyone.
[9491.52 --> 9492.58]  But if you're showing brutal losses.
[9493.36 --> 9498.08]  Or if you're showing that your profit's slipping, your stock will get obliterated.
[9498.12 --> 9499.00]  Who knows these days?
[9500.22 --> 9501.10]  I mean, that's fair.
[9501.48 --> 9504.48]  Nothing seems to be based off anything logical anymore.
[9504.50 --> 9505.56]  Everything is meme stocks.
[9505.76 --> 9506.02]  Yeah.
[9506.42 --> 9509.76]  Um, but that, that is traditionally a very bad thing.
[9510.24 --> 9514.92]  Um, so yeah, it's going to be way worse than whatever percentage the tariff on the country is.
[9515.48 --> 9515.88]  Um.
[9516.30 --> 9516.64]  Um.
[9517.10 --> 9520.38]  So, buckle up.
[9521.76 --> 9522.16]  Wow.
[9522.48 --> 9526.26]  Yeah, uh, T. Lewis says, uh, yeah, 90% of guitars are made in China.
[9526.40 --> 9529.08]  The only ones that aren't are super expensive high-end models.
[9529.84 --> 9530.18]  Um.
[9530.46 --> 9531.48]  That's traditionally how it's been.
[9531.56 --> 9533.94]  You can get the USA-made ones for, like, triple the price.
[9534.00 --> 9534.56]  And it's like, yeah.
[9534.90 --> 9543.24]  I think that, I, I, I don't, I don't, I think the only realistic outcome, if this continues the way that it's going,
[9543.24 --> 9558.40]  and it isn't just, you know, a negotiating tactic and will go away immediately, um, the only realistic outcome is people are going to have to embrace the buy once and use a thing forever mentality.
[9558.40 --> 9560.70]  Maybe this will be good for repairability.
[9560.80 --> 9562.40]  Has absolutely died.
[9562.96 --> 9563.54]  Right to repair.
[9563.54 --> 9564.32]  In North America.
[9564.32 --> 9564.76]  Yeah.
[9565.48 --> 9567.06]  Like, that's a cool side effect.
[9567.06 --> 9579.36]  Be ready to spend, you know, $500 on a dining room chair and sit on that chair for the rest of your adult life and never replace it.
[9579.36 --> 9586.44]  And, you know what, you might buy, you know, I bought Canadian-made chairs when I bought our dining room set.
[9587.02 --> 9593.54]  And they look today, other than the leatherette backing, so we had to get them reupholstered, but.
[9593.72 --> 9594.42]  But other than that, yeah.
[9594.44 --> 9599.82]  But they look today and sit today like they did when we bought them over 15 years ago.
[9599.82 --> 9610.72]  So you might get higher quality stuff, but you're not going to be, like, keeping up with fashion when it comes to clothes and home decor.
[9611.24 --> 9618.00]  You'll be buying things that you need and using them until you die and don't need them anymore.
[9618.68 --> 9621.22]  Um, Sop Cannon said parts will be more expensive.
[9621.52 --> 9622.12]  Yeah, absolutely.
[9622.24 --> 9622.66]  Absolutely.
[9622.96 --> 9623.52]  But it'll be...
[9623.52 --> 9625.30]  But they'll be less expensive than buying a whole new one.
[9625.76 --> 9626.20]  Yeah.
[9626.98 --> 9628.60]  And that's a pretty big deal.
[9628.60 --> 9638.64]  Dan, you're up.
[9638.84 --> 9639.04]  Sure.
[9639.60 --> 9641.98]  Will you guys add new bonus bin items?
[9643.16 --> 9644.46]  There's a sticker pack right now.
[9644.76 --> 9645.96]  It ebbs and flows.
[9646.92 --> 9647.94]  Sometimes there's stuff.
[9648.12 --> 9650.14]  Sometimes there isn't as much stuff in the bonus bin.
[9650.14 --> 9652.42]  Um, especially...
[9652.42 --> 9659.62]  You'll see us be more generous with the bonus bin when margins are good and volumes are high.
[9659.76 --> 9664.14]  We're doing a big sale promo and there's other stuff that we know we can make money on.
[9664.26 --> 9665.72]  Do you get tariffed on bonus bin items?
[9666.14 --> 9668.14]  Uh, I have no...
[9669.00 --> 9669.64]  ...idea.
[9670.74 --> 9671.20]  But wait.
[9671.34 --> 9671.80]  Well, hold on.
[9671.88 --> 9672.84]  No, because...
[9672.84 --> 9675.90]  No, because our cost will not be impacted.
[9676.48 --> 9679.24]  And if we sell it for zero dollars, then...
[9680.14 --> 9681.30]  Wait, yeah.
[9681.52 --> 9681.82]  Would...
[9681.82 --> 9683.48]  No, the tariff would be on the cost of the item.
[9683.52 --> 9683.86]  I think you still would.
[9684.02 --> 9687.08]  Because you would have to declare the actual value of the item.
[9687.22 --> 9687.48]  Yeah.
[9687.56 --> 9687.78]  No.
[9687.98 --> 9688.16]  Yeah.
[9688.24 --> 9690.04]  I think you could get tariffed on...
[9690.04 --> 9692.72]  Otherwise you'd just ship everything for zero dollars and then...
[9692.72 --> 9692.74]  Yeah.
[9692.74 --> 9692.88]  Yeah.
[9692.88 --> 9693.34]  No, you're right.
[9693.54 --> 9693.72]  Yeah.
[9693.72 --> 9693.88]  Yep.
[9694.24 --> 9694.48]  Okay.
[9694.62 --> 9700.40]  So yes, if you declare the value of your shipments properly, it would be based on the original value,
[9700.52 --> 9701.96]  not based on the build price.
[9702.08 --> 9703.82]  So yeah, no, you could easily get tariffed on it.
[9704.92 --> 9705.84]  Uh, yikes.
[9706.32 --> 9712.72]  Anyway, so yeah, now is not a great time for us to be taking big hits to our margin on really generous bonus items.
[9712.72 --> 9717.78]  Like the impacts are not always obvious, but they're there.
[9720.24 --> 9720.80]  Oof.
[9720.80 --> 9724.50]  Hey, Slick, Napoleon, and our overlord.
[9724.62 --> 9727.72]  I have a brown belt test tomorrow in Shaolin Kempo.
[9727.96 --> 9728.16]  Nice.
[9728.18 --> 9731.30]  It's my first out of dojo test and I'm kind of worried about it.
[9731.42 --> 9733.70]  Any tips for martial arts and dealing with pressure?
[9735.10 --> 9738.56]  Dude, I mean, practice lots, right?
[9739.04 --> 9741.64]  And when you practice, are you practicing in front of people?
[9741.64 --> 9746.56]  Even practicing in front of one person will make a huge difference to your nerves.
[9746.56 --> 9752.66]  Like if you're just used to being by yourself all the time and nobody like watching you, you know,
[9752.78 --> 9754.80]  that'll make a huge difference.
[9754.86 --> 9757.90]  Whereas if you like, you know, get a, it's tomorrow.
[9758.16 --> 9758.76]  Oh, Lordy.
[9759.00 --> 9760.94]  Yeah, I was going to say, there's not a lot we can say in one day.
[9761.00 --> 9761.50]  I was going to say.
[9761.60 --> 9764.54]  Yeah, it's a little late to, you know, have some people over and, you know,
[9764.96 --> 9768.18]  you know, have dinner together and be like, okay, I want you guys to watch my routine.
[9768.66 --> 9770.56]  You know, because that, that would help with the nerves.
[9770.64 --> 9771.36]  Be the weird guy.
[9771.48 --> 9772.06]  Go to the park.
[9773.36 --> 9774.32]  Just do it there.
[9774.44 --> 9774.80]  That's good.
[9774.80 --> 9775.16]  Do that.
[9775.24 --> 9775.76]  Do that now.
[9775.76 --> 9779.56]  Go do your whole routine at the park with people watching.
[9780.02 --> 9786.14]  And that's going to be so awkward that I guarantee you during your test tomorrow, you're good to go.
[9786.20 --> 9787.10]  Might even feel less awkward.
[9787.22 --> 9787.40]  Yeah.
[9788.82 --> 9789.66]  You got this.
[9789.70 --> 9790.12]  You'll be fine.
[9790.46 --> 9791.16]  That's good advice.
[9791.48 --> 9792.18]  I like it.
[9792.50 --> 9793.86]  While you're at it, play some Pokemon Go.
[9793.94 --> 9794.30]  Walk around.
[9794.52 --> 9794.84]  Yeah.
[9796.26 --> 9796.90]  Actually, no.
[9797.62 --> 9797.98]  Oh, yeah.
[9798.18 --> 9799.06]  It's literally tomorrow.
[9799.34 --> 9800.06]  So, uh.
[9800.24 --> 9801.08]  Don't do that.
[9801.08 --> 9801.56]  Just focus.
[9802.28 --> 9803.00]  Get rested.
[9803.30 --> 9804.28]  You'll be fine.
[9804.28 --> 9807.78]  I love the new set.
[9807.94 --> 9809.68]  Hope it stays for the next few WAN shows.
[9810.16 --> 9810.38]  Question.
[9810.66 --> 9814.34]  How did Yvonne react to the firetruck idea and who came up with it?
[9814.54 --> 9815.96]  Amazing April Fool's video.
[9816.66 --> 9817.06]  Um.
[9817.74 --> 9820.02]  Yvonne is shockingly chill.
[9820.02 --> 9820.34]  These days.
[9820.34 --> 9820.76]  Yeah.
[9820.76 --> 9821.16]  Um.
[9821.26 --> 9821.84]  These days.
[9822.40 --> 9823.66]  She's been through a lot.
[9823.90 --> 9824.24]  Yeah.
[9825.20 --> 9829.02]  I mean, remember when I bought GameStop stock on WAN show?
[9829.18 --> 9829.38]  Like.
[9830.38 --> 9831.38]  I don't know, man.
[9831.44 --> 9831.60]  She.
[9831.60 --> 9831.96]  We.
[9833.96 --> 9837.38]  We play the characters, I think, a little bit.
[9838.06 --> 9838.50]  Um.
[9838.50 --> 9839.36]  Even internally.
[9839.36 --> 9839.78]  Um.
[9839.78 --> 9840.20]  Of like.
[9840.76 --> 9841.16]  Linus.
[9841.28 --> 9841.52]  The.
[9841.90 --> 9842.26]  The.
[9842.26 --> 9842.48]  The.
[9844.16 --> 9845.04]  The firecracker.
[9845.28 --> 9845.54]  You know?
[9845.88 --> 9846.24]  The.
[9846.48 --> 9847.70]  The guy with the.
[9848.38 --> 9848.74]  With the.
[9848.78 --> 9849.58]  Not in like a short.
[9849.66 --> 9850.72]  Short temper kind of way.
[9850.80 --> 9851.12]  Like the.
[9851.16 --> 9851.90]  The guy with the.
[9852.02 --> 9852.74]  Who's unpredictable.
[9853.24 --> 9854.10]  And he'll do things.
[9854.16 --> 9855.08]  And it's wild.
[9855.24 --> 9856.10]  And you're dragging energy.
[9856.22 --> 9856.58]  And all that.
[9856.66 --> 9856.88]  You know?
[9856.88 --> 9857.90]  And Yvonne.
[9858.14 --> 9858.38]  The.
[9858.90 --> 9859.32]  You know?
[9859.40 --> 9859.62]  The.
[9859.94 --> 9860.74]  The reasonable.
[9861.26 --> 9862.14]  Measured person.
[9862.40 --> 9862.50]  And.
[9862.58 --> 9863.24]  And that is true.
[9863.50 --> 9864.52]  That is very true.
[9864.80 --> 9865.54]  To an extent.
[9865.90 --> 9866.84]  But you got to remember.
[9867.06 --> 9867.22]  You know?
[9867.26 --> 9868.58]  We've been together for 20 years.
[9868.78 --> 9869.04]  Right?
[9869.14 --> 9869.88]  Like we've been.
[9869.96 --> 9871.80]  We've been shaping each other.
[9872.16 --> 9872.64]  And.
[9872.80 --> 9873.02]  And.
[9873.24 --> 9873.52]  And.
[9873.60 --> 9873.84]  And.
[9874.46 --> 9875.90]  Molding into each other.
[9876.12 --> 9876.28]  For.
[9877.12 --> 9879.06]  Longer than we have not been together.
[9879.44 --> 9879.74]  You know?
[9880.16 --> 9880.76]  And so.
[9880.92 --> 9882.60]  There's nothing that we can really do.
[9882.74 --> 9883.12]  That's.
[9883.58 --> 9884.98]  That's that surprising.
[9884.98 --> 9885.40]  And we.
[9885.48 --> 9886.48]  And we push each other.
[9886.48 --> 9887.20]  To.
[9887.20 --> 9890.40]  To do things that are outside of our comfort zones.
[9890.98 --> 9891.06]  And.
[9891.88 --> 9893.16]  Being fiscally.
[9894.06 --> 9894.62]  Irresponsible.
[9895.00 --> 9896.58]  But in a way that is.
[9896.88 --> 9897.96]  Planned and measured.
[9899.16 --> 9900.28]  Is kind of our jam.
[9900.84 --> 9901.78]  That's where we've landed.
[9902.36 --> 9902.62]  You know?
[9902.72 --> 9904.20]  The appearance of fiscal irresponsibility.
[9905.02 --> 9905.70]  But actually.
[9906.12 --> 9906.82]  We're pretty careful.
[9906.98 --> 9907.58]  We're pretty prudent.
[9908.32 --> 9909.02]  Like the.
[9909.04 --> 9909.68]  The fire truck.
[9909.82 --> 9910.06]  Was.
[9911.20 --> 9912.30]  A calculated.
[9912.76 --> 9913.20]  Risk.
[9913.76 --> 9913.96]  You know?
[9914.00 --> 9914.44]  We spent.
[9914.64 --> 9915.58]  Thirty five thousand.
[9915.58 --> 9916.28]  Thirty thousand.
[9916.94 --> 9917.30]  Some.
[9917.46 --> 9918.18]  Tens of thousands.
[9918.18 --> 9919.06]  Of dollars on it.
[9919.98 --> 9920.38]  But.
[9920.64 --> 9921.62]  We came up with a plan.
[9922.04 --> 9923.08]  We went to the team.
[9923.16 --> 9923.50]  And we said.
[9923.58 --> 9923.80]  Okay.
[9924.34 --> 9925.16]  What can we do.
[9925.28 --> 9926.22]  For exclusive merch?
[9926.90 --> 9927.42]  You know?
[9927.46 --> 9928.34]  Who can we put.
[9928.60 --> 9929.16]  On this video.
[9929.28 --> 9929.82]  To make sure.
[9929.96 --> 9930.46]  That it is.
[9931.14 --> 9931.46]  Sensational.
[9931.66 --> 9932.26]  And the audience.
[9932.62 --> 9933.02]  Flipping.
[9933.20 --> 9933.70]  Loves it.
[9933.78 --> 9935.02]  And gets excited about it.
[9935.02 --> 9936.92]  And enjoys the crap out of it.
[9936.98 --> 9937.94]  And wants to support us.
[9938.02 --> 9939.08]  To make this kind of content.
[9939.84 --> 9940.24]  Okay.
[9940.36 --> 9940.70]  Team.
[9940.76 --> 9941.38]  Let's get together.
[9941.48 --> 9943.12]  Let's make something truly outstanding.
[9943.62 --> 9943.94]  Let's.
[9944.14 --> 9944.50]  You know.
[9944.58 --> 9945.36]  Promote the merch.
[9945.44 --> 9946.40]  With the live stream.
[9946.54 --> 9947.68]  Let's have some fun.
[9948.04 --> 9948.32]  You know?
[9948.32 --> 9949.58]  Let's do some cool stuff.
[9950.06 --> 9952.14]  And people are probably going to respond.
[9952.34 --> 9954.20]  They're going to pick up some thirst extinguishers.
[9954.32 --> 9956.44]  They're going to subscribe to LTT.
[9956.64 --> 9957.54]  They're going to watch the video.
[9957.68 --> 9960.74]  They're going to pick up some cool firewall department t-shirts.
[9961.38 --> 9963.26]  Let's make sure that this investment.
[9964.18 --> 9965.70]  Let's make sure that this is an investment.
[9965.96 --> 9967.80]  Not just burning money in a fire.
[9968.36 --> 9968.70]  And.
[9968.98 --> 9969.58]  Spoiler alert.
[9970.36 --> 9971.28]  We made it back.
[9971.28 --> 9974.08]  Believe it or not.
[9974.42 --> 9975.96]  We are responsible adults.
[9975.96 --> 9977.50]  Running a responsible adult company.
[9977.62 --> 9980.18]  Making sure that the people who work on all these projects get paid.
[9980.62 --> 9981.54]  And we made it back.
[9982.56 --> 9984.18]  We sold thousands of water bottles.
[9984.94 --> 9985.84]  The water bottles were sick.
[9986.28 --> 9986.48]  Yeah.
[9986.58 --> 9987.46]  I wish there was more shirts.
[9987.62 --> 9988.50]  We sold out of the shirts.
[9988.78 --> 9988.80]  Like.
[9989.12 --> 9990.42]  The purchase of the fire truck.
[9990.56 --> 9991.14]  Kind of like.
[9992.08 --> 9992.72]  Overperformed almost.
[9992.96 --> 9993.18]  Yeah.
[9993.30 --> 9994.36]  Because we sold the shirts too fast.
[9994.36 --> 9995.00]  But that's the thing.
[9995.20 --> 9996.22]  Is you could look at it and go.
[9996.22 --> 9996.40]  Oh.
[9996.50 --> 9996.62]  Well.
[9996.70 --> 9999.42]  It would have been more responsible to rent the fire truck.
[9999.50 --> 9999.78]  And it's like.
[9999.84 --> 9999.94]  Yeah.
[10000.00 --> 10000.70]  But that's where.
[10000.70 --> 10001.90]  That's where the.
[10001.98 --> 10003.68]  The wild wacky side of it.
[10003.76 --> 10004.82]  That I bring to the table.
[10005.12 --> 10005.76]  Comes in.
[10006.18 --> 10006.62]  It's like.
[10007.44 --> 10008.96]  If we were always like.
[10009.04 --> 10009.32]  Oh yeah.
[10009.38 --> 10009.80]  We did a.
[10009.92 --> 10011.66]  A wild thing.
[10011.92 --> 10012.22]  But oh.
[10012.28 --> 10012.60]  Actually.
[10012.78 --> 10013.26]  We didn't.
[10013.34 --> 10014.30]  We did like the boring.
[10014.44 --> 10015.74]  Completely responsible version.
[10016.00 --> 10017.96]  I don't think you guys would engage with that as much.
[10018.04 --> 10019.48]  I think you love the shenanigans.
[10019.98 --> 10020.76]  I love the shenanigans.
[10020.78 --> 10022.12]  I think you love the shenanigans.
[10022.28 --> 10023.02]  Absolutely dude.
[10023.42 --> 10024.42]  It's way cooler.
[10025.06 --> 10026.16]  That we actually bought.
[10026.16 --> 10027.14]  A fire truck.
[10028.00 --> 10028.78]  Minus one thing.
[10028.84 --> 10030.08]  I will not disclose at this time.
[10030.08 --> 10031.48]  The highlight of my week was.
[10033.14 --> 10035.24]  Introing the show by jumping down a fire pole.
[10035.32 --> 10035.62]  Yeah.
[10035.88 --> 10036.62]  Like that was.
[10036.74 --> 10037.10]  That was.
[10037.60 --> 10038.44]  So sick.
[10038.58 --> 10040.12]  The moment when Dan is like.
[10040.74 --> 10041.50]  Counting down.
[10041.66 --> 10041.82]  Yeah.
[10042.12 --> 10043.36]  And my foot's on the thing.
[10043.44 --> 10044.52]  And I look back at Linus.
[10044.58 --> 10045.50]  And Linus is smiling.
[10045.64 --> 10046.06]  I'm just like.
[10046.14 --> 10046.80]  This is sick.
[10047.06 --> 10047.30]  Yeah.
[10047.30 --> 10049.58]  This is just really cool.
[10049.58 --> 10050.96]  I don't know like.
[10051.28 --> 10052.98]  What else to even say in that moment.
[10053.04 --> 10053.74]  It's just awesome.
[10053.92 --> 10055.28]  I mean it's rule number 10.
[10055.44 --> 10056.98]  In the how to make great videos.
[10057.14 --> 10057.28]  Right?
[10057.88 --> 10058.94]  Have fun.
[10059.20 --> 10059.38]  Yeah.
[10059.88 --> 10061.74]  If you're not having fun.
[10062.76 --> 10064.26]  Everyone's gonna pick it up.
[10064.26 --> 10065.54]  And you know what.
[10066.02 --> 10067.46]  It is way more fun.
[10067.46 --> 10068.80]  For me to sit here.
[10068.98 --> 10069.88]  In the real.
[10070.22 --> 10071.44]  Actual fire truck.
[10072.34 --> 10073.22]  Having come from.
[10073.34 --> 10075.06]  Unboxing a weird random toy.
[10075.38 --> 10076.96]  Because my co-worker needed help.
[10077.06 --> 10078.18]  Moving it on the website.
[10078.30 --> 10079.12]  We both worked for.
[10079.56 --> 10079.76]  To.
[10080.40 --> 10081.34]  This whole thing.
[10081.40 --> 10082.74]  Where you guys are watching us.
[10082.82 --> 10084.42]  And we have this incredible team.
[10084.62 --> 10085.70]  And we can just like.
[10086.02 --> 10087.06]  Buy a fire truck.
[10087.14 --> 10087.58]  Because we.
[10087.80 --> 10088.94]  Fucking feel like it.
[10089.30 --> 10090.62]  Like how cool is that.
[10091.32 --> 10092.00]  That's fun.
[10092.00 --> 10094.48]  The only thing.
[10095.18 --> 10097.02]  I feel like missed from the video.
[10097.60 --> 10099.88]  Was I think you should have hit me with the hose.
[10100.70 --> 10101.56]  I hit Dennis.
[10102.16 --> 10103.16]  You hit Dennis?
[10103.32 --> 10104.00]  I shot his car.
[10104.30 --> 10104.76]  Oh yeah.
[10105.20 --> 10106.70]  I would have blasted him more.
[10106.80 --> 10109.06]  But he actually had his passenger side window unrolled.
[10109.20 --> 10109.62]  I saw that.
[10109.62 --> 10110.38]  And he didn't know.
[10111.04 --> 10111.76]  He was like.
[10111.78 --> 10112.88]  Why didn't you spray me more?
[10112.92 --> 10113.20]  I was like.
[10113.20 --> 10113.52]  Dude.
[10113.60 --> 10114.56]  Your window's open.
[10115.92 --> 10118.24]  Like aren't you happy that I noticed?
[10120.60 --> 10121.28]  That's funny.
[10122.56 --> 10124.78]  That moment when I'm the adult on set.
[10124.92 --> 10126.36]  When we're playing with our fire truck.
[10131.72 --> 10132.96]  You don't want to show your highlight of the week.
[10133.02 --> 10134.32]  It's because it's not my news.
[10135.04 --> 10135.24]  Yeah.
[10135.36 --> 10136.32]  It's someone else's news.
[10136.96 --> 10137.56]  Someone guessed it.
[10137.60 --> 10138.12]  It's an engagement.
[10138.28 --> 10139.02]  No it's not engagement.
[10139.12 --> 10139.54]  No it's not.
[10139.54 --> 10140.74]  It's just straight up not my news.
[10140.84 --> 10140.96]  Yeah.
[10140.96 --> 10141.42]  So I'm not doing it.
[10141.56 --> 10143.30]  And you'll know soon enough.
[10143.38 --> 10143.52]  Yeah.
[10143.62 --> 10144.56]  And it'll be great.
[10144.70 --> 10146.02]  And you'll be super jazzed.
[10146.20 --> 10149.22]  And we will be jazzed to talk about it.
[10149.22 --> 10149.52]  Yeah.
[10149.60 --> 10151.02]  But it is someone else's news.
[10151.14 --> 10151.64]  And it is.
[10152.78 --> 10154.82]  It is up to them how they want to break it.
[10155.00 --> 10155.14]  Yeah.
[10155.56 --> 10158.20]  And we are just happy to be helping make it a reality.
[10158.78 --> 10159.00]  Yeah.
[10159.24 --> 10159.54]  All right.
[10159.62 --> 10160.12]  What else we got?
[10160.60 --> 10161.40]  Hello LLD.
[10161.74 --> 10164.06]  My house has in floor radiant heating.
[10164.40 --> 10166.70]  And we want to control it centrally and remotely.
[10167.20 --> 10167.50]  Linus.
[10167.56 --> 10170.56]  I was wondering if you were pleased with the solution you showed.
[10170.56 --> 10172.48]  Actually it's pretty okay.
[10172.48 --> 10183.58]  Home Assistant with those EcoBs wired into those OG two wire things with the bypass mode thing actually works pretty solid.
[10183.74 --> 10193.48]  All the Wi-Fi issues I was having with those EcoB thermostats went away once we turned off the 2.4 gigahertz radios that for whatever reason defaulted to all beyond and whatever.
[10194.30 --> 10195.72]  I'm not going to blame anyone.
[10195.72 --> 10201.44]  We turned off all the 2.4 gigahertz radios that were talking over each other and it's much better now.
[10202.34 --> 10214.34]  And basically as long as you're willing to put in the time to kind of build logic around it there can be a little bit of savings compared to what most people tell you about in floor radiant heating.
[10214.54 --> 10216.78]  Which is that you should just run it at a constant temperature all the time.
[10216.84 --> 10222.24]  That doesn't work for me because I like my house a little bit warmer when I'm awake than I like it when I'm sleeping.
[10222.24 --> 10230.84]  And that's especially challenging to balance when your sleeping is upstairs and in floor radiant heating tends to just rise up.
[10231.00 --> 10234.72]  So you can't just have it like warm in the living spaces downstairs and cool in the bedrooms.
[10234.86 --> 10239.76]  You can do that with like forced air but you can't really do it very well with in floor.
[10241.12 --> 10245.02]  Overall I'm pretty happy with it but you've got to be ready to do some work fine tuning it.
[10245.02 --> 10260.88]  And every fall and spring I have to manually turn off the in floor switch over to radiant and then turn off the radiant and switch over to forced air in order to keep things balanced.
[10260.88 --> 10264.32]  Because if they're both active at the same time they fight each other and it's a nightmare.
[10264.32 --> 10270.44]  Oh there we go.
[10270.74 --> 10273.14]  Hey y'all I have nowhere else to ask this.
[10273.34 --> 10277.48]  So what's the title theme of Scrapyard Wars in season 3 and up?
[10278.04 --> 10279.76]  And why wasn't it in the newest season?
[10280.32 --> 10281.76]  Also more women's clothing when?
[10282.44 --> 10283.30]  I wasn't sure what this meant.
[10283.72 --> 10285.52]  I figured you guys might be able to pick this apart.
[10285.54 --> 10286.00]  Oh the music.
[10287.02 --> 10288.42]  Oh title theme.
[10289.42 --> 10290.20]  It's prop.
[10290.60 --> 10292.26]  I would think it would be under it.
[10292.26 --> 10292.50]  No?
[10292.50 --> 10294.50]  If we...
[10295.46 --> 10297.68]  Because I know we use endemic sound.
[10297.84 --> 10298.08]  Is that it?
[10298.10 --> 10299.66]  So Scrapyard Wars 3 and up?
[10300.70 --> 10302.00]  Dude that's old.
[10302.78 --> 10304.04]  Well they said end up.
[10304.56 --> 10308.86]  Yeah I just mean like well we would have started using that maybe before we were using endemic.
[10309.90 --> 10311.10]  Oh yeah no we don't.
[10311.20 --> 10313.12]  Dude I have no idea.
[10313.92 --> 10314.70]  I'm so sorry.
[10314.80 --> 10317.24]  You might have to like shazam it or something.
[10318.66 --> 10319.82]  Oh epidemic sound?
[10319.94 --> 10320.24]  I don't know.
[10320.24 --> 10320.56]  Something.
[10320.82 --> 10321.50]  I don't even know.
[10321.74 --> 10322.20]  Epidemic sound yeah.
[10322.20 --> 10324.26]  I don't even know what service we use for it.
[10324.44 --> 10326.06]  My deepest most sincere apologies.
[10326.30 --> 10327.46]  As for why we didn't use it?
[10327.76 --> 10329.66]  Probably because we forgot.
[10330.98 --> 10333.32]  In the description it links to Approaching Nirvana.
[10334.12 --> 10339.58]  No that's just an agreement that we had with them that we included them in every video description.
[10339.58 --> 10344.34]  As long as we were using their song for our intros or something.
[10344.74 --> 10345.14]  Got it.
[10345.14 --> 10345.52]  Yeah.
[10345.52 --> 10351.40]  So we didn't pay for either that or Supernova from Laszlo.
[10351.40 --> 10359.80]  Because they were like oh no we're just like stoked you guys are using it as long as you credit us then we consider that to be more than worth it.
[10359.96 --> 10360.70]  Yeah that was pretty sweet.
[10360.96 --> 10361.14]  Yeah.
[10361.14 --> 10362.14]  Hey Dan Linus and Luke.
[10362.14 --> 10363.86]  Hey Dan Linus and Luke.
[10364.06 --> 10371.98]  Do you have any updates on the lab's lanyard as I got one in my last order and went looking at the page to think about getting a second?
[10371.98 --> 10372.42]  No.
[10372.42 --> 10373.14]  Uh no.
[10373.32 --> 10376.20]  I have no updates to share at this time.
[10377.10 --> 10377.58]  Um.
[10379.08 --> 10384.86]  I think Nick is still trying to figure out what exactly happened with the process there.
[10385.52 --> 10393.22]  And um other than hey guys if you have a problem with it even though it didn't have the box stitch like it was supposed to.
[10393.50 --> 10401.28]  Oh I do know that the material is that way because we printed on it and we couldn't use that tougher material and print on it with the lab's logo and everything.
[10401.28 --> 10405.42]  As for the box stitch basically we're going to have to do a virtual box stitch for you.
[10405.50 --> 10408.34]  If it breaks you let us know and we'll get you taken care of.
[10408.38 --> 10408.96]  Trust me bro.
[10409.68 --> 10410.08]  Um.
[10410.60 --> 10412.22]  And we're going to make sure that doesn't happen again.
[10412.42 --> 10412.62]  There.
[10412.78 --> 10413.90]  Let's go with that for the update.
[10415.08 --> 10416.52]  Hey LMG Foolies.
[10416.60 --> 10418.00]  This is one we already did earlier.
[10418.48 --> 10419.48]  Love the fire truck videos.
[10419.62 --> 10425.38]  Is there an actual end game as to what will happen uh to the truck or was the purchase just for the memes?
[10425.66 --> 10431.26]  Uh there's no clear end game but I figure it can't be that hard to like find someone who needs a fire truck.
[10431.28 --> 10434.50]  It wouldn't be a fire department because this is too old.
[10434.58 --> 10435.98]  It's it's out of service.
[10436.64 --> 10443.08]  Uh but you know some private organization that needs to have on-site firefighting capabilities could be interested in it.
[10443.30 --> 10444.28]  I mean it works.
[10444.50 --> 10446.24]  That's exactly what it was doing.
[10446.48 --> 10447.86]  That's the duty it was pulling before.
[10448.54 --> 10448.86]  Um.
[10449.76 --> 10453.16]  And you know we'll make sure that we take care of it while we have it.
[10453.26 --> 10455.68]  You know we'll we'll get it you know ready for its next owner.
[10455.98 --> 10457.56]  So I'd love to resell it.
[10457.62 --> 10462.54]  If we could find a worthy cause that needs something like that that isn't just like some commercial entity or whatever.
[10463.06 --> 10467.58]  Um then we would consider doing an extraordinary price on it or even donating it.
[10467.80 --> 10468.14]  Um.
[10468.80 --> 10469.16]  But.
[10469.36 --> 10470.18]  But that's not yet.
[10470.34 --> 10471.06]  That's not yet.
[10471.18 --> 10471.70]  That is not.
[10471.78 --> 10472.66]  That is not this day.
[10472.66 --> 10473.30]  Let's have fun with it for a while.
[10473.42 --> 10473.60]  Yeah.
[10473.60 --> 10475.96]  For now we're gonna we're gonna pump water through some water blocks.
[10476.02 --> 10477.16]  See if we can blow them up you know.
[10477.16 --> 10478.96]  Let's go.
[10482.28 --> 10484.58]  See what else we've got here.
[10485.26 --> 10486.54]  Hey LDL.
[10486.74 --> 10489.58]  Luke or Dan do you have any stories from when you did Concrete?
[10490.36 --> 10490.54]  Sure.
[10490.94 --> 10493.46]  Shout out to Tatiana from CW for the amazing merch.
[10494.72 --> 10496.12]  Uh the Concrete Cooled PC.
[10497.74 --> 10499.48]  He's a Luke or Dan though.
[10499.56 --> 10499.74]  Oh.
[10499.92 --> 10502.20]  Uh they they probably don't know that you guys weren't involved in that.
[10502.44 --> 10504.98]  Uh so the April Fool's Concrete Cooled PC.
[10504.98 --> 10511.00]  My favorite part of it was us realizing on the day of the shoot what a catastrophe we
[10511.00 --> 10516.02]  had on our hands when we didn't have any way of making the plan.
[10516.68 --> 10517.56]  The plan.
[10517.82 --> 10524.30]  The plan from the team was to just put paint in water and I was like oh my god that's not
[10524.30 --> 10524.88]  gonna work.
[10525.08 --> 10528.16]  So I had them go get milk and we saved it.
[10528.46 --> 10534.46]  We managed to just put paint and dye or something in milk to turn it the color of concrete.
[10534.46 --> 10541.24]  And to do so convincingly enough that some people legitimately believed it.
[10541.38 --> 10541.66]  Quite a few.
[10541.94 --> 10546.52]  Nobody was dumb enough to try it on their own and like be mad about it or whatever.
[10546.72 --> 10552.86]  But some people legitimately were like trying to come up with theories about how or like
[10552.86 --> 10553.86]  trying to debunk it.
[10554.14 --> 10558.14]  You know they were like with the exothermic properties of concrete curing there's no way
[10558.14 --> 10558.48]  blah blah.
[10558.48 --> 10561.40]  Like taking it seriously one way or another.
[10561.60 --> 10561.74]  Yeah.
[10561.92 --> 10567.84]  And that's my other favorite story of the concrete cooled PC April Fool's is arguing with the
[10567.84 --> 10574.34]  writing team who was telling me that it's not even funny because nobody would be like
[10574.34 --> 10577.36]  f***ing stupid enough to believe it.
[10577.36 --> 10579.64]  Oh yeah that would probably work.
[10580.08 --> 10581.88]  Nobody could be stupid enough to believe it.
[10581.92 --> 10583.04]  It's not even an April Fool.
[10583.28 --> 10585.10]  It's basically just a dumb skit.
[10585.56 --> 10587.06]  And I was like no.
[10588.14 --> 10588.50]  No.
[10590.02 --> 10590.42]  No.
[10590.58 --> 10591.66]  I've been doing this a long time.
[10591.68 --> 10593.02]  I've been doing this a long time.
[10593.12 --> 10594.48]  This ain't my first rodeo.
[10595.44 --> 10596.10]  Trust me.
[10596.62 --> 10598.14]  I can sell it.
[10598.14 --> 10606.62]  And so I some some other members of the team ate humble pie when I sold it managed to convince
[10606.62 --> 10612.62]  people that we had cooled a PC with concrete or that we were trying to earnestly convince
[10612.62 --> 10613.50]  anyone that we had done it.
[10613.54 --> 10616.76]  We got people to take it seriously which I thought was pretty funny.
[10617.76 --> 10619.10]  Hello Linus, Luke and Dan.
[10619.40 --> 10623.20]  Linus having owned both a FEV Volt and an EV Taycan.
[10623.66 --> 10626.86]  What do you think is right for the average person in 2025?
[10626.86 --> 10629.14]  Should all ICE vehicles be hybrid?
[10629.72 --> 10631.36]  FEVs by this point?
[10631.74 --> 10633.74]  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle is a FEV.
[10633.82 --> 10634.64]  Thank you very much Dan.
[10634.84 --> 10635.04]  FEV.
[10636.02 --> 10638.92]  I think plug-in hybrid is outstanding.
[10639.30 --> 10647.00]  My review of the Volt based on my time with it was I said I said what I meant and I meant
[10647.00 --> 10647.62]  what I said.
[10647.92 --> 10651.10]  I think the Volt was a misunderstood car.
[10651.52 --> 10653.36]  I think that it was outstanding.
[10653.92 --> 10655.98]  An incredible step forward.
[10655.98 --> 10663.30]  A happy medium between full electric operation, hybrid operation and ICE operation.
[10663.30 --> 10665.92]  You literally could operate it in any one of those three modes.
[10666.04 --> 10672.42]  So it was either an EV for your daily commute to and from work or it magically turned into
[10672.42 --> 10676.22]  an incredibly efficient ICE vehicle if you needed to go a long distance.
[10676.22 --> 10678.06]  I absolutely love that car.
[10678.06 --> 10681.84]  I feel again speaking of humble pie.
[10681.84 --> 10688.88]  I feel very vindicated because I talked up the Volt a lot back in the day and got crapped
[10688.88 --> 10692.46]  on by both the EV crowd and the ICE crowd.
[10693.02 --> 10696.54]  And now plug-in hybrids are freaking everywhere.
[10696.54 --> 10703.74]  Every major manufacturer, even hypercars, they're looking at plug-in hybrid in order to find a
[10703.74 --> 10708.50]  balance between economy, performance, complexity, everything.
[10709.12 --> 10710.60]  Dude, they're outstanding.
[10711.46 --> 10718.20]  What was the backorder time on the RAV4 Prime when Toyota launched it?
[10718.20 --> 10720.08]  Like four years or something like that?
[10720.14 --> 10724.82]  Like literally companies cannot make enough of these plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.
[10725.06 --> 10728.24]  And I got absolutely dunked on for buying one.
[10729.36 --> 10731.64]  I think plug-in hybrid is the play.
[10731.80 --> 10738.48]  The only reason that I am full EV is, and this is not, well, there's a couple of reasons,
[10738.48 --> 10744.14]  but one of the biggest ones that really drove me to stop daily-ing the Volt, which by the
[10744.14 --> 10748.36]  way, we kept, we sold it to the company and we still use it to run errands and stuff because
[10748.36 --> 10750.72]  it's a super efficient car.
[10751.26 --> 10752.38]  The back seats fold down.
[10752.46 --> 10754.80]  It has a huge trunk capacity for what it is.
[10754.84 --> 10755.58]  Anyway, sorry, sorry.
[10755.60 --> 10756.04]  I love the Volt.
[10756.94 --> 10761.56]  The only reason that I got rid of it or a big driving force, aside from just thinking
[10761.56 --> 10764.56]  the Taycan is super cool, is that I hate going to the gas station.
[10764.56 --> 10769.14]  Again, I don't like, I don't plan my time very well.
[10769.74 --> 10772.72]  I am almost invariably late for everything.
[10772.92 --> 10773.58]  You don't plan your time.
[10773.82 --> 10778.62]  And when I have to go to the gas station on my way somewhere, I am then five to 10 minutes
[10778.62 --> 10780.26]  even later than I already would have been.
[10780.48 --> 10780.76]  Yeah.
[10780.88 --> 10782.54]  So it doesn't work for me.
[10783.76 --> 10788.56]  So I like having an EV that I charge every night in my garage and I never have to think
[10788.56 --> 10789.02]  about fuel.
[10789.02 --> 10797.16]  It's just like, I was reading this article about like, like decision overload or whatever.
[10797.38 --> 10798.76]  I make too many decisions.
[10798.96 --> 10803.28]  I have too many little things to have to think about whether my car is fueled.
[10804.40 --> 10806.78]  And, and I can, I can do it.
[10806.94 --> 10807.30]  Obviously.
[10807.74 --> 10807.90]  Did.
[10808.20 --> 10808.68]  Long time.
[10809.18 --> 10810.36]  Or I just, I cannot.
[10811.86 --> 10812.18]  Oh.
[10812.88 --> 10813.42]  Dan, the bell.
[10813.48 --> 10814.14]  It's over here.
[10814.26 --> 10814.62]  The bell.
[10814.80 --> 10814.96]  Okay.
[10815.10 --> 10815.22]  Yeah.
[10815.22 --> 10819.62]  Or I could just not bother and I could just have a car that I plug in in my, in my garage
[10819.62 --> 10820.76]  and I just don't think about it.
[10821.24 --> 10824.74]  Um, and realistically, I, I worked pretty hard.
[10824.82 --> 10829.06]  I was also lucky, but I worked pretty hard and I decided I was going to treat myself to
[10829.06 --> 10830.50]  a really, really stupid present.
[10830.66 --> 10831.32]  And I bought a Taycan.
[10835.08 --> 10836.44]  My midlife crisis mobile.
[10836.56 --> 10837.54]  That's what I call it.
[10837.72 --> 10838.32]  Do you like it?
[10838.66 --> 10838.86]  Yep.
[10839.08 --> 10841.76]  But I think plug in hybrid electric vehicles are sick.
[10841.76 --> 10843.76]  Uh, yeah.
[10844.68 --> 10845.50]  I think they're super cool.
[10845.62 --> 10849.84]  Uh, Volvo has, uh, their, um, shoot.
[10849.92 --> 10851.66]  I think XC is the electrified line.
[10851.76 --> 10855.96]  So whatever, whatever the other, whatever the other one is, but there's whatever 90.
[10856.14 --> 10856.98]  It looks pretty cool.
[10858.80 --> 10859.72]  Hello, LLD.
[10859.94 --> 10861.56]  I'm going to Japan at the end of the month.
[10861.58 --> 10863.94]  And I know Linus was there a year or so ago.
[10864.18 --> 10867.04]  What cool tech things that amaze you during that trip?
[10867.60 --> 10870.42]  Plus when LTT branded cables.
[10870.42 --> 10870.80]  I don't know.
[10870.86 --> 10875.48]  Japan has like, other than like weird exclusives, like, oh my, oh my gosh.
[10875.56 --> 10880.52]  We, uh, we unboxed a Hello Kitty smartwatch, like officially licensed Hello Kitty smartwatch
[10880.52 --> 10881.10]  for adults.
[10881.72 --> 10885.36]  They, they were very, uh, clear.
[10885.60 --> 10886.34]  Persistent about that.
[10886.34 --> 10886.72]  For adults.
[10886.88 --> 10887.08]  Okay.
[10887.88 --> 10890.10]  Um, on short circuit, that's coming soon.
[10890.28 --> 10896.20]  So other than like exclusive stuff like that, like Japan's technology is basically like what
[10896.20 --> 10896.94]  we have here now.
[10896.94 --> 10902.12]  It's not like, it's not like it used to be where they got the Super Nintendo, like a year
[10902.12 --> 10904.16]  before, months prior, whatever.
[10904.34 --> 10906.72]  If anything, a lot of their stuff is quote unquote behind.
[10908.00 --> 10908.68]  Ah, yeah.
[10908.68 --> 10910.58]  In some ways that I like, actually.
[10910.94 --> 10912.70]  Like they, uh, I don't know.
[10912.94 --> 10920.10]  Public terminals have like big chunky buttons instead of garbage, terrible touchscreens, which
[10920.10 --> 10924.88]  is great, but it's like older tech.
[10924.96 --> 10929.40]  Technically I've, I've heard that they're like banking systems and stuff like that are
[10929.40 --> 10932.26]  all feel kind of old.
[10932.32 --> 10936.02]  But again, in some ways, like I don't necessarily think that every change is actually good.
[10936.02 --> 10944.42]  Um, as for when LTT branded cables soon TM, man, the samples, I was going to say they
[10944.42 --> 10945.96]  look good, but they more than look good.
[10945.96 --> 10947.92]  Um, I've been, I've been dailying them.
[10948.04 --> 10950.20]  I'm super, super happy with them.
[10950.32 --> 10951.22]  They're going to be expensive.
[10951.88 --> 10956.38]  Um, tariffs aren't going to help, but dude, they're so nice.
[10956.66 --> 10963.62]  It's like if there was a cable that I could buy and just be confident that every time I
[10963.62 --> 10966.42]  plug it in, it's going to do exactly what it says on the side of it.
[10966.96 --> 10968.34]  It's the LTT cables.
[10968.34 --> 10972.34]  The, uh, the high speed stuff is all coax shielded.
[10972.40 --> 10973.86]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[10973.86 --> 10981.26]  I actually ran into an issue where I used the USB-C to USB-C and it didn't do what it
[10981.26 --> 10983.70]  needed to like yesterday.
[10984.06 --> 10984.46]  Yep.
[10984.76 --> 10985.44]  Very excited.
[10985.62 --> 10986.08]  All the time.
[10986.20 --> 10986.88]  So annoying.
[10987.50 --> 10989.08]  And last one I've got for you today.
[10989.32 --> 10994.42]  Hey Linus and Luke, I recently saw a video about using both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs in one setup
[10994.42 --> 10998.38]  using lossless scaling's new dual GPU frame generation method.
[10998.76 --> 10999.88]  Wondering if you have any thoughts.
[10999.98 --> 11000.42]  I do.
[11000.42 --> 11002.46]  Uh, we're going to be doing, I'm going to try it.
[11002.52 --> 11003.48]  We're going to do a video on it.
[11003.60 --> 11008.28]  Um, just a matter of like when we can get it on the schedule, but yeah, I definitely want
[11008.28 --> 11008.82]  to explore it.
[11008.88 --> 11010.06]  Brings the old meme back, dude.
[11010.14 --> 11011.28]  Linus did that in 2013.
[11011.68 --> 11012.44]  Oh, that's true.
[11012.50 --> 11012.94]  I did.
[11013.00 --> 11014.70]  I did SLI and Crossfire.
[11014.88 --> 11015.62]  In the same system.
[11015.70 --> 11016.38]  In the same system.
[11017.26 --> 11018.90]  Uh, hell yeah.
[11018.94 --> 11020.08]  It worked by the way.
[11020.20 --> 11020.42]  Yep.
[11020.42 --> 11023.42]  Uh, Linus, SLI, Crossfire.
[11023.42 --> 11024.02]  Crossfire.
[11024.62 --> 11025.44]  Check this out.
[11025.68 --> 11027.30]  Check this out.
[11028.50 --> 11030.50]  That brick, hold on.
[11030.70 --> 11037.32]  That brick of GPUs in there is two, I want to say, 780s?
[11037.42 --> 11038.52]  I don't remember.
[11038.52 --> 11038.58]  Yeah.
[11038.58 --> 11044.82]  780 Ti's and two R9 290Xs installed in the same system.
[11045.74 --> 11047.64]  So, what was the idea here?
[11048.70 --> 11050.18]  Look at you just like in the background.
[11050.84 --> 11051.74]  Making dinner.
[11052.30 --> 11053.60]  What am I doing?
[11055.62 --> 11057.72]  I forget what the point of this was.
[11057.90 --> 11059.60]  I thought you don't skip a beat either.
[11059.80 --> 11067.00]  Like you just, you could, games would scale in both or, I don't, man, what was the point?
[11067.00 --> 11067.98]  What was I trying to accomplish?
[11068.10 --> 11068.94]  There was a reason.
[11072.82 --> 11074.50]  Okay, NVIDIA SLI.
[11074.82 --> 11075.18]  Yeah.
[11077.00 --> 11077.40]  Okay.
[11078.08 --> 11079.00]  Yeah, we're playing some.
[11079.04 --> 11080.80]  I really think you're just trying to prove that it works.
[11081.38 --> 11083.92]  That you could have both drivers installed at the same time?
[11084.02 --> 11084.56]  Yeah, I think so.
[11084.74 --> 11086.26]  Look at all these DVI connections.
[11086.50 --> 11087.10]  That's absurd.
[11087.20 --> 11087.86]  That's hilarious.
[11088.76 --> 11090.48]  But I'm pretty sure that was, that was it.
[11090.68 --> 11091.26]  Which is great.
[11092.28 --> 11092.98]  It's interesting.
[11093.72 --> 11095.16]  Even now, that's interesting.
[11095.52 --> 11096.26]  You can have both drivers?
[11096.42 --> 11096.88]  Like, what the heck?
[11097.36 --> 11098.54]  What am I looking at?
[11098.72 --> 11099.66]  Good gravy.
[11100.32 --> 11101.20]  What, what is this?
[11101.20 --> 11103.76]  Why did we put this in our promotion for Audible?
[11104.82 --> 11106.48]  Geeblis.
[11106.62 --> 11108.00]  Is that even Twitch safe?
[11109.32 --> 11111.50]  We did some stuff back then.
[11111.56 --> 11111.80]  I don't know.
[11111.80 --> 11112.20]  It was fine.
[11112.28 --> 11113.52]  Male presenting nipple.
[11113.84 --> 11116.82]  Dude, I, dude, I, I don't know, man.
[11116.90 --> 11120.88]  I've talked about this before, but I just get such a kick out of it anytime people are
[11120.88 --> 11122.82]  like LTT used to be mature.
[11124.38 --> 11125.46]  Old LTT was better.
[11126.10 --> 11126.36]  Yeah.
[11126.56 --> 11126.96]  Yeah, yeah.
[11127.00 --> 11127.70]  100% better.
[11127.80 --> 11129.58]  Nah, new LTT is, new LTT is better.
[11129.60 --> 11129.70]  What?
[11129.80 --> 11131.46]  You don't want to do dodo racing anymore?
[11131.62 --> 11132.06]  Look at this.
[11132.32 --> 11132.82]  Look at this.
[11133.26 --> 11133.76]  This is great.
[11134.52 --> 11135.14]  It's a float plane.
[11136.22 --> 11137.44]  Got a fox on it.
[11139.52 --> 11140.62]  Non-copyrighting.
[11140.62 --> 11141.08]  Let me guess.
[11141.08 --> 11142.34]  Fringing fire kitsune.
[11142.62 --> 11143.52]  69 cents.
[11143.52 --> 11146.24]  Because, of course, it is.
[11147.00 --> 11147.24]  Yeah.
[11147.86 --> 11152.08]  And it's, of course, time to say, see you again next week.
[11153.08 --> 11154.34]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[11155.10 --> 11155.54]  I don't know.
[11156.34 --> 11156.80]  Maybe not.
[11159.08 --> 11159.52]  Bye!
[11159.52 --> 11159.60]  Bye!
