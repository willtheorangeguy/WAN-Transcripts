Look, I like LTT and I've been here for quite a while now but it is absolutely true that you need to get good again. This last week's videos for instance, the finale to scrapyard wars didn't even have the teams reacting each other's setups, you talked 13 minutes about your wife and possibly you switching to Apple like love Yvonne but I can't give a f, Plouffe reviewed a heavy Alienware also can't give a f, you reacted to some monitor setups, low effort reacting nonsense. The 3 stage cooler was sick af I watched that to the end. Idk if it's tech space in general being trash or not but I do know these were trash tier content I didn't care enough to watch.
As for the wan show, youtube actively sabotages you by hiding Noki's timestamp comment. You aren't doing the timestamps either. The merch messages I don't care to listen to without the timestamps. And you give way too much time to the very first topics which are usually your drama, others drama, some sort of interaction, calling out, argument. I don't care! I want you to either talk about the actual news or go on an opinionated rant on something, even paint
