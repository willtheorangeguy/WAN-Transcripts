On the collab feature, in this case I happened to be interested in Linus being interviewed, but 9/10 times it's just either creators doing something completely random with other creators I don't care about or it's just creators doing a podcast. In general I am not interested in podcasts, even WAN is barely bearable (not for quality reasons but just my attention span) with timestamps. It's incredibly rare for the collab feature to lead me to click a video, it more often just causes me to actually go through the effort of unsubscribing.
