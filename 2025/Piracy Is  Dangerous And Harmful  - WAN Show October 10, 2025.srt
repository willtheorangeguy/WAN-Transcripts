[0.00 → 12.00] What is up everybody and welcome to the WAN show.
[12.12 → 16.44] We've got a great, great show lined up for you guys this week.
[16.44 → 22.52] We're going to be talking about YouTube taking down a video that showed how to turn your
[22.52 → 24.96] Plex server into a live TV channel.
[25.08 → 27.02] That was dangerous and harmful.
[28.12 → 28.64] Dangerous.
[28.72 → 29.48] Yeah, we can't have that.
[29.48 → 30.40] Yeah, you might have.
[31.30 → 32.86] You might store ISOs there.
[32.96 → 35.20] You wouldn't download a danger, would you?
[35.70 → 36.26] I would download.
[36.36 → 37.32] I have downloaded danger.
[37.78 → 38.92] You've downloaded danger.
[39.16 → 40.26] I have objectively downloaded danger.
[40.26 → 42.32] How did you download my middle name?
[44.78 → 53.78] In other news, Microsoft has blocked more ways to set up a Windows 11 local account.
[54.16 → 55.42] Did they Siri?
[55.84 → 57.82] Do they have like a committee?
[57.82 → 61.94] An internal committee for how to make things less convenient?
[62.08 → 63.26] How to make Windows worse?
[64.38 → 65.00] Good committee.
[65.12 → 65.92] Quality committee.
[66.04 → 66.92] It feels like it sometimes.
[66.92 → 68.24] Truly doing the Lord's work.
[68.46 → 72.30] In good news, Synology backpedals on banning third-party hard drives.
[72.30 → 73.68] And in...
[73.68 → 77.32] Is there more good news somewhere?
[77.32 → 78.96] I told them there was a good show.
[79.48 → 80.86] I told them it was a good show.
[81.02 → 83.20] It is going to be a good show, but is there more good news?
[84.34 → 86.90] Microsoft promises more Xbox hardware still on the way.
[87.78 → 88.68] Do you care about that?
[88.72 → 89.32] I don't know.
[89.60 → 89.96] Sure.
[90.08 → 90.92] Let's go with that.
[91.12 → 92.06] That's the best I could get.
[92.06 → 115.24] The show is brought to you today by Messi, Proton, Squarespace, and Ubiquity.
[115.24 → 120.74] Alongside, of course, our wrap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[120.88 → 122.30] Dude, with the flip around?
[125.04 → 125.96] The what?
[126.22 → 127.20] You did it out of order.
[127.60 → 128.12] Did I?
[128.28 → 128.54] Yeah.
[129.26 → 130.72] You even ever so slightly dictate.
[130.78 → 131.94] You don't even notice anymore, do you?
[132.22 → 133.20] You just autocorrect.
[134.00 → 134.70] That's fantastic.
[135.90 → 137.00] What was the flip around?
[137.26 → 139.42] You did the middle one, then the top one, then the bottom one.
[139.42 → 146.16] Did he not?
[146.26 → 147.24] I thought he just did that.
[147.80 → 153.98] Just over a week ago, Space Invader 1 had a video taken down from their channel for,
[154.22 → 155.06] and I quote,
[155.66 → 158.28] dangerous and harmful content.
[158.28 → 164.74] The video in question showed Ersatz TV, a program that lets you convert your Plex, MB,
[165.00 → 168.60] or Jellyfin library into a live TV channel.
[168.60 → 174.46] Space Invader 1 states that they are sure to never include copyrighted content,
[174.96 → 180.80] and in this case, even used public domain films such as The Brain That Wouldn't Die.
[181.30 → 181.66] Amazing.
[182.14 → 184.46] Since this takedown, they have requested an appeal,
[184.72 → 188.20] with no further update on whether this was resolved.
[188.86 → 192.34] They did say the video is still up on their Patreon for free,
[192.44 → 195.92] in case you guys are interested in seeing it and supporting.
[195.92 → 199.44] Our discussion question here from the one and only Elijah Horner is,
[200.02 → 204.40] feels like we know what the real reason was for this video being taken down,
[204.52 → 208.60] considering that we had our part two of Google your life taken down
[208.60 → 212.12] for showcasing an ad-free workaround for YouTube.
[214.02 → 217.66] Would it be better if Google just told you the reasoning outright,
[218.06 → 220.34] rather than saying dangerous and harmful,
[220.34 → 223.22] or is there a reason for them to keep this vague?
[224.42 → 225.88] Uh, there's definitely a reason.
[226.14 → 228.06] There's absolutely a reason.
[228.70 → 231.34] Uh, you never, if you want...
[233.08 → 237.30] Whenever you're trying to moderate a social platform,
[237.58 → 240.22] you can't be too specific about the rules,
[240.46 → 241.98] because all that does...
[241.98 → 243.60] I mean, we saw this with Twitch.
[244.08 → 244.68] Right.
[244.68 → 249.42] Twitch tries to implement some rules of what you couldn't do in regard to sexually...
[249.42 → 250.80] You've got to be, you know,
[251.10 → 255.42] at least within four inches of your chin for your neckline.
[255.90 → 258.98] And so you'll have people at 3.9 inches,
[259.26 → 262.78] or they'll get a chin extension, you know, injection,
[263.16 → 266.54] so that they can wear a slightly lower shirt or whatever, right?
[266.54 → 266.82] Or whatever.
[266.92 → 267.68] Like, I know some person...
[268.26 → 268.48] Right.
[268.48 → 272.16] Uh, wore really tight-fitting green clothes,
[272.34 → 274.56] and then green-screened the game onto the clothes,
[274.66 → 276.62] so you couldn't actually see them wearing any clothes,
[276.70 → 278.82] so it gave the illusion that they were...
[278.82 → 282.04] Like, people will find a way, no matter what.
[282.12 → 284.48] There is as many examples of this as you want.
[284.58 → 287.12] This is with standard everyday law.
[287.48 → 289.74] This is with rules on platforms, whatever.
[289.94 → 291.44] So if you're vague, and you're just like,
[291.44 → 293.56] you broke a rule, bad,
[294.12 → 296.84] then it's harder for those people to try to gamify
[296.84 → 298.66] working around the rules.
[298.76 → 298.96] Right.
[299.06 → 302.58] So why don't we try to dig into why they care...
[302.58 → 302.64] I don't know how to create them.
[302.64 → 303.36] I don't know who it was.
[303.40 → 304.34] ...why they care about this,
[304.38 → 306.54] because here's a funny thing,
[306.64 → 310.84] and I am probably about to get myself into trouble here,
[310.84 → 311.42] because...
[311.42 → 311.74] Nice.
[311.96 → 312.50] Let's go.
[312.70 → 314.30] Yeah, I mean, you know what?
[314.46 → 316.26] We're pretty deep into the show at this point.
[316.42 → 317.48] I think realistically,
[318.04 → 320.34] most people probably aren't watching anymore.
[321.60 → 323.60] Windows Free Linus.
[324.50 → 324.94] Okay.
[324.94 → 326.88] Here's this guy.
[327.10 → 328.06] Look at this hair.
[328.74 → 332.14] I mean, can you imagine being in your late 30s
[332.14 → 333.28] and doing this?
[333.34 → 334.22] What is this bracelet?
[334.68 → 336.04] Okay, the point is, it doesn't matter.
[336.72 → 338.10] Are you paying too much for windows?
[338.36 → 340.58] He's wearing this pirate hat.
[340.84 → 341.26] Free.
[341.60 → 342.32] Free windows.
[342.56 → 343.82] I think whoever dyed your hair there
[343.82 → 344.90] did a perfect job.
[344.96 → 345.42] Quality.
[346.02 → 347.08] Quality job.
[347.22 → 347.40] Yeah.
[347.40 → 349.68] That video was uploaded,
[350.26 → 351.14] I think,
[351.56 → 352.30] a day
[352.30 → 354.60] after our warning
[354.60 → 357.08] for D-Google Your Life Part 2
[357.08 → 358.26] expired,
[358.50 → 359.88] because if we had
[359.88 → 362.40] uploaded something to do with
[362.40 → 363.56] piracy,
[363.78 → 364.02] which...
[364.02 → 364.26] Sure.
[364.44 → 364.98] By the way,
[365.08 → 365.32] Google,
[365.56 → 366.52] just to let you know,
[366.86 → 368.38] 100% agrees with me
[368.38 → 369.52] that AdBlock is piracy.
[369.60 → 371.96] They're real clear on that.
[372.20 → 373.60] Wow, I wasn't sure about that one.
[373.60 → 374.12] Yeah, well,
[374.42 → 376.40] no, that was one of the big arguments
[376.40 → 377.40] for why I was wrong.
[377.92 → 378.14] Oh.
[378.24 → 379.56] Like, back when I first said that.
[379.78 → 380.90] Like, well, Google doesn't.
[381.06 → 382.24] Yeah, they do.
[382.56 → 383.28] They definitely do.
[383.30 → 384.06] They have the extension
[384.06 → 385.28] so that they can stay competitive,
[385.42 → 386.26] not because they like it.
[386.52 → 388.90] So our video,
[389.52 → 391.00] D-Googling Your Life Part 2,
[391.08 → 392.26] was taken down
[392.26 → 394.94] because of specific instructions,
[395.42 → 396.36] which I don't even know
[396.36 → 397.88] if we got that deep into it,
[397.96 → 399.38] but basically talking about
[399.38 → 401.10] circumventing ads on YouTube.
[401.86 → 403.14] And the justification,
[403.14 → 404.00] given to me,
[404.06 → 405.66] was that it was because
[405.66 → 408.28] it was anything around
[408.28 → 409.88] breaking a digital lock
[409.88 → 411.00] was essentially,
[411.72 → 412.78] sorry, dangerous, harmful,
[413.06 → 414.04] can't have it on the platform.
[414.26 → 414.48] Really?
[414.60 → 417.30] So we waited 91 days
[417.30 → 419.56] or whatever the number was.
[419.60 → 420.02] I don't remember.
[420.14 → 421.38] 92 days or something.
[421.46 → 423.16] Basically, we had this video done
[423.16 → 426.02] when D-Googling Your Life Part 2 went up,
[426.40 → 427.60] but we held it
[427.60 → 429.60] until our,
[429.84 → 430.12] not a
[430.22 → 431.00] it wasn't a strike,
[431.00 → 432.80] but until our warning expired.
[432.80 → 434.34] So that we wouldn't accumulate
[434.34 → 435.00] two warnings
[435.00 → 436.50] because I think the third one,
[436.62 → 437.84] you're actually in serious trouble
[437.84 → 438.98] and you end up with like a strike
[438.98 → 440.18] or a channel suspension
[440.18 → 440.96] or something like that.
[440.96 → 441.94] Or maybe it's the second one.
[442.02 → 443.06] Don't quote me on that details.
[443.26 → 444.04] The point is,
[444.10 → 445.44] we didn't want two warnings.
[446.60 → 448.02] We didn't even want one warning.
[448.86 → 450.02] I don't know why I'm talking about
[450.02 → 450.68] this right now then.
[450.68 → 452.32] So,
[452.64 → 454.50] this video
[454.50 → 456.48] contains
[456.48 → 458.90] pretty specific instructions
[458.90 → 461.58] on how to obtain Windows for free.
[464.28 → 466.36] Why doesn't YouTube care?
[467.10 → 468.60] So, my theory at the time,
[468.78 → 470.38] because we've talked about
[470.38 → 471.82] piracy lots,
[472.22 → 473.54] my theory at the time
[473.54 → 474.86] was the only reason
[474.86 → 476.86] that D-Google Your Life Part 2,
[476.86 → 477.94] you know,
[478.26 → 479.28] ruffled their
[479.28 → 480.62] undergarments
[480.62 → 482.42] was that it was specifically
[482.42 → 483.32] around YouTube,
[483.50 → 484.66] around their platform.
[485.86 → 487.52] I can't figure out
[487.52 → 488.14] where this
[488.14 → 489.80] ersatz TV thing
[489.80 → 491.16] falls into that
[491.16 → 491.70] because I,
[491.70 → 493.00] I doubt it has anything
[493.00 → 493.90] to do with people
[493.90 → 495.38] wanting to broadcast YouTube.
[495.48 → 495.62] I mean,
[495.64 → 496.46] the whole point
[496.46 → 497.20] of YouTube
[497.20 → 497.90] is that it's,
[497.98 → 498.82] it's on demand.
[498.98 → 500.16] It's not like a
[500.16 → 500.90] like a streaming
[500.90 → 501.90] service.
[501.90 → 503.90] and the kind of piracy
[503.90 → 504.82] that it seems like
[504.82 → 505.90] they are concerned about.
[506.12 → 506.90] I promise you
[506.90 → 508.52] there are auto-downloader scripts
[508.52 → 509.26] for Plex
[509.26 → 510.48] that scrape YouTube channels.
[510.62 → 511.04] Sure,
[511.16 → 512.20] but what would be the point
[512.20 → 512.96] of watching that?
[513.04 → 514.04] It would be far more
[514.04 → 515.12] of a waste of your time
[515.12 → 516.44] to sit through
[516.44 → 517.78] a bunch of
[517.78 → 519.30] video from that channel
[519.30 → 520.42] that you don't want to watch
[520.42 → 521.40] in order to get to the one
[521.40 → 522.18] you want to watch
[522.18 → 523.24] versus just
[523.24 → 524.26] sitting through the ad
[524.26 → 524.78] on YouTube.
[526.08 → 527.60] Because this is for streaming.
[529.32 → 529.72] Oh.
[530.00 → 530.28] Yeah.
[531.02 → 531.30] Yeah.
[531.90 → 533.26] So like,
[533.38 → 535.22] there's no real threat
[535.22 → 536.22] to YouTube here.
[536.36 → 537.48] The main threat
[537.48 → 538.92] is probably more
[538.92 → 539.68] along the lines
[539.68 → 540.98] of enabling
[540.98 → 542.44] people who run
[542.44 → 543.52] like pirate
[543.52 → 544.62] video streaming
[544.62 → 545.82] subscription services.
[546.06 → 547.36] Like having a movie,
[547.44 → 548.58] a Disney movie channel
[548.58 → 550.00] that you have,
[550.08 → 550.22] you know,
[550.28 → 551.04] people in your,
[551.12 → 552.26] in your social circle.
[552.46 → 553.54] You advertise on
[553.54 → 554.90] Facebook Marketplace
[554.90 → 555.48] or Craigslist
[555.48 → 555.90] or whatever.
[555.90 → 556.84] I don't think that's the case.
[557.04 → 557.96] It's totally a thing.
[558.22 → 558.46] No,
[558.56 → 559.72] I think this is downloading
[559.72 → 560.70] Gods for sure.
[560.70 → 562.74] It says,
[562.96 → 563.30] make your own
[563.30 → 564.56] live TV channel.
[564.68 → 565.88] But I think they would do that
[565.88 → 567.10] by downloading Gods
[567.10 → 567.56] and then
[567.56 → 569.54] mixing them into a live feed.
[569.66 → 570.62] So you're still downloading
[570.62 → 571.42] things from YouTube
[571.42 → 572.26] and then playing them
[572.26 → 572.88] somewhere else.
[574.42 → 575.32] But if you wanted
[575.32 → 576.16] to do that,
[576.20 → 577.22] then why wouldn't you
[577.22 → 578.66] just share your Plex library?
[578.84 → 579.88] Am I missing something here?
[579.98 → 580.60] Please tell me
[580.60 → 581.60] if I'm missing something here.
[581.68 → 581.84] They want to be based on
[581.84 → 582.48] YouTube videos.
[582.90 → 583.16] I don't,
[583.20 → 584.10] I don't think it's like,
[584.16 → 585.58] is there a better option
[585.58 → 586.60] or not necessarily?
[586.60 → 587.94] I think at its core
[587.94 → 588.76] they were downloading
[588.76 → 589.54] YouTube videos
[589.54 → 590.48] and then having them
[590.48 → 592.14] play in effectively
[592.14 → 592.82] random order
[592.82 → 593.66] off of your own thing.
[594.62 → 594.76] Yeah,
[594.82 → 594.98] no,
[595.12 → 596.28] it's enjoy your own,
[596.52 → 597.28] build your own
[597.28 → 598.38] live TV channels.
[598.50 → 598.78] So it's,
[598.82 → 599.48] it's like this
[599.48 → 600.38] with like programming
[600.38 → 601.96] and it's like
[601.96 → 603.48] at a scheduled time.
[603.82 → 604.26] Yeah,
[604.82 → 605.90] but they're YouTube videos.
[606.04 → 607.04] They're not live streams.
[608.78 → 609.26] Well,
[609.30 → 609.48] no,
[609.58 → 611.42] their thing is a live stream,
[611.54 → 612.34] but what you're downloading
[612.34 → 613.10] is YouTube videos.
[613.16 → 613.98] So it still fits in the
[613.98 → 615.24] reason why you think
[615.24 → 616.18] our video is taken down
[616.18 → 616.90] because it shows you
[616.90 → 617.32] how to download
[617.32 → 617.86] YouTube videos.
[619.42 → 619.86] Uh,
[619.98 → 620.28] okay,
[620.32 → 621.56] but I don't think he's,
[621.70 → 622.76] but he wasn't talking
[622.76 → 623.68] about YouTube videos
[623.68 → 624.20] and I don't think
[624.20 → 625.08] that's what most people
[625.08 → 626.06] are using this for
[626.06 → 627.00] because like,
[627.12 → 628.10] why would you do that?
[628.22 → 629.06] Why would you want,
[629.38 → 629.98] why would you want
[629.98 → 631.04] this experience
[631.04 → 632.46] for YouTube videos?
[632.60 → 634.00] It would be just worse.
[634.08 → 634.86] Even just look
[634.86 → 635.72] at their example.
[635.86 → 636.80] This is all
[636.80 → 639.12] traditional media.
[639.42 → 641.12] Like this is not YouTube.
[641.32 → 641.98] This is not what
[641.98 → 642.64] I would think
[642.64 → 643.62] anyone would be
[643.62 → 644.74] doing with this
[644.74 → 647.24] and I suspect
[647.24 → 649.28] that the people
[649.28 → 650.24] who are trying
[650.24 → 650.88] to use this
[650.88 → 651.38] in any kind
[651.38 → 652.40] of commercial fashion
[652.40 → 653.70] are more trying
[653.70 → 654.66] to monetize
[654.66 → 656.54] this like live TV
[656.54 → 657.54] experience.
[658.14 → 658.34] So given,
[658.34 → 659.00] this had nothing,
[659.24 → 660.68] given that it doesn't
[660.68 → 662.20] threaten YouTube's
[662.20 → 662.86] own content,
[662.96 → 663.28] I'm just,
[663.52 → 665.56] I'm a little surprised
[665.56 → 666.56] that they care.
[666.68 → 667.66] I made a bad assumption
[667.66 → 668.60] that this had something
[668.60 → 669.54] to do at all
[669.54 → 670.04] with YouTube.
[670.08 → 670.30] No.
[670.30 → 671.68] Yeah,
[671.68 → 672.26] I don't get it
[672.26 → 673.20] even slightly then.
[673.38 → 673.48] No,
[673.58 → 674.76] turning your Plex library
[674.76 → 676.64] into TV channels
[676.64 → 677.64] is what
[677.64 → 678.68] Ersatz TV does.
[680.22 → 681.42] If I had to,
[681.60 → 681.82] if I,
[681.90 → 682.14] okay,
[682.26 → 682.62] this is,
[682.70 → 683.50] this is pretty good
[683.50 → 684.06] from chat.
[684.22 → 685.80] So maybe
[685.80 → 687.36] they got a cease and desist.
[687.42 → 688.32] Like maybe this was
[688.32 → 688.92] one of the more
[688.92 → 689.80] traditional content
[689.80 → 690.76] providers that basically
[690.76 → 691.00] went,
[691.12 → 691.30] hey,
[691.96 → 693.52] you all need to remove
[693.52 → 693.78] this.
[693.96 → 693.98] Yeah,
[693.98 → 694.28] maybe.
[694.28 → 696.88] But then again,
[697.00 → 697.68] like you said,
[698.16 → 699.46] he used stuff like
[699.46 → 700.30] the brain that wouldn't
[700.30 → 700.66] die.
[701.62 → 701.86] Yeah.
[702.12 → 702.44] So you,
[702.86 → 703.94] and like I also,
[703.94 → 704.68] it feels like he did
[704.68 → 705.80] this all above board.
[705.98 → 707.20] And like I also said,
[707.54 → 708.64] where's my takedown
[708.64 → 709.26] for this then?
[709.50 → 709.82] Yeah.
[710.20 → 710.52] So is it,
[710.64 → 711.34] look at this guy.
[712.30 → 713.30] How could you not?
[713.38 → 713.66] Look at,
[713.72 → 714.44] look at that shifty
[714.44 → 715.20] eyed mother f***er.
[715.26 → 715.76] Wouldn't you want to,
[715.82 → 716.20] wouldn't you just
[716.20 → 717.42] automatically want to
[717.42 → 718.10] take his videos down?
[718.12 → 718.36] Yeah,
[718.36 → 718.70] right?
[720.38 → 721.30] This is weird.
[724.28 → 726.48] I just,
[726.54 → 727.44] I just applied what
[727.44 → 728.58] happened to us to it
[728.58 → 729.66] and assumed.
[730.16 → 730.54] No.
[731.40 → 731.78] Oh,
[731.82 → 732.62] here's a fun one.
[734.22 → 735.50] This might not be good
[735.50 → 736.38] to bring attention here.
[736.46 → 736.64] Sorry,
[736.76 → 736.94] Lon,
[737.08 → 738.42] but Lon TV,
[738.82 → 739.82] a full point guy
[739.82 → 740.10] actually,
[740.34 → 742.20] has a video on
[742.20 → 743.18] my streaming channel
[743.18 → 743.86] with Plex and
[743.86 → 744.52] Airbags TV.
[745.14 → 746.00] Four months ago,
[746.04 → 746.56] it's still up.
[747.80 → 749.32] It just feels like,
[750.50 → 751.04] and I,
[751.20 → 751.38] look,
[751.48 → 752.72] I know it's
[752.72 → 753.88] probably not
[753.88 → 754.40] targeted,
[754.70 → 756.28] but it can't help
[756.28 → 757.00] but feel a little
[757.00 → 758.00] targeted when
[758.00 → 759.40] finding a video
[759.40 → 760.18] on this topic
[760.18 → 762.12] from four months ago
[762.12 → 763.92] was as easy
[763.92 → 764.74] as you just
[764.74 → 765.66] searching for it
[765.66 → 766.16] like that.
[766.28 → 766.54] Yeah.
[769.72 → 770.24] Well,
[770.56 → 771.68] good luck us
[771.68 → 772.92] and good luck
[772.92 → 773.76] everybody else.
[774.12 → 775.08] And if you guys
[775.08 → 775.64] want to check out
[775.64 → 776.06] the video,
[776.22 → 777.36] you can head over
[777.36 → 779.74] to Space Invader 1's
[779.74 → 780.18] Patreon,
[780.44 → 781.14] where that video
[781.14 → 781.84] is still up.
[782.00 → 782.88] If you ever want
[782.88 → 783.50] to watch
[783.50 → 784.36] Google Your Life
[784.36 → 785.04] Part 2,
[785.60 → 786.88] I don't actually
[786.88 → 787.68] think we did
[787.68 → 788.16] leave it up
[788.16 → 789.38] on Float plane.
[790.18 → 790.64] Did we?
[792.68 → 793.98] That is a good
[793.98 → 794.32] question.
[794.32 → 794.50] Part 2,
[794.62 → 794.90] it's up.
[795.54 → 796.12] Part 2's up.
[796.54 → 796.80] Oh,
[796.86 → 797.10] okay.
[797.52 → 797.74] Yep.
[797.88 → 798.34] Are you sure?
[798.50 → 799.02] 100%.
[799.02 → 801.06] You're 100% sure?
[801.12 → 802.06] I am 100% sure.
[802.06 → 802.54] Oh,
[802.54 → 806.82] good.
[807.34 → 807.66] Okay.
[808.42 → 808.76] Neat.
[808.98 → 809.18] Well,
[809.34 → 810.34] that's up on,
[810.38 → 810.60] oh yeah,
[810.66 → 811.02] there it is.
[811.38 → 811.70] Cool.
[812.42 → 812.92] So that's up
[812.92 → 813.48] on Float plane.
[814.04 → 814.52] Oh yeah,
[814.56 → 815.36] our search is not
[815.36 → 815.80] the greatest.
[815.96 → 816.90] There's a fun trick
[816.90 → 817.98] if you put it in quotes,
[818.22 → 819.58] it immediately works
[819.58 → 821.14] wildly better.
[821.28 → 821.92] We know what's wrong.
[822.04 → 822.90] We'll get to fixing it.
[824.02 → 824.38] Nope,
[824.50 → 824.88] didn't work.
[825.54 → 826.12] You just put
[826.12 → 827.02] Google in quotes
[827.02 → 827.48] and it didn't work
[827.48 → 827.94] because I've done this
[827.94 → 828.62] like five times
[828.62 → 829.32] this show so far.
[829.32 → 829.62] No,
[829.78 → 830.58] because I didn't put
[830.58 → 831.06] Google,
[831.14 → 831.52] I just put
[831.52 → 832.40] Google your life.
[832.86 → 833.08] Oh.
[833.20 → 834.02] So it brought up
[834.02 → 835.22] probably any video
[835.22 → 836.08] that had the words
[836.08 → 837.36] Google your and life
[837.36 → 838.36] anywhere in the title,
[838.54 → 839.46] comments and description
[839.46 → 840.24] would be my guess,
[840.30 → 840.42] right?
[840.52 → 840.92] That is,
[841.36 → 842.08] it's been a long time
[842.08 → 842.52] since I've looked
[842.52 → 843.20] into our search,
[843.66 → 844.04] maybe,
[844.60 → 845.46] but yeah,
[845.56 → 846.32] Google would have
[846.32 → 847.24] worked for you.
[847.54 → 847.76] Cool.
[848.68 → 849.20] All right,
[849.22 → 850.02] what's next?
[850.40 → 850.80] What do you want
[850.80 → 851.28] to talk about,
[851.34 → 851.54] Dan?
[851.54 → 851.58] Dan,
[851.58 → 852.70] we're going to mix it up.
[853.36 → 853.80] Dan,
[854.14 → 855.18] choose our next topic.
[855.80 → 856.16] Oh,
[856.28 → 856.84] we're going to talk
[856.84 → 857.58] about Windows 11.
[859.32 → 860.74] Because I'm not moving over.
[861.38 → 861.78] Yeah,
[861.88 → 862.10] good.
[862.78 → 863.30] Ever.
[864.02 → 864.48] Good.
[865.12 → 865.96] I'm waiting for 12.
[868.16 → 870.38] You know that the past
[870.38 → 871.58] pattern of like
[871.58 → 872.30] good Windows,
[872.46 → 873.10] crappy Windows,
[873.26 → 873.68] good Windows,
[873.86 → 874.54] crappy Windows
[874.54 → 876.92] is not an indication
[876.92 → 878.12] of future good Windows.
[879.18 → 880.12] Prove me wrong,
[880.24 → 880.58] Windows.
[881.02 → 881.66] I mean,
[881.90 → 883.18] don't tempt them.
[883.32 → 883.96] Prove you right.
[884.34 → 884.86] Prove him wrong.
[885.46 → 886.20] I'm just going back,
[886.36 → 886.82] backwards,
[886.98 → 887.78] I'm going back to seven.
[887.78 → 889.02] Good,
[889.44 → 889.78] good.
[890.42 → 891.06] Microsoft
[891.06 → 892.60] is blocking
[892.60 → 893.78] more ways
[893.78 → 894.64] to set up
[894.64 → 895.36] a Windows 11
[895.36 → 896.32] local account.
[896.70 → 897.50] When announcing
[897.50 → 898.18] Windows 11
[898.18 → 898.90] Insider Preview
[898.90 → 902.04] builds 26120.6772,
[902.46 → 903.26] Microsoft revealed
[903.26 → 903.90] that they are
[903.90 → 904.74] removing
[904.74 → 906.18] known mechanisms
[906.18 → 907.32] for setting up
[907.32 → 908.20] an offline
[908.20 → 909.66] or local account.
[910.32 → 911.20] Microsoft says
[911.20 → 912.78] users will need
[912.78 → 913.32] to complete
[913.32 → 913.94] their Windows 11
[913.94 → 914.74] setup with
[914.74 → 915.54] an internet connection
[915.54 → 916.42] and with
[916.42 → 917.16] a Microsoft
[917.16 → 917.90] account.
[919.10 → 919.96] As you would
[919.96 → 920.74] probably expect,
[921.28 → 922.28] it was not long
[922.28 → 922.92] before folks
[922.92 → 923.60] started to make
[923.60 → 924.22] workarounds.
[924.74 → 926.36] And Notebook Check,
[926.58 → 928.90] who we were reading
[928.90 → 929.86] when we were
[929.86 → 931.04] looking at this
[931.04 → 931.86] development,
[932.26 → 933.38] already has some
[933.38 → 934.56] examples of how
[934.56 → 935.20] to make a local
[935.20 → 936.54] account on Windows
[936.54 → 938.50] 11's new build.
[938.68 → 939.30] So if you guys
[939.30 → 940.74] want to head on
[940.74 → 940.92] over,
[940.98 → 941.66] I'm not saying,
[942.08 → 942.34] look,
[942.94 → 943.50] Google,
[943.50 → 945.30] just calm down.
[945.98 → 946.90] You have a little
[946.90 → 947.34] relaxed.
[947.42 → 948.18] I think you should.
[948.28 → 948.94] I think you should
[948.94 → 949.74] go read the article
[949.74 → 950.38] and I think you
[950.38 → 951.06] should make a local
[951.06 → 951.40] account.
[951.56 → 952.54] I am not providing
[952.54 → 953.06] anyone with
[953.06 → 953.94] instructions to
[953.94 → 954.46] anything.
[954.62 → 955.22] I think you should
[955.22 → 955.48] do it.
[955.50 → 957.40] This is Notebook Check,
[957.50 → 958.34] an unaffiliated
[958.34 → 959.40] website with which
[959.40 → 960.92] I have nothing to do.
[961.46 → 963.16] I don't even know
[963.16 → 964.98] if they have ever
[964.98 → 966.36] even associated
[966.36 → 967.48] with me in any way.
[968.02 → 968.66] Maybe they said
[968.66 → 969.58] mean things about me.
[970.12 → 971.04] I literally don't
[971.04 → 971.28] know.
[971.64 → 972.62] What I do know
[972.62 → 974.02] is that this is
[974.02 → 975.58] not a page that
[975.58 → 976.32] you should ever
[976.32 → 977.04] look up.
[978.96 → 979.48] There.
[980.24 → 980.86] Please don't
[980.86 → 981.54] take down my
[981.54 → 982.10] when shown.
[986.40 → 987.28] Discussion question.
[987.38 → 988.00] Aside from simply
[988.00 → 988.66] allowing local
[988.66 → 988.98] accounts,
[989.06 → 989.52] what can Microsoft
[989.52 → 990.12] do to repair
[990.12 → 990.88] Windows 11's
[990.88 → 991.74] public image?
[992.52 → 993.04] I mean,
[994.00 → 994.30] oh,
[994.42 → 994.64] dude,
[994.78 → 994.98] I mean,
[995.08 → 995.74] like,
[995.82 → 996.18] where do you
[996.18 → 996.46] even,
[996.88 → 997.84] where do you
[997.84 → 998.54] even start
[998.54 → 1000.10] with stuff like
[1000.10 → 1000.44] that?
[1000.82 → 1001.02] Right?
[1001.02 → 1001.40] like here,
[1001.58 → 1002.42] let's try a
[1002.42 → 1002.66] thing.
[1003.12 → 1003.92] Let's try a
[1003.92 → 1004.74] thing for fun.
[1005.64 → 1006.28] Tell me
[1006.28 → 1008.00] something that
[1008.00 → 1010.48] might be on
[1010.48 → 1011.44] my computer
[1011.44 → 1012.40] that I could
[1012.40 → 1013.02] search for.
[1013.22 → 1013.82] I can tell you
[1013.82 → 1014.46] things I wish were
[1014.46 → 1014.90] on your computer
[1014.90 → 1015.24] that you could
[1015.24 → 1015.64] search for.
[1015.98 → 1016.86] What happened to
[1016.86 → 1017.76] local games without
[1017.76 → 1018.20] ads?
[1020.86 → 1021.26] Okay.
[1022.08 → 1022.48] Something.
[1022.86 → 1023.18] Notepad.
[1023.90 → 1024.74] That'll show up.
[1024.94 → 1025.42] That'll work.
[1025.48 → 1025.66] Yeah.
[1025.80 → 1026.10] Okay.
[1026.10 → 1026.60] That worked
[1026.60 → 1027.08] immediately.
[1027.44 → 1027.72] Okay.
[1027.82 → 1028.50] Bad example.
[1032.06 → 1032.86] Usually it's
[1032.86 → 1034.06] individual files
[1034.06 → 1034.60] that I wouldn't
[1034.60 → 1035.20] know you have
[1035.20 → 1035.68] on your computer
[1035.68 → 1036.12] that doesn't
[1036.12 → 1036.82] immediately search
[1036.82 → 1037.10] up.
[1037.16 → 1037.26] Well,
[1037.30 → 1037.78] let's find out
[1037.78 → 1038.38] what files I
[1038.38 → 1038.86] have on my
[1038.86 → 1039.26] computer.
[1039.40 → 1039.98] Probably not
[1039.98 → 1040.70] a ton because
[1040.70 → 1040.92] they're
[1040.92 → 1041.86] laptops.
[1042.86 → 1043.30] Yeah,
[1043.38 → 1043.72] that's,
[1043.80 → 1045.40] that's true.
[1045.42 → 1045.58] This is not
[1045.58 → 1045.98] going to be
[1045.98 → 1046.58] an amazing
[1046.58 → 1047.12] example,
[1047.52 → 1047.98] but I'm
[1047.98 → 1048.60] pretty sure
[1048.60 → 1049.44] everybody has
[1049.44 → 1050.28] experienced this
[1050.28 → 1050.88] so we can
[1050.88 → 1051.52] just tell them
[1051.52 → 1051.92] what you're
[1051.92 → 1052.36] talking about.
[1052.54 → 1052.64] Okay.
[1052.74 → 1053.00] Okay.
[1053.06 → 1053.24] Hold on.
[1053.24 → 1053.48] Basically,
[1053.56 → 1053.76] when you
[1053.76 → 1054.10] search for
[1054.10 → 1054.46] things on
[1054.46 → 1055.30] Windows and
[1055.30 → 1055.58] you can
[1055.58 → 1056.42] disable this.
[1056.72 → 1056.90] Oh,
[1056.96 → 1057.06] hey,
[1057.14 → 1057.48] it found,
[1057.62 → 1058.16] it found my
[1058.16 → 1058.86] favourite Luke
[1058.86 → 1059.22] meme.
[1064.34 → 1064.78] Okay,
[1064.88 → 1065.30] you know what?
[1065.32 → 1065.68] The search
[1065.68 → 1066.28] actually worked
[1066.28 → 1066.76] pretty okay
[1066.76 → 1066.96] there,
[1067.04 → 1068.78] but there's
[1068.78 → 1070.82] definitely times
[1070.82 → 1071.32] when it doesn't
[1071.32 → 1072.00] work too good.
[1078.54 → 1079.06] All right,
[1079.10 → 1079.44] why don't we
[1079.44 → 1079.92] move on?
[1080.60 → 1081.10] My goodness.
[1082.22 → 1082.54] Oh,
[1082.60 → 1082.74] yeah,
[1082.74 → 1083.06] what could
[1083.06 → 1083.30] they do
[1083.30 → 1083.60] to fix
[1083.60 → 1083.94] the image?
[1084.04 → 1084.30] I mean,
[1084.38 → 1084.58] okay,
[1084.68 → 1085.06] fix the
[1085.06 → 1085.36] search.
[1086.90 → 1087.26] Well,
[1087.44 → 1088.02] maybe it's
[1088.02 → 1088.38] great.
[1089.60 → 1089.98] Yeah,
[1090.18 → 1090.50] okay,
[1090.62 → 1091.22] permanently
[1091.22 → 1091.94] fix the
[1091.94 → 1092.06] search.
[1092.08 → 1092.42] We should
[1092.42 → 1093.30] do a
[1093.30 → 1095.06] do a
[1095.06 → 1095.62] labs thing.
[1096.00 → 1096.10] Does
[1096.10 → 1096.34] Windows
[1096.34 → 1096.86] search still
[1096.86 → 1097.16] suck?
[1097.92 → 1098.44] I don't
[1098.44 → 1098.72] know if
[1098.72 → 1099.06] you would
[1099.06 → 1099.46] prove it
[1099.46 → 1099.80] one way
[1099.80 → 1100.02] or the
[1100.02 → 1100.22] other,
[1100.28 → 1100.84] unfortunately.
[1102.20 → 1102.48] You could
[1102.48 → 1102.96] do a lot
[1102.96 → 1103.42] of dive.
[1103.56 → 1103.64] Yeah,
[1103.70 → 1104.02] but from
[1104.02 → 1104.86] one machine
[1104.86 → 1105.32] to the
[1105.32 → 1105.62] next,
[1105.72 → 1105.98] sometimes
[1105.98 → 1106.36] you'll
[1106.36 → 1106.76] have a
[1106.76 → 1107.32] pretty
[1107.32 → 1107.66] different
[1107.66 → 1108.16] experience.
[1108.52 → 1108.54] Like,
[1108.60 → 1109.68] from one
[1109.68 → 1111.14] search to
[1111.14 → 1111.64] the next,
[1111.64 → 1112.48] I can
[1112.48 → 1112.86] type the
[1112.86 → 1113.16] same
[1113.16 → 1115.16] characters
[1115.16 → 1115.90] and it
[1115.90 → 1116.06] will
[1116.06 → 1116.88] literally
[1116.88 → 1118.58] like,
[1118.78 → 1119.18] oh man,
[1119.26 → 1119.56] what was
[1119.56 → 1120.32] one that
[1120.32 → 1120.68] would happen
[1120.68 → 1121.00] all the
[1121.00 → 1121.44] time for
[1121.44 → 1121.60] me?
[1121.68 → 1122.04] Because I
[1122.04 → 1122.40] had two
[1122.40 → 1123.00] applications
[1123.00 → 1123.50] that had
[1123.50 → 1124.08] the first
[1124.08 → 1124.56] three or
[1124.56 → 1125.50] four letters
[1125.50 → 1126.10] in common.
[1126.32 → 1127.04] That one's
[1127.04 → 1127.38] rough.
[1127.66 → 1128.06] Ah,
[1128.22 → 1128.44] yeah,
[1128.48 → 1128.78] that one's
[1128.78 → 1129.22] really rough
[1129.22 → 1130.08] when the
[1130.08 → 1130.60] one that
[1130.60 → 1131.06] it's auto
[1131.06 → 1131.48] selecting
[1131.48 → 1132.56] will change
[1132.56 → 1133.64] after you
[1133.64 → 1134.40] finish typing.
[1134.40 → 1135.26] even though
[1135.26 → 1136.08] they both
[1136.08 → 1136.84] share all
[1136.84 → 1137.38] the same
[1137.38 → 1138.00] letters,
[1138.16 → 1138.40] it will
[1138.40 → 1138.60] like,
[1138.72 → 1139.00] randomly
[1139.00 → 1139.44] change
[1139.44 → 1139.74] when you
[1139.74 → 1140.08] type one
[1140.08 → 1140.46] more letter.
[1140.54 → 1140.80] It's just
[1140.80 → 1141.26] bizarre.
[1141.84 → 1142.08] What is
[1142.08 → 1142.56] the name
[1142.56 → 1142.84] of,
[1143.02 → 1143.52] uh,
[1148.08 → 1148.40] Battle
[1148.40 → 1148.80] State.
[1149.02 → 1149.38] So,
[1149.64 → 1150.32] I would
[1150.32 → 1150.60] try to
[1150.60 → 1151.10] open the
[1151.10 → 1151.36] Battle
[1151.36 → 1151.62] State
[1151.62 → 1151.90] launcher
[1151.90 → 1152.34] back in
[1152.34 → 1152.56] the day.
[1152.70 → 1152.84] Right.
[1152.98 → 1153.26] I couldn't
[1153.26 → 1153.54] remember the
[1153.54 → 1153.72] name of
[1153.72 → 1154.00] the company.
[1154.10 → 1154.26] It's been
[1154.26 → 1154.50] a while.
[1154.70 → 1155.06] But I
[1155.06 → 1155.30] tried to
[1155.30 → 1155.56] open the
[1155.56 → 1155.72] Battle
[1155.72 → 1155.92] State
[1155.92 → 1156.18] launcher
[1156.18 → 1156.40] to
[1156.40 → 1156.58] play
[1156.58 → 1157.06] Markov
[1157.06 → 1157.56] and I
[1157.56 → 1157.74] typed
[1157.74 → 1158.10] bat
[1158.10 → 1158.70] and it
[1158.70 → 1159.00] would show
[1159.00 → 1159.14] the
[1159.14 → 1159.36] Battle
[1159.36 → 1159.58] State
[1159.58 → 1159.88] launcher
[1159.88 → 1160.42] and
[1160.42 → 1160.58] then
[1160.58 → 1161.26] in the
[1161.26 → 1161.68] time
[1161.68 → 1161.96] that it
[1161.96 → 1162.20] takes
[1162.20 → 1162.40] for me
[1162.40 → 1162.54] to
[1162.54 → 1162.74] shift
[1162.74 → 1162.90] my
[1162.90 → 1163.06] hand
[1163.06 → 1163.20] over
[1163.20 → 1163.36] to
[1163.36 → 1163.70] enter
[1163.70 → 1164.18] it
[1164.18 → 1164.36] would
[1164.36 → 1164.70] switch
[1164.70 → 1164.94] to
[1164.94 → 1165.28] Battle
[1165.28 → 1165.58] Net
[1165.58 → 1166.04] and
[1166.04 → 1166.16] then
[1166.16 → 1166.28] I'd
[1166.28 → 1166.58] be like
[1166.58 → 1168.90] why?
[1169.46 → 1170.70] You can load it under
[1170.70 → 1171.26] or something.
[1171.56 → 1172.26] Is this pre
[1172.26 → 1173.02] or post
[1173.02 → 1173.64] Activision
[1173.64 → 1174.28] acquisition?
[1176.26 → 1176.96] Putting on my
[1176.96 → 1177.72] tinfoil hat.
[1177.80 → 1178.62] Definitely post.
[1178.98 → 1179.38] Oh,
[1179.70 → 1180.68] I knew it!
[1181.20 → 1182.56] I knew it!
[1183.62 → 1184.70] This is a good one.
[1185.02 → 1185.96] XD Stock
[1185.96 → 1186.56] in Float plane
[1186.56 → 1186.98] Chat says
[1186.98 → 1187.42] I tried to
[1187.42 → 1188.22] open PowerShell
[1188.22 → 1188.68] the other day
[1188.68 → 1189.18] and it web
[1189.18 → 1189.66] searched it
[1189.66 → 1190.04] instead.
[1190.44 → 1190.64] Oh.
[1190.92 → 1191.32] No!
[1191.68 → 1194.04] I don't know.
[1194.12 → 1194.38] It's just
[1194.38 → 1194.92] it's tough
[1194.92 → 1195.10] to
[1195.10 → 1195.68] it's the kind
[1195.68 → 1195.92] of thing
[1195.92 → 1196.48] that's really
[1196.48 → 1196.84] tough
[1196.84 → 1197.56] to replicate.
[1198.94 → 1199.24] Yeah.
[1200.84 → 1201.54] One of them
[1201.54 → 1202.14] was the new
[1202.14 → 1202.54] Windows 11
[1202.54 → 1203.40] preview build
[1203.40 → 1203.88] has folks
[1203.88 → 1204.26] wanted to
[1204.26 → 1204.74] jump ship
[1204.74 → 1205.14] so what
[1205.14 → 1205.46] advice
[1205.46 → 1205.70] would you
[1205.70 → 1206.14] give any
[1206.14 → 1206.48] Windows
[1206.48 → 1206.76] users
[1206.76 → 1207.14] considering
[1207.14 → 1208.36] swapping
[1208.36 → 1208.76] their OS
[1208.76 → 1209.32] in 2025?
[1212.68 → 1213.42] Do it.
[1213.88 → 1214.56] Some games
[1214.56 → 1215.08] are still a
[1215.08 → 1215.44] problem
[1215.44 → 1216.84] but send it.
[1217.10 → 1217.22] Yeah,
[1217.30 → 1217.98] give it a shot.
[1218.42 → 1218.54] Right?
[1218.78 → 1219.26] At least
[1219.26 → 1219.84] try.
[1220.22 → 1220.60] Here's a
[1220.60 → 1221.88] wild question.
[1223.46 → 1224.14] Do you
[1224.14 → 1224.58] need to
[1224.58 → 1224.96] play
[1224.96 → 1226.28] the games
[1226.28 → 1226.48] that are
[1226.48 → 1226.88] on Windows?
[1227.30 → 1227.46] Yeah,
[1227.48 → 1227.90] probably not.
[1227.98 → 1228.32] There's some
[1228.32 → 1228.76] like friend
[1228.76 → 1229.52] group issues.
[1229.98 → 1230.24] Yeah.
[1230.88 → 1231.24] I mean,
[1231.28 → 1231.82] you ran into
[1231.82 → 1232.34] that back
[1232.34 → 1232.74] when we did
[1232.74 → 1233.06] the Linux
[1233.06 → 1233.50] challenge a
[1233.50 → 1233.92] couple years
[1233.92 → 1234.26] ago.
[1234.48 → 1234.70] And it
[1234.70 → 1235.58] would again
[1235.58 → 1236.22] be a problem.
[1236.22 → 1236.62] What game was it?
[1237.62 → 1237.98] Battlefield,
[1238.16 → 1238.70] which is funny
[1238.70 → 1239.54] because if I did
[1239.54 → 1240.00] it now it would
[1240.00 → 1240.50] be Battlefield
[1240.50 → 1240.84] again.
[1240.84 → 1240.96] That's hilarious.
[1241.36 → 1241.56] Yeah.
[1241.56 → 1244.08] Nice.
[1244.28 → 1244.66] Was that
[1244.66 → 1245.46] Battlefield
[1245.46 → 1246.38] 2042?
[1246.74 → 1247.06] Okay.
[1247.06 → 1247.92] Which turns out
[1247.92 → 1248.78] not a big deal
[1248.78 → 1249.24] that I couldn't
[1249.24 → 1249.76] play that one.
[1249.80 → 1250.00] Right,
[1250.04 → 1250.26] but you're
[1250.26 → 1250.78] pretty psyched
[1250.78 → 1251.26] for Battlefield
[1251.26 → 1251.58] 6.
[1251.58 → 1251.60] Pretty psyched
[1251.60 → 1252.12] for 6.
[1252.46 → 1252.74] Yeah,
[1252.84 → 1253.04] okay.
[1253.06 → 1253.34] I think it
[1253.34 → 1253.72] comes out
[1253.72 → 1254.22] like tonight
[1254.22 → 1254.90] but I can't
[1254.90 → 1255.22] play because
[1255.22 → 1255.64] my computer's
[1255.64 → 1256.00] not set up
[1256.00 → 1256.30] anyway.
[1256.46 → 1256.72] Nice.
[1256.84 → 1257.14] And I have
[1257.14 → 1257.52] like things
[1257.52 → 1257.84] to do.
[1258.16 → 1258.48] Nice.
[1258.94 → 1259.68] But I will
[1259.68 → 1260.18] play eventually.
[1260.70 → 1261.22] Maybe I'll
[1261.22 → 1261.62] play it and
[1261.62 → 1262.08] think of you.
[1263.42 → 1263.96] I won't.
[1264.04 → 1264.22] I'll be
[1264.22 → 1264.54] playing the
[1264.54 → 1264.78] release
[1264.78 → 1265.28] Chronicles.
[1265.80 → 1266.44] The what?
[1266.88 → 1267.24] Oh,
[1267.32 → 1267.64] the Final
[1267.64 → 1268.24] Fantasy Tactics.
[1268.24 → 1268.32] Oh,
[1268.36 → 1268.54] right,
[1268.54 → 1268.76] right,
[1271.56 → 1273.32] I was
[1273.32 → 1273.64] working.
[1274.88 → 1275.32] Oh,
[1275.60 → 1276.08] Handyman
[1276.08 → 1276.52] figured it
[1276.52 → 1276.68] out.
[1276.76 → 1276.86] Yeah,
[1276.92 → 1277.08] it was
[1277.08 → 1277.52] Teams and
[1277.52 → 1277.96] TeamViewer
[1277.96 → 1279.00] was what
[1279.00 → 1279.24] I would
[1279.24 → 1279.68] always,
[1280.14 → 1280.82] it would
[1280.82 → 1281.42] like change.
[1281.86 → 1282.22] I'd type
[1282.22 → 1284.36] T-E-A
[1284.36 → 1285.20] and it
[1285.20 → 1285.40] would be
[1285.40 → 1286.20] like Team
[1286.20 → 1286.68] Viewer
[1286.68 → 1287.44] and I'd
[1287.44 → 1288.14] hit M
[1288.14 → 1288.70] and it'd
[1288.70 → 1289.02] be like,
[1289.70 → 1290.16] you mean
[1290.16 → 1290.46] Teams?
[1290.56 → 1290.80] And I'd
[1290.80 → 1291.80] hit enter
[1291.80 → 1292.76] because sometimes
[1292.76 → 1293.32] my typing
[1293.32 → 1293.96] just like has
[1293.96 → 1294.48] momentum.
[1294.84 → 1294.92] Yeah,
[1294.96 → 1295.26] of course.
[1295.52 → 1295.70] And I'll
[1295.70 → 1295.92] be like,
[1295.96 → 1296.18] oh no,
[1296.20 → 1296.68] you've got it
[1296.68 → 1297.00] already.
[1297.26 → 1297.92] And then it
[1297.92 → 1298.56] would change
[1298.56 → 1299.12] right as I
[1299.12 → 1299.74] hit like one
[1299.74 → 1300.22] more key.
[1300.62 → 1301.02] Ah,
[1301.02 → 1301.32] no,
[1301.40 → 1301.62] it's not
[1301.62 → 1301.80] what I
[1301.80 → 1302.00] meant to
[1302.00 → 1302.26] open.
[1303.84 → 1304.24] Apparently
[1304.24 → 1306.80] Stranger
[1306.80 → 1308.98] IT?
[1309.36 → 1310.04] I don't
[1310.04 → 1310.20] know.
[1310.60 → 1311.22] Their name
[1311.22 → 1311.60] is Float
[1311.60 → 1311.88] Goat in
[1311.88 → 1312.16] Battlefield.
[1312.38 → 1312.72] Let's go.
[1313.56 → 1314.20] My little
[1314.20 → 1314.72] note here
[1314.72 → 1316.20] is maybe
[1316.20 → 1316.60] Microsoft
[1316.60 → 1317.12] should pull
[1317.12 → 1317.62] an Edge.
[1318.66 → 1319.08] Other people
[1319.08 → 1319.38] are doing
[1319.38 → 1319.54] it.
[1319.60 → 1319.80] What if
[1319.80 → 1320.08] they just
[1320.08 → 1320.66] based their
[1320.66 → 1321.02] operating
[1321.02 → 1321.98] system off
[1321.98 → 1322.48] of Linux?
[1322.90 → 1323.46] With Edge,
[1323.54 → 1323.80] they just
[1323.80 → 1324.12] based it
[1324.12 → 1324.42] off of
[1324.42 → 1324.84] Chromium.
[1325.44 → 1325.96] What if
[1325.96 → 1326.24] they just
[1326.24 → 1326.74] gave up
[1326.74 → 1327.04] on the
[1327.04 → 1327.28] Windows
[1327.28 → 1327.58] kernel?
[1328.58 → 1329.04] What if
[1329.04 → 1329.32] they just
[1329.32 → 1329.68] let it
[1329.68 → 1330.06] die?
[1331.02 → 1332.24] Imagine
[1332.24 → 1332.60] how much
[1332.60 → 1332.84] better
[1332.84 → 1333.18] Windows
[1333.18 → 1333.46] server
[1333.46 → 1333.96] would be.
[1334.40 → 1334.96] That's
[1334.96 → 1335.22] kind of
[1335.22 → 1335.60] crazy.
[1335.82 → 1335.96] You're
[1335.96 → 1336.50] proposing
[1336.50 → 1337.16] that they
[1337.16 → 1337.58] turn
[1337.58 → 1338.12] Windows
[1338.12 → 1338.80] into a
[1338.80 → 1339.06] Linux
[1339.06 → 1339.58] distro.
[1340.00 → 1340.70] If the
[1340.70 → 1341.16] next
[1341.16 → 1341.98] iteration
[1341.98 → 1342.34] of
[1342.34 → 1342.70] Windows
[1342.70 → 1343.72] is just
[1343.72 → 1344.64] a
[1344.64 → 1345.06] distro
[1345.06 → 1345.60] of Linux.
[1345.60 → 1346.60] Windows
[1346.60 → 1347.74] is just
[1347.74 → 1348.74] going to
[1348.74 → 1348.82] do
[1348.82 → 1349.10] Windows
[1349.10 → 1350.04] is just
[1350.04 → 1350.66] going to
[1350.66 → 1350.94] do
[1350.94 → 1351.22] it.
[1353.96 → 1354.36] I
[1354.36 → 1354.50] think
[1354.50 → 1354.62] they
[1354.62 → 1354.76] should
[1354.76 → 1354.94] just
[1354.94 → 1355.08] do
[1355.08 → 1355.28] it.
[1359.90 → 1360.82] I
[1360.82 → 1361.36] told you
[1361.36 → 1361.68] Windows
[1361.68 → 1362.20] 12 would
[1362.20 → 1362.72] be great.
[1363.50 → 1363.92] I
[1363.92 → 1364.38] told you
[1364.38 → 1364.70] man.
[1364.74 → 1365.14] Dude.
[1366.36 → 1366.76] Windows
[1366.76 → 1367.02] aren't
[1367.02 → 1367.18] arched.
[1367.18 → 1367.34] Think
[1367.34 → 1367.76] about it.
[1368.14 → 1368.78] So much
[1368.78 → 1369.02] of the
[1369.02 → 1369.24] back
[1369.24 → 1369.66] catalogue
[1369.66 → 1370.08] is going
[1370.08 → 1370.32] to have
[1370.32 → 1370.72] to be
[1370.72 → 1372.10] equatable
[1372.10 → 1372.96] because of
[1372.96 → 1373.32] the switch
[1373.32 → 1373.88] to ARM
[1373.88 → 1374.54] anyway.
[1374.94 → 1375.76] Like looking
[1375.76 → 1376.12] at what a
[1376.12 → 1376.80] colossal
[1376.80 → 1377.40] project
[1377.40 → 1378.28] that has
[1378.28 → 1378.62] been
[1378.62 → 1379.74] would
[1379.74 → 1381.72] would
[1381.72 → 1382.56] figuring out
[1382.56 → 1383.24] a compatibility
[1383.24 → 1384.04] layer
[1384.04 → 1384.78] for your
[1384.78 → 1385.10] older
[1385.10 → 1385.54] Windows
[1385.54 → 1386.02] apps
[1386.02 → 1386.74] for new
[1386.74 → 1387.10] Linux
[1387.10 → 1387.58] Windows
[1387.58 → 1388.66] really be
[1388.66 → 1389.12] any harder
[1389.12 → 1389.62] than that.
[1391.02 → 1391.94] I literally
[1391.94 → 1392.56] don't know.
[1392.72 → 1393.46] I actually
[1393.46 → 1394.54] do not know
[1394.54 → 1395.02] the answer
[1395.02 → 1395.44] to that.
[1395.60 → 1395.72] It would
[1395.72 → 1396.12] be great.
[1396.20 → 1396.72] But given
[1396.72 → 1398.58] that Valve
[1398.58 → 1399.68] and the
[1399.68 → 1400.22] open source
[1400.22 → 1400.78] community
[1400.78 → 1402.38] managed to
[1402.38 → 1402.72] do it
[1402.72 → 1403.10] to a
[1403.10 → 1403.62] significant
[1403.62 → 1404.12] degree
[1404.12 → 1404.78] for gaming
[1404.78 → 1405.52] given that
[1405.52 → 1405.94] there are
[1405.94 → 1406.92] already
[1406.92 → 1408.14] there's
[1408.14 → 1408.58] already
[1408.58 → 1409.38] such
[1409.38 → 1410.46] widespread
[1410.46 → 1411.12] support
[1411.12 → 1411.60] for
[1411.60 → 1413.64] well
[1413.64 → 1414.32] okay
[1414.32 → 1414.84] no sorry
[1414.84 → 1415.18] I'm just
[1415.18 → 1415.56] I'm trying
[1415.56 → 1416.12] to I'm trying
[1416.12 → 1416.32] to wrap
[1416.32 → 1416.68] my brain
[1416.68 → 1417.14] around this
[1417.14 → 1417.40] because
[1417.40 → 1418.14] somehow
[1418.14 → 1418.96] in all
[1418.96 → 1419.30] the years
[1419.30 → 1419.74] of WAN
[1419.74 → 1420.04] show
[1420.04 → 1420.56] we have
[1420.56 → 1420.76] never
[1420.76 → 1421.06] talked
[1421.06 → 1421.30] about
[1421.30 → 1421.68] this
[1421.68 → 1426.12] could
[1426.12 → 1426.32] you
[1426.32 → 1426.60] could
[1426.60 → 1426.80] you
[1426.80 → 1427.18] use
[1427.18 → 1427.46] like
[1427.46 → 1428.06] Game Pass
[1428.06 → 1428.30] native
[1428.30 → 1428.64] on Linux
[1428.64 → 1429.00] yeah why
[1429.00 → 1429.22] not
[1429.22 → 1429.60] could you
[1429.60 → 1430.04] use like
[1430.04 → 1430.84] virtualization
[1430.84 → 1431.36] in some
[1431.36 → 1431.66] way
[1431.66 → 1431.96] like
[1431.96 → 1432.18] could
[1432.18 → 1432.56] you
[1432.56 → 1433.00] could
[1433.00 → 1433.14] you
[1433.14 → 1434.12] virtualize
[1434.12 → 1434.76] old
[1434.76 → 1435.86] windows
[1435.86 → 1436.40] to run
[1436.40 → 1436.74] certain
[1436.74 → 1437.04] apps
[1437.04 → 1437.24] like
[1437.24 → 1437.42] could
[1437.42 → 1437.74] you
[1437.74 → 1439.38] because
[1439.38 → 1440.10] there's the
[1440.10 → 1440.90] wine compatibility
[1440.90 → 1441.36] layer
[1441.36 → 1441.88] yeah
[1441.88 → 1442.42] people have
[1442.42 → 1442.74] called that
[1442.74 → 1443.06] out in full
[1443.06 → 1443.26] punch
[1443.26 → 1443.54] I was
[1443.54 → 1445.42] anyway
[1445.42 → 1449.34] there's some
[1449.34 → 1449.96] stuff to do
[1449.96 → 1450.54] this already
[1450.54 → 1451.42] like
[1451.42 → 1452.46] Valve
[1452.46 → 1452.90] yeah
[1452.90 → 1453.26] they could
[1453.26 → 1453.90] just pour
[1453.90 → 1454.40] into these
[1454.40 → 1454.80] open source
[1454.80 → 1455.32] projects
[1455.32 → 1456.04] and get
[1456.04 → 1456.38] it's done
[1456.38 → 1458.38] look at
[1458.38 → 1458.96] the rapid
[1458.96 → 1459.40] development
[1459.40 → 1459.96] that happened
[1459.96 → 1460.52] with Proton
[1460.52 → 1460.98] right but
[1460.98 → 1461.54] they want
[1461.54 → 1462.62] dude they
[1462.62 → 1463.58] but then
[1463.58 → 1465.16] why would
[1465.16 → 1465.98] OEMs like
[1465.98 → 1466.64] Lenovo
[1466.64 → 1467.50] and Acer
[1467.50 → 1469.26] keep pouring
[1469.26 → 1470.34] money into
[1470.34 → 1471.00] their coffers
[1471.00 → 1471.46] for Windows
[1471.46 → 1472.20] licenses then
[1472.20 → 1472.68] at that point
[1472.68 → 1473.22] because they
[1473.22 → 1474.02] do still
[1474.02 → 1474.50] make money
[1474.50 → 1474.96] on Windows
[1474.96 → 1475.62] as far as
[1475.62 → 1476.18] I can tell
[1476.18 → 1477.82] Microsoft
[1477.82 → 1478.68] Windows
[1478.68 → 1479.86] agreements
[1479.86 → 1480.66] to charge
[1480.66 → 1481.44] for a
[1481.44 → 1481.66] Linux
[1481.66 → 1482.04] distro
[1482.04 → 1483.88] no I
[1483.88 → 1484.20] don't think
[1484.20 → 1484.48] so
[1484.48 → 1485.02] well then
[1485.02 → 1485.30] they could
[1485.30 → 1485.58] just do
[1485.58 → 1485.84] that
[1485.84 → 1487.10] right but
[1487.10 → 1487.56] who would
[1487.56 → 1488.32] pay for
[1488.32 → 1488.68] it at
[1488.68 → 1488.80] that
[1488.80 → 1489.40] the familiarity
[1489.40 → 1489.92] would be
[1489.92 → 1490.22] there
[1490.22 → 1491.38] not with
[1491.38 → 1491.62] the way
[1491.62 → 1492.24] they keep
[1492.24 → 1493.36] changing the
[1493.36 → 1494.04] stupid UI
[1494.04 → 1494.60] all the time
[1494.60 → 1495.04] I mean why
[1495.04 → 1495.68] was my start
[1495.68 → 1496.24] menu in the
[1496.24 → 1496.70] middle all of
[1496.70 → 1497.04] a sudden
[1497.04 → 1497.70] yeah Red Hat
[1497.70 → 1498.50] is pretty
[1498.50 → 1498.98] sure I just
[1498.98 → 1499.30] didn't know
[1499.30 → 1499.62] if that was
[1499.62 → 1500.24] purely a
[1500.24 → 1500.98] support contract
[1500.98 → 1501.60] or if you
[1501.60 → 1501.96] actually had
[1501.96 → 1502.42] to pay for
[1502.42 → 1502.82] the distro
[1502.82 → 1503.22] itself
[1503.22 → 1504.06] I wasn't
[1504.06 → 1504.46] sure about
[1504.46 → 1504.98] that
[1504.98 → 1507.08] Windows
[1507.08 → 1507.60] revenue
[1507.60 → 1507.94] here we
[1507.94 → 1508.20] go
[1508.20 → 1510.06] fiscal year
[1510.06 → 1510.88] 2024
[1510.88 → 1512.04] compared to
[1512.04 → 1512.68] fiscal year
[1512.68 → 1513.54] 2023
[1513.54 → 1514.34] revenue
[1514.34 → 1515.02] increased
[1515.02 → 1516.22] 13%
[1516.22 → 1517.04] Windows
[1517.04 → 1517.54] revenue
[1517.54 → 1518.06] increased
[1518.06 → 1518.94] 8%
[1518.94 → 1519.48] driven by
[1519.48 → 1519.94] growth in
[1519.94 → 1520.32] Windows
[1520.32 → 1520.88] commercial
[1520.88 → 1521.86] and Windows
[1521.86 → 1522.50] OEM
[1522.50 → 1523.86] so note
[1523.86 → 1524.62] that retail
[1524.62 → 1525.58] is not
[1525.58 → 1526.38] their focus
[1526.38 → 1527.16] not even
[1527.16 → 1527.94] a little bit
[1527.94 → 1529.02] commercial
[1529.02 → 1529.54] products and
[1529.54 → 1530.20] cloud services
[1530.20 → 1530.54] revenue
[1530.54 → 1530.88] increased
[1530.88 → 1531.90] Microsoft
[1531.90 → 1532.84] 365
[1532.84 → 1533.40] Windows
[1533.40 → 1533.76] OEM
[1533.76 → 1535.68] so this
[1535.68 → 1536.44] is just
[1536.44 → 1537.10] like system
[1537.10 → 1537.76] builders
[1537.76 → 1538.68] Windows
[1538.68 → 1541.38] yeah so
[1541.38 → 1542.28] I can't think
[1542.28 → 1542.92] of a reason
[1542.92 → 1544.14] why if I'm
[1544.14 → 1544.94] Lenovo I
[1544.94 → 1545.52] want to keep
[1545.52 → 1546.36] paying even
[1546.36 → 1546.88] the bulk
[1546.88 → 1547.34] rate
[1547.34 → 1548.32] bulk rate
[1548.32 → 1548.68] Windows
[1548.68 → 1549.20] licenses
[1549.20 → 1550.50] if my
[1550.50 → 1551.22] user for
[1551.22 → 1551.80] this system
[1551.80 → 1552.18] is going
[1552.18 → 1552.56] to be able
[1552.56 → 1553.14] to just
[1553.14 → 1555.26] not run
[1555.26 → 1555.56] Windows
[1555.56 → 1556.42] and run
[1556.42 → 1556.70] all the
[1556.70 → 1557.02] same
[1557.02 → 1557.52] software
[1557.52 → 1558.02] but that's
[1558.02 → 1558.38] the thing
[1558.38 → 1558.76] run all
[1558.76 → 1559.16] the same
[1559.16 → 1559.68] software
[1559.68 → 1560.04] yeah
[1560.04 → 1562.02] stuff like
[1562.02 → 1562.52] Teams
[1562.52 → 1562.84] Microsoft
[1562.84 → 1563.18] Teams
[1563.18 → 1564.46] is rough
[1564.46 → 1565.94] every time
[1565.94 → 1566.26] I've had to
[1566.26 → 1566.50] use it
[1566.50 → 1567.10] it's rough
[1567.10 → 1568.86] to the point
[1568.86 → 1569.80] where it
[1569.80 → 1570.46] usually ends up
[1570.46 → 1571.02] being worth it
[1571.02 → 1571.56] to just run
[1571.56 → 1571.88] it in a
[1571.88 → 1572.18] browser
[1572.18 → 1572.84] which is
[1572.84 → 1573.20] a worse
[1573.20 → 1573.68] experience
[1573.68 → 1574.12] for an app
[1574.12 → 1574.50] like that
[1574.50 → 1574.78] in my
[1574.78 → 1575.06] opinion
[1575.06 → 1578.36] Ry saw says
[1578.36 → 1578.90] most users
[1578.90 → 1579.20] are just
[1579.20 → 1579.54] going to use
[1579.54 → 1579.92] whatever their
[1579.92 → 1580.52] computer ships
[1580.52 → 1580.74] with
[1580.74 → 1582.00] which is
[1582.00 → 1582.56] fair enough
[1582.56 → 1582.96] I just
[1582.96 → 1584.08] if I'm
[1584.08 → 1584.98] an Acer
[1584.98 → 1585.40] people have
[1585.40 → 1585.72] tried it
[1585.72 → 1585.94] though and
[1585.94 → 1586.20] those are
[1586.20 → 1586.82] less popular
[1586.82 → 1587.46] options even
[1587.46 → 1587.78] when they're
[1587.78 → 1588.02] cheaper
[1588.02 → 1589.32] but I might
[1589.32 → 1589.74] want to dip
[1589.74 → 1590.22] my toes
[1590.22 → 1590.68] into it
[1590.68 → 1591.14] if all of a
[1591.14 → 1591.52] sudden it
[1591.52 → 1591.90] wouldn't
[1591.90 → 1592.20] matter
[1592.20 → 1593.12] like if it
[1593.12 → 1593.72] legitimately
[1593.72 → 1594.12] wouldn't
[1594.12 → 1594.30] matter
[1594.30 → 1594.80] because the
[1594.80 → 1595.16] second
[1595.16 → 1595.70] Microsoft
[1595.70 → 1596.22] ships
[1596.22 → 1596.70] their
[1596.78 → 1598.50] Linda's
[1598.50 → 1599.20] fork or
[1599.20 → 1599.52] whatever
[1599.52 → 1600.62] I think
[1600.62 → 1601.08] that already
[1601.08 → 1601.42] exists
[1601.42 → 1601.74] I think
[1601.74 → 1602.08] it's just
[1602.08 → 1602.46] a Linux
[1602.46 → 1602.88] that is
[1602.88 → 1603.26] kind of
[1603.26 → 1603.58] skinned
[1603.58 → 1604.00] like Windows
[1604.00 → 1604.72] but the
[1604.72 → 1605.18] second they
[1605.18 → 1605.70] ship that
[1605.70 → 1606.58] you know
[1606.58 → 1607.04] that there's
[1607.04 → 1607.40] going to be
[1607.40 → 1608.12] forks upon
[1608.12 → 1608.82] forks upon
[1608.82 → 1609.42] forks upon
[1609.42 → 1609.96] forks of
[1609.96 → 1610.68] that
[1610.68 → 1611.28] try to
[1611.28 → 1612.26] replicate as
[1612.26 → 1612.76] much of
[1612.76 → 1613.90] the Linux
[1613.90 → 1614.28] Windows
[1614.28 → 1615.14] experience as
[1615.14 → 1615.56] possible
[1615.56 → 1616.86] and if
[1616.86 → 1618.10] what matters
[1618.10 → 1618.48] to the
[1618.48 → 1619.40] typical users
[1619.40 → 1620.00] that their
[1620.00 → 1621.32] browser works
[1621.32 → 1622.32] and the
[1622.32 → 1622.74] familiarity
[1622.74 → 1623.24] of the
[1623.24 → 1623.84] interface
[1623.84 → 1625.44] then I
[1625.44 → 1625.78] just don't
[1625.78 → 1626.14] think there's
[1626.14 → 1626.40] going to be
[1626.40 → 1627.00] much special
[1627.00 → 1627.96] sauce left for
[1627.96 → 1628.44] Windows at
[1628.44 → 1629.48] that point
[1629.48 → 1630.18] like the
[1630.18 → 1630.98] compatibility
[1630.98 → 1632.90] is pretty
[1632.90 → 1633.26] much the
[1633.26 → 1633.56] only thing
[1633.56 → 1634.14] keeping me
[1634.14 → 1634.42] on it
[1634.42 → 1634.66] now
[1634.66 → 1635.62] like just
[1635.62 → 1636.36] knowing that
[1636.36 → 1636.96] especially
[1636.96 → 1637.38] games
[1637.38 → 1638.04] it is purely
[1638.04 → 1638.44] the only
[1638.44 → 1638.84] thing keeping
[1638.84 → 1639.28] me on it
[1639.28 → 1639.88] anything I
[1639.88 → 1640.34] want to run
[1640.34 → 1640.94] is going
[1640.94 → 1641.34] to work
[1641.34 → 1641.60] on it
[1641.60 → 1642.18] so unless
[1642.18 → 1642.80] they put
[1642.80 → 1643.92] a ton
[1643.92 → 1644.36] of work
[1644.36 → 1644.76] into
[1644.76 → 1645.48] proprietary
[1645.48 → 1646.14] compatibility
[1646.14 → 1646.78] layers
[1646.78 → 1647.64] then I
[1647.64 → 1648.14] just don't
[1648.14 → 1648.54] really see
[1648.54 → 1649.24] what value
[1649.24 → 1649.68] their
[1649.68 → 1650.28] Windows
[1650.28 → 1650.86] Linux
[1650.86 → 1651.56] would have
[1651.56 → 1657.14] I think
[1657.14 → 1657.38] it would be
[1657.38 → 1657.66] funny
[1657.66 → 1659.28] yeah
[1659.28 → 1659.80] funny
[1659.80 → 1660.28] I wonder
[1660.28 → 1660.60] if
[1660.60 → 1661.12] there's
[1661.12 → 1661.50] billions
[1661.50 → 1662.00] of dollars
[1662.00 → 1662.28] on the
[1662.28 → 1662.44] line
[1662.44 → 1662.66] for them
[1662.66 → 1662.98] they can't
[1662.98 → 1663.26] just do
[1663.26 → 1663.46] things
[1663.46 → 1664.26] they can't
[1664.26 → 1664.54] just like
[1664.54 → 1665.28] post a
[1665.28 → 1665.86] new Windows
[1665.86 → 1666.86] computers are
[1666.86 → 1667.34] getting less
[1667.34 → 1667.78] and less
[1667.78 → 1668.42] central in
[1668.42 → 1668.72] people's
[1668.72 → 1669.16] lives
[1669.16 → 1672.16] Linux is
[1672.16 → 1673.12] getting easier
[1673.12 → 1673.54] and easier
[1673.54 → 1674.08] for people to
[1674.08 → 1674.92] use and the
[1674.92 → 1675.38] barriers are
[1675.38 → 1675.96] getting lower
[1675.96 → 1676.44] due to things
[1676.44 → 1677.12] like Proton
[1677.12 → 1680.18] 10 years
[1680.18 → 1680.80] 15 years
[1680.80 → 1682.02] if people just
[1682.02 → 1682.32] don't really
[1682.32 → 1682.92] care that much
[1682.92 → 1683.24] anymore
[1683.24 → 1685.48] they could
[1685.48 → 1685.74] try
[1685.74 → 1686.82] they'll still
[1686.82 → 1687.46] care about
[1687.46 → 1688.08] consider it
[1688.08 → 1688.72] long-term
[1688.72 → 1689.22] PMs at
[1689.22 → 1689.50] Microsoft
[1689.50 → 1690.54] consider it
[1690.54 → 1691.48] I would love
[1691.48 → 1692.04] it to happen
[1692.04 → 1693.72] I want
[1693.72 → 1694.28] Windows to
[1694.28 → 1694.70] die
[1694.70 → 1698.14] I wish I
[1698.14 → 1698.64] didn't think
[1698.64 → 1699.16] that I
[1699.16 → 1699.98] desperately wish
[1699.98 → 1700.24] I didn't
[1700.24 → 1700.60] think that
[1700.60 → 1701.12] if you asked
[1701.12 → 1701.46] me like
[1701.46 → 1703.84] seven years
[1703.84 → 1704.82] ago I'd
[1704.82 → 1705.30] just be happy
[1705.30 → 1705.82] using Windows
[1705.82 → 1706.26] for the entire
[1706.26 → 1706.60] rest of my
[1706.60 → 1707.00] life no
[1707.00 → 1707.94] problem I
[1707.94 → 1708.58] like it a
[1708.58 → 1709.28] lot the
[1709.28 → 1710.44] only trend
[1710.44 → 1710.84] line in
[1710.84 → 1711.36] Windows for
[1711.36 → 1712.18] a long
[1712.18 → 1713.22] long time
[1713.22 → 1713.68] has been
[1713.68 → 1718.14] I like
[1718.14 → 1719.36] hate it
[1719.36 → 1721.38] so unless
[1721.38 → 1721.80] there's a
[1721.80 → 1722.30] significant
[1722.30 → 1722.90] change
[1722.90 → 1724.00] 8.1 was
[1724.00 → 1724.40] okay
[1724.40 → 1724.98] 8.1 was
[1724.98 → 1725.26] all right
[1725.26 → 1726.24] yeah
[1726.24 → 1727.24] 8 was
[1727.24 → 1729.76] 8 was
[1729.76 → 1730.82] 8.1
[1730.82 → 1731.78] needed some
[1731.78 → 1732.56] work but you
[1732.56 → 1733.06] could get it
[1733.06 → 1733.84] to be pretty
[1733.84 → 1734.86] solid and then
[1734.86 → 1735.60] it would stay
[1735.60 → 1736.32] pretty solid
[1736.32 → 1736.72] oh yeah
[1736.72 → 1737.28] towards the
[1737.28 → 1738.18] end of 8.1
[1738.18 → 1738.66] when it was
[1738.66 → 1739.30] service packed
[1739.30 → 1740.18] up like it
[1740.18 → 1741.00] was it was
[1741.00 → 1741.66] pretty all right
[1741.66 → 1742.96] yeah and
[1742.96 → 1744.32] then right
[1744.32 → 1745.10] back at it
[1745.10 → 1746.62] Windows 10
[1746.62 → 1747.18] didn't like
[1747.18 → 1749.00] that never
[1749.00 → 1749.62] liked that
[1749.62 → 1750.12] Windows 11
[1750.12 → 1750.54] came out
[1750.54 → 1751.12] never liked
[1751.12 → 1751.56] that I
[1751.56 → 1751.96] can't remember
[1751.96 → 1752.26] what I
[1752.26 → 1752.52] thought of
[1752.52 → 1753.10] Windows 10
[1753.10 → 1754.84] I think
[1754.84 → 1755.28] Windows 10
[1755.28 → 1755.72] was okay
[1755.72 → 1756.60] I actually
[1756.60 → 1759.62] man it's
[1759.62 → 1760.50] kind of
[1760.50 → 1761.22] amazing how
[1761.22 → 1761.70] long ago
[1761.70 → 1762.22] Windows 10
[1762.22 → 1762.66] came out
[1762.66 → 1764.36] yeah so
[1764.36 → 1765.18] just for
[1765.18 → 1765.90] reference for
[1765.90 → 1767.04] people yeah
[1767.04 → 1767.66] Windows 10
[1767.66 → 1768.32] came out 10
[1768.32 → 1768.78] years ago
[1768.78 → 1769.28] like what
[1769.28 → 1769.88] so I
[1769.88 → 1770.98] have actively
[1770.98 → 1771.78] very much
[1771.78 → 1772.46] disliked
[1772.46 → 1773.20] everything about
[1773.20 → 1773.74] Windows for
[1773.74 → 1774.44] 10 years
[1774.44 → 1776.48] right so
[1776.48 → 1776.90] at a certain
[1776.90 → 1777.40] point it's
[1777.40 → 1778.36] just like damn
[1778.36 → 1780.72] dude can we
[1780.72 → 1781.48] make Luke
[1781.48 → 1782.00] switch to
[1782.00 → 1782.80] macOS
[1782.80 → 1783.90] no probably
[1783.90 → 1786.24] not I mean
[1786.24 → 1787.14] it really
[1787.14 → 1787.74] doesn't matter
[1787.74 → 1788.34] that much
[1788.34 → 1790.24] honestly and
[1790.24 → 1791.38] macOS gets
[1791.38 → 1792.72] ironically better
[1792.72 → 1793.52] support from
[1793.52 → 1794.28] when from
[1794.28 → 1795.14] Microsoft than
[1795.14 → 1796.02] Linux does in a
[1796.02 → 1796.50] lot of cases
[1796.50 → 1797.62] like no teams
[1797.62 → 1798.24] on macOS
[1798.24 → 1798.70] definitely
[1798.70 → 1799.54] yeah yeah
[1799.54 → 1799.88] that's not
[1799.88 → 1800.30] that's not even
[1800.30 → 1800.84] that's like all
[1800.84 → 1801.24] the time
[1801.24 → 1801.88] oh no, no I
[1801.88 → 1802.30] know I just
[1802.30 → 1803.42] mean the irony
[1803.42 → 1804.28] is just that
[1804.28 → 1804.74] you know
[1804.74 → 1807.28] Windows Mac
[1807.28 → 1809.50] but like
[1809.50 → 1810.28] it's mostly
[1810.28 → 1811.08] keep those Linux
[1811.08 → 1811.58] guys out
[1811.58 → 1812.72] yeah it's
[1812.72 → 1813.74] it's
[1813.74 → 1815.72] yeah and I
[1815.72 → 1816.36] don't think it
[1816.36 → 1817.02] like has to
[1817.02 → 1817.56] always be this
[1817.56 → 1817.84] way I
[1817.84 → 1818.32] absolutely
[1818.32 → 1819.24] definitely think
[1819.24 → 1819.62] there is a
[1819.62 → 1820.22] path to redemption
[1820.22 → 1820.88] for Windows I
[1820.88 → 1821.46] just don't think
[1821.46 → 1821.70] they're gonna
[1821.70 → 1822.10] take it
[1822.10 → 1823.10] that's why I'm
[1823.10 → 1823.84] like so
[1823.84 → 1824.44] frustrated and
[1824.44 → 1825.20] it's been so
[1825.20 → 1826.38] long of
[1826.38 → 1827.42] being very sure
[1827.42 → 1827.88] they're not
[1827.88 → 1828.50] going to take
[1828.50 → 1828.96] it that it's
[1828.96 → 1829.40] just like
[1829.40 → 1830.56] all right
[1830.56 → 1831.20] I don't know
[1831.20 → 1832.04] why it'd be
[1832.04 → 1832.86] it'd be interesting
[1832.86 → 1833.54] to sit in the
[1833.54 → 1835.16] boardroom and
[1835.16 → 1836.26] my sorry
[1836.26 → 1837.00] no go ahead
[1837.00 → 1838.26] my completely
[1838.26 → 1839.32] ignorant naive
[1839.32 → 1840.18] opinion
[1840.18 → 1841.16] yeah that it
[1841.16 → 1841.72] would be so
[1841.72 → 1842.42] easy to make
[1842.42 → 1843.26] it not trash
[1843.26 → 1844.92] I don't think
[1844.92 → 1845.32] it would take
[1845.32 → 1845.98] that much work
[1845.98 → 1846.60] to make it
[1846.60 → 1847.20] not trash
[1847.20 → 1847.92] genuinely
[1847.92 → 1849.18] because like
[1849.18 → 1850.34] there are a
[1850.34 → 1851.04] lot of things
[1851.04 → 1851.62] in my opinion
[1851.62 → 1852.08] that Windows
[1852.08 → 1852.82] could do
[1852.82 → 1853.26] that would
[1853.26 → 1853.68] make it
[1853.68 → 1854.28] cool and
[1854.28 → 1854.68] interesting
[1854.68 → 1855.26] and they
[1855.26 → 1855.64] don't
[1855.64 → 1856.34] that's a
[1856.34 → 1856.96] whole other
[1856.96 → 1857.50] question
[1857.50 → 1858.44] the thing
[1858.44 → 1859.02] that bothers
[1859.02 → 1859.48] me most
[1859.48 → 1859.90] is the
[1859.90 → 1860.40] things that
[1860.40 → 1861.12] they actively
[1861.12 → 1861.94] do that
[1861.94 → 1862.84] actively make
[1862.84 → 1863.38] it is bad
[1863.38 → 1864.06] or worse
[1864.06 → 1867.12] like if I
[1867.12 → 1867.58] if I have
[1867.58 → 1868.74] purchased my
[1868.74 → 1869.98] Windows I
[1869.98 → 1870.54] don't want
[1870.54 → 1871.78] freaking ads
[1871.78 → 1872.86] right
[1872.86 → 1873.58] ever
[1873.58 → 1874.88] any amount
[1874.88 → 1876.36] go away
[1876.36 → 1877.04] like just
[1877.04 → 1877.76] there's certain
[1877.76 → 1878.28] things that are
[1878.28 → 1878.90] like my goodness
[1878.90 → 1880.94] and we know
[1880.94 → 1881.60] that they've been
[1881.60 → 1882.54] rather okay with
[1882.54 → 1883.52] Windows piracy for
[1883.52 → 1884.54] like a long time
[1884.54 → 1885.18] so if you're
[1885.18 → 1885.44] going to do
[1885.44 → 1886.14] that just put
[1886.14 → 1886.70] ads in those
[1886.70 → 1887.10] versions
[1887.10 → 1888.10] whatever
[1888.10 → 1889.42] but if I
[1889.42 → 1890.58] bought it
[1890.58 → 1892.36] go away
[1892.36 → 1893.20] like it's
[1893.20 → 1894.02] you just
[1894.02 → 1894.48] mentioned it
[1894.48 → 1895.16] barely matters
[1895.16 → 1895.46] anymore
[1895.46 → 1896.36] I agree
[1896.36 → 1897.36] so get out
[1897.36 → 1897.92] of my way
[1897.92 → 1899.28] don't just
[1899.28 → 1899.84] like put all
[1899.84 → 1900.36] this junk
[1900.36 → 1900.74] there all the
[1900.74 → 1900.88] time
[1900.88 → 1901.38] don't make
[1901.38 → 1902.24] search bad
[1902.24 → 1903.12] or make it
[1903.12 → 1904.00] an easy toggle
[1904.00 → 1904.90] and never turn
[1904.90 → 1905.40] it back on
[1905.40 → 1905.90] if I turn it
[1905.90 → 1906.16] off
[1906.16 → 1908.42] no questions
[1908.42 → 1909.78] if I'm like
[1909.78 → 1910.30] you know what
[1910.30 → 1911.06] I kind of like
[1911.06 → 1911.84] just using my
[1911.84 → 1912.68] start for
[1912.68 → 1913.86] search and for
[1913.86 → 1914.40] local files
[1914.40 → 1916.12] but if you
[1916.12 → 1916.80] did sure
[1916.80 → 1918.00] then you can
[1918.00 → 1918.40] leave that on
[1918.40 → 1918.86] that's no problem
[1918.86 → 1919.28] but just let me
[1919.28 → 1919.76] turn it off
[1919.76 → 1920.14] and don't
[1920.14 → 1921.18] bury it in a
[1921.18 → 1921.52] reg edit
[1921.52 → 1922.52] and don't
[1922.52 → 1923.14] reset it
[1923.14 → 1923.70] every once in a
[1923.70 → 1923.90] while
[1923.90 → 1925.08] remember when
[1925.08 → 1926.46] like media
[1926.46 → 1926.96] player was
[1926.96 → 1927.48] pretty cool
[1927.48 → 1928.08] media player
[1928.08 → 1928.68] used to be
[1928.68 → 1929.16] sick
[1929.16 → 1930.90] the new one
[1930.90 → 1931.86] is so annoying
[1931.86 → 1932.62] do you remember
[1932.62 → 1933.82] when the ability
[1933.82 → 1934.78] to view photos
[1934.78 → 1935.86] within Windows
[1935.86 → 1936.34] was not
[1936.34 → 1936.44] horrible
[1936.44 → 1936.80] wasn't just
[1936.80 → 1937.58] a trash
[1937.58 → 1938.22] experience
[1938.22 → 1939.42] they have this
[1939.42 → 1939.66] new
[1939.66 → 1940.14] what is it
[1940.14 → 1940.30] called
[1940.30 → 1941.24] why is this
[1941.24 → 1941.62] pop up
[1941.62 → 1942.20] coming up
[1942.20 → 1943.66] go away
[1943.66 → 1944.20] where's the
[1944.20 → 1944.64] X
[1944.64 → 1946.42] where's the
[1946.42 → 1946.64] X
[1946.64 → 1947.44] this sucks
[1947.44 → 1948.56] so much
[1948.56 → 1949.44] this is such
[1949.44 → 1950.06] a terrible
[1950.06 → 1950.76] experience
[1950.76 → 1951.50] any window
[1951.50 → 1952.32] that doesn't
[1952.32 → 1952.98] have an X
[1952.98 → 1953.50] in the top
[1953.50 → 1953.80] right
[1953.80 → 1954.50] should be
[1954.50 → 1955.52] banned
[1955.52 → 1956.20] yeah
[1956.20 → 1956.86] by law
[1956.86 → 1957.68] yeah
[1957.68 → 1958.34] I don't want
[1958.34 → 1958.60] next
[1958.60 → 1959.12] I don't want
[1959.12 → 1959.40] anything
[1959.40 → 1960.04] I want this
[1960.04 → 1960.42] to get out
[1960.42 → 1960.78] of my way
[1960.78 → 1961.20] because I'm
[1961.20 → 1961.64] using my
[1961.64 → 1962.04] computer
[1962.04 → 1964.68] I hate
[1964.68 → 1964.96] the new
[1964.96 → 1965.46] photos app
[1965.46 → 1965.86] I hate
[1965.86 → 1966.38] the new
[1966.38 → 1967.56] video playing
[1967.56 → 1967.96] app
[1967.96 → 1968.54] I actually
[1968.54 → 1969.14] did kind
[1969.14 → 1969.54] of like
[1969.54 → 1969.94] old
[1969.94 → 1970.54] like Windows
[1970.54 → 1970.94] Media Player
[1970.94 → 1971.34] Classic
[1971.34 → 1972.20] I know
[1972.20 → 1972.46] it was
[1972.46 → 1972.64] like
[1972.64 → 1972.84] more
[1972.84 → 1973.20] based
[1973.20 → 1973.58] to use
[1973.58 → 1973.94] VLC
[1973.94 → 1974.40] or whatever
[1974.40 → 1974.64] else
[1974.64 → 1975.08] but I liked
[1975.08 → 1975.72] Windows Media Player
[1975.72 → 1976.22] Classic
[1976.22 → 1978.64] why did this
[1978.64 → 1979.46] open in a new
[1979.46 → 1979.88] thing
[1979.88 → 1983.80] yeah
[1983.80 → 1984.62] it's whack

[1987.26 → 1987.98] easy to just
[1987.98 → 1988.72] quickly crop
[1988.72 → 1989.38] something now
[1989.38 → 1990.18] because that
[1990.18 → 1990.70] used to drive
[1990.70 → 1991.36] me absolutely
[1991.36 → 1991.88] crazy
[1991.88 → 1993.08] is that

[2002.64 → 2003.02] to crop
[2003.02 → 2003.46] things in
[2003.46 → 2003.90] here now
[2003.90 → 2005.72] uh
[2005.72 → 2007.82] how do I
[2007.82 → 2008.54] apply it
[2008.54 → 2010.00] why is this
[2010.00 → 2010.46] what is all
[2010.46 → 2010.96] this AI
[2010.96 → 2011.44] crap
[2011.44 → 2013.36] uh
[2013.36 → 2013.70] okay
[2013.70 → 2014.84] save
[2014.84 → 2016.80] so wait

[2017.16 → 2018.44] okay is
[2018.44 → 2018.72] it
[2018.72 → 2020.76] okay I
[2020.76 → 2021.20] can't just
[2021.20 → 2021.90] I can't just
[2021.90 → 2022.46] apply it
[2022.46 → 2023.50] dude I
[2023.50 → 2023.90] don't know
[2023.90 → 2024.52] maybe I'm
[2024.52 → 2025.04] missing something
[2025.04 → 2025.54] here but
[2025.54 → 2025.82] like
[2025.82 → 2026.46] this part
[2026.46 → 2027.26] whatever
[2027.26 → 2027.68] that's just
[2027.68 → 2028.10] getting used
[2028.10 → 2028.54] to how this
[2028.54 → 2029.02] app works
[2029.02 → 2029.40] I hope
[2029.40 → 2029.74] you think
[2029.74 → 2030.00] so
[2030.00 → 2030.46] I hope
[2030.46 → 2030.78] I don't
[2030.78 → 2030.98] know
[2030.98 → 2033.42] I don't
[2033.42 → 2033.78] know man
[2033.78 → 2034.18] when I
[2034.18 → 2034.96] I don't
[2034.96 → 2035.42] know why
[2035.42 → 2036.34] apply buttons
[2036.34 → 2036.86] went out of
[2036.86 → 2037.20] fashion
[2037.20 → 2039.86] I suspect if you
[2039.86 → 2040.40] just saved it
[2040.40 → 2040.86] it would just be
[2040.86 → 2041.08] that
[2041.08 → 2042.00] yeah it will
[2042.00 → 2042.86] no, no oh no, no
[2042.86 → 2043.24] I don't I
[2043.24 → 2043.86] don't doubt that
[2043.86 → 2044.64] I don't doubt that
[2044.64 → 2046.02] I just I don't
[2046.02 → 2046.72] know man I just
[2046.72 → 2047.36] I like
[2047.36 → 2048.96] sure I like being
[2048.96 → 2049.96] able to apply a
[2049.96 → 2050.28] change
[2050.28 → 2050.84] I just know it's
[2050.84 → 2051.40] done and then
[2051.40 → 2052.38] seeing that it is
[2052.38 → 2053.46] done it just
[2053.46 → 2054.22] doesn't seem
[2054.22 → 2055.96] this is better
[2055.96 → 2056.70] than it was for a
[2056.70 → 2057.64] long time man the
[2057.64 → 2058.80] the stupid clip champ
[2058.80 → 2059.36] on your computer
[2059.36 → 2060.82] I do have clip champ
[2060.82 → 2061.56] I mean it comes
[2061.56 → 2062.24] installed on my
[2062.24 → 2062.64] computer
[2062.64 → 2063.44] pisses me
[2063.44 → 2067.48] what it is it
[2067.48 → 2068.10] worse than Windows
[2068.10 → 2069.44] Movie Maker I mean
[2069.44 → 2070.16] Windows Movie Maker
[2070.16 → 2071.02] was kind of a piece of
[2071.02 → 2071.64] junk moviemaker
[2071.64 → 2072.28] better apparently
[2072.28 → 2072.90] mine doesn't even
[2072.90 → 2073.50] have clipped
[2073.50 → 2074.36] oh I have clipped
[2074.36 → 2075.00] champ I can open
[2075.00 → 2075.36] up clip
[2075.36 → 2076.74] champ I probably
[2076.74 → 2077.84] uninstalled it
[2077.84 → 2078.94] I may have done a
[2078.94 → 2080.10] pass and like
[2080.10 → 2081.18] sure I always do
[2081.18 → 2082.40] a sanitization
[2082.40 → 2082.42] why do I have to
[2082.42 → 2082.88] sign in
[2082.88 → 2083.98] done immediately
[2083.98 → 2084.98] pissed
[2084.98 → 2087.64] this is my point
[2087.64 → 2088.60] what are you
[2088.60 → 2089.54] talking about
[2089.54 → 2092.84] I want to edit
[2092.84 → 2093.56] a video
[2093.56 → 2094.92] I don't need to
[2094.92 → 2095.60] log into your
[2095.60 → 2096.62] stupid thing
[2096.62 → 2097.86] I need a timeline
[2097.86 → 2098.82] I need to put the
[2098.82 → 2099.56] video on it
[2099.56 → 2100.96] maybe the video
[2100.96 → 2101.62] has some audio
[2101.62 → 2102.26] great there should
[2102.26 → 2102.92] be a timeline for
[2102.92 → 2103.78] the audio if not
[2103.78 → 2104.46] I can put my own
[2104.46 → 2104.96] audio there
[2104.96 → 2107.80] you had Windows
[2107.80 → 2108.32] Movie Maker
[2108.32 → 2109.52] tons of people
[2109.52 → 2110.64] actually cut their
[2110.64 → 2111.56] teeth on editing
[2111.56 → 2112.52] videos with Windows
[2112.52 → 2112.98] Movie Maker
[2112.98 → 2113.98] it was kind of
[2113.98 → 2114.72] rough but they
[2114.72 → 2115.10] could have just
[2115.10 → 2115.64] made the experience
[2115.64 → 2116.30] better over time
[2116.30 → 2116.78] hold on Luke
[2116.78 → 2117.68] are you wanting to
[2117.68 → 2118.38] sign in with Google
[2118.38 → 2118.88] or email
[2118.88 → 2124.12] would that make it
[2124.12 → 2124.40] better
[2124.40 → 2125.98] just stop
[2125.98 → 2128.10] like oh my god
[2128.10 → 2130.54] their differentiating
[2130.54 → 2131.88] factor for Microsoft
[2131.88 → 2133.02] seems to be right now
[2133.02 → 2133.86] that they're pushing
[2133.86 → 2134.78] the apps like
[2134.78 → 2137.20] the negative thing
[2137.20 → 2137.94] they're doing towards
[2137.94 → 2138.26] Linux
[2138.26 → 2139.00] is that there's no
[2139.00 → 2139.96] like native
[2139.96 → 2141.72] from vendor
[2141.72 → 2142.72] Teams app
[2142.72 → 2143.76] I don't think you
[2143.76 → 2144.68] can do Office 365
[2144.68 → 2145.72] natively on Linux
[2145.72 → 2146.40] I'm not sure
[2146.40 → 2147.24] I just don't think
[2147.24 → 2147.48] so
[2147.48 → 2148.74] or at least not
[2148.74 → 2149.24] easily
[2149.24 → 2151.96] okay
[2151.96 → 2152.98] so make your
[2152.98 → 2153.58] video editor
[2153.58 → 2153.94] like
[2153.94 → 2155.26] at least
[2155.26 → 2156.60] fine
[2156.60 → 2157.56] they've retired
[2157.56 → 2158.34] the official native
[2158.34 → 2159.14] Teams app for Linux
[2159.14 → 2159.98] in late 2022
[2159.98 → 2161.34] according to
[2161.34 → 2162.28] AI overview
[2162.28 → 2162.90] yeah so you have to
[2162.90 → 2163.60] use this like
[2163.60 → 2164.14] other one
[2164.14 → 2164.78] and it has a bunch
[2164.78 → 2165.24] of issues
[2165.24 → 2167.16] and it is what it is
[2167.16 → 2167.82] I appreciate
[2167.82 → 2168.26] that somebody
[2168.26 → 2169.28] made one
[2169.28 → 2169.66] at all
[2169.66 → 2170.18] but like
[2170.18 → 2170.60] it's far
[2170.60 → 2171.10] from perfect
[2171.10 → 2172.26] yeah okay
[2172.26 → 2173.00] this is
[2173.00 → 2174.12] also on
[2174.12 → 2176.02] Q&A on
[2176.02 → 2176.82] Microsoft
[2176.82 → 2177.44] it might be
[2177.44 → 2177.98] far from perfect
[2177.98 → 2178.38] because they
[2178.38 → 2178.86] haven't really
[2178.86 → 2179.26] had that much
[2179.26 → 2179.62] time
[2179.62 → 2180.32] because that
[2180.32 → 2180.72] happened not
[2180.72 → 2181.02] that long
[2181.02 → 2181.22] ago
[2181.22 → 2181.74] but it's
[2181.74 → 2182.16] just like
[2182.16 → 2182.56] there's all
[2182.56 → 2183.08] these things
[2183.08 → 2183.52] where like
[2183.52 → 2184.34] if the
[2184.34 → 2185.00] if the
[2185.00 → 2186.52] I never hear
[2186.52 → 2187.14] those types
[2187.14 → 2187.72] of complaints
[2187.72 → 2188.32] from Apple
[2188.32 → 2188.66] people
[2188.66 → 2189.66] I hear other
[2189.66 → 2190.10] complaints
[2190.10 → 2190.76] but I don't
[2190.76 → 2191.20] hear those
[2191.20 → 2191.58] types of
[2191.58 → 2191.90] complaints
[2191.90 → 2193.04] Windows is so
[2193.04 → 2193.58] obsessed
[2193.58 → 2194.96] with constantly
[2194.96 → 2195.80] stopping you
[2195.80 → 2196.14] from doing
[2196.14 → 2196.42] the thing
[2196.42 → 2196.62] that you
[2196.62 → 2197.12] want to do
[2197.12 → 2198.34] Pugboy1321
[2198.34 → 2199.02] says I miss
[2199.02 → 2199.54] when Windows
[2199.54 → 2200.14] let us set
[2200.14 → 2201.04] another media
[2201.04 → 2201.60] player as the
[2201.60 → 2202.16] default for
[2202.16 → 2203.02] every format
[2203.02 → 2204.42] now I have to
[2204.42 → 2204.80] do it per
[2204.80 → 2205.32] file type
[2205.32 → 2206.04] yeah the change
[2206.04 → 2206.54] in the defaults
[2206.54 → 2207.30] is so annoying
[2207.30 → 2207.68] now
[2207.68 → 2208.76] like it's just
[2208.76 → 2209.24] another like
[2209.24 → 2210.16] why
[2210.16 → 2210.68] and the
[2210.68 → 2211.20] oh man
[2211.20 → 2211.68] the one that
[2211.68 → 2212.38] really kills
[2212.38 → 2213.56] me is that
[2213.56 → 2214.40] wizard that
[2214.40 → 2215.04] comes up
[2215.04 → 2215.88] like every
[2215.88 → 2216.38] I don't know
[2216.38 → 2216.94] every three
[2216.94 → 2217.24] months
[2217.24 → 2217.76] every six
[2217.76 → 2218.08] months
[2218.08 → 2218.40] you know
[2218.40 → 2218.74] the one I'm
[2218.74 → 2219.22] talking about
[2219.22 → 2219.52] where it
[2219.52 → 2219.82] looks like
[2219.82 → 2220.52] it formatted
[2220.52 → 2220.96] your computer
[2220.96 → 2221.52] it makes you
[2221.52 → 2221.86] go through
[2221.86 → 2222.32] the FBI
[2222.32 → 2222.74] again
[2222.74 → 2223.04] yeah
[2223.04 → 2224.46] and like
[2224.46 → 2225.32] dark patterns
[2225.32 → 2226.12] the crap out
[2226.12 → 2226.38] of you
[2226.38 → 2226.92] trying to
[2226.92 → 2227.22] get you
[2227.22 → 2227.82] to change
[2227.82 → 2228.64] to edge
[2228.64 → 2229.36] intensely
[2229.36 → 2230.46] Luke yours
[2230.46 → 2231.10] did that
[2231.10 → 2231.74] when I turned
[2231.74 → 2232.08] it on this
[2232.08 → 2232.28] morning
[2232.28 → 2233.16] not surprised
[2233.16 → 2233.84] happens every
[2233.84 → 2234.16] once in a
[2234.16 → 2234.44] while
[2234.44 → 2235.62] never do
[2235.62 → 2235.96] that
[2235.96 → 2236.50] yeah
[2236.50 → 2236.74] it's like
[2236.74 → 2237.10] there's so
[2237.10 → 2237.50] many things
[2237.50 → 2237.90] that it's like
[2237.90 → 2238.54] never under
[2238.54 → 2239.24] any circumstance
[2239.24 → 2239.88] do that
[2239.88 → 2240.60] and then it's
[2240.60 → 2241.70] just everything
[2241.70 → 2242.34] on Windows
[2242.34 → 2243.14] it's like
[2243.14 → 2243.74] whoa
[2243.74 → 2244.48] but then
[2244.48 → 2245.60] stopping doing
[2245.60 → 2246.70] that doesn't
[2246.70 → 2247.68] seem that hard
[2247.68 → 2248.54] which I'm like
[2248.54 → 2249.02] I don't know
[2249.02 → 2249.62] maybe if like
[2249.62 → 2250.26] the right person
[2250.26 → 2250.82] gets in the right
[2250.82 → 2251.18] position
[2251.18 → 2252.20] they can fix it
[2252.20 → 2253.08] it is definitely
[2253.08 → 2254.14] not unfixable
[2254.14 → 2256.20] I just don't
[2256.20 → 2256.94] believe it's gonna
[2256.94 → 2257.64] happen anymore
[2257.64 → 2260.20] because it's been
[2260.20 → 2262.30] so long
[2262.30 → 2263.48] of just constantly
[2263.48 → 2264.14] trending in this
[2264.14 → 2264.56] direction
[2264.56 → 2265.48] Doc says
[2265.48 → 2266.14] you can turn
[2266.14 → 2266.72] that off
[2266.72 → 2268.06] and that's cool
[2268.06 → 2268.98] I actually didn't
[2268.98 → 2269.46] know that
[2269.46 → 2270.64] because from my
[2270.64 → 2271.28] understanding it
[2271.28 → 2271.88] happens when you
[2271.88 → 2272.76] apply major update
[2272.76 → 2273.66] so I just assumed
[2273.66 → 2274.08] that it was
[2274.08 → 2275.10] re-enabling itself
[2275.10 → 2276.36] so I didn't know
[2276.36 → 2276.88] that that's good
[2276.88 → 2277.26] to know
[2277.26 → 2278.04] but also
[2278.04 → 2279.06] I shouldn't
[2279.06 → 2279.42] have to
[2279.42 → 2281.12] that should
[2281.12 → 2281.58] just
[2281.58 → 2283.50] not happen
[2283.50 → 2285.66] even once
[2285.66 → 2287.22] or
[2287.22 → 2288.16] or if they
[2288.16 → 2289.16] must do it
[2289.16 → 2290.86] a confirmation
[2290.86 → 2291.58] screen
[2291.58 → 2293.08] here's the way
[2293.08 → 2293.98] everything was set
[2293.98 → 2294.30] up
[2294.30 → 2295.28] because I mean
[2295.28 → 2295.72] nowadays
[2295.72 → 2296.38] they're still good
[2296.38 → 2296.70] with this
[2296.70 → 2298.04] they still roll
[2298.04 → 2298.20] out
[2298.20 → 2299.08] they roll out
[2299.08 → 2299.82] things that would
[2299.82 → 2300.16] have been a
[2300.16 → 2300.80] surface pack
[2300.80 → 2301.38] or a surface
[2301.38 → 2301.68] pack
[2301.68 → 2302.54] a service pack
[2302.54 → 2303.50] or that would
[2303.50 → 2303.96] have been
[2303.96 → 2304.44] like a
[2304.44 → 2306.02] major update
[2306.02 → 2306.64] as just part
[2306.64 → 2307.06] of like
[2307.06 → 2307.28] you know
[2307.28 → 2307.88] last windows
[2307.88 → 2308.34] you'll ever
[2308.34 → 2309.00] need whatever
[2309.00 → 2309.94] like they really
[2309.94 → 2310.46] do
[2310.46 → 2311.56] major updates
[2311.56 → 2311.98] that would have
[2311.98 → 2312.58] previously been
[2312.58 → 2313.18] another version
[2313.18 → 2313.64] of windows
[2313.64 → 2314.00] or there would
[2314.00 → 2314.16] have been
[2314.16 → 2314.74] a service pack
[2314.74 → 2315.18] or something
[2315.18 → 2315.52] sure
[2315.52 → 2317.02] so I could
[2317.02 → 2317.38] see
[2317.38 → 2318.26] another version
[2318.26 → 2318.54] of windows
[2318.54 → 2318.98] but definitely
[2318.98 → 2319.50] service pack
[2319.50 → 2320.60] every once in a while
[2320.60 → 2321.40] if they were to do
[2321.40 → 2322.10] something like that
[2322.10 → 2322.84] I mean Windows 10
[2322.84 → 2324.40] changed a frigging lot
[2324.40 → 2325.90] from day one
[2325.90 → 2327.60] to sunset
[2327.60 → 2329.02] like a lot
[2329.02 → 2330.42] under the hood
[2330.42 → 2332.52] I don't know
[2332.52 → 2333.38] I leave that
[2333.38 → 2333.88] to you guys
[2333.88 → 2335.12] but the fact that
[2335.12 → 2335.48] it was mostly
[2335.48 → 2335.82] under the hood
[2335.82 → 2336.80] is why I don't
[2336.80 → 2337.62] see another version
[2337.62 → 2337.86] of windows
[2337.86 → 2338.00] sure
[2338.00 → 2338.70] you know what
[2338.70 → 2339.16] that's fair
[2339.16 → 2340.04] but I also
[2340.04 → 2340.56] think you're right
[2340.56 → 2341.40] but either way
[2341.40 → 2342.48] if every once
[2342.48 → 2342.86] in a while
[2342.86 → 2343.80] they did a major
[2343.80 → 2344.16] one
[2344.16 → 2344.62] and they were
[2344.62 → 2344.98] like yeah
[2344.98 → 2345.76] this is basically
[2345.76 → 2346.62] like you know
[2346.62 → 2347.72] being on a new
[2347.72 → 2348.12] windows
[2348.12 → 2348.72] and they were
[2348.72 → 2349.06] like hey
[2349.06 → 2349.74] here's how you
[2349.74 → 2350.10] had everything
[2350.10 → 2350.68] set up before
[2350.68 → 2351.04] you're still
[2351.04 → 2351.70] good with this
[2351.70 → 2352.70] if I had to
[2352.70 → 2353.88] click one
[2353.88 → 2354.28] button
[2354.28 → 2357.46] okay
[2357.46 → 2358.10] it's also
[2358.10 → 2359.12] genuinely like
[2359.12 → 2360.54] confusing for a
[2360.54 → 2360.94] lot of people
[2360.94 → 2361.42] and they think
[2361.42 → 2361.90] their computer
[2361.90 → 2362.70] just like reset
[2362.70 → 2363.30] oh dude
[2363.30 → 2364.44] my kids
[2364.44 → 2364.98] accidentally
[2364.98 → 2366.62] updated our media
[2366.62 → 2367.34] PC to windows
[2367.34 → 2368.24] 11 because of
[2368.24 → 2368.66] one of those
[2368.66 → 2368.98] prompts
[2368.98 → 2369.56] exactly
[2369.56 → 2370.86] it's weird
[2370.86 → 2371.80] it's very
[2371.80 → 2372.32] unnatural
[2372.32 → 2373.48] it feels like
[2373.48 → 2374.26] something is wrong
[2374.26 → 2374.96] with your computer
[2374.96 → 2375.86] like
[2375.86 → 2378.08] it was a different
[2378.08 → 2378.28] one
[2378.28 → 2379.32] it was the upgrade
[2379.32 → 2379.98] to Windows 11
[2379.98 → 2380.38] prompt
[2380.38 → 2381.28] but I think you get
[2381.28 → 2381.70] what I mean
[2381.70 → 2382.28] just like these
[2382.28 → 2382.86] full screen
[2382.86 → 2383.90] take over your
[2383.90 → 2384.70] whole computer
[2384.70 → 2385.98] dark patterned
[2385.98 → 2386.62] like crazy
[2386.62 → 2387.66] definitely click
[2387.66 → 2388.40] the blue button
[2388.40 → 2389.28] like I came
[2389.28 → 2389.72] and I was like
[2389.72 → 2390.56] oh my god
[2390.56 → 2391.22] we have no Wi-Fi
[2391.22 → 2391.76] drivers
[2391.76 → 2392.86] why do we have
[2392.86 → 2393.30] no Wi-Fi
[2393.30 → 2393.94] why are we
[2393.94 → 2394.44] running windows
[2394.44 → 2394.78] 11
[2394.78 → 2395.58] everything on
[2395.58 → 2396.02] this machine
[2396.02 → 2396.46] was working
[2396.46 → 2397.02] perfectly
[2397.02 → 2398.26] have a window
[2398.26 → 2398.88] pop up
[2398.88 → 2399.60] make it full
[2399.60 → 2400.16] screen if you
[2400.16 → 2400.80] want but leave
[2400.80 → 2401.40] your start menu
[2401.40 → 2402.00] so you can tell
[2402.00 → 2402.66] that the computer
[2402.66 → 2403.54] booted properly
[2403.54 → 2405.04] have like
[2405.04 → 2406.60] those whatever
[2406.60 → 2407.24] they're called
[2407.24 → 2408.18] there are emojis for
[2408.18 → 2408.82] them where like
[2408.82 → 2409.62] the streamers pop
[2409.62 → 2410.04] out the party
[2410.04 → 2410.64] streamers pop out
[2410.64 → 2411.02] and there's like
[2411.02 → 2411.86] a canon thing
[2411.86 → 2412.60] whatever have
[2412.60 → 2413.06] those in the
[2413.06 → 2413.54] corner have
[2413.54 → 2414.04] them like actually
[2414.04 → 2414.52] go off and
[2414.52 → 2415.00] animate like
[2415.00 → 2415.86] you got a big
[2415.86 → 2416.56] upgrade to
[2416.56 → 2417.24] Windows 11
[2417.24 → 2417.62] hooray
[2417.62 → 2418.06] there's here's
[2418.06 → 2418.38] some cool
[2418.38 → 2419.20] things do you
[2419.20 → 2419.58] still want your
[2419.58 → 2420.12] settings to be the
[2420.12 → 2420.76] same this is what
[2420.76 → 2422.12] they were like
[2422.12 → 2422.74] now I'm like
[2422.74 → 2423.58] oh sick
[2423.58 → 2424.48] this thing that
[2424.48 → 2424.94] I bought just
[2424.94 → 2425.52] got better
[2425.52 → 2426.64] instead of
[2426.64 → 2427.82] incredibly annoyed
[2427.82 → 2429.56] like it's this
[2429.56 → 2430.06] is what I mean
[2430.06 → 2431.02] the gap is not
[2431.02 → 2432.26] that hard to
[2432.26 → 2433.38] jump but i
[2433.38 → 2434.42] don't trust
[2434.42 → 2435.04] they'll do it
[2435.04 → 2435.76] because they
[2435.76 → 2436.40] haven't done it
[2436.40 → 2436.96] in a decade
[2436.96 → 2438.36] right which is
[2438.36 → 2439.10] too long
[2439.10 → 2441.46] so i I don't
[2441.46 → 2442.22] know i
[2442.22 → 2442.98] you heard it
[2442.98 → 2443.54] here first we
[2443.54 → 2444.18] finally found
[2444.18 → 2444.58] what's too
[2444.58 → 2445.24] long for Luke
[2445.24 → 2450.76] i just i never
[2450.76 → 2451.20] thought it was
[2451.20 → 2451.72] going to happen
[2451.72 → 2453.96] but it finally
[2453.96 → 2454.98] came if they
[2454.98 → 2455.44] give me a little
[2455.44 → 2456.08] bit of hope i
[2456.08 → 2456.78] can keep
[2456.78 → 2458.82] if they give me a
[2458.82 → 2459.28] little hope I can
[2459.28 → 2459.68] keep going
[2459.68 → 2460.94] they just gotta
[2460.94 → 2462.34] tease it a little
[2462.34 → 2462.54] bit
[2462.54 → 2463.54] yeah oh god
[2463.54 → 2464.96] uh anyway
[2464.96 → 2470.64] I just hear

[2476.98 → 2477.90] guide us back
[2477.90 → 2478.28] to the past
[2478.28 → 2479.04] yeah so either
[2479.04 → 2479.66] either they
[2479.66 → 2480.12] figure it out
[2480.12 → 2480.46] which I don't
[2480.46 → 2480.94] think they will
[2480.94 → 2481.56] or I hope it
[2481.56 → 2483.28] dies and uh
[2483.28 → 2484.00] Linux gets easier
[2484.00 → 2484.60] to use for more
[2484.60 → 2485.36] people the
[2485.36 → 2485.98] community grows

[2725.68 → 2727.10] it's got like uh it's got like
[2727.10 → 2728.70] a brushed that is handmade isn't
[2728.70 → 2730.68] it plastic front uh
[2730.68 → 2732.60] unfortunately it's been through
[2732.60 → 2734.96] some hard times so this little
[2734.96 → 2737.22] spot on the front is dented
[2737.22 → 2739.90] I'm afraid uh all ventilation
[2739.90 → 2742.36] down this side the parts dude
[2742.36 → 2744.84] all ventilation down this side i
[2744.84 → 2748.20] believe the top too oh yep tons
[2748.20 → 2750.36] of ventilation um it was a
[2750.36 → 2752.46] different time and these vent
[2752.46 → 2754.34] holes are for you can actually
[2754.34 → 2757.50] see here for the CPU socket or
[2757.50 → 2760.16] for the CPU area all those ports
[2760.16 → 2761.42] on the CPU they're above the
[2761.42 → 2764.16] socket which means that the GPU
[2764.16 → 2767.58] is actually kinda going to starve
[2767.58 → 2769.48] for airflow so I think there's
[2769.48 → 2770.80] going to be some necessary
[2770.80 → 2772.58] modifications in order to put a
[2772.58 → 2773.90] more I don't remember that card
[2773.90 → 2775.80] having a yellow modern system here
[2775.80 → 2778.32] total probably would be my guess
[2778.32 → 2780.80] and then yeah to Luke's point the
[2780.80 → 2782.80] back this must be the original
[2782.80 → 2784.50] hardware that was in it, i
[2784.50 → 2786.06] actually don't know that for sure
[2786.06 → 2790.06] uh, but it's its it's got to be and
[2790.06 → 2792.66] then my understanding is that this
[2792.66 → 2796.14] is not like damage that happened at
[2796.14 → 2798.06] some point I think this was how they
[2798.06 → 2801.40] marked the cereal of which one it was
[2801.40 → 2804.42] um, so there's there are 300 holes here
[2804.42 → 2808.50] um and did how many units did they
[2808.50 → 2811.38] make did they make 300 units i
[2811.38 → 2813.16] actually I actually don't know how
[2813.16 → 2815.36] many they made Jean-Luc in full plane
[2815.36 → 2817.00] chat said careful the drilled hole
[2817.00 → 2818.42] tells valve which serial number you
[2818.42 → 2822.22] have oh okay yeah were you supposed
[2822.22 → 2824.48] to show that well I valve didn't send
[2824.48 → 2827.58] it to me right but did the person who
[2827.58 → 2830.08] sent it to you could they no it ended
[2830.08 → 2832.06] up in like a junk shop or something oh
[2832.06 → 2834.50] okay yeah I mean dude this was there
[2834.50 → 2835.60] was a very long time ago for valve to
[2835.60 → 2837.72] still be mad about a system they sent
[2837.72 → 2839.78] out 12 years ago I think is probably
[2839.78 → 2843.66] pretty unlikely you know you never know
[2843.66 → 2845.92] that uh there's an angle on there that
[2845.92 → 2849.40] looks rough uh yeah also should we try
[2849.40 → 2850.84] to open it should we open it yeah yeah
[2850.84 → 2853.38] yeah I think we should open it oh okay
[2853.38 → 2856.50] that just started going right that was
[2856.50 → 2858.24] not that bad all right, so there's the
[2858.24 → 2858.54] top
[2858.54 → 2861.88] looks a little hey you're right about the
[2861.88 → 2864.08] brand something like that the witch now
[2864.08 → 2865.92] this is oak oh yeah yeah
[2865.92 → 2868.40] yeah for sure uh and then yeah here's
[2868.40 → 2870.40] the internals so it's its actually a
[2870.40 → 2874.10] really thoughtfully laid out case um
[2874.10 → 2879.86] uses PCI like a hard PCIE riser so it
[2879.86 → 2882.42] uh so it orients the card is really
[2882.42 → 2884.54] solid actually yeah no it's no it's
[2884.54 → 2885.72] pretty cool so you have a hard riser
[2885.72 → 2887.28] coming out of here your card goes
[2887.28 → 2890.30] in right here your intake is like
[2890.30 → 2892.18] oh my god what were they what were they
[2892.18 → 2894.12] thinking here because this side is
[2894.12 → 2895.64] vented right so theoretically you're
[2895.64 → 2897.74] getting some air here but absolutely
[2897.74 → 2900.48] nothing here, but they're using a blower
[2900.48 → 2903.38] style cooler so that at least it's
[2903.38 → 2905.76] taking that hot air, and it's getting
[2905.76 → 2907.92] rid of it out the back of the system but
[2907.92 → 2910.80] it doesn't really have an intake fan
[2910.80 → 2913.64] right because your power supply that'll
[2913.64 → 2915.64] draw air in that so remember this was
[2915.64 → 2917.28] the side that had the vents on the top
[2917.28 → 2919.98] right so that'll draw air in and then the
[2919.98 → 2923.12] GPU doesn't blow it out, and we'll know
[2923.12 → 2926.12] the case doesn't have an air intake oh
[2926.12 → 2927.90] the general case this well oh wow
[2927.90 → 2931.88] that um that is loose yes okay so this
[2931.88 → 2933.64] will draw some air in, but you can see
[2933.64 → 2935.96] it's all it's all shrouded oh the fins
[2935.96 → 2937.58] on there too so it'll come right out
[2937.58 → 2941.44] here so the fins on the CPU uh oh yeah
[2941.44 → 2943.72] I got a little bit I got a little mangled
[2943.72 → 2945.64] there so both of these are drawing
[2945.64 → 2947.28] air in, but they're also exhausting it
[2947.28 → 2951.08] directly out, so oh man it's really hard to
[2951.08 → 2953.40] hold stuff up when I'm here it doesn't
[2953.40 → 2956.04] matter so the case itself doesn't have a
[2956.04 → 2959.48] single intake that provides any fresh air
[2959.48 → 2962.46] to this GPU like there 's's so it's
[2962.46 → 2965.02] negative air pressure because these are
[2965.02 → 2967.08] both in their own isolated airflow zones
[2967.08 → 2970.66] and then this one has a fan here right
[2970.66 → 2974.20] that is exhausting, but it has there's no
[2974.20 → 2977.84] equivalent air intake for the exhaust that
[2977.84 → 2980.02] is that is blowing out uh it's got a spot
[2980.02 → 2982.40] for a two and a half inch SSD here but
[2982.40 → 2984.24] pretty much the idea what I've been
[2984.24 → 2989.46] waiting for three and a half years
[2989.46 → 2994.14] is for valve to follow through on the
[2994.14 → 2995.98] commitment they made when they launched
[2995.98 → 2999.68] the steam deck three and a half years
[2999.68 → 3004.06] ago to create steam OS for desktop are
[3004.06 → 3005.14] you going to upgrade that machine and
[3005.14 → 3007.34] then install it on there that's sick and
[3007.34 → 3008.96] then this will be this will be my living
[3008.96 → 3012.24] room console that's fantastic could I ask
[3012.24 → 3015.56] no you can't have it no how much was it
[3015.56 → 3018.72] oh I don't actually know i I know I think i
[3018.72 → 3021.64] think we like to found it in an in like a
[3021.64 → 3024.02] junk pile oh no way yeah like it
[3024.02 → 3025.88] ended up at like a free geek equivalent
[3025.88 → 3027.40] or something and I think someone offered
[3027.40 → 3028.88] to send it to us or something like that I'm
[3028.88 → 3030.80] pretty sure we didn't pay for it wow so in
[3030.80 → 3033.32] terms of like you know buying stolen goods
[3033.32 → 3035.96] or whatever no uh we didn't like we
[3035.96 → 3038.46] didn't go looking for someone's coveted
[3038.46 → 3039.92] intellectual property or anything like
[3039.92 → 3042.64] that sure I mean I'd be curious to know
[3042.64 → 3044.54] if there's any if there's any out there
[3044.54 → 3051.24] so valve steam machine so they only
[3051.24 → 3053.42] sent this out to like gaming press I think
[3053.42 → 3057.18] oh yeah ebay has got nothing they've
[3057.18 → 3061.40] got literal actual like steam machines so
[3061.40 → 3065.16] sorry you won't be you won't be finding
[3065.16 → 3067.78] one of those there claim that is your
[3067.78 → 3069.56] upgrade you have the right no I don't
[3069.56 → 3071.94] think so unfortunately that's not how the
[3071.94 → 3072.48] terms work
[3072.48 → 3078.16] it's freaking cool though i uh oh is that a
[3078.16 → 3078.44] fan
[3078.44 → 3082.08] no it's not nope it's just a little show
[3082.08 → 3085.64] I mean it's already prepaid yeah, and you're
[3085.64 → 3086.82] replacing all the hardware it's probably
[3086.82 → 3087.18] fine
[3087.18 → 3089.92] yeah I'm dude I'm you refinish the case
[3089.92 → 3090.28] at all
[3090.28 → 3093.94] so okay are you going to leave some that
[3093.94 → 3096.06] is a hard question that's a tough one
[3096.06 → 3096.78] because
[3096.78 → 3103.02] the wanting a beautiful system in me would
[3103.02 → 3105.24] be like yeah you know what I really want
[3105.24 → 3108.02] to do is I want to do like uh I want to
[3108.02 → 3110.26] do a cool colour scheme I want to I want to
[3110.26 → 3113.28] pull out this internal mesh and then I want
[3113.28 → 3115.60] to paint that like an accent colour and
[3115.60 → 3117.16] that'd be super cool and then I want to
[3117.16 → 3119.16] do this top like whatever and then I want
[3119.16 → 3122.00] to do like a hand painted you know third
[3122.00 → 3124.54] colour here like like like a cool like
[3124.54 → 3127.50] red or like a gold or like a cyan yeah
[3127.50 → 3129.70] yeah yeah something cool like that
[3129.70 → 3132.22] cyan would look sick actually right like i
[3132.22 → 3136.50] just I wanted, but then it feels wrong
[3136.50 → 3136.82] right
[3136.82 → 3139.96] yeah doesn't it feel a little wrong I'm
[3139.96 → 3142.70] unsure but i I think making significant
[3142.70 → 3144.58] changes yes but what if you like cleaned
[3144.58 → 3145.44] up some of the dings
[3145.44 → 3148.56] you wouldn't be able to do that though
[3148.56 → 3150.38] this isn't like painting it this is
[3150.38 → 3153.70] anodized aluminum okay so you would have
[3153.70 → 3156.16] to you'd have to you'd have to strip the
[3156.16 → 3158.00] anodization which for my understanding
[3158.00 → 3159.58] makes me sad actually is
[3159.58 → 3164.48] UN is UN um you're not restoring at that
[3164.48 → 3165.54] point you're kind of modifying
[3165.54 → 3169.24] what if you painted it the same no it's
[3169.24 → 3171.68] it can be challenging removing anodization
[3171.68 → 3174.96] can be quite challenging got it um
[3174.96 → 3177.70] someone said you have a CNC machine make
[3177.70 → 3179.70] a new hood I mean I could but that's not
[3179.70 → 3181.06] no yeah you don't want to make a new
[3181.06 → 3183.36] hood it has to be the same one yeah for
[3183.36 → 3185.82] sure that's that's for sure man I'd want
[3185.82 → 3188.02] to do like a super cool colour scheme
[3188.02 → 3190.12] though like a baby blue and yellow or
[3190.12 → 3191.96] something for like what if you have like
[3191.96 → 3194.18] like a really out there colour scheme
[3194.18 → 3195.58] you have to do it as a wrap you have
[3195.58 → 3197.88] two oh you have two TVs you have the
[3197.88 → 3199.80] upstairs and downstairs what if you did
[3199.80 → 3202.66] what if you recreated this and made it
[3202.66 → 3204.58] cool in the way that you would want and
[3204.58 → 3207.68] also have the OG what if you had two uh
[3207.68 → 3210.38] I mean I'll just have to brace myself
[3210.38 → 3212.98] for all the remember when Linus tech
[3212.98 → 3215.42] tips was relatable comments but other
[3215.42 → 3217.02] than that I guess I don't see a downside
[3217.02 → 3219.72] uh it would be those comments are gonna
[3219.72 → 3220.40] show up anyway
[3220.40 → 3223.70] there are a lot of aspects of this that
[3223.70 → 3227.00] would be pretty untrivial to recreate
[3227.00 → 3230.88] like we basically have to you could 3d
[3230.88 → 3232.04] print a lot of it but like
[3232.04 → 3235.82] I'm not going to commit to that I'm
[3235.82 → 3237.56] definitely yeah not going to
[3237.56 → 3239.14] commit to that right now either it's just
[3239.14 → 3241.22] potentially an option that's sick
[3241.22 → 3244.08] though does it do the ring around the
[3244.08 → 3245.86] power button light up it looks like it did
[3245.86 → 3247.92] in the picture I believe it does but i
[3247.92 → 3249.26] don't think I've ever tried to power
[3249.26 → 3249.94] this one up
[3249.94 → 3254.14] you should, we should do it right now you
[3254.14 → 3255.96] want to do it right now I mean
[3255.96 → 3260.82] do you have a c13 we can try I have no
[3260.82 → 3262.54] idea man uh
[3262.54 → 3267.26] Daniel lesser i I think Luke would like us
[3267.26 → 3270.38] to obtain a c13 power cable he's on it
[3270.38 → 3275.74] yeah yeah Dan will have a way
[3275.74 → 3278.92] I'm sure man I wish the dings weren't in
[3278.92 → 3279.52] the front
[3279.52 → 3281.88] yeah all the dings are in the front like
[3281.88 → 3282.68] the back is
[3282.68 → 3284.28] okay no there's some pretty big dings in
[3284.28 → 3285.70] the back okay the dings are everywhere
[3285.70 → 3287.66] dude I'm so excited
[3287.66 → 3289.88] it's survived it's so compact it's so
[3289.88 → 3290.94] console like
[3290.94 → 3292.88] if valve had just
[3292.88 → 3295.92] ponied up, and they had done the same
[3295.92 → 3297.22] thing they did with the steam deck
[3297.22 → 3300.48] where they subsidized the hardware I think
[3300.48 → 3302.76] we would have I think we'd have a steam
[3302.76 → 3304.38] like desktop console
[3304.38 → 3307.56] yeah like I mean the software wasn't
[3307.56 → 3309.66] ready yet though that's true it was so
[3309.66 → 3311.56] far off they waited for the right time
[3311.56 → 3313.84] ultimately letting them cook for
[3313.84 → 3314.66] longer was
[3314.66 → 3317.42] was also good it was a good thing
[3317.42 → 3321.06] thank you Mr Daniel can we uh
[3321.06 → 3322.88] can we display it is HDMI right
[3322.88 → 3323.96] do you want to
[3323.96 → 3328.34] oh I mean yeah I guess mine
[3328.34 → 3329.12] okay
[3329.12 → 3332.64] no damn it
[3332.64 → 3335.00] no what a dick
[3335.00 → 3338.26] did the stream hear that that was good
[3338.26 → 3340.42] that was good that was good that was
[3340.42 → 3342.06] good I can't there you go that was very
[3342.06 → 3342.36] good
[3342.36 → 3346.26] USB
[3346.26 → 3348.92] does it make your mother uncomfortable
[3348.92 → 3350.86] that we talk about your penis so much on
[3350.86 → 3351.22] this show
[3351.22 → 3354.08] probably I mean she's seen it a thousand
[3354.08 → 3354.40] times
[3354.40 → 3356.66] I guess it doesn't really matter
[3356.66 → 3357.88] um
[3357.88 → 3358.38] sorry
[3358.38 → 3360.60] not in like a weird way
[3360.60 → 3362.40] you know in like uh
[3362.40 → 3363.44] when I was just
[3363.44 → 3365.24] all over himself you know
[3365.24 → 3366.40] i was going to say
[3366.40 → 3367.92] yours too
[3367.92 → 3373.44] okay let's try to turn it on
[3373.44 → 3375.62] yeah good luck
[3375.62 → 3377.26] there's no chicken
[3377.26 → 3383.12] yeah
[3383.12 → 3386.48] yeah the proximity to discussing people's
[3386.48 → 3388.92] parents and making seduction jokes is too
[3388.92 → 3389.48] close Dan
[3389.48 → 3390.20] yeah yeah yeah
[3390.20 → 3390.96] too close
[3390.96 → 3392.26] what's what's going on here
[3392.26 → 3393.86] uh well I don't know I pressed what i
[3393.86 → 3395.00] think is the power button
[3395.00 → 3396.38] um
[3396.38 → 3397.64] and
[3397.64 → 3399.58] nothing happened sir
[3399.58 → 3400.82] the banner Dan
[3400.82 → 3402.56] the banner
[3402.56 → 3403.32] sure
[3403.32 → 3405.70] oh they oh yeah no they can't
[3405.70 → 3406.44] I'm working on it
[3406.44 → 3408.46] there's not a lot to
[3408.46 → 3410.08] see that isn't happening
[3410.08 → 3411.70] that was a very nimble and good save
[3411.70 → 3412.30] thank you
[3412.30 → 3414.34] did we try to bypass the front panel headers
[3414.34 → 3415.64] I mean yeah we could I mean
[3415.64 → 3418.00] how much troubleshooting do you want to do on the wan show
[3418.00 → 3418.56] that's not what the show is
[3418.56 → 3421.42] this is probably the best and most interesting part of the wan show so far
[3421.42 → 3422.56] um okay
[3422.56 → 3423.40] I'm not even
[3423.40 → 3426.70] I think you might just be a bit of a Val fanboy
[3426.70 → 3428.92] and a little bit extra excite right now
[3428.92 → 3430.16] the 30% is a lot okay
[3430.16 → 3431.76] the 30% is a large amount
[3431.76 → 3438.28] dude it's like it's like buried in there
[3438.28 → 3440.08] brings studios video has info for us
[3440.08 → 3441.70] uh
[3441.70 → 3444.16] I'm not going to be able to like watch that right now
[3444.16 → 3445.60] is this power supply on
[3445.60 → 3446.36] is the outlet work
[3446.36 → 3448.12] oh I don't know
[3448.12 → 3449.98] uh
[3449.98 → 3452.74] I suspect the system is broken you guys
[3452.74 → 3453.48] I really don't
[3453.48 → 3456.94] I also have to say of course brings studios has a video on this
[3456.94 → 3459.78] there's no power switch on the power supply so
[3459.78 → 3464.08] yeah i I guys i think he's dead I think he's dead Jim
[3464.08 → 3465.86] I think that uh
[3465.86 → 3470.18] the best course of action is for us to put new hardware in it and make us sick
[3470.18 → 3471.04] you could buy
[3471.04 → 3471.54] yeah
[3471.54 → 3473.04] anyway we don't have to but
[3473.04 → 3475.88] sorry what do you want me to do
[3475.88 → 3478.22] you could bypass the pass through and plug directly into the power supply
[3478.22 → 3478.86] i really
[3478.86 → 3481.08] and you could try to bridge the header just
[3481.08 → 3482.14] I can't reach it
[3482.14 → 3483.40] look it's
[3483.40 → 3485.64] the motherboard's completely covered brother
[3485.64 → 3486.22] well we could
[3486.22 → 3488.72] I'm sure you have a lttstore.com
[3488.72 → 3489.62] screwdriver
[3489.62 → 3492.12] readily accessible at all periods of time
[3492.12 → 3493.02] yes I do
[3493.02 → 3493.82] so you can't tell me
[3493.82 → 3495.14] a few little screws
[3495.14 → 3497.46] are going to defeat the great line of Sebastian
[3497.46 → 3499.42] do you want me to troubleshoot it back here
[3499.42 → 3499.94] but
[3499.94 → 3501.44] see if I can figure it out
[3501.44 → 3501.90] we could also do that
[3501.90 → 3503.54] we could continue the show
[3503.54 → 3504.62] and Dan could
[3504.62 → 3505.82] uh
[3505.82 → 3507.22] solve the troubleshooting things
[3507.22 → 3508.06] oh my god you guys
[3508.06 → 3509.20] I could just call
[3509.20 → 3510.36] Jordan who is
[3510.36 → 3511.52] the writer for this project
[3511.52 → 3511.90] and be like
[3511.90 → 3513.14] hey have you tested the system
[3513.14 → 3513.76] does it work
[3513.76 → 3516.62] that would probably be easier
[3516.62 → 3517.20] okay
[3517.20 → 3518.18] no it is not that
[3518.18 → 3519.10] that is not the problem
[3519.10 → 3519.80] okay cool
[3519.80 → 3521.18] one problem down
[3521.18 → 3522.06] oh my god
[3522.06 → 3526.16] it's good
[3526.16 → 3526.86] it's good
[3526.86 → 3528.88] you're killing me
[3528.88 → 3530.72] we don't have to do it
[3530.72 → 3531.10] but it's just
[3531.10 → 3531.96] it's very interesting
[3531.96 → 3533.70] for something we don't have to do
[3533.70 → 3535.54] you're sure putting an awful lot of pressure
[3535.54 → 3536.76] to do it
[3536.76 → 3538.08] do we really have to do anything
[3538.08 → 3541.02] what does that even mean
[3541.02 → 3543.02] that means that we should do this
[3543.02 → 3547.46] fine
[3547.46 → 3548.26] we can
[3548.26 → 3550.28] we can go as far as
[3550.28 → 3551.00] bridging
[3551.00 → 3552.40] the power switch
[3552.40 → 3553.14] on the motherboard
[3553.14 → 3554.28] are we passing it to Dan
[3554.28 → 3554.54] and just
[3554.54 → 3555.62] Dan's going to have to do it
[3555.62 → 3556.62] because we're going to have to
[3556.62 → 3557.54] do when show
[3557.54 → 3558.06] at some point
[3558.06 → 3558.62] yeah that's fine
[3558.62 → 3559.18] all right
[3559.18 → 3560.86] Dan come
[3560.86 → 3561.26] I'm coming
[3561.26 → 3561.80] okay
[3561.80 → 3565.74] oh here it's going the wrong way
[3565.74 → 3566.88] I got it
[3566.88 → 3567.02] oh
[3567.02 → 3568.60] knocked my mic twice there
[3568.60 → 3569.20] sorry people
[3569.20 → 3570.80] okay
[3570.80 → 3573.70] now Dan can't even
[3573.70 → 3574.68] do his job
[3574.68 → 3576.36] which is about to get more difficult
[3576.36 → 3577.06] because we're
[3577.06 → 3578.50] about to talk about
[3578.50 → 3579.28] the
[3579.28 → 3580.88] creator warehouse stuff
[3580.88 → 3581.40] woo
[3581.40 → 3582.66] this week
[3582.66 → 3584.02] we have an exclusive
[3584.02 → 3585.76] float plane drop
[3585.76 → 3587.14] on ltdstore.com
[3587.14 → 3588.54] if you're a float plane subscriber
[3588.54 → 3589.46] you already know
[3589.46 → 3589.94] that it's been
[3589.94 → 3590.54] Sarah week

[3591.94 → 3593.56] around our designer
[3593.56 → 3594.36] Sarah
[3594.36 → 3595.28] just today
[3595.28 → 3596.22] we released her trip
[3596.22 → 3597.62] to dinosaur town
[3597.62 → 3599.12] aka crueller
[3599.12 → 3600.12] where she visited
[3600.12 → 3601.60] the royal Tyrell museum
[3601.60 → 3602.60] um
[3602.60 → 3603.78] point of clarification
[3603.78 → 3604.48] on that
[3604.48 → 3606.52] did leg
[3606.52 → 3607.64] actually pay
[3607.64 → 3608.52] for her and Sammy
[3608.52 → 3609.32] to go to crueller
[3609.32 → 3609.68] as
[3609.68 → 3610.46] I think so
[3610.46 → 3611.50] how does
[3611.50 → 3612.84] how did that work
[3612.84 → 3613.74] as
[3613.74 → 3615.32] so that was the video budget
[3615.32 → 3617.40] so it's
[3617.40 → 3618.88] so it seems to me
[3618.88 → 3622.10] so here it is
[3622.10 → 3623.60] uh
[3623.60 → 3625.24] where was the thing

[3856.44 → 3856.96] to do a topic
[3856.96 → 3857.54] really quick
[3857.54 → 3858.52] sure
[3858.52 → 3858.84] I just need to
[3858.84 → 3859.36] find out what's
[3859.36 → 3860.08] going on
[3860.08 → 3861.00] can I just do
[3861.00 → 3861.40] the other two
[3861.40 → 3861.96] sponsors Dan
[3861.96 → 3863.40] no, no no, no
[3863.40 → 3863.76] we should do
[3863.76 → 3864.30] some topics
[3864.30 → 3864.86] okay
[3864.86 → 3868.40] do you have
[3868.40 → 3868.84] any that i
[3868.84 → 3869.34] could do
[3869.34 → 3869.88] yeah we should
[3869.88 → 3870.30] do a couple
[3870.30 → 3870.86] merch messages
[3870.86 → 3871.90] probably not
[3871.90 → 3872.90] directly for
[3872.90 → 3873.70] you
[3873.70 → 3874.94] if there's
[3874.94 → 3875.54] general ones
[3875.54 → 3875.84] I can do
[3875.84 → 3876.40] those or i
[3876.40 → 3876.78] can talk
[3876.78 → 3877.78] about uh
[3877.78 → 3878.04] we should
[3878.04 → 3878.36] explain
[3878.36 → 3879.00] merch messages
[3879.00 → 3879.58] so the way
[3879.58 → 3879.92] to send a
[3879.92 → 3880.40] merch message
[3880.40 → 3880.94] is to add
[3880.94 → 3881.34] something to
[3881.34 → 3881.68] your cart
[3881.68 → 3882.98] on lttstore.com
[3882.98 → 3883.80] once you add
[3883.80 → 3884.26] something to
[3884.26 → 3884.66] your cart
[3884.66 → 3885.14] say for
[3885.14 → 3885.60] example
[3885.60 → 3886.64] uh
[3886.64 → 3888.08] uh
[3888.08 → 3888.44] okay
[3888.44 → 3889.52] so once you
[3889.52 → 3889.92] add something
[3889.92 → 3890.54] to your cart
[3890.54 → 3891.26] say for example
[3891.26 → 3891.70] one of our
[3891.70 → 3892.46] new t-shirt
[3892.46 → 3893.22] colours available
[3893.22 → 3894.26] in long sleeve
[3894.26 → 3895.52] and short sleeve
[3895.52 → 3896.52] and available
[3896.52 → 3897.06] in regular
[3897.06 → 3897.82] and tall
[3897.82 → 3898.24] lengths
[3898.24 → 3898.90] that's right
[3898.90 → 3899.60] let's go
[3899.60 → 3900.52] so you could
[3900.52 → 3901.20] get a tall
[3901.20 → 3902.06] medium shirt
[3902.06 → 3902.76] my god
[3902.76 → 3903.20] is this ever
[3903.20 → 3903.50] a lot of
[3903.50 → 3903.72] skews
[3903.72 → 3904.72] imagine it all
[3904.72 → 3905.46] imagine all
[3905.46 → 3906.12] of these colours
[3906.12 → 3906.90] in different
[3906.90 → 3907.26] lengths
[3907.26 → 3907.90] in different
[3907.90 → 3908.34] sizes
[3908.34 → 3909.24] and imagine
[3909.24 → 3909.50] why
[3909.50 → 3910.10] out of stock
[3910.10 → 3910.60] some of them
[3910.60 → 3911.00] are out of
[3911.00 → 3911.34] stock
[3911.34 → 3912.30] yeah it totally
[3912.30 → 3913.02] makes sense if you
[3913.02 → 3913.54] think about it
[3913.54 → 3914.48] anyway the point is
[3914.48 → 3915.58] you add that to your
[3915.58 → 3916.68] cart, and you'll see
[3916.68 → 3917.46] the interface for
[3917.46 → 3918.06] merch messages
[3918.06 → 3919.46] you can either make
[3919.46 → 3920.28] it is anonymous or you
[3920.28 → 3921.14] can show your first
[3921.14 → 3921.76] name and last
[3921.76 → 3922.78] initial you can leave
[3922.78 → 3923.44] a merch message for
[3923.44 → 3924.14] the show it'll go to
[3924.14 → 3925.94] producer Dan who is
[3925.94 → 3926.98] working on a computer
[3926.98 → 3928.36] and also will reply to
[3928.36 → 3929.14] your merch message
[3929.14 → 3930.44] yeah we think both
[3930.44 → 3931.50] we think merch messages
[3931.50 → 3932.26] are great because
[3932.26 → 3933.04] instead of just
[3933.04 → 3934.64] throwing money at
[3934.64 → 3935.58] your screen we
[3935.58 → 3936.72] don't we don't
[3936.72 → 3937.28] really want your
[3937.28 → 3939.26] donations we would
[3939.26 → 3940.30] much rather that you
[3940.30 → 3941.04] just you know get
[3941.04 → 3941.80] some high quality
[3941.80 → 3943.00] merchandise in the
[3943.00 → 3943.98] mail if you
[3943.98 → 3944.98] want to support the
[3944.98 → 3947.02] show so lttstore.com

[3949.76 → 3950.94] right Dan's gonna
[3950.94 → 3952.06] have us reply to a
[3952.06 → 3952.82] couple merch messages
[3952.82 → 3953.54] that's what happens
[3953.54 → 3954.30] when he curates them
[3954.30 → 3954.86] this was the most
[3954.86 → 3956.10] disjointed merch
[3956.10 → 3957.90] message thing ever I
[3957.90 → 3958.78] really want to know
[3958.78 → 3959.54] what's going on with
[3959.54 → 3960.52] this gift card promo
[3960.52 → 3964.10] make another call I
[3964.10 → 3964.66] have one here for
[3964.66 → 3968.50] Luke so hi LLD Luke
[3968.50 → 3969.84] did you get a chance
[3969.84 → 3970.90] to tour any ESA
[3970.90 → 3972.24] facilities in Germany
[3972.24 → 3973.84] they held their open
[3973.84 → 3974.66] days roughly at the
[3974.66 → 3976.00] same time as IFA
[3976.00 → 3979.48] I had no idea that
[3979.48 → 3980.78] was a thing I had no
[3980.78 → 3981.60] idea they even ever
[3981.60 → 3982.74] did that let alone
[3982.74 → 3983.66] that it happened while
[3983.66 → 3984.48] I was there that would
[3984.48 → 3985.58] have been sick I would
[3985.58 → 3986.38] have a thousand percent
[3986.38 → 3987.54] did that done that
[3987.54 → 3989.50] ESA is the European
[3989.50 → 3990.48] Space Agency just in
[3990.48 → 3991.26] case people did not
[3991.26 → 3991.64] know
[3991.64 → 3995.58] oh no
[3995.58 → 3998.38] just leave it
[3998.38 → 4002.02] yeah anyway separate
[4002.02 → 4002.76] thing but yeah no
[4002.76 → 4003.94] that's that's that's
[4003.94 → 4004.80] really cool I like
[4004.80 → 4005.40] that they do open
[4005.40 → 4006.46] days it was really
[4006.46 → 4007.38] fun I don't think it
[4007.38 → 4008.26] got a crazy amount of
[4008.26 → 4009.16] views I don't know if
[4009.16 → 4009.86] it was the title or
[4009.86 → 4010.58] something but you guys
[4010.58 → 4013.06] should go watch a
[4013.06 → 4014.36] Linus video
[4014.36 → 4017.14] did it end up doing
[4017.14 → 4018.48] better did I just bad
[4018.48 → 4019.42] talk it for no reason
[4019.42 → 4021.94] I did, but you should
[4021.94 → 4022.56] go watch anyway
[4022.56 → 4023.14] because it deserves
[4023.14 → 4024.36] even more views the
[4024.36 → 4025.90] Canada's Las Vegas
[4025.90 → 4027.00] sphere is here and I
[4027.00 → 4028.48] game on it video is
[4028.48 → 4029.66] awesome there's a
[4029.66 → 4030.42] there's a place up
[4030.42 → 4031.70] here called the HR
[4031.70 → 4034.70] McMillan Space Centre
[4034.70 → 4035.14] or something but
[4035.14 → 4036.04] there's a thing that
[4036.04 → 4036.46] they call the
[4036.46 → 4037.40] planetarium in there
[4037.40 → 4038.44] which is this really
[4038.44 → 4039.18] really cool theatre
[4039.18 → 4040.26] and like basically
[4040.26 → 4041.78] everyone that lives
[4041.78 → 4042.52] here when they were a
[4042.52 → 4043.78] kid went to go see
[4043.78 → 4045.08] things on the
[4045.08 → 4047.90] planetarium and
[4047.90 → 4048.46] remembers that
[4048.46 → 4049.16] experience because
[4049.16 → 4050.36] it's just awesome
[4050.36 → 4052.22] and they're doing an
[4052.22 → 4053.22] upgrade to it that
[4053.22 → 4055.28] looks amazing and
[4055.28 → 4056.24] Linus got some
[4056.24 → 4057.70] really cool behind
[4057.70 → 4059.26] the scenes access to
[4059.26 → 4061.08] the hardware and how
[4061.08 → 4061.62] they're doing it and
[4061.62 → 4062.32] some of the history of
[4062.32 → 4063.08] that place because it's
[4063.08 → 4064.04] like genuinely really
[4064.04 → 4065.20] interesting and they
[4065.20 → 4066.28] play a game on it and
[4066.28 → 4067.94] even just the act
[4067.94 → 4068.82] of playing the game on
[4068.82 → 4069.82] it is really
[4069.82 → 4070.50] interesting because of
[4070.50 → 4071.18] how they have to like
[4071.18 → 4072.00] kind of warp it to make
[4072.00 → 4072.86] it works on that screen
[4072.86 → 4074.00] and the screen having
[4074.00 → 4075.38] holes in it so it's
[4075.38 → 4077.78] you can hear acoustics
[4077.78 → 4078.46] through the screen
[4078.46 → 4079.14] and Ada Ada Ada
[4079.14 → 4080.52] Ada it's a very
[4080.52 → 4082.16] interesting video space
[4082.16 → 4083.82] stuff is cool I don't
[4083.82 → 4084.26] really have anything
[4084.26 → 4085.22] else to say I wish I
[4085.22 → 4086.62] knew that ESA thing I
[4086.62 → 4087.26] will keep that in mind
[4087.26 → 4088.98] in the future but yeah
[4088.98 → 4090.16] yeah so someone in
[4090.16 → 4093.36] chat Cam Sta bro said I
[4093.36 → 4094.04] have very positive
[4094.04 → 4094.80] memories of HR
[4094.80 → 4096.56] McMillan everyone I
[4096.56 → 4097.74] know that's been there
[4097.74 → 4098.38] when they were a kid
[4098.38 → 4099.14] has very positive
[4099.14 → 4099.76] memories of HR
[4099.76 → 4100.16] McMillan
[4100.16 → 4104.18] I cannot reach Dave
[4104.18 → 4107.10] this is my fault he
[4107.10 → 4109.28] messaged me before the
[4109.28 → 4114.86] show today at yesterday
[4114.86 → 4119.22] sounds good we are
[4119.22 → 4120.86] testing a 10% gift card
[4120.86 → 4122.50] promotion this weekend to
[4122.50 → 4126.78] see how it goes I had a
[4126.78 → 4130.32] full day and five and a
[4130.32 → 4132.88] half hours to say oh my
[4132.88 → 4135.22] god no not before Black
[4135.22 → 4135.62] Friday
[4135.62 → 4139.50] what are you changing Dan
[4139.50 → 4146.04] let's leave it till midnight
[4146.04 → 4150.58] anyone who watches live or
[4150.58 → 4151.92] watches the GOD immediately
[4151.92 → 4155.00] my loss is your gain if you
[4155.00 → 4156.08] buy gift cards with gift
[4156.08 → 4157.22] cards we will cancel the
[4157.22 → 4157.72] whole thing
[4157.72 → 4160.60] that's I was just gonna
[4160.60 → 4161.02] message you
[4161.02 → 4163.94] okay we good do we have an
[4163.94 → 4166.88] accord please buy something
[4166.88 → 4167.98] profitable with it
[4167.98 → 4170.38] because you could absolutely
[4170.38 → 4172.46] go from the cheapest gift
[4172.46 → 4173.98] card to the most expensive
[4173.98 → 4175.30] one I know multiples of the
[4175.30 → 4176.38] most expensive one but if you
[4176.38 → 4177.78] do that we will cancel your
[4177.78 → 4179.30] order, so there's really no
[4179.30 → 4180.58] point doing that whereas if
[4180.58 → 4183.74] you do this now in good
[4183.74 → 4185.16] faith and order one gift
[4185.16 → 4187.08] card for with the discount
[4187.08 → 4189.48] then we will leave it alone
[4189.48 → 4190.74] we will honour it even though
[4190.74 → 4192.66] I think the timing for this
[4192.66 → 4195.38] is you just know there was
[4195.38 → 4197.14] not optimal some person
[4197.14 → 4198.06] sitting at their computer
[4198.06 → 4199.64] infinite money glitching gift
[4199.64 → 4201.36] cards that just went oh
[4201.36 → 4205.20] some person probably a bunch
[4205.20 → 4207.50] yeah, but guys like to come on
[4207.50 → 4213.16] yeah, yeah wild for calm five
[4213.16 → 4214.88] said what's profitable I will
[4214.88 → 4216.14] show you will show you how
[4216.14 → 4220.00] to tell so okay if something
[4220.00 → 4222.22] has a little discount little
[4222.22 → 4224.72] nice discount probably
[4224.72 → 4228.72] profitable if something has a
[4228.72 → 4230.28] let's see do we still have the
[4230.28 → 4234.08] oh yeah no the like the
[4234.08 → 4236.24] like Uber clearance stuff is gone
[4236.24 → 4238.10] so if something has like an Uber
[4238.10 → 4240.28] clearance like 50% plus
[4240.28 → 4243.06] discount 40% discount on it
[4243.06 → 4245.38] probably it's a loss-leader
[4245.38 → 4247.14] that's generally the way to tell
[4247.14 → 4251.18] so just yeah do me a solid if you
[4251.18 → 4253.00] must have it before Black Friday
[4253.00 → 4255.38] just don't just load up on loss
[4255.38 → 4256.54] leaders if you could just find
[4256.54 → 4258.58] something else as well
[4258.58 → 4260.00] that would be swell so it sounds
[4260.00 → 4262.34] like they do block it Dan from
[4262.34 → 4263.54] what people in full plate chat are
[4263.54 → 4266.54] saying is you can't buy just a gift
[4266.54 → 4269.52] card with just a gift card yeah that
[4269.52 → 4271.26] wouldn't make any you can split the
[4271.26 → 4273.44] transaction you could buy just a gift
[4273.44 → 4275.28] card with a gift card and some money
[4275.28 → 4278.54] oh okay don't do that that's that's
[4278.54 → 4282.54] the gist that I'm getting okay uh
[4282.54 → 4287.58] okay cool good chat
[4287.58 → 4293.02] style 451 says, so the gift cards are
[4293.02 → 4295.32] profitable with their teeny tiny 10%
[4295.32 → 4298.80] discount not how that works
[4298.80 → 4304.42] yeah okay oh my god oh my god there's
[4304.42 → 4306.08] 42 merge messages in the queue
[4306.08 → 4309.40] we have made a terrible mistake
[4309.40 → 4312.46] how you're doing Dan what have you done
[4312.46 → 4315.82] um well technically it wasn't him
[4315.82 → 4318.12] yeah usually it is, and I'm down with
[4318.12 → 4322.88] that okay but this time oh man okay
[4322.88 → 4325.24] uh let's just do a topic why don't we
[4325.24 → 4328.16] do a topic let's pick some good news
[4328.16 → 4330.90] uh let's see South Korean government
[4330.90 → 4333.00] loses a bunch of money in a fire or data
[4333.00 → 4335.90] in a fire oh no uh Logitech bricks it's

[4338.56 → 4342.10] acquires Arduino no, no for it is locking
[4342.10 → 4343.86] basic navigation behind a subscription
[4343.86 → 4348.52] no uh oh Synology yeah hey this isn't
[4348.52 → 4350.02] someone that I was expecting to give
[4350.02 → 4353.36] good news on no but on October 8th
[4353.36 → 4357.14] Synology announced DSM 7.3 along with
[4357.14 → 4360.82] expanded storage flexibility which
[4360.82 → 4364.94] less storage flexibility is what that
[4364.94 → 4367.42] means yeah it means temporarily for a
[4367.42 → 4370.06] short period of time they had reduced
[4370.06 → 4373.56] storage flexibility, and they are back to
[4373.56 → 4375.78] status quo they have walked back the
[4375.78 → 4378.46] unpopular change that restricted the
[4378.46 → 4380.46] use of third-party hard drives that they
[4380.46 → 4383.08] made earlier this year literally it
[4383.08 → 4385.78] didn't even last for a year Synology
[4385.78 → 4387.58] stated in their announcement this
[4387.58 → 4389.62] provides users greater flexibility while
[4389.62 → 4391.70] Synology continues to expand the lineup of
[4391.70 → 4393.12] officially verified drives that meet
[4393.12 → 4395.52] long-term reliability standards by the
[4395.52 → 4398.66] way full disclosure I am invested in
[4398.66 → 4402.16] Esther the makers of Hex OS who are
[4402.16 → 4404.10] making an operating system that I hope
[4404.10 → 4406.28] will make Synology completely obsolete
[4406.28 → 4409.86] someday so far they're not there yet but
[4409.86 → 4413.62] they do have some big news today so it's
[4413.62 → 4415.66] actually kind of convenient that Synology
[4415.66 → 4418.32] more like gave us a reason to talk about
[4418.32 → 4422.00] closure not disclosure am I right audience
[4422.00 → 4424.48] what ad closure you said fold
[4424.48 → 4427.56] disclosure I'm invested in Hex OS also
[4427.56 → 4429.08] they're amazing look at all these cool
[4429.08 → 4431.68] features that sound like an ad closure
[4431.68 → 4433.82] not a disclosure you want to hear
[4433.82 → 4438.74] something deal with it no okay I don't
[4438.74 → 4441.38] know dude John texted me I'm not invested
[4441.38 → 4443.14] in either of these companies and what
[4443.14 → 4444.78] Synology did suck and calling it
[4444.78 → 4447.14] expanded storage flexibility is also just
[4447.14 → 4452.36] complete BS and makes me even not more
[4452.36 → 4454.72] upset than the original status, but I am
[4454.72 → 4459.34] now still displeased okay oh man dude
[4459.34 → 4461.40] and I have a Synology device at home
[4461.40 → 4463.32] okay what is going on, so I click the
[4463.32 → 4465.00] blog aiming to not use it in the
[4465.00 → 4466.72] thinking I would find the update, but it's
[4466.72 → 4468.40] not in the blog it's apparently in
[4468.40 → 4469.02] docs
[4469.02 → 4475.28] what did okay docs.hexos.com
[4475.28 → 4480.04] slash blog do you have two blogs hey
[4480.04 → 4483.36] that's illegal everyone gets issued one
[4483.36 → 4486.98] blog they have two blogs don't do that
[4486.98 → 4490.32] hashtag just okay doesn't matter the
[4490.32 → 4493.40] point is by enabling experimental features
[4493.40 → 4494.66] and settings preferences you can now
[4494.66 → 4497.66] access the custom script option for app
[4497.66 → 4500.50] installs this is one of the big features
[4500.50 → 4502.02] that I think is going to really set
[4502.02 → 4505.42] hex OS apart is easy installation of
[4505.42 → 4508.56] curated apps from there you can tweak
[4508.56 → 4510.36] existing installation scripts create entirely
[4510.36 → 4511.68] new ones and share them with the
[4511.68 → 4513.24] community or submit them to the
[4513.24 → 4516.36] official hex OS curation templates this
[4516.36 → 4518.08] is pretty cool they also launched their
[4518.08 → 4520.04] official documentation site a centralized
[4520.04 → 4522.36] resources to bring together getting
[4522.36 → 4523.88] started guides feature documentation
[4523.88 → 4526.34] troubleshooting help etc first flight
[4526.34 → 4528.78] improvements this was actually based on
[4528.78 → 4532.16] Robert Oaks he's one of our
[4532.16 → 4534.22] editors we did his AMD ultimate tech
[4534.22 → 4535.88] upgrade very recently I think it's
[4535.88 → 4538.34] coming going up in the next few days and
[4538.34 → 4540.72] I ran into some issues with the first
[4540.72 → 4543.02] flight the sort of setup wizard, and I was
[4543.02 → 4544.78] like hey can you fix that, and they did
[4544.78 → 4548.22] pretty neat folder wizard much like manual
[4548.22 → 4551.00] pool creation etc etc etc looking ahead okay
[4551.00 → 4555.04] this is a big deal because one of the big
[4555.04 → 4558.88] criticisms of hex us hex us back
[4558.88 → 4562.44] when they first announced it was hey why do I
[4562.44 → 4565.44] need an account and why do I need to access the
[4565.44 → 4568.78] control dashboard for a NAS for my NAS with my
[4568.78 → 4571.78] hard drives with my data on them through a cloud
[4571.78 → 4577.10] interface and hex us the hex us team heard that
[4577.10 → 4581.72] feedback and said hey before we go out of beta we
[4581.72 → 4584.30] will have a local UI there are reasons that we
[4584.30 → 4587.38] had to do it this way first, but before we go
[4587.38 → 4590.52] out of beta we will have a local UI, and it's
[4590.52 → 4592.58] coming good command deck remains our primary
[4592.58 → 4594.86] interface for initial setup and for remote
[4594.86 → 4597.78] access, but the local UI ensures you'll have
[4597.78 → 4599.48] access to the hex us interface for system
[4599.48 → 4601.54] management even during command deck maintenance
[4601.54 → 4605.46] windows this is a core component of our 1.0 release
[4605.46 → 4609.44] so they're getting that going John also asked
[4609.44 → 4612.78] me so very nicely, so this is the only reason
[4612.78 → 4616.00] that I'm going to oh but got him well whatever
[4616.00 → 4618.84] they're hiring them they're apparently hiring and I
[4618.84 → 4622.40] can't click this topic so get wrecked John that's
[4622.40 → 4626.46] what happens no that's what happens you ask me to
[4626.46 → 4628.54] shout something out, and you have a permission
[4628.54 → 4632.64] issue you get nothing that's how it works sorry
[4632.64 → 4636.26] John all right what what else are we
[4636.26 → 4637.68] supposed to be talking about okay let's talk
[4637.68 → 4640.34] about Logitech breaking these pop smart home
[4640.34 → 4644.18] buttons like freaking hate this stuff and this
[4644.18 → 4647.48] is why it was so important to the community that you
[4647.48 → 4650.30] know hex us not just be like yeah no you know yeah
[4650.30 → 4656.16] someday we'll, we'll have a local access okay because
[4656.16 → 4659.30] it's not okay, and they get it they 100% get it now but
[4659.30 → 4662.08] this is why people were butt hurt about it because anything
[4662.08 → 4665.38] that relies on a cloud service doesn't belong to you
[4665.38 → 4669.42] appropriately butt hurt Logitech is emailing pop smart
[4669.42 → 4673.44] home users to inform them that as of October 15th five
[4673.44 → 4677.68] days from now yikes all Logitech pop buttons and their
[4677.68 → 4682.62] associated hubs will lose all functionality last week I
[4682.62 → 4689.20] don't think so okay Logitech emailed users on September
[4689.20 → 4692.56] 29th announcing the shutdown giving users less than three
[4692.56 → 4696.68] weeks to do anything about it as compensation Logitech is
[4696.68 → 4701.66] offering a 15% discount coupon for select Logitech products in
[4701.66 → 4707.90] the US can you think they're they're a handyman just linked
[4707.90 → 4711.10] their doc site has the cruise thinking you could read
[4711.10 → 4722.22] it no I won't, they get nothing that's pretty good can you
[4722.22 → 4728.10] think of a more insulting solution remember we just talked
[4728.10 → 4730.80] about oh it's trash we just talked about how much of a
[4730.80 → 4735.00] discount right is probably still profitable do you remember
[4735.00 → 4740.08] that conversation so they are offering you an opportunity for
[4740.08 → 4744.32] them to profit on a new purchase after they just fucked you
[4744.32 → 4753.12] what is this select products you're not even going to let me buy any
[4753.12 → 4758.08] product I want and why is it only in the US like products I
[4758.08 → 4763.20] didn't actually realize this like if it's not profitable at 15% off
[4763.20 → 4769.36] dude what even is this can't buy that one like a 15% discount is not an
[4769.36 → 4775.84] apology that's like a that that's a that's a retention marketing strategy that
[4775.84 → 4783.20] that's like that's a mailing out coupon this is wild the pop system was
[4783.20 → 4788.22] launched in August 2016 to allow users to trigger smart home actions Phillips you
[4788.22 → 4795.74] Sonos etc with a starter kit priced at $100 and individual add-on buttons at $40 our
[4795.74 → 4800.86] discussion question is how do you think Logitech could have better handled this
[4800.86 → 4806.46] situation and what do you think is an appropriate end of life cycle for a piece
[4806.46 → 4812.30] of technology well yeah they could have handled this better and the proper way to
[4812.30 → 4816.38] handle this is to open source it that's the only proper way to handle it at this
[4816.38 → 4818.70] point
[4820.94 → 4825.90] and if you don't want to because you're still using that stuff maintain it yeah
[4828.54 → 4830.94] uh do you want to pick one sure
[4835.42 → 4839.58] ford do we do ford no I'm going to scroll up there's stuff up here right discussion on
[4839.58 → 4844.30] settlements you want to do that yeah we could do that sure discussion on settlements this
[4844.30 → 4851.74] week on the LTT Reddit a fan posted a story about how they received one dollar of credit
[4852.30 → 4858.78] for a parking app that had data leak back into 2021 in total the attorneys for the case were
[4858.78 → 4869.34] paid 6.2 million dollars seven class reps uh received 5k each and the rest of the 31 million dollars
[4869.34 → 4875.98] the credit was paid out in one dollar credits to the customers but wait there's more the credit is
[4875.98 → 4882.22] actually 25 cents that has to be used four times across four purchases
[4884.38 → 4889.74] the notice of this compensation also came with notes about data security improvements but ultimately
[4889.74 → 4896.30] stated that the company park mobile was never found liable for anything rather the settlement was
[4896.30 → 4901.42] reached to allow the company to continue focusing on providing excellent service for its customers
[4901.42 → 4907.90] um if people don't claim credits from or money or whatever it is from class action suits what
[4907.90 → 4913.90] what happens to the money I'll be honest with you, I don't know I don't know I assume the lawyers figure
[4913.90 → 4921.74] that out so I assume the lawyers helpful to the lawyers I literally do not know that though yeah
[4921.74 → 4930.62] not legal advice yeah discussion question believable is it even worth the company to give
[4930.62 → 4936.38] out one dollar to its customers what's the point if they claim they aren't liable uh well the point
[4936.38 → 4938.46] is that the lawyers get paid
[4941.74 → 4944.78] right like that's the point to the company though if the company's saying that they're not liable
[4945.34 → 4949.58] oh they just want the suit to end because they were spending so much money on legal yeah, yeah just it
[4949.58 → 4955.58] just ends it so I mean that's the point of any legal settlement is you either get so sick of
[4955.58 → 4962.46] litigating it and everyone's tired of it so you just reach a settlement or uh oh wanting to avoid
[4962.46 → 4967.98] a legal precedent is another reason that companies will often try to settle because if it goes to full
[4967.98 → 4975.90] trial then now it's legal uh precedent so now it could impact future cases whereas a settlement can't uh
[4975.90 → 4981.66] you might settle um and part of your condition for settling might be no admission of wrongdoing
[4981.66 → 4988.14] whereas if you don't settle, and again it goes to a full trial then you will have to admit wrongdoing
[4988.14 → 4993.42] so there 's's a lot of different reasons that you might want to settle for sure if you think
[4993.42 → 4999.26] it's going to end up costing you even more than you might want to settle, so there's at least like four
[4999.26 → 5001.90] reasons it's interesting that it's a credit for their own service
[5001.90 → 5008.06] I know and I'm assuming that they make more than 25 cents per transaction I would think so on parking
[5008.06 → 5014.78] so again yeah it's just a profitable discount it's not the fact that they make you spread a one
[5014.78 → 5023.02] dollar credit across four purchases is all the proof in the world that you could possibly
[5023.02 → 5031.50] need that the lawyers negotiating this on behalf of the people whose data was breached right
[5032.62 → 5036.78] do not care about any kind of
[5038.86 → 5044.78] data breach stuff like this is fascinating though because like this genuinely happens all the
[5044.78 → 5052.14] time and most of them don't go to class actions uh so that's yeah what does that even mean um
[5053.34 → 5059.90] like I used to check have I been pwned like all the time not to like to check my emails if I go pwned right
[5059.90 → 5065.58] but just to see what's going on and I like almost don't even bother anymore because it's just constant
[5069.50 → 5071.74] like look at these stats dude
[5071.74 → 5086.46] 15.11 billion pwned accounts nice sheesh I sort by breach date there we go oh look at all those
[5086.46 → 5094.06] from 2025 look at this scrollable list from 2025 like this stuff is just all the way does it like
[5094.06 → 5100.30] when does it there we go it stops there finally float plane chats having a field day with this uh
[5100.30 → 5107.66] donut 711 says I got charged a 35 cent transaction fee in this app on free parking the other day
[5107.66 → 5115.98] also uh this is great mass guy 842 says the lawyer should get paid an app credit too
[5116.78 → 5122.06] yeah they should have gotten 6.2 million dollars in parking credit right like if it's good enough
[5122.06 → 5127.02] if it's good enough for the people whose data was stolen why isn't it good enough for the lawyers
[5128.46 → 5134.14] right I understand the lawyers got to make money in these situations 6.2 million is crazy but then also
[5134.14 → 5138.54] like how many of them were there and how long did they work it and stuff like that because this said it
[5138.54 → 5148.22] happened back in 2021 right so like I don't know but then the payout is just so lame yeah and I get that
[5148.22 → 5155.42] stuff like this is supposed to be punitive right but hold on a second because they only actually paid
[5156.30 → 5166.22] whatever 6.2 million plus another 35 000 the rest of the 31 million was in one dollar credits that have
[5166.22 → 5173.98] to be used over four times parking so that was that I also have I guarantee you their margin
[5173.98 → 5181.34] on those so what does that what does that work out to so 31 million times four so we're talking
[5181.34 → 5186.38] about 124 million parking instances
[5189.82 → 5198.54] at 25 cents discount each they're going to make more than 6.2 million dollars if people actually
[5198.54 → 5205.98] redeem the 31 million so it's free real estate I'm yeah it really is i I really wonder what
[5205.98 → 5211.74] percentage of class action payouts are actually redeemed I suspect it's surprisingly low because
[5211.74 → 5219.90] most of the time it's um they're such low payouts yeah this is a comically low one I wouldn't bother
[5219.90 → 5225.74] for a dollar exactly but so what insane percentage of this okay here actually this is kind of an
[5225.74 → 5230.70] interesting conversation I'd love for you guys to kind of participate in this to give give me give
[5230.70 → 5238.78] me your line okay it's a dollar okay so whether it's an American you know uh bill or it's
[5238.78 → 5245.18] a Canadian coin you know what let's assume it's an American bill it's an American dollar okay let's start
[5245.18 → 5252.54] with an easy one it's stuck to the bottom of your shoe do you pick it up yeah okay of course you put it
[5252.54 → 5264.70] in your wallet yeah okay it is um it is you are walking down the sidewalk yep, and it is on the grass
[5264.70 → 5274.06] to the side of the sidewalk for sure okay for sure okay it is laying over actually no here's an easier
[5274.06 → 5280.86] one it's in a tree yeah, and you have to pull yourself up a branch in order to reach it definitely okay
[5280.86 → 5289.74] it's on a storm drain kind of hanging over one of the one of the grates, and it's wet yes okay
[5290.86 → 5293.90] it is on the floor of a bathroom
[5297.50 → 5302.62] it's American too right it escalated quickly it's an American dollar 40 cloth aren't they it's
[5302.62 → 5307.66] a dollar for the Canadian ones are plastic they're cotton so they're cotton they're cotton baby so I want
[5307.66 → 5311.02] you guys I want you guys I want you guys participating I want you guys participating i
[5311.02 → 5319.10] will leave the feces' dollar okay you what if it's just a urine dollar I would leave the urine dollar
[5319.10 → 5322.94] it's caught it's a cotton bill let's say it's not okay hold on oh we're going to find his line we're
[5322.94 → 5327.74] going to find his line we're going to find his line it's not near the urinal okay it's by it's by the door
[5327.74 → 5333.42] it's by the door I have seen what people do to bathrooms brother okay forget the bathroom forget the
[5333.42 → 5341.92] the bathroom okay, okay it is I'm leaving that one the heck alone okay it's on the floor of a
[5341.92 → 5352.42] commercial kitchen near where they cook man it varies like a lot depending on the kitchen church's
[5352.42 → 5364.88] chicken no I'll leave that one alone okay, okay hold on let me try to think I want to try
[5364.88 → 5369.00] and nail this down because the bathroom really did feel like a big escalation the bathroom is a pretty
[5369.00 → 5373.84] big I was kind of hope I was kind of hoping oh okay, okay here's my kitchen have you guys worked
[5373.84 → 5381.98] in commercial kitchens there's a reason why they have so many rats anyway uh okay it's not a public
[5381.98 → 5386.04] bathroom now it's the bathroom at your parents house oh yeah sure okay so that's fine yeah so
[5386.04 → 5392.64] that that's the that's the line then uh okay there's a there's an enormous gap between most people's
[5392.64 → 5401.50] uh home bathrooms let alone my parents and a public bathroom sure oh that's some bad experiences on some
[5401.50 → 5407.32] recent trips okay uh oh here's an interesting one okay so back to the one that was on the grass
[5407.32 → 5417.78] and there 's's a dog turd near it near it's fine as, but it's windy
[5417.78 → 5423.58] it's still probably fine so you don't know for sure that it didn't I think it's still probably okay
[5423.58 → 5428.88] it's downwind of the dog turd but not by much still probably okay if there's no visible mark
[5428.88 → 5435.02] so do you check it before you pick it up yeah but like as I'm walking up to it, I'm right yeah
[5435.02 → 5439.54] okay so you intend to pick it up, and you're gonna look for a skid mark on your dollar bill yeah
[5439.54 → 5444.32] okay if there's a skid mark that thing ain't moving okay got it got it okay I think i
[5444.32 → 5450.32] think we've found your line basically as long as it's clean I was expecting you to do more on the
[5450.32 → 5455.40] like having to do work to get to it and I was just gonna keep saying yeah i kind of figured I wasn't
[5455.40 → 5459.78] getting anywhere with that it just makes it a game and then it's fun it's not even about the
[5459.78 → 5464.88] dollar any more it's just okay there's a goal can I accomplish goal sure that's the interest so that
[5464.88 → 5471.90] so that whatever when it gets to like is this dollar a health risk it's like yeah okay how about
[5471.90 → 5480.82] this though so you are in a hurry okay, okay you're you are you're in enough of a hurry that you are that
[5480.82 → 5488.18] you are jogging oh okay it's on the other side of the street there are no cars no uh
[5488.18 → 5493.58] you're going this way and that way you're you're gonna you're going to go to the next intersection
[5493.58 → 5498.44] you're going to go right it's on the left side of the street it's there are hurries that are not that
[5498.44 → 5503.66] big of a hurry that I will jog for so it still kind of depends you're on your trip to your last trip to
[5503.66 → 5513.38] Germany no I don't get it okay, so there's the line anything to do with human or animal waste
[5513.38 → 5518.76] yep is a no-go yep and there are definitely kitchens there are definitely commercial
[5518.76 → 5522.62] kitchens where I'd pick it up off the ground okay there are also very disgusting commercial
[5522.62 → 5529.82] kitchens and then and then out of the way is fine as long as I was already playing Pokémon Go anyway
[5529.82 → 5538.58] yeah the point is to walk so yeah sure whatever I don't care got it okay, okay yeah um and I have
[5538.58 → 5544.32] done things where like there is an incredibly minor gain for this like incredibly long amount
[5544.32 → 5549.20] of walking that I could do and I'll just be like yeah sure oh man trick killer here says when I was a
[5549.20 → 5553.76] teenager we used to put dollar bills in the horse manure at the Minnesota state fair and then watch to
[5553.76 → 5562.16] see who picks it up absolutely deranged that is sociopathic that is just classic teenager I mean
[5562.16 → 5568.64] I mean look like this is coming from someone who literally had like horse sturdy fights in the
[5568.64 → 5575.30] riding ring with my siblings so like whatever like I'm not I'm not judging I mean that's the thing if
[5575.30 → 5580.74] one person more accurate teenager activity if one person throws one you have to throw it back I mean
[5580.74 → 5588.58] it's good and to be clear I'm talking like the dried out the dried out ones which is very different
[5588.58 → 5593.98] from it really is the fresh ones it really is very different Luca 103 says I'm sorry what
[5593.98 → 5600.82] tell me that you never lived on a farm without telling me you never lived on a farm poop made
[5600.82 → 5607.00] of grass is not that gross it doesn't smell that bad it doesn't like yeah they also do actually
[5607.00 → 5614.62] really turn into throwable balls they really do like it's yeah yeah they really do uh it's Austin blitz
[5614.62 → 5622.44] says it's poop though you get a little desensitized to it yeah you shovel enough of it like literally i
[5622.44 → 5631.38] probably have shovelled thousands of pounds of horse poo it's like yeah what yeah it's poop part of life
[5631.38 → 5641.46] you know um and like the difference between vegetarian animal poop and like carnivore animal poop
[5641.46 → 5650.56] a whole world of difference yeah um I don't know maybe that's the kind of thing i
[5650.56 → 5657.12] shouldn't admit but uh i i I'm in my I'm in my zero given phase should admit what that had a poop fight
[5657.12 → 5662.56] whatever i I don't know I think it's great someone's going to find a way to turn it into something I mean
[5662.56 → 5669.28] there's you know there's always there's always something I'm a scat man I'm a scat man no
[5669.28 → 5677.16] I have it you don't know that whoa do you please tell me you know what I'm talking about
[5677.16 → 5678.46] he's cool
[5678.46 → 5687.98] yeah rest in peace oh wait what really yeah oh, oh all right well that was a downer thanks Dan
[5687.98 → 5692.70] that sucks glad we brought you out of your focus zone to do that
[5692.70 → 5700.96] cool what do we want to talk about next ah yes the oh wow like a while ago okay
[5700.96 → 5708.52] Qualcomm acquires Arduino Qualcomm known for developing mobile chips such as the snapdragon
[5708.52 → 5714.26] series and many more has acquired microcontroller manufacturer Arduino for an undisclosed sum
[5714.26 → 5726.40] how are we feeling about this hold on okay i just I love the look on your face there uh Qualcomm
[5726.40 → 5732.30] states that by acquiring Arduino this will allow them to deliver a full stack edge platform which
[5732.30 → 5737.36] is a fancy way of saying local AI Jeff piercing posted a short five-minute video talking about this
[5737.36 → 5744.08] and some concerns like commitment to open source and education spaces which were like a huge thing
[5744.08 → 5748.72] with Arduino that's how people primarily talked about when they first showed up was the education
[5748.72 → 5756.88] spaces stuff well hey I mean Qualcomm is really well known for sorry I can't good luck I can't finish
[5756.88 → 5767.30] that sentence I mean here's the problem with something getting acquired for money by someone
[5767.30 → 5777.30] who expects a return on said money is that whatever money it was making now was clearly not enough for
[5777.30 → 5785.22] whoever was making money with it now so whoever's going to acquire it is often but not always often
[5785.22 → 5794.02] highly financially motivated to make it make more money yeah that's kind of the point private equity
[5794.02 → 5800.48] this isn't private equity but private equity I mean at an oh that's an interesting conversation at
[5800.48 → 5808.26] what point is at what point does a large enough conglomerate start to essentially function like
[5808.26 → 5813.36] private equity in terms of the impact that it has on the companies that it acquires I mean
[5813.36 → 5818.88] there's no I don't think that you know what's happened with Activision blizzard
[5818.88 → 5823.62] for Microsoft acquiring them would have been any different if private equity acquired them like
[5823.62 → 5825.78] I don't really I don't really see the difference at that point yeah
[5825.78 → 5832.78] well we'll see how that goes
[5832.78 → 5843.16] screwdriver sure why not Brusa and LTT screwdriver video Brusa posted a nine-minute video today
[5843.16 → 5848.78] talking about the development of the Ltd screwdriver wait that was Brusa I saw this in my feed i
[5848.78 → 5858.80] didn't realize it was Brusa huh cool uh yeah uh talking about everything from handle design to Linus
[5858.80 → 5865.96] spontaneously saying he wanted the screwdriver to be orange uh spontaneously saying that I don't know
[5865.96 → 5871.46] wasn't that the goal forever I don't know that's uh that's what that's what kyle says he says i
[5871.46 → 5877.96] couldn't I couldn't uh I couldn't contain my excitement i I haven't actually watched this so I have no idea
[5877.96 → 5883.56] what other uh what other things of course it was supposed to be orange uh I don't actually
[5883.56 → 5890.22] necessarily know that for sure because yeah the snap on one that I used before was orange
[5890.22 → 5896.32] and orange company colour orange and black part of our branding, but we also did an all-black screwdriver
[5896.32 → 5903.40] right from the very start i I literally do not remember it's possible he remembers this better than I do
[5903.40 → 5911.98] the screwdriver not having some orange on it would be weird the primary standard one not having some
[5911.98 → 5918.02] orange on it would be weird I really don't remember i have to i have to be completely honest with you, I wasn't
[5918.02 → 5924.96] involved at all so I have no idea uh but yeah that's that's awesome hypothetical world where would Ltd be
[5924.96 → 5933.88] today if there was no screwdriver exactly where it is probably but maybe a little smaller yeah maybe
[5933.88 → 5941.88] maybe a little smaller the screwdriver was a very most excellent um product launch for us and
[5941.88 → 5949.10] continues to sell extremely well on the store I think we're I think we're well over half a million
[5949.10 → 5955.70] screwdrivers now which is like I have had one interaction where someone had no idea what the
[5955.70 → 5960.10] channel was or anything but I was talking about what I do, and then they were like wait the screwdriver
[5960.10 → 5966.94] that has happened really so they just only know us by the screwdriver yeah well they I guess someone
[5966.94 → 5971.82] in their life probably knew the channel right and told them about the screwdriver, and they were like
[5971.82 → 5976.72] okay well it's very giftable tried out or got gifted or something I don't know what yeah um and then
[5976.72 → 5980.00] they liked the screwdriver a bunch so they knew the screwdriver, but they didn't they don't care
[5980.00 → 5986.00] about computers or anything right like fair enough yeah whatever I mean they were like nice screwdriver
[5986.00 → 5993.36] it's like okay cool they like it, they use it all the time sweet
[5993.36 → 6002.78] couldn't give the slightest crap about anything else going on but pretty stoked on the
[6002.78 → 6010.94] screwdriver nice yeah you know what I'm not stoked on ford ford ford is locking basic navigation and
[6010.94 → 6019.66] more behind a subscription who could have seen this coming could anyone possibly have seen this coming i
[6019.66 → 6027.02] mean ah dude I was uh i someone uh someone posted on the Subreddit that uh Chevy is announcing a new
[6027.02 → 6032.78] bolt and that surely Linus would be talking about this on wan show and I was like okay first it's a
[6032.78 → 6038.70] bolt not a volt yes that's the first thing I was going to say I never cared about the bolt
[6038.70 → 6046.38] the bolt was an entry-level EV which is like fine but what excited me was the volt the plug-in hybrid
[6046.38 → 6050.94] back when plug-in hybrids weren't trendy and cool yet and I took a bunch of flack for talking about how
[6050.94 → 6056.22] cool they were and now everyone knows they're cool they're so cool they really are cool so cool I loved
[6056.22 → 6065.18] the volt there is no new volt it's still bolt, or the new one is bolted whatever the point is two gm
[6065.18 → 6074.14] doesn't support android auto and CarPlay any more they've gone the Rivian tesla route and i i i i have to
[6074.14 → 6082.78] be honest man like i I still can think the cars are cool I'll be like yeah if this suits your needs i
[6082.78 → 6090.22] wouldn't judge you in any way for buying one, but you're going to have to pry my money from my cold dead
[6090.22 → 6098.38] hands before I buy a car that doesn't support me just plugging in my phone and using all my crap that
[6098.38 → 6103.90] I'm already logged into and all the data tracking that is already happening anyway because I need
[6103.90 → 6111.82] this in my pocket anyway I am not signing in to your additional platform and using your additional
[6111.82 → 6123.66] separate apps I am not going to do it I won't, so gm can make all the bolts and volts and Schultz and
[6123.66 → 6129.50] bolts I don't care they can make anything they want, and they will not get my money from me because
[6129.50 → 6139.10] they have made a decision that I fundamentally disagree with because it unlocks this bull because
[6139.10 → 6144.14] all of a sudden now you control the platform and all the other subscriptions that I already have in my
[6144.14 → 6152.94] life can't just be plugged into my car which I expect to just own once I pay that kind of money for it
[6154.30 → 6163.74] no I own my car I like my car a lot my car is great I got a new car oh what I'm daily driving
[6163.74 → 6168.46] a Prius no corolla different Toyota doesn't even know
[6171.18 → 6176.06] I have a new car what is it I don't know it's it's the one that we hooked up the comma AI
[6176.70 → 6181.74] uh self-driving so are you trying to like daily comma AI or something yeah so it's its going to be a
[6181.74 → 6186.30] really different kind of video for our channel I have no idea if people are going to be into it
[6186.86 → 6192.78] I don't know if it's going to cut together very well I don't know but i I get in the car we have
[6192.78 → 6199.26] like three or four webcams in there or if not webcams dash cams uh so we have two angles of me
[6200.06 → 6206.46] one that's like just me and one that's like me and the passenger we have an angle showing the comma AI and
[6206.46 → 6211.74] I think there might be one more angle I can't remember what it is uh and then uh we put a
[6211.74 → 6217.82] microphone on the passenger sunshade just like a little shotgun mic pointing at me and every time
[6217.82 → 6224.06] I get in the car I'm supposed to turn on the audio recording the video rolls automatically and then I'm
[6224.06 → 6229.42] just supposed to like if anything interesting happens I do like an audio mark for the editor and
[6229.42 → 6236.22] then i I talk about it, and we're going to cut it together and I daily drove a DIY self-driving i
[6236.22 → 6241.26] mean it's not really self-driving it's its an advanced driver's feature but I mean certain
[6241.26 → 6248.54] companies might call it self-driving so why can't I i I saw your car parked somewhere the other day
[6248.54 → 6256.70] yeah your actual car yeah yeah that one um and was genuinely confused because I was like where is he
[6256.70 → 6262.86] yeah and now this makes a lot actually a lot more sense because I was like I was the last person to
[6262.86 → 6268.46] leave the place and I was locking everything up and then yeah your car was there and I was like what
[6269.42 → 6273.74] okay I was actually concerned I like locked you inside oh yeah no I'm good yeah I'm driving I'm
[6273.74 → 6280.54] driving the corolla i uh i I like my car no I love my car it's great
[6280.54 → 6289.26] it doesn't it's not life-changing this is why I love my car so much yeah it's been paid off for so
[6289.26 → 6295.10] long and I get inside, and it's comfortable yeah the corolla's all right, and it gets me where I need
[6295.10 → 6299.98] to go yep oh no I don't have Google Maps oh my phone's sitting on the dash I suddenly have Google Maps
[6299.98 → 6309.18] wow crazy feature it turns out I'm still not really much of a car guy I like cool cars I don't like
[6309.18 → 6318.46] them um I just think it's a lot of money, and it is it's its it's a fun party trick like I don't
[6318.46 → 6326.38] think it's cheap to not want to spend like so decent nice new cars are so expensive I don't want
[6326.38 → 6331.66] to spend like 60 grand on a new version of my car how much is a 60 grand that doesn't even include
[6331.66 → 6338.78] your subscription a Reddit user on the Ltd Subreddit shared a photo of their truck requiring them to pay
[6338.78 → 6346.78] a 120 Canadian dollar a year add-on fee to get full use of their car's navigation system it's not
[6346.78 → 6351.82] the only subscription that you need to get full access to your ford truck's features their blue
[6351.82 → 6360.86] cruise hands-free highway driving assistance will cost you 500 us dollars a year or 2500 one time for a
[6360.86 → 6366.46] lifetime access which they indicate could actually be only seven years of the service
[6368.06 → 6372.30] the comment here who's this is David that's a dealbreaker ladies
[6374.30 → 6376.30] some other examples of car sub
[6377.98 → 6383.66] BMW has heated seats locked behind a subscription Mercedes has actual car performance locked behind
[6383.66 → 6390.30] a subscription okay I've talked about this one that one I actually don't necessarily mind as much
[6391.58 → 6400.46] because there can be wear and tear impacts on pushing hardware harder whether it's an electric
[6400.46 → 6406.70] whether it's a gas vehicle there could be an actual cost associated with unlocking that extra
[6406.70 → 6416.22] performance in terms of like warranty service over time that one could potentially maybe be justified
[6416.22 → 6423.42] heated seats that are just already there I object to far more also a navigation system that doesn't work
[6423.42 → 6428.94] is like what even is a car in current year that doesn't have a navigation system you've got to be kidding
[6428.94 → 6435.42] me anyway tesla has their media capabilities behind such a subscription Toyota has remote start on vehicles
[6435.42 → 6442.30] three years older or more on a subscription and a ton have over the air UI updates locked behind
[6442.30 → 6448.86] subscriptions gm stated huh, huh we've gm the one that remember I was just talking about how I'm not
[6448.86 → 6454.86] interested in their not having android auto or CarPlay uh gm stated that it earned more than two
[6455.50 → 6465.34] billion dollars in 2021 via in-car subscriptions and yeah i that's exactly why they don't do
[6465.34 → 6471.98] it is like they did in the volt any more dude the volt is like my per it was like the goldilocks zone what
[6471.98 → 6479.34] what is that car 2017 I think it's great sounds right it has a big enough screen that you
[6479.34 → 6486.62] can totally make out where you're going it supports android auto and CarPlay it never got any like ended
[6486.62 → 6493.74] production 2019 so yours being 2017 sounds pretty I think mine's a 2017 um it doesn't really get any
[6493.74 → 6500.06] OTA updates or anything, but it doesn't need them because I can plug my phone into it forever and have
[6500.06 → 6508.22] all the features I could possibly want people love these dude what 2019 Chevrolet Volt car and driver
[6508.22 → 6517.90] this is American prices used dude well yeah it's because it's like a god to your car it's awesome
[6517.90 → 6525.42] wicked no i I'm not even like that's that's cool I'm not even down talking it dude I took and I get it
[6525.42 → 6533.18] I took so much flack for that take back then like if it was a major factor in me just being like hey i
[6533.18 → 6537.42] don't think I'm gonna I don't think I'm going to push that hard into doing more car reviews on LTT
[6538.22 → 6547.82] because I took so much for being like this is a really great car did you throw it throw the car no the
[6552.46 → 6560.14] just damn did you start whipping it back at people or did you lose your youthfulness i just
[6560.14 → 6567.98] got I just got frustrated with them throwing feces at you what yes okay yeah
[6570.22 → 6577.66] doesn't taste good thought it was food oh no that never happened oh no
[6581.02 → 6588.06] yeah this sucks all of this sucks all of it sucks boo stop doing it discussion question in that same
[6588.06 → 6596.06] statement gm stated that uh I accidentally minimized this topic uh gm stated that customers are willing
[6596.06 → 6603.98] to spend 135 a month on average for the right mix of in-car products and services nope no I don't think
[6603.98 → 6610.14] I am my stuff it I'm not at all I will pay you nothing my subscription like my included with purchase
[6610.14 → 6617.90] subscriptions in my Tynan um expired last month and I don't even know what they were because
[6618.54 → 6626.78] to me a feature of a vehicle that is not just part of it and that requires a subscription doesn't exist
[6627.42 → 6632.46] so I have literally never used them because the last thing I want is to get used to using something
[6632.46 → 6638.54] that I know I'm going to have to pay monthly for later like nope the only problem my car's had in years
[6638.54 → 6643.98] happened somewhat recently there's some air got in the brake line still works perfectly fine just
[6643.98 → 6648.70] like should probably get it tuned up eventually um somebody with a trailer pulled out in front of me
[6648.70 → 6655.10] today when I was driving to work uh and at the red light their trailer brakes were not working and their
[6655.10 → 6659.66] trailer was brought blocking their brake lights so when they went to go stop I didn't realize there
[6659.66 → 6664.70] was a car in front of them as well so they stopped way earlier than I expected and I couldn't see their
[6664.70 → 6671.58] lights so I ended up slamming on my brakes in order to not hit them and uh that somehow fixed the air in
[6671.58 → 6686.62] the lines, so my car fixed itself thanks Honda okay sick I went to stop at the next light I was like wait what
[6686.62 → 6693.90] the heck it was awesome that is not okay yeah I'll go get it checked out, but it did actually fix itself
[6693.90 → 6699.10] so I don't know I don't know if like brake slamming just shocked the line and the air came out or
[6699.10 → 6709.42] something I don't know but I will get it checked out dude take hands are crazy affordable if you
[6709.42 → 6715.50] wait for the right deal these days whoa why is that so much cheaper than the one is it the turbo s part they
[6715.50 → 6723.58] have oh yes turbo s is the like top spec one um and is quite a bit more expensive but I mean I don't
[6723.58 → 6729.58] know here's one for 75 I know guys I'm taking it in I literally have an appointment from like uh that i
[6729.58 → 6735.58] planned like a week ago it's fine don't worry about it yeah my goodness um dude my car is depreciated so much
[6735.58 → 6745.34] it's fine though you bought a luxury electric car yeah what do you expect I expect to enjoy driving my
[6745.34 → 6748.86] luxury electric car except when I drive my corolla which honestly is kind of fine too
[6752.46 → 6758.78] dude the comma AI is really cool it's the more I drive it the more clear it is that it's
[6758.78 → 6767.82] really though only useful in a straight line like yeah it doesn't do anything other than really lane
[6767.82 → 6772.46] keep assist and auto start stop but to its credit I had a really cool experience with it this morning
[6773.10 → 6782.86] i um I was stopped in the left hand turning lane sorry coming down uh coming down highway 15 is that is
[6782.86 → 6788.62] that the one that that comes down from the trans Canada highway to the office area it's a highway 15
[6788.62 → 6792.62] I think so I think so yeah so I'm coming down highway 15 and then I'm turning left onto Fraser
[6792.62 → 6798.14] highway you know the one right okay, so there's your two lanes going straight and then there's your two
[6798.14 → 6804.06] turning lanes, so there's all that construction there for the sky train right now so I'm in the right
[6804.06 → 6808.62] most of the left turning lanes so if I was numbering them from left to right I'm in lane two
[6808.62 → 6814.94] okay, so there are two lights for the straight lanes those are kind of in front of me here
[6814.94 → 6818.46] and then there are two lights for the left turning lane there's one kind of here and then there's one
[6818.46 → 6824.30] like way over here, and so I was sitting there I was at the front and I was like what's going to happen
[6824.30 → 6832.22] when the straight green lights turn green is it going to rip me into the intersection because a beta feature
[6832.22 → 6836.06] I think it's still in beta actually have not checked, but it was in beta back when we did our first
[6836.06 → 6842.38] impressions um a feature that I think is in beta of the comma AI is a green and red light detection
[6843.02 → 6847.90] so it should theoretically automatically stop for a red light and start once the light turns green
[6849.34 → 6856.38] it didn't go when the straight greens went it didn't go I don't actually recall if it went when
[6856.38 → 6861.18] the left turning uh lights went I just have to check the footage but yeah I was pretty I was pretty
[6861.18 → 6866.78] impressed that is pretty good actually yeah that's quite a niche case however let's talk about yellow
[6866.78 → 6875.74] lights it slows down it seems to kind of treat them like caution, but it doesn't treat them like
[6876.78 → 6883.66] caution this will turn red maybe it treats them like caution maybe it will turn red maybe it could
[6883.66 → 6891.10] turn green again maybe it has location services and knows you're in bc uh it's a joke because bc drivers
[6891.82 → 6894.86] red means stop green means go yellow means go faster
[6897.50 → 6906.54] go faster but head on a swivel but go faster oh god yeah they just knew where you were
[6906.54 → 6911.10] they're trying to keep you fitting in with the locals yeah well
[6911.10 → 6921.58] Microsoft has promised more Xbox hardware is still on the way despite low sales numbers for
[6921.58 → 6930.06] their hardware and the canned Xbox handheld that um is rumoured to be because AMD required a guarantee
[6930.06 → 6937.82] that they would sell at least 10 million units um Microsoft has assured gamers that future first-party
[6937.82 → 6944.14] consoles and devices are still being designed engineered and built by Xbox they have pointed
[6944.14 → 6950.54] to the multi-year partnership that they entered with AMD earlier this year with that said it still
[6950.54 → 6956.78] looks like their main focus remains on game pass with rumours of a free ad supported tier of streaming
[6956.78 → 6962.14] only game pass on the horizon okay I can see from your face but hold on a second hold on a second
[6962.14 → 6967.50] uh okay we have a video coming soon about the state of Xbox that you should keep an eye out for i
[6967.50 → 6976.86] actually filmed my part of it today and I want to talk about ad supported free streaming only game
[6976.86 → 6984.86] game pass Luke would you like to translate that look on your face into words do you have words mostly
[6984.86 → 6992.62] sadness I think because you were a bit of an Xbox like boy yeah oh yeah original xbox 360 were
[6992.62 → 6998.78] a huge deal loved both of those consoles absolutely loved both those consoles just seeing either one of
[6998.78 → 7010.14] them immediately brings me joy like fantastic pieces of equipment um they really fell off the rails in a big way
[7010.86 → 7019.42] immediately after the 360 and I think never got it back um the unhappy face isn't this honestly it just
[7019.42 → 7021.26] feels like, and it's Microsoft again oh
[7021.26 → 7031.26] it feels like the same take that I have with windows which it's just been so long now of just
[7031.26 → 7039.18] junk the original Xbox and Xbox 360 were an amazing value prop came with incredible exclusives fantastic
[7039.18 → 7044.54] games fantastic hardware great experience, and then it just went and never came back
[7044.54 → 7052.54] so like one not making yeah what what what were the like bangers on the Xbox One
[7055.58 → 7058.78] I don't know when did gears hit was that three no that was 360 right
[7059.98 → 7066.54] no yeah Xbox One was Gears of War one right no oh no that was 360. The original gears war was
[7066.54 → 7072.62] either 360 or the original one oh no it wasn't original Xbox I don't think yeah so I'm pretty sure
[7072.62 → 7080.70] it's 360 then uh titan fall 2 says MAV okay it's multi-platform yeah yeah Gears of War was 360.
[7081.58 → 7086.38] uh halo 2 no, no no, no people are just naming stuff that was on the old versions
[7087.34 → 7091.50] halo 2 was playable in the original Xbox but primarily came out for the 360. It was really
[7091.50 → 7094.86] designed for the 360, but it was playable in the original Xbox if I remember correctly
[7095.50 → 7100.54] um, or maybe we just got our internet module thing late I don't know what was killer for Xbox One
[7100.54 → 7107.82] I'm trying to I'm trying to even remember the Xbox One did anybody care about the Xbox One
[7113.98 → 7125.10] gears 4 to 5 on the Xbox One halo 5 guardians um gears 5 Sforza no man fable 1 was like
[7125.10 → 7130.62] OG Xbox that wasn't that wasn't Xbox One fantastic game but old so like this is
[7132.86 → 7139.74] downhill when what year did the um yeah red dead 2 is cross-platform so that's not going to fly yeah
[7139.74 → 7145.42] it's not gonna work at all 2013 wow right around the time that windows started getting really terrible
[7145.42 → 7151.02] as well interesting I don't know what changed that I genuinely don't have this isn't I'm not I'm not actually
[7151.02 → 7154.86] alluding to anything it's just interesting that the timelines are similar when did Bill Gates step
[7154.86 → 7159.98] down way before that didn't he well yeah but I mean it takes a long time for the pipeline that's
[7159.98 → 7164.78] a fair but I think it was like way before that step down as CEO I'm just I'm just curious I'm not
[7164.78 → 7170.70] saying that he was like a great leader or whatever 2000 he stepped down it's kind of so that was way
[7170.70 → 7176.94] way way before yeah all right um what are you talking yeah okay so but my actual like
[7176.94 → 7181.66] sadness here wasn't about the Xbox hardware thing because in my opinion that's been dead for
[7183.82 → 7190.86] 12 years right so i already kind of moved on from Xbox hardware the thing that I like about Xbox
[7190.86 → 7197.34] hardware is the controllers now I would be really sad if they stopped making controllers, and it impacts
[7197.34 → 7202.14] my life literally not at all that they stopped making consoles despite being like as you said
[7202.14 → 7211.74] an Xbox boy right because they just completely lost me um which sucks yeah I'm trying to think of a
[7211.74 → 7220.94] good reason to game on an Xbox the cheap hardware was one not that then they've hiked the prices didn't
[7220.94 → 7226.70] they increase the price recently for the same console yeah when does that happen remember when mid-cycle
[7226.70 → 7231.02] consoles would maybe go down in price do you remember that go down, or you'd get like slim
[7231.02 → 7236.06] versions yeah or whatever they'd start coming with bundled games and like extra controllers like
[7236.06 → 7242.06] there'd be cool variants like value as translucent purple yeah yeah yeah that's crazy though
[7243.02 → 7250.14] who would do that with their screwdriver i what huh that's crazy that is crazy that's crazy that is
[7250.14 → 7259.66] crazy indeed um yeah so it's like the thing that I'm sad about here and I know I'm going to catch
[7259.66 → 7268.22] flack for this but the thing that I'm sad about here is the uh you can play the games for free with ads
[7270.62 → 7277.10] so you think that's bad that why do you think that's bad is a stepping stone in my opinion I mean is it
[7277.10 → 7283.42] to even more increasingly annoying things is it any different from what we already have in like
[7283.42 → 7288.94] microtransaction hell I think it's just progressive I mean the all I mean that it is basically just
[7288.94 → 7296.78] mobile gaming then this is my point oh I see okay so you're just like okay well ads will start being
[7296.78 → 7302.86] made with this in mind sorry games will start being I mean same deal unfortunately games will start being
[7302.86 → 7307.74] made with this in mind but like mobile games don't need to be as bad as they are they have the
[7307.74 → 7311.98] hardware they have the performance to make them better the ads don't on purpose the ad supported
[7311.98 → 7317.82] tier in mobile games though is just to get you going on to the microtransactions yeah and pc games are
[7317.82 → 7323.02] already made for microtransactions which is almost just like feels progressive it's like we skipped stage
[7323.02 → 7328.06] two cancer, and we went straight to stage four like I don't really I don't think we even skipped stage
[7328.06 → 7335.26] two or three I think we did them well when did we have ad supported games on pc like if that is
[7335.26 → 7341.02] you're saying like ads like I'm saying ad supported is like one of the stages we went through to
[7341.02 → 7348.78] get to in a few games are already games that have funding from ads yeah just in very alternative
[7348.78 → 7353.34] ways this is the most blatant because there's already been like paid billboard ads there's even
[7353.34 → 7357.18] been games that have the ads in them update over time okay tell me this
[7359.74 → 7368.78] if the idea is that the ad supports the streaming of the game then the game developer
[7368.78 → 7375.34] isn't really being incentivized in any way to put ads in the game itself, and it's a source of revenue
[7375.34 → 7379.90] that is completely separate from any kind of you don't know how the revenue sharing is happening
[7379.90 → 7387.58] that's true if your game gets more ad views oh so you're worried about a lot of things getting
[7387.58 → 7392.14] like super grind so what I was saying was that I'm worried about games being made with this in mind
[7392.14 → 7396.54] because the same thing happened with microtransactions when microtransactions came in
[7396.54 → 7403.50] cool cosmetics for accomplishing cool things went away yeah when microtransactions came in
[7403.50 → 7409.34] fun cheat codes went away I've had an intrusive thought you know how many loading zones there are in
[7409.34 → 7419.82] in Starfield this is my point ad break yeah so like just the fact that that mechanism in there
[7419.82 → 7422.62] is there concerns me um
[7425.26 → 7429.66] you understand streaming economy it can't just be free ads make sense to make it cheap that's
[7430.78 → 7436.46] fully understand that that's not the point at all the point is the perverse incentive that happens to
[7436.46 → 7442.70] the developers right because now they would be incentivized I'm assuming if your game plays way
[7442.70 → 7448.86] more ads than other people's games you're going to get more money I don't know when the ads play I don't
[7448.86 → 7453.26] know if it's during the game I don't know if it's during it can just be like in the middle of lining up
[7453.26 → 7458.94] a headshot no obviously so it has to be at some kind of natural break that you can't launch the
[7458.94 → 7464.06] game until you play a certain amount of ads or something right I don't know but I'm sure that
[7464.06 → 7467.74] starting with playing a bunch of ads exactly and then the game going
[7469.10 → 7476.30] will turn into this is playing a bunch of ads and then in between rounds could turn into
[7477.10 → 7487.34] whatever this is the sadness I see okay i I think gaming was better when you owned fewer games because
[7487.34 → 7489.50] you bought them
[7492.86 → 7500.38] I don't think having access to 700 games made my life better um when I had an Xbox and I had like
[7500.38 → 7506.22] five games it was great and that was totally fine and I bought them and there wasn't ads
[7506.22 → 7513.18] and there wasn't my good transactions, and it was fantastic I don't need infinite game on game
[7513.18 → 7519.02] pass for free but I have to watch ads I don't want that, but you can also afford regular game
[7519.02 → 7524.06] pass or just buying even when I couldn't, I preferred it I would just have fewer games like I said when i
[7524.06 → 7530.86] had just like a few games in an Xbox when my brother and I had to go do random chores and odd jobs around
[7530.86 → 7535.58] the neighbourhood to be able to afford a Super Nintendo even when like the n64 was out whatever
[7535.58 → 7538.78] I preferred the fewer games that I had that did not have the ads
[7538.78 → 7547.34] that is nostalgia talking it aggressively is not and I promise you that is not at all what's
[7547.34 → 7551.42] happening yeah you don't know this man I promise you that is not the case
[7553.10 → 7558.46] gaming boomer it's its genuinely not rose-tinted glasses looking at the past it is actually not that
[7558.46 → 7563.66] that is not the case whatsoever it is a degradation of gaming quality I loved
[7563.66 → 7569.58] uh that tons of games used to come with cheat codes that just made the game fun and silly i
[7570.46 → 7571.02] um
[7572.62 → 7579.58] loved games being more contained compartmentalized experiences I loved doing weird things in game
[7579.58 → 7585.02] and getting rewarded with like cool fancy stuff uh instead of most of the cool stuff being locked
[7585.02 → 7589.74] behind uh cosmetics that you buy in a store and if you don't think that's happening your nuts
[7589.74 → 7595.42] basically what Luke misses is the dopamine hit being because you did something yeah rather than
[7595.42 → 7600.94] the dopamine hit being because you paid for something yeah and even if you're like oh those
[7600.94 → 7607.18] mechanisms are still there they're not prioritized well yeah because it's way more profitable to
[7607.18 → 7612.54] prioritize giving you a dopamine hit for watching an ad or giving you a dopamine hit for paying money
[7612.54 → 7619.58] and it's such an incredibly powerful force and again if you don't think it is your probably just
[7619.58 → 7628.22] being manipulated sorry wow dropping truth bombs are you is what it is are you going to like
[7628.94 → 7635.82] you know warn them to get to an Evan zone before you drop truth bombs like that nope our discussion
[7635.82 → 7642.30] question here is actually kind of unrelated uh why is the steam deck considered such a huge success
[7642.30 → 7646.14] when it's rumoured to have sold somewhere in the neighbourhood of around 5 million units
[7647.02 → 7658.06] PS vita sold 10 to 15 million units we u sold about 13 million and both are considered to be historic bombs
[7658.06 → 7665.50] I actually think I have a good answer if you don't have one ready but I was curious to hear your take
[7665.50 → 7672.94] first I have a couple angles I'm going to go with expectations yeah the expectations for Linux gaming
[7672.94 → 7681.34] was that it was just never going to happen and I don't mean the optimists they thought Linux gaming had
[7681.34 → 7691.10] already happened and for them, it had but for the rest of the world for like you know my nephew
[7691.98 → 7701.10] it hadn't happened steam deck made that happen I guarantee you there are more people gaming on a steam deck
[7701.74 → 7711.18] right now than there were cumulatively ever before that on Linux like huge millions
[7711.34 → 7721.66] of units is incredible for like gaming on Linux um so what that, and it's also like
[7722.30 → 7733.02] it's also their first crack at it so it's a data point right whereas the Wii U and the PS vita they were data
[7733.02 → 7741.26] points that took a sales trend and went like this with it the steam deck is a sales trend that
[7741.26 → 7746.62] is at the very beginning that most external analysts thought would be a failure and that we
[7746.62 → 7751.58] think is probably going to go like this was a keyword right it's probably going to go like this
[7752.30 → 7760.38] so it's extremely exciting reason number two that the steam deck is considered a success is that the PS vita
[7760.38 → 7766.22] and the Wii U had very limited game libraries the Wii U did have some bangers
[7766.22 → 7772.86] but a lot of those bangers ended up selling big on the switch yeah they didn't end up selling big or
[7772.86 → 7779.26] on the Wii right like that's true they ended up selling on the consoles that were on either side of
[7779.26 → 7787.74] the Wii U um and yeah the PS vita had some bangers too but when you compare that to the steam deck
[7787.74 → 7795.58] valve's business model is to take 30 of every flipping game on steam and the steam deck is such an enabler of
[7795.58 → 7802.94] more hours spent gaming I guarantee you that the economics of the steam deck have worked out way
[7802.94 → 7809.50] better for valve than the PS vita or the Wii U ever did for Sony or for Nintendo, so those are my two main
[7809.50 → 7816.22] arguments is expectations and sort of future opportunity that is unlocked by the steam deck
[7816.22 → 7824.06] compared to those other two and also the ability to attach software to it is like I have
[7824.06 → 7830.86] literally bought games that I go I would never play this game except that I'm going to be stuck
[7830.86 → 7836.38] somewhere with only a handheld, and it's a perfect game to play on my handheld like I would never play
[7836.38 → 7842.30] vampire survivors on my desktop never I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't touch that game on my desktop not
[7842.30 → 7849.42] because it's a bad game probably have like 30 hours in it 35 hours in it, but it's all on my ally all of
[7849.42 → 7857.18] if it's just it's a mobile game for me, it's like I have 10 minutes yeah I'll just fire up vampire survivors
[7858.30 → 7864.06] yeah my main thing was expectations the other one was highly related to your other comment of like
[7864.06 → 7871.90] the future stuff because the 13 million Wii U sold were sold to a bunch of people that
[7876.30 → 7876.86] I don't know
[7879.50 → 7885.18] weren't super enthusiastic I guess I liked my Wii U a lot actually but most people that I knew that got
[7885.18 → 7892.30] one were like yeah it's kind of a Wii and your big thing was Mario Kart you played the crap out of
[7892.30 → 7897.26] Mario Kart 8 incredible if Mario Kart 8 didn't exist I don't think I would look back on the Wii U at
[7897.26 → 7901.26] nearly as positively yeah there were cool things about it, but really it was a Mario Kart 8 machine
[7901.26 → 7907.90] so if you really loved Mario Kart 8 the Wii U was a banger of a wicked yeah but if not more like that
[7907.90 → 7914.70] that cool uh four player dudes uh side scroller this is the reason why it would still look good to
[7914.70 → 7921.58] me because uh I think it was Mario brothers Wii U something or Mario brothers you that's what it was
[7921.58 → 7927.66] um you could play four characters playing the actual side scrolling game, and then you had one
[7927.66 → 7932.06] like kind of god mode character that could like to put down little platforms for them which ultimately
[7932.06 → 7937.42] turned into as someone was jumping you put down a platform in their way so that they smack into it and
[7937.42 → 7944.46] fall down you troll your friends um that was really fun the actual like unique controller tablet
[7944.46 → 7953.82] thing was actually really cool um but anyway the buyers of the switch the steam deck not the switch
[7953.82 → 7961.34] um are like really into it like I see a surprising amount of them on planes' oh yeah
[7961.34 → 7969.18] all the time oh yeah and there's that like wait what's that and maybe that person who asked that
[7969.18 → 7972.46] question isn't going to buy it now because it's like kind of two years old at this point whatever
[7972.46 → 7978.38] three and a half three and a half sure wow that's wow it's been a while um, but they might get interested
[7978.38 → 7983.10] in other handhelds they might wait for the next one whatever, but it's its that first one that doesn't
[7983.10 → 7990.06] necessarily sell as crazy as it could just because it wasn't as known, and it's quite a daring piece of
[7990.06 → 7997.34] technology to put out there like my goodness especially with um steam OS but the I suspect the next one will
[7997.34 → 8003.58] do even better I heard back from Dave um
[8003.58 → 8005.58] um
[8006.86 → 8014.54] on the holidays sorry so uh yeah sorry Mr calls we do have time to try between Black Friday and boxing
[8014.54 → 8019.42] day plan was to hold out until the holiday promotions are over to minimize stacking discounted
[8019.42 → 8028.78] cards on additional discounted offers yes so that was my understanding too, but apparently we ran it now
[8028.78 → 8038.06] anyway we'll be tracking redemptions to see how customers spend the cards over time okay uh well
[8039.26 → 8049.18] hope you wanted a cash injection nope I'm okay right now I was uh well I don't know what to say that all
[8049.18 → 8055.74] i all I managed to do today was take a 10 bite out of what was going to be the Black Friday cash injection
[8055.74 → 8061.42] yeah oh whatever you know what merry Christmas
[8064.38 → 8067.98] yeah they'll be fine they'll be all right they already got everything who cares
[8069.26 → 8078.86] um uh speaking of not having everything South Korean government loses 858 terabytes of data and fire
[8078.86 → 8088.54] whoa a battery fire on September 26th consisted of 384 battery packs resulted in the destruction of 96
[8088.54 → 8094.86] government computer systems while 95 of those systems did have some form of backup one system
[8094.86 → 8100.38] known as the g drive g meaning government not google reportedly couldn't
[8100.38 → 8110.70] okay have a backup system due to its large capacity I couldn't is a big word that's not true uh rendering
[8110.70 → 8118.22] all 858 terabytes completely gone g drive was used by staff to store documents and allocated 30 gigabytes
[8118.22 → 8123.74] of space per public official so it's all their like personal stuff no that's brutal the ministry of the
[8123.74 → 8130.06] interior and safety originally issued guidelines that all work materials should be stored on the g drive
[8130.38 → 8138.94] that's nutting as for the other 95 computers that did have backups only 62 percent were backed up daily
[8138.94 → 8144.38] with the remaining 38 backed up monthly that's a big jump uh leaving additional data loss concerns
[8144.94 → 8152.86] oh, so there's more than 858 terabytes lost nice uh wow overall the fire impacted government email
[8152.86 → 8160.06] online postal services petition services and the national 119 emergency service I don't actually know
[8160.06 → 8166.94] why everyone uses different ones um 119 feels very inspired by 911
[8168.54 → 8174.94] that's a very that's a very North America centric point of view how do you know 911 wasn't inspired by 119
[8174.94 → 8182.78] telephone prove it who made telephone it was probably the way that I described I can't guarantee that
[8182.78 → 8193.10] but I'm just guessing what emergency services number was first okay AI go
[8194.06 → 8202.70] 999 wow wrecked sure why don't we all just use that absolutely wrecked sure well okay that doesn't
[8202.70 → 8205.98] actually that doesn't prove any point that doesn't prove any point that doesn't prove any point you're
[8206.94 → 8210.62] you're talking like you're sounding like someone who was wrecked that doesn't prove it sounds like
[8210.62 → 8218.38] someone who doesn't know that doesn't point prove any point at all it proves that 9-1-1 is not the right
[8218.38 → 8227.02] one sure so 9-1-1 should be 9-9-9 then sure and 1-1-9 should just also be 9-9-9 sure why does it change
[8227.02 → 8234.22] 9-9-9 was a bad first choice yeah i kind of think you should change it at least once 9-9-9 was for rotary
[8234.22 → 8239.34] phones oh that's interesting, but that would take too long yeah that would take a really long time
[8241.10 → 8247.98] uh yeah okay I mean some kids still could debate 1-1-9 versus 9-1-1 no I don't think I need to
[8249.34 → 8253.34] uh anyway yeah moving on so it was more than 858 terabytes that they lost
[8253.34 → 8258.14] um since the incident one employee involved in the data recovery process has
[8260.46 → 8266.46] taken on a live yeah themselves four other individuals have been arrested and are actively
[8266.46 → 8271.42] being investigated on whether professional negligence maybe have contributed to the fire honestly
[8271.42 → 8277.10] blaming the employees at this point is the least based thing that you could possibly do I think it's
[8277.10 → 8283.18] time to just own the responsibility that you didn't feel like spending another you know 100 grand
[8283.34 → 8289.74] on another petabyte of data to have a second copy of this stuff and uh wow
[8291.42 → 8295.82] the South Korean government has reported a recovery rate of only 17.8 percent
[8296.46 → 8301.74] oh with a full recovery expected to take a month how are they possibly hoping to get a full recovery
[8301.74 → 8306.22] of this if it burned down and there wasn't a backup that just sounds like nonsense
[8306.22 → 8313.34] I mean I'll be honest with you maybe they mean no there's no way as someone they mean the services
[8313.34 → 8320.70] as someone who has lost data from a petabyte project it was a very conscious decision I made the decision
[8320.70 → 8329.74] fully understanding that I wasn't backing up this data to not back it up based on cost that was the only
[8329.74 → 8336.22] reason that we didn't back it up because that data was not essential so it was all archived projects
[8337.02 → 8343.98] and I didn't feel like spending money on it so yeah to hear anything other than we didn't back this up
[8343.98 → 8350.70] because we didn't feel like spending money on it is horsed and I throw it at you, I haven't
[8350.70 → 8357.18] I have no idea on the legitimacy of this but it's mullets in full point chat said the fire also
[8357.18 → 8361.66] happened on the same day investigation was supposed to start on corruption related things oh
[8364.62 → 8370.54] okay so there's more to it maybe i I don't know that's not from our notes I have no idea
[8370.54 → 8377.34] but if you know maybe nine says they did have two copies on the same system in the same data centre
[8377.34 → 8380.86] you knew what I meant nine
[8384.86 → 8389.18] all right are we talking about wait have we finished sponsors yet thing no
[8390.86 → 8396.86] uh no we have one topic left so we should probably do those right now yeah I won't and then we can
[8396.86 → 8404.38] talk about the steam machine after that oh okay once I get it back together YouTube no longer permanent
[8404.38 → 8409.82] people it used to be that YouTube took steps wait shouldn't we do the sponsors I thought you wanted
[8409.82 → 8414.46] to do a topic we have to do the sponsors so that we have one topic left after that they'll have after
[8414.46 → 8421.50] dark after that so we do sponsors and then after dark yeah okay after dark is great people love after
[8421.50 → 8426.94] dark they'll stay for after okay sure it's the best part of the show yeah i just force my way
[8426.94 → 8436.38] through the rest of it I only like after dark pretty much I'm kidding we have to wade through the topic
[8436.38 → 8443.26] so we can get to the real juice uh anyway so it used to be that YouTube would Perm ban you and then
[8443.26 → 8449.10] you were Perm banned, and they took steps to prevent you from creating a new account well now YouTube
[8449.10 → 8455.10] believes in second chances our long-held approach of enforcing lifetime terminations can be difficult
[8455.10 → 8461.34] for creators uh blah blah blah blah blah appeals starting today some previously terminated creators
[8461.34 → 8470.54] will have the opportunity to request a new YouTube channel this is a fresh start you can re-upload
[8470.54 → 8476.62] any of your prior videos that are within our community guidelines how will you decide who gets a new
[8476.62 → 8481.50] channel oh god man there's some stuff that just like heavy there's people that really should not
[8481.50 → 8487.26] be let back on the platform whether the creator committed particularly severe or persistent violations
[8487.26 → 8491.02] whether the creators on or off platform activity harmed or may continue to harm the YouTube community
[8491.82 → 8499.26] like channels that endanger kids safety that's um that's good um not everybody seems to be that
[8499.26 → 8505.58] concerned with uh holding accountable people who uh endanger kids safety there was there are some files i
[8505.58 → 8511.26] think that uh that there's probably some people are hoping would burn down in a government data centre
[8511.26 → 8517.02] fire but uh I don't know at some point yeah we should probably release those files all of them every
[8517.02 → 8524.46] single part should release all of them yeah um don't leave anything out what about monetization you can apply
[8524.46 → 8534.06] for it okay man I'm I'm having real mixed feelings on this I feel like having this be like at our
[8534.06 → 8539.66] discretion maybe some people will maybe be allowed is a huge can of worms and I just don't understand why
[8539.66 → 8545.34] they would open it up because if they don't let someone back they're making like uh they're making
[8545.34 → 8550.46] because everything's everything's polarized now oh yeah if they don't let someone back they are making a
[8550.46 → 8555.98] a specific judgment about that specific individual and if they do allow someone back they're making
[8555.98 → 8562.06] a specific judgment about that specific individual like there was this there one of the first channels
[8562.06 → 8567.34] that I was aware of being banned I probably wasn't the first channel to ever be banned, but it was a
[8567.34 → 8573.02] big channel and it's getting banned was like kind of big deal was this channel called David's farm
[8573.82 → 8579.90] and it was kind of a lot of what it sounds like just like uh you know it was one a very early like
[8579.90 → 8590.54] farming YouTube channel, but there was like very unsafe very disgusting animal cruelty stuff that
[8590.54 → 8597.10] happened oh and just egregious violations of you know anything that would be considered remotely
[8597.10 → 8605.98] acceptable for upload to YouTube and I'm sitting here going like would they let someone who content
[8605.98 → 8613.34] warning extremely graphic description incoming so mute your mic for a second and I'm going to go like
[8613.34 → 8621.74] this when it's safe um mute your mic your headphones yeah like this is a channel that took a live pig
[8622.30 → 8628.14] pinned it down and chainsawed it in half while alive safe now
[8628.14 → 8642.70] um why that that is a person that clearly is disturbed in the head um and does not need to share anything
[8642.70 → 8649.26] they have to say with anybody sorry that I'm standing by that yeah um
[8649.26 → 8658.94] um you know so if I see something like that come back I'm sitting here going no lifetime ban was the
[8658.94 → 8667.10] right kind of ban you know i I don't know dude I don't like that is that like that's just it's monstrous
[8667.10 → 8675.42] you know um yeah there's a lot of people saying that it has to do with uh Trump's ban
[8677.18 → 8684.54] so oh, so this is just a policy to have something to point at when they
[8686.86 → 8691.90] violate what previously would have been the policy and reinstate an account you think it's that simple
[8691.90 → 8697.66] they're just it might be i just I've seen some comments about this i I have no idea where's the
[8697.66 → 8703.50] my thing we don't have any notes on that I don't know anything about it, I thought Trump's ban was
[8703.50 → 8710.30] overturned like quite a while ago but like you said maybe it's just something to point to now no idea
[8711.18 → 8716.38] interesting I honestly didn't even know he was banned off YouTube oh yeah yeah it was after the um
[8716.38 → 8723.34] January 16th yeah oh yeah that makes sense yeah, but he was reinstated in 2023 yeah I don't know so
[8726.86 → 8733.82] who knows yeah moon pies what a time to be alive
[8736.62 → 8741.34] it's going to be after dark in a minute let's get through that sounds like two-minute papers I mean
[8741.34 → 8750.38] what a paper time to be alive I love that man what do you want this yeah from after the

[8909.42 → 8918.86] oh yeah uh show us it's not quite done I'll bring it over right now okay all right just make sure it
[8918.86 → 8924.94] still works I mean why don't you just point your camera I heard him do a little squeak and
[8924.94 → 8931.26] I knew he got it I knew something happened it was earlier in the show I was like the dopamine squeak yes
[8931.26 → 8937.18] exactly I heard it and I was like oh we're getting something good I don't know what exactly like i
[8937.18 → 8939.82] don't know if the maybe he just got the light to turn on or something but
[8942.38 → 8950.38] is it boot I don't know no screen I guess yeah okay well we'll see what happens I guess want to
[8950.38 → 8956.62] give me your HDMI cable sure dude I'm so stoked I don't want to throw my bottle there we go actually
[8956.62 → 8963.82] work it's been intermittent somebody's oh my power cable's not here any more crunched a bunch of cables
[8963.82 → 8969.66] in their maybe when they tried to reassemble it I don't know what you're talking about so he's
[8969.66 → 8976.38] blaming me can you believe he's blaming me I don't think he was oh he was Dan you were blaming me right
[8976.38 → 8984.62] no I don't know might have been um sent from factory like that see god British humour
[8986.30 → 8991.58] actually it's the funniest i you know i I mean it wasn't in your position for so many years i just
[8991.58 → 8999.42] assumed he meant somebody else no he wouldn't take shots at some random I mean it was a blameless
[8999.42 → 9006.06] accusation see you can tell from his tone you can tell from his tone how blameful it is I've seen
[9006.06 → 9012.22] enough insides of things that just blame a general person, and then they can be guilty to see he blamed the general
[9015.18 → 9021.26] oh I wonder if the front button is actually make sure not to dock someone with pulling up the sign in
[9023.02 → 9025.34] what I mean
[9028.30 → 9034.06] i think the sign in is probably going to be a username worst case scenario I think we're probably
[9034.06 → 9039.42] going to be okay watch it is like full first and last name of a valve employee no I know right
[9041.18 → 9042.46] I mean it'd be pretty funny
[9044.62 → 9050.14] there's no way they haven't even noticed have they gave no rule oh hey look it glows
[9050.94 → 9056.70] yeah we're going to bring it over here why is it over here we want to put it on the screen, so people can see
[9056.70 → 9063.66] well in fairness to him the first thing I said was Dan why don't we just do it over there so uh
[9063.66 → 9068.70] uh oh did you uh did you take away the power cable he needs the power can I have that please
[9068.70 → 9076.14] okay
[9080.86 → 9081.90] Dan you hit the mic
[9085.02 → 9088.14] god some people's kids man
[9088.14 → 9094.38] okay uh should we move the banner so they can see like yeah yeah yeah or like
[9094.94 → 9099.34] hold on he just sat down we don't need it no, no we don't can is that opaque or is it transparent
[9099.34 → 9103.66] you know what just add a bit of a bit more translucency that way people's merge messages can still show
[9103.66 → 9110.62] yes please thank you hey there we go wow
[9110.62 → 9111.26] oh
[9113.98 → 9116.06] did you uh what did you push it correctly
[9118.06 → 9119.26] oh what the heck
[9121.10 → 9125.26] yeah who broke it now smart guy as far as I can tell Linus had it back for like
[9125.26 → 9131.58] a minute and just destroyed everything no way that was no that sounds I destroyed nothing that sounds
[9131.58 → 9139.42] more accurate no I destroyed nothing that sounds more accurate to me stop oh I'm just not sure if this
[9139.42 → 9146.78] fan's going to be able to spin uh the mount on it is broken yeah it's really temperamental uh oh okay
[9148.06 → 9150.22] so it broke
[9153.10 → 9159.26] it broke yeah I think maybe it's broken I want to display oh that was barely in there
[9160.06 → 9165.18] it was in there that was barely in there it was totally in there you don't have to plug things in
[9165.18 → 9171.42] I know I was our tactics plug in the freaking cable it was plugged in dude he pulled it out with like
[9172.38 → 9181.02] one hundredth of a pound of force oh is it off again no it just hasn't turned on in a while i
[9181.02 → 9189.10] plugged it in no you did I did you did not at all you did not I did they can't see if it was not
[9189.10 → 9194.14] properly plugged in it was plugged in at all you know what it's Dan what do you think I don't know
[9194.14 → 9200.70] whoever plugged it in last time probably didn't it was on here like this I probably plugged it in
[9200.70 → 9207.42] until it hit this it was very difficult to plug in i think that I think that's probably what
[9207.42 → 9211.02] happened is I plugged it in, and it felt like it moved, and then it hit this thing right here because
[9211.02 → 9215.58] it hangs down a little bit yeah that makes sense that's because the the the power cable has a bit of
[9215.58 → 9221.58] an I didn't plug it in box do we have an is there an output at all checking my laptop uh that's what
[9221.58 → 9227.18] it was before oh yeah that seems to be yeah that's the last frame it had I have
[9229.26 → 9234.70] 800 by 600. oh, okay so that's probably a bios splash screen then let me
[9235.98 → 9240.30] so your laptop you took the storage drive out of it Dan how the hell are we supposed to boot it
[9240.86 → 9245.34] well the fact that it turned on I think is good enough um I'll bring that over back in one sec
[9245.82 → 9249.34] let's just make sure that we can get oh well I mean yeah we wanted to see what
[9249.34 → 9250.86] it that was why we were going to show the screen
[9251.82 → 9257.34] I didn't even know it was going to work like five minutes ago that's fair I am happy we got the ring
[9261.74 → 9266.62] yeah he wants it to not work it's better for camera no I want it to work oh yes sorry i
[9266.62 → 9271.66] forgot that what's in our script you know fail for content or whatever yeah that's all we do he did
[9271.66 → 9276.22] not a principle he did mean to pull it properly core tenant, but he just knew the views
[9280.14 → 9287.42] what did he do he dropped the drive into directly onto the motherboard that's amazing
[9287.42 → 9298.06] you can't make this stuff up dude it's just it's a padded drive it's cushioned oh my goodness
[9301.18 → 9304.30] this man's an icon oh man
[9306.38 → 9310.86] all right we'll see how this goes all right well maybe it won't, we can do it yeah
[9310.86 → 9317.26] that yeah we can, he was going to say we can start merch messages while we tinker around with this
[9319.98 → 9323.50] uh sure yeah let's see Dan have you been doing merch messages at all
[9324.22 → 9329.02] well we have uh had like 300 so I've been trying
[9329.74 → 9331.42] um oh my god this is

[9333.98 → 9338.70] dude this is we're good this guy bought 300 in gift cards
[9343.58 → 9346.38] is anybody buying anything other than gift cards
[9347.74 → 9353.02] some people said they might buy stuff oh my god someone bought the gift card
[9353.58 → 9355.58] and super discounted swim trunks
[9356.86 → 9357.66] and a pin
[9358.86 → 9359.66] well the pin was free
[9359.66 → 9367.98] we had a deal you guys you're going to buy profitable stuff
[9369.98 → 9374.22] oh my god so many people are buying like 250 gift cards or like
[9374.86 → 9381.90] multiple hundred dollar gift cards what is this order 242 dollars a hundred
[9381.90 → 9387.50] dollar freaking gift card okay no you bought a couple scribe drivers thank you Jacob
[9387.50 → 9390.30] for being a team player
[9392.62 → 9397.82] so I'm going to jump in the incoming and help Dan okay uh, uh I mean uh
[9398.86 → 9399.58] Dan left
[9400.94 → 9405.10] he just left he was there, and he left I might have too Luke we're on our own now
[9406.22 → 9414.14] we could do it we're fine oh well that's the steam machine so much for that um okay so should I just
[9414.14 → 9418.30] do curated ones on my own I can read it to you if you want no I'll do it I'll do it
[9419.58 → 9427.02] Joseph b writes what ho when showers I managed to see the Joseph musical in the summer it was great
[9427.02 → 9434.30] and brought back memories just wondering what makes it special to Linus may I suggest pc build guide the
[9434.30 → 9441.74] musical you know with Riley's talents i that could actually be pretty great some of those
[9441.74 → 9446.30] sponsors I feel like I would actually really enjoy it dude the um that's over your power button
[9446.30 → 9454.06] just a heads-up the whatever the most recent one was uh oh on the underwater um yes
[9454.06 → 9459.98] that one the ad spot on there is hilarious I think I watched it twice or three times yep oh dude amazing
[9459.98 → 9465.10] um especially a lot of people from the thumbnail by the way might have assumed that was another like
[9465.10 → 9469.58] pool cleaner or something yeah we're working on updating the thumbnail I think we're going to
[9469.58 → 9475.98] change the thing in my hand to a boom box so then it seems like a good idea a little less obviously a
[9475.98 → 9482.86] product the reason we used that Bluetooth speaker was just because it seemed like so a tied into
[9483.66 → 9489.34] the initial research I did try to find a solution where it was just a bunch of stupid Bluetooth
[9489.34 → 9493.10] speakers that advertise themselves as being waterproof but actually what they meant was
[9494.06 → 9499.02] can get splashed on a little bit not like under so I searched for underwater speaker and I ended up
[9499.02 → 9503.02] with a bunch of stupid Bluetooth speakers so it was kind of it was kind of supposed to tie in with that
[9503.02 → 9510.14] and also it just clearly looks like a speaker you know to the modern audience but I think that the
[9510.14 → 9516.78] boom but to your point I think it looks sponsored, but it's not it's super I understood it wasn't which
[9516.78 → 9521.98] is why I clicked on it, but it immediately looked very yeah so I think if we change it to a boom box
[9521.98 → 9527.74] above the water then that will sell it a little bit better as what it is um anyway what's special
[9527.74 → 9533.34] about it for me is I think it was one of the first musicals I ever saw I went with my auntie, and it was
[9533.34 → 9539.58] just it was just such a great show it was such a was such a magic awesome experience it is set off
[9539.58 → 9547.26] what turned out to be a lifelong love of musical theatre live theatre in general um and Donnie is
[9547.26 → 9555.18] just such an incredible star uh it was when Donny Osmond was playing Joseph um and so yeah when I saw
[9555.18 → 9561.98] it most recently with him playing pharaoh it was such a cool like full circle moment, and it was just magic
[9561.98 → 9567.98] man it's its an it's a great show it's just pure fun it doesn't oh my god it booted up
[9570.06 → 9574.46] you want to show the people uh yeah I would like to do you want to use Luke's cam or my cam rather
[9577.58 → 9585.10] uh Dan can you push the button push the button I did oh, oh is there pastor well no yeah I mean you'll
[9585.10 → 9589.66] have to move the camera Dan yeah because it's not pointed at the I thought it was yeah he's he's
[9589.66 → 9593.98] tethered with headphones this is hilarious also your producer cam thing is up right just go to the
[9593.98 → 9601.02] widen you can only do two things at a time okay there you go nailed it perfection
[9603.02 → 9609.82] okay just you're good Dan that's fine it's good enough we don't have a keyboard though Dan oh my
[9609.82 → 9617.66] god does it need something well I mean i yeah it depends if we've, and he's gone um cool good
[9617.66 → 9626.22] merch message I'm going to archive it now uh Adam r writes greetings DLL it is genuinely hard to pitch
[9626.22 → 9631.82] slash explain YouTuber merch and there isn't really a better term have you considered brand
[9631.82 → 9639.50] names for your clothing outside Ltd store uh Linus textiles that one's free uh we are going to
[9639.50 → 9644.86] transition to using more creator warehouse branding for like our blank products with the idea being that
[9644.86 → 9653.10] eventually maybe other creators would use our blanks as well beyond that I think we've discussed
[9653.10 → 9662.62] switching over to Ltd rather than Linus um and then Ltd store could still just work and we just kind
[9662.62 → 9667.66] of move away from the piousness like our old stealth hoodie for instance was like a black on black so it
[9667.66 → 9673.58] was still stealthy, but it just had like Linus tech tips and giant text down the arm we very rarely put my
[9673.58 → 9682.78] name on anything anymore and that's that's highly intentional um Dan is doing things over there so
[9682.78 → 9690.06] I'm just going to switch over to that camera but yes it has occurred to us but right now our overall sales
[9690.06 → 9696.54] volumes are so relatively low that splitting out and creating a new product line with a different brand
[9696.54 → 9701.50] I feel like all it would really serve to do is split our run rate and I don't see how we could
[9702.62 → 9712.38] how we could justify it we're still honestly speaking are not that good at selling outside promoting it
[9712.38 → 9719.34] through our like YouTube channels we still have a lot to learn about marketing without leaning on the
[9719.34 → 9727.34] YouTube channels as a crutch uh unique username says Linus that was the opposite of stealthy
[9727.34 → 9733.66] that was a shiny Linus cringe it wasn't shiny it was like it was like matte black on black
[9735.02 → 9740.62] yes I agree it's too much and that's why we don't do it anymore but I really don't think it was shiny
[9740.62 → 9750.38] that i I don't think I can agree with that sorry Luke and Linus writes Gabriel you've talked about
[9750.38 → 9758.38] making sandals in the past have you thought about making boots or for clothing work in the oil and gas
[9758.38 → 9767.50] industry and for is required PS play payday three uh you mean like fire-resistant yeah flame yeah so we
[9767.50 → 9777.10] looked at doing flame retardant like uh either like the base material itself or with coatings on the
[9777.10 → 9786.54] workshop jacket and ultimately um I forget whether it was due to like the chemical nature or we really
[9786.54 → 9792.70] liked the material we were using, and it just wasn't or if it was a certification thing we're very low
[9792.70 → 9801.18] volume like that's the thing to um to kind of remember always is that we are you know a big
[9801.90 → 9809.42] YouTuber organization but a little bitty company in the grand scheme of things like we are
[9809.42 → 9818.54] ants under which the giant boots of companies like nestle descend upon and crush like we're we're not a
[9818.54 → 9825.50] huge player in the grand scheme of things so um like this is impacting our ability to do cables for
[9825.50 → 9833.34] instance our USB cables are coming but certain display cables not going to name any names have just
[9835.82 → 9845.82] unbelievable fees um associated with every single skew at every single length that could prevent us from
[9845.82 → 9854.30] being able to make that type of display cable at all um because we just don't do that kind of volume so
[9857.10 → 9866.86] no plans for fire-resistant clothing in the near future as for boots very unlikely as well doing
[9866.86 → 9877.90] boots requires different moulds for every single size and I mean i I feel like you could
[9877.90 → 9882.46] probably go to like a Chinese boot factory or something like that, and they'd be able to do the
[9882.46 → 9889.18] moulds for you for a fraction of what you'd be able to do somewhere else but between tariffs and between
[9890.30 → 9895.10] it being very challenging to control the quality of a product like that I just don't really see what we'd be
[9895.10 → 9902.14] adding to the boot category if that situation ever changes if we find a really outstanding you know
[9902.14 → 9909.26] factory, and we find a really outstanding reason for our boots to exist never say never, but there are
[9909.26 → 9913.42] absolutely no plans for the near future also duly noted on the payday three recommendation
[9913.42 → 9926.46] oh wow um I can do a couple more if you want no idea how to read this but here's a merch message from
[9927.66 → 9937.58] this yeah love from China do you think that it is ethically defensible for apple to apply double standards
[9937.58 → 9942.54] when it comes to trading profit for surrendering iCloud servers to our government
[9943.66 → 9951.58] what would you do if you were in our situation uh no I don't think it's defensible at all I mean this is one of
[9951.58 → 9960.94] the things that drive me so nuts about apple, and it's one of the things that apple users flipping hate when I talk about
[9960.94 → 9969.34] because there is no defence of this you can't get on stage and talk about how important user privacy is to you
[9969.98 → 9975.74] you can't beat your chest and talk about how uncompromising you are about user privacy
[9978.22 → 9985.34] when you have user data in data centres that the Chinese government has unlimited access to
[9985.34 → 9994.54] I'm sorry, but you don't get to do that and yeah the Chinese government would probably just
[9994.54 → 10002.06] lock apple out of the Chinese market if they refused to surrender that access, but that's
[10003.26 → 10013.34] them's the brakes then so you can't say privacy first profit second if actually when push comes to shove
[10013.34 → 10020.30] it's the other one and look it's not like apple's any different from the vast majority of other
[10020.30 → 10027.50] companies who would make the same decision fine just own it then that's all I'm asking just don't
[10027.50 → 10036.54] me just say yeah we know we'll comply with whatever laws in order to make sure that we can
[10036.54 → 10040.30] continue doing business in whatever key region just say that then
[10040.30 → 10045.98] don't pretend to be better than anybody that's all
[10050.78 → 10053.34] next up um
[10057.18 → 10063.02] okay, okay so we're in the bios uh is our boot drive showing up yeah I didn't see it there yeah
[10063.02 → 10070.62] there it is oh cool okay man that is a that is a fun looking bios look at man when did bios get so
[10070.62 → 10080.70] boring yeah look at that awesome uh do you think it might need something like on uh oh like CSM or
[10080.70 → 10087.02] something or um no not CSM the stupid legacy boot mode uh hold on just go to exit go to the exit one
[10087.02 → 10092.54] because sometimes the exit tab will just have like a boot to this particular device oh yeah this one too
[10096.94 → 10102.86] nope no dice yeah back to boot then hard drive boot priorities boot option one I mean if it shows up as
[10102.86 → 10109.34] a boot option theoretically it should just go right oh legacy only want to change storage to either
[10109.34 → 10117.42] oh no UFI only okay so we will, we already tried legacy then do you want to try UFI sure okay let's see
[10117.42 → 10117.82] what happens
[10123.66 → 10132.70] if f10 doesn't work it's illegal okay, okay put them in jail bios jail yeah Kevin b asks Linus any updates
[10132.70 → 10137.42] on your daily driving of the AirPods Pro 3s I'm really looking forward to hearing your thoughts after
[10137.42 → 10146.06] using them for a while after your fiery first impressions on short circuit I flew to Dallas Texas
[10147.02 → 10147.90] earlier this week
[10151.18 → 10161.50] the noise cancellation on the AirPods Pro 3s is so good that on a jet aircraft I could have just as easily
[10161.50 → 10172.38] been cruising at like 50 miles an hour on the highway wow like wow it is so good that i actually
[10173.10 → 10184.30] kind of wish that apple had like a staged or a faded like a gradual change from ANC to transparency
[10184.30 → 10189.18] mode is it shocking because it's jarring sometimes you turn off transparency like oh
[10190.06 → 10195.90] dang it's loud in here like it like you get adjusted to it um well I find the transparency
[10195.90 → 10201.18] mode on mine is louder than not having the headphones in the transparency mode on the AirPods Pro 3s is also
[10201.18 → 10209.82] just outstanding it's very natural like even my own speech is quite natural which is very difficult to do
[10209.82 → 10215.58] as far as I can tell because almost nobody executes it very well um
[10219.90 → 10226.70] sometimes the audio quality doesn't bother me, but there are certain situations where it is just
[10227.50 → 10233.34] not very good now I have heard that there's a new update and I have finally figured out my
[10233.34 → 10241.34] transition problems over to the iPhone air so once I pair my IP my AirPods pros to this um I should
[10241.34 → 10246.46] be able to apply the latest firmware update oh I should actually add that to my notes for the review
[10246.46 → 10252.94] that um if apple hasn't dealt with this yet I haven't actually checked if they haven't dealt with this
[10252.94 → 10259.26] yet but if apple still hasn't dealt with um there being absolutely no way to update the firmware on
[10259.26 → 10264.94] AirPods Pro 3s unless you also have an iPhone that is like should be criminal basically you should be
[10264.94 → 10271.58] able to apply updates to your device simply by having your device can you do it through oh wait
[10271.58 → 10274.38] maybe some I think someone might have mentioned before that you might be able to do it through
[10274.38 → 10281.58] iTunes can you do it through iTunes on pc someone let me know let me know in the chat um
[10282.62 → 10287.10] can you I'll just make a note for myself can you update without iPhone
[10287.10 → 10291.10] book okay now I got that in there that is something that I want to talk about one way or another
[10293.10 → 10299.74] um I think that's all i kind of have to say for now they still aren't as comfortable for me
[10300.86 → 10308.14] but I think I figured out why they did it because wow do they ever stay seated in your ear canal okay so
[10309.02 → 10315.90] you know I have those problems with the IEM's staying in my ear canal so I use the kind of older
[10315.90 → 10324.54] um version where it doesn't go in your ear they're yeah just earbuds instead of IEM's um
[10325.42 → 10333.90] but I got the AirPods non-pro 4 yeah is I think its proper name and that has ANC and transparency mode
[10333.90 → 10338.38] and honestly they drive me nuts and I wish I just had the old ones and I still use the old ones sometimes
[10338.38 → 10344.54] but my old ones the battery life in the right ear is terrible so it'll die way before the other one
[10344.54 → 10346.06] which sucks why don't you just replace the battery
[10350.22 → 10357.34] f***ING got them get trolled um the reason why I don't like them so much is because you
[10357.34 → 10364.06] don't have that insert from the IEM's the seal is terrible yeah and even in transparency mode it'll
[10364.06 → 10371.42] be like trying to figure it out, and it'll just start going oh like crazy, and it's like percussion
[10371.42 → 10378.38] against your ear it gets really intense um so I don't know it's annoying especially when you're
[10378.38 → 10382.62] like moving around doing stuff they'll move slightly in your ear and then the seal will break
[10383.50 → 10389.18] and it's again it's like man I find it really annoying to be honest with the seal it's good
[10389.18 → 10394.30] and man i have to say i I wake up with them both still in my ears which is pretty incredible like
[10394.30 → 10399.18] like sorry, sorry my pro twos fall out during the middle of the night all the time when it makes seal
[10400.14 → 10404.46] it sounds great yeah and like the ANC and the transparency mode is amazing all kinds of
[10404.46 → 10410.06] fantastic you just got to figure out how to wear in-ears or in canal I need those spring clips to be a
[10410.06 → 10418.94] thing nice I need to bring that back classic yeah let's see uh did we give up on this
[10419.50 → 10425.58] I can't get it past the black screen of death okay cool so hardware that says hardware uh it could
[10425.58 → 10432.22] just be that this drive is empty yeah yeah uh wouldn't it say hey boot stop it gives me boot device
[10432.22 → 10438.94] not necessarily I've seen this behaviour before personally okay I tried we should crank the
[10438.94 → 10445.98] transparency back up and make it purple nice oh I forgot to do no you're doing so many things it's
[10445.98 → 10450.94] all good I can read the next one Dan you're doing great I'll skip the look what Linux distro do you
[10450.94 → 10459.18] use and how has the experience been considering Linux myself for the last little bit I've been dual
[10459.18 → 10464.30] booting because there's some stuff I need to do in windows that like I could have VM'd and stuff but
[10464.30 → 10468.70] it was that was proven to be annoying so I've been dual booting um but the on the Linux side on my
[10468.70 → 10476.38] laptop I've been using arch the reason why I picked arch wasn't to be an um I'm better at Linux than
[10476.38 → 10483.42] you dude it was uh to prove that it was just because I'm a better than Linux dude no, no no and
[10483.42 → 10488.22] I'm good enough to run arch no, no that's fine you don't have to say it with relatively little knowledge
[10488.22 → 10492.94] you will say it, but you don't have to with relatively little knowledge experience or effort
[10492.94 → 10499.02] I have been able to run it just fine for months now totally just fine no problems updates all that
[10499.02 → 10506.62] stuff um, and it's been great and like I don't game on my laptop much but I have steam installed and I can
[10506.62 → 10513.98] play a game sometimes, and it's been very transparent like it doesn't feel like oh I'm using
[10513.98 → 10518.78] steam time trying to pull all these levers and do all these crazy things to get these games to work
[10518.78 → 10525.02] it's a download button it's a play button it's just like you're on Windows like it's very easy um
[10526.70 → 10531.26] so yeah the whole goal of this honestly was to be able to basically talk about it on Sancho
[10531.26 → 10539.42] um and point out that it's been fine and I picked the one that's hard and the reason so it was to show
[10539.42 → 10544.38] how great you are no it wasn't even though it's hard the point was that I've done nothing there's no
[10544.38 → 10551.02] there's no skill involved there's no skill so if you can't do it oh wow you must be beyond no skill
[10551.02 → 10557.26] because I am so godlike at running Linux it took no skill at all oh my god there was at the
[10557.26 → 10561.82] just at the intel event in Arizona that we were at there was like Linux nerds there asking me Linux
[10561.82 → 10567.26] questions because they heard that I was running it and I kept on being like I don't know it's not the
[10567.26 → 10573.50] point the point is that I don't have to do all these things, and it's still good like that's that's
[10573.50 → 10579.34] the point that's the interesting part so like i if I were you wouldn't necessarily pick arch it's not
[10579.34 → 10584.06] against father says Luke is swinging his Luke around the room as usual
[10587.26 → 10594.22] giant Linux dong oh my god the ah the point is that you can pick the one you want, and it's probably
[10594.22 → 10599.02] going to be fine let's go have fun I wish the rest of us could have picked it
[10602.30 → 10602.78] up next
[10604.94 → 10612.06] yeah sadly no infinite money glitch on gift cards no gift cards with gift cards what game is Luke
[10612.06 → 10616.94] playing right now did you ever finish boulders gate the third no you still haven't finished it
[10617.50 → 10624.06] you talk so much about how many characters how many characters are you on uh I think more
[10624.06 → 10628.30] one I think more than eight more than eight I'm pretty sure more than I got super far through a
[10628.30 → 10634.86] dirge run and then was just like yeah i have like three I could only play these 15 hours a day
[10635.82 → 10640.46] like there's not enough time I have a hard time not doing everything
[10641.58 → 10644.54] yeah and I have this style that must cost you a lot in chicken
[10644.54 → 10650.22] that's actually a perfect joke for Aldus gate
[10654.22 → 10662.86] I even like bears oh my both kinds oh my uh he kind of is both kinds I guess but anyway uh
[10662.86 → 10665.74] everyone's player sexual off that topic um
[10666.94 → 10671.34] Frick what was I going to say yeah i my one of my favourite ways to play with new people
[10671.34 → 10679.98] um is to not be the party face like make them be the party face um that's like playing the charisma
[10679.98 → 10685.58] character or the character that will do the dialogues basically because I've like done all the things in act one and act two
[10686.70 → 10693.02] like in act one and act two so do you really just think of them as things
[10693.02 → 10698.70] that just toys to his masculinity they're just chicken consumption
[10700.38 → 10707.58] they just eat your chicken, and then they're just you discard them you might be a wizard actually they could be poisoned
[10708.86 → 10714.86] um arcane chicken so my whole like yeah my whole thing is letting them because every once in a while
[10715.42 → 10719.90] even if very small there will be one little tiny thing that I haven't really experienced before
[10719.90 → 10726.86] but if I'm just making the decisions all the time it's going to be hard to do that because it's very likely that I'll just do the types of things that I would normally do
[10727.26 → 10730.14] even doing things in different orders can kind of change how the game plays
[10730.62 → 10738.30] um so I have so many campaigns that are in act two I have a few different campaigns that are in act three
[10739.66 → 10741.90] I have a ton of campaigns that never made it out of act one
[10741.90 → 10749.42] uh someone who I'd, I'd love to start playing with again I'd have to you know have a house together and
[10749.42 → 10755.02] my computer set up and stuff like that but uh i I started a game with Wendell and he this was like
[10755.02 → 10764.94] right early on in the game coming out, and he selected dirge without knowing oh what the hell what and Wendell's like the kindest nicest dude ever and then his character's just
[10764.94 → 10772.22] oh doing dirge things, and he's like ah that was I don't like this game very much i would love to
[10773.34 → 10778.22] start playing that again um but yeah I don't know I'll beat it eventually I'm in no particular rush
[10778.86 → 10785.18] well why would you have to beat it if you have all your things to use let's move on
[10785.18 → 10791.18] like Luke does from his things you're such an animal you're such an animal
[10793.58 → 10796.94] what comes immediately to your mind is the biggest news you've ever discussed
[10798.86 → 10803.82] what comes immediately to your mind as the biggest news you've ever discussed on the wand show
[10803.82 → 10812.30] uh I don't know maybe Silicon Valley bank um Facebook buying open AI
[10813.74 → 10820.30] what uh Facebook buying oculus oh other o company yeah not that um
[10821.98 → 10826.78] oh that was a big one for me that was a big one for me yeah um
[10829.34 → 10830.62] the biggest news
[10830.62 → 10833.82] the biggest news
[10835.66 → 10837.90] like the Silicon Valley bank thing was big but like
[10840.30 → 10843.66] I mean it didn't impact you or me exactly yeah or most of them
[10843.66 → 10845.34] it's like what was the biggest news to us
[10847.42 → 10854.86] CEO stepped down yeah I guess I mean would you say it's impact it has it's changed that much around here
[10854.86 → 10864.46] but you can say it did like I'm fine it depends on how you like in people's very average day to
[10864.46 → 10868.86] day I don't necessarily think it's changed a ton but there are certain things that have changed very
[10868.86 → 10874.46] significantly I would say tactful he's learning um
[10874.46 → 10878.78] not enough because you noticed so
[10879.50 → 10887.58] yeah whatever I mean like whatever political bullshittery I taught you a lot of it
[10887.58 → 10892.78] so
[10892.78 → 10895.26] um
[10899.26 → 10905.34] and to be clear the point is not to deceive the point is to yeah evade
[10905.34 → 10916.22] to speak without saying um it's pretty good though thanks yeah um
[10918.70 → 10921.82] man what am I I don't know
[10921.82 → 10929.90] yeah ChatGPT release was pretty wild says cams ta bro but I just wonder if there's like a recency bias there
[10931.18 → 10933.18] that was a bit ago
[10935.10 → 10936.86] oh yeah, yeah so it was
[10938.54 → 10941.74] the like crazy stream where we were like freaking out over yeah that was uh
[10941.74 → 10944.54] that's probably a couple of years ago is I think yeah
[10949.34 → 10955.42] let's see what else yeah the hack we didn't like announce on the wan show though like it
[10955.42 → 10960.22] like happened before yeah the YouTube video was kind of the big deal with the hack I think not so
[10960.22 → 10964.70] much the stream we did talk about it on the stream, but the news was already broken for sure
[10964.70 → 10968.70] yeah you know what i think the ChatGPT one was pretty big in terms of like
[10968.70 → 10975.98] I think that's impact on the world that feels correct yeah yeah okay let's go with that
[10977.18 → 10982.94] when ChatGPT released this is a Steph dot in float plane chat it was the first time in a while
[10982.94 → 10988.94] where I realized I was living in a history defining moment I think it was for us too which is one of the
[10988.94 → 10998.06] reasons why i I agree I think that's probably the almost three years really whoa yeah that seems crazy
[10999.10 → 11005.42] yeah wow the charged nuclei 8300 goes yeah everyone was worried about losing their jobs
[11006.38 → 11007.74] now we're losing our jobs
[11010.30 → 11016.38] yeah yeah, but it's usually not AI to be honest it's its except when it is
[11018.22 → 11025.10] yeah a lot of those have eventually come out as like um layoff excuses because they wanted to do
[11025.10 → 11029.98] layoffs not because they this is true yeah this is true it's returned to work and laid off because
[11029.98 → 11035.34] of AI is usually they actually just wanted to do layoffs regardless, and they found an excuse a lot
[11035.34 → 11043.66] of the AI replacing people thing isn't actually really like working i had an I've been doing home
[11043.66 → 11049.90] stuff was at Home Depot bought a thing walked up to the desk I was trying to figure out like is this
[11049.90 → 11054.06] self-checkout or not because there were employees standing by like most of them and the person
[11054.06 → 11059.98] walked up to me took my stuff and then did the self walked it to the self-checkout thing I've seen
[11059.98 → 11065.98] that did it for me and then just walked away and I was left to like pay and I was like how is this
[11065.98 → 11074.62] better like what are we doing scrappy DP says billet labs no you know they did one production run of
[11074.62 → 11078.30] that thing did they aren't they doing more stuff now though I think they have a YouTube channel and
[11078.30 → 11084.86] whatever but the actual product that I said was irrelevant ended up having exactly enough relevance
[11084.86 → 11090.70] for them to do one pre-order one production run and then never make it again
[11090.70 → 11102.70] so no I don't think that was a particularly consequential uh thing uh Brian asks ill
[11103.90 → 11109.98] what are your thoughts on the future of discrete intel arc cards particularly higher end given the
[11109.98 → 11119.50] recent intel NVIDIA partnership I'd really like a b770 or c 770 to be a thing we're hoping for the best man
[11120.22 → 11126.30] we're rooting for it right alongside you bring on future discrete arc it's going to be it's going to be
[11126.30 → 11134.06] great if it ever is it ever makes it I am so exciting excited I'm not exciting but I'm excited
[11135.90 → 11141.66] are you excited yes is it because I'm exciting yeah I don't think that's right oh stop it
[11141.66 → 11151.98] Brian asks hi Linus do you dream much uh sometimes I sleep like the living dead
[11152.54 → 11159.18] other times I wake up and I think I'm mid-conversation with someone and I have no idea
[11159.18 → 11166.14] where I am or what's going on because I was dreaming so lucidly that i I was pretty sure that I was awake
[11166.62 → 11173.58] uh so every everywhere in between and I have a particular I shouldn't even say particular ones i
[11173.58 → 11177.10] have like two different kinds of sleeping pills that I use once in a while and I like really need
[11177.10 → 11185.18] to sleep and my brain's just buzzing um and both of them in different ways give me just the most
[11185.18 → 11193.18] wackadoodle dreams so i I end up sleeping more but I end up resting less well I have to set alarms
[11193.18 → 11202.46] or have some perfect sunlight exposure in the room the sun coming up will wake me up um
[11203.58 → 11209.18] but if is I have like blackout blinds or whatever or even just not a lot of sun exposure into the
[11209.18 → 11215.74] room I can just sleep forever because I will lucid dream the heck out of it every single night, and it's
[11215.74 → 11223.82] been that way forever um I also have a problem where like if I get woken up say like three hours
[11223.82 → 11229.90] four hours into sleeping um and then fall back asleep my brain wants to like to reset, and it's like
[11229.90 → 11236.22] no we're going for eight again there 's's no other way, and it's it worries me for like when I'm
[11236.22 → 11242.46] older if I end up needing to do more often like charge nuclei with the bangers this week Luke sleeps like
[11242.46 → 11251.42] a bird you just put a blanket on you, it's like that's actually so true I hate you so much what's
[11251.42 → 11268.78] a circadian rhythm oh dark that's so true because when I go when I go on a plane no no you don't know
[11268.78 → 11274.38] this to you buddy when I go on a plane oh god one of my standard things that I pack in my like
[11274.38 → 11281.02] smaller bag I'll have my like switch I'll have some battery banks whatever else um is always a sweater
[11282.30 → 11287.02] even when I like when I went to Arizona I packed a sweater because I'll put the sweater on backwards
[11287.02 → 11292.94] so I put the hood over my head, and it like blacks everything I hate the eye covering things um
[11293.74 → 11297.98] and it just blacks everything out and I can I like
[11298.78 → 11306.14] flying back from Arizona I think it was like 8 p.m i I am not tired at 8 p.m on any day
[11306.14 → 11308.70] we get on the plane I was like out before takeoff
[11310.62 → 11314.38] so yeah that's actually I haven't heard that before that's a very good description
[11315.02 → 11323.18] I can't uh I can't find it right now but a picture of me definitely exists on social media somewhere of
[11323.18 → 11329.74] my plane move which involves a hoodie as well yeah but I cinch oh I've seen this tight yeah so that
[11329.74 → 11337.50] only my nose sticks out so that because I can't, I can't sleep if I'm breathing back in hood air oh yeah
[11337.50 → 11344.54] there's like a reason why I wear the full hoodie is that i I'll like usually lift a thing up down low
[11344.54 → 11351.42] so that's not enough for me yeah not enough yeah I've got to have the I've got to have the nose hole
[11351.42 → 11355.82] I definitely don't mind a little bit of recirculated air I can deal with that no problem
[11357.02 → 11363.90] anonymous asks here it is oh you found it yeah here it is uh yeah that's it no key found it, so this is my
[11363.90 → 11370.86] move so I actually end up with little pressure marks on the bridge of my nose here um but yeah it leaves it
[11370.86 → 11378.22] leaves my breathing holes open, but that's actually pretty good that's my move that's pretty
[11378.22 → 11385.02] good oh yeah this too um yeah yeah always hands in the pockets because otherwise I'm usually like this
[11385.58 → 11390.54] under the sweater right okay yeah yeah oh, oh like pulling the arm pulling in out of the arms
[11391.18 → 11395.90] because I do that I don't actually put the sweater like on it's on reverse oh i see so you just lay
[11395.90 → 11402.54] it on you yeah I'll wear the sweater but I'll pull I'll pull my arms out of the arms and then I'll
[11402.54 → 11408.94] just go like this yeah yeah I don't care if I'm in my 30s and I look like a child when you're
[11408.94 → 11415.58] on a plane you just all bets are off you get whatever rest you can yes exactly you get comfy and that's
[11415.58 → 11421.90] it is doesn't matter any more yep I know I look like a goof it's fine it doesn't matter to me
[11421.90 → 11427.82] uh but yeah I like basically wear it like a blanket because that's another thing I find it
[11427.82 → 11434.14] very hard to sleep unless like something is on top of me but there has been like very significant
[11434.14 → 11438.94] portions of my life where I'm sleeping is way too hot so I'll sleep with just a sheet but it just
[11438.94 → 11445.74] has to be like something um so wearing the sweater like that also like feels like I have a blanket on me
[11445.74 → 11449.50] I don't know it works I found a system I'm sticking to it hell yeah
[11451.58 → 11457.18] Linus thank you for some great videos this week what was the best part of the planetarium shoot
[11457.18 → 11465.74] LDT gamer dome win oh definitely climbing the dome dude so sick the fact that there was nobody who
[11465.74 → 11473.26] actually like worked for the McMillan space centre there to tell me no was like awesome important
[11473.26 → 11478.38] awesome the second you started climbing I was like there's no way they let them do that and then you
[11478.38 → 11484.46] just kept going I was like what yeah it's amazing massive what did they call it the like nexus speaker
[11484.46 → 11491.82] or whatever oh shoot what was it not apex uh I shouldn't have said a word something um yeah what
[11491.82 → 11496.22] was the speaker at the top called does someone remember not pinnacle that's not it I don't think it
[11496.22 → 11502.94] was someone's going to know someone's going to post it in chat but oh really sick name mass zenith yeah zenith whatever
[11502.94 → 11512.46] yeah so ah so cool dude it's been it's been you know what the upside is of channel momentum being a
[11512.46 → 11520.54] little bit low lately is when people make their way back to the channel after the long pause that
[11520.54 → 11526.86] they've had there are some bangers they're going to have an absolute killer back catalogue to go through
[11526.86 → 11534.78] this video is great the thumbnail really I don't know we need to do some more work on it or something
[11534.78 → 11541.02] because David did just such an amazing job of this video it's so cool we play around with underwater
[11541.02 → 11546.22] speakers that are for like synchronized swimming teams, and we like to put it in this guy's pool, and he's
[11546.22 → 11551.82] a local guy, and he makes like setups for it in his shop, and we tour shop, and it's like freaking awesome
[11551.82 → 11557.18] this video is funny where you like to bait him into jumping into the pool hilarious I didn't do that
[11557.18 → 11562.30] on purpose oh, oh no okay so what happened here oh my god
[11567.34 → 11574.30] there we go okay so what happened here is I was doing a dry run like we had done a few dry runs and
[11574.30 → 11581.18] I was just I was doing one more practice before I was going to be like okay let's go I thought because
[11581.82 → 11585.18] there's footage of him like there's another camera this one
[11590.22 → 11596.62] no that was not intentional oh it was so good so I was just I was doing yeah literal dry run thank
[11596.62 → 11602.62] you Conrad I like it um so I was just practicing the line and I was showing him the timing so I was
[11602.62 → 11608.62] showing him how I was going to telegraph the jump because we were supposed to jump in together so that
[11608.62 → 11612.62] it you guys ended up nailing it so it would look like this yeah we got it on the next take because
[11612.62 → 11617.90] we had done a few practices right so like the timing was the camera went right with your head
[11617.90 → 11622.22] yeah i actually I noticed when it when you guys did it again that I was like oh damn that was actually
[11622.22 → 11627.90] perfect yeah well because we that was that was probably the fourth time that I had sort
[11627.90 → 11631.98] of telegraphed the move yeah but then I was changing the intonation I was changing the timing a little bit
[11631.98 → 11637.34] so I was doing it one more time to show him how I was going to do it did you tell him that no but i also
[11637.34 → 11643.42] didn't tell him we were going for real this time so I just did the read for him like being him
[11643.42 → 11650.22] it's much safer for him to do what he did because he can come out and just like be wet, and it's fine
[11650.22 → 11656.14] yeah you can't really yeah I can't go from dry to wet again yeah so if someone's going to screw that up it
[11656.14 → 11660.86] it would be him so if you know if he has even the inkling of a thought that you're actually going for
[11660.86 → 11665.42] it is makes sense for him to go for it, I will defend the actions of the camera scrapyard
[11665.42 → 11670.54] wars 10 is a banger if you're into that this VR one is freaking awesome did you watch this yet
[11670.54 → 11676.14] I have not dude I've had no time it's this thing is so cool it's a VR headset from 1994.
[11676.14 → 11680.94] no I'm going to watch it I just have had because of the house renovations whatever dude had no time
[11680.94 → 11688.86] freaking awesome oh dude like under viewed videos this one right here is probably the most
[11688.86 → 11696.22] under viewed video on the channel because it starts out with this like real footage of proof's car
[11697.74 → 11699.98] and it's just me and Adam driving right
[11702.62 → 11717.50] this is probably one of the best intros we've ever done like top three for sure
[11718.86 → 11727.98] the fact that there's the little like jiggle too is crazy that motion platform is so cool
[11728.94 → 11737.34] so if you haven't seen the video like man what a cool setup, so wild is that incredible or what it's
[11737.34 → 11742.30] a really cool video oh and like dude i I've I've made some complaints about how long our videos are now
[11742.30 → 11749.66] that's a 22-minute video flies like it could have been 45 flies by like it's very dense yep so you
[11749.66 → 11755.82] know man I don't know it's going to be it's going to be a lot of fun for people who have made their way off
[11755.82 → 11764.06] the channel for one reason or another um and finally find their way back and are just like man why the
[11764.06 → 11770.14] heck did I stop watching because there's some really, really great videos in the library lately
[11770.14 → 11775.10] team has been absolutely freaking killing it do you do the crab thing underwater
[11776.38 → 11783.42] oh dude did you see the person who like an I'd it onto actual crabs or something yeah yeah the red
[11783.42 → 11791.18] it's been fun it's its so a bit of a rare moment but the Reddit has been fun it's it is so uncomfortable
[11791.18 → 11797.50] to look at, but hilarious all right hit me Dan Linus you said you're a big fan of made in Canada

[12061.34 → 12069.74] possibly be they're fine in a coal mine nope that would be a canary not a budgie I mean it'd probably
[12069.74 → 12075.66] work a budgie would oh it would work yeah would it work too well yeah I think so actually I think
[12075.66 → 12080.14] that's kind of the problem I think that is the problem what you could have both of them and then you
[12080.14 → 12087.10] could get you could get like different levels be like a thermometer the problem is the budgie I think
[12087.10 → 12089.90] would just die like just oh I've been outside
[12093.50 → 12099.58] that would suck it'd be a terrible it constantly goes off have you seen it would be the's
[12099.58 → 12104.38] okay alarm yeah true what have you seen the little contraptions that the miners would make to save the
[12104.38 → 12110.22] canaries crazy have you seen those yeah yeah they're actually I like that they cared yeah it's
[12110.22 → 12115.02] really nice makes me happy like they needed they only cared because it cost so much to get another
[12115.02 → 12119.82] one I was like shut up no I don't believe they were a life-saving technology, and they felt bad but
[12119.82 → 12126.38] it was all they had uh up next would you be willing to talk more about your experience with ADHD and working
[12126.38 → 12135.34] in a world that is not built for it what's your advice to help others who are struggling uh to succeed like you have um
[12138.94 → 12141.82] good luck um
[12143.50 → 12144.38] great advice
[12146.54 → 12154.38] every day is suffering, and it doesn't get better thanks Dan um, so the winner goes the spoils see ya
[12154.38 → 12165.90] I don't know man I mean so much of so much of everything is just not
[12167.98 → 12176.30] accepting any outcome other than success and to be clear that's not always going to work you might just
[12177.34 → 12183.82] you might be willing and able to try really hard, but you might just be really dumb you know and your
[12183.82 → 12189.18] ideas might just be terrible you can still, and it might not you know I just mean like what I mean
[12189.18 → 12194.22] is just like trying really hard at something that's a bad idea it won't be a recipe for success you have
[12194.22 → 12201.82] to have a combination you have to have a willingness to win you have to have uh you have to have a fortunate
[12201.82 → 12206.78] situation like you know Luke and I often talk about how we grew up without a lot of money but
[12207.34 → 12215.18] what we were both lucky to have been supportive families right and that's something that is worth more than any amount of money
[12215.50 → 12223.82] so you know we were very privileged in that way for sure right and so you have to have an opportunity you have to have
[12224.54 → 12226.86] um you have to have just like
[12226.86 → 12237.18] like genetic lottery luck um like there's a lot of things that have to align for success um but
[12238.46 → 12245.82] what every single successful person has in common and I don't mean people who were handed money I don't
[12245.82 → 12256.06] consider just the act of having money success um but people who earned a place in the world like
[12256.46 → 12262.22] what they all have in common is they all worked their butt off and didn't take failure as an option
[12262.86 → 12270.86] um and so that's yeah that that's it your people hate that answer, and we've gotten flamed for this
[12270.86 → 12277.58] answer repeatedly over time yeah it doesn't change the hustle culture is toxic the grind set
[12277.58 → 12284.46] is whatever that's fine neat but then just you know you've got to you've got to define what your goals
[12284.46 → 12289.34] are yeah exactly, but that's not what I'm being asked yeah right like
[12292.86 → 12298.38] and there's no like there's no I don't know there's no auto win button so when people don't like
[12298.38 → 12303.10] adds says ADHD person trying to focus in order to provide tips on ADHD well yeah
[12303.10 → 12307.50] yeah
[12310.38 → 12317.18] doing my best over here i will never not try hard that's what i uh that's what I told uh
[12317.18 → 12321.02] badminton insight when they came and did the collab when they like trained me like a pro
[12321.58 → 12328.14] for the day uh so I did like their professional training regimen and like it kicked my butt and they
[12328.14 → 12333.26] were like I can't believe you're still going and I'm like well that's the only thing that I can offer
[12333.26 → 12339.02] any coach who has ever coached me is that I will do my absolute best every single time sometimes my
[12339.02 → 12347.82] best will be trash and I just like I won't hit a single shot um but I will do my best for the entire
[12347.82 → 12353.74] session and when it's over I will go have a bath and then I will come back the next day and I will do
[12353.74 → 12360.46] my best and my best might be trash again but damn it I will do my best and that's all I can offer
[12361.10 → 12365.42] um and maybe part of it is just accepting that sometimes you're going to do your best and
[12365.42 → 12370.86] it's going to be trash, and you just have to keep doing it anyway because anything else is not going to
[12370.86 → 12374.70] win you will never win sandbagging it
[12374.70 → 12385.90] Linus alabaster dawn cross code quote unquote sequel got a demo maybe a while before 1.0 but from the

[12509.10 → 12514.06] it's not even announced or whatever I'll let chat explain it to you happen oh
[12518.62 → 12523.10] understood
[12526.54 → 12526.86] Dan
[12526.86 → 12536.38] Linus went to Luke, and it took a while to get over here to quite far away oh
[12538.30 → 12545.34] fire tonight it's not even the gonorrhea l and d we need to explain vid oh that's an incoming Linus
[12545.34 → 12551.34] what's your favourite colour uh how often are you how many times are you going to curate this question
[12551.34 → 12556.62] Dan I don't know you just say a colour, and then we can move on oh my god I would say it's a one word
[12557.18 → 12563.18] we have a favourite colour it's complicated moving on I don't have a favourite
[12569.66 → 12574.62] what's your favourite band okay do you like play 22 or some 41
[12574.62 → 12581.02] what's your favourite band you want to get here boy hi DLL have you ordered the pebble yet no they're
[12581.02 → 12586.46] starting to ship the white pebble too oh that's a question I don't know no I actually didn't get
[12586.46 → 12594.46] around to ordering one yeah really um okay I'll, I'll get in touch okay
[12604.62 → 12608.78] this might be a Luke question actually last one I've got here
[12611.18 → 12619.42] what do you think let's try it why does certain gods like wan show on float plane stream very poorly to
[12619.42 → 12626.54] my TV using cast for the last six months even the lowest quality only plays audio the video freeze
[12626.54 → 12632.94] frames well the float plane casting feature is
[12634.62 → 12642.62] hot garbage questionably existent um and theoretically hopefully a lot of deaf time into
[12642.62 → 12648.06] it no neither has Google so it is what it is um hopefully theoretically eventually won't be
[12648.06 → 12653.50] necessarily because we will have a float plane app for TVs it is not coming soon, but we have been
[12653.50 → 12658.62] working towards it for a while, and we will get there eventually um I know people have been wanting
[12658.62 → 12664.46] it we have not been ignoring you which is a small team it takes us time um, but it's its coming so
[12664.62 → 12672.62] yeah sorry there are yeah yeah yeah uh
[12675.66 → 12682.94] olive I think is the name um hydration is an option there 's's a there's a few I've heard very good
[12682.94 → 12690.46] things about hydration um, but there are a few different options for uh like open source other people made
[12691.02 → 12695.26] apps for the TVs and stuff you can use theirs we want to have a first party version eventually
[12695.26 → 12699.90] because that's what people are going to look for uh, but there are other ones that as far
[12699.90 → 12704.54] as my understanding goes actually work quite well so you can check those out remember correctly I talked
[12704.54 → 12707.66] to the hydrovan guy a while ago, and it was super cool
[12711.50 → 12719.50] last one I got here Linus the leather jacket it has that middle so for the two zippers have both zipper
[12719.50 → 12727.90] pulls on each right side and tabs on the left this way you can use it without the middle without the second
[12727.90 → 12735.58] zipper yes that is the plan so this middle section here where there's a second zipper because it's
[12735.58 → 12743.50] designed by AI yes this side is female and this is male and this is female and this is male so you
[12743.50 → 12750.54] can actually zip it together and make it like a slimmer fit oh um by taking out the middle section if you
[12750.54 → 12755.98] want, so the stock fit will be a little bit on the huskier side, and then you'll be able to make it a
[12755.98 → 12765.02] slimmer fit by bringing it together to be clear no it is not entirely designed by AI Matthew from our
[12765.02 → 12772.78] creator warehouse design fashion team um did generate a bunch of leather jackets, and so we did take a ton of
[12772.78 → 12778.14] inspiration from an AI generated leather jacket so it has a bunch of like pockets that don't do anything
[12778.14 → 12783.66] and like little like straps and stuff that don't attach anything, and it has two front zippers which
[12783.66 → 12791.10] was an AI innovation, but it took a lot of work still to turn that AI generated nonsense into something
[12791.10 → 12798.62] that's actually wearable by a human um, and it's going to be awesome we're calling it the Jensen i oh
[12798.62 → 12805.58] actually I haven't reached out lately but i I messaged our NVIDIA contact like months ago saying like hey
[12805.58 → 12813.02] what are the odds that we could gift Jensen one oh my god and have him like wear it on stage or
[12813.02 → 12819.18] something like and the AI generated leather jacket you don't think so why not hell no why not I think
[12819.18 → 12822.86] you should try you should definitely you don't think he would unquestionably you should try you
[12822.86 → 12830.38] don't think that Jensen would like the story of our jacket doesn't have the balls what it's a challenge
[12830.38 → 12835.02] what kind of thing to say is that he should do it well yeah he should do it but why would you think
[12835.02 → 12840.46] that he would not be into wearing a jacket that was designed by AI because it's designed poorly
[12840.46 → 12848.54] in his whole things that he wants to show off good AI um, but he also talks a lot about AI as a tool
[12849.26 → 12855.82] for humans to do work so like that's what it was we used it for design inspiration, and it did some
[12855.82 → 12863.02] pretty wacky stuff but as wacky as the stuff is literally everyone that I showed this jacket to in
[12863.02 → 12869.74] person is like that's a super cool jacket so yeah sure it's covered in a bunch of buckles that have
[12869.74 → 12877.66] no purpose but does a leather jacket need a purpose for a buckle other than to look cool make it cost
[12878.94 → 12885.98] an obscene amount of money, and then he'd like it maybe like make it come across as like
[12885.98 → 12889.26] it actually does look pretty good it does look good yeah
[12891.90 → 12900.06] um what do you float plane chat oh hold on I'm trying to I'm trying to find a good uh I'm trying
[12900.06 → 12905.90] to find a good shot of it where I'm not just like behind a thing I think it's uh I think it's over here
[12905.90 → 12911.34] somewhere where do I put on the jacket oh yeah I put on the jacket here what would you guys think real
[12911.34 → 12919.34] leather this is probably worth like what would you pay for this you make it tall uh probably not
[12919.34 → 12926.70] at all sorry Dan I was talking to Matthew and said could I request a one-of-one sample tall and pay out
[12926.70 → 12933.18] the ass for it um I think that if you're giving the money to Luke he'd strongly prefer that it was nowhere
[12933.18 → 12938.54] near your ass he wouldn't even want a dollar if it was from your ass but anyway hold on carry on but
[12938.54 → 12946.14] he'll take a bathroom one no I said no he's truck stuff all those okay someone in full plane chat
[12946.14 → 12952.46] I saw it asked if I'd take one off the floor of a Japanese bathroom 400 600 I mean they use them for
[12952.46 → 12961.02] shower water 200 to 300 pokey brick I don't think you're being very realistic um 400 800 500 to 600
[12961.02 → 12967.98] at least 400 I would not real leather like actual animals yeah 500 400 500
[12967.98 → 12976.62] us that'd be like six to eight hundred dollars I think that I think that much of chat will be
[12977.98 → 12984.94] happy not all of them and Dan will be pleasantly surprised I will say that much
[12986.30 → 12992.94] I have some idea of pricing now my I'd say somewhere between 350 and 450 that's my guess that's
[12992.94 → 13000.78] a very low guess sir for leather goods usd yeah that's a that's a very low guess for like real
[13000.78 → 13006.30] is actual leather with this many things that many things might change it I remember yeah I don't know
[13006.30 → 13011.50] if you remember this I had a leather jacket that I wore all the time no I don't remember that when
[13011.50 → 13019.10] was that this is a long time ago okay um and for not that long of a period of time but I wore it a lot
[13019.10 → 13023.50] no I don't remember talking about this because you and i both lost like the fanciest jackets we'd
[13023.50 → 13029.02] ever bought, and it wasn't that far apart I think yeah yeah I do remember that it was called it's always
[13029.02 → 13034.78] from danger leather oh that's mine too, and they like to name their jackets like people names yeah and
[13034.78 → 13041.66] it was Luke nice and I didn't know that until I had like picked it and then I was like no way and
[13041.66 → 13048.14] then when it got stolen I went to go back and buy another one, and they were gone um, but that was like
[13050.38 → 13054.54] is danger leather like real leather is that I don't think so yep I mean they have different
[13054.54 → 13060.30] levels of quality mine one was real leather it was the only medium tall like weird not bomber that
[13060.30 → 13066.14] like because like they've got this one oh it's on an insane sale that might explain it they're not doing
[13066.14 → 13074.30] so hot ah whoa that's a sale if I've ever seen a sale is it only there's only like one size left
[13074.30 → 13079.34] though that's pretty normal okay so it's like yeah it's only in my inventory size yeah yeah
[13079.90 → 13083.82] so what's something that's actually let's look at this jacket yeah the Asher oh okay wow oh it's my
[13083.82 → 13089.50] brother's name this is Canadian, but this is a very simple jacket compared to the one you're showing
[13089.50 → 13095.58] yes there's really not a lot going on here yep um let's go try to find something a little bit more
[13095.58 → 13103.42] complicated speaking of Canadian artists don't have them that was a little bit more things so
[13103.42 → 13104.46] complicated
[13110.46 → 13115.26] the Jackson maybe I know he's not but I love just thinking that that guy's just giving you a thumbs up
[13116.54 → 13121.58] nice what up dude this guy to this guy too hey you want to
[13121.58 → 13128.06] hey hey hey I mean that was a little bit more complicated it's still not anywhere near so as
[13128.06 → 13131.98] yours and I think part of the reason why I think it is because of his under thing that he has going
[13131.98 → 13134.38] on so maybe not but yeah that's 627.
[13137.34 → 13142.30] they're just all a lot more simple is what I'm getting out of well because it's easier to make
[13142.30 → 13145.90] that makes sense yep, and they're also a mass manufacturer ah
[13145.90 → 13154.30] well good luck us uh I hope we sell a few and uh I think some people will be
[13155.18 → 13163.90] pleasantly surprised um including Dan I added the word designer and immediately found a 38 000
[13163.90 → 13170.22] jacket yep cool what do you get let's see it let's see it is it worth it fend so no
[13170.22 → 13177.10] but I mean that was an impossible oh it's not even leather are companies still making fur is this
[13177.10 → 13182.70] fur yeah sheepskin animals it's lamb ram it's male sheep
[13185.82 → 13190.46] really I thought fur was like this guy this looks like the guy from Game of Thrones almost
[13191.18 → 13195.34] I don't know his character name or the actor name so good luck is there just one picture
[13196.30 → 13203.98] they went to all the work to get a model and have him put it on, and they took one picture
[13203.98 → 13205.02] the shirt looks so bad
[13209.26 → 13213.34] it's like a lot of money I don't like this stuff I'm going away
[13217.18 → 13221.90] pion gray joy sure I don't know I don't know their names, but he looks kind of like that guy
[13221.90 → 13229.50] okay if that's the right guy that's all I got our workman says fur is tremendously out of fashion
[13229.50 → 13239.74] and crystal says yes fur is still a thing uh all right wow um cool apparently the British army
[13239.74 → 13248.06] still uses Canadian black and brown bear fur huh cat OS says I'm a furry does that count the answer is
[13248.06 → 13250.94] no we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[13254.06 → 13257.74] bye bye bye would that mean you have to use them
[13259.50 → 13273.74] it's so much worse skinning them it would be ethical
[13273.74 → 13279.30] you
