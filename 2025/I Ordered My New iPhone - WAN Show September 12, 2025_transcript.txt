[0.00 --> 7.22]  What is up you fine folks and welcome to the
[7.22 --> 10.98]  That's never happened before
[10.98 --> 14.30]  I swear that's never happened before
[14.30 --> 16.04]  First time
[16.04 --> 17.72]  First time
[17.72 --> 19.72]  Look I'm almost 40
[19.72 --> 24.20]  We got a great show for you guys today
[24.20 --> 26.52]  Apple's event
[26.52 --> 27.82]  Was actually
[27.82 --> 29.86]  Maybe kind of exciting
[29.86 --> 34.52]  It could just be that my excitement about the new AirPods Pro 3s
[34.52 --> 36.72]  Is bleeding over into all the other products
[36.72 --> 38.30]  That might be true but they look really cool
[38.30 --> 39.70]  Maybe the rest of them are crap
[39.70 --> 43.18]  But the AirPods Pro 3s look pretty freaking awesome
[43.18 --> 45.10]  In other news this week
[45.10 --> 48.34]  The real self-driving
[48.34 --> 50.84]  Was the friends we made along the way
[50.84 --> 53.92]  Tesla has changed the definition of
[53.92 --> 55.46]  Full self-driving
[55.46 --> 57.98]  Completely abandoning their promise of
[57.98 --> 59.56]  Unsupervised autonomous driving
[59.56 --> 60.50]  We'll be talking about that later
[60.50 --> 61.56]  What else we got this week?
[61.82 --> 64.60]  Nintendo gets another video game patent
[64.60 --> 65.78]  And the whole internet
[65.78 --> 67.32]  Loved that
[67.32 --> 68.18]  No
[68.18 --> 68.84]  No they didn't
[68.84 --> 69.44]  Also
[69.44 --> 72.12]  For the people that said
[72.12 --> 74.36]  That the AI summary things
[74.36 --> 76.20]  Were definitely not doing anything to search
[76.20 --> 77.76]  Google has now admitted
[77.76 --> 80.04]  That the open web is in rapid decline
[80.04 --> 81.30]  Yeah rapid decline
[81.30 --> 83.40]  Not just regular decline
[83.40 --> 85.46]  The rapidest of declines
[85.46 --> 85.90]  Cool
[85.90 --> 87.30]  Nice
[87.30 --> 89.78]  Awesome
[89.78 --> 91.54]  Don't you love when our corporate overlords
[91.54 --> 92.92]  Confirm what we knew all along?
[93.30 --> 93.54]  Yeah
[93.54 --> 94.26]  I just
[94.26 --> 94.76]  Yeah
[94.76 --> 113.88]  The show today is brought to you
[113.88 --> 115.26]  By Proton
[115.26 --> 116.24]  Vessi
[116.24 --> 117.14]  Squarespace
[117.14 --> 118.18]  And Delta Hub
[118.18 --> 119.32]  Alongside of course
[119.32 --> 120.14]  Our wrap partner
[120.14 --> 120.76]  Dbrand
[120.76 --> 121.66]  Our laptop partner
[121.66 --> 121.94]  Dell
[121.94 --> 122.90]  And our chair partner
[122.90 --> 123.76]  Secret Lab
[123.76 --> 124.76]  That's right my friends
[124.76 --> 126.96]  It's hard times
[126.96 --> 128.02]  We have
[128.02 --> 129.66]  Seven sponsors
[129.66 --> 130.34]  On the way
[130.34 --> 130.78]  And show
[130.78 --> 132.18]  We're gonna
[132.18 --> 133.28]  We're gonna spread them out
[133.28 --> 133.94]  A little bit though
[133.94 --> 135.70]  Gonna sprinkle them here and there
[135.70 --> 137.92]  We need
[137.92 --> 138.92]  We need more
[138.92 --> 140.58]  Like
[140.58 --> 141.38]  The
[141.38 --> 142.80]  Product placement ones
[142.80 --> 144.66]  We need to just go full
[144.66 --> 145.04]  Like
[145.04 --> 145.52]  Sure
[145.52 --> 146.56]  We could wear like
[146.56 --> 147.14]  Nike
[147.14 --> 148.84]  Headbands and stuff
[148.84 --> 149.78]  What's that movie?
[150.46 --> 151.26]  Oh man
[151.26 --> 152.22]  That movie
[152.22 --> 153.22]  With Ricky Bobby?
[153.44 --> 153.78]  Gremlins
[153.78 --> 155.26]  No not Ricky Bobby
[155.26 --> 156.14]  The music one
[156.14 --> 157.94]  The music movie
[157.94 --> 159.48]  La La Land
[159.48 --> 161.02]  Was it also a comedy?
[161.02 --> 161.64]  What the f*** are you even talking about?
[161.66 --> 162.40]  It was a comedy
[162.40 --> 163.30]  Walk Hard?
[163.30 --> 163.88]  No
[163.88 --> 166.78]  I have no details for anyone
[166.78 --> 167.70]  You're a great
[167.70 --> 168.26]  Wayne's World
[168.26 --> 168.90]  There we go
[168.90 --> 169.80]  Oh my god
[169.80 --> 170.50]  Why did you so much
[170.50 --> 171.72]  The music one
[171.72 --> 173.82]  With like
[173.82 --> 174.56]  The Pizza Hut
[174.56 --> 175.70]  Breaking the fourth wall
[175.70 --> 176.82]  Talking right to camera
[176.82 --> 177.62]  Yeah yeah yeah yeah
[177.62 --> 178.20]  You know that
[178.20 --> 179.20]  Every movie
[179.20 --> 180.38]  Has music in it
[180.38 --> 180.60]  Right?
[180.66 --> 181.14]  Oh I just
[181.14 --> 182.18]  Whacked the mic
[182.18 --> 182.90]  I'm sorry
[182.90 --> 184.86]  You know
[184.86 --> 185.52]  I meant
[185.52 --> 186.74]  I meant
[186.74 --> 187.64]  Wayne's World
[187.64 --> 188.48]  We knew that
[188.48 --> 189.24]  So tired
[189.24 --> 190.24]  He's kind of drunk
[190.24 --> 191.38]  Linus was fun
[191.38 --> 192.82]  But I don't think
[192.82 --> 193.46]  We knew that
[193.46 --> 194.10]  So tired
[194.10 --> 195.04]  He's kind of drunk
[195.04 --> 196.32]  Luke was this fun
[196.32 --> 198.16]  You're stupid today
[198.16 --> 202.36]  So for context
[202.36 --> 205.86]  I started my journey home
[205.86 --> 206.76]  At
[206.76 --> 208.02]  I think it was like
[208.02 --> 210.14]  4pm
[210.14 --> 211.54]  Thursday
[211.54 --> 213.44]  Bulgarian time
[213.44 --> 214.14]  Yes
[214.14 --> 214.92]  And I have been on
[214.92 --> 215.66]  Various forms
[215.66 --> 216.36]  That means something to me
[216.36 --> 217.30]  Of transportation
[217.30 --> 218.50]  Ever since then
[218.50 --> 219.34]  Perhaps planes
[219.34 --> 220.54]  Trains and automobiles
[220.54 --> 222.00]  Another great movie
[222.00 --> 223.30]  With music in it
[223.30 --> 225.86]  Three planes
[225.86 --> 227.16]  Three trains
[227.16 --> 228.26]  Two Ubers
[228.26 --> 229.20]  And one Emma
[229.20 --> 229.70]  Picking me up
[229.70 --> 230.12]  From the airport
[230.12 --> 231.10]  That was the chain
[231.10 --> 231.56]  Of events
[231.56 --> 232.70]  That had to get me home
[232.70 --> 234.68]  And
[234.68 --> 237.80]  Two of the planes
[237.80 --> 238.58]  Were late
[238.58 --> 240.68]  Nice
[240.68 --> 242.58]  I think every single train
[242.58 --> 243.12]  Was late
[243.12 --> 243.98]  Two of them were late
[243.98 --> 245.00]  By like 50 minutes
[245.00 --> 246.28]  The only answer is
[246.28 --> 247.22]  Gamer plane
[247.22 --> 249.06]  And gamer train
[249.06 --> 250.42]  It could have needed
[250.42 --> 250.72]  All
[250.72 --> 251.42]  Gamer car
[251.42 --> 252.38]  And gamer fire truck
[252.38 --> 253.58]  You have the gamer van
[253.58 --> 254.76]  We got the fire truck bro
[254.76 --> 255.32]  And the fire truck
[255.32 --> 256.36]  We got the fire truck
[256.36 --> 256.80]  Okay cool
[256.80 --> 257.80]  That's the only answer
[257.80 --> 259.24]  So road is already
[259.24 --> 259.94]  Taken care of
[259.94 --> 260.30]  Yep
[260.30 --> 262.40]  Okay where are we
[262.40 --> 264.04]  Apple product launch
[264.04 --> 265.58]  Apple is launching
[265.58 --> 267.18]  A ton of new products
[267.18 --> 267.86]  On September
[267.86 --> 269.22]  19th
[269.22 --> 270.18]  They are all
[270.18 --> 271.04]  Getting their new
[271.04 --> 272.34]  Square sensor
[272.34 --> 273.68]  Center stage front cam
[273.68 --> 274.60]  Okay I swear
[274.60 --> 275.96]  I don't know if I ever
[275.96 --> 276.74]  Said it in a video
[276.74 --> 278.08]  Or if I ever told you
[278.08 --> 279.46]  But I totally thought
[279.46 --> 280.12]  Of this idea
[280.12 --> 281.28]  Like ages ago
[281.28 --> 282.80]  Did I ever talk to you
[282.80 --> 283.50]  About the idea
[283.50 --> 284.98]  Of having a square sensor
[284.98 --> 286.58]  So that you could just like
[286.58 --> 287.74]  Shoot landscape
[287.74 --> 288.52]  Like this
[288.52 --> 289.38]  Or so that you could
[289.38 --> 290.14]  Just shoot square
[290.14 --> 291.16]  And then you could like
[291.16 --> 291.98]  Crop it later
[291.98 --> 292.64]  And it could just have
[292.64 --> 293.42]  Safe zones on it
[293.42 --> 293.66]  Or whatever
[293.66 --> 294.00]  I don't know when you
[294.00 --> 294.58]  Had that idea
[294.58 --> 295.38]  But I remember this
[295.38 --> 295.88]  Vaguely
[295.88 --> 297.32]  I don't even care
[297.32 --> 298.36]  Who had the idea
[298.36 --> 298.82]  First
[298.82 --> 300.74]  I love that Apple
[300.74 --> 301.46]  Is doing this
[301.46 --> 303.10]  So their new selfie cams
[303.10 --> 304.90]  On the iPhone 17 lineup
[304.90 --> 306.56]  Just allow you to go
[306.56 --> 307.86]  Oh yeah I'm taking
[307.86 --> 308.86]  A vertical selfie
[308.86 --> 310.02]  My friends
[310.02 --> 311.46]  Who are paid
[311.46 --> 312.46]  By me
[312.46 --> 313.26]  Are now nearby
[313.26 --> 314.82]  They don't want to get
[314.82 --> 315.62]  That close right now
[315.62 --> 315.90]  Apparently
[315.90 --> 317.50]  Yeah there we go
[317.50 --> 318.36]  And boom
[318.36 --> 320.72]  It'll just expand the frame
[320.72 --> 322.74]  And use additional sensor
[322.74 --> 323.44]  In order to fit the
[323.44 --> 324.90]  Okay
[324.90 --> 326.34]  It's powered by
[326.34 --> 326.84]  AI
[326.84 --> 328.46]  Apple intelligence
[328.46 --> 329.62]  Which means it
[329.62 --> 331.36]  Will probably suck
[331.36 --> 332.04]  For a bit
[332.04 --> 332.68]  Yeah I wonder
[332.68 --> 333.72]  What the AI is doing
[333.72 --> 334.86]  Hopefully not much
[334.86 --> 335.44]  Hopefully
[335.44 --> 336.68]  Very little
[336.68 --> 337.06]  Yeah
[337.06 --> 338.16]  And if it's doing
[338.16 --> 339.22]  If all it's doing
[339.22 --> 340.78]  Is recognizing human faces
[340.78 --> 341.14]  Which
[341.14 --> 341.72]  Then sure
[341.72 --> 343.14]  Realistically machine learning
[343.14 --> 343.50]  Has been
[343.50 --> 343.94]  Already doing that
[343.94 --> 344.78]  Pretty good at
[344.78 --> 345.98]  For a minute or two
[345.98 --> 346.44]  Very effective
[346.44 --> 347.40]  Very good
[347.40 --> 349.42]  Then I see that as
[349.42 --> 351.26]  Just an outstanding feature
[351.26 --> 352.82]  They all get the new
[352.82 --> 354.78]  Ceramic shield 2 front glass
[354.78 --> 356.18]  I mean Apple's front glass
[356.18 --> 356.64]  Has been
[356.64 --> 358.90]  For a while now
[358.90 --> 359.98]  Original ceramic shield
[359.98 --> 360.84]  Was already awesome
[360.84 --> 361.82]  This new one
[361.82 --> 362.86]  I mean presumably
[362.86 --> 363.74]  Could only be better
[363.74 --> 365.12]  But that's not
[365.12 --> 366.06]  Necessarily true
[366.06 --> 366.96]  Because we have
[366.96 --> 368.02]  Seen cases where
[368.02 --> 368.86]  From one iteration
[368.86 --> 370.34]  Of Corning Gorilla Glass
[370.34 --> 370.82]  To another
[370.82 --> 372.22]  Sometimes there are
[372.22 --> 372.84]  Trade-offs
[372.84 --> 373.86]  Like you gain
[373.86 --> 374.78]  Some drop resistance
[374.78 --> 375.52]  But you lose
[375.52 --> 376.60]  Some scratch resistance
[376.60 --> 377.78]  And so on and so forth
[377.78 --> 378.76]  They also
[378.76 --> 379.60]  All
[379.60 --> 380.66]  All the new iPhones
[380.66 --> 381.76]  Start with
[381.76 --> 383.62]  256 gigs of storage
[383.62 --> 384.84]  And even the base
[384.84 --> 385.74]  iPhone 17
[385.74 --> 386.26]  Is now
[386.26 --> 387.44]  120
[387.44 --> 388.96]  Flippin hertz
[388.96 --> 389.98]  On the display
[389.98 --> 391.02]  That's pretty sick
[391.02 --> 391.04]  That
[391.04 --> 394.26]  Brings them up to speed
[394.26 --> 395.86]  With cheap Android phones
[395.86 --> 396.74]  From years ago
[396.74 --> 398.46]  But what it also does
[398.46 --> 399.38]  If we can sort of
[399.38 --> 400.20]  Put away the
[400.20 --> 401.92]  Snarky hat for a minute
[401.92 --> 403.92]  Is it takes away
[403.92 --> 404.86]  The obstacles
[404.86 --> 406.22]  That many iPhone
[406.22 --> 407.54]  Upgraders
[407.54 --> 408.42]  Who are sitting there
[408.42 --> 408.86]  Going okay
[408.86 --> 409.60]  When are they going to do it
[409.60 --> 410.34]  When are they going to do it
[410.34 --> 411.06]  When are they going to do it
[411.06 --> 411.70]  I want
[411.70 --> 413.28]  I want those features
[413.28 --> 414.36]  That have been highlights
[414.36 --> 415.32]  Of the Pro series
[415.32 --> 416.08]  But I want them on the
[416.08 --> 416.74]  Regular iPhone
[416.74 --> 417.46]  Because I don't want to
[417.46 --> 417.68]  Spend
[417.68 --> 418.32]  Two
[418.32 --> 419.42]  Thousand
[419.42 --> 420.18]  US dollars
[420.18 --> 421.64]  On the top spec
[421.64 --> 423.94]  iPhone 17 Pro Max
[423.94 --> 424.38]  I think is
[424.38 --> 425.38]  Two grand
[425.38 --> 426.60]  What a name
[426.60 --> 427.20]  But it has
[427.20 --> 428.30]  Two terabytes
[428.30 --> 429.42]  Of storage in it
[429.42 --> 430.22]  That is absurd
[430.22 --> 430.86]  The lineup
[430.86 --> 432.00]  Just honestly
[432.00 --> 433.10]  Looks really good
[433.10 --> 433.64]  The only thing
[433.64 --> 434.24]  This
[434.24 --> 434.86]  This like
[434.86 --> 435.56]  Base model
[435.56 --> 436.46]  iPhone 17
[436.46 --> 437.00]  Though like
[437.00 --> 437.48]  Actually
[437.48 --> 439.42]  Looks pretty killer
[439.42 --> 439.76]  I mean
[439.76 --> 440.82]  Apple's SOCs
[440.82 --> 441.54]  Have been
[441.54 --> 442.82]  Just plain better
[442.82 --> 444.58]  For a very long time
[444.58 --> 445.22]  At this point
[445.22 --> 446.40]  Eight gigs of RAM
[446.40 --> 448.08]  Is plenty for iOS
[448.08 --> 448.86]  Even if we
[448.86 --> 449.46]  Realistically
[449.46 --> 450.82]  Do need
[450.82 --> 451.40]  More
[451.40 --> 452.26]  To run Android
[452.26 --> 453.02]  Really smoothly
[453.02 --> 453.78]  With heavy task
[453.78 --> 454.32]  Switching
[454.32 --> 456.34]  6.3 inch display
[456.34 --> 457.32]  48 megapixel
[457.32 --> 457.78]  So yeah
[457.78 --> 458.26]  It has two
[458.26 --> 459.08]  48 megapixel
[459.08 --> 459.96]  Sensors on the back
[459.96 --> 460.68]  Personally
[460.68 --> 462.40]  Ah man
[462.40 --> 463.12]  Oh this is actually
[463.12 --> 463.50]  The tough one
[463.50 --> 464.14]  I was about to say
[464.14 --> 464.78]  I don't use my
[464.78 --> 465.58]  Telephoto much
[465.58 --> 467.16]  But the times
[467.16 --> 467.90]  I use it
[467.90 --> 469.24]  Boy do I ever
[469.24 --> 470.06]  Like it
[470.06 --> 471.06]  So I shouldn't
[471.06 --> 471.52]  Even say
[471.52 --> 472.42]  The times I use it
[472.42 --> 472.90]  Because I don't
[472.90 --> 473.60]  Have a telephoto
[473.60 --> 474.42]  I'm running a
[474.42 --> 475.16]  Pixel 9a
[475.16 --> 475.60]  Right now
[475.60 --> 476.44]  But Yvonne
[476.44 --> 476.80]  On her
[476.80 --> 477.62]  S23 Ultra
[477.62 --> 478.70]  Had a really
[478.70 --> 479.72]  Great telephoto
[479.72 --> 480.54]  And if we were
[480.54 --> 481.04]  At a kids
[481.04 --> 481.98]  Concert or whatever
[481.98 --> 482.82]  Her phone
[482.82 --> 483.32]  Was the only
[483.32 --> 483.82]  One of ours
[483.82 --> 484.48]  That was even
[484.48 --> 485.22]  Remotely useful
[485.22 --> 486.70]  So having a
[486.70 --> 487.48]  Telephoto lens
[487.48 --> 488.48]  When you need it
[488.48 --> 489.54]  Can be pretty nice
[489.54 --> 490.74]  Up to 30 hours
[490.74 --> 491.42]  Of video playback
[491.42 --> 492.16]  $800
[492.16 --> 494.50]  That's a lot of money
[494.50 --> 495.76]  It is a lot of money
[495.76 --> 496.38]  That's a lot of money
[496.38 --> 496.84]  Especially for a base model
[496.84 --> 498.08]  But it is the
[498.08 --> 498.94]  Current gen phone
[498.94 --> 500.26]  Which gets one more
[500.26 --> 501.46]  Year of product support
[501.46 --> 502.18]  Compared to if you
[502.18 --> 503.22]  Buy a last gen one
[503.22 --> 503.78]  For less
[503.78 --> 506.00]  And it's not more
[506.00 --> 506.64]  Than last year
[506.64 --> 508.36]  It's the same
[508.36 --> 509.14]  Starting price
[509.14 --> 509.98]  As last year
[509.98 --> 510.48]  But we get a
[510.48 --> 511.36]  120 hertz display
[511.36 --> 512.20]  We get more storage
[512.20 --> 514.80]  So I'm not even
[514.80 --> 516.62]  In a world
[516.62 --> 517.90]  Where basically
[517.90 --> 518.92]  Everything
[518.92 --> 520.42]  Is going up in price
[520.42 --> 523.80]  Yeah it's like
[523.80 --> 524.34]  The sequel to
[524.34 --> 524.90]  Waterworld
[524.90 --> 525.24]  It's just
[525.24 --> 526.26]  Inflation world
[526.26 --> 528.84]  Starring Kevin Costner
[528.84 --> 530.82]  Whose sense of
[530.82 --> 531.74]  Self-importance
[531.74 --> 532.70]  Has inflated at the
[532.70 --> 533.56]  Same level of
[533.56 --> 534.56]  As money
[534.56 --> 535.36]  Over the last
[535.36 --> 536.10]  30 years
[536.10 --> 538.06]  To be clear
[538.06 --> 538.70]  To be clear
[538.70 --> 540.12]  I don't hate
[540.12 --> 540.90]  Kevin Costner
[540.90 --> 541.60]  I just
[541.60 --> 543.36]  I just think he
[543.36 --> 544.76]  Seems to think
[544.76 --> 545.24]  He's a lot more
[545.24 --> 545.98]  Relevant than he is
[545.98 --> 546.38]  That's all
[546.38 --> 547.34]  I have no idea
[547.34 --> 548.76]  I would watch
[548.76 --> 550.94]  Waterworld 2
[550.94 --> 551.14]  Though
[551.14 --> 552.62]  He starred in
[552.62 --> 554.08]  One super
[554.08 --> 555.68]  Amazing film
[555.68 --> 556.76]  Dances with wolves
[556.76 --> 558.08]  That I watched
[558.08 --> 558.68]  As a child
[558.68 --> 559.58]  And didn't understand
[559.58 --> 560.46]  Because I was a kid
[560.46 --> 560.96]  Sure
[560.96 --> 561.72]  And then
[561.72 --> 563.80]  And then
[563.80 --> 564.62]  He was in that movie
[564.62 --> 565.56]  With Ashton Kutcher
[565.56 --> 566.54]  That I thought was
[566.54 --> 567.82]  Solidly okay
[567.82 --> 568.76]  What movie is that?
[569.22 --> 569.76]  I don't remember
[569.76 --> 570.70]  It involved like
[570.70 --> 571.64]  Rescuing people
[571.64 --> 572.36]  I think
[572.36 --> 573.38]  And a helicopter
[573.38 --> 574.74]  Can't remember
[574.74 --> 577.98]  Scrappy DP says
[577.98 --> 578.78]  He wants to own
[578.78 --> 579.34]  Montana
[579.34 --> 580.02]  That wouldn't
[580.02 --> 580.62]  That wouldn't even
[580.62 --> 581.80]  Necessarily surprise me
[581.80 --> 582.26]  That much
[582.26 --> 583.30]  The Guardian
[583.30 --> 583.76]  The Guardian
[583.76 --> 586.26]  Oh this guy
[586.26 --> 588.12]  Oh this guy
[588.12 --> 588.70]  He says about
[588.70 --> 589.28]  Kevin Costner
[589.28 --> 589.88]  How do you
[589.88 --> 590.82]  How do you
[590.82 --> 592.12]  How do you
[592.12 --> 592.64]  Avoid
[592.64 --> 593.90]  I think the people
[593.90 --> 594.98]  Genuinely want to know
[594.98 --> 596.24]  How do you avoid
[596.24 --> 597.54]  Knowing about celebrities
[597.54 --> 598.72]  I just
[598.72 --> 599.50]  Cause they're like
[599.50 --> 600.26]  They're everywhere
[600.26 --> 600.70]  I just don't care
[600.70 --> 601.80]  I just like
[601.80 --> 603.10]  Deeply don't care
[603.10 --> 604.10]  But they're everywhere
[604.10 --> 605.22]  I think that's why though
[605.22 --> 605.68]  Is I just
[605.68 --> 607.04]  I have a
[607.04 --> 609.16]  Rather intense level
[609.16 --> 610.14]  Of lack of care
[610.14 --> 611.26]  So I'll like
[611.26 --> 612.22]  Recognize her face
[612.22 --> 612.76]  A little bit
[612.76 --> 613.14]  Right
[613.14 --> 613.82]  But like
[613.82 --> 614.76]  Right so you know
[614.76 --> 615.52]  Which one is
[615.52 --> 616.26]  Kevin Costner
[616.26 --> 616.68]  Right you know
[616.68 --> 616.98]  Yeah
[616.98 --> 617.82]  So you know
[617.82 --> 618.52]  Who Ashton Kutcher
[618.52 --> 619.04]  Is then
[619.04 --> 620.84]  In the photo
[620.84 --> 621.94]  Yeah
[621.94 --> 623.46]  Oh man
[623.46 --> 623.94]  Anyway
[623.94 --> 624.64]  I forgot
[624.64 --> 625.40]  And then I was like
[625.40 --> 625.76]  Oh yeah
[625.76 --> 626.20]  This is
[626.20 --> 626.86]  He did the
[626.86 --> 627.42]  Like that
[627.42 --> 628.56]  That TV show
[628.56 --> 629.44]  That 70s show
[629.44 --> 629.76]  Or whatever
[629.76 --> 631.32]  He's on there right
[631.32 --> 632.04]  Yeah
[632.04 --> 632.46]  Yeah
[632.46 --> 633.76]  Him and the rapist
[633.76 --> 635.12]  The rapist
[635.12 --> 635.66]  Oh yeah
[635.66 --> 636.42]  You don't know about that
[636.42 --> 636.78]  No
[636.78 --> 637.36]  Yeah
[637.36 --> 637.72]  See
[637.72 --> 640.00]  Yeah it was a whole thing
[640.00 --> 640.82]  I don't follow
[640.82 --> 641.86]  Yeah don't worry about it
[641.86 --> 642.18]  Yep
[642.18 --> 642.88]  Um
[642.88 --> 644.48]  So
[644.48 --> 648.04]  The most controversial new iPhone
[648.04 --> 649.20]  Is of course
[649.20 --> 651.08]  The iPhone Air
[651.08 --> 654.86]  It uses the A19 Pro processor
[654.86 --> 656.30]  So it uses the same chip
[656.30 --> 658.24]  As the 17 Pro
[658.24 --> 660.80]  It has 12 gigs of RAM
[660.80 --> 662.34]  Like the 17 Pro
[662.34 --> 665.16]  It has a 6.5 inch display
[665.16 --> 666.52]  Which is kind of in between
[666.52 --> 667.66]  The 17 Pro
[667.66 --> 669.30]  And the 17 Pro Max
[669.30 --> 672.44]  But it does give up some things
[672.44 --> 675.06]  So it has a 48 megapixel
[675.06 --> 676.92]  Single main camera
[676.92 --> 678.40]  Rather than having multiple shooters
[678.40 --> 680.88]  It has the new C1X modem
[680.88 --> 682.46]  Which we don't know
[682.46 --> 684.30]  If that's giving something up
[684.30 --> 685.98]  Or gaining something
[685.98 --> 686.66]  Yeah we'll see
[686.66 --> 687.88]  If I had to guess
[687.88 --> 689.04]  I'd say that
[689.04 --> 691.90]  And I could 100% be wrong about this
[691.90 --> 692.74]  If I had to guess
[692.74 --> 694.56]  I'd say the C1X is super efficient
[694.56 --> 697.16]  But maybe compromises somewhere else
[697.16 --> 698.74]  Where the full size phones
[698.74 --> 699.98]  With their full size batteries
[699.98 --> 700.98]  Didn't need to
[700.98 --> 702.14]  I'd say if it was just raw better
[702.14 --> 703.32]  I feel like they would put it on other ones
[703.32 --> 704.22]  But I also feel like
[704.22 --> 704.92]  This is kind of like
[704.92 --> 705.88]  An experimental device
[705.88 --> 706.54]  To a certain degree
[706.54 --> 708.20]  It is eSIM only
[708.20 --> 709.32]  And only boasts
[709.32 --> 711.22]  27 hours of video playback
[711.22 --> 713.38]  Rather than 30 for the iPhone 17
[713.38 --> 715.20]  33 for the 17 Pro
[715.20 --> 716.32]  And a whopping
[716.32 --> 717.42]  39
[717.42 --> 719.26]  39 hours
[719.26 --> 722.30]  For the 17 Pro Max
[722.30 --> 724.70]  There are some extra benefits
[724.70 --> 725.36]  Maybe
[725.36 --> 727.32]  So this was something
[727.32 --> 729.54]  That is always fun
[729.54 --> 730.70]  To watch Apple do
[730.70 --> 732.04]  You remember when they went
[732.04 --> 733.66]  Unapologetically plastic
[733.66 --> 735.12]  And then they were like
[735.12 --> 735.72]  Actually
[735.72 --> 736.66]  F*** plastic
[736.66 --> 737.88]  Plastic's f***ing stupid
[737.88 --> 739.58]  Like immediately after that
[739.58 --> 741.20]  And just pretended that never happened
[741.20 --> 741.56]  Oh yeah
[741.56 --> 742.48]  Yeah you remember that
[742.48 --> 742.70]  Okay
[742.70 --> 744.22]  So do you remember
[744.22 --> 746.00]  How on their Pro models
[746.00 --> 747.94]  Apple leaned super hard
[747.94 --> 748.42]  Into
[748.42 --> 750.38]  Titanium
[750.38 --> 752.20]  iPhone's titanium
[752.20 --> 754.96]  You know
[754.96 --> 756.08]  Like they're titanium
[756.08 --> 758.58]  Yeah
[758.58 --> 759.18]  Okay
[759.18 --> 760.90]  So that happened
[760.90 --> 762.54]  And then
[762.54 --> 763.32]  And then
[763.32 --> 765.40]  The new iPhone 17 Pro
[765.40 --> 767.52]  And Pro Max came out
[767.52 --> 771.62]  It's a song
[771.62 --> 772.68]  Okay
[772.68 --> 774.06]  What song is that?
[774.10 --> 775.06]  It's called Titanium
[775.06 --> 776.02]  That makes sense
[776.02 --> 776.60]  To be honest
[776.60 --> 778.00]  David Guetta
[778.00 --> 778.60]  Or Guetta
[778.60 --> 779.52]  Or whatever it is
[779.52 --> 779.82]  See
[779.82 --> 780.84]  I don't know
[780.84 --> 781.36]  Like I just
[781.36 --> 782.08]  Okay
[782.08 --> 782.32]  But
[782.32 --> 783.72]  Let's back up again
[783.72 --> 785.82]  You see images
[785.82 --> 786.68]  And read words
[786.68 --> 786.90]  Right?
[786.96 --> 787.54]  Oh right
[787.54 --> 793.58]  Dyslexic
[793.58 --> 795.12]  See like
[795.12 --> 795.68]  I can't
[795.68 --> 797.52]  I can't not know
[797.52 --> 798.72]  What a song is called
[798.72 --> 799.84]  Or who it's by
[799.84 --> 800.50]  Because it just
[800.50 --> 801.72]  Like it shows up
[801.72 --> 802.66]  And I read it
[802.66 --> 803.46]  Okay
[803.46 --> 804.00]  But I just
[804.00 --> 804.88]  I don't think I've listened
[804.88 --> 805.58]  To that song
[805.58 --> 806.60]  I know some songs
[806.60 --> 807.08]  There's no way
[807.08 --> 808.24]  You've not heard this song
[808.24 --> 809.02]  There's
[809.02 --> 810.02]  There's actually
[810.02 --> 812.02]  It's completely impossible
[812.02 --> 813.94]  That you have never heard this song
[813.94 --> 815.06]  Hold on
[815.06 --> 815.14]  If you play it
[815.14 --> 816.28]  We're gonna get more ad
[816.28 --> 817.18]  It's worth it
[817.18 --> 817.60]  Than we did from you
[817.60 --> 818.36]  Talking about the guy
[818.36 --> 818.78]  It's worth it
[818.78 --> 819.60]  I don't even care
[819.60 --> 824.20]  Okay
[824.20 --> 824.42]  Yeah
[824.42 --> 825.18]  Well yeah
[825.18 --> 827.06]  Anyway
[827.06 --> 828.48]  Um
[828.48 --> 829.96]  What are we supposed to be talking about?
[829.96 --> 830.20]  Right
[830.20 --> 831.40]  You like all the like
[831.40 --> 832.56]  Top 40 slop stuff
[832.56 --> 833.84]  I don't listen to it that much
[833.84 --> 834.96]  You just called
[834.96 --> 835.76]  See a slop
[835.76 --> 837.16]  See ya
[837.16 --> 838.84]  That's extremely disrespectful
[838.84 --> 839.70]  Who's see ya?
[841.08 --> 842.44]  It doesn't matter
[842.44 --> 846.60]  She was the
[846.60 --> 847.26]  You know
[847.26 --> 848.52]  Song whatever
[848.52 --> 849.16]  Whatever
[849.16 --> 850.14]  On my little pony
[850.14 --> 851.32]  And she's great
[851.32 --> 852.04]  Okay
[852.04 --> 852.92]  I don't
[852.92 --> 853.42]  I don't remember
[853.42 --> 853.78]  Sure
[853.78 --> 855.20]  But she's on my little pony
[855.20 --> 855.54]  Anyway
[855.54 --> 856.68]  Um
[856.68 --> 859.48]  So the point
[859.48 --> 859.94]  Oh man
[859.94 --> 860.28]  Chat
[860.28 --> 861.04]  That you guys are
[861.04 --> 861.90]  You guys are rough
[861.90 --> 862.76]  Someone's like
[862.76 --> 864.10]  I loved see ya
[864.10 --> 864.82]  Loved her music
[864.82 --> 865.24]  Someone's like
[865.24 --> 866.12]  She's still alive
[866.12 --> 866.56]  Guys
[866.56 --> 867.34]  Okay
[867.34 --> 867.84]  You know what
[867.84 --> 868.30]  It's fine
[868.30 --> 869.56]  The point is that
[869.56 --> 871.40]  Apple leaned super heavily
[871.40 --> 872.48]  Into titanium
[872.48 --> 873.74]  For their marketing
[873.74 --> 875.12]  For their pro phones
[875.12 --> 875.86]  Yeah
[875.86 --> 876.70]  And then
[876.70 --> 877.88]  This time around
[877.88 --> 879.82]  They leaned super hard
[879.82 --> 880.48]  Into aluminum
[880.48 --> 882.26]  They were all like
[882.26 --> 883.00]  Dude
[883.00 --> 883.38]  Really
[883.38 --> 884.18]  Aluminum
[884.18 --> 885.90]  Has so much
[885.90 --> 886.68]  Thermal
[886.68 --> 887.56]  Performance
[887.56 --> 888.62]  It's like
[888.62 --> 889.92]  So much better
[889.92 --> 890.84]  Than titanium
[890.84 --> 891.90]  Aluminum
[891.90 --> 892.44]  Is great
[892.44 --> 893.74]  You guys are gonna love it
[893.74 --> 894.94]  Aluminum
[894.94 --> 895.76]  Interesting
[895.76 --> 896.56]  Oh by the way
[896.56 --> 896.58]  Oh by the way
[896.58 --> 897.24]  On the iPhone
[897.24 --> 897.64]  Air
[897.64 --> 898.36]  It's titanium
[898.36 --> 899.32]  I was just gonna say
[899.32 --> 900.18]  The air is titanium
[900.18 --> 900.88]  And I'm just
[900.88 --> 901.88]  I'm kinda sitting here
[901.88 --> 902.42]  Going like
[902.42 --> 906.28]  Can Apple just
[906.28 --> 907.24]  Can they just
[907.24 --> 908.58]  Can they get some
[908.58 --> 909.54]  Consistency
[909.54 --> 911.70]  Can they please
[911.70 --> 913.50]  Get some consistency
[913.50 --> 915.14]  In their marketing
[915.14 --> 916.20]  For these materials
[916.20 --> 917.42]  Can you just
[917.42 --> 918.72]  Can you just say
[918.72 --> 920.38]  We put titanium
[920.38 --> 921.52]  On the pro phones
[921.52 --> 921.98]  Before
[921.98 --> 923.08]  Cause it's really
[923.08 --> 924.40]  Shiny and hard
[924.40 --> 926.04]  Glistening even
[926.04 --> 926.68]  You might say
[926.68 --> 927.78]  Right
[927.78 --> 929.02]  And then
[929.02 --> 930.06]  Can you just say
[930.06 --> 931.10]  You know
[931.10 --> 932.34]  Aluminum's still good
[932.34 --> 933.40]  Like
[933.40 --> 934.26]  That would've been
[934.26 --> 934.82]  Fine too
[934.82 --> 935.68]  But this titanium
[935.68 --> 937.24]  It has a nice finish
[937.24 --> 937.96]  And it's super shiny
[937.96 --> 938.18]  Like
[938.18 --> 939.62]  If you just told us
[939.62 --> 940.48]  Exactly what it was
[940.48 --> 941.36]  It looks awesome
[941.36 --> 942.16]  And you didn't
[942.16 --> 942.94]  Wank it off
[942.94 --> 944.40]  So hard
[944.40 --> 945.62]  In the first place
[945.62 --> 946.56]  Then it wouldn't be
[946.56 --> 947.52]  So embarrassing
[947.52 --> 948.84]  Every time you have
[948.84 --> 949.58]  To backtrack
[949.58 --> 950.42]  And use a different
[950.42 --> 950.94]  Material
[950.94 --> 953.32]  So yeah
[953.32 --> 954.62]  The iPhone air
[954.62 --> 955.46]  Uses titanium
[955.46 --> 956.26]  Presumably because
[956.26 --> 957.12]  It is so
[957.12 --> 958.26]  Flipping thin
[958.26 --> 958.78]  I don't know
[958.78 --> 959.22]  Whoops
[959.22 --> 960.42]  How it's even
[960.42 --> 961.18]  Possible that
[961.18 --> 962.18]  My notes don't
[962.18 --> 962.74]  Include the thickness
[962.74 --> 963.22]  I believe it's
[963.22 --> 964.52]  5.4 millimeters
[964.52 --> 964.88]  Though
[964.88 --> 970.64]  5.64 millimeters
[970.64 --> 972.22]  That
[972.22 --> 973.20]  Is
[973.20 --> 974.94]  Nuts
[974.94 --> 975.80]  That is wild
[975.80 --> 976.78]  That is like
[976.78 --> 978.86]  I can't wait
[978.86 --> 980.08]  To get it in my hands
[980.08 --> 981.18]  Finally I'll have
[981.18 --> 981.70]  A phone that fits
[981.70 --> 982.34]  Does it feel whack
[982.34 --> 982.86]  That it has an
[982.86 --> 983.86]  Enormous camera bump
[983.86 --> 984.70]  That's like thicker
[984.70 --> 985.28]  Than the phone
[985.28 --> 985.76]  Um
[985.76 --> 987.62]  I mean
[987.62 --> 988.74]  It's no different
[988.74 --> 989.68]  Yes
[989.68 --> 990.32]  Yes
[990.32 --> 992.02]  And I can see
[992.02 --> 992.64]  Why it's a
[992.64 --> 993.46]  Controversial device
[993.46 --> 994.12]  I can see why
[994.12 --> 995.00]  It's really polarizing
[995.00 --> 996.54]  But I do think
[996.54 --> 997.30]  That there are
[997.30 --> 998.10]  Going to be people
[998.10 --> 999.10]  That it appeals to
[999.10 --> 999.94]  And I'm
[999.94 --> 1000.62]  I'm excited
[1000.62 --> 1001.48]  Just to sort of
[1001.48 --> 1002.40]  Marvel at the thinness
[1002.40 --> 1004.18]  It looks super cool
[1004.18 --> 1005.00]  I mean
[1005.00 --> 1005.42]  It's not
[1005.42 --> 1006.42]  Of some of the phone
[1006.42 --> 1007.74]  Yes
[1007.74 --> 1009.52]  Yes
[1009.52 --> 1010.18]  That's fair
[1010.18 --> 1010.90]  Why don't they just make
[1010.90 --> 1011.62]  Like half of it
[1011.62 --> 1012.40]  Two mils thick
[1012.40 --> 1012.88]  And go like
[1012.88 --> 1013.90]  World's finest phone
[1013.90 --> 1014.76]  And then most of it
[1014.76 --> 1015.86]  Is just that big
[1015.86 --> 1016.56]  Why don't you just
[1016.56 --> 1017.22]  Join the podcast
[1017.22 --> 1018.10]  If you're gonna talk
[1018.10 --> 1018.62]  All the time
[1018.62 --> 1020.50]  Shut up
[1020.50 --> 1024.44]  Technically that's not
[1024.44 --> 1024.88]  What I said
[1024.88 --> 1026.38]  Technically I invited him
[1026.38 --> 1027.24]  To join the podcast
[1027.24 --> 1028.28]  Let the record show
[1028.28 --> 1029.62]  You did so aggressively though
[1029.62 --> 1030.80]  It wasn't very inviting
[1030.80 --> 1031.58]  That's just how I talk
[1031.58 --> 1031.98]  To people
[1031.98 --> 1032.58]  You invited someone
[1032.58 --> 1032.96]  It's true
[1032.96 --> 1033.92]  Look I really like
[1033.92 --> 1034.86]  Being friends with you
[1034.86 --> 1037.98]  I do believe that
[1037.98 --> 1041.14]  It's something I value
[1041.14 --> 1049.16]  Come over tomorrow
[1049.16 --> 1049.78]  Okay
[1049.78 --> 1054.86]  So where were we
[1054.86 --> 1055.66]  Okay I'm excited
[1055.66 --> 1056.40]  To check it out
[1056.40 --> 1057.94]  I'm a little less
[1057.94 --> 1058.74]  Excited about the
[1058.74 --> 1060.60]  17 Pro
[1060.60 --> 1061.78]  And the 17 Pro Max
[1061.78 --> 1062.86]  But
[1062.86 --> 1064.22]  They are far from
[1064.22 --> 1065.10]  The biggest disappointment
[1065.10 --> 1066.04]  I think the biggest
[1066.04 --> 1067.04]  Disappointment
[1067.04 --> 1069.38]  Sort of broadly
[1069.38 --> 1070.22]  In the tech community
[1070.22 --> 1071.22]  Is where
[1071.22 --> 1072.44]  The fuck is a
[1072.44 --> 1073.56]  Replacement for the mini
[1073.56 --> 1075.24]  We haven't gotten
[1075.24 --> 1075.90]  A new mini since
[1075.90 --> 1076.36]  What was it
[1076.36 --> 1077.32]  12 or 13
[1077.32 --> 1078.30]  Dan do you remember
[1078.30 --> 1079.40]  Does anyone know
[1079.40 --> 1080.38]  Let me know in the chat
[1080.38 --> 1081.12]  I believe it was either
[1081.12 --> 1082.20]  iPhone 12 or 13
[1082.20 --> 1082.76]  Generation
[1082.76 --> 1083.16]  13
[1083.16 --> 1084.66]  So it's been
[1084.66 --> 1085.96]  Four freaking years
[1085.96 --> 1087.44]  People who are
[1087.44 --> 1088.24]  Still rocking minis
[1088.24 --> 1088.44]  Like
[1088.44 --> 1089.70]  Andrew in the camera
[1089.70 --> 1090.16]  Department
[1090.16 --> 1091.26]  Loves his mini
[1091.26 --> 1091.96]  And he's just like
[1091.96 --> 1092.22]  Yep
[1092.22 --> 1093.98]  It's getting a little
[1093.98 --> 1094.82]  Long in the tooth
[1094.82 --> 1097.24]  Anytime now Apple
[1097.24 --> 1098.48]  Give me a new mini
[1098.48 --> 1099.80]  And personally
[1099.80 --> 1100.82]  Even though
[1100.82 --> 1101.46]  That one
[1101.46 --> 1102.68]  Is sort of
[1102.68 --> 1103.26]  More broadly
[1103.26 --> 1103.98]  Upsetting to people
[1103.98 --> 1105.22]  I'm actually bummed
[1105.22 --> 1106.34]  That the iPhone 17
[1106.34 --> 1107.40]  Plus isn't a thing
[1107.40 --> 1108.78]  Because I thought
[1108.78 --> 1109.58]  The 16 plus
[1109.58 --> 1111.46]  Was a great middle ground
[1111.46 --> 1112.38]  It gave me the bigger
[1112.38 --> 1113.94]  Screen that I wanted
[1113.94 --> 1115.40]  But it didn't give me
[1115.40 --> 1116.00]  Any of the
[1116.00 --> 1117.40]  Paying a couple hundred
[1117.40 --> 1118.74]  U.S. extra dollars
[1118.74 --> 1119.54]  For things that I don't
[1119.54 --> 1120.22]  Really need
[1120.22 --> 1121.40]  That the Pro had
[1121.40 --> 1122.58]  So if there was a
[1122.58 --> 1124.18]  17 plus
[1124.18 --> 1125.80]  That would honestly
[1125.80 --> 1126.36]  Be the one that
[1126.36 --> 1127.16]  I would be most
[1127.16 --> 1127.84]  Interested in this
[1127.84 --> 1128.14]  Generation
[1128.14 --> 1129.00]  Especially now that
[1129.00 --> 1130.08]  It has 120 hertz
[1130.08 --> 1130.72]  Refresh rate
[1130.72 --> 1133.00]  And yeah
[1133.00 --> 1134.26]  That's probably
[1134.26 --> 1134.74]  The only thing
[1134.74 --> 1135.60]  That I was really
[1135.60 --> 1136.40]  Missing out on
[1136.40 --> 1137.84]  With the 16 plus
[1137.84 --> 1138.56]  When I did my
[1138.56 --> 1139.44]  Daily driver challenge
[1139.44 --> 1140.26]  So we're actually
[1140.26 --> 1141.00]  Going to mix up
[1141.00 --> 1141.72]  The daily driver
[1141.72 --> 1142.44]  Challenge this time
[1142.44 --> 1142.68]  Around
[1142.68 --> 1144.06]  The title of
[1144.06 --> 1144.72]  WAN show today
[1144.72 --> 1145.66]  Is I bought my
[1145.66 --> 1146.54]  iPhone and I did
[1146.54 --> 1147.44]  But I bought all
[1147.44 --> 1147.76]  Three
[1147.76 --> 1148.86]  And so what I'm
[1148.86 --> 1149.34]  Going to do
[1149.34 --> 1150.18]  Is I'm going to
[1150.18 --> 1151.42]  Use all the
[1151.42 --> 1152.96]  Pockets in our
[1152.96 --> 1153.68]  Awesome cargo
[1153.68 --> 1154.22]  Pants from
[1154.22 --> 1155.40]  LTTstore.com
[1155.40 --> 1156.80]  And I'm going to
[1156.80 --> 1157.32]  Carry them all
[1157.32 --> 1158.64]  And I'm going to
[1158.64 --> 1159.62]  See which one
[1159.62 --> 1160.90]  I gravitate toward
[1160.90 --> 1161.92]  Can you like
[1161.92 --> 1163.20]  So we'll do all
[1163.20 --> 1164.06]  The unboxings on
[1164.06 --> 1164.58]  Short circuit
[1164.58 --> 1165.62]  And then basically
[1165.62 --> 1166.28]  I'm going to see
[1166.28 --> 1167.14]  Which one do I
[1167.14 --> 1168.60]  Actually enjoy
[1168.60 --> 1169.62]  Using the most
[1169.62 --> 1171.12]  Interesting
[1171.12 --> 1171.86]  Yeah
[1171.86 --> 1173.42]  Because I literally
[1173.42 --> 1174.20]  Don't know
[1174.20 --> 1175.58]  I don't know
[1175.58 --> 1177.42]  If the air
[1177.42 --> 1178.26]  Is going to
[1178.26 --> 1179.08]  Entice me
[1179.08 --> 1179.88]  Could you
[1179.88 --> 1181.00]  Dupe your sim
[1181.00 --> 1182.88]  Okay
[1182.88 --> 1183.66]  So the air
[1183.66 --> 1184.32]  Is e-sim only
[1184.32 --> 1184.96]  That's interesting
[1184.96 --> 1186.24]  So theoretically
[1186.24 --> 1187.38]  I believe yes
[1187.38 --> 1189.16]  But generally
[1189.16 --> 1189.68]  Speaking
[1189.68 --> 1190.62]  I use
[1190.62 --> 1192.08]  I use my
[1192.08 --> 1193.16]  Cellular connection
[1193.16 --> 1194.62]  Almost not at all
[1194.62 --> 1195.74]  And what I've been
[1195.74 --> 1196.24]  Doing over the
[1196.24 --> 1197.10]  Last little while
[1197.10 --> 1198.00]  Actually because
[1198.00 --> 1198.92]  Just hospital
[1198.92 --> 1199.76]  Like crazy
[1199.76 --> 1200.26]  I've had
[1200.26 --> 1201.10]  I've had more
[1201.10 --> 1201.56]  Issues with
[1201.56 --> 1202.36]  Graphene OS
[1202.36 --> 1203.90]  Okay
[1203.90 --> 1204.84]  That doesn't mean
[1204.84 --> 1205.40]  That you shouldn't
[1205.40 --> 1205.80]  Use it
[1205.80 --> 1206.22]  Okay
[1206.22 --> 1207.12]  It just means
[1207.12 --> 1207.92]  That I think
[1207.92 --> 1208.56]  I'm done with it
[1208.56 --> 1210.14]  I might be
[1210.14 --> 1210.72]  Kind of screwed
[1210.72 --> 1211.10]  Anyways
[1211.10 --> 1211.68]  I've been trying
[1211.68 --> 1212.30]  To diagnose it
[1212.30 --> 1212.64]  Over the last
[1212.64 --> 1213.04]  Couple days
[1213.04 --> 1213.46]  The
[1213.46 --> 1214.24]  Well I mean
[1214.24 --> 1214.94]  I might be able
[1214.94 --> 1215.70]  To just repair it
[1215.70 --> 1216.04]  I don't know
[1216.04 --> 1216.92]  But the USB port
[1216.92 --> 1217.34]  On my phone
[1217.34 --> 1217.86]  Might be like
[1217.86 --> 1219.12]  Super dying
[1219.12 --> 1219.74]  Bummer
[1219.74 --> 1220.20]  Yeah
[1220.20 --> 1220.86]  I mean
[1220.86 --> 1221.58]  Do you need it
[1221.58 --> 1223.02]  Wireless charging
[1223.02 --> 1223.90]  Oh
[1223.90 --> 1225.00]  Like
[1225.00 --> 1226.18]  I don't know
[1226.18 --> 1227.36]  I have literally
[1227.36 --> 1228.28]  Zero of those
[1228.28 --> 1229.30]  I mean
[1229.30 --> 1230.04]  I could get some
[1230.04 --> 1232.40]  There's this thing
[1232.40 --> 1233.62]  I could join the new age
[1233.62 --> 1234.46]  It can be exchanged
[1234.46 --> 1235.44]  For goods and services
[1235.44 --> 1236.08]  Like it's
[1236.08 --> 1237.18]  I'd prefer to not
[1237.18 --> 1237.74]  Yeah I know
[1237.74 --> 1239.66]  I know
[1239.66 --> 1240.84]  Oh my god
[1240.84 --> 1242.28]  Do you know how many
[1242.28 --> 1243.32]  People think that you
[1243.32 --> 1244.80]  Are like destitutely poor
[1244.80 --> 1245.42]  Oh I'm good
[1245.42 --> 1246.32]  Because of
[1246.32 --> 1246.90]  Like
[1246.90 --> 1247.48]  The way
[1247.48 --> 1248.24]  I'm doing fine
[1248.24 --> 1248.86]  I know
[1248.86 --> 1250.04]  I know
[1250.04 --> 1251.58]  They don't
[1251.58 --> 1254.16]  Any
[1254.16 --> 1254.56]  I don't
[1254.56 --> 1254.92]  I don't
[1254.92 --> 1255.56]  Mind plugging
[1255.56 --> 1256.08]  Something in
[1256.08 --> 1256.38]  I don't
[1256.38 --> 1256.54]  Know
[1256.54 --> 1256.76]  I
[1256.76 --> 1257.08]  That's
[1257.08 --> 1257.72]  I don't
[1257.72 --> 1258.20]  This doesn't
[1258.20 --> 1258.70]  Feel like
[1258.70 --> 1259.34]  Me neither
[1259.34 --> 1260.08]  I actually
[1260.08 --> 1260.64]  I actually
[1260.64 --> 1261.02]  Plug in
[1261.02 --> 1261.16]  Every
[1261.16 --> 1261.38]  Yeah
[1261.38 --> 1262.12]  Like I don't
[1262.12 --> 1262.84]  I don't
[1262.84 --> 1263.06]  Know
[1263.06 --> 1263.76]  I do
[1263.76 --> 1264.40]  Find
[1264.40 --> 1268.90]  Some of
[1268.90 --> 1269.22]  The like
[1269.22 --> 1269.72]  Mag
[1269.72 --> 1270.36]  What is the
[1270.36 --> 1270.76]  Name of it
[1270.76 --> 1271.84]  On Android
[1271.84 --> 1272.48]  Because Mag
[1272.48 --> 1273.12]  Safe for
[1273.12 --> 1273.88]  iPhone right
[1273.88 --> 1274.42]  Yeah I don't
[1274.42 --> 1274.54]  Know
[1274.54 --> 1275.28]  Whatever the
[1275.28 --> 1275.78]  Magnetic
[1275.78 --> 1276.18]  One is
[1276.18 --> 1277.36]  For sure
[1277.36 --> 1277.74]  Pixel
[1277.74 --> 1278.06]  Snap
[1278.06 --> 1278.46]  I think
[1278.46 --> 1279.22]  That is kind
[1279.22 --> 1279.70]  Of neat
[1279.70 --> 1280.42]  In some
[1280.42 --> 1281.32]  Applications
[1281.32 --> 1281.90]  Yeah it is
[1281.90 --> 1282.48]  I could see
[1282.48 --> 1282.90]  That but
[1282.90 --> 1283.24]  It's great
[1283.24 --> 1283.66]  For the car
[1283.66 --> 1284.90]  Yes but
[1284.90 --> 1285.60]  Almost nowhere
[1285.60 --> 1286.16]  That I would
[1286.16 --> 1287.00]  Actually have
[1287.00 --> 1287.56]  My phone
[1287.56 --> 1288.22]  Yeah
[1288.22 --> 1289.74]  So like I
[1289.74 --> 1290.10]  Haven't really
[1290.10 --> 1290.42]  Cared
[1290.42 --> 1290.98]  Because I'm
[1290.98 --> 1291.48]  Going to sleep
[1291.48 --> 1292.00]  I can plug
[1292.00 --> 1292.50]  My phone in
[1292.50 --> 1292.90]  It's really
[1292.90 --> 1293.32]  Not a big
[1293.32 --> 1293.44]  Deal
[1293.44 --> 1294.24]  Honestly I'm
[1294.24 --> 1294.58]  The same
[1294.58 --> 1295.98]  Like Apple
[1295.98 --> 1297.34]  Like so many
[1297.34 --> 1298.26]  Of the sort
[1298.26 --> 1298.80]  Of the Apple
[1298.80 --> 1300.26]  User reasons
[1300.26 --> 1301.18]  Why I should
[1301.18 --> 1301.98]  Accept nothing
[1301.98 --> 1302.54]  Less than an
[1302.54 --> 1302.90]  iPhone
[1302.90 --> 1303.80]  They don't
[1303.80 --> 1304.44]  Resonate with
[1304.44 --> 1305.14]  Me and Mag
[1305.14 --> 1305.58]  Safe is
[1305.58 --> 1306.24]  Definitely one
[1306.24 --> 1306.50]  Of them
[1306.50 --> 1307.40]  I have Android
[1307.40 --> 1307.76]  Auto and
[1307.76 --> 1308.08]  CarPlay
[1308.08 --> 1308.36]  In my
[1308.36 --> 1308.60]  Car
[1308.60 --> 1309.42]  So I
[1309.42 --> 1310.76]  Just put
[1310.76 --> 1311.18]  My phone
[1311.18 --> 1311.62]  Down or
[1311.62 --> 1311.88]  I just
[1311.88 --> 1312.22]  Leave it
[1312.22 --> 1312.44]  In my
[1312.44 --> 1312.74]  Pocket
[1312.74 --> 1313.32]  It's
[1313.32 --> 1313.66]  Wireless
[1313.66 --> 1314.50]  In both
[1314.50 --> 1314.74]  Of our
[1314.74 --> 1315.06]  Family
[1315.06 --> 1316.24]  Vehicles
[1316.24 --> 1317.12]  Now so
[1317.12 --> 1317.54]  I don't
[1317.54 --> 1317.92]  Need to
[1317.92 --> 1318.26]  Charge my
[1318.26 --> 1318.50]  Car
[1318.50 --> 1319.94]  Man battery
[1319.94 --> 1320.78]  Life on
[1320.78 --> 1321.14]  The Pixel
[1321.14 --> 1322.12]  9a and
[1322.12 --> 1322.36]  On the
[1322.36 --> 1322.60]  Latest
[1322.60 --> 1323.60]  iPhones is
[1323.60 --> 1324.62]  Like so
[1324.62 --> 1324.94]  Good I'm
[1324.94 --> 1326.08]  At 75%
[1326.08 --> 1326.52]  Pixel
[1326.52 --> 1326.94]  Yeah
[1326.94 --> 1328.26]  The 9a
[1328.26 --> 1329.32]  Specifically has
[1329.32 --> 1330.42]  Just flipping
[1330.42 --> 1330.90]  Outstanding
[1330.90 --> 1331.50]  Battery life
[1331.50 --> 1331.92]  I've heard
[1331.92 --> 1332.84]  Great things
[1332.84 --> 1333.30]  About the
[1333.30 --> 1333.96]  9a
[1333.96 --> 1334.50]  Specifically
[1334.50 --> 1335.26]  From like
[1335.26 --> 1335.78]  A ton
[1335.78 --> 1336.26]  Of people
[1336.26 --> 1338.34]  It is
[1338.34 --> 1338.60]  Not a
[1338.60 --> 1338.82]  Perfect
[1338.82 --> 1339.24]  Phone
[1339.24 --> 1339.68]  No
[1339.68 --> 1340.08]  But the
[1340.08 --> 1340.62]  Battery life
[1340.62 --> 1341.90]  Is great
[1341.90 --> 1343.00]  It's outstanding
[1343.00 --> 1343.68]  Best I've ever
[1343.68 --> 1344.10]  Seen on an
[1344.10 --> 1344.38]  Android
[1344.38 --> 1345.18]  Okay what are
[1345.18 --> 1345.90]  Your downsides
[1345.90 --> 1346.34]  Because that's
[1346.34 --> 1346.98]  I care about
[1346.98 --> 1347.48]  Very little
[1347.48 --> 1348.48]  Battery life
[1348.48 --> 1349.42]  It's just kind
[1349.42 --> 1350.22]  Of a
[1350.22 --> 1350.88]  Butthead
[1350.88 --> 1351.60]  Sometimes
[1351.60 --> 1352.00]  It's just
[1352.00 --> 1352.22]  Kind of
[1352.22 --> 1352.88]  Like dumb
[1352.88 --> 1353.40]  Sometimes
[1353.40 --> 1354.10]  Is that
[1354.10 --> 1354.50]  Just a
[1354.50 --> 1355.00]  Pixel
[1355.00 --> 1355.14]  Problem
[1355.14 --> 1356.60]  I held
[1356.60 --> 1357.04]  Down for
[1357.04 --> 1357.48]  Voice and
[1357.48 --> 1357.70]  It's like
[1357.70 --> 1358.04]  Oops something
[1358.04 --> 1358.50]  Went wrong
[1358.50 --> 1359.94]  And it's like
[1359.94 --> 1360.68]  Why
[1360.68 --> 1361.48]  Why do you
[1361.48 --> 1362.24]  Just randomly
[1362.24 --> 1362.94]  Do that a lot
[1362.94 --> 1363.38]  Of the time
[1363.38 --> 1364.12]  It's just
[1364.12 --> 1365.64]  Not perfect
[1365.64 --> 1366.34]  That's all
[1366.34 --> 1367.22]  And whenever
[1367.22 --> 1367.80]  I'm recommending
[1367.80 --> 1368.40]  It might just
[1368.40 --> 1369.26]  Be pixel issues
[1369.26 --> 1370.12]  Well it might
[1370.12 --> 1370.66]  Be it might
[1370.66 --> 1371.20]  Also be that
[1371.20 --> 1371.56]  I'm using
[1371.56 --> 1372.14]  Swiftkey
[1372.14 --> 1373.90]  And you know
[1373.90 --> 1374.46]  Someone
[1374.46 --> 1375.70]  No one at
[1375.70 --> 1376.22]  Any point
[1376.22 --> 1377.44]  Ever tried
[1377.44 --> 1377.98]  Swiftkey
[1377.98 --> 1378.28]  On a
[1378.28 --> 1378.54]  Pixel
[1378.54 --> 1379.40]  And noticed
[1379.40 --> 1379.82]  Oh hey
[1379.82 --> 1380.32]  This doesn't
[1380.32 --> 1380.66]  Work we
[1380.66 --> 1381.20]  Should probably
[1381.20 --> 1381.62]  Work with
[1381.62 --> 1382.12]  Our partner
[1382.12 --> 1382.96]  Microsoft
[1382.96 --> 1383.70]  And or
[1383.70 --> 1384.28]  Google to
[1384.28 --> 1384.86]  Address it
[1384.86 --> 1386.20]  Like whatever
[1386.20 --> 1388.12]  So I just
[1388.12 --> 1389.18]  It's not
[1389.18 --> 1390.04]  Perfect I do
[1390.04 --> 1390.36]  Get some
[1390.36 --> 1390.96]  Buggy behavior
[1390.96 --> 1391.82]  So make of
[1391.82 --> 1392.20]  That what you
[1392.20 --> 1392.60]  Will but the
[1392.60 --> 1393.20]  Battery life is
[1393.20 --> 1394.48]  Great back to
[1394.48 --> 1395.08]  Graphene OS
[1395.08 --> 1395.76]  For a second
[1395.76 --> 1400.90]  I just
[1400.90 --> 1404.02]  It's really
[1404.02 --> 1405.52]  Cool and
[1405.52 --> 1406.54]  My god
[1406.54 --> 1406.98]  Is it ever
[1406.98 --> 1407.50]  Snappy
[1407.50 --> 1408.74]  Like it's
[1408.74 --> 1409.76]  So responsive
[1409.76 --> 1411.02]  Battery life
[1411.02 --> 1412.40]  Also outstanding
[1412.40 --> 1413.56]  Like this is
[1413.56 --> 1413.90]  The one I've
[1413.90 --> 1414.46]  Got my sim
[1414.46 --> 1414.98]  In right now
[1414.98 --> 1415.42]  And it's at
[1415.42 --> 1416.90]  99%
[1416.90 --> 1417.72]  Today
[1417.72 --> 1419.16]  And I have
[1419.16 --> 1420.00]  I have used
[1420.00 --> 1420.34]  It today
[1420.34 --> 1421.02]  But very little
[1421.02 --> 1422.32]  But I have
[1422.32 --> 1422.80]  Used it
[1422.80 --> 1423.32]  And it's like
[1423.32 --> 1424.38]  Just it just
[1424.38 --> 1424.90]  At idle
[1424.90 --> 1425.24]  It like
[1425.24 --> 1425.74]  Sips
[1425.74 --> 1426.26]  Power
[1426.26 --> 1428.42]  It's just
[1428.42 --> 1429.82]  It's everything
[1429.82 --> 1430.58]  That a pixel
[1430.58 --> 1431.72]  Already was
[1431.72 --> 1432.16]  But like
[1432.16 --> 1432.50]  It's more
[1432.50 --> 1433.10]  Secure
[1433.10 --> 1434.68]  And it's
[1434.68 --> 1435.82]  And it's
[1435.82 --> 1436.10]  Kind of
[1436.10 --> 1436.84]  Snappier
[1436.84 --> 1437.20]  And more
[1437.20 --> 1438.06]  Responsive
[1438.06 --> 1439.90]  It's just
[1439.90 --> 1441.28]  That when
[1441.28 --> 1441.72]  You go to
[1441.72 --> 1442.26]  Do something
[1442.26 --> 1442.90]  New that
[1442.90 --> 1443.26]  You haven't
[1443.26 --> 1443.82]  Done before
[1443.82 --> 1444.88]  Like say
[1444.88 --> 1445.58]  For example
[1445.58 --> 1446.42]  Same thing
[1446.42 --> 1447.60]  If I wanted
[1447.60 --> 1448.58]  To use
[1448.58 --> 1449.48]  Voice dictation
[1449.48 --> 1449.84]  In order
[1449.84 --> 1450.62]  To do
[1450.62 --> 1451.02]  Something
[1451.02 --> 1452.04]  I might
[1452.04 --> 1452.56]  Have to
[1452.56 --> 1453.06]  Hold this
[1453.06 --> 1453.38]  Button
[1453.38 --> 1454.02]  Where it
[1454.02 --> 1454.44]  Will say
[1454.44 --> 1455.42]  Voice typing
[1455.42 --> 1456.20]  To use
[1456.20 --> 1456.68]  Voice input
[1456.68 --> 1457.02]  You must
[1457.02 --> 1457.28]  Download
[1457.28 --> 1457.72]  And install
[1457.72 --> 1458.28]  Google voice
[1458.28 --> 1458.62]  Search
[1458.62 --> 1459.44]  Download
[1459.44 --> 1460.18]  It takes
[1460.18 --> 1460.64]  Me to

[1462.96 --> 1464.64]  And it's
[1464.64 --> 1465.48]  Installed
[1465.48 --> 1466.12]  So I
[1466.12 --> 1466.60]  Click
[1466.60 --> 1467.96]  I don't

[1480.92 --> 1481.32]  Could solve
[1481.32 --> 1481.56]  This
[1481.56 --> 1481.94]  I'm sure
[1481.94 --> 1482.20]  I could
[1482.20 --> 1482.46]  Solve
[1482.46 --> 1482.66]  This
[1482.66 --> 1482.88]  I mean
[1482.88 --> 1483.54]  I have
[1483.54 --> 1484.28]  A graphene

[1485.96 --> 1486.42]  That I
[1486.42 --> 1487.46]  I can't
[1487.46 --> 1489.06]  I probably
[1489.06 --> 1489.46]  Will

[1490.02 --> 1490.38]  To solve
[1490.38 --> 1490.70]  This
[1490.70 --> 1491.62]  But
[1491.62 --> 1492.86]  It takes
[1492.86 --> 1493.28]  A special
[1493.28 --> 1493.72]  Sort of
[1493.72 --> 1494.14]  Person

[1497.98 --> 1498.32]  That
[1498.32 --> 1498.90]  Instead of
[1498.90 --> 1499.14]  Just
[1499.14 --> 1499.92]  Using their

[1506.64 --> 1507.98]  I don't
[1507.98 --> 1508.38]  Think I
[1508.38 --> 1508.70]  Am

[1509.70 --> 1510.22]  At least
[1510.22 --> 1510.74]  Not right
[1510.74 --> 1511.10]  Now
[1511.10 --> 1512.12]  And
[1512.12 --> 1513.72]  For me
[1513.72 --> 1514.22]  Where
[1514.22 --> 1515.10]  My privacy
[1515.10 --> 1515.74]  Is quite

[1530.06 --> 1530.24]  It
[1530.24 --> 1530.46]  Right
[1530.46 --> 1530.68]  Now

[1720.76 --> 1720.98]  It's
[1720.98 --> 1721.08]  An

[1779.46 --> 1779.68]  Just
[1779.68 --> 1779.88]  Trying

[1780.68 --> 1780.98]  Cool
[1780.98 --> 1781.66]  Or
[1781.66 --> 1782.04]  Something

[1784.20 --> 1784.38]  Here
[1784.38 --> 1784.66]  But
[1784.66 --> 1785.76]  Maybe
[1785.76 --> 1786.00]  And
[1786.00 --> 1786.18]  Maybe
[1786.18 --> 1786.40]  There
[1786.40 --> 1786.54]  Is
[1786.54 --> 1786.62]  A
[1786.62 --> 1786.72]  Way
[1786.72 --> 1786.84]  To

[1787.70 --> 1787.82]  I
[1787.82 --> 1787.96]  Would
[1787.96 --> 1788.30]  Really
[1788.30 --> 1789.48]  Rather

[1792.28 --> 1792.56]  Color
[1792.56 --> 1793.18]  And

[1810.70 --> 1810.86]  Yeah
[1810.86 --> 1810.96]  It's
[1810.96 --> 1811.14]  Really

[1849.18 --> 1849.42]  Explain
[1849.42 --> 1849.64]  Why
[1849.64 --> 1849.84]  After

[1871.88 --> 1873.18]  So
[1873.18 --> 1873.98]  What
[1873.98 --> 1874.56]  2x
[1874.56 --> 1874.94]  Means

[1954.44 --> 1954.88]  Literally
[1954.88 --> 1955.24]  Nobody
[1955.24 --> 1955.68]  Agrees
[1955.68 --> 1955.82]  With
[1955.82 --> 1956.62]  Legitimately
[1956.62 --> 1956.96]  Stay
[1956.96 --> 1957.20]  There
[1957.20 --> 1957.50]  They
[1957.50 --> 1957.86]  Love
[1957.86 --> 1958.82]  They
[1958.82 --> 1959.14]  Love
[1959.14 --> 1959.50]  Siding
[1959.50 --> 1959.72]  With
[1959.72 --> 1959.90]  You
[1959.90 --> 1960.22]  Instead
[1960.22 --> 1960.40]  Of
[1960.40 --> 1960.62]  Me
[1960.62 --> 1960.84]  But
[1960.84 --> 1961.04]  This
[1961.04 --> 1961.16]  Is
[1961.16 --> 1961.30]  A
[1961.30 --> 1961.48]  Step
[1961.48 --> 1961.68]  Too
[1961.68 --> 1961.94]  Far
[1961.94 --> 1963.56]  They
[1963.56 --> 1963.98]  Will
[1963.98 --> 1964.26]  Stay
[1969.88 --> 1969.98]  He
[1969.98 --> 1970.16]  Is
[1970.16 --> 1970.64]  Basted
[1970.64 --> 1971.20]  Because
[1971.20 --> 1971.26]  He
[1971.26 --> 1971.32]  Is
[1971.32 --> 1971.46]  A
[1971.46 --> 1971.86]  Turkey
[1971.86 --> 1972.64]  I
[1972.64 --> 1973.12]  I
[1973.12 --> 1973.16]  I
[1973.16 --> 1973.18]  I
[1973.18 --> 1973.20]  I
[1973.20 --> 1973.22]  I'm
[1973.22 --> 1973.24]  I'm
[1973.24 --> 1973.48]  I'm
[1973.48 --> 1974.92]  I'm really surprised how negative people react to that
[1974.92 --> 1976.36]  Dude that is turkey behavior
[1976.36 --> 1976.70]  Why
[1976.70 --> 1978.18]  I
[1978.18 --> 1978.54]  I
[1978.54 --> 1983.56]  This is one of those things where if I have to explain it you're not capable of understanding it
[1983.56 --> 1984.66]  I don't get it though why
[1984.66 --> 1988.92]  Explain it explain it anyways try it oh my god try me okay the risk of loss
[1988.92 --> 1994.28]  is super high never lost any I didn't say that you will lose it I said the risk of loss
[1994.28 --> 1996.70]  I can't do it with these but with the ones that had the longer
[1996.70 --> 1999.82]  stem I could like lay down and do bench
[1999.82 --> 2003.04]  Presses with them stashed there and they would they would stay no matter what
[2003.04 --> 2005.74]  You're an you're an actual sociopath
[2005.74 --> 2012.30]  Like that's the only that's the only explanation I've never lost one that way and I've done it so much
[2012.30 --> 2013.68]  Kifrig
[2013.68 --> 2017.26]  Someone just tried it said wow it actually stays on quite well yeah it does
[2017.26 --> 2019.66]  Kifrig said that's not so bad
[2019.66 --> 2023.78]  Jade de Duval says that's actually insane
[2023.78 --> 2029.80]  So you know what at the very least I can say that's a polarizing choice
[2029.80 --> 2033.02]  Let's get back to let's get back to the air pods pro 3s
[2033.02 --> 2035.02]  It makes me sick
[2035.02 --> 2038.62]  Everyone's gonna unsubscribe
[2038.62 --> 2043.74]  Are there any internal transfers for positions available right now?
[2043.74 --> 2047.50]  You know I do this I've done this in the gym with you
[2047.50 --> 2058.22]  So okay in other news the air pods pro 3s are getting a new fifth size of ear tip a double xs
[2058.22 --> 2064.94]  Which is gonna be great for kids so these are like guys okay hold on oh my god we're coming back to this
[2064.94 --> 2069.66]  That's not how I like wear them that's how I stash them if I'm not currently using them
[2069.66 --> 2072.44]  I feel like you're if I need to take it out of my ear to listen to someone
[2072.44 --> 2076.14]  I feel like you're trapped in the me arguing with people about american cheese loop right now
[2076.14 --> 2081.44]  Because one person is gonna say something like that and then you're gonna respond to it
[2081.44 --> 2087.24]  And then everyone else is gonna hear only where I them and they're gonna run with it
[2087.24 --> 2091.40]  And then you're gonna be stuck in this loop where all you ever said was that
[2091.40 --> 2095.80]  Not american cheese regular cheese is perfectly meltable
[2095.80 --> 2099.62]  And people are gonna run in completely
[2099.62 --> 2100.42]  Now you're the cheese guy
[2100.42 --> 2102.00]  Completely different directions
[2102.00 --> 2102.84]  Right right right
[2102.84 --> 2104.62]  And think that you hate hot dogs
[2104.62 --> 2108.16]  So yeah let's just let's move on from this topic
[2108.16 --> 2112.50]  This will be great for kids because like on a plane or whatever
[2112.50 --> 2118.50]  When when that's the that's I try to think we never did in restaurants
[2118.50 --> 2120.96]  We've only occasionally done it in the car
[2120.96 --> 2123.84]  I think that's like the ipad parenting time for me
[2123.84 --> 2125.30]  Is on the plane
[2125.30 --> 2129.32]  We'll just give the kids the phone give them the ipad give them the headphones
[2129.32 --> 2132.14]  There's three of them right plane is acceptable
[2132.14 --> 2137.16]  So they sit in their own row we're not even there sure and we just have a flight by ourselves
[2137.16 --> 2139.26]  And our kids they just watch movies anyways
[2139.26 --> 2146.38]  So so yeah that's gonna be that's gonna be great because i've got i've got little girls and they have little ears and
[2146.38 --> 2148.22]  Smaller ear tips is gonna be awesome
[2148.22 --> 2151.28]  Not that i'm not that i'm gonna get my kids the new ones anyways
[2151.28 --> 2157.12]  They're gonna get my hand me downs so whatever but um they've got a new ultra low noise microphone apparently
[2157.12 --> 2159.52]  uh multi-port acoustic architecture
[2159.52 --> 2164.22]  So I does that mean they have multiple drivers i'm actually not sure i haven't looked into them that much yet
[2164.22 --> 2167.30]  I'm, not working on my video yet because we don't get early access to apple hardware
[2167.30 --> 2171.36]  Uh new h2 chip heart rates are actually is that i don't think that's new
[2171.36 --> 2173.40]  I think that's the same one heart rate sensing though
[2173.40 --> 2175.70]  So for people who work out this could be
[2175.70 --> 2180.68]  Useful, I guess if you don't want to wear a watch I guess there's some moves you wouldn't want to watch on for right for sure
[2180.68 --> 2181.86]  Um, I would
[2181.86 --> 2184.06]  I like this actually I think that's very cool
[2184.06 --> 2188.78]  This is one of the things that like I was like i'm sad about this i'm sad about this because I can't get the pros
[2188.78 --> 2191.92]  Mmm, right because he doesn't like silicone
[2191.92 --> 2197.44]  Yeah, they just squish themselves out of my ears because I have weird ear canals, but right um
[2197.44 --> 2200.96]  Yeah, it's that's actually really cool feature
[2200.96 --> 2204.24]  Not that I necessarily think you're gonna go around like
[2204.24 --> 2208.56]  um, some people were talking about how this is better because you can do it without your phone on you
[2208.56 --> 2212.08]  I think this is specifically I saw comments what then I was genuinely confused
[2212.08 --> 2215.36]  I think this is specifically a so that you don't have to have your watch on you
[2215.36 --> 2216.48]  um
[2216.48 --> 2221.90]  And I would prefer to wear like as few accessories as possible when i'm out doing stuff
[2221.90 --> 2222.70]  So
[2222.70 --> 2226.30]  It being able to be measured through your your earbuds is pretty neat
[2226.30 --> 2229.40]  um
[2229.40 --> 2238.14]  Most importantly they are ip57 now so they're like super sweat proof and water resistant and are the same price
[2238.14 --> 2246.90]  So apple seems to be kind of just sucking it up on their higher costs in order to capture some market share right now
[2246.90 --> 2254.56]  Which feels like an uncharacteristically aggressive apple like they're they're almost coming across a little
[2254.56 --> 2260.52]  Still in the most apple way possible, but they're coming across a little scrappy here, which
[2260.52 --> 2262.60]  I kind of like
[2262.60 --> 2264.82]  I I think it's pretty cool
[2264.82 --> 2272.34]  Do we uh, do we expect them to put a removable battery in them anytime soon? No, nope go yourself
[2272.66 --> 2274.66]  They're still apple, but the
[2275.22 --> 2278.58]  Airpods pro 3s those were an immediate order for me when I saw them
[2278.58 --> 2283.62]  I'm some people are saying that the new ear tips are are foam and silicone and that they have
[2284.58 --> 2285.38]  Uh
[2285.38 --> 2290.34]  Some new yeah thing maybe I don't know. Maybe I'll give it a shot, but probably not
[2290.34 --> 2291.02]  I can give it a shot
[2291.02 --> 2294.50]  I don't think it's gonna work for you if there's any kind of silicone slippage. Yep
[2294.82 --> 2300.10]  I agree. Oh, there's some new watches who cares? Um, let's move on to a new topic
[2300.10 --> 2301.54]  I mean
[2301.54 --> 2304.98]  Does anyone love the apple watch?
[2306.90 --> 2312.66]  Apple watch feels more like just a a complete it's like a mini the minivan of apple products
[2312.66 --> 2318.26]  It's like I got the apple watch because I have everything else. I need notifications when my hands are dirty
[2318.26 --> 2322.98]  Or like I I got it from my grandpa because he might slip and fall
[2323.94 --> 2324.74]  um
[2324.74 --> 2326.98]  It just it just feels like uh
[2326.98 --> 2331.54]  Okay, people in chat. They love their apple watch their the fitness stuff is that yeah
[2331.54 --> 2334.50]  Someone said fitness slash outdoors people the fitness stuff is actually wild
[2335.06 --> 2337.54]  I've just the apple watch is like the king of that
[2337.54 --> 2341.94]  I gave up completely when my apple watch series something or other
[2342.26 --> 2345.70]  Congratulated me for my excellent bike ride while I was driving down the highway
[2346.74 --> 2349.94]  I was just like well, this is just obviously you're biking really fast
[2349.94 --> 2356.02]  Yeah, biking really fast and my heart rate is a very relaxed resting heart rate like can we like I just
[2356.74 --> 2358.10]  I would rather
[2358.10 --> 2363.06]  Personally, I would rather have no data than have bad data that I can't trust
[2363.06 --> 2367.22]  It's I just don't care, but I can't care about it. You can't really trust any of them
[2367.22 --> 2372.90]  But it's heart rate stuff the last time I looked into it was a very long time ago was better than like everybody's and by a long shot
[2373.46 --> 2374.50]  um
[2374.50 --> 2376.50]  Which is interesting
[2377.30 --> 2378.18]  Okay
[2378.18 --> 2383.86]  Yeah, maybe it's worth giving another shot really wish we were able to make that that video way back in the day
[2383.86 --> 2385.38]  Do you remember that?
[2385.38 --> 2387.22]  That project I was trying to do with ubc
[2387.22 --> 2391.62]  I think we've talked about it on one show before where we they had like a lab where we could hook up all the
[2391.62 --> 2398.98]  Radiology lab all the real all the real probes and then like where all the fitness trackers and see which ones were the most accurate
[2399.38 --> 2404.74]  Uh, but then for whatever reason they weren't able to do it. So it didn't happen, but I'd love to revisit the concept
[2404.74 --> 2409.22]  I think others have done it since then though probably so I don't think it would be a novel thing. Yeah
[2411.06 --> 2413.06]  Um
[2413.46 --> 2418.10]  Okay, what are we supposed to be doing now you want to you want to pick a topic what it says topic two sure
[2418.10 --> 2423.46]  We can do this corsair one or we can jump down into
[2425.54 --> 2429.54]  Oh, the one might take a bit. Do we have the anthropic settlement in here?
[2430.26 --> 2435.06]  Oh, we didn't know we don't have that this week guys. Sorry, but that's interesting. Go look it up on your own. I guess
[2436.50 --> 2437.46]  the ai news is
[2438.98 --> 2441.54]  Fast heavy and always very similar
[2442.74 --> 2444.02]  I don't think it's good to
[2444.02 --> 2448.10]  I don't know if this one's I don't know if this one's that similar. I don't know what this one is
[2448.82 --> 2451.62]  No, this one's kind of a big deal. Okay, um, yeah
[2451.62 --> 2455.06]  Anthropic agree fine. We'll just we'll just go through it live
[2455.06 --> 2463.22]  uh, anthropic agreed to pay 1.5 billion dollars to settle claims that it downloaded pirated books to train its ai systems
[2464.26 --> 2466.26]  and this has um
[2466.90 --> 2472.10]  Who are they paying? Oh, wait, that was eight days ago and then three days ago from reuters a federal judge in san francisco
[2472.10 --> 2476.02]  Has declined for now to approve the settlement that was announced friday?
[2476.66 --> 2476.98]  so
[2478.18 --> 2479.22]  stuff's going down
[2479.86 --> 2480.66]  um
[2480.66 --> 2487.94]  And my understanding is that because they settled and it never went to trial this wouldn't be a precedent
[2488.50 --> 2491.38]  and so the matter is still unresolved of like
[2492.42 --> 2497.54]  copying copyrighted works to train your ai's and if you should you know
[2497.54 --> 2501.54]  Probably have your company just shut down because it was built on
[2502.10 --> 2504.10]  Other people's copyrighted works or
[2504.66 --> 2508.98]  Maybe what you're doing is so transformative and terribly important that
[2509.46 --> 2511.86]  Maybe we just should not care about copyright in this case
[2512.58 --> 2516.18]  Those are kind of the two the two camps on either end and it is
[2516.82 --> 2519.86]  Unresolved which will be the law of the land
[2520.42 --> 2522.74]  uh for the time being so yeah, because I can
[2522.74 --> 2527.30]  I can I can understand the argument of like national security stuff
[2528.82 --> 2530.90]  I don't know if like it's
[2531.62 --> 2535.30]  important for national security that it reads like werewolf smut
[2538.02 --> 2538.50]  I don't know
[2539.38 --> 2544.18]  Hold on one sec float plane chat y'all need to calm down or i'm gonna start issuing timeouts to all of y'all
[2544.18 --> 2544.98]  Oh, what's going on?
[2544.98 --> 2547.46]  Thank don't worry about it. All right. Um, okay
[2547.46 --> 2553.30]  Uh, should we maybe do the corsair loss class action loss?
[2553.30 --> 2554.58]  Yeah, because I
[2555.70 --> 2561.38]  I am pretty peeved about this. There's a canadian one for bread by the way
[2561.38 --> 2565.30]  Uh, okay, but that that one i'm not upset about so
[2566.66 --> 2569.46]  oh, man, this is dude. I am like
[2570.74 --> 2572.34]  Oh, I hate this. Okay, so here
[2572.34 --> 2578.74]  Corsair gaming had to pay five and a half million dollars to settle a claim
[2578.74 --> 2581.54]  Shut up to settle a claim of
[2581.94 --> 2588.26]  Effectively false advertising on their ddr4 and ddr5 memory products
[2589.38 --> 2592.50]  Plaintiffs and there's a bit of editorialization here
[2592.50 --> 2593.54]  um
[2593.54 --> 2595.94]  And blood-sucking lawyer leeches
[2596.66 --> 2602.02]  Claimed that consumers reasonably believe that corsair memory will run at the advertised speeds
[2602.34 --> 2606.90]  But in reality the memory does not and cannot run at these advertised speeds out of the box
[2607.62 --> 2615.46]  Trying to get corsair memory to run at the advertised speed requires altering your computer's firmware to attempt to make the memory run at higher than standard speeds
[2615.46 --> 2619.06]  This is known as overclocking and overclocking often does not work
[2619.30 --> 2622.90]  There is some substantial risk that attempts to overclock will fail
[2623.86 --> 2630.58]  All of which is technically true, but in this case, I don't actually think it's the best kind of true
[2630.58 --> 2633.06]  Also from the complaint
[2634.02 --> 2640.34]  Plaintiff and class members were injured as a direct and proximate result of corsairs contact conduct because
[2640.90 --> 2647.14]  A they would not have purchased corsair high-speed memory if they had known that corsair would breach its warranty and
[2647.14 --> 2647.54]  B
[2647.54 --> 2653.70]  They overpaid for high-speed memory products because they are sold at a price premium due to corsairs false warranty
[2653.70 --> 2657.78]  And in this case warranty doesn't mean that they fix it if it's broken
[2657.78 --> 2662.02]  They mean they warrant that it will operate the way that it says on the box
[2663.94 --> 2670.18]  The complaint states numerous times that consumers expect those speeds out of the box
[2670.18 --> 2676.26]  But this appears to me even though this is a settlement and therefore not
[2677.70 --> 2680.02]  Like an established precedent
[2682.10 --> 2688.10]  This seems to me to open up an entire can of worms and make it pretty
[2688.74 --> 2690.74]  difficult to advertise
[2690.74 --> 2692.74]  a lot of things that
[2693.22 --> 2696.50]  require some technical know-how in order to
[2696.50 --> 2700.66]  Get the sort of the advertised result
[2701.70 --> 2702.74]  Like am I
[2703.78 --> 2707.06]  Am I missing something here? Like do you guys think i'm off base here?
[2707.70 --> 2710.58]  Because basically every memory manufacturer
[2711.22 --> 2713.22]  Is now at risk of
[2713.86 --> 2721.78]  Either not being able to advertise what the sort of the overclocked capability because the ram itself is capable of the speeds
[2721.78 --> 2726.90]  That much is that much is certain and I you know from my point of view
[2726.90 --> 2731.78]  They label xmp or docp or expo profiles or whatever else
[2732.50 --> 2733.86]  Pretty clearly
[2734.42 --> 2739.30]  I also think that it's really weird to go after like corsair for this very specifically
[2739.94 --> 2742.10]  Everybody if you're buying corsair though
[2743.06 --> 2744.66]  You know, I I would I would
[2745.30 --> 2746.90]  think at the very least you
[2746.90 --> 2754.34]  You read an article once I mean maybe maybe this is one of those things where I often i'm often lecturing the audience about
[2754.66 --> 2761.38]  Don't assume sort of the knowledge of even people who who participate in this in this hobby, but like good lord
[2761.78 --> 2764.82]  Avon fox said in industrial applications
[2765.38 --> 2772.34]  Sorry in industrial automation things are sold with actual and theoretical capability ratings. That's kind of neat
[2772.34 --> 2776.90]  Or or or showing like a default
[2778.26 --> 2779.30]  And a potential
[2780.42 --> 2781.30]  Yeah, I mean
[2781.30 --> 2786.98]  But I don't I I I kind of agree with you that I don't think this should have been targeted at corsair specifically but like okay
[2787.22 --> 2790.90]  So if asus has a 165 hertz
[2791.46 --> 2797.30]  Okay, no, let's go. Let's go bleeding edge if if if asus has a 480 hertz monitor. Yeah
[2797.94 --> 2798.90]  How
[2798.90 --> 2803.62]  How much do they have to disclaim tricky? Yeah, how much do they have to disclaim that you're gonna need a
[2804.26 --> 2806.66]  GPU and a cable that will actually
[2807.22 --> 2809.14]  Be able to run it that like you
[2809.86 --> 2813.78]  You're putting together a computer piecemeal red bull doesn't actually give you wings thing
[2813.78 --> 2816.74]  I think there's a bit of an expectation that if you are buying a
[2817.38 --> 2822.10]  constituent component of something that you are doing so with
[2822.82 --> 2828.42]  Some expectation that you will acquire the knowledge to install and operate it. I
[2829.54 --> 2831.14]  I'm, sorry, man. I don't like this
[2831.70 --> 2832.02]  I
[2832.74 --> 2837.06]  At this level with the explanation that I have heard so far. I don't like it either
[2837.62 --> 2838.10]  um
[2840.58 --> 2844.74]  I wouldn't mind if there was maybe some minor changes to packaging like it's a bit of a meme
[2845.30 --> 2848.26]  Like going to your friend's house and freaking out that his monitor still is 60 hertz
[2848.98 --> 2850.26]  Is like a thing
[2851.06 --> 2857.94]  Uh, so if there was like a little bit better explanation of of this type of stuff finding people's ram is at default speeds
[2858.74 --> 2861.06]  Is very common as well. This is true
[2861.54 --> 2865.94]  Um, like if there was a little bit more explicit communication that could be cool
[2865.94 --> 2870.10]  But I don't I don't necessarily know that it was worth this and I don't think it makes any sense to target just corsair
[2870.10 --> 2878.66]  Other manufacturers apparently do use terminology like up to to describe the frequencies that their memory kits will run at
[2879.22 --> 2879.62]  um
[2879.62 --> 2885.54]  But I mean this seems to be corsair has also denied any wrongdoing here
[2885.54 --> 2888.26]  And this seems to be a yet another case where the defendant settles
[2888.58 --> 2894.26]  Knowing that the settlement will be less than the cost of litigating it or the potential negative publicity if they are found
[2894.90 --> 2895.94]  Guilty
[2895.94 --> 2898.26]  I think this is
[2898.90 --> 2902.10]  Lame still and I think that while I mean
[2902.98 --> 2911.22]  You know, frankly, I don't have a ton of sympathy for publicly traded corporations that probably have plenty of money or whatever
[2912.10 --> 2914.50]  In general corsairs kind of been bros
[2915.54 --> 2918.18]  You know, I think they've overall
[2919.22 --> 2923.22]  Stood behind their products and been pretty chill that their products can be
[2923.22 --> 2925.30]  Expensive sometimes
[2926.10 --> 2928.26]  But I I don't think that corsair has been
[2928.90 --> 2932.82]  Particularly evil so if there was someone that was going to kind of get picked on
[2933.46 --> 2939.38]  I would I would much rather it been it'd be someone that's been you know kind of a you know a bastard
[2940.10 --> 2944.26]  At some point or another and I just don't think that corsair has has has
[2945.30 --> 2949.54]  Has earned you know a five and a half million dollar hit to their pocketbook for
[2949.54 --> 2951.54]  Frankly
[2951.54 --> 2955.86]  Something that people could have looked up on wikipedia before they went and installed
[2956.34 --> 2958.74]  um a component product and something
[2959.86 --> 2960.58]  I don't like it
[2963.38 --> 2964.10]  Dan what's next
[2966.10 --> 2972.34]  I'm not sure because like i've got an extra sponsors thing that i'm supposed to throw somewhere and I don't know where to put it
[2972.34 --> 2974.42]  Well, they didn't wait this wasn't planned out
[2975.06 --> 2975.46]  I don't know
[2976.10 --> 2980.10]  I thought it was planned out dude. It's wan show. I haven't figured it out yet. It's a good point
[2980.10 --> 2984.18]  It's the redheaded stepchild of linus media group media properties like it's
[2984.74 --> 2985.86]  I've been doing
[2985.86 --> 2989.54]  I wasn't even sure if you're gonna make it tonight
[2991.22 --> 2993.86]  That's yeah, how close were you dude
[2994.58 --> 2999.54]  Like did you just walk on the set before I got here like five ten minutes? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh wow
[2999.54 --> 3005.62]  Also, there was the street could have been broken. I should maybe tell this story right now. You could have been on a plane
[3005.78 --> 3007.78]  No, you're gonna tell it after we do
[3008.26 --> 3010.26]  Sponsors, I guess

[3041.38 --> 3046.50]  Is that a bunny cow? Oh, I thought it was an ai thing. I didn't look that closely at it. I was like good lord

[3121.78 --> 3122.18]  I don't well
[3122.18 --> 3125.70]  I don't think we should do the cw announcements right after we did a sponsor spot
[3125.94 --> 3127.54]  Well, that's we really need to get
[3128.26 --> 3130.02]  Luke has to talk about his his thing

[3132.50 --> 3137.70]  You should put a sign that says Luke talk about his thing. I don't have any more card paper. Okay
[3139.14 --> 3141.14]  We don't have the budget for that
[3142.82 --> 3144.82]  You guys make me sound like such a cheap c**k
[3146.82 --> 3148.74]  Honestly though, I'm glad he said it
[3152.18 --> 3154.02]  I mean no you're not we love you
[3156.02 --> 3158.02]  You're so reasonable
[3158.02 --> 3163.62]  When was the last time I turned down a purchase request name it?
[3163.62 --> 3167.22]  I don't think maybe I was lying to cover my laziness
[3168.18 --> 3174.42]  I literally buy fire trucks for the memes. Oh hold on. Never mind. I take it all back. I have a giant stack right here
[3178.98 --> 3180.98]  Sorry, we lost the budget to have a producer
[3180.98 --> 3182.98]  I am right now
[3182.98 --> 3184.98]  Okay, do I talk about the trip sure
[3186.50 --> 3191.54]  Did you fall yeah? No actually never and I climbed a mountain so nice
[3192.42 --> 3195.22]  Nice yeah, no I was I was in Sofia
[3196.26 --> 3199.38]  Bulgaria, right? Oh, that's the kind of mountain you were climbing
[3201.30 --> 3202.42]  Oh
[3202.42 --> 3204.50]  Nah, he wasn't he's loyal. Yeah
[3205.46 --> 3210.02]  Oh, or not. You know what whatever happens whatever happens with full consent from all parties. I don't judge
[3210.98 --> 3212.34]  That would still be it's a ding
[3212.34 --> 3212.42]  It's a ding
[3212.98 --> 3213.22]  Sure
[3214.02 --> 3217.06]  But yeah loyal and faithful I guess are not quite the same thing correct
[3223.06 --> 3225.86]  Would it still be faithful if it was like uh
[3226.50 --> 3227.22]  Yes, okay
[3227.22 --> 3232.42]  No, I think faithful has a has a connotation of religious of no no no no no
[3232.42 --> 3235.46]  I think I think well faithful has a connotation of 2-1
[3236.82 --> 3238.26]  from my from my point of view
[3238.26 --> 3243.54]  I was thinking faithful to wishes and understandings. Yeah, exactly
[3243.78 --> 3248.02]  Not in loyal it's just like that is like it's like 15 other people
[3248.66 --> 3252.10]  I completely regardless and no none of that happened anyways
[3252.82 --> 3255.14]  I wouldn't judge. I wouldn't judge. That's all
[3256.34 --> 3260.42]  I was there. Yeah local time. So luke was in Sofia
[3260.42 --> 3264.26]  Yes, yes local time for them
[3264.98 --> 3270.90]  I left at I think it was 5 p.m. 5 p.m. Okay, so this is in belgium hungary. Where was it again?
[3270.90 --> 3277.22]  Bulgaria Bulgaria, right and it I had a I had a pretty tight connection, but it would be fine
[3277.70 --> 3283.46]  Yeah, theoretically as long as nothing got delayed. I would be landing back in munich
[3283.46 --> 3287.94]  Yeah, and then taking a train overnight up to berlin and then flying back to
[3288.58 --> 3291.30]  Vancouver through a connection vancouver. I hardly know her
[3295.86 --> 3296.98]  Um
[3296.98 --> 3299.46]  It was not whiz air it was lafthansa
[3299.94 --> 3301.78]  um yeah anyways
[3302.98 --> 3308.02]  To fly because of course it needed to be a fairly tight connection to the train the flight got delayed
[3308.02 --> 3313.94]  Because of course it because of course it did it was only delayed by 25 minutes. I still could make it
[3314.18 --> 3321.78]  Yeah, it was gonna be close. Yeah, and it was those can be the worst ones sometimes though because then they don't proactively reschedule you
[3322.34 --> 3327.94]  Oh, no, the plane and the and the train were booked separately. So they didn't care at all nice
[3328.82 --> 3332.10]  Because of course I'd even ask because there's no way they're gonna care
[3332.42 --> 3333.62]  um
[3333.78 --> 3337.14]  So my whole thing like as we're landing is like okay
[3338.02 --> 3343.62]  It's close. We can definitely make it. I know exactly the train station is extremely easy to navigate
[3343.86 --> 3346.90]  So once I get to the train station from the airport, no problem
[3347.30 --> 3352.26]  Not an issue. I can have like two minutes and I can run all the way to the train and get on the train
[3352.26 --> 3353.30]  It's no problem
[3353.30 --> 3355.78]  um, but I needed I had check luggage
[3356.66 --> 3358.66]  So I need the check luggage to come off like
[3359.14 --> 3361.14]  pretty quick. Oh, no, no
[3361.30 --> 3364.66]  Why is that always last when you're in a hurry? Guess how long?
[3364.66 --> 3365.86]  20 minutes
[3365.86 --> 3368.26]  Guess how long it took just just from when we landed
[3368.74 --> 3373.06]  to the to my bag which by the way was in the first three bags to come off
[3373.30 --> 3376.18]  Guess how long it took for my bag to come out from when the plane landed
[3376.90 --> 3378.90]  You realize the only solution is gamer jet
[3380.58 --> 3387.94]  55 minutes what it's the longest I've literally ever had to wait when there wasn't some type of like accident
[3387.94 --> 3396.18]  Um, I there was there was genuinely like hundreds of people waiting in the baggage area for two carousels
[3396.18 --> 3401.14]  I have no idea what was happening. I don't know if they were like short staffed that day or something, but it took
[3402.10 --> 3406.34]  Forever it was crazy. So I definitely missed my train
[3406.42 --> 3410.26]  I had like pre-booked the heck out of my ticket because you save a ton of money that way
[3410.26 --> 3418.26]  Yeah, and I had a direct likes saving money. It's great. I had it all perfectly. Yeah, it's actually I think what gets them off
[3418.90 --> 3420.10]  A little bit. Yeah, a little bit
[3420.74 --> 3425.62]  So I had a direct direct train too. So I knew I could get a decent sleep. Yeah on the train
[3426.02 --> 3429.38]  um, oh, no, so not only did I have to get a
[3430.02 --> 3432.02]  Indirect train so I had to get a transfer
[3432.58 --> 3436.82]  But also I had to book now last minute. So I had to pay expensive
[3437.62 --> 3439.62]  train prices
[3440.58 --> 3448.18]  Um, so I I couldn't like sleep properly. So anyways, so far we are one uber one flight in
[3448.82 --> 3454.26]  End up figuring out that I can't take my nice one train now. I have to take two trains to berlin. So
[3454.98 --> 3460.42]  Uh, I get to the train station. I'm like, okay, this train is leaving in in like, you know
[3462.34 --> 3467.46]  In 45 minutes, it's gonna take me half an hour to get to the train station. I can make this new train now
[3467.46 --> 3472.50]  It'll be fine. I get there. Okay, the trains delayed by like 15 minutes. That's fine though
[3472.98 --> 3476.66]  Okay, the trains delayed by like half an hour. That's fine now get on the train
[3476.98 --> 3481.78]  Oh, while the train is rolling for some reason it gains another half an hour of delay
[3481.78 --> 3484.58]  So it gets to the next train station an hour late
[3484.82 --> 3487.78]  I'm all worried because I'm like, I'm gonna miss the next train
[3487.78 --> 3489.54]  I had an hour to get
[3489.54 --> 3494.66]  I had an hour at the next train station to transfer and now I have like four minutes or something
[3494.66 --> 3498.50]  And i'm like, oh my god, if it's in a weird spot, i'm gonna miss my next train
[3498.90 --> 3502.66]  Nope, not a problem because the next train got delayed by an hour
[3503.78 --> 3509.94]  What is happening? What is up with german german transportation? I heard this as like a meme before I went there
[3511.38 --> 3516.34]  Everything's just delayed all the time as far as I can tell while I was standing in the train station getting off
[3516.34 --> 3519.54]  My train that was delayed for an hour waiting for another train that was delayed for an hour
[3519.54 --> 3523.78]  I heard other trains announcing that they were delayed like
[3524.42 --> 3528.98]  Crazy oddly enough the trains were extremely comfortable very nice, right?
[3528.98 --> 3530.98]  Just never there on time, right?
[3531.78 --> 3533.94]  Anyway, so that train gets delayed for an hour
[3533.94 --> 3536.98]  So then i'm waiting for it anyways despite thinking that I was gonna miss it
[3538.02 --> 3543.86]  Get into boleyn take another train to get me from the like main train station in berlin to the airport
[3543.86 --> 3548.10]  Yeah, and then that flight takes me to frankfurt and then that flight takes me to vancouver
[3548.10 --> 3551.38]  So it was and then I get picked up from the airport by emma and brought here
[3551.62 --> 3555.78]  So it was it was three cars three trains three planes
[3556.42 --> 3558.50]  and like 30 plus hours
[3559.30 --> 3561.70]  And uh, I got to wancho on time
[3562.42 --> 3564.90]  By 10 minutes by 10 minutes nice
[3565.62 --> 3571.14]  Did I ever did I ever tell you about uh how I almost got stuck in la when we went down there to collab with kyle?
[3572.26 --> 3573.14]  I don't think so
[3573.14 --> 3575.54]  Canada like didn't have enough air traffic controllers
[3575.54 --> 3579.06]  Whoa, so a bunch of flights into ivr were delayed
[3579.06 --> 3581.30]  Whoa, my flight was cancelled
[3581.94 --> 3586.90]  And then I was I like immediately went to the air canada desk
[3587.46 --> 3588.50]  Where they told me?
[3589.06 --> 3592.82]  There's nothing we can do you can have a flight tomorrow
[3593.14 --> 3598.18]  Which I said was not good enough because my daughters were having seven teeth out the next morning between the two of them
[3598.74 --> 3600.90]  And they were super stressed. I promised i'd be there
[3600.90 --> 3602.90]  Um
[3602.90 --> 3606.58]  So they said okay. Well, I don't know whatever you can call the phone lines because they can do more than we can
[3606.82 --> 3610.50]  So I call the phone line. They tell me yeah, i've got a flight for you. I go
[3611.38 --> 3613.46]  Oh my god. Thank god. Okay, uh
[3614.02 --> 3620.34]  Vance so the executive assistant here, uh, don't bother booking me that west jet flight that you found
[3620.90 --> 3625.54]  Um air canada has a flight for me then she goes. Oh, yeah. Can you depart from this airport?
[3625.54 --> 3632.10]  I'm, like bro. I just told you i'm at lax that is literally three hours from here in la traffic right now
[3632.10 --> 3636.66]  And it's 45 minutes until the flight. How could you possibly think that I could make it?
[3636.66 --> 3642.98]  Okay, vance book it vance goes. Oh, yeah, by the way, it went up like four hundred dollars because everyone is rebooking
[3643.22 --> 3646.10]  Uh, it's like going up by the minute. I'm like, oh my god
[3646.66 --> 3652.50]  Book it and so he books it. I spend twelve hundred dollars on a plane ticket from la to vancouver
[3652.50 --> 3656.10]  And then the air canada rep goes actually i've got one for you
[3658.58 --> 3663.38]  And instead of being a connecting one through like edmonton or something it's a direct flight
[3663.38 --> 3666.74]  But it's like later in the day then that flight gets delayed
[3667.14 --> 3672.42]  So i'm sitting here at the airport the one that glenn or one of our shooters got booked for
[3672.98 --> 3673.54]  um
[3673.70 --> 3678.74]  Was canceled again in the in the like mid-afternoon and then my evening one left an hour late
[3678.74 --> 3684.90]  But ultimately I like did get here. I surprised yvonne by being an intruder in our house and coming into the bedroom
[3684.90 --> 3689.30]  I told her I wasn't going to make it home that night. So you just showed up and I showed up. Oh my god
[3690.18 --> 3694.10]  Yeah, I just my flights to germany for this trip. Yeah, um
[3694.66 --> 3701.38]  I was talking to sammy about it because I got my two tickets. Yeah, and my my second one so once we landed in
[3701.38 --> 3703.38]  uh
[3704.58 --> 3710.58]  Man, I don't even remember where our first landing was but once we landed there. I I didn't have a seat on the second plane
[3711.06 --> 3716.42]  Oh my god. Oh, right. I almost didn't get on to the flight. So because
[3717.14 --> 3722.34]  She she sent me my booking confirmation by email. So I thought I had a ticket
[3722.82 --> 3726.26]  So when I got to the counter, I didn't tell the best part of the story when I got to the counter
[3726.26 --> 3731.22]  They like I didn't have a seat. Yeah, because I never checked in yeah
[3731.22 --> 3736.02]  Because I was already there at the airport and I just I thought that my booking confirmation was a ticket
[3736.02 --> 3740.82]  I didn't understand the difference. I'd never done that before and so I I like showed them my booking confirmation
[3740.82 --> 3744.66]  It had a barcode on it. I don't know that I would have thought differently. They let me through security
[3744.66 --> 3745.62]  Yeah, yeah
[3745.62 --> 3747.54]  Even though I didn't have a ticket
[3747.54 --> 3753.62]  So there was one more middle seat and they and they were able to to put me in the first lady at the at the counter get to get on
[3753.62 --> 3759.86]  The plane i'd been at the airport for like nine and a half hours or ten hours by this point the first one was like
[3760.42 --> 3762.66]  Well, you don't have a ticket and I was like, what do you mean?
[3762.66 --> 3765.86]  I don't have a ticket. I'm standing here at the gate aren't I how did I get here? Yeah
[3766.26 --> 3771.06]  Um, but then I realized oh, they never actually scanned my ticket. They scanned my passport
[3771.86 --> 3773.70]  And they looked at what I had
[3774.42 --> 3778.18]  But they never actually scanned my ticket. So I was never checked in
[3778.98 --> 3783.54]  Um, that's wild and then the second one was like move and like checked
[3783.54 --> 3786.90]  For me and was like, okay, no, I got one. Here's your ticket
[3787.38 --> 3792.50]  And I was like, thank you. This actually means the world pretty great. I do I actually kind of hate traveling
[3793.22 --> 3799.30]  Yeah, like that was so stressful. I like traveling. I actually really do I don't like
[3800.66 --> 3802.66]  um
[3803.94 --> 3807.78]  I really really hated rebooking those train tickets
[3808.50 --> 3809.54]  That pissed me off
[3809.54 --> 3811.06]  Oh, I hate that
[3811.06 --> 3812.90]  Needing to like pay last minute prices
[3812.90 --> 3814.34]  West jet wouldn't refund it
[3815.22 --> 3820.66]  Yeah, I they have a they have a zero exceptions within 24 hours. I think it is no refunds
[3820.66 --> 3822.98]  Even if you just booked it five minutes ago. They're like no
[3823.54 --> 3829.22]  Yeah, I was like bro. If you unbook it now you could literally just sell it to someone else who also desperately needs to get home
[3829.22 --> 3831.22]  They'll do that anyways
[3831.22 --> 3833.62]  They'll just overbook their plane
[3834.34 --> 3838.18]  Um, yeah, the the the thing that saved me getting to berlin
[3838.82 --> 3843.30]  $1200 was that I checked in so early and for some reason they just didn't assign me a seat
[3843.30 --> 3845.22]  But I had checked in really early
[3845.22 --> 3849.30]  So that when it came down to like the seat lottery thing, I just automatically won
[3850.18 --> 3852.26]  Because I had checked in first by like a lot
[3852.26 --> 3856.18]  Did I ever tell you how I almost missed my play when I went to uh, edinburgh?
[3856.90 --> 3861.38]  No, I I man I like when I went to see joseph yeah, yeah
[3861.78 --> 3863.06]  Oh, yeah, we almost missed our plane
[3863.38 --> 3868.74]  We flew into heathrow and then our plan was to have a connecting flight to edinburgh, but our connecting flight was canceled
[3869.30 --> 3872.82]  And the new flight they assigned us was going to be there too late to see the play
[3873.62 --> 3878.90]  I was only there to see joseph in the amazing technicolor dreamcoat with donny osmond as the pharaoh
[3879.38 --> 3882.50]  And if I wasn't going to see that play then why was I even there?
[3882.50 --> 3888.90]  So we so we are standing there in the airport like can you rebook us and like no no, we got nothing like uh
[3889.46 --> 3892.66]  Okay, um, okay. So what are our other options? We we
[3893.86 --> 3895.94]  We looked into chartering a private plane
[3896.98 --> 3898.42]  because like
[3898.42 --> 3901.22]  I literally was already flew across the world
[3901.22 --> 3904.98]  It's only in europe it's still and I didn't even actually know this at the time
[3904.98 --> 3907.94]  But it was the last performance so it was like I thought you did know that
[3907.94 --> 3911.62]  I didn't know that before we sat down and they said this is the last performance
[3911.78 --> 3916.10]  So I wouldn't even I could have even like not known thinking I could go a day later anyway, we actually
[3916.90 --> 3921.94]  So turns out charging is really expensive in case you were wondering. It's yeah, very expensive
[3922.26 --> 3928.02]  I remember from that one scrapyard wars so we found so we found a we found a train
[3928.02 --> 3931.14]  Oh, yeah, okay, and um
[3933.30 --> 3937.62]  We were like, okay, we can do the train which is only like a couple hundred dollars um compared to
[3938.18 --> 3943.46]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars for charter for the plane, which what was what was incredible though was dude
[3943.46 --> 3947.94]  I gotta say like the the the airplane charter business damn
[3947.94 --> 3951.86]  Do they ever have like customer service figured out I emailed I was like damn it?
[3951.86 --> 3956.42]  They only have an email. They don't have a phone line. I emailed they emailed me back in like three minutes
[3957.38 --> 3962.50]  And they were like here's our phone number. Let's talk and they were like, yeah, we can have you we can have you taken off
[3962.50 --> 3965.62]  Within like the next 90 minutes or something like that. I was like
[3966.26 --> 3970.74]  You just like found one that's nearby and yeah, we got you. I was like wow, that's crazy anyway
[3971.22 --> 3973.38]  Um, so yeah the plane so the train
[3973.38 --> 3979.06]  Uh ended up running like two hours and five minutes late, which it turns out means you get your fare for free
[3979.86 --> 3984.74]  So my story worked out. So maybe that's why I ultimately didn't tell the story some that makes sense
[3984.74 --> 3986.90]  Somebody in full plane chat pointed out in germany
[3986.90 --> 3991.38]  If your train is 20 minutes late your ticket becomes a flex ticket so you take any train of your choosing
[3991.78 --> 3994.50]  That is cool. The problem for me was the
[3995.06 --> 3998.50]  Nice pre-booked train that I had was the one that wasn't late
[3999.14 --> 4004.02]  The plane was late. So I didn't make that train right and then I had to book other trains
[4004.58 --> 4006.82]  And those ones were late, but I had to take them
[4007.30 --> 4010.82]  Anyways, it didn't matter if I took them later if I didn't take those specific trains
[4010.82 --> 4013.06]  I would not make it to berlin on time to take my flight out
[4014.10 --> 4016.42]  A couple people also said why didn't you just drive?
[4016.98 --> 4021.94]  Um, I did look into that. Yeah, dimitri actually suggested that I just drive really
[4023.14 --> 4030.74]  But I went and looked at renting a car. Yeah, and the rental car place had a 1.1 or 1.2 star rating
[4031.30 --> 4035.86]  And like all of the reviews were about how they tried to scam them for damage and like
[4035.86 --> 4041.94]  um, oh, i've been fighting a double charge for a car rental for a year was somebody's comment
[4042.42 --> 4045.46]  And I was just like, I'm gonna take the train
[4046.26 --> 4051.86]  Yeah, dimitri's reviews of bulgaria in general. No, no, no. This was germany. Oh, this was germany. Yeah
[4052.50 --> 4056.82]  Oh, okay. Yeah, because I know he had trouble getting review samples sent to him there and stuff. Oh
[4057.38 --> 4058.50]  stuff would just get like
[4059.06 --> 4063.86]  Disappeared, you know, uh stuff would happen. I'm not gonna say specifically because I don't remember the details
[4063.86 --> 4069.14]  But he was just like yeah, sometimes it could be a real challenge to get review samples sent there. Yeah, I actually had
[4070.50 --> 4072.50]  uh
[4072.50 --> 4075.62]  I didn't take a lot of public transport in bulgaria
[4076.34 --> 4079.78]  But like the bulgarian airport was completely fine in my experience
[4080.42 --> 4083.22]  no direct planes from bulgaria well my
[4084.66 --> 4089.86]  Flights I travel in a really whack way where I do a lot of my travel planning like once i'm already there
[4089.86 --> 4093.94]  So my flights to canada and back were out of berlin
[4095.70 --> 4096.66]  And then the
[4097.30 --> 4100.74]  Easiest way for me to get to bulgaria at the time was through munich not berlin
[4101.38 --> 4106.34]  So when i'm saying i'm flying back to germany and then taking a train up to berlin i'm flying back to munich
[4107.30 --> 4107.54]  um
[4108.82 --> 4111.14]  Yeah, so it was actually like pretty far from berlin
[4112.10 --> 4118.74]  So there there i mean there probably was maybe not direct planes but easier ones but my my flight was already through berlin
[4118.74 --> 4125.22]  And if I don't make that one that was the one that the company had booked for me
[4125.22 --> 4130.58]  So if I don't make that one, I just have to pay for my own entire ticket myself because it would have been entirely my fault
[4130.82 --> 4134.66]  So like i'd rather not do that. So i'm gonna try to make that one
[4134.82 --> 4138.74]  I wish I journaled more of my crazy travel stories because they're always like
[4139.14 --> 4143.70]  I took a bunch of photos of like I have some really funny ones. Oh, where's my phone?
[4143.70 --> 4147.46]  Like the time that I was literally by like 10 seconds
[4148.02 --> 4150.74]  uh on time for my plane back from japan
[4151.46 --> 4157.70]  Like like they looked at the supervisor because it was literally like the minute of the of the cutoff and he's like
[4158.98 --> 4167.14]  Gives a nod but like it was bad. It was because I was like 42 cents short of the fare for my for my train into the airport
[4167.14 --> 4173.06]  Uh, and the lady like wouldn't let me go and I was like, oh my god, I don't care. I don't have any cash
[4173.06 --> 4175.38]  I just I need to make my plane, but it's japan
[4178.82 --> 4180.42]  There ain't a lot of flexibility on that
[4181.78 --> 4186.18]  So I like this photo because it's like it's supposed to show it was my fault entirely
[4186.26 --> 4190.34]  It was only because I accidentally left all of my luggage on my previous train
[4190.82 --> 4195.22]  And I had to go to the lost and found I had to catch a later train and I like picked the wrong one
[4195.22 --> 4199.70]  I like picked the one that left earlier rather than the express one anyway. Ah, I've done that before
[4200.34 --> 4207.54]  Um, oh, yeah, so it's like hits it's supposed to show up at like 13 past midnight. Oh, it's gonna show up at 105
[4207.94 --> 4214.10]  It is 108. Oh my god. How does that work? Yeah, that's good math. That's german math. Yeah, um
[4214.66 --> 4220.10]  I noticed a couple times that it's like the delayed time will be a time that we've already passed also
[4220.58 --> 4222.58]  We were rolling
[4223.22 --> 4227.70]  Slow because we're like near the train station the guy said over the intercom
[4228.18 --> 4232.50]  We'll get there at 111 which is later than either of those times if you noticed
[4232.98 --> 4234.18]  um, and then
[4235.22 --> 4243.06]  1 11 comes and goes and we're still rolling and it like blew my mind that we're within like slow rolling distance of a train station
[4243.54 --> 4250.66]  And they still can't get the time right like we ended up getting there like I think two or three minutes later than the guy on the intercom said
[4251.30 --> 4253.30]  despite being within like
[4254.26 --> 4259.06]  Jogging distance of the station. So here's my question. I don't understand my question. Okay
[4262.50 --> 4266.26]  These guys are world renowned for watches
[4267.78 --> 4271.46]  Is this like a tariff issue? Is there some kind of border control?
[4271.46 --> 4273.86]  I don't know what it is because like
[4274.42 --> 4276.10]  I'm just I'm just asking questions
[4277.14 --> 4281.14]  I'm just asking questions the trains in germany were the most comfortable trains i've been on in my life
[4281.94 --> 4283.94]  especially the
[4283.94 --> 4288.50]  The last one that I took it had like leather seats like super nice
[4288.74 --> 4292.66]  Okay, and I was in like the cheap cheapest super saver fair
[4292.98 --> 4297.30]  area and they had leather like very nice leather seats nice and
[4298.02 --> 4300.02]  We're super late. I
[4300.74 --> 4302.26]  Don't get it
[4302.26 --> 4304.26]  German trains are banned by this way
[4304.26 --> 4307.22]  So
[4307.22 --> 4308.50]  So it's not part of the eu oh
[4310.34 --> 4313.14]  All right, that's interesting. Uh, okay, dan. What are we supposed to be doing?

[4500.98 --> 4507.30]  I just well well they shouldn't say the purple they should go to this poll and then they should vote on it
[4507.86 --> 4509.22]  It's on youtube
[4509.22 --> 4515.46]  So dan if you want to drop them some links there people seem confused by the instructions this is not voting
[4516.98 --> 4519.62]  Right here what you're looking at right now is not voting
[4520.42 --> 4522.18]  This this place this is voting
[4522.18 --> 4524.18]  The floatplane people don't even know what that website is
[4524.18 --> 4526.82]  I'm doing it you're spamming too much and can't see it
[4526.82 --> 4530.34]  They don't know what that website is because it doesn't work properly in firefox
[4532.58 --> 4534.26]  So what use would they have for it?
[4534.98 --> 4536.02]  You're just sending it
[4539.14 --> 4539.94]  Oh my goodness
[4539.94 --> 4541.22]  My links they do nothing
[4541.22 --> 4545.38]  It really is amazing that they can even find their credit cards to pay for floatplane isn't it
[4545.86 --> 4548.18]  I love you guys but their mom takes care of it
[4548.18 --> 4550.42]  You can't you can't follow instructions sometimes
[4551.14 --> 4551.46]  Yeah

[4558.42 --> 4563.86]  Wow an unrelated cylindrical object okay cool let's uh let's maybe do another
[4563.86 --> 4567.94]  Here wait let me let me do a bit of an update so I got linked to this
[4571.22 --> 4576.98]  By multiple people in the floatplane chat uh crappy pcb and
[4578.18 --> 4579.54]  uh dark guy 2
[4580.66 --> 4585.94]  Both linked to this uh which is hilarious someone else in floatplane chat said that apparently something
[4585.94 --> 4591.86]  It it has to do with something about the the like german car lobby messing with public transport or something
[4591.86 --> 4595.62]  What who knows I don't know I don't know but I just thought this is funny
[4595.94 --> 4597.54]  I also wanted to talk about
[4598.82 --> 4604.90]  Um actually wait no I think I'm supposed to talk about that later i'll save i'll save that topic for for another time
[4604.90 --> 4607.94]  Okay, I I think I got
[4610.18 --> 4613.06]  I think there's a pizza conspiracy going on
[4614.42 --> 4617.22]  But we can talk about it later a different pizza conspiracy
[4617.22 --> 4620.02]  Yeah, I was gonna say because what what talking different one
[4620.74 --> 4624.18]  Disrespect very different no no no no no okay
[4624.18 --> 4626.90]  So not that one yeah, a much more serious one
[4627.54 --> 4630.50]  Okay, i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding a lot less serious
[4630.50 --> 4631.46]  Oh my god
[4632.58 --> 4633.70]  You're stressing me out luke
[4634.58 --> 4636.58]  You're stressing me out you're making me stressed
[4637.22 --> 4641.94]  But I think yeah, I think i'm supposed to like talk about it later something for some reason. Yes, I am. Okay, cool
[4642.18 --> 4645.78]  Anyways, I think I am supposed to talk about how to send a merch message
[4645.78 --> 4651.06]  If you guys want to interact with the show the best way to do it is to send a merch message these go to producer dan
[4651.38 --> 4658.82]  Who will put them down there or respond to them or curate them for me and luke to respond to all you need to do
[4658.98 --> 4661.94]  To send a merch message is add something anything to your cart
[4662.50 --> 4663.78]  Go ahead and
[4663.78 --> 4668.42]  Fill out a merch message probably do it a little bit better than this you can pick a color would be fine though
[4668.42 --> 4673.78]  I can do that. You can do that. It won't get curated for sure, but whatever it'll show up on screen. Yeah, it will
[4673.78 --> 4675.78]  Um, so that's something
[4676.10 --> 4680.98]  And then you go ahead and check out and once you have paid for your order your merch message will go to
[4681.54 --> 4685.86]  Producer dan who will then do something along the lines of what he's about to do, which is maybe to
[4686.42 --> 4691.86]  Uh read it for us. That's right. That's what I do. Very good. Hey dll question
[4692.50 --> 4699.46]  For linus sometimes is there going to be a new winter jacket this year. Oh, uh, hold on. I might have it in my car
[4699.94 --> 4701.94]  What so really do another one for luke? Oh
[4701.94 --> 4703.94]  Luke
[4703.94 --> 4704.26]  Uh
[4704.26 --> 4705.38]  Luke
[4705.38 --> 4708.10]  Luke, uh
[4708.10 --> 4710.10]  I can do a topic if you need
[4710.10 --> 4712.42]  Frigge
[4712.42 --> 4713.78]  Frigge
[4713.78 --> 4715.94]  Frigge
[4715.94 --> 4723.86]  Ah, okay. This might work for you as well. Sure. Uh, we can ask linus about the second half when he returns
[4723.86 --> 4732.02]  How do you feel about so many people having parasocial relationships with you and your subordinates? I know you more than you will ever know me
[4732.50 --> 4735.14]  Also, have you ever owned a pet rat or a mischief?
[4736.66 --> 4737.70]  Or a mischief?
[4737.70 --> 4739.70]  Mischief
[4740.34 --> 4740.98]  Mischief
[4740.98 --> 4741.70]  Copy
[4741.70 --> 4742.42]  Paste
[4742.42 --> 4743.70]  Animal
[4743.70 --> 4744.50]  What is that?
[4747.38 --> 4749.14]  Is that just like any rodent?
[4749.70 --> 4751.38]  I don't know a mouse
[4752.10 --> 4752.98]  Hamster
[4752.98 --> 4753.46]  Hamster
[4753.46 --> 4754.66]  Is that like a genus?
[4754.66 --> 4760.02]  No, I've never had any of those. I've had dogs and birds. I have not had a oh and fish
[4760.50 --> 4762.58]  I haven't had a super wide range of
[4763.54 --> 4765.54]  animals
[4765.54 --> 4769.46]  A group of rats is called a mischief
[4769.46 --> 4769.94]  Wow
[4769.94 --> 4771.46]  Ha ha learning
[4771.46 --> 4772.18]  Not a king
[4772.18 --> 4773.46]  Thank you, wikipedia
[4773.46 --> 4773.86]  Um
[4773.86 --> 4774.18]  Oh, that's
[4774.18 --> 4774.74]  That's
[4774.74 --> 4775.14]  That's
[4775.14 --> 4775.30]  That's
[4775.30 --> 4775.78]  That's
[4775.78 --> 4775.86]  That's
[4775.86 --> 4776.74]  That's
[4776.74 --> 4777.30]  Jesus
[4777.30 --> 4777.86]  Jesus
[4777.86 --> 4779.06]  Christ
[4781.22 --> 4782.66]  Did you bleep those?
[4782.66 --> 4784.10]  Yeah, I did
[4785.38 --> 4785.62]  Okay
[4786.26 --> 4787.94]  It doesn't bleep on my end
[4788.82 --> 4789.78]  You can see the button
[4789.78 --> 4791.46]  Man, what was the question even again?
[4791.94 --> 4794.10]  Have you ever owned a mischief?
[4794.10 --> 4795.86]  No, but wasn't there one before that?
[4796.42 --> 4797.38]  You are drunk
[4797.38 --> 4798.42]  Uh, linus
[4798.42 --> 4798.82]  Yeah, a little bit
[4798.82 --> 4802.50]  How do you feel about so many people having parasocial relationships with you?
[4802.50 --> 4802.90]  Yeah
[4802.90 --> 4804.34]  And your subordinates
[4804.34 --> 4806.74]  I know you more than you will ever know me
[4806.74 --> 4808.26]  Also, have you ever owned a pet rat?
[4808.26 --> 4812.50]  Or as we now know a group of pet rats is called a mischief
[4812.50 --> 4813.70]  Oh, it's this
[4813.70 --> 4816.10]  I think it's weird that people think this is a new problem
[4817.06 --> 4818.02]  That's my hot take
[4818.74 --> 4821.14]  Oh, the parasocial relationships or the pet rats?
[4821.14 --> 4822.50]  People only really talk about it now
[4822.50 --> 4825.70]  But like people were hyper obsessed with like
[4825.70 --> 4827.14]  Princess Diana, the Beatles
[4827.14 --> 4827.78]  Oh yeah
[4827.78 --> 4828.34]  Oh yeah
[4828.34 --> 4831.14]  Like, like way hyper obsessed
[4831.14 --> 4831.46]  I think
[4831.46 --> 4833.14]  I would argue more than people are now
[4833.14 --> 4835.22]  I think the difference now
[4835.78 --> 4840.58]  Is that the people that we have these parasocial relationships with
[4840.58 --> 4845.38]  seem so much more accessible and like real people
[4845.38 --> 4847.14]  than the old celebrities were
[4847.14 --> 4847.78]  Well, they can't
[4847.78 --> 4851.38]  they actually can't afford the amount of separation that the old celebrities had
[4851.38 --> 4851.94]  Well, yeah
[4851.94 --> 4856.90]  Like I the realistically I'm not that I'm not that hard to talk to
[4857.54 --> 4857.94]  Like yeah
[4857.94 --> 4861.94]  It's not that hard to like get my email address
[4861.94 --> 4866.90]  I won't respond to you because you know, I just get too many emails
[4866.90 --> 4870.18]  Especially every time I acknowledge how easy it is to find my email address
[4870.18 --> 4871.94]  So there's no point
[4871.94 --> 4877.78]  And if you do email me, especially at those times, I will certainly filter so that I block probably not only you
[4877.78 --> 4881.46]  But the entire domain that you're emailing from if you work at a business or something like that
[4881.46 --> 4884.42]  Because I just like I can't have people bothering me and wasting my time
[4884.90 --> 4891.78]  Um, but in terms of like how how accessible sort of internet celebrities are
[4892.82 --> 4894.02]  They're they're super accessible
[4894.02 --> 4897.38]  And not only that but they're they're accessible like emotionally
[4897.38 --> 4903.06]  Because they have something in common with you other than that they make music you like to listen to
[4903.46 --> 4907.86]  Or they sit on a throne that you know has oppressed your people for hundreds of years
[4907.86 --> 4909.22]  I've you know that sort of thing
[4909.22 --> 4911.54]  I've had someone come up to me and like apologize for
[4912.26 --> 4913.78]  having a parasocial relationship
[4914.50 --> 4915.14]  and then like
[4916.02 --> 4921.70]  Jokingly mentioning some things that happened on when as a reference for them having a parasocial relationship and i'm like man
[4921.70 --> 4924.90]  Like I we make the content so that you watch it like
[4924.90 --> 4929.46]  I'm watching when show is not being weird and parasocial yeah
[4929.46 --> 4933.78]  There's a difference between like knowing some stuff that happens on when show or like, you know
[4934.98 --> 4939.54]  Sometimes they reference like oh, yeah, but I know things that happened in your life like yeah, because I talked about them on when show
[4940.10 --> 4942.58]  Like that's okay. This is fine
[4943.06 --> 4950.34]  Like there's a difference between like watching the show that and walking up to me at the airport and sitting down next to me
[4950.74 --> 4952.74]  and just like
[4952.74 --> 4956.98]  I'm delighted when i'm clearly in the middle of something like talking to me without
[4957.54 --> 4964.26]  Going away eventually to be clear as if your friends walk up and grab a selfie for sure totally fine
[4964.82 --> 4967.78]  totally fine happy to do that and
[4968.66 --> 4970.82]  But like that's the that's the key
[4972.10 --> 4975.70]  Don't assume that we're friends. Yeah, and that i'm like
[4975.70 --> 4980.66]  Like i'm with my family or whatever else and even if i'm with my family, you know what grab a selfie
[4980.66 --> 4983.06]  So my new my new policy. I have a new policy for that
[4983.38 --> 4987.30]  Like I have a new system for that that actually makes it like pretty not disruptive
[4987.78 --> 4992.98]  So i'll be like i'll be like walking in a mall and i'm like with my family or i was gonna say friends
[4993.14 --> 4998.26]  No, i'm with my family. I don't have friends, uh, but you're a friend. Um, but we don't walk around in the mall together
[4998.58 --> 5001.86]  No, so i'm walking in the mall. I'm with my family and
[5003.14 --> 5005.70]  Um, someone's like can I get a selfie i'll be like sure
[5005.70 --> 5007.06]  Keep up
[5007.06 --> 5012.66]  Yo, i've done that i've done that for sure dude. It's great. It's actually fantastic because they get their selfie
[5013.38 --> 5015.78]  I am not separated from my family
[5016.42 --> 5023.22]  And hot take everyone's happy the selfies often end up looking pretty cool, too. Yeah, I don't know why just like on the roll
[5023.22 --> 5025.86]  It's like pretty neat. Um
[5026.58 --> 5031.70]  Just want to say I had fun chatting to you briefly at defcon. I always feel yeah, I mean that was probably totally fine
[5031.70 --> 5033.46]  So that's a different context too though
[5033.46 --> 5037.94]  Like if you walk up and you want to chat with me a little bit at like a whale land or ltx
[5037.94 --> 5041.94]  I was there purely on vacation. Oh, okay. That's different then, but it was still totally fine
[5041.94 --> 5045.78]  I mean, it's still you're at a you're at a con for sure. I think you're kind of walking it. You're yeah
[5045.78 --> 5052.02]  And I didn't mind at all. Okay, sure to be honest. Okay, cool. Yeah, um, but yeah, no and so so context
[5052.74 --> 5053.62]  Is
[5053.62 --> 5058.10]  Everything but anyway, so back to the question the the parasocial relationships. Um
[5058.10 --> 5066.26]  I I think the these the the the fact that the relationship forms over something we have in common
[5066.82 --> 5068.82]  makes it in some ways
[5069.78 --> 5073.62]  Stronger and feel more but also not
[5074.34 --> 5078.82]  Like like strong like bizarre like uh john hinckley or whatever
[5079.30 --> 5083.70]  Like, you know shooting reagan over you know, what's her name in taxi driver, but like
[5083.70 --> 5091.38]  Like but like almost like less strong like more natural because it just kind of happens over time from from extended exposure
[5091.38 --> 5093.38]  and like having common interests like I
[5096.02 --> 5100.02]  I don't I don't know man. I um, I don't think i'll ever be used to it
[5101.30 --> 5103.86]  Is is the bottom line oddly enough?
[5103.86 --> 5106.26]  I think I kind of am it doesn't really bother me anymore
[5106.26 --> 5110.02]  Well, I didn't say bother. It never really bothered me. It definitely bothered me
[5110.82 --> 5116.02]  For a lot. Well, even just it can be socially really useful sometimes getting recognized in public
[5116.66 --> 5120.90]  Like like made me deeply uncomfortable at the beginning now i'm used to that
[5122.18 --> 5122.90]  But I wouldn't say
[5123.70 --> 5126.98]  But I think i'm not used to the one-to-many
[5127.86 --> 5131.46]  Relationship and I don't think I can ever get used to I don't think we're wired for it sure
[5132.02 --> 5136.82]  I I uh, I've two funny interactions that had at pax this year one
[5137.46 --> 5142.42]  Somebody took a selfie with me and then like 10 minutes later walked by and was like oh by the way
[5142.42 --> 5146.90]  Can you come back like right here in like two and a half hours to take a photo with my friend?
[5147.78 --> 5148.90]  And I was like no
[5149.78 --> 5152.02]  And I think that was one of the only times i've ever like
[5152.66 --> 5155.70]  Let the annoyance like really go into my response
[5156.18 --> 5159.86]  So I was like walking with my brother and like one of my high school friends
[5159.86 --> 5163.86]  And he like asked me to come back. I was just like no like
[5164.74 --> 5167.54]  What do you ask like not a chance like
[5169.46 --> 5171.94]  Sorry if you're watching but like no dude
[5172.50 --> 5175.70]  No, no way someone pull something really similar with me once
[5176.18 --> 5181.70]  Like like can I if I come back like can I go get someone and come back and will you still be here and I was like
[5182.42 --> 5182.66]  No
[5182.66 --> 5189.22]  Yeah, I think I was at ltx and like I I was like at a particular spot
[5189.22 --> 5192.42]  I was like no, i'm gonna be i'm gonna be all over the place like I
[5192.90 --> 5194.18]  There's literally
[5194.18 --> 5195.30]  Thousands of people here
[5195.30 --> 5196.98]  Not necessarily as bad
[5196.98 --> 5201.62]  Well, it was it was it was they didn't know where their friend was
[5201.62 --> 5205.46]  Oh, well, yeah, okay. That doesn't help. They didn't know how long I was gonna be standing there
[5205.78 --> 5207.78]  Are you gonna be around for like five ten more minutes?
[5207.78 --> 5212.02]  No, it was like I will be back at some indeterminate amount of time stay here
[5212.02 --> 5213.94]  Yeah, that sucks. Bro, I can't do that
[5213.94 --> 5214.66]  There's no way
[5214.90 --> 5219.46]  The other one though is where i'm saying that like i've actually find they're actually pretty often like helpful
[5220.18 --> 5223.70]  Is very funny interaction there was a there was a youtuber that I
[5224.18 --> 5228.98]  Have enjoyed watching a fair amount at pax who had a little booth and they were filming
[5229.54 --> 5231.14]  These five-minute podcast things
[5232.10 --> 5237.38]  Um, which I didn't really know what any that was about but it said ask me about five-minute podcasts
[5238.50 --> 5240.58]  Um, so I just walked up to the booth thing
[5241.46 --> 5245.14]  Uh, and was like hey, love your stuff shook his hand and was like, that's it
[5245.14 --> 5246.42]  I just wanted to say I like your stuff
[5246.42 --> 5250.50]  Then and then I was like before I leave what's this five-minute podcast thing?
[5251.06 --> 5253.14]  He's like, okay, let's film one and I was like
[5254.02 --> 5255.14]  Uh, all right, sure
[5255.70 --> 5260.26]  So we just I like just stood in front of the camera and filmed this like thing with them and he's like, all right cool. Bye
[5260.26 --> 5261.70]  And then as i'm leaving
[5262.18 --> 5268.58]  Two different people like said hi and wanted selfies and I was like that was the best timing ever because now he's like who the hell is this guy?
[5269.70 --> 5271.22]  That's pretty cool. That's great
[5272.10 --> 5277.78]  And I hope it comes out at some point because i'd like to see it but i've had times when i'm at a meeting with a potential sponsor
[5277.78 --> 5282.26]  At a trade show and someone will come up to my table and ask to take a selfie and they're like huge
[5283.30 --> 5287.06]  Huge it's amazing timing can be so good especially in the early days
[5287.62 --> 5293.38]  It was amazing how one person walking up during the meeting meant so much more than
[5294.42 --> 5296.50]  300 000 subscribers
[5296.50 --> 5303.14]  Yep, which is it's it's it's how palpable it is. Yeah, it was uh, it was fantastic when dating
[5307.30 --> 5311.86]  It was wild when dating every time I went out I was like please
[5314.50 --> 5316.50]  And then it would happen and it was so good
[5316.50 --> 5325.46]  You could at least pretend not to enjoy it that much it was great. Yeah, okay fair enough. It's great
[5325.46 --> 5327.86]  You got to play it off as if you're not like oh, thank god
[5329.46 --> 5331.46]  It is what it is
[5331.46 --> 5339.54]  All right, so fame and chicken yeah, dude that should be the name of your memoir
[5346.90 --> 5348.74]  Yeah, did you ever have anyone think it was fake?
[5349.62 --> 5352.66]  Like you paid someone to do that? No, I don't think so. Well, okay
[5353.22 --> 5356.98]  None that said anything. Oh, okay. I mean maybe but yeah, okay, I don't think so
[5356.98 --> 5363.38]  Okay, so i'm ready to i'm ready to acknowledge the outerwear that I am wearing right now
[5363.38 --> 5365.62]  Yeah, because it's starting to yes activate
[5365.86 --> 5372.58]  So what's cool about this particular jacket is that it uses a thermochromic material
[5373.14 --> 5374.98]  It's not like the warmest layer ever
[5375.70 --> 5379.94]  It's kind of like a lightly puffy jacket that's meant to be kind of layered on
[5379.94 --> 5382.90]  Um, but it is an it is an outer layer
[5383.22 --> 5387.38]  Um, so it's kind of like a like a fall like a late fall early spring
[5387.78 --> 5390.98]  Uh, or like a layered up winter depending on your climate
[5391.54 --> 5399.06]  But what's cool about it is that if for whatever reason you find yourself indoors or somewhere warmer or there's a spot
[5399.46 --> 5407.06]  Um, oh wait. Yeah, let's go this way or there's a spot on the jacket where it kind of folds in on itself. It's color changing so cool. So
[5407.06 --> 5412.58]  It ends up with this kind of kind of like flame like
[5413.70 --> 5420.58]  Like kind of fiery sort of look to it that uh, as soon as I saw the material I was like
[5421.70 --> 5427.14]  Okay, I don't know. I think it's really cool and and obviously it invites, you know
[5427.14 --> 5433.38]  I was gonna say playing with it because your skin temperature is enough to activate my hands are really cold
[5433.62 --> 5436.90]  Oh, yeah warm hands. Yeah, all right hit me right there right there
[5437.06 --> 5442.26]  Buddy, how long does it take is that good? Oh, yeah, it should be fine. Yeah, there it is
[5443.22 --> 5445.22]  He's always such a warm boy
[5449.70 --> 5457.22]  I was gonna say yeah decent tactical choice to to like if you if you have a girlfriend and you want them to be
[5458.66 --> 5460.74]  Give excuses to hug you all oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[5460.74 --> 5465.94]  Yeah, you'd get the arm wrap around the back. Yep. Oh, yeah a hundred percent. Yeah, so it's
[5466.42 --> 5473.94]  It's one of those things that some people really like and some people will not but I saw the material and I was like, okay
[5474.82 --> 5476.02]  I
[5476.02 --> 5481.46]  I I I need us to do something with this. So we did a jacket. I think it's pretty cool. Yeah, very cool
[5481.46 --> 5485.14]  Um, all right
[5485.78 --> 5487.62]  How expensive is it? I don't know
[5488.82 --> 5490.98]  All right. Well cool answer that question
[5491.86 --> 5493.86]  All right, what are we supposed to be doing?
[5494.42 --> 5498.66]  Ah, yes, the real self-driving was the friends we made along the way
[5498.66 --> 5506.34]  Um sources electric dot co tesla has changed the definition of full self-driving you see
[5507.38 --> 5508.58]  FSD um
[5509.78 --> 5518.58]  Is not fully unsupervised autonomous driving go to sleep in the driver's seat wake up at your destination like we said it would be
[5518.98 --> 5520.02]  um
[5520.02 --> 5524.42]  When we charged as much as fifteen thousand dollars for it
[5524.42 --> 5528.26]  Um now it has a new definition
[5528.74 --> 5529.46]  uh
[5529.46 --> 5531.46]  FSD now means
[5531.46 --> 5533.46]  An advanced driving system
[5533.78 --> 5544.74]  Regardless of the marketing name used that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions
[5545.78 --> 5547.22]  the author
[5547.22 --> 5554.26]  Opines that the current version of fsd which requires constant supervision by the driver could easily fit that description
[5555.30 --> 5556.42]  Uh
[5556.42 --> 5558.74]  Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh oh
[5559.38 --> 5565.46]  The automaker has updated their language on their website now selling only full self-driving supervised
[5565.86 --> 5570.10]  And not the previous full self-driving capability fsd
[5570.50 --> 5573.94]  So we actually have an image here from this is from electric
[5574.66 --> 5576.66]  full self-driving supervised
[5580.90 --> 5582.90]  I don't like that
[5583.70 --> 5593.78]  Beginning in 2016 the company had claimed had claimed past tense now because they have clearly changed their messaging had claimed that all its vehicles in production
[5593.86 --> 5597.06]  would be capable of unsupervised self-driving
[5598.02 --> 5604.82]  Since 2018 ceo elon musk has claimed that this year is the year only to reach the end of each year with the promise
[5605.38 --> 5606.58]  unfulfilled
[5606.58 --> 5614.90]  tesla previously confirmed that vehicles produced between 2016 and 2023 do not have the proper hardware to deliver the promised unsupervised self-driving
[5615.62 --> 5616.26]  um
[5616.26 --> 5619.54]  their ceo has discussed upgrading the computers in these vehicles
[5619.54 --> 5623.94]  but there doesn't appear to be even a concept of a plan for implementing this
[5624.58 --> 5625.86]  upgrade very cool
[5625.86 --> 5635.78]  I remember having an infuriating conversation with uh finance bro at a at a party once
[5636.66 --> 5637.70]  i know this story
[5638.50 --> 5638.74]  that
[5638.74 --> 5641.46]  Basically boiled down to
[5642.18 --> 5646.90]  I cover tech for a living and tesla has a serious problem with their tech
[5647.86 --> 5648.26]  and
[5648.26 --> 5650.50]  uh, the counter argument was
[5651.30 --> 5656.18]  lots of super smart people have invested so there's no way they won't deliver on this
[5656.18 --> 5664.26]  Yeah, and I I tried to I said well, do you want to see the tweet where elon admitted that like the cars they've been selling for all these years?
[5664.50 --> 5665.22]  Can't do it
[5666.26 --> 5667.14]  didn't want to see it
[5667.78 --> 5668.34]  and
[5668.34 --> 5675.78]  I was told that I just didn't understand finance and that the like the the details of the tech didn't matter and I was like
[5676.50 --> 5678.02]  right, but
[5678.02 --> 5679.70]  people
[5679.70 --> 5684.50]  Invest in this company because of the the the the the tech right like that's
[5685.06 --> 5686.26]  What theoretically people I
[5686.90 --> 5690.02]  As far as I can tell tesla is gone stock for meme stock
[5690.98 --> 5692.82]  wall almost all stock market guys
[5693.38 --> 5697.70]  I wouldn't say almost all i'd say like there's a lot of high profile examples these days
[5697.70 --> 5702.98]  But not almost all but a lot of the high profile examples is where a lot of the money in the stock market is sitting currently
[5703.54 --> 5705.54]  Yeah
[5706.74 --> 5707.54]  Um
[5707.54 --> 5712.02]  Not ginger nutted in float plane chat says here's ginger nutted. Yeah, I like
[5712.58 --> 5714.82]  I thought it was worth reading out a lot out loud
[5716.02 --> 5718.02]  um
[5721.14 --> 5726.74]  Oh, no, that's not actually the tweet that I was referring to there was one where he far more explicitly admitted that um
[5727.70 --> 5733.54]  Fsd whatever the hardware level was that was up until a couple of years ago three, I think I was just
[5734.50 --> 5741.38]  Never gonna be capable of it. Um, and it was already clear like way before that that it wouldn't be capable because they were already using
[5741.94 --> 5747.46]  Both of what were supposed to be the redundant computers in order to achieve full level four or level five
[5748.02 --> 5748.98]  You have to have redundancy
[5748.98 --> 5751.54]  But they like didn't because they were using the whole thing already
[5751.54 --> 5755.30]  So people had known for ages that it was just never going to be able to do it
[5755.30 --> 5757.30]  It just took them a really long time to admit it
[5757.70 --> 5763.86]  Um, I just I I don't know man people I I often get accused of being an elon hater
[5764.34 --> 5767.94]  um, but what it really boils down to is I don't respect people who
[5768.58 --> 5774.42]  Lie to me constantly over and over and over again and just expect me to keep believing them
[5774.42 --> 5780.82]  Um, um, because I feel that that shows disrespect to me and therefore I cannot respect that
[5781.22 --> 5785.38]  If you make a good faith effort to follow through on the things that you tell me
[5785.38 --> 5792.74]  Um, or if you have the self-awareness to apologize and make good then that makes a big difference
[5792.74 --> 5793.38]  but if you just
[5794.10 --> 5798.98]  Lie over and over and over and over and over and over again, um
[5798.98 --> 5802.98]  Um, then I just I don't I don't respect that I can't respect that
[5803.78 --> 5804.10]  so
[5804.98 --> 5811.22]  There you go. It's it's kind of it's kind of that simple. I remember having a uh a conversation with a
[5811.86 --> 5813.06]  family member
[5813.06 --> 5816.82]  About a particular politician and I basically just went well
[5817.70 --> 5824.02]  You know, here's an example of a bald-faced lie. Um, you know, why did they say that it's demonstrably false?
[5824.34 --> 5826.34]  And he went I don't know and I went well, yeah
[5826.34 --> 5828.90]  I can tell you why it's because he doesn't respect you
[5829.54 --> 5833.54]  um, he doesn't think you are smart enough or detail oriented enough or
[5834.34 --> 5834.82]  um
[5835.70 --> 5839.14]  Conscientious enough to care and um
[5840.42 --> 5846.34]  And that's not respectful and that was uh, that was kind of a turning point which was a very which was a major
[5846.98 --> 5848.58]  Major relief and to be clear
[5849.22 --> 5854.18]  I intentionally kept that vague. I think that could apply to pretty much any politician
[5854.18 --> 5858.02]  Um, there's just degrees of um
[5858.82 --> 5861.30]  of brazen untruthfulness
[5862.90 --> 5867.70]  Uh extremely off topic, but I want to bring it up before I forget I saw jaden in chat and this reminded me
[5868.02 --> 5870.82]  Uh, he sent me a message after last wanshow
[5871.46 --> 5876.18]  Uh, where he said regarding wanshow discussion it is possible to assign different icons to notifications
[5876.90 --> 5881.22]  android only and whatsapp already shows profile image and notifications
[5881.22 --> 5885.78]  You you mentioned having I think it was different
[5886.50 --> 5890.66]  Yeah, icons for channels so we could do it. We could do it android only apparently
[5891.06 --> 5896.58]  I don't know. I don't know. No, don't bother then. I think it'd be better to just have feature parody and wait for apple to catch up
[5896.58 --> 5901.22]  I mean they eventually sure sure or maybe they just won't I don't know I
[5901.78 --> 5905.54]  I hadn't noticed it before he mentioned I think he oh wow
[5905.54 --> 5908.58]  I already forgot I just put it down. I am pretty tired from all the traveling
[5909.30 --> 5913.14]  Um, yeah, whatsapp already shows profile image. So uh, so whatsapp already does it
[5913.14 --> 5914.98]  But I don't use whatsapp very much
[5914.98 --> 5921.70]  So I didn't see it there and not a lot of other apps that I use seem to use this feature and I suspect it's because of
[5922.42 --> 5926.10]  uh, just having identical apps on both platforms, but I don't know
[5926.42 --> 5927.78]  um
[5927.78 --> 5929.30]  So, yeah, apparently that is a thing
[5929.30 --> 5931.62]  I just I think I don't remember exactly how I worded it
[5931.62 --> 5934.18]  But I think I said that I didn't think it was so apparently it is
[5934.18 --> 5940.58]  What is the consequence gonna be for this full self-driving false advertising?
[5942.50 --> 5942.82]  Is
[5943.46 --> 5950.74]  Are the regulators going to be empowered and are they going to have the stones to to follow through is
[5951.06 --> 5955.22]  Is it going to come down to individual owners to class action this like
[5955.62 --> 5959.70]  How is this going to play out because I think you could make the argument
[5959.70 --> 5965.54]  That a substantial portion like if if corsair had to pay five and a half million dollars
[5966.18 --> 5970.82]  Because some people didn't have xmp on by default in their gaming computer
[5971.78 --> 5976.82]  Right, like we're talking a hundred three hundred dollar purchase right of some ddr4 memory
[5978.18 --> 5980.34]  Yeah, how much will tesla oh
[5980.34 --> 5985.78]  When people figure out that the decade of cars they sold
[5986.58 --> 5992.74]  Are not and will never be capable of fully autonomous driving as they were advertised to be
[5993.38 --> 5998.58]  Meanwhile, uh, and this is going to be tough to see amongst all the ads, but there is a headline in the middle there
[5998.58 --> 6005.94]  Do you hear about this? Yeah, so I think this is a really I honestly I actually
[6008.02 --> 6010.42]  Okay, i'm gonna have kind of a controversial take on this one
[6011.14 --> 6013.14]  I think that this is
[6014.34 --> 6016.74]  See i've i have in the past
[6017.94 --> 6024.18]  Attributed to 4d chess what actually turned out to be phenomenal stupidity right so
[6024.18 --> 6027.14]  I hate making the same mistake more than once
[6027.94 --> 6032.26]  However, this one smells like a bit of 4d chess to me
[6033.38 --> 6035.62]  Because the conditions for that pay package
[6036.34 --> 6041.78]  Are that the company will have to reach a valuation that simply isn't going to happen
[6042.34 --> 6049.30]  Optimus is already dead in the water and everybody knows it it says specifically that they have to ship like an incredible amount of optimus
[6049.38 --> 6054.02]  Yeah, they have they ship like three hundred thousand optimuses a month or something
[6054.98 --> 6057.54]  What were the numbers get me get me the optimus numbers here?
[6058.50 --> 6062.58]  So the optimus is there is their robot that like is already
[6063.22 --> 6070.42]  Just a piece of dog compared to like unit tree models for a few grand and that they think they're going to sell for 200 to 300
[6070.42 --> 6073.38]  Thousand dollars each like to who what are you even talking about?
[6073.38 --> 6075.54]  I don't even think that article said i'm looking for another one
[6076.10 --> 6082.02]  Optimus is dead in the water with what logic with the logic of the head of the program who just left and was like
[6082.02 --> 6084.02]  Peace
[6084.02 --> 6087.46]  um optimus is dead in the water because they are so
[6088.10 --> 6094.10]  Far behind they can't figure out hands they can't figure out the ai side they can't figure out mobility
[6094.10 --> 6097.38]  so many of the demos that you've seen have just been remote telepresence
[6097.94 --> 6103.62]  Effectively of like a human just operating it remotely guys optimus is smoke and mirrors
[6103.62 --> 6105.62]  So yeah, uh
[6107.30 --> 6109.30]  Here we go. Here we go. Uh
[6110.10 --> 6112.58]  1 million robot deliveries
[6113.46 --> 6113.78]  uh
[6115.30 --> 6119.70]  In uh, 1 million robo taxis and opera. Yeah, like this stuff's not this stuff's not happening
[6120.42 --> 6120.82]  um
[6122.26 --> 6123.38]  So
[6123.38 --> 6126.58]  Yeah, so basically this one smells to me
[6126.58 --> 6134.10]  Like it's just supposed to grab headlines with a giant big number and it's supposed to help pump the stock because
[6134.90 --> 6135.22]  oh
[6135.22 --> 6139.54]  well, if they're gonna if if this pay package exists then there there's there's this path to this
[6140.26 --> 6140.50]  but
[6141.94 --> 6142.90]  I mean
[6142.90 --> 6145.62]  Obviously none of that is happening. There's no way that you know
[6145.62 --> 6147.78]  There's no way you could be on enough substances
[6147.78 --> 6152.90]  To think that you're gonna sell that many of a product that literally you would have to have a lot of substance
[6152.90 --> 6159.14]  You'd have to have a thousand percent tariff on it to make optimus at the price that they have sort of floated
[6159.46 --> 6164.58]  You'd have to have a 1000 tariff on it to make it competitive with something that unit tree is shipping like right now
[6165.54 --> 6166.42]  There's I
[6167.38 --> 6171.62]  I do know that a counter argument is that this is what was said about his first pay package
[6172.50 --> 6173.38]  Sure
[6173.38 --> 6176.42]  um, but I do think that was when the company was
[6177.54 --> 6181.46]  Poised for immense growth and had a lot of positivity surrounding it show
[6181.46 --> 6184.90]  Show me the immense growth that were poised for I mean in the us
[6185.54 --> 6188.90]  Sales are tanking in europe in the us the incentives are going away
[6189.54 --> 6191.78]  There was a robot at ifa
[6192.26 --> 6198.02]  um at a booth where it was a humanoid robot except it had two like
[6198.66 --> 6200.66]  uh airplane cables
[6200.74 --> 6204.74]  Hanging it from the ceiling because it couldn't stand on its own and it was like
[6205.70 --> 6210.02]  leaning over hanging off these cables and it was sorting laundry but like
[6210.74 --> 6215.54]  One out of three times that it tried to grab a piece of clothing. It would just like fail
[6216.58 --> 6220.18]  And all it was doing was like sorting colors and whites for washing
[6220.74 --> 6226.90]  Uh, and it was so incredibly slow and then it got like three quarters of the way through and I it just
[6226.90 --> 6232.58]  Could not grab them anymore because I guess it was too far down and it couldn't like bend because it was held by these cables
[6233.14 --> 6236.90]  So they had to re-pour the clothes back into the middle one so that it could keep going
[6237.14 --> 6239.14]  It was so brutal the watch
[6239.94 --> 6241.86]  It was so rough. Who was this?
[6242.34 --> 6246.74]  I don't remember the brand. It's in the uh, the float plane walkthrough with sammy and I
[6247.14 --> 6247.70]  um
[6247.70 --> 6251.86]  breakdown says i'd pay good money for a real laundry folding machine you better believe it me too
[6252.10 --> 6254.50]  Oh, it wasn't even folding. It was just sorting. Oh, wow
[6254.50 --> 6256.98]  It was just picking it up out of one basket and putting into another
[6256.98 --> 6261.14]  So actually useless then it was really bad. Yeah nice
[6262.50 --> 6264.50]  Oh
[6265.38 --> 6267.38]  Uh
[6269.06 --> 6274.50]  I feel like this is something completely different. Uh, this is a cooking robot at ifa 25 that
[6275.14 --> 6277.86]  appears to be doing basically nothing useful
[6278.98 --> 6281.70]  Yeah, no, it wasn't a cooking one very cool
[6281.70 --> 6285.38]  Um, it's in the float. We could like kind of show that bit maybe
[6286.50 --> 6287.22]  um
[6287.22 --> 6290.42]  Um, bring it up. So circuit king 98 says llms
[6291.14 --> 6295.78]  Not llm specifically, but I think you mean ai will unlock the humanoid robot market
[6295.86 --> 6301.22]  It's so early people said the same thing about full self-driving eight years ago. Okay, so there's a couple things we got to kind of
[6301.54 --> 6302.50]  um
[6302.50 --> 6304.50]  Talk about here the full self-driving
[6305.70 --> 6309.30]  Yeah, that's still not done. So that's that's one critical thing
[6309.30 --> 6313.46]  Um, the other issue is that i'm not saying the humanoid robot market isn't coming
[6313.94 --> 6317.62]  I'm saying it's not coming at 200 to 300 000 a unit
[6318.18 --> 6323.14]  That's the problem. It's absolutely human robots are gonna be enormous. Yeah, it's gonna be huge money to you
[6323.14 --> 6326.26]  It's gonna be freaking huge huge the issue
[6326.82 --> 6328.82]  Is that specifically optimus
[6329.46 --> 6330.10]  is
[6330.10 --> 6332.10]  so far behind
[6332.10 --> 6339.22]  And way way too expensive. That's the problem. I'm talking specifically about optimus nothing that they've
[6339.22 --> 6340.18]  Shown me gives me any
[6340.18 --> 6344.66]  Optimism about how that program is going to proceed and
[6345.22 --> 6345.86]  I can be wrong
[6345.86 --> 6348.90]  It's happened before optimus could end up being
[6349.46 --> 6352.98]  10 times better than what's coming out of other robotics company
[6352.98 --> 6355.70]  I mean, I haven't even talked about boston dynamics at this point like
[6356.66 --> 6357.86]  optimus is
[6357.86 --> 6358.18]  so
[6358.82 --> 6360.34]  Far behind right now
[6360.90 --> 6365.14]  Um, and and they could magically catch up and that is that is a possibility and if i'm wrong
[6365.14 --> 6368.10]  I will I will say I was wrong optimus
[6369.38 --> 6370.90]  Is the prime robot?
[6371.54 --> 6373.94]  Um, I just I don't see a path to it right now. That's all
[6374.50 --> 6374.90]  Okay
[6375.78 --> 6376.90]  So this is from
[6379.94 --> 6382.50]  This is from luke and sammy tour the ifa show floor
[6383.06 --> 6386.02]  I'm not gonna bother get dan to get the audio going or anything
[6386.66 --> 6387.06]  um
[6387.94 --> 6390.26]  But you can see here when he zooms in
[6390.82 --> 6394.26]  So this is a little bit blurry because we're like zoomed in over the crowd
[6394.90 --> 6396.26]  But you can see a hook here
[6396.90 --> 6398.34]  And then a wire that goes up
[6399.54 --> 6402.10]  And behind the play button there's another hook
[6402.58 --> 6406.42]  There we go you can see on both of his shoulders there's hooks nice and then wires going up
[6406.66 --> 6411.86]  He's being held up by the airplane cables to the ceiling so it can't stand on its own
[6412.10 --> 6413.70]  There's three baskets here on the bottom
[6413.70 --> 6416.66]  You can see the one in the middle has actually like a bunch of clothes in it
[6416.66 --> 6421.30]  And then one on each side the the basket on from our perspective the right is
[6422.34 --> 6423.70]  For like plain
[6425.30 --> 6427.46]  I would say you're probably closer to center my god
[6428.98 --> 6433.94]  From our perspective the right the the bat that basket is for plain whites and then the
[6434.90 --> 6440.90]  Basket on the left is for colored fabrics. Oh my god. The middle is the unsworded. Hamnetics says that's robot at bernie's
[6440.90 --> 6446.58]  Look how slow it is
[6447.30 --> 6449.30]  Oh, man
[6449.62 --> 6454.34]  What is the possible use of this? I mean I get it the point is to show progress and then look fail
[6455.94 --> 6461.22]  Yeah, and try again wait this is in real time. This is not slow-mo. This is in real time
[6461.30 --> 6465.38]  It actually footage skipped there for a second. I think sammy cut some of it out because it was so boring
[6465.38 --> 6469.14]  Oh, yeah, and then this one it it has like a hard time getting it out of the basket
[6470.66 --> 6472.66]  So it takes this whole time and
[6473.46 --> 6480.42]  Okay, it finally got it then it goes again. It's so rough. It takes forever. Oh, man
[6483.62 --> 6488.66]  The company is neuro robotics. Yeah, I don't know and you know, maybe they have something else that's good
[6488.82 --> 6490.82]  I don't know whatever it's just
[6491.46 --> 6496.10]  That was that was like tough to watch I I would not have brought that to a show to show it off
[6496.82 --> 6502.66]  Personally, I mean it depends where you started maybe maybe you know, maybe six months ago
[6502.66 --> 6506.02]  It couldn't pick up the clothes at all. Maybe this is progress sure
[6508.10 --> 6509.14]  and
[6509.38 --> 6511.38]  You know, I'm not super
[6511.62 --> 6513.14]  informed on
[6513.14 --> 6520.18]  Robotics right now. Maybe that is good for some reason like maybe it was doing something somehow that was good for some reason
[6520.18 --> 6523.06]  And you wanted investors or something because if is a weird show
[6523.70 --> 6525.70]  There's a really wide
[6525.70 --> 6529.06]  I've never been actually of yeah, so there's first time. This is my first time
[6530.02 --> 6531.86]  there was genuinely just like
[6533.30 --> 6534.58]  General public
[6534.58 --> 6543.86]  Wanted to go see stuff for funsies people there there was people that were like definitely buying for like european stores that needed stock for things
[6544.50 --> 6544.90]  Um
[6545.70 --> 6548.02]  So, you know, maybe there was investors there as well
[6548.02 --> 6548.50]  I don't know
[6548.50 --> 6553.94]  Avon fox and float plane chat says it's actually pretty astounding that it can adapt to something like fabric
[6554.58 --> 6558.10]  As a tech demo. It's amazing as a product. It's obviously not yeah, and let's see
[6558.10 --> 6563.22]  Okay, so fair enough and maybe they're looking for investors. They're looking to hire people or whatever. I don't know what the objective was
[6563.46 --> 6565.46]  I'm used to going to
[6565.46 --> 6566.98]  CES where they're trying to
[6567.70 --> 6569.70]  Sell or get in the media, right?
[6569.70 --> 6573.70]  Yeah, so this might have actually been a different objective, and I'm just not used to it. So you know what?
[6573.70 --> 6575.70]  I'm not trying to go after the company. I just
[6577.06 --> 6583.94]  Oof that's all as a product right now, which it isn't in its defense forget IFA more like OOFA
[6584.10 --> 6584.98]  Yeah, OOFA
[6585.46 --> 6592.66]  Yeah, have you seen some of the um some of the footage from the like robot the first robot olympics that they held in china?
[6593.62 --> 6595.94]  Some of it's really impressive most of it's really funny
[6595.94 --> 6597.94]  um
[6598.98 --> 6604.10]  This is I don't think this is from the robot olympics, but this is from like a robot martial arts fight
[6604.50 --> 6606.50]  Uh, this one falls under funny
[6612.58 --> 6614.58]  This is from the independent
[6616.50 --> 6620.42]  There's so much more you guys are gonna have to go really funny you guys are gonna have to go check this out
[6620.42 --> 6626.10]  Yeah, um, they're also just like shadow boxing like 15 20 feet away from each other just
[6626.90 --> 6627.86]  before they actually
[6628.82 --> 6629.86]  Get close enough to
[6630.58 --> 6634.66]  I don't know maybe land a blow. I don't know if they ever actually do land any hits on each other
[6635.14 --> 6636.98]  Um, anyway, it's it's it's cute
[6636.98 --> 6640.98]  um
[6643.78 --> 6646.10]  Oh float plane announcement. What's the float plane announcement?
[6646.10 --> 6651.86]  It's down. Oh, okay. I moved it so you wouldn't yell at me. Well, then I couldn't find it dan
[6652.42 --> 6655.38]  Did you ever think of that? Oh, wow. Oh my god
[6656.50 --> 6659.46]  We did it. We did a seven hour
[6660.26 --> 6663.94]  Director's commentary for scrapyard wars 10
[6664.50 --> 6665.54]  uh, it's with
[6666.26 --> 6669.62]  uh games master david as well as basically
[6670.18 --> 6675.62]  Everyone except me and luke so that's Hoffman the editor. I'm in like 10 minutes of it. They had me call in. Oh, are you in it?
[6675.62 --> 6677.46]  Oh, cool. They didn't they didn't ask me
[6678.18 --> 6680.02]  um, you didn't blatantly cheat
[6681.62 --> 6685.30]  What? Hey, we didn't know. I didn't cheat. We didn't know. No, apparently we did
[6687.06 --> 6691.62]  We thought we got permission for something and david thinks we did not. I'm glad we uh
[6692.18 --> 6695.78]  I swear we did what got permission for what? Uh, don't worry about it
[6695.78 --> 6701.62]  No, if you want to know you should watch the director's commentary. If you want to know you gotta subscribe to Flo Plane and watch seven hours of video
[6701.94 --> 6703.94]  What do you mean?
[6704.90 --> 6707.22]  We lost uh spoilers I guess
[6708.10 --> 6710.18]  Uh, what do you well hold on a second
[6712.10 --> 6716.66]  Uh, I thought linus knew I didn't mean to open this worm can
[6717.14 --> 6724.98]  Uh, I'm reading the comments. I don't know if it's even in there. Usually the comments will tell me what was in the video
[6725.78 --> 6727.78]  Control F
[6728.10 --> 6730.10]  Control F
[6730.10 --> 6730.82]  The comments are about
[6731.78 --> 6732.82]  You cheating
[6734.26 --> 6739.78]  Next time dan should be on linus's team and do the same amount of cheating
[6741.94 --> 6749.86]  So dan knows the answer oh no, we both know the answer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I thought you were aware before okay dan
[6749.86 --> 6751.86]  I
[6752.82 --> 6757.14]  I mean we talked to david about this talk to david about what we super talked to david about it
[6757.14 --> 6761.38]  But there was there must have been a miscommunication about something then you have to have the camera rolling
[6761.46 --> 6765.22]  So there must have been a miscommunication. I mean you must have had you must have had your tentacle
[6765.46 --> 6769.78]  There was mike packs rolling. Yeah, okay. Well, then where's the where's the audio of you talking to david?
[6770.18 --> 6776.18]  I think it's in the commentary thing. Maybe no, I think uh, I think it was found in the edit and they just kind of brought it up later
[6776.18 --> 6780.10]  I can't quite remember. I don't know. Okay. So what did you guys do?
[6780.10 --> 6781.94]  You gotta watch the the full
[6781.94 --> 6785.38]  I'm not gonna watch the seven hour video to find out the answer to one question
[6786.18 --> 6789.38]  I think it actually was just at the start to be perfectly honest
[6789.94 --> 6790.50]  um
[6790.50 --> 6792.10]  What what happened?
[6792.10 --> 6793.54]  uh, we were like
[6794.66 --> 6798.26]  Hey, somebody at work is getting rid of stuff
[6799.14 --> 6801.14]  Can we get this stuff for them?
[6801.14 --> 6803.14]  Excuse me?
[6805.14 --> 6810.90]  What part of you cannot use your influence but you can ask for anything?
[6812.66 --> 6814.34]  No, you can ask david for anything
[6815.38 --> 6820.90]  What you have super broken the rules like crazy before by asking david what are you talking about?
[6820.90 --> 6824.26]  I don't I could what rule breaking I could go dig up some examples
[6824.42 --> 6825.94]  I mean just in this episode
[6825.94 --> 6827.30]  I think this episode there was a
[6827.30 --> 6830.90]  interpretation that you had to go you had to stay in pairs and you guys sent out one
[6830.90 --> 6831.30]  because you asked david
[6831.30 --> 6835.06]  But it explicitly said in the rules that you can ask for an exception to that
[6835.62 --> 6836.58]  explicitly
[6837.46 --> 6838.82]  What do you mean you don't know?
[6839.46 --> 6845.38]  I didn't know it is it said an exception for that one. Yes, it did. No, I'm not saying it didn't. I just didn't know that. Okay
[6847.22 --> 6853.14]  Dude, that's been a rule of scrapyard wars for years. You cannot use your influence
[6853.14 --> 6859.14]  And I would say asking a friend or co-worker or family member falls pretty clearly
[6859.14 --> 6863.78]  No, no, it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't asking they were going to give it away for free
[6864.02 --> 6864.58]  anyways
[6865.22 --> 6869.46]  So it was like could we know the that's why we clarified it whereabouts or something
[6870.74 --> 6874.58]  And then acquire it that way. It's a very good thing
[6875.62 --> 6876.74]  that
[6876.74 --> 6885.30]  You know what whatever it's been out for like over a week now. It's a very good thing that you guys lost
[6886.02 --> 6887.62]  See I thought it was because
[6888.18 --> 6892.66]  Crazy, I thought it was crazy. I thought he's gonna say no no matter what and then when he said yes
[6893.22 --> 6896.34]  I thought it was because we must have been getting stomped and he was trying to like
[6896.98 --> 6900.50]  Showrunner it and make it closer. Oh, yeah, same. I think what we
[6900.50 --> 6908.34]  We just like seven hour video. He was on so many like painkillers. Yeah, and I think there was just a miscommunication, but we did ask
[6909.06 --> 6909.94]  um
[6909.94 --> 6911.62]  So, yeah, whatever
[6911.62 --> 6916.58]  Because my thing was like there's no way that's gonna fly but you can ask if you want I think we'll be way more careful
[6917.14 --> 6919.70]  Yeah, sure. Yeah, if there is a next year
[6920.74 --> 6921.86]  Luke banned
[6921.86 --> 6923.86]  Dan banned. That is
[6923.86 --> 6925.38]  wild
[6925.38 --> 6927.78]  That is wild because I mean
[6928.82 --> 6934.74]  Dude, dude, I I mean I got I got I got friends, you know, I could be like hey shroud
[6934.74 --> 6940.50]  No, no, no. Do you have any old gaming PCs you're planning to give away? There was no asking. There was no asking involved
[6943.86 --> 6948.82]  I thought that might have been what made it okay. I still he I think he just didn't understand what we were saying
[6949.22 --> 6951.94]  Probably because he was on painkillers. It's whatever. Okay
[6951.94 --> 6957.06]  So what did you get it was the speakers or something speakers?
[6957.06 --> 6960.50]  So that's how you got a speaker set up for free
[6961.06 --> 6965.14]  Yeah, I mean I got a speaker set up in the last graphic works for free. That was arguably better
[6967.30 --> 6969.30]  So
[6970.02 --> 6975.30]  I also actually thought that's why he okayed it was because it's like actually not that hard to get audio stuff for super cheap
[6975.30 --> 6977.30]  I had to pay for it
[6977.30 --> 6983.78]  Literally last guy you got good stuff wicked audio setup with an amp and everything if you remember that that was all was it free?
[6983.78 --> 6988.66]  Or was it like I think it was almost free like like three dollars or something like
[6989.22 --> 6993.94]  I'm reminiscing about last time, but we're not talking about last time. Luke. We're talking about this time
[6994.82 --> 6996.82]  oh, man, that is
[6998.18 --> 7005.06]  And look look I understand that there were a fair number of folks upset about the fact that my pc was not powered on
[7005.06 --> 7009.70]  Oh, no, we talked about that as well totally we talked about that as well
[7009.70 --> 7011.22]  We were talking about racing rules
[7011.22 --> 7012.42]  I don't think it should have been
[7012.90 --> 7015.94]  But I also don't think I should have been able to do a game service thing
[7016.18 --> 7018.18]  But both of those were totally within the rules
[7018.18 --> 7020.98]  There's definitely some stuff we're gonna have to revise about the rules
[7020.98 --> 7024.42]  But the thing about scrapyard wars is it has always been
[7025.22 --> 7027.22]  the letter of the law
[7027.22 --> 7027.94]  and
[7027.94 --> 7030.42]  what you can get away with to win
[7030.42 --> 7031.94]  Yeah, I thought that I thought the
[7031.94 --> 7038.10]  Computer in the corner was clever more than anything. It didn't bother me. Oh, yeah, that was amazing. I wanted to make it furniture
[7039.46 --> 7041.38]  So I wanted a table talk for it
[7043.54 --> 7044.82]  That would have been great. See like that
[7045.54 --> 7047.46]  That made it into the cut. That's awesome
[7047.86 --> 7054.02]  If if if people did see it's a I think they released it on lmg clips, maybe but I know it was a full
[7054.02 --> 7056.34]  Hold on a second. Hold on a second
[7056.34 --> 7061.70]  They doc in the float plane chat chat says you didn't mention the sub
[7063.46 --> 7065.30]  Oh, what about the sub this was?
[7065.30 --> 7066.50]  Oh, yeah, that's right
[7067.06 --> 7069.14]  That probably would have been a bit too far of a stretch
[7069.14 --> 7072.98]  I don't even understand what you guys needed so much money for
[7074.18 --> 7077.46]  Because quite frankly we blew it on a projector that barely works
[7077.94 --> 7079.94]  Yeah, yeah quite quite frankly like I
[7079.94 --> 7086.74]  I I had to dude the the distribution like you guys spent four hundred dollars on a couch
[7086.74 --> 7090.26]  I'm sitting here going like bro, or 350. I don't remember
[7090.26 --> 7094.02]  It was a lot more than ours. I know that
[7094.82 --> 7099.14]  A lot of money lost more points for your couch me. Yeah, I think so
[7099.54 --> 7104.34]  I should have clearly won pull out to be very clear. I'm not trying to I'm not trying to say that it was very uncomfortable
[7104.82 --> 7107.94]  It was horrifically. It was did you sit on the crack?
[7107.94 --> 7115.14]  Oh, yeah, oh dude, even not on the crack. It had the work dude. It was so bad. The crack was truly a
[7116.34 --> 7118.34]  Level of hell
[7119.14 --> 7121.14]  375 bucks
[7121.14 --> 7123.86]  Effectively 400. Yeah, I thought it was three. Did we get a discount?
[7125.14 --> 7130.98]  Like ours was like a hundred or 150 or something. I thought we got it for less than three projectors was 800 bucks. Yeah, that was rough
[7132.26 --> 7133.94]  Crazy I didn't
[7133.94 --> 7137.86]  Yeah, okay, I don't know enough about projectors. I thought
[7138.74 --> 7145.54]  Going the projector play was like super good. Obviously in hindsight. No, but I think we got locked into it
[7145.54 --> 7147.54]  We talked about this a lot during during the
[7148.82 --> 7150.82]  Director's commentary
[7150.82 --> 7155.14]  Okay, I feel like we've gotten off topic. I feel like we've gotten off topic. Tell me about the subwoofer
[7155.14 --> 7157.54]  Oh, that was mine
[7161.14 --> 7161.94]  Okay
[7161.94 --> 7163.14]  That
[7163.14 --> 7170.26]  Is cheating. I think so that is the most cheating is thing of any scrapyard wars
[7170.26 --> 7176.26]  So how did that one fly? I have no idea that is a giant load. Did you ask about that one?
[7176.26 --> 7183.86]  Probably that's a little too blatant for even me because my my general byline was like if you want to do something whack
[7184.10 --> 7186.10]  Just make sure you clear with david
[7186.10 --> 7190.98]  Um, but then I also didn't know that david was on tons of painkillers. No, neither
[7190.98 --> 7192.42]  I wasn't aware of that until
[7193.06 --> 7195.62]  This stream exactly exactly. Oh my god you guys
[7198.18 --> 7200.50]  I'm glad it helped so much
[7201.22 --> 7202.10]  Wow
[7202.10 --> 7207.54]  It's really lucky you guys didn't win because I think that I think I think we would have legitimately been mad
[7207.54 --> 7209.14]  I think we would have been dq'd at this point
[7210.02 --> 7211.22]  Oh, yeah, absolutely
[7212.02 --> 7214.18]  We've never have we ever disqualified anyone?
[7214.74 --> 7217.38]  No, and there's been really egregious cheating in the past
[7218.18 --> 7223.30]  I don't think as bad as just bringing parts from home probably not. I don't even remember what they were but probably not. No
[7224.34 --> 7227.70]  Wait, yeah, that can't we almost disqualify kyle?
[7228.34 --> 7232.02]  What did he do? I don't remember. Oh, didn't they just fully actually cheat?
[7232.10 --> 7237.54]  No, paul and kyle in that thing. I thought they did I thought they super did
[7237.54 --> 7240.82]  I don't think so did they they wouldn't cheat does anyone remember?
[7240.82 --> 7244.74]  I haven't watched any of the old scrapyard paul and kyle were outright dq'd yeah, okay
[7244.98 --> 7250.98]  I thought something happened. Okay, apparently apparently we have disqualified someone before what did they do?
[7251.38 --> 7255.38]  I don't remember, but I remember like something happened
[7255.38 --> 7260.82]  Uh
[7261.38 --> 7266.90]  They did they super did they screwed themselves with vsync. What are you guys even talking about? Okay, I don't I don't remember
[7267.46 --> 7269.46]  We need a cheating addition. I
[7271.70 --> 7273.70]  They used their own drive
[7274.26 --> 7275.70]  Oh, yeah
[7275.70 --> 7280.02]  Yeah, yeah, because their drive died or something, right? Yeah, so it was actually good for like the video
[7280.82 --> 7284.82]  Yeah, and they're able to present because I because didn't did they win damn?
[7284.82 --> 7285.78]  I can't remember anymore
[7285.78 --> 7291.70]  I don't we have to go back and actually like check our win-loss records because I think I think we're pretty close to even now
[7291.70 --> 7293.70]  You might still be ahead of me
[7293.70 --> 7298.34]  He's gonna be wicked closer tied. He's like
[7299.94 --> 7301.06]  Pissed no, I am
[7302.26 --> 7309.30]  Because I I see it as like old gen and new gen have I told have I explained this to you before no, I haven't because there's a huge gap
[7310.58 --> 7313.62]  A gap there's a massive time gap. Oh, I see
[7313.86 --> 7320.34]  So I see it as old generation scrappy wars and new generations. Okay, sure and in new generation scrappy red wars i'm oh and two
[7320.34 --> 7326.50]  What you only count so you don't count the one with the team counting it?
[7326.82 --> 7334.18]  I'm, just just looking at this split. Oh, so since the scrapyard wars pause. Yeah, you're seeing it as like the reboot
[7334.42 --> 7341.14]  Yeah, so in the reason the reboot i'm oh and two that's funny. I'm both of them honestly weren't that close which is like
[7341.94 --> 7343.06]  Bad
[7343.06 --> 7349.06]  It's not great. No, it's not this last season was by far in my opinion my worst showing ever
[7349.78 --> 7352.42]  Maybe next time spend more time sleeping
[7352.90 --> 7357.86]  Uh, not launching a platform the same week. I tried yeah, no, I know no no
[7358.90 --> 7363.30]  I really appreciate everything humanly possible. They actually for context for the viewership
[7363.46 --> 7366.50]  They actually moved scrapyard wars a whole week for me
[7367.06 --> 7373.78]  And then he wouldn't have the overlap and then the launch just got delayed and so so like I literally sleep. I don't remember
[7373.78 --> 7375.30]  I
[7375.30 --> 7380.34]  A very low amount of hours over the entire thing. I think it was like 16 hours over five days
[7380.66 --> 7384.90]  I think it was less than that. I might have and I know like the first day of shooting
[7384.90 --> 7386.74]  Like you see us throwing the money up and stuff
[7386.74 --> 7392.50]  I had been awake for over 30 hours while we were filming that so that was the day he decided to buy a projector
[7392.82 --> 7395.22]  Yeah, like and then we just kind of ran
[7395.22 --> 7396.26]  I have no idea
[7396.26 --> 7401.22]  It was you know, it was honestly if you guys had executed on it perfectly
[7401.22 --> 7402.74]  I think you could have won
[7402.74 --> 7406.26]  I can't clever concept. I can't understate how
[7407.70 --> 7412.90]  Like we got from not having them out because because actually
[7414.02 --> 7416.18]  Everyone's time went into
[7416.74 --> 7420.58]  Setting the mount up and I know the people who actually did the mount stuff gonna be like what that's not fair
[7420.98 --> 7424.66]  It is because then that meant like drive places. Yeah
[7424.66 --> 7430.98]  And but you know what's you know, what the funny part is it was it was so rough. I don't really understand
[7431.62 --> 7433.62]  um
[7433.62 --> 7434.34]  And
[7434.34 --> 7439.30]  I mean, I don't mean any disrespect. I know that in in a time of like, you know
[7439.30 --> 7443.22]  Frantically trying to problem solve sometimes you can come up with not the best solutions
[7443.78 --> 7444.98]  but like
[7444.98 --> 7446.74]  Why did you guys try to 3d print a mount?
[7447.38 --> 7448.98]  Why didn't you just go get a piece of wood?
[7449.70 --> 7451.38]  and just like
[7451.46 --> 7454.26]  Screw the piece of wood into the thing and then just like
[7455.06 --> 7460.34]  Put it on a freaking like hinge or something like why did you try to why did you try to 3d print a mount?
[7461.22 --> 7462.18]  Put it on a hinge
[7462.66 --> 7467.30]  Like literally just literally just put a freaking get a piece of wood
[7467.70 --> 7470.50]  And literally put a big screw into it and freaking bend it
[7470.82 --> 7475.14]  You know like if you're gonna be jank just like just jank it. Yeah, we probably should have done that
[7475.78 --> 7477.22]  um
[7477.30 --> 7479.14]  I don't know but like how much time do you think?
[7479.14 --> 7480.34]  Or put the projector on a shelf
[7481.06 --> 7483.06]  I didn't even think of that one which goes to show like you don't
[7483.06 --> 7485.70]  Just a shelf yeah, yeah, why don't you just put it on a shelf?
[7485.70 --> 7487.54]  Why don't we do shelf then?
[7487.54 --> 7490.18]  Uh, they wouldn't go and buy one
[7490.66 --> 7493.30]  I got us free shelving so I don't think that makes sense
[7493.30 --> 7498.58]  How much time do you think got spent between you and justin on on them on the mount and mounting it?
[7499.06 --> 7501.46]  I um, I wasn't involved in the mount
[7501.78 --> 7502.58]  um
[7502.58 --> 7504.58]  Well, you're mounting it took like
[7504.58 --> 7508.18]  And you read the 3d print at some point, right?
[7508.50 --> 7512.58]  No, I had to modify it kind of last day because yeah, yeah
[7513.22 --> 7515.46]  Um, no, no comment really
[7516.02 --> 7522.66]  Um, Chris app says yeah people 3d print things for all kinds of stuff that would be easier if you just didn't 3d print it
[7522.66 --> 7526.42]  Well, no, that's a thing for sure, but it like it it literally took
[7526.42 --> 7531.06]  It took like a person and a half out of the competition for us really?
[7531.06 --> 7535.86]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, like I I I genuinely cannot overstate how
[7536.42 --> 7542.02]  Devastating that was would have been a lot better to just go to a home depot buy some screws and hinges and things sure
[7542.66 --> 7546.02]  Alexander the terrible asks and you clarify what the rules were for tools
[7546.02 --> 7548.98]  So people can stop saying line is cheated for using a freaking paint roller
[7548.98 --> 7553.06]  Uh, the rules are that we're allowed to use any tools that we could realistically
[7553.06 --> 7562.26]  Have access to in the office and one one 3d printer and no printer there was also you were allowed to use your own tools
[7562.66 --> 7564.66]  Okay
[7565.06 --> 7569.30]  Tool use was not the problem. Yeah at all, but it was but materials
[7570.10 --> 7577.30]  Counted yes, except you had unlimited filament for one printer for one printer. Yeah. Yeah, and only one printer and only one
[7577.30 --> 7582.98]  Because that's the limiting factor not the plastic. Yeah, um, I didn't realize that we were allowed to mount stuff
[7583.06 --> 7587.86]  To the walls with like they would give us backing wood like if you wanted to mount a tv
[7587.86 --> 7592.98]  Yeah, I had no idea that was a thing until they mentioned it in the stream. Did you know that was a thing?
[7593.78 --> 7594.66]  Yeah, okay
[7595.94 --> 7597.38]  So none of the contestants knew
[7597.38 --> 7602.66]  I would have mounted a tv to the wall though. The reason why I asked if you knew it was a thing and was pretty sure you didn't
[7602.66 --> 7606.66]  It was because obviously you would have done that. No, I wouldn't have. Wait, really? I didn't have money
[7606.66 --> 7610.50]  I couldn't afford a mount dude. I had I had a dollar 38 left
[7611.78 --> 7612.98]  like
[7612.98 --> 7613.94]  We
[7613.94 --> 7616.74]  Dude, yeah, we were down to no offense, but we
[7617.54 --> 7622.50]  Scrapped harder than you guys. We didn't scrap at all actually. Yeah, like you guys paid like you guys
[7622.66 --> 7626.58]  You guys paid a fortune for your rug. You guys paid a fortune for your couch
[7626.66 --> 7629.38]  I think we paid we paid a lot less than you for a rug. I think did you
[7630.02 --> 7631.22]  I'm looking
[7631.22 --> 7633.22]  Rug rug rug rug rug
[7633.46 --> 7638.74]  Okay, maybe i'm wrong about the rug but the couch the couch is really couch 375. We thought we had tons of money
[7639.30 --> 7644.74]  When we got the rug 25 dollars, okay, you guys slayed on the rug then I found the just like in general dude
[7644.74 --> 7647.94]  Like I was I was watching your side and I was just like, oh my god
[7647.94 --> 7653.22]  Like how do they have all this money and it's because they didn't need a compute device?
[7653.62 --> 7657.46]  Well, yeah, like we we spent almost 400 on a playstation
[7658.02 --> 7660.50]  112 we bought movies
[7661.30 --> 7663.30]  Okay, so there's been a lot of talk about the
[7664.18 --> 7666.02]  Shadow thing as well and I feel
[7667.22 --> 7672.50]  Pretty bad for shadow. Yeah, they got kind of boned by just our internet being sucked that day
[7672.50 --> 7676.42]  I I wish it was explained a little bit better. It was explained decently well
[7676.42 --> 7681.06]  But I wish there was like almost a disclaimer on screen of how much testing I did
[7681.62 --> 7685.22]  Because this was very explicitly communicated through david and I think this was actually fine
[7685.46 --> 7689.46]  He let me do testing of it when it was acting weird outside of ours
[7689.46 --> 7693.78]  Um, I wasn't allowed to actually work on like my own system, right?
[7693.78 --> 7696.90]  But I could run shadow at my house and be like is it working?
[7697.46 --> 7703.70]  Right and I could like go to friends houses and be like run shadow is it working and it was working
[7703.70 --> 7706.90]  Perfectly fine the entire week
[7706.90 --> 7708.90]  I don't think
[7708.90 --> 7713.14]  I don't think this is in the eula necessarily
[7713.14 --> 7717.38]  But I was sharing the heck out of my account with like everyone I knew getting right on it from
[7717.94 --> 7721.38]  Everywhere they could at all times and day and there was literally
[7722.10 --> 7724.74]  Never a problem except for at our office
[7724.74 --> 7731.38]  And there's something with how our firewall is set up. I don't remember sean was trying to work on it
[7731.78 --> 7734.98]  I mean, that's I think that's why our adventure time stream looked like crap, too
[7735.22 --> 7741.06]  Probably it was terrible. It looked like 240p. There's something weird and I know that's like literally my department
[7741.06 --> 7747.22]  LOL, but there's something weird with with how that set up and that totally new shadow that is that is not I know
[7747.22 --> 7749.22]  There was some comments being like oh
[7749.22 --> 7753.62]  This is just what streaming experiences like no and there are some issues there
[7753.62 --> 7759.86]  But no but not at this level like at all we have like like an enterprise grade connection here
[7760.02 --> 7762.34]  It's like I forget what the exact whole thing is
[7762.34 --> 7768.98]  But basically it's it's the closest thing to if we had a dedicated fiber line without actually having our own fiber run through the street
[7769.62 --> 7771.30]  three of them there is no
[7771.86 --> 7776.58]  Reason why we should have anything but the cleanest possible connection to vanix
[7776.98 --> 7783.30]  Which should have the cleanest possible connection. I had somebody on a copper 100 100 line. Yeah, that ran it great
[7783.86 --> 7785.06]  on like a
[7785.06 --> 7787.06]  eight-year-old computer
[7787.06 --> 7787.54]  like
[7787.54 --> 7789.54]  This was not
[7789.54 --> 7794.74]  It was not shadow. Yeah, so like a it was just bad luck. I the projector
[7795.46 --> 7797.46]  All right, cool. Yeah, I
[7798.74 --> 7802.50]  Did not executive decision that call just to be very clear
[7802.50 --> 7804.50]  Yeah, um
[7804.58 --> 7809.78]  But we were we were also saying like, you know sports if only I had made that pass
[7810.26 --> 7814.98]  Yeah, if only I had trained a bit harder if only I didn't come to work drunk if only I
[7816.74 --> 7820.58]  You know, it's like you can go you can go look back forever in in highlights
[7820.58 --> 7824.98]  Yeah, like the projector. I I wish we didn't make that call shadow
[7824.98 --> 7828.90]  You guys could have gotten away with the projector if you had also painted the room
[7829.54 --> 7836.58]  I can't I originally wanted to do silver screen room, but there's so much and I don't think we should necessarily talk about it on stream
[7836.58 --> 7839.30]  Uh, but there is a lot of reasons and stuff. Yeah
[7839.30 --> 7844.42]  We don't really want to go into right now. I can't explain how torpedoed the team got when we didn't get them out
[7844.90 --> 7845.86]  it
[7845.86 --> 7847.54]  When I'm saying a person and a half
[7848.42 --> 7853.14]  At least a person and a half were just removed from the competition when we didn't get that mount. That's rough
[7853.22 --> 7856.58]  And yeah, we should have just mounted it in an easier way, whatever
[7856.82 --> 7860.26]  I also don't even I mean I watched the interaction where they picked it up
[7860.26 --> 7865.22]  I don't even blame them for taking the projector because you guys had decided on the projector and you did say get the mount
[7865.62 --> 7867.30]  but like also like
[7868.26 --> 7871.54]  You're trying to you're trying to like you're under you're under time constraint
[7872.18 --> 7875.62]  Like I understand why they made the call to just take it anyway and go yeah
[7875.62 --> 7879.14]  We can figure out a mount because it can't be that hard. I didn't know there was a mount
[7879.70 --> 7883.14]  Properly, you know, otherwise it would have been like no we need them out
[7883.70 --> 7885.70]  But I hear you it was communicated
[7885.70 --> 7887.94]  But even then I wouldn't assume like okay
[7887.94 --> 7892.18]  Look if somebody sent me to go get a camera and they told me yeah
[7892.18 --> 7896.26]  It doesn't have like the plate that goes under it. I'd be like well. Yeah, I mean i'm still buying the camera
[7896.82 --> 7899.78]  I'll figure out. I'll figure out a plate like that can't be that hard
[7899.78 --> 7905.06]  I wouldn't think that getting a project is that hard the shadow problems. I did work on them outside of ours
[7905.06 --> 7909.14]  I also spent an egregious amount of time working on them inside of ours like between
[7909.78 --> 7911.78]  Right the mount and shadow
[7911.78 --> 7913.78]  we basically had like
[7914.26 --> 7916.26]  Sammy who couldn't drive around by herself
[7916.26 --> 7924.18]  I was about to say sammy was your team's like standout. Oh, she's the only reason we got like any points at all
[7924.74 --> 7927.38]  She didn't like the fact that was given
[7927.94 --> 7931.06]  Nothing, I don't I don't know how well communicated was in the video. She had
[7931.06 --> 7936.42]  I was it like 14 minutes to make the room cool or something your room just went from
[7937.46 --> 7939.30]  casting couch to
[7939.30 --> 7941.14]  inviting lobby
[7941.14 --> 7943.14]  in like
[7943.14 --> 7943.54]  a
[7943.54 --> 7949.54]  Shockingly small amount of time and with very little budget. I remember her very impressed. I need at least 30 minutes
[7949.78 --> 7950.66]  To be clear
[7950.66 --> 7956.10]  I wasn't surprised because I saw what sammy did with the budget that I gave her on the previous season
[7956.10 --> 7960.02]  Which was even less yeah, but I was very impressed. Yeah
[7962.90 --> 7963.78]  Oh lordy
[7964.66 --> 7966.66]  Yeah, she she did great
[7969.06 --> 7970.58]  We we gave her nothing
[7972.58 --> 7977.62]  And she uh, she did good good with okay dunphy says 58 seconds in episode one
[7978.26 --> 7982.18]  Can only use items purchased using the budget linus sold a soundbar
[7982.18 --> 7983.30]  Yes
[7984.42 --> 7989.54]  But I sold a soundbar that I only have because I bought it. I'm completely fine with that
[7989.54 --> 7993.86]  I think that's pretty standard. That's canon at this point that if you can wheel and deal
[7994.42 --> 7998.74]  Yeah, I don't know if that's in the rules or not, but like that is completely fine. I think it's I think it's I think it's
[7998.74 --> 8002.90]  I think it's allowed by legal precedent sure regardless of whether it's in the
[8002.90 --> 8008.74]  I think that is objectively good for the game. Oh, yeah, if you can if you can flip like
[8009.30 --> 8012.50]  Yeah, totally totally cool dude that tv deal saved me
[8013.22 --> 8015.22]  That tv deal was incredible
[8015.62 --> 8018.34]  Watching you watching you wheel for that was so dope
[8019.62 --> 8021.62]  That's actually awesome
[8022.50 --> 8027.06]  Dude, I was I was uh watching it was painful for myself because I was just staring at myself
[8027.54 --> 8029.86]  Doing dumb things. I'm way too freaking tired
[8030.34 --> 8037.70]  Um, and then I could I could see myself in a conversation with someone knowing that behind the the back of my laptop is actually
[8038.02 --> 8039.22]  sauce plus instead of
[8039.86 --> 8045.46]  Scrabbit wars listings. I'm like man, sorry entire team. I kind of screwed everyone over this season, but um
[8046.66 --> 8051.70]  Watching some of your team stuff was cool and that that wheel and dealing for the tv was awesome mcbane
[8052.34 --> 8058.82]  Run the numbers. I never went negative money last season that didn't happen. I thought you went credit card. No
[8059.06 --> 8061.38]  An over budget credit card. No, I didn't go over budget
[8061.46 --> 8066.66]  I had to use money off my credit card because I left the cash somewhere. I wasn't negative budget
[8067.46 --> 8074.90]  I was never out of money. You did. I just had to move it around creatively because it wasn't in the same physical place that I was
[8075.70 --> 8077.70]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[8077.70 --> 8083.30]  All right. I if anything I have been on my best behavior the last couple of seasons
[8083.54 --> 8085.86]  I will say much much better than in the past
[8086.74 --> 8089.30]  Now it's our turn. Hey, look look look look look
[8091.78 --> 8093.78]  I have always
[8093.78 --> 8095.78]  We are the cheaters now
[8096.10 --> 8102.98]  Where did we learn it mom? I've always followed rules. It's just that we used to have much more ill-defined rules
[8102.98 --> 8106.34]  So they were easier to more egregiously skirt
[8107.14 --> 8112.10]  Whereas now we actually for better for worse. We have pretty well-defined rule sets. Yep
[8112.10 --> 8116.26]  So I have to I have to be I think more creative in my
[8116.26 --> 8122.26]  I think what we learned this is the the rules around the pc being required should probably be more explicit
[8122.26 --> 8125.86]  And those were intentionally vague and linus and kind of season
[8125.86 --> 8132.50]  We were talking about racing stuff on the on the live stream like f1 is basically that rule books like 3000 pages
[8132.50 --> 8133.14]  Yeah
[8133.14 --> 8139.54]  And people still are trying to find ways to do what linus did with a computer, which is like part of sport
[8139.54 --> 8141.38]  That's part of sport. Exactly
[8141.38 --> 8143.06]  And it was left vague
[8143.86 --> 8148.02]  For linus to do that and you can do that one time and that's that's good
[8148.26 --> 8151.38]  I don't want to be encouraged to try a shadow solution again
[8151.38 --> 8157.14]  Um, but it was it was neat to try one time. I'm just sad that I really I
[8158.98 --> 8160.34]  We we weren't gonna win
[8161.78 --> 8163.14]  You guys won
[8163.14 --> 8168.10]  I'm not trying to argue that but if shadow and my trophy's super cool this year
[8168.66 --> 8171.14]  If shadow worked, I think it would have been a lot cooler
[8171.94 --> 8174.02]  It would have been closer didn't even know we're gonna get trophies
[8175.14 --> 8178.10]  Oh, I didn't know it's like a trophies. They were surprised to me too because like
[8178.10 --> 8182.98]  The projector was not configured and the speakers lost their configuration so someone
[8183.54 --> 8185.38]  No, no, no, you messed us up too
[8185.86 --> 8187.86]  Um, so when I was testing on my laptop
[8188.74 --> 8191.22]  I was getting 5.1 6.1
[8191.86 --> 8194.02]  Uh, the little pc didn't
[8194.82 --> 8197.78]  Wasn't able to I had a spare little pc. Maybe you should have
[8198.34 --> 8202.10]  Just tried with that in in the in the 10 minutes that I had to test everything
[8202.10 --> 8204.10]  I hate it when mom and dad fight
[8204.10 --> 8206.10]  Shut up!
[8206.10 --> 8207.70]  This is your conversation!
[8207.70 --> 8209.22]  Yeah, get out of here, Linus
[8209.22 --> 8209.70]  Everybody!
[8210.34 --> 8212.66]  We never fought before you were born!
[8213.22 --> 8214.42]  It's your fault!
[8214.42 --> 8218.74]  Ultimately, I was I was captain of the ship. I should have done a better job. It lands on me, but
[8219.06 --> 8222.02]  Oh, you know, you don't have to fall on that sword. No, I think I do
[8222.58 --> 8227.30]  I'm the one that didn't execute on literally anything. I'm just gonna say my team's teamwork was
[8228.34 --> 8232.26]  Immaculate you guys were like no we were dialed no come we were dialed
[8232.26 --> 8235.30]  I had definitely my roughest season and you guys just
[8236.74 --> 8237.70]  Killed it the whole time
[8237.70 --> 8239.30]  My entire team
[8239.30 --> 8243.46]  My entire team MVP like pancras was awesome
[8243.94 --> 8245.22]  Sebastian was awesome
[8245.22 --> 8245.86]  Natalie was awesome
[8245.86 --> 8249.86]  We had some really fantastic team moments too. The fact that we got a room
[8249.86 --> 8251.06]  Oh, dude
[8251.06 --> 8252.18]  Is crazy. Yes
[8252.18 --> 8256.10]  Like I I I the the push through at the end was wild
[8256.58 --> 8258.02]  Um Dan just like
[8258.98 --> 8262.02]  melting plastic knives into the roof
[8263.06 --> 8264.18]  Crazy
[8264.18 --> 8266.82]  I was not particularly happy that I had to do that
[8266.82 --> 8268.66]  But it worked
[8268.66 --> 8269.86]  But it worked
[8269.86 --> 8271.30]  I mean country girls make do right
[8271.30 --> 8276.66]  My god, I don't know if everyone's gonna get that reference
[8278.74 --> 8282.26]  You gotta get there you gotta get there somewhere like we're not going to lose
[8282.90 --> 8285.22]  Or we're not going to we're not gonna dnf
[8285.22 --> 8286.50]  We're not going to
[8287.06 --> 8291.30]  We're gonna show up for for the game right because we after after like
[8292.10 --> 8293.22]  Yeah
[8293.22 --> 8296.34]  There was a there was a moment where I was thrown a crazy curveball
[8296.34 --> 8300.66]  Where I was informed that my little mini pc idea would not work
[8301.22 --> 8303.06]  and then I lost hours to
[8304.66 --> 8309.94]  Re-realizing oh, no, my idea was actually fine the mini pc would work and then I so I lost a lot of time with that
[8310.50 --> 8315.70]  And then I lost I lost at least half a day to that which probably wouldn't have lost that much if I was awake
[8316.26 --> 8322.82]  um, and then I lost an enormous amount of time like almost all the rest of my time trying to figure out shadow or driving
[8323.46 --> 8324.82]  That was like all the rest of it
[8325.78 --> 8327.78]  So I was not very
[8327.94 --> 8333.70]  Useful angry panda pc and float plane chat says haley luke at least you had a very entertaining team
[8333.78 --> 8340.02]  I think so you did have that you guys were very entertaining to watch if I tried to detach myself and and watch
[8341.22 --> 8344.50]  As if I wasn't in the show. I thought our team was was
[8345.38 --> 8348.66]  Dan specifically was very very entertaining roman asks
[8349.46 --> 8353.30]  Who threw harder luke throwing the game or dan throwing the projector?
[8354.82 --> 8357.94]  Oh, but he caught it dan dropping that projector
[8357.94 --> 8367.78]  That was like one of the craziest scrapyard wars moments ever if I remember correctly like you holding half of your team's entire budget
[8367.78 --> 8369.78]  and
[8369.78 --> 8377.38]  I also fell over the rest of the audio system including the av receiver and literally everything else
[8377.38 --> 8381.30]  Yeah, so in one tiny little move I could have destroyed all of our equipment
[8381.70 --> 8382.18]  um
[8382.18 --> 8386.02]  I thought it was gonna fall through the wall because it's like paper thin
[8386.66 --> 8392.50]  Uh, but no, it seemed okay. I crushed it against the wall of my hand and that broke its fall so good
[8392.50 --> 8396.98]  I heard you told the legs for a little bit about it and then I was not gonna tell you anything about it
[8397.22 --> 8399.22]  Yeah, I think you told me that you bled
[8399.46 --> 8403.62]  But that i'd have to watch it in the edit and then watching the edit the whole time. It was just like oh
[8406.74 --> 8411.86]  That was amazing. I think people didn't because we were talking in canadian dollars
[8411.86 --> 8417.06]  I think people didn't fully understand how good my tv deal was by the way. This is what I paid
[8417.06 --> 8423.30]  Dude, your playstation deal was insane. That was a great deal. The playstation deal on the tv deal were crazy
[8423.78 --> 8428.26]  For so that was another thing that people didn't fully appreciate was my price on the playstation
[8428.26 --> 8433.54]  Yeah, why is london so excited about this price because I paid canadian freaking dollars. Put 400 bucks in there
[8433.78 --> 8439.62]  Because because what's communicated to the audience at the beginning of the episode I think is that we have fourteen hundred dollars or whatever
[8439.78 --> 8444.02]  Yes, but then the whole time we're actually talking. In CAD, two thousand dollars. We're talking about two thousand dollars
[8444.02 --> 8447.54]  So it's a little confusing. How much did I pay for the playstation again? Was it 400?
[8447.54 --> 8450.50]  400 bucks. Yeah, CAD to usd. So I paid
[8451.70 --> 8456.82]  288 us dollars for a playstation 5 when I saw that in the episode. I was like that's
[8457.46 --> 8465.54]  Just two dual senses. I hear 460 and I got even 460 460. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Let's fix it
[8465.54 --> 8469.62]  I paid 460 460 with the three games though and two controllers. I paid
[8469.62 --> 8476.82]  332 dollars for a ps5 two dual senses and three games one of the games I sold for like 20 bucks
[8476.82 --> 8480.34]  I think 15 or 20 dollars so I actually paid like
[8481.30 --> 8484.90]  320 bucks us for a ps5 and two dual senses
[8485.54 --> 8488.82]  um and then for the tv I paid
[8489.86 --> 8493.46]  396 us dollars for a 75 inch tv
[8493.46 --> 8495.46]  Yeah, when I think
[8495.46 --> 8500.66]  I paid like $200 MSRP so 150 us dollar soundbar that I sold for a hundred Canadian dollars
[8501.30 --> 8502.34]  So I paid like
[8503.14 --> 8505.14]  320 dollars
[8505.14 --> 8505.94]  Yeah, when I think
[8505.94 --> 8506.90]  For a 75 inch tv
[8506.90 --> 8508.50]  First of all, Pankrat's watching right now
[8508.50 --> 8510.98]  I had no idea you were the guy at the shipping can
[8511.22 --> 8512.90]  From that. I had no idea that was him
[8513.54 --> 8514.66]  That was nuts
[8514.66 --> 8515.94]  I didn't know that
[8515.94 --> 8516.50]  No, no one
[8516.50 --> 8517.22]  Until he told me
[8517.22 --> 8520.18]  No one told me until I was just watching the episode
[8521.06 --> 8523.06]  And I was like wait
[8523.54 --> 8524.26]  What?
[8524.26 --> 8527.22]  And then obviously it was like obvious when watching the episode again
[8527.22 --> 8530.66]  So David Pankrat's from my team this year
[8530.66 --> 8534.02]  Is the guy who gave Luke his free pc last year
[8534.02 --> 8535.46]  I didn't use any of it but
[8535.46 --> 8536.42]  Well, whatever
[8536.98 --> 8537.30]  Um
[8538.26 --> 8540.02]  So that that was nuts and then
[8540.02 --> 8542.02]  When when he was like selling the soundbar
[8542.58 --> 8544.66]  And the guy offered a hundred bucks or whatever
[8544.66 --> 8547.38]  And then I think he tried contacting you to like see if it was cool or not
[8547.38 --> 8548.74]  I was like, oh my god, just take it
[8548.74 --> 8551.30]  I was worried he was gonna not get the deal
[8552.26 --> 8554.42]  And then we got an offer on it really fast
[8554.42 --> 8555.54]  People were like
[8555.54 --> 8556.98]  Because it was brand new in box, right?
[8556.98 --> 8558.42]  That's always my concern
[8558.42 --> 8559.78]  With trying to resell
[8559.78 --> 8561.78]  Is if it doesn't work out you can be kind of screwed
[8561.78 --> 8564.26]  But that tv was probably worth buying anyway
[8564.26 --> 8566.90]  Last season we ran into like
[8566.90 --> 8568.10]  We ran into trouble
[8568.10 --> 8571.54]  Where we used far more than what we had budgeted for the pc
[8571.54 --> 8574.82]  And we had like two full computers worth of stuff
[8574.82 --> 8577.54]  And people were like grinding me on the price
[8577.54 --> 8579.86]  Trying to get me to bundle basically all of it for like
[8580.90 --> 8582.90]  Well realistically it was about what I paid anyway
[8582.90 --> 8584.26]  So I wasn't gonna lose money but
[8585.22 --> 8589.46]  But but I was but I was stressed because I was like I wanted to get rid of it for like a decent price
[8589.46 --> 8591.46]  I wish we'd sold you the cpu last year
[8592.98 --> 8595.54]  When you guys wanted to buy it and we thought you were just messing with us
[8595.54 --> 8597.70]  Oh, that would have been so funny
[8597.70 --> 8598.50]  That would have been funny
[8598.50 --> 8603.14]  That would have been a first for scrapyard wars is one team actually buying an item from the other team
[8603.14 --> 8605.30]  Yeah, I hope it happens someday
[8605.30 --> 8606.66]  I'm not gonna force it
[8606.66 --> 8608.90]  No, no, no, but I hope it happens organically someday
[8608.90 --> 8609.78]  That would be very funny
[8609.78 --> 8612.18]  Oh, man
[8612.18 --> 8615.78]  Anyway, if you want to see us talk about this for seven hours straight
[8615.78 --> 8616.74]  Oh, yeah, right, we should move on
[8616.74 --> 8617.86]  Check out the floatplane episode
[8617.86 --> 8618.74]  Floatplane episode
[8618.74 --> 8624.90]  Uh, oh also there's another floatplane exclusive this week, uh, luke and sammy visit ifa that is wow
[8624.90 --> 8626.90]  That is quite the thumbnail. We did that on purpose
[8627.54 --> 8629.14]  Okay, uh
[8629.94 --> 8634.98]  Yeah, ball people like I was talking about heck. Yeah, I was talking about how with sammy
[8634.98 --> 8640.90]  I was talking about how thumbnails with mouth open get less views really and then he was like it's floatplane. Let's just send it
[8640.90 --> 8642.90]  I was like, okay, sure
[8642.90 --> 8644.02]  Interesting
[8644.02 --> 8648.58]  Is there a correct amount of mouth open or uh, this is apparently a mr. Beast thing?
[8649.06 --> 8650.90]  Um, so if you look at like
[8652.02 --> 8655.06]  Let's see here if you look at his stuff lately
[8656.90 --> 8657.30]  Um
[8660.98 --> 8664.10]  Yeah, so like if his mouth is open his teeth are clenched
[8665.46 --> 8668.82]  Like he doesn't have mouth gape. Yeah, interesting no mouth gape
[8670.66 --> 8670.90]  None
[8670.90 --> 8672.90]  Oh
[8673.62 --> 8678.82]  There's a little bit right there little one tiny tiny and there's technically a little one right here
[8678.82 --> 8682.02]  Yeah, okay, but only like very very minor none of the like
[8682.98 --> 8687.62]  That we're used to from back in the day, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, and that's been going on for
[8688.58 --> 8693.62]  Quite a while now. Yeah, and yeah, they released a thing a while ago saying they did they did a bunch of a b testing of like
[8693.62 --> 8697.86]  The exact same thumbnail but just one of them had some mouth gape and one
[8697.86 --> 8701.94]  Yeah, didn't and the one without mouth gape always performed a little bit better interesting. Yeah
[8703.94 --> 8708.82]  How do you know there's differences with different audiences and stuff like I don't know that that's gonna work for
[8709.46 --> 8711.70]  whatever different youtube channel, but
[8712.58 --> 8714.58]  um, yeah
[8714.58 --> 8718.90]  All right, why don't we jump into whatever we're supposed to do. So what's that jimmy showing off those new veneers?
[8719.38 --> 8721.70]  Uh, as far as my understanding goes those are photoshopped
[8721.70 --> 8727.54]  There's some weird I watched a thing on it. There's a weird they they do it in video sometimes too
[8727.94 --> 8732.98]  And he'll like turn it away and it'll like turn off and you can see his normal teeth and then he'll turn back and they like clip back in
[8734.10 --> 8736.10]  odd really odd choice. Yeah
[8737.46 --> 8739.46]  Oh
[8740.26 --> 8744.18]  Really apparently he has it wasn't photoshop. He has new fake teeth. Oh
[8744.18 --> 8752.26]  Crazy don't veneers like ruin your natural teeth though. I have no idea dude. I thought they did
[8752.26 --> 8756.98]  I thought they have to like like shave down part of your teeth in order to apply them or something
[8758.58 --> 8763.06]  That that always seemed like uh, that always seemed like an odd choice to me
[8763.62 --> 8769.94]  And this is even this is even coming from someone who is like done face treatments and you know, whatever, right?
[8769.94 --> 8772.98]  Like i've done uh, morpheus 8 i've done, um
[8774.66 --> 8775.62]  Micro needling
[8775.62 --> 8776.66]  um
[8778.66 --> 8783.46]  Yes, your actual teeth are just little spikes you've got to be kidding me crazy
[8785.30 --> 8790.98]  There covers more than like gluing plastic to the front of them. You have to permanently have them
[8792.50 --> 8793.22]  Shut up
[8794.18 --> 8799.46]  I have heard about regrowing teeth though. They're working on it. I think it's a drug treatment right where they can like stimulate
[8799.70 --> 8801.70]  teeth regrowth or something
[8802.58 --> 8804.58]  Huh?
[8806.26 --> 8810.82]  It's just better protecting the net crowns do the same thing but basically just
[8811.38 --> 8813.14]  artificial protecting the natural part
[8813.94 --> 8820.18]  But can't you have issues where where like the real teeth under it are like impossible to clean and therefore they can
[8820.42 --> 8826.10]  Like decay or something. I don't know. I haven't I haven't looked into um, I haven't looked into veneers a ton
[8826.10 --> 8831.14]  Um, yeah, so they did use ai to edit his teeth for a while
[8832.66 --> 8832.82]  um
[8833.70 --> 8838.26]  But apparently okay, where oh because I had seen I had seen stuff like this before
[8839.30 --> 8841.78]  So you see like here. It's just a flat line
[8843.06 --> 8846.42]  And then he actually has like shape to his teeth right right right right right
[8846.42 --> 8852.34]  I had seen someone make like a an uh, there's a whole video with like a lot more. Oh my god
[8853.38 --> 8858.98]  Detail yeah, I just I I can't imagine caring that much about jimmy's teeth, but sure. Oh, no, I thought it was interesting like
[8859.62 --> 8864.02]  The lengths they would go to and the fact that they went to those lengths, but then off also left
[8865.14 --> 8869.94]  Examples of it like clipping back to real blah blah blah blah blah blah, but yeah, I guess he has veneers now
[8869.94 --> 8876.66]  I don't know dude if I had major dental issues. I think I would just go straight to like solid white gold teeth
[8879.46 --> 8885.78]  Yeah, why do they have to be separate can't they just be like one well, no, no, no individual solid one teeth
[8886.74 --> 8890.50]  I think I would go straight for just the implants. Dan just wants like a
[8891.62 --> 8894.58]  Like uh, like you ever uh, you get the mouth guard blade
[8896.10 --> 8897.94]  Just give me a giant gold blade
[8899.94 --> 8903.14]  Are you carrying the mask look yeah?
[8903.70 --> 8905.70]  There you go
[8907.14 --> 8909.14]  That's an old reference horrifying
[8909.22 --> 8910.26]  Um
[8910.42 --> 8912.42]  What are we on right now?
[8912.90 --> 8914.66]  Okay, the show is brought to you by squarespace

[8966.26 --> 8968.26]  The show is also brought to you by delta hub
[8968.58 --> 8974.02]  It says luke tell the story about the magnificent pizza you and sammy had in berlin
[8974.02 --> 8976.02]  I have no context for this so
[8976.58 --> 8977.38]  The only uh
[8977.38 --> 8980.98]  No, go away stop it. I'm trying to put it on loop cam. Okay. There we go
[8983.62 --> 8990.82]  Oh, wait, what what are your notes for this? Okay, well luke tell the story of the magnificent pizza you had in berlin
[8990.82 --> 8992.58]  I will not what are dan's notes?
[8992.58 --> 8993.54]  I don't know
[8993.54 --> 8995.86]  They never tell me anything. Okay. Well
[8995.86 --> 9001.06]  uh a long time ago the you know, i've been to germany
[9003.22 --> 9006.90]  Either two or three times did was it two separate trips for sennheiser and and uh
[9007.54 --> 9010.10]  Cherry it was one trip so i've been to germany twice then
[9010.58 --> 9015.54]  uh and and one time i did some adventuring with brandon afterwards the last time i was there
[9015.86 --> 9021.86]  And we went to specifically one place that had pizza and only one place that had pizza and we ordered a
[9022.42 --> 9026.58]  Margarita pizza and it was the best pizza i've ever had nice so when i was
[9027.22 --> 9029.22]  Going around doing random stuff with sammy this time
[9029.22 --> 9032.34]  I was telling him all about the pizza and how good it was and i'm saying he should get one
[9032.58 --> 9035.46]  We ordered a margarita pizza and do you have a photo of it?
[9035.94 --> 9037.94]  Is that what you have? No
[9037.94 --> 9039.94]  Then what's what's prepped?
[9039.94 --> 9041.06]  The shot calls
[9042.26 --> 9047.46]  Like regular cam there's no luke cam call in this. Okay, sure now there's no music. Um anyways
[9047.46 --> 9055.30]  Anyways, when i think of margarita pizza this is what i think of which is what comes up when you search margarita pizza
[9055.30 --> 9057.30]  Yeah, that's a margarita pizza
[9058.26 --> 9061.86]  Disappointingly there is no alcoholic slushy beverage
[9063.06 --> 9066.18]  I mean sure it says pizza i mean yeah margarita pizza
[9066.98 --> 9069.14]  I could make an ai image of that lime and tequila
[9069.62 --> 9073.14]  But you see like like this is kind of the quintessential one that i think of sure yep
[9073.14 --> 9078.42]  You have got a couple you can usually see the sauce in there between the mozzarella thing slices
[9078.74 --> 9082.90]  You've got basil like a pretty substantial amount of basil if that leaf cool
[9083.30 --> 9085.94]  We got a pizza that looked a lot more like this
[9086.82 --> 9095.22]  Except just no green at all disappoint. It was just what i would call as a north american a cheese pizza. Yes, that's it
[9096.18 --> 9101.14]  I thought we got pizza scammed because they had a photo that looked almost exactly like this
[9101.14 --> 9105.38]  On the I think that's an ai photo, but they had a photo that looked almost exactly like that
[9105.94 --> 9109.46]  On their menu. We ordered a margarita. Are you going somewhere with this?
[9110.26 --> 9112.82]  No, I don't know why this is part of so you had bad food
[9113.94 --> 9120.10]  Uh, yeah, basically, okay, we then asked flow plane and apparently this is a margarita pizza. Yeah, it is
[9120.50 --> 9122.66]  That sucks. I hate yeah, that's true
[9123.38 --> 9130.66]  Basically just means cheese pizza, but that's ridiculous. The fancier ones are just like nicer cheese pizza. Yeah, that's crazy
[9130.66 --> 9135.54]  Yeah, I've had margarita pizza that is that and I don't order margarita pizza anymore because every time I order it
[9135.54 --> 9138.58]  It is deeply disappointing. So speaking of
[9139.86 --> 9141.86]  That I guess oh
[9143.46 --> 9145.46]  You know what's also disappointing?
[9145.78 --> 9147.78]  wrist pain
[9148.10 --> 9154.10]  Improper wrist support during your nine to five could lead to repetitive strain injuries putting you out of commission
[9154.74 --> 9158.58]  Delta hub's carpio wrist rest aims to address that but with a twist
[9159.06 --> 9161.70]  It can glide with your hand as it moves around your desk
[9162.02 --> 9166.26]  Which is great for transitioning from mouse to keyboard and for gamers who play with lower sensitivity
[9166.74 --> 9168.34]  A bunch of folks here at lmg use them
[9168.34 --> 9173.38]  So it was a natural fit to collaborate and to bring you an exclusive ltt edition of the carpio
[9173.70 --> 9179.70]  Click our link in the description today to pick up one for your mousing hand or a right left bundle for a discounted price
[9180.34 --> 9183.78]  So we were just supposed to talk until someone said the word disappointing
[9185.30 --> 9189.78]  I have no idea. You will answer for this. I don't think it was dan's plan
[9190.42 --> 9197.78]  Regular cam luke tell story about the magnificent pizza. Yeah, and sammy linus cam. You know what's also disappointing wrist pain
[9199.54 --> 9201.86]  So I was video insert number 21
[9202.42 --> 9205.86]  I was supposed to just you got it. You nailed it. I mean, I'm not good
[9205.86 --> 9210.98]  I was trying to get us there and then you just this is also the first time i've seen you so the wide cam
[9211.86 --> 9213.86]  In a in a shot call
[9213.86 --> 9220.74]  True cool. Okay. Anyways, it pisses me off that those are both margarita pizzas. I think that is stupid
[9220.82 --> 9225.22]  Yeah, and I think people need to get their act together and figure that out because that is absurd
[9225.30 --> 9226.74]  You know what else is stupid?
[9226.74 --> 9230.58]  Google's android shenanigans and they've been officially called out
[9230.58 --> 9234.98]  By a graphene os developer on the official graphene os twitter account
[9236.02 --> 9239.86]  For recent moves that make graphene os less secure
[9242.10 --> 9248.90]  It's a strange time to talk about android protecting users android recently changed the security update system in a way
[9248.90 --> 9256.66]  Which massively downgrades security and puts users at risk commercial exploit companies and governments can easily obtain access to broadly distributed partner previews
[9256.66 --> 9260.10]  Adding four month delays for patches is atrocious
[9260.74 --> 9263.70]  Also in june you claimed aosp wasn't going anywhere
[9263.86 --> 9270.34]  You then proceeded to not release the july or august monthly updates to aosp followed by not releasing the september quarterly update
[9270.58 --> 9277.06]  You officially communicated to the media and said aosp releases were continuing followed by three months of not publishing releases to it
[9277.30 --> 9279.62]  Why should people believe what you say about sideloading?
[9279.62 --> 9290.90]  Well said well said graphene os thank you very much for that google get it together, please
[9291.38 --> 9295.54]  Because I actually do want apple to have competition. I think it's good for them
[9297.22 --> 9303.86]  Intel speaking of things that happen when you don't have enough competition they just love 14 nanometer so much
[9303.86 --> 9309.06]  That they launched yet another 14 nanometer chip this week
[9309.54 --> 9316.90]  The source here is tom's hardware who is reporting on intel's new 14 nanometer and I kid you not
[9317.46 --> 9318.98]  plus plus plus
[9319.70 --> 9323.62]  desktop cpu that it turns out is just
[9324.58 --> 9329.38]  A 10th gen cpu from is it four years ago?
[9330.26 --> 9335.94]  The core i5 110 appears as far as anybody can tell to be
[9336.50 --> 9340.18]  Literally a core i5 10 400 from
[9341.54 --> 9343.30]  2020 so sorry excuse me
[9344.02 --> 9350.10]  five years ago here's a comparison page of the two cpus from intel
[9350.74 --> 9354.82]  Directly so we're going to start at the bottom okay just for funsies
[9354.82 --> 9358.82]  VTX with extended page tables yes yes
[9359.38 --> 9361.38]  Virtualization technology for directed io
[9361.94 --> 9362.98]  Yes, yes
[9362.98 --> 9364.98]  Virtualization technology
[9364.98 --> 9365.86]  Yes, yes
[9366.66 --> 9370.82]  Ah intel stable it platform program no oh also no
[9371.38 --> 9376.66]  I'm not going to read all of these so we're just going to go through and see if there's any
[9376.66 --> 9385.38]  Any differences that intel can identify between these two chips any at all intel waiting for it
[9386.34 --> 9387.70]  No, no, yes, yes
[9388.42 --> 9394.98]  Package size identical t-junction identical lga 1200 brother
[9395.78 --> 9397.62]  You are launching a cpu
[9397.62 --> 9402.34]  On a two platforms ago socket
[9402.98 --> 9406.10]  Are you kidding me right now?
[9406.66 --> 9411.54]  And it's not like it's not like when amd launches a new am4 chip and we're like hey
[9412.74 --> 9420.98]  Bro move because there's a lot of am4 you know users out there who are running legitimately like much older chips that might need an upgrade now
[9421.70 --> 9427.94]  This is like you only supported this for a couple real generations and then some like weird
[9428.26 --> 9429.70]  Refreshes some fake ones
[9430.26 --> 9435.30]  So people who have this like already have a 10th gen cpu. This isn't an upgrade to any of that
[9436.50 --> 9439.06]  Okay scalability 1s only
[9439.70 --> 9440.58]  1s
[9440.58 --> 9441.78]  That means the same thing
[9442.42 --> 9445.30]  Yeah, so far as as far as I can tell the differences are actually
[9446.34 --> 9449.70]  Written different the device id is the same
[9450.58 --> 9452.98]  Do we need to keep going? Let's keep going?
[9453.70 --> 9456.98]  quick sync open gl support oh lordy
[9457.78 --> 9461.78]  Uh, yeah, that's all the same. That's all the same. Oh
[9463.38 --> 9465.38]  1.10
[9465.62 --> 9467.78]  Versus 1.1 gigahertz
[9471.14 --> 9472.50]  Data entry is really fun
[9473.62 --> 9474.82]  It's ddr4
[9474.82 --> 9478.90]  They're launching a ddr4 cpu today
[9480.90 --> 9484.74]  What why why call it a new cpu?
[9485.70 --> 9489.70]  Literally the only difference is the launch date
[9493.62 --> 9494.74]  These are all just zeros
[9494.74 --> 9498.66]  And the name
[9500.82 --> 9502.02]  You didn't even
[9502.02 --> 9502.26]  You didn't even
[9502.26 --> 9502.82]  f***ing
[9502.82 --> 9504.26]  discount it
[9506.02 --> 9510.82]  Now to be clear the fact that they are the same price on arc or sorry uh
[9511.38 --> 9516.74]  intel.com slash content which used to be called arc and used to have a cool brand and was way cooler
[9516.74 --> 9517.78]  um
[9518.66 --> 9524.98]  Just because it says 200 on arc does not mean that intel expects anybody to pay 200 for these what is
[9524.98 --> 9526.26]  realistically
[9526.26 --> 9532.18]  Probably happening is these are for developing markets where there's still a good volume of like old
[9532.66 --> 9538.26]  socket old chipset motherboards and they can kind of dump them into markets that are
[9538.26 --> 9544.58]  uh, for example, that have extremely high uh taxes in the form of tariffs on imports for instance
[9545.54 --> 9545.86]  um
[9546.82 --> 9554.10]  And so it's just at a high price to make sure that nobody outside of those markets is going to be caring about this and clamoring for them
[9554.66 --> 9555.14]  but like
[9556.34 --> 9558.02]  Can we just?
[9558.02 --> 9563.78]  Stop with the deceptive branding. This is not a new product. It doesn't need a new name
[9564.50 --> 9566.26]  Just sell cheap
[9567.30 --> 9568.10]  10 400s
[9568.98 --> 9569.70]  I I don't
[9570.58 --> 9571.54]  I don't
[9571.54 --> 9572.58]  I don't get it
[9573.78 --> 9576.34]  Yeah, I don't understand. I do get it. I just hate it
[9576.90 --> 9581.30]  What is it then? What does the product launch help with the product launch helps make it look new?
[9582.10 --> 9583.38]  To people who don't know
[9584.18 --> 9586.18]  And to people who won't do this comparison
[9586.50 --> 9590.18]  So someone who like think about the way that okay, i'm gonna have to come up with an example
[9590.18 --> 9593.46]  I was gonna say blender, but you would research the crap out of a blender. So, um
[9594.74 --> 9598.74]  Think about the way that you would buy finding an example. Don't buy anything
[9599.46 --> 9601.46]  If I do I research the crap out of it
[9601.78 --> 9604.66]  Think about the way that emma would buy a knife
[9605.30 --> 9605.62]  okay
[9606.50 --> 9608.18]  she would go to a store
[9609.22 --> 9609.54]  and
[9610.74 --> 9612.74]  There would be some knives
[9612.74 --> 9616.82]  And if one of them was the same knife from five years ago, but with like
[9617.62 --> 9622.18]  But it was you know, we had a new handle on it that made it look like the knife from this year
[9622.18 --> 9626.66]  Which realistically if it's a knife that's called the 2025 edition that might actually be the only change
[9627.22 --> 9628.90]  Like that's the new one
[9628.90 --> 9633.30]  And so to the person who's going in and not like an enthusiast for knives or
[9634.18 --> 9635.86]  You know, whatever
[9635.86 --> 9638.98]  They just go into a store and this is a this is core ultra
[9638.98 --> 9641.54]  I love how you brand you picked a category that we have like
[9642.18 --> 9644.58]  Solid ones and because I looked it up
[9644.58 --> 9649.22]  Yeah, well like look
[9649.86 --> 9655.46]  The point is that most people don't care about the things that don't really impact them that much
[9655.46 --> 9658.58]  I suspect you wouldn't I suspect you wouldn't research a water bottle very much
[9659.14 --> 9663.46]  No, I think that you would just buy a water bottle and you'd be like four ltt ones
[9663.46 --> 9670.18]  I just had an algae in ones. Yeah, it would just be kind of whatever that is fair. Um, and so there are there are absolutely
[9670.98 --> 9674.50]  Categories that we're not enthusiasts for and that's who they're targeting with this
[9674.50 --> 9678.26]  I mean, it's not like a it's not like a cutting edge top-of-the-line gaming processor
[9678.26 --> 9680.18]  It's like a it's a six core 10th gen, right?
[9680.66 --> 9684.82]  So which it to be clear is actually still going to provide a pretty decently
[9685.70 --> 9689.78]  Good gaming experience if it's paired with a with a like an appropriate gpu
[9689.78 --> 9691.14]  It's it's a it's a good chip
[9691.62 --> 9697.06]  And so my problem is not that they're selling it. My problem is just like why do we have to have this deceptive branding?
[9697.06 --> 9699.70]  I hate it. Just tell me what it is
[9702.58 --> 9705.62]  That is my end of my ted talk
[9706.50 --> 9707.62]  ebay
[9707.62 --> 9711.22]  restricts items over 500 from shipping to the us
[9712.10 --> 9718.58]  on august 27th ebay started enforcing an update to its seller listing policy for sales to the united states
[9719.14 --> 9724.10]  to limit the sale of items from certain countries to 500 including shipping
[9724.66 --> 9729.78]  according to the policy page on ebay there had previously been restrictions in place but for items up to
[9730.66 --> 9732.10]  2500 in value
[9732.74 --> 9738.58]  the list of restricted countries is available on the ebay source link here and ebay states that the policy is to
[9738.58 --> 9745.70]  ensure a good shopping experience for us buyers and maintain high quality shipping performance
[9745.70 --> 9751.62]  i've actually seen quite a few americans um upset about shipping times
[9752.10 --> 9752.82]  for uh
[9752.82 --> 9759.14]  i saw i saw one uh that was about dbrand which we are our sponsor team is looking into but what i will say is
[9759.14 --> 9759.78]  probably
[9759.78 --> 9761.30]  it is
[9761.86 --> 9767.86]  it has been very challenging to get shipping to get shipments into the us in a timely
[9767.86 --> 9772.74]  and cost-effective manner with all of the tariff will they won't they will they won't they yes they
[9772.74 --> 9774.50]  will but not like this um
[9775.70 --> 9781.86]  see-sawing that has been going on uh so this is this is this is a practical impact this is interesting
[9781.86 --> 9786.66]  because i i looked up the list that they linked yeah like canada's not on here
[9786.66 --> 9791.14]  why portugal but not spain germany's not on here switzerland's not on here
[9792.66 --> 9792.90]  uh
[9795.46 --> 9796.18]  no france
[9797.22 --> 9801.14]  la france but french polynesia is yeah and french guinea
[9801.78 --> 9805.54]  guiana i don't know singapore is that's kind of surprising to me
[9806.74 --> 9808.74]  i don't know man is taiwan on here
[9808.74 --> 9813.94]  nope are you saying taiwan is a country yeah
[9815.38 --> 9816.98]  based hell yeah
[9818.82 --> 9820.34]  based as hell yeah
[9821.22 --> 9826.74]  i just is china on here um oh i don't know no
[9829.38 --> 9836.66]  what's the decision making here i don't know i just am saying yeah this is this is what this is
[9836.66 --> 9842.74]  what happens when things are confusing things get confusing hey though nintendo got another video
[9842.74 --> 9850.42]  game patent yay i know you were excited to talk about this it's interesting i don't obviously like
[9850.42 --> 9855.46]  it but i think it's something to be aware of and it's interesting nintendo has been granted a patent
[9855.46 --> 9860.42]  that covers the ability to summon another character and make them battle on your behalf
[9860.42 --> 9868.02]  which by itself is like oh god uh it then goes on to describe things in more detail
[9868.02 --> 9873.14]  um a console or other system is being used to run a video game from storage
[9873.86 --> 9880.18]  that was kind of weird just off the hop i thought that was weird because why wouldn't a game cart
[9880.18 --> 9885.70]  count maybe that counts as a form of storage i don't know um the player controls anything is
[9885.70 --> 9891.70]  storage yeah exactly so it's playing a game a cd is storage a floppy disk is storage ram is a form
[9891.70 --> 9895.70]  of storage i mean i wouldn't call it storage it technically is though
[9898.26 --> 9911.30]  if i had in my house a cremation you know oven yeah right would you call it storage i mean in that case
[9911.30 --> 9917.78]  if if every time the power goes out it stores the fire goes on dust like i don't think your fireplace
[9917.78 --> 9924.34]  is storage i'm sorry i'm sorry i disagree with you so if you loaded a game into ram you could avoid
[9924.34 --> 9930.98]  their patent um sure i that's my interpretation not a lawyer go ahead i don't think it is i think
[9930.98 --> 9935.62]  it is storage but anyways um a console or other system is being used to run a game from storage uh
[9935.62 --> 9941.94]  the player controls a character in a virtual space uh the player can perform an input command
[9941.94 --> 9948.74]  to make a sub character appear i.e summon another character if there's an enemy where the sub character
[9948.74 --> 9954.90]  appears the player can control a battle between the sub character and the enemy and if there's no enemy
[9954.90 --> 9960.34]  where the sub character appears the sub character will automatically move around okay isn't this just a
[9960.34 --> 9967.86]  familiar is nintendo do they did they they got this patent the player yeah the player can move the
[9967.86 --> 9972.74]  sub character to a different location on the field and if an enemy is there they can control the battle
[9972.74 --> 9978.82]  between the sub character and the enemy i think one of the minor differences is that uh the battle
[9978.82 --> 9987.14]  wouldn't be between like you and your thing it's just a battle between the thing that you're controlling
[9987.14 --> 9991.78]  and one enemy in this case you're not involved other than commands
[9995.86 --> 10002.10]  because i i thought like basically any video game warlock like think diablo not warlock i guess
[10002.10 --> 10009.54]  diablo necromancer you're summoning a thing it can go out and fight things but it doesn't perfectly
[10009.54 --> 10016.82]  follow this because it's not like one summon because in diablo usually it's multiple and they just kind
[10016.82 --> 10022.18]  of hover around you you don't like send them out and it doesn't create like one-on-one battles they
[10022.18 --> 10027.86]  just all fight right so it's like it doesn't it doesn't perfect the like necro example doesn't
[10027.86 --> 10036.26]  perfectly fit um this thing i don't think um the the the reason this could be scarier than a
[10036.26 --> 10041.86]  traditional trademark is in the case of ip law nintendo is required to fight and protect protect
[10041.86 --> 10046.42]  itself with a trademark or else they could lose it patents are not like that meaning nintendo
[10046.42 --> 10052.66]  technically has to pick and choose privileges on which infringement they want to pursue which gives
[10052.66 --> 10058.10]  them even more power they can they can let people that they like get away with things and they can go
[10058.10 --> 10063.30]  after others and that won't make them lose this patent um discussion question is there a universe
[10063.30 --> 10066.98]  out there where a patent on a video game mechanic like this could be good for the consumer and
[10066.98 --> 10075.14]  i can't imagine one although it is getting really weird with basically every popular game getting
[10075.14 --> 10076.98]  immediately ripped off by roblox
[10079.62 --> 10084.10]  so i'm not sure how that works uh someone in float plane chat said apparently a part of the
[10084.10 --> 10090.18]  patent is that the thing has to be stored in a sphere so basically they're trying to patent pokemon
[10090.18 --> 10103.06]  battles essentially um ah man could nintendo just like nintendo has no problem being the beneficiary
[10103.62 --> 10109.78]  of innovative gameplay mechanics i don't believe that mario kart was the first racing game for instance um
[10112.50 --> 10116.66]  i mean they're they're like sports titles were definitely not the first sports titles but when
[10116.66 --> 10120.90]  they're on the other side of the equation they behave like petulant children
[10123.22 --> 10129.06]  i um yeah i don't think there's really any good justification for this adam added to this okay
[10129.06 --> 10136.74]  hear me out could we create a system where large corpo plaintiffs are allowed to sue but they have to
[10136.74 --> 10140.82]  cover the legal cost of the defendant uh until the decision is made
[10140.82 --> 10150.34]  that would actually be kind of a cool way to disincentivize like bullcrap lawsuits it's very
[10150.34 --> 10152.10]  interesting um
[10156.50 --> 10160.42]  could be extended to dmca takedowns if universal wants to sue you they can
[10160.42 --> 10165.54]  but they have to pay your court fees while you defend yourself that would be kind of wild i think
[10165.54 --> 10173.06]  it's really interesting i think there's some concerns um of like until they win if they win
[10173.06 --> 10177.30]  then you're responsible for whatever the judgment is i still i feel i kind of like this i think it's
[10177.30 --> 10182.26]  worth doing i do think there's some concerns like i think people might get a false sense of security
[10183.14 --> 10187.62]  i think like i'm obviously gonna win this and then they have infinite money on their end and they just
[10187.62 --> 10191.78]  win through money which is like well i think i think you could set it up so that you have to provide
[10191.78 --> 10198.98]  the same funding to both sides so if you if you basically you have to so you have to in escrow or
[10198.98 --> 10203.22]  whatever you have to like you have to or not in escrow because then the the defendant wouldn't actually
[10203.22 --> 10210.82]  have it but whatever you spend pursuing pursuing it oh i think it would have to apply to like individuals
[10210.82 --> 10216.18]  that's also cool and interesting yeah but it comes with its own pitfalls in my mind because again
[10216.18 --> 10220.34]  false sense of security if you think you're gonna win this could ruin you for your entire life
[10220.34 --> 10224.02]  but remember this is a slap on the wrist for the game company but you'll have a super cool
[10224.02 --> 10225.94]  team of lawyers to tell you you're not going to win
[10228.02 --> 10231.70]  and then you'll still lose some money and then you'll settle much i guess yeah so you'll have to
[10231.70 --> 10236.34]  reach some kind of settlement the point is just that you wouldn't be able to intimidate people i
[10236.34 --> 10239.78]  think it's cool in general you wouldn't be able to just there's definitely an idea here that i think
[10239.78 --> 10246.90]  we should do as if we could do anything yeah when we're in when we're in charge of canada then we will uh
[10246.90 --> 10251.06]  we'll be sure to implement we're running marathons something like that running marathons yeah actually
[10251.06 --> 10256.42]  kind of cool uh carney carney ran a marathon oh did he got a pretty good time apparently oh okay man
[10256.42 --> 10262.50]  good for him i didn't actually look into it because i don't care i saw i mean that's neat i saw that
[10262.50 --> 10270.50]  there's talk of as part of the rift with our southern neighbors and attempts to um mend fences with our
[10270.50 --> 10276.58]  far eastern neighbors perhaps getting rid of the 100 tariffs on chinese evs
[10278.82 --> 10286.42]  i've heard very rumor mill things about this it's very interesting prime minister carney if you're
[10286.42 --> 10295.86]  watching um i have a humble request uh if you're going to do this i want a commitment from the chinese
[10295.86 --> 10300.90]  ev manufacturers that they are going to replace the manufacturing jobs that we are going to be
[10300.90 --> 10310.34]  losing especially in ontario um with their own sort of their own manufacturing within our borders that
[10310.34 --> 10314.98]  will at some point probably end up serving other parts of north america as well i think that's one
[10314.98 --> 10320.26]  concession i also think that we should be getting strong investment from those companies in renewable
[10320.26 --> 10327.38]  energy here to support the ev charging um that we're going to need to do a lot more of because
[10327.38 --> 10337.46]  we're going to have like 11 000 evs um that is my that is my two cents on the matter i also think that
[10337.46 --> 10346.02]  we need to carefully consider our strategic uh minerals and not give up too much of that as part of this
[10346.02 --> 10351.14]  whole process because i suspect that would be part of well look i have no problem with the chinese
[10351.14 --> 10358.66]  mining the minerals if they're also manufacturing the batteries and evs within canada they can i just
[10358.66 --> 10363.94]  don't think that's going to go they can capitalistically benefit from that from that harvesting by selling
[10363.94 --> 10368.42]  within our market they can have access to the market okay i mean i don't think i'm going to get my
[10368.42 --> 10373.14]  deal because we also need like canola farmers to be able to export to china and stuff there's a whole
[10373.14 --> 10379.22]  thing there but um i i want some automotive manufacturing on the continent you can't just like
[10380.26 --> 10385.38]  wage we are the only ones who can manufacture cars anymore warfare i don't think that's cool
[10386.34 --> 10390.10]  yeah i think that's exactly what they want to do though well that is exactly what they want to do yeah
[10390.10 --> 10395.38]  yeah how would you tackle the jobs thing because this is this is a song that has been
[10395.38 --> 10400.10]  saying many a time where a company's like yeah yeah we're gonna we're gonna get a ton of jobs here
[10400.10 --> 10406.02]  we're gonna build this like massive factory and then it's 90 automated and there's 10 jobs um so
[10406.02 --> 10415.38]  do you do you do like it has to be x amount of jobs that are in you know some certain level of average
[10415.38 --> 10420.34]  income versus the country's i don't know how you tackle that ever i don't know i mean it obviously
[10420.34 --> 10424.18]  needs some consideration because i don't really care if they're manufacturing jobs they could be service
[10424.18 --> 10430.18]  jobs they could be whatever doesn't matter as long as there are as long as there is a a net positive
[10430.18 --> 10437.38]  workforce uh benefit to having this work being done here i think i actually do care you care about
[10437.38 --> 10443.22]  specifically manufacturing because remember that automated equipment is on our soil now i care in
[10443.22 --> 10448.18]  the sense that it should be defined i don't necessarily care that it needs to be manufacturing sure
[10448.18 --> 10453.94]  uh because the the reason why i'm saying i do care is because you you just had service jobs and if
[10453.94 --> 10457.78]  they end up just like opening a bunch of restaurants and then just like no not service
[10457.78 --> 10463.94]  i okay sure i see what you mean so i meant service like in the it like just like with scrapyard
[10463.94 --> 10468.82]  wars they're gonna try to work around yeah if there's anyone who would out scrapyard wars us it
[10468.82 --> 10475.70]  would be the ccp yeah um fanboy nz says hot take linus canada car makers should compete
[10475.70 --> 10486.98]  which ones beaumont our automa our domestic automotive industry was gutted decades ago by the americans so
[10487.70 --> 10493.70]  we're basically just trading one for another at this point make bombardier make cars
[10495.46 --> 10503.78]  you mean bombardier bombardier bombardier i want a bombardier car dude wtf is a beaumont uh
[10505.70 --> 10514.98]  beaumont um canadian car manufacturer here you go here you go beaumont automobile
[10515.94 --> 10525.62]  this is a 1968 beaumont sd 396. dude they're kind of sick not gonna lie pretty cool looks a lot like a gto
[10525.62 --> 10535.86]  um mid-size automobiles oh it was just oh it was a make made by general motors of canada so even then
[10535.86 --> 10541.22]  it was like uh it was based on the chevelle it was barely even canadian dude a bombardier car would go
[10541.22 --> 10548.10]  sick good go really hard though yeah over the snow yeah yeah yeah they make planes a lot of companies
[10548.10 --> 10556.26]  that made planes it went into cars they actually make the sickest plane right now the global 8 000 is
[10556.26 --> 10556.50]  like
[10561.14 --> 10564.10]  i'm just saying the bmw logo is a propeller
[10566.42 --> 10572.10]  there are lots of car companies that made planes look at this thing proud canadian here boys
[10572.10 --> 10580.74]  it is the fastest business jet in the world it has a range of 8 000 nautical miles
[10582.10 --> 10590.02]  this thing can go almost 15 000 kilometers on a single fill-up and it travels at mach 0.94
[10590.98 --> 10595.06]  wow it's i think it's the fastest plane since the concord
[10595.06 --> 10603.38]  uh don't they have that um well that carries passengers okay yeah because i thought they had
[10603.38 --> 10608.82]  like a fighter jet or whatever no no no no i thought they had like a new new new concord thing going on
[10608.82 --> 10613.94]  i think there's something in development from um what's what's their nuts uh boeing or something but
[10613.94 --> 10616.02]  lord only knows if that'll ever be finished uh
[10618.66 --> 10624.10]  seven of lesbians ask does bombardier even exist anymore i thought they were gutted by private equity
[10624.10 --> 10630.26]  i don't know they seem to be doing okay shows you what i know if if that's true but no that's not
[10630.26 --> 10634.10]  my understanding i thought bombarty is kind of doing stuff at this point the airplane is missing
[10634.10 --> 10639.06]  fo regardless my point was that a lot of companies that make cars used to make airplanes and that's
[10639.06 --> 10647.78]  true i don't really care too much about the logo um anyway yeah global 8 000 looks sick could literally
[10647.78 --> 10654.50]  never afford one uh at zim and floatplane chat says 78 million dollar price tag
[10658.82 --> 10663.94]  hold on where do they have any interior shots i mean the interior is basically gonna look how big
[10663.94 --> 10671.30]  the windows are my like what are you kidding me i'm the the healthiest of cabins look at this
[10671.30 --> 10675.62]  oh my look at this god
[10679.38 --> 10685.14]  i guess i'll just sleep in my like i don't know that's at least a full right is that a full-size bed
[10685.14 --> 10688.98]  yeah it looks like a full to me and here's the cuck chair built right in
[10688.98 --> 10696.82]  rough well sorry what's rough being
[10699.14 --> 10706.02]  not the fabric on the cuck chair yeah no definitely not yeah uh okay anywho what are we supposed to be
[10706.02 --> 10716.98]  talking about oh yes okay okay um okay i just liked this because it's what owen um
[10718.42 --> 10725.78]  uncle owen and aunt beru did in star wars oh yeah this is it's a it's a moisture evaporator
[10725.78 --> 10730.58]  what what are what are they called in star wars are they called moisture evaporators or i thought
[10730.58 --> 10735.94]  they had like a few different contraptions i don't know but basically moisture evaporator
[10735.94 --> 10739.78]  well yeah that doesn't make any sense what are they called oh just moisture farmer no no i think
[10739.78 --> 10744.10]  the thing's called something he's he's he's not talking about the the moisture evaporators yeah
[10744.10 --> 10749.54]  moisture vaporate wait that doesn't make sense either okay well vaporators yeah that doesn't make
[10749.54 --> 10754.26]  sense because that would turn it to vapor seems weird moisture evaporators is right it says pancreas
[10754.26 --> 10759.62]  i trust pancreas moisture evaporators um i i mean it's star wars technology it doesn't matter the
[10759.62 --> 10764.34]  point is now there's star wars technology and that was all i really had to say about that yeah
[10764.34 --> 10769.38]  um i just saw this thing and i was like oh my god it's star wars uh mit is testing a new
[10769.38 --> 10773.94]  technology to pull water from the air the idea is not new but the hydrogel technology they're using
[10773.94 --> 10779.94]  is it's a window-sized panel made of absorbent hydrogel infused with salt folded up and closed in glass
[10779.94 --> 10785.94]  the material absorbs water vapor from the air and swells then it shrinks as it evaporates the water
[10785.94 --> 10791.78]  condenses on the glass and flows down a tube currently it makes about two-thirds of a cup of water a day
[10791.78 --> 10798.18]  but requires zero power the hope is that these could be scaled up and improved to provide drinking
[10798.18 --> 10803.78]  water for a single household could be great for emergency situations and the discussion question
[10803.78 --> 10811.22]  is how much moisture was uncle owen farming i don't know uh presumably quite a bit because he had like
[10811.22 --> 10818.26]  like like hectares of these moisture evaporators right so star wars i think they kind of brush over it but i
[10818.26 --> 10826.26]  i don't think tatooine have lakes i don't think any at all so i think all of the water for that
[10826.26 --> 10831.22]  entire planet was from these moisture farms yeah so it must have been like an incredible amount yeah
[10831.22 --> 10839.62]  yeah why did anybody settle there it's crazy right uh mexico is taxing video games i mean you can say
[10839.62 --> 10845.30]  that about places in the world now in real life well yeah but in the world now in real life they were like
[10845.30 --> 10850.90]  always there but like tatooine is like space travel like i understand why the tuscans are there i don't
[10850.90 --> 10857.54]  understand why humans bothered it's like do you really have to imperial like conquer and occupy
[10857.54 --> 10858.18]  everything
[10862.26 --> 10870.02]  mexico has published their 2026 economic package and under the healthy taxes section yeah there is a mention of an
[10870.02 --> 10876.82]  eight percent special tax on digital services offering violent video games here's their reason
[10877.70 --> 10883.54]  recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of
[10883.54 --> 10890.26]  aggression among adolescents as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and
[10890.26 --> 10896.98]  anxiety referring to the study the effect of video games on social psychological and physiological
[10896.98 --> 10902.34]  variables in children and adolescents there we go the article itself as some people have pointed out
[10902.34 --> 10907.46]  is actually a well-written study the problem is it's from 2012 and has outdated information such as
[10907.46 --> 10912.82]  references to myspace others pointed out that the economic package also cherry picks certain words
[10912.82 --> 10922.66]  and cases from the study to justify the tax even further um our discussion question is while the narrative of
[10922.66 --> 10928.18]  video games cause violence continues to parade through politics and often has studies disproving it
[10928.98 --> 10934.74]  even if it were true is an eight percent tax the correct solution if they were trying to somehow
[10934.74 --> 10937.70]  mitigate the supposed damage that these video games are doing
[10940.18 --> 10944.02]  no so the very fact that their solution is to tax it by eight percent
[10945.46 --> 10952.58]  be lies that they obviously don't actually consider this to be a problem that they need to solve because
[10952.58 --> 10959.62]  if they did they would have a real solution not just a silly little tax so basically yeah it's a steam tax
[10961.38 --> 10967.62]  which you know our moisture evaporator moisture evaporators are only getting two-thirds of a cup a day
[10967.62 --> 10969.06]  we can't pay a steam tax
[10974.10 --> 10980.10]  i love that you tripped over the name because it's like actually so bad of a name yeah oh well um
[10980.10 --> 10989.30]  i don't have a lot to say to that other than yikes um sure google admits the open web is in rapid
[10989.30 --> 10997.70]  decline google's lawyers in a september 5th court ruling court filing said the fact is that today the
[10997.70 --> 11005.22]  open web is already in rapid decline uh they were arguing that the plaintiffs divestiture proposal would
[11005.22 --> 11010.18]  only accelerate that decline harming publishers who currently rely on open web display advertising
[11010.18 --> 11018.58]  revenue uh notable change from may comments by google vp of search nick fox um saying in quotes from our
[11018.58 --> 11026.18]  point of view the web is thriving uh but there's good news a co-creator of rss oh yeah this is actually
[11026.18 --> 11034.90]  really really interesting um a co-creator of rss eckert walter helped launch rsl or really simple
[11034.90 --> 11042.26]  licensing a free and open standard that ours technica calls beefed up robots.txt instructions
[11042.26 --> 11049.46]  uh which is a solution to ai discriminating click decimating decimating click-throughs or uh pay per crawl
[11049.46 --> 11056.82]  hmm the discussion question is will lom's pay up against rsl i mean no i mean they've stolen
[11056.82 --> 11061.54]  everything up until now so what are we do we really think there's any hope that this will fix anything
[11062.50 --> 11071.78]  um i think that it will help lay legal framework for fighting i think that's really the only chance i
[11071.78 --> 11077.94]  don't think it's actually going to stop anything from happening um but it should put some ammunition on
[11077.94 --> 11087.14]  the side of people that are upset about it um we've got a couple more today warner brothers is an
[11087.14 --> 11096.34]  unlikely ally in the fight against ai slop and has sued mid-journey on thursday warner bros discovery
[11096.34 --> 11103.46]  filed a lawsuit against ai company mid-journey for purposefully infringing copyrighted work to the tune
[11103.46 --> 11112.10]  of either 150 000 per infringed work which could add up to hundreds of millions or all profits that
[11112.10 --> 11118.90]  mid-journey has made related to wb properties in the 101 page suit warner brothers lawyers write
[11119.54 --> 11125.46]  evidently mid-journey will not stop stealing property until a court orders it to stop mid-journey's large
[11125.46 --> 11132.18]  scale infringement is systematic ongoing and willful and warner bros discovery has been and continues to be
[11132.18 --> 11140.66]  substantially and irreparably harmed by it uh there's actually some really good examples uh let me
[11140.66 --> 11147.46]  check if the polygon yeah this is amazing uh so this is uh this is from polygon here dan do you mind
[11147.46 --> 11154.50]  linking to the article if people want to check out more of the examples but this is um pretty incriminating
[11154.50 --> 11166.02]  not yeah only did mid-journey clearly output know what superman looks like but like specifically
[11167.62 --> 11174.98]  specifically exactly what warner bros copyrighted character and now look we can have an awful it's
[11174.98 --> 11180.26]  about you we can have an awful i don't think that was mid-journey uh we can have an awful long
[11180.26 --> 11185.14]  conversation about whether warner brothers fairly compensated the creators of various dc
[11185.62 --> 11189.94]  characters and properties and all of that we could we that's a longer conversation
[11191.62 --> 11193.86]  but what i will say is
[11196.50 --> 11204.82]  mid-journey looks pretty um pretty guilty here and in the current legal framework that is warner brothers ip
[11204.82 --> 11215.62]  um this seems like a pretty pretty big yikes we just have to find out again as all of this makes its
[11215.62 --> 11223.30]  way through the legal system are there going to be any consequences and will those consequences be
[11223.30 --> 11229.94]  lasting because the way that i see it now that all of this is kind of out there um there's no way to put
[11229.94 --> 11236.82]  you know pandora back in her box yeah it's out of the box so you know what what happens then does
[11236.82 --> 11244.10]  mid-journey go bankrupt but then a bunch of people who have been paying themselves out of mid-journey's
[11244.10 --> 11249.62]  investment funds and now have their own personal hoards of wealth just start another one and then
[11249.62 --> 11254.90]  use what well mid-journey stole that i mean it's just out there now honestly likely finding the same
[11254.90 --> 11263.46]  investors again yeah in a lot of cases same key investors at least yeah yeah um osiris asks are
[11263.46 --> 11268.82]  you going to be seeing super mario galaxy in theaters um honestly i'd rather watch it at home is that the
[11268.82 --> 11276.98]  name of the sequel i'm amazed they went straight to the galaxy okay cool yeah i'd rather watch it at home
[11276.98 --> 11286.74]  dude i got a new tv it happens so often no it doesn't even happen that often i had the tcl for
[11286.74 --> 11293.70]  two years oh wow almost two years it felt a lot shorter than yeah dude is that much better
[11297.14 --> 11303.46]  it doesn't have as many backlight zones by a lot which for a tv that size is a bit of a challenge can
[11303.46 --> 11315.30]  you notice it um yes but it has an rgb backlight rgb gamer okay but it actually has benefits for image
[11315.30 --> 11321.54]  quality because instead of shining white through an lcd you're shining color so the color volume that
[11321.54 --> 11324.98]  it can achieve and the reason i thought of it is because super mario bros is a movie that looks
[11326.18 --> 11333.06]  amazing on it also it uses a standard vesa uh bolt pattern so i can actually put it on like a standard
[11333.06 --> 11341.30]  wall mount and i can bring it a little closer so my 116 inch tv can be closer to the actual viewing
[11341.30 --> 11346.50]  size of the 120 inch projector that i used to have mounted right to the wall so dude
[11348.58 --> 11356.90]  uh yeah i i would actually seriously rather watch it at home um sweet heck yeah oh unique username says
[11356.90 --> 11361.06]  you've already talked about it okay well it's actually installed now we installed it or not installed we
[11361.06 --> 11366.26]  opened it on monday i haven't installed it yet so the video of us like opening it and trying it is
[11366.26 --> 11372.26]  in the works and then uh we're actually gonna throw the full gamut of labs testing at it and do like
[11372.26 --> 11376.34]  an installation vlog and that'll be like a second video because it's really expensive okay so i'm not
[11376.34 --> 11380.98]  going to play it because even though it's a trailer we get copyright strikes for trailers all the time
[11380.98 --> 11387.30]  okay that looks like it's what it's called 13 hours ago from ign it's probably real oh yeah cool
[11387.30 --> 11393.38]  official title announcement nintendo direct the super mario galaxy movie
[11394.90 --> 11399.54]  kind of surprised by the title just like you said a long time ago in a super mario galaxy far far away
[11400.58 --> 11405.54]  lossless streaming on spotify is coming no but for real this time uh it'll be rolling out to more
[11405.54 --> 11410.90]  than 50 markets through october with some already starting to get access now the service is going to be
[11410.90 --> 11415.94]  included for premium subscribers it won't be a new subscription tier and it's been a long time
[11415.94 --> 11422.34]  coming with rumors starting as early as 2017 coming later this year um oh oh coming later this year
[11422.34 --> 11430.50]  in 2021 and almost ready in may of 2024 discussion question do you care uh yeah a little bit and it
[11430.50 --> 11438.34]  just feels like being on whatever it's even called now youtube music is just a more and more sad experience
[11438.34 --> 11443.86]  over time really well it used to be google play oh yeah google play was way better and it was actually
[11443.86 --> 11450.42]  like a way better app yeah and then they just made it way worse and then i don't think
[11452.74 --> 11457.78]  i can't name anything that improved about it since they made the change uh i can name a couple what's
[11457.78 --> 11466.90]  improved uh it's way easier to access music videos no sorry since after the change happened what has
[11466.90 --> 11473.78]  improved like okay we have youtube music now yeah we're on here now it's good cool whatever youtube
[11473.78 --> 11479.86]  music is it's better for watching music videos if you care about that no i know oh after we got to
[11479.86 --> 11484.74]  the so we got to platform cool we are here it's better for finding music videos what has now happened
[11484.74 --> 11494.26]  because it's been years uh i can't think of a new feature that came out the only thing i can think of
[11494.26 --> 11499.94]  is they do recaps now which they just stole from spotify and i don't care about yeah i skipped them
[11499.94 --> 11508.42]  yeah um what needs to improve uh the the user experience of youtube music is just worse in a
[11508.42 --> 11516.58]  lot of ways bury the hatchet with sonos so i can just cast to my sonos speakers please the google play
[11516.58 --> 11523.14]  sonos experience was or google play music oh it was so good i would just i would be listening to my
[11523.14 --> 11528.82]  headphones as i walked in the door and then i would just have my youtube or my google play music
[11528.82 --> 11534.02]  app open and i would just click cast and then select the speaker and it would just cast and i
[11534.02 --> 11539.38]  like it wouldn't even practically skip a beat it was amazing i wish if considering they killed the
[11539.38 --> 11544.58]  podcast app if they made podcasts within youtube music better i know they're there but if they made
[11544.58 --> 11549.14]  it better that would be nice sorry handyman i don't think the experience of podcast stuff within
[11549.14 --> 11554.82]  youtube music is all that fantastic um as for lossless formats honestly i mean i don't know i
[11554.82 --> 11560.10]  don't know if i really care i i'm pancratts posted in here i'm just waiting to see the videos about how
[11560.10 --> 11566.58]  people can definitely hear the difference on their like bluetooth earbuds yeah yeah me too i i think there's
[11566.58 --> 11575.14]  a lot of um it takes a really really really fine setup where even like the trained ear can like really
[11575.14 --> 11581.06]  tell the difference between lossless and a pretty decently high quality stream so for me i think
[11581.06 --> 11586.58]  having lossless just generally if i know it's real communicates to me that i'm not getting cheaped out
[11586.58 --> 11591.22]  on an audio quality but the thing is that it's not oh i guess yeah not cheaped out on in terms of like
[11591.22 --> 11596.90]  the cost of delivery but like not the lossless master might not even necessarily be the best one that's
[11596.90 --> 11603.54]  fair so good luck everyone i mean i've seen a lot of cases it probably is but i don't think i have a
[11603.54 --> 11614.82]  particularly fantastic ear but yeah yeah i don't know that's a good point about the master not being
[11615.22 --> 11624.58]  necessarily better um flush door handles on evs can fail so china is now banning them uh whoops i
[11624.58 --> 11629.30]  just moved a thing with modern evs and cars the style has trended towards flush and sleek door handle
[11629.30 --> 11633.22]  designs the problem is that in the event of a power loss these handles can prevent people from
[11633.22 --> 11637.94]  accessing the car the main concern comes from emergency situations like first responders not
[11637.94 --> 11643.38]  being able to assist easily china is apparently looking at banning these style handles by 2027 for
[11643.38 --> 11649.46]  these reasons and our discussion question here is what is your favorite breakfast cereal i thought the
[11649.46 --> 11654.58]  handle thing is interesting because some of them you can kind of press in one side and it pops the
[11654.58 --> 11659.54]  handle out yeah but it's still powered so it requires power to do that because there's an
[11659.54 --> 11664.98]  assumption with evs that they are always powered because they don't just run off of like a 12 volt
[11664.98 --> 11671.46]  lead acid battery for basic functions like you've got access to a high voltage high amperage battery pack
[11671.46 --> 11675.94]  because if you didn't then it would be completely off no one would be operating so you press this
[11675.94 --> 11681.06]  isn't it just a lever it's not just a lever you press the side and it depends not all of them are the
[11681.06 --> 11687.54]  same so there's ones that when you press it it's like you're you're you're you're opening it or or
[11687.54 --> 11692.98]  like the uh the actual retraction like on the uh on the model s it wasn't even a lever if i recall
[11692.98 --> 11699.94]  correctly it was like fully motorized that it would come out so it just depends um i don't know i've
[11699.94 --> 11704.90]  been partial to mini wheats lately but elijah said i couldn't think of a good question for this since it
[11704.90 --> 11710.42]  seems like a no duh moment i don't realize that i had cereal so i don't know um oh yeah i guess it's just
[11710.42 --> 11716.50]  like too many calories for you now too much sugar i haven't been eating as much cereal lately either
[11716.50 --> 11724.02]  i love cereal i'm unhappy we'll get there not yet yeah lidar can damage your camera sensor mkbhd shared
[11724.02 --> 11731.46]  a video showing his damaged camera sensor from the infrared lasers from lidar navigation systems on a car
[11731.46 --> 11736.26]  this is in part due to the class one lasers coming from these sensors but also due to the focusing
[11736.26 --> 11741.86]  effect of the camera's lens here are some shots of the damage from the lidar sensors
[11743.30 --> 11745.94]  rut ro that's a bummer
[11748.58 --> 11752.82]  naturally the closer the sensor the higher the risk of damage the sensor damaging lasers are in
[11752.82 --> 11756.18]  the infrared spectrum which should not pose a threat to your vision as the fluid in your eye
[11756.18 --> 11759.86]  absorbs the infrared light before it would damage your retina this is not health advice i'm not a
[11759.86 --> 11765.54]  doctor so feel free to keep staring directly into those waymos but be careful with your camera sensor
[11766.18 --> 11771.78]  and that's our last topic so why don't we jump into after dark after dark let's do it
[11775.14 --> 11780.50]  man this felt like a long wang show already didn't it i think it was about three and a half hours yeah
[11780.50 --> 11788.10]  yeah oh all right yeah wow neat because we started like are you mocking mostly on time no i'm agreeing
[11788.10 --> 11791.94]  no he's mocking sarcastically he is mocking you see that's what i said that's what i thought
[11792.50 --> 11794.74]  very mockable be gone
[11798.98 --> 11806.66]  my goodness hey linus i'm a huge crosscode fan what made you a fan of the game also are you excited for
[11806.66 --> 11809.86]  alabaster dawn is that their new game have they have they named it
[11809.86 --> 11816.02]  oh what is this two and a half d action rpg from the creators of crosscode
[11816.98 --> 11819.38]  it doesn't have a release date am i supposed to be excited yet
[11819.38 --> 11830.74]  i don't think so no to be announced oh alabaster dawn ooh demo release date demo demo you say
[11830.74 --> 11838.42]  radical fish games i mean there's a dude there's like nothing on here um which was on steam
[11838.42 --> 11847.94]  i mean i'll obviously play it they did the crosscode is so they had they had a playable demo at gamescom
[11849.30 --> 11854.58]  okay so i i thought it was like an online demo but yeah i think it's just a playable demo at
[11854.58 --> 11862.98]  gamescom sounds great can't wait i will i will okay we always say don't pre-order right
[11862.98 --> 11868.58]  but but but but i have actually and i there's some there's some precedent for this
[11869.94 --> 11876.90]  i so remember when i pre-ordered um bill watterson's weird adult graphic novel thing that was
[11876.90 --> 11883.62]  terrible yeah okay and remember do you remember what i said to you though i said no matter how bad
[11883.62 --> 11890.66]  it was you were going to buy it anyways i could never pay mr watterson enough for calvin and hobbes and
[11890.66 --> 11895.38]  what it meant to me and how much entertainment it has given me over the years he won't take my money
[11895.38 --> 11902.82]  in the form of hobbes plushies for my children so if i have to give him um 20 bucks or whatever it is
[11902.82 --> 11911.54]  for his orderly worthless worthless piece of garbage adult novel thing whatever the crap that was
[11912.02 --> 11918.18]  i will do it i will do it happily i'll do it happily i would buy it again um
[11918.18 --> 11925.78]  i'm not saying a lot because it was bad it was awful truly awful yeah um just no maybe not awful but
[11925.78 --> 11940.34]  just pointless um so radical fish same book for me i didn't pay enough for crosscode so i will i will
[11940.34 --> 11948.50]  just buy the new one and if it totally sucks sweaty hairy donkey dick i will still have not paid them
[11948.50 --> 11956.26]  enough for crosscode and i will i will happily i will i will happily uh give them the money make sure
[11956.26 --> 11960.98]  you're wish listing things on steam too that's really important for creators it is actually super
[11960.98 --> 11968.66]  important up next why is it is it just a funding thing nope it's a steam algorithm thing super super
[11968.66 --> 11972.90]  super important because steam doesn't have like an engagement platform yeah sure that's it it's all
[11972.90 --> 11978.98]  that matters and it costs nothing hey y'all last when linus mentioned his daughter starting to model
[11978.98 --> 11985.86]  for the p1s what modeling program do you have her using i use inventor at work and an ex at school but
[11985.86 --> 11993.14]  money money money money for a copy for him um i think she's using like a free tier of tinkercad
[11993.86 --> 11999.94]  it's whatever they like showed her at the little like maker classes that she goes to is is tinkercad
[11999.94 --> 12004.34]  good is yeah yeah that's something else she should be using i think that's like an open-ish source i
[12004.34 --> 12011.38]  can't quite remember but it's pretty good okay better learning tinkercad solidworks future engineer
[12011.38 --> 12019.14]  um hey yeah i've been super super impressed with uh her taking initiative on this because
[12019.14 --> 12029.14]  so cool yeah and and it's so cool she hasn't always been the most self-motivated uh but she is
[12029.14 --> 12038.42]  self-motivated to go and and like fix it when it's not working and to um to learn more about it like the
[12038.42 --> 12043.38]  fact that she's going and learning about filament types and stuff i'm i'm super impressed by because
[12043.38 --> 12046.42]  it's not that simple for like you know someone who's
[12048.98 --> 12055.14]  like still around her first decade i'm trying to see if i have any of the uh stuffed animals she
[12055.14 --> 12060.42]  makes stuffed animals now uh that's another thing that she's gotten into so uh it's wild
[12060.42 --> 12063.70]  yvonne hasn't done the short circuit on it yet but she picked up an embroidery machine
[12063.70 --> 12070.26]  and uh my daughter's been learning how to use that as well so she's uh she's going to be starting to
[12070.26 --> 12080.42]  learn both um uh like additive manufacturing and um some some more like i guess it would still be an
[12080.42 --> 12087.22]  stl right like an embroidery machine probably um is it like vectorized i think yeah i don't know but
[12087.22 --> 12092.18]  she's uh yeah she's svgs and things like think about it like a laser cutter uh embroidery is actually
[12092.18 --> 12098.82]  really weird if you're doing cnc embroidery it's like stitch types and overlaps and it can get
[12098.82 --> 12103.62]  really weird yeah so she's getting into all all kinds of wild stuff these days so cool anyway
[12105.78 --> 12112.34]  okay hey lld love the show linus i was wondering if you had any more thoughts on the oslo sleep buds
[12112.34 --> 12117.62]  after using them for a moment while my mom and i both got pairs after seeing your review and they've
[12117.62 --> 12128.26]  improved i guess sleep um generally i only take those with me on trips um where i still find the
[12128.26 --> 12134.82]  uh the the pairing of the air bot airbods airpods a little bit more painless um but if i'm gonna be
[12134.82 --> 12141.54]  on like a long flight and i really need to not be disrupted by my uh airpods running out of battery
[12141.54 --> 12147.38]  um and i don't mind like kind of setting up because you have to pair to the base station which
[12147.38 --> 12154.26]  pairs to your phone it's a whole thing um really good product really cool product uh but i don't use
[12154.26 --> 12158.66]  them super regularly i should probably give them another shot with the latest updates at home i
[12158.66 --> 12161.14]  haven't used them lately because i haven't done any overseas travel
[12163.78 --> 12170.26]  hello linus this is not a question though actually it is uh you talked before that linux linus is perfectly
[12170.26 --> 12176.10]  capable of building himself a pc what changed uh you just thought to ask yeah i just i don't know i i
[12176.10 --> 12183.78]  summoned the bravery to handle the rejection if he said no and i shot my shot hell yeah and he was
[12183.78 --> 12186.10]  super chill and cool about it hell yeah
[12188.98 --> 12196.50]  with linus torvalds potentially coming onto the show is there a possibility to get on richard stallman and
[12196.50 --> 12202.10]  build him a computer with non-proprietary software we need the stallman build why don't we see how it
[12202.10 --> 12208.82]  goes with mr torvalds first and then we can kind of put together a wish list of super cool computer
[12208.82 --> 12215.30]  industry luminaries to bring onto the show and build computers with i feel like for stallman if we did that
[12215.30 --> 12222.26]  if he was cool with it if if if if um if risk was at a point where it was like legitimate
[12223.14 --> 12228.34]  that would be sick we could i mean we could do a relatively simple build and just put one of those uh
[12228.34 --> 12231.30]  risk five motherboards into like a framework or something yep
[12232.90 --> 12239.22]  could be neat hello bob slob and knob linus what was it like who's who
[12242.58 --> 12248.66]  i mean i feel like bob is the only one that's not horrible i'll take slob you'll take slob i'll take knob
[12248.66 --> 12254.34]  you can be bob you know you're not the one who takes knob
[12257.70 --> 12266.42]  anywho slurp linus what was it like holding a memory module from the saturn 5 rocket
[12266.42 --> 12269.38]  my god it's after dark shut up
[12272.50 --> 12273.46]  i ran out of air
[12275.46 --> 12282.02]  it was like it was like holding history it was it was really cool it um it it's it's one of those
[12282.02 --> 12286.50]  emotional experiences and normally holding a computer component or whatever is not
[12286.50 --> 12292.58]  it's a non-emotional experience but the craftsmanship or should i say craftswoman ship
[12292.58 --> 12298.42]  because apparently the the woven ones yeah the folks who assembled them were dude almost exclusively
[12298.42 --> 12307.14]  women um on display was it was just so apparent um so it was somewhere in between a cool piece of
[12307.14 --> 12315.62]  technology and like literal actual art uh very cool this stuff just just for reference yeah like
[12315.62 --> 12327.70]  what the heck is even going on this is like i i don't know some of that era's technology is wild
[12329.30 --> 12336.50]  my algorithm delivered me the virtual uh inertial reference system with the gyroscopes and the
[12337.14 --> 12342.34]  uh how how how is this the biggest slide rules i was trying to figure out how slide will
[12342.34 --> 12346.74]  work with my dad the other day he learned about them in school never know how he figured it out
[12347.54 --> 12354.26]  uh anyway luke you spoke a bit about classic battlefield last week i also miss maps like battle
[12354.26 --> 12360.50]  of britain filling up a bomber with six players also did you ever play battlefield vietnam yeah i
[12360.50 --> 12364.66]  think i played pretty much all of the old battlefields i didn't know they did a battlefield vietnam that's
[12364.66 --> 12368.90]  a weird war to make a video game about wasn't that i thought that might have been an expansion
[12368.90 --> 12371.30]  i think the problem with the game is that you just can't win
[12373.70 --> 12379.94]  rough um oh yeah yeah is this a full game i remember this actually i think it was an expansion
[12380.58 --> 12388.26]  no it's a full game shut up developed by digital illusions canada i know i played it but i i thought
[12388.26 --> 12392.42]  it was maybe maybe by canadian standards you know the vietnam war wasn't that bad
[12392.42 --> 12401.86]  yeah oh yeah that was like a tuesday i don't think we wrote any conventions that time so like
[12402.42 --> 12407.70]  yeah we didn't what's the we didn't make the what's the point chemicals yeah exactly
[12409.06 --> 12413.14]  maybe they learned from us include us next time apparently was the first with helicopters we have
[12413.14 --> 12423.06]  ideas what if you put what if you put the gas instead of instead of helicopters blades they're
[12423.06 --> 12431.94]  actually blades just more on the bottom chainsaws i'm already hiccuping so much my god i'm sorry but
[12431.94 --> 12437.78]  yeah no i i love battlefield games i think i don't think it's just battlefield the problem i i think
[12438.82 --> 12442.18]  triple triple a as a whole kind of lost the plot there for a long time forgetting that
[12442.18 --> 12448.50]  games needed to be fun um they focused on graphics they focused on um
[12450.26 --> 12457.54]  just a a wide variety of things that weren't just like the game being good and fun um and it seems
[12457.54 --> 12465.86]  like we might maybe in some cases be coming back to that which is cool hopefully the next gta is good
[12465.86 --> 12470.50]  hopefully the next battlefield is good and hopefully we keep going from there but we'll we'll see i can't
[12470.50 --> 12480.34]  even talk heller lemus watched the chromebook video and was wondering what the most awkward situation you
[12480.34 --> 12492.98]  were in when in public i'm sure lots of recognition happens at best buy oh man awkward um man i can't i don't
[12492.98 --> 12500.18]  even know if i can remember anymore every time it's like what was the most x that you y i have such a
[12500.18 --> 12505.14]  hard time like never gonna be accurate it's just gonna be whatever one you remember oh yeah the
[12505.14 --> 12510.74]  worst one you remember that moment like it man i'm like awkward all the time i i had i had an employee
[12511.46 --> 12519.86]  uh come and say bye to me recently because it was their last day and just to shake hands and i was and i was like
[12519.86 --> 12527.78]  i said something like completely wrong i oh yeah i remember what i said i remember what i said i i was i i said
[12527.78 --> 12537.14]  welcome because i just my brain completely the opposite it um what i meant to say was like thanks for
[12537.14 --> 12543.86]  thanks for everything you know and and they were like like i i i said welcome like i've never met them they worked here over two years
[12543.86 --> 12548.58]  like i completely knew who they were and i knew they were coming because i i knew that they had
[12548.58 --> 12553.46]  tendered their resignation a little while ago and i was just like i was like welcome
[12554.90 --> 12562.58]  and then as i tried to recover i made it like way worse um yeah so that wasn't in public but it sucked
[12562.58 --> 12569.22]  that's pretty epic yeah i i just dude i'm when i'm on the spot i just can say just like the dumbest stuff
[12569.22 --> 12573.30]  like i i think i've told the story about the time the border guards asked me where i was going and i said
[12573.30 --> 12577.30]  the wrong place just because i was tense not because i was doing anything illicit
[12579.06 --> 12586.74]  ah anyway where are you off to crimes last one i got for you today oh you missed the chromebook one
[12586.74 --> 12591.78]  did you skip that one i thought that was oh wait that was it yep good job was that it okay thank god
[12591.78 --> 12598.18]  uh would be awesome to know what the pool of mystery items is i would grab a mystery hoodie if that was the
[12598.18 --> 12605.14]  case also i'm colorblind what color is iron cargo pants oh iron is not the ones i'm wearing i'm
[12605.14 --> 12612.26]  wearing the blue ones gray yeah so they're not they're what you see yeah uh yeah yeah yeah you
[12612.26 --> 12616.90]  should yeah you should be able to handle it um pool of mystery items yeah but that's the point of
[12616.90 --> 12620.58]  mystery items is that they're kind of whatever they are and that's why they're cheaper would make it
[12620.58 --> 12626.66]  really tedious because it like constantly changes yeah so so it's supposed to be a low-cost way of
[12626.66 --> 12633.46]  liquidating stuff that we need to liquidate for whatever reason and actual last one howdy lld have
[12633.46 --> 12642.58]  you guys heard about the ddos attacks happening to fa forever fa forever forever uh supreme commander
[12642.58 --> 12649.78]  oh the new one yeah uh no no the old one the old one forged alliance forever it's a community project
[12649.78 --> 12655.14]  the fact that someone's attacking this is oh damn whoever's attacking this is a butthole they are
[12655.14 --> 12665.30]  asking for help defending like a sphincter tight no no damn and dirty no yeah the continuous unwashed
[12665.30 --> 12674.18]  stinks it leaks the continuation of uh fa forever on their form um yeah i hadn't heard about the ddos

[12714.74 --> 12725.06]  oh um yeah oh this is such a bummer to read um the past decade of the internet the past decade
[12725.06 --> 12728.98]  the internet has changed significantly in my personal view the internet used to be more innocent
[12728.98 --> 12733.46]  as a small open source service provider such as fa forever it was unthinkable that we would be the
[12733.46 --> 12737.86]  target of malicious actors yep and because of that the infrastructure was never designed to be
[12737.86 --> 12741.94]  resilient of course their basic authentication and authorization checks but in general our implementation
[12741.94 --> 12744.50]  assumed the user consuming the service acted in good faith
[12748.58 --> 12751.30]  yeah a lot of the internet kind of just sucks now
[12754.74 --> 12755.06]  man
[12758.90 --> 12760.34]  this is so not cool
