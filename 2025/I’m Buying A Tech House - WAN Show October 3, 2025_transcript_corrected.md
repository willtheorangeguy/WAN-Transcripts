[0.00 → 7.80] What's up everyone?
[8.74 → 9.84] Happy Friday
[9.84 → 12.26] and welcome to the WAN show
[12.26 → 15.70] Hi
[15.70 → 17.66] You okay?
[18.06 → 19.90] Your stomach went crazy
[19.90 → 21.76] right when this show started
[21.76 → 24.18] Got a great show lined up for you guys
[24.18 → 26.16] today. We're going to be talking about
[26.16 → 27.62] our plan
[27.62 → 30.10] See, we don't have anything
[30.10 → 31.94] to upgrade in my house
[31.94 → 34.16] So we're going to
[34.16 → 36.16] get a tech house that is
[36.16 → 38.34] not a tech house, but we're going to make it a tech house
[38.34 → 40.18] It will become one. And we're going to need your
[40.18 → 41.14] help because
[41.14 → 44.32] there's going to be a right way to do this
[44.32 → 46.04] and then there's going to be all the
[46.04 → 48.26] other options that we have available to
[48.26 → 49.88] us and we want to know
[49.88 → 51.92] what direction you guys want to see it go
[51.92 → 53.80] We're also going to be talking about
[53.80 → 56.30] Oh, yeah, Xbox might be dying
[56.30 → 58.84] So that's pretty cool
[58.84 → 60.38] Um, like literally
[60.38 → 61.66] Costco pulled
[61.66 → 63.00] Boxes off the shelf
[63.00 → 64.12] Like
[64.12 → 64.62] Crazy
[64.62 → 65.24] What?
[65.42 → 66.28] That's a huge
[66.28 → 67.90] Yeah, that's a big moment
[67.90 → 68.36] What?
[68.66 → 69.96] Anyway, what else we got this week?
[70.04 → 71.62] EA is going private
[71.62 → 73.42] in the largest private equity
[73.42 → 74.08] buyout
[74.08 → 75.18] ever
[75.18 → 76.02] I thought you were going to pick
[76.02 → 76.60] good news
[76.60 → 78.60] Did you think it was bad already?
[79.78 → 80.84] Wait for what's
[80.84 → 81.78] coming next
[81.78 → 83.70] And speaking of coming next
[83.70 → 84.74] after that we have
[84.74 → 86.50] various ad hoc
[86.50 → 87.46] Linus topics
[87.46 → 89.32] which I'm unironically
[89.32 → 89.94] excited for
[89.94 → 90.70] That'll be good
[90.70 → 91.64] That'll be a good part of the story
[91.64 → 92.96] It's going to be a very good part
[92.96 → 93.50] of the show
[93.50 → 94.52] What does that have to do
[94.52 → 95.54] with sexual innuendo?
[95.54 → 118.50] The show is brought to you today by
[118.50 → 119.26] MSI
[119.26 → 120.12] Forum
[120.12 → 120.66] Squarespace
[120.66 → 121.92] and XSplit
[121.92 → 122.46] And of course
[122.46 → 123.08] that is alongside
[123.08 → 123.86] our wrap partner
[123.86 → 124.96] Rebrand our laptop partner
[124.96 → 125.82] Dell and our chair partner
[125.82 → 126.42] Secret Lab
[126.42 → 127.64] See if I read them faster
[127.64 → 128.80] Having more sponsors
[128.80 → 129.98] doesn't actually take up
[129.98 → 130.78] anyone's time
[130.78 → 132.18] any more than it already did
[132.18 → 132.58] I like that
[132.58 → 133.46] We have to get to the point
[133.46 → 134.86] where you're like an auctioneer
[134.86 → 136.56] You have to like
[136.56 → 138.18] actually take auctioneer classes
[138.18 → 138.72] and they're like
[138.72 → 140.52] I don't think I
[140.52 → 141.68] I don't think I could do it
[141.68 → 142.60] I really don't think
[142.60 → 143.62] I can talk that fast
[143.62 → 144.78] especially not with these
[144.78 → 145.48] cutting up my mouth
[145.48 → 146.74] Once the braces are out maybe
[146.74 → 148.32] Let's jump right into
[148.32 → 149.26] our headline topic
[149.26 → 150.40] which is of course
[150.40 → 151.48] the tech house
[151.48 → 152.78] This has been
[152.78 → 154.14] on various stages
[154.14 → 155.42] of front burner
[155.42 → 156.26] back burner
[156.26 → 157.30] side burner
[157.30 → 158.22] after burner
[158.22 → 160.88] for probably years
[160.88 → 161.96] at this point
[161.96 → 162.38] with
[162.38 → 163.68] In different forms
[163.68 → 164.46] Varying
[164.46 → 165.48] varying degrees
[165.48 → 166.82] of sort of
[166.82 → 167.72] plausibility
[167.72 → 169.32] and different people
[169.32 → 170.06] sort of supporting
[170.06 → 170.62] the initiative
[170.62 → 171.30] But
[171.30 → 171.64] At one point
[171.64 → 172.64] it was a hotel
[172.64 → 174.14] Oh that was
[174.14 → 174.86] kind of different
[174.86 → 175.16] Okay
[175.16 → 176.30] That was pretty different
[176.30 → 177.72] But I'd say
[177.72 → 178.94] the origin
[178.94 → 179.68] of the idea
[179.68 → 180.60] goes all the way
[180.60 → 181.36] back to
[181.36 → 181.98] Colton
[181.98 → 182.86] basically
[182.86 → 183.96] trying to figure out
[183.96 → 184.74] how to get
[184.74 → 185.62] Linus Media Group
[185.62 → 186.28] to substitute
[186.28 → 186.86] his home
[186.86 → 187.56] or subsidize
[187.56 → 188.06] his home
[188.06 → 191.70] We were pretty clear
[191.70 → 192.58] that probably
[192.58 → 193.64] won't make a ton of sense
[193.64 → 194.58] That's hilarious
[194.58 → 195.26] because a lot of people
[195.26 → 195.80] in full plane chat
[195.80 → 196.58] seem to be convinced
[196.58 → 197.40] that it's my house
[197.40 → 197.76] No
[197.76 → 199.42] Just buying a house
[199.42 → 200.02] for Colton
[200.02 → 200.98] So I think
[200.98 → 201.86] his original pitch
[201.86 → 202.26] to me
[202.26 → 203.36] was something along
[203.36 → 204.00] the lines of
[204.00 → 204.42] okay
[204.42 → 205.48] hear me out
[205.48 → 207.48] The company
[207.48 → 208.38] buys a house
[208.38 → 209.64] I rent it
[209.64 → 210.20] for cheap
[210.20 → 211.42] and live in the basement
[211.42 → 212.54] and the company
[212.54 → 213.38] uses the upstairs
[213.38 → 214.06] to do like
[214.06 → 214.96] tech house things
[214.96 → 216.08] and then like
[216.08 → 216.84] if I like it
[216.84 → 217.66] I'll buy it after
[217.66 → 218.62] and I was like
[218.62 → 220.02] so basically
[220.02 → 220.62] you just want
[220.62 → 221.66] the deal Luke had
[221.66 → 223.64] Which was so good
[223.64 → 225.24] So I can't blame him
[225.24 → 226.04] Back when we were
[226.04 → 226.64] working out of
[226.64 → 227.56] the Langley house
[227.56 → 228.56] as a studio
[228.56 → 229.78] and
[229.78 → 230.90] I
[230.90 → 232.36] pretty much was like
[232.36 → 232.84] Colton
[232.84 → 233.66] you understand
[233.66 → 234.78] the hundred or so
[234.78 → 235.34] reasons
[235.34 → 236.66] namely all of your
[236.66 → 237.70] fellow employees
[237.70 → 239.10] that that is not fair
[239.10 → 240.70] and we cannot do that
[240.70 → 241.02] right
[241.02 → 241.88] and he's like
[241.88 → 243.04] okay
[243.04 → 244.56] but
[244.56 → 245.98] we've given it
[245.98 → 246.58] a lot of thought
[246.58 → 247.54] and we've
[247.54 → 248.40] kind of assessed
[248.40 → 249.00] a lot of the
[249.00 → 249.66] different options
[249.66 → 250.98] and I think
[250.98 → 251.98] there is a path
[251.98 → 252.34] forward
[252.34 → 252.64] now
[252.64 → 254.10] if you're a regular
[254.10 → 254.84] watcher of the show
[254.84 → 255.68] you'll probably know
[255.68 → 256.86] that I'm not
[256.86 → 257.88] super comfortable
[257.88 → 258.80] with the idea
[258.80 → 260.26] of residential housing
[260.26 → 261.90] as an investable
[261.90 → 262.72] commodity
[262.72 → 263.54] and it's not
[263.54 → 264.36] something that
[264.36 → 264.86] I want to
[264.86 → 265.68] participate in
[265.68 → 267.30] I kind of have
[267.30 → 267.58] a
[267.58 → 269.00] I kind of have
[269.00 → 269.44] a
[269.44 → 270.32] like a
[270.32 → 272.26] a sports day
[272.26 → 273.34] approach
[273.34 → 274.08] to
[274.08 → 274.88] sort of
[274.88 → 275.94] housing allocation
[275.94 → 277.54] you know
[277.54 → 278.42] they brought
[278.42 → 279.06] some food
[279.06 → 280.44] everybody's working
[280.44 → 280.82] hard
[280.82 → 281.76] everybody's hungry
[281.76 → 283.70] if you want
[283.70 → 284.34] a second one
[284.34 → 285.38] that's totally cool
[285.38 → 285.90] but you should
[285.90 → 286.42] probably wait
[286.42 → 287.20] till everybody's
[287.20 → 287.88] had their first
[287.88 → 288.70] you know
[288.70 → 289.64] right
[289.64 → 290.82] just be a good
[290.82 → 291.50] fellow citizen
[291.50 → 292.54] and
[292.54 → 294.04] and to be clear
[294.04 → 294.40] you know
[294.40 → 295.14] I didn't know
[295.14 → 295.64] where that was going
[295.64 → 296.16] but I like
[296.16 → 296.78] it's a good analogy
[296.78 → 297.64] no, no no
[297.64 → 298.68] disrespect to anyone
[298.68 → 299.46] who you know
[299.46 → 300.72] does land lording
[300.72 → 301.78] stuff or whatever
[301.78 → 302.46] everyone's got
[302.46 → 303.30] their own personal
[303.30 → 304.66] sort of value system
[304.66 → 305.68] and what works for
[305.68 → 306.66] me might not work
[306.66 → 306.96] for you
[306.96 → 307.62] and vice versa
[307.62 → 308.84] and you know
[308.84 → 309.38] no disrespect
[309.38 → 310.48] for people who
[310.48 → 310.78] you know
[310.78 → 311.40] have a vacation
[311.40 → 311.86] property
[311.86 → 312.54] or you know
[312.54 → 313.16] whatever else
[313.16 → 313.72] I think if you
[313.72 → 314.24] have a cabin
[314.24 → 314.74] by the lake
[314.74 → 315.18] somewhere
[315.18 → 316.58] you know
[316.58 → 317.40] that's that
[317.40 → 318.14] power to you
[318.14 → 319.08] or whatever else
[319.08 → 319.52] but it's
[319.52 → 320.18] it's not for me
[320.18 → 322.50] and so
[322.50 → 323.46] finding a way
[323.46 → 325.28] to buy a house
[325.28 → 326.64] because like
[326.64 → 327.14] what
[327.14 → 327.98] we're going to lease
[327.98 → 328.82] one and make a
[328.82 → 329.44] bunch of improvements
[329.44 → 329.84] to it
[329.84 → 330.36] like you have to be
[330.36 → 330.84] kidding me right
[330.84 → 331.06] no
[331.06 → 331.86] right so
[331.86 → 333.30] so buying
[333.30 → 334.30] buying a house
[334.30 → 335.74] finding a way
[335.74 → 336.22] to do that
[336.22 → 336.70] in a market
[336.70 → 337.48] like Vancouver
[337.48 → 338.04] which is
[338.04 → 339.36] quite literally
[339.36 → 341.06] in the top
[341.06 → 342.00] if not top
[342.00 → 342.72] three
[342.72 → 343.86] definitely top
[343.86 → 344.60] five
[344.60 → 346.36] most unfavourable
[346.36 → 347.32] housing markets
[347.32 → 348.46] in the entire
[348.46 → 349.14] world
[349.14 → 350.44] for the sole
[350.44 → 351.50] purpose of
[351.50 → 352.70] making videos
[352.70 → 353.14] in it
[353.14 → 356.10] the optics
[356.10 → 356.62] aren't great
[356.62 → 356.98] questionable
[356.98 → 358.12] at the very least
[358.12 → 359.02] definitely
[359.02 → 359.68] questionable
[359.68 → 360.22] yeah
[360.22 → 361.28] but I came up
[361.28 → 362.08] with an idea
[362.08 → 363.04] that I think
[363.04 → 364.14] people are mostly
[364.14 → 365.08] going to vibe with
[365.08 → 366.14] so I'm thinking
[366.14 → 367.18] we find something
[367.18 → 368.04] that is
[368.04 → 371.64] probably not
[371.64 → 372.68] easily within reach
[372.68 → 373.38] of the average
[373.38 → 374.32] Vancouver
[374.32 → 375.18] but something
[375.18 → 375.90] that from at
[375.90 → 376.32] least kind
[376.32 → 377.00] of the outside
[377.00 → 378.24] will look like
[378.24 → 378.90] kind of normal
[378.90 → 380.00] single family home
[380.00 → 380.70] in a lot of
[380.70 → 381.36] like you know
[381.36 → 381.94] the United States
[381.94 → 382.92] Midwest or whatever
[382.92 → 383.84] you know like
[383.84 → 384.64] it'll, it'll be
[384.64 → 385.26] kind of
[385.26 → 385.58] you know
[385.58 → 386.52] small yard
[386.52 → 387.36] front and back
[387.36 → 388.66] and I'm aiming
[388.66 → 389.28] for like
[389.28 → 390.40] anywhere between
[390.40 → 391.62] about 1800
[391.62 → 392.46] square feet
[392.46 → 393.84] 2500 square feet
[393.84 → 395.06] if we could
[395.06 → 395.64] find something
[395.64 → 396.38] that was a touch
[396.38 → 396.86] on the bigger
[396.86 → 397.96] side like 28
[397.96 → 399.08] 2900 square feet
[399.08 → 399.58] and it had a
[399.58 → 400.18] basement level
[400.18 → 400.98] I think that
[400.98 → 401.42] would be pretty
[401.42 → 401.96] cool because
[401.96 → 402.30] that would
[402.30 → 403.14] unlock a lot
[403.14 → 403.60] of content
[403.60 → 403.98] options
[403.98 → 404.60] more like
[404.60 → 405.86] sets
[405.86 → 407.30] areas to work
[407.30 → 408.04] on things to
[408.04 → 408.40] do
[408.40 → 408.88] it's
[408.88 → 409.66] modes for the
[409.66 → 410.38] house to be in
[410.38 → 411.30] it's cooler
[411.30 → 412.12] stuff that we can
[412.12 → 412.96] do for sure
[412.96 → 413.18] right
[413.18 → 414.82] and then
[414.82 → 416.18] the idea
[416.18 → 416.66] here
[416.66 → 417.70] and there are
[417.70 → 418.26] some there are
[418.26 → 419.26] still some like
[419.26 → 420.80] tax and
[420.80 → 422.44] some tax
[422.44 → 423.02] implications
[423.02 → 424.10] especially that we
[424.10 → 424.64] would have to
[424.64 → 425.34] figure out around
[425.34 → 426.18] this but the
[426.18 → 426.72] idea
[426.72 → 428.12] don't hold me
[428.12 → 428.46] to this
[428.46 → 429.46] is that we
[429.46 → 430.08] would buy the
[430.08 → 430.40] house
[430.40 → 431.26] okay
[431.26 → 432.64] we would make
[432.64 → 433.46] a bunch of
[433.46 → 434.22] tech improvements
[434.22 → 436.22] and the law
[436.22 → 437.50] stipulates that
[437.50 → 438.56] or tax law
[438.56 → 439.62] stipulates that
[439.62 → 440.34] when you sell an
[440.34 → 441.34] asset it has to
[441.34 → 442.38] be for something
[442.38 → 443.62] resembling a market
[443.62 → 444.62] value right
[444.62 → 445.32] because otherwise
[445.32 → 447.08] you could you
[447.08 → 447.66] could make the
[447.66 → 448.94] argument that
[448.94 → 449.86] um
[449.86 → 452.12] are we still
[452.12 → 452.46] live
[452.46 → 455.68] it appears so
[455.68 → 456.74] otherwise you
[456.74 → 457.26] could make the
[457.26 → 458.36] argument that
[458.36 → 459.02] um
[459.02 → 459.98] if you bought it
[459.98 → 460.68] for instance
[460.68 → 461.50] you would be
[461.50 → 462.48] receiving uh
[462.48 → 463.32] like a cash
[463.32 → 464.28] equivalent benefit
[464.28 → 465.30] right like if I
[465.30 → 465.74] were to say
[465.74 → 466.70] uh I
[466.70 → 467.92] oh I bought this
[467.92 → 468.64] house for one
[468.64 → 469.68] million dollars
[469.68 → 470.96] very funny
[470.96 → 471.78] haha Vancouver
[471.78 → 472.36] yeah right
[472.36 → 473.62] but I bought this
[473.62 → 474.22] house for one
[474.22 → 474.92] million dollars
[474.92 → 476.20] and um
[476.20 → 477.58] Luke I'm not
[477.58 → 478.54] gonna I'm not
[478.54 → 479.32] going to pay you at
[479.32 → 480.08] work this year
[480.08 → 481.26] but uh
[481.26 → 483.48] I'm going to sell
[483.48 → 484.06] you this house
[484.06 → 485.86] for ten dollars
[485.86 → 487.52] hey nice
[487.52 → 488.26] don't worry about
[488.26 → 489.20] income tax
[489.20 → 490.88] right because you
[490.88 → 491.46] didn't have any
[491.46 → 492.14] income right
[492.14 → 493.28] well the government
[493.28 → 493.84] thought of that
[493.84 → 494.40] that's perfect
[494.40 → 495.22] oh yeah right
[495.22 → 496.08] exactly
[496.08 → 496.74] jerks
[496.74 → 497.42] so you're not
[497.42 → 498.08] you're not really
[498.08 → 498.92] allowed to do that
[498.92 → 499.44] when you sell
[499.44 → 500.34] something you have
[500.34 → 501.04] to sell it for
[501.04 → 502.02] something resembling
[502.02 → 503.28] a market value
[503.28 → 504.60] and look we can
[504.60 → 505.80] we can talk all day
[505.80 → 506.52] about whether that
[506.52 → 507.34] rule makes any
[507.34 → 507.94] sense or whether
[507.94 → 508.60] we like it
[508.60 → 510.92] that's just the way
[510.92 → 511.24] it is
[511.24 → 511.74] that's the way
[511.74 → 512.22] it is here
[512.22 → 513.20] and we get
[513.20 → 514.04] audited frequently
[514.04 → 515.10] enough that it
[515.10 → 515.76] would it would be
[515.76 → 516.68] noticed even if we
[516.68 → 517.38] were like oh yeah
[517.38 → 518.02] well we're just
[518.02 → 518.66] gonna we're gonna
[518.66 → 519.12] do it anyway
[519.12 → 521.48] so something that
[521.48 → 522.36] I noticed though
[522.36 → 523.28] is you know
[523.28 → 524.42] between my own
[524.42 → 525.48] uh house shopping
[525.48 → 526.26] over the years
[526.26 → 527.74] and uh chatting
[527.74 → 528.58] with other folks
[528.58 → 529.40] who have also been
[529.40 → 530.20] shopping for homes
[530.20 → 532.10] is that occasionally
[532.10 → 533.26] people do sell a
[533.26 → 534.08] home uh fully
[534.08 → 534.50] furnished
[534.50 → 536.20] and one of the
[536.20 → 537.12] things I've noticed
[537.12 → 537.78] about that
[537.78 → 538.76] is that
[538.76 → 540.12] the pricing
[540.12 → 541.06] generally is
[541.06 → 541.78] doesn't change
[541.78 → 543.04] not very reflective
[543.04 → 543.56] yeah
[543.56 → 545.00] of all the stuff
[545.00 → 545.96] that's in the house
[545.96 → 546.98] which kind of makes
[546.98 → 547.54] sense because
[547.54 → 548.10] my place didn't come
[548.10 → 549.12] fully furnished but it
[549.12 → 549.92] was genuinely really
[549.92 → 550.74] close and that was
[550.74 → 551.96] valued at literally
[551.96 → 552.36] nothing
[552.36 → 553.18] the dead guy's stuff
[553.18 → 553.42] right
[553.42 → 553.74] yep
[553.74 → 554.02] yeah
[554.02 → 554.80] so
[554.80 → 557.20] here's my idea
[557.20 → 559.04] we come in
[559.04 → 560.78] we buy the house
[560.78 → 561.80] for let's say
[561.80 → 563.06] a million dollars
[563.06 → 564.46] we do a bunch
[564.46 → 565.56] of stuff on it
[565.56 → 566.56] I think we're
[566.56 → 567.28] going to have to keep
[567.28 → 568.00] it for at least
[568.00 → 568.54] two years
[568.54 → 569.36] have you seen
[569.36 → 570.16] the new uh
[570.16 → 570.76] the new taxes
[570.76 → 571.92] on I don't know
[571.92 → 572.56] if they're in place
[572.56 → 573.12] yet but they
[573.12 → 574.00] they're either in
[574.00 → 574.62] place or they're
[574.62 → 575.92] coming on people
[575.92 → 576.92] who flip a house
[576.92 → 577.64] in less than
[577.64 → 578.12] two years
[578.12 → 578.98] I had no idea
[578.98 → 579.92] yeah I that's
[579.92 → 580.82] I saw that I
[580.82 → 581.26] don't I don't
[581.26 → 581.68] know if that's
[581.68 → 582.24] confirmed yet
[582.24 → 582.66] honestly you're
[582.66 → 583.18] probably gonna need
[583.18 → 583.66] that much time
[583.66 → 584.28] to like do
[584.28 → 584.60] everything
[584.60 → 585.62] I think so too
[585.62 → 586.20] I think we're
[586.20 → 586.96] going to have a lot
[586.96 → 587.58] to do I'm gonna
[587.58 → 588.18] with the amount
[588.18 → 589.06] of ideas that I've
[589.06 → 589.60] thought of just
[589.60 → 590.82] sitting here so far
[590.82 → 591.50] oh dude
[591.50 → 592.66] I want like
[592.66 → 593.74] oh man I
[593.74 → 594.22] want to do
[594.22 → 595.48] geothermal on
[595.48 → 596.00] it is like I
[596.00 → 596.90] want to do I
[596.90 → 597.58] want to do so
[597.58 → 598.46] much stuff
[598.46 → 599.90] basically everything
[599.90 → 601.02] that I was
[601.02 → 602.00] budget constrained
[602.00 → 602.70] or time
[602.70 → 603.84] constrained or
[603.84 → 605.00] constrained by the
[605.00 → 605.58] fact that I have
[605.58 → 606.26] to live in it
[606.26 → 607.28] everything I
[607.28 → 607.98] wanted to do
[607.98 → 608.78] with my house
[608.78 → 610.48] I want to do
[610.48 → 611.04] in this one
[611.04 → 612.76] and one of the
[612.76 → 613.48] conversations I
[613.48 → 614.28] had with James
[614.28 → 616.22] was that okay
[616.22 → 616.78] let's let's get
[616.78 → 617.32] to the conversation
[617.32 → 617.94] with James later
[617.94 → 618.60] first let's finish
[618.60 → 619.14] the thought about
[619.14 → 619.52] how we're gonna
[619.52 → 620.74] do this so
[620.74 → 621.28] we spend our
[621.28 → 621.96] couple of years
[621.96 → 622.70] working on it
[622.70 → 623.56] and then
[623.56 → 624.56] whatever market
[624.56 → 625.52] fluctuation has
[625.52 → 626.18] happened in that
[626.18 → 627.44] time we basically
[627.44 → 628.84] go okay how
[628.84 → 629.78] about this how
[629.78 → 630.58] about just making
[630.58 → 631.30] sure that we cover
[631.30 → 632.10] all of our costs
[632.10 → 632.86] because not
[632.86 → 633.66] everything we put
[633.66 → 634.36] into the house is
[634.36 → 635.56] going to be sent by
[635.56 → 636.78] the manufacturer or
[636.78 → 637.60] a sponsor or
[637.60 → 638.58] whatever but just
[638.58 → 639.34] to cover the stuff
[639.34 → 640.08] that we have to
[640.08 → 640.74] put in ourselves
[640.74 → 642.56] and whatever the
[642.56 → 645.30] market is it goes
[645.30 → 646.12] out like that and
[646.12 → 647.50] we just if we put
[647.50 → 648.52] in the world's
[648.52 → 649.30] the biggest TV or
[649.30 → 650.82] whatever I don't
[650.82 → 651.56] know I mean it's
[651.56 → 652.86] in their like you
[652.86 → 653.56] might not like the
[653.56 → 654.52] TV so we don't
[654.52 → 655.10] really know how to
[655.10 → 656.06] value that so
[656.06 → 658.76] yeah because the
[658.76 → 660.26] the actual house
[660.26 → 661.38] and we put it on
[661.38 → 661.70] the market
[661.70 → 666.12] value it is super
[666.12 → 667.34] sketch to sell below
[667.34 → 668.20] a certain amount
[668.20 → 669.88] yeah you like can't
[669.88 → 670.88] so you can
[670.88 → 672.30] sell it cheaply
[672.30 → 673.74] yeah even though we
[673.74 → 674.56] probably wouldn't
[674.56 → 675.08] because we're gonna
[675.08 → 676.32] put a ton of money
[676.32 → 677.26] into it yeah sure
[677.26 → 678.60] like way more than
[678.60 → 679.34] would be reasonable
[679.34 → 680.20] like if we bought a
[680.20 → 681.46] house for 1.5
[681.46 → 682.62] how do you decide
[682.62 → 683.36] who we could to
[683.36 → 684.30] buy it though
[684.30 → 687.28] uh okay so see
[687.28 → 688.26] that because I've
[688.26 → 688.98] since I've heard
[688.98 → 689.88] this idea I've been
[689.88 → 690.84] stuck on that part
[690.84 → 692.22] so how does that
[692.22 → 694.84] work I don't know
[694.84 → 696.86] I'm not really there
[696.86 → 697.98] yet we're we're
[697.98 → 699.02] probably three to
[699.02 → 699.70] six months from
[699.70 → 700.48] actually purchasing
[700.48 → 701.78] it we're probably
[701.78 → 702.94] six to nine months
[702.94 → 703.62] from uploading the
[703.62 → 704.50] first video in it
[704.50 → 705.84] and we're almost
[705.84 → 706.62] three years from
[706.62 → 706.94] when we're gonna
[706.94 → 707.50] have to deal with
[707.50 → 708.10] this yeah speaking
[708.10 → 708.76] of someone in
[708.76 → 709.58] full plane chat
[709.58 → 710.74] yeah barred from
[710.74 → 713.08] employees so um
[713.08 → 714.94] you and Elijah I
[714.94 → 715.70] think are now the
[715.70 → 717.04] like eighth and
[717.04 → 718.14] ninth person to
[718.14 → 718.90] bring up that you're
[718.90 → 719.54] going to be the one who
[719.54 → 720.54] wants to buy it I'm
[720.54 → 722.24] sure so hear me out
[722.24 → 725.02] whole new series
[725.02 → 727.26] this time sponsored
[727.26 → 728.52] by nvidia
[728.52 → 730.12] five hundred thousand
[730.12 → 730.74] dollar ultimate
[730.74 → 731.48] house upgrade
[731.48 → 734.26] I think they got the
[734.26 → 735.48] money for it oh my
[735.48 → 736.38] goodness they could
[736.38 → 737.30] afford it that would
[737.30 → 738.44] be amazing so we
[738.44 → 739.20] turn we turn the
[739.20 → 740.48] entire channel into
[740.48 → 741.94] just like a tech
[741.94 → 743.20] house Reno channel
[743.20 → 745.28] wow okay so after
[745.28 → 746.68] the first one we
[746.68 → 748.80] just keep going I
[748.80 → 749.44] mean why would we
[749.44 → 750.00] have to have this
[750.00 → 750.96] one going at a time
[750.96 → 752.14] it's we have to wait
[752.14 → 753.18] around for a year
[753.18 → 754.54] worth of content oh
[754.54 → 756.08] easy per one so
[756.08 → 757.44] like it kind of does
[757.44 → 758.54] potentially make sense
[758.54 → 759.58] that's wild Elijah
[759.58 → 760.36] says how about we
[760.36 → 761.30] fight each other to the
[761.30 → 762.12] death the winner gets
[762.12 → 762.80] it Elijah you don't
[762.80 → 763.22] you don't want to
[763.22 → 765.98] fight lube that's
[765.98 → 766.86] actually fucking
[766.86 → 768.06] stupid my guy there's
[768.06 → 768.82] people at the company
[768.82 → 769.48] though that would be
[769.48 → 771.00] very terrifying um
[771.00 → 775.38] okay so anyway since
[775.38 → 776.20] unlike some other
[776.20 → 776.98] YouTubers I'm not
[776.98 → 777.94] actually trying to
[777.94 → 778.60] create real life
[778.60 → 780.70] hunger games um or
[780.70 → 781.84] sorry rather the other
[781.84 → 785.30] one um let's talk
[785.30 → 786.16] about the conversation
[786.16 → 788.22] with jams because a
[788.22 → 789.40] big part of the issue
[789.40 → 790.28] with a lot of the
[790.28 → 791.12] upgrades that we did at
[791.12 → 792.32] my house was that
[792.32 → 794.62] there was no there
[794.62 → 796.24] was no customer for
[796.24 → 797.76] it is like I was just
[797.76 → 799.12] kind of doing weird
[799.12 → 800.40] stuff that I would do
[800.40 → 802.20] for myself and so I
[802.20 → 802.98] ended up with a lot of
[802.98 → 804.82] stuff that was never
[804.82 → 805.94] really fully finished
[805.94 → 806.72] squid game that's what
[806.72 → 807.18] I was thinking of
[807.18 → 808.16] that was never really
[808.16 → 809.62] fully finished or that
[809.62 → 810.96] didn't really make
[810.96 → 812.74] sense for most people
[812.74 → 815.18] right like the average
[815.18 → 816.24] person like if I don't
[816.24 → 817.24] know who's going to buy a
[817.24 → 818.96] house I have to Reno it
[818.96 → 820.02] in a completely different
[820.02 → 821.02] way from if I'm building
[821.02 → 822.08] some weird thing for
[822.08 → 823.66] myself so instead of
[823.66 → 825.20] using home assistant I
[825.20 → 827.24] probably use homey you
[827.24 → 828.44] know what I mean I see
[828.44 → 832.00] I'm so uh I don't even
[832.00 → 834.96] know homey you're looking
[834.96 → 837.74] it up yeah, yeah so this
[837.74 → 840.32] it's basically it's kind
[840.32 → 842.36] of um it's along the lines
[842.36 → 843.94] of what home assistant is
[843.94 → 845.66] trying to do bringing all
[845.66 → 847.40] the disparate ecosystems
[847.40 → 850.44] into one management
[850.44 → 853.04] platform, but it is it
[853.04 → 854.20] just more user-friendly
[854.20 → 856.68] but more closed it's more
[856.68 → 859.44] user-friendly um, and it's
[859.44 → 860.74] uh, and you have to like
[860.74 → 862.12] pay a subscription whereas
[862.12 → 863.06] home assistant you can do
[863.06 → 864.44] everything yourself I believe
[864.44 → 864.88] so actually
[864.88 → 865.00] are you sure it shouldn't
[865.00 → 865.88] just be home assistant
[865.88 → 868.24] no I'm not sure if I'm not
[868.24 → 869.72] sure in fact there's uh
[869.72 → 872.18] there's one bloke um that
[872.18 → 873.22] I can't say much about
[873.22 → 874.54] because he's working on
[874.54 → 876.12] some cool stuff that I
[876.12 → 877.84] can't say much about but
[877.84 → 880.20] maybe home assistant could
[880.20 → 881.40] get more user-friendly in
[881.40 → 882.48] the future I mean we're
[882.48 → 883.28] talking about something
[883.28 → 883.98] that we're not going to
[883.98 → 885.28] deploy for a couple of
[885.28 → 886.60] years yeah at this point
[886.60 → 888.56] uh, but I'm basically just
[888.56 → 890.10] using that as an example
[890.10 → 891.44] of how we might do
[891.44 → 892.48] something a little bit
[892.48 → 894.80] differently instead of um
[894.80 → 897.04] having a cooling loop that
[897.04 → 898.64] is run into the walls of
[898.64 → 900.14] the pool to cool the
[900.14 → 901.62] mechanical room you know
[901.62 → 902.92] we might just do something
[902.92 → 907.54] where um we have like uh
[907.54 → 908.78] oh yeah we might just not
[908.78 → 909.48] do that
[909.48 → 916.80] just an idea or
[916.80 → 918.66] some or some of the cool
[918.66 → 920.12] ideas that have actually
[920.12 → 921.16] worked out really well at my
[921.16 → 922.92] place like the land room is
[922.92 → 925.30] awesome you could offer oh
[925.30 → 927.68] like we could just but we
[927.68 → 928.48] could do it more user
[928.48 → 929.70] friendly we'd make sure that
[929.70 → 930.96] there's actually you know
[930.96 → 932.66] power buttons you know
[932.66 → 933.72] next to all the machines
[933.72 → 934.66] you know we'd have like a
[934.66 → 935.62] nice little plate in the
[935.62 → 937.04] wall that has all the
[937.04 → 937.44] O and everything
[937.44 → 939.40] what if you offered one
[939.40 → 943.28] year of quarterly tech
[943.28 → 947.12] maintenance for free as
[947.12 → 948.20] long as you were allowed to
[948.20 → 949.88] film it after the sale
[949.88 → 952.96] that's been an offer uh it
[952.96 → 954.76] can't for sure go with it
[954.76 → 957.00] I don't know it'd be
[957.00 → 958.26] interesting to see like the
[958.26 → 959.58] decay I don't know if that
[959.58 → 960.90] would be free because I
[960.90 → 961.86] don't want to do it
[961.86 → 963.62] mmm I was just be for
[963.62 → 965.56] filming yeah and it
[965.56 → 967.30] wouldn't be you okay I
[967.30 → 968.40] don't know I no
[968.40 → 969.72] commitment yeah no
[969.72 → 970.70] commitment on that
[970.70 → 972.52] anyway I'd be interested
[972.52 → 974.02] to see how the stewards of
[974.02 → 975.44] the home like took care of
[975.44 → 979.10] the stuff yeah I don't want
[979.10 → 980.14] that to be my problem
[980.14 → 983.46] sure, but I do want to have
[983.46 → 984.58] everything set up in such a
[984.58 → 985.84] way that conceivably
[985.84 → 988.26] whoever takes it on could
[988.26 → 989.80] use this stuff so like are
[989.80 → 991.90] you going to rip to studs I
[991.90 → 993.12] don't know if we'd have to
[993.12 → 994.76] I don't know if you saw uh
[994.76 → 996.66] did you see Josh Chan's uh
[996.66 → 997.94] AMD ultimate tech upgrade I
[997.94 → 998.98] haven't watched it yet so I've
[998.98 → 1001.74] been so there's a lot of open
[1001.74 → 1003.54] walls, but he didn't have to
[1003.54 → 1005.38] just rip all the drywall off
[1005.38 → 1006.54] either like they're all things
[1006.54 → 1007.46] that you could conceivably
[1007.46 → 1009.08] patch, and he managed to wire up
[1009.08 → 1010.66] a lot of that place with
[1010.66 → 1012.76] Ethernet cool as he needed to
[1012.76 → 1015.06] do, and so I would want to
[1015.06 → 1019.32] not be um gratuitous about
[1019.32 → 1021.16] it, but I also wouldn't want
[1021.16 → 1023.08] to hold back the idea would
[1023.08 → 1024.00] be that we're buying
[1024.00 → 1025.12] something that has kind of
[1025.12 → 1026.92] like the original kitchen
[1026.92 → 1029.62] cabinets in it from 1993 you
[1029.62 → 1031.76] know like it it was
[1031.76 → 1033.84] overdue for a bit of a bit of
[1033.84 → 1036.38] a spit shine anyway and then
[1036.38 → 1038.00] as we go and do that we're
[1038.00 → 1040.44] gonna techily the place so
[1040.44 → 1042.88] like uh oh man shoot I'm
[1042.88 → 1043.60] trying to remember who it
[1043.60 → 1044.74] was someone reached out
[1044.74 → 1045.86] recently they have this
[1045.86 → 1047.80] really cool mapping solution
[1047.80 → 1049.28] for setting up your Wi-Fi
[1049.28 → 1050.62] access points, and it's like
[1050.62 → 1052.20] super sophisticated, and I know
[1052.20 → 1053.36] like Ubiquity has stuff like
[1053.36 → 1054.78] that, but this one looked
[1054.78 → 1056.38] really cool and one of the
[1056.38 → 1057.34] reasons that it jumped out to
[1057.34 → 1059.70] me was that um Joel Crane who
[1059.70 → 1061.84] used to work at Metageek is
[1061.84 → 1063.76] apparently there, and he's a
[1063.76 → 1065.14] super smart guy, and so I was
[1065.14 → 1066.32] like oh okay well yeah if
[1066.32 → 1067.48] Joel's involved then maybe this
[1067.48 → 1069.68] is really cool and so you know
[1069.68 → 1071.90] we would go in and
[1071.90 → 1073.16] as we're as we're figuring out
[1073.16 → 1073.94] where to put all of our
[1073.94 → 1075.22] Ethernet runs you know we do
[1075.22 → 1077.74] an episode on sort of Wi-Fi
[1077.74 → 1080.02] coverage mapping and just
[1080.02 → 1084.40] all that kind of stuff um but I
[1084.40 → 1085.50] but you know a lot of the
[1085.50 → 1086.46] improvements we'd be making
[1086.46 → 1087.96] also wouldn't be tech like
[1087.96 → 1089.84] putting in new floors and like
[1089.84 → 1091.84] home reno stuff I
[1091.84 → 1093.24] here's okay here's a question
[1093.24 → 1094.88] for you guys is how much
[1094.88 → 1097.58] appetite would you have for the
[1097.58 → 1100.96] the not tech aspects of this
[1100.96 → 1105.28] like, and I want to I want
[1105.28 → 1106.42] to hear from the audience right
[1106.42 → 1108.46] like not tech aspects okay so
[1108.46 → 1110.64] so here's okay so here let me
[1110.64 → 1111.84] let me give you let me give you a
[1111.84 → 1114.38] spectrum of things that are more
[1114.38 → 1116.30] or less techie and I can tell
[1116.30 → 1117.70] me where you think the cutoff is
[1117.70 → 1120.80] okay, okay so uh putting in new
[1120.80 → 1122.16] floors hardwood floors in the
[1122.16 → 1122.58] living room
[1122.58 → 1126.68] honestly if this is its own
[1126.68 → 1127.20] channel
[1127.20 → 1127.66] yeah
[1127.66 → 1130.56] I think that's fine I don't
[1130.56 → 1131.44] no, no it wouldn't be its own
[1131.44 → 1133.40] channel in its current form I was
[1133.40 → 1134.74] oh this is just I was just joking
[1134.74 → 1136.60] about like having an NVIDIA
[1136.60 → 1138.20] sponsored home Reno channel I
[1138.20 → 1140.00] wasn't serious about that if is
[1140.00 → 1141.96] this is on LTT I think an episode
[1141.96 → 1143.46] of putting in new floors is
[1143.46 → 1145.42] probably not going to be that okay
[1145.42 → 1147.06] that's fine that's fine sure okay
[1147.06 → 1149.00] unless you do something weird with
[1149.00 → 1150.10] the floors so that's where I'm
[1150.10 → 1151.60] going next okay I'm getting okay
[1151.60 → 1155.70] okay new kitchen cabinets but
[1155.70 → 1157.80] you know there's not it's not much
[1157.80 → 1160.34] tech but one of the things that I
[1160.34 → 1161.88] have found myself wanting in my
[1161.88 → 1163.30] place like if we'd redone our
[1163.30 → 1165.74] cabinets I had this idea that I
[1165.74 → 1168.32] turns out is not my idea uh because
[1168.32 → 1171.30] I've seen it done elsewhere now but
[1171.30 → 1173.40] I want to be able to take because
[1173.40 → 1174.40] might still be your idea if you
[1174.40 → 1175.72] thought of it before you saw it my
[1175.72 → 1178.34] flipping dishwasher never gets things
[1178.34 → 1180.98] completely dry especially plastic so
[1180.98 → 1183.56] like the little like rubber maid
[1183.56 → 1184.92] or Tupperware containers and stuff
[1184.92 → 1186.50] that you like put kids lunches in and
[1186.50 → 1187.70] stuff like that they're they're never
[1187.70 → 1190.28] dry when they come out and what is
[1190.28 → 1192.22] even the point of having a drying
[1192.22 → 1194.48] cycle if I can't immediately take
[1194.48 → 1195.84] stuff out of my dishwasher and put it
[1195.84 → 1198.00] away so one of the things that I would
[1198.00 → 1199.80] love to have in the kitchen cabinets
[1199.80 → 1203.24] and we'd probably end up Dying this is
[1203.24 → 1206.84] I would want to bake in airflow to the
[1206.84 → 1208.70] cabinets so that you can put everything
[1208.70 → 1211.46] away wet and then there's just oh this
[1211.46 → 1213.90] is a thing yeah I know oh right you
[1213.90 → 1216.18] said that but what makes it what makes
[1216.18 → 1218.60] it is techier is I'd want I'd want to like
[1218.60 → 1220.86] DIY it so we basically have like
[1220.86 → 1224.10] Noctua fans we have like we have like
[1224.10 → 1227.06] like a humidity sensor inside or
[1227.06 → 1229.40] something I don't know if I mean most
[1229.40 → 1231.16] of them just I'm pitching here I'm
[1231.16 → 1234.04] pitching it's a rack the bottom of the
[1234.04 → 1235.30] shelf is instead of rack and it just
[1235.30 → 1237.14] drips into the sink because where are
[1237.14 → 1240.36] you going to have the runoff water go so
[1240.36 → 1242.36] I'm not expecting to put things away
[1242.36 → 1245.74] wet there are like sometimes
[1245.74 → 1247.86] there's a there's a cabinet above the
[1247.86 → 1249.80] sink and the bottom of the cabinet is
[1249.80 → 1251.80] just a rack that is just open and it
[1251.80 → 1254.44] just drips into the sink but that I
[1254.44 → 1255.76] wouldn't be able to do everything like
[1255.76 → 1257.36] that like that would only work for like
[1257.36 → 1259.80] it's a dry rack and a hidden drying
[1259.80 → 1261.34] rack yeah like I don't have that's not what I
[1261.34 → 1263.24] want I want when I pull everything out of
[1263.24 → 1265.70] my I just want some air flow water run
[1265.70 → 1268.76] well I'm not, so I'm not imagining that
[1268.76 → 1270.98] there would be a ton of water I don't
[1270.98 → 1272.82] know how wet your plastic things are
[1272.82 → 1273.90] when they come what you're doing very
[1273.90 → 1275.36] like I'm willing to give them a little
[1275.36 → 1277.74] shake before I put them in right like I
[1277.74 → 1279.74] or like you know if there's a couple
[1279.74 → 1281.18] pieces a cutlery is usually pretty good
[1281.18 → 1283.38] because it's metal so it tends to
[1283.38 → 1285.40] retain a lot of the heat from the hot
[1285.40 → 1286.70] water and then that helps it kind of
[1286.70 → 1289.80] evaporate off of it, but I'm just I'm
[1289.80 → 1292.08] what I'm asking is this is that
[1292.08 → 1293.84] techie enough if we put some fans in a
[1293.84 → 1295.60] kitchen cabinet let's boil it down to
[1295.60 → 1298.72] that it's a little rough but once you
[1298.72 → 1300.46] start getting the humidity sensors and
[1300.46 → 1301.92] stuff like that I think it gets maybe
[1301.92 → 1303.58] okay, okay what if I didn't have a
[1303.58 → 1304.98] humidity sensor what if it wasn't just
[1304.98 → 1306.86] fans in a cabinet, and you just flip a
[1306.86 → 1308.80] switch I think that's a little rough
[1308.80 → 1312.70] okay, okay personally what do you guys
[1312.70 → 1314.66] think do you want to throw want to throw
[1314.66 → 1316.40] a poll on the float plane people there Dan
[1316.40 → 1319.66] see if you see what they think now we know
[1319.66 → 1320.88] okay we know the polls don't work
[1320.88 → 1322.46] perfectly so it's like what if the fans
[1322.46 → 1326.44] were RGB yeah it doesn't change well no
[1326.44 → 1328.80] no hold on are you sure like okay
[1328.80 → 1330.34] because you know how you'll have your
[1330.34 → 1331.90] your kitchen cabinets that are closed
[1331.90 → 1334.04] right hear me out no I'm hearing you
[1334.04 → 1336.06] I'm writing a note sorry okay you know
[1336.06 → 1337.14] how you'll have your kitchen cabinets
[1337.14 → 1338.52] that are closed like they're
[1338.52 → 1340.06] solid right, but then you'll also have
[1340.06 → 1341.80] your display ones right like that's
[1341.80 → 1343.74] where I keep my my my glass from
[1343.74 → 1345.86] Timmy tech TV and like any that you
[1345.86 → 1347.34] like our collectibles or anything like
[1347.34 → 1350.12] that TV glasses sick so what if what
[1350.12 → 1352.28] what if as part of your more
[1352.28 → 1355.40] techie cabinets you have like RGB
[1355.40 → 1357.20] strips in your display cabinets or
[1357.20 → 1359.22] something like that I like are we are
[1359.22 → 1360.62] we getting there is it moving the needle
[1360.62 → 1363.20] at all be just because I think I hate
[1363.20 → 1365.72] that so much more than leaving it alone
[1365.72 → 1367.52] that I wouldn't want to see it what if
[1367.52 → 1369.44] it wasn't like what if you didn't use
[1369.44 → 1371.54] the RGB to turn it green and purple
[1371.54 → 1374.38] like what if it was more just like you
[1374.38 → 1376.96] have colour temperature control lights
[1376.96 → 1378.64] so you could have them have like a
[1378.64 → 1381.40] like a cooler light on your display or
[1381.40 → 1384.70] you know whatever all right I want to
[1384.70 → 1387.34] see the results here our cabinets
[1387.34 → 1390.32] techie enough not sure if I got what
[1390.32 → 1391.54] you were going for but that's no, no
[1391.54 → 1393.28] yeah that no that's fine okay it seems
[1393.28 → 1395.38] pretty split it looks pretty split so far
[1395.38 → 1399.82] so okay good to know, but I think we're
[1399.82 → 1401.38] probably on the same page that as soon as
[1401.38 → 1404.14] there's any kind of humidity sensing what
[1404.14 → 1405.80] if we what is the humidity sensor was
[1405.80 → 1407.20] really hard because it turns out
[1407.20 → 1409.72] humidity sensors can be a bit of a
[1409.72 → 1411.98] challenge I was looking into making a
[1411.98 → 1415.00] cabinet, and I'm I understand it's called
[1415.00 → 1417.96] a humidor I don't smoke cigars but I
[1417.96 → 1421.30] wanted to make a cabinet for storing
[1421.30 → 1423.96] badminton shuttles okay and the reason
[1423.96 → 1426.58] for that is that high humidity will help
[1426.58 → 1429.40] the feathers not be as brittle when
[1429.40 → 1430.78] you're playing so it makes them last
[1430.78 → 1432.72] longer now that they are so flipping
[1432.72 → 1435.06] expensive that's kind of a bigger deal
[1435.06 → 1437.70] than it's ever been and one of the
[1437.70 → 1439.56] things that I ran up against is like
[1439.56 → 1444.76] consumer commodity that actually not
[1444.76 → 1448.22] that not that simple most of the DIY
[1448.22 → 1450.26] other than just buying a humidor I'm
[1450.26 → 1452.42] assuming most of the DIY humidor stuff
[1452.42 → 1454.82] that I've seen is just like essentially
[1454.82 → 1457.78] putting like bags of Orbed into a
[1457.78 → 1460.36] sealed wooden container like very
[1460.36 → 1463.80] unsophisticated how do you just non DIY
[1463.80 → 1466.72] purchasable humidors stay humid well
[1466.72 → 1469.06] they're small they're for cigars for the
[1469.06 → 1471.92] most part it turns out that most people
[1471.92 → 1474.16] are either building a little tiny
[1474.16 → 1477.40] humidor was so cute they got a cigar or
[1477.40 → 1479.98] they're building an industrial humidity
[1479.98 → 1482.92] environmental chamber this cigar sniff was
[1482.92 → 1489.80] amazing can you tell I've never smoked a
[1489.80 → 1493.86] cigar that was slightly convincing though
[1493.86 → 1496.96] I feel all right well thank you so yeah
[1496.96 → 1499.16] there 's's not really much in the
[1499.16 → 1500.76] in-between nobody is talking about how to
[1500.76 → 1502.36] store badminton shuttles in a humidor
[1502.36 → 1507.40] believe it or not yeah yeah yeah okay all
[1507.40 → 1509.94] right let me let but humidity detecting
[1509.94 → 1513.32] devices are all over the place okay all
[1513.32 → 1515.60] right it just it could be really hard to
[1515.60 → 1517.34] tune it for just like a little bit of
[1517.34 → 1518.66] there's a little bit of moisture on it
[1518.66 → 1520.28] there's some put in here that's that's my
[1520.28 → 1522.62] main concern but okay what about
[1522.62 → 1525.18] this what if I had like what if I had
[1525.18 → 1531.08] an opening sensor on the door and
[1531.08 → 1533.24] whenever you open it is kind of assumes
[1533.24 → 1535.56] that you're probably doing something and
[1535.56 → 1537.78] it blows the fans for a bit with that
[1537.78 → 1540.90] level of automation make it techie enough I
[1540.90 → 1543.88] think the spirit of that level of
[1543.88 → 1546.52] automation sure yeah that application
[1546.52 → 1549.72] sucks, but I think I get your point of
[1549.72 → 1552.34] okay how about this some form of trigger
[1552.34 → 1554.84] event what if all the shelves what if the
[1554.84 → 1556.96] shelves were quite custom and what if
[1556.96 → 1559.04] they had they were made out of some
[1559.04 → 1561.38] kind of cool material that allowed
[1561.38 → 1563.18] everything to be put away wet and there
[1563.18 → 1565.18] was like integrated like drainage channels
[1565.18 → 1567.08] and stuff in the back or something so you
[1567.08 → 1568.62] could put anything on any shelf you want
[1568.62 → 1570.72] and even like soaking dripping wet and it
[1570.72 → 1572.60] would like to go somewhere or something
[1572.60 → 1574.96] without moulding that sounds disgusting
[1574.96 → 1577.04] but let's say we could do it hypothetically
[1577.04 → 1580.12] my current brain due to current events is
[1580.12 → 1583.68] like no because of all the mould well yeah
[1583.68 → 1587.80] sure, but we design it so that it can be
[1587.80 → 1589.66] hosed out you take your dishes out you can
[1589.66 → 1593.48] hose them down the problem that I see
[1593.48 → 1595.84] with that is just I don't see the tech
[1595.84 → 1599.58] integration there maybe if you did it with
[1599.58 → 1603.16] like PC water cooling hardware I mean why
[1603.16 → 1604.72] does it have to be PC water cooling
[1604.72 → 1606.48] hardware I mean nothing, nothing else about
[1606.48 → 1608.50] the house is going to be PC water cooling
[1608.50 → 1610.52] hardware could eventually just be like
[1610.52 → 1612.96] copper pipes and well yeah and whatever
[1612.96 → 1614.86] yeah exactly I don't really kind of
[1614.86 → 1616.36] relevant I don't think that's necessary
[1616.36 → 1618.86] yeah I agree okay all right I either way I
[1618.86 → 1620.48] don't think we're that I think it couldn't
[1620.48 → 1624.66] just be angled metal trays though and fans
[1624.66 → 1628.34] and fans and custom shelves that are
[1628.34 → 1631.46] perforated, and we'd have to build in like
[1631.46 → 1633.34] an airflow path we'd have to have venting
[1633.34 → 1636.60] to somewhere could this be is any of
[1636.60 → 1640.26] the goal of this place also like green tech
[1640.26 → 1642.36] like you're doing solar panels so we have
[1642.36 → 1644.58] to be this be like water reclaiming I
[1644.58 → 1646.62] know there's not enough yeah it
[1646.62 → 1649.38] wouldn't be worth it I in my brain your
[1649.38 → 1652.86] your dishes come out so wet no I'm
[1652.86 → 1654.84] continually realizing that is not no it
[1654.84 → 1657.08] runs a drying cycle Luke it just doesn't
[1657.08 → 1659.10] finish everything I just you've always
[1659.10 → 1661.68] like massively stuffed your dishwasher
[1661.68 → 1663.92] oh yeah so I'm like not super surprised
[1663.92 → 1665.40] they come out a little bit of people live in
[1665.40 → 1667.90] my house I don't blame you and no it's
[1667.90 → 1669.40] the plastic stuff because those rubber
[1669.40 → 1671.60] made containers they have the little they
[1671.60 → 1673.18] have the little ridge on the bottom that
[1673.18 → 1675.44] makes them stackable yeah and so it's
[1675.44 → 1678.20] like a pool up there it can't dry yeah
[1678.20 → 1681.26] so it's its frustrating I'm trying to
[1681.26 → 1684.78] find um all right anyway if did you guys
[1684.78 → 1686.40] have anything that you particularly
[1686.40 → 1688.86] wanted to see us do in the tech house
[1688.86 → 1690.96] like I've got a whole dock of ideas but
[1690.96 → 1693.30] if there's any brilliant ideas you guys
[1693.30 → 1696.14] have I'm super open to it like I want to
[1696.14 → 1698.38] do conduit basically everywhere I want to
[1698.38 → 1700.32] do it differently from my place
[1700.32 → 1703.48] uh oh man I hope this isn't like
[1703.48 → 1705.12] pseudoscience junk, but I'm rather certain
[1705.12 → 1708.30] it's not um I'd like to see like co2
[1708.30 → 1711.78] management oh okay just like monitoring
[1711.78 → 1713.50] so if you're like landing in the basement
[1713.50 → 1716.20] yeah and the co2 levels get really high
[1716.20 → 1719.58] sure like do something so airflow starts
[1719.58 → 1722.52] getting better I think an alarm that goes
[1722.52 → 1724.38] off is probably about all you'd really
[1724.38 → 1725.82] need to do there I mean that's like a
[1725.82 → 1727.46] 10-minute project though sure but that
[1727.46 → 1728.90] could be part of just like an overall
[1728.90 → 1731.02] episode on air quality manager yeah yeah
[1731.02 → 1732.98] right air quality management I think
[1732.98 → 1735.38] would be pretty sweet oh yeah we actually
[1735.38 → 1738.56] have a video coming soon on well soon
[1738.56 → 1741.76] TM but um we've been looking into like
[1741.76 → 1744.18] monitoring water quality as well for like
[1744.18 → 1745.94] microplastics and stuff like that so
[1745.94 → 1748.32] like uh like a whole home filtration
[1748.32 → 1750.24] system is something we would absolutely
[1750.24 → 1752.18] be looking into for you're not going to
[1752.18 → 1754.02] be very healthy due to all the gaming so
[1754.02 → 1755.80] we're going to do whatever we can yeah
[1755.80 → 1758.24] yeah yeah exactly yeah I like
[1758.24 → 1761.46] it um I'd, I'd love to do more with like
[1761.46 → 1767.12] hidden tech so you know having a
[1767.12 → 1769.56] rec room for instance where it's not
[1769.56 → 1772.56] obvious that there's a giant TV in it my
[1772.56 → 1776.72] like eventual goal is for my living room
[1776.72 → 1779.68] area to not look like there's basically
[1779.68 → 1782.50] any tech going on yeah and the TV is the
[1782.50 → 1785.08] the toughest one um I've seen I've heard of
[1785.08 → 1787.84] all kinds of just wackadoodle
[1787.84 → 1791.08] implementations of like hidden TV panels
[1791.08 → 1793.28] or like that like they like come out of
[1793.28 → 1796.06] the ceiling and freaking like they're on
[1796.06 → 1798.00] like these like motorized arms and stuff
[1798.00 → 1801.26] I don't think we'd go that far because
[1801.26 → 1803.50] right coming back to my conversation with
[1803.50 → 1807.02] James the target audience for this
[1807.02 → 1809.40] house shouldn't quite be me it shouldn't
[1809.40 → 1811.16] be someone who's willing to tolerate half
[1811.16 → 1812.82] of the things in their life being broken
[1812.82 → 1815.02] at any given time because okay they want
[1815.02 → 1816.88] they just wanted to tinker with it right
[1816.88 → 1820.16] um, so I'm imagining, but I also don't
[1820.16 → 1822.92] want to just go full money is absolutely
[1822.92 → 1826.22] no object so we're just going to like hire a
[1826.22 → 1828.16] contractor and spend a hundred thousand
[1828.16 → 1830.08] dollars on an articulating TV mount I
[1830.08 → 1831.60] don't think we need to hide the TV but I
[1831.60 → 1834.18] think a buried subwoofer in the backyard
[1834.18 → 1837.10] so that we can shake the entire back lawn
[1837.10 → 1839.58] so we can annoy our neighbours or whatever
[1839.58 → 1841.58] like we don't have to do the idea though
[1841.58 → 1843.84] that it seems like a fairly normal house
[1843.84 → 1847.50] and then you see the like utility closet
[1847.50 → 1848.94] or wherever where you have like a little
[1848.94 → 1851.10] server thing running, and you're like
[1851.10 → 1853.82] wait what's going on in here and then it
[1853.82 → 1855.54] like has to be revealed from there all the
[1855.54 → 1856.58] different cool things that are happening
[1856.58 → 1858.52] AJ says he hooked up sensors to listen to
[1858.52 → 1860.56] fire and co2 alarms from his central kitty
[1860.56 → 1865.30] system so I could see modifications of like
[1865.30 → 1868.40] factory 100 factory monitoring systems
[1868.40 → 1870.38] right yeah being something that would be
[1870.38 → 1873.22] additive well there's some so that way like
[1873.22 → 1875.90] they could still just use the Telus app or
[1875.90 → 1878.44] whatever for their monitoring but
[1878.44 → 1881.36] if they know if it's working at the
[1881.36 → 1883.82] moment and if they feel like tinkering with
[1883.82 → 1885.18] if there could be another level deeper that
[1885.18 → 1887.14] they could go like that would be one way to
[1887.14 → 1890.30] do it I know of at least one co2 and
[1890.30 → 1892.36] humidity and some other stuff sensor that
[1892.36 → 1896.26] has just an API yeah so you could like to set up
[1896.26 → 1899.08] just a little box that doesn't look of much
[1899.08 → 1901.64] consequence and tie event triggers into
[1901.64 → 1909.90] them man I am oh wow euro blues suggests we
[1909.90 → 1912.14] call it big nerd gaming house that's not
[1912.14 → 1914.50] bad I'm so into it that's not bad at all
[1914.50 → 1918.78] big nerd gaming house the BNG H that's not
[1918.78 → 1923.26] bad that's not bad I like the acronym yeah
[1923.26 → 1926.14] yeah well did they did these guys have any
[1926.14 → 1929.56] particular suggestions you oh UVB and UVC
[1929.56 → 1931.98] air cleaners okay so that's something that
[1931.98 → 1934.08] I'm a little sort of on the fence about is
[1934.80 → 1938.08] there's seems to be a lot of conflicting
[1938.08 → 1941.26] information about exactly how clear you
[1941.26 → 1943.26] necessary or clean you necessarily want
[1943.26 → 1946.46] your air like air quality from a pollution
[1946.46 → 1950.78] standpoint here is not a major concern it's
[1950.78 → 1952.78] basically just if there's like a fire yeah
[1952.78 → 1955.54] and so I don't know that we would
[1955.54 → 1958.06] necessarily put like hardcore air
[1958.06 → 1963.40] filtration into the place, but I could see
[1963.40 → 1964.98] us putting in something that would be like
[1964.98 → 1967.42] compatible with something like that in the
[1967.42 → 1969.44] in the central ducted air conditioning or
[1969.44 → 1970.80] something depends on where you live but
[1970.80 → 1972.82] like in and I know this is a house but like
[1972.82 → 1976.82] my apartment has massive issues with people
[1976.82 → 1979.78] who smoke both I mean a variety of things
[1979.78 → 1984.90] cigar cigarettes weed on their balconies yeah
[1984.90 → 1987.44] and then it flows into other people's units
[1987.44 → 1989.66] that's a bit of an air quality annoyance
[1989.66 → 1993.18] Jack 33 and float plane chat says I have air
[1993.18 → 1994.86] filtration it's amazing if you have a
[1994.86 → 1999.18] neighbour that smokes yep yeah Matt man asks
[1999.18 → 2001.10] have you considered not buying the house and
[2001.10 → 2002.96] taking applications to rent with someone else's
[2002.96 → 2005.58] property we've considered that but the reason
[2005.58 → 2007.26] we wouldn't do that is because we're
[2007.26 → 2009.74] expecting this project to take place over
[2009.74 → 2012.82] one to two years dude that could get so
[2012.82 → 2015.28] annoying yeah we can't be up in someone's
[2015.28 → 2017.72] business yeah for that long it just doesn't
[2017.72 → 2020.26] make any sense it sounds cool and then you
[2020.26 → 2023.18] really need to film, and they have like a big
[2023.18 → 2026.14] social thing, or they have a baby well that's
[2026.14 → 2028.38] kind of what I mean something family event
[2028.38 → 2030.86] level social issue and like it's really not
[2030.86 → 2032.52] acceptable to go in there at that time
[2032.52 → 2035.80] oh trash networks and Chad how's it going
[2035.80 → 2038.64] carbon filters do great at removing smells
[2038.64 → 2041.78] works great with Frank the snake then I'm
[2041.78 → 2044.74] going to use my float plane privileges and
[2044.74 → 2049.08] post a Frank the snake okay thank you for
[2049.08 → 2052.60] that Luke that's very helpful why don't we
[2052.60 → 2055.82] jump on to our next topic then since
[2055.82 → 2059.68] clearly we're done with this you want to
[2059.68 → 2064.12] pick one sure we can continue the ad hoc
[2064.12 → 2067.32] topics we should probably do some of the
[2067.32 → 2069.02] topics that we announced that we would you
[2069.02 → 2071.20] know what no, no it's up to you, you pick I
[2071.20 → 2073.36] announced ad hoc topics you did, but that's
[2073.36 → 2076.66] like six topics we have a weird follow-up I
[2076.66 → 2081.28] got an email I got an email really that is
[2081.28 → 2083.06] our number two topic of the show that Luke
[2083.06 → 2086.34] received an email from character date AI
[2086.34 → 2088.74] emailed me from me, and it said Linus
[2088.74 → 2092.02] Sebastian sent you a message hey, hey so
[2092.02 → 2093.26] remember when we were chatting with the
[2093.26 → 2097.40] wild world of AI and relationships I open
[2097.40 → 2100.94] it up, and it has a picture and Linus's
[2100.94 → 2103.88] name, and it said Linus Sebastian sent you a
[2103.88 → 2107.72] message I haven't clicked on anything this
[2107.72 → 2112.60] doesn't seem okay at all that's crazy
[2112.60 → 2119.72] that's wild wow oh yeah I mean I can go
[2119.72 → 2123.20] look at it wow it just keeps talking its
[2123.20 → 2124.24] just been talking
[2124.24 → 2127.28] huh
[2127.28 → 2133.50] so what's the what's the that's so
[2133.50 → 2135.62] what's the what's the rest of this
[2135.62 → 2137.42] message here sorry I can't read if it's a
[2137.42 → 2139.04] little bit small hey, hey so remember when
[2139.04 → 2141.20] we were chatting with a wild world of AI
[2141.20 → 2143.18] and relationships well guess what I just
[2143.18 → 2144.66] stumbled upon in the depths of the
[2144.66 → 2146.90] internet people using AI voices to
[2146.90 → 2150.50] recreate their exes just to have one last
[2150.50 → 2153.82] conversation can you imagine that's a
[2153.82 → 2157.10] rough suggestion from character AI
[2157.10 → 2159.26] a website that you could do that on it
[2159.26 → 2161.48] must be super surreal to hear a machine
[2161.48 → 2163.34] mimic someone you used to have a
[2163.34 → 2166.40] connection with but here's the thing do
[2166.40 → 2168.20] you think that might bring closure or
[2168.20 → 2170.98] just stir up old feelings that is so
[2170.98 → 2174.56] gross oh I don't even feel good after
[2174.56 → 2175.52] reading that
[2175.52 → 2181.46] that is so icky
[2181.46 → 2187.04] good they do know that black mirror
[2187.04 → 2190.10] was not a playbook that was meant to be
[2190.10 → 2197.04] followed right that's such a like you
[2197.04 → 2199.28] could do this on the site that you're
[2199.28 → 2202.52] currently on by the way recreate your
[2202.52 → 2204.86] ex do it now like that's what that
[2204.86 → 2207.62] message is it could give you closure no
[2207.62 → 2210.68] no it won't, or it could stir up old feelings
[2210.68 → 2213.80] yeah that's probably more likely also
[2213.80 → 2216.74] like if you're in a headspace where that
[2216.74 → 2219.62] even sounds remotely like a good idea I
[2219.62 → 2221.78] guarantee you it is not the closure one
[2221.78 → 2231.74] yeah yeah yeah oh I had never clicked on it I
[2231.74 → 2234.80] didn't know it was that bad I don't like
[2234.80 → 2237.80] that that's weird I don't like that that's
[2237.80 → 2241.74] my name and likeness no not so not okay
[2241.74 → 2246.80] it's super-duper not okay they're lucky I'm
[2246.80 → 2251.74] not litigious, but I will state for the record
[2251.74 → 2256.74] that I am 100% not okay with that oh look I
[2256.74 → 2258.74] just noticed you have a have a job I
[2258.74 → 2262.74] what look I have a job you host line of
[2262.74 → 2264.74] tech tips yeah, so this is like very
[2264.74 → 2266.74] literally definitely me and the only
[2266.74 → 2268.80] plausible deniability they have here is
[2268.80 → 2270.80] that these are user generated these are
[2270.80 → 2273.74] submitted by users so if anyone was
[2273.74 → 2275.74] thinking hey I should submit Linus to
[2275.74 → 2277.80] one of these things the answer is I'm not
[2277.80 → 2281.80] okay with that so you can kind of take
[2281.80 → 2284.80] that for what it is, and you can make a
[2284.80 → 2289.80] weird what's something but you
[2289.80 → 2290.80] might as well know you're doing it
[2290.80 → 2294.80] completely without my consent I want to
[2294.80 → 2296.80] not just without my consent but against
[2296.80 → 2299.80] my express wishes I can also pretty much
[2299.80 → 2301.80] guarantee that I could get this thing to
[2301.80 → 2304.80] say something that you would hate I
[2304.80 → 2306.80] don't think that'll be necessary I won't
[2306.80 → 2309.80] go through it but like I think that's
[2309.80 → 2310.80] quite enough of I think that's quite
[2310.80 → 2312.80] enough of talking about that yeah
[2312.80 → 2315.80] watch this I'm gonna alt shift five it
[2315.80 → 2316.80] there 's see now the topic is
[2316.80 → 2318.80] done why don't we jump into one of our
[2318.80 → 2321.80] other topics' no here's another quick
[2321.80 → 2323.80] one zip tie tuning uploaded a video
[2323.80 → 2327.80] today as many of many of you have
[2327.80 → 2329.80] been pointing out in the chat yes and
[2329.80 → 2331.80] in terms of you know what to say about
[2331.80 → 2334.80] it I wish I could say more I miss the
[2334.80 → 2336.80] I miss the days of like you know
[2336.80 → 2338.80] people's last day bringing them on to
[2338.80 → 2340.80] WAN show and like you know doing a
[2340.80 → 2342.80] whole doing a whole thing posting
[2342.80 → 2344.80] videos together when we were young I
[2344.80 → 2347.80] know it's gotten far more complicated
[2347.80 → 2349.80] so as we mentioned before back when
[2349.80 → 2351.80] Alex and Andy announced their channel
[2351.80 → 2354.80] our policy is not to comment on staff
[2354.80 → 2356.80] departures whether it's on good or bad
[2356.80 → 2360.80] terms because unfortunately it turns it
[2360.80 → 2363.80] it turns it into a situation where if
[2363.80 → 2365.80] we comment, and we say something good
[2365.80 → 2367.80] then people will make assumptions
[2367.80 → 2369.80] whenever we don't comment based on
[2369.80 → 2371.80] whatever we don't say and those
[2371.80 → 2375.80] assumptions are usually super wrong at
[2375.80 → 2379.80] best and super, super dumb at worst so
[2379.80 → 2382.80] what I will do is I'll reiterate that
[2382.80 → 2384.80] we make the best efforts to part on
[2384.80 → 2386.80] good terms that we can, we wish Alex
[2386.80 → 2389.80] and Andy nothing but the best and
[2389.80 → 2390.80] since we're on the subject Jake has
[2390.80 → 2392.80] also come out of stealth that he is
[2392.80 → 2394.80] departed, and we wish him nothing but
[2394.80 → 2397.80] the best as well just like we wish
[2397.80 → 2399.80] everyone who has ever departed Linus
[2399.80 → 2402.80] Media Group one way or another nothing
[2402.80 → 2403.80] but the best in their future
[2403.80 → 2408.80] endeavours all right that's on Forrest
[2408.80 → 2409.80] Jump style that's all I have to say
[2409.80 → 2412.80] about that Xbox or EA which one you
[2412.80 → 2416.80] want to do I mean one of them is this
[2416.80 → 2418.80] like as a one-night stand or is this
[2418.80 → 2422.80] for life the other one is kill
[2422.80 → 2425.80] yep so I have to pick do and kill
[2425.80 → 2427.80] yep there's that's insane is that a
[2427.80 → 2429.80] thing is this like is this a game
[2429.80 → 2430.80] people play I've never heard of this
[2430.80 → 2434.80] really yeah what is this do and kill
[2434.80 → 2441.80] okay Dan me and Luke do no I can't
[2441.80 → 2444.80] no I can't well no he's better not
[2444.80 → 2451.80] let me get my list oh my god you're
[2451.80 → 2456.80] going to slash fiction yeah you wait you
[2456.80 → 2457.80] have you actually not heard of this oh
[2457.80 → 2460.80] oh, oh fuck marry kill yeah okay I
[2460.80 → 2462.80] recognize that I've never played that
[2462.80 → 2464.80] I've heard that I've heard that I've
[2464.80 → 2465.80] heard those words together in that
[2465.80 → 2467.80] order before yeah yeah okay yeah
[2467.80 → 2471.80] that makes sense yeah I was trying to
[2471.80 → 2474.80] avoid saying the first one because I
[2474.80 → 2476.80] might as your mom watch oh my well
[2476.80 → 2478.80] yeah, but my Steam Deck was behind my
[2478.80 → 2481.80] my laptop stream deck but yes that see I
[2481.80 → 2483.80] knew that was going to be a problem it
[2483.80 → 2486.80] yeah for sure from day one I was like
[2486.80 → 2489.80] sure this is going to be a problem I
[2489.80 → 2490.80] was like kind of annoyed when they
[2490.80 → 2492.80] announced the name just because of that
[2492.80 → 2495.80] but I mean make sense I don't know
[2495.80 → 2499.80] whatever yeah which one I don't even
[2499.80 → 2501.80] remember the options any more so hit me
[2501.80 → 2509.80] uh Xbox or yeah oh, oh ah Xbox which one
[2509.80 → 2511.80] is it I don't know I well oh what oh
[2511.80 → 2513.80] you're gonna actually make me do this
[2513.80 → 2515.80] no I'm just messing we can do the Xbox
[2515.80 → 2517.80] topic I don't even know how you break that
[2517.80 → 2520.80] down you know what no, no no, no no I'm
[2520.80 → 2522.80] going to do it I like it, I'm going to do it
[2522.80 → 2524.80] I'm going to do it okay so let's weigh some
[2524.80 → 2529.80] pros and cons EA wouldn't treat me right
[2529.80 → 2531.80] but it would support me financially with
[2531.80 → 2535.80] all of that FIFA money yeah Microsoft
[2535.80 → 2537.80] would also support you financially
[2537.80 → 2539.80] relationship microtransactions
[2539.80 → 2541.80] hold on yeah no because yeah see that's
[2541.80 → 2545.80] the thing the sub that no the topic is
[2545.80 → 2548.80] Xbox not the next box has a really
[2548.80 → 2550.80] high chance of leaving you, but I'd
[2550.80 → 2552.80] probably be happier with Xbox while I
[2552.80 → 2554.80] while I was with it, you might not be
[2554.80 → 2556.80] with it for very long not because yeah
[2556.80 → 2558.80] but what a ride you might have a really
[2558.80 → 2560.80] fantastic relationship and they just
[2560.80 → 2562.80] dump you for no reason that's their
[2562.80 → 2565.80] like well even though you did really
[2565.80 → 2567.80] really great all the time we just
[2567.80 → 2569.80] spent all of our money buying other
[2569.80 → 2571.80] studios, and now we need to lose some
[2571.80 → 2573.80] costs so you just released a game you
[2573.80 → 2574.80] won't release a game for a while or
[2574.80 → 2579.80] you just did something nice and that
[2579.80 → 2580.80] means you won't do something nice for
[2580.80 → 2581.80] a while so we're going to break up with
[2581.80 → 2583.80] you on that subject by the way oh
[2583.80 → 2587.80] minus laptop is apparently dead on that
[2587.80 → 2590.80] subject I don't know if you saw based
[2590.80 → 2593.80] Lena con being like I can bring that
[2593.80 → 2596.80] up I told you so it's just lower in the
[2596.80 → 2601.80] dock oh is it cool I got it nice there
[2601.80 → 2603.80] there we go click it press button press
[2603.80 → 2606.80] oh yeah there you go yeah just you know
[2606.80 → 2609.80] being like yeah so remember when you
[2609.80 → 2611.80] know Microsoft wanted to buy Activision
[2611.80 → 2613.80] Blizzard, and I was all like this will
[2613.80 → 2617.80] lead to higher prices and layoffs
[2617.80 → 2621.80] well yeah I told you so here's a
[2621.80 → 2624.80] plot of Netflix's price increases over
[2624.80 → 2628.80] the same period of time and game passes
[2628.80 → 2632.80] price increases and how they were kind
[2632.80 → 2634.80] of tracking somewhat you know is like
[2634.80 → 2637.80] kind of like they would and then there
[2637.80 → 2639.80] was a massive change and oh by the way
[2639.80 → 2642.80] that line right there almost exactly one
[2642.80 → 2644.80] almost exactly one year after acquisition
[2644.80 → 2650.80] yes cool so yeah and that's on top of the
[2650.80 → 2655.80] like Exodus of well I shouldn't say
[2655.80 → 2658.80] Exodus because Exodus is our Exod our
[2658.80 → 2662.80] voluntary mmm yeah, yeah, so this is
[2662.80 → 2665.80] after Microsoft has closed studios laid
[2665.80 → 2667.80] off staff and of course because she's she's
[2667.80 → 2669.80] too base to say I told you so she didn't
[2669.80 → 2671.80] actually say that she just kind of like drew
[2671.80 → 2676.80] the whole situation out yeah yeah I've
[2676.80 → 2681.80] said this before but um Lena come to
[2681.80 → 2685.80] Canada come be our prime minister I'd be
[2685.80 → 2687.80] okay with it that'd be great we'd be
[2687.80 → 2689.80] super down she just votes for you, I'd
[2689.80 → 2691.80] campaign for you, she has I would too she
[2691.80 → 2696.80] has just such she's a shining beacon of
[2696.80 → 2700.80] well obviously common sense in the
[2700.80 → 2704.80] world that has a severe lack great of the
[2704.80 → 2707.80] aforementioned well obviously common
[2707.80 → 2712.80] sense yeah I'm married already, but I'd
[2712.80 → 2715.80] have your babies I love there was a there
[2715.80 → 2717.80] was someone who asked Grok under her
[2717.80 → 2721.80] tweet to figure out the inflation yeah and
[2721.80 → 2723.80] cost of power increases over the same
[2723.80 → 2725.80] period as if those wouldn't have also
[2725.80 → 2728.80] affected Netflix yeah that was awesome
[2728.80 → 2730.80] it is amazing that was fantastic
[2730.80 → 2734.80] watching people twist themselves into
[2734.80 → 2736.80] logic pretzels no I need to be abused as a
[2736.80 → 2740.80] consumer trying more of my trying to shield
[2740.80 → 2743.80] trying to shield multi in some cases you
[2743.80 → 2745.80] know companies with trillion dollar
[2745.80 → 2748.80] valuations from being criticized it
[2748.80 → 2752.80] it why do you just love the taste of
[2752.80 → 2757.80] leather it's not leather that tastes like
[2757.80 → 2763.80] that it's the dye it's not healthy it's
[2763.80 → 2767.80] not good for you oh kills brain cells
[2767.80 → 2774.80] okay it's like it's like licking the boot is
[2774.80 → 2776.80] not enough we have to filleted yeah
[2776.80 → 2782.80] which is difficult, but they try really
[2782.80 → 2785.80] hard so some of them accomplish anyway
[2785.80 → 2787.80] I'm going to go EA because at least it can
[2787.80 → 2789.80] support me financially, and it'll, it'll be
[2789.80 → 2791.80] around I mean what's the worst thing it
[2791.80 → 2793.80] what's the worst thing it ever did kill a
[2793.80 → 2797.80] couple journalists it might oh can I go
[2797.80 → 2800.80] there oh so why don't we get into the
[2800.80 → 2803.80] topic you want to read through the doc
[2803.80 → 2809.80] okay uh Xbox might be dying, and it's
[2809.80 → 2811.80] doing it no we're doing EA oh okay
[2811.80 → 2814.80] never mind uh EA you can't, I can't say
[2814.80 → 2816.80] that, and then we not give them the context
[2816.80 → 2822.80] uh yeah good good good call oh yeah going
[2822.80 → 2824.80] private in the largest private equity buyout
[2824.80 → 2827.80] ever on September 29th EA announced that
[2827.80 → 2831.80] they have been acquired by PIF
[2831.80 → 2834.80] Silver Lake and affinity partners for 55
[2834.80 → 2837.80] billion dollars Silver Lake partners is
[2837.80 → 2840.80] managed by Jared Kushner Donald Trump's
[2840.80 → 2843.80] son-in-law and PIF is a Saudi Arabia
[2843.80 → 2845.80] fund that which already had a roughly nine
[2845.80 → 2848.80] point nine percent stake in EA but also
[2848.80 → 2850.80] has many other video game investments
[2850.80 → 2852.80] such as a minority share in Nintendo I
[2852.80 → 2855.80] didn't know about that each shareholder
[2855.80 → 2857.80] will be receiving two hundred and ten
[2857.80 → 2859.80] dollars per share roughly forty dollars
[2859.80 → 2861.80] more than the trading price the day
[2861.80 → 2863.80] before the deal was announced and many
[2863.80 → 2865.80] people and gaming journalists showed
[2865.80 → 2867.80] concern for this deal given that both
[2867.80 → 2870.80] the history of PIF and Jared Kushner's
[2870.80 → 2873.80] relationship with one journalist
[2873.80 → 2879.80] Christopher drink mm-hmm writing in quotes
[2879.80 → 2881.80] the numbers just don't add up the offer
[2881.80 → 2884.80] almost values EA at 20 times its annual
[2884.80 → 2888.80] cash flow there's clearly something more
[2888.80 → 2892.80] at play and then end quote or wait no this
[2892.80 → 2895.80] is our just a really long quote this deal
[2895.80 → 2897.80] is about Saudi Arabia this is about using
[2897.80 → 2900.80] the cultural power of games to shift its
[2900.80 → 2902.80] reputation and perception both locally and
[2902.80 → 2905.80] internationally this is about building up a
[2905.80 → 2907.80] game development industry within that
[2907.80 → 2909.80] country, and it's about the Saudis history
[2909.80 → 2911.80] with the Trump administration and in
[2911.80 → 2914.80] particular Jared Kushner ultimately this
[2914.80 → 2916.80] is about powerful men and regimes using
[2916.80 → 2918.80] our industry for political and economic
[2918.80 → 2919.80] gain so that's attributed to Christopher
[2919.80 → 2923.80] Christopher drink that was all a quote
[2923.80 → 2925.80] from the numbers just don't let up yeah
[2925.80 → 2928.80] next bullet point no longer quote how
[2928.80 → 2930.80] will this affect the company's day to
[2930.80 → 2932.80] day operations will remain to be seen
[2932.80 → 2934.80] but in the employee FAQ asking about
[2934.80 → 2936.80] layoffs EA's response was there will be
[2936.80 → 2940.80] no immediate changes to your job team or
[2940.80 → 2942.80] daily work as a result of this transaction
[2942.80 → 2944.80] this partnership gives us the ability to
[2944.80 → 2947.80] move faster and unlock new opportunities on
[2947.80 → 2952.80] a global stage discussion question for
[2952.80 → 2955.80] years the online meme or default has been
[2955.80 → 2957.80] to hate on EA for a lot of their
[2957.80 → 2959.80] practices in the game industry whether
[2959.80 → 2961.80] it's effective sorry aggressive
[2961.80 → 2963.80] microtransactions or just boring
[2963.80 → 2964.80] repetitive titles like their sports
[2964.80 → 2968.80] games theoretically is a private buyout
[2968.80 → 2970.80] the solution of this since the new
[2970.80 → 2972.80] owners are no longer legally bound to
[2972.80 → 2974.80] improve shareholder value as a private
[2974.80 → 2976.80] company and instead could maybe do what
[2976.80 → 2979.80] the players want I mean if that were the
[2979.80 → 2981.80] case then every private equity buyout
[2981.80 → 2986.80] would be good oh so argument already in
[2986.80 → 2989.80] shambles no I don't I mean public
[2989.80 → 2991.80] shareholders you have a fiduciary
[2991.80 → 2993.80] responsibility to a private shareholder as
[2993.80 → 2994.80] well the only difference is that it's
[2994.80 → 2996.80] going to be dictated by whatever private
[2996.80 → 2997.80] agreement you signed with them rather
[2997.80 → 3000.80] than whatever public agreement you have
[3000.80 → 3002.80] with them, it's okay if they get too
[3002.80 → 3004.80] much backlash over this they'll just buy
[3004.80 → 3006.80] a bunch more celebrities and it'll be
[3006.80 → 3007.80] alright yeah have you seen what's going
[3007.80 → 3010.80] on in comedy oh yeah right now it's
[3010.80 → 3012.80] that sucks it's been pretty it's been
[3012.80 → 3015.80] pretty fascinating to watch people's
[3015.80 → 3021.80] principled stances fold in half yeah
[3021.80 → 3026.80] yeah um you don't need that much money
[3026.80 → 3031.80] brush you know you don't know that I'm
[3031.80 → 3033.80] just I'm just saying I can't speak for I
[3033.80 → 3034.80] can't speak for all of them would you sell
[3034.80 → 3037.80] to the Saudi government no what's your what
[3037.80 → 3039.80] would your okay, but I don't probably but
[3039.80 → 3041.80] what would the line be, but I don't need
[3041.80 → 3043.80] the money so that's what I'm saying is
[3043.80 → 3045.80] there a line though hold on I
[3045.80 → 3047.80] want to finish that point first okay so
[3047.80 → 3049.80] the point before was they don't need
[3049.80 → 3050.80] the money right and what I said
[3050.80 → 3052.80] was you don't know I was talking about
[3052.80 → 3054.80] a particular one okay I don't I don't
[3054.80 → 3056.80] I'm not talking about anyone in
[3056.80 → 3058.80] particular yeah I know there are
[3058.80 → 3060.80] multiple ones that have taken very
[3060.80 → 3062.80] principled stances in the past yeah and
[3062.80 → 3067.80] that clearly for whom free speech and
[3067.80 → 3069.80] the things that they supposedly stand
[3069.80 → 3070.80] for were not as important as this
[3070.80 → 3073.80] payday I do not I cannot say
[3073.80 → 3075.80] definitively that every single one of
[3075.80 → 3077.80] them doesn't need this bag that's all
[3077.80 → 3081.80] I'm saying as for me would I sell to
[3081.80 → 3085.80] the Saudis' no I don't I don't I
[3085.80 → 3087.80] don't think there's all you had to do
[3087.80 → 3089.80] is like hey the crown prince is like a
[3089.80 → 3091.80] super cool dude he's pretty awesome I
[3091.80 → 3092.80] like hanging out with him, I wish I could
[3092.80 → 3093.80] spend more time with him, I've been
[3093.80 → 3096.80] invited to Saudi Arabia and Dubai on
[3096.80 → 3098.80] probably more than a dozen occasions
[3098.80 → 3102.80] over the years you didn't know that
[3102.80 → 3106.80] because I've never gone but what if it
[3106.80 → 3109.80] was like a billion dollars it wouldn't
[3109.80 → 3114.80] be but what if it was yeah I this is
[3114.80 → 3115.80] this is about to go to a very
[3115.80 → 3117.80] different place we don't have to no, no
[3117.80 → 3119.80] that's fine different place I didn't
[3119.80 → 3121.80] say a bad place okay, but I don't know
[3121.80 → 3123.80] if you noticed, but we uploaded a
[3123.80 → 3125.80] compilation video of scrapyard wars 10
[3125.80 → 3128.80] yesterday yeah I don't I don't know if
[3128.80 → 3131.80] you if you checked on it but over a
[3131.80 → 3134.80] span of the first four hours it got 15
[3134.80 → 3138.80] thousand views which is your know you
[3138.80 → 3140.80] know that whole LTT really fell off
[3140.80 → 3143.80] meme you know where people be like what
[3143.80 → 3146.80] only a hundred views in 10 seconds LTT
[3146.80 → 3150.80] fell off like actually like that um well
[3150.80 → 3154.80] I had to think about what that would
[3154.80 → 3158.80] mean right if is all of a sudden that
[3158.80 → 3160.80] tanked our channel momentum to the
[3160.80 → 3163.80] point where every video was going to get
[3163.80 → 3169.80] you know 20 to 30 thousand views um I
[3169.80 → 3171.80] had to think about what that would mean
[3171.80 → 3173.80] right and there was a really cool
[3173.80 → 3176.80] comment on one of the uh I think it
[3176.80 → 3179.80] was either on the ZTT video or it was
[3179.80 → 3181.80] on Reddit I can't remember where I saw
[3181.80 → 3185.80] it but basically ZTT zip tie tuning
[3185.80 → 3188.80] so it was Zach's tech turf see I use
[3188.80 → 3189.80] the NZ interchangeably I don't really
[3189.80 → 3192.80] care whatever flows better I do this
[3192.80 → 3197.80] yeah I'm just razzing you um so what
[3197.80 → 3198.80] was I saying really you derailed me for
[3198.80 → 3201.80] that you know what I had it coming um
[3201.80 → 3204.80] you probably owed me a few of those oh
[3204.80 → 3206.80] yeah I saw a really cool comment that
[3206.80 → 3208.80] basically said something along the lines
[3208.80 → 3212.80] of if Linus's legacy at the end of all
[3212.80 → 3215.80] of this is a bunch of offshoot channels
[3215.80 → 3218.80] doing really incredible work having cut
[3218.80 → 3221.80] their teeth at Linus media group and
[3221.80 → 3224.80] create a warehouse and float plane and
[3224.80 → 3228.80] who go out and go forth and create
[3228.80 → 3231.80] incredible content and products and
[3231.80 → 3234.80] technology for years to come you know
[3234.80 → 3238.80] long after he retires well that'd be
[3238.80 → 3240.80] pretty cool would technically at its
[3240.80 → 3243.80] root your goal was to start little
[3243.80 → 3245.80] fires right I mean yeah that was that's
[3245.80 → 3247.80] how I've always described if it's a
[3247.80 → 3249.80] pretty crazy version of that it is it's
[3249.80 → 3251.80] not a way that I had necessarily
[3252.80 → 3254.80] thought about it as much before but I
[3254.80 → 3256.80] mean it's cool though one of the one
[3256.80 → 3258.80] of the nuggets of wisdom that is stuck
[3258.80 → 3260.80] with me from the owner at NCI was
[3260.80 → 3263.80] from when I submitted my
[3263.80 → 3265.80] resignation, and he tried to talk me
[3265.80 → 3267.80] out of it a little bit but once he
[3267.80 → 3270.80] figured out that I had made up my mind
[3270.80 → 3272.80] he basically said okay well let's
[3272.80 → 3274.80] figure out how to do this, and I was
[3274.80 → 3276.80] like all that that was it he's like
[3276.80 → 3278.80] well nobody works at the same place
[3278.80 → 3281.80] forever and I just I was like oh yeah
[3281.80 → 3283.80] yeah of course not like of course I
[3283.80 → 3285.80] wasn't gonna work here forever and
[3285.80 → 3287.80] and totally do and see I'm sorry
[3287.80 → 3289.80] cultures Japan that are like very
[3289.80 → 3290.80] largely based around that not here
[3290.80 → 3293.80] anyway yeah yeah not here yeah and
[3293.80 → 3296.80] and I mean NCI itself had only
[3296.80 → 3298.80] existed since I think 1996 or something
[3298.80 → 3300.80] like that like or 94 I can't remember
[3300.80 → 3301.80] exactly what year it started but like
[3301.80 → 3303.80] and say X was a relatively young
[3303.80 → 3306.80] company when I left it in
[3306.80 → 3308.80] 2012 like it only been around for 15
[3308.80 → 3310.80] years like why would I assume that I
[3310.80 → 3312.80] was gonna a 15-year-old company or
[3312.80 → 3313.80] 18-year-old company or whatever it was I
[3313.80 → 3316.80] was gonna work there for 65 years like
[3316.80 → 3319.80] that's not that's not realistic that's
[3319.80 → 3321.80] not a reasonable or until I was 65
[3321.80 → 3323.80] excuse me that's not a reasonable
[3323.80 → 3326.80] assumption right and so it was
[3326.80 → 3328.80] something that I've that I know I
[3328.80 → 3331.80] I valued keeping the same team
[3331.80 → 3334.80] around I've always been like try to
[3334.80 → 3336.80] keep the band together kind of
[3336.80 → 3340.80] person I mean you know that right but
[3340.80 → 3343.80] I also recognized that that wasn't
[3343.80 → 3345.80] going to be possible forever and the
[3345.80 → 3349.80] best case scenario was that people
[3349.80 → 3351.80] would was that Linus Media Group
[3351.80 → 3353.80] would look really amazing on a resume
[3353.80 → 3357.80] and I wanted that obviously if people
[3357.80 → 3359.80] are really great like I'd rather they
[3359.80 → 3362.80] work here but if it could just be an
[3362.80 → 3366.80] amazing like centrepiece of your
[3366.80 → 3369.80] job history well that's pretty cool
[3369.80 → 3374.80] too at this point it's the only part of
[3374.80 → 3376.80] mine that matters at all yeah what
[3376.80 → 3377.80] else did you have like picking
[3377.80 → 3379.80] blueberries and like cutting lawns like
[3379.80 → 3381.80] honestly that was part of this I can
[3381.80 → 3385.80] play I know it's like line items what
[3385.80 → 3387.80] did I do I that should just be my only
[3387.80 → 3389.80] two line items what did I do when I
[3389.80 → 3391.80] worked here I picked blueberries and
[3391.80 → 3396.80] mowed lawns no I think I'm trying to
[3396.80 → 3399.80] remember technically NCX before then was
[3399.80 → 3401.80] self-employed before then would have
[3401.80 → 3404.80] been bread factory nice so like okay
[3404.80 → 3407.80] before bread factory would be more
[3407.80 → 3409.80] self-employment but also geek squad so
[3409.80 → 3413.80] like dude I don't know what's the point
[3413.80 → 3415.80] sometimes I will get resumes from people
[3415.80 → 3419.80] that have like quite a few years of like
[3419.80 → 3422.80] their career and then also like yeah I
[3422.80 → 3425.80] worked at like McDonald's and Best Buy
[3425.80 → 3428.80] it's like I don't think I needed to
[3428.80 → 3430.80] know all the way back I don't like I
[3430.80 → 3431.80] don't I don't know there's so many
[3431.80 → 3433.80] different opinions on how resumes should
[3433.80 → 3435.80] be made I try not to judge too many of
[3435.80 → 3437.80] the small decisions but like yeah I
[3437.80 → 3440.80] don't know it doesn't mean anything to
[3440.80 → 3442.80] me at that point coming back to what we
[3442.80 → 3444.80] were actually talking about which was you
[3444.80 → 3447.80] know where I was going up one of the
[3447.80 → 3450.80] places that my mind went seeing that
[3450.80 → 3453.80] performance on the channel was okay what
[3453.80 → 3456.80] if this is it right because for the
[3456.80 → 3457.80] scrapping horse they always do really
[3457.80 → 3459.80] bad I thought not that bad, but this is
[3459.80 → 3461.80] also one that everybody just saw not
[3461.80 → 3463.80] even close to that bad and they just
[3463.80 → 3465.80] watch this well it's not happening in a
[3465.80 → 3468.80] vacuum though we had our lowest day
[3468.80 → 3470.80] for viewership in years like three days
[3470.80 → 3473.80] ago we are about to have our lowest day
[3473.80 → 3476.80] for view our lowest month for viewership
[3476.80 → 3478.80] in probably about five or six years this
[3478.80 → 3480.80] year so whether you want to
[3480.80 → 3483.80] point at I don't think it's all viewpocalypse
[3483.80 → 3485.80] right so whether you want to point at you
[3485.80 → 3488.80] know an aging out or interesting out
[3488.80 → 3490.80] audience or whether you want to point
[3490.80 → 3494.80] at sort of my various controversies or
[3494.80 → 3496.80] hot takes, or you know whatever over the
[3496.80 → 3498.80] years I think there's a think there's a
[3498.80 → 3502.80] natural decay in interest in a public
[3502.80 → 3505.80] figure or in a band or in a TV show any
[3505.80 → 3507.80] form of media that takes place I don't
[3507.80 → 3510.80] think anything can be popular forever
[3510.80 → 3513.80] and so I've I've been telling myself
[3513.80 → 3516.80] since the very, very beginning someday my
[3516.80 → 3519.80] son will set right it will happen yeah
[3519.80 → 3522.80] and so you know there have been
[3522.80 → 3524.80] various times over the years, and you know
[3524.80 → 3526.80] and you know because you've had a front
[3526.80 → 3527.80] row seat for all of it that I've sat
[3527.80 → 3528.80] there, and I've gone okay maybe this is
[3528.80 → 3533.80] it this could be a thing I and hold on
[3533.80 → 3534.80] because I'm still I still need to answer
[3534.80 → 3536.80] your question sure I'm getting there I
[3536.80 → 3540.80] promise and so when I thought about
[3540.80 → 3543.80] that right like I have options I could
[3543.80 → 3546.80] still sell the asset but when I was
[3546.80 → 3548.80] sitting there thinking about it just
[3548.80 → 3550.80] now and this is no guarantee of what
[3550.80 → 3551.80] my actions would or wouldn't be because
[3551.80 → 3554.80] it was just you know dark thoughts at a
[3554.80 → 3559.80] dark time right I was like no I think I
[3559.80 → 3562.80] think the only viable I think the only
[3562.80 → 3566.80] viable options would be to bow out
[3566.80 → 3570.80] gracefully rather than sell to PE I
[3570.80 → 3572.80] don't I don't I don't think I would
[3572.80 → 3574.80] want to do that I don't pull a Jack
[3574.80 → 3577.80] Sparrow ride the ship into the harbour
[3577.80 → 3581.80] just like as it sinks and and and the
[3581.80 → 3584.80] only like the thing that bothered
[3584.80 → 3589.80] me most about that thought was that our
[3589.80 → 3592.80] world-class team would have to update
[3592.80 → 3595.80] their resumes with hopefully a really
[3595.80 → 3599.80] outstanding piece to put on it would
[3599.80 → 3603.80] yeah like part it out I mean we could
[3603.80 → 3606.80] this is a weird line of thinking to even
[3606.80 → 3607.80] go down at all especially publicly but
[3607.80 → 3610.80] like yeah I mean it's not impossible
[3610.80 → 3612.80] technically creator warehouse is a
[3612.80 → 3613.80] separate company from float plane
[3613.80 → 3615.80] which is a separate company from
[3615.80 → 3618.80] Linus media group I think those are the
[3618.80 → 3619.80] main ones there might be some other
[3619.80 → 3622.80] companies that kind of do things here
[3622.80 → 3625.80] and there at this point if you shut
[3625.80 → 3627.80] operations down shutting float plane
[3627.80 → 3629.80] would hurt other creators but tell me
[3629.80 → 3634.80] this you know what would be better
[3634.80 → 3636.80] for let's take let's take it let's take
[3636.80 → 3638.80] a completely hypothetical right like
[3638.80 → 3640.80] what would be better for someone like
[3640.80 → 3642.80] a Colton and the team at Disneyland if
[3642.80 → 3645.80] we parted out their department and sold
[3645.80 → 3648.80] it or if we did a severance package
[3648.80 → 3650.80] that gives them a little kick in the
[3650.80 → 3653.80] ass, and then they go and create an
[3653.80 → 3656.80] agency what would be better for them
[3656.80 → 3658.80] would it be viable for it to be an
[3658.80 → 3660.80] option I have no idea I have no idea
[3660.80 → 3662.80] that it is viable for it to be an
[3662.80 → 3664.80] option like each individual can either
[3664.80 → 3667.80] take a severance or keep riding the
[3667.80 → 3669.80] wave and see where it goes then I think
[3669.80 → 3671.80] that would be the way that I would like
[3671.80 → 3673.80] it to go leave it up to the employee
[3673.80 → 3674.80] and I think it would have to be something
[3674.80 → 3676.80] that would be a conversation right
[3676.80 → 3678.80] because not everyone would feel the
[3678.80 → 3680.80] same way that you would to be very
[3680.80 → 3683.80] clear like it's I don't actually think
[3683.80 → 3686.80] that this is the end and one of the one
[3686.80 → 3688.80] one of the one of the cool yeah if
[3688.80 → 3689.80] there are any employees watching right
[3689.80 → 3693.80] now I worry I was honestly very
[3693.80 → 3695.80] surprised when I saw that title come
[3695.80 → 3696.80] up as a newly published video I was
[3696.80 → 3698.80] like really I didn't know right after
[3698.80 → 3700.80] right after this I didn't know we were
[3700.80 → 3702.80] doing that I'm not surprised it's not
[3702.80 → 3703.80] getting views yeah it's all good but
[3703.80 → 3706.80] like just anyway the point is don't
[3706.80 → 3709.80] don't don't freak out because we
[3709.80 → 3712.80] are still operating extremely sustainably
[3712.80 → 3717.80] we have we're done a very good job we're
[3717.80 → 3721.80] not one thing of diversifying yeah and
[3721.80 → 3723.80] sometime it's its another group's turn
[3723.80 → 3728.80] to hold the ship together yep and and and
[3728.80 → 3731.80] and that doesn't mean that you know one
[3731.80 → 3735.80] group that isn't that no one else
[3735.80 → 3736.80] is carrying any weight or anything like
[3736.80 → 3739.80] that it just means that we are we're a
[3739.80 → 3741.80] bigger machine which comes with the
[3741.80 → 3743.80] disadvantages of being a bigger machine
[3743.80 → 3745.80] we're not as nimble as we used to be I
[3745.80 → 3747.80] think our brand has suffered a lot for
[3747.80 → 3750.80] being so transparent about the fact that
[3750.80 → 3753.80] I'm not just a guy in his house making
[3753.80 → 3756.80] tech videos I mean a lot of a lot of
[3756.80 → 3758.80] YouTubers whether you guys are aware of
[3758.80 → 3761.80] it or not or you think about it or you
[3761.80 → 3764.80] don't are enormous machines with lawyers
[3764.80 → 3767.80] and agents and employees and this has
[3767.80 → 3771.80] been astounding to me, I've been
[3771.80 → 3772.80] having more and more conversations with
[3772.80 → 3774.80] creators over the last two years
[3774.80 → 3776.80] especially, and you don't know that
[3776.80 → 3777.80] because it's just them in front of the
[3777.80 → 3779.80] camera looking all like they're just
[3779.80 → 3780.80] them in front of the camera one or two
[3780.80 → 3782.80] bit operations and figuring out it's
[3782.80 → 3785.80] like 15 it's like whoa like where did
[3785.80 → 3786.80] that come from so we've just been
[3786.80 → 3788.80] extremely transparent about it but
[3788.80 → 3789.80] that doesn't mean that we are any
[3789.80 → 3791.80] different from necessarily any other
[3791.80 → 3793.80] YouTube operation right and some of
[3793.80 → 3795.80] them don't want that disclosed which
[3795.80 → 3797.80] is why I'm not naming yeah well
[3797.80 → 3799.80] right because and it's a perspective
[3799.80 → 3801.80] thing to go back and do it again
[3801.80 → 3803.80] right like it has clearly been not
[3803.80 → 3806.80] beneficial to our brand and to my
[3806.80 → 3809.80] image for us to be a corporation and
[3809.80 → 3812.80] for us to put our employees front and
[3812.80 → 3817.80] centre right like from a
[3817.80 → 3818.80] corporate standpoint was there any
[3818.80 → 3821.80] benefit to the corporation to
[3821.80 → 3824.80] people gaining notoriety here and then
[3824.80 → 3826.80] taking that and going out and doing
[3826.80 → 3829.80] their own thing no of course not
[3829.80 → 3831.80] personally I'm happy to see people
[3831.80 → 3833.80] spread their wings but from a
[3833.80 → 3836.80] corporate standpoint no from a
[3836.80 → 3837.80] corporate standpoint it should all
[3837.80 → 3840.80] hyper feed into of course Linus fame
[3840.80 → 3844.80] it's exactly and and and boosting
[3844.80 → 3846.80] Linus's image like it's its not it's
[3846.80 → 3848.80] not good for there they're like our
[3848.80 → 3852.80] creators that will label work done by
[3852.80 → 3853.80] their employees it's just theirs because
[3853.80 → 3855.80] that's I know brand I know this is
[3855.80 → 3857.80] totally a thing I know, and it's been
[3857.80 → 3863.80] it's been very fascinating to watch to
[3863.80 → 3867.80] watch the way that that my image has
[3867.80 → 3869.80] sort of been morphed over the years
[3869.80 → 3871.80] because I'm not perfect I make lots
[3871.80 → 3873.80] and lots and lots of mistakes yeah
[3873.80 → 3876.80] see exactly right I mean I make tons
[3876.80 → 3878.80] of mistakes but some of the things
[3878.80 → 3880.80] that I have done over the years were
[3880.80 → 3883.80] done with a very high degree of
[3883.80 → 3884.80] intention like one of the things that
[3884.80 → 3887.80] I do when I co-host with people is I
[3887.80 → 3890.80] make myself the foil the clown the one
[3890.80 → 3892.80] the clown the one who asks the silly
[3892.80 → 3895.80] questions or pretends that I don't
[3895.80 → 3897.80] understand it like when I was when I
[3897.80 → 3899.80] was shooting with Charles interview
[3899.80 → 3900.80] style stuff when I was shooting with
[3900.80 → 3902.80] Charles hugger so we had the video
[3902.80 → 3903.80] that came out earlier this week
[3903.80 → 3905.80] chasing overclocking records and then
[3905.80 → 3906.80] we had the one that came out before
[3906.80 → 3908.80] where we were looking at the
[3908.80 → 3910.80] sub-zero chiller that we purchased
[3910.80 → 3913.80] off of him he hasn't worked with me
[3913.80 → 3915.80] very much especially not on camera and
[3915.80 → 3917.80] so what kept happening when we were
[3917.80 → 3919.80] making the video on the chiller is I
[3919.80 → 3921.80] would ask him a question and then he
[3921.80 → 3923.80] would explain it, and then I would
[3923.80 → 3925.80] have him I'd have him do another take
[3925.80 → 3926.80] and I'd ask him again he'd be like I
[3926.80 → 3928.80] just explained this to you, I'm like no
[3928.80 → 3929.80] no it's just for the camera like I
[3929.80 → 3931.80] understand it, and he's like oh but
[3931.80 → 3933.80] apparently I was so convincing in
[3933.80 → 3935.80] pretending that I didn't know what he
[3935.80 → 3937.80] was talking about in order to get in
[3937.80 → 3938.80] order to get him to be the one to
[3938.80 → 3940.80] explain it is his baby right he built
[3940.80 → 3942.80] it and so to me, I feel like he should
[3942.80 → 3945.80] have a chance to explain it, and it's
[3945.80 → 3947.80] and it's its just been it's been
[3947.80 → 3950.80] it's been fascinating to watch the
[3950.80 → 3952.80] way that that has been sort of turned
[3952.80 → 3955.80] into that I'm all about me a hundred
[3955.80 → 3957.80] percent all the time observing your own
[3957.80 → 3960.80] fame or something yeah I don't know
[3960.80 → 3967.80] like where oh yeah I remember where I
[3967.80 → 3971.80] wanted to go with this I've been trying
[3971.80 → 3973.80] to figure out what it is that makes
[3973.80 → 3975.80] this podcast or what live stream
[3975.80 → 3977.80] whatever you want to call it tolerable
[3977.80 → 3979.80] to anyone because do you even remember
[3979.80 → 3983.80] where we started here yeah well sort
[3983.80 → 3985.80] of would I take the Saudi money yeah
[3985.80 → 3987.80] right so you know how everyone who
[3987.80 → 3990.80] works here like has a DD yeah okay all
[3990.80 → 3993.80] the viewers do I think they must, it's
[3993.80 → 3995.80] it's the only way any of this could
[3995.80 → 3997.80] make any sense they can come with us
[3997.80 → 4001.80] because I'm trying to imagine someone
[4001.80 → 4003.80] in their car right like they're
[4003.80 → 4005.80] driving they're on a road trip
[4005.80 → 4006.80] somewhere, and they're trying to listen
[4006.80 → 4008.80] to this bullshit and follow along with
[4008.80 → 4010.80] if it's just like Dan hit them with a
[4010.80 → 4012.80] pole you got to hit them with a pole
[4012.80 → 4014.80] now I do think that makes sense
[4014.80 → 4016.80] because I was at an event earlier this
[4016.80 → 4018.80] week I suspect you guys all have
[4018.80 → 4020.80] exactly the same problem as me which
[4020.80 → 4022.80] is why you don't even realize that
[4022.80 → 4024.80] it's a problem yeah I was at an event
[4024.80 → 4025.80] earlier this week and I tangented
[4025.80 → 4027.80] before I really started a proper
[4027.80 → 4030.80] sentence like four or five times and I
[4030.80 → 4032.80] paused and apologized and both people
[4032.80 → 4034.80] like physically recoiled from the
[4034.80 → 4036.80] apology, and we're like don't worry we
[4036.80 → 4037.80] both have ADD it's fine we were
[4037.80 → 4041.80] following you, I was like okay never
[4041.80 → 4045.80] mind we're good Lord yeah okay so
[4045.80 → 4049.80] we're sitting at around 69% nice
[4049.80 → 4055.80] yeah Jira soul in float plane chat
[4055.80 → 4058.80] says we are ADD Borg resistance is oh
[4058.80 → 4063.80] butterfly what was that oh I was going
[4063.80 → 4065.80] to say something about oh right yeah
[4065.80 → 4067.80] the diversification we really
[4067.80 → 4069.80] appreciate our float goats by the way
[4069.80 → 4072.80] along with the people who support
[4072.80 → 4076.80] us through what float goats is crazy
[4076.80 → 4079.80] that's new isn't it no I don't think
[4079.80 → 4081.80] I've heard float goats that's not new
[4081.80 → 4084.80] have you heard that before yikes no I
[4084.80 → 4085.80] have not yeah I mean what's wrong with
[4085.80 → 4087.80] float goats that's messed up dude
[4087.80 → 4089.80] to describe the float plane subscribers
[4089.80 → 4093.80] they're the goats of float floating yeah
[4093.80 → 4096.80] yeah yeah yeah yeah they have
[4096.80 → 4098.80] perfect well they don't they don't fly
[4098.80 → 4100.80] but boy do they ever like they sit on the
[4100.80 → 4102.80] top of the water like the greatest of
[4102.80 → 4104.80] all time is it very nice when they're
[4104.80 → 4106.80] floating I think so what am I missing
[4106.80 → 4111.80] something good is this sexual yeah dude
[4111.80 → 4114.80] what goat greatest of all time what
[4114.80 → 4119.80] rhymes with goat for sure moat don't

[4131.80 → 4133.80] getting better at acting I actually
[4133.80 → 4135.80] have no idea you're talking okay, okay

[4159.72 → 4160.28] O.
[4160.62 → 4161.14] Lost.
[4161.50 → 4161.78] P.
[4162.08 → 4162.50] Post.
[4163.56 → 4163.92] Q.
[4164.12 → 4164.58] Quote.
[4164.98 → 4165.28] R.
[4165.78 → 4166.18] Road.
[4166.54 → 4166.84] S.
[4166.92 → 4167.32] Seat.
[4167.58 → 4167.82] T.
[4168.04 → 4168.42] Tote.
[4168.74 → 4169.06] Oh.
[4169.78 → 4170.36] It's so close.
[4171.24 → 4171.96] Tote.
[4177.54 → 4179.16] What's another T one?
[4181.04 → 4182.84] Pick a different T one.
[4182.84 → 4188.74] I was 100% convinced he was just going to say it and then get it.
[4188.74 → 4189.94] And then he said tote.
[4190.14 → 4190.50] Oh.
[4190.86 → 4191.38] Throat.
[4192.74 → 4193.80] There you go.
[4194.94 → 4196.06] Good job.
[4196.30 → 4199.26] You completely blitzed out of me with the tote.
[4199.84 → 4200.66] Worst joke.
[4200.90 → 4202.20] I didn't see tote coming at all.
[4202.20 → 4202.98] It's a word.
[4203.32 → 4204.44] What do you want for me?
[4204.56 → 4204.88] For sure.
[4204.98 → 4205.34] You're right.
[4205.44 → 4207.18] I just didn't see it coming.
[4207.58 → 4208.82] Carry it around a little.
[4209.54 → 4210.56] Spring it with you.
[4212.84 → 4214.88] Throat goat.
[4216.46 → 4216.90] Ridiculous.
[4218.90 → 4219.96] What were we talking about?
[4220.00 → 4220.42] ADHD.
[4220.76 → 4222.76] I think you were talking about ADHD.
[4223.26 → 4225.70] We were coming off of the back of the.
[4225.84 → 4227.48] I was thinking our float.
[4227.48 → 4229.16] Our float goats.
[4229.74 → 4230.70] I have a lisp.
[4230.82 → 4231.48] It's a disability.
[4231.66 → 4232.76] You can't make fun of me for it.
[4232.82 → 4233.94] I'm a protected class.
[4234.04 → 4234.30] All right.
[4235.06 → 4236.52] Our float goats.
[4239.90 → 4240.34] Stop.
[4240.34 → 4244.10] Our supporters on float plane.
[4244.22 → 4244.74] Are you happy?
[4244.98 → 4245.20] Yeah.
[4245.50 → 4245.98] All right.
[4247.18 → 4247.50] Okay.
[4247.56 → 4249.98] So I was thanking our supporters on throat plane.
[4252.66 → 4254.04] I'm just bugging them at this point.
[4255.02 → 4255.82] Oh, man.
[4256.02 → 4260.38] For helping make us more resilient against any kind of interruptions in our business.
[4260.38 → 4263.88] I think you guys might have seen not that long ago when we did how does LMG make money
[4263.88 → 4266.64] video that AdSense is like less than 10% of our revenue now.
[4266.74 → 4272.72] So we are a lot less susceptible to momentary changes in momentum on the channel.
[4272.72 → 4275.46] But we do have to figure out how to get viewership up.
[4275.46 → 4276.48] It's a throat plane.
[4277.28 → 4278.26] That's actually pretty cool.
[4279.50 → 4283.68] Was that the one that was made for that car that was like manufactured across the Atlantic
[4283.68 → 4284.18] or whatever?
[4284.40 → 4285.70] Is that the special one?
[4285.70 → 4287.06] It's a military plane that carries planes.
[4287.36 → 4287.70] Oh, no.
[4287.74 → 4288.42] That's a different one.
[4288.42 → 4288.66] Yeah.
[4288.66 → 4291.98] I don't actually remember what it's called.
[4292.26 → 4293.30] But C5 Galaxy?
[4293.68 → 4294.30] Yeah, that sounds right.
[4294.30 → 4294.38] Yeah, okay.
[4296.42 → 4298.86] Anyway, if anyone else wants to subscribe on float plane, that's cool.
[4299.10 → 4301.24] But we do have to figure out the viewership thing.
[4301.30 → 4302.32] And I think the tech house.
[4302.64 → 4311.60] I think that doing some bigger serialized content is going to be a huge part of getting back
[4311.60 → 4313.12] to the way things were.
[4313.24 → 4315.72] And also, I want to do some more back to basic stuff.
[4315.96 → 4316.40] Me too.
[4316.46 → 4316.98] So Plough.
[4316.98 → 4317.88] I want that to happen.
[4317.88 → 4321.78] When Plough came to Whale Land, he didn't want to haul his giant alienware.
[4322.56 → 4325.46] And as someone who owns a display, he doesn't mind purchasing a display.
[4325.98 → 4331.28] So he just went to Best Buy and was like, okay, what is the minimum viable monitor?
[4332.38 → 4333.96] And he got a 1080p.
[4333.96 → 4338.54] I want to say it was 23 or 24 inch IPS for $70.
[4339.54 → 4341.84] So we're just going to make a video about it.
[4343.46 → 4345.24] Actually, that's not a bad title.
[4345.48 → 4346.70] Dan, can you send that to Plough?
[4347.24 → 4348.76] Minimum viable product?
[4349.16 → 4350.50] Or like minimum viable monitor?
[4350.50 → 4354.40] That can be a series really quick.
[4354.40 → 4354.68] Yeah.
[4354.68 → 4354.92] Yeah.
[4355.06 → 4358.18] I think we could have like, yeah, series.
[4358.32 → 4359.78] Let's just call it minimum viable product.
[4360.02 → 4364.78] So gaming monitor, minimum viable product, episode one or something like that.
[4364.96 → 4372.78] Buying the bare minimum gaming monitor, minimum viable product or like something along those
[4372.78 → 4372.98] lines.
[4372.98 → 4375.50] I think we could make minimum viable product a series.
[4375.64 → 4384.44] So MVP is, it's more of like a software term for like your, the basic sort of spec that
[4384.44 → 4386.00] you think is shippable.
[4386.54 → 4388.86] But I guess, I guess you could also use it in hardware.
[4389.08 → 4390.10] It's used in a variety of spaces.
[4390.12 → 4391.58] In the hardware space as well.
[4391.74 → 4392.94] But yeah.
[4393.16 → 4394.06] Oh, dude, I love it.
[4394.24 → 4399.48] I like it because, you know, Financial Times are so tough, and its Financial Times are tough,
[4399.56 → 4402.16] but it's hard to get people to watch content about cheap things.
[4402.16 → 4403.44] I know.
[4403.64 → 4405.70] Which is a very frustrating combination.
[4405.96 → 4406.14] It's so frustrating.
[4406.20 → 4409.02] People get so mad at you for making videos about expensive stuff.
[4409.06 → 4410.08] I'm like, bro, that's all you watch.
[4410.08 → 4411.24] And they don't watch the cheap things.
[4411.52 → 4415.04] But if you can make it interesting, like we do with Scrap Red Wars and hopefully with
[4415.04 → 4416.16] minimum viable product.
[4416.36 → 4418.34] Minimum viable purchase is pretty good too.
[4418.72 → 4419.30] That's not bad.
[4420.04 → 4420.72] That's from.
[4421.60 → 4422.32] That's not bad at all.
[4422.34 → 4423.58] Game or something, whatever.
[4423.68 → 4424.62] I'm not even going to try to pronounce that.
[4424.68 → 4425.86] Either one of those works.
[4426.06 → 4426.34] Yeah.
[4426.66 → 4428.30] So yeah, I think that's pretty cool.
[4428.82 → 4431.14] I want, well, see, here's the thing.
[4431.14 → 4435.46] So Pugboy1321 says, as a poor people, I love seeing budget friendly stuff.
[4435.92 → 4436.48] Okay.
[4436.50 → 4437.40] But that's the problem.
[4437.48 → 4438.90] We're a product focused channel.
[4439.12 → 4442.70] And so how do I put this gently?
[4443.94 → 4451.42] Regardless of the cost of the item, a lot of people undergoing financial hardship are simply
[4451.42 → 4452.90] not shopping for anything.
[4453.18 → 4454.98] So that affiliates are lower.
[4454.98 → 4457.96] So making, I'm not even talking about that.
[4458.08 → 4459.46] I'm just talking views.
[4460.66 → 4461.02] Somehow.
[4461.56 → 4462.14] Oh, I see.
[4462.14 → 4465.78] You know, the whole K-shaped, the K-shaped recovery thing.
[4466.20 → 4472.34] Like it is actually, it is more, I was reading yesterday that the 20% of the luxury goods
[4472.34 → 4475.16] market is apparently the top 1% of earners.
[4475.84 → 4480.32] So when you think about that, you think about like the PC industry or whatever, like your
[4480.32 → 4485.52] top, if you expand that top 1%, you expand it to 10%, I think it's something like 50% of
[4485.52 → 4486.02] all purchases.
[4486.38 → 4494.02] So you're actually better off making a video about a 5070 Ti or a 5080 compared, sorry,
[4494.22 → 4496.20] compared to making a video about onboard graphics.
[4496.20 → 4499.58] Because if you think about when we were there, we were scrapyard warning.
[4499.84 → 4500.04] Yeah.
[4500.12 → 4500.96] We're buying used.
[4501.18 → 4502.42] So we're not in the...
[4502.42 → 4504.00] I bought all my stuff secondhand back then.
[4504.94 → 4507.60] The new stuff was for like other people's builds usually.
[4507.62 → 4507.84] Yeah.
[4508.18 → 4513.60] And then that stuff was for me to buy one generation later at a steeply discounted price
[4513.60 → 4515.52] because apparently these people don't care about money.
[4515.84 → 4516.06] Yeah.
[4516.20 → 4517.58] Like I still remember...
[4517.58 → 4520.38] Or you know, you build in a case, and you get them to upgrade their fans and then the
[4520.38 → 4522.32] case, the fans that came with the case are yours now.
[4522.32 → 4532.74] I still remember the guy that I bought my SLI 7800 GTXs from because he was selling them.
[4532.96 → 4534.78] Man, it would be sick if you could figure out who the heck that was.
[4534.82 → 4541.42] Because he was going Crossfire X1900 or X1950 XTXs or something like that.
[4542.26 → 4549.22] And I was like, so, you know, not to be rude or anything, but like a non-tech did a head
[4549.22 → 4553.36] to head of these and like the one that you're upgrading to is worse.
[4553.48 → 4555.82] And he was literally like, I just want to try it.
[4556.00 → 4559.64] And like when I'm done with it, NVIDIA will probably have something new, and I'll just move
[4559.64 → 4560.28] to that anyway.
[4561.12 → 4562.22] And I was like...
[4563.70 → 4564.32] That's crazy.
[4567.42 → 4567.82] Sick.
[4567.90 → 4568.44] Thanks for the card.
[4568.56 → 4568.92] See ya.
[4569.42 → 4570.44] Do you...
[4570.44 → 4573.18] Do you need a young boy to do anything for you?
[4573.18 → 4577.98] What was that?
[4578.06 → 4580.88] What did you call the full-play subscribers?
[4584.36 → 4585.40] I got Dan.
[4585.58 → 4587.58] I heard him behind the TV.
[4588.36 → 4591.40] I don't know if his mic was unmuted, but I got Dan pretty good.
[4595.20 → 4595.92] Sure did he.
[4596.24 → 4596.84] Where are we at?
[4598.08 → 4599.16] Did he get off yet?
[4599.16 → 4602.16] I mean, he got off a lot of times, but like the...
[4602.70 → 4603.14] Wow.
[4603.26 → 4604.40] He's trying to get his...
[4604.40 → 4605.56] He's trying to get his sentence reduced.
[4605.66 → 4606.68] People are talking about pardons.
[4606.80 → 4607.32] Is he really?
[4607.50 → 4607.72] Yeah.
[4607.86 → 4608.14] I don't know.
[4608.18 → 4608.44] You know what?
[4608.44 → 4609.58] Let's not talk about Sean.
[4609.58 → 4610.26] Did he...
[4610.26 → 4610.58] Coombs?
[4610.66 → 4610.98] Coombs?
[4612.36 → 4613.70] I don't know how to pronounce his name.
[4614.56 → 4616.12] Is it C-O-O-M-B-S?
[4617.50 → 4617.90] Commies?
[4618.22 → 4618.62] Commies?
[4619.10 → 4620.02] Like a communist?
[4620.44 → 4620.94] I don't know.
[4621.78 → 4624.20] Do you not know any of these terms?
[4624.82 → 4625.72] I know commie.
[4626.00 → 4627.10] That's not what he said.
[4627.10 → 4629.26] He just misheard me.
[4629.88 → 4630.68] Yeah, sure.
[4630.86 → 4631.14] Okay.
[4632.00 → 4632.72] Oh, man.
[4633.26 → 4633.68] Wow.
[4633.88 → 4634.32] Commies?
[4637.26 → 4638.24] Is that a thing?
[4638.66 → 4642.34] These are going to just end up as a soundboard.
[4642.70 → 4643.48] No wonder...
[4643.48 → 4646.04] You're training the AI saying these words.
[4646.16 → 4648.12] No wonder you didn't know what a hard R was.
[4649.80 → 4651.28] What am I missing here?
[4651.66 → 4652.46] Why it is internet...
[4652.46 → 4653.48] Wait, you still don't know?
[4653.82 → 4654.26] What?
[4654.26 → 4656.90] I can't explain this.
[4657.26 → 4658.86] Minus gaslight tips.
[4659.08 → 4660.22] How do I do that?
[4661.06 → 4661.80] Is it sexual?
[4662.26 → 4662.70] Yes!
[4663.92 → 4668.66] It's a cutesy term for the whole word minus all the letters past the first three.
[4670.56 → 4671.58] What, like semen?
[4671.88 → 4672.12] Yeah.
[4672.28 → 4673.18] What, you can't just say that?
[4673.22 → 4673.96] You could just say that.
[4674.02 → 4675.08] What do you mean you can't explain it?
[4675.08 → 4675.16] That's not cute.
[4675.52 → 4676.16] That's not cute.
[4676.16 → 4676.98] That's not cute.
[4676.98 → 4679.62] Please, sir, may I have some of your semen?
[4679.62 → 4680.12] Some of your mummies?
[4680.12 → 4681.18] That's not adorable.
[4681.40 → 4681.54] No.
[4681.66 → 4682.70] What is wrong with you?
[4684.94 → 4685.50] All right.
[4687.36 → 4687.70] Next.
[4688.32 → 4692.86] See, if I were to try to define mummies, I would think it's something more along the lines of,
[4692.96 → 4696.74] like, congealed semen in the shape of, like, little bears.
[4696.74 → 4700.28] Oh, they're like the fruit snacks we buy.
[4700.90 → 4702.24] Those are...
[4702.24 → 4703.96] And your ship gone.
[4704.28 → 4706.40] Oh, my God.
[4707.28 → 4709.76] What the heck was that?
[4710.86 → 4711.80] That's clever.
[4712.96 → 4715.10] Oh, no, Aaron.
[4715.46 → 4716.68] Oh, no.
[4718.74 → 4723.74] Oh, my God.
[4724.74 → 4725.94] Do we do sponsors now?
[4725.94 → 4726.26] Oh, no.
[4726.74 → 4728.20] Maybe we should have a...
[4728.20 → 4728.86] Maybe we should have a...
[4728.86 → 4730.04] There might need to be a buffer.
[4730.62 → 4731.40] A gal.
[4731.68 → 4732.52] Just anything.
[4733.52 → 4734.70] Anything needs to go there.
[4734.70 → 4736.56] Maybe just, like, a gaping...
[4736.56 → 4737.52] Oh, fuck.
[4737.96 → 4738.94] Section in between.
[4739.46 → 4740.94] Yeah, we'll just put this in a jar for later.
[4741.80 → 4742.14] Oh.
[4744.88 → 4745.28] Oh.
[4745.92 → 4747.04] Okay, we need...
[4747.04 → 4747.26] Oh.
[4747.94 → 4748.74] Something.
[4749.56 → 4749.94] Okay.
[4749.94 → 4750.94] Speaking of...
[4750.94 → 4752.34] No, let's not talk about that right now.
[4752.50 → 4752.74] Okay.
[4752.74 → 4753.24] Um...
[4753.24 → 4753.52] Oh.
[4754.62 → 4757.52] Can you go find an actual topic for crying out loud?
[4758.12 → 4758.48] Whale land?
[4759.02 → 4759.50] Uh, no.
[4759.50 → 4760.28] You want a real topic?
[4760.28 → 4760.44] No, no.
[4760.58 → 4763.78] One of the topics the writers prepared so we get through some of them.
[4763.78 → 4764.74] Okay, sure.
[4765.30 → 4766.76] We're supposed to do the CW announcement.
[4766.76 → 4768.16] Google and Apple cracked...
[4768.16 → 4769.04] Yeah, but we need a...
[4769.04 → 4769.68] We need a topic.
[4769.68 → 4773.06] We can do one of them ADHD Awareness Month, Linus.
[4773.06 → 4777.52] Dude, the sponsors are probably only going to watch their section, so we just need all of
[4777.52 → 4780.56] that to be far enough away from it that they don't accidentally click on it.
[4780.68 → 4781.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4781.74 → 4783.52] Google and Apple cracked down on Apple.
[4784.78 → 4785.92] Timestamps guy, by the way.
[4786.02 → 4786.14] No key.
[4786.14 → 4786.86] Anything else.
[4787.06 → 4788.50] Do not prank me in this.
[4788.50 → 4788.92] Here we go.
[4789.04 → 4789.58] Here we go.
[4789.70 → 4792.58] By the way, a lot of people don't realize that we pay timestamp guy.
[4793.24 → 4793.82] Like, I see...
[4793.82 → 4798.70] I've seen a bunch of comments lately that were, like, cheap fucking cunts or whatever because
[4798.70 → 4800.36] we don't pay for timestamps.
[4800.36 → 4803.12] You guys know we've paid timestamp guy for, like, years, right?
[4803.90 → 4804.88] Like, he's not a random.
[4805.94 → 4807.38] Like, do people not...
[4807.38 → 4810.30] Like, man, it is amazing the kind of stuff people assume about us.
[4810.36 → 4811.14] Anyway, carry on.
[4811.48 → 4814.04] Sorry, I was just reminded because I needed to talk to...
[4814.04 → 4815.40] I needed to talk to timestamp guy.
[4815.50 → 4819.60] I have a story just for you, lead float goat.
[4820.48 → 4821.30] There's pixel...
[4821.30 → 4824.18] Pixel users will be able to flip their nav options soon.
[4824.92 → 4825.12] Maybe.
[4825.12 → 4825.48] Yes!
[4826.04 → 4826.36] Maybe.
[4826.70 → 4827.02] Maybe.
[4827.44 → 4828.04] Let's go!
[4828.68 → 4829.04] Maybe.
[4829.04 → 4834.16] Android 16 QPR 2 Beta 2...
[4834.16 → 4835.44] What a name.
[4835.62 → 4835.96] What a name.
[4836.24 → 4841.16] Release revealed a new page coming to your navigation settings to adjust your button order.
[4841.64 → 4847.22] According to Android Authority, it will be accessible through a settings cog icon next to the three
[4847.22 → 4850.10] button navigation option in your settings, I'm assuming.
[4850.48 → 4851.98] It's exactly what you'd expect.
[4851.98 → 4855.56] It allows you to swap the back and the recent buttons in the UI.
[4856.06 → 4858.42] There's no further customization beyond that.
[4858.42 → 4859.44] Okay, that's all I wanted.
[4859.58 → 4860.82] That's probably all that was needed.
[4860.90 → 4866.50] It's exactly what has already existed in skins from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus,
[4867.02 → 4867.38] freaking...
[4867.38 → 4869.22] I think Vivo has it.
[4869.26 → 4870.62] What are some of the other Chinese brands?
[4870.68 → 4871.24] I can't remember.
[4871.24 → 4881.08] The point is, this has totally been a thing for 10 years ever since we moved off of physical buttons into on-screen buttons.
[4881.60 → 4885.40] And I love it because, yes, I understand that you like gestures better.
[4886.20 → 4886.76] I don't.
[4886.76 → 4899.60] I often find that when I'm swiping through a carousel, for instance, or if I am poking at something on like a desktop web page or whatever,
[4899.78 → 4904.52] that you can accidentally trigger the back gesture from either the left or the right on Android.
[4904.52 → 4906.74] I don't prefer it.
[4907.40 → 4910.84] I like having the back button right here.
[4911.06 → 4920.80] I like being able to double tap the task view button to switch to my last app rather than drag up, wait, move over and touch,
[4920.88 → 4922.54] or drag up, wait and touch.
[4922.54 → 4933.36] I am so excited because, not that I want to run a Pixel, I want to go Peria.
[4934.04 → 4943.28] And Sony has publicly stated that they stick pretty close to stock Android, whatever the f*** that means these days,
[4943.48 → 4947.70] and have no plans to implement it as part of their skin.
[4948.24 → 4950.64] But this might mean that they might get it.
[4950.64 → 4954.04] I'm going to have a headphone jack.
[4954.60 → 4956.88] I'm going to have like a cool, sexy Sony phone.
[4956.88 → 4957.20] Is there a headphone jack?
[4957.32 → 4960.24] Yeah, they still have phones with headphone jacks and nice amps in them.
[4960.74 → 4964.54] Dude, I don't even have to care that AirPods Pro 3s suck anymore.
[4965.30 → 4967.00] This is so cool.
[4967.58 → 4969.50] I'm so excited right now.
[4969.66 → 4970.36] They're really nice.
[4971.52 → 4972.54] They're really nice.
[4973.10 → 4974.16] He's intrigued now.
[4974.24 → 4975.22] He might buy something.
[4975.94 → 4976.72] You can have my old one.
[4977.18 → 4977.90] Next gen.
[4977.90 → 4979.36] Hand me down for Luke.
[4979.36 → 4981.92] I mean, I'm pretty down with that.
[4982.42 → 4984.70] Next gen is probably when I would be upgrading.
[4984.92 → 4986.30] So like around this time next year.
[4986.50 → 4988.96] Now, to be clear, this setting is not even live yet.
[4989.22 → 4990.00] This isn't a guarantee.
[4990.48 → 5000.00] Android Authority had to tinker to enable it and believes the feature will only appear in December's public release if it's also available in the next beta release.
[5000.00 → 5004.64] But like seriously, this is an obstacle for me.
[5004.76 → 5012.76] And what's really frustrating is you used to be able to just do this with third party launchers, even on phones that didn't have built in support for it.
[5012.76 → 5021.92] But Google locked that down during like launcher lockdown gate a thousand years ago when they had far less control over customizing the navigation of the system.
[5022.00 → 5028.08] So it's just been this there's just been this desert of wow, what a stupid problem for us to even have.
[5028.14 → 5028.90] Can we just fix it?
[5028.90 → 5034.36] Because literally your largest handset OEM puts the back button on the right.
[5034.46 → 5040.50] So literally anybody coming from a Samsung is going, if they didn't change the setting, is going to be used to that.
[5040.64 → 5042.92] So just make it an option.
[5042.92 → 5050.64] Like for years, many of the phones that I would switch to and that I would review would even have it as part of the setup wizard.
[5050.64 → 5053.42] When you set up your phone, they would prompt you, hey, where do you want these?
[5055.28 → 5056.44] Just so just do it.
[5056.50 → 5059.56] It's how many lines of code is this for real, though?
[5060.18 → 5062.52] Just move this button there and move this one there.
[5063.18 → 5063.82] Interchange them.
[5063.92 → 5071.38] Like, honestly, if Corsair and Plato can have configurable buttons on a stream deck, you do not have an excuse.
[5071.38 → 5072.94] I want to see something a little bit whack.
[5073.24 → 5074.22] I'd love to.
[5074.32 → 5075.66] I tried to look up Peria phones.
[5076.48 → 5078.08] Wikipedia is the first.
[5078.94 → 5081.12] Well, yeah, I mean, they're not in this market anymore.
[5081.12 → 5081.38] They do zero market.
[5081.72 → 5082.62] They never have.
[5082.82 → 5082.98] Yeah.
[5083.10 → 5084.10] That's still like.
[5084.32 → 5089.44] And whether Dan was referring to their market share or their marketing, he's right.
[5090.60 → 5091.48] Yeah, correct.
[5092.62 → 5094.52] So can you even buy them here?
[5094.76 → 5095.96] I don't know, but I'll find one.
[5096.02 → 5096.54] I'll find a way.
[5096.82 → 5097.60] I'll get one.
[5097.60 → 5098.46] I import them.
[5098.56 → 5100.72] The newer models have a U.S. variant,
[5100.72 → 5107.94] but the rest of them are like, I buy the China ones because they have, like the Hong Kong variant has unlocked bootloaders.
[5108.04 → 5110.30] So you can literally like to put whatever you want on it.
[5110.40 → 5110.84] That makes sense.
[5110.96 → 5114.90] Dual SIM, SD card, physical SIM, headphone jack.
[5116.28 → 5119.10] Mine's got like Weiss lenses, physical zoom.
[5119.54 → 5120.74] The camera bump's not that bad.
[5120.98 → 5124.24] They have cool features that go along with their cameras too.
[5124.36 → 5126.10] Like you can use them as viewfinders and stuff.
[5126.10 → 5126.86] Some of them like.
[5127.00 → 5127.44] HDR.
[5127.86 → 5132.60] If you have a PlayStation, you can use it as a wireless screen that attaches to the top of your controller.
[5132.82 → 5134.74] It's like kind of bonkers.
[5134.74 → 5141.22] This model that I have here had the highest PPI of any phone at 630.
[5141.22 → 5141.50] What?
[5141.72 → 5142.70] Okay, that's just dumb.
[5142.90 → 5145.28] I actually do not support Sony's ridiculous display.
[5145.28 → 5147.58] They downgraded the display in the later model.
[5147.64 → 5148.12] They should have.
[5148.26 → 5153.62] But I'm upset because this one's 21 by 9 and the new ones are a slightly different aspect ratio.
[5153.80 → 5153.94] Yeah.
[5153.96 → 5156.10] It has no notch and no hole punch.
[5156.34 → 5156.58] Yep.
[5156.58 → 5158.22] Which is another reason why I like them.
[5158.42 → 5159.34] I'm so excited.
[5159.34 → 5165.24] I'm just going to, I'm going to immediately go Sony as soon as I can get a skin that has the button on the right.
[5165.76 → 5173.48] I, and it's not even because I couldn't just use gestures on the Sony, but I, I said, and I am a man of my word.
[5174.20 → 5179.44] I said that I want them to fix it and I will use a Peria phone when they fix it.
[5179.44 → 5184.18] So in much the same way that I told Plex, Hey, fix your, fix your shit.
[5184.62 → 5190.08] And then we will be able to work together and as you know, and promote your stuff again.
[5190.68 → 5193.58] Um, and we won't do it until they do same thing.
[5194.56 → 5195.00] Yeah.
[5195.34 → 5196.10] Customizable is good.
[5196.24 → 5196.82] I support you.
[5197.34 → 5201.26] It's surprising how hard it is to even find any information on these phones.
[5201.26 → 5201.56] Oh yeah.
[5201.86 → 5202.00] Yeah.
[5202.00 → 5202.60] They don't bother.
[5202.94 → 5208.16] Um, they've often before just been like, Hey, we're going to release a new phone in like eight months.
[5208.16 → 5209.46] And then no one cares.
[5209.68 → 5211.94] Whereas Samsung like new phone coming next week.
[5212.14 → 5212.64] Hi train.
[5212.78 → 5214.66] And Sony's just like, we're going to release the next phone.
[5214.88 → 5219.52] It looks exactly like the old phone, but it's an indecipherable name.
[5219.66 → 5221.22] It is slightly better.
[5221.54 → 5222.98] Like every other phone.
[5223.16 → 5224.26] We don't care.
[5224.78 → 5227.24] Uh, we will sell 20 and they will be the best phone.
[5227.30 → 5228.30] I don't, whatever.
[5228.86 → 5229.86] That's so weird.
[5229.86 → 5233.14] It's waterproof, and it has dual SIM SD card.
[5233.28 → 5234.94] It has toolless SIM removal.
[5235.06 → 5236.94] They were the first to do waterproof, weren't they?
[5237.28 → 5237.88] I have no idea.
[5237.88 → 5238.66] I believe so.
[5238.72 → 5239.60] Was it the Peria?
[5239.82 → 5241.06] Was it the Peria one?
[5241.18 → 5241.94] I remember that being a thing.
[5242.06 → 5243.48] If they weren't the first, they were close.
[5244.24 → 5244.42] Yeah.
[5244.46 → 5248.22] They were, they were very early on the whole waterproof phone thing.
[5248.24 → 5249.08] Not actually proof, obviously.
[5250.36 → 5251.00] The Peria Z?
[5252.48 → 5252.88] Yeah.
[5252.88 → 5254.42] Because I think I did a video.
[5254.52 → 5257.38] I don't know how credible TNT magazine.com is.
[5257.38 → 5259.72] I mean, this isn't even grammatically correct, but.
[5260.20 → 5260.90] Sony announced, dude.
[5260.90 → 5267.68] I seem to recall that there was a there was a display that they had at CES where they had
[5267.68 → 5272.86] the phone submerged in water and the screen was on or something like, yeah, this, this,
[5273.12 → 5273.56] this thing.
[5274.26 → 5275.20] I saw this.
[5275.76 → 5276.08] Yeah.
[5276.46 → 5277.10] Remember this?
[5277.24 → 5277.82] Did you see this?
[5277.88 → 5278.14] Yeah.
[5278.14 → 5278.40] Cool.
[5278.40 → 5281.42] This was, this was like.
[5281.60 → 5282.98] That was nuts back then, dude.
[5283.04 → 5283.86] That was crazy.
[5283.86 → 5284.12] Yeah.
[5284.40 → 5286.64] This, this blew people's minds back then.
[5286.64 → 5290.12] And the fact that they made it so that you hold the button to do it was like such a.
[5290.32 → 5291.02] What a flex.
[5291.14 → 5291.82] Good stop.
[5291.82 → 5292.68] What a flex.
[5293.10 → 5293.34] Yeah.
[5293.34 → 5294.72] All right, Dan, what are we supposed to be doing?
[5295.08 → 5297.80] We could do a couple of merch messages and the CW announcement.
[5297.96 → 5298.70] Which one goes first?
[5298.78 → 5300.48] Don't, don't tell me more than one thing.
[5300.54 → 5301.48] Just tell me one thing.
[5301.58 → 5303.90] Cause otherwise I don't even know any of the things you said.
[5304.20 → 5305.00] CW announcements.
[5305.14 → 5305.46] Yes, sir.
[5306.24 → 5307.26] Got an everyday carry.
[5307.78 → 5313.34] How about we make that and everything carry this weekend starting now.
[5313.34 → 5320.38] You can get our cargo pants for just $99 and 99 cents on both our U S and global site.
[5320.38 → 5324.46] Shop now at LMG.GG slash cargo pants.
[5324.56 → 5326.94] They've been extremely well received.
[5327.36 → 5329.08] Almost too perfect.
[5329.22 → 5330.52] Says Willie B.
[5330.98 → 5334.52] Smart design, cozy and Unitarian.
[5335.10 → 5336.58] Do you mean utilitarian?
[5337.72 → 5339.92] What the heck is Unitarian?
[5341.34 → 5343.50] Now I'm Unitarianism.
[5343.88 → 5348.62] A liberal religious tradition that affirms the unity of God rather than the Christian Trinity.
[5348.62 → 5349.36] Oh yes.
[5349.36 → 5352.90] And emphasizes individual freedom of belief, compassion and social justice.
[5353.12 → 5354.96] My aunt is a Unitarian minister.
[5355.42 → 5355.70] Oh.
[5356.10 → 5356.50] Really?
[5356.68 → 5357.04] Yeah.
[5357.16 → 5359.70] I don't think that's what they meant for the pants.
[5360.06 → 5360.88] Probably not.
[5360.96 → 5361.50] I'm assuming.
[5361.72 → 5361.90] No.
[5361.90 → 5363.72] Yeah, I'm thinking probably not.
[5364.42 → 5367.82] Anyway, the point is that, oh, here we go.
[5368.30 → 5370.84] Chase R. says, great work pants.
[5370.86 → 5371.88] I'm a controls engineer.
[5372.34 → 5374.32] These pants are great for the job site.
[5374.32 → 5374.80] Yeah.
[5375.22 → 5375.96] Great pants.
[5376.18 → 5383.98] So get yourself some cargo pants for $99.99 on both the U S and global site.
[5384.26 → 5385.88] But that's not all.
[5386.12 → 5391.26] If you buy a precision screwdriver and a bit case bundle, we'll throw in an end cap set for free.
[5391.26 → 5397.10] So that's the alternate ends for the top of the precision screwdriver that are either devoted,
[5397.50 → 5402.10] so if you prefer to put your thumb on the top when you're using it, or rounded at the top,
[5402.36 → 5403.84] if you're more of like a upper.
[5404.26 → 5408.20] And then we have a different colour, a black one of the flat one.
[5408.64 → 5413.14] All you have to do is add both a precision screwdriver and a bit of case bundle to your cart,
[5413.14 → 5415.84] and also the end cap set, I think.
[5416.30 → 5419.42] And the discount will automatically apply on checkout.
[5419.62 → 5423.06] LEG.GG slash precision bundle.
[5423.94 → 5425.04] Precision screwdriver and a bit case.
[5425.12 → 5427.90] So you add that there, and then we have the information on the bundle there.
[5428.16 → 5431.88] So that'll be a great way for you guys to send a merch message to the show.
[5431.88 → 5436.72] If you are new to the show, merch messages are the way that we do interaction.
[5436.90 → 5440.00] If you're going to have to throw your money at the screen to interact with a live stream,
[5440.32 → 5444.72] you know, like people do, then you might as well do it in a way that gets you high-quality merchandise
[5444.72 → 5449.74] in the mail in a little while, rather than just throwing it out there and hoping for the best.
[5449.80 → 5450.90] At least that's the way we see it.
[5451.64 → 5456.42] So all you've got to do to send a merch message is added one of those terrific items to your cart,
[5456.54 → 5459.46] and you will see this interface, merch messages.
[5459.46 → 5461.20] You can show your first name and last name.
[5461.32 → 5462.24] You can make it anonymous.
[5462.90 → 5463.88] Either way is good.
[5463.96 → 5464.66] You can pick a colour.
[5464.76 → 5466.52] Look at that colour-changing thing.
[5466.84 → 5467.74] Isn't that incredible?
[5467.88 → 5468.66] Great job coming in.
[5468.66 → 5474.34] You can type a message, and then it will go to Producer Dan, who will, I don't know,
[5474.42 → 5475.06] he'll do something.
[5475.18 → 5478.00] He'll reply to it, or he'll forward it, or he'll curate it.
[5478.06 → 5479.80] And curated ones go a little something like this.
[5479.86 → 5481.12] Dan, hit me with a merch message.
[5481.24 → 5481.60] Absolutely.
[5481.76 → 5483.18] We've got a few in already.
[5483.62 → 5484.74] I bet we do with those deals.
[5484.94 → 5488.24] Hey, DLL, quarter whale VIP here.
[5488.24 → 5490.82] I guess that's one of four whale VIPs here.
[5490.84 → 5492.96] That makes a lot more sense than a quarter of one of them.
[5493.08 → 5493.42] Oh, no.
[5493.52 → 5494.22] They could have gone in.
[5494.50 → 5494.98] Bulk deal.
[5494.98 → 5498.22] You can have more.
[5498.40 → 5502.12] More like they could be in four pieces, but they probably wouldn't be typing anything
[5502.12 → 5502.70] at that point.
[5503.84 → 5504.40] I mean, hand.
[5504.84 → 5505.90] Hand is one of the four.
[5507.02 → 5509.26] Yeah, but that wouldn't be a quarter of them by mass.
[5509.88 → 5510.24] Truth.
[5510.82 → 5511.22] Truth.
[5511.72 → 5512.38] All legs.
[5513.48 → 5515.68] But, Linus, did you enjoy the whale land?
[5515.88 → 5518.72] Also, the whales pulled off a complete win.
[5519.24 → 5519.60] Rematch.
[5519.60 → 5522.78] Oh, we got obliterated.
[5522.96 → 5523.34] What happened?
[5523.56 → 5526.28] There was a whales versus LMG staff game.
[5526.28 → 5526.82] Explain to me how you lost.
[5528.34 → 5531.90] Well, I lost because it didn't happen until pretty late on the second day.
[5532.08 → 5536.60] And no offence to my teammates, but I wasn't able to put together quite as stacked a team
[5536.60 → 5537.62] as I would have liked to.
[5537.62 → 5547.50] Also, I probably have, not including whale land, three or four hours in FPS games over
[5547.50 → 5548.20] the last year.
[5548.48 → 5548.98] What game was it?
[5549.06 → 5550.30] It just hasn't been what I've been playing.
[5550.82 → 5558.28] And they went and practiced throughout the land playing UT 2004 and challenged us to that.
[5558.52 → 5560.58] That's a game where practice is going to make a difference.
[5560.76 → 5562.22] Yeah, a little bit.
[5562.22 → 5567.36] So, we went on to unfamiliar PCs with, in some cases, unfamiliar peripherals.
[5567.90 → 5571.02] Nothing against Kyle, Tynan, and Chase.
[5571.16 → 5573.42] Chase, in particular, is a very good gamer.
[5574.98 → 5579.72] But if I could have chosen, I probably would have taken, like, Natalie.
[5581.28 → 5583.30] I probably still would have taken Chase.
[5583.48 → 5584.68] No offence to Kyle and Tynan.
[5584.78 → 5585.38] They carried.
[5585.54 → 5586.96] They did way better than me.
[5587.10 → 5589.20] I want to make this abundantly clear.
[5589.20 → 5594.68] But if I'm trying to put together a team of ringers, like, I probably would have taken
[5594.68 → 5596.18] Nat.
[5596.28 → 5597.20] I would have taken Chase.
[5597.72 → 5599.70] And then I'd have to figure out the last one.
[5599.74 → 5600.38] Who else is pretty good?
[5600.42 → 5601.38] I know David's perfect.
[5602.06 → 5604.02] I don't know if he plays as much anymore, though.
[5604.16 → 5604.78] So, what was the game?
[5605.66 → 5606.20] UT 2004.
[5606.94 → 5607.68] IT Thomas.
[5607.70 → 5608.00] Damn.
[5608.46 → 5608.96] Was he there?
[5609.80 → 5610.78] Oh, he was.
[5610.96 → 5613.66] I didn't know that Thomas was, like, elite gamer.
[5613.90 → 5614.08] Yep.
[5615.00 → 5615.36] Okay.
[5615.50 → 5616.42] I'll have to keep that in mind.
[5616.42 → 5618.18] I don't think he was there anymore by that point.
[5618.18 → 5618.62] Hmm.
[5618.98 → 5619.52] But anyway.
[5619.68 → 5619.92] Yeah.
[5620.02 → 5620.34] Okay.
[5620.50 → 5623.12] I might be down for a rematch, but you have to understand.
[5623.32 → 5626.36] I'm going to stack the deck a little bit in my favour, because if you guys are going to go
[5626.36 → 5629.10] and pick a game that, like, they wouldn't play me in Left 4 Dead.
[5629.90 → 5634.48] Which is also an FPS game, but one where I would absolutely tune them, no matter how much
[5634.48 → 5634.92] they train.
[5637.54 → 5638.06] So, yeah.
[5638.22 → 5638.58] Maybe.
[5639.00 → 5640.12] Yes, I did enjoy Welland.
[5640.20 → 5643.12] Not in the ways that I was expecting to enjoy it.
[5643.20 → 5645.30] I actually had very little time to game.
[5645.30 → 5648.36] I played, like, three rounds of Halo CE.
[5648.60 → 5650.96] I played one round of Left 4 Dead.
[5651.06 → 5654.92] I played a few games of Tapes, and then I played the game Against the Whales, and that
[5654.92 → 5656.42] was it over the span of two days.
[5656.96 → 5660.56] But what I definitely enjoyed was seeing it all come together.
[5660.68 → 5663.06] I mean, the project's been, like, years in the making.
[5663.18 → 5665.00] The last time we did a LAN was LTX 23.
[5666.20 → 5666.98] A public one, yeah.
[5667.12 → 5667.38] Yeah.
[5667.56 → 5668.44] Or was it 22?
[5668.62 → 5668.94] Oh, God.
[5668.98 → 5669.90] When was the last LTX?
[5670.00 → 5670.36] 23.
[5670.52 → 5670.80] 23.
[5670.80 → 5671.14] 23, yeah.
[5671.50 → 5671.82] There you go.
[5671.88 → 5673.56] So, it's been over two years.
[5674.20 → 5678.32] And the space, there were some power issues.
[5678.92 → 5685.10] We didn't let IT know that there was going to be the giant display that we bought on Craigslist.
[5685.10 → 5686.30] Or the computers on the stage.
[5687.08 → 5687.74] Until, I think.
[5687.74 → 5688.76] Or the tape-to-tape area.
[5688.86 → 5689.22] Day of.
[5689.24 → 5690.40] Or, I think, the VR area.
[5690.94 → 5691.16] Because.
[5691.16 → 5693.00] Or the insanely power-hungry vending machines.
[5693.02 → 5693.86] So, I can explain what happened.
[5693.86 → 5695.30] Okay, so, hold on.
[5695.70 → 5696.46] Give me a sec.
[5696.46 → 5701.08] Okay, so, first, the original plan was to line both sides with power.
[5701.52 → 5705.76] But then, they came and told us, hey, that exceeds the power budget for this transformer.
[5705.90 → 5706.58] You can't do that.
[5706.62 → 5707.48] And we kind of went, okay, fine.
[5707.72 → 5710.02] So, we'll do all down this one side.
[5710.20 → 5712.34] We'll do the tables with the spider things.
[5712.48 → 5713.26] The power boxes.
[5713.36 → 5713.88] Spider boxes.
[5714.16 → 5715.14] Coming out that side.
[5715.22 → 5717.30] And then, oh, we probably just need a couple on this side.
[5717.38 → 5717.98] Well, okay.
[5718.18 → 5718.68] Bad news.
[5719.56 → 5725.04] We ended up having to move things around because some staff members who didn't even bother to show up for the f***ING LAN complained
[5725.04 → 5726.82] about not being able to get a spot.
[5726.98 → 5729.54] So, we created a staff area on that side.
[5731.36 → 5732.42] That was a bunch of power.
[5732.52 → 5733.26] That used up a bunch of.
[5733.26 → 5735.14] I think I, like, populated it anyway.
[5735.46 → 5735.74] Yeah.
[5735.86 → 5736.20] Anyway.
[5736.70 → 5737.24] The point is.
[5737.24 → 5737.86] And I wanted to.
[5737.90 → 5738.08] It was.
[5738.16 → 5738.38] I had.
[5738.44 → 5739.90] I was gone because of a work thing.
[5739.98 → 5741.96] I wasn't exactly gone because I wanted to be.
[5742.04 → 5749.16] The point is that we wouldn't have had that power budget to deal with if you hadn't demanded that we change the layout of the thing.
[5749.64 → 5749.76] So.
[5749.94 → 5750.44] I'm happy that we did.
[5750.48 → 5751.24] We should do it next time, too.
[5751.38 → 5751.74] We should.
[5751.74 → 5752.70] So, there was that.
[5753.58 → 5754.34] And then.
[5755.04 → 5758.26] That used up probably what would have gone to the stage.
[5758.70 → 5760.16] And then compounding this.
[5760.78 → 5761.30] This.
[5761.56 → 5763.50] This vending machine company.
[5763.80 → 5763.82] And.
[5764.00 → 5764.76] Oh, this is embarrassing.
[5764.98 → 5769.16] I actually forget what they're called now, which really sucks because they were.
[5769.18 → 5770.24] Really fancy machines.
[5770.30 → 5771.68] Super cool about everything.
[5772.74 → 5773.98] So, they do.
[5774.06 → 5775.18] They do hot food.
[5775.92 → 5776.32] They do.
[5776.32 → 5776.78] And cold.
[5776.92 → 5778.26] Mixed drinks.
[5778.42 → 5778.56] Not.
[5778.62 → 5780.48] Not like alcoholic beverages.
[5782.88 → 5783.70] Oh, here we go.
[5783.76 → 5784.08] Here we go.
[5784.14 → 5784.66] I've got it.
[5785.04 → 5788.14] They're called G&A Robot.
[5788.82 → 5790.44] So, they posted on.
[5790.56 → 5791.32] I guess this is TikTok.
[5791.78 → 5791.90] Yeah.
[5791.90 → 5792.72] They posted on TikTok.
[5793.10 → 5795.06] Me trying it and chatting with them about it.
[5795.28 → 5797.44] And then they also brought an ice cream machine.
[5797.86 → 5798.36] So, oh, yeah.
[5798.42 → 5798.74] Here's.
[5798.86 → 5799.00] I don't.
[5799.10 → 5799.28] Yeah.
[5799.28 → 5800.04] You guys can't really see this.
[5800.08 → 5800.32] But whatever.
[5800.32 → 5801.48] There's the three fancy.
[5801.48 → 5804.66] Like very Japanese feeling.
[5804.66 → 5808.34] Like high-tech sort of Asian feeling like vending machines.
[5808.34 → 5816.92] And we've been in talks with them about having just not bothering with a concession at Smash Champs.
[5816.92 → 5818.36] Or at least not bothering for now.
[5818.36 → 5818.86] Oh.
[5819.08 → 5822.44] But having some options where we don't have to do the food safe certification.
[5822.74 → 5827.14] We don't have to do the license for it.
[5827.16 → 5827.94] And all of that stuff.
[5828.20 → 5831.64] Having some options for people to get like hot food after they play.
[5831.74 → 5833.28] Or have some different options for drinks.
[5833.46 → 5838.56] They do like coffees, teas, iced coffees, fruit sugar drinks.
[5838.56 → 5840.20] Did they have a Bob thing?
[5840.54 → 5840.90] No.
[5841.02 → 5842.06] Not at this time.
[5842.16 → 5844.46] I don't know if that's something I planned in the future.
[5844.48 → 5844.74] I thought I saw some art for it.
[5844.76 → 5845.40] But I wasn't sure.
[5845.48 → 5847.60] And then they had this cool like ice cream machine.
[5847.78 → 5853.02] So like having those for the players would be super cool during tournaments, during Whale Lands, or even just day to day.
[5853.66 → 5860.32] And so they like pulled out all the stops to try to get these machines to us in time for Whale Land when they found out about it.
[5860.62 → 5862.82] So then we had to pull out all the stops.
[5862.82 → 5869.02] And we didn't find out that Jim, who is the general manager for Smash Champs, like organized it.
[5869.06 → 5870.24] We didn't find out until he told us.
[5870.30 → 5872.02] And we were like, oh no, where are we going to put these?
[5872.50 → 5876.80] Oh my God, they need like 30 or 40 amps at 240 volts.
[5877.46 → 5879.32] How are we going to power these stupid things?
[5879.34 → 5882.26] Because we never accounted for having heavy power on that side.
[5883.92 → 5888.12] So, and then, oh right, there was supposed to be a retro area.
[5888.66 → 5892.02] And so Rove Lab sent over a bunch of like couch segments.
[5892.02 → 5898.84] So they're those like modular, they ship in a like vacuum sealed box thing.
[5898.96 → 5899.76] And they like to expand.
[5900.06 → 5902.56] And you can put together as many middle pieces as you want.
[5902.62 → 5905.36] So you can kind of make furniture in any configuration you want.
[5905.80 → 5909.12] And they sent over a bunch of stuff that was supposed to be for like a retro gaming corner.
[5909.36 → 5910.86] So we had all these retro consoles.
[5911.32 → 5913.62] And I think the plan was to have some displays.
[5913.78 → 5914.04] I don't know.
[5914.08 → 5918.00] I never saw any because I saw all the couches and I went, oh, what about 5v5 tape to tape?
[5918.00 → 5921.84] So then I went, and I found like a projector and I went and got a computer from home.
[5921.96 → 5923.32] Like my old media centre PC.
[5923.40 → 5924.46] I just brought it to the LAN.
[5924.64 → 5925.62] We didn't have controllers.
[5925.78 → 5928.10] So I just brought controllers from home to the LAN.
[5928.36 → 5930.94] And then I spent a bunch of my time when I was supposed to be gaming.
[5931.98 → 5936.40] Just ripping out all the stuff for the retro corner.
[5936.40 → 5943.70] And creating a 5v5, like a 10 player roguelike hockey game thing with like a 120-inch projector screen.
[5944.06 → 5949.56] And I actually, for sound, we had something on a projector at the test LAN.
[5949.84 → 5951.40] Or like we wanted to do something on a project.
[5951.46 → 5951.64] Right.
[5951.76 → 5953.52] We wanted to play tape to tape at the test LAN.
[5953.74 → 5954.30] The internal one.
[5954.34 → 5954.54] Remember?
[5954.98 → 5955.20] Yes.
[5955.22 → 5958.16] And we ended up having to go upstairs to the player lounge.
[5958.34 → 5958.50] Yeah.
[5959.74 → 5960.52] At Smash Jams.
[5960.52 → 5960.78] I don't even remember why.
[5960.88 → 5961.70] Because we didn't have sound.
[5962.54 → 5962.78] Ah.
[5962.98 → 5964.02] So, right.
[5964.12 → 5965.88] Luke actually helps me load the speakers.
[5965.88 → 5973.88] So for sound, for the little hockey game lounge, I actually used the audio solution from Scrapyard Wars.
[5974.70 → 5977.14] Because, I don't know, we're obviously not doing anything with it.
[5977.16 → 5978.16] It was just for Scrapyard Wars.
[5978.24 → 5980.72] So I grabbed the receiver, grabbed the speaker, set it all up.
[5980.98 → 5981.84] It was sick.
[5982.00 → 5982.16] Yeah.
[5982.36 → 5983.48] It was freaking awesome.
[5983.64 → 5983.94] Yeah, yeah.
[5983.98 → 5987.72] And I forgot how damn good that Epsom LS12000 projector is.
[5987.80 → 5993.54] Man, the only reason I'm not using it today is that the TCL X11 or whatever it's called,
[5993.54 → 5995.66] the 115-inch TV, it's better.
[5996.26 → 5999.50] But that Epsom projector, man, what a great projector.
[6000.00 → 6006.80] Yeah, I think, I mean, I think some of the problem, there was also, I think it was like three notable internet outages.
[6007.52 → 6010.12] Talos went down for a period of time, which is like very rare.
[6010.40 → 6011.12] Our switch.
[6011.12 → 6012.50] And then the switch went down.
[6012.52 → 6021.00] Our core switch went down, which to me is a little confusing, given that it's like 100 gigabits, like supposedly core switch or like whatever.
[6022.22 → 6026.18] I hope we're running like beta firmware on it.
[6026.18 → 6027.58] And I hope that we can.
[6028.36 → 6029.88] What the heck is that?
[6030.00 → 6030.58] Shut up, TikTok.
[6030.76 → 6031.80] Why would you play automatically?
[6031.92 → 6034.60] No, I know why you would do that, but also just for doing that.
[6034.74 → 6035.22] Don't do that.
[6035.22 → 6038.74] Yeah, so we're looking into those things.
[6039.14 → 6041.58] You know, we did a test run, but.
[6041.76 → 6043.26] Not with 250 people.
[6043.46 → 6052.38] There's a big difference between a test run, and now we have a stage and all these other things and 250 people and everyone's hitting it differently and Ada, Ada, Ada.
[6052.70 → 6056.24] Have you seen the, oh, I'm going to say this, and then I'm not going to have the numbers immediately available.
[6056.54 → 6058.18] Have you seen the data that went through the switches?
[6058.66 → 6058.80] No.
[6058.80 → 6059.04] The ports?
[6060.60 → 6061.50] You have seen it?
[6061.96 → 6063.34] Yeah, you posted it in our group chat.
[6063.34 → 6065.38] Did you see the power monitoring that AJ set up?
[6065.78 → 6066.00] Yeah.
[6066.50 → 6067.58] Also, he's down.
[6067.70 → 6069.70] He posted a video idea.
[6069.94 → 6070.64] Oh, super cool.
[6070.74 → 6072.68] Okay, we'll chat about that in that meeting.
[6072.90 → 6081.78] But while he's looking that up, AJ, who's like an IT infrastructure guy slash float plane slash, I mean, what does he not do at this point?
[6081.90 → 6082.20] Anyway.
[6082.60 → 6083.18] Been here forever.
[6083.28 → 6084.70] Once you're here forever, you wear a lot of hats.
[6084.70 → 6084.94] Yeah.
[6085.22 → 6090.32] So he set up power monitoring for the building, and I was going to come to sort of the power situation.
[6090.32 → 6099.36] So what we found is that even though our outlets are at capacity, we were actually nowhere near the capacity of our transformer.
[6099.52 → 6106.08] So between the two of them, I think one is rated for 400,000 watts and the other one is rated for 150,000 watts.
[6106.08 → 6108.54] And then I want to say, or 250 or something.
[6108.68 → 6110.98] And both of them were at like under half capacity.
[6111.62 → 6121.44] So knowing that nothing we're going to connect to those California standard power outlets is actually going to draw the full amount.
[6121.44 → 6133.66] I'm going to see if we can get an engineer to sign off on us putting some more drops in so that we'll just have better flexibility in terms of our layout with the understanding that we just don't use it all.
[6133.66 → 6135.08] And we use our power monitoring.
[6135.20 → 6136.02] Okay, what am I looking for?
[6136.02 → 6137.46] Per port 24 hour usage.
[6138.20 → 6138.68] Wow.
[6139.48 → 6141.14] Trying to figure out what happened there exactly.
[6141.14 → 6153.12] Well, anywhere between the lowest one I see is 1.39 terabytes and the highest one I see is 5.4 terabytes.
[6153.26 → 6154.80] Were people tormenting at the LAN?
[6155.42 → 6157.26] Trying to figure out what was going on.
[6157.66 → 6159.18] AJ's here, so he might be able to answer.
[6159.36 → 6165.48] But my guess was that there was weird stuff going on with Steam and like local sharing and stuff.
[6165.94 → 6167.54] Oh, that makes sense.
[6167.54 → 6172.90] We did tell people to turn off local transfers, but we didn't tell them to turn it off.
[6172.98 → 6178.24] What we said is that they won't get the benefit of our LAN cash if they don't turn off local transfers.
[6178.42 → 6181.02] But local transfers is a default setting now.
[6181.46 → 6188.06] So probably most people without even realizing it were transferring game data off of each other on the network.
[6188.22 → 6188.70] Yeah.
[6189.18 → 6190.18] Without realizing it.
[6190.18 → 6191.24] I suspect that was happening.
[6192.16 → 6192.80] Got it.
[6192.98 → 6193.92] I don't know though.
[6193.92 → 6197.96] That was my just like knee-jerk like, okay, what was that?
[6198.24 → 6199.30] No, that makes sense to me.
[6199.40 → 6199.88] Something happened.
[6202.40 → 6207.34] Braga in float plane chat says, Linus, why are you acting like it's crazy you brought your rig to a LAN?
[6207.56 → 6208.36] Isn't that the point?
[6208.56 → 6209.68] Hashtag you've changed.
[6210.42 → 6210.90] Slash S.
[6210.90 → 6218.26] So the reason that it was notable that I brought my old media centre PC to the LAN was I also brought my machine.
[6218.66 → 6225.92] It was amazing how many people saw my rig and were just like, you brought your whole rack mount computer to a LAN?
[6226.26 → 6227.92] And I was like, this is my computer.
[6228.16 → 6228.38] Yeah.
[6230.54 → 6232.08] What do you want me to do?
[6232.20 → 6233.68] I just turned it on its side.
[6233.68 → 6242.44] Oh, dude, the setup was so bank because I only have two mobile PCs right now.
[6242.54 → 6246.92] So I brought my ally with the KG, one KG mobile for one of my daughters.
[6247.22 → 6256.08] And then I brought my remaining working Flow X13 laptop with my other KG mobile for my other daughter, set them up for the ally.
[6256.30 → 6257.92] I just used like an external monitor.
[6258.04 → 6260.08] I pulled one of the ones that used to be in the gaming van.
[6260.08 → 6263.06] We've consolidated down to just the one that flips up from the roof.
[6263.06 → 6264.84] So they were taken care of.
[6264.94 → 6266.68] But then I didn't have a machine for my son.
[6266.98 → 6276.94] So I was like, oh, I guess I could just I could just drag his rack mount because I have an external water cooling box that has the same quick connect fittings that I use for whenever I'm working on those machines on the bench.
[6277.50 → 6286.42] If I need to have them out of the rack for an extended period, I just have like a three by three 120 mid fan external rad box to run them.
[6286.42 → 6293.90] But what I haven't gotten around to is replacing the asinine stock power connector for it.
[6293.96 → 6295.64] That is a four pin Mole.
[6296.48 → 6298.56] Why would I want that?
[6298.64 → 6300.38] I mean, OK, I can think of why I'd want that.
[6300.48 → 6303.90] I would run it through a PCI slot and just have one of those pass through.
[6303.94 → 6306.12] And then I would like to connect it to my power supply or something.
[6306.12 → 6308.32] And then I'd put the rad box next to my computer.
[6308.32 → 6313.44] But like, don't you think it's more likely that I would just plug it in to an external power source?
[6313.74 → 6315.12] I hate that so much.
[6315.38 → 6318.28] I can see the valid arguments for both ways.
[6318.36 → 6322.36] The point is, I want it to use an external power source, but I haven't gotten around to changing it yet.
[6322.48 → 6324.66] And I forgot to grab one of those little power.
[6325.04 → 6325.52] Sorry.
[6326.18 → 6329.18] One of those little power brick to Mole things that we have kicking around here.
[6329.18 → 6329.82] Yeah.
[6329.96 → 6337.22] So my solution was to rip my side panel open and power his rad box off of my power supply,
[6337.44 → 6345.36] which was only a problem when I accidentally didn't have my computer on for a while.
[6345.72 → 6347.34] Because I forgot I did that.
[6347.80 → 6348.84] And his CPU overheated.
[6348.94 → 6350.60] I had to do a USB BIOS flashback.
[6350.72 → 6352.20] Fortunately, the loop didn't blow up.
[6352.44 → 6352.80] Anyway.
[6353.10 → 6353.80] Sorry, what were you going to say?
[6353.80 → 6361.66] I was going to say, you know, if anything, having it be 4-pin Mole makes the conversions kind of nice and easy.
[6361.84 → 6362.34] Yeah, I guess.
[6362.92 → 6365.72] Also, Corey is the name in Full Plane Chat.
[6365.94 → 6368.72] This is a bit of a throwback, but said,
[6368.88 → 6373.14] My data consumption for Microsoft Flight Sim 2024 is currently over 2 terabytes.
[6374.36 → 6376.22] Streaming the world is data intensive.
[6376.80 → 6377.04] Yeah.
[6377.04 → 6386.58] Fun fact, my brother, his wife, and I went in on a combo present and got my dad Flight Sim and some controllers.
[6386.60 → 6387.20] Oh, that's cool.
[6387.44 → 6389.72] So a hot ass set up for Christmas.
[6389.92 → 6391.84] You got your dad a hot ass for Christmas?
[6392.02 → 6392.54] Mm-hmm.
[6392.56 → 6392.80] Sometimes.
[6392.94 → 6393.88] And your mom was in on it?
[6393.94 → 6395.84] Sometimes you got to do unconventional things.
[6395.84 → 6397.34] Weird family, dude, but carry on.
[6397.48 → 6398.76] I mean, look, I'm not judging.
[6398.86 → 6400.96] Whatever happens between consenting adults.
[6402.96 → 6405.72] Hands on throttle and stick for people that don't understand what's happening.
[6406.00 → 6406.36] Hot ass.
[6406.36 → 6406.94] Hot ass.
[6407.00 → 6407.78] Hands on throttle and stick.
[6407.88 → 6410.70] You can't spell hot ass without hoe and ass.
[6412.60 → 6416.22] Anyway, they had to upgrade their internet connection.
[6417.24 → 6418.06] Oh, yeah.
[6418.28 → 6419.06] Not even kidding.
[6419.26 → 6419.40] Yeah.
[6419.40 → 6421.00] It would, like, bring the network down.
[6421.08 → 6422.04] Yeah, that makes sense.
[6422.86 → 6423.26] Crazy.
[6424.26 → 6426.00] Like, what the heck?
[6426.86 → 6429.24] Yeah, no, that actually does make sense.
[6430.10 → 6431.78] I don't like that.
[6431.78 → 6433.74] They were talking to me about it.
[6434.12 → 6438.68] And he was talking about how, like, they called their ISP.
[6439.92 → 6441.20] I'm pretty sure it was Telus.
[6441.20 → 6447.36] And the person on the other end was like, okay, what are you doing when this happens or whatever?
[6447.54 → 6449.10] And my dad told me he's playing the game.
[6449.44 → 6451.98] And the guy on the other end was like, oh, yeah, it's the game.
[6452.52 → 6454.82] But didn't, like, really explain it too much.
[6454.86 → 6455.32] Maybe he did.
[6455.36 → 6456.02] I wasn't on the call.
[6456.02 → 6459.82] And then my dad tells me, like, oh, it's the game that I'm playing.
[6459.90 → 6461.08] My brain's just like, no.
[6461.08 → 6461.66] Come on, man.
[6462.42 → 6462.72] Yeah.
[6462.96 → 6465.50] Like, you can play games on, like, hotspots.
[6465.84 → 6469.28] Like, you can mobile hotspot your phone and, like, won't even touch your data.
[6469.42 → 6470.86] Like, this doesn't matter.
[6471.28 → 6473.64] Like, you can play counterstrike.
[6473.82 → 6474.06] Yep.
[6474.52 → 6476.06] Mobile hotspot and you won't even notice.
[6476.32 → 6481.84] Well, yeah, I wouldn't because, I mean, counterstrike is just walk down a hallway and then die simulator for me.
[6481.84 → 6482.30] Yeah, it's going to suck.
[6482.36 → 6482.90] But you could.
[6483.06 → 6483.24] Yeah.
[6483.24 → 6486.98] And then, so I'm just assuming this, like, tells guy is nuts.
[6487.16 → 6490.40] And then I start looking things up, and I'm like, whoa.
[6491.06 → 6495.52] Not only does it use a lot of data, it uses a lot of data at a time.
[6495.62 → 6497.38] Like, the throughput is crazy.
[6498.42 → 6499.86] So, yeah, they had to.
[6501.50 → 6503.20] It's such, like, an annoying gift.
[6503.82 → 6507.74] Here's the game and, like, an awesome set of peripherals to play it with.
[6508.08 → 6509.28] By the way, you have to.
[6509.48 → 6511.00] Upgrade your subscription service.
[6511.00 → 6511.80] Upgrade your subscriptions.
[6512.38 → 6512.54] Yeah.
[6512.54 → 6515.30] Now, every month you're going to be paying more for this.
[6515.58 → 6515.86] Yeah.
[6516.48 → 6516.80] Ugh.
[6517.66 → 6519.22] Here's a puppy, says Boston.
[6519.28 → 6519.74] Yeah, exactly.
[6520.14 → 6521.52] Yeah, it felt like one of those.
[6521.84 → 6522.80] Also, by the way.
[6522.88 → 6523.38] Merry Christmas.
[6523.38 → 6524.72] I got you inconvenience.
[6524.82 → 6526.32] Well, not only that, but I just.
[6526.32 → 6527.44] And a financial burden.
[6527.62 → 6531.66] I made a bad assumption as well when working on this idea.
[6531.66 → 6534.54] Because the racing sim world.
[6534.54 → 6536.54] Like, the racing sim upstairs.
[6536.80 → 6537.02] Yeah.
[6537.20 → 6537.62] You just.
[6537.86 → 6538.26] Okay.
[6538.60 → 6539.02] Go in.
[6539.14 → 6540.22] I have this controller.
[6540.40 → 6542.12] It'll set up a profile for you by default.
[6542.12 → 6542.44] Oh, flight?
[6542.56 → 6543.16] Yeah, come on.
[6543.26 → 6544.30] There's nothing.
[6544.68 → 6544.92] No.
[6545.92 → 6546.34] Why?
[6546.70 → 6549.90] Because you have to be an enthusiast to play this game.
[6549.90 → 6552.82] My thing is, okay, don't have any default profiles.
[6552.98 → 6553.44] That's fine.
[6553.66 → 6554.82] Let me load them.
[6555.58 → 6559.00] Let the community offer them up and let me load them.
[6559.12 → 6566.66] Because now there's these, like, way intensely detailed guides on how to set it up.
[6566.66 → 6570.16] But there's so much to do that it, like, is so.
[6570.28 → 6578.70] It would genuinely be easier for people to just export their settings and let you import them than writing all these crazy guides on how to do it.
[6578.76 → 6580.30] Like, come on.
[6580.74 → 6584.54] Nokia in chat says, wait, I blanked out for the last 18 minutes.
[6584.80 → 6586.10] They're still in the first merch message.
[6586.96 → 6588.14] Is this even a merch message?
[6588.14 → 6589.12] They're only getting one.
[6589.38 → 6589.96] Hit us with an.
[6590.04 → 6590.50] Oh, is that.
[6590.60 → 6590.74] Okay.
[6590.78 → 6591.12] Is that it?
[6591.22 → 6592.46] I didn't even know this was a merch message.
[6592.68 → 6594.66] We were like three behind.
[6594.88 → 6596.26] Maybe we should do a sponsor.
[6596.66 → 6597.70] Oh, yeah.
[6597.78 → 6599.88] Remember when you thought the show wasn't going to have enough?
[6600.20 → 6600.54] Yeah.
[6600.72 → 6603.40] You say that every single week.
[6603.84 → 6604.16] Yeah.
[6605.76 → 6607.82] The show is brought to you by MSI.
[6608.22 → 6611.38] Does it feel like your PC is performing like this one looks?
[6613.40 → 6620.14] MSI's new Codex R2 pre-built PCs can save you the hassle of fixing things or buying and installing replacement components.
[6620.48 → 6624.38] With configurations that include up to an Intel Core 7 Ultra CPUs.
[6625.20 → 6626.60] I think we mean Core Ultra 7.
[6627.22 → 6632.10] And NVIDIA RTX 50 series GPUs you'll be prepared to tackle just about any game.
[6632.20 → 6637.10] It's also got Wi-Fi 7 compatibility so you can get blazing fast wireless connection speeds.
[6637.52 → 6645.60] And their AI engine can see what you've currently got running and automatically adjust your configuration, changing things like performance settings and RGB settings.
[6645.60 → 6650.04] So whether you're upgrading your setup or making the switch from console to PC, come on in.
[6650.08 → 6652.76] The water's warm with MSI's Codex R2 pre-built PCs.
[6653.08 → 6655.02] We'll have them linked in the video description.
[6655.50 → 6657.04] The show is also brought to you by Thrum.
[6657.42 → 6658.90] You know what has a nice ring to it?
[6658.90 → 6660.62] With the help of Thrum.
[6660.98 → 6661.72] Probably your fingers.
[6662.32 → 6662.64] Got them.
[6663.44 → 6665.10] The handcrafted unique rings.
[6665.54 → 6671.16] Sorry, their handcrafted unique rings are made with exotic materials that are sure to help you stand out.
[6671.16 → 6676.98] You can check out the Aloha, made from tungsten carbide and beautiful Hawaiian Goa wood.
[6677.22 → 6682.90] Or, for something really out of this world, the Gibeon has real meteorite inlaid on a titanium sleeve.
[6682.90 → 6691.60] Each purchase of a Thrum ring comes with a free silicone activity band, an American walnut wood ring box, free worldwide shipping, and a limited lifetime warranty.
[6692.00 → 6695.58] They also have sleek minimalist watches that are made of some of the same unique materials.
[6695.96 → 6700.04] So head over to Thorum.com today and use code WAN to get 20% off.
[6700.14 → 6702.16] We will have that linked in the video description.
[6703.30 → 6703.94] All right.
[6704.06 → 6705.36] What are we supposed to be doing, Dan?
[6706.68 → 6707.68] You're in charge.
[6708.24 → 6709.16] P-charge.
[6711.80 → 6712.86] Let's do another topic.
[6712.90 → 6714.98] I need to complain about more things on White Show.
[6715.48 → 6715.90] You do?
[6716.02 → 6716.26] You do.
[6716.38 → 6716.50] Yep.
[6716.94 → 6717.58] Is that possible?
[6718.22 → 6718.50] Yeah.
[6719.04 → 6719.60] I don't know.
[6719.98 → 6721.96] Are you talking about something specific?
[6722.16 → 6725.32] Hobbes, like, potentially immediately solved my problem.
[6725.98 → 6730.64] There's, like, something you can just buy, and it can import profiles for you.
[6731.14 → 6731.36] Oh.
[6731.64 → 6733.42] It's stupid that it's not built into the game.
[6733.68 → 6735.06] This should really be built into the game.
[6735.34 → 6736.58] Microsoft, figure yourself out.
[6736.84 → 6737.88] But also, like...
[6737.88 → 6739.18] That's a tall order these days.
[6739.40 → 6740.12] Yeah, it really is.
[6740.16 → 6742.02] With what developers will they be doing that?
[6742.02 → 6744.42] With what studios they haven't closed.
[6744.52 → 6745.32] Will they be doing that?
[6745.78 → 6747.44] Vibe code me a profile importer.
[6747.54 → 6748.16] Oh my God.
[6748.24 → 6750.64] It'll get, like, 25% of it correct.
[6753.18 → 6753.70] Anywho.
[6754.44 → 6755.48] You want to pick one?
[6755.86 → 6757.68] And then they'll never be able to update it.
[6757.86 → 6758.88] Speaking of developers.
[6758.88 → 6760.44] Let's do Xbox may be dying.
[6761.02 → 6762.36] And it's doing it to itself.
[6762.48 → 6763.18] Yeah, good timing.
[6763.34 → 6777.00] Microsoft announced this week they are raising the price of Game Pass Ultimate by 50% in the U.S. and some other markets, causing a rush of angry cancellations so large that the Xbox website apparently crashed multiple times.
[6777.00 → 6784.90] This $10 price increase comes two days after Xbox president Sarah Bond said that Game Pass was already profitable.
[6785.52 → 6798.70] Microsoft tried to soften the sticker shock by presenting this change as an upgrade that adds Ubisoft Classics, Fortnite Crew, as well as a promise to have 75-plus day-one games per year.
[6798.70 → 6816.76] This comes the same week that Xbox's hardware's second price hike in less than a year, a month after Costco removed all Xbox items from their stores, and a few months after another round of closures and mass layoffs across Xbox Studios.
[6816.76 → 6829.90] Combined with the recent release of some iconic Xbox exclusives on PlayStation, Xbox devotees are beginning to feel as though Microsoft's Xbox hardware division may be in a bit of a death spiral.
[6830.74 → 6833.54] But not all is lost, X-Bros.
[6834.22 → 6841.94] Although revenue from hardware sales was down 22% year-over-year in the quarter ending June 30th, 2025,
[6841.94 → 6850.54] Microsoft's chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.
[6850.92 → 6862.16] With 37 million active subscribers as of July 2025, Microsoft may be relying more and more on that service to drag the entire Xbox division into the green.
[6862.16 → 6881.56] Which is the gaming landscape to which pre-orders of the new DOG, Xbox, Ally, and Ally X opened at a price of $600 for the one that has a CPU that's like five years old at this point?
[6882.12 → 6884.18] Okay, I don't think it's actually quite five years old.
[6884.18 → 6887.48] Okay, how old is the Zen 2?
[6888.48 → 6890.12] Zen 2 release year.
[6892.36 → 6893.00] Oh.
[6893.76 → 6894.40] Okay.
[6894.80 → 6895.22] Cool.
[6895.90 → 6897.60] Zen 2 launched in 2019.
[6897.92 → 6900.72] If anything, I was being charitable.
[6901.46 → 6901.70] Cool.
[6902.04 → 6903.24] So, uh...
[6903.24 → 6911.28] And a thousand US dollars for the one that actually has like a modern new CPU in it.
[6912.76 → 6913.06] Whew.
[6914.18 → 6917.92] I was talking to David about this, who's actually the one who prepped this topic, and...
[6917.92 → 6919.14] Or was I talking to Pouffe about it?
[6919.38 → 6919.64] I don't know.
[6919.66 → 6920.32] I was talking to one of them.
[6920.64 → 6921.38] They look so similar.
[6922.20 → 6933.16] Um, I was talking to someone from the writing department about this, and they were basically making the argument that the DOG Xbox Ally and DOG Xbox Ally X are going to be successful products.
[6934.10 → 6939.18] Um, but the price is going to be a significant impediment, and I don't know, man.
[6939.18 → 6941.28] I have to say, I think...
[6941.28 → 6943.86] I haven't played on it yet.
[6944.14 → 6948.98] As you guys may or may not have noticed, there's one sitting here.
[6949.84 → 6955.42] Um, that arrived minutes before the show, so I haven't even...
[6955.42 → 6955.58] Genuinely.
[6955.84 → 6957.34] ...haven't even touched it again...
[6957.34 → 6957.84] Well, no.
[6957.92 → 6959.30] ...since the event.
[6959.30 → 6961.84] It was here for like an hour and a half.
[6961.88 → 6962.58] Okay, well, I wasn't.
[6962.82 → 6963.02] Yeah.
[6963.18 → 6965.04] The point is that...
[6966.68 → 6972.94] I'm saying all of this before I've actually, like, given it a fair shot yet.
[6972.94 → 6990.66] But what's happening here is, sort of regardless of the price of the various allies and their Boxes-related sort of collab products, it's a fundamental shift in the hardware model of Xbox.
[6991.50 → 6991.72] Right?
[6991.72 → 7008.28] Instead of first-party hardware that is subsidized by a built-in game store collecting 30% from every developer who sells a game through it, which is what this is up against in the form of the Steam Deck, which, by the way, is on, like, mega sale right now and is an insane value.
[7008.48 → 7009.14] It really is.
[7009.14 → 7030.62] Um, this is relying on third-party partners who have to make their margin on the product, and as far as I am aware, although this may not be the case, as far as I'm aware, Microsoft has not engaged in the same kind of profit sharing that has driven, like, the mobile industry, for instance, to sell...
[7030.62 → 7039.98] So, like, mobile kiosks and mobile stores selling plans and selling hardware and then getting a long-term kickback.
[7040.22 → 7047.46] So, there doesn't appear to be a similar system in place to help subsidize this hardware for Microsoft's partners.
[7047.46 → 7048.96] So, I just don't really...
[7048.96 → 7056.66] I don't really see how this can compete with a PlayStation 5 and a Portal, which is going to cost...
[7056.66 → 7061.82] You could get a PlayStation 5 Pro and a Portal for the cost of an DOG Xbox LAX.
[7061.92 → 7063.34] This is a Steam Deck right now.
[7063.72 → 7064.12] Yeah!
[7064.48 → 7065.86] That's crazy.
[7066.32 → 7066.72] Yeah!
[7067.12 → 7068.88] Oh my goodness.
[7069.36 → 7070.12] A Steam Deck...
[7070.12 → 7071.52] That's actually nutting.
[7071.52 → 7077.86] It costs literally, like, 27% as much as this.
[7078.02 → 7079.60] It costs literally...
[7079.60 → 7082.04] That is the lowest-end model, and that is the LCD model.
[7082.20 → 7085.98] Less than half of the Ally, the non-X.
[7087.04 → 7088.18] Less than half.
[7088.62 → 7089.54] That's what you're up against.
[7089.64 → 7093.78] You're up against Valve taking their 30% and using it to subsidize their hardware.
[7094.14 → 7101.46] You're up against Sony being able to price a PlayStation 5 Pro plus a Portal at less than your Ally.
[7101.52 → 7105.04] That's a tough position to be in.
[7105.44 → 7106.90] I'm going to make sure I'm right about that.
[7106.98 → 7108.36] PS5 Pro MSRP.
[7108.58 → 7109.32] What is it right now?
[7109.44 → 7110.50] I think it's...
[7110.50 → 7110.88] Yeah!
[7111.46 → 7112.44] $750 US dollars.
[7114.82 → 7115.82] And that's the Pro.
[7115.90 → 7118.90] The one that most people agree, like, don't really need.
[7120.64 → 7122.60] And then the Portal is...
[7122.60 → 7124.66] I think it's $250, right?
[7125.70 → 7126.22] Hold on.
[7126.24 → 7127.04] I might be wrong about this.
[7127.16 → 7128.30] I'm going to make sure I'm right about this.
[7129.16 → 7129.64] $199.
[7129.64 → 7131.66] Oh, but it has since...
[7131.66 → 7132.32] Yeah, around $200.
[7132.60 → 7133.18] Yeah, there you go.
[7133.72 → 7134.60] So...
[7134.60 → 7137.70] Good luck, everyone.
[7138.48 → 7141.34] Well, we have a bunch of discussion questions.
[7141.70 → 7142.98] Ooh, this is a spicy one.
[7143.22 → 7147.84] Is Game Pass still the best value in gaming at now $30 a month?
[7150.08 → 7150.56] It's...
[7150.56 → 7151.24] Oh, man.
[7151.42 → 7152.38] See, but...
[7152.38 → 7154.58] I have probably just an annoying take on this.
[7154.64 → 7155.64] I don't know if...
[7155.64 → 7157.14] Sure.
[7157.22 → 7159.42] No, and it wasn't because you don't own your games.
[7160.12 → 7161.72] I don't think it was a good value.
[7163.22 → 7164.66] I don't think it is a good value.
[7164.72 → 7165.48] I don't think it was a good value.
[7165.48 → 7166.30] Okay, tell me this.
[7166.40 → 7168.50] But I value owning my games.
[7168.54 → 7168.70] Sure.
[7168.82 → 7170.42] But retrospectively, right?
[7170.56 → 7172.16] Just devil's advocate take.
[7172.24 → 7173.98] I have actually never subscribed to Game Pass.
[7174.20 → 7175.98] I also just pay for games.
[7175.98 → 7180.90] And a big part of that for me is that I can super-duper afford to buy games.
[7180.90 → 7182.50] I can afford to, which is a privilege.
[7182.84 → 7188.06] And I think it's pretty cool that if I really like a game, the developer gets all a bunch of that money.
[7188.32 → 7188.42] Yep.
[7188.72 → 7189.40] So that's...
[7189.40 → 7191.28] Not because I think Game Pass is a bad deal.
[7191.36 → 7197.92] I've made arguments on camera, and I meant what I said, that Game Pass has been, at times, an outstanding value for what it is.
[7198.32 → 7198.66] But...
[7198.66 → 7200.04] So let me make that argument, then.
[7200.04 → 7207.04] What if, over the last couple of years, that you'd been paying $20 a month for Game Pass, you played through...
[7208.28 → 7209.24] So that would be...
[7209.24 → 7212.94] I think it's discounted if you buy it on a yearly basis.
[7213.34 → 7215.26] But let's assume you paid monthly.
[7215.40 → 7219.16] So you've paid $500 in Game Pass over a couple of years.
[7219.92 → 7224.38] Let's say that you played through, like, 20 single-player experiences you don't plan to play again.
[7225.22 → 7226.46] Did you get a great value?
[7227.20 → 7229.14] What if DLCs come out for them?
[7229.14 → 7229.96] I mean...
[7229.96 → 7237.34] What if I do want to touch that game again for some reason, and then I cancel my subscription, and I can't get my save back?
[7237.58 → 7239.10] Because it's tied to that version.
[7239.52 → 7240.90] Yeah, and that's fair.
[7242.10 → 7244.18] But what if, also...
[7244.18 → 7246.16] What if I do want to play one of those games again?
[7246.34 → 7252.54] Like, it's a very specific what if to say that you played a very, very large amount of games and never want to play any of them again.
[7253.18 → 7253.80] That's fair.
[7253.90 → 7256.28] That might be an archetype of gamer, for sure.
[7256.28 → 7259.10] I'm certain someone watching this perfectly fits in that category.
[7259.10 → 7267.40] Or what if you're someone who, in the past, wasted a lot of money buying games, playing them for three to five hours, and then realizing they don't actually care about them that much.
[7268.00 → 7277.74] And it allowed you to be, you know, just drift around from game to game and not worry about the financial, the extra financial burden of that.
[7277.74 → 7283.00] I have literally run into a scenario where there was an update to a game that seemed interesting.
[7283.42 → 7283.60] Yeah.
[7283.68 → 7290.88] And someone that I played it with, when it first launched, I reached out to and was like, hey, this looks pretty cool.
[7290.96 → 7291.74] Do you want to try it out?
[7292.10 → 7296.78] And they were like, ah, I don't know if it's worth, like, reactivating my subscription.
[7297.84 → 7300.60] And it's like, all right, dude.
[7301.16 → 7301.82] That's fair.
[7302.04 → 7302.30] Cool.
[7302.30 → 7304.98] But, like, I just own it.
[7305.28 → 7307.06] So I guess I'll go check it out myself.
[7307.28 → 7311.02] There's a lot of discussion on this in the Float plane chat.
[7311.20 → 7314.48] Like, some people are saying, like, dude, game ownership is so overrated.
[7314.80 → 7320.72] As a gamer of 44 years, I have over 800 games, and I practically never go back to play one.
[7321.40 → 7326.92] Meanwhile, you've got other people that are, oh, this is an argument we didn't even talk about.
[7326.92 → 7334.08] But Fantastic, in Float plane chat, says, I've got something like 2,500 games in my Steam library, most of which I haven't gotten around to playing.
[7334.38 → 7342.40] So for me, I can't justify Game Pass subscription just because I have so much other stuff to play that there'd be no reason for me to spend more money on games at all right now.
[7345.50 → 7347.46] There was a Steam Autumn sale?
[7347.46 → 7360.62] So, Walker makes a really important point that we're talking Game Pass Ultimate, which not only includes the games, but for certain games, it also gives access to a cloud streaming platform, which might be good for people on older PCs or who are often on the go.
[7361.68 → 7362.34] That's fair.
[7362.84 → 7364.92] I didn't actually know that because I don't care.
[7365.06 → 7367.72] There are solid arguments, I think, both ways.
[7367.72 → 7372.58] I can understand there being scenarios where, for me, it makes no sense.
[7372.80 → 7373.54] I don't want it.
[7373.54 → 7378.54] I like the idea that I'm more directly supporting developers when I buy the full-fat game.
[7379.24 → 7382.20] I have a huge backlog of games that I want to play.
[7382.30 → 7387.26] I see no desire to be hungrily biting at the bit of new Game Pass releases.
[7387.66 → 7390.42] A Game Pass does not mean that you get every game.
[7390.52 → 7392.66] It means you get every game that's on Game Pass.
[7392.66 → 7392.90] Yep.
[7393.12 → 7397.08] And they could remove the game that you're playing whenever they feel like it.
[7397.36 → 7398.80] I don't like any of that.
[7399.30 → 7403.02] I also, like, I'm looking at the Steam Autumn sale, which is running right now.
[7403.02 → 7408.32] Hobbs points out that, in some cases, save transfers are not possible between Windows Store and Steam versions of games.
[7408.34 → 7409.30] This is what I was saying earlier.
[7409.36 → 7409.52] Yep.
[7410.02 → 7414.56] I think that's actually, like, really important, personally.
[7415.78 → 7418.24] You know, I used to back up my save data.
[7418.40 → 7422.40] Like, I still have my Dragon Age Origins, like, save file.
[7423.38 → 7426.44] I don't think I've ever actually been tempted to fire it up.
[7426.54 → 7430.78] And even if I did, the game has probably been updated so many times that it wouldn't even necessarily work.
[7430.78 → 7432.02] I've run into that a lot of times.
[7432.14 → 7433.74] So, I don't know.
[7433.84 → 7440.04] But then the flip side of that is when I went to start Tears of the Kingdom, I, like, super cared that I still had my Breath of the Wild save.
[7440.72 → 7441.32] I don't know.
[7441.80 → 7443.80] There are games I care about it a lot.
[7443.96 → 7448.08] There are also games where I go back, and I'm like, this save is unplayable.
[7448.62 → 7452.60] Because, like, I don't remember anything about what's going on.
[7452.84 → 7454.18] Or I did everything wrong.
[7454.18 → 7461.16] But then the Steam Notes feature is fantastic for that and is becoming less of a problem.
[7461.82 → 7462.66] What is the name?
[7462.76 → 7464.24] Control is the name of that game.
[7464.46 → 7465.00] Yeah, dude.
[7465.08 → 7465.92] What the heck?
[7466.22 → 7467.64] These type of sales happen.
[7467.98 → 7469.88] So, if you can just be a little bit patient.
[7470.58 → 7471.32] Oh, yeah, right?
[7471.32 → 7475.10] You can get Control Ultimate Edition for five Canadian dollars.
[7475.26 → 7476.10] Yeah, it's like $350.
[7476.10 → 7476.26] $350.
[7477.52 → 7485.46] Like, when you could get 10 games of this calibre a month, once you convert that to USD, I think it's probably around there.
[7485.48 → 7486.04] Not quite.
[7486.10 → 7486.92] Close, close.
[7487.06 → 7487.36] Eight.
[7487.48 → 7487.94] Let's say eight.
[7487.98 → 7488.22] Eight.
[7488.66 → 7492.22] Eight games of this calibre a month or Game Pass Ultimate.
[7492.34 → 7493.26] I'm getting these, dude.
[7493.64 → 7494.52] Yeah, that's fair.
[7494.62 → 7495.22] Every time.
[7495.28 → 7495.84] That's valid.
[7496.04 → 7497.00] Apparently, it's free on Epic.
[7497.82 → 7499.44] Or, no, maybe not right now.
[7499.44 → 7499.90] Oh, yeah.
[7499.98 → 7502.36] A bunch of people are saying free on GOG, free on Epic.
[7502.50 → 7502.96] That's wild.
[7503.58 → 7504.12] Control is?
[7504.72 → 7505.08] Apparently.
[7505.34 → 7505.68] I don't know.
[7505.68 → 7506.90] Is it free on GOG?
[7507.44 → 7508.14] That's pretty cool.
[7508.24 → 7510.00] You should definitely get it from GOG if you can.
[7511.60 → 7512.90] GOG is pretty based.
[7513.70 → 7514.08] Very.
[7517.72 → 7520.18] Yeah, I didn't even consider that argument.
[7520.34 → 7528.00] Like, the DRM-free nature of GOG is like the complete opposite of we will take it from you whenever we want.
[7528.20 → 7529.84] And you will pay us a subscription forever.
[7530.04 → 7532.22] And your save won't transfer and screw you.
[7532.34 → 7532.54] Yeah.
[7532.54 → 7535.06] Like, I would way rather support GOG.
[7535.06 → 7538.28] than get a freaking Game Pass.
[7538.36 → 7539.24] Like, I...
[7539.24 → 7540.24] I...
[7540.24 → 7540.84] No.
[7541.44 → 7541.82] All right.
[7542.04 → 7542.94] Not personally.
[7543.14 → 7545.06] I'm not going to judge someone else for getting it.
[7545.28 → 7545.96] Do your thing.
[7546.40 → 7547.50] That's a fair take.
[7547.50 → 7548.04] But it's not for me.
[7548.06 → 7549.00] I think that's a fair take.
[7549.54 → 7554.06] Our other discussion question here is, do you think Microsoft might be trying to push people...
[7554.06 → 7555.08] Support the devs, but hold on.
[7555.08 → 7558.08] Support the devs, but also don't buy it until it's 90% off WTF.
[7558.08 → 7561.64] I don't tend to do that too often.
[7561.86 → 7566.58] I was saying that's a start that is perfect if you're looking at min-maxing your dollar value.
[7566.64 → 7569.62] It's also not Luke's fault that the devs priced it at that amount.
[7570.68 → 7575.36] Like, you're still definitely supporting them.
[7575.72 → 7579.38] It's more of like a spur change kind of support.
[7579.54 → 7582.84] But that game's also been out for like eight years or something like that.
[7583.02 → 7583.38] Control?
[7583.46 → 7584.26] When did Control come out?
[7584.26 → 7584.42] Five.
[7584.42 → 7584.94] Six years ago?
[7585.20 → 7586.14] September 10th, 2020.
[7586.56 → 7586.86] All right.
[7587.60 → 7588.00] Okay.
[7588.04 → 7591.84] Our next discussion is, do you think Microsoft might be trying to push people into the lower
[7591.84 → 7597.02] Game Pass tiers with no Day 1 releases rather than just backing out of their Day 1 Game Pass
[7597.02 → 7597.64] release promise?
[7598.22 → 7601.94] Like, is this sort of tactical price increase of ultimate?
[7601.94 → 7603.98] Which I've heard is a decent start, actually.
[7604.24 → 7608.10] Because if you really care about a game, and you want it Day 1, you could just buy it.
[7608.46 → 7610.34] And for everything else, you have your Game Pass.
[7610.42 → 7612.22] I've heard that's a thing that like quite a few people do.
[7612.46 → 7613.88] So, I don't know.
[7616.26 → 7618.44] There's a bunch more discussion questions here, David.
[7618.76 → 7619.98] These are all fascinating.
[7619.98 → 7623.68] I almost wonder if this should just be like its own video.
[7624.42 → 7625.50] I'll mark that.
[7625.86 → 7630.38] Because, yeah, I don't think we can talk about this forever on...
[7630.38 → 7634.92] Maybe this is just a video in a bit.
[7635.40 → 7635.52] Okay.
[7635.58 → 7641.62] One thing that will inevitably be on Game Pass, because Sforza is a Microsoft Studio thing,
[7641.74 → 7645.30] but I'm excited about it anyway, is they are finally going to Japan.
[7645.70 → 7647.20] Sforza Horizon 6 is going to be in Japan.
[7647.94 → 7649.56] And that's actually pretty sick.
[7649.98 → 7651.00] I'm excited about that.
[7651.94 → 7652.58] All right.
[7652.68 → 7654.52] Let's move on, shall we?
[7655.00 → 7655.80] Float plane announcement?
[7655.92 → 7657.00] Is that what we're supposed to do, Dan?
[7657.40 → 7659.22] Where is it?
[7660.10 → 7662.54] Sarah Week is upon us.
[7664.48 → 7665.70] Here it is.
[7665.82 → 7667.24] Am I supposed to watch the announcement?
[7667.92 → 7668.90] I don't know.
[7668.90 → 7670.94] I feel like, probably.
[7671.62 → 7672.22] Do we have audio?
[7672.32 → 7673.34] Dan, does my audio work?
[7674.44 → 7675.62] What are the odds?
[7676.28 → 7676.78] Give it a play?
[7676.92 → 7677.26] Let's see.
[7678.22 → 7681.88] Do I have the stream going?
[7682.16 → 7682.36] Nope.
[7683.02 → 7683.34] Okay.
[7683.50 → 7683.80] Nice.
[7684.86 → 7685.42] It's muted.
[7685.50 → 7685.70] No, no.
[7685.70 → 7685.98] It's muted.
[7686.12 → 7686.26] Yeah.
[7686.26 → 7687.74] Oh, man.
[7687.82 → 7688.28] So is this.
[7688.44 → 7691.12] And also someone on the account watched it.
[7691.12 → 7698.46] So usually for float plane themed weeks, we spend time and money creating some elaborate teaser trailer.
[7698.96 → 7702.84] But I spent all that money on a trip to Crueller.
[7702.84 → 7709.92] So now Sammy's on the phone with accounting, trying to get some more money for us.
[7711.08 → 7712.60] But dinosaurs.
[7713.22 → 7715.72] So accounting says buy the merch.
[7716.04 → 7716.52] Buy the merch.
[7716.52 → 7717.20] Please buy the merch.
[7717.22 → 7718.10] Please buy the merch.
[7718.88 → 7719.72] I need to live here.
[7719.98 → 7721.36] Are you often the butt of the joke?
[7722.20 → 7722.64] Am I?
[7722.88 → 7723.52] This is mood.
[7723.80 → 7725.94] How many shirts do you think I've designed over the five years?
[7726.12 → 7727.32] We've got 26 here.
[7727.48 → 7727.64] What?
[7727.82 → 7729.52] You know when a cat will like butt scratches?
[7729.66 → 7729.90] What's that?
[7730.26 → 7731.86] What are your top three dinosaurs?
[7731.86 → 7732.78] Is Dilophosaurus?
[7732.98 → 7734.82] My dog reminds me of a velociraptor.
[7734.98 → 7736.64] So my dog is my third favourite.
[7736.78 → 7737.16] Pop out.
[7737.98 → 7738.64] Oh, there's your shrimp.
[7739.20 → 7740.02] Bone apathy.
[7740.50 → 7742.30] You can get some clams and mussels too.
[7742.78 → 7743.66] Bone apathy.
[7744.06 → 7744.74] Bone apathy.
[7744.88 → 7750.40] There was a point where I was quality checking every single hollow foil shirt that went out.
[7750.50 → 7754.66] So if you own a hollow foil shirt, I probably touched it at some point.
[7756.92 → 7758.14] I didn't know that.
[7758.22 → 7758.68] That's crazy.
[7759.10 → 7759.52] Fantastic editing.
[7759.68 → 7760.28] Good job, Sammy.
[7760.62 → 7761.02] Yeah.
[7761.28 → 7761.76] Yeah.
[7761.76 → 7762.58] I remember that.
[7762.70 → 7766.78] There were issues with the ink, and it was bad.
[7767.16 → 7770.62] And we were still new at all of this.
[7772.22 → 7774.10] And there was nobody else to do it.
[7774.62 → 7780.48] So anyway, Sarah Week is upon us.
[7780.60 → 7789.24] Our content highlights will include a Sarah Q&A, a t-shirt design ranking, and a very expensive travel vlog to Crueller, Alberta,
[7789.24 → 7789.98] a.k.a.
[7789.98 → 7793.56] The dinosaur capital of the world, according to Alberta.
[7793.56 → 7799.28] Also, we will have a limited run float plane exclusive shirt to coincide with Sarah Week.
[7799.34 → 7801.62] It looks a little something like that.
[7801.62 → 7802.22] It's a dinosaur.
[7831.62 → 7832.22] We have.
[7832.22 → 7832.48] We have.
[7832.52 → 7833.10] I blame Luke.
[7833.60 → 7836.00] I want to do another ad hoc Linus topic, though.
[7836.04 → 7836.64] Oh my god.
[7836.70 → 7840.52] No, we have to get through some of the topics we have prepared.
[7840.52 → 7841.66] Then we do it after dark.
[7841.76 → 7842.60] We have to do it after dark.
[7842.66 → 7843.36] We have to get through.
[7843.52 → 7846.64] People put real, actual human work into preparing these topics for us.
[7846.64 → 7848.70] Windows 10 is end of life.
[7849.06 → 7851.68] October 14th is when Windows 10 support ends.
[7851.80 → 7853.82] And boy, are things ever happening.
[7854.30 → 7856.52] Businesses are dumping their Windows 10 machines.
[7856.52 → 7864.54] And a substantial reason is due to the lack of Windows 11 compatibility due to the lack of TPM2 and or other critical hardware.
[7865.00 → 7868.68] And I guess they don't want to get modules and have people plug them in.
[7869.06 → 7872.26] They could use the extended security updates.
[7872.52 → 7872.98] Yeah, that's true.
[7873.12 → 7874.28] Like you're not doing that on your laptop.
[7874.28 → 7874.76] Yep.
[7875.76 → 7877.48] And, well, yeah.
[7877.60 → 7878.26] I mean, that's fair.
[7878.34 → 7883.20] Most of the pictures I've seen are old desktops, but they might just be, might be kind of time anyway.
[7883.58 → 7886.80] But that's a paid program, the extended security updates thing.
[7887.02 → 7892.66] So many folks are weighing the costs and benefits because it's priced at $30 per license per year.
[7892.76 → 7893.50] Would you pay?
[7893.68 → 7894.30] Oh, wow.
[7894.98 → 7897.18] That is an interesting question.
[7897.18 → 7904.58] Would you pay $30 a year to run any version of Windows you wanted?
[7905.54 → 7906.72] Like your ideal.
[7906.92 → 7907.56] And it was secure?
[7907.84 → 7918.52] And it had, if Microsoft had a program where you were still allowed to run Windows 7 or XP, but it was, but with modern support.
[7919.22 → 7920.06] Modern support.
[7920.06 → 7922.56] I mean, I have to assume that they could afford to do it.
[7922.82 → 7926.16] I mean, how many, how many millions of people are still running Windows XP today?
[7926.56 → 7927.96] Windows XP market share.
[7928.16 → 7929.72] I'm willing to bet it's not zero.
[7929.94 → 7931.22] It's quite a lot, actually.
[7931.32 → 7943.38] It's, uh, it's apparently, it's apparently still somewhere between 0.3 and 0.54%, which if you think about how many hundreds of millions of PCs there are in a year, there are in the world.
[7943.38 → 7948.84] Do you think we could say with reasonable certainty that there's a billion PCs in the world?
[7949.62 → 7949.68] Probably.
[7950.00 → 7951.02] One for every eight people.
[7951.48 → 7953.60] I, I, I'd, I'd say that's probably on the low side.
[7953.76 → 7954.64] That's decently reasonable.
[7954.64 → 7958.16] So let's, let's just, let's make some, let's make some dumb napkin math assumptions.
[7958.16 → 7961.36] Let's say 1 billion PCs.
[7962.28 → 7962.76] BUH.
[7962.94 → 7963.28] Okay.
[7963.80 → 7964.38] Times point.
[7965.08 → 7966.74] Let's use the lower end of that number.
[7966.80 → 7967.14] What'd I say?
[7967.20 → 7968.42] 0.03.
[7968.42 → 7969.58] Okay.
[7969.76 → 7987.68] So 0.03% equals 30 million PCs times $30 a year would give Microsoft a $900 million a year budget to maintain modern support for Windows XP.
[7990.54 → 7997.44] And, and that's like, I don't even think, and to be clear, I don't think that would be necessarily reasonable.
[7997.44 → 8001.78] I don't think that this is necessarily a reasonable thing to expect anybody to actually do.
[8002.24 → 8004.16] I don't think all of those customers would pay.
[8004.34 → 8011.00] I don't think Microsoft's partners would love to support umpteen billion versions of Windows forever on all of their software.
[8011.80 → 8018.68] I just mean, if you could, if you could pay $30 a year to run your ideal version of Windows, would you pay for Windows?
[8018.70 → 8021.34] And, and does this mean, well, I already pay for Windows.
[8021.64 → 8022.98] But would you subscribe to Windows?
[8023.10 → 8024.04] But, okay.
[8024.66 → 8026.66] Does this mean game support?
[8026.66 → 8027.36] Yeah.
[8027.60 → 8029.14] Does this, so there's all compatibility.
[8029.14 → 8031.60] It means it works like you'd expect it to work.
[8031.82 → 8033.22] It doesn't get new features.
[8033.86 → 8037.08] But, but it works the way that you would expect it to work.
[8037.08 → 8038.08] But what do you count for new features?
[8038.16 → 8039.76] Because a lot of those are compatibility things.
[8039.90 → 8043.64] I would say that, uh, I would say that Copilot is a new feature.
[8044.74 → 8045.14] Okay.
[8045.32 → 8048.84] Could I do the WAN show on Windows XP?
[8049.38 → 8050.50] Is this kind of what you're saying?
[8050.62 → 8050.82] Yeah.
[8050.82 → 8052.54] Could this computer run Windows XP?
[8052.54 → 8052.74] Yeah.
[8053.36 → 8058.32] I can play modern games and connect to Wi-Fi and do things like that on Windows XP.
[8058.32 → 8058.54] Oh yeah.
[8058.96 → 8059.18] Okay.
[8059.26 → 8060.42] So it's getting features.
[8060.76 → 8063.26] $30 is new features.
[8063.48 → 8063.96] Too cheap.
[8065.36 → 8066.38] I would pay more.
[8066.56 → 8068.44] You'd pay more than $30 a year.
[8068.50 → 8068.66] No.
[8068.72 → 8069.12] Who are we kidding?
[8069.18 → 8069.80] I wouldn't pay anything.
[8069.90 → 8071.44] But some of those things are new features.
[8072.20 → 8072.70] Which ones?
[8072.70 → 8074.24] What if it's like DX12?
[8075.04 → 8076.32] But it's Windows XP.
[8078.88 → 8081.32] Like there's, there are new features involved.
[8081.74 → 8083.88] What if I wanted to run Windows XP software?
[8083.96 → 8088.50] They would just kind of like have unlimited support for every program written back to DOS.
[8089.28 → 8091.74] Kind of like, where are the bounds of this hypothetical?
[8092.60 → 8093.36] I don't know, guys.
[8093.40 → 8094.88] I think you might be overthinking a little bit.
[8095.32 → 8096.88] Let's say that everything works.
[8097.60 → 8100.54] And we just have a nebulous definition of what a feature is.
[8100.54 → 8102.94] Would you pay $30 a year to run?
[8103.14 → 8104.66] What would be, which is your favourite Windows?
[8104.80 → 8105.02] Seven?
[8106.68 → 8107.52] Probably seven.
[8107.52 → 8109.38] But I did use to run.
[8109.76 → 8110.74] I did use to run.
[8110.84 → 8111.44] Vista was hotter.
[8111.58 → 8112.68] I did use to run.
[8113.44 → 8113.84] Nice.
[8114.06 → 8115.42] Vista Black Edition.
[8116.02 → 8116.46] Nice.
[8116.66 → 8117.26] This was sick, dude.
[8117.26 → 8119.16] Once you go Vista Black, you never go back.
[8119.46 → 8122.86] This was so sick back in the day.
[8123.06 → 8130.52] So I could see, I could see me going for heavily modded versions by my, like I, so
[8130.52 → 8134.50] what I would do back in the day was I would get Black Edition, and then I would mod it significantly
[8134.50 → 8135.50] further beyond there.
[8136.14 → 8141.24] Heavily modded version of Vista or if I have to stick to like a more stock experience, I
[8141.24 → 8142.88] would go, yeah, seven for sure.
[8143.02 → 8144.04] I'm doing heavily modded seven.
[8144.04 → 8147.72] But I do not, under any circumstance, go beyond seven.
[8148.16 → 8150.82] And the main reason for that is telemetry and ads.
[8151.86 → 8152.30] Yep.
[8152.30 → 8154.14] And Windows 8 just sucked.
[8155.06 → 8157.92] 8.1 was like a lot better, but 8 was brutal.
[8159.36 → 8159.66] Ugh.
[8159.96 → 8161.32] And I hate the blocky design.
[8161.46 → 8162.96] So just, I'm just staying away from.
[8163.08 → 8163.62] That's fair.
[8163.74 → 8165.20] From 8 and 8.1.
[8165.42 → 8168.94] Anyway, the point is keep an eye out for some used hardware.
[8168.94 → 8173.40] If you're looking to build like a home theatre PC or a NAS or something like that, there are,
[8173.40 → 8177.44] to my knowledge, still workarounds to get around the TPM stuff for home use.
[8178.24 → 8182.84] Stats Counter noted that Windows 7 has apparently had a massive increase in market share.
[8182.84 → 8185.68] So that's pretty interesting.
[8186.14 → 8186.90] What has?
[8187.42 → 8188.42] Windows 7.
[8188.80 → 8189.16] Really?
[8189.46 → 8189.76] Yeah.
[8189.90 → 8190.08] Look at this.
[8190.08 → 8193.48] I guess if people are like, I'm not going to have security anyway, they're just going
[8193.48 → 8194.64] back to the better one.
[8194.84 → 8195.38] That's great.
[8195.66 → 8196.40] That's great.
[8198.14 → 8198.58] Yeah.
[8200.02 → 8204.18] I don't quite understand how that works, but you know what?
[8204.24 → 8205.32] I'm here for it.
[8205.40 → 8207.26] That's a really significant jump.
[8207.36 → 8208.00] Oh, dude.
[8208.00 → 8211.00] It's like, it was flat lined basically.
[8211.38 → 8211.60] Yeah.
[8211.82 → 8213.22] And then it's like, whoop.
[8213.32 → 8217.08] And it very clearly is coming out of Windows 10.
[8218.78 → 8219.22] Yeah.
[8219.36 → 8222.22] So I wonder if people are like, hey, if I'm not going to have support anyway, I'll just
[8222.22 → 8222.62] go back.
[8222.78 → 8223.08] Wild.
[8224.14 → 8224.98] Absolutely wild.
[8225.44 → 8227.50] You absolute mad lads, all of you.
[8229.08 → 8229.48] Okay.
[8232.04 → 8233.54] Windows 7 was so sick.
[8233.54 → 8236.06] Do you want to talk about OpenAI and Sora 2?
[8237.94 → 8238.34] Sure.
[8239.42 → 8241.06] OpenAI launches Sora app.
[8241.18 → 8241.56] This one?
[8241.86 → 8242.06] That one?
[8242.22 → 8243.00] That's the one you're talking about?
[8243.02 → 8243.64] Oh, it's moving.
[8244.08 → 8244.98] OpenAI launches Sora app.
[8245.04 → 8245.90] That's the topic you're talking about?
[8245.92 → 8246.02] Yeah.
[8246.22 → 8246.44] Okay.
[8246.68 → 8251.90] OpenAI launches Sora app, parental controls, and instant checkout, which is crazy.
[8252.36 → 8257.62] OpenAI has launched Sora 2, their new flagship video model, now featuring audio generation,
[8257.62 → 8265.26] exclusively available through their new invite-only, iOS-exclusive social app, also called Sora.
[8266.12 → 8268.78] The new model is notably better at simulating physics.
[8269.74 → 8274.94] OpenAI says that in its current state, it will be able to follow instructions that span
[8274.94 → 8280.62] multiple shots and simulate a consistent world state, which I can already tell you it
[8280.62 → 8281.56] doesn't really do.
[8281.86 → 8284.44] And we probably shouldn't listen to what they say things do at this point.
[8284.44 → 8290.64] But anyway, moving forward, the feature that caused the app to go viral this week was
[8290.64 → 8291.44] Cameos.
[8291.98 → 8292.36] What?
[8292.82 → 8294.06] Technically, they only said it can.
[8294.16 → 8295.78] They didn't say that they enabled that feature.
[8296.22 → 8297.30] Fair, fair, fair, fair, fair.
[8297.56 → 8298.58] Or that it will all the time.
[8299.88 → 8302.20] The feature that made it go viral was Cameos.
[8302.30 → 8307.96] Users can train the model to replicate their likeness, or just pretend they're someone else
[8307.96 → 8310.64] and train it to replicate that person's.
[8310.64 → 8315.42] And then choose whether to keep that ability to themselves or allow others to deepfake them
[8315.42 → 8316.14] as well.
[8316.30 → 8323.66] This led to social media being overwhelmed by videos of Sam Altman doing many things, including
[8323.66 → 8327.42] being dressed up as a kiddie man or stealing GPUs from Target.
[8328.50 → 8329.30] Are you loading those?
[8329.74 → 8330.00] Nope.
[8330.10 → 8333.34] I'm bringing up the creepy one that someone sent me.
[8333.72 → 8334.16] Okay.
[8335.50 → 8337.62] Here is him dressed as a kiddie man.
[8337.62 → 8338.62] Okay.
[8340.64 → 8341.64] Okay.
[8346.42 → 8347.64] And here's...
[8347.64 → 8350.24] I gave Sora the...
[8350.24 → 8350.54] Oh, boy.
[8350.64 → 8352.82] I mean, I can pretty easily tell it's not you, but...
[8352.82 → 8355.08] LTT logo and a simple prompt.
[8355.74 → 8358.38] The host of this narrating about Sora.
[8358.60 → 8359.22] What's the audio?
[8359.78 → 8363.40] Suspiciously got Linus Sebastian's voice and likeness just with blue eyes.
[8364.12 → 8364.86] Here we go.
[8364.90 → 8365.24] Ready, Dan?
[8365.24 → 8371.80] I've been blowing minds lately, but there's a lot more going on under the hood.
[8372.24 → 8373.92] It's not just stitching together frames.
[8374.38 → 8376.24] You probably know Sora as the tech...
[8376.24 → 8378.70] Yeah, so it's pretty extensively trained on you.
[8378.92 → 8379.16] Yep.
[8379.88 → 8380.30] Nice.
[8380.72 → 8381.20] That's cool.
[8381.84 → 8383.64] I'm happy they compensated you for that.
[8384.54 → 8384.92] Me too.
[8389.02 → 8392.94] Anyway, here's Sam Altman stealing GPUs and then getting caught for it.
[8392.94 → 8393.84] Okay.
[8395.24 → 8401.18] I'm not going to lie.
[8401.24 → 8401.62] Pretty good.
[8402.02 → 8402.36] Yep.
[8403.02 → 8405.84] Especially because we've known for a long time that like...
[8405.84 → 8406.74] Sam Altman needs more GPUs.
[8406.74 → 8407.50] Security camera footage.
[8407.66 → 8408.38] Yeah, that's true.
[8408.58 → 8410.46] Security camera footage or...
[8410.46 → 8413.28] I mean, it's the old like Bigfoot thing, right?
[8413.40 → 8413.58] Yep.
[8413.82 → 8416.74] It's always the worst camera at the worst angle and the worst lighting.
[8416.74 → 8416.96] Yep.
[8416.96 → 8421.98] Like, you do that, and it's hard to tell what's real and what isn't because the fidelity is so low.
[8423.64 → 8424.08] Anyway.
[8425.12 → 8430.68] At the moment, Sora 2 is limited to iOS and OpenAI said that they want to scale responsibly,
[8430.78 → 8437.40] giving users tools to control their feed and even default limits on how many generations teens can make.
[8437.40 → 8438.00] Okay.
[8439.14 → 8439.74] Sure.
[8440.12 → 8441.46] That's the main concern right now.
[8441.54 → 8442.02] Yeah.
[8442.56 → 8444.30] That's posturing for sure.
[8444.72 → 8450.98] Parental controls for Sora will be accessible through the ChatGPT app where general parental controls have been introduced as well.
[8451.36 → 8459.60] Parents just have to link their accounts and will have access to toggle features, set blackout hours, and receive notifications triggered by their teens' behaviour.
[8459.60 → 8465.68] The progression with parental controls is part of an ongoing effort to make ChatGPT helpful for everyone.
[8465.86 → 8466.66] Massive quotes.
[8467.32 → 8476.16] Eventually, OpenAI wants to be able to accurately predict the age of users so they can automatically block graphic content and potentially involve law enforcement.
[8476.30 → 8477.12] And also serve the meds.
[8477.58 → 8478.28] And if the...
[8478.28 → 8479.68] I added that last part myself.
[8480.02 → 8480.86] And if the kids...
[8480.86 → 8481.78] Yeah, absolutely.
[8481.98 → 8483.52] That's the core reason for sure.
[8483.58 → 8486.16] And if the kids really wanted the bad things, they would just run it locally.
[8486.16 → 8497.06] OpenAI elaborated saying that it will only contact law enforcement in rare emergencies when their system detects a teen is in a moment of acute distress and their parent cannot be reached.
[8497.78 → 8498.26] Okay.
[8498.54 → 8498.82] Yeah.
[8499.30 → 8499.70] That...
[8499.70 → 8500.92] I'm just throwing that out there.
[8500.98 → 8501.82] That might be too late.
[8503.84 → 8505.34] Acute distress is...
[8505.34 → 8506.44] Just a little bit too late.
[8506.54 → 8506.74] Yeah.
[8506.86 → 8510.38] Not a good time to necessarily do that.
[8510.80 → 8512.10] A lot a bit too late.
[8512.10 → 8517.50] OpenAI is also automating and open sourcing instant checkouts with ChatGPT.
[8518.84 → 8527.12] Allowing all US customers to buy single item purchases from US Etsy sellers and with more Shopify based sellers to come later.
[8527.36 → 8527.74] Oh, okay.
[8527.82 → 8528.50] So hold on a second.
[8528.60 → 8532.08] People could buy an LTT screwdriver on ChatGPT?
[8532.94 → 8534.92] I don't know if they can yet.
[8535.26 → 8537.80] And I don't know if this has to be like an opt-in thing.
[8537.96 → 8538.86] I would opt into that.
[8539.06 → 8539.70] Why not?
[8539.74 → 8540.32] I'm not going to lie.
[8540.32 → 8549.40] I mean, if people are going to give all of their information to OpenAI and OpenAI is going to use it to advertise stuff on Shopify.
[8550.48 → 8552.64] I wonder if you have to have an affiliate program for them.
[8552.76 → 8555.38] They probably wouldn't start that way, but I wouldn't be surprised if we got there eventually.
[8555.38 → 8556.58] I wouldn't be surprised if we got there.
[8556.90 → 8557.10] Yeah.
[8557.30 → 8558.42] Or if you had...
[8558.42 → 8563.14] I mean, Musk already said the quiet part out loud about KAI where he was just like,
[8563.20 → 8567.12] yeah, and wouldn't it be great if brands could just pay us to recommend their products?
[8567.20 → 8567.64] Remember that?
[8568.28 → 8568.56] Yeah.
[8568.56 → 8575.12] So I wouldn't be surprised if that has been a very active conversation in the AI chatbot community.
[8575.12 → 8577.38] Apparently you have to allow it from the Shopify side.
[8577.98 → 8579.84] I mean, we would definitely turn this on.
[8579.92 → 8580.26] So we should do that.
[8580.94 → 8581.12] Yeah.
[8583.52 → 8584.22] Comrades here.
[8584.38 → 8585.58] Hey, you can do it now.
[8585.68 → 8585.96] Subcom.
[8586.22 → 8589.24] Instant checkout isn't reaching into your wallet.
[8589.24 → 8595.80] It's just adding a buy button and embedding the checkout process into your ChatGPT chat for products that support it.
[8595.80 → 8602.40] Instant checkout uses their agentic commerce protocol or ACP, which was co-developed with Stripe.
[8602.40 → 8603.96] That makes sense.
[8604.36 → 8611.86] Every step of the process requires explicit confirmations and payments are encrypted and only authorized for specific amounts.
[8611.86 → 8612.72] Okay.
[8612.72 → 8620.96] I'm waiting for a future where we have a listener bot of sorts in various live chats.
[8620.96 → 8628.02] And then you announce some product on WAN show and people just type buy, and it just does it.
[8628.02 → 8632.18] Anyway, moving forward.
[8632.30 → 8638.80] Actually, I've got a sort of semi, maybe kind of related topic of conversation.
[8638.80 → 8645.34] So we've talked, I think, a fair bit in the past about buy now, pay later schemas.
[8645.34 → 8651.30] Um, and this came into my inbox earlier today.
[8652.20 → 8654.58] Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[8654.66 → 8654.86] Okay.
[8654.88 → 8660.92] So I, I sent this to the CW team a few days ago about Shopify and the ChatGPT integrations.
[8661.22 → 8670.52] And then, um, I got, uh, I got an email from Dave, and he goes, uh, Hey, so just following up with you.
[8671.24 → 8673.46] Um, oh, wait.
[8674.18 → 8674.64] Yes.
[8675.34 → 8675.96] Uh, okay.
[8676.02 → 8676.16] Yeah.
[8676.16 → 8676.30] Yeah.
[8676.30 → 8677.20] It looks like this is public.
[8677.42 → 8677.82] Sorry.
[8677.94 → 8678.60] I almost said something.
[8678.68 → 8680.16] I thought I might say something that's not public.
[8680.52 → 8682.08] Uh, so Dave sent me this email.
[8682.14 → 8689.40] He goes, Hey, following up per our Shopify contacts, it sounds like their team is very slowly rolling access out to stores on a limited basis.
[8689.84 → 8691.40] I, oh, wait, no, this is a different thing.
[8691.44 → 8691.88] Hold on.
[8692.12 → 8692.82] Uh, let's see.
[8692.82 → 8693.48] I'll need something.
[8693.60 → 8694.90] Do you want me to take it?
[8695.70 → 8696.48] Uh, yeah.
[8696.62 → 8697.80] Why can't I not find the right email?
[8697.80 → 8701.16] So PayPal is enabling buy now, pay later for like everything.
[8701.70 → 8703.92] I don't even think it's opt in or opt out.
[8703.92 → 8708.84] PayPal is just like allowing this now, which does make sense in regard to how PayPal works.
[8709.40 → 8718.94] Um, and then Shopify, as far as my understanding goes, is doing an opt-in setup where by now, pay later is not enabled by default, but stores can opt into it.
[8718.94 → 8719.30] Yeah.
[8719.38 → 8724.14] If we're being effectively forced into complying with this whole concept from PayPal anyway.
[8724.80 → 8727.08] Um, what do you think we should do?
[8727.22 → 8728.88] I think that was effectively the question.
[8729.02 → 8729.24] Yeah.
[8730.14 → 8730.72] Oh yeah.
[8730.84 → 8731.58] Here's my email.
[8731.66 → 8739.42] Why didn't I just read my email from Dave's email below related note, both shop and PayPal are pitching payment plan solutions for consumers.
[8739.42 → 8743.34] Uh, PayPal is rolling regardless of whether we market it shop is an opt-in.
[8743.42 → 8745.76] Do you have any feelings about payment plans for customers?
[8745.76 → 8750.70] And what I said was Luke and I have been pretty vocal critics of buy now, pay later schemes on when shown.
[8750.78 → 8756.82] It seems like we are being forced to have it at this point, regardless, should we discuss on when, what should be our policy regarding this tech?
[8756.82 → 8763.66] If it's supported through PayPal anyway, should we provide customer choice on our site for how to engage with this payment method?
[8763.94 → 8766.44] And, uh, both Luke and Taryn responded.
[8766.58 → 8768.66] So you do just want to say what you said.
[8769.26 → 8770.34] Um, yeah, effectively.
[8770.34 → 8771.80] I didn't actually read your email yet.
[8771.92 → 8772.12] So.
[8772.34 → 8775.42] Oh, why do I even send them?
[8775.50 → 8777.22] Well, because I'm going to read it eventually.
[8778.12 → 8779.00] I was trolling.
[8779.46 → 8784.50] Um, yeah, I had a weird, I had a not weird.
[8784.58 → 8785.76] I had a surprising encounter.
[8785.76 → 8790.48] I was, I was trolling about Klarna, which is one of the more well-known buy now, pay later solutions.
[8790.78 → 8792.34] You know, buying a banana with Klarna or whatever.
[8792.48 → 8792.58] Yeah.
[8792.64 → 8792.86] Yeah.
[8793.12 → 8794.94] Um, but, but there's a ton of them.
[8795.00 → 8802.48] It's not just Klarna, but I was trolling about that in a chat that had a Swedish person living in Sweden in it.
[8802.58 → 8803.02] Yeah.
[8803.26 → 8808.82] And that person pointed out like, Hey bro, it's actually like totally normal and kind of fine here.
[8809.44 → 8811.18] I was like, what?
[8811.18 → 8815.60] And they just apparently use it as a credit card replacement.
[8815.80 → 8816.20] Yeah.
[8816.20 → 8817.30] And it's very normal.
[8817.30 → 8822.12] And a lot of people just have debit cards, and then they use Klarna, which is a Swedish company, by the way.
[8822.46 → 8825.92] Um, so it started there as a credit card replacement.
[8826.34 → 8838.54] Um, and delinquencies, delinquencies and defaults in like Sweden and Norway, where it was originally popularized is like way lower than elsewhere.
[8838.54 → 8840.78] Just like have a different relationship with it.
[8840.80 → 8847.86] And that may be kind of just fall back on like, I don't know.
[8847.86 → 8853.90] So I think our CEO, Baron Tong had probably the most based take on this.
[8854.16 → 8857.12] He says, credit cards are also onerous.
[8857.24 → 8859.12] If you miss payments, we accept those.
[8859.32 → 8862.64] My position is being financially literate.
[8862.64 → 8871.30] If you're using this to borrow money and don't have the ability to pay it off within terms, you probably shouldn't be making the purchase.
[8871.62 → 8873.48] My take on it was freedom reigns.
[8873.82 → 8875.00] Let them do it if they want.
[8875.96 → 8877.28] I don't, I don't.
[8877.28 → 8877.96] Oh, right.
[8878.04 → 8891.32] We never actually clarified the part about why we have some discomfort because the way that the relationship that people have, some people have with these buy now pay later schemes is not a healthy one.
[8891.32 → 8895.84] And it can seem to encourage unhealthy spending habits.
[8896.04 → 8897.12] There is literally people.
[8897.88 → 8904.16] This is more common in the Americas, maybe not so common in Sweden and Norway and the world is not the same and Ada, Ada, Ada.
[8905.40 → 8911.74] But there are apparently people that max out their credit cards, don't have any credit card room left.
[8913.14 → 8915.04] And then go to something like Klarna.
[8915.36 → 8917.32] And that's crazy.
[8918.32 → 8918.76] That's terrifying.
[8919.34 → 8920.16] Please no.
[8920.16 → 8923.96] People are saying Klarna will cut you off real quick if you don't pay.
[8924.14 → 8925.00] I have no idea.
[8926.20 → 8926.84] I don't know.
[8927.08 → 8928.04] I don't like it.
[8928.08 → 8933.56] As someone who had credit cards extremely normalized, which is a North American thing.
[8933.70 → 8933.94] Yep.
[8934.54 → 8938.30] This sounds just like bad extension of credit card.
[8938.54 → 8938.70] Yeah.
[8938.80 → 8939.50] It sounds like.
[8939.80 → 8941.30] I also understand it's different around the world.
[8941.64 → 8943.04] It sounds like.
[8943.04 → 8945.92] Why does it bother me?
[8945.92 → 8948.64] Because, yeah, they both are functionally the same.
[8948.72 → 8950.82] They are both literally buy now, pay later.
[8950.96 → 8958.04] So maybe it's because I assume that I am buying something with a credit card.
[8958.26 → 8962.84] So I assume there should be no reason that I need a buy now, pay later.
[8962.84 → 8963.84] Credit card.
[8963.88 → 8964.52] Does that make sense?
[8964.64 → 8964.78] Because.
[8964.78 → 8966.10] Is like one month.
[8966.46 → 8967.94] Klarna is many months.
[8968.76 → 8969.34] But see.
[8969.56 → 8969.80] And that.
[8969.92 → 8970.34] But that.
[8970.48 → 8970.68] Okay.
[8970.80 → 8970.96] But.
[8971.18 → 8971.96] Is that the difference?
[8972.16 → 8972.62] Well, hold on.
[8972.64 → 8973.38] There are two differences.
[8973.54 → 8973.66] Okay.
[8973.70 → 8973.86] Okay.
[8973.90 → 8974.10] Okay.
[8974.10 → 8981.02] So through my North American lens, like literally almost nobody here uses a debit card to pay for
[8981.02 → 8981.60] something online.
[8981.60 → 8983.88] Like I don't, I don't, I don't even know if we can.
[8984.24 → 8986.92] You could use email money transfer.
[8987.70 → 8992.26] There are, there are ways to use debit cards for online payments, but it's like really unnatural
[8992.26 → 8992.60] and.
[8992.76 → 8993.06] Yeah.
[8993.26 → 8998.32] So, so, so the functionally speaking, if you're buying something online as a North American,
[8998.32 → 9004.36] you are using a credit card, or you are using your PayPal account, which is probably linked
[9004.36 → 9008.08] to a credit card or can be linked to a bank account.
[9008.08 → 9013.26] But that from my understanding is exceedingly uncommon compared to just using a credit card.
[9013.42 → 9019.36] So maybe part of our ice around stuff like around buy now, pay later, like Klarna is that
[9019.36 → 9022.82] we assume that you're already using a credit card.
[9022.96 → 9030.94] So there should be, unless you are being financially very irresponsible, no reason to use a buy now,
[9031.02 → 9033.98] pay later scheme because you are already using a buy now, pay later scheme.
[9033.98 → 9039.92] My first few exposures to it were discussions where people were talking about how they can
[9039.92 → 9044.32] still order things like Uber Eats, even when they've maxed out their credit cards.
[9044.74 → 9047.98] Those were the first few exposures I had to it.
[9048.06 → 9052.12] Not one, like all of them for like months.
[9052.38 → 9053.32] And so then.
[9053.38 → 9054.62] Was people talking about that.
[9054.62 → 9062.92] Part of it too then could be our cultural experience of living in a place where credit
[9062.92 → 9069.20] cards themselves too are something to be treated extremely cautiously, where we know that they
[9069.20 → 9070.36] are not used responsibly.
[9070.46 → 9075.60] And one of the reasons that is often cited for people to have trouble controlling their
[9075.60 → 9083.72] spending with a credit card is that it has no discernible change in weight or size when
[9083.72 → 9085.70] you use it, you know, like cash does.
[9086.52 → 9089.72] So it can be, it can be hard for some people to keep track of it.
[9090.34 → 9097.92] So to me, something that you pay over an even longer period of time would seem to me to compound
[9097.92 → 9099.52] potentially that problem.
[9099.52 → 9099.72] I agree.
[9099.86 → 9105.28] It's like that whole thing where like, oh, you buy a you buy a couch, and it's $0 down
[9105.28 → 9107.02] 0% interest for three years.
[9107.14 → 9108.92] It's like, why does that model work?
[9108.92 → 9111.00] Because they're going to get interest from it.
[9111.00 → 9111.68] Because it crushes people.
[9111.78 → 9115.58] Because it has a 30% interest when you don't have it paid off in three years.
[9115.58 → 9119.46] And you're going to forget about it because it's three years later, and then you just get
[9119.46 → 9119.92] slammed.
[9120.04 → 9123.24] People can afford $300 for the couch they want now.
[9124.22 → 9126.18] They can't afford $3,000.
[9126.18 → 9133.24] And instead of just buying a $300 couch, they want the one that they can technically afford
[9133.24 → 9135.12] because they have an extra 300 bucks every month.
[9135.60 → 9140.72] D Jenner in float plane chat says, so you guys support the payment processor censoring game
[9140.72 → 9141.16] purchases.
[9142.28 → 9145.40] It is not your responsibility to police the way other people spend money.
[9145.50 → 9147.64] If I want to pay later to gamble, that's my issue.
[9147.72 → 9148.98] Just don't promote these things.
[9148.98 → 9152.98] Well now hold on just a gosh darn second here because putting the logo on our website
[9152.98 → 9154.66] is promoting it.
[9155.40 → 9156.32] So that's one thing.
[9157.06 → 9164.46] And there is a degree of corporate responsibility for not engaging in things that have the potential
[9164.46 → 9165.68] to be predatory.
[9166.48 → 9166.64] Right?
[9166.72 → 9171.52] Like the whole thing where a third party that was nothing to do with the transaction.
[9171.78 → 9171.98] Right?
[9172.04 → 9181.44] In those cases, the payment processors were interfering and through outside influence groups were putting
[9181.44 → 9186.14] their own moral values on a transaction that was taking place between the first two parties.
[9186.24 → 9190.94] So we have a fourth party influencing a third party to influence the second party when you're
[9190.94 → 9191.86] just trying to buy something.
[9192.02 → 9195.40] That is not the same thing at all.
[9195.64 → 9196.62] That's not the same thing at all.
[9196.62 → 9203.82] In this case, we have two parties and one is deciding whether to implement a payment processor
[9203.82 → 9207.40] that can potentially be harmful.
[9207.40 → 9215.20] Like, I think that it's a very slippery slope to say, well, corporations should just implement
[9215.20 → 9215.80] whatever.
[9216.10 → 9221.90] And if people can't use it responsibly, then like whatever, that's on them.
[9221.90 → 9228.20] Because I think as soon as we start to say something like that, well, like why even have
[9228.20 → 9229.92] warning labels on cigarettes?
[9229.92 → 9233.46] Because, you know, they're adults, it's their bodies, it's their right to do whatever they
[9233.46 → 9233.66] want.
[9233.66 → 9238.06] And it's like, well, like, yeah, but the whole reason that we have warnings, the whole reason
[9238.06 → 9243.48] that people get the ice around the mobile gaming industry, for instance, is that it can
[9243.48 → 9244.28] be very targeted.
[9244.42 → 9245.62] It can be very exploitative.
[9246.24 → 9250.26] And we are aspiring here to not behave like that.
[9250.90 → 9251.78] That's a good thing.
[9253.34 → 9260.08] We're not interfering in two other parties' business and pushing our own sort of moral
[9260.08 → 9260.54] value.
[9260.54 → 9263.00] We're just trying to operate our business with integrity.
[9263.76 → 9273.02] The thing that kind of shifted my stance on a little bit was talking to people in Sweden,
[9273.16 → 9273.44] essentially.
[9273.80 → 9274.94] More than one.
[9275.48 → 9276.36] I talked to a few.
[9276.78 → 9278.76] And they're all like, yeah, what are you even talking about?
[9278.80 → 9279.56] This is super normal.
[9280.30 → 9281.58] And not just super normal.
[9281.68 → 9283.60] This is just like how you buy things.
[9283.60 → 9287.48] I was like, okay.
[9287.92 → 9288.54] I don't know.
[9289.62 → 9291.22] I just was unaware.
[9291.58 → 9297.62] And I think it still doesn't make me comfortable with it, but I'm also not completely comfortable
[9297.62 → 9298.24] with credit cards.
[9298.32 → 9304.06] I mean, we've talked on WAN Show about the insufficient fund errors on flow plane going up.
[9304.92 → 9305.94] That's uncomfortable.
[9305.94 → 9307.80] I don't like that.
[9307.88 → 9308.58] Don't do that.
[9308.58 → 9312.92] And I think we just need to say the same thing about buy now, pay later.
[9313.86 → 9317.96] Which is like, don't do it if you can't pay sooner than later.
[9321.46 → 9321.94] Personally.
[9323.10 → 9323.66] But I don't know.
[9323.66 → 9329.82] Because just because there are, this feels like geographical to me.
[9331.28 → 9336.20] Because like literally, like if I look up, there are more.
[9338.06 → 9342.38] Stay the path asks, LMFAO, thanks guys.
[9342.58 → 9346.08] I'm still not clear if Canadians use credit at all?
[9346.34 → 9347.52] Question mark, question mark, question mark.
[9347.74 → 9351.54] Like, do you guys only buy stuff when you can pay for all of it up front right then?
[9351.54 → 9352.02] Yes.
[9354.58 → 9356.46] That's not all Canadians, actually.
[9356.86 → 9363.46] One of the reasons that there's a high degree of awareness around this topic for us is that
[9363.46 → 9367.14] Canadian household debt is, I believe, at an all-time high right now.
[9367.78 → 9377.04] And it's a major issue for us as a Canadian society to try to figure out how to tackle and
[9377.04 → 9378.14] shift our culture on.
[9378.14 → 9385.36] But for, I speak for me and Luke personally, and I think I heard Dan pipe up back there,
[9385.44 → 9387.28] but I was not already aware of that for Dan.
[9388.06 → 9388.78] What was that, sorry?
[9388.94 → 9390.46] One hundred f***ING percent.
[9390.68 → 9396.66] Yeah, no, I have never made a discretionary purchase if I don't have cash.
[9397.00 → 9398.04] You've got to be kidding me.
[9398.48 → 9402.16] Yeah, and I use credit cards for literally every purchase ever.
[9402.42 → 9402.78] Yeah, me too.
[9402.86 → 9404.62] And I always treat it like it's cash.
[9404.62 → 9405.18] Yeah.
[9405.18 → 9405.36] Yeah.
[9405.68 → 9408.10] Every purchase goes into a spreadsheet at the end of the month.
[9408.30 → 9408.62] Absolutely.
[9408.78 → 9412.56] And to be clear, there are healthier types of loan.
[9412.76 → 9420.42] Like, while the housing market in Vancouver was going gang busters, like, people would take
[9420.42 → 9423.90] the equity that they had built up in their home because the value had gone up so much,
[9423.90 → 9429.04] and they might take some of that money out of it as an additional loan versus the mortgage
[9429.04 → 9431.66] they originally took out to, you know, do a renovation on the house.
[9431.66 → 9435.60] But the idea being that, well, the value of the property is going to go up so much anyway
[9435.60 → 9438.08] that by the time you sell it, it's basically free real estate.
[9438.58 → 9441.16] Like, and that was at a much lower interest rate.
[9441.16 → 9446.66] Um, or like, for example, my parents, um, they often, they had a line of credit that we would
[9446.66 → 9451.32] often have to use in August because they were both educators and weren't being paid in the
[9451.32 → 9451.54] summer.
[9452.14 → 9456.62] And, um, some teachers do take on summer jobs, but they didn't.
[9456.72 → 9459.44] They took care of us kids in the summer because they had five of us.
[9459.56 → 9464.94] Um, and so, you know, yeah, we would dip into a line of credit from time to time.
[9464.94 → 9469.24] But in terms of like, like we're talking about credit cards and buy now, pay later here, guys,
[9469.24 → 9471.26] we're talking stuff with like crazy interest rates.
[9471.26 → 9476.76] Like I don't, I don't, I don't want to give any financial institution a penny of interest
[9476.76 → 9477.54] if I don't have to.
[9477.60 → 9478.14] Why would I?
[9478.14 → 9479.34] I just think the thing that's...
[9479.34 → 9480.22] I'll buy a GPU later.
[9480.48 → 9482.12] The thing that's shifting my mind.
[9482.58 → 9482.82] Yeah.
[9482.94 → 9487.56] Uh, the first shift was talking to Swedish people and just being like, oh, okay, interesting.
[9487.72 → 9489.38] And then I started looking into it more.
[9489.54 → 9494.92] And then I started hearing people talk about the, the, the term by now, pay later.
[9495.48 → 9497.98] And it's just, it's just credit with a different shirt on.
[9498.22 → 9498.58] Well, yeah.
[9498.98 → 9499.16] Yeah.
[9499.16 → 9500.32] They're micro loans basically.
[9500.70 → 9501.94] But that's what credit cards are.
[9502.28 → 9502.80] So like...
[9502.80 → 9503.02] Yeah.
[9503.30 → 9507.50] I, well, that's kind of why I said earlier, like it's at one month versus like six months.
[9507.80 → 9513.64] Cause you know, uh, Visa pays for my purchases for less than a month or one month.
[9514.08 → 9518.18] Um, I guess Klarna is paying for your purchases for six months.
[9518.38 → 9520.24] Like, I think, I think it's the same thing.
[9520.32 → 9522.70] I'm trying to figure out why I'm so put off by it.
[9522.70 → 9528.56] I think, I think we are having the same sort of gut reaction, which is this month I have
[9528.56 → 9530.36] $3,000 to buy a GPU.
[9531.04 → 9533.86] So I'm going to buy that GPU because I have $3,000.
[9534.06 → 9534.96] I'll put it on my credit card.
[9535.54 → 9539.90] Um, I would really like this GPU, but I only have $500.
[9539.90 → 9542.58] So I'm going to split that over four months.
[9543.20 → 9543.50] Mm-hmm.
[9544.06 → 9545.10] You only have $500.
[9545.40 → 9547.26] Maybe you shouldn't buy that GPU.
[9547.38 → 9548.58] Maybe it's better to save.
[9548.66 → 9553.66] Or you should buy that GPU, but you should buy it in four months after you have saved it
[9553.66 → 9554.48] up ahead of time.
[9554.62 → 9557.22] Maybe they're trying to capture a deal, something like that.
[9557.22 → 9563.54] But I think the stuff like Klarna for somebody like myself promotes bad spending habits.
[9563.88 → 9567.50] And I think it's designed to promote bad spending habits.
[9567.76 → 9568.42] But so are credit cards.
[9568.42 → 9570.08] Because not necessarily.
[9570.28 → 9572.20] This is more advanced than that.
[9572.20 → 9573.02] They absolutely are.
[9573.30 → 9577.22] Klarna is like sucrose, whereas, um, credit cards are sugar.
[9577.22 → 9581.94] Um, it's way easier to pay $20 now than it is to pay $200.
[9582.36 → 9584.98] And you pay $20 on top of it.
[9585.22 → 9587.90] So your bills every single month blossom.
[9588.06 → 9592.88] I see what Dan means, where by the time you start to realize how deep you are in it,
[9593.40 → 9594.84] you're, you could be deeper in it.
[9594.92 → 9596.32] This happens with credit cards.
[9596.40 → 9597.06] Oh yeah, it does.
[9597.14 → 9599.88] And this is a more advanced version of that.
[9599.88 → 9601.08] And with credit cards, you're paying $0 up front.
[9601.22 → 9605.30] No, no, I, I totally understand what you're saying, but I also understand Dan's point.
[9605.30 → 9606.86] This is just that, but worse.
[9607.22 → 9609.24] And, and it's, it's only worse.
[9609.50 → 9609.98] Hold on.
[9610.30 → 9611.58] It's only worse.
[9611.76 → 9611.86] Just.
[9612.50 → 9613.60] Because you understand it's the same.
[9613.74 → 9616.18] It is, but it's also could be worse.
[9616.20 → 9616.50] Okay.
[9616.64 → 9618.16] Because we got to understand that.
[9618.16 → 9618.50] It's more insidious.
[9618.66 → 9620.36] Not every person is going.
[9620.48 → 9621.56] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[9621.64 → 9622.48] Dan, wait.
[9622.68 → 9623.96] Let me, let me break through.
[9624.06 → 9624.22] All right.
[9624.22 → 9625.50] Because he's got a bit of a mental block here.
[9625.52 → 9626.24] I'm new at this.
[9626.30 → 9627.66] I think I know what the problem is.
[9627.68 → 9628.46] Okay, good, good, good.
[9628.46 → 9635.28] So, so the point that Dan is trying to make is that with a service that extends it by such
[9635.28 → 9636.82] a lengthy period of time.
[9637.16 → 9644.32] There is a potentially such a long delay between when you made the initial decision and when
[9644.32 → 9649.36] the negative impact hits you that you may have had much more time to make compounding
[9649.36 → 9651.24] negative decisions in that time.
[9651.24 → 9653.14] Whereas your credit card bill arrives every month.
[9653.36 → 9659.74] So it's kind of like if you had multiple credit cards that you were using to pay each credit
[9659.74 → 9664.24] card, and you only realized what a problem it was by the time your last credit card was due.
[9664.40 → 9666.14] Is I think what you're trying to say, Dan.
[9666.20 → 9666.32] Yeah.
[9666.32 → 9667.44] I get a big bill.
[9667.70 → 9669.92] Except the credit cards also have minimum payments, which is what like a lot of people do.
[9669.92 → 9669.94] Yeah, okay.
[9669.94 → 9670.12] They do.
[9670.20 → 9671.48] But you're paying off your Klarna.
[9671.56 → 9672.22] But you have to look at it.
[9672.22 → 9673.16] You're paying off your credit card.
[9673.22 → 9674.16] You're paying off your Klarna.
[9674.70 → 9676.48] Every single month I get this big bill.
[9676.62 → 9677.88] I pay off my big bill.
[9677.88 → 9682.50] But when I'm looking at a purchase, and I'm staring down this GPU, and it's $3,000, I'm
[9682.50 → 9684.52] making an internal decision.
[9684.68 → 9686.96] Do I really want to hand over $3,000 right now?
[9687.32 → 9691.80] If all the purchases that I'm doing throughout the day are, oh, this is only 20 bucks, right?
[9691.84 → 9693.18] My GPU only cost me $100.
[9694.42 → 9695.76] And then I go to another store.
[9695.86 → 9697.12] Oh, this is only going to cost me $100.
[9697.44 → 9698.58] This is only 50 bucks.
[9698.90 → 9699.46] Oh, hold on.
[9699.54 → 9702.24] My DoorDash, instead of being 15 bucks, that cost me $2.
[9702.44 → 9705.72] And then Luke's point is it could be just as insidious if it's $0.
[9706.24 → 9707.64] Yes, exactly the same thing.
[9707.64 → 9707.68] No.
[9707.94 → 9709.14] Okay, they're not exactly.
[9709.32 → 9709.50] No.
[9709.76 → 9711.00] Because of minimum payments.
[9711.18 → 9714.16] It's about the hint to.
[9714.16 → 9717.42] I don't think everyone sees it the way that you happen to be seeing it right now.
[9717.42 → 9719.14] Depending on your psychological profile.
[9719.40 → 9722.78] I think one or the other could absolutely be worse.
[9722.94 → 9723.30] Yes.
[9723.64 → 9727.88] And so I think that's an important thing for us to all kind of capture here.
[9727.96 → 9728.40] For sure.
[9728.40 → 9734.92] And I think that my gut reaction came from I saw Klarna as on top of credit cards.
[9734.92 → 9735.44] Me too.
[9735.44 → 9739.38] Which is maybe why I saw it as the more evil of the two.
[9739.54 → 9745.06] But I also see your point that if either are being used independently, they are functionally the same thing.
[9745.14 → 9747.98] Because with minimum payments.
[9748.08 → 9748.82] Yes, I get it.
[9748.92 → 9749.70] It's the same thing.
[9749.70 → 9751.32] I think they probably want us to move on.
[9751.38 → 9752.56] But there's one more quick thing.
[9752.66 → 9755.46] Booker says, come on Linus, kids come out of college in six figure debt.
[9755.66 → 9759.14] So the difference there was I had a really great summer job.
[9759.40 → 9763.76] I ran a painting business with a similar thing to College Pro.
[9763.76 → 9767.02] And so I came out of school with no debt.
[9767.94 → 9774.92] So when I say I have saved up ahead of time for every major purchase in my life, I do mean that.
[9775.42 → 9779.90] And I've been very lucky to be able to do that.
[9779.98 → 9782.70] I was able to live at home while I was going to school.
[9782.74 → 9783.72] That made a big difference.
[9784.10 → 9786.92] I mean, I commuted four and a half hours a day or whatever.
[9787.04 → 9789.22] So there were definitely downsides.
[9790.36 → 9792.78] And I got some help from my parents as well.
[9792.78 → 9795.92] They paid for half of my first car, if I recall correctly.
[9796.12 → 9798.28] So that was a couple of thousand dollars, actually.
[9798.36 → 9799.00] It was a cheap car.
[9799.08 → 9802.48] But it moved from point A to point B, which was what I needed.
[9803.46 → 9804.62] There was more to the deal.
[9804.86 → 9807.18] My mom was also going back for another degree.
[9807.50 → 9810.70] And so I drove her as well as part of...
[9810.70 → 9812.96] It was a multifaceted deal.
[9813.04 → 9818.16] The point is just that, no, that is a thing.
[9818.32 → 9821.28] Saving up before you buy something is definitely a thing.
[9821.28 → 9828.48] And that was one of the reasons that I have and even continue to shop secondhand.
[9828.86 → 9830.06] Because it's cheaper.
[9830.58 → 9833.86] And because then you don't have to save for as long.
[9833.98 → 9835.06] The hunt is also kind of fun.
[9835.28 → 9836.12] The hunt is fun.
[9836.24 → 9837.28] Not everybody's into it.
[9838.12 → 9839.18] Not everybody's into it.
[9839.18 → 9848.56] Crystal says, you also didn't finish college.
[9848.64 → 9850.52] You also live in a country where that's actually feasible.
[9850.72 → 9851.38] Not anymore.
[9851.92 → 9854.10] So that's a thing that's changed, right?
[9854.26 → 9857.80] And to be clear, none of what I'm talking about had anything to do with student loan debt.
[9857.94 → 9859.26] I didn't mention student loan debt.
[9859.60 → 9867.44] That is something that, depending on the program that you're going into, depending on the return that you might expect from it, could make sense.
[9867.44 → 9871.34] Because Yvonne's education made a lot of sense.
[9873.16 → 9877.80] And one of the reasons that we were able to pay for her education was that I did drop out.
[9878.38 → 9884.32] And I contributed to her education, even though that probably didn't make sense for where we were at in our relationship at the time.
[9884.40 → 9885.76] But she seemed like the one.
[9885.90 → 9887.14] And it seemed like a good idea.
[9887.28 → 9888.38] And it paid off just fine.
[9889.14 → 9891.64] So make of that what you will.
[9891.64 → 9907.68] But it's obviously a discussion that is creating a lot of, generating a lot of emotions in viewers right now.
[9908.08 → 9913.58] And we were basically just looking to kind of take your temperature on this whole buy now, pay later.
[9913.58 → 9920.42] It seems like, in general, people are pretty aligned on what's the difference at this point.
[9922.56 → 9924.02] So, I don't know.
[9926.60 → 9928.22] Maybe we'll talk about it some more.
[9928.48 → 9929.34] Yeah, Angry Panda.
[9929.60 → 9930.92] It's been an interesting discussion.
[9930.92 → 9931.84] I don't know if there's more to say.
[9932.04 → 9932.68] If nothing else.
[9933.70 → 9935.12] Yeah, maybe there is nothing more to say.
[9935.22 → 9938.56] I mean, are you just, are just like whatever at this point?
[9938.78 → 9939.52] Do a capitalism.
[9939.80 → 9940.34] Turn it on.
[9940.94 → 9941.92] I don't, I don't like.
[9943.88 → 9944.70] Consumer choice?
[9945.70 → 9946.94] That's kind of where I'm sitting.
[9947.08 → 9948.02] I don't like it.
[9948.06 → 9949.44] But if you want to do it, sure.
[9949.60 → 9950.60] Because you don't use credit cards.
[9950.66 → 9951.56] I use credit cards for everything.
[9951.80 → 9953.16] I use credit cards for everything.
[9953.50 → 9957.20] Archive and Float plane Chat may have come into the conversation a little bit later and says,
[9957.20 → 9959.10] You don't have a choice in taking credit cards.
[9959.28 → 9962.08] And you don't have a choice if someone signs up for one.
[9962.30 → 9964.84] But you do have a choice in enabling buy now, pay later.
[9965.18 → 9967.84] Someone could sign up for a predatory service because you offered it.
[9967.84 → 9972.78] So you might have missed the part earlier in the conversation where we don't have a choice.
[9972.90 → 9974.86] PayPal is just pushing it.
[9975.34 → 9976.42] It will be enabled.
[9976.96 → 9977.56] That's it.
[9977.96 → 9982.62] So buy now, pay later will be enabled on our site regardless at this point.
[9983.94 → 9987.38] And that's the reason that we're even having the conversation at all.
[9987.38 → 9988.18] That's what sparked it.
[9988.30 → 9988.44] Yeah.
[9988.44 → 9992.38] All right.
[9992.82 → 9995.40] But it's also like, I don't know if that's a...
[9995.40 → 9997.62] This whole thing, it comes down to perspectives.
[9997.62 → 9999.88] Because like, I understand what you and Dan are saying.
[10000.00 → 10003.06] But I think there is an archetype of person who won't see it that way.
[10003.12 → 10004.06] That's my core argument.
[10005.98 → 10006.98] That's the problem.
[10007.18 → 10007.50] And...
[10007.50 → 10008.88] Sorry?
[10009.32 → 10011.18] That's the problem that they don't see it like that.
[10011.34 → 10011.94] No, for sure.
[10011.94 → 10015.80] That's why they end up in horrible cyclical debt forever.
[10016.00 → 10017.76] This is like not a good thing at all.
[10017.94 → 10024.88] And I think these micro multi-month loan things encourage that more than a credit card.
[10025.30 → 10027.06] See, I don't necessarily agree.
[10027.28 → 10028.98] Anyway, we're getting really cyclical on that.
[10028.98 → 10030.20] But it doesn't matter because...
[10030.20 → 10030.52] That's fine.
[10031.54 → 10034.28] It's going to be different for different people.
[10034.94 → 10037.32] And I think that Dan can be right, and you can also be right.
[10037.40 → 10037.78] I think so.
[10037.78 → 10040.42] So I think that particular argument doesn't matter.
[10040.42 → 10041.28] So I'm trying to move on from there.
[10041.54 → 10045.54] My point is that by having a checkout that shows that it's compatible with certain things,
[10045.54 → 10046.92] I think it's exactly the same.
[10047.36 → 10047.62] Right.
[10048.60 → 10052.18] Because if you go, I want this thing, and then you try to buy it, and it's like,
[10052.46 → 10057.32] you can use these things to buy it, I think it's exactly the same as showing a Klarna button.
[10057.60 → 10059.40] Because if you're like, oh, I don't have one of these,
[10059.68 → 10062.82] you can just look it up and have a credit card afterwards.
[10063.20 → 10063.54] Yeah.
[10063.86 → 10064.90] I think that's reasonable.
[10064.90 → 10068.54] It's always interesting when we get the drop PayPal suggestion.
[10070.08 → 10074.08] So many people, literally, the second we dropped PayPal from our site,
[10074.30 → 10078.96] I guarantee you our customer support inbox would just be flooded with people asking
[10078.96 → 10082.82] why the fuck we don't support PayPal because now they have no way to buy anything from our store.
[10083.58 → 10085.10] A surprising number of people.
[10085.18 → 10086.30] I didn't realize this.
[10086.36 → 10091.04] PayPal is not a huge part of my life paying for things.
[10091.04 → 10094.38] I don't really use it other than like corporately.
[10095.26 → 10101.04] But some regions that they are super reliant on PayPal, they're super into PayPal.
[10101.60 → 10102.92] And that's just the way it is.
[10103.16 → 10106.64] Not taking PayPal would not be a good idea.
[10106.92 → 10107.42] Period.
[10107.64 → 10112.04] It would just, it would literally make customers mad for...
[10112.04 → 10115.38] What would we accomplish?
[10116.04 → 10119.34] PayPal is functionally a monopoly in their space.
[10119.54 → 10122.14] That would be like me refusing to engage with Ticketmaster.
[10122.34 → 10122.60] You know what?
[10122.62 → 10125.02] I'll just never go to a concert again because fuck Ticketmaster.
[10125.20 → 10128.50] And honestly, that would be a pretty based take at this point.
[10129.08 → 10133.14] Like, if that was somebody's stance, I wouldn't be like, I disagree.
[10133.14 → 10135.70] I'd be like, that's pretty cool.
[10135.96 → 10141.58] But also, I like to go to concerts and stage plays and stuff.
[10141.78 → 10144.36] So I'm probably going to have to buy from Ticketmaster.
[10151.26 → 10155.02] Yeah, speaking of how money makes the world go around.

[10260.92 → 10262.14] Do you need to talk about it?
[10262.26 → 10262.76] Or...
[10263.38 → 10263.98] Oh, what is this?
[10264.92 → 10266.82] What is a one-time card, and how does it work?
[10268.10 → 10269.94] Use Klarna Payment Options at any Visa?
[10269.94 → 10272.70] The one-time card service enables you to use Klarna Payment Options
[10272.70 → 10275.44] at any Visa card-accepting online store in the US.
[10275.62 → 10276.04] Oh, okay.
[10276.04 → 10278.04] You can just generate credit cards with Klarna.
[10278.16 → 10280.88] So it literally just is a credit card if you use it that way?
[10281.44 → 10281.84] No.
[10282.24 → 10283.96] It means you can use it anywhere.
[10284.28 → 10285.96] It means you can use Klarna anywhere.
[10286.18 → 10286.86] Oh, I see.
[10288.02 → 10288.42] I see.
[10288.64 → 10290.68] Doesn't matter if they accept it or not.
[10291.46 → 10292.24] They both do!
[10295.42 → 10295.78] Okay.
[10296.08 → 10298.40] I don't want to talk to you guys about this anymore
[10298.40 → 10300.40] and I don't think chat wants to hear you talk about it anymore either.
[10300.56 → 10300.86] I agree.
[10300.88 → 10302.46] So why don't we talk...
[10302.46 → 10303.16] Oh, God.
[10303.16 → 10304.90] I scrolled over the OpenAI one.
[10304.90 → 10307.02] I'll minimize that.
[10307.08 → 10307.98] Let's not talk about that.
[10309.82 → 10312.82] Why don't we look at this cool...
[10312.82 → 10313.68] Anything good?
[10313.70 → 10314.74] An LTT VR.
[10314.74 → 10314.78] Yeah!
[10314.78 → 10316.04] Made a backpack commercial.
[10316.30 → 10317.10] There is something good.
[10318.32 → 10318.54] Wait.
[10318.62 → 10319.16] Go back.
[10319.44 → 10320.02] Go back to what?
[10321.60 → 10322.54] This is so cool.
[10322.64 → 10323.02] Just...
[10323.02 → 10323.60] I don't know.
[10323.60 → 10325.92] I made this about a year ago.
[10326.06 → 10328.04] Says mean ad 9378.
[10328.28 → 10329.16] It's just been sitting on my...
[10329.16 → 10330.54] The house lick was that transition.
[10330.66 → 10330.78] Sorry.
[10331.32 → 10333.10] It's just been sitting on my laptop ever since.
[10333.20 → 10334.28] Thought I'd share it with you all.
[10334.58 → 10337.76] It's no masterpiece, but thought it'd be better if it was seen by someone rather than sitting
[10337.76 → 10338.72] on my hard drive forever.
[10339.22 → 10340.02] Let me know what you think.
[10340.20 → 10341.32] If it sucks, tell me it sucks.
[10341.52 → 10344.16] It was just a project to keep me busy at the time, so no hard feelings.
[10345.10 → 10345.72] So cool!
[10346.98 → 10348.04] That's all I have to say about that.
[10348.16 → 10350.66] Just thought we'd, you know, change the tone a little bit here.
[10351.20 → 10351.80] What else we got?
[10351.88 → 10352.46] Ah, yes!
[10353.10 → 10355.80] ASUS is rolling out fixes for DOG laptops.
[10356.30 → 10360.50] Users have been complaining about stuttering issues on ASUS laptops, and DOG has released
[10360.50 → 10364.24] a beta BIOS update on September 26th to remedy these issues.
[10364.60 → 10369.08] Currently it is a beta, but there are plans for a finalized release in hopefully early October.
[10369.74 → 10373.96] And our discussion question here from Mr. Adam Sondergaard is, how does this response
[10373.96 → 10377.62] from ASUS compare to their responses to customer complaints in the past?
[10378.76 → 10379.56] Surprisingly quick!
[10380.66 → 10381.10] Yeah.
[10381.10 → 10386.34] All things considered, I mean, it was two weeks ago that, oh man, sorry, I forget the name,
[10386.50 → 10392.42] but developer buddy sort of highlighted what he thought were the problems with their
[10392.42 → 10393.56] firmware.
[10393.96 → 10395.52] So, what did I just press?
[10395.62 → 10396.92] Oh, I pressed this one, whatever, no big deal.
[10397.12 → 10398.86] I don't remember his name either.
[10399.12 → 10403.50] Yeah, I'm not too worried about it at the moment, but why don't we do, oh, this is cool.
[10403.50 → 10415.30] PC Games Hardware.de tested 180, I don't know, I don't read German, so whatever.
[10415.86 → 10420.48] Tested 180, oh, okay, well apparently that was the wrong one.
[10420.62 → 10421.16] Cool.
[10421.16 → 10426.40] Tested 180 games across four benchmarks.
[10426.40 → 10432.08] Just in case you were curious, how an RTX 4090...
[10432.08 → 10434.32] 150 cards, not games.
[10434.66 → 10436.34] Sorry, 180 GPUs.
[10436.34 → 10436.84] Did I say games?
[10436.94 → 10437.24] I'm sorry.
[10437.24 → 10438.24] Sorry.
[10438.24 → 10440.42] 180 GPUs across four benchmarks.
[10440.58 → 10448.96] In case you wanted to know how an RTX 5090 compares to, say, a Radeon HD 5750.
[10449.90 → 10451.80] This is super cool.
[10451.92 → 10453.20] You guys should go check it out.
[10453.62 → 10457.98] One of the top upvoted comments on this was, this is the sort of work that labs should be
[10457.98 → 10462.50] doing with one of the top upvoted replies to that being, no they shouldn't, this is stupid.
[10462.50 → 10464.46] I agree with the top comment.
[10465.06 → 10470.22] This is exactly the sort of thing that I would love for labs to be able to do once we've got
[10470.22 → 10473.58] our testing automation really nailed down.
[10473.74 → 10474.76] That's going to be a hot minute.
[10474.82 → 10477.20] Which we don't yet, and it's going to take some time.
[10477.46 → 10478.56] Quite a bit of time.
[10478.64 → 10483.76] But I am more than willing to keep shovelling money into the furnace.
[10484.04 → 10484.70] Klarna time.
[10484.80 → 10485.70] The money furnace.
[10486.62 → 10488.82] And that's what we use to heat our buildings in the winter.
[10488.82 → 10493.58] And I want to make this happen.
[10493.76 → 10497.86] I want to make it interactive with some of the cool features that the labs website has
[10497.86 → 10501.12] been working on, or the labs web team has been working on over the last little while.
[10502.08 → 10505.42] Oh, we had a topic called, there's so much happening at labs.
[10505.44 → 10506.24] We sure do.
[10506.38 → 10506.68] Oh, okay.
[10506.72 → 10507.94] We weren't showing any new features.
[10508.20 → 10509.54] So we'll get to that in a second.
[10509.54 → 10510.84] There's technically a feature.
[10511.28 → 10516.74] But with all the comparison stuff, with our ideas for bringing your own price, so that you
[10516.74 → 10518.30] can compare used stuff.
[10518.30 → 10518.64] That works.
[10518.74 → 10520.04] We just need more GPs on the site.
[10520.10 → 10520.60] But those are coming.
[10520.82 → 10521.36] Yeah, let's go.
[10521.46 → 10523.94] So yeah, no, I want to do it.
[10524.30 → 10532.48] But we're going to have a test farm in order to test at that kind of scale.
[10532.68 → 10533.94] And I'm here for it.
[10533.96 → 10534.36] I'm excited.
[10535.46 → 10536.16] It's going to be a while.
[10538.10 → 10538.76] But it's coming.
[10539.42 → 10539.76] Okay.
[10540.24 → 10540.88] Is it time?
[10540.98 → 10541.80] Do I talk about the articles?
[10542.06 → 10542.56] Okay, sure.
[10542.68 → 10546.48] Yeah, there's been a lot of articles on the lab site recently.
[10546.48 → 10549.72] And some people have actually noticed.
[10549.72 → 10555.10] We've gotten a bunch of views specifically on this one from Lucas, the iPhone 17 series
[10555.10 → 10558.86] test results, which is a companion article.
[10558.86 → 10560.98] And I do want to show off that feature.
[10560.98 → 10567.38] So if I'm on the say, main page, and I see these latest articles on the side, I can check
[10567.38 → 10569.24] out the different tags that they have.
[10569.48 → 10572.58] So the iPhone 17 series has short circuit companion.
[10572.58 → 10575.74] So if I click on that, well, there's one.
[10576.74 → 10578.34] The beta site has more than one.
[10579.00 → 10580.42] That's a teaser, I guess.
[10580.52 → 10581.78] But I'm used to that being more than one.
[10581.82 → 10585.46] I can go to investigative and see that we have all these articles that are tagged with
[10585.46 → 10585.92] investigative.
[10586.54 → 10589.10] And as we keep going, we're going to try to keep on having more.
[10589.72 → 10591.26] So you can kind of sort through things nicely.
[10591.26 → 10597.98] But the iPhone 17 series test results are great if you want to dive further into the iPhone
[10597.98 → 10603.10] than the video did in regard to performance and results and whatnot.
[10603.74 → 10605.26] This one was really fun.
[10605.38 → 10611.14] There was a quote from Linus where he said, this graphics processing unit has functionally
[10611.14 → 10613.30] zero support for graphics processing.
[10613.62 → 10616.46] No Vulcan, no DirectX, and no OpenGL to speak of.
[10616.46 → 10624.64] And that sparked Nick and Jesse to work on the Why Are These Called Graphics Cards article,
[10624.64 → 10628.10] which I thought was a brilliant idea for something to write.
[10628.30 → 10631.42] And it's long and very interesting.
[10631.72 → 10635.10] And I think you should check it out if that sparks your interest.
[10635.52 → 10637.60] And then there's, is there a question at the bottom here?
[10637.80 → 10639.56] Yeah, we'd love to hear your thoughts on the LCT forum.
[10639.66 → 10640.68] There's a little thread there.
[10640.78 → 10641.98] So maybe check it out.
[10642.32 → 10644.42] Thread there on the H200, to be clear.
[10644.42 → 10647.74] And then there is the newest one.
[10647.92 → 10649.92] This came out six hours ago.
[10650.66 → 10653.46] And this is the Intel Arc Pro B50.
[10653.74 → 10655.92] Your workstation deserves nice things too.
[10656.68 → 10659.34] And this dives over the B50 card.
[10659.42 → 10664.24] There are some stats in here in the table for like the B60, but we don't have a B60.
[10664.46 → 10670.86] We are interested in Intel's Battle Matrix thing because this looks sick and that would be B60s.
[10670.94 → 10673.00] But maybe another day, maybe another time.
[10673.00 → 10675.22] This article is kind of fun.
[10675.36 → 10675.94] There are memes.
[10676.16 → 10676.72] It's cool.
[10676.86 → 10677.34] Check it out.
[10677.40 → 10683.30] But yeah, we are, we have been pumping some articles on the lab site, and they are pretty neat, pretty cool.
[10683.48 → 10685.60] So consider checking those out.
[10686.12 → 10694.40] The iPhone 17 article got a lot of traffic from like suggestions and Google and external sources,
[10694.50 → 10696.62] not just people going to it, which was neat.
[10696.62 → 10707.50] Our highest click through lately that isn't just Google search has been not the YouTube channel.
[10708.78 → 10709.34] Really?
[10709.62 → 10711.14] I think I told you about this already.
[10711.30 → 10712.40] Maybe not in those terms.
[10712.56 → 10714.56] You told me the click through was good.
[10715.36 → 10717.96] Well, yeah, but it's, it's Hacker News.
[10717.96 → 10718.96] Really?
[10718.96 → 10724.54] We've had more clicks from Hacker News than the Linus Tech Tips or Short Circuit YouTube channels.
[10725.46 → 10727.90] Even both of those combined, as far as my understanding goes.
[10728.32 → 10731.06] It's been a lot more from Hacker News, which has been pretty sick.
[10731.36 → 10732.00] So that's cool.
[10732.24 → 10735.90] I don't know necessarily what Hacker News wants to know about things,
[10735.90 → 10739.20] but considering they're driving a decent amount of our traffic at this point.
[10740.14 → 10744.32] If you're a frequenter of Hacker News, maybe ask us some questions or something.
[10744.46 → 10744.84] I don't know.
[10744.92 → 10746.44] We'll keep, we'll keep working on stuff.
[10746.44 → 10752.58] At this point, the goal for labs in regard to articles is that if we think something is interesting
[10752.58 → 10758.20] or we ask a question, or if we see someone else ask an interesting question, we just want to do it.
[10758.46 → 10760.90] And if that ends up becoming a video, sweet.
[10761.08 → 10762.58] And if it doesn't, cool.
[10762.58 → 10768.20] We have an article on it because one of the big goals is to just expand the knowledge base within labs
[10768.20 → 10774.30] and make it so that reading labs articles is like a fun, interesting, you know,
[10774.40 → 10778.34] keeping up with what's happening in tech thing for you to do.
[10778.42 → 10782.94] And not keeping up with what's happening in tech in regard to just like news and announcements,
[10783.62 → 10787.86] but knowledge and learning and those fun things.
[10788.28 → 10791.40] So yeah, keep checking those out.
[10791.48 → 10792.36] We like writing those.
[10792.36 → 10793.24] We like your feedback.
[10793.54 → 10798.64] We don't have comments on the site yet, but we generally use the forum as a feedback vector.
[10798.88 → 10800.48] So do that.
[10803.14 → 10804.98] Yeah, that's basically that whole topic.
[10805.04 → 10806.28] I just wanted to shout out those articles.
[10807.08 → 10807.28] Cool.
[10809.58 → 10815.64] Man, how did we start out with, I don't think we have enough for the show today.
[10815.64 → 10817.04] It's every time.
[10817.16 → 10817.62] Oh man.
[10817.74 → 10818.42] Every time.
[10818.50 → 10819.46] This is wild.
[10820.10 → 10826.22] So Red Dot is an app that crowdsources and allows users to, wait.
[10826.22 → 10828.04] Oh yeah.
[10828.04 → 10828.08] Yeah.
[10828.08 → 10832.34] Crowdsources and allows users to report sightings of ICE officials in the U.S.
[10832.90 → 10839.70] Google made a statement to 404 Media claiming that it removed apps sharing the location of ICE officials because they are a vulnerable group.
[10840.30 → 10843.14] ICE Block was the first one to be removed from the App Store.
[10843.14 → 10850.74] Apple made the move after receiving pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice following an attack that was made on an ICE facility injuring detainees.
[10851.40 → 10859.16] Google gave a statement to Engadget that they never had ICE Block on their platform, but removed similar apps anyway for violations of their policies.
[10860.06 → 10865.42] Besides the recent attack, Google clarified that these apps didn't appropriately moderate user-generated content.
[10865.90 → 10873.98] Red Dot claimed that their app aggregates reports from multiple trusted sources alongside user-generated content to determine which locations should be marked with activity.
[10873.98 → 10883.66] However, the app developers asserted they do not track any individual person's movements, and they reject harassment interference or harm towards ICE agents or anyone else.
[10883.94 → 10888.12] It remains to be seen whether any of the removed apps will be allowed back on either platform.
[10888.12 → 10905.02] It's been very interesting to watch the discourse around this and how it has changed now that it is ICE agents rather than Chinese authorities in Hong Kong.
[10906.44 → 10908.14] I will leave it there.
[10911.70 → 10913.46] No, I won't quite leave it there.
[10913.46 → 10935.16] There was a lot of discussion around how Apple bending the knee to China by removing apps that allowed protesters to figure out where Chinese authority crackdowns were happening was anti-free speech, anti-American, all that.
[10935.90 → 10940.20] And for some reason, it's an extremely different conversation here.
[10940.20 → 10952.80] I'm not saying I don't think I'll take a position on whether these apps should that allow tracking of law enforcement in near real time should exist on either platform.
[10952.94 → 10956.46] That's not really that's not really my role right now or here.
[10956.58 → 10958.84] All I really ask for is some consistency.
[10959.20 → 10966.40] If you're going to take a principled stand on something, then you should take a principled stand equally if it's in some other country or if it's in your own.
[10967.28 → 10967.90] That's all.
[10970.20 → 10971.62] Oh, no.
[10971.78 → 10972.74] More AI stuff?
[10972.84 → 10973.44] Do we have to?
[10973.46 → 10975.10] There's a lot of AI stuff in the dock.
[10975.20 → 10975.94] Can be just not?
[10978.50 → 10979.62] Yeah, let's just not.
[10980.66 → 10981.24] Oh, God.
[10981.52 → 10984.16] Meta's going to use your AI chat history to serve you even more targeted.
[10984.28 → 10985.48] I mean, that's kind of a given.
[10986.20 → 10986.76] You know what?
[10986.90 → 10987.60] I'm just going to take it.
[10987.70 → 10988.58] I'm going to get rid of it.
[10989.02 → 10989.28] Yep.
[10989.46 → 10990.14] Okay, it's gone now.
[10990.46 → 10991.32] Now I don't have to know.
[10991.80 → 10992.08] Okay.
[10992.76 → 10996.06] Did we do the UK demands backdoor access to Apple Cloud Storage again?
[10996.24 → 10996.80] Oh, sure.
[10996.88 → 10997.30] Go for it.
[10997.30 → 11006.98] Ars Technica reports a new order from the UK Home Office has demanded a backdoor to Apple's encrypted cloud storage, but just for UK citizens this time.
[11006.98 → 11014.60] This follows a January order that sought global access to encrypted user data and caused diplomatic issues with the US.
[11014.82 → 11026.08] It was announced in August that the UK had agreed to drop the demand in regard to American citizens, but the logic appeared to be that any backdoor would weaken protections for US citizens.
[11026.08 → 11034.34] Apple repeated last week, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services, and we never will.
[11034.34 → 11042.74] Our discussion question is, on a scale of 1 to 10, how surveillance state do you consider the UK?
[11043.34 → 11053.98] I don't live there, so I don't keep up with UK news nearly as closely as I do with Canadian news and our nearest neighbour news.
[11053.98 → 11061.22] So I'm not even going to begin to wade into that one other than to say that a lot of what we've seen doesn't look great.
[11061.86 → 11062.30] Yeah.
[11062.80 → 11063.24] Yeah.
[11063.44 → 11064.52] I think that's fair to say.
[11064.52 → 11068.06] We did the testing GPUs.
[11069.06 → 11069.58] Yeah.
[11069.58 → 11070.34] Rapid fire.
[11070.90 → 11071.66] AI stuff.
[11072.46 → 11074.00] AI brain robot thing?
[11074.18 → 11087.00] I think us free Western democracies need to really take a long, hard look in the mirror and ask ourselves how different we are from some of the authoritarian states that we for so long turned up our noses at.
[11088.30 → 11088.78] There.
[11089.02 → 11090.06] I'll say that much too.
[11091.06 → 11091.48] All right.
[11092.48 → 11093.40] What do you want to talk about?
[11093.40 → 11098.68] There's only really one topic left if we want to do it, and it's another AI one.
[11098.80 → 11099.50] I'm over it.
[11099.66 → 11103.46] It's the body agnostic AI brain robot thing.
[11103.58 → 11103.86] Okay.
[11103.88 → 11104.62] It's pretty cool.
[11105.10 → 11111.32] To demo their body agnostic AI brain, company demos, is the name demos?
[11112.76 → 11113.32] Robots.
[11113.60 → 11118.50] Oh, company demos robots relearning how to walk after being dismembered by a chainsaw.
[11119.24 → 11119.78] Pretty cool.
[11120.10 → 11120.62] Wow.
[11120.96 → 11121.18] Yeah.
[11121.18 → 11122.30] They're just like people.
[11122.30 → 11134.56] Instead of training one model for one robot, skilled.ai created a universe with 100,000 robots and used the same model to train them all for a simulated millennia worth of time.
[11135.26 → 11135.74] Cool.
[11135.74 → 11140.92] Now, when the brain is popped into a new body, it can adapt to whatever that body might be.
[11140.92 → 11150.30] A major benefit they showcase in the video is that it could adapt to modifications to whatever body it inhabits, even on robots that it had not previously been trained on.
[11150.70 → 11151.66] It's pretty cool.
[11152.04 → 11153.02] That is pretty neat.
[11153.02 → 11156.00] I don't think they needed to use a chainsaw.
[11156.20 → 11156.44] Well, now...
[11156.44 → 11157.48] No, but it's so...
[11157.48 → 11159.20] Now they're vulnerable to chainsaws.
[11159.22 → 11159.24] I get it.
[11159.24 → 11160.36] It got clicks for sure.
[11160.54 → 11160.84] Yeah.
[11161.28 → 11161.48] Yeah.
[11161.56 → 11162.82] It got us to talk about it.
[11163.04 → 11163.26] Yeah.
[11163.92 → 11164.92] Good job, marketing team.
[11165.12 → 11165.34] Yeah.
[11165.40 → 11165.76] Pretty cool.
[11166.12 → 11167.90] Hopefully, for your sake, they don't kill you first.
[11169.32 → 11169.68] Okay.
[11169.68 → 11170.42] They'll be first.
[11170.58 → 11171.16] Thanks, Luke.
[11171.16 → 11175.38] One of these days, we're going to do the all positive news WAN show.
[11176.98 → 11178.68] But it is not this day.
[11179.78 → 11180.62] I'm scared.
[11181.96 → 11182.94] I'm in danger.
[11183.34 → 11185.82] You don't like that you could, like, shoot it?
[11185.90 → 11187.60] It's like a zombie at that point.
[11187.92 → 11188.88] It doesn't have to stop.
[11189.34 → 11189.64] Yeah.
[11190.46 → 11190.78] Yeah.
[11190.90 → 11192.90] I thought that they sort of...
[11192.90 → 11193.80] Yeah, I mean...
[11193.80 → 11195.42] Dude, it's like a lower accurate video game, though.
[11195.50 → 11197.58] This is where they were going.
[11197.88 → 11199.46] Shoot the red thing.
[11199.46 → 11199.78] Yeah.
[11202.02 → 11203.18] They're going to learn.
[11203.64 → 11205.84] I'm playing the new Final Fantasy Tactics remaster.
[11206.60 → 11206.90] Oh.
[11207.16 → 11207.88] I'm enjoying it.
[11208.10 → 11212.70] It's actually perfect timing for it to come out, because I have to start getting some
[11212.70 → 11214.94] time in with the Xbox LAX.
[11215.10 → 11218.18] You had issues with the Final Fantasy VI remaster.
[11218.46 → 11219.78] Well, that was just, like, the...
[11219.78 → 11220.60] Okay, so they're...
[11220.60 → 11221.80] Relatively minor ones, but you had some issues.
[11221.80 → 11222.50] Very different things.
[11222.62 → 11224.30] No, Final Fantasy is...
[11224.30 → 11225.54] It's pixel remaster.
[11225.78 → 11229.46] It's functionally the same game, but, like...
[11230.02 → 11231.00] How do I put this?
[11231.00 → 11232.96] Do you think Tactics is functionally the same game?
[11233.18 → 11233.90] Well, okay.
[11234.04 → 11241.18] So, Final Fantasy VI pixel remaster was, like, a coat of paint and a newer translation I don't
[11241.18 → 11244.86] prefer, both of which are also true of the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster.
[11244.86 → 11251.90] But with Final Fantasy VI, there were, like, game balance issues.
[11252.10 → 11256.86] Like, it felt like the tick rate wasn't right or something on certain abilities.
[11257.36 → 11260.32] And, like, I don't know.
[11260.34 → 11262.02] There were things that didn't seem quite right.
[11262.04 → 11262.94] Overall, it was perfect.
[11263.32 → 11267.82] But if I was to play through it again, again, again, I would probably just play the SNES cart.
[11267.82 → 11270.76] But as for Tactics, so far, it's looking pretty good.
[11270.82 → 11272.92] I'm playing the new remastered one.
[11273.62 → 11274.46] Are you looking this up?
[11274.50 → 11275.96] I'm playing the new remastered one.
[11276.02 → 11277.94] But it comes with the original as well.
[11278.44 → 11283.78] And the director for the remaster is actually the director of the original game.
[11283.78 → 11289.02] So, even some new content that was added in the Advance port of it, the Game Boy Advance port of it,
[11289.12 → 11292.20] has been removed because it was, like, not part of the original game.
[11292.30 → 11294.22] Is it the Ive lice Chronicles?
[11294.98 → 11295.42] Ive lice.
[11296.10 → 11296.54] Ive lice?
[11296.90 → 11297.34] Ive lice?
[11297.50 → 11298.30] Ive lice, I think.
[11298.88 → 11302.08] I originally played the game with no voice acting.
[11302.42 → 11304.24] So, I don't actually...
[11304.24 → 11305.42] The voice acting is really cool.
[11305.88 → 11309.82] I don't really use it because I like to skip quickly through things.
[11309.82 → 11314.40] So, what I generally do with JRPGs is, like, this is my new technique,
[11314.96 → 11317.56] is I switch the language over to Japanese, which I don't speak.
[11318.14 → 11321.90] And so, that way, I can hear the intonation for as long as it goes.
[11322.46 → 11325.32] And then I can cut it off mid-sentence, and I'll never know the difference.
[11327.52 → 11327.92] Okay.
[11328.02 → 11329.62] So, you said it comes packaged with the original.
[11330.04 → 11334.00] Is this like in the Pixel Remastered when I could press a button
[11334.00 → 11336.84] and it would switch graphic styles between?
[11336.96 → 11337.84] Or is it two launchers?
[11337.84 → 11339.58] There are two games in the launcher.
[11339.82 → 11340.42] Oh, I see.
[11340.56 → 11342.58] And it just has a lot of little creature comforts.
[11342.62 → 11344.48] I don't love some aspects of the interface.
[11344.72 → 11345.94] There's a little bit more delay.
[11346.06 → 11348.74] Like, if you want to rip through menus, you can't.
[11348.96 → 11350.10] There's a bit of delay on them.
[11350.54 → 11357.90] And, like, the menu for learning new job abilities and assigning them,
[11358.28 → 11360.34] those are in two completely different places
[11360.34 → 11362.82] for reasons that I'm not quite sure that I fully understand.
[11363.06 → 11366.52] So, hopefully, these are things that they can continue to fine-tune over time.
[11366.52 → 11370.42] But little creature comforts like being able to press the right button
[11370.42 → 11374.98] to quickly navigate through cut scenes is, like, a lifesaver
[11374.98 → 11376.82] because some of them are really long in this game
[11376.82 → 11379.44] and I don't think the original had any way to fast-forward or skip them.
[11380.64 → 11384.06] There's, I would say, better camera controls.
[11385.18 → 11386.92] Graphics look a little nicer.
[11387.36 → 11387.52] Yeah.
[11387.52 → 11392.18] An oddly big, maybe not that odd, an oddly big thing for me with remasters
[11392.18 → 11394.50] is are the controls more modern?
[11395.00 → 11395.38] Definitely.
[11395.88 → 11398.60] Because some of the old controls for things are brutal.
[11398.68 → 11399.94] Well, Tactics was for PS1.
[11400.08 → 11401.56] I mean, analog sticks were not a given.
[11401.98 → 11402.26] Yeah.
[11402.46 → 11402.66] Right?
[11402.80 → 11408.22] So, being able to use a stick for the camera control compared to,
[11408.22 → 11414.40] I believe it was left and right R1, R2 to rotate the camera on the PS1 version.
[11414.72 → 11415.68] Yeah, it's an improvement.
[11415.98 → 11418.62] There's no official announcement as far as my understanding goes,
[11418.72 → 11422.12] but there's, like, very extensive reputable leaks
[11422.12 → 11425.14] that there's going to be an Assassin's Creed Black Flag remaster.
[11425.94 → 11426.60] You'd play it.
[11426.72 → 11427.08] Mm-hmm.
[11427.44 → 11428.98] You'd play the heck out of that.
[11428.98 → 11429.32] Mm-hmm.
[11431.56 → 11433.52] I don't think you'd 100% it.
[11433.96 → 11434.20] No.
[11434.38 → 11435.82] I never 100%ed the first one.
[11436.48 → 11438.04] There was one Assassin's Creed you did.
[11438.04 → 11438.94] Hold on, hold on, don't tell me.
[11440.82 → 11441.18] Two.
[11441.46 → 11443.16] There was three that I did.
[11443.32 → 11443.76] Oh, all right.
[11443.94 → 11445.64] Did you 100% Assassin's Creed II?
[11445.82 → 11446.04] Yep.
[11446.12 → 11447.42] Okay, then I got it at least one third right.
[11447.42 → 11449.90] And you're still kind of actually entirely right,
[11449.98 → 11453.26] because it was two, two Brotherhood, and two Ascension.
[11453.54 → 11453.90] Nice.
[11455.84 → 11456.24] Nice.
[11457.24 → 11460.30] I got my Luke lore, like, mostly down.
[11462.56 → 11464.08] That's pretty deep lore, too.
[11464.14 → 11466.00] I don't think we've talked about Assassin's Creed II
[11466.00 → 11468.06] since we were sitting on the couch at the Langley house.
[11468.18 → 11469.86] That honestly sounds accurate.
[11472.72 → 11474.24] I think it's time for After Dark.
[11474.32 → 11474.94] Should we do this thing?
[11476.58 → 11479.64] Remember when After Dark was, like, a cheeky name
[11479.64 → 11481.70] for when the WAN show ran really late
[11481.70 → 11483.00] and it had gotten dark outside?
[11483.46 → 11484.36] Now it's a given,
[11484.56 → 11486.84] and it's always dark outside at the end of the WAN show?
[11486.90 → 11487.72] How did this happen?
[11487.82 → 11488.82] What did you do, Dan?
[11488.82 → 11490.94] I don't know.
[11491.16 → 11491.84] I don't know.
[11492.02 → 11496.66] I'm solely responsible for your scheduling
[11496.66 → 11499.22] day in and day out,
[11499.38 → 11505.18] as well as our keeping you on topic.
[11505.38 → 11506.00] Yeah, way to be.
[11507.02 → 11508.20] All right, After Dark,
[11508.38 → 11509.40] hit me with a merch message.
[11509.60 → 11510.58] I'm going to push another button.
[11510.76 → 11512.98] In Dan's defence, question mark?
[11513.72 → 11515.68] We didn't get to start the show today
[11515.68 → 11516.76] until rather late.
[11516.98 → 11519.26] Okay, I was doing something very important.
[11519.78 → 11521.54] I'm going to be travelling next week,
[11521.86 → 11523.88] and I...
[11523.88 → 11524.66] Are you away for WAN?
[11525.52 → 11525.70] No.
[11525.96 → 11526.44] Okay, cool.
[11526.58 → 11527.62] Yeah, I'm just going down Vid Summit.
[11528.02 → 11529.12] So I was away next...
[11529.12 → 11530.38] I'm going to be away next week,
[11530.78 → 11532.54] and so I wasn't going to have a chance
[11532.54 → 11535.54] to shoot a video that was like...
[11535.54 → 11536.80] It was a quick one for me to write.
[11536.84 → 11537.96] It took me, like, a couple of hours,
[11538.28 → 11540.50] but I still needed a couple of hours to write it,
[11540.50 → 11543.60] and it's something that we need to address,
[11543.66 → 11545.00] I feel, quite urgently,
[11545.00 → 11547.90] and I didn't want to wait another week
[11547.90 → 11550.76] to be able to film it once I'm back.
[11551.68 → 11553.98] It's addressing the issue around YouTube
[11553.98 → 11557.08] members-only videos on our channel,
[11557.62 → 11561.36] and I think they got to go,
[11562.20 → 11566.26] and so rather than us just oinking them
[11566.26 → 11567.66] with no communication,
[11567.66 → 11570.60] I wanted us to have a very clear statement,
[11570.60 → 11571.78] so I wrote something up,
[11571.78 → 11573.78] and then I did, like, a quick...
[11573.78 → 11576.02] like, peer review for the script
[11576.02 → 11577.04] with James,
[11577.12 → 11578.56] and then Jordan also had a look at it,
[11578.62 → 11580.36] and then I quickly shot it before WAN,
[11580.40 → 11582.00] but it did take me a little bit of time.
[11582.22 → 11584.78] Do you have a way to export the...
[11586.18 → 11587.94] Is this even okay?
[11588.82 → 11590.06] I'll figure out if it's okay after.
[11590.44 → 11591.88] Do you have a way to export
[11591.88 → 11593.88] the email list of all your members?
[11594.16 → 11594.38] No.
[11595.28 → 11595.62] All right.
[11595.62 → 11596.46] Heavens no.
[11596.56 → 11597.00] I mean, YouTube,
[11597.82 → 11598.88] that's the whole point of them
[11598.88 → 11600.52] controlling every aspect of the platform.
[11600.66 → 11600.88] I was going to say,
[11600.94 → 11601.90] we could offer them, like,
[11601.92 → 11603.40] a free month on Float plate or something
[11603.40 → 11604.90] just to get them started.
[11605.12 → 11606.56] I don't think we'd really have a way of doing that.
[11606.66 → 11608.86] Do we have the ability to offer a free month,
[11608.92 → 11610.12] or would that be, like, manual?
[11611.08 → 11612.76] We can do that if we have, like,
[11612.78 → 11615.38] a, you know, Excel sheet.
[11615.64 → 11616.32] Oh, I see.
[11616.44 → 11616.70] Okay.
[11617.46 → 11617.76] All right.
[11617.82 → 11619.74] But we'd want all their...
[11619.74 → 11621.20] We'd need all their emails.
[11621.42 → 11621.62] Yeah.
[11621.62 → 11622.38] I thought we, like,
[11622.46 → 11624.34] had free trials as a mechanism now,
[11624.34 → 11625.34] but no, okay, yeah.
[11626.26 → 11626.66] Okay.
[11629.98 → 11630.72] Merge messages?
[11631.92 → 11632.28] Yeah.
[11632.48 → 11632.70] Hit me.
[11633.50 → 11633.90] Linus,
[11634.14 → 11635.50] is Yvonne into the braces?
[11636.04 → 11636.30] Also,
[11636.50 → 11638.44] any tips for someone switching to Graphene OS?
[11639.54 → 11640.18] Heavens no.
[11641.96 → 11642.64] She, like,
[11642.74 → 11644.28] didn't want to kiss me for a while
[11644.28 → 11645.56] because she was afraid I'd, like,
[11645.64 → 11645.88] you know,
[11645.92 → 11646.90] rip her lip off.
[11646.90 → 11649.26] Yeah.
[11649.56 → 11650.90] Any excuse, I guess.
[11651.52 → 11651.96] Ouch.
[11652.56 → 11653.00] Damn.
[11653.00 → 11659.42] Oh, no.
[11663.36 → 11664.80] Who are you kissing, Dan?
[11666.46 → 11669.22] I guess the unemployment line after that.
[11669.22 → 11673.92] I should say,
[11674.00 → 11675.24] same amount of people as you.
[11675.34 → 11675.72] There you go.
[11678.04 → 11678.82] Give me a second.
[11678.92 → 11679.40] Give me a second.
[11682.34 → 11683.00] It's late.
[11683.14 → 11683.60] I'm slow.
[11683.92 → 11684.52] Girasol says,
[11684.60 → 11684.94] Linus,
[11685.02 → 11685.56] too mean.
[11687.80 → 11688.16] Hey,
[11688.20 → 11688.92] I started it.
[11690.14 → 11690.92] Oh, man.
[11691.16 → 11692.42] Hot Pawn Cracker says,
[11692.46 → 11693.78] Yvonne likes to pick the food out.
[11693.86 → 11693.98] No,
[11694.08 → 11695.36] she definitely doesn't.
[11696.02 → 11696.80] Definitely not.
[11696.98 → 11697.40] Does that happen?
[11697.48 → 11697.96] Is that a problem?
[11697.96 → 11698.32] I can't.
[11698.38 → 11698.56] No,
[11698.72 → 11698.90] no,
[11698.94 → 11699.26] I would,
[11699.36 → 11704.04] I would definitely not go anywhere near her mouth with these unless they were clean.
[11704.76 → 11705.20] I,
[11705.20 → 11706.32] I believe in,
[11706.44 → 11707.80] I believe in personal hygiene.
[11708.10 → 11708.84] Did you mean like,
[11708.88 → 11709.88] does food get lodged?
[11710.48 → 11710.84] Yeah.
[11710.84 → 11711.12] Like,
[11711.18 → 11712.82] are they difficult to like keep clean?
[11712.98 → 11714.72] I could probably get like a one inch,
[11714.78 → 11716.82] like section of noodle stuck in them.
[11716.86 → 11717.40] Like it's,
[11717.56 → 11718.26] it's horrible.
[11718.58 → 11718.98] Yeah.
[11719.06 → 11720.16] Because I was going to say when I had braces,
[11720.20 → 11721.32] I was absolutely a thing.
[11722.72 → 11723.12] Um,
[11723.80 → 11725.58] Oh,
[11725.64 → 11726.70] as for graphene OS,
[11726.70 → 11727.40] I'd say,
[11727.40 → 11729.42] I'd say graphene OS.
[11729.68 → 11730.16] So we have,
[11730.32 → 11731.80] I actually shot that video today to,
[11731.94 → 11732.34] uh,
[11732.38 → 11732.56] the
[11732.62 → 11733.32] the switch dude,
[11733.36 → 11734.86] it has like the funniest intro.
[11734.96 → 11738.44] I think we've shot in probably at least a month,
[11738.48 → 11739.70] maybe like six months.
[11739.82 → 11741.14] It's so funny.
[11741.80 → 11742.24] Um,
[11742.36 → 11742.86] it starts,
[11742.96 → 11743.12] I'm,
[11743.16 → 11749.94] I'm just like talking about graphene OS and I like notice someone coming after me.
[11749.94 → 11751.56] And then I go, and I like try,
[11751.72 → 11753.56] I'm about to like to try to steal a motorcycle.
[11753.56 → 11759.20] And then like I get arrested, and then I'm like taking my mugshot because the
[11759.20 → 11760.56] the title of the video is going to be,
[11760.64 → 11761.98] I tried the criminals choice,
[11762.18 → 11762.70] the criminals,
[11762.70 → 11763.06] uh,
[11763.06 → 11764.42] phone of choice for a month.
[11765.10 → 11765.50] Um,
[11765.50 → 11768.40] but everything that I'm saying is just totally straight-faced,
[11768.40 → 11769.88] like about graphene OS.
[11769.88 → 11770.16] And,
[11770.32 → 11772.56] and we almost immediately address that.
[11772.62 → 11776.26] There are lots of reasons to be into graphene OS outside,
[11776.38 → 11776.82] if you're,
[11776.82 → 11777.80] you know,
[11777.86 → 11778.56] a ne'er do well.
[11778.86 → 11779.30] Um,
[11779.30 → 11779.72] but yeah,
[11779.72 → 11780.64] uh,
[11780.64 → 11783.76] it ends up Jordan wrote this hilarious thing.
[11783.76 → 11784.24] It's like,
[11784.24 → 11784.86] you know,
[11785.30 → 11785.94] um,
[11786.50 → 11789.58] whether you're just really into privacy or you're an her do well,
[11789.58 → 11792.48] or you stub your toe running from the police or something like that.
[11792.48 → 11795.64] So I like stub my toe and like wipe out.
[11795.90 → 11796.80] And I'm like,
[11796.80 → 11799.84] like Peter Griffin graphene OS.
[11800.02 → 11800.46] Like,
[11800.54 → 11801.62] I don't know.
[11801.66 → 11801.88] We,
[11801.96 → 11802.10] uh,
[11802.10 → 11804.00] we put Jordan in one of those hilarious,
[11804.00 → 11805.70] like British style cop.
[11805.70 → 11805.94] Oh,
[11805.96 → 11806.80] it was so cute.
[11806.92 → 11807.46] And it is like,
[11807.70 → 11809.08] it was adorable.
[11809.08 → 11812.18] It's like 40% the size it needs to be for his head.
[11812.30 → 11812.88] So tiny.
[11814.34 → 11817.22] And then we have them like pushing me down into the cop car.
[11817.32 → 11818.28] I like hit my head.
[11818.40 → 11818.44] Um,
[11818.84 → 11819.06] you know,
[11819.06 → 11819.28] like,
[11819.32 → 11819.44] yeah,
[11819.44 → 11819.76] I don't know.
[11819.76 → 11819.90] It's,
[11820.00 → 11820.66] it's hilarious.
[11821.28 → 11821.72] Um,
[11821.76 → 11822.38] should be good.
[11822.48 → 11822.78] Anyway,
[11822.78 → 11826.96] my tip would be done it at a time when you're going to be off.
[11827.00 → 11827.16] If,
[11827.22 → 11828.52] if you're not super technical,
[11828.52 → 11829.04] like super,
[11829.12 → 11829.76] super technical,
[11829.76 → 11831.22] you don't ADB all the things.
[11831.74 → 11832.10] Um,
[11832.10 → 11839.06] I would say do it at a time when you're going to be off for like a couple of days on a long weekend or something so that you have a bit of
[11839.06 → 11840.28] time for your side quests,
[11840.28 → 11842.12] because there's going to be some side quests.
[11842.24 → 11848.38] You're not going to just immediately start smoothly daily driving it and everything works exactly the way that you expect it to.
[11848.78 → 11849.06] Uh,
[11849.06 → 11852.32] that doesn't mean that it's bad in any way.
[11852.84 → 11853.66] Super cool.
[11853.66 → 11855.30] And for a lot of people,
[11855.40 → 11856.34] not for everyone,
[11856.48 → 11859.22] but just give yourself a bit of extra time to get it set up.
[11859.70 → 11860.24] That's what I would say.
[11862.20 → 11862.36] Hello,
[11862.76 → 11863.16] Linus,
[11863.24 → 11864.90] the tech and the tips.
[11865.20 → 11866.06] Winch face.
[11866.74 → 11869.78] I was recently watching an older LDD video,
[11869.94 → 11873.52] and I was reminded that Linus hates monitor light bars.
[11874.04 → 11878.20] What are some other objectively wrong opinions you hold?
[11878.20 → 11884.32] You're asking me to determine which things I believe are wrong.
[11885.78 → 11886.74] That's tough.
[11887.20 → 11887.72] Luke,
[11887.78 → 11892.10] maybe you could tell me something that I am objectively wrong about.
[11892.16 → 11895.04] I don't think you're objectively wrong about monitor bars,
[11895.18 → 11896.74] so that's going to be tough.
[11896.74 → 11897.16] Um,
[11897.16 → 11908.94] we agree on a lot of stuff.
[11909.54 → 11909.98] Yeah,
[11910.12 → 11911.56] I'm sure there's something there.
[11911.74 → 11911.80] I,
[11911.98 → 11913.40] that's actually a really fun one.
[11913.40 → 11919.38] How often I see people talk about what an idiot I am and how someone sensible like Luke could hang around with me for so long.
[11919.94 → 11924.56] I think that means that Luke is also not sensible then by proxy.
[11925.06 → 11925.50] Oh,
[11925.52 → 11925.62] no,
[11925.68 → 11925.82] wait,
[11925.88 → 11926.76] hold on the internet.
[11926.76 → 11927.00] Nope.
[11927.16 → 11929.12] Always says that Luke is right about everything.
[11929.22 → 11929.42] Yeah,
[11929.52 → 11929.74] it's,
[11929.74 → 11929.96] it's,
[11929.96 → 11932.30] it's fascinating to watch how often,
[11932.70 → 11933.12] um,
[11933.28 → 11937.82] Luke is right when actually we're pretty aligned on like a lot of stuff.
[11937.92 → 11942.78] The most annoying thing for me is when like we will battle about something and people are like,
[11942.78 → 11943.44] oh yeah,
[11943.64 → 11944.30] he's doing it.
[11945.06 → 11946.54] And then a month later,
[11946.54 → 11948.74] I agree with you on something, and they're like,
[11948.82 → 11949.20] what a
[11949.44 → 11951.28] he won't,
[11951.28 → 11953.08] he won't stand up for himself.
[11953.26 → 11955.66] It's definitely Linus obviously holds so much.
[11955.66 → 11959.02] financial sway over him that he can't disagree.
[11959.02 → 11960.10] Maybe I thought it was fine.
[11960.28 → 11960.70] I don't know.
[11960.88 → 11961.40] I don't know.
[11961.44 → 11961.90] Maybe they're,
[11962.02 → 11965.44] maybe they're professional body language analysts.
[11966.90 → 11967.38] Like,
[11967.46 → 11967.92] I don't know,
[11968.00 → 11968.14] man.
[11968.14 → 11972.06] And they can use little snippets from Wan show to determine your inner,
[11972.06 → 11973.18] innermost thoughts.
[11973.30 → 11974.88] What are you objectively wrong about?
[11976.60 → 11977.84] Objectively wrong about?
[11977.84 → 11981.38] I mean,
[11981.56 → 11983.48] I'm sure I'm wrong about lots of stuff.
[11983.56 → 11984.80] I just can't think of stuff right now.
[11984.82 → 11984.84] It's just so,
[11984.84 → 11989.38] it's so hard to think of something that you believe is right.
[11990.00 → 11991.66] That is objectively wrong.
[11991.66 → 11994.20] Because obviously if I thought it was objectively wrong,
[11994.32 → 11995.18] I would.
[11995.94 → 11998.32] What is a controversial take that you have?
[11998.90 → 11999.32] I don't know.
[11999.34 → 12000.98] We could go with like ad block piracy.
[12001.12 → 12001.86] But then I agree with that.
[12001.86 → 12006.40] I also agree with the core reference of it,
[12006.46 → 12007.16] which is like,
[12007.22 → 12009.24] you can just be okay with that and that's fine.
[12009.68 → 12010.02] Yeah.
[12011.82 → 12012.26] Um,
[12012.40 → 12015.98] I think this is just hamburgers versus hot.
[12015.98 → 12017.06] There's also been a really,
[12017.20 → 12017.68] there's,
[12017.76 → 12018.00] I mean,
[12018.04 → 12020.66] there's been a fascinating new development in that whole,
[12020.78 → 12021.78] that whole take,
[12021.92 → 12022.22] uh,
[12022.22 → 12023.08] when we had the
[12023.08 → 12023.32] the
[12023.32 → 12025.32] the viewpocalypse a few weeks back.
[12025.32 → 12025.68] Yeah.
[12025.76 → 12027.60] Where disproportionately.
[12027.60 → 12028.82] I don't think that's a development.
[12028.94 → 12030.00] Tech channels with,
[12030.56 → 12030.74] no,
[12030.74 → 12032.48] but it's a way that we can objectively say,
[12032.54 → 12032.72] okay,
[12032.78 → 12032.94] yeah,
[12032.94 → 12034.32] there is a clear impact here.
[12034.50 → 12034.58] Yeah.
[12034.70 → 12040.24] Tech channels with tech-savvy audiences were disproportionately impacted by view count.
[12041.96 → 12045.24] Changes that allegedly were caused by,
[12045.24 → 12046.00] um,
[12046.12 → 12047.84] something to do with ad blocking.
[12048.10 → 12049.46] I thought it was interesting because like,
[12049.52 → 12050.42] this is obvious,
[12050.42 → 12054.38] but I just like never really thought about it.
[12054.42 → 12057.02] It's always been talked about how CPMs and tech are really low.
[12057.60 → 12058.04] Yeah.
[12059.46 → 12060.52] During that period.
[12060.52 → 12060.96] Considering,
[12060.96 → 12064.52] considering how affluent and the ages,
[12064.72 → 12066.36] the demographics of the audience.
[12066.98 → 12067.18] Yeah.
[12067.34 → 12069.50] And how they're often kind of based around shopping.
[12069.64 → 12069.80] Yeah.
[12069.80 → 12071.26] Reviews of products you might buy.
[12071.34 → 12071.48] Yeah.
[12071.68 → 12073.18] But CPMs and tech are really low.
[12073.26 → 12074.76] And then suddenly that happens.
[12074.76 → 12079.22] And CPMs and tech are not low anymore because revenue stayed the same,
[12079.22 → 12080.68] but the views went down.
[12080.68 → 12081.98] So your CPM.
[12082.42 → 12085.94] Reflective of only the viewers that had no ad blocking.
[12086.40 → 12086.52] Yeah.
[12086.52 → 12087.80] CPMs went way,
[12087.80 → 12088.52] way up.
[12088.70 → 12088.80] Yeah.
[12088.92 → 12089.52] So if,
[12089.68 → 12091.36] if nobody was running ad block,
[12091.48 → 12093.02] tech CPMs would be perfect.
[12093.48 → 12093.92] Um,
[12094.24 → 12094.42] well,
[12094.50 → 12096.08] I don't know if I want to say perfect.
[12096.14 → 12097.86] There are some sectors on YouTube that are crazy,
[12097.86 → 12099.38] like finance and whatever else,
[12099.44 → 12101.82] but they'd be much healthier.
[12101.82 → 12102.64] I'd say that,
[12102.64 → 12103.68] um,
[12106.60 → 12107.36] up next.
[12107.70 → 12107.98] Yeah.
[12108.02 → 12108.46] I don't know.
[12108.72 → 12110.22] Chat's not giving me much work with.
[12110.22 → 12111.52] I thought chat was going to,
[12111.52 → 12113.26] I thought you guys were going to hit me with this,
[12113.26 → 12114.94] like bring it on,
[12114.94 → 12118.94] but we're not making a Linus town is not objectively wrong.
[12119.02 → 12119.84] That is not inevitable.
[12119.84 → 12124.04] And I am not wrong for not making a new Christmas album.
[12124.10 → 12125.20] It was awful.
[12125.44 → 12127.48] It was so awful.
[12127.48 → 12128.48] Uh,
[12129.08 → 12129.82] it was just,
[12129.92 → 12130.56] Oh God,
[12130.60 → 12131.26] it was awful.
[12131.62 → 12132.34] I think we should,
[12132.50 → 12134.22] I think we should make a new Christmas album.
[12135.40 → 12137.38] You can't say I'm objectively wrong.
[12138.26 → 12138.48] Yeah.
[12138.56 → 12139.86] I don't think that's objective.
[12140.22 → 12141.50] And sell it on the forum again.
[12141.96 → 12142.40] Okay.
[12142.48 → 12143.92] That's objectively wrong.
[12143.92 → 12144.22] Yeah.
[12144.60 → 12145.04] Objectively.
[12145.10 → 12147.68] I think it wraps around to be better.
[12147.68 → 12150.28] Uh,
[12150.28 → 12151.14] we should just move on.
[12151.22 → 12151.54] I don't know.
[12151.62 → 12152.04] We should move on.
[12152.12 → 12152.34] I there,
[12152.42 → 12152.56] there,
[12152.56 → 12152.74] I,
[12152.82 → 12153.16] there are,
[12153.24 → 12155.26] I guarantee you there are things I think this of.
[12155.32 → 12156.44] I've just can't think of it right now.
[12156.98 → 12159.26] Should post them on wet labs' website.
[12161.02 → 12162.62] Have a look at the wrong blog.
[12164.56 → 12166.90] As experienced YouTube creators,
[12167.18 → 12170.74] often many channels have the same sponsor in which I am interested.
[12171.74 → 12172.14] Though,
[12172.40 → 12174.40] whose link should I buy?
[12174.90 → 12175.08] Uh,
[12175.08 → 12176.50] through whose link should I buy?
[12176.50 → 12178.58] What supports creators more?
[12178.74 → 12180.42] Which channels get paid more?
[12180.84 → 12182.56] What supports creators more?
[12183.06 → 12183.34] So,
[12183.64 → 12184.00] okay.
[12184.42 → 12184.86] Um,
[12184.94 → 12185.46] affiliate links,
[12185.52 → 12185.58] right?
[12185.66 → 12186.80] Basically you choose.
[12187.56 → 12188.22] Oh man,
[12188.30 → 12188.42] I,
[12188.50 → 12189.28] it's a personal choice.
[12189.36 → 12189.46] I,
[12189.56 → 12191.34] although I think there are different ways you could go about it.
[12191.40 → 12191.64] So you,
[12191.78 → 12193.96] basically the question is you watch a bunch of different creators.
[12194.16 → 12199.40] They all have referral links for the same product or service that you're planning to buy.
[12199.66 → 12200.50] So you're going to buy a laptop.
[12200.68 → 12201.48] I'd say you could,
[12201.56 → 12202.80] you could do it a number of different ways.
[12202.96 → 12205.50] You could do it based on just who you like the best.
[12205.50 → 12209.38] You could do it based on who you've gotten the most value out of over the years.
[12209.70 → 12211.08] But I personally,
[12211.26 → 12212.60] I lean away from those two.
[12212.72 → 12216.06] I lean more towards who had the best pitch,
[12216.18 → 12222.40] who had the most interesting pitch that you felt conveyed the value of the product really well,
[12222.40 → 12225.62] but didn't mislead or overhype it.
[12226.22 → 12226.80] And I,
[12226.80 → 12227.00] I,
[12227.06 → 12227.82] I think I would,
[12227.88 → 12229.10] I think I would take a
[12229.22 → 12231.68] what have you done for me lately sort of approach and go with,
[12231.74 → 12231.84] yeah,
[12231.84 → 12232.02] who,
[12232.08 → 12232.88] who had the best pitch?
[12233.02 → 12233.38] Who,
[12233.50 → 12235.38] who put a bit of extra work into,
[12235.38 → 12237.30] into doing the read?
[12237.80 → 12238.12] I,
[12238.16 → 12240.12] I think that would be a pretty okay way to do it.
[12240.12 → 12241.46] but also the other two are,
[12241.52 → 12242.72] are perfectly reasonable.
[12244.92 → 12245.32] Yeah,
[12245.54 → 12245.96] I don't know.
[12246.32 → 12247.22] I think it's a pretty good answer.
[12247.42 → 12249.16] I don't really understand the
[12249.16 → 12250.16] uh,
[12251.50 → 12256.48] like what makes more money or what creator makes more money thing.
[12257.00 → 12257.44] Oh,
[12257.68 → 12258.32] I see.
[12258.40 → 12259.74] That wasn't an additional question.
[12259.84 → 12261.52] That was a factor of the first.
[12261.60 → 12261.78] Okay.
[12261.92 → 12262.38] I get it.
[12262.44 → 12262.74] Okay.
[12262.82 → 12263.16] Great.
[12263.20 → 12264.22] Nate finally got one.
[12264.22 → 12273.16] obviously my name being Linus is objectively wrong because it's because Linus Torvalds pronounces it away.
[12273.16 → 12275.12] My first name is English.
[12275.24 → 12276.18] My last name is French.
[12276.52 → 12278.24] So your name is objectively wrong.
[12278.38 → 12278.56] Yeah.
[12279.12 → 12279.38] Yeah.
[12279.44 → 12281.52] Two objectively wrongs make a right.
[12283.40 → 12283.88] No,
[12283.92 → 12287.40] but three lefts do two L's do make a W.
[12288.04 → 12288.60] Oh,
[12289.10 → 12290.04] yeah,
[12290.10 → 12291.08] that's pretty good.
[12291.30 → 12292.72] And your name has to,
[12292.72 → 12297.10] I could do shape recognition.
[12298.02 → 12301.12] Where does the two L's make a W thing come from?
[12301.34 → 12302.58] Because I know I've done it,
[12302.66 → 12303.16] but did that,
[12303.26 → 12304.16] does that have an origin?
[12304.70 → 12305.10] Probably.
[12305.40 → 12305.64] Do I get any,
[12305.72 → 12306.74] do I get credit for that?
[12306.84 → 12307.44] I'm not sure.
[12307.62 → 12308.14] I don't.
[12308.28 → 12308.84] Is that a thing?
[12308.96 → 12309.32] I don't know.
[12309.36 → 12310.20] I'm sure it was a thing.
[12310.22 → 12311.10] It's got to be a thing,
[12311.16 → 12311.34] right?
[12311.40 → 12311.60] Yeah.
[12313.00 → 12315.52] You're objectively wrong for thinking that you get credit for that.
[12316.10 → 12316.46] Maybe.
[12319.40 → 12319.76] Hey,
[12319.76 → 12320.74] I saw you.
[12321.06 → 12321.68] I saw you.
[12321.72 → 12322.02] I saw that.
[12322.02 → 12322.72] I wasn't looking.
[12322.94 → 12324.46] I saw the flash on the stream.
[12324.98 → 12326.38] It was on there for a while.
[12326.38 → 12327.14] I saw what you did.
[12327.26 → 12328.14] I saw you do it again.
[12328.22 → 12329.18] Because it's a push button.
[12329.32 → 12329.54] Yeah,
[12329.58 → 12329.98] I know.
[12330.88 → 12331.82] I can just hold it.
[12331.92 → 12333.28] And then when you release it appears.
[12333.70 → 12333.96] Hey,
[12334.14 → 12337.08] DO watching from Japan question for.
[12337.72 → 12337.82] Oh,
[12339.66 → 12340.58] Scrapper to war season four.
[12341.04 → 12341.60] What about it?
[12342.24 → 12342.94] From Japan.
[12343.84 → 12344.74] Yours was worse.
[12345.04 → 12345.86] Painting a silver case.
[12345.86 → 12346.56] Silver is lame.
[12347.32 → 12348.30] You're objectively wrong.
[12348.30 → 12350.36] You painted a silver case.
[12350.42 → 12350.76] Silver.
[12351.76 → 12353.10] Mine was on fire,
[12353.26 → 12353.48] dude.
[12353.80 → 12354.06] Okay.
[12354.16 → 12355.38] Mine was on full fire.
[12355.58 → 12356.56] Literally or figuratively.
[12356.74 → 12357.40] It's crappy hard words.
[12357.50 → 12357.84] I don't know.
[12358.10 → 12358.40] Literally.
[12358.68 → 12358.88] Oh,
[12358.94 → 12359.52] that's way better.
[12360.34 → 12360.50] I.
[12360.50 → 12361.56] Three sources of fire.
[12361.68 → 12362.44] I painted.
[12363.64 → 12364.72] I should think Bob painted,
[12364.72 → 12367.52] but someone on my team painted that case.
[12368.26 → 12368.62] Silver.
[12369.10 → 12370.30] Because it was in very.
[12370.30 → 12371.16] What colour did it start as?
[12371.92 → 12373.26] A different silver.
[12373.48 → 12375.66] That was an extremely poor condition.
[12375.98 → 12376.30] It's very creative.
[12377.12 → 12378.18] Extremely poor condition.
[12378.18 → 12379.16] Very creative of you.
[12379.72 → 12381.16] There were budgetary constraints,
[12381.34 → 12382.28] which you will know.
[12382.46 → 12382.62] Yeah,
[12382.64 → 12383.54] that's part of scrapper wars.
[12383.64 → 12383.92] It's weird.
[12383.94 → 12385.14] So you purchased silver paint?
[12386.12 → 12386.88] I believe so.
[12387.00 → 12387.34] Actually,
[12387.50 → 12388.54] maybe it was all we had.
[12388.72 → 12388.94] I,
[12389.18 → 12389.42] you know,
[12389.52 → 12391.48] that was a very long time ago.
[12391.60 → 12392.40] I'm amazed yours.
[12392.40 → 12395.62] Maybe it's because you haven't won lately that you're so hung up on.
[12395.72 → 12397.08] Back then I was way ahead.
[12397.08 → 12397.52] Is that,
[12397.60 → 12398.36] is that the issue?
[12398.36 → 12398.76] Oh,
[12398.76 → 12398.78] I like this.
[12399.10 → 12399.70] It makes me feel good.
[12399.70 → 12402.82] Is it just because you don't have any recent victories to rub in my face?
[12402.96 → 12403.10] I,
[12403.20 → 12403.50] uh.
[12403.78 → 12403.98] No,
[12404.02 → 12405.76] it's just because your build sucked.
[12406.00 → 12406.46] And it's like,
[12406.52 → 12408.62] it sucks that judging can,
[12408.78 → 12412.30] can be so biased when you pay them.
[12413.12 → 12413.90] You know,
[12413.90 → 12420.90] for a fact that internally and in the audience,
[12420.90 → 12425.82] nobody roots for me just because I run the company.
[12426.44 → 12426.68] I,
[12426.74 → 12427.80] I think it must have.
[12427.80 → 12428.38] You know this.
[12428.68 → 12430.92] I think it must have that season because there is no way.
[12431.06 → 12432.52] I will never let this die.
[12432.76 → 12433.34] That was,
[12434.00 → 12436.60] there has been ones that I was kind of surprised by.
[12436.70 → 12438.30] Didn't necessarily agree with whatever.
[12439.68 → 12441.10] Maybe some cheating involved.
[12441.26 → 12441.66] This one.
[12441.66 → 12441.96] No.
[12442.32 → 12442.60] Just.
[12442.72 → 12443.08] Bull spit.
[12443.24 → 12444.16] Just trash.
[12444.48 → 12444.78] Bull spit.
[12444.78 → 12445.70] This one was trash.
[12445.86 → 12446.42] Bull spit.
[12446.72 → 12447.32] Did I win?
[12447.52 → 12448.26] Did I win that one?
[12448.40 → 12449.40] You won season four.
[12449.54 → 12450.30] I don't even remember.
[12450.30 → 12450.66] I've won.
[12450.66 → 12451.18] It makes no sense.
[12451.18 → 12452.12] I've won so many,
[12452.22 → 12453.76] especially recently that I can hardly.
[12453.76 → 12454.88] It makes no sense at all.
[12454.88 → 12455.94] I can hardly recall anymore.
[12456.26 → 12457.66] The L's fade into the ether.
[12457.66 → 12459.42] I think you're only actually like tied with me now.
[12459.52 → 12461.28] And you're talking so much smack.
[12461.58 → 12464.74] I'm only doing it because I know it bothers you so much.
[12464.98 → 12466.50] It's so trash.
[12466.58 → 12470.26] He's actually so upset that he's lost both modern era.
[12470.26 → 12472.32] I'm trying to find your basic boring silver computer.
[12472.32 → 12472.82] I'm working.
[12472.92 → 12473.62] I got it already.
[12473.72 → 12475.40] How much is his leg bouncing right now?
[12475.48 → 12476.16] I got it already.
[12476.16 → 12476.76] Is he shaking?
[12477.20 → 12477.44] Oh yeah.
[12477.48 → 12477.90] He's angry.
[12477.90 → 12478.26] No.
[12478.26 → 12480.90] Okay.
[12481.10 → 12482.42] So here's our judges.
[12483.92 → 12484.58] Hold on.
[12484.70 → 12485.28] Where is...
[12485.28 → 12485.44] Okay.
[12485.48 → 12486.34] So where's my machine?
[12487.08 → 12487.88] So...
[12487.88 → 12488.32] Oh look.
[12488.44 → 12493.78] A silver computer versus one that's on fire in the background with pistons on it.
[12494.72 → 12494.90] Yeah.
[12495.02 → 12495.26] You...
[12495.26 → 12496.14] You...
[12496.14 → 12497.72] It doesn't seem very practical.
[12497.72 → 12500.26] You put the p*** off in pistons.
[12500.38 → 12500.76] I did.
[12501.40 → 12502.26] It's ridiculous dude.
[12502.26 → 12503.22] I'm not going to ding that.
[12503.32 → 12503.54] Okay.
[12503.58 → 12504.06] Hold on.
[12504.18 → 12504.48] Yeah.
[12504.64 → 12504.80] Wow.
[12505.84 → 12506.12] Okay.
[12506.24 → 12506.68] Man.
[12506.78 → 12507.38] We never...
[12507.38 → 12509.58] It's freaking scrapyard wars man.
[12509.74 → 12509.86] We like...
[12509.86 → 12511.36] There's never glam footage.
[12512.24 → 12513.78] What do the systems look like?
[12513.92 → 12514.38] Oh.
[12514.66 → 12515.20] Hold on.
[12515.20 → 12516.14] Man.
[12516.18 → 12519.12] It's amazing that we're a video production company at all.
[12519.12 → 12519.84] Ours was so cool.
[12519.86 → 12520.60] It's still on fire?
[12520.68 → 12521.66] It didn't have to be on fire.
[12521.66 → 12523.14] How long does it burn for?
[12523.14 → 12524.00] It had fuel in it.
[12524.00 → 12524.54] A long time.
[12524.60 → 12524.76] Yeah.
[12525.02 → 12526.20] It was like a tiki thing.
[12526.28 → 12526.74] It was stupid.
[12526.94 → 12528.32] You didn't have to have it on fire.
[12528.38 → 12529.86] It was able to be not on fire.
[12530.22 → 12536.82] How did we go from this to the finale without ever actually seeing the damn systems?
[12536.82 → 12537.82] So that it just ends.
[12542.50 → 12542.90] Wow.
[12543.28 → 12544.32] You know how it ends?
[12544.48 → 12544.70] Here.
[12544.78 → 12545.08] Hold on.
[12545.14 → 12546.60] I think I can see how it ends here.
[12546.76 → 12547.00] Oh.
[12547.10 → 12547.56] What was this?
[12548.26 → 12548.58] Wait.
[12549.24 → 12550.14] You guys won.
[12550.48 → 12551.58] What are you even talking about?
[12551.64 → 12552.70] What are you even mad about?
[12552.90 → 12553.50] I don't think so.
[12553.52 → 12553.54] Oh no.
[12553.54 → 12553.84] We won.
[12554.34 → 12554.74] Wow.
[12554.82 → 12555.70] By 0.8.
[12555.74 → 12556.70] No wonder you're mad.
[12556.70 → 12557.04] Yeah.
[12557.90 → 12558.34] Garbage.
[12559.12 → 12560.92] And on your home turf too.
[12561.22 → 12561.38] Yeah.
[12561.44 → 12562.22] My parents house.
[12562.26 → 12565.84] We were in Luke's parents garage, and he had to lose there.
[12565.84 → 12567.06] Oh that's rough dude.
[12568.38 → 12569.58] I feel bad for you.
[12569.80 → 12570.10] Yeah.
[12570.20 → 12571.06] Well it's a scam.
[12572.42 → 12573.90] It's just actually a scam.
[12574.10 → 12575.68] Don't feel bad for you.
[12575.68 → 12575.90] I got a clarinet.
[12578.54 → 12580.68] You're still paying off the interest on that one.
[12580.84 → 12580.94] Okay.
[12582.64 → 12583.44] I am.
[12584.18 → 12585.64] I'm very delinquent.
[12585.76 → 12586.72] Emotional dick.
[12586.80 → 12591.70] I like this concept with having to watch the judges look at them and us just being a reaction cam though.
[12592.46 → 12592.70] Yeah.
[12593.98 → 12595.26] Why do you have a before?
[12595.26 → 12595.98] That's stupid.
[12596.12 → 12597.44] You can't show the before of what it.
[12598.08 → 12599.40] I don't know what the before is out.
[12599.48 → 12600.30] Did we do that?
[12600.50 → 12601.42] I don't remember that at all.
[12602.32 → 12602.68] Apparently.
[12602.78 → 12604.86] I think you were just showing off that you had extra hardware.
[12605.28 → 12609.98] Maybe if you'd spent all the money on the hardware you actually presented to the judges you might have won.
[12610.60 → 12611.18] We probably.
[12611.32 → 12612.68] If we did we probably got it for free.
[12612.80 → 12614.26] I think we were pretty scrappy that season.
[12614.56 → 12614.72] Yeah.
[12614.76 → 12617.86] And I don't think anyone had introduced the meta of selling stuff yet.
[12617.92 → 12618.66] I don't think so.
[12619.26 → 12622.22] I think that was the Jay and Dimitri.
[12622.22 → 12624.34] That might be right.
[12624.90 → 12625.96] I think that's when that started.
[12626.08 → 12626.24] Okay.
[12626.36 → 12627.18] So hold on.
[12627.28 → 12629.40] Oh look how classy this machine looks though.
[12629.86 → 12630.72] Boring dude.
[12630.84 → 12631.74] But look how classy it is.
[12631.74 → 12633.94] It looks like it came off a shelf at a store.
[12633.94 → 12634.54] Exactly.
[12634.54 → 12635.96] Except it didn't.
[12635.96 → 12636.34] That's so boring.
[12636.54 → 12637.26] Except it didn't.
[12637.38 → 12639.78] Yeah imagine doing all that work to make it look normal.
[12639.90 → 12644.96] It was so garbage before we got it and now look how classy it looks.
[12644.96 → 12645.20] Look how normal it looks.
[12645.28 → 12646.14] Water cooled.
[12646.58 → 12647.56] Liquid cooled.
[12647.84 → 12649.24] That's custom by the way.
[12649.56 → 12651.14] That custom liquid cooling.
[12651.22 → 12652.34] Look how normal it looks.
[12652.34 → 12657.36] It was an AIO, and then we used clear tubing to make it not an AIO.
[12657.50 → 12660.80] I don't even want it to bake because I'm just so bored looking at that boring computer.
[12660.80 → 12661.98] Wow.
[12664.10 → 12664.58] Anyway.
[12665.36 → 12665.96] We can move on.
[12666.16 → 12666.30] Jeez.
[12667.80 → 12669.22] Hey TLA watching from Japan.
[12669.38 → 12670.44] Question for Luke.
[12670.66 → 12673.40] I'm a lead at a startup using float planes stack.
[12673.40 → 12680.04] How strictly do you enforce folder file structure linting and code consistency versus shipping fast?
[12680.42 → 12681.32] More so.
[12681.66 → 12682.82] First one then the other.
[12683.88 → 12686.86] Shipping fast for a long time and then realizing.
[12687.26 → 12687.64] Yeah.
[12688.12 → 12690.06] We do a lot more now.
[12690.80 → 12694.34] I didn't say tests or test driven development.
[12694.52 → 12695.58] We don't go that far.
[12696.04 → 12696.86] Well we do.
[12696.94 → 12701.88] We do have some tests, but we don't do test driven development or 100% test coverage or anything like that.
[12702.70 → 12704.04] Far from it really.
[12704.24 → 12706.70] But I think that's fine.
[12706.88 → 12707.54] Do you lint?
[12707.70 → 12708.02] Yes.
[12708.02 → 12713.08] And we are slowly improving that over time.
[12713.08 → 12721.28] I know Jaden's doing a ton of work right now trying to get like some of the last bits fully properly listed.
[12722.36 → 12724.42] Which will be nice.
[12724.62 → 12725.56] It'll be good.
[12725.56 → 12731.00] And then from there on we should be able to continue with 100% listed code.
[12731.00 → 12742.52] That's been a many years long project because it's been one of those things where like just we never pursued 100% all at once.
[12742.52 → 12747.10] We would do like okay we're going to work on this project that touches this part of the code base.
[12747.24 → 12749.08] We will glint this part of the code base.
[12749.24 → 12750.74] And then we move along.
[12750.80 → 12754.48] And it just ends up being like a little adder onto feature requests.
[12754.48 → 12763.04] Which allowed us to keep releasing things that would either make you know creators or users or developers or whatever happy.
[12764.48 → 12766.86] But progressing on this goal at the same time.
[12767.58 → 12770.08] And a lot of that has been driven by Jaden.
[12770.16 → 12770.96] He's been doing great with it.
[12771.26 → 12773.70] So that's where we're at with that.
[12775.06 → 12775.18] Yeah.
[12776.46 → 12781.92] What technology do you feel is taken for granted and underrated in 2025?
[12782.54 → 12783.80] Honestly almost all of it.
[12783.80 → 12785.28] I think it is.
[12785.28 → 12785.86] Oh hell yeah.
[12786.12 → 12796.40] I think it's as much as it pains me that a top of the line GPU for like consumer grade GPU starts at $2,000 US dollars and goes up to $3,000 US dollars.
[12796.58 → 12800.76] Like if you showed that to someone when I was a kid.
[12801.50 → 12807.82] Like if you and as much as modern games aren't optimized enough and developers are lazy.
[12808.48 → 12810.98] Like dude if you showed up.
[12811.04 → 12813.76] What was what was it Borderlands 4?
[12813.80 → 12814.92] That's been under fire lately.
[12814.92 → 12820.38] If you showed Borderlands 4 to me when I was a kid I would think you were God.
[12820.78 → 12825.84] Like I wouldn't even I wouldn't even be able to fully comprehend what I was looking at.
[12826.08 → 12829.18] I think we've gotten extremely.
[12829.18 → 12838.82] Entitled when it comes to the the the technology that we just well take for granted that was the question.
[12839.46 → 12844.50] I think we take it for granted that doesn't mean that as consumers we shouldn't demand better.
[12844.50 → 12853.30] I mean I was pretty upset when Apple made the AirPods Pro 3 downgraded from the AirPods Pro 2 in some key ways that mattered a lot to me.
[12853.30 → 12865.02] We should we should definitely you know hold trillion-dollar companies accountable when they do things that make their products worse or make our lives worse.
[12865.02 → 12878.52] Um but broadly speaking yeah I think we just kind of take for granted that there's a computer in our pocket and another one on our wrist and another one in our backpack and another one on our desk at home.
[12878.52 → 12884.62] Like dude entire families had one PC and that was when you were doing really well when I was a kid you know.
[12886.30 → 12887.52] So all of it.
[12889.08 → 12890.90] Technology is so cool man.
[12891.76 → 12904.22] Like freaking like you ever just like hold a CPU and go like oh my God like there are physical features in this that are built literally on a scale of like actual atoms.
[12904.22 → 12910.80] Oh my God how is this attainable at something even remotely approaching a consumer price.
[12910.92 → 12913.60] How is this not exclusive to world governments.
[12914.68 → 12916.00] Like it's its amazing.
[12916.24 → 12918.94] You started going into it, but I was going to specifically say CPUs.
[12919.28 → 12919.54] Yeah.
[12919.74 → 12923.08] Or like I know silicon based processors.
[12923.34 → 12923.56] Yeah anything.
[12924.22 → 12924.82] Microprocessors whatever.
[12925.28 → 12931.92] It's the manufacturing that goes into them and then the fact that you can buy them for like a few hundred dollars.
[12932.36 → 12932.68] Yeah.
[12932.68 → 12934.88] It's a few hundred dollars.
[12935.08 → 12942.34] But what goes into it is billions of dollars like the craziest thing humans have done.
[12943.30 → 12947.84] And then it's like a consumer good like that's wild.
[12947.84 → 12955.64] Amazing that it ever achieved such scale to be able to reach the economies we have today at all.
[12955.92 → 12960.84] And with remarkable ASML and all these guys the ramp of.
[12960.84 → 12965.32] Of the process involved is nuts.
[12965.32 → 12975.50] Like back in the day they dip wafers by hand into chemical baths and like it was this it was this like very science-y kind of process.
[12975.50 → 12983.76] And now you have just these boxes of mystery and amazing science comes out the other end and there isn't even anyone in the room.
[12983.76 → 12985.76] Like whoa.
[12986.08 → 12986.44] Incredible.
[12986.44 → 12994.50] Ninja Man away says the AirPods Pro 3 reaction caused quite a stir in the audio file community.
[12995.36 → 12996.24] Yeah sure did.
[12997.28 → 13001.00] And apparently clinical uploaded a video today.
[13003.00 → 13005.02] Ninja Man says yeah I saw that video.
[13005.12 → 13005.52] It was wild.
[13005.66 → 13008.88] There was no pushback on CREN for essentially what DMS and Linus said.
[13008.88 → 13010.36] That's hilarious.
[13010.90 → 13013.68] I actually I haven't had a chance to check out clinical video yet.
[13013.68 → 13015.40] I'll have to I'll have to watch it.
[13017.14 → 13017.94] Oh well.
[13020.58 → 13022.50] The most important question.
[13022.68 → 13025.38] Did you get Alex's invitation to jam some tape to tape.
[13025.84 → 13028.94] Oh I'd be in that's that that's my invitation.
[13029.26 → 13034.62] We actually we played for the first time like I think like a week before he left or something like that.
[13034.62 → 13036.62] And on his last day I was like we should play tape to tape.
[13036.82 → 13038.16] I haven't played Alex.
[13038.76 → 13040.58] I haven't played any tape to tape lately.
[13040.58 → 13043.82] Mark's been busy which I'm sure is relatable.
[13047.60 → 13049.14] Based on your.
[13049.32 → 13049.98] But yes I'm down.
[13050.44 → 13050.60] Okay.
[13052.52 → 13055.88] Based on your metrics on YouTube or Flow plane.
[13056.22 → 13059.52] What's the weirdest type of device someone has used to watch LTT?
[13060.26 → 13062.34] I don't know if we would really have a ton of insight.
[13062.42 → 13063.36] We see browser but.
[13063.36 → 13064.68] If I remember correctly.
[13065.54 → 13065.94] We.
[13066.66 → 13068.52] Joked about this a long time ago.
[13068.96 → 13072.84] And then people did a fridge and a DS or something.
[13073.06 → 13073.26] Nice.
[13074.30 → 13075.32] DS is pretty good.
[13075.40 → 13076.38] I'm taking DS.
[13077.04 → 13077.60] That's sick.
[13077.66 → 13078.82] I think that was it.
[13079.66 → 13080.10] Yeah.
[13082.76 → 13083.18] Sorry.
[13083.30 → 13084.74] I was replying to one here.
[13084.88 → 13085.54] One second.
[13087.10 → 13087.52] Yeah.
[13087.62 → 13087.90] Crystal.
[13088.02 → 13089.68] I played a week ago at a LAN.
[13089.86 → 13091.28] I was playing with local people.
[13091.70 → 13092.32] Come on.
[13092.42 → 13092.58] Yeah.
[13092.58 → 13093.36] Doesn't count.
[13094.76 → 13095.46] Hey Wan.
[13095.58 → 13099.60] Considering Nvidia's recent buy-in of Intel.
[13100.04 → 13102.38] What's your take on the long-term prospects of ARK?
[13102.64 → 13107.12] Do you still have hope for ARK as a potential competition for AMD and Nvidia in discrete GPU market?
[13107.26 → 13108.54] I mean I'm hoping for the best man.
[13108.66 → 13111.10] My take hasn't really changed on all of this.
[13111.10 → 13116.44] Back when I said this is not financial advice, and it's especially not financial advice today.
[13116.86 → 13119.66] But I think long Intel is a good bet.
[13120.10 → 13123.88] That wouldn't have paid off as well as Nvidia back when I said it.
[13123.88 → 13132.14] But the reasons that I gave for very, very long Intel were many of them still valid today.
[13132.26 → 13134.10] I said I believed in Pat's vision.
[13134.20 → 13135.70] Unfortunately, that one's not valid.
[13135.70 → 13155.38] But all the other things that I brought up around the geopolitical importance of Intel being functionally the only non-Southeast Asian cutting edge semiconductor manufacturer have actually come to be true.
[13155.38 → 13177.66] I mean literally the U.S. government put billions of dollars into Intel to make sure that China can't just take a little rowboat across that tiny little strip of water and completely invalidate any attempts at U.S. sanctions on semiconductor products forevermore.
[13177.66 → 13193.40] Yeah, everything I said then was still true except for I believe in Pat's vision, and now I just have no idea what the vision is.
[13193.46 → 13204.24] I'm still hoping that ARK will stick around, but I can't, yeah I can't, I really hope ARK, discrete ARK sticks around.
[13204.24 → 13218.24] I mean with AI being what it is, man, do I hope the bubble lasts for long enough for Intel to like maybe make a little bit of money on ARK GPUs for AI?
[13218.68 → 13220.92] Yo, like Battle Matrix, dude?
[13221.26 → 13222.74] Battle Matrix, super cool.
[13224.20 → 13226.60] I hope so, man.
[13226.60 → 13239.94] I hope that AI gives it a reason for them to keep putting money into it long enough that the gaming cards can reach a break-even point where just, where at the very least they can just ignore it, and it can keep doing its thing in the corner.
[13240.08 → 13240.70] That'll be awesome.
[13241.04 → 13242.64] That's my best, that's my best case.
[13242.64 → 13245.66] They're going to have to get off of 0% market share.
[13245.70 → 13246.66] Yeah, they'll have to do that.
[13247.38 → 13250.14] Okay, hey, is it time for our weekly ARK Watch?
[13250.74 → 13251.44] Ah, yes.
[13252.66 → 13253.56] Let's go.
[13254.60 → 13255.20] ARK Watch.
[13255.20 → 13264.22] I don't think the NVIDIA investment thing is gonna change the path for ARK GPUs.
[13265.72 → 13269.82] If ARK GPUs no longer become a thing, I don't think it's going to be because of that.
[13270.14 → 13273.00] And I really, really, really hope that they continue being a thing.
[13273.04 → 13273.98] Okay, this is big dumb.
[13274.08 → 13274.76] This is misleading.
[13274.94 → 13276.24] This is not $90 off.
[13276.24 → 13279.70] The MSRP of the ARK B580 is $250.
[13280.14 → 13287.08] But you can buy an Onyx Odyssey ARK B580 for $249.99.
[13287.08 → 13292.60] And you can pay in four interest-free payments of $62.50.
[13292.60 → 13301.20] I am throwing back to an earlier conversation on the show.
[13301.90 → 13303.58] That is not a suggestion.
[13304.26 → 13307.36] That is not a recommendation.
[13307.36 → 13321.36] But if you have $250 in your pocket right now, and if you need a pretty decent 1440p or really excellent 1080p gaming GPU, and if you...
[13321.36 → 13326.80] Or if you want to be a crazy person and have lossless scaling stuff going on.
[13327.82 → 13329.32] Free 3D Mark?
[13329.54 → 13329.72] Ugh.
[13329.72 → 13332.80] Definitely not as good as that Battlefield deal, but...
[13332.80 → 13333.86] That was a crazy deal.
[13333.92 → 13334.78] That was a perfect deal.
[13335.48 → 13336.26] What else we got?
[13336.36 → 13338.16] AS Rock has one for $269.99.
[13338.34 → 13339.14] That's pretty close.
[13339.32 → 13343.08] It has 50% more fans for only, you know, 8% more dollars.
[13343.20 → 13344.30] So I guess that's a deal.
[13345.58 → 13346.30] Oh, wow.
[13346.40 → 13351.44] Those reference cards are not available first party from New egg.
[13351.44 → 13353.54] Remember, that one was going during Intel Gamer deals?
[13354.74 → 13357.56] Like a thousand of them were in the card or something like that.
[13357.84 → 13358.68] Whatever it was.
[13360.34 → 13365.24] Man, I can't believe we're doing this again without me figuring out if we have a New egg affiliate.
[13366.98 → 13371.40] Remember, we probably sold like a thousand GPUs that one WAN show, and I was like, hey, do we have an affiliate link?
[13371.50 → 13373.06] And then I was like, I should look that up.
[13373.26 → 13374.08] Let's do that every week.
[13374.52 → 13374.76] Yeah.
[13375.76 → 13377.20] Yeah, so I got one part of it.
[13377.24 → 13379.34] I got the part where we just do this every week.
[13379.36 → 13380.70] I didn't get the part where we make any money.
[13381.18 → 13381.88] But you know what?
[13381.88 → 13382.60] It doesn't matter.
[13383.08 → 13388.24] It doesn't matter because you can get an AS Rock Challenger B580 for $259.99.
[13388.24 → 13391.96] And check out Game Sale.
[13392.04 → 13392.82] That's not a deal.
[13393.20 → 13394.22] Don't forget your OS.
[13394.50 → 13395.26] Get this out of here.
[13395.66 → 13397.64] The point is, ARK.
[13398.44 → 13399.28] $259.99.
[13399.48 → 13400.24] $249.99.
[13400.58 → 13401.64] You can buy one right now.
[13402.00 → 13404.04] I really, really want Intel to survive.
[13404.04 → 13407.16] We need somebody to keep NVIDIA honest.
[13407.36 → 13412.12] And AMD is clearly not up to the challenge.
[13413.42 → 13414.64] Hi, LLD.
[13414.98 → 13419.82] Finally got Allies SG10 Copper Edition case.
[13419.90 → 13420.94] That's the fanless one.
[13421.92 → 13425.70] Do you have any tips and recommendations for building in it?
[13425.88 → 13426.58] Have fun.
[13426.98 → 13429.04] Dude, it's such a cool case.
[13429.14 → 13429.76] It's so cool.
[13429.84 → 13430.52] Take your time.
[13431.20 → 13432.02] Go slow.
[13432.30 → 13433.62] It's really heavy.
[13434.44 → 13435.26] Don't be...
[13435.26 → 13437.94] Go into it fully understanding.
[13438.46 → 13439.90] Like, I would build the whole thing.
[13440.68 → 13445.72] And then I would make the assumption that when I'm done building,
[13446.22 → 13450.76] I'm going to want to tear it all down and do it again with everything I learned the first time.
[13450.76 → 13453.84] Because it really is not a for beginners build.
[13454.22 → 13454.30] At all.
[13454.30 → 13457.26] With it being that open, the cable management's got to be crazy.
[13457.54 → 13460.14] Oh, and everything about it is crazy.
[13460.28 → 13461.10] It's really cool.
[13462.56 → 13464.12] And last one I got for you today.
[13464.52 → 13465.44] Hey, Linus.
[13465.44 → 13469.52] For kids, do you recommend an Apple Watch in Canada?
[13469.94 → 13473.56] The plan is only about $10 a month and there's no access to the web,
[13473.72 → 13477.62] but it can still be located and called with texting.
[13478.20 → 13481.12] Honestly, that was a big part of Apple's pitch for the new SE.
[13481.84 → 13481.98] Oh.
[13481.98 → 13483.30] It was like for kids.
[13483.76 → 13487.64] And it seems like a pretty compelling price.
[13488.04 → 13488.82] That seems pretty cool.
[13488.82 → 13489.22] Yeah.
[13491.62 → 13495.14] With that said, you know, you could get a lot more functionality
[13495.14 → 13499.04] with like a cheap secondhand Android phone for that same amount of money.
[13499.16 → 13503.42] But if what you're after is for them to not have the functionality.
[13504.62 → 13505.40] Seems like the goal.
[13505.50 → 13506.62] Not a ton of other options.
[13506.84 → 13514.52] Like the dumb phone market seems to have gone like super upscale over the last few years.
[13514.56 → 13515.16] You notice that?
[13515.16 → 13520.54] Like they went from being these super affordable, non-featured devices
[13520.54 → 13522.88] where the whole point was that they're cheap and cheerful.
[13523.24 → 13525.16] And now they're like bogie.
[13525.88 → 13527.52] I don't think that's true of all of them.
[13527.58 → 13528.68] Just the ones getting headlines.
[13529.04 → 13531.58] So yeah, if you wanted it, if you're into it.
[13531.82 → 13536.32] The nice thing about the Apple Watch is Apple has done a very good job of supporting them
[13536.32 → 13537.54] over an extended period of time.
[13537.64 → 13539.52] So by the time your kids are ready for a smartphone,
[13540.08 → 13542.12] then they can just pair it to their phone
[13542.12 → 13544.28] and they can just keep using that same watch, probably.
[13545.16 → 13547.52] That's all I got.
[13548.72 → 13551.02] And that's all I got for you.
[13551.84 → 13554.22] Until next week, same bad time.
[13554.96 → 13555.54] Same bad channel!
[13556.12 → 13556.48] Bye!
[13556.48 → 13556.66] Bye!
[13561.46 → 13562.70] How long was that show?
[13565.24 → 13566.66] Oh my god, how'd that happen?
[13567.94 → 13568.74] I believe it.
[13568.74 → 13569.92] Bye!
[13569.92 → 13569.98] Bye!
[13569.98 → 13570.02] Bye!

[13576.22 → 13576.76] Bye!
[13583.02 → 13583.76] Bye!
[13594.40 → 13597.30] Bye!
[13597.30 → 13597.36] Bye!
[13597.36 → 13597.72] Bye!
[13597.72 → 13598.12] Bye!
[13598.18 → 13598.78] Bye!
[13598.78 → 13598.90] Bye!
[13600.74 → 13600.86] Bye!
[13600.88 → 13602.78] Bye!
[13603.16 → 13603.78] Bye!
[13603.78 → 13604.26] Bye!
