[0.00 → 7.16] Today, um, we'll be talking about why I'm so sleep-deprived that I'm basically mildly intoxicated.
[8.84 → 12.78] We'll also be talking about, uh,
[13.36 → 21.42] Ah yes, ah yes, we issued a correction to one of our videos this week.
[21.70 → 25.00] The whole process was very efficient and made a ton of sense.
[25.00 → 32.48] Yeah, uh, also the EU says that Apple can make a portless iPhone and is Steam coming to Xbox?
[33.18 → 34.32] Really? That's what you picked?
[34.40 → 34.96] That's weird.
[35.14 → 38.56] Portless, portless iPhone and Xbox Steam.
[38.72 → 39.56] Yeah, what would you do?
[39.64 → 45.40] I don't know, uh, sublimated iPhone and, uh, portless Xbox.
[47.88 → 49.28] Ah, it's going to be a show today.
[53.84 → 54.36] Ugh.
[55.00 → 61.54] I'm powerless.
[68.32 → 74.00] The show is brought to you today by Squarespace, uh, Messi and Thrum.
[74.34 → 75.06] Wait, what?
[75.20 → 77.28] What is this jerky doing here then?
[77.92 → 80.88] It's also brought to you by our rap partner, Brand.
[81.98 → 83.10] Laptop partner, Dell.
[83.10 → 86.98] Yes, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[87.16 → 89.64] They won't tell me why the jerky's here.
[89.64 → 92.82] And then, yeah, we genuinely have no idea why that's there.
[92.86 → 94.30] It's because we're the boys.
[95.68 → 97.18] And we make prank calls.
[97.80 → 98.22] I don't know.
[98.32 → 99.02] It doesn't matter.
[99.52 → 99.84] What?
[100.26 → 102.80] It was a thing in, like, the early 2000s.
[102.96 → 103.98] You kicked my dog.
[103.98 → 107.34] Okay, I remember the prank calls, but what does that have to do with jerky?
[107.74 → 108.84] Because you're jerky.
[110.02 → 111.14] Just because we're jerky.
[111.14 → 113.64] No, that's what they were called, the jerky boys.
[113.86 → 114.40] Oh, okay.
[114.44 → 115.10] I didn't know that.
[115.44 → 115.54] Okay.
[115.76 → 116.90] Does that warrant a bell?
[117.28 → 118.66] I don't think so.
[118.92 → 120.30] You get one of these.
[120.30 → 126.20] Look, I've slept, like, five hours in the last two days.
[127.52 → 136.36] And I made the extremely, extremely poor choices move of having a nap, like, an hour and a half
[136.36 → 144.86] ago, and so I just got back from at least three countries.
[145.66 → 147.66] Singapore, I think, is a country, right?
[147.80 → 147.96] Yeah.
[148.12 → 150.34] I mean, in Civ, it's a city-state.
[150.82 → 151.86] Are they countries?
[152.20 → 154.48] I love geographical knowledge coming from Civ.
[154.54 → 157.62] Well, that's the only place I get it after school.
[157.90 → 162.52] And I had a literally useless social studies teacher, so I'm just going based on what Mr.
[162.60 → 165.04] Sid Meier, Professor Meier taught me.
[165.04 → 166.52] It's a country.
[167.44 → 167.88] Wonderful.
[168.10 → 169.70] Then I was just in three countries.
[169.94 → 173.02] This was probably the most hectic vacation that I've ever been on.
[173.18 → 175.52] It was much harder work than being in office.
[175.74 → 178.30] I'm actually extremely grateful to be back at work.
[180.70 → 182.42] You know how long we were gone.
[182.52 → 185.78] We were gone for, I think, 12 days or something like that.
[186.14 → 188.36] We stayed in six different hotels.
[188.66 → 189.10] Whoa.
[189.10 → 192.42] And I was there with the whole, not, no, I mean the whole family.
[192.42 → 200.80] Like, my nuclear family, my sister-in-law and like her kids and everything and my in-laws.
[201.42 → 205.40] So my wife's parents and my sister-in-law's parents.
[206.68 → 208.02] It's a lot of people.
[208.02 → 209.38] My children's grandparents.
[209.88 → 211.74] Between hotels every two days.
[211.74 → 216.36] And there was a lot of like family reuniting and, you know, stuff.
[217.36 → 221.80] And there was a lot of, my wife is a bit of a type A.
[221.80 → 229.56] And so a lot of like, okay, today we're hitting the bird sanctuary, and then we're going to hit the something.
[229.86 → 237.24] Anyway, the point is that I'm going to try to tell you everywhere that I stayed, and I will probably get it wrong.
[237.60 → 237.88] Got it.
[238.58 → 239.78] I already forget.
[240.12 → 241.56] But we definitely started.
[241.84 → 242.66] No, stop.
[242.80 → 243.98] We definitely started.
[244.12 → 246.26] We started in Bali.
[246.26 → 250.14] So we started in Indonesia and that was cool.
[251.00 → 251.60] I don't know.
[251.64 → 253.94] Maybe next week I'll show you guys some pictures or something.
[254.04 → 255.08] It'll be, it'll be pretty cool.
[255.46 → 257.14] Oh, those were awesome, actually.
[257.28 → 257.48] Yeah.
[257.48 → 258.30] The place looked sweet.
[258.42 → 258.60] Yeah.
[258.78 → 260.72] The bird sanctuary seemed super cool.
[261.00 → 261.14] Yeah.
[261.20 → 266.36] So we'll, so yeah, we were in Bali, and then we went to Malaysia.
[266.98 → 270.44] First to port something, port Dixon.
[270.64 → 271.22] That's right.
[271.22 → 278.94] Um, and then we went to Kuala Lumpur, and then we went to Singapore, and then we came to home.
[279.08 → 285.24] And, uh, the reason that I didn't kind of address it on WAN show last week is I strongly prefer,
[285.46 → 290.46] you know, when we're on vacation to kind of tell you guys that once I'm back.
[290.84 → 297.24] Um, but I didn't really get an opportunity to not have people know that I was on vacation overseas
[297.24 → 301.22] with my family because it blew up on our slash Malaysia.
[301.72 → 301.98] Yeah.
[302.20 → 302.52] Yeah.
[302.66 → 306.98] Um, so yeah, I guess, I guess why don't I, why don't I talk about the, uh, the tech mall
[306.98 → 313.78] that I went to, I have now completed more than a trifecta of sick Asian tech malls.
[313.78 → 316.70] So I've been to, and I'm going to butcher this.
[316.70 → 319.86] It's like Was Huang Bay or something like that.
[319.86 → 323.48] I, I could have looked up what it was called again before the show.
[323.48 → 327.52] In fact, I may have, but I wouldn't remember it if I did.
[327.70 → 331.72] So whatever the one that's in, um, oh crap.
[331.84 → 332.02] Wow.
[332.02 → 333.00] My brain is so bad.
[333.08 → 334.64] The, the, the, the, the, the Chinese tech.
[334.70 → 335.02] Shenzhen?
[335.26 → 335.54] Yes.
[335.62 → 336.04] Thank you.
[336.10 → 336.44] Shenzhen.
[336.78 → 339.88] Uh, so I went to that one with Scotty from strange parts.
[339.88 → 340.98] That was really cool.
[340.98 → 345.30] Uh, I went to Slim Square in Singapore, like nine years ago.
[345.30 → 349.04] The last time I went and visited Yvonne's family in Southeast Asia.
[349.04 → 356.96] Um, I went to that sick tech mall in, um, Taipei last time I was there in Taiwan, uh, last year.
[356.96 → 362.66] And then now I've been to, um, Plaza Low At.
[362.82 → 366.16] I just remember that I was trying not to gain weight on this trip.
[366.52 → 368.24] And so I'm like, oh yeah.
[368.48 → 371.14] Uh, so I picked the low, low At Plaza.
[371.76 → 374.10] So like low fat.
[374.40 → 376.78] Oh, I thought you were speaking.
[376.78 → 378.82] Speaking of fat.
[378.82 → 381.16] Uh, is that a thing?
[382.02 → 383.56] Uh, sort of.
[383.84 → 384.48] No At?
[384.74 → 385.74] At means like butt.
[385.74 → 386.90] I know what that means.
[387.02 → 387.30] So.
[387.42 → 388.00] You after.
[388.52 → 388.98] Like a.
[389.22 → 389.42] Yeah.
[389.58 → 389.94] Okay.
[390.06 → 392.42] Anyway, the point is, uh, Plaza Low At.
[392.62 → 393.98] Um, super cool.
[394.38 → 400.86] Um, shout out the guys at the top of the escalators that like, like try and make sure if you want
[400.86 → 402.48] to buy a laptop, do you want to buy a laptop?
[402.76 → 405.02] Um, everyone else was super cool.
[406.64 → 407.80] That's so aggressive.
[407.80 → 408.50] Oh dude.
[409.22 → 411.52] Like what are the odds I'm here for a laptop?
[411.52 → 412.62] Especially that one.
[412.72 → 414.68] There's literally everything in this place.
[414.82 → 416.80] You probably want to like to browse a little bit.
[416.92 → 417.12] Yeah.
[417.30 → 418.16] Uh, no dude.
[418.24 → 419.72] They're, they're like, they're crazy.
[420.24 → 421.90] Um, yeah.
[421.90 → 423.96] But other than that, man, it was super cool.
[423.96 → 429.00] I, the reason that I went there was not to make a video because I was on vacation, but
[429.00 → 434.50] I, I happened to have one of our little audio recorder things with me because Elijah needed
[434.50 → 435.64] a clip of me on a beach.
[435.64 → 440.04] And I was like, well, what better place to get that than when I'm sure on the beach in,
[440.04 → 443.28] I guess that was in Bali when I recorded that one.
[443.28 → 444.16] I think, I don't know.
[444.22 → 446.00] The whole thing's kind of blur to be honest with you.
[446.50 → 450.36] Um, so, so anyway, I had one of my little audio recorders and like I'm dairying an iPhone.
[450.36 → 453.64] So I just gave Yvonne my iPhone and we, uh, right.
[453.64 → 455.68] That's not the part of the story I was on yet.
[455.80 → 461.02] So the reason I decided to make a video was because I needed a micro HDMI cable.
[461.38 → 468.42] I made the same mistake that I have made previously bringing my DOG, uh, portable display for the
[468.42 → 471.20] plane to kind of set up in the middle, so the kids can play games.
[471.70 → 479.16] And, uh, it takes a micro HDMI input or a type C input, but because I have a first generation
[479.16 → 486.70] ally and also a switch, um, there's no way on either of those devices to charge that device
[486.70 → 490.18] while also outputting type C to the display.
[490.84 → 495.66] I couldn't output from the switch at all because I forgot a micro HDMI adapter cable.
[495.80 → 500.36] And I didn't bring an HDMI cable at all because I assumed that my hotel rooms would have HDMI
[500.36 → 505.36] cables between whatever streaming box and the TV, which actually only half of them did.
[506.20 → 508.84] So midway through the trip, I'm like, okay, I'm getting a bloody
[508.84 → 512.96] HDMI cable, and I'm getting that micro HDMI adapter so that we can hook the display up
[512.96 → 518.10] to the switch, or I can power my display and output from the ally at the same time.
[518.10 → 520.08] Cause the first gen ally only has one type C.
[520.42 → 524.50] So on a new ally, you'd be able to just output to the display, power the display like that,
[524.50 → 526.52] and then plug in the power to the ally.
[526.58 → 529.22] And then you could have continuous power delivery all the way through.
[529.60 → 534.74] I think, because I don't know, that display is kind of funky because I tried to power it and
[534.74 → 536.98] then also USB-C output into it.
[537.06 → 542.38] And then my ally started going, like it was getting into like charging mode all the time.
[542.38 → 545.88] And then I had my phone plugged into it, and I was running my finger along the side of it.
[545.88 → 548.46] And it was like, like a weird feeling.
[548.54 → 548.82] I don't know.
[548.90 → 551.64] Maybe my charger wasn't grounded properly or something like that.
[551.68 → 557.24] Anyway, the point is, the point is I needed a cable and what better place to go than it
[557.24 → 562.56] turns out the huge tech mall that was literally a seven-minute walk from my hotel.
[562.76 → 566.68] So I went there, and I was like, well, this will be really simple.
[566.74 → 567.60] I'll just find a cable.
[568.68 → 571.92] I was like, okay, well, probably not just any shop.
[571.96 → 572.12] Okay.
[572.14 → 574.48] I'll go into like a camera shop because I need micro HDMI.
[574.48 → 578.06] And some cameras use that awful, awful standard just for space savings.
[578.54 → 581.84] And I went into one, and they were like, oh, that'll be $40.
[582.32 → 583.34] And I was like, oh, okay.
[583.34 → 588.52] You mean like, like local currency, like, yeah, Malaysian ringgit or whatever.
[588.52 → 593.26] And they're like, oh, uh, you know, no, I know 40, 40 us dollars.
[593.36 → 597.18] And I was like, excuse me for a micro HDMI cable.
[597.36 → 599.34] No, you have got to be kidding me right now.
[599.34 → 604.50] Like you can get adapters for like two bucks and then like a cable for, you know, five to
[604.50 → 604.84] 10.
[604.84 → 607.44] And that doesn't mean I expect to pay that at retail.
[607.68 → 611.52] Obviously there's, there's a convenience tax, but that was clearly a foreigner tax.
[611.52 → 613.78] And no, thank you.
[614.14 → 620.44] So I, so I kind of poked around and went onto a different floor and finally found a place
[620.44 → 625.50] that was basically like AliExpress, but in retail store, like they just had, you know,
[625.80 → 630.26] box of bulk cables here, box of other more different bulk cables there.
[630.34 → 632.12] And you could, it was, it was great.
[632.18 → 636.42] It was like the, the bulk candy aisle section at the supermarket, but for, for tech.
[636.42 → 639.26] Um, and then I found these other really cool stores.
[639.26 → 645.08] And then I noticed that so many of the shops had like 50 series in stock.
[645.14 → 650.56] Oh, even like 50 nineties, 50, 70 Tis, like actually like good ones.
[650.68 → 653.70] Uh, pricing was, uh, well, you know what?
[653.92 → 658.20] I'll, I'll save it for the video, but pricing was not what you would expect.
[658.20 → 666.50] Whatever you were expecting, probably it wasn't it, but like, dude, seriously, there were more
[666.50 → 673.68] 50 series and AMD 9,000 series cards in stock in that tech mall that I could probably find
[673.68 → 677.70] scouring the entire North American retail, like online inventory.
[677.70 → 683.18] Like I kid you not every single little hole in the wall shop had probably three to 10,
[683.18 → 686.74] 50 series cards and like a handful of 9,000 series.
[686.74 → 692.52] You know what could be, I don't know if it's worthy of a full format video, but it could be
[692.52 → 695.08] kind of interesting, um, at Computer.
[695.16 → 697.32] Like, can you find a GPU in Taiwan?
[698.00 → 698.26] Yeah.
[698.36 → 700.68] Because you can't find them in the States right now.
[700.68 → 702.36] You almost certainly could.
[702.68 → 703.04] I bet you can't.
[703.30 → 707.42] Uh, so anyway, I talk a little bit about, you know, what the, what the market dynamics
[707.42 → 709.94] that, you know, might be at play here are.
[709.94 → 713.74] Uh, one thing that I don't really touch on because it's like unscripted, and I'm just kind of
[713.74 → 715.74] walking around shooting little clips when I think of it.
[715.74 → 721.48] And I, and I didn't really think about it at the time, um, is that it could be strategic.
[721.48 → 727.76] Uh, it could be that if I'm, if I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to Nvidia and their
[727.76 → 735.66] board partners, sending a couple of GPUs to each of all of these retail shops, uh, limits
[735.66 → 741.28] the ability of someone like a minor or an AI farm or whatever to buy in bulk.
[741.28 → 748.88] It maximizes the opportunity for an individual gamer to go in and, and just, you know, buy
[748.88 → 750.26] a card and, and take it home.
[750.40 → 751.98] This is a big benefit of the doubt.
[752.14 → 754.44] But that's a huge benefit of the doubt thing.
[754.78 → 757.72] Um, so I, I, so I legitimately don't know.
[758.12 → 759.52] I don't know how it is.
[759.52 → 761.32] And I, like, I'm, I'm serious.
[761.70 → 765.82] I'm talking like the, the bigger shops had them, the, the more like, uh, you know, a
[765.82 → 769.94] Canada computers or memory express or like, like a tiny micro centre is probably the best
[769.94 → 771.04] way that I could describe them.
[771.28 → 778.42] Those guys had them, but especially what it was the little like hole in the wall shops.
[778.48 → 779.36] You know what I mean by that?
[779.36 → 779.54] Right?
[779.54 → 783.34] Like you go by, and it's basically a doorway and then like, that's it.
[783.60 → 785.34] It's like a long doorway essentially.
[785.34 → 786.30] It's effectively a closet.
[786.48 → 786.68] Yeah.
[786.86 → 787.62] Just a big one.
[787.78 → 791.70] Kind of like the one that I bought that super high-end gaming system from, uh, back when
[791.70 → 792.80] we did that Taiwan video.
[792.80 → 797.00] Uh, like it, and they'll, they'll just have a bunch of them on the shelf.
[797.06 → 798.08] I'm like, yo, are those boxes?
[798.16 → 798.88] They're like, yeah.
[799.06 → 800.20] And I'm like, right.
[800.20 → 801.80] But like, are they just boxes?
[801.92 → 803.66] They're like, no, they're just stuffing them.
[803.78 → 804.60] I'm like, oh yeah.
[804.68 → 804.96] Okay.
[805.18 → 805.90] Like what?
[806.34 → 807.44] You have to be kidding me.
[807.44 → 807.70] Right?
[808.12 → 809.10] That is pretty wild.
[809.54 → 809.90] Yeah.
[810.06 → 811.98] So I'd, so then, so then there was that.
[811.98 → 814.66] And then I was kind of going, well, okay.
[814.76 → 814.96] Yeah.
[814.96 → 816.58] This is probably a video at this point.
[816.58 → 821.82] Cause then I also needed my, uh, I wanted a switch doc, but not like, you know, the big
[821.82 → 823.32] chunky first party doc.
[823.36 → 825.28] Because I brought a doc with me.
[825.28 → 826.84] The first party doc like actually sucks.
[826.96 → 827.14] Yeah.
[827.20 → 829.82] I brought a doc with me, but it wasn't working.
[829.82 → 833.96] And I, I, I have two docs at home that I bought off like AliExpress or something.
[833.96 → 835.50] And one of them works and one of them doesn't.
[835.62 → 837.26] And I gambled and I lost.
[837.52 → 838.76] I brought the one that didn't work.
[838.76 → 839.42] And I don't know.
[839.42 → 840.90] It probably worked at some point.
[841.12 → 843.92] Like it probably worked with the non OLED version or something.
[843.92 → 844.48] I don't know.
[844.48 → 846.88] But the point is I tried it on the trip.
[846.96 → 847.48] It wasn't working.
[847.54 → 848.28] I was like, ah, crap.
[848.32 → 849.06] I grabbed the wrong one.
[849.14 → 852.84] So I also needed one of those, but I didn't want like the bulky first party doc.
[852.84 → 856.84] I wanted just like a little, a little sleek cable style doc.
[857.00 → 861.20] And so I, when I was, there just getting the cable or looking for the cable, I just didn't
[861.20 → 861.94] bother buying that.
[862.00 → 863.26] And I was like, okay, I'm just going to leave.
[863.38 → 865.82] And then I'll come back tomorrow with Yvonne, and we'll make a video.
[865.82 → 867.68] It was, it was actually really fun.
[867.94 → 873.24] Um, but it completely blew my cover because while I got in and out of there with like two
[873.24 → 878.46] selfies, uh, the first day when I was just like kind of scouting it out and determining
[878.46 → 881.80] that, oh yeah, no, this is like definitely a video I should just come back with Yvonne.
[882.28 → 890.14] Uh, the second time around, I think, I think the r slash Malaysia post has people replying
[890.14 → 894.28] to the top post with their own, with their own selfies.
[894.58 → 897.26] Uh, like it was, it was kind of, it was kind of hilarious.
[897.48 → 898.22] It was really fun.
[898.32 → 899.92] The vibe in there was perfect.
[899.92 → 906.62] If you ever find yourself in a KL, uh, definitely stop by whether you need to buy anything or not
[906.62 → 908.24] because it's an experience.
[908.24 → 909.68] Is this the one that you're talking about?
[910.28 → 915.40] Oh, so that's the one that I ultimately got the, the decent deal on my micro HDMI and my
[915.40 → 916.12] HDMI cable.
[916.30 → 917.88] I just love the not a thief.
[919.74 → 920.22] Okay.
[920.32 → 922.50] I have been given some context for this.
[922.74 → 924.72] Well, I'm assuming the security camera footage of a store.
[925.36 → 932.54] Apparently that's like a big thing in this mall is people publicly shaming shoplifters with
[932.54 → 934.72] the security camera footage in their stores.
[934.72 → 940.46] So, uh, that guy got a completely different selfie with me that I don't think he posted.
[941.10 → 946.38] Instead, he went for the CCTV footage of me buying a cable.
[946.38 → 949.48] And had to clarify that you weren't a thief.
[949.70 → 953.40] But he was the owner, owner of the manager of that store or something like that.
[953.54 → 956.00] And, uh, and, and he, he did talk to me.
[956.12 → 961.14] He didn't, he didn't talk to me about posting the selfie, but he did talk to me about taking it.
[961.14 → 963.30] Uh, and then he posted the CCTV footage.
[963.40 → 967.34] I'm glad he did say not a thief because you know, the kinds of assumptions people make
[967.34 → 969.98] about me these days, they may very well have gone there with it.
[970.08 → 970.86] I would have thought you stole.
[971.02 → 971.96] Oh, a hundred percent.
[972.06 → 972.64] A hundred percent.
[972.82 → 972.96] Yeah.
[973.10 → 979.10] I actually, I actually ended up double buying because I, because I actually, I bought the micro
[979.10 → 982.56] HDMI cable the first day because that was like the first thing I did when I walked in
[982.56 → 985.78] while I was still just buying a cable and not making a video.
[985.78 → 992.72] And then I was like, well, I don't know if anyone actually recognized me the first day
[992.72 → 995.50] because I like, I was, I was pretty much in and out of the mall.
[995.86 → 999.72] Um, so the second day I go back, and I'm just like, okay, this is the one part of it that
[999.72 → 1002.04] I have to do a quick, quick little reenact of.
[1002.62 → 1005.76] Uh, and I was like, oh, well, I'm not going to like to waste their time.
[1005.76 → 1010.42] Like go in, like ask them questions again about where things are and then like not buy
[1010.42 → 1010.92] their cable.
[1011.08 → 1013.48] So I'm, so I bought, so I bought the cable again.
[1013.48 → 1016.32] And anyway, the, the manager didn't talk to me until the end of the day when I'd already
[1016.32 → 1018.24] gone all the way to the top of the mall and then come back.
[1018.82 → 1022.50] And, uh, and he was like, he was trying to give me something and I, I, I don't really
[1022.50 → 1023.64] like taking stuff.
[1023.70 → 1027.50] I mean, you've, you've seen, you've seen my conversations with people about swag.
[1027.62 → 1034.40] I just, it's, it's not even just like, it's, it's not like an ethical thing.
[1034.40 → 1039.58] Like I think that somehow I will, I can be bought for, you know, $6 worth of chocolates
[1039.58 → 1040.10] or whatever.
[1040.10 → 1043.74] It's just that I actually just do not want more things.
[1043.74 → 1044.14] Yeah.
[1044.22 → 1050.98] Um, like I have this conversation with everyone from friends to family to industry, um, contacts
[1050.98 → 1055.10] where I'm just like, look, I'm at a stage in my life where if I want something, I can
[1055.10 → 1057.52] buy it pretty much regardless of what it is.
[1057.52 → 1063.22] So if I don't own it, I promise you 100% it is because I don't want it.
[1063.22 → 1063.44] Yeah.
[1063.82 → 1065.78] Um, is this the one you're talking about?
[1065.90 → 1066.80] Uh, no, no.
[1066.88 → 1067.04] Okay.
[1067.04 → 1068.96] No, that's just a completely different one.
[1069.10 → 1070.16] Is it a different store even?
[1070.28 → 1070.44] Yeah.
[1070.68 → 1072.92] I love the guy over my shoulder.
[1075.56 → 1078.02] I didn't even notice him when we were taking the picture.
[1078.18 → 1079.46] I didn't see that the first time.
[1079.58 → 1080.12] Oh, that's great.
[1080.16 → 1081.70] No, that's a completely different store.
[1081.82 → 1082.06] Okay.
[1082.20 → 1085.60] Um, I no longer remember what I was talking about.
[1085.82 → 1089.38] So that's going to have to be kind of your job today because I don't have RAM.
[1089.44 → 1090.32] Keep it on track.
[1090.32 → 1091.10] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1091.18 → 1091.86] That's fine.
[1091.94 → 1098.32] Just if you do interrupt, which is totally fine because, you know, you know, taste of
[1098.32 → 1098.92] own medicine.
[1099.46 → 1102.68] Um, just you're going to have to tell me what I was talking about before.
[1102.78 → 1104.98] Uh, so you had to buy the cable again.
[1105.32 → 1105.92] Oh, yeah, right.
[1105.92 → 1107.32] You went upstairs back downstairs.
[1107.38 → 1111.72] So he came up to me after, and I was like, hey, uh, so yeah, not only do I not want the
[1111.72 → 1117.74] thing you're offering me, but you can actually have this micro HDMI adapter and this HDMI cable
[1117.74 → 1119.14] back because I really don't need it.
[1119.30 → 1122.86] I only needed the one, and he's like, oh, no, no, I can give you a refund.
[1122.94 → 1124.44] I'm like, no, no, that's too, that's too much work.
[1124.50 → 1125.40] No, I'll just buy the cable.
[1125.56 → 1126.62] Just don't worry about it.
[1127.04 → 1130.56] Thank you for having a reasonable price and not trying to charge me a white guy tax.
[1130.82 → 1131.04] Yeah.
[1131.78 → 1133.48] Um, yeah.
[1133.54 → 1135.28] So that was, that was great.
[1135.44 → 1139.90] I don't actually remember what all I wanted to say about shopping at the tech mall and this
[1139.90 → 1141.32] is my only notes in the doc.
[1141.44 → 1147.00] So just in case you forget your own name.
[1147.00 → 1151.26] Yeah, I thought about going back to Sim Lim Square, but then I, because we were in Singapore
[1151.26 → 1153.82] again, but I didn't have a reason.
[1153.98 → 1159.80] Like, that's what I kind of like about these videos is other than the one, okay, half of
[1159.80 → 1162.18] them anyway, are me just needing something.
[1162.82 → 1168.86] Um, and then the other ones I have contrived some mission, like in Shenzhen, I wanted to,
[1168.98 → 1174.64] you know, build a PC, a gaming PC and see if I could get a better deal in the like tech
[1174.64 → 1175.60] hub of China.
[1175.60 → 1179.20] Um, so that was like, that was a legitimate objective, even if I didn't really need a
[1179.20 → 1179.40] computer.
[1179.44 → 1181.20] I don't even remember what we did with the computer.
[1181.90 → 1182.82] Did we give it away or something?
[1182.82 → 1183.16] In China?
[1183.28 → 1186.00] I think you gave it to his editor or something.
[1186.00 → 1186.68] Oh, yeah.
[1186.72 → 1187.14] That makes sense.
[1187.14 → 1187.54] Pretty sure.
[1187.92 → 1188.22] Okay.
[1188.38 → 1190.00] It's a long time ago, but I think that's what happened.
[1190.00 → 1195.90] And then in, in Taiwan, it was just inspired by like Jake's random picture of this like
[1195.90 → 1200.72] random nondescript shop that just for whatever reason had a ball and gaming PC.
[1200.92 → 1203.84] Turns out it's because they just like make ball and gaming PCs.
[1203.98 → 1204.72] So that's super cool.
[1205.16 → 1208.22] Um, but then the one in Singapore was just because I was staying with people who had awful
[1208.22 → 1209.86] Wi-Fi and I just wanted to fix it.
[1209.86 → 1215.60] And then the one at Plaza Brouillette was just because I forgot some stuff and I like needed
[1215.60 → 1216.04] a tech man.
[1216.24 → 1218.28] I wish we had places like that here.
[1218.36 → 1223.52] Like, is there anywhere that you could go in person where you could possibly hope to
[1223.52 → 1228.82] find a micro HDMI adapter that you can think of off the top of your head?
[1228.82 → 1236.78] It probably exists.
[1236.98 → 1238.08] Memory Express might have one.
[1238.10 → 1238.62] To be clear.
[1238.90 → 1239.20] Maybe.
[1239.48 → 1240.98] You better check the stock online before you go.
[1241.04 → 1241.54] Yeah, they might.
[1241.66 → 1243.26] I wouldn't feel confident about it.
[1243.26 → 1243.58] But, but.
[1243.58 → 1243.90] They might.
[1244.64 → 1245.12] And.
[1246.24 → 1247.48] Micro Centre's not up here, guys.
[1247.66 → 1249.32] And an off-brand switch adapter.
[1249.96 → 1250.48] Oh, yeah.
[1250.56 → 1250.68] So.
[1250.80 → 1251.44] No shot.
[1251.56 → 1252.10] So probably not.
[1252.10 → 1252.62] No shot.
[1252.88 → 1254.16] And a 50 series.
[1254.68 → 1255.00] Yeah.
[1255.34 → 1255.78] Okay.
[1255.78 → 1259.18] Now I just eliminated every, every retail.
[1259.52 → 1259.90] Staples?
[1260.06 → 1260.96] I don't think so.
[1261.22 → 1262.74] Oh, that'd be a real long shot.
[1263.00 → 1264.30] But yeah, like, that's the thing, man.
[1264.32 → 1265.90] It's so cool.
[1266.30 → 1268.18] It's like six stories, dude.
[1268.56 → 1271.52] It's like six floors of mostly just tech.
[1271.58 → 1277.22] The very bottom floor has like some jewellery and clothing, like boots and stuff.
[1277.40 → 1279.28] But also, also tech shops.
[1279.78 → 1283.62] And while there are definitely things about it that I think are a little weird, like they
[1283.62 → 1287.14] had more than one, like HP branded store.
[1287.50 → 1289.18] Like just a dedicated HP store.
[1289.36 → 1292.38] They had more than one, like DOG branded store.
[1292.44 → 1297.24] And I'm kind of sitting here going, you know, is tech really Starbucks?
[1297.90 → 1303.06] You know, we're just the more, like, you know about the Starbucks effect or whatever,
[1303.30 → 1303.56] right?
[1303.56 → 1309.66] Where if they put two Starbucks on like opposite corners at the same intersection, they don't
[1309.66 → 1310.50] cannibalize each other.
[1310.58 → 1312.58] They just like sell twice as many or whatever.
[1312.58 → 1313.18] Somehow, yeah.
[1313.64 → 1315.78] That cannot possibly work for laptops.
[1316.20 → 1319.76] Like a laptop is not a it's not an impulse purchase, right?
[1320.94 → 1322.26] Am I missing something here?
[1322.30 → 1326.10] Maybe it is because there are those guys like flapping laptops in your face as you go up
[1326.10 → 1326.80] the escalator.
[1326.90 → 1329.68] So maybe, maybe if you are just impulse buying laptops.
[1330.34 → 1331.10] Oh my God.
[1331.16 → 1331.54] I don't know.
[1331.90 → 1334.00] Chat wants a not a thief shirt.
[1334.94 → 1336.24] That's actually brilliant.
[1336.42 → 1338.50] We should definitely do a not a thief shirt.
[1338.58 → 1339.14] Pretty funny.
[1339.14 → 1339.58] Okay.
[1340.48 → 1343.24] Dan, do you mind forwarding that over to the CW team, please?
[1343.70 → 1344.06] Righto.
[1344.24 → 1347.52] Should it be like, should it be you in that security picture?
[1347.64 → 1348.72] I'm trying to bring it up again.
[1348.72 → 1357.00] Um, I'm sure, I'm sure you'll find it and that will be, it's not that amazing.
[1357.54 → 1362.88] I mean, if it's a big zoom in, I kind of look like a thief.
[1363.54 → 1365.48] Just, it's just that on a shirt.
[1365.48 → 1375.94] Not a thief shirt with a fake security tag still attached.
[1376.12 → 1376.94] That's kind of funny.
[1377.36 → 1378.18] Oh man.
[1378.54 → 1380.88] Um, oh man.
[1381.04 → 1381.18] Yeah.
[1381.18 → 1385.70] We could even just like print a little, like one of those like old school, like bar style
[1385.70 → 1386.94] ones or something like that.
[1386.94 → 1387.80] That'd be pretty funny.
[1387.96 → 1390.02] Why don't we move on to our next topic?
[1390.14 → 1394.54] Dan, you're going to have to be like on the little paper things today because I got, I
[1394.54 → 1395.86] have no idea what's going on.
[1395.94 → 1397.58] I don't even know why there's jerky on my table.
[1397.68 → 1398.44] You're allowed to eat it.
[1398.50 → 1399.18] You can eat the jerky.
[1399.22 → 1400.40] I'm allowed to eat the jerky.
[1400.54 → 1400.86] Absolutely.
[1401.62 → 1401.96] Okay.
[1402.22 → 1405.34] My stomach is actually feeling a little unsettled right now.
[1405.36 → 1407.46] So I might have to eat jerky a little bit later.
[1407.46 → 1410.42] My body has no idea what's going on.
[1410.64 → 1411.56] Three different countries.
[1411.78 → 1411.98] Yeah.
[1412.24 → 1413.38] I, I dude.
[1414.18 → 1416.54] With, with airplane food thrown in the mix.
[1416.96 → 1421.88] Uh, no, actually I didn't eat at all on the flight, and it's like 13 hours.
[1421.88 → 1427.04] Um, so I, then I got home and I ate pretty light because I was feeling a little unsettled.
[1427.04 → 1430.78] And I think it's because of what I ate right before I got on the flight.
[1430.90 → 1435.16] I had a subway sandwich, which normally I'm fine with.
[1435.60 → 1437.76] I, I, I like happy Gilmore.
[1438.70 → 1444.04] I, the trailer for happy Gilmore too, looks awful, like completely soulless.
[1444.04 → 1450.66] But, but you know, happy told me that the delicious cold cut con, honestly, better spokesman than Jared.
[1451.08 → 1453.58] Far, far less, far less pedophilia.
[1453.94 → 1457.42] So shout out happy Gilmore subway spokesman, happy Gilmore.
[1457.60 → 1459.86] I prefer my sandwiches with no pedophilia.
[1460.02 → 1460.32] Yes.
[1460.46 → 1460.70] Yeah.
[1460.80 → 1461.40] Me too.
[1461.66 → 1462.78] Generally a good way to go.
[1462.86 → 1464.70] I can ask for that in the store, you know?
[1464.80 → 1465.32] Oh, okay.
[1465.40 → 1465.56] Yeah.
[1465.62 → 1466.30] That's good to know.
[1466.38 → 1466.92] That's good.
[1467.04 → 1467.42] That's good.
[1467.42 → 1478.38] Um, the point is that, that I'm trying to make right now is that whether it was a language barrier or whether it was an ingredients' availability barrier, um, they made it with processed cheese.
[1478.38 → 1482.82] When I explicitly asked for cheddar and processed cheese is not food.
[1483.62 → 1487.20] Um, my body does not believe that it is food.
[1487.50 → 1497.06] And because I was so hungry, I ate a six inch, uh, like I ate half of that processed cheese sandwich and, uh, my body is in rebellion.
[1497.42 → 1497.78] No.
[1498.12 → 1498.60] That happens.
[1498.78 → 1503.52] My, yeah, my stomach is not impressed with me making that decision to continue eating it after the first bite.
[1503.78 → 1509.26] And so I am unsettled still like 18, 19 hours later or whatever.
[1509.62 → 1515.22] Uh, but I will definitely, I will definitely have some jerky later, and I'm really looking forward to it.
[1517.52 → 1519.38] Someone's apparently watching the show on a plane.
[1519.64 → 1519.88] That's.
[1520.86 → 1523.58] Dude, you can get pretty like decent streaming internet.
[1523.80 → 1524.94] That's so crazy to me.
[1525.06 → 1525.24] Yeah.
[1525.24 → 1527.68] I like, I, I believe them, but I, it's so crazy to me.
[1527.72 → 1531.94] I remember, um, I remember just as a test, I load up some game.
[1532.00 → 1532.84] I don't remember what it was.
[1533.36 → 1539.94] Um, and I, I had on, on some plane like years ago, I had 3000 pings and the game functioned
[1539.94 → 1544.04] perfectly fine, but just everything was like so delayed.
[1544.96 → 1546.52] I just wanted to see what would happen.
[1546.52 → 1548.92] Uh, no, I don't, I don't think so.
[1548.92 → 1554.08] Because like, um, it was like too much.
[1554.08 → 1558.04] I was just actually so bad that it is just nothing like it.
[1558.14 → 1558.84] I don't know.
[1559.50 → 1562.36] Oh, do people not know what, uh, processed cheeses?
[1563.48 → 1563.88] Dude.
[1564.06 → 1565.50] Did I talk about this on WAN show?
[1565.50 → 1570.42] Do you know the experience I had in like a, a separate, I've been travelling the last three
[1570.42 → 1572.12] weekend, four weekends in a row.
[1572.28 → 1575.82] I am like actually travelled out right now.
[1576.08 → 1576.86] Um, yeah.
[1576.86 → 1578.24] I'm a little travelled out right now too, which is rare.
[1578.40 → 1583.64] Went to Disneyland for the work thing, went to Texas for the, uh, gamer house tour thing.
[1583.64 → 1588.38] And then the last two weeks I was over in Asia and six different hotels for two weeks.
[1588.82 → 1593.98] Um, like I am super travelled out, but did, did I, did I talk about my experience at, at
[1593.98 → 1598.10] the airport on the WAN show where I was like trying to order a burger and I asked if the
[1598.10 → 1600.70] burger had processed cheese, and they're like, it's American cheese.
[1600.70 → 1603.12] And I'm like, that doesn't mean anything to me.
[1603.18 → 1607.68] American cheese is like, I've heard American cheese used to describe cheddar cheese.
[1607.86 → 1610.68] It's kind of like freedom fries, like just American cheese.
[1610.80 → 1612.82] Like, yeah, that, that, that's utterly meaningless to me.
[1612.82 → 1614.50] American cheese is actually a specific thing.
[1614.64 → 1617.32] Um, I think it, I think it means processed cheese.
[1617.36 → 1620.12] But I think sometimes people use it for too many things.
[1620.16 → 1620.36] Yeah.
[1620.50 → 1621.38] No, I've, I've definitely.
[1621.74 → 1622.50] Processed cheddar.
[1622.96 → 1623.20] Yeah.
[1623.32 → 1623.52] Okay.
[1623.72 → 1627.50] American cheese is a type of processed cheddar, uh, cheese made from cheddar Colby or similar
[1627.50 → 1629.56] cheeses in conjunction with other stuff.
[1629.56 → 1635.54] Also, you should not be allowed that the content of your cheese should have to be greater than
[1635.54 → 1638.30] 90% cheese for you to call it cheese.
[1638.68 → 1642.38] American cheese is just petroleum by-product as far as I can tell.
[1642.38 → 1644.24] I think they can't call it cheese.
[1644.36 → 1649.54] I think it has to be like processed, uh, milk product or something.
[1649.62 → 1654.34] American cheese has a whole very, actually very specific history behind it where they
[1654.34 → 1659.52] were like trying to save farmers and they, they stored them in these like cheese caves
[1659.52 → 1662.96] and it's all, it's all, it's weird.
[1663.12 → 1667.20] Anyway, the point that I'm trying to get to is that the, the lady behind the counter had
[1667.20 → 1669.02] no idea what I was talking about.
[1669.60 → 1673.44] I was like, is it like cheddar cheese or is it like processed cheese?
[1673.52 → 1674.44] Like, is it real cheese?
[1674.86 → 1676.14] She's like, it's American cheese.
[1676.26 → 1677.40] And I'm like, okay, right.
[1677.44 → 1679.54] But is it, is it real cheese?
[1679.54 → 1681.92] I'll have to check with the chef.
[1681.98 → 1683.40] And I'm like, you're at a burger joint.
[1684.06 → 1685.08] There isn't a chef.
[1686.02 → 1688.34] Like, it was a it was like a fast food chain.
[1688.48 → 1689.64] I was like, what are you talking about?
[1689.66 → 1692.94] And I just, I just want to know if you're putting real food in the food.
[1692.94 → 1698.32] Um, yeah, no, it's, it's, it's horrible.
[1700.30 → 1703.18] Apparently by law, it's labelled as cheese product.
[1704.08 → 1704.48] Yeah.
[1704.50 → 1707.14] Well, a lot of places definitely don't do that.
[1707.32 → 1708.98] They, they definitely call it cheese.
[1709.08 → 1712.78] I'm just saying by law, that's apparently the label that they have for it is, they don't
[1712.78 → 1713.44] just call it cheese.
[1713.46 → 1716.60] Because it doesn't contain enough cheese to be cheese.
[1717.08 → 1719.52] It has to have 51% cheese.
[1720.94 → 1721.34] Disgusting.
[1721.34 → 1723.18] All right, what do you want to do for our next topic?
[1724.26 → 1726.08] We have a lot of topics today.
[1726.20 → 1728.42] It's actually going to be like a very long show.
[1728.54 → 1729.76] Should we knock out the other main one?
[1730.00 → 1730.38] Mark Robert?
[1730.62 → 1734.28] I don't think anything really differentiates a main from another topic today.
[1734.88 → 1735.36] Yeah.
[1735.56 → 1736.90] So we can do whatever you want.
[1736.98 → 1738.64] In that case, let's do one of mine.
[1738.88 → 1741.22] The EU says Apple can make a portless iPhone.
[1741.42 → 1741.98] Let's go.
[1741.98 → 1747.08] Over the weekend, we learned that Apple considered removing the USB-C port from its upcoming iPhone
[1747.08 → 1750.10] Air 17, but ultimately decided against the move.
[1750.10 → 1752.32] In the past, due to concerns.
[1752.52 → 1753.02] In part.
[1753.02 → 1758.16] In part, due to concerns about, he might be tired, but he's still beating my dyslexia.
[1758.18 → 1759.62] My brain's slow, but accurate.
[1761.20 → 1761.72] Precise.
[1761.88 → 1767.60] Due to, due to concerns about how EU regulators would view the move.
[1767.90 → 1772.98] Apple was forced to switch out of their proprietary lightning port for USB-C to comply with the
[1772.98 → 1774.42] EU's common charger directive.
[1774.42 → 1775.50] They won't admit that.
[1775.68 → 1779.14] Apple talks about, it's amazing watching how quickly Apple.
[1779.14 → 1780.78] Isn't it like an environmentally friendly thing or something?
[1780.80 → 1786.04] How quickly Apple changed their tune about how they innovated USB-C on the iPhone.
[1786.18 → 1788.04] It's like, brother, enough.
[1788.28 → 1789.14] Just stop.
[1789.14 → 1796.22] In an article on 9to5Macs, Ben Lovejoy points out that the common charger directive only states
[1796.22 → 1799.94] that if a device has a wired charging port, it must be USB-C.
[1800.48 → 1807.80] European Commission press officer Federica McCauley confirmed that a portless phone would
[1807.80 → 1812.60] be compliant with the law, noting that since such radio equipment cannot be recharged via
[1812.60 → 1817.90] wired charging, it does not need to incorporate the harmonized wired charging solution.
[1819.20 → 1819.76] Crazy.
[1820.14 → 1820.40] Wow.
[1821.22 → 1827.70] So we will probably get a courageously portless iPhone at some point in the bearish future.
[1828.02 → 1828.64] And you know what?
[1828.72 → 1832.52] Honestly, I think I'm kind of here for it.
[1832.96 → 1833.96] It's not what I would.
[1833.96 → 1834.70] I feel like it's going to happen eventually.
[1834.70 → 1838.06] Yeah, it's not what I would choose to buy, you know, given the choice.
[1838.20 → 1842.48] I would prefer to have something that does have a wired port, but there's always the
[1842.48 → 1847.52] option of just, you know, buying the pro model or not buying an iPhone, both of which are
[1847.52 → 1848.72] totally valid options.
[1848.72 → 1856.20] Also, my response to this sort of hinges on the existence of sort of all three options
[1856.20 → 1856.82] in the market.
[1857.02 → 1862.70] So the Air, which doesn't seem like it's going to replace the regular iPhone.
[1862.70 → 1866.70] iPhone, the regular iPhone, and then also the pro.
[1866.70 → 1871.28] So I would assume you're going to have kind of your portless one, your USB to one with
[1871.28 → 1875.30] a port so you can actually charge via a cable, but data transfer is slow.
[1875.40 → 1879.70] And then your, you know, professional model that just has a proper USB port on it.
[1879.70 → 1885.96] I don't love how much Apple charges for these more, you know, premium versions of their
[1885.96 → 1892.76] products, but seeing the way that most people use their phones these days, especially iPhone
[1892.76 → 1894.72] users who are just like MagSafe.
[1895.04 → 1896.88] Like, why would anyone live without MagSafe?
[1896.94 → 1897.86] It's just so obvious.
[1898.26 → 1900.64] And they wirelessly charge all the time.
[1900.64 → 1904.92] I could absolutely see iPhone users just saying, yeah, no, I want, I want the Air.
[1905.54 → 1909.34] And man, I got to tell you, I think, I think I was talking about this on Manchu recently.
[1909.34 → 1913.64] I picked up my iPhone 6S recently, like just literally picked it up.
[1913.70 → 1915.98] Like I picked it up out of the drawer that I keep it in.
[1916.06 → 1918.08] And I was like, man, that's light.
[1918.64 → 1923.42] You know, even my Note 9 compared to like every modern device that I've unboxed on Short
[1923.42 → 1926.22] Circuit recently, it's like, man, this is sleek.
[1926.22 → 1929.52] Like devices have, they've gone non-sleek.
[1929.68 → 1929.76] Yeah.
[1930.02 → 1935.42] And if Apple kind of brings that back as a trend now that SOCS have gotten a little bit
[1935.42 → 1939.70] more efficient, now that battery technology has improved a little bit, maybe, maybe I'm
[1939.70 → 1940.20] here for it.
[1940.24 → 1942.46] I, because I don't need two day battery.
[1942.84 → 1946.40] I just need solid one day battery.
[1946.62 → 1953.06] With that said, man, I got to say, spoiler, the one spoiler that I'll give you guys for
[1953.06 → 1962.20] the switching to Mac for a month, um, is not thinking about charging either of my devices.
[1962.84 → 1963.76] It's crazy.
[1964.04 → 1969.88] Like, dude, I, um, I've been using this since I left Singapore.
[1971.22 → 1973.48] I don't know, a thousand hours ago or whatever.
[1973.48 → 1978.60] I used it extensively on the plane just to, to like listen to, um, listen to something in
[1978.60 → 1983.36] my headphones, uh, just, you know, drown out crying babies and stuff like that on the plane.
[1984.00 → 1985.04] Um, let's compare.
[1985.46 → 1991.80] I, I, I got down to like 2% before I had my, my post plane, you know, bath.
[1992.28 → 1997.84] And then I basically plugged it in while I was in my nap and while I was having a nap in
[1997.84 → 1998.22] my bed.
[1998.22 → 2002.82] I, it, it can barely form a coherent sentence.
[2002.82 → 2003.50] You got it.
[2003.50 → 2008.50] And then I plugged it into my car and my way here, I have 77%, and it's just like, so you've
[2008.50 → 2009.36] done all that.
[2009.72 → 2012.50] I have practically not used my phone today at all.
[2012.66 → 2014.30] No calls, no video.
[2014.50 → 2014.88] Yeah.
[2014.98 → 2023.04] And for probably like 15 minutes of intentional screen on usage time when I was just in text
[2023.04 → 2026.32] messaging apps, like teams or Slack or whatever else.
[2026.46 → 2026.64] Yeah.
[2026.64 → 2027.18] That's it.
[2027.84 → 2028.80] My phone's at 82.
[2029.30 → 2037.34] I very occasionally, I very, very occasionally will have this behave like an Android, uh,
[2037.34 → 2043.18] where it'll get like really hot or for some reason that I can't really identify and, and
[2043.18 → 2044.26] like behave strangely.
[2044.26 → 2047.56] Like I've had a lot of weird bugs on with iOS 18.
[2047.56 → 2049.54] I'm not pleased with the software.
[2049.96 → 2055.68] Um, but not nearly to the same degree that I have with Android.
[2055.68 → 2057.56] My brightness is at like 70%.
[2057.56 → 2057.86] Okay.
[2057.96 → 2059.04] It was like turn brightness down.
[2059.16 → 2060.00] So here we go.
[2060.10 → 2068.36] I have 17 hours and 31 minutes of screen on time because, uh, Plex, I don't think supports
[2068.36 → 2069.46] or I don't have it enabled.
[2069.56 → 2075.82] Maybe it does support it, but, uh, Plex doesn't support, um, screen off background play.
[2076.02 → 2082.30] So if I'm just like one of my sleep strategies is I listened to reruns of shows that I've watched
[2082.30 → 2082.86] a hundred times.
[2082.86 → 2084.46] So I don't, I don't need to see anything.
[2084.46 → 2086.78] Uh, I'm not actually looking at my screen.
[2086.78 → 2092.02] I'm just like listening to this content that is fine, but it's just repetitive.
[2092.02 → 2097.20] It's, it's boring, and it drowns out people talking much more effectively than, um, like
[2097.20 → 2098.06] white noise for me.
[2098.22 → 2103.18] And then the other thing is that music will keep me awake 100%.
[2103.18 → 2104.82] I cannot listen to music and sleep.
[2104.82 → 2108.30] So, so TV shows are my go-to for when I'm trying to sleep.
[2108.48 → 2109.16] So yeah.
[2109.16 → 2111.74] So you can see here, actually, I've got my, my battery thing.
[2111.86 → 2116.66] I have since, yeah, it has no idea what time is for me.
[2116.66 → 2128.06] Uh, so since about 6am, uh, of the previous day, I guess, 6pm of yesterday, I have 17 hours
[2128.06 → 2134.28] and 31 minutes of screen time, a bunch of Plex, a bunch of YouTube, a bunch of 18% of
[2134.28 → 2137.08] my activity is no cell coverage, whatever that means.
[2137.08 → 2141.50] Um, 11% is Safari, but like that's freaking.
[2141.76 → 2146.12] I think that's your, your cell radio searching for towers, which takes a lot of battery.
[2146.30 → 2146.80] Should I turn that off?
[2147.16 → 2149.04] Uh, so yeah, that should give you some idea.
[2149.04 → 2152.74] And then I only have like a couple of hours of it since I, since I zapped it.
[2152.74 → 2157.88] So like even me being like irresponsible with my phone and not, you know, properly turning
[2157.88 → 2163.50] off radios to conserve power, like I can get like 16 hours of screen time on it or whatever.
[2163.50 → 2165.88] I never use my phone that heavily.
[2165.88 → 2170.96] So I think I said in my switched to iPhone video, I basically didn't charge my phone sometimes
[2170.96 → 2175.86] for a week at a time because I would just plug it into my car when I'm, when I'm using
[2175.86 → 2176.14] CarPlay.
[2176.24 → 2180.52] You don't have to, it supports wireless CarPlay as does my car, but it's just a habit that
[2180.52 → 2180.98] I have.
[2181.10 → 2184.66] Um, and it, and it meant that I never had to think about charging my phone because I would
[2184.66 → 2184.86] just.
[2185.44 → 2187.92] Regardless of usage, if I don't charge my phone overnight, I'm screwed.
[2188.26 → 2188.60] Oh yeah.
[2188.66 → 2189.18] A hundred percent.
[2189.28 → 2189.56] Completely.
[2189.68 → 2190.12] A hundred percent.
[2190.30 → 2191.08] I just checked mine.
[2191.08 → 2193.68] Um, I had more screen time than I thought.
[2193.78 → 2195.98] I had 25 minutes in Slack.
[2196.10 → 2198.90] I had 10 minutes in Teams and I had two minutes in Authenticator.
[2199.10 → 2202.70] I think the reason why there's more screen time is I just put my phone down, but that
[2202.70 → 2205.50] also means that after a minute or whatever, it dimmed.
[2205.50 → 2205.74] Yeah.
[2206.18 → 2209.96] So I, I, because I guarantee you I wasn't actually using Slack for half an hour on my phone.
[2210.38 → 2212.72] Um, so, and that's all it was.
[2212.72 → 2215.04] And I've already almost lost 20% of my battery life.
[2215.04 → 2218.64] So like, and someone's like knowing Luke, his phone's probably from 2016.
[2218.88 → 2221.90] It's not brand new, but it's an eight pro.
[2222.02 → 2222.76] It's not that old.
[2222.88 → 2223.20] Yeah.
[2223.54 → 2224.16] Pixel, pixel.
[2224.30 → 2224.48] Yeah.
[2224.84 → 2225.10] Yeah.
[2225.90 → 2230.26] Um, and like, man, my laptop is sitting here, right?
[2231.40 → 2236.70] It, I started the show with like more, less than, I think less than half my battery.
[2236.70 → 2240.68] And it's just sitting here in case I need to use it and screens on, it's just chilling.
[2241.18 → 2243.26] I know it's going to last the entire show.
[2243.40 → 2249.46] Like if there's, if there's anything that I love about just these Apple devices, it's
[2249.46 → 2252.72] that the battery management is just plain superior.
[2253.78 → 2264.44] And yeah, windows and, uh, Android devices absolutely can benchmark similarly to Apple,
[2264.44 → 2269.76] but from my experience in the real world, once you've actually, once you're not in a
[2269.76 → 2273.22] controlled environment doing like a battery test, right?
[2273.60 → 2276.22] They just don't handle it as well.
[2276.54 → 2279.38] They just don't manage background tasks as well.
[2279.46 → 2280.48] They're not as aggressive.
[2280.80 → 2284.44] And so once you've got them, once you've got your device loaded up with apps, once you're
[2284.44 → 2289.64] actually kind of using it, once you have notifications coming in, they just don't handle it as consistently.
[2289.64 → 2293.76] Um, all right.
[2294.22 → 2296.14] Bring back replaceable battery says crappy TP.
[2296.42 → 2299.50] I mean, that's not even, that's not even the issue that I'm talking about here.
[2300.30 → 2301.12] Um, yeah.
[2301.20 → 2302.68] Arguing says, just checking Mr.
[2302.72 → 2305.86] Who's the boss did iPhone 16 versus S24 ultra test Samsung one.
[2306.00 → 2306.44] Yeah.
[2306.44 → 2308.50] There's a couple, a couple of things to consider there.
[2308.60 → 2312.20] One is that S24 ultra probably has an internal battery.
[2312.20 → 2314.22] That's like double the capacity of the iPhone.
[2314.34 → 2318.74] It's remarkable how efficient these things are, how little battery Apple has to put in these,
[2318.74 → 2322.66] how little RAM they have to put in them, what Apple will do in their software to minimize
[2322.66 → 2324.14] the bomb cost of the hardware.
[2324.64 → 2328.70] Um, and then the other thing is that he probably did that in a controlled environment where both
[2328.70 → 2332.84] phones were wiped fresh and then, and then tested because that's the like, and that's
[2332.84 → 2333.94] not even the wrong thing to do.
[2334.30 → 2338.90] That's the right thing to do when you are testing something is you, you eliminate variables.
[2338.90 → 2344.32] And so, because there's no way to just take two phones that have been, you know, used for
[2344.32 → 2350.36] two weeks and say with confidence that they're in the same equal state, that's how you do
[2350.36 → 2350.64] it.
[2353.36 → 2356.12] Um, argument says that's fair.
[2356.18 → 2358.70] Didn't consider the size of the battery, but you shouldn't.
[2358.70 → 2359.68] I'm to be clear.
[2359.78 → 2364.10] I'm not making an argument that the test is like somehow unfair because Apple had less
[2364.10 → 2364.38] battery.
[2364.38 → 2366.22] This is the device that Apple chose to ship.
[2366.30 → 2367.82] So the test is 100% fair.
[2368.26 → 2373.80] That's like, if I were saying that, that would be like one of those arguments where, uh, you
[2373.80 → 2379.12] know, people will complain when you do like a CPU review that like, well, you're comparing
[2379.12 → 2382.56] against the brand that I like last generation.
[2382.56 → 2385.92] So you have to wait until their new one comes out before you can shut up.
[2386.48 → 2387.34] No, I don't.
[2387.34 → 2392.60] Because for someone buying something today, some hypothetical future thing that exists
[2392.60 → 2393.80] doesn't exist yet.
[2394.00 → 2395.76] So this is, this is what it is.
[2396.12 → 2402.34] Um, but now man, I don't see that argument as much anymore, but back in like the peak,
[2402.46 → 2411.48] I think AMD Intel fanboy days of probably like the mid two thousands, it was all over the
[2411.48 → 2411.72] place.
[2411.72 → 2417.50] And it was just exhausting, just exhausting hearing people talk about how the test was
[2417.50 → 2419.36] unfair to their brand of choice.
[2419.36 → 2421.98] Like, good Lord, they're not a sports team.
[2422.10 → 2423.62] You do not need to cheer for them.
[2423.94 → 2425.30] They're a corporation for that matter.
[2425.38 → 2428.56] Sports teams are corporations, and you don't really need to cheer for them either, but that's
[2428.56 → 2428.84] a whole.
[2428.92 → 2432.48] And often used for like really shady money practices.
[2432.86 → 2433.10] What?
[2433.38 → 2434.68] Oh, I don't, I don't know.
[2434.80 → 2435.54] I don't know much about this.
[2435.54 → 2438.70] You used to like to make it so you don't have to pay taxes and all this other crazy stuff.
[2438.70 → 2441.48] Like why do all these rich people buy sports teams?
[2441.90 → 2442.86] I thought it was just ego.
[2442.86 → 2443.62] They actually all care about sports.
[2443.76 → 2447.82] And then, yeah, a lot of it has to do with like, um, hiding from taxes and stuff.
[2448.38 → 2452.52] I don't remember exactly how all the loopholes work, but there's like big financial loopholes
[2452.52 → 2453.46] with having a sports team.
[2453.48 → 2455.50] Why is everything a tax avoidance grift?
[2455.70 → 2456.02] Yeah.
[2457.16 → 2458.16] That's not an answer.
[2458.38 → 2458.68] Yeah.
[2459.58 → 2460.88] I pay my taxes.
[2461.12 → 2461.46] Yeah.
[2462.50 → 2465.20] Everyone should have to pay their taxes if I have to pay mine.
[2465.32 → 2465.64] Yeah.
[2465.90 → 2466.42] You'd think.
[2468.70 → 2471.08] Okay.
[2472.72 → 2473.56] It's very cool.
[2474.20 → 2474.52] What?
[2474.66 → 2475.02] Seriously?
[2475.14 → 2476.26] People are like, yeah, no.
[2476.92 → 2478.60] People are like, yeah, this is like a thing.
[2478.74 → 2479.54] Oh, it's totally a thing.
[2479.84 → 2480.04] Yeah.
[2481.20 → 2482.18] What the heck?
[2482.48 → 2482.74] Yep.
[2484.88 → 2490.28] Because something about like the depreciation, like, so the a lot of the assets actually get
[2490.28 → 2493.38] paid for effectively by the city because the city wants the sports team.
[2493.48 → 2494.32] Oh yeah, that I know.
[2494.32 → 2499.02] But then all the assets that you own technically, even though they're effectively funded by the
[2499.02 → 2501.36] city are depreciating all the time.
[2502.22 → 2506.76] So you can write the depreciation of this like enormous stadium and all these other things
[2506.76 → 2509.06] down on the rest of your taxes.
[2510.34 → 2513.34] Um, but then the stadium keeps getting funded by the city.
[2513.34 → 2517.68] So it ends up being this, like, as long as you're making money elsewhere, it's this like
[2517.68 → 2520.92] incredibly profitable because of tax loophole thing.
[2521.88 → 2523.14] I think that's how it works.
[2523.22 → 2523.70] It's been a while.
[2523.90 → 2529.38] No, I remember reading a fair bit about that when the, uh, when the Phoenix coyotes like
[2529.38 → 2537.42] couldn't get something, something, the city was mad because, um, because of that, because
[2537.42 → 2541.82] they basically like paid for this thing and got absolutely no return on it or whatever.
[2541.82 → 2543.68] And they were talking about moving the team or something.
[2543.68 → 2545.02] And it was a whole, it was a whole thing.
[2545.08 → 2552.02] So yeah, basically owners will just hold the team hostage unless cities acquiesce to their
[2552.02 → 2552.40] demands.
[2552.40 → 2556.12] And I remember it compounds too, because like the players are all aging.
[2556.12 → 2560.02] So I think you can like to write that down to a certain degree as well.
[2560.50 → 2565.82] I remember reading an article about how like not once in the history of these deals has
[2565.82 → 2572.12] a has a city ever actually been able to show a clear return on the investment that they've
[2572.12 → 2573.54] made into sports teams.
[2573.54 → 2575.66] With that said, I don't know.
[2575.66 → 2576.80] I do think there is a return.
[2577.14 → 2577.36] Yeah.
[2577.36 → 2577.58] Yeah.
[2577.58 → 2582.28] I don't, I don't know that you could easily measure that because there's a clear expectation
[2582.28 → 2587.78] that if you're like a proper North American city, you like to have a big arena, and you have
[2587.78 → 2590.46] a sports team, and you absolutely use that arena for other things.
[2590.46 → 2595.52] But then my understanding is that the owner of the arena, which tends to be that private
[2595.52 → 2599.88] company benefits from the other things that get used for like concerts or whatever else,
[2599.96 → 2605.66] but like, so man, see, that's the thing is it's hard to assign a value to like arts and
[2605.66 → 2611.78] culture, and you know, to having, having prominent artists come to, you know, your city.
[2612.72 → 2613.12] Yeah.
[2613.20 → 2613.56] Apparently.
[2613.68 → 2613.80] Yeah.
[2613.86 → 2617.38] The, the, the value of the players reduce, and you write that off on taxes as well.
[2617.44 → 2617.54] Yeah.
[2617.54 → 2618.02] I thought so.
[2618.02 → 2622.38] So it's like, it's the stadium and all of your assets and all of your players and like
[2622.38 → 2625.88] literally everything that you have just constantly depreciates in value.
[2625.94 → 2629.00] So you write that all off, and then it gets all funded by the city.
[2629.36 → 2632.62] So you're not even, of course you're paying for some of it, but you're not even paying for
[2632.62 → 2633.54] like a lot of it anyway.
[2633.54 → 2638.78] And then it's like it itself is not always, but sometimes a cash cow.
[2638.84 → 2640.40] So you just make money off it too.
[2640.40 → 2641.50] And then write it all off.
[2641.52 → 2642.98] And it's just, yeah.
[2643.52 → 2647.84] Meanwhile, it takes me like months to even just get a building permit to put in our badminton
[2647.84 → 2648.26] centre.
[2648.50 → 2648.68] Yeah.
[2648.76 → 2649.22] That's pretty sick.
[2649.24 → 2649.70] Oh yeah.
[2649.74 → 2655.28] I should probably provide a little bit more clarity on the conversation last week about
[2655.28 → 2656.30] fire egress.
[2656.52 → 2662.62] I had some people very mad at me because I apparently don't respect the importance of fire egress.
[2662.62 → 2666.92] Um, I did not give every possible detail of the situation.
[2667.38 → 2669.00] Um, let me just put it this way.
[2669.08 → 2675.82] I do understand not because I just understand, but because this has been a project, um, on
[2675.82 → 2678.88] my list of projects for over a year and a half.
[2678.88 → 2689.66] And as part of it being a project, I spoke to experts and consultants, um, and guys chill.
[2690.00 → 2695.74] The reason that I said that the whole thing doesn't make sense and like that the differences
[2695.74 → 2698.42] don't matter is because they don't make sense.
[2698.42 → 2703.96] And the differences don't matter that we have already established now, and we're moving
[2703.96 → 2704.44] forward.
[2705.18 → 2709.56] Like the thing that I was kind of going off about was something that had like been dealt
[2709.56 → 2711.30] with and I didn't make that clear last week.
[2711.36 → 2713.74] So there were some people who were extremely mad at me.
[2713.98 → 2714.08] Yeah.
[2714.08 → 2717.14] There's a comment that said like the fire code is written in blood.
[2717.14 → 2718.58] It's like, yeah, for sure.
[2718.70 → 2718.96] Yes.
[2719.32 → 2724.96] But that was part of the reason that I also brought up the, uh, the, the arbitrary changes
[2724.96 → 2729.32] to the fire code, like how we used to have to build two stairwells onto a mezzanine.
[2729.32 → 2732.14] And then they were just like, Oh, actually forget it.
[2732.82 → 2741.68] So like, yes, the fire code is, is logical and rational and makes sense, but also sometimes
[2741.68 → 2742.22] doesn't.
[2742.54 → 2744.34] And they decide it needs to change.
[2744.42 → 2745.78] Things should have changes over time.
[2745.78 → 2751.66] And sometimes those things that change, you know what, honestly are just because of costs
[2751.66 → 2754.06] or lobbying pressure or whatever else.
[2754.40 → 2755.70] So let's not, maybe they shouldn't have changed.
[2755.78 → 2756.60] So maybe they shouldn't have changed.
[2756.60 → 2760.78] Maybe you should actually have two stairwells down from an above ground space.
[2760.88 → 2765.58] Maybe you actually should, but maybe that was just like too expensive and impractical.
[2765.64 → 2766.96] So it's always a balancing act.
[2767.14 → 2772.68] And the point of the conversation last week is not changed by any of these little details.
[2772.84 → 2781.58] The point is that regulation can absolutely be a good thing, but applied poorly, it can absolutely
[2781.58 → 2784.02] just get in the way of getting anything done.
[2784.26 → 2785.22] That was the point.
[2785.22 → 2789.82] I was trying to show how I see both sides of that argument and have personally experienced
[2789.82 → 2791.42] both sides of that argument.
[2793.92 → 2796.08] Crystal in chat says this.
[2796.52 → 2797.70] Oh my fucking God.
[2797.78 → 2801.76] It's like people assume that you maybe don't have any resources around you.
[2802.90 → 2803.38] Yes.
[2804.50 → 2805.48] And you know what?
[2805.54 → 2806.06] And you know what?
[2806.12 → 2808.24] Sometimes I do make mistakes, right?
[2808.24 → 2810.62] Like obviously I do make mistakes sometimes.
[2811.14 → 2811.20] No.
[2811.60 → 2816.50] In this case, it turned out to not be my mistake, but that's not the assumption that generally
[2816.50 → 2817.08] gets made.
[2817.42 → 2822.74] And it feels like a really weird situation that I've kind of found myself in as someone
[2822.74 → 2824.06] who does issue corrections.
[2824.42 → 2827.16] And as someone who does talk about that I make mistakes.
[2827.32 → 2827.56] Never.
[2827.56 → 2832.48] That seems to be harmful to my reputation.
[2833.62 → 2843.22] But I'd like to issue a reminder that you should trust someone who issues corrections and someone
[2843.22 → 2849.78] who admits their mistakes more than someone who doesn't admit their mistakes and just doubles
[2849.78 → 2851.38] down and is a weasel.
[2851.38 → 2854.38] But we do.
[2854.54 → 2854.96] We care.
[2855.32 → 2859.42] Actually, speaking of mistakes, we had an error in one of our videos this week.
[2859.90 → 2865.46] Yesterday, we posted an LTT video about fixing the 5090's power connector.
[2866.18 → 2870.90] Near the end of the original upload, we showed an email from MSI where they claimed that only
[2870.90 → 2875.94] the FE cards, the Founders Edition cards, have the design to run all the pins to a single
[2875.94 → 2876.68] pad on the PCB.
[2876.94 → 2880.20] It turns out that this statement from MSI is false.
[2880.20 → 2884.54] In fact, the PCI spec calls for them all to be combined.
[2884.62 → 2888.76] So the only 5090 that we're aware of now that doesn't immediately combine power on the
[2888.76 → 2894.20] board is ASUS's DOG Astral card, the design of which was mentioned in an email from ASUS
[2894.20 → 2897.64] that was also shown in the video, but we could have verbally pointed this out as well.
[2897.78 → 2901.58] Per our policies, we removed the offending segment of the video and posted a correcting
[2901.58 → 2902.02] comment.
[2902.52 → 2906.86] Big thanks to Guildford, who pointed out that error in the most efficient possible manner
[2906.86 → 2912.20] in the interest of making sure that the community is well-informed by recording a video of himself,
[2913.20 → 2916.88] uploading it, waiting around for it to process, and then publishing it.
[2916.92 → 2922.14] That was definitely the most efficient way if the absolute number one priority was making
[2922.14 → 2926.20] sure that the community gets the information that they need in a timely manner.
[2926.20 → 2928.12] We're not perfect.
[2928.22 → 2929.08] We'll never be perfect.
[2929.08 → 2932.68] But what I can do is assure you guys that we are genuinely striving to make the best
[2932.68 → 2933.36] videos we can.
[2934.14 → 2937.52] And in this case, maybe we should have just skipped that.
[2937.70 → 2940.24] Maybe we should have just not bothered talking about that.
[2940.34 → 2941.08] I don't know.
[2941.18 → 2945.62] I don't know what the fine line you guys want us to balance is here because the point of
[2945.62 → 2946.88] the video clearly wasn't that.
[2946.88 → 2954.56] But I think we've felt really pressured to cover every base when really the point of the
[2954.56 → 2956.20] video was to just be Top Gear Tech.
[2956.34 → 2957.24] Tech, Tech, Top Gear.
[2957.34 → 2958.98] I mean, there was even, it was pointed out on Reddit.
[2959.24 → 2961.28] There was a caveat.
[2961.50 → 2962.48] Was it in that video?
[2962.90 → 2963.74] I'm not even sure.
[2963.84 → 2967.66] But there was a caveat that was in a video where it was like, Linus is not actually running
[2967.66 → 2971.00] this test just in case he did something wrong in the footage.
[2971.34 → 2971.82] It was...
[2971.82 → 2974.04] And everyone's like, oh, that's unnecessary.
[2974.04 → 2978.44] And then there's a bunch of people in the comments pointing out like, uh, actually it
[2978.44 → 2983.64] kind of is because people like would have pixel peeped what exactly you had done.
[2983.76 → 2984.02] I know.
[2984.12 → 2985.40] And if you had done it wrong, they would have ripped it apart.
[2985.66 → 2986.04] Yeah, I know.
[2986.46 → 2987.04] I don't know.
[2987.12 → 2991.76] I think, I think one minor thing that could have been done here, which like this is a
[2991.76 → 2993.54] nitpick, and you'll never catch all of these.
[2993.68 → 2994.76] So I don't know.
[2994.80 → 2995.42] It is what it is.
[2995.60 → 3002.76] But I think it was said as a statement supported by the emails when you could have maybe said
[3002.76 → 3004.36] just they claim.
[3005.22 → 3005.30] Yeah.
[3005.48 → 3010.36] Instead of this is a fact because we have these emails, you could just say they claim.
[3010.80 → 3010.94] Yep.
[3011.10 → 3012.60] That might help a little bit.
[3013.10 → 3014.42] Ultimately though, I agree.
[3014.58 → 3016.74] It's, it super wasn't the point of the video.
[3017.06 → 3021.66] And I, I don't want us to stop doing stuff like that because we're worried about these
[3021.66 → 3022.10] types of things.
[3022.10 → 3023.04] And I have to be honest with you.
[3023.04 → 3029.24] Like I, I am sort of, I'm sort of blown away that they screwed this up.
[3029.58 → 3029.94] Yeah.
[3029.94 → 3030.58] That's surprising.
[3030.82 → 3033.00] People pointed out like, oh, it's just a PR person.
[3033.10 → 3033.92] It's a PR person.
[3034.02 → 3038.20] In the email, it literally says that they talked to people about it.
[3038.20 → 3039.84] Like they, they, they went and got resources.
[3040.38 → 3045.26] Um, just because it's a PR person doesn't mean that they're like incapable of accessing
[3045.26 → 3049.14] information or accessing the people that have information that is often quite literally
[3049.14 → 3049.88] their job.
[3050.30 → 3057.78] Um, what's more surprising about it to me is just how, how, I guess it's one of those
[3057.78 → 3065.32] things where you, if I ask you what colour your shirt is, and I like, I, I didn't like
[3065.32 → 3070.18] look that close, and you say blue, and I'm just like, okay, uh, Luke emailed me.
[3070.44 → 3071.18] His shirt is blue.
[3072.62 → 3075.38] What would be the point of you lying to me about that?
[3075.38 → 3080.20] Because of in a way how easily verifiable it was.
[3080.30 → 3080.68] Yeah.
[3080.92 → 3085.84] And it was exactly why we didn't feel the need to verify, verify it because why would
[3085.84 → 3086.70] you lie about that?
[3086.84 → 3088.24] That it could be worded differently.
[3088.24 → 3090.44] Like my God, I don't know.
[3090.78 → 3095.30] At a certain point, like it's a video of, can we get another connector on the card?
[3095.30 → 3103.00] Like, and, and to be clear, I'm not, I'm not downplaying in any way the validity of
[3103.00 → 3103.60] the feedback.
[3103.72 → 3103.96] Totally.
[3103.96 → 3104.14] Yeah.
[3104.20 → 3106.00] It's, it's, it's valid.
[3106.14 → 3107.50] And I would like it to be fixed.
[3107.62 → 3109.42] I don't want there to be something wrong in one of our videos.
[3109.44 → 3110.40] And the video is fixed.
[3110.64 → 3110.84] Yeah.
[3111.10 → 3112.26] The video is fixed now.
[3112.60 → 3118.66] Um, as, as soon as we were made aware, uh, we, we took action according to our, according
[3118.66 → 3120.08] to our corrections policies, right?
[3120.42 → 3122.14] Like that's, that's what we do.
[3122.38 → 3122.58] Yeah.
[3122.58 → 3129.96] Um, but like it, I shouldn't have to check something like that.
[3129.96 → 3134.92] The fact that we do is great to know, you know, now we're kind of sitting here going,
[3134.92 → 3145.18] okay, well, if Nvidia tells us how many CUBA cores a GPU has, do we have to check every
[3145.18 → 3148.36] sample to make sure, you know?
[3148.76 → 3155.52] Um, and maybe the answer is yes, but like, people, people literally were mad at us for
[3155.52 → 3157.76] that, which like, um, really?
[3157.86 → 3158.98] Oh, I didn't even catch that.
[3159.08 → 3160.88] Some people were like not spotting.
[3161.06 → 3164.18] Just in case people aren't aware of what we're talking about.
[3164.26 → 3169.06] There was, I don't remember exactly what video it was, but we got official slides from Nvidia
[3169.06 → 3171.68] that had, cause Oh, what?
[3171.76 → 3177.16] Uh, companies make mistakes sometimes even when they're like massive, huge, enormous company.
[3177.28 → 3177.58] What?
[3177.68 → 3178.22] No way.
[3178.58 → 3179.42] Uh, yeah.
[3179.48 → 3180.90] Nvidia made a mistake.
[3181.02 → 3182.36] They put the wrong number on the slide.
[3182.58 → 3183.70] Oh, I wasn't even talking about that.
[3183.70 → 3186.62] I was talking about the scandal where some of the ROP's were missing.
[3186.94 → 3187.34] Oh yeah.
[3187.34 → 3192.34] On a, on an Nvidia says a little more major, like less than 5% of the cards or something
[3192.34 → 3192.78] like that.
[3192.82 → 3195.52] But yeah, some of them just shipped with not enough ROP's.
[3195.78 → 3196.10] Yeah.
[3196.32 → 3199.22] I'm talking about is there, there was, yeah, there was a slide from them that was slightly
[3199.22 → 3199.60] wrong.
[3200.60 → 3202.68] KG4WWN says, have you verified Luke's real name?
[3203.54 → 3205.86] Perhaps the hospital with the birth certificate was incorrect.
[3206.20 → 3206.52] That's true.
[3206.62 → 3208.96] Why is my first name English and my last name French?
[3209.04 → 3211.70] You need to start saying this is the person who claims to be Luke.
[3211.96 → 3212.24] Yeah.
[3212.68 → 3213.18] Good call.
[3213.18 → 3216.44] And so, yeah, I got, I have to be, I have to be honest with you guys.
[3216.44 → 3224.16] If they had made a claim that was potential, that seemed like it could potentially be false,
[3224.62 → 3226.08] like, like they could get away with it.
[3226.16 → 3226.44] There.
[3226.80 → 3233.30] That's, that's, that was the assumption I made was that what they were saying was clearly
[3233.30 → 3235.84] something that they weren't going to get away with if it was false.
[3235.84 → 3238.26] So why do I need to check this?
[3239.02 → 3244.64] Um, and the answer is apparently because I just like need to, but it was just, it was
[3244.64 → 3249.74] so far aside from the point of the content of the point of what we were trying to do.
[3249.78 → 3255.94] We were trying to raise awareness about this issue in a fun, entertaining way.
[3255.94 → 3259.68] That's what we do.
[3260.44 → 3261.62] Um, that's what we do.
[3261.62 → 3267.34] I think as well as, if not better than anyone in the tech space, that's what we do.
[3267.76 → 3273.62] We talk about what we think people need to know, and we try and make it as engaging as possible.
[3273.62 → 3273.90] Yeah.
[3273.92 → 3278.52] You know, like some people in the community understood that, um, and some people didn't.
[3278.86 → 3290.50] Um, and I think the I think some of this, like, I think it's redirected or misdirected
[3290.50 → 3295.18] anger around tech stuff right now, um, is just going to push people away and make the community
[3295.18 → 3295.56] smaller.
[3295.88 → 3297.82] Um, because it's not, it's not fun.
[3297.88 → 3298.36] It's not inviting.
[3298.36 → 3303.10] Um, yeah, I'm, uh, I don't know.
[3303.42 → 3305.10] I don't want to get into that again today.
[3305.22 → 3311.74] Definitely makes me sad, but yeah, I, I, I enjoyed that video.
[3311.74 → 3316.30] I legitimately had a ton of fun and, uh, I'm not going to concept.
[3316.50 → 3316.70] Yeah.
[3316.76 → 3317.64] I don't think we should.
[3317.82 → 3319.46] I was talking to someone about this earlier.
[3319.46 → 3322.46] I really strongly do not think that we should.
[3322.46 → 3328.64] Risk not doing those things.
[3328.64 → 3330.42] And I think risk is actually the right term.
[3330.98 → 3337.22] Um, I think we should still have fun and I think we should still, you know, not necessarily
[3337.22 → 3340.24] go to mile 10,000 with everything.
[3340.48 → 3344.10] Like if you just want to kind of dabble with something and screw around, I think that's
[3344.10 → 3344.40] fine.
[3344.40 → 3350.24] I don't think we should lose sight of, um, being able to do things kind of quickly, kind
[3350.24 → 3354.00] of lankily for fun because sometimes that's as much as you want to do.
[3354.16 → 3359.56] And that's as much depth as there is to it being fun and going further would make it not
[3359.56 → 3359.92] fun.
[3360.02 → 3360.14] Yeah.
[3360.42 → 3365.52] Um, and like, and to be clear, there's room for analytical content that isn't about the
[3365.52 → 3365.74] fun.
[3365.84 → 3368.56] I mean, PSU circuit is a perfect example of that.
[3369.02 → 3372.90] Um, yeah, totally right place, right time.
[3372.90 → 3374.04] Oh man.
[3374.04 → 3380.88] So many people, uh, seem to be very, very confused about why we use the AI voice.
[3381.56 → 3382.70] Um, really?
[3382.86 → 3383.22] Yeah.
[3383.48 → 3387.34] Because they're like, well, it would only take like three minutes for a person to read the
[3387.34 → 3389.14] script or four minutes or whatever.
[3389.54 → 3394.48] Um, so the reason that we use the AI voice is that it automates the editing.
[3395.16 → 3400.54] So yes, Emily spends a couple of hours, like two or three hours, uh, lining everything up,
[3400.54 → 3406.16] but with a human voice, with the UMS and AHS, where you're actually editing like a like
[3406.16 → 3411.64] a flawed human take, um, we can't automate the actual cutting of the footage.
[3411.82 → 3417.06] So if you guys pay very close attention to these videos, which I don't really expect anybody
[3417.06 → 3419.08] to do because they're just not really the point.
[3419.24 → 3419.34] Yeah.
[3419.34 → 3420.38] It's not really the point of it.
[3420.50 → 3425.18] Um, if you pay very close attention, the entire thing is emphasized.
[3425.18 → 3429.48] So the entire flow of the video is identical every time.
[3429.66 → 3435.20] And the actual timing of the clips is automated to the greatest degree that we can.
[3435.30 → 3441.64] So using an AI voice makes that automated editing process more efficient and in the future
[3441.64 → 3446.76] can make it more efficient as time goes on.
[3446.76 → 3453.90] Um, I would love, I would absolutely love for this channel to, you know, be a super valuable
[3453.90 → 3459.12] resource for people and for it to start getting some, some views and some affiliate revenue
[3459.12 → 3460.26] and whatever else.
[3460.32 → 3464.58] And I would love for us to pivot and make it a fully human hosted channel at some point
[3464.58 → 3468.80] in the future, more like short circuit, um, where you've got a host kind of reading
[3468.80 → 3471.56] out the test report, injecting a little bit of personality and flavour.
[3471.72 → 3476.24] You've got editors spending, you know, anywhere from six to 10 hours working on it.
[3476.24 → 3486.30] But, you know, I, the, the, the entitlement of people who are attacking me for not being
[3486.30 → 3489.86] willing to lose more money on this channel is.
[3495.26 → 3497.32] I, I don't see a lot of that personally.
[3497.48 → 3500.94] Oh dude, I believe you, but I don't, I don't see a lot of that.
[3500.94 → 3506.94] You know, this has all of this, and he does all these things, and he can't, you can't get
[3506.94 → 3509.90] a person to read the like guys.
[3510.28 → 3510.90] It's not the point.
[3511.26 → 3512.10] It's not the point.
[3512.36 → 3513.58] The point is that it's a data sheet.
[3513.72 → 3515.36] It's a data sheet in video form.
[3515.36 → 3519.90] and I'm sorry that it's not losing enough money for you.
[3520.44 → 3523.16] Every single one of those uploads is a loss
[3523.16 → 3526.36] and I don't have a clear path
[3526.36 → 3528.54] to it being anything other than a loss.
[3528.72 → 3529.64] Not the goal even.
[3529.80 → 3530.62] It's not the goal.
[3531.94 → 3535.26] So chill.
[3536.14 → 3536.96] It's all good.
[3537.36 → 3537.90] It's all good.
[3538.66 → 3540.28] You can check out if, you know,
[3540.30 → 3542.10] a power supply that you're considering buying
[3542.10 → 3542.76] has been tested.
[3542.90 → 3543.86] You can see our test report.
[3544.28 → 3545.06] It's all good.
[3545.36 → 3547.40] Or you could just go to ltdlabs.com.
[3550.90 → 3552.98] Yeah, which looks all cool now and stuff.
[3553.68 → 3556.02] Dude, the site is like actually kind of amazing now.
[3557.04 → 3561.10] I'm extremely excited for us to beef up the team.
[3561.20 → 3563.96] Oh, hey, any progress on those postings?
[3564.54 → 3566.50] Yeah, we had interviews this week.
[3566.60 → 3566.94] Oh, sick.
[3566.94 → 3568.24] We have interviews next week.
[3568.36 → 3568.72] Oh, sick.
[3568.72 → 3570.44] We have interviews the week after that.
[3570.46 → 3570.88] Oh, sick.
[3571.00 → 3572.82] Okay, so we've had applications then.
[3572.82 → 3577.06] Yeah, there's a potential change to the job description
[3577.06 → 3579.16] of the writer position that might be happening.
[3579.36 → 3579.80] Okay, cool.
[3579.82 → 3581.68] But all the other ones are full steam ahead.
[3581.90 → 3582.48] Okay, awesome.
[3582.48 → 3584.90] And just because there was a change to the job description
[3584.90 → 3587.12] of the writer one doesn't necessarily mean
[3587.12 → 3591.12] we're tossing all the applicants out.
[3591.12 → 3595.04] The problem is we're shifting it from a senior role to a junior role.
[3595.14 → 3596.38] That's not actually...
[3596.38 → 3598.88] It does reduce the budget, but it's not for budget reasons.
[3598.88 → 3601.34] It's for like team organization reasons.
[3601.34 → 3603.40] I think the plan behind it is actually really cool.
[3603.76 → 3605.42] I don't know if I should necessarily talk about that on the show.
[3605.78 → 3606.58] Does that make sense?
[3607.66 → 3608.40] Maybe, maybe not.
[3608.78 → 3609.40] Either way.
[3609.40 → 3612.10] My brain is not working today, so go ahead and do whatever you want.
[3612.26 → 3612.48] Sure.
[3612.64 → 3613.76] Yeah, but we're changed.
[3614.02 → 3618.50] We had a bunch of meetings, and we decided to change the scope of the role a little bit
[3618.50 → 3621.52] and change some of the responsibilities and all this kind of stuff.
[3621.76 → 3626.42] So there were some applicants that seemed to be more junior applicants
[3626.42 → 3628.38] that were applying through aspiration.
[3628.62 → 3629.84] So we might keep those resumes.
[3630.08 → 3632.90] We might repost the job description to collect more
[3632.90 → 3635.64] if we feel like we don't have a large enough pool from there.
[3635.64 → 3638.28] But yeah, that one is changing a little bit.
[3638.36 → 3639.76] The rest are staying the same.
[3641.02 → 3641.24] Yeah.
[3643.42 → 3643.86] Cool.
[3644.16 → 3644.62] Moving on.
[3644.66 → 3647.66] I think we have explained to do merch messages.
[3648.16 → 3649.66] Oh, this is weird.
[3649.82 → 3650.82] Have you ever seen this before?
[3651.06 → 3651.30] What?
[3653.66 → 3657.92] There's a dislike button, but it says disabled by owner.
[3660.08 → 3661.02] Is that a thing?
[3661.10 → 3663.92] I have genuinely no clue what that means.
[3663.96 → 3664.88] Because I could click it.
[3665.64 → 3666.84] I don't see that.
[3668.04 → 3669.22] Mine doesn't show that.
[3670.06 → 3670.46] What?
[3671.38 → 3672.60] What does that mean?
[3672.68 → 3673.08] I'm on it.
[3673.14 → 3673.54] You can look at mine.
[3673.62 → 3674.34] Yeah, this is mine.
[3675.50 → 3676.48] What if I click it?
[3676.76 → 3679.26] I've seen a couple comments
[3679.26 → 3685.06] from people accusing us of disabling the dislike button,
[3685.16 → 3686.44] but I've never seen...
[3686.44 → 3687.08] It's not disabled for me.
[3687.26 → 3689.82] I've never seen the interface thing that they're talking about.
[3689.90 → 3690.54] What is this?
[3690.56 → 3692.16] Oh, 603 said, is this an A-B test?
[3692.22 → 3693.38] It might be an A-B test.
[3693.38 → 3696.40] That might be actually a setting that we have.
[3697.12 → 3698.38] And no, I don't think...
[3698.38 → 3698.94] I've never even heard of that.
[3698.98 → 3699.70] I don't think I have...
[3699.70 → 3699.94] Oh!
[3700.44 → 3702.52] I do have return YouTube dislike.
[3702.66 → 3703.04] Hold on.
[3703.42 → 3705.32] So what if I remove it?
[3705.72 → 3706.98] I haven't used it in ages.
[3708.98 → 3709.64] The refresh.
[3709.88 → 3712.28] Oh, I wonder if it's just to do with that extension.
[3712.88 → 3713.42] Oh, yeah.
[3713.48 → 3713.92] There you go.
[3714.22 → 3714.42] Oh.
[3714.76 → 3715.18] Wait, what?
[3715.18 → 3717.78] And my dislike, even though it said disabled before,
[3717.86 → 3719.54] my dislike clearly is still...
[3719.54 → 3721.18] It was registered because it's still showing.
[3721.96 → 3723.20] What does that even mean?
[3724.80 → 3725.24] Huh.
[3727.00 → 3727.40] Interesting.
[3727.74 → 3729.18] Is it like...
[3730.18 → 3731.96] So it's user error.
[3733.10 → 3733.50] All right.
[3733.66 → 3733.92] Cool.
[3734.64 → 3735.70] Well, yeah.
[3735.82 → 3736.14] Sorry.
[3736.22 → 3739.58] We have so much to hide that we removed our dislike button.
[3739.80 → 3742.48] Feel free to put that in your pile of things to be mad at me about.
[3742.48 → 3746.72] But actually, it turns out that you're just using a random extension in your browser.
[3747.30 → 3748.10] Linus is for censorship.
[3748.34 → 3749.30] So good job.
[3749.46 → 3751.28] He's taking my ability to dislike away.
[3751.44 → 3751.66] Yep.
[3752.26 → 3752.78] I...
[3752.78 → 3755.32] What a mean guy.
[3755.52 → 3756.68] I'm basically awful.
[3756.82 → 3757.96] What a big mean guy.
[3758.84 → 3761.64] Go buy an MSI GPU with honey.
[3767.28 → 3769.08] Didn't honey get removed from the store?
[3769.18 → 3769.46] Oh!
[3769.66 → 3770.18] Chrome, I think.
[3770.18 → 3771.08] Oh, dude.
[3771.08 → 3772.86] We have an update on that this week, actually.
[3773.04 → 3773.26] Oh.
[3773.52 → 3774.44] Speaking of which...
[3774.44 → 3774.70] Uh-huh.
[3775.30 → 3775.52] Wait.
[3775.60 → 3776.30] Where's the...
[3776.30 → 3776.84] Where's the thing?
[3776.90 → 3777.68] Why is this not in here?
[3777.76 → 3779.52] I definitely want to talk about honey right now.
[3779.62 → 3780.30] That sounds awesome.
[3780.40 → 3780.66] Do you?
[3780.82 → 3782.08] I definitely saw it earlier.
[3782.18 → 3782.30] Yeah.
[3782.36 → 3782.70] Oh, yeah.
[3782.74 → 3783.04] There it is.
[3783.06 → 3783.44] I found it.
[3783.72 → 3785.90] It's definitely not actually about honey.
[3786.02 → 3786.40] Oh, okay.
[3786.44 → 3786.68] Sweet.
[3786.80 → 3786.96] Yeah.
[3787.68 → 3792.32] In the near future, if you are watching an old LTT video, you might have noticed that we
[3792.32 → 3798.06] have cut out our old sponsor spot and added in a YouTube ad in its place.
[3798.54 → 3803.88] We're talking to you about this because we have, like I said in my original response to
[3803.88 → 3806.26] MegaLeg.
[3806.26 → 3813.82] Um, you know, just kind of willy-nilly cutting our back catalogue is not something that, you
[3813.82 → 3815.52] know, we're going to be able to do immediately.
[3815.52 → 3823.76] We have sort of a bit of a heavier ship to steer given our back catalogue is something like 10,000
[3823.76 → 3824.88] videos at this point.
[3825.28 → 3830.78] Um, and that our policy up until now and our agreements with our partners up until now have
[3830.78 → 3832.84] not included any of that.
[3833.12 → 3837.12] Um, but I did say back then that it would be something that we would look at and something
[3837.12 → 3837.94] that we would explore.
[3838.08 → 3839.50] So we have done that.
[3839.62 → 3843.22] The wheels have been turning in the background, and we're ready to talk about it.
[3843.22 → 3848.40] So, uh, yeah, if you, if you have kind of a jarring experience watching our videos, it
[3848.40 → 3853.72] is because we are going to be cutting some old sponsor spots and adding YouTube ads in
[3853.72 → 3854.84] their place.
[3855.16 → 3859.38] Um, the reason for this is we want to do a better job of policing our back catalogue to make
[3859.38 → 3864.40] sure that people aren't wasting time watching ads for companies that we either no longer
[3864.40 → 3866.94] support, uh, for various reasons.
[3866.94 → 3872.26] This can come down to their, uh, policies, any actions that they've taken or refused to take
[3872.26 → 3877.68] for our users, um, or companies that are no longer relevant, like maybe no longer exist.
[3877.86 → 3880.98] So obviously at the top of that list is honey.
[3881.08 → 3888.10] We have cut out or removed over 120 honey sponsorship reads, and our team is working on getting the
[3888.10 → 3890.14] rest done by next week.
[3890.28 → 3898.64] There are probably going to be, there are probably going to be some, um, some casualties.
[3898.64 → 3904.30] Uh, I believe there are two videos that are being removed from the channel.
[3904.46 → 3905.06] Whole videos.
[3905.26 → 3905.50] Yeah.
[3906.24 → 3909.82] Uh, I'm trying to find the I'm trying to find the chat where Colton and James were talking
[3909.82 → 3910.24] about it.
[3910.48 → 3910.80] Yeah.
[3910.84 → 3916.62] So we did a shopping stream for Prime Day one year and then we also, oh, they're both
[3916.62 → 3918.92] actually Prime Day shopping streams.
[3918.92 → 3925.78] Um, and because honey was so deeply integrated into the video, just chop out a segment was
[3925.78 → 3927.96] like a banner across the bottom of the whole thing.
[3928.06 → 3931.42] Uh, what we've decided to do is simply enlist those videos.
[3932.80 → 3937.96] Also, I figured out a way to loop me in to the evil that's going on with the dislike button.
[3938.22 → 3941.50] Oh, uh, we have dislikes on float plane.
[3941.50 → 3948.06] Oh, so you were just trying to create more value for float plane feature differentiation.
[3948.36 → 3948.62] Yeah.
[3948.94 → 3949.34] Yeah.
[3949.50 → 3949.78] Yeah.
[3949.88 → 3951.30] Well, it's like, but you have to pay for it.
[3951.36 → 3952.10] It's about time.
[3952.10 → 3956.06] Anyone kind of lumped you in with all of my evilness because you've clearly been here and
[3956.06 → 3958.48] complicit for 14 years or whatever.
[3958.64 → 3959.20] Dodging bullets.
[3959.28 → 3959.90] Good gravy.
[3960.02 → 3960.60] Is it that long?
[3960.88 → 3961.06] Is it?
[3961.22 → 3963.20] It's probably about right.
[3963.34 → 3963.86] 14 years.
[3963.94 → 3964.08] Yeah.
[3964.62 → 3965.62] Holy fuck.
[3965.62 → 3972.60] I think we're, I think we're like very close to 15 too.
[3973.14 → 3973.54] Technically.
[3975.64 → 3976.04] Yeah.
[3976.04 → 3976.72] It's been a long time.
[3977.26 → 3977.92] It's been a long time.
[3978.24 → 3982.24] I was telling you recently, like it's literally not going to be very long until this will have
[3982.24 → 3983.10] been half my life.
[3983.72 → 3984.52] That's crazy.
[3985.58 → 3986.50] We're not there yet.
[3986.70 → 3988.28] A few years away, but we'll get there.
[3988.54 → 3994.32] Anyway, if you see any of our other videos with honey spots in them after next week, once
[3994.32 → 3998.34] the team has had a chance to go through, please email info at linusmediagroup.com so we can
[3998.34 → 3999.46] get those removed.
[3999.88 → 4005.16] I don't think we're ready to talk about what our policy is going to be for what gets removed
[4005.16 → 4006.04] or what doesn't.
[4006.42 → 4009.50] But what I can tell you is it's going to be a little fuzzy.
[4010.34 → 4016.02] No, the plan is not to scrub through the entire 10,000 view, 10,000 video history.
[4016.16 → 4020.36] I don't think that's necessarily practical, nor do I think that it necessarily makes sense.
[4020.36 → 4026.24] But if we have videos that are old, but are still reaching a certain threshold of current
[4026.24 → 4030.26] day viewership, then I think those are ones that we're going to want to look at.
[4030.30 → 4035.82] But if there are videos that are getting like three views a year from 11 years ago, I don't
[4035.82 → 4042.42] think we're going to go back, and we're going to cut out sponsor spots for 5-4 clothing or
[4042.42 → 4042.68] whatever.
[4043.08 → 4047.04] I don't think that actually makes a ton of sense and is good use of people's time.
[4047.04 → 4052.88] So we're going to have to try to find a good balance between making sure that we're managing
[4052.88 → 4060.50] our back catalogue, but also not just like wasting people's time with mind-numbing, morale destroying
[4060.50 → 4060.98] work.
[4061.52 → 4064.56] So we'll try and find a good balance for you guys there.
[4064.98 → 4065.08] Question.
[4065.16 → 4066.60] Are we just leaving everything up on Flow plane?
[4067.54 → 4070.10] Because I know there's no ad spots, but you're saying they're removing entire videos.
[4070.32 → 4071.64] So we're just leaving those videos on Flow plane.
[4071.68 → 4072.44] Flow plane people are asking.
[4073.26 → 4073.62] Yeah.
[4073.96 → 4074.80] It's probably fine.
[4074.80 → 4076.88] I would think it's fine to just leave it on Flow plane.
[4076.88 → 4077.14] Yeah.
[4077.86 → 4081.04] I'm sure someone will find a way to turn that into a scandal at some point, but.
[4081.18 → 4081.34] Ah!
[4082.86 → 4083.54] You're, hmm.
[4086.02 → 4087.12] Endorsing honey in private.
[4087.54 → 4087.88] Yeah.
[4088.10 → 4088.30] Yeah.
[4088.40 → 4088.68] Behind his.
[4088.68 → 4089.16] Hiding it.
[4089.20 → 4089.36] Yeah.
[4089.36 → 4090.38] Behind his gated community.
[4090.44 → 4090.98] Behind my paywall.
[4090.98 → 4091.98] You can't help yourself.
[4092.16 → 4092.28] Yeah.
[4092.28 → 4093.58] You just have to endorse honey.
[4093.66 → 4093.88] Yeah.
[4094.06 → 4097.38] And you do it through ways that the.
[4097.50 → 4098.66] You make people pay for it.
[4098.68 → 4100.56] The most vulnerable whale users.
[4100.80 → 4103.56] I'm exploiting their addiction to.
[4103.56 → 4105.52] The people who trust you the most, Linus.
[4105.60 → 4105.88] Yes.
[4106.88 → 4107.60] Wow.
[4107.96 → 4108.62] That's pretty good.
[4108.80 → 4109.04] Wow.
[4109.62 → 4109.84] Yeah.
[4110.00 → 4110.22] Yeah.
[4110.30 → 4110.60] Good job.
[4115.26 → 4115.70] Okay.
[4115.80 → 4117.52] What else have we got today?
[4117.56 → 4118.34] We've got some announcements.
[4118.74 → 4119.34] Oh, yeah.
[4119.80 → 4121.62] We're supposed to explain merch messages.
[4121.92 → 4125.20] Hey, merch messages are the way to interact with the show.
[4125.28 → 4127.34] We don't do the other things.
[4127.34 → 4128.94] Super chats.
[4129.04 → 4129.52] Quick bits.
[4129.74 → 4130.18] Thank you.
[4130.24 → 4130.74] Those things.
[4130.98 → 4131.96] Quick bits is a tech like that.
[4133.60 → 4134.00] Bits.
[4134.64 → 4135.56] Bits on Twitch.
[4135.56 → 4135.70] Okay.
[4135.70 → 4136.66] What's your excuse?
[4137.28 → 4138.00] Twitch bits.
[4138.68 → 4140.24] Right after I said it, I was like, uh-oh.
[4140.24 → 4142.68] I didn't even catch it.
[4142.68 → 4143.58] Quick bits.
[4147.20 → 4147.80] Cool.
[4148.20 → 4148.86] So, right.
[4148.96 → 4153.20] Because if you're going to throw money at your screen, we believe that you should get something
[4153.20 → 4154.10] in return.
[4154.10 → 4159.16] So, how about a great LTT reversible bomber jacket?
[4159.30 → 4160.78] It's back, folks.
[4161.00 → 4166.34] It's the jacket made for the indecisive or the stylish or both.
[4166.80 → 4169.44] We saw a ton of you guys were looking for these.
[4169.74 → 4171.54] So, we brought them back.
[4171.64 → 4173.52] Luke and I are wearing the same jacket.
[4173.62 → 4176.58] I believe this is the only reversible garment that we've ever done.
[4176.98 → 4180.38] And this is a hilarious one for me because I never got one.
[4180.88 → 4181.22] Oh, really?
[4181.30 → 4181.44] Yeah.
[4181.48 → 4183.72] I, like, forgot and got lazy.
[4184.00 → 4187.40] Like, that's the thing about being allowed to have anything you want from the store is
[4187.40 → 4190.24] that sometimes you kind of go, oh, I'll get it later.
[4191.02 → 4192.62] And then you don't get it.
[4192.88 → 4194.68] And then you're like, oh, fuck.
[4194.96 → 4195.12] Yeah.
[4195.12 → 4197.58] Because the run rate wasn't high enough to do a reorder.
[4197.74 → 4198.90] And it's like, okay, well, I missed it.
[4199.06 → 4200.84] I never, I didn't get any of our Merino underwear.
[4201.30 → 4203.12] I have two samples of it.
[4203.20 → 4206.52] Like, pre-release samples that don't fit right because they were pre-release.
[4206.84 → 4209.60] And then I never got any of the actual production ones.
[4209.68 → 4211.34] You want to know something really tragic?
[4212.26 → 4215.44] I have none of the full-point exclusive ones.
[4215.72 → 4215.98] What?
[4216.32 → 4220.38] Because they all went so fast that I couldn't do the internal request form.
[4221.08 → 4223.10] And I just asked for them directly.
[4223.10 → 4225.20] And it just, like, didn't happen.
[4225.34 → 4225.90] That's hilarious.
[4226.16 → 4228.20] So in the future, I just have to buy them, which is fine.
[4229.56 → 4230.54] That's pretty funny.
[4230.60 → 4233.82] But the thing that really pains me is that I can't get them.
[4234.18 → 4235.08] I was like, I will buy it.
[4235.08 → 4235.56] It's no problem.
[4235.62 → 4236.66] But they don't, they're gone.
[4236.88 → 4240.60] There's no way that we're going to ask Marco to do, like, one shirt for you.
[4240.70 → 4240.90] Yeah.
[4241.08 → 4241.32] Exactly.
[4241.32 → 4241.94] It doesn't make sense.
[4242.00 → 4242.16] Yeah.
[4242.16 → 4244.36] He probably even still has the screens for it.
[4244.40 → 4248.00] But we're not going to, I'm not going to be like, because he could do it.
[4249.06 → 4251.96] But I, there's no way I would ask him to do that.
[4251.96 → 4256.38] The hilarious part is I'm not even the only person from Flow plane that is like, oh, I didn't get it.
[4256.38 → 4260.18] Christmas party.
[4260.66 → 4262.84] We could do a surprise run of all of them.
[4263.86 → 4264.20] No.
[4264.68 → 4272.68] If we ever acquire our own t-shirt printing gear and stuff, then I think we could do stuff that makes absolutely no sense like that.
[4272.78 → 4279.78] But as it is, when we have an external partner, like, I think we try not to f*** them any more than we absolutely have to.
[4279.78 → 4282.26] It's like a whole thing to load up the screen and stuff, isn't it?
[4282.40 → 4282.44] Like.
[4282.80 → 4284.18] Well, yes and no.
[4284.32 → 4285.98] Like, like, they do prototypes.
[4286.40 → 4288.18] Like, they'll do one shirt for us.
[4288.18 → 4289.34] That's aspirational.
[4290.48 → 4290.88] Yeah.
[4291.10 → 4294.06] It's not knowing this is the only one you're going to do.
[4294.08 → 4294.28] Yes.
[4294.34 → 4294.54] Yeah.
[4294.86 → 4295.26] Yes.
[4295.44 → 4296.28] And you know what?
[4296.34 → 4298.90] Honestly, our t-shirt printing guy is awesome.
[4298.90 → 4305.32] And, you know, sometimes he will even do stuff where he'll be like, yeah, I like what you guys did.
[4305.34 → 4309.16] But also, here's a version that has a couple more colours that I thought would look really cool.
[4309.16 → 4311.26] And like, so he'll do stuff like that.
[4311.28 → 4312.84] Like, he's clearly willing to put in the work.
[4313.00 → 4318.00] But I just, I don't like asking people to do something that makes no sense for their business in general.
[4318.24 → 4318.64] No, for sure.
[4319.36 → 4320.00] Yeah, I'm not.
[4320.10 → 4320.68] Sorry, sorry.
[4320.68 → 4321.36] Yes, I'm fixing.
[4321.46 → 4322.28] I'm fixing the collar.
[4322.60 → 4324.34] Anyway, the point is that.
[4325.20 → 4325.80] There we go.
[4326.02 → 4328.14] Luke and I are wearing the same jacket right now.
[4328.14 → 4329.14] Oh, did I not fix it?
[4329.14 → 4330.14] No, it's the front now.
[4331.12 → 4331.68] Oh, shit.
[4332.12 → 4332.44] There you go.
[4332.50 → 4332.78] There you go.
[4332.86 → 4333.42] Sorry about that.
[4333.70 → 4336.30] Luke and I are wearing the same reversible bomber jacket.
[4336.30 → 4339.90] It has the most subtle LTT branding of all time.
[4341.04 → 4348.14] Yes, we have a black on black logo that you can kind of make out if you look at it from the side.
[4348.36 → 4350.02] And then the puffs.
[4352.00 → 4355.24] The puffs make little LTTs.
[4355.38 → 4357.36] I thought that was really cute when I first saw that.
[4357.68 → 4358.24] See this?
[4358.44 → 4358.94] There's a T.
[4359.58 → 4361.84] And there's a there's another T.
[4362.26 → 4363.28] There's an L in there.
[4363.28 → 4365.52] It's far easier to just see the T's.
[4365.60 → 4366.48] There's an L in there somewhere.
[4366.90 → 4367.06] Yeah.
[4367.58 → 4368.80] Yeah, they're in there somewhere.
[4369.02 → 4371.32] I think the L's are made with the little square.
[4371.70 → 4373.86] So the bottom of the L is actually closed off.
[4373.92 → 4375.40] So it's not as easy to see, but it is there.
[4376.38 → 4379.22] Yeah, so by default, it's stealthy and sleek.
[4379.66 → 4384.22] And by not default, it is vibrant orange with LTT quilted all over it.
[4384.36 → 4389.24] It's weather resistant and slightly insulated to keep you warm, but not too warm during the spring.
[4389.24 → 4392.46] And also has a total of nine zippered pockets on both sides.
[4392.46 → 4393.84] So you can carry all the things.
[4394.08 → 4397.54] It's available now at leg.GG slash bomber.
[4398.40 → 4400.66] Also, we have some float plane announcements.
[4401.04 → 4402.16] After the first merge message.
[4402.16 → 4402.92] Sorry, before you go.
[4403.14 → 4404.92] I just want to show this because not everyone notices it.
[4405.02 → 4409.32] But someone asked me for like the sizing of it for tall people.
[4409.76 → 4414.30] I would recommend that it's just, it's small, but you can click on the size guide.
[4414.36 → 4418.02] And they have like actually pretty good size guides for like practically everything.
[4418.02 → 4422.32] So yeah, open that little, that little modal up and check it out.
[4422.32 → 4424.64] Oh, I didn't realize how well reviewed this product was.
[4424.82 → 4426.94] Oh, it's literally five stars.
[4427.26 → 4429.22] Yeah, it is an excellent jacket.
[4429.40 → 4433.84] Our, our goal, I believe is like four and a half or something.
[4434.58 → 4436.50] 4.88 out of five.
[4437.16 → 4437.72] Huh?
[4438.54 → 4439.50] That's pretty good.
[4439.74 → 4444.82] Man, for, for a company that has struggled so much to sell our jackets.
[4445.46 → 4447.72] We sure make good jackets.
[4447.72 → 4452.02] I, like it actually genuinely, I bring every opportunity I have, I bring this jacket up
[4452.02 → 4454.16] and I think we're never making it again or something.
[4454.34 → 4457.56] But the, the, the, no, the 3D down.
[4457.58 → 4458.20] Oh, the 3D down.
[4458.26 → 4459.40] We're never making the 3D down again.
[4459.42 → 4461.16] It looks incredibly sharp.
[4461.30 → 4461.66] I know.
[4461.76 → 4463.32] Like it's a really attractive jacket.
[4463.32 → 4465.64] It's probably like the nicest clothing item I own.
[4465.64 → 4468.32] It's super, super comfortable.
[4468.60 → 4472.38] Everyone that I've like handed it to is like, oh wow, this is really nice.
[4472.56 → 4473.20] And I'm like, yeah.
[4473.42 → 4478.28] But we just, it was like too expensive for people to not be able to try it on.
[4478.42 → 4479.62] I think that's a big part of it.
[4479.66 → 4484.94] I also think that we could have marketed the material that we were using, the like 3D printed,
[4484.94 → 4487.72] like feather based material that was super thin.
[4487.72 → 4489.08] And I think we could have marketed it better.
[4489.26 → 4490.76] Like we're, it's tough.
[4490.94 → 4492.02] We're still, we're still learning.
[4492.02 → 4497.52] Like we're, we're still pretty new at the whole like physical goods business.
[4497.52 → 4502.74] And we've been hyper focused on just like making perfect products.
[4502.74 → 4507.54] And for years, we just kind of relied on the sheer volume of traffic that we could drive
[4507.54 → 4510.36] to the site from our channel to, to sell it.
[4510.84 → 4514.24] Um, we need to get way better at marketing and we are getting better.
[4514.24 → 4517.34] Like just our product photography is so much better now.
[4517.34 → 4517.50] Yeah.
[4517.50 → 4518.36] That's huge.
[4518.56 → 4518.72] Yeah.
[4519.28 → 4520.18] Already in the team.
[4520.26 → 4520.92] I like our photos.
[4521.16 → 4524.26] A great job of like our copy is so much better now.
[4524.30 → 4525.38] Like website copy.
[4525.56 → 4529.32] Like we're, we are improving, but these things take time.
[4529.48 → 4530.56] Like look at this banner.
[4531.86 → 4532.30] Yeah.
[4532.44 → 4533.74] Like it's actually really cool.
[4533.84 → 4535.14] And like this one was sick.
[4536.74 → 4537.96] Like we just, I don't know.
[4538.08 → 4541.28] There's, there are things that are really coming along that like, it makes it feel like a
[4541.88 → 4543.24] it makes it feel like a real store.
[4543.24 → 4544.38] The site needs improvement.
[4544.82 → 4545.90] We know that though.
[4546.12 → 4546.62] We know that.
[4546.74 → 4548.24] There's a redesign that's being worked on.
[4548.34 → 4552.92] I don't know this, but I'm going to make a little assumption that the work being done
[4552.92 → 4557.14] on the redesign is being somewhat impacted by tariff stuff going on.
[4557.18 → 4559.16] Because it's probably not as big of a focus anymore.
[4559.30 → 4559.42] Oh dude.
[4559.48 → 4561.50] The team's been like, oh yeah.
[4561.78 → 4565.72] I mean, look, I mean, we're not the only ones, so I'm not going to sit here and complain
[4565.72 → 4571.76] like it's a unique situation that's impacting us, but the team's just been like working
[4571.76 → 4575.36] on things and then effectively has to drop everything.
[4575.40 → 4576.32] All gets tossed out the window.
[4576.52 → 4580.28] And go figure out just completely unnecessary bullshit that.
[4581.30 → 4581.56] Yeah.
[4581.98 → 4582.38] Yeah.
[4582.38 → 4585.92] It's like all the companies above the border and some companies below the border too.
[4585.98 → 4589.56] It's a lot of people, but yeah, I think, I think if I can make an assumption, they've
[4589.56 → 4593.46] probably shifted their focus a little bit to that more than the redesign, which totally
[4593.46 → 4593.94] makes sense.
[4594.10 → 4595.76] So the redesign is, is coming.
[4596.08 → 4598.20] I don't know when it's going to happen, but it's coming.
[4598.30 → 4599.58] And then hopefully it'll look a little bit nicer.
[4599.78 → 4603.60] The main thing that we ran into, in my opinion, is we just have too much stuff now.
[4603.68 → 4607.52] Like the, the design for the store that we had was fine when you have like a few shirts,
[4607.60 → 4608.44] maybe one or two other things.
[4608.44 → 4609.24] When it's a merch store.
[4609.42 → 4609.64] Yeah.
[4609.86 → 4613.84] And now we're like even more not a merch store.
[4614.32 → 4614.62] I know.
[4614.62 → 4618.82] Like we were only really a merch store back in like, I'm guessing like 2017.
[4618.82 → 4619.02] 2017.
[4619.38 → 4626.18] We've talked in the past about like separating the store for like, you know, tools and clothing
[4626.18 → 4627.02] and whatever.
[4627.02 → 4629.22] But it's like, how do we do that?
[4629.30 → 4630.78] We have like two tools.
[4631.44 → 4631.62] Yeah.
[4631.72 → 4632.04] You know?
[4632.52 → 4637.04] Like we talked about when, because the cables are coming up soon, and we've talked about,
[4637.14 → 4639.14] okay, well maybe we should like to launch a cable brand.
[4639.34 → 4642.24] And it's like, right, but we're going to start with just USB cables.
[4642.84 → 4643.04] Like it.
[4643.24 → 4643.44] Yeah.
[4643.44 → 4647.48] And, and then we lose the strength of the LTT brand.
[4648.28 → 4652.34] I think you could do it once you have like really a proper like line of products.
[4652.76 → 4653.66] Yeah, I guess.
[4653.76 → 4659.10] But the problem is it takes us so long to develop a whole lineup of products because, and, and
[4659.10 → 4664.04] a big part of it is that we refuse to make a product that just doesn't have a reason to
[4664.04 → 4664.44] exist.
[4664.44 → 4672.12] Like we've gone, dude, we, we have prototyped so many tools, whether it's, you know, tweezers
[4672.12 → 4676.54] or like, like, like disassembly tools or.
[4676.88 → 4679.96] Taryn was showing me a bag the other day that I'll never see the light of day.
[4680.98 → 4686.20] Like we, we prototype so much stuff, and then we just ask ourselves, you know, what is the
[4686.20 → 4686.82] point of this?
[4686.90 → 4688.80] You know, where, what is its place in the market?
[4688.98 → 4690.60] What, what need does it serve?
[4690.60 → 4694.62] And like, I've, I've seen a lot of criticism of our products, right?
[4694.82 → 4699.46] Cause people are like, why would I buy that screwdriver when I can get one from Harbour
[4699.46 → 4700.14] Freight for $4?
[4700.46 → 4702.30] And it's like, yeah, sure.
[4703.32 → 4703.72] Exactly.
[4703.90 → 4709.16] Whenever I can't find my LTT screwdriver at home and I need a screwdriver and I do find
[4709.16 → 4713.48] another one, I get like actually upset, and we'll keep looking for like a while before
[4713.48 → 4714.12] I'll give up.
[4714.56 → 4716.24] Like, why isn't it where it's supposed to be?
[4716.46 → 4717.94] I don't want to use this other one.
[4718.36 → 4718.76] Anyway.
[4718.76 → 4722.70] And if you want a Harbour Freight screwdriver, you can buy one.
[4722.76 → 4722.86] Yeah.
[4722.90 → 4723.16] Send it.
[4723.38 → 4728.18] But the thing is that we don't have a competitive edge against a Harbour Freight screwdriver.
[4728.40 → 4728.98] And we're not trying.
[4729.08 → 4737.48] Which is being, which is being designed, manufactured and, and sold and brought to market in a by
[4737.48 → 4745.68] via a completely different process with a, with a low cost at any cost mentality that
[4745.68 → 4747.20] we're not going to be able to compete.
[4747.20 → 4748.68] I don't own a screwdriver factory.
[4749.40 → 4749.64] Right?
[4749.74 → 4752.64] So we're, we're not going to be able to compete in that space.
[4752.64 → 4754.20] We have to differentiate in another way.
[4754.28 → 4758.82] We differentiate through our customer service, which has been a little slow lately, but is
[4758.82 → 4761.34] still committed to making sure that we, yes.
[4761.58 → 4762.30] It'll be fast.
[4762.30 → 4765.28] The quality of our customer resolution strategy.
[4765.96 → 4766.36] Solid.
[4766.56 → 4767.36] Let's go with that.
[4767.78 → 4769.70] Through the, through the trust me bro guarantee.
[4770.18 → 4779.40] We, we compete based on making sure that we differentiate like our precision screwdriver
[4779.40 → 4779.84] set.
[4779.84 → 4785.54] Um, you know, there was that side remark from someone, uh, that we cloned their precision
[4785.54 → 4786.34] screwdriver kit.
[4786.40 → 4787.34] We absolutely didn't.
[4787.48 → 4791.68] Ours disassembles and stacks and has a magnetic parts tray built into it.
[4791.68 → 4793.02] There's also wasn't the first one.
[4793.08 → 4797.18] Has longer shanks on the bit so that you can reach into recessed spots more easily.
[4797.32 → 4798.38] It has a stronger magnet.
[4798.38 → 4800.78] It also has a higher quality bearing.
[4800.92 → 4804.06] It has in handle a bit storage in a metal, uh, chassis.
[4804.18 → 4806.72] It's got all kinds of differences compared to other things.
[4806.78 → 4807.76] And yeah, it's more expensive.
[4808.06 → 4812.46] It's more expensive because it just costs way more to make, but that's what differentiates
[4812.46 → 4812.60] it.
[4812.68 → 4818.36] So we've had so many things in the prototype phase that we've just ultimately not moved
[4818.36 → 4823.04] forward with because, and, and maybe this is something that will change.
[4823.28 → 4826.84] Maybe this is something that will change where we actually do just say, okay, look, we
[4826.84 → 4831.42] need a pair of flesh cutters and yeah, they are not going to be.
[4831.62 → 4835.94] I think this is a, I, I, I think the original goal of that whole thing was very noble.
[4836.44 → 4842.96] I think eventually it makes sense to change once you have product categories started where
[4842.96 → 4851.46] someone might want all the stuff in this category to be from one brand or to, to have
[4851.46 → 4854.18] a, a style identity, right?
[4854.28 → 4854.44] Yep.
[4854.44 → 4858.00] Colour matching general aesthetic, similar to each other.
[4858.20 → 4860.46] That quality that is dependable.
[4860.72 → 4860.98] Yeah.
[4861.40 → 4862.28] Consistent enough.
[4862.28 → 4864.40] Like, yeah, that, that's totally a thing.
[4864.80 → 4866.52] Um, someone just said Milwaukee tools.
[4866.62 → 4866.76] Yeah.
[4866.78 → 4871.26] I mean, a lot of tools people like having, I mean, in a lot of those categories, it's
[4871.26 → 4874.80] because of battery compatibility and whatnot, but a lot of people like having kind of like
[4874.80 → 4876.18] one brand of stuff that they have.
[4876.18 → 4881.44] Um, so I think getting into a category, you should probably only do it if there's something
[4881.44 → 4883.52] new and good that you can bring to that market.
[4884.14 → 4888.10] Um, but once you're in that category, it's like, I don't know, whatever.
[4890.44 → 4891.58] LTT multi hammer.
[4891.74 → 4892.94] Thank you, Conrad for that.
[4892.94 → 4900.08] Wait, it could be a hammer and a crowbar.
[4900.08 → 4900.60] And a crowbar.
[4902.40 → 4903.10] Stop it.
[4904.54 → 4906.54] Um, yeah, I don't know.
[4906.60 → 4910.04] And like, obviously it's a strategy that works for other brands.
[4910.04 → 4914.72] Like I, I forget who it is, but some, one of those worksite brands has like a radio.
[4915.18 → 4916.52] Oh, like all of them?
[4916.70 → 4918.30] $200 or $250.
[4918.76 → 4920.50] Because they run off the tool batteries.
[4920.52 → 4920.54] Because they run off the tool batteries.
[4920.54 → 4921.10] Because they run off the tool batteries.
[4921.10 → 4921.42] Yeah.
[4921.82 → 4927.18] Like a rugged, rugged espresso machine for manly espresso drinkers.
[4927.20 → 4927.22] Yeah.
[4927.22 → 4928.58] And it probably runs off the tool batteries.
[4928.60 → 4928.90] It does.
[4929.00 → 4929.20] Yeah.
[4929.46 → 4930.20] They find a way.
[4930.62 → 4932.16] Everything will run off the tool batteries.
[4932.38 → 4932.58] Yeah.
[4932.70 → 4937.20] So, so, you know what, that's something that in the longer term, maybe we do just have to
[4937.20 → 4941.98] kind of figure out, and maybe we, you know, 3X the engineering team.
[4941.98 → 4943.12] No, I think that's a joke.
[4943.64 → 4946.66] Maybe we 3X the engineering team and then, yeah, we just make a hammer.
[4946.78 → 4947.68] We make flush cutters.
[4947.78 → 4949.74] We make, you know, Ethernet crimps.
[4949.80 → 4954.02] And as long as they're, as long as they're good enough, and they're priced reasonably-is,
[4954.36 → 4956.56] then, hey, well, we'll have that.
[4956.62 → 4957.22] Oh my God.
[4959.46 → 4960.82] Doesn't it come with a battery?
[4967.20 → 4968.12] Good Lord.
[4968.44 → 4969.56] Of course they do.
[4969.86 → 4971.16] I don't know why I doubted it.
[4972.66 → 4974.20] I don't know why I doubted it.
[4974.62 → 4978.10] That photo of it just on the ground is so golden to me.
[4978.10 → 4979.96] I'm gonna heat up my work hot pockets.
[4981.06 → 4981.78] Oh man.
[4981.78 → 4982.84] Oh my God.
[4983.44 → 4984.08] Yeah, of course.
[4985.06 → 4987.46] I think that we should do an espresso grinder.
[4987.80 → 4990.34] Maybe there's a middle ground to be found here.
[4990.42 → 4991.72] I don't think we need a microwave.
[4993.24 → 4994.36] Now you have to.
[4994.36 → 4999.42] Can you imagine being the like engineer at Marita who's tasked with this?
[4999.54 → 4999.90] I'm sorry.
[5000.04 → 5000.08] What?
[5000.18 → 5000.52] No, no, no.
[5000.54 → 5001.34] They would have a meeting.
[5001.46 → 5003.68] They'd all be drunk, and they'd just be like microwave.
[5004.30 → 5005.30] Oh my God, dude.
[5005.38 → 5005.52] Yeah.
[5005.52 → 5006.00] Let's show a microwave.
[5006.02 → 5006.78] Let's go.
[5007.10 → 5007.88] We'll make it blue.
[5008.02 → 5008.78] What a great idea.
[5009.02 → 5009.54] It's kind of sad.
[5009.60 → 5011.06] I bet you they sold these to be honest.
[5011.44 → 5012.14] Oh, I'd buy one.
[5012.14 → 5014.50] I would definitely buy one as like a flex.
[5015.02 → 5015.30] Yeah.
[5015.38 → 5017.28] If you're on like a fairly remote job site.
[5017.36 → 5018.72] And you own Marita stuff anyway.
[5018.72 → 5023.12] And they don't have any like, uh, like, I don't know.
[5023.12 → 5027.50] This is like if you, if you gave SEB no budget or oversight.
[5029.18 → 5030.50] Hey, you can do whatever you want.
[5030.88 → 5031.76] It's a blank job.
[5031.78 → 5032.24] Very powerful.
[5032.44 → 5032.74] Like a wife.
[5034.62 → 5035.98] And SEB wouldn't build that.
[5036.04 → 5038.28] Made out of failed screwdriver shafts.
[5038.30 → 5039.82] SEB would build a folding microwave.
[5039.82 → 5044.06] Ikea, assemble it yourself.
[5045.30 → 5046.06] Oh man.
[5046.24 → 5048.70] I don't think we're going to do a pocket knife anytime soon.
[5049.44 → 5053.58] Uh, and we're definitely not doing whatever that other, whatever that thing, that other
[5053.58 → 5053.86] person.
[5053.98 → 5055.82] Oh, LTT pizza oven though.
[5056.88 → 5057.72] I like it.
[5057.80 → 5059.04] You could have a computer in it.
[5060.16 → 5061.72] Double as a computer case.
[5061.84 → 5062.68] It crypto mines.
[5062.68 → 5067.70] What if you made a warming thing where it, it just, you mounted like a radiator to it,
[5067.74 → 5069.80] like a computer radiator to it.
[5070.12 → 5070.62] I'd be down.
[5070.90 → 5075.72] Didn't, uh, didn't the PlayStation or the Xbox do that for with a like a Pizza Hut or something.
[5075.90 → 5076.18] Yeah.
[5076.52 → 5077.18] I don't remember who it was.
[5077.24 → 5078.66] Someone meted on that at some point.
[5078.74 → 5079.34] I can't remember.
[5079.58 → 5081.88] I can, uh, yeah, I can't remember exactly who.
[5082.00 → 5083.00] Was it KFC did a console?
[5083.30 → 5083.42] KFC.
[5083.68 → 5083.90] Yeah.
[5084.10 → 5084.14] Yeah.
[5084.22 → 5084.58] KFC.
[5085.28 → 5085.92] Um, okay.
[5086.56 → 5087.80] Do you want to merge?
[5087.90 → 5089.14] Have we actually done one yet?
[5089.28 → 5089.46] No.
[5089.54 → 5091.22] Did we even explain what they are?
[5091.52 → 5092.28] Yeah, I did.
[5092.38 → 5092.72] Oh, wait.
[5092.72 → 5094.14] We didn't explain how to send one.
[5094.38 → 5095.04] Ah, there we go.
[5095.10 → 5095.88] Oh, you go to LTT.
[5096.34 → 5096.94] You go to LTT.
[5096.94 → 5100.22] I knew something was wrong.
[5104.34 → 5108.22] You go to LTTstore.com, you add something to your cart, you'll see a box.
[5108.38 → 5110.78] There'll be a thing when we're live.
[5110.90 → 5111.38] The box.
[5111.38 → 5118.68] And then you put a merge message in there, and then when you place your order, it will
[5118.68 → 5119.74] go to Producer Dan.
[5119.86 → 5120.54] Hey, there it is.
[5121.04 → 5121.48] Look at that.
[5121.52 → 5123.44] I would like to, I would like to merge message.
[5124.08 → 5128.06] And, um, this guy will look at it.
[5129.32 → 5132.22] Am I bad at my job, or are these guys just uncontrollable?
[5132.22 → 5134.68] Um, God, why not both?
[5135.74 → 5136.68] Yeah, sure.
[5137.44 → 5140.20] Uh, okay, I will now read you one of those things.
[5140.40 → 5140.80] Nice.
[5143.38 → 5143.92] Hi, DLL.
[5144.18 → 5146.46] Are there any updates regarding cable testing?
[5146.66 → 5149.58] I got scammed on a Type-C to DP cable recently.
[5149.94 → 5152.62] It couldn't do 4K 240Hz, as advertised.
[5153.18 → 5155.54] And I was wondering if Labs is going to do cable testing.
[5155.54 → 5162.66] So we are currently working on cable testing from both ends of the organizational noodle.
[5163.18 → 5168.18] Um, the Creator Warehouse team is working on the development of our own cables.
[5168.48 → 5174.08] And the Labs team, obviously, um, is interested in using our cable tester.
[5174.32 → 5180.80] But beyond being interested in it, um, I don't think we have much in the way of plans to start
[5180.80 → 5182.74] publishing any kind of cable testing.
[5182.74 → 5186.46] We did a couple of LTT videos with our cable tester back in the day.
[5186.58 → 5192.26] But the thing that we ran up against is that while it's a really cool device, it's limited
[5192.26 → 5194.70] in terms of what it can test.
[5194.80 → 5197.70] We can't test anything that has a chip in it.
[5197.86 → 5201.90] So no optical cables, uh, no Thunderbolt cables.
[5202.28 → 5208.24] Um, and we can't test past, I think it was, I'm probably going to get this wrong.
[5208.30 → 5209.62] It was either 10 gigabit per second.
[5209.62 → 5212.30] I think it was 10 gigabit per second or something like that.
[5212.38 → 5212.94] USB-C.
[5213.36 → 5218.78] And USB-C now, or USB now goes to 20, 40 gigabits per second.
[5219.58 → 5222.70] And I, is it like USB 4 Gen 2 or something?
[5222.70 → 5224.08] I can't remember the branding for it.
[5224.10 → 5231.36] But there is USB 4 branding for what would be the Thunderbolt 5 data rates.
[5231.58 → 5235.22] But I don't know, I don't remember if they need chips in the cables or if they like only
[5235.22 → 5236.36] work over very short runs.
[5236.36 → 5238.58] Because I, I'm, I'm a little fuzzy on the details.
[5238.72 → 5240.34] I haven't had to do a video about it recently.
[5240.68 → 5243.20] So you'll have to forgive me if I'm wrong.
[5243.28 → 5247.82] But either way, that cable tester would be getting nowhere near 80 gigabits per second.
[5248.04 → 5249.38] It's just not fast enough.
[5249.38 → 5257.00] And the tools that can get that fast are not so convenient as that device was.
[5257.14 → 5262.84] They may have modules that are, that are, that can work for these faster data rates now.
[5262.90 → 5264.38] I don't think we've looked into it for a while.
[5264.38 → 5272.02] But basically, short version of the story is that for the development of our branded cables,
[5272.16 → 5274.88] we used a third party to do testing and validation.
[5275.56 → 5279.56] Because we do have cables that are going to be rated for 20 gigabits.
[5279.64 → 5283.78] And we needed to be able to test those in a way that was reliable.
[5284.70 → 5287.44] Can't just, can't just, you know, take anyone's word for it.
[5287.46 → 5290.66] If we're going to put our, put our label on the, on the product.
[5290.66 → 5293.16] And I'm very excited about the cables.
[5293.30 → 5294.38] They're, they're chunky.
[5294.82 → 5300.48] They're like noticeably contribute to the weight of what I'm carrying.
[5300.76 → 5303.58] There was a but I trust it.
[5303.62 → 5304.44] It works every time.
[5304.60 → 5310.78] There was a fun moment down in that city that we were in, uh, doing the, the land house tours thing.
[5311.12 → 5315.04] Where somebody was, I think we were talking about LTD store and how we make like good stuff.
[5315.64 → 5319.22] And then somebody there was like, oh no, it's, I think they, no, no.
[5319.22 → 5320.30] They know where the city is.
[5320.66 → 5321.14] Oh, okay.
[5321.16 → 5322.24] People know where the land house is.
[5322.34 → 5322.42] Yeah.
[5322.42 → 5322.88] It's in Austin.
[5323.06 → 5323.24] Yeah.
[5323.42 → 5324.06] I just wasn't sure.
[5324.20 → 5324.32] Yeah.
[5324.44 → 5327.14] Uh, but somebody there was like, oh, you should make USB cables.
[5327.24 → 5328.94] I'm like so tired of all these.
[5329.02 → 5329.64] I, I don't remember.
[5329.70 → 5334.18] I think it was like, um, like hobby radio operating.
[5334.44 → 5334.76] Oh yeah.
[5334.76 → 5335.16] That's right.
[5335.24 → 5336.62] Some issue with some cable.
[5336.62 → 5340.26] And you were like, uh, I mean these and pulled one out of your pocket.
[5340.46 → 5341.46] That was a pretty fun one.
[5341.46 → 5342.10] And they looked at it.
[5342.12 → 5344.12] They were like, okay, like how is it made?
[5344.14 → 5346.64] And I was like, oh, coaxial, all the things.
[5346.64 → 5348.40] And they were like, oh yeah.
[5348.40 → 5352.74] Yeah, it's going to be expensive, but like there's people that will have applications
[5352.74 → 5356.46] for them and there are no other cables like this as far as my understanding goes.
[5356.46 → 5358.12] So like it is what it is.
[5358.18 → 5359.96] They were like, it's pretty thick.
[5360.06 → 5362.44] There's, there's no way every conductor is shielded in there.
[5362.46 → 5365.18] And I'm like, don't make me cut it open.
[5365.18 → 5367.30] Really don't make me cut it open.
[5367.30 → 5369.18] Last time we did that, it was a problem.
[5370.86 → 5371.18] Um.
[5372.38 → 5375.44] I feel like almost as a joke, you should like cut one in half for the product page.
[5375.54 → 5375.96] Like show.
[5376.66 → 5377.28] Not even a joke.
[5377.40 → 5377.54] Yeah.
[5377.68 → 5377.90] Yeah.
[5377.98 → 5378.40] No, no.
[5378.40 → 5378.76] That'd be cool.
[5379.02 → 5379.16] Yeah.
[5379.16 → 5380.34] Because we'll have cable stock.
[5380.54 → 5380.72] Yeah.
[5380.72 → 5381.94] We still have cable stock.
[5382.00 → 5383.08] Like we have cable stock now.
[5383.16 → 5384.24] We could, we could show it to people.
[5384.36 → 5384.76] That makes sense.
[5384.76 → 5391.88] But yeah, no, they're it's, they are very, very high quality cables, and I'm very, very
[5391.88 → 5394.14] excited for them to arrive at some point.
[5394.18 → 5394.58] Eventually.
[5395.02 → 5397.16] Um, we're, we're working on it, and we're going to do it right.
[5397.48 → 5402.46] And then if USB cables are a success, we'd, we'd like to do, we'd like to do more than
[5402.46 → 5402.68] that.
[5403.14 → 5406.50] Um, I don't think we're going to get into fibre optic anytime soon.
[5406.62 → 5410.66] So we're going to do quality copper conductor cables.
[5411.06 → 5413.36] Um, and then we will see how it goes.
[5413.42 → 5413.98] I mean, who knows?
[5413.98 → 5419.50] Maybe it'll be a huge smash hit for us, and we'll be like, oh, we'd be crazy to not invest
[5419.50 → 5423.30] in, in figuring out optical cables, but we need to get this over the line first.
[5423.62 → 5423.82] Yeah.
[5424.94 → 5425.62] Gotta do one.
[5425.76 → 5430.02] Sometimes I wonder what our business would be like if we took a more like, just like
[5430.02 → 5433.30] go hard, um, approach.
[5433.80 → 5438.52] Like we, we kind of did a middle ground approach and that didn't work very well where we like
[5438.52 → 5442.62] hired people without, you know, proper management structures, but there are other ways to do things.
[5442.62 → 5447.44] Like you can, you can like to go out and, uh, you know, look at how Mr. Beast did feast ables.
[5447.44 → 5449.94] It's not like he tried to be the CEO of a chocolate company.
[5449.94 → 5454.38] He just hired a team of experienced people from the snack industry and was like, okay,
[5454.38 → 5454.64] go.
[5455.30 → 5460.18] Um, and you can, you can see it reflected in the lower profitability, obviously.
[5460.36 → 5460.66] Yeah.
[5460.66 → 5465.98] Um, like I think the, the numbers were something like 30 million on like 300 million in sales
[5465.98 → 5466.92] or something like that.
[5466.98 → 5469.60] But still that's like, that's healthy enough.
[5469.94 → 5470.28] $30 million.
[5470.56 → 5474.90] I was just surprised to see that he's apparently still losing money on the video production side.
[5475.64 → 5479.48] Um, I've taken what, like 450 million in investment.
[5479.48 → 5481.36] Like, I don't know.
[5481.58 → 5483.28] I, I hear you.
[5483.58 → 5486.80] Some of the stuff that they do though, it's like, oh God.
[5486.86 → 5487.10] Yeah.
[5487.10 → 5488.16] That would be really expensive.
[5488.34 → 5488.64] Yeah.
[5488.74 → 5490.84] Like unfathomably expensive.
[5491.62 → 5496.84] Um, I just don't really understand why he bothers to do that anymore.
[5496.84 → 5499.58] Like some of the more humanitarian philanthropic stuff.
[5499.68 → 5499.86] Sure.
[5499.96 → 5500.58] Yeah, absolutely.
[5500.76 → 5503.52] But some of the just like, a lot of that's on another channel.
[5503.86 → 5504.24] Yeah.
[5504.24 → 5507.92] But some of the, well, not always like the, the blindness one was, was not.
[5507.94 → 5510.14] He just, he has Mr. Beast philanthropy.
[5510.24 → 5510.66] No, no, I know.
[5511.16 → 5515.58] Um, but just like the for the just the spectacle videos, I just feel like he doesn't really,
[5516.10 → 5518.90] he's such a creative guy.
[5519.60 → 5525.14] I feel like he just doesn't have to rely on a big price tag anymore, but he, and, and,
[5525.14 → 5529.08] and sometimes it's not just, you know, like a bigger prize or a more expensive, you know,
[5529.18 → 5530.96] Lamborghini and a crushing machine or whatever.
[5530.96 → 5536.64] Like sometimes it comes more down to elaborate sets and, and, uh, just doing things in a
[5536.68 → 5537.46] in a novel way.
[5537.46 → 5544.54] But I, it, it just seems like at some point, um, it might be nice to, to make that a sustainable
[5544.54 → 5545.36] machine as well.
[5546.12 → 5549.56] Um, those things could both be true.
[5549.72 → 5550.54] That's a nice hat.
[5551.06 → 5557.04] I love how he got like super cancelled and just, it didn't matter at all.
[5558.26 → 5559.82] Just looking at his channel right now.
[5559.82 → 5563.98] Well, I mean, it's not like he's, you know, his influence is important or anything.
[5563.98 → 5568.08] It's not like he's, uh, he, you know, an error on a graph could potentially make someone
[5568.08 → 5570.86] buy the wrong graphics card and regret it for the rest of their life.
[5570.90 → 5571.32] That's true.
[5571.78 → 5572.78] So that's true.
[5572.84 → 5574.82] We have to have different standards for different people.
[5574.94 → 5575.20] Yeah.
[5575.66 → 5578.58] It's all about the importance of, you know, what's going on.
[5578.58 → 5579.90] Like someone's gaming.
[5580.64 → 5581.90] That could be impacted.
[5582.08 → 5582.72] That's a life.
[5582.88 → 5583.58] Think about it.
[5583.66 → 5584.26] That's a life.
[5584.36 → 5584.96] Think about it.
[5585.04 → 5587.28] Imagine that life went on without ray tracing.
[5587.28 → 5588.64] Dang it.
[5588.64 → 5589.40] You got there first.
[5590.00 → 5591.24] I'm too slow today.
[5591.72 → 5593.72] I felt like you were cooking for it too.
[5594.18 → 5595.08] I was like, I will win this.
[5595.80 → 5597.28] You got me so good.
[5597.42 → 5600.12] I wanted to get there first, but my brain is so bad.
[5603.72 → 5604.12] Anyway.
[5604.12 → 5607.84] How about the float plane announcement?
[5608.34 → 5609.54] Did we do two merch messages?
[5609.54 → 5610.10] No, we didn't.
[5610.28 → 5611.58] We did only one, I think.
[5611.94 → 5612.50] I'm pretty sure.
[5612.64 → 5613.78] We did one merch message.
[5613.94 → 5617.28] Do you want to read the title of float plane announcements?
[5618.26 → 5619.48] After first merch message?
[5619.68 → 5619.82] Okay.
[5620.10 → 5621.30] Oh, sure.
[5622.86 → 5626.30] Next week, we will have a stream with Sarah.
[5626.70 → 5628.98] Let's watch the announcement with audio, please.
[5628.98 → 5629.84] Is this another float plane?
[5629.84 → 5631.62] If it is, I need to buy this one.
[5633.26 → 5633.70] Yes.
[5634.10 → 5634.84] Okay, cool.
[5634.96 → 5637.12] Because I didn't plan complaining about that.
[5637.40 → 5637.70] Okay.
[5639.10 → 5640.32] I already like the vibe.
[5641.00 → 5642.72] See if the audio is going to work.
[5643.22 → 5643.72] Sure, go for it.
[5644.20 → 5645.04] All right, they can hear it.
[5645.56 → 5646.76] Now, you want to hear it.
[5648.84 → 5650.50] Well, it's Derby Dino's.
[5650.50 → 5656.70] Welcome to Streams with Sarah.
[5657.34 → 5658.06] What am I?
[5658.06 → 5664.16] See us on float plane live next Thursday, where I will be drawing Derby Dino's with your contribution.
[5664.86 → 5665.56] See you there.
[5667.04 → 5668.30] Is it going to be a product?
[5668.94 → 5669.94] I mean, yeah.
[5670.30 → 5671.66] Or is she just drawing Derby Dino's?
[5671.80 → 5675.24] Jurassic Park is, that's a pretty timely cultural reference, right?
[5676.00 → 5677.64] Did you hear them playing it on the recorder?
[5677.94 → 5679.72] Yeah, no, I thought that was great.
[5679.72 → 5681.82] I'm wondering if that's going to be a product.
[5682.10 → 5685.30] Because I don't think they said, like, her previous ones, they made shirts out of it.
[5685.38 → 5686.12] That's the hat.
[5686.94 → 5692.76] Yeah, it took me way too long to get that because I'm really stupid right now, but that's crazy.
[5693.30 → 5694.06] That's awesome.
[5694.52 → 5696.78] Sorry, I didn't even realize it took you that long to get that.
[5696.98 → 5697.26] Oh, dude.
[5697.26 → 5697.74] I wasn't.
[5697.86 → 5699.24] I got there at the very end.
[5699.84 → 5700.20] Okay.
[5700.50 → 5701.10] Yeah, buddy.
[5702.98 → 5703.34] Cool.
[5704.08 → 5705.36] Yeah, great job, team.
[5705.36 → 5706.62] You didn't get it from the head turn?
[5706.84 → 5707.16] No.
[5707.64 → 5708.50] And the dinosaur?
[5708.50 → 5709.22] Yeah, not even.
[5709.38 → 5715.46] I was literally at Universal Studios riding around on, like, Jurassic Park rides two and
[5715.46 → 5717.98] a half days ago, and it still took me that long.
[5718.12 → 5718.38] Wow.
[5718.86 → 5719.52] That's awesome.
[5720.92 → 5725.28] But yeah, I don't know, because I know with a lot of these previous streams, they've turned
[5725.28 → 5728.44] them into shirts or one time even it was like a poster, I think.
[5730.68 → 5732.08] Man, I'm not sure.
[5732.62 → 5734.06] It's some kind of design stream.
[5734.06 → 5734.70] Oh, here we go.
[5735.24 → 5739.66] As promised, we'll be selling the Content Cosmos design as a poster during the stream,
[5739.84 → 5744.02] exclusively for Float plane subscribers, or as I like to call them, floaters.
[5744.34 → 5749.76] If you don't know what the Content Cosmos looks like, here it is, and I don't have access
[5749.76 → 5750.06] to this.
[5750.06 → 5751.90] Neither do I, so I can't.
[5752.30 → 5752.60] Nice.
[5752.86 → 5753.70] Give me a second.
[5753.70 → 5755.00] Dan's working on it.
[5755.02 → 5755.58] He's working on it.
[5755.58 → 5756.02] He's cooking.
[5756.16 → 5756.64] Let him cook.
[5757.12 → 5759.84] Go subscribe at leg.GG slash float plane.
[5759.98 → 5761.96] Not on YouTube, because we don't stream there.
[5762.70 → 5764.40] Well, we don't stream this there.
[5764.52 → 5766.22] We're streaming something there right now.
[5766.44 → 5766.92] It's that.
[5766.92 → 5767.16] Yay!
[5768.62 → 5769.50] Oh, that's sick.
[5770.14 → 5770.58] That was it?
[5770.62 → 5771.74] You were only going to show it for that long?
[5771.82 → 5773.92] We're not going to get to appreciate it?
[5775.78 → 5776.58] It's pretty cool.
[5777.96 → 5778.72] It's pretty cool.
[5779.28 → 5781.54] Sammy had that shirt when we were down at the place.
[5781.82 → 5782.48] That's amazing.
[5782.64 → 5783.22] Send friend.
[5785.00 → 5786.32] Okay, next merch message.
[5786.88 → 5787.76] Yeah, we're getting there.
[5787.76 → 5794.54] With a recent flurry of 30-day challenges, is Graphene OS something you would do and explore?
[5795.88 → 5795.90] Oh.
[5796.92 → 5797.88] Um.
[5798.54 → 5799.58] Custom phone OS.
[5800.24 → 5801.28] I guess so.
[5803.30 → 5804.68] It's such a hassle.
[5806.12 → 5807.86] Yeah, it really is.
[5807.90 → 5808.38] It's awful.
[5808.54 → 5810.54] Doing phone stuff is really annoying.
[5811.56 → 5816.94] And, like, it's like getting into Linux stuff, where no matter how right you do it,
[5817.36 → 5819.12] everyone will just kind of hate you for it anyway.
[5819.30 → 5821.44] And it's like, why do I even bother talking to you people?
[5823.04 → 5823.48] Wow.
[5824.02 → 5825.22] The, uh, wow.
[5825.22 → 5827.92] Oh, I thought you were wowing at me being spicy.
[5828.04 → 5828.60] No, no, no, no, no.
[5828.70 → 5831.04] I went to their website and was looking at stuff.
[5831.44 → 5831.66] Yeah.
[5831.66 → 5834.00] And I was like, oh, they have a features tab.
[5834.28 → 5835.78] I wonder what features they have.
[5835.92 → 5838.12] And then I was like, wow, this is really dense.
[5838.34 → 5838.68] Okay.
[5838.68 → 5839.46] And I started scrolling.
[5839.46 → 5841.24] And I was like, whoa.
[5841.44 → 5843.92] And then I kept scrolling and was like, oh.
[5847.78 → 5848.18] Wow.
[5848.18 → 5848.98] What features do you have?
[5849.28 → 5849.68] Yes.
[5850.00 → 5850.36] Yes.
[5850.36 → 5853.04] Wow.
[5854.38 → 5854.82] Wow.
[5855.02 → 5855.50] Wow.
[5855.50 → 5855.90] Wow.
[5855.90 → 5855.98] Wow.
[5855.98 → 5856.34] Wow.
[5856.34 → 5856.94] Wow.
[5856.94 → 5857.38] Wow.
[5857.58 → 5857.94] Wow.
[5858.18 → 5860.14] Um, yeah, I would consider it.
[5860.20 → 5862.38] It's just, yeah, it's such a it's such a hassle.
[5862.50 → 5868.52] And the things that differentiate phones for me these days are just totally not really the
[5868.52 → 5869.34] OS that much.
[5869.34 → 5875.62] Like you guys probably noticed that I'm long past my 30 days that I committed to do on the
[5875.62 → 5875.98] iPhone.
[5876.28 → 5876.42] Yeah.
[5876.56 → 5878.90] I super-duper don't love it.
[5878.90 → 5884.96] I still have some weird buggy behaviour that I have not invested the time into fixing and
[5884.96 → 5885.98] therefore haven't fixed.
[5886.08 → 5888.44] Like I've got this, this is a really weird one.
[5888.66 → 5889.54] Check this out.
[5889.64 → 5892.50] If I, when I open, oh, this one worked.
[5892.60 → 5893.58] This is so bizarre.
[5893.76 → 5899.28] So sometimes when I click a link to a Google doc, it, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[5899.28 → 5899.94] That was user error.
[5900.00 → 5900.68] I clicked the wrong spot.
[5900.80 → 5903.04] It like totally opens a Google doc.
[5903.30 → 5907.98] And then, uh, I saw, I had it today with, uh, Chewy's community report.
[5908.34 → 5909.08] Here it is.
[5909.50 → 5915.30] So sometimes when I open a Google doc, it's like, yo, do you want to open with Chrome
[5915.30 → 5918.98] or Google app or Safari?
[5920.20 → 5923.68] And it doesn't prompt me for anything other than a browser.
[5923.68 → 5933.38] So I, I don't recall setting it to open with a browser, um, like a Google doc link in my
[5933.38 → 5936.40] email, but I like, can't accept calendar invitations sometimes.
[5936.40 → 5938.18] And I can't open Google Docs.
[5938.18 → 5942.76] Because I just have to go close the app and then just like open the docs app and then go to
[5942.76 → 5943.58] shared with me.
[5944.26 → 5947.22] Um, someone says click Safari.
[5947.32 → 5948.32] It'll open in docs.
[5948.42 → 5952.08] I promise you it won't watch this Safari.
[5952.08 → 5952.22] Safari.
[5953.08 → 5955.54] And it opens in Safari.
[5958.54 → 5960.08] Or it prompts me to sign in rather.
[5960.38 → 5962.64] I am 100% signed in.
[5962.74 → 5963.88] Oh, wait, hold on a second.
[5963.94 → 5964.40] Is that docs?
[5965.40 → 5966.20] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5966.20 → 5966.44] No, no.
[5966.46 → 5966.72] Hold on.
[5966.76 → 5967.06] Hold on.
[5967.28 → 5968.52] Wait, what is this?
[5969.12 → 5969.36] Oh no.
[5969.50 → 5969.76] Okay.
[5969.80 → 5971.38] No, that's just my password manager.
[5971.56 → 5975.26] So I'm a hundred percent signed in because I can open that doc here.
[5976.08 → 5980.96] This is, this is the doc that was shared with me, but for whatever reason I click done,
[5981.22 → 5982.22] I try to open it here.
[5982.32 → 5985.94] I am literally in the email inbox of the one that I just showed you.
[5986.30 → 5987.42] People are like, that's a Google thing.
[5987.48 → 5989.98] Well, that's nice, but it's a crappy experience.
[5989.98 → 5993.32] I use Google for my organization, so it's bad.
[5994.10 → 5996.64] Um, I don't recall, I don't recall ever setting it to do that.
[5996.72 → 6000.54] I'm not saying I didn't look, calm the fuck down.
[6000.86 → 6003.60] So you need to be signed in in Safari, and then it opens it in docs.
[6003.70 → 6004.76] That's so whack.
[6005.90 → 6006.18] What?
[6006.54 → 6007.04] Why would I?
[6007.20 → 6010.36] Joshua Carroll in full plane chat is saying you need to be signed in Safari and then it
[6010.36 → 6011.04] will work.
[6015.28 → 6016.70] Why did it work the other time?
[6017.30 → 6017.84] Who knows?
[6017.88 → 6020.38] You just saw me open a different Google doc, and it did work.
[6020.52 → 6020.74] Yeah.
[6022.12 → 6023.04] I have no idea.
[6024.40 → 6027.16] Is it, is it specific types of docs?
[6027.36 → 6031.66] Like do docs open in one, but sheets open in another?
[6031.72 → 6032.46] They were both docs.
[6032.54 → 6033.10] They were both docs.
[6033.26 → 6033.74] Here, hold on.
[6033.78 → 6034.82] Which one was the one I tried to show?
[6034.88 → 6035.00] Yeah.
[6035.26 → 6037.48] The one I tried to show you was the logistics weekly update.
[6037.60 → 6038.36] Which is a doc.
[6038.44 → 6038.62] Yeah.
[6038.68 → 6042.78] And that one opened in drive and then docs and a hundred percent opened.
[6042.90 → 6043.42] I don't know.
[6043.96 → 6046.06] Um, yeah.
[6047.02 → 6048.66] You were already in that doc in the Google Docs.
[6048.66 → 6049.44] No, that's not the issue.
[6049.44 → 6057.32] Um, yeah, it is bizarre how defensive people will get about this.
[6057.38 → 6059.08] I'm not attacking iOS right now.
[6059.56 → 6060.92] Right from the very start.
[6060.92 → 6064.68] I said, I do not recall configuring it to do this.
[6064.68 → 6065.68] I left an opening for it.
[6065.68 → 6070.74] I left an opening for it being very possible that I configured something incorrectly.
[6070.74 → 6075.20] And before that I said that I haven't investigated.
[6075.20 → 6079.92] But the behaviour is certainly very weird.
[6079.92 → 6082.98] My point, let's not lose the point.
[6082.98 → 6091.00] My point was that even with that inconvenience, the operating system of my phone just doesn't
[6091.00 → 6092.30] matter that much to me these days.
[6092.30 → 6105.24] I'm clearly still using this because in spite of the fact that I have some inconveniences, there are inconveniences in pretty much everything, whether it's Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, they all have inconveniences.
[6106.30 → 6108.10] And it just doesn't matter that much.
[6108.86 → 6113.14] I had Theo, T3 Theo, watch your iPhone video.
[6114.04 → 6114.60] Oh yeah.
[6114.60 → 6114.64] Yeah.
[6115.38 → 6120.60] He's an Apple device enjoyer, like fairly intensely.
[6121.70 → 6127.40] And yeah, he had some minor disagrees, but for the most part he was like, yeah, agreed.
[6127.80 → 6140.02] I really do think that Apple needs to bring some non Apple users into their product development process because the kind of just acceptance of stuff that is just obviously wrong.
[6140.02 → 6146.08] And when I say wrong, you know, from like a product design standpoint, what I mean is inconsistent.
[6146.90 → 6161.22] When the same action can do two different things or two different actions, actually, no, two different actions to do the same thing is fine because then as long as the documentation is clear and as long as they each have a distinct purpose, then that can be down to user preference.
[6161.22 → 6165.52] But when the same action gets you two different results, that's not great.
[6166.18 → 6166.46] Yeah.
[6166.70 → 6169.68] He had some interesting comments on stuff like that as well.
[6170.02 → 6179.92] Like, and I don't, this wasn't him like refuting your comment, but it was just like a discussion piece that Android's the only operating system that has a universal back.
[6181.46 → 6181.98] Yeah.
[6182.16 → 6182.90] Of any kind.
[6183.24 → 6183.46] Yeah.
[6183.48 → 6184.94] I can't think of another one that does.
[6185.20 → 6186.46] Even Chrome OS doesn't.
[6186.68 → 6186.86] Yeah.
[6188.24 → 6189.80] Which is an interesting observation.
[6189.80 → 6190.34] Interesting comment.
[6190.34 → 6194.06] He wasn't saying like, therefore, it should be fine that Apple, he wasn't saying that.
[6194.36 → 6195.42] He's just pointing out.
[6195.68 → 6203.80] I think the closest that we've had, like on the Windows side was back when Escape pretty consistently closed what you were doing.
[6204.66 → 6205.44] Or like.
[6205.46 → 6207.22] It still does pretty good with that.
[6207.28 → 6208.02] Or went out.
[6208.02 → 6209.38] Well, yes and no.
[6209.50 → 6219.04] Because like programs now, they'll want Alt-F4, or they'll want F10 and then navigating a menu tree and or whatever.
[6219.04 → 6226.52] Like there's, I would say actually from like a from a back navigation standpoint, we've regressed.
[6226.64 → 6227.26] Oh, 100%.
[6227.26 → 6227.82] On Windows.
[6227.96 → 6228.12] Yeah.
[6228.72 → 6232.28] I'm just saying it's not like gone, but we've definitely regressed a lot.
[6232.38 → 6232.64] Okay.
[6233.18 → 6234.16] Short side rant.
[6234.16 → 6237.42] Both Microsoft and Apple.
[6237.42 → 6242.98] Fix your shit when it comes to force close.
[6244.06 → 6244.94] Both of you.
[6245.62 → 6252.98] I freaking, I ran into an issue on, on the Mac recently where like I couldn't close something.
[6252.98 → 6255.84] And I have to go up in the menu and go force close.
[6258.32 → 6260.40] That makes me so mad.
[6260.78 → 6261.88] Why do I have to do that?
[6262.00 → 6263.36] The red button is literally there.
[6263.42 → 6264.26] I'm telling you close.
[6264.86 → 6265.78] I mean close.
[6266.52 → 6267.38] You could prompt me.
[6267.70 → 6268.70] Do you want to force close?
[6268.84 → 6269.88] You know, this is not responding.
[6269.98 → 6270.72] Do you want to force close?
[6270.94 → 6271.94] But just bring it to me.
[6271.98 → 6273.20] Why do I have to go looking for it?
[6273.20 → 6275.34] And I want to make this very clear.
[6275.48 → 6277.06] I'm not singling out Apple here.
[6277.72 → 6279.72] Microsoft for years and years and years.
[6279.84 → 6281.00] And I'd love, you know what?
[6281.68 → 6282.56] Invitation time.
[6283.06 → 6288.00] I'd love to have a Microsoft developer come on the show and explain this one to me.
[6288.42 → 6294.80] Because I will run into situations where an app is so hung that not only does not click,
[6294.92 → 6300.40] does click X not do anything, but going into the task manager, and it's like not responding
[6300.40 → 6304.84] or whatever and like trying to end the task, the Windows equivalent of force close, doesn't
[6304.84 → 6305.40] do anything.
[6306.30 → 6311.46] But the system's not locked up, and you can make it go away by logging out.
[6312.08 → 6314.36] I would love to have it explained to me.
[6314.68 → 6319.82] And you will see, you'll see when you log out, your apps all gracefully close.
[6320.54 → 6326.92] So I would love to have it explained to me why force close or end task or whatever doesn't
[6326.92 → 6329.16] just use whatever mechanism they use when I log out.
[6329.16 → 6330.88] Just do that.
[6332.52 → 6340.96] Please tell me you are invited to come on the WAN show because maybe there is a super sensible
[6340.96 → 6341.96] explanation for it.
[6343.22 → 6351.32] Like maybe some critical process or whatever can be had to be closed first in order to
[6351.32 → 6352.42] do that or something.
[6352.50 → 6355.52] But I kind of doubt it because Explorer seems to be the last thing to go.
[6355.52 → 6355.96] Yeah.
[6356.12 → 6359.30] Like you can see the Explorer interface as all the stuff that you've been trying to
[6359.30 → 6361.80] get rid of goes away, and then it is done.
[6361.88 → 6363.48] And then it's like Explorer's gone.
[6363.64 → 6365.42] And then boom, it kicks you out to the login screen.
[6365.52 → 6365.80] It's like.
[6365.80 → 6374.42] Also, some people seem to be misinterpreting my universal back in Windows thing because
[6374.42 → 6375.82] they're like, oh, it works.
[6375.92 → 6376.26] It works.
[6376.36 → 6378.26] It works in a lot of Windows stuff.
[6378.26 → 6380.44] It works in Windows Explorer.
[6380.86 → 6381.14] What does?
[6381.54 → 6381.90] Back.
[6382.14 → 6383.32] Like a back button on your mouse.
[6383.44 → 6383.64] Alt.
[6383.86 → 6384.70] On your mouse.
[6384.90 → 6385.38] Oh, sure.
[6385.38 → 6389.16] But it doesn't actually work literally everywhere.
[6389.54 → 6390.32] Holy crap.
[6391.88 → 6394.76] I thought I would never get used to alt left.
[6396.26 → 6397.54] Like alt left key.
[6398.40 → 6398.88] Yeah.
[6399.92 → 6402.46] I don't remember what the old hockey was.
[6403.38 → 6404.46] Was it all to escape?
[6405.58 → 6406.38] I don't know.
[6406.46 → 6407.30] What was the old hockey?
[6408.58 → 6409.28] For what?
[6409.36 → 6409.78] Going back?
[6409.86 → 6409.98] Yeah.
[6410.02 → 6410.54] Going back.
[6410.82 → 6413.64] Like going back in your browser, back in Windows Explorer.
[6414.98 → 6415.36] Yeah.
[6416.24 → 6416.68] Backspace.
[6416.86 → 6417.50] That's what it was.
[6417.62 → 6417.84] Okay.
[6418.58 → 6419.34] Was that it?
[6420.34 → 6421.74] It was alt Backspace, I think.
[6423.90 → 6425.14] It wasn't just Backspace.
[6425.20 → 6426.10] No, I think it was alt Backspace.
[6426.18 → 6426.38] Okay.
[6426.70 → 6426.92] Yeah.
[6427.60 → 6427.96] Okay.
[6428.08 → 6428.28] Yeah.
[6428.36 → 6428.56] Whoa.
[6428.76 → 6429.04] Anyway.
[6429.12 → 6433.78] But yeah, the Android one, you can swipe to go back in anything at any time.
[6434.16 → 6434.42] Yeah.
[6434.54 → 6435.00] It's amazing.
[6435.10 → 6435.40] I love it.
[6435.40 → 6438.76] The Windows one, it works in a lot of Windows things, but it doesn't work.
[6439.12 → 6439.94] Oh, it was just Backspace.
[6439.94 → 6441.74] Literally everywhere, literally all the time.
[6441.74 → 6442.56] It was just Backspace.
[6442.94 → 6443.40] That's kind of wild.
[6443.40 → 6444.40] I totally forgot that.
[6444.52 → 6444.92] I don't remember that.
[6444.92 → 6445.74] That wasn't that long ago.
[6445.80 → 6447.04] It was like two years ago or something.
[6447.18 → 6447.38] Yeah.
[6447.58 → 6448.22] Three, maybe?
[6448.40 → 6449.02] I didn't use it.
[6449.14 → 6450.48] Wait, when did they change that?
[6450.60 → 6451.50] It's a CHLF.
[6451.90 → 6455.12] Yeah, I forget why they changed it, but they did it for a reason.
[6455.68 → 6460.00] But yeah, in your browser, Backspace used to go back, and now that doesn't do anything.
[6460.00 → 6464.82] Maybe it just resulted in a lot of accidentals going back.
[6464.82 → 6465.18] Probably.
[6465.18 → 6465.20] Yeah.
[6465.76 → 6466.72] That's a likely why I didn't use it.
[6466.72 → 6467.96] 10 years ago, shut up.
[6468.62 → 6469.34] No, no.
[6469.48 → 6469.98] Shut up.
[6470.22 → 6470.86] Don't even.
[6471.32 → 6472.74] That was 10 years ago?
[6473.38 → 6474.16] Shut up.
[6475.82 → 6476.26] Oh.
[6477.10 → 6477.36] Okay.
[6477.46 → 6477.58] No.
[6477.70 → 6477.90] What?
[6478.04 → 6478.60] When was it?
[6478.98 → 6479.72] When was it?
[6481.40 → 6482.38] Bad search query.
[6482.38 → 6483.38] 2016.
[6492.38 → 6493.58] That's nine years ago.
[6493.58 → 6503.86] That's rough, man.
[6505.06 → 6506.04] They disabled it.
[6506.08 → 6506.88] They blocked it.
[6506.88 → 6512.04] In July 2016, Google Chrome blocked the use of the Backspace key to navigate to a previous
[6512.04 → 6513.78] page in their Chrome 52 release.
[6514.64 → 6519.84] This was because of reports that it brings about loss of data inputted into a form on a
[6519.84 → 6521.56] page by switching to the previous page.
[6521.56 → 6526.28] And probably had a lot of mis-inputs when people thought they were in a text box field, and
[6526.28 → 6526.66] they weren't.
[6527.04 → 6527.12] Yeah.
[6527.18 → 6529.64] That's likely why I never wanted to use it.
[6530.90 → 6531.30] Whoa.
[6531.82 → 6532.86] Yeah, I used it all the time.
[6534.70 → 6535.60] Okay, cool.
[6537.26 → 6538.66] I'm a mouse enjoyer.
[6539.52 → 6539.88] Yeah.
[6540.60 → 6542.00] Well, just when I'm, I don't know.
[6543.40 → 6544.22] Keyboard's right there.
[6544.30 → 6544.80] I don't know.
[6544.86 → 6548.14] I just kind of, I'm a sporadic hotkey user.
[6548.14 → 6548.70] Oh, for sure.
[6548.78 → 6549.12] Yeah, yeah.
[6549.12 → 6552.52] Okay.
[6552.78 → 6556.12] I have used alt-left, often on laptops.
[6557.30 → 6557.66] Okay.
[6559.50 → 6561.18] But have you tried the alt-right?
[6562.98 → 6565.52] Here, you just got to press that key next to the Z and the C.
[6565.52 → 6566.12] Oh.
[6572.06 → 6572.50] Okay.
[6572.90 → 6574.54] So, what are we talking about now?
[6576.48 → 6577.42] Who knows?
[6578.54 → 6581.10] Speaking of which, Mark Robert is under fire.
[6581.18 → 6581.46] Hey!
[6582.30 → 6582.66] Oh!
[6582.66 → 6593.36] For his latest video about LiDAR that had a focus on comparing camera-only assisted driving
[6593.36 → 6597.92] systems, as found on Tesla's vehicles, to LiDAR-assisted systems.
[6597.92 → 6606.34] The big headline-grabbing test was, of course, the Wile E. Coyote-style fake highway wall that
[6606.34 → 6608.36] they erected to try to fool the cameras.
[6608.36 → 6618.00] And the video was celebrated for demonstrating why Tesla's camera-only systems are inferior to more expensive LiDAR solutions.
[6618.00 → 6624.16] Across six tests involving a variety of driving conditions, fog, heavy rain, sunset, sunrise,
[6624.16 → 6631.62] the Tesla failed to safely stop before hitting a child mannequin and or a Looney Tunes wall in three out of six tests.
[6632.30 → 6634.50] LiDAR was successful in all tests.
[6634.58 → 6639.10] However, this video drew the ire of many folks.
[6639.78 → 6641.18] Um, why?
[6642.22 → 6646.52] Well, for the one thing, the title, Can You Fool a Self-Driving Car?
[6646.94 → 6649.40] No self-driving cars appear in the video.
[6649.40 → 6654.62] Both cars are using driving assists rather than being self-driving.
[6655.14 → 6664.72] However, as I have talked about for the last 10 plus years, um, maybe not quite that long, but certainly more than five,
[6666.02 → 6669.54] Tesla's being self-driving is a pretty common misunderstanding.
[6670.08 → 6677.98] And I can see how much like, um, I made that video saying that I stole a tampon from a store.
[6677.98 → 6678.36] Right.
[6678.36 → 6679.60] When it was clearly a pad.
[6680.00 → 6681.62] That was the beginning of Evil Linus, I think.
[6681.88 → 6682.40] I think so.
[6682.54 → 6682.68] Yeah.
[6682.82 → 6690.54] Um, I can see how he might have used the term self-driving because it was easily understood across many languages,
[6691.16 → 6697.02] um, and has a strong association with the Tesla car that he was using in the test,
[6697.02 → 6700.10] even if, no, technically that car is not self-driving.
[6700.22 → 6705.28] And a big part of the reason that people associate Teslas with self-driving is that,
[6705.54 → 6713.22] A, they call their control slash lane keep assist, their auto cruise control slash lane keep assist autopilot,
[6713.46 → 6715.30] which is pretty misleading.
[6715.30 → 6722.84] And they also call their advanced driver assistants full self-driving and have been promising next year,
[6723.32 → 6728.30] complete autonomy for like, I don't, six years, something like that.
[6728.68 → 6730.66] Don't quote me on it, but quite a few years.
[6731.28 → 6734.72] Um, so was that title the best choice?
[6734.88 → 6735.98] No, probably not.
[6736.02 → 6741.68] It probably wasn't the most factually correct choice, but I can also completely understand why.
[6741.68 → 6747.58] Elon Musk first publicly announced that all Teslas would have the hardware necessary for full self-driving in 2016.
[6747.88 → 6748.20] Oh, wow.
[6748.26 → 6749.26] So nine years again.
[6749.54 → 6749.68] Nice.
[6749.86 → 6752.44] But I think he made that promise in 2016.
[6753.08 → 6754.80] Oh, he said it would be in two to three years.
[6755.10 → 6755.42] Got it.
[6755.46 → 6755.66] Okay.
[6755.82 → 6756.12] All right.
[6756.54 → 6762.48] Um, so anyway, yeah, the, the, the title probably could have been more accurate.
[6763.08 → 6771.42] Um, the other main criticism is that he was using autopilot, which is outdated.
[6771.68 → 6778.56] Uh, Tesla's full self-driving system that again, does not allow the car to drive itself unattended.
[6778.56 → 6786.60] It requires constant human supervision is far more advanced than the autopilot system and, um, has received more updates.
[6787.06 → 6799.58] However, that doesn't really change the point of his video, which is that, um, both autopilot and full self-driving rely entirely on cameras, cameras, which have fundamental limitations.
[6799.58 → 6808.70] Um, Robert has not disclosed which version of Tesla autopilot he tested, uh, and Tesla plan to roll out the ability to use full self-driving without a driver in June.
[6808.78 → 6810.82] Uh, yeah, I, I'm not, I'm not even going to say that.
[6811.26 → 6811.76] Uh, Tesla.
[6812.08 → 6812.92] Why is it even?
[6812.92 → 6817.94] Um, this is, this is, this is the MSI, uh, the MSI, uh, the MSI power thing again.
[6818.30 → 6822.32] So I should just not say anything that a manufacturer says at this point then.
[6822.62 → 6822.94] Yeah.
[6823.18 → 6830.16] Um, Tesla says that they're going to do that, but hey, they first said, uh, that it was coming later this year, like many, many years ago.
[6830.52 → 6834.50] Yeah, they specifically, in 2019, um, or wait, where is it?
[6834.50 → 6839.30] In 2020, Musk claimed full self-driving would be featured complete by the end of the year.
[6839.38 → 6843.68] That was the first time that it was like within a year that he claimed it would happen.
[6843.68 → 6847.62] As far as my understanding goes, based on this timeline that I found, which might not be right.
[6847.76 → 6848.40] Someone else said it.
[6848.48 → 6849.08] I have to be careful.
[6850.36 → 6858.24] So in summary, um, I think that we're kind of missing, missing the forest for the trees here a little bit.
[6858.24 → 6865.10] The point of the test, uh, and like, man, people are getting so hung up on the I think it's the timing, right?
[6865.34 → 6865.68] The fake road.
[6865.98 → 6871.42] Uh, Robert was talking about how I, I think they were like planning this video from, from last year.
[6872.20 → 6881.58] Um, he's not, uh, apparently an investor in, in any company involved, um, and didn't get paid by that company with the LiDAR cars.
[6881.58 → 6887.22] They just provided one of the cars, and he's openly planning on like buying a new Tesla soon.
[6887.22 → 6890.02] Because he wants to like to upgrade the one that he has.
[6890.12 → 6891.76] He's like, I'm not a Tesla hater.
[6891.98 → 6893.14] I'm not against them.
[6893.20 → 6894.66] I'm going to buy another one.
[6894.74 → 6899.26] You're like targeting the wrong person, which I think is hilarious.
[6899.82 → 6900.22] Personally.
[6900.40 → 6907.52] I don't, I don't, I don't know about anybody else, but I think it's funny, but I think it's the, the timing with the stock going down, and the Tesla protests all happening right now.
[6907.52 → 6913.72] And a lot of people just not understanding even sort of at all that video production has like timelines.
[6913.72 → 6921.94] And this was definitely started a long time ago and was not planned to drop during like a Tesla stock on fire.
[6922.06 → 6927.28] Everyone lighting cars on fire, uh, anti-Nazi protests arc.
[6927.84 → 6930.10] You just, you just never know what's going to happen.
[6930.50 → 6931.68] The world's crazy.
[6931.98 → 6934.90] Casper Explorer asks, what happened to using both in conjunction?
[6934.90 → 6937.24] Good question.
[6937.86 → 6941.82] Tesla not only stopped shipping cars with LIDAR in them.
[6942.00 → 6949.98] They actually deactivated the LIDAR that is in any of their existing fleet of cars that do have LIDAR installed in them.
[6949.98 → 6956.20] And that was in the interest of building their full self-driving capabilities using only cameras.
[6956.32 → 6970.66] The really baffling to me, the really baffling thing to me is that, uh, and I actually didn't even realize this until I was reading up on this, is that Tesla not only relies just on cameras, but they don't even have stereoscopic vision with their cameras.
[6971.08 → 6973.66] Oh, I did not know that.
[6973.70 → 6976.42] And you guys correct me in the chat if I'm wrong, but that was something.
[6976.58 → 6977.18] That'd be too many cameras.
[6977.18 → 6978.92] Sorry, it wasn't a LIDAR, it was radar, wasn't it?
[6979.02 → 6980.50] We're gluing panels on around here.
[6980.54 → 6981.78] We can't, we can't double up the cameras.
[6981.78 → 6982.74] Hold on, they never had LIDAR.
[6982.82 → 6983.68] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[6983.82 → 6984.72] What did they have in?
[6984.84 → 6985.18] Radar?
[6986.44 → 6987.42] What did they disable?
[6989.40 → 6990.78] What did they...
[6990.78 → 6995.38] Ultrasonic sensors?
[7000.68 → 7002.66] Tesla removed the ultrasonic sensors.
[7003.04 → 7004.06] Oh, sorry, guys.
[7004.32 → 7005.84] As part of its transition to camera-only driver assist.
[7005.90 → 7006.58] Ultrasonic, that's right.
[7006.58 → 7009.40] They didn't use LIDAR because LIDAR was really expensive back then.
[7009.98 → 7017.46] LIDAR costs have come down, though, and that's why other cars are coming equipped.
[7017.88 → 7021.34] Well, my LIDAR just detected Linus, who just lied.
[7021.86 → 7023.58] They do have a one-dimensional...
[7023.58 → 7028.86] Thanks, Dan.
[7028.86 → 7031.84] They do have a one-dimensional distance sensor.
[7032.36 → 7032.88] So there you go.
[7032.96 → 7036.70] I would have thought that they would want, like, stereo vision with the cameras, though.
[7037.00 → 7037.54] Too many cameras.
[7037.78 → 7039.26] Yeah, maybe, yeah, maybe too many.
[7039.32 → 7041.06] Like I said earlier, we're gluing on panels over here.
[7041.06 → 7041.98] We're not buying extra cameras.
[7042.08 → 7042.34] Look.
[7042.58 → 7043.26] It's not happening.
[7043.26 → 7043.86] Look.
[7045.98 → 7047.10] We can't afford fasteners, Steve.
[7047.10 → 7050.06] I am not claiming that I know how to build a self-driving car.
[7050.98 → 7052.50] But maybe you'd use a fastener?
[7052.70 → 7053.64] But that's the difference.
[7055.66 → 7056.44] That's the difference.
[7056.58 → 7058.64] I'm not claiming to build a self-driving car.
[7058.64 → 7076.66] And the point of Mark's test was simply to show that there are limitations in a camera-only system that are going to be not just difficult, but impossible to overcome by not having anything else backing it up.
[7076.66 → 7084.28] And I think we've really seen that, especially under, you know, real-world challenging conditions different from what he tested.
[7084.28 → 7090.60] Like up here in Canada, snow is a major factor in the functionality of any kind of camera system.
[7090.74 → 7101.00] I mean, on my car, regularly, I will turn on my car, and I'll get, like, a notification that some of my driving assist features don't work because the cameras are, like, caked in snow.
[7101.58 → 7109.02] And, like, yeah, sure, theoretically, you should go out and do, like, a pre-flight check before you ever operate a vehicle.
[7109.50 → 7113.56] That is literally on your exam.
[7113.56 → 7113.90] Yep.
[7114.28 → 7115.32] When you get your driver's license.
[7115.32 → 7116.42] If you don't do it, they fail you.
[7116.54 → 7119.72] You are actually supposed to do a walk around the vehicle.
[7120.22 → 7123.42] And I have never once seen someone do it outside the exam.
[7123.54 → 7124.64] Not even once.
[7126.38 → 7127.42] Nerd's like, what?
[7127.70 → 7131.32] Yeah, it's literally, it is a very serious part of our exam up here.
[7131.40 → 7132.94] If you don't do it, you definitely will fail.
[7133.04 → 7135.44] And I genuinely have never seen that happen.
[7135.64 → 7136.08] Jake does.
[7136.08 → 7140.22] I watched Jake leave the building literally yesterday, and he did not.
[7140.42 → 7140.52] No.
[7140.60 → 7141.30] I don't believe you.
[7141.30 → 7141.98] There's no way.
[7141.98 → 7142.24] I don't believe you.
[7142.24 → 7142.80] It's a very serious part of our exam.
[7142.80 → 7143.02] You know...
[7143.02 → 7143.68] Yeah.
[7146.02 → 7148.40] So, yeah.
[7148.80 → 7149.62] Do you have coffee?
[7150.02 → 7154.64] So, the point is, theoretically, I should go around my vehicle and I should have a little,
[7154.72 → 7157.72] I should have a little brush and I should sweep off all my little cameras and everything.
[7157.82 → 7157.94] Yeah.
[7157.94 → 7163.08] but there are also situations where there's a bunch of slush on the road or a bunch of salt
[7163.08 → 7166.64] or there's a bunch of snow coming down recover while you're driving where it can get covered
[7166.64 → 7174.42] while you're driving, and it's just very obvious that a camera pointed in a particular direction
[7174.42 → 7179.48] can be covered oh well good luck everybody
[7179.48 → 7190.04] Linus admitting on camera that he doesn't do the legally required pre-drive check that everyone
[7190.04 → 7192.26] else definitely do I don't come get me
[7192.26 → 7201.70] let's go on your drive over don't forget to walk around your car you definitely won't do
[7201.70 → 7209.08] uh max o drive says kyle Paul did a video that shows that hardware three on older
[7209.08 → 7214.54] software on full self-driving fails but hardware four on current software it does see the wall and
[7214.54 → 7220.76] stops uh what was the can you remind me what was the generation of hardware that uh Mr musk said
[7220.76 → 7226.00] would be capable of full self-driving again what was it can you let me uh i have to find that
[7226.00 → 7233.32] again what was the one trying to remember trying to remember what it was what was it four
[7233.32 → 7238.92] I think it was four it was four right I think it was like two noes it was three it was three
[7238.92 → 7242.38] it was three um uh
[7242.38 → 7249.48] again I'm reading this off something else so I don't know but Elon Musk and this is a quote
[7249.48 → 7256.68] this is a quote I didn't say this is a quote okay Elon Musk initially stated that tesla's hardware 2.0
[7256.68 → 7263.32] or hw2 also known as ap2 was capable of level 5 autonomy paving the way for full self-driving capabilities
[7263.32 → 7269.56] that's an AI overview though I didn't say it you should ask rock you should ask I didn't quote it
[7269.56 → 7277.24] you should ask the uh the uncensored AI sure that's actually pretty funny you should ask grok I'm I'm i
[7277.24 → 7283.64] don't know how to do that but I'm going right now oh lord you'll have to sign in to twitter yeah yikes
[7283.64 → 7288.56] yeah uh what are we supposed to be doing right now Dan oh I'll do my favourite one is when people ask
[7288.56 → 7293.04] grok who spreads the most misinformation on Twitter, and it says Elon have you seen that
[7293.04 → 7299.52] no it consistently says Elon that's actually hilarious um I mean you can't say it's censored then

[7470.48 → 7478.64] off a truly unique ring all right Luke what did grok have to say all right well first off
[7482.00 → 7489.20] hardware two okay grok agrees yep this was announced in october 2016 when tesla stated that all cars
[7489.20 → 7492.48] produced from that point forward would be equipped with the necessary hardware for full autonomy including
[7492.48 → 7500.16] eight cameras radar and ultrasonic sensors paired with an NVIDIA computer okay, so this is pre the Jim Keller
[7500.72 → 7503.92] version of hard of the hardware because which one did Jim Keller work on
[7508.64 → 7512.96] uh but did he do hardware three
[7515.44 → 7516.96] we're going we're going we're cooking
[7518.24 → 7525.68] all right three yeah okay and that's the one that um wait for it no for real this time definitely
[7525.68 → 7531.04] would definitely be capable of self-driving with full redundancy, but now it turns
[7531.04 → 7535.28] out they're actually using all the redundancy just to like to run it at the level that it's running at
[7535.28 → 7542.40] now in its defence it's coming to this conclusion by looking it up it seems yeah I didn't actually know
[7542.40 → 7547.68] that part so it's coming to that conclusion by like looking up websites which I mean I'm sure people
[7547.68 → 7552.00] say that I think it would be very hard to define who actually spreads the most information on a
[7552.00 → 7558.08] particular website but if it's just like effectively googling it then people are going to say Elon all
[7558.08 → 7562.96] the time so it makes sense that it comes up with that I just thought it was funny but I didn't realize
[7562.96 → 7568.00] it was just search engine stuff speaking of being potentially um
[7571.84 → 7576.40] minus American cheese is cheese well then it should taste like cheese
[7578.64 → 7589.52] boom roasted absolutely destroyed um, so this is interesting i we don't have this topic prepped i
[7589.52 → 7594.56] think do we have anything on section 230 as far as I know it's an it's a mixture of cheeses
[7596.16 → 7602.48] section 230 what yeah uh so that's the whole thing where you're like not liable for the content on your
[7602.48 → 7612.72] site um which is a huge part of you know why uh user provided or user generated content at all like
[7612.72 → 7619.44] exists yeah um so it's an amendment of the communications act of 1934 I'm just looking at apple
[7619.44 → 7625.44] insiders article about it crucially says that no provider or user of an interactive computer
[7625.44 → 7629.92] service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of the information provided by another
[7629.92 → 7635.76] information content provider which basically means that user generated content um can't open you up to
[7635.76 → 7639.20] legal liability um
[7639.20 → 7649.60] uh lawmakers are sort of seeking to kill off section 230 which is kind of uh kind of scary
[7650.32 → 7656.32] there's support from both sides apparently from both democrats and republicans um
[7658.32 → 7662.08] maybe they just want to force the tech industry into negotiations either way I just thought that was
[7662.08 → 7666.32] kind of interesting because we were talking about the spread of misinformation on a site can you imagine
[7666.32 → 7673.20] if x inc or whatever the company is called was liable for the information that people post on
[7673.20 → 7677.44] the site you would just you would completely GC sites would be gone like we would shut down the
[7677.44 → 7682.00] forum immediately that's the reason that I brought it up because that was the first comment on Reddit
[7682.00 → 7687.44] under this was like anything with a comment section would either remove itself from the internet or
[7688.48 → 7695.76] remove their comment sections yeah the op asked what would happen to the Linus tech tips' forum if section 230 went
[7695.76 → 7702.80] away we would immediately delete it yeah or not allow it to be opened in America oh yeah that's
[7702.80 → 7707.60] an option too I guess we could just close it to Americans, and they could have the VPN experience that the
[7707.60 → 7714.56] rest of the world gets to enjoy yeah that was it that was all I want I just wanted to answer i just
[7714.56 → 7719.52] wanted to answer the op's uh the op's question here about what would happen to the forum it would be gone
[7719.52 → 7726.16] for you yeah and comments on YouTube would absolutely disappear which well YouTube would disappear
[7727.68 → 7736.80] oh yeah man unless they had like an approval team at YouTube and like a very small pool of creators
[7736.80 → 7741.44] that were allowed to upload content at all and all the content on the entire channel had to be vetted
[7741.44 → 7747.92] or sorry entire platform had to be vetted and manually i I doubt they would allow an automated
[7747.92 → 7755.92] system to do it no there's no way especially when liability comes into it um yeah yeah effectively
[7755.92 → 7761.04] like the vast majority of the modern web that is known and used today would die so you know
[7761.04 → 7764.72] maybe they should get rid of it sheaf 2k says no YouTube comments can we do this today
[7764.72 → 7772.80] um okay people really want us to talk about the Plex thing all right I mean we have the notes Plex is
[7772.80 → 7780.72] under fire I'm I'm here's the question though Luke you were too early when we dropped Plex as a sponsor
[7782.16 → 7787.28] why didn't we warn anybody that's true that's true that's true you could have we could have you
[7787.28 → 7792.56] could have we could have warned them you're a jerk um yeah I know just be a big mean guy so we did drop
[7792.56 → 7798.72] Plex as a sponsor a year ago two years ago something like that I still use the product
[7798.72 → 7803.60] I think your timeline dilated again you think so I think it's a lot longer than that oh I could be
[7803.60 → 7808.24] wrong but I think it's a lot longer than that when's the last time Plex sponsored something I don't think
[7808.24 → 7811.68] it was 10 years ago no, no I don't think it was that long no someone does when we chat said 10 years
[7811.68 → 7817.60] ago I don't think it was that hold on uh I don't know just do my usual thing Linus Plex
[7817.60 → 7824.08] three ways to start your own Plex server yeah I think they sponsored this yeah Plex are sponsoring
[7824.08 → 7829.76] this week learn more at Plex pro week no I'm good well okay September 2022 I'd say that's two and a
[7829.76 → 7834.00] half years ago that's two and a half years ago that's two I thought we dropped them along before
[7834.00 → 7840.40] then no so we only ever worked with them a couple of times but basically what I told them was I'm still
[7840.40 → 7845.52] going to use the product I'll still talk about the product but i I won't take a sponsorship this is
[7845.52 → 7850.00] because this is one of the ways that we can exert pressure on a brand is we'll basically go look
[7850.00 → 7856.16] we're not going to enter into any kind of partnership with you guys until xyz conditions have been met
[7856.16 → 7863.76] and I basically laid out like a wish list of features that was basically their list of features
[7863.76 → 7870.24] that were supposed to work and I said look when these work um then we'll talk then we'd love to
[7870.24 → 7876.08] work with you because i I do genuinely enjoy using the product um however it looks like I dodged a
[7876.08 → 7884.80] bullet here because they have since we worked with them and since we dropped them gone from um tolerated
[7884.80 → 7894.40] to I'm not tolerated uh as of April 29th 2025 Plex pass subscriptions are going up in cost this is the
[7894.40 → 7898.80] first time in over 10 years that pricing has increased so they at least do get some credit for that
[7898.80 → 7908.24] the current cost is 4.99 a month 40 a year and 120 lifetime the new costs are 6.99 a month
[7908.64 → 7918.72] 70 a year and 250 lifetimes I mean okay it's not the most insane jump considering they've never done
[7918.72 → 7924.88] it they're giving us warning you've got a month to buy a lifetime license for 120 before um before it
[7924.88 → 7933.36] goes up to 250 okay so far I'm not mad yet wait the price increase applies to new and current
[7933.36 → 7940.56] subscriptions this is pretty normal i know we're committing to not or whatever, but it's pretty
[7940.56 → 7947.52] normal I hate that i just I don't I understand you've said that we will raise the price on flow plane
[7947.52 → 7953.36] at some point yeah yeah would that not apply to new and current subscribers' no it would apply only
[7953.36 → 7958.16] to new subscribers' oh so we have to do another grandfather thing okay right I remember all right
[7958.16 → 7964.72] yeah because that wasn't the deal and I understand that from a contract law standpoint every new month
[7964.72 → 7971.92] every billing cycle is a new contract or whatever but for me, it's not really a question of
[7971.92 → 7977.92] whether it is legally allowed it's a question of whether it is right and no I don't think that's
[7977.92 → 7982.16] right if you sign up for a service for five dollars a month and the service doesn't materially change
[7982.16 → 7986.80] at least not for the better than you don't get to just unilaterally decide that now it's ten
[7986.80 → 7988.96] dollars a month I don't think it infinitely makes sense
[7992.40 → 8001.12] personally if you look at what five dollars was worth 20 years ago I don't know if it's fair to say like
[8001.12 → 8007.44] for until the heat death of the universe you cannot change the price well no but what you can
[8007.44 → 8014.72] do I mean you're going to have natural user attrition anyway like we have been unrealistically
[8014.72 → 8020.32] generous with the OGs for instance where we allow them oh yeah where we allow them to unsubscribe
[8020.32 → 8026.00] and then come back and then resubscribe at their original price that's actually unhinged and that's
[8026.00 → 8031.44] not something that I think we could sustain forever but you're going to have user attrition
[8031.44 → 8037.04] you're going to be constantly adding new users and so if you don't like the old rates then
[8038.72 → 8044.24] you just make new rates and over time you will transition everyone there yeah so needle saying like
[8044.24 → 8053.44] unhinged but based um yeah and I mean i i I think your policy on that is kind of nuts I also respect it and
[8053.44 → 8060.16] I'm totally down just to be clear but I also think like not every service can just literally never
[8060.16 → 8065.12] change the prices for a very significant portion of their user base um so that's that's just not
[8065.12 → 8070.32] going to work for everyone all the time in summary I'm honestly what do they actually even do it's all
[8070.32 → 8077.52] hosted and streamed by you isn't it uh well there is the lower quality version where it has the um
[8077.52 → 8081.68] like if you don't have your firewall configured properly or whatever I think they do relay some data
[8081.68 → 8086.96] in those cases all right um I forget what else they actually do that touches their servers I don't
[8086.96 → 8093.20] think it's much though unless you are streaming their freemium stuff glimmer d said i actually
[8093.20 → 8097.12] tried to change from the OG three dollar tier to the five dollar tier on purpose, and it wouldn't let me
[8098.40 → 8098.96] get owned
[8102.72 → 8103.84] I will not fix that
[8103.84 → 8114.24] you have to pay three dollars okay you're not allowed, but this is a long paragraph band or this
[8114.24 → 8118.08] is a long uh this is a long topic so I'm sure we're going to get to some stuff that we're mad about
[8118.08 → 8122.16] overall I'm not that mad about this it's no different from any of the rest of the industry
[8122.16 → 8127.20] and the fact that they're only finally increasing their pricing now honestly pretty, pretty cool all
[8127.20 → 8134.64] right the exception is lifetime Plex pass holders um if you have a lifetime Plex pass then your
[8134.64 → 8140.80] prices don't go up, and you can still obtain that until April 29th however there are a few other
[8140.80 → 8150.24] changes coming with the price hikes remote playback for personal media for free is going away no way
[8150.24 → 8157.28] okay are they hold on a second are they talking like with their relay or are they talking at all
[8157.92 → 8163.20] because if it's my bandwidth how could you possibly tell me that you need to charge me for it well
[8163.20 → 8169.68] okay but what is this saying like if the server slashes library you have access to does not have a Plex
[8169.68 → 8177.28] pass subscription you can pay for remote playback sorry what doesn't that make sense though
[8177.28 → 8185.68] does not have a Plex pass subscription hold on a second what I don't know how the monetization
[8185.68 → 8190.80] for Plex works so I don't really know there's oh there's free Plex I didn't even know that that's
[8190.80 → 8197.84] what I meant I thought there was only free Plex if it was ad supported okay I don't know how it works
[8197.84 → 8203.68] I'm on free Plex okay you can't like Chromecast from your phone, but you can also like Chromecast from
[8203.68 → 8209.60] your phone there are a few features that are locked behind it, but you know I have remote playback um
[8209.60 → 8214.24] I set up my IP configuration incorrectly so when I want to watch it in the living room I have to
[8214.24 → 8221.92] technically do remote playback um I don't know so what I would have to do is I have to get a Plex pack
[8221.92 → 8228.56] subscription for my Plex server and then I could, you know let my parents watch it or watch it from the
[8228.56 → 8233.36] living room that sort of thing right of course you would never let your parents watch media that uh
[8234.08 → 8238.72] they didn't physically know I mean like in my living room hold yeah they would come there
[8238.72 → 8243.04] although it's technically that a rebroadcasting license I have done none of these things yeah i
[8243.04 → 8247.92] don't know what you're talking just theoretical theoretically, theoretically yeah in minecraft yeah
[8248.56 → 8256.24] Redstone Plex server um okay so I can see why people are kind of mad about that
[8256.24 → 8268.64] oh am I about to hot take something again let's go we need more than the stream we only had like five
[8268.64 → 8277.76] or something I mean we need more Plex pump it up Plex can be a broken shitty product sometimes like i
[8277.76 → 8285.12] recently tried to use the download feature again, and it's like still is broken um but like if you want a
[8285.12 → 8294.96] free version of Plex then use Jellyfin and if you don't want the free version like if you don't want
[8294.96 → 8301.36] to jump through those hoops then um i I don't I don't know that they're actually asking an entirely
[8301.36 → 8308.48] unreasonable amount of money for what Plex does especially if you snag a lifetime Plex pass subscription
[8308.48 → 8316.24] now um so Jellyfin doesn't have like apps and things Plex is nice because it's got apps and
[8316.24 → 8322.64] sure then pay for it yeah like it's kind of the like it's not like this isn't food it's not shelter
[8323.36 → 8331.04] um it's not clean drinking water this is a luxury product that realistically if let's let's be
[8331.04 → 8337.12] real talk right now that realistically for a lifetime pass if you were actually paying for your media
[8338.48 → 8348.32] would be covered in like six movies which you are of course you definitely are we all everyone is um
[8349.52 → 8351.04] everybody so just like
[8352.96 → 8359.60] okay uh okay maybe there's going to be some more stuff that like gets me but I don't think I don't think this
[8359.60 → 8368.24] gets me yet Plex thinking you should pay for their software um especially because I suspect an
[8368.24 → 8376.08] enterprising smart individual will find a way to just hit a local target and then like VLC into that
[8376.08 → 8380.16] remotely anyway like this just seems like the kind of thing where if you're clever enough you could
[8380.16 → 8385.60] probably work around it absolutely um and like that's the thing is you're effectively in a variety
[8385.60 → 8391.20] of ways you're paying yourself not paying for Plex to do your workaround, or you could just pay them
[8391.20 → 8398.08] to not do it like that's that's the whole do you do a video on that no I don't think so not that
[8398.08 → 8402.00] interesting yeah I just don't think it's that interesting I think it's pretty niche yeah um okay
[8402.00 → 8408.64] all right let's let's seen if the next thing's going to get me remote playback with an okay hold on uh
[8408.64 → 8413.52] remote play for free is going away uh if you so is you have a Plex pass for your server you and anyone
[8413.52 → 8420.80] with access to that server can stream remotely okay or remote playback with a remote watch pass
[8420.80 → 8426.40] subscription whatever that is if the server slashes library that you have access to does not have a
[8426.40 → 8435.44] Plex pass subscription you can pay for remote playback for yourself it is a dollar 99 a month or 20
[8435.44 → 8446.24] annual this seems kind of terrifying from a like a legal liability standpoint why would Plex want
[8447.44 → 8455.52] anyone paying them money for access to pirate media servers uh totally paid for content storage
[8455.52 → 8463.04] yeah but no but actually real talk for a second yeah I know I hear you um that seems completely
[8464.24 → 8471.28] crazy and I don't use that word lightly can they still play ignorance like they don't know what's
[8471.28 → 8478.24] going through it right I mean you're just unlocking a feature I don't think it's particularly encrypted in
[8478.24 → 8485.20] any way the only reason that that was as long as they don't log it I still think they could feign ignorance
[8487.28 → 8492.56] I think Plex gets metadata yeah they do know they 100 know what's being played
[8493.60 → 8499.20] so I've been wondering honestly for a very long time how Plex hasn't gotten owned it has made no sense to
[8499.20 → 8505.20] me for a very, very long time yeah but again the whole metadata thing you explained the metadata thing to
[8505.20 → 8511.36] me years ago but if they're relaying it is this actually relay though I don't think it says relay
[8511.36 → 8516.56] well if the person so here's a hypothetical scenario guys correct me if I'm wrong here but what
[8516.56 → 8524.40] it sounds like to me is if this is my Plex server and I do not own a Plex pass because I just use it at
[8524.40 → 8531.76] home and I don't care or I have my Jacky set up you know to remotely access it or whatever right okay I'm
[8531.76 → 8538.16] using parsec on my phone or honestly a wild range of other services any number of different things
[8538.16 → 8543.68] okay, so this is my this is my Plex server I don't pay for Plex pass because I don't want to give
[8543.68 → 8549.36] anybody any money but I also don't want to set up Jellyfin for whatever reason okay you that's your
[8549.36 → 8555.44] computer that's Luke's computer yeah beautiful lovely computer the right colour lttstore.com um
[8555.44 → 8563.60] um you want to access my server remotely but I've told you that um if you want me to set up you know
[8563.60 → 8570.08] my Jacky solution uh then you're responsible for keeping it working because you I'm not going to fix it
[8570.08 → 8575.12] for you every week sure, and you say oh actually that sounds like a lot of work but i definitely
[8575.12 → 8582.64] want to access your high quality Blu-ray rips um so I'm going to buy this two dollar a month uh
[8582.64 → 8586.48] uh what remote watch what's it called remote watch pass
[8588.72 → 8595.44] on what planet okay right right right let's say that as part of my even though I can set up my
[8595.44 → 8599.84] Jacky remote watch system for myself i for whatever reason can't configure port forwarding
[8599.84 → 8605.12] or I don't want to I don't want to open a port and I'm not going to go set up tail scale or whatever
[8605.12 → 8607.36] so I effectively have my firewall up
[8607.36 → 8618.48] if you access it wouldn't that go through Plex's relay which they know because of the metadata of
[8618.48 → 8623.60] the file including the file name like that's in plexus store but are they're storing it though
[8623.60 → 8631.04] no they're not storing it they're just relaying it yeah so they could have a government
[8631.04 → 8636.32] agency get them to start sniffing it but if they're not storing like this is the whole thing
[8636.32 → 8642.96] with VPNs right no logs sure if they don't store it if they're not logging it risen from whatever says
[8642.96 → 8651.76] Plex does not man in the middle of the content um is that true I have no idea I don't I know very
[8651.76 → 8658.88] because if it's not encrypted and there 's's no way that they would like encrypted if they didn't
[8658.88 → 8663.68] have to because it would just add burden on both sides and the only like my understanding was the
[8663.68 → 8670.72] only reason that it didn't have to be encrypted was because there's no one to kind of send a DMCA
[8671.52 → 8678.00] to right like if you if you download through your oh yeah I know your yeah I would go through
[8678.00 → 8683.92] your ISP or whatever yeah what does that stream look like it is an encrypted tunnel okay so
[8683.92 → 8690.08] it's an encrypted tunnel okay so then yeah maybe they can play dumb then okay, okay okay all right
[8691.60 → 8703.92] however I know for a fact that the Plex app does is capable of logging like act user
[8703.92 → 8712.48] actions and I know for a fact that the server is capable of logging can they really feign ignorance
[8712.48 → 8718.64] because I know Plex can get access to those logs although I'm trying to think because I have gotten
[8718.64 → 8724.40] support from them in the past, and they did I did have to send them stuff once we got past a certain
[8724.40 → 8730.56] level so is it possible that they are simply just simply not logging the metadata yeah I'm sure
[8731.76 → 8736.80] on purpose but are they going to have the same level of like plausible deniability
[8736.80 → 8744.08] when the user is effectively subscribing it literally is called remote watch pass
[8745.28 → 8750.00] they literally have a subscription to watch the content that is hosted on the Plex server
[8750.00 → 8757.92] no what if it's home videos they don't know Plex doesn't know they know, but they don't legally know
[8758.48 → 8762.72] as far as my understanding goes i I assume it has to be that way or else they would just be deleted
[8762.72 → 8768.72] oh risen from the ashes goes Plex absolutely has the metadata because they have the community
[8768.72 → 8772.00] friends feature that's tracking what you and your friends watch, and it even syncs between devices
[8772.00 → 8778.16] no they 100 have it they even have a Plex movie database that automatically identifies your home
[8778.16 → 8782.40] movies yeah every once in a while I have a very how do they still exist then this has been i I haven't
[8782.40 → 8791.04] understood this for so many years how is there a notably like sizeable company in this arena that has
[8791.04 → 8796.80] been able to survive Plex is also known for shutting down the yarn 80 Plex library subscription services
[8796.80 → 8801.68] that people kind of homebrew so this just seems like them like taking out the middleman
[8802.96 → 8810.80] and creating an environment where people can subscribe to dude how is that how is this a thing I don't know
[8811.44 → 8816.24] but I don't understand how it's been a thing forever so I don't know uh
[8816.24 → 8825.04] uh okay Plex has no way to know if you own it or not yeah but in many regions whether you own it or
[8825.04 → 8830.24] not it is irrelevant because you don't have a license to rebroadcast it so it doesn't matter
[8830.24 → 8836.64] you own a license to use that disc in your disc player and watch it for yourself that's all you
[8836.64 → 8841.92] own a license for or if you have one of those ultraviolet or UV or whatever that thing was the
[8841.92 → 8847.36] digital thing that like I think got shut down so people just like lost their anyway um that's all
[8847.36 → 8858.88] you own abort stop talking about if it's going to get nuked i uh this seems completely
[8858.88 → 8867.12] insane i i I don't I don't but to me, I mean with the friends' thing dad's talking about stuff like this
[8867.12 → 8873.52] has seemed insane for so many years it's always been insane i I don't know I don't understand I've
[8873.52 → 8879.68] never understood how they exist I well they didn't host anything, but they know stuff, but they didn't
[8879.68 → 8886.88] host it, but it's Napster knew stuff and Napster got obliterated no, no hold on no, no didn't Napster did
[8886.88 → 8893.04] Napster host I can't remember pirate bay used to host and now basically all they do is magnet links
[8893.04 → 8900.00] so they don't have anything but links right so okay what's the what's the Plex yeah don't
[8900.00 → 8910.16] go on the pirate bay uh so what's the Plex like analog for that they their app man I'm trying to wrap
[8910.16 → 8916.48] my brain around how they could possibly defend this because I know for a fact that part of their metadata
[8916.48 → 8924.96] includes like the actual file name right like it's, and it'll have stuff like uh I'm trying
[8924.96 → 8929.44] to think of like uh but is that is this a service that's running on your end that's like
[8929.44 → 8936.48] looking up IMDB and comparing it against your file name and then yeah making small changes, but it's not
[8936.48 → 8941.52] phoning back home to Plex because that could absolutely be a thing this is what I assumed it was I know the UI
[8941.52 → 8949.84] shows the original file name in Plex yeah so it could be yeah they offer a service to match the
[8950.72 → 8957.76] identified video with a real title happening on your side oh they also tap into like some IMDB API
[8957.76 → 8963.92] or something it also might just download occasionally, and it's just like a reference locally as you say
[8963.92 → 8969.84] if no and if you configure it they absolutely do uh video analysis of the video itself because they can
[8969.84 → 8974.64] that's how they do their intro skip feature but is that happening locally yeah that would be
[8974.64 → 8980.40] happening locally yeah so as long as it's not phoning home they probably don't care this is the
[8980.40 → 8984.72] point that I'm saying is on a surface level it makes no sense about this what if someone has to
[8984.72 → 8990.72] not log what if someone had on their Plex server a file that has simply never existed outside a
[8990.72 → 8995.68] streaming platform then there'd be no there'd be no plausible deniability the fact that it has a
[8995.68 → 9002.80] metadata match for it at all means, but they're they don't have to log it, but they do though they
[9002.80 → 9008.80] know that they know that you and your friend accessed it because they know that you
[9008.80 → 9013.60] access that content that would have no legal way of existing there so where do they know that again i
[9013.60 → 9019.04] don't use this so where how do you so like every once in a while I will fire up something that my now
[9019.04 → 9027.44] deceased sister watched, and it'll be like activity from Emma um and that was synced to me via the cloud
[9029.60 → 9035.04] because her account is friends with my account and we both watch that content on my server if they have
[9035.04 → 9041.36] some interesting way where they've done this where like your information is stored on your device
[9041.36 → 9050.16] and it gets like shared over but in a way that Plex doesn't store it like is it super live like
[9050.16 → 9055.92] is it that I don't know yeah I mean they used to have watch together I wonder if that's why watch
[9055.92 → 9061.36] together is going away maybe i I don't know that for sure even watch together I can think of ways that
[9061.36 → 9066.96] you could dev it where it doesn't have to share anything other than uh raw information about like
[9066.96 → 9072.48] time code in the video and stuff like that like it wouldn't have to actually share the video um
[9073.04 → 9076.88] because like a lot of watch together services that used to work through YouTube and stuff
[9076.88 → 9083.76] they're not like they're not man in the middle on youtube they're just syncing up your time code
[9083.76 → 9090.72] and stuff like it's um there are other ways to do these things um they just have to really
[9090.72 → 9098.72] go out of their way to do them but i I mean i it is still stunning to me that despite all of that
[9098.72 → 9102.80] Plex has been able to get away with these things like I'm my opinion on that's never going to change
[9102.80 → 9108.00] but i I do think there are ways for them to not log any of this information there's a way around it
[9108.00 → 9112.32] it might not be the most efficient might not be the easiest etc, but it's possible for them to do it
[9112.32 → 9119.52] people are asking is it p2p yes, yes generally it is um other than when um port forwarding isn't
[9119.52 → 9125.12] configured correctly then it seems like they set up some kind of encrypted tunnel um that would have
[9125.12 → 9132.32] to go through them in some way um let's see hold on there was someone else that had a that had a good
[9132.32 → 9137.28] comment uh Steve says how do they send these monthly emails showing what my friends are watching though
[9137.28 → 9149.76] hold on we're not actually done, yet they are removing the mobile unlock fee I don't know man
[9150.32 → 9156.56] playing content on a local network on the new mobile app will be free okay so that's cool public
[9156.56 → 9163.04] release coming early 2025 they're also revising their terms of service and privacy policy uh mostly
[9163.04 → 9167.68] legal boilerplate miscellaneous typo grammar fixes and an explainer for how Plex treats universal opt-out
[9167.68 → 9174.64] mechanisms, but it seems like they will be selling user data mostly focused around advertising updated
[9174.64 → 9180.24] who does Plex share or sell personal data with to include the Plex activity that you share based on
[9180.24 → 9184.40] your account visibility and activity settings as well as sharing slash sale of certain personal data to
[9184.40 → 9190.80] third parties they claim multiple times that they will not be collecting or selling content data yeah
[9190.80 → 9195.44] there's a point in their TOS here we do not and will not collect information about content or
[9195.44 → 9202.16] titles in your personal media library of or what you've played yeah they have to not so when those
[9202.16 → 9207.20] emails go out like are those being generated by you, I have no idea it might be coming from the
[9207.20 → 9213.04] Plex server but I don't have a relay set up for that the second point after that is personal media users
[9213.04 → 9218.32] we do not in all capitals and will not share or sell any information about the content and titles
[9218.32 → 9227.04] on or your use of a personal media server oh little jd97 says um all they would need to do is run a
[9227.04 → 9232.32] stun service to help connect users peer-to-peer in that case no content goes through them, it's not a tunnel okay
[9233.52 → 9233.84] um
[9233.84 → 9252.00] man I mean good luck Plex um honestly other than the selling of user data you know rug pull super not
[9252.00 → 9258.24] impressed with that I don't know if any of the other stuff seems that egregious to me in the grand scheme
[9258.24 → 9267.04] of things especially now that free um open source options are so much more mature than they used to
[9267.04 → 9275.12] be I could see people being furious back when the options were like air video and this uh i
[9275.12 → 9280.96] could see people being really upset about it as it is now at least if you are upset about it, you absolutely
[9280.96 → 9286.48] have valid options that you can jump to so I would say that would be the way to show Plex your
[9286.48 → 9292.80] dissatisfaction is to vote with your wallet um or if you are committed to Plex, and you don't want
[9292.80 → 9297.36] to learn to use anything else I'd say now is a good time to pick up the lifetime Plex pass because
[9297.36 → 9305.44] the new subscription rates are not great not going to lie and i I do think that the value is still there
[9305.44 → 9315.28] even if their functionality is pretty broken um a lot of the time like I think I talked um I think i
[9315.28 → 9320.64] talked last week about how I tried to prep some episodes of a show and I tried to download
[9320.64 → 9326.08] a whole season and like one or two of the episodes failed and there was no way to retry just those
[9326.08 → 9331.44] episodes I had to delete everything I had already downloaded and then re-attempt it and then that
[9331.44 → 9335.44] re-attempt completely failed it's like okay great all right
[9335.44 → 9343.12] what are we doing I don't know what topic was this
[9350.24 → 9360.96] okay um we can talk about this sure the new god of war TV series showrunner says he's not a gamer Amazon
[9360.96 → 9366.08] is investing in two seasons of a new god of war show it was greenlet in 2022 and the plot is based
[9366.08 → 9372.48] on the 2018 game original writers brought in to kickstart the writing process left in 2024 always
[9372.48 → 9378.88] a good sing uh Ron Moore is the new showrunner, and he has a lot of good experience IMDB examples
[9378.88 → 9386.48] include producer on 77 episodes of Star Trek the next generation from 1991 to 1994 producer showrunner
[9386.48 → 9392.96] on 74 episodes of battle star galactic from 2004 to 2009 executive producer and producer on 85 episodes
[9392.96 → 9400.72] of outlander 2014 to 2024, but he has admitted to not playing anything since the arcade days fans are
[9400.72 → 9405.52] upset and worried that he will ruin it by not respecting the source material he hasn't said
[9405.52 → 9412.56] anything about how faithful the adaptation will be um a lot of recent adaptations have not respected the
[9412.56 → 9418.00] source material a couple of examples we have here been the wheel of time the Witcher the rings of power
[9418.00 → 9424.56] and halo I didn't even give the rings of power the time of day the Witcher stuff pissed me off the
[9424.56 → 9431.52] wheel of time stuff pissed me off and the halo stuff just straight up enraged me I knew it I knew the word
[9431.52 → 9439.04] I knew the word that was coming that was quite the call actually I knew it there was no way he was
[9439.04 → 9448.32] going to use any word other than that that was kind of nuts uh it's true though yeah anyway um now
[9448.32 → 9455.52] maybe this was maybe this was uh misreporting it's not in our notes but I saw something that said that
[9455.52 → 9466.00] he was instructed by the big wigs to not play the game oh is that true guys please let me
[9466.00 → 9470.64] know because i I saw that he mentioned that he like tried to play it a little bit, but like ran into
[9470.64 → 9476.72] some quick time events and found it kind of hard um I also like I think you said this but i I agree
[9476.72 → 9481.12] with it where it's like if he's you know if he's not really a gamer I don't think that's actually a
[9481.12 → 9487.12] problem but watching like a lets play or something like that I think would be fine um
[9487.12 → 9496.32] um yeah uh no apparently he tried the game and gave up says Steve um
[9498.32 → 9504.40] which is fine I think which is fine I would say that as long as you need to absorb the material
[9504.40 → 9510.16] somehow yeah as long as you go on twitch or YouTube and watch a lets play or something like that I don't
[9510.16 → 9516.24] care if the director's a gamer but I do care that the director understands what it is so they can
[9516.24 → 9524.40] represent it properly like it is respectfully it enrages me when the whole reason that you paid
[9524.40 → 9531.04] for IP right is that people love the source material, and then you just go like throw it in the garbage
[9532.24 → 9538.16] now that doesn't mean that there's only like one right way to do this I mean we've absolutely seen
[9538.16 → 9548.64] we have absolutely seen fan show runners uh just completely destroy franchises we've seen oh
[9548.64 → 9556.88] Riley points out that um non-fans can make like top franchise entries like uh tony Gilroy with Landor
[9556.88 → 9566.08] for Star Wars um I also have a personal favourite example of a company in this case DreamWorks paying to
[9566.08 → 9572.96] license an IP completely changing functionally everything and it being awesome how to train your
[9572.96 → 9580.56] dragon is legitimately if not my favourite movie of all time one of my favourite movies of all time it is
[9581.12 → 9587.92] nothing like the books, and it definitely struggles the film series does struggle as time goes on to
[9587.92 → 9594.64] continue to develop the story uh whereas the books stay strong throughout the entire thing yeah i one of
[9594.64 → 9600.16] my examples and i I read this I don't know a ton about it, I haven't watched the show but i I read this
[9600.16 → 9608.64] um invincible apparently they have the writer working on the show, but the show does not match the comics
[9610.08 → 9617.04] and the writer like seems to be doing this on purpose and the purpose seems to be like I can do this better
[9617.04 → 9623.76] oh because people are like very happy with the show okay um, and it seems to be just like I got a second
[9623.76 → 9630.40] shot at this I can like to fix some things basically so it's like not respecting the source material but
[9630.40 → 9639.60] it's being done by the writer so I don't know, and it seems to be better so do backs and random yeah song
[9639.60 → 9646.00] numbers no but better right yeah did you know that in how to train your dragon books toothless is like
[9646.00 → 9655.92] pocket-sized no I have no idea yeah that's a pretty dramatic change oh dude no it's completely different
[9656.80 → 9664.16] um what's her name the love interest astrid doesn't exist oh that's weird she's a good
[9664.16 → 9670.40] part of the show yep oh yeah no like 100 um by the way apparently he officially said that he's a better writer
[9670.40 → 9676.40] now so he's making changes there you go to the show dragons um they're not like at war with dragons
[9676.40 → 9681.84] at the start of the books huh they just like dragons are just like integrated into their life
[9682.72 → 9689.52] like every kid has a dragon like wow they are I don't even know why they bothered to license the IP
[9689.52 → 9695.36] just because they could have changed the names hiccup and toothless and like a handful of other
[9695.36 → 9700.56] character names and just like made a show about, and it would have been fine yeah and i I really don't
[9700.56 → 9705.60] think they would have been nailed on if it is like they are nothing alike respecting the source material
[9705.60 → 9711.68] doesn't mean matching it yeah that's fair I think people interpreted it that way but I think you're also
[9711.68 → 9717.60] right I think that's fair yeah I think that I think that's fair yeah Lindy says they bought a fan base
[9717.60 → 9722.48] I don't know yeah I guess I'd never heard of the books I mean neither I don't think the fan base was
[9722.48 → 9731.12] enormous movies, and it's DreamWorks they're going to get viewers yeah i hmm interesting I don't know either
[9731.12 → 9742.56] way that uh yeah it's like my favourite movie um moving on yeah good luck Amazon Microsoft posts then
[9742.56 → 9748.80] removes an image of the Xbox UI with steam games included earlier this year Microsoft talked about
[9748.80 → 9755.68] combining the best of Xbox and windows and this week they briefly showed what looked like it might be
[9755.68 → 9763.52] that Microsoft posted an image of new Xbox UI on multiple devices that included a steam button but then
[9763.52 → 9768.88] pulled the image down when the verge asked about it and Xbox chief Phil spencer has previously hinted that
[9768.88 → 9777.68] pc stores like epic games and itch.io could one day appear on Xbox consoles interesting now you just
[9777.68 → 9785.60] need to make the Xbox store on pc not horrible that would be pretty cool I would appreciate that okay
[9786.16 → 9792.08] all that's kind of all I have to say about that neat uh ROK confirms experiment showing an ad before
[9792.08 → 9798.96] the home screen on sunday, March 16th ROK users noticed ads being played on startup before being
[9798.96 → 9804.24] taken to the home screen complaints started popping up on the forum this occurred on both ROK TVs and
[9804.24 → 9811.36] streaming sticks and multiple users reported seeing an ad for uh Mona 2. a ROK spokesperson shared a
[9811.36 → 9816.56] company statement confirming that this is expected behaviour but not a permanent part of the ROK OS
[9816.56 → 9823.68] currently they claim they were just trying the ad capability out ROK did not respond when asked to
[9823.68 → 9829.60] comment on the community backlash whether this would become a permanent feature which devices are affected
[9829.60 → 9836.32] or why they decided to use autoplaying ads we have an upcoming video on a dumb TV we found stay tuned
[9838.88 → 9844.80] ugh discussion question I know Linus hates ads if this happened on your beloved TCL would you get rid of it
[9844.80 → 9853.52] for another brand I don't know if I hate ads i um you don't see them yeah I can't really see them um
[9854.64 → 9862.00] ad blindness to be clear sometimes I do see them but I also will just like maybe part of it is
[9862.00 → 9866.64] just the add because I don't really have a problem you'll see an ad be uninterested and then just be
[9866.64 → 9873.04] thinking about something else yeah like I'll, I'll just like brain warp to something else for a little bit
[9873.04 → 9878.56] and then be peripherally aware that something's going on that is not to my interests and then I'll
[9879.76 → 9884.40] be back to it when like it depends how long it is if it was like a little port back if it was three
[9884.40 → 9889.36] seconds like if it was as long as the TCL splash screen which i no longer have to look at then i
[9889.36 → 9895.44] don't think it would really bother me but if is my TV tried to play like a 30-second ad every
[9895.44 → 9901.68] time I turned it on I think I would probably put my foot through it for real this time yeah um I would just
[9901.68 → 9910.64] stop having a TV I think sorry everyone this feels like a direction we have been going with TVs it
[9910.64 → 9916.08] feels like it's actively getting worse and like a lot worse sweet and hot sounds good I actually have
[9916.08 → 9919.44] no idea what the deal is with this other than that they're on set and I've been told that I'm allowed
[9919.44 → 9925.52] to eat them they're on set, and you're allowed to eat them is that the whole thing it seems like they
[9925.52 → 9930.40] got awfully prominent placement for just they're on set and I'm allowed to eat them is it like do
[9930.40 → 9935.60] we need to do we need to like to disclose anything here I would really dramatically prefer we were
[9935.60 → 9944.32] informed of these things but anyway um Windows update uninstalls copilot and users rejoice mandatory
[9944.32 → 9951.76] update I'm going to say the whole thing it's in the I'm going to say it kb505 uh 3598 released on March
[9951.76 → 9958.32] 11th has proven to be a major headache for Microsoft with Windows users reporting in installation feature
[9958.32 → 9966.24] failures RDP disconnects and even blue screens on Windows 11 24 h2 but to some users delight it's also
[9966.24 → 9973.36] removing copilot from some machines and even unwitting it from the taskbar also impacted are Windows 11 23 h2
[9973.36 → 9981.12] 22 h2 and even Windows 10 22 h2 and 21 h2 a Microsoft support document states that they're aware of
[9981.12 → 9986.64] the issue and working on a resolution the Windows 11 Subreddit seems to be pretty happy about the bug
[9986.64 → 9991.84] calling it the best update for Microsoft in a long time and praising Microsoft for fixing their own
[9991.84 → 10000.08] bloat Windows 10 is coming up on its like EOL oh yeah sure isn't that crazy yep and I think we're
[10000.08 → 10004.96] planning some content I think uh I was oh man I'm I'm going to forget what it was but I came across a
[10004.96 → 10010.40] headline recently that some game or something runs better on Windows 10 than Windows 11 like still after all
[10010.40 → 10018.80] all this time not surprised man i uh when we do our when we do our customary you know hey is it
[10019.52 → 10024.16] is it good that this is going away because we've kind of done that for Windows 7 Windows 8 we've kind
[10024.16 → 10032.56] of looked back on them Windows 11 is a bit of a rough ship Windows 10 really does seem like it was a high
[10032.56 → 10040.56] point hey like i I don't personally have day-to-day issues with Windows 11 personally it is doesn't
[10040.56 → 10045.28] I get in my way usability wise I don't mind it one of my problems is compatibility stuff
[10046.00 → 10054.24] um like the deprecation of Windows 10 will force some people to either have uh unsecured systems or
[10054.24 → 10063.76] buy a new computer and I think this is like the first time in a very long time that that's been
[10063.76 → 10074.64] true so that's rough um a lot of the world it's very hard to just buy a new computer um and Windows 10
[10074.64 → 10080.24] computers for the most part by that time can do the vast majority of things people need to do on computers
[10080.24 → 10087.92] can even play a lot of modern games okay just fine hear me out does this drive a Linux migration
[10087.92 → 10094.64] maybe genuinely like if steam OS capitalizes on this yeah yeah because they're planning on are
[10094.64 → 10098.48] they're they're still not out right not out yet, but they're planning on it, I mean it's already
[10099.44 → 10106.56] I believe the beta version now supports other handhelds I don't think we're we're fully at
[10106.56 → 10112.48] you know valve saying yep here's steam OS install it on your computer and plug your monitor in and
[10112.48 → 10118.08] just use it as a computer we're not there yet, but they've they've they've telegraphed that it's coming
[10118.08 → 10123.52] it's coming eventually the year of the Linux desktop might be the death of the death of Windows 10.
[10124.96 → 10130.00] the year of Windows desktop or sorry Linux desktop might not be brought in by Linux it might be brought
[10130.00 → 10139.20] in by Microsoft shooting themselves sure I mean yeah why not right it seems reasonable to me because
[10139.20 → 10144.56] like people are going to start getting crazy warnings on their systems that they have to upgrade to
[10144.56 → 10149.20] Windows 11, and then they'll check, and their system will say that they are not compatible, and they count
[10149.20 → 10154.48] on upgrade and a lot of people aren't going to want to buy a new computer because like again these
[10154.48 → 10162.80] things are fine if you do like basic photo editing basic video editing uh text stuff web browsing your
[10162.80 → 10168.72] computer back from Windows 10 era is for sure still okay are we going to end up with another XP situation
[10168.72 → 10173.28] where Microsoft kicks the can down the road because they realize that the users just aren't going to get
[10173.28 → 10178.56] on board with it and there's going to be a bunch of unsecured systems out there I mean there
[10178.56 → 10183.84] absolutely will be if they do this yeah they're at there 100 will be because people are
[10183.84 → 10190.40] not just going to replace working computers until they run into like they go to install chrome or they
[10190.40 → 10196.32] go to install steam like steam dropped support for Windows vista not that long ago so it's going to be
[10196.32 → 10202.56] a long time before just the applications you absolutely must use every day start not working
[10202.56 → 10207.76] on your Windows 10 system, but that will happen didn't we say the same thing for the Windows 7 to Windows 10
[10207.76 → 10213.92] deadline uh I don't think so we certainly didn't say anything about steam os didn't exist yet
[10213.92 → 10217.84] at that point and I mean there are a surprising amount of people still running Windows 7.
[10219.20 → 10221.60] so if that's what we were saying then yeah I mean it's still a thing
[10226.48 → 10232.96] that's wild dude um I'm I'm I mean I'm rooting for them, I'm rooting for I'm rooting for Linux I'm I'm not
[10232.96 → 10237.52] ready to daily it as long as just there's anti-sheet issues and compatibility issues and whatever else but
[10238.72 → 10247.04] I'm I'm so rooting for it, i it when steam OS is installable I want to try it, it is installable
[10247.04 → 10252.08] you can install it today on your desktop oh I didn't we did a video recently oh yeah tell me
[10252.08 → 10256.00] you don't watch LTT without telling me you don't watch i watch some of it okay yeah yeah i
[10256.00 → 10261.04] watched I know you do uh yeah jordan installed it, and you know what your system won't work
[10261.84 → 10267.68] you have to use a radio on GPU oh yeah so like no it's not it's not ready yet limitations yep the
[10267.68 → 10273.36] installer needs some work you uh it does not support installing with more than one drive in the system
[10273.36 → 10278.00] it just automatically wipes and because it's its like a's like a system restore image
[10278.56 → 10282.80] effectively it's for the steam deck very designed for the steam deck yes absolutely that makes sense
[10282.80 → 10289.04] so give it time give it time but I think it's going to happen uh we've got some we've got some more
[10289.04 → 10296.56] stuff oh big screen beyond 2 and 2e launch kind of a big deal i oh this has been killing me I've had
[10296.56 → 10304.48] mine for two weeks I have not touched it because I have been travelling I could have travelled virtually
[10304.48 → 10313.52] would you would do you do that on the plane oh no it's pc VR oh tether outside in yes sir
[10314.32 → 10321.60] I am very excited Adam was telling me about it today i am actually very stoked how much
[10321.60 → 10328.40] are they it brings an overhaul to the optics that increases the field of view from 102 to 116 degrees
[10328.40 → 10334.40] increases brightness increases the sweet spot reduces lens glare adds adjustable interpupillary
[10334.40 → 10340.56] distance using a little tool adds new headgear and a universal face gasket has clear and translucent
[10340.56 → 10348.00] orange colours and the 2e gets eye tracking it has translucent orange, and they somehow made it even
[10348.00 → 10354.16] lighter oh it does have translucent orange no way I mean glad I procrastinated on the first one it is down
[10354.16 → 10363.20] to 107 grams down from 127. Dude they made one for you so even nice look that really does look
[10363.20 → 10369.20] like compare that to your jacket if you get one uh it'll match your reversible bomber which you can
[10369.20 → 10375.44] get right now on lttstore.com look at Dan let's go look at him go even if you add the audio strap which
[10375.44 → 10382.40] which that picture I was showing you guys had the whole thing is just 272 grams that's just over half the
[10382.40 → 10388.24] weight of a quest 3. Adam has some usage impressions he says I only used it for roughly an hour so far
[10388.24 → 10394.32] but the improvements to the optics are massive improved for is awesome reduction in flare and
[10394.32 → 10399.12] chromatic aberration was notable even without a side-by-side comparison bummed about the lack
[10399.12 → 10404.96] of improvement to DisplayPort we're still stuck with 75 or 90 hertz with DSC but not sure if that's
[10404.96 → 10409.60] limitation of the USB standard haven't looked into anything at all yet so these are very preliminary
[10410.40 → 10414.56] and it seems that these new features have made many enthusiasts pull out their wallet because big
[10414.56 → 10419.68] screen says they've sold more of the beyond 2 in the first day than they did in the first six months
[10419.68 → 10427.36] with the original big screen apparently sent us some desk pads that they made using the oh
[10427.36 → 10443.12] yeah yeah I wanted it so bad
[10447.12 → 10451.84] this is the scan for the custom fit gasket which does still exist even though they have a universal one now
[10451.84 → 10459.12] oh my goodness i kind of want one of these incredible I want one too they should sell that
[10459.12 → 10464.64] on the store you should do a collaboration I meant the headset uh discussion question here is how stoked
[10464.64 → 10469.20] are you about this and are we going to do a video very stoked, and we're absolutely going to do a video
[10469.20 → 10476.64] both Adam and I will be playing with it and uh contributing to our review they sell it they sell a can that
[10476.64 → 10483.28] you can store it in, and it looks like a pop can that's pretty cool that's hilarious I mean I don't
[10483.28 → 10488.40] know why I like that so much yeah I don't know what I would use that for I mean it's like a tethered
[10488.40 → 10494.80] setup so unless it also holds my lighthouses well no I'm assuming so it like protects it because it's
[10494.80 → 10497.52] it's really light and somewhat fragile isn't it
[10497.52 → 10506.96] I mean anything with sensitive optics is going to be fragile at least to a degree so yeah I could
[10506.96 → 10512.80] I can understand someone wanting to use it as like a way to protect it all right what else we got uh you
[10512.80 → 10516.80] were really excited to talk about etc really oh
[10524.32 → 10526.80] I didn't go do you know that oh
[10528.08 → 10538.56] no I went to g DC which happens one hour away at the exact same time and nothing happened anything
[10538.56 → 10544.08] happened at all oh bummer uh well you shouldn't have done that then nothing was announced there
[10545.44 → 10546.64] nothing happened there
[10550.00 → 10555.36] I thought you went to etc we went to go to the actual GDC event not just the NVIDIA side thing
[10555.36 → 10560.48] uh we didn't even have the right badges the badge that we had didn't gain us access until after we
[10560.48 → 10566.08] flew away so we went to one thing and there was literally nothing there, and we went to oh but
[10566.08 → 10570.32] there's that side event we can go to we'll go check that out too and there was literally nothing there
[10570.32 → 10574.96] either I was talking to Wendell the whole time I was like hey I'll do you want to meet up sometime and
[10574.96 → 10580.24] he's like yeah I'm like going here I was like cool that's not where I am
[10580.24 → 10590.56] and then i I was like oh we must be here because you know there's nothing happening on down there and
[10590.56 → 10595.12] they were like oh yeah it's just enterprise stuff, and then they launched I understand it is an
[10595.12 → 10603.04] enterprise GPU, but they launched a 96 gig VRAM GPU that's crazy I would have covered that 400 to 600
[10603.04 → 10611.60] watts TDP I was in the wrong place there's a slimmer max q variant for why was I at GDC all the cool stuff
[10611.60 → 10618.32] happened at etc man how much is this thing going to cost I think like RTX pro 6000 why didn't they just
[10618.32 → 10622.88] keep the squadron name grand at least because they just called it squadron RTX, and then we would have all
[10622.88 → 10627.04] known what we're talking about anyway there's a there's a flow plane video going over
[10627.04 → 10631.20] probably one of the least successful trips I've ever been on if you want to see it cool it's there
[10631.20 → 10635.20] speaking of Wendell I'm reading a book that he recommended to me, it's salt sugar fat sugar salt
[10635.20 → 10638.16] fat whatever it's called it's those three ingredients, and it's basically about how the
[10638.16 → 10643.92] food industry throughout the 90s oh just like before like one of the biggest scams in the world basically
[10643.92 → 10650.08] just like no not the food oh it's way oh dude it's way more insidious than that it's like way worse
[10650.08 → 10653.92] um it's bad though yeah I'm like a quarter of the way through it, I'm like
[10656.80 → 10662.00] oh so like is this what spurred like your like massive weight loss program and everything because
[10662.00 → 10666.56] he's looking he's looking pretty fly these days I didn't actually ask him if that's what spurred it
[10666.56 → 10673.92] and that's just speculation but uh it was it's very eye-opening yeah uh can you explain what etc and GDC
[10673.92 → 10677.60] are and their differences yeah sure they're one hour away from each other one of them is in San
[10677.60 → 10683.76] Francisco one of them is San Jose GDC they have the same first letter same last letter and an
[10683.76 → 10691.12] extremely similar sounding middle letter GDC is game developers conference etc is graphics technology
[10691.12 → 10699.84] conference they're completely different things we were brought to GDC and show nothing and uh things
[10699.84 → 10711.28] happened at etc, and we weren't there it was very cool yes it was great also at etc uh the project
[10711.28 → 10718.64] digits mini pc is now the DX spark with a founder's edition or OEM versions from Asus dell and hp
[10719.36 → 10726.80] uh compact power efficient form factor gb10 chip with a thousand AI tops Blackwell architecture 128 gigabytes of
[10726.80 → 10732.96] unified memory for up to 200 billion parameters and a pre-installed AI software stack you can connect
[10732.96 → 10741.28] two together to work with models up to 405 billion parameters very cool and also 5 billion parameters
[10741.28 → 10748.96] also they announced GDAX station a desktop sized motherboard with a new Blackwell ultra gb300 so
[10748.96 → 10756.16] it's kind of like a beefed up version of spark huh it has a gb300 grace Blackwell ultra desktop super chip
[10756.16 → 10765.60] up to 784 gigs of coherent memory so if you can afford it this will be a serious uh blow to the
[10765.60 → 10771.04] Mac mini that everyone's just basically our Mac mini excuse me the mac studio that everyone's using for
[10771.04 → 10780.64] AI right now uh has a connect x8 super nick for up to 800 gigabits per second envy link c2c or I guess
[10780.64 → 10784.48] that's chip to chip for high bandwidth data transfer between processors and accelerators
[10784.48 → 10792.80] and NVIDIA's DX OS and AI software stack pretty cool that's nuts now also belt rick says coherent memory
[10792.80 → 10800.72] um uh oh memory coherency I'm trying to remember exactly what that means um see like i could
[10800.72 → 10804.56] I could talk about this stuff if we were there that would have been cool that would have been sweet
[10804.56 → 10810.72] yeah that would have been super cool all right I don't want to explain memory coherency without
[10810.72 → 10817.28] looking at first because it's been a little while but basically oh basically I don't want to do this
[10817.28 → 10818.40] I'm going to do it anyway yeah
[10821.52 → 10828.80] just don't do it sure fine you're just going to get quoted basically means better performance there
[10828.80 → 10838.48] good yep Vera CPU will be NVIDIA's first with fully custom arm cores instead of off-the-shelf core
[10838.48 → 10846.56] designs Vera CPU has 88 custom arm cores 176 threads combines with Ruben GPU for uh I thought I said
[10846.56 → 10857.12] very at first I said very Ruben Vera Ruben 2026 two GPUs 50 of fp4 288 gigabytes of hbm4
[10857.12 → 10863.04] yikes crazy time yeah so in a nutshell better performance across multiple processors
[10864.16 → 10871.60] this stuff is all very expensive do we have pricing no but I promise you
[10873.44 → 10878.48] every single thing announced down there is going to be like very premium didn't they say spark was
[10878.48 → 10883.12] going to be like a few grand or something like that I think so if sparks a few grand then DX station
[10883.12 → 10890.48] is going to be absurd over 10 so and people are going to buy it for sure 100 100 for sure I mean
[10890.48 → 10895.60] we picked up one of the new mac studios with the uh the top memory configuration because uh nick from
[10895.60 → 10900.72] the lab said that they would use it so I was like we need one for a review anyway so I guess lets we
[10900.72 → 10906.40] will definitely use it let's do it yep I mean that was like nine grand or something like that so
[10906.40 → 10911.04] there'd be no reason for NVIDIA to price anything below that that's for sure no yeah
[10914.00 → 10920.80] okay is that it for topics oh no pebble founders new company releases core 2 duo
[10921.52 → 10925.84] love the name why are really upset about this some people are upset about oh I think it's dumb
[10926.64 → 10930.40] his new company name or the product some people are upset about the product I mean not the name oh
[10930.40 → 10935.28] really yeah oh no I'm not upset about the product uh anyway the new company is called core
[10935.28 → 10942.24] devices, and he's opened pre-orders for two new pebble OS devices the core time 2 with a one and a half
[10942.24 → 10951.28] inch colour e-paper touch screen and the paper core 2 duo a 1.2 inch black and white e-paper screen prices
[10951.28 → 10959.28] start at 149 us dollars the core 2 duo name explains the whole idea says founder Eric midiakovsky
[10959.92 → 10964.72] it's like a pebble 2, but it's made by core devices and then duo is for do over
[10971.92 → 10977.20] okay it's expected to start shipping in July of this year with the core time 2 slated to follow in
[10977.20 → 10983.76] December the pebble founder also made a long blog post um detailing how apple users will experience
[10983.76 → 10990.00] less functionality and lays responsibility solely on apple who restricts third-party watches for
[10990.00 → 10997.36] security reasons for example third-party watches cannot send texts or I messages take actions on
[10997.36 → 11003.20] notifications detect if you are using your phone I'm midiakovsky suggests contacting your elected
[11003.20 → 11008.00] representatives to support relevant legislation if you want to see proper iPhone support in the future
[11008.00 → 11014.72] our discussion question here is are you ready to give up your iPhone for a better pebble experience
[11015.28 → 11019.76] yes I'm gonna I'm gonna daily it 100 I'm so ready I'm not surprised
[11019.76 → 11027.52] I'm super ready yeah I want the colour one though like I had a pebble time like a thousand years ago
[11027.52 → 11030.48] that I colour display I'm not going to go back to a black and white display isn't the black and white
[11030.48 → 11038.24] one cheaper uh yeah well no the black and white one came out first like originally no I mean out of the
[11038.24 → 11041.92] new ones oh yeah yeah it's cheaper yeah so that makes sense but like I doesn't mean you have to get
[11041.92 → 11045.76] the cheaper one I'm just saying the colour one I think I don't think it necessarily doesn't have
[11045.76 → 11050.80] market fit just might not be oh yeah no, no yeah if it's super affordable then that's cool if people
[11050.80 → 11055.44] just want a minimalist thing like that was the whole idea like back in the day yeah here let's
[11055.44 → 11062.08] go ahead and I want to see it though do they look any good yeah oh yeah cool okay yeah sure
[11062.08 → 11067.44] good it's good got some nice chunky buttons I like my buttons I can press with gloves I love to see it
[11067.44 → 11073.60] this these having nice good chunky actual buttons makes me actually want one and i I don't want
[11073.60 → 11077.28] smartwatches and I'm I mean I'm not going to get one because I would lose it in two days but
[11077.28 → 11088.16] I really like the buttons nice happy okay is it after dark time there is one I just don't think i
[11088.16 → 11092.16] care cool nice then yes neat let's go
[11096.48 → 11102.24] he's doing it let's watch him do it's a retro future he's not doing anything wow oh
[11103.60 → 11111.28] oh got him we got owned we got owned pretty bad there actually hey, hey does nothing
[11114.96 → 11123.76] hi Wanda normally i pre uh preloaded but you uh skipped the last topic so I was behind I'm sorry
[11123.76 → 11131.44] hi Wanda DLL I know Luke has been uh has played ft but have you played multiverse the best thing in pc
[11131.44 → 11139.68] gaming are those mods that keep adding gameplay oh ft multiverse the mod um yes I have yeah uh it
[11139.68 → 11140.96] seems really cool i
[11145.84 → 11151.68] wasn't way too into it um I don't know if it's configurable maybe it's configurable I find
[11151.68 → 11158.80] sometimes with mods they kind of do too much um and i I felt that way with multiverse personally I'm not
[11158.80 → 11163.12] trying to dissuade anyone from trying if it's very cool I'm happy that I did try it, but it was just
[11163.12 → 11169.76] kind of lot like i i I installed it and jumped in and was like whoa where'd my game go you know like
[11171.28 → 11178.56] that wasn't really what I was looking for um, but it's an it's a pretty wild mod I'm happy someone made
[11178.56 → 11184.32] it I'm happy people to enjoy if it's just I don't know i liked it how it was you're getting
[11184.32 → 11189.04] called out for ending your segments with I don't know by the way yeah I saw that um and I'm gonna
[11189.04 → 11195.20] keep doing it because it's my it's my insurance against people that go after you really yeah oh
[11195.20 → 11201.36] yeah I can kind of see that but also I don't know I don't know everyone's way too serious about
[11202.96 → 11209.28] everything these days that if you say something they have automatically decided that you will
[11209.28 → 11215.52] die on the hill for what you just said, and it's like no this is a four-hour thing where I like
[11215.52 → 11222.00] 25 care about whatever I'm saying at any given time like this is not he only has one hour of care
[11222.00 → 11227.04] like the original land show was about an hour yeah, and we've taken that exact same amount of care and
[11227.04 → 11232.64] extrapolated over four hours yeah like no leave me alone so I'll say something and then just be like i
[11232.64 → 11236.00] don't know because I'm just like leave me alone we've got the same amount of margarine okay
[11236.00 → 11244.48] we got four pieces of toast, and it's still not butter yeah yeah yeah he's awake now he's doing
[11244.48 → 11251.68] it, but this is just like man like I don't I I could replace it with but I don't care, but they're not
[11251.68 → 11258.48] going to like that as much so it's I don't know look guys we never cosplayed as journalists so no, but it's
[11258.48 → 11264.16] just like seriously it's an it's a like leave me the f alone disclaimer that I put on the end of things
[11264.16 → 11271.20] I'm not like actually that uncertain about so many things i just I don't care I think you should
[11271.20 → 11277.44] speak with more conviction I don't know but I don't know what you do your own thing I don't know
[11279.12 → 11286.00] and like I don't even disagree with you, i just I don't care it's wan show I don't want to deal with
[11286.00 → 11292.40] something I don't know i maybe i just maybe I should have added to the placebo conversation we had a few
[11292.40 → 11297.04] weeks ago I don't know maybe I didn't and that's why we ended up in crap hold on I'm being called a
[11297.04 → 11307.44] bastard by one of our regular commenters in plane jet dyslexic stoner 240 oh dyslexic stoner 240 says
[11307.44 → 11312.08] this is f***ING entertainment you guys don't do anything stupid like call yourselves journalists
[11312.08 → 11319.92] I missed that uh but okay, but you know what I think you actually said it before I said it so
[11319.92 → 11325.12] I think he wins good work you got you win but yeah like that that placebo thing maybe I didn't add
[11325.12 → 11329.52] the I don't know to the end of it yeah you should like why are you listening to some tech podcast and
[11329.52 → 11337.12] like blindly taking medical advice here's a question is googled it is this even a tech podcast not really i
[11337.12 → 11343.68] think the tech is more of the carrier yeah it's the bread for the peanut butter and jam yeah, and it's
[11343.68 → 11352.08] wonder bread yeah sometimes hey look it's really sometimes you get an artisanal sourdough
[11352.08 → 11357.84] sometimes we have some meat sometimes we have some tech meat sure okay sometimes we have other meat
[11359.84 → 11365.20] the point is the point is I don't think that's actually why people tune into the
[11365.20 → 11371.76] wan show no we've talked about this guarantee you it's not because like i we have had off the air
[11371.76 → 11378.24] conversations many times when I expressed kind of my disbelief that the wan show is our lowest
[11378.24 → 11384.16] production value property that we probably didn't have one bread slice worth of cares to spread over it
[11384.16 → 11391.04] back when it was an hour long um, but people tuned into it, and it was him that finally kind of convinced
[11391.04 → 11396.72] me that it had a value and that was just like hanging out and like kind of talking about tech
[11396.72 → 11403.12] yeah sometimes but also not maybe because I don't think I have any friends in my life
[11404.08 → 11408.00] or anyone that I have a relationship with that I would want to talk to about the exact same thing
[11408.00 → 11413.28] every time I talk to them yeah and so it took me a long time to kind of figure out why the wan show works
[11413.28 → 11415.20] it's because of Dan
[11419.76 → 11424.16] I love how he frantically pressed I think backspace at the same time
[11425.28 → 11429.68] it was like the loudest key inputs you've had all night no that was just me shaking my head violently
[11429.68 → 11436.16] oh that was just the head okay yeah all right nice um but yeah that's kind of you guys yeah it's because
[11436.16 → 11444.32] off that's why I say I don't know that's why that is entirely why it's because I'm just tired of it
[11444.96 → 11450.16] I don't I've told people before after every wan show and I'm going to keep doing it and I don't care and if
[11450.16 → 11454.48] you want to abuse it do it I don't care I'm going to keep doing it I control f for my name and I look for
[11454.48 → 11459.52] stuff and some people use that, and they'll, they'll just say my name like four times and be like sorry i
[11459.52 → 11464.40] just wanted to like to get this message sure say his name I'm not going to respond to all of them but I'll do that
[11464.40 → 11468.00] because I'm not going to read every comment oh my god but I'll look for some of them because if
[11468.00 → 11473.36] something's like important I do want to fix it I feel called out right now but uh, and he didn't
[11473.36 → 11477.92] even say I don't know he didn't even say I don't know so that was full conviction now we're going to know
[11477.92 → 11486.24] he's got to tell now we'll know when he adamantly believes something but I'm writing a rant post right
[11486.24 → 11490.72] now about the brewing animosity between these two if he's all like people are doing a float planchette
[11490.72 → 11495.12] yeah, so then there was this one time when Linus's narcissistic behaviour was on full display
[11496.56 → 11500.00] and he just leaves it right there and there's no I don't know I don't know
[11501.84 → 11503.84] then I would feel something if I wasn't such a sociopath
[11508.56 → 11512.32] Dan do you want to give us another merch message but yeah i just I hate when i do that and i
[11512.32 → 11518.08] find stuff that's like a correction on something that just like deeply doesn't matter and like actually
[11518.08 → 11523.52] uh this part has shown through sometimes because someone like I'll, I'll say something and then i
[11523.52 → 11527.68] correct myself and then flow plane corrects me and then I'm like yeah I know and I correct it again
[11527.68 → 11532.08] and then people just keep poking and people will see that I like get really annoyed by it and there
[11532.08 → 11535.76] will be comments being like oh you shouldn't let that get under your skin so much and I'm like yeah
[11535.76 → 11541.28] the problem is because I deal with this constantly and I deal with this probably like two percent as
[11541.28 → 11546.08] much as he does so I don't know how he deals I almost swore again I don't know how he deals with it
[11546.08 → 11551.04] so it's just like watches this show you have to watch your time yeah I do um, but it's like it's
[11551.04 → 11558.64] ah man and like issuing corrections good wouldn't they matter yeah and I think this correction mattered
[11559.60 → 11564.56] are we talking about the one today oh no that one mattered sure yeah I'm just talking uh
[11565.44 → 11572.96] um more universally like sure I don't know sometimes it's just like guys get off the internet for a
[11572.96 → 11577.76] second maybe Maria has a proposal it's not that deep you could just do a blanket I don't know at
[11577.76 → 11583.52] the end of the show like I don't know bye oh that's not a bad it's not bad that's not, not bad it would
[11583.52 → 11592.56] be a nice it would be a nice in joke for the uh Casper explorer says um uh Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke
[11592.56 → 11599.12] Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke
[11599.12 → 11609.36] Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke
[11612.96 → 11618.56] Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke Luke.
[11618.56 → 11620.74] Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke.
[11622.30 → 11625.28] Did you ever use the Think phone?
[11627.30 → 11627.74] No.
[11628.16 → 11628.70] Okay, cool.
[11628.80 → 11630.30] Dan, do you want to hear some of the merch message?
[11630.34 → 11630.52] Sure.
[11630.60 → 11633.62] I also added some text as a disclaimer on screen at all times now.
[11638.74 → 11639.72] Can I have one too?
[11640.24 → 11641.22] Can I have one too?
[11641.70 → 11642.34] Yeah, sure.
[11644.22 → 11645.56] Do you want to make it like slightly?
[11646.18 → 11647.54] Just give me a second here.
[11647.64 → 11648.08] I'm sure.
[11648.56 → 11652.16] Or you just copy and paste it.
[11652.34 → 11653.34] I could have doesn't care.
[11653.88 → 11654.74] That's not bad.
[11655.24 → 11655.80] That's not bad.
[11655.90 → 11656.86] No one doesn't care.
[11660.80 → 11661.66] Oh, man.
[11664.00 → 11664.82] Someone's going to do it.
[11664.82 → 11668.50] Did you see that every word from the WAN show in alphabetical order video?
[11668.96 → 11670.86] Someone's going to do that, but with this episode.
[11670.86 → 11673.58] You're just going to say Luke like a million times.
[11673.58 → 11687.78] You're the f***ING guy.
[11687.96 → 11689.38] I didn't see it coming off.
[11689.58 → 11691.88] Oh, my God.
[11691.88 → 11707.00] oh wow okay um okay dad hit me hey bad cholesterol uh question for Luke I don't know as a machine
[11707.00 → 11712.24] learning researcher I was surprised that you said you never used macOS since most people I know in
[11712.24 → 11722.34] the field use that or Linux why uh I just don't like it is it um and I mean the mac minis and
[11722.34 → 11729.80] stuff are like uh amazing and by never use see this is this person's great, but this is my
[11729.80 → 11736.92] point by never use I didn't mean literally never use I meant I've never like mainlined it like I've
[11736.92 → 11743.48] I've used it I've i have i have used it um I just mean it's not like running on
[11743.48 → 11749.24] any of the computers that i daily that that's what I meant by that, and it never has I've never dailyed
[11749.24 → 11756.20] an apple operating system um and that's that's what I meant by that so you're I'm not going after this
[11756.20 → 11760.24] person, but this is what I mean by when I had I don't know it's just the like
[11760.24 → 11765.52] there's probably 17 different ways to interpret what I just said and
[11765.52 → 11768.20] most of them are wrong you'd be a terrible witness
[11768.20 → 11776.06] terrible where were you on the night of january 32nd I was probably at home doing whatever but i
[11776.06 → 11781.88] don't know yeah actually so you're going to jail january 32nd you are going to jail because i
[11781.88 → 11788.38] actually know exactly where I was on January 31st accurately I know for sure did I say january 32nd i
[11788.38 → 11794.94] think you said 32nd am I wrong well it's January it's january 32nd somewhere
[11794.94 → 11802.12] I just crossed time zones apparently you did but I don't know cool we'd have to watch the tape back
[11802.12 → 11806.76] it's amazing that I was functional he flashed it
[11806.76 → 11814.06] maybe I'll just turn these into buttons for you guys
[11814.06 → 11820.72] having a narcissist button for life would be hilarious so Luke you get a narcissist button
[11820.72 → 11823.04] and Linus does not know
[11823.04 → 11828.34] that would genuinely be so good
[11828.34 → 11837.76] oh my god um what are we even saying oh yeah so i I like I've I've used it um i just I don't know
[11837.76 → 11841.68] something about I've told this story before too my mom had an android phone for a long time
[11841.68 → 11848.90] my mom had an android phone for a long time, and she struggled with it forever and then
[11848.90 → 11852.68] she got an iPhone because she needed to because she's working in the film industry, and they use
[11852.68 → 11858.96] like airdrop and a lot of things like that um and like within a day she was way better with her
[11858.96 → 11865.06] iPhone than she ever was with her android it just clicked I'm the opposite of that I find the iPhone
[11865.06 → 11872.00] just the clunky and unintuitive yeah and that is similar to me with macOS it just doesn't feel
[11872.00 → 11878.12] right something feels wrong I find Linux easier to use than macOS I'm not saying that's right it
[11878.12 → 11882.74] just feels that weird to me, I think a big part of the issue for me is just the slowness of the
[11882.74 → 11889.34] animations that feel really weird I had to use an um i I think you mentioned in your review but I had
[11889.34 → 11894.38] to backspace on something recently a macBook oh hold it down, and it just like takes a thousand years
[11894.38 → 11898.28] speaking of never using macOS I used a macBook while I was on my trip because I had to write
[11898.28 → 11902.94] a script on one um and yeah I went to backspace and I was just like what's happening like is the
[11902.94 → 11909.22] computer lagging out like why is it so slow um that's just so weird I don't know i I'm sure
[11909.22 → 11913.96] there's some app that you can download that will fix it for you yeah I don't know and I'm not dogging
[11913.96 → 11919.94] on macOS a bunch of people love it and that's great i I genuinely have no issue I'm not whatever
[11919.94 → 11925.60] I'm just I am very used to windows when i run Linux i I like running windows mint because it
[11925.60 → 11933.82] feels windows-issue to me, I'm very used to if it's intuitive to me um that's all Errol though iOS does
[11933.82 → 11937.68] not have a settings button in the quick settings to jump to the full settings but what they do have
[11937.68 → 11947.66] is the ability to uh bind any app so what you can do is you can make an app say windows make a setting
[11947.66 → 11953.52] make a settings app link in your quick settings, and then it will go through the breadcrumbs for
[11953.52 → 11958.78] no apparent reason because all I want to do is access my settings and I was on my home screen
[11958.78 → 11966.52] before I started so whatever um but yeah no that that is a thing that you can do and maybe this
[11966.52 → 11972.50] is me like being kind of snobby and aptly, but it actually bothers me a lot that there it still
[11972.50 → 11977.64] bothers me that there isn't a settings one by default because the settings cog is the only thing I care to
[11977.64 → 11983.26] have in there and now the style doesn't match because it's in colour and all the rest of them are black and
[11983.26 → 11989.84] white that's so random it doesn't it doesn't matter it doesn't matter okay I don't know whatever
[11989.84 → 12001.16] test your button oh, oh yeah buddy oh let's go I love it um I can't make the narcissist one right
[12001.16 → 12007.16] now it's too complicated okay um I could, I'm sure
[12007.16 → 12015.74] I have to do it manually like a pleb shoot there was a dang it there was a thing and sorry i kind of
[12015.74 → 12019.60] i kind of dogged on the person who left that message i it wasn't I was just explaining that
[12019.60 → 12024.48] that is one of the cases why I don't know, and people person was great people can't follow every
[12024.48 → 12029.34] little like aspect of everything, and we don't expect that 100 all I'm ever really asking for
[12029.34 → 12033.92] in this stuff is to not assume the worst yes and that seems to be too much to ask for a lot of people
[12033.92 → 12040.38] yeah oh our archive asks any update on the lab's lanyard I don't but I did send an email on my flight
[12040.38 → 12046.16] this very early in the morning um asking for that to be followed up I will also say with the
[12046.16 → 12051.68] ask not to assume the worst thing i kind of get it because there are a lot of bad things right now
[12051.68 → 12058.56] but it's just it's its a very dark life to live when you assume that everything is bad and I don't
[12058.56 → 12066.22] understand a lot of things are bad but like just try to lift above that um anyway okay a few more here
[12066.22 → 12072.50] Luke I'm 14 and starting a weight loss and muscle gain journey not a question uh I have tried this
[12072.50 → 12081.02] before but can't stick to it any tips um what I've said in the past is that that's probably because
[12081.02 → 12087.54] you're leaning on motivation instead of uh commitment or determination or whatever else
[12087.54 → 12094.94] motivation is very temporary you have to find um you have to find a way to make yourself do it even
[12094.94 → 12099.48] when you don't want to the only way you're ever going to be able to keep doing anything you want
[12099.48 → 12105.32] to do is if even when you don't want to do it you do it anyway um like my only motivation for
[12105.32 → 12111.00] staying in shape is that I want to be good at badminton yeah that's i I want to I want my score
[12111.00 → 12115.68] to be higher than the person on the other side of the court mine is I just don't want to be broken
[12115.68 → 12122.24] and when I'm say twice as old as I am now I still want to be able to like to move around and do things
[12122.24 → 12127.86] and I have a decent amount of like problems from sports or whatever else um so I need to keep on
[12127.86 → 12132.90] top of it I need to keep on top of it now and I can never stop I think I had this conversation with
[12132.90 → 12138.44] you not that long ago where it's like going to the gym is not like a thing for me now going to the
[12138.44 → 12145.94] he stops swimming he dies I mean sort of though like I have to keep on working out for the whole
[12145.94 → 12150.86] rest of my life like there is no I'm just sort of into this interested in this now I have to go all
[12150.86 → 12156.60] the time forever, and it's not it's no it's no longer a motivation thing it started as a motivation
[12156.60 → 12162.56] thing don't punch him in the nose I heard him but I had to convert it, and you'll have to find some way
[12162.56 → 12170.80] to convert it is can't, it can't be motivation it has to be a complete unwillingness to not do it
[12170.80 → 12178.70] yeah Dan I'm going to need a separate I'm going to need a separate button does no non-negotiable
[12178.70 → 12186.58] because he didn't he said that with conviction yeah I'm running out of um pre-made
[12186.58 → 12192.98] ones to overwrite I believe in discipline is a good word for it yeah I don't know if I said that
[12192.98 → 12197.82] but okay but yeah you have to, and you have to do it yourself you said you're 14 uh this is cool that
[12197.82 → 12203.94] you're going after this now but this is one of the perfect time in your life to learn
[12203.94 → 12210.14] and to push yourself to do something without your parents pushing you know um I think at that
[12210.14 → 12214.44] point in your life there's a lot of like you know you show up to every practice for the sport that you
[12214.44 → 12218.72] play because your parent gets you there they get you up from whatever you're doing they drive you
[12218.72 → 12225.60] they do all this kind of stuff do this yourself um or find an accountability buddy that is also a
[12225.60 → 12231.18] very good way to that can also help you get over the hump of the change from motivation to
[12231.18 → 12237.92] discipline like if i ever don't feel like going to badminton but like it's a group of 12 people
[12237.92 → 12244.02] or whatever they expect you to be there we booked two courts so if I don't show up everyone else is
[12244.02 → 12248.50] going to pay eight percent more for the session and the numbers are going to be odd so the rotations
[12248.50 → 12253.12] are going to be off yeah so find like a workout buddy or even i I had one remote for a while
[12253.12 → 12259.10] who was a buddy I knew online, and we had a check-in and I don't need this anymore I have the discipline
[12259.10 → 12264.40] now I go all the time, but we had a check-in where you had to take a picture at the gym it didn't have
[12264.40 → 12267.88] to be a nice picture it could be a picture of the floor mats it didn't it didn't even have to be of
[12267.88 → 12272.26] you, but you had to check in I'm here had to be unique to picture every time you have the metadata
[12272.26 → 12278.60] it was taken you know like you know it's real um, and they send you them back and you just you check
[12278.60 → 12281.24] in with each other and make sure that you're actually doing it there 's's a multiple
[12281.24 → 12286.28] ways to do that um you might even be able to find one like through the Ltd community somehow or
[12286.28 → 12292.14] something like that I don't know um, but there's oh they do the same reason see the reason why I said
[12292.14 → 12296.60] I don't know there is like oh they're 14 maybe they shouldn't be I don't know I'm not sure but
[12296.60 → 12303.42] all I'm saying is just try to you'll you'll gain a ton from this if you don't see I know now I'm being
[12303.42 → 12309.06] confident now you'll gain a ton from this if you do it uh under your own volition and not as a drive
[12309.06 → 12312.66] from your parents I think that'd be perfect yeah super cool I'm glad you're thinking about it
[12312.66 → 12317.94] they have to do more than think about it let's go yeah hell yeah keep it up
[12317.94 → 12329.16] darn okay well let's see hi Wanda DLL Linus if you had destroyed the 5090 in the power connector
[12329.16 → 12335.02] video what would you have done would you have published the video anyway uh no I don't think
[12335.02 → 12342.12] there would have been anything to really say the story arc was uh there was no arcing uh this
[12342.12 → 12347.28] the story was we've got this thing that has a fundamentally flawed connector on it
[12347.28 → 12354.08] what would have prevented them from just having a XT connector on either end and obviously we
[12354.08 → 12357.50] didn't put a XT connector on the power supply because we weren't going to go advocating for
[12357.50 → 12361.76] people opening up power supplies any more than we already have in the past so we just you know
[12361.76 → 12367.48] turned the cable into the connector that we needed um with a very secure attachment
[12367.48 → 12372.28] other man I couldn't believe the war that started over soldering versus crimping connectors
[12372.28 → 12382.34] guys that was just banter on set like chill uh it's all good uh anyway the point is um the whole
[12382.34 → 12389.28] idea was hey would an alternate connector that doesn't have that isn't so close to the edge uh
[12389.28 → 12393.92] would an alternate connector that doesn't have this kind of fundamental flaws in the design where
[12393.92 → 12398.64] everything gets combined into one where you just have one big conductor one big connector that
[12398.64 → 12403.78] that mates really securely would that just work fine and could we have just done that in the first
[12403.78 → 12408.86] place that, and it was more meant to be kind of amusing slash comical it was supposed to be kind of
[12408.86 → 12415.12] like a top gear solution not a real solution um so without its kind of like asking if they're
[12416.04 → 12420.96] you know if their DIY electric car hadn't run would they have published that episode no I think that
[12420.96 → 12424.12] you just keep going until the DIY car runs I think we would have cut up another card
[12424.12 → 12431.58] which I hadn't cleared with anybody yet but that would have been what the executive decision would
[12431.58 → 12435.98] have ultimately been after the team discussed it one person in the labs that was like
[12435.98 → 12445.86] not excited about all that nick we have a have a limited amount of 50 90s sorry nick, and we need
[12445.86 → 12451.82] like a lot more sorry nick by the way sorry nick like so many more my apologies to nick we're talking
[12451.82 → 12460.32] about expanding the benches so we have more I get it look how do I say this without it um reflecting
[12460.32 → 12466.86] poorly on previous leadership you say I don't know afterwards right um okay here hold on a
[12466.86 → 12475.86] second I could just move it i never once denied a request for equipment to any previous management
[12475.86 → 12478.98] what are you doing oh he's putting himself over there
[12478.98 → 12490.22] oh my goodness yeah I didn't think it would get denied which is kind of how I reassured it's fine
[12490.22 → 12493.68] yeah if they need something we'll get it for them of course right now it just sucks because I don't
[12493.68 → 12498.30] want to pay a bunch of scalpers yeahs so I want to buy the cards like legitimately and that's just hard
[12498.30 → 12502.50] to do right now like the whole thing like Linus is cheap and won't spend money on his business
[12502.50 → 12508.12] thing or whatever came out of the uh the billet labs thing right which never had anything to do
[12508.12 → 12513.60] with the dollar value that dollar value was just a number i threw out yes um and my whole point was
[12513.60 → 12519.60] an expense my whole point was that it just wasn't the point yeah it's just worded in a way I get it
[12519.60 → 12524.40] you had to add the had to add the thing yeah, but it's not on my side right now yeah okay move it
[12524.40 → 12529.28] over here yeah there you go okay there you go, so my whole thing there was just that you're you're
[12529.28 → 12536.14] basically asking me for the fuel economy of a concept car that you know is upside where the
[12536.14 → 12542.68] passengers or the driver's seat is upside down like who cares um nice it was not going to impact
[12542.68 → 12548.56] ultimately anyone's decision to buy this product it was not going to impact its viability in the market
[12548.56 → 12554.90] and I ended up being right that product got one limited production run and was never restocked once
[12554.90 → 12559.36] it's not a real product it was never a real product I don't they didn't seem to know that
[12559.36 → 12567.36] um, but they figured it out eventually it's not a real product it has no viable market um and
[12567.36 → 12573.72] I understand why people were upset at what they felt was a lack of due diligence, but my point always was
[12573.72 → 12578.28] even if it performs exactly like the manufacturer says I hear it's just though it's not relevant you
[12578.28 → 12583.46] worded it I know yeah no because the way I worded it was I'm not going to spend some dollar value
[12583.46 → 12590.34] I forget what it was yeah uh on testing this thing when it doesn't matter yeah and people latched on to
[12590.34 → 12597.72] that dollar value as though that was the thing that mattered bad wording i I spend 500 on this
[12597.72 → 12605.60] business without even in fact without even approving it like what's your manager approval limit
[12605.60 → 12615.12] it's actually like I think it's low what is it 2000 yeah, so literally there's a funny loophole though
[12615.12 → 12620.90] literally I don't even have this I do know literally I do not even have to be involved
[12620.90 → 12627.96] in a decision to spend 500 I literally won't even know it is utterly meaningless the point
[12627.96 → 12632.50] Taryn doesn't even have to be the point of that amount of money the point of me throwing out that
[12632.50 → 12639.08] amount was to demonstrate that I wouldn't spend anything to test if it wasn't about the value
[12639.08 → 12643.94] it wasn't about that at all it wasn't about the money you know that I've had to seek approval to
[12643.94 → 12644.76] save money before
[12644.76 → 12654.38] because we had there been a monthly subscription and I was like we could move it to the yearly
[12654.38 → 12659.96] subscription, and we'll save like 20 or something but by moving into the yearly subscription it went
[12659.96 → 12665.60] above your approval limit yeah yeah that actually does make sense because from a cash flow standpoint
[12665.60 → 12672.34] in a business that was like managed on the edge I just think it's funny we're not we can afford
[12672.34 → 12678.90] an annual subscription, and we typically tend to do that I just think it's funny okay I also think
[12678.90 → 12683.58] it's funny that I sometimes have to like waste Taryn's time by asking for approval to like buy
[12683.58 → 12688.66] power supplies for a channel that has to test power supplies all the time oh yeah why do you have to do
[12688.66 → 12694.72] that because it's sometimes we buy a batch of power supplies that's more than two grand got it okay
[12694.72 → 12700.78] yeah fine it's fine is there anyone other than Taryn that can approve more than two grand
[12700.78 → 12706.12] I don't think so I mean I don't know I'm not, not on accounting or whatever but I don't think so
[12706.12 → 12713.52] I did that process this week I believe it's Linus of on end Taryn oh yeah I mean that makes sense
[12713.52 → 12717.42] what's my limit I was going to say do you have to do you have to ask yourself what happens in that
[12717.42 → 12724.16] scenario I don't know I don't I want to know what my approval limit is if you tell me I'll put it in
[12724.16 → 12729.40] our system like right now and then automate that yeah because he is the oh man I'm so excited for that
[12729.40 → 12735.14] man I'm so excited I don't want to use a stupid form thing anymore I was gushing about it to Sammy
[12735.14 → 12739.02] we did the Dan dailies thing and I ended up talking about it for 20 minutes, and he's like this should
[12739.02 → 12746.24] be another video can you shut up so good yeah hey boss you're live on the wan show hi hi hi how's it
[12746.24 → 12753.00] going yeah so I could uh do you have like 30 seconds of course yeah so yeah I shouldn't say
[12753.00 → 12762.60] uh i I don't know uh okay so how was your trip yeah uh trip was good trip was good so uh Luke was
[12762.60 → 12768.96] mentioning that his approval limit for purchases is two grand and I was wondering what's my approval
[12768.96 → 12774.02] limit like at what point at what point do I have to like talk to someone when we're buying something
[12774.02 → 12780.28] you ignore uh you ignore the approval makers that we have so I find out about step up with the
[12780.28 → 12787.54] fact got it okay but I think based on my question we could probably conclude that that was out of
[12787.54 → 12794.30] ignorance not malice right uh it's out of ignorance not malice um basically you know the ongoing
[12794.30 → 12799.40] team that we have is we just need to communicate better as a company so ultimately you send the final
[12799.40 → 12805.94] final checks and the final numbers and everything else uh so YOLO right uh we just need to make
[12805.94 → 12811.36] sure that we're talking on a regular basis just so that everybody's on the same page and what's going
[12811.36 → 12818.60] on okay cool yeah uh thank you very much thanks boss thank you okay bye that was a really
[12818.60 → 12826.14] good answer so basically you don't have an approval limit just everyone has to work around you okay i
[12826.14 → 12832.82] mean that's the way it's always been yes you can tell it just like doesn't bother him he's like uh
[12832.82 → 12838.46] he used to it well he knew what he signed up for yeah I mean he's known me for it's a very good
[12838.46 → 12845.40] answer to be honest dude I've known Taryn for almost 20 years it makes sense that's crazy makes sense
[12845.40 → 12856.88] um yeah so like I mean he that's over half of yours he was working as a senior in my department
[12856.88 → 12863.88] where I was a junior when I would literally like not come into work because it snowed thinking that
[12863.88 → 12872.46] work had like a snow day like to give you some idea of the level of of of greenness that I had
[12872.46 → 12878.04] when i when I joined the industry when I joined the workforce essentially Taryn was there
[12878.04 → 12883.90] and then he was my boss a couple of years later what's that uh GEICO or whatever what's that like
[12883.90 → 12891.82] insurance company so-and-so was there oh yeah I'm not sure but like yeah like he he he saw me at my
[12891.82 → 12898.62] very worst like had to give me like dressings down back when I would make like egregious
[12898.62 → 12904.44] mistakes of errors of judgment or whatever else um, so yeah like I said he knew what he signed
[12904.44 → 12909.48] up for I'm still me I just run a company now and I have a lot more experience yeah but uh you know
[12909.48 → 12915.70] I tend to be kind of a big picture guy we did this management um we had some consultants come in and do
[12915.70 → 12921.72] like this kind of management um course and I found out what I've known my whole life which is that I am a
[12921.72 → 12928.80] red personality type um which is that I am not overly concerned with details that I consider to be
[12928.80 → 12936.36] unimportant relative to making progress on the bigger picture objective um I was an I was a rare
[12936.36 → 12942.34] Pokémon I was an I was a red blue you were red blue yeah okay do you guys do you guys know that is
[12942.34 → 12947.58] this is this personality colours like a standardized thing uh somewhat it's business Myers breaks
[12947.58 → 12952.80] basically yeah yeah yeah here we go hold on okay
[12952.80 → 12960.52] yeah I could have told you that without an expensive consultant if I remember there was
[12960.52 → 12965.64] different scales to them all, and you were like the furthest you could possibly go on red uh me and
[12965.64 → 12972.76] one other person were Jake well I wasn't oh well he wouldn't mind yeah Jake wouldn't mind read enough
[12972.76 → 12980.80] I know I mean if anything he would want me to say that he was further red and I believe he was I
[12980.80 → 12988.18] don't actually 100 remember but he's a red boy yeah which is maybe why I've always had a bit of a
[12988.18 → 12996.70] soft spot for him, I see a lot of myself in him yeah um by the way gadget guy said make Luke's limit 10k
[12996.70 → 13002.26] I don't actually mind the 2k thing because it I actually don't think Taryn has ever not approved
[13002.26 → 13007.60] anything I've ever asked for, and it ends up just being like a way of informing of major things that's
[13007.60 → 13011.38] the point of it and that's why I wouldn't have asked for it to change and I've never asked for
[13011.38 → 13016.96] mine to raise because people should communicate when they are making major purchases
[13016.96 → 13021.70] it's a good primer to just have the conversation I think two grand is definitely a decent line
[13021.70 → 13027.40] over you know this is just general day-to-day cost of doing business versus this is an expenditure
[13027.40 → 13031.52] I don't know what I would change it to if I wanted to change it which is why I think it's always been
[13031.52 → 13036.24] fine yeah it's also been like it, I don't think he's ever denied any requests, but he's also like
[13036.24 → 13042.70] asked very reasonable questions um which is completely fine he's not he's also not blindly
[13042.70 → 13049.12] approving is what I would say uh golf in float plane chat says about the uh colour personalities it's all
[13049.12 → 13056.18] horseshit what I will say is part of the problem could be the administration of the evaluation
[13056.18 → 13064.24] because looking around at people that I've known in some cases for five years some in some cases for
[13064.24 → 13073.48] 10 years yeah seems about right now there's some confirmation bias there or whatever obviously like
[13073.48 → 13079.10] sure or whatever sampling bias or whatever I feel like you want to be something you could project it
[13079.10 → 13083.28] through your answers on the quiz yeah but given most of us hadn't even like heard of it before we
[13083.28 → 13089.96] did the evaluation and like anyone who was like playing hey what do you think so-and-so is like
[13089.96 → 13095.90] nailed it yeah um yeah yeah yeah it seems there seems to be some I mean at the end of the day
[13095.90 → 13102.28] what the real lesson was not you know memorizing the colours and what these things are the whole
[13102.28 → 13105.84] point of it was that everyone's kind of different and everyone takes a different approach
[13105.84 → 13112.46] and everybody needs different needs fulfilled in order to move forward together as a team that was
[13112.46 → 13117.70] the main point I thought the goal of what they had in regard to explaining the communication stuff
[13117.70 → 13124.72] which I'll do in a second was actually perfect and I've used it to remind people of how we should
[13124.72 → 13130.84] do things uh Dan's probably even heard me mention this probably recently I think I did um where it's like
[13130.84 → 13137.40] what their point was not so much necessarily to self-identify what you were but to make educated
[13137.40 → 13142.28] guesses about what other people might be and tune your communication style to it like they explained
[13142.28 → 13148.38] like the people in the blue category um give them lots of information and good documentation and
[13148.38 → 13153.40] like resources hand it to them, and they'll be happy and don't be super casual about it don't
[13153.40 → 13159.52] because they might treat that as you're not taking it seriously yes but red side don't waste my time
[13159.52 → 13164.38] give them the really important information they need and then and then go away yes, and it's like
[13164.38 → 13170.14] and then go do it yeah right because yeah because nothing else really matters like are we getting it done
[13170.14 → 13176.34] or not I don't need a spreadsheet I need action red and that was our that was my leadership style for a
[13176.34 → 13181.56] very long time that doesn't mean that I'm not capable of communicating with people across the entire
[13181.56 → 13188.84] colour spectrum or whatever but in terms of where my natural residency is its definitely
[13188.84 → 13193.86] definitely, definitely red, but we like we had a conversation recently where we were working with
[13193.86 → 13200.60] another department um and I brought up like hey this department is x colour like work with them this
[13200.60 → 13205.76] way and there's like no way that almost everyone that department wasn't kind of leaning towards the
[13205.76 → 13211.26] same type of communication yeah they 100 did yeah and I think I probably know what department you're
[13211.26 → 13215.12] talking about because I think there's only one department that's like all one colour probably yeah
[13215.12 → 13221.66] uh and did it help yeah so looking back on after like going back on conversations that I've had with
[13221.66 → 13228.62] either like executive teams or other teams like I think Luke and I are quite aligned um I think
[13228.62 → 13234.74] extroverted to use like the Myers-Briggs terms um and when I'm in meetings and I'm like explaining
[13234.74 → 13239.72] things and I'm like answers please why is nobody talking to me all of them have introverted thinking
[13239.72 → 13246.72] and so while they are just like processing in their head and I'm feeling ignored and uh like an island
[13246.72 → 13251.70] uh, and it's kind of scary but thinking back on it yeah no they're paying attention, and they understand
[13251.70 → 13260.38] but they don't have to talk through um like their process or brain goop yeah super useful
[13260.38 → 13268.08] anyway okay moving on not saying it's the be all and end all no you know no we're just saying it's been
[13268.08 → 13273.20] useful in some situations yeah it's people talking about it right at the very least it's like try to
[13273.20 → 13277.38] analyze the type of person you're dealing with and tune your communication towards them if you need
[13277.38 → 13281.26] something from it that's something doesn't work try something else like that was a big part of it too
[13281.26 → 13286.88] it's just you might be wrong like realistically communicate your own needs as well look I was
[13286.88 → 13293.12] chatting with Yvonne about it after, and realistically we could have run the workshop like yeah we're both
[13293.12 → 13297.98] experienced managers, and we've gone through a lot of this but for a lot of members of the team
[13297.98 → 13302.38] where they didn't have this familiarity with working with people that have different
[13302.38 → 13307.32] communication styles and different ways of processing things I think it was incredibly
[13307.32 → 13315.94] valuable we often hire uh I don't know if I want to say inexperienced we offer hire people that
[13315.94 → 13320.62] haven't had career level jobs we're a really young company yeah overall so like there 's's some
[13320.62 → 13324.90] people in there that like had been met I know of at least one person that had been managing for zero
[13324.90 → 13329.66] days when they first stepped in um they came recently been our way through the like promoted
[13329.66 → 13334.92] to it exactly yeah but had zero management experience and well like they were promoted
[13334.92 → 13339.36] as far as I know it was like they had no direct reports yet, and it was the day they were promoted
[13339.36 → 13345.02] and they just showed up so like well they should get the training right obviously all new stuff yeah
[13345.02 → 13356.58] anyway uh sorry reading Slack messages uh first time getting a comment in live I'm considering
[13356.58 → 13360.64] getting a steam deck but I've heard rumours that an updated version is around the corner
[13360.64 → 13366.32] is it worth waiting I mean an updated version of anything is always around the corner depending
[13366.32 → 13368.50] on your definition of around the corner um
[13368.50 → 13380.92] uh I don't think valve has confirmed anything with the current batch of zen 5 Apus and the scuttlebutt
[13380.92 → 13389.88] is that the zen 6 Apus are not getting rDNA 4 if I was going to guess I would say valve would
[13389.88 → 13397.64] probably strike at zen 7 rDNA 4 because what and this is a complete guess on my part because what they
[13397.64 → 13407.76] have said what valve has said is that they want a clear like console level generational leap
[13407.76 → 13415.36] they don't want to get into the habit of just like churning out steam deck models and
[13415.36 → 13423.34] having a complicated legacy product stack uh that they have to figure out how to support on all these
[13423.34 → 13430.26] new OS updates like they want playable on steam deck uh messaging to be very clear that
[13430.26 → 13434.84] means steam deck, and they don't want to be redoing that all the time like steam profiles like some
[13434.84 → 13440.28] games have the steam settings profile built right into them like cyberpunk they want to make it easier
[13440.28 → 13444.18] for game developers I mean they come from game development theoretically at some point they did game
[13444.18 → 13448.60] development right so they want to do this in a way that's really friendly for game developers
[13448.60 → 13454.18] so they have very clearly said they're, and they're not going to get into the same habits as someone like
[13454.18 → 13461.00] an Asus even Asus actually I mean didn't do an updated like the ally x is just updated it doesn't
[13461.00 → 13469.22] use a new processor um so if I had to guess I would say zen 7 rDNA 4 but I don't know that I have no way
[13469.22 → 13474.00] of knowing that um Athos lore says I have the OLED edition, and it's great, and it really is it's a
[13474.00 → 13483.04] it's a beautiful machine sorry um last one I've got for you tonight Linus speaking of how to train
[13483.04 → 13488.70] your dragon have you seen the isle of Burke section at the new epic universe park at universal Orlando
[13488.70 → 13496.28] I have not I've never been to Universal Studios Orlando um it's really far for me, I believe
[13496.28 → 13504.24] florid alike the tip of Florida is the farthest point in Canada U.S. from here actually
[13504.24 → 13512.36] is Newfoundland farther I don't know it's very, very far away though extremely far away like
[13512.36 → 13518.10] uncomfortably far i would never uh I would never just like hop on a plane and jump down there
[13518.10 → 13529.40] um yeah Hawaii no i'm pretty sure that Florida is farther from me than Hawaii hold on now I'm
[13529.40 → 13539.70] there we go maps.google. What is what are this autocompletes what is this look at this is
[13539.70 → 13545.78] hilarious oh it's because I have an in there all right fine I find this fact to be really fun
[13545.78 → 13547.52] okay no here it is
[13547.52 → 13556.92] what are these initial autocompletes what is dot CCA this dot CCA thing is maps.google.com like is
[13556.92 → 13563.22] that a thing what is this why would it autocomplete that I mean this is a is like a barely used
[13563.22 → 13568.82] profile for the wan show profiles are only used for wan that's weird I don't know I don't know
[13568.82 → 13577.84] uh there are distances within Canada that are further than Canada's border is to Europe
[13577.84 → 13586.20] Canada is huge random fun fact how do I switch to the globe view there are like
[13586.20 → 13590.72] logistical decisions that have to be made sometimes where it's actually like cheaper to ship something
[13590.72 → 13594.18] to Europe than it is across Canada because Canada is so big
[13594.18 → 13602.08] this is really far though especially when you factor in how much actually big this is
[13602.08 → 13606.28] and how much this is stretched out because of this view top of the map do you remember how to uh do
[13606.28 → 13612.44] you remember how to change it to globe I can't remember not sure you all want to remind me how to do that
[13612.44 → 13619.70] because uh oh dang that didn't work well whatever you just go to google earth oh okay sure
[13619.70 → 13627.22] I think there's a way to get it in like actual map view as well instead of Google earthing it
[13627.22 → 13634.58] yeah I think so but this get started uh what is this uh what Google Earth seems to have changed
[13634.58 → 13643.14] there we go here we go Africa be actually huge yeah I know right it's huge yep you never
[13643.14 → 13649.68] realize how freaking massive it is until you see it on an actual globe um can I remove the
[13649.68 → 13655.98] clouds that is actually not useful right now is there a maybe under layers bottom there we go
[13655.98 → 13664.36] here we go okay so yeah Vancouver to Florida real far actually like ridiculously far yeah that flight
[13664.36 → 13672.64] sucks um but maybe not farther than to Newfoundland that that looks pretty similar is Newfoundland might
[13672.64 → 13678.28] be further is it worth farther excuse me oh yeah okay but what about Vancouver to the USA
[13678.28 → 13689.50] you mean America to America that's a that's a national flight uh thanks for tuning in we'll see you
[13689.50 → 13694.16] again next week same bad time same bad channel I don't know bye
[13694.16 → 13696.50] bye
[13696.50 → 13701.38] you
