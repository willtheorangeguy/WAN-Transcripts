[0.00 → 6.90] Peter Moline. That's a name I haven't heard.
[8.86 → 12.16] What's up everybody and welcome to the WAN show.
[12.30 → 15.86] We have a great show lined up for you guys this week
[15.86 → 20.70] because people weren't in office much this week.
[20.86 → 23.64] So Luke and I will be making up a lot of things as we go.
[24.08 → 24.44] Yeah.
[24.90 → 28.04] That's right. The RAM shortage is in full swing
[28.04 → 31.72] and there's been even further negative developments.
[32.00 → 33.84] That's right. It has gotten worse.
[33.84 → 37.00] No, I'm serious.
[37.32 → 37.98] Over Christmas?
[39.22 → 39.64] Yes.
[39.78 → 40.64] How could they?
[40.72 → 41.98] It got worse.
[42.26 → 46.12] There's actually system integrators that have come up with the innovation
[46.12 → 50.70] of selling computers without RAM.
[51.66 → 53.14] Bring your own RAM PCs.
[54.20 → 56.68] That is end times shit right there.
[56.86 → 57.62] I will say.
[57.62 → 59.46] End times. No, we're not talking about it yet.
[59.58 → 60.54] Yeah, yeah. Fair, fair, fair, fair, fair, fair.
[60.62 → 66.04] Also, we're going to be talking about how Spotify managed to be entirely scraped.
[66.26 → 66.86] That's right.
[66.92 → 71.02] You can download the entirety of Spotify if, of course, you are a filthy pirate,
[71.14 → 73.40] which, no judgment, you might be.
[74.72 → 80.00] Speaking of scraping, Google sues another company for scraping Google
[80.00 → 82.96] in an act that is very interesting.
[84.34 → 85.24] Okay, thank you.
[85.32 → 86.10] That does sound interesting.
[86.10 → 86.24] We'll see.
[86.38 → 88.38] Also, Valve continues the cheapest Steam Deck.
[90.46 → 92.56] Did you say continues or discontinues?
[92.68 → 93.84] I might have said continues.
[93.96 → 95.06] I meant discontinues.
[95.14 → 95.98] Right. Nice.
[96.18 → 98.20] A bit of important clarity there.
[98.60 → 99.00] Discontinued.
[99.00 → 99.52] Yes.
[100.26 → 102.22] They continued to discontinue.
[102.22 → 131.40] The show is brought to you by
[131.40 → 136.22] Oh crap, my brain does not turn on this early in the morning
[136.22 → 138.70] And it's brought to you by
[138.70 → 142.44] Squarespace, Messi, AMD, and Green

[151.72 → 155.96] Our Brand partner Rap
[155.96 → 156.72] Listen
[156.72 → 159.20] Did we
[159.20 → 160.64] Yo, yo
[160.64 → 161.78] Brand
[161.78 → 166.46] Did we continue having our rap partner Brand
[166.46 → 167.58] Protect your laptop
[167.58 → 169.94] Don't let it be a crap top
[169.94 → 172.32] Oh my god
[172.32 → 175.92] Watch me go flip flap top
[175.92 → 176.62] Oh
[176.62 → 178.66] Flap top?
[178.90 → 180.64] Yeah, but you just rhymed top with top
[181.48 → 184.24] You did laptop and flap top
[184.24 → 189.06] I've heard far more egregious non-rhymes in actual professional music, sir
[189.06 → 190.06] Fair enough
[190.06 → 191.86] It has happened, I guess
[191.86 → 195.42] Yo
[195.42 → 196.50] Yo
[196.50 → 200.32] No
[200.32 → 201.72] Okay, sure

[347.30 → 347.38] What?
[347.38 → 347.50] What?
[347.50 → 348.30] What?
[350.16 → 350.64] What?
[353.64 → 354.66] Sorry I just
[354.66 → 356.68] I tried to go through the flow
[356.68 → 357.66] And was just like
[357.66 → 358.08] Uh
[358.08 → 359.10] Yeah
[359.10 → 361.38] Cool
[361.38 → 363.04] No work
[363.04 → 364.54] Anna's archive
[364.54 → 365.60] Has scraped and downloaded
[365.60 → 367.74] 256 million rows of metadata
[367.74 → 371.20] And 86 million audio files
[371.20 → 371.80] From Spotify
[371.80 → 375.22] Totalling around 300 terabytes of data
[375.22 → 376.34] Anna's archive
[376.34 → 381.94] typically aggregates print media links for books and papers and provides searchable results in its
[381.94 → 386.62] mission of preserving humanity's knowledge and culture and his archive has been blocked in many
[386.62 → 392.66] countries and has had hundreds of millions of URL takedown requests filed with Google the 86
[392.66 → 400.84] million audio tracks that's me are composed of 160 kilobits per second quality for popular songs
[400.84 → 409.28] and it drops to 75 kilobits per second for less listened tracks I am muted now these tracks
[409.28 → 418.40] represent 99.6 percent of listens on Spotify that's crazy wow they state this Spotify scrape is our
[418.40 → 424.60] humble attempt to start such a preservation archive for music of course Spotify doesn't have all the
[424.60 → 429.98] music in the world, but it's a great start they will be releasing the data on their torrents page in
[429.98 → 435.76] different stages with the metadata already released then the music files will be dropped in order of
[435.76 → 441.54] popularity followed by additional file metadata and album art they also state on their blog for now
[441.54 → 446.44] this is a torrent only archive aimed at preservation but if there is enough interest we could add
[446.44 → 452.32] downloading of individual files to Anna's archive please let us know if you would like this Spotify
[452.32 → 457.30] later responded saying they have identified and disabled the accounts that were scraping the data
[457.30 → 462.52] they state since day one we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively
[462.52 → 467.64] working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights um
[467.64 → 479.14] all right, so this seems you know what let's have the conversation we were having pre-show
[479.14 → 488.18] oh boy Luke has a theory that um that I think is an interesting theory and let's not get too deep into
[488.18 → 495.86] the granularity necessarily of it okay but Luke basically presented that he wasn't sure that people
[495.86 → 503.16] would be as yo ho ho are you know about this and I don't think they have been I would put that out
[503.16 → 508.42] there as they necessarily have been about other things and I just want to do like kind of a vibe check
[508.42 → 515.24] with the community basically I'll lay out sort of the bones of Luke's theory and then we can
[515.24 → 521.34] shiver me them timbers bury them six feet under, or we can, or we can keep talking about it but
[521.34 → 528.12] basically what he said was like there seems to be a sliding scale of acceptance like yeah like a pecking
[528.12 → 537.62] order of what's very okay to pirate versus what's not very okay to pirate TV shows seem to be very okay
[537.62 → 544.84] to pirate among sort of like you know the internet community sure um books seem to be
[544.84 → 551.54] surprisingly okay thoughtlessly no one cares pirated with no cares given um you know
[551.54 → 559.68] websites with paywalls seem to get treated as just like that was um just an obstacle that was in
[559.68 → 565.06] the way of my god-given right to view the website so they seem to be like on the highest level of
[565.06 → 573.18] acceptance for that but then audio over and this is a funny thing because in the early
[573.18 → 580.56] tormenting days when it was when we called it Napster audio was like most of it audio was most of it
[580.56 → 585.80] yeah and that was mostly because just the internet wasn't really fast enough to meaningfully pirate
[585.80 → 595.04] movies and TV shows and also streaming sites didn't really exist um encoding technology wasn't
[595.04 → 601.48] as awesome like you couldn't get great quality at an at an amount of you know bandwidth that was
[601.48 → 606.76] reasonable for you to actually download like it just you know video media just wasn't really feasible
[606.76 → 612.00] at that time um but like what are your guy's what are your guy's take on this oh right so
[612.00 → 616.26] where I was going with that was but audio ever since I mean realistically
[616.26 → 625.62] ever since the all-you-can-eat subscription model came to music I would say that music piracy while
[625.62 → 630.14] maybe it's not deemed more acceptable than before it's certainly fallen out of vogue
[630.14 → 638.72] yeah and i I will say that to counter my theory being more correct um I suspect one of the reasons
[638.72 → 644.56] why there hasn't been as big of an explosion about this um and as archive music thing as maybe there
[644.56 → 651.40] could have been is because a lot of people are subscribed to something YouTube premium which gives
[651.40 → 658.56] them YouTube music or Spotify or I don't know I'm assuming there's an apple thing or title or whatever
[658.56 → 663.04] um so they already have a subscription service that has practically everything so they just don't really
[663.04 → 670.04] like care that this archive is out there as much lion cat also brings up um trying to buy TV shows and
[670.04 → 675.70] movies is really hard in digital formats that I don't have restrictions on whereas buying music
[675.70 → 683.84] with zero DRM is easy and fairly cheap so that sort of is it um i I believe so I mean i have mp3s
[683.84 → 689.10] that I bought on iTunes like 15 years ago that I could totally just copy thing because that's the only
[689.10 → 694.28] way I don't know I don't know I don't know uh a couple artists that I've wanted to directly support
[694.28 → 701.12] so I've literally just like bought their thing and like I don't even know if it ever showed up it is
[701.12 → 707.90] like never the point right i just yeah but in a lot of cases if you're not an iTunes person
[707.90 → 713.76] band camp is that they do
[713.76 → 722.76] uh sure has an interesting take here and to be clear I'm not I'm not backing any of these comments
[722.76 → 727.32] from float plane chat that I'm reading I'm just kind of reading them out because they're different from
[727.32 → 734.00] each other uh sure says AI companies can scrape everything in existence um I accept that everything
[734.00 → 741.56] is okay to pirate until AI companies with pirated data are um gone after essentially um
[741.56 → 747.62] that's interesting willing spy says if I cross the line I'm going to cross the line
[747.62 → 758.48] I won't have any reservations so okay that's uh that's interesting it doesn't feel like band camp is
[758.48 → 763.56] truly a solution in my view I'm looking up a few different uh
[763.56 → 773.40] things Dan vibes in float plane chat not to be confused with producer Dan um says I'm a DJ
[773.40 → 780.80] I am also subscribed to official DJ libraries but for personal use I use certain YouTube downloaders
[780.80 → 787.38] so they so Dan vibes draws the line between commercial use and personal use that's an
[787.38 → 796.30] interesting line that is I think it's a semi-common line yeah yeah no i can see that um
[796.30 → 801.48] save I have no problem paying a certain amount of money for a single movie or TV show
[801.48 → 806.56] but all of them want subscriptions that drives me crazy I watch like one movie a month
[806.56 → 819.10] stone monarch says I only pirate music because even if I pay for it, it gets removed I mean I think
[819.10 → 824.18] that's a bit of a rationalization stone monarch there's a there's a lot of music that doesn't
[824.18 → 830.48] get removed from subscription services I don't I don't think there's been like a mass removing event
[830.48 → 836.68] there certainly have been things that have been removed and that certainly is uh is a major downer
[836.68 → 846.12] i am like actively trying to buy a digital version of a particular album and I am not succeeding
[846.12 → 853.66] uh seriously a blink 182 album this I tried to make it a low-hanging fruit that hard um a digital
[853.66 → 858.46] version yeah it doesn't seem to be the easiest thing ever is this physical or digital
[858.46 → 868.16] audio CD nice solid literally, literally solid it's solid the one on their actual store is a LP
[868.16 → 874.06] I looked up blink 182 on band camp right, and they only have one album, and it's Buddha which is like
[874.06 → 882.94] I don't think most people know that that album exists uh this is not like the easiest thing ever
[882.94 → 886.54] um
[888.46 → 898.10] if i yeah yeah there's a website where I can find listings for it in CD vinyl and cassette forms
[898.10 → 905.98] but I can't find a digital version people are saying a couple random websites I'll try this one
[905.98 → 909.62] if this website is legit I'd really hope that it would come up in a search
[909.62 → 920.48] this is music streaming yeah okay download store okay I'll check I'll check so is the issue a service
[920.48 → 931.14] issue again oh wow float plane chat is uh is super active right now about this definitely a lot
[931.14 → 937.08] of opinions Ben 34 says I feel a lot less guilty pirating something if I support the person actively
[937.08 → 941.76] on social media I feel this is fine what do you think what does that mean well it depends what you
[941.76 → 948.50] mean by supporting if like you press thumbs up once in a while on one of their uh you know tweets
[948.50 → 956.38] I would say that um that does not count well listen my whole thing with piracy right is
[956.38 → 964.00] I've always said your own line here's the impact you're going to draw your own line um what I can say
[964.00 → 971.52] is that the amount of money they would have made from you not pirating their stuff is substantially
[971.52 → 978.62] maybe even infinitely higher than what they're going to make from your pressing thumbs up once in a while
[978.62 → 987.36] um so you know if you're trying to if you're trying to find like a monetary support rationale
[987.36 → 994.46] then that's definitely not equivalent however you know if you're is you're drawing the line some other
[994.46 → 1001.56] way then you know that's that's your line to draw but I would say they're not the same thing um
[1001.56 → 1007.14] minor skills says I mean half the movies and shows I want to watch are not available anymore at all
[1007.14 → 1014.52] not in my country etc that's a that's a major one is like the whole regional licensing massive locks
[1014.52 → 1020.18] thing I think that's a huge driver for piracy there's a lot of this is one of the reasons why
[1020.18 → 1025.62] I basically refuse to subscribe to any of those services is somewhat in line with the person who
[1025.62 → 1032.26] said oh i I might subscribe for a certain thing of music, and then it's gone that's much more real
[1032.26 → 1036.66] in my opinion on the movies and TV shows side of things yeah where you subscribe to a service
[1036.66 → 1043.58] and then I don't know the show some of the shows that you might have wanted might just disappear
[1043.58 → 1049.58] that's happened many times with things like Netflix clapped k24 accord says I'll gladly buy a concert
[1049.58 → 1054.96] shirt when I'm seeing artists perform live if you aren't good enough for me to see live I don't feel
[1054.96 → 1061.48] the need to directly support you and then goes on to completely obliterate their own argument saying
[1061.48 → 1066.10] only exception is The Tragically Hip and other bands where members have died and disbanded
[1066.10 → 1073.94] right exactly or uh members where live performances are not practical because uh you know they do a
[1073.94 → 1079.34] lot of post-processing on their music and that you know is not conducive to performing live or
[1079.34 → 1083.40] maybe they have a health condition that makes it so that they can't perform live or
[1083.40 → 1091.44] uh you know there's an i I think that's um I think that again not taking a stance on your stance
[1091.44 → 1097.50] but you took a stance on your stance you said this is my line by the way here's a giant hole
[1097.50 → 1107.24] in the line that i drew um and that that was on you who did that not me um music's good on shuffle
[1107.24 → 1110.92] videos are more yeah wow this is really, really interesting
[1110.92 → 1121.16] okay the outlier says I pirate music videos and movies however videos I have a Spotify account
[1121.16 → 1127.72] for actually listening to music and an offline backup in case it gets taken down see like on a
[1127.72 → 1132.08] personal level i kind of like that I buy Blu-rays vinyls of content I love and I go and see many
[1132.08 → 1138.08] live shows and go to the theatres regularly so you are the outlier aren't you it's literally their
[1138.08 → 1146.56] username the outlier oh yeah, yeah okay I mean yeah it's its it is very interesting to see
[1146.56 → 1155.54] how easy it was for any time I've ever talked about piracy for it to tick off a large percentage
[1155.54 → 1160.34] of the audience because reading through these comments and the conversations like this is about
[1160.34 → 1167.46] the fastest I think I can remember seeing float plane chat moving yeah everybody has drawn
[1168.42 → 1175.78] not just like a line on a linear scale for like how much piracy is okay because there's all the
[1175.78 → 1182.90] different ways of pirating praying there's all the different mediums that you can pirate there's
[1182.90 → 1189.38] all the different definitions of piracy I mean there are a lot of folks myself included who feel
[1189.38 → 1198.58] that piracy is circumvention of the of the payment of a media good like to me that was
[1198.58 → 1205.14] always kind of what it fundamentally boiled down to there are clearly folks who do not agree uh to them
[1205.14 → 1213.30] piracy requires it to be illegal explicitly um that was and I believe that is actually like
[1213.30 → 1218.58] dictionary definition yeah correct I think that's the reason why you switched to calling it privateering
[1218.58 → 1224.66] yes so it's like this whole it becomes like a whole spirit versus letter of the law sort of argument at
[1224.66 → 1234.02] that point which again to me has always been you know sort of um sort of arbitrary um but to a lot of
[1234.02 → 1238.42] people is a very important line that they draw for their own personal morality so that they don't
[1238.42 → 1247.54] have to wear a tricorn hat um or something but yeah it's clear it's clear that you all are um okay man
[1247.54 → 1256.66] I keep getting new takes here Dixie your face goes I'd never pirate fiction but non-fictional educational
[1256.66 → 1263.62] pretty much always I think that's also a pretty common line to be honest also really yeah I think so I mean
[1263.62 → 1269.62] explain it to me um when you're on dude when you're on university campuses the hats are on
[1270.26 → 1275.06] yeah sure the hats are firmly positioned was I just a little bit on the older side because digital
[1275.06 → 1280.26] textbooks was not as much of a thing when I was in my first couple years barely creaking into being a
[1280.26 → 1285.38] thing when I was going to school I bought all my textbooks used people were that was a thing about
[1285.38 → 1292.42] it and then I resold them um in some cases i definitely honestly do agree there are
[1293.06 → 1300.74] a lot of documented counts where people are bumping revisions of books for
[1300.74 → 1306.42] practically nothing uh where the author of the book is the teacher of the class and then bumping
[1306.42 → 1313.38] revisions to make you buy new ones and like all this yep there's a lot of very obviously unfair play
[1313.38 → 1319.46] in the educational space, and you know it's still not legal for that whole line thing that we're talking
[1319.46 → 1324.66] about right but I can definitely understand why someone's line could be placed in a position where
[1324.66 → 1330.74] they're like I'm cool the pirate this I'm going to be okay with that because it's like you know you're
[1331.54 → 1340.34] you're spending a mind-shattering amount on getting a North American education uh and
[1341.94 → 1347.14] yeah 2024 study showed a huge number of students pirate books and also share them around
[1347.14 → 1351.30] totally makes sense that zero says there are even some university lecturers who will send an
[1351.30 → 1357.70] email out saying don't use these websites yep these this is a thing that has actually also
[1357.70 → 1363.14] happened many times to make it easier for them to find them yep like it's its uh it's tough because
[1363.14 → 1371.78] think of how many scenarios you are required to buy a book clapped k24 accord says I proudly pirated the
[1371.78 → 1376.82] Canadian electrical code if safety is that important I ain't paying 300 on it get wrecked
[1380.50 → 1382.74] yeah people have their own line right I don't know
[1384.82 → 1390.34] I could see there being certain educational books that I would feel terrible about pirating yeah and i
[1390.34 → 1397.94] could see there being certain educational books where I'd be like download like I don't know I think it
[1397.94 → 1405.62] really depends on the one specifically for me yeah and to me the biggest takeaway here is that
[1405.62 → 1412.58] literally no two people sitting next to each other in a room could possibly agree 100 on what's okay and
[1412.58 → 1419.46] what's not okay to pirate yeah unless they were absolutists unless they were literally Sith
[1419.46 → 1426.82] yeah, yeah only a Sith speaks in absolutes literally nothing is okay or literally everything else
[1426.82 → 1431.46] okay which there are people in both camps yeah there there are people absolutely I do
[1431.46 → 1435.94] wonder as many of them in this conversation right now in this chat, but there are people I do wonder
[1435.94 → 1443.46] if eventually you could poke a hole in most of those people's um belief system though simply by bringing
[1443.46 → 1449.94] it back around to something that they work on because it's amazing how quickly you can do that
[1449.94 → 1457.38] where you kind of go okay but what if they pirated you know this thing that you create you know
[1457.38 → 1460.58] what if somewhat is somebody didn't pay you for your work, and they'll be like
[1462.66 → 1469.06] obviously you know that's an exception because there's I know there's an oh I hope I don't misrepresent
[1469.06 → 1473.54] their argument but I know there's a group of people where it's all information should be free at all
[1473.54 → 1482.10] times and it just that's their line and they don't care if they make it or not make it yeah if
[1482.10 → 1490.10] they're creating information whatever that might be um oh i I do believe that for there are a
[1490.10 → 1496.90] significant number of people that actually walk that walk oh yeah but also most of the people who
[1496.90 → 1503.70] say they do i I have not found that they actually um do I know I've met people that do but I think i
[1503.70 → 1507.14] would agree with you on that one where a lot of people will hear that and be like oh that sounds
[1507.14 → 1512.18] cool and then not actually like really think about the consequences well there are definitely people
[1512.18 → 1516.74] that have thought about the consequences and are just like yup totally I'm going to contribute to open
[1516.74 → 1520.10] source stuff we're going to do all these other things I'm gonna I'm gonna absolutely walk this walk
[1520.10 → 1528.74] and it just it is what it is there a man oh how do we because like for software yeah you know
[1528.74 → 1536.26] open source is like the know the the the solution like uh but I don't I don't think there's like an
[1536.26 → 1544.02] open source you know music open source movies solution you kind of get where I'm where I'm going with
[1544.02 → 1549.14] this like if you were is you're someone who believes fundamentally that software should all be free
[1549.14 → 1554.10] then there's like there's a path so they're just to all software being free it's kind of it's been
[1554.10 → 1559.78] kind of laid out we just have to we have to do it whereas like movies I don't I don't think there's a
[1559.78 → 1565.30] path to movies being free I don't oh there's people that have started putting things up I know this
[1565.30 → 1570.26] this is a line that's going to get really interesting fast, but there's people that have been
[1570.26 → 1574.18] putting up people are saying oh yeah public libraries it's a good one creative commons but
[1574.18 → 1579.70] how do you distribute well I think who's going to make them that that's more the issue like with
[1579.70 → 1586.18] open source I think we've kind of solved the who's going to make it issue, and we've solved how they're
[1586.18 → 1591.86] going to get paid it's going to be through support contracts um so it's like major companies all right
[1591.86 → 1595.94] so that's how we're doing this and then but on the movie side who will make them and how will they
[1595.94 → 1600.18] be paid I don't I don't see yeah this isn't this is some people in chat are already saying
[1600.18 → 1603.78] the thing that I've been thinking about and this is going to become an interesting conversation fast
[1603.78 → 1610.50] like I just said previously uh but YouTube there's I don't remember it, but there's a YouTube documentary
[1610.50 → 1617.54] that went up and did really well um, and they got approached by a few different larger companies
[1618.50 → 1622.98] including Netflix and some other ones to take that documentary make it exclusive to their paid
[1622.98 → 1628.42] subscription platform, and they said no the reason why they said no was because they thought they would
[1628.42 → 1635.70] have better flexibility and potentially financials by staying on YouTube because i think it was
[1635.70 → 1644.82] Patreon interesting so it was crowdfunding what are we going to do how do you how do you start you have to
[1644.82 → 1655.22] you have to start in that realm by design like from the yeah it's tough, and it's and i and i do
[1655.22 → 1658.90] man there was a will people stay subscribed for the three years it takes you to make your next documentary
[1660.26 → 1666.58] that's tough it's very tough and will YouTube continue to and FAI to the point where
[1666.58 → 1673.30] it's its it's going to become a major problem like i um i came across a fascinating
[1673.30 → 1682.50] thread on the LTT Subreddit this week um just about how crap YouTube's getting and we actually we did this
[1682.50 → 1691.38] last week but i think it bears doing again this is my YouTube home page there is yeah an ad live stream
[1691.38 → 1699.30] live stream two live streams five shorts a row of shorts which like don't they don't even autoplay
[1699.30 → 1707.78] the whole thing they just stop you have to click them you have it's its by design you know it's by design
[1707.78 → 1720.50] then we get what another live stream and add a God the first God oh my god YouTube playable this ai slop
[1720.98 → 1730.42] garbage games so out of my first two pages so I'm below the fold already one
[1730.42 → 1736.58] one God, and it is i will say it is kind of somewhat based YouTube that the one God that you got is
[1736.58 → 1741.46] like a tiny video because part of YouTube is discoverability and all that kind of stuff, but it's
[1741.46 → 1746.50] it's one why is it why is it one okay let's keep going i mean i haven't I haven't prepped this right
[1747.46 → 1754.90] below the fold again okay here we go a Boston Dynamics video that's pretty popular Jurassic Park but with a
[1754.90 → 1762.02] cat a short circuit video okay we got three gods another row of shorts another live stream another
[1762.02 → 1768.90] live stream another ad a 10-year-old video from what 13 years old but yeah sure who's counting we
[1768.90 → 1774.34] got electro boom in here okay so we get a few gods another live stream another fireplace please tell me
[1774.34 → 1778.34] that's not the same fireplace no it's a different fireplace sorry one second can we look at that video real
[1778.34 → 1785.30] quick Virginia traffic attorney Luke j Nichols dot MOV from 13 years ago i mean it's got four and a
[1785.30 → 1790.90] half million views oh it's an ad it must have been used as an ad this is he's just talking
[1790.90 → 1797.06] about his practice totally it must have so it's just an ad, and it like it probably was an ad at some
[1797.06 → 1804.34] point it probably isn't an ad anymore because there's no way yeah this is clearly not parody though this is an
[1804.34 → 1811.62] actual ad for Virginia traffic attorney Luke j Nichols dot MOV am I missing something here okay now I'm
[1811.62 → 1818.34] clicking it i must be missing something here i don't know how i found this video but i didn't expect to
[1818.34 → 1823.78] see outdoor boys your new job is way cooler than a traffic attorney wait that's outdoor boys okay that
[1823.78 → 1830.74] makes sense why they got so many views that is totally him what the heck okay got it i didn't recognize
[1830.74 → 1838.10] a name immediately that is incredibly random hilarious so what happens if i call this number
[1838.74 → 1843.30] you know what let's not do that yeah that's not necessary we're not that kind of show but so
[1844.66 → 1849.70] how much farther and this was sort of the conversation that some people were trying to have in the
[1849.70 → 1858.82] Reddit thread but like how much more in is there for YouTube to go through i mean i do feel like
[1858.82 → 1865.22] this whole AI slop game thing might be the jump the shark moment it feels like it to me
[1866.10 → 1871.94] i think i ranted about this last week but yeah YouTube really needs to find their way I'm i am
[1873.22 → 1879.78] genuinely rather terrified because that was the answer right like that was the communities and your
[1879.78 → 1885.38] answer to how we're gonna not have everything be major studio funded, and we're going to have like indie be
[1885.38 → 1893.94] possible the answer is YouTube has been the bastion yes they've been the way for small projects to
[1893.94 → 1899.78] survive and fund themselves you know of platform on Patreon or even through YouTube directly
[1900.66 → 1910.58] but how is Vaud supposed to survive on YouTube when literally AI slop games are given better billing
[1910.58 → 1918.02] in the first two pages of the site then significantly better than Vaud videos yeah I'm going to say Vaud
[1918.58 → 1923.62] i don't mean that you know a lot of this other stuff isn't also technically video on demand
[1923.62 → 1931.22] but that's the way that YouTube refers to it is there are shorts there's gods there's live um so Vaud
[1931.22 → 1937.54] that's like your traditional you know 16 by 9 YouTube upload that's meant to be watched on a screen
[1937.54 → 1945.94] that isn't vertical um and isn't meant to be like you know played a game on with AI slop junk
[1948.90 → 1954.02] and i don't know and obviously this you know affects me personally right because that's the
[1954.02 → 1962.42] majority of Linus media groups work is Vaud and even though we do dabble in shorts um i can tell you
[1962.42 → 1967.78] now that unless you're selling something through your shorts there's not there's not a sustainable
[1967.78 → 1973.06] amount of money to be made not at any kind of scale like i think as an individual person you could
[1973.06 → 1978.02] survive on shorts just kind of filming yourself or maybe even a couple of people a few people small team
[1978.02 → 1982.82] but beyond that you're going to need to start to seek sponsorships you're going to need to start to
[1982.82 → 1989.86] sell something um ran into a really cool shorts' creator who became a shorts' creator because of his
[1989.86 → 1995.30] like frozen desert business as opposed to yeah there's a bunch of way around it's weird but yeah
[1995.30 → 2003.30] yeah yeah um we're like the ads we've the ads have become the content which is sort of wild oh that
[2003.30 → 2008.10] part's very interesting um hey i think people i think there's some people out there who would make
[2008.10 → 2014.02] the same argument about us yep it's its that's again where your line is because some people see
[2014.02 → 2022.66] certain types of content as ads it also depends on their necessarily perception right um like there
[2022.66 → 2029.86] is stuff that we do that i would say classify it could be classified as advertisement um like
[2029.86 → 2034.50] like fully like we did a fully sponsored short on these like wave generator things we just put them
[2034.50 → 2038.98] in my hot tub and turned it into a whirlpool yeah no i mean we do it's actually really a fair amount of
[2038.98 → 2042.82] things that are effectively ads we try to make them entertaining, but they're effectively
[2042.82 → 2047.22] yeah, but there's a lot of people who consider like you know anything that we do building a
[2047.22 → 2052.42] computer to be an ad simply because those are things you can buy, and it's like well no that's
[2052.42 → 2055.62] not actually how that works either the line gets funky um
[2060.18 → 2065.06] all right it's tough but my like I'm terrified for what's happening to YouTube thing actually has
[2065.06 → 2072.58] nothing to do with like my job or this place it's entirely just that like i don't know there's
[2072.58 → 2076.58] comments in flow plane chat of like oh YouTube YouTube can definitely i can't remember where it
[2076.58 → 2081.06] was I'm not going to find it sorry but YouTube can definitely get worse they've proven that before
[2082.02 → 2087.06] um it's like yeah man i don't know I'm definitely on the like let's dog on YouTube chain i guess
[2087.54 → 2094.18] um yeah but like i mean it's also pretty amazing and yeah there really isn't anything else there
[2094.74 → 2099.78] out there like it and i really don't think it's going to happen if YouTube goes down we're not going to get this
[2099.78 → 2106.66] back again you look at the incumbents what are they doing yeah just worse things than what YouTube's
[2106.66 → 2113.38] doing yeah and that's and that was with YouTube to be there as a guiding star and show them how to
[2113.38 → 2119.54] create a creator economy company like twitter talked a good game for a while about you know uh
[2120.66 → 2126.50] more revenue sharing with creators and yeah and this and that and then i think eventually their
[2126.50 → 2135.54] leadership figured out or that that's not happening or got distracted by something um ticktock i don't
[2135.54 → 2143.06] think bite dance has any intention of ever having a revenue sharing model like YouTube introduced
[2143.62 → 2150.58] um twitch has revenue sharing like pretty, pretty decent revenue sharing I'd say that's like the other
[2150.58 → 2158.10] platform where creators can realistically like to make enough money to sustain teams to build companies
[2158.10 → 2161.78] like come on are we gonna they're still not profitable twitch being better than YouTube in
[2161.78 → 2169.06] 2026 oh no, but this is my point though like, and they've abandoned Maude so Maude is pretty functionally
[2169.06 → 2176.58] completely abandoned on twitch um I've I've had people who don't understand what float plane is
[2176.58 → 2184.26] um say oh this is floated planes opportunity no it isn't we're not doing that it's not happening
[2184.26 → 2190.98] that will literally never happen it will never ever happen the only reason that YouTube works is because
[2190.98 → 2199.30] it operates at such a colossal scale that no amount of you know what float plane team super talented
[2200.02 → 2205.54] amazing floating leadership great job thanks man Peter's in Peter's in full plane chat right now saying
[2205.54 → 2213.46] yeah please no yeah we're good we're not doing that but a project of that scale no matter how I will
[2213.46 → 2219.86] say it right now and I don't mean this to be offensive to the float plane team in any way no, no amount
[2219.86 → 2226.50] of venture capital money would make that viable, but that has been proven already like if anyone was going
[2226.50 → 2233.86] to do if it was basically going to be Amazon yeah with adding Maude to twitch and then yeah they don't
[2233.86 → 2238.74] work there any more it's probably fine I'm not going to name them but I have talked to twitch people who
[2238.74 → 2246.18] during that segment of time were like we are going to lose we were never going to win this is a failed
[2246.18 → 2252.98] idea their moat is astronomically bigger than everyone thinks and no one will ever touch YouTube and that
[2252.98 → 2260.02] like almost it's been too many years to say that verbatim but like it's close like they there 's's no
[2260.02 → 2265.46] chance and that's still kind of true unless they remove the moat themselves
[2267.62 → 2273.22] the only real they're working on it, they're cooking inside the building and my concern is
[2273.22 → 2277.70] that threat inside the building is too much you sound scared I am kind of scared the the the like
[2278.82 → 2288.82] the future of online knowledge sharing with YouTube rotten to its core is dark like i you look at like
[2288.82 → 2294.58] so many different ways and there's some there's people talking about how they're they're uh stopping
[2294.58 → 2298.42] using social media and all these different things are happening and like there 's's goodness in
[2298.42 → 2304.74] that, but the sad part of that is that YouTube was often take that
[2307.22 → 2312.10] dear god the call is coming from inside the house
[2312.10 → 2318.02] because YouTube threat from within yeah it was pretty good it was pretty good I'm so confused
[2318.02 → 2326.66] looking at my phone I was like did you get spoofed or something um uh yeah like it's
[2328.42 → 2335.62] okay all right gravity cube asks it's just concerning but why is it not feasible I understand money but
[2335.62 → 2342.50] what is the part that is so expensive okay so uploading for free is
[2343.46 → 2350.90] f***ING insane for one thing that's that's the start like the whole uploading for free only made sense
[2350.90 → 2361.38] at the beginning because investment funding burning money user acquisition period it was the mid 2000s
[2361.38 → 2371.22] slash sort of late 2000s and i mean even well into the 2010s that was the Silicon Valley model you just
[2371.22 → 2379.06] burned investor money, and then you acquired many many users and then usually you exited to a much
[2379.06 → 2389.78] larger company who figured out how to make money off of it eventually or just kind of um didn't and continued to burn money and just acquire users
[2389.78 → 2403.78] see twitch as an example um that was just the model but what happened to the vast majority of other you know free to use free to upload free to download services
[2404.34 → 2413.62] like uh you know let's let's look at Dropbox as an example uh Dropbox you know made no sense how much they were giving away for free in the early days
[2413.62 → 2421.06] eventually they had to look at it and go oh my god this doesn't make any sense, and they had to build like a viable
[2421.62 → 2428.02] business model yeah and now Dropbox's popularity is i they were like dude they were like
[2428.50 → 2434.98] basically everywhere the yeah cloud storage yeah at the time you know in the early days, and now it's like yeah
[2434.98 → 2441.62] Dropbox I don't know what did you fail to pay do you know did you get cut off
[2441.62 → 2449.30] by let's see you know google one it is uh one drive interesting that their I cloud their tagline is
[2450.26 → 2452.34] registered users you better believe it
[2455.22 → 2465.62] um so like that whole model never made any sense except YouTube YouTube has somehow
[2465.62 → 2470.74] has somehow made it work so we would have to find a way and and and the somehow right is they got bought
[2470.74 → 2478.98] by google who continued to throw money into the money furnace until such point as they were able to
[2478.98 → 2487.38] extract enough data that they were able to leverage it to make enough on that data that they were able to
[2487.38 → 2499.78] to turn it into a self-sustaining machine um without the deep deep ad
[2500.58 → 2509.30] business that google has without the way that they leverage user data to make money in their advertising business
[2509.30 → 2516.98] business I just don't see how it could be done, and you can look at other examples of strong
[2516.98 → 2521.54] advertising companies I'd say Facebook would probably be the closest thing at this point meta
[2522.10 → 2525.22] um meta tried and
[2527.22 → 2534.58] i I don't think Vaud has ever really taken off on meta short form they have a lot for sure, but meta's model is
[2534.58 → 2543.86] also so different like you, I know like literally one creator that does well on Facebook Vaud and
[2543.86 → 2549.22] I know there are some other creators that do they have some demographics, but it's really it's not YouTube
[2549.22 → 2554.58] and it's very very very far from being YouTube and then the other side of it so google figured out how to
[2554.58 → 2560.82] bring in enough revenue to make it make sense, but then they also had to figure out how to scale up their
[2560.82 → 2566.82] infrastructure to make it affordable and I don't know if you guys have noticed this but Moore's law
[2567.38 → 2576.42] and like the way that storage uh you know costs per terabyte uh are going like it, you can't just count
[2576.42 → 2583.30] on your next data centre to be twice as fast have twice as much storage and cost half as much as the
[2583.30 → 2592.74] last one you built anymore the large scale corporate entities are up against the exact same
[2592.74 → 2599.78] challenges that we are when we go to build a new gaming pc and realize oh my god this thing like
[2599.78 → 2606.50] costs the same or more is not that much faster than my old one you know what maybe I'll just keep my
[2606.50 → 2611.46] five-year-old gaming pc because realistically a five-year-old gaming pc today is still going to play
[2611.46 → 2618.50] anything you'd want to play, and you have it already you don't have to you don't have to buy a new one
[2618.50 → 2623.94] I mean they have oh man they have when you're operating at that scale your power and you're cooling
[2623.94 → 2628.82] become major concerns, and you might have to upgrade just from like an efficiency standpoint but in terms
[2628.82 → 2635.46] of like performance and especially storage we did a video a while back that was um I forget exactly
[2635.46 → 2643.30] what we called it, but it basically laid out the case for why um oh what was it YouTube made a
[2643.30 → 2650.50] made a controversial move it was something to do with YouTube premium is this the skip ad thing no i
[2650.50 → 2655.38] think it was like the resolution I think it was the resolution thing like why 4k should be a premium
[2655.38 → 2659.94] feature or something like that yeah, thank you that sounds about right in float plane chat where we basically
[2659.94 → 2670.42] showed how the cost per gig of storage used to go down very rapidly god rapidly and then
[2670.42 → 2679.94] just like stopped yeah and meanwhile more and more people are carrying around 4k video cameras in their
[2679.94 → 2686.26] pockets all while the storage doesn't get cheaper the way that it used to so the only way to make it
[2686.26 → 2694.02] affordable is to just what I don't know there's no magic it's not like google gets magic hard drives that don't cost money
[2695.62 → 2699.30] yeah, so apparently the answer is
[2702.10 → 2702.42] this
[2711.14 → 2716.10] all right oh my god now that I've watched one video yeah now
[2716.10 → 2719.86] now oh wow this is crazy amazing um
[2721.70 → 2721.94] huh
[2725.14 → 2726.18] YouTube playable
[2727.38 → 2736.82] wow I'm sure glad this exists 48 million plays with that said I don't know you know no one has ever known
[2737.46 → 2744.26] what this number means yeah we all kind of trust YouTube to be somewhat consistent in their application of
[2744.26 → 2753.62] that number whether it's views or streams or plays um but i I actually emailed them uh to my rep the
[2753.62 → 2764.18] other day that i you know I was really confused by let me see if I can find it yeah here it is so let me let
[2764.18 → 2776.50] me fire this uh let me fire this over to you Dan um share nice noise oh my god where is teams in my share
[2776.50 → 2782.50] menu why is it not here oh they changed the icon recently that's right there it is just once why would
[2782.50 → 2788.98] I want to always share to the same app which is stupid interface thing i I'm finally
[2789.54 → 2796.10] dairying the fold seven just in time for the trifold to come out and I absolutely love it so far uh
[2796.10 → 2804.90] it definitely has some issues, but it's pretty awesome god this is terrible what's up maybe it's
[2804.90 → 2810.90] better on a phone I'm trying to play one of these I'm trying to play that game that had 48 million plays
[2812.10 → 2818.66] oh here sure oh it's like so all of your movement it's interesting this works on YouTube but all of
[2818.66 → 2823.78] your movement is I see my mouse there's this like touchpad spot which is it meaning you know it's almost
[2823.78 → 2829.94] certainly just made for a mobile phone so that's probably a big part of the problem but I am a
[2830.90 → 2838.34] unhearable ninja as far as I can tell I get cash immediately this probably counts as another play
[2838.34 → 2847.30] clicking next level oh yeah yeah probably I can get firearms I don't have enough money for any of this
[2847.30 → 2853.38] cool good game design um so they can't hear me so I just walk near them, and they get shanked
[2853.38 → 2856.90] even if they see me for a second doesn't really matter I could probably just speed run all this
[2856.90 → 2864.50] by just running into them wow I did it this is the game why has this been played 48 million times
[2864.50 → 2868.18] I do suspect it's because every single time you load a level it's probably counting as the game being
[2868.18 → 2874.42] played again well that's the thing is like how do things count do do do do do do do do
[2874.42 → 2881.86] I have to care about anything no all right sweet okay I think that's probably enough of that sure
[2881.86 → 2890.02] is so i sent this screenshot yep go ahead Dan over to my YouTube rep and I was basically like okay
[2890.02 → 2896.66] I'm trying to understand what's going on here it seems like this brand is buying views against this video
[2896.66 → 2903.78] um so you can actually see it on the left there that's my left circle I hadn't switched to a
[2903.78 → 2908.50] fold phone yet so this was the interface I was dealing with and I wanted to send just one screenshot
[2908.50 → 2915.70] um because I don't know whatever I did so on the left you can see the stair step of where the brand
[2915.70 → 2924.42] like ran an advertising campaign to buy views for this video right yeah so it got a lot of views
[2924.42 → 2937.46] views, but you can see the watch time is relatively tanked basically negligible like not just
[2937.46 → 2945.38] doesn't track in lockstep with the views because I would fully expect that a purchased view a viewer
[2945.38 → 2950.82] might not stick around for as long right as someone who they might stick around for five seconds comes
[2950.82 → 2961.22] across the content organically right oh okay well she should message me then I didn't get a message
[2961.22 → 2974.10] from her uh sorry to interrupt yeah yeah no all good okay um or well okay no oh right right
[2974.10 → 2980.34] no I know how that one works I can just send that to her um okay fine I'm doing it I'm I'm doing it
[2980.34 → 2989.70] I'm doing it now uh yeah no she did not message me so I don't know there I've sent it um
[2990.34 → 2996.90] so basically my so my question to the YouTube rep was like look I understand that how a view is counted
[2996.90 → 3003.78] is sort of the secret sauce YouTube doesn't share the criteria um but is it maybe possible for me to
[3003.78 → 3010.66] at least understand how something like this can happen curiously there's been a small uptick in
[3010.66 → 3019.06] subscribers that seem to correspond to the the the campaign that's being run really how do you get
[3019.06 → 3026.42] new views new subscribers but functionally zero new watch time
[3029.70 → 3033.62] hi Linus just getting back to you um
[3034.90 → 3039.30] yep since they're running it as an ad it's not surprising people would be watching for far shorter
[3039.30 → 3047.14] than usual yeah and I said yeah I get that I'm just wondering why that quality you can take it away
[3047.14 → 3054.90] down why that quality as a view it would seem like um you know organically if people were finding this
[3054.90 → 3061.78] organically you know a three-second view or a five-second view probably wouldn't count as a view
[3061.78 → 3072.10] I have no answer on that um but what is very clear to me is that view like doesn't necessarily have a set
[3072.10 → 3080.42] definition because I cannot, I don't think I've ever in my 18 years of uploading to YouTube
[3081.06 → 3086.82] ever seen a video that's very strange that tracked that far off for watch time and for views
[3088.18 → 3095.14] which is clearly just people clicking skip ad clearly yeah like very clearly yeah but at the end of the
[3095.14 → 3098.50] day right I noticed this as well by the way I was trying to talk to somebody about
[3099.14 → 3105.22] how viewership on YouTube is like mind-blowing spiky these days and how sometimes it's kind of
[3105.22 → 3108.74] surprising because I thought that video was pretty good and I went to bring up that video as an
[3108.74 → 3113.70] example and I was like whoa oh because I was trying to point out that it had lower than views than i
[3113.70 → 3118.18] would expect and I was like what the heck so I went on this huge tangent where I was like bring up the
[3118.18 → 3121.38] dashboard trying to figure out what the heck was going on and then I saw those charts and was just like
[3121.38 → 3127.62] like okay well it's pretty obvious what happened yeah, but nobody actually watched it except a few
[3127.62 → 3133.86] people did because they subscribed to the channel unless there's like whole bot networks snake eating
[3133.86 → 3140.50] its own tail kind of that are that that that will watch that will go out of their way to watch feel
[3140.50 → 3146.90] like it was and then subscribe, or something network views this feels like it was YouTube ad views oh that i
[3146.90 → 3151.78] that I don't know probably but no what I'm saying is no, no what if there's bot networks that are
[3151.78 → 3160.82] designed to to to watch the ad content oh and subscribe to it to seem like legitimate users so
[3160.82 → 3165.70] that those bot accounts can be reused later or whatever like I could yeah like they're just farming
[3165.70 → 3171.46] new bot accounts or something I look I don't piggyback on a system that exists to try to legitimize
[3171.46 → 3180.26] themselves in some way interesting um, and you know what it's not the most egregious sort of abuse of
[3180.26 → 3184.58] of of of metrics to make advertisers feel like they're getting something for their money that I've
[3184.58 → 3191.62] ever seen I remember my old boss at NCI not Tarzan not the owner of the company jack I remember him
[3191.62 → 3200.34] explaining to me how magazines and newspapers managed to sell their advertising for so much money, and it blew my
[3200.34 → 3206.82] mind at the time because you know to me a techie guy for whom one megahertz is one megahertz and nothing
[3206.82 → 3216.34] more nothing less right um to have something so emotional be sold and then bought by somebody was
[3216.34 → 3224.02] just inconceivable right, but he's like yeah so you have to understand that on the internet you know an ad
[3224.02 → 3230.98] view is an ad view by and large but with magazines um they would actually have like a multiplier
[3231.54 → 3236.90] so first they would assume that every single magazine that was sold to a person who
[3236.90 → 3241.38] viewed every single ad in it, but then they assume it's left on a coffee table or whatever else oh my god
[3241.38 → 3248.74] and I think the multiplier you know depending on the yeah depending on the the publication
[3248.74 → 3254.98] could be 2x or even 5x and these are just like assumptions that would be kind of like hidden in
[3254.98 → 3263.94] the in the footnotes of the sales deck, but that's wild yeah right to a certain limited degree sure
[3264.82 → 3269.22] but it's there's no way it's as high as they were saying no I mean there's no way it was even one
[3269.22 → 3273.70] yeah like if we're being real like what happened to an unsold magazine it didn't get
[3273.70 → 3278.98] read by three people come on also not every single thing in the entire magazine is read
[3279.54 → 3285.38] back when magazines were a thing it was very common to be like oh yeah I read front page and page eight
[3285.38 → 3293.62] and that's it every time I don't read anything else so I actually back in those days I didn't know that
[3293.62 → 3300.42] many people that would read the whole thing I don't think I knew anybody so anyway I mean there are
[3300.42 → 3309.46] certain magazines that the articles were the only thing that I was interested in for sure yes it's
[3309.46 → 3316.18] important to note as well everything else was unnecessary filler and i would sometimes
[3316.18 → 3321.22] there was filler on them and I would make sure I would check every page I would check every page
[3321.86 → 3328.34] to verify if it was in fact filler and I would look closely to be sure that I knew that it
[3328.34 → 3333.22] was certainly filler before I went past it more time on those pages verifying that they were filler yes
[3333.78 → 3334.02] yes
[3341.86 → 3352.58] anyway uh topic two the ram shortage oh is here to stay likely resulting in raised prices on pcs and phones
[3352.58 → 3360.82] uh yes, thank you international data corporation IDC for verifying what everyone else I think has known
[3360.82 → 3369.06] for a while um IDC market analysis finds that because memory makers like micron Samsung and SK Hynix
[3369.06 → 3373.06] are shifting supply to AI data centres stock is tightening for everyday devices and companies that
[3373.06 → 3379.38] compete on low price with budget products are getting hit hardest and are responding by raising prices or
[3379.38 → 3385.30] cutting features apple and Samsung have secured their supply early as if that's going to stop them
[3385.30 → 3392.42] from raising prices but pc makers like dell hp acer etc are already signalling price increases as memory
[3392.42 → 3401.62] costs climb um so yes it's another ram poppy ram apocalypse topic, but there are a couple of new things that um
[3401.62 → 3413.54] um oh that make this not like what we've seen before um so first something that we have seen before valve
[3413.54 → 3422.10] discontinued the least expensive steam deck this was the 400 LCD model that was sometimes on sale for as
[3422.10 → 3429.94] little as 350 dollars um it has been quietly discontinued and quietly all the remaining stock was
[3429.94 → 3439.78] snapped up so now the cheapest steam deck I believe is the uh the OLED hold on a second I'm trying to find it
[3439.78 → 3448.74] uh-oh my search here is not fine is it in the dock or oh yeah here it is so now the most affordable option
[3448.74 → 3454.82] is the 512 gig OLED version for 550 dollars
[3456.90 → 3469.30] oh man the steam deck was so the affordability of the steam deck was such a game changer like for pc gaming
[3470.02 → 3476.42] um and to be clear I have hope that affordable steam deck will return it's just that
[3476.42 → 3484.90] you can't do anything about your supplier cost yeah and I don't think it's fair I don't think valve
[3484.90 → 3491.94] wants to do this at all I don't think it's fair yeah exactly to be mad at valve over their incoming
[3492.82 → 3500.82] supply over their sourcing costs going up a lot and to be clear i I like to often point out their 30
[3500.82 → 3508.18] take and how they're not quite the benevolent gods that people say that they are pretty freaking cool
[3508.18 → 3514.58] they're quite a lot of ways often but the way that valve has approached gambling for instance uh the way
[3514.58 → 3524.02] that valve just kind of takes their take and um imperfect algorithmic etc and uh you know not standing up to
[3524.02 → 3528.50] payment processors around us just being allowed to spend our money however we like which should be the
[3528.50 → 3533.22] way that it works valve is not perfect however this is one of the ways that they've actually been
[3533.22 → 3537.86] super cool for a long time is they're really not they understand the model of we're going to sell you
[3537.86 → 3541.14] this thing, and it's going to have our store on it, and you're going to buy our games and that's great
[3541.14 → 3545.62] therefore the thing doesn't have to be too expensive um, and they've been keeping stuff like
[3545.62 → 3551.30] the steam deck like really cheap for a long time and I don't think there's a shift here where they're like
[3551.30 → 3557.30] oh ram prices are up we can loot people now no I don't think it's that way I'm for sure happening I'm
[3557.30 → 3562.82] I'm I'm for sure that's happening at some companies somewhere and I really don't think it's happening
[3562.82 → 3570.18] so basically we're not bootlicking valve we're just trying to make sure that our anger right now
[3570.82 → 3579.30] is directed at the correct sources we're gonna start having like fancy restaurant pricing for
[3579.30 → 3584.34] things where it just says like market price on everything and the market price is just dictated by ram
[3584.34 → 3588.58] I don't know I feel like that's something that I did not get across very well last week when I was
[3588.58 → 3594.90] trying to talk about the sort of perspective shift um a lot of the so that that whole conversation
[3594.90 → 3600.74] went up on leg clips and a lot of people were extremely mad about it in fairness i I did not
[3600.74 → 3607.62] open the conversation very tactfully yeah um but the point i was trying to if I can interject for a moment
[3607.62 → 3615.94] what you're referring to as tactless was in fact tactless plus i think part of the problem
[3615.94 → 3622.98] is that you script think out loud uh I've been thinking about this since you mentioned it before
[3622.98 → 3630.10] the show and I think that was Linus script thinking out loud which is where you kind of start with
[3630.10 → 3637.86] this dramatic position oh I see, and then you distill it, and you research it, and you message it into a
[3638.42 → 3644.26] well-thought-out argument that ends up being a script, and you script thunk out loud on Sancho and
[3644.26 → 3648.82] people were like oh a lot of people didn't watch that far into the clip I can tell you that much
[3648.82 → 3654.42] but basically what I was trying to get across and so a lot of the comments are about how like well
[3654.42 → 3659.46] you have to understand that like housing is way more expensive and health care is way more expensive we
[3659.46 → 3664.58] have a lot of American viewers and food is way more expensive and computers are way more
[3664.58 → 3671.30] expensive and I guess like what i was trying to get across last week is like if for the
[3671.30 → 3679.54] last I mean realistically the whole thing kind of goes back to sometime in the 70s when um when wages
[3679.54 → 3688.42] just completely decoupled from corporate earnings um because they track pretty close up until like 70s 80s yeah
[3688.42 → 3693.22] um I wonder what happened back then I don't know who knows no one knows um, but they track pretty
[3693.22 → 3699.70] close up until then, and then they just completely decoupled from each other and I guess the point
[3699.70 → 3708.02] that I was trying to make last week is like if you've been having the kicked out of you for 50 years by
[3708.02 → 3720.02] housing and food and shelter or sorry housing and food are um and utilities and essentials right now
[3720.02 → 3727.54] too energy prices are going through the roof and closing and then and then all that time gaming has
[3727.54 → 3736.02] been there for you with a full retail game being 60 dollars somehow in spite of everything else going
[3736.02 → 3745.14] like this and computers have been there for you like this while everything else has gone like this and
[3745.14 → 3751.54] flat screen TVs have been there for you like this while everything else has gone like this flat screens are
[3751.54 → 3760.26] still there for some reason somehow um I guess what I was trying to get across last week was that yes this ram
[3760.26 → 3769.78] pricing blip really sucks especially if you have to buy some ram right now but compared to the absolute
[3769.78 → 3775.30] beating that all of these other essentials have been dishing out um
[3775.30 → 3784.26] um they still hasn't even remotely kept up with how much everything else has gone up and
[3785.54 → 3792.90] it's it sucks, and especially the reason sucks like the fact that it's just so that we can have
[3793.70 → 3802.42] more AI that I don't think anyone especially in this community is really asking for yeah a massive
[3802.42 → 3808.50] amount of the output that I see from those systems is junk that no one wants so if we didn't just make
[3808.50 → 3815.78] all the junk that no one wants it you know this probably wouldn't be happening legitimately um so
[3815.78 → 3820.10] yeah i guess what I was trying to get across is like guys the fact that we can still buy
[3820.90 → 3829.38] a steam deck for 550 that's a lot worse than 400 which is how much we could buy it for a week ago
[3829.38 → 3838.50] for how much value and how much entertainment and how much we can extract from that steam deck for 550
[3840.58 → 3851.78] all I was trying to say is hey let's not be super mad at valve about this you can be you can be mad
[3851.78 → 3858.82] about the situation you should be mad about the situation like dude i was reading about uh how much
[3858.82 → 3867.38] the uh the big food lobby has engaged with the current administration to demand
[3868.58 → 3876.74] the good parts of the make America healthy again initiative oh really, and it's been like
[3876.74 → 3882.66] unprecedented they're all spending at rates that are like at least decade-long highs in some cases
[3882.66 → 3890.10] all-time highs to just demand all this stuff you should totally be mad you should be super mad
[3890.10 → 3895.38] right now there's so many there's honestly too many things to be mad about but I do feel like in some
[3895.38 → 3901.54] ways and this is what I was talking about with the perspective adjustment I feel like in some ways our
[3901.54 → 3911.30] passion for gaming and our passion for technology is making it so that we are more angry
[3911.30 → 3920.02] at this thing that with that we love than at the things that have actually been beating the
[3920.02 → 3929.06] out of us far more over a much longer period of time um and i I don't think I did a great job of
[3929.06 → 3934.10] explaining that but I was trying to i was trying to be I was trying to be more positive thinking I was
[3934.10 → 3942.34] trying to be a little more positive um, and you know what it's funny because there was a time probably
[3942.34 → 3952.82] about I don't know six seven years ago so i I'll stop it's so dead it's like so dead that's when it
[3952.82 → 3962.58] becomes fun I am that old guy did you just dab yeah nice okay I'm not even doing it properly there we go
[3962.58 → 3971.94] yeah see now it's fun now it's fun I can't, I can't even do it right but uh okay anyway there was
[3972.98 → 3976.90] somewhere between totally fake Arthur and whole plane chats mods banned them
[3979.46 → 3985.62] somewhere between five and eight years ago there you go there you go uh we were really leaning into
[3985.62 → 3993.38] more negativity in our content more like anger at the stagnation in like silicon improvements more
[3993.38 → 4001.06] rants and Yvonne actually kind of like sat me down and was like okay listen is that good for
[4001.06 → 4006.82] anybody does that help anybody does that help anybody get a better deal on their next computer
[4006.82 → 4014.58] based upon does that help anybody um you know feel more positive about the system that they're
[4014.58 → 4020.58] building to like play games like can you find a positive side and i kind of went okay
[4020.58 → 4028.02] yeah like i yeah i I think I can like excuse me the steam summer sale is still there for us, you know
[4028.66 → 4034.26] there are so many games that come out these days that do not have high system requirements and like i
[4034.26 → 4043.22] know i know that there's a large extremely vocal part of the community that is very angry about
[4043.22 → 4047.86] new games having high system requirements that can't be run without upscaling or frame generation
[4047.86 → 4055.06] or whatever else, and it's like whoa whoa whoa like you could probably count on your fingers and toes
[4055.06 → 4062.18] those releases whereas every week steam gets flooded with many games that are a lot of fun to play
[4062.98 → 4066.58] that you don't have to do any of that for you can play on a 10-year-old Linux computer it's a very
[4066.58 → 4072.34] interesting tone shift because of how much people liked crisis i know it's practically impossible to run
[4072.34 → 4078.02] and it was like fun trying to see if you could uh and stuff like that yeah but i just but but but
[4078.02 → 4085.30] okay you know what I think that is such a critical point that you've landed on there because why are
[4085.30 → 4091.94] people yelling at me over on leg clips why are people yelling at the way you frame your argument sucks
[4092.82 → 4098.10] no, no hold on okay, okay you know why are people yelling at game developers for building games
[4098.10 → 4103.46] that are super that demand the high the fastest computers why are people why are people angry at
[4103.46 → 4110.58] all of these at all these places that didn't create the problem well it's because of that passion that's
[4110.58 → 4117.62] exactly what I was talking about so, so back then they didn't have at least to the same degree that it's
[4117.62 → 4124.82] there now all these external stressors' oh yeah right that are impeding on their ability to it was so much
[4124.82 → 4131.30] easier to just live to splurge on a new GPU yeah or to or that could make it so you could aspire to one
[4131.30 → 4139.14] day owning a system that could run if it's the hopelessness that is actually caused by all these
[4139.14 → 4147.54] other factors I mean when was the last time on wan show okay think about it when was the last time
[4147.54 → 4158.34] we talked about a technology industry hiring wave who is our who is our audience yeah early it would
[4158.34 → 4163.94] have been early covet it happened would have been early covet i something that I think is interesting
[4163.94 → 4173.30] just on this topic we started this company in your garage yeah that was a normal thing for companies with
[4173.30 → 4182.42] very low amounts of money to do back then most people don't have garages anymore like that
[4182.42 → 4188.50] is if is now yeah that had been a privileged position yep which is nuts even then it was a
[4188.50 → 4196.58] privileged position I mean I remember Ivonne and I shopping for our house and pushing ourselves
[4196.58 → 4201.46] for a detached there are cheaper detached houses that have garages and that was with her
[4202.10 → 4208.02] well okay I mean yes but also not by as much as you might think we were already in the Burns
[4209.06 → 4216.02] we already it wasn't like a large house you can get I mean by those standards yeah it was older it was
[4216.02 → 4224.42] it was quite it was old when we bought it but not like cool you know not, not retro no it was just
[4224.42 → 4229.94] it was just old yeah whatever it's called something modern, and so we almost bought like a
[4229.94 → 4236.74] row home yeah that was what was that was what was like kind of comfortable, and then we pushed ourselves
[4236.74 → 4242.74] hard, and you've got to remember that I am married to someone who I don't think really clued in to how
[4242.74 → 4249.14] exceptional she is until I finally did it I think I got through to her, we were uh in the Costco
[4249.14 → 4257.70] parking lot we were kind of like walking into the store and i um I was like yeah you know I've uh i
[4257.70 → 4266.74] I always like knew but i never really thought about how insane it is that you got hired as the manager
[4266.74 → 4273.38] of a Costco pharmacy at 23. That is insane
[4273.38 → 4281.70] just graduated major corporation straight to manager super high hiring standards
[4283.30 → 4288.66] straight to managing a department with functionally no experience I mean she had some pharmacy work
[4288.66 → 4292.34] experience from her practicum and I think she had like a year's experience working at
[4292.34 → 4298.42] or half a year's experience or something working at save on um in the pharmacy there, and she went
[4298.42 → 4305.86] straight to managing a department and and and I was like I was I I was thinking about it because
[4306.98 → 4314.42] I don't think we've ever seen and no offence to the many very talented people who work for and
[4314.42 → 4320.18] who have applied at Linus media group I don't think we have ever seen anyone who's walked in at 23 and
[4320.18 → 4333.86] we've gone holy we will hire this person to manage a team of 15 to 20 people immediately, and she was like
[4333.86 → 4339.06] oh yeah i never really thought about that before and I was like yeah okay have I finally gotten through
[4340.82 → 4347.38] so anyway the point that I was getting at here is that was with the benefit of her working as a pharmacy
[4347.38 → 4354.10] manager which is not normal for our cohort I should not have been married to someone that was making
[4354.10 → 4362.50] six figures I also dropped out and got extremely I worked hard and I like to think that I'm also not
[4362.50 → 4370.58] stupid right but I got pretty lucky not everyone who took an entry-level job at NCI advanced to senior
[4370.58 → 4375.46] management in four years or whatever five years or whatever it was I do think you're making all this
[4375.46 → 4380.98] comparison which is all fair but your house that house was more expensive a lot of other options
[4380.98 → 4385.22] that were no, no that's that's what I'm saying the location makes it way more expensive if we're looking
[4385.22 → 4392.90] at like the north Americas as a whole sure it was relatively common to have a garage available to
[4392.90 → 4398.50] start your company it was at that year so okay I was looking at it within from like a Vancouver market
[4398.50 → 4403.14] perspective you're looking at it from a North America why culturally for people who would have
[4403.14 → 4406.82] watched the video yeah that makes sense for the largest demographic of people that would have
[4406.82 → 4413.86] watched the video in Vancouver even then it was still a garage was crazy yeah, and it was because
[4413.86 → 4424.90] Yvonne and I just like teamed up and life together hard from 18 which is also not normal yes like i
[4424.90 → 4430.34] i I look back and I go if I'd had to solo it for
[4432.90 → 4439.14] some period of years rights instead of having a partner everything would have been way harder
[4439.86 → 4440.90] absolutely everything
[4443.38 → 4453.94] yeah fair enough um but yeah no and now I mean there are still places that are cheap every once in a
[4453.94 → 4461.46] while I'll, I'll just like I'll, I'll jump onto a real estate listing site, and you know you'll find
[4461.46 → 4469.38] like a detached home that's you look at, and you go yeah I couldn't even I couldn't even buy like
[4470.26 → 4476.50] an empty lot in like Chilliwack for that it's priced knowing that you're going to have to somehow
[4476.50 → 4481.14] get rid of all the material that is the current house no, no no, no no, no no well no in some parts of
[4481.14 → 4486.42] the states and stuff like you can buy a whole house like that you can live in tomorrow
[4486.42 → 4490.50] for like less than what you'd pay for an empty lot in Chilliwack because I've walked through places
[4490.50 → 4495.30] around here that like seems like they're nicely priced and then as you're walking through it
[4496.10 → 4503.14] the wood in the floor is so like rotten and mouldy that you're like concerned you're gonna fall through
[4503.14 → 4511.78] the floor and there's just like doom and treachery around every corner uh it's it can get pretty
[4511.78 → 4517.78] sketch on the cheaper end um what are we supposed to be talking about oh right are they have they
[4517.78 → 4524.58] figured things out they have it's working I have verified it's working its working so I'll go through the
[4524.58 → 4531.22] flow so if you go on the lttstore.com site you can click on this banner which says view video
[4531.22 → 4537.14] on YouTube uh the video is banner I hardly know her the video is unlisted so you're probably going to have
[4537.14 → 4543.78] to find it through the site uh but if you go to the unlisted video that you can click on the banner on
[4543.78 → 4549.86] the store to get to uh you can then see these screwdrivers which say they're a certain cost uh but
[4549.86 → 4556.98] maybe don't worry about that cost, and then you click on it then you add it to cart and then when
[4556.98 → 4563.78] you get there it's discounted there's two of them here it's discounted oh that okay there were two i
[4563.78 → 4571.86] was like oh wait what yeah yeah yeah yeah okay cool yep that was a little freak out
[4571.86 → 4579.78] that's how it works is the flow weird yes, yes does it work also yes double yeah yes
[4579.78 → 4585.38] yes um yeah it's gonna look like it's not working there is a there is a point that you get to
[4585.38 → 4591.46] in this flow that feels strange I'm going to point it out you, you click on your click on so uh let me go
[4591.46 → 4597.22] back oh my god you're on the video you scroll down you click on the thing it shows this price here you
[4597.22 → 4602.82] click on the thing you get there and I don't see anything going on you know I don't see any discounts
[4602.82 → 4607.86] or anything well there's a thing down below it says here yeah watch the video but this price which is
[4607.86 → 4611.94] what 99 of people are just going to see they're not going to read anything else looks like that right
[4611.94 → 4620.66] if you click add to cart and then go to your cart now it's correct um yeah now it's correct because i
[4620.66 → 4627.38] have I have gone into my cart to see it so you gotta have some follow through it's like a golf
[4627.38 → 4634.82] swing or something you ever compare your sales uh pipeline to a golf swing can't say I've ever
[4634.82 → 4639.86] compared anything to golf in any way oh nice
[4642.26 → 4646.74] uh what now huh so yeah they're the same screwdrivers you know and love just dressed in some very fun
[4646.74 → 4654.98] very nostalgic y2k clear tech colours uh prismatic series that discount that Luke showed you the 20
[4654.98 → 4660.50] off that we've teamed up with YouTube shop to offer is from December 26th to 30th
[4660.50 → 4667.38] don't wait also uh we've got a bunch of other cool stuff that you can check out on the store right
[4667.38 → 4676.02] now if you've ever seen our afield ct scanner video this might look a little familiar it's inspired
[4676.02 → 4682.50] by the see-through scans that we get when we put products in the machine cool right that is cool so
[4682.50 → 4688.58] we've got um what all do we have on here we have someone wearing a vision pro uh oh right behind the
[4688.58 → 4697.38] mic right there we've got a CPU there it is these are actual scans out of the afield scanner uh we've
[4697.38 → 4704.58] got a little bread sorus uh plastic toy we've got a screwdriver in there I think there's a yep there's a
[4704.58 → 4710.98] game controller so you can see like the rumble motors and stuff um, and it's just kind of a cool
[4712.18 → 4716.66] all over print hoodie that if people don't look that closely at they might not even realize that
[4716.66 → 4724.26] it's like a bunch of a bunch of tech and stuff um leg.GG slash all over print you can
[4724.26 → 4732.34] check that out there and and wait there's more oh it's finally here oh it's finally here
[4732.34 → 4734.58] here the first party bit case
[4737.22 → 4748.58] from lttstore.com there it is ladies and gentlemen uh seven eight seven eight 30 holds 30 bits
[4750.50 → 4756.82] but stop it I don't know stop it they didn't even see you do that they can't even see you right now
[4756.82 → 4766.58] he's over here he's over here dabbing again just stop it um anyway the point is it closes with a
[4766.58 → 4772.66] magnet, and it has one of those little key things so you can throw a magnetic cable management uh power
[4772.66 → 4779.70] bar holder on it, and then you can just like stick it to stuff and and wait there's more
[4779.70 → 4790.82] it's been 83 years, but we finally have paused a drive oh for our European friends
[4792.10 → 4796.26] this is one of those things where a lot of people don't even realize that there is a difference
[4797.38 → 4802.26] and they just grab a Phillips bit when the screw is actually paused a drive, and then they wonder why
[4802.26 → 4808.26] it's slipping or getting stripped turns out wrong bit we now have pause drive bits for when you actually
[4808.26 → 4813.70] need pause drive bits which is more often than you might realize uh IKEA for instance I believe
[4813.70 → 4819.62] uses pause a drive so you can shop both the LTT screwdriver bit case and the positive bits
[4820.26 → 4828.82] at leg.GG slash post bit case that is a horrible vanity URL um p-o-z-i
[4828.82 → 4840.66] bit case anyway uh oh what page not found i it was there hold on what just happened no not that
[4842.82 → 4846.98] no, no I know but it it went it went it I'm so confused see
[4849.54 → 4852.34] okay well we should probably deal with that whatever it's probably on the home page
[4852.34 → 4860.98] please tell me it's on the home page yeah there it is okay nice post underscore a bit case
[4862.02 → 4869.06] good enough we'll figure it out drop table employees asks why bit holder 30 bits such a
[4869.06 → 4876.98] missed opportunity to make it 32 bit I know right it was the exact same thing with the um
[4876.98 → 4884.82] um with this one too I wanted to make the precision bit set I wanted to make it 64 bit
[4884.82 → 4892.02] but it just ended up working out better to be 60 bites so I'm sorry I'm sorry and I will do better
[4892.02 → 4898.10] next time that'll be the sequel to both of them so lots of good stuff on the store this week
[4899.14 → 4902.74] great time to you know pick up the Christmas present that you didn't get
[4902.74 → 4907.70] the game that we actually it's now become consistent i I've noticed that there is a spike
[4907.70 → 4913.46] on Christmas day even if we don't have any promos running of just like people expected a thing and
[4913.46 → 4918.02] then they're just like still sitting on the couch and like yeah to cart check out see ya yeah uh or
[4918.02 → 4926.02] people spending Christmas money so it's one it's one of the two, but it's 100 a thing that makes sense i
[4926.02 → 4931.70] just haven't received Christmas money in a long time yep
[4932.34 → 4936.74] all right uh Dan what are we supposed to be doing all right we're supposed to explain merch messages
[4936.74 → 4945.30] so if you're new to wan show welcome hey thanks for hanging out with us on the wan show if you knew
[4945.30 → 4950.66] then the way to interact with the show is not to throw money at your screen we're really not that into
[4950.66 → 4958.10] that um frankly you know I'm doing pretty okay he's doing pretty okay I'm all right um that doesn't
[4958.10 → 4963.46] mean that we don't like making money and there are other people that work here we do and that's our
[4963.46 → 4972.02] jobs and that's their jobs and uh you know yeah that's cool but what we also like a lot is working
[4972.02 → 4979.94] hard for that money we really do we so a glutton for it, I think we so often choose the hard path
[4979.94 → 4987.46] yeah so instead of just having you throw money at us through twitch bits or um whatever the YouTube
[4987.46 → 4994.50] ones are called super chats or anything like that uh we create what we feel are really amazing products
[4994.50 → 5000.26] and we have you guys buy those products, and then you can send a message to the show like that and then
[5000.26 → 5006.58] even if we don't get to your message um you still get high quality merchandise in the mail it's its a
[5006.58 → 5012.34] great it's a pretty good system so why don't we show you guys how it works um you go ahead and you
[5012.34 → 5016.98] go on to the site you add something to your cart and when you're in your cart Luke's working on it
[5016.98 → 5022.42] he's working he's cooking let him cook let him cook you go ahead and add something to your cart and
[5022.42 → 5028.58] when we're live you will see no I meant to click the arrow to go to the next one yeah sure full pitch
[5028.58 → 5036.50] transparency mode nice Tom's such a chad um okay there you go merch message so you write a little
[5036.50 → 5047.46] message that will go to producer Dan there he is stopped it do it right no i like this stop it
[5048.66 → 5054.18] stop it no we're just going no forget it stop if it's great that will go to producer Dan
[5054.18 → 5064.74] try again there it is so triggered right now who will put your merch message on the screen like
[5064.74 → 5072.42] that one that's up there Tina v what's up uh or who will reply to it or who will curate it for me and
[5072.42 → 5078.02] Luke to respond to why don't we show you guys with a couple curated messages how that works sure I got
[5078.02 → 5085.94] one here from josh hey Minnie Louie and Glenn saying hi from Toronto hi Toronto what do you
[5085.94 → 5092.42] think is the most pressing issue tech is facing but doesn't get much media attention brain ratification
[5092.42 → 5097.86] of social media perhaps there's a decent amount of attention on that that is probably the biggest
[5097.86 → 5105.22] single problem but oh I'm going to say the biggest single problem is perverse incentives
[5105.22 → 5114.42] okay so he just he just went one step down he went to the root yeah yeah, but they asked
[5114.42 → 5120.10] what the biggest problem it's a good move but that it's arguable that that's the biggest problem with
[5120.10 → 5128.50] like everything yes so yes perverse incentives they're a huge problem I mean we talk about it
[5129.06 → 5135.14] from like a management perspective often yeah like creating KPIs for people that incentivize
[5135.22 → 5139.94] completely the wrong behaviours that are destructive to themselves their department the entire company
[5140.50 → 5147.62] um that just like can seem well-intentioned at the time like you could create an incentive for
[5147.62 → 5153.86] someone to uh you know I don't know reply to the most emails right, or you know what a great example Linus
[5153.86 → 5161.54] Torvalds called out um you know a super you know visionary tech leader for valuing lines of code oh man there
[5161.54 → 5166.42] was a lot of points in that video I watched the whole thing there are a lot of points in that video
[5166.42 → 5172.50] where is he based or what very validated about different stances that was very much one of them
[5172.50 → 5177.14] yeah well I specifically brought that up on your behalf you were like there's a particular member and I was
[5177.14 → 5186.26] like yeah it was great um and and and so and and and by creating you know theoretically right like on the very
[5186.26 → 5192.74] very very very top crust of the earth surface um crust is very thin relative to the depth of the earth
[5192.74 → 5198.26] okay that seems like it could be a good idea you tell this man has kids you want your you want your
[5198.26 → 5208.58] developers to like code a lot right yeah sure passes the initial i person should be doing work what is
[5208.58 → 5214.02] work typey I want lots of typey yeah exactly that's the amount of thinking that but if you were to
[5214.02 → 5219.62] think about it for longer than about four seconds you might think oh wait quantity is probably not
[5219.62 → 5224.90] the most beneficial thing to this person maybe career development valuable one of the keys that
[5224.90 → 5232.34] they could typey is backspace or delete yeah who knows um and so and and and so if you think
[5232.34 → 5239.30] about it, you know you're you're creating an incentive for potentially slapdash shoddy inefficient work
[5239.30 → 5249.94] um and so-and-so perverse incentives exist everywhere, and you know right now I think that in gaming for
[5249.94 → 5262.50] instance um gamers have created a reward system for developers that rewards forever live service gotcha
[5262.50 → 5274.74] embedded ads um expensive uh loot boxes uh roster packs pay to win um and it is human nature
[5275.38 → 5283.86] to get a reward and repeat that behaviour and the only difference now is that we're doing it on an
[5283.86 → 5292.26] industrial scale um you know I think that the I think that the new the business funding machine
[5292.26 → 5299.70] has created perverse incentives to target infinite exponential growth because that's where they get
[5299.70 → 5304.90] their reward from and that's where we get bizarre behaviour like buying all the memory in the world
[5304.90 → 5314.18] for an entire year um pretty much no matter I mean you know we were talking a lot about piracy earlier in the show
[5314.18 → 5325.62] um I think that by in some cases pirating online media we can create perverse incentives for ever more
[5325.62 → 5333.86] intrusive advertising and paywalls and monetization structures because people expect to be paid for
[5333.86 → 5344.02] their work which is wild crazy right um but I think if people had continued to not become
[5344.02 → 5351.54] immune to banner ads or block them we might not have ended up with say something remember that do you
[5351.54 → 5354.74] remember that audio clip because I will never forget it what
[5357.38 → 5361.70] man what is that I don't even remember what it was for ingrained in my brain but I don't remember what
[5361.70 → 5366.50] it's for or from the say something and what yeah but I know it's like a thing that I've heard it was a
[5366.50 → 5372.02] banner ad for something I don't remember what it was, but it was an audio banner ad yeah, and it was just it
[5372.02 → 5377.70] was the most obnoxious one i would i would oh my god my speakers are on sometimes yeah yeah and
[5377.70 → 5385.46] sometimes you'd have to like to find it yeah yeah I remember this yeah i just and um and yeah so i and
[5387.22 → 5391.54] and it's one of those things where like with on the subject of ad block right I never said don't do it
[5391.54 → 5399.22] I've even showed people how to do it but what I did say was consider the outcomes every action we take
[5399.22 → 5408.34] has consequences and if you want quality media that you enjoy if you want you know quality writing that
[5408.34 → 5422.66] you like to read um then you may consider that those things need financial support to exist um, or you may not
[5422.66 → 5434.34] but then just you know when we're in the dystopian AI slop future um just you know understand that we all
[5435.06 → 5445.94] me him even him we all had a part to play in in in this outcome and this is really, really important okay
[5445.94 → 5451.30] so put down your keyboards one moment please this is really, really important we might have ended up there
[5451.30 → 5458.50] anyway we might have ended up with the intrusive ads we might have ended up with AI slop all the things
[5458.50 → 5464.50] and human jobs being cut we might have ended up there anyway because corporate greed truly knows no limits
[5468.18 → 5470.34] but we might not have, and we'll never know now
[5472.98 → 5479.30] yeah so that's cool I think it's somewhat true but also if the incentives are the opposite where like if
[5479.30 → 5485.46] you if you don't support things that do that the corporate greed will follow where the incentives are
[5486.98 → 5495.94] corporate greed is a guarantee yeah but if we provided incentives um to build high quality products for
[5495.94 → 5503.54] instance then the corporate greed would follow that yeah, but we provide incentives to build disposable
[5503.54 → 5512.10] the cheapest possible the cheapest possible thing, and you know that's why oh boy that's why North American
[5512.10 → 5513.70] manufacturing was offshore
[5517.70 → 5520.58] I find it funny that you moved away from the mic as if you're trying to like dodge
[5521.78 → 5522.26] offshore
[5522.26 → 5529.22] something like yeah I mean if I can talk at them that way maybe they can yell at me through it
[5529.22 → 5532.26] you can make speakers be microphones can you make microphones be speakers
[5532.98 → 5539.54] um yes can you I think so it feels like probably I think if you did it hard enough probably I don't
[5539.54 → 5545.54] know that they'd be loud but yeah yeah yeah people are saying yes you can yeah all right so then it could happen or ruin the mic
[5545.54 → 5551.86] like I don't think they're concerned about that yeah so um, so this is one of those things that it's like
[5551.86 → 5559.06] we have no further to look than you know in the mirror and I'm a participant every single time that I go to
[5559.06 → 5564.82] the dollar store to buy a barbecue scraper rather than buy one from smarter every day there is I think I've
[5564.82 → 5570.26] I think I've pointed this video maybe a couple of times on Sancho, but there is a video by speed
[5570.26 → 5575.86] speed like I show speed no this comes up every time um
[5577.30 → 5583.30] barbecue scraper man yep I love that that's like in some circles what he's known for now
[5584.58 → 5592.66] really yeah that is pretty interesting yeah right can I find this video he did a video on like buying
[5593.22 → 5600.10] uh like you know they don't make them how they used to is that true um, and it's actually very
[5600.10 → 5606.58] interesting if I can even find it which so far I can't speaking of perverse incentives YouTube titling
[5606.58 → 5616.74] and thumbnails we wouldn't do it if I didn't even try to search for this because you know I'm not like
[5616.74 → 5622.34] oh this guy does clickbait it's just like it's a standard on the platform now right you like
[5622.34 → 5630.82] basically have to um and where is it I don't think it's that funny high kid says all incentives are
[5630.82 → 5635.86] perverse and to degrade moral integrity when you make a decision based on only benefits you're not
[5635.86 → 5640.74] exercising your moral willpower, and it will atrophy over time the starting point of any decision should
[5640.74 → 5649.06] be your own moral framework which is cool in theory it's great in theory welcome to companies and the
[5649.06 → 5656.82] second that you have 100 mouths to feed um, and you make it's not even just that the standard
[5656.82 → 5662.34] state for companies is corporate greed that's how companies work it's honestly well at a certain
[5662.34 → 5667.54] level how they sort of have to sort of I mean you don't even have to start there which is why I started
[5667.54 → 5673.30] with the second you have 100 mouths to feed and pivoting your company in some way will be the difference
[5673.30 → 5679.86] between a Christmas bonus and mass layoffs then I will ask I'll turn the question around on you and
[5679.86 → 5688.02] I'll ask which was the moral choice because the railroad tracks were your own personal integrity
[5688.02 → 5694.34] or all of your employees lined up tied down on the railroad track
[5697.14 → 5702.50] which switch do you pull it's not that simple, but then there are also some layoffs that are super
[5702.50 → 5709.86] simple um where it's like I don't know stock dollar number go up if fire large number of people
[5709.86 → 5716.66] and then I get new boat yeah I choose boat I would say that's a super perverse incentive yeah yeah
[5716.66 → 5723.30] uh maria says line is taking gambling ads next year confirmed uh no we are very far from uh we are very
[5723.30 → 5732.42] far from that point um you know i I do think that's an interesting that's an interesting line though i
[5732.42 → 5739.30] mean it's one of those things that um I found it okay Luke hold on before you click that
[5739.30 → 5749.06] yes if Colton came to us and said hey basically you know the industry is getting hit super hard
[5749.06 → 5754.66] you know there's no there's no advertising in coming in from tech companies because they can't
[5754.66 → 5761.70] sell anything anyway because you know literally like they don't they can't get enough ram to sell
[5761.70 → 5768.10] computers that have ram in them um hot take I think that's actually a perfect decision for them to
[5768.10 → 5775.14] do but anyway um you know basically our revenue is going to be down by 30 percent
[5775.14 → 5781.54] we will have to let go of you know we have some buffer we're not an irresponsibly run company
[5782.10 → 5790.42] um, and we have done it before, and you know to an extent we'll do it again where we'll, we'll
[5790.42 → 5796.74] cut profits in order to maintain head count, but we're going to lose 10 of our people we're going to lose
[5796.74 → 5804.50] 10 I have a solution we're going to work with draft kings, or you know whatever, and they'll basically pay us
[5804.50 → 5810.74] a guaranteed you know amount over the course of the year um would you rather cut 10 of your teams
[5810.74 → 5817.54] or would you rather take a gambling sponsorship and to be clear I'm not saying that you can tell
[5817.54 → 5823.54] he's agitated because chair shaking he's doing the leg thing um it's its a constant state, but it ramps up
[5823.54 → 5829.30] when I'm when I'm agitated that's for sure yeah and this is all this is all easy for people to say
[5829.30 → 5836.34] it's its all easy for people to take a stance on until it's someone they know personally right yeah
[5837.06 → 5844.02] uh you know good people because the reason why I'm saying good people is this is not one
[5846.42 → 5853.30] this is due to global market factors this scenario you're laying out is that it's not because
[5853.30 → 5860.26] of anyone's individual failure no we just have to cut heads yep and I mean look this is and this is a
[5860.26 → 5868.26] hard truth the head that we cut won't be mine I'm I'll, I can absorb some of it but like it's not going
[5868.26 → 5872.98] to be like oh let's just like not have Linus anymore and let's keep everyone else like that's not happening
[5874.18 → 5880.58] I do think there's that like uh how the Nintendo executives dealt with Wii U is just like deeply based
[5880.58 → 5887.94] deeply but it also for those who didn't know uh Nintendo like slashed executive pay when the Wii U was
[5887.94 → 5893.78] a failure like pretty hard, and they did not touch to my knowledge they did not touch uh IC individual
[5893.78 → 5894.58] contributor pay
[5897.70 → 5905.14] yeah trying to find this I forget the exact details but basically Nintendo was like hyper based when the Wii U
[5905.14 → 5909.38] this is an AI overview thing, but this sounds accurate to my memory no I'm going to go find a source
[5909.38 → 5913.78] screw it I don't care I'm trying to be fast because it's on the show but you guys are just going to have
[5913.78 → 5919.94] to wait okay while you're waiting for him, it's funny um you know 50 layoffs for the CEO and 20 to 30
[5919.94 → 5930.18] layoffs for uh pay cuts other exactly sorry yeah uh 50 layoffs for uh oh my god why can't I say this
[5930.18 → 5942.10] properly 50 pay cut for Satoru Iwata um and 20 to 30 reductions for other executives yeah super based
[5942.10 → 5946.66] based that being said you said 30 revs down
[5950.02 → 5956.58] I don't think I don't think that would solve well no it wouldn't because so even if we did that well no
[5956.58 → 5962.58] no, no that's why I said 30 revenue down we would have to take a 10 pay cut because I'm assuming that
[5962.58 → 5969.22] we will absorb some of it oh yeah okay whatever but like what I'm saying is we can't absorb all of
[5969.22 → 5974.42] it, so the choice is at 30 rev down I don't think we could even if we wanted to it's what I'm trying
[5974.42 → 5978.74] to oh yeah no we couldn't that's what I'm trying to communicate like it's not viable we could we
[5978.74 → 5985.46] could for honour's sake pull the and probably would I suspect in this case pull the uh Nintendo move
[5986.18 → 5992.34] but that would not pull us out of we're still screwed yeah so like we still have to do something
[5992.34 → 5997.54] war chest blah blah blah, but a 30 reduction in rev is not something a lot of companies can just like
[5997.54 → 6005.94] take on the chin and keep going this is like catastrophic yes yeah, yeah like i can tell
[6005.94 → 6014.98] you now Linus media group incorporated float plane inc creator warehouse inc do not have 30 net profit
[6014.98 → 6024.98] yeah which is fine which is fine but a fact nonetheless, but it is a fact and so if it came
[6024.98 → 6031.46] to that there is no well Linus should just make less outcome yeah that is going to be acceptable
[6031.46 → 6038.10] doesn't resolve the problem yeah um so I mean and look if you could just say hey look I hope i
[6038.10 → 6042.42] never have to make this choice and I'm not going to force you to answer the question no I think my
[6042.42 → 6048.34] point was just that it's hard it's not black and white that was the point but if you think you have
[6048.34 → 6056.26] an answer I'm interested it's tough but I would talk to my teams I would just be super real about the
[6056.26 → 6062.26] situation that we're in and I think what I would do is
[6065.06 → 6071.70] yeah I don't know describe the situation describe the problem that we're in and maybe even end up oh
[6071.70 → 6080.34] man i would enthusiastically talk about the fact that we really don't want to do things like
[6080.34 → 6085.94] gambling sponsorships that it goes against the standards that we've set for ourselves yada
[6085.94 → 6092.90] Ada Ada Ada but that there is no way that we have been able to find out of this scenario because
[6092.90 → 6099.38] again we're in the confines of this thought experiment yeah there is no other route because
[6099.38 → 6102.98] we're not we're not saying this is technical reality we're saying this is the confines of the
[6102.98 → 6108.98] thought experiment yeah the confines of the thought experiment is the only path out is either layoffs or
[6108.98 → 6114.90] or ad sales this is not a reality eliminated every other option this is not a reality situation
[6114.90 → 6121.54] so I would talk to the people discuss um potential solutions that we don't want to do the ad thing
[6121.54 → 6127.06] but if everyone is like hyper desperate, and they're like look there literally are no jobs I will be
[6127.06 → 6133.54] homeless if this doesn't happen then we discuss as a team what that means which in the current job
[6133.54 → 6140.50] market is like decently realistic could be realistic and um people are talking across the
[6140.50 → 6147.54] board pay reductions okay so that's one of those things that's a great idea until it happens to you
[6147.54 → 6153.94] yeah so we discovered something many years ago when we pretty much mostly let me interject
[6153.94 → 6159.54] real quick if the whole group came to that conclusion that's one thing that is one thing they won't and
[6159.54 → 6166.18] that would be with leaders taking a higher pay cut etc yeah I don't think they necessarily would we
[6166.18 → 6172.66] discovered years ago that running sweepstakes uh instead of creating one winner creates a million
[6172.66 → 6180.26] losers and it just it generates more negativity than any positivity out of it could possibly have been
[6180.26 → 6187.62] generated um and in the same way that if we were to cut 10 of the workforce we'd be creating 10 low
[6187.62 → 6194.10] morale all people who don't work here anymore and if we cut the entire workforce by 10 we'd be
[6194.10 → 6200.02] generating the entire workforce low morale yeah, and they would all still work I think there is great
[6200.02 → 6207.46] I think there is technically a way out uh with the entire workforce reduction thing if the whole team
[6207.46 → 6215.06] the entire team sure rallies behind it and is like okay we will restore this if we get to whatever
[6215.06 → 6222.90] state um then cool I think that's extremely tough it's not going to happen I mean already
[6222.90 → 6228.66] scrappy DP is taking a stance that would be incompatible with us crawling our way out of this
[6228.66 → 6231.54] out of this hole you'll get 10 less work
[6233.54 → 6239.14] yeah I don't know like I said there are specific teams that could do this yep that could rally behind
[6239.14 → 6244.90] this banner and there are certain teams that would be unable to um I don't know where we're at that's
[6244.90 → 6250.58] not even part of this conversation doesn't really matter I can imagine companies though I can imagine
[6250.58 → 6254.74] states of different companies too where they would have been in a spot where that would be totally fine
[6256.10 → 6262.82] but I can also imagine companies where people would be like well I mean I'd rather leave and then it's
[6262.82 → 6267.62] like okay cool and then you kind of pivot to a position where it's like all right if we know we have to do this
[6267.62 → 6272.74] layoff thing let's do this as like a team and instead of just like blind siding people let's try
[6272.74 → 6277.70] to work with you try to help you find positions you can work here until this time let's work with you
[6277.70 → 6283.38] full time until then to try to help you get a spot things like that um there are ways out to
[6283.38 → 6289.30] try to lessen the blow in this specific scenario where there is no other way out you're not doing
[6289.30 → 6294.98] it because of individual performance blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah um crater says
[6294.98 → 6300.50] pay cuts plus company ownership percentage could maybe balance out part of the morale blow
[6300.50 → 6304.74] yeah the issue is that it's a fun it just doesn't it just doesn't really work that way
[6305.38 → 6311.14] like it's um people ultimately are most impacted by the things that most impact them directly
[6311.14 → 6314.50] and that sounds like a kind of stupid unnecessary thing for me to have to say
[6315.38 → 6321.30] but it's its the truth at the end of the day a bunch of people being miserable all at the same
[6321.30 → 6328.02] time in theory you know misery loves company and all of that, but it doesn't actually make when we
[6328.02 → 6332.82] say misery loves company we don't say that it like makes them happier that everyone's miserable it just
[6333.86 → 6340.90] um is something to talk about you know, and it can create a death spiral oh yeah I was going to say i
[6340.90 → 6345.46] always interpreted that statement differently yeah I thought misery loves company is because people
[6345.46 → 6352.82] who are miserable will like radiate misery yeah oh yeah yeah yeah a hundred percent and um
[6354.10 → 6358.50] yeah I don't think we need to go like too much further into this we're not the mighty reptar said
[6358.50 → 6363.86] people are able to be so idealistic when they can just type in chat yeah it's tough I'm trying to like
[6363.86 → 6368.90] actually think about actually being in this scenario, and you know emotions are going to end up getting
[6368.90 → 6373.78] really, really high people are going to end up getting really, really mad yeah uh pointing fingers is gonna
[6373.78 → 6378.02] happen almost immediately and here's the thing like remember the emotional response last week when
[6378.02 → 6383.14] I was talking about the perspective adjustment on ram pricing at the end of the day most of the things
[6383.14 → 6390.10] we buy in a given year are not ram and don't have ram in them yeah um, but this was something that
[6390.10 → 6396.66] you know especially if okay let's say because it's all about like me right now how does
[6396.66 → 6402.18] this impact me for most people and that's human I'm not blaming anybody for that but if you are the
[6402.18 → 6410.10] person who has been saving up for two years to finally buy a gaming pc or a steam deck or whatever
[6410.10 → 6416.90] it is, and you've just been you've had it yanked away from you, it's like yeah grand scheme of things
[6417.78 → 6423.54] most things only have ram as part of their cost so even if ram goes up double or triple that didn't
[6423.54 → 6428.50] double or triple the overall price of the thing like you know on numbers on a spreadsheet in a
[6428.50 → 6435.70] in a live chat you know it's its not that impact for that person it's the difference between they
[6435.70 → 6442.18] can buy that thing that they've been dreaming of for two years, and now they cannot and for some people
[6442.18 → 6450.74] a 10 pay cut could be the difference between surviving and not and so it's easy to say like oh
[6450.74 → 6455.78] yeah the team should just all agree on a 10 pay cut to weather the storm and not take you know gambling
[6455.78 → 6462.10] ads or whatever but I wouldn't even it's its not like I wouldn't understand that one person who goes
[6462.10 → 6469.54] I cannot do that yeah totally reasonable but Leah k in flow plane chat said a while back my
[6469.54 → 6474.10] company offered a voluntary five percent pay cut as an alternative to redundancy layoffs, and it worked
[6474.82 → 6479.30] and then there's other people in here saying that morale at their company has been ruined because of
[6479.30 → 6486.18] a layoff that happened due to decreased revenue like there is this is a no actual good answer
[6486.18 → 6493.14] scenario there are a lot of those scenarios in life um and realistically someone is going to be
[6494.66 → 6501.94] like possibly full-on crash out level livid about any answer that you come up with yep, and you just have
[6501.94 → 6507.14] to try to work with people to do the best thing you can yeah and that it's skype DP said it will depend
[6507.14 → 6510.74] on the organization totally percent it's going to depend on the group of people it's going to depend
[6510.74 → 6514.50] on how that group of people can band together to move past this it's going to depend on if that
[6514.50 → 6519.94] group of people even wants to that might be the core problem in the first place if we're being
[6519.94 → 6526.74] completely honest uh there there are so many variables so many different things, and it's uh it's its a yeah
[6526.74 → 6533.06] it's a no win scenario it's a hopefully reduced loss scenario animated says are you saying a 10
[6533.06 → 6538.42] pay cut could bankrupt your employees I don't know possibly I don't manage their finances if you look
[6538.42 → 6543.62] up no matter how much money you're making like this is exactly what I'm going to say if you look up
[6543.62 → 6549.06] income and how much people are living paycheck to paycheck it almost doesn't matter people's expenses
[6549.06 → 6556.42] often will just track their income so at the time we bought this office uh we were I think our revenues
[6556.42 → 6566.58] were over a million dollars a year right but just because we had that much revenue if we had is we
[6566.58 → 6574.66] had a significant reduction uh in our revenue, and we were still bringing in 700 000 a year or
[6574.66 → 6580.34] whatever that's still a lot of money but yeah that that could have forced us into bankruptcy because we
[6580.34 → 6587.14] had so many bills dude dar imp um said I'd happily take a 20 cut to go down to a four-day work
[6587.14 → 6594.18] week one of the problems of this scenario is how are we going to fight our way back to competitiveness
[6594.98 → 6599.06] you got to be kidding me work at that point they might as well just lay off yeah and so like buddy
[6599.06 → 6603.94] who's like you're going to get 10 less work it's like okay great so now we're well we're then because
[6604.50 → 6610.10] we're already struggling to compete because at the end of the day it is competition right
[6610.10 → 6615.54] like i I do genuinely believe that you know my fellow tech YouTubers like I don't see them as
[6615.54 → 6620.50] like bitter rival competitors because I do think that a rising tide lifts all ships yeah but in the
[6620.50 → 6625.78] grand scheme of things the much bigger picture your ship has to be floating to go up with the time your
[6625.78 → 6633.94] eyeballs you have a limited amount of stuff they can look at every day yeah so we do compete with the
[6633.94 → 6643.38] Super Bowl we compete with that you know romantic novel that is waiting on your Kindle oh my we do we
[6643.38 → 6644.50] come quivering
[6646.90 → 6652.98] we compete with your family you know we compete with functionally every single thing that you do
[6652.98 → 6660.42] for you wanting to your know hang with us on a Friday and do wan show instead of Boxing Day shopping or
[6660.42 → 6665.70] doing whatever else it is that you might want to be doing today right yeah and so if we are is
[6665.70 → 6672.90] we are failing to meet target and failing to meet payroll people you know cutting their output by 10
[6673.54 → 6680.58] sure as it isn't going to fix it like very unlikely there we could probably find some efficiency gains you
[6680.58 → 6684.66] know uh in this case as well if this person doesn't have any ownership stake and just doesn't
[6684.66 → 6689.46] really care about the company they're at or whatever then I get it totally fair yeah get it
[6690.82 → 6694.74] we're not trying to say it's necessarily unreasonable, but it's also not going to write the ship nope won't
[6694.74 → 6702.66] do that and yeah there's a yeah these are uncomfortable conversations because there's no win right and
[6703.46 → 6707.70] much like the where's your line with piracy conversation that we had earlier everyone's
[6707.70 → 6712.50] going to have a different line of what's okay here that person's line was don't reduce my pay ever
[6712.50 → 6716.82] in any circumstance ever I will go somewhere else or reduce my output and that's fine and someone
[6716.82 → 6722.02] else is going to have a different line and if your team has a wild variety of different lines which they
[6722.02 → 6726.98] will this is going to be tough yeah I don't think it's a guarantee that they will um I think there
[6726.98 → 6732.10] are teams out there usually smaller teams but I think there are we go that are that's the one
[6732.10 → 6738.42] that are somewhat in line with how they think and approach things all right time to uh speaking of
[6738.42 → 6745.62] teams let's talk about the flow plane team we're going to do an early release of a very special LTT video
[6745.62 → 6753.30] and we're going to do it right now uh okay hold on what's the special LTT video hold on I'm trying
[6753.30 → 6763.86] to find the stupid cms button there it is excuse me um but but but but but but uh
[6763.86 → 6771.14] uh okay what's happening I don't actually see it I think it's supposed to be oh wow there's a bunch
[6771.14 → 6777.46] of uh there are a bunch of videos here that are control f for kindle oh hey there it is my son wanted
[6777.46 → 6785.86] a Kindle so I made him test them all this is it folks this is the future potentially
[6785.86 → 6795.54] it's up it's posted whoa I'm very I'm excited to watch this I'm very interested what people think
[6795.54 → 6805.30] the very first video not just hosted because he's been on camera before but actually written by Linus Jr
[6806.74 → 6812.02] um and i have to say the link in the doc was directly to the video why did you even look for it
[6812.02 → 6819.54] look you're talking to the same guy that managed to accidentally filter Gmail addresses from his
[6819.54 → 6828.34] email so dell partner laptop it's that kind of show yeah uh did you leak anything by going through
[6828.34 → 6833.70] all those posts by the way no I don't think so okay that's cool I mean they're just videos that are
[6833.70 → 6841.14] coming by but yeah so yeah what it doesn't matter oh yeah I don't know should be fine I don't know
[6841.14 → 6844.74] what's coming down the pipeline maybe there's embargo things maybe there isn't no, no there's
[6844.74 → 6857.06] nothing embargo right okay cool yeah should be fine nice um good to know but yeah dude so cool uh he
[6857.06 → 6863.62] he told me he was you know he's he's become more interested in the family business over time and he
[6863.62 → 6870.82] told me he wanted to host a video because he had a lot of fun doing the um I'll buy my son any gaming pc
[6870.82 → 6876.66] which was or any gaming handheld for his birthday one and that was I think his first time being on
[6876.66 → 6882.50] camera solo when he did like the interview portions of it, and he was interested in it, I basically went
[6882.50 → 6890.42] well look I'm not gonna just like nepotism you don't just get to like to run this company it
[6890.42 → 6894.98] doesn't work like that the audience won't accept it the team won't accept it I won't accept it is
[6894.98 → 6900.58] doesn't work like that, but you'll nepotism a shot but I will give him a shot exactly seems pretty
[6900.58 → 6907.62] reasonable to me and I basically said okay well I'll tell you what then no you can't just host a
[6907.62 → 6913.78] video because that's the easiest possible layup that I could give you we're not going to do that
[6914.42 → 6921.46] but what you can do is if you will is you'll write it if you'll go through the process and I got to give
[6921.46 → 6928.98] some credit to Mr Nicholas Plough for being kind of a mentor for randy during this period um
[6930.74 → 6936.82] you'll, you'll go through the process and your assignment will be the least glamorous thing
[6936.82 → 6942.50] that I can possibly think of you will make a video on the new Kindle
[6942.50 → 6951.46] and and and it wasn't just make that work it's a good it's a perfect sign, and it wasn't just
[6951.46 → 6956.34] it wasn't just that I was choosing like the most you know boring thing that I possibly could, it was
[6956.34 → 6962.90] also something that I know that he has personal experience with he reads a lot, and he reads physical
[6962.90 → 6970.50] books he reads on his phone using the Kindle app, and he reads on a Kindle, and so I was like okay well
[6970.50 → 6976.74] here's the new colour soft here's a current gen paper white here's both of our old uh we have
[6976.74 → 6981.46] an old paper white, and we have an old before it was paper white just like kindle the same one I did a
[6981.46 → 6988.34] video on like 10 years ago I want I will lay out i I should find the doc because I basically lay it out
[6988.34 → 6993.14] okay like you know what is good about it what is bad about it would do other people like what do I like
[6993.14 → 6998.26] what do other people not like what do I not like and i kind of laid out all the questions kind of like a
[6998.26 → 7005.38] school assignment and i kind of went if you answer all of these questions plus contribute any little
[7005.38 → 7011.46] insights that might spring into your mind as you go I think you will have enough bones for a good video
[7011.46 → 7017.06] that you know our talented writing team and I can help you get this over the line to a standard of
[7017.06 → 7027.94] quality that will be acceptable for LTT, and he did a perfect job nice like perfect I'm
[7027.94 → 7032.98] genuinely excited to watch it I'm going to spoil his the best line in the video don't do that no I'm
[7032.98 → 7038.02] going to spoil it because I think no I think because that's how that's how previews work that's how modern
[7038.02 → 7043.94] media works you just tell people the best part fair enough but i I asked him this as I was reviewing
[7043.94 → 7050.66] the script I went is this your line or was this like something proof added and um he goes no, no
[7050.66 → 7055.30] that yeah that that was me and I asked proof too I was like was this you's like no, no I don't think
[7055.30 → 7060.42] so I didn't actually change that much and I went oh okay interesting and so in the conclusion he's
[7060.42 → 7066.50] talking about how the colour soft is pretty expensive, and you know the colours aren't that vibrant
[7067.14 → 7073.54] but on the other hand um going back to this you know holding up the black and white one for
[7073.54 → 7080.34] you know comics and manga and like colour media um feels like watching a fireworks display
[7080.34 → 7083.38] on a black and white TV and I was like
[7086.98 → 7093.86] that's perfect what a reference that's a good line right yeah why would even know black and white
[7093.86 → 7100.50] think about black and white TVs and the fireworks display the firework yeah why fireworks it's a great
[7100.50 → 7108.98] line it's a great line what the heck right huh, and he doesn't seem like the type of person to
[7108.98 → 7119.06] just LLM it oh no so that's actually just his line I weird yeah cool but also strange that is such a
[7119.06 → 7126.74] succinct way it's great yeah it's like yeah you know it's not the most vibrant colour but going back
[7126.74 → 7132.98] to this is like it's a generational gap in experience right writer dunked on by you and
[7132.98 → 7136.18] now I'm going to get writer dunked on by your son that's so annoying
[7136.18 → 7147.14] yeah he's a smart kid um and uh and yeah anyway he did a really great job the hosting was pretty
[7147.14 → 7154.82] tough but what's fun about the hosting was I I realized very early on in the coaching that I was
[7154.82 → 7162.02] doing with him that right I've been meaning to do this because I'll do little host coaching clinics
[7162.02 → 7167.46] once in a while we actually uploaded one of them that I did with tap and Ryan shroud uh back when
[7167.46 → 7173.54] they were here for the intel not an internal one but those guys yeah yeah and um and people responded
[7173.54 → 7180.90] really positively to like Linus hosting tips yeah, and so we're doing uh so i um i I asked our camera
[7180.90 → 7187.94] operator I think it was Andrew I asked him to roll the whole time and then um I gave it over to Sammy
[7187.94 → 7193.22] to do a float plane exclusive of me basically coaching my son on that's cool how to host a
[7193.22 → 7197.14] video because he had no idea what he was doing Sammy said that extra will be up on Monday
[7197.94 → 7205.14] on full plane that's cool yep and um and it's funny because I don't realize how many little things
[7205.14 → 7211.22] there are until I watch someone try to do it and I'm just like okay hold on a second your emphasis words
[7211.22 → 7217.86] you're picking the wrong emphasis words here's how you choose an emphasis word, and you know there's
[7217.86 → 7222.02] you know it's obviously still his first time but from the beginning of the video to the end of the
[7222.02 → 7228.98] video there was like a market change so if you're looking to improve your on-camera presentation skills
[7228.98 → 7234.10] or even in-person presentation skills maybe check out strongly recommend it that's going to be an extra
[7234.10 → 7239.94] over on float plane um Sammy says on Monday that's cool which is pretty and cool which is
[7239.94 → 7246.02] pretty cool uh okay while we're over on float plane check out Luke week two yeah where we had three
[7246.02 → 7254.90] exclusives entering around to week uh I don't know um what does it say that yeah that's what it says in
[7254.90 → 7261.62] there okay well there's a there's a q a video there's a 36 minute q a video there's a one-hour long
[7261.62 → 7269.14] effectively podcast with Riley where we talk about AI stuff cool and then there is the gaming video
[7269.70 → 7274.82] uh titled how a new studio made the multiplayer game of the year okay cool so you guys can check
[7274.82 → 7282.50] that out lots of Luke exclusives and then what else we got um oh, or maybe you want some more insights

[7286.26 → 7291.54] manager and Jordan go over the new short circuit with a set with facts that didn't make the final
[7291.54 → 7295.78] cut and some cut footage from Mitchell's AMD upgrade all this and our entire back catalogue at
[7295.78 → 7301.62] leg.GG FP when I didn't watch them too much because it's Christmas week, but you can get extras there
[7302.18 → 7307.22] for when you do watch them heck yeah there you go heck yeah yeah views have been pretty slow this week
[7307.22 → 7313.54] yeah um the last month we've actually been like pretty good pretty like solid like we're back
[7313.54 → 7320.10] baby yeah, but it's so volatile now it's crazy it's also crazy that I saw what was happening this week
[7320.10 → 7324.66] and was like that's probably fine yeah because that is not the reaction that would have happened before
[7325.38 → 7329.62] yeah which I don't know maybe that's healthy I don't necessarily think so though
[7329.62 → 7336.26] I don't know man because you can't tell how rocky the ship is any more yeah which is like not good man YouTube

[7471.70 → 7477.70] uh-oh AMD asks that we just briefly talk about the worst gifts you've received for Christmas
[7478.50 → 7485.62] I mean as a little boy it was always clothes for me, they were the worst oh I love getting socks well i
[7485.62 → 7492.02] know so I didn't know I didn't say socks I didn't say socks okay just like sock enjoyer too I don't know just
[7492.02 → 7497.14] like random sweatpants and shirts especially when it was nice clothes because I never wore nice clothes
[7497.14 → 7503.54] like people would try to give me like Sunday best they try to change your preferences based on gifts
[7503.54 → 7511.70] that's not a fun one and then I'm just like nope um I feel like mine have always been pretty good
[7512.50 → 7517.06] I forget what it is my family's like pretty sick when it comes to presents I suspect the worst thing
[7517.06 → 7523.14] I've ever received has been like a book I already had like I am sorry I'm not a good target for this
[7523.14 → 7531.38] yeah i um I'd say like i i I probably notice it more like for my kids uh like we had a family
[7531.38 → 7533.54] function this year when um
[7533.54 → 7544.26] um a lot of care and attention went into uh certain individuals that were of the same relationship
[7545.22 → 7553.70] uh sort of tree to people that were not made for my kids and I don't think my kids noticed but I did
[7554.34 → 7560.98] that's cool that your kids didn't notice that's not very cool yep yeah um but i I'd say I'd say but
[7560.98 → 7567.70] yeah I'd say that was more um yeah it's not really yeah it's not really like me at that point
[7567.70 → 7571.38] no i i think the gifts that try to change you are probably the big one
[7572.02 → 7576.82] sorry I got a wrench in a tackle box one year I was nine
[7579.30 → 7584.02] which you know for some nine-year-olds might have been sick uh
[7586.42 → 7590.66] might not have been in this case I guess i remember creating a Christmas list that
[7590.66 → 7597.94] was basically five video games that I wanted and then explicitly not receiving any video games
[7597.94 → 7604.98] from my uh from my uh from my parents who didn't like me playing video games and I was like right
[7604.98 → 7613.30] but like it is would have been less irritating if they weren't so proud of the great choice they
[7613.30 → 7618.42] made and wanted me to be really excited about it when I got you a new petticoat like yeah i really
[7618.42 → 7624.66] just want to Call of Duty what I really wanted was warcraft 2. oh yeah I've definitely been i I think
[7624.66 → 7629.22] this is a fairly standard in my household so I don't think I'm going off the wall here but normally
[7629.78 → 7638.58] Christmas lists are a highly respected like fallback almost yeah unless you say otherwise if you're like
[7638.58 → 7643.06] I really want this thing then you'll probably just like get it but Christmas list is usually like oh
[7643.06 → 7648.82] you didn't naturally without really much effort find anything therefore you can come to this list
[7648.82 → 7654.02] yeah so if you go off the list it's like totally chill and off the list is fine as long as it isn't
[7654.02 → 7660.42] passive-aggressively trying to change you totally it's a big part of that point yeah yeah yeah for sure
[7660.42 → 7665.54] yeah um which I don't think I've ever received one of those which is my whole thing where like I'm not
[7665.54 → 7672.58] i just I think I'm a bad target for this yeah Mitchell our customer service rep for Ltd store got a
[7672.58 → 7678.98] sweet Christmas gift this year thanks to AMD he got a sick Katsuki

[7812.82 → 7819.94] always happen I'm effectively almost out of time how does it happen Luke to be fair I have seen zero
[7819.94 → 7828.50] complaints sometimes it just does be how the show work is anyone watching it though does anyone like the
[7828.50 → 7836.50] wan show huh we should just not have topics then yeah no one cares I think why don't we just not have
[7836.50 → 7844.02] topics I think I can tell you guys to shut up and move on more if you want no, no that's the opposite
[7844.02 → 7853.38] yeah yeah Dan yeah way to go Dan okay don't even suggest it I'm going to start we didn't you did I was
[7853.38 → 7859.14] you know what I got you I got you I got you I tracked how about you shut up and move on
[7859.14 → 7867.62] I can't have merch messages there are so many merch messages okay what do we would do we want to do
[7869.06 → 7877.54] topics I guess uh well no here okay how about this how about this Dan do you have any curated merch
[7877.54 → 7885.14] messages that are specifically for Luke I have one okay I remember let's do that real quick styles okay
[7885.14 → 7892.90] okay, okay I need to quickly while you do that I'm going to talk about the North Korean infiltrator
[7892.90 → 7899.78] who was caught working in Amazon's it department thanks to keystroke delay oh yeah Amazon says they
[7899.78 → 7907.22] caught a fake us-based it hires after noticing unusual keystroke lag on the employee's work laptop
[7907.22 → 7913.06] which suggested the person wasn't actually working from the United States after investigating the company
[7913.06 → 7918.26] concluded the worker was based in North Korea and attempting to funnel money back to the regime
[7918.26 → 7923.38] through remote work according to Amazon's security chief the delay tipped them off that the laptop
[7923.38 → 7927.94] was being remotely controlled from overseas the company shut down the account after a few days
[7927.94 → 7933.06] and says it has blocked thousands of similar attempts in recent years often involving North Korean
[7933.06 → 7940.10] workers applying through us-based contractors as proxies yeah the discussion question is as remote
[7940.10 → 7944.74] work becomes more common how should companies balance trust privacy and security when monitoring
[7944.74 → 7950.34] employees what a great discussion question uh Dan go ahead and hit Luke with that merch message sure
[7950.90 → 7959.54] hi pirates.dll love the show my co-founder is about to become a dad Luke how did you handle Linus
[7959.54 → 7965.62] becoming a father what was the toughest part and Linus uh what about people pirating your content
[7965.62 → 7973.38] yeah I don't know uh I don't I don't actually know necessarily what the first part of that question
[7973.38 → 7978.50] means like it's not what I think they assumed that you were working together more closely and then
[7978.50 → 7984.02] Linus became a dad, and you know yeah I guess we didn't know each other that well like he hadn't moved
[7984.02 → 7990.98] in yet but uh me having a kid definitely impacted Luke more than most colleagues would I mean yeah
[7990.98 → 7999.94] yeah randy crying at night literally kept Luke awake so loud he was a difficult
[7999.94 → 8008.02] maybe he's making it up to us now because he's a great teen loudspeaker the food powered loud
[8008.02 → 8013.86] speaker yeah um I don't know dude uh there's a certain amount of things where it's just like
[8013.86 → 8020.82] like was I going to stop working with him over that no therefore is there really much left to think
[8020.82 → 8027.14] about I don't know and I'm not trying to be you know offensive to the person asking the
[8027.14 → 8032.98] question i just uh someone said why would Luke be affected I mean I technically was but like
[8034.58 → 8043.70] uh was it a bad way like this is something that Linus wanted he still worked hard and a lot
[8043.86 → 8052.58] I don't know there 's's people in around you will make decisions and do things in their lives
[8053.38 → 8059.06] that indirectly affect you to a certain degree, and you just have to not care for the most part like
[8059.06 → 8066.42] it's or like to find the good or decide if this thing that they have done is too far for you and then just
[8066.42 → 8072.42] detach Luke with the controversial live and let live take over yeah to be honest i I can't believe how
[8072.42 → 8078.58] controversial that has become but I guess live and let live is totally a thing and the world could
[8078.58 → 8082.98] use a little bit more of it and like yeah his room shared a wall with mine, and he cried a lot and was
[8082.98 → 8089.94] really loud I also got really cheap rent and great food for free there was technically wasn't there yeah
[8089.94 → 8096.34] there was technically rent it like didn't cover the food let alone right it didn't make
[8096.34 → 8102.26] any sense if I remember correctly it's 200 bucks a month and I got free food every meal insane and it
[8102.26 → 8107.46] was cooked by someone else I didn't even have to cook it his salary also wasn't much at that time because
[8107.46 → 8113.78] we just like did not have any money at that time yeah so you know but like i but I also strapped in
[8113.78 → 8120.66] knowing that no idea how much of that was legal right oh not all of it definitely not all of it I think
[8120.66 → 8125.86] we were paying monthly at that time too I think instead of bi-weekly I don't know yeah I mean
[8125.86 → 8134.10] again another thing where it's just like I can make a big deal over this or I cannot which is an
[8134.10 → 8141.54] option uh yeah I don't know it is possible so yeah it affected me I got slightly worse sleep uh but I mean
[8141.54 → 8146.50] that's a constant throughout my entire life, but he still got his decent computer on a regular cadence I did
[8146.50 → 8155.06] so I did computer was good so that deal is still you know it's still alive yeah um hey speaking of
[8155.70 → 8161.46] deals still being alive, and the deal may be changing this is probably the last major topic that Luke needs
[8161.46 → 8166.82] to be here for but um oh right how does Linus react to people pirating I think I remember the first time
[8166.82 → 8172.42] there was a torrent of scrapyard wars being pretty amused also there was some really annoying stuff at
[8172.42 → 8176.10] the beginning of flow plane yes there was some very, very trying to start a
[8176.82 → 8182.66] new incredibly small startup company thing and there were multiple attempts to just rip the
[8182.66 → 8188.74] whole thing off yeah over and over and over again it's very frustrating so yeah i I think it was a
[8188.74 → 8194.10] combination of feeling like we've made it because we're important enough for people to pirate um but
[8194.10 → 8199.46] also being like yeah you know we're not like a giant media conglomerate really hard to like pay developers
[8199.46 → 8206.02] and stuff like really sick if you guys just didn't do this yeah, yeah so both yeah uh okay, so this is it
[8206.90 → 8216.66] this is the last wan show in its current form oh really I have to leave now I thought you had to go in
[8216.66 → 8221.86] like 20 minutes no like five oh awkward really
[8224.34 → 8229.70] sorry I thought I said the week after next week I meant next week from now oh we'll talk about it next
[8229.70 → 8236.10] week talk about it next year you just baited that no, no we'll talk about it next week uh browser
[8236.10 → 8242.42] extensions oh my god fine boom oh my god browser extensions everything's going to be fine
[8242.42 → 8250.74] everything's going to be fine we will miss you guys no damn stop everything's going to be fine
[8250.74 → 8256.18] everything's going to be fine it's been a good run browser extensions are selling your conversations with
[8256.18 → 8266.50] AI chatbots for advertising purposes several popular browser extensions with more than
[8266.50 → 8272.18] eight million total users have been caught collecting and selling full AI chat conversations
[8272.18 → 8279.78] according to security researchers at KOI the biggest offenders include urban VPN proxy one click VPN proxy
[8279.78 → 8286.02] urban browser guard and urban ad blocker available on both the Chrome web store and Microsoft Edge add-ons
[8286.02 → 8292.58] together these extensions intercept conversations with chatbots even when VPN or ad blocking features
[8292.58 → 8300.34] are disabled despite advertising privacy and AI protections the extensions inject scripts that copy
[8300.34 → 8304.50] entire conversations and send them to servers that are tied to the developers where the data is used for
[8304.50 → 8309.94] marketing analytics the only way to stop the collection is to disable or uninstall the extensions entirely
[8309.94 → 8315.22] several of them were even marked as featured by google and Microsoft raising questions about extension store
[8315.22 → 8318.74] oversight wow that's pretty rough
[8321.78 → 8328.50] did you do it on purpose no I thought we had like 20 minutes I asked you for a hard out, and you said soon
[8329.86 → 8339.22] yeah yeah that that means like eight to 12 months working here I'm currently messaging to make sure but
[8339.22 → 8345.78] like the original hard out was 11 45 which is in three minutes now google sorry google has closed
[8345.78 → 8354.98] compatibility for the Sega Dreamcast's 25-year old web browser killing it four people cried out in terror
[8354.98 → 8360.50] and then were silenced what I can't figure out is how they killed it what did they do what changed I've
[8360.50 → 8365.14] looked up like a couple different articles on this I haven't done enough research but like
[8367.06 → 8372.66] what did google do to cause this to happen big g's services no longer respond, but that doesn't mean
[8372.66 → 8381.06] that they killed the web browser I mean probably kills it a little yeah probably killed a
[8381.06 → 8385.54] little uh there are still apparently fan-supported search engines and game servers that do work on the
[8385.54 → 8389.86] dream cast which is pretty crazy our discussion question here is do you think it's important for
[8389.86 → 8395.06] modern web companies to maintain compatibility with like quarter-century old devices what is an
[8395.06 → 8400.58] appropriate length of support I mean we've talked about this right like I don't think that either Luke or
[8400.58 → 8408.10] I is in the camp that whether it's a game developer or whether it's a service um provider that you're obligated
[8408.10 → 8415.94] to support stuff forever that doesn't have an ongoing forever payment um we just the part that we disagree
[8416.58 → 8422.50] about with the current way that the industry does things is that we think there should be a path to
[8422.50 → 8427.14] users maintaining it themselves if it's so important to them and this mostly applies I think to
[8428.10 → 8433.54] like game servers for instance if there's a way for it to go self-hosted or to hand over the code to the community to
[8433.54 → 8438.02] continue to run it then we're totally fine with them saying hey yeah this is not financially viable
[8438.02 → 8449.46] anymore because businesses gotta survive um what oh nothing you just you looked like you're
[8449.46 → 8454.90] making a face so yeah downer but also i I totally get it I don't think that I would fire up a dream cast
[8454.90 → 8458.18] tomorrow with the expectation that the web features would work
[8458.18 → 8465.70] I think we what hello is the expected time still the same
[8468.50 → 8471.22] okay, okay bye
[8472.74 → 8477.62] is chat asking you to try to push it or what no I was trying to figure it out because sometimes
[8477.62 → 8482.90] schedule things move and whatnot yes but uh, and they weren't responding to messages I sent them quite
[8482.90 → 8487.46] a few ah yes probably driving or something brilliant probably very reasonable yeah it makes sense but
[8487.46 → 8493.46] but not responding anyway um I called and now I know that I do have to leave cool good
[8497.62 → 8502.98] you know that's probably where I got noon from it's probably your arrival time not your departure time
[8503.86 → 8509.14] that's probably true so whoops I might have even just said noon at one point because that might
[8509.14 → 8514.18] have been what it was at one point fun fact um there was also an arrival versus departure times
[8517.70 → 8518.98] and I missed my flight
[8523.22 → 8532.18] so that was cool yeah uh i I went down to cab for Christmas I decided I shouldn't say i Yvonne and i
[8532.18 → 8541.78] decided to do something absolutely crazy this year, and we treated um my siblings and so's and kids
[8542.42 → 8551.70] and her sibling and so and kids to uh four days in Mexico for Christmas so it was a pretty sick
[8551.70 → 8559.78] pretty incredible experience a lot of fun um as siblings we've we've all been like busy
[8559.78 → 8567.94] you know, and it's its easy to take family for granted but I think that um losing my sister uh really
[8568.90 → 8579.38] sharpened my focus on yeah uh the speed with which things that you assume that you've had your
[8579.38 → 8586.34] whole life, and you assume will always be there can be stripped out of your life and so we um
[8586.34 → 8594.02] um yeah so we kind of surprised everyone, and we went hey guess what we're um we're we're doing it
[8594.02 → 8598.90] let's let's do it we're doing something crazy, and it was a lot of fun we did it all-inclusive just
[8598.90 → 8605.62] because when you've got like dude it's so much over a dozen people oh my god coordinating every
[8605.62 → 8611.22] stupid meal especially with young kids there are a lot of young kids so like oh no but if they can just
[8611.22 → 8616.34] run over and grab some food when they want it or whatever like cool makes life a lot easier uh we
[8616.34 → 8622.34] did go off resort once you have to go yeah okay, okay speaking of family uh do you want to just call
[8622.34 → 8626.74] me to do the thing do what thing at the end oh yeah yeah yeah sure okay sounds good all right cool see
[8626.74 → 8635.46] you are later okay see ya anyway yeah we went down we did one cool excursion that was oh no just leave
[8635.46 → 8641.22] the thing no I don't I don't like it just framed on me, i actually i I sent a note to one of the editors
[8641.22 → 8648.26] one of our one of our videos recently just had like too much zooming in on me, I'm pushing 40 dude
[8648.26 → 8654.34] i we don't need to be zoomed that close in on me anymore this is a good this is a good framing
[8654.34 → 8657.62] i I need to take more Polaroid pictures you know hold on
[8657.62 → 8663.54] I can fix it okay Dan's doing something here shoot I don't have the pictures on uh
[8664.74 → 8669.70] thank you for that Dan that's that's incredibly helpful I don't have the pictures on this phone
[8669.70 → 8674.18] I took along a separate um a separate phone for pictures and videos and stuff because we're
[8674.18 → 8681.94] actually going to be uploading a like a family vlog from it um, and we did this like turtle release
[8681.94 → 8687.38] thing here why don't you just be my co-host now we'll just drag you over there oh yeah you're good
[8687.38 → 8692.74] but you can just you can just move the window over there uh so yeah we did this um there's a there's
[8692.74 → 8699.78] a turtle conservation group that allows you to go and without disturbing anything like you're not
[8699.78 → 8705.06] allowed to touch the baby turtles, and you're not allowed to interfere with them imprinting on the
[8705.06 → 8710.98] beach where they were born because they have to come back in order to okay that's an option too
[8710.98 → 8720.42] sure um anyway so it's like a conservation thing, but you can do like uh you can do like a turtle
[8721.14 → 8727.94] release into the ocean thing so you hold a like born that day turtle in a bowl so you don't touch it
[8727.94 → 8733.46] so you don't hurt it, and you don't get any bacteria on your hands, and then you like to tip the bowl and they
[8733.46 → 8739.06] and you watch them like crawl into the waves, and they were saying that um thanks to the work
[8739.06 → 8744.18] that they're doing the survival rate goes from they estimate about one in a thousand reach adulthood
[8744.18 → 8749.38] in the wild to they say about six to seven in a thousand because they'll go out of their way
[8749.94 → 8756.58] to um to release them at times when there are not a lot of seagulls, and they'll uh they kind of oversee
[8756.58 → 8762.98] it so they're less likely to get picked off on the way uh to the beach from the nest which is
[8762.98 → 8770.98] pretty cool did I just do it again for crying out loud um yeah that literally came up during the
[8770.98 → 8776.74] presentation before we did the release thing now that I think about it uh was some little kid who
[8776.74 → 8785.38] you are now on par with in terms of your joke quality um was like six seven everyone kinds of went
[8785.38 → 8792.34] uh because it's over now it's six seven party is officially completely over has been for six
[8792.34 → 8803.62] seven weeks at this point um LG is responding swiftly to user backlash will allow users to remove
[8803.62 → 8809.06] the Microsoft copilot link from their TVs there's a whole topic that was written on this but I think
[8809.06 → 8815.22] that that's probably um all we need to say basically it's not a built-in TV app it is just
[8815.22 → 8821.94] a shortcut to Microsoft's copilot web app that opens in the TV's browser and um sorry about that
[8821.94 → 8828.34] also the microphone input was only able to activate with explicit user consent uh we're not sure when
[8828.34 → 8833.30] you'll be able to delete it, but it will be able to be deleted so that's good thank you LG for
[8833.86 → 8841.22] responding to the outrage in a way that is acceptable very nice uh no, no yes I know you can only
[8841.22 → 8848.18] hide it shaft 2k, but they're changing that that's why we're bringing it up uh okay yeah this is
[8848.18 → 8857.14] something you know what let's push the reboot rewind update to next week we can do that sure okay next
[8857.14 → 8864.26] week yeah sorry I'm getting a lot of merch messages today uh yeah I know Dan screwdrivers are very
[8865.06 → 8870.50] very popular for some reason well people really like they've been so excited for them people like
[8870.50 → 8877.30] screwing it's its how the whole human race survived all these millennia that's true some yeah they're
[8877.30 → 8883.54] kind of you know I've certainly read about that yep read the articles about it right and the economist
[8884.58 → 8890.74] um why don't we just do merch messages you know what no let's go through this last one okay china's
[8890.74 → 8898.42] 10 cent gains access to the banned NVIDIA Blackwell b200 chips by leveraging a rental loophole in U.S.
[8898.42 → 8904.42] export controls 10 cent is apparently accessing an NVIDIA's most advanced AI chips by renting computing
[8904.42 → 8910.02] power overseas rather than buying the hardware directly according to a Financial Times report
[8910.02 → 8914.66] the chips are housed in data centres in Japan and Australia and owned by a Japanese company called
[8914.66 → 8920.58] data section which rents the GPUs to customers through long-term contracts this arrangement allows 10 cent to
[8920.58 → 8926.18] legally sidestep U.S. export restrictions that block NVIDIA's top chips from being sold into china
[8926.82 → 8932.66] data section has signed more than 1.2 million dollars in contracts tied largely to Tencent and
[8932.66 → 8939.06] now controls around 15 000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs rapidly turning the company into one of Asia's
[8939.06 → 8945.78] the largest so-called neo cloud providers data section says demand is so high that even regulatory changes
[8945.78 → 8952.90] wouldn't hurt much as its CEO put it access to high-end GPU capacity is a very sexy asset
[8954.58 → 8958.90] oh man yeah our discussion question is should companies be allowed to legally work around export
[8958.90 → 8963.38] controls by renting computing power overseas or do you feel this undermines the purpose of those
[8963.38 → 8970.02] restrictions I mean obviously it undermines the purpose of the restrictions, but it just is the latest
[8970.02 → 8982.90] of many many many examples of times when legislation just doesn't move as fast as technological innovation
[8982.90 → 8991.78] and in some cases I end up being really glad that it doesn't but in other cases it's obvious that it is
[8991.78 → 9000.74] interfering with the abilities of governments to manage their resources and uh yeah I don't I don't know
[9001.46 → 9005.78] sort of if I'm rooting for them to be able to do that better so a lot of the time I really do think that it
[9005.78 → 9013.46] has been a benefit to the consumers but in other cases where the innovation is not a benefit to consumers like
[9013.46 → 9022.10] or I shouldn't say AI is not a benefit to consumers but where it is largely impacting consumers in a negative
[9022.10 → 9028.66] fashion with all the data harvesting and the know encouragement to you know of themselves of
[9028.66 → 9033.86] users and the romantic entanglements and all the things that have not been properly studied
[9033.86 → 9039.94] about this AI rollout I do feel like legislation would move a little bit faster is there a reason that
[9039.94 → 9046.34] Luke's photo is in black and white and everyone is saying rip Luke in the chat float plane is asking
[9046.34 → 9054.02] for it, i I don't know you do know that they are not your boss yeah, but they do funny things sometimes
[9054.02 → 9060.82] I mean they do definitely do funny things uh okay f2p4 respects float plane chat uh he's not dead he's at
[9060.82 → 9061.38] Christmas day
[9064.66 → 9065.38] okay
[9067.86 → 9068.10] um
[9069.94 → 9078.50] cool good chat I mean it's true we love Luke we do we do love Luke um
[9081.70 → 9085.38] stop you're going to make me think the stream's gone down why don't we do some merge messages
[9085.94 → 9094.18] sure we're going to when after dark let's do that although it just feels like when dark now uh let's see
[9094.18 → 9103.86] uh there's the button holy crap there's still a ton of incoming merch messages yes um it's been quite
[9103.86 → 9110.82] heavy today all right let's see what we've got here did we do this one yes we did hey DLL I asked
[9110.82 → 9118.82] this last year so I'll ask again now what 2026 releases are you most looking forward to oh man if you'd
[9118.82 → 9129.38] ask me this like a month and a half ago right like I might have said oh yeah month and a half ago I'd
[9129.38 → 9136.50] have probably said steam frame because I'm just like I'm a VR nerd I'm really looking forward to
[9137.46 → 9144.58] um not having a tether I think it's gonna legitimately make me use it more like if I could just bring a
[9144.58 → 9152.18] dongle with me and play lighter VR games on like my strip halo laptop man how cool is that like I can
[9152.18 → 9160.02] like no, no lighthouses to set up I don't know man it's flipping cool but I'm I'm deeply worried
[9160.82 → 9167.38] about what pricing is going to be like for the steam machine for the steam frame for basically
[9167.38 → 9174.02] anything that is going to be coming out in 2026 unless the bubble crashes
[9176.58 → 9183.22] um like i I okay I think that video that we did uh where David and i sort of
[9184.82 → 9189.22] reverse engineered what the pricing will be of the steam machine I think it's out i I think
[9190.26 → 9196.58] I think there's no way we got it right because we kind of assumed that the market had already priced in
[9197.14 → 9202.02] the lack of availability that was upcoming, but it looks like that is not the case and things are
[9202.02 → 9210.50] going to continue to get worse server we also haven't accounted for the potential price increases
[9210.50 → 9214.74] on GPUs like I didn't think it was going to be so bad that we weren't going to be able to get enough
[9214.74 → 9224.98] DDR um oh speaking of which we haven't done our weekly b580 check guys seriously GPUs are going to go up
[9224.98 → 9232.66] if you can still get the hot oh my god you can still get it if you need a GPU like a decent GPU right
[9232.66 → 9240.42] now go for it um I forget what our new egg affiliate link is Dan can you throw it in the chat oh
[9240.42 → 9247.62] I people also don't know any float plane's already posting it oh they're so good it's leg.GG slash new egg
[9248.58 → 9258.42] guys if you need a GPU you will thank me that you picked up a b580 before pricing went stupid
[9258.42 → 9265.38] because even though intel is rumoured to be announcing the b770 like at CES or sometime very soon
[9265.94 → 9273.14] um what I suspect is that they will build in the ram shortage pricing to that new one, and they may
[9273.14 → 9279.38] even make adjustments to the b570 and the b580 I don't know any of this for sure which is why I'm
[9279.38 → 9286.74] able to speculate on it without you know breaching any kind of non-disclosure agreement um but i strongly
[9286.74 → 9296.02] suspect that if you don't pick up this onyx lump arc b580 with 12 gigs of gddr6 for 239.99
[9296.90 → 9308.42] now with the intel holiday bundle which is I remind you battlefield 6. pick one of battlefield 6
[9308.42 → 9314.58] assassin's creed shadows dying like the beast or Sid Meier civilization 7. you get this card
[9315.30 → 9321.86] with this amount of ram for 240 us dollars, and you get a full price triple a game
[9321.86 → 9326.34] you will not be finding a better deal
[9328.74 → 9336.58] I'm going to say it next year i I really don't think so it's possible it's possible but i really
[9336.58 → 9342.74] sincerely doubt it so now is a perfect time to pick up one of these and uh and get a decent
[9342.74 → 9350.26] GPU for a decent price I mean what even is 12 gigs of ram worth right now okay so let's go with
[9350.26 → 9358.34] like a somewhat equivalent you know what's 16 gigs of ddr5 so around 200 right now for 16 gigs of ram
[9359.22 → 9366.50] so you're getting 12 gigs of ram which lets call 150 right you're getting battlefield
[9367.94 → 9377.30] for which is let's call 50 bucks so 200 you're basically paying 40 for an arc b580 GPU okay
[9377.30 → 9386.98] crazy crazy crazy there's no way that intel can be making money on that die and those arms and that
[9386.98 → 9395.46] cooler at that point like i just do it someone says that was two by 16 yes and I did a really amazing
[9395.46 → 9401.94] thing where I took the price and I cut it in half to represent 16 gigs of ram to be 200 is
[9401.94 → 9413.14] it was cool you did math on purpose I know right hi bonus book and ban I'm working on ownership of
[9413.14 → 9421.38] an Amazon DSP and need advice on balancing employee care with managing razor-thin margins in the early
[9421.38 → 9430.02] stages of the company hello from Vegas oh it's hard manned I don't think we've I don't think we've ever
[9430.02 → 9436.34] found the right balance and I think even if we found the right balance there would be people who
[9436.34 → 9442.74] don't agree we're finally doing it we're finally working on how does leg spend money uh which people
[9442.74 → 9449.46] have asked for every single time we've done how does leg make money and what I can tell you is that
[9450.02 → 9457.78] when we get down into the details of you know yeah like how much of it goes to taxes
[9457.78 → 9466.42] how much of it goes to you know a net profit for free investment for next year for shareholder
[9466.42 → 9474.34] dividends um when we get into when we get into these details I guarantee you that even though we
[9474.34 → 9481.86] are well under what many of the companies you don't hate take for profit uh there will be people who are
[9481.86 → 9485.86] mad about it there's going to be people that you know say well you should have done more there's people
[9485.86 → 9491.54] that would look at your question of you know how do I balance employee care with managing razor-thin
[9491.54 → 9498.50] margins and say well you know you're you're the owner you should, it should be 100 employee care
[9498.50 → 9502.42] and then there's going to be other people that you ask on the more business monster side that are going
[9502.42 → 9509.94] to say you know uh none of that matters outsource to cheaper labour and get your margins up
[9509.94 → 9515.30] right away or i I don't know right like it's its just like the conversation we had earlier where
[9516.50 → 9521.94] people are not going to agree on this everyone's going to have a completely different line
[9527.94 → 9532.10] oh wait sorry there was one thing I was going to say I was going to say that an important part of it
[9532.10 → 9537.54] though is communication with your team laying out very clearly you know what the reward
[9537.54 → 9543.38] is uh and what it can be and then following through on that if you're asking people to make
[9543.38 → 9551.06] any kind of personal sacrifice okay sorry go ahead sure thing for Linus do you feel like you will ever
[9551.06 → 9557.14] find a phone that you will be happy with it seems like with each phone you find nitpicks or issues
[9557.14 → 9564.34] do you think having too many so many opportunities to upgrade effects I assume this um no if anything I mean
[9564.34 → 9571.30] i i i I think I probably upgrade my phone less than almost any other electronics YouTuber who covers
[9571.30 → 9577.86] phones i I try not to I really don't like it I mean i I used the note 9 for like four years or something
[9577.86 → 9586.42] like that or three years um will I find one that I'm happy with I mean as long as designs continue to
[9586.42 → 9594.10] in no I don't think so because a lot of the direction of the mobile phone industry just
[9594.10 → 9601.38] runs counter to what I like and want out of my devices I'm pretty happy with this one but like
[9601.38 → 9607.30] I'm not gonna lie and say that it didn't immediately stop folding completely flat like literally the
[9607.30 → 9617.54] second day I had it um unless i you know give it the old you know over fold why is that like why is
[9617.54 → 9627.14] that acceptable why is that normal um the like I'm trying to think what else like yeah some of
[9627.14 → 9632.02] some of the stuff that I encountered on the iPhone was just like it's just baffling to me that it's
[9632.02 → 9640.74] that it's not that it's not you know fixed um oh man there's a video coming soon i I actually was
[9640.74 → 9648.90] dairying an iPhone air and then an iPhone 17 and then I dabbled with the iPhone um 17 pro max over
[9648.90 → 9654.10] the last almost two months I think this is the longest I've been iPhone in a while and there
[9654.10 → 9658.82] were some things that were really good and then there were also things that were just like
[9658.82 → 9673.86] infuriating um uh so yeah nitpicks and issues no I think if anything it comes down to that it's my
[9673.86 → 9681.70] job to find things that are perfect and find things that are not as good and I also tend to be
[9681.70 → 9688.66] a pretty busy person so I think I have a higher sensitivity to unnecessary interactions and
[9689.78 → 9695.94] unintuitive design than most people would because it's my job to in to get intimately familiar with
[9695.94 → 9703.78] a device really quickly and especially when it doesn't follow that same company's
[9704.66 → 9712.18] established rules for interaction it just kind of drives me nuts because I do understand that a lot of
[9712.18 → 9717.62] products these days are just sort of designed by committee and there's these huge teams
[9717.62 → 9722.66] that oftentimes will like barely even talk to each other, but you know that doesn't mean that it will
[9722.66 → 9728.98] stop driving me crazy that you know you could have a flagship android phone that for years didn't
[9728.98 → 9734.82] support a feature on YouTube which is owned by google which you know android is also you know managed by
[9734.82 → 9741.54] google um in this case it was YouTube stories that just simply wasn't supported on if it's like guys this is
[9741.54 → 9749.06] a software switch that you can just flip enable stories on tablets or stop classifying this phone
[9749.06 → 9754.50] as a tablet do one of those two things and let this let the feature run free why are you maintaining
[9754.50 → 9757.70] why are you even maintaining two different versions of the app um
[9762.10 → 9769.62] oh I do not have the pebble on right now um I'm actually finally yes finally doing it
[9770.58 → 9775.54] um it's either going to be short circuit or it's going to be LTT but I'm trying a Garmin smartwatch
[9776.66 → 9783.06] uh so pebble I shot the short circuit last week and then bell's been chasing me to do this Garmin one for
[9783.06 → 9790.42] quite a while hey Dan and the other two my question is how to reignite the passion for games it's hard
[9790.42 → 9797.14] to find the childlike wonder again I wonder if you have any tips to break the monotony hi from cam loops
[9798.74 → 9803.94] like so many things it's all about people it's all about relationships humans are we're super
[9803.94 → 9811.86] complicated, but we're also kind of simple right like we love novelty so if your hope was that you're going to
[9811.86 → 9819.14] recreate that um that experience that you'd never had before again it's not going to work like that
[9819.14 → 9824.66] so if what you loved about games was novelty um that's going to be tougher to recreate but
[9824.66 → 9830.82] there are other levers you can pull there's nostalgia I had an absolute blast I put dozens and dozens of
[9830.82 → 9835.62] hours into this roguelike hockey game called tape to tape I haven't been playing it as much lately i
[9835.62 → 9840.10] should probably check in and see how it's going the developer's super cool Canadian it's their first game
[9840.10 → 9849.62] um seem really passionate, and it reminded me of playing like NHLPA 93 uh, but you know fun and
[9849.62 → 9857.14] modern and with kind of new with a new twist on it um so you know nostalgia can be a perfect one
[9857.70 → 9866.02] uh another great example of that is how many incredible like um pixel art like 16-bit pixel art
[9866.02 → 9871.14] games there are that sorts of emulate the style of classics like Final Fantasy 6 krone trigger
[9871.70 → 9877.38] um a couple that sort of stood out to me sea of stars seems like they were a really passionate team
[9877.86 → 9883.78] I quite enjoyed the game I didn't think it was quite as good as people kind of made it out to be it was a
[9883.78 → 9889.30] little shallow in terms of the gameplay and I won't say much about the story but I will say that there were
[9889.30 → 9897.86] just aspects of it that um you know whatever but the music is incredible the art is beautiful um it
[9897.86 → 9905.22] absolutely worth a play through if you enjoy uh if you enjoy that that art style if you enjoy um that era
[9905.22 → 9912.10] of gaming another perfect one this one I cannot recommend enough what a beautiful game so
[9912.10 → 9919.94] incredibly well written uh cross code um radical fish I think is coming out with their next game like
[9919.94 → 9927.70] soon is huh but in the meantime you should definitely pick this up it is just an outstanding
[9927.70 → 9936.02] game uh and then what's what's the last one that i really enjoyed um 16-bit pixel games
[9936.02 → 9942.90] oh man uh I'm trying to remember what it was
[9945.38 → 9949.62] there was another perfect one that I played a little while ago where the writing got kind of
[9949.62 → 9956.90] silly after a bit um but in like uh in like an anime way that a lot of people will probably like
[9958.82 → 9964.98] I can't remember well I will, I'll have to I'll have to get that for you guys another time, but it's
[9964.98 → 9972.58] like turn-based combat world exploration no, no one's uh no one said it yet yeah
[9974.82 → 9981.46] well anyway yeah so, so yeah, so nostalgia can be a perfect way to kind of reignite the
[9981.46 → 9987.14] the passion finding something that is both new and has reminders of old uh another huge one
[9987.94 → 9993.94] would be just people uh a huge part of what I enjoyed so much about playing tape to tape was
[9993.94 → 9998.98] socializing so using it as a way to connect with people whether they're part of your life now or
[9998.98 → 10003.78] whether they're people that used to be part of your life I'd say that gaming chained echoes that's
[10003.78 → 10010.42] the one thanks crater chained echoes also really cool uh definitely enjoyed the combat of chained
[10010.42 → 10017.54] echoes a little bit more than um than sea of stars I played them both like back to back around the same time
[10017.54 → 10026.18] chained echoes is super cool how is this so cheap chained echoes is 10 us dollars right now winter sale
[10026.18 → 10035.14] heck yeah steam being mean to everyone's wallets yeah dude it's so good yeah it's perfect anyway
[10035.70 → 10040.42] a couple more yeah connecting with people that that'll probably help get you back into it
[10040.42 → 10046.74] playing games with my kids is lots of fun although now that my son is so much better than me and my
[10046.74 → 10053.22] girls still aren't good enough to like to compete it's hard to play like competitive games with them
[10053.22 → 10058.98] but it's still it's still great to just enjoy you know stories um also with the wife we
[10058.98 → 10063.70] played unravel 2 recently and we played uh it takes two a little while back people
[10066.26 → 10074.74] happy holidays tech gents love the new screwdrivers great for gifting what is one of your tech pet peeves
[10074.74 → 10084.42] workers smashing their mobile pay kiosks into my phone for tap to pay is mine cheers oh man a tech pet
[10084.42 → 10090.90] peeve I'd say the biggest one for me in my daily life has got to be password autofill that just like
[10090.90 → 10098.98] doesn't work um that doesn't detect the right app or the right website like it is feels like it is works
[10098.98 → 10106.34] every time 75 of the time and when it works dude password autofill and pass keys' oh man pass keys I was
[10106.34 → 10114.82] talking about this before the show pass keys are such a failed promise man like in theory they were
[10114.82 → 10122.26] supposed to make it so that I didn't have to do like passwords and two-factor because the whole thing was
[10122.26 → 10128.98] supposed to be just like this thing that is on me that I have already authenticated I'm using and it
[10128.98 → 10136.66] this is my one factor my thing I have and then um the thing that I am is supposed to be the biometric
[10136.66 → 10140.82] authentication that was supposed to be it and I'm supposed to just automagically log into everything
[10140.82 → 10147.06] in practice I went to log into something that used a pass key before the show started
[10147.06 → 10151.38] and what is it so I have to enter I had to enter my password that I've memorized because it is my
[10151.38 → 10157.38] like single sign on one so I had to enter my password and then in order to authenticate that
[10157.38 → 10165.62] I had to um unlock my phone to so I had to click scan QR code I'm going to do it that way then I had to
[10165.62 → 10170.90] unlock my phone then I had to click it then I had to say what I was logging into then I had to
[10170.90 → 10176.74] biometrically authenticate again then I had to click yes, and then it was like seven steps later I might as
[10176.74 → 10183.14] well have just typed an eight character password at that point it's ridiculous um so i I'd say
[10183.14 → 10191.06] that's definitely one of mine and the last one I have today question for Linus from a fellow motorcyclist
[10191.06 → 10199.70] have you ridden the Suzuki CSX 8s spiritual successor to your sv650 love seeing a live Sancho
[10199.70 → 10206.10] merry Christmas from Scotland hey thanks merry Christmas to you too Scotland no I haven't this
[10206.10 → 10212.98] thing looks sick though like damn this thing looks awesome um
[10217.70 → 10224.74] look at that dang there are so many cool bikes I wish I was allowed to get a motorcycle my mommy says no
[10226.10 → 10230.98] um yeah wow this looks awesome no this had completely
[10230.98 → 10236.10] um this had completely flown under my radar
[10238.34 → 10246.82] is it uh oh here we go uh oh okay is it a v twin or is it an inline does anyone know
[10250.34 → 10256.58] anyone Bueller uh well I'll wait for I'll wait for someone to respond in chat but no that thing
[10256.58 → 10263.78] looks sick I haven't been on my I haven't been on my SV, and we're coming up on like three years but
[10263.78 → 10271.62] the paint job is done, but there's terrible news about the paint job um I don't think that my base
[10271.62 → 10277.94] colour layer adhered properly to my primer layer on some of the parts and I think it's basically just gonna
[10277.94 → 10288.18] like crack off after a season or two which is uh deeply disheartening i you know I tried
[10289.94 → 10296.26] I tried to do my I tried to learn the air sprayer and i I tried to learn all the coatings and
[10296.26 → 10302.02] I tried to have the right conditions and everything but I think I just got caught one day when maybe i
[10302.02 → 10307.62] I didn't get the temperature right or maybe I didn't get the mix right and it just didn't adhere
[10307.62 → 10313.22] uh so some of the parts are fine to the point where they're like so hard to strip that I like
[10313.22 → 10319.22] destroyed a part once trying to strip paint off of it and redo it because I screwed up the uh the effect layer
[10319.86 → 10325.14] and then others are just like oh my god these are just gonna these are just going to flake off so I think
[10325.14 → 10328.98] I'm probably only going to get a couple of seasons out of if it was a fun learning experience
[10328.98 → 10334.34] and then I think next time around I've actually got a buddy who is into badminton and also
[10334.34 → 10340.82] runs a paint shop I'm just going to be like hey Danny uh this time can I just come into your shop and
[10340.82 → 10346.58] do like a couple hour session with you and maybe use your shop and maybe here are a few bucks or some
[10346.58 → 10352.42] free time at smash champs or something and let's work out a tit-for-tat and I'll maybe I'll just you
[10352.42 → 10356.34] know do something else let Danny do it no that's no fun
[10356.34 → 10363.94] yeah that's that's boring that's boring I want to ride around on a bike that I painted
[10363.94 → 10367.22] so maybe next time around it'll be a GSTs what do these cost anyway
[10368.18 → 10370.82] oh i never check chat is it a v twin or is it an inline
[10372.50 → 10376.26] somebody in twitch had said parallel twin I don't know if they're lying to you
[10376.26 → 10383.86] uh MSRP starting from question mark what the devil does that mean
[10386.18 → 10390.42] prices of products on the site are manufacturers suggested blah blah blah yeah yeah yeah I get it
[10390.42 → 10392.82] you might have to build one out, but you didn't give me one
[10395.06 → 10402.18] oh, oh okay hold on location British Columbia dude man bikes are oh man the hell
[10402.18 → 10406.98] like that's like new yeah eleven thousand dollars to be clear is a lot of money I guess you only get
[10406.98 → 10411.94] two wheels, but that's Canadian dollars, so this is like this is like eight grand or something
[10411.94 → 10420.42] like that and like man compared to four-wheel vehicles you can buy so much
[10420.42 → 10427.30] you can buy so much fun on a bike compared to a four-wheel vehicle for the price like good lord
[10427.30 → 10437.06] dude oh wow that's an oh that's a big engine I didn't clue in that the eight was 800 uh cc's
[10438.50 → 10444.26] that's more that's 200 more than cappuccino 776 cc's
[10447.30 → 10451.78] I don't know guys do you really want me to be like the game dev guy who died recently
[10451.78 → 10459.14] because i 650 was already freaking a lot for me man it's got ride by wire abs
[10460.66 → 10465.94] low rpm assist interesting for smoother and easier starts okay that I don't know if i
[10465.94 → 10470.74] need as much but sure damn this thing looks so cool
[10470.74 → 10481.62] all right I'm gonna I'm gonna um you know not buy it though maybe this
[10481.62 → 10481.94] heck
[10484.82 → 10487.14] this thing looks sick uh okay
[10490.34 → 10496.98] uh oh is that it that's all I got for you oh wow okay well hey uh one last shout

[10547.94 → 10552.82] both the engineering team to talk about some of the really wild products that never saw the light
[10552.82 → 10558.26] of day and with the fashion team to talk about some of the really cool products that never
[10558.26 → 10564.90] saw the light of day and the various reasons that they didn't I don't want to spoil too much but the
