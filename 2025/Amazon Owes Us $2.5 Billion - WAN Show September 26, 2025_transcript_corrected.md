[0.00 → 3.78] What is up, ladies and gentlemen?
[4.52 → 5.78] Welcome to WAN Show Theatre.
[6.44 → 8.72] I'll be your host, Linus Sebastian,
[9.32 → 11.22] and Luke will be there,
[11.50 → 13.74] and I will probably talk over him a lot.
[15.08 → 18.16] But not right now, because he isn't talking.
[19.10 → 21.68] We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[22.10 → 25.78] One of the big headline topics this week is, of course,
[25.78 → 30.36] that Amazon will pay $2.5 billion
[30.36 → 36.84] in a settlement for their prime subscription traps.
[37.20 → 38.68] Freaking got them.
[39.10 → 40.98] Probably not enough, but hey,
[41.08 → 43.94] at least it's some semblance of justice.
[44.28 → 46.30] In other news, this is cool,
[46.68 → 50.60] Google reveals that its Android PC is coming in 2026.
[50.74 → 53.70] That's right, the often rumoured merging
[53.70 → 56.38] of Android and Chrome OS
[56.38 → 61.32] into one dark, unholy, ad-driven platform.
[62.52 → 64.94] Well, doesn't sound like that's quite what's happening.
[65.44 → 66.08] So...
[66.08 → 67.98] I was so mesmerized by your speech,
[68.16 → 69.84] I don't have anything repaired at all.
[69.98 → 70.40] Nice!
[70.52 → 71.24] That was fascinating.
[73.54 → 74.58] Spam GPT?
[76.10 → 77.80] Is a thing, and it's going to suck.
[78.00 → 79.30] And I think it might already be happening.
[79.38 → 80.98] Actually, it looks perfect.
[81.30 → 81.62] What?
[81.70 → 82.40] Which is bad.
[82.40 → 83.66] Oh, yeah.
[84.66 → 85.74] Yeah, big time.
[86.50 → 89.40] The other one is...
[90.40 → 93.50] Oh, this made me question things.
[93.62 → 94.58] We'll read more about it.
[95.02 → 96.76] Ascent Rivals, the game I showed out last week,
[96.82 → 98.88] has, like, really strong crypto connections, maybe?
[99.60 → 101.56] Oh, that's a headline topic?
[102.08 → 102.52] No.
[102.64 → 103.24] It doesn't matter.
[103.24 → 104.24] The point is...
[104.24 → 129.18] The show is brought to you today by Corsair, Factor, and Rove Lab.
[129.18 → 134.24] Along with our rap partner, Brandt, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[134.60 → 136.96] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic?
[137.02 → 139.78] This is a really great, uncharacteristically good question.
[140.10 → 144.82] From YouTube chat, and the scrolling broke.
[144.92 → 145.10] Nope.
[145.10 → 152.22] Chari Combat says, Amazon owes everyone $2.5 billion, or Amazon owes you $2.5 billion?
[152.82 → 153.14] Us.
[153.24 → 154.46] The collective us.
[154.50 → 155.32] That's the title.
[155.56 → 155.70] Yeah.
[155.70 → 157.52] Amazon owes us $2.5 billion.
[157.66 → 162.86] And us, actually, in this case, doesn't even include us, because this appears to be a U.S. thing.
[162.86 → 169.66] To settle an FTC lawsuit that accused Amazon of deceptive prime enrolment and cancellation strategies,
[170.06 → 172.06] the company will end the practice.
[172.26 → 175.34] This is a nice little W, we call it.
[175.66 → 180.24] Will end the practice and pay a $1 billion civil penalty,
[180.60 → 187.14] and send out $1.5 billion in refunds to 35 million customers.
[187.14 → 193.54] It is the largest FTC penalty ever in a case involving an FTC rule violation,
[193.80 → 199.68] and the refunds are the second-highest restitution award ever obtained by FTC action.
[200.16 → 202.96] So, bravo, FTC.
[203.30 → 208.82] I mean, Luke and I, and everyone knows how Amazon Prime and Barley grows.
[209.00 → 214.46] Like, it has been such an obvious, blatantly anti-consumer approach
[214.46 → 216.58] that Amazon has taken with their Prime subscriptions.
[216.58 → 219.26] Pretty much since ever.
[220.08 → 222.46] And the kinds of mazes that they created.
[222.68 → 225.94] Wasn't it your grandfather that couldn't figure out how to cancel his Prime,
[225.98 → 228.60] and he had, like, multiple subscriptions or something like that?
[228.74 → 228.86] Yeah.
[229.12 → 231.84] Like, the whole thing was just nasty.
[232.10 → 235.96] And it's nice to see for freaking once,
[236.72 → 237.96] for freaking once,
[237.96 → 243.22] these agencies actually hold companies' account with nice big fines
[243.22 → 248.66] that might actually incentivize them to do things properly going forward.
[248.76 → 254.86] Now, I obviously would have preferred if that one-click-to-cancel thing had gone through,
[254.96 → 255.40] because...
[255.40 → 255.96] Yeah, big time.
[255.96 → 257.54] Like, we're in Canada, right?
[257.60 → 262.14] So, we don't necessarily benefit from things that the FTC does in the US.
[262.98 → 264.56] Except that a lot of the time we do.
[264.98 → 267.98] Because whatever flies in a company's biggest market
[267.98 → 271.94] tends to kind of trickle over into various other markets.
[272.02 → 273.96] It's one of the reasons that I...
[273.96 → 276.44] It's often not worth building all the differentiation.
[276.44 → 281.08] I'm holding this iPhone right now that has a USB-C port on the bottom.
[281.30 → 283.88] Because you can bet your bottom dollar
[283.88 → 287.10] that if the EU wasn't a large enough market for Apple,
[287.32 → 290.00] they would have either just sort of flipped them off
[290.00 → 291.64] and not bothered to ship iPhones there,
[291.92 → 293.98] or they would have...
[293.98 → 296.66] Actually, no, I guess this has nothing to do with them being a large enough market.
[296.72 → 299.54] But the point is, they could have also segmented them out
[299.54 → 301.96] and just had lightning everywhere else in the USB there.
[302.10 → 305.70] But clearly, the EU was big enough for them to not just walk away from it,
[305.70 → 307.52] and not...
[307.52 → 308.44] Yeah, that's it.
[308.48 → 311.70] Not just walk away from it and refuse to make a USB phone.
[311.70 → 313.26] I suspect they were worried about...
[313.26 → 313.98] Cap...
[313.98 → 314.82] Copycat?
[315.00 → 317.76] I think they were worried about copycat action
[317.76 → 320.50] and wanted to get out ahead of it.
[321.12 → 321.56] Copycat?
[321.66 → 321.86] Yeah.
[322.28 → 324.10] If, like, the US did the same thing.
[324.12 → 324.58] Oh, sure.
[324.76 → 324.96] Yeah.
[325.08 → 325.82] And then...
[325.82 → 326.74] Because if they do...
[326.74 → 328.42] If they don't have that happen,
[328.42 → 331.50] then I think they're at lower risk of other things being thrown at them.
[332.46 → 332.62] Yeah.
[332.74 → 333.06] Anyway.
[333.06 → 339.84] The FTC specifically requires Amazon to use a clear and conspicuous button
[339.84 → 341.50] for customers to decline prime
[341.50 → 346.72] and stop using buttons as cancellation deterrence with texts such as,
[347.64 → 350.22] no, I don't want free shipping.
[350.56 → 353.38] They need to go after a lot of other places then, too.
[353.76 → 354.46] Uh, yep.
[354.46 → 357.00] Because there's, like, if you book a flight, it's always like,
[357.14 → 359.86] no, I want to be, like, unsafe or whatever.
[359.86 → 363.16] Like, I don't want my trip to be whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[363.28 → 363.68] Oh, dude.
[363.76 → 364.28] Just relax.
[364.96 → 365.86] Like, ugh!
[366.32 → 366.64] I had...
[366.64 → 367.20] I had...
[367.20 → 370.00] I was trying to close Lenovo Vantage today.
[370.94 → 374.38] And it was like, do you want it to show up in your system tray?
[375.14 → 376.96] And it was yes or later.
[378.88 → 381.26] Which seemed so crazy to me.
[381.52 → 382.78] I was like, what does later mean?
[382.78 → 386.84] I clicked later to figure it out, and later was just no.
[386.98 → 390.34] Dude, any message on any one of my devices
[390.34 → 392.72] that doesn't have a do not show this again
[392.72 → 395.98] makes me want to just freaking...
[395.98 → 398.78] Dude, I get this notification from my watch
[398.78 → 400.90] like every other day
[400.90 → 403.10] that's like high power usage
[403.10 → 405.12] when you always use on screen
[405.12 → 406.20] and do all this stuff
[406.20 → 408.40] that makes your watch work as a watch.
[408.40 → 410.58] And all I can do is dismiss it.
[410.84 → 413.06] I can't say, I don't care.
[413.52 → 414.08] Never ever...
[414.08 → 414.74] Oh, here it is.
[415.02 → 416.22] High power usage.
[417.28 → 418.56] My only option...
[418.56 → 419.12] Check this out.
[419.18 → 420.40] My only option is...
[421.28 → 422.56] Got it.
[423.92 → 424.80] That's it.
[425.90 → 427.82] I have clicked got it
[427.82 → 430.46] 100 bazillion times
[430.46 → 433.28] since I started using the OnePlus 2R.
[433.42 → 434.44] Now, okay.
[434.94 → 437.46] I don't want to go off the rails here.
[437.46 → 438.74] I don't want to go off the rails
[438.74 → 440.90] and see if there's...
[440.90 → 442.84] And say something that's not right.
[443.30 → 444.62] So I'll happily...
[444.62 → 445.02] I don't know.
[445.26 → 445.66] Apps?
[445.84 → 446.76] App notifications?
[447.18 → 447.78] Show all?
[447.88 → 448.08] No?
[448.20 → 448.42] Okay.
[448.84 → 450.70] So if there's something in here
[450.70 → 451.84] that gives me the option
[451.84 → 454.00] to not have it warn me about that,
[454.12 → 456.88] then get notified
[456.88 → 458.60] when battery use issues are found.
[458.72 → 460.04] Okay, I did find that in settings.
[460.16 → 461.10] Is that?
[461.36 → 462.08] Either way,
[462.44 → 463.94] when you give me a notification,
[463.94 → 465.60] I don't want to have to go
[465.60 → 467.70] digging three levels into a menu
[467.70 → 468.58] to say,
[468.70 → 470.68] I don't care about this notification.
[470.68 → 470.94] Yeah.
[471.20 → 472.56] Never send it to me again.
[473.66 → 475.78] I'd love to talk about Microsoft Teams.
[476.36 → 476.80] Sure.
[478.34 → 482.08] Every single cot-tang time,
[482.50 → 484.20] I sign in to Teams on my account,
[484.46 → 485.32] which is a lot
[485.32 → 486.90] because I have my home computer.
[487.24 → 488.20] I have my laptop.
[488.58 → 489.78] I have my work computer.
[490.10 → 490.78] I have my phone.
[490.86 → 491.56] Actually, you know what?
[491.58 → 492.88] It's pretty good about not signing in.
[492.88 → 493.64] No, actually, no.
[493.68 → 494.72] It does sign you out on the phone for a bit.
[495.00 → 496.90] So I sign in to Teams a lot.
[497.00 → 498.14] It's kind of a hobby for me,
[498.40 → 499.72] signing in to Microsoft Teams.
[500.58 → 501.78] Every time I sign in,
[501.84 → 502.30] it asks,
[502.68 → 503.12] Oh, yeah.
[503.12 → 504.62] Do you want to let the organization
[504.62 → 506.46] manage your device?
[506.98 → 508.32] And it also asks,
[508.54 → 509.88] do you want to sign in
[509.88 → 511.22] system-wide
[511.22 → 512.22] or just this app?
[512.66 → 514.00] It asks you that every time?
[514.00 → 517.50] Every single time.
[517.64 → 518.28] That's actually weird.
[518.38 → 519.94] I do not have that experience.
[520.38 → 520.74] Then,
[521.00 → 522.40] and this is fun,
[522.78 → 523.52] then it asks,
[524.00 → 524.30] hey,
[524.90 → 526.40] do you want to stay signed in
[526.40 → 528.24] so you don't have to do this all the time?
[528.38 → 529.44] And I click yes.
[529.80 → 531.44] I know it isn't going to work,
[531.70 → 533.20] but I click it anyway.
[533.40 → 534.20] I click yes every time.
[534.20 → 535.54] I click yes every time
[535.54 → 537.60] because I do not want
[537.60 → 538.44] to be prompted
[538.44 → 539.84] to sign in constantly.
[540.22 → 540.66] Someday,
[540.92 → 541.86] I dream.
[542.10 → 543.20] I dream of a day
[543.20 → 544.80] when that button will work.
[546.54 → 547.58] It'll be grand.
[547.90 → 548.56] It is not this day.
[549.14 → 550.74] But it is not this day.
[552.60 → 554.46] The courage of Microsoft
[554.46 → 556.50] to keep giving me the same message
[556.50 → 557.34] will fail.
[557.68 → 559.86] But it is not this day.
[560.04 → 560.40] I do wonder,
[560.48 → 560.62] like,
[560.70 → 561.88] I read a headline,
[563.10 → 566.52] Microsoft splitting off
[566.52 → 568.74] teams from Office 365.
[568.74 → 568.90] Yeah,
[568.94 → 570.02] that's the thing in the EU now,
[570.06 → 570.28] right?
[570.28 → 572.14] But I thought this was going to end up
[572.14 → 573.18] happening everywhere.
[573.56 → 573.86] Man,
[573.90 → 574.44] we're talking about,
[574.56 → 574.64] like,
[574.76 → 575.74] clicking too many things.
[575.96 → 576.88] I Google that,
[577.06 → 577.78] and Google's like,
[577.82 → 579.16] do you want to try AI mode?
[579.30 → 579.72] And it's like,
[580.08 → 580.54] no!
[580.76 → 580.98] No!
[581.70 → 582.94] Get out of my way.
[584.94 → 585.46] Ugh.
[585.46 → 587.38] Yes,
[587.50 → 588.54] Microsoft is in the process
[588.54 → 589.90] of unbundling Microsoft Teams
[589.90 → 591.20] from its Office 365
[591.20 → 592.44] and Microsoft 365
[592.44 → 594.18] enterprise suites globally.
[594.98 → 595.34] Wow!
[596.56 → 597.04] Nice!
[597.22 → 597.58] Apparently,
[597.66 → 599.44] it'll become a...
[599.44 → 600.38] Oh,
[600.46 → 601.24] for new customers.
[601.40 → 601.76] Okay, okay.
[601.80 → 602.34] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[603.16 → 603.84] But yeah,
[603.86 → 605.00] I think this is going to happen
[605.00 → 605.80] to everyone eventually.
[606.04 → 606.96] I'm really wondering
[606.96 → 608.14] what that's going to do
[608.14 → 608.60] to Teams,
[608.68 → 609.86] because Teams is,
[610.04 → 610.82] in my opinion,
[610.98 → 612.02] just objectively
[612.02 → 613.22] not a very good
[613.22 → 614.24] communications platform
[614.24 → 615.40] for, like,
[615.46 → 616.50] a bunch of reasons.
[616.86 → 617.16] Tons.
[617.28 → 617.88] We've gone over them
[617.88 → 618.66] many times before.
[618.66 → 618.82] His take,
[618.90 → 619.32] not mine.
[619.86 → 620.82] I don't disagree,
[620.98 → 621.74] but...
[621.74 → 623.56] The word objectively
[623.56 → 624.48] is kind of scary.
[624.64 → 624.80] Like,
[625.10 → 626.02] you could say something
[626.02 → 626.96] as simple as,
[627.20 → 627.96] objectively,
[628.64 → 630.18] this frequency response curve
[630.18 → 631.86] is even farther outside
[631.86 → 632.56] of what would be
[632.56 → 634.14] an ideal frequency response curve,
[634.30 → 635.32] and people would get,
[635.44 → 635.52] like,
[635.56 → 636.88] really f***ING mad about it.
[637.40 → 637.84] Like,
[637.86 → 638.46] you could say something
[638.46 → 639.30] as simple as that.
[639.30 → 639.40] I can actually explain
[639.40 → 640.38] why I say that, though.
[640.54 → 640.70] Yeah.
[640.70 → 641.18] Because,
[642.26 → 643.12] in communication,
[643.54 → 643.84] there's,
[643.90 → 644.40] you know how there's,
[644.52 → 644.58] like,
[644.60 → 645.32] the whole body language
[645.32 → 645.86] and stuff like that?
[646.04 → 647.44] It is difficult to tell
[647.44 → 648.44] if things are working
[648.44 → 649.40] in Teams.
[649.86 → 650.14] They,
[650.14 → 650.70] they...
[650.70 → 651.36] Because it's like this?
[651.36 → 652.20] They seem to have...
[652.20 → 653.12] It's got all the body language?
[654.04 → 654.48] No.
[654.88 → 655.18] It's,
[655.32 → 655.60] there's,
[655.60 → 656.80] there are things like the
[656.98 → 657.20] you know,
[657.26 → 657.52] okay,
[657.66 → 659.00] the box around your picture
[659.00 → 659.98] has,
[660.12 → 660.20] like,
[660.24 → 660.78] a border
[660.78 → 661.70] that lights up
[661.70 → 662.72] when your mic
[662.72 → 663.30] is activated
[663.30 → 664.30] for the other person.
[664.52 → 664.80] So,
[664.92 → 665.56] the other person
[665.56 → 666.54] looking at you talking,
[666.82 → 667.50] your little box
[667.50 → 668.04] will have the thing.
[668.36 → 668.60] Okay,
[668.72 → 669.00] cool.
[669.30 → 669.92] Sounds good.
[671.08 → 672.64] Almost every other platform
[672.64 → 674.16] just does the same thing
[674.16 → 674.66] for you.
[674.84 → 675.10] Yeah.
[675.96 → 676.72] Teams does not.
[676.82 → 677.28] Unacceptable.
[677.46 → 678.92] They finally listened to it.
[679.00 → 679.20] Okay,
[679.26 → 680.14] but I have a real problem
[680.14 → 680.16] with Teams.
[680.16 → 681.02] They listened to the feedback
[681.02 → 682.62] and they decided to make it
[682.62 → 684.96] so that the mute icon microphone
[684.96 → 685.94] way up in the corner
[685.94 → 687.78] will slightly fill up
[687.78 → 689.42] whenever you're talking.
[689.58 → 689.76] No.
[689.84 → 690.36] Which is...
[690.36 → 690.56] No,
[690.70 → 690.96] no.
[690.96 → 692.52] Just terrible.
[692.70 → 693.56] I have a real complaint
[693.56 → 694.10] about Teams.
[694.92 → 695.90] Teams is trying
[695.90 → 697.12] to destroy my monitor.
[698.60 → 699.04] So,
[699.14 → 700.08] I have an OLED at home.
[700.52 → 700.90] Okay.
[701.34 → 701.78] And,
[701.86 → 702.76] one of the things
[702.76 → 703.42] that I do
[703.42 → 704.52] to keep my OLED,
[704.74 → 705.02] you know,
[705.14 → 706.10] not burned in
[706.10 → 707.42] is I auto-hide
[707.42 → 708.08] my taskbar.
[708.80 → 710.12] If I have an unread
[710.12 → 711.10] message in Teams,
[711.70 → 712.62] my taskbar
[712.62 → 713.64] will not hide.
[715.44 → 716.24] Drives me
[716.24 → 717.42] absolutely
[717.42 → 719.20] bat crap crazy
[719.20 → 720.12] because it could be
[720.12 → 720.60] a message
[720.60 → 721.66] that I have already
[721.66 → 722.18] addressed
[722.18 → 723.18] on my phone.
[724.04 → 724.88] But my taskbar
[724.88 → 725.52] will just be open.
[726.12 → 727.08] They're trying to burn
[727.08 → 727.86] the taskbar
[727.86 → 729.00] into my monitor.
[729.28 → 729.50] Yeah.
[729.70 → 729.90] So,
[730.00 → 730.60] I can't use
[730.60 → 731.66] auto-hide taskbar.
[732.30 → 733.20] Teams feels
[733.20 → 734.28] extremely half-baked
[734.28 → 734.70] to me.
[738.04 → 738.48] Yeah,
[738.62 → 739.06] I don't know.
[739.18 → 739.98] I could genuinely
[739.98 → 740.58] talk about it
[740.58 → 741.38] for like hours.
[741.74 → 742.46] Flat out wrong.
[742.78 → 743.26] Nothing provides
[743.26 → 744.38] better integrated platform.
[745.16 → 746.00] That matters more
[746.00 → 746.70] in enterprise,
[746.82 → 747.40] bigger companies,
[747.52 → 747.82] compliance,
[748.10 → 748.98] smaller companies,
[749.20 → 749.64] Do you want me
[749.64 → 750.00] to ban him?
[750.12 → 750.58] I'll ban him.
[750.60 → 750.82] No,
[750.94 → 751.70] that just has nothing
[751.70 → 752.50] to do at all
[752.50 → 752.98] with what I was
[752.98 → 753.48] talking about.
[753.56 → 753.62] So,
[753.66 → 754.12] it doesn't really
[754.12 → 754.42] matter.
[754.58 → 755.80] But the thing
[755.80 → 756.38] that I was discussing
[756.38 → 757.40] was Teams itself
[757.40 → 759.08] and Teams being good,
[759.14 → 759.88] not its ability
[759.88 → 760.22] to integrate
[760.22 → 760.74] with other things.
[760.94 → 761.48] Its ability to
[761.48 → 762.00] integrate with other
[762.00 → 763.50] things is pretty good.
[763.70 → 764.34] I don't think it's
[764.34 → 765.36] actually necessarily
[765.36 → 766.02] the best.
[768.00 → 768.64] But yeah,
[768.72 → 769.68] that just actually
[769.68 → 770.28] has nothing to do
[770.28 → 770.30] with my argument.
[770.30 → 771.14] And to be clear,
[771.34 → 772.52] we obviously
[772.52 → 773.50] choose to use it.
[773.82 → 774.14] Yeah,
[774.32 → 775.32] because it's cheap
[775.32 → 775.88] as dirt,
[776.12 → 776.94] which is the reason
[776.94 → 777.68] why almost everyone
[777.68 → 778.16] uses it.
[778.16 → 779.30] And a lot of companies
[779.30 → 780.34] need something else
[780.34 → 781.42] that's in Office 365,
[781.76 → 782.58] which is again
[782.58 → 783.80] why they end up
[783.80 → 784.72] using it.
[786.52 → 787.82] It's like
[787.82 → 789.66] used out of convenience.
[789.66 → 790.62] It's used out of
[790.62 → 791.44] the reasons that
[791.44 → 792.62] Handyman just pointed out,
[792.68 → 793.34] which is that it's like
[793.34 → 794.50] integrated with so many
[794.50 → 795.12] other things.
[795.40 → 796.18] It's almost like
[796.18 → 797.04] that's why Microsoft
[797.04 → 798.24] managed to get to
[798.24 → 799.06] where they are today
[799.06 → 799.34] at all.
[799.66 → 800.50] Because it's there.
[800.84 → 801.74] It's not used
[801.74 → 802.96] because it's good.
[802.96 → 804.10] And I'm wondering
[804.10 → 805.00] if that will be
[805.00 → 806.24] really changing at all
[806.24 → 807.74] with this decoupling.
[807.92 → 809.16] I seriously doubt it
[809.16 → 810.46] because even if it's
[810.46 → 810.96] decoupled,
[811.10 → 812.34] it's still there
[812.34 → 813.42] and it will still
[813.42 → 814.52] just work
[814.52 → 815.24] with a lot of
[815.24 → 815.70] the other things
[815.70 → 816.48] that most companies
[816.48 → 817.26] happen to need.
[817.88 → 818.16] So...
[818.16 → 818.78] It's remarkable
[818.78 → 819.82] how often
[819.82 → 820.62] the first like
[820.62 → 821.40] six seconds
[821.40 → 822.18] of a Teams call
[822.18 → 822.82] are cut off.
[823.12 → 823.42] Yep.
[824.00 → 824.84] WhatsApp works.
[825.54 → 825.86] Yep.
[826.80 → 828.06] I was trying to think
[828.06 → 828.72] of something else
[828.72 → 829.44] that doesn't work.
[829.52 → 830.20] Like FaceTime.
[830.72 → 831.24] Can you remember
[831.24 → 831.98] the last time
[831.98 → 833.60] you made a FaceTime call?
[834.06 → 834.60] And just like
[834.60 → 835.58] the first five seconds
[835.58 → 836.54] of it was both sides
[836.54 → 836.88] being like
[836.88 → 837.36] can you hear me?
[837.40 → 837.84] Can you hear me?
[837.88 → 838.30] Can you hear me?
[838.34 → 838.80] Can you hear me?
[839.24 → 840.02] It happens
[840.02 → 842.06] constantly on Teams.
[842.06 → 842.18] That happens to me
[842.18 → 842.88] on literally
[842.88 → 843.56] no other
[843.56 → 844.40] modern communication
[844.40 → 844.88] platform
[844.88 → 845.82] other than Teams
[845.82 → 846.52] and it is a
[846.52 → 847.22] constant problem
[847.22 → 847.66] on Teams.
[847.94 → 848.38] That's great.
[848.50 → 849.06] Chat be like
[849.06 → 849.86] it has a built-in
[849.86 → 850.76] millennial pause.
[851.32 → 852.34] Yeah, it really does.
[852.80 → 853.66] Teams seems to be
[853.66 → 854.60] really obsessive
[854.60 → 856.60] about screwing around
[856.60 → 857.56] with your audio devices
[857.56 → 859.08] in really weird ways
[859.08 → 859.66] as well
[859.66 → 860.84] which is odd
[860.84 → 861.42] and doesn't make
[861.42 → 862.10] any sense to me.
[862.26 → 863.26] Alright, Teams is boring
[863.26 → 863.90] let's move on.
[864.04 → 864.34] Yeah.
[865.06 → 866.52] Why don't we talk instead
[866.52 → 867.82] about how Microsoft
[867.82 → 869.72] will be using AI
[869.72 → 871.84] to make AI better.
[872.26 → 873.44] Okay, that sounds
[873.44 → 874.58] really boring and sucky
[874.58 → 875.54] but hold on
[875.54 → 876.04] it gets good.
[876.06 → 876.68] It's actually incredibly interesting.
[877.08 → 879.16] With micro fluidic
[879.16 → 880.56] cooling channels
[880.56 → 882.04] Microsoft
[882.04 → 883.92] is using AI
[883.92 → 885.48] to map hotspots
[885.48 → 885.92] do you want to click
[885.92 → 886.68] the Microsoft announcement?
[886.80 → 886.94] Sure.
[886.94 → 887.34] I think they had some
[887.34 → 887.86] pictures in there.
[887.96 → 888.20] Yes.
[888.20 → 889.68] is using AI
[889.68 → 891.26] to map hotspots
[891.26 → 892.78] in its AI accelerators
[892.78 → 894.06] individually
[894.06 → 895.04] so that is
[895.04 → 897.16] on each unique chip
[897.16 → 898.44] then
[898.44 → 900.26] laser etching
[900.26 → 902.02] hair-sized channels
[902.02 → 903.38] to pump
[903.38 → 904.12] coolant
[904.12 → 904.72] through them.
[905.20 → 906.28] The channels
[906.28 → 907.30] bring coolant
[907.30 → 908.88] into direct contact
[908.88 → 909.94] with the silicon.
[910.88 → 911.86] Microsoft says
[911.86 → 913.16] inside the silicon.
[913.64 → 914.36] Forbes says
[914.36 → 915.52] passing over it.
[915.52 → 916.94] Forbes is almost
[916.94 → 918.36] certainly more correct
[918.36 → 919.38] than Microsoft here.
[919.64 → 920.46] Sorry Microsoft.
[920.78 → 921.62] Inside the silicon
[921.62 → 922.42] would break it.
[923.32 → 924.50] Both the method
[924.50 → 925.38] and the AI
[925.38 → 926.32] are from specialized
[926.32 → 927.38] Swiss startup
[927.38 → 928.48] Corinth.
[929.06 → 930.30] Microsoft has claimed
[930.30 → 932.34] a 3x improvement
[932.34 → 933.02] to cooling
[933.02 → 933.92] compared to
[933.92 → 935.34] traditional cold plates.
[935.86 → 936.36] The channels
[936.36 → 937.60] need to be deep enough
[937.60 → 938.60] to circulate coolant
[938.60 → 939.34] without clogging
[939.34 → 941.00] but not weaken
[941.00 → 941.86] the silicon enough
[941.86 → 942.76] to break.
[942.76 → 944.40] four design iterations
[944.40 → 945.30] were produced
[945.30 → 946.72] in just the last year
[946.72 → 947.74] and the chips
[947.74 → 949.12] needed to be designed
[949.12 → 951.22] with a leak-proof package.
[951.96 → 952.52] What?
[952.96 → 953.82] That's wild.
[954.18 → 954.52] Dude,
[955.14 → 956.56] this is so cool.
[956.88 → 957.08] Yeah,
[957.22 → 957.60] I was worried
[957.60 → 958.34] about playing the video
[958.34 → 958.74] because...
[958.74 → 959.02] Yeah, whatever.
[959.10 → 959.74] It's from Microsoft.
[959.90 → 960.44] It should be fine.
[961.80 → 962.74] That's probably true.
[962.74 → 962.76] Realistically,
[962.88 → 963.74] for Microsoft
[963.74 → 964.74] to be like...
[964.74 → 965.16] Isn't that nuts?
[965.36 → 965.62] Like,
[965.88 → 966.42] go back.
[966.48 → 967.08] Go back to that.
[967.18 → 967.86] That was...
[967.86 → 968.08] Dude,
[968.14 → 968.96] that's crazy.
[969.14 → 969.70] Look at this.
[970.24 → 971.00] That's nuts.
[971.00 → 972.44] So you just plumbed
[972.44 → 973.06] the coolant
[973.06 → 974.52] directly up to the...
[974.52 → 975.50] Are you kidding me
[975.50 → 976.04] right now?
[977.16 → 977.64] Actually...
[977.64 → 977.84] Okay.
[980.62 → 981.40] Do you think
[981.40 → 982.28] we could do it?
[983.62 → 984.06] Ourselves?
[984.36 → 984.58] Well,
[984.64 → 985.30] not obviously.
[985.44 → 985.86] We wouldn't have
[985.86 → 987.00] the micro fluid channels.
[987.24 → 987.42] Yeah.
[987.50 → 987.98] But do you think
[987.98 → 989.30] we could seal something
[989.30 → 991.26] against a board
[991.26 → 992.30] well enough
[992.30 → 993.24] to just like
[993.24 → 994.58] pump coolant into it
[994.58 → 995.76] right to the die?
[998.14 → 998.58] Yeah.
[998.94 → 999.48] You think so?
[999.52 → 1000.10] I think so.
[1000.10 → 1001.32] Not anywhere near...
[1001.32 → 1001.62] I mean,
[1001.66 → 1002.36] that was a render,
[1002.52 → 1003.62] but not anywhere near
[1003.62 → 1004.98] as clean as I think
[1004.98 → 1005.86] they're proposing
[1005.86 → 1006.54] that they're going
[1006.54 → 1006.88] to be doing it.
[1006.88 → 1007.04] Like,
[1007.08 → 1007.66] I don't think
[1007.66 → 1008.08] we'd be able
[1008.08 → 1008.36] to do it
[1008.36 → 1009.44] on a desktop socket
[1009.44 → 1010.00] just because
[1010.00 → 1010.42] then you have
[1010.42 → 1010.98] the socket
[1010.98 → 1012.02] to contend with.
[1012.08 → 1012.80] But if we were
[1012.80 → 1013.10] to do it
[1013.10 → 1013.88] on like a framework
[1013.88 → 1014.30] motherboard
[1014.30 → 1015.28] or something like that
[1015.28 → 1016.86] and just basically
[1016.86 → 1017.40] like,
[1017.78 → 1018.16] you know,
[1018.22 → 1019.02] use the cock.
[1020.02 → 1020.92] Just put all the
[1020.92 → 1022.00] cock around the CPU.
[1022.26 → 1022.90] We'll need a lot of
[1022.90 → 1023.16] cock.
[1023.30 → 1023.82] A lot.
[1024.22 → 1024.64] A lot.
[1024.96 → 1025.86] And then just
[1025.86 → 1026.88] plumb it in there.
[1027.28 → 1028.26] Just lay on the cock.
[1028.38 → 1028.60] Yep.
[1029.04 → 1029.76] Just lay on it.
[1029.76 → 1030.24] Yep.
[1031.78 → 1032.40] And then,
[1032.92 → 1033.04] like,
[1033.12 → 1033.98] what kind of shape
[1033.98 → 1034.54] would we need?
[1034.78 → 1035.74] It'd have to be like,
[1035.82 → 1036.66] it couldn't go all
[1036.66 → 1037.34] the way around
[1037.34 → 1038.14] because you'd have
[1038.14 → 1039.00] to have an opening.
[1039.28 → 1039.50] Yeah.
[1039.54 → 1040.02] You'd have to have
[1040.02 → 1040.66] an opening,
[1040.74 → 1041.50] maybe a flat side
[1041.50 → 1042.14] so it'd kind of be,
[1042.44 → 1043.00] it'd be like,
[1043.04 → 1043.86] like the D.
[1044.28 → 1044.50] Somewhere,
[1044.74 → 1045.04] yeah.
[1045.04 → 1045.14] Yeah.
[1045.14 → 1046.04] Yeah.
[1046.76 → 1046.82] Yeah.
[1048.82 → 1049.26] Anyway,
[1049.40 → 1049.82] the point is,
[1049.90 → 1050.48] the reason that I
[1050.48 → 1051.32] wanted to talk about this,
[1051.42 → 1052.16] the reason this is
[1052.16 → 1053.24] like a main topic
[1053.24 → 1054.38] rather than,
[1054.54 → 1054.94] you know,
[1055.00 → 1055.52] like a
[1055.64 → 1056.36] whatever they're called,
[1056.44 → 1057.24] rapid fire topic
[1057.24 → 1058.04] is because
[1058.04 → 1059.72] I saw something
[1059.72 → 1060.66] really cool today
[1060.66 → 1062.12] and I know
[1062.12 → 1062.52] it's not going to
[1062.52 → 1063.10] make you jealous
[1063.10 → 1063.84] because you're going
[1063.84 → 1064.44] somewhere cooler
[1064.44 → 1065.26] than me next week,
[1065.38 → 1065.64] but,
[1066.16 → 1067.82] wait,
[1068.00 → 1068.18] what?
[1068.26 → 1068.40] No,
[1068.46 → 1069.20] I'm excited to hear it.
[1069.40 → 1069.62] Oh,
[1069.70 → 1069.98] okay.
[1070.34 → 1070.76] But,
[1070.90 → 1071.74] it was very cool.
[1071.94 → 1072.16] So,
[1072.38 → 1072.98] our bros
[1072.98 → 1073.54] over at
[1073.54 → 1074.62] Simon Fraser University
[1074.62 → 1075.56] here in
[1075.56 → 1076.84] beautiful British Columbia.
[1077.64 → 1078.42] Last time you worked
[1078.42 → 1078.66] with them,
[1078.70 → 1079.22] it was sick.
[1079.22 → 1081.54] how long ago
[1081.54 → 1081.92] do you think
[1081.92 → 1082.68] that video was?
[1084.60 → 1085.30] Six years.
[1087.44 → 1088.12] It was
[1088.12 → 1089.70] eight years ago.
[1090.88 → 1091.36] Whoa.
[1091.48 → 1092.16] I thought I was
[1092.16 → 1093.50] shooting relatively high.
[1093.50 → 1094.92] That's the face I made.
[1095.10 → 1096.28] Oh my God.
[1096.30 → 1097.66] Because I looked it up
[1097.66 → 1099.08] because I wanted
[1099.08 → 1100.30] to grab a B-roll clip
[1100.30 → 1101.48] from the last time
[1101.48 → 1102.54] as I was writing
[1102.54 → 1102.94] the script
[1102.94 → 1103.64] and I was like,
[1104.10 → 1106.40] you have to be
[1106.40 → 1107.32] kidding me right now.
[1107.48 → 1108.02] That's nuts.
[1108.02 → 1108.32] Yeah,
[1108.42 → 1109.52] the last time
[1109.52 → 1110.10] we worked with them
[1110.10 → 1111.52] was eight years ago
[1111.52 → 1113.18] and at that time
[1113.18 → 1114.12] they were rolling out,
[1114.18 → 1114.78] I believe it's
[1114.78 → 1115.72] codename Cedar,
[1116.20 → 1117.28] Canada's fastest
[1117.28 → 1118.04] supercomputer.
[1118.72 → 1118.86] Well,
[1119.00 → 1119.58] guess what,
[1119.70 → 1119.92] baby?
[1120.06 → 1120.62] This time,
[1121.04 → 1122.42] things are getting furry
[1122.42 → 1124.24] if you know what I'm saying.
[1124.52 → 1124.90] Beaver?
[1125.24 → 1125.82] Codename Fur.
[1126.18 → 1126.44] Oh.
[1126.66 → 1126.82] Yeah.
[1127.22 → 1127.46] Nice.
[1127.50 → 1128.22] They're named after trees.
[1128.36 → 1128.54] Cool.
[1128.66 → 1128.80] Yeah.
[1129.04 → 1129.36] So,
[1129.54 → 1130.58] this time around,
[1130.92 → 1132.96] they just rolled out
[1132.96 → 1133.86] their fur
[1133.86 → 1135.76] super computing cluster
[1135.76 → 1137.18] and it makes
[1137.18 → 1137.86] Cedar
[1137.86 → 1138.66] look like
[1138.66 → 1140.12] it's made of wood.
[1140.64 → 1140.66] Like,
[1140.84 → 1140.98] it's,
[1141.32 → 1141.50] dude,
[1141.62 → 1142.62] Cedar is like
[1142.62 → 1143.74] hobo garbage
[1143.74 → 1144.88] compared to fur.
[1145.08 → 1146.54] It's amazing.
[1147.70 → 1148.88] Have you already seen it?
[1148.94 → 1149.76] I was there this week.
[1149.76 → 1149.82] Oh,
[1149.92 → 1150.12] nice.
[1150.22 → 1150.36] Okay.
[1150.42 → 1150.56] Yeah,
[1150.66 → 1150.86] so,
[1151.04 → 1151.28] so,
[1151.42 → 1152.42] the reason that
[1152.42 → 1153.84] I felt it was related
[1153.84 → 1154.34] to this
[1154.34 → 1154.90] is that
[1154.90 → 1156.36] we haven't actually
[1156.36 → 1157.70] gotten many opportunities
[1157.70 → 1159.18] to look at liquid
[1159.18 → 1160.30] cooling in the data centre.
[1160.30 → 1161.04] so,
[1161.04 → 1161.90] we did that thing
[1161.90 → 1162.78] with Equinix
[1162.78 → 1163.90] a little while back,
[1164.08 → 1164.24] but,
[1164.36 → 1165.20] and they had some
[1165.20 → 1166.20] liquid cooled racks,
[1166.40 → 1168.00] but they were inside
[1168.00 → 1169.28] a cage that belonged
[1169.28 → 1169.96] to a customer
[1169.96 → 1170.58] because that's
[1170.58 → 1171.76] Equinix's business,
[1171.88 → 1172.08] right?
[1172.20 → 1172.82] I got to see it
[1172.82 → 1173.52] at OVH.
[1173.88 → 1174.24] Well,
[1174.26 → 1174.84] I didn't go there.
[1174.86 → 1175.62] We couldn't look at
[1175.62 → 1176.64] certain things too closely
[1176.64 → 1177.10] and stuff.
[1177.24 → 1177.90] I got to look at
[1177.90 → 1178.40] everything.
[1178.60 → 1178.80] Oh.
[1178.80 → 1179.40] So,
[1179.60 → 1180.82] because SFU
[1180.82 → 1181.72] are the actual
[1181.72 → 1183.40] owners of the systems,
[1183.62 → 1184.36] they were like,
[1184.86 → 1185.06] yeah,
[1185.22 → 1185.58] fuck it.
[1185.88 → 1186.52] We're going to pull
[1186.52 → 1187.48] a couple out of prod
[1187.48 → 1188.48] and so,
[1188.74 → 1190.20] both a CPU node
[1190.20 → 1191.62] and a GPU node,
[1191.92 → 1192.94] we got a chance
[1192.94 → 1195.02] to go right hands-on
[1195.02 → 1197.46] with direct-to-die
[1197.46 → 1198.70] cooling systems.
[1199.24 → 1200.36] We saw the
[1200.36 → 1201.76] we saw the liquid
[1201.76 → 1202.90] distribution units
[1202.90 → 1203.58] that go down
[1203.58 → 1204.30] at the end of the
[1204.34 → 1205.32] at the end of the aisle.
[1206.06 → 1206.62] We,
[1207.18 → 1207.40] like,
[1207.46 → 1207.80] got to,
[1208.00 → 1208.78] oh my God,
[1208.80 → 1209.56] they're beautiful.
[1210.58 → 1210.88] So,
[1211.04 → 1211.20] so,
[1211.30 → 1211.56] man,
[1211.90 → 1212.12] they're,
[1212.28 → 1212.46] okay,
[1212.74 → 1213.04] so,
[1213.40 → 1214.40] they had CPU nodes
[1214.40 → 1215.12] and GPU nodes
[1215.12 → 1215.98] as part of the cluster
[1215.98 → 1217.38] and the CPU nodes
[1217.38 → 1218.30] are 1U,
[1219.24 → 1219.44] okay,
[1219.66 → 1221.44] 192 cores.
[1222.90 → 1223.42] Yeah.
[1224.58 → 1225.06] Oh,
[1225.06 → 1225.26] wait,
[1225.40 → 1225.72] hold on.
[1225.76 → 1227.06] Did I say 192 cores?
[1227.16 → 1227.30] No,
[1227.36 → 1227.48] no,
[1227.52 → 1227.94] that's wrong.
[1228.02 → 1228.22] Sorry.
[1228.60 → 1229.28] 1U,
[1229.58 → 1230.72] two nodes per U,
[1231.14 → 1232.96] 192 cores per node.
[1233.18 → 1233.56] Jeez.
[1233.80 → 1234.12] So,
[1234.30 → 1235.40] so these are almost
[1235.40 → 1237.62] 400 cores
[1237.62 → 1239.32] per 1U
[1239.32 → 1240.84] and there isn't
[1240.84 → 1242.52] a single fan in them.
[1243.28 → 1244.40] Not one.
[1244.86 → 1245.88] It's just all water cooled?
[1246.04 → 1247.62] The CPUs are liquid cooled.
[1248.62 → 1249.68] The memory
[1249.68 → 1250.98] is liquid cooled.
[1252.08 → 1253.18] The NIC
[1253.18 → 1254.28] is liquid cooled.
[1254.82 → 1256.30] The SSD bay
[1256.30 → 1258.28] is freaking liquid cooled.
[1258.52 → 1259.64] Everything is liquid cooled.
[1259.80 → 1260.08] And then,
[1260.28 → 1260.92] the GPU,
[1261.36 → 1262.12] the GPU one,
[1262.12 → 1262.98] obviously,
[1263.42 → 1264.90] adds the GPUs to that.
[1265.22 → 1265.52] So,
[1265.58 → 1266.66] they're using chilled liquid
[1266.66 → 1268.20] from the outside
[1268.20 → 1268.80] of the building.
[1268.90 → 1269.48] They've got
[1269.48 → 1271.42] evaporative cooling towers.
[1271.70 → 1272.04] So,
[1272.10 → 1273.12] they pull those in.
[1273.42 → 1274.12] Those go
[1274.12 → 1275.36] to their water doors.
[1275.78 → 1276.00] So,
[1276.10 → 1276.70] they have the same
[1276.70 → 1277.24] rear doors
[1277.24 → 1278.04] that they had last time.
[1278.10 → 1278.78] Did you watch the video
[1278.78 → 1279.22] last time?
[1279.30 → 1279.40] Yes.
[1279.40 → 1279.42] I mean,
[1279.42 → 1280.16] it was eight years ago.
[1280.26 → 1281.00] I wouldn't blame you for forgetting.
[1281.06 → 1281.08] I mean,
[1281.10 → 1281.94] I don't remember,
[1282.04 → 1282.40] but yes.
[1282.50 → 1283.08] But basically,
[1283.38 → 1284.58] you pull ambient air
[1284.58 → 1285.52] in the front of the rack.
[1285.84 → 1287.42] It gets superheated,
[1287.66 → 1288.02] essentially.
[1288.16 → 1288.26] Well,
[1288.26 → 1289.06] not superheated
[1289.06 → 1290.22] in like a scientific sense,
[1290.22 → 1291.38] but it gets heated up,
[1291.42 → 1291.58] okay?
[1291.92 → 1292.22] And then,
[1292.26 → 1293.08] it comes out the back
[1293.08 → 1293.84] and then,
[1293.96 → 1294.36] they have,
[1294.58 → 1295.88] they force the hot air
[1295.88 → 1297.10] through a door
[1297.10 → 1298.46] that is a big radiator
[1298.46 → 1299.96] that has chilled liquid
[1299.96 → 1300.52] running through it,
[1300.54 → 1301.82] about 16 degrees Celsius.
[1302.10 → 1302.20] Yeah.
[1302.28 → 1302.60] And then,
[1302.64 → 1303.78] by the time it gets crapped out
[1303.78 → 1304.46] into the aisle,
[1304.92 → 1306.00] it's just room temperature.
[1306.12 → 1306.22] So,
[1306.26 → 1307.42] they don't have a traditional
[1307.42 → 1308.20] hot aisle,
[1308.34 → 1309.32] cold aisle setup.
[1309.60 → 1309.68] Yeah.
[1309.86 → 1310.56] They just have
[1310.56 → 1312.02] hot inside the rack
[1312.02 → 1313.48] and then two cold aisles,
[1313.56 → 1313.92] essentially.
[1314.42 → 1315.20] A decent amount of this
[1315.20 → 1315.84] sounds pretty similar
[1315.84 → 1316.80] to OVH's setup.
[1316.88 → 1316.98] So,
[1317.06 → 1318.14] they still have water doors
[1318.14 → 1318.84] on the back
[1318.84 → 1319.66] and that just handles
[1319.66 → 1320.90] any waste heat
[1320.90 → 1321.92] from the power supply,
[1322.36 → 1323.20] any networking
[1323.20 → 1324.32] that's inside the cabinet,
[1324.56 → 1325.40] anything like that.
[1325.50 → 1325.88] So,
[1325.94 → 1327.34] they pump the primary loop
[1327.34 → 1328.44] right into those water doors.
[1328.54 → 1328.64] So,
[1328.68 → 1329.56] that's the glycol loop
[1329.56 → 1330.02] that goes out
[1330.02 → 1330.80] to the cooling towers.
[1331.20 → 1331.42] Then,
[1331.50 → 1332.94] they go from the water doors
[1332.94 → 1336.12] to the cooling distribution units
[1336.12 → 1337.48] that are liquid distribution,
[1337.60 → 1338.02] Aldus,
[1338.08 → 1338.76] whatever they're called.
[1338.90 → 1339.56] It's in the video.
[1339.84 → 1340.02] So,
[1340.08 → 1341.10] those are at the end of the aisle
[1341.10 → 1341.68] and then,
[1341.72 → 1343.30] they've got a huge
[1343.30 → 1344.68] heat exchanger in those.
[1344.84 → 1345.50] And when I say huge,
[1345.56 → 1345.86] I mean
[1345.86 → 1347.18] f***ING massive.
[1347.18 → 1351.18] 600 kilowatts.
[1352.70 → 1354.52] 600,000 watts
[1354.52 → 1355.94] heat exchangers
[1355.94 → 1357.20] in these things.
[1358.16 → 1358.98] It's enough to,
[1359.06 → 1360.30] it's enough to make a man
[1360.30 → 1361.26] all hot and bothered.
[1362.16 → 1362.80] And then,
[1362.90 → 1363.44] so those
[1363.44 → 1364.86] have redundant pumps.
[1365.20 → 1365.62] What's that,
[1365.70 → 1366.60] Mr. Daniel Lesser?
[1366.74 → 1367.10] Sorry about that.
[1367.10 → 1367.62] I need a minute.
[1367.78 → 1368.96] 600,000 watts.
[1368.96 → 1369.10] Yeah,
[1369.18 → 1369.50] I know,
[1369.62 → 1369.90] right?
[1369.98 → 1370.76] How big are they?
[1370.86 → 1371.58] They're not that big.
[1371.84 → 1372.06] No?
[1372.22 → 1372.42] No,
[1372.42 → 1373.12] they're not that big.
[1373.12 → 1374.20] Is that like the size of a building
[1374.20 → 1375.02] or like a room?
[1375.16 → 1375.36] No,
[1375.48 → 1375.66] no,
[1375.72 → 1376.78] they're just at the end of the rack.
[1376.86 → 1377.76] They look like a regular,
[1377.94 → 1378.54] How is that possible?
[1378.62 → 1379.42] a regular cabinet.
[1380.04 → 1381.42] It's just a big heat exchanger,
[1381.48 → 1381.62] man.
[1381.70 → 1381.94] I mean,
[1382.18 → 1383.00] that one in my,
[1383.06 → 1383.80] in my basement.
[1383.98 → 1384.12] Yeah.
[1384.30 → 1385.40] It's only like this big.
[1385.48 → 1385.82] I forget,
[1385.88 → 1386.96] I forget how many freaking watts
[1386.96 → 1387.46] that thing does,
[1387.50 → 1388.38] but it's a lot.
[1388.86 → 1388.96] Like,
[1389.48 → 1389.70] I,
[1389.70 → 1389.90] I,
[1389.90 → 1390.84] The exchanger's pretty nuts.
[1390.92 → 1391.10] Yeah.
[1391.22 → 1391.46] Crazy.
[1391.70 → 1392.70] Fluid to fluid heat exchange,
[1392.76 → 1392.86] man.
[1392.86 → 1393.48] It's efficient,
[1393.80 → 1394.22] right?
[1394.68 → 1394.96] Anyway,
[1395.38 → 1396.06] so,
[1396.18 → 1398.70] 600,000 watt heat exchanger
[1398.70 → 1400.42] and then they've got redundant pumps
[1400.42 → 1400.86] in there
[1400.86 → 1403.04] and those pump the secondary loop
[1403.04 → 1405.44] which goes directly to the system.
[1405.54 → 1405.62] So,
[1405.68 → 1406.46] you don't need glycol
[1406.46 → 1407.46] because it's all indoors.
[1408.06 → 1409.24] You don't actually go outside
[1409.24 → 1410.12] to the cooling towers.
[1410.34 → 1410.62] Okay.
[1410.74 → 1411.18] So,
[1411.26 → 1412.04] that is different then.
[1412.52 → 1412.70] Oh,
[1412.74 → 1412.94] okay.
[1412.98 → 1413.58] Is that different?
[1413.68 → 1414.28] I believe so.
[1414.56 → 1414.84] Okay.
[1415.84 → 1417.78] If I'm remembering everything correctly.
[1417.94 → 1419.86] Most setups would have a primary
[1419.86 → 1420.64] and a secondary loop
[1420.64 → 1422.00] and they would use heat exchangers,
[1422.52 → 1422.86] but,
[1423.42 → 1423.64] you know,
[1423.64 → 1424.38] maybe they do.
[1424.38 → 1424.44] No,
[1424.44 → 1424.50] I mean,
[1424.62 → 1426.44] I think OVAs all go outside.
[1426.84 → 1427.22] Do they?
[1427.34 → 1427.80] I think so.
[1427.82 → 1427.92] So,
[1428.04 → 1428.72] just primary loop.
[1428.94 → 1429.48] I believe so.
[1429.52 → 1430.18] No secondary loop.
[1430.32 → 1430.50] Okay.
[1430.98 → 1431.78] Don't quote us.
[1431.88 → 1433.10] That might not be true
[1433.10 → 1433.92] of every data centre.
[1434.02 → 1435.44] I also just might not remember correctly.
[1435.52 → 1436.38] That they've done necessarily.
[1437.56 → 1437.96] Okay.
[1438.02 → 1438.14] So,
[1438.24 → 1439.72] what was I talking about next?
[1439.80 → 1439.94] Oh,
[1440.00 → 1440.24] yes.
[1440.38 → 1440.58] Oh,
[1440.58 → 1440.80] dude,
[1440.88 → 1441.48] like it's crazy.
[1441.82 → 1441.94] So,
[1442.00 → 1443.48] I was actually able to like,
[1443.88 → 1445.40] because they're SFU systems.
[1446.04 → 1447.84] There are no concerns about customer security
[1447.84 → 1448.70] or privacy or whatever.
[1448.96 → 1449.12] So,
[1449.22 → 1450.82] we were freaking opening up
[1450.82 → 1452.06] like the heat exchanger cabinet.
[1452.06 → 1452.40] I'm like,
[1452.56 → 1452.70] oh,
[1452.76 → 1453.96] I wonder which side is the hot side.
[1454.02 → 1455.14] Put my freaking hands on them.
[1455.30 → 1455.38] Like,
[1455.68 → 1456.00] dude,
[1456.08 → 1456.54] it's crazy.
[1456.82 → 1456.98] So,
[1457.04 → 1458.74] the hot side is like almost 40 degrees
[1458.74 → 1459.64] or something like that.
[1459.64 → 1460.40] And so,
[1460.46 → 1461.64] that goes into the heat exchanger
[1461.64 → 1462.38] and then that goes to,
[1462.46 → 1464.34] I think the coolant coming out of the water doors
[1464.34 → 1464.70] is like,
[1464.78 → 1466.28] it starts at 16 and a half.
[1466.34 → 1468.36] It goes up to like 18 or 20 or something like that.
[1468.58 → 1468.82] Dude,
[1468.92 → 1469.74] and the side of these,
[1469.74 → 1471.12] these liquid distribution units,
[1471.12 → 1473.18] they have like a touchscreen LCD on them
[1473.18 → 1474.70] that just shows like both loops
[1474.70 → 1475.42] and all the temperatures
[1475.42 → 1476.72] and pump RPMs and everything.
[1476.82 → 1477.82] They've got all the telemetry.
[1478.08 → 1478.26] Ah,
[1478.86 → 1479.32] ah,
[1480.22 → 1482.88] if only I had 82 million Canadian dollars,
[1483.00 → 1485.74] then I too could have that.
[1485.94 → 1486.44] I wonder,
[1486.44 → 1487.48] also I'd have to have somewhere to put it.
[1487.70 → 1491.70] I know a lot of schools actually do have quite a bit of money,
[1491.86 → 1493.14] but I wonder like,
[1494.02 → 1496.70] that's a lot of money for like student project stuff.
[1497.12 → 1497.18] So,
[1497.26 → 1497.94] I wonder what they're doing with it.
[1497.94 → 1499.08] Like student projects.
[1499.44 → 1499.74] Research stuff,
[1499.88 → 1500.58] PhD students.
[1500.60 → 1501.30] This is research.
[1501.50 → 1504.50] I would imagine they might even lease out some of this compute.
[1504.86 → 1506.84] I don't actually know that for sure,
[1507.28 → 1510.72] but I do know that the funding came from a combination
[1510.72 → 1512.24] of the federal government,
[1512.48 → 1513.26] the provincial government,
[1513.26 → 1518.60] and then also in-kind discounts from the providers.
[1519.04 → 1519.16] So,
[1519.28 → 1520.34] they mentioned Lenovo.
[1520.78 → 1521.16] Shoot,
[1521.22 → 1522.30] I'm going to forget who they are.
[1522.40 → 1525.60] They also mentioned the brand that did the cooling
[1525.60 → 1526.50] and one other brand,
[1526.60 → 1527.18] but they all get,
[1527.18 → 1529.06] they're all shouted out at the end of the video.
[1529.58 → 1532.42] It was an absolutely incredible tour though.
[1532.52 → 1536.52] It was my first time getting to go full nuts and bolts,
[1536.94 → 1537.42] hands on.
[1537.48 → 1538.32] That's really cool.
[1538.62 → 1539.14] And like,
[1539.20 → 1539.78] I got to say,
[1539.86 → 1540.02] man,
[1540.30 → 1544.44] the loop layouts in these things are like wild.
[1545.02 → 1545.22] Like,
[1545.62 → 1552.32] completely defy every law of efficient water cooling loop layout logic.
[1552.42 → 1552.82] What do you mean?
[1552.94 → 1553.26] How so?
[1553.26 → 1553.60] Like,
[1553.60 → 1555.96] they are full of 90 degree bends.
[1556.38 → 1556.64] Oh.
[1556.74 → 1557.32] They're everywhere.
[1558.36 → 1559.12] And like,
[1559.18 → 1559.50] they've got,
[1559.66 → 1562.18] they're using these like teeny tiny,
[1562.18 → 1564.86] like one eighth inch tubes inside.
[1565.18 → 1567.10] There's like manifolds everywhere.
[1567.66 → 1571.40] The whole thing doesn't look particularly balanced for flow restriction.
[1571.40 → 1574.36] Do they just have like insane pressure and don't care?
[1574.36 → 1574.64] Like,
[1574.74 → 1575.26] um,
[1576.32 → 1577.92] so they're taking a one eighth inch.
[1578.02 → 1579.56] It looks like a one eighth inch tube.
[1579.64 → 1580.52] Maybe it's quarter inch.
[1580.58 → 1581.66] I don't know how thick the walls are.
[1581.66 → 1582.68] Because it's all copper.
[1582.84 → 1583.04] Huh?
[1583.10 → 1583.92] It's copper everywhere.
[1583.92 → 1584.56] It's beautiful.
[1584.56 → 1586.18] And they take that one,
[1586.26 → 1587.48] like one eighth inch,
[1587.58 → 1589.06] maybe one quarter inch tube.
[1589.14 → 1591.74] And it goes to a manifold that goes to those four GPUs,
[1591.78 → 1594.08] each of which is 700 Watts.
[1594.96 → 1595.18] Oh,
[1595.26 → 1597.38] did I even mention the GPU nodes are one.
[1597.52 → 1599.56] You have 48 CPU cores.
[1599.62 → 1601.52] They can actually do tool dual CPUs.
[1601.58 → 1601.82] They could,
[1601.86 → 1607.34] you could put 192 cores in there, and then they have four H one hundred in each one.
[1607.34 → 1608.98] You not a single fan,
[1609.06 → 1610.38] not one.
[1610.48 → 1611.38] How much is an H 100?
[1611.82 → 1613.02] Don't worry about it.
[1613.66 → 1614.68] About 30 grand.
[1615.32 → 1616.18] I thought it was H 200.
[1616.90 → 1617.30] Uh,
[1617.40 → 1619.36] I don't think they're priced that differently.
[1619.54 → 1619.70] Oh,
[1620.30 → 1622.06] and these are H 100 80 gigs,
[1622.20 → 1624.62] which are like the better H 100.
[1624.78 → 1627.86] And then the H 200 has even more memory if I recall correctly,
[1627.88 → 1629.44] but uses the same hopper architecture.
[1630.82 → 1631.30] Yeah.
[1631.68 → 1632.92] Some of these are real expensive.
[1633.54 → 1633.82] Uh,
[1634.00 → 1634.20] yeah.
[1634.98 → 1637.96] See 40 K for one of them,
[1638.00 → 1638.76] but it's from a reseller.
[1638.84 → 1639.24] So I have no,
[1639.36 → 1640.36] I have no idea what people are actually doing.
[1640.38 → 1641.22] Yeah.
[1641.34 → 1642.24] And you know,
[1642.24 → 1646.72] that completely ignores any in-kind discounts that you get as an educational institution or whatever.
[1647.02 → 1648.90] SFU wasn't able to tell me what they paid for them.
[1648.98 → 1650.34] So we just kind of used,
[1650.38 → 1651.08] sure.
[1651.22 → 1651.50] You know,
[1651.58 → 1654.02] word on the street stuff pricing for them.
[1654.06 → 1654.26] Yep.
[1656.32 → 1660.18] They did say the total budget though was 82 million Canadian dollars.
[1660.38 → 1661.20] So that's,
[1661.20 → 1661.46] uh,
[1661.46 → 1662.88] basically all the money in Canada.
[1663.00 → 1663.34] So did they,
[1663.44 → 1664.70] did they,
[1664.80 → 1666.12] did they decommission Cedar?
[1666.68 → 1667.08] Yeah.
[1667.08 → 1667.46] They hit,
[1667.52 → 1668.12] they actually,
[1668.34 → 1671.66] I couldn't quite tell if they were joking or not.
[1671.66 → 1672.16] So I said,
[1672.22 → 1672.34] no,
[1672.38 → 1672.62] thanks.
[1672.62 → 1673.04] I'm good.
[1673.10 → 1674.72] But they offered to just like,
[1675.60 → 1676.90] hand me a node.
[1676.90 → 1677.82] And like,
[1678.02 → 1678.26] you know,
[1678.28 → 1678.66] they were like,
[1678.70 → 1679.62] need any SSDs?
[1679.68 → 1679.78] Her,
[1679.78 → 1680.00] her,
[1680.00 → 1680.16] her.
[1681.34 → 1682.60] I'm pretty sure they were kidding,
[1682.74 → 1684.30] but I didn't want to get anybody in trouble.
[1684.46 → 1684.90] So I just,
[1684.90 → 1689.46] I just said no and laughed along, and we didn't take anything out and they,
[1689.74 → 1690.82] nothing left their facility.
[1691.00 → 1691.56] Everything's good.
[1691.76 → 1692.36] Everything's chill.
[1692.36 → 1693.16] But I'm,
[1693.16 → 1694.32] I'm pretty sure they were joking,
[1694.48 → 1694.92] but no,
[1694.98 → 1696.58] it was just pieces of Cedar.
[1696.58 → 1697.80] We're just sitting on racks.
[1698.42 → 1698.78] Just,
[1699.08 → 1699.96] I mean,
[1699.96 → 1700.68] it was eight years ago.
[1700.76 → 1702.34] What are they going to do with it?
[1702.62 → 1702.76] No.
[1702.94 → 1704.84] Who's going to want an eight-year-old supercomputer?
[1705.08 → 1705.24] I mean,
[1705.26 → 1706.56] we talked about this on WAN show.
[1706.66 → 1710.50] Remember when that like used to be a top 10 supercomputer or whatever it was,
[1710.52 → 1711.62] was for sale on eBay.
[1712.48 → 1713.16] You remember that,
[1713.20 → 1713.30] right?
[1713.44 → 1713.56] Yeah.
[1713.66 → 1713.78] Yeah.
[1713.86 → 1714.36] And we,
[1714.38 → 1717.12] we basically had so many people linked it to me, and we're like,
[1717.16 → 1717.44] Linus,
[1717.46 → 1718.34] you should buy a supercomputer.
[1718.62 → 1719.32] And it's like,
[1719.54 → 1722.34] not necessarily because,
[1722.36 → 1727.08] while the processors and maybe the memory might have some value,
[1727.46 → 1732.06] those platforms are basically garbage because they cost more to run than
[1732.06 → 1733.14] they're worth to run,
[1733.32 → 1737.34] which is why they're being decommissioned because the new stuff is so much
[1737.34 → 1741.12] more efficient that by the time you spend all that money on power,
[1741.62 → 1746.58] you're way better off just buying new stuff and powering that instead of
[1746.58 → 1747.48] running the older stuff.
[1749.94 → 1750.46] Yeah.
[1750.56 → 1750.88] Was it,
[1750.92 → 1751.82] was it Cheyenne?
[1752.36 → 1752.72] Was that,
[1752.76 → 1753.98] was that the one that was for sale?
[1754.42 → 1755.02] I forget.
[1755.10 → 1755.30] It was,
[1755.36 → 1756.00] it was one of the
[1756.02 → 1756.20] it was,
[1756.30 → 1756.36] well,
[1756.38 → 1757.46] it was a major supercomputer.
[1759.04 → 1760.86] That might be the one.
[1761.18 → 1761.40] Yeah,
[1761.50 → 1761.72] yeah,
[1761.72 → 1761.96] yeah,
[1761.96 → 1762.22] yeah,
[1762.22 → 1762.50] yeah,
[1762.50 → 1762.80] yeah,
[1762.80 → 1762.98] yeah,
[1762.98 → 1763.12] yeah,
[1763.12 → 1763.22] yeah.
[1766.00 → 1768.58] Cheyenne supercomputer sold at auction for half a million dollars.
[1768.76 → 1769.04] So,
[1769.12 → 1769.30] I mean,
[1769.32 → 1770.76] when this thing would have been purchased,
[1770.86 → 1772.30] it would have been a flipping fortune.
[1772.30 → 1772.76] This is,
[1772.86 → 1775.56] this is loading too slow, and I'm actually not that invested in it anymore.
[1775.88 → 1776.98] What are we supposed to be doing next,
[1777.08 → 1777.18] Dan?
[1777.90 → 1778.64] You're a little early,
[1778.74 → 1780.10] so you can keep doing more topics if you want.
[1780.10 → 1780.94] Uh,
[1780.94 → 1782.66] we don't have like a ton of topics this week,
[1782.68 → 1783.36] so why don't we just,
[1783.56 → 1785.04] let's go into merch messages then.
[1785.38 → 1786.00] All right.
[1786.08 → 1788.44] Those of you who are new to the WAN show,
[1788.56 → 1789.64] we don't do super chats,
[1789.70 → 1790.88] we don't do Twitch bits,
[1790.94 → 1792.08] we do merch messages.
[1792.08 → 1793.16] Cause the way we see it,
[1793.24 → 1795.02] when you throw your money at the screen,
[1795.22 → 1798.24] you should get something thrown right back in your face.
[1798.24 → 1799.42] In this case,
[1799.58 → 1803.34] high quality merchandise from LTT store.com.
[1803.98 → 1805.56] Where are my call-outs?
[1805.66 → 1806.68] I don't see them.
[1807.12 → 1807.90] CW announcements.
[1808.14 → 1808.76] There they are.
[1808.88 → 1809.28] Oh,
[1809.62 → 1813.28] we have some very exciting things for you folks.
[1813.50 → 1813.74] Luke,
[1813.78 → 1814.88] would you like to model it?
[1815.40 → 1815.62] Oh,
[1815.70 → 1816.02] yes.
[1816.10 → 1817.24] We have more tall shirts.
[1817.76 → 1818.12] Woo.
[1818.26 → 1818.62] I don't know.
[1818.74 → 1819.42] I can stand,
[1819.52 → 1820.40] but I'm going to go right out of frame.
[1820.52 → 1821.02] Now you can,
[1821.14 → 1821.48] look,
[1821.84 → 1822.28] it fits.
[1822.58 → 1824.98] Now you can have a tall shirt in any colour you want,
[1825.08 → 1828.06] as long as it's black or one of our new colours.
[1828.06 → 1829.00] My hands are above my head.
[1829.08 → 1829.38] My shirt,
[1829.48 → 1830.18] my belly's not showing.
[1830.38 → 1830.74] Wow.
[1831.32 → 1831.82] Gotta love it.
[1831.82 → 1832.40] It's amazing.
[1832.56 → 1833.70] They're not just black shirts.
[1833.88 → 1834.60] I know.
[1834.64 → 1835.66] It's kind of a curse for me,
[1835.70 → 1837.08] cause now I need to buy a bunch more shirts.
[1837.42 → 1840.36] Do you want to load up LTT store while I talk through the new stuff that's there?
[1840.38 → 1840.56] It is up.
[1840.62 → 1841.04] I'm done.
[1841.32 → 1847.20] We have a new fall colours drop in both long sleeve and short sleeve,
[1847.36 → 1851.24] and they are available in both regular and tall fit.
[1851.50 → 1854.26] The lineup now includes stone.
[1855.28 → 1855.90] That's all of,
[1856.02 → 1856.42] uh,
[1856.56 → 1856.98] uh,
[1856.98 → 1857.60] you'll find it.
[1857.68 → 1858.04] There it is.
[1858.78 → 1859.26] Stone.
[1860.62 → 1861.06] Shadow.
[1862.84 → 1864.36] And cranberry,
[1864.98 → 1866.22] which is what Luke's wearing.
[1866.36 → 1870.00] So we can help you keep your wardrobe fresh this fall.
[1870.08 → 1872.72] Our blank shirts are extremely well reviewed.
[1873.20 → 1873.40] Uh,
[1873.40 → 1875.92] we've got 303 reviews on the site now,
[1876.00 → 1876.36] by the way,
[1876.40 → 1877.88] if you ever buy something on LTT store,
[1877.98 → 1879.66] please do leave a review.
[1879.78 → 1881.10] We always want your feedback,
[1881.32 → 1884.66] no matter whether it's super positive or super negative,
[1884.66 → 1885.90] as long as you're keeping it,
[1886.26 → 1886.56] you know,
[1886.56 → 1887.76] factual and,
[1887.76 → 1888.22] and,
[1888.22 → 1890.00] and your criticisms are constructive.
[1890.00 → 1892.02] We always want to build better products.
[1892.02 → 1894.22] So please tell us your experience,
[1894.22 → 1894.52] uh,
[1894.52 → 1897.98] because that also helps people who are shopping for the products.
[1897.98 → 1899.80] And there's more.
[1899.80 → 1904.46] The defray sale is wrapping up and stock is almost gone.
[1904.60 → 1905.96] We've got crazy pricing.
[1906.04 → 1906.70] Do you want to pull it up?
[1906.70 → 1908.44] On the hot dog V-neck,
[1908.94 → 1911.22] the maze screensaver party shirt.
[1912.18 → 1913.20] He's looking for it.
[1913.26 → 1913.94] He's going to find it.
[1914.02 → 1914.36] I missed click.
[1914.48 → 1915.22] I meant to click the arrow.
[1915.30 → 1915.86] He's got this.
[1915.98 → 1916.64] There we go.
[1918.00 → 1918.92] The blank,
[1919.22 → 1919.46] or the
[1919.58 → 1919.82] excuse me,
[1919.86 → 1920.14] the blank,
[1920.36 → 1923.58] the black task jacket and dropout hoodies.
[1923.84 → 1924.88] Once they're gone,
[1925.14 → 1925.98] they're gone.
[1926.20 → 1926.64] Uh,
[1926.72 → 1927.52] friendly reminder,
[1927.98 → 1929.74] wish I had mentioned this last week.
[1930.22 → 1930.70] Um,
[1931.00 → 1934.14] try to bundle these with something else because,
[1934.86 → 1935.40] um,
[1935.84 → 1937.96] as you can probably tell,
[1938.10 → 1938.48] no,
[1938.56 → 1942.12] we are not making money on these at these kinds of discounts.
[1942.62 → 1944.66] So that would be super cool.
[1945.30 → 1945.82] Neat.
[1946.38 → 1946.66] Um,
[1946.66 → 1947.96] there's also like,
[1947.96 → 1948.42] uh,
[1948.54 → 1950.72] some of these don't have any stock left.
[1950.78 → 1952.30] Like I think the CPU pillow is gone.
[1952.56 → 1952.98] Oh yeah.
[1953.26 → 1953.50] Yep.
[1954.10 → 1954.34] Yeah.
[1954.46 → 1957.48] But that does not mean that they're all out of stock.
[1957.58 → 1959.38] Some of them might have just one size.
[1959.38 → 1960.64] Like he mentioned the task jacket.
[1960.72 → 1961.66] That one just has a medium.
[1961.90 → 1962.02] Yeah.
[1962.18 → 1962.42] Uh,
[1962.42 → 1963.58] but the discounts are pretty nuts.
[1963.66 → 1966.08] So it's decently worth checking through here.
[1966.16 → 1967.16] Seeing what ones are still around.
[1967.46 → 1967.76] All right.
[1968.02 → 1968.50] Uh,
[1969.00 → 1969.82] what else we got?
[1969.98 → 1970.72] And finally,
[1971.24 → 1972.96] behind the seams feature.
[1973.26 → 1979.62] We put out a behind the seams' newsletter where we break down the design process that went into making our blank tees the way we wanted.
[1980.10 → 1980.46] Fit,
[1980.76 → 1981.16] fabric,
[1981.52 → 1981.96] durability,
[1982.32 → 1983.22] all of it.
[1983.32 → 1984.32] Where will I find that?
[1984.54 → 1986.20] If you're into that kind of behind the scenes,
[1986.30 → 1987.68] look at how our products come together.
[1988.06 → 1989.36] Sign up for the newsletter to catch up.
[1989.36 → 1990.22] Catch future deep dives.
[1990.32 → 1990.46] Oh,
[1990.54 → 1990.74] okay.
[1991.10 → 1991.38] All right.
[1991.44 → 1991.60] Yeah.
[1991.72 → 1992.06] Uh,
[1992.06 → 1992.76] sign up for the newsletter.
[1992.88 → 1993.42] Where is that?
[1993.48 → 1993.60] Oh,
[1993.66 → 1994.08] there it is.
[1994.84 → 1995.16] Nice.
[1996.38 → 1996.70] Cool.
[1998.50 → 1998.92] All right.
[1998.96 → 1999.54] You want to pick a topic?
[2000.26 → 2001.52] We've got to read a couple of merch messages.
[2001.52 → 2001.60] Oh,
[2001.62 → 2001.76] right.
[2001.80 → 2002.30] Merch messages.
[2002.46 → 2002.60] Sorry.
[2002.70 → 2002.82] Sorry.
[2002.92 → 2003.10] Oh,
[2003.14 → 2003.32] right.
[2003.36 → 2004.90] We never explained how to send a merch message.
[2005.14 → 2007.16] All you got to do is go to LTT store.com.
[2007.58 → 2007.86] Oh,
[2008.14 → 2008.62] there we go.
[2009.10 → 2010.20] Add something to your cart.
[2010.30 → 2010.44] Say,
[2010.48 → 2010.90] for example,
[2011.06 → 2013.96] a tall fit t-shirt in cranberry.
[2014.04 → 2014.14] Hey,
[2014.14 → 2014.60] look at that.
[2014.96 → 2016.14] Then you can look just like Luke.
[2017.14 → 2017.68] And Jake Bell.
[2018.08 → 2018.90] Jake Bell's not tall.
[2019.00 → 2019.78] Why did he model these?
[2019.96 → 2020.18] Okay.
[2020.28 → 2020.58] You know what?
[2020.60 → 2021.08] It doesn't matter.
[2021.18 → 2021.74] The point is,
[2022.24 → 2022.62] uh,
[2022.62 → 2023.16] we are live.
[2023.22 → 2023.78] So you just click,
[2023.94 → 2026.68] I would like my purchase to appear as a merch message on the LTT stream.
[2026.68 → 2029.60] You just send your merch message, and it'll go to producer Dan.
[2031.94 → 2032.34] Uh,
[2032.72 → 2033.02] okay.
[2033.20 → 2034.12] I'm wearing a shirt.
[2034.14 → 2034.56] Get out of here.
[2034.64 → 2034.96] Get out of here.
[2034.96 → 2035.38] There we go.
[2035.68 → 2040.10] It'll go to producer Dan who will put it down there or who will reply to it or,
[2040.24 → 2040.50] oh yeah,
[2040.58 → 2040.74] sorry.
[2040.84 → 2040.98] Right.
[2041.10 → 2041.22] Oh,
[2041.30 → 2042.02] not he hit the thing.
[2042.42 → 2043.92] Or he will curate it.
[2043.98 → 2045.70] And we're going to show you guys what that looks like.
[2045.80 → 2046.00] Dan,
[2046.06 → 2048.12] do you want to read us a curated message or two?
[2048.22 → 2048.42] Yeah,
[2048.46 → 2048.66] sure.
[2048.72 → 2049.38] I've got a bunch here.
[2049.62 → 2049.94] Hey,
[2050.10 → 2051.76] WAN boys at Linus,
[2051.76 → 2056.44] you and Yvonne have loads of experience building stuff and managing complex projects.
[2056.44 → 2056.74] Now,
[2057.24 → 2058.96] would you ever consider building a house,
[2059.08 → 2060.66] maybe a holiday home or something?
[2061.78 → 2067.84] One of the things that I've learned from all the experience that I have with big projects
[2067.84 → 2074.60] is that every big project will contain so many stumbling blocks and so many fun things
[2074.60 → 2079.28] to learn that just because you have a lot of experience managing projects doesn't necessarily
[2079.28 → 2082.86] mean that all of a sudden you're an expert at everything, and you should just manage any
[2082.86 → 2083.50] kind of project.
[2083.86 → 2084.66] If anything,
[2084.66 → 2086.76] I would say the more experience I get,
[2086.86 → 2092.26] the more I realize that I don't know and the fewer things I can assume.
[2092.86 → 2093.48] I mean,
[2093.60 → 2095.26] let's look at Whale Land,
[2095.50 → 2096.00] for instance.
[2096.18 → 2096.40] Sure.
[2096.56 → 2102.54] When we acquired that building for the badminton club and then also we wanted to do quarterly
[2102.54 → 2103.60] gaming events,
[2103.96 → 2104.60] I kind of went,
[2104.90 → 2105.12] well,
[2105.50 → 2106.60] it's got lots of space.
[2107.06 → 2108.16] It's got lots of power.
[2108.16 → 2109.94] We work out a deal with the neighbours.
[2110.08 → 2111.28] We get some parking in here.
[2111.36 → 2112.36] Everything should be fine.
[2114.54 → 2115.70] How long ago was that?
[2116.96 → 2117.56] Two years?
[2117.70 → 2118.06] Three.
[2118.32 → 2118.66] Two years,
[2118.78 → 2119.54] I think it was two years.
[2119.66 → 2119.78] Was it two?
[2119.90 → 2120.10] Okay.
[2120.20 → 2120.88] I think it was two years.
[2121.44 → 2123.02] You bought the building two years ago?
[2123.38 → 2123.60] Oh,
[2123.64 → 2123.84] easy.
[2124.62 → 2125.40] I thought it was more than that.
[2127.28 → 2127.64] Oh,
[2128.00 → 2128.64] I mean,
[2128.88 → 2129.48] we might have like,
[2130.16 → 2131.78] commercial real estate moves slow.
[2131.96 → 2132.06] Sure.
[2132.06 → 2134.00] We might have like signed papers way before.
[2134.12 → 2134.34] Sure.
[2134.34 → 2135.56] I don't remember when we signed papers.
[2135.68 → 2135.88] Got it.
[2135.88 → 2136.76] Cause remember too,
[2136.82 → 2138.16] it was only going to be half the size.
[2138.74 → 2141.20] And then by the time we actually made a video about it,
[2141.26 → 2142.70] it was two sides.
[2142.96 → 2143.16] Yeah.
[2143.26 → 2143.94] And a whole,
[2144.46 → 2147.94] we had to go tear up most of the blueprints and redo them.
[2147.94 → 2148.50] And it was a whole,
[2148.56 → 2149.10] it was a whole thing.
[2149.14 → 2149.34] Anyway.
[2149.34 → 2158.22] the point is that we are now a couple of years in and the first whale in is tomorrow.
[2160.02 → 2160.38] So,
[2160.38 → 2163.06] oh yeah.
[2163.12 → 2163.38] Okay.
[2163.44 → 2164.02] And homes,
[2164.20 → 2164.46] you know,
[2164.50 → 2166.24] look how long the home Reno took.
[2166.58 → 2166.96] Yeah.
[2167.02 → 2167.86] And that's a Reno.
[2168.54 → 2169.56] And to be clear,
[2169.56 → 2173.24] there are a lot of things that would have gone faster with a ground up build,
[2173.46 → 2175.92] but there are also a lot of things that might not have,
[2175.92 → 2180.00] and that we might've overlooked dude when we were shopping for our current place.
[2180.54 → 2180.82] Oh,
[2181.08 → 2181.44] wow.
[2181.64 → 2183.34] We probably saw 40,
[2183.42 → 2187.80] 50 properties like during the course of the multiple years that we were shopping.
[2187.86 → 2188.68] Our poor realtor.
[2188.68 → 2189.60] Um,
[2189.60 → 2189.78] we,
[2189.82 → 2192.60] we tried to go to a lot of open houses and stuff so that we didn't have to like,
[2192.64 → 2192.86] you know,
[2192.86 → 2193.40] drag him out.
[2193.44 → 2199.42] But the point is we saw a lot of places and I think Luke has actually been to the neighbourhood
[2199.42 → 2202.86] where Yvonne and I saw a lot of places and,
[2202.98 → 2203.38] um,
[2203.78 → 2205.56] there are a lot of custom homes there.
[2205.70 → 2206.50] Oh yeah.
[2206.82 → 2207.44] A lot of,
[2207.44 → 2211.10] a lot of well-intentioned and,
[2211.10 → 2211.56] uh,
[2211.82 → 2212.52] creative,
[2213.00 → 2213.56] weird stuff,
[2213.78 → 2216.84] creative first time home designers.
[2217.32 → 2217.76] Um,
[2217.76 → 2218.60] you know,
[2218.66 → 2222.04] if it works perfectly for you, and you live there forever.
[2222.58 → 2223.02] Yeah.
[2223.32 → 2223.90] Who cares?
[2224.06 → 2224.28] Like,
[2224.30 → 2226.38] I remember seeing this one place that was like,
[2226.76 → 2227.22] I was like,
[2227.26 → 2228.08] why isn't this selling?
[2228.14 → 2228.72] It's huge.
[2228.74 → 2229.72] And it's priced so well,
[2229.72 → 2232.54] like it was probably like 7,000 square feet or something.
[2232.80 → 2234.44] And we get to it, and we realize,
[2234.98 → 2236.34] Oh,
[2236.64 → 2238.68] this only has three bedrooms in it.
[2239.16 → 2241.54] Because they had two kids, and they were like,
[2242.04 → 2242.32] well,
[2242.36 → 2243.68] why would we need another bedroom?
[2243.80 → 2244.44] It's all we need.
[2244.44 → 2245.88] And that's great.
[2245.98 → 2255.82] But unless you have another small family that wants to live in like a mega sized house that just has all these like spaces that don't seem to have any purpose,
[2255.82 → 2258.02] then good luck selling.
[2258.44 → 2260.32] What about second billiards room?
[2261.32 → 2261.84] Exactly.
[2261.84 → 2262.72] It's a
[2262.78 → 2263.18] we saw,
[2263.28 → 2266.38] we saw the one of the places that we saw had a ballroom in it.
[2266.62 → 2266.94] Yeah.
[2267.84 → 2268.38] Which like,
[2268.62 → 2269.30] sure.
[2269.46 → 2270.24] I'm not kidding.
[2270.24 → 2271.36] You're doing a lot of galas.
[2272.28 → 2273.10] Probably not.
[2273.20 → 2273.64] No.
[2273.78 → 2274.90] Like if you're into it.
[2274.96 → 2275.60] Not so much.
[2275.66 → 2276.44] That's wonderful.
[2276.44 → 2276.94] And I'm,
[2277.02 → 2278.12] I'm happy for you,
[2278.20 → 2279.34] but I do not.
[2280.00 → 2280.48] Um,
[2281.24 → 2282.00] I do not,
[2282.08 → 2283.18] I do not ballroom.
[2284.34 → 2284.98] Or I,
[2285.12 → 2285.28] well,
[2285.38 → 2286.12] that depends.
[2286.12 → 2288.68] Are we talking like plastic orbs?
[2288.68 → 2289.04] Cargo.
[2289.18 → 2289.52] Oh,
[2289.88 → 2291.64] cause then I'm super into it.
[2293.80 → 2294.32] Uh,
[2294.32 → 2294.64] anyway.
[2294.74 → 2294.90] Yeah.
[2294.90 → 2297.76] So it was like this comically big house with just like,
[2297.92 → 2299.62] like three bedrooms in it.
[2299.62 → 2300.60] And I was like,
[2300.62 → 2300.98] okay,
[2300.98 → 2301.28] yeah,
[2301.28 → 2302.80] that doesn't really make a ton of sense.
[2302.88 → 2304.92] So people don't tend to build what's balanced.
[2305.04 → 2306.74] They tend to build what works perfectly for them.
[2306.74 → 2313.44] And I think we've seen enough of what's perfectly designed for me to know that probably wouldn't appeal to anyone else.
[2314.12 → 2317.68] So building that house would legitimately be a terrible idea.
[2317.68 → 2320.42] Unless I were to sort of temper my,
[2320.58 → 2326.16] my specific needs and build something that is better suited for the general populace.
[2326.26 → 2326.54] In which case.
[2326.54 → 2326.96] And then almost,
[2327.08 → 2327.58] what's the point?
[2327.66 → 2328.64] Why do I bother?
[2328.80 → 2329.00] Yeah.
[2329.10 → 2331.72] I should just buy a house that's a professional design.
[2332.02 → 2332.40] Honey,
[2332.50 → 2335.00] why is the server room bigger than the living room?
[2335.00 → 2337.58] To fit all the computers,
[2337.78 → 2338.58] obviously.
[2338.98 → 2339.38] Okay.
[2340.54 → 2341.24] What if you,
[2341.28 → 2343.80] what if you worked with an architect who.
[2344.42 → 2345.68] I thought you were supposed to.
[2345.78 → 2346.58] Took just,
[2346.70 → 2348.24] just vague ideas.
[2349.46 → 2350.86] And made you something cool.
[2351.06 → 2351.46] I mean,
[2351.48 → 2352.52] at that point though,
[2352.68 → 2352.96] I mean,
[2353.04 → 2353.78] I,
[2353.84 → 2360.88] I guess the main reason that I wouldn't bother is that we already found a house that was damn close in terms of the bones.
[2361.36 → 2363.86] And then extensively modified it.
[2363.86 → 2365.92] Your place's layout is super cool and unique.
[2366.10 → 2369.64] My layout is like perfect at this point.
[2369.64 → 2370.66] Never seen a place like that.
[2370.74 → 2371.00] It's not,
[2371.14 → 2371.94] it's not perfect,
[2372.06 → 2372.48] but it's,
[2372.52 → 2373.54] it's perfect for me.
[2373.60 → 2373.74] It's,
[2373.86 → 2374.08] we,
[2374.16 → 2375.18] we did change a lot.
[2375.24 → 2377.10] But your needs and wants are going to change.
[2377.10 → 2379.56] So perfect is never really going to fit anyway.
[2379.78 → 2380.14] Dude,
[2380.22 → 2383.40] my eldest is going to be like moved out in like five years.
[2385.78 → 2386.18] Right?
[2386.68 → 2387.04] Sure.
[2387.56 → 2387.92] Crazy.
[2388.64 → 2389.46] In this economy?
[2389.72 → 2390.08] Crazy.
[2390.08 → 2390.16] Yeah.
[2390.26 → 2391.10] I kind of doubt it.
[2391.24 → 2392.84] Depends on how well you set them up.
[2392.84 → 2394.40] Where?
[2395.36 → 2395.98] I don't know.
[2396.04 → 2396.50] On campus.
[2396.62 → 2396.98] I don't know.
[2397.70 → 2398.50] Renting with friends,
[2398.62 → 2398.90] roommates.
[2399.58 → 2399.76] Yeah.
[2399.76 → 2401.72] That's really expensive these days.
[2402.82 → 2405.28] It depends on how much you're helping out.
[2405.46 → 2406.62] That might be a commute.
[2407.20 → 2408.30] That's a long commute.
[2408.82 → 2409.24] Uh,
[2409.24 → 2410.06] it depends on what's cool.
[2410.48 → 2410.72] Yeah.
[2410.74 → 2411.38] That's fair enough.
[2412.06 → 2413.04] Sky train's coming out here.
[2413.54 → 2414.20] That's right.
[2414.76 → 2415.02] Yeah,
[2415.04 → 2415.56] that's true.
[2416.16 → 2416.70] That's true.
[2416.70 → 2418.68] Either way,
[2418.74 → 2419.66] my point is,
[2419.84 → 2421.36] we will legally be an adult.
[2422.36 → 2423.22] In that time.
[2423.38 → 2423.66] Yeah.
[2423.88 → 2426.08] Like that's mind-blowing.
[2426.18 → 2426.86] That's weird.
[2427.38 → 2430.04] My SFU tour was eight years ago.
[2430.58 → 2431.24] You know,
[2431.68 → 2434.14] when he was like this high.
[2434.92 → 2436.56] Time is flying too fast, dude.
[2436.56 → 2436.90] I was talking about,
[2436.90 → 2437.46] um,
[2437.54 → 2438.90] manufacturers say.
[2439.04 → 2439.32] Yeah.
[2439.52 → 2440.06] The other day.
[2440.32 → 2441.82] Because I was talking about like,
[2442.24 → 2442.44] you know,
[2442.44 → 2443.72] I think it's been three,
[2443.84 → 2445.34] four years since we've made one of those.
[2446.34 → 2446.74] Um,
[2447.54 → 2448.08] let's see.
[2448.36 → 2448.76] Three,
[2448.96 → 2449.60] four years,
[2449.70 → 2449.92] dude.
[2450.02 → 2452.04] I thought that was the last one that came up when I looked at it.
[2452.04 → 2452.72] Uh,
[2452.84 → 2453.68] I mean,
[2453.74 → 2454.50] you can check.
[2455.08 → 2455.70] Hold on.
[2455.80 → 2456.84] I'll go Luke laptop here.
[2456.96 → 2457.68] Luke laptop.
[2457.86 → 2458.30] Re-air.
[2459.30 → 2459.62] Re-air.
[2460.10 → 2460.52] Thanks.
[2460.68 → 2461.66] Laptop or any air.
[2461.80 → 2462.68] Laptop any air.
[2463.34 → 2463.82] Anyway.
[2465.24 → 2466.14] Four years ago.
[2467.28 → 2467.72] Oh,
[2468.02 → 2468.48] okay.
[2468.60 → 2469.10] All right.
[2469.32 → 2470.44] Has there been one since then?
[2470.54 → 2471.52] I don't think so.
[2471.78 → 2471.98] Yeah.
[2472.10 → 2472.56] So four years.
[2472.56 → 2475.02] And it was probably years before that one,
[2475.06 → 2477.52] since we had looked at that series.
[2477.66 → 2479.04] Something I did find though,
[2479.12 → 2479.56] is that.
[2479.56 → 2479.72] Hey,
[2479.76 → 2480.10] look,
[2480.18 → 2480.92] I'm always the victim.
[2481.04 → 2481.70] I'm never to blame.
[2482.04 → 2483.06] That's good to know.
[2483.14 → 2483.32] No,
[2483.36 → 2483.44] no,
[2483.44 → 2484.10] you have to go higher.
[2484.98 → 2485.90] Is that new?
[2486.50 → 2486.84] Oh,
[2486.90 → 2487.06] no,
[2487.12 → 2487.92] that's that one.
[2487.98 → 2488.54] Eight months ago.
[2488.68 → 2489.10] Hold on.
[2489.44 → 2489.88] Uh,
[2490.00 → 2490.22] no,
[2490.40 → 2491.12] uh,
[2491.12 → 2491.96] it's not up there.
[2492.12 → 2492.22] Yeah,
[2492.22 → 2493.18] that's a holy,
[2494.10 → 2497.30] but the actual like manufacturers say ones,
[2497.42 → 2498.86] they like always banged.
[2499.12 → 2499.92] They did really well.
[2500.04 → 2501.02] Basically every time.
[2501.44 → 2501.92] Um,
[2502.16 → 2507.84] so I was talking about that series in general and like how it started with like the gigabyte black backplate thing.
[2507.84 → 2508.20] Oh yeah.
[2508.20 → 2508.44] Right.
[2508.44 → 2509.44] All that chaos.
[2510.04 → 2510.48] Um,
[2510.58 → 2511.06] and,
[2511.06 → 2512.16] I,
[2512.24 → 2516.38] I realized that the gigabyte backplate video is like ancient.
[2516.60 → 2517.08] Oh yeah.
[2517.76 → 2518.14] It's like,
[2518.20 → 2519.36] that was 10 years ago.
[2519.48 → 2519.78] Yeah.
[2519.88 → 2520.14] Yeah.
[2520.42 → 2520.82] Yeah.
[2521.02 → 2521.28] Yeah.
[2522.00 → 2525.22] Gigabyte painted their backplates black or something to like help.
[2525.22 → 2525.46] They were,
[2525.46 → 2527.08] they were copper backplates.
[2527.08 → 2527.64] Were they?
[2527.72 → 2527.88] Oh,
[2527.94 → 2528.12] right.
[2528.12 → 2531.88] They said it was over the GPU die, and they said it would like to cool it better or something.
[2531.88 → 2532.74] They said it would lower it by three degrees.
[2532.82 → 2533.30] I'm pretty sure.
[2533.44 → 2533.64] Yeah.
[2533.70 → 2536.96] And the real thing was that their old backplates were terrible.
[2536.96 → 2538.28] So it,
[2538.28 → 2541.34] you could either have this copper backplate or just no backplate.
[2541.34 → 2542.30] And it would have been fine.
[2542.40 → 2543.06] And it would have been fine.
[2543.12 → 2543.28] Right.
[2543.34 → 2545.88] But having their old backplates like increase the temperature.
[2545.88 → 2549.80] So it was a benefit versus having their old bad one.
[2550.20 → 2550.56] Uh,
[2550.56 → 2550.86] if I,
[2550.90 → 2552.36] I think that's how it was,
[2552.36 → 2554.98] but you'd have to watch that old video.
[2555.48 → 2558.48] And I think you'd have to watch the like Instagram video.
[2558.48 → 2559.58] I think that we posted.
[2560.42 → 2561.04] Because they,
[2561.12 → 2561.36] they,
[2561.48 → 2562.86] they like called me,
[2563.06 → 2565.82] their board called me at like three in the morning or something.
[2565.88 → 2567.36] I still have no idea how they got my phone number.
[2568.18 → 2568.54] Um,
[2569.02 → 2570.20] they have their base.
[2570.28 → 2570.62] Yeah.
[2570.76 → 2571.58] And then they,
[2571.74 → 2572.00] they,
[2572.12 → 2572.44] um,
[2573.26 → 2576.26] they like push for me to take the video down, and we were just like,
[2576.42 → 2577.06] no.
[2577.74 → 2578.18] Uh,
[2578.20 → 2578.56] but they,
[2578.60 → 2579.08] but they were like,
[2579.10 → 2579.32] okay,
[2579.32 → 2581.90] we can have our engineers like correct your information for you.
[2581.90 → 2582.38] And I was like,
[2582.60 → 2582.96] okay.
[2583.08 → 2585.10] Their engineers told us the like,
[2585.30 → 2585.46] yeah,
[2585.46 → 2588.64] it's versus our old bad backplate versus nothing.
[2588.70 → 2588.96] It's,
[2589.08 → 2590.04] it's zero change.
[2590.04 → 2591.96] This was like a technical marketing issue.
[2592.14 → 2594.58] So I brought that to their board and was like,
[2594.64 → 2596.38] this is what your people told me.
[2596.38 → 2597.18] And they were like,
[2597.24 → 2597.50] okay,
[2597.50 → 2599.00] please post like an update.
[2599.00 → 2599.46] And I was like,
[2599.48 → 2600.92] you don't want me to do this.
[2601.36 → 2601.98] And they're like,
[2602.02 → 2602.20] no,
[2602.28 → 2602.86] please do it.
[2602.88 → 2603.30] And I was like,
[2603.96 → 2604.52] okay.
[2604.80 → 2605.12] Uh,
[2605.12 → 2606.08] and then it was just bad.
[2606.64 → 2606.94] Yeah.
[2607.16 → 2607.44] Nice.
[2607.44 → 2607.80] I don't know.
[2607.90 → 2608.64] Whole thing was weird.
[2609.08 → 2609.48] Uh,
[2609.68 → 2611.92] it's probably reach out to manufacturers before we post the videos.
[2611.98 → 2612.82] I think we learned that bit.
[2613.28 → 2613.68] Um,
[2614.28 → 2614.80] I mean,
[2615.04 → 2616.08] we weren't even wrong on that.
[2616.08 → 2617.50] Not that we're not going to post it.
[2617.60 → 2617.82] Yeah,
[2617.82 → 2619.96] but I think we don't need to like jump scare people.
[2620.58 → 2621.12] That's true.
[2621.28 → 2622.24] They can at least know it's coming.
[2622.36 → 2622.76] That's true.
[2622.82 → 2625.42] We do have a process now where the
[2625.50 → 2626.08] um,
[2626.38 → 2631.68] the partnerships team gets the schedule of what videos are coming.
[2631.82 → 2633.52] So they can at least be like,
[2633.96 → 2634.18] Hey,
[2634.24 → 2634.74] be ready.
[2635.10 → 2635.32] Yeah.
[2635.54 → 2635.82] Yeah.
[2635.90 → 2636.54] Which is like,
[2636.64 → 2636.96] you know,
[2637.00 → 2638.36] we were going to post it anyway.
[2638.66 → 2638.86] Yeah.
[2638.92 → 2639.50] But like,
[2639.72 → 2640.12] you know,
[2641.04 → 2641.34] at least,
[2641.44 → 2641.54] yeah,
[2641.54 → 2642.26] I think the
[2642.26 → 2642.48] uh,
[2642.48 → 2643.18] I think the
[2643.18 → 2643.52] the
[2643.52 → 2643.86] the
[2643.86 → 2644.18] the
[2644.18 → 2644.42] the
[2644.42 → 2646.00] the sheet for it is like brand,
[2646.10 → 2646.26] uh,
[2646.36 → 2647.94] brand unsafe videos upcoming.
[2647.94 → 2649.42] And they don't,
[2649.54 → 2652.06] they don't interfere with the editorial team,
[2652.06 → 2653.64] but you know,
[2653.64 → 2655.76] it's just nice for them to be,
[2655.82 → 2658.06] to be ready to prepare their inbox.
[2658.54 → 2658.94] Yeah.
[2659.94 → 2660.02] Yeah.
[2660.02 → 2660.34] To,
[2660.42 → 2661.36] to receive an email.
[2662.10 → 2663.36] They knew exactly what they're doing.
[2663.44 → 2664.52] All publicity is good publicity.
[2664.74 → 2664.82] No,
[2664.92 → 2667.16] as much as I slammed them,
[2667.18 → 2668.42] I actually don't agree.
[2668.54 → 2669.02] There was,
[2669.18 → 2674.36] there was people on that call that called me that had genuinely no idea at all what was happening.
[2674.36 → 2676.12] And they thought the claim was real.
[2676.68 → 2683.60] They read it just the way that I did and assumed that it was a real thing that they were claiming.
[2683.60 → 2685.72] And they assumed that they were not lying.
[2686.58 → 2688.42] Someone saw this data,
[2689.00 → 2690.44] either misinterpreted it or,
[2690.54 → 2692.14] or construed it in some way.
[2692.24 → 2694.50] And then that got through and got published.
[2694.64 → 2696.88] Big companies stuff happens.
[2697.10 → 2703.20] It turns out that when you have a thousand or 10,000 or a hundred thousand people,
[2703.20 → 2706.40] they are not all marching in lockstep.
[2706.60 → 2706.88] Yeah.
[2707.16 → 2707.50] And like,
[2707.58 → 2708.66] it just doesn't work like that.
[2708.66 → 2709.00] Okay.
[2709.66 → 2709.84] No,
[2709.88 → 2710.80] it doesn't make it good.
[2710.90 → 2711.16] No.
[2711.78 → 2714.12] But what it does make it is not malicious.
[2714.34 → 2715.02] It's understandable.
[2715.24 → 2716.32] Most of the time.
[2716.42 → 2717.38] Sometimes it totally is.
[2717.38 → 2719.94] Sometimes it seems to be totally malicious.
[2720.10 → 2721.32] I don't know that this one was.
[2721.52 → 2721.66] I,
[2721.66 → 2721.88] I,
[2721.88 → 2722.64] in my opinion,
[2722.64 → 2728.56] I suspect someone on the technical marketing team just didn't understand and just was like,
[2728.66 → 2729.04] oh yeah,
[2729.08 → 2730.44] I see number went up by three.
[2730.62 → 2732.28] So it goes up by three.
[2732.36 → 2732.72] Very good.
[2732.72 → 2733.20] I mean,
[2733.24 → 2742.86] you would be amazed how much of the marketing and sales teams of even like very broadly speaking,
[2742.98 → 2744.38] very technical companies,
[2744.54 → 2745.52] um,
[2745.88 → 2747.32] don't know that much about tech.
[2747.32 → 2748.20] This is also,
[2748.32 → 2754.94] I have also heard from many different people that work in the industry that work on the products themselves.
[2755.16 → 2755.28] Yeah.
[2755.28 → 2755.72] Um,
[2755.72 → 2763.94] I've heard from them about being very frustrated with the technical marketing teams and how they've taken certain claims and exaggerated them.
[2763.94 → 2764.10] Well,
[2764.10 → 2765.78] that's the thing is they're good at sales.
[2765.92 → 2767.28] They're good at marketing.
[2767.42 → 2775.34] They are not necessarily good at tech and don't necessarily care about that because it has nothing to do with their KPIs.
[2775.34 → 2778.32] And the reality of it is that you might say,
[2778.42 → 2778.94] well,
[2779.00 → 2783.88] then it's these companies fault for not hiring more technical people to do sales and marketing.
[2783.88 → 2788.28] But you got to understand sales and marketing have to talk to people.
[2791.36 → 2793.24] I'll leave the rest of it unsaid.
[2793.24 → 2793.48] Yeah.
[2794.68 → 2795.02] And again,
[2795.02 → 2795.94] it doesn't make it okay.
[2796.04 → 2797.08] It doesn't make it good.
[2797.28 → 2798.66] I just understand.
[2799.04 → 2799.44] That's,
[2799.44 → 2800.38] that's all.
[2800.58 → 2800.76] And we,
[2800.90 → 2802.78] and if we want to diagnose the problem,
[2802.78 → 2803.18] we still release the video.
[2803.34 → 2805.18] And if we want to find a way to move forward,
[2805.18 → 2808.78] we have to understand these things because it's our job to work in this industry,
[2808.78 → 2809.44] you know,
[2809.48 → 2809.92] forever.
[2810.74 → 2811.10] Uh,
[2811.26 → 2816.02] so it is what it is.
[2816.26 → 2816.66] Yup.
[2818.70 → 2819.60] Another one.
[2821.08 → 2821.48] Uh,
[2821.56 → 2822.06] sure.
[2822.18 → 2822.32] Oh,
[2822.32 → 2823.24] was that still a merge?
[2823.36 → 2823.76] Yeah,
[2823.76 → 2824.44] that was one.
[2825.02 → 2825.44] Okay,
[2825.94 → 2826.26] sure.
[2827.66 → 2828.72] You made a computer,
[2828.84 → 2830.98] including a case for the YouTuber Kindergarten.
[2831.20 → 2832.14] That's not really a question.
[2833.20 → 2837.46] He now needs a storage server for his external hard drive collection of all his work.
[2838.08 → 2839.26] You want to help him maybe?
[2839.48 → 2840.30] And yes,
[2840.38 → 2841.12] want your stickers.
[2842.32 → 2842.76] Um,
[2843.12 → 2845.14] that was a super cool build.
[2845.92 → 2847.92] I don't know if you ever saw that one of the wood PC.
[2848.10 → 2848.40] It had the
[2848.42 → 2849.82] like working wooden gears.
[2849.82 → 2852.14] Uh,
[2852.14 → 2853.06] like motorized,
[2853.14 → 2853.48] I think.
[2854.02 → 2854.60] Hold on.
[2855.10 → 2855.38] Yeah,
[2855.60 → 2856.04] hold on.
[2856.06 → 2856.30] It was,
[2856.38 → 2857.50] it was pretty cool.
[2857.58 → 2857.70] Yeah,
[2857.70 → 2859.14] the amazing wooden PC.
[2859.94 → 2860.36] Yeah,
[2860.36 → 2861.22] I remember that one.
[2861.52 → 2861.80] Yeah.
[2861.80 → 2862.44] Three years ago.
[2863.24 → 2864.24] That was awesome.
[2864.48 → 2866.14] It was sponsored by SolidWorks.
[2866.78 → 2867.30] Um,
[2867.30 → 2867.76] that's his,
[2867.84 → 2868.40] that's not ours.
[2868.50 → 2869.16] This is ours.
[2869.16 → 2872.80] So we basically laser etched a thing and then we,
[2872.88 → 2874.00] we made these gears turn,
[2874.10 → 2874.46] which was,
[2874.74 → 2875.72] which was super cool.
[2876.42 → 2876.86] Um,
[2877.16 → 2879.82] we haven't really done as much.
[2879.94 → 2880.24] Hey,
[2880.24 → 2883.74] we built a wild PC that was sort of like themed in this way.
[2884.08 → 2884.40] I miss those.
[2884.60 → 2885.32] I liked those a lot.
[2885.44 → 2887.54] I think that's something that we could do more of.
[2887.58 → 2891.00] What I will say is it was something that started to not perform as well.
[2891.12 → 2891.48] Oh,
[2891.48 → 2892.30] um,
[2892.94 → 2893.36] I mean,
[2893.44 → 2893.90] remember,
[2894.02 → 2897.46] it kind of,
[2897.54 → 2900.40] it kind of felt like it had a bit of a
[2900.40 → 2902.02] a bit of a
[2902.02 → 2902.52] um,
[2902.92 → 2904.06] a rise in popularity,
[2904.06 → 2904.90] kind of like,
[2904.94 → 2905.22] you know,
[2905.28 → 2908.06] game themed modded PCs back in the day.
[2908.42 → 2908.90] Uh,
[2908.90 → 2912.54] like you'd go to trade shows and a booth like G skill,
[2912.64 → 2913.06] for instance,
[2913.12 → 2915.14] so it would be nothing but these like wild,
[2915.14 → 2917.22] like modded PCs and stuff like that.
[2917.26 → 2921.46] And then people got kind of numb to it and videos,
[2921.48 → 2923.12] showcasing that kind of thing.
[2923.24 → 2923.48] They,
[2923.58 → 2924.60] they stopped really,
[2924.60 → 2927.02] they stopped really enticing people.
[2927.32 → 2928.56] And where do you think that stopped?
[2928.60 → 2929.12] Cause this is,
[2929.22 → 2930.40] this is three years ago.
[2930.94 → 2933.14] And it's more the momentum.
[2933.64 → 2934.56] YouTube is funky,
[2934.68 → 2934.92] man.
[2935.70 → 2936.14] Um,
[2936.18 → 2937.62] YouTube says three years ago.
[2937.76 → 2938.74] I expand the description.
[2939.00 → 2939.72] It's almost four.
[2939.96 → 2940.36] 2021.
[2941.06 → 2941.34] Yeah.
[2941.88 → 2942.44] Uh,
[2942.46 → 2942.70] Oh,
[2942.82 → 2943.46] 23rd December,
[2943.56 → 2943.96] 2021.
[2944.32 → 2944.56] Yeah.
[2944.56 → 2944.84] Okay.
[2946.04 → 2946.48] Uh,
[2946.56 → 2947.56] yeah,
[2947.60 → 2949.08] it'll be four years ago in December of this year.
[2949.16 → 2949.40] Yeah.
[2949.74 → 2950.78] So anyway,
[2950.78 → 2956.30] the point is that there's probably a lot of people like hundreds of thousands of people out there that are like,
[2956.38 → 2956.70] but I,
[2956.70 → 2958.34] I want to watch those videos.
[2958.46 → 2960.02] I want to watch the crap out of those videos.
[2960.64 → 2961.12] Um,
[2961.24 → 2963.42] but that's the thing that people,
[2963.42 → 2967.58] I think sometimes lose track of,
[2967.58 → 2967.84] or,
[2967.84 → 2971.46] or don't realize is that when we're looking at the numbers,
[2971.46 → 2976.64] we're looking at aggregate numbers and not just individual numbers.
[2976.64 → 2977.54] Um,
[2977.54 → 2988.86] and so it was fascinating over the last couple of weeks as we dived into some of the inside baseball behind YouTube's algorithmic recommendations and how they do or don't register views.
[2989.22 → 2989.54] Uh,
[2989.56 → 2989.78] you know,
[2989.80 → 2990.12] when I,
[2990.20 → 2991.38] ad blocker is,
[2991.54 → 2991.88] um,
[2992.16 → 2993.52] is being used and,
[2993.82 → 2994.32] and we kind of,
[2994.38 → 2995.64] we kind of talked about these things.
[2995.64 → 2996.08] And,
[2996.46 → 2996.86] um,
[2996.86 → 3002.18] the big headline that a lot of people who didn't look that deep into it or listen to what we were saying,
[3002.24 → 3005.98] lobbed onto was that LTT has fallen off,
[3006.30 → 3006.54] right?
[3006.56 → 3010.52] Like that was kind of the takeaway for anyone who wanted that to be the takeaway.
[3010.52 → 3016.60] And I'll be the first to tell you guys that our viewership is not as high as it was three years ago.
[3017.12 → 3017.56] Um,
[3018.48 → 3022.92] but we also haven't fallen off completely either.
[3023.14 → 3025.02] And that's not necessarily the conclusion,
[3025.02 → 3026.92] but that doesn't change that,
[3026.92 → 3027.74] uh,
[3027.92 → 3029.82] opinions are like assholes.
[3030.10 → 3032.26] And many people had opinions about,
[3032.36 → 3032.56] you know,
[3032.62 → 3034.90] what specific content it was of ours.
[3035.00 → 3037.02] That was the reason that we had fallen off,
[3037.30 → 3039.80] whether it was because we were doing content that was bad,
[3039.80 → 3043.82] or because we had stopped doing content that was perfect.
[3044.18 → 3044.66] And,
[3044.76 → 3045.00] uh,
[3045.00 → 3052.72] one of the funniest ones for me was people on both sides saying they build too many computers, and I'm bored with it.
[3052.98 → 3054.54] Or on the other side going,
[3054.92 → 3057.56] they don't build enough computers anymore.
[3057.66 → 3058.62] That's what I want to watch.
[3058.88 → 3062.72] Do you think it might've been oversaturated, and now it's cooled down, and we could hit it again?
[3062.80 → 3063.90] And being equally certain.
[3064.20 → 3064.48] No,
[3064.56 → 3065.22] I don't.
[3065.30 → 3065.66] Um,
[3065.80 → 3069.70] build a PC as a genre is highly competitive.
[3069.80 → 3071.54] Because it's super easy to do.
[3072.12 → 3073.26] And it's,
[3073.26 → 3073.92] um,
[3073.98 → 3076.82] it's one where I feel like you,
[3076.96 → 3084.40] we especially are inherently going to struggle with it because there's almost nothing for us to say that we've never said before.
[3084.82 → 3087.60] That was why we did build a
[3087.66 → 3088.24] how to build a PC,
[3088.34 → 3089.32] the last guide you'll ever need.
[3089.70 → 3091.84] Because what's the last one that you,
[3092.36 → 3093.12] what's the last,
[3093.24 → 3093.50] like,
[3093.50 → 3094.00] uh,
[3094.00 → 3097.76] we did a POV one more recently because it had been quite a while.
[3097.96 → 3101.48] And I felt that we were due for an update because the first POV build guide,
[3101.60 → 3103.34] and it really is the easiest one to follow along with.
[3103.34 → 3105.42] But the amazing wooden PC is not a build guide,
[3105.42 → 3105.80] is it?
[3106.28 → 3106.74] It's like a
[3107.28 → 3107.62] no,
[3107.72 → 3108.02] that's,
[3108.10 → 3108.20] no,
[3108.24 → 3108.32] no,
[3108.32 → 3108.42] no.
[3108.42 → 3109.00] That one's like,
[3109.04 → 3110.06] it's like a build log.
[3110.24 → 3110.46] Yeah.
[3110.46 → 3110.82] Uh,
[3110.82 → 3111.24] it's like,
[3111.28 → 3111.50] yeah,
[3111.56 → 3111.92] four years,
[3111.98 → 3112.58] four years ago.
[3112.70 → 3114.88] So more recently we did the
[3115.00 → 3115.30] um,
[3115.90 → 3116.36] uh,
[3116.36 → 3118.24] the acoustic baffle one was pretty cool.
[3118.30 → 3119.78] The most like silent PC.
[3120.30 → 3120.72] Um,
[3122.08 → 3122.70] we did,
[3122.78 → 3124.62] I'd say we've taken the
[3124.62 → 3126.88] the idea, and we've adapted a little bit.
[3126.88 → 3129.38] So we did buyer DIY with the arcade cabinet.
[3129.60 → 3130.14] In fact,
[3130.16 → 3132.14] that's the thing that's behind me right here.
[3132.42 → 3132.80] Um,
[3132.80 → 3134.94] that was a cool build log,
[3135.14 → 3137.28] like building a PC and a novel form factor.
[3137.46 → 3137.98] We've just,
[3138.08 → 3140.30] we've tried to add another layer to it other than just,
[3140.46 → 3141.80] we built a computer,
[3141.80 → 3142.36] uh,
[3142.36 → 3144.62] because they started to be pretty sluggish for us.
[3145.32 → 3145.72] Um,
[3145.84 → 3146.20] anyway,
[3146.32 → 3147.60] I'm like another one that,
[3147.72 → 3149.32] that people are sort of quick to,
[3149.38 → 3151.08] to diagnose as like the
[3151.14 → 3152.44] the reason that we're,
[3153.02 → 3153.42] you know,
[3153.42 → 3156.44] we're falling off is because we need to do more of it or because we need to do
[3156.44 → 3157.60] less of it is,
[3157.60 → 3158.14] um,
[3159.62 → 3160.16] Oh man,
[3160.22 → 3160.48] actually,
[3160.54 → 3160.64] no,
[3160.68 → 3160.96] I forgot.
[3161.08 → 3161.82] I had it in my brain,
[3161.92 → 3162.88] but now I've forgotten.
[3163.10 → 3163.94] And honestly,
[3163.94 → 3165.54] it's probably boring anyway.
[3165.66 → 3166.34] So why don't,
[3166.44 → 3167.00] why don't we move on?
[3167.10 → 3167.64] We can do it,
[3167.70 → 3168.28] do a new topic.
[3168.42 → 3169.38] I forget what the question was.
[3169.42 → 3170.44] Did I ever actually answer it?
[3171.20 → 3171.56] Oh,
[3171.72 → 3172.84] could we do a NAS?
[3173.16 → 3173.52] Uh,
[3173.62 → 3173.86] huh,
[3173.90 → 3174.18] man,
[3174.24 → 3176.98] that's one where you can only build Cases so many times.
[3177.20 → 3177.56] Um,
[3177.88 → 3180.10] if he reaches out and kind of,
[3180.10 → 3180.32] you know,
[3180.32 → 3183.04] lays out what he needs and if we can come up with a unique idea,
[3183.04 → 3184.08] um,
[3184.16 → 3184.38] you know,
[3184.38 → 3186.42] make it so like if a hard drive fails,
[3186.42 → 3188.68] it drops a marble in his machine.
[3189.46 → 3190.58] That'd be kind of cool.
[3191.36 → 3191.76] Um,
[3191.98 → 3192.88] you could totally do that.
[3193.32 → 3195.36] We have a lot of projects right now,
[3195.36 → 3198.56] so I'm not in a position where I could say like,
[3198.62 → 3198.92] oh yeah,
[3198.98 → 3199.50] we could like,
[3199.54 → 3200.66] we could execute that on,
[3200.92 → 3203.84] we could execute on that in like a super reasonable amount of time.
[3204.02 → 3205.74] So I don't want to commit anything,
[3205.94 → 3207.52] but anything's possible.
[3208.02 → 3208.30] Um,
[3208.30 → 3209.58] in the case of that PC,
[3209.58 → 3213.60] we had a perfect sponsor that was super adjacent to what we were doing.
[3213.60 → 3216.60] So sometimes it can rely on that because these can be huge projects.
[3217.32 → 3217.72] Um,
[3217.78 → 3218.54] and sometimes,
[3218.66 → 3218.80] you know,
[3218.80 → 3219.76] we can't get all the hardware,
[3219.76 → 3223.20] so we can't just go building like multi thousand dollar,
[3223.20 → 3229.10] like Cases for people just out of our own pocket for no reason other than because they asked us for one necessarily.
[3229.68 → 3229.80] Uh,
[3229.80 → 3231.24] that's one of the reasons that we'll,
[3231.34 → 3231.48] you know,
[3231.50 → 3234.54] we'll go, and we'll bring in a sponsor or something like that and try to make it,
[3234.60 → 3234.74] you know,
[3234.78 → 3235.52] wins for everyone,
[3235.92 → 3236.68] win for the sponsor,
[3236.80 → 3237.64] win for our channel,
[3237.74 → 3238.48] win for the audience.
[3238.48 → 3239.58] They really enjoyed the content.
[3239.66 → 3241.04] Win for the other creator who gets,
[3241.04 → 3241.54] you know,
[3241.54 → 3242.36] hooked up with this stuff.
[3242.42 → 3242.80] We try to,
[3242.90 → 3245.56] we try to stack double use as much as we can.
[3246.94 → 3247.56] Oh yeah.
[3247.64 → 3247.82] Right.
[3247.86 → 3250.72] I remember what the other genre was really expensive stuff.
[3252.00 → 3252.40] It,
[3252.56 → 3256.52] it is hilarious watching the
[3256.52 → 3263.98] the community broadly not agree on whether we should cover like outlandishly expensive stuff.
[3263.98 → 3265.00] I don't think they ever have.
[3265.14 → 3267.72] They never have and never will.
[3267.80 → 3268.06] Yeah.
[3269.02 → 3270.90] Every single video we upload,
[3271.04 → 3271.68] that's like,
[3271.68 → 3275.00] here I am unboxing the world's biggest TV,
[3275.00 → 3276.86] or here's a
[3276.86 → 3279.00] a $30,000 GPU.
[3279.52 → 3280.92] It's going to have,
[3281.04 → 3283.78] it's going to have some common thread under it.
[3283.88 → 3284.44] That's people,
[3284.58 → 3291.54] that is people discussing how I remember when LTT used to be reasonably priced stuff for reasonable folks.
[3292.84 → 3295.06] It was never ever.
[3295.06 → 3296.18] It never,
[3296.18 → 3296.62] ever,
[3296.62 → 3296.68] ever,
[3296.68 → 3297.24] ever,
[3297.24 → 3298.28] ever was.
[3299.20 → 3301.02] And I don't,
[3301.02 → 3302.52] but it always was.
[3302.74 → 3304.98] And it always will be like,
[3305.08 → 3305.86] how about this one?
[3306.32 → 3309.48] For tech YouTubers were challenged to build the best thousand dollar gaming PC.
[3309.60 → 3310.34] That was a month ago.
[3310.34 → 3311.50] Um,
[3311.86 → 3315.80] here's a review of a mid-range GPU.
[3316.80 → 3317.60] You know,
[3317.80 → 3321.76] here's scrapyard wars where we literally are trying to get the best deals.
[3321.94 → 3324.16] That's the entire premise of it.
[3324.16 → 3325.22] Um,
[3325.28 → 3326.70] so it's always been,
[3326.78 → 3328.64] here's make your GPU faster for $7.
[3330.12 → 3331.64] It's always been both.
[3332.22 → 3334.16] And this is going to blow your mind.
[3334.76 → 3337.04] You can watch the videos that appeal to you.
[3339.80 → 3340.52] I know,
[3341.08 → 3341.88] I know it's wild.
[3342.42 → 3342.86] It's wild.
[3342.98 → 3344.74] I don't know if I don't watch every single one,
[3344.80 → 3345.82] I get the shakes.
[3346.26 → 3347.68] I do think you kind of miss out.
[3347.68 → 3358.40] I think that I think that the team does an incredible job of making sure that there's fun and educational bits in pretty much everything we upload.
[3358.48 → 3362.34] I'm only hedging because there has got to have been something at some point.
[3362.52 → 3364.72] The content's so dense these days.
[3364.96 → 3366.26] There's so much stuff going on.
[3366.30 → 3370.20] Every video is like 20 minutes, and it's like 20 edited down minutes.
[3370.92 → 3371.24] Yeah.
[3371.44 → 3374.28] I don't know how we used to do a 10-minute video anymore.
[3374.28 → 3376.24] Like maybe,
[3376.38 → 3378.08] maybe that's something that we should explore.
[3378.20 → 3380.10] Like do a 10-minute video once in a while.
[3380.56 → 3380.68] Yeah.
[3380.78 → 3381.20] But like,
[3381.66 → 3382.08] okay.
[3382.50 → 3383.40] Can you imagine?
[3383.54 → 3383.68] Okay.
[3383.70 → 3385.30] Did you watch the one on the giant,
[3385.38 → 3385.98] um,
[3386.32 → 3386.54] uh,
[3386.54 → 3387.14] display volume?
[3387.76 → 3388.12] Yes.
[3388.28 → 3388.56] Okay.
[3389.42 → 3390.48] What could we have cut out?
[3390.48 → 3391.46] You can't do that in 10 minutes.
[3391.54 → 3393.36] How could we have cut 11 minutes out of that?
[3393.36 → 3394.42] I almost wanted to see more.
[3394.56 → 3395.40] And I'm not even like.
[3395.42 → 3396.56] We did cut out a bunch.
[3396.58 → 3396.74] Yeah,
[3396.76 → 3397.04] I'm sure.
[3397.04 → 3397.44] Like we,
[3397.44 → 3398.36] we had to be,
[3398.50 → 3400.84] we had to aggressively cut that down.
[3401.60 → 3402.96] It's such a cool video.
[3403.18 → 3403.60] Like I,
[3403.60 → 3404.40] I remember this,
[3404.60 → 3406.24] this video nine years ago.
[3406.40 → 3407.18] Oh my God.
[3407.66 → 3408.14] Uh,
[3408.26 → 3409.10] this video.
[3409.46 → 3409.72] Yeah.
[3409.88 → 3412.60] I thought it was incredibly long at 16 minutes.
[3412.60 → 3414.22] I gave you shit because I was like,
[3414.26 → 3415.46] this script is too long,
[3415.52 → 3415.62] buddy.
[3415.76 → 3416.00] No one,
[3416.06 → 3418.34] ain't nobody got attention span for that.
[3418.36 → 3418.60] Yeah.
[3418.96 → 3422.08] And now we regularly release like 20 to 30 minute long.
[3422.08 → 3424.32] When's the last time we had a 16-minute video?
[3424.88 → 3426.08] Not yesterday's,
[3426.84 → 3428.28] not this DOG rig reboot.
[3428.38 → 3429.38] That's 23 minutes.
[3429.78 → 3430.68] Weirdest parts on AliExpress,
[3430.78 → 3431.22] 19 minutes,
[3431.32 → 3432.02] 19 minutes,
[3432.02 → 3432.80] uh,
[3432.80 → 3433.44] 29 minutes,
[3433.52 → 3434.38] 21 minutes,
[3434.70 → 3435.66] 16 minutes.
[3435.88 → 3436.32] There.
[3437.12 → 3439.74] We have to go back to the Bose sound cannon,
[3439.94 → 3441.10] acoustic wave cannon.
[3441.32 → 3442.38] And technically that one's still longer.
[3442.38 → 3443.42] Cause mine is 16,
[3443.60 → 3444.02] 19.
[3444.18 → 3444.68] That was 16,
[3444.68 → 3445.06] 24.
[3445.32 → 3445.60] So,
[3445.82 → 3446.38] uh,
[3446.38 → 3447.98] summarizing an Apple event.
[3447.98 → 3450.30] we managed to make that shorter.
[3451.06 → 3453.14] One iPhone announcement.
[3456.32 → 3457.00] But there's,
[3457.10 → 3457.74] I don't know.
[3457.80 → 3458.38] There's just people.
[3458.56 → 3462.40] I don't know how to address that because if we say more,
[3462.52 → 3463.32] people get bored.
[3463.46 → 3464.98] And if we say less,
[3465.62 → 3467.16] people feel like it's incomplete.
[3467.84 → 3468.06] May.
[3468.14 → 3468.58] And maybe,
[3468.72 → 3469.08] maybe,
[3469.28 → 3470.04] maybe that's,
[3470.10 → 3471.38] maybe that's partly on us.
[3471.38 → 3472.82] Like maybe we just need to be like,
[3472.86 → 3473.08] okay,
[3473.20 → 3473.34] yeah,
[3473.34 → 3474.72] we're just not going to include everything.
[3475.06 → 3476.90] Maybe we should go back to shorter videos.
[3476.98 → 3477.90] It's something we've talked about.
[3478.12 → 3478.24] Oh,
[3478.36 → 3478.88] here we go.
[3478.96 → 3480.62] Because it's very burdensome on the editors.
[3481.00 → 3482.54] It's burdensome on the writing department.
[3482.90 → 3485.04] The only other one I did in that series,
[3485.50 → 3485.94] eight minutes,
[3486.02 → 3486.80] 31 seconds.
[3486.80 → 3488.12] Yeah.
[3490.44 → 3490.80] Yeah.
[3491.10 → 3492.06] I remember when I,
[3492.14 → 3493.80] when I had my like float plane weeks,
[3493.84 → 3498.40] we do these things on float plane where we'll pick like a person, and you make three pieces of content.
[3498.40 → 3498.88] And it's,
[3498.92 → 3501.40] it's a week dedicated to like your pieces of content.
[3501.52 → 3504.98] I made a video in there that was like about,
[3504.98 → 3505.98] uh,
[3505.98 → 3507.44] the state of the video game industry.
[3507.84 → 3510.00] And it was like four and a half minutes or something.
[3510.36 → 3510.98] But I mean,
[3511.00 → 3511.88] there are no ads.
[3511.98 → 3513.12] I kick right into it.
[3513.54 → 3515.72] There's no need for like an intro and outro or anything.
[3515.72 → 3517.44] There's no appetizer.
[3517.70 → 3520.16] So I just go straight into the topic and talk about it.
[3520.40 → 3522.10] I got everything I needed to say in.
[3522.56 → 3526.66] It ended up being like very true with how things have been going on.
[3527.08 → 3527.52] Uh,
[3527.56 → 3529.26] and people were pissed because it wasn't longer.
[3529.72 → 3530.64] And I was just saying,
[3530.70 → 3533.10] I remember reading the comments and I remember just thinking like,
[3533.14 → 3538.46] that wasn't even that short of a script for like back when I used to make videos.
[3538.86 → 3539.54] Like if you,
[3539.64 → 3542.40] if you add in like ad spot,
[3542.48 → 3543.02] beginning end,
[3543.12 → 3543.46] an intro,
[3543.46 → 3544.14] an intro,
[3544.42 → 3545.56] a longer outro,
[3545.72 → 3547.40] like all that stuff that you would normally have.
[3547.52 → 3550.00] That's probably about the length of this.
[3550.42 → 3550.60] Yeah.
[3550.68 → 3551.38] What is going on with that?
[3551.38 → 3556.52] Maybe like 50 to 70 seconds of bloat just from kind of adding all that stuff.
[3556.62 → 3556.84] Yeah.
[3557.58 → 3558.20] But no,
[3558.36 → 3559.06] now it's,
[3559.06 → 3561.96] it's 20 plus long minute videos.
[3562.14 → 3562.42] Wild.
[3562.58 → 3563.08] It's crazy.
[3565.28 → 3565.68] Dan,
[3565.72 → 3566.52] what are we supposed to be doing?
[3567.56 → 3569.42] It's got a couple more topics in there.
[3569.56 → 3569.98] Heck yeah.
[3569.98 → 3574.16] Google reveals its Android PC coming in 2026.
[3574.16 → 3576.20] Back in July 2025.
[3576.68 → 3577.12] Okay.
[3577.22 → 3577.56] So this,
[3577.90 → 3578.78] so two months ago,
[3579.40 → 3581.14] Google's Android president,
[3581.22 → 3581.92] Samir Sadat,
[3581.94 → 3588.86] confirmed in a tech radar interview that they will be combining Chrome OS and Android into a single platform.
[3589.20 → 3592.34] The interview was very broad and not Chrome OS focused,
[3592.34 → 3598.02] but Sadat did mention he was very interested in laptop productivity, and they are combining Android and Chrome OS.
[3598.58 → 3598.96] All right.
[3599.10 → 3601.82] Fast forward to Qualcomm's Snapdragon summit,
[3602.22 → 3603.12] September 24th,
[3603.20 → 3603.62] 2025.
[3604.34 → 3605.90] So two days ago.
[3606.58 → 3609.48] Sadat says they're committed to the Chrome OS platform.
[3609.48 → 3613.32] Does that mean older Chrome OS systems will still receive support?
[3613.74 → 3614.70] Hasn't been confirmed.
[3615.30 → 3621.48] Sadat also stated that Android tablets have shown to be a productivity machine and a success for them.
[3621.64 → 3623.66] So basically we can't believe anything he says.
[3623.76 → 3624.12] Okay.
[3624.28 → 3625.32] That's fascinating.
[3625.32 → 3627.22] Because I read these notes before the show.
[3627.32 → 3632.58] I read that one line and I had that exact word for word reaction of just like,
[3632.64 → 3634.06] none of this matters anymore.
[3634.32 → 3635.78] That's obviously a lie.
[3635.78 → 3636.14] Hmm.
[3640.54 → 3640.98] Interesting.
[3641.20 → 3641.60] Yeah.
[3642.22 → 3642.54] Does he,
[3642.62 → 3644.26] is he thinking of iPads?
[3646.16 → 3646.60] Yeah,
[3646.64 → 3647.36] pretty much.
[3647.80 → 3648.16] I mean,
[3648.20 → 3649.36] Android tablets exist,
[3649.66 → 3650.58] but like they,
[3650.58 → 3652.64] they seem to be like signup giveaways.
[3653.72 → 3654.62] You know what I mean?
[3654.70 → 3655.30] Like they're not,
[3655.30 → 3656.06] they're not really.
[3656.16 → 3656.36] No,
[3656.42 → 3657.18] they're expensive.
[3657.56 → 3657.84] Dude,
[3657.92 → 3658.04] no,
[3658.14 → 3663.26] I only know this because I was trying to remember when we used to use a big Android tablet for our Teleprompter.
[3663.40 → 3663.56] Yeah.
[3663.56 → 3665.88] And I was trying to buy new ones, and I was like,
[3665.94 → 3666.32] oh my God,
[3666.34 → 3667.32] I'm not spending five,
[3667.42 → 3668.66] $600 on an Android tablet.
[3668.76 → 3669.40] This is ridiculous.
[3669.60 → 3674.30] And I had to go find some ancient honeycomb thing that was like someone was selling used.
[3674.38 → 3674.56] And there,
[3674.60 → 3674.82] it was,
[3674.94 → 3677.34] it was a really weird deal for some reason.
[3677.64 → 3678.00] Like,
[3678.02 → 3680.48] I think it turned out like they knew me when I got it.
[3680.48 → 3681.00] It doesn't matter.
[3681.06 → 3682.44] The point is that like,
[3682.50 → 3682.64] I,
[3682.64 → 3685.76] I got another one of those old like Terra two tablets.
[3686.76 → 3686.80] And,
[3686.80 → 3687.90] and we had,
[3687.98 → 3690.18] I had to figure out how to like to install a new OS on it.
[3690.18 → 3691.74] I had to do some like 80 B shit.
[3691.74 → 3692.06] Like,
[3692.36 → 3692.46] yeah,
[3692.46 → 3697.78] it was a whole thing because I didn't want to spend more than like a couple of hundred bucks on an Android tablet because they're not worth that to me.
[3698.20 → 3698.52] So,
[3698.52 → 3700.06] but to be clear,
[3700.12 → 3701.66] there are very cheap Android tablets.
[3701.80 → 3701.98] Yeah,
[3702.04 → 3703.10] but they're really crappy.
[3703.50 → 3703.86] Oh,
[3704.08 → 3704.34] yeah.
[3704.70 → 3711.00] So I wanted something that was in that middle ground of like being decent because I was going to use it for a Teleprompter.
[3711.04 → 3712.80] I needed the screen to be good, and I needed the
[3712.96 → 3713.18] you know,
[3713.22 → 3714.78] performance to be okay and stuff.
[3714.82 → 3715.70] I needed to be reliable.
[3715.70 → 3716.56] Um,
[3716.84 → 3717.44] but also,
[3717.52 → 3718.48] and I needed to be big.
[3718.68 → 3719.86] It doesn't need to be that great,
[3719.96 → 3720.78] but it needs to be reliable.
[3721.02 → 3723.78] I wanted a 10-inch tablet and there was like nothing in that class.
[3723.84 → 3724.74] This is years ago though.
[3725.10 → 3725.32] Uh,
[3725.32 → 3728.20] there was nothing in that size class that was like reasonably priced.
[3728.64 → 3729.00] Um,
[3729.02 → 3729.72] and so I was just,
[3729.76 → 3732.30] I was blown away by how expensive Android tablets are, and they still are.
[3732.34 → 3733.78] Like if you want to buy a Samsung or something,
[3733.84 → 3734.50] they're not cheap.
[3735.20 → 3735.52] Yeah.
[3735.54 → 3735.74] I mean,
[3735.76 → 3737.10] I didn't even like,
[3737.20 → 3738.54] this is 800 bucks.
[3738.80 → 3741.72] I do wonder if in other markets they're doing okay.
[3741.72 → 3743.20] Like how many reviews are there for that?
[3743.20 → 3744.52] Uh,
[3744.58 → 3745.38] 126.
[3745.52 → 3745.76] Okay.
[3745.80 → 3747.08] So they're clearly selling some.
[3747.36 → 3749.82] I'm fairly certain Best Buy reviews are unified.
[3750.06 → 3751.06] I think it's both sites.
[3754.12 → 3754.68] Oh,
[3755.22 → 3756.12] so,
[3756.26 → 3758.68] and maybe in other markets they're doing really great.
[3759.60 → 3759.92] Oh,
[3760.36 → 3762.14] okay.
[3762.28 → 3765.68] So they've aggregated reviews from Lord only knows where.
[3765.82 → 3766.24] Yeah.
[3766.44 → 3766.76] Interesting.
[3767.16 → 3770.34] These are like all that way.
[3770.68 → 3771.04] Okay.
[3771.58 → 3771.90] Cute.
[3772.42 → 3772.68] Hmm.
[3772.68 → 3773.58] Um,
[3773.76 → 3774.02] okay.
[3774.10 → 3774.72] That's weird.
[3774.90 → 3775.36] They also,
[3775.54 → 3778.86] and this is where your eyes might really roll completely out of their sockets.
[3779.20 → 3779.60] Um,
[3779.68 → 3784.24] they specifically want to bring the advancements with AI on Android to Chrome OS.
[3787.64 → 3788.16] Neat.
[3788.78 → 3790.00] The solution then,
[3790.22 → 3794.58] Google is combining Android and Chrome OS to make a new OS for PCs.
[3794.58 → 3796.86] The baseline of Android for,
[3796.86 → 3802.28] for PCs will be Android as a base with the Chrome OS experience on top of it.
[3802.54 → 3805.64] This appears to be a collaborative effort between Google,
[3805.86 → 3806.30] Qualcomm,
[3806.38 → 3807.76] and other partners that weren't mentioned.
[3808.88 → 3809.84] The senior VP of,
[3809.92 → 3810.10] uh,
[3810.10 → 3817.92] a senior VP of Google announced they specifically want to bring their AI stack and development into the PC domain, so Android can serve everyone in every computing category,
[3818.12 → 3821.28] since they've already been available for smart home and auto devices.
[3821.86 → 3823.58] Personal computing has been a gap for them.
[3824.72 → 3824.96] Blah,
[3825.00 → 3825.26] blah,
[3825.52 → 3825.78] blah,
[3825.94 → 3826.08] blah,
[3826.16 → 3826.38] blah.
[3826.38 → 3829.06] Not much more has been revealed about their plans at the moment.
[3829.38 → 3831.06] And the latest announcement was more of a tease,
[3831.16 → 3834.06] but it does seem that Google has been working to improve Android with Linux apps.
[3834.30 → 3834.70] Ooh.
[3836.30 → 3839.08] The future for Chrome OS devices hasn't been explicitly covered,
[3839.16 → 3841.10] but Google's policy is 10 years of updates.
[3841.24 → 3843.68] So I'm going to hold them to that because I just bought a Chromebook.
[3845.10 → 3851.26] And Android authority mentioned that GPU acceleration has been slyly added to Android's Linux terminal app.
[3851.26 → 3852.30] It doesn't work yet,
[3852.40 → 3854.74] but it does show that they're looking to improve performance.
[3854.74 → 3860.90] Google stated the end goal is to create an Android ecosystem that works seamlessly across devices.
[3861.68 → 3862.12] Well,
[3862.16 → 3862.44] good luck,
[3862.52 → 3862.70] Google.
[3863.50 → 3864.98] Hopefully you don't abandon it.
[3866.68 → 3867.08] Uh,
[3867.30 → 3868.68] before you minimize that,
[3868.78 → 3870.62] I threw some stuff at the bottom.
[3870.80 → 3872.34] I don't necessarily think I saw these in the doc,
[3872.40 → 3873.60] but I think they're super new.
[3873.68 → 3874.00] So I don't,
[3874.34 → 3876.40] I'm not blaming the doc writers to be clear.
[3877.16 → 3877.60] Um,
[3877.78 → 3879.78] do you know about the new Facebook thing?
[3880.18 → 3880.58] No.
[3881.06 → 3881.46] Facebook.
[3882.14 → 3882.42] Oh,
[3882.48 → 3883.10] what is it called?
[3883.46 → 3883.66] Sure.
[3883.72 → 3884.36] Chat will tell us.
[3884.36 → 3885.98] They're making a new feed.
[3886.82 → 3890.48] That is just a feed of people's like AI generated,
[3890.48 → 3892.18] like mood videos.
[3893.78 → 3896.34] It sounds like the dumbest thing in the world.
[3901.14 → 3905.62] The saddest part is like super smart people work at meta.
[3905.62 → 3908.00] They could be doing anything.
[3908.24 → 3909.00] They could be,
[3909.08 → 3910.74] they could be building the future.
[3913.24 → 3913.60] Yeah.
[3913.74 → 3914.12] It's called,
[3914.16 → 3916.68] so it's called Facebook meta vibes,
[3916.84 → 3917.28] AI.
[3917.78 → 3918.14] Okay.
[3918.36 → 3919.58] Are you ready to screen share?
[3919.58 → 3920.40] Vibes AI.
[3920.40 → 3921.32] Hold on one sec.
[3922.28 → 3922.76] Tech crunch.
[3922.84 → 3922.98] Sure.
[3923.04 → 3923.54] We'll go with that.
[3923.88 → 3924.12] Sure.
[3924.26 → 3924.64] Go for it.
[3924.84 → 3925.36] There we go.
[3925.90 → 3926.90] Meta launches vibes,
[3927.04 → 3929.86] a short form video feed of AI slop.
[3931.14 → 3931.80] And yeah,
[3931.86 → 3932.16] in a move,
[3932.20 → 3933.64] no one asked for meta is introducing vibes,
[3933.70 → 3935.50] a new feed in the meta AI app.
[3935.50 → 3937.12] And on meta.
[3937.12 → 3940.98] For sharing and creating short form AI generated videos.
[3941.68 → 3942.42] That's it.
[3943.42 → 3944.70] Who wants this?
[3948.06 → 3948.54] Why?
[3948.96 → 3953.40] So that you can just aimlessly doom scroll even more.
[3953.40 → 3957.92] But it's just like trash.
[3959.10 → 3959.72] I mean,
[3960.56 → 3962.08] like someone in full plane chat was like,
[3962.14 → 3964.76] remember that two-week period when Luke was all excited about AI stuff?
[3964.90 → 3969.72] I am still quite interested in AI stuff.
[3969.78 → 3969.86] Wait,
[3969.88 → 3970.68] you don't want to watch this?
[3971.12 → 3978.70] But like the direction of almost every corporation and how they're handling with it is just so uninteresting.
[3980.70 → 3981.14] Like,
[3981.24 → 3982.32] I think it's called like,
[3982.32 → 3985.42] friend.com or something.
[3986.02 → 3986.70] Oh boy.
[3987.18 → 3987.56] Oh boy.
[3987.58 → 3988.36] Have you heard of that?
[3988.50 → 3989.46] I unboxed it.
[3989.70 → 3990.08] Oh.
[3992.64 → 3999.98] If you enjoy Linus gets mad about how utterly pointless and wasteful something is,
[4000.44 → 4003.68] tune in to short circuit where I unbox.
[4004.66 → 4005.06] Oh,
[4005.48 → 4005.72] no,
[4005.80 → 4006.52] I literally,
[4006.68 → 4007.14] I had it.
[4007.22 → 4007.24] Oh,
[4007.28 → 4008.16] I just closed it.
[4008.38 → 4008.40] Oh,
[4008.40 → 4008.52] wow.
[4008.58 → 4008.94] Did I talk,
[4009.02 → 4009.20] man,
[4009.28 → 4012.30] I looked at his screen and clicked it, and it was,
[4012.32 → 4012.62] gone.
[4013.12 → 4015.34] I unboxed my friend.
[4016.02 → 4017.00] I named it Riley.
[4019.88 → 4021.32] I prefer the real Riley.
[4021.60 → 4021.86] Yeah.
[4021.94 → 4022.10] Yeah.
[4022.10 → 4022.18] Yeah.
[4022.18 → 4022.40] Yeah.
[4022.70 → 4023.60] Is this old?
[4024.30 → 4024.68] Uh,
[4024.76 → 4025.44] it's old.
[4025.60 → 4025.78] The
[4025.90 → 4027.56] the trailer there is old.
[4027.82 → 4028.06] Yeah.
[4028.06 → 4029.56] This went viral way back,
[4029.98 → 4030.64] but we,
[4030.70 → 4032.02] they actually shipped us one now.
[4032.18 → 4032.54] Okay.
[4032.62 → 4032.88] Got it.
[4032.88 → 4032.98] Yeah.
[4032.98 → 4034.90] So I was going to say they did like an ad takeover.
[4035.02 → 4035.26] Yeah.
[4035.38 → 4035.54] Yeah.
[4035.54 → 4035.78] Yeah.
[4035.78 → 4036.02] Yeah.
[4036.02 → 4036.18] Yeah.
[4036.18 → 4036.46] Uh,
[4036.46 → 4038.38] they didn't add take over the New York subway.
[4038.78 → 4042.06] Bell has actually been wearing it since the short circuit.
[4042.32 → 4043.36] Because he was like,
[4043.36 → 4045.52] maybe Linus was too mean.
[4045.94 → 4052.02] I should use it a bit more and make sure that it's actually as worthless and pointless as he made it out to be.
[4052.42 → 4053.22] And he came,
[4053.34 → 4055.50] he came back to me a few days later, and he's like,
[4055.62 → 4055.86] Hey,
[4056.32 → 4059.22] so it's just as bad as you thought.
[4059.28 → 4059.82] Maybe worse.
[4060.12 → 4060.46] Yeah.
[4060.46 → 4062.20] It's so bad.
[4062.30 → 4062.90] It's terrifying.
[4063.18 → 4065.10] It's the amount of like,
[4065.16 → 4065.78] man,
[4066.70 → 4070.46] there's always the like utopian view of like,
[4070.50 → 4075.38] this will help us do less menial garbage work, and we'll,
[4075.48 → 4080.00] we'll free the common person and allow us to do artistic pursuits.
[4080.00 → 4082.86] Or there's the late stage capitalism view where it's like,
[4083.06 → 4085.24] it will create meaningless garbage work.
[4085.42 → 4085.96] How about,
[4086.10 → 4089.82] how about you scroll infinitely with the hand motion?
[4089.82 → 4093.62] That is addicted through just the sloppiest,
[4093.80 → 4098.12] the crappiest AI junk ever forever and see what happens.
[4098.98 → 4099.62] Like,
[4099.72 → 4101.04] that's not what I want.
[4101.10 → 4101.96] That's not interesting.
[4102.18 → 4102.78] And I,
[4102.78 → 4103.16] I,
[4103.16 → 4108.10] I feel like I knew this was coming and there is interesting stuff happening in this space.
[4108.10 → 4108.30] Oh,
[4108.30 → 4108.62] absolutely.
[4108.62 → 4109.52] It's just not this.
[4109.92 → 4112.40] And it's also not,
[4112.40 → 4113.60] um,
[4113.60 → 4114.62] what is it called?
[4115.12 → 4116.28] Open AI pulse.
[4117.36 → 4118.00] Oh boy.
[4118.18 → 4119.80] I think both of these were announced today.
[4119.82 → 4120.30] So I'm not,
[4120.40 → 4121.54] I'm not blaming the
[4121.64 → 4122.04] uh,
[4122.04 → 4123.04] the doc writing team.
[4123.10 → 4123.58] They are,
[4123.76 → 4124.18] they are new.
[4124.26 → 4124.36] No,
[4124.40 → 4125.00] this is not new.
[4125.06 → 4125.32] Okay.
[4125.40 → 4125.76] Either way.
[4126.36 → 4126.80] Um,
[4126.92 → 4127.18] all right,
[4127.18 → 4127.76] I'm on your screen.
[4128.06 → 4128.88] ChatGPT pulse.
[4129.00 → 4129.68] What is this now?
[4130.48 → 4131.34] ChatGPT pulse.
[4131.56 → 4132.48] It essentially,
[4132.98 → 4133.92] um,
[4134.50 → 4137.70] let's see if they say it out loud here.
[4138.20 → 4139.34] To reach your goals.
[4140.18 → 4140.58] Yeah.
[4141.46 → 4142.20] What does that mean?
[4142.70 → 4143.14] Uh,
[4143.16 → 4152.32] so you tell it like goals or like things that you want, and it will work on it in quotes,
[4152.32 → 4156.52] even when you're not like using it.
[4156.64 → 4157.60] What does that even mean?
[4157.60 → 4167.14] I think the thing that they would like you to think is that something like your badminton thing,
[4167.52 → 4168.20] when it was like,
[4168.26 → 4170.18] I'll go work on that and then get back to you.
[4170.26 → 4171.68] Is that it's going to do that?
[4171.76 → 4171.88] Oh,
[4171.90 → 4175.00] it'll like turn away on large tasks in the background or something.
[4176.00 → 4178.26] I think that might be what they would like you to think.
[4178.28 → 4179.26] I haven't read this whole thing.
[4179.30 → 4180.48] I'm just being honest.
[4180.76 → 4181.20] Um,
[4181.20 → 4182.66] so I might miss parts of it.
[4183.44 → 4183.84] Um,
[4183.98 → 4185.12] let's see if they show.
[4186.94 → 4187.82] When you're travelling,
[4187.96 → 4188.72] what is your preference?
[4189.02 → 4189.74] This helps us shape.
[4190.18 → 4190.58] It's more,
[4190.70 → 4191.64] one kind of experiences,
[4191.86 → 4191.98] blah,
[4192.04 → 4192.08] blah,
[4192.08 → 4192.36] blah.
[4192.80 → 4194.52] It'll research something for you.
[4194.60 → 4195.48] What is even?
[4196.64 → 4199.20] So I think there was like a Sam Altman tweet.
[4199.68 → 4200.18] Um,
[4200.18 → 4203.70] so basically they just want you to feed more personal data into it.
[4203.70 → 4205.48] Um,
[4205.52 → 4205.68] like,
[4205.70 → 4206.64] am I missing something here?
[4206.76 → 4213.96] The thing that I suspect other people are picking up on as well is this is almost certainly going to be an ad engine.
[4214.68 → 4215.12] Well,
[4215.20 → 4215.48] yeah.
[4215.62 → 4220.74] So they can find like a bunch of people that have certain desires and then sell ads against those desires.
[4220.74 → 4221.14] Right.
[4221.48 → 4221.78] Uh,
[4221.78 → 4224.98] that is like for sure what's going on.
[4225.04 → 4225.22] Right.
[4225.22 → 4229.72] So basically they just want some time to go sell it.
[4230.00 → 4230.48] Here we go.
[4230.48 → 4236.88] Between when you tell them that I'm interested in travelling and when it gives you a response.
[4237.78 → 4238.30] This,
[4238.44 → 4240.00] this part right here.
[4240.50 → 4241.80] Oh man.
[4243.50 → 4244.52] It performs super well.
[4244.56 → 4248.42] If you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you in regular chat,
[4248.50 → 4249.24] you could mention,
[4249.40 → 4251.28] I'd like to visit Bora Bora someday,
[4251.28 → 4254.96] or my kid is six months old, and I'm interested in developmental milestones.
[4254.96 → 4258.06] And in the future you might get useful updates.
[4258.42 → 4259.32] Also known as,
[4259.32 → 4260.18] to me,
[4260.50 → 4261.04] ads,
[4261.44 → 4262.10] ads,
[4262.10 → 4265.50] you might get useful ads in the future.
[4266.26 → 4266.82] Um,
[4266.82 → 4267.30] and you know,
[4267.38 → 4271.60] I'm sure they'll use it for other things first so that people feel really disarmed about it.
[4271.60 → 4272.80] And then later on,
[4272.80 → 4275.54] they'll just start trickling it in a little bit over time.
[4275.68 → 4275.88] I mean,
[4275.98 → 4278.48] Elon said that out loud when,
[4278.48 → 4279.06] uh,
[4279.16 → 4279.40] yeah.
[4279.80 → 4281.98] When Kroc got some update a little while ago.
[4282.20 → 4283.42] Handyman linked this.
[4283.76 → 4285.10] What fantastic timing.
[4287.10 → 4287.62] Nice.
[4291.14 → 4291.66] Yeah.
[4291.66 → 4292.18] So like,
[4292.24 → 4292.38] I,
[4292.38 → 4294.82] I'm like rather the second I read this,
[4294.86 → 4295.78] I was just like,
[4296.46 → 4296.98] Hmm,
[4297.34 → 4298.68] if it said,
[4298.80 → 4299.52] you know,
[4299.58 → 4301.80] I'd like to visit Bora Bora someday,
[4301.80 → 4305.70] you could say that to it, and it could definitely be helpful immediately.
[4305.98 → 4308.98] There is no reason for it to be helpful in the future.
[4309.10 → 4310.24] My kid is six months old.
[4310.30 → 4311.72] I'm interested in developmental milestones.
[4311.90 → 4314.36] It could definitely tell you some of those now,
[4314.50 → 4314.86] right now.
[4314.94 → 4318.38] There is no reason that it should wait and tell you them later,
[4318.38 → 4321.38] unless there's some product that it could advertise to you,
[4321.38 → 4322.88] potentially at a more,
[4323.18 → 4325.86] at a time that it thinks you might be more likely to buy it.
[4325.88 → 4329.16] Like if it realizes you're online at two in the morning or something,
[4329.16 → 4329.90] when people's,
[4330.00 → 4332.88] people's ability to resist buying things is a little bit lower,
[4333.22 → 4333.94] it'll hit you with it.
[4333.96 → 4335.50] Or if it knows your kid's six months old today,
[4335.50 → 4339.46] then it knows that your kid is two years old in 18 months.
[4340.02 → 4340.60] That's useful.
[4340.60 → 4342.06] Maybe you need this other product.
[4342.20 → 4343.86] Maybe you need shoes or maybe,
[4344.00 → 4344.18] yeah,
[4344.24 → 4344.50] whatever.
[4344.64 → 4344.78] Yeah,
[4344.78 → 4348.80] because giving it a desire does not mean that it is only going to attempt to
[4348.80 → 4350.16] fulfill that one desire.
[4350.16 → 4351.88] Cyber Cetacean says,
[4351.88 → 4356.06] it's like people watched WALL-E and thought it was something to aspire to
[4356.06 → 4357.06] rather than a warning.
[4357.42 → 4357.80] Yeah.
[4360.02 → 4363.30] Oh man.
[4364.60 → 4365.94] Ani Heroic says,
[4366.06 → 4367.08] and this is a perfect point,
[4367.22 → 4370.30] spreading out interactions with an app over time also makes it more addictive.
[4370.46 → 4371.98] So it's a Jedi mind trick as well.
[4373.12 → 4374.54] I added the Jedi part.
[4374.54 → 4377.08] That absolutely makes sense.
[4377.26 → 4378.34] It'll use it to draw you back in.
[4378.34 → 4378.98] You will tell me your desires.
[4381.76 → 4382.04] Brilliant.
[4383.10 → 4384.10] To see a fab.
[4385.18 → 4386.16] What are you going to do about it?
[4386.94 → 4387.48] I'm already going.
[4388.18 → 4388.50] Oh,
[4388.54 → 4389.34] are we talking about that?
[4389.50 → 4389.94] I don't know.
[4390.00 → 4391.12] I wasn't sure if it was a secret.
[4391.20 → 4391.88] Maybe not anymore.
[4392.86 → 4393.92] I didn't say which one.
[4394.06 → 4394.78] For crying out loud.
[4394.86 → 4395.50] I didn't say which one.
[4396.10 → 4396.32] Okay,
[4396.36 → 4396.46] well,
[4396.48 → 4397.74] he's going somewhere fabulous.
[4398.36 → 4398.54] Yeah.
[4398.54 → 4399.80] We'll leave it there next week.
[4403.18 → 4403.82] Frickin' guy.
[4404.00 → 4404.84] I didn't say which one.
[4405.42 → 4405.80] Okay.
[4406.14 → 4408.00] I just don't know if it's a secret or not.
[4408.30 → 4409.06] I don't know.
[4409.54 → 4409.94] Okay.
[4410.90 → 4413.08] I just like half assume that everything is.
[4415.56 → 4417.14] Why don't we talk about our sponsors?
[4417.78 → 4418.70] That's not a secret.
[4419.22 → 4421.08] The show is brought to you today by...
[4421.74 → 4422.08] Oh,
[4422.50 → 4423.58] are you good,
[4423.58 → 4423.90] Dan?
[4424.02 → 4424.18] Oh,
[4424.22 → 4424.72] he's awake.
[4425.22 → 4425.62] Yeah,
[4425.96 → 4426.52] he's awake.
[4427.02 → 4427.84] Float plane first.
[4428.54 → 4430.96] You're above the float plane.
[4431.16 → 4431.84] It's there,
[4431.94 → 4432.66] and what is in there
[4432.66 → 4433.50] is he's really yellow.
[4433.74 → 4436.00] He's still there.
[4437.34 → 4439.12] With Sammy away on vacation,
[4439.86 → 4441.78] Jake Bell of short circuit fame
[4441.78 → 4444.10] has commandeered the float plane exclusive helm
[4444.10 → 4445.98] and released two off-the-cuff videos
[4445.98 → 4447.16] walking around the office
[4447.16 → 4449.08] to get team reactions
[4449.08 → 4453.24] to the cursed Casio Colin AI pet
[4453.24 → 4455.92] and the iPhone Air.
[4456.26 → 4457.98] All you got to do to enjoy them
[4457.98 → 4458.96] is head over to
[4458.96 → 4460.34] leg.GG
[4460.34 → 4461.80] slash float plane
[4461.80 → 4465.12] to enjoy Bell's sultry vocals.
[4465.52 → 4465.94] Okay.
[4466.20 → 4467.86] That's a weird way of saying that.
[4468.06 → 4468.86] Dulcet tones.
[4469.14 → 4469.78] And also,
[4469.98 → 4471.32] our incredible team.
[4472.66 → 4474.60] Lagers react to iPhone Air.
[4475.38 → 4477.06] I hate this thing so much.
[4478.12 → 4479.74] Editors apparently argue about it.
[4479.74 → 4479.90] Oh,
[4479.96 → 4480.12] okay.
[4480.18 → 4480.32] Yeah,
[4480.38 → 4480.50] no,
[4480.54 → 4481.58] these seem pretty well received,
[4481.66 → 4482.04] so that's cool.
[4482.04 → 4482.40] Also,
[4482.76 → 4484.28] there's a new episode of
[4484.28 → 4485.42] We Have Fridays Off
[4485.42 → 4486.64] and Linus is still late.
[4486.72 → 4487.42] Why is Wan late?
[4487.76 → 4488.22] I don't think,
[4488.34 → 4488.48] well,
[4488.52 → 4489.92] I don't think I was late that time.
[4490.10 → 4490.72] What the heck?
[4491.02 → 4492.46] There was quite a few on times.
[4492.72 → 4493.08] Yeah.
[4493.30 → 4494.46] There have been a lot of on times.
[4494.46 → 4494.58] Yeah,
[4494.58 → 4495.90] because I was the only one
[4495.90 → 4496.76] who was actually,
[4496.94 → 4497.04] no,
[4497.10 → 4497.36] I'm not,
[4497.36 → 4498.44] I was the only one.
[4498.56 → 4499.26] There were other people
[4499.26 → 4501.18] working the Friday afternoon sometimes.
[4501.44 → 4501.60] Yeah.
[4501.80 → 4503.46] We had Scrapyard Wars going,
[4503.68 → 4506.16] so I know that Hoffman was often-
[4506.16 → 4506.90] He was definitely here.
[4506.98 → 4507.78] Working on stuff,
[4507.78 → 4510.64] and then David got kind of dunked on
[4510.64 → 4511.82] because we had the Chromebook video
[4511.82 → 4512.92] that we had to shoot together,
[4513.12 → 4515.08] and then he was also Scrapyard Warning.
[4515.26 → 4516.36] There's some labs people in there,
[4516.42 → 4517.24] some IT people in there.
[4517.24 → 4519.10] A lot of people had Fridays off
[4519.10 → 4521.94] for the latter part of the summer,
[4522.24 → 4523.48] just as kind of like,
[4523.86 → 4524.18] hey,
[4524.34 → 4525.66] wouldn't it be cool if Fridays were off?
[4525.90 → 4527.30] So it's amazing how easy it is
[4527.30 → 4528.62] for me to be on time for WAN show
[4528.62 → 4530.10] when nobody's bothering me
[4530.10 → 4531.20] because I was just sitting
[4531.20 → 4532.06] in my office working.
[4532.16 → 4532.30] I'm like,
[4532.34 → 4532.44] oh,
[4532.46 → 4533.08] it's time for WAN show,
[4533.12 → 4534.08] and then I just go to WAN show.
[4534.22 → 4534.42] Yeah.
[4534.94 → 4535.28] It's,
[4535.34 → 4536.60] seriously,
[4537.20 → 4538.20] I'm not going to claim
[4538.20 → 4539.36] to be a punctual person.
[4539.92 → 4540.28] That would be a lie.
[4540.28 → 4540.86] You were on time
[4540.86 → 4543.02] like every one of those days.
[4543.08 → 4544.56] But a big part of my challenge
[4544.56 → 4545.62] in being punctual
[4545.62 → 4547.70] is external factors.
[4547.70 → 4548.10] Yeah.
[4548.32 → 4548.54] Yeah,
[4548.54 → 4548.74] yeah,
[4548.74 → 4548.90] yeah.
[4548.94 → 4550.16] Both Luke and I know this,
[4550.24 → 4551.02] and we're fine with it.
[4551.10 → 4551.50] Yeah,
[4551.62 → 4551.96] well,
[4552.10 → 4553.32] I do my best.
[4553.52 → 4554.32] I do my best.
[4555.08 → 4556.60] The show is brought to you by,
[4556.60 → 4557.60] Corsair.
[4558.24 → 4559.18] You know what all these
[4559.18 → 4559.96] setups here are missing?
[4561.02 → 4562.02] More displays.
[4562.46 → 4563.80] But not just any display.
[4564.46 → 4565.64] A smaller display?
[4565.88 → 4566.16] Oh,
[4566.42 → 4566.76] cool.
[4567.04 → 4568.74] Like the Corsair Xenon Edge.
[4568.84 → 4569.58] These are cool.
[4569.58 → 4571.30] It's a 14 and a half inch
[4571.30 → 4572.24] touchscreen panel
[4572.24 → 4575.22] with a resolution of 2560 by 720
[4575.22 → 4577.08] and a 60 hertz refresh rate.
[4578.32 → 4579.08] What is that for?
[4579.14 → 4580.06] You could game on it,
[4580.14 → 4581.66] but it's not really meant for that.
[4582.16 → 4583.10] It's meant to be
[4583.10 → 4584.56] for showcasing system info,
[4585.06 → 4585.30] like,
[4585.30 → 4586.96] or like system metrics,
[4587.06 → 4588.00] or you could use it
[4588.00 → 4588.80] for chat channels
[4588.80 → 4589.88] or more.
[4590.38 → 4591.64] It's kind of up to you.
[4591.64 → 4592.26] Oh my God.
[4592.58 → 4593.72] It's kind of up to you.
[4593.80 → 4594.26] Sick.
[4594.54 → 4595.82] And with a bunch of magnetics,
[4595.92 → 4596.56] magnetics,
[4596.68 → 4597.98] and with a bunch of magnets
[4597.98 → 4599.34] and two integrated mounts,
[4599.52 → 4601.02] you can have it sitting on your desk
[4601.02 → 4602.64] or attached to a monitor arm
[4602.64 → 4605.78] or even live right inside your PC case.

[4606.80 → 4608.50] or pick one up for yourself today

[4609.68 → 4611.06] in the video description.
[4611.46 → 4612.82] I actually might buy one.
[4612.90 → 4613.42] Those are cool.
[4613.96 → 4614.44] That is cool.
[4614.50 → 4616.86] The show is also brought to you by Factor.

[4625.88 → 4628.00] you've got to go make dinner.

[4659.02 → 4659.78] have reported living
[4659.78 → 4660.50] a healthier life

[4683.66 → 4684.78] Finally, the show is brought to you
[4684.78 → 4686.10] by Rove Lab.
[4686.62 → 4687.90] If you just got the keys
[4687.90 → 4688.94] to your brand-new apartment,
[4689.30 → 4690.08] what's the first thing
[4690.08 → 4690.62] you're going to buy?
[4691.20 → 4691.86] Chances are,
[4692.22 → 4693.30] it's going to be a couch.
[4693.66 → 4694.56] But getting one in
[4694.56 → 4696.78] can be a bit of a pain.
[4697.24 → 4698.10] And the couch itself
[4698.10 → 4698.68] can be a pain.
[4699.06 → 4699.84] Ours was awful too.
[4701.14 → 4702.50] Enter Rove Lab
[4702.50 → 4703.92] with their modular furniture.
[4704.50 → 4705.16] They come back,
[4705.42 → 4706.60] they come packed in boxes
[4706.60 → 4707.34] that are small
[4707.34 → 4708.26] and light enough
[4708.26 → 4709.42] to lug up multiple floors
[4709.42 → 4709.94] on your own.
[4710.32 → 4710.98] And all you got to do
[4710.98 → 4712.24] is unpack for everything,
[4712.68 → 4713.88] wait for it to take shape,
[4713.88 → 4714.80] and your living room
[4714.80 → 4715.68] will be couched up
[4715.68 → 4716.98] in no time.
[4717.36 → 4718.20] Plus, it's made with
[4718.20 → 4718.80] their patent-pending
[4718.80 → 4719.40] smartphone,
[4719.66 → 4720.14] which is designed
[4720.14 → 4721.22] to feel even more comfortable
[4721.22 → 4721.80] over time
[4721.80 → 4723.32] while remaining mess-resistant
[4723.32 → 4724.20] and easy to clean.
[4724.62 → 4725.38] They even come with
[4725.38 → 4727.22] a 100-day risk-free trial period
[4727.22 → 4728.52] and a limited lifetime warranty
[4728.52 → 4729.46] for peace of mind.
[4729.88 → 4730.44] So head over to
[4730.44 → 4732.24] rovelab.com slash WAN
[4732.24 → 4733.86] to get an Non-exclusive
[4733.86 → 4735.04] $100 discount
[4735.04 → 4736.80] that stacks on top
[4736.80 → 4738.24] of any other sales.
[4738.82 → 4739.52] But act fast
[4739.52 → 4740.24] because the software
[4740.24 → 4741.20] is only active
[4741.20 → 4743.48] for the next 72 hours.
[4744.34 → 4745.56] We've actually got a bunch
[4745.56 → 4746.72] of Rove Lab stuff
[4746.72 → 4747.86] over at Welling.
[4748.16 → 4748.40] Huh.
[4748.52 → 4751.34] So I've got a 5v5
[4751.34 → 4754.08] 120-inch tape-to-tape setup.
[4754.44 → 4754.70] Nice.
[4754.70 → 4755.62] Because of course I do.
[4755.70 → 4756.06] Nice.
[4756.18 → 4757.12] And we've got a bunch of...
[4757.12 → 4758.40] Because the couches are modular.
[4758.84 → 4760.22] So you can buy
[4760.22 → 4761.08] as many middle sections
[4761.08 → 4761.88] It looks like tofu.
[4762.06 → 4763.18] of a couch as you want,
[4763.30 → 4764.32] and then they're just zippers.
[4764.44 → 4765.54] You just zip them together.
[4765.68 → 4766.28] Oh, that makes sense.
[4766.32 → 4767.04] And then they're together.
[4767.20 → 4767.46] Cool.
[4767.60 → 4769.14] So that they're not apart anymore.
[4769.92 → 4770.66] It's pretty cool.
[4771.12 → 4771.44] Nice.
[4772.50 → 4772.92] All right.
[4773.16 → 4773.96] What else we got?
[4774.66 → 4775.14] Uh,
[4776.48 → 4776.82] topics?
[4776.82 → 4778.30] Oh, DJ the creator asked,
[4778.38 → 4779.30] are they too close to the ground?
[4779.58 → 4781.02] They are close to the ground.
[4782.64 → 4783.04] Um,
[4783.48 → 4784.62] whether you're into that or not,
[4784.96 → 4785.64] that's up to you.
[4785.76 → 4786.46] I will say,
[4786.56 → 4786.98] at Welling,
[4787.02 → 4787.76] it's very convenient
[4787.76 → 4788.64] because it means that
[4788.64 → 4789.04] I don't have to have
[4789.04 → 4790.00] the projector up really high.
[4790.26 → 4790.66] So...
[4790.66 → 4792.76] Because I don't have a way
[4792.76 → 4793.28] to do that.
[4793.56 → 4793.82] Yeah.
[4795.10 → 4795.46] Um,
[4795.94 → 4796.74] what do you want to do next?
[4797.48 → 4798.86] Low WAN views solved.
[4799.16 → 4799.68] What is this?
[4799.96 → 4800.32] Yeah,
[4800.32 → 4801.44] let's talk about that.
[4801.44 → 4803.82] Oh,
[4804.32 → 4805.10] this.
[4806.92 → 4807.42] Redditor
[4807.42 → 4808.64] Elena
[4808.64 → 4810.64] shared a surefire solution
[4810.64 → 4812.56] for low WAN viewership.
[4814.40 → 4815.94] We just need to do...
[4815.94 → 4816.48] Oh, come on.
[4817.42 → 4818.32] We just need to
[4818.32 → 4819.78] look more like this.
[4819.96 → 4821.14] Which we can do
[4821.14 → 4822.32] like this.
[4822.80 → 4824.16] Why were you looking here?
[4824.30 → 4824.82] Look here.
[4824.82 → 4827.10] I think this is not real time.
[4827.28 → 4828.52] I'm pretty sure
[4828.52 → 4829.32] it's not real time.
[4830.28 → 4830.88] Um...
[4830.88 → 4831.18] I mean,
[4831.20 → 4832.02] it wouldn't need to be
[4832.02 → 4833.18] completely real time.
[4834.42 → 4834.98] I mean,
[4835.02 → 4835.52] we're already like
[4835.52 → 4836.62] 300 milliseconds late.
[4836.62 → 4838.36] This is WAN 2.2.
[4838.50 → 4839.24] Funny enough,
[4839.36 → 4840.00] it's called WAN.
[4840.20 → 4841.90] This is WAN 2.2 Animate,
[4842.02 → 4842.58] I think.
[4842.90 → 4843.94] And I don't think
[4843.94 → 4844.86] that's real time.
[4844.96 → 4845.56] Am I wrong?
[4845.56 → 4845.76] I've been playing with that.
[4845.76 → 4846.84] I don't know a ton about this.
[4847.06 → 4847.42] I mean,
[4847.70 → 4848.22] it might be.
[4848.22 → 4848.80] Honey man says,
[4848.86 → 4849.08] yeah.
[4849.80 → 4850.20] Is it?
[4850.20 → 4850.70] It might be.
[4850.88 → 4852.22] I thought WAN only did
[4852.22 → 4853.00] five seconds.
[4853.34 → 4854.76] Not like WAN shows live.
[4855.66 → 4856.56] We could...
[4856.56 → 4857.70] Five seconds would be fine.
[4857.90 → 4858.04] Yeah,
[4858.08 → 4858.62] but I mean like
[4858.62 → 4860.14] we could easily have a delay
[4860.14 → 4860.80] and that's it.
[4861.04 → 4861.74] Like streamers...
[4861.74 → 4862.78] And then you have to render that.
[4862.98 → 4864.22] Like it's trained on five seconds.
[4864.52 → 4864.92] Oh,
[4864.92 → 4865.40] got it.
[4865.46 → 4865.70] Okay.
[4866.02 → 4866.88] I don't believe it's live.
[4867.04 → 4867.78] Isn't that video
[4867.78 → 4868.86] more than five seconds?
[4869.78 → 4870.60] I think so.
[4870.60 → 4872.40] Like character replacement
[4872.40 → 4873.12] has been a thing
[4873.12 → 4874.26] for like long time.
[4874.26 → 4874.38] Yeah,
[4874.48 → 4874.72] yeah,
[4874.72 → 4874.96] yeah,
[4874.96 → 4875.14] yeah,
[4875.14 → 4875.28] yeah.
[4875.28 → 4875.62] Anyway,
[4875.82 → 4876.72] the brilliant plan
[4876.72 → 4877.80] is to turn everyone
[4877.80 → 4878.74] on WAN into
[4878.74 → 4880.78] photorealistic AI thirst traps.
[4881.10 → 4882.00] Turn everyone on?
[4882.14 → 4882.58] Personally,
[4882.78 → 4884.32] I think it's a great idea.
[4885.74 → 4887.26] Great Yuzuki posted
[4887.26 → 4888.58] a handy comparison
[4888.58 → 4890.02] of face swapping tools.
[4891.04 → 4891.60] There we go.
[4892.50 → 4893.34] Got it.
[4893.34 → 4894.38] So,
[4895.02 → 4895.94] pricing model,
[4896.06 → 4896.46] subscription,
[4896.90 → 4897.78] $19 a month,
[4897.88 → 4898.42] web-based,
[4898.54 → 4899.30] private generation.
[4900.66 → 4901.60] Oh boy.
[4901.76 → 4902.16] You know what?
[4902.20 → 4903.72] Let's navigate away from that.
[4904.24 → 4904.72] We should...
[4904.72 → 4905.18] I don't...
[4905.18 → 4905.74] I didn't see it.
[4905.74 → 4906.02] Yeah,
[4906.06 → 4906.88] don't worry about it.
[4906.88 → 4908.88] We should do...
[4910.22 → 4911.82] We should take pictures of us
[4911.82 → 4912.88] from like...
[4914.14 → 4915.16] Or videos or whatever.
[4915.34 → 4915.86] We have both.
[4916.48 → 4917.14] I don't know.
[4917.30 → 4918.04] 10 years ago?
[4919.32 → 4920.84] And just do that.
[4920.96 → 4921.86] So it's still us.
[4921.96 → 4922.22] Also,
[4922.32 → 4923.94] apparently this is possibly fake
[4923.94 → 4925.54] because there appears to be
[4925.54 → 4926.40] real motion blur.
[4927.48 → 4928.78] So they might have just,
[4929.08 → 4929.68] you know,
[4930.02 → 4930.86] staged that.
[4931.48 → 4932.40] Either way,
[4932.54 → 4932.78] I have...
[4932.78 → 4933.44] It's pretty mimicable.
[4933.60 → 4934.88] I have seen some very,
[4935.88 → 4936.72] very...
[4936.72 → 4937.52] There are crazy ones.
[4937.78 → 4939.56] There's absolutely wild ones.
[4939.74 → 4940.46] Like where they're...
[4940.46 → 4941.64] Where the software like
[4941.64 → 4942.64] drops for a second
[4942.64 → 4944.04] and then like goes back up
[4944.04 → 4946.04] and they're actual streamers.
[4947.56 → 4948.00] Luke,
[4948.06 → 4948.96] didn't you send me a video
[4948.96 → 4949.90] ages ago about like
[4949.90 → 4950.88] the webcam one?
[4951.14 → 4952.44] It was like a real-time thing.
[4953.04 → 4954.62] The guy was sitting at his desk
[4954.62 → 4956.32] and wasn't actually sitting there,
[4956.38 → 4956.88] but it was him.
[4957.68 → 4959.16] Insomniac says that it's a
[4959.16 → 4960.68] fork of face rig,
[4960.86 → 4961.32] apparently.
[4962.52 → 4964.14] Real-time manipulation.
[4964.72 → 4964.90] Who knows?
[4964.90 → 4965.96] So it's just like Tuber
[4965.96 → 4967.10] at that point.
[4967.42 → 4967.62] Yep.
[4968.22 → 4968.44] Yeah.
[4968.56 → 4969.40] Pretty wild, man.
[4970.76 → 4971.12] Anyway,
[4971.34 → 4972.26] I just thought it was...
[4972.26 → 4973.52] I basically thought it was funny.
[4973.70 → 4974.52] So that was it.
[4975.12 → 4975.26] Yeah.
[4975.60 → 4976.04] Oh man,
[4976.08 → 4977.30] why is everything AI news?
[4977.34 → 4978.10] Let's find something else.
[4978.34 → 4979.28] Oh, this is fun.
[4979.38 → 4979.78] Okay.
[4980.64 → 4981.02] Man,
[4982.06 → 4982.98] we're going to talk about
[4982.98 → 4983.94] the Chevy Volt again.
[4984.74 → 4985.20] Nice.
[4985.34 → 4986.72] Because the Chevy Volt
[4986.72 → 4988.56] is a practical car
[4988.56 → 4989.72] for cool,
[4989.86 → 4990.66] practical people.
[4990.66 → 4993.70] and I was always frustrated
[4993.70 → 4995.92] back when I got mine
[4995.92 → 4997.50] and back when I did my video
[4997.50 → 4999.84] and back when I talked about that car,
[5000.16 → 5001.78] how people just didn't seem to get it.
[5002.00 → 5003.24] They didn't seem to get
[5003.24 → 5005.32] plug-in hybrid vehicles
[5005.32 → 5006.74] and how they were just like
[5006.74 → 5007.76] this incredible,
[5008.04 → 5008.68] like,
[5009.16 → 5010.14] perfect marriage
[5010.14 → 5011.96] of the best things about an EV
[5011.96 → 5014.20] and the best things about a gas car
[5014.20 → 5015.14] with,
[5015.48 → 5015.94] admittedly,
[5016.06 → 5017.76] some of the downsides of both as well,
[5017.76 → 5020.02] but really the best of both
[5020.02 → 5021.46] because you get the...
[5021.46 → 5021.82] I want one.
[5021.92 → 5022.92] You get the economics
[5022.92 → 5024.48] of building them
[5024.48 → 5025.80] because you don't have to fill them
[5025.80 → 5026.64] with all the fuel
[5026.64 → 5027.90] they will ever need forever.
[5028.24 → 5030.18] You just put a small battery in them
[5030.18 → 5031.26] that realistically covers
[5031.26 → 5032.56] most of your daily commuting.
[5034.38 → 5036.54] And you get the benefits of a gas car
[5036.54 → 5038.18] in that if you are going somewhere far,
[5038.38 → 5040.40] you just put gas in it
[5040.40 → 5041.28] and go.
[5041.46 → 5043.34] You don't have to think about range anxiety.
[5043.72 → 5045.46] So I did most of my driving
[5045.46 → 5047.34] on full electric with that car.
[5047.76 → 5049.02] I'd fill up the gas tank
[5049.02 → 5049.60] freaking like,
[5049.98 → 5050.42] I don't know,
[5050.48 → 5051.90] once every four to eight weeks
[5051.90 → 5052.70] or something like that.
[5052.74 → 5052.86] Like,
[5052.92 → 5054.18] I hardly used gas
[5054.18 → 5056.16] and it was awesome.
[5056.78 → 5058.60] And I was shocked
[5058.60 → 5060.78] when I talked to a guy
[5060.78 → 5062.30] who worked at the Chevy dealer
[5062.30 → 5063.16] who was like,
[5063.20 → 5063.32] yeah,
[5063.32 → 5064.50] I had a guy trade one in
[5064.50 → 5065.12] who literally,
[5065.12 → 5065.48] like,
[5065.54 → 5066.36] didn't even realize
[5066.36 → 5067.98] that you had to plug it in.
[5068.30 → 5068.80] And that just,
[5068.98 → 5069.86] it just blew me away.
[5069.98 → 5071.44] And it was a super efficient
[5071.44 → 5072.22] gas-powered vehicle.
[5072.40 → 5073.86] It's one of the most unfortunate things,
[5074.32 → 5075.20] things with automotive
[5075.20 → 5077.42] that I've been paying attention
[5077.42 → 5078.14] to automotive for
[5078.14 → 5080.58] because hybrids came out first
[5080.58 → 5082.08] and then plug-in hybrids
[5082.08 → 5082.64] came out after
[5082.64 → 5083.58] and people had no idea
[5083.58 → 5084.14] what it was.
[5084.24 → 5085.20] They just didn't understand it.
[5085.28 → 5086.40] It was the Wii to Wii U thing.
[5086.70 → 5086.94] Yeah.
[5087.08 → 5088.12] It basically happened,
[5088.26 → 5089.06] but with cars.
[5089.46 → 5091.70] So Buddy just drove his Volt
[5091.70 → 5092.66] for years
[5092.66 → 5094.84] and never plugged it in once.
[5095.14 → 5095.42] Yeah.
[5095.58 → 5097.30] Which is not the end of the world
[5097.30 → 5097.80] because,
[5097.94 → 5098.76] because it doesn't have
[5098.76 → 5100.20] a super heavy battery in it.
[5100.20 → 5102.64] It's still a super efficient gas vehicle,
[5102.84 → 5103.60] but like,
[5103.68 → 5104.38] oh my God,
[5104.38 → 5105.40] if you just plugged it in
[5105.40 → 5106.80] to your garage every night,
[5106.98 → 5109.14] you'd save a flipping fortune
[5109.14 → 5110.12] living here in BC
[5110.12 → 5112.14] where electricity is so cheap.
[5112.14 → 5112.90] It's very cheap here.
[5113.94 → 5114.38] Anyway,
[5114.82 → 5116.32] Toyota came across
[5116.32 → 5117.68] this same
[5117.68 → 5121.54] unsettling piece of information
[5121.54 → 5124.22] that people are not charging
[5124.22 → 5126.50] their plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.
[5126.80 → 5128.00] And they came up
[5128.00 → 5129.88] with the Charge Minder app.
[5130.32 → 5131.82] They're going to gamify it.
[5132.34 → 5133.96] It delivers push notifications
[5133.96 → 5134.86] at key moments,
[5135.04 → 5136.36] like when you arrive at home
[5136.36 → 5138.82] or other user-defined charging places.
[5139.38 → 5140.74] These notifications apparently
[5140.74 → 5142.92] increased charging by 10%
[5142.92 → 5144.28] compared to a control group.
[5144.70 → 5146.64] They also increased driver satisfaction
[5146.64 → 5148.16] by 16 percentage points
[5148.16 → 5148.86] because,
[5149.46 → 5149.80] duh,
[5150.72 → 5152.32] who wouldn't be satisfied
[5152.32 → 5154.40] by driving for cheaper
[5154.40 → 5155.28] a lot of the time?
[5155.56 → 5155.64] Yeah.
[5156.30 → 5157.46] The gamification aspect
[5157.46 → 5158.88] includes positive reinforcement,
[5159.18 → 5160.52] like attaining charging streaks
[5160.52 → 5162.80] and charging habit summaries.
[5163.32 → 5164.34] You know what they should...
[5164.34 → 5167.46] Our discussion question here is,
[5167.78 → 5169.60] plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
[5169.60 → 5170.88] cost thousands of dollars
[5170.88 → 5172.40] more than regular hybrid cars.
[5172.72 → 5174.42] If people aren't buying them,
[5174.84 → 5176.08] or if people aren't plugging them in,
[5176.22 → 5177.72] why are they spending the extra money?
[5179.30 → 5180.74] And then this is from Nick Proof.
[5181.16 → 5181.52] He goes,
[5181.52 → 5182.92] I paid extra for Prime,
[5183.06 → 5183.66] for a Prime,
[5183.88 → 5185.38] not Amazon Prime,
[5185.48 → 5186.44] for a Toyota Prime,
[5186.72 → 5188.86] because I can plug it in.
[5189.04 → 5189.20] Yeah.
[5189.54 → 5189.94] Yes,
[5189.98 → 5191.10] that's because you
[5191.10 → 5192.44] are a smart person
[5192.44 → 5193.52] who owns a display.
[5194.88 → 5195.32] Allegedly.
[5195.58 → 5195.98] Allegedly.
[5196.20 → 5196.50] Allegedly.
[5196.98 → 5197.38] Allegedly.
[5198.32 → 5199.82] They're not going to watch this anyway.
[5199.82 → 5200.76] I'll just say it.
[5200.82 → 5202.32] I think there are ways
[5202.32 → 5203.08] that they could probably
[5203.08 → 5203.86] end up making money
[5203.86 → 5204.68] off this as well.
[5206.26 → 5207.34] What's wrong with you?
[5207.54 → 5208.22] Shut up, Luke.
[5208.40 → 5209.38] Yeah, shut up, Luke.
[5209.82 → 5211.24] They're not going to listen to this.
[5211.70 → 5212.46] It's fine.
[5213.34 → 5214.98] But they could see
[5214.98 → 5216.38] the places that you're plugging in
[5216.38 → 5217.38] that aren't at home.
[5220.08 → 5221.46] Oh, that's been smart.
[5221.98 → 5222.66] Stop talking.
[5223.44 → 5224.44] Yeah, sounds good.
[5226.42 → 5227.28] Next topic.
[5229.46 → 5230.38] Spam GPT.
[5230.54 → 5231.50] I don't think we can get away.
[5231.60 → 5232.56] They're all AI topics.
[5232.56 → 5233.68] Let's do Spam GPT.
[5233.86 → 5234.52] Uh, okay.
[5234.56 → 5235.70] They're not all AI topics,
[5235.84 → 5237.18] but yeah, we'll do this one first.
[5237.26 → 5237.56] Hit me.
[5238.00 → 5239.30] Spam GPT is a new
[5239.30 → 5240.80] AI-powered email attack
[5240.80 → 5241.60] automation kit
[5241.60 → 5242.66] being found on
[5242.66 → 5243.56] people are mad.
[5244.30 → 5245.22] Being found on
[5245.22 → 5246.14] underground forums
[5246.14 → 5247.32] and the dark web.
[5248.40 → 5250.84] In a blog posted earlier this month,
[5250.94 → 5252.18] cybersecurity firm
[5252.18 → 5254.48] Barons calls Spam GPT
[5254.48 → 5256.42] an enterprise marketing platform
[5256.42 → 5257.88] weaponized for spam
[5257.88 → 5258.90] and says,
[5259.08 → 5259.96] what used to require
[5259.96 → 5261.32] a team of skilled developers
[5261.32 → 5262.38] can now be accomplished
[5262.38 → 5263.68] by a single bad actor
[5263.68 → 5265.50] with a $5,000 toolkit.
[5266.28 → 5266.98] And it's
[5266.98 → 5268.32] Spam as a Service,
[5268.50 → 5269.52] which I would kind of hope for
[5269.52 → 5270.52] considering its name.
[5270.90 → 5271.18] Uh,
[5271.18 → 5272.60] the platform enables attackers
[5272.60 → 5273.26] to design,
[5273.46 → 5273.72] schedule,
[5273.80 → 5274.22] and monitor
[5274.22 → 5275.34] large-scale spam
[5275.34 → 5276.34] and phishing operations
[5276.34 → 5278.50] with minimal technical expertise.
[5278.88 → 5279.86] Spam GPT offers
[5279.86 → 5280.94] a straightforward GUI
[5280.94 → 5282.62] and detailed documentation
[5282.62 → 5283.62] and incorporates
[5283.62 → 5284.64] generative AI
[5284.64 → 5285.80] to create convincing
[5285.80 → 5286.88] spam campaigns.
[5286.88 → 5288.48] tutorials,
[5288.48 → 5288.64] tutorials,
[5289.00 → 5289.78] teach users,
[5290.18 → 5291.70] SMTP cracking mastery,
[5291.70 → 5292.56] and techniques
[5292.56 → 5293.30] for spoofing
[5293.30 → 5294.16] trusted brands
[5294.16 → 5294.92] and domains.
[5295.34 → 5296.48] Spam GPT engineers
[5296.48 → 5297.70] bulk email
[5297.70 → 5298.92] to slip through
[5298.92 → 5299.74] spam filters
[5299.74 → 5301.76] and land in your inbox.
[5301.76 → 5302.56] Which honestly
[5302.56 → 5303.86] kind of makes me
[5303.86 → 5304.46] want to buy it
[5304.46 → 5306.32] because we have trouble
[5306.32 → 5308.66] with that sometimes
[5308.66 → 5309.26] and we're sending
[5309.26 → 5310.28] legitimate email.
[5310.44 → 5310.82] It's like,
[5311.12 → 5312.04] if the
[5312.10 → 5313.20] if the bad actors
[5313.20 → 5314.52] can figure it out,
[5314.52 → 5316.08] why am I getting gated?
[5316.78 → 5317.16] Anyway,
[5317.34 → 5317.84] carry on.
[5318.24 → 5318.44] By,
[5318.52 → 5319.76] by combining these features
[5319.76 → 5320.88] with campaign analytics,
[5321.10 → 5322.10] oh my god.
[5322.68 → 5323.26] Spam GPT.
[5323.26 → 5323.64] Isn't this,
[5323.70 → 5324.28] is this scary or what?
[5324.28 → 5325.64] This is actually wild.
[5325.98 → 5327.04] It's Mailchimp.
[5327.34 → 5327.58] The
[5327.58 → 5328.46] the funny thing is,
[5328.56 → 5328.58] but for like,
[5328.58 → 5329.38] né'er-do-wells.
[5329.40 → 5330.00] The funny thing is
[5330.00 → 5330.58] because it's a
[5330.84 → 5332.22] I'm assuming it seems
[5332.22 → 5333.08] like it's a one-time
[5333.08 → 5333.96] payment of $5,000.
[5334.30 → 5335.28] This might be
[5335.28 → 5337.26] just a cheaper way
[5337.26 → 5338.52] for people to get like
[5338.52 → 5339.72] ad campaign management
[5339.72 → 5340.86] because the
[5340.86 → 5341.16] the
[5341.16 → 5341.80] the multi,
[5342.34 → 5344.30] just terrible ideas
[5344.30 → 5344.60] today.
[5344.62 → 5345.16] Oh my god.
[5345.46 → 5346.78] The multi-user subscription
[5346.78 → 5348.10] model that a lot of
[5348.10 → 5349.24] these platforms run on
[5349.24 → 5350.48] is really expensive
[5350.48 → 5351.52] and really annoying.
[5351.92 → 5352.68] So if it is just
[5352.68 → 5353.76] a one-time buy,
[5354.20 → 5355.40] it might be a pretty
[5355.40 → 5356.34] attractive option
[5356.34 → 5357.52] for like legitimate,
[5357.94 → 5359.46] this is the worst
[5359.46 → 5360.94] timeline ever.
[5362.12 → 5362.56] Ah,
[5363.14 → 5363.66] anyway,
[5364.02 → 5364.72] okay.
[5365.08 → 5365.64] Someone's gonna,
[5365.78 → 5366.72] someone's going to buy it
[5366.72 → 5367.52] and repackage it
[5367.52 → 5368.32] as like a
[5368.32 → 5369.38] legit thing.
[5369.38 → 5369.64] Yeah.
[5370.90 → 5372.24] I'm messaging Conrad
[5372.24 → 5372.92] right now.
[5373.16 → 5373.74] This is going to pay
[5373.74 → 5374.10] the bills,
[5374.22 → 5374.42] baby.
[5374.66 → 5375.14] Yeah,
[5375.18 → 5375.90] let's go.
[5376.22 → 5377.40] Keep the lights on
[5377.40 → 5378.70] with spam,
[5379.24 → 5379.38] with,
[5379.46 → 5379.80] with,
[5379.80 → 5380.48] with legitimate
[5380.48 → 5381.86] marketing activities.
[5382.04 → 5382.34] Yes.
[5382.94 → 5383.78] Based on your
[5383.78 → 5384.04] chat,
[5384.04 → 5385.64] ChatGPT history.
[5385.96 → 5386.24] All right.
[5386.30 → 5387.14] By combining these
[5387.14 → 5388.20] features with campaign
[5388.20 → 5388.60] analytics,
[5388.78 → 5389.58] spam GPT offers
[5389.58 → 5390.72] everything you'd find
[5390.72 → 5391.18] in a legitimate
[5391.18 → 5391.96] marketing CRM.
[5392.04 → 5392.50] This is my point.
[5392.50 → 5392.76] I know,
[5392.82 → 5393.32] that's what I was
[5393.32 → 5394.22] talking about before.
[5394.36 → 5395.66] But explicitly designed
[5395.66 → 5396.72] for malicious use.
[5397.20 → 5398.08] Domain owners are
[5398.08 → 5399.04] advertised to strengthen
[5399.04 → 5400.20] email authentication
[5400.20 → 5401.02] with DMARC,
[5401.12 → 5401.42] cool,
[5401.58 → 5402.18] SPF.
[5402.56 → 5404.40] There are big groups
[5404.40 → 5405.02] that don't have
[5405.02 → 5405.60] things like this
[5405.60 → 5405.92] running.
[5406.32 → 5408.28] And DKM to prevent
[5408.28 → 5409.42] spoofed domains
[5409.42 → 5410.70] and to deploy AI-powered
[5410.70 → 5411.52] tools to detect
[5411.52 → 5412.34] phishing emails
[5412.34 → 5413.72] generated by large
[5413.72 → 5414.52] language models.
[5416.72 → 5417.16] Oof.
[5417.60 → 5418.48] Another more
[5418.48 → 5419.80] different spam GPT
[5419.80 → 5421.22] is a set of
[5421.22 → 5422.20] Python scripts
[5422.20 → 5422.96] created by
[5422.96 → 5425.12] GitHub user
[5425.12 → 5426.52] Stars
[5426.52 → 5427.74] Stars
[5427.74 → 5429.52] Korokithakis.
[5430.08 → 5430.66] Hopefully that was
[5430.66 → 5431.18] pretty all right.
[5431.78 → 5432.82] This spam GPT
[5432.82 → 5433.62] uses,
[5433.90 → 5434.38] sorry,
[5434.68 → 5435.72] this spam GPT
[5435.72 → 5436.44] uses
[5436.44 → 5437.86] ChatGPT
[5437.86 → 5438.50] to send
[5438.50 → 5439.46] realistic replies
[5439.46 → 5440.76] to spam emails
[5440.76 → 5442.60] wasting as much
[5442.60 → 5443.58] of the scammer's
[5443.58 → 5444.54] time as possible
[5444.54 → 5446.12] by playing along
[5446.12 → 5446.66] and pretending
[5446.66 → 5447.42] to do whatever
[5447.42 → 5448.14] the scammer is
[5448.14 → 5448.86] asking for
[5448.86 → 5449.90] while insisting
[5449.90 → 5450.76] that any problems
[5450.76 → 5451.76] are on the scammer's
[5451.76 → 5452.06] side.
[5452.62 → 5453.82] Oh my god.
[5453.82 → 5455.48] Stars commented
[5455.48 → 5456.46] on Hacker News
[5456.46 → 5457.90] saying it was a bit
[5457.90 → 5458.76] of fun until I
[5458.76 → 5459.62] realized that most
[5459.62 → 5461.06] of the replied,
[5462.00 → 5462.98] most of the replies
[5462.98 → 5463.90] for the spammers
[5463.90 → 5465.50] were AI as well.
[5466.40 → 5466.92] Oh.
[5468.10 → 5469.34] So we were just
[5469.34 → 5470.70] automatically spamming
[5470.70 → 5471.60] each other while
[5471.60 → 5472.76] OpenAI made money.
[5473.12 → 5474.34] I stopped using it.
[5476.90 → 5477.50] That's,
[5477.62 → 5479.48] makes so much sense
[5479.48 → 5480.82] and is like for sure
[5480.82 → 5481.74] true and real.
[5482.62 → 5483.10] What is it,
[5483.10 → 5484.02] dead internet theory?
[5484.26 → 5484.50] Yeah.
[5484.64 → 5484.94] Like,
[5485.42 → 5486.24] it's just bots
[5486.24 → 5487.18] talking to bots.
[5487.20 → 5487.48] I mean,
[5487.56 → 5489.02] it is actually just
[5489.02 → 5489.50] a
[5489.68 → 5490.24] dead internet theory
[5490.24 → 5491.18] is just like real
[5491.18 → 5492.10] to a certain degree.
[5492.20 → 5493.14] Like there is an
[5493.14 → 5493.98] incredible amount
[5493.98 → 5494.88] of just bot traffic
[5494.88 → 5495.36] these days.
[5495.82 → 5496.30] Obviously,
[5496.50 → 5497.36] there's also
[5497.36 → 5499.18] like a
[5499.18 → 5500.52] never seen before
[5500.52 → 5501.46] percentage of the world
[5501.46 → 5502.30] that is online
[5502.30 → 5504.26] and acting on the internet.
[5504.26 → 5504.70] Yes.
[5504.70 → 5505.76] But there is also
[5505.76 → 5507.04] such a rate
[5507.04 → 5508.56] of increasing levels
[5508.56 → 5509.30] of bot traffic
[5509.30 → 5510.30] that it's like
[5510.30 → 5510.76] the chance
[5510.76 → 5511.48] that what you're
[5511.48 → 5511.90] running into
[5511.90 → 5512.52] is bot traffic
[5512.52 → 5512.90] is actually
[5512.90 → 5513.64] incredibly high.
[5515.28 → 5515.94] This is great.
[5516.08 → 5516.74] Gilmore D in
[5516.74 → 5517.46] float plane chat
[5517.46 → 5518.08] says it's like
[5518.08 → 5518.88] two Furies
[5518.88 → 5519.58] just babbling
[5519.58 → 5520.40] at each other.
[5522.54 → 5523.28] Discussion question
[5523.28 → 5523.94] is direct human
[5523.94 → 5524.52] interaction with the
[5524.52 → 5525.20] internet dying?
[5525.58 → 5525.82] Yeah.
[5526.04 → 5526.28] Yeah.
[5526.28 → 5526.76] I think we can
[5526.76 → 5527.28] just move on.
[5527.36 → 5528.00] In a lot of ways.
[5528.26 → 5528.96] It really is.
[5529.70 → 5530.84] What should Linus
[5530.84 → 5531.98] ask Linus?
[5531.98 → 5533.36] Elijah posted a thread
[5533.36 → 5534.26] on the LTT Subreddit
[5534.26 → 5534.94] where you can submit
[5534.94 → 5535.82] questions for our
[5535.82 → 5536.76] upcoming collab
[5536.76 → 5538.22] with Linus Torvalds.
[5538.68 → 5539.64] Don't miss it.
[5539.72 → 5540.68] Now's a great opportunity
[5540.68 → 5541.68] for you to go post
[5541.68 → 5543.20] on there or upvote
[5543.20 → 5544.42] anything that you
[5544.42 → 5545.26] would like to see
[5545.26 → 5546.12] us discuss with him.
[5546.22 → 5547.08] There are no guarantees
[5547.08 → 5547.78] that we will get
[5547.78 → 5548.34] to everything
[5548.34 → 5549.78] but it could be
[5549.78 → 5550.52] some nice
[5550.52 → 5552.04] jumping off points
[5552.04 → 5552.86] for conversations
[5552.86 → 5554.62] with the OG
[5554.62 → 5555.84] tech Linus
[5555.84 → 5556.86] when he comes up
[5556.86 → 5557.68] here for our
[5557.68 → 5559.00] hopefully if nothing
[5559.00 → 5559.76] else goes wrong
[5559.76 → 5560.82] there will be
[5560.82 → 5561.54] no hard feelings
[5561.54 → 5562.14] if anything
[5562.14 → 5563.20] does come up
[5563.20 → 5564.72] but we seem to be
[5564.72 → 5565.68] as far as I can tell
[5565.68 → 5566.22] confirmed.
[5566.56 → 5567.62] I'm so excited.
[5569.66 → 5570.06] Yeah.
[5570.20 → 5572.06] So I forget
[5572.06 → 5572.56] where I was going
[5572.56 → 5572.88] with that.
[5572.94 → 5573.64] The point is
[5573.64 → 5574.88] I think it's happening.
[5575.02 → 5575.76] I hope it's happening.
[5576.16 → 5576.70] I'm pretty sure
[5576.70 → 5577.16] it's happening
[5577.16 → 5578.36] and if it does
[5578.36 → 5579.32] what do you want us
[5579.32 → 5580.16] to talk to him about?
[5581.40 → 5582.06] That was it.
[5582.12 → 5582.74] Just want to make sure
[5582.74 → 5583.72] people are aware
[5583.72 → 5585.34] and then do a little
[5585.34 → 5586.26] sort of
[5586.26 → 5587.66] kind of
[5587.66 → 5589.38] chat with you guys
[5589.38 → 5590.44] about Google messages.
[5590.44 → 5592.82] Google's messaging app
[5592.82 → 5593.36] the default
[5593.36 → 5594.02] you use a pixel
[5594.02 → 5594.28] right?
[5594.58 → 5595.96] So your SMS app
[5595.96 → 5598.00] can you think
[5598.00 → 5599.00] of another
[5599.00 → 5600.38] modern text
[5600.38 → 5601.62] communication platform
[5601.62 → 5603.04] other than Google messages
[5603.04 → 5603.88] I know where you're going
[5603.88 → 5605.12] that doesn't support
[5605.12 → 5605.92] f***ING
[5605.92 → 5607.36] cloud sync?
[5607.54 → 5608.20] Yeah that's where
[5608.20 → 5608.60] he's going.
[5611.12 → 5611.64] No.
[5612.54 → 5614.38] What is going on?
[5614.50 → 5614.94] It's honestly
[5614.94 → 5615.66] one of the few
[5615.66 → 5616.42] default apps
[5616.42 → 5617.06] that I feel like
[5617.06 → 5617.40] you like
[5617.40 → 5618.34] need to get
[5618.34 → 5619.12] something else for.
[5619.78 → 5620.86] Like it's wild
[5620.86 → 5621.32] to me.
[5621.42 → 5621.74] And it's
[5621.74 → 5622.50] it's interesting
[5622.50 → 5624.14] like how much
[5624.14 → 5624.72] further ahead
[5624.72 → 5625.60] it feels like
[5625.60 → 5626.46] iMessage is.
[5626.82 → 5627.14] Oh
[5627.14 → 5628.42] dude
[5628.42 → 5629.56] look
[5629.56 → 5631.18] when Apple people
[5631.18 → 5631.78] tell me
[5631.78 → 5632.72] yeah I use an iPhone
[5632.72 → 5633.32] because like
[5633.32 → 5634.38] iMessage is so great
[5634.38 → 5635.58] I roll my eyes
[5635.58 → 5636.60] because iMessage
[5636.60 → 5637.88] is nothing special.
[5638.84 → 5639.88] But if the only
[5639.88 → 5640.32] other thing
[5640.32 → 5641.14] they'd ever tried
[5641.14 → 5642.46] was Google messages
[5642.46 → 5643.58] then dang
[5643.58 → 5644.18] I get it.
[5644.18 → 5644.92] I can see
[5644.92 → 5645.54] why they would
[5645.54 → 5646.16] think that
[5646.16 → 5647.04] iMessage is
[5647.04 → 5648.12] God's gift
[5648.12 → 5648.72] to people
[5648.72 → 5650.76] who send messages
[5650.76 → 5651.64] on their phone
[5651.64 → 5654.00] because wow
[5654.00 → 5656.24] is Google messages
[5656.24 → 5657.64] like I just
[5657.64 → 5659.16] I hadn't
[5659.16 → 5660.44] tried to migrate
[5660.44 → 5661.22] text messages
[5661.22 → 5662.54] in a while
[5662.54 → 5663.92] because I was
[5663.92 → 5664.90] using my Note 9
[5664.90 → 5666.54] for a super long time
[5666.54 → 5667.52] and then I only
[5667.52 → 5668.40] recently started
[5668.40 → 5669.72] like switching
[5669.72 → 5670.82] phones a lot again
[5670.82 → 5672.72] and so on my
[5672.72 → 5674.04] Note and on my
[5674.04 → 5674.96] folds I was using
[5674.96 → 5675.82] Samsung's messages
[5675.82 → 5676.92] app which also I
[5676.92 → 5677.90] think actually has
[5677.90 → 5678.56] synchronization
[5678.56 → 5679.52] don't quote me on
[5679.52 → 5680.18] that I don't know
[5680.18 → 5680.92] how good the
[5680.92 → 5681.86] synchronization is on
[5681.86 → 5682.84] Samsung's but the
[5682.84 → 5683.68] point is that I used
[5683.68 → 5684.46] like an import
[5684.46 → 5685.32] wizard
[5685.32 → 5689.16] and so it wasn't
[5689.16 → 5689.80] really a problem
[5689.80 → 5690.64] until I started
[5690.64 → 5692.06] swapping between
[5692.06 → 5693.08] Google phones like
[5693.08 → 5693.80] the Pixel and
[5693.80 → 5694.76] Graphene OS and
[5694.76 → 5695.90] there was
[5695.90 → 5696.50] something else that I
[5696.50 → 5697.16] was I think it was a
[5697.16 → 5698.04] OnePlus I was using
[5698.04 → 5698.86] for a little while
[5698.86 → 5699.86] and I kind of went
[5699.86 → 5701.14] oh crap I'm like
[5701.14 → 5702.26] losing track of a lot
[5702.26 → 5703.58] of my SMS messages
[5703.58 → 5704.94] and it's not always
[5704.94 → 5705.84] convenient for me to
[5705.84 → 5707.10] completely migrate
[5707.10 → 5708.30] because I might have
[5708.30 → 5709.24] two-factor authentication
[5709.24 → 5711.54] or like the Unify
[5711.54 → 5713.00] identity app so that I
[5713.00 → 5714.22] have you know door
[5714.22 → 5715.84] access at Smash Champs
[5715.84 → 5716.42] or whatever else I
[5716.42 → 5717.24] might still have that on
[5717.24 → 5718.14] my on my secondary
[5718.14 → 5719.58] phone, or I might be
[5719.58 → 5720.36] using a phone for a
[5720.36 → 5721.12] little while knowing
[5721.12 → 5721.70] that I'm going to go
[5721.70 → 5722.58] back to my other one
[5722.58 → 5723.52] and the only way to
[5723.52 → 5725.06] migrate back is to
[5725.06 → 5726.18] wipe the original one
[5726.18 → 5726.94] and then do the full
[5726.94 → 5729.10] migration and it just
[5729.10 → 5730.04] kind of struck me I
[5730.04 → 5732.24] was like yeah I'm
[5732.24 → 5734.10] how the heck does
[5734.10 → 5734.70] this not have
[5734.70 → 5736.22] Cloud Safe literally
[5736.22 → 5737.74] Google that you're
[5737.74 → 5739.26] that's like the whole
[5739.26 → 5740.02] thing you're trying to
[5740.02 → 5741.08] sell me go to drive
[5741.08 → 5742.06] it's like Google one
[5742.06 → 5743.10] and Google Drive and
[5743.10 → 5744.72] like all this stuff and
[5744.72 → 5746.82] it's been especially
[5746.82 → 5748.68] inconvenient, so I still
[5748.68 → 5749.90] am not switched over
[5749.90 → 5752.82] to the iPhone air
[5752.82 → 5753.88] even though I'm trying
[5753.88 → 5755.88] to because Apple's
[5755.88 → 5757.78] migration also is
[5757.78 → 5760.42] broken oh seriously
[5760.42 → 5762.02] check this out I
[5762.02 → 5763.16] usually hear very good
[5763.16 → 5765.18] things okay because I've
[5765.18 → 5766.38] got an entire page of
[5766.38 → 5767.52] notes on my next I
[5767.52 → 5768.98] switch to Apple about
[5768.98 → 5769.84] what an absolute
[5769.84 → 5771.54] clusterfuck the
[5771.54 → 5772.88] migration process I
[5772.88 → 5774.58] have an idea for an
[5774.58 → 5775.92] a Linus I switched by
[5775.92 → 5777.10] the way oh really I
[5777.10 → 5777.48] don't know if you're
[5777.48 → 5779.28] going to like it, but I'll
[5779.28 → 5779.86] pitch it when we're
[5779.86 → 5782.20] done here uh hold on
[5782.20 → 5783.38] collections on this
[5783.38 → 5785.88] device screenshot where
[5785.88 → 5787.40] the where the hell is
[5787.40 → 5792.20] this um where did I
[5792.20 → 5794.52] sync this to you know
[5794.52 → 5795.48] what these are pictures
[5795.48 → 5796.56] I took on my old
[5796.56 → 5800.62] iPhone 12 Pro because I
[5800.62 → 5803.62] couldn't um because
[5803.62 → 5805.60] both my pixel and my
[5805.60 → 5806.86] iPhone were linked with
[5806.86 → 5809.10] a cable and displaying
[5809.10 → 5811.58] various states of sure of
[5811.58 → 5812.92] the transfer so in order
[5812.92 → 5814.62] to document this I
[5814.62 → 5815.76] yeah I had to I had to
[5815.76 → 5816.54] put it somewhere else so
[5816.54 → 5817.98] where did I put
[5817.98 → 5819.16] it I don't I don't think
[5819.16 → 5820.04] I put it on Google
[5820.04 → 5823.52] Drive bloody hell where
[5823.52 → 5824.44] did I put it oh you
[5824.44 → 5825.20] know what I think I can
[5825.20 → 5826.84] find it basically out of
[5826.84 → 5828.72] like 15,000 text messages
[5828.72 → 5829.68] or something it managed
[5829.68 → 5832.96] to transfer to and this
[5832.96 → 5834.24] is one of the things that
[5834.24 → 5837.40] I often go off about with
[5837.40 → 5839.84] Apple's software design and
[5839.84 → 5841.68] the reason for it is that
[5841.68 → 5843.26] as someone who uses a lot
[5843.26 → 5844.38] of devices and switches
[5844.38 → 5846.20] devices a lot and uses a
[5846.20 → 5846.98] lot of different kinds of
[5846.98 → 5848.04] apps and needs
[5848.04 → 5850.34] interoperability and
[5850.34 → 5852.40] has high expectations for
[5852.40 → 5854.22] a trillion yes with a T
[5854.22 → 5857.24] dollar company I run up
[5857.24 → 5860.02] against it a lot is
[5860.02 → 5861.74] Apple's design philosophy
[5861.74 → 5865.68] is it just works the
[5866.36 → 5867.64] problem is that when it
[5867.64 → 5871.50] doesn't it's just working it
[5871.50 → 5873.80] just works is baked in as
[5873.80 → 5875.86] an expectation so when it
[5875.86 → 5879.70] doesn't they often do not
[5879.70 → 5881.74] have the safeguards and
[5881.74 → 5883.68] backup plans that are baked
[5883.68 → 5885.58] into other platforms so
[5885.58 → 5886.96] it's like probably one of
[5886.96 → 5888.40] the best examples I have of
[5888.40 → 5891.14] this is when Apple removed
[5891.14 → 5894.60] the restart function yeah
[5894.60 → 5896.50] this used to have two
[5896.50 → 5898.30] sliders one to shut down
[5898.30 → 5901.12] one to restart, but it's an
[5901.12 → 5902.98] iPhone it should never need
[5902.98 → 5904.64] to be turned off and turned
[5904.64 → 5907.62] back on and I really I don't
[5907.62 → 5909.56] know this for sure but there
[5909.56 → 5911.42] is literally no other reason
[5911.42 → 5912.72] that I can think of why they
[5912.72 → 5914.34] would have removed it because it
[5914.34 → 5916.98] was and continues to be a very
[5916.98 → 5920.40] useful tool in fact I contacted
[5920.40 → 5921.92] Apple support, and it's one of the
[5921.92 → 5923.18] first things they asked me to do
[5923.18 → 5926.72] was restarted my iPhone so just
[5926.72 → 5929.80] give me the button to restart
[5929.80 → 5932.32] it why do I have to touch it
[5932.32 → 5934.56] twice I don't understand
[5934.56 → 5937.16] another one was this was back
[5937.16 → 5938.64] with my oldness is like 10 years
[5938.64 → 5939.66] ago so I don't even know if this
[5939.66 → 5940.90] is still true but when I did my
[5940.90 → 5943.32] I switched on Mac and finder
[5943.32 → 5945.94] didn't have a refresh well it
[5945.94 → 5948.48] should just refresh right but when
[5948.48 → 5951.22] it doesn't what do I do well you
[5951.22 → 5953.10] go fuck yourself is what you do
[5953.10 → 5955.38] that's your only real option so
[5955.38 → 5956.82] in this case with the transfer
[5956.82 → 5960.04] tool, so I'm using the what's it
[5960.04 → 5961.38] what's it called it's an Android
[5961.38 → 5963.22] app move to iOS I'm using the
[5963.22 → 5965.16] move to iOS app from Apple
[5965.16 → 5972.60] and hold on a second yeah here we
[5972.60 → 5974.10] go I'm just going to make sure that
[5974.10 → 5975.68] I'm not just an idiot, and I'm
[5975.68 → 5977.28] using like a third-party tool or
[5977.28 → 5978.60] something because I'm pretty darn
[5978.60 → 5980.66] sure that it's first-party Apple
[5980.66 → 5983.16] but I'd hate to accidentally upset
[5983.16 → 5986.08] Apple people again by if I'm
[5986.08 → 5987.24] actually wrong I don't mind
[5987.24 → 5988.84] upsetting them if is what I'm
[5988.84 → 5989.96] saying is accurate yes it's
[5989.96 → 5992.12] developed by Apple, so I'm using the
[5992.12 → 5995.88] move to iOS app and once again in
[5995.88 → 5998.74] classic Apple fashion when only two
[5998.74 → 6000.88] of your 15,000 text messages
[6000.88 → 6003.28] transfer there's no retry button
[6003.28 → 6007.80] there's no there's no do it again
[6007.80 → 6010.80] button oh that's annoying so the
[6010.80 → 6012.96] instructions from Apple support who
[6012.96 → 6015.24] were spectacularly unhelpful start from
[6015.24 → 6017.04] beginning again I'm assuming was to
[6017.04 → 6019.32] recipe the iPhone and try again yeah
[6019.32 → 6022.30] and I said well okay what are we
[6022.30 → 6024.36] changing this time that would result in
[6024.36 → 6026.16] a different outcome nothing, and they go
[6026.16 → 6027.92] oh well your internet might have caused
[6027.92 → 6030.38] an issue and I said I told you already
[6030.38 → 6032.14] earlier in this chat that I was
[6032.14 → 6035.26] connected with a cable what makes you
[6035.26 → 6038.30] think that my internet played a role in
[6038.30 → 6040.24] the failure of this what are we
[6040.24 → 6041.92] changing what are we doing
[6041.92 → 6043.98] differently because what happened was
[6043.98 → 6047.54] my WhatsApp messages did transfer, so I'm
[6047.54 → 6050.38] no longer signed in to WhatsApp and I
[6050.38 → 6052.56] could do a whole separate rant about
[6052.56 → 6056.22] WhatsApp and how that too is a modern
[6056.22 → 6058.52] communications platform that for
[6058.52 → 6061.28] whatever reason does allow multiple
[6061.28 → 6064.38] sign-in across devices but not two
[6064.38 → 6069.58] phones no never two phones, so I have to
[6069.58 → 6071.06] transfer, and you have to transfer
[6071.06 → 6073.10] WhatsApp when you are doing like the
[6073.10 → 6074.24] new phone setup too it drives me
[6074.24 → 6079.14] absolutely bananas so my WhatsApp did
[6079.14 → 6081.82] transfer over to the iPhone but my text
[6081.82 → 6083.68] messages are here, and I've had some bad
[6083.68 → 6085.82] experiences with whatsapp's
[6085.82 → 6088.46] backup and restore even when I explicitly
[6088.46 → 6092.52] click backup verify that it's backed up
[6092.52 → 6095.58] in the last one minute and then I
[6095.58 → 6097.66] restore it I'll be missing like a week of
[6097.66 → 6099.28] messages sometimes, and it's really
[6099.28 → 6100.92] frustrating I don't like that I don't
[6100.92 → 6102.76] like not having my communication history
[6102.76 → 6106.86] and like it's its legitimately caused
[6106.86 → 6108.66] problems for me sometimes remember that
[6108.66 → 6112.02] stupid scandal where someone accused me
[6112.02 → 6113.64] of something and I didn't have my WeChat
[6113.64 → 6115.50] history because I had like switched phones
[6115.50 → 6117.00] and didn't realize that it was like not
[6117.00 → 6119.58] cloud synced in any way it ended up
[6119.58 → 6121.86] being fine because they were caught in
[6121.86 → 6125.34] like multiple other lies that basically
[6125.34 → 6128.64] were like yeah just dismissing everything
[6128.64 → 6130.68] basically yeah so that was really useful
[6130.68 → 6133.20] of them to just like completely themselves
[6133.20 → 6135.54] like that, but I didn't I didn't have the
[6135.54 → 6138.00] DMS which was super inconvenient for me I
[6138.00 → 6142.20] don't like losing DMS, so I'm in a situation
[6142.20 → 6143.76] right now where my iPhone contains my
[6143.76 → 6146.10] WhatsApp messages and my Android phone
[6146.10 → 6149.34] contains my SMS messages there's no cloud
[6149.34 → 6151.98] sync for SMS they're asking me to wipe the
[6151.98 → 6155.36] iPhone which I don't know maybe I will get
[6155.36 → 6158.30] all my WhatsApp history back maybe all of
[6158.30 → 6160.06] the messages will transfer this time the
[6160.06 → 6161.88] whole experience just sucks
[6161.88 → 6169.52] so Google in order Google cloud sync for
[6169.52 → 6171.60] messages what the fuck is wrong with you
[6171.60 → 6173.18] it's another opportunity for you to sell
[6173.18 → 6174.96] more cloud storage like it should be pretty
[6174.96 → 6177.80] easy like now like just do it tomorrow
[6177.80 → 6179.76] yeah what are you waiting for it should be
[6179.76 → 6186.10] pretty easy number two WhatsApp hey just let
[6186.10 → 6188.40] me sign in across multiple devices like you
[6188.40 → 6191.14] know basically everything like what are you
[6191.14 → 6195.26] doing number three Apple retry buttons you
[6195.26 → 6197.80] don't need to be allergic to them, it's okay
[6197.80 → 6200.16] it's a lot better than starting the whole
[6200.16 → 6202.96] process all over again I understand I
[6202.96 → 6204.64] understand that you don't want it
[6204.64 → 6206.30] cluttering up your beautiful software
[6206.30 → 6209.24] whatever the fuck philosophy leads to you
[6209.24 → 6212.00] not having them I know I don't
[6212.00 → 6213.58] understand I think it's stupid but it
[6213.58 → 6215.12] doesn't matter the point is you can keep
[6215.12 → 6217.96] doing that how about only show me the
[6217.96 → 6220.66] retry button if I need it that way it
[6220.66 → 6223.18] doesn't have to be there like by default
[6223.18 → 6225.28] but you don't mind showing me a little
[6225.28 → 6227.02] some part of it failed yeah you don't
[6227.02 → 6228.44] mind showing me a triangle with an
[6228.44 → 6230.66] exclamation mark I backed up two of your
[6230.66 → 6233.68] messages thanks for fucking nothing if I
[6233.68 → 6237.00] click that it should let me retry thank
[6237.00 → 6239.12] you that's all I'm asking for
[6239.12 → 6244.54] one WhatsApp account now across multiple
[6244.54 → 6249.40] phones where linked from handyman
[6249.40 → 6251.48] is that a thing how did why did it sign
[6251.48 → 6255.20] me out then 2023 last year we introduced
[6255.20 → 6256.92] the ability for users globally message
[6256.92 → 6258.46] seamlessly across all their devices while
[6258.46 → 6261.38] making this similar present today we're
[6261.38 → 6262.84] improving our multi-device offering by
[6262.84 → 6264.90] introducing the ability to use the same
[6264.90 → 6266.56] WhatsApp account on multiple phones I
[6266.56 → 6268.58] didn't even I didn't even try to sign back
[6268.58 → 6270.78] in here so recently I ran into a really
[6270.78 → 6272.48] stupid thing with WhatsApp where I was
[6272.48 → 6274.46] like trying to use a QR code to do the
[6274.46 → 6276.76] thing and I couldn't scan the QR code and
[6276.76 → 6278.50] then it just didn't transfer properly and
[6278.50 → 6280.74] then I was really annoyed linking phones
[6280.74 → 6282.74] as companion devices makes messaging
[6282.74 → 6285.00] easier now you can switch between phones
[6285.00 → 6286.74] without signing out and pick up your
[6286.74 → 6290.24] chats where you left off so okay, okay I
[6290.24 → 6292.66] know I think this might be I think this
[6292.66 → 6295.04] might be solved I just signed back in I
[6295.04 → 6296.32] suspect you're signed out on your other
[6296.32 → 6297.88] one because you have to you have to link it
[6297.88 → 6301.78] as a companion device okay well either way
[6301.78 → 6304.66] I'm way happier with this then things
[6304.66 → 6307.66] were before like I was man I was super
[6307.66 → 6309.14] annoyed when I ran into that issue where
[6309.14 → 6311.40] it made me do the QR code thing to
[6311.40 → 6313.46] transfer them, and then it is like I couldn't
[6313.46 → 6315.08] scan it because the camera on the phone
[6315.08 → 6318.80] that I was switching to or from I can't
[6318.80 → 6320.38] remember was like too crappy to scan the
[6320.38 → 6322.46] QR code and couldn't handle the because it
[6322.46 → 6324.74] it turns it up to maximum brightness so
[6324.74 → 6326.34] there was a second before it would turn to
[6326.34 → 6328.98] maximum brightness where it would like be
[6328.98 → 6331.38] trying to scan it and it then it would
[6331.38 → 6333.38] like start to focus properly and then it
[6333.38 → 6334.74] would crank to maximum brightness and then it
[6334.74 → 6337.56] wouldn't be able to do it, and then it ended up not
[6337.56 → 6339.06] working, and then I ended up losing a bunch of my
[6339.06 → 6343.36] messages it was I have so freaking I think
[6343.36 → 6344.52] you're getting progressively less and less
[6344.52 → 6347.08] excited about the idea that I might have for
[6347.08 → 6350.22] you oh what is it signal or like what are
[6350.22 → 6353.16] we're talking no you do these I switch things
[6353.16 → 6355.96] yeah but the feedback every time is that
[6355.96 → 6360.00] you're not like really an Apple user so by not
[6360.00 → 6364.54] being you know marinated in the apple sauce
[6364.54 → 6367.64] you don't he means the feedback from
[6367.64 → 6371.58] outside parties yes yeah not my feedback no you
[6371.58 → 6375.24] you don't have I am an Apple user I just don't
[6375.24 → 6379.00] use enough Apple for Apple's liking I use these
[6379.00 → 6386.16] every day these are twos by the way I use yeah I
[6386.16 → 6391.74] have my own rant about the AirPods force but um, so I'm
[6391.74 → 6396.24] not in the sauce enough what if okay you did a
[6396.24 → 6404.78] year a year and what if what if what is maybe it
[6404.78 → 6408.82] wasn't even just an iPhone like you want me to go full Mac
[6408.82 → 6412.60] for a year I think you could do everything except a desktop and
[6412.60 → 6416.62] I think that would be fair because I think a lot of Mac
[6416.62 → 6420.42] people probably aren't into the whole dedicated desktop thing
[6420.42 → 6426.56] anyway and if they had one it might be for games and I think you
[6426.56 → 6432.00] could say like I'm I'm a streamer boy therefore I need a Windows desktop and
[6432.00 → 6435.30] you can have everything else and that is like a thing that is a Mac user
[6435.30 → 6442.16] archetype that is common I think that's fine so what if you did iPhone watch
[6442.16 → 6448.46] AirPods iPad MacBook for a year the hell would I do with an iPad I don't know
[6448.46 → 6454.64] giving you options I can't figure out what anybody does with an iPad I don't
[6454.64 → 6459.50] fully watch Netflix I think sure I mean you know what that's valid I just for me
[6459.50 → 6466.18] it's like it's this no man's land device like it's big and cumbersome enough that
[6466.18 → 6471.82] if I'm going to use it I might as well just get a laptop, and it's its not even that
[6471.82 → 6476.60] limited anymore like it used to be really limited but just like most of what I
[6476.60 → 6481.24] would need to do already on my phone so we're saying iPad Mini at that point
[6481.24 → 6485.32] why not just use your phone I don't know part of the reason why I included it in
[6485.32 → 6490.72] there was because then you're like fully in the ecosystem right the laptop can
[6490.72 → 6494.60] count as any form of computer, and then you have all the other Apple things
[6494.60 → 6502.26] basically I don't think I missed anything so yeah you are deep in the in
[6502.26 → 6508.72] in the walled garden I will think about it all right I'll think about it, I just
[6508.72 → 6513.98] could do update videos along the way I like just be you know what it's
[6513.98 → 6517.26] like at least four videos out there I haven't even I don't even think I'll be
[6517.26 → 6522.78] able to because the updates I did a switch to Mac not that long ago and after the
[6522.78 → 6528.52] first like week there's just there was stuff that was annoying but mostly it
[6528.52 → 6532.60] wasn't impeding my ability to get work done it was just I don't want it annoying
[6532.60 → 6535.84] I want it to not impede your ability to get work done, but that's the thing is I
[6535.84 → 6539.00] don't think I'm going to be able to do updates for a year because within a week
[6539.00 → 6543.90] of using any of those devices I'll be able to use them there will just be things
[6543.90 → 6548.72] that I don't like and some of it is just philosophical differences that I have
[6548.72 → 6555.36] with Apple like stuff like the not having a retry I don't I don't like that I
[6555.36 → 6561.24] don't agree with that and no amount of no amount of me using it is going to
[6561.24 → 6566.46] change that fundamentally I disagree with the assumption that something is going to
[6566.46 → 6573.04] work and not having a tailback I disagree with that because I have lived in the
[6573.04 → 6577.92] real world for long enough that I know that it doesn't work like that even for
[6577.92 → 6583.00] your product specifically Apple it just doesn't it doesn't work like that, and I do
[6583.00 → 6587.70] have my I do have my picture up, so I'm just going to try to find the right one
[6587.70 → 6592.76] here okay so yeah there's the okay so my first picture I took was at the top of
[6592.76 → 6601.02] the stairs of the code on the iPhone and my move to iOS app not picking it up even
[6601.02 → 6607.26] though they are both on the same Wi-Fi okay so that didn't work, so I went and got a
[6607.26 → 6615.18] cable oh that's a video just of the same thing okay that's the same thing hold on a second then
[6615.18 → 6619.42] I got a picture because you know I never know if I'll need these pictures for the video so then I got a
[6619.42 → 6626.16] picture of it transferring so it started transferring cable yeah LTT store.com soon the cables are
[6626.16 → 6634.82] coming dude I'm so excited they're awesome okay then I got a video of that apparently just trying to be
[6634.82 → 6639.28] thorough I'm trying to be thorough you know so our editors have stuff to cut away to then the next one I got
[6639.28 → 6645.98] I think I had an ETA oh no here we go transfer complete my ass
[6645.98 → 6656.32] so here why don't I send this to Dan I think I'm signed in to teams here who knows am I signed in to teams
[6656.32 → 6665.30] oh my god this is so leggy to make sure that you click remember me, and then it won't happen again yeah sure
[6665.30 → 6673.78] oh this is so this is so leggy I'm dying oh my god we can't both antagonize him Dan
[6673.78 → 6679.06] or you don't want to tag team him okay oh that's a weird way to put that oh
[6679.06 → 6686.86] oh wait it's not after dark yet never mind keep your pants on Geez you guys okay I'll send this to
[6686.86 → 6693.00] Dan, so this is hilarious if I didn't pay close attention I could easily think Dan do you want
[6693.00 → 6697.32] to throw that up there uh sure it's H-E-I-C, so I might have to do something fun with it
[6697.32 → 6706.06] yeah I'm going to have to like pre-convert that sorry serenity now so I could easily
[6706.06 → 6714.78] easily miss this because on the Android side again this is in Apple software Apple Inc. made this move
[6714.78 → 6722.62] to iOS app on the Android side it says everything's great successfully transferred
[6722.62 → 6730.78] and then you notice oh hold on a second there's little yellow exclamation marks everything is not
[6730.78 → 6739.26] okay on the iOS side, and it's not just a little bit not okay it's brutally not okay Dan how close
[6739.26 → 6743.50] are you because that that was all the stalling I had uh yeah that went good there you go nice there
[6743.50 → 6752.84] it is, so I had to click into this, so I had to click into this so if I have to click into it just give me
[6752.84 → 6758.08] a retry button they're still connected oh this is another funny thing so both of them had a message
[6758.08 → 6763.56] on them warning me to keep them connected to power while the transfer was running how the
[6763.56 → 6769.30] am I supposed to do that the phones are plugged into each other you empties it knows I'm using a cable
[6769.30 → 6778.74] uh MagSafe okay got him I could have two wireless chargers got him one for each phone
[6778.74 → 6784.58] but like come on your know like to come on man
[6784.58 → 6791.68] in fairness to me Luke that is in my notes
[6791.68 → 6802.24] I did think of it, but that is a spectacularly stupid solution sure yeah dang that's great solved
[6802.24 → 6807.74] it by connecting a cable yes technically having two wireless charging pads next to each other while
[6807.74 → 6813.42] they're plugged in would be an option but who realistically has a setup like that yeah yeah
[6813.42 → 6821.86] yeah I am aware that it could be done but that is so obtuse
[6821.86 → 6830.82] so it's so frustrating, and I'm clearly not the only one upset about it, I found this on discussions.apple.com
[6830.82 → 6838.16] this has uh hold on a second let me check move to iOS app transfer error solutions
[6838.16 → 6850.22] this was started uh let me see in 2021 this has been a problem for four years at least
[6850.22 → 6861.42] the me too's on this are 1,664 of people being like yep me too and there doesn't seem to be
[6861.42 → 6870.22] any real solution apple's tech support was so useless like so useless I talked to one I asked
[6870.22 → 6876.88] to be escalated they it just unceremoniously on the hour transferred me to someone new who hadn't
[6876.88 → 6881.74] read my case I guess their shift was just over, and they were like see ya nice then I asked them
[6881.74 → 6886.10] to be transferred to a level two tech they said hey level two is closed right now because it was
[6886.10 → 6891.20] late at night can I schedule a call back they called me back the next morning I was talking to level
[6891.20 → 6895.50] f***in gone again nice that's good I like that like I just
[6895.50 → 6902.40] I get it apple's your favourite company if your customers are so upset from dealing with your
[6902.40 → 6908.64] customer support that they hang up and stop trying on your cheapest level then you save money
[6908.64 → 6913.90] on your more expensive level of support yeah so I get that you love the taste of their d*** or
[6913.90 → 6921.22] whatever, but we should ask more from trillion-dollar companies the number of people that are mad at me
[6921.22 → 6927.20] for being mad just get tips that they removed the cable from the AirPods Pro threes that they no
[6927.20 → 6930.76] longer ship it with a cable that they have slowly should really have a cable that they should
[6930.76 → 6935.28] slowly that they've slowly whittled down the number of included accessories in their products
[6935.28 → 6941.74] um is mind-blowing to me, it's like why would you ask them that to include a cable I don't know
[6941.74 → 6949.18] why would I ask anyone to include a cable with their product I'm the'm the**hole like I just I
[6949.18 → 6955.86] can't really I can't really wrap my brain around that I saw this great picture um it's like what was
[6955.86 → 6964.60] lost uh iPhone accessories comparison hold on let me see if I can let me see if I can find it uh someone
[6964.60 → 6970.86] posted this great picture, and it was like it was only like four or five years ago that they included
[6970.86 → 6976.28] like a lightning to three and a half millimetre adapter they had dude they had like headphones
[6976.28 → 6981.78] they had stickers they had a wall wart they had a cable apple stickers were on like everything
[6981.78 → 6987.70] uh you know what I think it was on I think it was on Reddit uh I'm going to append Reddit to my search
[6987.70 → 6993.38] and no I can't find it if anyone from chat has the link I think it was on our slash all the other day
[6993.38 → 7002.46] uh, but it was it's its crazy how we've just accepted them and look if they lowered the price
[7002.46 → 7011.04] totally different situation if it's just a cable so if I even remotely believed that these choices
[7011.04 → 7019.26] had anything to do with environmental impact different situation I don't buy it I'm sorry
[7019.26 → 7029.56] but I just don't buy it Apple does so much that with intent creates additional waste in the world
[7029.56 → 7036.94] they do a lot well as well like I think the new uh the iPhone airs titanium chassis is like a significant
[7036.94 → 7042.94] percentage of remanufactured titanium which is super cool and that is perfect but they also
[7042.94 → 7049.90] do so much to create additional waste that I just I can't take it seriously I don't buy it if someone
[7049.90 → 7054.82] like Fairphone said hey we're not including a charger in the box because we felt that it was unnecessary
[7054.82 → 7060.60] you can add on a charger to your order for this very reasonable cost totally different conversation
[7060.60 → 7062.84] how much does Apple charge for a USB-C cable
[7062.84 → 7073.14] $30 is my guess okay let's find it for the shortest one charging essentials you can't call something
[7073.14 → 7079.50] essential and then not include it in the package 20 hold on is this cad though that's Canadian so 25
[7079.50 → 7090.58] Canadian dollars for this like that's pretty close basic cable is this even USB 3 USB 2 nice
[7090.58 → 7093.58] 25 Canadian dollars nice
[7093.58 → 7097.58] let's go
[7097.58 → 7105.74] USB 2 on this one too, but it's 2 meter so that's something for 35 Canadian dollars
[7105.74 → 7110.46] the Beats one is cheaper and longer I don't even know why they bothered to acquire Beats dude
[7110.46 → 7115.78] and braided they were acquiring a brand, and then they stole the sound signature it's like
[7115.78 → 7122.62] you took the least valuable thing about Beats, although I have heard DMS is literally sitting
[7122.62 → 7128.86] there going like this right now I will acknowledge I will acknowledge that some of the latter Beats
[7128.86 → 7136.42] headphones actually were somewhat decent but did you ever listen to the first generation Beats by DRE
[7136.42 → 7143.42] mm-hmm I have two things sure hit me you'll probably enjoy and hate both of them one uh
[7143.42 → 7151.42] I went through and looked at all the Beats measurements I have most of them are less V-shaped than the AirPods Pro 3
[7151.42 → 7160.42] the other thing is apparently according to Reddit so many people are returning AirPods Pro 3s that they are offering some people partial refunds just to keep them
[7160.42 → 7161.42] whoa
[7161.42 → 7166.42] so there's that I don't know I think you're too mad about it
[7166.42 → 7167.42] oh yeah
[7167.42 → 7176.42] I mean look clout chaser is going to clout chase is all I really have to say about that at this point like it seemed
[7176.42 → 7181.18] it seemed honestly I watched it you didn't even seem that upset I'm like I've seen him way more mad at stuff
[7181.18 → 7184.10] I don't know what people are freaking out about
[7184.10 → 7191.70] I think it just seemed like a perfect formula for raising your own profile and
[7191.70 → 7196.12] virtue signalling your own integrity or whatever to attack me for a while
[7196.12 → 7202.50] like that was kind of trendy yeah sure and I think that some people haven't got the memo that
[7202.50 → 7209.14] like it's not as much any more not as much any more I think there's I think there's a group that
[7209.14 → 7219.26] you know is still really mad sure um about the completely worthless water cooling concept that some
[7219.26 → 7226.88] company had that I said wouldn't work, and it didn't work um and I there were things about it that I didn't
[7226.88 → 7231.64] handle well admittedly there were things about it that were not handled well that were completely out of my
[7231.64 → 7238.92] control um and didn't go well, but you know whatever there's a certain number of people that are still
[7238.92 → 7244.24] extremely mad about that and then there's like everyone else who either never cared or has just
[7244.24 → 7251.44] oh my god moved on at this point um and so the whole just attack Linus for saying a thing that is
[7251.44 → 7260.40] in this case objectively true I don't know sure good luck with that good plan all you do is harm
[7260.40 → 7266.62] your own credibility at that point I think which is kind of sad because I would like to see I'd like
[7266.62 → 7273.26] to see the tech media space and the tech YouTuber space be more unified I'd like to see us working
[7273.26 → 7280.04] together for the benefit of the consumer I would like to see us working towards holding companies
[7280.04 → 7286.30] accountable maybe that's just because I don't personally like the taste of apples
[7286.30 → 7296.26] prefer oranges maybe it's an acquired taste might be maybe I just need to suck it more maybe you just
[7296.26 → 7304.08] brush your teeth you know I have a toothbrush right here maybe I just need to maybe I need to
[7304.08 → 7308.94] cleanse my palate before maybe I should use no computers for a month oh before I switch to a man
[7308.94 → 7314.74] pop a mint
[7314.74 → 7330.30] sorry did someone say that yeah oh man um so what you're saying is apple should make a toothbrush
[7330.30 → 7337.76] anyway
[7337.76 → 7347.40] uh what are we supposed to be talking about Qualcomm announces the snapdragon x2 elite and x2 elite
[7347.40 → 7352.98] extreme I remember telling Qualcomm that their naming scheme was a dumpster fire somehow they made
[7352.98 → 7359.20] it is worse good job Qualcomm um intel and am dare not your role models that you think they are
[7359.20 → 7364.30] one year after announcing the original snapdragon x Qualcomm is showing off its new snapdragon x2 elite
[7364.30 → 7369.70] and x2 extreme oh no isn't it elite extreme yeah I think so, but you see even our own writers managed
[7369.70 → 7375.12] to copy it wrong because it made no sense x2 elite will come in two flavours with one having 18 cores
[7375.12 → 7381.40] good lord and 53 legs of cache and the other having 12 cores and 34 legs of cache with the 18 core
[7381.40 → 7385.54] edition having a slight performance advantage in dual-core frequency with them otherwise being very
[7385.54 → 7393.46] similar these both have a 128 bit bus the x2 elite extreme has 4.4 gigahertz max on 18 cores and reaches
[7393.46 → 7399.44] 5 gigahertz on single or dual-core loads 53 legs of cache and a 192 bit bus this thing should be an
[7399.44 → 7405.42] absolute monster the arena dedicated dpu display processing unit I guess they don't want to call it
[7405.42 → 7411.94] graphics yikes uh the arena DPU on all the chips can run three displays at up to 4k 144 hertz and Qualcomm
[7411.94 → 7418.44] is claiming these are the fastest and most efficient processors for a Windows pc two of the reference
[7418.44 → 7424.20] designs include the very cool for air jet instead of system fans uh which you can check out our
[7424.20 → 7429.46] computer video on we covered that a little while ago um I have actually been back on my snapdragon
[7429.46 → 7436.88] um laptop recently because there's a video coming on this soon the liquid metal leaked out of my rogue flow
[7436.88 → 7442.46] x13, and I was super upset about that because I freaking love that laptop and I want a next gen one
[7442.46 → 7446.02] and I'll buy it again even with the liquid metal I'll just take the liquid metal out I'll put some
[7446.02 → 7452.14] PTM 7950 in there I freaking love that laptop it comes with liquid metal yeah was that the stock
[7452.14 → 7458.92] application of liquid metal you better believe it bub, so I have to own at least part of the blame for it
[7458.92 → 7466.14] I was a little rough with it, and it was warm I think it might have been that time I tossed my backpack
[7466.14 → 7472.18] and it is the laptop when you tried to like to throw it over the laptop was probably warm and it probably
[7472.18 → 7479.90] like made it come out but either way I was not happy, and my laptop is now dead we tried to recover it
[7479.90 → 7488.00] and um it's an it's a long video it's an adventure it's an adventuresome video anyway uh good luck Qualcomm
[7488.00 → 7492.14] i I hope the adoption of these next generation processors is a little higher
[7492.14 → 7503.72] AI performer gets a record deal oh man no but millions of listens on Spotify regularly gets 100
[7503.72 → 7510.26] 000 views on Instagram, and it's all AI stuff and likeness vocals and music all AI generated
[7510.26 → 7518.90] and they purportedly got uh three million dollar offer with Hailwood media
[7518.90 → 7531.80] okay I hate it um cool I'm gonna we're I'm just going to close that I've had enough of AI being
[7531.80 → 7537.30] horrible for one day I like it uh should we talk about other things yeah valves under fire after block
[7537.30 → 7542.78] blasters a free-to-play game was updated about a month after release to install malware that
[7542.78 → 7550.00] allegedly steals the funds of their users the game had allegedly stolen at least 150 000 us dollars
[7550.00 → 7556.94] from its users before being removed from steam on September 21st including 32 000 from Latvian streamer
[7556.94 → 7565.26] Rico Plavix cancer treatment fund oh come on apparently there was a spear phishing campaign
[7565.26 → 7570.84] targeting creators for sponsorship opportunities this isn't even the first time this year that
[7570.84 → 7576.08] steam has been used to distribute malware in February 2025 oh let's start that sorry that was this
[7576.08 → 7581.40] year in February pirate phi installed a Trojan horse in March sniper phantom's resolution demo would
[7581.40 → 7586.54] open a browser and steal user credentials and in July chemical game installer would also install
[7586.54 → 7595.70] multiple payloads of malware is pirating safer ah oh i I doubt it come across some sketchy
[7595.70 → 7599.48] stuff anyway we just wanted you guys to be aware of that command prompt and another what's that doing
[7599.48 → 7601.18] another quick game related
[7601.18 → 7611.54] you're good you can go another quick game is this what it's like yeah yep another quick game related all
[7611.54 → 7618.68] the time FYI is ascent rivals has some pretty deep crypto connections we highlighted this game last
[7618.68 → 7627.10] week it was that like pod case pod cancer uh pod caster no pod racer that pod racing looking look
[7627.10 → 7633.62] alike that is how it feels Luke was pretty excited about um ascent rivals though is built on the Cardano
[7633.62 → 7641.46] blockchain um g nun games the indie studio behind ascent rivals stated that NFT holders can join teams
[7641.46 → 7646.38] based on their NFTs, and they're apparently using web 3 for sponsorships during tournaments like
[7646.38 → 7652.50] purchasing in-game billboards so far it doesn't look super horrible, but none of that really bothers
[7652.50 → 7662.02] me too much i just I didn't there was a line that was like oh where is it we just definitely
[7662.02 → 7667.76] wanted you guys to be aware that we're not endorsing the game we don't have any kinds of partnerships
[7667.76 → 7675.70] here we have no idea yeah we have no idea what kind of massive win for web 3 gaming or whatever
[7675.70 → 7683.02] yeah this is going to be I'm not interested in that we have zero interest in NFTs in the game no um
[7683.02 → 7689.34] i literally just went oh I'm racing a pod yeah and then wanted to tell people because I thought it was
[7689.34 → 7696.94] neat yeah i we're not uh yeah we this speaking of other folks that we're not partnered with um
[7696.94 → 7703.16] disclosure I invested in a NAS software specifically because of bullshit like this
[7703.16 → 7710.22] and that decision gets validated on a super regular basis this is rough I invested in Esther who's making
[7710.22 → 7718.42] hex OS which is essentially a four dummies interface for true NAS so it's true NAS under the hood and it's
[7718.42 → 7724.96] a shiny easy to car drive uh on the outside and I'm super excited about it, they are doing some really
[7724.96 → 7731.50] cool stuff uh you can check them out at hex os.com why am I so excited and feeling so validated right
[7731.50 → 7738.20] now because some Sinology NAS models that were previously capable of hardware transcoding had
[7738.20 → 7745.06] the relevant drivers removed and not only that but deliberately blocked at the kernel level according
[7745.06 → 7753.68] to user shared support tickets cool Sinology you guys weren't like enough of a rip-off already for
[7753.68 → 7760.08] crappy hardware now you got to do this Sinology announced it would offload media processing to
[7760.08 → 7768.26] client devices in July 2024 citing licensing costs for HEVC YouTuber NAS compares covered the change in
[7768.26 → 7774.56] detail and pointed out AVC is license free and other Sinology systems with the same CPU but that
[7774.56 → 7780.08] advertised uh but advertised for Plex hosting b station maintain transcoding capabilities
[7780.08 → 7787.44] Nazi compares also published a guide to get hardware transcoding back which you shouldn't have to do
[7787.44 → 7796.20] so yeah very excited for what the team over at hex OS or excuse me Esther is cooking up with hex OS
[7796.20 → 7802.70] they are still how are they doing they're they're still in like updates alpha um actually oh that
[7802.70 → 7807.90] reminds me since the last time we significantly talked about them, I owe john a response he messaged me
[7807.90 → 7812.76] the other day what did he oh yeah he messaged me on discord uh I don't know if this is for public
[7812.76 → 7819.64] consumption but sure it is now I think you leaked their stuff anyway so well the precedence is set
[7819.64 → 7825.72] he says sorry for the washed out screen this is from today uh snipping tool plus HDR is a nasty
[7825.72 → 7830.20] combination, but you get the idea by the way that complaint you mentioned the welcome screen
[7830.20 → 7839.54] addressed in the q3 update we're publishing ah whatever Monday uh so I don't know what I'm looking at here
[7839.54 → 7841.56] but he recorded a video
[7841.56 → 7851.34] okay cool he just met so they made it so that the welcome wizard is uh harder to accidentally navigate
[7851.34 → 7855.94] away from and then not be sure how to get back to sure so super cool it just kind of walks you through
[7855.94 → 7861.70] creating users and creating shares, and it used to be that if you like created a share and then just
[7861.70 → 7867.82] went like back in your browser you were just lost uh whereas now that's not the case anymore so uh hex OS
[7867.82 → 7875.90] man and one of the things that that was a red line for me to invest was that there would be a lifetime
[7875.90 → 7883.04] license there will be a lifetime license it will not include services that have an ongoing cost
[7883.04 → 7887.72] so like if you want to buy cloud storage from them or something like that you want to you want to back
[7887.72 → 7894.10] up to the cloud, or you want to use uh you know some kind of like data forwarding um that they that
[7894.10 → 7900.10] they have ongoing costs for it won't include that but what it will include is the basic functionality of
[7900.10 → 7907.64] the software for life um and that was a major thing for me is like guys I understand that
[7907.64 → 7911.56] software companies these days got a software company you got to have subscriptions, and they're going to have
[7911.56 → 7916.30] subscription services and stuff, but there might not be as many jobs for developers out there but
[7916.30 → 7923.74] they're still expensive, but you should have the option for a NAS for something that the whole point of
[7923.74 → 7931.94] it is that you own it you should have an option to own it that's the point so I'm uh I'm very excited
[7931.94 → 7940.34] for them to uh to get this thing out of beta and uh and get this show on the road I just want to
[7940.34 → 7949.24] roll it for everything and that's it for topics so should we move into after dark sure if you insist
[7949.24 → 7957.42] we certainly can okay Dan look at this guy's checked out huh checked out sorry, sorry I'm on TikTok
[7957.42 → 7965.34] what did you say banner to after dark it's not end of the show okay well at least not on Tylenol I'd hate
[7965.34 → 7972.72] for you to get the Tim that's true that's true I need to start macro dosing that really you want
[7972.72 → 7980.68] more Tim yeah not a ton more I think a little bit going I've always wanted to be into trains just a
[7980.68 → 7984.84] little bit just a little bit more I just want to appreciate our rail system a little more
[7984.84 → 7994.60] that's about it collect things okay merch messages how is it possible that blatant UI errors make the
[7994.60 → 7999.86] final product from a major company for example the YouTube music widget in Google Maps blocks its own
[7999.86 → 8008.98] button and half of the road hazards buttons my theory is that the people who are in charge of
[8008.98 → 8017.82] these projects don't actually daily drive them like there 's's so many little things that are just
[8017.82 → 8028.42] kind of obvious like my car for instance it has um it has an individual configurable like drive mode
[8028.42 → 8034.66] so that you can be like well I want like really stiff suspension but i I don't want it like a
[8034.66 → 8038.86] custom one I don't want it lowered to the ground load out for your car yeah and I don't want the like
[8038.86 → 8045.28] super aggressive throttle response like i I want it like this um you cannot if I recall correctly
[8045.28 → 8051.08] configure the regenerative braking because Porsche just has their own philosophy of
[8051.08 → 8055.58] one pedal driving they don't believe in it or whatever which is like yeah that's not really your
[8055.58 → 8061.80] decision that's my decision i I'm the one who paid the money for it but whatever um and the
[8061.80 → 8067.12] irritating thing for me is that I have to switch to it every single time I get in the car because i
[8067.12 → 8073.24] never want to use one of their profiles that I cannot edit so I have to tick tick tick
[8073.24 → 8078.78] tick switch over to it every time I get in the car, and it's just that's annoying why it doesn't
[8078.78 → 8083.96] matter it's the champagneest of champagne problems can you switch while driving just random side
[8083.96 → 8089.90] question okay yep you can totally switch while driving it's just unnecessary yeah I just shouldn't
[8089.90 → 8097.90] have to yeah same thing for stuff like how I can't type on my touch screen my passenger is not allowed
[8097.90 → 8105.08] to type on my touch screen when the car is in motion it's like you do understand that voice commands just
[8105.08 → 8109.86] like don't work I mean you're German so I'm sure your voice commands are even worse than ours
[8109.86 → 8115.52] because like they probably speak precisely you think so you think they just have better
[8115.52 → 8121.96] better enunciation I mean that is entirely possible, but it's just there's just so many
[8121.96 → 8127.92] little things that I look at and I just go like yeah you just obviously don't daily use this yeah um
[8127.92 → 8134.40] I think it's I think it's the ford CEO that was dairying a BYD car that's super cool I heard he
[8134.40 → 8139.80] still was that's super cool like yeah you're the CEO of ford you could probably just have a driver
[8139.80 → 8145.86] drive you around in a Bentley or whatever and never touch a steering wheel but how can you possibly
[8145.86 → 8151.90] hope to run a car company unless you are driving your company's cars driving competitors cars like
[8151.90 → 8158.74] really caring I think that's really cool and I just see, so many examples like you said of software
[8158.74 → 8164.50] that clearly has never been used like really used by the people who are allegedly in charge of
[8164.50 → 8169.76] overseeing it with that said fairly unimportant clarification but someone's going to call us on
[8169.76 → 8180.10] if it was a Xiaomi su7 sorry my bad not somebody's gonna um, but the flip side of that is we
[8180.10 → 8185.02] talked about this earlier you can't have a hundred thousand people perfectly aligned on a mission and
[8185.02 → 8188.78] there are all kinds of stuff that makes it into our finished products that yeah I totally wouldn't
[8188.78 → 8194.16] have approved of but I never saw it or and you can't, and you can't see everything if you want to
[8194.16 → 8199.96] do any significant volume of things at scale you're not going to see everything if you want to create
[8199.96 → 8206.50] rather than critique you will discover that it's really hard, and you get you'll there are both sides
[8206.50 → 8213.58] of the story exact same people complaining about not giving enough people agency to do their own thing
[8213.58 → 8220.56] and and and the the know being too hard on people for failures and wanting to give people rope
[8220.56 → 8226.60] to try and experiment and do stuff like that and then any single mistake that ever comes out is
[8226.60 → 8230.68] your fault, and you should have done for not overseeing it better yeah yeah it's like what do you
[8230.68 → 8237.80] the exact same argument will come from the exact same person yeah that one's fun things happen I don't know
[8237.80 → 8248.22] up next hi l1 l2 and dram been yeah nice typical been 15 years since the Olympics came to town do you have
[8248.22 → 8256.96] any fond memories from those events I actually didn't go downtown at all um I was in Victoria I thought it was
[8256.96 → 8265.80] hilarious when Canada won because uh the gold medal hockey game okay because they had those um they had those
[8265.80 → 8271.06] they had those this is our game or whatever like scotia bank ads throughout the entire hockey tournament
[8271.06 → 8278.52] and they were like super polished, and they were professional ads do you remember after Canada won
[8278.52 → 8285.44] there was like an extra bit that looked like absolute dog because they just like threw it together
[8285.44 → 8291.34] when Canada actually made it deep into the tournament and just in case they won it was like a clip that they
[8291.34 → 8296.36] were ready for no I don't remember that, and it just like it looked like absolute trash they probably
[8296.36 → 8301.02] should have just done nothing I forget if the resolution I forget if the resolution was super low
[8301.02 → 8306.70] or just like it was missing some of the other assets or something like that just as a tech person who
[8306.70 → 8315.76] you know appreciates um the difficulty of putting on a production I just found it extremely amusing
[8315.76 → 8323.36] that someone's job out there was to have this asset ready on the off chance that Canada won the whole
[8323.36 → 8328.34] thing so that they could like to put it up but probably no one would ever see it, and they were probably so
[8328.34 → 8335.74] busy doing other things that they just like didn't care uh oh dude, so good man there was I my mom
[8335.74 → 8338.50] tried to convince me to volunteer and I'm like annoyed that I didn't
[8338.50 → 8346.84] because the volunteers got these like sick jackets oh wow that's super nice they looked
[8346.84 → 8353.46] so cool they had the writing on the arm they had a little logo wow Hudson's bay made a product
[8353.46 → 8359.18] somebody wanted good for them, I mean it was 20 it was 15 years ago but I thought these are doing
[8359.18 → 8368.28] well now awesome they were so sick it's nice when people like try yeah they were dope
[8368.28 → 8371.78] and you got them from volunteering and I should have just done it my mom was right
[8371.78 → 8380.96] got him up next uh hi duty hello I'm pursuing a degree in tech management and recently realized
[8380.96 → 8387.54] I'm one out of two out of 20 in a class that actually reads the material and doesn't have
[8387.54 → 8394.10] ChatGPT do my homework uh teacher doesn't care should I stop trying no, no kind of stupid question
[8394.10 → 8400.06] is that you'll probably just do better you should not ask questions like that because
[8400.06 → 8407.16] that's not good management you should take pride in your work, and you should do a good job because
[8407.16 → 8414.80] that should be something that you that is part of your identity as a person
[8414.80 → 8423.60] you're welcome Luke thanks for actually being here today why are you so cheap yeah
[8423.60 → 8434.20] David throwing hands is that it that's the whole thing he bought a blank t-shirt just to
[8434.20 → 8440.50] ask you that do better I think he could have just said wait did they buy our cheapest possible
[8440.50 → 8445.94] no they bought uh they bought some they picked up a couple extra tolls okay so they bought a couple
[8445.94 → 8451.98] of our cheapest no we don't have extra tolls Dan they bought two extra large shadows in tall
[8451.98 → 8460.66] uh sorry short sleeves uh when I was young we were doing great and then when I was medium young
[8460.66 → 8465.34] uh my there was a big accident in my dad's work, and he was out of work for a long time
[8465.34 → 8471.50] and he had to like it got really bad for a while there we were close to losing the house and then he
[8471.50 → 8477.50] had to go to our doctor and be like to you need to let me work again because like things are going to
[8477.50 → 8482.48] get a lot worse for me to the point where it would be worse for me to not work than it would for me to
[8482.48 → 8486.86] do work so let me go back, and then he got if I remember correctly and I'm pretty sure this is
[8486.86 → 8491.76] accurate two full-time jobs and a part-time job within like a week and just went like sicko mode
[8491.76 → 8498.82] for way too long and I don't fully know how he is alive um, but he like saved the family and everything
[8498.82 → 8506.38] was crazy and I learned some appreciation for like having cash in the bank um yeah and i it's not
[8506.38 → 8515.12] that I don't spend money I spend money on experiences I prefer to buy small amount of nice thing that will
[8515.12 → 8520.48] last that I can repair that money on health I spend money on health I spend money on keeping myself
[8520.48 → 8528.26] going um gym equipment things like that on other people he won't say it but I'll say it Luke spends
[8528.26 → 8537.38] money on other people yeah um that is true I ran into your dad this week curling yeah we had uh
[8537.38 → 8543.30] we had a quarterly event for the writing department which I'm informally part of because no other
[8543.30 → 8549.68] department that does quarterly events includes me um so we went curling which was organized by
[8549.68 → 8554.04] David panorama who's super awesome he's a relatively new member of the team, but he's uh
[8554.04 → 8560.22] he's dived right in he's been doing awesome and um he organized a curling night, and it was the first
[8560.22 → 8565.80] time I had curled since nerd sports which was the first time I had curled ever yeah and I still suck
[8565.80 → 8572.84] that makes sense yeah it's really hard yeah it was fun though it was fun as heck did he was he
[8572.84 → 8577.12] just like busy the whole time or did he like he came over to chat with us, but he had stuff to do
[8577.12 → 8581.90] yeah yeah, but he actually helped with a little bit of coaching for the other group it wasn't my group
[8581.90 → 8589.16] um did you have like two sheets yeah, yeah okay it makes sense that's two lanes for the bowlers out
[8589.16 → 8595.92] there yeah yeah there you go but yeah I don't know uh i also just, and you know maybe
[8595.92 → 8600.44] it's something that's wrong with me or whatever I don't really consider it that way I feel much more
[8600.44 → 8607.68] comfortable um I don't feel a need to buy a bunch of this stuff like I feel personally attacked I don't
[8607.68 → 8612.98] get that much fulfillment from just buying things I do get fulfillment from buying something that I like
[8612.98 → 8617.08] spent a lot of time like i I haven't been able to use it because my house is in shambles right now
[8617.08 → 8622.36] but uh I'm very excited about the big screen beyond that wasn't cheap that was a bunch of
[8622.36 → 8627.90] that was not cheap I took it out of the box I put a little cover on and just placed it against my face
[8627.90 → 8632.86] and just everything went black immediately because it's perfectly formed perfect oh I'm excited about
[8632.86 → 8640.56] that thing it feels great I'm stoked so like i I do spend money I just make sure that I have an ample
[8640.56 → 8648.18] amount saved ready for the rainiest day you could have um and that makes me very comfortable and i
[8648.18 → 8650.74] like being in that state so I do that
[8650.74 → 8660.56] hey LLD what happened to the 3d printed water cooling tube you had made did it hold up was there
[8660.56 → 8669.04] an update on it that I just missed happy to see tall shirts are back in stock uh I believe we did
[8669.04 → 8675.84] update yeah we did updates for six months on the 3d printed hardline water cooled computer challenge
[8675.84 → 8684.88] over on float plane so here's what it looked like after three months JK subscribe to float plane
[8684.88 → 8693.62] leg.GG slash float plane got him hi land Dino and drake uh-oh uh what are the coolest modifications
[8693.62 → 8700.64] that you've seen made to the Ltd backpack I replaced the Ltd logo with my own patch added power cord
[8700.64 → 8707.32] handles and extra inner pockets and loops I was just kidding before by the way the 3d printed tubes
[8707.32 → 8713.44] did hold up um super cool you don't actually have to subscribe to float plane just to get that answer
[8713.44 → 8718.34] this is why we don't go to parties it's just trolling them um I think that's probably the most
[8718.34 → 8725.24] modified backpack that I've heard of uh have you guys seen a more modified backpack than that
[8725.24 → 8734.70] oh there's one here what oh are you is this an oh wait are you the one who left the merch message or
[8734.70 → 8740.56] what oh no that was just this is like the same this is like the same list of stuff okay well here can
[8740.56 → 8746.78] we see it it's its bank show me your sack this is dming's backpack massively overfills it to the
[8746.78 → 8755.30] point where it's going to like explode all the time okay I have pointed out that he could not have that
[8755.30 → 8763.76] wait so he ruined the zipper it went through surgery and then just zip tied one side of the backpack shut
[8763.76 → 8773.06] yeah yeah it's like literally always exploding every time I see it I like a mud kit you know this
[8773.06 → 8777.56] is like for a lot of airlines like personal item sized, and then you can have a bigger carry-on
[8777.56 → 8781.98] as well okay, okay um okay thanks dms
[8781.98 → 8790.24] I'm just i you know what if you're happy I'm happy uh okay Dan hit me didn't say it had to be
[8790.24 → 8798.92] modified well uh hey Linus Luke and sound guy with the video this week on that 30 000 GPU if you guys
[8798.92 → 8804.04] had one yourself is there something you could actually use it for or would it just be like a
[8804.04 → 8810.34] novelty item you have absolutely lab said it was like salivating at the idea of having something like
[8810.34 → 8818.58] that more permanently uh whether it's for like AI coding assistance or uh machine vision for um
[8818.58 → 8823.70] like recognizing UI elements and like verifying in-game settings um what are some of the other
[8823.70 → 8831.26] things they wanted to do with it those are the main things, but there's also other like uh machine
[8831.26 → 8837.26] vision powered tasks that we're planning that it could be applied to but I mean there are other ways
[8837.26 → 8844.80] and there's also waiting a little bit I mean um the AI industry is marching ever onward and so
[8844.80 → 8851.30] there will come a time not long from now when literally millions of these GPUs will be liquidated
[8851.30 → 8857.54] on places like server parts deals and that'll be nuts we'll be ready that'll be actually crazy
[8857.54 → 8864.32] uh there's also the Chinese GPU companies that are trying we'll see how they go we'll see what happens
[8864.32 → 8875.62] up next Luke does float plane participate in standards bodies like seta no that was a short answer
[8875.62 → 8881.26] what is it I don't even I never heard of that uh I've heard I don't remember hearing of it streaming video
[8881.26 → 8887.10] technology alliance yeah I've heard like they would pick up our phone call okay let's move on
[8887.10 → 8894.90] yeah how is the preparation going for whale land is this the first time this is the first time sorry
[8894.90 → 8901.48] this is oh you better this is the first time I've been in a country that I wasn't born in I am very
[8901.48 → 8906.24] excited and the border agent didn't believe me when I told him why I was crossing that's hilarious I'm
[8906.24 → 8914.58] going to a gaming party uh love it uh prep is going okay I still have some more things to do tonight
[8914.58 → 8919.56] after when show and I will probably still have some more things to do in the morning but i very
[8919.56 → 8926.44] much look forward to seeing you all there um I'm going to be setting up a 5v5 tape to tape I think
[8926.44 → 8931.56] I said that on pre-show I'm not sure if I talked about that on when but uh it's weird not having
[8931.56 → 8938.16] it after when I don't know that it's bad it's just weird well you're more than welcome to you know
[8938.16 → 8942.64] come help set up the 5v5 I'm going to be zipping over are you going over there nice just to see it
[8942.64 → 8948.10] yeah help a little bit if I can okay cool whatever yeah well I'll be over there hello
[8948.10 → 8954.60] DLL grabbing some new blanks love the feel and fit of my current ones heck yeah what is the process you
[8954.60 → 8960.28] go through to pick up the right material it's rare to find anything near the quality you have so
[8960.28 → 8968.82] quality is subjective there was another YouTuber who took issue with the materials that we use in our
[8968.82 → 8976.46] blanks uh they basically believe that anything that doesn't have 100 cotton is garbage um I don't
[8976.46 → 8983.22] agree i actually really like the feel of a cotton poly blend um, so there 's's some subjectivity
[8983.22 → 8992.14] there and that's kind of the answer is because I really like them so we went through countless
[8992.14 → 8997.72] blank suppliers to find one that I really liked, and then we went with that
[8997.72 → 9007.60] greetings wan.dll my question is for Linus I've been watching a lot of older early wan shows
[9007.60 → 9013.32] do you ever miss having your cats on set love to hear your singles mewing in the background
[9013.32 → 9018.98] lol I have wanted to have an office pet basically for as long as we've had an office
[9018.98 → 9025.32] and every single time like rodent incursions come up in a meeting I'm like
[9025.32 → 9033.86] hear me out do cats kill flies office cat um they can not all but particularly good hunters will just
[9033.86 → 9038.76] kill anything they'll just kill everything is there a breed of cat that are particularly good
[9038.76 → 9045.72] hunters there can be flying so here's the problem is that cats are likely to cats that's calm down
[9045.72 → 9052.88] cats are likely to be an allergen for people that is the reason that we didn't have an office cat from
[9052.88 → 9057.42] the moment we moved in here was that there was someone on staff who was allergic to cats that
[9057.42 → 9062.98] person is actually no longer here but I'm sure someone else is allergic and I've always someone
[9062.98 → 9070.10] at some time I've always been of the mind that my love of cats cannot possibly trump someone else's
[9070.10 → 9076.60] being comfortable at work what just that was just amazing thank you yeah I hope that gets clipped
[9076.60 → 9084.90] um I do people allergic to bats because we could get bats for the fly problems the fly problems
[9084.90 → 9093.66] are deeply not solved lizards I don't need a new I don't need an uh a hundred of Coverdale flu
[9093.66 → 9097.00] okay that leaked from a LTT lab
[9097.00 → 9109.96] okay what's next oh Geez at Luke I know you're using Cloudflare for float plane delivery but do you use
[9109.96 → 9119.38] any of the dev plant at features or just CDN and we we use like yeah a bunch of stuff we've well I'm just
[9119.38 → 9127.58] going to talk more generally but uh we use the heck out of workers we use uh r2 um we use a lot
[9127.58 → 9134.20] of Cloudflare things clip that we use the heck out of workers it's an it's a thing i know
[9134.20 → 9139.80] when one fails we just redeploy another one
[9139.80 → 9147.52] we have hundreds they're disposable we have uh yeah over a thousand if I remember correctly
[9147.52 → 9151.94] uh, and you just don't even pay them you just toss it out when you don't want it anymore
[9151.94 → 9156.50] um yeah i have to stop googling how to kill children at work
[9156.50 → 9162.08] mother won't kill child what do I do the ones at work, or you're at work when you're googling how to
[9162.08 → 9167.24] kill children in general that's the one yeah you can't get us cheat GPT because you just get blocked
[9167.24 → 9173.80] but do I does it just block you or does it ask you what you mean I don't know I don't normally just
[9173.80 → 9178.08] go around I feel like I have to do that now I don't know I just don't understand why you're having
[9178.08 → 9183.32] trouble with if it's not that hard I don't know how to do it from the command line well like they're
[9183.32 → 9191.56] weak my experience is all in car not cloud infrastructure all right next anyway yeah we
[9191.56 → 9198.62] use genuinely a lot of their things uh r2 is SEM uh it's not semi new to us, we've been using it for
[9198.62 → 9205.22] like since the beginning of r2 but uh we have started using it significantly more now um
[9205.22 → 9212.28] and yeah I wouldn't be too surprised if we keep using more stuff I've said it forever I really love
[9212.28 → 9217.80] the product of Cloudflare there are some issues with it, I really wish it played a little bit
[9217.80 → 9225.48] nicer with Australia um, but it's its a fantastic product other parts of Cloudflare maybe not as big
[9225.48 → 9234.24] of a fan, but their products are great hi DLL for Linus have you thought about whole room VR for the
[9234.24 → 9240.06] land side of the badminton centre zero latency VR is an amazing experience with cool games like space
[9240.06 → 9246.46] marine I have good franchise I don't want to set it up and also like oh my god I have to take all
[9246.46 → 9252.90] my nets down we have to move all the benches I have to set up like tracking and I guess we'd probably
[9252.90 → 9259.34] have to have like an entire fleet of like backpack pcs, and you know peripherals to deploy it would be a
[9259.34 → 9266.18] whole completely different business model uh we do have some cool room scale multiplayer VR stuff
[9266.18 → 9271.40] at whale land, but it's its rolled by a separate company they're just coming in to do like a
[9271.40 → 9276.18] a trial one so they're doing it for free this time, and then they'd want us to pay in the future we're
[9276.18 → 9279.68] going to see how much people like it and if is people are super into it then maybe we'll do it
[9279.68 → 9285.52] again in the future, but we're not going to just turn the entire badminton centre into a VR space because
[9285.52 → 9292.60] and this may be a surprise to a lot of folks out there who don't know that badminton's like kind
[9292.60 → 9299.86] of a big sport, but we're actually getting really busy um every time I show up its full cooking
[9299.86 → 9306.70] baby we're cooking yeah um it was it's its been it was fascinating reading the comments when
[9306.70 → 9313.24] we first announced it uh on YouTube just like hey we got a land centre slash badminton club uh this
[9313.24 → 9319.10] will never work is he joking is it money laundering it's like guys there's a whole wide world out there
[9319.10 → 9326.74] all you have to do to discover it is just open your mind a little bit you'll like it come on in the water's warm
[9326.74 → 9335.24] and last one I've got for you today hello LLD long time watcher first time buyer question is for Luke
[9335.24 → 9341.54] Luke who no wow player housing is coming back before Christmas it's time to come home
[9341.54 → 9348.66] no I don't even care a little bit oh really player housing oh okay I don't know do you like
[9348.66 → 9354.34] you want player housing I don't even know what it is uh so I mean I don't know what their implementation
[9354.34 → 9361.58] is maybe they make it kind of neat but digital mom's basement that would be hilarious uh but
[9361.58 → 9365.06] player housing in games there are a bunch of different implementations for it, but it's like
[9365.06 → 9371.96] MMO obviously wow, but you have a unique house that is yours that you can theoretically customize
[9371.96 → 9378.12] to a certain degree so it's the Sims in a MMO okay I mean maybe you can invite your friends over
[9378.12 → 9384.18] to your house and stuff so it's the Sims, but you have like armour on
[9384.18 → 9392.88] you say that but like you played a lot of wow the armour don't pretend you don't think the armour is
[9392.88 → 9396.50] cool no the armour is really cool why are you trying to be cooler, but that's the problem is the armour is
[9396.50 → 9404.82] way cooler than the house I see yeah the armour is sick wow just being like yeah your shoulder pads
[9404.82 → 9412.86] are just like four times as big as you right that was great okay brilliant so you would be into player
[9412.86 → 9418.68] housing I can't wear the house as long as the door would be wide enough to accommodate your armour
[9418.68 → 9422.56] no because it's kind of a flex when you can't fit through the doors and wow because you're a torrent
[9422.56 → 9428.40] and they weren't built for you, you want a small door so we've had horse armour now we have house armour
[9428.40 → 9432.46] house armour yeah okay so here you are saying you don't care about the house, but then you're like
[9432.46 → 9437.98] actually I really like it when doors are small yeah so you can't really have it both ways here
[9437.98 → 9444.72] Luke your worldview is confusing i just you're not going to get me to come back to wow by adding
[9444.72 → 9451.54] player housing which like MMOs had literally 20 years ago like I'm surprised that they didn't it's
[9451.54 → 9459.74] a good way to extract money what's up jams c AU it's an Au back to jams c nice that was a that was
[9459.74 → 9464.02] the last merch message of the show, and we'll see you guys again next week same bad time same bad channel
[9464.02 → 9468.76] bye there it is jams c
