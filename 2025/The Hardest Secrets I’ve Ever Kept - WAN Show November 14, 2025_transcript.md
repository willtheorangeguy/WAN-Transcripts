[0.00 --> 13.62]  What is up L's and G's welcome to the WAN show we've got oh my god such a good show
[13.62 --> 21.36]  It's actually true actually such a good I have so much stuff that I'm excited to talk to you guys
[21.36 --> 30.16]  About the two big ones are of course valve opened the spigot which is a type of valve yeah and
[30.16 --> 36.36]  Unleashed upon the world if a truly earth-shattering
[36.36 --> 45.06]  Bit of news for poor mr. Luke Lafreniere who just bought a VR headset that is not
[45.06 --> 47.32]  We'll talk about the steam frame
[47.32 --> 55.22]  Also the steam machine the steam controller which we need to talk about the name of
[55.22 --> 59.58]  Okay, we need to talk about the name of the steam controller in other news
[59.58 --> 61.42]  Linus was here
[61.42 --> 65.28]  holy actual shit and
[65.28 --> 73.76]  And Luke got fucked over on that too so hard literally actually on luke lafreniere's birthday
[73.76 --> 81.34]  Yeah, linus came to our studio and luke couldn't be here for it was a way for it to have been avoided
[81.34 --> 88.48]  I don't know anything about that. It was not I don't not your fault. I don't know anything about looking at you. I don't know anything about that
[88.48 --> 89.14]  I'm just saying
[89.14 --> 92.94]  We'll talk about it
[92.94 --> 93.82]  Talk about it
[93.82 --> 103.20]  Microsoft wait wait wait hold on it's the it's the it's the shopping season and so i'm just gonna i'm gonna jump out ahead of things a little bit all right?
[103.20 --> 105.80]  We'll get you more topics, uh, but first
[105.80 --> 108.80]  LTT store comm major focus for us this week
[108.80 --> 112.16]  We've got our buy more save more combo going right now
[112.16 --> 117.66]  Uh, if you buy the more apparel you buy the more discount you get up to 25% off
[117.66 --> 123.94]  We have a holiday loot drop going on right now where if you spend a hundred dollars or more
[123.94 --> 125.94]  You can win a pair of sennheiser hd
[125.94 --> 133.90]  Does that that says 550 I thought it was 560s whatever a pair of sennheiser headphones or if you're really lucky and asus rog xbox ally x
[133.90 --> 134.98]  and
[134.98 --> 137.36]  Hey, we've got new products
[137.36 --> 144.34]  I really like this one including the rgb sweater. Oh my god. We're gonna need a closer look at this
[144.34 --> 146.76]  There you go. You can see the little flex of rgb
[146.76 --> 155.44]  It's 100 cotton knit with tiny multi-knit yarn flex clean polished look great for the office while the colorful specs keep it fun for holiday hangouts
[155.44 --> 159.76]  And we have yes, that's right. We finally have beanies again
[159.76 --> 164.84]  RGB beanies in black and gray in both regular and linus lengths
[164.84 --> 168.56]  There you go. See so if you have a deeper head or if you have a shallower head
[168.56 --> 173.12]  We got you warm cozy and ties right in with the rest of the rgb lineup
[173.12 --> 176.50]  lmg.gg slash rgb. Okay, luke, you got a couple topics
[176.50 --> 180.80]  I do first off, uh, taryn wore that rgb sweater to an event that
[180.80 --> 186.04]  We both went to and I thought it looked really sharp and didn't actually realize it was ours until
[186.04 --> 187.74]  like a
[187.74 --> 193.26]  Day or two ago. Anyways, microsoft exec says windows is evolving into an agentic
[193.26 --> 196.66]  Operating system you picked that and gets it's a week
[196.66 --> 202.34]  No, the reason the reason why I want to talk about the reason why I want to talk about this is because windows is getting
[202.34 --> 203.70]  Dizunked right now
[203.70 --> 206.68]  That's what all of the intro topics are about
[206.68 --> 209.66]  It's valve doing linux stuff and linux guy
[209.66 --> 211.72]  You can't call him linux guy
[211.72 --> 215.60]  That is why he didn't want to meet you. Oh wow
[215.60 --> 223.88]  Speaking of not wanting to meet or something. I don't know. Uh another company that can't stop digging is
[224.68 --> 227.14]  Ubisoft if I can find the topic about it
[227.14 --> 234.42]  Uh, they have delayed their half-year earnings report and requested halted trading until its release which is generally
[234.42 --> 236.60]  a bad sign
[236.60 --> 241.68]  Oh man
[241.68 --> 242.80]  Oh man
[242.80 --> 245.68]  The linux guy
[245.68 --> 249.12]  G'n A man
[249.12 --> 255.22]  How dare you
[255.22 --> 258.62]  The show is brought to you today by
[258.62 --> 259.50]  Vessi
[259.50 --> 260.54]  Odoo
[260.54 --> 266.58]  Corsair and odd pieces alongside of course our wrap partner dbrand our laptop partner del and our chair partner
[266.58 --> 268.36]  Don't you dare secret
[268.36 --> 272.70]  It's upside down, right nice
[272.70 --> 277.02]  What do we want to do for I mean, it's got to be valve
[277.02 --> 279.04]  It's got to be valve dude dude
[279.04 --> 281.28]  This guy was like
[281.28 --> 282.62]  Dying
[282.62 --> 290.48]  Because I saw him the day after the valve event because we were both attending a thing that was farther down the west coast
[290.48 --> 292.56]  But for the first
[292.56 --> 294.50]  Ten hours
[294.50 --> 295.04]  Yep
[295.04 --> 296.38]  We were in mixed company
[296.38 --> 297.36]  So
[297.36 --> 299.02]  And I knew where he was
[299.02 --> 302.90]  And I knew the the potential level of importance of that
[302.90 --> 308.50]  But I I we didn't even have a private moment for me to tell him what was launched
[308.50 --> 310.72]  Basically all I was able to tell him was
[310.72 --> 314.36]  Things we expected also something we didn't expect
[314.36 --> 317.78]  Yeah, which got me most of the way there but not the whole way there
[317.78 --> 319.06]  Yeah, so
[319.06 --> 320.22]  It was
[320.22 --> 324.48]  When we were finally able to sit down at dinner and I was able to like talk him through it
[324.48 --> 324.92]  He's like
[324.92 --> 326.88]  Dude
[326.88 --> 328.78]  This was
[328.78 --> 332.76]  This was the hardware launch of
[332.76 --> 334.34]  I mean
[334.34 --> 337.38]  I feel like this was our Apple Vision Pro
[337.38 --> 341.44]  What was the Apple Vision Pro is like the the the normie people's like whoa interesting
[341.44 --> 342.44]  This is our
[342.44 --> 343.52]  Whoa interesting
[343.52 --> 344.60]  In the VR space
[344.60 --> 347.62]  But I would actually go back even farther than that
[347.62 --> 349.52]  This for your IT
[349.52 --> 350.96]  Computer
[350.96 --> 352.00]  Gamer
[352.00 --> 353.80]  Someone who watches the WAN show
[353.80 --> 354.08]  That
[354.08 --> 355.82]  That demographic right there
[355.82 --> 356.78]  Sure
[356.78 --> 362.26]  This is the most exciting launch since what maybe 30 series
[362.26 --> 364.16]  RTX 30 series
[364.16 --> 365.84]  And when I say 30 series
[365.84 --> 370.64]  I'm not talking the bullshit like pricing that happened afterward with the COVID
[370.64 --> 371.38]  Silicon
[371.38 --> 372.60]  All that stuff
[372.60 --> 374.46]  I'm talking like when it launched
[374.46 --> 376.90]  You probably remember where you were
[376.90 --> 382.22]  When you found out that the RTX 3080 was like 500 bucks or 600 bucks or whatever
[382.22 --> 387.22]  And it was like the performance was huge over the uninspiring 20 series
[387.22 --> 388.18]  Too bad not real
[388.18 --> 389.46]  Like what would
[389.46 --> 389.80]  Yeah
[389.80 --> 391.76]  But we're talking we're talking the initial news right
[391.76 --> 392.04]  Yeah
[392.04 --> 392.78]  Yeah yeah yeah
[392.78 --> 394.62]  The initial news like like can you
[394.62 --> 398.12]  What else what else would qualify here
[398.12 --> 399.22]  Steam Deck was hype
[399.22 --> 401.34]  That was four years ago now
[401.34 --> 403.76]  Like it's been a desert dude
[403.76 --> 408.16]  To me this is more interesting than the initial Steam Deck announcement
[408.16 --> 410.10]  And that might even sound a little bit surprising
[410.10 --> 414.48]  But my reason for that is that this actually came with Steam Deck news
[414.48 --> 416.44]  Kind of as a sidebar thing
[416.44 --> 417.64]  And this to me
[417.64 --> 421.26]  You know we got the indication that this might have been a plan
[421.26 --> 424.48]  Back when they first talked about Steam Machines forever ago
[424.48 --> 428.60]  But this really shows that they're embracing like Valve hardware as an ecosystem
[428.60 --> 431.26]  Which is really cool
[431.26 --> 432.38]  Very exciting
[432.38 --> 436.90]  It's also super exciting that the Steam Machine is coming Linux based with Steam OS
[436.90 --> 442.46]  And it's just like the normalization of people using Linux all the time for things
[442.46 --> 445.22]  Was already pretty big with the Steam Deck
[445.22 --> 449.62]  But now it also being in a Steam Machine for people that just want a console like experience
[449.62 --> 452.10]  Because a bunch of people aren't going to care about handhelds and that's cool
[452.10 --> 454.48]  And a bunch of handheld people won't care about a console experience
[454.48 --> 455.16]  And that's cool too
[455.16 --> 456.08]  And that's also cool
[456.08 --> 457.40]  So now that we have both
[457.40 --> 458.32]  It's just awesome
[458.32 --> 459.02]  It's very exciting
[459.02 --> 489.02] 
[489.02 --> 519.02] 
[519.02 --> 549.02] 
[549.02 --> 551.86]  Like a Quest for instance from Meta
[551.86 --> 554.76]  It's so light
[554.76 --> 556.58]  It's so wearable
[556.58 --> 557.96]  It's so well balanced
[557.96 --> 559.60]  Well balanced is surprisingly important
[559.60 --> 561.18]  With the battery pack at the back
[561.18 --> 565.14]  It's nice and tight to the face thanks to its pancake lenses
[565.14 --> 569.32]  That's actually Valve's justification for using LCDs
[569.32 --> 574.90]  So that they can juice the brightness of the displays enough to overcome the losses from the pancake lenses
[574.90 --> 580.16]  I've only used it for a few minutes at this point
[580.16 --> 583.88]  Because I was really busy writing videos and shooting them and stuff while I was in there
[583.88 --> 586.92]  So I'm going to really need to compare them side by side
[586.92 --> 588.16]  But if I had to guess
[588.16 --> 588.64]  Because
[588.64 --> 590.74]  Yeah
[590.74 --> 596.10]  So dual radios enable concurrent 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi and 6 gigahertz VR streaming
[596.10 --> 597.10]  That's what I understood
[597.10 --> 598.48]  Not what I said from my notes
[598.48 --> 599.44]  Thank you for looking that up
[599.44 --> 600.02]  No problem
[600.02 --> 603.74]  What was I talking about just now?
[604.52 --> 604.84]  Something
[604.84 --> 605.58]  Right LCDs
[605.58 --> 606.64]  So I need to try it
[606.64 --> 609.08]  I need to try this side by side with the big screen beyond 2
[609.08 --> 609.50]  Oh yeah yeah
[609.50 --> 610.94]  Because that's got OLEDs
[610.94 --> 613.36]  But it also has a tether
[613.36 --> 620.52]  So a big part of what Valve is trying to do here is maintain power efficiency for this bloody thing
[620.52 --> 620.76]  Right?
[621.12 --> 626.62]  So I've seen a lot of people push back on Valve's justification for using LCDs
[626.62 --> 632.04]  Saying, well, other VR headsets use pancake lenses and OLED displays
[632.04 --> 632.66]  And it's like, right
[632.66 --> 636.88]  But how much power budget are they using to juice these OLED displays?
[636.90 --> 637.92]  There's also a cost factor
[637.92 --> 638.72]  To overcome it
[638.72 --> 640.26]  There's a cost factor too
[640.26 --> 644.38]  And that was a major concern that I had for the frame
[644.38 --> 647.70]  Because as soon as I hear it's got a computer on it
[647.70 --> 649.14]  I go, great
[649.14 --> 651.28]  A computer I don't care about
[651.28 --> 652.96]  That now I have to buy
[652.96 --> 655.96]  But man, is this thing ever cool
[655.96 --> 657.92]  I might actually care about the computer
[657.92 --> 662.00]  And that is because of the FEX compatibility layer
[662.00 --> 664.36]  That Valve has been contributing to
[664.36 --> 666.16]  In order to speed up the development
[666.16 --> 669.38]  FEX allows you to run x86 games
[669.38 --> 672.30]  On the local ARM CPU
[672.30 --> 674.34]  Which is also running SteamOS
[674.34 --> 678.72]  These guys have been absolutely cooking over there
[678.72 --> 681.30]  Of course
[681.30 --> 683.86]  The most mind-blowing part to me
[683.86 --> 687.92]  Was when I heard about foveated streaming
[687.92 --> 690.22]  So a big concern for me
[690.22 --> 692.26]  As soon as I heard that Project Deckard
[692.26 --> 694.50]  Was going to be a standalone VR headset
[694.50 --> 695.46]  I was like, fuck
[695.46 --> 698.52]  Because Valve was the only one that was left
[698.52 --> 698.88]  Yeah
[698.88 --> 700.58]  That was doing outside-in
[700.58 --> 703.52]  Proper freaking tracking
[703.52 --> 705.20]  That is accurate
[705.20 --> 707.20]  And like
[707.20 --> 709.62]  Just fuck
[709.62 --> 710.20]  Right?
[710.42 --> 711.60]  With a tether
[711.60 --> 713.48]  And high visual fidelity
[713.48 --> 714.80]  You know, everything else
[714.80 --> 715.80]  Apple Vision Pro
[715.80 --> 717.92]  Was going to using wireless streaming
[717.92 --> 718.70]  And the Quest
[718.70 --> 720.26]  Like you can use a wire
[720.26 --> 721.18]  It's flaky
[721.18 --> 722.52]  You can stream wirelessly
[722.52 --> 725.02]  But it's imperfect at best
[725.02 --> 726.80]  And so as soon as I found out
[726.80 --> 727.40]  It was standalone
[727.40 --> 728.72]  I was like, great
[728.72 --> 731.22]  There goes the ecosystem
[731.22 --> 733.26]  For us people who care about
[733.26 --> 734.46]  Accuracy
[734.46 --> 735.74]  And
[735.74 --> 736.94]  Well, yeah
[736.94 --> 737.72]  Accuracy
[737.72 --> 738.48]  Low latency
[738.48 --> 741.50]  I originally fully agreed with you
[741.50 --> 742.94]  And had the exact same reaction
[742.94 --> 743.80]  When I heard about Deckard
[743.80 --> 744.56]  But these days
[744.56 --> 745.34]  With big screen
[745.34 --> 746.74]  I'm less concerned
[746.74 --> 747.84]  Because I feel like
[747.84 --> 749.18]  They can be the champions of that
[749.18 --> 750.08]  Well, we'll get to that
[750.08 --> 750.36]  Okay
[750.36 --> 750.70]  Maybe
[750.70 --> 751.24]  Okay, okay
[751.24 --> 752.04]  Maybe not
[752.04 --> 752.44]  Okay
[752.44 --> 753.36]  But
[753.36 --> 755.04]  When Valve
[755.04 --> 756.52]  Did the demo
[756.52 --> 759.34]  Showing me their wireless streaming
[759.34 --> 761.62]  With foveated streaming
[761.62 --> 762.36]  So
[762.36 --> 763.76]  If you didn't watch the video
[763.76 --> 765.58]  What it basically means
[765.58 --> 768.88]  Is that they are dynamically adjusting
[768.88 --> 770.48]  Their use
[770.48 --> 772.52]  Of the bit rate
[772.52 --> 773.28]  That you have
[773.28 --> 773.50]  Like
[773.50 --> 774.70]  Because your connection
[774.70 --> 775.56]  Your link speed
[775.56 --> 777.64]  Is only whatever it is
[777.64 --> 778.28]  Right
[778.28 --> 779.28]  And so
[779.28 --> 781.18]  By focusing
[781.18 --> 782.42]  Their use
[782.42 --> 783.72]  Of their limited bit rate
[783.72 --> 784.34]  That they have
[784.34 --> 785.12]  Because it's not
[785.12 --> 786.30]  A wired HDMI
[786.30 --> 787.56]  Or DisplayPort connection
[787.56 --> 789.16]  On the areas
[789.16 --> 790.18]  That your eyes
[790.18 --> 791.78]  Are actually looking at
[791.78 --> 793.20]  Actually focused on
[793.20 --> 795.14]  They achieve a level of fidelity
[795.14 --> 796.34]  That admittedly
[796.34 --> 797.48]  I wasn't looking at it
[797.48 --> 798.28]  Side by side
[798.28 --> 800.18]  But that I could not
[800.18 --> 801.16]  Discern
[801.16 --> 802.38]  From a wired connection
[802.38 --> 804.50]  And
[804.50 --> 805.72]  I couldn't
[805.72 --> 806.34]  See
[806.34 --> 807.50]  The
[807.50 --> 807.94]  Like
[807.94 --> 809.50]  I couldn't move my eyes
[809.50 --> 810.24]  Fast enough
[810.24 --> 812.52]  We used a shot
[812.52 --> 813.16]  In the video
[813.16 --> 814.14]  Of me looking around
[814.14 --> 814.68]  Like this
[814.68 --> 815.44]  Which is not
[815.44 --> 816.98]  How you would try to
[816.98 --> 818.04]  Beat it
[818.04 --> 818.62]  Like you would
[818.62 --> 820.16]  Try to flick your eyes
[820.16 --> 821.56]  The time it takes
[821.56 --> 823.22]  For my eyes
[823.22 --> 824.26]  To move to a new spot
[824.26 --> 825.12]  And refocus
[825.12 --> 826.70]  Is slower
[826.70 --> 828.16]  Than the time it takes
[828.16 --> 829.56]  For them to track my pupils
[829.56 --> 831.24]  And reallocate
[831.24 --> 832.72]  Their streaming bit rate budget
[832.72 --> 833.96]  And have that be
[833.96 --> 834.76]  The highest fidelity
[834.76 --> 835.46]  Part of the scene
[835.46 --> 836.06]  I couldn't
[836.06 --> 836.94]  See it Luke
[836.94 --> 838.72]  Crazy
[838.72 --> 839.46]  We'll see
[839.46 --> 840.54]  The proof's gonna be
[840.54 --> 841.72]  In the longer term use
[841.72 --> 843.12]  I was only able to play
[843.12 --> 843.92]  Half-Life Alyx
[843.92 --> 844.72]  Which admittedly
[844.72 --> 846.12]  I didn't enjoy that much
[846.12 --> 847.10]  I didn't really get through it
[847.10 --> 848.12]  I didn't mention that to them
[848.12 --> 848.30]  But
[848.30 --> 851.30]  The other big one
[851.30 --> 852.26]  That I was concerned about
[852.26 --> 853.28]  As someone who
[853.28 --> 854.28]  Has enjoyed
[854.28 --> 855.84]  Full body tracking
[855.84 --> 856.86]  In the past
[856.86 --> 857.92]  Was
[857.92 --> 859.16]  Beat Saber
[859.16 --> 859.78]  So I've
[859.78 --> 860.84]  I've streamed Beat Saber
[860.84 --> 861.64]  With ankle
[861.64 --> 862.70]  And waist trackers
[862.70 --> 863.56]  In addition to my hand
[863.56 --> 864.46]  And head trackers
[864.46 --> 865.62]  And I was
[865.62 --> 866.54]  Really concerned
[866.54 --> 867.38]  About both
[867.38 --> 868.46]  The ability to
[868.46 --> 869.32]  Move my hands
[869.32 --> 870.30]  Fast enough
[870.30 --> 871.36]  Without losing tracking
[871.36 --> 872.84]  Using camera based tracking
[872.84 --> 874.04]  So far
[874.04 --> 875.26]  It looks like
[875.26 --> 876.14]  They have
[876.14 --> 877.76]  Invested heavily enough
[877.76 --> 878.92]  In the onboard processing
[878.92 --> 879.72]  On the controllers
[879.72 --> 881.20]  As well as
[881.20 --> 882.88]  In quality
[882.88 --> 884.46]  Quality inside out
[884.46 --> 885.28]  Tracking cameras
[885.28 --> 885.94]  And the positioning
[885.94 --> 886.46]  Is such that
[886.46 --> 887.64]  You can get pretty far back
[887.64 --> 888.56]  Before you actually
[888.56 --> 889.14]  Lose tracking
[889.14 --> 889.72]  That it looks like
[889.72 --> 890.56]  That won't be an issue
[890.56 --> 891.56]  As for whether
[891.56 --> 892.76]  You can use base stations
[892.76 --> 894.20]  With your older
[894.20 --> 895.40]  Tracker devices
[895.40 --> 896.70]  I've seen quite a few
[896.70 --> 897.72]  People ask about that
[897.72 --> 898.52]  I don't know yet
[898.52 --> 899.54]  But that is gonna be
[899.54 --> 900.52]  One of the first things
[900.52 --> 901.52]  That I'm gonna try
[901.52 --> 902.88]  Once I have a frame
[902.88 --> 904.36]  In hand
[904.36 --> 905.66]  So like
[905.66 --> 906.86]  This thing is wild
[906.86 --> 907.72]  It's so
[907.72 --> 909.04]  It's the versatility
[909.04 --> 910.40]  The fact that I can get
[910.40 --> 911.92]  As far as I can tell
[911.92 --> 913.86]  I wouldn't say
[913.86 --> 915.40]  Zero compromises
[915.40 --> 916.60]  Because it isn't an OLED
[916.60 --> 919.14]  But a low compromise
[919.14 --> 921.26]  PC VR experience
[921.26 --> 922.36]  Now
[922.36 --> 923.62]  With no tether
[923.62 --> 924.98]  Wow
[924.98 --> 927.72]  The fact that I can run games
[927.72 --> 928.72]  Locally
[928.72 --> 929.88]  On this thing
[929.88 --> 930.82]  Right
[930.82 --> 931.78]  Lighter games
[931.78 --> 932.50]  Obviously
[932.50 --> 933.62]  VR titles
[933.62 --> 934.52]  And play those
[934.52 --> 935.70]  Is wow
[935.70 --> 936.80]  And then the fact
[936.80 --> 937.76]  That I can play
[937.76 --> 938.90]  Everything from
[938.90 --> 939.50]  Like
[939.50 --> 940.66]  Literal
[940.66 --> 941.04]  Like
[941.04 --> 942.64]  PC games
[942.64 --> 943.36]  To media
[943.36 --> 945.32]  On just a giant screen
[945.32 --> 946.70]  Like I might do
[946.70 --> 947.36]  With something like
[947.36 --> 948.44]  An Apple Vision Pro
[948.44 --> 949.76]  Is
[949.76 --> 950.88]  Triple wow
[950.88 --> 951.46]  Like it's
[951.46 --> 952.12]  It's
[952.12 --> 953.26]  It's awesome
[953.26 --> 954.12]  And literally
[954.12 --> 955.10]  Every criticism
[955.10 --> 955.88]  That I've seen
[955.88 --> 956.58]  Of it so far
[956.58 --> 958.12]  I either
[958.12 --> 960.24]  Fully understand
[960.24 --> 961.24]  Why Valve
[961.24 --> 961.90]  Made the choice
[961.90 --> 962.58]  That they did
[962.58 --> 963.90]  And I can
[963.90 --> 964.52]  And I can
[964.52 --> 965.18]  I can
[965.18 --> 966.34]  I can agree
[966.34 --> 967.30]  With their justification
[967.30 --> 968.72]  Even if I might have
[968.72 --> 969.32]  Done it differently
[969.32 --> 971.20]  Or I think the criticism
[971.20 --> 972.68]  Is just frankly stupid
[972.68 --> 974.78]  Like man
[974.78 --> 977.44]  I don't understand
[977.44 --> 978.46]  How in the year
[978.46 --> 979.34]  And I'm about to
[979.34 --> 980.24]  Offend some people
[980.24 --> 980.64]  I think
[980.64 --> 982.02]  But I don't understand
[982.02 --> 982.76]  How in the year
[982.76 --> 983.42]  2025
[983.42 --> 984.82]  You can somehow
[984.82 --> 985.74]  Not be aware
[985.74 --> 986.58]  Of nickel metal
[986.58 --> 987.26]  Hydride
[987.26 --> 988.52]  Double A cells
[988.52 --> 989.96]  Oh I
[989.96 --> 991.48]  I can definitely
[991.48 --> 992.00]  Imagine
[992.00 --> 992.74]  How
[992.74 --> 993.84]  How
[993.84 --> 997.90]  How would most people
[997.90 --> 999.18]  Outside of this
[999.18 --> 1000.38]  This group
[1000.38 --> 1001.42]  That's watching this
[1001.42 --> 1002.60]  Or other similar content
[1002.60 --> 1003.76]  Have ran into that
[1003.76 --> 1004.74]  Because
[1004.74 --> 1006.82]  Disposable batteries
[1006.82 --> 1007.36]  Are so
[1007.36 --> 1008.62]  F***ing expensive
[1008.62 --> 1009.52]  You'd think they'd
[1009.52 --> 1010.56]  Look for an alternative
[1010.56 --> 1011.54]  I don't think
[1011.54 --> 1012.22]  A lot of people
[1012.22 --> 1012.80]  Run into
[1012.80 --> 1013.96]  Disposable batteries
[1013.96 --> 1014.74]  In their
[1014.74 --> 1015.62]  Day to day
[1015.62 --> 1016.06]  Dude
[1016.06 --> 1017.60]  You been to a Costco
[1017.60 --> 1018.02]  Lately
[1018.02 --> 1019.28]  You see how big
[1019.28 --> 1020.00]  The pallets
[1020.00 --> 1020.92]  Of disposable batteries
[1020.92 --> 1021.08]  Are
[1021.08 --> 1021.78]  People are buying
[1021.78 --> 1022.48]  The crap out of
[1022.48 --> 1022.90]  These things
[1022.90 --> 1023.74]  And all they had
[1023.74 --> 1024.16]  To do
[1024.16 --> 1025.44]  Is go buy like
[1025.44 --> 1026.36]  Eight N loops
[1026.36 --> 1027.34]  And a charger
[1027.34 --> 1028.28]  And then never
[1028.28 --> 1028.98]  Buy one again
[1028.98 --> 1030.70]  Are grabbing the ones
[1030.70 --> 1031.76]  At Costco
[1031.76 --> 1033.06]  Or grabbing the pack
[1033.06 --> 1034.08]  From like Ikea
[1034.08 --> 1034.98]  And just not thinking
[1034.98 --> 1035.66]  About it ever
[1035.66 --> 1037.00]  Because they throw it
[1037.00 --> 1037.66]  In their TV remote
[1037.66 --> 1038.16]  And then it lasts
[1038.16 --> 1038.90]  For like two years
[1038.90 --> 1039.74]  Or longer
[1039.74 --> 1040.66]  But
[1040.66 --> 1041.96]  Double A's go in
[1041.96 --> 1043.20]  All kinds of things
[1043.20 --> 1046.76]  Kids toys
[1046.76 --> 1048.48]  Xbox controllers
[1048.48 --> 1048.66]  Not kids toys
[1048.66 --> 1050.84]  Adult toys
[1050.84 --> 1051.62]  Yeah
[1051.62 --> 1052.66]  Exactly
[1052.66 --> 1054.88]  Get
[1054.88 --> 1056.50]  Maybe people just
[1056.50 --> 1057.28]  Aren't being super
[1057.28 --> 1058.16]  Economical about
[1058.16 --> 1059.02]  Their adults toys
[1059.02 --> 1059.98]  It's just
[1059.98 --> 1060.88]  Use them less
[1060.88 --> 1062.56]  Dude it's wild to me
[1062.56 --> 1063.42]  Like you can
[1063.42 --> 1063.74]  Yeah
[1063.74 --> 1065.06]  Okay so one person
[1065.06 --> 1066.08]  One person here says
[1066.08 --> 1066.92]  Yeah the disposables
[1066.92 --> 1068.00]  Last longer in the device
[1068.00 --> 1069.14]  Like my god
[1069.14 --> 1069.82]  Who cares
[1069.82 --> 1071.50]  Yes it's a little bit longer
[1071.50 --> 1073.38]  But literally
[1073.38 --> 1074.84]  If you factor in the time
[1074.84 --> 1076.22]  To walk down the aisle
[1076.22 --> 1077.40]  And go get the stupid
[1077.40 --> 1078.08]  Batteries
[1078.08 --> 1078.60]  You've already
[1078.60 --> 1079.48]  Accounted for
[1079.48 --> 1080.26]  The extra time
[1080.26 --> 1080.82]  That you'll use
[1080.82 --> 1081.98]  Changing the batteries
[1081.98 --> 1083.08]  Slightly more often
[1083.08 --> 1084.18]  Like it really
[1084.18 --> 1085.98]  Is not that big of a deal
[1085.98 --> 1087.30]  Especially in low usage
[1087.30 --> 1087.72]  Devices
[1087.72 --> 1088.22]  I think just won't do all that care man
[1088.22 --> 1090.22]  But they're so expensive
[1090.22 --> 1092.06]  Buy one
[1092.06 --> 1092.36]  Dude
[1092.36 --> 1093.10]  I have
[1093.10 --> 1094.04]  Eneloops in my house
[1094.04 --> 1095.34]  That I've had for ten years
[1095.34 --> 1095.76]  Oh yeah
[1095.76 --> 1096.60]  That have been
[1096.60 --> 1097.30]  Probably longer
[1097.30 --> 1099.32]  Probably 50 recharge cycles
[1099.32 --> 1100.70]  They still work
[1100.70 --> 1103.02]  Like can people just not
[1103.02 --> 1103.68]  Throw
[1103.68 --> 1105.34]  Literally throw away money
[1105.34 --> 1107.76]  Like this is for your own good
[1107.76 --> 1111.20]  Go buy some nickel metal hydride batteries
[1111.20 --> 1113.76]  What?
[1114.98 --> 1116.38]  Why is this funny?
[1117.26 --> 1117.74]  It's just
[1117.74 --> 1118.76]  That whole sentence
[1118.76 --> 1121.06]  Go buy some nickel batteries
[1121.06 --> 1122.64]  It's just such a funny sentence
[1122.64 --> 1123.48]  We don't even offer them
[1123.48 --> 1124.20]  Not from us
[1124.20 --> 1125.22]  Just buy it from someone
[1125.22 --> 1126.12]  It's just really funny
[1126.12 --> 1126.66]  I'm sorry
[1126.66 --> 1130.32]  Twitch chat's gonna lose
[1130.32 --> 1131.46]  I don't disagree with you
[1131.46 --> 1132.48]  Twitch is gonna lose
[1132.48 --> 1133.22]  Their chat privileges
[1133.22 --> 1134.00]  Pretty quick here
[1134.00 --> 1134.72]  Juraçao will never
[1134.72 --> 1135.60]  Sponsor us again
[1135.60 --> 1136.48]  I don't even disagree with you
[1136.48 --> 1137.08]  Linus do you know
[1137.08 --> 1137.92]  What's expensive?
[1138.28 --> 1139.06]  Rechargeable batteries
[1139.06 --> 1140.18]  Yeah one time
[1140.18 --> 1142.46]  One time
[1142.46 --> 1143.04]  Buy once
[1143.04 --> 1143.68]  Cry once
[1143.68 --> 1144.24]  Yes
[1144.24 --> 1146.22]  You can recharge it
[1146.22 --> 1147.32]  Like 50 times
[1147.32 --> 1148.72]  A hundred times
[1148.72 --> 1149.90]  Do they cost
[1149.90 --> 1151.12]  50 times as much?
[1152.44 --> 1153.32]  I'll let you do the
[1153.32 --> 1153.78]  Actually no
[1153.78 --> 1154.52]  I'm not gonna let you
[1154.52 --> 1154.90]  Do the math
[1154.90 --> 1155.56]  Because you're a
[1155.56 --> 1156.24]  F***ing idiot
[1156.24 --> 1157.56]  No
[1157.56 --> 1158.42]  They don't
[1158.42 --> 1159.90]  Cost 50 times as much
[1159.90 --> 1162.22]  Go buy rechargeable batteries
[1162.22 --> 1164.02]  You can thank me later
[1164.02 --> 1165.80]  We're losing
[1165.80 --> 1166.38]  Elijah
[1166.38 --> 1169.74]  That's so mad
[1169.74 --> 1172.22]  First time
[1172.22 --> 1174.62]  Dying here man
[1174.62 --> 1175.02]  I mean I generally
[1175.02 --> 1176.10]  Pretty much agree with all that
[1176.10 --> 1177.14]  The only thing I don't agree with
[1177.14 --> 1177.54]  Is like
[1177.54 --> 1179.22]  How do people not realize it
[1179.22 --> 1180.22]  Like I mean
[1180.22 --> 1181.02]  It's pretty obvious
[1181.02 --> 1185.34]  Consumers man
[1185.34 --> 1185.84]  Linus
[1185.84 --> 1187.14]  At the stores
[1187.14 --> 1187.94]  They're shopping at
[1187.94 --> 1188.56]  In a lot of cases
[1188.56 --> 1189.50]  They're just not there
[1189.50 --> 1190.60]  Linus just forgets
[1190.60 --> 1191.64]  That he's the smartest person
[1191.64 --> 1192.52]  In the room at all times
[1192.52 --> 1192.86]  So
[1192.86 --> 1194.90]  He's just so overwhelmingly intelligent
[1194.90 --> 1195.80]  That's the problem
[1195.80 --> 1196.86]  I'm not that smart
[1196.86 --> 1200.36]  I hate being the smartest person
[1200.36 --> 1200.80]  In a room
[1200.80 --> 1201.68]  It's a really hard time
[1201.68 --> 1202.28]  Buying helmets
[1202.28 --> 1203.30]  Have you tried huffing
[1203.30 --> 1204.48]  Paint more often?
[1205.16 --> 1206.66]  That sounds like a good hobby
[1206.66 --> 1207.74]  For someone like you
[1207.74 --> 1208.86]  Good Friday night
[1208.86 --> 1211.32]  I know what I'm doing
[1211.32 --> 1212.02]  After the show
[1212.02 --> 1213.18]  To deal with Twitch chat
[1213.18 --> 1214.02]  I'm dying guys
[1214.02 --> 1215.56]  Now to be clear
[1215.56 --> 1216.76]  To be clear
[1216.76 --> 1217.48]  To be clear
[1217.48 --> 1219.12]  There are situations
[1219.12 --> 1219.88]  Where an alkaline
[1219.88 --> 1220.62]  Makes more sense
[1220.62 --> 1221.72]  So for
[1221.72 --> 1223.02]  Like I keep alkalines
[1223.02 --> 1223.80]  In my house as well
[1223.80 --> 1225.28]  So for instance
[1225.28 --> 1230.46]  For instance
[1230.46 --> 1231.66]  Oh my god
[1231.66 --> 1233.04]  This is going all over reddit
[1233.04 --> 1234.50]  Low end kids toys
[1234.50 --> 1235.72]  I will tip
[1235.72 --> 1236.14]  I'll tip
[1236.14 --> 1237.46]  Can
[1237.46 --> 1238.00]  Can I
[1238.00 --> 1238.92]  Can I talk
[1238.92 --> 1240.42]  I feel like you
[1240.42 --> 1242.64]  Can I just talk
[1242.64 --> 1243.64]  Without being interrupted
[1243.64 --> 1245.42]  I'm not even saying anything
[1245.42 --> 1247.54]  Your judgment
[1247.54 --> 1248.92]  Speaks very loudly
[1248.92 --> 1252.00]  I can't believe
[1252.00 --> 1252.88]  You would give a horrible
[1252.88 --> 1253.94]  Experience to your children
[1253.94 --> 1254.44]  It's not
[1254.44 --> 1256.58]  Ruining the next generation
[1256.58 --> 1257.90]  So for low end kids toys
[1257.90 --> 1258.56]  Where I think
[1258.56 --> 1259.52]  It's very likely
[1259.52 --> 1260.60]  That we're going to end up
[1260.60 --> 1261.54]  Like donating it
[1261.54 --> 1262.82]  Before it would even
[1262.82 --> 1263.90]  Run through an entire
[1263.90 --> 1264.64]  Battery cycle
[1264.64 --> 1265.62]  I don't want to risk
[1265.62 --> 1266.48]  Losing my expensive
[1266.48 --> 1267.72]  Rechargeable batteries
[1267.72 --> 1269.16]  So there are situations
[1269.16 --> 1270.32]  Where I'll throw an alkaline
[1270.32 --> 1270.98]  Into something
[1270.98 --> 1272.26]  Because I'm just like
[1272.26 --> 1272.60]  Yeah
[1272.60 --> 1274.32]  This is very likely
[1274.32 --> 1275.08]  To be lost
[1275.08 --> 1276.00]  Because like
[1276.00 --> 1277.32]  For certain toys
[1277.32 --> 1278.54]  It literally will double
[1278.54 --> 1280.18]  Like the value of that thing
[1280.18 --> 1280.86]  If you put a couple
[1280.86 --> 1282.08]  Rechargeable batteries in it
[1282.08 --> 1282.68]  Like I'd not
[1282.68 --> 1283.44]  Not forget it
[1283.44 --> 1284.08]  I'll throw an alkaline
[1284.08 --> 1284.42]  In there
[1284.42 --> 1285.00]  But
[1285.00 --> 1286.90]  And there are devices
[1286.90 --> 1288.46]  Particularly like
[1288.46 --> 1289.64]  Super high draw ones
[1289.64 --> 1291.08]  That actually don't run
[1291.08 --> 1292.24]  Properly on rechargeables
[1292.24 --> 1293.72]  There are devices
[1293.72 --> 1295.66]  That don't respond well
[1295.66 --> 1297.02]  To the lower voltage range
[1297.02 --> 1298.20]  Of rechargeable batteries
[1298.20 --> 1300.20]  Sorry
[1300.20 --> 1301.48]  Not you
[1301.48 --> 1304.44]  You're going to lose
[1304.44 --> 1305.24]  Your chat privileges
[1305.24 --> 1306.54]  You're going to lose
[1306.54 --> 1307.42]  Your chat privileges
[1307.42 --> 1309.68]  You're going to lose
[1309.68 --> 1310.82]  Your chat privileges
[1310.82 --> 1311.56]  All of you
[1311.56 --> 1312.94]  I have to moderate
[1312.94 --> 1315.94]  I have to read them
[1315.94 --> 1318.20]  Now you're stuck
[1318.20 --> 1318.86]  With them too
[1318.86 --> 1319.88]  This is what it's like
[1319.88 --> 1320.60]  Every Friday
[1320.60 --> 1321.32]  Slow the cards are really funny
[1321.32 --> 1322.80]  There's also a lot of names
[1322.80 --> 1323.40]  From Flowplane
[1323.40 --> 1324.08]  That are hanging out
[1324.08 --> 1325.40]  Yeah
[1325.40 --> 1325.88]  Sorry about the chat
[1325.88 --> 1327.38]  I reduced slow mode as well
[1327.38 --> 1328.32]  Just to make it worse
[1328.32 --> 1329.26]  On everyone
[1329.26 --> 1329.96]  Okay
[1329.96 --> 1330.42]  Look
[1330.42 --> 1330.72]  Nice
[1330.72 --> 1331.52]  The point is
[1331.52 --> 1333.08]  Oh
[1333.08 --> 1333.82]  Flowping chat is back
[1333.82 --> 1335.20]  That one of the
[1335.20 --> 1336.18]  Biggest criticisms
[1336.18 --> 1338.56]  I'm coming back on topic here
[1338.56 --> 1339.24]  One of the
[1339.24 --> 1340.46]  Oh cool
[1340.46 --> 1341.82]  You know what
[1341.82 --> 1343.18]  Twitch chat hasn't lost
[1343.18 --> 1344.10]  Their privileges yet
[1344.10 --> 1346.64]  They can keep it for now
[1346.64 --> 1349.50]  The problem is
[1349.50 --> 1350.06]  Sorry
[1350.06 --> 1351.20]  The biggest complaint
[1351.20 --> 1351.90]  That I've seen
[1351.90 --> 1352.70]  About the frame
[1352.70 --> 1354.00]  Is the AA battery
[1354.00 --> 1354.78]  In the controllers
[1354.78 --> 1356.48]  And that
[1356.48 --> 1357.86]  Was pretty wild to me
[1357.86 --> 1358.76]  Especially as someone
[1358.76 --> 1360.22]  Who has knuckles controllers
[1360.22 --> 1361.10]  And an index
[1361.10 --> 1362.64]  And has experienced
[1362.64 --> 1363.64]  Forgetting to charge
[1363.64 --> 1365.06]  The integrated lithium battery
[1365.06 --> 1366.52]  And then had to like
[1366.52 --> 1368.08]  Charge for 10 minutes
[1368.08 --> 1369.42]  Play for 15 minutes
[1369.42 --> 1370.24]  Charge for 10 minutes
[1370.24 --> 1371.14]  Play for 15 minutes
[1371.14 --> 1371.88]  Like that is not
[1371.88 --> 1372.64]  A better experience
[1372.64 --> 1373.34]  Than just
[1373.34 --> 1374.78]  Having a little
[1374.78 --> 1376.26]  Quad cell charger
[1376.26 --> 1377.56]  Somewhere near your VR headset
[1377.56 --> 1379.10]  And then just
[1379.10 --> 1380.30]  Popping your dead battery
[1380.30 --> 1380.88]  Into it
[1380.88 --> 1382.46]  Grabbing a freshly charged one
[1382.46 --> 1383.52]  Popping it into the controller
[1383.52 --> 1384.46]  And then being ready to go
[1384.46 --> 1385.20]  For another full
[1385.20 --> 1385.98]  Charge cycle
[1385.98 --> 1387.40]  It is
[1387.40 --> 1387.94]  It is
[1387.94 --> 1389.56]  Actually
[1389.56 --> 1390.60]  Objectively
[1390.60 --> 1392.40]  Faster to get back up
[1392.40 --> 1392.78]  And running
[1392.78 --> 1393.66]  And
[1393.66 --> 1394.62]  The weight
[1394.62 --> 1395.78]  Of a AA cell
[1395.78 --> 1396.06]  Yeah
[1396.06 --> 1396.88]  I can see people
[1396.88 --> 1397.96]  Not being that into it
[1397.96 --> 1399.70]  Because they have to have
[1399.70 --> 1400.76]  Like a big metal housing
[1400.76 --> 1401.28]  Around them
[1401.28 --> 1402.02]  Compared to
[1402.02 --> 1403.00]  Like a
[1403.00 --> 1404.08]  Compared to just like
[1404.08 --> 1404.92]  A pack style
[1404.92 --> 1405.74]  Lithium battery
[1405.74 --> 1407.92]  Excuse me
[1407.92 --> 1408.54]  Pouch style
[1408.54 --> 1409.00]  Was the word
[1409.00 --> 1409.80]  I was looking for
[1409.80 --> 1411.12]  Yeah
[1411.12 --> 1411.62]  I don't love
[1411.62 --> 1412.50]  Having the extra weight
[1412.50 --> 1413.54]  But for the convenience
[1413.54 --> 1414.18]  Of being able to
[1414.18 --> 1415.20]  Quickly swap a battery
[1415.20 --> 1416.10]  I think it is
[1416.10 --> 1417.48]  Well worth it
[1417.48 --> 1418.34]  And it is
[1418.34 --> 1419.06]  I mean
[1419.06 --> 1419.78]  Let's face it
[1419.78 --> 1420.62]  This thing is not
[1420.62 --> 1421.26]  Going to be cheap
[1421.26 --> 1422.54]  Is there a
[1422.54 --> 1423.48]  Price out there
[1423.48 --> 1424.62]  Is there a price out there
[1424.62 --> 1425.50]  On any of this
[1425.50 --> 1426.16]  No
[1426.16 --> 1428.30]  But Valve did
[1428.30 --> 1429.88]  Make some nudges
[1429.88 --> 1430.58]  Some indications
[1430.58 --> 1431.20]  Yeah
[1431.20 --> 1433.32]  They did indicate
[1433.32 --> 1435.46]  Sort of what they were targeting
[1435.46 --> 1436.44]  And I think the goal
[1436.44 --> 1437.36]  Was for it to be
[1437.36 --> 1438.60]  Not more expensive
[1438.60 --> 1439.38]  Than Index
[1439.38 --> 1441.28]  So the headset
[1441.28 --> 1441.90]  Itself
[1441.90 --> 1444.06]  Is loaded up
[1444.06 --> 1444.76]  To the gills
[1444.76 --> 1446.22]  With expensive tech
[1446.22 --> 1447.66]  But you don't need
[1447.66 --> 1448.32]  Base stations
[1448.32 --> 1449.54]  So that
[1449.54 --> 1450.32]  Helps
[1450.32 --> 1451.06]  I guess
[1451.06 --> 1452.10]  And then we'll see
[1452.10 --> 1452.92]  Where the chips fall
[1452.92 --> 1453.64]  In terms of pricing
[1453.64 --> 1454.72]  But I wouldn't be surprised
[1454.72 --> 1455.22]  To see
[1455.22 --> 1456.28]  $9.99
[1456.28 --> 1457.30]  I wouldn't be surprised
[1457.30 --> 1458.26]  To see the same price
[1458.26 --> 1459.50]  As an index
[1459.50 --> 1461.74]  Or rather
[1461.74 --> 1462.48]  Shoot
[1462.48 --> 1463.12]  What's the index
[1463.12 --> 1463.62]  What's the index
[1463.62 --> 1464.44]  Go for in the states
[1464.44 --> 1466.14]  Index price
[1466.14 --> 1466.90]  In USD
[1466.90 --> 1468.80]  Oh shoot
[1468.80 --> 1469.08]  Yeah
[1469.08 --> 1469.58]  You have to say
[1469.58 --> 1470.20]  Valve index
[1470.20 --> 1470.86]  Otherwise you just
[1470.86 --> 1471.62]  End up with all kinds
[1471.62 --> 1472.18]  Of other things
[1472.18 --> 1473.16]  $9.99
[1473.16 --> 1473.68]  $9.99
[1473.68 --> 1474.02]  Okay
[1474.02 --> 1474.58]  For the kit
[1474.58 --> 1475.52]  I did get that right
[1475.52 --> 1475.90]  Okay
[1475.90 --> 1477.52]  But I mean
[1477.52 --> 1477.78]  Essentially
[1477.78 --> 1478.52]  Just the headset
[1478.52 --> 1479.76]  Is $6.59
[1479.76 --> 1480.56]  But you're not
[1480.56 --> 1480.84]  Going to be able
[1480.84 --> 1481.34]  To buy this
[1481.34 --> 1482.14]  Without the kit
[1482.14 --> 1482.56]  So
[1482.56 --> 1483.12]  The headset
[1483.12 --> 1483.70]  And controllers
[1483.70 --> 1484.16]  Is
[1484.16 --> 1485.04]  Oh wait
[1485.04 --> 1485.82]  What
[1485.82 --> 1489.46]  Oh
[1489.46 --> 1490.80]  What's that
[1490.80 --> 1491.28]  If you want
[1491.28 --> 1492.32]  The whole thing
[1492.32 --> 1492.88]  So headset
[1492.88 --> 1493.40]  Controllers
[1493.40 --> 1494.10]  Base stations
[1494.10 --> 1495.64]  All that
[1495.64 --> 1496.64]  It's
[1496.64 --> 1498.14]  $13.19
[1498.14 --> 1498.72]  Oh
[1498.72 --> 1499.08]  Canadian
[1499.08 --> 1499.44]  Yeah
[1499.44 --> 1499.72]  Canadian
[1499.72 --> 1500.22]  So that's
[1500.22 --> 1500.86]  That's a grand
[1500.86 --> 1501.18]  Yeah
[1501.18 --> 1501.74]  Okay
[1501.74 --> 1503.68]  Alright
[1503.68 --> 1506.72]  What are we even
[1506.72 --> 1507.34]  Oh yeah
[1507.34 --> 1507.58]  Wow
[1507.58 --> 1508.18]  We're still talking
[1508.18 --> 1508.72]  About the valve
[1508.72 --> 1509.28]  Announcements
[1509.28 --> 1510.02]  Sure are
[1510.02 --> 1510.24]  Yeah
[1510.24 --> 1510.90]  Elijah's never
[1510.90 --> 1511.42]  Going home
[1511.42 --> 1511.92]  He's actually
[1511.92 --> 1512.46]  Here to talk
[1512.46 --> 1513.14]  About the other
[1513.14 --> 1513.62]  Big news
[1513.62 --> 1514.26]  From this week
[1514.26 --> 1515.28]  Sure is
[1515.28 --> 1516.00]  Linus X
[1516.00 --> 1516.56]  Linus
[1516.56 --> 1517.50]  Um
[1517.50 --> 1519.90]  But I mean
[1519.90 --> 1520.60]  We can't move on
[1520.60 --> 1521.14]  From the frame
[1521.14 --> 1521.76]  Without talking
[1521.76 --> 1522.86]  About how much
[1522.86 --> 1523.78]  Buyer's remorse
[1523.78 --> 1524.38]  You must be
[1524.38 --> 1525.22]  Feeling right now
[1525.22 --> 1525.96]  I don't know
[1525.96 --> 1527.76]  So he just
[1527.76 --> 1528.36]  I don't know
[1528.36 --> 1529.36]  Like two months ago
[1529.36 --> 1530.90]  Bought a big screen
[1530.90 --> 1531.64]  Beyond 2
[1531.64 --> 1532.66]  Oh I bought it
[1532.66 --> 1533.10]  Before then
[1533.10 --> 1534.14]  I just received it
[1534.14 --> 1534.82]  Somewhere around there
[1534.82 --> 1535.92]  Have you fired it up yet
[1535.92 --> 1536.92]  No I still don't have
[1536.92 --> 1537.52]  A functional
[1537.52 --> 1539.34]  Uh dwelling
[1539.34 --> 1541.14]  So by the time
[1541.14 --> 1542.18]  You actually get to
[1542.18 --> 1543.20]  Use your big screen
[1543.20 --> 1543.90]  Beyond 2
[1543.90 --> 1544.78]  It might be
[1544.78 --> 1545.32]  Uh
[1545.32 --> 1546.30]  Halfway through
[1546.30 --> 1546.96]  2026
[1546.96 --> 1547.38]  We'll see
[1547.38 --> 1547.96]  The frame
[1547.96 --> 1548.26]  What
[1548.26 --> 1549.02]  I'm kidding
[1549.02 --> 1549.74]  Oh okay
[1549.74 --> 1550.32]  The frame
[1550.32 --> 1551.54]  The frame
[1551.54 --> 1552.72]  Could literally be
[1552.72 --> 1553.80]  Like imminently
[1553.80 --> 1554.42]  Available
[1554.42 --> 1555.68]  Oh yeah
[1555.68 --> 1556.36]  How do you feel
[1556.36 --> 1557.14]  About that sir
[1557.14 --> 1557.96]  I don't know
[1557.96 --> 1559.88]  That is such a
[1559.88 --> 1560.10]  That
[1560.10 --> 1561.34]  This is a podcast
[1561.34 --> 1561.82]  The big screen
[1561.82 --> 1562.40]  Beyond is still
[1562.40 --> 1563.18]  Really cool
[1563.18 --> 1563.86]  You can't just say
[1563.86 --> 1564.54]  I don't know
[1564.54 --> 1565.08]  The big screen
[1565.08 --> 1565.56]  Beyond is still
[1565.56 --> 1566.06]  Really cool
[1566.06 --> 1567.32]  I don't know
[1567.32 --> 1567.92]  How much regret
[1567.92 --> 1568.62]  I'm gonna feel
[1568.62 --> 1569.90]  I feel like
[1569.90 --> 1570.70]  I actually might
[1570.70 --> 1571.28]  End up with
[1571.28 --> 1571.90]  Both of them
[1571.90 --> 1572.52]  Which might sound
[1572.52 --> 1572.92]  Insane
[1572.92 --> 1575.04]  Oh I was
[1575.04 --> 1575.54]  I was gonna
[1575.54 --> 1576.38]  I was about
[1576.38 --> 1577.02]  To make a joke
[1577.02 --> 1577.48]  About how
[1577.48 --> 1578.14]  The regret
[1578.14 --> 1578.44]  Could be
[1578.44 --> 1578.70]  Kind of
[1578.70 --> 1579.32]  Tugging on you
[1579.32 --> 1579.84]  A little bit
[1579.84 --> 1580.16]  Something
[1580.16 --> 1582.24]  Because honestly
[1582.24 --> 1582.70]  That's
[1582.70 --> 1583.28]  I think that's
[1583.28 --> 1584.06]  The biggest downside
[1584.06 --> 1585.54]  There are still
[1585.54 --> 1586.46]  Advantages
[1586.46 --> 1587.60]  To the Beyond 2
[1587.60 --> 1589.22]  OLED displays
[1589.22 --> 1589.60]  Yes
[1589.60 --> 1590.60]  It is
[1590.60 --> 1591.28]  Smaller
[1591.28 --> 1592.12]  And lighter
[1592.12 --> 1592.54]  Yep
[1592.54 --> 1593.76]  Better light seal
[1593.76 --> 1595.68]  Because it's bespoke
[1595.68 --> 1596.56]  The light seal is
[1596.56 --> 1597.80]  Incredible
[1597.80 --> 1598.68]  Literally perfect
[1598.68 --> 1599.08]  Yeah
[1599.08 --> 1600.14]  Literally perfect
[1600.14 --> 1601.56]  Very comfortable
[1601.56 --> 1602.04]  As well
[1602.04 --> 1603.98]  Yeah
[1603.98 --> 1604.74]  I don't know
[1604.74 --> 1605.24]  If it's as good
[1605.24 --> 1605.52]  As the
[1605.52 --> 1606.02]  Oh
[1606.02 --> 1606.80]  Yeah
[1606.80 --> 1607.68]  Tough
[1607.68 --> 1608.94]  Depends on how long
[1608.94 --> 1609.52]  You're wearing it
[1609.52 --> 1610.22]  Have you actually
[1610.22 --> 1611.12]  Worn it for like
[1611.12 --> 1612.08]  Doing anything physical
[1612.08 --> 1612.68]  No
[1612.68 --> 1613.46]  So the Beyond
[1613.46 --> 1614.48]  Because it has
[1614.48 --> 1615.52]  It has like a
[1615.52 --> 1616.76]  Rubbery type of
[1616.76 --> 1617.12]  Material
[1617.12 --> 1617.70]  Like a silicone
[1617.70 --> 1618.68]  It's still literally
[1618.68 --> 1619.24]  Here
[1619.24 --> 1619.54]  Yeah
[1619.54 --> 1620.34]  In a box
[1620.34 --> 1620.98]  On my desk
[1620.98 --> 1621.62]  I'm so sorry
[1621.62 --> 1622.94]  Because it uses
[1622.94 --> 1623.64]  That material
[1623.64 --> 1624.40]  You end up with
[1624.40 --> 1624.92]  What I call
[1624.92 --> 1625.64]  Swamp eye
[1625.64 --> 1626.82]  A little bit
[1626.82 --> 1627.52]  Because it's not
[1627.52 --> 1628.16]  Breathable
[1628.16 --> 1628.48]  Yeah
[1628.48 --> 1628.70]  Yeah
[1628.70 --> 1628.88]  Yeah
[1628.88 --> 1629.06]  Yeah
[1629.06 --> 1630.42]  Whereas the deck
[1630.42 --> 1631.32]  Uses a more
[1631.32 --> 1632.36]  A more breathable
[1632.36 --> 1633.02]  Style material
[1633.02 --> 1633.82]  And it has like
[1633.82 --> 1634.26]  Gaps
[1634.26 --> 1635.52]  Like you can kind of
[1635.52 --> 1636.38]  You know
[1636.38 --> 1636.84]  You can kind of
[1636.84 --> 1637.58]  Look down and see
[1637.58 --> 1638.16]  Where you're going
[1638.16 --> 1639.06]  With the
[1639.06 --> 1639.74]  With the deck
[1639.74 --> 1640.28]  Not that you like
[1640.28 --> 1640.52]  Should
[1640.52 --> 1641.12]  You should just use
[1641.12 --> 1641.86]  The pass through cameras
[1641.86 --> 1642.28]  Obviously
[1642.28 --> 1643.44]  But you can
[1643.44 --> 1644.42]  Hot take
[1644.42 --> 1645.20]  Black and white
[1645.20 --> 1645.92]  Totally fine
[1645.92 --> 1647.22]  Oh I don't even care
[1647.22 --> 1647.68]  Who cares
[1647.68 --> 1648.22]  Dude I
[1648.22 --> 1648.92]  Oh man
[1648.92 --> 1650.48]  I had someone
[1650.48 --> 1651.26]  Like come at me
[1651.26 --> 1651.94]  In the comments
[1651.94 --> 1652.72]  Because I
[1652.72 --> 1654.08]  Because I criticized it
[1654.08 --> 1654.72]  For not being able
[1654.72 --> 1655.48]  To walk around
[1655.48 --> 1656.34]  With the camera
[1656.34 --> 1656.88]  Pass through
[1656.88 --> 1657.48]  And I was like
[1657.48 --> 1657.82]  Bro
[1657.82 --> 1659.70]  I'm joking
[1659.70 --> 1660.36]  Yeah
[1660.36 --> 1661.36]  I was taking a shot
[1661.36 --> 1662.92]  At Apple Vision Pro people
[1662.92 --> 1663.86]  Who were walking around
[1663.86 --> 1664.56]  With their stupid
[1664.56 --> 1665.24]  Headsets on
[1665.24 --> 1666.18]  For the first couple weeks
[1666.18 --> 1667.00]  Yeah
[1667.00 --> 1667.54]  I was like
[1667.54 --> 1667.94]  Oh yeah
[1667.94 --> 1669.00]  I don't even know
[1669.00 --> 1669.74]  If it was a couple weeks
[1669.74 --> 1670.22]  Yeah
[1670.22 --> 1671.10]  A week
[1671.10 --> 1672.46]  First few days
[1672.46 --> 1673.74]  And that stopped
[1673.74 --> 1674.38]  Pretty quick
[1674.38 --> 1674.72]  Yeah
[1674.72 --> 1677.30]  Yeah I don't really care
[1677.30 --> 1678.30]  About the black and white cameras
[1678.30 --> 1679.28]  This to me
[1679.28 --> 1680.72]  Feels like I have
[1680.72 --> 1683.00]  A seated or near
[1683.00 --> 1684.34]  Computer experience
[1684.34 --> 1685.22]  Which is like
[1685.22 --> 1686.58]  Really
[1686.58 --> 1689.02]  Dialed
[1689.02 --> 1689.88]  But
[1689.88 --> 1692.32]  Might kind of take
[1692.32 --> 1693.42]  Some setup time
[1693.42 --> 1695.82]  Move things out of the way
[1695.82 --> 1696.62]  Do stuff like that
[1696.62 --> 1697.08]  And then like
[1697.08 --> 1697.82]  Really settle into
[1697.82 --> 1698.66]  Like this nice
[1698.66 --> 1699.60]  Dialed
[1699.60 --> 1700.54]  Tethered experience
[1700.54 --> 1702.00]  And then the frame
[1702.00 --> 1703.36]  The frame's
[1703.36 --> 1704.68]  Interesting for a bunch
[1704.68 --> 1705.40]  Of reasons to me
[1705.40 --> 1706.26]  I almost want like
[1706.26 --> 1707.52]  A travel box for it
[1707.52 --> 1710.00]  I would use the crap
[1710.00 --> 1710.54]  Out of the frame
[1710.54 --> 1711.02]  On the road
[1711.02 --> 1711.38]  Yeah
[1711.38 --> 1712.30]  Being able to like
[1712.30 --> 1713.86]  Play some Beat Saber
[1713.86 --> 1714.72]  Oh yeah
[1714.72 --> 1715.62]  And like
[1715.62 --> 1716.14]  Just anywhere
[1716.14 --> 1716.84]  Because
[1716.84 --> 1717.76]  I actually
[1717.76 --> 1718.28]  On the plane
[1718.28 --> 1720.36]  I'm looking forward
[1720.36 --> 1721.04]  To trying this
[1721.04 --> 1722.78]  So much
[1722.78 --> 1724.78]  I have a Strix Halo laptop
[1724.78 --> 1725.30]  Yeah
[1725.30 --> 1725.90]  Oh yeah
[1725.90 --> 1727.80]  Is this enough
[1727.80 --> 1728.92]  For me to like
[1728.92 --> 1731.06]  Load up all my mods
[1731.06 --> 1731.44]  Probably
[1731.44 --> 1732.82]  Play VR games
[1732.82 --> 1733.34]  Probably
[1733.34 --> 1734.68]  I mean
[1734.68 --> 1736.02]  It's got a USB port
[1736.02 --> 1737.14]  So theoretically
[1737.14 --> 1737.76]  I've got my
[1737.76 --> 1739.00]  6 gigahertz wireless
[1739.00 --> 1739.74]  Like I'm
[1739.74 --> 1740.48]  Dude
[1740.48 --> 1741.86]  The frame packs
[1741.86 --> 1742.50]  I didn't actually
[1742.50 --> 1743.34]  Talk about that
[1743.34 --> 1743.94]  In the
[1743.94 --> 1744.86]  I should start
[1744.86 --> 1745.74]  Adding some stuff
[1745.74 --> 1746.26]  For my notes
[1746.26 --> 1746.74]  For the
[1746.74 --> 1747.66]  Stuff to talk about
[1747.66 --> 1748.44]  For the full review
[1748.44 --> 1749.78]  But I didn't actually
[1749.78 --> 1750.82]  Really talk about
[1750.82 --> 1752.20]  How tightly
[1752.20 --> 1753.12]  It packs up
[1753.12 --> 1756.22]  Yeah
[1756.22 --> 1756.92]  That's something
[1756.92 --> 1757.62]  I was genuinely
[1757.62 --> 1758.40]  Wondering about
[1758.40 --> 1760.04]  Because the
[1760.04 --> 1760.76]  The ability to be
[1760.76 --> 1761.30]  Portable with
[1761.30 --> 1761.64]  This thing
[1761.64 --> 1762.34]  Is actually
[1762.34 --> 1763.04]  Very interesting
[1763.04 --> 1763.36]  To me
[1763.36 --> 1765.32]  This
[1765.32 --> 1765.94]  I'm excited
[1765.94 --> 1766.48]  About this
[1766.48 --> 1767.94]  In regards to
[1767.94 --> 1769.22]  I don't know
[1769.22 --> 1769.66]  People are going
[1769.66 --> 1769.96]  To be like
[1769.96 --> 1770.58]  Oh you've
[1770.58 --> 1771.08]  You've been able
[1771.08 --> 1771.38]  To do this
[1771.38 --> 1771.76]  The whole time
[1771.76 --> 1772.48]  With the Quest 3
[1772.48 --> 1773.48]  I didn't love
[1773.48 --> 1774.62]  The Quest 3 experience
[1774.62 --> 1775.50]  Don't love
[1775.50 --> 1776.32]  Who the Quest 3
[1776.32 --> 1776.92]  Comes from
[1776.92 --> 1777.86]  I think that's
[1777.86 --> 1778.56]  The second one
[1778.56 --> 1779.18]  Is the bigger one
[1779.18 --> 1779.58]  For me
[1779.58 --> 1780.28]  Because apparently
[1780.28 --> 1780.92]  The software's
[1780.92 --> 1781.86]  Gotten a lot better
[1781.86 --> 1782.76]  Since we reviewed it
[1782.76 --> 1783.48]  I'm sure it has
[1783.48 --> 1784.22]  They've like
[1784.22 --> 1785.08]  Apparently
[1785.08 --> 1786.12]  I'm just going
[1786.12 --> 1786.64]  Based on
[1786.64 --> 1787.58]  Comments on
[1787.58 --> 1788.58]  The frame video
[1788.58 --> 1789.48]  But apparently
[1789.48 --> 1790.10]  It's like
[1790.10 --> 1791.88]  Improved a shocking
[1791.88 --> 1792.36]  Amount
[1792.36 --> 1793.86]  For software
[1793.86 --> 1794.36]  Updates
[1794.36 --> 1795.56]  So it might be
[1795.56 --> 1796.06]  Worth me
[1796.06 --> 1796.64]  Kind of checking
[1796.64 --> 1797.30]  It out again
[1797.30 --> 1798.82]  As part of this
[1798.82 --> 1799.32]  Actually I'm going
[1799.32 --> 1800.44]  To add that
[1800.44 --> 1804.30]  Cool
[1804.30 --> 1805.76]  Now that's on there
[1805.76 --> 1807.32]  Cool
[1807.32 --> 1808.04]  Yeah
[1808.04 --> 1809.62]  So I don't know
[1809.62 --> 1810.44]  I think my
[1810.44 --> 1810.82]  Like
[1810.82 --> 1812.26]  I feel like
[1812.26 --> 1812.84]  This is it
[1812.84 --> 1813.42]  I don't feel like
[1813.42 --> 1813.80]  There's another
[1813.80 --> 1815.08]  Experience that is
[1815.08 --> 1815.64]  Going to be this
[1815.64 --> 1816.20]  Good
[1816.20 --> 1817.90]  Might not feel
[1817.90 --> 1819.26]  As strong
[1819.26 --> 1819.68]  As it did
[1819.68 --> 1820.32]  In the past
[1820.32 --> 1821.00]  But I
[1821.00 --> 1822.14]  I think they're
[1822.14 --> 1822.46]  Going to be
[1822.46 --> 1822.84]  Different
[1822.84 --> 1824.42]  I think they're
[1824.42 --> 1824.68]  Going to be
[1824.68 --> 1825.30]  Quite different
[1825.30 --> 1825.78]  And I
[1825.78 --> 1826.50]  Don't necessarily
[1826.50 --> 1826.88]  Think I'm
[1826.88 --> 1827.26]  Actually going to
[1827.26 --> 1827.64]  Have that much
[1827.64 --> 1827.96]  Regret
[1827.96 --> 1829.42]  Right now
[1829.42 --> 1829.94]  Having
[1829.94 --> 1830.88]  Never actually
[1830.88 --> 1831.42]  Tried the one
[1831.42 --> 1831.92]  That I bought
[1831.92 --> 1832.68]  And clearly
[1832.68 --> 1833.34]  Never tried
[1833.34 --> 1833.90]  The one that's
[1833.90 --> 1834.14]  Coming
[1834.14 --> 1835.48]  But that's my
[1835.48 --> 1836.26]  Hunch right now
[1836.26 --> 1838.98]  Yeah
[1838.98 --> 1839.38]  You want to
[1839.38 --> 1840.00]  Talk steam machine
[1840.00 --> 1840.68]  Are you done
[1840.68 --> 1841.12]  With frame
[1841.12 --> 1842.84]  I think we can
[1842.84 --> 1843.70]  Talk steam machine
[1843.70 --> 1844.12]  Yeah
[1844.12 --> 1844.68]  I
[1844.68 --> 1845.84]  I just
[1845.84 --> 1846.64]  I'm
[1846.64 --> 1848.04]  The wireless
[1848.04 --> 1848.72]  Streaming dude
[1848.72 --> 1850.42]  It blew me away
[1850.42 --> 1851.04]  I get to have
[1851.04 --> 1851.88]  PC VR
[1851.88 --> 1852.96]  Wirelessly
[1852.96 --> 1854.90]  Wow
[1854.90 --> 1856.14]  Oh no
[1856.14 --> 1856.70]  There was the
[1856.70 --> 1857.20]  Last thing
[1857.20 --> 1857.80]  What's going to
[1857.80 --> 1858.84]  Happen to the
[1858.84 --> 1859.56]  The ecosystem
[1859.56 --> 1860.24]  Right
[1860.24 --> 1861.00]  Like could big
[1861.00 --> 1862.16]  Screen carry on
[1862.16 --> 1863.12]  Manufacturing base
[1863.12 --> 1864.00]  Stations for instance
[1864.00 --> 1866.30]  At this time
[1866.30 --> 1867.12]  Valve does not
[1867.12 --> 1867.68]  Appear to have
[1867.68 --> 1868.46]  Any partnerships
[1868.46 --> 1869.14]  In place
[1869.14 --> 1870.16]  For anyone to
[1870.16 --> 1870.72]  Continue to
[1870.72 --> 1870.88]  Produce
[1870.88 --> 1872.30]  Base stations
[1872.30 --> 1872.70]  Or knuckles
[1872.70 --> 1873.24]  Controllers
[1873.24 --> 1873.76]  They did say
[1873.76 --> 1874.30]  They were open
[1874.30 --> 1874.70]  To it
[1874.70 --> 1876.02]  With that
[1876.02 --> 1876.52]  Said
[1876.52 --> 1878.24]  I have
[1878.24 --> 1878.74]  Direct
[1878.74 --> 1879.36]  Contact
[1879.36 --> 1880.00]  Information
[1880.00 --> 1880.90]  For multiple
[1880.90 --> 1881.46]  People at
[1881.46 --> 1881.76]  Valve
[1881.76 --> 1883.16]  They are
[1883.16 --> 1885.02]  Not always
[1885.02 --> 1885.56]  The easiest
[1885.56 --> 1886.24]  To work with
[1886.24 --> 1887.20]  So
[1887.20 --> 1888.30]  Just because
[1888.30 --> 1888.82]  They're open
[1888.82 --> 1889.18]  To it
[1889.18 --> 1889.58]  Does not
[1889.58 --> 1890.48]  Necessarily mean
[1890.48 --> 1890.92]  That anything
[1890.92 --> 1891.48]  Will happen
[1891.48 --> 1892.84]  I'm not
[1892.84 --> 1893.20]  Going to have
[1893.20 --> 1893.86]  My hopes up
[1893.86 --> 1894.76]  Until I see
[1894.76 --> 1895.84]  Concrete
[1895.84 --> 1896.94]  Action on it
[1896.94 --> 1898.18]  And that
[1898.18 --> 1899.06]  It's not
[1899.06 --> 1899.94]  It's not a shot
[1899.94 --> 1900.78]  It's not a shot
[1900.78 --> 1901.06]  At them
[1901.06 --> 1901.64]  It's just that
[1901.64 --> 1901.98]  You got to
[1901.98 --> 1902.34]  Understand
[1902.34 --> 1902.96]  Valve's a very
[1902.96 --> 1903.66]  Small company
[1903.66 --> 1907.16]  Which
[1907.16 --> 1907.84]  Headcount wise
[1907.84 --> 1908.54]  Is actually
[1908.54 --> 1909.38]  Somewhat true
[1909.38 --> 1910.62]  Yes
[1910.62 --> 1911.56]  Which I only
[1911.56 --> 1912.58]  Mention because
[1912.58 --> 1913.70]  You know
[1913.70 --> 1914.92]  That excuse
[1914.92 --> 1915.46]  Was made
[1915.46 --> 1916.34]  For some stuff
[1916.34 --> 1917.64]  I was like
[1917.64 --> 1918.00]  Okay
[1918.00 --> 1918.70]  Sure
[1918.70 --> 1920.82]  Sure
[1920.82 --> 1920.86]  Sure
[1920.86 --> 1922.72]  To be clear
[1922.72 --> 1923.66]  I'm very
[1923.66 --> 1924.38]  Grateful that
[1924.38 --> 1924.82]  They were able
[1924.82 --> 1925.36]  To bring us
[1925.36 --> 1925.94]  Out to
[1925.94 --> 1926.46]  To check
[1926.46 --> 1926.76]  Out the
[1926.76 --> 1927.36]  New hardware
[1927.36 --> 1929.42]  I'm very
[1929.42 --> 1930.12]  Excited
[1930.12 --> 1930.74]  About the
[1930.74 --> 1931.24]  New hardware
[1931.24 --> 1933.68]  And I am
[1933.68 --> 1935.22]  Extremely excited
[1935.22 --> 1936.14]  To learn more
[1936.14 --> 1937.04]  As I get to
[1937.04 --> 1938.02]  Kind of explore it
[1938.02 --> 1939.04]  I'm hoping
[1939.04 --> 1940.28]  That we're going
[1940.28 --> 1941.32]  To have access
[1941.32 --> 1942.16]  Prior to the
[1942.16 --> 1942.84]  Actual launch
[1942.84 --> 1943.12]  Date
[1943.12 --> 1944.02]  So that when
[1944.02 --> 1944.48]  Launch day
[1944.48 --> 1945.24]  Comes we can
[1945.24 --> 1946.02]  Bring you guys
[1946.02 --> 1946.66]  Like really
[1946.66 --> 1947.30]  Detailed
[1947.30 --> 1948.08]  Okay but no
[1948.08 --> 1949.32]  Answering all
[1949.32 --> 1950.12]  The questions
[1950.12 --> 1952.52]  Like thick
[1952.52 --> 1953.58]  Reviews of all
[1953.58 --> 1954.14]  Of this stuff
[1954.14 --> 1955.52]  Because it's
[1955.52 --> 1956.50]  Basically game
[1956.50 --> 1957.14]  Changing across
[1957.14 --> 1957.54]  The board
[1957.54 --> 1957.94]  Which I guess
[1957.94 --> 1958.76]  Brings us perfectly
[1958.76 --> 1959.34]  To the steam
[1959.34 --> 1959.64]  Machine
[1959.64 --> 1960.88]  It's a new
[1960.88 --> 1961.44]  Mini pc
[1961.44 --> 1962.38]  That's boasting
[1962.38 --> 1963.30]  Roughly six
[1963.30 --> 1963.78]  Times the
[1963.78 --> 1964.46]  Performance of the
[1964.46 --> 1964.88]  Steam deck
[1964.88 --> 1965.50]  Powered by an
[1965.50 --> 1966.42]  AMD six core
[1966.42 --> 1968.02]  Zen four cpu
[1968.02 --> 1969.26]  A gpu
[1969.26 --> 1969.94]  That is a
[1969.94 --> 1971.28]  Semi custom
[1971.28 --> 1972.16]  Design but
[1972.16 --> 1973.30]  As far as I
[1973.30 --> 1973.78]  Can tell
[1973.78 --> 1974.98]  This pretty
[1974.98 --> 1975.62]  Much comes
[1975.62 --> 1976.28]  Down more
[1976.28 --> 1977.00]  To power
[1977.00 --> 1977.84]  Profile tuning
[1977.84 --> 1978.48]  And firmware
[1978.48 --> 1980.38]  And drivers
[1980.38 --> 1981.14]  Right like
[1981.14 --> 1981.74]  The actual
[1981.74 --> 1982.58]  The actual
[1982.58 --> 1983.12]  Silicon
[1983.12 --> 1984.82]  Appears to
[1984.82 --> 1986.72]  Be more
[1986.72 --> 1987.82]  Customized in
[1987.82 --> 1988.42]  The sense that
[1988.42 --> 1989.26]  AMD is going
[1989.26 --> 1989.86]  Okay so you
[1989.86 --> 1990.36]  Want to fuse
[1990.36 --> 1991.26]  Off this and
[1991.26 --> 1993.04]  Not that and
[1993.04 --> 1994.80]  And tune your
[1994.80 --> 1995.72]  Power profile like
[1995.72 --> 1996.42]  It's not it's
[1996.42 --> 1997.02]  Not brand new
[1997.02 --> 1998.78]  Silicon 16 gigs
[1998.78 --> 1999.44]  Of so dim
[1999.44 --> 2000.50]  DDR5 memory
[2000.50 --> 2001.70]  8 gigs of
[2001.70 --> 2003.26]  GDDR6 VRAM
[2003.26 --> 2004.24]  And either
[2004.24 --> 2005.48]  512 gig or
[2005.48 --> 2006.66]  2 terabyte
[2006.66 --> 2007.72]  SSDs but
[2007.72 --> 2008.54]  The SSD is
[2008.54 --> 2009.78]  Upgradable to
[2009.78 --> 2010.94]  A 2280 so
[2010.94 --> 2011.48]  You could throw
[2011.48 --> 2012.00]  Up to an
[2012.00 --> 2012.64]  8 terabyte
[2012.64 --> 2013.26]  Drive with
[2013.26 --> 2013.60]  Current
[2013.60 --> 2014.48]  NAND
[2014.48 --> 2015.22]  Densities
[2015.22 --> 2017.78]  The big deal
[2017.78 --> 2018.38]  Is of course
[2018.38 --> 2019.08]  That it runs
[2019.08 --> 2020.04]  Steam OS
[2020.04 --> 2020.60]  Yeah
[2020.60 --> 2021.68]  Linux out of
[2021.68 --> 2022.08]  The box
[2022.08 --> 2023.52]  And comes
[2023.52 --> 2023.96]  With the new
[2023.96 --> 2024.88]  Steam controller
[2024.88 --> 2025.72]  It uses
[2025.72 --> 2026.44]  TMR analog
[2026.44 --> 2026.90]  Sticks
[2026.90 --> 2027.62]  Has an
[2027.62 --> 2028.58]  Xbox style
[2028.58 --> 2029.38]  Layout with
[2029.38 --> 2030.18]  A playstation
[2030.18 --> 2030.96]  Analog stick
[2030.96 --> 2032.32]  Layout to make
[2032.32 --> 2032.72]  Room for
[2032.72 --> 2033.10]  The two
[2033.10 --> 2033.72]  Haptic track
[2033.72 --> 2034.28]  Pads on
[2034.28 --> 2034.68]  The bottom
[2034.68 --> 2035.38]  Similar to
[2035.38 --> 2035.74]  The steam
[2035.74 --> 2036.04]  Deck
[2036.04 --> 2036.68]  How did
[2036.68 --> 2037.18]  It feel
[2037.18 --> 2038.48]  To hold
[2038.48 --> 2040.06]  It looks a little
[2040.06 --> 2040.34]  Wild
[2040.34 --> 2041.38]  Smaller hands
[2041.38 --> 2042.54]  I would say
[2042.54 --> 2043.80]  Not the most
[2043.80 --> 2044.92]  Ergonomic controller
[2044.92 --> 2045.62]  I've ever held
[2045.62 --> 2046.70]  It did give me
[2046.70 --> 2047.74]  Obviously not the
[2047.74 --> 2048.44]  Same but it did
[2048.44 --> 2049.12]  Give me like
[2049.12 --> 2049.94]  Duke vibes
[2049.94 --> 2050.78]  A little bit
[2050.78 --> 2051.46]  Not quite
[2051.46 --> 2052.26]  Yeah okay
[2052.26 --> 2054.16]  She's not so
[2054.16 --> 2054.82]  Thick
[2054.82 --> 2056.26]  Like the duke
[2056.26 --> 2056.98]  But like
[2056.98 --> 2057.62]  Tall
[2057.62 --> 2058.48]  She's
[2058.48 --> 2059.18]  She's just
[2059.18 --> 2059.94]  She's just
[2059.94 --> 2060.32]  You know
[2060.32 --> 2061.28]  She's girthy
[2061.28 --> 2062.86]  But not thick
[2062.86 --> 2063.34]  You know
[2063.34 --> 2064.00]  Like she's
[2064.00 --> 2065.52]  Like she's
[2065.52 --> 2066.46]  She's wide
[2066.46 --> 2067.40]  You know
[2067.40 --> 2068.68]  Oh this way
[2068.68 --> 2069.12]  You know
[2069.12 --> 2069.72]  She's just
[2069.72 --> 2070.16]  Well no
[2070.16 --> 2070.84]  She's just
[2070.84 --> 2072.58]  She's ample
[2072.58 --> 2074.02]  Okay
[2074.02 --> 2075.58]  I'd say she's ample
[2075.58 --> 2076.60]  Was that not a
[2076.60 --> 2077.76]  Characteristic of the duke
[2077.76 --> 2079.16]  Yeah but
[2079.16 --> 2079.58]  You know
[2079.58 --> 2080.08]  Well the duke
[2080.08 --> 2080.66]  Was fat
[2080.66 --> 2081.72]  Okay
[2081.72 --> 2082.56]  The steam
[2082.56 --> 2083.14]  Controller's
[2083.14 --> 2083.68]  Ample
[2083.68 --> 2084.92]  Okay
[2084.92 --> 2085.40]  Yeah
[2085.40 --> 2086.10]  Sure
[2086.10 --> 2086.96]  Yeah
[2086.96 --> 2087.52]  Sure
[2087.52 --> 2088.16]  And I don't mean
[2088.16 --> 2089.08]  Like ph fat
[2089.08 --> 2089.66]  The duke was
[2089.66 --> 2090.00]  FAT
[2090.00 --> 2090.62]  I think I'm just
[2090.62 --> 2091.20]  Gonna wait
[2091.20 --> 2092.02]  The duke was fat
[2092.02 --> 2092.72]  Try it myself
[2092.72 --> 2093.84]  When I was looking at it
[2093.84 --> 2094.64]  I thought
[2094.64 --> 2095.38]  That's probably
[2095.38 --> 2096.14]  Gonna be fine for me
[2096.14 --> 2096.76]  To be honest
[2096.76 --> 2097.14]  I'm actually
[2097.14 --> 2098.02]  Pretty excited about it
[2098.02 --> 2098.58]  Yeah
[2098.58 --> 2100.18]  I thought the original
[2100.18 --> 2100.80]  Steam controller
[2100.80 --> 2101.62]  Was really cool
[2101.62 --> 2102.54]  This one seems
[2102.54 --> 2103.26]  More versatile
[2103.26 --> 2104.66]  Which is neat
[2104.66 --> 2105.54]  Although to be
[2105.54 --> 2106.22]  Completely honest
[2106.22 --> 2107.34]  If you can afford it
[2107.34 --> 2107.98]  I feel like
[2107.98 --> 2109.20]  The play
[2109.20 --> 2109.86]  Is gonna be
[2109.86 --> 2110.74]  To have a normal
[2110.74 --> 2111.28]  Controller
[2111.28 --> 2113.02]  And then just
[2113.02 --> 2113.86]  Maybe also
[2113.86 --> 2114.70]  Your steam controller
[2114.70 --> 2115.16]  Yeah
[2115.16 --> 2115.70]  Cause the
[2115.70 --> 2116.34]  The touchpads
[2116.34 --> 2116.88]  On steam controller
[2116.88 --> 2117.62]  Will be nice
[2117.62 --> 2118.04]  Sometimes
[2118.04 --> 2119.00]  Yeah and super cool
[2119.00 --> 2119.30]  Yeah
[2119.30 --> 2120.32]  And some people
[2120.32 --> 2121.48]  Are going to just
[2121.48 --> 2123.22]  Daily the crap
[2123.22 --> 2124.28]  Out of the touchpads
[2124.28 --> 2124.78]  Yeah
[2124.78 --> 2126.54]  Obviously there will be
[2126.54 --> 2127.06]  Certain games
[2127.06 --> 2127.40]  That will play
[2127.40 --> 2127.76]  A lot better
[2127.76 --> 2128.10]  That way
[2128.10 --> 2129.16]  Particularly for
[2129.16 --> 2129.68]  Old dogs
[2129.68 --> 2130.34]  That don't want
[2130.34 --> 2131.12]  To learn new tricks
[2131.12 --> 2131.96]  A more traditional
[2131.96 --> 2132.42]  Controller
[2132.42 --> 2133.00]  And man
[2133.00 --> 2134.56]  There's so many
[2134.56 --> 2135.58]  Great
[2135.58 --> 2135.64]  Great
[2135.64 --> 2136.92]  Super cool
[2136.92 --> 2137.98]  Innovative controllers
[2137.98 --> 2138.38]  Out there
[2138.38 --> 2138.44]  Yeah
[2138.44 --> 2138.70]  Like
[2138.70 --> 2140.18]  After doing that
[2140.18 --> 2141.16]  Controller tier list
[2141.16 --> 2142.02]  Video with David
[2142.02 --> 2142.60]  Where we did the
[2142.60 --> 2143.60]  Whole like playoff
[2143.60 --> 2144.86]  Man I
[2144.86 --> 2145.44]  I don't
[2145.44 --> 2147.24]  I don't think
[2147.24 --> 2147.96]  You can get away
[2147.96 --> 2148.52]  With having a
[2148.52 --> 2149.04]  Top of the line
[2149.04 --> 2149.88]  Controller anymore
[2149.88 --> 2150.78]  That doesn't have
[2150.78 --> 2151.56]  Adjustable tension
[2151.56 --> 2152.42]  On the analog sticks
[2152.42 --> 2153.32]  Like it's just
[2153.32 --> 2154.64]  It was so
[2154.64 --> 2155.82]  Game changing
[2155.82 --> 2156.44]  Yeah
[2156.44 --> 2157.86]  For me anyway
[2157.86 --> 2158.74]  That I was just like
[2158.74 --> 2159.70]  Well everything else
[2159.70 --> 2160.84]  Is basic now
[2160.84 --> 2162.22]  And that doesn't mean
[2162.22 --> 2163.04]  That I necessarily
[2163.04 --> 2163.48]  You know
[2163.48 --> 2164.12]  Want to go and
[2164.12 --> 2165.22]  Replace every controller
[2165.22 --> 2165.80]  In my house
[2165.80 --> 2166.64]  With those
[2166.64 --> 2167.42]  In some cases
[2167.42 --> 2169.16]  Quite expensive
[2169.16 --> 2170.68]  Aftermarket controllers
[2170.68 --> 2171.06]  But
[2171.06 --> 2172.84]  Little brother controllers
[2172.84 --> 2174.26]  Are the big brother
[2174.26 --> 2175.06]  Controller now
[2175.06 --> 2176.18]  It's not the way
[2176.18 --> 2176.88]  That it used to be
[2176.88 --> 2177.58]  Where first party
[2177.58 --> 2178.06]  Was king
[2178.06 --> 2179.66]  What is cool
[2179.66 --> 2180.14]  About the steam
[2180.14 --> 2180.74]  Controller though
[2180.74 --> 2181.82]  Is each of their
[2181.82 --> 2182.26]  Puck
[2182.26 --> 2184.72]  Wireless dongles
[2184.72 --> 2185.50]  Supports up to
[2185.50 --> 2186.20]  Four of them
[2186.20 --> 2187.94]  And steam will
[2187.94 --> 2188.74]  Support up to
[2188.74 --> 2189.48]  Four pucks
[2189.48 --> 2190.66]  Meaning sixteen
[2190.66 --> 2191.58]  Controllers to one
[2191.58 --> 2191.92]  Machine
[2191.92 --> 2192.64]  Making for
[2192.64 --> 2193.98]  Hassle free
[2193.98 --> 2194.62]  Ten player
[2194.62 --> 2195.16]  Tape to tape
[2195.16 --> 2195.70]  Which is all that
[2195.70 --> 2196.40]  I really care about
[2196.40 --> 2197.26]  As far as that goes
[2197.26 --> 2199.50]  There's a lot more
[2199.50 --> 2200.24]  To break down
[2200.24 --> 2201.48]  Once we actually
[2201.48 --> 2202.24]  You know
[2202.24 --> 2204.12]  Finish reviewing
[2204.12 --> 2204.70]  These devices
[2204.70 --> 2205.26]  And there's actually
[2205.26 --> 2205.96]  More details
[2205.96 --> 2206.98]  In the two main
[2206.98 --> 2208.04]  Channel ltt videos
[2208.04 --> 2208.58]  That we have up
[2208.58 --> 2209.12]  On these devices
[2209.12 --> 2209.76]  You guys can go
[2209.76 --> 2210.36]  Check those out
[2210.36 --> 2211.62]  But in the meantime
[2211.62 --> 2212.96]  I want to talk
[2212.96 --> 2213.62]  About pricing
[2213.62 --> 2214.36]  For the steam
[2214.36 --> 2214.72]  Machine
[2214.72 --> 2216.96]  Actually no
[2216.96 --> 2217.80]  What I want you
[2217.80 --> 2218.34]  Guys to do
[2218.34 --> 2218.68]  Chat
[2218.68 --> 2219.36]  Get out of here
[2219.36 --> 2221.68]  Is let me know
[2221.68 --> 2222.16]  What you would
[2222.16 --> 2222.76]  Pay for it
[2222.76 --> 2224.12]  So basically
[2224.12 --> 2224.66]  It's a
[2224.66 --> 2224.96]  It's a
[2224.96 --> 2226.14]  7600 cpu
[2226.14 --> 2227.34]  And a
[2227.34 --> 2228.52]  7600 gpu
[2228.52 --> 2229.42]  This is not
[2229.42 --> 2230.38]  A super powerful
[2230.38 --> 2230.90]  Machine
[2230.90 --> 2232.62]  Valve is
[2232.62 --> 2233.70]  Up front
[2233.70 --> 2234.38]  Saying that
[2234.38 --> 2234.80]  They are going
[2234.80 --> 2235.58]  To be relying
[2235.58 --> 2237.28]  On fsr
[2237.28 --> 2237.88]  In order to
[2237.88 --> 2239.10]  Achieve 4k
[2239.10 --> 2240.64]  And even
[2240.64 --> 2241.20]  Then man
[2241.20 --> 2242.02]  Like 8 gigs
[2242.02 --> 2242.60]  VRAM
[2242.60 --> 2244.22]  Anyone else
[2244.22 --> 2245.16]  Would be taking
[2245.16 --> 2246.86]  A ton of flack
[2246.86 --> 2248.32]  For shipping a game
[2248.32 --> 2249.12]  Console today
[2249.12 --> 2249.78]  With 8 gigs
[2249.78 --> 2250.28]  Of VRAM
[2250.28 --> 2250.68]  Yeah
[2250.68 --> 2253.40]  So we've got a lot
[2253.40 --> 2254.06]  Of people talking
[2254.06 --> 2254.76]  Pricing in here
[2254.76 --> 2255.04]  I'm gonna
[2255.04 --> 2255.62]  I'm gonna read
[2255.62 --> 2256.00]  These
[2256.00 --> 2257.06]  600
[2257.06 --> 2257.48]  600
[2257.48 --> 2257.90]  600
[2257.90 --> 2258.28]  600
[2258.28 --> 2258.78]  600
[2258.78 --> 2259.32]  350
[2259.32 --> 2260.16]  800
[2260.16 --> 2261.26]  Maybe 600
[2261.26 --> 2262.26]  1000
[2262.26 --> 2263.12]  You're crazy
[2263.12 --> 2264.46]  500
[2264.46 --> 2265.42]  Topps
[2265.42 --> 2266.30]  Or DOA
[2266.30 --> 2267.12]  250
[2267.12 --> 2268.18]  PS5
[2268.18 --> 2268.70]  So like
[2268.70 --> 2270.28]  500 to 600
[2270.28 --> 2271.58]  599
[2271.58 --> 2272.22]  699
[2272.22 --> 2272.96]  500
[2272.96 --> 2274.10]  Okay
[2274.10 --> 2277.46]  A lot of
[2277.46 --> 2278.48]  500 to 600
[2278.48 --> 2279.66]  I don't think so
[2279.66 --> 2280.64]  I
[2280.64 --> 2281.76]  Can't tell you
[2281.76 --> 2282.70]  What the price will be
[2282.70 --> 2283.68]  Because I literally
[2283.68 --> 2284.30]  Don't know
[2284.30 --> 2286.32]  But when I said
[2286.32 --> 2287.82]  You know
[2287.82 --> 2289.60]  I'm disappointed
[2289.60 --> 2290.98]  That it isn't going to
[2290.98 --> 2292.00]  Follow a console
[2292.00 --> 2293.26]  Pricing model
[2293.26 --> 2294.72]  Where it's
[2294.72 --> 2295.56]  Subsidized
[2295.56 --> 2296.46]  By the fact that
[2296.46 --> 2297.04]  You know
[2297.04 --> 2297.72]  The manufacturer
[2297.72 --> 2298.54]  Is gonna be taking
[2298.54 --> 2299.92]  30% of every game
[2299.92 --> 2300.54]  Sold on it
[2300.54 --> 2301.08]  Over the
[2301.08 --> 2302.52]  Lifespan of this thing
[2302.52 --> 2304.26]  Because I feel
[2304.26 --> 2305.24]  That would be a more
[2305.24 --> 2306.50]  Meaningful
[2306.50 --> 2307.02]  Product
[2307.02 --> 2309.38]  And they kind of
[2309.38 --> 2310.10]  Asked what I meant
[2310.10 --> 2310.60]  By well
[2310.60 --> 2311.86]  What do you mean by
[2311.86 --> 2313.10]  Console price
[2313.10 --> 2314.08]  And I said
[2314.08 --> 2314.32]  Well
[2314.32 --> 2315.06]  500
[2315.06 --> 2317.86]  Nobody said
[2317.86 --> 2318.34]  Anything
[2318.34 --> 2320.48]  But the energy
[2320.48 --> 2321.10]  Of the room
[2321.10 --> 2322.72]  Wasn't great
[2322.72 --> 2324.70]  So
[2324.70 --> 2325.68]  Oh a console
[2325.68 --> 2326.66]  Isn't 500 bucks
[2326.66 --> 2327.42]  Maybe that's why
[2327.42 --> 2331.06]  I mean
[2331.06 --> 2332.38]  PS5 Pro is
[2332.38 --> 2332.74]  700
[2332.74 --> 2334.06]  Yeah the PS5 Pro
[2334.06 --> 2334.60]  But we're talking
[2334.60 --> 2334.96]  The Pro
[2334.96 --> 2335.46]  I mean the Pro
[2335.46 --> 2336.44]  Is markedly
[2336.44 --> 2336.96]  More powerful
[2336.96 --> 2337.48]  Than the Steam
[2337.48 --> 2337.78]  Machine
[2337.78 --> 2339.30]  True
[2339.30 --> 2340.44]  So
[2340.44 --> 2342.10]  PS5 Pro
[2342.10 --> 2342.68]  Radeon
[2342.68 --> 2343.18]  Equivalent
[2343.18 --> 2343.66]  I think it's
[2343.66 --> 2344.52]  More equivalent
[2344.52 --> 2345.02]  To like
[2345.02 --> 2346.42]  A 7700
[2346.42 --> 2347.02]  I'll follow
[2347.02 --> 2347.66]  Consoles enough
[2347.66 --> 2348.62]  Let me have a look
[2348.62 --> 2349.64]  Let me have a look
[2349.64 --> 2350.44]  So that is
[2350.44 --> 2351.34]  More equivalent
[2351.34 --> 2352.28]  To a
[2352.28 --> 2353.78]  7700 XT
[2353.78 --> 2355.60]  And then
[2355.60 --> 2356.18]  The base
[2356.18 --> 2356.84]  PS5
[2356.84 --> 2357.80]  Is about
[2357.80 --> 2358.40]  An RX
[2358.40 --> 2359.28]  6700
[2359.28 --> 2360.32]  So
[2360.32 --> 2361.18]  The base
[2361.18 --> 2361.68]  PS5
[2361.68 --> 2362.34]  Is closer
[2362.34 --> 2363.10]  To the Steam
[2363.10 --> 2363.34]  Machine
[2363.34 --> 2363.88]  In terms of
[2363.88 --> 2364.36]  Performance
[2364.36 --> 2365.82]  With that said
[2365.82 --> 2366.18]  You know
[2366.18 --> 2366.82]  It's not like
[2366.82 --> 2367.16]  The Steam
[2367.16 --> 2367.54]  Machine
[2367.54 --> 2368.32]  Even if it's
[2368.32 --> 2369.08]  At 600
[2369.08 --> 2369.66]  Or 700
[2369.66 --> 2370.66]  Isn't going to
[2370.66 --> 2371.00]  Have any
[2371.00 --> 2371.72]  Justification
[2371.72 --> 2372.18]  For it
[2372.18 --> 2372.82]  The disk
[2372.82 --> 2373.18]  Drive
[2373.18 --> 2374.12]  PS5
[2374.12 --> 2374.68]  Non-Pro
[2374.68 --> 2375.54]  Is 550
[2375.54 --> 2376.10]  Does the
[2376.10 --> 2376.32]  Steam
[2376.32 --> 2376.56]  Machine
[2376.56 --> 2376.92]  Have a
[2376.92 --> 2377.20]  Disk
[2377.20 --> 2377.70]  Drive
[2377.70 --> 2378.30]  No
[2378.30 --> 2379.20]  Okay then
[2379.20 --> 2380.98]  Well I don't
[2380.98 --> 2381.32]  Think so
[2381.32 --> 2382.46]  It has a lot
[2382.46 --> 2383.02]  Of other stuff
[2383.02 --> 2383.60]  Going on though
[2383.60 --> 2384.74]  Yeah I mean
[2384.74 --> 2385.88]  Compared to a
[2385.88 --> 2386.18]  PlayStation
[2386.18 --> 2387.64]  Yeah you can
[2387.64 --> 2388.18]  Use it as a
[2388.18 --> 2388.52]  Computer
[2388.52 --> 2389.56]  But I think
[2389.56 --> 2389.94]  A lot of
[2389.94 --> 2390.62]  People won't
[2390.62 --> 2391.94]  And the fact
[2391.94 --> 2392.48]  That Valve
[2392.48 --> 2392.84]  Is shipping
[2392.84 --> 2393.22]  This thing
[2393.22 --> 2393.56]  With a
[2393.56 --> 2393.98]  Controller
[2393.98 --> 2395.40]  Tells me
[2395.40 --> 2395.96]  That this is
[2395.96 --> 2397.12]  A controller
[2397.12 --> 2397.74]  With touchpads
[2397.74 --> 2398.00]  On it
[2398.00 --> 2398.70]  And all but
[2398.70 --> 2399.46]  One demo
[2399.46 --> 2400.54]  All but
[2400.54 --> 2401.22]  One demo
[2401.22 --> 2401.82]  That they had
[2401.82 --> 2402.10]  In their
[2402.10 --> 2402.64]  Big like
[2402.64 --> 2403.24]  Demo room
[2403.24 --> 2404.24]  Was it
[2404.24 --> 2404.56]  Hooked up
[2404.56 --> 2404.98]  To a TV
[2404.98 --> 2406.06]  Like it
[2406.06 --> 2406.46]  Wasn't
[2406.46 --> 2406.98]  They had
[2406.98 --> 2407.46]  The one
[2407.46 --> 2407.82]  Where it was
[2407.82 --> 2408.16]  Hooked up
[2408.16 --> 2408.58]  To a monitor
[2408.58 --> 2409.14]  TVs
[2409.14 --> 2409.90]  For sure
[2409.90 --> 2410.44]  Right
[2410.44 --> 2411.68]  I still just
[2411.68 --> 2412.04]  Think it's
[2412.04 --> 2412.40]  It's not
[2412.40 --> 2412.76]  It's not
[2412.76 --> 2413.16]  Completely
[2413.16 --> 2413.76]  Equivalent
[2413.76 --> 2416.48]  I mean
[2416.48 --> 2417.66]  Yeah
[2417.66 --> 2418.44]  I'm not surprised
[2418.44 --> 2418.82]  It would be
[2418.82 --> 2419.32]  More expensive
[2419.32 --> 2420.10]  I think it
[2420.10 --> 2420.74]  Honestly makes
[2420.74 --> 2421.16]  Sense that it
[2421.16 --> 2421.40]  Would probably
[2421.40 --> 2422.00]  Be more expensive
[2422.00 --> 2423.48]  There's not
[2423.48 --> 2425.80]  Which one
[2425.80 --> 2426.04]  Would be
[2426.04 --> 2426.58]  More expensive
[2426.58 --> 2427.50]  The
[2427.50 --> 2427.90]  Steam
[2427.90 --> 2428.10]  Machine
[2428.10 --> 2429.22]  What is it
[2429.22 --> 2429.50]  Adding
[2429.50 --> 2431.92]  It's a
[2431.92 --> 2432.30]  Computer
[2432.30 --> 2433.14]  Sure
[2433.14 --> 2434.64]  How much
[2434.64 --> 2435.04]  Are you going
[2435.04 --> 2435.80]  To compute
[2435.80 --> 2436.66]  From
[2436.66 --> 2437.70]  Your couch
[2437.70 --> 2440.04]  I can
[2440.04 --> 2440.54]  Definitely
[2440.54 --> 2441.04]  See people
[2441.04 --> 2441.58]  Using it
[2441.58 --> 2442.10]  In that
[2442.10 --> 2442.36]  Way
[2442.36 --> 2442.60]  And I
[2442.60 --> 2442.82]  Can see
[2442.82 --> 2443.08]  That being
[2443.08 --> 2443.46]  A value
[2443.46 --> 2443.86]  Add for
[2443.86 --> 2444.16]  People
[2444.16 --> 2444.46]  And it
[2444.46 --> 2444.82]  Being more
[2444.82 --> 2445.14]  Expensive
[2445.14 --> 2445.58]  Because of
[2445.58 --> 2445.78]  That
[2445.78 --> 2447.04]  Sure
[2447.04 --> 2447.48]  I'm just
[2447.48 --> 2447.80]  Saying I
[2447.80 --> 2448.38]  Understand why
[2448.38 --> 2448.76]  The pricing
[2448.76 --> 2449.16]  Might work
[2449.16 --> 2449.56]  That way
[2449.56 --> 2450.10]  I'm not
[2450.10 --> 2450.52]  Saying it's
[2450.52 --> 2450.84]  Good
[2450.84 --> 2451.14]  When you
[2451.14 --> 2451.46]  Were saying
[2451.46 --> 2451.94]  There's more
[2451.94 --> 2452.28]  To it
[2452.28 --> 2452.48]  I thought
[2452.48 --> 2452.70]  You meant
[2452.70 --> 2453.12]  There's like
[2453.12 --> 2453.72]  More hardware
[2453.72 --> 2454.18]  That I'm not
[2454.18 --> 2454.84]  Accounting for
[2454.84 --> 2455.18]  That would
[2455.18 --> 2455.58]  Make it
[2455.58 --> 2456.24]  Like the cost
[2456.24 --> 2456.52]  Higher
[2456.52 --> 2456.92]  It's a
[2456.92 --> 2458.24]  Different device
[2458.24 --> 2458.90]  Sure
[2458.90 --> 2459.22]  Yeah
[2459.22 --> 2459.52]  Yeah
[2459.52 --> 2459.80]  It's a
[2459.80 --> 2460.30]  Different device
[2460.30 --> 2460.80]  But you
[2460.80 --> 2461.36]  Know for me
[2461.36 --> 2461.74]  Look the
[2461.74 --> 2462.36]  Question is
[2462.36 --> 2462.92]  Like from a
[2462.92 --> 2463.58]  Performance
[2463.58 --> 2464.30]  Standpoint
[2467.70 --> 2468.14]  Gonna hook up
[2468.14 --> 2468.42]  To my
[2468.42 --> 2468.80]  TV
[2468.80 --> 2469.30]  I'm not
[2469.30 --> 2469.80]  Computing
[2469.80 --> 2470.58]  I'm gaming
[2470.58 --> 2471.08]  I'm gaming
[2471.08 --> 2471.44]  From my
[2471.44 --> 2471.74]  Couch
[2471.74 --> 2472.72]  So the
[2472.72 --> 2473.36]  Biggest justification
[2473.36 --> 2474.06]  To me is that
[2474.06 --> 2474.44]  I can take
[2474.44 --> 2474.88]  Advantage of
[2474.88 --> 2475.36]  Steam sales
[2475.36 --> 2475.68]  I don't have
[2475.68 --> 2475.90]  To buy
[2475.90 --> 2476.30]  Things in
[2476.30 --> 2476.40]  The
[2476.40 --> 2476.66]  PlayStation
[2476.66 --> 2477.18]  Store
[2477.18 --> 2478.54]  That's
[2478.54 --> 2479.52]  If it's
[2479.52 --> 2479.78]  Going to be
[2479.78 --> 2480.44]  More expensive
[2480.44 --> 2480.98]  That's the
[2480.98 --> 2481.68]  More meaningful
[2481.68 --> 2482.10]  There are
[2482.10 --> 2482.70]  Benefits to
[2482.70 --> 2483.40]  It being a
[2483.40 --> 2484.28]  Compute device
[2484.28 --> 2484.90]  On your
[2484.90 --> 2485.18]  TV
[2485.18 --> 2485.88]  For sure
[2485.88 --> 2486.26]  Sure
[2486.26 --> 2486.60]  I think
[2486.60 --> 2487.02]  Saying no
[2487.02 --> 2487.24]  To that
[2487.24 --> 2487.70]  Is crazy
[2487.70 --> 2487.94]  I mean
[2487.94 --> 2488.54]  Hit me
[2488.54 --> 2489.60]  Like what
[2489.60 --> 2489.78]  You can
[2489.78 --> 2490.48]  Pirate things
[2490.48 --> 2491.16]  Okay but
[2491.16 --> 2491.54]  I can't
[2491.54 --> 2492.22]  Watch like
[2492.22 --> 2493.10]  Proper HDR
[2493.10 --> 2493.46]  Netflix
[2493.46 --> 2494.28]  Because it's
[2494.28 --> 2494.52]  Linux
[2494.52 --> 2496.84]  I mean
[2496.84 --> 2497.76]  You could
[2497.76 --> 2498.58]  It would be
[2498.58 --> 2499.08]  Annoying
[2499.08 --> 2499.40]  But you
[2499.40 --> 2499.72]  Could
[2499.72 --> 2500.42]  You can
[2500.42 --> 2500.84]  Does it
[2500.84 --> 2501.36]  Is that
[2501.36 --> 2501.96]  Supported now
[2501.96 --> 2502.30]  Because I'm
[2502.30 --> 2502.60]  Not aware
[2502.60 --> 2502.90]  Of it
[2502.90 --> 2503.94]  Virtual machine
[2503.94 --> 2505.08]  Over if you
[2505.08 --> 2505.40]  Carried
[2505.40 --> 2505.98]  HDR
[2505.98 --> 2507.34]  With what
[2507.34 --> 2507.76]  Streaming
[2507.76 --> 2508.18]  Platform

[2515.88 --> 2516.40]  HDR
[2516.40 --> 2516.82]  Netflix
[2516.82 --> 2517.18]  No
[2517.18 --> 2517.80]  You can't
[2517.80 --> 2518.22]  Do that
[2518.22 --> 2518.54]  Through
[2518.54 --> 2518.98]  Windows
[2518.98 --> 2519.68]  If you

[2520.32 --> 2520.70]  Through
[2520.70 --> 2521.20]  Anyways
[2521.20 --> 2521.58]  Sure
[2521.58 --> 2521.94]  But then
[2521.94 --> 2522.22]  Now you're
[2522.22 --> 2522.50]  Buying a
[2522.50 --> 2522.74]  Windows
[2522.74 --> 2523.22]  License
[2523.22 --> 2523.76]  Oh

[2636.60 --> 2636.80]  That
[2636.80 --> 2637.10]  Already
[2637.10 --> 2637.28]  I
[2637.28 --> 2637.40]  Could
[2637.40 --> 2637.52]  Do
[2637.52 --> 2637.68]  That
[2637.68 --> 2638.04]  Today

[2640.50 --> 2640.64]  Little
[2640.64 --> 2640.88]  Bit
[2640.88 --> 2641.52]  Confused

[2643.46 --> 2644.64]  Something
[2644.64 --> 2644.98]  That's
[2644.98 --> 2645.28]  Easily
[2645.28 --> 2645.52]  Done

[2702.42 --> 2703.12]  Like
[2703.12 --> 2703.24]  You
[2703.24 --> 2703.50]  Can't
[2703.50 --> 2703.74]  Just
[2703.74 --> 2704.14]  Buy
[2704.14 --> 2704.30]  The
[2704.30 --> 2704.66]  Cheapest

[2706.50 --> 2706.94]  Have
[2706.94 --> 2707.06]  A
[2707.06 --> 2707.44]  Controller

[2707.86 --> 2708.18]  I
[2708.18 --> 2708.38]  Am
[2708.38 --> 2709.36]  Feature
[2709.36 --> 2710.06]  Equivalent
[2710.06 --> 2710.40]  You
[2710.40 --> 2710.54]  Could
[2710.54 --> 2710.70]  Just
[2710.70 --> 2710.88]  Buy
[2710.88 --> 2711.02]  A
[2711.02 --> 2711.28]  Steam
[2711.28 --> 2711.90]  Controller
[2711.90 --> 2713.56]  You
[2713.56 --> 2713.72]  Mean
[2713.72 --> 2713.82]  The
[2713.82 --> 2713.96]  Old

[2715.86 --> 2716.04]  The
[2716.04 --> 2716.20]  New
[2716.20 --> 2716.34]  One
[2716.34 --> 2716.64]  Not

[2717.64 --> 2717.74]  Do
[2717.74 --> 2718.64]  It
[2722.08 --> 2722.18]  So
[2752.08 --> 2754.28]  More
[2754.28 --> 2754.42]  Than
[2754.42 --> 2754.56]  $500
[2754.56 --> 2755.94]  I'm
[2755.94 --> 2756.12]  Not
[2756.12 --> 2756.58]  Excited
[2756.58 --> 2757.80]  It's
[2757.80 --> 2758.24]  Okay
[2758.24 --> 2759.14]  But
[2759.14 --> 2759.32]  It's
[2759.32 --> 2759.50]  Not
[2759.50 --> 2760.16]  Exciting
[2760.16 --> 2760.68]  To
[2760.68 --> 2760.90]  Me
[2760.90 --> 2761.46]  To
[2761.46 --> 2761.56]  Me
[2761.56 --> 2761.70]  The
[2761.70 --> 2762.10]  Exciting
[2762.10 --> 2762.34]  Part
[2762.34 --> 2762.50]  Is
[2762.50 --> 2762.68]  Just
[2762.68 --> 2762.96]  Steam
[2762.96 --> 2763.20]  OS
[2763.20 --> 2763.38]  On
[2763.38 --> 2763.72]  More
[2763.72 --> 2765.12]  Pieces
[2765.12 --> 2765.28]  Of
[2765.28 --> 2765.60]  Hardware
[2765.60 --> 2767.48]  That
[2767.48 --> 2767.58]  Are
[2767.58 --> 2767.74]  Being
[2767.74 --> 2768.00]  Sold
[2768.00 --> 2768.16]  To
[2768.16 --> 2768.44]  People
[2768.44 --> 2769.22]  Yeah
[2769.22 --> 2769.50]  And
[2769.50 --> 2769.76]  That's
[2769.76 --> 2770.12]  Cool
[2770.12 --> 2771.06]  And
[2771.06 --> 2771.38]  You
[2771.38 --> 2771.50]  Know
[2771.50 --> 2771.84]  I'm
[2771.84 --> 2772.26]  Still
[2772.26 --> 2772.88]  You
[2772.88 --> 2773.04]  Know
[2773.04 --> 2773.48]  Four
[2773.48 --> 2773.78]  Years
[2773.78 --> 2774.06]  Later
[2774.06 --> 2774.64]  Very
[2774.64 --> 2775.14]  Excited
[2775.14 --> 2775.56]  For
[2775.56 --> 2776.00]  Steam
[2776.00 --> 2776.26]  OS
[2776.26 --> 2776.42]  To
[2776.42 --> 2776.70]  Become
[2776.70 --> 2776.92]  A
[2776.92 --> 2777.04]  More
[2777.04 --> 2777.30]  Main
[2777.30 --> 2777.72]  Thing
[2777.72 --> 2777.94]  That's
[2777.94 --> 2778.18]  Easier
[2778.18 --> 2778.36]  To
[2778.36 --> 2778.72]  Install
[2778.72 --> 2778.92]  On
[2778.92 --> 2779.02]  A
[2779.02 --> 2779.60]  Wide
[2779.60 --> 2779.88]  Range
[2779.88 --> 2780.00]  Of
[2780.00 --> 2780.30]  Hardware
[2782.08 --> 2789.04]  of like what i need in in my life if it doesn't come with aggressive pricing and it was a little
[2789.04 --> 2793.20]  surprising to me that it wasn't going to be priced like a console because the steam deck
[2793.92 --> 2801.92]  pretty much was and still is you look at it compared to you know the aya neos and the rog
[2801.92 --> 2808.48]  allies of the world and they are undercutting them significantly but valve made the strategic
[2808.48 --> 2814.90]  decision in this case not to do custom silicon that would yield them a large savings over a very
[2814.90 --> 2820.32]  large volume product which tells me you know a couple of things one is that they don't necessarily
[2820.32 --> 2826.68]  know if this is going to be a high volume product this or it tells me that they don't even want to
[2826.68 --> 2831.50]  interfere with the ecosystem which you know was part of the conversation that we had even though
[2831.50 --> 2837.68]  they couldn't give me like like firm reasons around everything interesting yeah i mean they've had much
[2837.68 --> 2843.14]  stronger partnerships with especially playstation but also xbox recently so maybe they're like
[2843.14 --> 2849.36]  kind of semi joining the space but trying to do it in a fairly friendly way and that would be true to
[2849.36 --> 2855.02]  the original vision for steam machine like if you recall steam machine the one that i have the like
[2855.02 --> 2861.62]  the like prototype like wide boy one that was not a real product they launched with partners like
[2861.62 --> 2869.74]  alienware you could make it in that box of course i am come on man come on by the way uh i just looked
[2869.74 --> 2873.78]  this up i don't know if it's the same one that got linked to you there's a few threads that i found
[2873.78 --> 2880.24]  talking oh yeah there we go um and somebody already said that it like works with uh steam deck
[2880.24 --> 2885.88]  oh interesting and apparently it advertises somewhere that it's like uh compatible with
[2885.88 --> 2892.92]  yeah mac os oh now they say linux okay usb 2.0 is a disappointment um so i'll have to i'll have to
[2892.92 --> 2897.34]  look around there might also be other ones i don't know i'll have to see what's out there but um but
[2897.34 --> 2903.24]  that's definitely something that we'd have to we'd have to factor in yeah someone in in twitch chat uh
[2903.24 --> 2908.28]  just said dark horse said pulse 8 yeah these guys are legit and i've seen a few threads talking about
[2908.28 --> 2915.16]  maybe they have a different one that's not you know 2.0 anymore i don't know man i'm i'm excited
[2915.16 --> 2921.86]  for the idea of the year of the linux desktop what i'm not excited about is it not having a console
[2921.86 --> 2927.80]  like price and the other thing that's great about consoles is the way that they tend to plummet in
[2927.80 --> 2933.84]  value like yeah this will have that problem i suspect you well no no no i don't think it will
[2933.84 --> 2938.22]  really because it's a pc i just the reason why i think so is just because it's like
[2938.22 --> 2944.30]  already slow and old you think so okay that's kind of a hot take people don't like people calling it
[2944.30 --> 2949.82]  slow and old uh hubs sort of under fire for calling it i think slow and old or something like that
[2949.82 --> 2958.42]  really yeah as a newly as a device that's coming out next year that feels based on what we expect
[2958.42 --> 2964.90]  the price will be that feels true to me uh mr faray uh usb 2 did i say usb 2 was a disappointment
[2964.90 --> 2970.98]  i meant hdmi 2 was a disappointment i'd like it to be 2.1 at this point um that that dongle
[2970.98 --> 2980.54]  the the usb doesn't matter um all right i'm not no okay so to be clear uh that 2500k system that i
[2980.54 --> 2986.90]  mentioned on i think last one show is playing arc raiders right now right so being old doesn't
[2986.90 --> 2992.90]  necessarily even mean that big of a deal i just think it's not the cpu i'm worried about exactly it's
[2992.90 --> 2997.30]  600 8 gig gpu and the fact that valve is even talking about 4k on it
[2997.30 --> 3004.88]  in fairness to them they did attach that to upscaling they are being very upfront yeah that they mean
[3004.88 --> 3014.98]  with fsr which basically means not 4k not actually yeah um but like we are we are probably what two
[3014.98 --> 3020.96]  years now from playstation 6 which means we're probably three to four years from games that are
[3020.96 --> 3027.22]  actually going to leverage playstation 6 hardware um meaning that valve has kind of like a half a
[3027.22 --> 3033.80]  console generation before they can't with a straight face say yeah it'll run basically you
[3033.80 --> 3040.26]  know high-end games on steam at 4k 60 fps with fsr because all the fsr in the world is not going to
[3040.26 --> 3044.40]  make a playstation 6 game it just sucks that that's going to be true for such a short period of time
[3044.40 --> 3051.12]  like you're saying exactly but mr nick 88 in twitch chat did also say quote from valve engineer uh
[3051.12 --> 3058.50]  yazan aldehyat i think i hope sure um the steam machine is equal to or better than what 70 percent
[3058.50 --> 3061.90]  of people have at home and that's an interesting comment because it's not
[3061.90 --> 3072.86]  it's so open that it will like if you if i think about the types of games that i'm usually going
[3072.86 --> 3080.62]  to want to be playing on my tv it will probably be fine for a significantly longer period of time yeah
[3080.62 --> 3085.38]  you can play the crap out of castle crashers exactly your steam machine exactly most like couch co-op
[3085.38 --> 3092.58]  things what's that rv game uh moving out oh no that's the different rv there yet yeah that that
[3092.58 --> 3098.96]  game i'm sure it'll run completely fine but also moving out um sure you know overcooked like yeah all
[3098.96 --> 3104.14]  those games will be no problem for basically like ever what's that mario party clone but like more
[3104.14 --> 3109.54]  violent you know the one i'm talking about right he would know pummel party yeah pummel party like
[3109.54 --> 3115.32]  stuff like that's gonna run on it no problem right so to be clear i'm not saying it's
[3115.32 --> 3122.42]  like bad no i'm just saying that i'm just saying that compared to a playstation 5 which i can
[3122.42 --> 3126.62]  literally get on facebook marketplace for like what did i pay for the one in scrapyard wars
[3126.62 --> 3133.04]  like less than 400 canadian dollars yeah yeah that's tough uh that's tough that's tough and there
[3133.04 --> 3141.00]  are benefits to a device like that over this like for instance being able to stream protected content
[3141.00 --> 3145.08]  which and i get it i know our audiences there's a lot of piracy there's a lot of
[3145.08 --> 3151.56]  sailing the sailing the high seas yes but that's not everybody right and so we do have to acknowledge
[3151.56 --> 3157.92]  that for a lot of people the steam machine is not just going to be a no-brainer like no obviously
[3157.92 --> 3161.72]  anything else is stupid i think another thing that'll hurt it and i i didn't articulate this
[3161.72 --> 3167.60]  earlier but i did mean to earlier i just forgot um is that i don't think this is gonna have
[3167.60 --> 3177.32]  uh a almost unique-less value it is cool it's it's the first steam machine that's actually publicly
[3177.32 --> 3183.38]  available it has steam os all that kind of stuff for sale well i mean there were the old ones they
[3183.38 --> 3187.18]  were for sale oh i didn't even know that yeah nobody bought them okay yeah i didn't know they
[3187.18 --> 3193.66]  actually went for sale uh i thought anyways whatever um something about old consoles that keeps their value
[3193.66 --> 3201.26]  is the like there are probably games that only work on this or it had a very unique experience
[3201.26 --> 3206.28]  for some particular reason so the way that they drop because there's so many of them but then they
[3206.28 --> 3209.92]  hold and then they'll go up and then they'll eventually i don't think that's gonna happen here
[3209.92 --> 3212.80]  exactly it's just gonna be an old computer yes which
[3212.80 --> 3221.54]  yeah we'll see how it goes i find old computers will it again they'll drop and they'll hold for a
[3221.54 --> 3227.80]  long time but then they just plummet they'll hit a wall where it's like this just kind of sucks now
[3227.80 --> 3232.16]  it's not getting driver updates anymore these various things are happening i mean and then get
[3232.16 --> 3237.46]  ditched linux though the fact that it runs linux and you don't have to worry about microsoft just like
[3237.46 --> 3241.92]  rug pulling your ability to boot the latest os that's getting that might help it be
[3241.92 --> 3246.50]  more legit for longer yeah i think there's gonna be a lot at play in its ability to hold value
[3246.50 --> 3253.94]  for sure baby okay the last thing before we bring elijah on and talk about linus x linus is the steam
[3253.94 --> 3261.10]  controller yes specifically the name so i took a bit of a shot at valve for calling the steam controller
[3261.10 --> 3267.18]  steam controller when they already have a product called steam controller
[3267.18 --> 3275.92]  they sure do they sure do like if you google steam controller it says steam controller on steam
[3275.92 --> 3281.50]  the picture is the old one you click on it and it's right there they did add 2015 now
[3281.50 --> 3287.74]  yeah so i did take a little bit of flack for this in the comments as well that's a stupid
[3287.74 --> 3293.62]  that's a stupid critique linus that one has been long discontinued there's no way that anyone
[3293.62 --> 3299.26]  would get confused about it when the new one is like you know obviously the new one i googled steam
[3299.26 --> 3311.36]  controller and my response to that is no this is unconscionable this is not okay nothing can ever
[3311.36 --> 3318.46]  be named the same thing exactly as another product because it serves literally no purpose other than to
[3318.46 --> 3325.32]  be confusing so counterpoint you're right in the near future there won't be a ton of confusion
[3325.32 --> 3331.72]  because all the seo will be towards the new one yeah okay well here's something what if you have an
[3331.72 --> 3336.88]  old one and you're trying to do a battery swap or something like that on it well i guess go f**k
[3336.88 --> 3344.40]  yourself cool also what about 10 years from now when they are both old and obsolete and you are trying
[3344.40 --> 3350.70]  to find information you're trying to find a how-to guide or you're trying to well i mean yeah that's
[3350.70 --> 3354.88]  that's the biggest one is it pretty much my my objection to this comes down to ease of finding
[3354.88 --> 3361.62]  information and right to repair calling something the exact same thing is completely unnecessary
[3361.62 --> 3370.06]  completely unnecessary and can lead to nothing but confusion and when i asked valve point blank
[3370.06 --> 3377.36]  why did you do this they said it was because it would reduce confusion
[3377.36 --> 3389.50]  that was actually the f**king reason which to me i i i don't i don't accept in to play devil's
[3389.50 --> 3396.62]  advocate sure apple's done this forever yeah which is exactly what i brought up and they acknowledged
[3396.62 --> 3402.34]  what a problem it is and i do think considering the amount of steam controllers out there especially
[3402.34 --> 3407.86]  that are still in use this might actually reduce confusion because the amount of people the amount
[3407.86 --> 3413.96]  of people that will have the new one and just not even know the old one existed but tell me this
[3413.96 --> 3419.70]  if they called it steam controller 2 it would have been fine how would that confuse anybody
[3419.70 --> 3424.54]  i don't necessarily think it would i have a fun thing though that's going to hurt some people's
[3424.54 --> 3429.48]  brains is this actually how it works does the usbc port not line up with the little led thing don't
[3429.48 --> 3438.30]  worry about it what get this get this what no you can't move on from that yeah we're not we're not
[3438.30 --> 3444.08]  bring that back we're not done yet no we're not going back to that no so when i talked to them i was
[3444.08 --> 3452.42]  like look guys do you want to be microsoft like do you want to have stupid naming schemes that don't
[3452.42 --> 3458.36]  make any sense or like look you know look at one of the other players in the console space
[3458.36 --> 3465.08]  sony hasn't run into fucking confusion okay by calling the playstation 2 playstation 2 here's a
[3465.08 --> 3468.78]  question for you i'm not done yet why did it not bother you that no i'm not i'm not done
[3468.78 --> 3476.04]  so they didn't run into confusion calling it playstation 3 that's not confusing in spite of
[3476.04 --> 3481.14]  the fact that far more people bought a playstation 2 than a playstation 1 consoles went way more
[3481.14 --> 3486.82]  mainstream especially in the west around playstation 2 like way more it moved so many units that's not
[3486.82 --> 3491.58]  confusing and the same thing i said the same thing dual shock dual shock 2 that's not confusing
[3491.58 --> 3499.46]  nobody's confused and they went well yeah but what about dual sense i'm like yeah what about dual
[3499.46 --> 3506.20]  sense it's got a completely new ergonomic design it has their sense haptic triggers it has a clearly
[3506.20 --> 3512.44]  differentiating feature and also it's not called the same thing it's called dual sense it has a new
[3512.44 --> 3518.20]  name what about steam machine so steam machine's stupid too okay steam machine i don't mind as much
[3518.20 --> 3524.92]  though because literally not a single one still exists like everyone who bought those put windows on
[3524.92 --> 3530.76]  it you literally like can't like that that ancient original steam os that ran on it they used nvidia
[3530.76 --> 3538.20]  gpus back then right like that you literally can't even install new steam os on it steam machine is more
[3538.20 --> 3544.20]  of a concept which or was more of a concept at the beginning you didn't buy a steam machine you bought an
[3544.20 --> 3551.72]  alienware whatever part number and it was listed on steam as a steam machine so this is a steam this is the
[3551.72 --> 3556.44]  first first first party steam machine okay so i can at least kind of get behind that i didn't know it
[3556.44 --> 3560.92]  was like uh there was i remember it was through the oems i thought they had a first party one as well okay
[3560.92 --> 3567.72]  the first party one just went out to press got it to try out steam os and and experience the ecosystem
[3567.72 --> 3573.56]  but it was all third party so that's not that bad so this is one of those things where
[3573.56 --> 3583.48]  the only reason to call something the same thing is to unnecessarily screw up search results which luke
[3583.48 --> 3589.56]  managed to demonstrate far more succinctly and easily than i had even thought to do it dude it was i i was
[3589.56 --> 3596.60]  actually stunned that it came up that way i'm not because this is a serious problem anytime you try to
[3596.60 --> 3604.04]  fix just to just to prove the the first result is the old one the second and it says you visit often
[3604.04 --> 3610.84]  i've only visited today the uh the second result is the new one there is no reason to do this like if
[3610.84 --> 3617.80]  you've ever tried to find what version of ios is supported on an ipad if you don't pay super close
[3617.80 --> 3625.56]  attention and you know like oh this is the late 2017 one or there's like little tiny letters on the back
[3625.56 --> 3630.44]  that you can like pull out a magnifying glass and like search for that specific model and it's just
[3630.44 --> 3637.16]  called ipad it's like worthless if you're trying to replace a screen or a battery or a home button or
[3637.16 --> 3643.32]  whatever the case may be and just find information about the bloody thing that is the only purpose that
[3643.32 --> 3649.08]  it serves and the really infuriating part of it is that apple knows better for their cash cow for the
[3649.08 --> 3655.56]  iphone they all have a clear a clear name that is different from the one before and different from
[3655.56 --> 3661.80]  the one after they're all clearly named it's it's it still fits under clearly named but in my opinion
[3661.80 --> 3667.48]  they faltered for a second with the x but then they came back they came they fixed it at least it had
[3667.48 --> 3672.60]  a name that was not the same as any other i totally agree it just wasn't as good and then they went back
[3672.60 --> 3677.24]  to being good again and to and to be clear apple doesn't do everything perfectly in this regard
[3677.24 --> 3682.84]  either the new se is called 16e instead of just calling it the and and the se's were actually kind
[3682.84 --> 3688.04]  of dumb because they had like se and then se second generation like they have made mistakes i didn't even
[3688.04 --> 3695.56]  know that but those are mistakes those are not okay it's never okay and no it was because i could i
[3695.56 --> 3700.28]  could make the exact same statement we called it steam controller so that it wouldn't be confusing
[3700.28 --> 3706.52]  i could see the exact same thing we called it steam controller 2 so it wouldn't be confusing
[3706.52 --> 3712.60]  which of those actually made more sense to you of course yeah yeah i just i i can't
[3713.88 --> 3718.92]  whenever someone gives you a reason and i use the word reason very loosely here because reason implies
[3718.92 --> 3725.00]  logic and logic is math whenever somebody gives you a reason for their actions that does not logic
[3725.00 --> 3731.48]  logic then what it means is either they're stupid or they're lying those are the only answers and i
[3731.48 --> 3738.84]  don't know what valve's game is here i don't understand this but i don't agree with it and i will never
[3738.84 --> 3744.76]  agree with it no two products should ever be called exactly the same thing ever speaking of not agreeing
[3744.76 --> 3750.68]  with it i i looked up images and references and stuff like that and the usbc port does line up with the
[3750.68 --> 3757.40]  middle of the controller i think that animation that they have is just not correct or maybe the
[3757.40 --> 3764.20]  magnet is off centered oh yeah it's not plugging into usb port no it looks like the magnet centered
[3764.20 --> 3769.16]  it's probably just the graphic i wouldn't worry about that that is like the least oh it will bother
[3769.16 --> 3775.80]  the engagement out of people it will bother people i don't actually remember where it was i'm sure it's
[3775.80 --> 3783.00]  fine it all looks centered i looked it up yeah yeah hey philip lane chat seems to be back oh really
[3783.00 --> 3789.88]  for now maybe for now maybe i'll see how it goes that's fine should we talk about linus x linus yeah
[3791.96 --> 3795.16]  dude it was the best thing ever
[3795.16 --> 3806.60]  i mean it was weird hearing him say that he was glad that luke wasn't here i can join don't even
[3809.40 --> 3813.96]  is this mic on it will be in a second just wait for him to get settled
[3815.48 --> 3819.64]  want to give it a quick tap for me okay wait i actually do think chat is actually properly back
[3819.64 --> 3830.92]  now thank you aj yeah you match nice everyone can you hear okay yeah we we we sprained for the
[3830.92 --> 3836.68]  headphones give me a tippy tap just on the perfect okay hopefully this isn't too loud let's do this
[3836.68 --> 3841.56]  thing none of it speaking of having two things named the same there we go yeah how confusing was that i
[3842.52 --> 3847.64]  i've never really gone through that it was quite funny every single time being like
[3847.64 --> 3852.28]  hey linus and then both would turn every every single time for the whole day
[3854.04 --> 3861.88]  did you guys get really hardcore about linus and linus no oh he actually doesn't agree with that oh
[3861.88 --> 3868.44]  it's only linus if you are speaking swedish to him that totally makes sense to me otherwise he goes by
[3868.44 --> 3874.28]  linus i i called him just because it kind of broke my brain to call anyone else linus
[3874.28 --> 3879.32]  except sometimes i think i called him linus a couple times well you had asked him about it and
[3879.32 --> 3886.44]  then you tried linus for a while then you said linus then you said linus you honestly bounced back and
[3886.44 --> 3892.36]  forth quite a bit between all three it's a hard name debatable it's a hard name very debatable
[3893.40 --> 3898.20]  where the line can you say the word us i mean you'd be surprised how few people can handle it
[3898.20 --> 3905.48]  especially in other languages it's very difficult it's very difficult um so i mean dude i don't even
[3905.48 --> 3909.00]  know i don't even really know where to start with this um if you weren't paying attention or you're
[3909.00 --> 3916.68]  just joining the show now we had the one and only linus torvalds the creator of the linux kernel uh here
[3916.68 --> 3922.76]  to shoot a collaborative video this week we reached out to him saying hey um what do you think would you
[3922.76 --> 3930.28]  like to do a video together got back the weirdest response ever oh dude it was very strange oh
[3930.28 --> 3933.88]  awesome you should stop bringing that up and down because it's a lot of mic movement you might just
[3933.88 --> 3939.16]  have to kind of hold it okay yep sorry sir i could handling noises my bad sir no you're great um cut a
[3939.16 --> 3944.68]  lot of it out so you probably hear more than they do oh cool um we go linus linus it's linus yeah
[3944.68 --> 3956.04]  so he basically said without accepting or declining well the only way for this to work would be for it to
[3956.04 --> 3964.60]  um something something there can be only one like the the hit 80s movie highlander or two men enter
[3964.60 --> 3971.56]  one man leaves like mad max and so i basically responded with i don't know what to make of these
[3971.56 --> 3975.72]  i'm gonna give myself the homework of watching these old movies i've never seen and i will get
[3975.72 --> 3981.24]  back to you which it took me a very long time because i don't find a ton of time to watch movies
[3981.24 --> 3987.96]  and then eventually i did and it turns out that he had meant yes yeah we actually found out while he
[3987.96 --> 3995.80]  was here that he has a very interesting approach to email oh yeah i suspect he has an interesting
[3995.80 --> 4000.36]  approach to a lot of feel free to participate well i i don't want to interrupt you well no i mean
[4000.36 --> 4003.56]  yeah you're hanging around late at work to participate why don't you tell the email he's
[4003.56 --> 4009.08]  very different than our linus where our linus might take anywhere between four minutes and four
[4009.08 --> 4016.44]  business months to respond to an email uh mr linus torvalds has says if i don't respond in 15 minutes
[4016.44 --> 4021.40]  probably wasn't important anyways and then you're not going to get a response and then he archives it
[4021.40 --> 4026.44]  and he's like if it's important enough don't follow up again and then i'll respond then based so he
[4026.44 --> 4030.68]  almost responded like within it was definitely within 15 minutes of your original email yeah which
[4030.68 --> 4037.08]  i was floored by and then what he said was like yeah well it was either that or not and i was like oh
[4037.96 --> 4044.12]  well i'm glad i was important enough to that i think that's based and then you guys set up a call and
[4044.12 --> 4054.36]  did some talking and and here we are okay out of 10 how cool was it like a 17. dude like we have some
[4054.36 --> 4059.32]  footage on your phone of us in the lobby because he gave me the access to his uber to see like
[4059.32 --> 4064.12]  whereabouts he was so we could just keep track and i was like watching it like a hawk well first so
[4064.12 --> 4068.92]  nervous first we were freaking out because he was what half an hour early an hour early oh yeah he's
[4068.92 --> 4073.56]  like super early so we're sitting there like the set's not ready we're not ready to shoot this linus
[4073.56 --> 4078.68]  is still in the middle of a meeting right now what are we gonna how are we gonna do this so finally
[4078.68 --> 4083.96]  about five minutes before he's showing up linus and i walk down to the front lobby and we're just
[4083.96 --> 4089.08]  kind of like pacing back and forth like waiting we're like what do we do how do we open this
[4089.08 --> 4094.44]  well we were standing on the set and i was like dude what is the point of us trying to play this cool
[4095.08 --> 4103.32]  we might as well just wait for him on the doorstep because yep we want to yep and uh so maybe that
[4103.32 --> 4107.24]  footage will make it onto float plane at some point of us just i think there's i do think there's stuff
[4107.24 --> 4113.88]  coming yeah oh oh yeah no there's actually uh sammy already has um there's already something behind
[4113.88 --> 4123.16]  the scenes up on float plane right now uh let me have a look actually two already uh behind the scenes
[4123.72 --> 4129.00]  uh shooting the intro for the collab so we ended up uh here's a bit of a spoiler we went with highlander
[4129.00 --> 4137.00]  there can be only one um so we do like kind of a a goofy sword fight thing here's some pictures
[4137.24 --> 4143.64]  only get samurai swords i unfortunately couldn't get broad swords like the movie yeah yeah um so
[4143.64 --> 4150.76]  we'll have all that we have all that up on float plane right now um man how can you be that much of
[4150.76 --> 4157.72]  a chad and still genuinely that humble but also know how important you are oh yeah because he definitely
[4157.72 --> 4165.96]  knows how important he is or how important his contribution has been but he's just i don't know
[4165.96 --> 4170.84]  it was like kind of hanging out with like someone's dad like he's just very down to earth yeah it got
[4170.84 --> 4178.12]  really comfortable really quickly like we were except me i asked you i was like was fallon or this like
[4178.12 --> 4184.20]  more what were you more nervous for oh this yeah not even close i like fallon's a celebrity
[4184.20 --> 4191.64]  but torvalds in our space is a dramatically bigger deal like we like we were we were talking about
[4191.64 --> 4197.48]  it elijah and i both were like okay well this is it then i i actually can't see any other peak of like
[4197.48 --> 4203.32]  having a guest do a type of video like have him back the first thing that other people will say is okay
[4203.32 --> 4209.24]  well what about bill gates and it's like no you got to be kidding me that that was exact response yeah
[4209.24 --> 4215.88]  exactly not even close it's like why not some why not some other billionaire yeah actually actually
[4215.88 --> 4223.72]  though no like this is this is it was unbelievably cool i think that gaben would be would be close for
[4223.72 --> 4231.16]  me oh for sure torvalds gaben you gotta go we haven't talked about this topic yet but you gotta go
[4231.16 --> 4238.04]  meet gaben on his yacht um 364 foot yes please wasniak oh
[4239.56 --> 4246.60]  would be very cool but less meaningful to me i i wasn't into apple like then when he was with the
[4246.60 --> 4251.24]  company i was like has a lot to do with the introduction of the personal computer he does
[4251.24 --> 4257.00]  wasniak it would be super cool that would be super cool but like there's not man there's not you just
[4257.00 --> 4261.64]  got to email him you got to email him that's all you did for this one and we got the collab we've
[4261.64 --> 4265.56]  talked about this after now it's like dude how many cold emails should we just start sending yeah
[4265.56 --> 4272.04]  i actually i asked him too though i was like i or i don't remember exactly what i said but i was
[4272.04 --> 4279.48]  like i can't i basically told him i was like i can't believe it was this easy all i i i i spent my
[4279.48 --> 4286.12]  entire career obviously knowing who he was how spammed he's gonna get now he brought that up he'll just
[4286.12 --> 4292.20]  ignore it yeah dude he he was like yeah basically he talked about how as far as i can tell ignoring
[4292.20 --> 4297.08]  things is his superpower same as how i can't see ads he just can't see an email he doesn't care about
[4297.08 --> 4302.60]  and he'll just does he archive himself or does it just auto archive past a certain period of time he
[4302.60 --> 4306.20]  says he'll archive it i don't know what that means yeah i'm not sure what that means i mean
[4306.20 --> 4313.00]  all in the column archive it i'm later i'm sure that someone like that could come up with a script
[4313.00 --> 4321.08]  this is archiving assistant if you really wanted to yeah um but like the i i i basically couldn't wrap
[4321.08 --> 4327.16]  my brain around the fact that because obviously i've always been aware of the other you know you know
[4327.16 --> 4333.48]  the actual tech tech linus right yeah yeah yeah and the fact that just me being too shy
[4334.60 --> 4340.76]  to ask was the only reason it took this long that was the barrier of entry that was the barrier it was
[4341.56 --> 4345.80]  genuinely so much fun and so cool and like just even walking around the studio with him kind of
[4345.80 --> 4350.76]  giving him an example of like this is what we do because he didn't necessarily even fully grasp it
[4350.76 --> 4356.44]  until he was here like what a youtube media company sure was like right it is weird it's very yeah
[4356.44 --> 4360.28]  like in the history of media it is very strange and as we kept walking he was like wow this place
[4360.28 --> 4366.76]  just keeps going like that was like it was cool that he was gent he seemed and and i and i i don't
[4366.76 --> 4373.08]  think he'd bother to pretend but he seemed genuinely interested did you bring him to the lab i didn't
[4373.08 --> 4377.96]  we only had a limited amount of time with him i know i know we only had a limited we did invite lab
[4377.96 --> 4384.12]  people over to come meet him though okay yeah um i knew about that but i was i know uh which that will
[4384.12 --> 4391.00]  be a separate float plane video as well there's kind of like a 15 minute kind of staff it was very
[4391.00 --> 4397.00]  because i it was after the shoot and i was just like guys just like go up oh dude people were like
[4397.00 --> 4401.96]  hovering well yeah like i was like like honestly he's probably quite used to that
[4403.96 --> 4409.88]  yeah he wasn't awkward though it's it's funny because as part of my prep for this i read his
[4409.88 --> 4418.04]  autobiography and i um he didn't believe me until like the fourth time i referenced it i think yeah
[4418.04 --> 4423.16]  you had asked some questions from it or some guiding questions and he was like oh you actually
[4423.16 --> 4431.48]  did read the book it was quite funny um so so yeah in in prepping for it so so he wrote it over 20 years
[4431.48 --> 4436.60]  ago though and he talks a lot about like how much trouble he has with public speaking and how awkward
[4436.60 --> 4442.12]  he is or whatever and i was like well either he has done a ton since then a lot has changed in 20 years
[4442.12 --> 4446.92]  or uh you weren't as awkward as you thought you were you hide it well or whatever every time he
[4446.92 --> 4452.52]  opened his mouth he was very eloquent and it was super interesting like he's one of those people that's
[4452.52 --> 4462.52]  just like well there's no way that i'm the smartest person in this room because it's that guy um and it
[4462.52 --> 4469.64]  was it was just super cool everything he said was just seemed so well considered even if we were kind
[4469.64 --> 4474.76]  of trying to blindside him with something he still took the time to process it and then like give an
[4474.76 --> 4479.96]  actually good response and we were like wow okay like we couldn't even trip him we memed him with like
[4479.96 --> 4485.64]  xbox versus playstation and he like gave us a thoughtful response and it's like all right
[4486.28 --> 4491.72]  yeah it was it was very great the hardest part about this video i think is going to be cutting
[4491.72 --> 4498.20]  it into a video and not because there's not enough content there's too much you just gotta dump it on
[4498.20 --> 4502.92]  flow plane uh speaking of which question from the now working flow plane chat archangel of death said
[4502.92 --> 4512.28]  did he know about ltt before your email so this is funny i specifically asked him if he had seen the
[4512.28 --> 4518.92]  video that we did a number of years ago where we followed the guide from zd net or a parts list
[4518.92 --> 4524.76]  really from zd net and we built linus torvalds computer like we built the same spec and we were like
[4524.76 --> 4530.52]  if you build this you'll have the same pc as linus torvalds and i was like have you seen it he's like
[4530.52 --> 4541.56]  like drew a complete blank but the two other flipping youtubers that i happened to mention
[4542.20 --> 4549.48]  okay i mentioned meddy electro boom yeah yeah immediately he's like oh yeah electro boom awesome
[4549.48 --> 4557.64]  yeah he's local i'm like okay ego destroyed and then meddy up and then i should have actually no i didn't
[4557.64 --> 4565.00]  and then just because i was just kind of i was kind of talking about how it kind of blew his mind
[4565.00 --> 4570.92]  that we were more of a physical goods company than we are a media company these days and i was like we
[4570.92 --> 4574.60]  were i was just kind of chatting with them and i kind of brought up that that's not even that unique
[4574.60 --> 4582.52]  anymore like this creator economy is is incredibly cool and so i pulled out i pulled out this uh this is
[4582.52 --> 4591.08]  my new box cutter from evan and caitlin and um they showed it to me at vidcon and i was just like
[4591.64 --> 4598.36]  that is too cool for you to give it to me i will buy one it's super expensive but it's like extremely
[4598.36 --> 4607.32]  satisfying you just can't handle it can you up up there we go so you slide it forward and then let it go
[4607.32 --> 4614.12]  yep and then slide it back oh okay yeah i thought you slid it forward again to pull it back no yeah
[4614.12 --> 4620.52]  super cool um so i showed it to him and he's like oh yeah those guys they make the like the resin
[4620.52 --> 4626.12]  pumpkin so you asked him about one of our videos did you ask him about our channel he then acknowledged
[4626.12 --> 4633.48]  that he had heard of us okay okay so he didn't completely destroy my ego but it's just like i pull two
[4633.48 --> 4640.36]  sort of not random because obviously they're they're tech adjacent and big creators but he like
[4640.36 --> 4647.64]  immediately was like oh yeah those guys it was very funny yeah i have to ask you if you can say it
[4647.64 --> 4652.84]  without spoiling what was the highlight like if you can pinpoint one specific moment
[4652.84 --> 4665.56]  it's really tough i have one it's so hard because there's like kind of what's a what's a personal
[4665.56 --> 4671.48]  highlight like the fact that he genuinely thought what we're doing is cool yeah that's pretty sweet
[4671.48 --> 4677.24]  that was amazing because if he thinks it's cool then it's cool yeah as far as i'm concerned that's
[4677.24 --> 4684.84]  pretty huge um but like that's a respectable favorite point but like i mean i just thought
[4684.84 --> 4691.56]  how cool he was was also cool like the fact that he's so no i'm serious no i hear you like the fact
[4691.56 --> 4699.40]  that without a moment of hesitation you know i was like it's totally fine to say no would it be okay
[4699.40 --> 4705.40]  you have a you have some pretty big fans here to hang around longer and just chat and he was so
[4705.40 --> 4713.48]  generous with his time during that he didn't have to talk to anybody he waited until like the kind of
[4713.48 --> 4719.24]  energy died down before being like okay i guess i can head out now he he read the room yeah like super
[4719.24 --> 4727.80]  hard they say never meet your heroes right meet this one but meet this one because he's so cool and and
[4727.80 --> 4736.92]  there was i literally just from the second like he introduced himself it was just i don't know it was
[4736.92 --> 4746.28]  great vibes yeah yeah yeah and so that was a super huge highlight um i i mean there
[4747.96 --> 4754.20]  this will be kind of a weird one but getting him to cringe at my dad jokes oh that was so funny was so
[4754.20 --> 4760.20]  fun yeah you cracking dad jokes and then him either not immediately realizing it or realizing
[4760.20 --> 4766.68]  it immediately and going like actually deep sighing he called out your segways a couple times which was
[4766.68 --> 4771.56]  really funny he's like oh so he does know the channel yeah he was like oh that that was segue yeah
[4771.56 --> 4778.52]  that was cool very cool um like is that enough is that enough like peak tier highlights for you like
[4778.52 --> 4784.12]  it goes on and on i have one that i think was my highlight it was after the shoot after the meet
[4784.12 --> 4790.20]  and greet we went and said goodbye to you yeah uh i candidly was just like i'd be happy to give you
[4790.20 --> 4796.52]  a ride back to your hotel which was about a 25 minute drive from the office pretty much in completely
[4796.52 --> 4802.20]  the opposite direction of where my home was but i got a 25 minute one-on-one that's so conversation with
[4802.20 --> 4807.40]  him that's so sick and like that's something that is going to be forever ingrained even if i have
[4807.40 --> 4812.12]  another concussion i can't possibly forget that because it's just so cool and that's so sick and
[4812.12 --> 4817.48]  that's what i mean even too about being generous with his time because he could have just been like
[4818.12 --> 4823.08]  you know what i'm socialed out today i've done it i've done it i've been like you know what it would be
[4823.08 --> 4830.12]  fair and that would be totally fine to do that but instead he's like no i'm gonna hang around on set
[4830.12 --> 4836.60]  and talk to randoms that i've never met you know or whatever i'm gonna i'll i'll accept the i'll accept
[4836.60 --> 4840.76]  the ride because you never know when you accept a ride from someone like you know maybe they try
[4840.76 --> 4845.16]  and corner you with a business pitch or something like that like totally yeah it happens it happens
[4845.72 --> 4851.08]  and and i could see having your guard up about something like that but whether it's just not
[4851.08 --> 4860.12]  giving any fucks or whether it's like just being at a point in your career where you're just he was very
[4860.12 --> 4866.28]  open to new experiences which was once yeah try anything once he said that a lot of times um
[4867.64 --> 4874.12]  and and and as far as i can tell the try anything once is basically the reason he did it yeah he's
[4874.12 --> 4880.76]  like i've never i've never done a youtube video before i've never seen this before and he talked about
[4880.76 --> 4888.92]  how being the linux guy has unlocked experiences for him um he talked about going to a pre-oscar party
[4888.92 --> 4895.40]  he talked about like riding on a fighter jet and just like i i kept kind of ribbing him i was like
[4895.96 --> 4900.28]  right so that's what you're yeah that's what you're comparing to this right like we're up there we're
[4900.28 --> 4912.20]  being in a youtube video right and um i don't know dude i i it's just i was more tired after the
[4912.20 --> 4921.00]  end of that day than i have been after work in a long time not because i was like down about anything
[4921.00 --> 4928.36]  we were doing but just because being that excited and having that much fun for an entire day is honestly
[4928.36 --> 4934.76]  pretty tiring yeah i slept for about four minutes before that like night because i was so nervous i
[4934.76 --> 4939.96]  was in and out of like a dream of like replaying the shoot in my head over and over like wanting to
[4939.96 --> 4944.28]  make sure everything was going right because obviously i i have my name tied to it so i'm like
[4944.28 --> 4953.40]  if this is bad i'm bad so um when i got home i also just i was done uh it's over
[4953.40 --> 4958.44]  well actually i had to post the other valve video if you got home from dropping off linus torvald yeah
[4960.44 --> 4965.24]  i have no idea how i'm ever gonna peak that like maybe i can give obama or like someone else a ride
[4965.24 --> 4972.68]  i wouldn't peak it he i know he flashes his phone to me and he's like how many people have this this
[4972.68 --> 4977.48]  profile picture in their recent message history there's quite a common podcast flex question of
[4977.48 --> 4983.80]  like who's the most famous person in your phone i now have the most famous person in my opinion
[4983.80 --> 4989.00]  in my phone that's really cool i'm never ever gonna text it because yeah i'm like way too late
[4989.00 --> 4993.72]  yeah never gonna cross that line you gotta like frame it oh dude it's somehow get it like a special
[4993.72 --> 4999.56]  border or something did you right beside him so i'm gonna get a screenshot even even if someone else that
[4999.56 --> 5006.76]  someone had in their phone was more famous i think that i think consequential is the word that i would
[5006.76 --> 5012.52]  sort of apply most to linus torvalds because i mean he'll be the first to tell you that the the
[5012.52 --> 5019.16]  linux kernel these days is like a fraction of a percent code that he actually wrote sure he's mostly
[5019.16 --> 5027.56]  the guy that that makes sure that everyone else's contributions are are are meaningful and are correct
[5027.56 --> 5032.68]  and are uh and are and are moving linux in the right direction moving the kernel in the right direction
[5032.68 --> 5038.44]  because he's he's he's he's the kernel guy and he's like yeah at some point i i had to i had to which
[5038.44 --> 5047.48]  is almost certainly an extremely good thing because as with us all unfortunately somehow he's still mortal
[5047.48 --> 5054.20]  um so he's gonna pass at some point yeah and we're gonna need a good example of the types of things that
[5054.20 --> 5063.48]  he would want to happen but consequential no yeah absolutely like would you would you i mean like
[5063.48 --> 5069.40]  think of a celebrity dwayne the rock johnson probably more famous than linus torvalds oh yeah more
[5069.40 --> 5076.84]  consequential no yeah like yeah i mean it's like absolutely funny yeah like i can smell what he's
[5076.84 --> 5085.08]  cooking but it ain't as important as linux yeah it's very very yeah i mean no one watching this is
[5085.08 --> 5088.36]  gonna have a problem with that but i was gonna say like if you had a problem with that like please look
[5088.36 --> 5095.40]  up the amount of things around the world that move because of linux yeah oh dude the phone the android
[5095.40 --> 5105.32]  phone in your pocket your prime example mac less so sort of uh less so heavily inspired by um but the
[5105.32 --> 5111.16]  the android phone in your pocket yes absolutely underpins android like heavily for sure but you're
[5111.16 --> 5114.04]  talking about consequence would it exist in the form that is now without it
[5116.92 --> 5125.00]  because consequence can be indirect and direct okay okay uh equivocal equivocal says no mention of git
[5125.00 --> 5129.72]  either we did actually talk about git we asked him which was his his favorite child that one i'm not
[5129.72 --> 5136.52]  going to spoil yeah uh so make sure you guys watch this video because the building the computer that's
[5136.52 --> 5143.48]  the title of the video but it is the least important part of the video and whether it ends up being a 25
[5143.48 --> 5149.56]  minute long video or whether it ends up being an hour and a half video we don't know yet uh whatever
[5149.56 --> 5155.16]  doesn't make it into the youtube cut is going to end up on float plane but right now elijah and i are
[5155.16 --> 5161.00]  leaning towards a super long youtube cut with uh there will still be some stuff that's just not
[5161.00 --> 5166.92]  going to make the youtube cut um so that'll be over on float plane uh but we're leaning towards just a
[5166.92 --> 5173.00]  long ass video because it it was awesome and it's interesting to try too to see if there's an appetite
[5173.00 --> 5180.36]  for like you know these kind of long unfiltered podcasty almost style videos of just having a genuine
[5180.36 --> 5185.48]  conversation i don't know if it's going to prove a point though because like yeah because it's yeah
[5185.48 --> 5192.28]  what does that tell us if we have literally one of the most consequential great point contributors
[5192.28 --> 5197.88]  to the tech world i love it could we do an hour and a half long interview with them okay yeah find me
[5197.88 --> 5205.08]  another one all right i'll go get bill gates no i told you i i know that's the thing right like yeah okay
[5205.08 --> 5213.16]  i told you gaben okay was and was i'll send him an email there's some other ones for sure we could
[5213.16 --> 5220.44]  do one show from his yacht why not right uh oh yeah apparently uh gaben took delivery of his new 500
[5220.44 --> 5226.36]  million dollar yacht today yep you guys see that yeah it has a live-in nurse i guess at his age that
[5226.36 --> 5231.40]  kind of makes sense and also it's not just for leisure it's for like scientific exploration too
[5231.40 --> 5238.12]  um it has a diving thing and a submarine to do marine life so having i mean steve erwin wouldn't
[5238.12 --> 5245.48]  have minded if uh he'd been working off of a yacht that had on board medical staff but it's not a joke
[5245.48 --> 5251.88]  yep why is everything a joke with your generation that one's rough well that one's rough please don't
[5253.48 --> 5259.80]  well i don't know if i don't know if that one will ever not be too soon steve erwin oh he was taken too
[5259.80 --> 5264.04]  soon that's the thing that's the thing it's not that whether the joke is too soon or not too soon
[5264.04 --> 5270.28]  it said he was taken too soon so it's always too soon forever but i'm sure he wouldn't have minded
[5271.48 --> 5276.60]  if there was a medical professional closer um so i can see why gaben would have done that it
[5276.60 --> 5283.32]  apparently has 15 gaming pcs which is a weird number was a little odd i noticed that too 15 that's got to
[5283.32 --> 5289.08]  be a typo there's no way it's not eight or 16 three teams of five one at the head of the table
[5289.08 --> 5292.76]  so what we're playing knights vikings pirates like what are we even talking about here what are you
[5292.76 --> 5298.60]  even talking about i don't even think that supports teams of five yeah i got nothing yeah give me a
[5298.60 --> 5303.48]  five v five v five people are speculating 14 crew members that would be kind of interesting could you
[5303.48 --> 5309.24]  imagine just gabe playing with his 14 he's like all right guys you're off shift we're all gonna boot
[5309.24 --> 5313.24]  up some honestly if you live there completely i wouldn't be too surprised it's pretty cool yeah
[5313.24 --> 5317.32]  he's talked about how he plays like uh like dota and just gets like trolled by people and stuff
[5317.32 --> 5326.12]  people tell him to uninstall the game and stuff that's crazy amazing um but uh my starlink latency was
[5326.12 --> 5331.80]  too bad going back to the linus torvalds thing yeah make sure that people know that we had a reddit
[5331.80 --> 5339.08]  thread where we asked you guys for your questions we did go through about 10 to 15 ish of them again
[5339.08 --> 5343.64]  don't know if all of them will make it but some were really interesting some were not but yeah
[5343.64 --> 5347.16]  some after like you should just go read his autobiography and then you'll know the answer
[5347.16 --> 5353.08]  to a lot of the questions you guys asked i'm really glad i read it um we changed the questions about an
[5353.08 --> 5358.04]  hour before he showed up because it was like oh yeah this would have been really stupid to ask even
[5358.04 --> 5363.16]  though it's it's weird because people might not have read the autobiography so for them it's really
[5363.16 --> 5368.84]  interesting to just have this question but it's also really obvious but i wanted you know our
[5368.84 --> 5374.60]  contribution to the to totally that was the right way to go yeah i wanted us to be bringing
[5374.60 --> 5379.16]  something new to the table so even if you're a diehard linus torvalds fan you watch every interview
[5379.16 --> 5383.80]  you can find of him i want you to find something new in ours and it's not just he's not just a man
[5383.80 --> 5388.92]  to be milked for content like it's you want it to be decently more interesting for him as well so if
[5388.92 --> 5395.16]  he's just rehashing things that he wrote down in his autobiography it's like i don't know i wanted him to
[5395.16 --> 5402.20]  i wanted him to enjoy the experience exactly and he said it was fine which means we might
[5403.48 --> 5412.52]  get him back up here yeah dude the fact that he came to us still blows my mind it was so funny that
[5412.52 --> 5416.68]  conversation because he's like well it makes so much more sense it'd be more effort for me to clean
[5416.68 --> 5421.40]  up my place to get and get you guys down here and it'd be so much work for you guys to bring all your
[5421.40 --> 5428.36]  equipment i want and i'm just like dude your time is not considerate your time and my time are not of
[5428.36 --> 5439.80]  equal worth like if it takes you an hour then i should be spending hours before we draw a parallel and
[5439.80 --> 5447.80]  decide what makes sense you know like i think with his do everything once thing though yeah like it was
[5447.80 --> 5453.96]  probably cool to see the operation yeah i guess i just maybe next time you'll have to go to him
[5453.96 --> 5458.92]  me standing in a room with him i have a hard time thinking there's anything cool for him to experience
[5459.88 --> 5465.56]  you know yeah yeah but then i mean i yeah we're pretty cool it's just it's all relative yeah yeah yeah
[5465.56 --> 5473.72]  yeah you know and we're not a fighter jet no we are not a fighter we're not a fighter for sure
[5473.72 --> 5480.20]  gamer fighter jet stop let's go light sim in a flight the person in the back if they're not
[5480.20 --> 5483.08]  actively shooting missiles could play like stardew valley
[5485.64 --> 5491.32]  wow the opposite ends of the spectrum of what you're doing dog fight to stardew valley play this is
[5491.32 --> 5495.64]  going to be a bit of a niche reference but play spec ops the line in the back of a fighter jet would
[5495.64 --> 5501.00]  be no one's going to get that but the like four people that get it it'll it'll it'll smash with
[5502.44 --> 5513.40]  amazing um yeah i i i think that is um a few people got it nice there's definitely been points in my
[5513.40 --> 5520.84]  career that were more consequential like ego wise like the first time we did a million views in less than
[5520.84 --> 5525.96]  24 hours on a video like i'll remember that forever it was seven gamers one cpu yeah and
[5525.96 --> 5532.60]  i'll remember like staring at at this view graph going this is unbelievable this is the closest thing
[5532.60 --> 5537.08]  to a viral video we've ever done it's always been slow and steady this is it this is breakthrough moment
[5537.08 --> 5544.04]  like i'll remember stuff like that i'll remember you know pacing pacing the family room of the uh the
[5544.04 --> 5549.16]  old house uh talking to steve on the phone and finding out we're gonna get the channel you know like
[5549.16 --> 5556.04]  there's there's moments like that in my career that are are like core core memories but in terms of
[5556.04 --> 5564.60]  like importance of a video we've made i or like i don't know if it's that important it's like highlight
[5564.60 --> 5571.32]  yeah like highlight reel career highlight reel this is like it's very high i don't i'm afraid to call it
[5571.32 --> 5575.32]  number one because maybe there's but then if something's that if something's number one i shouldn't
[5575.32 --> 5580.04]  forget it yeah and it's possible that something could take it i think that's okay to look at it
[5580.04 --> 5585.80]  from that perspective and i'm and i'm talking career like obviously there's there's personal
[5585.80 --> 5589.80]  life highlights that are bigger than meeting linus torvalds like my wife my wife ranks above
[5589.80 --> 5594.84]  linus torvalds you don't have kids debatable oh yeah not debatable what are you talking about
[5594.84 --> 5602.68]  not debatable you know birth of my children wedding day these are those are maybe close second and
[5602.68 --> 5607.72]  third you know yeah i know i told my wife i was like sorry honey
[5610.76 --> 5614.76]  you're moving down to seven and then she was like yeah you can sleep on the couch and i was like
[5614.76 --> 5620.92]  understand yeah fair enough sorry but i just drove line in stormy's home so i'm taking my
[5620.92 --> 5629.56]  little body pillow to the couch cool um yeah anything else you oh right there's something that we wanted
[5629.56 --> 5635.88]  to present to luke so he couldn't be here um unfortunately oh yeah you were gonna elaborate
[5635.88 --> 5642.12]  on this yeah why was that elijah planner of this video sorry what knower of things i might be interested in
[5642.12 --> 5648.92]  what why um i think there's i texted you uh-huh the friday before the shoot i think or the thursday
[5648.92 --> 5653.72]  before the shoot right that was when he told me the date of the shoot so i had just the weekend to
[5653.72 --> 5657.24]  because i'd been putting it off to read the autobiography which i got signed by the way
[5658.04 --> 5663.48]  and the shoot was on wednesday um i told you i said hey i've done script review that means this is like
[5663.48 --> 5669.40]  100 locked in now even though it was already potentially locked in before i said hey it's gonna be
[5669.40 --> 5675.48]  on wednesday just so you know you just responded with a sad face and then a very uh angry word
[5675.48 --> 5679.88]  that i won't repeat because i don't have a bleep button um i here we can try and time it all right
[5679.88 --> 5688.12]  three two i don't know if we that was late for sure that was for sure uh and then you just said i won't be
[5688.12 --> 5697.72]  there and then another sad face um and i was like oh i'm sorry buddy today we were talking yeah and i was
[5697.72 --> 5703.08]  like well technically his flight and everything was booked like three or four weeks ago which if
[5703.08 --> 5708.68]  the flight is booked you could be pretty sure about when the shoot would be to be fair we weren't
[5709.24 --> 5716.04]  because of current at the time how some airports were struggling with delays right yeah it was a
[5716.04 --> 5723.48]  case of we don't actually know um but you know i probably could have tried to give you a heads up
[5723.48 --> 5728.92]  mm-hmm because right about that time is when i locked in the flights for the other thing
[5729.48 --> 5734.92]  so if i knew i could have no if you were already locking it in then no i could have just not though
[5734.92 --> 5741.24]  at that time if i knew there was a extremely major conflict sorry i don't know blame vance he actually
[5741.24 --> 5747.80]  booked the flights oh wow you did not just throw vance under the bus well that's his job
[5747.80 --> 5754.76]  i can't believe the assistant i'm sorry vance not only did he do it we double down
[5755.32 --> 5762.04]  vance you are very important that's crazy assisting ruining your birthday that's crazy
[5764.60 --> 5769.16]  he's just not gonna book any of my meetings with you now and i'm just i mean that could happen he has
[5769.16 --> 5775.32]  that power yeah i'm just gonna walk into your office he can throw you out he has that power too
[5775.88 --> 5780.76]  good luck trying i'm pretty heavy i'm sorry no comment
[5783.48 --> 5789.80]  thanks man i have vance would call you don't you you can't you can't say this let the record show
[5789.80 --> 5797.48]  let the record show that i have never explicitly commented so instead it's on video instead of
[5797.48 --> 5806.52]  it's on video you commenting on my size all wrong wrong platform height it was the height that i was
[5806.52 --> 5813.48]  concerned about no i buy that for five dollars you looked at a go-kart and you said hey do you fit
[5813.48 --> 5822.20]  right because because it was made by a chinese company that while they did design it for adults they
[5822.20 --> 5827.96]  designed it is this the one i've sat in they designed it for adults of a shorter a shorter
[5829.08 --> 5836.04]  my bones do not fit inside of it altitudinal stature you have also said on video dang i know you're not
[5836.04 --> 5844.60]  playing any connect games because you are quite young implying because it wasn't hooked up no
[5844.60 --> 5853.48]  oh man because the wii u just says oof because you're quite young you might not have as much
[5853.48 --> 5858.60]  nostalgia for it i also want you to know i've cut some jokes from videos because i know if they ever
[5858.60 --> 5867.00]  hit the platform it would be over oh man anyways we got your float plane sign signed yeah so consolation
[5867.00 --> 5874.36]  prize um luke asked us to get his float plane sign signed is that plugged in no oh well we should plug it
[5874.36 --> 5879.56]  in i mean it has a it's proprietary i'm assuming they left it at my desk oh yeah okay that makes sense
[5879.56 --> 5884.76]  so luke has a little light up float plane sign and it is now officially signed by the same person
[5884.76 --> 5889.64]  it's it's exactly the same as the signs that they have at nasa mission control it's made by the same
[5889.64 --> 5895.56]  person with the same materials that's a very cool artifact and it is now signed by not only
[5896.76 --> 5906.36]  linus torvalds but also for some reason for some reason that's okay we can wash it off we can we can
[5906.36 --> 5912.04]  remove that i think he's always just been too shy to ask so i have been waiting for 15 years do you
[5912.04 --> 5920.12]  not sign his checks no no there has been no way for me to get a signature until now so when so so
[5920.12 --> 5927.64]  when linus signed it i was like you know what i'll sign it too it was that it was so awkward and weird
[5927.64 --> 5933.32]  of course it was to be fair when i saw you doing this i was like should i stop him because i was like
[5933.32 --> 5938.92]  and then didn't so it didn't let me know on time so i could make travel arrangements to actually be
[5938.92 --> 5945.32]  here and then doesn't stop the wrong linus from signing the sign i didn't want to make a scene
[5945.32 --> 5951.56]  i was like we can remove it like paint over it you're that guy with the charlie problem that just
[5951.56 --> 5956.04]  like doesn't pull the lever to make the obviously better thing happen no i make sure i split the rail
[5956.04 --> 5964.52]  multi-track drifting this is going to kill one person or seven million so instead of instead of
[5964.52 --> 5970.52]  being here for the coolest shoot we've ever done uh to meet to meet linus torvalds you have my
[5970.52 --> 5977.00]  autograph i have i have linus's autograph on my thing i was getting trolled by nick harris from the lab the
[5977.00 --> 5983.24]  entire time he told the qualcomm people it was my birthday and at dinner they sang happy birthday to me
[5983.24 --> 5992.04]  which made me just want to die you want to know something crazy i have made it i have made it 39
[5992.04 --> 5999.96]  years of my life never being sung to in a restaurant that was a stupid thing to say we gotta change that
[5999.96 --> 6006.44]  i will walk out we'll follow you i will i will definitely hold him in place oh yeah both of us
[6006.44 --> 6011.64]  no yeah easily no especially how he comments on my son i think you're gonna remember this anyway
[6011.64 --> 6020.36]  uh uh dude there's like oh there's only 10 000 we're not you we remember if you see him in public
[6020.36 --> 6027.96]  on his birthday i have to get you back for the sign no yeah that's funny no yeah sign his car
[6027.96 --> 6035.48]  it should be very funny sorry nick harris is trolling you okay yeah so it very long work day nick harris is
[6035.48 --> 6040.52]  trolling me the whole time as per usual but he just he keeps like threatening that he's gonna tell them but
[6040.52 --> 6048.20]  it's obviously like uh he wouldn't do that and then he actually did it so so at the end of the night
[6048.20 --> 6053.32]  two qualcomm people very nice people come up and walk up just to my side and are just like staring
[6053.32 --> 6060.12]  at me for a second and i'm thoroughly confused i'm like like can i help you we're out at dinner uh and
[6060.12 --> 6065.80]  then i hear the like and i look to my right and there's sparklers and it's just
[6068.04 --> 6073.88]  the worst i'm not okay so that was also like oh no day started at eight in the morning we're going
[6073.88 --> 6081.00]  actually no my day started no day started about eight in the morning yeah um working working working
[6081.00 --> 6087.00]  we get on to the bus while we're moving i'm taking a call we go do stuff while we're on the bus again i'm
[6087.00 --> 6092.52]  taking another call for most of the dinner i have an airpod in because i'm in a call the whole time
[6092.52 --> 6097.08]  like this is a very heavy work day and then right when i get off the call it's happy birthday singing
[6099.32 --> 6103.64]  the whole time i'm getting messaged about how cool the linus torvald shoot that i can't be at is
[6105.32 --> 6110.44]  get back to hotel crash because i'm super tired get a call at like four in the morning that the forum is
[6110.44 --> 6118.52]  down so i can't even sleep it was like worst birthday ever potentially which you know all things
[6118.52 --> 6123.72]  considered not that it could have been yeah it could have been worse could have been worse yeah that is
[6123.72 --> 6128.44]  probably my worst birthday yeah you could have we could have had both linus torvalds and gay ben here
[6128.44 --> 6133.24]  at the studio at the same time you could have missed that that would have been worse i'm gonna plan the
[6133.24 --> 6144.44]  game and shoot when you're gone i will freak out no do it do it with just luke yeah with linus gone
[6144.44 --> 6152.20]  yeah i think i would lose my job he actually has that power worth it his body language since dan said
[6152.20 --> 6159.48]  that is amazing so when i was in a clip please i don't want i should the like aura coming off of linus
[6159.48 --> 6167.56]  was so strong i would lose my job not acceptable not acceptable that was amazing we flew to
[6167.56 --> 6173.48]  gabe's yacht for a flow plane exclusive sammy elijah luke

[6183.16 --> 6188.28]  all right didn't luke miss the last guess yeah i missed all of them as far as i can tell linus
[6188.28 --> 6194.84]  purposely plans them i had nothing to do with the dates apparently it's vance i found out yeah how did

[6214.04 --> 6219.96]  believe it what do you mean not often i i don't think i pull rank that much just trying to start
[6219.96 --> 6228.12]  i would over this though oh yeah a hundred percent i'd be like no unacceptable it'd be really funny though
[6228.12 --> 6234.36]  oh no i'm debating if it's worth losing the job but you gotta be kidding me right now i'm gonna try
[6234.36 --> 6241.80]  to send it to to dan but nick got the frame that i turned from the people singing to him
[6242.84 --> 6250.84]  he has the frame of the video the look of betrayal top 10 anime betrayals right because it's it's a
[6250.84 --> 6257.08]  weird moment because i don't want to like obviously i don't want this to happen but i also don't want
[6257.08 --> 6263.16]  to like be a jerk to these people that i just met yeah there i sent it to you dan uh do you want
[6263.16 --> 6270.76]  that on screen sure yeah um so like so i'm trying to like sorry spoilers yeah are you ready yeah sure
[6270.76 --> 6279.00]  boop so i'm trying to like smile and be happy because i don't want to be a big jerk but then i'm also like
[6279.00 --> 6299.88]  what the hell nick oh no oh no that's way too funny i'm kind of crying a little bit oh man oh no
[6300.60 --> 6303.56]  so i just got trolled by like the whole world
[6305.56 --> 6314.52]  i'm sorry i really did wish you could be there i i i i really wanted to bail but like it's it's the
[6314.52 --> 6318.76]  friday or thursday or whatever before this thing that's been planned for like a month it's our first
[6318.76 --> 6326.20]  like thing of this style with them and yada yada yada so it's like luke's schmoozing and and and
[6326.20 --> 6331.72]  and for for our labs team to get us you know connected with all the right technical people
[6331.72 --> 6336.20]  to make sure that we can invest it and it was a great trip stuff and oh yeah no for sure it was
[6336.20 --> 6344.52]  actually legitimately a great trip so so saying would i have rather been here to hang out with like uh you
[6344.52 --> 6350.76]  know yeah 20 minute drive with him was pretty great trip all righty yeah even i'm a little jealous
[6350.76 --> 6356.84]  that might have been that was that's very cool to me that is like actually what top one or two
[6356.84 --> 6362.36]  moments in my life yeah obviously i was joking that's extremely cool yeah yeah like that's like
[6362.36 --> 6369.48]  i didn't even i love i didn't even have one on one time with them like we went for coffee i had a
[6369.48 --> 6375.00]  cookie there's also something about car drives i don't know what it is we talked about like youtube
[6375.00 --> 6379.96]  and like how the creator economy works a little bit he talked about like working with his team and what
[6379.96 --> 6385.88]  that's like yeah working from home probably fast mode um he honestly asked like more questions than i
[6385.88 --> 6391.40]  got to ask back which i felt was like no this man's asking me about youtube i was like again i think
[6391.40 --> 6395.96]  this is part of the try everything once thing and that's very cool to be the potential facilitator
[6395.96 --> 6400.84]  of that that's still extremely cool because one thing we talked about was the recent ad block
[6400.84 --> 6406.60]  change that ended up impacting views and how that can impact uh the creator economy from a sponsorship
[6406.60 --> 6412.84]  side or how that could impact just channel momentum and he was it seemed very interested in like
[6412.84 --> 6418.60]  oh that's a change that i could see how ad blockers are just like too but like it really impacted
[6418.60 --> 6422.92]  it's a huge deal well and i think to a certain degree it's still happening and that's a whole other
[6422.92 --> 6431.40]  thing yeah very cool all righty i don't want to overstate my welcome thank you for letting me hang
[6431.40 --> 6439.32]  out so thanks for nothing yeah i do my best all right see you bye everyone have a good weekend i do my

[6444.84 --> 6450.20]  i think it's yeah you're still it was still it was resentful i could tell i could tell
[6450.92 --> 6457.40]  there's not a lot of room back here oh for sure by the way that ltx 19 shirt though yeah damn it's uh
[6457.40 --> 6460.84]  been a little worse for wear but for some reason it's one of my favorite shirts all right all right

[6955.80 --> 6962.68]  a long time yeah i know so there's some pent-up demand anyway uh since we're live
[6964.12 --> 6971.80]  i didn't mean to do that it was it was unintentionally quite good nice quality quality linus
[6974.36 --> 6978.60]  what was i going to say oh yeah right and since we're live now is a great time to place your order
[6978.60 --> 6983.48]  on ltt store because you can send a merge message all you got to do is add something to your cart and then
[6983.48 --> 6988.76]  yep whenever we're live there will be a box where you can send a merch message this makes much more
[6988.76 --> 6995.48]  sense than streaks is that what it's called that's i don't know hype train hype train they did a hype
[6995.48 --> 7002.04]  train in twitch chat because stop it they did that because we acknowledged them for the first time in
[7002.04 --> 7006.60]  years and i told them that's dumb and what you should do if you want to throw money at your screen
[7007.16 --> 7012.20]  i mean by all means use your prime you know membership or subscription or whatever they're called on
[7012.20 --> 7017.72]  twitch use that one i don't care but don't spend money on that spend money on ltdstore.com where
[7018.44 --> 7025.48]  whether we acknowledge your message by you know having dan reply to it there he is or he forwards
[7025.48 --> 7030.60]  it to someone who can get you a better answer or he throws it up on the screen like that one that's a bit
[7030.60 --> 7034.92]  up there or he curates it for me and luke to answer you will still get high quality merchandise in
[7034.92 --> 7039.88]  the mail you can type a message you can be anonymous or have your name show you can change the color of
[7039.88 --> 7046.44]  your merch message you will have to opt in to email communication about your message if you have
[7046.44 --> 7050.68]  a question that dan can't answer so that is sort of worth knowing and then you go ahead and place
[7050.68 --> 7054.20]  your order all right dan do you want to show us how merch messages works hit us with a couple yeah
[7054.20 --> 7060.36]  sure we got lots today things are selling quite quickly yep it's that season it is that time of year
[7060.36 --> 7066.04]  hello lld i finished my engineering degree next year i'll do my master's degree and i've been working
[7066.04 --> 7074.12]  for a month on my thesis about outside in tracking with rf what features are relevant here
[7076.44 --> 7086.76]  what features are relevant here this feels truncated uh potentially maybe uh
[7086.76 --> 7093.16]  uh i know that the the the new one uses cameras where some of the other ones use
[7093.80 --> 7101.16]  other forms like the oculus uses a different type and you mean outside in with the original oculus
[7101.16 --> 7107.88]  i guess cv1 was camera yes that was cameras and then lighthouses are laser if i remember correctly yes
[7107.88 --> 7121.96]  um man but then technically light is rf technically isn't it so like uh strange yeah i'm sorry i i think
[7121.96 --> 7128.12]  this is truncated and i don't know if we're going to be able to answer that in any meaningful way
[7128.12 --> 7132.28]  darn up next
[7136.92 --> 7144.60]  okay yes let's do that sorry um favorite taylor swift okay you're not going to give them anything
[7144.60 --> 7148.44]  good oh do you just want to get through this quickly so we can do more topics and you can go
[7148.44 --> 7154.20]  home eventually is that what this is about what do you mean i thought we were moving on from that

[7160.04 --> 7165.40]  it's the most important week of lmg basically in you know years at this point because we have

[7171.32 --> 7176.84]  like i mean that's why they hid their name it is anonymous because they don't know how to answer good

[7285.96 --> 7291.24]  oh so it's like well time to do the other thing okay fair enough yeah all right i was trying to
[7291.24 --> 7296.76]  think it was it was very frustrating for a while and then i was just like you know i'll just cut
[7296.76 --> 7302.12]  then yeah make lemonade yeah exactly it's fine on say style it's fine i'll make it work yeah and i'll
[7302.12 --> 7308.04]  just lemonade get back to it when things are better yeah that was more like was that a p diddy thing

[7321.32 --> 7325.40]  i feel like giving someone else a ding just gave him a significant amount of dopamine
[7326.44 --> 7331.72]  does he need his own bell i was concerned for my uh my dry sweater for a second there
[7331.72 --> 7342.28]  oh no oh gross gross how about another one moving on okay let's do one more hi dll how do you deal
[7342.28 --> 7349.56]  with issues of sibling rivalry both in your kids for linus and with your siblings growing up also more
[7349.56 --> 7355.48]  underwear stock win are we out of stock did we sell them all we sell them stop it so quickly did we
[7355.48 --> 7362.52]  really all people love them that sucks i wanted some of those i gotta start just i'm gonna start
[7362.52 --> 7368.76]  submitting my dog the larges are out of stock for you would you prefer that no no i just i feel like
[7368.76 --> 7374.76]  we should use the like is luke gonna buy it metric because every time i want to buy something on the
[7374.76 --> 7380.20]  store it's just gone i think i think i'm going to accost you after the show and we will sit down
[7380.20 --> 7385.40]  and just put stuff in there for you maybe uh damn it
[7388.36 --> 7397.80]  okay anyway um crap yeah medium large and xl are all gone uh oh which store are you on hold on i'm
[7397.80 --> 7404.12]  on the usa store there's still some more in stock on the usa store i'm on global yeah both designs for
[7404.68 --> 7409.24]  medium large and xl by the way it's not even just like one of them it's both designs yeah meanwhile
[7409.24 --> 7415.56]  on the us store it's uh medium large are out for the solid and it's just large out for the prism
[7416.12 --> 7425.40]  and confetti design small is also sold out on the solid okay well anyway um of all the problems to
[7425.40 --> 7434.28]  have yeah no no no no no yeah the worst problem i i i know well it's not a good problem no no it's not
[7434.28 --> 7442.28]  good but it's um it's it would be worse if no one wanted it's really hard to find the right balance
[7442.28 --> 7447.64]  when you're when you're stalking and now that we have multiple distribution centers it's even more
[7447.64 --> 7452.12]  challenging and it's only going to get more challenging in the future as like obviously
[7452.12 --> 7456.28]  you know it's not like it's not occurred to us that it would be good to have a european dc for instance
[7456.28 --> 7463.48]  i'm getting roasted by flow point chat um oh seth highland asks what percentage of ltt sales are
[7463.48 --> 7470.12]  doing wanshow less than you'd probably think a fair bit like wanshow is is a big driver we often
[7470.12 --> 7475.16]  launch products on wanshow so that inflates the numbers a little bit uh but when we don't it's not
[7475.16 --> 7479.56]  like we don't have other mechanisms for promoting uh for promoting new products and stuff like that and
[7479.56 --> 7486.92]  they'll still they'll still be quite strong um no it's it's a very serious business for us i mean i i
[7486.92 --> 7491.64]  think i meant did i mention earlier on the show today that um you got to meet linus torvalds without
[7491.64 --> 7497.56]  me that we're finally doing how does lmg spend money oh i don't know if you did or not did i talk about
[7497.56 --> 7502.60]  it last week do you guys know about this already okay yeah so basically i've had more exposure to
[7503.40 --> 7509.08]  you know expense reports in the last week than i probably have in the last five years because i just
[7509.08 --> 7515.40]  don't really look that closely at that stuff as part of my my daily work sure and um the merch
[7515.40 --> 7522.20]  business is huge like we on inventory we spend millions and millions and millions of dollars a year
[7522.20 --> 7535.40]  it's crazy um and it's so hard to get it right to not over buy but not under buy especially when i mean
[7535.40 --> 7545.64]  you go on the store and like almost every product is a bespoke created product yeah we really have no
[7545.64 --> 7552.36]  idea i was talking to someone about this recently we really have no idea how to chill with things
[7552.92 --> 7560.60]  like why would we chill like like ever even when it would be totally fine we're like nah yeah nah why would
[7560.60 --> 7569.24]  we chill let's make a pen but instead but instead of it being a normal pen okay this one is relatively
[7569.24 --> 7576.04]  low effort by the way that was very cool uh we can't really talk about oh yeah no we can't at all
[7576.04 --> 7585.00]  or who we were talking to nope but luke and i got on very like strong authority
[7585.00 --> 7594.60]  that ptm 7950 is goaded yes like extremely strong pretty much like i can't tell you who it is but the
[7594.60 --> 7602.04]  highest pretty maximum strong authority there's god and then there's this individual in terms of their
[7602.04 --> 7609.00]  authority on this subject it was pretty it was pretty validating i don't know if i disagree yeah yeah
[7609.00 --> 7613.64]  yep so that was that was pretty cool um
[7616.52 --> 7621.72]  oh oh oh my god full plane chat won't leave me alone dude what what is this
[7621.72 --> 7625.64]  oh charged nuclei said and you let luke meet them
[7629.16 --> 7631.80]  just every time every time you bring up anything
[7631.80 --> 7639.64]  it wasn't my fault luke i didn't know no i know it was it was the person who recently left i know
[7639.64 --> 7643.88]  i really i i would have fought for you if there was anything that could have been done you know i
[7643.88 --> 7647.40]  would have paid for you to get a flight back i knew it was upcoming but legitimately until that i
[7647.40 --> 7651.88]  think thursday i had no idea it was like the next week i know i'm sorry that it was way too late
[7651.88 --> 7659.56]  i mean it is what it is but at least you have that sign that is actually really cool from both of us
[7661.80 --> 7670.20]  because that sign is like one of my favorite things and then yeah i'm surprised you don't like the one for the wall more
[7670.20 --> 7673.80]  no that's super cool oh i thought you like gave it back to me or something didn't you
[7674.92 --> 7680.20]  i think no you asked me to store it yeah because you didn't have anywhere to put it yes yeah okay never mind and i still
[7680.60 --> 7687.08]  don't and i still have the plane too i'm still like holding on to that for you that's yours that's not mine i don't like want it forever
[7687.08 --> 7693.64]  luke do you ever in a cool way though do you ever display the one of one thing that you have that i gave you
[7694.76 --> 7700.76]  from the place with the people that's secret good okay yeah yeah very you've seen it
[7702.20 --> 7708.52]  uh it it unravels like that oh that yeah yeah yeah you should never show anyone that
[7708.52 --> 7715.96]  that is that is private yeah very private um all right uh what are what are we supposed to what was
[7715.96 --> 7722.52]  the word very behind um right sibling rivalry sibling rivalry yeah how do i put this uh how do i put
[7722.52 --> 7729.48]  this lightly i i i don't really feel any rivalry with my siblings we've um you gotta not put the how do
[7729.48 --> 7734.12]  i put this lightly first well no i don't put the how do i put this lightly first then that statement is
[7734.12 --> 7738.20]  totally fine i think people could take it the wrong way though i think by putting how do i put this
[7738.20 --> 7742.92]  lightly before it people will now take it the wrong way oh no if you just didn't say that it would have
[7742.92 --> 7748.44]  been no no offense but i actually have a pretty healthy relationship with my family yeah no my
[7748.44 --> 7754.68]  point is that we have none of us have tried to achieve even remotely the same things like my siblings
[7754.68 --> 7763.24]  have zero interest in being an online influencer across the board zero so like how do you how do you
[7763.24 --> 7773.08]  measure that kind of yeah like there's no rivalry there yeah um and like it's also yeah like wildly
[7773.08 --> 7782.28]  different types of success um yeah and i mean it's like if i'm looking at my like sibling rivalry i think
[7782.28 --> 7790.60]  my brother has achieved very immense levels of success in very different things he got the exact career that
[7790.60 --> 7795.40]  he wanted yep in the exact way that he wanted it and is excelling with it seems to be nailing it on
[7795.40 --> 7799.96]  the family side nailing on the family side pun intended he's got a couple kids he's got yeah yeah
[7800.60 --> 7806.36]  and that's all going pretty well sorry rich little graphic but you won't mind i know
[7807.48 --> 7813.96]  uh so like i yeah i i don't see any i hear what you're saying it's completely different realms yeah yeah
[7813.96 --> 7820.84]  yeah luke informed me you're good at it in ways that make sense to him and to you but not to the
[7820.84 --> 7829.32]  audience right now so no further elaborate extremely weirdly i almost feel like i need to explain that
[7829.32 --> 7834.68]  now i'm uncomfortable i don't think you can i don't think you should we've got linus's thighs and now this
[7834.68 --> 7843.32]  what's going on i don't think you can the success rate was high it's like the chicken no it's not like the
[7843.32 --> 7847.32]  our family's just it's not like the chicken it's nothing like chicken
[7851.32 --> 7853.40]  chicken is chicken in not
[7856.28 --> 7860.36]  chicken pregnant i mean you could check on i think that's allowed
[7860.36 --> 7865.16]  the chicken is
[7865.72 --> 7867.32]  and we're cooked
[7870.12 --> 7873.32]  why did why did linus torvald ever agree
[7875.48 --> 7881.24]  because he never heard of our channel never seen the wans show there's no way there's no way he's ever
[7881.24 --> 7886.36]  seen the wans show i actually specifically asked him if he looked into any like controversies around us and
[7886.36 --> 7894.20]  he said he explicitly doesn't oh which used to be my policy i'm happy that hasn't bit him in the butt
[7894.20 --> 7902.84]  and then i collabed with hassan and collabed with um too mad and i was on a bit of a streak there for
[7902.84 --> 7910.28]  a bit yeah yeah i do really hate where like if if there's if there's literally any level of like
[7910.28 --> 7914.92]  contact people assume that you've like done deep dives on everyone around like that's insane and
[7914.92 --> 7920.44]  needs to stop but or that you agree with them on everything yeah now literally every single thing
[7920.44 --> 7925.16]  they've ever said you now full-heartedly agree with yep like there's people i know and i'm friends with
[7925.16 --> 7930.20]  where i can name a multitude of things that i don't agree with them on like that i feel like
[7930.20 --> 7936.52]  that should be fairly normal but anyways that's a whole other topic let's oh yeah xvc there you go nice
[7936.52 --> 7945.64]  and to be clear i'm not saying that i like hate those people or whatever i'm just saying that have
[7945.64 --> 7951.08]  been controversial figures i didn't research them at all and i didn't realize that they were quite
[7951.08 --> 7957.08]  polarizing yeah that's all i'll say yeah because that's all that needs to be said i think we came
[7957.08 --> 7963.56]  out of those fairly unscathed yeah i think so i think so yeah i think the one that there was the
[7963.56 --> 7969.24]  most concern about was too mad yes and i was just like yeah what he bombed some zoom calls at that
[7969.24 --> 7975.64]  point i think he got more controversial later i think that's true we also kind of i think i think
[7975.64 --> 7983.08]  i think all of those figures i think every single every single collab in that collab streak has become
[7983.08 --> 7988.12]  more controversial over time i think that's true but i think they were people who that was
[7988.12 --> 7997.00]  to a certain degree their shtick so it was somewhat inevitable i think yeah i'm actually
[7998.12 --> 8001.96]  x i can't tell oh my god aj
[8005.32 --> 8013.72]  come on did you make it admin only don't don't add more admin only emotes did he seriously add the you
[8013.72 --> 8020.84]  being upset about the birthday song i absolutely did not send it to him on teams so that he could
[8020.84 --> 8027.56]  do that oh my god this is amazing uh oh you probably oh you probably need that new command
[8029.64 --> 8036.20]  what's the you're gonna need a new command um what is the what is the command for clear cash
[8036.20 --> 8049.08]  uh with a capital c how do i type how do i type this oh yeah the spam has begun cash cleared no no no
[8049.08 --> 8054.76]  no no the first c is lowercase the second key is c is capital oh everybody's doing it wrong my bad
[8054.76 --> 8059.08]  i said it i said it poorly the for it's it's clear all lowercase and then capital c
[8059.08 --> 8070.52]  cash yeah all right c-a-s-h um as for sibling rivalry with my kids do this i think we why would
[8070.52 --> 8075.96]  you do this people are actually doing it why would you do that that's great that's that's how i get all
[8075.96 --> 8082.28]  their money from ltt store they type clear cash it all comes to me they clear their cash it re-ups
[8082.28 --> 8088.52]  their subscription yeah every single time um yeah this is the real hype train as for as for kids uh
[8088.52 --> 8095.40]  same thing my kids don't aspire to the same things like they're they're very very different i'd say
[8095.40 --> 8100.76]  that with the daughters it's it's something that we're going to be paying more and more close attention
[8100.76 --> 8106.20]  to as they like hit puberty and stuff and they start to you know think about body image and stuff
[8106.20 --> 8111.56]  like that but so far it hasn't really been a major issue like it's not like it's not like my
[8111.56 --> 8119.56]  daughter's care that my son's team went 36 and 0 for volleyball this year based the uh the gym coach
[8119.56 --> 8130.52]  who's been there long enough to um long enough that oh how do i say this doesn't help you oh uh
[8130.52 --> 8135.24]  basically she's been there a very long time and she said to her knowledge no team at the school has
[8135.24 --> 8141.32]  ever had an undefeated season in any grade in any sport which was pretty cool
[8141.32 --> 8146.60]  so they they went completely undefeated this year that's epic um just swept everything they
[8146.60 --> 8151.32]  unfortunately there were no provincials for his grade volleyball this year oh but there will be
[8151.32 --> 8156.04]  at higher grades but there will be at higher grades so he's um so he's he's getting pretty he's getting
[8156.04 --> 8161.96]  pretty into it i told him don't forget about badminton don't forget to play with me sometimes
[8161.96 --> 8171.64]  people are typing slash louv yeah that'll just unlock everything that makes sense and i don't
[8171.64 --> 8178.04]  know when more underwear stock is coming i'm sorry okay we should move on to a new topic microsoft exec says
[8178.04 --> 8187.72]  windows is evolving into an agentic os and gets cooked in the replies good although in fairness
[8187.72 --> 8194.68]  windows 11 start menu does seem like it's getting a pretty good redesign how's that in fairness i
[8194.68 --> 8200.68]  mean they're doing something something positive i think it's but also sure microsoft's current head of
[8200.68 --> 8206.84]  windows pavan daviluri posted on x to say that the future of the platform is one that is evolving into an agentic os
[8206.84 --> 8214.60]  the tweet has seen pushback with various opinions pretty much all stating the same thing nobody wants
[8214.60 --> 8219.48]  to use windows primarily through an ai middleman the windows start menu is receiving its first
[8219.48 --> 8225.80]  significant makeover since 2021 and will be delivered to all users as part of the november 11th update i do
[8225.80 --> 8230.76]  like it more the menu is now scrollable uh here do you want to sure so you can move through your apps
[8230.76 --> 8235.88]  in one place and the interface is now larger with a responsive layout that adapts to the screen size
[8235.88 --> 8244.44]  automatically however you cannot resize it manually for comparison yeah the start settings page is
[8244.44 --> 8248.84]  being updated and will no longer feature the layout option if you disable all the recommended settings
[8248.84 --> 8253.48]  you'll also have the ability to hide the recommended section of the start menu which honestly is probably
[8253.48 --> 8258.84]  good i don't need recommendations for what it was that i was hoping to open right now because you have
[8258.84 --> 8266.84]  no way of knowing that um i'm gonna kill our discussion question here we're just gonna kind of move on
[8266.84 --> 8273.64]  because yeah that's all i think i really feel the need to say about that oh this one doesn't have a
[8273.64 --> 8284.84]  header so i can't collapse it downer um luke you want to pick one sure uh let's talk about ubisoft oh no
[8284.84 --> 8293.00]  i just feel like you're doing a throwback to the old house keep on keep on digging keep on digging yeah we
[8293.00 --> 8299.40]  had this thing on wan show it's been a very long time where there was just it felt like every week yeah
[8299.40 --> 8305.32]  six months like i don't know how long it was a long time it was a long time just every every week
[8305.32 --> 8311.40]  every other week at least there was some terrible news out of ubisoft or they were doing something
[8311.40 --> 8317.08]  awful which was insane because that was also at like a pretty fairly peak time for ubisoft that was
[8317.08 --> 8322.12]  like assassin's creed 4 and like like all these like really big like their games are doing well
[8322.12 --> 8327.32]  but they were just doing really horrible things yeah or like the launch would be super buggy and
[8327.32 --> 8333.00]  they'd fix it later but it was just like unnecessary floating eyeballs and stuff yeah that was like
[8333.00 --> 8337.00]  slightly later than what i was talking about but definitely still during keep on digging yeah so we
[8337.00 --> 8341.56]  we even made a shirt it had a shovel on it nick van burkle designed it that was back when just like
[8342.28 --> 8346.84]  we didn't have designers we just had our video editors who had some familiarity with like talented
[8346.84 --> 8352.44]  people yeah the adobe suite so anyway yeah all right what's up with ubisoft right now ubisoft delayed
[8352.44 --> 8358.60]  its half year earnings report which is a really big deal for public companies and requested halted trading
[8358.60 --> 8365.56]  until its release on thursday november okay we're moving stuff around on thursday november 13th the day
[8365.56 --> 8373.80]  ubisoft was to release its half year yeah the day of crazy uh was to release its half year 2025 2026 earnings report
[8373.80 --> 8380.04]  the company instead announced a delay and requested a halt to the trading of its shares and bonds
[8380.68 --> 8389.40]  on euro next all right uh and gash it says delays to earning reports may happen due to accounting issues
[8389.40 --> 8398.04]  but speculates halting trading of the company's shares could portend major news such as a sale or ubisoft
[8398.04 --> 8406.60]  becoming a private entity again oh interesting uh tencent recently took a 25 stake of new ubisoft subsidiary
[8406.60 --> 8412.20]  vantage studios which now manages the company's major titles like assassin's creed far cry and rainbow
[8412.20 --> 8420.76]  why would they do that that's weird because they want to own gaming no why would why would ubisoft split
[8420.76 --> 8431.88]  off their major titles into a sub brand because ubisoft is f***ed oh so sink the bad ship move everything
[8431.88 --> 8439.32]  else off and do a okay all right makes sense uh there was talk of tencent taking ubisoft private last year
[8439.32 --> 8446.36]  yikes uh this follows contract buyouts for some employees of the company just last month this is
[8446.36 --> 8453.80]  the kind of like financial finagling that means that no matter how poorly managed a company is once it's
[8453.80 --> 8457.88]  big enough it almost feels like there's no consequences for the leadership because they can just
[8458.84 --> 8468.12]  make moves and then yeah keep shoveling money into the sacks of money that they sleep on presumably like
[8468.12 --> 8474.68]  yeah the individual developers will suffer in all of this like sort of reorg acquisition nonsense but
[8474.68 --> 8478.76]  the actual the the leadership that put them in a position where they weren't profitable enough to
[8478.76 --> 8487.32]  just keep doing what they were doing in the first place if anything will probably benefit i uh i uh yeah i
[8488.60 --> 8493.16]  i saw a comment go by about this but i also had the thought and i and i lost the comment so i can't
[8493.16 --> 8502.28]  say the person's name so sorry but um video game industry canada yikes oh yeah ea is now purchased
[8502.28 --> 8510.44]  yep ubisoft is well let's see but clearly something funky something yeah yeah star eye says china ubisoft
[8510.44 --> 8519.16]  and saudi ea crazy times pretty much yikes uh we should probably do sponsor spots at some point
[8519.16 --> 8525.16]  here this is ooh or not carry on not you can go for it i was gonna have a conversation about like the
[8525.16 --> 8530.28]  industries that you can get into in canada and how that's like i had a conversation on a recent trip
[8530.28 --> 8535.24]  about um okay i didn't realize adreno
[8538.28 --> 8538.76]  radion
[8538.76 --> 8546.92]  oh
[8546.92 --> 8547.00]  oh
[8549.16 --> 8556.36]  oh yeah wasn't it imagion didn't they like acquire that ip or something from amd and hold on there was
[8556.36 --> 8563.88]  some speculation that they might have acquired some part of ati uh imagion previously ati imagion was a
[8563.88 --> 8570.60]  series of media co-processors hold on hold on produced by ati later amd amd later sold it to
[8570.60 --> 8576.12]  qualcomm in 2009 yeah yeah so that's where adreno comes from i actually didn't realize that that was
[8576.12 --> 8582.28]  where adreno came from had no i thought imagion was a cooler name uh personally imagion's pretty cool
[8582.84 --> 8590.04]  yeah but yeah anyways adreno comes from there uh but ati was canadian for people that don't know
[8590.04 --> 8598.36]  we also had um nortel blackberry a lot of our but yeah sure yeah a lot of our used to be able to
[8598.36 --> 8603.32]  get a rim job in canada no problem now there are no rim jobs we even exported room jobs
[8606.04 --> 8613.72]  uh but yeah a lot of our tech has been bought and moved away yep now our gaming industry is being
[8613.72 --> 8619.88]  bought and moved away and it's like what do you go to school for to get into industry for in
[8619.88 --> 8627.08]  canada now there is still a lot of stuff you get into medical care that is that is a yeah that is
[8627.08 --> 8633.56]  a space that is getting worse over time um and that's not good and i hope we start doing things
[8633.56 --> 8640.28]  to start uh float plane chat you got to get your mind out of the gunner okay it's a research in motion
[8640.28 --> 8647.32]  job yeah what are you talking about grow up what are they even talking about grow up what is it though
[8647.32 --> 8653.00]  i'm not going to tell you your virgin mind cannot
[8655.64 --> 8662.92]  virgin tongue anyways i'm sad about this there have been oh wow uh there are there are a lot of
[8662.92 --> 8669.64]  ubisoft games that i've really loved over the years um ano is fantastic i've been a huge fan of the
[8669.64 --> 8675.08]  assassin's creed line uh a bunch of the especially i don't know how much credit ubisoft can take for ano
[8675.08 --> 8683.56]  uh yeah sure fair enough yeah like that team's been around killing it since like the 90s and as far
[8683.56 --> 8688.84]  as i know they're they're like kind of isolated yeah ubisoft just publishes for them as far as i can
[8688.84 --> 8696.36]  tell oh i didn't actually realize it was that separated my bad um i know i thought they were a thing within
[8696.36 --> 8704.68]  but i don't i've not like looked this up um oh apparently some ano games have been developed by
[8704.68 --> 8711.48]  ubisoft blue bite german video game holding company owned by ubisoft was founded in blah blah blah so i i
[8711.48 --> 8717.48]  thought they were just all max design uh i didn't realize there was even two so i don't know
[8717.48 --> 8726.44]  oh no defunct 2004 okay yeah it shows you what i know actually uh okay nope nope wait by sunflowers
[8726.44 --> 8734.76]  in collaboration with related to max uh based in schladming uh but company is best known for
[8734.76 --> 8739.16]  creating the ano series the company was closed down in 2004 okay yep shows you what i know then in a
[8739.16 --> 8745.16]  while uh but anyways they've made a lot of games that i have really loved uh but the way the company
[8745.16 --> 8751.24]  has been run has always been highly questionable hence the old keep on digging memes uh the creation
[8751.24 --> 8758.68]  of ubisoft connect or whatever the heck it's even called now you play um was pretty whack
[8760.36 --> 8762.36]  there's been a lot of things that have just been like
[8765.88 --> 8772.84]  not great so i'm not surprised they're in a in a tough spot but it sucks to lose even more canadian
[8772.84 --> 8777.56]  industry and i understand like it's not like ea just like deleted their offices in canada or
[8777.56 --> 8785.08]  anything but i wouldn't be surprised if the focus shifted yeah i know it's about as ubisoft as it gets
[8785.08 --> 8793.40]  it looks like developer for no 1800 is ubisoft blue bite yep so it's it's first party yep sorry about
[8793.40 --> 8799.80]  that uh max design only did the first two back in 1998 and 2002 make sure get that right for you guys
[8799.80 --> 8810.28]  i didn't play those ones oh so yeah i was honestly mostly sad hey you know what you could

[9149.40 --> 9154.92]  of vanilla vanilla it's just the color of the hair in your vanilla ice cream do would you like darker
[9154.92 --> 9156.60]  hair in your vanilla ice cream and a lot
[9156.60 --> 9164.92]  yeah there's so much why why is there so much hair in this ice cream
[9167.16 --> 9173.08]  it's entirely too much it's mostly hair with some vanilla you mean none of them are balding and they
[9173.08 --> 9179.88]  all have beards what's happening right now um my question is where should the hair come from
[9180.68 --> 9189.08]  is it time to get an office cat yeah i went to grab a granola bar from the cupboard before the
[9189.08 --> 9197.56]  wanshow today and my first two attempts the package had been opened by what appeared to be rodent teeth
[9197.56 --> 9202.92]  yeah did i tell you about the one time i took a meeting on the wanset no i had to get a meeting
[9202.92 --> 9207.16]  a meeting with taryn went a little bit long yeah so i couldn't make it over the lab i needed somewhere to
[9207.16 --> 9211.56]  sit i checked the conference room conference room taken i don't have time to just keep checking all
[9211.56 --> 9215.32]  the different areas so i just ran out of the wanset because i knew it would be free i had a meeting
[9215.32 --> 9222.92]  here i had to take a picture really quick for the wan hoodie and i picked up that sign your a plus sign
[9222.92 --> 9228.04]  and held it in front of me and there was i think three spiders on the back and they just left me alone
[9228.04 --> 9232.28]  so i just held it with them there put it back then while i was taking the meeting sitting on the set
[9232.28 --> 9240.44]  i saw not one but two different mice running around the set we could use a cat we could maybe
[9240.44 --> 9247.64]  use two cats one for each building or for each major building so we used to have an employee that
[9247.64 --> 9253.64]  not only was quite allergic to cats but not willing to overcome it like not into cats got it
[9254.36 --> 9257.96]  i think we would have to maybe this could be a subject for the all hands on monday
[9257.96 --> 9264.76]  maybe we could maybe we could just basically go is anyone going to health reasons veto a cat
[9265.48 --> 9272.20]  well we can't do that in public we'd have to allow them to do it privately give us let us know yeah let
[9272.20 --> 9278.68]  us know yeah but otherwise we think we should we think we we need some we could we could use something
[9279.32 --> 9286.84]  i i the lab is infested by flies it's been the solution for thousands of years yeah at this point you
[9286.84 --> 9292.20]  you know little houses that they go into or whatever we're reinventing the wheel the wheel is a cat
[9292.20 --> 9295.96]  yeah so okay all right i'm i
[9299.24 --> 9305.48]  at this point i'm looking at it going okay and if someone does object to it i think i would want to
[9305.48 --> 9310.44]  kind of talk to them and go okay well like here's the issue like are the allergies worse
[9310.44 --> 9316.68]  then because we clearly can't get the rodents under control maybe and maybe and maybe the answer
[9316.68 --> 9321.40]  could absolutely be yes and that would be fine yeah it depends on the severity yeah but are the
[9321.40 --> 9327.32]  allergies worse than the risk of like rodent infestation being a health hazard because we've
[9327.32 --> 9331.88]  we've tried we've got traps freaking everywhere that's pretty but they are but it's a huge space
[9331.88 --> 9338.12]  and literally ran past one so much clutter i was trying to get a video to prove that i saw two
[9338.12 --> 9342.52]  separate mice on the wancho set and while trying to film them which i failed to do because they
[9342.52 --> 9348.68]  were quick um i didn't think of it fast enough i saw one of the traps that they've just very clearly
[9348.68 --> 9358.04]  ran past yeah all right i think it's uh i think it might be time uh arrakis says ferrets are better
[9358.04 --> 9365.72]  mousers and are rarely an allergy concern yeah but they stinky yeah stinky litter box um whereas cats are
[9365.72 --> 9369.88]  we could get a couple robot litter boxes there's a few people that have said that would be a bad
[9369.88 --> 9375.24]  idea but i haven't seen a single person say why i do have calories and it can cause massive long-term
[9375.24 --> 9382.20]  issues massive long-term issues i've never heard of a cat allergy causing long-term issues yeah
[9382.20 --> 9386.84]  neither of us know what's going on so this might just you know not able to be a thing yeah and if it's
[9386.84 --> 9391.16]  not able to be a thing then it won't be a thing keep having mice or we'll put out more traps or
[9391.16 --> 9398.04]  maybe both yeah um could you get one of those hairless ones oh it's the hair that i'd be so
[9398.04 --> 9402.20]  done we could get a peter bald isn't it the like dandruff or whatever that's usually the issue dander
[9402.20 --> 9408.28]  uh but they they apparently have like way less yeah peter bald let's go
[9408.28 --> 9412.84]  right hyper energetic apparently you can also give them food which reduces it so maybe you get one of
[9412.84 --> 9423.32]  these and the food peter bald good look at him ah it's the saliva not the hair wouldn't that make
[9423.32 --> 9426.84]  it easier to deal with it yeah because they don't have to lick themselves as much i think the the
[9426.84 --> 9436.20]  hairless ones um peter bald i don't know what's going on um they are not truly hypoallergenic because
[9436.20 --> 9440.68]  the blah blah blah well their lack of fur can mean less shedding and therefore fewer airborne allergens a
[9440.68 --> 9444.68]  person with a cat allergy can still have a reaction to the proteins in their saliva this is all ai though
[9444.68 --> 9452.52]  so who knows um there are breeds that are supposed to have less um i like elijah's plan can we give
[9452.52 --> 9460.12]  everyone a gun to shoot the mice this isn't texas that's a day air gun it's canada we'll give them a
[9460.12 --> 9467.32]  rifle yeah as long as it's under 495 feet per second sure no problem they're gonna test it is it 495 i
[9467.32 --> 9473.00]  can't remember i don't know paintball guns carat said i'm omega allergic to cats will break out in
[9473.00 --> 9477.88]  hives i imagine other people are as well yeah it's possible surprising to me how common that is
[9479.48 --> 9485.56]  interesting apparently um allergies like kind of had like a peak when we were kids and apparently
[9485.56 --> 9492.44]  some of them are actually declining now like peanut allergies uh are on the decline now because um
[9492.44 --> 9497.72]  um parents are being encouraged to expose their kids earlier or something i was reading about that
[9497.72 --> 9503.24]  the other day pretty wild yeah dude this is such a crazy fact uh try lumen in full plane chat so there's
[9503.24 --> 9507.88]  no rats in alberta have you seen the rat population map of the world yeah it's pretty funny it's nuts
[9507.88 --> 9513.00]  i actually brought that up with linus torvalds his comeback was oh even rats don't want to live there
[9514.04 --> 9520.60]  i was like wow damn shots fired he seems funny i've seen some of his stuff oh yeah he's super funny oh
[9520.60 --> 9532.92]  uh there we go there's just an alberta sized hole boop incredible oh yeah wow i did have it right
[9532.92 --> 9544.04]  495 fps is the below uh maximum until it's considered a firearm in canada neat um hey i love this this
[9544.04 --> 9548.52]  this website that i found cities without rodents in the world alberta canada
[9554.92 --> 9564.68]  not a city but okay good try yeah solid effort yeah oh man uh google will allow experienced users
[9564.68 --> 9571.40]  to install android apps that were made by unverified developers google is walking back their plan to lock
[9571.40 --> 9576.12]  down side loading on android it's good news in august the company announced that starting next
[9576.12 --> 9581.88]  year android users would only be able to install apps made by verified developers now google is saying
[9581.88 --> 9587.24]  that experienced users will still be able to install apps from wherever they want although it will take
[9587.24 --> 9593.24]  a few extra steps and a handful of warnings google claims that the idea here is to curb malware without
[9593.24 --> 9599.96]  completely shutting the door on android's openness the change appears to be a response to heavy pushback
[9599.96 --> 9606.52]  from developers industry groups and everyday users who just didn't love google deciding what trusted
[9606.52 --> 9613.64]  means good reason um disgusting question here is how do you combat companies just arbitrarily determining
[9613.64 --> 9619.40]  what an experienced user is yes trusted app because that's the one thing where i said what does it mean
[9619.40 --> 9623.40]  is what are experienced users experienced user means that you can navigate
[9623.40 --> 9630.60]  you can navigate some prompts like basically what i'm imagining because they've already got warnings
[9630.60 --> 9635.64]  so i'm imagining that maybe you have to do something that's like kind of hidden like the tap five times
[9635.64 --> 9641.88]  to become a developer or whatever thing that's i i'm imagining right now overall i see this as a positive step
[9641.88 --> 9646.12]  and i'm going to try not to be pessimistic about it you gotta get those braces fixed man
[9648.28 --> 9653.32]  when can you when can you get it done how long is it going to be what am i supposed to do what would
[9653.32 --> 9660.04]  you have me do get the is it just the rubbers is it even that what is going on what what is
[9660.04 --> 9669.48]  effect what is this do not put rubbers in my mouth hmm what is it at least not unaccompanied wow wow
[9669.48 --> 9675.72]  who is it so right now i don't wear those this is dentist
[9680.36 --> 9685.72]  you have one that isn't miscolored in the middle of two that are discolored so i can explain that
[9687.00 --> 9695.32]  i can explain that so right now um they are i have a stronger bar in the top than i did a week ago they
[9695.32 --> 9703.88]  put like a thicker one in and um in order to keep my teeth from separating like shifting apart okay
[9703.88 --> 9709.64]  they put what's called a power chain on it and basically sick i know right uh instead of individual
[9709.64 --> 9715.80]  elastics it's a chain of elastics that holds the bar in place and also keeps the teeth together so
[9715.80 --> 9721.56]  that's across the front um the power chain is not available in all the like fun colors that you can put
[9721.56 --> 9725.88]  on if you get the individual ones as far as i know anyway i actually didn't ask i've just been putting
[9725.88 --> 9730.60]  on the clear or the white ones up until now but what's actually causing the discoloration problem
[9730.60 --> 9737.72]  oh yeah so the white ones will discolor especially with um very colorful food so the issue is that i
[9737.72 --> 9743.24]  had nothing but curry for three days so which is wild uh well we actually we ordered too much and my
[9743.24 --> 9748.52]  kids didn't want it so what i'm gonna do throw it away i waste it would you have me waste chicken no oh
[9748.52 --> 9755.08]  no that's what i'm talking about especially not now and i ate all the chicken good so the chicken
[9755.08 --> 9766.52]  was consumed thank yeah exactly 100 success eating the chicken um in addition to that i have clear
[9766.52 --> 9773.64]  chicken sorry i have this uh i have this like uh semi-permanent wax like glue kind of thing that they
[9773.64 --> 9780.36]  they uh paint on top of these brackets and then they cure with a uv light it seems to be pretty
[9780.36 --> 9788.76]  susceptible to curry stain and that's why this one fell off oh wait so it's not the power thing so that
[9788.76 --> 9794.52]  will turn color yeah as well but i've only had that for a week so it's actually the glue that's on top
[9794.52 --> 9804.52]  oh and if i don't wear it um these ceramic brackets they sit super proud off the tooth and uh i don't
[9804.52 --> 9810.52]  think yeah i don't i don't think you'll be able to tell but you can go for it like
[9813.00 --> 9815.88]  oh that's rough oh that's really rough they are
[9815.88 --> 9823.64]  ludicrously sharp that's rough um like i've had braces before yeah the metal ones are you've
[9823.64 --> 9829.40]  mentioned that they're proud off the tooth those are crazy and so they sit prouder off the tooth and
[9829.40 --> 9836.28]  they are ridiculously sharp and they're sharp they have sharp corners and they're ceramic they're not
[9836.28 --> 9841.96]  smooth they have a kind of a texture it feels like they should have been able to solve the sharpness you
[9841.96 --> 9848.76]  would think so that's nuts um i'm surprised this isn't like a more widely known issue because i
[9848.76 --> 9855.64]  can't imagine how that wouldn't irritate the inside so as far as i can tell the company that makes these
[9855.64 --> 9864.60]  um helps there be positive media about it but you can find people complaining about how sharp they are
[9865.16 --> 9871.16]  but uh i didn't google it i just was like oh yeah i don't know 3d printed ceramic and it's faster yeah
[9871.16 --> 9878.52]  let's do that one i i strongly regret the choice that i made the inside of my mouth is always shredded
[9878.52 --> 9884.28]  and these glue things they'll stay on i can't imagine how it wouldn't be anywhere from a week to
[9884.28 --> 9890.36]  like a month um and then i but like my ortho's been pretty good about it i can go and i can just drop in
[9890.36 --> 9896.52]  i don't have to make an appointment i can go in any time and get them to to reapply them um but literally
[9896.52 --> 9903.16]  if it meant that my teeth could not look yellow um i don't even care because i'm going to have that
[9903.16 --> 9909.48]  glue on my teeth yeah and i'm going to keep eating butter chicken so go yourself is there is there some
[9909.48 --> 9916.28]  can you discolor it with something else um because yellow is particularly would i look better purple
[9916.28 --> 9922.28]  like what are you even getting at here i think i should eat beets i think so because like in in
[9922.28 --> 9928.36]  your peripheral view it's just like a glow of yellow which is yeah yeah i saw some comments so
[9928.36 --> 9933.80]  so there were there were some new some new folks watching the uh the steam frame and steam machine
[9933.80 --> 9939.00]  videos those were far and away out performers for our channel so there's been some kind of new viewers
[9939.00 --> 9944.60]  coming in or people who haven't been around for a while and so there was uh more than you know with
[9944.60 --> 9950.12]  the core audience that watches all the time comments on the braces or and some that i apparently
[9950.12 --> 9954.28]  don't brush my teeth it's like no no i brush my teeth in fact i have to work very hard to brush my
[9954.28 --> 9960.36]  teeth because of my stupid orthodontics that are all over them but it's okay it'll only be another year
[9965.72 --> 9971.80]  you want your teeth to be yellow for a year dude no yeah i don't want it i wonder like someone's
[9971.80 --> 9979.88]  someone suggested kool-aid kool-aid to color them a different color what why would i do that i'm not
[9979.88 --> 9987.56]  gonna do that i'm not gonna do that like green would that be better red what would you prefer you pick a
[9987.56 --> 9993.96]  pink pink teeth would look better no that would follow your style diseased yeah
[9993.96 --> 10000.12]  there's no proper color for teeth except white or a little bit yellow those are the only natural
[10000.12 --> 10007.08]  colors for teeth i'm sorry that's not a little bit yellow dude the curry was worth it it was delicious
[10007.64 --> 10014.20]  it's like the yellow in the mountain on your starry night shirt it's like that yellow it's it's not
[10014.84 --> 10015.64]  slightly yellow
[10015.64 --> 10022.52]  actually i have a bar of yellow hold on it's like it's like in here
[10025.32 --> 10032.84]  you start g76 okay outstanding uh they use different recipes at some of the locations so i
[10032.84 --> 10038.12]  can't really speak to any of the ones other than he just takes a photo standing in front of it and
[10038.12 --> 10045.16]  it's mostly of him other than surrey central store yep that's incredible this guy that's so good i
[10045.16 --> 10050.60]  asked the staff if he's like this in person and they were like yep he's just wearing a gucci jacket
[10050.60 --> 10057.24]  in one of them he is apparently he's not in these he is apparently exactly like this that sucks he's
[10057.24 --> 10062.12]  exactly like you would imagine and this is the kind of like decor they have i don't know if they have
[10062.12 --> 10066.28]  any pictures of the insides of the restaurants but like they always have mr bean playing in this one on
[10066.28 --> 10071.72]  the uh on the tv like the animated mr bean it's i don't know it's super weird but it's good it's
[10071.72 --> 10078.60]  good curry there's one showing up in langley city nice i'm excited about that solid solid you stat g76
[10079.16 --> 10085.88]  quality my favorite indian food place is gone oh really yeah which one masala indian bistro oh bummer
[10085.88 --> 10092.12]  yeah yeah my my old favorite was actually taken over by ustad g and i got lucky because it's even better
[10092.12 --> 10097.80]  uh it used to be called taste of punjab that one and then uh ustad g came in and put some artificial
[10097.80 --> 10103.64]  turf up on the walls okay so literally every single time the flow plane team visits we go to
[10103.64 --> 10108.92]  masala yeah aj's pointing out our tradition we go to masala every time because it's like a few of their
[10108.92 --> 10112.60]  favorite restaurants but like especially jonathan but like a few of people's favorite restaurants
[10112.60 --> 10115.96]  um and i don't think any of them knew it was permanently closed yet but yeah yeah
[10115.96 --> 10123.24]  you start g76 maybe yeah we'll have to we'll have to do something because masala i call it
[10123.24 --> 10131.00]  masala but there's a bunch of he is a g it does kind of fit it does really fit like how dyed is that facial
[10131.00 --> 10133.64]  hair yeah
[10136.92 --> 10142.84]  but yeah it's gone if you if you if you google it it's gone and it was really highly rated and i honestly
[10142.84 --> 10151.64]  don't know why it's gone i hope it's for some good reason yeah probably not probably not they had a
[10151.64 --> 10158.92]  lot of people there it was really good very good speaking of good reasons jack dorsey felt he had a
[10158.92 --> 10168.12]  good reason to fund divine a vine reboot that includes vine's video archive and bands ai content however
[10168.12 --> 10174.52]  they're going to enforce that jack dorsey is backing the vine a reboot of vine through his non-profit
[10174.52 --> 10179.48]  and other stuff which is interesting because twitter owned the old vine before shutting it down in
[10179.48 --> 10188.12]  january of 2017. the app was created by current and other stuff um and former twitter employee evan
[10188.12 --> 10195.48]  henshaw plath aka rabble using data previously stored by archive team which is also not the same as the
[10195.48 --> 10202.92]  archive.org team rabble was able to restore 150 to 200 000 original vines from 60 000 creators who can
[10202.92 --> 10209.24]  contact him if they want to take control of their reconstructed accounts divine breaks from its short
[10209.24 --> 10214.76]  form video brethren by banning ai generated content it'll use tech from the human rights non-profit the
[10214.76 --> 10221.72]  guardian project to confirm that a clip was truly captured on a smartphone huh i mean okay i wish them
[10222.44 --> 10228.28]  does that work really good anyone no idea plus because it's built on nostr a decentralized protocol
[10228.28 --> 10232.04]  favored by dorsey and is open source okay i'm actually starting to think it might be cool
[10232.04 --> 10236.28]  developers can set up and create their own apps and run their own hosts relays and media servers you know
[10236.28 --> 10243.24]  what you know how did that suddenly get really cool right at the end that started pretty and uh now i'm
[10243.24 --> 10249.32]  open to it that was really fast yeah i think that's about the fastest i've had my mind changed on
[10249.32 --> 10258.28]  something in recent times yeah okay all right dorsey i'll bite not everything you've done has been
[10258.28 --> 10266.36]  super duper amazing across the board if we want another weird update that's like sort of related to
[10266.36 --> 10273.48]  this uh this page got an update dig dig got an update we talked about this a while ago that they
[10273.48 --> 10278.20]  were launching dig again but now there's like a tagline for it humanity at the core technology
[10278.20 --> 10281.96]  at the edges we're building a human first community platform that places authentic
[10281.96 --> 10286.84]  community and connection at the forefront from day one i got an invite i've been too busy to actually
[10286.84 --> 10290.20]  sign up for it but i got an invite for this so maybe i'll be able to check it out and we can talk
[10290.20 --> 10299.72]  about it later um but it's interesting man that reddit has so much inertia oh yeah
[10299.72 --> 10306.28]  yeah wouldn't even describe it as momentum it's more like inertia it just has this like mass
[10308.60 --> 10316.68]  that is just it's it's impossible to replicate for a new platform yeah um our discussion question
[10316.68 --> 10321.96]  for the vine thing divine is um how is short form video evolved since fine's departure i mean honestly
[10321.96 --> 10328.44]  is it it's pretty similar yeah i think it's pretty similar it's got less uh meme-y and funny and
[10328.44 --> 10335.72]  it's a little bit more definitely more addictive yeah like the the the masters of it have had a lot
[10335.72 --> 10343.48]  more time to master it dude it's still fascinating that lime vine sorry ever shut down fascinating
[10343.48 --> 10348.92]  yeah gotta be one of the craziest fumbles ever periscope sure yeah what was its value add
[10349.56 --> 10357.88]  um i mean vine was wild i mean i didn't care about vine um but so many people did some of the
[10357.88 --> 10363.16]  those popular videos on youtube when vine was around was vine compilation like it's still it's
[10363.16 --> 10369.64]  like part of my personality yeah like yeah yeah i don't know like i i have to confess i didn't really
[10369.64 --> 10375.72]  get it i didn't really care didn't care about short form video um but it's it's clear that a lot of
[10375.72 --> 10383.64]  people did i mean i guess the idea was just to migrate those users to twitter but then it was never quite
[10383.64 --> 10389.72]  the same it's just it really captured like when we're talking silicon valley and capturing eyeballs
[10389.72 --> 10396.20]  it like really captured eyeballs i don't know i don't know if uh capping people at six seconds is
[10396.20 --> 10402.12]  still going to be interesting i don't know if that's gonna work that was sort of some of its downfall
[10402.12 --> 10407.96]  it did improve some of the quality because you actually had to construct a narrative in six seconds
[10407.96 --> 10412.28]  yeah you a lot of people i've heard recently complain about tick tock because you'll it'll be
[10412.28 --> 10416.36]  like a one minute video and they just kind of never get to the point yeah you have to construct
[10416.36 --> 10421.40]  something in six seconds but yeah how do you monetize it cat os points out they did get rid of that in
[10421.40 --> 10427.80]  the in the at near the end and then what's the point it's just tick tock but yeah but tick tock wasn't
[10427.80 --> 10434.76]  around too slow which is which is my point which is like vine was freaking huge i mean if you look at the
[10434.76 --> 10441.64]  people that just because vine died moved over to youtube and then became massive youtubers absolutely
[10441.64 --> 10447.24]  they had just smash hit as much as i might not like all of them they had smash hit creators on vine
[10448.04 --> 10455.16]  it was like a cultural phenomenon and they just shut it down wild i mean no one ever said twitter was
[10455.16 --> 10456.20]  a well-run company
[10456.20 --> 10466.44]  at any point at any point i mean that's been your stance has been pretty pretty clear on twitter being
[10466.44 --> 10472.92]  a dumpster fire then and now so is this really the only useful thing about twitter is that practically
[10472.92 --> 10480.12]  everyone has an account and you can dm people i'm thinking about just deleting mine though i think i just
[10480.12 --> 10486.52]  might be done i still use the dm portion often enough that i don't want to get rid of it it is
[10486.52 --> 10490.28]  still the easiest way for me to reach out to someone that i don't know and get a response
[10491.16 --> 10496.60]  unless that changes i don't see myself deleting my account i used to use more than twitter yeah but
[10496.60 --> 10502.84]  how do you find the person if i don't know the person yet yeah well i guess i still okay so i have
[10502.84 --> 10507.64]  the luxury of still having the corporate twitter if i really need to so i could make a connection with
[10507.64 --> 10511.88]  that which is you know it's verified whatever that means these days and it's yeah got a big
[10511.88 --> 10516.84]  follower account so it should you know yeah and to be clear i like really don't use it that often
[10516.84 --> 10521.80]  but if i'm like hmm this one person that i know of would be like really useful to talk to you about
[10521.80 --> 10529.96]  this one topic but i've never actually had a contact with them um yeah that's totally valid jump on
[10529.96 --> 10535.72]  twitter find them it's the same reason i have facebook except that's for getting in touch with family
[10535.72 --> 10542.84]  in your life yeah that exactly i see no value to facebook anymore except marketplace well yeah
[10542.84 --> 10549.48]  marketplace is very and fied now but for only you all the rest of us get boring marketplace and you
[10549.48 --> 10554.60]  get all the fun one no i ruined mine no i actually bought some stuff and now it's ruined there was
[10554.60 --> 10560.68]  someone on reddit talking about how they were linus training their i saw that dude really funny crazy
[10560.68 --> 10564.60]  that it worked immediate results so sick so sick
[10567.56 --> 10571.32]  training my marketplace to shoot an email next time then you might meet torvalds
[10572.12 --> 10579.88]  here here it is uh one week update on my marketplace training taco bell nine feet tall good potential
[10579.88 --> 10590.12]  uranium glass slag question mark spirit s1 lsa shiny plane bmw five tons six by six
[10590.12 --> 10595.88]  bmw excuse me full tank of gas for a ti 84 ce plus calculator
[10598.12 --> 10606.20]  vertical machining centers sure full-size traffic light retired plastic jersey barriers
[10607.32 --> 10612.68]  there's so much crazy stuff on facebook marketplace so cool you just have to be brave enough to click it
[10612.68 --> 10622.68]  i love my favorite one was the potential uranium glass question mark yeah i loved that who knows what it is not me so good pay me
[10623.40 --> 10625.56]  pay me like what even is this
[10627.80 --> 10636.68]  uh ai artist tops country music chart kind of kind of i hate this time ai generated music has routinely been charting
[10636.68 --> 10644.12]  over the past month or so but the track walk my walk by breaking rust has landed at the top of billboard's country
[10644.12 --> 10652.44]  digital song sales chart with over three million streams on spotify which is a ton but not why it's up there
[10653.16 --> 10659.72]  it should be noted however that the digital song sales chart is not a mainstream chart and only required
[10659.72 --> 10666.28]  3 000 sales in order to be topped sales are either 150 streams or a purchase from itunes this means you
[10666.28 --> 10671.24]  can easily top the chart with an itunes gift card and some bots and this is what i was going to add to
[10671.24 --> 10679.24]  this topic that i don't see in the comments but a lot of the comments on it are clearly bought
[10679.24 --> 10682.36]  botted definitely clearly and if you're going to bought comments
[10682.36 --> 10690.68]  why not bought streams yeah um as an example disturbs cover of the sound of silence which is an
[10690.68 --> 10695.88]  awful cover says adam sondergaard i'm not taking a position on this has been at the top of the
[10695.88 --> 10702.04]  alternative digital song sales chart for 400 weeks that's a few that's wild that is a few casual eight
[10702.04 --> 10708.12]  years another ai artist zania monet has been making headlines after signing a three million dollar record
[10708.12 --> 10714.12]  deal and her gospel track let's go let's go garnering millions of views across platforms that's not it
[10717.72 --> 10725.80]  that's not the title of the song what is it oh let go let god sorry i i yep yeah that makes more sense
[10725.80 --> 10731.40]  that doesn't actually make a lot more sense or wait i guess it kind of does let go let
[10731.40 --> 10738.28]  it's i so it's jesus take the wheel which is far as far as my understanding is not the lessons you're
[10738.28 --> 10746.36]  supposed to take but i mean it's been a while so i could be wrong you could be i i wouldn't presume to i
[10748.12 --> 10755.56]  i can't i can't see it's fascinating having a ai artist do religious songs there's god there's
[10755.56 --> 10763.88]  something in there somewhere something in there somewhere yep yep um discussion questions would
[10763.88 --> 10772.92]  you go to the concert of a virtual artist i mean no no okay cool next question how is this different
[10772.92 --> 10777.40]  from bands like gorillas what about hatsune miku which performs songs written by a community
[10777.40 --> 10785.40]  well it's different because humans crafted that whereas this didn't next question can there be true
[10785.40 --> 10792.44]  artistic intent behind ai music artistic intent okay well hold on a second i could see a poet
[10792.44 --> 10799.64]  making an argument that if they human crafted lyrics and then an ai like generated song something them
[10799.64 --> 10806.12]  there was at least some there was less than there was more than zero dirt dragon raises a very
[10806.12 --> 10811.48]  interesting point all right hit me we should make we shouldn't we probably won't even need to make it
[10811.48 --> 10816.44]  happen it'll just happen but if it doesn't just happen we should make the riley i'm taking a
[10816.44 --> 10824.04]  christmas album top the charts what by botting it yeah you want to improve ai adoption yeah might as
[10824.04 --> 10832.92]  well use it for evil i mean good yeah sometimes they might be the same yeah uh he just left should we do
[10832.92 --> 10842.92]  something uh there's some topics in here that are not fully planned out so i won't do those what do we do
[10844.52 --> 10849.96]  it's not normal to have him just leave randomly does he i mean does he not want to talk about this
[10849.96 --> 10859.48]  interesting i can talk about this other topic uh sony announced a cheaper japanese language only ps5
[10859.48 --> 10865.56]  exclusive to japan and they also revealed a playstation monitor the playstation monitor is
[10866.36 --> 10871.00]  wild we'll talk about that in a second sony announced a cheaper japanese all that kind of stuff
[10871.00 --> 10877.24]  it's the first time they've region locked a console since the ps2 back in the year 2000
[10877.24 --> 10883.32]  uh like nintendo's japan only switch 2 model this special ps5 is sony's attempt at making the
[10883.32 --> 10889.56]  console more affordable domestically sony also announced a playstation branded gaming monitor
[10889.56 --> 10896.60]  the 2560 by 1440 monitor has an ips panel and a 240 hertz refresh rate but the 240 hertz refresh
[10896.60 --> 10905.64]  is only available when hooked up to a pc which is what very interesting what does that mean it just runs
[10905.64 --> 10914.20]  at 120 hertz when connected to playstation consoles huh and it has a dual sense charging hook they are
[10914.20 --> 10920.44]  publishing their games on steam and pc now this is maybe not that weird the whole industry is getting
[10920.44 --> 10926.52]  very strange what is happening it's all topsy-turvy the weirdest out of all of it we're gonna hit xbox on
[10926.52 --> 10935.16]  the gamecube it's like it's it's a weird i don't know what's happening sony hasn't priced the monitor
[10935.16 --> 10941.80]  they don't quote response times or brightness and even sony's quoted hdr capability is vague at best
[10941.80 --> 10949.72]  with pc gamers saying that the monitor doesn't seem like a hugely compelling proposition for pc gaming
[10952.92 --> 10958.60]  interesting when we don't even know the price that's interesting discussion question do you have
[10958.60 --> 10963.40]  any memorable experiences with region locked products ifds tell us your tales if you don't have
[10963.40 --> 10970.92]  any anecdotes what are your opinions on region locking in general i don't like region locking
[10970.92 --> 10977.32]  i am conflicted on the it's cheaper domestically thing i think it's kind of based even though i'm
[10977.32 --> 10985.08]  not going to benefit from it and then how do you do that while actually making it so that it's cheaper
[10985.08 --> 10991.32]  for everyone because they just order the the ones in japan um so i don't know but in general i think
[10991.32 --> 11000.28]  region locking is kind of bad because it promotes e-waste problems um what do you think yeah i think
[11000.28 --> 11006.20]  so i mean these days it's just kind of strange to region lock anything just because extremely
[11006.20 --> 11013.40]  unnecessary the whole world is super global now yeah pal mtse is no longer a thing no no i mean
[11013.40 --> 11024.36]  my my thought would be taxes export that sort of stuff um you know i know japan is a little strange in
[11024.36 --> 11030.92]  some regards i mean there's talk of flying to japan to get like things cheaper than you could just
[11030.92 --> 11036.36]  importing them um which is which is very odd i wonder if that has to sorry i thought you're done
[11036.36 --> 11040.52]  talking for something go for it binky draws i can't see you so i was about to say it's really
[11040.52 --> 11045.88]  hard yeah binky draw says is it actually region locked or is it only sold in one region and i
[11045.88 --> 11051.40]  don't technically know but it says in here region locked which would make me think it's not just only
[11051.40 --> 11059.56]  sold there another discussion discussion question what comes to mind is your favorite unexpected
[11059.56 --> 11066.12]  console branded product or peripherals the you know playstation 3d tv gamecube or dreamcast keyboard
[11066.12 --> 11071.24]  etc and i don't think i have one
[11074.84 --> 11080.76]  that's very boring but i think it's true very few come to mind because it specifically says
[11080.76 --> 11085.00]  unexpected so i i would traditionally say just like xbox controllers because i like them so much
[11085.00 --> 11092.44]  more than playstation once what about that kfc thing was that real uh that's also or is that no
[11092.44 --> 11097.56]  that's that's the opposite yeah yeah yeah yeah darn i'm trying to think of anything floatplane
[11097.56 --> 11102.92]  chat do you have anything i don't think i have an example i don't have an example at all oops oh well
[11102.92 --> 11107.24]  uh but yeah that's that's kind of funky and weird what is your thought on them making it cheaper
[11107.88 --> 11113.48]  in japan what do you think about that well that's kind of that makes me think that is definitely some
[11113.48 --> 11119.40]  sort of like you know export thing yeah i feel like if there was a canadian company and they made
[11119.40 --> 11125.64]  it cheaper for canadians i would think that was cool i'm fine with that yeah i think if they're
[11125.64 --> 11134.76]  basically sacrificing sacrificing their like margins um locally and putting it up elsewhere that's that's
[11134.76 --> 11140.28]  fine sacrifice is that when you pretend to kill someone to appease the gods yeah it sounds like
[11140.28 --> 11144.44]  it or do you actually kill someone to appease a fake god oh a sacrifice
[11147.24 --> 11151.08]  i think it could be either maybe it's one of those words with two definitions did i interrupt uh
[11151.08 --> 11157.16]  only slightly uh playstation 5 exclusive version in japan it's region locked but it's cheaper
[11157.80 --> 11163.32]  also they released a monitor region locks are anti-consumer and should always be objected to
[11163.32 --> 11167.88]  yeah yeah it's cheaper just like naming it the same thing when it's actually a different product
[11167.88 --> 11173.32]  we should always object to that it's cheaper for them so i think this is their way of making it
[11173.32 --> 11180.36]  cheaper for japanese people why is it cheaper for them this is fairly normal and if it's only sold in
[11180.36 --> 11186.68]  japan and it's cheaper no i mean what what do you mean it's cheaper for them like for sony this region
[11186.68 --> 11194.92]  no for japanese people people in japan okay but you can only use it in japan or with japanese games
[11194.92 --> 11200.60]  or other stuff the regional thing correctly which i think we are no it's still anti-consumer yeah they
[11200.60 --> 11205.80]  should just sell it for like more cheaper in japan if they really want to but then that's going to get
[11205.80 --> 11212.52]  abused immediately obviously but then like if they can afford to sell it for that much then they should
[11212.52 --> 11217.40]  just do that obviously not how that works you know that i mean even shipping something out of japan
[11217.40 --> 11222.84]  like it would have to be markedly cheaper for it to not make more sense to just that's fair buy it
[11222.84 --> 11229.24]  somewhere else when it's been shipped in bulk i don't know how much the discount is 5 500 55 000 yen
[11229.24 --> 11230.28]  yeah let's convert that
[11233.88 --> 11242.36]  usd wow that's really cheap 355 compared to the the normal one was is this a pro or is it normal i think
[11242.36 --> 11248.68]  it's normal digital edition so it's the non-disc normal one yeah it's still 350 bucks okay yeah
[11248.68 --> 11254.28]  people would buy 500 people would buy them in bulk yeah and ship them overseas um
[11258.60 --> 11263.96]  all right i'm thinking how else could you do this i don't think you can
[11266.12 --> 11270.76]  i don't like that there's region locking i agree i think it's anti-consumer as well i don't like it i think
[11270.76 --> 11277.16]  it's a bad contributor to things like e-waste and just not good things in general yeah but i also
[11277.16 --> 11281.64]  think it's kind of cool that they're offering a domestic discount i'd be okay with it if they
[11281.64 --> 11287.72]  committed to unlock it like when it's x amount of years down the line yeah that's cool i like that
[11287.72 --> 11290.68]  i think that would be a good compromise a lot um
[11293.32 --> 11295.96]  if the ps6 launches you unlock all of them
[11295.96 --> 11306.44]  thinking or like a year into the ps6 being around okay how would you feel about a device that rather
[11306.44 --> 11313.32]  than being region locked was cheaper up front but the games were more expensive
[11315.08 --> 11321.48]  what about a global unlock code so you have it in japan i'm just i'm just chit-chatting now
[11322.20 --> 11327.96]  oh so this has nothing yeah what if they had a 300 playstation 5 but every game costs like 20 more
[11329.16 --> 11333.48]  knowing that most people will buy like between five and a dozen games or whatever so they they make
[11333.48 --> 11337.56]  their money in the longer term but it's basically it's choose your own adventure on whether you want
[11337.56 --> 11341.88]  one that's priced profitably in the first place with cheaper games or whether you want one that's
[11341.88 --> 11344.68]  priced cheaper but you know you're going to pay more for the games
[11344.68 --> 11352.36]  if you still had the option to buy the full price one would you object to them having like a cheaper
[11352.92 --> 11357.88]  subsidized game i don't think so if you still had the option there's definitely people that will buy
[11357.88 --> 11364.68]  a console for two games yeah even one game in certain cases so that was fascinating to me when
[11364.68 --> 11369.96]  i first found out that there was like people who would play starcraft and not video games they would
[11369.96 --> 11377.16]  just play starcraft there was no other video games that they ever played i was like oh wow and
[11377.16 --> 11380.68]  then i started realizing that that was true for a bunch of different games i just first discovered
[11380.68 --> 11389.72]  it was starcraft my life for hire see i thought they were mercenaries my life for hire for the
[11389.72 --> 11390.68]  longest time yeah
[11390.68 --> 11400.52]  that's fairly reasonable i i never like thought about that but but yeah it does kind of sound
[11400.52 --> 11406.44]  like hire i didn't know what zealot meant so i just yeah i just thought zealot i'm pretty sure
[11406.44 --> 11413.40]  is the right way to say it i'm fairly certain i said zealot oh i 100 did yeah so many years 100 so many
[11413.40 --> 11422.04]  years um anyways i don't think there's much more unpacking of that i really like the idea of the
[11422.04 --> 11428.52]  region lock just being timed though i think that's really cool i like that a lot it's pretty funny that
[11428.52 --> 11434.68]  the monitor only runs at its maximum capabilities hooked up to a pc uh all right cool well did you
[11434.68 --> 11441.00]  guys already talk through this yeah okay all right cool we can close that then uh what else we got uh
[11442.76 --> 11449.40]  there's lots yeah there is there's so much uh we can do here a couple rapid fire topics a group of us
[11449.40 --> 11457.48]  lawyers has documented 509 cases of ai misuse in court filings no notes that's terrible that's rough the uk
[11457.48 --> 11464.92]  is probing whether chinese-made yutong electric buses on british roads can be remotely disabled um
[11467.88 --> 11474.52]  yeah so this is bad because norway discovered that its chinese-made buses can be remotely turned off
[11474.52 --> 11483.00]  by the manufacturer um this needs to not be a thing and not specifically because these buses are made in china
[11483.56 --> 11491.08]  but again because like calling a product the same thing or region locking it's just bad when you buy
[11491.08 --> 11496.76]  something you bought from anywhere and you should have easy access to find information about it and
[11496.76 --> 11504.84]  you should have the right to use it in whatever the country you want that's it i object your honor
[11504.84 --> 11516.12]  what else we got hackers speaking of right to repair and right to use things you bought hackers are
[11516.12 --> 11522.12]  reviving google's discontinued nest thermostats with an open source project called no longer evil yes
[11522.68 --> 11529.40]  amazing name hard to believe incredible name google recently abandoned their nest thermostats making them
[11529.40 --> 11534.44]  no longer smart because google moved them to end of life and ripped functionality out of them they were
[11534.44 --> 11545.24]  launched between 2011 and 2014. cody kosiemba has personal incentive to revive these thermostats due to prior clashes with google
[11545.24 --> 11552.36]  but also a possible fifteen thousand dollar financial incentive from fulu to bring bricked devices back to life
[11553.72 --> 11559.80]  this is cool the thermostat believes that it is communicating with the official nest infrastructure but instead
[11559.80 --> 11565.48]  connects to the no longer evil platform this approach ensures full compatibility with the device's existing
[11565.48 --> 11571.80]  software while breaking free from google's cloud dependency the firmware images and back-end api server
[11571.80 --> 11577.56]  code will be open sourced soon allowing the community to audit improve and self-host their own infrastructure
[11577.56 --> 11582.84]  how cool is this the firmware upgrade from github is still in the development stage so the usual
[11582.84 --> 11589.72]  precautions apply but it can be easily integrated into home assistant using mqtt or rest apis after
[11589.72 --> 11595.32]  applying the firmware the user will be met with a new greeting now made with 100 less evil freaking
[11596.44 --> 11600.76]  love it and our discussion question is should right to repair regulations be updated to include rules that
[11600.76 --> 11607.72]  provide immortality for evil devices the answer is yes it needs to be done yesterday this needs to be
[11607.72 --> 11615.48]  dealt with instead of whatever the crap it is that legislators are doing right now um oh there's more
[11615.48 --> 11622.76]  bad news though memory prices are set to skyrocket due to demand from ai data centers this was prepared by
[11622.76 --> 11632.84]  mr pankratz sandisk has reportedly raised its nand flash price contracts by 50 for november numerous module
[11632.84 --> 11639.56]  makers have paused shipments to re-evaluate their quotes transcend has suspended quoting and deliveries
[11639.56 --> 11646.84]  starting november 7th anticipating this is a quote favorable market conditions this comes as the memory
[11646.84 --> 11653.00]  market is being dominated by demand from ai data centers and constrained wafer supply so this is a really
[11653.00 --> 11658.12]  important point for folks that are looking at this going well why is ddr4 ram affected that's older
[11658.12 --> 11665.96]  why is gamer memory affected it's because you still make ram out of the same wafer whether it's
[11665.96 --> 11672.68]  going into a server or a phone or a laptop or a gaming computer or whatever the case may be okay that's
[11672.68 --> 11678.44]  not quite true like ddr4 ram might actually not necessarily be made on the latest nodes but still
[11678.44 --> 11687.32]  in general you are constrained by how much fab time there is um so in response to constrained wafer supply oh
[11687.32 --> 11691.88]  it's the wafer supply specifically okay not okay so it would be constrained by supply of the actual
[11691.88 --> 11697.08]  wafer so that would affect any manufacturing process so in response manufacturers have shifted their
[11697.08 --> 11703.24]  production focus away from products like consumer ssds and ddr4 to more profitable ddr5 and hbm this is
[11703.24 --> 11710.28]  causing a rise in pricing across all memory related products uh here's an interesting memory price trend
[11710.28 --> 11717.24]  page from pc part picker whoopsie doodles here's the last 18 months stable stable stable stable stable
[11717.24 --> 11724.52]  stable oh no edr4 3600 stable stable down down down up up stable stable stable
[11727.56 --> 11728.92]  yeah so this blows
[11735.80 --> 11736.12]  neat
[11739.88 --> 11744.28]  while customers are left scrambling to adapt transcend inno disk and apacer are reporting revenue
[11744.28 --> 11750.92]  increases exceeding 60 year over year for q3 so bully for them i suppose um discussion question
[11750.92 --> 11755.80]  is if you're looking to purchase flash storage or ram would you aim to buy now or try to wait it out
[11755.80 --> 11763.56]  you could be waiting it out a very long time um ai data center demand won't collapse until the bubble
[11763.56 --> 11770.04]  pops and what is what is it they say the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain
[11770.04 --> 11777.48]  solvent solvent yeah yeah yeah yeah fun times in other news uh ai powered russian humanoid robot
[11777.48 --> 11784.44]  walks on stage and falls on its face sounds about right i um all the uh all the non-russian ones are
[11784.44 --> 11788.36]  held up by chains and cables so i don't know who's doing better i don't think that's true
[11789.00 --> 11793.72]  unitree looks pretty memeing impressive at this point uh here's a video over on
[11793.72 --> 11799.88]  yeah unitree's dope here's a video from blue sky oh
[11802.04 --> 11815.32]  wow this is very far behind oh boy and oh wow oh wow and there it goes oh oh
[11816.76 --> 11821.56]  it's funny you could tell they knew it was screwed yeah you could tell that it's uh it's russian because
[11821.56 --> 11831.32]  it had some vodka before it went out on stage wow wow wow um the creators accompanying the robot
[11831.32 --> 11835.80]  and some crew immediately try to pull the robot off stage and hide broken leftover pieces with a
[11835.80 --> 11843.16]  large black cloth after aldol that's the name of the robot um threw itself off a building sorry i mean
[11843.16 --> 11852.76]  fell over on the stage oh here's another fun one this is another kind of rapid fire one we sponsored a
[11852.76 --> 11853.72]  smaller creator
[11855.80 --> 11864.92]  rude you might have heard of them oh my god ads love it hey but this is uh also a much smaller sponsorship
[11864.92 --> 11870.92]  watching their ad hold on i gotta find it
[11875.48 --> 11879.40]  i actually don't know where the uh spot there it is hey you might know this guy
[11880.76 --> 11886.12]  i think i've seen him before i've seen some very interesting speculation that we are like on terrible
[11886.12 --> 11893.40]  terms or something with people who leave the team or you know whatever it is our earnest goal
[11893.40 --> 11901.48]  to be on good terms with anyone who departs here and uh it is our genuine
[11902.60 --> 11909.40]  wish that they continue to be successful outside of lmg um i mean look at it this way
[11910.68 --> 11918.52]  let's let's assume that i was entirely driven by my own narcissistic ego assume let's assume that
[11918.52 --> 11929.80]  we don't know that but let's assume it would i want someone to have a five-year career or 10-year career
[11929.80 --> 11938.68]  here and not come out with useful skills such that they could be a success right it would it would just
[11938.68 --> 11945.40]  speak more well to you if they did how would that reflect on your company me and this organization
[11946.68 --> 11951.32]  i mean i'm always talking about it world-class team you know
[11953.64 --> 11963.00]  let's assume the worst possible set of assumptions about me even then would i have an interest in people
[11963.00 --> 11968.36]  flying free and then falling flat on their faces if it's worse possible assumptions then
[11969.00 --> 11975.48]  sure but i'm extrapolating this a little bit too far i mean okay i mean the worst possible
[11975.48 --> 11981.80]  reasonable assumptions about my character oh you added reasonable though we're okay what what
[11981.80 --> 11985.88]  assumptions could you make about my character such that i would want alex and andy to fail if it's
[11985.88 --> 11992.28]  worst possible assumptions that i could make anything you just like hate people and everyone
[11992.28 --> 11998.12]  and you want it's like that quote of like my success means nothing if others do not also fail
[11999.00 --> 12006.12]  have you heard that before uh but but my success can also be measured by the success of people that i
[12006.12 --> 12012.68]  agree i agree you said worst possible i guess that would be that would be terrible there's people like that
[12012.68 --> 12024.68]  um okay i mean that's really stupid um anyway yeah so the the point is i'm i'm very i'm very excited this is
[12024.68 --> 12036.20]  actually not the only um move yeah that you guys will uh that you guys will see we've got some some
[12036.20 --> 12040.92]  pretty cool i don't i don't want to t i don't want to spoil anything because i don't want to take any of the
[12040.92 --> 12046.04]  the wind out of the sails of the people who are going to be you know doing their own because because
[12046.04 --> 12050.04]  that's that's the thing right is they're on their own they're doing their own thing which i'm i'm very
[12050.04 --> 12056.68]  pro entrepreneurship i've always been pro small creators i've always been pro consumer i've always
[12056.68 --> 12062.20]  been pro entrepreneurship so i want to see people spread their wings and fly and i want to let them
[12062.20 --> 12067.64]  kind of talk about the partnership in their own authentic voice before i go and put any words in their
[12067.64 --> 12079.24]  mouth but this will not be the last um this will not be the last sort of collaboration slash partnership
[12079.24 --> 12085.40]  with people who used to be on payroll and no longer are it might not be hard to i think it's cool
[12085.40 --> 12092.84]  stretch that far uh considering you did personally go out of your way to make us that i couldn't meet linus torvalds
[12092.84 --> 12102.28]  so you know that even if only 0.1 percent of people are stupid enough to believe you right now
[12103.88 --> 12113.72]  that is still 10 people so you now way to go but there's also the vaud you me 10 times plus the vaud
[12113.72 --> 12116.76]  that's not enough i gotta pump those numbers up
[12121.40 --> 12126.12]  oh man yeah it's cool i i think that's awesome um
[12129.96 --> 12131.88]  very cool people have any questions
[12135.16 --> 12140.92]  mew asks is lmg becoming a creator university you get paid to be at i don't i don't i don't know i
[12140.92 --> 12144.44]  mean we've talked about the worst thing we've talked about this a fair bit lately right like
[12144.44 --> 12152.28]  what is my legacy yeah because if that happens but we get you know if company hat firmly on if we get
[12152.28 --> 12158.68]  good value out of them while they're here yeah and then if they fly free yeah why shouldn't we be
[12158.68 --> 12165.96]  happy about leave companies we have existed for so long at this point yeah 13 years and like if we
[12165.96 --> 12172.92]  want to keep existing for say that amount of time longer people are going to continue to leave that's
[12172.92 --> 12179.72]  what it is a fact of having companies basically there are some people as well that like they just have
[12179.72 --> 12184.12]  it in their veins that they're going to be running their own thing they're going to be an entrepreneur
[12184.12 --> 12188.44]  at some point just born to be an entrepreneur that's fine that's good we want them here sure
[12188.44 --> 12193.80]  if they want to be here for a while have some have some drive grow they tend to be motivated people
[12193.80 --> 12198.12]  you're probably going to be here for at least a few years they tend to be innovators we will have
[12198.12 --> 12205.48]  definitely gained thing as a gained things as a company from you in that time uh and then you can
[12205.48 --> 12211.32]  fly free if you want and look i'm not necessarily stay forever i'm not necessarily you know looking
[12211.32 --> 12217.16]  for suggestions for people for us to work with we we make a good faith effort to part on good terms
[12217.16 --> 12224.68]  with everybody that doesn't necessarily mean that we succeed every time um you know and and a door is
[12224.68 --> 12234.52]  never completely shut almost never completely shut um but we're definitely going to make the call
[12234.52 --> 12240.44]  in terms of you know who we are interested in partnering with right because you look at the way that
[12240.44 --> 12246.04]  we choose our sponsors it's going to be the same kind of thing we're going to just like we partner with
[12246.04 --> 12251.64]  sponsors who we believe have strong character and we hold them accountable in the same way the people
[12251.64 --> 12256.20]  that we're going to partner with in terms of sponsorships we're going to be we're going to be
[12256.20 --> 12261.56]  selective and that applies across the board you know whether someone's a former employee or whether
[12261.56 --> 12267.56]  someone isn't um you can expect to see in general a lot more creator sponsorships coming from us in the
[12267.56 --> 12274.52]  in the coming months and i'm actually super stoked about it it's um it's pretty cool to kind of go full circle
[12274.52 --> 12282.36]  from being the the sponsor e to the sponsor it's weird it's it's super weird it's very weird it's
[12282.36 --> 12290.36]  weird looking at a video from the other end if that makes sense yeah uh and like and like i don't have
[12290.36 --> 12297.40]  to do the negotiations on this stuff myself right but like obviously you know for me to to kind of just
[12297.96 --> 12303.24]  throw the money out there and hope that the end product you know and my team is you know making sure
[12303.24 --> 12308.84]  that everything goes smoothly and and their link is correct like little stupid things that we know
[12308.84 --> 12312.92]  we have to deal with on our side and just kind of seeing it from the from the brand side it's
[12313.72 --> 12317.88]  it's really weird yeah i was trying to scroll through his video to find the sponsorship on my
[12317.88 --> 12323.40]  own laptop and i and i found it and i want to watch this with sound because his intro into it looks
[12323.40 --> 12330.52]  funny but um this is extremely unrelated but he talks about assetto corsa um
[12332.44 --> 12338.36]  so of course yeah they have a new game that's in early access right now
[12339.72 --> 12347.80]  called assetto corsa rally that i'm like really hyped for have you played it at all i haven't i gotta get
[12347.80 --> 12354.76]  my sim rig set up you have to tell me how this is yeah because i used to love the dirt games i
[12354.76 --> 12360.60]  when's the last dirt that came out well i mean i'm a dirt one stan second one was kind of not as good
[12360.60 --> 12368.68]  in my eyes but having it in in an assetto corsa engine is going to be amazing i am very very excited
[12369.96 --> 12374.12]  there's i read the reviews there was some comments on it like you know they don't have the physics
[12374.12 --> 12378.52]  dialed yet and stuff like that so i'm interested in hearing what you have to say and this is what
[12379.08 --> 12384.12]  i use vr for all the time that's why i kind of like that high-end tethered experience like dude
[12384.12 --> 12387.96]  this this is what i meant when i was like i don't know that i'm really going to regret buying the big
[12387.96 --> 12392.20]  screen beyond probably because if i can wear the big screen beyond to play this that's what i want it
[12392.20 --> 12400.44]  for you know the the the heavy index does get kind of like irritating when you're rapidly shoulder
[12400.44 --> 12407.00]  checking um right yeah right because i do some eye racing on the side too and like you're you're
[12407.00 --> 12411.56]  basically like sitting there whipping your head about for three four hours straight sometimes and it
[12411.56 --> 12422.12]  gets exhausting yeah sorry i know that was quite the gear shift um but i'm very i'm very hyped for
[12422.12 --> 12427.64]  that game i was going to steam to look for the official page for the new hardware they're launching
[12427.64 --> 12434.12]  and that came up first for me and i was like oh nice anyways yeah it's exciting i like the idea
[12434.12 --> 12439.40]  i gotta check that out yes yes i haven't had a functional computer in a well desktop in a very
[12439.40 --> 12446.44]  long time so who knows but um it's it's cool i like the idea of working with creators that have
[12446.44 --> 12451.72]  worked here in the past i like the idea of fostering those relationships i like this concept that like if
[12451.72 --> 12457.08]  we last for a long time we might end up building our own kind of like ecosystem of creators around here
[12457.08 --> 12463.16]  i don't know if our own is fair enough to say but like we could end up contributing towards uh an
[12463.16 --> 12469.64]  ecosystem of creators around here because you know like there's many but there aren't like a ton in our
[12469.64 --> 12479.80]  space at least creators in the tech technology c area um so just like effectively kind of contributing towards
[12479.80 --> 12486.68]  that being more of a thing would be pretty cool canada tech creator valley sure sweet it sounds
[12486.68 --> 12494.92]  awesome to me yeah i don't need a new computer uh it's my my apartment is effectively non-functional
[12494.92 --> 12502.12]  meaning my computer is like put away right now all right i think it's time for land show after dark
[12502.12 --> 12506.20]  are we done all the topics did we do it we're done we did it all right
[12509.80 --> 12524.68]  heck yeah let's go what oh i just thought you might read a merch message i was making it
[12524.68 --> 12528.92]  getting horrible he's doing work oh i thought i curated this one
[12530.12 --> 12536.76]  uh the one thing i couldn't get out of linus t was i couldn't get him to say i'd like to interject for a
[12536.76 --> 12546.92]  moment he didn't like he didn't think it was funny i was like okay well actually i wasn't like okay i
[12546.92 --> 12552.60]  tried really hard i think i overheard some of that yeah i was getting more and more upset for you
[12553.72 --> 12561.00]  no yes it was stallman but that's exactly what's funny about it it's stallman was it the point is i
[12561.00 --> 12565.24]  well i tried to get him to do i was going to refer to him i was going to refer to myself as
[12565.96 --> 12569.56]  linus and i wanted him to say i'd like to interject for a moment what you're referring to as linus is
[12569.56 --> 12576.04]  in fact linux linus uh or as i've taken to calling it but like he was just like i don't think it's
[12576.04 --> 12581.24]  funny i'm like okay i see what you're going to understand him not thinking that's funny yeah
[12582.20 --> 12587.88]  i thought it was very funny though yeah so i tried i tried i i almost died on that hill sure fortunately he
[12587.88 --> 12594.28]  didn't just pack his bags and leave yeah this is not worth actually dying on but i i can definitely
[12594.28 --> 12599.40]  appreciate an effort sammy me by like not getting the reference i was like no no people will get the
[12599.40 --> 12604.28]  reference it'll be really funny and i was like sammy sammy you're dialed in would have gotten it
[12604.28 --> 12610.28]  to like internet but he like didn't know i'd like to interject for a moment sammy's dialed into brain rot
[12610.28 --> 12620.60]  oh it's not the terrible thing yeah yeah yeah it completely me on that one okay buying the computer
[12620.60 --> 12627.48]  the commuter bag for my wife a soon-to-be doctor of physical therapy this would be a good professional
[12627.48 --> 12633.56]  backpack nice do either of you have any funny or interesting stories about physical therapists
[12633.56 --> 12638.28]  physical therapy humor dan what are you even trying to do right now i don't know curate this
[12638.28 --> 12645.56]  you have elbow i when i was having crazy knee problems sure okay funny i tried to solve it through
[12645.56 --> 12651.32]  physical therapy i ended up solving it with youtube videos which is strange but okay i went to multiple
[12651.32 --> 12659.48]  physiotherapists at first one of them wanted to do uh needles but it was like little ones yeah needles
[12659.48 --> 12663.64]  people always correct me on because there's like big ones and little ones and people i say
[12663.64 --> 12668.04]  acupuncture or whatever the other one is and they correct me whatever it was little needles they're
[12668.04 --> 12674.12]  putting them in my quad and she ended up like sending me away as a client like oh i will not do this with
[12674.12 --> 12678.28]  you anymore i can maybe do other things with you but we will not do this because she'd put them in my
[12678.28 --> 12684.60]  quad and then my quad would go and bend them all right so you were breaking all her needles yeah nice
[12684.60 --> 12691.24]  okay that's pretty funny all right that's the best i got didn't they also tell you that you were
[12691.24 --> 12696.68]  weird as as all hell like very strange client because you actually did the exercises as we were assigned
[12696.68 --> 12703.00]  yeah yeah my current physiotherapist said that basically i had a i don't know what it was
[12703.00 --> 12707.24]  i had problems with my thumbs i screwed up both of my thumbs which was kind of weird and he gave me a
[12707.24 --> 12711.96]  bunch of like little hand push-ups and like all these other weird things and then i came back to him
[12711.96 --> 12717.80]  and was like we're good let's work on something else but like the thumbs are good and he was like
[12719.16 --> 12725.72]  what which was great that's cool all right well i have nothing for funny physical therapy stories
[12725.72 --> 12733.72]  but i do have some validation um of that merch message that the commuter bag is awesome i got this
[12733.72 --> 12740.92]  from the head robot at dbrand a few minutes ago um got the cw holiday care package genuinely so good
[12740.92 --> 12748.52]  thanks team loved it i'm gonna out him here i'm gonna do it kept the commuter bag for myself
[12749.56 --> 12751.88]  tossing my peak design oh
[12755.48 --> 12757.08]  usually companies don't name other companies
[12759.16 --> 12767.56]  leaked the dm sammy did it to me today seems fair yep seems fair seems fair you know what that is
[12767.56 --> 12774.44]  actually like a killer endorsement because you know you know what the head robot is like in terms
[12774.44 --> 12780.28]  of attention to detail and quality and appearance i'm sure and you've seen how expensive the head
[12780.28 --> 12787.88]  robots stickers are so surely the head robot could afford any backpack that he or she desired yeah yeah
[12787.88 --> 12789.40]  yeah yeah so with all of that in mind
[12793.56 --> 12799.00]  okay what's next pretty good cue for luke if you had a nickel for every time you missed out on a gigantic
[12799.00 --> 12806.84]  linux related event you'd have two nickels which one hurts more this one what was the first one
[12806.84 --> 12813.88]  i don't even know what could even compare to this that's this is the one to end all ones i'm sure i
[12813.88 --> 12821.80]  could search my brain vault and find it uh i vaguely have a memory of that being a thing but there's too
[12821.80 --> 12829.56]  much recency damage um that i can't i can't even i think the term is recency bias no just damage
[12829.56 --> 12837.80]  sorry dude vance is nothing if he's not efficient
[12840.52 --> 12845.96]  up next hi overly charismatic man dan and chicken in sauce pan
[12848.36 --> 12854.04]  these are getting very creative you've heard of price to performance now you're hearing of
[12854.04 --> 12862.52]  size to annoyance what is the small what is the smallest thing
[12865.40 --> 12868.12]  linus excluded that bothers you most
[12872.44 --> 12878.68]  all right i like it that's a good question that's a quality merch message because it's linus excluded um
[12878.68 --> 12884.12]  i'm gonna go no i i mean if i was the smallest thing that annoyed you the most it would be good for me to know
[12887.16 --> 12895.72]  i'm gonna go with eating sounds that is actually my barometer for if i'm in a bad mood because sometimes
[12895.72 --> 12905.00]  i can't tell but if someone is chewing a little bit next to me and they don't have their mouth open or
[12905.00 --> 12911.16]  anything but i can just hear eating noises i get a bit of misophonia i don't love eating noises at the
[12911.16 --> 12918.20]  best of times um like my my stepdad oh used to drive me nuts because he would he would eat cereal with
[12918.20 --> 12924.84]  his mouth open and to be clear my stepdad is the best stepdad that ever walked the face of the earth
[12924.84 --> 12930.68]  he's pretty great i was never treated any differently from his own blood children and that is something that
[12930.68 --> 12941.72]  is maybe not completely unique but it is pretty darn special for a step parent to have to for for me to
[12941.72 --> 12948.92]  go through i don't know how many like i don't know how many years i lived with them or even before i lived
[12948.92 --> 12957.40]  with them like the second he married my mom i was his kid i was his son and i called him dad
[12957.40 --> 12962.68]  dad call my dad dad too but whatever dad dad two dads turns out it doesn't up that much
[12965.32 --> 12966.84]  it's obviously different context
[12975.08 --> 12975.80]  the point is
[12975.80 --> 12982.84]  we have a literal button on the show
[12986.60 --> 12992.84]  the point is he wasn't much of a quiet eater um and so it's i've always known that it's something
[12992.84 --> 12999.80]  that kind of like bothered me but i've i've outgrown it i've like mostly gotten over it except when i'm
[12999.80 --> 13006.60]  low blood sugar or i haven't had enough sleep or usually both i'll be like i'll realize i'm like
[13007.48 --> 13014.04]  holding something kind of tight and yvonne's just like sitting there like eating something i'll be
[13014.04 --> 13021.88]  like okay i need to deal with this because i am about to like slap the food out of her hand
[13022.92 --> 13028.92]  if if i don't deal with my mood right now so that i'd say that's mine i've had the the eating noises
[13028.92 --> 13037.16]  thing as well but i think a more recent so like current one and i it feels almost irrational well
[13037.16 --> 13042.28]  that's the thing but i mean that's basically what we're being asked right it drives me insane when
[13042.28 --> 13050.44]  someone is there there are forms of it that are okay but it's like when it's quiet enough that you're
[13050.44 --> 13057.00]  doing this or yeah this um but if you if you're playing stuff on your phone on speakers in public
[13057.00 --> 13062.36]  oh i mean that's just that's not even a small thing but this has been confusing to me that's a big
[13062.36 --> 13068.04]  thing it's been confusing me because like i was waiting at a train station recently and someone was
[13068.04 --> 13073.40]  playing music out of a bluetooth speaker attached to their backpack just walking around yeah and it
[13073.40 --> 13080.36]  drove me nuts no that person's just a f***ing ass but then somebody drove by somebody drove by in a car
[13080.36 --> 13087.72]  that had fairly loud music that didn't bother me that's interesting because that i thought was
[13087.72 --> 13093.40]  weird they both bother me equally they don't bother me equally okay let's go in between what about
[13093.40 --> 13097.88]  someone with their bluetooth speaker hanging off of their cycle their bike their bicycle that's the
[13097.88 --> 13101.72]  word i was looking for i feel like that would bother me because i feel like i i was trying to unpack
[13101.72 --> 13106.28]  this and i don't know for the cycle it'd be interesting to like have it happen and then try to evaluate but
[13106.28 --> 13112.84]  yeah okay the car one to me is it's like it's theoretically their space and it's leaking out
[13112.84 --> 13117.88]  of their space yeah but they very clearly don't need it to be that loud in their space they're
[13117.88 --> 13123.16]  literally damaging their hearing and they're making it your problem that's true i also wonder like if
[13123.16 --> 13129.16]  their window was open would that change for me or not i'm not sure i don't know okay what if they were
[13129.16 --> 13135.08]  in their own house but their music was so loud that you could hear it inside your own house this is an
[13135.08 --> 13143.72]  interesting one as a condo dweller this is the thing that happens and i generally try to respect it
[13145.32 --> 13150.76]  because i'm like you know what we're all stuck in this big thing together what if it was detached homes
[13152.04 --> 13159.00]  and you could still you could hear their music clearly i feel like if it was a event or a movie nope
[13159.00 --> 13166.28]  it's just always like every day that's pretty annoying yeah we actually then it might change
[13166.28 --> 13174.60]  if this is a garage band nope okay we had to go confront this hole back when we were uh when brian
[13174.60 --> 13181.00]  the electrician and i were filming the uh installing ac in my attic thing because it was so loud we couldn't
[13181.00 --> 13189.00]  film from uh from a house away um and i actually i probably still have audio of the interaction
[13189.00 --> 13196.20]  somewhere but basically like this guy was the biggest piece of garbage ever like as we walked up to the
[13196.20 --> 13203.08]  door the like two-year-old two to three-year-old was about to come bolting out and i like like there's a
[13203.08 --> 13209.72]  road and i like stopped him and the first thing he says to me is don't touch my son and i'm like bro i
[13209.72 --> 13217.32]  wouldn't need to if you weren't an utter delinquent um what a way to start a conversation
[13218.84 --> 13224.04]  i'm not saying what you said is that i just the whole scenario and dude this house was so
[13224.04 --> 13229.08]  loud like when the door was opened we're talking hearing damage for that kid like
[13229.96 --> 13234.84]  crazy and he's like i have to have it like this i'm a dj i'm like you what so you're the world's first
[13234.84 --> 13239.48]  dj that hasn't heard of a pair of headphones you gotta be kidding me right they literally have
[13239.48 --> 13245.32]  headphones designed i mean this guy's a piece of work these actually like do it you can turn the
[13245.32 --> 13253.88]  cup wild wow wild i i don't i don't think i've had much of a dumber conversation with any like
[13253.88 --> 13262.60]  otherwise seemingly coherent functional human being also like man you are not recreating the speaker
[13262.60 --> 13269.24]  set up at the club with your home thing if you can get if if you i actually don't know this because
[13269.24 --> 13275.64]  i'm i don't partake but if you can get high from secondhand marijuana smoke that kid was probably high
[13275.64 --> 13286.44]  like it was intense you can oh okay well there you go man brutal brutal neighbor i think it has a
[13286.44 --> 13291.40]  name i think it's called contact high i'm sure someone in full point chat will correct
[13292.60 --> 13300.76]  no okay yes something like that yeah i feel really bad for the kid too
[13303.24 --> 13308.20]  like i can't feel bad for an adult that is just like an idiot and harms themself i just don't really
[13308.20 --> 13313.32]  care that's that they're an adult and they they have agency contact high is psycho
[13314.52 --> 13320.44]  psycho somatic oh apparently it's fake huh you just think you're high never mind then i don't know
[13320.44 --> 13326.92]  then rick says we used to call it hot boxing yes it's a contact high well apparently there is some
[13326.92 --> 13330.76]  there is some disagreement about that
[13330.76 --> 13335.32]  i'm gonna consult the sans
[13337.72 --> 13340.68]  the sans say yes what's the sans
[13341.24 --> 13348.36]  ai ai you gotta be kidding me okay let's move on this guy i was doing it as a joke uh i know i know
[13349.48 --> 13354.44]  ah they said washroom i was looking for this one i tried bathroom restroom all that sort of stuff
[13354.44 --> 13359.72]  question for luke while linus is in the washroom probably gen ai is being compared to the industrial
[13359.72 --> 13366.44]  revolution short-term disruption with long-term benefits how much carnage until the good part so
[13366.44 --> 13367.16]  tell me something
[13369.72 --> 13371.08]  the industrial revolution
[13373.96 --> 13382.20]  benefit yes but to everyone no or was the benefit
[13382.20 --> 13384.44]  benefit massively
[13385.48 --> 13393.72]  inequal and is it in fact worse for people who are on the lower rungs of the social ladder
[13394.44 --> 13395.72]  than things were before
[13398.12 --> 13403.72]  i'm talking like you're sifting through you know the shipped off
[13404.92 --> 13410.44]  you know cadmium infested remains of technology in
[13412.20 --> 13418.04]  some place where they're literally just like burning this stuff to get to the precious metals that are in it
[13418.60 --> 13418.84]  like
[13420.36 --> 13420.68]  um
[13421.72 --> 13428.28]  the industrial revolution was highly beneficial to the owner class in the developed world i'm not
[13428.28 --> 13433.56]  convinced that it was necessarily beneficial to every human being on earth it's interesting because like
[13434.28 --> 13439.48]  you could argue a lot of medicines and stuff wouldn't have been possible really without
[13439.48 --> 13445.16]  more advanced technologies that came from things like the industrial revolution 100 and those
[13445.16 --> 13448.44]  benefited people but they sure as heck didn't benefit anyone who's not
[13448.44 --> 13451.16]  disproportionately benefit getting access to what you described
[13452.28 --> 13455.88]  yeah yeah yeah interesting uh to more directly address
[13456.52 --> 13459.08]  oh no i wasn't done okay keep going gen ai
[13460.20 --> 13463.32]  same thing i think that's what we're going to see i think we're going to see
[13463.32 --> 13470.52]  short-term disruption to in equally to people and i think we're going to see long-term benefits
[13471.24 --> 13473.32]  very in equally to
[13476.20 --> 13482.52]  i'd even wager even more and equally possibly i also think it has an interesting effect um
[13483.56 --> 13490.44]  wendell wendell shared me a meme recently that i couldn't agree with more um not not directly you
[13490.44 --> 13498.28]  know whatever it's still a meme but um if it would load what discord hello uh anyways it was
[13498.28 --> 13507.08]  something along the lines of like if if the world realized how fast um like local ai is getting
[13507.08 --> 13513.48]  extremely good here it is yeah it's it's a a tweet apparently uh if people understood how good local
[13513.48 --> 13519.16]  lms are getting the stock market would crash tomorrow um and it was a response to a tweet that said
[13519.16 --> 13523.40]  anthropic doesn't want you to know but you can self-host llm like quen and use it in clod code
[13523.40 --> 13532.44]  for free um there is an interesting side effect of this where the beneficial part for some people
[13532.44 --> 13538.20]  is happening now it's less applicable to some and it's highly applicable to other others locally hosting
[13538.20 --> 13546.28]  this stuff is expensive and not the easiest thing for everyone to do um but you can also gain access
[13546.28 --> 13551.32]  non-locally hosted that was just kind of an aside for actually quite cheap and in a lot of cases
[13551.32 --> 13555.88]  completely free and it's enabling this like i i don't remember who was talking about it but
[13556.44 --> 13565.80]  it's there are some comparisons you can make to renaissance knowledge education speed of learning
[13565.80 --> 13572.76]  and ability to jump into something from nowhere and get to a fairly uh competent point has like never
[13572.76 --> 13579.32]  really been easier flip side speed of misinformation and disinformation for sure like there are i'm not
[13579.32 --> 13583.72]  i'm not trying to hide that there are extreme negatives right i'm saying that in some cases there
[13583.72 --> 13591.72]  are there are the ability for one person to leverage themselves very highly i don't think has ever quite
[13591.72 --> 13597.08]  been at this level before no which is i agree which is very very interesting and some people are
[13597.08 --> 13604.12]  already turning that into like highly positive beneficial situations overall what we're doing is
[13606.44 --> 13612.36]  enabling the surveillance of extreme garbage and slop massive amounts of surveillance state because
[13612.36 --> 13617.48]  self-hosting is so expensive that you're probably doing it through some other system which is harvesting
[13617.48 --> 13622.12]  every single thing you've ever typed into it building profiles on you like we've never seen before
[13622.12 --> 13632.04]  like only wet dreams of early google um like there's there is so much bad but in almost everything
[13632.04 --> 13637.48]  especially this complicated there is diamonds in the rough and there are people that are utilizing
[13637.48 --> 13646.04]  this stuff to extremely beneficial personal and i mean small small person degrees social mobility is i guess
[13646.04 --> 13651.56]  what you're trying to massive amounts of it for specific people who can think of a way to leverage it
[13651.56 --> 13657.32]  yeah for themselves positively but that doesn't change what i said about the benefit being highly
[13657.32 --> 13661.72]  inequal and all knowing socks says even homeless people have super computers in their pockets the
[13661.72 --> 13666.84]  industrial revolution came with new problems but was overall beneficial but i think you're missing part
[13666.84 --> 13675.40]  of what i was saying and yeah a homeless person in the usa is probably in a better position than that same
[13675.40 --> 13687.40]  homeless person in southeast asia or india oh well yeah um and like the usa is actually a very small portion of
[13687.40 --> 13695.48]  the global population like i don't know that um i don't know that he literally did divide it up by like
[13695.48 --> 13703.24]  countries yeah people in western countries i don't think necessarily always remember how uh in the minority we are
[13703.24 --> 13716.04]  in general um yeah it's going to be a rough uh and frankly all of this i mean we gotta keep in mind
[13716.84 --> 13722.60]  all of this is coming from the perspective of someone who is much less likely to be harmed by any of this
[13722.60 --> 13735.80]  um oh yeah uh yeah like we're we're gonna be fine we're in a position to leverage ai leverage this revolution
[13736.60 --> 13740.52]  um invest capital and benefit from it like it's uh
[13742.68 --> 13748.20]  um like when i say this is bad i don't mean bad for me i just i mean bad like generally
[13748.20 --> 13750.60]  it's yikes
[13752.76 --> 13757.88]  mule jin which i hope i said correctly said dude the p did i just lose audio did you just unplug
[13757.88 --> 13763.64]  i'm sorry i'm just fidgeting uh said dude the people in chile that sort ores and chemical baths
[13763.64 --> 13769.24]  for like 20 cents a day it's absolutely crazy yeah they are not better off than they would have been
[13769.24 --> 13774.20]  in like a more agricultural society 200 years ago i i pretty much promise you that
[13774.20 --> 13780.68]  yeah it's weird but yeah there are it man i'm sorry
[13783.00 --> 13788.12]  is it working there we go and like the uncontacted people in south america that are getting like
[13788.12 --> 13795.80]  mercury poison from illegal gold mines they're not better off that makes sense yeah but i i i mean it's
[13795.80 --> 13801.72]  i think it's important to see both ends of it at the same time and hold both sides of it in your in
[13801.72 --> 13808.28]  your mind i think you need to to like have a more accurate perspective on it i guess i think you need
[13808.28 --> 13814.36]  to recognize the good sides and recognize the bad sides um there are absolutely ways that it has helped
[13814.36 --> 13821.24]  i think the the modern renaissance version of it is something that shouldn't be ignored even while you
[13821.24 --> 13827.96]  can hold and understand the concepts of the negatives that it is also creating um and i mean bots makes
[13827.96 --> 13832.28]  a good point you know scholarly papers i've seen on global food security show it's way better globally
[13832.28 --> 13838.12]  than before the industrial revolution as is medicine and that's fine but that doesn't change that
[13839.08 --> 13848.92]  a generally good thing can still be worse for some people and that was the entire point was that this is not
[13849.72 --> 13857.24]  a universal benefit yeah like the industrial revolution this is not going to universally elevate people there
[13857.24 --> 13861.80]  are people's lives who will be worse for it um there are also people's lives who will be better for it
[13861.80 --> 13871.00]  and some who where it will be much better but it does seem like this one this one steers even farther
[13871.64 --> 13878.20]  toward benefiting the haves at the expense of the have-nots and the surveillance one is a huge one that we
[13878.20 --> 13886.68]  didn't touch on too much but is a major element of this i i don't know that in another 30 40 50 years with
[13887.24 --> 13896.04]  autonomous autonomous autonomous tools for population management and cameras everywhere i don't know that
[13896.04 --> 13896.60]  um
[13896.60 --> 13903.48]  i don't know that peasant uprisings will still be possible
[13906.52 --> 13913.16]  i don't know that you'll still be able to overthrow a corrupt dictator i don't know that it will be
[13913.16 --> 13919.40]  possible anymore something makes me want to push forward the indomitable human spirit i feel like
[13919.40 --> 13925.88]  we'd find a way but i understand what you're saying i hope so i still have that hope there's a lot there's
[13925.88 --> 13930.20]  a lot of you know the gen z uprisings and stuff there's a lot of crazy stuff going on right now yeah
[13930.76 --> 13938.84]  big and in a lot of ways good but there's no there's no army of you know impervious you know robot
[13938.84 --> 13945.56]  dogs with ai true controlled turrets on them hacker bros dude hacker bros let's hope for the best
[13948.28 --> 13951.56]  hacker bros are goaded but like how are the north koreans doing even now
[13953.48 --> 13955.56]  but that but that has nothing to do
[13958.68 --> 13964.20]  i mean they're definitely using population management tools yeah guarantee you they're using ai yeah
[13964.20 --> 13972.36]  it's 100 the wealthy pitting us lessers against each other yeah i mean for sure well it's the
[13972.36 --> 13975.40]  cookie thing there are few truer memes than the cookie meme
[13978.84 --> 13986.60]  big time how is that not the first cookie meme google are you trying to hide this from me
[13986.60 --> 13995.16]  i could i could see cookie monster stuff being shared oh wow yeah but still how far do i have
[13995.16 --> 13997.24]  to go for this surprise it hasn't shown up yet
[14001.40 --> 14003.72]  there we go top top left
[14009.00 --> 14013.96]  i don't know what it says but this is the meme yeah it's basically this yeah
[14016.60 --> 14020.12]  yeah yeah
[14024.52 --> 14032.84]  uh but anyways yeah it's you know if you can afford i'm once i get my stupid condo to livable again um
[14033.48 --> 14040.12]  i'm planning on trying to figure out local hosting in a big way for a for a wide variety of things um
[14040.12 --> 14049.32]  but including local lm and ai services i don't really want to use public ones much moving forward
[14049.96 --> 14057.88]  um i want to shift to that uh largely inspired by wendell i was already planning on it but largely
[14057.88 --> 14066.28]  inspired by wendell um and i would highly encourage all of you to explore it um i understand it can be
[14066.28 --> 14070.84]  expensive there are also much cheaper ways to approach it used hardware is obviously a good
[14070.84 --> 14078.76]  way to go um the the the mac stuff is very very interesting and if you can't jump in now there's
[14078.76 --> 14086.04]  always the possibility that these these big data centers will be updating cards eventually um and what
[14086.04 --> 14093.24]  you can run now on that level of hardware will be runnable in the future on that level of hardware
[14093.24 --> 14100.84]  so you might be behind but you'd have at least what we currently have today um at your at your usage
[14102.92 --> 14109.40]  um there was a a pretty good little chat message here coordinated carry asks can you name one change
[14109.40 --> 14114.68]  with truly universal benefit i'm gonna go with open source
[14120.36 --> 14121.80]  anyone harmed had it coming
[14125.64 --> 14130.52]  i just got kind of i've got mr torvalds on the mind i can i can counter that okay counter that hit me
[14130.52 --> 14135.96]  because there's been malware distributed through open source stuff there has been there's been ways
[14135.96 --> 14143.00]  that was open source that i don't think but it enabled it it enabled it but net did it make the
[14143.00 --> 14149.32]  life of that person who was infected with malware worse oh that's that's pretty because overall it
[14149.32 --> 14154.76]  contributed so much positive to their life too i have to look through some of the some of the cases
[14154.76 --> 14161.80]  of open source is a pretty good one um open source or source available
[14161.80 --> 14169.32]  that is a good question walker 161 penicillin yeah penicillin was pretty dope well where's not
[14169.32 --> 14174.44]  exclusive open source never said it was yeah not even a little bit didn't even sort of say that
[14175.00 --> 14181.56]  i do indeed like both hot dogs and hamburgers all right insulin uh yeah insulin was pretty
[14181.56 --> 14184.44]  that's a pretty good argument that was us wasn't it yeah canadian innovation let's go
[14185.24 --> 14187.48]  you're welcome base base base base
[14187.48 --> 14195.08]  did he sell it for a dollar something like that based absolutely based based and yet somehow it
[14195.08 --> 14201.32]  still costs a lot of money in some places ridiculous yeah in spite of our industrial
[14201.32 --> 14208.92]  medicine uh okay carry on dan hey big l remember when the internet tried spotting your face in computer
[14208.92 --> 14216.04]  case reflections back when slick pc kept things secret was it all fun or did it ever feel like stalking or
[14216.04 --> 14221.16]  doxing it's kind of hard to even remember it about i thought it was pretty fun i think i thought it was fun
[14221.16 --> 14225.48]  yeah i'm pretty sure we both thought it was pretty fun i think so it's genuinely been
[14226.12 --> 14228.92]  i was talking about this the other day it's been almost half my life
[14230.12 --> 14234.68]  because the whole thing was stupid and didn't matter like the only reason for the the secrecy was
[14234.68 --> 14243.96]  because the original ncix cameraman didn't and still doesn't want his name out there and so it started
[14243.96 --> 14249.00]  with calling him the cameraman because he didn't want his name used and then i was like well this
[14249.00 --> 14253.72]  has become kind of a shtick for the channel so now it's just a thing so you need a nickname because it's
[14253.72 --> 14259.72]  linus and nickname person who's off camera and then but it didn't it never mattered it wasn't like luke
[14259.72 --> 14265.96]  asking it it wasn't like the cameraman where luke cared so it was just for the memes i also didn't
[14266.76 --> 14273.16]  care that i was being hidden either like i just didn't care it got kind of dumb eventually but
[14273.16 --> 14279.48]  eventually then we changed it yeah and then it was fine it just didn't really matter that much in
[14279.48 --> 14283.96]  either direction until it got dumb hey thanks for your purchase
[14287.56 --> 14293.72]  hi dlo in retrospect do you have components of floatplane labs or other development projects you wish
[14293.72 --> 14299.80]  you had gone with a commercial product rather than developing on your own thanks for the merch one
[14299.80 --> 14304.60]  of the one of the problems so i can i can point at a bunch of stuff on floatplane and be like yeah but
[14304.60 --> 14310.12]  one of the problems was a lot of them didn't exist at the time or they might have existed but their
[14310.12 --> 14316.84]  continued existence was very questionable to the point where we even picked something that we went with
[14316.84 --> 14323.56]  that uh still technically exist but like not really and we're somewhat locked into it so
[14324.20 --> 14329.56]  the existence seemed solid but it was very expensive or that like there was always a reason
[14329.56 --> 14336.76]  for doing things the way that we did yeah it didn't stay reasonable yeah always yeah uh and there's some
[14336.76 --> 14341.96]  stuff that we will still probably pivot off eventually there's some stuff that we already have
[14341.96 --> 14347.88]  um and and that'll keep changing over time but like i think the initial decisions made along the
[14347.88 --> 14353.00]  path were were very reasonable considering the knowledge we had at the time i understand that's
[14353.00 --> 14358.20]  not the question that you're asking um you're saying in retrospect uh but yeah at the time the
[14358.20 --> 14363.88]  decisions were made there was usually not an option that made more sense um if we could have snapped
[14363.88 --> 14367.80]  our fingers and known that certain systems were going to remain or that certain systems would have had
[14367.80 --> 14374.36]  uh very effective price decreases or whatever there's a couple changes uh it would be pretty sick to
[14375.08 --> 14379.32]  actually i mean it's been pretty good for a while now but we went through a lot of trials and
[14379.32 --> 14387.00]  tribulations with transcoding um our current system is pretty dope transcoding all the backlogs for the
[14387.80 --> 14396.68]  the uh sauce plus stuff while also transcoding like jeff geerling's backlog upload all at kind of like the same
[14396.68 --> 14404.12]  time and no one noticed and it was like really fast and very parallelized was sick it was very cool to
[14404.12 --> 14411.48]  like do that sort of on our own we talked about this uh i think last week but we have auto generated um
[14411.48 --> 14419.08]  ai generated uh closed captions yep on uh automatic or automatic ones on float plane now we're doing the
[14419.08 --> 14425.48]  compute on that that is whisper oh sorry yes yeah but we're not we are doing the it's running like on our
[14425.48 --> 14434.52]  stuff yeah and like that's cool yes i like i like do it's yeah anyways so yeah i i don't know uh for the
[14434.52 --> 14441.48]  lab uh what what exactly was the question was there something well you weren't involved in a lot of the
[14441.48 --> 14446.44]  early decisions so i wouldn't so i'm sure he'd do it differently but that doesn't necessarily mean that
[14447.40 --> 14453.32]  um luke sort of made a mistake or whatever or even that it was a mistake it's just everyone has a
[14453.32 --> 14462.36]  different philosophy yeah all right dan hit me hi lld i got to go to ibm's future of tape event and
[14462.36 --> 14470.84]  jesus tape well wow and see their development eight track but no tape is we're doing nine
[14470.84 --> 14478.76]  tape is legit i know don't make fun of tape man and see their development uh lab for physical and virtual
[14478.76 --> 14485.56]  tape virtual tape hard drives yeah insanely cool it's virtual tape would enterprise tape be interesting
[14485.56 --> 14493.24]  enough for an ltd video i have a guy we've done some videos on tape i don't know what more there would
[14493.24 --> 14503.72]  be to say other than yep here's the new generation tape and um it's more denser so we did we did this a
[14503.72 --> 14513.88]  number oh my god that was seven years ago we got a 5500 tape drive and um you look so baby i know right
[14513.88 --> 14520.68]  and and this is it it's thunderbolt go figure and i think we still have it somewhere um
[14522.36 --> 14528.84]  i i don't know that it's changed enough that i would have anything new to say about it in the last seven
[14528.84 --> 14534.84]  years it's it's it's faster and more denser but if i'm missing something here please let me know okay
[14534.84 --> 14543.40]  virtual tape is interesting actually ibm ts 7700 virtual tape library 4.2 petabytes for high performance
[14543.40 --> 14551.80]  workloads uh looks like that which is sick um the new ibm ts 7780 virtual tape library the latest in the
[14551.80 --> 14557.56]  generation operates at disk or ssd speeds while maintaining and this is the part what made it make
[14557.56 --> 14566.60]  sense compatibility with existing tape operations okay so it's just not tape but it like acts like it
[14566.60 --> 14578.28]  so if you have systems that are expecting tape type operations it will work okay 46 petabytes of capacity
[14578.28 --> 14586.60]  delivered in an easy to use easy to service ibm diamondback tape library that thing no no uh that's
[14586.60 --> 14593.64]  the tape one huh is that not what this is that's the actual tape as well as ibm storage deep archive
[14594.12 --> 14602.84]  ah okay yeah uh all right yeah neat cool i've never once used tape stuff i've always thought it's very
[14602.84 --> 14606.84]  fascinating it's very cool yeah and i've said everything i have to say about it i think nice
[14607.64 --> 14610.44]  at some point i wonder if we should just wipe the channel and start over
[14610.44 --> 14620.60]  no why not but i think you should effectively do that in regards to video creation like just
[14620.60 --> 14628.12]  remake videos i don't think there's a reason to delete your evergreen but i do think it is sometimes
[14628.12 --> 14634.68]  ridiculous to be like we can't make a video on that we've made it before nine years ago as if like
[14634.68 --> 14641.16]  that really matters i don't i don't think that makes sense um my and i i do think we should
[14641.16 --> 14646.12]  recreate videos if they're beyond like a certain time threshold because it's all about the the
[14646.12 --> 14651.64]  notification and stuff right like for for a lot of people they're not going to search up a lot of
[14651.64 --> 14657.56]  these things they're looking for you to tell them and if you don't release a video on it now you have not
[14657.56 --> 14667.56]  told them i think it's totally reasonable i'll think about it hit me dan l and l all the steam news
[14667.56 --> 14675.08]  resurfaced the old wan show episode with the legendary total biscuit as guest headline topic was og steam
[14675.08 --> 14681.16]  controller that brit is still missed what was it like having him on it was fun yeah i i didn't really
[14681.16 --> 14688.36]  know him before that and we didn't really interact much after that and that's um no longer an option
[14688.36 --> 14696.60]  unfortunately um but yeah he was definitely uh definitely a i'd say one of our more outstanding
[14696.60 --> 14703.40]  guests what was it like having him oh it's sorry dyslexia on to out and i was like he didn't come up here
[14703.40 --> 14713.08]  my bad also we're um what looks like 25 videos away from 7 000 that's dumb that's a good time to
[14713.08 --> 14717.40]  quit i think it's big no that's too many it's becoming a funky thing where it's too many dan's
[14717.40 --> 14724.04]  trying to figure out uh api calls and analytics and we want to like call analytics from all of our videos
[14724.60 --> 14730.60]  that's a lot of api calls so we're like smashing into the quota cap and we're talking to youtube be like
[14730.60 --> 14738.52]  okay we have across our channels 13 216 videos oh yeah just pull analytics on that all the time
[14738.52 --> 14747.00]  too many time to quit i i pull every two hours so that's 160 000 api calls a day okay a little
[14747.96 --> 14755.88]  am i allowed to quit once i get to over 9 000 on the ltt channel iso 9001 delete channel then is my
[14755.88 --> 14758.36]  is my power level high enough
[14760.92 --> 14765.80]  i feel you can take a sabbatical i could take a sabbatical and i've earned that at that point
[14765.80 --> 14778.20]  okay i'll keep that in mind hi lgs ll and db how important is digital hygiene for you starting with
[14778.20 --> 14785.48]  deleting old items from download folders and continuing with removing unnecessary test policies as it admins
[14785.48 --> 14793.24]  if it's something i use frequently very important to me like my desktop is clean
[14794.36 --> 14799.08]  i think hold on let me check you probably just don't show it right desktop hide
[14799.08 --> 14807.32]  no you do show it oh no it's nasty it's not clean okay that's not nasty i've seen a lot worse yeah i
[14807.32 --> 14812.36]  have look at that i have like icons there and they're not even like it is less than what i would
[14812.36 --> 14817.56]  have expected from you uh you know what i haven't been using this laptop for that long my desktop at
[14817.56 --> 14823.56]  home though like my my desktop i would expect that to be very immaculate yes um and like
[14824.92 --> 14828.20]  i don't care about my downloads folder because sometimes it can be convenient to grab something
[14828.20 --> 14832.20]  that i downloaded before i also don't care about my downloads folder but it's like one of the only
[14832.20 --> 14839.16]  spots my media folders very clean adhere to standard naming conventions i use filebot i think is
[14839.16 --> 14846.12]  what it's called to like make sure that it's all right and stuff um so yeah it just depends it depends
[14846.12 --> 14852.52]  how often i use it if i don't use it very often like oh my god like i still had my ub key active as
[14852.52 --> 14858.52]  a 2fa even though i hadn't used it in like nine years or something like that until vance finally
[14858.52 --> 14863.88]  removed it like two weeks ago after i was like talking about how ridiculous it was on land show
[14863.88 --> 14869.72]  yubiki bio is really cool someone linked that to me biki bio yeah i'm gonna look at it
[14874.04 --> 14876.84]  i didn't know they did this i think it's pretty sick oh it's expensive
[14878.36 --> 14887.72]  it's cool though it sure is geez it's like 130 bucks each yep well whatever sure fine
[14889.48 --> 14895.56]  yeah bio authenticated cool pretty sick makes sense not surprised they went that
[14895.56 --> 14902.04]  right yeah kind of makes more sense than the other one yeah here's the thing i have and i'm me boom
[14903.56 --> 14913.56]  yeah i like that all right what's up linus last week you said no is lame yes and but is cooler what's the
[14913.56 --> 14918.36]  best no you've given out i don't know um
[14920.76 --> 14927.08]  i would have said christmas album but i finally caved last week no you caved to a new christmas
[14927.08 --> 14932.60]  album you still said no to the old christmas oh yeah that's true no no it doesn't no i didn't
[14932.60 --> 14939.56]  no i didn't he said yes and only if riley does a cooler one and only if that one is only a digital
[14939.56 --> 14946.28]  download yeah okay so yeah i tried to find a way eventually yeah because what have i said no about
[14946.92 --> 14950.36]  i mean what am i a no one
[14950.36 --> 14961.64]  oh yeah you yes anded me on that one but i didn't like it i want to make a labs channel but i have been
[14961.64 --> 14969.88]  told no because i need a content schedule for it and i'm currently refusing to do that oh okay i think
[14969.88 --> 14976.52]  those are both reasonable things i actually didn't say no content schedule for the labs channel is
[14976.52 --> 14983.32]  reasonable i don't know if it makes sense i understand that makes it difficult to sell for
[14984.28 --> 14987.96]  i totally understand and if we don't sell for it it will not make money
[14990.44 --> 14994.36]  my thing is right now we're just making articles which are awesome but we just turn the articles into
[14994.36 --> 15000.28]  videos and no they're not not every article is like ltt quality which is fine and never been the
[15000.28 --> 15005.72]  goal and to be clear we're not saying it's not quality i mean depth sure it's more or clickability
[15005.72 --> 15009.40]  or whatever however you want to call it just i thought quality was not the right word i think
[15009.40 --> 15014.60]  they're really good quality no totally okay quality is incorrect word but we're not going to get a
[15014.60 --> 15022.28]  million views on the 40 watt dynamic power adapter and iphone 17 charging article i think it's sick
[15022.28 --> 15026.84]  though and i actually think a lot more people should know about it because it's a cool it's a cool
[15026.84 --> 15031.64]  it's very cool article the conclusion taught me things i liked it i don't think i'm actually the one
[15031.64 --> 15043.08]  who said no anyway or yes and you might be right i think i think i uh i think i so if you're trying to
[15043.08 --> 15048.84]  do an end around right now i'm not i'm not i'm not getting involved no no no i'm not okay
[15048.84 --> 15055.72]  linustown it's been a while since i asked i think i have asked linustown i'm not saying no i'm saying
[15055.72 --> 15063.24]  it's stupid okay so what's the end the end is i don't have the money for it yet i don't actually
[15063.24 --> 15067.32]  have unlimited money this may surprise you sounds like we're gonna get there given the way that i
[15067.32 --> 15072.84]  behave loans are a thing you know buying fire trucks like how many kidneys do you have you have
[15072.84 --> 15080.68]  children we just we just got to get you to that beyond 9 000 videos and we'll get there i mean i
[15080.68 --> 15084.28]  wouldn't even want to live in the town that's the real problem i don't think it's necessary
[15085.32 --> 15090.28]  that's stupid nope how can i run a cult if i'm not actually there you just need a really really
[15090.28 --> 15097.88]  really tall tower outside of the town how does gaben run steam from a valve sorry from a yacht he
[15097.88 --> 15103.08]  gets it see yeah there's the yes and we get him a yacht yeah but why are we not doing it you're not
[15103.08 --> 15108.20]  giving a proper and you're not playing by your own rules well we just discovered that he would do it
[15108.20 --> 15116.44]  if there was a yacht so now we have the and let's move on okay cultists yes if you will be responsible
[15116.44 --> 15123.16]  for raising the money to purchase the town and i will do nothing but reap benefits from it then yes
[15123.16 --> 15131.00]  linus town approved now he's thinking like a cult leader i like this good job okay up next before
[15131.00 --> 15140.28]  move to taiwan ah that wasn't no that was i don't want to and therefore no that sounds like a pretty
[15140.28 --> 15150.20]  cool no though uproot your entire life no good idea but no i think i think i understand what you're
[15150.20 --> 15155.16]  trying to do with this whole don't say no say yes and thing but it's also like extremely toxic at
[15155.16 --> 15161.96]  certain times i heard back from the head robot uh leaked the dm well earned so we've got i've got
[15161.96 --> 15170.20]  approval that's so cool retroactive approval i know how are they so cool that's in general you want to be
[15170.20 --> 15176.12]  an enabler who enables the people around you that's all i'm trying to get across i know it's not a blanket
[15176.12 --> 15180.60]  rule i understand your point i understand your point thank you but just like when people say
[15180.60 --> 15188.28]  everyone you jump after them because you're like not actually everyone it's the same thing in general
[15188.28 --> 15192.28]  you want to be an enabler not like megan kelly
[15194.84 --> 15202.60]  don't enable that all right well there's a fairly recent controversy i don't know who don't worry about it
[15202.60 --> 15213.32]  do worry about it actually do worry about this uh okay dan hit me sure hey lld linus or slick if
[15213.32 --> 15220.60]  enough floaters that wanted a vr version of floatplane would you do it what would a vr version of floatplane
[15220.60 --> 15228.52]  be wouldn't it just be watching videos in a browser in your vr headset i think you have it already i mean
[15228.52 --> 15231.88]  i played floatplane in the apple vision pro but i think what their meaning is like
[15232.60 --> 15241.64]  uh like 360 video no you can turn your it it's a dead meme yeah it is for sure a dead meme yeah
[15241.64 --> 15247.24]  definitely not enough people want it and we're hey we're doing we're doing what we can to give
[15247.24 --> 15255.72]  people what they do want right now okay we're focused on that all right um okay yeah yeah that's
[15255.72 --> 15262.36]  that's a no actually that's a a no and here's the reasons the reasons are that you care and no one
[15262.36 --> 15268.76]  else and i'm sorry that it has to be like but the question was if enough did you're not being very yes
[15268.76 --> 15274.68]  and right now linus if enough did we do it of course there you go yeah they definitely don't though and
[15274.68 --> 15279.40]  i never will so there's that there's that caveat
[15284.84 --> 15291.96]  uh oh yeah i don't who do you think will be in the nhl play a calgary flames fan atp2 i don't know what any of that means
[15294.44 --> 15299.80]  me neither is that a gambling thing maybe play a no idea is that a thing do they mean playoffs
[15299.80 --> 15310.04]  no idea oh okay well uh up next play alberta play a it's it sounds like it's gambling maybe
[15310.84 --> 15318.60]  disney lucasfilm and muumuu linus did you ever see the live action how to train your dragon
[15318.60 --> 15324.92]  will you visit the theme park in florida i proposed to girlfriend in front of toothless
[15324.92 --> 15330.60]  there a few weeks ago she counter-proposed i'll go to the theme park i made it about
[15330.60 --> 15336.36]  30 of the way through the live action how to train your dragon the original animated film is perfect
[15336.36 --> 15342.52]  and um the live action one is like a weird fun house mirror reflection of perfect
[15344.04 --> 15348.12]  they did stay very true to it and if it brings a new generation of people into
[15348.12 --> 15355.96]  you know thinking how to train your dragon and the sort of general message behind it of
[15355.96 --> 15359.96]  seeing past our differences even though we're enemies and all that kind of cool stuff i think
[15359.96 --> 15367.24]  it's a really cool story um you know if it does that then that's great i am a fan but i didn't
[15367.24 --> 15370.84]  personally have any use for it because the original was already a perfect film
[15370.84 --> 15383.88]  my award yeah what is this exactly i've received an award he's he doesn't he's talking but he
[15383.88 --> 15389.96]  doesn't he's not talking into a mic so is it another billy billy plaque um that's my guess i'm throwing
[15389.96 --> 15393.48]  a guess out there that's my guess you're throwing a guess a billy billy plaque no we already have a
[15393.48 --> 15402.44]  silver and a gold oh um i'm getting an award well i mean luke doesn't need to be here for this then
[15407.56 --> 15410.92]  it's fine it's no no no if you go in your camera they might be able to see it better
[15410.92 --> 15415.00]  just meeming okay they can see it after what is this
[15415.00 --> 15427.72]  actually what is it uh it's a linus media group uh what is this what yeah what linus media group
[15427.72 --> 15438.12]  brand impact award for hold on what is that for outstanding influence amplifying glinets worldwide
[15438.12 --> 15450.28]  presence oh no i did know about this they invited us to an event and um to to present it and i
[15450.28 --> 15455.32]  cool stuff i said regrettably we can't make it we did that we did that sponsored video with them
[15455.32 --> 15461.64]  recently i mean they make cool stuff upgrading natalie's house cool i didn't know that i get
[15461.64 --> 15466.84]  an award for doing a sponsored video you know they know they already paid me right for the sponsored
[15466.84 --> 15471.72]  video i mean getting award is also cool i mean i don't i don't mind honestly i think you should
[15471.72 --> 15476.52]  give me an award every time you pay me you want me to give you an award every time no no wait every
[15476.52 --> 15484.04]  time i pay you yeah i'd also have to give you an award no uh uh no wait yes and if you hold on i'm
[15484.04 --> 15484.44]  thinking
[15491.24 --> 15495.08]  see i was gonna say something like if you went sort of beyond the call of duty but he really does
[15495.08 --> 15502.44]  yeah he's great um how can i justify not giving him an award every time i pay him
[15503.72 --> 15511.24]  huh um maybe i should i'll tell you what here's what it'll be it'll be in the form of a monthly
[15511.96 --> 15517.88]  no a monthly budget on lttstore.com and occasional random lttstore.com things that's that's how we'll do
[15517.88 --> 15524.44]  it nice yeah conveniently we already do that so is it a yearly budget yeah but it could be broken up by 12.
[15525.08 --> 15531.96]  yeah being on wanshow you also end up with a lot of extras i do i have no complaints you know uh
[15532.60 --> 15538.44]  there is a company that you and i both visited recently that i figured out what their merch budget
[15538.44 --> 15546.76]  is is it good it's definitely lower than ours oh really oh oh is this company does
[15546.76 --> 15553.40]  how do we not name them yeah i and like i don't think we would ever name this yeah i don't think
[15553.40 --> 15559.08]  we should name them yeah but yeah that you know we actually have a pretty generous merch budget i
[15559.08 --> 15564.68]  realized that like we actually do try to not be a place to work i told them ours while we were having
[15564.68 --> 15569.24]  that conversation and they were like whoa and i didn't tell them the host one because the host one's
[15569.24 --> 15574.36]  higher it has to be because you're going to need stuff that you have when you're on camera like it yeah it
[15574.36 --> 15581.64]  has to be higher it makes sense i told them the like normal one yeah anyways we had this is a bit
[15581.64 --> 15587.56]  of a topic earlier hello lld with the current ram prices rising due to ai demand do you think now is
[15587.56 --> 15593.16]  a good time to upgrade what are the long-term effects of ai infrastructure on consumer grade
[15593.16 --> 15597.96]  hardware prices long term will be okay if anything it'll drive it down because they're going to build
[15597.96 --> 15604.04]  up massive capacity and the bubble will at the very least deflate probably burst and the used market
[15604.04 --> 15609.24]  traditionally has actually benefited from large infrastructure expenditure as for now being a good
[15609.24 --> 15613.96]  time to upgrade probably i don't i think it's going to get worse before it gets better uh but that's not
[15613.96 --> 15623.64]  financial advice hey luke sharing the love of all things nasa have you ever seen a launch in person i also
[15623.64 --> 15630.68]  for a short time got to work with nasa huntsville by a vendor customer relationship when did you get
[15630.68 --> 15635.48]  to see a launch in person one time i thought you missed it on like a thing recently i thought this
[15635.48 --> 15639.80]  was like another sore point there was a really cool one that i missed oh that's what i was this was a
[15639.80 --> 15647.56]  really random one uh but when aj and i were down there for the threat locker conference oh so this is
[15647.56 --> 15656.76]  recent then yeah we we took off to to go check out nasa and as we were pulling up uh there was one i i
[15656.76 --> 15661.08]  was like checking my news the whole time because you know there would only be specific times that we
[15661.08 --> 15665.80]  could go yeah uh and we thought we had missed it because we thought it had gone like the night before
[15665.80 --> 15671.00]  i think but there was some delay and it made it happen that day and then we couldn't go right away
[15671.00 --> 15675.80]  because we were doing stuff uh but by the time we could go we were like rolling up into the parking
[15675.80 --> 15680.84]  lot like when it was happening and we ran to this like corner where we could see it so we hadn't
[15680.84 --> 15687.64]  even entered yet nice we were and we uh technically walked into the employee parking lot well just
[15687.64 --> 15695.72]  confidently and got to a got to a corner sorry got to a corner where we can see security yeah and we
[15695.72 --> 15702.28]  actually got like a a pretty decent vantage point we ended up seeing like where a lot of people would
[15702.28 --> 15706.84]  watch it from the actual like kind of park thing that they have and our spot was like actually
[15706.84 --> 15715.64]  pretty solid um i'm really hoping to see one of the artemis launches eventually um a starship would
[15715.64 --> 15721.56]  be really cool sometime this was just more of like a fairly small somewhat routine thing that just
[15721.56 --> 15726.20]  happened to be going off the day the amount of rockets they're launching like all the time now is pretty
[15726.20 --> 15735.96]  wild so yeah um but then we promptly exited the i believe employee only parking area and entered the
[15735.96 --> 15744.20]  park properly and then had a good time it was great hi lld never knew i needed a hackable arch based vr
[15744.20 --> 15749.08]  headset until valve announced one any cool ideas considering you could almost certainly do anything
[15749.08 --> 15755.16]  with it also did it have a desktop mode i don't believe anything would prevent you from running desktop
[15755.16 --> 15763.56]  mode on it on a giant screen um for me i think the biggest um the biggest use case this unlocks
[15763.56 --> 15772.76]  for me for vr is travel with my laptop i am like stoked to play full fat pc vr games with a laptop with like
[15772.76 --> 15781.48]  an e gpu and my vr headset that all packs into like my commuter bag that's crazy absolutely wild i really
[15781.48 --> 15788.52]  enjoy the idea of this thing being portable that's uh yeah i'm for sure getting one basically kind of
[15788.52 --> 15793.56]  depends on price i guess and we both but i'm intending on it we both know the quest lineup exists but
[15793.56 --> 15799.40]  i don't think either of us has ever felt particularly compelled to go meta for our vr needs i have been
[15799.40 --> 15808.44]  fairly strongly turned off from that um yeah what was the product your own or third party that you knew
[15808.44 --> 15816.12]  about early that you found the hardest to keep secret oh oh man there's oh man
[15823.72 --> 15825.96]  the hardest to keep secret
[15825.96 --> 15832.84]  i don't actually find out about third party stuff that early
[15834.84 --> 15838.20]  and i don't keep secrets very well for our own developments
[15839.88 --> 15843.32]  like i think that's part of part of the marketing strategy at this point
[15845.08 --> 15849.00]  probably the one that i struggled the most on was our battery bank
[15849.00 --> 15856.76]  um which we have alluded to but not really talked about much yet but it's been in development for i
[15856.76 --> 15863.32]  think over two years now and for a long time i really didn't talk about it because the the product
[15863.32 --> 15869.40]  itself was not particularly well defined like we had um you know an idea of what we wanted to try to
[15869.40 --> 15875.64]  achieve and we've achieved a lot of that but not all of it and so we wanted to make sure that we weren't
[15875.64 --> 15881.48]  setting people's expectations too high it's getting pretty close to the point where i can start talking
[15881.48 --> 15886.04]  about it in more detail but yeah i'd say holding back a ton of that has been really challenging
[15887.88 --> 15889.16]  yes we're getting triple c
[15892.36 --> 15899.64]  you mentioned on last wan show that google killed the nest and a project was started i created it and
[15899.64 --> 15905.08]  open sourced it appreciate the shout out also google was still sending logs from those devices
[15906.52 --> 15912.20]  shout out cody k absolutely sick assuming you are actually the person who did it and you're not
[15912.20 --> 15918.20]  just taking credit but yeah that probably you probably you're honest but uh super cool and yeah that
[15918.20 --> 15921.88]  why does that not surprise me at all like i
[15924.36 --> 15927.88]  yeah shocked shocked i say well actually not that shocked like it's
[15930.36 --> 15933.88]  you shut off my functionality but yes still want my data really
[15936.20 --> 15942.20]  that's so cool if this person's the person who did that that's so sick enjoy your rgb sweater yeah
[15942.20 --> 15950.52]  hell yeah for both hosts for your main gaming rig are you team red or team blue for proc and wine
[15950.52 --> 15952.12]  well yeah obviously
[15955.24 --> 15959.88]  been red for a while yep better red than dead
[15959.88 --> 15967.40]  better dead than red i don't know it's rough over there right now man i hope they figure it out
[15967.40 --> 15971.80]  i hope so too uh a strong intel is good for the industry yeah
[15972.92 --> 15974.12]  last one i got for you tonight
[15974.12 --> 15981.40]  so lld i love your zipper hoodie so i'd never pass up the red wan hoodie sick but i was a big fan of
[15981.40 --> 15987.40]  orange hope to see that again one day also what happened to the pajama pants they were great they
[15987.40 --> 15992.68]  didn't sell that well i love them too i love my ltd pajama pants i only got one pair and i wish i had more
[15993.32 --> 15998.28]  um i don't know that we will do i don't know that we'll do an orange the red is selling really well
[15998.84 --> 16006.28]  and after many long sometimes surprisingly intense conversations like we have passionate people here
[16006.28 --> 16011.88]  and they can be passionate about everything design color you know fit materials right like
[16011.88 --> 16017.48]  the reason our products are good is because people care but when people care you can have strong
[16017.48 --> 16021.48]  opinions and you can have clashes and it's not like we have like a the kind of culture where people
[16021.48 --> 16027.08]  would like yell at each other or be mean to each other or whatever but i've had some some very
[16027.08 --> 16035.48]  opinionated conversations with particularly bridget who's head of fashion and um you know she felt very
[16035.48 --> 16044.76]  strongly that having some red and some orange wan products was really confusing and so we we we debated
[16044.76 --> 16051.96]  whether we should even be able to launch a red wan hoodie when we still have an orange wan backpack for
[16051.96 --> 16060.52]  instance and she made very good points about how that kind of confuses what wan branding means and i made
[16060.52 --> 16065.96]  very good points about how oh my god we can't hope to sell out all of the desk pads and all of the
[16065.96 --> 16071.56]  backpacks and all of the everything before we can like launch one product we want to get it out there
[16071.56 --> 16076.84]  and find out if people are going to even receive this red thing uh at all or if we're going to have to
[16076.84 --> 16081.00]  go back to orange anyway and then we wiped out all of inventory for nothing and then made a big bet
[16081.00 --> 16089.48]  on red everything for nothing um so everyone had really good points and what we settled on was okay
[16089.48 --> 16097.96]  i agree with you that it needs to not be confusing you're 100 right but the business needs us to test
[16097.96 --> 16106.92]  this before we can commit full hog and i think at this point she's one that red works and it's time to
[16106.92 --> 16114.44]  go full hog and once we do that then i think she's right that wan can't just be random colors it has to
[16114.44 --> 16122.04]  mean something and now i think it's going to mean red and gray and black well what chat has a very
[16122.04 --> 16128.28]  interesting point a lot of people in chat have a very interesting point does wan have an after dark
[16128.28 --> 16135.08]  sub brand no i think our monochrome brand is still stealth we haven't used it much purple lately oh
[16135.08 --> 16143.48]  interesting i could be open to that it's a genuinely really interesting idea the after dark hoodie i
[16143.48 --> 16148.60]  could get it i could yeah i could get behind that it's just interesting that we can throw purple into
[16148.60 --> 16158.12]  the brand mix very logically short circuit has it too short circuits um is predominantly purple isn't it
[16158.12 --> 16163.08]  it's a mix right yeah it's got it's got a variety of short circuit
[16165.08 --> 16173.48]  i like that dan just said short circuit nothing else i mean they're purple yeah they are their
[16173.48 --> 16177.08]  main color so their main color is purple they do they're like a bunch of stuff though
[16180.44 --> 16187.08]  orange pink purple white yeah dark blue all right yellow all right after dark hoodie
[16187.08 --> 16197.32]  i feel like an after dark hoodie might actually be really sick just saying
[16199.80 --> 16201.16]  after dark pants too
[16203.40 --> 16204.28]  assless chaps
[16207.80 --> 16210.68]  what what pants do we have right now that could be after darked
[16210.68 --> 16222.68]  all right scheduled for monday morning and excuse me sorry with that i think it's time to say
[16222.68 --> 16227.16]  good night and have a wonderful weekend we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[16227.16 --> 16229.32]  almost five hours bye that's crazy
[16234.28 --> 16238.68]  that was not
[16240.68 --> 16247.72]  huh
[16250.20 --> 16252.04]  that's
