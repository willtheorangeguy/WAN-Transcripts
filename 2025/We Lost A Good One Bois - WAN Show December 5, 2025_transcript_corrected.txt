[0.00 → 10.96] What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show.
[10.96 → 14.20] We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[14.32 → 24.62] Our headline topic is of course that Micron is going all in on AI and abandoning us poor
[24.62 → 25.40] consumers.
[26.34 → 28.94] I like the products Luke.
[28.94 → 35.56] So what if they had a couple price fixing scandals over the years who in the DRAM industry
[35.56 → 36.22] didn't.
[37.22 → 37.66] Okay.
[37.80 → 37.96] Yeah.
[38.00 → 41.64] I mean, that's, I mean, that's how price fixing works.
[41.64 → 46.28] It's when the whole industry gets together, and it's like, Hmm, you know what?
[46.60 → 49.02] If we're not the bad guy, but they're all sorry.
[49.08 → 52.86] If we're the bad guy, and they're also the bad guy, then we won't stand out.
[52.86 → 54.16] What are you going to do about it?
[54.20 → 57.04] But seriously, quality products, we're all just evil.
[57.04 → 60.54] I guess we just don't get to buy anymore.
[60.54 → 62.14] So we're going to be talking about that.
[62.26 → 67.30] We're also going to be talking about Netflix, making things worse for everyone again.
[67.70 → 72.14] And the justification for this is just, it's so weak.
[72.74 → 74.70] You know, it's so weak.
[74.76 → 75.46] It's a month.
[75.46 → 82.72] Speaking of not weak, Intel GPU market share hits a record level.
[83.18 → 83.56] Okay.
[83.74 → 84.60] One percent.
[85.36 → 86.12] Let's go.
[86.60 → 87.70] I'm excited about that.
[87.96 → 89.72] Intel is officially the one percent.
[89.84 → 90.08] Yeah.
[90.32 → 91.60] Congratulations, Intel.
[91.74 → 93.16] Time to buy a Mc Mansion.
[94.60 → 96.74] They're unfortunately the other end of the one.
[96.74 → 97.60] On financing.
[97.60 → 100.54] And, uh, I don't know.
[100.62 → 101.18] Ripped cherry?
[101.60 → 107.12] Uh, cherry is like, going, not for the same reasons as Micron.
[107.28 → 108.38] Cherry's in a pie.
[110.24 → 111.48] Because they're cooked.
[111.68 → 112.00] Baked.
[112.16 → 113.16] Well, okay, it doesn't matter.
[113.16 → 114.66] Just give it a minute.
[124.50 → 125.44] Oh, no.
[127.60 → 132.28] Um, okay.
[135.48 → 138.82] Oh, the show is brought to you by Green Heroes Daily and On TV.
[138.96 → 142.10] Along with our rep partner, Green, our laptop partner, Dale, and our chair partner, Secret Live.
[142.36 → 142.76] Dang.
[143.88 → 144.78] I got this.
[146.16 → 147.52] Look, it's not a speed issue.
[147.58 → 148.70] It's a pitch issue.
[149.08 → 149.54] Yeah.
[150.34 → 150.66] Please.
[151.54 → 153.80] Micron is going all in on AI.
[155.80 → 157.48] Micron Technology announced.
[158.00 → 158.96] The, oh, oh, God.
[159.46 → 159.78] Thanks.
[160.14 → 161.28] Micron Technology.
[161.42 → 162.44] Oh, you missed the funny part.
[162.50 → 163.10] Well, that's okay.
[163.32 → 163.76] We're good.
[164.30 → 166.64] Wait, did they not hear any of the sponsor call-outs then?
[167.04 → 167.54] No idea.
[167.80 → 168.16] Probably.
[169.76 → 171.72] Uh, okay.
[171.90 → 172.78] They said they could hear.
[174.56 → 176.78] Guys, we had our Christmas party last night.
[177.46 → 182.16] And I don't drink, but it was still a very tiring day.
[182.16 → 185.66] And as you can probably tell, I'm a little under the weather.
[185.80 → 186.88] So I'm going to do my best today.
[186.98 → 187.26] All right.
[188.08 → 194.10] Micron Technology has announced the impending demise of their consumer-focused Crucial brand
[194.10 → 200.16] on Wednesday, just months after the company celebrated its 29th anniversary.
[200.16 → 203.30] I mean, that last bit seems kind of irrelevant.
[203.48 → 207.42] You're always just months away from an anniversary of some sort.
[207.50 → 208.90] 29 seems kind of arbitrary.
[209.22 → 210.68] I'm deleting that from the notes.
[211.44 → 214.68] In a press release, the memory giant stated that,
[214.68 → 219.38] Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial Consumer business
[219.38 → 224.16] in order to improve supply and support for our larger strategic customers
[224.16 → 226.38] in faster-growing segments.
[228.60 → 232.54] In a nutshell, guess what, gamers?
[233.24 → 235.00] You just ben't that f***ING important.
[235.20 → 235.76] For now.
[236.36 → 236.94] For now.
[237.46 → 240.36] Until you come crawling back.
[240.62 → 242.44] Yeah, everyone's talking about a constant bubble.
[242.44 → 245.30] Everyone crawls back to gaming.
[246.14 → 246.58] Oh, yeah.
[246.78 → 248.12] Name someone who didn't.
[249.92 → 251.26] How many people have exited?
[252.56 → 253.56] Name someone who's exited.
[254.00 → 257.54] I mean, Crucial didn't exit-exit, but they did kill their ballistics brand once.
[257.64 → 261.20] Yeah, I mean, I feel like this has been hinted towards.
[261.40 → 262.14] This has been in the cards for a while.
[262.14 → 264.82] And then now they were like, hmm, there's a strong reason now.
[265.56 → 267.48] Well, I don't even think it's strong reason.
[267.58 → 269.50] I think it's just as simple as...
[269.50 → 271.66] VGA, I don't think, counts in this case, guys.
[271.66 → 273.18] Yeah, they didn't come back.
[275.02 → 277.82] But they left for completely different reasons.
[278.02 → 278.38] Yes.
[278.44 → 280.30] They didn't leave because there was more profit elsewhere.
[280.76 → 282.12] Well, yeah.
[284.26 → 286.84] Leaving because there's less profit where you are,
[287.22 → 289.66] or leaving because there's more profit elsewhere.
[290.60 → 294.26] They're both technically just different sides of the same coin.
[294.34 → 295.50] I think they're a little different.
[295.82 → 298.06] Because one of them is leaving because of opportunity,
[298.22 → 300.30] and the other one's leaving because of the lack of opportunity.
[300.30 → 300.74] Yeah.
[301.16 → 301.42] Yeah.
[301.48 → 303.00] Yeah, same coin.
[303.12 → 303.58] Same coin.
[303.68 → 304.26] Different sides.
[304.48 → 305.02] I think it matters.
[305.14 → 306.08] Different outcomes.
[306.42 → 306.70] Yeah.
[307.92 → 308.52] Yeah.
[309.04 → 313.50] Shipments of crucial products are expected to end in 2026,
[313.66 → 317.40] with warranty and support continuing for some time.
[317.40 → 321.38] I'm just bummed, right?
[321.38 → 325.16] Because at the end of the day, we talk about this endlessly.
[325.56 → 332.28] There is an inherent advantage to having more competition in the market
[332.28 → 336.32] and losing Micron in this space,
[336.32 → 341.94] which I guess technically they haven't announced.
[346.14 → 349.10] Actually, I guess, yeah, technically they haven't announced.
[349.10 → 358.78] So nothing would technically prevent a DRAM module maker from buying Micron DRAM chips.
[359.12 → 360.20] Which seems like what they want anyway.
[360.20 → 362.74] Continuing to make modules out of them.
[363.06 → 365.04] It's just that the crucial brand,
[365.16 → 368.04] the first party Micron retail brand crucial,
[368.54 → 372.46] is no longer going to be available to us.
[373.02 → 374.78] And, you know,
[375.12 → 380.20] I might have kind of talked myself out of being quite as bummed about this.
[380.20 → 382.94] I don't think so.
[383.18 → 385.90] To me, it feels like you're doing less competition.
[386.06 → 387.02] I think there's a lot of,
[387.32 → 391.28] like if you remember what happened with GPU prices during like 3000 series and whatnot,
[391.48 → 393.44] where they absolutely blew up.
[393.58 → 396.10] And then when that demand started fading,
[396.26 → 397.68] the prices didn't come back down.
[397.70 → 398.88] And then AI started happening.
[398.92 → 400.10] And then they went back up again.
[400.42 → 401.44] Oh, to be clear.
[401.56 → 405.86] This feels like an opportunity to crank DRAM prices.
[405.86 → 414.42] To be clear, the AI price bubble in memory is absolutely going to be felt for a very long time.
[414.60 → 414.64] Yeah.
[414.76 → 416.10] I'm not questioning that.
[416.26 → 419.88] I just mean the loss of the crucial brand specifically.
[420.20 → 420.64] Oh, yeah.
[420.92 → 421.12] Whatever.
[421.26 → 423.20] Maybe they weren't that crucial.
[424.70 → 426.62] Like you can still buy,
[426.80 → 429.18] you can still buy memory from Corsair.
[429.44 → 431.64] You can still buy memory from,
[431.72 → 432.68] I don't know,
[432.88 → 433.46] Patriot.
[433.46 → 436.32] I mean, man, you've experienced this, right?
[436.50 → 437.84] You show up at Computer
[437.84 → 441.24] and every year you walk the trade show floor there,
[441.72 → 445.44] there's probably a dozen memory brands you've never heard of.
[445.48 → 448.98] But you're probably looking at three memory brands worth Petrol chips.
[449.38 → 449.80] Probably.
[450.06 → 450.74] There's like flourish.
[450.74 → 452.78] Yeah, you got your Samsung, your SK Hynix,
[453.24 → 454.56] you got your Micron,
[454.74 → 455.14] you got,
[455.28 → 456.52] who am I forgetting guys?
[456.64 → 457.88] I'm sure I'm forgetting someone.
[458.26 → 458.94] The Chinese one.
[459.12 → 459.36] Important.
[459.36 → 460.78] Kaolin no longer makes DRAM.
[460.78 → 462.38] Chang shin memory technologies.
[462.60 → 463.08] Not for a long time.
[463.08 → 464.66] It's like a Chinese brand,
[464.72 → 467.62] so I don't know if we're actually seeing those in North American products.
[467.70 → 468.18] Not around here.
[468.28 → 469.56] Did I forget Samsung?
[470.00 → 470.28] Sorry.
[470.44 → 470.86] Yeah, Samsung.
[470.86 → 471.64] I thought you said Samsung.
[472.02 → 472.34] Did I?
[472.46 → 473.04] I don't know.
[473.12 → 473.42] I don't know.
[473.56 → 474.00] I'm not sure.
[474.64 → 475.32] Kingston, no.
[475.32 → 476.12] Not Hyper.
[476.48 → 479.00] Kingston is not an actual DRAM.
[480.50 → 480.60] Fab.
[481.16 → 482.28] Yeah, they're not a fab.
[482.62 → 484.46] They're a module packager.
[485.20 → 486.48] G-Skill, same thing.
[486.56 → 488.32] They are a module packager.
[488.32 → 490.38] They're not actually a fab.
[491.38 → 496.40] Yeah, like if I look at, I just popped up Amazon and took a look in the sidebar.
[496.80 → 497.12] Data.
[497.84 → 498.24] Sure.
[498.40 → 499.32] All the brands.
[499.54 → 503.72] Corsair, G-Skill, Team Group, Crucial, Kingston, XPG, Samsung, all the way down.
[504.10 → 504.26] Yeah.
[504.26 → 507.36] There's basically three brands making all of those chips.
[508.90 → 515.44] And I mean, I guess, yeah, you'll still be, I guess for me, what I'm actually going to miss,
[515.62 → 518.70] I'm going to miss Crucial more probably on the SSD side.
[519.24 → 525.84] Because while they've, for the most part, actually recently they've had some really nice Gen 5 drives,
[525.84 → 532.66] but for the most part, Crucial hasn't even necessarily been like the highest performing SSDs.
[532.78 → 537.46] But what they have been is one that I can trust that probably won't be trash.
[537.90 → 545.20] Whereas when I buy an SSD, like when it comes to, like, I don't, and maybe this is, maybe this is a really weird mentality,
[545.20 → 555.06] but I actually think I care more about the trust that I have in the brand for my SSD than for my RAM.
[555.50 → 562.36] Even though, like, RAM can have a huge impact, obviously, on system stability and performance.
[562.84 → 564.04] Yeah, I don't agree, I think.
[564.10 → 568.28] I just don't want to lose my data.
[569.06 → 574.26] And, you know, in my gaming system, realistically, my boot SSD probably doesn't matter that much.
[574.26 → 575.16] Yeah, that's my point.
[575.20 → 577.42] Because all of my data is going to be backed up somewhere else.
[577.52 → 583.42] But there are areas where I'm going to use an SSD that is not my gaming system.
[583.60 → 589.52] And, like, yeah, okay, I should run RAID 1, you know, on my boot drive on my NAS.
[589.86 → 591.06] Off-site stuff, too, yeah.
[591.18 → 594.00] That can be just annoying to have to restore and whatnot.
[594.26 → 594.70] Yeah!
[594.94 → 595.14] Yeah.
[595.14 → 600.72] And, like, RAM, I can run a system stress test, and then I'm going to have a pretty good idea if it works.
[600.72 → 606.62] It's a, you know, it doesn't wear the same way that NAND flash does.
[607.54 → 613.18] And with DRAM, like, the way the grading works for it, it's more down to speed.
[613.40 → 615.32] It's more down to performance bins.
[615.32 → 615.72] Yeah.
[615.72 → 619.96] So, if it's, like, working, it will probably stay working.
[620.14 → 622.66] Like, there isn't, like, a better reliability grade.
[622.90 → 630.10] Whereas with NAND flash, they're graded, not just in terms of performance, but they're graded in terms of their reliability.
[630.10 → 643.18] In terms of, so, when I'm buying an SSD from a Random brand, I don't know if I'm getting an OCT agility or if I'm getting, you know, again.
[643.38 → 653.34] So, now I'm sitting here going, okay, well, who am I going to, then, for my definitely using reliable A-tier NAND in their consumer brand?
[653.46 → 654.32] Plenty of other options.
[654.32 → 658.24] Yeah, there's Samsung, who's probably going to be, probably will be fine.
[659.02 → 661.44] Give me another, give me another first party one, though.
[661.54 → 665.08] Like, actually, does SK Hynix, SK Hynix does have their own consumer brand.
[665.10 → 665.26] Isn't it Team Group?
[666.28 → 667.66] Isn't that SK Hynix?
[667.74 → 667.98] No.
[668.78 → 673.90] No, SK Hynix has their own consumer brand, but I don't think they're, I don't think they have a presence in North America.
[675.38 → 677.06] Does Team Group just use them a lot?
[677.44 → 679.12] I remember there being something about that.
[679.84 → 680.84] SK Hynix.
[681.28 → 682.38] I'm going to, I'm going to check.
[682.38 → 686.32] Oh, yeah, SK Hynix is in North America now.
[687.00 → 687.24] Okay.
[687.48 → 688.92] It was just first party branded.
[689.76 → 691.20] What the heck is this?
[692.06 → 693.74] Lev, that's what I was thinking, not Team Group.
[694.02 → 695.16] Lev, my bad.
[696.02 → 696.62] My bad.
[696.80 → 697.82] I meant, yeah, I meant Lev.
[697.92 → 699.32] I don't know why I screwed those up.
[699.42 → 701.66] It's Dan, hi, he's the problem, it's Dan.
[703.68 → 704.50] Check this out.
[705.42 → 708.48] Oh, that's Luke, I pressed Linus laptop.
[709.96 → 710.36] Nice.
[710.36 → 713.44] So I was, yeah, so SK Hynix, definitely.
[713.98 → 715.08] Also, what is this?
[717.66 → 718.14] Huh.
[718.74 → 719.46] Oh my.
[719.78 → 720.46] Oh my.
[720.58 → 721.24] Oh my.
[721.36 → 722.18] Oh my.
[722.30 → 724.74] Yeah, Lev is closely tied to SK Hynix.
[724.90 → 729.54] It's from the brand Essen core, which is, they distribute SK Hynix memory, blah, blah, blah.
[729.72 → 730.08] Got it.
[730.18 → 730.62] Okay, cool.
[730.62 → 735.52] Anyway, still a downer.
[736.20 → 741.76] We're never going to root for a company exiting a space because.
[741.88 → 742.62] No, this is bad.
[742.82 → 742.90] Yeah.
[742.96 → 745.64] Because from our point of view, more competition is better.
[746.18 → 747.36] But it's not like.
[747.36 → 751.48] It's clear where their focus has been anyway.
[752.66 → 753.06] Yeah.
[753.54 → 759.34] Like they could have kept the crucial brand and just quietly like not manufactured anything.
[759.58 → 764.74] And they might not have had the same, you know, headline splash that they're getting now.
[764.74 → 769.42] But the effect would have been exactly the same because they're only making so many wafers.
[770.70 → 773.44] And then they choose what to make on those wafers.
[773.58 → 779.54] And they're obviously going to target their commercial customers.
[779.54 → 779.70] Yeah.
[779.80 → 785.38] And it's been, it's been, if you, if you've been paying attention at all, which I can, I don't really blame you too much for not.
[785.48 → 792.18] But if you have, it's been pretty brutally and blatantly obvious that nobody in the DRAM space cares about you at all.
[792.18 → 793.62] Just like.
[793.90 → 794.94] It's literally a commodity.
[795.20 → 795.94] Be super clear.
[796.22 → 803.52] And, and it has been constant price fixing for like getting close to like 30 years.
[803.74 → 804.94] Like this is not.
[805.00 → 806.76] Not constant, but a cycle.
[807.08 → 810.66] There's been a cycle of, hey, these guys all got caught price fixing.
[810.70 → 815.82] They've been caught price fixing every like five to eight years for like 30 years.
[815.86 → 816.62] I think it's been at least three.
[816.62 → 817.72] To me that feels constant.
[817.72 → 822.28] Three times that I can think of in the time that I've been a PC enthusiast.
[822.82 → 828.38] But when I, when I say it's literally commodity, I do mean it is like literally a commodity.
[828.38 → 836.64] Like you can, you can get an account on DRAM exchange, and you can watch the tickers for all the various, all the various DRAMs.
[838.20 → 842.02] And that's been a thing again, for as long as I've been part of the industry.
[842.02 → 851.46] So the good thing though, the good news is that as a commodity, when it falls, it actually does tend to fall, fall.
[852.00 → 854.58] And it may, we may have a shot.
[854.58 → 858.86] I just feel like this might be one of the stepping stones towards resisting that fall.
[859.24 → 860.28] Oh, it'll resist it.
[860.28 → 862.08] I mean, you remember the what was it?
[862.14 → 872.80] I think it was the Thailand floods that wiped out like over half of the production, like global production capacity for the motors that spin hard drives.
[873.16 → 877.80] That was a thing back in, what was it like 2013 or something like that?
[877.90 → 878.08] Really?
[878.22 → 879.46] Was it that recently?
[880.32 → 882.42] When, when were the, the...
[882.42 → 888.14] I thought we were, I often gauge news based on when and where we were talking about on a way.
[888.16 → 888.52] 2011.
[888.96 → 890.32] I'm closest without going over.
[890.42 → 890.88] Let's go.
[891.20 → 891.52] That's true.
[892.06 → 893.08] No, seriously though.
[893.14 → 893.94] It was, it was around...
[893.94 → 895.96] Were we still suffering the effects at that time maybe?
[897.06 → 897.46] Probably.
[897.76 → 898.48] That might be a chance.
[898.48 → 898.50] Yeah.
[898.50 → 900.44] So, so that, well, that's exactly what I was going to say.
[900.76 → 905.20] The, the Thailand floods, so hold on.
[905.26 → 910.10] They started in July, intensified in September and October, finally receded by January 2012.
[910.10 → 915.26] So we were actually, we were actually both close to the, the period.
[915.42 → 919.96] So during that time, hard drives went from like historic lows.
[920.12 → 922.32] Like they were, they were dirt cheap.
[922.38 → 923.48] It was sort of comical.
[923.48 → 929.46] Like you were basically buying a hard drive for practically the like scrap metal price of a hard drive.
[929.46 → 939.88] And then they went to the point where like at NCI, our strategy for trying to have any hard drives
[939.88 → 953.94] in stock at hopefully some price that anyone would want to pay was we, we actually enlisted people internally to just go buy like retail hard drives, like external hard drives.
[953.94 → 956.72] And then shuck them so that we could put them in bags.
[956.80 → 959.84] I don't know if we ever actually did it, but we certainly talked about it.
[960.46 → 963.96] Um, just to like, everyone was like, like land grabbing.
[964.14 → 969.20] It was like the apocalypse and people like hoarding ammunition and canned food.
[969.32 → 969.84] But it was like...
[969.84 → 972.78] I remember people buying the enclosures from Costco and shucking them.
[972.84 → 974.18] I remember consumers doing that.
[974.18 → 984.64] Because basically every drive that was out in the retail channel already that was sold at the dirt cheap prices had just doubled or tripled in value.
[984.64 → 986.34] Like it was, it was insane.
[986.76 → 991.80] Um, what happened, and it was, it was a long, it was a long time.
[991.80 → 1001.76] So on the one hand, like, yes, uh, part of why it took so long to recover was that you don't just build a motor factory overnight.
[1001.76 → 1003.28] That's just not how that works.
[1003.36 → 1005.90] So it took time for them to ramp production back up.
[1006.04 → 1012.46] And the other part of it is that they took their sweet time ramping production back up.
[1012.46 → 1017.34] Because, uh, I remember WD was probably the biggest beneficiary of it.
[1017.44 → 1019.74] Like their stock went bonkers.
[1020.04 → 1021.54] Profit maxing at the time was wild.
[1021.72 → 1027.68] Because it, the actual cost of the hard drive didn't really change.
[1027.84 → 1030.46] It was just that the supply got choked out.
[1030.46 → 1032.32] So the demand went way up.
[1032.56 → 1035.72] So the profit margins that they were able to make went way higher.
[1035.96 → 1036.32] But, and.
[1037.76 → 1038.72] Well, I thought you were done.
[1038.86 → 1039.22] I thought you were done.
[1039.60 → 1044.56] I was going to say, I understand that you're, you're pointing out you can, you can buy commodity der amble.
[1045.04 → 1054.28] But it really feels like, uh, a while ago, Sam Altman said that they're doing great stuff with like tech innovation, but they need to start doing financial innovation.
[1054.28 → 1059.78] And that was a little bit before this whole circular money funnel thing started happening.
[1059.94 → 1065.56] And it feels like there are a lot more facets to this instead of just trading money in a circle.
[1065.76 → 1067.50] I think there are a lot of things happening.
[1067.62 → 1072.68] I think this is one of them where Nvidia is deciding to decouple their shipments.
[1072.74 → 1075.18] So they're not shipping dream with their chips anymore.
[1075.72 → 1077.78] Micron is taking crucial out of the market.
[1077.92 → 1079.08] All this stuff is happening.
[1079.08 → 1083.16] I think it feels like they're trying to pump Ram, uh, like as hard as they can.
[1083.30 → 1083.94] Oh, I don't, I don't.
[1084.14 → 1084.64] Along with everything.
[1084.74 → 1086.20] I don't think they're pumping Ram.
[1086.30 → 1089.08] I think they're just, I think there is a shortage.
[1089.14 → 1092.94] I think is what it boils down to because there's a there's a wafer shortage right now.
[1093.10 → 1093.50] Sure.
[1093.62 → 1094.62] Like they can't get enough.
[1094.62 → 1096.64] That's just like the Nvidia one is weird to me.
[1096.64 → 1099.06] Cause that's just more opportunity for Nvidia to mark things up.
[1099.42 → 1101.12] Well, what it is.
[1101.18 → 1102.84] Well, it's, it's just that they can't get it.
[1103.54 → 1105.84] They want to ship, they want to ship GPUs.
[1106.32 → 1108.64] They're just, they're not going to stop shipping GPUs.
[1108.64 → 1110.96] I don't know how much they care about shipping consumer GPUs.
[1111.06 → 1113.56] Well, no, no, but shipping, no, they'll ship any GPU.
[1114.14 → 1115.86] They're just, they just want to ship GPUs.
[1116.04 → 1122.46] And if supply of DRAM for their packaged GPU DRAM packet, or VRAM, I guess it'd be in this
[1122.46 → 1126.16] case, but whatever, basically RAM, DRAM, uh, dynamic random access memory.
[1126.32 → 1130.14] So if they're, if they can't get the supply of the other widget, like think what happened
[1130.14 → 1132.74] to the car industry during the silicon shortage during COVID.
[1133.00 → 1137.62] They just had these, these almost finished cars that were just waiting on processors.
[1137.62 → 1138.86] I don't feel like that's the actual problem here.
[1138.86 → 1140.42] I could be wrong, but I don't feel like that's the actual problem here.
[1140.42 → 1141.40] It's definitely part of it.
[1141.44 → 1142.92] 100% it's part of it.
[1142.94 → 1143.16] Maybe.
[1143.52 → 1147.10] There's, there's no way it's not part of it because remember too, it's not just the
[1147.10 → 1147.54] supply.
[1147.70 → 1149.60] It's also not knowing what the cost is.
[1149.74 → 1152.72] So it's really hard to price something where you can't get it.
[1153.26 → 1158.42] And also when you finally do get it, it might cost more than what your anticipated quote
[1158.42 → 1159.12] was before.
[1159.70 → 1161.40] Nvidia doesn't want to carry that liability.
[1161.40 → 1165.72] So if they just ship the GPUs, and they make it someone else's problem, then they don't
[1165.72 → 1166.80] have to worry about that.
[1167.42 → 1168.64] I just think it's certain.
[1168.74 → 1173.92] Maybe I think it's part of a series of steps that are going to result in DRAM prices being
[1173.92 → 1175.36] permanently higher than they were before.
[1175.36 → 1186.14] So I, I would say that except that the, the long-term, the like zoom out from the, the crisis
[1186.14 → 1194.38] we're in now zoom out view is we've been through shortages before and DRAM's overall price trend
[1194.38 → 1196.76] towards getting way cheaper over time.
[1196.76 → 1200.02] My point is that they're making systemic changes that might resist that in the future.
[1200.14 → 1204.40] Crucial being out of the market and, and Nvidia not packaging things together and certain
[1204.40 → 1205.74] other steps that are happening as well.
[1205.94 → 1210.50] Well, I also agree that I think it's going to fall as this whole AI things like rather
[1210.50 → 1212.70] clearly a bubble that's going to pop at some point.
[1212.80 → 1213.98] So there's, there are a couple of things.
[1213.98 → 1219.48] So one is like Samsung has never been in the consumer DRAM market, or I shouldn't say never
[1219.48 → 1227.80] actually in the DDR one days you could buy consumer Samsung memory modules, but I think DDR2
[1227.80 → 1230.86] and onward, definitely you couldn't with DDR3.
[1230.86 → 1235.34] They went OEM only, and they went enterprise only.
[1236.20 → 1243.30] And that clearly has not had a devastating impact on the consumer DRAM market other than
[1243.30 → 1246.28] when they've been caught price fixing along with the rest of the industry.
[1246.82 → 1253.22] But again, so the, the macro trend of DRAM pricing marching ever downward, in spite of
[1253.22 → 1257.66] there having been shortages, there having been price fixing scandals, there having been
[1257.66 → 1264.90] major manufacturers of, of, of DRAM chips not participating in the retail market.
[1265.00 → 1268.06] All of these things have been true at various points in the past.
[1268.06 → 1272.16] And DRAM has marched ever downward other than blips.
[1272.34 → 1276.94] And the reason that I think that this time will be no different is that unlike the Thailand
[1276.94 → 1282.68] floods, where we did see elevated hard drive pricing for a very long time, they rode that
[1282.68 → 1286.70] wave as long as they could with the major hard drive players.
[1286.80 → 1291.86] You've got WD and Seagate sitting there, you know, kind of going,
[1293.26 → 1295.12] Yeah, who's going to, who's going to crack first?
[1295.12 → 1295.84] Who's going to blink?
[1296.00 → 1296.88] Who's going to blink?
[1296.96 → 1298.26] Who wants the volume back?
[1298.34 → 1303.76] But the PC industry, the electronics industry in general always wants the volume back.
[1303.76 → 1311.06] And unlike what happened with hard drives, DRAM, DRAM production has not really been disrupted
[1311.06 → 1314.84] other than the silicon wafer shortage that's going on right now.
[1314.92 → 1316.06] So there's a supply.
[1316.58 → 1319.98] It's just so much easier for them to control it because with the hard drives, it was the
[1319.98 → 1320.62] motors, right?
[1320.70 → 1321.84] At least in this case.
[1322.72 → 1325.26] With, with DRAM here, it's, it's nothing.
[1325.38 → 1326.60] There's just only three players.
[1326.60 → 1330.66] And I, I've seen some comments talking about like, oh yeah, but it's a free market.
[1331.02 → 1334.76] So someone will just come in and undercut them, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1334.84 → 1335.62] It's not going to happen.
[1335.72 → 1336.34] There are three fabs.
[1336.40 → 1337.36] Actually, the Chinese might.
[1338.04 → 1339.42] They're, they're working hard at it.
[1339.42 → 1340.46] They've got one at least.
[1340.68 → 1340.88] Yeah.
[1341.26 → 1345.40] Um, and, and even if they, even if they don't, I mean, it's a volume game.
[1345.58 → 1351.38] Once you've got your fab running, you, they will, they, they will at times doesn't happen
[1351.38 → 1354.28] that often, but they'll, they'll run them at a loss.
[1354.28 → 1359.64] If that's the commodity market, it's not that dissimilar from industries like farming,
[1359.78 → 1361.94] which is kind of crazy to think about.
[1362.12 → 1365.76] But once you've made the investment, once you've got all the infrastructure, once you've
[1365.76 → 1370.92] got all the trained workers for a short period of time, it can actually be less impactful
[1370.92 → 1376.70] on your business to run it at a loss in the shorter term in order to starve out your competitors.
[1376.84 → 1379.44] That's how we ended up with so much consolidation in the industry.
[1379.44 → 1388.62] Um, so I am hopeful in the medium to longer term in the short term, this is going to suck.
[1388.76 → 1389.14] Yeah.
[1389.32 → 1389.88] A lot.
[1389.98 → 1392.46] And so I think we're a hundred percent aligned there.
[1392.58 → 1392.88] Yes.
[1393.36 → 1395.02] And have you guys done that thing yet?
[1395.54 → 1395.90] Hold on.
[1395.96 → 1396.24] Hold on.
[1396.24 → 1401.90] And one thing that's going to suck for maybe the short to even medium term is that while
[1401.90 → 1407.34] they are not turning off any capacity other than what is constrained by a lack of wafers,
[1407.80 → 1414.24] um, the, the active decision appears to have been made to not build any more capacity.
[1414.24 → 1416.92] I saw at least one of them hit the news for that.
[1416.98 → 1418.20] One of the major DRAM guys.
[1418.42 → 1418.76] Yeah.
[1418.76 → 1423.18] I haven't seen because if they built more capacity, basically they, they, they run it.
[1423.26 → 1424.34] You just run it.
[1424.38 → 1426.10] You don't just let a fab sit idle.
[1426.62 → 1434.54] Um, and once that happens again, commodity, I remind you prices will be suppressed by increased
[1434.54 → 1435.30] capacity.
[1436.06 → 1441.40] Um, but for now it's going to be a really, really, really rough ride.
[1442.12 → 1442.98] What do you get there?
[1442.98 → 1443.38] Yeah.
[1443.54 → 1448.06] Two of the biggest DRAM suppliers are skeptical about increasing production as they eye long-term
[1448.06 → 1448.62] profitability.
[1448.76 → 1448.98] Yeah.
[1449.00 → 1449.86] I mean, wouldn't you?
[1450.32 → 1456.92] If WCCF tech everyone pretty much with two functioning brain cells to rub together knows
[1456.92 → 1463.76] that this AI thing is not going to continue on its parabolic trend forever.
[1464.10 → 1465.74] Samsung and SK Hynix.
[1466.20 → 1467.72] Those are the two companies.
[1467.86 → 1471.76] If you listen to, if you listen to, you know, Sam Altman talk about it, he's like, yeah,
[1471.76 → 1477.62] well, uh, um, AI forever, forever in AI to infinity and beyond.
[1477.62 → 1478.30] And right.
[1478.44 → 1482.42] Like they, they, uh, kind of showed their concerned hand a little bit.
[1482.50 → 1483.12] They have lately.
[1483.38 → 1483.60] Yeah.
[1483.80 → 1489.00] So if you were, if you were a DRAM manufacturer, and you were looking at the currently scaling
[1489.00 → 1495.62] demand for AI DRAM, would you go, Hmm, I've seen this movie before.
[1495.96 → 1503.68] No, I am not going to 10 X my manufacturing capacity because when the demand inevitably collapses
[1503.68 → 1510.88] or at the very least, uh, levels off, I'm going to be stuck with, you know, half a dozen fabs
[1510.88 → 1513.44] that I just don't have any demand for.
[1513.52 → 1515.42] That's, that's going to be a pretty big write down.
[1515.54 → 1516.94] The kind that gets me fired.
[1516.94 → 1522.12] Um, I honestly can't say that I would do anything win bond.
[1522.26 → 1524.40] Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time.
[1524.58 → 1526.36] Loki mentioned this in flow plane chat.
[1526.48 → 1528.00] Apparently they're back in the game.
[1528.66 → 1531.26] Uh, they're making DDR four.
[1531.62 → 1536.02] Did they ever, did they ever leave the game or did they just kind of go, go quiet?
[1536.20 → 1537.24] Maybe they just went quiet.
[1537.36 → 1538.00] I have no idea.
[1538.18 → 1538.74] Win bond.
[1538.82 → 1539.70] I mean, it's like DFI.
[1539.84 → 1541.96] Like, you know, DFI totally still exists, right?
[1542.26 → 1542.50] Yep.
[1542.62 → 1546.56] Like, like DFI land party, like the overclocking motherboards from way back in the day.
[1546.62 → 1547.68] They're totally still a thing.
[1547.74 → 1548.74] They do industrial boards.
[1549.46 → 1551.02] Um, yeah.
[1551.02 → 1552.24] People are saying went quiet.
[1552.72 → 1554.92] I haven't heard about them in forever.
[1555.16 → 1555.76] Win bond.
[1555.90 → 1557.60] Get me some BH five.
[1558.12 → 1558.80] Let's go.
[1559.82 → 1560.08] Yeah.
[1560.08 → 1560.64] That's interesting.
[1560.82 → 1563.66] Get me some overclocking DDR one.
[1563.66 → 1568.50] Like that's, that's the last time I remember wind bond really showing up on my radar as a
[1568.50 → 1569.36] consumer anyway.
[1569.56 → 1569.66] Yeah.
[1569.66 → 1573.32] So they're specifically saying, despite the increasing adoption of DDR five, many industries
[1573.32 → 1577.14] continue to rely on DDR four for its proven stability and well-established ecosystem.
[1577.64 → 1580.78] When bonds, eight gig DDR four DRAM is designed for a little, a little, a little, a little.
[1581.68 → 1582.02] Neat.
[1583.10 → 1584.68] Maybe I just haven't been aware of them.
[1585.08 → 1585.54] Oh, job.
[1585.60 → 1586.00] What do you says?
[1586.06 → 1587.62] Samsung is denying that now.
[1587.74 → 1589.44] Oh, wait, no, it was responding to another chatter.
[1589.56 → 1590.20] So hold on.
[1590.28 → 1591.04] Never mind.
[1591.28 → 1592.14] Ignore what I just said.
[1592.14 → 1593.10] I thought they were talking to you.
[1594.52 → 1596.78] Um, anyway.
[1596.78 → 1606.70] Oh, in other memory news, um, Samsung is denying reports that its semiconductor division recently
[1606.70 → 1613.10] refused to give its mobile experience division a 12-month supply of DRAM and instead the mobile
[1613.10 → 1616.10] division to negotiate requests for DRAM quarterly.
[1616.10 → 1621.64] Uh, stories appeared in SED Daily and WCCF Tech citing unnamed industry sources.
[1621.64 → 1627.98] Um, and PC Gamer says the stories come as Samsung's semiconductors restructuring production lines to focus on high
[1627.98 → 1631.00] margin products like HBM and low power DRAM.
[1631.00 → 1635.72] According to an update posted by PC Gamer, Samsung says the claim that its semiconductor division has
[1635.72 → 1641.44] rejected certain customer requests is incorrect and that recent reports that Samsung's DS division
[1641.44 → 1644.20] has rejected customer requests are baseless and not true.
[1644.32 → 1647.44] We're in close communication with global customers to address industry needs.
[1647.44 → 1647.72] Okay.
[1648.18 → 1652.82] Cause that was, that was kind of a spicy, that was a spicy little bit of news that apparently
[1652.82 → 1653.54] Samsung's own.
[1653.54 → 1656.82] Yeah, but that statement doesn't feel like it rejects the original statement at all.
[1656.96 → 1657.88] Did I just hear that wrong?
[1657.88 → 1664.90] Is there, aren't, aren't they talking about like the claim was that they refused to award a year's
[1664.90 → 1668.76] worth of DRAM to their mobile phone division and wanted to negotiate quarterly.
[1668.88 → 1673.24] And the response was, we're in close communication with global customers.
[1673.46 → 1675.50] That has nothing to do with the concern.
[1675.66 → 1679.90] But they're also saying that it's not true that they rejected certain customer requests.
[1680.74 → 1683.38] So what exactly this means?
[1683.62 → 1684.90] We'll never know.
[1684.90 → 1692.46] Um, but I sincerely doubt that your galaxy phone is not going to get memory.
[1692.46 → 1694.68] I was going to say, I sincerely doubt it matters.
[1694.68 → 1699.28] Like whether they start doing quarterly or yearly negotiations internally isn't, who cares?
[1700.36 → 1701.88] It might be more expensive.
[1702.66 → 1703.18] Hooray.
[1703.60 → 1704.08] Hooray.
[1704.34 → 1704.60] Yeah.
[1704.60 → 1705.46] It's almost certainly.
[1705.60 → 1705.88] It's okay.
[1705.98 → 1708.28] You probably don't need a new phone, so it's all right.
[1709.24 → 1709.94] Unless you do.
[1710.64 → 1710.82] Yeah.
[1710.86 → 1711.60] Which would be a downer.
[1711.66 → 1712.26] You could use one.
[1713.04 → 1713.62] That's true.
[1713.94 → 1714.18] Yeah.
[1714.26 → 1716.28] I mean, even, I mean, we saw it with GPUs.
[1716.32 → 1718.62] Even the secondhand market can be impacted by.
[1718.78 → 1719.86] Are phones pumping right now?
[1720.16 → 1720.86] I won't be too surprised.
[1721.06 → 1721.16] I doubt it.
[1721.16 → 1722.20] They're probably going to be delayed.
[1722.42 → 1722.78] Not yet.
[1722.78 → 1723.46] It'll be delayed.
[1723.76 → 1723.94] Yeah.
[1723.94 → 1725.36] Because, I mean, that's the thing, right?
[1725.44 → 1727.70] Is a lot of this stuff is purchased on contract.
[1727.70 → 1732.98] So, that's why there were a bunch of headlines over the last probably month or two saying
[1732.98 → 1734.82] that, oh yeah, watch out.
[1735.32 → 1736.88] DRAM pricing is going to go way up.
[1736.98 → 1740.90] Like the headlines started hitting before the price increases started hitting.
[1741.38 → 1742.70] And they'd be like, yeah, watch out.
[1743.80 → 1745.16] DRAM prices are going up.
[1745.74 → 1750.78] And, you know, major memory OEMs are saying that they're completely booked through 2026.
[1751.00 → 1752.56] Like that's the thing, right?
[1752.64 → 1755.74] Is we actually, oh, is this one, is that one out yet?
[1755.78 → 1757.28] Is the Rossiya Fab Tour out yet?
[1757.70 → 1759.98] I reviewed it, but I don't know if it's up yet.
[1760.80 → 1762.08] Anyway, no, I don't think it is.
[1762.16 → 1767.70] Anyway, one little detail from the Rossiya Fab Tour that a lot of people don't realize
[1767.70 → 1776.34] is that the processes that these wafers undergo for semiconductor manufacturing, it's not like
[1776.34 → 1785.82] they go, and they set up the mask, and they like, you know, hit it with the deep UV or the
[1785.82 → 1787.12] extreme UV light.
[1787.54 → 1789.86] And then it's like, yay, wafer done.
[1790.76 → 1799.64] It's many, many, many steps, like hundreds or even thousands of steps that these wafers go through
[1799.64 → 1801.70] from the very start to the very end.
[1801.70 → 1807.94] They will travel many, many miles throughout the fab to complete all the various layers
[1807.94 → 1809.80] and steps and build these things up.
[1810.38 → 1814.28] And it can take, not it can take, it takes months.
[1814.28 → 1824.14] So the timelines that these companies are operating on are not just like, oh, we got a big order.
[1824.60 → 1826.46] Let's make that order.
[1826.84 → 1828.36] It doesn't work like that.
[1828.42 → 1829.46] It's all forecasting.
[1829.46 → 1833.86] It's all pre-negotiation to the greatest extent that they possibly can.
[1834.34 → 1841.70] So it will be a while before these capacity constraints start to really hit us because
[1841.70 → 1844.46] I guarantee that someone like Apple is...
[1844.46 → 1846.90] Well, they hit us now because we're computer people.
[1847.68 → 1848.36] Yes.
[1848.98 → 1854.02] But in terms of like consumer electronics, I guarantee you that Apple is talking to major
[1854.02 → 1860.16] DRAM manufacturers many, many months, even years in advance sometimes for their product
[1860.16 → 1863.80] procurement, and they are pre-negotiating what their pricing is going to be.
[1864.36 → 1868.34] So yeah, the next iPhone might be okay.
[1868.56 → 1874.36] But if the AI boom continues, and they don't build more supply in order to alleviate the supply
[1874.36 → 1878.86] constraints, then the next, next iPhone might see a significant price jump.
[1879.82 → 1880.74] Or it might not, Apple.
[1880.74 → 1891.64] Apple has margin to play with, which sometimes, very, very rarely, they do used to absorb some
[1891.64 → 1896.60] increase in materials cost in order to keep their retail-friendly pricing.
[1896.78 → 1898.86] Not very often.
[1899.22 → 1903.76] But like on their base tier, on their base tier models, for instance, they can go very aggressive
[1903.76 → 1904.36] sometimes.
[1904.72 → 1905.92] Like, man, the Mac Mini.
[1905.92 → 1910.90] I think they had a Black Friday deal on it, too, last week.
[1912.68 → 1915.88] That thing is just such a great value in its base configuration.
[1918.84 → 1919.40] Oh, okay.
[1919.60 → 1920.00] Thanks, Dan.
[1920.36 → 1922.20] House Fab Tour is coming in 10 days, apparently.
[1923.48 → 1923.96] All right.
[1924.04 → 1925.60] What do you want to talk about next, sir?
[1926.14 → 1927.04] Something else.
[1927.34 → 1928.04] Something else.
[1928.34 → 1929.00] Let's see.
[1929.12 → 1929.44] Netflix.
[1929.82 → 1930.22] Hooray.
[1931.92 → 1935.12] Netflix makes things worse for everyone again.
[1935.12 → 1935.72] Wow.
[1936.24 → 1937.38] Netflix buying the newbie.
[1937.38 → 1938.22] That's what you chose?
[1939.22 → 1941.58] Uh, looks like this thing has been updated, maybe?
[1942.08 → 1942.36] Yeah.
[1942.48 → 1945.18] We've added a new thing that happened, like, today.
[1945.36 → 1945.80] Wow.
[1946.06 → 1946.30] Nice.
[1946.42 → 1951.26] Uh, after previously gatekeeping casting from the ad-supported plan, Netflix has officially
[1951.26 → 1954.36] removed support for casting to most devices.
[1954.58 → 1958.90] Definitely not all, and some of the selection of them are weird, but to most devices.
[1959.32 → 1960.78] Uh, oh boy.
[1961.28 → 1962.26] On all plans.
[1962.86 → 1963.24] I lost it.
[1963.24 → 1963.54] There it is.
[1963.54 → 1967.68] Uh, Netflix has quietly pushed an update with zero warning and only addressed the growing
[1967.68 → 1972.86] outrage by updating their help page after Android Authority broke the story about in-
[1972.86 → 1975.54] nation on December 1st.
[1975.76 → 1984.58] Uh, the not-so-long list of devices that's still allowed to cast from Netflix, um, but still
[1984.58 → 1990.62] only on the non-ad-supported plan is the third gen of Chromecast or older.
[1991.06 → 1991.38] What?
[1991.48 → 1992.62] That's a weird choice.
[1992.72 → 1993.56] This is what I meant.
[1993.74 → 1994.00] Yeah.
[1994.36 → 1999.20] Um, Google Nest Hub Smart Display, which I believe is also old.
[1999.74 → 2006.94] Um, select cast-enabled Vizio TVs and select cast-enabled Kumar TVs.
[2006.94 → 2009.02] Okay.
[2009.02 → 2015.58] Uh, the, the best guest, uh, the best guest that, uh, there are two different writers on this,
[2015.60 → 2021.72] so I'm not sure, but one of the writers, uh, was able to find, uh, was from Pill Lamb Mod
[2021.72 → 2027.64] on Reddit, uh, who said that casting was the last way to circumvent password sharing rules,
[2027.64 → 2032.24] uh, before, so long as your phone had connected to your home Wi-Fi within the last month,
[2032.34 → 2037.62] you could watch Netflix on any TV, including a friend's, uh, ex-butters from the same thread,
[2037.62 → 2043.18] uh, had this guess, uh, a big factor in Netflix price increases are sports broadcasts.
[2043.18 → 2043.38] Oh.
[2043.96 → 2049.14] The move is likely to make it more difficult to stream sports from their phones to large
[2049.14 → 2051.90] audiences in places like pubs, et cetera.
[2051.98 → 2054.26] That's actually a super smart take.
[2054.38 → 2055.92] I would not have thought of that.
[2056.68 → 2057.68] That's like...
[2057.68 → 2060.26] You think there's enough money in, like...
[2060.26 → 2061.00] In sports?
[2061.34 → 2063.44] In pubs having one Netflix subscription?
[2064.10 → 2069.06] Well, no, because if you're in a if you're at a commercial address, they can gate that.
[2069.98 → 2071.50] They can monitor that.
[2071.50 → 2074.14] Whereas if some, if a consumer...
[2074.14 → 2075.22] Is there a different price for that?
[2075.74 → 2076.10] Probably.
[2076.62 → 2078.08] Actually, that's a good question.
[2078.52 → 2079.04] I'm not sure.
[2079.04 → 2079.96] I literally don't know.
[2079.96 → 2080.12] I don't know.
[2080.34 → 2081.92] It wouldn't, because it wouldn't surprise...
[2081.92 → 2086.46] Okay, whether they can gate it by address or by payment method or not, because I can tell
[2086.46 → 2089.22] you right now, a service can tell if you're paying on a corporate card.
[2089.24 → 2091.74] No, they, yeah, they definitely, they could do those things.
[2091.78 → 2092.56] I just don't know if they are.
[2092.56 → 2096.00] If nothing else, they could definitely have different terms and conditions.
[2096.58 → 2096.80] Sure.
[2096.80 → 2100.54] And then they could penalize you if you are violating the terms and conditions.
[2100.54 → 2102.78] Hold on.
[2102.90 → 2104.22] So, yeah, Netflix.
[2105.46 → 2108.26] Oh, oh, right.
[2108.72 → 2113.02] But there's also the acquisition in the background of this.
[2113.32 → 2114.54] The Warner Brothers thing.
[2114.60 → 2114.92] Yeah.
[2115.86 → 2116.38] Okay.
[2116.80 → 2117.44] Oh, man.
[2117.50 → 2120.00] I feel like I got the I feel like I got the pins.
[2120.10 → 2120.46] The strings.
[2120.68 → 2121.78] The pins and the strings.
[2122.02 → 2122.40] The red strings are coming together.
[2122.66 → 2123.76] It's all coming together.
[2124.08 → 2124.84] I'll keep going.
[2124.84 → 2129.76] Again, Netflix told Wired that the real reason for the change is that not enough people
[2129.76 → 2136.44] use the feature, which they are not the only ones that are trying to push people to just
[2136.44 → 2140.30] use built into TV apps instead of casting.
[2140.30 → 2143.98] A lot of users say that that is better.
[2144.54 → 2150.70] I think a lot of those users are kind of missing the point of that your TV is easy to deprecate,
[2150.78 → 2152.74] which I think we're getting into here in a second.
[2153.74 → 2155.86] But either way, we'll get there.
[2156.18 → 2160.94] As a totally unrelated note, you can still cast from Plex or Jellyfin.
[2161.30 → 2165.56] And casting to TVs from VLC has become a much better experience.
[2165.56 → 2177.78] Netflix also announced this morning that they are buying Warner Bros for the total enterprise
[2177.78 → 2183.12] value of $82.7 billion.
[2184.18 → 2189.48] The transaction is expected to complete in Q3, 2026.
[2189.48 → 2198.78] One of the notes here is LMAO, my favourite thing is that Netflix lists as beloved franchise
[2198.78 → 2201.30] The Big Bang Theory that was said by Elijah.
[2201.68 → 2205.36] I mean, I can tell you there are definitely people who beloved The Big Bang Theory.
[2205.36 → 2206.82] There for sure are, actually.
[2207.08 → 2209.84] My grandparents freaking love.
[2209.94 → 2211.70] There's actually a ton of people that really like it.
[2211.72 → 2213.14] And that's also why it got a spinoff.
[2213.38 → 2215.24] I don't disagree with Elijah.
[2215.24 → 2218.34] I'm not necessarily the hugest fan or a fan at all.
[2218.34 → 2220.34] But there is quite a few.
[2220.34 → 2223.70] I don't think there's any benefit to putting our heads in the sand and going,
[2223.88 → 2225.78] I don't like this thing, therefore no one likes it.
[2225.78 → 2227.10] Yeah, for sure a lot of people do.
[2227.16 → 2232.78] Like, I definitely, I see that attitude so much, and it's like, okay, but no.
[2233.42 → 2233.78] Yeah.
[2233.90 → 2234.94] That's not how that works.
[2235.00 → 2238.74] You don't get to decide what other people like or don't like.
[2238.92 → 2239.96] You can disagree.
[2240.76 → 2241.16] 100%.
[2241.16 → 2243.38] Yeah, I don't think it's good entertainment, personally.
[2243.38 → 2246.46] But you don't get to decide that other people do not beloved.
[2246.70 → 2247.68] There are a lot of fans.
[2247.82 → 2248.00] Yeah.
[2248.34 → 2248.68] Yeah.
[2250.22 → 2251.20] Numbers is numbers.
[2251.88 → 2254.02] And math doesn't care what you think at all.
[2254.84 → 2257.00] Jeremian said, holy, this should have been a headline topic.
[2257.08 → 2259.54] I mean, we didn't know about the Warner Brothers thing until after the show started.
[2259.66 → 2260.66] Well, we knew it was rumoured.
[2260.74 → 2263.44] I didn't think it was confirmed yet.
[2263.80 → 2265.14] Did that just get confirmed today?
[2265.86 → 2266.14] Yeah.
[2266.84 → 2267.20] Wow.
[2267.34 → 2268.82] What a bomb to drop.
[2268.98 → 2272.52] Like, what is going to be left of the entertainment industry?
[2272.52 → 2280.98] I don't watch shows much.
[2281.18 → 2281.80] I have no idea.
[2281.80 → 2283.50] Like, it's crazy.
[2283.50 → 2289.50] Like, for a long time there, it was being propped up by, like, cable subscriptions, essentially.
[2289.50 → 2290.76] But those are dying.
[2290.76 → 2291.32] Yeah.
[2291.32 → 2292.66] So then, now what?
[2292.66 → 2298.70] One of the worst things about this stuff is that these types of services tend to kill shows really fast.
[2299.26 → 2299.84] Oh, I know.
[2299.96 → 2301.94] I just don't bother getting into a show anymore.
[2302.16 → 2302.36] Yeah.
[2302.44 → 2304.44] Like, Big Bang Theory is still old TV.
[2305.48 → 2306.42] Like, it's not...
[2306.42 → 2309.58] We're talking something that ran for a really long time, and they got spinoffs.
[2309.76 → 2311.42] I'd even argue...
[2311.42 → 2314.04] Wasn't Breaking Bad old TV as well?
[2314.20 → 2314.44] Mm-hmm.
[2315.18 → 2317.50] I don't think Game of Thrones was...
[2317.50 → 2317.68] Yeah.
[2317.98 → 2318.76] That was a service.
[2318.76 → 2319.54] Well, that was cable.
[2319.70 → 2320.38] That was...
[2320.38 → 2321.00] That was cable?
[2321.12 → 2322.06] I thought that was, like, HBO.
[2322.54 → 2323.18] Yeah, it was HBO.
[2323.40 → 2323.96] Oh, that was cable.
[2324.00 → 2325.44] See, I don't do any of this.
[2325.80 → 2327.20] I'm not a TV guy.
[2328.50 → 2329.26] Yeah, this is wild.
[2329.26 → 2330.78] So, chat's like, yeah.
[2330.82 → 2332.62] What type of shows does Warner Brothers have?
[2332.64 → 2334.54] It's going to be Disney versus Netflix.
[2335.28 → 2335.84] Like...
[2335.84 → 2336.04] Yeah.
[2336.42 → 2341.12] Amazon's going to be in there somewhere just because, I don't know, they have enough money
[2341.12 → 2342.32] to buy the earth and all the heavens.
[2342.94 → 2344.42] Apple...
[2344.42 → 2348.60] Unless they just stop being interested in it...
[2348.60 → 2350.02] I don't know.
[2350.08 → 2356.24] Apple's motivations in the whole traditional media space seem super hard to interpret at
[2356.24 → 2356.68] this point.
[2356.92 → 2365.84] Like, they'll do this sort of vanity sort of crown jewel projects and stuff and then...
[2365.84 → 2367.12] I don't know.
[2367.18 → 2372.38] They don't really seem to go super mainstream because they're kind of locked down in terms
[2372.38 → 2373.50] of access to them.
[2373.58 → 2376.26] And so, they don't really get that much buzz.
[2376.34 → 2376.72] And then...
[2376.72 → 2377.40] I don't know.
[2377.48 → 2379.48] They just seem to be kind of spinning their wheels over there.
[2379.48 → 2380.48] Okay.
[2380.48 → 2381.48] I don't know.
[2381.48 → 2381.54] Okay.
[2381.68 → 2385.80] So, DC Comics is part of Warner Brothers' IP.
[2386.80 → 2387.20] Uh-huh.
[2387.60 → 2387.94] Dang.
[2387.94 → 2391.76] What else?
[2391.84 → 2392.64] What else is in there?
[2392.64 → 2394.62] I mean, Ani maniacs, I assume.
[2394.90 → 2395.50] Harry Potter?
[2395.88 → 2396.16] Yeah.
[2396.32 → 2396.58] Okay.
[2396.66 → 2397.72] Harry Potter's a big one.
[2397.72 → 2406.38] I mean, honestly, Harry Potter is probably, depending on how they play their cards, probably worth
[2406.38 → 2409.08] the cost of admission alone.
[2409.54 → 2411.08] Just in terms of how much...
[2411.08 → 2412.00] I don't know how much people watch the new stuff.
[2412.56 → 2413.06] Oh, dude.
[2413.14 → 2414.60] It's not even that.
[2414.72 → 2415.96] It's like the games...
[2415.96 → 2417.18] Just the volume of...
[2417.18 → 2418.38] Well, the games, yeah.
[2418.76 → 2421.06] Whatever that game was sold like crazy.
[2421.18 → 2422.06] With that said, I...
[2422.06 → 2422.86] I don't want to talk about it.
[2422.86 → 2425.06] Like, I don't know what Rowling's take is, though.
[2425.40 → 2431.26] So, I don't know how profitable the Potter verse is compared to, you know, the IPs that they
[2431.26 → 2431.70] own outright.
[2431.70 → 2432.08] Not a single clue.
[2433.96 → 2435.92] How much does...
[2435.92 → 2437.64] The Lego film franchise, apparently.
[2437.78 → 2438.58] That's...
[2438.58 → 2441.92] I doubt that that's in perpetuity, though.
[2442.36 → 2447.42] Like, I'm sure the Lego company gave themselves room to negotiate moving their IP to someone
[2447.42 → 2448.52] else if they really want to.
[2448.66 → 2449.56] Feels like something...
[2449.56 → 2450.58] Lord of the Rings, though.
[2450.58 → 2455.00] So, okay, but the Lord of the Rings one is complicated because Warner Brothers owns the
[2455.00 → 2459.68] rights to, like, the Lord of the Rings, but then there was the whole thing with Amazon
[2459.68 → 2465.48] and that, like, Rings of Power show where, like, different parts of the timeline could
[2465.48 → 2468.68] maybe be licensed to someone else, and that whole thing was pretty complicated.
[2468.94 → 2472.56] If they felt like completely redoing The Hobbit, that'd be pretty sick.
[2473.10 → 2473.30] Oh.
[2473.30 → 2474.54] Make it one movie instead of three.
[2474.60 → 2476.26] Yeah, that'd be amazing.
[2476.26 → 2479.26] That'd be cool with just deleting that from memory.
[2479.26 → 2481.06] Oh, so bad.
[2481.14 → 2482.02] That'd be totally fine.
[2482.16 → 2482.94] So bad.
[2483.28 → 2484.82] Just one movie instead of three.
[2485.16 → 2486.24] Make it long.
[2486.54 → 2488.98] Have the extended edition be, like, four hours.
[2489.08 → 2489.38] Sure.
[2490.24 → 2491.10] But just...
[2491.10 → 2491.32] Yeah.
[2491.66 → 2494.66] The Lord of the Rings books, it was one movie per book.
[2495.26 → 2496.28] The Hobbit is a shorter book.
[2497.06 → 2497.96] 23 books.
[2498.08 → 2502.98] Tone Kibble says it's really weird because there's a UK publisher that can sell Harry Potter books
[2502.98 → 2507.06] in the UK and Europe, but not in the USA because someone else owns the rights to sell it there,
[2507.14 → 2509.08] so who knows how this counts for J. K. Rowling.
[2509.24 → 2510.76] That's actually a perfect point.
[2511.54 → 2520.38] In, like, in IP ownership and licensing, you can end up with really convoluted structures
[2520.38 → 2528.26] because the whole thing is built up at a time when it's not worth anything in many cases,
[2528.44 → 2535.94] and then the whole multi-billions and billions and billions of dollars empire thing comes later.
[2536.26 → 2543.16] So someone who got in early with a certain slice of rights might have negotiated a perfect deal
[2543.16 → 2547.26] back when it wasn't worth anything, and that might end up needing to be grandfathered in
[2547.26 → 2550.50] and worked around, so the whole thing can get super complicated.
[2551.32 → 2555.94] And look, chat, your feelings on J. K. Rowling are sort of irrelevant here
[2555.94 → 2557.84] because we're talking about money.
[2558.04 → 2558.24] Yeah.
[2558.64 → 2566.50] And whether you like Harry Potter or you think he should have been a Slytherin or whatever, right,
[2566.86 → 2569.74] doesn't change that money.
[2570.74 → 2575.26] Like, dude, Yvonne and I were over in...
[2575.26 → 2576.28] Okay, one sec.
[2576.28 → 2578.50] Like, Lower or something.
[2578.90 → 2580.06] In the Philippine chat said,
[2580.18 → 2585.58] WB had distribution for the big movies, but Amazon bought the entire IP from the Tolkien family.
[2585.70 → 2586.56] Okay, there you go then.
[2586.68 → 2589.70] Assuming that's true, that lays things out a little bit.
[2591.36 → 2595.40] Anyway, yeah, so we were over in London last year, Yvonne and I,
[2595.40 → 2603.20] and we were just walking around, and there was this entire store that was just Harry Potter.
[2603.46 → 2603.58] Yeah.
[2603.58 → 2604.58] Also...
[2604.58 → 2605.24] It's a massive industry.
[2605.24 → 2607.02] We were at Disneyland and...
[2607.02 → 2608.24] Or was it Disneyland or Universal?
[2608.42 → 2608.88] I can't remember.
[2608.98 → 2610.00] Whichever one has, like...
[2610.00 → 2610.50] That game.
[2610.64 → 2612.50] I constantly can't remember the name of it.
[2612.52 → 2612.54] Harry Potter and...
[2612.54 → 2612.88] Potter's Legacy.
[2613.00 → 2613.24] Yeah.
[2613.42 → 2613.56] Yeah.
[2613.56 → 2617.26] It was one of the best-selling games the year it came out, just no one talked about it.
[2617.34 → 2617.56] Yeah.
[2617.64 → 2618.96] But it sold like crazy.
[2619.10 → 2619.98] Sold like billion.
[2620.24 → 2620.44] Yeah.
[2620.44 → 2624.96] So we're just talking about how much they paid for this acquisition.
[2624.96 → 2625.46] Dollar, dollar, dollar.
[2625.46 → 2625.60] Yeah.
[2625.72 → 2629.76] And how much money they're likely to be able to make on it in the longer term.
[2629.82 → 2630.96] Netflix is gonna...
[2633.08 → 2633.90] Disney's...
[2633.90 → 2636.56] Someone said Netflix is worth 2.5 times Disney.
[2636.64 → 2636.92] It's nuts.
[2637.16 → 2639.36] Yeah, Disney's just getting raked by everyone right now, though.
[2639.40 → 2639.92] Like...
[2639.92 → 2642.06] And I said raked, just to be clear.
[2642.74 → 2645.34] Didn't their last Pixar film just, like...
[2645.34 → 2645.84] Tank?
[2646.06 → 2650.30] Their thing forever has been kids stuff, right?
[2650.38 → 2653.10] They get you interested at the beginning, and then they keep you interested forever.
[2653.24 → 2655.92] But then the adults are super into, like, Disney stuff.
[2656.16 → 2658.24] And Bluey is just dunking them, dude.
[2659.56 → 2663.86] On the like, actually, like, kids shows end, Bluey's dunking on everybody.
[2665.14 → 2666.44] So, yeah.
[2666.76 → 2668.64] Disney...
[2668.64 → 2671.62] Feels like they're falling behind a little bit.
[2672.06 → 2675.90] Disney just announced that they are re-showing Endgame in theatres.
[2679.20 → 2679.60] What?
[2682.68 → 2683.90] That's wild, actually.
[2683.90 → 2684.64] That's kind of sad.
[2685.18 → 2686.20] You know what's really...
[2686.20 → 2688.90] I don't hear anyone talk about the Marvel movies anymore.
[2689.00 → 2689.52] Any of the new ones.
[2689.52 → 2690.20] Oh, dude, no.
[2690.30 → 2690.88] Well, who cares?
[2691.02 → 2691.88] No one cares at all.
[2692.08 → 2693.64] Eternals just killed it for me.
[2694.18 → 2695.92] I don't even know what that is.
[2696.04 → 2697.12] It was so bad.
[2697.48 → 2698.98] It was just unwatchable.
[2699.18 → 2699.38] Yeah.
[2699.38 → 2703.42] They tried to introduce, like, nine new characters.
[2703.72 → 2704.22] Oh, boy.
[2704.32 → 2706.80] None of it made any sense in, like...
[2706.80 → 2709.80] And look, I'm not...
[2709.80 → 2713.52] I guarantee you, I am not the most insufferable...
[2713.52 → 2713.86] Mm-mm.
[2713.86 → 2717.30] But actually the canon person in your life.
[2718.00 → 2719.20] But I care...
[2719.20 → 2727.64] I care that you care enough to at least make an attempt to help me with my suspension of
[2727.64 → 2728.34] disbelief here.
[2728.76 → 2730.18] Like, that's what I care about.
[2730.32 → 2733.62] Lord of the Rings movies had a bunch of stuff happen in it that didn't happen in the books.
[2733.76 → 2736.16] But it felt truthful to the books.
[2736.32 → 2737.58] It felt honest to the books.
[2737.58 → 2742.86] And it was truthful to its own rules that it established.
[2743.10 → 2743.56] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2743.62 → 2750.00] So the issue with Eternals is that it basically took everything that had happened up until
[2750.00 → 2752.46] that point, which included, like, Endgame and stuff.
[2752.66 → 2756.26] Like, universe-level annihilation shit, right?
[2756.60 → 2762.18] And was like, yeah, these guys, they're so powerful that they could have prevented it
[2762.18 → 2762.50] all.
[2762.80 → 2764.18] But they were sleeping.
[2764.18 → 2767.48] It's like, what are you even talking about?
[2768.18 → 2769.54] Like, that's so stupid.
[2769.78 → 2770.62] That's just lame.
[2770.70 → 2772.52] Don't disrespect me like that.
[2772.80 → 2774.24] There's different, like...
[2774.24 → 2774.66] Oh, man.
[2774.72 → 2777.02] Like, I've heard about The Witcher show.
[2777.14 → 2777.82] I never watched it.
[2777.84 → 2785.66] But I heard that it was, like, very difficult to keep the showrunners, like, on lore.
[2786.78 → 2786.94] Yeah.
[2787.10 → 2788.90] I've heard that about a bunch of different things.
[2789.36 → 2792.18] Well, it's because everyone has their own, like, ego, right?
[2792.18 → 2792.40] Yeah.
[2792.40 → 2794.54] And they want to put their own fingerprints on it.
[2794.54 → 2798.60] But then with, like, Lord of the Rings, you hear about how the cast and the director and
[2798.60 → 2801.02] everyone was, like, would basically walk around set with the books.
[2802.02 → 2802.18] Yeah.
[2802.18 → 2804.84] And would just, like, constantly be reading and try to figure out what their character
[2804.84 → 2805.76] would do in different scenarios.
[2805.76 → 2809.86] It's almost like you acquired the source material for a reason.
[2809.98 → 2810.24] Yeah.
[2810.42 → 2810.66] Right?
[2810.76 → 2812.66] And, like, you don't have to stick to it perfectly.
[2812.80 → 2813.40] It's a movie.
[2813.52 → 2816.66] You have to change some things to keep pace up and do all these other kinds of things.
[2816.66 → 2822.10] But as long as you're, like, trying to do it justice, it's a completely different scenario.
[2822.28 → 2822.36] Yeah.
[2822.86 → 2826.04] And to be clear, there are cases.
[2826.48 → 2830.92] There are cases where dramatic changes can be made to the source IP.
[2831.00 → 2831.12] Yeah.
[2831.12 → 2832.90] And you can still end up with a great product.
[2833.00 → 2833.16] Totally.
[2833.16 → 2836.38] How to Train Your Dragon is the example I always come back to.
[2836.52 → 2836.68] Yeah.
[2836.68 → 2837.16] Okay.
[2837.94 → 2844.06] Toothless, in the How to Train Your Dragon novels, okay, Toothless is, like, this big.
[2845.42 → 2852.98] And at the very beginning, the humans and dragons coexist, and the dragons are, like, basically
[2852.98 → 2855.54] have the role of, like, dogs in their universe.
[2855.76 → 2858.88] Wasn't it, like, the author, like, supported the changes or whatever?
[2859.16 → 2860.02] Something like that.
[2860.02 → 2860.68] Yeah, she helped.
[2860.80 → 2862.72] Yeah, which is, like, that's also awesome.
[2862.72 → 2868.26] But How to Train Your Dragon won, which, other than the main character being named Hiccup,
[2868.84 → 2874.24] and his dragon being named Toothless, and his dad being named Stoic, like, other than names,
[2874.62 → 2881.20] and that it was, like, Viking-themed, has nothing to do with the first novel of How to Train Your Dragon.
[2881.40 → 2882.82] And it is a perfect movie.
[2883.54 → 2884.24] Literally perfect.
[2885.08 → 2890.90] I will go on record saying How to Train Your Dragon, the first animated film, is a perfect movie.
[2890.90 → 2893.44] It's unfortunate that you have to say the first animated film.
[2893.60 → 2895.18] I know, it's tough, isn't it?
[2895.18 → 2895.42] Yeah.
[2895.56 → 2896.46] Yeah, it's a hard life.
[2896.56 → 2897.32] It's a hard life.
[2900.52 → 2905.38] Anyway, the point is that Kathleen Kennedy needs to go.
[2907.60 → 2908.16] Yeah.
[2908.54 → 2910.90] How is she still employed?
[2911.50 → 2912.60] I have no idea, dude.
[2912.94 → 2913.80] It's so strange.
[2913.92 → 2917.14] She squandered, like, the world's most recognizable IP.
[2917.14 → 2921.44] I genuinely think, like, that mentality is why Disney's dying.
[2922.16 → 2923.04] Like, that should have been so...
[2923.04 → 2929.18] The fact that the new Star Wars series was allowed to be made, even sort of in the way that it was made,
[2930.08 → 2930.60] is...
[2930.60 → 2933.02] It must be a...
[2933.02 → 2937.20] I don't even know if it's fair to say micro, but microcosm of why Disney's dying in general.
[2937.38 → 2942.06] And the fact that that is still allowed to continue is like,
[2942.24 → 2943.42] yeah, you guys are just screwed.
[2943.42 → 2947.74] Like, I don't know if leadership is just asleep or what's going on, but like...
[2947.74 → 2949.66] Who does she have pictures of?
[2949.78 → 2951.94] And what animal are they f***ING?
[2954.20 → 2955.64] That's what I need to know.
[2960.64 → 2963.52] I wish they could have heard the uncensored version of that.
[2965.60 → 2968.16] I think that was probably funny anyway,
[2968.16 → 2970.60] but hearing that fully uncensored was great.
[2970.60 → 2974.64] Oh, man.
[2975.46 → 2976.74] J.H. Com says,
[2976.84 → 2978.20] Mandalorian was great, though.
[2978.46 → 2980.14] I only watched the first season.
[2980.74 → 2982.98] It was great relative...
[2982.98 → 2983.22] Yeah.
[2983.34 → 2984.30] ...to what we'd been getting.
[2984.42 → 2984.68] Yeah.
[2985.18 → 2986.42] I completely agree.
[2986.54 → 2987.42] I enjoyed it.
[2987.56 → 2988.80] We were that desperate.
[2989.06 → 2990.70] But a lot of watching it,
[2990.80 → 2992.94] I couldn't get the brain worm out
[2992.94 → 2994.84] that was like...
[2994.84 → 2997.64] If the other stuff was like as good as it could have been,
[2997.64 → 2998.68] this would have been mediocre.
[2998.90 → 3000.68] I couldn't get that out of my head.
[3001.06 → 3002.02] Dee Bollinger says,
[3002.10 → 3003.62] Kathleen Kennedy pushed for Landor,
[3003.68 → 3004.52] which is apparently good.
[3004.56 → 3005.16] I haven't watched it yet.
[3005.16 → 3006.44] I've heard very good things about Landor.
[3006.46 → 3008.78] And apparently the issues with Rise of Skywalker
[3008.78 → 3011.10] are known to be pushed by Bob Iger,
[3011.30 → 3012.36] not Kathleen Kennedy.
[3013.02 → 3013.56] Well then,
[3013.84 → 3014.60] oh my God,
[3014.68 → 3015.60] he's back too.
[3015.94 → 3017.00] What are they going to do?
[3017.00 → 3021.58] She overlooked the renewed trilogy thing.
[3022.18 → 3022.36] Yeah,
[3022.48 → 3023.34] that was...
[3023.34 → 3024.06] That's enough.
[3024.54 → 3024.86] Yeah.
[3024.90 → 3026.94] I can appreciate that she's maybe,
[3027.10 → 3027.64] I don't know,
[3027.84 → 3029.14] done good things since then.
[3030.42 → 3032.14] That should have never been allowed to happen
[3032.14 → 3032.84] in the first place.
[3033.02 → 3034.94] Who was responsible for Solo's story?
[3035.76 → 3037.40] Because that was pretty bad.
[3039.82 → 3040.76] I have no idea.
[3042.14 → 3042.46] Ugh.
[3044.86 → 3045.54] All right.
[3045.54 → 3046.20] Well, anyway,
[3046.50 → 3047.98] good luck, Netflix,
[3048.16 → 3050.76] with your new acquisition.
[3051.54 → 3056.58] I hope that you are good to us consumers
[3056.58 → 3058.82] whose wallets you milk for profit.
[3058.98 → 3059.30] I was going to say,
[3059.38 → 3060.84] and they won't be.
[3061.12 → 3061.72] I know.
[3061.86 → 3064.06] Which was like proven by the beginning of this topic.
[3065.18 → 3065.66] And like,
[3065.82 → 3066.16] yeah,
[3066.32 → 3067.26] no more casting.
[3067.88 → 3069.02] I got to be honest with you,
[3069.14 → 3070.08] I don't cast.
[3070.18 → 3072.34] I use the native apps on everything that I watch Netflix on.
[3072.34 → 3074.12] I don't think that statement that they said
[3074.12 → 3075.66] is super far from the truth.
[3075.78 → 3077.72] I think it's just convenient for them.
[3077.94 → 3078.76] That's the problem.
[3078.96 → 3079.24] Yeah.
[3079.34 → 3079.90] The timing,
[3080.12 → 3083.06] the timing does look very convenient,
[3083.20 → 3083.66] doesn't it?
[3083.80 → 3084.00] Yeah.
[3085.56 → 3085.92] Aha.
[3086.08 → 3087.40] One of our discussion questions
[3087.40 → 3089.40] we did not talk about
[3089.40 → 3092.46] is what streaming service is worth paying for.
[3092.46 → 3094.04] I don't pay for any of them.
[3095.60 → 3095.96] Um,
[3096.12 → 3096.68] I'm,
[3096.68 → 3097.18] I'm going to,
[3097.36 → 3097.78] you know what?
[3098.54 → 3099.10] YouTube premium.
[3099.82 → 3100.18] Oh,
[3100.26 → 3100.44] okay.
[3100.52 → 3100.86] Fair enough.
[3100.88 → 3102.20] I think YouTube premium is worth it.
[3102.24 → 3102.52] Is that a
[3102.72 → 3104.56] it's a streaming service.
[3104.62 → 3104.96] You stream
[3104.96 → 3106.42] and it's a service.
[3106.66 → 3106.96] Yeah.
[3106.96 → 3109.74] And it includes all the music you can eat.
[3110.38 → 3110.78] Yeah.
[3111.58 → 3112.50] That part's pretty good.
[3112.92 → 3113.16] Like,
[3113.32 → 3114.88] I don't think I,
[3115.02 → 3115.18] okay.
[3115.18 → 3115.92] So I agree with you.
[3115.98 → 3117.20] I think YouTube premium is sick.
[3117.26 → 3118.36] I've been subscribed to it for many,
[3118.48 → 3118.88] many years.
[3119.34 → 3122.04] We gain from saying this in a way,
[3122.04 → 3124.86] because if you watch our stuff with YouTube premium,
[3124.86 → 3125.82] we get more money.
[3125.96 → 3126.00] Oh,
[3126.02 → 3129.14] we gain from it directly to the people who are watching right now.
[3129.24 → 3129.46] Yes.
[3130.40 → 3131.48] Unless they're on full plane,
[3131.60 → 3131.80] LOL.
[3131.80 → 3132.72] Um,
[3132.88 → 3134.76] but another quality streaming service,
[3134.90 → 3135.46] but yeah,
[3135.58 → 3135.88] hell.
[3136.02 → 3136.38] I mean,
[3136.40 → 3136.60] yeah,
[3136.60 → 3137.22] there you go.
[3137.30 → 3137.76] That's a
[3137.84 → 3138.90] that one worth.
[3138.90 → 3140.80] It is very subjective for that one though.
[3140.88 → 3141.10] I mean,
[3141.14 → 3141.42] yes,
[3141.54 → 3142.22] the worth is,
[3142.34 → 3142.52] Hey,
[3142.64 → 3144.18] like there are the exclusives.
[3144.36 → 3145.62] We really appreciate you guys.
[3145.62 → 3146.66] We've got exclusives.
[3146.66 → 3149.10] You get early access to deals a couple of times a year.
[3149.58 → 3149.98] Um,
[3150.04 → 3150.80] but you know that,
[3151.00 → 3151.44] but I'm not,
[3151.54 → 3152.58] we're not saying all of this.
[3152.58 → 3153.16] That's not really,
[3153.30 → 3154.70] it's not really a streaming service.
[3154.70 → 3155.36] It's more like a
[3155.42 → 3156.36] it's more like a Patreon.
[3156.62 → 3159.82] It's more like an in-house Patreon for a content creator that you like.
[3159.88 → 3161.78] It's not because you,
[3161.80 → 3162.00] you,
[3162.08 → 3163.90] you don't subscribe to the service.
[3164.98 → 3168.72] You give a monthly payment to individual creators on flow plane.
[3168.82 → 3169.22] In that case,
[3169.30 → 3169.80] sauce plus.
[3170.36 → 3170.70] Um,
[3170.72 → 3170.98] yeah.
[3171.02 → 3171.28] Okay.
[3171.28 → 3172.02] Sauce plus pretty,
[3172.02 → 3173.58] pretty cool service.
[3173.58 → 3174.12] There we go.
[3174.46 → 3174.86] Um,
[3174.86 → 3175.36] but anyway,
[3175.36 → 3176.86] all of that isn't for,
[3176.94 → 3178.28] for personal benefits stuff.
[3178.60 → 3179.08] I,
[3179.16 → 3183.30] I don't subscribe to basically any of those platforms.
[3183.42 → 3187.92] And the reason why I don't is that I don't like not owning my stuff.
[3187.92 → 3188.38] Sure.
[3188.86 → 3189.28] Flow plane.
[3189.76 → 3190.24] Uh,
[3190.24 → 3195.58] if the creator decides you can download the content.
[3195.82 → 3197.04] I'm going to be honest with you.
[3197.32 → 3203.34] I have a Netflix subscription and maybe this won't be a popular take with some people.
[3203.76 → 3208.16] I just shamelessly download any Netflix shows and I put them on my Plex.
[3208.84 → 3209.36] Yeah.
[3209.38 → 3209.56] Cool.
[3209.56 → 3211.72] I pay my premium subscription every month.
[3212.00 → 3214.40] They are not getting their like viewer tracking from me,
[3214.46 → 3216.96] which is part of the value for them.
[3217.36 → 3217.68] Um,
[3217.90 → 3219.34] I thought their download thing,
[3219.42 → 3222.58] like downloaded it into a like closed version of the
[3222.66 → 3222.92] is there,
[3223.00 → 3223.06] Oh,
[3223.06 → 3223.66] I don't use that.
[3223.78 → 3224.18] Okay.
[3224.24 → 3224.60] Got it.
[3224.60 → 3224.78] Yep.
[3224.98 → 3225.28] All right.
[3225.46 → 3225.66] Yeah.
[3225.78 → 3226.10] Yeah.
[3226.64 → 3227.36] So I just,
[3227.48 → 3231.70] I shamelessly pirate the Netflix shows that I give them money for.
[3231.70 → 3232.12] Nice.
[3232.18 → 3233.10] So I just don't,
[3233.22 → 3234.46] I don't care at that point.
[3234.46 → 3235.16] And like,
[3235.54 → 3235.94] yeah,
[3236.08 → 3241.40] I know that I'm only subscribing to a license to watch them while I'm paying the subscription.
[3241.86 → 3242.34] But,
[3242.46 → 3242.86] um,
[3243.46 → 3243.78] no,
[3244.22 → 3244.70] like that,
[3244.76 → 3244.96] that,
[3245.08 → 3246.86] that's the point where I'm just like,
[3246.88 → 3248.12] I'm good with it.
[3248.12 → 3248.56] Yeah.
[3248.62 → 3249.04] Um,
[3249.04 → 3249.86] same for Amazon.
[3249.86 → 3253.18] I'll download an Amazon show without one moment's hesitation.
[3253.38 → 3254.36] I have a prime subscription.
[3254.98 → 3255.38] Um,
[3255.42 → 3255.66] I'm,
[3255.68 → 3258.12] I'm not proud to have a prime subscription these days.
[3258.24 → 3258.48] Yeah,
[3258.48 → 3258.70] sure.
[3258.82 → 3259.88] Like honestly,
[3260.56 → 3261.14] um,
[3261.66 → 3264.18] but sometimes it's,
[3264.24 → 3265.14] it's very convenient.
[3265.14 → 3266.46] I do go out of my way.
[3266.56 → 3270.56] I remember talking to you about this a while back before I buy something on Amazon,
[3270.56 → 3273.28] I will search, and I'll try to find it elsewhere.
[3273.28 → 3275.10] Like I needed to buy some rollerblade wheels.
[3275.26 → 3275.64] I got,
[3275.70 → 3277.16] I got trapped this whole day.
[3277.34 → 3280.64] $80 in shipping to buy rollerblade wheels.
[3280.64 → 3285.32] But the craziest part is to get quality wheels on Amazon was like impossible anyway.
[3285.78 → 3286.08] Yeah.
[3286.16 → 3287.60] So I did search both.
[3288.70 → 3289.80] And I was just like,
[3289.84 → 3290.30] you know what?
[3290.36 → 3290.52] No,
[3290.60 → 3294.56] this is why I search other sites because I want a quality product.
[3294.58 → 3297.18] And because I wanted to support someone other than Amazon,
[3297.38 → 3300.42] that's the fact that I'm paying $80 in shipping.
[3300.54 → 3301.86] Did it come from Europe or something?
[3301.86 → 3302.12] No.
[3302.36 → 3304.78] Shipping is just really expensive for small businesses.
[3305.06 → 3310.40] That's something that a lot of people don't realize anymore because Amazon,
[3310.40 → 3314.32] Amazon completely changed people's perception of what shipping costs.
[3314.54 → 3314.70] It is nuts.
[3315.04 → 3315.26] Yeah.
[3315.60 → 3316.72] It is crazy.
[3317.02 → 3317.22] I,
[3317.26 → 3317.68] I got,
[3317.76 → 3318.48] I got trapped.
[3318.62 → 3320.32] I had to buy something off Amazon recently.
[3320.52 → 3321.44] I like,
[3321.80 → 3323.00] I'm not trying to project you guys,
[3323.04 → 3323.58] do whatever you want.
[3323.66 → 3328.14] I try to really like basically never shop from Amazon.
[3328.42 → 3336.92] There was a Christmas list thing, and it included an item that is sold literally only on Amazon.
[3337.08 → 3337.52] Really?
[3337.70 → 3338.98] You can't buy it directly from the company.
[3338.98 → 3339.38] Kindle?
[3339.54 → 3340.04] You can't buy,
[3340.08 → 3341.14] it was a specific book.
[3341.72 → 3342.04] Oh.
[3342.12 → 3344.46] You can't buy it directly from the publisher or something.
[3344.60 → 3344.90] You can't,
[3344.96 → 3346.28] no other bookstore had it.
[3346.68 → 3347.22] It was.
[3347.34 → 3347.66] Wild.
[3348.04 → 3348.38] Rare.
[3348.66 → 3350.24] I tried to buy it from like Indigo.
[3350.48 → 3351.96] They listed it on their site,
[3352.06 → 3355.18] but it was zero in any store and zero online.
[3355.64 → 3355.96] Huh.
[3356.08 → 3356.66] So it was like,
[3356.80 → 3357.34] okay.
[3357.92 → 3358.34] Neat.
[3358.52 → 3358.98] I just,
[3359.12 → 3359.70] I can't.
[3360.40 → 3361.30] I asked like,
[3361.36 → 3363.14] I called a couple local bookstores.
[3363.24 → 3364.02] Nobody had it.
[3364.02 → 3367.18] I think it's just like not a super well-known book.
[3367.28 → 3367.42] What?
[3367.56 → 3368.40] Is it a good book?
[3368.70 → 3369.28] I have no idea.
[3369.50 → 3369.66] Oh.
[3369.90 → 3370.36] Not for me.
[3370.58 → 3370.78] Right.
[3370.86 → 3371.00] Yeah.
[3371.00 → 3371.18] Yeah.
[3371.52 → 3372.64] Not a single clue.
[3372.72 → 3373.46] Never heard of it before.
[3374.58 → 3374.98] Hopefully.
[3374.98 → 3377.12] It was asked for.
[3378.56 → 3379.38] But yeah.
[3379.56 → 3379.94] So I,
[3379.94 → 3380.22] I,
[3380.26 → 3380.84] I just,
[3381.00 → 3381.84] Amazon was the publisher.
[3381.96 → 3382.22] No,
[3382.54 → 3383.70] not quite,
[3384.26 → 3384.80] but I,
[3384.80 → 3384.94] I,
[3384.98 → 3385.12] yeah,
[3385.34 → 3386.34] I couldn't get anywhere else.
[3386.38 → 3386.90] So I was like,
[3386.96 → 3387.18] okay,
[3387.24 → 3387.52] well,
[3388.20 → 3388.70] that's rough.
[3388.88 → 3389.14] Yeah.
[3389.70 → 3391.32] He gave money to daddy Bezos.
[3391.66 → 3392.02] I did.
[3392.02 → 3397.52] He is now part of the solution to putting a penis rocket into orbit.
[3397.86 → 3399.14] Not much of the solution,
[3399.54 → 3400.24] but you're part of it.
[3400.30 → 3400.74] But part of it.
[3400.78 → 3401.36] You're part of it.
[3401.44 → 3402.38] One of us.
[3402.62 → 3403.62] One of us.
[3404.02 → 3404.72] That's the tip.
[3404.98 → 3405.70] I,
[3405.70 → 3406.18] I didn't.
[3408.62 → 3409.06] Bing.
[3409.78 → 3410.26] Yeah.
[3410.92 → 3411.40] Exactly.
[3411.74 → 3412.44] I tried,
[3412.50 → 3413.22] I tried to like,
[3413.46 → 3414.50] I don't know.
[3414.60 → 3418.08] I didn't want to make my little crusade against doing that.
[3418.24 → 3419.80] Break the bonds of earth to,
[3419.80 → 3421.64] to touch the tip of God.
[3424.88 → 3425.48] There's that,
[3425.54 → 3426.50] you know that like,
[3426.50 → 3429.84] but they like reach past.
[3431.40 → 3432.64] Give a little tickle.
[3432.64 → 3435.70] You know,
[3436.00 → 3437.70] humanity is truly lost.
[3439.32 → 3440.36] Not only,
[3440.48 → 3443.46] not only are we like limp arming and not really trying,
[3443.66 → 3445.32] but instead we're reaching back.
[3445.40 → 3445.60] Yeah.
[3445.60 → 3448.96] We won't properly reach out to touch the
[3448.96 → 3449.56] the hand,
[3449.72 → 3449.98] but we,
[3450.06 → 3450.40] you know,
[3450.48 → 3452.00] wash it first.
[3452.10 → 3452.82] Oh man.
[3452.94 → 3453.98] But late at night.
[3454.24 → 3456.00] And then a little light spooning after.
[3459.60 → 3460.00] No,
[3460.06 → 3462.62] but you seem to really love Jesus.
[3462.90 → 3464.24] You see like the
[3464.40 → 3465.30] I don't even remember who it is,
[3465.32 → 3465.60] but the
[3465.60 → 3468.26] the guy like just partially holding his hand out,
[3468.26 → 3470.50] like enables private browsing.
[3473.90 → 3474.90] All right.
[3474.96 → 3475.40] Anyway,
[3475.62 → 3478.20] we're supposed to explain merch messages.
[3478.78 → 3479.16] Hey,
[3479.38 → 3479.90] um,
[3480.10 → 3481.86] if you don't know what merch messages are,
[3481.92 → 3483.86] they're the way to interact with the WAN show.
[3484.00 → 3488.16] We do not want you guys just throwing money at your screen.
[3488.40 → 3488.78] Um,
[3489.04 → 3489.40] we,
[3489.54 → 3492.84] we want to work for you to throw money at your screen.
[3492.84 → 3495.78] We want to give you something of value in return.
[3496.20 → 3498.36] And what did we come up with this week?
[3499.18 → 3499.96] Oh boy.
[3500.12 → 3502.06] Did we ever come up with something?
[3502.16 → 3502.30] Luke,
[3502.36 → 3503.54] do you want to fire up the site?
[3503.80 → 3504.08] Sure.
[3505.38 → 3505.70] Oh,
[3505.80 → 3506.00] right.
[3506.04 → 3506.72] I was going to explain.
[3506.82 → 3508.48] So if you're going to throw money at your screen during the WAN show,
[3508.54 → 3509.64] you do it with a merch message.
[3509.70 → 3511.02] You add something to your cart.
[3511.26 → 3511.62] Uh,
[3511.66 → 3511.90] here,
[3512.02 → 3512.28] I'll,
[3512.34 → 3513.10] I'll show you how to do it.
[3513.20 → 3514.08] So much going on.
[3514.22 → 3514.42] Uh,
[3514.42 → 3515.58] you add something to your cart.
[3516.48 → 3516.80] Sorry.
[3516.88 → 3517.18] One sec.
[3517.28 → 3518.44] There's just so much going on.
[3518.58 → 3520.80] And then you'll see the merch message interface.
[3520.88 → 3521.76] We are live.
[3521.76 → 3522.82] You can leave a merch message.
[3522.90 → 3524.48] It could look like whatever you want.
[3524.54 → 3525.12] Something like this.
[3525.16 → 3525.78] You set a colour.
[3526.02 → 3527.62] You set whether you want to make your name appear.
[3527.72 → 3528.38] You want it to be anonymous.
[3528.66 → 3534.40] And then you go ahead and place your order for whatever it is that tickles your fancy.
[3537.08 → 3538.92] Then it will go to producer Dan,
[3539.58 → 3540.34] who is,
[3540.40 → 3540.60] oh,
[3540.70 → 3541.80] who is joined today.
[3542.20 → 3542.42] Uh,
[3542.44 → 3543.22] it'll go to producer.
[3543.38 → 3543.48] Oh,
[3543.48 → 3543.74] sorry.
[3543.82 → 3544.22] I missed you.
[3544.30 → 3544.60] There it goes.
[3544.66 → 3544.94] Go ahead.
[3545.26 → 3545.40] Oh,
[3545.48 → 3545.62] no,
[3545.68 → 3546.26] I got you again.
[3547.84 → 3548.50] There we go.
[3549.46 → 3550.80] It'll go to producer Dan,
[3550.90 → 3551.50] who will,
[3551.50 → 3551.90] uh,
[3551.90 → 3557.96] pop it up down here or reply to it or who will curate it for me and Luke to respond to.
[3558.06 → 3559.76] We're going to show you what that looks like in a second.
[3559.84 → 3560.36] But first,
[3560.50 → 3563.76] let's talk about something you might want to pick up with your merch message.
[3563.90 → 3568.48] We just launched our cats versus gamers collection, and they are way too fun.
[3568.48 → 3578.26] Our new underwear prints are here with the pixel perfect set featuring a pixel perfect print,
[3578.62 → 3581.90] a solid turquoise and a cat paws pattern.
[3582.42 → 3582.58] Uh,
[3582.58 → 3583.86] can you get me a closeup on that?
[3584.04 → 3584.34] Yeah.
[3584.54 → 3584.70] Oh,
[3584.84 → 3585.50] isn't it so cute?
[3585.56 → 3586.60] Look at all the little kitties.
[3586.72 → 3587.80] Can you maybe go closer,
[3587.94 → 3588.16] Luke?
[3588.38 → 3589.36] Maybe give it the old zoom.
[3590.12 → 3592.94] They got the paw prints and there's little kitties on computers.
[3593.10 → 3593.72] They're so cute.
[3593.72 → 3594.16] Uh,
[3594.16 → 3598.24] we also have the game on set,
[3598.24 → 3600.20] which features a
[3600.20 → 3600.46] uh,
[3600.50 → 3601.34] hold on.
[3601.58 → 3601.94] Uh,
[3602.02 → 3603.36] a game on print,
[3603.36 → 3608.34] a solid black and a throwback arcade design.
[3608.54 → 3610.78] If you haven't tried our underwear yet,
[3610.88 → 3612.50] they are super comfy.
[3612.66 → 3615.42] Thanks to a modal rayon blend that is soft,
[3615.60 → 3615.94] silky,
[3616.06 → 3619.38] breathable and stretchy enough for all day wear.
[3619.50 → 3619.98] Thank goodness.
[3619.98 → 3622.04] Because if you only wore your underwear for part of the day,
[3622.14 → 3624.52] you're too much of a Chad,
[3625.40 → 3626.22] just too much.
[3626.70 → 3628.94] You might as well just go commando full-time.
[3629.16 → 3632.44] It's that much of a concern that you just don't need your underwear all day.
[3632.44 → 3633.28] Then why even bother?
[3634.02 → 3635.04] But that's not all.
[3635.20 → 3638.42] We're also launching matching onesies.
[3638.62 → 3639.50] I'm going back to your laptop.
[3639.78 → 3639.92] Yep.
[3640.58 → 3641.78] How cute are those?
[3642.52 → 3645.86] They're made with a model cotton fabric that feels like having a fully
[3645.86 → 3649.50] legitimate reason to stay in your pajamas all day.
[3649.66 → 3655.44] You can shop the cats gamers collection at leg.GG slash cat gamer.
[3656.64 → 3657.12] Uh,
[3657.26 → 3657.50] Oh,
[3657.74 → 3658.30] Whoa,
[3658.44 → 3658.68] what?
[3660.14 → 3660.66] Oh,
[3660.66 → 3663.20] we've got another big LTT store announcement.
[3664.20 → 3666.62] While the site's been buzzing with Black Friday,
[3666.76 → 3669.02] Cyber Monday and holiday loot drop shoppers.
[3669.12 → 3671.82] Our mailbox has been buzzing too.
[3672.04 → 3672.56] Uh,
[3672.56 → 3676.88] we've been receiving your holiday loot drop mail-in entries and some of them are
[3676.88 → 3678.44] interesting.
[3678.44 → 3683.02] I've seen this.
[3683.06 → 3683.38] It says,
[3683.50 → 3684.80] do not show the address,
[3684.86 → 3686.34] which totally makes sense.
[3687.08 → 3687.50] Um,
[3688.30 → 3688.68] huh.
[3688.72 → 3690.66] I suggested we show this on the show.
[3691.66 → 3692.18] Hold on.
[3692.22 → 3692.72] I just got it.
[3693.10 → 3693.38] Okay.
[3693.44 → 3693.92] There we go.
[3694.86 → 3696.44] Are you able to bring that up,
[3696.50 → 3696.66] Dan?
[3696.74 → 3698.18] Do you have the picture?
[3700.48 → 3700.80] Oh,
[3700.80 → 3707.72] Oh yeah.
[3708.52 → 3709.20] Uh,
[3709.76 → 3710.76] wow.
[3711.54 → 3714.52] That is something.
[3715.86 → 3716.50] Um,
[3717.46 → 3721.10] so that was,
[3721.18 → 3723.20] that was one of the contest entries.
[3726.94 → 3728.10] Which you now own,
[3728.22 → 3728.56] I think.
[3729.34 → 3729.66] Oh,
[3730.80 → 3731.92] I think that's how that works.
[3732.28 → 3733.26] Oh joy.
[3739.48 → 3740.54] Oh my goodness.
[3741.28 → 3744.92] That's right up there with the weirdest things I've seen today.
[3745.54 → 3745.94] Today.
[3746.16 → 3746.42] Yeah.
[3746.52 → 3747.94] I was going to say all time.
[3748.04 → 3748.56] It's honestly.
[3751.00 → 3751.42] Yeah,
[3751.46 → 3751.64] no,
[3751.66 → 3752.94] it's not the way.
[3753.08 → 3753.20] I mean,
[3753.20 → 3754.48] it's not most of all time.
[3754.48 → 3756.54] I've sent you worse things in the last week.
[3758.16 → 3758.56] Yeah,
[3758.68 → 3759.06] actually.
[3759.28 → 3759.62] Yeah.
[3759.70 → 3759.96] Yeah.
[3759.96 → 3760.16] Yeah.
[3760.16 → 3760.40] Yeah.
[3760.40 → 3761.28] It took me a second,
[3761.38 → 3761.94] but definitely.
[3762.44 → 3762.84] Uh,
[3763.04 → 3763.30] yeah.
[3763.30 → 3763.70] Wow.
[3764.28 → 3764.72] Um,
[3765.44 → 3767.76] I'm almost afraid to open this other one.
[3768.68 → 3769.12] This,
[3769.32 → 3769.44] wait,
[3769.54 → 3769.90] this one,
[3769.96 → 3771.24] I don't think has been opened.
[3771.72 → 3771.88] Oh,
[3772.34 → 3772.58] Oh,
[3772.64 → 3773.06] hold on.
[3774.10 → 3774.52] Uh,
[3774.58 → 3775.14] Oh yeah.
[3775.14 → 3775.80] This is just,
[3775.88 → 3777.64] this is just the envelope for that.
[3777.70 → 3778.04] Okay.
[3779.64 → 3780.12] Um,
[3780.26 → 3781.26] anyway,
[3781.26 → 3782.50] so for context,
[3782.50 → 3782.80] so for context,
[3782.80 → 3786.46] there was a way to enter the holiday loot drop,
[3786.46 → 3786.92] uh,
[3786.92 → 3788.28] with no purchase necessary.
[3788.44 → 3790.36] That's a legal requirement in Canada.
[3790.36 → 3791.10] See you later.
[3791.66 → 3792.10] Um,
[3793.38 → 3794.08] uh,
[3794.28 → 3795.14] and so,
[3795.14 → 3795.78] uh,
[3795.78 → 3797.58] that was something that was sent to us.
[3797.58 → 3797.98] Okay.
[3799.08 → 3799.56] Wow.
[3800.26 → 3800.74] Um,
[3800.80 → 3801.50] anyway,
[3801.50 → 3802.22] uh,
[3802.22 → 3804.42] speaking of loot drops and deals,
[3804.42 → 3806.98] we're doing a few bonus deals before the year ends.
[3807.50 → 3807.74] Oh,
[3808.14 → 3808.40] cool.
[3808.66 → 3808.82] Uh,
[3808.82 → 3809.30] is this,
[3809.36 → 3810.02] is this like on,
[3810.10 → 3811.00] is there somewhere you can go?

[3927.98 → 3928.32] It's just,
[3928.44 → 3929.32] it's not a collection.
[3929.52 → 3929.86] Wow.
[3929.86 → 3932.44] We're really just selling a mouse for 20 bucks.
[3932.64 → 3932.78] Wow.

[3939.30 → 3939.56] Yep.
[3940.48 → 3940.80] Uh,
[3940.80 → 3940.92] well,
[3940.96 → 3942.78] we had them for a bundle at some point,
[3942.80 → 3943.12] I think.
[3943.30 → 3943.66] Okay.
[3943.84 → 3944.06] Uh,
[3944.06 → 3945.74] but right now we have mice,
[3945.94 → 3946.36] right?
[3946.58 → 3947.94] So neat.
[3947.94 → 3950.72] So kitties go get the mice.
[3951.62 → 3953.10] Because we're doing the cats and gamers.
[3953.28 → 3953.46] He's,
[3953.46 → 3954.74] he's calling you all cats.
[3954.90 → 3955.14] Well,
[3955.22 → 3955.52] I mean,
[3955.56 → 3956.20] they're cool cats.
[3956.44 → 3956.68] Oh,
[3956.72 → 3956.92] wow.
[3957.62 → 3958.02] They're,
[3958.30 → 3960.98] they're so cool.
[3961.04 → 3962.12] They're five times cool.
[3962.26 → 3962.94] They're cat five.
[3963.18 → 3963.22] I,
[3963.34 → 3963.66] you know what?
[3963.66 → 3964.16] It doesn't matter.
[3966.12 → 3967.58] We also hate Mondays.
[3968.08 → 3968.52] Yeah,
[3968.78 → 3970.14] it is Monday,
[3970.22 → 3970.42] right?
[3970.52 → 3971.76] I'm pretty sure it's Monday.
[3972.10 → 3973.66] It's been Monday for a decade.
[3974.76 → 3976.62] It's been Monday for a decade.
[3977.28 → 3979.02] You're just describing your thirties,
[3979.16 → 3979.28] Dan.
[3979.84 → 3980.60] Oh no.
[3982.42 → 3984.32] How did you know I was 64?
[3985.30 → 3986.14] Oh no.
[3986.48 → 3986.98] All right.
[3987.02 → 3988.38] Do you want a couple of merch messages?
[3989.06 → 3989.48] Uh,
[3989.56 → 3989.98] I do.
[3990.12 → 3990.40] I do.
[3990.46 → 3991.74] Hit me with a couple of merch messages.
[3991.90 → 3992.26] Okay.
[3992.64 → 3993.04] Linus,
[3993.10 → 3993.26] Luke,
[3993.72 → 3994.14] or Dan,
[3994.40 → 4001.28] what is the benefit of using the Corsair Thunderbolt 3 dock over a USB-C hub that has the same ports?
[4001.28 → 4003.48] Not much.
[4005.06 → 4005.58] Um,
[4005.66 → 4006.02] actually,
[4006.16 → 4006.48] hold on,
[4006.54 → 4006.80] hold on,
[4006.86 → 4007.18] hold on.
[4007.30 → 4007.60] Um,
[4007.70 → 4008.80] Thunderbolt can do some special stuff.
[4008.80 → 4009.62] It is a little different.
[4009.90 → 4009.98] Yeah.
[4010.02 → 4010.22] Yeah.
[4010.28 → 4012.00] So Thunderbolt can daisy-chain,
[4012.18 → 4013.24] which is pretty cool.
[4013.48 → 4013.84] Um,
[4013.94 → 4014.52] Thunderbolt,
[4015.04 → 4015.62] um,
[4015.82 → 4018.80] can have more bandwidth available to it.
[4019.08 → 4019.52] Um,
[4019.52 → 4021.24] which is also pretty cool.
[4021.80 → 4022.28] Um,
[4022.72 → 4025.60] I'm not a hundred percent sure which,
[4025.72 → 4025.88] uh,
[4025.92 → 4027.42] is that a Thunderbolt 3 dock?
[4027.42 → 4030.26] I think it's Thunderbolt 3,
[4030.40 → 4032.08] so I don't know if it supports the
[4032.22 → 4032.82] uh,
[4032.86 → 4032.98] the
[4033.12 → 4033.18] like,
[4033.28 → 4033.46] the
[4033.46 → 4034.48] the boosted,
[4034.48 → 4035.40] um,
[4036.96 → 4037.72] downstream,
[4038.14 → 4038.52] upstream,
[4039.04 → 4041.48] whichever stream is out of the computer,
[4041.48 → 4042.26] uh,
[4042.26 → 4043.88] to run more monitors,
[4043.88 → 4044.36] uh,
[4044.36 → 4046.20] but that is a benefit of Thunderbolt.
[4046.50 → 4046.78] Uh,
[4046.82 → 4049.26] Thunderbolt is also connected to PCI-E,
[4049.44 → 4056.08] so you can connect devices that require Thunderbolt rather than ones that run through just a USB controller,
[4056.08 → 4058.50] so running things like GPUs for instance.
[4058.66 → 4058.78] Now,
[4059.24 → 4068.16] it is worth noting that that's not super relevant for hub use because you wouldn't want to run an GPU at the end of a Thunderbolt daisy chain,
[4068.28 → 4068.90] uh,
[4068.90 → 4070.46] because it's not going to get the full bandwidth.
[4070.62 → 4071.82] You're not going to get the full benefit,
[4072.02 → 4081.88] but Thunderbolt and USB 4 are not quite the same thing as just a USB-C, USB 3 port.
[4082.06 → 4082.24] They,
[4082.28 → 4084.02] they do have some special functionality.
[4084.88 → 4085.32] Yeah,
[4085.38 → 4085.96] it is nicer.
[4086.08 → 4088.14] I don't know if you'll end up using the benefits,
[4088.14 → 4088.82] but I mean,
[4088.82 → 4089.36] if you're buying,
[4089.86 → 4090.64] holy,
[4091.02 → 4092.66] this dock is worth a lot of money.
[4093.78 → 4094.30] My goodness,
[4094.46 → 4094.96] what the heck?
[4096.68 → 4096.84] Oh,
[4097.00 → 4097.46] of course,
[4097.56 → 4098.04] there's a site.
[4098.34 → 4098.46] It's,
[4098.94 → 4099.20] yeah,
[4099.32 → 4099.84] but that's,
[4099.90 → 4100.60] let's be real.
[4100.62 → 4101.28] It's out of stock,
[4101.38 → 4102.14] so is that just like,
[4102.20 → 4105.96] that's pricing that was just never updated after this was EOL'd, probably.
[4106.06 → 4106.62] It was EOL'd,
[4106.62 → 4106.86] okay.
[4106.98 → 4107.14] Yeah.
[4107.26 → 4108.84] So they were trying to flip the rest of their stock.
[4108.92 → 4109.64] So to be clear,
[4109.74 → 4113.12] it's worth somewhere in between $0 and that much,
[4113.22 → 4114.38] but it's just a lot for a dock.
[4114.38 → 4115.26] But it's a nice Thunderbolt dock.
[4115.26 → 4115.82] I'm not saying like,
[4115.88 → 4116.36] oh my God,
[4116.40 → 4117.64] you're getting a crazy deal.
[4117.72 → 4119.46] I'm just saying it's a lot for a dock.
[4120.72 → 4121.44] Bad docks,
[4121.54 → 4123.64] I don't know if this dock is necessarily good or not,
[4123.74 → 4125.50] but bad docks can be really annoying.
[4125.66 → 4126.42] I'll say that much.
[4126.48 → 4126.60] Yep.
[4127.20 → 4127.56] Yeah,
[4127.56 → 4127.92] this one,
[4128.00 → 4128.88] this one seems fine.
[4128.88 → 4133.58] And we've actually bundled this dock before, and we've had perfectly good feedback on it.
[4133.66 → 4133.82] Cool.
[4134.06 → 4135.32] It's a corpulent Thunderbolt dock.
[4135.50 → 4135.80] Nice.
[4137.72 → 4138.16] Right.
[4138.30 → 4139.22] What else have you got?
[4139.44 → 4140.38] Utils says,
[4140.50 → 4142.48] is there no bundles for the global site?
[4142.78 → 4144.44] So this is the whole thing.
[4144.44 → 4145.80] You know how our,
[4145.80 → 4146.32] our,
[4146.50 → 4147.02] um,
[4147.32 → 4151.74] certain customers in certain regions have asked us many times,
[4151.74 → 4153.84] very calmly and quietly,
[4154.18 → 4154.92] um,
[4155.12 → 4159.74] why do you not have a distribution centre in our region to lower our shipping costs?
[4160.14 → 4168.44] It's because there is a lot of cost and a lot of overhead involved in having multiple distribution centres and a lot of just administrative burden.
[4168.44 → 4180.42] And this is one of the things that I'm talking about because absolutely nailing your stock distribution when you order in is practically impossible.
[4180.66 → 4182.38] That thing that he just said.
[4182.62 → 4194.26] And you guys had a better deal realistically during the Black Friday sales where it was a hundred dollar threshold, but it was a hundred dollar threshold for the Canadian site or the American site.
[4194.26 → 4199.54] Meaning the American site's threshold for three free shipping was effectively a hundred U S dollars.
[4199.84 → 4200.04] Yeah.
[4200.18 → 4201.72] This is a hundred Canadian dollars,
[4201.96 → 4203.36] which is very different.
[4203.60 → 4205.68] So what we discovered was that,
[4205.68 → 4206.54] um,
[4206.98 → 4210.28] global sales go burr when there's free shipping,
[4210.42 → 4212.40] when there's free shipping at such a low threshold.
[4212.40 → 4215.14] I don't know that we will do a low threshold like that again,
[4215.14 → 4215.88] uh,
[4215.88 → 4220.16] because the global site vastly outperformed our,
[4220.16 → 4221.10] um,
[4221.10 → 4222.34] our expectations,
[4222.34 → 4223.22] uh,
[4223.22 → 4225.74] for the mix compared to the U S site.
[4225.74 → 4228.20] I think it's also a factor that,
[4228.20 → 4228.56] uh,
[4228.56 → 4230.96] the U S market is a little bit,
[4230.96 → 4232.06] um,
[4232.18 → 4234.22] challenging right now.
[4234.32 → 4234.90] Uh,
[4234.90 → 4235.44] I've heard,
[4235.54 → 4241.76] I've heard scuttlebutt that it was a relatively slow Black Friday period in the U S this year,
[4241.76 → 4242.64] uh,
[4242.64 → 4245.02] which totally makes sense given that.
[4245.26 → 4248.74] I've heard that there was less sales volume,
[4248.74 → 4249.44] volume,
[4249.44 → 4252.84] but technically more sales dollars.
[4253.06 → 4253.80] Our margin was higher.
[4254.10 → 4254.44] Yes.
[4254.82 → 4255.20] Um,
[4255.20 → 4257.28] it sounds like margins are up.
[4257.86 → 4259.60] Overall sales volume is down.
[4259.74 → 4266.26] It's almost like all of these things that we've been talking about for the last little while are just kind of true.
[4266.26 → 4266.76] Yep.
[4266.82 → 4267.10] Uh,
[4267.10 → 4267.84] where it's a
[4267.90 → 4271.86] it's a small slice of the American consumer.
[4271.86 → 4275.92] And that small slice isn't going to care as much about the
[4276.02 → 4276.20] like,
[4276.28 → 4276.58] you know,
[4276.82 → 4281.48] stampede over each other and have deaths trying to get into Best Buy type of sales.
[4281.64 → 4284.38] They're just going to buy luxury stuff that they want.
[4284.46 → 4284.80] Yes.
[4284.98 → 4285.30] At,
[4285.42 → 4286.66] and they might've just been waiting.
[4286.84 → 4288.42] Because I don't know a good deal is cool,
[4288.42 → 4289.26] but like,
[4289.26 → 4289.52] yeah,
[4289.52 → 4290.44] it's not the same.
[4290.50 → 4293.06] We don't have the same level of black Fridays that we used to have.
[4293.08 → 4293.66] It's just,
[4293.78 → 4295.44] it's kind of a fact.
[4295.44 → 4295.92] Oh,
[4296.04 → 4297.16] speaking of,
[4297.26 → 4301.20] there was a cool little piece of news that I'm not sure if it,
[4301.20 → 4301.54] yeah.
[4301.96 → 4302.36] Oh,
[4302.70 → 4302.92] Oh,
[4302.94 → 4304.02] this is so sick.
[4304.60 → 4305.04] Um,
[4305.20 → 4309.50] New York introduces a new algorithmic pricing act.
[4309.58 → 4310.82] We never did any merge messages,
[4310.92 → 4311.10] Dan.
[4311.26 → 4311.62] What?
[4311.96 → 4312.44] You did one.
[4312.66 → 4313.20] We did one.
[4313.28 → 4313.56] Did we?
[4313.64 → 4313.84] Oh,
[4314.02 → 4314.26] okay,
[4314.26 → 4314.46] cool.
[4315.28 → 4315.64] Uh,
[4315.68 → 4315.94] all right,
[4315.94 → 4316.12] sure.
[4316.12 → 4316.36] Let's,
[4316.48 → 4316.86] let's move on.
[4316.90 → 4317.26] We'll do more.
[4318.18 → 4319.08] We'll do more later.
[4319.58 → 4320.86] New York attorney general,
[4320.94 → 4327.52] Letitia James has issued a statewide consumer alert following the rollout of the algorithmic pricing
[4327.52 → 4328.54] disclosure act,
[4328.62 → 4329.76] which is now in effect.
[4329.76 → 4340.28] The law requires most businesses using algorithmic or surveillance pricing to clearly disclose when a price is being set using a customer's personal data.
[4340.78 → 4347.26] Companies that fail to do so can face penalties of $1,000 per violation.
[4347.84 → 4348.00] Awesome.
[4348.00 → 4352.00] This is awesome.
[4352.44 → 4353.00] Very cool.
[4353.92 → 4354.70] Based even.
[4354.94 → 4355.22] Yes.
[4355.62 → 4356.92] Algorithmic pricing systems,
[4357.00 → 4357.98] if you're not familiar with them,
[4358.38 → 4361.06] adjust prices based on factors like location,
[4361.56 → 4362.00] income,
[4362.42 → 4363.18] browsing behaviour,
[4363.42 → 4364.56] and past purchases,
[4364.70 → 4370.20] meaning that two customers may be charged different amounts for exactly the same product.
[4370.20 → 4375.00] The attorney general is urging New Yorkers to compare prices across devices,
[4375.38 → 4375.80] accounts,
[4376.16 → 4376.98] and locations.
[4377.34 → 4377.48] Hey,
[4377.56 → 4380.40] now's a perfect time to shout out our VPN partner,
[4380.60 → 4381.04] PIA.
[4381.38 → 4382.72] You'll find a link to them down below.
[4383.24 → 4383.46] Um,
[4383.50 → 4385.16] and file complaints.
[4385.40 → 4386.74] If disclosures are missing,
[4387.50 → 4390.82] affected businesses are now required to display the statement.
[4390.82 → 4395.10] This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.
[4396.10 → 4398.90] This is a step in the right direction.
[4400.42 → 4402.18] Or hear me out.
[4402.80 → 4406.20] What if we just don't have algorithmic pricing?
[4407.28 → 4407.56] Okay.
[4407.58 → 4408.46] Could we make our way?
[4408.54 → 4409.62] Could we make our way there?
[4410.30 → 4414.72] Would geographically set pricing count as that?
[4414.84 → 4417.60] Because are they pulling in your location?
[4417.92 → 4419.34] Does that count as that?
[4419.34 → 4422.74] Because that has often been praised.
[4423.46 → 4423.86] Yeah.
[4424.08 → 4424.22] No,
[4424.28 → 4424.42] well,
[4424.44 → 4424.78] hold on.
[4424.86 → 4425.02] Yeah.
[4425.10 → 4425.26] Yeah.
[4425.26 → 4425.54] Hold on.
[4425.58 → 4426.08] Let's back up.
[4426.14 → 4427.18] Let's back up a second here.
[4427.30 → 4428.04] There's always,
[4428.18 → 4431.40] there's always unintended consequences.
[4431.40 → 4441.74] And the last thing that I want is for someone from Turkmenistan to all of a sudden not be able to afford any of the services they use because they have to like pay in U.S. dollars or whatever.
[4441.74 → 4442.36] That's not,
[4442.46 → 4443.86] that is not what I want.
[4444.92 → 4445.36] Um,
[4445.44 → 4445.96] okay.
[4446.22 → 4449.14] And I don't think it's quite as simple as just setting,
[4449.34 → 4450.10] uh,
[4450.12 → 4450.36] you know,
[4450.38 → 4454.58] having a different domain that is just like cheaper because then everyone will buy it.
[4454.76 → 4455.14] Just use it.
[4455.14 → 4458.08] So you need to grab some amount of that.
[4458.32 → 4458.44] Okay.
[4458.68 → 4459.12] Okay.
[4459.26 → 4459.62] Okay.
[4459.92 → 4460.32] But,
[4460.40 → 4460.72] but,
[4460.82 → 4461.04] okay,
[4461.08 → 4465.18] but it's clear that there are elements of algorithmic pricing that they just shouldn't be using.
[4465.28 → 4466.36] Why do you need my income?
[4467.16 → 4467.40] Yeah.
[4467.50 → 4468.26] And they do that.
[4468.50 → 4468.70] Yeah.
[4468.70 → 4469.68] You don't need that.
[4469.74 → 4469.94] Yeah.
[4469.94 → 4470.94] To set a price.
[4471.04 → 4472.32] The price should be the price.
[4474.76 → 4475.24] Hmm.
[4475.24 → 4476.90] Oh,
[4476.90 → 4477.40] man.
[4480.76 → 4481.42] We'll see.
[4481.62 → 4482.18] We'll see how it goes.
[4482.58 → 4482.70] Uh,
[4482.76 → 4483.22] in general,
[4483.34 → 4484.64] seems like a cool idea.
[4484.76 → 4485.02] Yeah.
[4485.10 → 4485.52] I mean,
[4485.54 → 4487.98] at least if nothing else,
[4487.98 → 4489.12] this is,
[4489.20 → 4490.06] this is a start.
[4490.50 → 4491.90] This is awareness.
[4492.26 → 4492.48] Yeah.
[4492.98 → 4496.16] Raising awareness for how your data is being used.
[4496.36 → 4496.96] I'm just,
[4496.96 → 4501.24] I'm just worried that if it ends up on literally everything or not quite,
[4501.24 → 4503.64] not quite literally everything,
[4503.74 → 4504.72] but close to everything.
[4505.22 → 4505.66] Um,
[4505.88 → 4512.16] I'm a little bit worried that people will just become numb to it because it's on everything
[4512.16 → 4514.78] because it also includes geos.
[4514.94 → 4515.24] Yes.
[4516.18 → 4516.44] I'm,
[4516.48 → 4516.94] I'm worried.
[4517.10 → 4517.62] It's,
[4517.70 → 4521.76] I would like this to really go after things like where it's taking in your,
[4521.76 → 4523.26] your income or,
[4523.26 → 4523.54] or,
[4523.54 → 4529.98] or how frantic you might be for trying to book a flight or knowing because of email scraping
[4529.98 → 4531.20] or some junk like that,
[4531.26 → 4531.78] that there's a
[4531.90 → 4532.06] or,
[4532.16 → 4532.30] or,
[4532.40 → 4532.54] you know,
[4532.54 → 4535.40] data sharing that there's a funeral that you have to go to.
[4535.48 → 4537.96] So you're probably not going to miss that flight so they can up charge you,
[4538.02 → 4538.24] whatever.
[4538.38 → 4539.46] This is a thing that they do.
[4540.00 → 4540.40] Um,
[4540.76 → 4544.84] I would like it to be able to focus on stuff like that.
[4544.88 → 4551.64] I would like the threshold to be a little bit up just so that we don't become desensitized.
[4551.64 → 4551.96] Like,
[4551.96 → 4552.78] as you said,
[4552.96 → 4553.04] we,
[4553.26 → 4554.40] a lot of people have with cookies.
[4554.62 → 4557.00] The Judo of what in float plane chat says,
[4557.10 → 4559.30] how the fuck can they even know about my income?
[4559.98 → 4560.12] Well,
[4560.18 → 4566.88] that's why I think this is so based because all of a sudden it's going to make you ask that.
[4566.96 → 4569.68] And there are so many ways.
[4569.68 → 4570.04] Like,
[4570.52 → 4574.94] I don't know how careful you are about the way that you post online.
[4575.12 → 4575.38] Maybe,
[4575.50 → 4576.52] maybe you're super careful,
[4576.76 → 4579.82] but something as simple as like,
[4579.82 → 4581.30] you might sell your data uploading.
[4581.30 → 4581.82] Well,
[4581.96 → 4582.20] okay.
[4582.30 → 4582.80] That too,
[4582.90 → 4583.28] but okay.
[4583.36 → 4583.62] Let's,
[4584.86 → 4585.26] Oh,
[4585.92 → 4589.58] and your bank and your insurance company and everything else.
[4589.58 → 4591.68] I mean,
[4591.96 → 4592.42] yeah.
[4592.46 → 4593.84] Credit score would be one.
[4593.98 → 4600.56] That company that you used to send out RSVPs for your wedding might sell that data.
[4601.00 → 4601.96] Some people can tell,
[4602.20 → 4604.42] these sites can tell if you're going to a wedding or not.
[4604.70 → 4604.90] Yeah.
[4605.00 → 4605.52] Um,
[4605.52 → 4608.52] there's like that type of stuff all over the place.
[4611.22 → 4611.66] Yeah.
[4611.78 → 4612.82] Your data has value.
[4612.98 → 4613.18] You,
[4613.28 → 4614.90] you all know that your data has value,
[4614.90 → 4617.00] but this is one of the ways that your data has.
[4617.08 → 4618.52] And we can even quantify it.
[4618.52 → 4619.00] We,
[4619.04 → 4628.12] we can actually quantify how much value your data has by just looking at products that have an ad supported version and then have a
[4628.28 → 4628.36] no,
[4628.44 → 4631.74] you just pay for this version or like a data supported version rather.
[4631.74 → 4632.42] Um,
[4632.42 → 4635.24] so like Facebook for instance has in the
[4635.34 → 4636.08] in the EU,
[4636.24 → 4638.62] they have paid versions of their accounts.
[4638.62 → 4639.14] So you,
[4639.16 → 4639.46] you can,
[4639.54 → 4644.08] you can quantify like exactly how much the average person's data is worth.
[4644.14 → 4644.40] I mean,
[4644.40 → 4645.28] we saw with the
[4645.32 → 4645.60] uh,
[4645.60 → 4645.90] with the
[4646.00 → 4650.14] was it the meta quest two or the one was the first one that had an
[4650.14 → 4655.70] a non Facebook account version that was like double the price or whatever it worked out to.
[4655.98 → 4656.80] Like the
[4656.80 → 4661.58] the ad subsidy that goes into products is more than you would,
[4662.00 → 4663.62] more than most people would think.
[4663.70 → 4663.92] Yeah.
[4664.00 → 4664.30] I think,
[4664.40 → 4664.66] I mean,
[4664.66 → 4664.94] there's,
[4665.02 → 4666.28] there's that classic story.
[4666.36 → 4667.46] People in full plan should have pointed out,
[4667.48 → 4674.78] but we've talked about this on WAN show before target figured out that a girl was pregnant before like a high school age girl was pregnant before her dad did.
[4676.46 → 4676.86] Really?
[4677.06 → 4677.24] Yeah.
[4677.24 → 4679.80] Cause of like shopping habits and credit card spending and stuff.
[4680.48 → 4681.02] I mean,
[4681.02 → 4684.56] was it as simple as like buying pregnancy tests or like to don't,
[4684.56 → 4684.98] well,
[4685.02 → 4686.56] that doesn't say that you're pregnant.
[4687.50 → 4687.94] Right.
[4688.40 → 4688.70] I mean,
[4688.70 → 4689.92] if you bought like five,
[4690.04 → 4690.50] it might,
[4690.82 → 4694.96] but I'm not sure exactly what it was,
[4694.98 → 4696.56] but something along those lines.
[4698.20 → 4699.58] Funky shark 88 says,
[4699.68 → 4705.26] and yet companies floated by just fine without the need to sell these vitamins apparently in decades gone by.
[4705.94 → 4706.42] Um,
[4706.84 → 4707.44] yeah.
[4709.42 → 4709.86] Yeah.
[4709.86 → 4709.92] Yeah.
[4710.04 → 4710.22] Yeah.
[4710.22 → 4710.66] They did.
[4710.76 → 4711.14] I mean,
[4711.20 → 4711.54] I,
[4711.66 → 4712.04] um,
[4712.66 → 4712.94] makes,
[4712.94 → 4715.56] I remembered it being before she knew herself as well,
[4715.64 → 4717.88] but I just looked it up and everything says it was her dad.
[4717.96 → 4718.62] So I think we're,
[4718.74 → 4719.44] I think we're just,
[4719.50 → 4719.80] uh,
[4719.80 → 4720.80] remembering correctly.
[4721.00 → 4722.30] Mandela affecting ourselves here.
[4722.32 → 4722.74] I think so.
[4723.08 → 4723.22] Yeah.
[4723.22 → 4723.60] Um,
[4723.70 → 4723.94] yeah,
[4723.96 → 4724.36] I don't know.
[4724.46 → 4729.44] LTT store manages to exist just fine without selling company or company,
[4729.52 → 4729.66] uh,
[4729.66 → 4730.90] without selling customer data.
[4731.72 → 4732.20] Um,
[4732.32 → 4732.58] I,
[4732.62 → 4732.90] I,
[4732.96 → 4733.84] I don't really,
[4734.66 → 4737.98] I don't really see why this has to be done either.
[4737.98 → 4744.80] There are industries that I do understand why they've moved to that way.
[4745.28 → 4745.66] Um,
[4745.66 → 4746.72] I don't like it.
[4746.84 → 4748.20] I hate it.
[4748.20 → 4748.80] In fact,
[4749.22 → 4749.62] um,
[4749.68 → 4751.78] the airline industry is one for instance,
[4751.90 → 4761.48] that has been under a lot of self-imposed pressure to,
[4761.48 → 4769.42] to grow in volume and therefore has made a lot of questionable decisions to,
[4769.56 → 4770.84] to maintain profits.
[4771.54 → 4772.10] Um,
[4773.18 → 4773.74] like,
[4773.94 → 4774.52] I don't know.
[4774.56 → 4774.72] It's,
[4774.82 → 4776.60] I was talking to Yvonne about this the other day.
[4776.86 → 4778.42] Like when we were kids,
[4778.86 → 4779.76] both of us,
[4779.76 → 4781.36] like our families growing up,
[4781.36 → 4784.06] we had like two vacations,
[4784.30 → 4785.46] our entire childhood step.
[4785.56 → 4785.84] We're like,
[4785.88 → 4785.98] Oh,
[4786.04 → 4787.04] fly somewhere at three.
[4787.04 → 4787.50] I think,
[4787.58 → 4788.12] I think I was,
[4788.18 → 4790.40] I was at three and like,
[4791.44 → 4791.86] I don't know,
[4791.92 → 4793.50] talking to other parents at the school,
[4793.64 → 4793.86] man,
[4793.96 → 4797.08] there are families that like go somewhere every year.
[4797.34 → 4797.68] Yeah.
[4797.78 → 4799.38] Like they fly somewhere every year.
[4799.52 → 4799.80] Yeah.
[4800.28 → 4801.88] And that wasn't use either.
[4802.06 → 4802.36] Yeah.
[4802.62 → 4802.88] I,
[4802.96 → 4803.48] that like,
[4803.54 → 4804.22] wasn't that.
[4804.48 → 4807.22] I don't think that was a thing when we were kids.
[4807.78 → 4808.20] Yeah.
[4808.20 → 4808.80] I don't think so.
[4808.96 → 4810.36] And so in order to,
[4810.44 → 4812.54] and so coming back to what I was saying about how,
[4812.54 → 4813.76] when you build the capacity,
[4813.96 → 4815.80] you like kind of have to use it.
[4816.34 → 4816.74] Um,
[4816.74 → 4817.68] so if the
[4817.78 → 4819.96] if the value of the seat goes down,
[4819.96 → 4824.00] then you have to squeeze other places in order to maintain your profit.
[4824.00 → 4827.68] I think they've done to themselves this race to zero.
[4827.86 → 4828.00] Dude,
[4828.14 → 4828.92] I was at the
[4829.06 → 4830.70] this is only tangentially related,
[4830.70 → 4832.12] but I was at the airport,
[4832.24 → 4832.78] uh,
[4832.78 → 4833.36] LAX.
[4833.52 → 4834.02] Yeah.
[4834.14 → 4835.46] And my gate.
[4835.46 → 4836.32] So from,
[4836.42 → 4841.58] from security all the way through to the end of the walkable area,
[4841.58 → 4846.72] I checked every single store that sold bottles of water.
[4846.74 → 4847.46] Oh,
[4847.68 → 4850.84] every single one of them only had the really expensive,
[4850.84 → 4852.34] like fancy,
[4852.40 → 4853.60] like path or whatever,
[4853.60 → 4854.04] like the
[4854.04 → 4855.58] the metal bottles or Fiji.
[4855.90 → 4856.14] No,
[4856.26 → 4856.70] not even.
[4856.80 → 4857.12] What?
[4857.22 → 4857.52] Really?
[4857.68 → 4859.60] They only had metal bottles.
[4860.04 → 4861.92] There literally wasn't a single,
[4861.92 → 4864.22] like cheaper plastic bottle thing.
[4864.22 → 4866.98] And these are like really expensive,
[4866.98 → 4869.58] like more expensive than all the other drinks,
[4869.70 → 4870.94] their bottles of water.
[4870.94 → 4874.94] And it was every single store in the entire,
[4874.94 → 4875.66] uh,
[4875.66 → 4877.20] whatever you want to wing or whatever it's called.
[4877.74 → 4878.14] Um,
[4879.14 → 4879.76] it was brutal.
[4880.42 → 4881.42] It was really brutal.
[4881.56 → 4883.10] I'm trying to find a picture right now.
[4883.10 → 4883.34] Water.
[4883.46 → 4884.10] You were just screwed.
[4884.10 → 4891.14] I took a picture of a sandwich that I refused to buy on a recent trip because I was just so,
[4891.30 → 4891.90] I was like,
[4892.66 → 4893.80] like offended by the price.
[4894.22 → 4898.56] Legitimately so upset by the price of it that on my way out of the store,
[4898.56 → 4901.02] I like made a comment to another customer just,
[4901.12 → 4908.14] just because I needed someone to talk to about how ludicrous this price was.
[4908.14 → 4910.18] I don't know if I'm going to be able to find it,
[4910.18 → 4911.16] but,
[4911.30 → 4911.60] uh,
[4912.22 → 4913.50] I was just like,
[4913.56 → 4919.26] I would rather look, and I'm not going to pretend let's make this abundantly clear.
[4919.52 → 4922.70] I'm not going to pretend that I couldn't afford to buy it.
[4922.72 → 4923.34] I could,
[4924.14 → 4925.78] but I wouldn't.
[4926.12 → 4926.44] Uh,
[4926.44 → 4928.54] people in full plane chat are talking about how there was,
[4928.56 → 4929.46] there was a
[4929.60 → 4930.48] uh,
[4930.58 → 4930.98] here it is.
[4931.20 → 4937.00] There was a dude who bought something in cash at Walmart, and he got an email later on asking to review it.
[4938.92 → 4941.38] Because he used like biometric camera data stuff.
[4941.60 → 4941.90] Oh my God.
[4942.06 → 4942.32] Yeah.
[4943.40 → 4943.84] Shoot.
[4943.92 → 4944.62] Did I not?
[4946.66 → 4947.44] I didn't.
[4947.62 → 4950.92] There's a class action lawsuit from 2022 of Walmart,
[4951.12 → 4951.80] uh,
[4952.46 → 4952.86] collecting,
[4953.04 → 4954.84] storing and using customer biometric data.
[4957.00 → 4957.44] Uh,
[4957.50 → 4957.76] dang.
[4958.56 → 4958.92] Dan,
[4958.98 → 4959.88] I'm going to send this to you.
[4959.94 → 4960.84] It wasn't a sandwich.
[4961.08 → 4961.42] I,
[4961.48 → 4961.66] uh,
[4961.66 → 4962.64] I misremembered it.
[4962.82 → 4965.44] And unfortunately I didn't write down the price.
[4965.52 → 4969.88] What I do know was that it was over 10 us dollars.
[4970.60 → 4971.04] Um,
[4971.70 → 4972.06] yeah.
[4972.12 → 4973.22] So someone in full plane chat said,
[4973.32 → 4975.50] now that Walmart cash transaction is BS.
[4975.66 → 4975.84] Yeah.
[4975.84 → 4977.82] I can't find like real facts on it.
[4977.88 → 4980.18] I just found like someone's like selfie video.
[4980.24 → 4980.60] I don't know.
[4980.60 → 4980.74] Okay.
[4980.74 → 4980.98] Dan,
[4981.08 → 4981.64] throw this up.
[4981.64 → 4982.64] Doesn't necessarily mean much.
[4982.64 → 4984.62] So by the time I converted to Canadian,
[4984.82 → 4988.42] I was basically going to be like eating quarters essentially.
[4988.58 → 4989.14] So what do you guys,
[4989.36 → 4990.82] what it came out to a carrot.
[4991.34 → 4991.74] Yeah.
[4991.74 → 4993.14] You've got some carrot slices.
[4993.36 → 4993.56] Yeah.
[4993.56 → 4993.64] Uh,
[4993.92 → 4994.56] some cucumber,
[4994.84 → 4996.02] a little bit of ranch dressing.
[4996.02 → 4997.84] So this was at sea tech,
[4998.04 → 4998.38] uh,
[4998.38 → 4999.06] Seattle airport.
[4999.64 → 5000.36] And I just,
[5000.46 → 5000.76] I just,
[5000.82 → 5001.72] I wanted some,
[5001.84 → 5005.40] I wanted like some vegetables because when you travel,
[5005.40 → 5006.24] I don't know what it is,
[5006.24 → 5006.58] but I just,
[5006.66 → 5008.26] I have a hard time finding like,
[5008.44 → 5008.56] no,
[5008.62 → 5009.62] I absolutely agree.
[5009.74 → 5010.86] Because you're always eating out.
[5011.12 → 5011.96] And like,
[5012.26 → 5013.26] when I was at DEFCON,
[5013.40 → 5015.74] I tried to stop at a little corner store to get some,
[5015.74 → 5017.24] a little like fruit and vegetables,
[5017.34 → 5018.00] little thing.
[5018.06 → 5018.80] Because I was like,
[5018.84 → 5019.56] Oh my God,
[5019.64 → 5021.58] it's just garbage everywhere.
[5021.58 → 5022.08] Basically.
[5022.08 → 5022.36] Yeah.
[5022.36 → 5024.02] And the cashier warned me.
[5024.08 → 5024.40] He was like,
[5024.42 → 5025.58] you probably don't want to buy that.
[5026.02 → 5026.84] I was like,
[5026.92 → 5027.16] why?
[5027.24 → 5027.78] And he's like,
[5028.28 → 5028.64] uh,
[5028.66 → 5028.88] like,
[5028.92 → 5030.38] cause there's no pricing on really anything.
[5030.58 → 5030.92] He's like,
[5030.96 → 5031.78] I don't remember what it was,
[5031.82 → 5032.66] but it was something like,
[5032.76 → 5036.90] I was actually somewhat stunned at how I don't remember how much it was.
[5036.92 → 5037.38] I wish it did.
[5037.74 → 5038.06] Uh,
[5038.06 → 5038.38] but he,
[5038.46 → 5039.18] I was,
[5039.26 → 5041.38] I like thanked him and put it back and was like,
[5041.42 → 5041.60] yeah,
[5041.60 → 5042.00] I mean,
[5042.34 → 5042.56] yeah,
[5042.56 → 5043.44] that is too much.
[5043.58 → 5044.84] I refused to buy it.
[5044.88 → 5045.50] It's just like,
[5045.50 → 5046.02] I,
[5046.06 → 5047.50] I'm not going to like,
[5047.50 → 5047.72] I,
[5047.72 → 5048.06] I've,
[5048.06 → 5050.54] I've never really been able to get,
[5050.80 → 5051.92] get over the
[5052.00 → 5053.44] like how much,
[5053.56 → 5054.00] because I,
[5054.04 → 5054.46] I don't know.
[5054.52 → 5054.84] I don't know.
[5054.86 → 5056.00] I just have a busy brain.
[5056.02 → 5061.36] And so I'm always doing the math of like how much per when I'm,
[5061.50 → 5062.36] when I'm doing something.
[5062.54 → 5062.64] Sure.
[5062.80 → 5063.84] So like paintball,
[5063.96 → 5064.56] I,
[5064.68 → 5065.36] I really,
[5065.48 → 5071.36] I really struggled when I played at like the commercial fields because I'd be like,
[5071.36 → 5072.98] nickel,
[5073.74 → 5074.14] nickel,
[5074.80 → 5075.12] nickel,
[5076.34 → 5077.36] quarter,
[5077.72 → 5080.28] dollar,
[5080.38 → 5080.64] dollar.
[5080.86 → 5080.96] Yeah.
[5081.10 → 5081.38] Fuck.
[5081.88 → 5082.10] You know,
[5082.22 → 5083.16] I missed all of those.
[5083.26 → 5084.72] It cost me a dollar to do nothing.
[5084.92 → 5085.32] Yeah.
[5085.32 → 5086.18] Like I just,
[5086.28 → 5087.82] cost me a dollar to give my position away.
[5088.12 → 5088.32] Yeah.
[5088.38 → 5088.66] Right.
[5088.72 → 5089.18] Exactly.
[5089.60 → 5091.14] What a terrible value.
[5094.14 → 5095.06] And so I,
[5095.06 → 5095.70] I don't,
[5095.80 → 5096.16] I have,
[5096.24 → 5097.74] then you get mad at the other people because it is like,
[5097.78 → 5101.54] it cost me $3 to cover you, and you just ran out and open and got shot.
[5101.66 → 5101.92] Yeah.
[5102.12 → 5102.88] Way to go.
[5102.88 → 5103.28] Yeah.
[5103.48 → 5104.00] I mean,
[5104.06 → 5105.74] I wasn't that toxic about it,
[5105.80 → 5106.20] but it's just,
[5106.28 → 5107.54] it's something that's in the back of my mind.
[5107.58 → 5108.26] It's distracting.
[5108.34 → 5109.06] Whereas when I,
[5109.14 → 5110.60] when I just play like woods ball,
[5110.70 → 5111.48] like outlaw ball,
[5111.56 → 5113.16] then it's like whatever.
[5113.16 → 5113.46] Right.
[5113.46 → 5113.76] You just,
[5113.82 → 5117.42] you bring it an entire case of paint, and you're down to like,
[5117.50 → 5117.74] you know,
[5117.80 → 5119.32] a penny or two for,
[5119.44 → 5120.06] for each round.
[5120.26 → 5120.84] Easier to ignore.
[5121.06 → 5121.42] Yeah.
[5121.42 → 5123.28] It's easier to not have to think about.
[5123.38 → 5124.98] I just don't want to have to think about it.
[5125.02 → 5125.20] You know,
[5125.20 → 5130.60] I want to enjoy the game and I can't enjoy that veggie platter when I'm going,
[5130.84 → 5131.62] how much was it?
[5131.70 → 5131.86] Sorry.
[5132.42 → 5132.82] Quarter.
[5133.00 → 5133.26] You know,
[5133.26 → 5133.38] I,
[5133.54 → 5133.74] it was,
[5133.92 → 5137.26] it was like nine or 10 us dollars or something like that.
[5137.26 → 5141.28] So it's like 15 bucks Canadian by the time I converted it.
[5141.42 → 5142.06] I just,
[5142.34 → 5143.38] it's just offensive.
[5143.98 → 5144.24] Yeah.
[5144.42 → 5144.68] Just,
[5144.82 → 5146.92] or 14 or 13 or something like that.
[5146.98 → 5147.16] Just,
[5147.32 → 5148.04] just offensive.
[5148.56 → 5148.84] Um,
[5148.98 → 5149.90] JR comm asks,
[5149.98 → 5150.72] how about fireworks?
[5151.24 → 5151.80] Honestly,
[5152.48 → 5154.14] exactly the same thing.
[5154.22 → 5157.42] I love fireworks.
[5158.00 → 5158.98] They're so cool.
[5159.80 → 5161.12] And we,
[5162.02 → 5163.86] in my children's lifetime,
[5164.22 → 5166.98] they have had a home fireworks display.
[5168.12 → 5169.28] A modest one,
[5169.42 → 5176.70] very small one time so that they can remember that we did fireworks one time.
[5177.60 → 5180.84] It's also like a major pain in the butt because of all the regulations around
[5180.84 → 5181.66] fireworks here now.
[5181.88 → 5182.02] Yeah.
[5182.26 → 5183.34] And also the cost.
[5183.46 → 5185.12] So it's a pain in the butt, and it's expensive.
[5185.46 → 5190.44] We did it one time, and hopefully they remember it because I don't think we're
[5190.44 → 5191.18] going to do it again.
[5191.28 → 5195.12] Because it was like $200, and we burned through all of it.
[5195.12 → 5195.48] And like,
[5195.92 → 5196.38] I don't know,
[5196.46 → 5198.30] 15 minutes or something like that.
[5198.32 → 5199.00] It was like the
[5199.06 → 5199.78] the lowest,
[5199.90 → 5206.56] the lowest value per hour thing that we probably did that year or the highest value
[5206.56 → 5207.98] per hour thing we did that year.
[5208.36 → 5209.02] And there's,
[5209.22 → 5213.44] there's a like kind of block party thing that happens for Halloween somewhere that I
[5213.44 → 5213.72] know.
[5213.72 → 5215.46] And they're in like a bed.
[5215.46 → 5216.82] It's not actually a cul-de-sac,
[5217.06 → 5218.62] but it's a little like kind of loop thing.
[5219.16 → 5219.60] Um,
[5220.08 → 5224.14] and they fire off fireworks like basically all night.
[5224.14 → 5225.42] Like they start at like,
[5225.82 → 5226.38] I don't know,
[5226.74 → 5229.28] probably six or seven.
[5229.28 → 5232.08] And they go until probably at least 11.
[5232.24 → 5233.06] And it's not,
[5233.38 → 5237.00] it's not extremely high rate,
[5237.26 → 5238.38] but it is constant.
[5238.64 → 5240.54] And I have thought before of like,
[5241.00 → 5241.30] dang,
[5241.40 → 5243.46] I think there are probably a few people contributing to this,
[5243.56 → 5244.62] but dang,
[5244.92 → 5246.52] like you said,
[5246.62 → 5247.92] 15 minutes is not.
[5248.12 → 5249.90] And you're literally burning money.
[5250.10 → 5251.20] And exploding it.
[5251.32 → 5251.54] Yeah.
[5251.92 → 5252.28] Exploding.
[5252.80 → 5253.72] Thank you for that.
[5253.72 → 5256.90] Did we,
[5257.00 → 5258.14] did we start a topic?
[5258.66 → 5259.78] What are we talking about?
[5259.82 → 5260.90] I was going to ask.
[5261.18 → 5261.32] Well,
[5261.34 → 5261.66] I think,
[5261.80 → 5262.32] uh,
[5262.62 → 5264.44] I think that was algorithmic price.
[5264.68 → 5265.08] You know,
[5265.14 → 5270.28] what else has exploded is Intel's GPU market share.
[5270.40 → 5270.54] Oh,
[5270.64 → 5271.14] let's go.
[5271.14 → 5274.14] According to Tech spot and John Petty research,
[5274.66 → 5283.30] Q3 saw both AMD and Intel expand their shares of the discrete GPU market with AMD increasing to
[5283.30 → 5284.30] 7%.
[5285.12 → 5290.68] And Intel reaching a milestone.
[5291.32 → 5292.48] One person.
[5293.06 → 5293.58] Yeah.
[5295.58 → 5297.08] Dan's getting it on the action.
[5297.62 → 5299.04] It might be rounded up.
[5299.10 → 5300.14] It might be like 0.6.
[5300.42 → 5300.66] Listen,
[5300.84 → 5302.40] I don't know,
[5302.52 → 5302.72] but,
[5302.72 → 5306.04] but not being zero is cool.
[5306.04 → 5308.10] Because we need competition.
[5308.10 → 5308.72] And you know,
[5308.84 → 5310.30] it might not be a card for you now,
[5310.38 → 5311.68] but it might be in the future.
[5311.78 → 5312.58] And that's the cool part.
[5312.58 → 5312.94] Nvidia.
[5312.94 → 5312.98] Nvidia.
[5313.10 → 5313.50] Meanwhile,
[5313.50 → 5319.22] has suffered a drop in their market share to 92%.
[5319.22 → 5320.46] Oh no.
[5320.84 → 5321.46] Oh no.
[5321.62 → 5322.24] Poor Nvidia.
[5322.42 → 5322.74] Whatever.
[5322.88 → 5323.26] However,
[5323.40 → 5325.44] will Jensen afford his leather jackets?
[5325.58 → 5327.88] Now he probably doesn't even want that 92%.
[5327.88 → 5330.08] He probably just feels obligated at this point.
[5330.90 → 5331.42] Well,
[5331.46 → 5332.72] everyone expects this of me.
[5332.80 → 5333.06] Yeah.
[5333.14 → 5333.34] I saw,
[5333.40 → 5335.80] I saw an interview of him recently that he's like,
[5335.84 → 5335.94] yeah,
[5335.94 → 5338.28] I work seven days a week because I fear bankruptcy.
[5338.28 → 5338.76] I mean,
[5338.76 → 5339.28] if I was,
[5339.38 → 5341.10] if I was at the
[5341.10 → 5348.14] the sort of arrow tip of a bubble headed towards the popping of a bubble,
[5348.14 → 5349.58] I'd probably be worried about that too.
[5349.64 → 5352.24] But I don't think bankruptcy is ever going to be a concern.
[5352.24 → 5352.52] Mr.
[5352.56 → 5352.82] Wong.
[5352.82 → 5353.46] Um,
[5354.06 → 5357.44] I think that it's more just like not being,
[5357.68 → 5357.82] you know,
[5357.88 → 5360.94] one of the like handful of richest people in the world is,
[5360.94 → 5361.34] is,
[5361.34 → 5361.62] uh,
[5361.62 → 5362.30] at stake here.
[5362.80 → 5362.92] Yeah.
[5362.92 → 5364.20] Anywho data centre,
[5364.28 → 5368.80] GPU board sales are up an average of 145.5% compared to Q2.
[5369.04 → 5369.22] So,
[5369.22 → 5371.30] so those are doing fine,
[5371.30 → 5372.52] just fine.
[5372.66 → 5376.10] And NVIDIA's market share in that space might be even higher.
[5376.26 → 5376.74] Uh,
[5376.74 → 5382.16] I remember chatting with the guys at SFU, and they wouldn't confirm this.
[5382.30 → 5384.78] I'm not going to put any words in their mouths.
[5385.12 → 5385.52] Okay.
[5385.88 → 5387.40] But my speculation,
[5387.40 → 5394.54] they had one machine with AMD instinct in it.
[5394.82 → 5395.18] One.
[5396.10 → 5399.98] And my speculation as to why they had that one machine,
[5400.08 → 5401.40] because at that point you might think,
[5401.58 → 5403.12] why bother?
[5403.58 → 5403.76] Right?
[5404.46 → 5404.68] Yeah.
[5404.84 → 5409.02] My speculation was so that you can point at that one,
[5409.34 → 5410.32] that in the background,
[5410.52 → 5411.66] you're kind of beavering away,
[5411.78 → 5413.14] seeing if you can do stuff on.
[5413.42 → 5417.28] And so you can make a little bit of progress on that so that whenever it's
[5417.28 → 5419.96] time to buy the real GPUs you actually want,
[5420.46 → 5421.60] you can point at that and go,
[5421.72 → 5421.86] okay,
[5421.88 → 5423.28] but we could also run it on this.
[5423.28 → 5425.58] So make sure that your price is competitive with this.
[5426.60 → 5431.46] That's as far as I can tell the only reason they even have it because
[5431.46 → 5433.14] they're doing all the real work.
[5433.22 → 5434.10] As far as I can tell,
[5434.24 → 5436.68] they wouldn't confirm this on NVIDIA.
[5438.40 → 5438.88] Dang.
[5439.10 → 5439.44] But Hey,
[5439.66 → 5442.06] this ties in nicely to our,
[5442.28 → 5444.44] he's winning somewhere to our next topic,
[5444.54 → 5445.20] which is,
[5445.20 → 5449.90] can you buy an Intel arc B580 for MSRP?
[5451.08 → 5453.46] The answer is yes.
[5453.52 → 5457.36] You can even get an Intel holiday bundle with purchase limited offer.
[5457.48 → 5459.06] What is the Intel holiday bundle?
[5459.22 → 5459.96] Let's find out.
[5460.14 → 5460.38] I don't know.
[5460.88 → 5462.00] Is it the same as last time?
[5462.02 → 5462.60] Where is it?
[5463.04 → 5463.54] What's the
[5463.54 → 5464.98] what's the holiday bundle?
[5464.98 → 5465.94] Can you just click on it?
[5466.04 → 5466.56] You butt.
[5466.72 → 5467.36] Can you click on it?
[5467.38 → 5467.56] No,
[5467.62 → 5467.96] I can't.
[5468.00 → 5468.78] I'm trying to click on it.
[5468.78 → 5468.88] No,
[5468.88 → 5469.30] not there.
[5469.44 → 5471.22] Down a little bit below the blue box.
[5471.42 → 5471.80] Right here.
[5472.00 → 5472.20] Oh,
[5472.30 → 5472.48] Intel.
[5472.48 → 5473.48] Oh,
[5473.48 → 5475.54] it's a bunch of stuff.
[5475.66 → 5475.74] Oh,
[5475.80 → 5477.10] you can get one of four games.
[5477.42 → 5477.70] Okay,
[5477.74 → 5477.98] cool.
[5478.08 → 5478.50] Dying light,
[5478.56 → 5478.86] the beast,
[5479.02 → 5479.42] Assassin's Creed,
[5479.50 → 5479.72] shadows,
[5479.84 → 5480.16] seven,
[5480.24 → 5480.78] and battlefield six.
[5480.82 → 5481.40] What are the other,
[5481.72 → 5482.28] what are the other things?
[5482.30 → 5482.72] It's live.
[5482.84 → 5483.94] That's the promo end date,
[5484.04 → 5484.96] January 31st,
[5484.98 → 5485.52] 2026.
[5485.74 → 5486.20] Let's go.
[5486.64 → 5487.46] Pick those games.
[5487.62 → 5488.14] Bonus content.
[5488.14 → 5488.28] Yeah,
[5488.28 → 5488.50] whatever.
[5488.62 → 5489.44] Who cares about any of this?
[5489.44 → 5490.54] It's in game garbage.
[5490.94 → 5490.96] Yeah,
[5490.96 → 5491.50] don't worry about it.
[5491.52 → 5491.80] But this,
[5491.94 → 5492.98] you can pick one of these.
[5493.36 → 5493.68] Nice.
[5493.92 → 5494.74] That's pretty cool.
[5495.02 → 5495.92] Intel holiday bundle.
[5496.08 → 5498.94] I think this is the same one they had before.
[5498.94 → 5499.10] Yeah,
[5499.10 → 5500.12] but it wasn't running for a bit.
[5500.12 → 5500.48] Yeah,
[5500.62 → 5501.46] so it's back.
[5501.72 → 5501.82] Well,
[5501.88 → 5501.98] no,
[5502.02 → 5503.00] if you look at the dates,
[5503.44 → 5503.78] it was,
[5503.94 → 5505.62] maybe they just pulled it off the site.
[5505.80 → 5507.12] They might have run out of coupons or something.
[5507.32 → 5507.60] Maybe.
[5507.62 → 5509.52] Because you know Intel has to pay for this,
[5509.56 → 5509.66] right?
[5509.66 → 5509.84] Yeah,
[5509.84 → 5510.10] yeah,
[5510.10 → 5510.22] yeah.
[5510.22 → 5515.08] That's the thing a lot of gamers might not necessarily have realized back in the day.
[5515.20 → 5515.32] Like,
[5515.34 → 5520.38] I remember having to admin these programs when we'd sell a GeForce GPU or Radeon GPU or whatever,
[5520.48 → 5521.04] and you get a
[5521.04 → 5524.42] you get like a coupon with a Metro Exodus or,
[5524.64 → 5524.80] you know,
[5524.90 → 5525.36] whatever,
[5525.50 → 5527.18] Metro 2033 code or whatever.
[5527.94 → 5528.84] Is that like,
[5529.42 → 5529.72] they,
[5529.72 → 5532.00] they buy copies of the games.
[5532.36 → 5536.24] So you can like run out of how many they bought.
[5536.46 → 5538.14] So they may have run short.
[5538.24 → 5539.12] They may have restocked.
[5539.14 → 5539.54] I don't know.
[5539.60 → 5544.80] Because I remember we did this one week, and it was running in Canada, and its like wasn't running
[5544.80 → 5545.64] on new egg or something.
[5545.74 → 5546.00] So,
[5546.00 → 5546.54] uh,
[5546.54 → 5546.72] Oh,
[5546.74 → 5546.92] right.
[5546.94 → 5547.98] What's our affiliate code?
[5548.16 → 5548.84] Just in case.
[5549.00 → 5549.42] Uh,
[5549.42 → 5550.14] does anyone remember?
[5550.26 → 5550.88] I don't remember.
[5551.04 → 5552.88] Java juice in full plane chat said pro tip.
[5552.96 → 5554.04] Don't pick Civ seven,
[5554.04 → 5554.44] uh,
[5554.56 → 5556.96] but Dan and full plane chat said zero out of 10 game.
[5556.96 → 5561.22] I would also throw my hat in the ring as a genuinely lifelong Civ fan.
[5561.74 → 5562.10] Uh,
[5562.70 → 5565.10] I would avoid it at least for now.
[5565.18 → 5566.30] My brother told me it sucks.
[5566.42 → 5566.60] Dude,
[5566.60 → 5568.68] it is not good.
[5568.86 → 5569.18] Okay.
[5569.32 → 5569.72] If,
[5569.72 → 5570.86] if Sean says it's bad,
[5570.92 → 5571.56] then it's bad.
[5571.74 → 5572.16] They need,
[5572.26 → 5572.86] or that's true.
[5573.00 → 5575.06] He's got like 10,000 hours.
[5575.06 → 5578.32] His hours in Civ got so high that in steam,
[5578.40 → 5582.94] it rolled over, and he went back down to zero and then kept going up, and he does not like
[5582.94 → 5583.46] Civ seven.
[5583.78 → 5584.00] Huh?
[5584.10 → 5584.22] Yeah.
[5584.28 → 5589.52] My brother was like super not into that.
[5589.62 → 5591.02] You're that you like,
[5591.60 → 5593.42] you can't just stay Genghis Khan the whole time.
[5593.42 → 5597.26] I knew exactly what he was going to say because that is garbage.
[5597.94 → 5598.64] I also don't,
[5598.78 → 5601.56] I think they got rid of one more turn as well.
[5601.80 → 5602.62] So it just kind of ends.
[5602.84 → 5603.88] Like you can't just keep,
[5603.88 → 5608.14] I didn't even know that part because I played exactly one campaign and when it ended,
[5608.26 → 5611.54] I quit immediately because I committed to doing it one time.
[5612.08 → 5612.94] And then,
[5613.24 → 5613.48] wow,
[5613.56 → 5616.52] there were so much fundamental bad.
[5616.68 → 5617.24] This was the first,
[5617.46 → 5618.34] every time,
[5618.40 → 5618.68] you know,
[5618.76 → 5620.90] Civ comes out and when you first get it,
[5620.98 → 5621.92] it's not going to be that great.
[5621.92 → 5623.82] And then the expansions tend to make it perfect.
[5624.00 → 5624.60] That's what it happens.
[5624.60 → 5626.44] Like every time Civ seven,
[5626.58 → 5628.06] I don't think they can save it.
[5628.18 → 5631.04] I think it is fundamentally like flawed as a game,
[5631.12 → 5633.62] which sucks.
[5633.62 → 5634.82] Cause there are a couple of good ideas.
[5634.98 → 5636.84] It's leg.GG slash new egg.
[5636.92 → 5638.98] If you guys want to pick up a B580.
[5639.52 → 5640.12] That makes sense.
[5640.18 → 5640.72] That's pretty easy.
[5640.78 → 5641.78] We should remember.
[5641.96 → 5643.06] I know I keep forgetting.
[5643.18 → 5643.60] Me too.
[5644.24 → 5644.64] Anyway,
[5644.68 → 5648.24] the point is you can pick up an Onyx Lump Arc B580,
[5648.42 → 5649.16] 12 gig.
[5649.28 → 5650.84] Remember 12 gigs VRAM.
[5650.92 → 5651.66] That's going to matter.
[5652.88 → 5653.56] 249.99.
[5653.56 → 5657.76] It is worth noting that these are a Gen 4 by 8 interface.
[5658.12 → 5661.96] So if you do not have a Gen 4 board, and it doesn't support rebar,
[5662.16 → 5664.82] I would not recommend a B580.
[5665.78 → 5668.08] Because if you have a Gen 3 board,
[5668.18 → 5671.78] you'll only be getting Gen 4 by 4 equivalent bandwidth.
[5672.04 → 5672.36] And it's,
[5672.46 → 5675.40] that's where you start maybe running into a little bit of trouble.
[5675.60 → 5676.78] And if you don't have rebar,
[5676.90 → 5678.14] you're going to have a pretty bad time.
[5678.24 → 5679.00] Resizable bar.
[5679.00 → 5679.90] Just check your BIOS.
[5679.98 → 5680.92] Make sure it supports it.
[5681.22 → 5683.48] You can also get an As rock Challenger Arc.
[5683.56 → 5685.54] That also qualifies for the holiday bundle.
[5685.66 → 5688.48] So you can get Battlefield 6 or some other games.
[5688.98 → 5690.68] But probably Battlefield 6.
[5690.84 → 5694.44] You can also get the Intel first party card for 249.99.
[5694.62 → 5695.98] That also has the holiday bundle.
[5696.50 → 5702.40] Lots and lots of options for Arc B580s for 249.99 MSRP.
[5703.48 → 5704.46] Seriously though,
[5706.38 → 5708.02] now is the time.
[5708.02 → 5713.76] because DRAM price increases are going to impact everything that has a DRAM chip in it.
[5714.58 → 5716.02] And that includes GPUs.
[5716.62 → 5726.56] I think the new year is going to be a serious hangover for GPU sales when pricing starts to increase again.
[5727.02 → 5728.72] Just for a point of clarification,
[5728.88 → 5729.64] I don't know what matters that much.
[5729.70 → 5730.76] We're not a game review thing,
[5730.84 → 5731.26] but whatever.
[5731.70 → 5732.40] Abba Juice said,
[5732.46 → 5733.30] you can keep the leader,
[5733.40 → 5734.52] but the sieve changes.
[5734.52 → 5736.50] So you could still play as Genghis Khan,
[5736.58 → 5738.54] but you become the leader of a different civilization.
[5738.70 → 5739.70] That does sound correct.
[5739.76 → 5740.48] That's even dumber.
[5740.62 → 5741.72] It's very stupid.
[5741.88 → 5742.04] Sorry,
[5742.14 → 5743.26] I haven't played it.
[5743.30 → 5744.86] So I was just going based on my brother.
[5745.40 → 5747.76] We went to visit him a little while back,
[5747.76 → 5750.50] and he was just like going off about like what a piece of shit it was.
[5750.50 → 5754.70] It is also like wipes all your troops and like spawns new ones and stuff.
[5754.82 → 5755.18] What?
[5755.18 → 5756.64] When the like age changes.
[5756.94 → 5757.78] It's very,
[5758.10 → 5758.76] very weird.
[5759.36 → 5760.22] It's super,
[5760.42 → 5760.90] super weird.
[5761.04 → 5764.46] I haven't like really played a sieve game since sieve two.
[5764.70 → 5765.82] So yeah.
[5765.82 → 5769.14] They've all operated on the same kind of idea.
[5769.34 → 5775.34] I just know that Great Wall of China early is OP so that nobody can start a war with you.
[5775.42 → 5783.96] Then you go get Leonardo's workshop so that all your crap garbage tier phalanxes or whatever that you build will become like riflemen.
[5784.24 → 5788.34] And then you go hard into science and then you win.
[5789.76 → 5790.66] That's all I know.
[5791.84 → 5793.48] Things have changed a little bit since sieve two.
[5794.56 → 5795.02] See,
[5795.10 → 5795.52] there you go.
[5795.52 → 5795.92] But yeah,
[5795.98 → 5796.42] it was,
[5796.54 → 5802.56] this was like the biggest change I would say in the sieve line was sieve seven.
[5802.76 → 5803.62] And a lot of the change,
[5803.70 → 5805.48] some of the change was kind of cool.
[5805.64 → 5807.56] A lot of the change was terrible.
[5810.42 → 5811.14] Chara says,
[5811.24 → 5811.52] but hey,
[5811.54 → 5812.98] you can sail through rivers,
[5812.98 → 5814.36] so it's all worth it.
[5815.54 → 5816.22] All right.
[5816.66 → 5817.98] That part is kind of neat.
[5818.60 → 5819.06] All right.
[5819.16 → 5819.34] Cool.
[5819.44 → 5819.56] Yeah.
[5819.64 → 5819.72] I mean,
[5819.72 → 5822.00] I could see that being not worth the downsides.
[5822.12 → 5823.48] I could see that being kind of at all.
[5824.38 → 5824.78] Cool.
[5824.78 → 5825.38] That'd be cool.
[5825.38 → 5826.84] You can,
[5826.92 → 5827.96] you can sail in rivers,
[5828.04 → 5828.24] right?
[5828.92 → 5829.32] Yeah.
[5829.32 → 5833.74] I was very frustrated,
[5834.12 → 5835.64] but it is what it is.
[5835.88 → 5836.10] Oops.
[5836.20 → 5836.38] Oh,
[5836.44 → 5836.60] shoot.
[5836.66 → 5836.86] I just,
[5836.92 → 5837.26] man,
[5837.34 → 5839.32] what's the open up the last tab I closed?
[5839.42 → 5839.98] I always forget.
[5839.98 → 5840.22] They need,
[5840.22 → 5841.38] they need Luigi back,
[5841.46 → 5841.62] dude.
[5841.84 → 5842.42] They need,
[5842.54 → 5842.76] I,
[5842.86 → 5843.26] that was,
[5843.26 → 5844.88] I forgot that was my conclusion,
[5845.00 → 5845.42] but it was,
[5845.50 → 5846.88] they need Luigi back.
[5847.30 → 5847.54] Like,
[5847.62 → 5848.38] like that Luigi?
[5848.54 → 5848.72] Yeah,
[5848.72 → 5849.22] that's right.
[5849.32 → 5850.30] He worked on Civ,
[5850.86 → 5853.34] and he did UX stuff.
[5853.74 → 5855.86] And the UX in Civ 7 is terrible.
[5855.86 → 5856.40] He could,
[5856.46 → 5858.28] he could do UX design from prison,
[5858.36 → 5858.52] right?
[5858.60 → 5859.62] They should let him do that.
[5860.30 → 5860.54] I mean,
[5860.60 → 5861.22] it might help.
[5861.30 → 5862.72] It might save that company.
[5863.58 → 5865.74] If there was a Luigi expansion to Civ 7.
[5865.74 → 5865.96] Yeah,
[5866.16 → 5866.78] like if he,
[5866.92 → 5869.34] if he kills one company,
[5869.46 → 5870.38] but saves another,
[5870.72 → 5874.00] does he go net neutral?
[5874.12 → 5874.86] Does it work that way?
[5874.86 → 5875.66] Does it come out in the wash?
[5876.00 → 5876.86] I think in this case,
[5876.90 → 5877.92] he's definitely in a positive.
[5879.20 → 5881.22] I am not taking a stance on that.
[5882.56 → 5883.22] That's fine.
[5886.08 → 5886.44] Anyway,
[5886.70 → 5886.86] yeah,
[5886.98 → 5887.30] let him,
[5887.30 → 5888.80] let him work from prison.
[5888.98 → 5889.50] Let him fix,
[5889.62 → 5890.12] let him fix,
[5890.12 → 5891.22] let him fix,
[5891.22 → 5892.70] let him fix Civ 7.
[5892.72 → 5893.82] That'd be awesome.
[5894.58 → 5895.94] It sounds a lot like 6-7.
[5896.02 → 5897.08] The kids will get behind it.
[5897.70 → 5898.14] I'm,
[5898.26 → 5898.54] uh,
[5898.78 → 5899.12] yeah,
[5899.22 → 5899.72] uh,
[5899.72 → 5900.06] yeah,
[5900.24 → 5900.52] yeah.
[5900.62 → 5901.04] I mean,
[5901.28 → 5901.68] wow.
[5901.84 → 5902.10] Yeah.
[5902.32 → 5902.68] Um,
[5902.78 → 5904.82] we can move on.
[5905.00 → 5905.44] All right.
[5905.52 → 5905.84] Cool.
[5906.00 → 5906.16] Yeah,
[5906.16 → 5907.38] that's probably good.
[5907.76 → 5908.20] How,
[5908.30 → 5909.80] how is his case going anyway?
[5910.54 → 5910.82] I'm,
[5910.82 → 5911.40] I'm sure the
[5911.50 → 5913.22] I'm sure the kids are keeping up with it.
[5914.18 → 5914.98] Hopefully well.
[5916.22 → 5916.68] Wow,
[5916.72 → 5917.26] that's crazy.
[5917.36 → 5919.68] He's actually the first autocomplete for Luigi.
[5919.94 → 5920.50] Not like,
[5920.58 → 5920.84] you know,
[5920.94 → 5921.56] that Luigi.
[5921.56 → 5922.92] Um,
[5923.60 → 5923.94] here,
[5924.00 → 5924.12] yeah,
[5924.20 → 5924.58] update.
[5924.68 → 5926.18] Update is one of my autocompletes.
[5926.26 → 5926.48] Okay.
[5926.64 → 5927.48] Pre-trial hearing,
[5927.60 → 5928.24] uh,
[5928.24 → 5929.42] postponed due to illness.
[5929.58 → 5929.92] Okay.
[5930.40 → 5931.54] So that's the
[5932.18 → 5932.90] um,
[5933.82 → 5934.20] oh,
[5934.40 → 5935.48] video shows.
[5936.10 → 5938.06] Luigi saying he didn't want to talk.
[5938.44 → 5940.32] Police kept asking questions.
[5941.20 → 5941.46] Hmm.
[5941.90 → 5942.38] Interesting.
[5942.38 → 5944.18] I think that's how that goes.
[5944.94 → 5945.26] Yeah.
[5945.44 → 5946.50] I think that's pretty normal.
[5947.00 → 5950.92] But if they can make the argument that he was like coerced in some way,
[5950.92 → 5951.90] um,
[5951.90 → 5953.82] and that it violated his,
[5953.82 → 5954.62] his rights,
[5954.62 → 5955.60] um,
[5955.60 → 5956.10] or whatever,
[5956.10 → 5956.48] then,
[5956.48 → 5957.28] I mean,
[5957.42 → 5961.06] we all know that it's at this point or not at this point,
[5961.06 → 5963.06] we all know that in many cases,
[5963.06 → 5966.36] it's not about whether the person did it.
[5967.10 → 5967.54] Oh,
[5967.60 → 5967.86] yeah.
[5968.66 → 5968.92] Yeah.
[5968.92 → 5972.66] It's about whether they can find a loophole,
[5972.74 → 5973.40] right?
[5973.76 → 5974.12] Judicial,
[5974.22 → 5974.74] not justice.
[5974.98 → 5975.16] Yeah.
[5975.16 → 5975.96] you know,
[5975.98 → 5976.10] the
[5976.10 → 5977.36] the glove defence.
[5977.74 → 5978.08] Yeah.
[5978.64 → 5979.16] Um,
[5979.92 → 5982.06] anyway,
[5982.46 → 5983.52] uh,
[5983.70 → 5986.74] Roneo's next two has a massive battery.
[5986.92 → 5987.96] This is hilarious.
[5988.52 → 5989.16] Roneo,
[5989.26 → 5992.60] who are known for making windows handheld gaming devices announced their next
[5992.60 → 5997.76] two powered by the AMD Ryzen AI max plus three nine five,
[5997.90 → 6004.20] which is a really long name and draws 85 Watts features a 9.06-inch screen,
[6004.20 → 6009.52] 165 Hertz to 2400 by 15 Oh four OLED screen.
[6009.52 → 6015.86] And probably the craziest spec is the 115 watt-hour battery.
[6016.32 → 6021.52] That is literally so big that I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to take it on a
[6021.52 → 6021.82] plane.
[6022.94 → 6023.26] Uh,
[6023.26 → 6027.64] this battery size means that most airlines will require approval in order to
[6027.64 → 6030.54] allow that device to be brought on as a checked.
[6030.82 → 6031.26] Oh,
[6031.52 → 6033.32] well you don't put batteries in your checked anyway.
[6033.32 → 6033.56] No,
[6033.66 → 6034.40] forget checked.
[6034.52 → 6036.64] I don't think you could even bring this item.
[6037.16 → 6038.82] I'm pretty sure they mean cabin item.
[6039.14 → 6039.54] Uh,
[6039.62 → 6042.06] there is no pricing yet or full spec sheet,
[6042.40 → 6045.30] but Roneo stated that they will reveal more soon.
[6046.90 → 6047.34] Oh,
[6047.38 → 6048.16] sorry about that.
[6048.20 → 6048.58] I can,
[6048.68 → 6048.92] uh,
[6048.92 → 6050.24] I can turn that off.
[6050.24 → 6051.66] Um,
[6053.82 → 6054.96] sorry.
[6057.18 → 6057.32] Yeah.
[6057.36 → 6058.86] It is a unified doorbell.
[6058.96 → 6059.62] Don't worry about it.
[6059.74 → 6060.78] That's one of the reasons my,
[6060.84 → 6065.22] my laptop has two batteries in it instead of one giant battery.
[6065.22 → 6065.54] I don't know.
[6066.04 → 6071.82] Because two batteries is not one battery, and therefore it is below the limit.
[6071.94 → 6073.20] I definitely can take on a plane.
[6073.30 → 6076.32] If you total all the battery banks that I carry in my bag,
[6076.58 → 6077.56] I'm way above.
[6077.60 → 6078.06] Oh yeah.
[6078.30 → 6078.52] Yeah.
[6078.52 → 6081.02] So if they had put two giant batteries in it,
[6081.10 → 6081.82] you would be fine.
[6081.96 → 6082.60] But it's not,
[6082.68 → 6083.64] it's not about that.
[6083.70 → 6087.70] It's about how much energy is in like that one.
[6087.76 → 6088.18] It's like,
[6088.22 → 6088.44] it's,
[6088.52 → 6090.12] it's kind of like you could bring,
[6090.22 → 6090.88] you know,
[6090.98 → 6092.98] a hundred firecrackers in your car,
[6093.08 → 6094.74] but one grenade is a bigger problem.
[6094.88 → 6095.80] If that makes sense.
[6097.06 → 6097.46] Is,
[6097.56 → 6098.46] is like,
[6098.48 → 6101.58] it is a function of just like how much energy and stuff,
[6101.58 → 6102.32] uh,
[6102.32 → 6104.20] will set off lithium-ion batteries really fast,
[6104.20 → 6104.62] but does,
[6104.86 → 6106.50] does another thing on fire?
[6106.50 → 6108.14] I believe it doesn't help.
[6108.26 → 6108.38] Yeah.
[6108.54 → 6108.86] Yeah.
[6109.04 → 6109.56] Because it's,
[6109.60 → 6109.82] it's,
[6109.86 → 6112.34] it's reaching the thermal runaway point is where you,
[6112.48 → 6113.34] where you run into trouble.
[6113.92 → 6114.32] Um,
[6114.64 → 6115.12] uh,
[6115.12 → 6115.56] another,
[6115.84 → 6116.18] Oh shoot.
[6116.22 → 6118.62] I was thinking there was something I was going to say too about,
[6118.70 → 6118.94] Oh yeah.
[6118.94 → 6122.06] Another major factor that I didn't think about until I had to research this.
[6122.06 → 6124.82] Because I got my battery bank confiscated on that last trip to China,
[6124.82 → 6127.96] but the actual state of charge matters a bunch,
[6127.96 → 6129.86] which makes sense.
[6129.86 → 6130.02] Yeah,
[6130.02 → 6130.44] it does.
[6130.44 → 6131.56] If you think about it,
[6131.66 → 6133.38] I'm surprised they're willing to even bother.
[6133.52 → 6133.68] No,
[6133.74 → 6134.14] they're not,
[6134.36 → 6135.00] but I just,
[6135.08 → 6135.32] I was,
[6135.40 → 6136.48] I was just learning about it.
[6136.50 → 6136.92] I understand.
[6137.08 → 6137.40] Um,
[6137.40 → 6142.22] and I didn't realize that it's way safer to travel with your batteries discharged,
[6142.22 → 6144.28] which totally,
[6144.70 → 6146.08] totally makes sense.
[6146.14 → 6146.52] It does.
[6146.58 → 6149.08] Cause there's like way less energy in it.
[6149.26 → 6149.50] Yeah.
[6149.58 → 6149.98] Um,
[6150.54 → 6151.04] but I just,
[6151.10 → 6152.32] I never thought about that before.
[6152.38 → 6152.50] Yeah,
[6152.50 → 6152.76] me either.
[6152.90 → 6153.16] Yeah.
[6154.86 → 6155.34] Uh,
[6155.34 → 6156.12] you said something,
[6156.30 → 6158.46] Dan full plane announce.
[6158.46 → 6159.08] Oh yeah.
[6159.08 → 6162.70] I think we already did.
[6162.86 → 6163.36] I think,
[6163.44 → 6164.24] I think we did that.
[6164.30 → 6164.92] It's just funny.
[6165.30 → 6167.02] It has a giant battery in it.
[6167.08 → 6168.36] So you can't take it on the plane.
[6169.06 → 6170.90] Unless you had a gamer plane,
[6171.08 → 6173.10] then maybe you could.
[6173.38 → 6173.82] Wow.
[6173.94 → 6174.24] You could,
[6174.30 → 6174.66] then you could,
[6174.72 → 6178.08] cause the only justification you'd need is so that I can game.
[6178.78 → 6181.16] I'm going to game hard and long.
[6181.16 → 6181.80] And fast.
[6181.92 → 6182.48] And fast.
[6184.88 → 6186.96] And strong because my,
[6187.06 → 6188.12] my poor forearms,
[6188.36 → 6188.92] I've been,
[6189.02 → 6189.22] uh,
[6189.22 → 6196.06] I've been using the GPD win five lately and I have found that it actually makes me want to game less.
[6196.56 → 6197.76] How much does it weigh?
[6198.00 → 6198.46] It's a good side of it.
[6198.78 → 6199.34] Uh,
[6199.52 → 6199.88] hold on.
[6199.88 → 6201.06] It's like a good couple pounds.
[6201.32 → 6202.88] GPD win five.
[6203.02 → 6203.54] Wait,
[6203.74 → 6205.48] let's see what the AI says.
[6206.14 → 6206.50] Uh,
[6206.62 → 6210.70] varies depending on whether the external battery is attached.
[6211.44 → 6211.88] Um,
[6212.12 → 6212.78] with the external,
[6212.94 → 6214.22] the total weight is about a kilo.
[6214.50 → 6214.68] Yeah.
[6214.70 → 6216.84] Just over two pounds according to AI,
[6217.00 → 6218.22] but that does sound about right.
[6218.80 → 6220.64] It's edentulous.
[6220.94 → 6223.74] Like I actually find myself because I'm,
[6223.74 → 6228.30] I'm supposed to be using it for a review and I might just give up because I,
[6228.30 → 6233.90] I go to my nightstand and I have my original DOG ally with the battery mod.
[6234.18 → 6236.36] So it's already a bit on the heavier side.
[6236.36 → 6237.06] Because I did the
[6237.12 → 6238.28] like the modded bigger battery.
[6238.28 → 6240.94] I have not upgraded to the X.
[6241.30 → 6241.82] I,
[6241.90 → 6242.34] um,
[6243.30 → 6245.16] you just not care.
[6246.02 → 6246.50] Yeah.
[6246.80 → 6247.04] Yeah.
[6247.40 → 6248.36] It's faster,
[6248.52 → 6249.98] but when I,
[6250.12 → 6250.46] like if,
[6250.56 → 6253.74] when I finally play clear obscure or something that I might,
[6253.92 → 6257.14] like when I play a game that actually demands more GPU,
[6257.14 → 6257.62] yeah,
[6257.70 → 6258.30] then I might.
[6258.30 → 6263.12] But lately the vast majority of my hours of handheld gaming have been Final Fantasy tactics,
[6263.78 → 6267.20] a PlayStation one game and tape to tape,
[6267.34 → 6268.84] which is barely even 3d.
[6268.98 → 6269.38] Yeah.
[6269.54 → 6272.16] So I just don't need it.
[6272.30 → 6272.70] Uh,
[6272.70 → 6275.06] so I've still been using my first gen ally.
[6275.06 → 6277.84] Like if they bring me a better display or something like,
[6277.94 → 6278.36] come on,
[6278.40 → 6278.56] man,
[6278.64 → 6281.02] do something that matters to me, and I'll upgrade it.
[6281.02 → 6281.32] It's just,
[6281.68 → 6282.18] I don't even,
[6282.36 → 6284.28] cause like I could just grab one from the warehouse,
[6284.28 → 6291.02] but it's not even worth just like resetting up windows and downloading my games for the difference
[6291.02 → 6292.62] that it would make in gameplay to me right now.
[6292.62 → 6293.22] So anyway,
[6293.34 → 6293.62] so anyway,
[6293.66 → 6294.62] the point is in my nightstand,
[6294.74 → 6295.82] I've got my,
[6295.90 → 6299.76] I've got my RG ally, and then I've got the GPD win five right now.
[6300.46 → 6302.28] And so to just bricks.
[6302.46 → 6302.86] Uh,
[6302.86 → 6303.68] and I just,
[6303.84 → 6304.74] I just,
[6304.82 → 6305.24] I'm like,
[6305.28 → 6306.78] ah,
[6307.06 → 6310.82] I could grab that, and I could use it.
[6310.82 → 6318.36] And then I could make notes for the review, or I could just enjoy playing my games more.
[6318.50 → 6322.44] I feel like noting the amount of times that that happens is part of the review.
[6323.62 → 6324.06] Yeah.
[6324.40 → 6325.22] Like if you're like,
[6325.26 → 6330.10] I very consistently chose a lighter option.
[6330.26 → 6330.68] Maybe 50%.
[6330.68 → 6330.98] Yeah.
[6331.12 → 6332.22] 50% of the time.
[6332.28 → 6333.10] You know what though?
[6333.28 → 6334.72] I haven't,
[6334.74 → 6335.92] because it's kind of a pain.
[6336.00 → 6336.52] It's like a
[6336.52 → 6338.32] it's like a screw type mechanism.
[6338.56 → 6339.14] You can,
[6339.20 → 6340.88] you can hook up the battery on a tether.
[6341.52 → 6343.98] So I haven't bothered hooking it up like that yet.
[6343.98 → 6345.52] Because it's kind of stupid.
[6346.16 → 6346.60] Um,
[6347.00 → 6348.56] and it's just like,
[6348.58 → 6350.94] it is another level of the inconvenience.
[6350.94 → 6353.44] It's like now I have weight and inconvenience.
[6353.80 → 6354.04] Yeah.
[6354.12 → 6356.58] But what I'm going to do is I was going to use it with the
[6356.58 → 6359.42] the pack attached to the back for a while and like,
[6359.42 → 6361.14] see how I feel about that.
[6361.20 → 6361.70] Try the tether.
[6361.70 → 6365.20] And then I was going to move to the tether and then see if that changes my habits.
[6365.20 → 6367.96] It feels kind of like 90s sick to,
[6367.96 → 6370.00] to have a battery pack,
[6370.10 → 6370.96] external battery pack.
[6370.96 → 6376.68] The 90s was objectively a terrible time for battery powered mobile electronics.
[6377.02 → 6377.30] No,
[6377.42 → 6378.06] it wasn't.
[6378.14 → 6378.48] It was awesome.
[6378.48 → 6382.52] Remember when you had to put like four double A's into the handle of a
[6382.52 → 6383.58] of a digital camera?
[6383.84 → 6385.48] Like that was not good.
[6385.64 → 6386.16] It was awesome.
[6386.18 → 6386.90] That was bad.
[6386.96 → 6388.42] And that was the 2000s.
[6388.74 → 6389.00] Man,
[6389.08 → 6389.54] I remember,
[6389.66 → 6391.78] I remember this RC car that I had.
[6391.94 → 6392.10] No,
[6392.10 → 6395.00] I've talked about that on the WAN show before I even found a picture of it.
[6395.90 → 6399.24] Monster six by six RC car or something like that.
[6399.30 → 6399.64] Where is it?
[6399.66 → 6400.02] Where is it?
[6400.06 → 6400.44] There's like,
[6400.52 → 6406.16] there's this thing that's like the 90s and very early 2000s was a point in time
[6406.16 → 6408.70] where technology was like awesome and made your life better,
[6408.70 → 6414.44] but it wasn't like so good or all consuming that it also attempted to ruin your life.
[6414.48 → 6415.10] And I,
[6415.10 → 6416.34] I embrace that a lot.
[6416.42 → 6419.72] I think part of like batteries being kind of bad is like,
[6419.78 → 6419.88] yeah,
[6419.88 → 6422.72] your thing dies, and then you probably want to go do something else,
[6422.74 → 6424.32] which is like potentially a good thing.
[6425.10 → 6425.46] Man,
[6425.48 → 6426.50] I can't find it again,
[6426.50 → 6426.84] but I,
[6426.96 → 6427.68] it was like this,
[6427.68 → 6431.82] like six wheel RC cars here at 90s.
[6431.86 → 6432.10] Let's try.
[6432.18 → 6432.42] Oh yeah,
[6432.42 → 6432.80] here it is.
[6432.82 → 6432.96] Yeah,
[6432.96 → 6433.12] yeah,
[6433.12 → 6433.28] yeah,
[6433.28 → 6433.44] yeah.
[6433.44 → 6433.88] This thing,
[6434.36 → 6434.70] this,
[6434.84 → 6435.84] this piece of shit.
[6436.08 → 6436.52] Oh,
[6436.66 → 6437.88] I pressed the wrong thing.
[6437.96 → 6438.16] Whoops.
[6438.30 → 6438.86] What is this?
[6438.98 → 6439.44] Someone like,
[6439.58 → 6446.34] the point is this piece of garbage took like 12 double A batteries or something like
[6446.34 → 6446.58] that.
[6446.88 → 6447.20] Hell yeah.
[6447.30 → 6449.60] And the rechargeable that we had back then,
[6449.60 → 6451.28] were not very good.
[6451.38 → 6451.60] No.
[6451.70 → 6453.40] So they didn't last very long.
[6453.74 → 6454.20] Um,
[6454.62 → 6458.32] and even disposables like barely lasted in this thing.
[6458.32 → 6459.54] Metro Scorcher.
[6459.82 → 6461.36] Six by six.
[6461.86 → 6465.30] Fastest turbo 360 degree spins ever.
[6465.30 → 6469.08] And also only the middle wheels drove.
[6469.22 → 6470.94] That's why it could spin really well.
[6471.60 → 6472.08] Um,
[6472.50 → 6472.90] man,
[6472.98 → 6473.54] where's the
[6474.04 → 6477.10] this might be a later version of it because mine definitely,
[6477.10 → 6479.96] mine definitely took double A batteries.
[6480.08 → 6481.20] I miss everything being turbo.
[6481.44 → 6482.10] I like turbo.
[6482.32 → 6482.54] Turbo.
[6482.54 → 6483.12] Turbo is a good word.
[6483.12 → 6483.70] Turbo-tactic.
[6483.96 → 6484.20] Yeah.
[6484.44 → 6484.74] Um,
[6484.74 → 6485.02] anyway,
[6485.02 → 6486.14] I also had,
[6486.26 → 6486.78] uh,
[6486.78 → 6487.98] I also had one of these,
[6487.98 → 6488.62] uh,
[6488.72 → 6490.76] ricochet RC car.
[6490.76 → 6492.74] This thing ran for like,
[6493.30 → 6494.16] I want to say,
[6494.28 → 6494.78] or did I have,
[6494.94 → 6496.86] I had either the ricochet or the rebound.
[6496.94 → 6503.68] This thing was super cool because it could flip over, and then you could keep driving it as long as you could,
[6503.68 → 6504.96] could do it backwards.
[6504.96 → 6505.30] Yeah.
[6505.30 → 6505.36] Yeah.
[6505.36 → 6505.56] Yeah.
[6505.56 → 6505.74] Yeah.
[6505.74 → 6505.88] Yeah.
[6505.88 → 6506.08] Yeah.
[6506.08 → 6506.58] Um,
[6507.60 → 6507.96] that's cool.
[6508.06 → 6509.14] There's some finesse in that.
[6509.16 → 6509.26] Yeah.
[6509.26 → 6510.52] It ran for like six minutes.
[6510.68 → 6511.36] Hell yeah.
[6511.38 → 6511.90] On battery.
[6512.00 → 6512.88] It was so dumb.
[6513.18 → 6513.94] Hell yeah.
[6514.24 → 6514.64] 90s,
[6514.72 → 6518.04] 90s battery powered electronics were objectively terrible.
[6518.20 → 6518.30] Nope.
[6518.30 → 6519.64] And I will die on that hill.
[6519.74 → 6519.94] Nope.
[6520.24 → 6521.48] I will die on that hill.
[6521.58 → 6521.98] Disagree.
[6522.08 → 6526.00] I'm dead now then because realistically I wasn't going to win a fight between us.
[6527.58 → 6528.38] Way to go,
[6528.48 → 6528.70] Luke.
[6528.78 → 6529.74] You killed me.
[6530.50 → 6532.30] Mark this day in your calendar,
[6532.50 → 6532.74] folks.
[6532.84 → 6534.90] This is the anniversary of my death.
[6534.96 → 6535.32] Uh,
[6537.72 → 6538.32] uh,
[6538.32 → 6540.26] speaking of things that make me want to die,
[6540.38 → 6540.62] uh,
[6540.66 → 6541.24] no notes,
[6541.38 → 6545.14] 60 million yen human washing machines revealed.
[6545.52 → 6545.92] Uh,
[6545.92 → 6546.74] this is so funny,
[6546.80 → 6547.56] which by the way,
[6547.62 → 6555.10] 60 million yen is $386,759 and 94 cents in USD.
[6556.22 → 6556.82] It's a
[6556.90 → 6559.96] like a shower that you sit slash lay down in.
[6560.04 → 6560.20] Okay.
[6560.26 → 6560.42] I,
[6560.42 → 6560.70] I,
[6560.70 → 6563.06] I low-key love the name of this company though.
[6563.38 → 6564.60] They're just called science.
[6565.84 → 6566.94] That's kind of awesome.
[6567.06 → 6567.22] Yeah,
[6567.28 → 6568.16] I do give them that.
[6568.22 → 6568.62] Hold on.
[6568.68 → 6568.96] Luke,
[6569.42 → 6570.26] hear me out.
[6570.38 → 6570.70] No,
[6570.94 → 6572.60] this Mira,
[6572.70 → 6572.82] no,
[6572.88 → 6574.80] just open-minded for a second.
[6574.94 → 6575.04] Just,
[6575.08 → 6575.20] just,
[6575.20 → 6575.78] just,
[6575.78 → 6575.84] just,
[6575.98 → 6576.10] okay.
[6576.10 → 6576.36] Look,
[6576.56 → 6576.78] okay.
[6576.82 → 6577.38] Open minded.
[6577.60 → 6578.12] Brain is open.
[6578.32 → 6578.58] Open mind.
[6578.68 → 6579.34] Don't worry about this.
[6579.56 → 6579.76] Don't worry.
[6579.82 → 6580.82] Just be brain open.
[6580.82 → 6581.10] Okay.
[6581.98 → 6584.76] The Mira human washing machine.
[6584.98 → 6585.32] Mm-hmm.
[6585.40 → 6585.74] Okay.
[6586.52 → 6587.12] Mm-hmm.
[6587.86 → 6592.78] Can shower and dry a person simply by them lying down in it.
[6593.06 → 6593.38] Uh-huh.
[6593.60 → 6595.46] In about 15 minutes.
[6595.60 → 6597.24] Which there is some like excessive,
[6597.46 → 6597.90] Oh man,
[6597.96 → 6598.86] that's not even fast.
[6598.94 → 6599.72] I know,
[6599.82 → 6600.14] right?
[6600.92 → 6603.26] I'm pretty sure I showered faster than that this morning.
[6603.26 → 6607.32] That is the very first paragraph of this article on the chosen.
[6607.32 → 6611.34] If you just like focus on the task at hand,
[6611.42 → 6613.38] you can just do that faster in a normal shower.
[6613.46 → 6613.82] Is this,
[6613.82 → 6614.42] is this,
[6614.42 → 6618.90] is this supposed to be impressive that you can shower in 15 minutes?
[6619.14 → 6622.46] There is potentially some accessibility coolness.
[6622.54 → 6623.02] Sure.
[6623.28 → 6623.56] In this.
[6623.74 → 6623.96] Sure.
[6624.06 → 6625.42] And the way it does it is cool.
[6625.74 → 6628.92] Like it almost sounds like an ultrasonic cleaner or something.
[6629.12 → 6637.30] Apparently it uses ultra fine micro bubbles invisible to the naked eye to penetrate deep into the pores to remove impurity.
[6637.30 → 6639.30] Such as dead skin cells and sebum.
[6640.02 → 6640.12] Sure.
[6640.46 → 6640.62] Um,
[6641.52 → 6649.46] sensors installed on the back detect health status and videos and music are played to help users relax during the cleansing process.
[6649.66 → 6649.68] Yeah,
[6649.68 → 6652.30] I just turned the volume of my phone up and leave it outside the shower.
[6652.58 → 6652.60] Well,
[6652.62 → 6652.94] yeah,
[6653.06 → 6653.84] you could do that.
[6654.52 → 6655.24] You could do that.
[6656.52 → 6656.92] Yeah.
[6657.08 → 6657.76] Do be clear.
[6657.84 → 6659.08] This is not a real product.
[6659.20 → 6661.98] They're making like a few dozen of them, and it's for like,
[6662.12 → 6665.36] it's meant to be a novelty item for commercial installations.
[6665.80 → 6666.94] I do know like,
[6667.04 → 6667.50] you know,
[6667.56 → 6670.18] old folks homes or limited mobility people,
[6670.36 → 6670.66] et cetera.
[6671.02 → 6671.08] Sure.
[6671.26 → 6671.70] Uh,
[6671.70 → 6673.46] showering can be a
[6673.80 → 6676.80] this would not be the right form factor for that though.
[6676.82 → 6676.98] Like,
[6677.00 → 6679.34] I don't know if you've ever seen like a senior's bath.
[6679.52 → 6679.68] Yeah.
[6679.68 → 6680.78] They need like the little door.
[6680.82 → 6681.02] Yeah.
[6681.02 → 6682.22] You have a door, and you like,
[6682.22 → 6683.66] this looks like you have to climb into it.
[6683.66 → 6683.84] Yeah.
[6683.88 → 6685.10] So this is like,
[6685.74 → 6685.86] this,
[6686.02 → 6691.68] I do like the idea of like automated human washing thing,
[6691.68 → 6693.16] because I do know that it can,
[6693.24 → 6693.94] it can be like,
[6694.06 → 6694.50] uh,
[6694.72 → 6695.00] man,
[6695.00 → 6696.02] I don't even really want to say it,
[6696.02 → 6697.82] but it can be like embarrassing for,
[6697.92 → 6700.36] for people to have to be like washed by someone else.
[6700.46 → 6707.26] Steven J says that clean time is the equivalent of saying this computer will boot in just the time it takes for you to eat breakfast.
[6707.46 → 6707.94] It's like,
[6708.04 → 6708.42] yeah,
[6708.42 → 6710.26] like if I'm in a hurry,
[6710.26 → 6712.60] I can be in and out of the shower in about three minutes.
[6712.60 → 6716.66] I know this from my years in high school of getting up at the last possible.
[6716.66 → 6717.10] What are your,
[6717.16 → 6717.42] what are your,
[6717.50 → 6718.70] if you're going down to three minutes,
[6718.70 → 6718.92] you're,
[6718.98 → 6720.32] you're probably giving something up.
[6720.34 → 6720.68] So what are you,
[6720.68 → 6721.12] what are you doing?
[6721.60 → 6722.00] Uh,
[6722.04 → 6722.76] at three minutes,
[6722.76 → 6723.58] I'm not conditioning.
[6723.80 → 6724.74] I'll tell you that much.
[6724.74 → 6724.82] Yeah.
[6724.98 → 6728.40] And I'm probably using shampoo for body watch.
[6728.62 → 6728.76] Yeah.
[6728.84 → 6729.04] Yeah.
[6729.04 → 6729.20] Yeah.
[6729.48 → 6729.72] Yeah.
[6729.72 → 6730.08] So,
[6730.24 → 6730.74] so I,
[6730.82 → 6731.12] so yeah,
[6731.18 → 6732.46] it's going down to hard requirements.
[6732.46 → 6733.62] We're down to one soap.
[6733.78 → 6734.02] Yeah.
[6734.20 → 6735.50] And no conditioner.
[6735.70 → 6735.92] Yeah.
[6736.16 → 6736.42] And,
[6736.50 → 6737.04] and then are you,
[6737.04 → 6741.06] are you like lathering in the hair and then like taking that and going elsewhere?
[6741.26 → 6741.44] No,
[6741.56 → 6742.56] you've got time to squirt.
[6742.56 → 6744.68] You've got time to squirt another pump before,
[6744.86 → 6746.74] before you do the pits and the elsewhere.
[6747.02 → 6747.54] There's no,
[6747.54 → 6750.98] there's no way you're doing like a full body lather at that speed though.
[6751.62 → 6751.84] Yeah.
[6751.84 → 6752.96] But I would throw in feet.
[6753.12 → 6753.60] You got to do,
[6753.72 → 6754.86] you kind of got to do your feet.
[6754.94 → 6755.62] You got to do feet.
[6755.76 → 6755.94] Yeah.
[6756.06 → 6756.28] Yeah.
[6756.28 → 6757.50] There's no way to skip the feet.
[6757.70 → 6757.86] Yeah.
[6762.40 → 6762.80] Good,
[6762.80 → 6763.58] good way.
[6763.70 → 6764.22] Show conversation.
[6764.22 → 6764.44] Yeah.
[6764.44 → 6766.16] We just saved you 60 million yen.
[6766.28 → 6766.76] You're welcome.
[6767.04 → 6769.02] And a lot of,
[6769.14 → 6769.34] I mean,
[6769.36 → 6771.22] that's five times faster or something.
[6771.84 → 6772.40] Oh yeah.
[6772.56 → 6774.22] Time to do the float plane announcements.
[6775.00 → 6775.24] Uh,
[6775.24 → 6778.24] we had a little throwback Thursday on float plane this week.
[6778.32 → 6779.16] Do you want to fire up float plane?
[6779.30 → 6779.62] Yeah.
[6779.82 → 6782.96] With three amazing exclusives.
[6783.10 → 6783.90] Oh no,
[6784.04 → 6784.88] this one's up.
[6784.88 → 6785.98] We've first,
[6785.98 → 6788.28] we've got me react.
[6788.28 → 6789.28] The exclusives are on the
[6789.34 → 6789.44] yeah,
[6789.46 → 6789.80] there you go.
[6790.10 → 6790.42] First,
[6790.50 → 6795.12] we've got me reacting to staff's first time meeting me that released on Monday.
[6795.12 → 6801.66] And it's safe to say that people like seeing me in uncomfortable social situations.
[6801.66 → 6802.22] Oh yeah,
[6802.22 → 6802.58] they do.
[6803.62 → 6804.76] They like it a lot.
[6805.38 → 6811.90] Or mostly they like me recalling times that I created uncomfortable social situations.
[6812.12 → 6812.98] Linus is suffering.
[6815.38 → 6816.22] Oh boy.
[6816.22 → 6816.70] Yeah.
[6816.70 → 6819.44] That's all just screen grabs from the video.
[6819.54 → 6821.42] That is not me posing for the thumbnail.
[6821.60 → 6823.62] I did not know that Sammy was going to do that.
[6823.72 → 6824.74] I saw the thumbnail.
[6825.84 → 6826.24] Um,
[6826.32 → 6826.66] anyway,
[6826.78 → 6827.74] Colton's in there.
[6827.94 → 6828.92] Yvonne's in there.
[6829.92 → 6830.36] There's,
[6830.48 → 6831.94] there are some good ones.
[6832.12 → 6832.38] All right.
[6832.38 → 6838.18] My problem with ours is I think I'd have to watch back us talking about it like years ago.
[6838.18 → 6841.02] Because I only remember like some of the details at this point.
[6841.08 → 6841.26] Yeah,
[6841.28 → 6841.84] that was a long,
[6841.98 → 6842.88] that was a long time ago.
[6843.60 → 6843.92] Uh,
[6844.08 → 6849.08] we also had a section of the writers discuss Linus's hot takes,
[6849.22 → 6849.82] um,
[6850.34 → 6852.38] where they discuss wireless peripherals.
[6853.06 → 6854.12] And finally,
[6855.16 → 6855.52] Luke,
[6855.90 → 6857.64] did you know that Pouffe,
[6858.04 → 6862.36] who owns a display has been at the company for almost five years now?
[6862.38 → 6864.44] I honestly thought it had been longer,
[6864.44 → 6866.86] but I know that as of yesterday,
[6866.86 → 6867.62] because,
[6867.74 → 6868.00] uh,
[6868.00 → 6868.68] Christmas party.
[6868.86 → 6869.04] Yeah.
[6869.14 → 6871.04] We took a look back at his first videos,
[6871.12 → 6871.52] what he wrote,
[6871.60 → 6873.32] hosted and so on and so forth.
[6873.40 → 6874.68] All of this is at our new link.
[6875.10 → 6878.36] LEG.GG slash F P WAN.
[6879.20 → 6879.64] Um,
[6880.32 → 6880.88] okay.
[6881.08 → 6881.92] And both,
[6882.26 → 6883.14] but man,
[6883.38 → 6883.72] Sammy,
[6884.00 → 6887.02] you are such a unique human.
[6888.40 → 6889.36] Look at this.
[6889.54 → 6889.98] He is.
[6890.32 → 6890.90] Look at this.
[6892.38 → 6897.34] under cap and uppercase.
[6899.82 → 6900.38] Huh.
[6901.46 → 6903.62] Who would think to write that like that?
[6905.00 → 6905.52] Under cap.
[6909.06 → 6911.04] It feels very Sammy.
[6911.40 → 6912.34] I don't know why,
[6912.66 → 6913.20] but it does.
[6913.20 → 6913.50] You know why?
[6913.60 → 6915.84] It's because that's what he sounds like when he talks.
[6915.84 → 6920.84] You know,
[6920.90 → 6921.14] yeah,
[6921.28 → 6921.48] yeah.
[6921.54 → 6922.36] Uppercase works,
[6922.66 → 6923.58] upper cap works,
[6923.58 → 6923.84] no cap,
[6923.84 → 6924.92] under cap,
[6924.92 → 6926.12] under cap is good,
[6926.18 → 6926.62] no cap.
[6926.70 → 6926.96] You'll be,
[6927.08 → 6927.62] you'll be all right.
[6927.66 → 6928.26] Just rip a pack,
[6928.34 → 6928.48] dude.
[6929.04 → 6929.94] Just rip a pack.
[6931.30 → 6931.66] Literally,
[6931.84 → 6933.16] he did that at the Christmas party.
[6933.54 → 6934.56] On stage,
[6934.72 → 6935.64] he is just like,
[6935.84 → 6937.40] opened up a pack of Pokémon cards.
[6937.40 → 6940.08] Just actively lost money on stage in front of everyone.
[6940.20 → 6940.38] Yeah.
[6940.54 → 6940.70] I,
[6940.76 → 6943.20] I didn't really comprehend what I was watching.
[6943.32 → 6943.78] It was awesome.
[6943.94 → 6944.08] We,
[6944.14 → 6944.52] we do,
[6944.62 → 6945.06] we do,
[6945.18 → 6946.24] we do kind of,
[6946.32 → 6946.66] um,
[6946.84 → 6947.78] team themes.
[6947.88 → 6948.58] We do kind of like,
[6948.72 → 6948.86] uh,
[6948.88 → 6949.20] like a
[6949.24 → 6949.40] it's,
[6949.50 → 6956.26] it's somewhere between dress up and like doing like a grade six class presentation.
[6956.80 → 6957.52] Um,
[6957.78 → 6958.72] it's a good way to describe it.
[6958.72 → 6959.20] And,
[6959.20 → 6959.56] uh,
[6959.64 → 6962.92] Sammy's team was based on one of our core values,
[6962.92 → 6964.58] which is level up together.
[6964.84 → 6965.92] So their team,
[6966.00 → 6967.42] which was actually also Luke's team,
[6967.54 → 6968.40] um,
[6968.66 → 6971.58] all created sort of outfits that,
[6971.58 → 6972.50] uh,
[6972.52 → 6975.66] that represented levelling up together, and they went with Pokémon.
[6975.90 → 6976.48] So they had,
[6976.58 → 6980.60] they had scientists, and they had a couple of Pokémon trainers,
[6980.70 → 6982.68] including one on a bicycle complete,
[6982.68 → 6984.38] complete with helmet safety first.
[6984.58 → 6986.04] Thanks Nate for remembering that.
[6986.36 → 6986.72] Um,
[6986.72 → 6988.70] they had some Pokémon in their very,
[6988.72 → 6990.52] various evolutionary stages.
[6990.70 → 6991.84] Luke was tall grass.
[6991.94 → 6992.26] Oh yeah,
[6992.28 → 6992.90] I don't have a good,
[6992.90 → 6994.84] how does tall grass level up Luke?
[6995.16 → 6995.36] Well,
[6995.44 → 6997.28] tall grass is where you go to level up Dan.
[6997.40 → 6997.64] Yeah.
[6997.72 → 7000.98] And there were trainers on the tall grass and there was Pokémon on the hat.
[7000.98 → 7003.36] Dan's just salty because Luke's team beat his.
[7003.50 → 7003.74] Yeah.
[7004.28 → 7004.44] Yeah.
[7004.56 → 7005.66] Way to lose Dan.
[7005.76 → 7006.32] Pretty good.
[7006.38 → 7006.98] Way to lose.
[7006.98 → 7007.50] Good job.
[7008.14 → 7008.54] Anyway,
[7008.54 → 7010.18] as part of levelling up,
[7010.38 → 7018.48] Sammy attempted to level up his finances by opening up a pack of Pokémon cards as part of their presentation of their concept.
[7019.52 → 7019.56] And,
[7019.62 → 7019.94] um,
[7019.94 → 7021.34] instead he levelled up his debt.
[7021.82 → 7022.24] Yeah.
[7022.88 → 7023.50] Which is,
[7023.62 → 7023.72] yeah,
[7023.78 → 7025.46] which he also just said in chat.
[7025.90 → 7026.66] Is a type of,
[7026.72 → 7028.50] is a type of levelling up as well.
[7028.60 → 7028.88] Yeah.
[7029.64 → 7030.12] Um,
[7030.32 → 7032.22] weekend Jedi 42 asks,
[7032.32 → 7033.52] why are there are no pictures of this?
[7033.52 → 7033.80] We,
[7033.96 → 7040.10] we decided many years ago that our Christmas party was mostly going to be a content free zone.
[7040.18 → 7041.30] We do kind of weird stuff.
[7041.86 → 7042.18] Um,
[7042.18 → 7044.40] I wasn't involved in the games planning this year.
[7044.72 → 7045.18] Um,
[7045.20 → 7052.72] but I won't pretend that it was any more weird than some of the stuff that I have planned in the past.
[7052.72 → 7054.50] You had to like dig through,
[7054.50 → 7055.30] uh,
[7055.30 → 7063.50] containers of like mashed potatoes and dry noodles and wet noodles with a wooden spoon in your mouth to find codes to unlock combination locks.
[7063.56 → 7063.88] It was a
[7063.92 → 7064.44] it was a whole thing.
[7064.44 → 7066.18] I don't remember which one of those things,
[7066.22 → 7068.42] but one of those trays like stank.
[7068.42 → 7068.88] Yeah.
[7068.94 → 7070.94] I think it was like Alfredo sauce or something.
[7071.18 → 7071.58] It was rough.
[7072.06 → 7072.72] I look,
[7072.80 → 7075.20] I'm not going to say I would have done any better,
[7075.20 → 7078.70] but I will say that I was not involved in the games this year.
[7078.96 → 7079.44] Yeah.
[7079.80 → 7080.16] Uh,
[7080.16 → 7080.64] anyway,
[7080.64 → 7082.98] the point is that,
[7082.98 → 7083.44] um,
[7084.12 → 7084.36] we,
[7084.44 → 7086.14] we want it to be kind of a
[7086.24 → 7086.54] uh,
[7086.54 → 7086.86] uh,
[7086.86 → 7087.48] uh,
[7087.48 → 7087.90] uh,
[7087.90 → 7088.08] um,
[7088.08 → 7091.10] like social media free zone where people can,
[7091.26 → 7091.58] you know,
[7091.96 → 7093.16] cut loose a little bit for,
[7093.30 → 7094.38] for once around here.
[7094.46 → 7095.80] We really appreciate that.
[7095.86 → 7096.38] We did.
[7096.38 → 7096.98] So nice.
[7096.98 → 7099.52] We have to do one short this year,
[7099.52 → 7104.38] but it is very short, and it just involves the giveaway of the high sense one 16-inch TV.
[7104.52 → 7106.48] So we broke policy for that,
[7106.56 → 7107.20] but yeah,
[7107.20 → 7107.90] spoiler alert,
[7107.90 → 7108.32] exception,
[7108.46 → 7108.96] not the rule.
[7109.22 → 7109.70] Spoiler alert,
[7109.78 → 7110.00] dad.
[7110.12 → 7110.36] Sorry.
[7110.42 → 7111.16] I didn't win it again.
[7112.06 → 7112.74] One time.
[7112.86 → 7113.18] How many,
[7113.24 → 7114.30] how many tickets did you put in?
[7114.60 → 7117.02] I always do over half my stack in the
[7117.08 → 7118.24] in the grand prize.
[7118.34 → 7118.54] Yeah.
[7118.88 → 7119.92] I did most of them.
[7119.92 → 7120.52] Because my,
[7120.64 → 7121.42] I saw,
[7121.58 → 7122.76] I went through them before,
[7122.96 → 7123.82] before I drew.
[7124.04 → 7124.20] Yeah.
[7124.20 → 7124.64] And I was like,
[7124.72 → 7124.96] wow,
[7124.96 → 7126.60] Dan put a lot of tickets in here.
[7126.60 → 7128.18] A bunch of people did.
[7128.32 → 7130.38] I know Alex and James are also trying to get it.
[7130.66 → 7132.40] I actually pulled up my,
[7132.40 → 7133.00] uh,
[7133.00 → 7138.28] like office model just to check because it's like nine feet wide.
[7138.52 → 7138.90] Yeah.
[7138.98 → 7141.04] It wouldn't make any sense for me at all,
[7141.04 → 7141.74] but it would be,
[7141.80 → 7143.08] it would be cool at my dad's place.
[7143.24 → 7143.76] We've been,
[7143.84 → 7146.48] we've been going through every once in a bit.
[7146.56 → 7146.88] We did.
[7146.96 → 7147.10] I,
[7147.20 → 7147.54] I mean,
[7147.54 → 7149.38] we did watch two towers now.
[7150.06 → 7151.44] There's return of the King left.
[7151.44 → 7151.98] And I was,
[7152.04 → 7154.42] I was sitting there next to him at the Christmas party.
[7154.50 → 7155.36] I leaned over, and I'd be like,
[7155.46 → 7155.96] it pretty,
[7156.20 → 7159.98] it'd be pretty sick to watch return of the King on like the enormous TV.
[7160.28 → 7160.92] It would.
[7161.10 → 7161.60] It'll happen.
[7161.86 → 7162.62] It'll happen sometime.
[7162.82 → 7163.02] Hey,
[7163.24 → 7163.54] I,
[7163.74 → 7165.96] you guys will come over to watch hockey games at my place.
[7166.02 → 7166.48] Feel free.
[7166.62 → 7167.08] That's true.
[7167.22 → 7167.40] Yeah.
[7167.40 → 7169.52] You could always watch return of the King on the
[7169.58 → 7172.90] on the slightly smaller 115-inch TV.
[7173.08 → 7173.62] Can't do it.
[7173.88 → 7174.08] You can,
[7174.28 → 7174.36] I mean,
[7174.36 → 7174.96] it's too small.
[7175.06 → 7175.36] Yeah.
[7175.48 → 7176.04] It's too small.
[7176.08 → 7177.08] You'll have to make friends with the
[7177.08 → 7178.08] we're not disclosing who it was.
[7178.26 → 7178.40] Yes.
[7178.64 → 7178.76] Yeah.
[7178.76 → 7180.42] You'll have to make friends with the person who won it.
[7180.42 → 7180.70] Yeah.
[7180.70 → 7180.80] Yeah.
[7180.80 → 7183.18] Then you can watch on the proper biggest TV.
[7183.38 → 7183.40] Yeah.
[7183.40 → 7183.86] There you go.
[7184.68 → 7185.08] Um,
[7185.14 → 7185.76] what else are we,
[7185.84 → 7186.84] what are we supposed to be doing now,
[7186.90 → 7187.12] Dan?
[7188.50 → 7188.82] Uh,
[7188.88 → 7189.92] sponsors one and two.
[7190.32 → 7190.72] Yeah.
[7191.00 → 7194.82] The show is brought to you today by you green during the holiday season.
[7194.98 → 7198.34] We can all find ourselves rushing around.
[7199.30 → 7199.70] Wow.
[7199.82 → 7200.26] That's,
[7201.18 → 7203.28] I cannot skateboard.
[7204.06 → 7204.46] Oh,
[7204.52 → 7204.94] honestly,
[7204.94 → 7207.42] I thought you did a better job than I probably would have.
[7207.64 → 7208.00] Really?
[7208.26 → 7209.24] The fact that you stayed up.
[7209.82 → 7210.02] Oh,
[7210.10 → 7210.32] really?
[7210.42 → 7211.24] Like once you were actually,
[7211.34 → 7211.64] this,
[7212.24 → 7214.38] you stayed up, and I don't know if it was intentional,
[7214.56 → 7215.92] but it looked like you tried to like,
[7215.96 → 7216.26] kind of,
[7216.82 → 7217.14] you know.
[7217.30 → 7219.84] So I didn't use to be able to do that at all,
[7219.94 → 7220.78] but then I,
[7220.78 → 7222.66] I rode the Z board around a lot.
[7223.06 → 7223.88] Oh yeah.
[7224.04 → 7224.40] Okay.
[7224.88 → 7225.90] Like I wasn't,
[7225.98 → 7226.08] I,
[7226.16 → 7226.62] for years,
[7226.62 → 7232.94] I wasn't able to figure out how I can be so competent at snowboarding and so utterly worthless at skateboarding.
[7233.12 → 7233.56] Yeah.
[7233.56 → 7235.54] Turns out they're not related skills.
[7235.70 → 7235.94] No.
[7236.24 → 7236.62] Anyway,
[7236.80 → 7237.70] in the middle of the madness,
[7237.98 → 7243.50] that quick pocket check can turn into a mini heart attack when you realize you don't have your wallet.
[7244.16 → 7245.14] Where could it be?
[7245.94 → 7246.22] Well,
[7246.24 → 7246.92] thanks to you greens,
[7247.36 → 7248.06] fine track,
[7248.24 → 7250.62] slim S you'll never have to wonder again.
[7250.62 → 7257.74] It's a super slim card that slips right into your wallet and works with the Samsung find app to help you locate it instantly.
[7258.08 → 7262.54] The slim S is rechargeable and you green claims that with just a one to two hour charge,
[7262.60 → 7265.16] you can get up to a full year of battery life.
[7265.82 → 7266.84] Finding your wallet is easy.
[7266.84 → 7270.44] Just double press the button on the smart finder and the Samsung device will ring.
[7270.62 → 7275.92] You can even track your wallet globally and the app keeps a history of your wallet's location for up to seven days.
[7276.46 → 7280.08] Grab your you green fine track slim at the link down below.
[7280.30 → 7280.70] Okay.
[7280.70 → 7283.02] You guys watch the WAN show.
[7283.22 → 7283.42] So,
[7283.50 → 7283.92] you know,
[7284.00 → 7285.16] I don't say this very often,
[7285.32 → 7287.22] but I need one of these.
[7288.42 → 7288.78] Um,
[7288.86 → 7289.10] I,
[7289.20 → 7290.80] I don't lose my wallet often.
[7291.14 → 7292.02] When you do it,
[7292.08 → 7292.52] when I do,
[7292.66 → 7292.86] I'm,
[7292.94 → 7293.98] it's like really stressful.
[7294.20 → 7294.38] Yeah.
[7294.80 → 7295.16] Uh,
[7295.16 → 7296.20] and I really don't like it.
[7296.28 → 7297.64] We need one for Linus.
[7298.84 → 7301.56] You have to put two in one for a personal one and one for,
[7301.68 → 7303.08] so we can find it for you.
[7304.74 → 7305.10] No,
[7305.22 → 7306.98] he meant to find me full of tracking.
[7307.16 → 7307.38] Oh,
[7307.48 → 7309.58] he just wants to track where I am.
[7309.58 → 7312.06] It's a concept that we've kicked around a lot.
[7312.38 → 7312.58] Yeah.
[7312.86 → 7315.72] I think we have like a Linus air tag somewhere.
[7316.24 → 7316.64] Yeah.
[7317.74 → 7319.78] The show is also brought to you by Miró.
[7320.36 → 7326.88] Sometimes the process of turning an idea into action or into a product can feel like it takes forever,
[7326.88 → 7329.64] but Miró wants to help you get on track.
[7329.64 → 7332.04] So you won't have to stress as much about hitting a deadline.
[7332.78 → 7336.26] Miró is a collaborative whiteboard designed for teams to brainstorm,
[7336.26 → 7337.24] diagram,
[7337.68 → 7338.06] plan,
[7338.18 → 7339.92] and track projects in real time,
[7340.02 → 7342.10] regardless of where in the world they are.
[7342.56 → 7344.58] While AI can make things messier,
[7344.72 → 7346.16] especially without human intervention,
[7346.70 → 7351.90] Miró's AI sidekicks are designed to work with your team as something more akin to a project manager.
[7352.26 → 7354.48] It can be used to sort through things like sticky notes,
[7354.72 → 7355.12] research,
[7355.44 → 7356.40] concepts for videos,
[7356.40 → 7359.50] and it can combine them into structured project summaries.
[7359.50 → 7364.20] And you can use Miró's prototypes to turn your ideas into interactive tools right on the canvas,
[7364.42 → 7365.64] helping your team save time.
[7366.26 → 7367.38] And while we can't show it on screen,
[7367.56 → 7369.74] we've actually used Miró for our company org chart.
[7370.04 → 7370.38] Oh yeah,
[7370.42 → 7371.48] we're not going to show that on screen.
[7371.74 → 7373.22] So instead there's just,
[7373.30 → 7373.66] I don't know,
[7373.72 → 7374.20] our website.
[7375.06 → 7378.00] So help your teams get great done with Miró.
[7378.14 → 7379.80] Check out Miro.com to find out how.
[7379.90 → 7382.60] That's M-I-R-O dot com.
[7383.86 → 7384.38] All right.
[7384.60 → 7385.42] What are we supposed to be doing,
[7385.52 → 7385.66] Dan?
[7386.00 → 7386.94] Keep us on track.
[7387.68 → 7388.76] Heard some cats.
[7388.76 → 7389.56] Sure,
[7389.64 → 7390.44] we can do topics.
[7394.18 → 7398.50] MKBHD's scam wallpaper app is shutting down.
[7398.68 → 7400.12] And dear God,
[7400.32 → 7400.66] please,
[7400.88 → 7402.88] I am not calling it a scam.
[7403.26 → 7410.08] I'm just recalling when we discussed it back when he launched this product and people were calling it a scam.
[7410.08 → 7417.18] And we had that long conversation about how people are using the word scam to describe things that are not scams.
[7417.18 → 7422.68] The product always did exactly what he said it would do, which means it's not a scam.
[7422.68 → 7425.44] You just don't like it.
[7426.12 → 7427.70] Which is a totally different thing.
[7428.48 → 7428.92] Anyway,
[7430.34 → 7432.20] panels is going away.
[7432.20 → 7439.74] On November 30th, Marques published an unlisted video giving an update on the wallpaper app panels announcing that it is being sunsetted.
[7440.06 → 7446.18] For those who missed it, panels, which was started by the MKBHD team, was launched on September 26th of last year.
[7446.18 → 7454.02] It was an app dedicated to downloading wallpapers for your mobile devices and was immediately met with backlash for a number of reasons,
[7454.02 → 7457.60] with the biggest being the $50 yearly subscription.
[7457.60 → 7461.32] Which, again, I repeat, is not a scam.
[7461.68 → 7468.66] It just is of dubious value to many of the folks who evaluated its value.
[7468.80 → 7471.80] People buy art for very weird amounts of money.
[7472.76 → 7474.46] And sometimes that is a scam.
[7474.82 → 7475.28] Yeah.
[7475.56 → 7478.98] But it's not a scam of the person who's buying the art.
[7479.16 → 7481.00] It's a scam of the tax system.
[7481.32 → 7484.04] So that's a whole separate deal.
[7484.04 → 7484.38] Yeah.
[7485.52 → 7489.76] Marques did make a follow-up video offering a lot more explanation for the pricing,
[7489.86 → 7493.20] including how it would help support the artists that made the images.
[7493.88 → 7497.42] But as of now, the final date for the app is December 31st,
[7497.42 → 7502.06] and Marques explained that there will be a prorated refund for anyone who is currently subscribed.
[7502.66 → 7507.48] And this is super cool, and the main reason that I even wanted to talk about this at all,
[7508.02 → 7511.88] he announced that the entire source code will be going up on GitHub for free
[7511.88 → 7515.48] if you ever wanted to make a wallpaper app.
[7516.06 → 7519.42] And realistically, does anybody need this source code?
[7519.98 → 7520.92] Probably not.
[7521.44 → 7524.74] But as far as good guy moves go,
[7525.08 → 7527.00] if you're going to discontinue something,
[7527.42 → 7528.52] a prorated refund,
[7529.00 → 7535.16] and making the code open source for anyone who wants to continue it in any way,
[7535.32 → 7536.48] making the source code available,
[7536.48 → 7540.70] this is about the most graceful way you can possibly do it,
[7540.88 → 7542.44] and I think that's pretty cool.
[7543.86 → 7544.50] That's it.
[7544.90 → 7546.42] That's all I have to say about that.
[7551.34 → 7551.78] Cool.
[7553.62 → 7554.66] Next one.
[7554.96 → 7555.80] It is cool.
[7556.26 → 7557.96] Dope even, you might say.
[7560.48 → 7561.72] Is it dope tech?
[7562.18 → 7562.48] No.
[7562.76 → 7563.06] Okay.
[7563.46 → 7564.14] Sounds good.
[7564.14 → 7566.04] Did we talk about Cherry yet?
[7566.14 → 7566.74] I don't think so.
[7567.10 → 7567.28] No.
[7567.44 → 7567.82] Rip Cherry.
[7568.20 → 7569.88] Cherry held a patent for mechanical switches
[7569.88 → 7573.24] and used to be the gold standard for keyboards.
[7573.84 → 7574.84] For keyboard switches.
[7575.16 → 7575.44] Yeah.
[7575.92 → 7579.32] That patent may be keyboards if you do, like,
[7579.48 → 7581.62] checkout systems at Vegas for some reason.
[7583.04 → 7584.46] Yeah, McDonald's, like.
[7585.26 → 7585.98] Yeah, yeah.
[7586.10 → 7587.20] Random stuff like that.
[7587.20 → 7589.20] That patent lapsed in 2014.
[7589.58 → 7591.08] Since Cherry's patent lapsed,
[7591.18 → 7593.86] competition has slowly, but surely.
[7593.86 → 7594.54] But quickly.
[7594.64 → 7596.22] Kind of, yeah, pretty quick, actually.
[7596.50 → 7597.38] Pushed them out of business.
[7598.28 → 7599.98] There, yeah, it says it again.
[7600.12 → 7601.58] It lapsed in 2014.
[7601.98 → 7603.44] Tons of other companies sprung up,
[7603.60 → 7606.44] and then I never really know how to say these names properly,
[7606.66 → 7606.78] but.
[7606.92 → 7607.36] Patron.
[7607.62 → 7608.06] Patron.
[7608.16 → 7608.88] I took the easy one.
[7608.88 → 7609.88] Text.
[7610.54 → 7612.50] Wick or JWK, etc.
[7612.78 → 7613.06] Many.
[7613.24 → 7616.58] The new companies have improved over Cherry in the past decade
[7616.58 → 7619.46] in, like, honestly, a wide variety of ways.
[7619.52 → 7619.74] Yep.
[7621.10 → 7622.28] It's been pretty wild.
[7622.56 → 7624.52] Many premium switches now come pre-lubed,
[7624.60 → 7625.94] which is quite a benefit.
[7625.94 → 7626.68] Huge time saver.
[7626.86 → 7627.10] Yeah.
[7627.42 → 7628.60] Like, dude, lubing switches?
[7629.44 → 7632.36] It's like, that's the real reason
[7632.36 → 7635.76] that all these, like, tiny keyboard form factors got popular.
[7636.54 → 7638.86] Everyone just gaslit themselves into believing
[7638.86 → 7640.22] that they wanted a tiny keyboard,
[7640.22 → 7642.08] but what they actually didn't want to do
[7642.08 → 7644.44] was lube 104 stems.
[7645.00 → 7645.32] Oh!
[7646.08 → 7646.48] I'm kidding.
[7646.58 → 7648.76] I know a lot of you legitimately love your tiny keyboards.
[7649.80 → 7650.10] Hot take.
[7650.16 → 7651.04] I think this is one of the reasons
[7651.04 → 7653.90] why keyboard stuff is getting more boring these days, though,
[7653.94 → 7655.48] is there's nothing to it anymore.
[7655.62 → 7656.72] But anyway, moving on.
[7658.90 → 7659.26] Yeah.
[7659.74 → 7661.92] Experimentation with other materials has been a big part of it.
[7662.48 → 7665.26] Cherry just hasn't really been the gold standard for a while,
[7665.34 → 7667.20] and they haven't kept up with things like hall effects
[7667.20 → 7668.52] or optical switches and whatnot.
[7669.14 → 7671.82] Cherry is now looking to give up its German production
[7671.82 → 7673.16] and sell the core division.
[7673.56 → 7674.54] You might be like, wow,
[7674.54 → 7675.56] that seems like an overreaction.
[7675.96 → 7676.36] No!
[7676.78 → 7679.12] From January 2025 to the end of September,
[7679.12 → 7685.32] the company made a net loss of almost 20.4 million euros.
[7687.66 → 7688.30] Whoa!
[7688.96 → 7690.78] I'm kind of surprised that was even possible.
[7691.28 → 7693.58] And something that you've got to kind of understand
[7693.58 → 7698.64] is that Cherry, like, key switch-ness
[7698.64 → 7701.98] is a really, tiny part
[7701.98 → 7704.74] of their parent company's operation.
[7704.94 → 7708.06] It's, like, kind of barely even a footnote.
[7708.30 → 7710.90] So the fact that they even bothered for this long
[7710.90 → 7713.30] is honestly kind of a surprise.
[7713.30 → 7714.52] When we were there,
[7715.18 → 7716.94] which Cherry was, like,
[7717.00 → 7718.62] much more on top of the world at that time.
[7718.74 → 7719.44] Hell yeah.
[7719.96 → 7721.02] What a great shot.
[7721.16 → 7721.36] Yeah.
[7721.86 → 7723.16] But when we were there,
[7723.22 → 7724.36] I remember thinking, like,
[7724.66 → 7726.30] oh, this is, like, pretty small.
[7726.30 → 7726.86] Small.
[7727.32 → 7727.68] Yeah.
[7728.18 → 7730.82] And then we couldn't shoot any of it.
[7731.36 → 7732.64] But actually, hold on.
[7732.68 → 7734.10] I'm just going to check a thing.
[7738.40 → 7738.84] Yeah.
[7738.94 → 7739.42] Okay, cool.
[7739.42 → 7744.34] In 2008, Cherry was purchased by ZF.
[7744.82 → 7747.56] So we couldn't shoot any of it.
[7747.86 → 7750.64] But, like, the stuff that ZF was doing
[7750.64 → 7754.22] for, like, the automotive industry and stuff
[7754.22 → 7756.34] was, like, oh.
[7756.88 → 7760.00] So they just wanted Cherry's IP, probably,
[7760.70 → 7763.00] for something to do with their real business.
[7763.28 → 7764.94] And they were like, sure.
[7765.40 → 7767.64] You keep doing your little thing.
[7767.64 → 7771.14] Apparently, ZF sold the Cherry group
[7771.14 → 7772.58] back in 2016,
[7773.40 → 7775.04] but still uses Cherry branded.
[7775.20 → 7776.24] Okay, this is AI, though.
[7776.38 → 7777.04] So who knows?
[7777.52 → 7778.56] But the point is,
[7778.62 → 7780.04] they did own them at some point,
[7780.38 → 7782.72] and Cherry was later.
[7782.78 → 7783.18] Oh, wow.
[7783.30 → 7784.74] Cherry has been sold a couple of times.
[7785.36 → 7786.40] So timeline of ownership.
[7786.64 → 7788.82] ZF purchased them in 2008.
[7790.26 → 7791.88] ZF sold them in 2016.
[7791.88 → 7794.32] So this is after the patent lapsed.
[7794.32 → 7798.52] And then that was two Genus partners.
[7798.52 → 7801.36] And then from 2020 to 2021,
[7801.36 → 7803.64] it was acquired by Armand Partners.
[7804.78 → 7807.48] Yeah, so things have clearly been
[7807.48 → 7810.52] circling the drain for quite a while now.
[7811.02 → 7811.16] Yeah.
[7811.48 → 7812.00] What do you think?
[7814.16 → 7815.18] You're going to buy Cherry?
[7815.38 → 7815.92] We buy Cherry.
[7816.64 → 7817.74] No, I don't want them.
[7817.98 → 7818.92] Do what with it?
[7819.14 → 7819.66] Exactly.
[7819.66 → 7822.54] I can't really add anything to that table.
[7822.80 → 7824.34] I mean, what they were worth
[7824.34 → 7826.80] was the IP and the German manufacturing.
[7827.28 → 7829.88] And now the IP is worthless
[7829.88 → 7831.80] and the German manufacturing is closing.
[7832.16 → 7832.50] Yeah.
[7832.86 → 7835.14] So, yeah, I think they're just,
[7835.26 → 7836.58] I think they're a relic now.
[7836.68 → 7837.70] Make Canadian switches.
[7838.90 → 7841.86] I mean, would anybody really want maple syrup?
[7842.02 → 7843.66] Maple syrup, lube, yeah.
[7843.76 → 7844.50] I don't think so.
[7845.14 → 7846.16] It would smell really nice.
[7846.62 → 7847.10] Yeah.
[7847.10 → 7847.98] For a little while.
[7847.98 → 7848.50] Yeah.
[7849.00 → 7850.86] It would smell terrible eventually.
[7851.00 → 7851.26] Yeah.
[7853.82 → 7855.06] I mean, there are a lot of things
[7855.06 → 7856.12] that people like that.
[7856.12 → 7856.56] That's a great business model, really.
[7856.96 → 7857.88] Yeah, because then you just have to
[7857.88 → 7858.86] keep buying a new one.
[7861.32 → 7863.12] We finally have a consumable product.
[7863.60 → 7864.46] Yeah, like that'd be,
[7864.62 → 7866.22] oh man, imagine you could make
[7866.22 → 7867.86] like the world's best smelling cologne,
[7868.08 → 7869.54] but it only smells good for an hour.
[7869.88 → 7871.94] You know, like what a business model that would be.
[7871.94 → 7874.18] If it was actually the world's best smelling cologne,
[7874.32 → 7875.06] like objectively,
[7875.26 → 7876.70] that would sell like crazy.
[7876.70 → 7877.90] Oh, people would totally do it.
[7877.98 → 7878.16] Yeah.
[7878.30 → 7880.18] You know who's super into cologne?
[7881.86 → 7882.26] Sherwood.
[7883.06 → 7883.56] That makes sense.
[7883.62 → 7886.92] He gave me like a whole like lesson on cologne
[7886.92 → 7889.36] when we were stuck in an airport for five hours
[7889.36 → 7890.22] on that China trip.
[7890.22 → 7890.64] This lines up for me.
[7891.00 → 7891.34] Oh yeah.
[7891.68 → 7892.28] He's like,
[7892.92 → 7894.62] and it's not just like,
[7895.24 → 7895.50] you know,
[7895.54 → 7895.94] he's like,
[7896.02 → 7896.36] oh yeah,
[7896.46 → 7898.08] here's the one that I have
[7898.08 → 7899.70] and I like it a lot.
[7900.26 → 7902.40] Different ones for different like occasions and stuff.
[7902.40 → 7902.90] Because he,
[7903.02 → 7903.24] cause,
[7903.24 → 7903.82] cause that's,
[7903.82 → 7904.70] the change with the seasons.
[7904.84 → 7905.40] That's just like,
[7905.48 → 7905.66] oh,
[7905.70 → 7907.00] you went on the Subreddit
[7907.00 → 7909.02] and you went to like the pinned one
[7909.02 → 7910.56] and then you just bought whatever was the top one.
[7910.56 → 7910.76] Sure.
[7910.90 → 7911.06] Yeah,
[7911.06 → 7911.22] yeah,
[7911.22 → 7911.40] yeah.
[7911.62 → 7911.82] No,
[7911.88 → 7912.00] no,
[7912.16 → 7912.34] no,
[7912.38 → 7912.46] no,
[7912.46 → 7912.60] no.
[7912.66 → 7913.18] He's like,
[7913.28 → 7914.58] here's the one that like,
[7914.68 → 7916.84] I'd love to wear regularly,
[7916.84 → 7918.34] but it's like not affordable.
[7918.34 → 7919.86] But here's the one that,
[7920.24 → 7920.66] you know,
[7920.72 → 7921.32] because,
[7921.32 → 7922.06] uh,
[7922.12 → 7922.38] you know,
[7922.40 → 7922.54] what,
[7922.54 → 7922.84] what's,
[7922.92 → 7923.66] what's their name?
[7923.86 → 7924.34] Uh,
[7924.90 → 7925.62] not Mac,
[7925.82 → 7927.04] but maybe it was Mac.
[7927.28 → 7933.16] Basically he like knew the promotional cycle of one of our local cosmetics chains and was like,
[7933.20 → 7933.36] yeah,
[7933.44 → 7933.56] so,
[7933.66 → 7936.16] so I'll pick up like the big bottle of this from them,
[7936.16 → 7938.96] like during this month when they like to have the promo,
[7939.12 → 7940.56] but these are really nice.
[7940.80 → 7942.42] And he like shows me a couple.
[7942.50 → 7942.76] He's like,
[7942.80 → 7942.90] yeah,
[7942.90 → 7944.00] they like kind of change over time.
[7944.04 → 7946.32] This one's like fireplace and like,
[7946.32 → 7946.54] okay,
[7946.54 → 7947.08] check this out.
[7947.12 → 7947.26] Okay.
[7947.26 → 7948.00] Smell it right away.
[7948.00 → 7948.36] And I'm like,
[7948.42 → 7948.60] Oh,
[7948.60 → 7948.86] okay.
[7948.94 → 7949.62] And then he is like,
[7949.64 → 7952.68] like he goes like this with the card, and then he actually like carried it with him.
[7952.68 → 7953.82] And then like 10 minutes later,
[7953.82 → 7954.14] he's like,
[7954.20 → 7954.38] okay,
[7954.72 → 7956.16] now smell the fireplace one.
[7956.24 → 7958.54] So he had me like smell like a bunch of these.
[7958.60 → 7958.84] And he's like,
[7958.90 → 7959.10] yeah,
[7959.32 → 7961.18] see how it like smells different now.
[7961.18 → 7963.86] Like it was sweet at the beginning, and now it's more smoky.
[7963.96 → 7964.58] This is like,
[7964.90 → 7965.64] this is like perfect.
[7965.70 → 7967.00] He's like talking to me through all this stuff.
[7967.06 → 7967.36] I'm like,
[7967.44 → 7967.70] dude,
[7968.12 → 7969.52] I don't know.
[7969.58 → 7971.00] I just wear my speed stick.
[7971.36 → 7972.52] I was going to say,
[7972.56 → 7973.80] I'm pretty sure you don't even wear cologne.
[7974.48 → 7975.94] No underarm stuff.
[7975.94 → 7976.30] Yeah.
[7976.50 → 7976.82] No,
[7976.90 → 7977.18] I mean,
[7977.20 → 7978.58] as long as I don't stink.
[7978.68 → 7978.78] Yeah.
[7978.78 → 7979.16] I was going to say,
[7979.20 → 7979.96] you're not on the
[7980.14 → 7981.70] there's like a spectrum, and it's,
[7981.70 → 7985.04] it's stink to doesn't smell bad to smells good.
[7985.16 → 7987.60] And I think we're both getting the doesn't smell bad.
[7987.62 → 7988.08] That's hope.
[7988.20 → 7988.50] Yeah.
[7989.34 → 7990.70] That's the goal at least.
[7991.46 → 7991.90] Yeah.
[7992.00 → 7992.26] I,
[7992.26 → 7992.94] I actually,
[7993.16 → 7993.56] uh,
[7994.36 → 7999.58] it was asked once what I smell like in an AMA.
[8000.06 → 8002.66] And I believe it was because I had some help.
[8002.66 → 8003.14] Oh yeah.
[8003.14 → 8007.06] I had some help responding to the AMA from longtime members of the team.
[8007.30 → 8008.32] And Ed,
[8008.32 → 8009.40] um,
[8009.48 → 8011.10] was the one who responded to that one.
[8011.18 → 8012.66] Thank you very much for that.
[8012.82 → 8013.30] Um,
[8013.30 → 8013.76] and he said,
[8013.80 → 8017.14] I smell like cheap deodorant and cheap hair gel.
[8018.36 → 8021.16] And nowadays, I don't wear hair gel anymore.
[8021.28 → 8022.52] So cheap deodorant,
[8022.62 → 8023.64] just cheap deodorant.
[8023.76 → 8024.02] Nice.
[8024.10 → 8024.56] That works.
[8024.76 → 8025.50] That's good.
[8025.50 → 8027.68] It's perfectly,
[8027.88 → 8029.58] perfectly good guy stuff.
[8030.32 → 8030.80] Um,
[8030.88 → 8032.60] I don't know if I was going to wear anything,
[8032.60 → 8036.78] I would probably just go for the most basic possible.
[8037.48 → 8037.92] Oh,
[8038.20 → 8039.04] not much left.
[8039.38 → 8039.82] Yeah.
[8039.82 → 8042.24] I would probably go for the most basic possible thing.
[8042.28 → 8044.32] And I would just wear like old spice or something.
[8044.32 → 8045.32] Yeah.
[8046.32 → 8046.72] Is it,
[8046.78 → 8046.86] is,
[8046.92 → 8047.24] could you,
[8047.34 → 8047.56] could,
[8047.68 → 8048.02] could,
[8048.24 → 8050.66] would Sherwood be able to like pair something with you?
[8050.92 → 8051.16] I don't know.
[8051.16 → 8052.16] I'm sure he'd be able to,
[8052.26 → 8052.68] but like,
[8052.76 → 8058.20] I honestly think that just like smelling like anything other than just basic would just,
[8058.58 → 8059.56] it wouldn't be right.
[8059.66 → 8060.38] Wouldn't fit your brand.
[8060.74 → 8062.18] It's not even my brand.
[8062.18 → 8063.02] It's just like,
[8063.02 → 8067.50] I wouldn't consistently apply it.
[8067.84 → 8069.58] Like I have to be in,
[8069.88 → 8075.48] I have to be in active pain to consistently use a product in the morning and evening.
[8075.74 → 8076.78] So other than,
[8076.94 → 8077.78] other than,
[8077.78 → 8078.16] uh,
[8078.46 → 8079.62] like teeth brushing,
[8079.82 → 8081.14] you may not believe this.
[8081.72 → 8083.04] It's hard to tell right now.
[8083.04 → 8086.24] Yellow right now because of the wax that's over top of my brackets,
[8086.40 → 8087.24] um,
[8087.28 → 8088.00] which is stained.
[8088.14 → 8088.50] But my,
[8088.50 → 8089.66] my teeth are some,
[8089.76 → 8090.02] I like,
[8090.08 → 8092.12] I care about my oral hygiene.
[8092.26 → 8092.44] I,
[8092.44 → 8094.14] I hate bad breath.
[8094.14 → 8095.78] I like on myself,
[8095.78 → 8096.72] on anyone.
[8096.72 → 8097.06] I'm,
[8097.14 → 8098.34] I don't like bad breath.
[8098.44 → 8100.82] So that's something that I don't have to remember.
[8101.44 → 8101.86] Um,
[8102.06 → 8102.80] but other than that,
[8102.80 → 8105.66] like even my anti-inflammatory cream for the tennis elbow,
[8105.66 → 8110.54] it's taken me so long to heal because I'd be so inconsistent about applying it.
[8110.94 → 8111.42] Like,
[8111.44 → 8113.04] even if I'm actively in pain,
[8113.04 → 8115.38] I will often forget to put on something that I'm,
[8115.50 → 8116.46] that I'm supposed to use.
[8116.72 → 8118.62] Like Yvonne recommended like,
[8118.66 → 8121.38] like facial cleansers and stuff that I'm supposed to use.
[8121.38 → 8121.78] So like,
[8121.78 → 8122.08] I don't know,
[8122.12 → 8124.08] my pores will be smaller or something.
[8124.24 → 8124.44] I'm like,
[8124.48 → 8125.44] who wants small pores?
[8125.52 → 8126.10] Does this matter?
[8126.38 → 8126.58] Like,
[8126.60 → 8126.84] I just,
[8126.94 → 8127.84] I can't be motivated.
[8128.10 → 8128.40] The biggest pores.
[8128.64 → 8130.70] I can't be motivated to use them regularly.
[8130.70 → 8132.56] So I have big,
[8132.68 → 8133.32] strong pores.
[8134.04 → 8134.52] Um,
[8134.52 → 8136.26] Oh man.
[8136.26 → 8137.76] And Salmon asks,
[8138.08 → 8139.28] old spice is basic.
[8139.46 → 8140.50] I ain't fancy.
[8140.60 → 8142.80] I guess old spice is super basic.
[8143.32 → 8143.98] Sherwood would,
[8144.18 → 8146.14] Sherwood would be able to educate you.
[8146.40 → 8146.88] Yeah.
[8147.02 → 8147.84] Old spice is not.
[8148.30 → 8148.60] Yeah.
[8150.52 → 8151.04] Yeah.
[8151.04 → 8152.78] It's literally old.
[8153.72 → 8155.26] It's the old spice.
[8156.52 → 8157.66] And to be clear,
[8157.78 → 8157.86] I,
[8158.00 → 8159.62] they have lots of other products,
[8159.62 → 8160.62] but when I,
[8160.76 → 8162.28] when I was talking about it just now,
[8162.28 → 8164.54] I was referring to literally like the OG,
[8164.80 → 8166.28] like the aftershave smell.
[8166.50 → 8166.94] It's original.
[8167.18 → 8167.36] Yeah.
[8167.72 → 8167.92] Yeah.
[8168.34 → 8168.82] Phil,
[8169.00 → 8171.64] Syphilis says old spices picked up their game lately.
[8171.72 → 8171.98] Okay.
[8172.00 → 8172.52] That's cool.
[8172.98 → 8173.82] Good for them.
[8174.62 → 8176.22] I still think it's Norrie stuff.
[8177.28 → 8178.48] Compared to compared,
[8178.64 → 8179.12] probably.
[8179.44 → 8179.92] Sherwood could never.
[8180.34 → 8180.58] I,
[8180.64 → 8180.82] I,
[8180.82 → 8182.14] I don't think Sherwood would ever.
[8182.52 → 8183.64] I don't think he would ever.
[8183.88 → 8184.78] I'll ask him.
[8185.42 → 8186.16] I'll ask him.
[8186.16 → 8187.56] It's funny looking at like the
[8187.56 → 8189.60] the photos at my parents' house because,
[8189.60 → 8190.32] you know,
[8190.36 → 8192.52] leading up till grade five,
[8192.70 → 8194.32] I don't think you're old enough to possibly care.
[8194.52 → 8196.34] And then in grade five and grade six,
[8196.34 → 8200.06] I cared like a lot about my appearance, and you can tell in the photos.
[8201.32 → 8202.98] And then immediately after that,
[8202.98 → 8203.10] I,
[8203.24 → 8204.46] I never cared again.
[8205.40 → 8207.14] And you can tell in the photos.
[8209.72 → 8211.08] I don't know what happened,
[8211.08 → 8213.56] but,
[8213.64 → 8214.14] uh,
[8214.14 → 8214.64] it's true.
[8216.04 → 8216.54] All right.
[8216.62 → 8216.96] All right.
[8216.96 → 8217.54] I asked him,
[8217.60 → 8218.16] we're going to get,
[8218.28 → 8221.38] we're going to get the experts take probably pretty soon here.
[8221.46 → 8223.04] It's it shows available on,
[8223.20 → 8223.62] on teams.
[8223.78 → 8224.84] So we should hear back from it.
[8224.84 → 8226.28] It's middle of a work day,
[8226.28 → 8227.12] which is weird.
[8227.12 → 8227.80] Cause when show,
[8227.90 → 8228.82] but yeah,
[8229.16 → 8229.42] yeah,
[8229.42 → 8230.00] it should be fine.
[8230.06 → 8230.54] It should be fine.
[8230.64 → 8230.92] This is,
[8231.00 → 8231.62] this is work.
[8231.62 → 8233.10] Yeah.
[8233.22 → 8233.46] The
[8233.46 → 8233.74] the
[8233.74 → 8234.82] when people want to know.
[8234.92 → 8235.26] Yeah.
[8236.28 → 8236.74] All right.
[8236.82 → 8236.94] No,
[8237.00 → 8237.10] no,
[8237.12 → 8237.92] I meant it like,
[8238.54 → 8239.24] yeah,
[8239.26 → 8240.04] I didn't mean it that way.
[8240.10 → 8242.50] I meant like he'll probably be available because three dots.
[8242.62 → 8242.94] Here we go.
[8243.16 → 8243.74] Here we go.
[8243.78 → 8244.46] We've got the dots.
[8244.62 → 8245.80] The dots are incoming.
[8245.80 → 8247.82] I asked him old spice.
[8248.14 → 8248.98] Would you ever,
[8248.98 → 8251.34] I love how it's,
[8251.40 → 8251.48] Oh,
[8251.48 → 8252.44] the three dots are gone.
[8252.72 → 8253.86] Three dots are gone.
[8253.92 → 8257.74] He's thinking like Did.
[8258.28 → 8259.52] Would I ever wear it?
[8259.78 → 8260.08] Lol.
[8262.58 → 8264.34] I mean the brand.
[8265.62 → 8266.18] I can,
[8266.22 → 8266.48] I can,
[8266.56 → 8267.36] I feel like,
[8267.44 → 8267.84] yeah,
[8267.84 → 8270.82] I feel like deodorant versus cologne is like a pretty big jump.
[8270.94 → 8271.44] And that's true.
[8271.92 → 8272.18] Okay.
[8272.26 → 8272.58] So I'm,
[8272.58 → 8274.40] I'm talking more like,
[8274.56 → 8275.50] do they have cologne?
[8275.72 → 8276.28] They must,
[8276.38 → 8276.50] right?
[8276.80 → 8277.46] I don't know.
[8277.84 → 8278.02] Oh,
[8278.06 → 8278.70] maybe we're just,
[8279.02 → 8281.58] maybe we're just asking entirely the wrong question.
[8281.78 → 8281.88] Yeah,
[8281.90 → 8282.64] we might be.
[8284.32 → 8284.76] Uh,
[8284.98 → 8285.60] they have cologne.
[8286.06 → 8286.42] Okay.
[8288.30 → 8289.64] Xerox LT asks,
[8289.76 → 8289.92] wait,
[8290.00 → 8291.28] are there deodorant without a scent?
[8291.44 → 8292.36] I believe so.
[8292.46 → 8294.14] They're really hard to track down though.
[8297.28 → 8297.72] Yeah,
[8297.74 → 8298.24] here we go.
[8298.82 → 8299.54] He sees it.
[8299.72 → 8300.62] He's seen it.
[8300.62 → 8303.14] He's given it a think.
[8303.46 → 8304.34] He's given it a think.
[8304.78 → 8304.98] Uh,
[8304.98 → 8305.82] should we do,
[8306.04 → 8306.18] uh,
[8306.18 → 8307.46] should we do another topic in the meantime?
[8308.12 → 8308.34] Oh,
[8308.42 → 8308.64] sure.
[8308.92 → 8309.24] Oh no.
[8309.32 → 8309.84] Oh dude.
[8309.96 → 8310.52] Oh dude.
[8310.56 → 8312.06] We got a strong response.
[8312.80 → 8313.62] Hell nah.
[8313.74 → 8314.04] Lol.
[8314.14 → 8315.50] I left that in high school.
[8316.24 → 8316.64] Okay.
[8316.76 → 8317.64] So there you go,
[8317.70 → 8318.06] boys.
[8318.62 → 8320.32] We got you your answer.
[8320.60 → 8321.00] Yeah.
[8323.10 → 8324.84] Come DES garçons cologne.
[8325.28 → 8325.68] Thanks.
[8325.84 → 8326.12] I,
[8326.20 → 8326.60] uh,
[8327.02 → 8327.32] thanks.
[8327.42 → 8328.70] I'll let the wind show.
[8328.70 → 8329.50] Come DES garçons.
[8329.50 → 8330.26] Yeah.
[8330.46 → 8331.22] I want to bring it up.
[8331.92 → 8332.04] No,
[8332.10 → 8332.22] no,
[8332.30 → 8333.58] come like,
[8333.78 → 8334.82] like in French.
[8335.22 → 8336.28] Oh my God.
[8336.62 → 8337.06] Stop.
[8338.98 → 8340.94] I will look it up because I can,
[8341.04 → 8343.04] I think I might've found it pretty quick.
[8343.96 → 8344.40] Uh,
[8344.50 → 8344.66] Oh,
[8344.66 → 8346.18] this sounds like a store, maybe.
[8347.86 → 8348.26] Oh,
[8348.38 → 8348.88] come on.
[8349.10 → 8349.26] Okay.
[8349.26 → 8349.68] Here we go.
[8349.76 → 8350.26] Here we go.
[8351.16 → 8352.54] Come DES garçons perfumes.
[8353.26 → 8353.62] Okay.
[8353.72 → 8354.66] So this is,
[8354.76 → 8355.50] this is apparently.
[8355.50 → 8356.94] This is Sherwood approved.
[8357.10 → 8357.32] Yeah.
[8357.66 → 8357.98] And,
[8358.06 → 8358.26] and,
[8358.26 → 8361.72] and they're like packaging is a major factor, apparently.
[8362.36 → 8362.80] Okay.
[8362.88 → 8363.16] I,
[8363.36 → 8367.82] this is not something that I personally can really like to understand too much,
[8367.82 → 8368.80] but,
[8368.88 → 8369.34] um,
[8370.02 → 8371.30] you know,
[8371.38 → 8372.46] apparently that's,
[8372.52 → 8372.72] you know,
[8372.72 → 8373.86] a big part of the
[8374.08 → 8374.56] yeah,
[8374.60 → 8375.24] concrete.
[8375.46 → 8375.86] Dude,
[8375.92 → 8376.48] I don't know.
[8376.60 → 8377.78] This is not my world.
[8377.88 → 8378.82] This is not my world.
[8378.94 → 8382.30] This is not a thing that I really understand very well.
[8383.44 → 8383.80] Neat.
[8384.20 → 8385.64] But this is something that,
[8385.76 → 8385.90] I mean,
[8385.92 → 8386.86] how much does this stuff cost?
[8386.92 → 8387.02] Okay.
[8387.04 → 8387.64] What's the drowning?
[8387.64 → 8389.74] How much does it cost to smell like concrete?
[8391.26 → 8391.70] You know,
[8391.72 → 8391.90] sure.
[8391.94 → 8392.64] Let's find that out.
[8392.70 → 8393.34] I want to know.
[8394.34 → 8395.64] I want to smell like concrete.
[8396.90 → 8397.22] Okay.
[8397.36 → 8397.50] Well,
[8397.56 → 8397.74] I'll be,
[8397.84 → 8398.46] Oh my God.
[8398.88 → 8400.84] These are the only places we can get it.
[8401.56 → 8402.44] What am I even,
[8402.60 → 8403.62] what am I even talking about?
[8403.66 → 8403.78] Sure.
[8403.80 → 8404.56] I'll take your cookies.
[8404.56 → 8407.24] Uh,
[8407.32 → 8407.52] okay.
[8407.54 → 8408.22] Let's go with New York.
[8408.26 → 8409.46] Because that'll likely be in us.
[8409.64 → 8410.04] Oh,
[8411.12 → 8414.08] okay.
[8414.18 → 8415.16] That's not concrete though.
[8415.32 → 8416.30] Is that a year supply?
[8417.62 → 8418.02] First,
[8418.26 → 8419.58] when 30 years ago,
[8419.66 → 8421.72] these perfumes were first imagined,
[8422.08 → 8428.42] expressing the values of the brand through a new medium to disturb the
[8428.42 → 8430.76] traditional parameters of the fragrance industry.
[8431.92 → 8432.36] Yeah.
[8433.22 → 8433.70] Okay.
[8433.70 → 8437.76] that is a job that AI could do.
[8438.22 → 8439.74] Writing the product descriptions for,
[8439.86 → 8441.32] for like bogie,
[8441.32 → 8441.98] um,
[8442.18 → 8443.52] I think so.
[8444.10 → 8444.74] I think so.
[8444.76 → 8446.98] I don't even think anyone's going to be that mad about it.
[8448.46 → 8449.64] Me saying that I don't think,
[8449.68 → 8450.90] I don't even think that's a hot take.
[8451.34 → 8452.14] Someone will be.
[8453.82 → 8454.86] All right.
[8454.88 → 8455.66] Do we move on?
[8456.80 → 8457.16] Uh,
[8457.20 → 8457.60] yeah.
[8457.78 → 8458.04] Yeah.
[8458.04 → 8458.86] I think we move on.
[8458.86 → 8462.38] There are a bunch of no notes topics.
[8462.70 → 8462.84] Yeah.
[8462.88 → 8463.98] We could do a no notes' topic.
[8464.10 → 8464.24] Sure.
[8464.58 → 8469.96] Google has removed the call home and PA style broadcast features from the home
[8469.96 → 8470.22] app.
[8470.30 → 8470.40] Yeah,
[8470.40 → 8470.82] that sucks.
[8471.90 → 8472.38] Yeah.
[8472.74 → 8473.02] Yeah.
[8473.02 → 8479.00] A company is using AI Linus to advertise a pirate streaming box on TikTok.
[8479.10 → 8479.54] That sucks.
[8479.62 → 8479.96] That's lame.
[8481.16 → 8481.56] Yeah.
[8481.72 → 8482.02] Oh,
[8482.14 → 8482.34] here,
[8482.48 → 8482.86] you know what?
[8482.86 → 8483.80] Do you do anything about that?
[8484.00 → 8484.96] Are you going to do anything about that?
[8485.76 → 8486.16] Realistically,
[8486.56 → 8487.10] um,
[8487.10 → 8488.34] you know,
[8488.52 → 8489.74] they know what they're doing.
[8490.00 → 8490.40] Oh yeah.
[8490.44 → 8490.92] That's not you.
[8491.08 → 8491.96] They're in a
[8491.96 → 8496.34] they're in a region where probably like if,
[8496.34 → 8496.60] if,
[8496.60 → 8499.94] if there was a way to go after these guys legally,
[8499.94 → 8506.06] I'm sure that the content owners of the content that they're pirating on the
[8506.06 → 8508.88] you free box us too.
[8509.24 → 8509.72] Uh,
[8509.72 → 8510.86] I'm sure they'd be trying.
[8511.20 → 8514.04] So I'm kind of looking at it going,
[8514.46 → 8516.98] what chance do I have of combating this?
[8517.80 → 8518.28] Um,
[8519.46 → 8519.66] yeah,
[8519.68 → 8524.08] this blows never buy from these guys because they're clearly scummy buttheads.
[8524.12 → 8526.58] And also my mouth is not that big.
[8526.74 → 8527.08] Yeah.
[8527.08 → 8529.00] That's the main thing that made it obvious.
[8529.00 → 8529.94] It wasn't you to be honest.
[8530.40 → 8531.64] I guess I could,
[8531.78 → 8533.16] I can,
[8533.56 → 8533.94] no,
[8534.98 → 8537.00] no.
[8538.26 → 8538.70] Yeah.
[8538.98 → 8541.06] Cause now it's not that wide around.
[8541.20 → 8541.40] Yeah.
[8541.68 → 8542.12] Yeah.
[8543.14 → 8543.58] Yeah.
[8543.76 → 8544.00] Yeah.
[8544.00 → 8544.82] You can't do it that way.
[8545.24 → 8546.32] I can try.
[8546.32 → 8546.94] Not quite.
[8547.14 → 8547.54] No,
[8547.58 → 8548.36] I can't quite get that.
[8548.54 → 8549.52] Sounds horrible when you do that too.
[8550.26 → 8550.66] Listen.
[8551.68 → 8551.94] Okay.
[8551.94 → 8552.46] Don't listen.
[8554.56 → 8555.16] What else?
[8555.54 → 8556.14] Moving on.
[8556.20 → 8556.72] No notes.
[8556.88 → 8562.42] Missouri residents searches for VPNs have quadrupled after age verification laws kicked in.
[8562.50 → 8562.68] Yeah.
[8562.68 → 8563.80] Which we all knew was going to happen.
[8563.84 → 8564.00] Yeah.
[8564.06 → 8564.54] This is,
[8564.74 → 8565.18] this is,
[8565.30 → 8566.46] this is going to be a thing.
[8566.60 → 8566.76] Uh,
[8566.76 → 8569.54] now's a perfect time to shout out our VPN partner,
[8569.72 → 8570.72] private internet access.
[8570.72 → 8573.12] We'll have them linked down below.
[8573.78 → 8574.26] Um,
[8574.30 → 8579.50] our discussion question is how could stories like this getting attention put VPNs at risk?
[8579.50 → 8579.98] Like,
[8580.08 → 8580.60] man,
[8580.82 → 8581.38] ah,
[8582.10 → 8590.52] I would like to think that the U S would stop short of outlawing VPNs because that would
[8590.52 → 8591.32] be like some,
[8591.40 → 8594.66] that would be like some China level authoritarianism.
[8594.66 → 8598.20] Didn't they very recently like pump VPNs like crazy?
[8599.30 → 8599.70] Oh,
[8599.70 → 8600.54] they like told people.
[8600.76 → 8604.02] I think it was like the FBI specifically talked about them or something.
[8604.02 → 8606.56] Like it was one agency that talked about them,
[8606.56 → 8607.34] but the
[8607.34 → 8607.62] the
[8607.62 → 8609.48] the thing to wait,
[8610.24 → 8612.28] shut up.
[8613.66 → 8615.76] Someone said they're illegal in Michigan.
[8616.38 → 8617.78] That can't be right.
[8618.28 → 8619.50] Hold on a second.
[8619.68 → 8620.16] Look that up.
[8620.24 → 8621.32] Hold on a second.
[8621.64 → 8622.12] Yeah.
[8623.62 → 8624.14] Michigan.
[8624.66 → 8626.10] Hold on a second.
[8627.62 → 8627.78] Okay.
[8627.84 → 8628.70] AI says,
[8628.76 → 8629.16] no,
[8629.52 → 8631.18] they are not currently illegal in Michigan,
[8631.18 → 8635.52] but a proposed bill house bill 49 38,
[8636.14 → 8639.46] the anti-corruption of public morals act.
[8639.58 → 8640.78] Oh my God.
[8641.22 → 8647.08] Aimed to ban the sale promotion and use of circumvention tools like VPNs to access
[8647.08 → 8648.66] prohibited content like adult sites,
[8648.78 → 8653.34] forcing ISPs to block them and potentially making tools for remote work illegal.
[8653.34 → 8654.50] Though it is though.
[8654.50 → 8657.44] It's passage and enforceability are uncertain.
[8657.94 → 8659.82] That is an AI summary.
[8663.12 → 8667.42] Electronic frontier foundation has a great headline on this.
[8668.06 → 8672.32] Lawmakers want to ban VPNs, and they have no idea what they're doing.
[8672.32 → 8673.78] Yes.
[8673.96 → 8674.12] Yeah.
[8674.12 → 8674.92] When do they though?
[8675.72 → 8676.08] Yeah.
[8676.28 → 8677.90] When doing practically anything.
[8678.02 → 8683.10] Two truer clauses have never been attached to each other before by an M dash.
[8685.68 → 8686.16] Outstanding.
[8687.28 → 8688.72] Apparently this is Wisconsin,
[8689.06 → 8690.46] Michigan and beyond.
[8690.46 → 8690.76] Wow.
[8690.86 → 8691.70] Buzz Light-year too.
[8691.94 → 8692.42] Oh,
[8692.72 → 8693.00] Oh,
[8693.00 → 8693.42] okay.
[8693.42 → 8694.70] This is over in the UK.
[8695.78 → 8697.00] Oh man.
[8700.64 → 8702.62] Sometimes I feel like,
[8702.62 → 8704.46] you know,
[8704.46 → 8705.58] just add those to the doc.
[8705.70 → 8708.42] My North American cousins.
[8709.48 → 8710.40] I'll highlight it.
[8710.98 → 8714.54] My North American cousins down in the United States of a
[8714.54 → 8715.76] um,
[8716.24 → 8724.64] sometimes I feel like there are certain hot button issues that they get really like raw,
[8724.64 → 8724.88] raw,
[8724.98 → 8725.14] raw,
[8725.14 → 8736.50] my personal freedoms about while completely missing the active erosion of said freedoms in much more restrictive,
[8736.50 → 8739.38] much wider reaching ways that,
[8739.50 → 8739.84] um,
[8739.84 → 8743.44] I just find a little bit baffling.
[8745.74 → 8746.54] I just,
[8746.60 → 8747.34] I find it,
[8747.64 → 8749.66] I find it very confusing,
[8749.66 → 8750.98] um,
[8750.98 → 8755.52] that there isn't more outrage over stuff like this or those,
[8755.74 → 8755.78] uh,
[8755.78 → 8758.08] what was that camera surveillance company?
[8758.08 → 8760.20] They are that surveillance company.
[8760.20 → 8760.50] Yeah.
[8760.60 → 8760.96] Flock,
[8761.06 → 8763.40] the flock camera topic from last week.
[8763.76 → 8767.16] Like this is bad.
[8767.16 → 8770.68] And like anyone,
[8771.26 → 8775.76] any individual Senator or representative or,
[8775.76 → 8776.70] uh,
[8776.74 → 8778.60] governor or whatever,
[8778.60 → 8780.30] or any party that is,
[8780.40 → 8781.68] that is pushing this agenda.
[8783.34 → 8784.34] Like I,
[8784.34 → 8784.96] I,
[8784.96 → 8785.12] I,
[8785.12 → 8785.46] I,
[8785.46 → 8785.76] I,
[8785.76 → 8789.30] I would have a hard time supporting them.
[8790.38 → 8790.96] Um,
[8791.30 → 8795.84] Oh,
[8795.84 → 8797.48] yeah,
[8797.56 → 8798.02] this is,
[8798.12 → 8798.84] this is tough.
[8799.08 → 8799.88] I have a feeling,
[8800.00 → 8800.20] honestly,
[8800.26 → 8801.50] they just don't even know what it is.
[8803.26 → 8803.86] I mean,
[8803.92 → 8805.20] that's what I'm kind of leaning on.
[8805.46 → 8806.24] Cause it actually,
[8806.30 → 8810.80] it actually feels like it supports like traditional American values,
[8811.08 → 8811.74] VPNs.
[8812.14 → 8812.56] Well,
[8812.62 → 8812.86] yeah,
[8812.94 → 8815.54] it's like protecting of the individual from the state,
[8815.78 → 8815.86] blah,
[8815.88 → 8815.96] blah,
[8815.96 → 8816.08] blah,
[8816.14 → 8816.20] blah,
[8816.20 → 8816.54] blah.
[8816.62 → 8817.04] And like,
[8817.04 → 8817.32] so I,
[8817.50 → 8817.98] privacy.
[8818.32 → 8819.26] I really think stuff.
[8819.48 → 8820.60] They just don't even know what it is.
[8821.30 → 8823.36] I suspect it's an education problem.
[8823.36 → 8830.26] All right.
[8832.18 → 8833.52] I don't mean traditional education.
[8833.52 → 8835.46] I don't think you go to school to learn what a VPN is.
[8835.58 → 8835.70] All right.
[8835.72 → 8835.82] All right.
[8835.82 → 8836.68] That's not my point.
[8837.94 → 8838.76] No comment.
[8839.68 → 8840.48] No comment.
[8840.56 → 8841.80] I majored in PIA.
[8842.36 → 8842.76] Yeah.
[8842.76 → 8843.04] Like,
[8843.16 → 8843.38] uh,
[8843.38 → 8844.30] yeah.
[8845.44 → 8845.92] I mean,
[8845.92 → 8847.46] I'm not educated on colognes.
[8847.80 → 8848.28] Uh,
[8848.28 → 8848.86] I'm pissed.
[8848.94 → 8850.20] I didn't learn about that in school.
[8850.20 → 8851.20] Uh,
[8852.04 → 8852.40] anyway,
[8852.80 → 8853.32] next one.
[8854.28 → 8855.24] This one's a little fun.
[8856.64 → 8857.04] Um,
[8857.32 → 8857.68] yeah,
[8857.74 → 8858.02] sure.
[8858.06 → 8858.44] Hit me.
[8859.00 → 8859.44] Uh,
[8859.44 → 8859.94] no notes,
[8860.12 → 8861.00] but there are some,
[8861.06 → 8861.30] I guess,
[8861.44 → 8861.76] uh,
[8861.82 → 8862.32] discussion,
[8862.72 → 8862.96] uh,
[8862.96 → 8866.88] discuss the impact of crawler bots on overall internet traffic using labs as an example.
[8867.00 → 8868.42] There are some discussion questions here.
[8869.02 → 8869.42] Uh,
[8869.54 → 8871.70] what more can be done to regulate crawler bots?
[8872.06 → 8872.34] Uh,
[8872.58 → 8874.06] there are some technical solutions.
[8874.06 → 8874.62] Why don't we show,
[8874.70 → 8876.84] why don't we show the graph that you shared with me first?
[8877.04 → 8877.18] Sure.
[8877.26 → 8878.38] So there's a few now,
[8878.38 → 8879.10] uh,
[8879.10 → 8881.28] because we figured out that you wanted to show this on land.
[8881.36 → 8882.50] So we added some info,
[8882.66 → 8883.82] but there's the linked one.
[8883.90 → 8886.72] So the linked reference image is the one that you initially saw.
[8886.82 → 8887.08] Okay.
[8887.12 → 8887.40] So here,
[8887.46 → 8887.64] let me,
[8887.70 → 8888.46] let me fire that up.
[8888.48 → 8888.64] Okay.
[8888.64 → 8890.38] So here's what Luke showed me.
[8890.38 → 8890.98] And I was like,
[8891.08 → 8891.36] Hey,
[8892.04 → 8894.48] wouldn't it be kind of cool if we talked about this?
[8894.52 → 8897.40] So this is traffic to LTT,
[8897.78 → 8898.22] um,
[8898.28 → 8899.30] to LTT labs.
[8899.52 → 8899.78] Yeah.
[8900.06 → 8902.74] That is non-human,
[8902.74 → 8904.08] um,
[8904.08 → 8910.30] that we were able to trace back to particular AI crawler bots.
[8910.34 → 8912.50] This is a relatively short period of time.
[8912.60 → 8913.26] We're showing like,
[8913.26 → 8914.42] um,
[8914.60 → 8919.04] early November 26th to late midday,
[8919.40 → 8920.42] December 2nd.
[8920.48 → 8920.80] Sorry.
[8920.92 → 8921.16] Sorry.
[8921.26 → 8922.56] I'm doing a bad job.
[8922.56 → 8925.00] I'm doing a bad job of this there.
[8925.10 → 8926.24] November 26th down there.
[8926.26 → 8927.58] I was trying to show the date clearer,
[8927.70 → 8928.10] but whatever.
[8928.20 → 8930.16] I'm just going to circle it and say it's over 20.
[8930.22 → 8931.42] So it's relatively short period of time,
[8931.46 → 8934.56] but you can see like ChatGPT is like an enormous amount of this.
[8934.68 → 8936.18] And then you've got Googlebot,
[8936.26 → 8936.90] Google bots,
[8936.96 → 8937.90] a little bit complicated.
[8937.90 → 8939.10] We'll talk about in a second.
[8939.10 → 8941.40] And then you take a significant jump down.
[8941.40 → 8942.16] Uh,
[8942.16 → 8942.76] so it's significant,
[8942.76 → 8943.62] ChatGPT,
[8943.72 → 8944.56] significant jump down,
[8944.64 → 8945.12] Googlebot,
[8945.34 → 8946.30] significant jump down,
[8946.30 → 8947.52] everything else.
[8947.52 → 8949.18] Basically being duck,
[8949.26 → 8949.56] duck,
[8949.72 → 8950.30] uh,
[8950.30 → 8950.66] Amazon,
[8950.66 → 8952.26] and then the rest.
[8952.82 → 8953.30] Um,
[8953.40 → 8953.82] but yeah,
[8953.82 → 8954.04] it's,
[8954.08 → 8954.38] it's,
[8954.46 → 8955.90] it's a lot.
[8956.16 → 8956.46] Uh,
[8956.46 → 8958.06] but there's other stuff going on too.
[8958.12 → 8958.64] So I'm going to,
[8958.68 → 8960.94] I'm going to need some of my notes here to explain some of this.
[8961.26 → 8965.90] My first discussion question was because these AI bots,
[8965.90 → 8966.32] and we,
[8966.40 → 8966.64] we've,
[8966.70 → 8968.58] we've talked about this with the house fresh folks,
[8968.58 → 8971.74] because these AI bots are completely,
[8972.16 → 8972.86] or no,
[8972.92 → 8973.60] it wasn't house fresh.
[8973.68 → 8974.00] It was,
[8974.00 → 8974.22] uh,
[8974.22 → 8975.82] the Nanotech shutdown topic.
[8976.30 → 8976.86] Um,
[8976.86 → 8977.40] so I was,
[8977.46 → 8986.08] I was chatting with Ryan, and he was saying like a significant amount of their hosting cost is just serving to scrapers.
[8986.58 → 8987.18] Um,
[8987.70 → 8990.84] since they're so undiscerning in their scraping,
[8990.84 → 8991.74] like,
[8991.82 → 8993.40] and we know that the
[8993.40 → 8998.40] the majority of internet users visit just a handful of sites.
[8998.94 → 9006.20] How much internet traffic do you think is just mindless bots,
[9006.30 → 9011.78] scraping sites that very few humans are actually interacting with?
[9011.78 → 9012.04] Like,
[9012.14 → 9012.98] what is the
[9013.06 → 9013.60] what is the
[9013.92 → 9014.58] what is the
[9014.58 → 9016.64] the cost of all of this?
[9017.08 → 9017.42] That's,
[9017.48 → 9017.62] yeah,
[9017.62 → 9018.18] it's quite high.
[9018.34 → 9018.74] It's,
[9018.74 → 9020.60] it's interesting because like there,
[9020.64 → 9022.42] there is also a different line in my opinion,
[9022.42 → 9025.38] because there's scraping in order to build a database or whatever,
[9025.38 → 9028.46] but then there's also scraping on behalf of a user.
[9029.02 → 9032.38] There's no way to differentiate that on the host side.
[9032.82 → 9033.22] Uh,
[9033.22 → 9034.04] but you might have,
[9034.30 → 9035.90] you might tell a bot like,
[9036.00 → 9036.24] oh,
[9036.66 → 9037.56] you said a bunch of stuff,
[9037.62 → 9038.68] but I need links for it.
[9038.68 → 9042.18] And then it's going to go out and like search the internet and find things.
[9042.70 → 9043.10] Um,
[9043.36 → 9045.30] but yeah,
[9045.30 → 9047.58] there's no way for us to tell what the difference is.
[9047.64 → 9051.66] One of the fascinating ones that we've got barely lingual and float plane chat says,
[9051.76 → 9052.82] I work at Wikimedia.
[9053.22 → 9054.34] It's a lot.
[9054.58 → 9054.78] Yeah,
[9054.80 → 9055.00] it's,
[9055.04 → 9055.46] it's a ton.
[9055.66 → 9055.92] Okay.
[9056.04 → 9056.26] Anyway,
[9056.32 → 9056.54] sorry,
[9056.58 → 9056.84] go ahead.
[9056.84 → 9057.32] Um,
[9057.64 → 9060.24] one of the interesting ones we have is this one.
[9060.88 → 9061.62] There we go.
[9061.76 → 9062.44] This chart,
[9062.52 → 9064.86] the blue versus purple lines squiggles.
[9065.18 → 9065.58] Um,
[9065.62 → 9068.58] I couldn't really get a good photo of this explaining what it all is,
[9068.58 → 9069.90] but absorb that for a second.
[9069.96 → 9073.32] Look at the dates when the blue and the purple line diverge.
[9073.38 → 9073.64] Yes.
[9073.70 → 9074.68] Sometime in April,
[9075.58 → 9075.94] March.
[9076.48 → 9076.70] Oh,
[9076.80 → 9077.40] late March.
[9077.58 → 9078.02] Um,
[9078.06 → 9079.32] so the purple,
[9079.76 → 9080.04] uh,
[9080.04 → 9080.26] the
[9080.32 → 9081.68] the purple is impressions.
[9082.08 → 9083.40] The blue is clicks.
[9083.86 → 9084.30] Right,
[9084.34 → 9084.50] right,
[9084.50 → 9084.78] right,
[9084.78 → 9085.06] right,
[9085.06 → 9085.24] right,
[9085.24 → 9085.34] right.
[9085.42 → 9085.82] Uh,
[9085.82 → 9086.12] March,
[9086.22 → 9086.36] 20,
[9086.42 → 9086.74] 25,
[9086.84 → 9089.94] was when AI is all AI results started rolling out in search.
[9090.46 → 9091.02] Oh yeah.
[9091.04 → 9091.18] Yeah.
[9091.18 → 9092.56] We've kind of talked about this before.
[9092.68 → 9094.18] I've had people say that,
[9094.18 → 9094.54] Oh,
[9094.64 → 9096.54] the stuff you're quoting is like,
[9096.60 → 9099.50] not necessarily real.
[9099.50 → 9102.40] Because it's just like your idea of what might be happening.
[9102.40 → 9103.14] So I don't know,
[9103.20 → 9104.84] maybe this will help people accept that.
[9104.84 → 9105.10] Like,
[9105.14 → 9105.30] yeah,
[9105.30 → 9106.74] I know that's for sure happening.
[9107.46 → 9107.90] Um,
[9108.28 → 9109.90] so we're getting brought up more,
[9109.90 → 9112.14] but clicks are,
[9112.14 → 9112.70] are,
[9113.08 → 9113.50] you know,
[9113.58 → 9114.06] the
[9114.06 → 9115.44] the big spikes are lower.
[9115.60 → 9116.64] You can tell there was like,
[9116.64 → 9118.90] a massive spike in purple right around here.
[9119.36 → 9119.84] Uh,
[9119.84 → 9121.46] I don't know necessarily what happened,
[9121.58 → 9125.64] but whatever was interesting and searchable didn't result in clicks.
[9125.66 → 9126.64] And this is LTT labs.
[9126.80 → 9127.00] Yeah.
[9128.18 → 9128.58] Huh.
[9129.02 → 9131.12] Something here happened that was huge.
[9131.16 → 9132.48] It got a little bit of a spike.
[9132.70 → 9132.92] Yeah.
[9132.98 → 9135.34] It was probably one of these bigger ones before,
[9135.34 → 9137.10] but it was not as,
[9137.16 → 9137.98] not as clickable.
[9138.10 → 9139.22] Same thing happens here.
[9139.36 → 9139.60] Wow.
[9139.60 → 9141.54] And then this one was like really massive.
[9142.18 → 9143.68] I'm not entirely sure what this is.
[9143.72 → 9144.66] We could dive into it,
[9144.70 → 9146.94] but I don't know of top of my head what,
[9147.10 → 9148.24] what that fully is.
[9148.50 → 9148.98] Uh,
[9148.98 → 9150.26] and then the last one,
[9150.26 → 9151.30] Oh no,
[9151.44 → 9151.74] never mind.
[9151.78 → 9152.30] There's two more.
[9152.30 → 9153.54] Um,
[9153.62 → 9155.00] Oh yeah,
[9155.00 → 9156.22] this one's kind of interesting.
[9157.46 → 9157.86] Uh,
[9158.26 → 9161.64] the Google one is skewed because,
[9161.64 → 9163.06] uh,
[9163.06 → 9168.60] just Google in general is a little weird because how do you count Google's stuff?
[9168.72 → 9168.90] Yeah.
[9168.98 → 9170.36] Because they are search.
[9170.62 → 9170.92] Yeah.
[9171.02 → 9173.00] So the other ones are kind of more interesting,
[9173.00 → 9178.08] like perplexity over 15,000 requests with 23 total referrals.
[9178.48 → 9178.58] Right.
[9178.58 → 9179.22] Um,
[9179.30 → 9183.88] like there's no way that you can profitably just even web host at that kind of ratio.
[9184.20 → 9184.68] It's,
[9184.74 → 9185.56] it's pretty awesome.
[9186.38 → 9187.50] It's pretty cool.
[9187.78 → 9188.80] And to be clear,
[9188.92 → 9189.18] like,
[9189.24 → 9189.64] okay,
[9190.76 → 9193.76] calm down when I'm talking profitability.
[9194.28 → 9197.72] I'm not going like corporate fat cat profitability here.
[9197.78 → 9199.92] I'm talking more like sustainability.
[9200.40 → 9203.10] It's the death and consolidation of small websites.
[9204.14 → 9204.54] Um,
[9205.08 → 9205.24] okay.
[9205.26 → 9206.04] Back to Luke laptop.
[9206.32 → 9206.82] The last one.
[9206.86 → 9206.96] Yeah.
[9206.98 → 9207.96] Just some top referrals.
[9207.96 → 9208.30] I think,
[9208.36 → 9208.84] I think this,
[9209.04 → 9209.92] this previous one,
[9209.98 → 9210.44] uh,
[9210.44 → 9211.02] is more interesting,
[9211.14 → 9212.40] but just showing this one as well.
[9213.10 → 9213.58] Um,
[9213.80 → 9213.98] duck,
[9214.02 → 9214.16] duck,
[9214.20 → 9215.10] go based duck,
[9215.14 → 9215.26] duck,
[9215.30 → 9219.28] go getting a lot more than Bing was surprising and interesting to me.
[9219.80 → 9220.56] I mean,
[9220.56 → 9222.88] yeah,
[9223.02 → 9224.06] for our audience,
[9224.16 → 9225.66] that does kind of make sense.
[9225.68 → 9225.98] It does.
[9226.28 → 9227.10] Firefox users,
[9227.22 → 9227.50] you know?
[9227.66 → 9227.92] Yeah.
[9228.42 → 9228.90] Um,
[9228.90 → 9229.40] by the way,
[9229.46 → 9229.78] Matt,
[9230.06 → 9230.44] uh,
[9230.44 → 9232.12] from the labs web team says,
[9232.20 → 9232.82] by the way,
[9232.94 → 9237.66] we do use all the anti AI meta tags and best practices to tell them not to scrape.
[9237.66 → 9239.60] They just completely ignore them.
[9239.60 → 9239.98] Yeah.
[9240.02 → 9241.86] Which we absolutely knew was going to be a thing.
[9242.08 → 9242.36] Yeah.
[9243.10 → 9245.12] Which is why I've said it on Sancho.
[9245.20 → 9245.78] We've said it elsewhere.
[9246.40 → 9246.78] Yeah.
[9247.02 → 9247.28] Um,
[9247.28 → 9248.54] so we're not going to like,
[9248.64 → 9248.96] you know,
[9249.00 → 9253.52] hire an entire team of anti AI experts to try to make our site less scrapable.
[9253.98 → 9254.34] Um,
[9254.34 → 9258.40] that's just not good use of our very limited resources.
[9258.52 → 9258.76] But like,
[9258.78 → 9261.14] I've had people directly reach out to me and be like,
[9261.20 → 9261.34] yeah,
[9261.36 → 9264.52] labs results ended up in like a ChatGPT thing.
[9264.58 → 9266.40] I was doing asking it questions and like,
[9266.46 → 9269.42] it was useful enough that I didn't check the site.
[9269.42 → 9269.98] And it's like,
[9270.04 → 9270.24] well,
[9271.24 → 9272.28] all right.
[9272.28 → 9273.80] that's how they get you.
[9274.20 → 9274.38] Yeah.
[9277.14 → 9277.58] Yeah.
[9277.66 → 9277.92] I mean,
[9277.96 → 9278.14] this,
[9278.26 → 9281.26] this genuinely explains how,
[9281.26 → 9281.92] you know,
[9282.04 → 9284.74] Nvidia can keep selling more consumer GPUs,
[9284.76 → 9288.12] which they report quarter after quarter growth in their GeForce business.
[9288.58 → 9290.16] But viewership on,
[9290.26 → 9290.44] you know,
[9290.48 → 9295.78] how to pick a GPU video doesn't necessarily go up because if people are just using AI,
[9295.94 → 9297.82] then that's all they need.
[9298.22 → 9298.44] Yes.
[9298.48 → 9300.22] I know about the humans.txt initiative.
[9300.34 → 9302.18] The problem is a lot of these things are just ignorable.
[9302.50 → 9307.60] It's if you look at the incentives of what is happening, and you're seeing the results of this in some places,
[9307.60 → 9313.92] it really sucks for most people because what's going to end up happening is a bunch of sites are going to die.
[9313.92 → 9323.12] And the ones that don't die are probably going to push heavier monetization models by putting their interesting stuff behind paywalls.
[9323.32 → 9323.40] Yeah.
[9323.72 → 9325.46] That's going to be the only way they can survive.
[9325.54 → 9327.20] I'm not even mad at them for it at this point.
[9327.46 → 9327.70] Yeah.
[9327.82 → 9329.98] They're doing what they have to do to survive.
[9330.10 → 9331.12] We're lucky.
[9331.50 → 9337.82] And also we got to give ourselves credit for seeing the writing on the wall a long time ago.
[9337.82 → 9339.34] And we've invested heavily in.
[9342.52 → 9343.12] Hey,
[9343.50 → 9344.82] buy a onesie.
[9345.42 → 9348.00] Make sure that we can keep doing the work we're doing.
[9349.62 → 9349.78] Yeah.
[9349.78 → 9358.94] Not everybody has that luxury of having other businesses to continue to support their media businesses through this very,
[9358.94 → 9360.98] very difficult period.
[9360.98 → 9367.14] I got to say a major sort of growing up moment for me or not even moment.
[9367.14 → 9368.14] thing I've experienced over,
[9368.14 → 9371.88] but thing I've experienced over,
[9371.88 → 9377.38] let's call it the last 10 years has been discovering to my dismay,
[9377.38 → 9383.42] how much of the general structure of the world was just,
[9383.42 → 9396.32] and order and stability was just built on like norms and good faith engagement rather than any kind of expectation of actual enforcement.
[9396.32 → 9397.42] That's still a thing.
[9397.80 → 9398.54] It is still a thing,
[9398.68 → 9400.62] but it's standards versus rules,
[9400.72 → 9400.90] right?
[9400.96 → 9401.30] If you,
[9401.38 → 9403.46] if you can live off of standards,
[9403.46 → 9405.98] you will probably have a better group of people.
[9406.14 → 9406.28] Yeah.
[9406.28 → 9409.06] But I feel like being the ability,
[9409.48 → 9415.62] my expectation of being able to rely on standards and people to uphold them is eroding.
[9415.62 → 9416.52] Oh no,
[9416.52 → 9416.80] for sure.
[9417.18 → 9419.78] I'm talking super broadly here.
[9419.78 → 9421.48] I'm talking like corporate teams,
[9421.60 → 9422.38] sports teams,
[9422.84 → 9424.10] government groups of friends,
[9424.20 → 9425.08] groups of people,
[9425.48 → 9426.54] government countries,
[9426.78 → 9427.64] whatever you want.
[9427.68 → 9427.96] If,
[9428.02 → 9428.54] if it can,
[9428.66 → 9430.56] if it can survive off of standards,
[9430.56 → 9433.08] that's like pretty much always better.
[9433.32 → 9436.20] This is the whole high trust versus low trust society thing.
[9436.26 → 9436.42] Yeah.
[9436.44 → 9437.26] I've talked about like if,
[9437.28 → 9440.78] if it is the standard of your society to be good to each other,
[9440.78 → 9444.44] then people will generally attempt to maintain that.
[9444.44 → 9446.34] But the problem is that you have to,
[9446.96 → 9451.92] the people themselves have to enforce that to a certain degree because you can't allow people to just.
[9452.80 → 9453.28] Yeah.
[9453.76 → 9454.24] And,
[9454.30 → 9460.72] and like authoritarian enforcement is not the answer.
[9461.06 → 9461.54] No.
[9462.14 → 9462.62] Um,
[9462.80 → 9463.04] well,
[9463.04 → 9464.22] that's kind of the whole idea.
[9464.32 → 9464.42] Yeah.
[9464.42 → 9466.40] The only way is you can go from,
[9466.84 → 9468.10] from the bottom up,
[9468.34 → 9470.86] upholding societal standards.
[9470.86 → 9472.26] And I just feel like we're,
[9472.26 → 9472.62] uh,
[9472.62 → 9474.84] I feel like we're in deep doo, doo here.
[9475.14 → 9475.40] Oh yeah.
[9475.40 → 9475.84] It's bad.
[9476.10 → 9476.42] But,
[9476.58 → 9477.82] but there are no consequences.
[9478.26 → 9479.70] And so I don't even,
[9479.94 → 9481.34] it's not even that there are no consequences.
[9481.54 → 9481.80] You have,
[9481.96 → 9482.38] you have this.
[9482.74 → 9482.96] There's,
[9483.04 → 9484.20] there are no consequences.
[9484.20 → 9486.42] They can completely ignore us saying,
[9486.54 → 9487.10] please no.
[9487.10 → 9488.64] And they win.
[9488.64 → 9489.12] But,
[9489.24 → 9491.08] and smaller companies get hurt by this.
[9491.08 → 9500.06] And companies like Micron are able to bail out of consumer spaces for massively more high profit things that are sitting here profiting off of small groups like that.
[9500.50 → 9500.98] Artists,
[9501.42 → 9501.78] uh,
[9501.78 → 9502.92] small publications,
[9503.40 → 9503.96] book writers,
[9504.52 → 9505.12] whatever,
[9505.12 → 9507.58] are all getting looted for all their stuff.
[9507.58 → 9509.78] And it's all funnelling up to these big companies.
[9509.78 → 9510.92] And then they're,
[9511.16 → 9517.72] what they're doing with that is making consumer spending more difficult because it's all being gathered by big corporate spending.
[9517.72 → 9519.58] Like it's the
[9519.66 → 9519.88] the
[9519.88 → 9520.22] the
[9520.22 → 9522.12] the cycle is much more involved,
[9522.12 → 9522.98] um,
[9522.98 → 9527.28] than I think even boomers would like to think is bad.
[9527.86 → 9529.28] And to be clear,
[9529.28 → 9530.04] like this is,
[9530.12 → 9532.24] and this is a really kind of tough one to,
[9532.42 → 9534.42] to kind of wrap my brain around is I also,
[9534.42 → 9537.44] I can understand why even maybe even,
[9537.44 → 9539.46] especially at the bottom,
[9539.46 → 9541.24] people are feeling so,
[9541.24 → 9545.58] so jaded and so left out by this system that they're sitting here going,
[9545.74 → 9545.92] well,
[9546.34 → 9547.90] if they don't have to follow the rules,
[9547.90 → 9549.72] then why should I,
[9550.00 → 9552.96] and they can end up harming each other a lot more.
[9552.98 → 9555.88] Then they end up harming our corporate overlords.
[9555.88 → 9558.72] I strongly agree with that when it comes to dealing with them.
[9559.16 → 9559.68] Uh,
[9559.68 → 9561.22] but ideally not each other.
[9561.84 → 9562.32] Um,
[9563.70 → 9564.06] yeah.
[9564.76 → 9565.24] Yeah.
[9568.20 → 9568.68] Ah,
[9569.64 → 9570.34] if it's because,
[9570.40 → 9573.52] if it's because says that's how I feel about drug dealers.
[9574.36 → 9574.84] Like,
[9575.08 → 9577.56] yeah,
[9577.58 → 9578.30] to be clear,
[9578.40 → 9578.72] I,
[9578.92 → 9581.50] I don't want anyone to be a drug dealer.
[9581.94 → 9584.10] I don't want anyone to have to be a drug dealer.
[9584.84 → 9587.00] It's sort of another way of saying the same thing.
[9587.86 → 9588.26] Um,
[9588.58 → 9595.70] and if someone was choosing between their family starving and dealing drugs,
[9596.40 → 9597.72] I can at least,
[9597.86 → 9599.68] I can at least understand,
[9600.04 → 9602.60] I can try to empathize with their position.
[9602.60 → 9605.00] I don't have to like it.
[9605.00 → 9607.12] I don't have to want that,
[9607.32 → 9610.88] that choice or that outcome for myself or for anyone,
[9610.88 → 9613.62] but you've got to at least,
[9614.14 → 9614.66] um,
[9614.66 → 9621.88] you've got to at least try to sort of put yourself in,
[9621.98 → 9623.04] in their mindset and go,
[9623.14 → 9623.26] okay,
[9623.26 → 9623.52] you know,
[9623.58 → 9623.86] why,
[9624.00 → 9625.18] why did they make that choice?
[9625.20 → 9625.70] And to be clear,
[9625.78 → 9626.00] not,
[9626.14 → 9628.92] not everyone is doing it out of necessity.
[9628.92 → 9630.46] I don't buy that for a second.
[9631.22 → 9631.62] Um,
[9632.28 → 9635.40] but at least some seem to be pretty stuck.
[9637.52 → 9637.92] Ah,
[9637.92 → 9641.34] cool.
[9642.12 → 9642.96] Very fun.
[9643.74 → 9644.56] Good chat.
[9644.82 → 9645.22] Um,
[9645.98 → 9649.82] I,
[9649.92 → 9652.32] I have just been sent some pictures of my,
[9652.32 → 9652.96] uh,
[9653.08 → 9654.32] Christmas party costume.
[9654.52 → 9656.46] I won't include the one when I'm standing.
[9656.66 → 9657.24] A lighter topic.
[9657.56 → 9657.84] Yeah,
[9657.96 → 9658.40] exactly.
[9658.56 → 9660.82] I won't include the one when I'm standing in the venue cause there's other
[9660.82 → 9661.54] people in the background.
[9661.66 → 9662.00] I know we,
[9662.08 → 9662.98] we don't do that.
[9662.98 → 9663.54] Uh,
[9663.92 → 9667.20] but I am going to include some of the photos of the actual getup.
[9667.28 → 9668.66] I'm just not wearing it in these photos.
[9669.62 → 9669.90] Um,
[9670.90 → 9671.42] Christmas.
[9673.02 → 9673.38] Uh,
[9673.38 → 9674.54] do you want me to do another thing in the meantime?
[9674.66 → 9675.02] Do you need a minute?
[9675.56 → 9676.60] I should be like,
[9676.60 → 9676.70] Oh,
[9676.74 → 9677.62] why don't I get through sponsors?
[9677.86 → 9678.08] 10 seconds,
[9678.14 → 9678.36] but yeah,
[9678.36 → 9679.24] I'll just be ready when you're done.
[9679.30 → 9679.40] Yeah,
[9679.40 → 9679.60] sure.
[9679.96 → 9680.24] All right.
[9680.24 → 9683.28] The show is brought to you by Sale back in September.
[9683.50 → 9688.36] We finally got smash champs all set up for an amazing whale land event.
[9688.66 → 9689.90] And to everyone who came,
[9690.02 → 9690.20] Hey,
[9690.20 → 9693.08] thank you so much for being part of it.
[9693.70 → 9697.38] We know that getting up here to the great white North is not easy for everyone.
[9697.68 → 9700.76] Travelling to another country is not always simple or affordable.
[9701.28 → 9705.84] One hurdle that visitors from say the U S might run into is getting hit with
[9705.84 → 9707.24] roaming fees while they're here,
[9707.32 → 9709.40] but our sponsor Sale can help.
[9709.78 → 9713.60] They'll help you save money with their easy to use E SIM service for less than
[9713.60 → 9716.12] the cost of a single day of roaming on the average carrier.
[9716.12 → 9719.30] You can get a full week with one gig of data while visiting Canada.
[9719.30 → 9722.26] Sale is a great choice for staying connected while travelling.
[9722.68 → 9724.38] And they offer 24 seven chat.
[9724.58 → 9725.62] If you need help anytime,
[9725.76 → 9726.56] anywhere,
[9726.74 → 9730.32] get an exclusive 15% discount on Sale data plans.
[9730.52 → 9731.92] Use code WINSLOW at checkout.
[9732.24 → 9736.60] You can download the Sale app or go to Saley.com slash WINSLOW.
[9736.60 → 9741.88] The show was also brought to you by odd pieces.
[9741.88 → 9745.12] Are you looking for a way to slow down?
[9745.88 → 9750.16] Spend some time with your partner or your kids and share something a little more
[9750.16 → 9753.10] interactive than rewatching the office for the ninth time.
[9753.78 → 9762.70] Odd pieces is a perfect cozy night with cocoa activity for couples who want to spend
[9762.70 → 9764.44] more quality time together.
[9764.58 → 9765.76] That's going to be a fanfic now.
[9766.52 → 9767.08] Oh,
[9767.08 → 9767.66] okay.
[9767.66 → 9768.50] Thank you.
[9769.16 → 9772.18] Odd pieces is not an ordinary puzzle.
[9772.68 → 9773.00] After,
[9773.24 → 9774.18] as you assemble it,
[9774.30 → 9779.66] you'll realize that the image on the box is only the first half of the story being told.
[9779.84 → 9787.00] The finished puzzle reveals what happens 15 seconds after with characters and objects moving around
[9787.00 → 9789.82] and many surprises to find.
[9791.04 → 9791.92] When you're done,
[9792.06 → 9801.56] there's also a sealed secret envelope that delivers a twist that you most likely won't see coming if you are ages 10 and under.
[9801.66 → 9801.80] Well,
[9801.90 → 9802.22] okay.
[9802.28 → 9802.70] With that said,
[9802.74 → 9803.66] I haven't done all of them.
[9804.04 → 9806.00] The twist for mine was pretty obvious,
[9806.24 → 9808.56] but your mileage may vary on that.
[9808.90 → 9811.60] Each box comes with a thousand premium pieces,
[9812.14 → 9813.16] two puzzle maps,
[9813.60 → 9813.92] comics,
[9814.18 → 9814.50] stickers,
[9814.50 → 9819.60] and an ultimate riddle turning a night at home into a little mini adventure.
[9820.30 → 9821.64] So connect with a loved one.
[9822.96 → 9823.48] Oh,
[9823.66 → 9824.04] okay.
[9825.78 → 9826.10] Okay.
[9826.70 → 9826.90] Hey,
[9826.96 → 9827.18] nice.
[9827.58 → 9829.18] So connect with a loved one,
[9829.46 → 9829.72] uh,
[9829.72 → 9830.76] like a puzzle piece.
[9831.12 → 9831.98] Can I get it?
[9832.06 → 9832.38] Yeah.
[9832.72 → 9838.38] This holiday season at 40% off, and you can save an extra 15% with code WINSLOW.
[9838.44 → 9841.68] Just check out that QR code that's on the screen right now.
[9841.80 → 9842.94] Odd pieces.
[9844.50 → 9845.60] All right.
[9847.20 → 9847.74] What do you,
[9847.78 → 9847.88] Oh,
[9847.92 → 9848.32] do you want to,
[9848.38 → 9849.22] are you showing your costume?
[9849.22 → 9849.24] Yeah,
[9849.30 → 9849.48] I can,
[9849.60 → 9849.98] I can do that.
[9849.98 → 9850.22] Actually,
[9850.28 → 9851.44] can I run to the washroom while you do that?
[9851.54 → 9851.88] Sure.
[9852.06 → 9852.20] Yeah.
[9852.20 → 9852.48] Yeah.
[9852.48 → 9855.68] So I always mentioned that I was tall grass.
[9856.26 → 9857.66] So my original idea,
[9857.94 → 9859.64] which was maybe okay,
[9859.74 → 9860.54] but not very good,
[9860.54 → 9866.18] was that I'd get a light green coloured shirt and some dark green fabric markers and just like,
[9866.18 → 9870.16] basically draw in a bunch of blades of grass,
[9870.16 → 9875.46] which because of the alternating colours of green would make it look like a bunch of different blades of grass.
[9875.46 → 9876.14] Uh,
[9876.14 → 9878.94] but then Emma got involved and made it way better.
[9878.94 → 9879.72] So now it was like,
[9879.72 → 9881.44] I was basically wearing a diorama.
[9881.94 → 9882.34] Uh,
[9882.34 → 9890.62] so there are a bunch of Pokémon trainers in the tall grass and tall grass is these like little 3d things that were glued onto the shirt.
[9890.62 → 9891.18] And there was,
[9891.28 → 9891.90] uh,
[9891.90 → 9894.26] these are totally butter freeze and not random,
[9894.26 → 9894.74] uh,
[9894.74 → 9896.50] butterfly things bought from a craft store.
[9896.78 → 9897.18] Uh,
[9897.20 → 9898.32] I did a little text box,
[9898.32 → 9899.08] uh,
[9899.08 → 9899.74] because you,
[9899.82 → 9904.46] you got an encounter with this particular trainer, and they like shorts because they're comfy and easy to wear,
[9904.56 → 9905.38] which is based.
[9906.14 → 9906.54] Um,
[9906.54 → 9908.04] and then there's the hat,
[9908.12 → 9909.08] which the hat was,
[9909.24 → 9910.02] was wild.
[9910.86 → 9911.30] Um,
[9911.30 → 9912.14] it was again,
[9912.14 → 9913.56] a little diorama this time with,
[9913.68 → 9915.26] with actual Pokémon involved.
[9915.48 → 9916.44] I didn't know it had a little card.
[9916.52 → 9917.08] It sounds so good.
[9917.16 → 9917.42] Yeah.
[9917.46 → 9917.98] There's a little,
[9918.08 → 9919.08] little mini sleeping,
[9919.26 → 9920.16] all the
[9920.16 → 9920.60] all the
[9920.60 → 9921.40] gen one starters,
[9921.72 → 9922.96] including the
[9922.96 → 9924.42] the Pikachu from yellow,
[9924.42 → 9925.20] um,
[9925.20 → 9929.08] all just having a little nap on top of the hat with some little mushrooms.
[9929.24 → 9932.26] There's a mushroom Pokémon moral that came later on,
[9932.26 → 9933.18] uh,
[9933.20 → 9934.40] a little wooden stump and stuff.
[9934.52 → 9936.00] This is actually a white hat,
[9936.50 → 9937.10] um,
[9937.40 → 9940.78] that she tried to paint some like grass kind of texture onto,
[9941.08 → 9942.36] which was wild.
[9942.36 → 9945.28] And then there's another angle of it here.
[9945.38 → 9946.92] It was quite the thing to wear,
[9947.30 → 9949.56] but it was awesome.
[9949.56 → 9949.96] Um,
[9949.96 → 9950.68] uh,
[9950.88 → 9951.24] yeah,
[9951.44 → 9952.16] it was cool.
[9952.72 → 9952.92] Emma,
[9953.02 → 9953.94] Emma did all that.
[9954.62 → 9955.60] It was fantastic.
[9956.64 → 9957.00] Um,
[9957.48 → 9959.78] secret level.
[9962.44 → 9962.72] Shh.
[9962.72 → 9965.32] Okay.
[9965.32 → 9965.72] Good call.
[9965.78 → 9966.08] Good call.
[9966.16 → 9966.46] Good call.
[9966.52 → 9966.96] I'm going to,
[9967.10 → 9967.30] no,
[9967.34 → 9968.18] I'm going to leave it where it was.
[9968.18 → 9968.46] Actually,
[9968.64 → 9969.34] you might not notice.
[9969.80 → 9971.08] I was thinking of turning it like that,
[9971.14 → 9974.32] but then I think the act of turning the chair might make him notice.
[9974.42 → 9974.66] We'll see.
[9974.72 → 9974.96] We'll see.
[9975.02 → 9975.24] We'll see.
[9975.28 → 9975.50] We'll see.
[9975.96 → 9976.36] Uh,
[9976.36 → 9976.88] good call.
[9976.94 → 9977.10] Everyone.
[9977.18 → 9977.46] Good call.
[9977.54 → 9977.86] Good call.
[9978.02 → 9978.32] All right.
[9978.44 → 9979.14] Let's see.
[9979.62 → 9980.12] What do we have?
[9980.22 → 9981.36] We should be talking about something.
[9981.42 → 9981.64] Is there,
[9981.76 → 9982.78] I can do another topic.
[9982.88 → 9983.16] Sure.
[9983.16 → 9983.44] Yeah.
[9983.44 → 9983.64] Hey,
[9983.68 → 9984.90] you got the crawler one.
[9985.02 → 9985.74] That's good.
[9986.30 → 9987.70] AWS and Google cloud.
[9988.18 → 9988.46] Yeah.
[9988.48 → 9990.18] Where's that underneath it?
[9990.46 → 9990.62] No,
[9990.68 → 9990.82] no,
[9990.86 → 9993.70] it's AWS and Google cloud interconnect announcement.
[9994.18 → 9994.70] Really?
[9994.92 → 10004.20] Part of this announcement is the introduction of an open source API to allow other cloud providers to adopt simplified connectivity for everyone.
[10006.46 → 10006.98] What?
[10007.32 → 10007.60] Uh,
[10007.60 → 10008.16] discussion question.
[10008.16 → 10013.42] We have seen in the last few months that these giant cloud services can effectively disable sections of the internet when they go down.
[10013.56 → 10013.84] Yes.
[10014.12 → 10017.62] How do you think introducing a new standard like this will affect the industry moving forward?
[10017.66 → 10017.74] Well,
[10017.74 → 10019.04] I don't know what the standard is.
[10019.72 → 10020.32] Um,
[10020.32 → 10021.12] totally fake.
[10021.18 → 10023.42] Arthur said that is actually super sick.
[10023.50 → 10024.36] It's crazy.
[10025.66 → 10026.14] Um,
[10027.92 → 10028.66] instead of envy link,
[10028.74 → 10029.50] it's AG link.
[10030.86 → 10031.38] Uh,
[10031.46 → 10032.80] I would like to know more.
[10032.86 → 10035.10] I feel like this maybe should have actually had some notes.
[10035.88 → 10036.36] Um,
[10037.60 → 10042.42] AWS announces preview of AWS interconnect multi-cloud providing.
[10042.42 → 10042.90] Oh,
[10042.90 → 10043.72] interesting.
[10045.86 → 10047.12] That'll be really expensive.
[10049.36 → 10050.70] Multi-cloud providing simple,
[10050.82 → 10051.12] resilient,
[10051.26 → 10055.90] high-speed private connections to other cloud service providers starting in preview with Google cloud.
[10056.00 → 10056.32] Okay.
[10056.46 → 10057.74] That is very interesting.
[10058.20 → 10058.60] Uh,
[10058.60 → 10062.56] I do really have to wonder how expensive that will be.
[10062.56 → 10067.20] I think it's going to be prohibitively expensive for a lot of places.
[10067.92 → 10068.40] Um,
[10068.40 → 10071.64] but we will see easy cloud migrations.
[10071.74 → 10071.84] Yeah.
[10071.88 → 10072.10] I mean,
[10072.10 → 10072.88] I get it now.
[10073.30 → 10073.78] Um,
[10073.78 → 10076.26] I just didn't fully understand it immediately from the
[10076.26 → 10077.26] uh,
[10077.26 → 10077.86] the notes.
[10077.86 → 10079.40] I should have paid more attention to the title.
[10080.26 → 10081.06] Um,
[10081.48 → 10082.86] yeah,
[10082.86 → 10084.04] I don't have access to that.
[10084.14 → 10084.52] Cool.
[10084.72 → 10085.08] Nice.
[10085.48 → 10086.04] Um,
[10086.04 → 10086.30] yeah,
[10086.30 → 10086.56] I mean,
[10086.56 → 10088.34] that sounds cool,
[10088.50 → 10089.04] interesting,
[10089.30 → 10089.76] resilient,
[10090.18 → 10090.86] um,
[10091.08 → 10093.16] but also probably very expensive.
[10093.16 → 10094.86] And we'll see how that goes.
[10096.70 → 10097.10] Hmm.
[10098.06 → 10101.22] You literally had to pay people to run actual wires in the data centre before.
[10101.36 → 10101.62] Yeah.
[10101.70 → 10102.00] I mean,
[10102.00 → 10103.02] you're still doing that.
[10103.10 → 10104.92] It's just being obfuscated from you.
[10105.34 → 10105.74] Um,
[10106.16 → 10107.56] that is totally still happening.
[10110.90 → 10111.60] I don't know.
[10111.78 → 10112.26] I don't know,
[10112.32 → 10112.54] guys.
[10112.66 → 10112.94] Uh,
[10112.94 → 10116.70] a lot of this cloud stuff is very expensive and like doubling it is also going to be very expensive.
[10116.70 → 10118.68] It will be really nice for resiliency though.
[10118.98 → 10120.84] Certain services will benefit from that a lot,
[10120.94 → 10122.90] but I think if you're expecting,
[10122.90 → 10124.88] like everyone to do that,
[10124.96 → 10125.76] uh,
[10125.80 → 10126.32] it's,
[10126.54 → 10126.78] yeah,
[10126.78 → 10128.94] it's going to be too much for a lot of places.
[10130.40 → 10130.84] Okay.
[10131.38 → 10132.68] Did you get the Google one?
[10134.02 → 10134.46] Hmm.
[10135.42 → 10135.88] Which one?
[10136.08 → 10137.34] Google has removed the call home.
[10138.88 → 10139.32] Yes,
[10139.34 → 10139.80] we did.
[10139.84 → 10140.76] We did talk about that one.
[10142.42 → 10142.86] Uh,
[10143.10 → 10146.42] new robots look like they could kick my butt.
[10146.48 → 10146.68] Okay.
[10146.68 → 10147.28] These are cool.
[10147.44 → 10150.66] Engine AI released a video showing off the new T 800 robots.
[10150.76 → 10151.64] Totally not a rip-off.
[10151.76 → 10152.14] Uh,
[10152.14 → 10153.44] it's surprisingly agile.
[10153.56 → 10157.12] It performs a bunch of martial arts moves like front kicks and roundhouse kicks.
[10157.56 → 10158.04] Uh,
[10158.06 → 10159.96] despite the no AGI,
[10160.32 → 10160.74] sorry,
[10160.98 → 10163.60] no AI slash CGI in the bottom left hand of the clip.
[10163.90 → 10165.42] Many comments don't believe it.
[10165.74 → 10169.58] Unitree responded with their own video a day later showing off the H2 robot.
[10169.58 → 10170.04] Hold on.
[10170.08 → 10170.24] Hold on.
[10170.26 → 10171.12] Can we look at this first?
[10171.24 → 10171.52] Yes.
[10171.52 → 10172.96] Yeah.
[10172.96 → 10173.64] That looks like,
[10173.70 → 10174.04] uh,
[10174.04 → 10175.90] this one look real at all.
[10175.94 → 10178.18] Billion percent looks like CGI.
[10178.52 → 10178.82] Yeah.
[10178.82 → 10179.86] That doesn't look real at all.
[10179.94 → 10180.24] Hold on.
[10180.28 → 10180.52] Hold on.
[10180.56 → 10180.88] Let's see.
[10180.94 → 10181.34] Let's see.
[10181.40 → 10181.78] Hold on.
[10181.78 → 10184.24] even like the lighting and stuff.
[10188.66 → 10189.08] Yeah.
[10189.08 → 10189.36] I don't,
[10189.44 → 10190.82] I don't even sort of believe this.
[10191.96 → 10192.40] Uh,
[10192.40 → 10196.46] if you're going to,
[10196.58 → 10198.28] if you're going to make that claim,
[10198.70 → 10201.54] why would you shoot it like this?
[10201.54 → 10201.82] Yeah.
[10202.08 → 10202.40] That's,
[10202.46 → 10204.28] that's why it's so strange.
[10204.28 → 10204.58] Hold on.
[10204.90 → 10207.96] Why doesn't the human ever interact with the robot?
[10208.08 → 10210.54] And their like face is covered with a hood the whole time.
[10210.60 → 10210.72] Well,
[10210.74 → 10210.86] no,
[10210.90 → 10211.54] that's fine.
[10211.62 → 10212.22] I don't mind that.
[10212.22 → 10213.84] Cause that human is probably there,
[10213.88 → 10215.38] but they never,
[10215.62 → 10217.12] they never touch each other.
[10217.24 → 10218.22] You notice that?
[10221.02 → 10221.50] Yeah.
[10222.00 → 10222.30] Like,
[10222.54 → 10224.36] like when Unitree does demo and stuff,
[10224.46 → 10224.96] they'll like,
[10225.14 → 10225.46] they'll,
[10225.58 → 10227.48] they'll like to kick the robot and stuff.
[10227.58 → 10227.70] Oh,
[10227.72 → 10228.54] you can see them there.
[10228.80 → 10228.94] No,
[10228.96 → 10229.04] no.
[10229.06 → 10229.26] I mean,
[10229.28 → 10230.38] but they never touch each other.
[10230.56 → 10230.78] Yeah.
[10230.84 → 10230.98] Yeah.
[10230.98 → 10231.18] Yeah.
[10231.60 → 10233.02] Do they ever cross over even?
[10233.14 → 10234.14] They get really close.
[10234.58 → 10239.94] This is the weirdest shot video ever.
[10240.20 → 10241.92] It could be a stunt.
[10242.34 → 10242.66] Wow.
[10242.74 → 10242.88] Yeah.
[10242.88 → 10243.56] It looks too good.
[10243.72 → 10245.56] I don't believe that it's this good,
[10245.56 → 10247.34] but it could be a
[10247.42 → 10247.82] oh man,
[10247.84 → 10250.40] this is the fakest looking video ever,
[10250.58 → 10250.84] dude.
[10250.94 → 10251.20] Like,
[10251.28 → 10253.94] why would you shoot it to look fake?
[10255.10 → 10259.86] This is what I was saying is I could see it be a strategy where they're trying to get people to claim that it's not fake.
[10259.86 → 10261.80] So then they can prove that it's real later.
[10261.96 → 10262.26] Sorry.
[10262.58 → 10263.36] Claim that it is fake.
[10263.46 → 10264.46] So it's real later.
[10264.46 → 10267.24] The one time anyone touches the robot.
[10267.38 → 10268.00] It's not moving.
[10268.08 → 10269.06] It's not moving.
[10270.10 → 10270.56] It's,
[10270.64 → 10271.82] I don't even think it's on.
[10275.00 → 10279.28] That is the most BS looking thing ever.
[10279.28 → 10279.96] And this,
[10280.18 → 10283.20] this looks more like the robot actually doing stuff.
[10283.40 → 10283.62] Yeah.
[10283.62 → 10290.22] And then this suddenly super doesn't.
[10293.90 → 10294.30] Okay.
[10294.44 → 10294.80] Anyway.
[10294.94 → 10295.18] Okay.
[10295.22 → 10296.28] So this is engine AI.
[10296.48 → 10296.70] Yeah.
[10296.70 → 10297.24] I don't know about that.
[10297.24 → 10297.54] Okay.
[10297.54 → 10298.30] And then.
[10298.30 → 10302.26] Unitree responded with their own video a day later showing off the H2 robot.
[10302.90 → 10303.16] Uh,
[10303.16 → 10309.66] their video starts with the 1.8 meter tall humanoid robot beating up a much smaller robot.
[10309.90 → 10313.46] Then it spars with a person and a bigger robot.
[10313.46 → 10318.46] See,
[10318.52 → 10322.02] this also looks kind of fake except,
[10322.24 → 10322.38] okay,
[10322.38 → 10323.84] there's actually people back here.
[10324.38 → 10325.84] And when we move on,
[10325.84 → 10331.38] this one feels a lot more real.
[10331.38 → 10333.48] They actually interact with the robot.
[10333.60 → 10334.84] It feels a lot more real.
[10335.78 → 10336.94] Even a lot of the movements,
[10337.04 → 10338.22] like it's surprisingly fluid,
[10338.32 → 10340.38] but it still has like the classic robotics.
[10341.14 → 10341.52] Like,
[10341.98 → 10342.38] you know,
[10342.56 → 10342.82] Oh,
[10342.86 → 10343.74] I am unstable.
[10343.74 → 10344.66] I will run,
[10344.76 → 10345.42] you know,
[10345.58 → 10348.34] algorithm thing to figure out how to become stable again.
[10348.50 → 10348.76] Yeah.
[10348.84 → 10350.30] Like little things like that,
[10350.36 → 10351.44] that little like struggle.
[10352.16 → 10354.32] That feels a lot more legit.
[10354.82 → 10355.18] Oh yeah.
[10355.18 → 10355.94] A hundred percent.
[10357.88 → 10358.28] Uh,
[10358.32 → 10361.28] that looked legitimately dangerous being in the ring with this thing.
[10362.22 → 10364.60] Like if it connected on one of these roundhouse kicks,
[10364.78 → 10365.28] check this out.
[10365.54 → 10365.92] Oh no,
[10365.96 → 10366.46] not this one.
[10366.52 → 10366.76] Never mind.
[10366.80 → 10367.12] Hold on.
[10367.76 → 10368.20] Here it is.
[10368.32 → 10370.38] Like if it had connected with that kick.
[10370.70 → 10370.88] Yeah,
[10370.88 → 10371.40] it could suck.
[10371.46 → 10372.48] That would have fricking hurt.
[10372.76 → 10373.32] That would suck.
[10373.36 → 10374.62] Like maybe injury hurt.
[10375.38 → 10375.74] Anyway,
[10376.10 → 10377.64] Unitree just can't stop winning,
[10377.78 → 10377.96] man.
[10380.78 → 10381.56] Like they,
[10381.86 → 10382.44] crazy.
[10382.66 → 10388.38] The whole industry is moving so fast that it would be impossible to tell us which horse is going to,
[10388.66 → 10391.36] or horse says more likely are going to win this.
[10391.38 → 10391.72] race.
[10391.96 → 10391.98] Well,
[10391.98 → 10392.96] based on those videos,
[10393.08 → 10395.82] I don't think engine AI is because I don't think they have a horse.
[10397.52 → 10397.96] Um,
[10398.36 → 10400.34] I don't know.
[10400.38 → 10401.92] That video is just so fake looking.
[10402.02 → 10402.58] It's ridiculous.
[10403.30 → 10403.66] Yeah.
[10406.04 → 10408.96] Like look at the lighting that would have been required for this intro.
[10409.32 → 10409.74] Hold on.
[10409.74 → 10413.42] Apparently the engine AI T800 video has behind the scenes.
[10413.52 → 10416.64] That's been released as a response to the fake CGI comments.
[10417.16 → 10417.88] All right,
[10417.96 → 10418.66] let's have a look.
[10420.46 → 10420.94] Okay.
[10420.94 → 10421.04] Okay.
[10423.00 → 10423.36] Okay.
[10423.36 → 10424.60] That looked more awkward.
[10425.40 → 10426.02] Hold on.
[10426.06 → 10426.42] Let's see.
[10427.38 → 10427.88] Hold on.
[10427.92 → 10428.06] Whoa,
[10428.06 → 10428.62] wait.
[10428.92 → 10429.30] Okay.
[10429.32 → 10429.80] This guy,
[10429.94 → 10430.90] this guy is moving.
[10431.64 → 10432.08] Okay.
[10432.18 → 10432.50] They've got,
[10432.70 → 10434.80] this doesn't do much to make me believe it.
[10434.90 → 10435.82] I'm just saying
[10435.82 → 10439.80] that helped a little.
[10440.16 → 10442.06] That's not the take that's in the video.
[10442.46 → 10442.90] No,
[10442.92 → 10443.42] it's not.
[10447.28 → 10447.72] Okay.
[10448.04 → 10448.48] Yeah.
[10448.48 → 10448.54] Yeah.
[10448.54 → 10449.54] Yeah.
[10450.94 → 10462.28] I want to see someone interact with this stupid robot.
[10475.00 → 10475.60] Hold on.
[10475.76 → 10476.02] Hold on.
[10476.06 → 10476.96] Is it going to touch something?
[10476.96 → 10477.28] Wait.
[10477.80 → 10478.70] What is Buddy here doing?
[10480.94 → 10483.36] Oh,
[10483.44 → 10483.72] okay.
[10483.80 → 10484.52] That's an action cam.
[10486.20 → 10487.36] I'm still skeptical.
[10490.06 → 10492.46] Show me it's doing something not badass.
[10493.98 → 10494.94] That's what I want.
[10502.68 → 10503.24] Hold on.
[10503.32 → 10503.46] Wait,
[10503.50 → 10503.58] wait,
[10503.58 → 10503.70] wait.
[10503.70 → 10505.10] I want to go back to that one for a second.
[10505.10 → 10506.58] So,
[10507.16 → 10508.16] where's the sun?
[10509.60 → 10510.02] Okay.
[10513.22 → 10513.70] Man,
[10513.80 → 10515.22] this looks so fake.
[10515.30 → 10515.70] Touch it.
[10515.96 → 10517.14] Somebody touch the robot.
[10518.86 → 10519.10] See,
[10519.24 → 10519.48] this,
[10519.60 → 10520.70] this is convincing,
[10520.90 → 10521.26] but again,
[10521.36 → 10521.48] it's,
[10521.58 → 10522.20] but then it cuts.
[10523.16 → 10523.92] I don't know,
[10524.04 → 10524.34] dude.
[10524.76 → 10526.00] I don't know,
[10526.08 → 10526.24] dude.
[10526.32 → 10526.58] I'm,
[10526.72 → 10529.60] I'm not very convinced right now.
[10535.10 → 10537.86] Okay.
[10537.98 → 10539.60] I still don't believe it.
[10544.60 → 10545.32] All right.
[10545.56 → 10546.04] I don't know.
[10546.06 → 10546.74] What do you guys think?
[10547.22 → 10548.10] What do you guys think?
[10548.18 → 10549.50] Did this help at all?
[10549.50 → 10552.80] Oh man.
[10552.84 → 10553.88] A lot of people saying the
[10553.92 → 10555.02] the behind the scenes,
[10555.16 → 10556.18] uh,
[10556.24 → 10557.98] makes it look even more fake.
[10559.98 → 10560.38] Oh,
[10560.50 → 10562.78] I,
[10562.86 → 10563.56] I don't know.
[10563.62 → 10564.06] I would,
[10564.16 → 10566.60] I need to see a human interacting.
[10566.72 → 10567.62] I'm also not like,
[10567.68 → 10568.32] like I said,
[10568.40 → 10574.38] it felt like a move where they wanted people to say that it looked fake so they could try to prove that it wasn't fake.
[10574.58 → 10579.48] And the non-behind the scenes video is only three days old, and they have the behind the scenes cut.
[10579.50 → 10580.10] Already Out.
[10580.58 → 10584.62] I feel like they're just trying to get in news headlines right now and they succeeded.
[10585.44 → 10585.92] You think so?
[10586.00 → 10586.98] That's my vibe check.
[10588.08 → 10590.00] That's some pretty good 4D chess.
[10590.54 → 10592.42] It feels very planned out though.
[10592.54 → 10592.80] Yeah.
[10592.98 → 10593.50] I don't,
[10593.60 → 10593.88] sure.
[10594.06 → 10594.26] Yeah.
[10594.64 → 10595.02] I mean,
[10595.10 → 10597.06] you plan when you play 4D chess.
[10598.02 → 10599.22] That's like the whole idea.
[10602.80 → 10603.82] I don't know.
[10605.72 → 10606.12] Yeah.
[10606.16 → 10606.36] Yeah,
[10606.44 → 10606.66] dude.
[10606.78 → 10607.10] Okay.
[10607.34 → 10607.74] Seriously.
[10608.12 → 10608.96] Scooby three says,
[10608.96 → 10610.70] the old push it back with a
[10610.70 → 10611.76] with a broom test.
[10611.84 → 10611.96] Yeah.
[10611.96 → 10612.86] I want to see that.
[10613.00 → 10614.16] I want to see it like,
[10614.34 → 10614.60] it's,
[10614.68 → 10614.92] it's,
[10615.00 → 10616.32] they're one day apart.
[10616.96 → 10620.20] I want to see it failing to do a bunch of spinning kicks.
[10620.36 → 10622.46] It's not just that this video is three days old.
[10622.56 → 10624.22] This one's only two days old.
[10624.68 → 10624.92] Yeah.
[10625.04 → 10625.16] I,
[10625.26 → 10625.40] well,
[10625.56 → 10625.82] oh no,
[10625.86 → 10627.12] that's immediately afterwards.
[10627.12 → 10627.66] That's true enough.
[10627.66 → 10628.06] but like,
[10628.06 → 10630.58] it's not like that took a lot of editing to do.
[10630.66 → 10632.86] Like they just chopped together some,
[10632.98 → 10633.72] some footage.
[10634.48 → 10634.88] Yeah.
[10635.20 → 10635.64] Like what,
[10635.70 → 10635.92] what's,
[10636.00 → 10637.82] they've got a bunch of other stuff on their channel.
[10637.94 → 10640.30] Setting the record straight on CGI rumours.
[10640.30 → 10640.70] So I,
[10640.76 → 10641.88] I really think it's,
[10641.94 → 10643.52] it's a publicity thing.
[10644.86 → 10645.22] Like,
[10645.26 → 10647.42] have they ever done anything in the past?
[10647.52 → 10647.82] Hold on.
[10647.92 → 10648.08] Uh,
[10648.50 → 10649.40] searching for their channel.
[10649.48 → 10650.24] Didn't bring it up for me.
[10650.30 → 10650.52] Can you,
[10650.60 → 10651.62] can you bring up their channel again?
[10652.26 → 10652.50] Uh,
[10652.52 → 10652.72] yeah.
[10652.84 → 10653.14] Oh wait,
[10653.16 → 10653.26] no,
[10653.30 → 10653.84] I found it now.
[10655.54 → 10658.06] Like they've got a bunch of videos on their,
[10658.14 → 10658.68] on their channel.
[10658.68 → 10660.10] Like do any of these other ones?
[10662.60 → 10662.96] Nice.
[10662.96 → 10669.44] Like this looks,
[10669.44 → 10676.02] this looks more believable.
[10677.36 → 10678.32] Hit it with a broom.
[10679.50 → 10680.60] Interact with it directly.
[10682.44 → 10683.08] Come on,
[10683.18 → 10683.32] speed,
[10683.46 → 10683.80] touch it.
[10683.86 → 10684.32] One time.
[10684.32 → 10684.70] Touch it,
[10684.76 → 10685.00] speed,
[10685.14 → 10685.72] touch it.
[10688.74 → 10689.44] I mean,
[10689.56 → 10689.74] yeah,
[10689.82 → 10690.04] that,
[10690.10 → 10691.18] that looked a lot more realistic.
[10691.42 → 10692.72] That looked a lot more realistic.
[10692.96 → 10695.96] Ah,
[10697.04 → 10698.60] okay.
[10698.98 → 10699.32] Well,
[10699.52 → 10701.58] when was this anyway?
[10702.72 → 10703.14] Oh shoot.
[10703.22 → 10707.22] I hate how hard it is to just find the stupid details.
[10707.34 → 10707.48] Okay.
[10707.54 → 10707.70] Yeah.
[10707.70 → 10709.52] You got to go find the hamburger menu and menu,
[10709.62 → 10710.28] then click description.
[10710.42 → 10711.88] So that was in April of this year.
[10712.58 → 10713.28] You know what?
[10713.48 → 10714.04] Let's see.
[10714.30 → 10715.46] Let's see how it goes.
[10715.70 → 10716.08] I,
[10716.18 → 10716.62] um,
[10717.04 → 10717.38] I,
[10717.50 → 10721.86] I agree with Luke that they're obviously playing a get in headlines game.
[10722.14 → 10722.54] Yeah.
[10722.96 → 10723.40] Um,
[10724.60 → 10725.34] until,
[10725.62 → 10730.78] until I see something that doesn't look quite as polished and staged and,
[10730.78 → 10732.08] um,
[10732.08 → 10738.90] and as devoid of real material interactions as even the behind the scenes here,
[10738.90 → 10742.22] I'm going to find this pretty darn hard to believe.
[10742.34 → 10746.52] And if they like hard scripted a bunch of movements that do look that good.
[10746.52 → 10755.92] And that's why some of the standard walking scenes look dramatically lower tech than the like martial arts scenes where they're like moving much more like you would expect.
[10755.92 → 10757.80] And then suddenly they're like fluid and dynamic.
[10757.80 → 10758.80] Maybe.
[10758.80 → 10759.08] Uh,
[10759.08 → 10759.66] maybe.
[10759.66 → 10760.86] But like a lot of these things,
[10760.86 → 10768.64] it looks like the like metal is almost bending in a way that like a human doing these types of movements would,
[10768.64 → 10771.84] would flex and bend when it like collides with the ground and stuff.
[10771.84 → 10774.12] And then you suddenly see the walking scenes is like,
[10774.20 → 10774.72] like,
[10774.72 → 10775.94] like,
[10776.04 → 10776.60] I just,
[10776.86 → 10777.70] I don't know.
[10777.80 → 10779.02] I have a hard time believing it at all.
[10779.10 → 10786.74] But if it is like hard scripted to happen specifically in like that room in that setting with that floor material and all that kind of stuff,
[10786.74 → 10788.54] maybe they've got something.
[10788.86 → 10789.14] Maybe.
[10789.38 → 10791.28] It's never useful to anyone really,
[10791.42 → 10791.96] but like,
[10792.06 → 10792.42] okay.
[10793.12 → 10793.50] Maybe.
[10794.30 → 10794.62] Yeah.
[10795.06 → 10795.54] I,
[10795.66 → 10795.90] I,
[10795.90 → 10796.54] I,
[10796.54 → 10799.28] I'm going to wait.
[10799.64 → 10805.12] I'm going to wait before just pronouncing this to be fake and before pronouncing this to be real.
[10805.62 → 10807.38] I'm not saying this as a fact,
[10807.62 → 10808.00] but I'm,
[10808.10 → 10809.76] I'm definitely siding on the
[10809.94 → 10810.54] it's fake side.
[10810.74 → 10812.02] And if it isn't fake,
[10812.10 → 10812.74] then I mean,
[10812.82 → 10813.16] hell yeah.
[10813.28 → 10814.58] I'm going to say it looks fake.
[10814.76 → 10815.16] All power to him.
[10815.28 → 10816.60] It for sure looks fake.
[10816.74 → 10817.20] And then,
[10817.26 → 10817.94] and then again,
[10818.44 → 10819.24] this part,
[10820.36 → 10821.62] like it might not all be fake.
[10821.96 → 10824.80] This part seems like it could be legitimate.
[10825.48 → 10828.02] This movement all seems pretty normal.
[10828.66 → 10829.10] Yep.
[10830.60 → 10833.40] Very kind of often one motor at a time.
[10833.46 → 10834.60] And then we're back to now.
[10839.40 → 10839.84] Yep.
[10839.94 → 10840.42] Fair enough.
[10841.42 → 10841.86] Um,
[10843.00 → 10843.94] anyway,
[10844.30 → 10845.96] we don't have any other like real topics,
[10845.96 → 10847.80] but there were a couple other things to talk about.
[10847.92 → 10848.10] My,
[10848.16 → 10848.32] uh,
[10848.32 → 10850.86] my son started a 3d printing business.
[10851.06 → 10851.42] Yeah.
[10851.74 → 10853.08] You're doing a video for that,
[10853.12 → 10853.26] right?
[10853.36 → 10853.58] Yeah.
[10853.64 → 10854.38] Like has to be.
[10854.56 → 10854.76] Yeah.
[10854.80 → 10855.62] That's amazing.
[10856.06 → 10856.30] Yeah.
[10856.36 → 10858.40] I've heard the story behind this, and it's incredible.
[10858.40 → 10858.76] I,
[10858.84 → 10859.04] uh,
[10859.04 → 10859.54] I took a
[10859.54 → 10862.02] I took a picture of him last night.
[10862.36 → 10862.84] Um,
[10862.84 → 10864.82] because he's actually the
[10864.88 → 10867.84] the first teenager that I've ever met in my entire life.
[10868.02 → 10871.92] Who's like the king of just getting a good night's sleep and,
[10872.04 → 10872.40] you know,
[10872.94 → 10874.84] being fresh in the morning.
[10875.48 → 10875.92] Um,
[10875.92 → 10877.62] and so this is,
[10878.08 → 10880.60] this is really unusual for him.
[10881.08 → 10881.52] Um,
[10881.72 → 10884.18] but he was like up really late last night.
[10884.18 → 10886.82] And so I got home from the Christmas party, and I was like,
[10887.02 → 10892.48] I went to say goodnight to all the kids and make sure that they were in bed.
[10892.98 → 10893.46] And,
[10893.54 → 10893.92] um,
[10893.92 → 10895.92] so my daughters were in bed, and I was like,
[10895.96 → 10896.38] that's good.
[10896.38 → 10901.06] And I went to pop my head into my son's room, and I was like,
[10901.06 → 10901.98] goodnight boy.
[10901.98 → 10904.16] And then you're not in here.
[10904.26 → 10904.64] Oh,
[10904.74 → 10905.66] lights on in your bathroom.
[10906.74 → 10907.18] You're,
[10907.26 → 10908.18] you're not in there either.
[10908.28 → 10909.28] Where the heck is he?
[10909.34 → 10909.48] Like,
[10909.56 → 10910.80] is he in the mechanical room again?
[10910.98 → 10915.06] Because he has been spending so much of his time down in the mechanical room.
[10915.50 → 10915.94] And,
[10915.96 → 10916.12] uh,
[10916.12 → 10916.30] Dan,
[10916.34 → 10917.30] I just sent you a picture.
[10917.78 → 10918.30] Uh,
[10918.30 → 10921.08] and this is the scene that I walked in on.
[10922.12 → 10923.52] I have never been prouder.
[10924.16 → 10924.84] Hell yeah.
[10925.30 → 10925.64] Uh,
[10925.82 → 10926.26] so what are,
[10926.32 → 10926.56] what are,
[10926.62 → 10927.84] so what are those Christmas trees?
[10928.20 → 10928.54] Uh,
[10928.60 → 10931.84] they're little fidget toys that are two spiral things.
[10931.98 → 10932.34] Oh,
[10932.38 → 10933.60] I've seen kind of,
[10933.74 → 10933.94] yeah.
[10934.02 → 10934.66] Go together.
[10934.66 → 10935.96] He has like a
[10935.96 → 10939.24] an entrepreneurship fair coming up at the school.
[10939.24 → 10940.92] And so he's bringing the
[10940.98 → 10942.02] the ones on the
[10942.02 → 10947.64] the bamboo that are closer to us are those little infinite fold fidget cubes.
[10948.18 → 10948.74] Um,
[10948.74 → 10953.12] and so he's bringing a bunch of like pre-printed stuff and then also promoting his,
[10953.12 → 10955.60] like choose your own,
[10955.60 → 10955.92] uh,
[10955.92 → 10956.66] 3d printing business.
[10957.34 → 10958.12] So he's been,
[10958.12 → 10958.62] uh,
[10958.62 → 10958.82] yeah,
[10958.82 → 10959.54] you can take it down now.
[10959.54 → 10963.86] So he's been learning a bunch of like 3d printing.
[10963.98 → 10971.18] He's learning about different filaments and like the different temperatures and odours and off gassing and like just like sort of all this various stuff.
[10971.24 → 10973.58] He keeps asking me to like buy more filament.
[10973.84 → 10975.84] And have you got him into flexible stuff yet?
[10975.84 → 10976.46] Not yet.
[10976.82 → 10977.18] Um,
[10978.16 → 10982.52] we have some,
[10982.70 → 10986.60] but most of the orders that he's getting are not for stuff that uses it.
[10986.66 → 10989.98] And right now he's having a hard time keeping up just with what people are requesting.
[10990.50 → 10990.94] Um,
[10990.94 → 10997.26] let alone going and just like exploring and finding interesting things to go and doesn't have to do as much product development yet.
[10997.26 → 10997.98] Um,
[10998.30 → 10998.72] we're,
[10998.82 → 10999.04] we're,
[10999.12 → 10999.94] I'm trying to,
[11000.14 → 11005.82] I'm trying to find a way to make him actually sort of think about the nuts and bolts of how to make this a business,
[11005.82 → 11007.94] but not make it just,
[11008.34 → 11008.72] you know,
[11008.98 → 11009.52] uh,
[11009.52 → 11010.76] impossible to overcome.
[11010.96 → 11013.00] Cause other than like sports,
[11013.00 → 11016.80] he's had a hard time finding like a hobby up until now.
[11016.84 → 11017.52] He loves gaming.
[11017.64 → 11018.52] He loves sports,
[11018.52 → 11021.00] but you can only play so many video games a day.
[11021.12 → 11021.60] Sorry.
[11021.72 → 11022.12] It's not,
[11022.18 → 11022.56] that's not,
[11022.56 → 11024.10] you're not going to be an e-sports pro,
[11024.32 → 11024.90] not in my house.
[11025.20 → 11025.56] Um,
[11025.56 → 11026.80] it's just not going to happen.
[11027.52 → 11027.92] Um,
[11027.94 → 11028.62] and you,
[11028.68 → 11029.64] you can only do much,
[11029.76 → 11033.52] so much physical activity before your body just must recover.
[11033.52 → 11035.20] And that's actually a healthy thing to do.
[11035.38 → 11036.78] And so he,
[11037.08 → 11037.30] uh,
[11037.30 → 11038.16] so he's finally,
[11038.72 → 11039.86] he's finally done it.
[11039.88 → 11042.58] He's like super dialled in.
[11042.58 → 11044.00] So the
[11044.00 → 11045.96] the balance that I,
[11045.98 → 11051.18] I think I found is that he has to pay me for filament by the weight that he uses.
[11052.60 → 11053.04] Interesting.
[11053.16 → 11053.36] Is that,
[11053.46 → 11055.50] so is that true when he's selling product?
[11055.56 → 11056.76] But not if he's making it for himself.
[11057.06 → 11057.46] Um,
[11057.46 → 11058.62] he doesn't make anything for himself.
[11058.66 → 11059.14] He doesn't care.
[11059.30 → 11062.46] He does not do like gadgets and stuff.
[11062.50 → 11062.98] He is like,
[11063.48 → 11063.66] dude,
[11063.72 → 11064.34] we'll go to,
[11064.46 → 11066.04] we'll go to Disneyland as a family.
[11066.14 → 11067.06] I kid you not.
[11067.46 → 11069.02] And the whole weekend,
[11069.02 → 11075.42] the girls are like hounding us for some princess thing or some dress or some wand or some balloon or whatever.
[11076.20 → 11076.64] Um,
[11076.76 → 11077.48] actually I shouldn't,
[11077.52 → 11079.16] I should give them more credit than that.
[11079.44 → 11081.38] Once they grew up a little bit,
[11081.50 → 11083.04] neither of them would hound us,
[11083.12 → 11089.14] but we do have sort of the rule in our house that they learn is that when we go on vacation,
[11089.14 → 11090.66] you can have one souvenir.
[11091.62 → 11093.04] Don't bother us about it.
[11093.66 → 11094.62] At the end,
[11095.16 → 11096.02] keep your eyes open.
[11096.02 → 11097.20] And then at the end,
[11097.36 → 11097.98] let us know.
[11098.42 → 11100.78] And if it's something within the budget that we set,
[11100.90 → 11101.64] then that's one.
[11102.10 → 11102.44] And that's,
[11102.58 → 11105.38] and don't bug us past that is sort of the rule that we have.
[11106.04 → 11106.40] Um,
[11106.40 → 11107.54] but anyway,
[11107.54 → 11112.34] so the girls will have their eyes out, and they'll be like chitter chattering at each other about what they like.
[11112.34 → 11112.56] And,
[11112.90 → 11112.96] Oh,
[11112.98 → 11114.14] if we each get one of these,
[11114.18 → 11115.28] then we can play that together.
[11115.44 → 11115.46] And,
[11115.54 → 11118.94] and at the end we'll be like,
[11119.54 → 11119.88] okay,
[11120.04 → 11120.60] we've done,
[11120.66 → 11121.88] we've done our shopping for the girls.
[11122.00 → 11122.34] Boy,
[11122.38 → 11122.80] do you want anything?
[11122.88 → 11123.12] And be like,
[11123.16 → 11123.30] no,
[11124.30 → 11124.80] you sure?
[11124.90 → 11125.40] Like they,
[11125.48 → 11126.84] they have built your own lightsabre.
[11127.12 → 11127.36] No,
[11128.20 → 11129.06] they have like,
[11129.18 → 11130.84] here's the thing you could put on your wall.
[11131.32 → 11131.48] No,
[11131.50 → 11132.40] I got stuff on my wall.
[11133.00 → 11133.58] All right.
[11134.50 → 11134.98] All right.
[11135.02 → 11135.36] That's cool.
[11135.36 → 11135.70] He's just,
[11135.80 → 11137.70] he's really not materialistic anyway.
[11138.44 → 11138.84] Um,
[11139.64 → 11142.28] so we charge him for filament by the weight that he uses,
[11142.44 → 11144.40] not by the spools that we order.
[11144.52 → 11145.86] So if there's like a colour he needs,
[11146.12 → 11147.28] I'll just order it.
[11147.54 → 11150.64] And then I'm like the like bulk distributor.
[11150.80 → 11150.98] Yeah.
[11151.06 → 11153.44] He only has to like pay for what he uses.
[11153.56 → 11154.88] I think that's pretty reasonable.
[11155.08 → 11155.76] Seems all right.
[11155.76 → 11157.74] And then if he needs any other materials,
[11157.94 → 11159.32] that's his problem.
[11159.50 → 11162.82] So he placed his first order with McMaster car last week.
[11163.04 → 11163.26] Nice.
[11163.26 → 11170.88] He ordered some magnets and some like M2 screws, and he's using it to make a little rubber band guns.
[11170.96 → 11171.58] And I told him,
[11171.66 → 11174.26] no black ones.
[11177.14 → 11177.66] Yeah.
[11177.66 → 11177.96] That's a
[11177.96 → 11179.04] that's a specific,
[11179.04 → 11181.06] no black guns.
[11181.94 → 11184.76] So the first one he made was like in lilac.
[11184.98 → 11187.26] That's a Canadian legal thing just for anyone.
[11187.38 → 11187.66] Yeah.
[11188.54 → 11190.90] Do not 3d print a black gun.
[11190.90 → 11191.00] No,
[11191.00 → 11191.56] it's not racist.
[11191.94 → 11192.90] And take it to school.
[11192.94 → 11193.32] Okay.
[11193.48 → 11194.16] Oh my God.
[11194.86 → 11195.34] Oh,
[11195.74 → 11196.58] he's talking.
[11196.74 → 11197.62] Oh man.
[11197.62 → 11198.92] It's not racist.
[11200.50 → 11200.94] Stop.
[11201.26 → 11201.46] Uh,
[11201.46 → 11202.02] they know,
[11202.10 → 11203.12] they know they're just teasing.
[11203.32 → 11203.38] Luke,
[11203.46 → 11203.74] calm down.
[11203.82 → 11207.24] So the first one he made was in like lilac.
[11207.40 → 11208.18] And I was like,
[11208.36 → 11208.84] yes,
[11209.64 → 11210.30] approved.
[11211.78 → 11212.56] But like,
[11213.10 → 11216.46] he intended to make the first one in black.
[11216.64 → 11216.88] Yeah.
[11217.14 → 11217.36] Of course.
[11217.36 → 11217.84] And I was like,
[11217.90 → 11218.18] boy,
[11218.32 → 11221.06] I do not want a letter from the school about this.
[11222.06 → 11222.46] Please,
[11222.58 → 11223.96] for the love of all that is good.
[11224.02 → 11225.08] It's going to be a letter from the government.
[11225.28 → 11225.64] Oh,
[11226.06 → 11226.46] and so,
[11226.56 → 11228.44] and he's also making these like cool floppy.
[11228.56 → 11229.32] They have to be like,
[11229.50 → 11230.64] oh my goodness.
[11231.10 → 11232.02] Make them in fun.
[11232.02 → 11233.26] They need to be Fisher Price colours.
[11233.36 → 11233.68] Yes.
[11233.82 → 11235.42] Make them in fun toy colours.
[11235.78 → 11236.92] That's all I ask.
[11237.00 → 11237.18] Yeah.
[11237.84 → 11238.28] Um,
[11238.34 → 11238.60] yeah.
[11239.72 → 11240.20] So,
[11240.50 → 11241.26] um,
[11242.16 → 11242.60] anyway,
[11242.70 → 11243.10] where was,
[11243.20 → 11243.44] uh,
[11243.48 → 11244.52] where was I going with this?
[11245.10 → 11245.54] Um,
[11245.90 → 11246.14] yes.
[11246.48 → 11247.10] So he's got his,
[11247.10 → 11247.40] Oh yeah,
[11247.40 → 11247.60] right,
[11247.60 → 11247.74] right,
[11247.74 → 11247.90] right,
[11247.90 → 11248.04] right,
[11248.04 → 11248.18] right,
[11248.18 → 11248.30] right.
[11248.36 → 11250.84] So he needed like these M2 screws and,
[11250.90 → 11251.16] um,
[11251.16 → 11252.52] and magnets because it's got,
[11252.60 → 11256.38] it's got kind of a cool element to the design where you glue in some magnets, and it has
[11256.38 → 11257.62] like a removable magazine.
[11257.80 → 11259.30] The magazine doesn't do anything,
[11259.40 → 11263.20] but it's like you print out two mags, and it comes with a couple of mags, and they like
[11263.20 → 11264.36] magnet it and whatever.
[11264.58 → 11264.68] Right.
[11264.72 → 11265.04] Like kids,
[11265.12 → 11265.78] kids love that stuff.
[11265.80 → 11266.24] It's a toy.
[11266.44 → 11266.60] Yeah,
[11266.60 → 11267.08] exactly.
[11267.26 → 11268.56] That's why it's not black.
[11269.18 → 11269.58] Um,
[11270.12 → 11271.58] so we,
[11271.76 → 11272.18] um,
[11273.22 → 11275.00] so he ordered that, and he's like,
[11275.26 → 11275.54] yeah,
[11275.60 → 11276.06] the
[11276.06 → 11276.38] the
[11276.38 → 11278.00] the shipping cost is so high.
[11278.04 → 11278.30] I'm like,
[11278.38 → 11278.58] yep.
[11278.74 → 11279.12] He's like,
[11279.12 → 11281.14] I can't buy just two M2 screws.
[11281.18 → 11281.46] I'm like,
[11281.54 → 11281.78] nope.
[11281.92 → 11282.38] He's like,
[11282.38 → 11283.88] I'm going to have to sell like six of these.
[11283.90 → 11284.28] And I'm like,
[11284.32 → 11284.52] yep.
[11284.74 → 11288.22] And so that's why I want to have him like paying for some of his,
[11288.34 → 11288.46] yeah,
[11288.56 → 11288.98] that's cool.
[11288.98 → 11290.28] I don't charge him for machine time.
[11291.08 → 11295.70] I think I've decided now I'm not going to charge him for any like upgrades to the machines.
[11295.96 → 11297.18] So the print farm,
[11297.58 → 11301.58] he gets free time on it as long as he shares with his sisters because they like to print
[11301.58 → 11302.28] toys for themselves.
[11302.44 → 11304.22] Neither of them are really selling things at this point.
[11304.78 → 11305.16] Um,
[11305.16 → 11310.42] and then he has to pay by fulfillment by weight that he only what he uses and then anything
[11310.42 → 11315.04] else that he needs to make like cool designs and stuff seems extremely reasonable at this
[11315.04 → 11315.30] point.
[11315.42 → 11320.32] And then Yvonne's really encouraging him to start tracking all of his expenses and all
[11320.32 → 11326.04] of his revenues in a spreadsheet to make sure that he's like paying himself at least a break
[11326.04 → 11327.60] even and hopefully like,
[11328.06 → 11329.46] like an amount of money that's worth it.
[11329.46 → 11330.54] Because as you could see,
[11330.66 → 11332.52] he's spending a lot of time on this.
[11332.62 → 11333.82] Now it's a mess right now.
[11334.14 → 11337.40] And the first thing he said when I walked in the room was I'll clean it up tomorrow.
[11337.68 → 11338.40] And I was like,
[11338.46 → 11339.14] honestly,
[11339.60 → 11341.84] I'm not even mad.
[11341.94 → 11342.24] Yes,
[11342.46 → 11343.36] do clean it up tomorrow,
[11343.36 → 11345.52] but I'm not even mad about this.
[11345.64 → 11345.88] Uh,
[11345.88 → 11350.22] last night I was in the bath, and he came in and interrupted me three times because there are a
[11350.22 → 11355.62] bunch of filaments got stuck on the outside of one of the hot ends, and he was like trying to swap
[11355.62 → 11360.92] out for another nozzle, and he was like working on extracting the ceramic heating element and like
[11360.92 → 11365.74] putting the temperature probe in and a bunch of like EGG filament had gotten kind of stuck on it.
[11365.82 → 11366.38] And they ended,
[11366.50 → 11368.64] he ended up breaking it, and I'm just like,
[11368.70 → 11370.72] I'm not even mad.
[11371.26 → 11374.74] This is honestly like such a proud dad moment right now.
[11374.82 → 11376.30] I will buy you a new heating element.
[11376.46 → 11376.60] Yeah.
[11376.66 → 11378.28] I don't even care right now.
[11378.42 → 11378.58] Yeah.
[11378.58 → 11381.90] I'm just so glad that for the first time in your life,
[11381.90 → 11388.78] you are like dialled the in learning this stuff and,
[11388.88 → 11391.12] and like highly interested in it.
[11391.24 → 11396.42] So he accidentally ordered slightly the wrong size magnets or rather McMaster car was an Imperial
[11396.42 → 11398.24] and the file was,
[11398.48 → 11400.24] was in a metric.
[11400.42 → 11400.76] No,
[11400.82 → 11401.38] this is great.
[11401.44 → 11403.36] It's a good lesson because,
[11403.36 → 11404.56] um,
[11404.56 → 11404.88] um,
[11404.88 → 11404.94] um,
[11404.94 → 11405.88] my daughter,
[11405.88 → 11411.06] my middle child is actually more interested in learning the modelling side.
[11411.64 → 11415.54] And so they don't always interact a ton.
[11415.54 → 11418.52] There's a couple of year age gap and there's the gender gap.
[11418.52 → 11424.36] The gender gap is big and kids socially will tend to be like water or electricity.
[11424.60 → 11425.30] They will,
[11425.44 → 11428.02] they will take the path of least resistance very often.
[11428.02 → 11434.42] So when the two girls are a pretty similar age gap and the girl and the boy are a pretty similar age gap,
[11434.54 → 11441.08] there's a tendency for the two girls to just do girly things together and for my son to be kind of left out.
[11441.08 → 11445.68] And so that was such a cool parent moment when she helped them with it,
[11445.80 → 11448.82] this strategic decision that I made a year ago,
[11448.82 → 11450.08] because I don't know if you remember this,
[11450.14 → 11453.36] but the 3d printer was a Christmas present for the whole family with,
[11453.46 → 11455.22] with an ulterior motive,
[11455.34 → 11456.04] right?
[11456.04 → 11457.74] I wanted them to learn this stuff.
[11457.82 → 11458.06] I want,
[11458.14 → 11464.16] I was going to help them with it until I stopped until they got into it enough that when I stopped,
[11464.24 → 11465.72] they'd be motivated to keep it going.
[11465.72 → 11466.80] And anyway,
[11466.80 → 11473.52] it was really cool to see them work together and figure out how to modify the model to make the magnets that he ordered work.
[11474.04 → 11474.60] And it was like,
[11474.66 → 11475.16] ah,
[11475.32 → 11476.32] proud parent moment.
[11476.44 → 11476.86] Let's go.
[11477.40 → 11477.70] Super cool.
[11477.86 → 11478.02] Yeah.
[11478.30 → 11478.74] Yeah.
[11478.74 → 11479.80] So I,
[11479.80 → 11480.58] I,
[11480.58 → 11481.76] I did warn my son.
[11481.82 → 11482.16] I was like,
[11482.18 → 11482.38] okay,
[11482.38 → 11490.08] you do need to keep this like kind of low profile because otherwise the school could tell you that you're like not allowed to do it anymore.
[11490.42 → 11491.46] That did happen.
[11491.68 → 11491.80] My,
[11491.90 → 11495.70] there was some kid at my school that had a locker full of like snacks and stuff that he had to do.
[11495.72 → 11497.82] He would sell, and he got shut down.
[11498.00 → 11503.44] So the school did send out a memo about a week after I warned him.
[11503.44 → 11503.66] Cause,
[11503.94 → 11504.62] because he was like,
[11504.64 → 11504.96] oh yeah,
[11504.96 → 11509.36] I'm going to like to have a bunch of them like hanging off my bag, and I'm going to put a sign on my backpack.
[11509.70 → 11510.08] It says,
[11510.26 → 11511.44] so,
[11511.72 → 11512.14] so,
[11512.28 → 11513.28] um,
[11513.28 → 11514.96] they sent out a memo to their credit.
[11515.10 → 11517.10] They were actually pretty chill about it.
[11517.36 → 11519.36] Not because this is for the entrepreneurship fair.
[11519.68 → 11522.88] Like this is what he was doing in that picture is official school business.
[11523.02 → 11523.18] Yeah.
[11523.44 → 11523.84] Um,
[11523.84 → 11525.18] he's also selling snow cones.
[11525.72 → 11529.26] So Yvonne helped him with that side of it, and I've been helping him with the 3d printer side.
[11529.86 → 11530.22] Um,
[11530.82 → 11531.76] and so that's like,
[11531.88 → 11532.16] uh,
[11532.16 → 11532.82] that's like a
[11532.82 → 11534.74] an officially sanctioned thing during school hours.
[11534.74 → 11535.60] And then for the
[11535.72 → 11537.44] for the just like on the side stuff,
[11537.44 → 11538.90] basically what they said was,
[11538.98 → 11539.16] look,
[11539.40 → 11542.32] you can't exchange money during school hours or on school property.
[11543.46 → 11544.74] You can talk about it.
[11544.74 → 11546.06] or on school property.
[11546.20 → 11546.32] Yeah,
[11546.32 → 11550.16] but that's fine because you can just step one step off of walk,
[11550.22 → 11550.80] uh,
[11550.80 → 11551.88] out during lunch.
[11551.88 → 11553.56] Cause you said,
[11553.72 → 11554.72] or both.
[11555.16 → 11555.42] Okay.
[11555.42 → 11556.02] And yeah.
[11556.10 → 11556.32] And,
[11556.40 → 11556.68] okay.
[11556.80 → 11557.14] So,
[11557.14 → 11559.02] so basically they could just,
[11559.22 → 11561.82] they just have to like to arrange to meet after school.
[11562.46 → 11563.38] And I was like,
[11563.42 → 11563.86] you know what?
[11564.44 → 11565.86] That's actually pretty chill.
[11565.98 → 11566.50] They're not like,
[11566.58 → 11567.98] you can't talk about it at all.
[11568.08 → 11568.42] You can,
[11568.42 → 11570.92] they didn't like ban 3d printed fidget toys.
[11571.00 → 11572.24] That seems reasonable to me.
[11572.32 → 11574.10] That seems perfectly reasonable.
[11574.10 → 11574.90] Totally reasonable.
[11575.14 → 11577.54] So I told him during the entrepreneurship fair,
[11577.90 → 11580.74] he should not only sell the fidget toys and stuff,
[11580.74 → 11587.56] but he should 3d print like little like challenge coins that just have liked his name and his grade or something.
[11587.72 → 11589.68] Just so that people like know.
[11589.90 → 11591.36] Cause that's super cheap.
[11591.50 → 11592.76] So that's a marketing expense.
[11592.90 → 11593.60] And just give them out.
[11593.72 → 11595.52] So now you're teaching him about marketing.
[11595.52 → 11595.60] Yeah,
[11595.60 → 11595.74] buddy,
[11595.84 → 11596.34] let's go.
[11596.60 → 11597.52] That's sick.
[11597.52 → 11599.14] Teaching business.
[11599.74 → 11605.48] What would be kind of neat is if you got them to print some stuff that might be interesting for,
[11605.54 → 11607.96] I'm assuming this business fair,
[11608.14 → 11608.82] whatever thing.
[11609.24 → 11609.64] Uh,
[11609.64 → 11610.80] it's not just kids,
[11610.86 → 11611.06] right?
[11611.48 → 11611.76] Uh,
[11611.82 → 11612.74] parents are going to,
[11613.02 → 11613.42] uh,
[11613.46 → 11613.58] no,
[11613.62 → 11614.22] it's just kidding.
[11614.44 → 11614.60] Oh,
[11614.66 → 11614.84] okay.
[11614.92 → 11615.10] Yeah.
[11615.36 → 11615.84] Never mind then.
[11616.26 → 11617.84] I was going to say if there were parents going,
[11617.94 → 11620.08] I would like to print some stuff that they might be interested in as well.
[11620.14 → 11622.24] Then they could place orders through their kids.
[11624.74 → 11626.40] Then it might get shut down.
[11627.52 → 11628.60] That would be sick.
[11628.60 → 11630.52] All it takes is one parent to complain.
[11630.92 → 11631.44] Oh my God.
[11631.74 → 11637.50] He could set up a really basic website and just have it be like that you reserve an order.
[11637.98 → 11640.04] And then he could bring it to school.
[11641.06 → 11641.46] Technically,
[11641.62 → 11643.42] the sale happened through the website.
[11643.60 → 11644.42] He's thought of that.
[11644.48 → 11648.20] And he has a classmate that wants to build the website for him and like partner with him.
[11648.20 → 11648.96] And I'm just like,
[11649.04 → 11653.24] I'm not going to interfere with that because I think he could probably do it himself,
[11653.24 → 11655.36] but I want the classmate to learn too.
[11655.44 → 11660.06] And I want them both to learn that going into business together has advantages about that and
[11660.06 → 11665.00] disadvantages and relationships are complicated and sometimes can be very fruitful and sometimes
[11665.00 → 11666.00] can be very challenging.
[11666.00 → 11669.32] These are all just things that like,
[11669.32 → 11674.24] I was a decade from starting to learn when I was his age.
[11674.34 → 11674.48] Yeah.
[11674.60 → 11674.76] Yeah.
[11674.76 → 11675.00] Yeah.
[11675.18 → 11675.44] Right.
[11675.56 → 11675.76] Like,
[11675.80 → 11675.98] yeah,
[11675.98 → 11676.22] yeah.
[11676.48 → 11676.78] No,
[11676.80 → 11677.78] that's a super valuable,
[11677.90 → 11678.04] super,
[11678.14 → 11678.56] super valuable.
[11678.78 → 11681.24] My thing with the online purchasing is you could,
[11681.46 → 11682.92] they didn't say anything about distribution.
[11682.92 → 11685.04] So if the payment happened,
[11685.04 → 11688.68] it can be distributed just fine.
[11688.80 → 11688.98] Yeah.
[11689.10 → 11689.78] I mean,
[11689.96 → 11692.16] I don't know exactly what the wording was.
[11692.22 → 11693.06] Do they have lockers?
[11693.78 → 11694.12] Uh,
[11694.14 → 11694.50] yes.
[11695.42 → 11696.00] Oh man.
[11696.06 → 11696.18] Yeah.
[11696.18 → 11697.30] I like this idea too much.
[11697.32 → 11697.66] I know.
[11697.74 → 11698.10] I know.
[11698.14 → 11698.32] Right.
[11698.34 → 11698.58] It's,
[11698.66 → 11699.40] it's so cool.
[11699.48 → 11702.66] Because he could set up a relatively small printer in there and then if the transaction
[11702.66 → 11703.66] happened online,
[11703.78 → 11705.36] he could do like ready to order.
[11707.88 → 11708.70] That's too far.
[11708.82 → 11709.90] They would definitely,
[11710.08 → 11712.74] the second there's an extension cord running into his locker,
[11712.92 → 11714.84] you could get like a
[11714.84 → 11715.38] uh,
[11715.38 → 11715.84] what are these?
[11716.02 → 11716.90] Hackery or something.
[11716.90 → 11717.82] You could get a hackery dog.
[11718.90 → 11720.66] There's an answer for everything,
[11720.88 → 11720.98] dude.
[11720.98 → 11721.36] Oh my God.
[11721.40 → 11722.90] There's an answer for all things.
[11723.02 → 11724.00] All things are solvable.
[11724.36 → 11725.66] Ahead says,
[11726.20 → 11728.76] it's just sad that 3D printing is at this point,
[11729.02 → 11731.08] mostly just churning out other people's work and selling it.
[11731.78 → 11732.10] I,
[11732.36 → 11735.50] I would offer an alternate perspective.
[11735.96 → 11736.24] Coding?
[11736.84 → 11737.24] Um,
[11738.10 → 11738.58] no,
[11738.58 → 11739.10] libraries.
[11739.34 → 11739.80] I mean,
[11739.84 → 11740.12] even,
[11740.44 → 11740.66] okay,
[11740.92 → 11741.42] let me just,
[11741.42 → 11742.82] do you write your own random number?
[11742.82 → 11743.70] Let me,
[11743.78 → 11746.66] let me offer an alternate perspective.
[11747.12 → 11748.76] We're talking about kids here.
[11749.72 → 11755.58] The fact that my kids used our 3D printer exclusively as a toy factory,
[11755.58 → 11758.02] just printing other people's designs.
[11758.20 → 11759.10] In this case,
[11759.34 → 11760.00] selling them.
[11760.58 → 11762.60] You could see that as a bad thing,
[11763.00 → 11764.76] but let me pitch the
[11764.88 → 11765.16] the
[11765.26 → 11765.44] the
[11765.44 → 11767.50] you have to get your feet wet somewhere.
[11767.72 → 11769.86] Let me pitch the education angle.
[11769.86 → 11770.52] Yeah.
[11770.52 → 11770.68] Like,
[11770.82 → 11780.30] they were never going to have to learn to widen that magnet mount hole if they didn't have someone order someone else's design.
[11780.30 → 11780.48] Dude,
[11780.56 → 11783.84] the collaborative aspects of that is so freaking cool.
[11783.84 → 11790.12] And they're never going to learn to make a better magazine that goes into the
[11790.12 → 11790.60] the
[11790.68 → 11790.90] the
[11790.90 → 11794.84] the gun design better if they never learned to widen that hole.
[11795.06 → 11797.26] And they're never going to create their own,
[11797.26 → 11798.26] you know,
[11798.34 → 11805.54] elastic gun design from scratch if they never made that magazine modification or built a cool accessory that goes on the rail.
[11805.54 → 11807.48] You have to start somewhere.
[11807.80 → 11809.72] It could end up turning into a thing where your,
[11809.72 → 11811.36] your daughter's fun,
[11811.54 → 11816.90] cool toy design models end up being what your son is like peddling at school.
[11817.10 → 11821.42] And there's some form of like profit sharing agreement between the two or something.
[11821.54 → 11822.06] Who knows?
[11822.60 → 11825.32] Like it's all paths from here are pretty cool,
[11825.32 → 11828.00] except for a path where it gets fully shut down.
[11828.00 → 11829.52] And I'm happy that the school,
[11829.62 → 11829.98] you know,
[11830.00 → 11831.88] did a fairly reasonable thing.
[11831.88 → 11832.66] I'm being like,
[11832.70 → 11833.00] you know what?
[11833.04 → 11834.38] Don't sell these on ours.
[11834.50 → 11835.20] Don't overdo it.
[11835.20 → 11835.56] Yeah.
[11835.70 → 11837.24] Which seems totally reasonable.
[11837.56 → 11837.90] The brakes.
[11838.18 → 11838.66] Um,
[11838.74 → 11842.06] but I'm happy that they didn't completely shut it down because I mean,
[11842.06 → 11842.32] there's,
[11842.40 → 11843.76] there's weird aspects of that too,
[11843.80 → 11843.96] right?
[11843.96 → 11846.94] Cause like we're sitting here thinking of ways that he can kind of work around it.
[11847.02 → 11848.52] That is part of business.
[11849.64 → 11852.76] Making sure that you can operate as optimally as possible,
[11852.76 → 11856.42] but not break the rules is literally part of running business.
[11856.74 → 11857.02] Um,
[11857.02 → 11860.40] so like is actually a good lesson for him to understand that.
[11860.40 → 11862.36] Like if he pushes it too far,
[11862.46 → 11864.48] they have the power to shut him down.
[11864.48 → 11865.84] So he shouldn't do that,
[11866.04 → 11869.34] but it is a reasonable thing to push it a little bit and like,
[11869.40 → 11869.86] try to,
[11870.04 → 11871.14] try to do what he can.
[11871.58 → 11871.98] Um,
[11871.98 → 11873.56] I think this is amazing.
[11873.72 → 11874.94] I heard this concept,
[11875.04 → 11875.68] not all these details,
[11875.76 → 11879.34] but I heard the concept and like immediately basically begged that there'd be a video.
[11879.34 → 11879.74] And they're like,
[11879.78 → 11879.90] yeah,
[11879.90 → 11880.02] yeah,
[11880.02 → 11880.18] yeah,
[11880.18 → 11880.30] yeah.
[11880.30 → 11881.08] It's probably going to be a video.
[11881.12 → 11881.40] I was like,
[11881.46 → 11881.98] thank God.
[11881.98 → 11883.10] So Moo mins are real says,
[11883.16 → 11886.94] so are you suggesting that scraping for AI was good because they had to start somewhere?
[11887.00 → 11888.18] So incredibly unrelated.
[11888.80 → 11889.30] That is,
[11889.38 → 11890.02] that is such a
[11890.14 → 11891.10] it's literally not stealing.
[11891.26 → 11893.32] It's such a bad faith comparison.
[11893.66 → 11894.50] On so many levels.
[11894.60 → 11894.80] Now,
[11894.88 → 11895.66] hold on though,
[11895.66 → 11897.16] because there are a lot of models.
[11897.30 → 11897.82] I'm bothered.
[11898.38 → 11898.76] Hold on.
[11898.84 → 11899.26] A lot of,
[11899.26 → 11902.48] there are a lot of models on these marketplaces that are not approved for commercial use.
[11902.66 → 11903.24] But his,
[11903.48 → 11903.90] however,
[11904.10 → 11906.36] we are explicitly in this case,
[11906.42 → 11911.30] we are explicitly talking about small scale student use,
[11911.44 → 11912.08] which,
[11912.76 → 11913.14] okay.
[11913.14 → 11914.28] Is it commercial?
[11914.72 → 11915.20] Yeah,
[11915.20 → 11918.60] but there are degrees of commercial use and there are,
[11918.70 → 11920.02] there's,
[11920.08 → 11921.26] there's nuance guys.
[11921.26 → 11921.40] Well,
[11921.46 → 11923.82] are the models that he's using with that license?
[11923.96 → 11924.80] Legitimately don't know.
[11924.94 → 11925.24] Okay.
[11925.36 → 11926.12] Kind of don't care.
[11926.44 → 11926.66] Yeah.
[11926.66 → 11927.32] To be honest with you.
[11927.32 → 11927.84] I don't really either,
[11927.84 → 11929.42] but they might also just not be.
[11929.58 → 11930.80] They also might just not be.
[11930.96 → 11931.56] I agree.
[11931.68 → 11932.96] There are a bunch of models that are like that.
[11933.02 → 11934.80] There are also a bunch of models that just don't care at all.
[11934.92 → 11936.64] And look over time,
[11936.64 → 11940.52] if he scales this thing up and all of a sudden he's like selling online and selling,
[11940.62 → 11940.76] you know,
[11940.82 → 11941.52] thousands of,
[11941.52 → 11941.84] of,
[11941.86 → 11942.88] of gadgets a week,
[11943.00 → 11944.48] he's going to need to make sure he's playing by the rules.
[11944.52 → 11946.54] Then he's going to need to make sure that he's playing by the rules.
[11946.54 → 11947.78] But when we're talking about,
[11947.96 → 11948.20] you know,
[11948.24 → 11951.64] a company like open AI or perplexity companies that,
[11951.80 → 11951.92] you know,
[11951.92 → 11955.24] have millions upon millions or billions of dollars of seed funding guys,
[11955.24 → 11956.92] we're talking about a totally different thing.
[11956.92 → 11959.40] We're not talking about a kid in their basement,
[11959.40 → 11963.14] printing 3d printed models and taking them to school and selling them for $4,
[11963.60 → 11964.14] right?
[11964.18 → 11967.74] Like we've context does matter.
[11968.48 → 11973.42] And I know that's a really hard concept for people,
[11973.62 → 11975.92] but it does matter.
[11975.92 → 11977.10] It does matter a lot.
[11977.10 → 11979.26] And the world is not black and white.
[11982.20 → 11983.10] All right.
[11986.94 → 11987.38] Uh,
[11987.50 → 11987.88] Oh yeah.
[11988.04 → 11988.36] Um,
[11988.36 → 11988.70] you know what?
[11988.70 → 11992.50] I don't really think that talking about the podcast I was on matters that much,
[11992.50 → 11995.76] but what is an interesting conversation?
[11995.76 → 11997.08] Um,
[11997.24 → 11998.16] I was,
[11998.24 → 11999.72] I was on like a
[11999.72 → 12000.38] an interview.
[12001.72 → 12002.16] Um,
[12003.22 → 12003.68] hold on.
[12004.06 → 12005.12] Let's see if I can find it.
[12006.42 → 12006.82] Yeah.
[12006.98 → 12007.26] Yeah.
[12007.26 → 12007.72] There we go.
[12007.98 → 12008.26] I,
[12008.32 → 12009.32] I did an interview with,
[12009.32 → 12009.50] uh,
[12009.50 → 12010.74] John Shay and,
[12010.80 → 12011.30] um,
[12013.24 → 12014.58] there was not the podcast.
[12014.78 → 12015.02] Yeah,
[12015.06 → 12015.42] this is it.
[12015.58 → 12015.78] Oh,
[12015.78 → 12016.04] okay.
[12016.18 → 12016.34] Yeah.
[12016.36 → 12017.60] And quite a few,
[12018.48 → 12027.36] quite a few people were very confused and some very upset by this.
[12027.74 → 12028.18] Wait,
[12028.22 → 12029.36] they were upset by it.
[12029.44 → 12029.70] Yeah.
[12029.80 → 12030.92] I can understand being confused.
[12031.00 → 12032.06] I don't understand being upset.
[12032.50 → 12032.94] Yeah.
[12033.00 → 12035.08] So YouTube has a new feature.
[12035.26 → 12035.44] Yeah.
[12035.44 → 12035.84] It's cool.
[12035.84 → 12037.90] That allows a channel to,
[12037.90 → 12038.72] uh,
[12038.84 → 12041.76] collaborate with another channel.
[12041.84 → 12042.22] Yeah.
[12042.22 → 12042.70] It's like awesome.
[12042.76 → 12043.64] Like through the platform.
[12043.72 → 12043.80] Well,
[12043.82 → 12044.06] hold on,
[12044.10 → 12044.34] hold on.
[12044.36 → 12044.72] Cause there's,
[12044.78 → 12045.96] there's alternate perspectives here.
[12046.52 → 12047.00] Um,
[12047.10 → 12055.36] to collaborate through the platform and publish a video to the subscriber feed of the channel
[12055.36 → 12056.80] that they collaborated with.
[12057.70 → 12058.14] Oh,
[12058.62 → 12059.10] yeah.
[12059.76 → 12060.64] That's why they're upset.
[12060.74 → 12061.50] I didn't know it did that.
[12061.60 → 12064.52] So that's where things get a little bit interesting.
[12064.52 → 12065.58] Is there a way for me to,
[12065.70 → 12067.60] is there a way for me to search?
[12068.08 → 12068.46] Can I,
[12068.58 → 12070.64] can I find all the comments that I know?
[12070.82 → 12072.48] I'm personally still okay with that,
[12072.54 → 12074.42] but I also understand why that would bother people.
[12074.58 → 12075.10] That's irritating.
[12075.10 → 12075.92] This is going to be,
[12076.06 → 12079.42] this is going to be a pretty hard thing for me to find here then,
[12079.42 → 12080.64] because I,
[12080.64 → 12085.02] I ran into someone that was like very upset about this feature.
[12085.02 → 12087.22] And I just legitimately was like,
[12087.30 → 12093.54] I would like to know more about your perspective because you have extremely strong feelings about this.
[12093.54 → 12095.60] And I don't really,
[12095.78 → 12096.14] uh,
[12096.14 → 12097.50] I don't really get it.
[12097.60 → 12098.04] Um,
[12098.36 → 12101.52] I'm going to see if I can find it because they,
[12101.64 → 12101.96] they,
[12102.32 → 12105.96] in some ways kind of raised an interesting point,
[12105.96 → 12107.72] but in other ways I think,
[12107.92 → 12108.34] um,
[12108.96 → 12112.70] are maybe not necessarily considering the
[12112.78 → 12113.28] the
[12113.28 → 12114.12] the shades of gray,
[12114.12 → 12114.84] I guess.
[12114.84 → 12115.78] So on the one hand,
[12115.88 → 12118.00] their black and white point that I can,
[12118.16 → 12121.68] that I can agree with is that I didn't subscribe to this channel.
[12121.68 → 12123.46] Get the f**k out of my feet.
[12123.84 → 12124.12] Yeah,
[12124.12 → 12124.74] I understand that.
[12125.82 → 12126.18] Fair.
[12127.44 → 12127.80] Valid.
[12128.20 → 12128.44] Oh,
[12128.54 → 12128.72] good.
[12128.76 → 12129.34] I found the comment.
[12129.50 → 12129.90] It would just,
[12129.96 → 12131.26] it would just be kind of cool if there's,
[12131.36 → 12132.60] when you go to your subscription feed,
[12132.60 → 12133.64] if there was a
[12133.64 → 12133.82] a
[12133.82 → 12133.92] a
[12133.92 → 12133.94] a
[12133.94 → 12138.06] a checkbox option thing to like no longer show collaboration.
[12138.22 → 12138.94] So here's buddy's comment.
[12139.32 → 12139.88] I hate,
[12140.06 → 12140.26] hate,
[12140.58 → 12144.24] hate the collab feature on YouTube and nine out of 10.
[12144.32 → 12146.84] I will not watch the video out of spite for this feature.
[12147.04 → 12150.36] We should not be getting videos from a creator and our subscribe feed from people.
[12150.46 → 12153.36] We are not subscribed to with that said,
[12153.80 → 12154.74] I don't know this podcast,
[12154.84 → 12157.22] but I am interested in Linus getting interviewed because it happens so seldomly.
[12157.26 → 12157.40] I mean,
[12157.40 → 12159.54] he's not afraid to say whatever the f**k he wants on his own channel,
[12159.62 → 12161.50] especially when any who back to the show.
[12161.50 → 12162.78] So I said,
[12162.86 → 12164.72] this seems like a super weird hill to die on.
[12164.78 → 12166.58] I'm interested to understand more about your stance.
[12166.74 → 12168.24] You subscribed to a creator,
[12168.68 → 12168.84] me,
[12168.92 → 12169.86] I assume in this case,
[12169.88 → 12172.28] and YouTube made a feature that notifies you when I'm in a video.
[12172.58 → 12174.24] I honestly don't see the problem with it.
[12174.30 → 12174.96] Can you help me out?
[12175.14 → 12175.24] Okay.
[12175.34 → 12175.84] So here's how,
[12175.94 → 12177.06] how open of you.
[12177.46 → 12177.72] Very,
[12177.82 → 12178.06] very,
[12178.16 → 12178.70] very nice.
[12179.14 → 12179.30] Well,
[12179.38 → 12179.56] no,
[12179.60 → 12179.82] I just,
[12179.94 → 12181.06] very reasonable comment,
[12181.22 → 12181.44] sir.
[12182.24 → 12183.64] I'm not being sarcastic.
[12183.82 → 12185.12] I did call him super weird.
[12186.94 → 12187.74] I'm still me.
[12187.74 → 12188.78] Did you say he was super weird?
[12188.80 → 12190.28] I said it's a super weird hill.
[12190.64 → 12190.94] Yeah.
[12190.94 → 12191.74] But I mean,
[12191.82 → 12192.78] he's dying on it.
[12192.92 → 12195.84] So I think the implication was clear.
[12197.06 → 12199.16] I think you're being super weird about this.
[12199.20 → 12200.14] It's kind of what I was saying,
[12200.22 → 12201.20] but I genuinely,
[12201.70 → 12202.40] genuinely,
[12202.72 → 12205.28] it felt like you were genuinely open to see their perspective.
[12205.28 → 12205.44] Well,
[12205.50 → 12206.22] I didn't think,
[12206.36 → 12208.40] I didn't think he was coming at it in bad faith.
[12208.60 → 12208.76] Yeah.
[12208.98 → 12210.96] I could tell he was legitimately upset.
[12211.12 → 12211.32] Yeah.
[12211.38 → 12217.18] That he wasn't making like assumptions or sweeping generalizations as far as I could tell.
[12217.36 → 12217.54] Yeah.
[12217.54 → 12218.42] So here's what he said.
[12218.52 → 12218.78] Okay.
[12219.78 → 12222.96] The example that started this collab feature was Mark Robert and Mr. Beast.
[12223.06 → 12223.62] And that is,
[12223.70 → 12224.60] that is fair enough.
[12224.64 → 12226.88] I think they were the first ones to get access to this feature.
[12226.98 → 12228.24] I think they launched it with the
[12228.24 → 12228.68] um,
[12229.18 → 12231.34] clean up the ocean collab earlier this year.
[12231.34 → 12231.36] Sure.
[12231.52 → 12231.72] Yeah.
[12231.72 → 12233.12] I don't quote me on that though.
[12233.16 → 12234.62] But I believe they have used it.
[12235.08 → 12236.72] I have a problem with Mr. Beast and his practices.
[12236.92 → 12240.80] Mr. Beast has since been shoved down my throat multiple times because he collabs with creators.
[12240.80 → 12241.52] I love watching,
[12241.64 → 12244.50] but I don't want to watch a Mr. Beast video.
[12244.70 → 12246.54] I specifically have him blocked for a reason.
[12246.70 → 12250.56] I shouldn't be forced to see his face or videos in my subscriber feed.
[12250.74 → 12251.46] You have him blocked.
[12251.62 → 12251.76] Yeah,
[12251.80 → 12252.54] it shouldn't show.
[12252.72 → 12257.34] And that is why I wanted to know more because I could tell we were going somewhere with this.
[12257.34 → 12257.60] Yeah.
[12257.60 → 12257.86] Yeah.
[12257.86 → 12260.44] And I agree a hundred percent.
[12261.06 → 12262.70] YouTube needs to fix this.
[12262.82 → 12262.94] Yeah.
[12262.96 → 12264.34] That seems simple to fix.
[12264.38 → 12266.08] It's one thing to,
[12266.26 → 12271.40] to feed me a video of a person that I subscribe to,
[12271.48 → 12272.78] even if they're on someone else's channel.
[12272.90 → 12273.12] Yeah.
[12273.30 → 12275.90] It is an entirely other thing.
[12276.14 → 12278.30] If I have explicitly said,
[12278.38 → 12280.84] do not show me the collaboration.
[12280.84 → 12282.22] That seems so simple to fix though.
[12282.32 → 12282.46] Well,
[12282.46 → 12283.72] they probably just didn't think of it.
[12283.92 → 12284.08] And we,
[12284.40 → 12285.26] and it just needs to,
[12285.30 → 12285.42] yeah,
[12285.48 → 12286.42] be properly communicated.
[12286.64 → 12287.40] They probably just didn't think of it.
[12287.40 → 12290.48] Every slow machine needs to eventually turn out the fix and it'll happen.
[12290.48 → 12290.84] I'm sure.
[12291.08 → 12291.46] Um,
[12291.96 → 12293.70] I've been dying on this hill for the months.
[12293.80 → 12294.80] This feature has existed.
[12294.80 → 12295.72] It's a long death.
[12296.10 → 12296.44] Um,
[12296.48 → 12299.78] I'm pretty sure I've said it in your comment section a few times in the WAN comment section.
[12299.78 → 12300.66] If you happen to mention it,
[12300.72 → 12301.52] I didn't see it before.
[12301.66 → 12302.10] Sorry,
[12302.24 → 12304.06] J Ceres 187.
[12304.26 → 12306.02] Thanks for taking the time to recognize it.
[12306.60 → 12307.00] Um,
[12307.64 → 12308.54] I also,
[12308.54 → 12313.68] I think it should be your or the collaborators' responsibility to show me slash advertise this content.
[12314.08 → 12316.22] Put a post up on your socials or on the YouTube feed.
[12316.22 → 12316.44] Hey,
[12316.46 → 12317.52] I made this thing with this person.
[12317.62 → 12318.66] Check it out or don't.
[12318.80 → 12322.56] So here's where I'm going to kind of go counterpoint J Ceres.
[12323.04 → 12324.58] I wish I had that power.
[12325.04 → 12326.04] I don't.
[12326.04 → 12333.08] If I post something on like the Linus Tech Tips community tab, or if I post a short or something,
[12333.42 → 12346.64] if it doesn't resonate strongly with the audience, especially with how sensitive algorithmically YouTube has been lately to things just being either mega bangers or absolute flops,
[12346.64 → 12349.40] it will have like zero reach.
[12350.12 → 12351.52] You won't see it.
[12352.30 → 12362.10] And so YouTube took away my power to, to promote these things myself a really long time ago, algorithmically.
[12362.10 → 12366.74] So what they're doing is they're, they're giving me back the scraps.
[12367.16 → 12376.14] They're giving me the ability, or they're giving another creator the ability to, to properly cross-pollinate in a way that we haven't had for a long time.
[12376.14 → 12377.86] And I totally get it.
[12377.98 → 12385.42] If you have a channel blocked, like if you had this John guy, you know, if you hate his channel or something, or in your case, it was Mr. Beast.
[12385.50 → 12386.02] It wasn't Johnny.
[12386.08 → 12390.36] I can't see anything to hate about John here, but, but in your case, it was Mr. Beast.
[12390.42 → 12394.08] If you have a channel explicitly blocked that you have a do not show flag on.
[12394.08 → 12394.64] You should never see it.
[12394.68 → 12395.88] You should never see it.
[12395.94 → 12397.30] I agree with you a hundred percent.
[12397.40 → 12398.86] That's something YouTube needs to fix.
[12398.86 → 12403.20] But your suggestion that I just sort of promote things myself.
[12403.80 → 12405.20] I wish I could.
[12405.50 → 12406.66] I hate that.
[12406.70 → 12414.30] I can't, that I can't publish something and, and be trusted to, to not spam my viewers with stuff.
[12414.30 → 12423.38] They don't want to see to, to actually have the power to push a notification to the people who click subscribe and just let them unsubscribe if they, if they don't want to see it.
[12423.38 → 12441.78] But YouTube determined a long time ago that for their business interests, which are maximizing watch time and maximizing ad and premium revenue, it was better for them to just, because they knew that users were just going to be too lazy to unsubscribe to a channel they didn't want to hear from.
[12441.92 → 12444.06] And they were just going to turn off YouTube notifications.
[12444.06 → 12445.04] That's where it came from.
[12445.04 → 12455.62] That's what this all goes back to is users instead of unsubscribing from stuff they don't want to see, they would just turn off notifications and YouTube doesn't want that.
[12456.22 → 12462.00] So they determined it was better for them to decide how often to give you a notification from my channel.
[12462.08 → 12464.24] They took that power away from me long time ago.
[12466.50 → 12469.50] So yeah, last thing I said was, okay, hey, thanks for elaborating.
[12469.58 → 12474.42] I still think it's a little overkill to want to remove a feature from the platform because there's one specific creator you're trying to avoid.
[12475.04 → 12480.66] I also agree with your general sentiment that as a viewer, you should be able to control the content that is fed to you.
[12481.46 → 12487.18] The part I don't agree with is that this is any worse than basically anything else YouTube has done algorithm-wise over the last five to ten years.
[12487.62 → 12494.02] The short shelf being in my way all the time or the utterly broken search that's full of stuff I've already watched and stuff I'm not looking for are so much worse IMO.
[12495.06 → 12496.24] Anyway, look at that.
[12496.94 → 12500.02] Look at that, a respectful interaction on the internet.
[12500.16 → 12501.40] We should have it bronzed.
[12501.40 → 12508.08] I learned something and hopefully JS learned something as well.
[12508.82 → 12512.04] I was scrolling through the YouTube's while you were talking about that.
[12512.14 → 12516.82] I just have the account that's logged in for the WAN show here.
[12517.20 → 12522.24] I just noticed something random in the recommendations, which was a 13-year-old NVIDIA video,
[12522.24 → 12529.50] a four-year-old Delta Highlights video, a 15-year-old white 546 video,
[12531.38 → 12534.76] 13 days, two months, 12-year-old video.
[12535.32 → 12535.88] Scroll down more.
[12535.98 → 12537.74] Eight years ago, 16 years ago.
[12537.98 → 12538.70] What's happening?
[12539.98 → 12543.04] Why is this account recommended just like the oldest stuff ever?
[12543.04 → 12544.70] Maybe it just knows you're old.
[12544.78 → 12548.68] Maybe this is the equivalent of Spotify's Your Listener Age feature.
[12548.72 → 12550.92] I'll go seems to have changed in the last few days.
[12551.02 → 12552.92] I've noticed my feed get really weird again.
[12553.18 → 12558.06] It did somehow pick up that I would want to see the fact...
[12558.06 → 12558.90] I am Gabe Newell?
[12559.22 → 12559.94] Oh, no.
[12560.18 → 12562.06] That I would want to see this one.
[12562.78 → 12564.44] Sky Bolivian delayed at 2026.
[12564.44 → 12570.76] So they know that about me somehow, even though it's not even like really my...
[12570.76 → 12572.46] I guess it sort of is my account, but like...
[12572.46 → 12573.16] You search for stuff sometimes.
[12573.26 → 12574.32] But I don't watch it.
[12574.34 → 12575.10] It's just on WAN show.
[12575.24 → 12580.72] No, but you search for stuff in this Chrome profile that is related to what we talk about on WAN.
[12580.98 → 12581.38] So you definitely...
[12581.38 → 12582.74] So maybe we talked about Sky Bolivian.
[12582.82 → 12583.28] We definitely...
[12583.28 → 12583.72] We probably did.
[12583.90 → 12584.14] Luke.
[12584.30 → 12584.90] We probably did.
[12585.00 → 12585.34] Luke.
[12585.48 → 12585.86] We did.
[12586.34 → 12586.90] Thank you.
[12592.62 → 12593.38] It happened.
[12594.44 → 12596.30] Is that it for topics?
[12597.16 → 12598.10] Yeah, I think so.
[12598.16 → 12600.60] Anyway, you can go check out the interview if you want.
[12602.52 → 12607.50] A lot of ground has been trod before on the WAN show, but it's a more concise version of a lot of it.
[12607.54 → 12609.90] You don't have to watch like a thousand hours of WAN show.
[12610.10 → 12611.60] You could just watch the one interview.
[12611.82 → 12613.08] And he was really nice.
[12613.18 → 12614.36] Very accommodating host.
[12615.44 → 12616.48] Yeah, super cool.
[12616.58 → 12618.16] I met him for the first time at Vid Summit.
[12618.16 → 12619.16] That was where we...
[12619.16 → 12620.66] It was actually...
[12620.66 → 12623.38] I saw a couple complaints on his channel.
[12623.38 → 12627.52] It's amazing how spoiled people can get because his channel generally looks really great.
[12628.06 → 12635.60] So I saw some complaints about his set, and it's like, bro, they managed to make it look that good in a conference room.
[12636.04 → 12636.94] I was like...
[12636.94 → 12642.74] I was marvelling at what he and his team pulled off and like their amazing attention to detail.
[12642.74 → 12645.84] And meanwhile, people are like complaining about it.
[12646.84 → 12648.02] Yeah, I was like...
[12648.02 → 12649.44] I was like, great job, you guys.
[12649.96 → 12650.64] This looks...
[12650.64 → 12651.50] This looks swell.
[12651.62 → 12652.36] Why were they complaining?
[12652.44 → 12654.60] This was just in like an ugly...
[12654.60 → 12657.32] You know how every conference room has to be like tan and brown?
[12657.42 → 12657.58] Yeah.
[12657.58 → 12658.20] And just...
[12658.20 → 12660.50] Yeah, we were just in like an ugly tan brown conference.
[12660.50 → 12663.54] They brought in a rug to Hugh it up a little bit.
[12663.60 → 12664.52] Brought in some plants.
[12664.60 → 12665.28] They got the lighting.
[12665.58 → 12666.12] I don't know.
[12666.14 → 12667.02] I thought they did a great job.
[12667.02 → 12667.78] So...
[12667.78 → 12669.42] I didn't think it was in a studio.
[12669.74 → 12671.26] I didn't know where you were, but I...
[12671.26 → 12673.28] Yeah, I mean, I picked up the vibe pretty quick.
[12673.30 → 12674.84] We were in a horrible meeting room at a hotel.
[12675.04 → 12675.26] Yeah.
[12675.32 → 12676.12] Or in a conference centre.
[12676.46 → 12677.64] I didn't see much of it.
[12677.76 → 12678.42] Great job.
[12678.82 → 12679.52] Great job.
[12681.84 → 12682.80] All right, Dan.
[12683.18 → 12684.20] I think it's time.
[12684.48 → 12688.80] It's when after dark, except it's the afternoon light out there.
[12688.80 → 12690.12] I don't know how to deal with this.
[12690.18 → 12690.94] He was ahead of us.
[12690.98 → 12692.10] I don't know how to deal with this.
[12692.14 → 12692.76] Yeah, it's a little weird.
[12694.36 → 12695.88] There are other connotations.
[12695.88 → 12697.66] Yeah, we don't go outside.
[12698.94 → 12699.16] Yeah.
[12702.02 → 12703.18] How about some merch messages?
[12703.56 → 12703.76] Yes.
[12703.80 → 12704.36] I'd love that.
[12704.56 → 12705.34] One dowie.
[12705.84 → 12709.82] First time catching a show between work and being Sabbath observant.
[12710.16 → 12711.98] In my community, Sundown Friday...
[12711.98 → 12712.26] Hold on.
[12712.56 → 12713.46] Wait, I'm a little confused.
[12713.56 → 12714.40] Can we slow down for a second?
[12714.46 → 12716.22] I thought you're allowed to recreate...
[12716.22 → 12717.62] Wait, are you not allowed to use computers?
[12719.08 → 12720.70] Well, it's not Friday Sundown yet.
[12721.44 → 12721.96] No, no, I know.
[12722.04 → 12723.50] But just like the Sabbath in general.
[12723.62 → 12724.38] I don't know the rules.
[12724.72 → 12725.18] No work.
[12725.18 → 12727.38] Yeah, but is watching a podcast work?
[12727.42 → 12728.90] Turning on a light is work.
[12728.96 → 12730.24] Is he calling us work?
[12731.94 → 12732.94] No, no, I know.
[12733.18 → 12733.50] It's rude.
[12734.44 → 12735.04] Right, though?
[12735.06 → 12735.36] It's rude.
[12736.10 → 12736.38] Okay.
[12736.50 → 12737.36] Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12737.42 → 12737.84] Tell me this.
[12737.90 → 12738.28] Tell me this.
[12738.34 → 12738.52] Okay.
[12738.92 → 12739.18] Okay.
[12740.34 → 12742.38] Again, this is coming from a place of complete ignorance.
[12742.46 → 12743.58] I have no idea how the rules work.
[12743.64 → 12746.18] All I know is that sometimes my B&H orders wouldn't ship on time.
[12746.60 → 12747.82] That's literally all I know.
[12748.64 → 12749.00] So...
[12749.00 → 12750.42] Don't they have a wire for that?
[12750.42 → 12751.74] But if I...
[12751.74 → 12757.92] If you created a script that would like...
[12757.92 → 12760.18] That would turn on your TV tomorrow...
[12760.18 → 12761.82] No, what?
[12761.96 → 12762.76] I'm just asking.
[12762.78 → 12764.64] This is a whole line of technology.
[12764.88 → 12766.16] This is a whole thing we can get into.
[12766.20 → 12766.48] Really?
[12767.20 → 12767.88] Shut up.
[12768.14 → 12768.90] Uh...
[12768.90 → 12775.16] So I could push a button today on Friday, and then it could run a script that has a time
[12775.16 → 12782.26] delay to turn on the WAN show tomorrow, and then we'll turn it off when it's over.
[12782.44 → 12783.84] Would that count?
[12785.00 → 12786.56] I think that's a thing.
[12786.96 → 12787.96] Like, I'm pretty...
[12787.96 → 12794.14] Yeah, I've heard of ovens that will turn on to preheat at a scheduled time, and then...
[12794.14 → 12794.62] So you can have dinner?
[12795.16 → 12796.64] You can do stuff like that.
[12797.04 → 12797.94] Like, it's...
[12797.94 → 12798.88] You do a crock part?
[12799.00 → 12800.44] You start it in the morning?
[12800.88 → 12801.24] Yeah.
[12801.84 → 12807.48] There are special elevators that stop on every floor...
[12807.48 → 12807.72] Yep.
[12807.84 → 12809.54] So that you don't have to press a button.
[12809.56 → 12811.10] Yeah, you're not interacting with it.
[12811.14 → 12814.40] It just stops, opens the door for a certain period of time, and then keeps going.
[12815.78 → 12816.30] Um...
[12818.44 → 12819.00] Yeah.
[12821.22 → 12822.06] There's, like...
[12822.06 → 12823.30] There's a lot of...
[12823.30 → 12823.52] Ooh.
[12823.96 → 12825.48] Technological workarounds.
[12827.94 → 12828.40] Huh.
[12831.10 → 12831.50] Okay.
[12833.00 → 12833.44] Interesting.
[12834.36 → 12835.74] It's a whole industry, apparently.
[12836.98 → 12837.42] Wow.
[12838.12 → 12839.48] This kind of reminds me of the, uh...
[12839.48 → 12842.26] Apparently, electrical timers are, like, a huge deal for this.
[12843.40 → 12844.00] Uh...
[12844.00 → 12847.50] This kind of reminds me of the, uh...
[12847.50 → 12849.94] I think they're called halal mortgages?
[12851.22 → 12856.02] I learned about this a while ago, because you're not allowed to have a loan.
[12856.38 → 12856.90] Or, no.
[12857.12 → 12860.60] You're not allowed to pay or receive interest in Islam.
[12861.10 → 12867.60] So, instead of a loan, it's an asset-backed partnership, or a lease-to-own agreement.
[12867.60 → 12871.56] Apparently, they cost, like, way more.
[12872.46 → 12872.86] Nice.
[12873.26 → 12873.56] Yeah.
[12875.72 → 12876.28] Uh...
[12876.28 → 12876.76] Anyway...
[12876.76 → 12880.02] I just love the name of this, but one of them is called a Shaban.
[12880.52 → 12881.52] Uh...
[12881.52 → 12883.68] Uh...
[12883.68 → 12893.84] It's a light bulb that fits, like, any lamp and can be turned on and off on Shabbat.
[12894.28 → 12894.80] Uh...
[12894.80 → 12901.54] Apparently, a toggle on the LED bulb allows users to make it go dark by concealing LED diodes
[12901.54 → 12902.74] that actually stay on.
[12903.20 → 12907.44] Unlike other Shabbat-friendly lamps on the market, the Shaban fits any socket.
[12907.56 → 12908.78] It can be used in a regular lamp.
[12908.78 → 12913.94] It's probably my least profitable item, but people love this product, says Mordecai.
[12915.80 → 12917.40] You can use it during the week.
[12917.50 → 12921.18] You don't have to have a clunky lamp you have to take out, especially for Shabby.
[12921.64 → 12925.02] Yeah, then there's, like, the Shabbat mode ovens.
[12925.66 → 12926.04] Huh.
[12926.68 → 12927.10] Alright.
[12927.28 → 12927.54] Wow.
[12928.60 → 12929.22] What a...
[12929.22 → 12929.90] What a...
[12929.90 → 12932.98] What a technology branch of technology.
[12932.98 → 12937.42] I've also heard people accidentally setting it into the wrong mode, and then they can't
[12937.42 → 12938.66] use their oven all weekend.
[12939.16 → 12940.62] So you can't use it accidentally.
[12941.96 → 12943.20] Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, yeah.
[12943.26 → 12947.36] Like, oh, you're starting to set it to cleaning mode, and now it's just broken.
[12947.42 → 12950.50] Now I want to learn more about these rules, right?
[12950.68 → 12950.98] Like, I...
[12950.98 → 12951.36] It's pretty cool.
[12951.48 → 12951.92] It's pretty cool.
[12951.92 → 12952.50] Okay, okay.
[12952.74 → 12956.78] So my OMA had a lamp that didn't have, like, a switch.
[12956.82 → 12958.12] It was, like, the touch to dim.
[12958.50 → 12958.98] Remember those?
[12959.00 → 12959.68] Those were so cool.
[12959.76 → 12960.94] How are those not in fashion anymore?
[12961.06 → 12961.12] Yeah, yeah.
[12961.12 → 12962.30] Anyway, the point is...
[12962.30 → 12963.18] My parents still have one.
[12963.22 → 12964.56] Yeah, it was, like, a touch to dim.
[12965.38 → 12966.34] Is that a switch?
[12966.86 → 12967.64] Does that count?
[12967.86 → 12969.42] What if you accidentally bump it?
[12970.70 → 12970.92] Oh.
[12971.72 → 12972.38] Well, I don't know.
[12972.42 → 12972.88] I don't know.
[12972.96 → 12973.68] I literally...
[12973.68 → 12974.70] I don't know.
[12975.08 → 12975.68] I don't know.
[12975.68 → 12976.40] Does that...
[12976.40 → 12976.64] Are you...
[12976.64 → 12977.70] What about voice control?
[12978.36 → 12979.42] Like, is that a thing?
[12981.12 → 12982.14] Speaking is work.
[12983.02 → 12984.72] But then would that mean that you can't speak ever?
[12985.86 → 12988.24] I'd say yes, because you still operate...
[12988.24 → 12988.44] No.
[12989.10 → 12990.58] This is not your debate, guys.
[12990.62 → 12991.62] I'm not debating anything.
[12991.70 → 12992.56] I'm asking questions.
[12992.74 → 12992.96] Yeah.
[12993.14 → 12993.92] Chill, master of none.
[12993.94 → 12994.32] It's okay.
[12994.74 → 12995.40] It's okay.
[12995.88 → 12996.48] Clap on.
[12996.48 → 12997.38] I don't know.
[12997.38 → 13001.62] Tim says I'd say yes, because you still operate the device.
[13001.76 → 13005.66] Yeah, because you're not operating the elevator by just getting on it.
[13005.68 → 13006.26] And getting off.
[13006.34 → 13006.66] Right.
[13006.74 → 13008.62] You're not instructing it to do anything.
[13008.82 → 13009.16] Right.
[13010.02 → 13011.20] Closing a blind...
[13011.20 → 13015.30] Like, closing the shutters on your LED bulb, I guess.
[13016.20 → 13016.52] Yeah.
[13016.52 → 13016.74] Right?
[13016.76 → 13018.50] That's why they don't turn on or off.
[13018.56 → 13019.86] You're just kind of, like, blocking the light.
[13019.86 → 13021.30] You're affecting the result.
[13021.58 → 13021.98] Uh-huh.
[13022.10 → 13025.48] But you're not actually commanding the device to do something different, I guess.
[13026.14 → 13026.54] Fascinating.
[13029.04 → 13029.44] Anyway.
[13029.90 → 13030.14] Yeah.
[13030.26 → 13034.44] The question is, have you ever done a full tech detox?
[13034.90 → 13035.26] Hold on.
[13035.32 → 13035.62] Hold on.
[13035.68 → 13037.34] Lucky Drive says, my girlfriend is Jewish.
[13037.46 → 13039.70] If you bump into it, it doesn't count as it wasn't intended.
[13039.78 → 13042.28] If it's genuinely not intended, I think that makes a lot of sense.
[13042.36 → 13043.82] But are you allowed to turn it back off?
[13047.80 → 13048.44] I don't know.
[13048.52 → 13048.98] I don't know.
[13049.92 → 13050.28] I don't know.
[13050.36 → 13050.56] Okay.
[13050.66 → 13050.90] All right.
[13050.92 → 13051.12] All right.
[13051.14 → 13051.34] All right.
[13051.36 → 13051.56] Okay.
[13051.64 → 13052.08] Sorry, Dan.
[13052.14 → 13052.40] Go ahead.
[13052.40 → 13054.30] Have you ever done a full tech...
[13054.30 → 13056.18] No, we haven't even started this merch message.
[13056.56 → 13056.92] No.
[13057.16 → 13058.02] I didn't even...
[13058.02 → 13059.32] I didn't get halfway through it.
[13059.40 → 13059.64] Wow.
[13059.72 → 13059.98] Okay.
[13060.10 → 13060.24] Cool.
[13060.24 → 13062.76] Have you ever done a full tech detox?
[13063.12 → 13064.08] I have, unintentionally.
[13064.08 → 13065.10] Um, no.
[13066.38 → 13066.82] No.
[13066.96 → 13068.64] I, uh...
[13068.64 → 13070.32] I like tech.
[13071.76 → 13073.60] I should probably try it.
[13073.90 → 13077.34] How long would it have to be to truly be a detox?
[13078.68 → 13079.34] I don't know.
[13079.38 → 13080.22] It's 30 minutes?
[13080.22 → 13082.54] I'm already shaking.
[13084.42 → 13088.38] I think if it's less than a week, you haven't even really, like, tried.
[13089.72 → 13090.08] Yeah.
[13090.18 → 13091.60] My biggest problem with this stuff is work.
[13092.00 → 13095.84] Uh, Emma proposed, like, we should pick a day on a weekend where we don't do any...
[13095.84 → 13097.22] Oh, got excited there.
[13098.36 → 13098.60] Oh.
[13099.14 → 13106.20] Uh, Emma suggested that we do a day on the weekend where we don't use any electronics.
[13106.20 → 13107.86] And I was like, yeah, I mean, that's neat.
[13108.08 → 13111.70] But if something happens, I, like, need to be able to be in contact.
[13111.70 → 13115.32] That is such an asshole way to respond to someone's suggestion.
[13115.60 → 13116.28] That's neat.
[13116.30 → 13117.78] It is actually, like, a cool idea.
[13117.84 → 13118.56] I just can't do it.
[13118.56 → 13119.08] It is a cool idea.
[13119.26 → 13120.10] I, like, it's...
[13120.10 → 13121.86] I would genuinely like to.
[13122.24 → 13126.36] And I suggested we do, like, severely limited or something.
[13127.16 → 13127.92] But, like...
[13127.92 → 13129.00] What would that even look like?
[13129.00 → 13129.80] A smartwatch.
[13129.88 → 13131.82] I don't think I can actually just...
[13131.82 → 13133.18] Um...
[13133.18 → 13138.32] I don't think I can actually just completely cold turkey it because of work stuff.
[13139.32 → 13147.86] And, like, part of my big issue is that when I'm bored, what I would probably like to do is, like, just do some work stuff.
[13148.28 → 13149.72] Like, it's kind of my hobby.
[13150.48 → 13150.88] Yeah.
[13151.44 → 13151.92] So...
[13151.92 → 13152.74] That happens to me, too.
[13152.74 → 13156.04] Yeah, but, like, I think that's the point of digital detox.
[13156.06 → 13157.06] I can do something else, though.
[13157.08 → 13157.86] That's the point.
[13157.86 → 13159.40] Is that you're supposed to just not?
[13159.60 → 13160.94] I am certain I can do something else.
[13161.12 → 13161.42] Okay.
[13161.64 → 13162.26] Tell you what.
[13163.60 → 13164.00] 2026.
[13165.98 → 13166.72] Let's do it.
[13166.90 → 13167.32] Do what?
[13167.42 → 13168.56] Let's do a couple's weekend.
[13170.72 → 13171.46] No tech.
[13171.80 → 13172.84] That's going to be a problem.
[13173.10 → 13174.60] If neither of us can be contacted.
[13174.68 → 13175.14] Doesn't matter.
[13175.70 → 13176.34] Also, Yvonne.
[13176.42 → 13177.12] Don't forget Yvonne.
[13177.34 → 13178.02] Oh, God.
[13178.16 → 13178.74] Yeah, I know.
[13179.98 → 13184.64] I can probably set up enough, like, contact lines that things could get figured out.
[13184.68 → 13185.42] Or, hear me out.
[13185.48 → 13186.10] This is crazy.
[13186.10 → 13189.06] You could set a vacation responder on your email for the first time ever.
[13189.64 → 13190.10] I know.
[13190.26 → 13190.86] I know.
[13190.96 → 13191.98] But you could try it.
[13192.80 → 13194.10] You could try it.
[13195.62 → 13195.98] Never.
[13198.06 → 13200.92] Mostly really emergency stuff isn't going to be emailed, though.
[13200.94 → 13201.44] Let's do it.
[13201.52 → 13202.58] It'll be Slack and Teams.
[13202.62 → 13203.26] No, let's do it.
[13204.68 → 13205.38] Let's do it.
[13205.80 → 13206.48] One weekend?
[13206.70 → 13207.20] One weekend.
[13207.34 → 13208.06] I can do one weekend.
[13208.14 → 13208.88] We'll do one weekend.
[13208.94 → 13210.00] We can make one weekend work.
[13210.00 → 13212.36] I'm sending this to Yvonne, which means you know it will happen.
[13214.22 → 13215.42] Now it's not just words.
[13215.54 → 13216.22] Yvonne's involved.
[13216.38 → 13217.26] I can do one weekend.
[13218.70 → 13222.46] I've effectively had to do one weekend because I won't have service for the weekend and stuff.
[13222.46 → 13240.26] I'm actually still live, comma, but Luke and I made a pact just now that we are going to do a couple's digital detox for one weekend next year.
[13240.26 → 13246.22] So that means from midnight on Friday to midnight on Sunday night, no tech.
[13246.60 → 13248.62] I think it's WAN show ending.
[13249.96 → 13251.36] Yeah, I could get it.
[13251.40 → 13251.62] Well.
[13252.36 → 13254.58] Because Friday night's the weekend, in my opinion.
[13256.10 → 13256.50] Interesting.
[13256.70 → 13256.96] Okay.
[13257.34 → 13258.90] Well, we can debate that later.
[13258.98 → 13260.72] I don't want to get into a long text.
[13260.72 → 13260.90] Sure.
[13261.34 → 13261.82] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13261.82 → 13262.96] I could get behind that.
[13263.06 → 13263.72] I could get behind that.
[13263.78 → 13268.84] So we turn off WAN show, and then we touch no electronic switches and no screens.
[13268.84 → 13270.24] No electronic switches.
[13271.18 → 13272.98] I think we can turn lights on and stuff.
[13273.10 → 13274.64] I mean, is it technology or not?
[13274.84 → 13275.20] Okay.
[13275.38 → 13275.56] All right.
[13275.56 → 13275.98] You know what?
[13276.02 → 13276.30] No, it's.
[13276.38 → 13276.70] You know what?
[13276.80 → 13277.36] I'm down.
[13277.40 → 13278.58] We got to do candles and stuff.
[13278.86 → 13279.04] I'm down.
[13279.16 → 13280.70] They asked digital detox.
[13280.82 → 13281.98] So how about microchip?
[13282.42 → 13283.92] How about we draw the line at microchip?
[13284.88 → 13285.80] I'm thinking screen.
[13286.04 → 13286.50] A lot of.
[13286.60 → 13286.82] A lot of.
[13286.82 → 13286.84] A lot of.
[13286.84 → 13286.88] A lot of.
[13286.88 → 13287.46] A lot of.
[13287.46 → 13287.74] Modern.
[13288.40 → 13288.72] Yeah.
[13289.04 → 13290.02] Screen or microchip?
[13290.04 → 13291.72] A lot of modern lights have microchips in them.
[13291.76 → 13293.56] Your light switches are like.
[13294.38 → 13295.88] Our vehicles have microchips in them.
[13296.06 → 13297.88] You walk past them, and they turn on.
[13298.24 → 13298.64] Ah.
[13298.78 → 13299.06] Okay.
[13299.42 → 13299.58] Right.
[13299.58 → 13301.54] I mean, your main vehicle has a screen in it too.
[13301.66 → 13302.66] Am I not going to be able to drive?
[13302.86 → 13303.14] No.
[13303.34 → 13303.54] No.
[13303.80 → 13304.08] Stop.
[13304.30 → 13304.44] Okay.
[13304.52 → 13308.38] I think you're overthinking this a little bit, but you can't listen to the radio in your
[13308.38 → 13308.66] car.
[13309.38 → 13309.68] Really?
[13310.02 → 13310.58] I like that.
[13310.68 → 13311.34] No maps.
[13311.90 → 13312.22] No.
[13312.50 → 13313.06] I like that.
[13313.06 → 13313.80] I like that.
[13313.80 → 13313.82] I like that.
[13313.82 → 13314.40] I like that.
[13314.40 → 13315.18] No, no nothing.
[13315.18 → 13316.20] Can I have a paper map?
[13316.28 → 13317.20] I can have a paper map.
[13317.22 → 13317.50] Yes.
[13317.50 → 13317.78] Can I have a paper map?
[13317.90 → 13318.06] Yes.
[13318.06 → 13318.12] Yes.
[13318.12 → 13319.68] Can I print the paper map?
[13319.80 → 13319.98] Yeah.
[13320.60 → 13321.72] If you do it Friday.
[13322.30 → 13322.70] Okay.
[13322.94 → 13323.34] Interesting.
[13323.66 → 13324.02] Interesting.
[13324.30 → 13324.48] Yeah.
[13324.56 → 13325.66] You know, preheat the oven.
[13325.74 → 13326.44] You can use your oven.
[13326.68 → 13327.50] I don't care.
[13327.50 → 13330.50] You can't watch a podcast or listen to music.
[13330.50 → 13332.34] I think it's like modern services, effectively.
[13332.68 → 13333.98] Like, you can't use your phone at all.
[13334.02 → 13336.04] No entertainment from a digital device.
[13336.24 → 13338.34] No assistance from a digital device.
[13338.34 → 13339.12] That sort of thing.
[13339.12 → 13339.34] You can't use your TV at all.
[13339.44 → 13339.64] Yeah.
[13341.64 → 13343.84] Can't use something that's like a monitor.
[13343.92 → 13346.16] Can I read a book if it's on a Kindle?
[13346.54 → 13346.80] No.
[13346.92 → 13347.14] No.
[13347.38 → 13347.64] Okay.
[13347.68 → 13348.80] You have to read a paper book.
[13348.88 → 13349.44] No, no, it's good.
[13349.54 → 13350.12] I'm just checking.
[13350.36 → 13351.36] We want to find out.
[13351.56 → 13352.78] We're finding the lines.
[13352.82 → 13353.28] Where are the lines?
[13353.28 → 13354.42] What if I preloaded?
[13354.54 → 13355.08] What if I preload?
[13355.10 → 13355.28] Okay.
[13355.36 → 13355.92] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[13355.92 → 13358.20] You said that I'm allowed to preprint a map.
[13358.42 → 13358.68] Yes.
[13358.88 → 13363.18] What if I had a hundred Kindles and I preloaded a hundred pages on it?
[13363.18 → 13363.68] No, no, no.
[13363.70 → 13364.52] You have to print it.
[13364.60 → 13364.84] Okay.
[13364.96 → 13365.16] Okay.
[13365.16 → 13366.52] I have to print the book.
[13367.26 → 13368.56] Curse you, DRM.
[13369.18 → 13370.22] I won't be able to.
[13370.58 → 13372.12] There are lots of DRM-free books, actually.
[13372.34 → 13376.90] By the way, Lucky Drive 1984 says, if you accidentally bump into it and turn it on, you cannot turn
[13376.90 → 13377.86] it back off, unfortunately.
[13378.52 → 13379.14] Yeah, that sounds right.
[13379.16 → 13380.28] So I did get my answer on that.
[13380.70 → 13381.38] All right, Dan.
[13381.42 → 13381.90] What's next?
[13383.08 → 13384.04] Hey, LLD.
[13384.04 → 13387.62] Linus, you've talked a lot about inventory of your products, and I was curious.
[13387.84 → 13392.02] Why can't you just order a lot of it, store it in a warehouse till it sells out?
[13392.32 → 13393.74] Cheers from the Netherlands.
[13394.58 → 13395.76] Money, money, money, money!
[13396.24 → 13397.64] It's such an innocent question.
[13397.76 → 13398.40] I know, right?
[13398.80 → 13399.12] Money!
[13399.64 → 13400.16] Money, money, money!
[13400.16 → 13402.00] But it's a complaint that our...
[13402.00 → 13402.76] Money, money, money!
[13403.18 → 13403.70] Yeah.
[13403.96 → 13404.24] Money!
[13406.74 → 13409.02] As it turns out, I...
[13409.02 → 13410.00] He's losing it.
[13410.06 → 13411.64] ...do not have unlimited money.
[13412.02 → 13412.36] What?
[13412.56 → 13413.36] I know!
[13413.68 → 13414.50] I...
[13414.50 → 13416.38] We should do something to fix this.
[13416.42 → 13417.38] My illusion is shattered.
[13417.54 → 13418.36] Mine, too.
[13418.58 → 13420.62] If you had stock, you would have more money.
[13420.70 → 13421.10] I thought I did.
[13421.20 → 13421.56] It was all...
[13421.56 → 13421.94] It's catch-22.
[13422.22 → 13423.00] It was all digital.
[13423.34 → 13423.54] Yeah.
[13423.68 → 13424.02] Yeah, right.
[13424.04 → 13424.26] That's a good point.
[13424.78 → 13426.06] How am I getting...
[13426.06 → 13427.28] It's an infinite money glitch.
[13427.72 → 13430.40] The more stock I buy, the more money I have.
[13431.36 → 13431.92] So...
[13431.92 → 13433.02] You see this chicken?
[13433.22 → 13434.66] It's made of chicken.
[13434.66 → 13442.48] One of the biggest challenges, moving from a small business to a mid-sized business, and
[13442.48 → 13444.72] then beyond.
[13445.22 → 13448.96] One of the things that really scales in difficulty is managing your cash flow.
[13449.50 → 13451.20] Not your profitability.
[13452.10 → 13455.28] You can be a profitable business...
[13455.28 → 13456.10] And still be out of money.
[13456.10 → 13460.90] ...that goes out of business because you didn't correctly manage your cash flow.
[13460.90 → 13466.52] Because you ended up with warehouses full of inventory that are not turning fast enough,
[13466.66 → 13471.48] and you end up with more bills due than you have money left to pay them.
[13471.64 → 13478.12] All of a sudden, you fall behind on your payroll, which is the single most important bill that
[13478.12 → 13479.68] you need to pay every two weeks.
[13480.92 → 13481.94] And that's it.
[13482.50 → 13483.38] You're cooked.
[13483.74 → 13488.06] Because maybe you're in an industry where no amount of discounting...
[13488.06 → 13489.06] I don't know...
[13489.06 → 13494.94] Giant copper rods is going to make enough new infrastructure projects that more people
[13494.94 → 13495.52] are going to buy them.
[13495.72 → 13496.94] Like, I don't know what industry you're in.
[13496.98 → 13500.70] In some industries, you can just torch your inventory.
[13501.22 → 13505.50] Not literally light it on fire, but you can just go really aggressive on the pricing.
[13505.64 → 13506.66] You can move through a bunch of it.
[13506.86 → 13508.22] You can generate some cash flow.
[13508.60 → 13510.28] You get your payroll paid.
[13510.46 → 13510.80] You get...
[13510.80 → 13511.52] You know...
[13511.52 → 13513.22] Maybe you're a little behind on your taxes as well.
[13513.26 → 13514.22] You get that dealt with.
[13514.22 → 13517.04] You go a little more conservative on your reorder.
[13517.18 → 13520.04] And you can get your feet back under you, right?
[13521.80 → 13529.56] But especially a business that is scaling, that is growing, can run into trouble.
[13529.78 → 13532.84] Because it's easy to look at your sales, right?
[13532.98 → 13534.10] And go, oh, wow!
[13534.10 → 13539.84] We sold twice as many this quarter as we did last quarter.
[13540.58 → 13543.82] I project that we're going to sell twice as many again the next quarter.
[13543.98 → 13548.50] So you take all the money that you got back from that inventory that you bought and then
[13548.50 → 13553.56] sold, all the money you made on top of that, and you put it right back into buying more inventory.
[13554.36 → 13555.10] Well, hold on a second.
[13555.40 → 13556.68] What happened to all the profit?
[13556.68 → 13561.24] I can't pay my staff in screwdrivers and hoodies.
[13563.00 → 13563.80] Perk, sure.
[13564.26 → 13565.06] But payment?
[13565.28 → 13565.60] No.
[13565.76 → 13566.64] They can't pay their rent.
[13566.84 → 13568.82] They can't pay their food bill in screwdrivers.
[13568.92 → 13570.00] That's not how it works, right?
[13570.34 → 13576.58] So you have to carefully, as you are growing, manage your cash flow so you're keeping enough
[13576.58 → 13582.54] of the profitability to cover your operating expenses, and you are keeping enough of it
[13582.54 → 13587.56] to order more so that you have enough inventory for your growing business.
[13587.96 → 13592.34] And this is why a lot of businesses take on outside debt.
[13592.82 → 13596.66] We have made the decision to grow organically, to not take on outside debt.
[13596.80 → 13601.10] As it happens, right now, we do have a modest line of credit.
[13601.54 → 13605.10] And this is maybe going to sound a little out of touch, but we have about two and a half
[13605.10 → 13608.08] million Canadian dollars on our line of credit, if you must know.
[13608.46 → 13614.02] And that was part of the lead up to Black Friday, Cyber Monday, because we ordered in
[13614.02 → 13620.22] a whack ton of inventory alongside having some expensive outlays like the tech house and some
[13620.22 → 13625.30] other stuff that I'll get into fairly soon with you guys that all kind of hit us toward
[13625.30 → 13628.28] the middle to the end of 2025.
[13629.06 → 13633.96] And so for that reason, we had to dip into our line of credit, probably looking at how Black
[13633.96 → 13636.54] Friday went. We won't need that line of credit for much longer.
[13636.60 → 13638.74] But it's just part of managing your cash flow.
[13638.82 → 13643.46] And if for whatever reason your credit's not strong or is not pre-negotiated even, then it
[13643.46 → 13647.28] can be a big problem, even if you're growing, even if you're profitable.
[13647.88 → 13654.06] So why can't I just order a bunch and put it in a warehouse till it sells out in Europe,
[13654.26 → 13657.42] which is where I assume you want it because you're saying cheers from the Netherlands.
[13657.42 → 13665.06] Not only am I going to be tying up cash flow if I order too much, but what I could also
[13665.06 → 13670.06] be doing is I could be increasing my month to month operational expenses.
[13670.56 → 13672.04] Then it's a double whammy.
[13672.38 → 13677.96] That's really tough because I have a bunch of bills due for all this inventory that
[13677.96 → 13678.54] I purchased.
[13678.54 → 13681.58] It's sitting in a warehouse that now, guess what?
[13682.02 → 13688.16] Now I have to pay monthly, in some cases more frequently than monthly, for the storage
[13688.16 → 13691.10] of said inventory in said warehouse.
[13691.58 → 13695.52] Everybody at every stage in the chain has to feed their families, right?
[13695.54 → 13698.82] So I can't just tell that warehouse, oh, well, you should just store it for me for free.
[13698.90 → 13699.56] Why should they?
[13699.82 → 13700.72] I'm not a charity.
[13701.32 → 13702.18] They don't owe me anything.
[13702.18 → 13709.38] So unfortunately, it's always a fine balancing act when you're expanding between what you
[13709.38 → 13716.72] are forecasting for your sales, how much available cash flow you have, and what your partners
[13716.72 → 13721.50] can do to help to enable you to achieve your growth, what kind of credit you can draw from.
[13722.56 → 13723.54] It's complicated.
[13724.46 → 13726.46] We'd love to have an EU warehouse.
[13727.02 → 13727.56] We'd love to.
[13727.64 → 13728.32] It would be nice.
[13728.32 → 13728.76] Yes.
[13729.48 → 13735.80] Someday, you know, whatever entity is willing, we will.
[13736.84 → 13738.18] But it is not this day.
[13738.44 → 13738.70] No.
[13744.20 → 13745.50] What's up, boys?
[13746.04 → 13748.50] Linus, are there new sweatpants coming soon?
[13748.54 → 13749.20] Hold on one sec.
[13749.24 → 13749.60] Oh, boy.
[13749.84 → 13754.96] Mr. Noble says, making $22 million in AdSense last year, $2.5 million of credit is nothing.
[13754.96 → 13758.40] That $22 million in AdSense was all time.
[13759.14 → 13762.02] That's over the entire existence of the LTT channel.
[13762.14 → 13762.92] Since 2008?
[13762.92 → 13766.88] I saw quite a few people who were sort of confused by that from the interview.
[13767.14 → 13768.28] That was ever.
[13769.08 → 13770.12] Not in one year.
[13770.38 → 13770.52] Okay.
[13770.64 → 13770.86] Go ahead.
[13770.94 → 13771.08] Sorry.
[13771.94 → 13772.54] What's up, boys?
[13773.06 → 13775.00] Linus, are there new sweatpants coming soon?
[13775.22 → 13776.28] Missed the stealth ones?
[13776.44 → 13778.82] I guess Mr. Cheap over there got them all.
[13780.12 → 13781.26] New sweatpants coming soon?
[13781.26 → 13783.06] I think we have some new sweatpants coming.
[13783.06 → 13788.82] I don't have a time frame on those, but if we do, it will probably be in winter, spring.
[13789.18 → 13792.34] So it should be sometime.
[13793.42 → 13795.38] We'll definitely make sweatpants again at some point.
[13795.80 → 13797.32] There's the dropout sweatpants.
[13798.08 → 13799.96] Yeah, I don't think we have all the sizes in stock.
[13800.34 → 13803.46] Oh, I don't think the thing is showing properly.
[13803.50 → 13807.30] And another challenge with having different distribution centres around the world, you're
[13807.30 → 13811.08] looking at one site that doesn't necessarily mean that the other site has them in stock.
[13811.08 → 13813.28] Fun times.
[13813.40 → 13813.80] Challenges!
[13817.32 → 13818.10] Next one, Dan.
[13819.32 → 13819.86] Sure thing.
[13820.80 → 13824.34] Do you have any stretches of road that you like to drive on the bike?
[13825.52 → 13827.08] I unfortunately just...
[13828.04 → 13830.40] I haven't ridden my motorbike in three years.
[13830.66 → 13834.84] I, hopefully, they are going to put it together this winter and I will ride it in the spring.
[13834.84 → 13844.24] Um, for me, it's less about like a particular road, and it's more just like air, you know,
[13844.40 → 13845.82] and the, and the agility.
[13845.82 → 13849.14] I love just, I love the I love the space you have.
[13849.22 → 13851.40] You can create a lot of space for yourself on the motorbike.
[13851.52 → 13855.98] Like I, uh, my justification to myself, and you can call it rationalization.
[13855.98 → 13856.42] I don't care.
[13856.42 → 13856.98] I won't be offended.
[13857.56 → 13862.54] Um, but it's very clear that on a motorbike, if you get in an accident, you are very much
[13862.54 → 13865.38] more dead than you would be necessarily if you're a cager.
[13866.20 → 13869.78] Um, however, gosh darn.
[13870.30 → 13871.10] Yeah.
[13871.10 → 13871.38] Yeah.
[13871.60 → 13877.08] However, you can create a lot buffer space for yourself on a motorcycle than you
[13877.08 → 13878.42] can in a car.
[13878.62 → 13885.80] And so, you know, I can, when I'm passing, I can create like nine feet of space between
[13885.80 → 13886.94] me and any other vehicle.
[13886.94 → 13889.14] Whereas in a car, I'll be more like three feet away.
[13889.34 → 13897.18] So if someone is behaving unpredictably, I think I'm less likely to be obstructed
[13897.18 → 13901.36] by them in any way and end up in an accident on a bike, even if the consequences of said
[13901.36 → 13903.36] accident will be much worse on a bike.
[13903.48 → 13904.72] That is a tough line of thinking.
[13906.06 → 13907.64] You are, you are entitled to it.
[13907.72 → 13908.98] I'm a super defensive rider.
[13909.16 → 13910.16] I can tell you that much.
[13910.60 → 13911.88] Um, I was entitled to it.
[13911.92 → 13913.70] I create extra space for myself.
[13913.98 → 13917.00] I don't, I never want to be beside someone when I'm on the bike.
[13917.32 → 13919.28] I'm always watching 360.
[13919.88 → 13921.24] Uh, and it is, it is easier.
[13921.56 → 13923.10] It's, you have way better visibility.
[13923.72 → 13924.86] You're way smaller.
[13927.18 → 13928.34] Yeah.
[13928.44 → 13928.76] Scrap.
[13928.82 → 13930.00] You saying T-bones don't care.
[13930.10 → 13930.22] Yeah.
[13930.26 → 13932.16] There's a there's a decent amount of scenarios.
[13932.36 → 13932.82] That's so true.
[13932.92 → 13934.10] You can't correct for.
[13934.22 → 13934.88] That's so true.
[13935.18 → 13935.34] Yep.
[13935.42 → 13937.14] I believe that you do those things.
[13937.32 → 13937.54] Yep.
[13937.60 → 13941.58] And I believe that, you know, probably makes you safer than a lot of riders, but
[13941.58 → 13946.86] I, there are also just things that, you know, and a big part of it is the cargo fast,
[13946.94 → 13947.64] hit, go boom.
[13947.82 → 13950.24] There's a big part of it is the environment that I ride into.
[13950.36 → 13954.04] Like I mostly just commute to and from work highway there and back.
[13954.04 → 13961.26] Um, and so if, if I was, if I was in a different environment, it might be a completely different
[13961.26 → 13961.78] situation.
[13962.24 → 13964.36] So just make of that what you will, right?
[13964.44 → 13967.46] Like, I'm not saying that anything about my experience is applicable to your own.
[13967.46 → 13970.46] Just set up my NAS.
[13970.74 → 13976.50] Why is RAID 0 with all used SSDs and no offsite backup the safest layout?
[13976.76 → 13978.46] Well, thank you for MCM.
[13978.70 → 13983.90] The argument that Linus was just having, you know, if, if you're going RAID 0, all SSDs,
[13983.96 → 13986.74] used SSDs, you're going to pay more attention to your setup.
[13987.24 → 13989.38] Be a little bit more aware if anything is failing.
[13989.60 → 13990.40] I'm archiving this.
[13990.40 → 13994.62] Just be, you know, you're going to, you're going to be more careful.
[13994.72 → 13996.16] How could you curate that, Dan?
[13997.22 → 13997.66] What?
[13997.74 → 13998.38] What the heck?
[14000.52 → 14000.96] Fine.
[14001.46 → 14002.34] Hi, LLD.
[14002.74 → 14004.86] First time watching live from France.
[14005.40 → 14007.42] Thanks to the earlier schedule.
[14007.76 → 14008.16] Schedule?
[14008.34 → 14010.02] I don't know what I'm supposed to say anymore.
[14010.46 → 14015.80] You've mentioned many times that Sony PlayStation's controllers are much inferior to Microsoft
[14015.80 → 14017.22] slash Boxes.
[14017.68 → 14018.42] Can you explain why?
[14018.42 → 14022.52] Um, so first, the dual sense is amazing.
[14023.16 → 14032.16] Um, but going back to the dual shock series, personally, I and Luke from his hand gestures
[14032.16 → 14033.36] agrees.
[14033.82 → 14040.26] I prefer to have my thumbs in a symmetrical resting position.
[14040.50 → 14044.98] So I'm on my ABBY here, and I'm on my analog stick here.
[14044.98 → 14052.44] I do not prefer to be on my triangle, circle, square, whatever the last one is here.
[14052.68 → 14054.30] And then on my thumb stick here.
[14054.58 → 14057.36] I do not prefer that as my resting position.
[14057.50 → 14057.64] Yep.
[14057.78 → 14059.76] I'm not primarying the D-pad.
[14060.14 → 14060.78] That simple.
[14061.32 → 14061.58] Yep.
[14061.58 → 14065.12] Last one I got for you today.
[14065.44 → 14067.36] Good day, Lanky, Luke, and Dan.
[14067.54 → 14068.52] I don't have a special name.
[14068.88 → 14071.94] What is the best way to determine if a GPU is going bad?
[14072.22 → 14077.02] I have a 3060 Ti in my HP Omen desktop, and lately it seems like it's struggling with
[14077.02 → 14078.54] basic things like YouTube.
[14078.78 → 14082.74] I'd probably run a stress test, run Fur mark on it or something like that, see if its artifacts.
[14083.68 → 14084.68] Check if there's dust.
[14084.86 → 14085.60] Check your temperatures.
[14085.60 → 14087.82] Maybe repaste it, 3000 series.
[14088.22 → 14088.44] Yep.
[14088.64 → 14091.36] I mean, you're not going to be losing your warranty on it at this point.
[14091.70 → 14093.44] So you might as well give it a shot.
[14093.64 → 14097.06] I would definitely hit your system with a CDU.
[14097.36 → 14098.74] Just Google CDU.
[14098.80 → 14099.80] Give it a little freshening up.
[14099.86 → 14101.72] And then install your drivers fresh.
[14101.84 → 14102.96] See if the issues go away.
[14103.06 → 14105.54] Failing that, I would try a fresh Windows install.
[14105.70 → 14106.68] It's a 3060 Ti.
[14106.84 → 14110.70] So we're probably talking like a seven-year-old, eight-year-old Windows install by this point.
[14110.70 → 14115.50] And then if you're still having issues, then yeah, it might be a problem.
[14118.94 → 14119.52] All right.
[14119.98 → 14122.40] Well, hey, thanks for tuning in, you guys.
[14122.58 → 14123.76] We'll see you again next week.
[14124.16 → 14124.82] Same bad time.
[14124.94 → 14127.52] Well, probably back to the regular time next week.
[14127.88 → 14129.18] But definitely same bad channel.
[14129.28 → 14130.08] Probably, yeah.
[14130.32 → 14130.66] Bye!
[14130.66 → 14130.76] Bye!
[14133.76 → 14134.52] Bye!
[14140.70 → 14159.82] Bye!
[14159.82 → 14159.90] Bye!
[14159.90 → 14160.24] Bye!
