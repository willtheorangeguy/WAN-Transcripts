[0.00 --> 7.44]  It's WAN Showtime, and I for one am ticked, teed, peeved, irate.
[7.98 --> 9.56]  How can they do this?
[9.82 --> 12.18]  We've got a lot of great topics for you guys this week,
[12.48 --> 18.50]  starting of course with VPN Secure canceling lifetime subscriptions
[18.50 --> 21.46]  because they didn't know about them.
[22.36 --> 24.88]  What does that even mean?
[24.88 --> 30.22]  Oh, oh, oh, in much better news, we are officially the best at computer.
[30.50 --> 31.04]  That's right.
[31.24 --> 33.88]  We have this Guinness World Record to show that we computered
[34.46 --> 38.34]  more than anybody ever computered before, along with our partner Keoxia.
[38.66 --> 41.94]  Talking a little bit about the behind the scenes of that, how that came to pass.
[41.98 --> 42.70]  What else we got?
[44.46 --> 49.74]  Philips debuts 3D printable repair components for Philips products,
[49.82 --> 52.24]  which is cool and rather surprising.
[52.24 --> 56.82]  And also, apparently podcasters don't want public play counts.
[58.40 --> 62.16]  So I guess Philplane is very feature first on this one.
[62.18 --> 63.10]  I think I know why.
[63.30 --> 63.98]  I know why.
[64.78 --> 66.66]  Oh, people are upset I didn't say welcome to the WAN Show.
[66.78 --> 67.98]  Welcome to the WAN Show!
[67.98 --> 68.00]  Welcome to the WAN Show!
[82.24 --> 86.86]  It's been so many years since we actually sat on a couch.
[88.50 --> 88.94]  Yeah.
[89.18 --> 93.26]  The show is brought to you today by Vessi, Delete Me, and Squarespace.
[93.64 --> 97.84]  Of course, alongside our rap partner, Dbrand, our laptop partner, Dell,
[97.96 --> 101.48]  and our chair partner, oops, Secret Lab.
[102.18 --> 106.08]  Technically, it was only a little bit over a year because of the April Fool's stream.
[106.08 --> 107.14]  Oh, I guess that's fair.
[107.26 --> 107.86]  That is true.
[108.02 --> 108.26]  Haha!
[108.90 --> 112.16]  Yeah, Chewy was there fact-checking us, fact-checking us live.
[112.16 --> 112.92]  Oh, he said it too!
[113.92 --> 114.16]  Nice.
[114.22 --> 118.50]  Let's jump right into our headline topic, which is, of course,
[118.88 --> 123.44]  a lot of you in the comments on today's video on us getting,
[123.62 --> 125.52]  yes, my friends, it is real.
[125.52 --> 128.48]  The number of people that I saw being like, I thought it was a bit.
[128.98 --> 130.32]  I thought it was like a bit.
[130.42 --> 131.08]  No, no, no, no, no.
[131.24 --> 131.66]  No, no, no.
[131.72 --> 135.08]  It's 300 trillion bits.
[136.22 --> 137.44]  That's right, my friends.
[138.06 --> 138.82]  Thank you, Dan.
[139.28 --> 144.86]  We actually did get the verified Guinness World Record
[144.86 --> 147.90]  for calculating the most accurate value of pi,
[148.04 --> 153.02]  which was to 300 trillion decimal places.
[153.02 --> 160.60]  And I only vaguely remember how this came to be,
[160.76 --> 165.40]  but Luke, I kind of want to hear a little bit about how Infra has felt about this project
[165.40 --> 170.60]  that has been, as far as I can tell, very much in the way
[170.60 --> 175.72]  of things that they've been trying to do over the last, I would say, months,
[175.82 --> 177.46]  but realistically, it's been more like years.
[178.32 --> 179.88]  Yeah, and loud.
[179.88 --> 187.36]  I will tell you that the project started in the same way that a lot of projects start around here.
[187.86 --> 191.98]  And you guys probably remember back when we did the million-dollar PC.
[192.38 --> 195.04]  So we had these GPU compute nodes,
[195.32 --> 199.86]  and realistically, it was the oodles and oodles of high-speed PCIe storage
[199.86 --> 202.04]  that made it so expensive.
[202.04 --> 209.18]  So we showed, you know, what a, you know, data center class node could actually be used for.
[209.30 --> 211.88]  I believe we did some simulations on it and stuff like that.
[211.94 --> 217.50]  We showed how high-speed storage is so important to powering these kinds of workloads.
[217.74 --> 221.60]  And then we were done with it, and everybody wanted their hardware back,
[221.86 --> 224.86]  which made us kind of go reasonable.
[224.86 --> 226.86]  But hear me out.
[227.74 --> 235.14]  What if we keep the hardware, and since we've got it, we do something really cool with it?
[235.52 --> 242.20]  So whenever we get our hands on something that enables something that almost nobody else in the world could do,
[242.64 --> 247.92]  we are highly incentivized to try to do more stuff with that hardware.
[247.92 --> 254.30]  Not because there's actually, like, a compelling business reason for us to have had that stuff lying around.
[254.52 --> 261.12]  As far as I can tell, we have done absolutely nothing of use with the million-dollar PC
[261.12 --> 263.50]  in the entire time that we've had it.
[264.36 --> 269.98]  And the majority of that time has been to try and get this project going,
[270.06 --> 273.54]  which ended up being a huge challenge.
[273.54 --> 277.26]  Jake was, uh, Jake, I don't know if he ended up putting it in the final edit,
[277.26 --> 280.62]  because I saw a version of the edit that I signed off on,
[280.68 --> 281.90]  and I think we made some more changes.
[282.34 --> 289.16]  But basically, he has this spreadsheet where he went through, like, every tunable in Y Cruncher,
[289.44 --> 292.26]  and basically did, like, before, after, before, after, before, after, before.
[292.34 --> 295.42]  Like, it is the most flipping tuned Y Cruncher.
[295.44 --> 297.68]  Not because Y Cruncher's not good already,
[297.68 --> 304.10]  but because, as far as we can tell, nobody has ever used it quite like this
[304.10 --> 307.60]  with network-distributed storage in this fashion.
[309.18 --> 311.24]  So that's how the whole thing started.
[311.38 --> 316.92]  We were like, hey, we should try to find something else to do with this super-powerful hardware.
[316.92 --> 322.82]  Why don't we calculate more digits of pi?
[324.28 --> 326.24]  We kind of glossed over it in the video,
[326.44 --> 329.48]  but keeping this thing fed has been an absolute nightmare.
[329.62 --> 332.04]  And I want to, I want to, before, before Luke jumps in,
[332.06 --> 335.30]  I want to address one more thing that I saw a lot of in the comments,
[335.38 --> 339.42]  and that is, wow, your infrastructure in Canada must be s***
[339.42 --> 341.42]  if you guys lose power that often.
[341.42 --> 343.02]  Okay, a couple things.
[343.30 --> 349.18]  First of all, in this area in particular, yeah, it does kind of feel that way.
[349.70 --> 354.86]  Dude, we lose power at the office alarmingly frequently,
[355.24 --> 357.52]  especially given that this is an industrial zone,
[357.78 --> 360.26]  one that they are moving a hospital into.
[360.60 --> 366.10]  They are literally building a hospital across the street from labs,
[366.56 --> 368.16]  like, right there.
[368.16 --> 371.26]  And we have lost power, I kid you not,
[371.34 --> 375.06]  like, somewhere between half a dozen and ten times in the last calendar year.
[375.36 --> 377.20]  It has been unbelievable.
[377.94 --> 379.04]  With that said...
[379.04 --> 380.04]  Well, I was...
[380.04 --> 381.26]  Sorry, this is delayed today.
[381.26 --> 383.40]  At a certain point in my growing up,
[383.62 --> 389.22]  we lived on the same grid as the hospital
[389.22 --> 392.08]  that we were near at one point in time,
[392.44 --> 395.28]  and you would just never lose power.
[395.28 --> 396.58]  Like, the whole...
[396.58 --> 399.32]  Everyone else would lose power, and we would be fine forever.
[399.46 --> 402.18]  And then that stopped being a thing, and it was a sad day.
[402.26 --> 403.02]  It's all about priority.
[403.90 --> 407.74]  Yeah, I've also found that, oddly enough, for some reason,
[407.78 --> 409.80]  you're talking about how the infrastructure around us isn't that great,
[410.16 --> 413.62]  I find I lose power less than the office does.
[413.72 --> 414.72]  Oh, dude, this area...
[414.72 --> 418.52]  Like, my current residential setup is more resilient than the office area.
[418.52 --> 419.60]  This area is the pits.
[419.60 --> 425.62]  However, in their defense, there is kind of a good reason for it.
[425.98 --> 431.76]  This part of the lower mainland is quite built out, but not built up.
[432.04 --> 433.66]  So it's quite spread out.
[433.74 --> 434.72]  It kind of sprawls.
[435.22 --> 437.36]  And our power lines, because of that,
[437.72 --> 442.02]  were cost-effectively constructed on wooden poles, right?
[442.12 --> 444.80]  So our power poles and our telephone poles,
[444.90 --> 446.64]  they kind of share infrastructure,
[447.10 --> 449.04]  and they're just overhead power lines.
[449.04 --> 450.90]  So if you've ever been to Vancouver,
[451.38 --> 454.66]  you might know that we are known for having...
[454.66 --> 457.50]  for not just leveling all of the trees in our cities,
[457.70 --> 459.08]  which is nice.
[459.64 --> 462.22]  You know, beautiful even, you might say.
[462.44 --> 465.14]  Beautiful British Columbia, that's what it says on our license plates.
[465.90 --> 467.92]  But it is a bit of a double-edged sword,
[468.20 --> 471.10]  and when we have a windstorm, which, hey, you know,
[471.26 --> 472.64]  just like the rest of the world,
[472.90 --> 475.90]  seems to be happening a lot more frequently around here these days,
[475.90 --> 480.18]  I wonder if there's some kind of thing that might be contributing to that.
[480.28 --> 480.70]  I don't know.
[480.76 --> 481.52]  It's a great mystery,
[481.52 --> 485.06]  at least for, you know, half of the world that can't figure it out.
[486.00 --> 489.18]  We're having a lot more windstorms lately than we used to,
[489.18 --> 492.98]  and so branches and trees are coming down on those power lines
[492.98 --> 495.34]  a lot more than they used to.
[495.44 --> 501.66]  So our infrastructure was designed for the very mild climate
[501.66 --> 503.30]  that we used to have,
[503.52 --> 507.68]  and the very mild storms that we used to have,
[507.68 --> 512.48]  and now our climate tends to dip lower in lows during the winter,
[512.74 --> 515.42]  get higher in the highs during the summer,
[515.54 --> 517.58]  and we tend to have a lot more windstorms.
[517.60 --> 521.60]  So it's been a learning curve, I guess,
[521.76 --> 525.08]  is what I would say.
[525.40 --> 526.96]  That doesn't mean I'm happy about it.
[527.14 --> 529.84]  It wasn't great that we lost power a bunch of times
[529.84 --> 531.30]  during the pie attempt,
[531.42 --> 534.36]  and also just generally lose power a lot.
[534.70 --> 536.84]  It's pretty inconvenient for business operations,
[536.84 --> 538.38]  but overall,
[538.78 --> 542.14]  I don't think it's slowed us down too much over the years.
[542.38 --> 544.04]  Okay, so what have you guys gone through?
[544.10 --> 546.56]  Because there's been cooling failures, power failures,
[547.08 --> 548.90]  just generally us being up in your biz.
[549.26 --> 551.84]  Like, infra must be not that stoked on this project, hey?
[552.98 --> 555.22]  Dan might have more to comment here than me,
[555.32 --> 558.56]  but honestly, that's those same things, basically,
[558.88 --> 561.40]  because in a few cases,
[561.40 --> 563.80]  we've been called and tried to help with that sound.
[563.80 --> 568.80]  And even with the actually fairly extensive sound deadening
[568.80 --> 570.80]  that that room has on it,
[572.16 --> 573.58]  the infra team has sat,
[573.74 --> 575.38]  especially Thomas,
[576.14 --> 577.68]  has sat right next to it.
[578.68 --> 580.84]  And straight through all that sound deadening,
[581.00 --> 582.94]  it's been real loud
[582.94 --> 585.50]  and screaming real hard the whole time.
[585.50 --> 589.20]  I got some notes from Jake here.
[589.26 --> 590.60]  I mentioned that this is going to be a topic,
[590.72 --> 592.18]  and asked if there's anything he wanted to add.
[592.98 --> 593.32]  He said,
[593.38 --> 595.52]  don't pick the cheapest HVAC quote.
[596.74 --> 598.76]  He said that a lot of people were commenting on
[598.76 --> 601.16]  asking how it was actually verified,
[601.34 --> 604.20]  or if we just calculated 300 trillion digits of nothing.
[604.76 --> 605.54]  But apparently,
[605.66 --> 608.84]  it's something called BBP extraction,
[608.84 --> 612.54]  or Bailey-Borwin-Ploof extraction,
[612.84 --> 617.02]  where you can calculate specific ranges of digits
[617.02 --> 618.40]  instead of the whole thing.
[619.82 --> 621.94]  So Alexander Yee,
[622.02 --> 622.92]  the Y-Cruncher dev,
[623.00 --> 624.84]  ran two separate BBP verifications
[625.46 --> 627.04]  against the last chunk of digits
[627.04 --> 628.20]  in hex form to validate.
[628.84 --> 630.90]  And this took around six hours each
[630.90 --> 632.62]  on a very fast computer.
[632.76 --> 633.64]  So apparently, no,
[633.70 --> 634.88]  you don't have to run the whole thing twice.
[634.88 --> 637.80]  And it gets spot-checked
[637.80 --> 639.80]  against the existing record sets,
[640.20 --> 642.80]  including $202 trillion
[642.80 --> 644.58]  and $100 trillion from Google, etc.
[646.64 --> 647.64]  And yeah,
[647.78 --> 649.72]  Jake is also saying that he could run over to the set
[649.72 --> 651.68]  and add some context or questions,
[651.76 --> 652.50]  which could be cool.
[652.72 --> 653.14]  Sure, yeah.
[653.24 --> 655.50]  No, this has been Jake's pet project
[655.50 --> 658.00]  for over a year at this point,
[658.10 --> 659.36]  getting it over the line.
[659.94 --> 664.00]  It's amazing how dedicated that young man can be.
[664.00 --> 666.38]  when the objective is purely
[666.38 --> 668.92]  to create the world's largest peen.
[672.92 --> 674.20]  That makes a lot of sense.
[674.36 --> 675.98]  For quite literally no purpose
[675.98 --> 679.42]  other than to have the biggest computer peen.
[681.84 --> 684.90]  I'm not saying he doesn't work hard on other stuff.
[685.00 --> 686.06]  In fact, someone,
[686.54 --> 688.44]  Casper Explore in the float plane chat says,
[688.50 --> 689.82]  hey, I thought you guys just made a video
[689.82 --> 691.74]  about DIYing battery backup.
[692.16 --> 693.52]  Battery backup the lab?
[694.16 --> 694.96]  He's been trying,
[695.04 --> 696.90]  he's actually been trying to get me
[696.90 --> 699.86]  to do like a massive power backup project here
[699.86 --> 701.56]  for quite some time.
[701.66 --> 702.76]  And yes,
[703.14 --> 704.80]  the like weird,
[705.08 --> 706.04]  we know it's
[706.04 --> 709.10]  at least a little bit sketchy
[709.10 --> 711.02]  setup that I have at my house right now
[711.02 --> 713.48]  was meant to be stage one.
[714.00 --> 715.92]  Stage two is hopefully like
[715.92 --> 716.90]  a bigger setup
[716.90 --> 718.24]  at my house
[718.24 --> 719.90]  because that's still
[719.90 --> 721.20]  a manageable scale.
[721.62 --> 723.70]  And if these projects continue
[723.70 --> 724.92]  to pique people's interest,
[725.42 --> 726.92]  stage three could be
[726.92 --> 728.08]  a larger,
[728.26 --> 729.76]  more resilient solution
[729.76 --> 731.22]  that's here at the office.
[731.22 --> 732.32]  So, you know,
[732.44 --> 733.00]  never,
[733.16 --> 734.64]  never underestimate,
[735.50 --> 736.66]  never underestimate
[736.66 --> 737.78]  this young man,
[737.84 --> 738.86]  whether he's doing something
[738.86 --> 739.70]  actually useful,
[739.70 --> 740.60]  like, you know,
[740.80 --> 741.84]  DIYing a UPS
[741.84 --> 743.22]  for a fraction of the cost
[743.22 --> 744.52]  or whether he's
[744.52 --> 747.28]  doing this.
[749.42 --> 750.60]  Yeah, yeah.
[750.60 --> 753.84]  I don't know.
[753.98 --> 755.36]  I know he's in the chat right now
[755.36 --> 756.46]  if people have questions
[756.46 --> 757.80]  over in float plane chat.
[758.94 --> 759.88]  He's coming over.
[760.00 --> 760.32]  Oh, is he?
[760.38 --> 760.56]  Okay.
[761.20 --> 761.98]  He's going to join you.
[762.10 --> 762.94]  Isaac V asks,
[763.06 --> 764.20]  why not a diesel generator
[764.20 --> 765.38]  so you guys can keep going?
[765.46 --> 766.50]  Maybe a more proven way
[766.50 --> 766.96]  for business.
[767.10 --> 767.26]  So,
[767.74 --> 768.74]  a diesel generator
[768.74 --> 770.04]  is not as simple
[770.04 --> 770.74]  as just like
[770.74 --> 772.18]  buy a diesel generator.
[772.56 --> 773.50]  You have to actually like
[773.50 --> 774.78]  make sure the diesel fuel
[774.78 --> 775.70]  doesn't go bad.
[775.78 --> 776.58]  Like when we checked out
[776.58 --> 777.46]  Equinix's setup,
[777.90 --> 779.20]  they had to have
[779.20 --> 780.10]  like their own
[780.10 --> 781.52]  fuel conditioning
[781.52 --> 782.36]  I think it's called
[782.36 --> 783.32]  but basically like
[783.32 --> 784.82]  to rejuvenate the fuel
[784.82 --> 785.52]  on site
[785.52 --> 786.04]  and make sure
[786.04 --> 787.14]  that it doesn't go bad
[787.14 --> 789.24]  in their storage tanks
[789.24 --> 790.54]  that like tanks
[790.54 --> 791.10]  are underground
[791.10 --> 792.28]  but also like
[792.28 --> 793.20]  they have like
[793.20 --> 794.14]  I think they have like
[794.14 --> 795.22]  counterweight or something
[795.22 --> 796.04]  so they don't like
[796.04 --> 796.92]  float in a flood
[796.92 --> 797.16]  or what
[797.16 --> 798.04]  like it's not
[798.04 --> 801.86]  it's not that simple
[801.86 --> 803.56]  to do an entire building
[803.56 --> 804.46]  diesel backup
[804.46 --> 805.34]  and it does
[805.34 --> 806.42]  take ongoing maintenance
[806.42 --> 807.70]  and the
[807.70 --> 808.54]  the actual
[808.54 --> 810.08]  business disruption
[810.08 --> 811.28]  of our occasional
[811.28 --> 812.06]  power outages
[812.06 --> 813.10]  is not
[813.10 --> 813.58]  pretty low
[813.58 --> 815.44]  that high
[815.44 --> 816.88]  like if it goes out
[816.88 --> 817.92]  for an hour or two
[817.92 --> 818.82]  we can just be like
[818.82 --> 819.62]  okay well
[819.62 --> 820.50]  um
[820.50 --> 822.70]  realistically
[822.70 --> 823.52]  all we can do
[823.52 --> 824.64]  is lean or clean
[824.64 --> 825.70]  so find one of those
[825.70 --> 826.42]  things to do
[826.42 --> 827.48]  um
[827.48 --> 827.88]  and
[827.88 --> 829.24]  a lot of the time
[829.24 --> 830.30]  it's out overnight
[830.30 --> 831.26]  like it's
[831.26 --> 832.16]  it hasn't
[832.16 --> 833.92]  you have to do
[833.92 --> 834.96]  a business
[834.96 --> 836.56]  like cost analysis
[836.56 --> 837.82]  um
[837.82 --> 839.18]  okay if you guys
[839.18 --> 839.94]  have questions
[839.94 --> 840.66]  jake's gonna sit

[913.36 --> 913.82]  adapter
[913.82 --> 915.08]  are we allowed to talk
[915.08 --> 916.30]  about the load
[916.30 --> 916.94]  of utter horse
[916.94 --> 918.24]  that getting one
[918.24 --> 919.00]  of these certificates
[919.00 --> 919.78]  is these days
[919.78 --> 921.66]  i don't know
[921.66 --> 922.20]  that that
[922.20 --> 923.00]  is this on
[923.00 --> 923.94]  can you hear me
[923.94 --> 924.28]  through here
[924.28 --> 925.22]  i can i can't hear
[925.22 --> 925.88]  you through here
[925.88 --> 926.38]  look mom
[926.38 --> 927.40]  i can hear you
[927.40 --> 927.90]  um
[927.90 --> 929.10]  i don't know
[929.10 --> 929.84]  that i want
[929.84 --> 930.46]  to do that
[930.46 --> 932.32]  okay because
[932.32 --> 933.50]  i gotta tell you
[933.50 --> 934.40]  it was a lot of work
[934.40 --> 934.70]  though
[934.70 --> 935.50]  i'll tell you this
[935.50 --> 936.02]  much okay
[936.02 --> 937.12]  the process
[937.12 --> 938.06]  of getting the
[938.06 --> 938.54]  certificate
[938.54 --> 939.62]  is definitely
[939.62 --> 940.30]  different
[940.30 --> 941.40]  from what the
[941.40 --> 942.30]  process was
[942.30 --> 943.22]  back when we did
[943.22 --> 943.94]  highlander
[943.94 --> 944.76]  like almost
[944.76 --> 945.48]  10 years ago
[945.48 --> 946.28]  it's also very
[946.28 --> 946.90]  different if you're
[946.90 --> 947.74]  doing it for like
[947.74 --> 950.34]  i'm a personal
[950.34 --> 951.60]  record i'm like
[951.60 --> 952.82]  i'm on my
[952.82 --> 953.22]  calculator
[953.22 --> 954.56]  the most bananas
[954.56 --> 955.44]  finding pie
[955.44 --> 956.50]  in a minute or
[956.50 --> 957.32]  something i don't
[957.32 --> 958.00]  know yeah yeah
[958.00 --> 959.22]  or reciting pie
[959.22 --> 960.06]  from your brain
[960.06 --> 962.14]  um you don't
[962.14 --> 962.82]  usually i think you
[962.82 --> 963.52]  don't have to pay
[963.52 --> 964.30]  money or it's not a
[964.30 --> 965.64]  very large amount
[965.64 --> 966.24]  of money but when
[966.24 --> 966.78]  you're doing something
[966.78 --> 967.34]  that's corporate
[967.34 --> 968.64]  it's advertising
[968.64 --> 971.92]  so they expect to
[971.92 --> 972.84]  get paid for it
[972.84 --> 975.20]  and um
[975.20 --> 976.10]  and a lot
[976.10 --> 977.50]  yeah not 300
[977.50 --> 979.32]  300 trillion digits
[979.32 --> 980.62]  of paid but
[980.62 --> 982.34]  more than two
[982.34 --> 983.14]  there's a password
[983.14 --> 983.82]  on this laptop
[983.82 --> 984.88]  more than three
[984.88 --> 985.88]  i don't know
[985.88 --> 986.36]  can you get
[986.36 --> 986.90]  can you get
[986.90 --> 987.40]  multiple
[987.40 --> 988.62]  more than four
[988.62 --> 989.62]  we have the
[989.62 --> 990.64]  the world record
[990.64 --> 991.64]  thing for
[991.64 --> 992.82]  for highlander
[992.82 --> 993.70]  you don't have
[993.70 --> 994.34]  it do you only
[994.34 --> 995.58]  i thought they sent
[995.58 --> 996.14]  them to all the
[996.14 --> 996.64]  participants
[996.64 --> 998.48]  no i i have
[998.48 --> 999.18]  one oh oh

[1003.10 --> 1004.32]  one um but like
[1004.32 --> 1005.50]  like how many of
[1005.50 --> 1006.32]  that do you have
[1006.32 --> 1008.04]  one
[1008.04 --> 1009.66]  you you can get
[1009.66 --> 1010.30]  as many as you

[1055.60 --> 1056.08]  play a game
[1056.08 --> 1056.70]  i want to play
[1056.70 --> 1056.96]  a game
[1056.96 --> 1057.52]  okay dan
[1057.52 --> 1058.66]  dan you're part
[1058.66 --> 1059.06]  of the game
[1059.06 --> 1060.62]  i would like
[1060.62 --> 1062.56]  you to guess
[1062.56 --> 1063.88]  for each of us
[1063.88 --> 1065.42]  how many times
[1065.42 --> 1066.54]  we've watched
[1066.54 --> 1067.34]  mr bezos
[1067.34 --> 1067.90]  eat shit
[1067.90 --> 1069.28]  how many times
[1069.28 --> 1069.74]  we've watched
[1069.74 --> 1070.06]  the clip
[1070.06 --> 1070.64]  okay so each
[1070.64 --> 1071.26]  of us each of
[1071.26 --> 1071.82]  us has to kind
[1071.82 --> 1072.20]  of think
[1072.20 --> 1073.28]  and write down
[1073.28 --> 1073.80]  what we think
[1073.80 --> 1074.70]  what we think
[1074.70 --> 1075.24]  it is how many
[1075.24 --> 1075.80]  times we think
[1075.80 --> 1076.28]  we've watched
[1076.28 --> 1076.52]  it
[1076.52 --> 1077.36]  and if you
[1077.36 --> 1077.84]  watch it on
[1077.84 --> 1078.58]  loop each loop
[1078.58 --> 1079.20]  counts as one
[1079.20 --> 1079.70]  each loop
[1079.70 --> 1080.52]  counts as one
[1080.52 --> 1081.34]  so hold on
[1081.34 --> 1081.92]  let me let me
[1081.92 --> 1082.44]  think for a
[1082.44 --> 1082.68]  second
[1082.68 --> 1084.64]  um okay if
[1084.64 --> 1085.22]  you show it to
[1085.22 --> 1085.84]  someone else
[1085.84 --> 1086.60]  how many views
[1086.60 --> 1087.24]  does that count
[1087.24 --> 1087.88]  as is that just
[1087.88 --> 1088.86]  one or does it
[1088.86 --> 1089.72]  like count as a
[1089.72 --> 1090.30]  multiple view
[1090.30 --> 1091.16]  no i think that's
[1091.16 --> 1092.04]  your okay that's
[1092.04 --> 1092.82]  just one okay
[1092.82 --> 1098.24]  um okay i got my
[1098.24 --> 1099.06]  number i got my
[1099.06 --> 1102.00]  number all right i
[1102.00 --> 1102.64]  think i've got some
[1102.64 --> 1104.32]  two because did you
[1104.32 --> 1105.24]  show it on wanshow
[1105.24 --> 1107.54]  uh no like i don't
[1107.54 --> 1109.18]  did we yes oh we
[1109.18 --> 1110.02]  did oh i didn't
[1110.02 --> 1110.52]  count that one
[1110.52 --> 1111.32]  like hundreds of
[1111.32 --> 1112.34]  thousands no no no
[1112.34 --> 1113.38]  no no it only counts
[1113.38 --> 1114.12]  as one it counts as
[1114.12 --> 1116.16]  one okay i mean does
[1116.16 --> 1117.04]  it count as like half
[1117.04 --> 1117.66]  of one just because
[1117.66 --> 1118.58]  you're short okay
[1118.58 --> 1119.42]  let's see how well
[1119.42 --> 1120.24]  let's see how well
[1120.24 --> 1122.42]  done i look small
[1122.42 --> 1123.46]  right now it's oh
[1123.46 --> 1124.28]  because luke has a
[1124.28 --> 1126.06]  big torso right yeah
[1126.06 --> 1127.52]  my chair is lower
[1127.52 --> 1129.02]  than linus's okay
[1129.02 --> 1130.22]  dan that's weird
[1130.22 --> 1131.66]  okay dan each loop
[1131.66 --> 1132.78]  counts each loop
[1132.78 --> 1133.90]  counts all right so
[1133.90 --> 1134.82]  for linus i'm gonna
[1134.82 --> 1136.46]  say uh around 120
[1136.46 --> 1138.30]  oh come on that's
[1138.30 --> 1139.68]  not realistic is it
[1139.68 --> 1140.54]  not who would have
[1140.54 --> 1142.10]  time for that i mean
[1142.10 --> 1143.22]  like spread out over
[1143.22 --> 1144.08]  many many weeks like
[1144.08 --> 1144.68]  we watched it maybe
[1144.68 --> 1145.86]  four or five times on
[1145.86 --> 1146.54]  the wan show at
[1146.54 --> 1149.30]  least did we yeah
[1149.30 --> 1151.00]  it was funny i don't
[1151.00 --> 1151.66]  know if we watched
[1151.66 --> 1152.68]  it that many times
[1152.68 --> 1153.56]  jake maybe i'm gonna
[1153.56 --> 1154.70]  say i don't know
[1154.70 --> 1156.22]  20 20 30 something
[1156.22 --> 1157.72]  like that no not
[1157.72 --> 1159.32]  that funny and
[1159.32 --> 1159.90]  what do you want me
[1159.90 --> 1160.62]  to say or am i
[1160.62 --> 1161.56]  waiting i guess
[1161.56 --> 1162.38]  waiting and then
[1162.38 --> 1163.52]  maybe maybe luke like
[1163.52 --> 1164.56]  10 to 20 times or
[1164.56 --> 1165.26]  something do you think
[1165.26 --> 1167.76]  luke dude what okay
[1167.76 --> 1170.10]  all right okay so we
[1170.10 --> 1170.58]  have a bit of a
[1170.58 --> 1171.60]  problem here because i
[1171.60 --> 1172.80]  put down seven but i
[1172.80 --> 1173.78]  forgot that we watched
[1173.78 --> 1175.00]  it multiple times when
[1175.00 --> 1175.62]  we were looking at it
[1175.62 --> 1176.28]  on wan show so
[1176.28 --> 1176.98]  realistically i'm
[1176.98 --> 1177.68]  probably closer to
[1177.68 --> 1178.02]  20.
[1178.02 --> 1179.70]  we also watched it
[1179.70 --> 1181.34]  like 10 10 times
[1181.34 --> 1182.40]  during writers meeting
[1182.40 --> 1183.84]  i don't think i was
[1183.84 --> 1184.48]  there for that one
[1184.48 --> 1185.32]  yeah you might have
[1185.32 --> 1186.14]  been in the car still
[1186.14 --> 1186.66]  or something did you
[1186.66 --> 1187.64]  guys really oh yeah
[1187.64 --> 1189.70]  yeah we were analyzing
[1189.70 --> 1192.22]  like how did he biff
[1192.22 --> 1194.34]  this oh he's just bad
[1194.34 --> 1196.24]  at walking dan said
[1196.24 --> 1198.02]  i think 20 for me the
[1198.02 --> 1198.96]  number that i came up
[1198.96 --> 1200.10]  for myself was 15
[1200.10 --> 1201.64]  15 okay so dan
[1201.64 --> 1202.80]  nailed you what i what
[1202.80 --> 1203.80]  i didn't realize
[1203.80 --> 1205.24]  originally is that it's
[1205.24 --> 1206.86]  not like a short loop
[1206.86 --> 1210.52]  pause oh oh i missed
[1210.52 --> 1212.08]  it it's not it's like
[1212.08 --> 1213.90]  uh it's it's not a
[1213.90 --> 1214.94]  loop it's like a video
[1214.94 --> 1215.60]  that you have to scroll
[1215.60 --> 1217.08]  back on yeah so maybe
[1217.08 --> 1218.40]  you know 120 is probably
[1218.40 --> 1219.32]  a little bit yeah that's
[1219.32 --> 1219.94]  probably you don't just
[1219.94 --> 1221.18]  watch it well no i mean
[1221.18 --> 1222.68]  people have i mean i did
[1222.68 --> 1224.56]  rewind like yeah yeah
[1224.56 --> 1225.68]  but it was manual show
[1225.68 --> 1227.22]  the people no no no
[1227.22 --> 1228.44]  that's i don't want to
[1228.44 --> 1229.82]  get copyright strike this
[1229.82 --> 1231.76]  is transformative baby no
[1231.76 --> 1232.64]  i don't want to get a
[1232.64 --> 1233.76]  copyright strike over it
[1233.76 --> 1235.08]  dude from daddy bezos
[1235.08 --> 1235.70]  dude we've been
[1235.70 --> 1237.04]  copyright striked for
[1237.04 --> 1238.34]  like showing game
[1238.34 --> 1239.90]  trailers well that is
[1239.90 --> 1241.38]  like the one thing that
[1241.38 --> 1242.64]  you get copy strike yeah
[1242.64 --> 1243.86]  it's ridiculous not even
[1243.86 --> 1245.02]  just nintendo ones either
[1245.02 --> 1246.32]  just being poody pie dude
[1246.32 --> 1248.08]  it's literally promotional
[1248.08 --> 1250.72]  content it's literally ads
[1250.72 --> 1252.20]  can we copy strike linus
[1252.20 --> 1254.40]  tech tips it's an old meme
[1254.40 --> 1255.92]  but it checks out i like it
[1255.92 --> 1257.34]  it's good it's pretty good i
[1257.34 --> 1258.04]  got it
[1258.04 --> 1260.16]  um chat says yes we can
[1260.16 --> 1261.30]  what are we supposed to be
[1261.30 --> 1262.44]  talking about right now
[1262.44 --> 1263.94]  oh yeah what's your number
[1263.94 --> 1265.04]  what's your number what's
[1265.04 --> 1265.74]  your number i'm gonna go
[1265.74 --> 1266.92]  with like probably dan i
[1266.92 --> 1267.62]  think dan was right it's
[1267.62 --> 1269.08]  probably 20 times probably
[1269.08 --> 1270.04]  probably and a good like
[1270.04 --> 1271.52]  15 of those was just the
[1271.52 --> 1272.64]  first time i saw it
[1272.64 --> 1274.24]  it's just on repeat
[1274.24 --> 1275.76]  dude it's so funny
[1275.76 --> 1277.00]  it's so funny
[1277.00 --> 1279.26]  um okay right so did you
[1279.26 --> 1280.46]  did it did anybody actually
[1280.46 --> 1281.82]  like put any questions in
[1281.82 --> 1282.82]  the chat or anything i'm
[1282.82 --> 1283.86]  gonna watch the clip on the
[1283.86 --> 1285.96]  laptop myself there was a
[1285.96 --> 1287.50]  there's a there's oh man
[1287.50 --> 1288.44]  what was one of the things
[1288.44 --> 1289.30]  that i had wanted to
[1289.30 --> 1289.72]  address
[1289.72 --> 1291.40]  if i type bezos biffing
[1291.40 --> 1292.46]  it will it come up
[1292.46 --> 1293.36]  it does
[1293.36 --> 1295.28]  what was the most annoying
[1295.28 --> 1297.22]  thing about working on the
[1297.22 --> 1298.18]  the pie record jake
[1298.18 --> 1303.02]  honestly i think the power
[1303.02 --> 1304.82]  outages are one thing i would
[1304.82 --> 1307.10]  go with when we were near the
[1307.10 --> 1309.20]  end like like in february
[1309.20 --> 1312.76]  march timeline the ac was just
[1312.76 --> 1315.44]  crapping its pants with no
[1315.44 --> 1317.76]  suitable explanation so this is
[1317.76 --> 1320.60]  an amazing uh amazingly
[1320.60 --> 1323.02]  engineered system okay so it
[1323.02 --> 1324.68]  has error codes they're little
[1324.68 --> 1326.80]  lights not um not stored
[1326.80 --> 1327.94]  anywhere they're just blinking
[1327.94 --> 1329.94]  lights yeah nice and they're
[1329.94 --> 1331.56]  enterprise they're on both
[1331.56 --> 1333.06]  sides so if there's an error
[1333.06 --> 1334.00]  with the outside unit it
[1334.00 --> 1334.88]  blinks the light on the
[1334.88 --> 1335.90]  outside unit which means you
[1335.90 --> 1336.96]  have to go outside get on a
[1336.96 --> 1338.34]  ladder take the thing off to
[1338.34 --> 1340.16]  see it the inside unit also has
[1340.16 --> 1342.78]  error codes if it shuts off like
[1342.78 --> 1343.94]  you know when you're trying to
[1343.94 --> 1345.22]  do a world record and you really
[1345.22 --> 1347.44]  need the bloody ac to turn back
[1347.44 --> 1348.62]  on so you go flip the breaker
[1348.62 --> 1349.76]  and like come on turn back on
[1349.76 --> 1351.72]  the codes go away forever and
[1351.72 --> 1354.12]  there's no history nothing
[1354.12 --> 1357.40]  saved so you know what happened
[1357.40 --> 1360.16]  like the first seven times we
[1360.16 --> 1361.60]  had no idea what was wrong with
[1361.60 --> 1363.48]  it nice literally none and even
[1363.48 --> 1365.02]  the hvac guys were like i don't
[1365.02 --> 1369.06]  know come on you're like 250
[1369.06 --> 1370.78]  dollars an hour what the heck
[1370.78 --> 1373.68]  anyways it ended up being that
[1373.68 --> 1375.98]  the ac system had basically no
[1375.98 --> 1377.36]  refrigerant left in it it was
[1377.36 --> 1378.76]  supposed to have like i don't
[1378.76 --> 1379.68]  know i don't want to say a number
[1379.68 --> 1380.56]  because i don't know the actual
[1380.56 --> 1382.08]  number let's say it's 10 pounds of
[1382.08 --> 1383.14]  refrigerant supposed to be in this
[1383.14 --> 1386.46]  loop right there was like 0.6 i
[1386.46 --> 1388.86]  don't know how this keeps
[1388.86 --> 1390.40]  happening do you know how many
[1390.40 --> 1393.50]  times they had leaks in that one
[1393.50 --> 1395.56]  mini split system in the server room
[1395.56 --> 1397.54]  over here it's probably leaked like a
[1397.54 --> 1400.78]  dozen times i okay and i'm not
[1400.78 --> 1402.14]  even i'm not even trying to be a
[1402.14 --> 1403.86]  jerk about it yeah right because
[1403.86 --> 1406.30]  it's it's easy right it's easy to
[1406.30 --> 1407.58]  look at someone else's job and be
[1407.58 --> 1408.94]  like oh it can't be that hard you
[1408.94 --> 1410.68]  know professional athletes how do you
[1410.68 --> 1412.60]  miss that no i could my grandma
[1412.60 --> 1413.78]  could have kicked that in you know
[1413.78 --> 1415.46]  whatever right like that's easy to
[1415.46 --> 1419.38]  do but like in this case i actually
[1419.38 --> 1421.36]  have installed a mini split system
[1421.36 --> 1423.16]  yeah and yours are mint right
[1423.16 --> 1427.08]  yeah they work great how fucking hard
[1427.08 --> 1428.98]  is this brian the electrician hvac
[1428.98 --> 1434.82]  man i mean yes i did get help but
[1434.82 --> 1437.24]  nothing that we did nothing we did
[1437.24 --> 1439.10]  was super complicated yeah you get
[1439.10 --> 1441.74]  some copper tube you raise some
[1441.74 --> 1443.70]  fittings on it and you make sure
[1443.70 --> 1446.54]  they're tight what are they doing i
[1446.54 --> 1448.36]  mean like no shade the one in creator
[1448.36 --> 1450.24]  warehouse broke a month ago too okay
[1450.24 --> 1452.72]  let's give them a little shade um you
[1452.72 --> 1456.14]  did also approve the cheapest hvac quote
[1456.14 --> 1458.24]  we got okay i didn't i had nothing to
[1458.24 --> 1460.18]  do with it i told them get something
[1460.18 --> 1463.78]  good i i can't control i can't control
[1463.78 --> 1466.46]  what people actually go ahead with yeah
[1466.46 --> 1470.94]  yeah sure great literally though who did
[1470.94 --> 1472.88]  it i don't know man it doesn't matter
[1472.88 --> 1474.68]  we don't yeah i'm gonna throw anybody
[1474.68 --> 1476.70]  under the bus there's no point the the
[1476.70 --> 1478.26]  company that does the maintenance now is
[1478.26 --> 1481.60]  a lot better but yeah it was rough and
[1481.60 --> 1483.22]  to be clear i think maybe you're like
[1483.22 --> 1486.06]  overestimating the like average effort
[1486.06 --> 1488.70]  and that that your average contractor is
[1488.70 --> 1491.24]  putting in oh i'm really not did i did i
[1491.24 --> 1492.40]  ever show you the pictures of my lawn
[1492.40 --> 1492.84]  right now
[1492.84 --> 1495.90]  with the gravel on it did you show them
[1495.90 --> 1497.34]  the pictures of your lawn with the gravel
[1497.34 --> 1497.86]  did i
[1497.86 --> 1502.42]  dude it's so bad wait has it been fixed
[1502.42 --> 1505.50]  yet they are there today like with what
[1505.50 --> 1508.80]  to their credit 70 rakes to their credit
[1508.80 --> 1512.96]  the company that screwed it up big vacuum
[1512.96 --> 1515.40]  dude we'd already think it is a big vacuum
[1515.40 --> 1518.86]  we had already paid them we had already
[1518.86 --> 1520.88]  paid them so like if they were anything
[1520.88 --> 1522.44]  like some of the contractors that we've
[1522.44 --> 1524.22]  worked with in the past they would have
[1524.22 --> 1527.82]  just ghosted us a hundred percent um but
[1527.82 --> 1530.10]  no they're they're actually good guys
[1530.10 --> 1531.72]  they actually came back so what they're
[1531.72 --> 1534.02]  doing is basically they're putting an
[1534.02 --> 1537.26]  inch of topsoil over our entire lawn oh
[1537.26 --> 1538.68]  then you're gonna have like the mintous
[1538.68 --> 1539.16]  drainage
[1539.16 --> 1542.20]  yeah to a point to a point yeah and then
[1542.20 --> 1543.56]  once it's saturated it's game over
[1543.56 --> 1547.28]  well does your lawn have like uh drainage
[1547.28 --> 1550.30]  underneath like drainage pipes yeah oh i'm
[1550.30 --> 1551.96]  surprised that there was just one part
[1551.96 --> 1554.00]  that like didn't and a couple other
[1554.00 --> 1555.48]  little spots that were a little bit
[1555.48 --> 1557.66]  soggy so yvonne was like hey can you
[1557.66 --> 1560.14]  guys come and just kind of address that
[1560.14 --> 1562.50]  and they came and dumped gravel all over
[1562.50 --> 1563.60]  the whole thing because of a
[1563.60 --> 1564.38]  miscommunication
[1564.38 --> 1567.78]  so what happened was the company whose
[1567.78 --> 1570.58]  job it is is to just deliver like
[1570.58 --> 1573.86]  wheelbarrows of crap to a job site oh i
[1573.86 --> 1576.58]  see where they got it wrong and then the
[1576.58 --> 1578.28]  guys that were just like the guys to
[1578.28 --> 1580.18]  just spread the stuff over they didn't
[1580.18 --> 1581.66]  question it because they were like why
[1581.66 --> 1583.72]  would they deliver the wrong thing and
[1583.72 --> 1585.56]  then when the super shows up on the
[1585.56 --> 1588.46]  site he goes oh my god what happened
[1588.46 --> 1594.06]  i'm laughing at both this story and
[1594.06 --> 1596.22]  jeff bezos falling on my laptop on
[1596.22 --> 1596.50]  repeat
[1596.50 --> 1599.28]  he's got to get his count up
[1599.28 --> 1602.66]  well okay so one thing is line line
[1602.66 --> 1603.64]  said we weren't going to go off the
[1603.64 --> 1606.22]  rails i'm watching joe uh oh yeah you
[1606.22 --> 1608.04]  got my laptop going here oh yeah this is
[1608.04 --> 1610.70]  great i've got my subway surfers doing
[1610.70 --> 1611.26]  my job
[1611.26 --> 1614.20]  he was just too excited
[1614.20 --> 1619.10]  so what did you promise at the start of
[1619.10 --> 1620.68]  the show that we were going to stay on
[1620.68 --> 1621.14]  the rails
[1621.14 --> 1623.88]  all right we have not stayed on the
[1623.88 --> 1625.36]  rails today on an airplane like
[1625.36 --> 1625.68]  tonight
[1625.68 --> 1626.64]  don't worry about it
[1626.64 --> 1629.48]  i haven't seen a lot of questions
[1629.48 --> 1630.30]  with the pie stuff
[1630.30 --> 1632.10]  oh i got one i saw is why didn't you
[1632.10 --> 1633.50]  calculate it to pie
[1633.50 --> 1635.74]  i you know now that everyone has
[1635.74 --> 1638.24]  said that i'm like wow i'm an idiot
[1638.24 --> 1640.12]  uh yeah we should have done that
[1640.12 --> 1643.30]  the thing is to 300 trillion 69 or
[1643.30 --> 1645.44]  something like there's what was why
[1645.44 --> 1646.92]  the round number so there's a few
[1646.92 --> 1649.40]  factors here it's like the main
[1649.40 --> 1650.98]  concern is your storage space right
[1650.98 --> 1653.36]  because you have the memory in the
[1653.36 --> 1655.50]  computer that's your like active
[1655.50 --> 1657.22]  working memory and then the storage
[1657.22 --> 1659.50]  space isn't used to store the output
[1659.50 --> 1662.46]  i mean it is later on but it's used
[1662.46 --> 1665.04]  as swap space which is just like
[1665.04 --> 1667.04]  memory but slower right you know when
[1667.04 --> 1668.92]  your computer has a swap it's it's
[1668.92 --> 1671.52]  it's slow but in this case it's swap
[1671.52 --> 1673.12]  that's 100 gigabytes a second so it's
[1673.12 --> 1675.56]  fast but not as fast as three terabytes
[1675.56 --> 1676.20]  of ddr5
[1676.20 --> 1678.96]  anyways um where was i going with this
[1678.96 --> 1681.16]  uh uh uh oh yeah right okay so
[1681.16 --> 1682.86]  originally we were trying to do 200
[1682.86 --> 1684.32]  trillion digits and we had the storage
[1684.32 --> 1687.00]  capacity for that and then when we were
[1687.00 --> 1689.06]  trying to do 300 trillion digits we
[1689.06 --> 1693.00]  were like we're gonna have 98 percent
[1693.00 --> 1695.14]  of the like we were gonna use 98 percent
[1695.14 --> 1697.36]  of the capacity right okay but i later
[1697.36 --> 1699.56]  found out like right before the run you
[1699.56 --> 1701.54]  don't actually have to output both sets
[1701.54 --> 1703.50]  of digits so traditionally people would
[1703.50 --> 1705.54]  output the hexadecimal version which is
[1705.54 --> 1706.76]  what is actually calculated by the
[1706.76 --> 1708.92]  program and the decimal version the
[1708.92 --> 1710.98]  decimal version is longer takes up more
[1710.98 --> 1713.28]  space but that's what you would
[1713.28 --> 1715.24]  traditionally read 3.1415 blah blah blah
[1715.24 --> 1716.98]  blah right the hexadecimal format
[1716.98 --> 1718.68]  wouldn't really like mean a whole lot to
[1718.68 --> 1721.10]  most people until you base convert it
[1721.10 --> 1723.12]  but you don't have to output it so i
[1723.12 --> 1725.76]  disabled it which saved us like 120
[1725.76 --> 1727.60]  terabytes compressed so we could have
[1727.60 --> 1730.40]  used that extra space to calculate 14
[1730.40 --> 1733.64]  trillion more digits but i would have
[1733.64 --> 1735.80]  settled for just like 69 more than that
[1735.80 --> 1738.10]  you know what here's the pr response i
[1738.10 --> 1740.70]  do that here's the pr response because
[1740.70 --> 1742.02]  then we would have a guinness record
[1742.02 --> 1744.92]  that was that's iconic what do you mean
[1744.92 --> 1747.28]  uh yeah um no no here's the pr response
[1747.28 --> 1749.96]  you know for us this was you know just
[1749.96 --> 1752.54]  about the collaboration with keoxia our
[1752.54 --> 1754.06]  partner on this project well they're
[1754.06 --> 1756.06]  great and we wanted to we wanted to leave
[1756.06 --> 1758.34]  an opportunity for the next person to come
[1758.34 --> 1760.50]  along and do it to pi digits no that's
[1760.50 --> 1763.08]  wrong i actually have the real answer um
[1763.08 --> 1765.20]  in y cruncher when you're setting up the
[1765.20 --> 1767.52]  run when you type in how many digits
[1767.52 --> 1769.38]  there's a short form version you can just
[1769.38 --> 1772.78]  write 300t if i had to write the whole
[1772.78 --> 1774.30]  thing that would have been like that
[1774.30 --> 1775.56]  would have been a few more seconds more
[1775.56 --> 1777.54]  numbers to click and like you might have
[1777.54 --> 1780.14]  gotten carpal tunnel yeah i wouldn't have
[1780.14 --> 1781.78]  wanted that i genuinely no i wouldn't have
[1781.78 --> 1782.82]  wanted to be paying for that
[1782.82 --> 1786.22]  you don't want to pay for that we already
[1786.22 --> 1788.42]  established this look at the frame buddy
[1788.42 --> 1789.98]  that's that's covered that's already
[1789.98 --> 1791.62]  covered he already pays he pays for that
[1791.62 --> 1793.86]  anyways yeah no i think our i think our
[1793.86 --> 1796.08]  premiums go i think our our our like
[1796.08 --> 1798.04]  deductible and premiums go up if people
[1798.04 --> 1799.96]  use everything premiums go up otherwise i
[1799.96 --> 1801.70]  think it'll be fun yeah no i i think i
[1801.70 --> 1803.78]  think it goes up if everybody only if
[1803.78 --> 1804.74]  you fill in the form
[1804.74 --> 1810.24]  okay dan has never filled the form i
[1810.24 --> 1811.54]  don't want to cost linus money no
[1811.54 --> 1812.94]  everyone has to fill out the form
[1812.94 --> 1814.56]  properly you can't joke about that
[1814.56 --> 1817.56]  unless you're linus no i fill out the
[1817.56 --> 1819.18]  form it's extremely important you fill
[1819.18 --> 1820.46]  out the i have somebody fill out the
[1820.46 --> 1823.28]  form form that sounds more correct that
[1823.28 --> 1825.46]  sounds a lot oh delegation i
[1825.46 --> 1827.54]  sign management training i sign the form
[1827.54 --> 1829.88]  i sign the form i have a merch message
[1829.88 --> 1832.00]  if i get a boo-boo if i get a boo-boo
[1832.00 --> 1834.54]  on set i sign the form okay yes how
[1834.54 --> 1836.52]  much is there even to fill out before
[1836.52 --> 1838.38]  you sign it it's like nothing you don't
[1838.38 --> 1840.62]  even fill it out like you have vance fill
[1840.62 --> 1842.88]  out like no the issue is that no the
[1842.88 --> 1845.22]  issue is that i have to like go and find
[1845.22 --> 1847.54]  someone on the safety committee to like
[1847.54 --> 1850.30]  see it filled out like it's the whole
[1850.30 --> 1852.44]  process of it i take great joy in it
[1852.44 --> 1853.82]  because usually it's dennis that's been
[1853.82 --> 1855.54]  filling it out for me and i always enjoy a
[1855.54 --> 1858.42]  good little conversation with dennis so
[1858.42 --> 1860.00]  they they just they have it filled out
[1860.00 --> 1861.22]  and they bring it to me and then i sign
[1861.22 --> 1862.42]  it and that way the shoot doesn't have
[1862.42 --> 1864.08]  to be interrupted and i can just keep
[1864.08 --> 1865.46]  filming that's how it works for
[1865.46 --> 1868.06]  everybody is it he's not special oh well
[1868.06 --> 1869.98]  that's good yeah it is the process that
[1869.98 --> 1871.30]  actually sounds like a way smarter
[1871.30 --> 1872.96]  process so that's good because the i
[1872.96 --> 1874.14]  don't know how to fill out this form
[1874.14 --> 1876.20]  there's like six boxes they could have
[1876.20 --> 1877.66]  any information what am i supposed to
[1877.66 --> 1879.88]  put where it says name they fill it up
[1879.88 --> 1883.36]  for you yeah where did you get your cut
[1883.36 --> 1885.20]  what were you doing what are you
[1885.20 --> 1886.48]  filling the parking lot what's my
[1886.48 --> 1890.30]  address i don't know it hurts here's
[1890.30 --> 1892.38]  your band-aid that will cost us an
[1892.38 --> 1894.22]  extra thousand a month in premium my
[1894.22 --> 1895.92]  favorite field is how are we going to
[1895.92 --> 1898.64]  prevent this in the future i i have
[1898.64 --> 1901.02]  literally written i have actually dumb i
[1901.02 --> 1902.86]  have filled it out for myself a few
[1902.86 --> 1904.66]  times and i have literally written not
[1904.66 --> 1905.36]  do that again
[1905.36 --> 1910.12]  does that qualify is that good i think so
[1910.12 --> 1912.18]  there's like if the cause is just that i
[1912.18 --> 1912.84]  was stupid
[1912.84 --> 1916.98]  just no i think if it's your stupid and
[1916.98 --> 1918.50]  you've never done this thing before and
[1918.50 --> 1920.18]  you don't need to do it again then i
[1920.18 --> 1921.64]  think yeah it's fair to just be like
[1921.64 --> 1923.24]  well drill through your hand why did you
[1923.24 --> 1925.52]  do it in the first place luke gosh i
[1925.52 --> 1927.68]  think i didn't know yeah it was a
[1927.68 --> 1929.12]  learning i didn't know it would hurt
[1929.12 --> 1932.22]  yeah okay sorry dan you want to just
[1932.22 --> 1934.46]  yeah how much electricity did it cost
[1934.46 --> 1935.28]  in the socket
[1935.28 --> 1938.28]  uh i mean probably more than what was
[1938.28 --> 1940.12]  shown in the video because that didn't
[1940.12 --> 1943.28]  well actually no i put a year yeah yeah
[1943.88 --> 1945.06]  yeah yeah yeah okay so that's probably
[1945.06 --> 1945.56]  about right
[1945.56 --> 1948.30]  yeah well i don't even remember i blocked
[1948.30 --> 1950.28]  it it was like i blocked it from my mind
[1950.28 --> 1952.86]  just for your reference just so you can
[1952.86 --> 1955.34]  thanks re-sear this into your brain i
[1955.34 --> 1956.86]  believe what the calculator said was
[1956.86 --> 1958.96]  like eighty six hundred dollars canadian
[1958.96 --> 1963.46]  that is wild i mean nobody tell him
[1963.46 --> 1965.90]  about the the boink project going on
[1965.90 --> 1968.46]  right now we can take some solace in the
[1968.46 --> 1970.54]  fact that this is more useful than
[1970.54 --> 1974.76]  mining a lot of cryptocurrency so at
[1974.76 --> 1976.62]  least there's that or as useful is it oh
[1976.62 --> 1980.02]  i see it's as useful there are equally
[1980.02 --> 1981.84]  pointless things that we could have
[1981.84 --> 1983.96]  burned fossil fuels for what do people
[1983.96 --> 1986.34]  use that many just it's nothing you
[1986.34 --> 1988.46]  don't you don't it's like something i
[1988.46 --> 1989.80]  think what people have been saying is
[1989.80 --> 1991.64]  like nasa even in their craziest
[1991.64 --> 1993.76]  calculations use like 34 digits or
[1993.76 --> 1994.72]  something like that yeah and you can
[1994.72 --> 1997.08]  calculate something something the entire
[1997.08 --> 1999.38]  size of the universe to an atom to the
[1999.38 --> 2002.00]  site yeah um in like with like a couple
[2002.00 --> 2003.90]  dozen a few dozen digits of pi or
[2003.90 --> 2004.78]  something that's what the youtube
[2004.78 --> 2006.34]  comments tell me we know how accurate
[2006.34 --> 2008.84]  those are yeah well engineers use like
[2008.84 --> 2010.58]  yeah they just round it to four
[2010.58 --> 2014.14]  yeah they round up it's like good enough
[2014.14 --> 2017.92]  uh will swami by the way made the point
[2017.92 --> 2020.08]  better than i possibly could have as to
[2020.08 --> 2022.96]  why no we are not printing this out at
[2022.96 --> 2025.32]  linus tech tips a production printer is
[2025.32 --> 2027.28]  rated for about 1 million sheets per
[2027.28 --> 2029.68]  month it would literally take 1,000
[2029.68 --> 2032.74]  months to print that aka 83 years now
[2032.74 --> 2034.18]  that sounds like a skill issue you
[2034.18 --> 2036.58]  clearly just need more printers duh yeah
[2036.58 --> 2037.96]  what are you talking about yeah like what
[2037.96 --> 2039.58]  about those big newspaper printer
[2039.58 --> 2041.24]  machine things have you seen those those
[2041.24 --> 2043.96]  things rip larger paper they did they did
[2043.96 --> 2046.60]  network distributed pie calculations they
[2046.60 --> 2048.04]  could do network distributed printing
[2048.04 --> 2050.14]  brother some of the comments on this video
[2050.14 --> 2052.42]  really are amazing as a mechanic watching
[2052.42 --> 2054.46]  this video and trying to understand it
[2054.46 --> 2057.28]  made me realize what other people hear when i talk about cars
[2057.28 --> 2062.32]  literally nothing yeah that's great
[2062.32 --> 2066.28]  it's exhausting i told the girlfriend yeah i
[2066.28 --> 2071.98]  i needed a super what no no i i needed a supercharger it's just an
[2071.98 --> 2077.98]  alternator it it's for charging it's it needed that it makes a noise a
[2077.98 --> 2081.24]  spinning noise yeah yeah that's good for it yeah you got it cheap because the
[2081.24 --> 2083.66]  bearings are gone exactly yeah yeah yeah
[2083.66 --> 2091.28]  father and son episodes are so wholesome i just think we need to get linus a supercharger
[2091.28 --> 2098.74]  hey since you're here oh boy uh since you're here um there were some people who had some concerns
[2098.74 --> 2104.12]  about the battery backup ah she's mint at my place she's mint um for now yeah so
[2104.12 --> 2112.52]  she's mint so i i scouted the location oh please i was i was gonna ask you about this yeah so so we we we
[2112.52 --> 2119.24]  hear you and we actually did want to put the battery banks outside that was the original
[2119.24 --> 2126.28]  plan anyway uh but it was a lot easier for the proof of concept which yeah he's telling us to move on so
[2126.28 --> 2129.80]  maybe we'll make this the last thing we chat about and then we'll actually do that that's clever
[2129.80 --> 2136.28]  yeah um well he has to deal with a host with adhd you also don't have to listen or two it's just
[2136.28 --> 2142.44]  it's just a guide yeah double your pleasure double your fun today hell yeah one for each hand so we
[2142.44 --> 2146.92]  are aware that it would be better to have the batteries outside um but we wanted to do this
[2146.92 --> 2152.12]  proof of concept for a couple of reasons number one is that i didn't want to go all in and spend
[2152.12 --> 2156.28]  tens of thousands of dollars on something that we would then discover you know what this is actually
[2156.28 --> 2161.88]  kind of beyond our scope he had no faith is the answer yeah well that we have we have bitten off more
[2161.88 --> 2168.44]  than we can chew in the past i'll i'm just gonna say that okay and number two is because jake needed
[2168.44 --> 2173.48]  to do a smaller scale project so that he can put in all his tickets at the christmas party to get the
[2173.48 --> 2178.84]  cast off one after i stop using the initial deployment i'm just gonna borrow it forever what do you mean
[2181.88 --> 2187.40]  alex alex wild alex dick our logistics manager is gonna be like thank you jake i really appreciate
[2187.40 --> 2191.40]  you for getting this giant thing out of the warehouse just sign it thanks sign it out to
[2191.40 --> 2197.40]  jake that's 100 percent gonna be his answer i would like for the record to make it very clear
[2197.40 --> 2201.88]  that that is not how that works for any other employees who are watching this right 100 only
[2201.88 --> 2210.28]  for jake no that's what linus is saying no no that is not yeah luke just steals stuff that is not how it
[2210.28 --> 2215.00]  works it's not how it works that is not how it works i i those are the two reasons for the smaller
[2215.00 --> 2221.24]  scale deployment because jake wants one and because i didn't want to go full hog immediately so
[2221.40 --> 2226.76]  good news and bad news which one do you want first i don't know like i'm not gonna listen to your bad
[2226.76 --> 2232.68]  news anyway so just send it okay whatever yeah so the good news is the good news is i have full faith
[2232.68 --> 2238.44]  now because that deployment actually for all the concerns that people raised about it there is a few
[2238.44 --> 2242.68]  kind of valid like oh we should have connectors on the things like yes i know that and there should
[2242.68 --> 2248.68]  be covers on some of the you know high current that's why there's connectors on some of them and not
[2248.68 --> 2253.72]  others it's because they gave us the wrong size okay so that's the good news yeah the bad news is
[2253.72 --> 2258.44]  we don't have a straight run from the mech room to the outside oh wait no i didn't i already tell
[2258.44 --> 2266.60]  we solved this this is adhd right okay incarnate unfortunately by the panel outside yeah like
[2266.60 --> 2273.80]  where the power comes into the house there's not a great spot for it yeah but we don't need a great spot
[2273.80 --> 2279.72]  we just need a spot oh no you don't go down the side of your house
[2279.72 --> 2283.56]  pshh pshh pshh
[2283.56 --> 2284.76]  he doesn't
[2287.56 --> 2292.12]  am i wrong when was the last time you went down the side of your house before me asking you to go
[2292.12 --> 2297.72]  there to pick blueberries so it would have been last august what because there's a year okay you can
[2297.72 --> 2302.20]  you can work around it like in the summer i go there okay so like in the summer i go there we
[2302.20 --> 2306.76]  need to mount the like inverter thingy so the original plan was to put it in the mech room and
[2306.76 --> 2312.04]  like make a concrete box or concrete board or something where you know you have an hour of
[2312.04 --> 2318.68]  it exploded and put some like fire retardant stuff in there like whatever right um but then we were
[2318.68 --> 2323.72]  jesus uh and then we were like let's just put everything outside because the inverter needs to go
[2323.72 --> 2329.16]  upstream of the main panel anyway so that we can ac couple the solar to it yeah so why are we putting
[2329.16 --> 2333.56]  inside let's just put everything outside so if the if the inverter is on the side of your house yes
[2333.56 --> 2340.36]  how far are these batteries going to be um like how many how many iphones tall is this run going to be
[2340.36 --> 2347.16]  it's going to be okay to get it kind of like out of the way this better be an iphone to get it out
[2347.16 --> 2353.56]  of the way it would probably be about 40 iphones it's pretty it's pretty far like batteries from
[2353.56 --> 2358.76]  the inverter um yeah is there like anything we can put it on there or is that that's dirt
[2359.56 --> 2364.52]  and we're pouring we're pouring a pad it's dirt or or we'll ask for a pad and instead we'll get
[2364.52 --> 2372.20]  large gravel it's strawberry plants that's 19.2 feet wow wait what what iphones are we talking pro maxes
[2372.20 --> 2377.16]  what do you what are you comparing that's the iphone 12 14 okay sorry how many iphone 13 minis let's go
[2377.16 --> 2382.36]  with that um and this is wait this is in your backyard or is this still on the side of the house on the side
[2382.36 --> 2386.76]  of the house how do you care about the plants on the side of the house well i mean they're strawberries
[2386.76 --> 2393.88]  like they you know the kids like them they eat strawberries there you know like kids do this is
[2393.88 --> 2399.56]  going to be like losing power kids eat strawberries it's going to be a monumentally larger monumentally
[2400.28 --> 2407.72]  yeah sure larger project yeah and i'm i'm i gotta confess hundreds of kilograms of batteries i'm not
[2407.72 --> 2413.08]  super stoked on like the size of it this is like pallets of batteries yes i know i know jake yeah
[2413.08 --> 2421.16]  yeah like did you tell them not trivial um no i don't think so oh well we what we were talking
[2421.16 --> 2428.44]  about was like 200 kilowatt hours yeah so the idea was that we could use a thousand wait i can show
[2428.44 --> 2434.52]  them i can show them for 200 hours so literally if we were using the house normally we could be down for like
[2434.52 --> 2440.28]  like three days okay this sounds four days wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on your lap is
[2440.28 --> 2446.36]  totally warranted and this does sound insane but when you do it diy it's actually less expensive than
[2446.36 --> 2450.60]  you would think i mean obviously we're talking about tens of thousands of dollars but we're not actually
[2450.60 --> 2456.04]  talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars surprisingly sure does that sound like does this
[2456.04 --> 2460.36]  this sounds like something that would cost like 150 yeah that sounds quite reasonable am i crazy a lot of
[2460.36 --> 2465.80]  power yeah no it it sounds like the kind of thing that if we went and we got it you know quoted
[2465.80 --> 2471.32]  properly that they would want like hundreds of thousands of dollars for but it's it's actually how
[2471.32 --> 2476.36]  do i do this less than you'd think how do i do uh here i got you why does this say oh luke lap like
[2476.36 --> 2485.16]  laptop yeah not like why is there a lap cam that costs extra per month this is way after dark okay so this is
[2485.16 --> 2489.88]  eve is one of the major chinese lfp battery manufacturers this is like one of their newer
[2489.88 --> 2498.12]  models it's 314 amp hours at 3.2 volts it's roughly one kilowatt hour this cell if you buy between 100 and
[2498.12 --> 2504.68]  2 000 of them is 60 us dollars yeah before obviously before shipping obviously before tariffs if you're in
[2504.68 --> 2514.60]  the us i'm so sorry um get shrieked but what if we buy 50 000 pieces 250 of them times 60 it's 15 grand
[2515.16 --> 2521.40]  yeah for 250 kilowatt hours which is a lot of money a lot of money but that's a lot that's like how
[2521.40 --> 2526.12]  much is a power like a tesla power wall that is a freaking hold on does the does the bulk discount get
[2526.12 --> 2535.40]  any better uh no right yeah when you buy 500 000 okay yeah so a power wall is only 13 and a half
[2535.40 --> 2541.00]  kilowatt hours and how much does it cost 16 um something like i forget i forget how much they're
[2541.00 --> 2545.48]  they're freaking expensive because you gotta get it but that includes the inverter yeah yeah yeah so it
[2545.48 --> 2550.44]  it includes more this is just raw power we actually still need to do the install we still need an
[2550.44 --> 2556.52]  inverter so something we like inverter wise like this is no bms are we planning to just like oh hey are we
[2556.52 --> 2561.32]  planning to just weld these together or like uh no it'll be like a bus bar situation no no no no no
[2561.32 --> 2565.56]  this is actually not getting bad the vero bms that thing's super cool right that was built for
[2565.56 --> 2575.40]  for car swaps tesla swaps specifically you know say what you will about that guy um but their batteries
[2575.40 --> 2579.72]  are very useful for ev swapping vehicles all right that's what i'm going with this sure um
[2579.72 --> 2589.16]  they made a new thing called i think it's called like the vero node oh he'll figure it out yeah okay
[2589.16 --> 2594.92]  it's not out yet but they made a here's a here's our diy balance board that hooks up to the main thing
[2595.72 --> 2600.36]  so you buy these and then i think they support like i don't want to say a number because i don't know but
[2600.36 --> 2605.80]  like 15 cells or something like that right and so you they're 150 bucks you buy their website is down i
[2605.80 --> 2611.48]  wonder why that is um way to go wancho thanks wancho i hadn't even opened it yet like what the
[2611.48 --> 2618.04]  they're quick yeah you said it too quick yeah just the last thing you want to do is like talk about a
[2618.04 --> 2623.24]  funny domain that's available or whatever because they're like they're on it okay so don't do it so
[2623.24 --> 2629.88]  16 cells in series which if i remember correctly 16 times 3.2 i think that's the optimal yeah yeah yeah
[2629.88 --> 2634.36]  so about 48 so 16 is how many usually how you want in series so we would need one of these for each
[2634.36 --> 2641.40]  series set so you're talking like a few grand in bms nodes yeah you're talking like the inverters get
[2641.40 --> 2648.28]  way more expensive the one we used for this project was the eg4 6k xp whatever but that was sized for
[2648.28 --> 2655.40]  like the rack six kilowatt and the and some but like not for the house so this is 18 kilowatts in one box
[2655.40 --> 2661.88]  and it's seven grand yeah so it's it's almost it kind of scales almost linearly to be honest yeah um
[2661.88 --> 2668.04]  they also have a cool one called like the grid boss i think it's called the grid boss oh flex boss
[2668.04 --> 2673.48]  the grid box is like the integration thing this is the bigger one and to be clear there are also like
[2673.48 --> 2678.44]  there's other companies that make these the eg4 one worked pretty good power your neighborhood dude
[2678.44 --> 2684.12]  yeah um i don't know that we will for sure use this but this is something that they said that they had and
[2685.08 --> 2690.60]  that was cool we might need to use like two or three though it really depends because you were telling me
[2690.60 --> 2695.08]  you wanted to be able to charge your car off of this like you talking charging your car at full rate
[2696.52 --> 2701.96]  because that's like that's a few i i don't think i would i don't think i would expect to actually
[2701.96 --> 2707.48]  charge my car off it that seems stupid i mean that seems pretty dumb what is it with that said now i
[2707.48 --> 2713.40]  mean you could charge your car off is it a 30 amp very little uh i think it's a 30 amp yeah so but is
[2713.40 --> 2719.48]  that actually the charge rate like it's a 40. no it's pretty weak i i like got the wrong ones basically i i
[2719.48 --> 2724.20]  asked for a specific one and then the contractors ordered a different one from the same company
[2724.76 --> 2729.64]  and i was like yo that's not what i asked for oh i know which one you have it's the dual head one
[2729.64 --> 2733.96]  yeah it's the dual head one but there was they have a different one that would do full speed off of
[2733.96 --> 2738.92]  one head but this one is the cheaper one that only does half speed off of each one oh it's this one
[2738.92 --> 2744.44]  it's the sun country one right yeah something like that yeah okay so it's like 40 amps total but when you're
[2744.44 --> 2751.16]  charging two cars you get 16 amps each so this is a 7.7 kilowatt yeah this is the yeah it actually
[2751.16 --> 2755.16]  takes like a minute to charge my car i mean to be fair for your use case it's probably it's totally
[2755.16 --> 2760.92]  fine but we could get some we get some ubiquity ev stations yeah i've been i'll i'll do it eventually
[2761.72 --> 2766.12]  i don't know if they're csa approved yet that could be a thing ah it could be a problem um but
[2766.60 --> 2773.40]  anyways so these are hardwired this is not that much though no no well it's it's not that much in terms of
[2773.40 --> 2781.00]  like the the rate of charge yeah but i just having batteries in your yard uh-huh so that you can
[2781.00 --> 2788.52]  charge the batteries in your car feels a little silly well it is right you are yes yes uh-huh okay
[2788.52 --> 2792.76]  i'm glad we got there all right so anyway we're supposed to be talking we're supposed to be doing
[2792.76 --> 2797.40]  merch messages so wait i want to do one i've never done this before oh my god this guy he's like he
[2797.40 --> 2803.48]  he doesn't even want to go i gotta go on a flight too oh yeah right have you never gonna win uh not
[2803.48 --> 2810.20]  in a long time brother like christmas years ago yeah nobody does win anymore yeah yeah it's we're on
[2810.20 --> 2816.44]  the we're on the streak so introverted boys over here um yeah so have you packed dude i did all my
[2816.44 --> 2822.12]  laundry yesterday i'm proud usually i'm doing laundry at 11 p.m the night before nice yeah it's
[2822.12 --> 2828.68]  pretty good actually i know i did my laundry yesterday too wow actually i don't want to
[2829.80 --> 2834.68]  you were sick you got me sick you know i said i'm gonna be so mad if you got me sick i'm like
[2834.68 --> 2841.00]  sniffily now and it's your fault why did i touch you why would i touch you you i got it for you literally
[2841.00 --> 2846.20]  nobody else i know is sick and i've barely been around anyone else other than you and you were like
[2846.20 --> 2851.72]  actively sniffily oh boy it's your fault all right well that's possible uh all right fine i'll
[2851.72 --> 2856.44]  explain logged into the thing i'll explain merch messages i'll just hack luke's account here hold on
[2856.44 --> 2862.52]  merch messages are the way to interact with the show and we've got some pretty exciting reasons to
[2862.52 --> 2871.00]  send a merch message it worked we have that's right my friends our biggest t-shirt expansion ever
[2871.00 --> 2879.48]  we have three fantastic hold on i'm getting to it we have three fantastic new colors sky forest and
[2879.48 --> 2885.72]  chocolate this right here is sky this is forest and this is chocolate excuse me i'm just messing with
[2885.72 --> 2892.92]  them um and you can get all of these new colors as a short sleeve that is long or a long sleeve you can
[2892.92 --> 2900.12]  get them in regular and you can get them in tall sizing wow let's go look at his arms let's go this is a
[2900.12 --> 2909.40]  medium look at his arms i'm six foot two that is crazy look i'm i'm repping the brand on top of that
[2909.40 --> 2915.96]  we added tall sizing and long sleeve options for our core colors black and olive so there's a whole
[2915.96 --> 2924.20]  lot of new t-shirts that you can now get at lmg.gg t-shirt check it out boys let's go man we've got
[2924.20 --> 2931.56]  some mileage out of lmg.gg that domain is like 60 bucks a year it's it's it's affordable i know that's
[2931.56 --> 2936.68]  a no that's a lot is it domains oh yeah that's really expensive i don't know how much domains
[2936.68 --> 2942.52]  cost i don't know what could it cost like ten dollars yeah but literally it costs ten dollars
[2943.08 --> 2952.20]  nobody commented about that um okay we also have to announce we have pre-tariff pricing on mcm at uh
[2952.20 --> 2959.16]  uh lttstore.com the the us version so we have uh pre-tariff pricing on individual magnetic cable
[2959.16 --> 2964.12]  management components this week and if you're wondering global customers you already have
[2964.12 --> 2968.28]  pre-tariff pricing when converted to usd in fact it's actually a little bit cheaper than that so you
[2968.28 --> 2979.40]  can shop now at lmg.gg mcm check them out there you go uh anyway as for you know what you can do with
[2979.40 --> 2983.40]  that purchase when you add it to your cart you can leave a merch message there'll be a little box and
[2983.40 --> 2989.96]  it'll go to producer dan there he is who will curate your message for me and luke also he's here this
[2989.96 --> 2994.60]  week for some reason i guess uh for me and luke or he will respond to it himself or forward it to
[2994.60 --> 3000.52]  someone who will address it later so dan do we have a couple merch messages so you can show the people how
[3000.52 --> 3010.92]  they work i do i've got one here from um lanky lanky person yeah lots of blank tall sizes why hello lld
[3010.92 --> 3016.20]  as a recently diagnosed adhd person what are some of the pros or cons you all find about both having
[3016.20 --> 3021.00]  and working with an adhd person well working with luke why don't you answer that one what's
[3021.00 --> 3026.92]  it like working with an adhd person all three of us you guys saw it earlier where he was like
[3026.92 --> 3032.60]  oh we're not going to be able to let's get too far of a run oh and then it's like no we're putting
[3032.60 --> 3040.20]  it outside luke do you have an answer he disconnected for a second oh he might just be ignoring maybe he
[3040.20 --> 3046.44]  doesn't want to anymore frankly i couldn't blame him it's it's cool because you can his mic's not
[3046.44 --> 3052.28]  working oh bummer like you you can it's a superpower and it is also your worst nightmare at the same time
[3052.28 --> 3057.80]  i mean if you being the person that's asking i'm sure you're aware of this uh you can focus
[3057.80 --> 3064.36]  so hard when you're in the zone but when you're not in the zone you cannot focus on does that button
[3064.36 --> 3070.44]  work how do i do it maybe is it gonna be a problem if it doesn't work i don't know try it i don't do it
[3070.44 --> 3077.16]  do it what was i even gonna say see that that is what it is what and you don't get to pick when you
[3077.16 --> 3084.84]  focus exactly and you also don't get to pick when you stop focusing that which is also bad that would
[3084.84 --> 3091.48]  be a great superhero like has anyone ever done that as a superhero gimmick where they like focus man like
[3091.48 --> 3095.88]  they they can't pick when their powers are active and not well you kind of seen that when like spider
[3095.88 --> 3101.32]  man's learning it's like spider-man or whatever you play balder's gate with wild magic on and his hands
[3101.32 --> 3106.28]  just like stick to things and he's like ah i can't remove my hand from stuff is luke doing that thing
[3106.28 --> 3111.00]  when you're working from home and you're like on a meeting it's like it just the is he just looping
[3111.00 --> 3117.24]  yeah like is he not even there it's like ai luke can he hear us i don't think he knows that i don't
[3117.24 --> 3123.80]  know what's going on we can here let's indicate that we're talking to him hi luke hello luke can you see us
[3125.64 --> 3131.16]  is he frozen no he's not he's are you sure yeah are we getting i think he's frozen oh no
[3131.16 --> 3141.96]  luke okay are you there oh yeah i think he's okay i think he's gonna be okay um what i would say
[3141.96 --> 3149.16]  the biggest challenge is managing the bursty productivity yeah and i mean that both for myself
[3149.16 --> 3157.16]  and for unnamed people on our team who also are somewhat neurodivergent um because you'll run into a
[3157.16 --> 3165.00]  situation where um and like back when i was a much more integral part of the video pre-production
[3165.00 --> 3171.72]  timeline or pipeline um i would have i would have this issue right where two out of the five days of
[3171.72 --> 3178.60]  the work week i would get like realistically everything done and then the other three i'd be
[3178.60 --> 3184.84]  all over the place right um but but what's really ah but but on the other hand it can also be like kind of
[3184.84 --> 3189.80]  a superpower during those times because it's like this endless fountain of creativity and you can
[3189.80 --> 3194.60]  kind of push a bunch of little projects going and kind of start a bunch of little fires and see what
[3194.60 --> 3199.88]  burns and then and then you can like hyper focus and finish the other ones but then also getting
[3199.88 --> 3206.52]  something finished finished is really hard oh man i see i have so many things like i feel like i want to
[3206.52 --> 3213.56]  say because like in my world i i've noticed since becoming starting medication for this condition
[3213.56 --> 3217.96]  has been an interesting experience because like i feel like i start way more things than i used to
[3217.96 --> 3224.28]  before i would get the like procrastination of i don't know if i can do this so i'm just not even
[3224.28 --> 3230.84]  going to start i i fail before i even get there that way i can't fail because i just never tried right so now
[3230.84 --> 3235.72]  i try and i start doing something and then oh man i feel like i probably have can just show a photo of
[3235.72 --> 3242.52]  this my desk i'll just maybe i'll just show you um yeah i can probably just show that on the show right
[3242.52 --> 3246.44]  yeah you can just send it to dan see that can i just like hold it in front of the camera no you
[3246.44 --> 3251.88]  got to send it to dan how do i send it to you dan teams teams oh gross okay luke luke should be back
[3251.88 --> 3257.80]  now see if you can are you back yes nice hey welcome back send it this is going to happen again
[3257.80 --> 3263.64]  just as a warning it's not my fault hopefully we can recover faster next time yeah now we know okay i
[3263.64 --> 3269.24]  sent you a photo dan hopefully there's nothing incriminating in there i will oh lordy it's fun it's like my
[3269.24 --> 3274.12]  desk there's yeah that's okay nothing important's ever leaked on when before um wait is there anything
[3274.12 --> 3280.28]  nda on here no i think it's probably fine i think it's fine there's a couple 3d printers it's a vibe
[3280.28 --> 3287.96]  you'll get the vibe immediately though whoop there you go okay so this was my office yesterday nice
[3288.52 --> 3293.48]  you can see oh no you didn't get into like a cleaning frenzy zone did you oh yeah i did i did i
[3293.48 --> 3297.96]  cleaned my i'll show you the after photo yeah no i see i knew the second i saw that you put it away
[3297.96 --> 3303.40]  i was going to describe things okay the second i saw that i was like you did the thing you were up
[3303.40 --> 3308.44]  late tidying weren't you no no actually it was during jake tidy it was the lights were still on as you can
[3308.44 --> 3312.92]  see you see this thing right here is that like a dad joke bell yeah is it a real bell yeah yeah that's
[3312.92 --> 3318.12]  impressive it gives him dopamine how did you like adhd oh because you like amazon ordered it while we're on
[3318.12 --> 3324.20]  the show uh that right there that black thing is like a dry box for the 3d printer that's down here
[3324.20 --> 3330.44]  nice i printed it before that i had the 3d printer it is still sitting in parts on my desk now it is
[3330.44 --> 3334.84]  sitting in parts beside the 3d printer ready to go for something i will never put together nice the
[3334.84 --> 3341.32]  prusa xl on the other side i 3d printed an enclosure for it uh nice the plexiglass i ordered from china is
[3341.32 --> 3345.88]  sitting uh in my closet and so are the rest of the parts for the enclosure that i will definitely put
[3345.88 --> 3350.84]  together at some point those bins they're all supposed to like on the bottom the filament
[3350.84 --> 3354.12]  stores they're all supposed to have like little things in it to like pass the filament through
[3354.12 --> 3358.92]  they don't i've had them for like two years so these are all things i've started if you could see
[3358.92 --> 3364.76]  under the pile there's like a bmw manual clutch pedal i was gonna make a short throw one i feel like
[3364.76 --> 3371.24]  this was legit i 3d scanned it this is adhd though this could very well be my workspace i love that you
[3371.24 --> 3376.20]  had the intent of having a pegboard wall oh yeah and you have one tool on it yeah yeah yeah it's like
[3376.20 --> 3382.44]  that that is classic yeah that's lower accurate yeah yeah that is classic by the way i think you're
[3382.44 --> 3389.24]  i think your carpool mate is uh waiting for you do you want me to leave right now you're vibing okay cool
[3391.08 --> 3398.12]  speaking of carpool you see the cars up there yeah um all right oh those are tough but anyways it's like
[3398.12 --> 3404.52]  i start more things so that's cool but also i don't finish as many that actually um transitions
[3404.52 --> 3411.00]  us pretty well into something that luke and i need to talk about because the what will happen first will
[3411.00 --> 3418.60]  luke complete final fantasy 6 or will i finish painting my bike race has been heating up hard dude
[3418.60 --> 3425.08]  you've been it was it was a cold war for a long time yeah and now it's guns are blazing dude you
[3425.08 --> 3432.12]  started that before the pie project i'm pretty sure and that took that took ages did that work
[3432.12 --> 3437.64]  i really hope that worked yeah i get to hear it because i'm monitoring differently so i will say this
[3437.64 --> 3442.44]  um our oh do we want to talk about that later why don't we get through merch messages didn't you tell
[3442.44 --> 3448.20]  me it looks it you told me it looks uh well it's complicated okay you know what let's talk about
[3448.20 --> 3453.32]  it now let's talk about it now here we go yes i did i'm sending you a little video sending you a
[3453.32 --> 3457.96]  little video what even is this show anymore is there supposed to be topics i there are topics
[3457.96 --> 3463.64]  there's more than one i'll tell you that have we done topics yet you've did one i think we did one
[3463.64 --> 3468.36]  well you've been talking about power wall and garbage for an hour that's pretty it's not garbage
[3468.36 --> 3472.44]  it's going to be quality i hope it's going to be quality what's the worst that could happen okay
[3472.44 --> 3476.44]  burns down we'll just build another one yeah that's what i was gonna say we'll build new children
[3476.44 --> 3484.20]  that's content um yeah it's fun the cats is what i was concerned about okay so seven of them i got to
[3484.20 --> 3492.28]  the point where all the parts that needed to be pink were pink i had two little drips two little
[3492.28 --> 3497.24]  drips you can show the second one first dan but you know how to fix the drips right well here's the
[3497.24 --> 3505.88]  problem because it's a combination of things because i'm ambitious slash foolhardy sometimes see i don't
[3505.88 --> 3510.92]  have the same issue with not starting things i start things that's yeah yeah not a problem yeah
[3510.92 --> 3516.12]  um but sometimes i start things that are too big can i just say before you continue i know exactly
[3516.12 --> 3519.88]  where you're going to go with this and i'm just i i want to write it down but it's in my brain i just
[3519.88 --> 3523.24]  want you to know that i've acknowledged this i know where this is about to go and i really hope that
[3523.24 --> 3527.16]  it's the same place that okay that was a little early dan go go ahead oh you're doing great though
[3527.16 --> 3531.40]  uh okay okay now i really know where this is going so i have no problem starting things
[3531.40 --> 3538.52]  but sometimes i i am a little too ambitious so it's a combination of that and i think i realistically
[3538.52 --> 3545.40]  probably got some bad advice at some stage in the paint selection process because i ended up with a
[3545.96 --> 3556.92]  let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven anywhere from about an 11 to a 12
[3556.92 --> 3565.96]  layer paint that is a lot of layers yeah so we got two primer one different kinds of primer or the
[3565.96 --> 3573.00]  same primer the same primer yeah okay two of a solid base a white and that is all easy dude getting it
[3573.00 --> 3584.52]  primed and white no problem but i have then after that a candy and candy is tough can you clarify how
[3584.52 --> 3589.64]  many coats are supposed to be on this because about about 11 to 12 for the end okay so this is right
[3589.64 --> 3594.60]  so for the uninitiated some of the complicated paint coats can be like here you throw down a base coat
[3594.60 --> 3599.16]  of a certain color and then a color coat and then you have like a pearl coat and then you have clear
[3599.16 --> 3604.84]  coat or maybe you have tinted clear coat wow there's a lot of stages yeah so so i have this is one of
[3604.84 --> 3610.04]  those so so the four of the like the primer and then the base color four to five realistically to get
[3610.04 --> 3614.60]  really good coverage with the white because it doesn't cover very well once you get it um reduced
[3614.60 --> 3621.48]  for the gun um so that's easy you get a nice even color if i were to just paint my bike white okay and
[3621.48 --> 3631.32]  just clear coat that i would have been done ages ago but the pink the pink candy is a nightmare to get
[3631.32 --> 3637.80]  even and i picked the hardest possible thing to paint with it because if i was doing a hood of a car
[3637.80 --> 3645.24]  that's easy relatively speaking i think you would have a lot of paint people that would also say
[3645.24 --> 3651.32]  a flat surface is easy but also hard sure it's easier to fix the screw-ups that you will inevitably
[3651.32 --> 3658.12]  have a multi-faceted yeah three-dimensional piece with nowhere to freaking hold it and all these
[3658.12 --> 3665.80]  different tiny little surfaces is really hard to get even and uh i finally and wheels yeah i was just
[3665.80 --> 3670.68]  gonna say wait till you try wheels okay i have progress though i have progress on the wheels but
[3670.68 --> 3677.00]  anyway hold on first dan bring up the picture i had two little drips two little drips in the pink
[3677.00 --> 3681.88]  and i actually found a technique to fix them fixing candy you read online and they say it's impossible
[3681.88 --> 3685.80]  and it's basically impossible but i found a technique that actually worked you can kind of see it
[3685.80 --> 3691.00]  in the very bottom right where it was a little bit too big to work on this one but i almost fixed that
[3691.00 --> 3695.32]  spot are you talking about the part where all the paint is missing no no no i'm the very in the very
[3695.32 --> 3700.12]  very bottom right of the gray part which part the i don't know dan could you have a mouse cursor can
[3700.12 --> 3703.88]  you even i'm trying whatever there's a little spot that almost has like kind of a little white
[3703.88 --> 3709.80]  out i think i see it so basically what happened there was we kind of peeled it back and then masked
[3709.80 --> 3714.52]  around and then used like a little airbrush like for doing those like temp tattoos little airbrush
[3714.52 --> 3719.64]  got it on there what was the defect was this like a dust nib oh it was an awful drip i don't
[3719.64 --> 3725.16]  even know where it came from okay yeah so it was like purple like it went on so heavy it was like
[3725.16 --> 3729.64]  purple in that spot so we see so we got it off managed to put that on it wouldn't have looked great
[3730.20 --> 3733.96]  but it would have been passable for the level of quality that i've resigned to at this point and
[3733.96 --> 3740.44]  this is pre clear coat but yeah but when i went to pull the masking tape off it ripped that whole strip
[3740.44 --> 3746.68]  off so um dan do you want to bring up the video that should yeah sure i don't think that was
[3746.68 --> 3752.20]  supposed to happen not even i don't think your paint is bonded very well well i can tell you that
[3752.20 --> 3758.92]  the white is bonded real good to the primer because this is how long it took to get the white off the
[3758.92 --> 3764.52]  primer it doesn't look like anything's coming out oh it's coming out oh yeah you can see it wow it's
[3764.52 --> 3770.92]  really on there on the entire front fairing piece of my bike it took like four and a half hours
[3773.64 --> 3779.08]  so i was at the point where everything was pink coated and then this happened
[3780.52 --> 3787.48]  the good news is this piece is now white needs to be sanded white one more time and then i'm ready
[3787.48 --> 3791.96]  to paint it pink again and i'm not going to get a drip on it this time and jake i figured out wheels
[3791.96 --> 3799.24]  what do you mean my wheels look like butt right now yeah so i'm re-white coating them but we finally
[3799.24 --> 3805.16]  found a technique so in order to get the candy on there even we made this dan you can move that who
[3805.16 --> 3810.92]  is we uh yvonne's been helping me a little bit oh so we roped her into this yeah we took my drill
[3810.92 --> 3815.56]  and then we took a bunch of rolls of tape like small ones that fit in the big ones yeah and basically
[3815.56 --> 3823.24]  made like a like a spinny wheel on it and so she basically watches for a landmark as it turns around
[3823.24 --> 3828.52]  and is like okay three two one go and i start spraying and then she's like okay three two one go
[3829.16 --> 3834.44]  and i move it off and it's like this is spinning the wheel yeah while she's while she's spinning it
[3834.44 --> 3838.84]  with the drill with like a big like tape roll thing on it so i actually 3d printed a thing recently
[3838.84 --> 3844.04]  because i bought new wheels of course yeah um to because i wanted to ceramic course to both of
[3844.04 --> 3848.60]  those yeah yeah yeah so i 3d printed a thing so i could spin the wheel while i was ceramic coating it
[3848.60 --> 3855.24]  and then proceeded to not use it i just i just i have it if you're only doing a solid color it doesn't
[3855.24 --> 3862.04]  matter it's not that hard but if you are if you're doing a candy and i'm not even going for the whole
[3862.04 --> 3867.32]  thing one solid candy so i'm doing a pink stripe you know they make like candy powder coating too
[3867.32 --> 3872.76]  right yeah well i didn't do that and it would have been stronger and cheaper and they wouldn't have
[3872.76 --> 3878.20]  matched though what all if you did all of them yeah but it's not just the candy there's the two
[3878.20 --> 3882.44]  layers of candy and then there's the two layers of pearl yeah well it wouldn't have been the exact
[3882.44 --> 3887.40]  same thing but it would have been pretty nice it probably would have been better overall to be honest
[3887.40 --> 3892.68]  this is great also beltrick says just pay a professional mr millionaire that is not the
[3892.68 --> 3899.24]  point what would i even do if i just paid people to do things what would i do what would i comment
[3899.24 --> 3906.12]  bothered so many people i responded to it somebody else in chat responded to it you responded to it
[3906.12 --> 3911.64]  we're all just like what no that is not the point so is the point that you should have just left it
[3911.64 --> 3919.64]  uh oh just like left it silver no well left oh i 100 should have done that the drip um could you not
[3919.64 --> 3925.56]  because like i've i've seen people do drip repairs before i've seen techniques where they like fill the
[3925.56 --> 3930.44]  surround with bondo and then sand it down so that you're sanding down the bondo on the outside and not
[3930.44 --> 3934.92]  ruining the rest of it i've seen techniques where they like just strip everything down and do it again
[3934.92 --> 3940.12]  i've seen it where they cut it with a knife right so i basically did the knife thing um but the only issue
[3940.12 --> 3945.64]  is that when i peeled it up it it hadn't cured enough yet yeah it was it was too fresh that was
[3945.64 --> 3952.52]  bare metal was it because i no no that was primer oh so i i did the same thing on my tank and the tank
[3952.52 --> 3958.52]  worked did you actually can't find the spot on the tank did you not like sand enough between the primer
[3958.52 --> 3966.92]  and the top coat so uh let's see that was on the um was it too long between too little between i think
[3966.92 --> 3972.60]  it could have been too long between the primer coat but i think it was just mostly that it hadn't
[3972.60 --> 3980.60]  been long enough since i did the um since i did the pink on the white well when this is done i think
[3980.60 --> 3985.80]  it would be really fun for us to polish it oh god i want to i want like i want you and me we should
[3985.80 --> 3990.76]  polish it no we should it'll be fun it'll make it look so much better dude you have to polish it
[3990.76 --> 3995.32]  after otherwise just not gonna look good you're gonna get rid of all the dust nibs and stuff yeah yeah i like i
[3995.32 --> 3998.76]  actually do you actually need to yeah that's gonna look like crap that's like requirement even
[3998.76 --> 4004.28]  if you clear coat it yeah i mean usually when a body shop polishes stuff after they paint it it looks
[4004.28 --> 4013.32]  like crap like we fix so many like body shop tried to polish a car oh yeah i have enough so many i have
[4013.32 --> 4019.88]  enough hours in this project that for you to say anything that sounds anything like more hours is just
[4019.88 --> 4024.92]  gonna make me instantly recoil it'll only take a couple days you should right now just put everything
[4024.92 --> 4030.44]  in a bin and go to a powder coating shop that'll solve your problems that's what i'm gonna do with
[4030.44 --> 4035.40]  my wheels i'm not gonna bother can you powder coat plastic uh i don't know i'm not aware of that i mean
[4035.40 --> 4040.04]  that piece you were looking at was plastic so yeah you gotta have you tried candy i should probably
[4040.04 --> 4044.84]  that's that's oh okay that's that's part of the nightmare of painting a bike is that i have steel
[4044.84 --> 4049.48]  pieces aluminum pieces and plastic pieces and they're gonna be seven different colors
[4050.68 --> 4054.60]  even though he painted apparently traditional powder coating does not work on plastic i think
[4054.60 --> 4060.12]  yeah it would melt you have to bake it i think i've seen yeah plastic fancy plastic powder coat stuff
[4060.12 --> 4064.60]  yeah i'm sure i do there's enough material science these days i'm sure somebody figured something out
[4064.60 --> 4070.60]  anyway specialized industrial methods seem to something something whatever yeah powder coating is cool
[4070.60 --> 4077.96]  though anyways goodbye okay drive safe see you later luke bye see you linus i guess yeah he he never
[4077.96 --> 4084.04]  acknowledges me when i tell him to drive safe oh no i usually say i won't i also say the same thing to
[4084.04 --> 4093.08]  my mom and she doesn't like it no she wouldn't neither do i yeah yeah see you later so this time this time
[4093.08 --> 4098.52]  he crosses the camera just on the end you know he figured it out that it's better to just quickly go that
[4098.52 --> 4105.64]  way than to painstakingly make his way across over here uh so i i have updates as well no he's back
[4107.24 --> 4117.56]  oh oh oh geez okay um okay so how's your okay so hold on i should probably give the update so all but that
[4117.56 --> 4126.12]  piece that need to be pink are pink but they still need two more pearl coats and then two to three clear
[4126.12 --> 4132.84]  coats before i can actually like drop anything off for reassembly with the shop so you definitely can't
[4132.84 --> 4140.92]  finish before 2 a.m are you going to be done today no but you're going to be leaving the country oh and
[4140.92 --> 4150.04]  thus away from your bike uh yes and luckily my project is portable yeah okay all right how many how
[4150.04 --> 4157.40]  many of the party have you reassembled in the world of ruin i'm in the world of ruin okay but just
[4157.40 --> 4163.80]  barely oh um but i still think i still think i'm gonna beat you i still think i'm gonna beat you
[4163.80 --> 4169.88]  okay i still think i'm gonna beat you yeah i the reason why it's not that good is because i also had a
[4169.88 --> 4179.88]  progress issue oh no i lost a save oh what how did you lose a save you're playing on steam i genuinely
[4181.88 --> 4188.28]  i have no idea what how much something something happened with quite a bit something happened with
[4188.28 --> 4196.28]  cloud sync um i i like i you know i pre-installed it on my laptop i don't know maybe i don't know i
[4196.28 --> 4201.96]  pre-installed it on my laptop um because i knew a fair amount of play time while i was on this trip
[4201.96 --> 4209.48]  was going to be offline this is final fantasy 6 uh because as little inflate plane chat so i yeah i
[4209.48 --> 4216.12]  installed it like at my house ahead of time cloud synced everything before i left and then on the plane
[4216.12 --> 4217.72]  i loaded it up and it was like
[4220.28 --> 4225.00]  way earlier than where i was like like many hours lost oh no
[4225.00 --> 4233.24]  um which usually like i have quit games over that before like just fully just whatever i'm
[4233.24 --> 4239.08]  done it's like no forget it i'm out yeah that's it but this is a a challenge a competition of sorts
[4239.08 --> 4246.28]  i almost quit final fantasy tactics over an issue like that um yeah i've done this many times yeah i got
[4246.28 --> 4254.92]  to the i got to the notorious fight where um if you don't happen to build ramza correctly you literally
[4254.92 --> 4262.12]  can't win it and i i ended up i thought i had lost like 10 hours but i had only lost like
[4262.12 --> 4269.32]  three or four so i i so i stuck it out but i was so mad i was so mad i think we've every gamer has
[4269.32 --> 4277.00]  probably felt that and it's just like the rage to how much this matters ratio is probably the highest
[4277.00 --> 4280.36]  out of anything that i've ever experienced because at the end of the day it's a video game oh
[4280.36 --> 4289.08]  it's so it doesn't matter at all but the rage is so high so that was that was me like
[4290.20 --> 4295.48]  probably an hour into my flight because i didn't pull out the laptop immediately you know i kind of
[4295.48 --> 4302.12]  got settled you have to wait for the the belt thingy to the the buckle thingy to the light to
[4302.12 --> 4306.44]  go off all that kind of stuff i finally get the laptop i load it up and i just stare at it for a while
[4307.08 --> 4312.84]  thinking like there's got to be some way to fix this right and like obviously no um livin says just
[4312.84 --> 4328.44]  grind to level erith she'll be great later in the game um yeah so yeah so i i i pushed really hard i was
[4328.44 --> 4332.20]  for for for some context it went so far back i had no espers
[4336.04 --> 4341.88]  like i lost multiple saves worth and i don't understand what at all what happened oh that's
[4341.88 --> 4349.80]  wild like i i i don't know but that's on that one flight ago on the one flight because i've now
[4349.80 --> 4357.00]  i've done this so now i know what i'm doing i know where i'm going those types of things i realized
[4357.00 --> 4366.12]  that uh the some of the things in the game are very weird um like some of sabin's stuff scale off of
[4366.12 --> 4371.64]  magic even though he's like a martial arts guy and stuff like that oh yeah things things are just kind
[4371.64 --> 4379.08]  of odd but now i know those things so i just got into like a way more experienced run then go mode
[4379.08 --> 4386.20]  and i i got to past where i was before on the one flight which is like wildly compressed before uh
[4386.20 --> 4395.88]  compared to before um and i'm i'm kind of flying i'm much more knowledgeable now on like you know
[4395.88 --> 4400.20]  checking for weaknesses and hitting things with the right magic and stuff like that so like the
[4400.84 --> 4409.48]  the fight to get to the floating continent um just blitzed through it oh it was ridiculous yeah
[4410.20 --> 4414.28]  it ended up being so easy like i i think you commented last time we talked about this you
[4414.28 --> 4419.64]  commented about how the pixel remaster is too easy i think you said yeah um i get to that fight with
[4419.64 --> 4427.80]  ultross and whatever his big buddy is whatever yeah something yeah or something um i i think i like
[4427.80 --> 4435.72]  two shot ultross like just okay so you're like you're like super overpowered now then i'm jacked
[4438.20 --> 4443.24]  and like i'm doing better about like making sure that i'm min-maxing okay having the right esper on the
[4443.24 --> 4447.72]  right person when they level up to gain the bonus how many characters do you have in the world of ruin
[4447.72 --> 4456.84]  oh no key suggested a poll dan do it do it uh whether luke will finish final fantasy 6 or i will
[4456.84 --> 4461.56]  finish painting the sv650 sure give me one second now hold on a second hold on we got to define
[4461.56 --> 4468.04]  completion here is luke allowed to like look up guides when he gets to the world of ruin or does he
[4468.04 --> 4477.32]  use the paper manual i think paper manual is all i had when i was a kid
[4478.12 --> 4483.40]  i feel like it's got to be paper but you're getting help from avon not much for what it's worth
[4485.64 --> 4491.96]  and i'm there working on it every time i will say i am completely down with whatever judgment comes
[4491.96 --> 4497.08]  here okay and i am totally fine with paper man honestly no let's do paper manual is my completion
[4497.08 --> 4500.84]  complete when i finish painting it or when the shop assembles the bike
[4500.84 --> 4508.52]  i feel like when are you gonna let your beard grow out when i'm done painting
[4508.52 --> 4513.72]  when the not when the shop finishes assembly no no no i'll do when i'm done when i'm done painting
[4513.72 --> 4521.56]  i'm done like i don't need the mask anymore then personally i think it's paint okay i'm making this
[4521.56 --> 4525.16]  harder for myself i'm saying paper manual and you can just finish when you're painting but i think
[4525.16 --> 4530.36]  both of those things make sense as much as i'm some people are saying they think i should be okay just
[4530.36 --> 4537.08]  for to catch you guys up the the the bet is whether luke will finish final fantasy 6 a game that i've
[4537.08 --> 4541.56]  been bugging him to play basically since we met because it was like my favorite childhood game even
[4541.56 --> 4547.48]  though i have realized in also playing through the pixel remaster at the same time as him because i got
[4547.48 --> 4551.56]  it in my head at some point that i was going to be super ambitious and both finish final fantasy 6
[4551.56 --> 4556.76]  and paint my bike in the time it took him to finish it anyway that's not happening um or if i will
[4556.76 --> 4561.40]  i will finish painting my motorcycle which has been an ongoing project for i think about two years now
[4565.32 --> 4571.00]  okay i'm gonna look at the results i'm ready to see the results i'm kind of afraid to look at the
[4571.00 --> 4582.20]  results uh okay i'm looking at the results who will finish first come on move it over sorry sorry i'll
[4582.20 --> 4586.68]  move it i'll move it normally with this question you think it'd be the other way around but 80
[4586.68 --> 4596.68]  wow three kids buddy three kids yeah exactly
[4600.28 --> 4603.80]  uh get that other pull out of there we all know they all use firefox
[4603.80 --> 4612.12]  well you know what you know what haters i'm gonna go home tonight and i'm gonna pack and
[4612.12 --> 4618.84]  i'm gonna do some sanding yeah sure you are how how much because i know i have time to do
[4620.84 --> 4628.28]  no way when honestly when the when the ship flying thing was happening when i was getting to the floating
[4628.28 --> 4630.68]  continent yeah i thought the game was ending
[4633.56 --> 4635.00]  is this your first final fantasy
[4637.40 --> 4645.16]  uh i mean i suppose you imagine that the final boss only has two phases right yeah i have no idea
[4645.80 --> 4651.96]  the only other final fantasy i've played through is eight and with eight i played it through on pc so
[4651.96 --> 4657.88]  you had all the discs so you kind of knew right like there's more content coming right um
[4658.84 --> 4669.40]  when when when i when i hit floating continent i was like oh okay um i guess there's more to this
[4670.28 --> 4680.52]  there's a lot more to it yeah i i kind of got that vibe um i also started kind of mulling over like
[4680.52 --> 4686.36]  all right well there's like a level cap and stuff that my level is not very high um i don't know if you're
[4686.36 --> 4690.60]  expected to hit the level cap because i'm like i don't know like pokemon you're not at all okay
[4690.60 --> 4697.48]  cool yeah no not even a little um um do you remember what the stakes are of this bet no keys asking
[4698.52 --> 4704.36]  are there stakes i don't even remember so it was so long ago that i literally cannot remember the
[4704.36 --> 4709.64]  circumstances of us making this bet i don't think there was it was just sort of like honor
[4709.64 --> 4715.56]  don't underestimate how hard we will try it was a friendly handshake yeah kind of bragging rights
[4715.56 --> 4722.04]  type of thing yeah yeah i don't honestly i got so focused on zeus says maybe we should vote again
[4722.04 --> 4726.44]  after hearing you talk about how you thought the game was over and you're at the halfway mark
[4726.44 --> 4732.52]  well i'm not looking stuff up i'm trying to like and honestly uh it it hit a lull there
[4733.16 --> 4738.84]  the last time i was playing yeah um it's cooking again the game's fun again right now uh how many
[4738.84 --> 4746.44]  characters do you have in the world of ruin i'd have to load it up okay you have more than one though
[4747.08 --> 4753.08]  do you have yeah do you have tara yeah yeah oh okay you're okay you're moving pretty good then he's
[4753.08 --> 4760.68]  he's moving pretty good boys i will say that i definitely hit a lull again to the point where i
[4760.68 --> 4768.84]  just like haven't played it again after where you are oh yeah okay with most of the game this long
[4769.48 --> 4774.60]  it's such a game this long it it makes sense that there'd be multiple lull points the the only thing
[4774.60 --> 4781.56]  i'm not really enjoying right now is that it it feels like it has a man it's a great game i need to be
[4781.56 --> 4786.04]  very clear about that before i complain about anything it's fantastic but if if if if i played
[4786.04 --> 4791.00]  this game at like the same time that you did this would probably be in my like top three all time i'm
[4791.00 --> 4797.32]  not even i'm not surprised it is good um it hasn't aged perfectly yeah and i think one of the things
[4797.32 --> 4803.24]  that has made it not aged perfectly is it came from an era where people would like in a review of a
[4803.24 --> 4809.24]  game people would include the estimated completion time and if it was too short they'd complain people
[4809.24 --> 4815.72]  would rate it lowly and you know what which was dumb dude that is something we never touch on
[4815.72 --> 4824.28]  when we discuss the cost of games over time because back when we were buying games for 60 70 us dollars
[4824.84 --> 4833.00]  but it was the mid 90s games were expensive like i don't think i knew anyone as a kid who had more
[4833.00 --> 4837.48]  than like half a dozen games in their library for a given console so your game needed to be long so
[4837.48 --> 4843.16]  you could get a lot of value by the time you had five games you had literally spent more than you
[4843.16 --> 4850.28]  spent on the console and controllers on the game titles right like that was the dynamic whereas now
[4850.28 --> 4855.32]  we treat games like they're just disposable you know like oh yeah i tried that game i didn't really
[4855.32 --> 4861.56]  like it i like i played it for too long to get a steam refund so like whatever but it was eight
[4861.56 --> 4866.44]  dollars in the steam summer sale so who cares you know yeah it's a totally different mentality
[4867.00 --> 4871.00]  yeah like having more than four or five games was pretty surprising because remember people would do a
[4871.00 --> 4875.80]  lot of trade-ins and stuff back then too because things are so expensive oh no or you you trade with
[4875.80 --> 4883.56]  your buddies or whatever people say you'll love expedition 33 yeah i i i'm not gonna play it right now
[4883.56 --> 4889.08]  because i need to finish fantasy six but i i wish listed it because it looks really cool yeah i think
[4889.08 --> 4897.88]  you got time luke i um i haven't i haven't finished rewriting the wheels yet after i do that i have to
[4897.88 --> 4904.76]  pink the wheels after i do that i have to mask the wheels then i have to black them then i have to clear
[4904.76 --> 4911.80]  coat them and i was i was legitimately worried you're going to be done on this show dude he has to start
[4911.80 --> 4919.08]  again dude no and and the scariest part of the whole thing is still coming because the frame which
[4919.08 --> 4925.56]  i did pink ages ago i never did the pearl on so it's been sitting there for about a year
[4926.36 --> 4933.96]  with just pink on it so i have to clean it i have to tack cloth it and then i have to oh my god i hope
[4933.96 --> 4941.00]  i succeed at this do my very first pearl coat i haven't purled anything yet so there's plenty of time
[4941.00 --> 4946.92]  for me to screw up and have to go back to square one on any number of different parts like i am
[4947.64 --> 4950.84]  i am many many many hours from completion on this
[4952.36 --> 4957.08]  oh yeah i pull it just about the one thing i'm kind of noticing is just the
[4960.12 --> 4966.76]  the kind of like hey i gained 15 points in the polls though sorry i'm listening the the time wastey bits um
[4966.76 --> 4975.16]  oh the grind the grind and i mean that's that's a classic you're coming up on some grindtastic parts
[4975.16 --> 4981.80]  i'll tell you that much like gotcha okay some of the spells that have like 1x growth rate and stuff
[4981.80 --> 4993.72]  oh um and like being a little bit more intentional about like trying to actually use the espers to
[4993.72 --> 5000.20]  learn spells okay and back to the completion thing does he have to get the whole party together
[5001.56 --> 5007.40]  and i'm not even talking about like optional characters like gogo and numaro i'm talking does he
[5007.40 --> 5014.84]  have to get the world of balance cast back together or can he just like try to take on kefka's tower with
[5014.84 --> 5022.28]  like eight people are saying any percent they say any percent you can do whatever you want almost
[5022.28 --> 5028.04]  everybody's saying no or any percent but interesting to be there's no way luth's gonna play a game like
[5028.04 --> 5032.12]  that that's hilarious there's i know this man too well i already knew the answer before i asked the
[5032.12 --> 5038.76]  question there's absolutely no way no shot what was the answer there's no way you're not gonna get
[5038.76 --> 5044.28]  the whole team back together there's just no way i was gonna say i'm probably gonna do it anyway
[5045.80 --> 5050.68]  a huge part of what makes this game so special is the ensemble cast and you kind of get attached to
[5050.68 --> 5055.16]  them he's not gonna not go yeah go get f***ing shadow like you gotta be kidding me you saved shadow
[5055.16 --> 5063.32]  right of course oh good i thought he was gonna say who yeah oh no no no no no oh that's so funny i got
[5063.32 --> 5071.96]  a little freaked out about it i i i did i did do a little worried save yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because
[5071.96 --> 5078.52]  i was like i don't know if this like he might actually just die uh but i'm happy that he he doesn't
[5078.52 --> 5087.00]  uh yeah um so i found i'm gonna i'm i i'm the whole chat said any percent or no but honestly i'm
[5087.00 --> 5091.96]  i'm gonna go get everyone so it doesn't really make a difference for me because i'm planning on
[5091.96 --> 5096.28]  trying to get everybody i didn't actually that was a my i don't care to be clear but that's a minor
[5096.28 --> 5102.20]  spoiler because i didn't know if everyone was okay um we should probably do sponsors dan's had to sign
[5102.20 --> 5108.20]  up for like 40 minutes yeah we're just about in wine after dark actually everyone knows i love sandals
[5108.20 --> 5114.36]  but they just can't offer the same functionality as our sponsor vessi their shoes are breathable

[5278.20 --> 5286.04]  talked about the vpn firm that canceled lifetime subscriptions because and i quote they didn't know about them
[5286.76 --> 5292.60]  this is amazing sources ars technica i my jaw just about hit the floor when i was reading this
[5292.60 --> 5301.32]  in march of this year vpn secure customers began complaining online about lifetime subscriptions no
[5301.32 --> 5308.44]  longer working lifetime subscription holders then began receiving emails that stated lifetime deal
[5308.44 --> 5316.44]  accounts had been deactivated as of april 28th an email posted on reddit notes that vpn secure has been
[5316.44 --> 5325.32]  acquired by new ownership in 2023 in an asset only deal so this new owner acquired the technology domain
[5325.32 --> 5329.72]  and customer database but not the liabilities that is a direct quote
[5333.64 --> 5343.64]  what glorious the new ownership claims that the previous owner did not disclose that thousands of ltds
[5343.64 --> 5349.40]  or lifetime deals had been sold through platforms like stack social and they stated that they only
[5349.40 --> 5354.84]  discovered the lifetime deal accounts months later after finding that their resources were being strained
[5354.84 --> 5365.64]  by ltd customers who provided no sustaining income to the service too bad that when you acquire a company
[5366.52 --> 5373.24]  okay hold on vpn secure sent out an additional email this week reiterating that the acquisition was an
[5373.24 --> 5379.72]  asset only deal don't you understand it was an asset only deal and after we reviewed six to
[5379.72 --> 5384.92]  twelve months of vpn secure's previous financials before the purchase the listing profit and loss statements
[5384.92 --> 5391.96]  and communications never mentioned these lifetime deals yeah but you see the p and l deal if you see the profit and
[5391.96 --> 5397.96]  loss then what are we even talking about here if it was an asset only deal it should have quite literally
[5398.68 --> 5405.80]  canceled all subscriptions well yeah then they should have no you can't have it both ways you can't have
[5405.80 --> 5410.60]  the monthly subscriptions but not the lifetime you don't get to pick which customers you acquired
[5412.12 --> 5419.40]  vpn secure has offered affected users discounted new subscriptions of a dollar 87 a month instead of
[5419.40 --> 5427.88]  9.95 19 for a year instead of 80 or 55 for three years instead of 107 until the end of may here's a
[5427.88 --> 5434.84]  suggestion how about you not buy anything from a company that treats you so disrespectfully
[5436.28 --> 5443.48]  there's an idea and i'm not even going to poison this segment by mentioning another vpn that you could
[5443.48 --> 5449.24]  sign up for because that is not the point right now the point right now is don't give them a dime
[5450.76 --> 5458.20]  not one penny if you weren't worth it to them as a customer who by the way already paid for the service
[5458.20 --> 5464.76]  then you aren't worth it to them as a customer period that's how this works since march there have
[5464.76 --> 5470.76]  apparently been 20 pages of one star reviews on trustpilot and vpn secure is responding on trustpilot
[5470.76 --> 5477.88]  acknowledging it could have communicated better with customers no no what you could have done is not
[5478.60 --> 5479.80]  renege on a deal
[5482.68 --> 5488.76]  yeah i don't think there's a way to communicate this better um i think i'm going to be pissed anyways
[5488.76 --> 5490.36]  and it also says like
[5493.00 --> 5498.20]  despite not assuming the previous company's contracts or payments like that doesn't sound right they had
[5498.20 --> 5504.36]  the monthlies right as far as i know the new ownership says they kept the lifetime accounts
[5504.36 --> 5508.84]  active for two years as a gesture of goodwill no they didn't notice it you didn't know they made it
[5508.84 --> 5513.56]  very clear they didn't notice it and then their third message claims the new owners didn't gain
[5513.56 --> 5518.76]  access to the customer database for months after the acquisition dude i i'm sorry i just don't feel bad
[5518.76 --> 5529.32]  for you that's i i'm sorry i there's no there is absolutely no right answer here i'm afraid
[5529.32 --> 5537.64]  other than incredibly low cost of vpn users was worth the 20 pages and hopefully and probably more one
[5537.64 --> 5545.64]  star reviews you're having now idiots who's f1 says luke would you sue the company if you had a lifetime sub
[5545.64 --> 5559.72]  uh come on we all know the answer no yeah it's so much work and it's probably so expensive
[5560.60 --> 5566.76]  yeah basically and it's like i think that's something that a lot of people don't necessarily
[5566.76 --> 5573.80]  consider is that it's really easy to make a video about how you're suing someone or whatever
[5573.80 --> 5580.04]  actually following through on it like to the point where there's an actual judgment and or
[5580.04 --> 5586.92]  settlement of some sort that's like it's it's a ton of work and it's boring no one's interested
[5586.92 --> 5593.32]  in it it's not content anymore only the initial announcement you know the big bombshell is content
[5593.32 --> 5597.48]  nothing else is content so it's just gonna die um
[5597.48 --> 5605.16]  um and it's just it and it's like you gotta you gotta weigh the cost benefit right like what is luke
[5605.16 --> 5611.72]  owed dozens of dollars what's it gonna cost to have even an exploratory call with a lawyer
[5613.64 --> 5619.72]  come on yeah if somebody already set up a class action lawsuit people people are asking if i would
[5619.72 --> 5626.20]  join that and it's like even then man like what am i gonna get from it like if i'm gonna click one button
[5628.44 --> 5633.00]  i don't know sure i think the the honestly the biggest impact thing that i could do
[5633.88 --> 5641.40]  is to obviously never bring them my business again go somewhere else leave that one star review and try
[5641.40 --> 5648.28]  to get as many other people to do the same because if they have one star reviews everywhere like if it's
[5648.28 --> 5654.12]  if like you know there's trust pilot but if they also have one star reviews on i'm assuming they're on
[5654.12 --> 5659.32]  the app stores and everything else if they have just one star reviews everywhere then that's it
[5659.32 --> 5666.20]  unless they do a major rebrand which is going to cost them a huge amount of money um and kind of ruin
[5666.20 --> 5669.64]  a huge part of the reason why they bought this company anyways um
[5672.92 --> 5678.92]  they're just like screwed there's so many vpns out there people aren't going to just go to the
[5678.92 --> 5686.76]  the the one star one constantly um so people are talking about small claims court i can't speak
[5686.76 --> 5692.92]  to every other jurisdiction but small claims court here is intended for like local defendants
[5693.80 --> 5700.84]  like i i can't take some like israeli or you know chinese company to small claims court like that
[5700.84 --> 5708.60]  come on they they would have under what authority am i going to summon them to the courthouse like that
[5708.60 --> 5717.24]  that's the thing right like it it's not happening um anyway someone says in the us you can okay well
[5717.24 --> 5724.44]  that's great and i wish you luck with that um but yeah here it's woefully impractical
[5724.44 --> 5731.00]  yeah yeah i don't know the nice voice crack i don't know the uh the country lines thing like
[5731.00 --> 5739.64]  we're only could be aware of our our local stuff and even then barely if i'm being completely honest
[5739.64 --> 5743.96]  inception boy says if they don't show up then the judge sides with you in small claims court yeah
[5743.96 --> 5751.80]  that's nice but so what how am i going to actually get anything from them is is the judge also going
[5751.80 --> 5757.96]  to like get on a plane and go to their headquarters and like rough them up if they don't pay it definitely
[5757.96 --> 5767.48]  going to go get my yeah what are we it's not it's not actually that simple to actually get the money
[5767.48 --> 5778.84]  out of someone that supposedly has lost in small claims court um all right what else what else we got
[5778.84 --> 5788.36]  this week do we want to talk about some good news yeah this is so cool uh here i'm gonna i'm gonna fire
[5788.36 --> 5798.52]  up the promo that uh phillips did let's go this is like dude how is a company this big doing something
[5798.52 --> 5806.68]  this cool i was stunned to be honest is this this is real this is real that is incredible this is real
[5806.68 --> 5813.16]  fixables dude they partnered with prusa this was the point of 3d printing when it was first like
[5813.16 --> 5820.20]  coming onto the scene like a decade ago dude so you could just like oh my god you could just make
[5820.20 --> 5825.24]  phillips compatible like replacement pieces and adapters and they've got a whole thing like look
[5826.28 --> 5832.20]  dude this is so cool they've got they've got just a freaking prusa in the promo for it it's like
[5832.20 --> 5838.68]  the best news a wan shows ever had right this is genuinely incredibly cool they will have my
[5838.68 --> 5845.08]  business for this reason i yeah 30 years ago yeah dude i don't know anything i okay i don't not know
[5845.08 --> 5851.24]  anything i don't know much about phillips right in in the last you know 10 years what have they done
[5851.24 --> 5858.68]  that's been on my radar they have overpriced light bulbs um i don't know they have like oh we use them
[5858.68 --> 5864.76]  here the the ranset has the phillips hue sure right but like like have they done anything
[5865.48 --> 5870.92]  that has even remotely seemed this cool that has shown up on your guys's radar in the last decade
[5873.40 --> 5879.24]  definitely not but i don't think anyone in the spaces that phillips operates in has
[5879.24 --> 5884.20]  either to defend them a little oh no no i'm not attacking them i'm not attacking them i'm just
[5884.20 --> 5889.16]  i'm just making it clear for other people they they do a lot of healthcare stuff dude this came
[5889.72 --> 5898.60]  completely out of nowhere for me oh me too and i was just so i was so excited to see this that i just
[5898.60 --> 5903.00]  didn't i don't i don't really know what else to say other than this is super cool so they've teamed up
[5903.00 --> 5908.92]  with prusa research to launch phillips fixables aiming to encourage self-repair of phillips products
[5908.92 --> 5914.36]  using 3d printed replacement components which will be available on printables.com phillips will
[5914.36 --> 5920.20]  include recommended print settings to ensure that your 3d printed parts are sturdy enough to be a
[5920.20 --> 5924.60]  long-term solution and there's only one design so far but the website and promo videos show additional
[5924.60 --> 5930.36]  3d printed parts for phillips grooming products and users are able to submit requests for specific parts
[5930.36 --> 5938.04]  if they're not already available so it's baby steps right now that's sick in the infancy but right now
[5938.92 --> 5945.32]  if this is what it seems to be on the surface i am so amped and this is enough for to significantly
[5945.32 --> 5952.04]  sway my purchase decisions between like a phillips something or an oral b that thing or you know a
[5952.04 --> 5957.72]  norelco shaver or a phillips shaver like i am you know i'm so in same here so in same here you know
[5957.72 --> 5961.88]  what's interesting is people are talking about how apparently it's like trending on thingiverse or
[5961.88 --> 5970.12]  whatever already um i i i wonder if this could be an interesting way to inform um like
[5972.04 --> 5978.92]  product development uh because if you see that one part oh in comparison to all the other ones that
[5978.92 --> 5984.20]  you're you're offering if they don't mind this really often they're crazy yeah you're like wow this one
[5984.20 --> 5988.28]  part seems to be breaking a lot let's let's re-engineer that a little bit on the next model and make it
[5988.28 --> 5996.52]  better or like everyone and their dog prints uh a number five and a half you know uh uh buzz cut
[5996.52 --> 6003.24]  we should add that that should be in the standard kit you know dude that this is this is cash money
[6003.24 --> 6008.76]  or i hope it is that's so killer this kind of behavior should absolutely be rewarded it will affect
[6008.76 --> 6013.32]  my purchase decisions easily if there's a phillips equivalent to something else i'm reaching for the
[6013.32 --> 6018.60]  phillips panda says phillips is norelco law okay well fine branding works then i guess they've
[6018.60 --> 6024.12]  indoctrinated me um someone in full plane chat also said that they're in the market for a new beard
[6024.12 --> 6028.28]  trimmer and they're going to get a phillips one now because of it this is like this is where you know
[6028.28 --> 6035.48]  voting with your wallet works both ways right yeah and i hate how often it has to be like a negative
[6035.48 --> 6041.32]  message this is this is exciting this is an opportunity for us to support this personally send a
[6041.32 --> 6046.36]  positive message like gives me hope for the future i was actually um i went as far as ordering the
[6046.36 --> 6052.12]  replacement battery for my um my electric toothbrush i think it's a i want to say it's an oral b or
[6052.12 --> 6057.64]  something like that and i was so i was so annoyed to discover how difficult it is to replace the battery
[6057.64 --> 6062.04]  in it but i found out it's possible and then i had like a video title idea in my mind that was like
[6062.60 --> 6068.20]  um my toothbrush shouldn't be this hard to fix and the idea was i was going to do like a handful of
[6068.20 --> 6072.52]  little fixes around the house that were like rejuvenating things and then we did that sponsored
[6072.52 --> 6078.52]  thing with um what's their nuts uh uh life and or something like that and i started using that
[6078.52 --> 6082.20]  toothbrush and then i got distracted by some other shiny video project and then we so we never ended
[6082.20 --> 6090.36]  up doing the video but um having had that experience with that other toothbrush and then seeing phillips's
[6090.36 --> 6096.20]  attitude here there's just absolutely no question that i would consider a brand that built that kind of
[6096.20 --> 6101.40]  impossible to repair ability into their toothbrush anymore i just wouldn't even consider it anymore
[6102.44 --> 6105.08]  yeah um
[6107.80 --> 6113.96]  all right i'm looking them up right now because i'm not i wasn't actually sure of the the brand of my
[6113.96 --> 6119.48]  toothbrush and shaver and it i i guess i'm already in the phillips ecosystem so there's not a ton more i
[6119.48 --> 6129.56]  can do all right let's go uh but but hey they'll have continued um purchases for me i guess over time
[6129.56 --> 6136.52]  well i mean we're in a unique position where there's definitely things that we can do you know yeah yeah
[6136.52 --> 6142.52]  yeah so at least there's that um so you know back to the vpn thing and this you know we could talk about
[6142.52 --> 6148.36]  it on the land show yeah yeah yeah that hopefully makes a difference all right what else what else we
[6148.36 --> 6159.00]  got this week energy star going down i want to talk about podcasters not wanting public play counts
[6160.04 --> 6167.08]  spotify this is funny to me spotify has responded to podcaster backlash over the plays feature that
[6167.08 --> 6173.88]  was announced last week plays was announced as a new publicly visible metric of how many times an
[6173.88 --> 6180.20]  episode of a podcast has been actively watched or listened to rounded to the nearest thousand
[6180.20 --> 6186.12]  spotify said this would help users attract new audiences but podcasters were quick to criticize
[6186.12 --> 6191.88]  the feature with most feeling that plays would give additional promotion to podcasts that already have
[6191.88 --> 6198.92]  large audiences and make small shows less appealing to new listeners spotify announced changes earlier
[6198.92 --> 6206.04]  today updating the program so plays only start to be displayed after 50 000 plays and will only update
[6206.04 --> 6216.12]  at specific milestones instead of being more granular so luke what do you think about this i feel like
[6216.12 --> 6223.40]  their update might be worse uh because because now people are just gonna see look at all the
[6223.40 --> 6233.40]  thousand above yeah discard everything else which is like so bad um wow yeah i i feel like that's like
[6233.40 --> 6240.76]  the worst pivot they could have almost possibly done um i'm not i feel like in a weird way i'm not super
[6240.76 --> 6247.96]  surprised that some podcasters don't want to show the play count uh yeah i have got oh i've got so many
[6247.96 --> 6255.88]  thoughts about that but yes carry on yeah i mean a lot of that comes down to podcast ad rates being like
[6255.88 --> 6263.08]  super super high for some reason compared to any other form of media which i've never understood and
[6263.08 --> 6271.72]  now i'm wondering if it's because play counts are hidden um as far as i can tell the entire model
[6271.72 --> 6281.16]  for podcast advertising which yes to your point commands an astonishing cpm compared to like
[6281.16 --> 6289.56]  compared to video which makes no sense to me absolutely no sense um the only difference as far
[6289.56 --> 6296.28]  as i can tell and the reason that podcasting commands this extremely high rate is that it has this air
[6296.28 --> 6306.44]  of like um exclusivities or not exclusivity but like uh professionalism slash old media that it has somehow
[6306.44 --> 6314.36]  carried over from the radio days and a lot of relationships with radio advertisers moved into the
[6314.36 --> 6323.08]  podcasting space and because it uses a lot of the same bullshit metrics that newspapers and magazines
[6323.08 --> 6331.72]  and radio did to calculate their reach so podcasting advertisers as far as i can tell have just been
[6332.44 --> 6341.88]  bamboozled for years and years and years into paying rates that make absolutely no sense as far as i can tell
[6341.88 --> 6349.96]  like i i have seen the numbers that agencies have floated by us for what they think a podcast that is
[6349.96 --> 6356.52]  equivalently sized to the wan show might be able to bring in and i'm looking at it going like this is more
[6356.52 --> 6368.12]  than we do in adsense sponsor integrations and like merch sales like what what is even what is even going on
[6368.12 --> 6375.56]  right now but it's very very old media the way that the podcasting advertising space works and i guarantee
[6375.56 --> 6383.48]  you the last thing they want is transparency in terms of seeing how many people are actually listening
[6383.48 --> 6389.00]  to any of this and it's it's something that i've tried to it's something i've tried to figure out multiple
[6389.00 --> 6394.84]  times because every once in a while i will have someone reach out and invite me onto their podcast
[6394.84 --> 6400.44]  and one of the things that i will try to figure out is and like look i'm not i'm not trying to be rude
[6400.44 --> 6410.68]  or anything but is this a real podcast you know or is this just like a dude and his friend who bought a
[6410.68 --> 6416.20]  snowball and this is like their first episode like that happens i'm trying to do i'm trying to do a little
[6416.20 --> 6424.28]  bit of due diligence to make sure that i am optimizing my time um and you know so i i don't i have done
[6424.28 --> 6430.92]  i have done interview requests with very very small publications in the past and i have turned down
[6430.92 --> 6436.04]  very big ones it's not a hard and fast rule it's not just like oh well like are you big enough or but
[6436.04 --> 6441.56]  it's it's not like that but i also like to do my due diligence because there have been times when i've
[6441.56 --> 6447.08]  collaborated with people and not done due diligence in the past that haven't worked out so great um
[6447.64 --> 6453.32]  so i so basically there have been multiple times that i've kind of sat down and i've looked at a podcast and gone okay
[6453.96 --> 6462.28]  is anybody actually listening to this it is flipping impossible to tell how big one podcast is
[6462.28 --> 6468.68]  compared to another one unless it's like you know the top ranked you know handful per category or per
[6468.68 --> 6474.92]  country or whatever like there are some metrics but even then it is tough to know which ones are relevant
[6474.92 --> 6485.32]  people are talking about like fallon and stuff okay no no no not not not not related to that
[6485.96 --> 6493.96]  uh yeah not a big enough podcast i think no gonna need to gonna need to question that one so so i gotta
[6493.96 --> 6501.64]  tell you as an advertiser you're probably coming up against the same information wall where you just
[6502.28 --> 6510.44]  cannot tell if anybody is actually consuming this media or not and what i suspect is that the vast
[6510.44 --> 6520.68]  majority of podcasts are just part of a roster of podcasts or like a a a bundle of podcasts that are
[6520.68 --> 6528.44]  being sold by agencies some of which are performing but most of which absolutely nobody is listening to
[6528.44 --> 6536.68]  and do not want anybody to know that nobody is listening to it it's also extremely easy to
[6537.64 --> 6540.36]  these days and it has been for
[6540.36 --> 6550.04]  a while now probably four years five years maybe uh it's been extremely easy to make a very
[6550.04 --> 6556.60]  professional looking and honestly decently professional sounding podcast yeah um with some of
[6556.60 --> 6563.64]  the solutions that are out there you put that yes you some people were listen to luke today that's not
[6563.64 --> 6574.12]  my fault i didn't blame you you took it personally were copying the joe rogan setup for a while
[6574.12 --> 6578.12]  and these days it seems to be more of the andrew huberman one where it's that like
[6578.92 --> 6585.48]  spaced out wooden slat wall with the the the black behind it um they're all like sitting on a couch
[6585.48 --> 6593.56]  a very plain table and then you have two like sm7b's and if you can buy that and a like a two
[6593.56 --> 6600.44]  mic audio interface which you can do because of the road casters like everything's kind of like
[6600.44 --> 6605.96]  solved for people now um elgato can get you your your lights and things really quickly and easily
[6606.84 --> 6611.48]  when we were first doing this it was weird complicated steal things from the audio industry
[6611.48 --> 6618.76]  try to make it work science and now it's uh or you know actual training which we didn't have
[6619.64 --> 6624.84]  yeah yeah and if you have a tiny bedroom or a tiny room it's much easier to treat you know yeah and if
[6624.84 --> 6632.68]  you don't do video oh oh easy yeah but even even what my point is even doing the video side which is
[6632.68 --> 6639.32]  i think uh actually i think there's something there i a lot of these smaller podcasts have been doing
[6639.32 --> 6645.56]  video these days and i think it's on purpose and i think it's because you can achieve that professional look
[6645.56 --> 6652.68]  quite easily um and then if you can get in one of these bundles or if you can at least if you can
[6652.68 --> 6658.36]  make yourself look professional or whatever if you can pay to have a very reputable guest come on um
[6658.36 --> 6662.20]  even if you're not getting a ton of views if you can get some clips from it if you can get whatever
[6662.20 --> 6668.60]  else you can make yourself look very popular um there was there was some proof not that long ago that
[6668.60 --> 6677.08]  people were making fake podcasts uh and using that to promote products i don't know if you've heard
[6677.08 --> 6682.68]  about this but they would make these podcast looking sets with these the wooden slats in the background
[6682.68 --> 6688.84]  with the black behind the wooden slats maybe a fake little ikea plant the sm7b's wooden table people
[6688.84 --> 6694.68]  facing each other it wouldn't even be a real podcast it would just be two people talking about like yeah
[6694.68 --> 6698.52]  this thing like changed my life whatever blah blah blah blah blah and it would look like a discussion
[6698.52 --> 6705.64]  but it was a like a shadow advertisement it's it's fake influencers pretending that they're having a
[6705.64 --> 6710.84]  podcast and they're just naturally talking about something but they're not they're advertising very
[6710.84 --> 6716.44]  specifically for a product that was a huge thing for a while that became a thing because achieving this
[6716.44 --> 6723.08]  professional looking podcast look became relatively i know i'm saying cheap when it's a few thousand
[6723.08 --> 6729.72]  dollars but relatively cheap and easy for how much money you can gain back from it yes exactly yeah
[6729.72 --> 6733.88]  that's why you see that a lot on tick tock yeah i don't know i don't use tick tock but that i know
[6733.88 --> 6738.52]  that was a thing for quite a while i'm not surprised it's still a thing um and when you know that the
[6738.52 --> 6744.36]  barrier of entry is that low if you can use that low barrier of entry to get into the podcasting space
[6744.36 --> 6752.76]  and then hide under a non-reported play count like i promise you people are gaming that system i i would bet
[6753.08 --> 6759.48]  very solid cash that people would be gaming that system anyway i fully as someone who has had to
[6760.68 --> 6768.52]  claw my way for every for every bit of recognition do you have any idea how hard it was
[6769.48 --> 6775.80]  to sell sponsorships against youtube videos 13 years ago well especially when you were effectively the
[6775.80 --> 6781.96]  first one doing it do you have any idea how hard that was and like the craziest part to me back in
[6781.96 --> 6791.24]  the day was like i had metrics and i'm up against these guys that have no metrics as far as i can tell
[6791.88 --> 6798.12]  nobody is actually watching any of it and i see the kinds of deals and budgets that they're getting and
[6798.12 --> 6805.72]  i'm just like this is insane just completely stop writing their checks sign them over to me and
[6805.72 --> 6811.40]  immediately watch your roi go up but it but it took a decade it took a decade for people to figure it
[6811.40 --> 6817.24]  out and a lot of them still haven't so as someone who had to actually have all of my performance
[6817.24 --> 6822.76]  completely transparent to every brand and every viewer that i've ever engaged with every collaborator
[6822.76 --> 6831.80]  that i've ever worked with i support it put play counts on it yeah yeah i've got our podcast metrics
[6831.80 --> 6837.00]  here if you want any insight or you want me to share any insight but are they real who knows
[6838.68 --> 6844.52]  do they report we don't get a ton on the on the listening side which is we do we get 75
[6845.00 --> 6851.40]  over the video side of our spotify i actually have no idea what our podcast numbers are sorry
[6851.40 --> 6855.96]  are dan are you talking about them right now yeah do you have a guess how many how many uh that's a
[6855.96 --> 6861.32]  lot higher than i thought how many streams have you have we done this year like when show streams yeah
[6861.32 --> 6869.88]  year i mean like like 20 or whatever oh sorry uh how many streams streams views downloads there's
[6869.88 --> 6875.40]  there's kind of a complicated way to categorize we've had about 20 episodes right and then every episode
[6875.40 --> 6881.88]  does anywhere from half a million to three quarters of a million on youtube generally we had kind of a
[6881.88 --> 6885.72]  rough week last week and i think this week's going to be pretty rough i think we did not nail the title
[6885.72 --> 6892.60]  of this one but whatever we do our best um so that would be you know 10 million or whatever on youtube
[6892.60 --> 6899.24]  so let's say i literally have no idea uh let's say
[6902.04 --> 6906.04]  spotify i don't know i don't even subscribe to spotify i don't even like you remember podcast goes
[6906.04 --> 6913.08]  out to everywhere where there is podcast podcast is like a really cool format um two million two
[6913.08 --> 6920.04]  million almost exactly two million streams oh okay yeah it was very bang on okay well then that's fine i guess
[6920.04 --> 6926.20]  and like a quarter of that are watching because we do video for for spotify okay i didn't even know
[6926.20 --> 6930.84]  my life makes my life so much easier not a lot of people do it was a new feature that they were
[6930.84 --> 6938.28]  testing for a while so 75 percent listen about 25 seem to watch huh um that might be a spotify only
[6938.28 --> 6944.76]  thing and podcasts go to literally anywhere like it goes on itunes or or anywhere um because it's rss
[6944.76 --> 6949.96]  feed based and that's a funny thing because then super cool that makes us a really big youtube
[6949.96 --> 6955.80]  tech live stream we're but actually one of the largest podcast oh see that's the thing these
[6955.80 --> 6961.56]  numbers are so small to me i just assumed that we're a small podcast it's very interesting no we're
[6961.56 --> 6966.84]  one of the large ones i think the because of the barrier for entry is so low now and like most people
[6966.84 --> 6971.80]  aren't doing what we do which is the bad way to do it which is just record it live and then send it
[6971.80 --> 6978.60]  without doing any mastering pass at all yeah whatever so we try our best um do we though yeah no yeah
[6978.60 --> 6983.56]  if you how much more money do you want to spend on this we could make it no we don't want to we
[6983.56 --> 6988.44]  don't want to try our best no you don't not trying our best and we don't want you do not want to it
[6988.44 --> 6996.36]  will cost you an arm and a leg um but like 25 of people finish a quarter of an episode five percent
[6996.36 --> 7001.56]  finish three quarters of an episode and three percent almost finish all of it that's terrible
[7002.44 --> 7005.96]  so that's just like a complete waste of time and we shouldn't even bother uploading them then
[7005.96 --> 7012.68]  no it's pretty it's pretty useful is it okay for for reasons how do i how i won't go into so here
[7013.08 --> 7017.56]  i'm so here i'm it's good i'm gonna try and do this good i'm gonna try and do this okay so i'm
[7017.56 --> 7023.56]  i am trying to find top tech podcast so i because dan pulled this pulled this statement as far as i can
[7023.56 --> 7030.44]  tell completely out of his butt that we are one of the bigger tech podcasts and i'm i'm looking at this
[7030.44 --> 7037.48]  and i'm going how how are you supposed to know that is can you hear me yes okay my computer's doing
[7037.48 --> 7045.56]  that thing so i'll be back okay i will meet you top shows okay so these are are these the top technology
[7045.56 --> 7057.96]  podcasts uh like verge i know the verge i know ted is that a tech podcast though a lot of ted stuff
[7057.96 --> 7065.56]  is kind of tech wait these are just top episodes why is this why is this so obtuse i tried to okay
[7065.56 --> 7069.96]  top shows okay here we go uh
[7073.80 --> 7081.40]  yeah dude we're tiny unless we're not depends on the category it can be a little bit complicated i
[7081.40 --> 7088.20]  mean we do get rankings for us um and this is specifically on apple pie because we haven't even
[7088.20 --> 7095.48]  dude we haven't even shown up yet dude when show when shows not even top 100 according to this
[7096.12 --> 7100.28]  maybe not of all time but certainly in the tech sector i know that we're up there but this is tech
[7100.28 --> 7108.52]  oh wait charts genre yeah genre 13 18 i mean we got linux unplugged see now though now we're getting to
[7108.52 --> 7116.12]  the point where i'm having a hard time believing and i don't want to call anybody in particular out okay
[7117.08 --> 7124.60]  so wan show no okay yeah i'm having a hard time believing okay i look i don't want to call i don't
[7124.60 --> 7130.04]  want to call anybody out but who is logan bartlett i just want to know who logan bartlett is that 4.8
[7130.04 --> 7135.96]  stars that's really good apparently this is really good there's the internet is full of influencers
[7135.96 --> 7145.16]  i've never heard of so it's nothing personal logan bartlett okay so the buddy uploads on youtube
[7146.12 --> 7159.08]  and has some very very popular videos uh first interview with sam altman after gpt 4.0 okay so
[7159.08 --> 7160.36]  that's that's pretty cool
[7163.32 --> 7169.24]  i'm not sure if i believe that this podcast is bigger than ours though based on the numbers i'm
[7169.24 --> 7174.52]  looking at but that's the thing is some of the splits are obscene yeah i i look at everything
[7174.52 --> 7182.28]  through a youtube lens like i'm youtube native and everything else is just like well okay not everything
[7182.28 --> 7186.76]  else but
[7187.64 --> 7193.88]  same way that someone will be like big on instagram and i'll be like are they actually big and then
[7193.88 --> 7197.72]  check their like youtube because again i'm youtube first and then i have to take a step back and be
[7197.72 --> 7204.28]  like oh wait no this is this is an instagram first creator if this person is a podcast first or
[7204.28 --> 7208.76]  yeah or you know spotify first creator then
[7210.84 --> 7215.72]  yeah i mean think think about something like twitch you know if you have six concurrent viewers
[7215.72 --> 7220.12]  you're in top percentages if the barrier for entry for podcasts is so low and you can just like
[7220.76 --> 7225.80]  sit down and upload whatever you want you know if you're oh if you if you're in the top 10 000 you're
[7225.80 --> 7232.76]  doing pretty okay eddie coldrick oh so we're not under tech we're under tech news i'm working on it
[7232.76 --> 7238.20]  yeah i can't i can't find our our rankings that we're in the top 10.
[7243.16 --> 7246.92]  and there's also tech news the funny us tech news uk that sort of thing
[7247.96 --> 7252.12]  i haven't heard of some of the other things that are in the top 10.
[7252.12 --> 7255.48]  yeah i think we talked about this ages ago if you remember when we were starting into this
[7256.52 --> 7262.20]  who are these people and they're more popular by us by like a large margin i pretty much guarantee
[7262.20 --> 7268.44]  you that a lot of them say the same thing about us i'm sure i'm 100 sure who the heck are these guys
[7268.44 --> 7273.88]  i mean their show isn't even professional look at this yeah this is this is terrible garbage this
[7273.88 --> 7277.00]  actual trash actual dumpster fire
[7279.00 --> 7284.60]  i said that dude clearly just woke it woke up he didn't even do his hair what's happening that is the
[7284.60 --> 7288.76]  least of our problems you're wearing you're wearing a gaming headset made it it's like
[7290.36 --> 7298.92]  it's not even a good gaming headset oh i have rgb on it oh man uh okay no mastering pass on the audio
[7298.92 --> 7305.72]  a lot of podcasts like you know if if there is no real time master it's awful um if you if you're only
[7305.72 --> 7311.08]  listening to the audio it's nice to have it actually like sound good we are number six after
[7311.08 --> 7318.76]  cyber security headlines babbage cyberwire daily 404 media them i know and the tech news briefing from
[7318.76 --> 7325.96]  the wall street journal and they are way bigger how do you remember though i remember looking at some
[7325.96 --> 7330.76]  charts that we like i haven't touched podcasting in a while but where do these charts come from
[7330.76 --> 7335.72]  like do you have to pay someone for the charts well we get charts because we're special because
[7335.72 --> 7344.52]  we're one of the larger podcasters um wait whoa whoa whoa whoa as a larger podcaster you get intel
[7344.52 --> 7350.68]  on the other podcasters but that's not available publicly i get like well i don't know i remember
[7351.32 --> 7357.64]  i remember getting a weekly like digest email that said that we're we're better and it like that's
[7357.64 --> 7361.56]  your billboard 100. everyone should have access to that
[7364.20 --> 7372.92]  i mean charitable there we are um let's see and is this like real data like are you getting this from
[7372.92 --> 7378.44]  yeah like where's this from yeah i think everyone's just guessing dude it could it could be lies
[7379.16 --> 7383.64]  let me see if i can actually open like here we can see how many people we can see how many people like
[7383.64 --> 7389.80]  rated it that's something like how many people rated the wan show let's have a look at our dashboard
[7389.80 --> 7395.64]  wow i don't know i don't know if i agree i don't think it's that good but thank you it's very generous
[7395.64 --> 7400.36]  let's go is this just buy ratings no because this one only has 123 ratings
[7403.56 --> 7409.88]  what one uh the cyber security because i'm not super surprised because that has like the most generic name
[7409.88 --> 7414.84]  and profile photo yeah but apparently they're they're bigger but they also upload daily
[7415.80 --> 7421.40]  oh so that's a daily podcast so that's that's a volume game and a half right there
[7422.12 --> 7427.08]  i could see following that though yeah for sure security daily like how many how many
[7427.08 --> 7434.92]  audios you can listen to it on the way to work like i could absolutely see 1400 episodes
[7434.92 --> 7441.40]  so this is one i got from last year because i think they're blocked in our email thing now okay
[7441.40 --> 7452.44]  but for apple podcasts were number eight for tech news in the u.s number 211 for great britain for news
[7453.16 --> 7459.96]  number seven for great britain for tech news 146 in canada for news number two in canada for tech
[7459.96 --> 7466.44]  news that's on apple podcast sure i i don't know i think it's all made up and i support more transparency
[7467.16 --> 7477.48]  all right uh there are some oh there are some new android scam protections and this video is not out
[7477.48 --> 7484.44]  yet but we did a collaboration with kit boga recently that was a lot of fun and was both eye-opening
[7484.44 --> 7491.08]  and also extremely terrifying i it's not something i dedicate a lot of my brain cycles to it's not
[7491.08 --> 7498.52]  something that i have really experienced with my aging relatives but there are so many different angles
[7498.52 --> 7507.88]  of attack from scammers that i just never heard of and he really kind of like i don't know um
[7507.88 --> 7516.68]  um he kind of red-pilled me okay so i i get it now i am i i am i am now aware of what's out there
[7516.68 --> 7522.04]  and the world the world is is trash and it's full of people who are trash and are going to try and
[7522.04 --> 7527.32]  take everything from you for no reason other than that you have it and they don't and that sucks and
[7527.32 --> 7535.00]  thank you very much kit i appreciate you very much anyway at android io this week google announced
[7535.00 --> 7542.36]  new tools in android 16 aimed at protecting users from such scams they have new in call protections
[7542.36 --> 7548.12]  that prevent users from taking risky actions such as granting accessibility permissions or sideloading
[7548.12 --> 7556.28]  an app for the first time if you are new oh yeah if you are in call that is super cool that's a way for
[7556.28 --> 7563.88]  android to stay open and allow sideloading and allow special accessibility permissions but not allow
[7563.88 --> 7570.28]  somebody to get you to do that while you are on a phone call with them so that seems pretty neat
[7570.92 --> 7575.80]  if you are screen sharing during a phone call android will now automatically prompt you to stop
[7575.80 --> 7580.52]  sharing at the end of the call and they're piloting a program in the uk where launching a participating
[7580.52 --> 7585.08]  banking app while screen sharing with an unknown contact will trigger a warning from android and give
[7585.08 --> 7591.16]  you the option to end the call and stop screen sharing with one tap scam detection is an ai-powered
[7591.16 --> 7595.24]  tool for scam detection and text that will warn when it spots suspicious conversation patterns
[7595.24 --> 7600.52]  and key verifier allows you and the person you're messaging to verify the identity of the other party
[7600.52 --> 7607.80]  through public encryption keys to help thwart imposters eg sim swaps my only concern here is that
[7607.80 --> 7620.04]  um the kinds of users who from working with kit on that video seem to be targeted by these folks may not be
[7620.04 --> 7627.96]  helped that much by this it seems like they are accustomed to a very unsophisticated non-savvy
[7627.96 --> 7636.20]  user like i was amazed at how dense we had to pretend to be in order to get them to hang up on us um
[7637.88 --> 7647.64]  like luke i asked this one guy to sing me happy birthday um ploof and adam both succeeded in getting
[7647.64 --> 7653.88]  the scammer to sing them happy birthday uh i asked mine who's your daddy and what does he do
[7653.88 --> 7664.76]  that wasn't enough to deter him um like so the angle for the video for so you guys know what to
[7664.76 --> 7669.72]  expect it's gonna be dude it's gonna be a blast i think we shot two videos uh one for our channel
[7669.72 --> 7673.72]  one for kits i think or both for our channel i don't know we did something i think we did one for
[7673.72 --> 7678.20]  i think the other one was for kit's channel anyway the point was i just went where they told me to go and i
[7678.20 --> 7684.44]  i was a me on camera anyway um so for ours we try to make the unscammable pc and then yeah the one
[7684.44 --> 7689.96]  that i think is going live on his channel is just him having us compete to see who can keep scammers
[7689.96 --> 7695.08]  on for the longest so it's me ploof adam and elijah and kit if i recall correctly all five of us took a
[7695.08 --> 7702.52]  whack at it i might have some of these details wrong but uh the point is the um the shtick for it was that
[7702.52 --> 7708.04]  we don't just keep them on the phone because honestly that's relatively easy you have someone off camera
[7708.04 --> 7713.48]  holding up a piece of paper with stuff you have to say stuff that you have to insert in the
[7713.48 --> 7721.24]  conversation so that's where some of these like wackadoodle things who's your daddy um you have to
[7721.24 --> 7727.24]  tell them you're so lonely um no one came to my birthday party will you be my friend you have to
[7727.24 --> 7737.80]  ask if their mom's single like just oh so painful so painful anyway it's gonna be great it's gonna be
[7737.80 --> 7744.44]  great oh that's exciting don't miss it so a cool new android scan protections seems like progress but
[7745.16 --> 7749.96]  it's also hard to look at this and say anything but like feels like too little too late but let's
[7749.96 --> 7755.80]  see how it goes uh rog rig reboot is back we are excited to announce that we have once again partnered
[7755.80 --> 7760.68]  with asus to give our viewers the opportunity to be flown to linus media group headquarters where they will
[7760.68 --> 7767.56]  build a pc with me on video we are opening up to our international audience this time so all you got to

[7808.12 --> 7814.76]  also we have a float plane update this week our handsome tall intelligent rich and narcissistic chief
[7814.76 --> 7821.08]  vision officer linus sebastian had his latest vision we're trying out something new on floatplane
[7821.08 --> 7826.76]  clips these are quick behind the scenes moments that aren't quite long enough to be a full floatplane
[7826.76 --> 7838.04]  exclusive open this link to just show what it is explain if needed okay ah yes linus and elijah discuss my
[7838.04 --> 7844.44]  little pony oh i have already watched this so it started at the end we talk about our favorite ponies
[7844.44 --> 7846.44]  and people apparently liked that
[7851.32 --> 7854.28]  anyway you guys loved the first one so we're going to keep it going during computex
[7854.28 --> 7856.84]  just yell yikes from the from the background
[7859.00 --> 7862.52]  some of our team will be on the ground next week uploading random clips as they happen
[7864.12 --> 7868.68]  you may see things like eating stinky tofu for the first time silly stuff on the show floor and
[7868.68 --> 7872.44]  everything in between and yes luke will apparently be doing his traditional show floor walk
[7872.44 --> 7878.28]  uh sammy says totally announcing this so luke makes time for me to do a show floor walk with him
[7878.28 --> 7884.44]  oh okay so sammy had not discussed this with you no he asked me like a while ago if i would do it and
[7884.44 --> 7894.92]  i was like yeah and then he asked me again today and i was like yeah so i think he forgot that i
[7894.92 --> 7903.08]  i already agreed to it nice uh okay so check out the lmg team during computex at lmg.gg
[7903.08 --> 7911.96]  slash flowplane all right what else we got today okay okay i'm confused by this luke help me out here
[7913.00 --> 7920.04]  source here's ars technica industry groups decry the imminent demise of energy star uh the current
[7920.04 --> 7925.00]  u.s administration has decided to terminate the energy star program though it's not clear if
[7925.00 --> 7930.68]  energy star can be limited eliminated without an act of congress energy star is a program run by the
[7930.68 --> 7935.56]  u.s environmental protection agency the epa and the department of energy the doe to help consumers
[7935.56 --> 7939.40]  businesses and industry save money and protect the environment by using energy efficient products and
[7939.40 --> 7944.28]  practices it identifies top performing cost-effective products homes and buildings through its distinctive blue
[7944.28 --> 7952.44]  label okay what i asked for in this topic was an eli 5 for energy star because other than seeing the
[7952.44 --> 7961.24]  label on things and being like okay so that's a that i guess it's energy i never really knew what exactly
[7961.96 --> 7970.52]  it meant it meant that this one is like more ranked or good or for the efficiency but also a lot of the
[7970.52 --> 7974.60]  time it seemed kind of arbitrary because it's like yeah this one's really bad for power efficiency but
[7974.60 --> 7981.56]  also it's like on the much bigger end of like how big tvs can be in this category so obviously you know
[7981.56 --> 7987.64]  like i okay so that's what it is it is a voluntary program that was created as part of a bill passed by
[7988.28 --> 7994.76]  the uh near the end of george hw bush's time in office president clinton issued an executive order
[7994.76 --> 7998.52]  mandating that federal agencies should prioritize energy star certified products in their procurement
[7998.52 --> 8004.36]  chamber of commerce something something um energy star enabled consumers to save an estimated 500
[8004.36 --> 8009.08]  billion dollars over the past 33 years ars technica notes that companies that have invested
[8009.08 --> 8013.40]  in making more efficient products are faced with the loss of the energy star brand as a marketing tool
[8013.40 --> 8018.60]  oh this is why they care okay the energy star logo has helped them make the case with the
[8018.60 --> 8022.68]  government support that the initial cost of efficient appliances will be offset over time
[8022.68 --> 8032.20]  in reduced water and energy consumption got it i was trying to figure out why industry groups cared
[8032.20 --> 8039.80]  about energy star going away so the answer is marketing hit me hit me you guys in the chat do you
[8040.52 --> 8047.56]  do you factor energy star into your purchases because i gotta confess other than like seeing it in my bios or
[8047.56 --> 8054.84]  whatever i i i i i can't say that it's been a major factor for me it's it's something that i see on the
[8054.84 --> 8061.48]  product after i buy it essentially every single time and almost all of chad is saying no but remember we
[8061.48 --> 8067.08]  actually haven't seen anyone in chat say we live in bc where our electricity is cheap right yeah so that's
[8067.08 --> 8073.72]  something yeah states have some of their own regulations as well i mean yeah my wife does okay
[8073.72 --> 8079.88]  and especially if it impacts like government procurement then i could see it affecting a
[8079.88 --> 8086.20]  significant number of units that are purchased even if it's not individual consumers i have for larger appliances
[8087.24 --> 8093.24]  i prefer it all else being equal i have okay i like to see it there oh interesting
[8094.68 --> 8101.88]  yeet dab man says that sticker is a real pos to remove i'd say no for appliances heck yes
[8101.88 --> 8110.60]  interesting i love that there are consumer rebates based on energy star in some jurisdictions okay
[8110.60 --> 8114.76]  so maybe this is just more of like americans have a higher level of awareness of this
[8115.32 --> 8120.60]  because up here i don't see it really that consistently applied to things i don't see it marketed that hard
[8123.40 --> 8129.64]  yeah i i don't see it marketed literally at all up here i think on appliances yeah but i don't remember
[8129.64 --> 8133.32]  a time you would have bought appliances because you bought your place new and it was full of appliances
[8134.20 --> 8141.32]  i bought a dishwasher because it didn't work did you look at the energy star not even a little bit
[8141.32 --> 8146.52]  okay i talked to my dad and i talked to some of my dad's appliance friends about which one would break
[8146.52 --> 8153.32]  the least fair enough uh no problems ever since okay well good chat
[8153.32 --> 8161.96]  uh apple is attempting to scare users if apps use external purchases uh sources the verge here
[8161.96 --> 8166.28]  allegedly allegedly apple seems to be trying scare tactics to prevent people from downloading using
[8166.28 --> 8171.64]  apps that use external payments the message which appears with a big red exclamation mark at the very
[8171.64 --> 8176.20]  top of the apps page says the following this app does not support the app store's private and secure
[8176.20 --> 8182.92]  payment system it uses external purchases scary this seems to be in response to the eu's decision in
[8182.92 --> 8187.24]  march of 2024 where they require apple to allow developers to enable external purchase options
[8187.80 --> 8193.88]  um instead of essentially forcing developers to pay a 30 fee to apple people have been reporting that
[8193.88 --> 8197.88]  this isn't new and apple has been doing it since the eu started enforcing apple to comply with the
[8197.88 --> 8202.60]  ruling change but what they've been changing is that the warning image used to just be a lowercase i
[8202.60 --> 8208.44]  for information rather than the new red exclamation mark uh okay because i was gonna say we've talked
[8208.44 --> 8213.08]  about this before 100 but that makes there was also this didn't make it into the doc this week but
[8213.08 --> 8218.44]  there was also uh like fortnite is not on the app store because kim sweeney is pushing the envelope
[8218.44 --> 8224.28]  again but also apple i in my humble opinion is clearly in the wrong here in the first place
[8224.28 --> 8229.08]  um so yeah good good luck epic and apple i hope you guys bury the hatchet someday
[8230.76 --> 8236.20]  not yet though steam didn't get hacked speaking of hacking hatchets or something valve has responded to
[8236.20 --> 8239.80]  rumors of a data breach that appears to have started on linkedin and included claims that
[8239.80 --> 8244.28]  more than 89 million records were for sale with a sample of the data made available to prospective
[8244.28 --> 8249.40]  purchasers uh something something something valve examined a leak sample and determined the data did
[8249.40 --> 8257.00]  not come from a breach of steam's systems um there's a bunch of other stuff but basically from a steam
[8257.00 --> 8261.56]  perspective valve says customers do not need to change their passwords or phone numbers as a result of
[8261.56 --> 8266.44]  this event it is not a bad idea to do it anyways though it's a good reminder to treat any account
[8266.44 --> 8271.56]  security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious though and reminds users
[8271.56 --> 8276.68]  to set up steam mobile authenticator if they haven't already all right nice pretty much good guy valve
[8277.88 --> 8285.40]  and nextcloud accuses google of deliberately crippling its app european software vendor nextcloud has accused
[8285.40 --> 8292.28]  google of deliberately crippling its android files app a file synchronization tool in 2024 google's play
[8292.28 --> 8299.32]  store revoked the all files access permission that they've had since 2016 effectively crippling the app
[8299.32 --> 8306.04]  and instructing nextcloud to use a more privacy aware replacement but nextcloud says hey we can't use
[8306.04 --> 8312.92]  those storage access framework saf cannot be used as it is for sharing exposing our files to other apps
[8312.92 --> 8318.12]  media store api cannot be used as it does not allow access to other files but only media files
[8318.76 --> 8323.80]  google's developer documentation states if you target android 11 and declare all files access
[8323.80 --> 8327.48]  it can affect your ability to publish and update your app on google play
[8330.76 --> 8334.76]  so basically you can't compete with google drive is that what i'm hearing yikes
[8334.76 --> 8344.92]  yeah timmo says there are so many file managers out there that don't have their permissions crippled uh
[8344.92 --> 8349.64]  yeah it does make it feel a little personal doesn't it i can't say for sure that it is
[8350.36 --> 8351.88]  but nextcloud sure seems to think so
[8351.88 --> 8361.16]  yeah google and apple are both uh getting really stabby about defending their mobile moats right now
[8361.72 --> 8366.60]  yeah and i hope this continues to go poorly for them me too
[8368.60 --> 8373.00]  a unique username says nextcloud is the largest competitor to all the cloud lock-in solutions from
[8373.00 --> 8379.88]  google and apple well yeah i don't i this doesn't feel accidental to me is what i'll say
[8379.88 --> 8385.24]  uh all right dan are we supposed to be doing after dark now i think we got our announcements done
[8385.24 --> 8391.40]  i think we've done all the topics let's do it wow not a ton of curated merch messages today no lots
[8391.40 --> 8397.72]  of people buying um what are they called the tall sizes well yeah that makes sense i wonder why
[8400.20 --> 8405.80]  because they're great go us it's because they're compensating it's true it's true
[8405.80 --> 8417.24]  what what for what not being short yeah we don't get to be fabric all the all the canines are short
[8417.24 --> 8422.84]  nobody just get to be surfs it's harder for us to pack because our clothing takes up more space jamie
[8422.84 --> 8430.76]  calls me slender man and asks if he needs help finding my pages 10 out of 10 banter
[8432.76 --> 8440.04]  um all right again sure uh lld could you expand on the hesitancy to include more tall skews i can't
[8440.04 --> 8445.32]  speak for others but it's worth a five to ten dollar premium for me shouldn't that cover the overhead
[8445.32 --> 8456.12]  gift cards for pink 2xl tall shirts win uh the hesitancy is that in order to stock a thing you
[8456.12 --> 8464.44]  have to buy thousands in many cases tens of thousands of dollars worth of that thing so it is both a risk
[8464.44 --> 8469.48]  management issue because you don't want to go and buy tens of thousands of dollars worth of a thing that
[8469.48 --> 8476.12]  then just sits there um because that's bad for business and also just a cash flow management
[8476.12 --> 8484.76]  exercise thing you can't just take your entire existing portfolio and okay a have the you know
[8485.80 --> 8493.32]  worker hours to create new right like new patterns for everything right like literally you are doubling
[8493.32 --> 8498.68]  the number of uh the amount of grading that you have to do so grading is where you take a design and you
[8499.48 --> 8503.64]  adjust it for all your different sizes you're you're doubling the grading that you have to do for a
[8503.64 --> 8512.20]  given style and then not only that but you are significantly increasing the amount of cash outlay that
[8512.20 --> 8521.56]  you are spending in order to hold in order to buy and hold that inventory um it's boring spreadsheet
[8522.36 --> 8528.52]  accounting stuff i don't expect people to care but it doesn't make it not
[8528.52 --> 8534.84]  just how it is and it's uh it's a big part of the same reason that or it's a big part of the reason
[8534.84 --> 8542.44]  that we also haven't just like started up an eu distribution warehouse because it's not that
[8542.44 --> 8550.20]  simple uh the logistics are not that simple the reporting and taxation and accounting and all of
[8550.20 --> 8555.96]  those things they're they're just not that simple and at the end of the day we are still and i can't
[8555.96 --> 8564.44]  emphasize this enough we are still a pretty small company right and overall we have like a hundred plus
[8564.44 --> 8568.84]  employees i think we're at around a hundred and something right now is that right luke i think so i
[8568.84 --> 8573.40]  think that's roughly correct yeah i think that's about right but creator warehouse doesn't have a
[8573.40 --> 8579.00]  hundred employees creator warehouse is a tiny company they have a couple of dozen employees
[8579.00 --> 8584.12]  the fact that they sell around the world at all is a small miracle right like what you're going to say
[8584.12 --> 8588.36]  oh yeah well they should just they should just have distribution centers on every constantly are you
[8588.36 --> 8594.60]  serious right now like we're we're no that's not how it works it's not how any of this works we are
[8594.60 --> 8599.64]  doing our best and we are going to you know constantly try to get delivery costs down around
[8599.64 --> 8605.88]  the world um we're going to try to expand our styles with you know tall sizes i just got confirmation they
[8605.88 --> 8613.24]  promised me husky sizes for t-shirts are coming in 2026 okay we're working on it um but these things
[8613.24 --> 8617.64]  take time they take cash they take hours someone's got to do it
[8617.64 --> 8628.36]  yeah like i'm happy we're we're finally getting them and i i'm really i was very surprised uh i got
[8628.36 --> 8632.20]  it spoiled to me by the chat but i was really surprised that there was all the colors for tall
[8632.20 --> 8637.72]  sizes that's that's super cool um but i didn't really expect it i mean there's a reason why almost
[8637.72 --> 8645.64]  no store that you go into has any tall sizes like it's just doubling your skews like that is tough
[8645.64 --> 8650.52]  um and you've got to know that there's some chance that it's going to work out which is why we took
[8650.52 --> 8655.16]  it slow that's why we started with the black we started with a small order because in theory anything's
[8655.16 --> 8660.76]  a great idea yeah but there's a big difference between people being excited about something and
[8660.76 --> 8666.76]  people actually pulling out their wallet and spending money on it huge difference vast ocean of
[8666.76 --> 8673.16]  difference so you need to be evidence driven that's a big part of what like terran pushes ever since he
[8673.16 --> 8678.68]  joined it's like be data driven that doesn't mean that we can't yolo and buy a fire truck once in a
[8678.68 --> 8684.44]  while but it means that we need to overall make sure that we are making decisions that are supported
[8685.16 --> 8690.92]  by real world evidence that we can use as our guiding star at the very least
[8694.68 --> 8700.60]  hi linus luke and dan question for luke which individuals or teams do the marketing or advertising
[8700.60 --> 8705.00]  for float plane it would be cool to hear about the work they do to attract new creators versus users
[8705.88 --> 8711.72]  no we do very little work to attract new creators isn't that linus yeah yeah that's my job
[8712.60 --> 8719.16]  uh i have not i have been asleep at the wheel for many years what a what a bad employee terrible this
[8719.16 --> 8729.00]  guy terrible um yeah the the business team um there's there's sean and then indirectly colton
[8729.00 --> 8735.72]  on the business team who work on coming up with like the business sides of ideas of you know trying
[8735.72 --> 8743.32]  to make float plane uh better and more worth it for people to join and stay um for a variety of creators
[8743.32 --> 8753.08]  but you know the business team is is focused on um lmg stuff but then hopefully those features uh benefit
[8753.08 --> 8758.68]  other people as well or those ideas benefit other people as well but their their goal they're looking at the
[8758.68 --> 8764.04]  ltt subscription right like they are employees at linus media group those are business people at
[8764.04 --> 8769.88]  linus me at least they're not floating and sammy is sort of indirectly a big part of the marketing
[8769.88 --> 8776.76]  of float plane just by yep i just wasn't even there yet great content absolutely yeah hard big time it's
[8776.76 --> 8781.48]  it's sammy making exclusives and and pushing the envelope with the types of things that we're doing
[8781.48 --> 8787.96]  including this i guess maybe it was linus's idea but including this um the like clips thing you're
[8787.96 --> 8793.32]  talking about the like short short content i think that's a cool idea i shouldn't say it's my idea it's
[8793.32 --> 8798.12]  not like i came up with the idea of short form content but that's not what i meant it's not like
[8798.12 --> 8803.88]  having that on the platform now oh i see um yeah get better at being a narcissist what's wrong with you
[8803.88 --> 8811.72]  sorry um but yeah so like that that's that's the engines that are going for the linus media group side
[8811.72 --> 8818.44]  and you know we we learn things from the content that lmg does and how it performs on the platforms
[8818.44 --> 8825.00]  and then and then sometimes other creators ask me effectively me about that and then i'll share some
[8825.00 --> 8829.16]  of that information so they can benefit from that learning as well and then some of the work that
[8829.16 --> 8835.96]  the business team does um can can potentially benefit other creators as well but they are
[8835.96 --> 8842.44]  generally focused on linus media group expansion within the floatplane universe and then the floatplane
[8842.44 --> 8848.12]  dev team essentially tries to make floatplane better for all the creators because the floatplane dev team
[8848.12 --> 8853.88]  is focused on the platform as a whole um the full plane dev team has been very focused on
[8853.88 --> 8860.44]  on that that big project we've been doing for a while that has been semi-leaked but not fully leaked
[8860.44 --> 8868.04]  um and that has resulted in when when the business team keeps coming to us with very very reasonable
[8869.00 --> 8876.60]  fairly measured requests uh us going sorry can't do it right now a little bit too busy and then we've
[8876.60 --> 8882.36]  been doing that for quite a while now so sorry business team but um there are things that they want
[8882.36 --> 8889.40]  to do that that will be good to be clear um and we will do it eventually but yeah that's that's kind
[8889.40 --> 8897.16]  of that circle there's there's sean and colden from the business team and then sammy from the content
[8897.16 --> 8908.12]  team and then the floatplane dev team how about some more yeah i'm just looking up this next one um this
[8908.12 --> 8912.12]  has been added to drive learn more it's like no no i want to open it in drive i have my
[8913.00 --> 8920.28]  i have my uh new product in new product introductions inventory planning sheet isn't drive awful and i'm
[8920.28 --> 8927.64]  trying to oh no oh oh cool it it enhanced without being blurry this time uh cool okay hit me dan
[8928.28 --> 8933.40]  dear daniel besser please could you ask the relevant authorities if we might be able to receive an
[8933.40 --> 8939.96]  update on the production of the pencil scribe driver yours faithfully a brit in need of a pencil okay the last
[8939.96 --> 8948.68]  npi uh document i have says current launch date april 30th 2025 what does npi mean linus new product
[8948.68 --> 8960.12]  introduction so that didn't happen good job um we don't have a history of that at this company at all
[8960.12 --> 8966.44]  in all seriousness sometimes in all seriousness we are way tighter about things now but what i'm trying to
[8966.44 --> 8976.12]  say is soon soon my niece people are kind of like chanting it in flow plane chat do we have anything
[8976.12 --> 8981.16]  we can say about mod mat we'll have updates when we can it will be ready when it is ready
[8981.72 --> 8984.44]  and we'll update you when we're able to only when it is ready
[8984.44 --> 8992.12]  my niece is having trouble finding a pc under a thousand dollars to play fortnite and roblox any
[8992.12 --> 8997.40]  tips on how to navigate ultra low budget pc buying it's hard to know the line between performance and
[8997.40 --> 9008.12]  requirements do i ever have tips on that may i may i suggest a really great uh well okay youtube channel a
[9008.12 --> 9014.76]  bit of a narcissistic host you'll have to kind of get past that whiny voice uh so check this out so
[9014.76 --> 9022.44]  linus tech tips uh yeah yeah this this guy right here oh he's awful anyway uh the point is you just go
[9022.44 --> 9029.08]  on the videos okay uh this is a man they really do like clutter up with these members only videos
[9029.80 --> 9036.60]  anyway the point is you kind of scroll down and you see if there's any good ones on uh you know making
[9036.60 --> 9042.28]  a cheap computer okay you know what i give up on that so why don't we just use search because the
[9042.28 --> 9054.60]  year is 2025 minus tech tips cheap pc build here we go okay now here's a 500 gaming pc oh a 69 gaming pc
[9055.16 --> 9062.28]  from two months ago hey that looks pretty good uh we could try yeah i wouldn't build the lowest rated pc
[9062.28 --> 9068.04]  but the ultimate 500 gaming pc from four months ago that looks pretty solid pretty solid oh you
[9068.04 --> 9072.84]  could pick a good budget gaming cpu that no one ever told you about from a month ago lots of really
[9072.84 --> 9079.00]  good resources here oh what about the repairing the perfect pc no i wouldn't recommend that the perfect
[9079.00 --> 9089.80]  pc at every price though hey there's a good one yeah heck yeah i would say of these i want to go ultimate
[9089.80 --> 9095.48]  500 gaming pc and then maybe you could make a couple a couple clever upgrades you could have a look at
[9095.48 --> 9099.80]  perfect pc at every price and and then the uh 500 gaming pc is kind of somewhere in between there
[9102.84 --> 9109.56]  hey wanda dl downsizing from three gaming pcs to just one with sunshine slash moonlight
[9109.56 --> 9116.28]  what are your thoughts on the current state of self-hosted game streaming super cool if we do a tech house
[9116.28 --> 9124.04]  which is kind of in conversation um i don't think i would run fiber optic display port and fiber usb
[9124.04 --> 9131.16]  everywhere i think i would just go sunshine moonlight run cat 6a everywhere and just freaking have one
[9131.16 --> 9136.44]  gaming pc and then like i want to try that thin clients man so cool have i talked to you about my
[9136.44 --> 9143.96]  issues with sunshine moonlight um no i meant to talk about this on wanshow but i i think i just
[9143.96 --> 9150.12]  completely forgot and it's it's been a few weeks now so i'm gonna try to make sure i get all this
[9150.12 --> 9156.68]  accurate but um i was trying to set that up at home i bought a new controller uh because linus wouldn't
[9156.68 --> 9164.68]  stop harassing me well it never worked and you my stalled so many of our gaming sessions so i got a
[9164.68 --> 9175.72]  new controller um and it comes with a little charging dock thingy a charging don't come with it but it was
[9175.72 --> 9182.04]  like really cheap right so it has a cheap charging dock yes yeah and that has a dongle in it which is
[9182.04 --> 9188.44]  nice okay it's a dongle good wireless connectivity cool i don't have to have it be wired anymore uh
[9188.44 --> 9195.88]  wow neat this is this is compelling you so so wait you say this controller you say this controller can
[9195.88 --> 9202.12]  charge i can explain why that matters it can charge on a dock and it's wireless why it matters but does it
[9202.12 --> 9211.00]  wirelessly charge you know maybe they'll come uh technically yeah yeah really with no wires yep
[9211.00 --> 9219.64]  sans wires even um where are you going with this okay my my my reason for that is i don't have the
[9219.64 --> 9225.32]  bluetooth things for my computer he doesn't have the bluetooth things i had one idea where i could buy
[9225.32 --> 9234.04]  the little antennas yeah yeah the bluetooth or wi-fi antennas or i could buy the base the dock
[9234.04 --> 9240.44]  charging thing i tried to put my dock was the same price so i decided to go with that one oh what a story
[9240.44 --> 9247.96]  riveting tail tap able to use the controller wirelessly um i can play games with my tv which
[9247.96 --> 9253.32]  seems cool so i want to do that without running a super long hdmi cable so i was trying to set up um
[9253.32 --> 9260.76]  this setup to install which one is it i don't know one of them is it sunshine on the tv i can't remember
[9261.40 --> 9265.56]  to install whichever one has to go on the tv um it turned out that i needed a
[9265.56 --> 9272.76]  a app on the tv which is like developer mode or whatever and in order to install that app you have
[9272.76 --> 9286.76]  to have um an a developer account oh do you have an lg tv nice yeah nice to so i i i set up an account and
[9286.76 --> 9293.72]  it was like acting a little bit weird when i was setting the account up so i immediately signed out
[9293.72 --> 9298.12]  went to go sign back in because i was like i don't trust that if i remember correctly there's only one
[9298.12 --> 9302.60]  password field that doesn't get you to verify your password um and there was some other stuff that was
[9302.60 --> 9308.92]  that was just acting oddly and it it refused my login so i'm like okay well forgot password i'll just
[9308.92 --> 9314.76]  reset my password and fix it um go to enter my password again you can't use the same password twice
[9314.76 --> 9321.32]  nice like hmm okay i've done it before where i've typoed a password the same way twice and then not
[9321.32 --> 9328.44]  been able to figure it out but it wasn't except i was copy pasting oh okay so but anyways so i make a
[9328.44 --> 9336.20]  new one reset the password all good i'm logged in it's all cool i log out i go to log back in again
[9336.20 --> 9343.88]  doesn't work forgot password reset password can't use the same password bro what the heck because i i
[9343.88 --> 9348.84]  have to make the account on my computer or my phone yeah and then i have to log in on the tv so i have
[9348.84 --> 9354.20]  to log in again i can't this whole like you can only log in once thing will not work for me i have to
[9354.20 --> 9359.64]  log in again so i'm like okay okay so i make a new account like maybe that account's just screwed up
[9361.00 --> 9368.52]  exact same problem okay okay okay well i'm realizing i'm on the american site anyways and my tv actually
[9368.52 --> 9373.48]  cares and it has to be the canadian site so let me do that so i'll make an account on the canadian
[9373.48 --> 9379.64]  site okay oh well you can't use the same email on both for some reason but sure why not so i have a
[9379.64 --> 9385.08]  lot of emails that's fine i'll use another email i'll make another account weird but okay i get signed
[9385.08 --> 9391.96]  in no problem sign out sign back in doesn't work reset password can't use the same password it's the same
[9391.96 --> 9400.76]  problem i can't i can't log in i can't i cannot log into this account no matter what i do i don't know
[9400.76 --> 9409.08]  why it won't work i email their support and they send me a link i i detail everything i detail everything
[9409.08 --> 9415.80]  that i did all the different accounts the different uh regions yeah everything i i get a response back
[9415.80 --> 9422.36]  that is not i promise you it is not a generic auto reply it took like two days to get the response
[9422.36 --> 9426.76]  it's clearly someone typed it out they just linked me the forgot your password link
[9428.68 --> 9429.80]  nothing else
[9432.60 --> 9437.08]  and when i got that email i was just like all right whatever i'm just gonna like come back to this in a
[9437.08 --> 9441.64]  couple weeks and whatever bug they probably have will hopefully be resolved is there not a
[9441.64 --> 9449.56]  steam link app for web os i haven't tried um i don't think there was i think yeah i think i
[9449.56 --> 9454.52]  checked and i don't think there was uh funny hat says i've lost the plot what's going on now uh user
[9454.52 --> 9461.48]  error no i just i just i just i'm just fucking yeah i'm just fucking yeah uh getting password on sign
[9461.48 --> 9465.24]  up yeah it's it might be something like that too i don't know there's something weird i ran into a
[9465.24 --> 9470.20]  problem recently i want i don't want to say what organization it was but uh i think i took a picture of
[9470.20 --> 9475.40]  it or i took a screenshot or something well that's gonna make it pretty obvious one of the well i'm
[9475.40 --> 9480.36]  not going to show it but i want to go look at what the actual rules were one of the probably worst
[9481.00 --> 9490.20]  rules for passwords eyes like ever seen um yeah so it has to have an uppercase letter it has to have
[9490.20 --> 9496.20]  a lowercase letter it has to have a number it has to have a symbol it has to have at least eight
[9496.20 --> 9505.00]  characters makes sense but it cannot be more than 15 characters but why so it has to be between
[9505.00 --> 9511.08]  eight and 15 characters save all those bits in there on their their storage server for the so
[9512.04 --> 9518.60]  there's like very a very small range of character counts that the password could even be and then
[9518.60 --> 9525.48]  there's like all these i don't know just way to way to make your thing less secure my goodness
[9525.48 --> 9530.76]  that's hilarious um okay well someone get luke a password manager i have one what are you even
[9530.76 --> 9539.80]  talking about what does that have to do with what i'm doing whatever anyways oh geez dan hello dilla
[9539.80 --> 9545.16]  i've been curious about the silicon lottery and how some cpus on the same batch can be better than others
[9545.16 --> 9552.12]  what exactly is better like how do the less better ones even work so there's a ton of redundancy when
[9552.12 --> 9561.32]  you manufacture high complexity silicon products more than you would probably imagine is is wasted to
[9561.32 --> 9569.80]  having a backup plan in case there is a small imperfection um so that's part of it is you can have one that has
[9569.80 --> 9581.80]  um that is that is that is is higher quality um in certain spots so uh for instance like back when uh
[9581.80 --> 9589.64]  nvidia had those gpus in the 465 470 days where some of the 465s could be unlocked to have additional
[9589.64 --> 9597.96]  functional units that means that they uh they didn't have so many defects in some of those uh some of the
[9597.96 --> 9602.92]  i forget if they were called sms back then but whatever in some of those functional units um such
[9602.92 --> 9610.04]  that they had to be shut off so part of it is you can just have parts of the cpu that have so many
[9610.04 --> 9615.96]  problems with or gpu or whatever it is that have so many problems with them that they they can't turn
[9615.96 --> 9623.48]  on that part of it um you can also have ones that have more parts of them that can be turned on versus
[9623.48 --> 9628.76]  ones that can have fewer parts that's why you'll get like amd's tri cores back in the day those were
[9628.76 --> 9636.28]  all quad core cpus but like one of the cores was in many cases dead or in many cases actually not dead
[9636.28 --> 9642.76]  and you could unlock them to quad core processors okay so then the other part is more to do with the
[9642.76 --> 9650.92]  overall quality of it and that's where everything might work but it might not be within the target
[9650.92 --> 9657.00]  power envelope or thermal envelope for that particular part uh so they might have to you
[9657.00 --> 9663.48]  know turn off some cores or turn off some cash for that reason uh probably wouldn't affect cash so much
[9663.48 --> 9667.96]  but but cores for sure you might have to turn off some cores in order to make this one fit into the
[9667.96 --> 9676.04]  power envelope for you know uh a core i5 you know 14th gen or whatever the case may be so basically what
[9676.04 --> 9681.72]  it comes down to is that it's pretty much black magic at this point how they managed to make
[9681.72 --> 9688.12]  anything as small as it is there are a ton of defects in them both small defects in terms of
[9688.12 --> 9695.00]  like oh yeah this gap is like this many like freaking angstroms larger or smaller than it's supposed to be
[9695.00 --> 9700.12]  and you know that could affect uh the the power or performance character the switching speeds of it
[9700.12 --> 9705.48]  or you know whatever else you can have defects like that um you can have defects that are caused by
[9705.48 --> 9713.16]  contamination um so they build in a ton of redundancy and they also use binning as they're sorting all
[9713.16 --> 9720.28]  of these dies to turn them into different products at different tiers uh based on what they know during
[9720.28 --> 9726.12]  the pre-production process and the design process is going to be their defect rate so silicon lottery
[9726.12 --> 9734.04]  basically just means that you know both of these chips might you know pass the minimum bar of how many
[9734.04 --> 9739.08]  cores need to be active and what kind of power and thermal characteristics it's supposed to have
[9739.08 --> 9743.00]  but one was like slightly more better and that's great
[9745.32 --> 9749.32]  and one of them wasn't and you either get a better one or you don't and there's absolutely no way of
[9749.32 --> 9755.72]  knowing because intel or amd or nvidia they don't want to go into things with that degree of granularity
[9755.72 --> 9758.76]  because then their product stack becomes an absolute cluster bomb
[9761.88 --> 9768.52]  and last one i've got for you today hello lld just wondering will the cargo shorts come back
[9768.52 --> 9774.68]  sometime in the future i love mine just wish i had gotten more oh alan actually has a really really
[9774.68 --> 9779.80]  cool way of explaining the like the small defects like differences in gaps and stuff remember folks
[9779.80 --> 9786.44]  computers are actually analog machines that operate on digital logic so small defects can
[9786.44 --> 9791.56]  change the analog characteristics without affecting the binary logic up to a point if you crank up the
[9791.56 --> 9797.72]  analog the boolean logic breaks down so analog meaning like voltage current temperatures things that are
[9797.72 --> 9807.64]  inherently analog yeah that's a really good way of explaining that uh okay cargo shorts i don't know uh hold on let me see
[9809.80 --> 9821.32]  oh that wouldn't be a new product introduction anyway so it wouldn't be on this document so i honestly
[9821.32 --> 9832.04]  have no idea i'm sorry uh maybe i think so uh if they do they do not this year
[9832.04 --> 9843.64]  yeah not this year yeah not this year and that's it we'll see you again next week guys same bad time
[9843.64 --> 9848.44]  same bad channel i'll see you soon i guess oh yeah bye
[9848.44 --> 9856.20]  bye
[9856.92 --> 9858.34]  hmm
[9858.34 --> 9862.28]  okay
