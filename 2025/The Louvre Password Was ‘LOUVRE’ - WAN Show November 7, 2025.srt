[0.00 → 4.62] Welcome to the WAN Show! We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[5.34 → 10.10] Video games, it turns out, are more accurate than we thought. Also, bad movies.
[10.74 → 18.66] The password for the Louvre, for part of their security system, was literally Louvre.
[19.52 → 20.72] Which, um...
[20.72 → 21.04] Nice.
[21.16 → 23.88] You know what? I like it. Nice and easy to remember.
[24.38 → 28.52] No one on staff will ever forget that.
[28.52 → 32.08] You know, you wouldn't have issues logging into things if that's what our passwords are like.
[32.30 → 36.48] If your password for Teams was just Teams, you know, your life would be better.
[37.10 → 41.68] Also, I'm going to talk about my experience at the airport with a total jackass.
[42.28 → 44.56] That's what your announcement talks about.
[44.56 → 45.48] Yes, because...
[45.48 → 46.84] Because...
[46.84 → 47.66] Because...
[47.66 → 48.42] What?
[48.54 → 54.34] Travel sucks enough already, and I don't need to be getting in an argument with people before 6 in the morning
[54.34 → 59.02] over things that they are completely, objectively, 100% wrong about.
[59.74 → 60.46] Oh, boy.
[60.48 → 61.54] That's what I don't need.
[61.58 → 67.90] I have no idea what this is about, but the fact that he's that juiced up, and we're not even, like, into the show yet is...
[67.90 → 68.30] I don't know.
[68.68 → 70.68] It's both exciting and concerning at the same time.
[70.82 → 74.34] It's been a heck of a week for YouTube, and we're going to talk about that.
[74.34 → 79.26] We unfortunately can't talk about the things that I saw today, but there are other things going on at YouTube.
[79.26 → 81.26] And also...
[82.12 → 84.26] Find the good news.
[85.10 → 85.60] Find it.
[85.78 → 86.44] You can do it.
[86.80 → 87.84] You can do it.
[88.70 → 89.60] Stop Killing Games?
[90.06 → 90.42] Sure.
[90.56 → 90.74] Yeah.
[90.84 → 91.36] That's pretty good news.
[91.38 → 95.98] Stop Killing Games petition was debated in UK Parliament, and we'll talk about that.
[109.26 → 121.98] The ON Show is brought to you by Squarespace, AMD, Rove Lab, and Green.
[122.12 → 127.26] Alongside, of course, our wrap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner...
[131.26 → 132.86] Battery.
[133.56 → 134.64] Oh, my goodness.
[134.64 → 140.24] They apparently genuinely don't like this, but hey, you know, there are lots of other podcasts, so...
[141.14 → 142.44] They'll get over it.
[142.90 → 143.48] Silly goose.
[143.52 → 144.90] What do you want to jump right into?
[147.58 → 148.64] Well, what was the...
[148.64 → 150.02] The title topic was the Louvre thing.
[150.08 → 150.70] Let's just do that.
[150.80 → 151.82] Yeah, let's do that.
[152.28 → 154.84] This was prepped by Mr. Jordan Block from the writing team.
[154.84 → 163.22] If you've ever been disappointed by terrible security practices depicted in your favourite media, video games, movies, books, and you've gone,
[163.62 → 163.94] Ugh.
[164.76 → 165.60] Come on.
[165.64 → 167.10] This isn't even plausible.
[167.76 → 177.00] This totally wrecks my suspension of disbelief because there is no way that, you know, insert institution here,
[177.00 → 185.76] be it a bank, a museum, or even your local library, could be so careless as to just have the password be the name of the
[185.76 → 188.06] Oh, my God, it happened at the Louvre.
[188.92 → 196.94] The investigation into the October 18th broad daylight heist of more than $100 million worth of jewels from the Louvre...
[196.94 → 202.82] I'm putting it on the quotes because I think a lot of the valuation of it was kind of, like, sentimental, right?
[203.46 → 204.58] Is that correct?
[204.70 → 205.60] Am I missing something here?
[205.64 → 209.64] Because I thought it wasn't actually worth that much in, like, melted down gold, right?
[210.56 → 212.06] I feel like that's true.
[212.30 → 212.66] Anyway.
[213.00 → 218.30] As far as my understanding goes, they targeted things that you could sell if it was melted down,
[218.76 → 223.00] and the assumption that I heard was just in case it was, like, too hot to move,
[223.40 → 226.16] they could just melt it down and sell it for its materials.
[226.16 → 233.20] Anyway, the investigation revealed some stunning lapses in security going back at least a decade.
[233.94 → 242.74] A 2014 audit by the French cybersecurity agency found that the password for the video surveillance system
[242.74 → 248.86] was apparently Louvre, L-O-U-V-R-E in all caps,
[248.86 → 255.14] and other security systems had equally trivial passwords.
[255.14 → 261.80] A follow-up audit started in 2015 and concluded two years later reported,
[262.46 → 263.14] and this is a quote,
[263.46 → 270.48] serious shortcomings included outdated and malfunctioning security systems.
[270.84 → 278.08] Documents from 2025 indicate that the museum was still using unsupported security software purchased in,
[278.08 → 286.30] and I kid you not, 2003, running on Windows Server 2003,
[287.30 → 294.04] even extended EOL for Windows Server 2003 R2 was July 2015,
[294.76 → 300.40] 10 years ago, and mainstream support ended five years earlier than that.
[300.40 → 304.10] Now, our discussion question, and I'm going to draw Dan into it.
[304.70 → 305.52] Nice hoodie, Dan.
[305.76 → 306.22] Thank you.
[306.28 → 306.68] Nice hoodie, Dan.
[306.72 → 307.32] You look great.
[308.46 → 309.94] That's a weird thing to do with it.
[310.78 → 313.46] I'm showing off the new pockets.
[314.30 → 314.74] Good.
[315.18 → 316.30] That is wonderful.
[316.90 → 318.26] I'm a normal person.
[318.92 → 319.68] We know.
[320.78 → 321.48] Nice sweater.
[321.48 → 325.90] Okay, he's going to keep doing it.
[326.26 → 326.62] Wonderful.
[327.12 → 327.52] So...
[327.52 → 328.46] TC Muggers, everybody.
[329.94 → 330.56] Do you guys...
[330.56 → 331.36] I'm hot, okay?
[332.42 → 334.26] Do you guys want to have a little bit of story time?
[334.58 → 334.94] Sure.
[335.08 → 335.22] Yes.
[335.22 → 341.56] Talk about just some sort of egregious security things that you've experienced,
[341.70 → 343.38] like at work, say for instance,
[343.52 → 345.38] hopefully Luke doesn't have too many stories,
[345.44 → 347.92] because he hasn't worked too many places other than here.
[347.92 → 351.98] I can talk a little bit about NCI.
[352.82 → 354.84] I did something stupid at my last job as well.
[355.18 → 355.64] Oh, sure.
[355.72 → 356.36] You want to go first?
[356.88 → 357.60] Yeah, sure.
[357.96 → 361.02] When I was an inexperienced systems administrator,
[361.16 → 363.92] and I was running AD at my last job,
[364.04 → 365.98] I exposed port 80 publicly,
[365.98 → 368.18] so that we could have remote desktop working.
[369.28 → 373.06] And the main editing server, video server,
[373.06 → 381.18] and, you know, NVR server ended up getting overtaken with, like, fake ransomware.
[381.54 → 382.88] They didn't actually have ransomware.
[382.98 → 384.82] The pop-up just said that it had ransomware.
[384.98 → 385.36] Oh, my God.
[385.36 → 388.36] And then they were also using it to, like, scam old people
[388.36 → 390.72] by creating hundreds of, like, Facebook accounts.
[391.32 → 392.36] So they didn't change...
[392.36 → 393.40] Look at me, I am the botnet now.
[393.50 → 395.84] Yeah, they didn't change any of the passwords.
[396.22 → 398.58] It was just, like, full botnet server.
[398.80 → 400.66] I just logged in, and everything was fine,
[400.66 → 402.72] and I saw all this stuff, and I went, oh, okay, well...
[402.72 → 403.38] That is, yeah.
[403.90 → 404.70] That is, uh...
[404.70 → 405.52] Oh, no.
[405.74 → 406.16] Okay, my...
[406.16 → 407.42] It ended up being totally fine.
[407.84 → 409.64] So no lessons learned at all.
[410.14 → 410.54] My...
[410.54 → 412.28] Oh, uh...
[412.28 → 412.66] Neat.
[412.76 → 413.06] Okay.
[413.30 → 416.14] Um, my story was going to be about NCI,
[416.48 → 418.32] where, Luke, you might remember this,
[418.38 → 420.68] there was probably about a 50-50 shot
[420.68 → 425.28] that if you typed net link 888 into a password field,
[425.28 → 428.34] it would just grant you immediate authentication
[428.34 → 431.18] into whatever system it was you were trying to access.
[431.98 → 432.46] Oh, yeah.
[432.70 → 433.44] Yeah, for sure.
[433.70 → 435.96] I mean, but, okay, in fairness,
[436.52 → 437.18] in fairness,
[438.48 → 439.40] password managers,
[440.06 → 440.94] were they a thing yet?
[443.90 → 444.46] Uh...
[444.46 → 445.64] Not mainstream, anyway.
[445.80 → 449.46] Really kind of extremely non-mainstream
[449.46 → 452.06] and really annoying to use ones were.
[452.60 → 454.48] But, like, corporate level, like,
[454.62 → 455.98] I don't really think so.
[456.26 → 457.68] Like, it's a legitimate problem.
[457.68 → 458.96] There's a reason...
[458.96 → 459.50] Not that I remember.
[459.50 → 461.70] ...that people would put passwords on Post-it notes
[461.70 → 463.64] and that people would just, like...
[463.64 → 465.82] Or have them on a sticky note on their keyboard
[465.82 → 467.56] or whatever the case may be.
[467.82 → 468.20] Like, or...
[468.20 → 469.80] You know, we've been talking...
[469.80 → 470.50] First time.
[470.52 → 473.20] We've been talking about, um...
[473.20 → 474.96] You know, our password manager management
[474.96 → 477.08] and little things like that
[477.08 → 479.36] slightly over the last little bit.
[479.76 → 483.12] And I was visiting a company recently
[483.12 → 485.12] and asked them, like,
[485.32 → 486.78] you know, I don't know if you can answer me,
[486.90 → 490.34] but what do you guys use for password management?
[490.46 → 491.08] And this was a...
[494.08 → 496.34] Big-time, big-money company.
[496.52 → 497.36] That's what I'll say.
[497.94 → 498.26] Yeah.
[498.26 → 499.86] Their answer was, we don't.
[500.50 → 502.42] Even big-time, big-money companies
[502.42 → 504.44] have, like, normal people working at them
[504.44 → 507.22] that just, quite frankly, can't be arsed.
[507.92 → 508.20] Yep.
[508.62 → 510.24] Like, they were legitimately, like,
[510.60 → 513.98] I don't know, like, Google Keychain or whatever.
[514.42 → 515.34] I was like, oh.
[516.32 → 516.68] Yeah.
[516.82 → 517.30] All right.
[517.48 → 519.50] Now, I did continue the conversation
[519.50 → 520.10] because I was like, all right,
[520.12 → 522.40] that doesn't really sound 100% correct.
[522.52 → 524.56] Well, I'm sure the IT team uses stuff.
[525.34 → 526.14] Well, yeah.
[526.24 → 528.70] So, it's mostly SSO,
[528.98 → 531.72] which did make a lot of sense.
[531.84 → 532.26] Okay, that's fine.
[532.26 → 533.86] So, a lot of these companies can kind of force
[533.86 → 536.48] a very large amount of their accounts
[536.48 → 538.08] to be done through SSO.
[538.32 → 538.72] But...
[538.72 → 539.18] And outside of that,
[539.32 → 541.34] they do have a key...
[541.34 → 542.50] They have a...
[542.50 → 545.72] They have some, like, service-sharing thing,
[545.78 → 546.78] which sounded really cool,
[546.88 → 548.26] but for most of your accounts,
[548.34 → 549.10] it's just local.
[549.84 → 550.16] Wow.
[550.50 → 551.12] I mean...
[551.12 → 551.36] Yeah.
[551.48 → 552.04] You know what?
[552.10 → 553.42] The thing, too, though,
[553.60 → 556.00] is that most accounts...
[556.00 → 557.20] And, okay, this is...
[557.20 → 557.70] Ah, man.
[558.12 → 560.10] We are, like, minutes into the show,
[560.10 → 561.84] and I'm going to say something super controversial.
[561.84 → 564.46] Most accounts...
[564.46 → 565.10] Oh, I know where you're going.
[565.22 → 566.30] ...don't really matter.
[566.84 → 567.16] Yeah!
[567.44 → 568.32] I was right.
[570.06 → 571.40] I don't even really disagree.
[572.40 → 573.06] But, like, I don't...
[573.06 → 574.38] A lot of it's pretty unimportant.
[574.46 → 576.62] Dude, I don't want 2FA
[576.62 → 580.18] on some stupid, like, game service
[580.18 → 582.60] that I used to buy one game
[582.60 → 584.40] that I use for benchmarking.
[584.84 → 585.16] Let me...
[585.16 → 586.56] Especially if we can...
[586.56 → 588.36] We can probably recover it
[588.36 → 589.34] if anything goes down,
[589.34 → 590.72] and if it does get stolen,
[591.08 → 591.56] then it's like...
[591.56 → 592.88] If someone has it for, like,
[592.90 → 593.86] a couple of days...
[593.86 → 595.94] It's $30 worth of league skins.
[596.36 → 597.80] Like, I just don't care.
[598.32 → 598.58] You know?
[598.62 → 598.92] Well, no.
[599.00 → 600.08] Like, our benchmarking accounts
[600.08 → 600.70] would be more valuable than that these days.
[600.70 → 601.12] Oh, no, no.
[601.12 → 602.86] Our benchmarking accounts, we should.
[603.12 → 604.56] We absolutely should.
[604.82 → 606.62] But, like, personally, right?
[606.68 → 608.56] Like, I'll have services that are just...
[608.56 → 610.28] They're badgering me
[610.28 → 612.00] to implement 2FA,
[612.12 → 612.84] or in some cases,
[612.84 → 613.80] they even force me
[613.80 → 614.78] to implement 2FA,
[614.78 → 615.80] and I'm just like,
[615.92 → 618.02] bro, you ain't that important.
[618.66 → 619.78] My password for you
[619.78 → 620.48] is literally
[620.48 → 622.34] the name of the service.
[622.70 → 623.02] It's...
[623.02 → 623.74] The password is
[623.74 → 625.24] Louvre88.
[625.92 → 627.00] Like, I don't care.
[627.52 → 628.14] You know?
[628.34 → 629.04] I wonder...
[629.04 → 630.22] I wonder how many people
[630.22 → 631.08] are going to start using that
[631.08 → 631.62] as their, like,
[631.68 → 632.50] throwaway password.
[636.10 → 637.04] You're on to me.
[639.00 → 639.56] I...
[639.56 → 640.48] Yeah, I don't know.
[640.62 → 641.84] I, um...
[641.84 → 643.92] There's, like, that...
[643.92 → 644.64] Like, one of the...
[644.64 → 645.66] Yeah, I'm actually not going
[645.66 → 646.14] to get into it
[646.14 → 646.78] because I don't need to talk
[646.78 → 647.90] about our security practices,
[648.12 → 649.26] but, um...
[650.36 → 650.58] Yeah.
[650.74 → 651.78] There's a certain amount
[651.78 → 652.20] where, like,
[652.26 → 653.72] if we're really being honest
[653.72 → 654.20] with ourselves,
[654.20 → 655.60] it's not all that important.
[655.80 → 657.14] And for this company,
[657.14 → 658.66] I don't think they're just, like,
[658.92 → 659.32] stupid.
[659.84 → 661.42] Um, I suspect
[661.42 → 663.08] it's that type of thing
[663.08 → 663.74] where for things
[663.74 → 664.48] that are genuinely
[664.48 → 665.30] really important,
[665.40 → 666.22] they have SSO.
[666.76 → 668.78] And for a couple other things,
[668.88 → 669.94] they have, like,
[670.08 → 670.74] a lot...
[670.74 → 671.66] Not very common,
[671.84 → 672.94] but they have a system
[672.94 → 673.72] where they can, like,
[674.40 → 675.44] share crews around.
[675.62 → 675.78] Yeah.
[675.88 → 676.64] Uh, but it's not really
[676.64 → 677.44] a password manager.
[677.58 → 678.30] Like, if someone...
[678.30 → 678.64] And outside of that,
[678.70 → 679.62] just whatever.
[679.82 → 680.60] If someone got into
[680.60 → 681.84] our Shutterstock account,
[682.02 → 682.56] let's say,
[683.30 → 683.58] okay,
[683.76 → 684.76] the worst thing
[684.76 → 685.30] they could do,
[685.36 → 685.94] because, like,
[685.96 → 686.50] we'll have payment
[686.50 → 687.40] information in there,
[687.46 → 688.52] but it'll be obfuscated.
[688.76 → 689.86] It's obfuscated, yeah.
[689.86 → 690.96] So they could find
[690.96 → 692.06] our corporate address,
[692.64 → 693.78] which is on Google Maps.
[694.46 → 694.68] Yep.
[694.72 → 695.64] They could find the name
[695.64 → 696.70] of whoever admins
[696.70 → 697.84] Shutterstock for us,
[697.94 → 698.80] which, realistically,
[699.40 → 700.66] it's probably still
[700.66 → 701.32] under Easel,
[701.48 → 703.10] like, whatever.
[703.78 → 704.80] They could up
[704.80 → 705.84] your subscription tier.
[706.04 → 706.66] Yeah, they could
[706.66 → 708.08] spend a bit of our money.
[708.58 → 709.08] Like, they could...
[709.08 → 709.74] Which we can probably
[709.74 → 710.32] get back.
[710.40 → 710.90] Which we could
[710.90 → 711.94] probably get back.
[712.18 → 712.58] So, like,
[712.64 → 713.32] at the most,
[713.40 → 714.12] they could waste
[714.12 → 715.02] a little bit of our time.
[715.34 → 716.08] Now, I'm not saying
[716.08 → 717.30] our password for Shutterstock
[717.30 → 719.32] is Shutterstock 888
[719.32 → 720.00] or whatever.
[720.30 → 721.22] Shutterstock Louvre.
[721.52 → 722.88] Yeah, Shutterstock Louvre.
[723.86 → 725.84] But I personally
[725.84 → 728.26] wouldn't care if it was.
[729.04 → 730.06] And we had no 2FA
[730.06 → 730.64] on that account
[730.64 → 731.24] because I don't think
[731.24 → 731.56] it matters.
[731.80 → 732.40] Where you run into
[732.40 → 733.08] trouble, though,
[733.20 → 734.86] is that any policy
[734.86 → 736.34] that is to apply
[736.34 → 737.20] common sense
[737.20 → 738.96] and use 2FA
[738.96 → 739.96] where it matters
[739.96 → 741.32] and not use 2FA
[741.32 → 742.22] where it doesn't matter
[742.22 → 744.48] relies on everybody
[744.48 → 746.06] involved having
[746.06 → 747.26] common sense
[747.26 → 748.54] and you can't.
[749.88 → 751.04] If your policy was...
[751.04 → 752.20] You wouldn't need policy
[752.20 → 753.08] if everyone could
[753.08 → 754.40] follow common sense policy.
[755.40 → 756.40] I think that's
[756.40 → 758.10] maybe mean
[758.10 → 759.24] but also
[759.24 → 760.90] probably fair.
[761.72 → 762.66] We've got some other
[762.66 → 763.74] good stories in the chat.
[765.14 → 765.84] Hold on.
[765.90 → 766.48] Where is it?
[766.84 → 767.70] Yeah, funny hats
[767.70 → 768.62] in float plane chat.
[768.78 → 769.58] Is he frozen, Dan?
[770.42 → 770.94] Nope.
[771.30 → 771.74] Oh, okay.
[771.80 → 771.98] Wow.
[772.08 → 773.90] No, he's just...
[773.90 → 774.26] Okay.
[774.74 → 775.58] Funny hats
[775.58 → 776.36] in float plane chat
[776.36 → 776.54] says,
[776.60 → 777.30] I remember to going
[777.30 → 778.02] all the computers
[778.02 → 778.94] in Tiger Direct
[778.94 → 780.42] and typing in Tiger
[780.42 → 781.40] to get in.
[782.60 → 783.52] I mean, yeah,
[783.60 → 784.88] especially back then,
[784.96 → 786.02] like in the late 90s
[786.02 → 787.06] or early 2000s,
[787.06 → 788.66] that really doesn't
[788.66 → 789.76] surprise me that much
[789.76 → 790.56] because...
[791.48 → 792.92] And, okay,
[793.36 → 794.46] I might out us
[794.46 → 795.32] a little bit here,
[795.48 → 796.56] but for benchmarking
[797.16 → 798.28] computers in particular,
[798.74 → 799.92] there are a handful
[799.92 → 800.64] of credentials
[800.64 → 802.84] that people kind of
[802.84 → 804.18] expect to see on them
[804.18 → 805.30] because otherwise
[805.30 → 806.74] it would be chaos.
[807.32 → 808.06] Like if everybody,
[808.24 → 809.30] if on every computer
[809.30 → 810.24] that we unboxed
[810.24 → 811.02] on Short Circuit,
[811.50 → 812.28] Logistics freaking
[812.28 → 813.06] signed in to
[813.06 → 814.28] a Microsoft account,
[815.30 → 816.04] like that would,
[816.20 → 817.28] that would be
[817.28 → 818.58] potentially a nightmare
[818.58 → 819.88] because if for whatever
[819.88 → 820.46] reason,
[820.64 → 821.52] whatever account
[821.52 → 822.56] someone uses
[822.56 → 823.88] got deactivated
[823.88 → 825.62] or we didn't have
[825.62 → 826.42] access to it
[826.42 → 826.88] or whatever,
[826.88 → 830.90] it just sucks.
[831.28 → 832.22] It sucks to have
[832.22 → 833.74] to do a full reset
[833.74 → 834.50] on these devices.
[839.38 → 840.36] Oh, Luke,
[840.42 → 841.30] I see you're in chat
[841.30 → 841.96] talking about
[841.96 → 843.24] one of our topics today.
[843.68 → 844.46] Do we want to get
[844.46 → 845.22] to that one right away?
[845.22 → 845.60] I can just talk about it now.
[845.76 → 846.46] Yeah, why don't we get
[846.46 → 847.20] into that right away?
[847.88 → 849.90] So there was a...
[849.90 → 851.14] Let me scroll to my topics.
[851.26 → 852.14] I threw a couple notes
[852.14 → 852.52] in there.
[852.58 → 853.22] It's pretty straightforward,
[853.36 → 853.48] though.
[853.68 → 854.04] Flow plane,
[854.22 → 855.24] there was a backend update
[855.24 → 855.92] on Flow plane,
[856.12 → 857.14] trying to reduce tech debt
[857.14 → 858.10] and do some other things
[858.10 → 859.54] that included
[859.54 → 861.32] a little bit of human error.
[861.72 → 862.10] Unfortunately,
[862.24 → 863.82] we're not better than,
[863.88 → 864.12] you know,
[864.16 → 864.92] Amazon, Cloudflare,
[865.00 → 866.34] Microsoft and all the likes.
[866.80 → 867.92] Said error resulted
[867.92 → 869.18] in some users
[869.18 → 870.70] being charged multiple times,
[870.80 → 872.14] generally up to four,
[872.66 → 875.42] which is clearly not good.
[875.64 → 876.98] We've already pushed a fix,
[877.18 → 877.82] so it shouldn't be
[877.82 → 878.46] happening anymore.
[879.14 → 880.30] And all of those users
[880.30 → 881.28] have been refunded.
[881.38 → 882.02] If you don't see it
[882.02 → 882.74] in your account yet,
[882.78 → 883.88] it might take a little bit.
[884.04 → 884.82] Banking sometimes
[884.82 → 886.26] has, you know,
[886.38 → 886.84] delays.
[887.46 → 888.82] Can that be a topic
[888.82 → 889.46] today, too?
[890.50 → 890.86] Like...
[890.86 → 892.32] That it's so freaking
[892.32 → 893.62] slow to transfer funds around?
[893.86 → 894.14] Yeah.
[894.74 → 896.76] Like, around the world?
[897.18 → 897.82] Like, how...
[898.44 → 899.06] How...
[899.06 → 899.36] Okay.
[899.88 → 901.04] Because I can't reconcile
[901.04 → 901.64] this, Luke.
[902.04 → 903.06] On the one hand,
[903.40 → 904.32] you've got scammers
[904.32 → 906.16] that are able to bilk people
[906.16 → 906.82] out of, like,
[906.88 → 907.58] millions of dollars
[907.58 → 908.40] in some cases
[908.40 → 908.92] or companies
[908.92 → 909.80] or whatever,
[910.24 → 910.98] and the money
[910.98 → 911.96] seems to be just, like,
[912.42 → 913.20] irreversibly,
[913.46 → 914.58] like, immediately gone.
[914.82 → 915.46] And then,
[915.50 → 916.12] on the other hand,
[916.36 → 917.30] you've got...
[917.30 → 918.48] I'm trying to transfer
[918.48 → 919.26] some funds
[919.26 → 921.02] from one Canadian bank
[921.02 → 921.96] that we bank at
[921.96 → 923.48] to another Canadian bank
[923.48 → 924.28] and I have to wait, like,
[924.32 → 925.52] three to four days.
[925.72 → 926.66] And I'm just like,
[927.18 → 927.62] brother,
[927.74 → 928.68] no, but seriously,
[929.04 → 930.38] how many bytes
[930.38 → 931.00] of data
[931.00 → 932.16] is whatever
[932.16 → 933.40] authentication key
[933.40 → 934.02] you need
[934.02 → 935.82] plus the dollar value
[935.82 → 936.46] of the amount?
[936.68 → 936.72] Like,
[936.80 → 939.36] what year is it?
[939.50 → 939.92] Yeah.
[939.92 → 941.24] I don't know.
[941.24 → 942.28] I don't know how to deal
[942.28 → 942.58] with that.
[942.58 → 943.18] I honestly don't know.
[943.48 → 944.28] I know, like,
[944.42 → 946.34] to pay my credit card off
[946.34 → 948.74] can genuinely take
[948.74 → 950.76] many days sometimes.
[951.24 → 951.54] Like,
[951.58 → 952.22] I'm pretty sure
[952.22 → 952.78] I've had it take,
[952.90 → 952.96] like,
[953.02 → 953.90] four days before,
[954.54 → 956.34] which has sketched
[956.34 → 957.10] and resulted in me,
[957.14 → 957.32] like,
[957.48 → 958.74] prepaying certain amounts
[958.74 → 959.40] just to make sure
[959.40 → 960.24] I don't get dinged
[960.24 → 960.52] and, like,
[960.54 → 961.20] all this weird stuff.
[961.20 → 961.34] Oh, dude,
[961.40 → 962.06] I used to do that
[962.06 → 962.58] all the time
[962.58 → 963.98] back when I was responsible
[963.98 → 965.24] for paying my own credit card,
[965.30 → 965.44] Bill.
[965.76 → 966.50] Love you, Yvonne.
[967.22 → 968.72] But I would just,
[968.88 → 969.06] like,
[969.26 → 970.78] sometimes I would just
[970.78 → 972.82] transfer money
[972.82 → 973.74] into my credit card
[973.74 → 974.76] because it would,
[974.96 → 976.18] sometimes it was a few days
[976.18 → 977.04] before transactions
[977.04 → 977.76] would go through
[977.76 → 978.54] and I would just,
[978.64 → 978.70] like,
[978.74 → 979.66] I'd have extra money
[979.66 → 980.26] in my savings
[980.26 → 981.22] or my checking account
[981.22 → 981.90] and I'd be like,
[981.94 → 982.02] well,
[982.02 → 982.94] I don't really need this
[982.94 → 984.00] and realistically,
[984.00 → 985.00] I'm going to spend money
[985.00 → 986.10] on my credit card anyway
[986.10 → 987.46] because already I was,
[987.46 → 987.80] Yeah, I'd do the same thing.
[988.02 → 988.58] So I would just,
[988.64 → 989.28] I'd just be like,
[989.36 → 989.56] yeah,
[989.56 → 989.92] I don't know,
[989.98 → 990.10] Scott,
[990.14 → 991.02] I'll put a couple of hundred bucks
[991.02 → 992.10] in there because that way,
[992.50 → 993.24] if I did spend
[993.24 → 994.10] a couple of hundred bucks
[994.10 → 994.78] and, like,
[994.86 → 996.12] it hasn't shown up yet
[996.12 → 996.96] and then I, like,
[997.02 → 998.06] forget about it for a month
[998.06 → 999.14] because that could happen,
[999.52 → 1000.56] then I won't pay,
[1000.64 → 1002.20] I won't pay interest on it.
[1003.06 → 1003.42] Yeah,
[1003.46 → 1004.78] so just to keep going through this topic.
[1004.78 → 1005.96] It's not financial advice.
[1006.76 → 1007.04] But yeah,
[1007.12 → 1008.50] so we pushed a fix,
[1008.54 → 1009.56] it shouldn't be happening anymore,
[1009.72 → 1011.02] all users have been refunded,
[1011.06 → 1011.94] it might take some time
[1011.94 → 1012.78] to show up in your account,
[1013.10 → 1014.44] I know for sure
[1014.44 → 1015.40] that a bunch of users
[1015.40 → 1016.64] have already seen the money
[1016.64 → 1017.50] show up in their accounts,
[1017.86 → 1019.52] so hopefully that's happening to you.
[1019.82 → 1021.00] If it doesn't happen to you
[1021.00 → 1022.00] and you wait a little bit
[1022.00 → 1022.90] and it's still not there,
[1023.26 → 1024.20] please reach out to support.
[1024.20 → 1026.04] We really do want everyone
[1026.04 → 1026.96] to be taken care of.
[1027.08 → 1027.18] Yeah.
[1027.28 → 1028.24] I'm sorry about this,
[1028.30 → 1028.98] we apologize.
[1031.68 → 1032.08] Conrad,
[1032.26 → 1032.38] oh,
[1033.82 → 1034.46] Conrad,
[1034.58 → 1037.18] go for it,
[1037.18 → 1037.48] go for it,
[1037.48 → 1037.78] go for it.
[1038.56 → 1040.00] Conrad helpfully pointed out
[1040.00 → 1041.30] that payments are dated,
[1041.44 → 1042.16] so if the transaction
[1042.16 → 1043.32] doesn't go through for four days,
[1043.40 → 1043.94] it's still marked
[1043.94 → 1044.86] as the day you submit it,
[1045.22 → 1046.42] but it's still,
[1046.66 → 1046.84] like,
[1047.24 → 1048.40] there's still a mental toll,
[1048.86 → 1049.14] right,
[1049.14 → 1050.80] because you're sitting there
[1050.80 → 1051.48] not knowing
[1051.48 → 1053.00] if you've received it
[1053.00 → 1055.08] and for all the good it do you
[1055.08 → 1056.18] that we dated it
[1056.18 → 1057.38] for the day of the refund
[1057.38 → 1057.82] or whatever,
[1058.02 → 1059.08] it doesn't help give you
[1059.08 → 1059.80] peace of mind
[1059.80 → 1060.96] that you've been sorted out
[1060.96 → 1063.12] and it doesn't help us
[1063.12 → 1064.68] immediately know that,
[1064.80 → 1065.00] oh yeah,
[1065.04 → 1066.18] we've got all the bugs sorted
[1066.18 → 1067.06] and we've got,
[1067.70 → 1068.22] okay,
[1068.36 → 1069.06] the bugs are sorted,
[1069.16 → 1069.88] but it doesn't help us
[1069.88 → 1070.72] immediately know
[1070.72 → 1072.48] if all the attempts
[1072.48 → 1073.70] to process these refunds
[1073.70 → 1074.52] have actually gone through
[1074.52 → 1076.48] because not every fund's transfer
[1076.48 → 1077.80] goes through successfully,
[1077.80 → 1080.40] so it just is a long delay
[1080.40 → 1081.50] where instead of us
[1081.50 → 1082.02] being able to go,
[1082.12 → 1082.24] okay,
[1082.30 → 1082.60] here we go,
[1082.66 → 1083.08] one shot,
[1083.18 → 1083.28] yep,
[1083.32 → 1084.02] we've sent them all,
[1084.68 → 1085.60] confirm and let us know
[1085.60 → 1086.10] you're good,
[1086.52 → 1087.06] we have to go,
[1087.18 → 1087.32] okay,
[1087.38 → 1087.50] well,
[1087.54 → 1088.24] we sent them all,
[1089.20 → 1090.24] now we play
[1090.24 → 1091.50] the waiting game.
[1093.50 → 1093.90] Yeah.
[1096.84 → 1097.20] Okay,
[1097.42 → 1097.96] going to keep going
[1097.96 → 1098.52] through the topic.
[1099.30 → 1099.66] Yeah,
[1099.86 → 1100.82] we have at least
[1100.82 → 1102.68] one frustrated user
[1102.68 → 1104.48] in the Flow point chat.
[1104.48 → 1109.04] experience of waiting months?
[1109.30 → 1109.82] What the heck?
[1109.90 → 1110.40] That's insane.
[1111.62 → 1113.04] If you got something
[1113.04 → 1114.32] like overdraft fees
[1114.32 → 1114.86] or whatever,
[1117.38 → 1117.74] you know,
[1118.12 → 1119.10] reach out to support.
[1119.42 → 1121.78] We'll try to help
[1121.78 → 1122.40] in some way.
[1122.48 → 1123.42] I actually don't know
[1123.42 → 1124.46] if we can do anything
[1124.46 → 1124.96] about that.
[1125.20 → 1125.40] Oh, yeah.
[1125.48 → 1126.20] We can't do much,
[1126.24 → 1126.66] but we can probably
[1126.66 → 1127.46] give them free time.
[1127.52 → 1127.90] Oh, okay.
[1127.96 → 1128.44] Yeah, that could be.
[1128.44 → 1130.86] We can try to help
[1130.86 → 1131.74] in some way.
[1132.30 → 1134.58] I would kind of caution
[1134.58 → 1135.18] just like,
[1135.36 → 1136.46] if it's that tight,
[1136.62 → 1137.72] maybe just don't.
[1138.76 → 1139.08] But,
[1140.00 → 1140.38] you know.
[1141.20 → 1141.88] Which to be clear
[1141.88 → 1143.00] is not us like,
[1143.20 → 1143.52] you know,
[1143.74 → 1144.62] trying to shirk
[1144.62 → 1145.82] responsibility for this,
[1145.92 → 1147.36] but also it is a position
[1147.36 → 1148.12] that we have.
[1148.28 → 1148.66] We have to take care of you.
[1148.74 → 1149.48] It is a position
[1149.48 → 1150.56] that we've taken before
[1150.56 → 1152.04] that if money is super tight,
[1152.50 → 1154.82] you should use it for food.
[1155.38 → 1156.64] You can always cancel now
[1156.64 → 1157.60] and come back later.
[1157.60 → 1159.44] The exclusives will be there.
[1160.30 → 1161.34] So, you'll be able
[1161.34 → 1161.78] to go back
[1161.78 → 1162.38] and watch the ones
[1162.38 → 1163.78] you might have temporarily missed
[1163.78 → 1164.20] or whatever.
[1164.74 → 1166.56] We're not trying to
[1166.56 → 1168.76] push people that hard,
[1168.96 → 1169.22] you know.
[1169.38 → 1170.54] Like, I really appreciate
[1170.54 → 1171.20] all the subscriptions.
[1171.48 → 1171.86] It's like,
[1172.12 → 1172.74] it's very meaningful.
[1172.94 → 1173.78] It helps keep people
[1173.78 → 1174.64] at Float plane employed,
[1174.74 → 1175.26] all that kind of stuff.
[1175.30 → 1175.72] It's great.
[1176.06 → 1176.82] It's fantastic.
[1176.96 → 1177.76] Thank you for being subscribed.
[1178.00 → 1178.58] I just, I don't.
[1179.08 → 1180.04] It just,
[1180.42 → 1181.66] it makes me sad hearing that
[1181.66 → 1182.34] and I don't want people
[1182.34 → 1183.08] to be in that situation.
[1183.12 → 1184.42] Luke doesn't want to be sad.
[1185.24 → 1185.42] Yeah.
[1185.70 → 1187.02] Don't make Luke sad.
[1187.02 → 1187.58] Yeah, this is,
[1187.58 → 1188.28] this is selfish.
[1188.62 → 1188.90] This is,
[1189.02 → 1189.70] this is for me.
[1189.70 → 1190.08] It's all about Luke.
[1190.20 → 1191.02] It's not for you.
[1191.04 → 1191.74] Hold on, I'm gonna,
[1191.84 → 1192.76] I'm hitting the button.
[1192.76 → 1193.80] This is purely only for me.
[1194.02 → 1194.46] Is that like,
[1194.56 → 1195.16] move the button,
[1195.20 → 1196.04] move the button, Dan.
[1196.04 → 1196.82] You have to move it.
[1196.84 → 1197.22] Yeah, this is,
[1197.32 → 1199.46] I actually don't care
[1199.46 → 1200.58] about your financial situation.
[1200.80 → 1202.02] I just don't want to be sad.
[1202.16 → 1202.46] Okay?
[1202.46 → 1203.92] So figure it out.
[1204.64 → 1205.78] It's still on me, Dan.
[1206.98 → 1207.90] You know what?
[1208.06 → 1209.10] It's probably fine.
[1211.30 → 1213.68] Indonesian and float plane chat says,
[1214.02 → 1216.68] Western Union is shockingly fast and cheap
[1216.68 → 1218.00] for anything below $10,000.
[1218.36 → 1219.68] It's nearly instantly transferred.
[1220.28 → 1221.80] And I guess that's my point though,
[1222.06 → 1222.50] is like,
[1222.74 → 1224.12] I can't go anywhere
[1224.12 → 1225.94] in a major metropolitan centre
[1225.94 → 1226.98] without tripping over
[1226.98 → 1228.30] Western Union locations.
[1228.30 → 1231.26] I shouldn't need Western Union.
[1231.96 → 1232.12] Like,
[1232.38 → 1235.08] it should just be easy.
[1235.22 → 1235.96] It should just be built
[1235.96 → 1237.60] right into my banking app
[1237.60 → 1238.16] on my phone
[1238.16 → 1239.00] and I should just be able
[1239.00 → 1240.22] to just do it to anywhere.
[1241.06 → 1242.04] I don't get it.
[1244.92 → 1246.12] You wouldn't like him
[1246.12 → 1246.96] when he's sad.
[1248.36 → 1250.50] I would also say
[1250.50 → 1251.72] that with this update,
[1251.88 → 1252.90] there is a good thing.
[1253.36 → 1254.34] Peter pushed a feature
[1254.34 → 1256.50] enabling auto-generated subtitles,
[1256.88 → 1257.40] which is cool.
[1257.40 → 1258.42] They're not currently
[1258.42 → 1259.48] GPU accelerated,
[1259.76 → 1260.82] so we'll have to
[1260.82 → 1262.18] switch that over later
[1262.18 → 1263.54] and we'll make them
[1263.54 → 1264.98] higher quality at that time.
[1265.86 → 1267.08] They're pretty okay
[1267.08 → 1267.76] for now though.
[1268.90 → 1269.42] Creators,
[1269.60 → 1270.24] including us,
[1270.32 → 1271.04] would still be,
[1271.46 → 1271.64] like,
[1271.82 → 1273.28] would have better subtitles
[1273.28 → 1274.22] if we generate them
[1274.22 → 1274.62] ourselves,
[1274.94 → 1276.58] but it is there.
[1276.92 → 1278.44] So nebulously in the future,
[1278.56 → 1279.96] this will get better,
[1280.26 → 1281.48] but yeah,
[1281.60 → 1283.68] hopefully that helps things.
[1283.92 → 1284.14] Oh,
[1284.20 → 1284.82] that's cool.
[1284.82 → 1287.08] But just to be clear,
[1287.18 → 1288.26] I'm a little bit confused.
[1288.36 → 1288.80] There's some people
[1288.80 → 1289.86] talking in Flow play chat.
[1290.48 → 1292.66] You don't have to file tickets
[1292.66 → 1294.64] to get your refunds.
[1294.68 → 1295.80] You don't have to.
[1296.46 → 1299.12] It would actually be bad for us,
[1299.18 → 1299.64] but I mean,
[1299.84 → 1300.46] you do you.
[1300.80 → 1302.22] You don't have to communicate
[1302.22 → 1303.26] with your credit card company
[1303.26 → 1303.92] to get refunds.
[1303.92 → 1304.56] You don't have to do anything.
[1304.68 → 1306.04] We are issuing the refunds
[1306.04 → 1306.70] for you.
[1306.78 → 1308.12] We are sending the money back.
[1308.30 → 1309.64] You don't have to do anything.
[1309.76 → 1310.66] It's all being handled.
[1310.90 → 1311.36] Hey, Luke.
[1311.70 → 1312.10] Yeah.
[1312.22 → 1313.18] What are we using
[1313.18 → 1314.28] for these auto subtitles?
[1314.44 → 1315.56] These are perfect.
[1316.16 → 1316.44] Whisper.
[1317.46 → 1317.86] Really?
[1318.66 → 1320.32] Is that one auto subtitled
[1320.32 → 1321.20] or is that one
[1321.20 → 1322.96] an uploaded subtitle?
[1323.32 → 1323.52] Oh,
[1323.62 → 1324.16] good question.
[1324.32 → 1324.80] I don't know.
[1326.56 → 1326.96] Yeah,
[1326.96 → 1327.50] not sure.
[1327.58 → 1329.14] Do we do uploaded subtitles?
[1330.78 → 1332.28] I believe for some videos.
[1332.40 → 1333.14] That's not a process
[1333.14 → 1334.48] that I'm super a part of,
[1334.64 → 1335.42] but I know,
[1335.48 → 1336.62] I know for some videos
[1336.62 → 1337.26] that they do.
[1337.66 → 1337.90] I mean,
[1337.90 → 1339.26] this one didn't have a script,
[1339.40 → 1340.04] so there would have been
[1340.04 → 1341.48] no convenient way to do it
[1341.48 → 1342.64] other than watching the video
[1342.64 → 1343.58] and then...
[1343.58 → 1343.78] Well,
[1343.94 → 1344.90] we have built,
[1345.06 → 1345.96] like the...
[1345.96 → 1346.38] Tyler,
[1346.66 → 1347.56] a while ago,
[1347.76 → 1350.14] built a UI
[1350.14 → 1351.88] for using Whisper
[1351.88 → 1353.16] because the editors
[1353.16 → 1353.66] didn't want to use
[1353.66 → 1354.06] command line,
[1354.14 → 1354.98] which is understandable.
[1356.58 → 1356.96] Yeah,
[1357.06 → 1357.24] okay,
[1357.38 → 1359.08] so Tor Dirk is saying,
[1359.22 → 1359.60] historically,
[1359.80 → 1360.46] you only upload
[1360.46 → 1361.00] for flow points.
[1361.14 → 1362.06] I don't run
[1362.06 → 1362.88] subtitles myself,
[1362.88 → 1364.36] so I'm not super up-to-date
[1364.36 → 1365.12] on which ones we do
[1365.12 → 1365.86] and on which ones we don't.
[1366.10 → 1366.92] I just know that some of them...
[1366.92 → 1367.34] Chewy's in the chat.
[1367.34 → 1368.20] Chewy's in the chat.
[1368.26 → 1368.48] He says,
[1368.58 → 1369.54] we only do manual subs
[1369.54 → 1371.50] on Flow plane for exclusives.
[1371.52 → 1372.30] So that one would have
[1372.30 → 1373.00] been auto-generated.
[1373.02 → 1373.18] Yeah,
[1373.22 → 1373.42] wow.
[1373.48 → 1374.30] We are also,
[1374.66 → 1375.46] just so people know,
[1375.74 → 1377.04] we are trying to run this
[1377.04 → 1378.98] on all of our backlog
[1378.98 → 1379.82] over time.
[1379.96 → 1380.80] A ton of the backlog
[1380.80 → 1381.54] already has it,
[1381.74 → 1383.84] but not 100% of them.
[1384.42 → 1385.04] I often do,
[1385.14 → 1385.38] actually,
[1385.44 → 1386.24] I use a specific card.
[1386.42 → 1387.98] How did it get shoo,
[1388.30 → 1388.60] Luke?
[1389.30 → 1389.66] Like,
[1389.88 → 1391.34] that's really impressive.
[1391.94 → 1392.74] Whisper's fantastic,
[1392.86 → 1393.00] yeah.
[1393.10 → 1394.52] So this is a feature
[1394.52 → 1396.50] and you think it's good now,
[1396.56 → 1397.30] it'll be even better
[1397.30 → 1397.84] in the future.
[1399.04 → 1399.48] So,
[1400.44 → 1400.68] yeah.
[1401.14 → 1401.62] Hopefully,
[1401.86 → 1402.44] let me make sure
[1402.44 → 1403.40] I'm reading this right
[1403.40 → 1405.00] and not saying things
[1405.00 → 1405.92] that Peter's going to be
[1405.92 → 1406.84] mad at me over.
[1408.20 → 1409.30] Give me one second.
[1409.84 → 1410.24] Wow.
[1410.24 → 1411.32] I'm,
[1411.36 → 1411.76] I'm,
[1412.02 → 1413.04] I'm impressed.
[1413.94 → 1414.68] I'm impressed.
[1415.28 → 1416.14] That's pretty cool.
[1416.40 → 1418.04] It's spelled shoo right.
[1419.58 → 1419.98] Yep.
[1420.30 → 1420.50] Yeah,
[1420.62 → 1421.56] Chewy just confirmed
[1421.56 → 1422.80] that that specific video
[1422.80 → 1424.08] is auto-generated
[1424.08 → 1424.60] in the CMS.
[1425.22 → 1425.62] Cool.
[1425.78 → 1426.06] Nice.
[1426.40 → 1426.86] Because I,
[1427.02 → 1427.20] man,
[1427.28 → 1428.08] and it was getting things
[1428.08 → 1429.38] like GPU right.
[1429.72 → 1429.94] Like,
[1430.04 → 1430.34] I've,
[1430.64 → 1432.50] the YouTube auto subtitles
[1432.50 → 1433.56] have been kind of a mess.
[1433.62 → 1434.24] Do we have any idea
[1434.24 → 1434.92] what they're using?
[1435.96 → 1436.62] I have no clue.
[1436.98 → 1438.04] Probably not Whisper,
[1438.12 → 1438.26] though,
[1438.32 → 1439.54] because Whisper's from OpenAI.
[1440.54 → 1441.08] Got him.
[1441.42 → 1441.72] So I,
[1441.78 → 1441.96] like,
[1442.16 → 1443.30] seriously doubt it.
[1444.54 → 1445.36] Let me see.
[1445.50 → 1446.12] What do you say?
[1446.34 → 1446.58] Wow.
[1446.70 → 1447.00] Super cool.
[1447.00 → 1447.16] Yeah,
[1447.18 → 1448.56] it's running Whisper small
[1448.56 → 1449.14] right now,
[1449.28 → 1449.84] which I,
[1449.84 → 1451.66] I believe is,
[1452.14 → 1452.78] if I remember,
[1452.86 → 1453.42] it's been a while
[1453.42 → 1454.38] since I've messed with Whisper,
[1454.46 → 1455.06] but if I remember correctly,
[1455.10 → 1458.12] that's not their best version.
[1458.42 → 1458.68] So,
[1459.20 → 1460.30] once we get to GPUs,
[1460.30 → 1461.16] we should be able to run
[1461.16 → 1462.06] better than that.
[1462.36 → 1462.94] Let me see.
[1463.34 → 1465.64] Whisper quality settings.
[1465.64 → 1469.96] Yeah,
[1470.06 → 1470.86] model size.
[1470.96 → 1471.68] They have tiny,
[1471.86 → 1472.14] base,
[1472.26 → 1472.58] small,
[1472.74 → 1473.00] medium,
[1473.08 → 1473.56] and large.
[1473.68 → 1475.00] Larger models are more accurate,
[1475.12 → 1475.72] but slower.
[1476.22 → 1477.50] Smaller models are faster.
[1477.84 → 1479.50] The large model is the most accurate,
[1479.60 → 1482.00] but requires a GPU for practical use.
[1482.16 → 1483.66] So we're running small,
[1483.76 → 1484.96] which is kind of in the middle,
[1485.50 → 1486.90] because tiny and base are smaller than it.
[1486.90 → 1487.42] Tell me something.
[1487.50 → 1488.66] We have that meeting
[1488.66 → 1490.06] that we've started doing on,
[1490.10 → 1491.36] I think it's a monthly basis,
[1491.36 → 1493.84] where it's like a cross-pollination
[1493.84 → 1495.24] of video ideas meeting.
[1495.94 → 1496.00] Like,
[1496.24 → 1497.24] should we be,
[1497.30 → 1498.68] should we be doing an LTT
[1498.68 → 1499.74] where we build,
[1499.92 → 1500.42] like,
[1500.44 → 1501.72] a Whisper GPU server
[1501.72 → 1503.10] and we Huck it in the server room?
[1503.20 → 1503.28] Like,
[1503.32 → 1503.66] can be just?
[1503.66 → 1503.78] Yeah,
[1503.80 → 1504.24] we want to.
[1504.66 → 1504.96] Okay.
[1505.16 → 1505.84] And so we could just.
[1505.84 → 1507.04] That was a project.
[1507.60 → 1507.92] Oh,
[1508.02 → 1508.26] cool.
[1508.40 → 1508.62] Okay.
[1508.74 → 1509.34] I'd be so down.
[1509.36 → 1510.58] Which got,
[1510.66 → 1510.98] like,
[1511.16 → 1512.42] kind of semi-cancelled
[1512.42 → 1513.42] due to reasons,
[1513.70 → 1515.70] and we're trying to get back,
[1515.98 → 1517.26] because we want to do more stuff
[1517.26 → 1517.76] than just,
[1517.76 → 1518.12] like,
[1518.72 → 1519.30] you know,
[1519.38 → 1520.22] Whisper translations.
[1520.86 → 1521.30] Sure.
[1521.52 → 1521.72] Yeah,
[1521.74 → 1522.12] I'm down.
[1522.64 → 1522.96] There's,
[1523.04 → 1523.48] there's also,
[1523.58 → 1523.76] like,
[1524.04 → 1525.52] let's look at CPU
[1525.52 → 1526.84] versus GPU transcoding
[1526.84 → 1528.32] in 2025 or six
[1528.32 → 1529.52] by the time it actually happens,
[1529.54 → 1530.22] if we're being honest.
[1530.66 → 1531.08] Yeah,
[1531.08 → 1531.26] well.
[1531.32 → 1531.86] But let's like,
[1532.04 → 1532.56] let's look at,
[1532.56 → 1533.70] what are the quality difference
[1533.70 → 1534.42] these days?
[1534.86 → 1535.20] Because,
[1535.36 → 1535.58] like,
[1535.72 → 1535.92] the
[1535.96 → 1536.18] the
[1536.18 → 1537.16] the standard knowledge
[1537.16 → 1538.10] when we started Flow plane
[1538.10 → 1538.52] was like,
[1538.70 → 1540.04] CPU transcoding was the way
[1540.04 → 1541.00] because GPU transcoding
[1541.00 → 1541.64] looked like junk.
[1542.14 → 1543.48] I don't think that's true anymore.
[1543.62 → 1544.96] Because as far as my understanding,
[1545.08 → 1545.52] you're right.
[1546.16 → 1547.62] Or maybe there's a difference,
[1547.70 → 1548.38] but it's so minor
[1548.38 → 1549.48] that users aren't going to notice.
[1549.62 → 1550.32] That's my understanding.
[1550.34 → 1551.34] So we could transcode on GPU,
[1551.34 → 1553.20] that would go way faster.
[1553.66 → 1555.16] I would love to say cheaper.
[1555.50 → 1556.44] I don't know if that's true
[1556.44 → 1557.38] because card prices
[1557.38 → 1559.06] are just so through the darn roof.
[1560.34 → 1560.54] Yeah,
[1560.54 → 1560.78] but yeah,
[1560.82 → 1561.94] it's an interesting thing.
[1562.02 → 1564.10] The cards you need to video transcode
[1564.10 → 1565.16] aren't necessarily
[1565.16 → 1566.66] that,
[1567.06 → 1567.32] well,
[1567.42 → 1568.08] they're expensive,
[1568.08 → 1569.34] but not in like a
[1569.64 → 1570.78] from like a commercial,
[1570.78 → 1572.06] you know,
[1572.14 → 1573.16] use standpoint.
[1573.38 → 1573.52] They're,
[1573.60 → 1574.86] they're not that ludicrous.
[1574.86 → 1575.98] Like you're not had to,
[1576.04 → 1578.50] going to have to go and spend $5,000 on like,
[1578.62 → 1579.26] or five,
[1579.38 → 1581.40] $50,000 on an H200
[1581.40 → 1582.34] or something like that.
[1582.40 → 1583.86] I really don't think so.
[1584.36 → 1584.92] Like that would,
[1585.02 → 1585.90] that's just for AI.
[1586.02 → 1586.92] Like at most,
[1586.98 → 1588.50] you'd be picking up like a quadrat equivalent,
[1588.64 → 1589.80] whatever they call those these days.
[1590.52 → 1591.16] I just,
[1591.26 → 1593.14] I feel like there's been knock-on effects
[1593.14 → 1594.08] that have made a lot of things
[1594.08 → 1594.60] really expensive.
[1594.60 → 1595.10] But I mean,
[1595.10 → 1597.26] I'm also pretty interested in,
[1597.26 → 1600.52] I don't know,
[1600.74 → 1601.68] getting the budget for this
[1601.68 → 1602.74] or getting people to send us cards
[1602.74 → 1603.64] might be pretty annoying,
[1603.86 → 1604.86] but it would be really cool
[1604.86 → 1606.82] to do it across the vendors as well.
[1608.48 → 1609.22] Like what's that,
[1609.28 → 1611.02] what's that Intel thing,
[1611.12 → 1612.08] that Intel cluster?
[1612.42 → 1612.66] Battle Mage?
[1612.66 → 1613.60] That has a really cool name.
[1614.02 → 1614.20] No,
[1614.46 → 1614.64] no,
[1614.96 → 1615.88] oh shoot,
[1615.94 → 1616.54] what is it called?
[1617.46 → 1617.90] No,
[1617.96 → 1618.92] Battle Mage is just the
[1620.12 → 1620.64] oh man,
[1620.64 → 1621.48] Battle Axe?
[1621.56 → 1621.68] No.
[1622.08 → 1622.46] Dang it.
[1623.62 → 1624.80] Intel Battle
[1624.80 → 1628.42] four cards cluster.
[1628.68 → 1629.58] What's it called?
[1630.98 → 1631.22] Dang,
[1631.34 → 1632.10] Battle Matrix.
[1632.72 → 1633.28] Battle Matrix,
[1633.44 → 1633.68] that's it.
[1633.76 → 1634.80] Such a sick name,
[1634.86 → 1635.06] dude.
[1635.16 → 1635.82] Oh my goodness.
[1636.08 → 1637.18] Like it'd be fun to,
[1637.18 → 1638.92] to try out on Battle Matrix,
[1639.10 → 1639.74] see what happens.
[1641.44 → 1642.10] I don't know.
[1642.28 → 1642.64] It just,
[1643.22 → 1643.48] that would,
[1643.52 → 1644.10] that would be cool.
[1644.24 → 1644.90] I would like it.
[1644.96 → 1645.60] I don't know how many people
[1645.60 → 1646.56] are going to be that interested
[1646.56 → 1647.20] in watching it,
[1647.24 → 1648.32] but I think it would be really fun.
[1649.38 → 1649.92] But yeah,
[1649.92 → 1650.92] auto-generated subtitles.
[1651.84 → 1652.96] Hopefully that's helpful for people.
[1652.96 → 1653.36] Um,
[1653.96 → 1656.24] and it's been chugging through the backlog
[1656.24 → 1657.56] for a while now.
[1658.20 → 1658.60] Um,
[1659.02 → 1660.30] and yeah,
[1660.44 → 1660.92] check it out.
[1661.52 → 1661.62] Yeah,
[1661.64 → 1661.96] but I guess,
[1662.04 → 1662.22] I mean,
[1662.24 → 1663.68] even if we finish the backlog,
[1663.88 → 1664.90] there would still be a benefit
[1664.90 → 1667.30] to us building like a badass server
[1667.30 → 1668.06] to do it because
[1668.06 → 1670.28] that way we can do it again
[1670.28 → 1671.38] with the larger model
[1671.38 → 1672.98] and then as it improves,
[1672.98 → 1674.00] we could do it again
[1674.00 → 1675.34] and then we can keep refining,
[1675.46 → 1676.18] keep refining it.
[1676.66 → 1676.88] Yep.
[1677.06 → 1677.40] Cause,
[1677.62 → 1679.38] cause just like Chewy pointed out,
[1679.64 → 1680.20] um,
[1680.52 → 1681.56] it does become
[1681.56 → 1682.94] not as great
[1682.94 → 1683.80] when there's like
[1683.80 → 1684.98] a group conversation.
[1685.62 → 1686.02] Um,
[1686.42 → 1687.26] like it's,
[1687.30 → 1687.60] it's,
[1687.66 → 1689.04] it's definitely not always perfect.
[1689.12 → 1689.26] It's,
[1689.36 → 1690.48] it has its downsides.
[1690.76 → 1691.20] Um,
[1691.22 → 1691.76] but yeah,
[1691.76 → 1692.68] it's pretty good.
[1692.76 → 1693.72] It's a lot better than nothing.
[1694.32 → 1694.76] Yeah.
[1695.88 → 1696.60] Super cool.
[1696.74 → 1697.00] Okay.
[1697.08 → 1697.56] And honestly,
[1697.62 → 1697.86] like,
[1697.96 → 1698.70] like you said,
[1698.78 → 1700.06] the YouTube one is
[1700.06 → 1702.06] really not great.
[1702.32 → 1702.96] So like,
[1703.08 → 1704.08] so that's what we're up against.
[1704.52 → 1704.92] Yeah,
[1704.92 → 1705.32] exactly.
[1708.02 → 1708.44] Dan,
[1708.48 → 1709.28] what are we supposed to be doing?
[1709.28 → 1710.68] Uh,
[1710.74 → 1711.46] about topic two?
[1712.38 → 1712.94] I mean,
[1713.18 → 1713.72] topic three.
[1714.38 → 1714.76] Sure.
[1715.00 → 1715.30] Yeah,
[1715.30 → 1715.64] we can,
[1715.74 → 1716.32] we can do it.
[1716.36 → 1717.30] We can do a third topic.
[1718.48 → 1718.92] Um,
[1719.36 → 1722.18] how about we talk about
[1722.18 → 1722.92] my terrible,
[1723.24 → 1723.56] awful,
[1723.68 → 1724.08] no good,
[1724.16 → 1725.14] very bad morning
[1725.14 → 1725.80] at the airport.
[1726.96 → 1728.38] So I had a recent trip
[1728.38 → 1729.10] down to,
[1729.72 → 1730.42] down yonder,
[1730.56 → 1731.36] California way
[1731.36 → 1734.20] and I was on my way back
[1734.20 → 1735.86] as part of this trip.
[1735.86 → 1737.12] I had to bring with me
[1737.12 → 1738.64] some electronic devices.
[1739.38 → 1739.82] Um,
[1740.24 → 1740.72] just,
[1740.84 → 1741.00] you know,
[1741.10 → 1741.34] for,
[1741.46 → 1742.18] for reference.
[1742.36 → 1742.64] Right.
[1743.38 → 1743.82] And,
[1743.90 → 1744.52] uh,
[1744.52 → 1745.20] so I,
[1745.22 → 1745.86] I ended up having,
[1745.94 → 1746.34] I think,
[1746.42 → 1746.64] you know,
[1746.64 → 1747.06] this Luke,
[1747.14 → 1748.90] but I almost never travel
[1748.90 → 1749.68] with a check bag.
[1750.18 → 1750.66] Uh,
[1750.72 → 1750.94] a
[1751.28 → 1753.08] I don't like the hassle
[1753.08 → 1754.92] of having a larger bag.
[1755.42 → 1755.86] B,
[1756.02 → 1757.56] I don't like my stuff
[1757.56 → 1759.52] being away from me.
[1759.94 → 1760.42] Um,
[1760.54 → 1763.18] just because it's super stressful
[1763.18 → 1764.44] having to worry about
[1764.44 → 1765.74] when I get to the other side,
[1765.74 → 1768.26] is my luggage actually going to be there?
[1768.26 → 1769.14] So if there's anything
[1769.14 → 1770.20] I can do to avoid it,
[1770.24 → 1772.40] I will not take anything more
[1772.40 → 1773.54] than a personal item backpack
[1773.54 → 1775.16] and then a carry-on bag.
[1776.54 → 1776.98] Um,
[1777.18 → 1777.70] in fact,
[1777.76 → 1778.14] actually,
[1778.26 → 1780.06] even my recent trip to Asia
[1780.06 → 1782.06] where I was gone for 11 days
[1782.06 → 1783.94] in Japan and China,
[1783.94 → 1786.54] I took only a little roller
[1786.54 → 1787.80] carry-on bag.
[1788.62 → 1789.10] Arguably,
[1789.18 → 1789.84] by the end of it,
[1790.08 → 1791.52] I could have smelled better
[1791.52 → 1792.28] than I did,
[1792.64 → 1794.34] but it's better than
[1794.34 → 1795.60] not having your luggage
[1795.60 → 1796.48] in my,
[1796.50 → 1797.02] in my book.
[1797.86 → 1798.84] And I just,
[1798.98 → 1799.94] I've travelled enough
[1799.94 → 1800.68] over the years
[1800.68 → 1801.72] and I've seen kind of
[1801.72 → 1803.00] everything that can go wrong
[1803.00 → 1804.36] and I've seen how it just
[1804.36 → 1805.94] kind of always seems to go wrong
[1805.94 → 1806.68] and I just,
[1806.80 → 1807.20] I hate it.
[1807.32 → 1807.56] Anyway,
[1808.04 → 1808.74] the point is,
[1808.84 → 1809.74] on this recent trip
[1809.74 → 1810.80] down California Way,
[1811.08 → 1813.80] I had to carry,
[1813.80 → 1814.46] uh,
[1814.54 → 1815.66] a checked bag
[1815.66 → 1817.94] because of all the electronic devices
[1817.94 → 1819.52] that I needed to bring with me
[1819.52 → 1820.52] for reference.
[1821.24 → 1821.64] Um,
[1821.64 → 1823.28] I had a couple desktop computers,
[1823.28 → 1824.78] I had a couple of,
[1824.78 → 1825.08] like,
[1825.16 → 1826.28] mobile devices.
[1827.04 → 1827.48] Anyway,
[1828.04 → 1828.74] going down,
[1829.08 → 1830.28] totally not a problem.
[1831.16 → 1831.64] But,
[1832.32 → 1833.72] I had a seven,
[1834.08 → 1835.84] seven and something
[1835.84 → 1836.44] a.m.
[1836.66 → 1836.98] flight,
[1837.22 → 1837.36] 7,
[1837.40 → 1838.60] 730 or something like that,
[1838.60 → 1839.52] or 720 a.m.
[1839.56 → 1840.84] flight coming back.
[1840.98 → 1841.26] So,
[1841.32 → 1842.52] I had to be at the airport
[1842.52 → 1843.46] a little bit before
[1843.46 → 1844.46] six in the morning
[1844.46 → 1846.02] and I go to check in
[1846.02 → 1847.66] and I,
[1847.70 → 1848.56] I put my bag up
[1848.56 → 1849.40] on the weighing thing
[1849.40 → 1850.26] and he's like,
[1850.30 → 1850.42] oh,
[1850.42 → 1851.28] you're two pounds over.
[1851.36 → 1851.60] I'm like,
[1851.66 → 1851.86] oh,
[1851.90 → 1852.08] shoot,
[1852.08 → 1852.42] okay,
[1852.52 → 1852.80] well,
[1853.30 → 1853.54] like,
[1853.98 → 1854.96] it's two pounds,
[1855.04 → 1855.92] does it really matter?
[1856.40 → 1857.34] And he's like,
[1857.56 → 1857.76] uh,
[1857.76 → 1857.96] yeah,
[1857.96 → 1858.44] is there anything
[1858.44 → 1859.74] that you can take out
[1859.74 → 1860.74] and put into your backpack?
[1860.94 → 1861.00] I'm like,
[1861.04 → 1861.50] all right,
[1861.58 → 1861.74] so,
[1861.84 → 1862.52] so I pull,
[1862.68 → 1863.22] because like,
[1863.62 → 1864.26] it's so,
[1865.74 → 1867.92] I'm sure
[1867.92 → 1869.84] the airlines have reasons
[1869.84 → 1870.86] for doing things
[1870.86 → 1871.88] the way that they do them,
[1872.32 → 1873.60] but I think
[1873.60 → 1874.34] Lufthansa
[1874.34 → 1876.38] is the only airline
[1876.38 → 1877.30] that I have
[1877.30 → 1878.94] ever seen
[1878.94 → 1880.38] where they even
[1880.38 → 1882.20] weigh your personal item.
[1882.94 → 1884.24] And they're so intense
[1884.24 → 1884.72] about it,
[1884.76 → 1884.92] dude.
[1885.54 → 1886.80] They're crazy.
[1887.16 → 1888.54] Have we ever told the story
[1888.54 → 1889.96] of what we had to do
[1889.96 → 1890.74] that one time?
[1891.88 → 1893.98] I don't think so.
[1895.24 → 1895.76] Every,
[1895.88 → 1896.96] every time I've ever
[1896.96 → 1897.86] flown with them afterwards,
[1897.86 → 1898.98] I've had like a minor
[1898.98 → 1899.68] amount of trauma
[1899.68 → 1900.50] where I'm just like,
[1900.84 → 1902.36] I'm like holding my bags up,
[1902.42 → 1903.00] trying to just like
[1903.00 → 1904.02] physically determine
[1904.02 → 1904.66] if they're,
[1904.66 → 1905.40] if they're overweight
[1905.40 → 1905.82] and like,
[1906.04 → 1907.72] I'll put a crazy amount
[1907.72 → 1908.92] of stuff in my pockets.
[1909.10 → 1910.02] I'll just like jam
[1910.02 → 1911.44] my pockets full of things.
[1911.72 → 1912.14] It's like,
[1912.24 → 1912.68] no,
[1913.02 → 1914.64] I'm not going to be overweight,
[1914.96 → 1916.20] especially if I'm by myself
[1916.20 → 1917.34] and I can't do what we did.
[1917.44 → 1918.88] So there was four of us
[1918.88 → 1921.28] and a couple of us
[1921.28 → 1922.16] were way overweight
[1922.16 → 1923.64] and a couple of us
[1923.64 → 1924.86] were way underweight
[1924.86 → 1926.54] and we basically were like,
[1926.60 → 1926.84] okay,
[1926.84 → 1927.02] well,
[1927.02 → 1927.84] does this matter?
[1928.06 → 1929.30] Because on average,
[1929.40 → 1930.04] we are all,
[1930.16 → 1930.90] we're on average,
[1930.90 → 1931.78] we're underweight.
[1932.16 → 1932.22] Under.
[1932.22 → 1933.08] And they were like,
[1933.78 → 1934.20] yes,
[1934.32 → 1934.98] it matters.
[1935.20 → 1936.98] So at the bag check,
[1937.34 → 1937.78] we had,
[1937.90 → 1938.64] we opened up
[1938.64 → 1939.82] all our luggages
[1939.82 → 1941.94] and then balanced around
[1941.94 → 1943.38] all the crap in them,
[1943.78 → 1945.14] put them all back together
[1945.14 → 1946.06] and then put them
[1946.06 → 1946.70] on the weigh station.
[1946.80 → 1947.04] We're like,
[1947.08 → 1947.46] okay,
[1947.58 → 1949.16] did this make a difference
[1949.16 → 1950.34] to the plane being able
[1950.34 → 1951.46] to take off or not?
[1953.34 → 1953.78] Anyway,
[1953.98 → 1954.94] that's a whole,
[1955.04 → 1956.16] that's a whole separate,
[1956.38 → 1957.62] that's a whole separate story.
[1959.20 → 1959.84] So anyway,
[1959.84 → 1960.16] I'm like,
[1960.20 → 1960.38] okay,
[1960.44 → 1960.60] well,
[1960.66 → 1961.66] like does the extra two,
[1961.66 → 1962.44] two pounds matter?
[1962.52 → 1962.78] He's like,
[1962.88 → 1963.08] yes,
[1963.10 → 1963.34] it does.
[1963.44 → 1963.60] I'm like,
[1963.60 → 1963.90] okay,
[1963.96 → 1964.14] fine.
[1964.62 → 1965.78] As I'm like getting ready
[1965.78 → 1966.94] to like open it up
[1966.94 → 1968.00] and rebalance,
[1968.10 → 1968.56] put some stuff
[1968.56 → 1969.24] into my backpack,
[1969.58 → 1970.06] he goes,
[1970.14 → 1971.52] do you have any electronics items?
[1971.94 → 1972.26] Any,
[1972.52 → 1973.50] any fuels,
[1973.72 → 1974.14] you know,
[1974.16 → 1974.90] any sharp items,
[1975.04 → 1975.34] whatever,
[1975.50 → 1975.66] you know,
[1975.66 → 1976.68] like the standard questions
[1976.68 → 1977.64] that they ask you.
[1977.66 → 1977.84] I'm like,
[1977.88 → 1978.02] oh,
[1978.46 → 1978.66] well,
[1978.66 → 1979.64] I do have some electronics
[1979.64 → 1980.02] and he goes,
[1980.08 → 1980.14] oh,
[1980.14 → 1980.24] well,
[1980.24 → 1981.06] you can't have any of those
[1981.06 → 1981.34] in there.
[1982.28 → 1982.86] And I go,
[1983.42 → 1984.38] what do you mean?
[1984.42 → 1985.30] It's like,
[1985.38 → 1985.56] I,
[1985.84 → 1986.92] they don't have batteries.
[1987.76 → 1988.36] And he goes,
[1988.64 → 1989.22] you can't,
[1989.22 → 1990.40] you can't have any electronics
[1990.40 → 1991.12] in your check bag.
[1991.58 → 1992.44] And I go,
[1993.50 → 1994.36] no,
[1994.46 → 1994.68] I'm,
[1994.68 → 1995.78] I'm quite certain
[1995.78 → 1997.16] that it's fine to have
[1997.16 → 1998.64] electronics in my bag
[1998.64 → 2000.34] as long as they don't have batteries.
[2000.34 → 2000.88] Like I,
[2000.88 → 2002.96] I have a desktop computer.
[2002.96 → 2007.26] I am so glad
[2007.26 → 2009.40] that I had the presence of mind
[2009.40 → 2014.02] to say I have a desktop computer
[2014.02 → 2017.20] because if I had told them
[2017.20 → 2018.78] what my real concern was,
[2018.78 → 2022.66] if I had said my entire check bag
[2022.66 → 2025.18] is packed to the gills with electronics,
[2025.18 → 2027.92] I don't know if I would have gotten on my flight
[2027.92 → 2031.30] because I went back and forth with this guy.
[2031.30 → 2033.08] I kid you not
[2033.08 → 2034.72] over half a dozen,
[2034.82 → 2036.44] probably over 10 times,
[2037.14 → 2039.26] like just having probably
[2039.26 → 2041.82] the most inane conversation
[2041.82 → 2043.40] that I have ever had
[2043.40 → 2045.66] with a retail worker of any kind.
[2046.82 → 2047.94] I haven't even,
[2048.02 → 2049.58] I haven't even gotten it out of the bag yet,
[2049.70 → 2050.56] but I basically,
[2050.82 → 2051.54] by this point,
[2051.62 → 2052.18] I'm going,
[2052.62 → 2053.36] hey,
[2053.44 → 2053.58] no,
[2053.66 → 2055.76] I really don't think that's right.
[2056.00 → 2056.72] And he goes,
[2057.38 → 2058.36] I'm telling you,
[2058.50 → 2058.68] sir,
[2058.68 → 2061.62] you can't have any computers,
[2061.72 → 2063.32] you can't have any electronics in your bag.
[2063.64 → 2066.94] So I happen to be at a bag check.
[2067.30 → 2069.32] So I pick up the piece of paper
[2069.32 → 2070.92] that's sitting in a plastic stand
[2070.92 → 2071.18] and I go,
[2071.26 → 2072.36] can you show me on here
[2072.36 → 2074.60] where it says I can't have any electronics?
[2075.20 → 2075.86] And he goes,
[2075.94 → 2076.76] I'm telling you.
[2076.82 → 2077.18] And I'm like,
[2077.34 → 2078.02] right,
[2078.08 → 2079.02] I hear you telling me,
[2079.24 → 2080.44] but what I really need you to do
[2080.44 → 2082.02] is show me on here
[2082.02 → 2083.80] where it says I can't have electronics.
[2084.12 → 2085.72] And he points at it like vaguely.
[2085.78 → 2086.54] He goes right there.
[2086.54 → 2087.14] And I'm like,
[2087.46 → 2088.04] hold on.
[2088.58 → 2091.60] That says electronics with lithium batteries.
[2092.36 → 2093.82] It's a desktop computer.
[2094.04 → 2095.28] It doesn't have any battery.
[2095.32 → 2096.28] And he like cuts me off.
[2096.32 → 2096.96] He interrupts me.
[2097.02 → 2097.26] He goes,
[2097.88 → 2099.32] I told you there's no electronics.
[2099.40 → 2099.58] I go,
[2099.64 → 2099.76] okay,
[2099.76 → 2100.02] look,
[2101.06 → 2102.94] like by this point,
[2102.96 → 2103.74] I'm just like,
[2104.54 → 2104.94] okay,
[2105.28 → 2105.92] two deep breaths.
[2106.50 → 2108.38] I would like to speak to a supervisor.
[2108.46 → 2108.66] He goes,
[2108.76 → 2109.82] I am the supervisor.
[2110.02 → 2110.58] And I go,
[2110.74 → 2110.90] no,
[2111.20 → 2111.72] I'm like,
[2111.90 → 2112.22] okay,
[2112.76 → 2114.36] then we really need to resolve this.
[2114.36 → 2117.50] Because this does not say no electronics.
[2117.68 → 2120.24] It says no electronics with batteries.
[2120.36 → 2120.54] And he goes,
[2120.68 → 2120.96] sir,
[2121.00 → 2121.74] I'm done with you.
[2122.30 → 2125.26] And he like basically throws my passport down onto the counter.
[2126.72 → 2128.28] And I'm sitting here going like,
[2129.28 → 2132.28] this is actually pretty fucked up right now.
[2132.50 → 2134.64] How you can be a supervisor
[2134.64 → 2136.92] at Air Canada
[2136.92 → 2138.82] handling bag check
[2138.82 → 2140.60] and not fucking know
[2140.60 → 2144.14] that if someone is trying to move an electronic device,
[2144.54 → 2146.50] like how would anybody have gotten to like
[2146.50 → 2148.72] LTX whale lands in the past
[2148.72 → 2151.10] if there's no way to check a computer
[2151.10 → 2152.30] in luggage?
[2152.52 → 2152.64] I mean,
[2152.68 → 2152.90] we've,
[2152.90 → 2154.88] we've flown with computers a ton of times.
[2154.96 → 2156.22] We've flown with cameras and stuff too.
[2156.28 → 2157.38] We just take the batteries out.
[2157.44 → 2158.16] Like it's not,
[2158.32 → 2158.60] uh,
[2158.64 → 2158.92] well,
[2159.02 → 2159.46] yeah,
[2160.04 → 2160.46] how would,
[2160.46 → 2162.76] how would a documentary film crew
[2162.76 → 2164.32] ever do anything?
[2164.66 → 2165.76] If you couldn't,
[2165.76 → 2169.00] if you couldn't check electronics in a bag,
[2169.02 → 2169.96] you think they carry them all.
[2170.12 → 2171.88] So this guy literally,
[2172.12 → 2173.84] so by this point,
[2173.86 → 2174.16] I'm like,
[2174.20 → 2174.34] well,
[2174.36 → 2174.62] look,
[2174.68 → 2174.78] no,
[2174.80 → 2175.68] I have to fly.
[2175.94 → 2177.68] Like we're not done here.
[2178.30 → 2178.66] Do you,
[2178.78 → 2180.40] do you want me to take it out and show you?
[2180.44 → 2180.70] He goes,
[2180.90 → 2181.10] well,
[2181.10 → 2182.20] I don't see how that's going to help,
[2182.20 → 2182.70] but fine.
[2183.04 → 2184.12] So I pull it out.
[2184.56 → 2186.26] I have this desktop computer.
[2186.26 → 2186.56] I'm like,
[2186.56 → 2187.10] this is it.
[2187.10 → 2187.48] And he's like,
[2187.52 → 2187.64] yeah,
[2187.64 → 2188.56] you can't fly with that.
[2189.24 → 2189.54] I'm like,
[2189.56 → 2190.06] you have to be,
[2190.18 → 2191.32] you have to be kidding me right now.
[2191.38 → 2191.52] Yes,
[2191.56 → 2192.04] I can.
[2192.04 → 2192.62] And he's like,
[2192.64 → 2193.92] I'm not going to argue with you anymore.
[2194.54 → 2195.42] And I'm just like,
[2195.80 → 2197.06] so what do you want me to do?
[2197.50 → 2198.28] Like carry it?
[2198.50 → 2198.96] He's like,
[2199.02 → 2199.34] fine.
[2200.40 → 2200.78] I'm like,
[2201.06 → 2201.56] okay.
[2203.00 → 2203.50] And like,
[2203.54 → 2204.10] realistically,
[2204.70 → 2205.46] like I could have,
[2205.54 → 2208.50] I could have phoned Air Canada support and been like,
[2208.54 → 2212.06] can you explain to this f***ING a**hole that like,
[2212.10 → 2214.42] I'm allowed to take a computer in my bag?
[2215.78 → 2216.10] Like,
[2216.10 → 2218.02] but I don't know if I would have made my flight.
[2218.14 → 2219.44] I don't know how long that would have taken.
[2220.42 → 2221.42] So instead,
[2222.34 → 2223.24] thankfully,
[2223.46 → 2223.78] again,
[2223.78 → 2229.08] I had the presence of mind to not disclose that my entire bag was full of electronics.
[2229.40 → 2230.92] So I opened it up like,
[2231.00 → 2231.20] like,
[2231.36 → 2232.86] so he couldn't see into my bag,
[2233.34 → 2234.86] took out the one computer,
[2235.76 → 2236.50] closed it,
[2236.50 → 2238.06] and was like,
[2238.22 → 2238.40] well,
[2238.40 → 2239.36] now I'm underweight.
[2239.78 → 2240.48] And I just,
[2240.62 → 2243.88] so I had to carry this stupid f***ING computer with me.
[2244.58 → 2245.90] I'm sitting there in the
[2245.90 → 2255.10] I'm sitting there at the gate at like a little café table with my stupid desktop computer on the table while I'm eating my French toast at SFO.
[2255.10 → 2258.78] And then I go, and I get on the plane.
[2259.08 → 2261.02] And it's a good thing I had the commuter bag,
[2261.92 → 2262.22] right?
[2262.52 → 2264.46] Because if I'd had the OG backpack,
[2264.86 → 2271.54] I was on the tiniest like tin can plane coming back here that had no room in the overhead for anything.
[2271.54 → 2273.18] Like it was completely full.
[2273.36 → 2275.16] So if I had had the OG backpack,
[2275.38 → 2280.52] I wouldn't have even been able to fit the computer under the chair in front of me.
[2280.60 → 2282.78] But I was able to put the computer down there,
[2282.92 → 2284.54] put my backpack onto it.
[2284.90 → 2285.60] And I'm just like,
[2286.56 → 2288.16] come on,
[2288.22 → 2288.56] man.
[2290.60 → 2292.70] It was amazing seeing all this.
[2293.24 → 2295.54] Everyone in the chat during the intro of the video was like,
[2295.60 → 2298.04] when Linus says someone's objectively wrong about something,
[2298.08 → 2298.80] it means subjective.
[2299.06 → 2299.46] No,
[2299.58 → 2300.40] that is not.
[2300.40 → 2301.82] That is not true.
[2302.66 → 2304.76] Maybe it has happened on occasion,
[2305.40 → 2306.40] but no,
[2306.80 → 2309.14] I was objectively right.
[2309.38 → 2312.94] There is nothing wrong with flying with electronics in your check bag.
[2313.32 → 2315.14] It's batteries that are the concern.
[2315.60 → 2317.46] And this computer was so old,
[2317.56 → 2319.90] it wouldn't have even had a live CMOS battery,
[2320.18 → 2324.44] let alone any kind of like lithium pouch cells or anything like that.
[2325.14 → 2325.78] Unbelievable.
[2325.78 → 2325.90] Unbelievable.
[2326.32 → 2328.78] And Parapodia,
[2329.50 → 2331.44] or whatever your name is in float plane chat says,
[2331.52 → 2334.98] did you call Air Canada after they can track the guy down and give him some education?
[2335.14 → 2335.32] Yes,
[2335.42 → 2336.02] I did.
[2336.08 → 2339.40] I emailed them or like I filled out their form.
[2339.52 → 2341.60] I gave the guy's name, and I was just like,
[2341.66 → 2341.90] look,
[2342.16 → 2342.90] this is not,
[2342.90 → 2344.32] I managed to get on my flight.
[2344.32 → 2347.28] This is not about like retribution or whatever,
[2348.06 → 2353.82] but he does need to know because if he's supposed to be the supervisor that is handling people's check bags,
[2353.98 → 2358.20] then he needs to learn either the regulations or he needs to learn to read.
[2358.20 → 2359.60] I didn't say it that way.
[2359.92 → 2368.84] But I basically just said he needs to familiarize himself with the regulations for what is allowed to go in a check bag because this could have been very disastrous for my return home.
[2370.22 → 2370.66] Man,
[2371.36 → 2373.60] every one of my recent trips has had something.
[2373.72 → 2373.82] Dude,
[2374.08 → 2376.66] did we talk on Welsh about triple C yet?
[2379.20 → 2380.08] Triple C?
[2380.12 → 2380.38] Yeah.
[2380.46 → 2381.06] I don't think so.
[2381.18 → 2382.84] So my recent chip trip to China,
[2383.16 → 2386.10] I got a really nice battery bank confiscated.
[2386.10 → 2388.26] I was really frustrated.
[2388.50 → 2389.98] It was a really expensive one.
[2390.08 → 2391.68] Like one of those big high cap,
[2391.74 → 2392.90] I think you green makes it.
[2393.34 → 2394.78] And it was like 60,
[2394.92 → 2396.78] 45 or 60 Watts power delivery.
[2396.98 → 2402.04] So I could run basically anything I wanted off of it indefinitely like DOG ally or like,
[2402.14 → 2404.48] like my laptop or whatever.
[2405.18 → 2406.60] Why was it confiscated?
[2406.76 → 2410.58] So it was confiscated because in China they have a new,
[2410.80 → 2410.98] no,
[2411.06 → 2413.00] it was not because it was more than a hundred watt-hours.
[2413.12 → 2413.56] Scrappy DP.
[2413.56 → 2414.28] It was airline,
[2414.42 → 2415.02] airline safe.
[2415.02 → 2417.20] So it was like 99.98 watt-hours or whatever.
[2417.84 → 2418.20] Um,
[2418.34 → 2426.10] but they have a new regulation in China called triple C, and they no longer accept any kinds
[2426.10 → 2431.68] of international certifications for the safety of lithium battery devices.
[2431.68 → 2432.46] But the
[2432.54 → 2434.42] the really like,
[2435.84 → 2436.16] Oh,
[2436.36 → 2439.30] I don't mind rules and regulations,
[2439.30 → 2440.50] right?
[2440.86 → 2445.98] Thoughtfully applied rules and regulations help keep society functioning.
[2445.98 → 2447.64] They help keep people safe.
[2447.64 → 2449.92] They can do all kinds of good things.
[2450.06 → 2452.76] They can also do bad things,
[2452.76 → 2459.92] but they can also just be arbitrary and kind of stupid.
[2459.92 → 2460.98] And in this case,
[2461.48 → 2463.28] I don't know,
[2463.38 → 2463.70] man,
[2463.94 → 2464.22] I,
[2464.38 → 2464.86] um,
[2465.76 → 2467.24] it feels a little arbitrary.
[2467.24 → 2467.32] Sorry.
[2467.74 → 2469.98] So rather than accepting what,
[2469.98 → 2470.14] what,
[2470.14 → 2471.22] what are some of the other ones?
[2471.22 → 2471.42] Uh,
[2471.48 → 2474.30] UL has like a certification for battery banks,
[2474.38 → 2474.66] I think,
[2474.72 → 2474.92] right?
[2475.52 → 2475.76] Uh,
[2475.86 → 2476.38] CSA.
[2476.68 → 2476.92] Actually,
[2476.96 → 2478.52] I don't know if CSA is the Canadian one.
[2478.64 → 2478.96] CSA.
[2479.24 → 2480.66] I don't know if they do battery banks,
[2480.66 → 2482.72] but a lot of the time in Canada,
[2482.72 → 2483.56] um,
[2483.56 → 2487.64] I think there are categories of products that you don't have to have CSA as long as they have like a
[2487.64 → 2487.72] uh,
[2487.84 → 2489.30] an accepted international one.
[2489.44 → 2489.82] What,
[2489.86 → 2490.08] what are,
[2490.18 → 2491.06] what are some of the other ones?
[2491.90 → 2492.34] Um,
[2492.56 → 2494.96] no one in chat is throwing any at me here,
[2495.04 → 2495.38] but whatever.
[2495.46 → 2496.96] The point is that,
[2496.96 → 2497.72] um,
[2497.96 → 2498.26] you know,
[2498.68 → 2501.70] various countries have various certifications for these devices.
[2501.70 → 2502.62] And in general,
[2502.74 → 2505.94] as long as it is certified by some sort of reputable body,
[2505.96 → 2506.46] it's fine.
[2506.72 → 2507.20] Now,
[2507.24 → 2509.02] in fairness to the Chinese authorities,
[2509.02 → 2510.58] there have been some incidents,
[2510.76 → 2512.70] especially recently where there have been some,
[2512.70 → 2513.14] some,
[2513.14 → 2514.76] lithium batteries that have exploded.
[2514.92 → 2518.80] And anchor had that recent big controversy where they had to recall,
[2518.80 → 2522.38] like how many millions upon millions of dollars worth of battery banks.
[2522.38 → 2522.82] Because they,
[2522.92 → 2524.04] they had some issues with the cells.
[2524.46 → 2524.90] Yeah.
[2525.10 → 2530.46] But my problem with all of this is that the way that triple C works is that it's,
[2530.46 → 2532.12] it's a stamp on the outside of the device.
[2532.12 → 2535.68] Because I was looking all this up because I got my stupid battery bank confiscated.
[2535.68 → 2537.36] So I was trying to figure out what the heck was going on.
[2537.78 → 2540.14] And all they checked when I got on,
[2540.32 → 2543.12] when I got through security was if it has a triple C stamp on it.
[2543.14 → 2544.62] But as it turns out,
[2544.62 → 2548.80] the only way that you can verify if the triple C is actually valid is you have to
[2548.80 → 2551.34] enter a serial number into a site to check,
[2551.34 → 2552.96] but nobody was doing that anyway.
[2552.96 → 2555.36] And here's where it gets even more arbitrary.
[2555.36 → 2556.68] You are allowed to,
[2556.74 → 2558.74] because I flew into China with my battery bank,
[2558.84 → 2559.34] obviously.
[2559.34 → 2559.68] Right?
[2560.10 → 2563.96] So you're allowed to fly into China without a triple C battery bank.
[2564.36 → 2570.42] You are allowed to fly out of China without triple C on your battery bank.
[2571.02 → 2576.46] The only reason I ran into trouble was because I was taking a domestic flight.
[2576.46 → 2585.14] So I can fly on a Chinese airline into China over the water on a long flight.
[2585.14 → 2587.42] And that's totally safe without triple C.
[2587.80 → 2590.56] I can fly on a Chinese airline somewhere else.
[2591.12 → 2592.22] And that's totally fine.
[2592.22 → 2594.10] But if I do a little hop,
[2594.18 → 2595.98] little one hour hop within China,
[2596.42 → 2596.58] well,
[2596.66 → 2598.58] you have to have triple C.
[2598.90 → 2600.12] You don't have triple C.
[2600.36 → 2601.88] You don't got boy.
[2603.16 → 2603.76] So I was,
[2603.84 → 2604.96] I was a little frustrated,
[2605.08 → 2605.74] a little frustrated.
[2605.74 → 2606.82] I got a free battery bank,
[2606.90 → 2607.06] dude,
[2607.18 → 2607.72] a little frustrated.
[2607.72 → 2608.78] And I'm not the only one.
[2608.88 → 2609.12] I mean,
[2609.12 → 2614.10] Chinese citizens don't always express their frustration with the Chinese government
[2614.10 → 2616.18] super vocally because,
[2616.34 → 2616.90] you know,
[2617.06 → 2618.96] might affect their social credit score or whatever else.
[2618.96 → 2626.28] but there has been a fair bit of frustration over triple C because it only,
[2626.56 → 2630.42] I think manufacturers only really started producing triple C certified battery
[2630.42 → 2631.84] banks like last year,
[2632.18 → 2632.60] 2024.
[2633.08 → 2639.18] So functionally what it did was it made every battery bank before like a year
[2639.18 → 2639.64] ago,
[2640.26 → 2642.32] e-waste if you hope to travel with it because,
[2642.66 → 2643.56] and this is the really,
[2643.82 → 2644.92] really frustrating part for me.
[2645.18 → 2647.54] It apparently applies to trains as well.
[2648.44 → 2648.88] Like,
[2649.66 → 2650.78] on an airliner,
[2651.08 → 2651.86] I get it.
[2652.38 → 2655.36] A fire is actually a disaster,
[2655.82 → 2656.06] you know,
[2656.12 → 2656.50] in a
[2656.50 → 2659.48] in a pressurized tin can,
[2659.90 → 2660.16] you know,
[2660.26 → 2663.26] ripping across the face of the earth at,
[2663.38 → 2663.72] you know,
[2664.14 → 2665.86] tens of thousands of feet above the surface,
[2665.98 → 2666.14] right?
[2666.18 → 2666.56] Like that,
[2666.84 → 2667.02] yeah,
[2667.04 → 2668.10] that makes a ton of sense to me.
[2668.70 → 2669.56] On a train?
[2670.54 → 2670.90] Like,
[2671.00 → 2672.72] I have a battery bank in my backpack.
[2673.04 → 2673.22] Like,
[2673.30 → 2673.92] really?
[2675.02 → 2675.74] I don't know,
[2675.82 → 2676.04] man.
[2676.32 → 2676.48] Like,
[2676.54 → 2676.70] yeah,
[2676.70 → 2679.38] obviously a lithium fire anywhere is bad,
[2679.38 → 2680.22] but I just,
[2680.28 → 2680.74] at that point,
[2680.78 → 2682.20] why not ban them from cars?
[2682.36 → 2683.46] Why not ban them from buses?
[2683.64 → 2684.36] Why not ban them from,
[2684.80 → 2686.64] why not ban them in the library at school?
[2686.76 → 2687.06] Like I,
[2687.44 → 2687.62] where,
[2687.86 → 2689.96] why are we drawing such an arbitrary line?
[2689.96 → 2693.92] Yeah,
[2694.26 → 2694.64] it's,
[2694.64 → 2695.04] um,
[2696.72 → 2699.16] lithium batteries are interesting.
[2699.94 → 2700.34] They're,
[2700.34 → 2700.70] thanks,
[2700.76 → 2704.20] but also everywhere and not generally a problem.
[2704.20 → 2704.72] So it's,
[2704.72 → 2705.02] it's,
[2705.10 → 2705.78] it's strange.
[2706.18 → 2706.68] Um,
[2707.16 → 2710.76] battery fires on planes are brutal.
[2711.12 → 2711.66] Oh yeah.
[2712.34 → 2712.94] Um,
[2712.98 → 2713.30] oh yeah.
[2713.38 → 2713.88] So like,
[2713.90 → 2714.66] I get it.
[2714.66 → 2715.66] Yeah.
[2717.72 → 2718.12] Yeah.
[2718.32 → 2718.68] I don't know.
[2718.76 → 2719.50] I kind of get it.
[2719.58 → 2722.52] I understand a country wanting to have more control over that,
[2722.62 → 2724.32] but it seems inconsistently applied.
[2725.26 → 2725.36] No,
[2725.46 → 2725.78] you're a blue.
[2725.86 → 2728.02] I didn't talk to anyone about social credit score.
[2728.12 → 2729.72] I was mostly Memling.
[2730.40 → 2730.84] Um,
[2731.36 → 2731.90] however,
[2731.90 → 2739.24] it is very clear in public interviews with people in China that they are more careful about what they say than,
[2739.24 → 2740.12] um,
[2740.12 → 2741.52] people in some other places.
[2741.52 → 2742.00] I was,
[2742.06 → 2742.24] uh,
[2742.24 → 2744.86] I was reading this fascinating interview with,
[2745.04 → 2745.34] um,
[2746.08 → 2746.96] this guy who's,
[2747.04 → 2749.34] he's like a Chinese Donald Trump impersonator.
[2749.86 → 2750.98] Have you seen this guy?
[2751.94 → 2752.42] Uh,
[2752.48 → 2753.20] I think so.
[2753.82 → 2754.06] Uh,
[2754.14 → 2754.66] yeah,
[2754.76 → 2754.98] I'm,
[2755.04 → 2755.98] I'm going to see who did,
[2756.10 → 2756.24] uh,
[2756.24 → 2758.64] who did the profile of him recently?
[2760.32 → 2760.80] Um,
[2762.30 → 2763.14] this guy,
[2763.28 → 2764.22] this is great.
[2765.38 → 2768.12] He's got the body language nailed down.
[2768.64 → 2769.30] You guys,
[2769.36 → 2770.56] you guys should check out his videos,
[2770.72 → 2770.94] but,
[2771.06 → 2771.42] um,
[2771.98 → 2779.24] his interview is very fascinating because he's extremely careful about not getting his,
[2779.38 → 2782.80] his social channels taken down.
[2782.88 → 2783.28] He's like,
[2783.36 → 2783.66] yeah,
[2783.78 → 2784.08] I,
[2784.30 → 2784.60] you know,
[2784.94 → 2786.88] I'm not trying to offend anybody.
[2786.88 → 2788.02] This is not political.
[2788.26 → 2789.78] I'm just doing a voice.
[2790.10 → 2790.96] That's all.
[2791.06 → 2791.18] No,
[2791.24 → 2791.80] really though.
[2791.94 → 2792.70] It's not political.
[2792.86 → 2794.28] I'm not trying to insult anybody.
[2794.64 → 2795.04] Please.
[2795.18 → 2796.10] Nobody get me in trouble.
[2796.40 → 2797.24] It's just a voice.
[2797.76 → 2798.26] Um,
[2798.26 → 2799.86] like really leans into it.
[2799.92 → 2802.56] And maybe his fear is totally,
[2802.56 → 2803.62] you know,
[2803.76 → 2805.66] unfounded, or maybe it's not.
[2805.72 → 2806.10] I don't know.
[2806.14 → 2806.68] I don't live there.
[2806.68 → 2810.04] All right,
[2810.04 → 2810.28] Dan,
[2810.58 → 2811.52] what do you want to talk about next?
[2812.24 → 2816.74] Why don't we do a couple merch messages and the CW stuff?
[2817.96 → 2818.30] Sure,
[2818.34 → 2818.84] we can do that.
[2818.84 → 2820.00] So if you're new,
[2820.96 → 2824.84] merch messages are the way to interact with the WAN show.
[2825.00 → 2825.18] Hey,
[2825.52 → 2826.94] there's one right there.
[2827.36 → 2827.92] Look at that.
[2828.36 → 2828.76] Uh,
[2828.76 → 2833.26] all you got to do to send a merch message is head over to LTT store.com.
[2833.34 → 2835.10] Looks a little something like this.
[2835.26 → 2835.58] Whoa,
[2835.96 → 2837.00] we got some promos.
[2837.16 → 2840.54] Look at all these banners and promos and all this exciting stuff,
[2840.62 → 2841.82] but we'll get to that a little bit later.
[2841.92 → 2842.22] First,
[2842.62 → 2846.90] I'm just going to show you guys all you got to do to send a merch message is add this fine,
[2846.98 → 2848.46] juicy piece of chicken to your cart.
[2849.62 → 2850.98] Head on over to your cart.
[2851.62 → 2852.62] And when we're live,
[2852.68 → 2853.66] you'll see a merch message.
[2853.92 → 2857.10] You just go ahead and fill in what you want to say to the show.
[2857.22 → 2858.14] Put a nice little colour.
[2858.26 → 2861.50] Decide if you want to have your first name and last initial,
[2861.64 → 2864.66] or if you want to be anonymous and go ahead and place your order.
[2864.78 → 2868.00] It will go to producer Dan who will put it down there.
[2868.00 → 2871.44] If you have a little shout-out, or he'll reply to it himself,
[2871.44 → 2876.12] or he will curate it for me and Luke to answer.
[2876.12 → 2882.54] We like merch messages because they're kind of like what streamers do where you throw your money at the screen, and maybe they acknowledge you.
[2882.58 → 2883.94] Maybe they don't.
[2884.06 → 2886.32] Except you get fine,
[2886.42 → 2887.88] high quality merchandise in the mail,
[2887.96 → 2889.84] regardless of what happens with your message.
[2889.96 → 2890.12] Dan,
[2890.18 → 2892.32] do you want to show us a couple of curated ones to show how that works?
[2892.58 → 2892.78] Yeah,
[2892.78 → 2893.10] sure.
[2893.28 → 2897.20] This one's from an and on any smart home content coming up soon.
[2897.34 → 2899.54] I find it to be super entertaining.
[2900.04 → 2900.34] Yes,
[2900.76 → 2903.60] there will be lots of smart home content.
[2903.82 → 2905.22] I still have to fix my house.
[2905.22 → 2906.74] And in addition to that,
[2906.74 → 2916.58] I think we're going to take a pretty different approach to the tech house that we are in the process of shopping for right now.
[2916.58 → 2921.54] So Colton actually has a list of five houses sitting in my inbox right now.
[2921.62 → 2924.30] I've been a little bit busy this week and I haven't gotten a chance to get to it.
[2924.66 → 2927.46] And email is a totally valid way for him to send me a task like that.
[2927.70 → 2928.34] Um,
[2928.78 → 2931.24] so I have five houses that I'm supposed to review.
[2931.82 → 2933.32] And once I do that,
[2933.38 → 2938.14] I think the first episode is going to be going around and kind of shopping and comparing.
[2938.14 → 2940.46] And I mean,
[2940.60 → 2952.16] I feel like this is one of those things where as much as it would be prudent for us to take our time over a span of like a couple of months and,
[2952.16 → 2955.96] and shop and shop and shop till we drop and find the perfect,
[2956.08 → 2956.68] perfect house.
[2957.78 → 2958.50] I mean,
[2958.66 → 2961.08] the whole content is we're going to fix it up anyway.
[2961.26 → 2961.72] So I'm,
[2961.80 → 2962.28] I'm kind of,
[2962.32 → 2963.30] I haven't told anybody this,
[2963.36 → 2964.06] but I'm kind of leaning.
[2964.18 → 2964.42] Okay.
[2964.42 → 2966.22] If we have five finalists,
[2966.22 → 2970.04] we go see them all in one day, and we make an offer.
[2970.08 → 2971.96] And that's the stakes for that video.
[2972.66 → 2974.22] So we make an offer on one of them.
[2974.60 → 2975.00] Um,
[2975.00 → 2977.16] so that'll be the very first episode.
[2977.48 → 2980.28] And then the second one will probably be okay.
[2981.10 → 2986.86] Let's take a deeper look at this thing and kind of lay out some concept of a plan.
[2987.36 → 2987.52] And I,
[2987.64 → 2987.76] yeah,
[2987.80 → 2989.66] an idea for a plan at the very least.
[2989.74 → 2989.88] Yeah.
[2990.00 → 2990.58] Like at,
[2990.78 → 2994.40] and then it would be kind of fun if we put our plan off,
[2994.42 → 2994.84] on like,
[2995.12 → 2995.42] you know,
[2995.44 → 2997.46] a big poster board or something like that.
[2997.46 → 3002.68] Or we made like kind of a task list of everything that we wanted to do and then kind of draw a few things out.
[3002.68 → 3003.94] And then at the very end,
[3004.04 → 3005.52] we pull the poster board back out.
[3005.64 → 3006.96] We pull out our cardboard list, and we go,
[3007.08 → 3007.32] okay,
[3007.66 → 3009.08] how close did we get?
[3009.74 → 3009.98] Um,
[3009.98 → 3011.40] I'm really looking forward to it.
[3011.46 → 3015.92] And I think we're going to take a bit of a different approach to the smart home stuff compared to what we did at my house,
[3016.02 → 3018.52] where it's very DIY.
[3018.52 → 3030.94] Whereas I could see us finding a decent ecosystem that isn't too overpriced and locking into an ecosystem for something that we actually intend for someone else to use.
[3033.16 → 3033.72] Hmm.
[3033.72 → 3037.78] As long as that ecosystem allows local control,
[3038.30 → 3039.74] that will always be,
[3039.74 → 3042.08] that will always be a red line.
[3042.82 → 3043.26] Always.
[3043.62 → 3043.92] I was like,
[3043.98 → 3044.22] Ooh,
[3044.22 → 3045.26] you don't like that.
[3045.64 → 3045.96] Uh,
[3046.32 → 3046.56] cool.
[3046.86 → 3047.04] Yeah.
[3047.12 → 3047.44] No,
[3047.44 → 3047.60] no,
[3047.60 → 3047.74] no,
[3047.74 → 3048.00] no,
[3048.00 → 3048.14] no,
[3048.14 → 3048.18] no,
[3048.18 → 3048.30] no.
[3050.14 → 3050.58] Okay.
[3050.76 → 3052.06] Let's go gambling.
[3052.72 → 3053.00] What?
[3054.32 → 3055.48] Let's go gambling.
[3055.52 → 3056.42] Let's go gambling.
[3056.94 → 3057.94] What are you guys talking about?
[3058.26 → 3059.68] Don't worry about it.
[3059.68 → 3062.78] Let's go gambling as video content creators.
[3062.92 → 3067.40] How long did it take for you all to get used to your faces being on camera?
[3067.76 → 3068.18] Why is it?
[3068.26 → 3069.04] Let's go gambling.
[3069.54 → 3070.22] I don't know.
[3071.06 → 3071.62] Oh,
[3072.34 → 3080.44] there's been some discussion on the Subreddit and other various places about the current promo that we're running.
[3080.44 → 3086.24] So why don't I just interrupt and talk about the promo that's running on LTT store.com.
[3086.24 → 3091.12] We are kicking off November with a holiday loot drop.
[3091.26 → 3091.74] That's right.
[3091.78 → 3101.94] My friends spend a hundred dollars or more on LTT store.com, and you will have about a one in 10 chance to win a prize until November 26th.
[3101.94 → 3102.92] That is an estimate.
[3103.16 → 3106.84] We do not know for sure because we don't know exactly how many people will enter,
[3107.28 → 3108.12] but it is an estimate.
[3108.12 → 3114.52] You can win either a pair of Sennheiser HD 550 headphones like the ones that I am wearing right now,
[3114.52 → 3116.00] or if you're really lucky,
[3116.66 → 3120.22] you'll win an Asus DOG Xbox Ally.
[3120.50 → 3121.50] That says Ally,
[3121.64 → 3122.62] but this one is black.
[3122.84 → 3124.44] Is it the Ally or the Ally X?
[3124.54 → 3126.02] Somebody please hit me with the answer.
[3126.86 → 3128.56] I'm pretty sure it's Ally X.
[3128.84 → 3129.26] It's the X.
[3129.36 → 3130.08] It's the black one,
[3130.14 → 3130.98] the performant one.
[3131.14 → 3131.40] Cool.
[3131.40 → 3137.28] That is pretty solid odds for buying stuff that you might've been thinking of picking up anyway,
[3137.52 → 3138.64] like the glitch desk pad,
[3138.72 → 3140.72] which is now available on the U S site.
[3142.72 → 3145.40] It's also a great excuse to talk yourself into.
[3148.60 → 3149.08] Oh,
[3151.22 → 3151.40] hold on.
[3152.54 → 3152.68] Where?
[3152.94 → 3153.12] Oh,
[3153.34 → 3153.50] what?
[3155.16 → 3156.36] I'm a little bit confused.
[3156.50 → 3156.60] Oh,
[3156.62 → 3157.22] I need to refresh,
[3157.38 → 3157.92] refresh the page.
[3158.36 → 3158.98] There we go.
[3159.66 → 3160.40] The vanity.
[3160.40 → 3161.32] That's right.
[3161.92 → 3163.04] It's when V three,
[3163.28 → 3168.24] it's back and redder than ever in true when show colours as voted by you.
[3168.38 → 3170.04] You may not remember this,
[3170.10 → 3174.62] but we actually put this to a community vote ages ago asking,
[3174.78 → 3181.10] do you guys want another black and orange hoodie like our previous when hoodies in the past?
[3181.46 → 3190.34] Or do you want us for once to make a when show garment that is actually in the correct colour scheme for when show?
[3190.40 → 3193.36] The when show has always been red.
[3194.24 → 3196.94] It was never actually orange.
[3197.82 → 3199.72] We just put LTT colours on this,
[3199.82 → 3200.10] on the
[3200.16 → 3200.90] on the hoodie,
[3201.02 → 3203.00] despite it being land show,
[3203.12 → 3203.40] which is,
[3203.56 → 3204.56] which is a different colour scheme.
[3204.78 → 3206.32] The community over.
[3206.48 → 3206.80] Okay.
[3206.80 → 3207.08] See,
[3207.14 → 3207.72] this is funny.
[3207.80 → 3208.22] This is funny.
[3208.56 → 3211.26] Breakdown 1923 says that isn't red though.
[3211.80 → 3212.12] Okay.
[3212.16 → 3213.14] Here's the thing.
[3213.34 → 3213.86] Our person,
[3214.28 → 3224.48] our perception of colour is affected by all the other colours and stimuli around us to the point where this is hilarious.
[3224.48 → 3224.96] Uh,
[3224.96 → 3226.64] back before we had,
[3226.74 → 3227.04] you know,
[3227.10 → 3230.70] like real graphic design people and stuff,
[3230.70 → 3231.52] uh,
[3231.56 → 3232.60] we used to have,
[3232.72 → 3233.98] I think the tech was red.
[3234.36 → 3234.64] Luke,
[3234.68 → 3235.16] is that right?
[3236.60 → 3237.12] Uh,
[3237.68 → 3238.22] Ooh,
[3238.52 → 3239.92] that sounds right.
[3240.06 → 3240.84] The point is,
[3240.90 → 3241.58] the point is,
[3242.06 → 3246.58] even though LTT actually has orange as it's,
[3246.58 → 3247.18] um,
[3247.44 → 3248.52] as it's pop colour,
[3248.52 → 3251.28] we had to make it red on here.
[3251.28 → 3252.28] If I recall correctly,
[3252.28 → 3254.96] because otherwise it didn't look orange,
[3255.08 → 3256.66] orange looked yellow or something.
[3256.66 → 3258.56] Like there was a whole issue around it.
[3258.64 → 3259.36] I thought it was the logo that was off.
[3259.40 → 3261.34] It's been a long time since this was an issue,
[3261.34 → 3262.02] but the
[3262.18 → 3262.30] yeah,
[3262.40 → 3262.54] the
[3262.54 → 3262.90] the
[3262.90 → 3268.66] the LTT colours on the forum had to be wrong in order for people to think that they were right.
[3268.84 → 3269.06] Yeah.
[3269.10 → 3269.54] Um,
[3269.54 → 3271.18] because they looked and like this,
[3271.22 → 3271.40] this,
[3271.48 → 3273.74] this was not one or two people.
[3273.74 → 3275.26] This was effectively everybody.
[3275.26 → 3278.48] They looked super wrong just due to the other colours that were,
[3278.52 → 3278.92] around them.
[3278.92 → 3280.36] And we had to do something about it.
[3280.44 → 3282.50] I think that might still be a thing.
[3282.62 → 3283.82] I think the logo,
[3283.82 → 3285.54] I wonder if you like,
[3285.62 → 3285.96] um,
[3287.12 → 3288.38] if you're snipping tool,
[3288.38 → 3295.84] the logo on the forum and go into like paint or something and eyedropper the colour and then painted a bunch.
[3295.92 → 3297.26] Is it actually our orange?
[3297.58 → 3298.64] I can't remember.
[3298.82 → 3299.30] I'm sorry.
[3299.42 → 3299.58] Well,
[3299.68 → 3300.82] you want to do it right now?
[3300.82 → 3301.18] Not really.
[3301.34 → 3302.60] It's not that interesting.
[3303.12 → 3303.76] Sounds good.
[3303.82 → 3305.36] But at some point it was like that,
[3305.46 → 3306.08] where it was like,
[3306.12 → 3306.98] it was like red.
[3306.98 → 3307.78] Um,
[3307.78 → 3309.70] and then Ed was working on,
[3309.70 → 3310.28] uh,
[3310.28 → 3311.64] some other asset.
[3311.84 → 3312.56] And I was like,
[3312.60 → 3312.76] whoa,
[3312.84 → 3312.98] whoa,
[3313.02 → 3313.16] whoa.
[3313.20 → 3314.12] Why is everything red?
[3314.14 → 3314.50] And he's like,
[3314.52 → 3314.60] oh,
[3314.62 → 3317.44] I just eyedroppered like the forum banner header.
[3317.50 → 3319.26] And that was when the investigation started.
[3319.32 → 3319.80] And I was like,
[3319.84 → 3321.40] what the heck is going on here?
[3321.42 → 3322.34] Because our,
[3322.38 → 3323.84] our accent colour is orange.
[3324.72 → 3325.12] Anyway,
[3325.62 → 3327.56] the eye is down in the corner right now.
[3327.56 → 3329.00] Like it's clearly red.
[3329.78 → 3330.18] Okay.
[3330.42 → 3331.12] Very funny.
[3331.12 → 3331.44] Dan,
[3331.52 → 3332.06] put it back.
[3332.06 → 3333.28] I'm trying to make it orange.
[3334.36 → 3334.96] Fine.
[3335.34 → 3335.84] Fine.
[3336.26 → 3337.16] No fun allowed,
[3337.26 → 3337.64] Sancho.
[3338.74 → 3340.00] Messing with everybody.
[3340.58 → 3340.98] Uh,
[3341.04 → 3341.32] okay.
[3341.38 → 3344.66] There's also a ton of other cool upgrades.
[3345.10 → 3345.70] Yes,
[3345.74 → 3348.14] there are slightly fewer pockets actually,
[3348.36 → 3352.04] but the pocket placement is much more intentional and streamlined.
[3352.20 → 3352.62] For example,
[3353.02 → 3358.88] instead of having two Kana pockets and accidentally sticking your hand in the other one,
[3358.88 → 3365.96] we just made it one, and we changed how the zipper is embedded to reduce any chance of the adhesive pulling off.
[3366.30 → 3368.28] We also added a zippered chest pocket.
[3368.42 → 3369.04] Where are you at?
[3369.20 → 3370.64] There you are right there.
[3370.74 → 3370.90] Yeah.
[3371.54 → 3372.36] Zippered chest pocket.
[3372.56 → 3376.80] We switched the sides of the arm pocket to make it easier to use for,
[3376.92 → 3377.52] sorry,
[3377.62 → 3378.34] right-handed people.
[3378.44 → 3378.56] Sorry,
[3378.64 → 3378.92] lefties.
[3378.98 → 3379.12] Sorry,
[3379.24 → 3379.48] soft,
[3379.54 → 3383.28] soft pause to make it easier on right-handed people who are the majority.
[3383.42 → 3383.64] I'm sorry.
[3383.96 → 3384.42] Um,
[3384.42 → 3389.74] and we made the back pocket back here even bigger.
[3389.88 → 3391.12] We also changed up the fabric.
[3391.24 → 3392.26] It's a heavier weight.
[3392.34 → 3393.88] Cotton Terry feels more premium.
[3394.02 → 3396.30] It's also a little bit warmer, and we improved the hood.
[3396.56 → 3400.48] It's now a three panel design that just sits a little bit better on your head.
[3400.54 → 3402.38] We also made it a little bit more fun.
[3402.58 → 3403.88] We made the draw cord tips,
[3404.24 → 3404.66] um,
[3404.76 → 3409.50] hexagons because they're the best of guns and the eyelets are shaped like the best of gone as well.
[3409.50 → 3413.20] And obviously it's red and gray voted by you.
[3413.32 → 3415.64] We even did a newsletter blog post on it.
[3415.90 → 3418.64] Make sure you subscribe by the way to the LTT store newsletter.
[3419.20 → 3419.64] Yeah.
[3419.70 → 3421.00] The old one really was quite,
[3421.04 → 3421.38] uh,
[3421.38 → 3422.04] quite orange.
[3422.26 → 3422.70] Oh,
[3422.78 → 3424.14] this is like the OG,
[3424.40 → 3424.98] OG one.
[3425.12 → 3427.96] And then there was this one and then,
[3428.04 → 3428.30] Oh wait,
[3428.40 → 3429.24] did I call it?
[3429.30 → 3429.42] Oh,
[3429.50 → 3429.70] sorry,
[3429.78 → 3429.94] sorry,
[3430.00 → 3430.14] sorry,
[3430.20 → 3430.34] sorry,
[3430.42 → 3430.54] sorry,
[3430.54 → 3430.72] sorry.
[3431.10 → 3431.88] So yeah,
[3431.96 → 3432.96] re-imagining the WAN hoodie.
[3433.54 → 3437.14] The original launched all the way back in 2016.
[3437.14 → 3442.62] And that was basically just because I had this NVIDIA hoodie that I really liked from G8 brands.
[3442.80 → 3443.38] And I was like,
[3443.42 → 3443.58] okay,
[3443.60 → 3444.36] I just want that.
[3444.44 → 3444.80] But like,
[3444.90 → 3446.22] instead of black and green,
[3446.28 → 3447.22] I just want it orange.
[3447.90 → 3448.34] And,
[3448.48 → 3448.78] uh,
[3449.50 → 3451.66] then we did WAN hoodie V2,
[3452.18 → 3453.90] which was even cooler.
[3454.66 → 3455.14] Then,
[3455.48 → 3456.32] was this V3?
[3457.28 → 3458.80] That doesn't look.
[3459.40 → 3459.84] No,
[3460.02 → 3460.86] that's still V2.
[3460.96 → 3461.38] Right to me.
[3461.54 → 3461.68] Yeah,
[3461.74 → 3462.34] we only ever did.
[3462.38 → 3462.50] Yeah,
[3462.54 → 3462.96] here we go.
[3463.34 → 3465.82] And so this finally is V3,
[3465.82 → 3466.20] man,
[3466.30 → 3467.86] it's a really nice garment.
[3468.02 → 3468.72] So there's the
[3468.72 → 3469.06] uh,
[3469.32 → 3471.78] there's the hexagonal draw cords.
[3472.02 → 3472.62] Here's the
[3472.72 → 3473.66] here's the original poll.
[3474.18 → 3475.32] So we pulled you guys.
[3475.64 → 3482.34] You decided you wanted accurate WAN show colours rather than OG WAN V1 with LTT orange accent.
[3482.76 → 3484.24] And look how good it looks.
[3484.76 → 3485.10] Ah!
[3485.22 → 3485.56] Yeah.
[3485.98 → 3486.88] Is that awesome or what?
[3487.46 → 3487.76] Yeah.
[3487.90 → 3488.20] Okay.
[3489.08 → 3489.60] Uh,
[3489.60 → 3490.68] what was I supposed to be doing?
[3491.40 → 3491.72] Uh.
[3491.82 → 3492.12] Oh yeah,
[3492.16 → 3492.84] let's go gambling.
[3493.00 → 3493.24] Right.
[3493.24 → 3497.90] So there's been some discussion that the promo that we're running right now is gambling.
[3498.12 → 3501.36] The promo that we are running right now is not gambling.
[3501.58 → 3506.86] The promo we're running right now is a sweepstake, and it's a perfectly normal thing for a retailer to do.
[3507.06 → 3507.18] It's,
[3507.18 → 3510.84] it's also not a gambling disguised as sweepstakes.
[3510.96 → 3512.30] It's just actually a sweepstake.
[3513.02 → 3513.36] Um,
[3513.66 → 3516.64] as is required by law,
[3516.78 → 3517.24] uh,
[3517.24 → 3520.94] it is open to people who do not place a purchase.
[3520.94 → 3523.44] Here's all the instructions and everything like that.
[3523.76 → 3524.16] Um,
[3524.20 → 3524.50] but no,
[3524.54 → 3525.20] it's a sweepstake.
[3525.34 → 3527.02] You make an order for the amount.
[3527.16 → 3528.96] You are entered to win a sweepstake.
[3529.14 → 3530.80] And that's a perfectly reasonable thing.
[3530.86 → 3533.54] It's not gambling because what you're doing is you are buying a product.
[3533.94 → 3535.44] And you are going to get the product.
[3535.64 → 3538.28] There is no outcome where you just lose all your money.
[3538.82 → 3540.04] It is not gambling.
[3541.10 → 3542.58] You all need to relax.
[3542.58 → 3544.42] We are,
[3544.42 → 3546.18] we are still anti gambling.
[3547.54 → 3548.06] Uh,
[3548.28 → 3549.14] Magnetics says,
[3549.22 → 3552.18] please make the mandatory sweepstakes skill testing question.
[3552.34 → 3553.38] Answer Louvre.
[3556.12 → 3556.60] Question.
[3556.74 → 3557.52] What is the password?
[3559.00 → 3559.90] I love it.
[3560.04 → 3560.36] Uh,
[3560.38 → 3560.60] okay.
[3560.62 → 3561.96] What was the rest of this merch message?
[3562.36 → 3565.62] Let's go gambling as video content creators.
[3565.62 → 3569.78] How long did it take for you all to get used to your faces being on camera?
[3570.02 → 3573.34] And how did you figure out what to do with your face when you're not talking?
[3574.14 → 3574.54] Oh,
[3574.84 → 3577.74] my understanding is you mouth along with the prompter.
[3578.36 → 3579.18] Thank you for that,
[3579.30 → 3579.36] Dan.
[3579.40 → 3580.00] That's very helpful.
[3580.54 → 3582.56] I'm trying really hard not to do it.
[3583.10 → 3584.22] I couldn't imagine.
[3584.58 → 3586.02] It's difficult.
[3586.70 → 3587.50] Thanks for that.
[3587.76 → 3588.12] Um,
[3588.40 → 3588.68] I just,
[3588.76 → 3589.68] he just has to be,
[3589.72 → 3591.58] he has to be the one talking.
[3591.58 → 3593.18] So even when he can't be the one talking,
[3593.18 → 3595.92] it's in the wrong spot.
[3596.00 → 3596.64] You got to move it back.
[3596.72 → 3597.36] You got to move it back.
[3599.60 → 3601.62] There we go.
[3601.78 → 3602.08] Nice.
[3602.26 → 3602.56] Nice.
[3602.68 → 3602.98] Solid.
[3603.62 → 3604.06] Um,
[3604.48 → 3605.54] man,
[3605.58 → 3607.06] it took me a really long time.
[3607.34 → 3611.34] Like I never really had to edit my own videos.
[3611.66 → 3614.54] So I didn't really get used to that.
[3614.62 → 3618.78] I never watched them because I like filmed them and,
[3618.78 → 3619.62] um,
[3619.62 → 3622.68] I didn't have time to do any kind of QA in the earlier days,
[3622.68 → 3623.68] which sometimes,
[3623.68 → 3624.30] um,
[3624.30 → 3626.94] caused problems as you guys probably well know.
[3627.60 → 3628.04] Um,
[3628.24 → 3628.66] what?
[3629.04 → 3633.74] I think I've only really gotten used to it over the last few years when I've
[3633.74 → 3636.40] watched a lot more of our videos for QA.
[3637.36 → 3637.84] Um,
[3637.92 → 3638.48] beyond that,
[3638.52 → 3638.88] like I,
[3639.00 → 3639.92] and even now,
[3639.92 → 3641.70] like when show in particular,
[3641.70 → 3643.66] when Yvonne puts on when show next to me,
[3643.68 → 3643.94] I'm like,
[3644.10 → 3644.50] bro,
[3644.58 → 3645.34] turn that off.
[3645.96 → 3646.40] Like,
[3646.46 → 3647.04] I can't,
[3647.04 → 3650.22] I can't listen to my voice for an extended period of time like that,
[3650.22 → 3651.98] especially at like two X,
[3652.80 → 3653.30] like,
[3653.64 → 3654.24] Oh man,
[3654.28 → 3655.08] I don't know how she does it.
[3655.10 → 3655.28] I'm like,
[3655.34 → 3656.14] I'm right here.
[3656.20 → 3656.90] If you want to talk to me,
[3656.96 → 3657.94] I'm right here.
[3658.16 → 3658.50] She's like,
[3658.52 → 3658.64] yeah,
[3658.64 → 3661.02] but I'm trying to like to catch up on what you were talking about before.
[3661.02 → 3661.38] I'm like,
[3662.10 → 3663.54] just ask me.
[3663.58 → 3664.00] I'll be,
[3664.52 → 3667.40] I'll happily talk to you rather than listen to me.
[3667.40 → 3668.02] Talk to you,
[3668.16 → 3669.20] please.
[3670.58 → 3671.34] How about you?
[3673.46 → 3673.86] Uh,
[3674.50 → 3674.96] it was,
[3675.02 → 3676.00] it was the core of the question.
[3676.00 → 3676.18] Like,
[3676.22 → 3677.84] what is it like seeing yourself on camera?
[3677.92 → 3678.46] I don't care.
[3678.96 → 3680.24] I don't get juiced up by it.
[3680.30 → 3680.38] I,
[3680.50 → 3681.64] it also doesn't affect me.
[3681.68 → 3683.30] Like I remember when I first started,
[3683.38 → 3684.16] I'm talking like,
[3684.74 → 3685.38] whatever.
[3685.68 → 3686.92] I don't even know what year it was at this point.
[3687.20 → 3687.58] Uh,
[3687.58 → 3689.40] whenever Linus and I first started working together,
[3689.58 → 3693.98] I remember him commenting that like hearing himself is very odd.
[3693.98 → 3696.82] I think I was editing a video and I had it on speakers or something.
[3696.82 → 3697.36] And he was like,
[3697.38 → 3697.64] uh,
[3697.72 → 3698.78] like listen with headphones.
[3699.16 → 3699.52] Like,
[3699.54 → 3700.56] I don't want to hear myself.
[3700.56 → 3700.96] And I was like,
[3701.04 → 3701.36] what?
[3702.06 → 3702.24] Like,
[3702.26 → 3703.16] why do you care?
[3703.16 → 3706.26] Like it never mattered to me at all.
[3706.46 → 3706.86] Um,
[3707.20 → 3707.76] and then I,
[3707.78 → 3710.62] I was actually like somewhat surprised when later on,
[3710.66 → 3713.04] I figured out that that's like a thing for a lot of people.
[3713.04 → 3714.36] And I was the weird one.
[3714.90 → 3715.10] Uh,
[3715.10 → 3715.32] yeah,
[3715.36 → 3716.08] you're the freak.
[3716.36 → 3716.72] Got him.
[3716.96 → 3718.22] I guess it just,
[3718.30 → 3718.46] it,
[3718.46 → 3718.66] it,
[3718.66 → 3720.28] it has never bothered me.
[3720.36 → 3720.58] I,
[3720.70 → 3721.64] it is also like,
[3723.02 → 3723.92] I don't know.
[3724.16 → 3724.66] It's just,
[3724.66 → 3726.34] he just likes the sound of his own voice.
[3726.46 → 3727.86] He just likes the sound of his own voice.
[3727.96 → 3728.32] No,
[3728.34 → 3728.42] no,
[3728.42 → 3729.10] it's in the wrong spot.
[3729.14 → 3731.02] It just also doesn't bother me.
[3731.02 → 3731.20] he's,
[3731.20 → 3733.14] he's still ready for it.
[3733.40 → 3734.48] I saw you read George.
[3736.62 → 3736.98] Nice.
[3737.94 → 3738.90] I'm just going to leave that.
[3739.88 → 3740.94] We should get one for Dan.
[3741.04 → 3741.54] Nice assist.
[3742.96 → 3745.90] Cause that was a nice assist.
[3748.04 → 3748.48] Dopamine.
[3754.32 → 3754.72] Um,
[3755.60 → 3756.48] all right.
[3756.66 → 3758.38] What are we supposed to be doing right now?
[3758.54 → 3758.78] Uh,
[3758.78 → 3759.42] more topics.
[3759.54 → 3759.68] Yeah.
[3759.68 → 3760.48] Let's do some more topics.
[3760.58 → 3761.32] What do you want to talk?
[3761.38 → 3762.22] What do you want to talk about Luke?
[3762.22 → 3763.94] What do we get going on over here?
[3763.94 → 3764.30] I don't know.
[3764.38 → 3765.38] It was a heck of a week for YouTube.
[3765.66 → 3766.32] We could talk about that.
[3766.34 → 3766.72] let's do that.
[3767.28 → 3774.22] YouTube appeared to be ramping up its focus on paid memberships this week after several users on the LTT Subreddit reported that they,
[3774.42 → 3775.48] when they clicked on a video,
[3775.66 → 3781.32] they were met with pop-up ads for the feature that had to be closed before playback could begin.
[3781.32 → 3783.60] And that's very annoying.
[3783.60 → 3787.78] Especially because we disabled it at significant cost to us.
[3787.86 → 3788.20] Oh,
[3788.28 → 3789.08] this is interesting.
[3789.28 → 3789.92] I'm so sorry.
[3790.02 → 3790.98] I'm about to derail us.
[3791.06 → 3791.44] Look at that.
[3791.56 → 3791.72] Cool.
[3791.94 → 3793.00] I'm so surprised.
[3793.00 → 3794.44] I was,
[3794.44 → 3795.36] I was,
[3795.56 → 3797.50] I didn't think it would be a ton,
[3798.16 → 3800.06] but I didn't think it would be zero.
[3800.82 → 3807.94] Disabling YouTube memberships caused literally zero of our old members to migrate over to float plane.
[3808.80 → 3809.50] And we,
[3809.56 → 3811.28] we had a theory back when we,
[3811.28 → 3811.86] we had a pretty strong theory.
[3812.02 → 3814.58] Back when we enabled YouTube memberships in the first place,
[3814.58 → 3819.04] it was our strong belief that it would probably be mostly incremental.
[3819.30 → 3822.64] The people that were going to subscribe on float plane were,
[3822.64 → 3823.88] we're going to do that.
[3823.94 → 3830.76] And the people that were going to do it on YouTube were only interested in using a payment method they already have with a platform they already use.
[3831.50 → 3833.22] And I was,
[3833.38 → 3836.48] I wasn't surprised that,
[3836.58 → 3836.70] you know,
[3836.70 → 3839.98] we didn't just migrate everybody over from YouTube memberships to float plane.
[3840.32 → 3844.18] I was surprised that it appears to have been literally zero.
[3844.54 → 3845.18] So yeah,
[3845.18 → 3845.66] that was,
[3845.78 → 3847.44] that was a downer.
[3847.70 → 3852.68] It had been communicated for a long time that like the better experience was on float plane.
[3852.68 → 3853.18] Like the
[3853.18 → 3853.44] the
[3853.44 → 3856.34] the advertising was pretty in your face about that.
[3856.42 → 3861.50] So I think most people that would have moved over had moved over.
[3862.84 → 3863.28] Yeah.
[3863.38 → 3863.56] I mean,
[3863.58 → 3863.76] I had,
[3863.82 → 3864.66] I had a conversation with,
[3864.90 → 3866.10] with some creators today.
[3866.10 → 3867.58] talking about,
[3867.58 → 3870.24] they were asking of like,
[3870.24 → 3872.10] if we had an external platform,
[3872.10 → 3874.04] should we turn on YouTube monetization?
[3874.04 → 3874.88] And I,
[3874.88 → 3878.34] I lamented about how annoying it is having the YouTube,
[3878.82 → 3879.98] not YouTube monetization,
[3880.10 → 3880.24] sorry,
[3880.36 → 3881.02] YouTube memberships.
[3881.14 → 3881.30] Yeah.
[3881.42 → 3885.42] I lamented about how annoying it was to have the memberships thing shoved in your face all the time.
[3885.42 → 3885.88] But I was like,
[3885.90 → 3887.22] if you don't care about that,
[3887.22 → 3888.62] then theoretically,
[3888.90 → 3889.36] yes.
[3889.36 → 3895.68] because there is a relatively large amount of people that just will not leave the primary platform,
[3895.76 → 3900.98] whether that primary platform is YouTube or Twitch or kick or whatever their thing is that they're watching content on.
[3901.10 → 3903.46] There will be nothing that will get them off of that platform.
[3903.46 → 3911.18] Most people that use the internet use like a very small amount of websites and do not go out of that circle.
[3912.12 → 3912.22] Yeah.
[3912.22 → 3913.40] You've talked about that before.
[3913.52 → 3914.52] It's kind of wild,
[3914.66 → 3915.84] but it's so true.
[3916.20 → 3916.68] Yeah.
[3916.68 → 3917.38] Like I,
[3917.62 → 3918.26] I mean,
[3918.32 → 3919.14] not going to lie.
[3919.60 → 3919.94] My,
[3920.12 → 3923.22] my Safari right now has,
[3923.36 → 3924.32] let's see,
[3925.26 → 3926.36] five tabs.
[3927.18 → 3931.74] And those five tabs are probably most of what I look at on a
[3931.80 → 3932.74] on a typical day.
[3933.46 → 3934.02] Yep.
[3935.08 → 3936.28] Got LTT store,
[3936.58 → 3937.40] LTT forum,
[3937.68 → 3938.72] LTT Subreddit,
[3939.46 → 3940.84] LTT store analytics.
[3944.04 → 3945.46] And I'm tracking gold pricing.
[3946.68 → 3948.60] And even,
[3948.76 → 3950.16] and normally it would be down to four.
[3951.96 → 3955.16] Are you doing the tracking of gold pricing on,
[3955.16 → 3956.38] um,
[3956.54 → 3958.08] like a Google thing?
[3958.28 → 3958.52] Nope.
[3959.00 → 3959.62] Gold price.org.
[3960.24 → 3960.64] Okay.
[3961.10 → 3961.40] Yep.
[3963.20 → 3963.68] Um,
[3964.30 → 3964.86] hold on.
[3964.90 → 3965.08] Where,
[3965.22 → 3965.84] where were we at?
[3965.92 → 3966.26] Oh yeah.
[3966.26 → 3966.54] Right.
[3966.64 → 3967.32] So yeah.
[3967.50 → 3968.32] So that,
[3968.48 → 3969.88] and so for me,
[3969.88 → 3976.54] it was just a little bit frustrating to have people upset at us again about this,
[3976.54 → 3977.54] memberships thing.
[3977.70 → 3984.74] When we actually took a very measurable financial hit to have YouTube stop harassing our viewers
[3984.74 → 3985.96] about memberships.
[3985.96 → 3989.92] So for them to have a bug that went and like,
[3990.42 → 3993.46] like put LTT memberships in people's faces again,
[3993.46 → 3997.56] when we already had turned them off, and it wasn't even an option to subscribe to them,
[3998.18 → 3999.28] really sucked.
[3999.38 → 3999.78] It was like,
[3999.78 → 4003.66] it was the insult to injury that I was not into,
[4003.66 → 4006.14] not into.
[4006.72 → 4007.82] It's kind of funny.
[4009.98 → 4010.38] Yeah.
[4010.54 → 4010.86] I mean,
[4010.86 → 4011.82] it's a little bit funny.
[4012.06 → 4012.78] Maybe do you,
[4013.06 → 4013.52] we have,
[4013.74 → 4015.04] it's a little funny.
[4015.20 → 4016.90] We had thousands of YouTube members.
[4016.90 → 4019.42] It was like tens of thousands of dollars of revenue a year.
[4019.48 → 4019.74] Luke.
[4020.70 → 4021.24] I don't,
[4021.30 → 4022.58] I don't think that part's funny.
[4022.74 → 4023.48] I just think.
[4023.48 → 4023.72] Right.
[4023.78 → 4025.06] Well then tell me the funny part,
[4025.18 → 4025.38] Luke.
[4025.88 → 4029.26] I think it's funny that you turned it off, and then it got shoved in your face.
[4029.26 → 4029.58] Anyway.
[4029.66 → 4030.46] I think that's funny.
[4030.62 → 4032.28] I can appreciate the irony,
[4032.64 → 4035.50] but that doesn't mean I have to agree that it's funny.
[4036.14 → 4039.04] I can appreciate an unpleasant irony.
[4040.10 → 4040.50] Yeah.
[4040.60 → 4040.80] Yeah.
[4040.80 → 4041.04] Yeah.
[4041.12 → 4042.48] Maybe I'll laugh about it soon.
[4042.58 → 4043.46] Maybe I'll laugh about it.
[4043.46 → 4047.86] Once YouTube fixes the memberships feature and makes it so I can control the promotion and
[4047.86 → 4050.22] we can turn it back on, and we can build it back up.
[4050.28 → 4051.80] Maybe then I'll think it's funny.
[4052.34 → 4053.24] Do you think that's coming?
[4053.78 → 4054.42] I don't know.
[4054.80 → 4055.74] I look,
[4055.80 → 4058.26] if I thought that it was coming on it,
[4058.34 → 4059.52] on the near horizon,
[4060.18 → 4061.84] I wouldn't have turned it off.
[4062.32 → 4063.06] Mm-hmm.
[4063.10 → 4065.08] It's convincing people to resubscribe.
[4065.08 → 4065.88] We'll take time.
[4065.94 → 4066.34] Oh dude,
[4066.40 → 4067.54] it'll take fricking forever.
[4068.08 → 4068.76] Like that.
[4069.72 → 4070.38] That's just,
[4070.46 → 4070.58] yeah,
[4070.58 → 4073.76] that's just like gone forever now.
[4073.82 → 4075.52] So very frustrating.
[4076.42 → 4076.82] Um,
[4076.82 → 4078.82] yeah,
[4079.04 → 4080.06] I'm area agreed.
[4080.22 → 4080.94] It would be super.
[4080.94 → 4083.38] How many other people turned it off?
[4083.66 → 4085.90] I know of like one other creator.
[4085.90 → 4086.48] Like it was,
[4086.60 → 4088.78] was it just us and them and that's it?
[4088.82 → 4088.96] Yeah,
[4088.96 → 4089.48] I think so.
[4090.56 → 4091.70] Cause at a certain point,
[4091.70 → 4091.92] like,
[4091.94 → 4092.78] are we even helping?
[4094.34 → 4095.10] I don't know,
[4095.14 → 4095.28] Luke.
[4095.36 → 4098.04] Sometimes it's not a matter of helping or not helping.
[4098.04 → 4099.96] I think it's just principles.
[4100.12 → 4100.48] Well,
[4100.60 → 4102.62] I don't even think I'm not even going to,
[4102.70 → 4102.90] I'm not,
[4102.98 → 4103.10] no,
[4103.14 → 4105.86] I'm not even going to say that this is like a principled stand or anything.
[4105.86 → 4107.54] What it is it's just simple.
[4108.08 → 4110.22] Our audience really didn't like it.
[4111.06 → 4112.46] And at the end of the day,
[4112.70 → 4113.26] I mean,
[4113.34 → 4114.58] you've been there in the
[4114.70 → 4117.86] in the recent meetings that we've had sort of talking about our,
[4117.86 → 4119.32] our company core values,
[4119.40 → 4119.64] right?
[4119.64 → 4123.62] And one of our core values is the audience is our guide.
[4124.24 → 4125.48] And so how do we,
[4125.62 → 4127.64] how do we live our core values?
[4127.74 → 4131.58] How do we say with a straight face that we live our core values?
[4131.92 → 4135.88] If we take a bunch of feedback that is showing up in our inboxes,
[4135.90 → 4136.98] it's showing up on the forum,
[4136.98 → 4138.40] it's showing up on the Subreddit,
[4138.48 → 4141.06] it's showing up in the YouTube comments that people are saying,
[4141.16 → 4141.20] Hey,
[4141.20 → 4144.66] I really don't like the way this membership's feature is getting crammed down my
[4144.66 → 4144.94] throat.
[4144.94 → 4147.64] So how do we say that the audience is our guide?
[4147.74 → 4149.48] If we ignore feedback like that,
[4149.52 → 4149.94] we can't.
[4152.86 → 4153.30] Yeah.
[4153.30 → 4155.82] And that ties into like a
[4155.82 → 4157.14] kind of ties into one of our,
[4157.24 → 4157.98] one of our other ones.
[4158.08 → 4160.24] Listen before you lead is another one.
[4160.34 → 4161.18] I don't know if that's,
[4161.24 → 4163.58] I don't know if that's entirely fair all the time though,
[4163.58 → 4169.14] because if you blindly listen to the audience at every single point,
[4169.20 → 4170.42] regardless of cost,
[4170.42 → 4172.88] then you wouldn't have ads on anything.
[4172.94 → 4175.28] But that's why it's because they love those.
[4175.34 → 4176.32] That's why it's guide.
[4176.52 → 4177.08] But yeah,
[4177.10 → 4178.44] but that's what I'm saying is like it was,
[4178.52 → 4179.60] with some users complaining,
[4179.60 → 4182.00] that doesn't mean that you just have to do it.
[4182.00 → 4182.56] Well,
[4182.86 → 4184.40] but it wasn't just some users.
[4184.74 → 4185.72] It was a lot.
[4185.96 → 4186.22] And,
[4186.30 → 4187.56] and I agreed that's,
[4187.60 → 4187.78] that's,
[4187.86 → 4188.68] that's a huge thing,
[4188.70 → 4188.88] right?
[4188.94 → 4189.50] There you go.
[4189.60 → 4189.86] You have to,
[4190.00 → 4191.18] you have to apply a filter.
[4191.68 → 4192.34] I agree.
[4192.42 → 4192.86] It's annoying.
[4193.42 → 4194.04] And we had people.
[4194.28 → 4194.86] I'm not,
[4194.96 → 4196.58] I'm not talking about this specific case.
[4196.58 → 4197.14] I'm not saying like,
[4197.18 → 4198.02] we should turn it back on.
[4198.04 → 4198.54] I'm just saying,
[4198.72 → 4200.58] I'm speaking generally.
[4200.92 → 4203.44] We have to try to put ourselves sparked by this.
[4203.54 → 4207.04] We've got to try to put ourselves in the position of a viewer and kind of go,
[4207.14 → 4207.26] okay.
[4207.26 → 4207.50] Yeah.
[4207.50 → 4207.70] Like,
[4207.70 → 4209.38] do I have any intention of subscribing to this?
[4209.44 → 4209.62] Okay.
[4209.62 → 4211.26] Then why is it cluttering up my interface?
[4211.26 → 4212.82] It was really annoying for me.
[4212.90 → 4213.64] I know like I,
[4213.64 → 4216.02] I'm a premium subscriber to YouTube.
[4216.44 → 4216.88] LTT,
[4217.30 → 4217.82] funny enough,
[4218.06 → 4220.28] gets a decent amount of money from me,
[4220.28 → 4221.26] um,
[4221.34 → 4222.34] from my premium.
[4222.68 → 4223.16] I,
[4223.32 → 4223.46] it,
[4223.46 → 4224.56] it was everywhere.
[4224.56 → 4225.06] It was,
[4225.14 → 4226.52] it was honestly very annoying.
[4226.90 → 4227.34] Um,
[4227.78 → 4229.54] at the very least,
[4229.54 → 4231.16] like let premium people be like,
[4231.22 → 4231.32] yo,
[4231.34 → 4232.20] I don't want to see this.
[4232.38 → 4232.68] Yeah.
[4232.68 → 4232.84] Um,
[4233.00 → 4233.16] well,
[4233.18 → 4234.24] and that was part of the feedback.
[4234.24 → 4236.40] Literally ads all over my screen.
[4236.40 → 4239.96] When I pay to not see ads all over my screen.
[4239.96 → 4243.38] And that was part of the feedback I gave to YouTube as well as I don't think premium,
[4243.38 → 4246.48] I don't think premium members or not members,
[4246.58 → 4247.00] excuse me,
[4247.34 → 4249.26] premium subscribers should be seeing this.
[4249.32 → 4249.72] I don't,
[4249.98 → 4250.12] yeah,
[4250.12 → 4251.68] I don't think it's necessary.
[4251.68 → 4252.04] And,
[4252.14 → 4254.40] and at the very least,
[4254.72 → 4257.84] give me the creator control over that.
[4257.84 → 4261.86] Like if I want to spam people who have premium by telling them about,
[4261.96 → 4262.10] you know,
[4262.16 → 4263.28] YouTube memberships or whatever,
[4263.40 → 4264.14] then that's,
[4264.24 → 4264.38] that,
[4264.52 → 4264.92] that's,
[4265.08 → 4266.84] that's on me at that point.
[4266.84 → 4268.60] Then if I alienate the audience,
[4268.60 → 4270.88] but don't do that on my behalf,
[4270.88 → 4278.66] then I have no control over you harassing the audience to buy something on my behalf.
[4278.74 → 4279.54] I don't like that.
[4280.42 → 4280.50] Yeah.
[4280.52 → 4280.78] So,
[4281.66 → 4282.20] so I mean,
[4282.26 → 4283.04] and we,
[4283.12 → 4285.30] we had an earlier version of our,
[4285.44 → 4285.96] of our,
[4286.08 → 4286.44] of our,
[4286.52 → 4287.76] what are they called again?
[4287.82 → 4288.12] Core,
[4288.80 → 4289.48] core pillars,
[4289.66 → 4289.90] core,
[4290.90 → 4291.34] the
[4291.34 → 4291.52] the
[4291.52 → 4291.96] the thing,
[4292.18 → 4292.48] the fat.
[4293.16 → 4293.72] Core values.
[4293.86 → 4294.24] Core values.
[4294.32 → 4294.60] Thank you.
[4294.66 → 4295.00] Thank you.
[4295.28 → 4299.06] We had an earlier version of our core values that was the audience is the boss.
[4299.66 → 4304.00] And we got some pushback internally when we did like focus groups and stuff.
[4304.72 → 4305.82] And that was my,
[4305.90 → 4307.98] that was my wording was the audience is the boss.
[4308.10 → 4308.64] And I think,
[4308.64 → 4319.44] I think where we got a bit of a disconnect internally between some people and sort of my interpretation of that is I always took my boss's instructions as sort of guidelines.
[4319.44 → 4320.10] I,
[4320.16 → 4320.56] I was,
[4320.56 → 4326.62] I was not a very good employee in the sense that I just did exactly what I was told and followed orders.
[4326.62 → 4328.80] Like I always kind of,
[4329.24 → 4329.48] I've,
[4329.48 → 4331.90] I've talked about the story of how we,
[4332.02 → 4332.18] you know,
[4332.24 → 4332.48] LT,
[4332.66 → 4335.46] our NCI tech tips started in the first place.
[4335.46 → 4338.10] It was only when he asked me the second or third time.
[4338.18 → 4339.82] I can't remember exactly how many times it was,
[4339.84 → 4341.68] but the first time he asked me to start a YouTube channel,
[4341.68 → 4346.20] I ignored him because a lot of the time he would give me waste of time,
[4346.26 → 4347.76] busy work that wasn't necessary.
[4347.76 → 4351.98] And if I just didn't do it and I did stuff that added more value to the company,
[4351.98 → 4354.42] then I'd get promotions faster, and I'd get paid more.
[4354.58 → 4356.56] So I would just ignore stupid assignments.
[4356.72 → 4361.16] So it wasn't until he gave me this stupid assignment multiple times that I kind of went,
[4361.24 → 4361.40] okay,
[4361.48 → 4361.72] fine,
[4361.74 → 4362.30] I'll do it.
[4362.76 → 4363.20] Um,
[4363.20 → 4364.56] but that was always my approach.
[4364.80 → 4365.92] So to me,
[4366.04 → 4374.12] audience is the boss meant that it gives me instructions and that I rely upon it for the gainful employment that I enjoy.
[4374.54 → 4378.34] But just because it tells me something doesn't mean that I absolutely do that.
[4378.38 → 4380.92] It means I have to apply a common sense filter,
[4380.92 → 4386.24] but I've always been a little stubborn,
[4386.88 → 4387.40] bullheaded,
[4387.94 → 4388.36] uh,
[4388.40 → 4388.70] whatever.
[4388.84 → 4389.02] Let's,
[4389.12 → 4391.26] let's not get into the words to describe Linus right now.
[4391.34 → 4392.12] It's not necessary.
[4392.12 → 4393.58] Um,
[4394.50 → 4395.04] sure.
[4395.20 → 4402.88] And I can see how that word could be really intimidating or could,
[4402.98 → 4406.14] could put other people in an uncomfortable place,
[4406.14 → 4409.48] especially when the audience is this nebulous,
[4410.06 → 4415.12] multi faceted entity that out of one side of its mouth,
[4415.18 → 4415.32] right?
[4415.34 → 4417.74] Because it's made up of many people can be telling you,
[4417.82 → 4419.40] this is the greatest video I've ever seen.
[4419.40 → 4420.12] And then other,
[4420.18 → 4422.26] the other side of its mouth at the exact same time,
[4422.30 → 4422.92] you'll have two comments,
[4423.00 → 4423.74] one after the other.
[4423.90 → 4425.44] This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
[4425.66 → 4426.72] This is trash.
[4426.88 → 4428.08] You should probably retire.
[4428.52 → 4428.92] Right.
[4429.00 → 4429.92] How do you deal with that?
[4430.06 → 4431.06] I can't believe new,
[4431.06 → 4433.20] new LTT is like this.
[4433.28 → 4434.64] They've lost the old ways.
[4434.64 → 4436.68] And then another comment saying,
[4437.00 → 4438.74] I've been waiting so long for an old,
[4438.74 → 4439.86] uh,
[4440.26 → 4441.30] video like this.
[4441.46 → 4441.64] Yeah.
[4442.92 → 4443.52] And like,
[4443.60 → 4447.02] and I think a great example of this is stuff like the Craigslist,
[4447.16 → 4447.70] um,
[4447.78 → 4448.34] video wall,
[4448.40 → 4448.92] right?
[4448.92 → 4449.92] or that,
[4449.92 → 4451.86] that $30,000 cooler that,
[4451.86 → 4452.14] uh,
[4452.14 → 4453.00] Charles Fugger,
[4453.10 → 4453.76] uh,
[4453.76 → 4454.42] brought up here.
[4454.54 → 4457.38] It's like right back to back.
[4457.58 → 4458.10] You'll have,
[4458.14 → 4459.10] it's very polarizing,
[4459.10 → 4459.32] right?
[4459.32 → 4460.20] You'll have people saying like,
[4460.26 → 4461.56] this is classic LTT.
[4461.76 → 4462.20] I love it.
[4462.24 → 4466.12] They're goofing around with like cool stuff that nobody else would get a chance to get their
[4466.12 → 4466.58] hands on.
[4466.62 → 4468.44] And we can enjoy it vicariously through them.
[4468.44 → 4469.78] And then the next one will be,
[4470.24 → 4470.38] Oh,
[4470.44 → 4470.70] look,
[4470.76 → 4473.82] it's millionaire line is showing off his rich kid toys again.
[4474.22 → 4474.42] I,
[4474.60 → 4476.58] where's the more down to earth content.
[4476.70 → 4477.50] And it's like,
[4477.50 → 4478.88] how do I,
[4478.98 → 4480.82] how do I build a content plan around that?
[4480.82 → 4480.98] Right.
[4481.02 → 4486.38] And so I can understand why internally people were looking at it going like,
[4486.44 → 4486.62] okay,
[4486.62 → 4488.58] boss feels like a really strong word.
[4488.86 → 4490.88] And I wouldn't want a boss like that.
[4492.16 → 4494.44] So after much deliberation,
[4495.28 → 4496.40] we settled on guide,
[4496.60 → 4497.10] you know,
[4497.10 → 4498.00] more like a lighthouse.
[4498.44 → 4499.02] It's,
[4499.12 → 4502.46] it's a point that we can use for navigation,
[4502.46 → 4505.04] but if we go right toward it,
[4505.08 → 4506.44] we're going to end up in the rocks.
[4506.70 → 4507.38] You know what I mean?
[4510.60 → 4512.72] Enigma blade says I'm a lighthouse.
[4513.28 → 4513.92] Thank you.
[4514.00 → 4515.84] Enigma blade in flow plane chat.
[4516.16 → 4517.00] Appreciate you.
[4522.00 → 4523.88] What are we supposed to be talking about right now?
[4524.04 → 4524.46] Oh yeah.
[4524.54 → 4524.76] Right.
[4524.84 → 4526.00] You were in the middle of,
[4526.12 → 4528.40] it's been a heck of a week for YouTube and I totally went off.
[4528.44 → 4530.12] On a long side quest.
[4530.82 → 4531.14] Yeah.
[4531.36 → 4533.22] I have no idea how far I got into it.
[4533.36 → 4533.76] Um,
[4533.76 → 4534.36] I think one line.
[4535.40 → 4535.84] Probably.
[4536.28 → 4536.48] Cool.
[4536.48 → 4537.48] I'm just going to redo it.
[4537.48 → 4539.46] Because I think that was genuinely like 20 minutes.
[4539.62 → 4539.94] Uh,
[4540.00 → 4541.58] YouTube appeared to be ramping up.
[4541.58 → 4542.58] It's focused on paid memberships.
[4542.58 → 4543.52] It's focused on paid memberships this week.
[4543.52 → 4547.64] After several users on the LTT Subreddit reported that when they clicked a video,
[4547.64 → 4553.20] they were met with pop-up ads for the feature that had to be closed before playback could begin,
[4553.28 → 4555.32] which is like obviously incredibly annoying.
[4555.70 → 4556.02] Um,
[4556.02 → 4559.22] LTT writers reached out to YouTube, and they told us it was a bug,
[4559.90 → 4560.22] which,
[4560.44 → 4560.72] okay,
[4561.06 → 4562.86] doesn't seem way too bad then I guess.
[4563.10 → 4563.88] An annoying bug,
[4563.94 → 4564.94] but hopefully that doesn't keep going.
[4564.94 → 4565.38] Uh,
[4565.46 → 4573.86] YouTuber Underman had his entire channel terminated after the platform mistakenly connected him to a different channel that had received three copyright strikes.
[4573.86 → 4578.60] Underman appealed the account termination, and it was obvious that no human had actually reviewed it,
[4578.90 → 4579.34] uh,
[4579.34 → 4581.24] which led to him tweeting about it,
[4581.78 → 4585.74] garnering attention and eventually getting the decision reversed.
[4586.80 → 4587.40] Ugh.
[4587.82 → 4591.38] YouTube took down multiple videos by YouTuber CyberCPU,
[4591.60 → 4592.76] CyberCPU tech,
[4592.94 → 4593.14] sorry,
[4593.46 → 4593.82] uh,
[4593.82 → 4596.78] that worked around Windows 11's installation restrictions.
[4597.14 → 4597.44] Initially,
[4597.54 → 4598.94] YouTube rejected his appeal,
[4599.30 → 4603.60] claiming his content was in violation of its harmful or dangerous content policy.
[4603.86 → 4605.58] Since garnering a bunch of attention,
[4605.90 → 4612.78] CyberCPU tech has had his videos restored and YouTube denies that the removal had anything to do with automation.
[4613.86 → 4614.06] Hmm.
[4614.18 → 4614.58] Okay.
[4614.70 → 4619.04] So then did they explain why a human moderator removed it?
[4619.52 → 4620.34] Probably not.
[4621.72 → 4622.60] Discussion question.
[4622.92 → 4626.06] In an environment where AI is increasingly being used to moderate content,
[4626.30 → 4629.26] how do you think LMG's videos may need to change?
[4629.68 → 4630.00] Well,
[4630.08 → 4631.30] I can tell you already,
[4631.30 → 4635.24] I don't go full Armageddon when I'm playing cyberpunk on camera.
[4636.56 → 4637.04] Yeah.
[4637.14 → 4638.40] But that's more around their policies.
[4638.40 → 4638.86] Do you want to talk about that?
[4638.92 → 4639.90] We talked about it last week.
[4640.96 → 4641.44] Okay.
[4641.62 → 4642.70] I wasn't sure if that was on the show right now.
[4642.70 → 4642.82] Yeah.
[4642.90 → 4645.14] Mass violence against civilians is,
[4645.14 → 4645.52] uh,
[4645.52 → 4647.52] no longer kosher in video games,
[4647.70 → 4648.18] um,
[4648.20 → 4649.06] for YouTube uploads.
[4649.62 → 4650.60] So we're just,
[4650.72 → 4651.40] so I'm just gonna,
[4651.64 → 4654.30] I'm just going to walk around pacifist style
[4654.30 → 4655.50] and,
[4655.50 → 4656.34] um,
[4656.34 → 4660.08] only pull a gun on the cops if they pull a gun on me.
[4660.24 → 4660.38] That,
[4660.54 → 4661.06] that's my line.
[4661.40 → 4662.14] That's my line.
[4662.66 → 4663.34] In cyberpunk.
[4663.70 → 4664.44] In cyberpunk.
[4666.82 → 4667.26] Um,
[4667.60 → 4668.94] this is really annoying.
[4668.94 → 4669.40] In Minecraft.
[4670.70 → 4671.14] Okay.
[4671.66 → 4672.10] We,
[4672.74 → 4673.34] often,
[4673.88 → 4675.08] very often,
[4675.08 → 4679.78] Luke and I will kind of go off on like Microsoft Teams being kind of a steaming pile of shit.
[4680.02 → 4680.38] Oh yeah.
[4680.48 → 4685.26] And we will get people just baffled and confused in the comments.
[4685.26 → 4685.66] Like,
[4685.74 → 4688.60] how could you ever say anything negative about my weird purple baby?
[4689.24 → 4692.92] And this is the kind of thing that I'm talking about.
[4692.98 → 4693.24] Okay.
[4693.64 → 4695.64] So let's get on the
[4695.72 → 4696.32] on the thing.
[4696.42 → 4699.12] The bug where you schedule a message, and it shows up as sent.
[4699.26 → 4699.74] Don't worry.
[4699.74 → 4701.22] I'm coming to schedule messages.
[4701.40 → 4701.84] Okay.
[4701.84 → 4704.00] So on my teams right now,
[4704.00 → 4706.56] I have the one and only Sarah,
[4706.64 → 4707.68] but okay.
[4708.14 → 4710.06] I wanted to send her a message.
[4710.22 → 4711.06] Hold on.
[4711.30 → 4711.50] Eh.
[4712.58 → 4714.34] I wanted to send her a message.
[4714.96 → 4715.44] Um,
[4715.44 → 4718.58] that says lighthouse pin for audiences,
[4718.74 → 4719.20] our guide.
[4719.46 → 4721.60] I really don't know how well this is going to work.
[4722.30 → 4722.74] Um,
[4723.66 → 4723.82] yeah,
[4723.84 → 4724.54] that's not whatever.
[4724.62 → 4726.46] The point is I wanted to send her a message.
[4726.58 → 4727.58] Lighthouse pin audiences,
[4727.70 → 4728.06] our guide.
[4728.26 → 4729.90] I'm right-clicking on send,
[4729.98 → 4730.66] right?
[4730.66 → 4733.14] Because I would like to schedule the message because it's,
[4733.28 → 4733.38] you know,
[4733.38 → 4734.42] pretty late on a Friday.
[4734.42 → 4737.10] I don't think she's in the office right now and says,
[4737.22 → 4739.42] you'll be able to schedule messages.
[4740.16 → 4740.60] Uh,
[4740.68 → 4740.96] yes.
[4740.98 → 4742.54] I've talked about this on my show before.
[4742.70 → 4744.42] After you send your first message.
[4745.00 → 4746.58] That's what this error says.
[4747.12 → 4750.98] You can clearly see last week when I sent her,
[4751.38 → 4751.54] sir,
[4751.62 → 4751.94] ability,
[4752.10 → 4753.30] or I asked for ability.
[4753.48 → 4753.78] Oh no.
[4753.78 → 4754.72] Because I emailed her,
[4754.82 → 4754.96] sir,
[4755.02 → 4755.94] ability to can,
[4756.10 → 4758.12] and she teams to me back,
[4758.20 → 4758.84] sir,
[4758.94 → 4760.80] ability to can with his top hat.
[4760.80 → 4761.74] And I was like,
[4761.90 → 4762.26] OMG,
[4762.58 → 4763.48] chat loves it.
[4764.76 → 4767.16] We have clearly corresponded before.
[4769.26 → 4770.56] So in conclusion,
[4771.52 → 4772.00] steams.
[4773.00 → 4773.54] I steam.
[4773.68 → 4774.04] Teams.
[4774.50 → 4774.86] Actually,
[4774.90 → 4775.44] I like that.
[4775.78 → 4776.06] Can we,
[4776.14 → 4778.44] can we switch to just calling it steams?
[4778.64 → 4779.38] In conclusion,
[4779.76 → 4780.28] steams.
[4780.40 → 4781.80] I think it's too close to steam.
[4782.06 → 4783.18] So people won't like it.
[4783.32 → 4784.18] Oh man.
[4785.40 → 4785.88] Irritating.
[4787.08 → 4787.68] Irritating.
[4789.22 → 4790.40] Steaming pile.
[4791.06 → 4791.46] Uh,
[4791.60 → 4792.00] so yeah.
[4792.20 → 4793.32] So now Luke,
[4793.58 → 4795.16] I'm going to send an email.
[4797.60 → 4803.80] And that will only make sense to the people who watched the pre-show.
[4804.32 → 4805.42] I don't like that.
[4805.70 → 4807.66] And I'm right to do it.
[4808.34 → 4809.30] In this case you are,
[4809.30 → 4810.24] but it's so annoying.
[4810.48 → 4810.94] It's like,
[4811.22 → 4811.42] okay,
[4811.46 → 4811.96] so that,
[4812.28 → 4818.36] it's funny that that bug exists because that shouldn't be a thing in the first place.
[4818.80 → 4824.36] You should absolutely be able to schedule messages to people in your own freaking org.
[4824.38 → 4824.74] In your org.
[4824.74 → 4826.56] Even if you haven't sent them a message before.
[4826.74 → 4828.72] We're talking within the same org.
[4829.64 → 4830.04] That's,
[4830.04 → 4831.04] that's so crazy,
[4831.84 → 4832.08] man.
[4832.14 → 4832.40] Like,
[4832.42 → 4833.34] it's so stupid.
[4833.88 → 4834.16] Um,
[4834.16 → 4834.66] so I have,
[4834.74 → 4838.86] I have literally sent emails before screenshotting that error.
[4839.30 → 4839.86] And being like,
[4840.16 → 4840.84] this is stupid,
[4840.98 → 4842.32] but I wanted to schedule this message.
[4842.46 → 4843.44] So here's the message.
[4843.76 → 4845.18] Don't respond to this email.
[4845.38 → 4846.78] I never want to see this email again.
[4846.92 → 4847.68] Respond on teams,
[4847.78 → 4848.04] please.
[4850.36 → 4850.98] It's like,
[4851.10 → 4852.28] but come on.
[4852.28 → 4854.58] It's so annoying.
[4856.46 → 4856.82] Oh,
[4856.82 → 4857.26] man.
[4860.12 → 4860.48] Oh,
[4860.66 → 4861.12] Lord.
[4861.22 → 4861.54] All right.
[4861.72 → 4862.54] What are we supposed to be doing,
[4862.62 → 4862.74] Dan?
[4862.96 → 4863.42] I can also,
[4863.52 → 4863.80] I will,
[4863.88 → 4865.98] I will also confirm in the past.
[4866.02 → 4866.58] I think,
[4867.26 → 4870.40] I think I said that people from Google told me that they use,
[4870.40 → 4871.80] uh,
[4871.92 → 4873.30] whatever it's even called.
[4873.36 → 4873.94] I don't know.
[4873.94 → 4874.94] Uh,
[4876.04 → 4877.44] whatever their chat is.
[4878.70 → 4879.14] Hangouts.
[4879.80 → 4880.66] I'm not sure.
[4880.86 → 4881.50] Gmail chat.
[4881.68 → 4881.94] I don't,
[4881.94 → 4882.20] I don't know.
[4882.26 → 4883.28] It's called chat.
[4883.28 → 4884.58] It's called chat.
[4884.78 → 4884.92] Sure.
[4885.08 → 4885.44] Whatever.
[4885.78 → 4886.18] Um,
[4886.18 → 4886.38] I,
[4886.44 → 4890.72] I've been told that they use that, and I just didn't believe it because like,
[4890.72 → 4897.76] I know people at Microsoft that complain about teams and like kind of use Slack on the side anyway.
[4897.96 → 4898.16] Yeah.
[4898.16 → 4898.76] Um,
[4899.06 → 4904.44] and I can confirm that at least everyone that I saw,
[4904.54 → 4910.44] which was multiple people were using meat or chat or whatever the heck it's called.
[4910.80 → 4911.92] They were using it.
[4912.24 → 4912.54] So,
[4912.54 → 4914.80] all right.
[4915.24 → 4916.28] As of right now,
[4916.34 → 4918.16] sounds like they're actually doing it,
[4918.28 → 4922.96] which is interesting to me because it sure felt like they were abandoning it really not that long ago,
[4923.10 → 4926.30] but it is what it is.
[4928.16 → 4928.66] Um,
[4928.66 → 4932.02] depends on teams.
[4932.10 → 4933.06] GitHub is still on Slack.
[4933.20 → 4933.42] Yeah,
[4933.42 → 4934.20] that's fascinating.
[4935.20 → 4938.94] I wonder if that's just because them migrating off of Slack,
[4938.94 → 4940.88] because that was an acquired company,
[4940.96 → 4941.08] right?
[4941.12 → 4941.64] So if,
[4941.64 → 4950.44] if migrating them off of Slack would be a huge issue with something that I would really like to accomplish this coming year is to simplify our setup because we,
[4950.56 → 4952.30] right now we have Slack for float plane.
[4952.46 → 4954.70] We have teams for everything else.
[4954.70 → 4955.14] Um,
[4955.86 → 4958.26] and we have not just teams,
[4958.34 → 4959.04] but we have office three,
[4959.12 → 4959.26] six,
[4959.34 → 4959.66] five,
[4959.66 → 4962.68] and we have G suite for everybody.
[4962.68 → 4965.16] And it ends up being really expensive.
[4965.72 → 4966.24] Um,
[4967.46 → 4968.78] meat is so far behind teams.
[4968.86 → 4969.28] What?
[4969.38 → 4970.36] I don't agree.
[4971.26 → 4971.70] Oh,
[4971.82 → 4972.02] oh,
[4972.12 → 4972.40] sorry.
[4972.54 → 4972.76] Oh,
[4972.86 → 4973.02] sorry.
[4973.08 → 4973.20] Sorry,
[4973.20 → 4973.28] sorry.
[4973.28 → 4973.42] Sorry.
[4973.52 → 4973.74] No,
[4973.82 → 4974.48] I do agree.
[4974.62 → 4976.84] I thought you were talking about just the call.
[4977.06 → 4978.44] Why are they both called meat?
[4978.44 → 4983.96] Just the video call of meat is like perfect.
[4984.96 → 4985.88] I hate that.
[4985.92 → 4987.10] It's the same name for the chat.
[4987.56 → 4987.96] Whatever.
[4988.14 → 4988.36] Anyway,
[4988.36 → 4989.24] sorry about that.
[4989.62 → 4990.06] Um,
[4990.58 → 4991.14] but yeah,
[4991.14 → 4999.68] so we use just all of them internally, and I've been kind of poking around lately trying to figure out like how much of a pain it would be for different teams to lose one or the other.
[4999.68 → 5002.58] Like if we lost G suite or if we lost office three,
[5002.58 → 5002.76] six,
[5002.84 → 5002.98] five,
[5003.16 → 5004.52] our subscriptions.
[5004.96 → 5005.40] Oh,
[5005.44 → 5006.06] it's so expensive.
[5006.30 → 5006.44] Okay.
[5006.50 → 5007.80] We're okay.
[5007.86 → 5008.28] Spoiler.
[5008.46 → 5009.56] I'm going to spoil something.
[5009.76 → 5011.14] We're finally doing it.
[5011.30 → 5014.54] We're finally working on how does LMG spend money?
[5014.96 → 5018.20] Cause you guys have asked us that every time we do.
[5018.24 → 5019.52] How does LMG make money?
[5019.62 → 5020.54] You guys are like,
[5020.58 → 5021.06] okay,
[5021.40 → 5021.92] neat,
[5022.52 → 5024.70] but we got,
[5025.04 → 5026.00] where does it come from?
[5026.10 → 5027.68] But we don't know where does it go?
[5028.16 → 5028.58] Um,
[5028.58 → 5030.48] sorry,
[5030.54 → 5031.18] that was really awful.
[5031.60 → 5032.00] Um,
[5032.36 → 5033.80] how do you spend it?
[5034.12 → 5036.44] And so it's finally coming.
[5036.62 → 5037.58] We're going to do a breakdown.
[5038.36 → 5045.12] And while the percentage going to subscriptions is probably not going to look that bad.
[5045.42 → 5045.90] The
[5045.94 → 5046.14] the
[5046.14 → 5048.22] the total amount is high.
[5048.38 → 5049.76] The sheer dollars.
[5051.08 → 5051.56] Yeah.
[5051.76 → 5052.18] Yes.
[5052.54 → 5052.86] It's,
[5052.86 → 5053.42] it's too much.
[5053.54 → 5053.96] We have to,
[5054.08 → 5054.92] we have to crunch that down.
[5055.24 → 5055.60] Um,
[5056.02 → 5058.56] I feel a little bit vindicated about this.
[5058.56 → 5063.62] I think it's going to be harder to get off of G suite than it will to be got off,
[5063.88 → 5064.84] to get off of office,
[5064.98 → 5065.72] Office 365.
[5066.18 → 5067.96] Although part of that reasoning,
[5067.96 → 5068.56] um,
[5070.02 → 5072.84] so basically there are just a few teams that I've talked to, and they're like,
[5072.90 → 5073.02] dude,
[5073.02 → 5074.00] if I lose drive,
[5074.00 → 5075.46] my life is over.
[5075.84 → 5076.34] Um,
[5076.82 → 5077.38] and I,
[5077.38 → 5080.90] I really don't think one drive and share,
[5081.12 → 5082.82] share point.
[5082.90 → 5083.70] Is that the
[5084.14 → 5084.50] whatever?
[5084.68 → 5085.08] Uh,
[5085.08 → 5089.64] I really don't think those are like a suitable replacement for drive.
[5089.64 → 5090.64] I have to confess.
[5090.64 → 5094.48] I haven't played around with one drive that much recently,
[5094.48 → 5098.76] but the way that drives user interface has degraded over the years.
[5099.20 → 5100.74] Maybe it's not that far off anymore.
[5100.86 → 5102.42] This is a huge part of my point.
[5102.54 → 5102.76] Yeah.
[5102.92 → 5103.24] I mean,
[5103.28 → 5105.76] is it time for us to consider like,
[5105.84 → 5106.28] um,
[5106.48 → 5106.72] Oh,
[5106.76 → 5107.30] what's their nuts.
[5107.58 → 5108.06] Um,
[5109.02 → 5109.56] they always,
[5109.68 → 5110.64] they always send me emails.
[5111.68 → 5114.30] One of my issues is there,
[5114.48 → 5118.70] there doesn't really seem like there's actually a whole solution for everything.
[5119.28 → 5119.68] Um,
[5119.84 → 5121.00] like I know,
[5121.00 → 5121.88] um,
[5122.88 → 5123.38] again,
[5123.38 → 5125.10] that company that asked about the passwords,
[5125.20 → 5126.52] I'm still not going to disclose who it was.
[5126.62 → 5128.56] I asked them what they use, and they were like,
[5128.68 → 5129.18] Oh yeah.
[5129.36 → 5129.76] I mean,
[5129.76 → 5131.96] we use G suite Slack and D and,
[5132.02 → 5132.20] uh,
[5132.20 → 5133.08] Office 365.
[5133.08 → 5133.70] And I was like,
[5133.74 → 5133.92] Oh,
[5133.92 → 5134.22] okay.
[5134.74 → 5135.02] Oh yeah.
[5135.02 → 5136.76] Like we're not the only one stuck in this.
[5136.90 → 5137.12] Oh yeah.
[5137.12 → 5137.58] Next cloud.
[5137.68 → 5138.04] Next cloud.
[5138.10 → 5138.56] That's the one.
[5138.64 → 5138.98] Thank you.
[5139.02 → 5140.20] Monster and float plane chat.
[5140.52 → 5141.08] I mean,
[5141.08 → 5142.40] is it time to explore that?
[5142.90 → 5145.60] You want to move email?
[5146.30 → 5146.98] Not really.
[5147.48 → 5147.68] No,
[5147.72 → 5148.44] I don't want to.
[5148.96 → 5149.10] No,
[5149.14 → 5150.12] I don't want to.
[5152.20 → 5152.60] Oh,
[5152.86 → 5154.58] it just looks like so much work.
[5155.52 → 5155.96] Dude,
[5156.04 → 5156.62] migrating,
[5157.02 → 5157.48] migrating,
[5157.48 → 5158.42] uh,
[5158.48 → 5163.18] a G suite drive to a G suite drive is a nightmare.
[5164.18 → 5166.04] Let alone anywhere else.
[5167.06 → 5167.50] Um,
[5167.50 → 5167.82] but,
[5167.82 → 5167.84] but,
[5167.84 → 5169.68] but then you run into other issues where like,
[5170.00 → 5170.40] you know,
[5170.50 → 5171.76] next cloud or G suite or whatever,
[5171.84 → 5172.68] none of them are going to do this.
[5173.50 → 5177.56] Microsoft AD is just fantastic for a bunch of different things.
[5177.80 → 5179.76] And then to authenticate with that properly,
[5179.90 → 5180.12] Dan,
[5180.16 → 5180.90] you can correct me here.
[5180.96 → 5181.50] Don't you need,
[5181.50 → 5182.46] uh,
[5182.46 → 5184.66] some license from Microsoft?
[5184.66 → 5185.56] Oh,
[5185.56 → 5186.70] you need so many licenses.
[5187.52 → 5187.80] Yeah.
[5188.06 → 5188.52] So like,
[5188.72 → 5191.30] you just kind of get stuck with like everything.
[5191.54 → 5191.68] Yeah.
[5191.82 → 5194.76] And the alternative is you can cancel a subscription,
[5194.76 → 5199.36] but then you're like actually going to lower your productivity of all your users.
[5199.36 → 5200.20] And not just that,
[5200.30 → 5201.58] but you're going to lower their morale.
[5201.98 → 5204.24] Conrad's in the full plane chat right now saying,
[5204.36 → 5204.52] no,
[5204.62 → 5205.86] let me have my Google Drive.
[5205.96 → 5206.68] It's so painless.
[5206.80 → 5207.66] And you know what?
[5207.66 → 5222.56] I experienced the exact same thing at NCI because we had our own internal email, and then we switched to Gmail, and it was a time of gloriousness because that was back when Gmail was perfect and the search was perfect.
[5222.74 → 5229.90] And then we migrated back to our internal email with just like a reskin to make it look more like Gmail.
[5230.80 → 5233.88] And there were riots in the streets, and I was,
[5233.96 → 5234.64] I was one of them.
[5234.70 → 5235.70] I was on the leadership team,
[5235.76 → 5237.20] but I had nothing to do with this decision.
[5237.20 → 5237.76] And I was like,
[5237.80 → 5238.92] I freaking hate this.
[5239.32 → 5244.90] I am worth the $7 a month or whatever it was back then to have proper working email.
[5244.92 → 5246.32] The problem is it's not $7 a month anymore.
[5246.50 → 5246.68] Well,
[5246.82 → 5247.38] I know.
[5248.84 → 5250.12] And one thing that really,
[5250.22 → 5250.38] okay.
[5250.48 → 5253.64] So I had basically just resigned to like,
[5253.66 → 5253.90] I mean,
[5253.96 → 5254.24] okay.
[5254.24 → 5255.90] So urban fervour and Chad is saying,
[5255.98 → 5256.94] this is so ironic.
[5256.94 → 5262.70] Our company's in the middle of migrating from G suite Office 365, and it has not been going well.
[5263.18 → 5265.30] Some other people are posting similar things.
[5265.62 → 5266.06] Guys,
[5266.06 → 5266.92] next cloud,
[5267.04 → 5268.76] I actually think is super cool,
[5269.06 → 5270.92] but migrating to them is,
[5271.12 → 5272.78] it's not like,
[5272.90 → 5273.04] you know,
[5273.12 → 5275.34] the problem is migrating stuff is insane.
[5275.58 → 5280.68] And there are certain features that are difficult to replace once we're already in this spot.
[5280.84 → 5281.08] Anyway,
[5281.22 → 5281.50] I'm not,
[5281.70 → 5282.30] next cloud is great.
[5282.30 → 5284.06] I'm not talking bad against next cloud.
[5285.40 → 5287.48] But yeah,
[5287.48 → 5287.82] we just,
[5287.88 → 5288.72] we just get entrenched.
[5288.94 → 5289.14] There's,
[5289.14 → 5292.64] there are too many things that are too good that they're worth paying for it anyway,
[5292.64 → 5295.06] even though we're not using most of their offerings.
[5295.32 → 5295.76] Yeah.
[5295.76 → 5298.18] And I had previously resigned to like,
[5298.38 → 5298.76] whatever,
[5298.98 → 5300.44] it's worth it per employee.
[5300.58 → 5302.34] We're just not going to talk about this anymore.
[5302.38 → 5303.72] But it's so much now.
[5304.44 → 5305.82] And then G suite,
[5305.82 → 5311.44] I had like fought with someone over there for a while being like,
[5311.54 → 5312.96] I do not want your AI features.
[5313.10 → 5314.72] I don't care how much you discount it.
[5314.88 → 5315.36] I like,
[5315.52 → 5316.80] I don't want this.
[5316.88 → 5317.74] We're not taking it.
[5317.78 → 5319.52] We're not paying for AI features.
[5319.64 → 5320.20] Go away.
[5320.20 → 5321.08] Um,
[5321.08 → 5322.26] and I finally got through to them.
[5322.82 → 5325.12] So we didn't subscribe to their AI features.
[5325.26 → 5327.78] And then now you just have to,
[5328.28 → 5331.20] it's just bundled in.
[5331.30 → 5331.94] Have fun.
[5332.74 → 5333.36] And it's like,
[5333.40 → 5333.68] man,
[5333.90 → 5334.14] I,
[5334.38 → 5336.60] I don't want this.
[5337.06 → 5337.50] Um,
[5337.74 → 5339.92] so then I was like,
[5339.96 → 5340.16] okay,
[5340.16 → 5343.14] well now it's like really expensive per user.
[5343.26 → 5343.44] Yeah.
[5343.44 → 5346.38] It would be really nice to lower this cost for the company.
[5346.56 → 5347.90] Let's evaluate it again.
[5347.90 → 5350.18] And we look into it, and we just come back to the company.
[5350.18 → 5351.24] The same conclusion again.
[5351.36 → 5355.18] It's almost like they're charging this much because they know they've got you
[5355.18 → 5357.18] by the nostrils.
[5358.72 → 5359.16] Yeah,
[5359.28 → 5359.58] sure.
[5359.70 → 5360.54] We'll go with that one.
[5361.06 → 5361.50] Um,
[5361.98 → 5362.42] but it's,
[5362.42 → 5362.98] it's frustrating,
[5363.10 → 5363.26] man.
[5363.56 → 5364.08] I wish,
[5364.24 → 5366.26] I wish Microsoft does everything,
[5366.26 → 5369.30] but they don't seem to do almost any of it all that well.
[5369.84 → 5372.94] Google doesn't do enough of things.
[5373.86 → 5378.04] And they do a few things like really well.
[5378.04 → 5380.66] And they do other things like really poorly.
[5380.92 → 5382.98] If we had just never migrated to teams.
[5383.30 → 5383.74] Yeah.
[5383.82 → 5390.04] Like I think we probably would have just still been using chat, and it probably would have been fine.
[5390.04 → 5393.34] Cause the nice thing about it was you only had one search window.
[5393.82 → 5396.48] That's the killer for me is that I have to,
[5396.60 → 5398.64] the more applications we use,
[5398.64 → 5403.60] the more search fields I have to type something into to figure out.
[5403.60 → 5404.00] Yeah.
[5404.02 → 5405.16] Where did we talk about that?
[5405.66 → 5406.60] Was it on email?
[5406.94 → 5409.08] Was it posted on air table?
[5409.26 → 5410.88] Was it posted in teams?
[5411.08 → 5411.48] Was it,
[5411.48 → 5412.64] what are you,
[5412.64 → 5414.26] what are you talking in a Google doc?
[5414.48 → 5416.34] Like when you're searching for something,
[5416.34 → 5417.68] like if I'm,
[5417.74 → 5419.64] cause like the way that my memory works,
[5419.66 → 5420.98] a lot of the time it's like cues.
[5421.30 → 5421.92] Like I,
[5422.02 → 5424.28] I don't remember what someone said in the email,
[5424.38 → 5427.04] but I know we were talking about yetis,
[5427.52 → 5427.80] you know,
[5427.80 → 5428.28] or whatever.
[5428.44 → 5429.14] So I'll be like,
[5429.16 → 5429.32] okay,
[5429.32 → 5429.48] yeah,
[5429.48 → 5429.88] I remember,
[5429.94 → 5431.26] I remember the word yeti was in there.
[5431.32 → 5433.18] So I searched my email for like yeti.
[5433.30 → 5434.26] Because I'm trying to remember,
[5434.38 → 5434.46] or,
[5434.52 → 5435.46] or like some product,
[5435.56 → 5435.76] you know,
[5436.00 → 5436.96] gigabyte motherboard.
[5437.20 → 5437.54] Like,
[5437.62 → 5437.80] ah,
[5437.88 → 5438.28] no,
[5438.34 → 5438.68] that's not,
[5438.74 → 5439.06] it's not there.
[5439.12 → 5439.26] Maybe,
[5439.34 → 5440.14] maybe it was in teams.
[5440.26 → 5441.78] So I throw it into my team search.
[5442.36 → 5442.68] No,
[5442.74 → 5443.48] it wasn't there either.
[5443.48 → 5443.76] Like,
[5443.94 → 5444.14] okay,
[5444.16 → 5445.36] maybe it was on an air table,
[5445.70 → 5446.66] a card or something.
[5446.76 → 5447.84] So I searched for it on air table.
[5447.84 → 5451.46] And it's like this tedious process of going and trying to find something.
[5451.78 → 5452.40] Cause you know,
[5452.46 → 5455.26] around here we have a hundred projects going at any given time.
[5455.46 → 5455.82] Yeah.
[5455.86 → 5459.38] I can't be expected to remember everything about every single one of them from
[5459.38 → 5460.18] start to completion.
[5460.18 → 5460.62] So,
[5461.04 → 5461.48] so a lot,
[5461.52 → 5461.96] so you just,
[5462.06 → 5466.00] you waste these cycles going back and trying to re-reference materials.
[5466.00 → 5467.18] And if you don't know where to find them,
[5467.20 → 5468.30] it can be really frustrating.
[5468.50 → 5470.40] And back when we were on hangouts and Gmail,
[5470.72 → 5471.52] you would just,
[5471.62 → 5474.84] there was one search bar, and it would search both of them at the same time.
[5474.86 → 5475.72] And it was really convenient.
[5476.32 → 5476.64] Um,
[5476.92 → 5477.82] but,
[5477.84 → 5479.56] the more services that we've integrated,
[5479.66 → 5481.24] and I understand there are reasons that we've done it.
[5481.28 → 5482.10] Like when we added Trello,
[5482.18 → 5482.66] for instance,
[5482.84 → 5487.02] the more places there have been to go find the single source of truth.
[5487.14 → 5488.60] And air table has been a help there,
[5488.70 → 5495.04] but it's still not a perfect silver bullet because it is still separate.
[5495.04 → 5495.24] No,
[5495.30 → 5495.72] and we'll,
[5495.80 → 5497.10] we'll keep making it better,
[5497.20 → 5498.80] but it will still never be perfect.
[5498.96 → 5499.12] Yeah.
[5499.22 → 5501.18] And none of these things will be perfect,
[5501.18 → 5503.50] but I really don't like the fragmentation that we have.
[5503.64 → 5505.26] I also really don't like that.
[5505.34 → 5505.58] Like,
[5505.58 → 5509.24] no matter what we like say,
[5509.24 → 5509.84] um,
[5509.84 → 5510.40] um,
[5510.48 → 5513.00] these programs are very invasive.
[5513.68 → 5514.34] So like,
[5514.38 → 5515.36] even if we say like,
[5515.42 → 5515.70] Hey,
[5515.70 → 5520.16] I know we have Office 365.
[5520.16 → 5522.06] We don't use their email.
[5522.28 → 5523.66] We don't use their calendar.
[5523.98 → 5525.82] We don't use one drive.
[5525.90 → 5526.98] We don't use all these things.
[5527.10 → 5528.08] Please keep it in Google.
[5528.72 → 5529.16] Um,
[5529.16 → 5530.22] we can say that,
[5530.22 → 5532.38] but if you work in word or whatever,
[5532.38 → 5534.70] it's going to try to prompt you to save it into one drive.
[5534.70 → 5538.64] And then people just start doing it automatically because they don't necessarily know the difference
[5538.64 → 5539.06] because they're,
[5539.28 → 5541.24] they might not be tech-savvy or whatever,
[5541.24 → 5543.02] or that's just what they use in the previous company.
[5543.02 → 5544.30] So they don't even think about it.
[5544.30 → 5546.68] It doesn't really register that they might be doing it the wrong way.
[5547.22 → 5547.66] Uh,
[5547.74 → 5548.22] it's,
[5548.32 → 5548.66] uh,
[5549.52 → 5549.96] it's a mess,
[5550.04 → 5550.18] man.
[5550.22 → 5550.80] It's very frustrating.
[5550.80 → 5552.50] Magnetics and float plane chat says,
[5552.60 → 5552.66] Hey,
[5552.70 → 5554.04] maybe check out X one search.
[5554.10 → 5556.40] It provides unified search across Microsoft Teams,
[5556.58 → 5556.90] outlook,
[5557.06 → 5557.42] SharePoint,
[5557.54 → 5557.92] one drive,
[5558.00 → 5558.20] Gmail,
[5558.38 → 5558.78] Google Drive,
[5558.82 → 5559.30] and Slack.
[5559.44 → 5559.92] Wow.
[5559.96 → 5560.48] So cool.
[5560.76 → 5563.96] Why don't I get another go Ram subscription?
[5564.44 → 5564.88] No,
[5565.08 → 5566.74] I don't want that.
[5567.30 → 5568.32] What is it called?
[5568.44 → 5569.06] What is this?
[5569.30 → 5570.46] X one.com.
[5572.28 → 5575.44] That does legitimately sound very cool,
[5575.54 → 5576.22] but like,
[5576.22 → 5576.78] Oh,
[5577.60 → 5578.54] no.
[5580.80 → 5586.40] Yeah.
[5589.62 → 5590.06] Cool.
[5590.94 → 5591.38] Hey,
[5591.66 → 5592.04] Oh,
[5592.24 → 5592.46] wait,
[5592.56 → 5592.64] no,
[5592.70 → 5592.96] never mind.
[5593.04 → 5593.60] I'm not going to say that.
[5593.62 → 5594.28] Is this per user?
[5594.70 → 5595.70] I couldn't tell.
[5595.86 → 5596.78] I was afraid to,
[5596.84 → 5598.36] I was afraid to even ask.
[5598.84 → 5599.72] I don't want to know.
[5599.88 → 5600.94] I don't know if it is.
[5603.26 → 5606.68] And wouldn't they get access to literally all of you're everything?
[5606.82 → 5607.18] I mean,
[5607.24 → 5608.30] it kind of seems that way.
[5608.34 → 5608.88] This thing's,
[5608.88 → 5609.82] this thing's terrible.
[5609.82 → 5610.50] They should pay us.
[5610.80 → 5614.32] That's actually how much they pay you per user.
[5614.42 → 5615.00] To be clear,
[5615.24 → 5617.60] you're not saying they're not trustworthy bros.
[5617.98 → 5618.32] No.
[5618.52 → 5620.22] We just don't know that they are.
[5620.34 → 5621.08] That's all.
[5621.26 → 5622.36] That's all we're saying.
[5622.64 → 5623.58] All we're saying.
[5627.30 → 5627.78] So,
[5628.18 → 5628.54] yeah,
[5628.62 → 5629.22] I don't know.
[5629.74 → 5630.58] Maybe just,
[5630.98 → 5631.74] how about this?
[5633.08 → 5634.36] Everyone watching right now,
[5634.36 → 5635.42] how many of you are there?
[5636.26 → 5639.18] Probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of around 10,000.
[5639.28 → 5639.42] Okay.
[5639.48 → 5640.50] Everyone watching right now,
[5640.68 → 5641.48] go buy a WAN hoodie.
[5641.92 → 5642.54] And then,
[5642.64 → 5645.06] I won't have to think about the subscription costs ever again.
[5645.76 → 5645.96] Deal?
[5646.00 → 5646.68] It won't matter.
[5646.92 → 5647.18] Deal.
[5647.46 → 5647.82] Nice.
[5647.82 → 5650.08] I just,
[5650.18 → 5650.60] I wish,
[5650.64 → 5651.18] I wish like,
[5651.26 → 5651.58] it's,
[5651.66 → 5652.76] it's a constant,
[5653.28 → 5655.04] extremely sharp thorn in my side.
[5655.14 → 5656.48] It bothers me all the time.
[5656.48 → 5656.64] Um,
[5656.64 → 5657.48] um,
[5657.48 → 5661.56] speaking of merch messages,
[5661.66 → 5661.82] Dan,
[5661.88 → 5663.32] should we do a couple, or what are we supposed to be doing?
[5663.40 → 5663.90] Oh my God,
[5663.90 → 5664.96] we haven't done sponsor spots.
[5665.16 → 5665.42] Uh,
[5665.46 → 5667.94] we're going to do the float plane announce and then a sponsor spot.
[5668.12 → 5668.46] Uh,
[5668.50 → 5668.90] sure.
[5670.10 → 5670.42] Uh,
[5670.74 → 5671.00] oh,
[5671.56 → 5671.84] uh,
[5671.84 → 5672.04] oh,
[5672.08 → 5673.34] that's the float plane topic.
[5673.34 → 5675.90] Not to be confused with the float plane announcements.
[5677.12 → 5677.60] Yes,
[5677.76 → 5678.04] Sammy,
[5678.12 → 5679.76] I will read them before sponsors.
[5680.18 → 5685.26] We've got three juicy and unique offerings for you on float plane.
[5685.26 → 5685.78] We,
[5686.02 → 5686.26] one,
[5686.60 → 5690.36] we have an LTT video that is ready right now in early access.
[5690.64 → 5694.26] The liquid metal in my laptop leaked, and my mission is,
[5694.96 → 5696.70] is to try to fix it.
[5696.78 → 5700.38] And you can check that out over on the float plane.
[5701.58 → 5702.10] Um,
[5702.22 → 5706.16] it was a very frustrating experience.
[5706.28 → 5706.44] Oh,
[5706.72 → 5707.44] I don't see it.
[5707.54 → 5709.40] Am I supposed to publish it or is,
[5709.42 → 5710.34] what are you looking for?
[5710.60 → 5711.92] I'm looking for,
[5711.96 → 5713.84] is it under float plane exclusives for now?
[5714.36 → 5714.84] No,
[5714.90 → 5715.44] it's not.
[5716.24 → 5716.76] Uh,
[5716.82 → 5717.06] okay.
[5717.20 → 5717.52] I'm super,
[5717.52 → 5718.30] what are you looking for?
[5718.48 → 5718.94] That video,
[5719.28 → 5719.44] the
[5719.56 → 5719.72] I,
[5719.84 → 5722.04] my laptop leaked liquid metal video.
[5722.76 → 5723.24] Oh,
[5723.40 → 5724.92] I'm supposed to show it in the CMS.
[5725.14 → 5725.76] Talk about the video.
[5725.84 → 5726.20] If you want,
[5726.36 → 5728.06] we also have auto captioning on float plane.
[5728.14 → 5728.36] Now,
[5728.62 → 5730.46] even for LTT videos.
[5730.54 → 5730.76] Okay.
[5730.82 → 5731.04] Yes.
[5731.04 → 5732.34] So I'm supposed to go into the CMS.
[5732.48 → 5734.50] Am I supposed to go into the CMS on camera?
[5735.30 → 5735.56] Nope.
[5735.92 → 5736.50] Are you sure?
[5737.08 → 5738.60] Cause Sammy told me to do it.
[5738.66 → 5739.36] He's going to do it.
[5739.42 → 5739.70] Luke.
[5740.06 → 5741.08] You've done it before.
[5741.38 → 5741.86] Uh,
[5741.86 → 5743.04] but the answer is still no.
[5743.32 → 5743.88] I'm not,
[5743.96 → 5745.56] I'm not saying what you're going to do.
[5745.60 → 5747.00] I'm just saying what you're supposed to do.
[5747.08 → 5747.52] I see.
[5749.20 → 5749.80] Got it.
[5750.38 → 5750.86] Okay.
[5751.12 → 5752.30] Release status public.
[5752.44 → 5753.10] There it is.
[5754.60 → 5754.96] Uh,
[5755.08 → 5756.18] very much,
[5756.26 → 5760.40] very much a downer and very much now live on float plane.
[5760.50 → 5761.06] There you have it.
[5761.96 → 5762.26] Cool.
[5762.34 → 5762.76] Good chat.
[5762.98 → 5764.82] Number two for Halloween,
[5765.10 → 5767.56] three staff members dressed up as yours truly,
[5767.56 → 5770.82] as you might've seen in last weeks when intro and on our socials.
[5770.82 → 5771.78] Oh,
[5771.88 → 5778.18] we did a video of the entire process from makeup to clothing to my first reaction to it.
[5778.20 → 5778.28] Yeah.
[5778.30 → 5782.76] They completely blind sided me with this open link.
[5782.94 → 5783.60] Show the stuff.
[5783.68 → 5784.02] Okay.
[5784.12 → 5784.38] Yes,
[5784.42 → 5784.56] sir.
[5784.58 → 5784.86] Sammy.
[5784.92 → 5785.94] I will follow instructions.
[5786.04 → 5786.54] There you go.
[5786.94 → 5787.64] This was,
[5787.84 → 5791.58] they,
[5791.76 → 5792.36] um,
[5792.68 → 5794.92] they really were trying to get me cancelled.
[5794.92 → 5796.10] I think with all of this,
[5796.16 → 5797.48] I think it was Sammy.
[5797.48 → 5797.88] He goes,
[5798.04 → 5799.28] so I'm Asian Linus.
[5799.28 → 5801.82] This is female Linus.
[5802.68 → 5803.64] What's this?
[5805.72 → 5806.36] Oh,
[5806.66 → 5807.32] I'm just like,
[5807.46 → 5807.82] buddy.
[5808.56 → 5809.52] Talented Linus.
[5809.62 → 5809.98] Yeah.
[5810.58 → 5813.78] Don't even do.
[5814.90 → 5815.34] Why?
[5817.34 → 5817.94] Um,
[5817.94 → 5819.12] I don't remember what I said,
[5819.20 → 5820.64] but I'm pretty sure I'm not cancelled.
[5821.20 → 5821.62] Um,
[5822.18 → 5822.56] nice.
[5822.72 → 5823.26] Finally,
[5824.34 → 5824.74] uh,
[5824.74 → 5828.58] we're doing a Luke Cafetière Q and a for a float plane exclusive.
[5828.58 → 5831.00] And we want your questions.
[5831.42 → 5834.90] I'm supposed to open the link and showcase some of the questions.
[5835.56 → 5837.76] Tell us the head dent story again.
[5837.86 → 5838.80] I forgot it.
[5839.56 → 5840.00] Oh,
[5840.12 → 5840.50] yeah.
[5840.58 → 5840.74] I mean,
[5840.74 → 5844.06] that's the thing about people with a dent in their head is they might forget the story too.
[5844.44 → 5844.72] Anyway,
[5844.72 → 5848.72] the point is gone and submit your questions for the Luke Q and a video.
[5851.44 → 5853.02] I caught a stray there.
[5853.12 → 5853.40] All right.
[5853.60 → 5856.60] Submit fast because we're filming sooner rather than later.
[5856.60 → 5860.60] We're also cooking up some amazing content and deals.
[5862.68 → 5863.58] Early Black Friday,
[5863.66 → 5866.34] Cyber Monday coming for subscribers.
[5866.46 → 5869.88] So don't miss out at LMG dot G slash float plane.
[5870.62 → 5871.22] All right.
[5872.00 → 5872.26] Now,
[5872.34 → 5872.94] now what Dan,
[5873.02 → 5875.16] it still says float plane announced there sponsor one,

[5903.36 → 5909.40] Squarespace also offers a full suite of prebuilt layouts and an easy use drag and drop
[5909.40 → 5910.00] interface.
[5910.14 → 5911.88] You were at the gym with me recently.
[5911.88 → 5912.32] You know,
[5912.32 → 5913.08] I can't do that.

[5927.22 → 5931.90] visiting squarespace.com slash when the show is also brought to you by AMD.
[5932.48 → 5933.42] Earlier this week,
[5933.42 → 5940.26] we released another AMD ultimate $5,000 tech upgrade where we upgraded John,
[5940.26 → 5943.08] our senior test technicians set up.
[5943.08 → 5946.02] He snagged himself a new OLED TV,
[5946.56 → 5947.88] a racing SIM setup,
[5948.22 → 5951.66] and a big screen beyond two VR headsets.
[5952.14 → 5954.66] If you want to learn more about why he chose those items,
[5954.66 → 5956.02] you will have to watch the video.
[5958.10 → 5958.62] And,
[5958.98 → 5959.28] oh,
[5959.38 → 5962.52] we're going completely away from talking about John's upgrade.
[5962.94 → 5966.92] While John has stuck with his ever reliable 5700 X 3D,
[5967.38 → 5970.76] AMD recently released their 9,000 series thread rippers.
[5971.36 → 5971.84] I mean,
[5971.98 → 5972.32] sure,
[5972.44 → 5975.72] going with a thread ripper could use up most of someone's ultimate upgrade budget,
[5975.86 → 5977.00] but there are benefits,
[5977.00 → 5980.40] especially if your computer handles heavy workloads like 3d editing,
[5980.54 → 5981.12] 3d rendering,
[5981.30 → 5982.18] or AI development.
[5982.70 → 5983.52] And now,
[5983.78 → 5984.94] this is where things get really exciting.
[5985.22 → 5987.38] You can win one of two 9,000 series bundles,
[5987.54 → 5989.02] each including a thread ripper CPU,
[5989.24 → 5990.06] a compatible motherboard,
[5990.26 → 5992.66] and a Radeon AI pro R700.
[5993.52 → 5995.78] That is a sick giveaway.
[5996.30 → 5999.16] All you've got to do is use our link in the video description.
[5999.50 → 6001.14] Fox NC in the chat.
[6001.62 → 6002.10] Stop.
[6002.42 → 6004.20] Intel's already dead.
[6004.58 → 6004.98] Stop.
[6004.98 → 6008.16] Oh,
[6008.34 → 6008.76] Lord.
[6008.98 → 6009.38] Wow.
[6009.46 → 6010.14] What a giveaway.
[6011.14 → 6012.46] That's freaking awesome.
[6013.00 → 6013.36] Um,
[6013.42 → 6013.54] you know,
[6013.60 → 6016.90] I think there's a correlation to Intel's performance and them,
[6016.90 → 6019.80] and them not doing extreme rig upgrade anymore.
[6020.26 → 6020.84] You think so?
[6021.24 → 6021.70] Yeah,
[6021.74 → 6022.12] I think so.
[6022.12 → 6025.94] You think not selling enough CPUs means you can't afford sponsorships?
[6026.52 → 6026.82] No,
[6026.90 → 6027.82] I mean the other way around.
[6028.20 → 6028.56] Oh,
[6029.00 → 6029.44] no,
[6029.50 → 6029.60] no,
[6029.60 → 6029.72] no,
[6029.72 → 6030.08] it was,
[6030.08 → 6031.48] it was Intel bailed on it.
[6031.48 → 6035.36] Why is this my point?
[6036.16 → 6036.56] Oh,
[6036.76 → 6037.96] oh,
[6038.08 → 6038.58] like they,
[6038.66 → 6040.98] they felt unworthy to have money spent on them.
[6041.12 → 6042.02] They were insecure.
[6042.30 → 6042.62] What?
[6043.04 → 6043.54] I don't know.
[6043.54 → 6044.88] I don't know what you're talking about.
[6045.00 → 6045.30] No,
[6045.42 → 6050.02] that the ad like worked so well that it was making up that much of their sales.
[6050.34 → 6050.76] Oh,
[6050.86 → 6051.38] for AMD.
[6052.46 → 6052.98] Or wait,
[6053.16 → 6053.40] because,
[6053.58 → 6054.58] no,
[6054.68 → 6054.82] wait,
[6054.82 → 6055.16] oh,
[6055.24 → 6055.84] I get it.
[6059.72 → 6061.64] I might've said that horribly wrong.
[6061.80 → 6062.36] I don't know.
[6063.06 → 6064.30] But that was crazy.
[6064.54 → 6064.74] No,
[6064.82 → 6065.88] I think chat's with you.
[6066.52 → 6067.02] All right.
[6067.12 → 6067.44] Okay.
[6069.12 → 6071.88] This is what happens when you flip your pillow the wrong way,
[6071.98 → 6072.30] Linus.
[6072.38 → 6073.64] What are you even talking about?
[6074.42 → 6076.40] I think it just means you got a bad sleep, and you're tired.
[6076.44 → 6076.64] Oh,
[6076.74 → 6077.00] dude.
[6077.08 → 6077.84] Viewers and listeners,
[6078.10 → 6078.96] this is not a bit.
[6079.24 → 6079.74] A hundred percent.
[6080.02 → 6081.30] He's just like this.
[6082.52 → 6082.92] Thanks,
[6083.04 → 6083.66] Dan.
[6087.74 → 6088.18] Okay.
[6089.50 → 6089.94] Um,
[6090.66 → 6091.12] oh,
[6091.22 → 6091.50] wait,
[6091.62 → 6093.54] we missed one of the CW announcements.
[6094.66 → 6096.42] We never talked about the buy more,
[6096.58 → 6097.92] save more deal on all apparel.
[6099.50 → 6100.64] My poor fingers.
[6101.16 → 6101.56] Uh,
[6101.62 → 6101.92] okay.
[6101.98 → 6104.70] So this will be the last promotional mention on the show,
[6104.80 → 6105.42] uh,
[6105.44 → 6106.60] on LTT store.
[6106.70 → 6107.52] We're running a buy more,
[6107.66 → 6109.24] save more deal on all apparel.

[6113.28 → 6115.48] 15% off of all three of them.
[6115.82 → 6119.32] Four items gets you 20% off of all four of them.
[6119.32 → 6125.26] And five items gets you 25% off of all five of them.
[6125.26 → 6126.96] You can check it out at LMG.
[6126.96 → 6127.26] Um,
[6127.26 → 6128.88] you can check it out at LMG.GG slash apparel.
[6128.98 → 6133.16] This is a great time to grab gifts early for yourself or for other people,
[6133.34 → 6134.34] whichever way you like.
[6134.42 → 6135.08] There's no judgment.
[6135.66 → 6135.96] And,
[6136.04 → 6136.48] uh,
[6136.54 → 6140.40] you can check that out here.
[6140.40 → 6142.54] LEG.GG slash apparel.
[6142.54 → 6147.62] So we've got all the back from the dead shirts that we relaunched last week.
[6147.62 → 6149.10] We've got the glitch shirt.
[6149.22 → 6151.64] We've got our awesome screensaver party shirts.
[6151.72 → 6152.36] We've got our underwear.
[6152.68 → 6155.08] We've got some stuff that's great for the office,
[6155.20 → 6156.94] some stuff that's great for lounging at home,
[6156.96 → 6158.18] like the super soft hoodie.
[6158.42 → 6158.86] Uh,
[6158.86 → 6159.24] we still have,
[6159.30 → 6159.36] Oh,
[6159.36 → 6160.94] do we still have some land hoodies kicking around?
[6161.74 → 6162.22] Oh dude,
[6162.26 → 6163.22] we've still got land hoodies.
[6164.44 → 6165.26] These are freaking awesome.
[6166.16 → 6166.60] Um,
[6166.82 → 6169.36] so these are based on when V2,
[6169.88 → 6170.38] um,
[6170.38 → 6171.94] and then the new,
[6171.94 → 6173.38] um,
[6173.54 → 6174.02] there we go.
[6174.10 → 6176.16] New when hoodie is the V3.
[6176.34 → 6177.36] So it is a little more expensive,
[6177.36 → 6177.86] but Hey,
[6177.86 → 6180.04] you can save a bunch if you,
[6180.04 → 6180.48] uh,
[6180.48 → 6181.50] pick up a few items.
[6182.48 → 6183.08] All right.
[6185.18 → 6185.74] All right,
[6185.76 → 6186.14] Dan,
[6186.46 → 6186.90] Dan,
[6187.16 → 6187.56] Luke,
[6187.94 → 6189.46] which one pick one.
[6189.56 → 6189.80] Okay.
[6189.86 → 6190.08] I really,
[6190.34 → 6190.90] what's going on?
[6191.52 → 6193.34] Really have not slept well this week.
[6193.38 → 6194.66] I've been travelling a lot.
[6194.98 → 6195.60] I mean,
[6195.60 → 6197.02] I shouldn't be complaining to you,
[6197.10 → 6199.00] but I think,
[6199.14 → 6201.46] I think I can say that I've been travelling a lot.
[6202.36 → 6205.10] When travelling tend to be easier than yours.
[6205.38 → 6206.80] It has been a very,
[6206.80 → 6208.36] very intense period.
[6208.92 → 6209.12] I,
[6209.12 → 6209.72] I,
[6209.72 → 6210.02] I,
[6210.02 → 6210.32] I,
[6210.32 → 6213.98] I can't tell you all the videos that I have written in the last little while,
[6213.98 → 6215.46] but in the last three weeks,
[6215.46 → 6219.04] I think I've probably written more LTTs like start to finish written.
[6219.04 → 6222.04] And I am heavily involved in the editing of,
[6222.04 → 6222.52] uh,
[6222.52 → 6224.04] the scripts for a lot of stuff,
[6224.04 → 6229.16] but start to finish written more LTTs in the last three weeks than I had
[6229.16 → 6233.24] probably done in the prior six to nine months combined.
[6233.24 → 6234.06] like,
[6234.06 → 6235.56] it's been very,
[6235.68 → 6236.26] very intense.
[6236.26 → 6237.44] I've been really enjoying it.
[6237.44 → 6237.88] Actually,
[6237.88 → 6239.22] it's been fun,
[6239.22 → 6242.10] especially because some of it's been really cool.
[6242.10 → 6244.56] Like some of these factory tours and stuff when I was overseas,
[6244.56 → 6250.78] but it has been extremely intense because the rest of my work doesn't go away just because I'm writing.
[6250.78 → 6251.70] Um,
[6251.98 → 6253.30] I wish it did.
[6253.38 → 6253.88] That'd be cool.
[6255.16 → 6259.08] That's my biggest problem with travelling is effectively the same thing.
[6259.08 → 6259.64] It's like,
[6259.72 → 6260.02] I,
[6260.06 → 6263.14] I think my tasks when I'm travelling tend to be easier than yours,
[6263.14 → 6269.90] but I'm also stuck for many hours of the day.
[6269.90 → 6271.56] Like today I woke up at,
[6271.70 → 6277.16] I think seven and didn't do anything other than work.
[6277.16 → 6277.72] And you know,
[6277.72 → 6278.06] it's eight,
[6278.24 → 6279.02] eight 40 now.
[6279.36 → 6279.88] Um,
[6279.92 → 6283.12] that's decently common on trips because if I wasn't here,
[6283.12 → 6283.84] I would have been,
[6283.84 → 6284.64] uh,
[6284.64 → 6285.10] at the
[6285.10 → 6288.70] the thing that was the following to the event that I was just at.
[6289.18 → 6289.66] Um,
[6291.88 → 6292.56] so I just,
[6292.66 → 6294.60] I don't have time to do a lot of stuff,
[6294.60 → 6297.08] but work keeps moving.
[6297.36 → 6297.58] Yeah.
[6297.62 → 6299.24] So messages keep coming in.
[6299.24 → 6299.68] So it's,
[6299.68 → 6300.00] it's,
[6300.02 → 6300.84] it's tough to keep up.
[6300.94 → 6301.72] Planes can be good,
[6301.72 → 6302.40] but my,
[6302.48 → 6303.96] my last tin can flight,
[6304.06 → 6305.12] there was no in-flight Wi-Fi.
[6305.38 → 6306.64] So I,
[6306.74 → 6308.30] I literally,
[6308.30 → 6310.08] I finished reading salt,
[6310.16 → 6310.36] sugar,
[6310.48 → 6310.74] fat,
[6310.88 → 6313.24] which was that book that Wendell recommended to me about,
[6313.40 → 6313.66] uh,
[6313.66 → 6314.38] I think it's called salt,
[6314.44 → 6314.60] sugar,
[6314.66 → 6314.82] fat,
[6314.90 → 6316.90] how the food industry hooked us or something like that.
[6317.36 → 6318.52] And it's perfect.
[6318.52 → 6319.86] It's a little dry at times,
[6320.02 → 6320.42] but Hey,
[6320.48 → 6322.32] maybe if they put a little more fat on it,
[6322.38 → 6323.64] then it would go down a little easier.
[6323.84 → 6324.20] Hey,
[6324.32 → 6325.12] so yeah,
[6325.14 → 6325.84] it's a little dry,
[6325.98 → 6327.40] but really enlightening,
[6327.64 → 6328.36] super cool book.
[6328.50 → 6328.70] Um,
[6328.70 → 6330.12] so I finished that cause,
[6330.28 → 6330.64] because I was,
[6330.68 → 6332.32] I was just like sitting on the plane going like,
[6333.06 → 6333.50] Oh my God,
[6333.50 → 6334.24] I have nothing to do.
[6334.26 → 6335.88] And there's a computer under the seat in front of me.
[6335.88 → 6336.50] Like just,
[6337.22 → 6338.68] it wasn't a super long flight,
[6338.76 → 6339.14] but I was like,
[6339.22 → 6340.34] I am so bored.
[6340.46 → 6340.56] I,
[6340.60 → 6342.58] I no longer know how to just sit and be.
[6342.90 → 6343.16] Oh,
[6343.20 → 6343.44] right.
[6343.72 → 6344.44] I have salt,
[6344.50 → 6344.64] sugar,
[6344.72 → 6345.46] fat on my Kindle.
[6345.52 → 6348.00] I still have like a quarter of the book left.
[6348.14 → 6353.12] So I read 5% of it and realized that the last 20% of the book was actually,
[6353.12 → 6353.98] uh,
[6354.04 → 6354.16] what,
[6354.22 → 6354.68] what's it called?
[6355.84 → 6356.20] Appendices.
[6356.62 → 6356.98] Yeah.
[6356.98 → 6357.74] So,
[6357.86 → 6358.26] so I,
[6358.32 → 6360.96] so I finished the book in like 20 minutes, and I was like,
[6361.00 → 6361.74] Oh crap,
[6361.98 → 6363.36] I'm actually done now.
[6363.82 → 6365.76] And so I was sitting there, and I was like,
[6365.90 → 6368.44] right.
[6368.44 → 6377.96] So I bought this and I actually sucked it in my backpack before my trip thinking,
[6378.22 → 6378.52] Oh yeah,
[6378.60 → 6379.38] maybe I'll read,
[6379.56 → 6381.06] read something on paper.
[6381.28 → 6381.66] Uh,
[6381.66 → 6382.76] it's just for fun.
[6382.82 → 6384.34] The story of an accidental revolutionary.
[6384.60 → 6386.58] It's a Linus Torvald's autobiography.
[6386.80 → 6390.44] And I wanted to read it as homework before we do the collab with him.
[6390.78 → 6391.78] And so I,
[6391.78 → 6394.16] I got through about a quarter of it on the rest of my flight.
[6394.16 → 6398.36] And then I actually realized today that we have a date for when he's going to
[6398.36 → 6400.38] be coming in and I,
[6400.38 → 6402.88] I'm going to get this read.
[6403.00 → 6407.18] I am so flipping excited.
[6407.18 → 6408.32] And you're probably wondering,
[6408.68 → 6409.16] Hey Linus,
[6409.22 → 6409.78] you bought salt,
[6409.86 → 6410.02] sugar,
[6410.14 → 6410.92] fat on Kindle.
[6411.30 → 6411.74] Um,
[6411.84 → 6413.34] what's the deal with that?
[6413.48 → 6415.02] Why would you buy a physical book?
[6415.88 → 6417.96] Because I'm going to get him to sign it.
[6418.36 → 6419.20] I'm so excited.
[6419.36 → 6423.10] Did you know I'm not there?
[6423.28 → 6423.66] Uh,
[6423.66 → 6423.84] yeah,
[6423.84 → 6424.98] but we're not talking about the date.
[6426.28 → 6426.68] Okay.
[6426.90 → 6428.34] I did not know that until you,
[6428.36 → 6429.22] told me that just now,
[6429.22 → 6430.62] and I'm super sorry for you.
[6430.66 → 6434.48] I'm actually legitimately like extremely sorry for you because dude,
[6434.52 → 6435.54] I was so sad.
[6436.98 → 6440.00] I've legitimately kind of considered looking into like,
[6440.18 → 6441.86] can I find a way to be there?
[6442.44 → 6442.88] Um,
[6443.02 → 6444.88] I can't give more context other than that.
[6444.88 → 6446.10] Because we're not giving the date obviously,
[6446.28 → 6446.72] but yeah,
[6446.72 → 6448.80] I don't think I can,
[6448.88 → 6450.46] but I am,
[6450.52 → 6451.56] I am a sad boy.
[6451.56 → 6453.94] This was like probably the one time,
[6453.94 → 6455.22] but you know,
[6455.56 → 6459.12] maybe it goes super well, and we want to work together again.
[6459.20 → 6459.46] I don't know.
[6459.52 → 6459.76] We'll see.
[6460.22 → 6460.60] Um,
[6460.72 → 6461.36] I'm sorry,
[6461.48 → 6461.76] dude.
[6462.28 → 6462.70] I'm,
[6462.74 → 6464.80] I'm legitimately very sorry about that.
[6464.92 → 6465.36] You just,
[6465.44 → 6468.08] you just have to do a good enough job that it happens again.
[6468.64 → 6469.58] I'll do my best.
[6469.68 → 6470.56] NASA Mode asks,
[6470.68 → 6472.04] are you nervous Linus?
[6472.04 → 6472.44] Um,
[6472.44 → 6472.76] like,
[6473.02 → 6473.54] yes.
[6474.14 → 6474.54] I cause,
[6474.74 → 6475.34] because I've,
[6475.38 → 6477.30] I've only met the guy briefly on,
[6477.40 → 6477.88] on a call.
[6478.02 → 6479.90] He was super nice.
[6480.32 → 6480.76] Um,
[6481.18 → 6483.08] like unbelievably nice.
[6483.08 → 6486.90] The fact that he's coming here blows my mind.
[6487.34 → 6489.08] Like it's one of those things where it's like,
[6489.12 → 6489.50] it's,
[6489.58 → 6489.82] um,
[6490.64 → 6491.14] Oh man,
[6491.16 → 6491.74] how do I put this?
[6491.74 → 6492.14] There's like,
[6492.14 → 6496.22] there's kind of unspoken sort of not rules,
[6496.22 → 6499.26] but just like unspoken understandings and collabs.
[6499.64 → 6500.08] Like,
[6500.16 → 6501.30] like one party,
[6501.30 → 6502.44] you know,
[6502.88 → 6503.40] like,
[6503.54 → 6507.98] like you can have one party that's like clearly benefiting the other party,
[6508.10 → 6508.30] like,
[6508.60 → 6508.96] you know,
[6509.02 → 6509.92] lifting them up.
[6510.00 → 6510.98] And then you have,
[6511.08 → 6513.72] or you could have like a collaboration between peers,
[6513.72 → 6515.76] or you could be the party that,
[6515.90 → 6516.00] you know,
[6516.04 → 6519.62] really probably needs to kind of put in the extra work.
[6519.82 → 6520.64] Like it's,
[6520.74 → 6521.04] um,
[6522.06 → 6523.36] like if I'm like,
[6523.40 → 6523.90] if I was,
[6524.02 → 6525.62] if I was collaborating with,
[6525.80 → 6526.08] um,
[6526.16 → 6526.38] you know,
[6526.38 → 6526.66] let's,
[6526.78 → 6527.76] let's use an example,
[6528.18 → 6528.40] man,
[6528.52 → 6529.02] who's,
[6529.02 → 6532.74] how horrible is it that I'm trying to think of a non,
[6532.84 → 6536.12] a non-controversial large YouTuber and I can't,
[6537.12 → 6539.10] what does that say about our space?
[6541.74 → 6542.18] Okay.
[6543.18 → 6543.58] Um,
[6543.58 → 6550.02] PewDiePie hasn't done anything recently.
[6550.34 → 6550.70] All right.
[6550.70 → 6561.96] You're calling Statute of limitations on the bridge.
[6570.58 → 6571.02] Okay.
[6571.02 → 6572.00] We've got some suggestions.
[6572.14 → 6573.06] We've got some suggestions.
[6573.80 → 6574.32] Multiplier,
[6574.48 → 6576.00] Multiplier is one suggestion.
[6576.18 → 6576.64] Hank Green.
[6577.02 → 6577.94] Multiplier is pretty base.
[6578.04 → 6579.06] Hank Green is pretty base.
[6579.06 → 6580.04] Pretty good suggestion.
[6580.26 → 6582.46] Did Matt Pat retired with nothing,
[6582.56 → 6582.72] right?
[6582.76 → 6583.12] He retired,
[6583.12 → 6583.66] retired,
[6584.02 → 6586.32] but his channels are still going.
[6586.52 → 6586.74] Okay.
[6586.74 → 6587.66] And I think Matt Pat,
[6587.82 → 6588.60] let's use Matt Pat.
[6588.74 → 6588.94] Okay.
[6589.06 → 6591.84] The theorists are clean as far as when it's so Matt Pat,
[6592.02 → 6592.22] Matt,
[6592.22 → 6593.14] really cool people.
[6593.38 → 6597.28] Matt Pat or Hank Green invites me to do a collab.
[6597.66 → 6599.90] I am the sub in this relationship.
[6600.04 → 6601.22] I travel to them.
[6601.32 → 6602.14] I don't even ask.
[6602.52 → 6602.62] Right.
[6602.74 → 6602.96] Standard.
[6603.14 → 6603.50] Like I,
[6603.50 → 6603.78] I don't,
[6603.78 → 6605.02] I don't ask.
[6605.10 → 6605.72] I don't ask.
[6605.78 → 6606.12] Are you,
[6606.30 → 6606.64] are you,
[6606.64 → 6607.08] you know,
[6607.28 → 6609.24] can you fly to me for us to do this collab?
[6609.40 → 6611.48] Now there could be a reason that they have to come here.
[6611.62 → 6612.36] Like if we're,
[6612.44 → 6616.46] if we're building a fancy PC, and we're going to paint it, and we need our workshop and stuff,
[6616.50 → 6617.48] there could be a reason for that.
[6617.58 → 6621.32] But if the idea is just that we're going to be talking heads, and we're going to yin yak at each
[6621.32 → 6621.56] other,
[6621.72 → 6624.32] I just assume that I'm going to them.
[6624.70 → 6631.38] And in the same way that a much smaller creator would probably assume that they're coming to me with Linus,
[6631.38 → 6632.36] it was the same way.
[6632.84 → 6636.48] I assumed that I am packing up the show.
[6636.60 → 6638.12] I'm packing up all the parts.
[6638.26 → 6639.46] We're bringing it to,
[6639.58 → 6640.52] I don't know,
[6640.86 → 6641.62] his house.
[6641.84 → 6644.72] We find a studio space that we can rent.
[6644.94 → 6652.08] We are moving heaven and earth to make this thing happen because I am just grateful that he replied to a freaking email,
[6652.08 → 6659.04] let alone that he has graciously offered us like half a day to a day of his time to,
[6659.04 → 6659.42] to,
[6659.58 → 6660.64] to collaborate together.
[6660.64 → 6661.70] Like it's so exciting.
[6662.02 → 6664.08] And then he just casually drops.
[6664.20 → 6664.50] Oh no,
[6664.52 → 6665.78] I think I could just come to you.
[6666.18 → 6666.44] Yeah.
[6666.54 → 6666.76] You know,
[6666.78 → 6668.68] I travel a lot for work, and it's no biggie.
[6668.72 → 6669.64] I can just hop up there.
[6669.66 → 6670.16] And I'm like,
[6670.86 → 6672.90] how can you be this cool?
[6672.90 → 6676.58] It will like it,
[6676.74 → 6677.04] it,
[6677.34 → 6679.54] you almost like don't even want to accept it,
[6679.54 → 6682.72] but it will be a lot easier to do a collab here.
[6682.86 → 6683.24] I know.
[6683.32 → 6683.72] I know.
[6683.82 → 6683.98] But dude,
[6684.04 → 6684.38] I had,
[6684.50 → 6685.78] it's just so cool though.
[6686.72 → 6687.64] Remember that story?
[6687.72 → 6687.96] I,
[6687.96 → 6688.20] I,
[6688.20 → 6690.54] I'm going to be vague only because,
[6690.54 → 6691.38] uh,
[6691.38 → 6691.94] I don't know if you,
[6692.00 → 6694.54] you mentioned you might want to save it for content or something,
[6694.54 → 6697.50] but remember that story I told you about fixing a computer recently?
[6697.72 → 6698.12] One,
[6698.26 → 6699.84] a computer that you knew about.
[6700.82 → 6701.18] Yeah.
[6701.30 → 6701.56] Oh yeah,
[6701.56 → 6701.72] yeah,
[6701.72 → 6701.86] yeah,
[6701.86 → 6701.98] yeah,
[6701.98 → 6702.10] yeah.
[6702.10 → 6702.24] No,
[6702.28 → 6703.00] you can just tell the story.
[6704.18 → 6705.50] We can still be content.
[6705.62 → 6705.92] I don't know.
[6706.80 → 6706.98] The
[6707.04 → 6721.00] the computer Linus's team in scrapper war season four had a motherboard that they had to repair, and they repaired it in like this really weird way,
[6721.12 → 6722.18] but it worked.
[6722.30 → 6723.32] And then afterwards,
[6723.32 → 6729.22] I don't remember if it was given away to Christmas party, or I bought it, or it was just effectively tossed out.
[6729.32 → 6731.02] I don't remember what the situation was.
[6731.02 → 6731.98] It might've just been tossed.
[6732.10 → 6738.00] But I ended up with it and I gave it to my brother, and it just kept working forever.
[6738.00 → 6738.84] Which is crazy.
[6739.06 → 6741.50] Despite the craziest fix ever,
[6741.62 → 6742.78] it just kept working.
[6742.78 → 6749.78] And then it got passed to a friend of ours.
[6749.78 → 6750.44] And then it went from that friend of ours to,
[6750.44 → 6754.48] to their kid and their kid bought a new case for it.
[6754.48 → 6755.12] Um,
[6755.12 → 6757.26] which,
[6757.46 → 6758.00] you know,
[6758.06 → 6758.46] whatever,
[6758.68 → 6761.32] maybe do a different performance upgrade on a 2,500 K.
[6761.32 → 6762.22] But anyway,
[6762.36 → 6764.12] that's a topic for another time.
[6764.54 → 6764.98] Um,
[6765.30 → 6766.98] and in the case swap,
[6767.22 → 6768.68] they like removed the
[6768.68 → 6770.98] the wire that made the whole thing work.
[6770.98 → 6775.18] And it's crazy that he reached out to me to try to potentially fix it because like,
[6775.44 → 6775.62] no,
[6775.72 → 6776.82] the amount of people that would.
[6776.88 → 6777.28] No,
[6777.28 → 6777.48] wait.
[6777.82 → 6778.16] Oh yeah.
[6778.22 → 6778.38] No,
[6778.44 → 6778.86] sorry.
[6778.98 → 6779.12] Sorry.
[6779.20 → 6779.34] Yeah.
[6779.40 → 6781.20] I thought you told the story differently to me,
[6781.26 → 6781.62] but no,
[6781.66 → 6781.76] that,
[6781.92 → 6782.00] yeah,
[6782.04 → 6782.62] I think that's right.
[6782.62 → 6783.50] so he,
[6783.50 → 6787.50] he didn't like to know that this motherboard was like special.
[6787.60 → 6789.08] He didn't know it came from me,
[6789.16 → 6790.96] which really it came from you.
[6791.10 → 6792.94] And really it was modded in,
[6793.04 → 6794.24] in an episode of Scrapper Wars.
[6794.28 → 6795.80] Like he didn't know all of that.
[6795.94 → 6796.34] Uh,
[6796.34 → 6797.34] so when he brought it over,
[6797.40 → 6798.24] we were able to like,
[6798.56 → 6801.36] look at the episode of Scrapper Wars and figure out what they did.
[6801.46 → 6802.12] And then I,
[6802.14 → 6802.44] I,
[6802.52 → 6802.86] you know,
[6802.86 → 6804.90] move the little cable over, and it started working,
[6804.98 → 6805.78] which was fantastic.
[6806.40 → 6806.88] Um,
[6807.38 → 6808.78] and,
[6808.94 → 6809.56] and yeah,
[6809.56 → 6810.08] that was,
[6810.32 → 6810.52] um,
[6811.32 → 6812.54] why does this story matter?
[6812.62 → 6813.22] Oh yeah.
[6813.62 → 6813.94] I,
[6814.12 → 6814.24] when,
[6814.32 → 6815.70] when we went to go fix a computer,
[6815.70 → 6817.12] I asked him to come to the office.
[6818.24 → 6819.48] Like we fixed it at the office.
[6819.56 → 6820.58] Because I was thinking in my head,
[6820.60 → 6820.92] I was like,
[6820.92 → 6826.22] where am I going to have the most like tools and potentially spare parts to
[6826.22 → 6828.10] like try if something is,
[6828.10 → 6828.76] is wrong?
[6828.76 → 6829.00] Like,
[6829.04 → 6829.18] Oh,
[6829.18 → 6829.40] okay.
[6829.40 → 6830.42] Maybe it's the GPU.
[6830.54 → 6831.26] Let's swap the GPU,
[6831.38 → 6831.64] whatever.
[6831.74 → 6834.74] Like where is going to be most convenient to do this?
[6834.82 → 6835.70] And it was like,
[6835.82 → 6837.94] I don't know it room at the office.
[6838.52 → 6840.84] And then we went there, and it was just perfect.
[6841.20 → 6841.74] It was like,
[6841.74 → 6841.90] yeah,
[6841.90 → 6842.16] okay,
[6842.16 → 6842.44] cool.
[6842.62 → 6843.28] So it is,
[6843.28 → 6843.80] you know,
[6843.80 → 6845.34] way more convenient for him to come here.
[6845.44 → 6847.60] Everything is set up for what you guys are going to have to do.
[6847.72 → 6850.88] It also means we don't have to worry about any privacy stuff like at his
[6850.88 → 6851.10] house.
[6851.20 → 6854.54] The last thing I would want to do is like docs Linus Torvalds.
[6855.78 → 6857.56] Or do like crazy blurring,
[6857.56 → 6860.10] which ends up making the video tar to watch or whatever else.
[6860.10 → 6860.34] Like,
[6860.78 → 6860.98] yeah.
[6861.02 → 6861.42] So it's,
[6861.48 → 6863.08] it is sweet that he's coming over.
[6863.64 → 6864.00] Um,
[6864.00 → 6865.42] it's just also surprisingly,
[6865.42 → 6865.86] like you said,
[6866.06 → 6867.22] it's a really long story for that.
[6867.22 → 6867.78] But anyway,
[6867.78 → 6868.74] I think it's cool.
[6868.88 → 6870.34] I can't believe that computer still works.
[6871.34 → 6872.10] It's crazy.
[6872.10 → 6874.20] I still don't understand why it works.
[6874.20 → 6874.60] I,
[6874.70 → 6878.20] I want to do a collab with like build Void or something where,
[6879.20 → 6879.44] yeah,
[6879.74 → 6881.10] I want to try with him anyway,
[6881.24 → 6881.58] but yeah,
[6881.64 → 6882.46] we're just like,
[6882.46 → 6889.62] can you please enlighten my stupid monkey brain as to why plugging in this fan
[6889.62 → 6892.54] header makes this busted motherboard work.
[6892.88 → 6892.98] So,
[6892.98 → 6893.20] uh,
[6893.20 → 6894.36] it's not just plugging the fan.
[6894.42 → 6896.24] It's like bridging two different.
[6896.62 → 6900.58] So Pancreas's is in the flow plane chat saying,
[6900.68 → 6903.44] cause the part where we like fixed it is,
[6903.52 → 6905.24] was cut from the episode by accident.
[6905.36 → 6909.28] So the whole saga is something that nobody's ever actually seen.
[6909.28 → 6913.98] But as part of the compilation of the fourth scrapyard wars,
[6914.12 → 6914.74] uh,
[6914.78 → 6918.20] Pancreas's has gone through the footage, and he says it should be included in the
[6918.20 → 6918.66] compilation.
[6918.88 → 6919.26] So the like,
[6919.46 → 6920.12] no way,
[6920.42 → 6921.98] because I knew it was on camera.
[6922.18 → 6923.02] I knew it was shot,
[6923.36 → 6924.32] but remember I didn't,
[6924.44 → 6925.92] I didn't review the videos before.
[6926.40 → 6929.62] I just like assumed the editors would get everything.
[6929.62 → 6930.00] And that,
[6930.04 → 6930.26] that's,
[6930.34 → 6931.32] that's not always fair.
[6931.62 → 6931.94] Uh,
[6931.94 → 6932.60] but it wasn't,
[6932.68 → 6933.50] it wasn't in the video.
[6934.06 → 6937.84] And so there was just this weird like bridged wire, and we were like talking
[6937.84 → 6938.94] about it in the conclusion.
[6939.28 → 6940.28] but yeah,
[6940.28 → 6946.12] people never actually saw that wildness happen where I'm pretty sure there
[6946.12 → 6946.94] were like sparks.
[6947.68 → 6948.46] Like there was,
[6948.56 → 6949.26] there was fire.
[6949.38 → 6950.76] That motherboard was burned.
[6951.32 → 6951.68] And I see,
[6951.80 → 6951.90] I,
[6952.02 → 6955.08] I only know that portion from hearing it from you because I,
[6955.08 → 6955.84] I didn't see it.
[6955.84 → 6956.04] And,
[6956.08 → 6958.72] and we scrubbed the video to try to find the wire,
[6958.72 → 6959.92] which we could do,
[6960.02 → 6963.38] but it w it was hard to find like that point of the episode.
[6963.52 → 6964.50] We struggled to kind of find it.
[6964.54 → 6965.30] Because it wasn't there.
[6965.56 → 6966.08] The footage isn't there.
[6966.20 → 6966.44] Yeah.
[6966.44 → 6966.88] Yeah.
[6968.30 → 6968.66] Yeah.
[6969.10 → 6969.90] It's a
[6969.98 → 6970.70] what a thing.
[6970.80 → 6971.12] So yeah,
[6971.18 → 6971.68] I mean,
[6971.68 → 6972.74] I'm stoked it exists.
[6972.74 → 6974.10] And if we end up doing that,
[6974.28 → 6974.98] that collab,
[6975.10 → 6977.12] I'm sure I can get the computer back at least,
[6977.42 → 6978.24] at least temporarily.
[6978.76 → 6979.42] That'd be cool.
[6979.92 → 6980.56] That'd be fun.
[6980.56 → 6981.90] Hey,
[6982.38 → 6983.12] want some cool news?
[6983.84 → 6984.14] Yes.
[6984.22 → 6989.36] SpaceX is cellular star link now works on Apple watches in Canada and Japan.
[6990.14 → 6991.22] I just think that's cool.
[6991.58 → 6992.14] That's all.
[6992.20 → 6992.56] Okay.
[6992.80 → 6993.20] Sweet.
[6993.34 → 6993.50] Yeah.
[6993.50 → 6997.16] Only text message sending and receiving via Apple Watch messages app is supported.
[6997.54 → 6999.04] Rogers in Canada is supporting it.
[6999.10 → 7001.20] FDDI in Japan is supporting it on,
[7001.38 → 7003.30] I think this is on three Apple Watch models.
[7003.88 → 7004.14] Um,
[7004.14 → 7005.88] SpaceX is partner in the USA.
[7006.00 → 7006.96] T-Mobile could be next.
[7006.96 → 7008.18] No confirmation at this time,
[7008.24 → 7009.06] but I just think,
[7009.14 → 7010.80] I think that's a super cool feature,
[7010.94 → 7013.10] especially in an emergency or whatever else.
[7013.10 → 7013.66] It's a
[7014.02 → 7014.78] it's a
[7015.02 → 7016.42] I don't know.
[7016.46 → 7019.94] I don't know if I want to say underrated feature of some of Apple's hardware,
[7019.94 → 7025.96] but having something like that on your watch seems even better than having it on your phone.
[7025.96 → 7027.96] If you're ever in an emergency situation.
[7028.80 → 7029.40] Very cool.
[7029.60 → 7029.98] So that,
[7029.98 → 7030.44] that was it.
[7030.52 → 7031.64] That was all I had to say about that.
[7032.98 → 7033.38] Okay.
[7033.38 → 7033.82] Uh,
[7035.98 → 7036.90] what else do we have?
[7038.16 → 7038.46] Oh,
[7038.54 → 7042.36] should we talk about the stop killing games petition getting debated in UK parliament?
[7043.20 → 7043.58] Yeah.
[7044.58 → 7055.20] The stop killing games campaign finally reached the floor of the UK parliament where members debated its petition urging publishers to stop rendering games unplayable when companies choose to shut down their servers.
[7055.20 → 7066.32] Notably MP Mark Seward's contended that companies might already be violating consumer production laws by failing to clearly disclose how long players will have access to a game.
[7066.32 → 7066.72] Nice.
[7066.88 → 7071.36] Seward's also got in a sick burn by mentioning that,
[7071.36 → 7072.36] uh,
[7072.36 → 7084.74] the dead game lawbreakers would probably have been popular amongst some of games industry people.
[7086.10 → 7086.60] Helping.
[7087.10 → 7087.88] Thanks Linus.
[7087.88 → 7090.04] There was a sentence fragment there.
[7090.04 → 7092.04] Uh,
[7092.20 → 7093.34] the government's,
[7093.34 → 7096.34] but nobody understands what just happened other than you and me.
[7096.34 → 7096.74] Uh,
[7096.74 → 7104.00] the government spokesperson re restated that there are no current intentions to amend the law,
[7104.00 → 7109.02] but emphasized that businesses must provide consumers with adequate information about their products.
[7109.42 → 7119.90] There is still optimism for the EU branch of stop killing games campaign as it is in the process of preparing and waiting for EU politicians to debate its citizens initiative on the issue.
[7119.90 → 7120.78] This is pretty cool.
[7120.78 → 7121.12] I,
[7121.12 → 7121.50] uh,
[7121.50 → 7122.36] I have to admit,
[7122.50 → 7124.94] I really didn't have a lot of hope for it,
[7124.94 → 7127.12] but I certainly have a lot of,
[7127.12 → 7128.20] um,
[7128.80 → 7130.88] agreement with the
[7131.02 → 7132.14] with the premise of,
[7132.44 → 7132.58] hey,
[7132.70 → 7132.98] you know,
[7133.04 → 7133.82] when you buy something,
[7133.96 → 7134.20] you should,
[7134.30 → 7134.48] yeah.
[7134.62 → 7136.66] And if this happens for games,
[7136.66 → 7145.16] I really think at that point we're a stone's throw from software, and then we're a stone's throw from other media.
[7146.24 → 7146.46] And so,
[7146.58 → 7146.78] hardware.
[7147.42 → 7147.98] Exactly.
[7147.98 → 7150.28] This whole trend of like,
[7151.56 → 7156.78] you will buy things, and then you don't own them and someone can just shut them down.
[7157.46 → 7157.98] It,
[7158.08 → 7159.48] it needs to end.
[7159.70 → 7164.44] And it's not going to end just by hoping that our corporate overlords are going to stop doing it.
[7164.70 → 7167.96] It's only going to end if it's legislated.
[7169.22 → 7169.74] So,
[7170.24 → 7172.02] not a lot to add here.
[7172.08 → 7175.82] Just wanted to let you guys know that all is not yet lost.
[7175.82 → 7176.80] Um,
[7178.56 → 7182.46] marktxtep69 in float plane chat says,
[7182.52 → 7182.60] hey,
[7182.62 → 7185.24] have you seen the new Red Magic 11 with active water cooling?
[7186.68 → 7187.08] No,
[7187.54 → 7191.74] but I greenlet today doing a sponsored video on it.
[7191.82 → 7192.08] So,
[7192.16 → 7194.28] I will see it, and I'm actually legitimately,
[7194.74 → 7195.48] sponsorship aside,
[7195.88 → 7196.46] full disclosure,
[7197.02 → 7198.18] but sponsorship aside,
[7198.74 → 7199.94] it looks pretty cool.
[7199.94 → 7200.88] Do you want a spoiler?
[7201.74 → 7202.06] Uh,
[7202.12 → 7202.52] yes.
[7203.00 → 7204.12] It has a headphone jack.
[7204.62 → 7205.10] No.
[7205.36 → 7205.78] Oh.
[7206.30 → 7206.44] I'm,
[7206.56 → 7208.82] and no hole punch in the screen.
[7208.96 → 7209.80] I am actually.
[7209.94 → 7210.20] What?
[7210.42 → 7211.90] Considering it because.
[7212.04 → 7212.66] Are you holding it?
[7212.76 → 7213.04] Nope.
[7213.26 → 7213.48] Oh.
[7214.28 → 7214.58] Sony,
[7214.98 → 7215.62] no hole punch.
[7216.12 → 7216.60] Very,
[7216.94 → 7218.42] very uncommon.
[7218.54 → 7221.56] There's like no phones that are not doing the hole punch.
[7221.88 → 7223.24] Under screen camera.
[7223.84 → 7224.12] Uh,
[7224.12 → 7225.04] headphone jack.
[7225.60 → 7226.04] Uh,
[7226.60 → 7230.16] I'm thinking about it even though I don't gamer on the phone.
[7230.16 → 7230.66] What is this?
[7230.76 → 7232.12] Red Magic 11 Pro?
[7232.24 → 7232.72] Is that what you said?
[7232.76 → 7233.68] I think that's the one.
[7233.76 → 7233.90] Yeah.
[7234.00 → 7234.34] Because I,
[7234.58 → 7235.14] no camera bump.
[7235.16 → 7235.90] Anyone who hasn't noticed.
[7236.00 → 7236.84] Oh my God.
[7237.28 → 7237.78] I'm on,
[7237.92 → 7239.70] I'm on wired headphones right now.
[7240.06 → 7240.20] They,
[7240.26 → 7242.24] they have not lost their place in my heart.
[7242.36 → 7243.14] I like wired headphones.
[7243.14 → 7243.34] Yeah.
[7243.46 → 7245.24] I still really like wired headphones.
[7245.44 → 7245.60] Yeah.
[7245.64 → 7246.40] I would love a fun.
[7246.52 → 7250.16] I've been planning on going Sony because Dan kind of talked me into it for,
[7250.34 → 7251.74] for the next generation that I go to.
[7251.92 → 7253.62] If I upgrade this one,
[7253.70 → 7255.76] you can have my old one, and then you won't have to buy anything.
[7256.70 → 7257.06] Oh,
[7257.22 → 7257.96] like to that.
[7258.36 → 7259.82] That does itch my brain.
[7261.66 → 7262.56] So be careful.
[7262.62 → 7263.48] We'll see.
[7263.56 → 7264.56] I've been pondering it.
[7264.66 → 7266.16] I've been pondering it.
[7266.16 → 7266.48] Uh,
[7266.48 → 7266.90] dude,
[7267.28 → 7267.66] I've man,
[7267.74 → 7267.88] the
[7267.88 → 7268.36] the whole,
[7268.36 → 7269.28] whole punch thing.
[7269.44 → 7273.00] Like I kind of thought I was over it because I've been using the pixel nine a
[7273.00 → 7274.70] and I kind of mostly got over it,
[7274.72 → 7277.70] but I've been on the iPhone air more recently.
[7277.96 → 7278.36] And,
[7278.48 → 7278.82] um,
[7279.94 → 7280.22] I,
[7280.38 → 7280.82] uh,
[7281.14 → 7281.60] I find,
[7281.68 → 7281.82] Oh,
[7282.00 → 7282.34] Dan,
[7282.36 → 7282.80] I've talked to,
[7282.86 → 7284.24] I've talked to you about this and Luke,
[7284.30 → 7284.54] I've,
[7284.54 → 7285.78] I'm kind of doing a thing where I,
[7285.84 → 7287.44] I'm like watching iconic movies.
[7287.72 → 7288.12] Okay.
[7288.12 → 7290.70] I'm finally making my way through like my movie backlog.
[7290.86 → 7292.60] So I finally watched all the president's men.
[7293.16 → 7293.52] Um,
[7294.00 → 7296.44] very different pacing compared to a more modern film.
[7296.44 → 7296.86] Have you seen it,
[7296.96 → 7297.00] Dan?
[7297.42 → 7298.08] I don't think so.
[7298.46 → 7298.62] Oh,
[7298.70 → 7298.88] okay.
[7299.22 → 7299.54] Uh,
[7299.58 → 7300.58] very different pacing.
[7300.72 → 7302.76] It's from 1976 or something like that.
[7303.00 → 7303.48] It's,
[7303.54 → 7303.88] it's,
[7303.96 → 7304.28] it's,
[7304.28 → 7304.32] it's,
[7304.32 → 7304.60] uh,
[7304.76 → 7305.62] it's no,
[7305.70 → 7305.98] I have not.
[7306.20 → 7307.12] It's so good.
[7307.34 → 7307.66] Um,
[7307.66 → 7308.86] it's on the Watergate scandal.
[7309.54 → 7313.54] And that was the other thing that stood out to me is what qualified as
[7313.54 → 7314.84] shocking,
[7315.72 → 7321.26] scandalous behaviour back then that could like to undo a presidency.
[7322.98 → 7323.46] Man,
[7323.56 → 7326.86] they ain't had seen nothing yet by that point.
[7326.94 → 7327.20] Anyway,
[7327.40 → 7332.62] the point is not that the point is that with the bigger face ID,
[7332.62 → 7333.74] freaking camera,
[7333.74 → 7334.86] camera,
[7335.10 → 7336.14] bullet hole,
[7336.26 → 7338.94] exit wound that Apple has on their displays,
[7339.18 → 7341.08] full screen content,
[7341.16 → 7341.26] man,
[7341.34 → 7342.64] it is still distracting.
[7343.04 → 7347.40] And I've even been using a phone that has a hole punch for quite a while now.
[7347.58 → 7348.06] Like,
[7348.14 → 7348.50] can we,
[7348.62 → 7349.76] can be just not,
[7350.74 → 7351.96] can we not get over this?
[7352.02 → 7354.98] Can we demand screens that don't have a flipping hole in them?
[7355.30 → 7355.84] It's hard.
[7356.18 → 7356.72] It's hard.
[7356.72 → 7359.20] And for a while people were trying to solve it.
[7359.26 → 7362.98] Like we had ones that had little mechanical flip up rear cameras.
[7363.14 → 7366.20] OnePlus had that one that retracted into the body.
[7366.62 → 7366.82] Uh,
[7366.82 → 7369.38] the under screen ones were a thing for a while,
[7369.46 → 7370.84] but that's what the red magic has,
[7370.92 → 7371.12] right?
[7371.24 → 7375.28] People use their selfie cameras so much that I also can like kind of understand.
[7375.58 → 7375.84] But I mean,
[7375.92 → 7376.78] Sony just like,
[7376.90 → 7378.96] because you've got the earpiece right at the top.
[7378.96 → 7379.22] Yeah.
[7379.28 → 7379.50] Right.
[7379.60 → 7380.64] There's just a little tiny,
[7381.00 → 7382.42] just a little tiny camera right there.
[7382.48 → 7382.92] And it's fine.
[7382.92 → 7385.44] I mean,
[7385.54 → 7386.70] Samsung did it on the note night,
[7386.80 → 7386.92] dude.
[7387.30 → 7391.80] If Samsung released the Galaxy Note nine Eve,
[7392.02 → 7395.28] I would be first in line to buy it.
[7395.74 → 7396.18] Headphone,
[7396.24 → 7396.54] Jack,
[7396.70 → 7397.52] SD card,
[7397.88 → 7398.62] a SIM slot,
[7398.78 → 7399.16] e-sim.
[7399.34 → 7400.32] So that gets you your two,
[7400.42 → 7401.30] your two Sims,
[7401.76 → 7403.34] no hole punch,
[7403.42 → 7405.16] just like a skinny top bar.
[7405.26 → 7405.88] And like,
[7405.94 → 7406.12] man,
[7406.16 → 7407.88] that form factor was so sleek.
[7408.16 → 7411.18] I pick it up every once in a while because it's the phone that I use for line
[7411.18 → 7412.44] messenger because I just,
[7412.44 → 7416.40] have never figured out how to migrate my line messenger messages.
[7417.02 → 7421.48] So it's just the phone that I take with me to Taipei every time I go for all my badminton friends.
[7421.62 → 7424.10] But so every once in a while I pick it up, and I'm like,
[7424.78 → 7425.10] damn,
[7425.78 → 7427.58] it still feels so good in the hand.
[7427.58 → 7430.02] Cause even though it's not as thin as like an iPhone air,
[7430.10 → 7431.16] it tapers at the edges.
[7431.16 → 7432.56] So it like feels super thin.
[7432.90 → 7433.84] Freaking love it.
[7433.84 → 7435.10] I just like this one.
[7435.12 → 7435.92] Because it's a big phone,
[7436.08 → 7437.14] but it's a thin phone.
[7437.32 → 7439.04] So it's like having a small phone,
[7439.18 → 7440.46] but with more up and down,
[7440.56 → 7441.34] which is really nice.
[7441.34 → 7442.74] They are,
[7443.00 → 7444.00] I don't know.
[7444.06 → 7445.76] Phones these days are just getting really wide.
[7446.30 → 7447.38] Dyslexic stoner says,
[7447.46 → 7452.34] welcome back to another hour of three old men complaining about how good phones used to be,
[7452.38 → 7453.80] but they did.
[7454.00 → 7457.58] I had that sexy LG one with the power button right in the middle of the back.
[7457.58 → 7459.56] I can't remember what that was called.
[7460.16 → 7460.48] Oh,
[7460.56 → 7461.38] I remember that.
[7461.48 → 7462.66] That was so good.
[7462.68 → 7463.46] It was so good.
[7463.64 → 7464.58] There was one,
[7464.86 → 7466.16] it was a merch message earlier.
[7466.58 → 7469.78] What phone would you keep in the Samsung 8 edge?
[7470.04 → 7472.46] I really liked for a very long time.
[7472.58 → 7472.84] Oh yeah.
[7473.12 → 7474.84] I had Superman ROM on that.
[7474.92 → 7475.74] That was sick.
[7476.86 → 7478.08] Dennis in full plane shot said,
[7478.14 → 7479.08] LG G2.
[7479.56 → 7480.68] LG G2 was dope.
[7480.68 → 7482.48] Samsung S3 was dope.
[7483.66 → 7484.14] Um,
[7484.22 → 7484.68] the like original,
[7486.76 → 7490.38] basically all the Nexus phones were sick.
[7490.88 → 7493.48] I loved Samsung's active lineup.
[7493.68 → 7497.54] I was like the only person in the entire ecosphere,
[7497.78 → 7498.74] as far as I could tell,
[7499.08 → 7502.96] who was like super into Samsung's active phones.
[7502.96 → 7504.96] They were a galaxy S whatever,
[7505.18 → 7510.92] but just like gigantic Chung us battery and like rugged.
[7510.94 → 7511.48] Sounds awesome.
[7511.76 → 7512.74] They were freaking awesome,
[7512.88 → 7514.14] but not so thick.
[7514.28 → 7517.72] Like it was still thinner than having a case on your other phone,
[7517.78 → 7520.32] but you just didn't need a case, and you had a bigger battery.
[7520.40 → 7520.62] I was like,
[7520.64 → 7521.16] this is brilliant.
[7521.24 → 7522.44] Why doesn't everybody just buy this?
[7523.10 → 7523.22] Yeah.
[7523.30 → 7523.48] Yeah.
[7524.38 → 7524.82] Oh,
[7524.94 → 7525.70] loved those.
[7528.76 → 7529.20] Um,
[7529.32 → 7529.78] all right.
[7529.80 → 7530.16] What are we,
[7530.24 → 7531.24] what are we supposed to be talking about?
[7532.96 → 7533.40] Oh,
[7533.44 → 7534.24] you want to do some more topics?
[7534.36 → 7534.48] Yeah,
[7534.50 → 7535.02] we can do that.
[7535.58 → 7535.88] Uh,
[7535.90 → 7537.30] there are no notes for this really,
[7537.52 → 7538.76] but just wanted to let you guys know,
[7538.82 → 7543.18] Microsoft fixes the update and shutdown bug that has plagued windows for 10 years.
[7544.04 → 7544.44] Um,
[7545.10 → 7545.38] well,
[7545.60 → 7546.16] there it goes.
[7548.22 → 7549.60] So that's exciting.
[7550.28 → 7551.18] It used to restart,
[7551.38 → 7553.08] even though you told it update and shut down,
[7553.12 → 7553.88] it would just restart.
[7554.10 → 7554.54] And yeah,
[7554.80 → 7555.00] yeah,
[7555.04 → 7555.32] a decade,
[7555.42 → 7555.68] but now,
[7555.76 → 7556.32] now it's fixed.
[7556.46 → 7557.88] I think it's coming in the next,
[7557.98 → 7558.14] uh,
[7558.14 → 7559.10] in the next Windows update.
[7559.32 → 7560.42] Our discussion question.
[7560.42 → 7562.08] That is very annoying when it does that.
[7562.08 → 7564.56] Our discussion question is what's the next windows bug that,
[7564.62 → 7564.82] uh,
[7564.82 → 7565.44] you want fixed?
[7567.86 → 7568.30] Um,
[7568.78 → 7570.64] I think most of it's not bugs.
[7570.80 → 7575.18] I think most of it is entirely intentional from their team and makes windows incredibly
[7575.18 → 7576.06] insufferable to use.
[7576.44 → 7576.78] Okay.
[7576.84 → 7577.00] Well,
[7577.06 → 7577.78] David had one.
[7578.10 → 7578.54] He says,
[7578.54 → 7579.60] I'm not sure if it's a bug,
[7579.90 → 7582.48] but it used to be like this in like XP or seven or something.
[7582.56 → 7583.14] I don't remember,
[7583.28 → 7587.72] but right-clicking a folder or item in an Explorer window does not select the item,
[7588.02 → 7588.86] even if it's highlighted.
[7589.08 → 7592.82] So you have to left-click the item to select it and then right click it to open properties,
[7592.96 → 7593.26] et cetera.
[7593.36 → 7595.24] If you right-click on another one that isn't selected,
[7595.58 → 7597.78] it deselects the first one and opens the menu for the folder.
[7598.20 → 7601.78] This behaviour does not happen in the left-hand detail pane and works as expected.
[7602.32 → 7605.08] This kind of sounds like that issue that I have with macOS,
[7605.34 → 7607.22] where if something is not the focus window,
[7607.34 → 7608.38] I can't interact with it.
[7608.40 → 7609.76] I have to click twice.
[7610.04 → 7613.00] And it seems like David and I are the sorts of people that.
[7613.50 → 7614.74] One was for me, actually.
[7614.86 → 7614.98] Oh,
[7615.00 → 7615.74] that one was from you.
[7615.82 → 7616.02] Yeah.
[7616.28 → 7616.50] Oh,
[7616.54 → 7617.18] it was his topic.
[7617.26 → 7617.98] So I assumed it was you.
[7618.06 → 7618.18] Okay.
[7618.18 → 7619.70] That's a Daniel Lesser contribution.
[7619.90 → 7621.72] I assumed that he typed his own initials there.
[7621.80 → 7622.14] My bad.
[7622.56 → 7622.72] Oh,
[7622.74 → 7622.90] good.
[7623.42 → 7623.54] No,
[7623.60 → 7624.10] David's a writer.
[7624.18 → 7624.58] He's a
[7624.58 → 7625.00] he's perfect.
[7625.32 → 7625.60] Also,
[7625.60 → 7627.60] I just noticed that your initials are a sad face.
[7628.46 → 7629.12] It tracks.
[7630.16 → 7631.14] Oh my goodness.
[7631.78 → 7636.74] All right.
[7637.40 → 7643.98] Microsoft says it doesn't have enough energy to power its current AI chips slash GPU stock.
[7644.82 → 7650.88] In an interview conducted alongside OpenAI's Sam Altman on the BG2 podcast,
[7651.34 → 7653.22] Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said,
[7653.22 → 7658.02] the biggest issue the AI industry has is not having,
[7658.66 → 7658.90] uh,
[7659.28 → 7660.60] having is not a complete,
[7660.70 → 7660.88] what?
[7661.26 → 7661.62] Okay.
[7662.28 → 7663.20] Is now having,
[7663.28 → 7663.44] oh,
[7663.50 → 7667.28] is the biggest issue the AI industry is now having is not a complete glut,
[7667.38 → 7668.16] but it's power.
[7668.50 → 7671.98] We may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can't plug in.
[7672.16 → 7672.68] In fact,
[7672.68 → 7673.80] that is my problem today.
[7673.80 → 7675.44] It is not a supply issue of chips.
[7675.54 → 7678.52] It is actually the fact that I don't have warm shells to plug into.
[7678.52 → 7679.56] I love the
[7679.74 → 7680.78] we may have this issue.
[7680.92 → 7681.28] In fact,
[7681.32 → 7682.30] we do have this issue.
[7683.80 → 7687.22] This comes after reports of consumer electricity bills,
[7687.32 → 7692.18] increasing up to 36% in cost due to growing data centre demands.
[7693.04 → 7697.52] OpenAI is calling for the U S government to build an additional 100 gigawatts of power generation
[7697.52 → 7698.04] annually.
[7698.04 → 7705.30] And at least four big AI tech companies are considering building or funding their own nuclear power facilities.
[7706.50 → 7706.92] Yeah.
[7706.94 → 7709.02] They're doing small ones though.
[7709.10 → 7709.28] They're,
[7709.28 → 7709.92] they're using,
[7710.22 → 7710.80] uh,
[7710.94 → 7711.40] Oh man,
[7711.40 → 7712.42] those little modular ones,
[7712.46 → 7712.68] right?
[7713.10 → 7713.52] Yeah.
[7713.64 → 7713.88] They're,
[7713.88 → 7716.92] they're like inspired by submarine tech or something.
[7717.10 → 7717.62] I don't,
[7717.72 → 7718.62] we don't have the details here.
[7718.62 → 7718.78] They just expire.
[7718.96 → 7720.54] They just like expire when they're done,
[7720.58 → 7720.78] right?
[7721.62 → 7723.34] Like you can't refuel them or something.
[7723.58 → 7723.68] I,
[7723.68 → 7725.90] I don't know enough details about it.
[7725.96 → 7726.30] It was,
[7726.30 → 7728.08] it's a while ago that I read about it.
[7728.08 → 7731.30] I think I probably read like the same article you did like a while back,
[7731.32 → 7733.38] like they're in containers or something like that.
[7733.50 → 7733.82] Yeah.
[7734.02 → 7734.40] So yeah,
[7734.42 → 7735.24] you just bring them in,
[7735.26 → 7737.02] you plunk them down and then they just,
[7737.10 → 7739.14] they consume all the fuel and when they're done,
[7739.18 → 7739.42] they're done.
[7739.42 → 7743.00] They're kind of like the alkaline battery of a data centre kind of thing.
[7744.84 → 7747.42] Modular reactors and shipping containers says master.
[7750.34 → 7751.98] Cats is talking about molten salt.
[7752.08 → 7752.46] Oh dude,
[7752.64 → 7755.76] did you see the Chinese shipping containers ship?
[7756.30 → 7757.38] The kid,
[7757.44 → 7759.32] the shipping container ship,
[7759.46 → 7760.46] whatever container ship,
[7760.46 → 7765.66] the Chinese container ship that uses a molten salt nuclear reactor.
[7766.34 → 7766.78] No.
[7767.00 → 7767.34] Yeah.
[7767.46 → 7767.96] Right.
[7768.82 → 7769.34] Dude.
[7769.68 → 7770.56] My goodness.
[7770.94 → 7772.06] Damn China.
[7775.86 → 7777.24] Is that the new damn Daniel?
[7778.28 → 7779.12] Damn China.
[7779.34 → 7779.90] Here we go.
[7780.42 → 7781.00] That's good.
[7781.14 → 7784.52] I think I first saw this again with a molten salt thorium reactors.
[7784.52 → 7785.12] So China.
[7786.38 → 7787.10] Thorium reactors,
[7787.24 → 7787.44] dude.
[7788.54 → 7789.42] Maybe they're not thorium.
[7789.46 → 7789.66] Yeah.
[7789.80 → 7793.88] China unveils power of thorium reactor for world's largest cargo ship.
[7793.88 → 7794.82] Look at this thing.
[7795.42 → 7798.08] Look at how many shipping containers that is.
[7798.56 → 7799.72] I want a thorium reactor.
[7799.72 → 7800.52] Just like personally.
[7800.86 → 7801.08] Yeah.
[7801.08 → 7802.08] Yeah.
[7803.08 → 7805.84] They don't let you put an AC unit in your apartment,
[7806.02 → 7807.20] but maybe a thorium reactor.
[7807.76 → 7808.50] They might.
[7808.66 → 7810.10] They might not have rules against it.
[7810.50 → 7811.48] It's not in the rider.
[7813.80 → 7817.08] Where does it say that I can't take thorium reactors in my back?
[7817.46 → 7818.16] In my bag?
[7819.42 → 7820.78] Our discussion question.
[7822.24 → 7823.46] It doesn't have batteries.
[7823.46 → 7829.12] Our discussion question is,
[7829.18 → 7832.76] how much compute do you guys think is currently sitting idle due to a lack of power?
[7832.90 → 7833.06] Okay.
[7833.08 → 7837.62] We have no way of knowing that because first there may be some sitting idle and then there
[7837.62 → 7838.28] definitely is.
[7838.34 → 7838.72] So we have,
[7838.90 → 7839.00] yeah,
[7839.00 → 7840.24] we're not going to get an answer on that.
[7840.24 → 7841.66] But our second question is,
[7842.06 → 7848.28] do you think the price of GPUs would go down if this idle inventory was available to consumers?
[7848.46 → 7850.10] Which I don't know the answer to either.
[7850.24 → 7861.30] But what I do know is that it's time for our weekly check to see if you can buy an ARC B580 for MSRP.
[7861.62 → 7862.64] One of these days,
[7862.64 → 7868.22] I am going to figure out our affiliate program for New egg.
[7868.24 → 7868.90] I don't believe you.
[7869.16 → 7869.68] I will.
[7869.84 → 7870.22] I will.
[7870.36 → 7872.00] And we're going to make some money on this segment,
[7872.16 → 7874.38] but it doesn't matter because the point for now is that,
[7874.48 → 7874.66] yes,
[7874.70 → 7875.10] in fact,
[7875.16 → 7875.60] you can.
[7876.32 → 7878.94] What does Black Friday price protection mean?
[7879.02 → 7881.54] This was $249 the last time we looked at it.
[7882.06 → 7882.24] Oh,
[7882.30 → 7884.44] but there's an Intel holiday bundle with purchase.
[7884.66 → 7885.30] Limited offer.
[7886.12 → 7886.74] Hold on a second.
[7886.82 → 7887.22] What is it?
[7887.28 → 7888.38] Hopefully it's not 3D Mark.
[7888.54 → 7889.30] Holiday bundle.
[7890.10 → 7891.06] Battlefield 6.
[7891.06 → 7891.28] Wait,
[7891.28 → 7892.94] pick one of four games.
[7893.86 → 7895.04] Battlefield 6,
[7895.54 → 7896.74] Dying Light the Beast,
[7896.92 → 7897.94] Assassin's Creed Shadows,
[7898.26 → 7899.20] and Civ 7.
[7899.84 → 7900.64] That's fantastic.
[7900.88 → 7905.42] You get one of those games with your qualifying purchase,
[7905.84 → 7906.42] plus,
[7906.50 → 7908.18] and this is until January 31st.
[7908.28 → 7908.70] Damn.
[7909.26 → 7909.92] So you pick one of these,
[7910.00 → 7910.88] plus bonus content,
[7911.12 → 7912.46] Marvel Rivals in-game content,
[7912.58 → 7912.94] who cares?
[7912.94 → 7914.20] XSplit Premium Suite.
[7914.32 → 7914.54] Okay,
[7914.60 → 7915.02] that's kind of cool.
[7915.16 → 7915.50] Candid,
[7915.82 → 7918.98] and Vegas Pro Edit 365.
[7920.12 → 7920.68] That's right,
[7920.72 → 7921.18] my friends.
[7921.36 → 7926.68] You can get all of this GPU and more for $249.99.
[7928.46 → 7930.20] If you were going to buy one of those games,
[7930.24 → 7931.98] it's basically $200 or less.
[7932.42 → 7934.38] Do they still have that feature where I can,
[7934.54 → 7936.42] where I can see how many people have it in their cart?
[7936.42 → 7939.78] I think you have to go to your cart,
[7939.90 → 7940.16] but yeah,
[7940.20 → 7940.66] I think so.
[7940.90 → 7942.50] I didn't have to do this before.
[7943.46 → 7944.08] Hold on.
[7944.24 → 7944.44] Cart?
[7944.88 → 7945.22] Am I allowed?
[7946.50 → 7947.14] Because I'm,
[7947.30 → 7947.46] oh,
[7947.58 → 7950.36] 350 plus people have this in their cart right now.
[7950.42 → 7950.60] Yeah.
[7950.60 → 7954.26] It's a great card for the price.
[7954.30 → 7956.18] We absolutely love the Arc B580.
[7956.42 → 7956.52] Oh,
[7956.52 → 7958.02] leg.GG slash Newer.
[7959.40 → 7959.64] Oh,
[7959.72 → 7959.96] okay.
[7960.56 → 7961.22] It's not easy?
[7961.52 → 7962.10] Who posted that?
[7962.12 → 7962.72] Tim and chat.
[7962.90 → 7964.06] Tim and chat posted it.
[7964.42 → 7964.60] Oh,
[7964.64 → 7965.10] that's hilarious.
[7966.46 → 7966.90] Okay.
[7967.30 → 7968.08] Tim says,
[7968.18 → 7969.32] Linus won't read this,
[7969.44 → 7970.66] but it's on the screen.
[7971.00 → 7971.86] It's on the screen?
[7972.12 → 7972.82] Where is it?
[7973.62 → 7974.22] I have no idea.
[7974.30 → 7974.46] Okay,
[7974.50 → 7974.62] well,
[7974.66 → 7974.90] whatever.
[7974.90 → 7976.00] The point is,
[7976.10 → 7978.40] I had a meeting with Intel back at Computer.
[7978.86 → 7985.36] I broke their balls a little bit about what I felt was a really misleading aspect of their marketing,
[7985.36 → 7995.14] where they said that Arc B580 was the best GPU under $250 or $300 or whatever it was.
[7995.18 → 7995.62] And I was like,
[7996.00 → 7996.34] okay,
[7996.44 → 7997.84] show me one for under that price.
[7998.04 → 7998.94] And they couldn't.
[7999.00 → 8000.00] And it got a little tense.
[8000.38 → 8001.04] And I was like,
[8001.46 → 8002.88] I need a plan from you guys.
[8003.66 → 8007.46] So that I stopped being a liar every time that I talk about your MSRPs,
[8007.56 → 8008.24] because it's not okay.
[8009.12 → 8010.40] And you know what?
[8010.44 → 8013.84] They never really got back to me on the timeline that I asked for.
[8014.62 → 8017.02] But within a span of weeks,
[8017.20 → 8017.86] not months,
[8018.84 → 8020.62] Arc B580s were available for MSRP,
[8020.78 → 8021.50] which was all I wanted.
[8022.00 → 8024.58] And they have consistently been available for this price,
[8024.72 → 8025.84] to the point where,
[8027.06 → 8027.40] guys,
[8027.68 → 8028.90] it's a great deal.
[8029.26 → 8030.20] It's a great card.
[8030.56 → 8032.10] It will slay 1080p.
[8032.36 → 8034.82] It's even quite 1440p capable,
[8035.00 → 8035.78] and it's $250.
[8035.78 → 8038.04] I freaking love this thing,
[8038.28 → 8040.00] and I want them to sell lots of them.
[8040.48 → 8040.92] And I don't,
[8041.04 → 8042.06] you can use the
[8042.06 → 8043.16] you can use the
[8043.16 → 8044.08] the affiliate thing,
[8044.16 → 8045.26] or you can just not.
[8045.46 → 8045.60] I,
[8045.80 → 8047.02] this is completely editorial.
[8047.02 → 8050.92] I want competition in the GPU space.
[8051.06 → 8053.28] I want to see a B770.
[8053.40 → 8054.06] It's still rumoured.
[8054.14 → 8055.08] I don't know if it's real.
[8055.40 → 8057.26] I want Arc to succeed,
[8057.26 → 8059.68] because I need competition in this space.
[8060.02 → 8064.08] And Intel's architectural and software improvements are promising.
[8064.42 → 8068.70] Look at what they're doing on the MSI Claw AI8X+,
[8068.70 → 8068.96] whatever,
[8068.96 → 8070.72] whatever the stupid handheld is called.
[8071.40 → 8072.42] Look at the power.
[8072.78 → 8073.56] Look at the performance.
[8073.72 → 8074.74] They're still driver bugs.
[8075.26 → 8076.56] They still have work to do.
[8076.78 → 8078.96] But the trajectory is so promising,
[8078.96 → 8082.04] and I need Lip Boudin to not abandon this thing.
[8082.54 → 8083.42] We got to show growth.
[8083.52 → 8084.80] We got to show success for it,
[8084.80 → 8086.12] because I want competition.
[8086.28 → 8087.60] That's all I have to say about that.
[8087.72 → 8088.16] And you,
[8088.20 → 8089.88] you know he doesn't want to keep it around.
[8090.62 → 8092.14] He doesn't want to keep anything around.
[8092.14 → 8093.10] Exactly.
[8093.68 → 8099.36] I'm so upset that Pat is never going to see the fruits of Pat's plan for Intel,
[8099.54 → 8103.86] and that the stock just goes up because LBT just cuts jobs.
[8104.88 → 8106.28] Like, I...
[8106.28 → 8109.40] Anyway.
[8111.22 → 8112.86] What was I supposed to be talking about?
[8112.94 → 8113.60] Oh, right, yeah.
[8113.96 → 8114.80] David asks,
[8114.92 → 8115.48] oh my God,
[8115.60 → 8117.94] back on the Microsoft Power topic,
[8118.42 → 8120.84] is the current level of investment into AI sustainable?
[8121.68 → 8122.12] David?
[8122.14 → 8127.82] David knows that I don't think anyone really thinks that it's sustainable.
[8128.22 → 8129.50] But hey, are we in a bubble?
[8129.60 → 8129.96] I don't know.
[8130.02 → 8131.08] This isn't financial advice.
[8131.44 → 8134.16] There was one other thing that I wanted to point out, actually,
[8134.26 → 8136.12] since we're on the subject of GPUs, though,
[8136.64 → 8142.08] is that Intel Arc is not the only GPU that you can find these days
[8142.08 → 8145.04] for a pretty reasonable price.
[8145.78 → 8146.66] Hold on a second.
[8146.66 → 8147.66] I thought...
[8147.66 → 8148.12] I thought...
[8148.12 → 8148.74] Was it...
[8148.74 → 8152.14] Was it 5070 Ti's that were under MSRP?
[8152.34 → 8152.64] No.
[8153.12 → 8154.02] That's at MSRP.
[8154.48 → 8156.12] Was it 5070?
[8157.56 → 8158.22] Let's see.
[8158.76 → 8161.48] I thought there was one NVIDIA card
[8161.48 → 8164.90] that was actually under MSRP on New egg right now.
[8164.90 → 8166.24] Uh...
[8166.24 → 8168.08] No.
[8169.90 → 8170.30] Yeah.
[8170.42 → 8172.24] $20 rebate card.
[8172.86 → 8173.44] I don't know.
[8174.18 → 8174.58] I...
[8174.58 → 8174.84] Yeah.
[8175.20 → 8175.46] I...
[8175.46 → 8176.12] Hmm.
[8177.42 → 8178.26] Is it mail-in?
[8178.34 → 8179.50] If it's a mail-in rebate,
[8179.58 → 8179.96] I don't...
[8179.96 → 8180.42] I don't know.
[8180.66 → 8180.98] I...
[8180.98 → 8182.02] Mail-in rebate does not count.
[8182.12 → 8182.98] I counted a little.
[8182.98 → 8183.68] Mail-in rebate does not count.
[8183.78 → 8184.42] I counted a little.
[8184.50 → 8185.42] I don't count it.
[8185.88 → 8187.24] I only count it
[8187.24 → 8188.66] if it's decently substantial.
[8190.14 → 8190.54] $20?
[8191.40 → 8191.86] Would you...
[8191.86 → 8193.22] You would send a letter for $20?
[8193.22 → 8193.46] $20.
[8193.82 → 8194.70] $20 for sure.
[8194.72 → 8195.18] Yeah, it was $20.
[8195.42 → 8196.00] I just...
[8196.00 → 8199.88] It is a not even sort of hidden secret
[8199.88 → 8201.28] at these retailers
[8201.28 → 8202.66] that you get a mail-in rebate
[8202.66 → 8203.52] that's low enough
[8203.52 → 8205.02] and then nobody does it
[8205.02 → 8207.00] so it's just not even a discount.
[8207.14 → 8208.10] You know that.
[8208.52 → 8209.22] You know that.
[8209.40 → 8210.38] I know you know that.
[8210.74 → 8212.00] I don't think I have...
[8212.00 → 8212.06] It's totally a thing.
[8212.14 → 8214.02] I don't think I have ever told this story
[8214.02 → 8214.92] on Sancho before
[8214.92 → 8215.84] but back when I was
[8215.84 → 8216.52] the product manager
[8216.52 → 8217.98] for OCT SSDs
[8217.98 → 8218.82] back at NCI
[8218.82 → 8220.90] they would often
[8220.90 → 8221.72] like push me
[8221.72 → 8222.90] to take a bunch of inventory
[8222.90 → 8223.86] that I told them.
[8223.96 → 8224.20] I was like,
[8224.26 → 8225.48] you know that I can't move this
[8225.48 → 8226.38] with our run-rate business.
[8226.50 → 8227.70] You guys are going to have to do promos
[8227.70 → 8228.22] to sell them
[8228.22 → 8229.04] and they'd be like,
[8229.10 → 8229.82] no, no, it'll be fine.
[8229.84 → 8230.28] It'll be fine.
[8230.56 → 8231.36] Take all this inventory
[8231.36 → 8231.90] and I'd be like,
[8231.98 → 8232.86] okay, tell you what.
[8232.92 → 8233.34] Here's the deal.
[8233.40 → 8234.28] I'll take the inventory
[8234.28 → 8236.22] but we're on net terms.
[8236.36 → 8237.86] We're on net 30 terms
[8237.86 → 8239.26] but I literally
[8239.26 → 8240.80] am not going to...
[8240.80 → 8242.04] We could be at 31 days,
[8242.16 → 8243.02] 35 days,
[8243.32 → 8244.04] 300 days.
[8244.08 → 8244.54] I don't care.
[8244.54 → 8245.72] I'm not paying this bill
[8245.72 → 8246.86] until we've sold them.
[8247.50 → 8248.28] You can push me.
[8248.40 → 8249.86] You can dump all this inventory.
[8250.06 → 8250.64] You can stuff me
[8250.64 → 8251.46] is what the term would be.
[8251.52 → 8252.76] You can stuff me with inventory
[8252.76 → 8254.42] but it's your problem.
[8254.66 → 8255.70] It's still your inventory
[8255.70 → 8256.76] as far as I'm concerned
[8256.76 → 8257.54] until it's sold.
[8258.08 → 8259.26] And so what would happen
[8259.26 → 8261.42] is we would get to the point
[8261.42 → 8263.12] where my terms are due
[8263.12 → 8264.70] and they would ask for payment.
[8264.84 → 8265.30] I'd be like,
[8265.46 → 8266.88] hey, so here's the email
[8266.88 → 8267.78] where I said,
[8267.88 → 8269.08] I'm not paying you for these
[8269.08 → 8270.52] unless you move them.
[8271.04 → 8272.26] Here's my inventory report
[8272.26 → 8272.88] that I sent you
[8272.88 → 8273.66] on a weekly basis
[8273.66 → 8274.82] that shows that I do,
[8274.98 → 8275.20] in fact,
[8275.26 → 8276.08] still have them.
[8276.24 → 8277.68] What are you going to do about it?
[8278.16 → 8280.48] And there was this one time,
[8280.58 → 8281.68] I think we ran
[8281.68 → 8284.28] a $100 mail-in rebate
[8284.28 → 8286.66] on an OCT SSD.
[8287.98 → 8288.78] That's crazy.
[8289.26 → 8290.14] Because they had
[8290.14 → 8291.28] all the math
[8291.28 → 8292.16] that they could do
[8292.16 → 8292.92] on the back end
[8292.92 → 8294.24] for what the redemption rates
[8294.24 → 8294.70] would be
[8294.70 → 8295.98] and whatever, right?
[8296.34 → 8297.30] The fuzzy math
[8297.30 → 8297.84] that you can do
[8297.84 → 8299.04] with your instant rebates
[8299.04 → 8300.02] and your mail-in rebates.
[8301.54 → 8302.76] Anyway, we ran this promo.
[8302.84 → 8303.38] It was a big hit.
[8304.30 → 8305.92] And there was a time
[8305.92 → 8307.16] a little while later
[8307.16 → 8308.22] that they stuffed me again
[8308.22 → 8308.92] and I was like,
[8308.96 → 8309.82] okay, this is your problem.
[8309.90 → 8310.52] Why don't we do another
[8310.52 → 8311.52] $100 mail-in rebate?
[8311.56 → 8311.84] And they go,
[8312.68 → 8313.28] oh, Linus,
[8313.44 → 8314.44] I really don't know
[8314.44 → 8315.08] if we can do that.
[8315.26 → 8316.36] I go, why not?
[8316.40 → 8317.24] I mean, you did it before.
[8317.24 → 8318.70] And they're like,
[8318.78 → 8319.76] well, see,
[8319.84 → 8320.30] I might have gotten
[8320.30 → 8320.98] in a little bit of trouble
[8320.98 → 8321.96] because the redemption rate
[8321.96 → 8323.56] was almost 100%.
[8323.56 → 8326.76] I mean, yeah.
[8327.22 → 8328.00] The fact that it was
[8328.00 → 8328.76] only an almost
[8328.76 → 8329.70] is crazy to me.
[8331.18 → 8332.28] How do you just not
[8332.28 → 8332.98] mail a letter
[8332.98 → 8334.02] for $100?
[8334.04 → 8334.74] For $100?
[8335.20 → 8335.82] Yeah, buddy.
[8335.92 → 8336.56] I would.
[8336.74 → 8336.88] Dude.
[8337.26 → 8337.40] Dude.
[8338.68 → 8340.74] I bought a BenQ.
[8340.86 → 8341.80] I'll always remember this.
[8341.86 → 8344.04] I bought a BenQ CD writer
[8344.04 → 8346.08] at Future Shop
[8346.08 → 8347.22] on a Boxing Day promo
[8347.22 → 8348.90] because it was $25
[8348.90 → 8350.76] with a $25 rebate.
[8351.14 → 8351.54] And I was like,
[8351.60 → 8352.72] buddy, it's for real estate.
[8352.82 → 8353.88] Yeah, it was a crazy deal.
[8353.92 → 8354.58] They had a whole pyramid
[8354.58 → 8355.66] of them just like
[8355.66 → 8356.30] on a pallet.
[8356.38 → 8356.82] And I was like,
[8356.94 → 8357.82] I'll take one of those,
[8357.94 → 8358.16] sure.
[8358.88 → 8359.68] Did they max out
[8359.68 → 8360.50] how many you could buy?
[8360.78 → 8361.12] Yeah, one.
[8361.18 → 8361.76] One per customer.
[8362.20 → 8362.62] Yeah, okay.
[8362.62 → 8363.24] That makes sense.
[8364.32 → 8365.64] So that was a
[8365.64 → 8366.86] get you in the door thing.
[8367.08 → 8367.94] Oh, yeah, 100%.
[8367.94 → 8368.64] I don't know
[8368.64 → 8369.08] what was in it
[8369.08 → 8369.66] for BenQ,
[8369.84 → 8371.32] but something in it
[8371.32 → 8371.90] for Future Shop
[8371.90 → 8372.32] for sure.
[8372.32 → 8376.68] AW11682 asks,
[8376.78 → 8377.82] how do mail-in rebates
[8377.82 → 8378.50] actually work?
[8378.74 → 8379.60] Not a thing in the UK.
[8380.20 → 8381.18] So what you do
[8381.18 → 8382.58] is you buy a product,
[8382.92 → 8383.64] say, for example,
[8383.76 → 8385.38] this DOG Xbox Ally X,
[8385.44 → 8386.16] which, by the way,
[8386.46 → 8387.22] you could actually
[8387.22 → 8387.80] have a chance
[8387.80 → 8388.52] to win one
[8388.52 → 8389.62] if you make a purchase
[8389.62 → 8390.64] on LTT Store.
[8390.74 → 8392.28] We have the full details
[8392.28 → 8393.86] of our spend $100 plus
[8393.86 → 8394.74] for a chance to win
[8394.74 → 8395.78] the Sennheiser headphones
[8395.78 → 8396.24] I'm wearing
[8396.24 → 8397.22] or the DOG Ally X,
[8397.34 → 8398.40] et cetera, et cetera,
[8398.44 → 8398.66] et cetera,
[8398.66 → 8399.08] on the store.
[8399.40 → 8399.96] Go check it out.
[8400.28 → 8400.84] Let's say you were
[8400.84 → 8401.56] to buy one of these.
[8402.02 → 8402.22] Okay?
[8402.52 → 8403.44] You get a receipt,
[8403.90 → 8404.06] right?
[8404.12 → 8404.78] You get an invoice
[8404.78 → 8406.28] and you also get
[8406.28 → 8407.68] your product with the box.
[8407.92 → 8408.96] So what a lot of
[8408.96 → 8409.56] mail-in rebates
[8409.56 → 8410.24] would have you do
[8410.24 → 8411.82] is cut out a piece
[8411.82 → 8412.64] of the box,
[8413.06 → 8414.08] like something to show
[8414.08 → 8415.44] that you are redeeming
[8415.44 → 8416.02] it only once,
[8416.08 → 8417.10] some piece of the packaging
[8417.10 → 8418.40] and then you would also
[8418.40 → 8420.14] include your receipt
[8420.14 → 8421.34] showing that you bought it
[8421.34 → 8423.02] from a qualifying reseller
[8423.02 → 8424.72] and then you put those
[8424.72 → 8426.34] in an envelope
[8426.34 → 8428.10] with the mail-in rebate form
[8428.10 → 8428.82] that you filled out
[8428.82 → 8429.44] with your name,
[8429.54 → 8431.30] address and where
[8431.30 → 8432.68] they can mail a check.
[8432.88 → 8434.84] You send it to the address
[8434.84 → 8435.38] of the company
[8435.38 → 8436.98] and they send you back
[8436.98 → 8438.24] a check that you then
[8438.24 → 8439.40] deposit into your bank account.
[8439.80 → 8441.22] And the idea behind it
[8441.22 → 8443.18] is that this rigmarole
[8443.18 → 8444.56] of filling out forms
[8444.56 → 8445.60] and cutting out pieces
[8445.60 → 8448.26] of boxes is a hassle
[8448.26 → 8449.40] that most people
[8449.40 → 8450.44] won't go through.
[8450.68 → 8452.32] So it allows the retailer
[8452.32 → 8453.76] and the seller
[8453.76 → 8454.58] of the goods
[8454.58 → 8455.30] to,
[8455.66 → 8456.28] or the manufacturer
[8456.28 → 8456.80] of the goods
[8456.80 → 8457.70] to advertise
[8457.70 → 8459.08] a very aggressive price
[8459.08 → 8461.28] knowing that the lazy people
[8461.28 → 8462.32] who don't bother
[8462.32 → 8463.82] are subsidizing
[8463.82 → 8464.52] the people
[8464.52 → 8465.22] who actually get it
[8465.22 → 8465.80] at that price.
[8466.00 → 8467.50] So if they're doing like,
[8467.56 → 8467.80] you know,
[8467.86 → 8468.94] $20 off,
[8469.34 → 8470.50] so instead of being
[8470.50 → 8472.54] $420,
[8473.00 → 8474.16] it's $399
[8474.16 → 8475.52] after mail-in rebate,
[8476.02 → 8477.06] what that tells you
[8477.06 → 8477.62] is that
[8477.62 → 8478.58] what their margin
[8478.58 → 8479.62] would really support
[8479.62 → 8480.60] is a price of about
[8480.60 → 8481.98] $407
[8481.98 → 8483.54] or, you know,
[8483.62 → 8484.72] $412
[8484.72 → 8486.00] and they'll have
[8486.00 → 8487.04] their own internal data
[8487.04 → 8487.88] for what percentage
[8487.88 → 8488.76] of people are likely
[8488.76 → 8489.82] to redeem these
[8489.82 → 8490.78] mail-in rebates
[8490.78 → 8493.78] at what sort of
[8493.78 → 8494.94] different rebate amounts
[8494.94 → 8495.80] and in different
[8495.80 → 8496.48] product segments
[8496.48 → 8497.14] it might be different
[8497.14 → 8497.52] as well.
[8498.08 → 8499.20] And from different retailers,
[8499.38 → 8500.36] you can have a very
[8500.36 → 8501.30] different customer base
[8501.30 → 8502.24] with a very different
[8502.24 → 8505.42] appetite for deal hunting
[8505.42 → 8506.30] and coupon cutting.
[8506.30 → 8509.28] Cats says,
[8509.38 → 8510.16] don't forget they expire.
[8510.24 → 8510.72] That's right.
[8511.22 → 8511.46] So,
[8511.90 → 8512.92] and you have to do it
[8512.92 → 8513.54] within a certain amount
[8513.54 → 8514.00] of time
[8514.00 → 8515.30] or the deal expires.
[8519.18 → 8519.56] Yeah,
[8520.06 → 8520.92] that's a mail-in rebate.
[8521.10 → 8521.54] There you go.
[8521.90 → 8522.66] And it turns out
[8522.66 → 8523.90] if you do a $100 one,
[8524.70 → 8525.60] pretty much everyone
[8525.60 → 8527.00] will redeem it.
[8531.00 → 8532.50] Amazon says no
[8532.50 → 8533.98] to AI shopping.
[8534.56 → 8536.02] This was put in the doc
[8536.02 → 8536.64] by Jordan.
[8537.44 → 8538.56] Amazon is suing
[8538.56 → 8539.90] perplexity AI
[8539.90 → 8541.48] demanding that the startup
[8541.48 → 8543.54] stop letting its Comet browser
[8543.54 → 8544.36] make purchases
[8544.36 → 8545.68] on behalf of customers.
[8546.62 → 8547.80] Amazon says that Comet
[8547.80 → 8549.30] covertly accessed
[8549.30 → 8550.52] Amazon customer accounts
[8550.52 → 8551.98] and disguised
[8551.98 → 8553.04] automated activity
[8553.04 → 8554.26] as human browsing.
[8555.10 → 8555.70] Amazon says
[8555.70 → 8557.20] this poses a security risk
[8557.20 → 8558.08] and interferes
[8558.08 → 8559.18] with the shopping experience
[8559.18 → 8560.60] and has demanded
[8560.60 → 8562.24] that perplexity
[8562.24 → 8563.74] end its misconduct.
[8563.74 → 8565.86] perplexity
[8565.86 → 8566.32] Oh man,
[8566.40 → 8566.68] that's the word
[8566.68 → 8567.46] I'm having trouble with today
[8567.46 → 8569.24] has rejected Amazon's claims
[8569.24 → 8569.72] in the past
[8569.72 → 8570.76] saying Amazon is using
[8570.76 → 8571.64] its market dominance
[8571.64 → 8572.76] to stifle competition.
[8573.76 → 8575.20] In a blog post titled
[8575.20 → 8577.08] Bullying is Not Innovation
[8577.08 → 8579.22] the startup calls Amazon's legal actions
[8579.22 → 8580.06] a threat
[8580.06 → 8581.62] to all internet users.
[8582.54 → 8583.72] Our discussion question is
[8583.72 → 8585.30] should AI agents
[8585.30 → 8586.64] be able to use your accounts
[8586.64 → 8587.60] and impersonate you
[8587.60 → 8588.66] to complete a task
[8588.66 → 8589.54] on your behalf
[8589.54 → 8590.54] if
[8590.54 → 8591.96] you instruct them to
[8591.96 → 8592.66] or
[8592.66 → 8593.52] should retailers
[8593.52 → 8595.14] be able to insist
[8595.14 → 8596.38] on human interaction?
[8596.38 → 8602.10] He's thinking
[8602.10 → 8602.36] I think
[8602.36 → 8603.04] he's having a think
[8603.04 → 8603.50] I think retailers
[8603.50 → 8605.18] if it's
[8605.18 → 8606.36] the retailers
[8606.36 → 8606.98] should be able to
[8606.98 → 8607.72] effectively do whatever
[8607.72 → 8608.16] they want
[8608.16 → 8609.06] in this situation
[8609.06 → 8612.64] I mean
[8612.64 → 8612.98] should they
[8612.98 → 8614.10] should they do it?
[8614.60 → 8614.94] Yeah
[8614.94 → 8615.96] they should be able to
[8615.96 → 8616.34] Yeah
[8616.34 → 8616.64] I mean
[8616.64 → 8617.28] they tell us
[8617.28 → 8618.36] that they don't want us
[8618.36 → 8619.56] to scrape their pricing data
[8619.56 → 8620.20] and
[8620.20 → 8620.86] we would
[8620.86 → 8621.98] never do that
[8621.98 → 8623.04] No
[8623.04 → 8623.60] of course not
[8623.60 → 8624.88] So do we really respect
[8624.88 → 8625.62] retailers' wishes
[8625.62 → 8626.28] to have their site
[8626.28 → 8626.98] used the way they want?
[8627.64 → 8628.32] No but it's not about
[8628.32 → 8629.26] respecting wishes
[8629.26 → 8630.04] this is like
[8630.04 → 8631.20] the ad block argument
[8631.20 → 8631.48] right?
[8631.64 → 8631.80] Like
[8631.80 → 8634.06] somebody can retaliate
[8634.06 → 8635.30] against you add blocking
[8635.30 → 8636.24] that doesn't mean
[8636.24 → 8637.18] you can't add block
[8637.18 → 8639.80] it's the same type of thing
[8639.80 → 8640.04] like
[8640.04 → 8642.10] if Amazon decides
[8642.10 → 8643.70] oh we don't want
[8643.70 → 8644.70] these automated things
[8644.70 → 8645.04] and we're going to
[8645.04 → 8645.92] try to stop them
[8645.92 → 8646.66] then I mean
[8646.66 → 8648.06] as far as my understanding
[8648.06 → 8648.78] goes
[8648.78 → 8649.28] they're completely
[8649.28 → 8649.88] within their right
[8649.88 → 8650.52] to do that
[8650.52 → 8652.20] should they?
[8653.60 → 8654.64] I don't necessarily
[8654.64 → 8655.24] think so
[8655.24 → 8656.34] I suspect
[8656.34 → 8657.88] the end game of this
[8657.88 → 8657.90] I think it's the liability thing
[8657.90 → 8659.42] because
[8659.42 → 8661.16] what's your thing
[8661.16 → 8662.04] that you always say
[8662.04 → 8663.86] machines can't be held
[8663.86 → 8664.30] accountable
[8664.30 → 8666.26] so if I said
[8666.26 → 8666.84] oh yeah no
[8666.84 → 8668.56] I told my AI
[8668.56 → 8669.22] not to
[8669.22 → 8670.44] then all of a sudden
[8670.44 → 8671.30] Amazon's the one
[8671.30 → 8671.92] who's on the hook
[8671.92 → 8672.68] for either giving me
[8672.68 → 8673.76] a refund for this product
[8673.76 → 8675.08] or dealing with me
[8675.08 → 8675.94] sending it back to them
[8675.94 → 8676.28] or whatever
[8676.28 → 8677.00] like they're the ones
[8677.00 → 8677.32] who end up
[8677.32 → 8677.70] with the liability
[8677.70 → 8677.90] That's what I would try
[8677.90 → 8678.48] to figure out
[8678.48 → 8679.46] that's what I would try
[8679.46 → 8680.04] to figure out
[8680.04 → 8680.94] is I would
[8680.94 → 8682.50] maybe block it
[8682.50 → 8683.02] temporarily
[8683.02 → 8684.92] and come to an agreement
[8684.92 → 8686.32] with this group
[8686.32 → 8686.80] or whatever
[8686.80 → 8688.64] that they have to assume
[8688.64 → 8689.92] some level of liability
[8689.92 → 8691.84] but there's no way
[8691.84 → 8692.68] that they're going to do that
[8692.68 → 8694.04] because they're an AI company
[8694.04 → 8694.72] and you know
[8694.72 → 8695.76] how AI companies are
[8695.76 → 8697.56] around their own liability
[8697.56 → 8698.74] for freaking anything
[8698.74 → 8699.64] whether it's people
[8699.64 → 8700.46] you know
[8700.46 → 8701.46] unliving themselves
[8701.46 → 8702.70] or whether it's
[8702.70 → 8705.22] I mean
[8705.22 → 8705.98] that's the worst thing
[8705.98 → 8706.60] I could think of
[8706.60 → 8707.54] so there you go
[8707.54 → 8708.10] or
[8708.10 → 8709.06] okay
[8709.06 → 8710.16] training their
[8710.16 → 8711.02] training their models
[8711.02 → 8711.88] on stolen
[8711.88 → 8713.34] data
[8713.34 → 8714.00] like
[8714.00 → 8715.62] they're just
[8715.62 → 8716.40] they're trying to avoid
[8716.40 → 8717.68] any kind of responsibility
[8717.68 → 8718.24] at every turn
[8718.24 → 8719.02] as far as I can tell
[8719.02 → 8719.88] and that's across the board
[8719.88 → 8721.40] yeah
[8721.40 → 8722.52] Max Overdrive said
[8722.52 → 8723.22] but some people have
[8723.22 → 8723.94] assistance through shopping
[8723.94 → 8724.56] for them
[8724.56 → 8725.64] sure
[8725.64 → 8726.38] what's the difference
[8726.38 → 8727.28] between that and AI
[8727.28 → 8728.32] because a human
[8728.32 → 8729.14] can be held accountable
[8729.14 → 8729.74] AI is
[8729.74 → 8731.18] yep
[8731.18 → 8733.22] that's it
[8733.22 → 8737.82] in other news
[8737.82 → 8738.62] that assistant
[8738.62 → 8739.48] would be the one
[8739.48 → 8740.16] held accountable
[8740.16 → 8742.08] servers in
[8742.08 → 8743.10] space
[8743.10 → 8746.44] this is another
[8746.44 → 8747.64] topic from Jordan
[8747.64 → 8748.64] Nvidia
[8748.64 → 8749.96] sent the H100
[8749.96 → 8750.48] GPU
[8750.48 → 8751.54] into space
[8751.54 → 8752.10] on board
[8752.10 → 8752.84] the Star Cloud One
[8752.84 → 8753.64] satellite on Sunday
[8753.64 → 8754.40] to test how
[8754.40 → 8755.10] data centres
[8755.10 → 8755.66] could work
[8755.66 → 8756.60] in orbit
[8756.60 → 8758.44] terrestrial data centres
[8758.44 → 8758.78] require
[8758.78 → 8759.54] massive amounts
[8759.54 → 8760.06] of electricity
[8760.06 → 8760.96] and water
[8760.96 → 8762.32] and Star Cloud One
[8762.32 → 8763.24] is the first step
[8763.24 → 8764.18] of a plan from
[8764.18 → 8765.14] Redmond Washington
[8765.14 → 8765.92] based startup
[8765.92 → 8766.58] Star Cloud
[8766.58 → 8767.46] to move resource
[8767.46 → 8768.32] hungry data crunching
[8768.32 → 8769.46] infrastructure into space
[8769.46 → 8770.86] hopefully to reduce
[8770.86 → 8771.62] the environmental
[8771.62 → 8772.50] impact
[8772.50 → 8773.88] ah yes
[8773.88 → 8774.56] ah yes
[8774.56 → 8775.56] let's fire off
[8775.56 → 8776.24] the rockets
[8776.24 → 8777.00] to reduce
[8777.00 → 8777.78] the environmental
[8777.78 → 8778.20] impact
[8778.20 → 8778.44] yes
[8778.44 → 8779.04] and don't forget
[8779.04 → 8779.76] very good
[8779.76 → 8780.42] don't forget
[8780.42 → 8781.14] clutter up
[8781.14 → 8781.94] low earth orbit
[8781.94 → 8782.96] here we need that
[8782.96 → 8783.36] ah yes
[8783.36 → 8784.64] very, very good
[8784.64 → 8784.94] yes
[8784.94 → 8786.30] during the satellite's
[8786.30 → 8787.22] three year mission
[8787.22 → 8788.18] Nvidia will be
[8788.18 → 8789.18] testing a range
[8789.18 → 8790.08] of AI use cases
[8790.08 → 8791.20] including analyzing
[8791.20 → 8792.14] images of the earth
[8792.14 → 8793.18] and running an LLM
[8793.18 → 8793.70] by Google
[8793.70 → 8795.76] not to be outdone
[8795.76 → 8796.72] Google announced
[8796.72 → 8797.62] Sun catcher
[8797.62 → 8798.98] aiming to use
[8798.98 → 8800.00] solar power to run
[8800.00 → 8800.78] super efficient
[8800.78 → 8801.74] AI infrastructure
[8801.74 → 8802.64] I mean
[8802.64 → 8803.10] cool
[8803.10 → 8804.56] the project plans
[8804.56 → 8805.14] to launch two
[8805.14 → 8805.90] prototype satellites
[8805.90 → 8807.26] by early 2027
[8807.26 → 8809.44] this all comes
[8809.44 → 8810.30] after Amazon founder
[8810.30 → 8810.88] Jeff Bezos
[8810.88 → 8811.84] predicted
[8811.84 → 8813.24] gigawatt scale
[8813.24 → 8813.76] data centres
[8813.76 → 8814.22] would be built
[8814.22 → 8814.60] in space
[8814.60 → 8815.12] within the next
[8815.12 → 8815.98] 10 to 20 years
[8815.98 → 8817.42] where the continuously
[8817.42 → 8818.62] available solar energy
[8818.62 → 8819.14] will see them
[8819.14 → 8820.48] eventually outperform
[8820.48 → 8822.12] terrestrial data centres
[8822.12 → 8823.44] Bezos says
[8823.44 → 8824.52] space based infrastructure
[8824.52 → 8825.26] is the next step
[8825.26 → 8826.02] of using space
[8826.02 → 8827.22] to improve life
[8827.22 → 8828.50] on earth
[8828.50 → 8832.62] you look so mad
[8832.62 → 8833.22] it's great
[8833.22 → 8834.70] in other space news
[8834.70 → 8835.70] spews
[8835.70 → 8837.30] semiconductor startup
[8837.30 → 8838.14] Bear
[8838.14 → 8839.18] has signed a launch
[8839.18 → 8839.92] agreement with SpaceX
[8839.92 → 8841.02] to integrate the company's
[8841.02 → 8842.16] experimental fab ship
[8842.16 → 8843.26] payloads into 12
[8843.26 → 8844.00] upcoming launches
[8844.00 → 8845.52] the fab ships
[8845.52 → 8846.56] will not enter orbit
[8846.56 → 8847.22] they will remain
[8847.22 → 8848.22] attached to the booster
[8848.22 → 8849.58] and return to earth
[8849.58 → 8850.52] within about 10 minutes
[8850.52 → 8851.00] of launch
[8851.00 → 8852.46] during each mission
[8852.46 → 8853.80] the fab ships
[8853.80 → 8854.76] will conduct tests
[8854.76 → 8856.04] to evaluate the feasibility
[8856.04 → 8857.24] of space based
[8857.24 → 8858.38] chip fabrication
[8858.38 → 8860.12] this stuff is crazy
[8860.12 → 8861.04] including whether
[8861.04 → 8862.30] semiconductor materials
[8862.30 → 8863.24] can withstand
[8863.24 → 8864.54] the journey to space
[8864.54 → 8865.78] and the subsequent
[8865.78 → 8866.64] re-entry
[8866.64 → 8870.54] yeah that stuff's nuts
[8870.54 → 8871.88] but why though
[8871.88 → 8873.94] I don't remember
[8873.94 → 8874.86] is it to avoid
[8874.86 → 8875.78] like movement
[8875.78 → 8876.50] of the earth
[8876.50 → 8878.42] I honestly
[8878.42 → 8880.72] I honestly
[8880.72 → 8881.26] don't remember
[8881.26 → 8881.48] I
[8881.48 → 8884.56] it's been so long
[8884.56 → 8885.30] since I've read about this
[8885.30 → 8886.16] but this is like
[8886.16 → 8886.70] a thing
[8886.70 → 8888.14] it's an oxygen
[8888.14 → 8889.30] free environment
[8889.30 → 8890.10] a lot of
[8890.10 → 8890.88] a lot of fabrication
[8890.88 → 8891.82] is done under vacuum
[8891.82 → 8892.54] that's something
[8892.54 → 8893.60] yeah but we can
[8893.60 → 8894.42] create
[8894.42 → 8895.26] cat OS says
[8895.26 → 8896.14] I think it was to do
[8896.14 → 8896.84] with clean room
[8896.84 → 8897.36] but like
[8897.36 → 8898.44] yeah but there's so much
[8898.44 → 8899.60] radiation out there
[8899.60 → 8901.84] so you're going to have
[8901.84 → 8902.32] what you're going to have
[8902.32 → 8903.38] this like shielded
[8903.38 → 8904.72] orbiting fab thing
[8904.72 → 8905.28] how about when you need
[8905.28 → 8906.04] to perform maintenance
[8906.04 → 8906.36] on it
[8906.36 → 8906.78] like have we
[8906.78 → 8907.66] have we gone mad
[8907.66 → 8908.08] microgravity
[8908.08 → 8908.98] that's it
[8908.98 → 8910.68] it's microgravity
[8910.68 → 8912.18] oh
[8912.18 → 8913.68] it's not the vacuum
[8913.68 → 8915.88] it allows you to create
[8915.88 → 8917.00] perfect spheres
[8917.00 → 8917.74] more easily
[8917.74 → 8919.24] microgravity
[8919.24 → 8921.06] which makes a ton
[8921.06 → 8921.58] of sense
[8921.58 → 8925.80] long line
[8925.80 → 8927.18] because I'm remembering
[8927.18 → 8928.12] that's why they
[8928.12 → 8929.58] that's why they're doing
[8929.58 → 8930.28] drug research
[8930.28 → 8931.08] in space as well
[8931.08 → 8931.80] a lot of it's
[8931.80 → 8932.56] microgravity
[8932.56 → 8934.10] a lot of our research
[8934.10 → 8935.58] for like making things
[8935.58 → 8936.18] on earth
[8936.18 → 8937.62] always has to deal
[8937.62 → 8938.60] with gravity
[8938.60 → 8938.92] right
[8938.92 → 8940.16] so when you take
[8940.16 → 8940.90] gravity out of the
[8940.90 → 8941.30] equation
[8941.30 → 8942.96] some things change
[8942.96 → 8944.42] in some cases
[8944.42 → 8945.24] for the better
[8945.24 → 8946.10] when trying to make
[8946.10 → 8946.78] certain things
[8946.78 → 8948.08] got it
[8948.08 → 8948.96] long line
[8948.96 → 8949.30] it says
[8949.30 → 8949.94] companies will do
[8949.94 → 8950.82] anything to not
[8950.82 → 8951.28] bring tech
[8951.28 → 8952.64] bring chip production
[8952.64 → 8953.64] to the west
[8953.64 → 8956.98] literally put it
[8956.98 → 8957.72] in space
[8957.72 → 8960.62] dude imagine
[8960.62 → 8961.32] the cost
[8961.32 → 8962.18] imagine the cost
[8962.18 → 8963.28] imagine how many
[8963.28 → 8963.82] they're going to be able
[8963.82 → 8964.58] to make in the
[8964.58 → 8965.82] in that amount of time
[8965.82 → 8967.80] imagine the cost
[8967.80 → 8968.64] of each one of those
[8968.64 → 8969.14] chips
[8969.14 → 8971.66] oh man
[8971.66 → 8973.48] it would be cooler
[8973.48 → 8974.34] it would be cooler
[8974.34 → 8975.18] if it was like
[8975.18 → 8976.34] moon base or something
[8976.34 → 8977.64] uh
[8977.64 → 8979.56] yeah you're still
[8979.56 → 8979.72] gonna
[8979.72 → 8980.00] maybe
[8980.00 → 8980.70] maybe they're just
[8980.70 → 8981.94] doing research for now
[8981.94 → 8982.70] and then it becomes
[8982.70 → 8983.58] moon base or something
[8983.58 → 8984.30] later but
[8984.30 → 8984.96] yeah
[8984.96 → 8987.08] all right
[8987.08 → 8987.78] um
[8987.78 → 8989.30] we also have a
[8989.30 → 8990.12] we have a couple more
[8990.12 → 8991.14] topics that we have

[9094.90 → 9095.68] there 's's this
[9095.68 → 9096.70] event coming up
[9096.70 → 9097.42] that I know a lot
[9097.42 → 9098.00] of people get
[9098.00 → 9098.62] stop it
[9098.62 → 9099.68] the show is brought
[9099.68 → 9100.84] to you by green
[9100.84 → 9102.00] if you've ever been
[9102.00 → 9102.86] frustrated by the
[9102.86 → 9103.98] high price and
[9103.98 → 9104.62] limited store
[9104.62 → 9105.70] options of cloud
[9105.70 → 9107.52] services green now
[9107.52 → 9109.52] offers NAS as a
[9109.52 → 9110.80] solution you can
[9110.80 → 9111.68] locally save up to
[9111.68 → 9112.98] 60 terabytes of data
[9112.98 → 9113.78] that's roughly 20
[9113.78 → 9114.48] million pictures or
[9114.48 → 9116.18] 40 000 movies or
[9116.18 → 9117.30] 62 million files
[9117.30 → 9117.70] like how do you
[9117.70 → 9118.60] define files you
[9118.60 → 9118.88] know what don't
[9118.88 → 9119.32] worry about it the
[9119.32 → 9120.32] point is its also
[9120.32 → 9121.00] compatible with a
[9121.00 → 9121.82] wide range of third
[9121.82 → 9122.84] party hard drives as
[9122.84 → 9123.52] well which is important
[9123.52 → 9124.34] to bring up because
[9124.34 → 9125.70] green has NAS
[9125.70 → 9126.66] competitors who have
[9126.66 → 9128.90] kind of not been
[9128.90 → 9129.72] super clear on
[9129.72 → 9130.22] whether they should
[9130.22 → 9131.12] support third-party
[9131.12 → 9132.04] hard drives recently
[9132.04 → 9133.16] and backing up
[9133.16 → 9133.90] albums from things
[9133.90 → 9134.66] like your iPhone or
[9134.66 → 9135.26] computer can be
[9135.26 → 9136.20] automated making it
[9136.20 → 9137.64] beginner-friendly you
[9137.64 → 9138.38] can connect quickly
[9138.38 → 9139.96] via NFC start sharing
[9139.96 → 9141.28] and access files fast
[9141.28 → 9142.16] on windows' macOS
[9142.16 → 9143.16] android iOS and
[9143.16 → 9144.48] your TV the NAS
[9144.48 → 9145.20] also has faster
[9145.20 → 9146.04] speeds than standard
[9146.04 → 9146.86] cloud transfer thanks
[9146.86 → 9147.94] to its one gigabit
[9147.94 → 9149.00] network port allowing
[9149.00 → 9149.92] you to transfer a one
[9149.92 → 9150.74] gigabyte file in
[9150.74 → 9151.36] seconds how many
[9151.36 → 9152.20] seconds I think i
[9152.20 → 9152.66] could tell you that
[9152.66 → 9153.76] probably eight and
[9153.76 → 9154.82] with raid redundancy
[9154.82 → 9156.02] your files are safe
[9156.02 → 9157.14] even during a drive
[9157.14 → 9158.60] failure so save up
[9158.60 → 9159.76] to 20 on an green
[9159.76 → 9160.88] NAS today there's
[9160.88 → 9162.04] more info in the
[9162.04 → 9162.92] video description
[9162.92 → 9165.18] disclosure invested in
[9165.18 → 9166.72] Esther, but that's
[9166.72 → 9167.74] fine I will still take
[9167.74 → 9168.60] green's money because
[9168.60 → 9169.48] those NAS are actually
[9169.48 → 9170.78] kind of cool really
[9170.78 → 9171.26] good value
[9171.26 → 9173.20] you know what else could
[9173.20 → 9173.98] be perfect value
[9173.98 → 9175.68] oh my god I thought
[9175.68 → 9176.16] he'd forget
[9176.16 → 9180.46] you know I wouldn't
[9180.46 → 9181.68] buy like if is you
[9181.68 → 9183.20] and I sang another
[9183.20 → 9184.60] Christmas album I don't
[9184.60 → 9186.00] think I'd buy that if
[9186.00 → 9187.50] Riley sang a Christmas
[9187.50 → 9190.30] album I would buy that
[9190.30 → 9191.48] I'd buy that for a
[9191.48 → 9193.70] dollar I'd buy that I'd
[9193.70 → 9194.42] buy that for more than
[9194.42 → 9196.10] a dollar okay I know the
[9196.10 → 9196.82] reference but I'd buy
[9196.82 → 9197.46] that for more than a
[9197.46 → 9198.32] dollar okay thirteen
[9198.32 → 9199.76] dollars it's a digital
[9199.76 → 9201.04] product okay imagine

[9282.40 → 9284.14] in principle I have to
[9284.14 → 9285.38] approve it I have to
[9285.38 → 9286.28] approve it and that's
[9286.28 → 9287.64] still not true
[9287.64 → 9290.40] LTT Christmas album vinyls so
[9290.40 → 9291.90] you heard it here first a
[9291.90 → 9292.86] certain amount so here's
[9292.86 → 9294.78] what we're going to do here's
[9294.78 → 9296.70] what we'll do all right we
[9296.70 → 9298.66] will we will take the
[9298.66 → 9300.90] original songs we will add
[9300.90 → 9302.72] some more because I think we
[9302.72 → 9303.98] should probably have some new
[9303.98 → 9304.78] songs there really weren't
[9304.78 → 9307.14] that many you mean as
[9307.14 → 9308.76] they were written as they were
[9308.76 → 9310.10] written in terms of lyrics yeah
[9310.10 → 9312.48] yeah not saying no heavens' no
[9312.48 → 9313.82] no, no none of that will be
[9313.82 → 9315.42] reused creative freedom to
[9315.42 → 9317.02] rewrite yeah I mean we could
[9317.02 → 9318.04] make some tweaks they weren't
[9318.04 → 9319.02] bad some of them were pretty
[9319.02 → 9322.92] bad um but we might do a
[9322.92 → 9323.92] couple new we'll do a couple
[9323.92 → 9325.08] fresh tracks it won't be Riley
[9325.08 → 9326.32] singing every time I think we
[9326.32 → 9327.82] could still have a couple of people
[9327.82 → 9330.12] participate as long as they like
[9330.12 → 9332.54] are decent this time auto-tune has
[9332.54 → 9335.00] come a long way in the last 10
[9335.00 → 9338.82] years okay in 2020 let's say
[9338.82 → 9340.64] let's say 2027 to give ourselves
[9340.64 → 9342.54] time 2027
[9342.54 → 9346.28] leg 27 we could do it next year
[9346.28 → 9347.38] easily we don't need to wait till
[9347.38 → 9349.62] 2027 I'm not even like trying to
[9349.62 → 9351.64] be annoying about this I am not
[9351.64 → 9354.20] trying to overpromise if we can do
[9354.20 → 9357.54] 2027 2026 it's its it's a year we
[9357.54 → 9359.40] can make it out like promise you
[9359.40 → 9360.84] Riley can make an album a year from
[9360.84 → 9362.22] now do you no, no it's not that
[9362.22 → 9363.28] that's not what I'm concerned about
[9363.28 → 9364.58] I'm concerned about like we've got to
[9364.58 → 9365.74] figure out packaging we've got to
[9365.74 → 9367.70] figure out how to ship like a vinyl
[9367.70 → 9369.86] we've never done it before and is
[9369.86 → 9371.50] it is easy maybe, but we've never done
[9371.50 → 9373.42] it before we've got to figure out a
[9373.42 → 9374.72] partner to actually get them
[9374.72 → 9376.04] pressed like i I don't want to put
[9376.04 → 9377.12] I don't want to put that team in a
[9377.12 → 9378.38] position where they're like holy
[9378.38 → 9379.68] crap why did Linus promise to do
[9379.68 → 9380.72] this next year this sucks we don't
[9380.72 → 9382.22] have enough time like we might have
[9382.22 → 9383.76] to ship by sea we might have to ship
[9383.76 → 9385.00] by sea from wherever they're being
[9385.00 → 9387.10] manufactured I don't know I can't
[9387.10 → 9388.64] promise what I don't know what i
[9388.64 → 9391.90] can say is 2027 is probably almost
[9391.90 → 9394.18] certainly doable okay that gives us
[9394.18 → 9396.48] can we say that we might do 2026
[9396.48 → 9397.56] but we're just not going to commit to
[9397.56 → 9399.50] it at this time I would love if we
[9399.50 → 9402.12] could do 2026 we will commit to at the
[9402.12 → 9405.38] latest Christmas 2027 we will
[9405.38 → 9407.72] hopefully commit to 2027 I can't
[9407.72 → 9408.86] promise let's not commit to anything
[9408.86 → 9411.16] I like not committing to anything I'm
[9411.16 → 9413.80] cool with that yeah okay all right so
[9413.80 → 9418.26] so Riley we will yeah I mean I haven't
[9418.26 → 9419.74] spoken with Riley about this I'm sure
[9419.74 → 9421.74] he'd be he's going to have to want to if
[9421.74 → 9423.72] he doesn't want to that is totally fair
[9423.72 → 9427.38] then that's fine so so so Riley slash
[9427.38 → 9430.38] and people who can actually sing leg
[9430.38 → 9435.70] Christmas album um Christmas 2027 let's
[9435.70 → 9438.32] do it, but there will be no we will not
[9438.32 → 9440.38] speak of the original Christmas album
[9440.38 → 9443.06] being remastered or being re-released in
[9443.06 → 9445.24] any form if people really want it and
[9445.24 → 9447.98] they don't it's still on the forum you
[9447.98 → 9451.04] can technically buy it every year yeah
[9451.04 → 9453.94] i need to be very clear about
[9453.94 → 9456.24] this we have sold thousands of them and
[9456.24 → 9458.66] it literally sells every single year and
[9458.66 → 9461.08] they literally have for a decade and it
[9461.08 → 9462.74] literally shouldn't it does it shouldn't
[9462.74 → 9464.78] exist, but you can't, you can't say they
[9464.78 → 9468.16] don't want it when they are actively
[9468.16 → 9471.46] continually I can say forgive them lord
[9471.46 → 9476.14] they know not what they do that's what
[9476.14 → 9478.46] I can say is not right in matters of
[9478.46 → 9482.62] taste they just yes I think we've all
[9482.62 → 9483.96] met a tasteless customer
[9483.96 → 9490.30] if you guys hold on just 30 seconds
[9490.30 → 9494.12] for what somebody's typing back to my
[9494.12 → 9495.66] message on Teams you got to be kidding
[9495.66 → 9499.34] me right now okay amd clarifies Riley
[9499.34 → 9505.18] Murdoch 9 23 p.m November 7th 2025 i
[9505.18 → 9506.26] mean you know I do
[9506.26 → 9510.12] I am so happy
[9510.12 → 9514.96] this is great this is all I wanted for
[9514.96 → 9515.50] Christmas
[9515.50 → 9521.08] this is fantastic in all capitals with
[9521.08 → 9522.62] what time though question mark question
[9522.62 → 9522.94] mark
[9522.94 → 9525.74] well we'll figure that out we've got time
[9525.74 → 9527.20] we've got time yeah we've got time we'll
[9527.20 → 9529.26] figure that out the main thing that's
[9529.26 → 9530.48] important to me is that it's going to
[9530.48 → 9533.04] happen eventually if he needs till 20
[9533.04 → 9541.82] 27 sure okay so I think it'll be I think it'll be a combination release I think we'll have to do a vinyl
[9541.82 → 9563.02] we should probably do a CD and then for people who are not into owning physical media we could probably do a digital one we got to do it Conrad says um digital delivery is native supported on Shopify okay yeah all right, and we've got to do a digital version thank you Conrad I just mean I think the I think the should have a final for sure as well absolutely
[9563.04 → 9568.76] and some people are super into CD at this point like it's its CD's trendy again dude I don't know
[9568.76 → 9584.82] you might even want to do a thing where if you buy the CD or vinyl version you just get the digital download for free in addition um yeah maybe I'm pretty sure there's a way you can yeah therehave got to be a way to do that i I don't want to promise anything right now because I have no idea, but there should be no reason why we couldn't build a mechanism for that
[9584.82 → 9602.58] you could mail in code it yep um mini disc no we're not doing a mini disc uh you could also do something where the digital download is like uh like a super cheap add-on or something like that you could be like for an extra five bucks or whatever because I don't I don't know exactly how Shopify handles that, and so we'll figure it out but like uh
[9602.58 → 9610.82] okay yeah eight tracks I could totally see wanting the vinyl version like I will buy the vinyl version just to be clear um
[9610.82 → 9617.60] um but then I would also want the digital versions, and so we'll have to do dude I promise you the internal
[9617.60 → 9623.76] people using their merch budget on this is going to be extremely high dude Bridget is gonna she's going to lose
[9623.76 → 9629.58] her shit because I actually had a conversation with her earlier this week when I was like you know
[9629.58 → 9634.92] that design would actually look pretty cool on like an ugly Christmas sweater, and she's like is this approval
[9634.92 → 9641.64] to do a Christmas sweater and I was like whoa hold on but if we had a Christmas sweater as a time it
[9641.64 → 9649.12] would it would have to be a line dude if you really oh my god oh my god matching Christmas pajamas and a
[9649.12 → 9654.30] matching Christmas sweater and a matching Christmas album you do know that's going to push it to 2027 though
[9654.30 → 9660.82] right oh by all of it I would be okay with that all right oh man all right we'll see is it more time to be
[9660.82 → 9667.64] mastered my goodness all right I'm so excited all right Christmas onesie
[9667.64 → 9676.40] man now you've got the whole company all like excited about this jeez because it's exciting
[9676.40 → 9684.28] we have to just do things sometimes man it's fun it's a lot of work Luke that's sometimes fun is work
[9684.28 → 9690.06] oh man work is fun whatever yeah yeah I think you meant the second one
[9690.06 → 9697.50] you know we're going to sell like a few hundred of them right like no we won't any we won't, we will
[9697.50 → 9703.48] sell I promise you we will say way more than that I guarantee I have no idea how many vinyls to press
[9703.48 → 9709.82] I have no clue I have no idea this could be this could totally be a pre-order thing right
[9709.82 → 9716.18] um what you could probably do is put the digital one up for sale and then put the vinyl one up for
[9716.18 → 9725.16] pre-sale it's like it's like a weird it's like a weird like man ah I don't know buy vinyls of
[9725.16 → 9730.54] albums they have listened to like that is totally a thing you could put the digital one up for sale
[9730.54 → 9734.04] and then the vinyl up for pre-sale I can pretty much guarantee you can do that, and then you won't
[9734.04 → 9742.86] have to um massively over order if we don't do pre-orders yeah but I think it's okay if the digital
[9742.86 → 9747.32] one is up for sale first because then you can get reviews of it, and you would know if you like the
[9747.32 → 9752.72] music so we don't do pre-orders because we don't want to be stuck in a position where we don't have
[9752.72 → 9756.40] a firm timeline on something, and we are going to be just like holding your money indefinitely
[9756.40 → 9761.34] that's one of the reasons yeah um, and we don't do pre-orders because we don't want
[9761.34 → 9771.06] to set a bad example um for the industry where there's like questionable quality potentially and
[9771.06 → 9775.02] we're taking your money up front without you having an opportunity to find out if it's any good
[9775.02 → 9779.78] um, so there are certain things that we would have no problem taking a pre-order on I would have no
[9779.78 → 9784.40] problem taking a pre-order on a mouse pad with a new graphic for instance because it's our same
[9784.40 → 9790.94] proven high quality mouse pad but just with a graphic with a supplier that we've worked with
[9790.94 → 9795.54] umpteen bazillion times in the past, and we have a firm idea of what the eta is going to be but what
[9795.54 → 9800.00] I don't want to take a pre-order on is something like say for example a mod mat where something
[9800.00 → 9803.72] unexpected might happen, and we might not be able to deliver it in the time that we wanted to
[9803.72 → 9808.88] right so that's that's why we don't do pre-orders because not taking pre-orders is the right thing
[9808.88 → 9814.20] for reasons not because pre-orders are just blanket wrong and should never be done
[9814.20 → 9820.04] but because there are reasons that maybe they shouldn't be done, and we don't want to we want to put our
[9820.04 → 9827.80] money where our mouth is um all right AMD has clarified its clarifications on their controversial
[9827.80 → 9833.98] rDNA 1 and 2 driver note they will continue game optimization after all they will continue to
[9833.98 → 9837.80] receive new game support stability and game optimization security and bug fixes the other
[9837.80 → 9841.92] branch for newer cards is to allow AMD's engineers to move faster and integrate new features at a faster
[9841.92 → 9846.78] pace I still don't really understand what that means no this is further clarification of the
[9846.78 → 9854.48] clarification but here is a clarification I am the clarification of the clarification I would like
[9854.48 → 9862.54] to clarify that I am feeling a lack of gas, and so I need your help usually he's extremely gaseous
[9862.54 → 9868.46] we are attempting to get the environmental chamber that we bought recently at auction up and running
[9868.46 → 9880.22] however we have discovered that the gases we need are extremely expensive if anybody has the following gases
[9880.22 → 9888.94] or a connection to getting them locally here in Vancouver or like west coast Canada um or cheap
[9888.94 → 9897.58] please reach out to us via uh Reddit or the forum uh yeah just yeah public post is probably fine and we
[9897.58 → 9910.46] can dm you if you seem credible we need 15 pounds four ounces of r404a, and we need 10 pounds of r508b if
[9910.46 → 9915.74] you have a lead on any of these gases if you have some cylinders of them kicking around somewhere that
[9915.74 → 9921.82] you weren't going to do anything with a wow good for you because that's a lot of money worth of gases you
[9921.82 → 9927.26] must be very rich to have gases like that sitting around not doing anything and not sell them um but
[9927.26 → 9934.70] b thank you so much for maybe giving us a deal uh because it is going to be extremely expensive for us
[9934.70 → 9942.62] to get this thing is it expensive to the point where we like might just abandon it if we potentially like
[9942.62 → 9949.66] what's the yeah okay potentially we're going to do our best um so that was 15 pounds four ounces of r404a
[9949.66 → 9958.70] and 10 pounds of r508b even if we do get all the gases there could still be significant challenges in
[9958.70 → 9964.94] getting it running apparently it is so loud that anybody in the if we were not to enclose it
[9964.94 → 9967.74] anybody working in the lab would have to wear hearing protection at all times
[9969.34 → 9976.30] so there are challenges, but basically we would like to at least get to the point of part two
[9976.30 → 9980.70] where we get the thing running and I'm pretty bullish on that we actually managed to find
[9980.70 → 9987.74] the person the technician who decommissioned it and what he told us is that when he decommissioned it
[9987.74 → 9993.58] it was in great shape and working great so that gives us a ton of hope
[9995.58 → 10001.26] okay so that's that's where we're at I just thought we were collecting extremely large rooms that we don't
[10001.26 → 10009.18] use in labs like Pokémon or something uh the diff says quiet you um would northern Washington be okay
[10009.18 → 10013.90] maybe i actually just don't know what the complications of getting it over the border would be
[10013.90 → 10017.98] it's possible if the deal's right then we're gonna we would try to figure it out because we really want
[10017.98 → 10024.38] to try even if it doesn't end up being part of our setup overall we want to at least like get this
[10024.38 → 10033.34] thing working for the Lulu so we need to get our hands on these gases um can you take it in checked baggage
[10035.98 → 10042.22] that's an earlier in the show reference it's not an electronic all right Dan let's do some uh let's do some
[10042.22 → 10047.18] merch messages shall we're going into after dark then good Lord there are a few merch messages today okay
[10047.18 → 10055.58] been busy I wonder why oh yeah I meant to have a look at uh what you guys were into today the answer
[10055.58 → 10055.90] is
[10055.90 → 10066.46] holy balls okay what is it what is the answer when you have a combination of things going on you have
[10066.46 → 10069.82] the sweepstakes thing, and you have the discount thing oh no I just mean product wise people are
[10069.82 → 10076.30] super into the new man hoodie so this is good because um I had a long conversation or I've had
[10076.30 → 10080.06] many long conversations with the merch team because they're like okay what is our direction
[10080.06 → 10085.10] for when stuff is it orange is it red I'm like look I want to see this launch we did a poll but
[10085.10 → 10091.90] there's a big difference between what people respond to a poll to or what people say in a poll response
[10091.90 → 10098.14] versus what they actually buy right Firefox for instance um so I need to see this red one actually
[10098.14 → 10104.06] sell I need to see people resonate with red and the Ltd brand as opposed to orange and when that happens
[10104.06 → 10108.70] then we can make a decision we can chart a path forward in terms of like how our colour branding
[10108.70 → 10113.34] works so yeah when hoodie's doing pretty good you guys are super into it apparently transparent
[10113.34 → 10119.50] screwdrivers someone internally very recently expressed concern over our ability to move
[10120.14 → 10125.90] as many of the wan hoodie as we ordered and i I had a quick chuckle and was like it's going to say
[10125.90 → 10131.58] they'll get them oh yeah it'll be it'll be all right yeah everything's going to be okay um you know i
[10131.58 → 10136.62] think i you know what I mean there wouldn't be the first person to kind of bring up concerns and
[10136.62 → 10141.02] and stress you know around work over the last couple of years which is good we want to hear those
[10141.02 → 10145.34] things right we want to get a chance to address those things for anyone on staff who is watching
[10145.34 → 10153.58] right now right like it's um it needs to be a conversation um, but we're we're okay you know we've
[10153.58 → 10158.06] we've definitely had some struggles I mean we've talked openly about uh viewership not being where I want
[10158.06 → 10168.70] it right now on LTT um I mean we're having a lot of conversations of uh future and I think this
[10168.70 → 10173.18] we've talked about it a lot where there's that there's that hundred employee threshold that's
[10173.18 → 10178.14] really, really hard to cross and i I feel like what's going on right now is we've been sitting
[10178.14 → 10184.70] on the threshold long enough that in my opinion at least I can see the way off if that makes sense
[10184.70 → 10191.18] and certainly feeling like the path forward is logical it's been painful to sit here
[10191.18 → 10197.66] for this long but this is realistically relatively normal for companies that get to about this size
[10198.22 → 10204.22] um and I'm pretty excited about I don't know if we want to talk about them yet but I'm pretty excited
[10204.22 → 10209.58] about some of the plans that we have for like honestly pretty much every part of the company
[10209.58 → 10218.14] um and they all rhyme which I think is really cool uh like almost every department is taking a
[10218.14 → 10223.50] similarly inspired step forward does that make sense can I say that I didn't really leak any plans
[10224.62 → 10226.54] as far as I'm concerned you can just say it I don't care
[10229.42 → 10236.22] nope okay I don't want I don't want to I don't want a team's message on Monday of like why did I
[10236.22 → 10241.10] learn about this stuff on wan show we'll talk about it internally we literally have we literally have
[10241.10 → 10247.10] a section in the Monday morning email that includes stuff that was leaked on wan show yeah, but we'll
[10247.82 → 10249.34] we'll wait that doesn't mean we should use it
[10250.78 → 10255.34] Tynan says probably the right call in the chat but is it the fun call Tynan
[10257.74 → 10264.22] no it's not but you guys will just have to wait all right um but yeah I'm feeling pretty good about stuff
[10266.22 → 10274.14] it's absolutely not the fun call yeah see right uh okay want to hit me with a merch message den sure
[10274.14 → 10280.30] sure we got a bunch here and Linus it isn't actually no hold on okay one more thing I wanted to say is
[10280.30 → 10285.34] that even though yeah viewership hasn't been where I really want it to be um what has been really cool
[10285.34 → 10290.46] for me to see over the last little while is that sentiment around the content that we've been uploading
[10290.46 → 10298.46] has been really positive um with I think one exception out of the last like few weeks the uh
[10298.46 → 10305.02] like ratio has been way higher than what has historically been our average when I say way
[10305.02 → 10310.46] higher I mean like anywhere from 0.5 to a percent higher because we're realistically in a pretty narrow
[10310.46 → 10317.02] band um but that you that historically has indicated like banger video that people are really engaging with
[10317.02 → 10321.98] and really loving um another thing that's been really cool is like the support that we're getting
[10321.98 → 10328.54] from our audience on places like float plane has been amazing like we've been hovering around 40 000
[10328.54 → 10335.82] float plane subscribers for quite a while now like we're basically you know back to where we were near
[10335.82 → 10341.58] our peak we're a few thousand short but like wow peak was also juiced up from the hack and something
[10341.58 → 10348.70] that when you look into statistical averages of um like other platforms where you can see some of the
[10348.70 → 10356.14] numbers of conversion between subscribers or average viewership and amount of people subscribe to
[10356.14 → 10362.86] an external funding platform like you guys have come out to support us in a pretty big way, and you've
[10362.86 → 10367.82] done it through the store too like we know that times are not amazing in a lot of industries and we
[10367.82 → 10374.86] we would never ask you guys to spend money you don't have that we don't want um but if you do
[10374.86 → 10379.34] have it you know the way that you guys have supported us through the store has been absolutely incredible
[10379.34 → 10389.42] um so yeah I just wanted to just wanted to thank you guys um thank you merge message oh yeah right and
[10389.42 → 10396.14] the last bit was like because of your support we are going to be okay like everything's fine we to this
[10396.14 → 10403.10] day have never had to conduct layoffs um, and you know knock on wood yeah i I hope that that wouldn't
[10403.10 → 10414.86] happen um, and it's its all because of you guys thank you all right at Linus it isn't fair to expect
[10414.86 → 10421.10] employees to have founder passion what's your number one advice for a one-man business on hiring and more
[10421.10 → 10431.02] importantly trusting their very first employee oh man no pressure listening closely I don't I was
[10431.02 → 10434.94] about to say I don't know because make them live in the office I don't think
[10437.10 → 10443.10] I think that Luke would agree very strongly with the statement that I didn't handle it perfectly
[10443.10 → 10452.30] so oh sure it's hard for me to it's hard for me to credibly give advice I can tell you know some
[10452.30 → 10460.62] of the things that I feel I did well um a high degree of transparency is really important because
[10460.62 → 10466.38] that's going to help you achieve alignment and help you guys you know work together on hopefully adding
[10466.38 → 10475.26] more employees I think that um working alongside and leading by example is incredibly important um
[10477.10 → 10484.46] oh man this would tie very well into you know something that wasn't done that some steps are
[10484.46 → 10491.02] being made to rectify uh but that we aren't ready to talk about yet and is kind of pending a conversation
[10491.02 → 10496.54] between the two of us um but maybe Luke could give some of his thoughts on whatever it is he wants to
[10496.54 → 10502.62] say about this because realistically he's gone through this as the number one well number two
[10502.62 → 10508.54] technically if we count Yvonne but which I do but sorry Luke, but you know that still makes Luke you know
[10508.54 → 10514.22] the number two man right like he's the guy he was the first one that actually I think your employee
[10514.22 → 10520.62] number is technically one isn't it I think it depends on where you look on the healthcare plan
[10520.62 → 10526.94] it's one yeah on the because I think I wanted a meme one I wanted 69 or something yeah I think we both
[10526.94 → 10531.98] asked for that, or it was leet it was one it was one of the other, but you'd like litter legitimately
[10531.98 → 10539.66] technically asked first um I don't remember which i that i I don't remember the story but I remember
[10539.66 → 10544.86] we asked for the same thing and some I don't know yeah um and Yvonne was like this is awkward
[10549.02 → 10555.74] yeah anyway so like what what what would be your advice for a one-man business on hiring and more
[10555.74 → 10563.34] importantly creating a relationship that is trusting with their first employee now you're on the spot boom
[10564.06 → 10569.58] i sort of did this i sort of did this because of AJ right um oh that's true I wanted to hear the other
[10569.58 → 10578.94] perspective though he's going to dodge he dodged it he dodged it whoosh you gotta remember
[10578.94 → 10580.94] neo here
[10586.78 → 10588.06] oh that was crazy
[10588.06 → 10595.26] oh that was funny it's the hard incident all over again
[10598.62 → 10604.86] um I don't know opposite I'll try to give both so I'll, I'll un dodge I'll jump back in front of it
[10604.86 → 10605.58] um
[10607.74 → 10615.26] i in and I don't think this is too much of a secret in many ways I preferred and in many
[10615.26 → 10623.42] ways I think what we're doing now is super cool, but my brain operates more properly in a very small
[10623.42 → 10628.54] business mindset approach etc um
[10628.54 → 10628.78] um
[10631.18 → 10637.50] panic survival mode is Luke's love that actually though like it fuels me in a lot of ways
[10637.50 → 10644.38] um and things being like yeah I don't know so like i I liked it back then I liked the way we
[10644.38 → 10648.30] worked together no I don't think everything was handled perfectly but if you think you're going to
[10648.30 → 10652.94] handle everything perfectly with your first person like you're you're actually nuts um
[10652.94 → 10658.62] um you're realistically not going to handle everything perfectly with anyone so like you're
[10658.62 → 10665.74] going to have to deal with that eventually um oh yeah and I think it's just it's its often not
[10665.74 → 10673.82] making the mistake it's how you deal with it after the fact um like i I would like to
[10676.38 → 10680.70] yeah I have multiple examples of that right like not necessarily handing handling something super well
[10680.70 → 10686.54] and i I would like to hope to think that I did relatively well after that point in trying to
[10686.54 → 10694.30] fix the problem uh and I can think of recent ones and i and I fully expect if I keep managing people
[10694.30 → 10699.50] moving forward that that will keep happening moving forward it's just part of it um
[10700.78 → 10707.02] so I wouldn't worry too much about screwing up with them just because it's going to happen
[10707.02 → 10715.74] obviously try not to do it but focus more on just being good to them and when you make mistakes
[10715.74 → 10721.66] just correct it and like Linus said be transparent and be honest and when you screw up just tell them
[10721.66 → 10728.54] and never underestimate the power of a genuine apology and when I say apology I don't mean words I mean
[10729.18 → 10736.38] I mean talking through what you were thinking even if what you were thinking is embarrassing and
[10736.38 → 10742.30] and something that makes you question if you are actually that good of a person because you know
[10742.30 → 10746.22] if you're thinking if they're thinking it so you got to get it out there in the open you got to say okay
[10746.22 → 10752.62] well like here's what I was thinking and here's why I did what I did and I'm sorry, and the behaviour will
[10752.62 → 10758.14] change, and then it has to actually like change you have to actually do something um
[10758.14 → 10767.50] yeah uh in in regard to oh sorry no, no I'm done yeah go ahead I was going to say in regard to the
[10767.50 → 10776.14] hiring of that person oh um that's tough i i i kind of had an easy out with AJ because he just kind
[10776.14 → 10785.34] of like volunteered yeah, and then we started paying him hey this is working out so i kind of skipped
[10785.34 → 10795.42] that part but I would be pretty careful about it and at the same time I don't know if I would worry too
[10795.42 → 10802.46] much because this is like the one time ever that you're going to be incredibly close, and we'll see
[10802.46 → 10807.74] everything that they're doing so if it's not working out you could end it relatively quickly
[10807.74 → 10812.22] and that aspect is going to get more difficult over time oh yeah and there's a certain thing with
[10812.22 → 10821.34] hiring where like it's very easy to put on a face for an hour for an interview um i have witnessed
[10821.34 → 10827.34] it myself where someone is just very different once they're actually on the job site um or even
[10827.34 → 10833.82] remotely I've experienced that as well uh people will often say things um about how like a lot of
[10833.82 → 10838.22] my interview questions are like how will you how would you handle like this scenario and they say
[10838.22 → 10842.62] the things that you want to hear, and then you see them in that scenario, and they do the complete opposite
[10842.62 → 10851.82] you're going to run into situations where people just weren't what you thought they were um so try
[10851.82 → 10856.70] obviously try to hire the right person try to yeah ask some good questions try to make sure that you're
[10856.70 → 10861.34] bussing them out as best you possibly can but understand that it might just not work and if it
[10861.34 → 10866.78] doesn't work that you just need to move on and especially at that point your company probably quickly
[10867.50 → 10872.70] so to what to the to what Luke was saying about um this is someone that you're going to work with
[10872.70 → 10882.14] like side by side day to day a lot um you know for me um I think a lot of founders would say like
[10882.14 → 10889.58] don't befriend your employees you know draw a kind of hard line there um and there's definitely times
[10889.58 → 10897.02] when you know trying to be friends not because you know you want to uh not because there's like an
[10897.02 → 10902.46] agenda but because you just work side by side every day, and you like you know hired people that you like
[10902.46 → 10911.18] and stuff you know um has backfired many many many times for me um sometimes in private sometimes
[10911.18 → 10919.74] in public like it's uh it can get really messy um but like I don't have any regrets as far as first
[10919.74 → 10926.62] employee goes yet knock on wood um and so you know it was really important to find someone that i
[10926.62 → 10932.78] really wanted to work with every day and that's something that I would say whether you
[10932.78 → 10938.46] know take whether you allow yourself to be friends or whether you know maintain boundaries
[10938.46 → 10942.70] or whatever it is that your kind of approach the relationship is I would say that it's got to be
[10942.70 → 10952.06] someone that you want to get up and spend the day with you will spend more of your high quality
[10952.06 → 10957.98] mentally functioning hours with this person for at least some period of time than probably your spouse
[10958.70 → 10964.54] yeah right so it's like actually very important people i I think especially when they're first
[10964.54 → 10970.78] starting hiring people really underestimate culture fit and how incredibly important that is and that is
[10970.78 → 10979.02] still a thing when there's two of you it's just like it's its actually so important um you hear about
[10979.02 → 10986.14] this stuff like I remember being a kid hearing people talking about like oh like it is shouldn't
[10986.14 → 10991.98] matter who you know it shouldn't matter how I act I'm the best on the job I remember hearing that
[10991.98 → 10996.46] mentality and be like oh man okay cool I just need to get like perfect at stuff and then nothing
[10996.46 → 11002.86] else matters, and it's like no that's not how groups of people work you ideally are perfect
[11002.86 → 11008.14] at stuff, but you also need to not be completely insufferable to be around because if you are nothing's
[11008.14 → 11011.90] really going to get done properly no one's going to want to talk to you therefore collaboration is
[11011.90 → 11017.10] going to be a problem there's going to be adversarial relationships are going to be created
[11017.10 → 11023.98] it's its like it's actually incredibly not okay for them to be just toxic and impossible to work
[11023.98 → 11030.38] with um so don't hire just on skill either you need to be able to get along with this person
[11030.38 → 11036.14] no you do not need to be best friends um you need to be able to get along and be happy to work
[11036.14 → 11041.10] with them which is a very different thing sometimes they're related, but they are very different things
[11042.86 → 11048.78] yeah man I don't know why I looked at YouTube chat but I did we've got buddy here new world disorder
[11048.78 → 11054.70] co-workers are not friends they are co-workers share no personal info just talk about weather
[11054.70 → 11060.94] and I was like man you have to someone hurt you know yeah and then their immediate next
[11060.94 → 11066.14] message is I've worked with thousands of people over 35 years personal info will get used against
[11066.14 → 11069.90] you at some point people talk when you aren't around no matter how cool you think you are
[11070.86 → 11077.34] new world disorder there's some truth there, but it is also possible that people
[11079.10 → 11083.66] like you didn't seem super warm and fuzzy in your first message
[11083.66 → 11087.98] is it possible that
[11091.42 → 11095.34] you're the common denominator here I'm just I'm throwing it out there I'm just throwing it out there
[11097.50 → 11103.90] just throwing it out there um, and you know what though you know what though there is some
[11103.90 → 11111.42] truth there like even not co-workers like even like industry acquaintances I have had
[11112.14 → 11116.22] information that I have shared with people that I considered to be at least like sort of friends like
[11116.78 → 11122.30] industry friends I've had it used against me in public to damage me it has happened multiple times
[11123.02 → 11129.58] and I don't know man i um I don't think I can find myself at that point where I just go okay well
[11129.58 → 11133.18] then I'm just not going to share any personal information with anybody I'll just talk about the
[11133.18 → 11138.30] weather I don't think I can do that I don't think um I don't think I'd be happy like that and if it
[11138.30 → 11145.34] works for you then it works for you but I think I'd rather get hurt again yeah I'm generally a
[11145.34 → 11151.26] pretty open book I think for better for worse, and it's its come back to hurt me too but I think
[11151.26 → 11161.34] there are benefits to being that way right um it's you do not build trust with people by not giving trust
[11161.34 → 11169.18] um there has to be a little bit back and forth and I've appreciated when people that I work
[11169.18 → 11175.82] with are able to be open with me about things that might be going on with them that can help me
[11177.82 → 11183.50] accommodate them best I can to make sure that they're able to do like fully corporate company
[11183.50 → 11188.94] hat on this allows me to make sure that they're able to do the best job that they can and if this is
[11188.94 → 11194.78] like a very talented person who's in a rut uh it's pretty valuable to the company if we can wait
[11194.78 → 11201.66] the rut out and be a good place for them to be when they come back um and then also personally it
[11201.66 → 11208.62] just I feel like it's good for my soul so like company hat off um so I don't know I try to find as
[11208.62 → 11214.78] many things that satisfy company hat on and company hat off at the same time as possible it's
[11214.78 → 11220.30] tough it's not always possible, but you try to do it as much as you can all right my last YouTube
[11220.30 → 11227.58] message for the day from YouTube chat um dale Earnhardt seatbelt says LMAO out of the thousands
[11227.58 → 11232.22] of co-workers I've never been the issue but what about that time you worked with dale Earnhardt
[11232.22 → 11238.06] uh
[11240.94 → 11245.74] that doesn't get a ding Dan fine
[11247.98 → 11249.26] i have to wash my hand now
[11251.74 → 11260.70] oh man all right anyway uh Dan hit me with another sure good evening gentlemen thank you for the quality
[11260.70 → 11265.42] merch out of curiosity if you could host wan show from any location where would you want to host it
[11265.42 → 11273.02] from right here it is so much easier when we're just both in studio it is every time that I'm
[11273.02 → 11279.10] out on a Friday I actually get really annoyed because it's just like yeah it is sucks
[11280.14 → 11287.58] but when is like far superior but since you want an answer that's more fun than that um
[11287.58 → 11294.78] um from low earth orbit on a spacecraft I think if we were is we were in space together that would
[11294.78 → 11302.14] be the most fire wan show of all time I completely agree my I will to be less cool and interesting
[11302.14 → 11309.58] than that my favourite location wan show that we've done I feel like it's probably the japan one
[11310.14 → 11313.50] that was the one that I was going to say if I had to pick a favourite one I had actually
[11313.50 → 11318.70] yeah I had opened up a YouTube window so that I could search for wan Japan and then I came up with
[11318.70 → 11324.30] the better I came up with the better answer that's hilarious we're completely aligned on this love it
[11325.26 → 11328.94] it was so good I don't remember what the title was or anything to try to find it, but we were in the
[11328.94 → 11330.46] kimonos and everything here it is
[11330.46 → 11336.06] look at this look how much fun these guys are having
[11337.98 → 11340.70] and ed was passed out drunk behind the camera it was great
[11343.26 → 11347.90] didn't he finish setting it up and then just fall over basically yeah he fell asleep on the stairs
[11349.82 → 11355.66] oh it was so good we forgot we had to do it, and then we were both like wicked tired, and it's its
[11355.66 → 11361.10] probably the most tired we both were on one wan show together yeah the collective tiredness factor
[11361.10 → 11370.78] was pretty high yeah that was incredible awesome hello wan.dll hello back in much of my engineering
[11370.78 → 11377.50] work flight test there's a lot of working through good and sometimes weird tech requirements what's
[11377.50 → 11381.90] one of the weirdest requirements you've had to work with you added the word tech I did ruin my answer
[11381.90 → 11388.78] uh I'm so sorry I don't know where that came from actually probably the test above it because it's
[11388.78 → 11396.06] split on my monitor most of the weird requirements that I usually have to work with are people imposed
[11396.06 → 11406.22] not, not tech imposed sorry, sorry and I would say that the most frustrating ones usually come down to
[11406.22 → 11412.46] people not understanding the video production workflow like I remember this one AMD launch event I think it
[11412.46 → 11421.74] was the 580 was it the 580 or the 480 it was a Polaris based card maybe it was the 480 and I remember
[11421.74 → 11428.86] they had us all in the briefing room huge like there's probably like 80 to 100 tech reviewers and journalists
[11428.86 → 11437.26] and uh analysts and stuff in this room, and they go through this slideshow, and after it's done I go hey
[11437.26 → 11442.14] I need the slides, and they go well we can only send you a watermarked version of the slides and I go okay
[11442.14 → 11450.62] that doesn't work for me because the embargo lift is in 10 hours or whatever um at 8 a.m in the morning
[11450.62 → 11458.62] and I have to now write and do video guidance and wait for my editor and then I have to review this
[11458.62 → 11463.10] video for accuracy because it's the same day release, and then we have to encode it, and then we have to
[11463.10 → 11467.42] upload it and then I have to merch it and that is not a lot of time so what I really need is I need
[11467.42 → 11473.18] I need the slides without watermarks right now so that we cannot just dick around, and we can just edit
[11473.18 → 11477.74] the freaking video, and they go well um you can't have them because we're worried about leaks and I go brother
[11477.74 → 11484.62] people had their cameras out in the presentation it's literally already leaked if you guys care that
[11484.62 → 11490.30] much why don't you deal with the people go triangulate who the was sitting there and go
[11490.30 → 11497.34] deal with them which you can do I don't leak so why is this my problem those are the kinds of issues
[11497.34 → 11504.78] where it's just like dude help me help you does it make any of us look good if our slides have ugly
[11504.78 → 11510.30] watermark Linus tech tips all over them do you look good do I look good do we look competent
[11511.18 → 11517.90] then okay what's the point of a NDA I sign the NDA you give me the information I do my job right
[11518.54 → 11523.34] help me do my job and so you just I had to make it I think i I can't remember if it was director
[11523.34 → 11529.10] level or VP level that I had to go to get my slides like, and it's just stuff like that right
[11529.10 → 11534.06] where you just have to kind of go like another hilarious one is like you'll
[11534.06 → 11539.26] go into a really secure facility you'll go into like uh like a high privacy environment I'm not
[11539.26 → 11544.14] going to name it because I don't feel like I'm dealing with that um, but you'll have some piece of
[11544.14 → 11549.66] equipment like some scientific piece of equipment that's like yeah well uh you can't shoot the like
[11549.66 → 11557.02] the logo you know, and it's like buddy anyone who works in this industry knows what it is from
[11557.02 → 11562.46] looking at everything but the logo so what are you even talking about yeah right like you're
[11562.46 → 11567.58] obscuring the brand of what it is, and it's like yeah but I can shoot the entire thing I just have
[11567.58 → 11572.86] to blur the brand on it who are you trying to hide this from who are you concealing it from
[11574.30 → 11580.06] the people who are like building a know this high-tech facility like you are they know what it is
[11580.06 → 11584.14] from looking at it because there's only so many vendors that make I don't know let's throw something
[11584.14 → 11590.06] out scanning electron microscopes right like how many people make those okay so they know what it is
[11590.06 → 11594.70] and then everyone else you're just withholding information, and you're blurring up my video frame
[11594.70 → 11600.06] so what was the point of this it's all theatre right, so those are probably the most
[11601.82 → 11610.14] my favourite one was challenging a brand that didn't let us document uh one of the one of the machines
[11610.14 → 11616.94] exactly what you're describing um except later on we looked up the YouTube channel for the company
[11616.94 → 11622.78] that made the machine and there was a video on that channel of them delivering the machine to the
[11622.78 → 11628.70] company that we were at, and it shows the whole thing the logos the model name ever everything's on
[11628.70 → 11635.18] there, and they're delivering it to like it's its just it's its the most out there thing you could
[11635.18 → 11642.86] possibly imagine we did a tour at one point where there was this bizarre requirement that cost us
[11642.86 → 11648.94] probably at least half an hour to 45 minutes of just dicking around where they didn't want us to
[11648.94 → 11657.82] show the ceiling of the space we couldn't show the ceiling immediately on getting home we went to their
[11657.82 → 11662.94] site and there's just imagery all over their site that shows the ceiling of the space it's just like
[11662.94 → 11669.82] buddy of course like I just can't the problem is that it's a lot of work to say yes
[11670.86 → 11675.02] because and it's a lot of risk because you're personally responsible for saying yes people don't
[11675.02 → 11679.66] want responsibility and accountability and I've talked about this extensively in the past it's safe to
[11679.66 → 11686.54] say no but people who say no are not doers of things they don't accomplish anything they're obstructions
[11686.54 → 11692.62] they say they're people who they're people who by the very definition of their nature that by saying no
[11692.62 → 11699.10] they don't get things done whereas you know i I keep telling people whether it's my kids or people
[11699.10 → 11705.34] on the team here you got to live life by improve rules which means you can't say no you can say yes and
[11706.38 → 11713.34] you have to find a path forward you have to find a way to incorporate someone else's idea uh someone else's
[11713.34 → 11720.62] someone else's concept um you have to find a way to add to it rather than just block if it's not I mean
[11720.62 → 11727.82] it's not every time you say this I like sort of agree and then also totally don't um i think
[11727.82 → 11733.42] in like almost every scenario it's viable but if you push it to its extremes it's like anything
[11733.42 → 11740.78] pushed to the there's obviously wrong yeah yeah yes but just I think it's more looking at the overall
[11740.78 → 11747.58] pattern of behaviour are you a no person or are you a yes and person are you an enthusiastic co-contributor
[11747.58 → 11754.62] or are you an obstruction um, and sometimes you have to be an obstruction for the good of the organization
[11754.62 → 11758.78] for the good of yourself for the good of the person pitching the idea maybe they'd look terrible
[11758.78 → 11765.66] you know, and you got to save them right um hey I should jump off this bridge like no not yes and
[11765.66 → 11770.46] actually yeah yes and do it with a parachute except you're untrained and don't know
[11770.46 → 11773.90] what you're doing, and you're jumping okay fine yes and do it at a bungee jumping place
[11774.70 → 11778.38] like if you want the thrill of jumping off a bridge let's do it let's do it in a bungee jumping place
[11778.38 → 11785.10] doesn't service this bridge well um apply for a permit with the city, and you know like hey where there's
[11785.10 → 11791.58] a will there's a way I mean what to Tom Cruise climb the burn Palisa I mean come on you just got to
[11791.58 → 11797.90] be Tom Cruise so dedicate the next couple of decades of your life to becoming a movie star and be able
[11797.90 → 11804.54] to run very iconically I'm just I'm just saying you know be a problem solver in general yes

[11823.34 → 11828.70] inside from the inside boom got him all right yes and
[11830.14 → 11834.06] and that's it the mission accomplished it was an impossible mission, but you did it
[11834.06 → 11840.22] it's a great thing congrats up next come on I don't get anything for that fine thank you
[11841.50 → 11844.70] I proposed to my girlfriend last week she said yes
[11846.86 → 11850.70] and I got laid off a few days later oh I should have read this there was literally
[11850.70 → 11857.66] and then I found a new job in a few days and now my old company wants me back no them
[11857.66 → 11863.90] have you ever had a similar roller coaster of emotions I guess besides just now uh oh yeah
[11864.54 → 11868.70] definitely the uh the whole are we getting the channel are we not getting the channel in the
[11868.70 → 11872.78] early days of leg I'm not going to tell the story again because we've told it pretty recently but
[11872.78 → 11875.82] yes I have experienced that level of emotional roller coaster
[11875.82 → 11888.78] hey LDT my your mic damn hey LDT long time watcher first time writer love the always on time
[11888.78 → 11895.10] wan show and the vids out of curiosity how are Linus's braces going he said he chose those
[11895.10 → 11902.06] ones because they'd be off quicker um let me put it this way when the brand found out that I was using
[11902.06 → 11907.66] them they reached out about potentially collaborating I sent them back a bunch of my feedback on the
[11907.66 → 11914.94] braces and I haven't heard from them since I'm not surprised so that's where we're at um
[11916.14 → 11927.26] I am happy with the progress of my teeth moving however I am not thrilled with the kind of micro abrasive
[11927.26 → 11935.18] surface of these ceramic brackets and if anyone had told me that they sit prouder off the tooth
[11935.18 → 11941.34] than a traditional metal bracket I would have gone for invitation or traditional train tracks I would
[11941.34 → 11951.18] not have chosen these they have caused significant internal damage to my mouth, and it's very difficult
[11951.18 → 11960.14] for it to heal because they are so sharp like it's not like it's not like it rubs it's like it is slices
[11960.78 → 11966.30] it's unreal um especially the hook ones that are for like the elastics that go here and here
[11966.30 → 11972.14] um I have to get this uh I have to get this like semi-permanent wax coating that they cure with the UV
[11972.14 → 11981.66] light on basically from behind the canines all the way up on the top and bottom um in order for them to
[11981.66 → 11988.46] not just shred the insides of my mouth and that's even after multiple times shredding and scar tissue
[11988.46 → 11993.74] and shredding and scar tissue like i I had braces when I was younger and my Orth did say that part of
[11993.74 → 11998.22] it is just being older now and not healing as fast but I had train tracks when I was younger and there's
[11998.22 → 12003.26] no way that they were this sharp they just weren't these are they're super sharp
[12006.86 → 12013.18] hey LLD Linus out of all the projects you've subjected your home to over the years which ones
[12013.18 → 12019.34] had the most unforeseen consequences light switches my wife hates them so much
[12020.86 → 12025.90] like I could have said the pool water cooling loop but I foresaw that that could leak whereas the light
[12025.90 → 12031.18] switches and my whole family being irritated with me, i I thought they were going to be a boon i
[12031.18 → 12035.82] think we're working with in a valley to do better ones soon yeah stay tuned
[12037.98 → 12046.06] hello l to the l to the d yeah I know you know me Linus who is your favourite bob's burger character
[12046.06 → 12052.94] and why is it Mr fish odour oh it's definitely not Mr fish odour i i like i like Calvin fish odour but um
[12052.94 → 12063.82] um favourite oh my god I mean I think Louise is probably my ADHD spirit animal if I had to pick a
[12063.82 → 12068.94] bobs burger favourite character she's uh yeah she's she's amazing
[12071.18 → 12081.82] I finally built my first pc 9070 XT with a 90 70 100x whilst installing the NHD 15 I slightly gouged the cold
[12081.82 → 12087.42] plate is this likely to affect cooling or is there any way to test whether this is affecting my cooling
[12087.42 → 12094.46] it is very unlikely to affect cooling the only time I would think it would be a concern is if you like
[12094.46 → 12101.90] gouged it enough that a bit of the metal has like peeled up and it's holding it away from the CPU uh
[12101.90 → 12105.34] that's the only way that I'd really be concerned a little scratch in the bottom of your heat sink the
[12105.34 → 12110.78] whole like mirror finish thing is mostly for show it's mostly about overall flatness of the mating
[12110.78 → 12119.18] surfaces will the backpack magnetic chest strap return I wanted to get another one for my commuter
[12119.18 → 12124.06] bag ps I'm looking forward to the reading I'm looking forward to reading the ABCs of gaming to
[12124.06 → 12131.42] my daughter when she is born congratulations um I actually have no idea if the backpack magnetic
[12131.42 → 12136.94] chest strap is returning uh Dan is this one that we could maybe just forward to the CW team let me and
[12136.94 → 12142.14] we could get them an answer that way oh they didn't uh put their email in there so I will do that
[12142.14 → 12147.26] manually by starting a group chat and then scheduling a message oh no wait
[12152.06 → 12152.78] add them
[12155.34 → 12162.94] um okay I'll just leave that one for there for now um let's see love the show with you discussing your
[12162.94 → 12168.30] recent flight I was wondering is there any new plane or airliner tech that you find interesting
[12168.30 → 12176.30] oh man that new supersonic oh it's so cool it like doesn't have it happening it doesn't have sonic
[12176.30 → 12179.26] booms yeah no it's like happening they're like doing test flights and stuff I thought
[12182.38 → 12188.22] new supersonic uh who makes it is it uh is it what's the nuts the one that's been struggling
[12188.22 → 12196.54] Boeing new supersonic passenger jet no it wasn't them was it uh the boom overture yeah who makes
[12196.54 → 12206.62] this thing uh I can't remember but 60 to 80 passengers at speeds of Mach 1.7 over water and Mach 1.3
[12206.62 → 12211.34] over land to minimize sonic booms is that right does that sound right you guys
[12211.34 → 12221.42] yeah if it ever makes it crazy dude right ah it looks like a dart it's so cool look at it go
[12225.90 → 12234.38] so that's super cool um oh what's so nuts is it the 777x that has the like way better cabin pressure
[12234.94 → 12240.14] so it's supposed to end and better humidity so it has higher humidity and more cabin pressure so it's
[12240.14 → 12245.82] supposed to significantly reduce uh jet lag because part of jet lag is that you're in this like
[12245.82 → 12251.02] slightly deoxygenated environment with thinner air for an extended period of time and also there's like
[12251.02 → 12255.98] no moisture in it because of the air recycling something etc because they're bringing
[12255.98 → 12260.86] in that that super high up air, and then they're mixing it with the I've read an article about how the
[12260.86 → 12267.10] internal um cabin pressure and uh climate control works and then I've kind of forgotten half of it so
[12267.10 → 12273.02] take all this for the sort of ignorant rambling that it is but um yeah the 777x seems super cool if they
[12273.02 → 12281.90] ever manage to freaking deliver any of them um good luck with that Boeing what else is really cool oh
[12281.90 → 12293.02] the new global is amazing global 8 000 I think it is seriously this thing is wild 8 000 nautical miles
[12293.02 → 12304.94] mock 0.95 and look at it bomb it bombardier bombardier bombardier this one's automatically cooler
[12307.10 → 12312.38] I mean look how cool this guy riding in it is I think his trust fund is pretty cool
[12313.66 → 12321.18] yeah uh I don't know this might be out of trust fund kitty uh price point range Luke um yeah this is like
[12321.18 → 12329.18] birthday present money this is no, no no, no this is i I invested very well and made a lot
[12329.18 → 12335.26] of money I'm I'm a startup founder for sure if i uh is I have one of these this is I found my bitcoin
[12335.26 → 12340.46] hard drive yeah yeah there that's the one that's the Dan found his bitcoin hard drive sorry Dan
[12340.46 → 12348.54] I think this one's uh 60 60 mid or so i I forget what a global 8 000 is worth
[12350.06 → 12356.38] starting price lots of cool stuff happening in aviation right now oh, oh okay AI overview says
[12357.90 → 12363.58] uh the starting price is approximately 78 million overview I thought you don't read those uh I do if
[12363.58 → 12368.78] it's the only option a lot of the time you like it's not like bombardier puts a freaking MSRP on their
[12368.78 → 12374.46] site so you just have to kind of hope that someone was talking about it somewhere uh Wikipedia has 71
[12374.46 → 12383.18] million in 2014 but wait what does that don't make any sense the 8 000 is new uh oh yeah you're
[12383.18 → 12390.86] going to trust that AI overview you know what who's Luna jets who are you uh yeah whatever uh okay so these
[12390.86 → 12397.82] guys are what like a charter something Ctrl f dollar sign it is expected to enter service in 2025 and
[12397.82 → 12402.94] comes with a list price of 78 million okay that seems these guys seem maybe somewhat credible I don't
[12402.94 → 12410.62] know though that's that's all I got I've never actually contacted bombardier yet what I have done is
[12410.62 → 12417.42] wear this that was interesting today wow the heck was that I walked through that shoot I just don't ask
[12417.42 → 12427.02] questions any more one of the new writers flashed one of the new writers that's what we call some ideas
[12427.02 → 12435.58] so we call company perks uh all right up next bonus has no reaction hey limes long and don I've been
[12435.58 → 12443.18] hearing a little about PMI cable that's being developed in China to replace the USB standard any
[12443.18 → 12449.74] thoughts thanks in advance I thought it was a display cable HDMI replacement uh google about
[12449.74 → 12458.30] this earlier HDMI display port and USB replacement so cool uh it sounds super cool um yeah this is the
[12458.30 → 12464.22] I'm pretty sure we actually talked about this on LAN like quite a while ago yeah we did so there's type b
[12464.22 → 12471.42] with the proprietary connector 480 watts 192 gigabits per second and then there's the one that uses the USB
[12471.42 → 12481.90] connector but USB has so much inertia like i just I don't I don't I don't see it um
[12483.34 → 12489.82] Chinese over 50 Chinese member companies including Huawei sky worth hi sense and TCL like okay, but you are
[12489.82 → 12496.30] actually going to need companies outside of China to sign on to this thing if you want it to be a global
[12496.30 → 12504.54] standard and man it would suck if Chinese tech had its own like standard for how things plug in
[12504.54 → 12507.90] that just like didn't work anywhere else in the world that would be a downer
[12511.02 → 12517.26] like how could I buy my giant TCL TV from China for like nine thousand dollars less than the one that
[12517.26 → 12522.22] I would have to buy in North America if it used a different display interface Luke and think of
[12522.22 → 12527.98] think of the spoiled overgrown children won't somebody please think of them
[12532.38 → 12541.02] a bombardier is um how are the other colours of cargo pants coming along I don't know
[12543.18 → 12549.98] were you even doing that picture of that dude that uh died his I did that was it actually looks
[12549.98 → 12553.90] perfect yeah it looked awesome hold on
[12560.38 → 12560.86] here it is

[12617.34 → 12622.54] um I don't think I have a great voice for it personally but I would love to do it oh better than
[12622.54 → 12628.78] mine I don't know um you could be one of those like sidekicks like you could do a clap trap or something
[12628.78 → 12637.90] why are you mean what did I do to you today I think that's actually just a fireball offence to
[12637.90 → 12644.54] to say that that's so mean you might as well call me jar I was going to say there are characters that
[12644.54 → 12649.66] have you didn't write them you didn't write them it's not your fault
[12649.66 → 12660.14] um yeah I would love to yeah I don't I don't know what kind of I don't know probably something
[12660.14 → 12667.18] angry I have no idea down for whatever though would be great I hope it happens someday I've
[12667.18 → 12671.66] thought about trying to do like an audiobook at some time I thought that would be kind of neat um
[12671.66 → 12680.46] film two multiple times I have uh thought that I would, it was going to happen even going as far as
[12680.46 → 12685.66] shooting apart um but I'd never it's never happened I don't even need to be paid it would just be kind
[12685.66 → 12691.98] of fun to be like the yep you know the like tech guy who you know goes to try to fix your computer
[12691.98 → 12696.46] and is like sorry it's busted you know whatever like or I don't even have to say the line I don't
[12696.46 → 12700.46] even have to say the line you could just like I could be standing behind the counter in like a geek
[12700.46 → 12705.10] squad alike, and you could hand me your laptop and I would just turn around and take it into the back
[12705.10 → 12711.18] or something I'd be so down for a bit part you people are suggesting that I do this I don't know
[12711.18 → 12717.34] why you should uh you should consider an audiobook version of the abc's of gaming oh that's kind of
[12717.34 → 12722.06] cool it hasn't really sold that well though especially recently I don't know if I don't know if it would
[12722.06 → 12729.58] be I don't know if enough people care it'd be cool though be kind of neat oh yeah here we go uh
[12729.58 → 12734.70] cargo pants two new colours um q126
[12737.18 → 12740.62] that's the plan but nothing's a guarantee when it's like four months away
[12743.34 → 12749.42] hey Wanda DLL how's the tactics run going just wrapped up my hundred percent achievement run and
[12749.42 → 12757.66] loved every second of it nice uh I'm on tactician and I'm stuck on the fight with what's his nuts with
[12757.66 → 12766.30] the stupid ice gun that is the second before the last and I think that I'm feeling pretty down about
[12766.30 → 12773.74] it because I screwed up and I got a couple of my flame shields broken and so my plan was to use my
[12773.74 → 12782.06] calculator to just cast fire on everyone and use that to heal up my side and then also nuke the other
[12782.06 → 12788.14] side and just kind of cheese it that way but because I lost like two of my flame shields in one
[12788.14 → 12792.94] of the previous encounters I don't have enough of them for the rest of my squad so I've played a couple
[12792.94 → 12800.30] times and gotten my butt absolutely handed to me because on tactician every opponent gets super juiced up
[12800.30 → 12808.78] hp and damage and I get nerfed damage and so all these like stupid dragons just rip through me like
[12808.78 → 12815.34] basically everyone's a one hit sometimes like one hit on multiple of my guys and then
[12816.06 → 12822.22] jack ass with the stupid ice gun just disables my guys and does whatever he wants from across the map
[12822.22 → 12827.02] so i just I don't think I'm equipped properly which means I have to go back like two fights I have to
[12827.02 → 12832.38] lose two fights where it's two or three fights worth of progress and then like go back to the shop and
[12832.38 → 12836.30] grind some stuff and then go back so I'm I'm a little stuck right now but
[12838.78 → 12841.02] maybe I can find a way to cheese it I'm not sure
[12843.26 → 12850.14] love the look of the new hoodie Anna 117 what's your thoughts watched much content about it, I'm
[12850.14 → 12855.34] really looking forward to it, I haven't I haven't played the demo I haven't watched much content I'll
[12855.34 → 12859.58] play it when it comes out but I've been I've been playing Final Fantasy tactics recently
[12861.18 → 12868.38] beep bop book aside from CPUs and headphones coming soon what other labs categories might be
[12868.38 → 12873.58] coming eventually and will labs do articles testing for certain items outside these categories
[12873.58 → 12883.66] regularly uh we already do labs articles outside those categories, and we will
[12886.62 → 12892.14] doing labs articles specifically within the categories that we support is not a goal of labs articles at all
[12892.14 → 12898.78] um it's its also not a goal to not do articles about categories that we do support we just do
[12898.78 → 12903.74] articles when we think it makes sense to do articles um if we're inspired to ask a question or something
[12903.74 → 12910.14] is particularly interesting we'll make an article for it that's it um in regard to future verticals
[12910.14 → 12914.62] beyond the ones I've already said are coming I don't really want to commit to those because plans could
[12914.62 → 12923.90] change uh we'll try not to overpromise and under deliver on labs yeah yeah again um but yeah yeah
[12923.90 → 12928.78] sorry I know that's somewhat of a non-answer I am very excited about this stuff and there's been some
[12928.78 → 12935.58] really, really cool progress made i just really don't want to overpromise we've been burned pretty hard by
[12935.58 → 12943.18] overextending on labs and our goal is to uh stay the course stick to the original vision which is to have
[12943.18 → 12950.22] data backed very entertaining tech content across many channels that is still the direction for the
[12950.22 → 12958.30] company um, but we're just going to have to your know instead of doing it out in public where you know our
[12958.30 → 12965.34] our attack surfaces are larger uh we're just kind of doing it a little more quietly
[12965.34 → 12974.22] hey LLD using that discounted gift card now instead of saving it thoughts on YouTube making
[12974.22 → 12979.90] greater than two times playback speed a premium only feature seems kind of silly to me, but maybe it's a
[12979.90 → 12984.54] bandwidth thing I think it's more that it's a thing that most people don't need
[12986.94 → 12992.62] um and so if you're one of those special snowflakes that needs this like super super superfast playback
[12992.62 → 12997.50] speed then from their perspective it's like okay well then you can just pay for premium is what I would
[12997.50 → 13003.66] is what I would guess it's the kind of thing that most people would not be up in arms over them paywalling
[13003.66 → 13009.98] so there's they have the flexibility to do it whether that's you know a right kind of logic
[13010.78 → 13016.38] you know I don't know that I leave open for debate, but it's clear that there won't be an overwhelming
[13016.38 → 13024.38] amount of public pressure on them to make this a free feature so they don't have to would be my guess
[13025.26 → 13031.26] yeah um I don't think that it's for bandwidth reasons my reason for that is because if you
[13031.26 → 13037.58] watch a video faster, and you're like min maxing things like that you're probably a YouTube enjoyer
[13037.58 → 13040.54] and if you're a YouTube enjoyer, and you watch a video faster you're probably going to watch another
[13040.54 → 13046.06] video faster and the more videos what you watch the more ads you're served and realistically as much as
[13046.06 → 13053.66] our audience is extremely high population ad block users um during the ad block fiasco there was a
[13053.66 → 13059.66] lot of channels that didn't look like they got affected almost at all um and I think that's probably
[13059.66 → 13071.02] most of YouTube to be honest got me got a bonus at work oh yeah sorry got a bonus at work and am
[13071.02 → 13078.78] treating myself to some LTT merch and a new gaming rig nice early on what was a treat yourself moment
[13078.78 → 13087.66] as a parent I tend to spend more on the kids when I have extra cash uh my oh man probably my most
[13087.66 → 13095.02] exciting and fulfilling treat myself when I was a very early in my parenting days was an NVIDIA shield
[13095.02 → 13102.22] portable which originally was just called which back when I back in those days was just called NVIDIA shield
[13102.94 → 13113.82] uh let me see if I can bring up some images of it um here Linus boom nope not tablet nope not that
[13113.82 → 13118.86] what is this okay hold on
[13123.50 → 13131.10] okay you know what hold on one second I was uh I was at wait yeah we can say where we were in California
[13131.10 → 13137.74] right Luke the one we went to together yeah there's going to be a video hopefully um I was at NVIDIA recently
[13137.74 → 13142.54] and I think it was you I pointed it out to the shipping label on something that was addressed to
[13142.54 → 13149.58] e-n-v-i-d-i-a i thought it was i-n was it okay it was something it had a letter before the n
[13150.14 → 13161.42] yeah yeah yeah I thought that was cute um anywho NVIDIA project shield man look at baby Linus 12 years
[13161.42 → 13169.98] ago look at this thing is so cool android handheld uh this was the first time we saw um
[13169.98 → 13177.18] in-home game streaming using the encoder on your gaming systems GPU to play games at 720p on your
[13177.18 → 13186.86] little handheld android device and I played all the Tomb Raider reboot like the first game on that
[13186.86 → 13191.50] handheld all of it I never got to touch my desktop because I was always dealing with the kids or
[13191.50 → 13197.10] holding a kid or doing something to do with the kid or work because I had a young company too and um
[13197.10 → 13204.14] finding ways to still be able to enjoy the hobbies that you used to have when you have kids is okay
[13204.14 → 13208.46] did I really spend it on myself yes sort of but also only because of the kids otherwise I could have
[13208.46 → 13213.98] just sat at my computer um so that was a treat yourself and then I also treated myself to a really
[13213.98 → 13218.54] nice pair of headphones that I'm actually still using today back in the early days of having kids
[13218.54 → 13226.70] my Sennheiser HD 600s although dms tells me that Sennheiser has made a candidate for me to replace
[13226.70 → 13233.18] them with I haven't tried them yet do you have those yet no I don't have my goodness man I think I tried them
[13234.86 → 13240.78] can't remember I heard they're great looking forward to its price to performance obscene cool
[13240.78 → 13253.98] hello when dot d LL so the same Linus when your sleep schedule is as bad as it's been this week
[13253.98 → 13260.54] how do you re-enter and get back on track asking for me and my very stressed brain um
[13262.14 → 13268.54] you just don't have the luxury of not being on track and I know that's kind of a
[13268.54 → 13274.38] an answer that you don't really want to hear, but it's kind of the same as i I don't know i
[13274.38 → 13281.10] had this conversation very recently at an at an on-site event and um I didn't shake hands with anybody i
[13281.10 → 13286.94] just like fist bumped and um they were just like yeah I don't know i just yeah i I prefer the elbow
[13286.94 → 13290.78] bump or the fist bump too but i just always feel pressured to shake hands and I'm just like yeah well
[13290.78 → 13295.58] there is no getting pressured to shake hands I can't afford to be sick like
[13295.58 → 13304.14] i you I don't have time to be sick I don't have time to have my brain not centred um so what i what
[13304.14 → 13309.26] I do when I'm crossing like large time zone differences is I will, I'll manage my sleep so
[13309.26 → 13318.22] that I do an extremely long day so that when I get to where i am wiped at bedtime and then um
[13318.94 → 13322.46] you set an alarm you don't have a choice you have to get up in the morning you make sure you spend
[13322.46 → 13329.42] time outside exercise is perfect and that's it there just isn't another option and um
[13331.34 → 13336.22] I'm sorry that's uh that's the best answer I have because it's not fun I don't want to do it
[13338.30 → 13345.66] but for so many years like if I'm sick or I'm out of commission um like even man when I came back
[13345.66 → 13350.62] from Asia just now I technically had like two days booked off but like I ended up working a lot of
[13350.62 → 13357.34] them because I just don't really have that luxury so I still timed my sleep so that I would be up
[13357.34 → 13365.42] during the day the very next day yeah pc master rays says please cover this more there's no more that i
[13365.42 → 13374.70] can really say about it but other than yeah you just gotta you have to be motivated how about you Luke
[13376.30 → 13384.14] what was the core question again oh shoot Dan archived it um how do you get your brain realigned
[13384.14 → 13388.22] after having bad sleeps basically oh
[13393.90 → 13395.98] he wants tips for his very stressed brain
[13397.58 → 13398.86] it makes Luke laugh harder
[13398.86 → 13409.82] yeah uh it's just like i I don't know I don't think I like almost ever have a sleep schedule
[13409.82 → 13415.26] that's like even sort of reasonable so it's just sort of a constant state I try to do the best I can
[13416.94 → 13424.06] it feels like every time that I'm on a perfect streak I just get destroyed by something that there
[13424.06 → 13431.74] was like no way I could foresee and no way I could avoid other than just deeply shirking responsibilities
[13431.74 → 13438.38] which I'm not going to do um yeah he'd never sleep past like a flight departure time or anything
[13439.02 → 13444.86] it's been a long time it's true it's actually been a long time it's actually true um I don't know what
[13444.86 → 13450.30] was going on back then man I would sleep through so many alarms it's not really it is a problem still
[13450.30 → 13458.30] but it's very, very rare, and it used to be like horrible um yeah I don't know you just kind of get
[13458.30 → 13467.50] through it obviously you'll be rough that day um try to not let it chain the biggest thing for me is
[13467.50 → 13473.34] don't let it happen two days in a row don't have a terrible sleep two days in a row because I can
[13473.34 → 13479.02] often tank one day of it but the second it chains even once it's like a huge problem um
[13480.30 → 13487.18] yeah I don't know and understand that you are operating almost certainly at effectively a lower
[13487.18 → 13493.02] IQ when you're like significantly lacking oh yeah um dude I mean they see it on wan show once in a while
[13493.02 → 13502.38] with both of us yep we get like actually real kind of dumb yep it's its and that's like just obviously
[13502.38 → 13509.26] not a good thing in any scenario so like just try to avoid it it's its an it's a problem for me, i
[13509.26 → 13514.78] don't know actively I don't know I think we should have more paint and lower our IQs i i i I don't know
[13514.78 → 13520.06] I think I've talked to you about this but i I genuinely think that kind of dumber people seem happier in
[13520.06 → 13527.58] general oh no that's a proven like they just seem like they don't have the burden of understanding
[13527.58 → 13533.34] what's going on and uh it seems like it's just kind of easier for them to just chill and be kind of
[13533.34 → 13539.82] happy yeah I'm happy for them but not really because I understand what's going on
[13545.26 → 13554.94] uh all right what's next hi LLD what Dodd you think about the android XR and great video with Luke and
[13554.94 → 13561.34] the vision pro I don't know man it feels like Samsung just will desperately clone anything that
[13561.34 → 13566.86] apple makes no matter how stupid it is like the vision pro was such a colossal commercial
[13566.86 → 13571.74] failure that I'm surprised they even bothered to bring the android XR to market but um
[13573.58 → 13582.62] yeah good luck with that dear LLD oh wait wait no hold on I thought this was the galaxy SSR
[13582.62 → 13590.78] hold on android XR you mean the operating system for it yeah I think it was separate
[13590.78 → 13597.50] from the VR thing oh sorry okay as for android XR I don't I've never tried it I've never actually
[13597.50 → 13603.58] tried it I just thought it was hilarious that apple made a product that nobody really wants and
[13603.58 → 13610.38] then immediately Samsung had to make one it just some things never change the more they change, the more
[13610.38 → 13619.26] they stay the same I also want to say i i did see the comments on my video and i it i
[13619.26 → 13628.38] appreciate a lot I read all of them um I still think it's strange that people care that much but i
[13628.38 → 13634.14] appreciate if it's it was heartwarming because i and you just said you thought the video was good i
[13634.14 → 13638.94] thought the video was bad I was expecting it to get trashed and then everyone was like oh that's
[13638.94 → 13645.82] cool so that was no I think just as a VR enthusiast who hasn't really played around with the vision pro
[13645.82 → 13651.98] much it was really cool to hear your perspective like i you watched it i I watched about the first
[13653.18 → 13656.70] four minutes and I was like yeah this is chill and then I was done reading comments by then
[13656.70 → 13663.50] so then I moved on but I liked the vibe it was good it was just it was good energy
[13664.46 → 13672.30] yeah like it was cool I had fun filming it um and that's the key like that's everything like genuinely
[13672.30 → 13677.50] had a pretty good time filming it which was a little bit surprising to me as well um it felt
[13677.50 → 13684.38] strange for me because I haven't I haven't done short circuits um that was my first actual short circuit
[13684.38 → 13692.46] yeah it's just LTT but like the old style so but so old so like it was like kind of
[13694.46 → 13702.78] familiar but in a weird way where like we i so much i I didn't do that form of LTT for that long I did
[13702.78 → 13708.70] scripted for a higher percentage of my oh you've been making it yeah, but then you started doing short
[13708.70 → 13714.22] circuits I don't know it was weird it like it felt familiar but uh like I was doing something wrong at
[13714.22 → 13719.42] the same time if that makes sense like i as I was talking about things I was like man I should be
[13719.42 → 13723.90] more prepared for this I should like have used this for a while and then I had to keep reminding myself
[13723.90 → 13730.22] like no, no that's the point of the channel yeah yeah, but it's like it was weird yeah
[13732.62 → 13739.74] yeah anyway dear LLD Linus is a retired professional painter what is the correct surface
[13739.74 → 13747.90] finish of paint I should get egg gel or satin for striped paint uh okay so I had to look this up it
[13747.90 → 13756.06] turns out striped paint is a meme and I'm getting debated I'm very confused r slash explain the joke
[13756.06 → 13762.30] striped paint is a non-second nonsensical product that doesn't exist so very funny um but yeah there
[13762.30 → 13772.06] would be no way to do this that is not a thing um good try but I'm not triggered only a little just a
[13772.06 → 13779.10] little bit could you alternate finishes between the stripes um if you were taking this more
[13779.10 → 13784.94] seriously I mean yeah you could like I could see if it would actually give you kind of cool effect
[13784.94 → 13790.62] because you'd have it would make the flatter one look more like it's kind of in the background and then
[13790.62 → 13794.22] the glossier one would look like it kind of pops a little bit more, and it would catch the light a
[13794.22 → 13801.98] little bit more so you could do that what about checkered paint um Dan tartan paint what are you
[13802.54 → 13810.38] tartan what does tartan even mean is that a sauce for fish tartan paint what am I looking at here
[13812.06 → 13817.42] he gets what it's an it's a pattern what is this an English thing r slash no, no okay tartan
[13817.42 → 13822.54] is just given a tub of red paint with tartan written on the lid tartan is just a pattern the
[13822.54 → 13825.66] apprentice gets a licking for shaking what
[13829.34 → 13835.02] oh like on a like on a Scottish kilt that's that's the pattern yeah tartan paint
[13835.02 → 13842.46] what is all these like paint memes I wasn't even Memling with that one uh anywho the last one I've got for you
[13842.46 → 13850.86] I'm tired too hey DLL question for Linus what's one decision leg made that you didn't like but
[13850.86 → 13855.18] ultimately proved to be good in the end um
[13859.90 → 13866.70] didn't like I mean what I didn't like I can think of at least one okay hit me
[13866.70 → 13873.74] you're not going to like it well I mean, but it ended up being good in the end though I think so okay in
[13873.74 → 13881.82] my opinion yeah hit me not using go SLR's on when oh okay in the end is doing a lot of heavy lifting
[13881.82 → 13887.34] here though because in the interim it would have been pretty great for a long time that we had a
[13887.34 → 13892.30] lot of audio issues that could have been solved through it while we perfected this system you got
[13892.30 → 13897.66] to learn things dude yeah I can't even remember what you had in here before oh my god it was a
[13897.66 → 13901.82] nightmare it was some eight channel something oh god it was a nightmare like a laptop
[13901.82 → 13907.74] on a cart it worked for one week and then like they came and like helped us set it up and that was
[13907.74 → 13912.78] really great, and it was awesome, and it worked, and then it didn't work ever again because I am too dumb
[13913.34 → 13921.90] to fix it basically that's the fix it either that's yeah well when shows curse dude yeah it was
[13921.90 → 13927.58] cursed I got rid of the goats I got rid of the comments yeah the dan operating it seems to
[13927.58 → 13933.74] be working which is great but I like i i would go home back when I was streaming and stream
[13933.74 → 13938.30] a bunch the entire week and never have an issue ever just click go live and everything would work
[13938.30 → 13944.38] perfectly and then I'd come to work, and we try to do land, and it would never work and I would try to
[13944.38 → 13950.30] fix it as the person who streamed all week no problem and could never fix it is didn't matter we
[13950.30 → 13954.86] could replace the entire system replace all the auto replace the entire computer yep all the software
[13955.74 → 13960.70] reinstall everything to be fair I think the ghosts moved to Sebastian's workstation
[13961.34 → 13966.70] we've changed it many times yeah have you have done you see the picture of his like teams
[13967.26 → 13976.38] uh no like the teams icon on his uh taskbar was upside down which I didn't even know was a thing that was
[13976.38 → 13984.62] possible hmm oh I don't know if he's Memling on me but like ghosts yeah at what point are you just
[13984.62 → 13991.50] getting trolled I don't think I don't think he has the bone in his body to do that but wow that that poor
[13991.50 → 13994.54] man, so 10 years of ghosts went over to him
[13997.34 → 13997.82] all right
[14000.30 → 14006.54] I think that's it for this week we will see you guys again next week same bad time
[14008.38 → 14012.78] maybe a little earlier next week could we manage a little earlier next week we can definitely
[14012.78 → 14017.58] manage a little earlier next week lets uh let's do it for that same bad channel bye
[14021.26 → 14024.22] seriously that's the one there war NT
[14028.14 → 14039.18] it's so lonely
