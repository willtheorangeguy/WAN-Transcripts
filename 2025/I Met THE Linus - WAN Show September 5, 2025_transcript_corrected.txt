[0.00 → 17.90] What is up L's and G's and oh welcome to the WAN show we have a great show lined up for you guys
[17.90 → 22.70] this week I had just about the most exciting freaking phone call of my life I have told Luke
[22.70 → 30.90] basically nothing about it, but I had about a 25-minute conversation with the Linus Torvalds
[30.90 → 39.98] and there's so much more because I have some exciting news to share about the outcome of that
[39.98 → 48.34] conversation I don't want to get ahead of myself, but it looks like something might be happening
[48.34 → 59.24] in other news this week okay valve may have some new VR hardware coming extremely soon, and I am
[59.24 → 62.98] cautiously hopefully optimistic
[62.98 → 70.82] uh you took one of my two, and it was honestly really hard to find those uh silk song is here
[70.82 → 77.70] and it's been actually crazy I've heard about it from practically freaking everyone so that's exciting
[77.70 → 84.74] and I don't know come on you have to sell them on the exciting show
[84.74 → 91.28] Intel launched the first battle mage based workstation card, and you should be hyped
[91.28 → 97.70] because okay it's cheap the intro forget it which is sick that's good
[97.70 → 121.14] the show is brought to you today by thrum delete me and Squarespace and of course that's alongside
[121.14 → 127.68] our rap partner brand our laptop partner dell and our chair partner secret lab, so I am going to be a
[127.68 → 156.72] I'm going to I'm going to share something with you guys um it was way back in oh man good lord when would this have been I think it was during CES yes during CES I don't know why, but I was suddenly struck with the idea of hey after 17 years doing this why don't I just why don't I just shoot my shot you know
[156.72 → 184.72] see if the OG Linus creator of Linux is like down to do something because I don't know he like appears on camera once in a while and stuff he obviously computes right like yeah why not right we've certainly been aligned at points in the past with respect to how we feel about certain hardware vendors and how they treat our respective industries
[184.72 → 213.72] so there's got to be some synergies there so I'm only going to read my emails verbatim because I don't want to you know leak the DMs or whatever what I know I consider an email that someone sends to me private information uh generally speaking uh so here's what I said here's what I said by the way it's really it's pretty funny watching the AI summary of our thread because it's like Linus proposed a collaboration then Linus said this and Linus said that anyway um
[213.72 → 226.16] um this might be a bit of a long shot, but we've received hundreds probably thousands of requests over the years to do something with Linus and I sent this to basically every email address that I could find
[226.16 → 237.98] here are some rough jumping off points building the perfect Linux machine for Linus Torvalds an April Fool's video where we have him straight-faced host one of our videos and just never acknowledge that it's the wrong
[237.98 → 261.78] Linus uh having him having him react to various Linux missteps that you know I've committed over the years and maybe provide some commentary or advice um I said truthfully I don't have a concept solidified in my mind, but I wanted to put out feelers to see if there's any appetite for any kind of collaboration regards the other tech Linus um
[261.78 → 272.74] I heard back literally uh hold on I'm just trying to find the'm trying to find the time stamps here
[272.74 → 284.88] it was within like minutes though like I was floored I heard back that's crazy, and I'm not going to go word for word but
[284.88 → 295.26] basically it was something to do with Highlander um from 1986 you know that there can be only one right
[295.26 → 298.86] and then I thought you meant I thought you meant our like Guinness World Record for us
[298.86 → 304.34] nope not even a little and then um there was some mention of Mad Max Beyond Thunder dome
[304.34 → 314.86] and the admittedly correct assessment that both had epic music and um I was left kind of going
[314.88 → 324.32] okay so is this an is this a yes is it a no uh how about this tell you what I'm going to assign myself some
[324.32 → 332.50] homework I'm going to watch those films and um so to make sure that I get all the references so since CES
[332.50 → 340.56] I have watched all the original Mel Gibson Mad Max movies I have watched Highlander and a little while
[340.56 → 348.40] ago I reached out again, and I went okay uh I totally get all the references now and uh hey are you
[348.40 → 357.30] interested in doing something and earlier this week I actually got on a call with the man himself
[357.30 → 364.78] and I don't want to promise anything because for a thousand reasons right it might not work out
[364.78 → 369.96] and that might not be anyone's fault and there would be no hard feelings whatsoever you know
[369.96 → 376.12] something isn't really done until it's done and there 's and there's nothing wrong with that
[376.12 → 388.74] but right now it looks like we are going to build an ultimate Linux machine for the
[388.74 → 401.48] Linus Torvalds and okay and and and and he will help build it we will have him here in the studio
[401.48 → 407.28] i almost wonder like if you should put like rainbow cards in it like if you should have
[407.28 → 416.24] an NVIDIA and intel and an AMD GPU uh you can like for work reasons my goal would be to
[416.24 → 423.02] would be to make it as stable because I know that that's something that he values a lot like
[423.02 → 427.42] we'll almost certainly be using ECC memory for instance because that's something he's really
[427.42 → 434.26] quite passionate about from what I've seen in the past um cool so i I want that no I want this to be
[434.26 → 440.48] quite a serious I want to have some fun obviously that's what we do right we're going to have some fun
[440.48 → 447.94] but I want the machine to be serious and what I want from you guys and Dan I'm actually not sure
[447.94 → 453.02] necessarily what the best way for us to tackle this is uh maybe what we could do is uh we could
[453.02 → 458.52] do a float plane post uh sometime over the next week or two I want to get some feedback from the
[458.52 → 464.36] community because oh interesting this is a super rare opportunity and obviously the whole point of the
[464.36 → 471.58] video doesn't have to be here's how to put a memory stick in a Linux computer right like it, I don't
[471.58 → 476.16] think that's what people are going to be watching this for no I want to like I want to have I want
[476.16 → 483.12] to have a conversation you know Linus a Linus you know chatting about our very
[483.12 → 489.34] different experiences and our very different sort of approach to the tech world um there are some
[489.34 → 495.64] parallels we've both ruffled some feathers over the years yeah, yeah so I want to know like what
[495.64 → 502.66] would you guys because to me building a computer opposite someone is its almost it's almost not
[502.66 → 507.44] the point right it's more like it's more like a hot one it's an excuse to be in the same room at the
[507.44 → 517.22] same time right sparky ones dude though I am like amazed at how easy it was to get him on the show
[517.22 → 525.88] he was just like oh yeah that sounds fun let's do it I like I thought I'd have to grovel uh i i I offered
[525.88 → 531.96] to bring the whole production to him, and he was like no, no i I think I could do that I could just
[531.96 → 539.02] come up there and I was like okay that's incredibly generous of your time um I know this is a little
[539.02 → 547.18] premature yeah um but i I hope it goes so well that like he wants to do something again i i I think this
[547.18 → 553.20] is really cool I think it's so cool I think it would be awesome, and it's its one of those things
[553.20 → 562.66] where just like i just never asked because I assumed yeah i I just assumed I don't know i the
[562.66 → 568.88] answer would be no and i I think I don't know, and maybe it's like an insecurity on my part
[568.88 → 575.72] uh maybe it's just maybe I've allowed my perception of myself to be coloured the same way that I think
[575.72 → 581.90] some people do as sort of like the the tech clown like i yeah he drops stuff he does
[581.90 → 590.62] this he does that i I don't know I don't know I don't know why i I thought he'd say no or ignore
[590.62 → 598.58] it i I didn't think he'd necessarily even get my email but like that part's kind of surprising to me, i
[598.58 → 605.38] think i think for me, it's its not my perception of you it's just that like he's been
[605.38 → 615.18] I don't know I don't know how to say this and not sound uh like I'm grovelling, but he's kind of been
[615.18 → 621.88] like a somewhat of a godlike figure forever uh in like our realm so it's just kind of crazy so
[621.88 → 627.42] you're going to have to you're going to have to sort of dial that back when he's here no I know because
[627.42 → 634.54] what I will say is he doesn't seem to get it like what a rock star and that's not something you like
[634.54 → 641.44] ever really say to somebody's face what an absolute freaking rock star he is in our community because
[641.44 → 645.78] like yeah I was like dude you're going to have to I like I tried to prepare him a little bit I was like
[645.78 → 651.68] dude you're going to have to understand that like there 's's going to be people in our office that
[651.68 → 658.56] are like oh I'll chill I'll chill I'll be fine it's so great to meet you sir like its good yeah and
[658.56 → 666.02] he's like oh I mean I'm like dude understand you are beloved in our space, and he's like oh i I don't
[666.02 → 670.80] know I mean not everybody likes me I've I've ruffled a lot of feathers I've been very outspoken I'm like sir
[670.80 → 676.62] you have to understand the way that you are outspoken and the cause that you represent
[676.62 → 687.64] it's very aligned with our community yeah you've got some fans here yeah definitely so I think he
[687.64 → 697.00] might end up a little taken aback by just how much our community in particular is going to be like
[697.00 → 705.78] no way well I mean I think there's also been a very large push um I know I've been talking about
[705.78 → 710.52] individually a little bit but I think honestly that's largely because of the communication in
[710.52 → 716.06] our community for a while but there's been a really large push of people trying to kind of flee over to
[716.06 → 724.00] windows lately um I think largely enabled by steam OS sorry flee over to window you mean flee from
[724.00 → 729.20] windows no flee away from windows is what I meant to say yeah okay I was like what are you talking
[729.20 → 737.92] about bud no yeah fleeing from windows fleeing away from windows um and that's like man the fact
[737.92 → 747.34] that it's even a possibility is kind of wild to go to an open source option uh yeah is crazy
[747.34 → 754.52] considering there's effectively two right um, and they're both just like enormous commercial giants
[754.52 → 760.88] so the fact that there's a genuinely perfect alternative um that is like free and open is
[760.88 → 769.06] nuts yeah I mean tons of credit tons of credit to valve for the support that they've given
[769.06 → 776.76] um and tons of credit of course to the foot soldiers the ones that are out there doing the work
[776.76 → 783.62] uh to make this happen because it has been arduous um and i I mean i
[783.62 → 790.08] you wouldn't have to go back that far for me to say yeah this is never going to happen
[790.08 → 796.66] like even valve looked like they gave up after the original steam machines flopper
[796.66 → 803.12] and clearly they didn't which is great but yeah it seemed like they did for a bit really did
[803.12 → 811.76] uh legacy uprising says there are only three OGs and two I couldn't care less to see on the show
[811.76 → 819.36] there's Bill Gates Steve Jobs and the only open source one Linus it's like yep yeah i think
[819.36 → 825.48] that's a sentiment that's going to resonate with a big part of our community which isn't to say at all
[825.48 → 831.98] that the contributions to modern computing for better or for worse from the other two were not
[831.98 → 837.36] monumental absolutely they were no one is questioning that no one's denying that
[837.36 → 845.12] but in terms of like you know if I was to pick a big three sort of figureheads because again
[845.12 → 852.54] a big part of their roles was to be figureheads or is to be figureheads it's not like it's not like
[852.54 → 857.84] any of them was you know sitting developing everything over the entire span of their
[857.84 → 863.54] in some cases decades long careers right like uh there are many contributors to to to
[863.54 → 868.06] every major platform but in terms of like if I was going to pick a big three figureheads yeah those
[868.06 → 875.06] would those would be them for me too yes we're not forgetting the laws don't worry chat don't worry
[875.06 → 882.46] we're not forgetting Steve Wozniak now was somebody that I think would be fantastic to be had
[882.46 → 890.02] on the show um I mean look let's start let's start somewhere let's start somewhere and then if this
[890.02 → 896.42] goes really well dude I mean how fun would that be that'd be sweet yeah that'd be super cool but let's
[896.42 → 901.84] start somewhere because it never hurts it never hurts when we do outreach you know to other
[901.84 → 907.42] people to be like okay and here's the time that we had you know Linus Torvalds on um
[907.42 → 913.74] and it went great or I don't know maybe it didn't go so good no I'm I'm sure I think it's
[913.74 → 919.98] going to go awesome yeah yeah um I'm just I just wanted to I'm too excited to not share that with
[919.98 → 926.36] you guys this week this is the kind of thing where if I wasn't so amped about it to the point where I'd
[926.36 → 930.90] probably end up leaking it anyway um then I would have saved and I would have just had it be a surprise
[930.90 → 939.86] when the video dropped but i just really wanted to talk about it and I'm I'm psyched I'm
[939.86 → 945.82] absolutely psyched and yeah Dan I don't know maybe could we coordinate with Sammy to get some to get
[945.82 → 951.84] some jumping off points for some conversations that people would like to hear 100 okay that would
[951.84 → 957.62] be amazing so that'll be over on float plane leg.GG slash float plane if you're not part of our
[957.62 → 965.32] our legion of float planers just quite yet uh speaking of legions of float planers I guess now
[965.32 → 973.74] is as good a time as any to head into our next topic um last week i it was a relatively short
[973.74 → 979.68] conversation I thought, but we discussed a little bit of what's been happening on the channel with
[979.68 → 985.08] respect to viewership uh there were some theories that we kind of threw around on the show last week
[985.08 → 993.90] um since that time we have done some additional digging and I wouldn't say that we have an answer
[993.90 → 1000.94] but we definitely have a lot more questions and uh I guess I'm going to have to kind of bring producer
[1000.94 → 1006.96] Dan into the conversation for this because he's one of the ones that's been doing a fair bit of the
[1006.96 → 1013.72] investigation on our side so um we've kind of we've chatted a little bit with YouTube about it but
[1013.72 → 1025.96] in typical YouTube fashion the answer is pretty much get good yeah which to be clear is fair and is a valid
[1025.96 → 1034.78] stance like if there is an algorithmic shift that means that yeah you know a 0.2 or 0.4 difference in
[1034.78 → 1040.70] click-through ratio means that hey your packaging just isn't good enough for the modern meta anymore
[1040.70 → 1046.00] or if there's a shift where established channels can't just take for granted that they're going to
[1046.00 → 1051.72] get a certain number of impressions, and they're going to have to get scrappier and fight for
[1051.72 → 1055.96] every viewer you know just like they did in the early days that's that's a valid answer and that's
[1055.96 → 1063.48] one that I can that I can totally accept but Dan did dig up some things, and we did see some feedback
[1063.48 → 1069.84] from other creators both publicly and in our inboxes that would lead us to believe that it isn't
[1069.84 → 1077.46] quite, quite maybe not quite that simple so Dan do you want to talk a little bit about sort of maybe
[1077.46 → 1083.44] let's go chronologically so start with what you sort of discovered right after wan show that we were
[1083.44 → 1089.92] kind of chatting about on Teams afterward yeah absolutely um yeah we had a pretty brutal chat
[1089.92 → 1094.66] after wan show I think all of us here are pretty concerned about this downturn in viewership like
[1094.66 → 1101.28] we're seeing maybe a 50 viewership drop so we went from one and a half two million views per video to
[1101.28 → 1108.60] down to like a million so like huge drop I mean less than that for that one in particular
[1108.60 → 1115.22] exactly sometimes down to 300 000 I think that one still has like 400k or something like that even
[1115.22 → 1121.66] loads been up for over a week yeah something 500k 500 7 000 yeah something like that so I thought this
[1121.66 → 1129.20] was pretty weird because in general if our videos were just getting worse um like we were just losing
[1129.20 → 1136.00] it uh we should be seeing like a downward trend, and you know maybe we are getting bad maybe
[1136.00 → 1141.70] that's a component of it too but I built a tool to pull all of our videos that we've ever made
[1141.70 → 1148.36] so that's roughly 6 900 or something like that nice and one thing that I've also pulled was all
[1148.36 → 1153.54] of the likes for those videos too are you able to share any of this on screen or are you just gonna
[1153.54 → 1158.08] i can throw pictures up I'm not sure how much of this you want to show publicly yeah we're we're
[1158.08 → 1163.96] that for better or for worse Dan our transparency is we're we're like we're like panes of glass
[1163.96 → 1171.22] absolutely you know we're transparent, and sometimes we break yeah um yeah so I think we should show
[1171.22 → 1176.80] where we got the tip from too yes that's right well let's go let's go chronological
[1176.80 → 1185.98] sure sure um I will grab some pictures in a minute and if I can't anyway I ran this chart and
[1185.98 → 1195.60] I saw that there was this shift, and it was really, really strange because it was so sudden and we
[1195.60 → 1204.54] hadn't seen many other kinds of I guess creators talking about it at that point yeah, and it was
[1204.54 → 1211.94] also very difficult to find other creators that were presenting similar to we were um I pulled Mr beast
[1211.94 → 1216.74] I pulled Verulamium I pulled a bunch of other channels and I think their upload frequency maybe
[1216.74 → 1221.82] had something to do with their data that didn't look like this but what we found was the views
[1221.82 → 1228.62] were down but the like ratio had gone through the roof so our average like ratio I think was something
[1228.62 → 1235.76] like three percent, and it had skyrocketed before the heads-up what sorry did we know this like ratio
[1235.76 → 1241.20] thing already no this is this was the heads-up yeah okay we have to go chronologically yeah who was that then
[1241.20 → 1250.26] that was Brody oh yeah okay, okay so there was a merch message that came in from a viewer yeah giving
[1250.26 → 1258.10] us a heads-up of uh Brody Robinson um hopefully I didn't say that wrong let me check his channel
[1258.10 → 1261.06] we've engaged with him before um
[1261.06 → 1268.54] and Fleming says Brody yeah I watched his video yeah Brody Robinson uh so there's a merch message that
[1268.54 → 1274.82] came in flagging that video for us uh so big appreciation a big appreciation to the merch
[1274.82 → 1279.84] message if I remember correctly it was anonymous so that's right I don't know um but that that sent
[1279.84 → 1286.02] us to Brody's video um and then Brody's video talked about this whole you know views going down
[1286.02 → 1292.60] likes going sharply up well revenue going yeah likes not going sharply up but like ratio staying
[1292.60 → 1299.58] constant meaning that if views are down but your likes are the same the ratio of viewers liking the
[1299.58 → 1306.96] content is skyrocketing um and then a pattern as well of revenue also staying constant meaning that
[1306.96 → 1315.00] your CPMs or your amount of money per view um also went yeah that's that's another big thing that
[1315.00 → 1320.50] that I found I think that was a couple of days ago now um I was looking at our revenue numbers because
[1320.50 → 1326.92] okay um are we getting less views if we're getting fewer views we should be making less money every
[1326.92 → 1335.00] YouTuber makes money off of AdSense that should track I did a linear regression on um revenue to
[1335.00 → 1343.00] view count, and it is pretty much perfectly statistically correlated with no outliers um revenue is stable
[1343.00 → 1350.18] around our average it hasn't moved within one sigma from that mean but viewership is down over
[1350.18 → 1359.40] one sigma so like 65 to 98 percent uh kind of outside normal and then like ratio is up by two sigmas so
[1359.40 → 1368.28] it's like everyone who is seeing this I think your views are the same I think they haven't changed and
[1368.28 → 1372.98] you can check your revenue numbers, and you can check your like ratio as well another thing that i
[1372.98 → 1382.10] did is I calculated our revenue per view which is like a kind of CPM that you know we make pm it's
[1382.10 → 1387.38] like a rpm but not the one that YouTube reports YouTube's reported CPM and rpm have no statistical
[1387.38 → 1393.78] correlation to view count at all but if you take the number of views you get and the amount of money you
[1393.78 → 1401.70] you get a like a rpm that number has also skyrocketed by about the same and
[1403.22 → 1409.38] what I managed to do was I calculated our average rpm and then i kind of flipped it around so instead of
[1409.38 → 1417.62] rpm revenue divided by views I did how many views we should have got for this amount of revenue that we
[1417.62 → 1424.02] generated right and what I found is that you know it's a little bit more wonky but the views are
[1424.02 → 1431.22] where they're supposed to be the numbers are you know roughly where they're supposed to be on the
[1431.22 → 1435.54] average which I thought was very strange do you have any of these visuals for the people just yet
[1435.54 → 1440.10] they're going to take me a sec why don't you guys discuss because i have to like screen cap and download all
[1440.10 → 1445.06] these pictures' oh okay I'm so sorry it's been interesting there 's's I was flagged this
[1445.06 → 1453.46] video and in classic fashion uh I haven't watched it and I haven't read the comments oh boy um oh boy
[1453.46 → 1463.78] oh boy here we go it's probably full of furry porn no, no no, no um it's a dark viper video
[1463.78 → 1470.66] um but the released a video 17 hours ago I've been travelling so I haven't been able to watch it
[1470.66 → 1475.46] but he released a video 17 hours ago uh just in quotes saying I guess my retirement is coming sooner
[1475.46 → 1484.18] than I thought um and I've I've heard that it's about this YouTube performance thing that's going on
[1485.30 → 1490.58] so maybe consider checking that out I've seen some other creators talking about it there are some theories
[1490.58 → 1496.02] I believe Brody who really tipped us off on all of this stuff um yeah there are theories that I believe
[1496.02 → 1502.58] he said as well that it might be kind of being a b tested um, so some channels are getting hit by
[1502.58 → 1508.42] whatever this is, and other channels seem to not be um I have talked to other creators that think that
[1508.42 → 1514.98] they've had none of these effects um and I've looked at their results and their overall revenue
[1514.98 → 1520.50] staying kind of flat their like to view ratio staying kind of flat and their overall views are
[1520.50 → 1525.06] staying kind of right where they expected, and then you're seeing other creators where this exactly
[1526.26 → 1532.74] exactly similar pattern is happening where the like to view ratio and the CPMs are just going way up
[1532.74 → 1538.74] and the views are going way down, and it's all on the exact it happened to everybody at like the exact same
[1538.74 → 1544.98] time so it's its really really really hard like we don't know obviously we have no idea, but it's really
[1544.98 → 1550.10] hard to point at this and say like there isn't something going on in YouTube land yeah obviously
[1550.10 → 1556.26] you can always do better sure and there are various theories for how you know something like this
[1556.26 → 1563.46] could happen legitimately uh one of the theories that I've seen is that YouTube could be cleaning up um
[1563.46 → 1572.50] idle autoplay so something that I do know is that an idle view is not worth as much it cannot be monetized as
[1572.50 → 1581.38] effectively as an active engaged view um it's also less likely to result in clicking the like button
[1581.38 → 1590.10] because you're sleeping, or you're otherwise away or idling and so that is a potential hypothesis for how
[1590.90 → 1599.46] a video could perform as expected in terms of the revenue and in terms of the viewer engagement
[1599.46 → 1607.70] but not register nearly as many views or nearly as much watch time um it could also explain why some
[1607.70 → 1615.78] of these very low viewership videos have really great retention and really great user sentiment it
[1615.78 → 1623.46] turns out this is a good video it's just that like nobody's watching it or maybe YouTube is fine
[1623.46 → 1628.98] tuning things so that only people who are actually very interested and very actively engaged are
[1628.98 → 1633.62] watching it that's one theory I've seen so I've got our chart here ready and I'm gonna hold on
[1633.62 → 1637.62] let me finish with the kind of random theories first and then some more yeah as soon as you're ready okay
[1637.62 → 1643.30] um after that um another one is that there's this new feature called I think it's called hype
[1644.18 → 1650.42] that showed up in the dashboard right around that time and I think it has to do with helping to
[1650.42 → 1659.06] promote small channels um so another theory that I've seen is that no the viewer drop is real but
[1659.06 → 1665.54] it is mostly affecting only certain kinds of channels, or it's mostly affecting established channels
[1665.54 → 1672.26] because this hype feature is kind of designed to elevate smaller channels and diversify the
[1672.26 → 1677.54] content on the platform a little bit I think there could be some merit there, but it doesn't really
[1677.54 → 1681.78] back up some of the observations that we've seen within our own dashboard over the last little
[1681.78 → 1689.78] while like after that one video that absolutely dominated the hidden gaming setup in my new
[1689.78 → 1696.98] desk one that still has half a million views which I want to just get this out there most people on earth
[1696.98 → 1702.26] would be thrilled to get half a million views on their YouTube video and that is that that is that's like
[1702.26 → 1708.74] huge I'm not I'm not down on getting half a million views on a YouTube video that's awesome like
[1708.74 → 1713.78] good job if you've ever managed to achieve that I'm just saying that when you have like a hundred staff
[1713.78 → 1719.54] and you've kind of built a model around expecting a certain number of views then that can be
[1719.54 → 1724.26] a disappointment because that could mean that the model is no longer sustainable so that's that's where
[1724.26 → 1731.38] I'm coming from here so right after that one that bombed we had um our worst performing wands show
[1731.94 → 1744.66] in I don't know years um so it was rough yeah last one show was an absolute bomb, but then we had two
[1744.66 → 1751.78] one out of tens in a row and when I say a one out of ten that means that it is the top performing video
[1751.78 → 1756.50] out of the last 10 uploaded to your channel so we had a good thing it sounds like a bad thing, but it's
[1756.50 → 1762.02] a good thing yeah so we had Nintendo's greed could change the industry um that was a one out of ten it
[1762.02 → 1769.06] now has 1.6 million views, and it has a looks like a pretty normal like ratio so I don't know if I would
[1769.06 → 1773.94] believe that it's supposed to have three million views by now, and then we had we're being forced to
[1773.94 → 1780.66] buy chrome books which was a really like back to basics old school LTT filmed on phones completely
[1780.66 → 1785.30] unscripted me and David went shopping for chrome books that was another one at a 10 which also
[1785.30 → 1791.38] like has it's got a good you know like ratio and everything but not an outlier by any stretch of
[1791.38 → 1798.98] the imagination then we had another bomb yesterday and so that unfortunately I think kind of derailed the
[1798.98 → 1804.02] conversation within the community yeah to yeah you guys aren't getting views because your content sucks
[1804.02 → 1809.06] and it's like look i I get it the how many monitors is too many sure you can make the argument
[1809.06 → 1814.74] it sucked um looking back at it now with people's feedback it's like yeah you know what I think our
[1814.74 → 1821.06] ratio of not the ones that got the LG monitor shipped to them could have been better and like
[1821.06 → 1826.50] it probably could have been longer um it just was bad timing we've been internally we've been discussing
[1826.50 → 1832.34] hey how do we get our video links down a little bit, but that was shot before that happened so the
[1832.34 → 1836.58] ratio probably would have been better anyway the point is just it's it spilled milk at this point
[1836.58 → 1844.10] um even with some of the negative feedback around it is the viewership is very, very low but
[1844.10 → 1848.82] it's still not nearly as bad as that hidden desk one was which I think had a better title better
[1848.82 → 1856.18] thumbnail better premise um and was like a real outlier um I really thought that the title
[1856.18 → 1863.86] thumbnail on the desk video was fantastic yeah so okay with all that in mind then I don't know
[1864.58 → 1871.14] what to think other than if they are a b testing something it, it might even not be channel wide i
[1871.14 → 1876.74] mean it might be video to video for all I can tell um and or maybe they just aren't a b testing something
[1876.74 → 1884.26] and maybe those videos just suck and at the end of the day like our action plan just has to be
[1884.26 → 1890.66] make the best possible content we can and upload as much of it as we can that's all we can do um, but it's
[1890.66 → 1895.14] still you know I don't think it hurts to have these conversations so okay Dan you got some visuals to
[1895.14 → 1901.54] show the people i do hopefully they can make sense um and are we okay showing some
[1901.54 → 1907.06] revenue numbers or shall I keep that one out of it yeah I don't care so here is the first one I got
[1907.06 → 1911.94] at the top here we might want to either I will get rid of myself in a sec in the top here we've got views
[1911.94 → 1917.94] and the bottom one here is our no don't do it damn uh the green line in the centre there is our
[1917.94 → 1924.74] average one sigma two sigmas above that you can see like ratio has gone ridiculous and views are down
[1924.74 → 1930.02] too um the next one here no, no put that back up do you have a mouse pointer that you can kind of
[1930.02 → 1937.22] use to really show them the date uh maybe probably not help the people okay fine well basically it's
[1937.22 → 1943.62] let me do that it's around the start of uh august there then that's right where the like to the like
[1943.62 → 1952.26] to view ratio on the top just skyrockets where the low watermark becomes what used to be a high watermark
[1952.26 → 1959.46] right and then right on that same day pretty much you go down to the bottom and view performance goes
[1959.46 → 1968.82] and like some of that can be explained a little bit because if a video is only viewed by the
[1968.82 → 1976.98] super hardcore audience they're more likely to yes uh tap like, but this is this does not explain
[1976.98 → 1984.18] that entirely yeah yeah exactly it doesn't make a lot of sense um there I made a point here
[1984.18 → 1990.66] so yeah as you can kind of see like this is where it kind of starts right in August it all goes a bit
[1990.66 → 1997.86] weird and then if we compare that with all of our videos we've ever made which is this one here so i
[1997.86 → 2005.86] pulled all 6 000 you can see right at the end here this goes up most of it's just like noise for the
[2005.86 → 2011.22] entire history of the channel, and then it just goes and then same here it just kind of drops down to
[2011.22 → 2016.18] nothing um and there are some there are definitely some outliers over the years when
[2016.18 → 2024.26] there are days that have like a spectacular like ratio um but those if you go, and you drill
[2024.26 → 2030.58] down into them what you're going to find is things like the uh the brand uh sponsored video where we
[2030.58 → 2038.10] just like uploaded that video of brand trolling me that has a phenomenal like to view ratio or ones where
[2038.10 → 2044.66] you know Elijah said hey if we get 100 000 likes I'll, I'll make this weird hope poster uh with CEO
[2044.66 → 2050.26] Tarzan tong which we did get, and we did have to make um so those are some of the outliers that you guys
[2050.26 → 2057.94] are seeing there um everything else is pretty much our typical you know way of doing things where we
[2057.94 → 2063.30] don't really call out the like button super hard our content i I wouldn't, I wouldn't describe it as
[2063.30 → 2069.14] samey I don't think that's fair but I think it's consistent for the most part another thing that i
[2069.14 → 2077.30] did is um that second wind video that came out got shared around this is their channel and I can see
[2077.30 → 2082.66] exactly pretty much the same thing their like ratio goes insane their views kind of go down I've had to
[2082.66 → 2086.98] correct this one a little bit because they have sort of mini channels right you got Yankee in them
[2086.98 → 2092.10] and there's all those sorts of spikes, but the most of their channel performance is around here
[2092.10 → 2096.50] and then you can kind of see there's a bit of drop off, but that like ratio goes crazy which is
[2096.50 → 2103.30] very, very strange as well if we move on to our revenue here this is from a more recent kind of
[2103.30 → 2110.10] time period, but you can see that the views drop off here, but revenue is still within that 65 percent
[2110.10 → 2119.22] middle band and then our revenue per view goes up like insane like way out of normal um which is which
[2119.22 → 2125.86] is kind of interesting as well um very very very strange uh if you want to see that as a linear
[2125.86 → 2135.54] regression you can kind of see here, so this top one is the provided CPM, so basically yeah like no
[2136.50 → 2139.94] uh absolutely no correlation between
[2142.10 → 2147.46] CPM and views and then the bottom one here is our views to estimated revenue which would kind of tell me
[2147.46 → 2153.46] that our revenue is not being adjusted because we're still getting the same amount of views
[2153.46 → 2157.62] and we're still getting the same amount of revenue or rather we're not getting the same number of views
[2157.62 → 2164.34] sorry yeah yeah um the expected amount of revenue is weird uh this last one here is that kind of flip
[2164.34 → 2173.46] so you can kind of again see on the right-hand side here we've got our um right like these two graphs
[2173.46 → 2180.74] track really closely with each other until suddenly at the beginning of August they decouple
[2180.74 → 2187.54] absolutely, and you do see some slight decoupling but not consistent and if you can think about where
[2187.54 → 2194.26] our numbers are supposed to be which are roughly around 1.5 to 2 million these are there just the
[2194.26 → 2199.06] views are really low some of them are still coupled I don't know what's going on I don't know enough
[2199.06 → 2206.74] but uh that's really strange I've got more uh what's but wait there's more but wait there's more
[2206.74 → 2214.02] um which one is this is dark viper he posted that video today I see the same thing you can see
[2214.02 → 2220.58] his like ratio goes crazy, and his views are down he hits an all-time he hits two what would be all-time
[2220.58 → 2228.58] highs for like ratio in the last month you got to be kidding me right mm-hmm while his views are in
[2228.98 → 2237.38] the absolute toilet at low points for this entire data range it's here yeah like come on man
[2237.94 → 2243.46] another interesting thing that I'm seeing is like the like ratio is super decoupled from views
[2243.46 → 2249.06] initially like you'll have a view that you'll have a video that has 100 000 views, and it has 80 000 likes
[2249.06 → 2255.38] and the likes go up even more like I was tracking the do you want to go back to uh talking heads yeah
[2255.38 → 2261.06] let's probably do that oh um have you really seen it that bad 100 000 views 80 000 likes that's insane
[2261.06 → 2266.42] yeah the second wind video I started tracking immediately after it got posted and like I was
[2266.42 → 2272.58] looking at the like ratio on that it was within the first hour it had like 40 000 views and like
[2272.58 → 2279.86] nearly 40 000 likes like the ratio for it was just at the absolute top they're lagging and I think
[2279.86 → 2283.70] a couple other channels have mentioned that I think dark viper mentioned that I think somebody
[2283.70 → 2289.06] else did too yeah I saw someone mentioning that they encountered a situation where their internal
[2289.06 → 2297.06] dashboard actually registered fewer views than the external view counter which they said in like
[2297.06 → 2302.42] some number of the big number of years of doing this they'd never seen yeah I've never seen it either
[2302.42 → 2308.58] normally our internal real-time view counter or even the non-real-time internal view counter in the studio
[2308.58 → 2314.26] registers significantly more views than what's visible externally because I think whether it's
[2314.26 → 2318.18] more vetting or whether it's just not updating as frequently because of the load that that would
[2318.18 → 2326.98] put on the external platform um that view counter is not as accurate supposedly as the one that we have
[2326.98 → 2332.34] um in our dashboards yeah I spent the last week or two building a tool to kind of cross-check any
[2332.34 → 2338.50] channel from any time period um likes comments stuff like that everything is consistent but the
[2338.50 → 2344.42] number I don't think any of us are experiencing a lower viewer count or what's happening is we're
[2344.42 → 2351.62] being served to a smaller group of more engaged viewers because if the like count is consistent
[2351.62 → 2358.74] but the like ratio is going like through the roof um I don't know I don't know what it is um but what
[2358.74 → 2365.14] a view is having changed in my opinion or is being tested to change however exactly I have it from
[2365.14 → 2373.30] um someone I would consider to be perfect authority that if that were happening they'd
[2373.30 → 2374.74] know, and they don't know about that
[2377.62 → 2381.22] so well we're not getting less money yeah so I mean
[2382.26 → 2387.14] all right well okay that's a complicated it is a complicated that's a complicated conversation
[2387.14 → 2394.18] though because in the eyes of a sponsor which I'm not I don't know if this has
[2394.18 → 2398.18] happened to us at all but theoretically for any creator on YouTube if they're is they're done if
[2398.18 → 2403.22] they're working with outside sponsors in the eyes of the sponsors you're getting significantly less
[2403.22 → 2408.26] views so if your theory is correct and there are a bunch of theories, and we have no idea which one is
[2408.26 → 2412.50] correct if your theory is correct, and we're actually getting the same amount of views then it's really
[2412.50 → 2419.22] screwing over our ability to work with outside sponsors which will extremely negatively impact
[2419.22 → 2426.66] groups like us which are like larger companies that are quite heavily reliant on that sponsor money or
[2426.66 → 2435.14] hear me out hear me out maybe it won't matter that much because and here I'm going to let me see if
[2435.14 → 2441.14] there's uh let me see if there's a way for me to do this easily okay I'm going to try and show a one week
[2441.14 → 2449.62] view let's go from uh let's go from last Friday to this Thursday I'm gonna kind of show you well oh man
[2450.26 → 2459.86] okay this is oh this is tough so what I was what I'm trying to do is show the oh balls I suck at this
[2459.86 → 2465.22] interface okay there what are you doing I'm trying to bring up my Shopify dashboard so the point that I'm
[2465.22 → 2471.46] trying to make here is that yeah this is not going to demonstrate very well because we actually
[2471.46 → 2475.54] typically have a Friday spike for wan show, and then it lulls, and then it spikes again on Fridays
[2475.54 → 2481.22] so it's kind of cyclical so it's going to look like it is going down but day to day this week uh or
[2481.22 → 2489.14] even last week when we had the like big viewership dip there wasn't a reduction in sales on Ltd store so
[2489.14 → 2495.46] it's possible that the sponsors won't care because our referral rates might seem to Dan's
[2495.46 → 2501.86] point earlier like they're actually skyrocketing so we might have fewer views but way more qualified
[2501.86 → 2508.90] views or impressions or referrals yeah to me, they're more high quality would this change
[2508.90 → 2514.18] how we communicate to sponsors or are we already talking in a conversion rate sense I don't really
[2514.18 → 2519.78] know the business side I don't think it would change anything at least not in the short to medium
[2519.78 → 2526.58] term I mean we a lot of the partners that we work with we've worked with for a very long time through
[2526.58 → 2534.58] good times and through less good times, and you know we try to work with our partners in a reasonable
[2534.58 → 2541.22] fashion where hey if they get a banger of a video that does six million views we don't charge them extra
[2541.22 → 2547.46] for that and in the same vein when they get a dog that gets half a million views you know they don't
[2547.46 → 2553.22] come to us going like I want my money back where's my money back I think they understand that there's
[2553.86 → 2560.02] a certain amount of variability here and if they stick with us, I've we've been such consistent
[2560.02 → 2566.02] performers on the platform for so long that we kind of have to understand each other that it's going
[2566.02 → 2572.50] to come out in the watch eventually um speaking of the wash um unless uh Dan did you have
[2572.50 → 2575.86] some more things you wanted to share with the folks because otherwise we should probably discuss
[2576.42 → 2582.50] the uh probably wearing yeah I don't know um I think if people want to reach out and have me run
[2582.50 → 2589.62] their stats or if you have any more data for me, I would really appreciate that um yeah I guess try and
[2589.62 → 2595.94] try and find me, and we'll, we'll have a look at your channel um yeah blue sky twitter email me I don't
[2595.94 → 2603.86] know we'll figure it out uh product okay yeah let's do it i I actually had I had brought up the uh I had
[2603.86 → 2608.74] brought up one of the bigger Reddit threads on this and I was going to kind of uh dunk on people's
[2608.74 → 2614.74] theories a little bit but I guess it's probably not worth it yeah everyone is wrong yeah basically if you
[2614.74 → 2620.34] think you know the answer and that it's black and white you're wrong you are just wrong you're
[2620.34 → 2626.90] just actually wrong I have charts for that you're wrong um there 's's just there's so get rest
[2626.90 → 2633.06] oh my god there's so much certainty there's so much certainty in this Reddit thread that is just
[2633.86 → 2640.82] utterly misplaced you know well YouTube's video views have been going down for years I have it on
[2640.82 → 2647.38] perfect authority that's not happening um I seriously don't have that's true well okay oh
[2647.38 → 2655.22] one there's one theory is down a little bit from covet era but um you'd be you'd be surprised YouTube
[2655.22 → 2663.94] is going hard YouTube's going strong boys um they're doing better on shorts than TikTok is now which is
[2663.94 → 2669.38] pretty nuts there is one theory that we had actually discussed internally as well and that's uh
[2669.38 → 2674.34] something I've got a bit of an update for you guys on um I think we touched on this last week when
[2674.34 → 2680.82] we felt that the channel was really being cluttered up by members only videos um so uh we've had some
[2680.82 → 2688.42] internal discussions this week about just killing the memberships on YouTube that may move forward um
[2688.42 → 2694.50] right now it is not confirmed we'll definitely keep the ones that are just like emotes and flares and
[2694.50 → 2701.78] stuff like that but the actual members only videos I think may go back to being float plane exclusive
[2702.34 → 2710.74] however um YouTube has asked for sort of uh a little bit of time to figure out if there's something
[2710.74 → 2717.86] that they can do to keep us from just walking away from this feature um because I think what I suspect i
[2717.86 → 2723.22] don't know this for sure but what I suspect is that we aren't the only ones complaining about the way that it's
[2724.50 → 2729.14] embedded in the feed and potentially turning people off of our channel right now when we turned
[2729.14 → 2735.70] memberships on they weren't like this there were a members only videos like tab and kind of like
[2735.70 → 2744.66] a Patreon or float plane or any other kind of off platform service um you would drive people to
[2744.66 → 2750.82] memberships to that tab yourself as a creator you would control how you're calling it out and how you are
[2750.82 → 2757.78] uh how you're promoting it the way that it is now it just seems to be kind of shoved in the face of
[2757.78 → 2765.70] anyone who might have a passing interest in your channel and I think it's um it's really turning
[2765.70 → 2773.86] people off at the moment and that's something that you know no creator I don't think um if they aren't
[2773.86 → 2779.06] supremely arrogant um would be in a position where they want to do you don't want to be turning
[2779.06 → 2784.50] people off of your channel um and not going to lie and I honestly don't think this is like
[2784.50 → 2791.30] flow plane bias because I recommended and supported us not recommended but supported us
[2791.86 → 2799.54] very supportive of it content on YouTube i it has turned me away um this like YouTube exclusives
[2799.54 → 2804.98] being in the main feed has been very annoying for me as a YouTube enjoyer of not just our channel
[2804.98 → 2810.66] but other people's channels as well it is very annoying and it one of the big things that it does
[2810.66 → 2817.78] is it pushes me away from the individual channel and it is gives people I think it can give people
[2817.78 → 2822.66] a sense of FOMO in a good way that converts them to become a member but I think it can give people a
[2822.66 → 2828.26] sense of FOMO in a terrible way especially if that's not something that is part of their budget right
[2828.26 → 2836.90] now you know like just because I think that our behind the scenes team is freaking awesome I think
[2836.90 → 2842.90] the content's really great Sammy kills it that doesn't mean that everyone should spend you know
[2842.90 → 2848.50] five or ten dollars a month to get it like if that's is that's not a manageable amount of money for
[2848.50 → 2854.26] you I mean Luke I don't know if you want to talk about that indicator that you had that times have been
[2854.26 → 2862.90] pretty tough um, but we fully recognize that times are pretty tough out there and the first thing
[2862.90 → 2870.18] that you should cut out is throwing money at your screen if times are tough um and so it's up to you
[2870.18 → 2878.98] really yeah no i no I'm I'm okay with it and sure yeah yeah go ahead sorry so something I've
[2878.98 → 2883.06] noticed, and it makes me sad because I don't want this to be a situation that people are running into to be
[2883.06 → 2889.06] completely honest but something I've noticed is that uh we can check mostly in stripe I'm sure
[2889.06 → 2893.30] it's possible in Braintree but Braintree is really annoying to use for anything uh, but we can check in
[2893.30 → 2900.10] stripe what the error codes are that we're getting for failed payments, and you can look at
[2900.10 → 2906.90] those error codes over time and the error code for insufficient funds is a line that is trending up
[2906.90 → 2913.30] um as like percentage wise the amount of failed payments that are because of insufficient funds is
[2913.30 → 2919.70] rising over time um to the point where like there was one day in particular where there was a lot of
[2920.58 → 2926.10] uh cancellations it seemed like on the platform and I was looking into why, and it didn't seem like there
[2926.10 → 2930.34] was a lot of manual cancellation so I was like oh it's a lot of failed payments and I looked into it and
[2930.34 → 2940.82] it was just an actually somewhat stunning amount of insufficient funds um and yeah just like Linus
[2940.82 → 2948.34] says right like it's its it's and the insufficient funds code is completely discrete from the like um
[2948.34 → 2955.54] yeah uh sorry what's the other one uh rejected or denied yeah denied because denied could be for any reason
[2955.54 → 2961.38] but the insufficient funds one is like for that reason actually there's some there's some backup
[2961.38 → 2968.02] for this in float plane chat hover ship says I work in banking and this is sadly so true dude it's crazy
[2968.02 → 2973.78] and it like i again i I can't stress it enough i I love doing the full plane stuff i I adore the
[2973.78 → 2978.42] full plane team I want to be able to do full plane stuff basically forever I appreciate your guy's
[2978.42 → 2986.34] support I also don't want you going to insufficient funds on a credit card like oh man okay it's just
[2986.34 → 2995.38] it's so destructive to your life um to just carry credit card debt like that um and you know like
[2995.38 → 3000.42] i i I can, I can hope that these are just like really, really low limit credit cards that people have
[3001.38 → 3006.82] or virtual cards low limit because of control or whatever i I can really hope that it's those things
[3006.82 → 3014.50] but the volume of errors that we're getting indicates that it's not that um yeah uh firefighter
[3014.50 → 3021.38] 6122 in float plane chat says I work in insurance, and we are seeing the same issues dude oh it's so
[3021.38 → 3026.74] rough it's so uncomfortable i yeah i I appreciate your support I don't want you in that situation um
[3027.62 → 3033.70] please come back later the exclusives are there all the time so you can come back and see them
[3033.70 → 3040.02] later it's okay yep and I've I've I've said this to people before because we've taken some
[3040.02 → 3046.02] criticism for not having regional pricing right and I fully recognize that you know five us dollars is
[3046.02 → 3051.70] not a reasonable monthly amount if you are uh in India, or you know some parts of South America for
[3051.70 → 3058.26] instance but one of the things that i have said publicly is that maintaining the subscription
[3058.26 → 3066.18] is an amazing way of helping support our channel our development team uh the incredible work that
[3066.18 → 3072.34] our editors and Sammy do on the exclusive content uh not to mention uh you know our other participants
[3072.34 → 3077.14] we had a really great meet the team with Sammy who was featured on actually the last two scrapyard
[3077.14 → 3082.90] wars that just went up this week uh it's a great team and they love getting your support and that
[3082.90 → 3088.66] really does come from the people who maintain their subscription monthly however if it is a
[3088.66 → 3095.22] financial burden on you that is not reasonable don't forget that float plane offers DRM
[3095.22 → 3103.14] free downloads we have that that is that was baked into the platform from day one well it's its per
[3103.14 → 3109.06] creator sorry it was baked into the ability to set that up was baked into the platform from day one
[3109.06 → 3114.58] we have had it enabled from day one we have zero intention of ever removing that so you can always
[3114.58 → 3122.02] create for yourself a pay however much you want tier you could subscribe one month a year so you could
[3122.02 → 3126.82] get effectively you could pay eight percent for float plane, and then you could queue up the downloads
[3126.82 → 3131.86] for everything you missed over the last year dump it all in a folder and watch it at your leisure
[3131.86 → 3137.06] we appreciate your support, but we do not want to drain your bank account that's not what this is about
[3137.06 → 3144.42] yeah there is a rate limit on it yes CWP but over the span of a month I think you should be able to
[3144.42 → 3151.30] grab everything that was yeah and there 's's um there's like uh I haven't looked into it in a
[3151.30 → 3157.30] bit, but there's like uh a GitHub thing for a script for Plex that will download it like just right
[3157.30 → 3162.42] below the rate limit and stuff like that uh we had to do the rate limit thing because people were
[3162.42 → 3167.94] kind of abusing it and so it's just like this is why this is why we can't have nice things yeah
[3169.30 → 3182.26] but we we we are not out to put you guys in financial straits uh okay I think oh yeah Dan was
[3182.26 → 3187.54] there anything else you wanted to share with the people I'm not sure I think it's still developing um i
[3187.54 → 3194.18] would love other channels get their names if um is they want charts if we can cross-reference data
[3194.18 → 3199.06] if we can figure out what's going on that's about it all right cool why don't we move on everyone's
[3199.06 → 3205.78] wrong yeah, yeah pretty much that's about it including us yeah yes but not for long if I have
[3205.78 → 3210.98] anything to say about it oh my god
[3212.34 → 3219.78] Dan's putting the paper on ah yes I'm supposed to explain the merchant messages so once again can't
[3219.78 → 3228.34] emphasize this enough if cash is tight hey wear your existing sweater for another little while okay
[3228.34 → 3235.70] but if it's not check this out our washed crew neck sweater just launched last week and i have to tell
[3235.70 → 3240.98] you people around the office are absolutely loving these they're made with a hundred percent cotton
[3240.98 → 3247.38] with a breathable terry fleece interior that is perfect for the fall, and you can get them at leg.GG
[3248.66 → 3255.86] crew neck also oh look at this we have a deal on magnetic cable management this week you can oh wait I was
[3255.86 → 3260.26] supposed to explain merch messages right so the way to interact with the show we've never been
[3261.46 → 3266.34] really that supportive of the idea of just throwing money at the screen we kind of feel that you should
[3266.34 → 3270.66] get something in return why not some quality merchandise so all you've got to do to send a
[3270.66 → 3276.42] merch message to interact with the show and send a little message there or um get a response from
[3276.42 → 3283.78] producer Dan or have him curate it for me and Luke to discuss later on during after dark is added something
[3283.78 → 3288.66] to your cart on lttstore.com like the new washed crew neck sweater or the magnetic cable management
[3288.66 → 3294.42] deal I'm about to tell you about fill in the merch message field go ahead and place your order
[3295.14 → 3300.50] and it should go through uh we'll show you guys how it works in a second but first I'm just going to
[3300.50 → 3304.90] tell you about the magnetic cable management deal we have this week you can mix and match packs of
[3304.90 → 3312.58] individual components and get 10 off if you buy two 15 off if you buy three 20 off if you buy four
[3312.58 → 3318.98] and 25 off if you buy five or more this includes all arches power bar keys power brick holders and
[3318.98 → 3324.18] cable tie holders so it's the perfect time to add on to the magnetic cable management you already have
[3324.18 → 3329.94] or to try it out if you've never tried it before you can shop magnetic cable management at leg.GG
[3329.94 → 3339.30] slash MCM, and it really is whoops whoops whoops there we go it really is this easy we
[3339.30 → 3345.78] actually did a collab with uh kyle from nitwit last week, and he hadn't tried out MCM and I cable
[3345.78 → 3350.66] managed his desk for him with it, and he was like oh and I was like yeah and the best part is hey that
[3350.66 → 3360.26] cable that we forgot to put in easy easy easy is definitely the best part easy magnets I don't even
[3360.26 → 3367.70] care how they work but my god are they ever outstanding um oh yeah right so one of the
[3367.70 → 3373.62] things that I've been going out of my way to make sure that I show you fine folks is giving some credit
[3373.62 → 3377.54] to the team for the amazing job that they've been doing on our photo shoots lately
[3379.70 → 3387.30] absolutely love it so cool got that like vintage look to it Ariana and Reese I think yep that's who
[3387.30 → 3395.30] we're looking at here sorry I got a very very small picture up there very cool
[3396.82 → 3404.74] and really making the most of uh the side of our warehouse great job guys all right Dan do you
[3404.74 → 3409.46] want to show the folks how a merge message works yeah sure I've got a couple for you here why don't
[3409.46 → 3419.46] we start with this one I only wear jeans when jeans oh my god uh how do I put this never
[3421.38 → 3429.30] jeans are so hard dude and I can't afford Sydney Sweeney to wear my jeans you know apparently that was
[3429.30 → 3436.50] like their most successful campaign like ever sure yeah you should just recreate the ad with yourself oh
[3436.50 → 3443.86] my god yeah if we had jeans I would totally do it i I wish we did more like Memling on topical
[3443.86 → 3450.66] things like i I was I wanted to uh I wanted to talk to the writing team this week and do like a like
[3450.66 → 3456.74] a bit in one of our videos where I like steal a hat or something uh I don't know if you saw the viral
[3456.74 → 3464.02] thing from yeah yeah yeah from the um from the US open but we just we operate on a relatively I think
[3464.02 → 3470.82] self-park has a shorter time between starting to work on an episode and it's airing than we do
[3470.82 → 3475.38] so it's its hard for us to be like on it with the cultural references
[3476.90 → 3480.90] it's maybe not a great thing I look I'm not saying it's a good thing I'm just saying it's a
[3480.90 → 3486.26] thing so it's an it's a little tough for us to do that kind of stuff uh I forget how we got onto this
[3486.26 → 3498.98] right jeans jeans jeans are so personal everything from the rise to the cut to the washed ness to the rips
[3498.98 → 3512.26] or not rips to patches to and the trendiness it goes so freaking fast I think it's just not in the cards for us, I mean
[3512.26 → 3518.10] look we have managed to finally do pants successfully I don't think we had a successful
[3518.10 → 3525.78] pant until the cargo pants that's been legitimately successful not just like it did fine I guess we
[3525.78 → 3530.90] didn't lose money on it right that was the high watermark before, but we now have panted that
[3530.90 → 3537.46] have been successful so who knows you know never say never but never
[3537.46 → 3547.06] and the other one I've got for you here hello the lad the dad and the chad Luke given your
[3547.54 → 3551.94] based opinions on supporting AMD and switching to Linux what are some of your favourite pieces
[3551.94 → 3563.86] of software anything that you find novel or useful hmm uh wow is this incredibly lean well he thinks oh
[3563.86 → 3569.30] oh okay are you good I don't think I necessarily have one a lot of the software that I use is actually
[3569.30 → 3575.46] the same which is one of the reasons why I think the switch has been so easy um like if I want to play
[3575.46 → 3586.50] a game on my laptop I can just play the vast majority of steam games, and it's fine um I use chrome for work
[3586.50 → 3596.10] I use uh zen which is like a Firefox offshoot browser for personal stuff um on my laptop most of
[3596.10 → 3603.54] what I'm doing is communications platforms which teams is terrible on Linux, but it works it's terrible
[3603.54 → 3610.50] all the time so it's really hard to differentiate it that much um uh slack works perfectly fine discord
[3610.50 → 3615.30] works perfectly fine obviously email and a browser works perfectly fine so the things that I do on my
[3615.30 → 3622.18] laptop are fairly limited, and they're all the same um outside that I haven't dived in
[3623.94 → 3629.22] super heavily on the customization stuff which I want to do I just haven't necessarily have the time
[3629.22 → 3636.02] for it yet um I feel like this is such a similar take to what I went through when I did the switch to
[3636.02 → 3644.58] snapdragon where i I went in thinking that I was going to care and over the span of the
[3645.14 → 3651.06] much more than a month I ended up daily driving it I was like oh it turns out i I don't care and most of
[3651.06 → 3656.34] what I do is in a browser these days I could just as easily probably use chrome OS but that in my opinion
[3656.34 → 3664.10] is honestly like a better state like i I'm more excited about the fact that i just kind of like shrug
[3664.10 → 3673.06] off that I'm running it now then um I run arch by the way yeah yeah yeah but like but the fact that
[3673.06 → 3679.38] that is actually totally fine is crazy like it's it was not there was no skill involved I'm not some like
[3680.02 → 3685.94] uh Uber Linux nerd at all but I'm running the like scary operating system, and it's been completely fine the
[3685.94 → 3689.78] entire time and everything I've tried to do has just like worked there's been things that have honestly
[3689.78 → 3695.22] been easier you know how when we did the challenge we were both like stunned at how easy the printer
[3695.22 → 3703.14] was yeah yeah especially considering how hard they are on Windows oh yeah yeah honestly most things I've
[3703.14 → 3711.06] ran into this time have been easier or it's just been in kind of like an inverse to normal fashion
[3711.06 → 3721.30] it's been less annoying um like using Windows 11 these days is there are so many little pop-ups and
[3721.30 → 3727.78] pokes and annoying are you sure you don't want to use edge hey this new file you installed are you sure
[3727.78 → 3732.34] we can't open it in edge do you want this weird notification thing do you want this other garbage
[3732.34 → 3739.78] like anytime I try to do anything it is wants to forcibly take the focus window away to some new thing
[3739.78 → 3743.22] that I don't want, and then it just keeps doing that over and over again it's really
[3743.22 → 3749.30] frustrating Windows firewall randomly started blocking LAN minecraft games just like out of
[3749.30 → 3754.82] nowhere what like it was working fine between my kids computers and then all of a sudden it's not
[3754.82 → 3764.26] and I'm like oh my god who cares I'm sure it was in the name of security or something but oh my god who
[3764.26 → 3769.46] cares I'm just trying to play a video game on a local area network, and they're both set to private
[3769.46 → 3778.18] that's made by you that's made by you exactly, exactly what's the excuse dude there's been
[3778.90 → 3784.58] there's been a persistent bug in Halo Infinite for at least a couple of weeks now that's that's as long as
[3784.58 → 3790.18] I've seen it over where the first time you launch it on a system it prompts you to log in but the login
[3790.18 → 3794.02] is like behind, and you can like click, and it'll be like ding ding like you can tell it's there but you
[3794.02 → 3798.42] have to alt f for the game and then launch the game again, and then it'll show up, and it's like bro
[3799.22 → 3806.34] this is basic if you can't handle having a login screen in your software then don't have one also by
[3806.34 → 3815.70] the way never log me out oh my god who cares never like but also if I'm is I'm like uh global Microsoft
[3815.70 → 3824.58] account logged in to my computer already don't ask right like my god so anyway it's been interesting
[3824.58 → 3832.26] and then when I click yes be like okay yeah if I don't remember if it was after the last Linux
[3832.26 → 3836.74] challenge I think it was but I don't fully remember where I decided I would like to try it on my work laptop
[3836.74 → 3843.38] and then eventually I abandoned that because there was so much tedium of like keeping it running that i
[3843.38 → 3848.58] thought it was lowering even if by a small amount it was lowering my productivity at work and i
[3848.58 → 3855.54] decided that I couldn't do a like personal thing that resulted in the lowering of my work productivity
[3855.54 → 3859.54] if that makes sense it's like one of the main reasons why I use chrome for work is because
[3859.54 → 3863.86] of all the different profiles that I have I find chrome is by far best at managing that
[3864.74 → 3871.30] it's not the like the small individual day-to-day usage of the browser it's its purely just the
[3871.30 → 3876.26] profile management is like amazing, and it kicks the butt of everything else and profile management
[3876.26 → 3880.02] doesn't matter to me too much for my personal stuff because it's one account so it sort of
[3880.02 → 3885.54] solves itself um but yeah I eventually ditched running Linux on my work laptop because it was
[3885.54 → 3891.94] too tedious and honestly legitimately at this point I suspect that I might be more productive
[3891.94 → 3897.14] on Linux because of the amount of time that it just gets out of my way I think if we redo the Linux
[3897.14 → 3902.26] challenge it's just going to be boring it might be legitimately it might be we'll have to like
[3902.26 → 3907.62] we'll have to really pad it out to get you know a 12-minute run time or nine minute run time out of
[3908.18 → 3912.18] just like yeah everything kind of went okay well and like something that might be a little bit
[3912.18 → 3918.26] different is I'm running Linux on my laptop which is a lot lighter use, and again it's a lot of browser
[3918.26 → 3922.50] stuff and whatnot but like I also don't game as much as you used to like I remember that being a big
[3922.50 → 3925.94] challenge for you last time we did the Linux challenge is you were like oh this sucks because
[3925.94 → 3930.90] like I mean if we came out and I couldn't play if we do it once battlefield 6 is out hopefully I'll
[3930.90 → 3938.98] be playing some more of that um yeah is it supported on steam OS I don't know and like silk song is here
[3938.98 → 3944.50] I'm excited about that there are some games coming right now that are exciting um silk song I'm I'm pretty
[3944.50 → 3952.34] sure it's for it yeah but yeah um uh yeah it's its interesting I have something to add to um to Luke's you
[3952.34 → 3959.14] know pieces of software that he likes there we do have an actual series on the channel um called LSD or Luke's
[3959.14 → 3967.22] software discoveries uh two whole episodes from 11 and 10 years ago respectively uh he shows you how to
[3969.30 → 3974.98] simplify your screenshots with push I don't know if push even exists anymore so I don't know share i
[3974.98 → 3981.78] guess and also top five hidden uses for VLC Luke software discoveries episode two wow that one actually
[3981.78 → 3988.58] did like pretty good for that era half a million views not bad it's not too bad yeah because if i
[3988.58 → 3993.78] remember correctly Luke software discoveries never went like that well either so that that considered
[3993.78 → 3999.86] I think that video must have done pretty well imagine being proud of having a Gilda t-shirt partnership
[4002.58 → 4008.82] wow anywho uh times have changed yeah good job but yeah I don't know the final takeaway is honestly at
[4008.82 → 4015.22] this point in time I think if I move my laptop back to windows there would be more tedium involved
[4015.22 → 4020.50] with keeping it up-to-date dealing with its updates dealing with windows getting in my way popping things
[4020.50 → 4027.06] up shoving ads in my face doing those types of things uh then Linux's general just getting out of
[4027.06 → 4033.86] my way I've also found that um like updating arch is this big scary thing uh, and then you install it and
[4033.86 → 4041.62] it's so far for me been like just as easier than Windows update um oh dude it is so annoying
[4041.62 → 4046.02] like you click check for updates, and it's like no updates, and then you click it again two seconds
[4046.02 → 4052.26] later it's like here's a gigantic like service pack level update it's like bro yeah just why isn't
[4052.26 → 4057.14] this downloaded already like you know I've only been doing this for a few months like i I'm sure I'll run
[4057.14 → 4062.98] into something that sucks eventually but um i also just have my data whatever small amount of data that
[4062.98 → 4068.66] I have stored on an extra partition and if I need to reinstall arch I can just do that okay according to
[4068.66 → 4074.82] crystal push does still exist, and they do technically still have a page up but now just hold on a gosh
[4074.82 → 4083.54] darn second here download Windows XP to eight and download iPhone app store literally doesn't connect
[4083.54 → 4092.10] to anything so i i I don't know yeah I think we can move on to share x or honestly these days just
[4092.10 → 4098.58] snipping tool and pasting the image somewhere tends to work um most chat applications could take
[4099.14 → 4103.06] attachments now so okay not a super necessary tool anymore
[4105.70 → 4109.86] want to do another topic what do you want to talk about what do we get here
[4114.18 → 4117.22] what was another one of the title topics have we gone through or not titles the
[4117.22 → 4122.82] show the intel battle mage one we could do that oh boy sure you sound so excited I mean it is
[4122.82 → 4133.14] legitimately pretty cool it is the dual slot low profile arc pro b50 uh has a MSRP of 349 us dollars
[4133.14 → 4138.66] a slight increase from the 299 they mentioned at computer earlier this year which intel blames on a
[4138.66 → 4144.26] combination of memory pricing at tariff risks which uh fair enough to be completely honest sounds
[4144.26 → 4152.82] actually fair I don't uh the beef the b50 features 16 xc2 cores 16 gigabytes of gddr6 memory bandwidth of
[4152.82 → 4162.10] 224 gigabytes per second PCI 5.0 8x interface four mini display ports all at a TDP of just 70 watts allowing
[4162.10 → 4167.38] it to be powered entirely by the PCIE slot which is a feature in this case that will be cared about
[4167.38 → 4174.58] um yeah how much the rest of this do people care about um apparently the b50 performed favourably
[4174.58 → 4183.94] next to the 400 NVIDIA RTX a 1008 gig which was an ampere 2024 release, but it has double the memory
[4183.94 → 4190.02] uh which is pretty cool that you know intel's not keeping out on memory because that's apparently
[4190.02 → 4194.82] something we can't take for granted these days um especially pretty cool right now considering a lot
[4194.82 → 4200.42] of the applications that you're going to want to use thus for are actually very heavily um memory
[4200.42 → 4207.70] bound prior is also a very cool feature to support so essentially this allows it to be split up
[4207.70 → 4215.06] virtualization style like a CPU and shared across multiple VMS if you don't really need uh you know
[4215.06 → 4222.98] high-end 3d performance um serve the home did some initial tests, and it's apparently pretty flippin'
[4222.98 → 4229.70] decent uh also it could be the cheapest way to get av1 encoding in a small form factor case because it's
[4230.34 → 4238.50] dual slot low profile so intel continues to do some super cool stuff on the GPU side just want to shout
[4238.50 → 4248.74] out that the b580 is a heck of a lot of gaming GPU for 260 dollars in stock across multiple skews
[4248.74 → 4259.94] this is two skews in stock 260 and 270 dollars on new egg um you wait whoa hold on a second
[4261.62 → 4268.42] get battlefield 6 and more with purchase what is that real before we dive into
[4268.42 → 4272.58] that just want to say this before I forget john doyen from the lab just messaged me and said that
[4272.58 → 4278.18] the b580 can also game it's not the best but at 75 watts it's actually not bad which is really the
[4278.18 → 4284.26] the b50 b580 is did I say 580 sorry yeah yeah b50 he said b50 i I read it wrong that's my hold on
[4284.26 → 4292.58] is this deal real I'm not sure what you're seeing I'm on new egg right now, and it says you
[4292.58 → 4302.26] get battlefield hold on where is it did i imagine it am i am I crazy this just says free
[4302.66 → 4308.26] free 3d mark test it says additional items until gamer days holy crap you get battlefield
[4308.26 → 4312.90] 6 with an arc from August 25th to September 14th
[4315.62 → 4320.58] that's actually what's the value of a base version battlefield 6 like what does that make the cost of
[4320.58 → 4326.50] the card if you were going to buy battlefield 6 redemption URL until gamer days offer 70 dollars
[4326.50 → 4335.54] is that like 120 b580 basically that's crazy that's actually nuts is that is there how much is
[4335.54 → 4340.74] battlefield 6 in us duh it's its 70 us dollars apparently
[4343.46 → 4350.90] uh whoa and yet in spite of us pointing out that you can get a heck of a lot of a
[4350.90 → 4358.82] GPU from someone other than team green NVIDIA is I think at all-time high market share uh did that
[4358.82 → 4365.54] did that come out this week yeah uh here we go uh this is from Tom's hardware uh published three days
[4365.54 → 4382.74] ago NVIDIA dominates GPU shipments with 94 share 94 guys I get it okay the cool thing to do is to
[4382.74 → 4389.46] root for AMD and intel to survive in the GPU space so that you can get a cheaper NVIDIA card because they
[4389.46 → 4396.82] have competitors but if nobody buys these other products even when they are legitimately good
[4397.54 → 4405.38] like that b580 for flipping under 200 dollars if you were going to buy battlefield 6 that is a
[4405.38 → 4411.54] insane value right now dude it's close to a hundred dollars who care if you're going to buy battlefield 6.
[4411.54 → 4419.38] go buy a stupid 50 60. Go be a sheep buy a 50 60. Basically if you're not getting the word out
[4419.38 → 4428.02] about there being other options you have no one to blame but yourself when NVIDIA prices their cards
[4428.02 → 4437.62] like the actual monopoly that they are 94 is an actual monopoly
[4440.18 → 4443.86] yeah that is I really wonder like
[4443.86 → 4454.98] there there are laws around effective monopoly right I mean I don't think anyone's going to protect
[4454.98 → 4465.14] gamers right like the thing is that a lot of the lot of anti-monopoly laws are designed to
[4465.94 → 4473.70] protect people from being exploited right so when there's a monopoly on food production
[4473.86 → 4479.94] that's terrible you know when there's when there's monopolistic behaviour in financial
[4479.94 → 4484.98] services that's really really terrible or insurance you know things that people need
[4484.98 → 4493.54] I don't think you're going to get a consumer watchdog coming in and going hey these entirely optional
[4493.54 → 4501.78] video gaming accessories these are too expensive it's not going to happen and as much as that impacts us as
[4501.78 → 4509.62] people who are you knowing technology enthusiasts and gamers um I don't think even the most stalwart of
[4509.62 → 4516.18] gamers is going to make a straight-faced argument that it's somehow as important as food or shelter or
[4516.18 → 4518.50] water transportation right like it's
[4521.78 → 4523.54] I think it just kind of is what it is
[4523.54 → 4529.30] yeah that makes sense it's unfortunate, but it makes sense
[4533.14 → 4541.70] that i i i I'm still a little bit stuck on that intel deal I know right is that worth a video
[4542.58 → 4549.86] I mean like the cheapest bf6 pc, and you include that bundle because it's just like so insane um
[4549.86 → 4558.34] I mean that's not a bad idea yeah because that that is one of probably the craziest GPU bundles i
[4558.34 → 4565.22] think I've ever seen literally ever not no I wouldn't say ever back like uh GTX 460 had some
[4565.22 → 4571.30] bundles where it came with like I think metro exodus or something like that um and that was like a
[4571.30 → 4578.58] very affordable GPU there have been times uh back when AMD and NVIDIA were like really at each other's
[4578.58 → 4584.90] throats competing legitimately actually competing uh where you'd buy a card, and you'd get like three or
[4584.90 → 4590.50] four games with it and stuff I remember that yeah that hasn't really been a thing for a very long time
[4591.46 → 4595.78] I don't remember that not to dog on the games but I don't remember them being like
[4595.78 → 4606.50] massive extremely important multiplayer titles um I mean you know orange box came for
[4606.50 → 4612.66] free with a GPU that I bought so like no there's there are deals there's definitely was that GPU though
[4612.66 → 4617.94] there's been deals um I don't know 250 300 bucks remember back then that was like a pretty high-end
[4617.94 → 4624.82] card though but that's fair still um there's definitely been there's been deals but this is
[4624.82 → 4630.18] probably the best one that I can remember seeing in a while where there's an actually hotly anticipated
[4631.14 → 4638.26] actually triple a looking game um that comes with a 260 GPU that's that's pretty outstanding uh Dan
[4638.26 → 4642.90] do you want to actually send that video idea to me can you just throw that in my inbox real quick
[4642.90 → 4647.06] and then I'll follow it up next week I don't know that we'd be able to execute on this in time
[4647.06 → 4655.14] I wasn't listening um basically uh the cheapest battlefield 6 pc got it yeah, thanks uh it'd be
[4655.14 → 4659.22] great if we could get early access to the game so we could actually validate that it runs perfect
[4659.22 → 4665.06] but I don't uh do we have contacts potentially figure that out I have one yeah if you know someone
[4665.06 → 4670.26] then that would go a long way because i the last thing I would want to do is just go off the
[4670.26 → 4675.62] know the recommended specs on the box because you know it's its not necessarily the best
[4675.62 → 4679.62] and we would have kind of our own standards and our own thoughts on you know what we feel is a
[4679.62 → 4685.78] really playable pc, and we want to make sure that we get the CPU and especially memory a lot of discourse
[4685.78 → 4690.42] on sort of how much memory is enough for gaming these days you know some people are saying 16 gigs
[4690.42 → 4694.74] is still enough I was talking to proof today because we were shooting a video at my house with the
[4694.74 → 4701.14] world's biggest TV uh we got hi sense's new 116-inch oh my god guys don't miss this video this
[4701.14 → 4706.34] thing's incredible anyway uh the point is uh he was saying 32 gigs isn't enough for him anymore
[4706.34 → 4715.38] because he's a person like you Luke who's late for the lobby because he has two games running anyway
[4715.38 → 4719.94] uh so he'll often have multiple games running plus a bunch of Chrome tabs plus his voice comes, and he's
[4719.94 → 4725.54] like yeah I'm like I often run out of ram and I'll get like warning messages uh with 32 gigs so i
[4725.54 → 4731.94] kind of need to go 64 so there's a wide range of what people consider to be enough ram for gaming and
[4731.94 → 4738.42] so we'd want to make sure that we are um you know validating that before we recommend a minimum spec that
[4738.42 → 4742.90] realistically is very minimum, and you're not going to be happy with right
[4742.90 → 4750.74] yeah i I don't know that I can get us early access but I know a perfect person to ask
[4750.74 → 4755.62] basically okay all right well yeah well we'll see what we can do maybe we'll, we'll chase it down next
[4755.62 → 4759.38] week and i I don't even know if we'd be able to execute in time because this deal expires and like
[4760.74 → 4767.38] by Monday it will be oh my god where's my calendar just let the calendar behave like I expect it to
[4768.10 → 4772.50] when was the end date yeah by Monday we will have I think it was the 14th or something we'll have
[4772.50 → 4777.14] like less than a week so I don't know if we're going to get it done in time besides now that we've
[4777.14 → 4780.82] flagged this deal on wan show they might all just sell out anyway and so it might be too late
[4781.78 → 4787.22] I mean I can't imagine that intel has literally zero percent market share they didn't even show up
[4787.78 → 4795.14] on the 90 okay it said NVIDIA had 94 this is from Tom's hardware NVIDIA had 94 AMD had six percent
[4795.14 → 4800.02] and intel literally didn't even show up so i have to imagine that new egg is not stocking
[4800.02 → 4806.98] that many arrow challenger arc b580s what are the 20 in stock 30 I don't know can't be that many
[4811.38 → 4817.70] all right what do you want to talk about next oh you know what actually I'm going to pick something uh
[4817.70 → 4825.22] before we do our sponsors um we have an update to the Roblox child predators story um this is uh Elijah
[4825.22 → 4830.90] posted this in here two weeks ago we talked about how YouTuber schlep known for taking down child
[4830.90 → 4837.62] predators on Roblox had his accounts banned and received a cease and desist letter sent by Roblox
[4838.18 → 4844.90] well things have been heating up Chris Hansen yes that Chris Hansen has thrown his hat into the ring
[4844.90 → 4852.50] announcing a documentary involving schlep and many other journalists and investigative teams
[4852.50 → 4860.34] lawyer and YouTuber law by mike has also thrown his hat in the ring announcing a lawsuit against Roblox
[4860.34 → 4867.06] over their failure to properly protect underage children I do not know law by mike I do know that
[4867.06 → 4872.98] some law YouTubers have been known to kind of or not even law YouTubers but some YouTubers have been
[4872.98 → 4877.78] known to kind of file performative lawsuits but not actually follow through on them so I don't I don't
[4877.78 → 4883.54] know much about him, but it is something that has happened conveniently Roblox also announced they are
[4883.54 → 4889.78] getting an ESB age rating system for games within Roblox and by the end of the year all users who want
[4889.78 → 4894.82] to use communications features have to have their age estimated by the platform in order to confirm they
[4894.82 → 4905.22] are over nine years old uh okay Roblox this is yet another case of um taking action but like what
[4905.22 → 4912.98] is nine ancient enough to be the minimum age to chat with random what are you doing about the
[4912.98 → 4918.34] adults that are talking to the nine-year-olds that's the concern I don't care if a bunch of six-year-olds
[4918.34 → 4927.38] are talking to each other that ain't the issue buddy Roblox throws me off man um there's this situation
[4927.38 → 4935.06] there's the like incredible amount of effectively IP theft that happens on the platform uh that just seems to go
[4935.06 → 4944.82] completely unchecked like I do something about it um i I don't like uh I haven't actually used it enough
[4944.82 → 4952.34] to speak to it properly but from the outside it is seems like not a place that I'm happy about
[4952.34 → 4958.34] got a couple of people in float plane chat saying law by mike is a legit lawyer I am more so than a YouTuber
[4958.34 → 4964.34] so okay that's good to now and then uh there was another one that I wanted to yeah this is
[4964.34 → 4970.50] pretty funny uh drain x in float plane chat says if you're in a fight against Chris Hansen you might
[4970.50 → 4971.54] not be the good guy
[4977.54 → 4985.62] yeah rough yikes all right let's jump into our sponsors here the show is brought to you by thrum
[4985.62 → 4992.90] most of us will never go to space in our lifetime, but that doesn't mean we can't wear a little bit
[4992.90 → 4999.78] of space with us our sponsor thrum makes eye-catching rings out of unique materials like World War ii
[4999.78 → 5008.98] rifle stocks ethically sourced deer antlers and yes genuine meteorite founded in 2012 over 15 years later
[5008.98 → 5016.34] their founder Caleb martin is still making each ring by hand what an absolute chad each purchase of
[5016.34 → 5022.42] a thrum ring comes with a free silicone activity band an American walnut wood ring box free worldwide
[5022.42 → 5027.86] shipping and a limited lifetime warranty they even have sleek minimalist watches with genuine leather
[5027.86 → 5032.50] bands that use some of the same materials as their rings so you can have meteorite on your fingers
[5032.50 → 5040.90] and your wrist wow what a time to be alive moon pies uh sorry head over to thorum.com and use code
[5040.90 → 5050.02] when to get 20 off a unique ring today uh the show is also brought to you by delete me let's play who's
[5050.02 → 5060.34] that leg employee any guesses okay I'm going to say arty that was honestly my guess too I have no idea oh, oh come
[5060.34 → 5068.90] on that's right it's plush oh the hat was such a hack oh legend has it that he owns a display
[5070.74 → 5077.94] man the script dude ah man was I supposed to get this guessing that was easy enough even though I didn't
[5077.94 → 5084.26] get it, but pesky data brokers don't need games to get their hands on your online information like emails
[5084.26 → 5089.30] and phone numbers in fact they're the ones playing the games by selling them to the highest bidder
[5089.30 → 5094.74] the folks at delete me have a list of over 700 data brokers that they can regularly send data
[5094.74 → 5100.18] removal requests to on your behalf you'll then get regular reports with what data was removed and
[5100.18 → 5105.94] from where and with their family plans three of your loved ones, and you can receive delete me's
[5105.94 → 5111.70] protection alongside you each with their own personal data sheet so go to join delete me dot com
[5111.70 → 5118.42] slash when today to get 20 off a plan that suits your needs finally the show is brought to you by
[5118.42 → 5124.50] Squarespace we've been partnered with Squarespace for flipping ages, and you can find them on our
[5124.50 → 5131.94] partners page of our website which was built with Squarespace it is super easy to get started thanks to
[5131.94 → 5137.86] Squarespace blueprints a collection of professionally curated templates then you can customize to your heart's
[5137.86 → 5143.62] content with their fluid engine editor which has a drag and drop code free approach, so anyone can use
[5143.62 → 5149.62] it in fact Colton actually laid the foundation of our new site so it was even easier for the real
[5149.62 → 5155.62] professionals like Sarah to come in and make things look nice and to unify the design language so good
[5155.62 → 5161.70] work Colton wait a second when did we hire this guy back again did they actually go and get this shot
[5161.70 → 5170.58] just for the sponsor spot good gravy anyway uh cool anyway we don't have the need for it but if you

[5174.98 → 5180.58] credit cards Apple Pay and more so don't wait get started on your very own site at squarespace.com
[5180.58 → 5189.94] slash when where you can get 10 off today all right Luke you want to pick one sure let's see what we got here
[5189.94 → 5199.30] um congress congress congress may force NVIDIA to prioritize us AI GPU customers the U.S. senate has
[5199.30 → 5205.54] added an amendment to a major defence bill that may force NVIDIA and AMD to prioritize U.S. customers of
[5205.54 → 5212.50] their advanced GPUs over foreign buyers if the amendment sticks NVIDIA and AMD could not apply for
[5212.50 → 5218.82] a GPU export license so long as United States entities are waiting and unable to acquire those same chips
[5218.82 → 5229.94] okay so basically until meta and Twitter have as many sorry Kai excuse me have as many GPUs as they
[5229.94 → 5236.26] could possibly want also Microsoft nobody else can have literally any in terms of like how these
[5236.26 → 5238.58] companies would have to allocate their production
[5238.58 → 5249.46] it's really apparently it also applies to China specific models like the h20 it's its very um it's
[5249.46 → 5263.54] very it's very interesting um how the free market has become not very free market at all very
[5263.54 → 5270.34] it's its kind of remarkable how fast it happened hey it's like we're just going to take a stake in intel
[5271.06 → 5278.98] um we're going to say yeah you can't ship products offshore even though they were actually most of them
[5278.98 → 5285.70] produced offshore paid yeah you can't ship those products off American shores until America's
[5285.70 → 5293.46] shores are full of all the GPUs um in response NVIDIA tweeted that selling the h20 has no impact
[5293.46 → 5298.98] on our ability to supply other NVIDIA products, and they compared the amendment to the Biden administration's
[5298.98 → 5306.50] now rescinded AI diffusion rule which NVIDIA says was based on doomed science fiction to be clear um
[5308.26 → 5314.42] I think there's NVIDIA officially saying doomed is hilarious I think we have to admit that really
[5314.42 → 5322.58] quick I mean this is the same company that literally called their software GF experience so like
[5323.46 → 5328.66] that's fair nothing surprises me when it comes to NVIDIA they clearly have
[5330.74 → 5337.70] they clearly and look I realize this is the pot calling the kettle black, but they clearly have never
[5337.70 → 5344.74] outgrown their college bro sense of humour like let's be real let's be real for sure neither did we but
[5344.74 → 5353.22] still yeah i I'm owning it I'm owning it yeah you know yeah i i I would admit it 69 times and I would say nice
[5353.86 → 5363.22] every time okay yeah um discussion here we don't actually have a discussion question in the doc but
[5363.22 → 5370.90] i have to say man this is its tough it's another thing that in my opinion seems to just be honestly the real
[5370.90 → 5380.50] effect of this is the dramatic promotion of GPU development and just general compute uh development
[5380.50 → 5387.38] and manufacturing and research that's going to be done within china um all of these things are we
[5387.38 → 5392.98] might be better off for the next extremely short period of time, and we will be significantly deeply
[5392.98 → 5400.26] worse off in the future um if you wanted to have you know better control of this technology being
[5400.26 → 5405.86] basically the only company that anyone goes to for this stuff would probably be the way to do it um and
[5405.86 → 5412.66] that's how things were for quite a long time, and you are repeatedly telling china and all of your Chinese
[5412.66 → 5418.02] customers uh that they are going to have to find a domestic solution, and they're going to need to
[5418.02 → 5425.06] invest very significantly in a domestic solution in order to stay competitive um and if you don't think
[5425.06 → 5431.86] they're going to do so you're just stupid um so tell us how you really feel Luke hey in other um
[5431.86 → 5440.10] breaking news uh this was just posted in chat by David Lane google was just hit with a 3.45 billion
[5440.10 → 5447.54] EU antitrust fine over their ad tech practices and this is in the same week that an U.S. judge said um
[5448.10 → 5453.46] yeah you guys are a monopoly, but also you know what forget it you're not really have to gonna
[5453.46 → 5459.14] do anything about it, you can keep chrome, and you can keep android, and we're not going to do anything to
[5459.14 → 5469.06] break you up because like AI seems pretty important and stuff um so google's getting some super mixed
[5469.06 → 5476.98] messages here but wow oh in other news hold on um trump calls the EU fine unfair and threatens
[5476.98 → 5483.86] retaliation I feel like you could just kind of put that under any article um anyway google plans to
[5483.86 → 5490.10] appeal you could probably put that under any article about google and the EU warns of stronger remedies
[5490.10 → 5500.02] if google fails to comply oh yeah good luck everybody so on the one hand uh google next war is an economic one
[5500.02 → 5510.02] yeah um the next war is realizing that you're already in the information war and the economic war
[5510.66 → 5517.22] um not to mention the various other more traditional but now proxy wars and all the various other types of
[5517.78 → 5525.86] of wars that are ongoing it is moon pies what a time to be alive man
[5525.86 → 5539.78] yeah um oh man how'd we miss this apparently aura aura aura is uh is suing other smart ring manufacturers
[5540.82 → 5545.38] yeah that doesn't really I thought they also got like a defence contract or something crazy
[5546.18 → 5549.38] yeah did they um let me see
[5549.38 → 5553.46] let me see
[5554.58 → 5559.78] sorry guys this is very much just like people in float plane dumping topics into the chat and us
[5559.78 → 5566.42] looking at them there we have done absolutely no prep on these whatsoever apparently oh hey you
[5566.42 → 5572.34] know what we have done some prep on you want to talk about uh valve's new VR hardware right on the eve of
[5572.34 → 5577.86] the arrival of your new VR headset that you spent over a thousand us dollars on is that something that you'd like
[5577.86 → 5584.10] to talk about Luke not really why don't we talk about it anyway so I mean I'm still very excited
[5584.10 → 5591.38] about my big screen beyond but has it arrived yet uh yes, but it arrived the day that I left so i never
[5591.38 → 5599.30] even got to see it nice I've actually been using mine a bit lately when it showed up, and it's its as great
[5599.30 → 5605.86] as I represented to you in fact it's better because I got my fixed one back, and it is very much actually
[5605.86 → 5613.22] fixed so I'm not having tracking issues with the wands and um I'm super stoked it looks so good
[5614.74 → 5622.10] and valve has a new one valve has applied for a trademark on the term steam frame and between the
[5622.10 → 5629.22] content of the filings and some heavy-duty data mining by brad lynch aka sadly it's Bradley on Twitter
[5629.22 → 5635.78] it looks like new VR hardware might soon be officially announced by valve data mining of the
[5635.78 → 5642.34] latest steam VR beta has revealed that valve is appearing to be working on a rebranding of steam
[5642.34 → 5650.90] VR overlays to frames and brad lynch also speculates that the official name of the rumoured declared headset
[5650.90 → 5658.26] will be the steam frame with the major selling point being its spatial gaming capabilities lynch also noted
[5658.26 → 5665.14] that the Roy VR controllers are no longer marked as prototypes in the steam VR drivers and that
[5665.14 → 5675.06] drivers are now finished for a steam link VR USB dongle using Wi-Fi 6e slash 6 gigahertz so
[5675.94 → 5681.70] what this probably looks like based on that every rumour I've seen about declared indicates that it's
[5681.70 → 5688.02] going to be inside out tracking with onboard processing um what this seems to add up to is an
[5688.02 → 5695.14] inside out with built-in compute VR headset more akin to what we've seen from the meta quest lineup or
[5695.14 → 5703.22] apple vision pro lineup but if the 6 gigahertz dongle is anything to go by with the capability of
[5703.22 → 5711.62] wirelessly linking to your pc for high fidelity pc gaming what remains to be seen is what the resolution
[5711.62 → 5718.58] valve is going to be able to push is going to be because I'm not aware of a wireless interface
[5718.58 → 5729.70] that can reliably and consistently match a wired interface for displays yet and if anything even
[5729.70 → 5736.34] the fastest display links these days are not enough for what I was hoping would be the future of high
[5736.34 → 5746.26] fidelity pc VR um I have kind of out of the know side of my eyes been sort of watching the rumours
[5746.26 → 5754.02] around declared and kind of just hoping and hoping and hoping that maybe it's not um the whole story
[5754.02 → 5760.50] because I really wanted a second gen or I guess third gen i I wanted another generation of lighthouse
[5760.50 → 5768.82] um yeah for the third party ecosystem of VR headsets that has sprung up around steam VR and
[5768.82 → 5778.02] steam VR 2.0, but it looks like maybe that's just going to be dead um I don't know we'll have to see
[5778.66 → 5784.90] it the rumours seem pretty strong, but it is technically still rumour mill yeah it does seem like the evidence
[5784.90 → 5792.26] is really stacking up that declared is going to be a standalone headset and that this whole ecosystem
[5792.26 → 5798.02] of outside-in tracking is just going to be kind of stuck where it is today with what is if it's 90
[5798.02 → 5806.18] refreshes per second for the lighthouses I think uh i that sounds right I don't know um
[5807.78 → 5813.70] I think they're I think they're 90 hertz uh VR base station blah blah blah well the base stations
[5813.70 → 5819.14] themselves are not uh how often do they refresh you guys some someone's gotta someone's
[5819.14 → 5825.86] gotta know uh lighthouse tracking 2.0 with alternating brain warp uh 75 90 hertz 150
[5825.86 → 5832.26] 180 with alternating eye brain warp rendering now to be clear that's not the only data input there's also
[5832.26 → 5839.22] a built-in um accelerometer slash gyro in the controllers themselves and so the lighthouses are
[5839.22 → 5844.98] from my understanding um in order to keep making sure that they don't drift off course but
[5847.54 → 5854.66] still i I really hoped that large scale outside in would continue to be a thing i I do understand
[5854.66 → 5860.58] why it's not a thing because who has the space for it who's going to go and wire 12 volt power into their
[5860.58 → 5865.78] ceiling so that they can have a stealthy installation of a bunch of you know base stations who's gonna
[5865.78 → 5869.78] you know get four of them so that they never have any occlusion even when they have an extremely large
[5869.78 → 5876.82] play area basically me and only me and so fine I get it um but hopefully valve has taken
[5876.82 → 5881.54] that I mean they've clearly taken their time, and hopefully they've cooked up something absolutely
[5881.54 → 5888.50] fire and I'm gonna absolutely love the frame or declared or whatever they ultimately end up calling it
[5888.50 → 5894.18] either way Luke i I don't think you're going to be disappointed with your big screen beyond because
[5894.18 → 5900.98] no I'm excited if there is any onboard compute in declared then there's absolutely no way that it's
[5900.98 → 5908.82] going to be light period I mean apple for all their billions of dollars of r d uh no it's to be clear not
[5908.82 → 5914.50] all of which went into the vision pro, but you know some of it did um couldn't figure out how to make a
[5914.50 → 5922.42] an on-device compute uh VR headset you know not freaking heavy so I don't think valve is gonna
[5922.42 → 5929.62] crack that nut just right now gay coins yeah I'm also just like I don't know you can't always
[5929.62 → 5934.50] time everything perfectly and even if I could I feel like I still would have gone with the big screen
[5934.50 → 5940.42] beyond uh yeah it's very readable that I'm I'm happy to support and honestly I'm just really excited to
[5940.42 → 5945.86] get it so I don't know get coins uh says what's the current state of using VR for productivity i have to
[5945.86 → 5953.94] say I never got into it, i I tried it when I did my apple vision pro review and there were things about
[5953.94 → 5961.78] it that were compelling but wearing something on my face for such an extended period of time for the
[5961.78 → 5967.62] work day especially working in office where I frequently interact with other fellow humans
[5967.62 → 5974.42] it's just not feasible it's not viable for me, I still know people not even just person I still
[5974.42 → 5982.98] know people that use it for what was kind of probably the most logical use case I think for
[5982.98 → 5990.66] the apple vision pro which was like uh work while travelling um, and they still seem to find a lot of
[5990.66 → 5997.62] success from it which is cool um, and yet I have I'm basically back to travelling now I've been travelling
[5997.62 → 6005.22] a fair bit and I've seen exactly zero vision pros on the road so that's clearly a niche use case I mean
[6005.22 → 6011.54] compared to when it first came out I mean I would love to see the numbers for this what percentage
[6011.54 → 6017.70] because apple has a no questions asked is it 14 day or 30 day can't remember, but apple has a no questions
[6017.70 → 6025.22] asked return policy which for electronics these days by the way yeah like what percentage of vision
[6025.22 → 6033.78] pros that were purchased have been returned because they were flipping everywhere for two weeks and then
[6037.78 → 6044.26] radio silence gone wiped off the face of the earth you know how like practically every single pole
[6044.26 → 6051.46] is like corrupted in some way yeah it would be cool to have an actual real poll of like hey did you buy one
[6051.46 → 6062.10] and if you bought it do you still use it in any capacity at all yeah apple vision dust collector yeah big time
[6064.90 → 6073.70] all right do we have any other uh headline topics oh, oh crap I screwed it up again Sammy's going to kill me
[6074.26 → 6077.62] I haven't done the float plane announcement I was supposed to do it before sponsors
[6078.26 → 6083.78] freaking okay look Sammy if you want it right before the sponsors than why don't you put it
[6085.46 → 6090.82] right before the sponsors it's separated by like six topics that that's on me, they keep uh
[6090.82 → 6095.30] overwriting it and have to add it back in manually I'll put it down there in future after intense
[6095.30 → 6102.58] competition and almost getting scammed multiple times um the finale of scrapyard wars 10 is ready to be
[6102.58 → 6109.38] released for early access on float plane alongside the extras today uh i I have a thing here that
[6109.38 → 6115.70] says link Hoffman to provide to Dan during show uh do do do we have it yet is it doesn't don't do the
[6115.70 → 6118.66] float plane announcement just yet oh
[6120.90 → 6128.26] uh okay we will let you know later when it goes live later today all right why don't we give a little
[6128.26 → 6132.82] more information on the thing that I was talking about earlier where google dodged the harsh antitrust
[6132.82 → 6139.14] ruling the same judge who last august ruled that google broke U.S. competition laws has effectively
[6139.14 → 6146.34] decided not to do very much about it judge Amit mites called that meta called google an overbearing
[6146.34 → 6153.06] illegal monopoly back then but now says that the emergence of generative AI has changed the landscape
[6153.06 → 6159.46] the ruling states that google must share access to user-side data, so things like search index and
[6159.46 → 6165.30] user interaction data with qualified competitors but does not have to share advertising data
[6165.30 → 6170.90] google doesn't have to divest of chrome or android google can continue to pay apple and Mozilla to place
[6170.90 → 6177.46] google search in safari and Firefox respectively oh really yeah earlier this year Mozilla's CEO warned
[6177.46 → 6180.90] that cutting google's search subsidy could ultimately put Firefox out of business
[6180.90 → 6186.90] uh this ruling also requires google to stop entering into exclusive deals that make google the default
[6186.90 → 6192.74] search on mobile devices and to submit to six years of regulatory oversight uh the DOJ is expected to
[6192.74 → 6200.82] appeal this ruling so uh basically what we've learned is that once again in America you can do basically
[6200.82 → 6208.42] whatever it takes to get on top and um the only thing that you will ever have to do as penance for that
[6208.42 → 6220.02] is um say you're sorry maybe have a little bit of oversight and maybe pay a token fine good job you can
[6220.02 → 6226.82] always become too big to fail that is always an option yep do whatever it takes to become so
[6226.82 → 6232.98] big that it would cause the failure of other things if you were punished for your ill-gotten gains yeah
[6232.98 → 6238.34] nipples cage says that's it I'm calling shenanigans shenanigans shenanigans
[6240.58 → 6244.26] hey um you wanted to talk about how silk song crashed all the stores
[6245.70 → 6250.34] even yeah, so this did it actually crash steam I think it was just slow
[6251.54 → 6257.86] okay uh I'm even surprised at that to be honest people couldn't check out juggernaut yeah wow like
[6257.86 → 6263.70] the payment system failed dude it's the highly anticipated sequel to hollow knight silk song is
[6263.70 → 6269.54] already setting records in spite of causing major hiccups for virtually all of its launch platforms
[6269.54 → 6274.66] silk song has already recorded more than a hundred thousand concurrent players on steam in spite of heavy
[6274.66 → 6282.02] traffic crashing the game's steam page for several hours wow that's nutting the first hollow knight's peak
[6282.02 → 6288.90] concurrent player count was the first hollow knight's but yeah first uh is 72 916.
[6288.90 → 6294.82] IGN reported also running into trouble when trying to buy the game on the Nintendo e store PlayStation
[6294.82 → 6302.50] store and Xbox silk song is also a day one game pass title, but game pass subscribers reported trouble
[6302.50 → 6311.86] downloading the title on the Xbox app and consoles wow um that's actually kind of nuts um yeah no i
[6311.86 → 6317.06] i I saw this in the doc and I while it's interesting that it took all those stores down i also just
[6318.10 → 6322.26] think it's cool that there's a game that people are really excited about coming out because that
[6322.26 → 6329.70] doesn't happen that often lately and with battlefield 6 sounding very positive so far in
[6329.70 → 6335.38] its pre-release work um and silk song coming out I wonder what is like the steam ratings for
[6335.38 → 6341.22] silk song right now overwhelmingly positive that's pretty good yeah I'm not too surprised
[6341.86 → 6349.54] but they definitely took their time I'm I'm shocked that given it was the most wish listed game on the
[6349.54 → 6356.98] platform if I recall correctly on steam that they only they went with 20 bucks for their price
[6357.46 → 6362.34] because you can always discount it to 20 bucks later, but it seems like they've just gone the hey
[6362.34 → 6368.90] yeah it's 20 bucks um you know we might discount it at some point, but we're just going to go the like
[6368.90 → 6376.90] rate gamers are going to pay and uh here you go gotta you have to respect it you have to respect it I can't say
[6376.90 → 6383.30] that I would have had the discipline to do the same thing Luke if you had the most wish listed game on
[6383.30 → 6394.26] steam would you go 20 bucks um honestly I think it depends a lot on the team that I have
[6395.14 → 6400.50] and if I'm the team making silk song I think so yeah as far as my understanding goes they're pretty
[6400.50 → 6407.38] small they're already like incredibly balling from the original hollow knight um I think you know that
[6407.38 → 6413.54] this price tag is probably not going to piss people off too much I don't even think 24.99 or 29.99
[6413.54 → 6422.50] would have made people too upset no 20 bucks is dude 20 bucks like that's like two coffees these days
[6424.58 → 6431.94] seriously what's kind of interesting to me is that um it's you said it's overwhelmingly positive on your end
[6431.94 → 6439.38] yeah it's just very positive on mine really I mean I looked earlier so I haven't looked in a couple of
[6439.38 → 6450.02] hours interesting oh yeah I see very positive now too interesting I'm wondering if this has crashed into
[6451.06 → 6459.54] uh like it was so hyped that even if it's absolutely fantastic I wonder if people's expectations
[6459.54 → 6466.58] were just unfathomably high um it's rare that I've seen this much hype for a game like ever to be
[6466.58 → 6472.82] honest um I mean if it's crashing every single store that it's on you can imagine the amount of
[6472.82 → 6477.86] different people that are jumping in yeah and if it has a higher concurrent player count than the
[6477.86 → 6483.30] original ever had already, and it's so hyped you might be getting people who just frankly aren't that
[6483.30 → 6489.30] into metroidvanias playing this game and going I don't get it which yep I have to admit
[6489.30 → 6498.50] I tried twice to get into hollow knight twice I tried twice I failed i I think I have like three
[6498.50 → 6505.78] or four hours in it and i just kind of got bored and uh didn't keep playing and yeah metroidvanias aren't
[6505.78 → 6512.66] my kind of game i never really got into hollow knight either um and I haven't been like overhyped about
[6512.66 → 6519.94] silk song um I might check it out it seems uh like it's pretty well positioned price wise so it's
[6519.94 → 6525.86] pretty likely that I'll check it out at some point but like yeah I don't know it's crazy that it's been
[6525.86 → 6536.34] out for as little time as it has been, and it has 24 000 reviews already like my god um so honestly i I think
[6536.34 → 6543.78] this is very likely realistically more on the overwhelmingly positive side of things, but it's
[6543.78 → 6547.94] just being reviewed like you said by a ton of people that probably aren't actually super into the game
[6547.94 → 6554.98] just heard the hype bought in and then maybe don't like the genre necessarily more than the game
[6554.98 → 6560.50] itself there 's's that quote from the hell divers developers that I've just always really liked
[6560.50 → 6566.66] um which is a game made for everyone is a game made for no one yeah and when you hit this level
[6566.66 → 6572.18] of popularity some of the negative reviews might be just because it was a game that wasn't made for you
[6572.18 → 6579.54] okay this is cool check this out what's up you can actually see um
[6580.98 → 6589.06] the rating in every language because of that new filtering feature so English is now very positive
[6589.06 → 6594.50] I believe was overwhelmingly positive earlier today we talked about that on the man rand show yep um
[6595.22 → 6606.18] Chinese not that into it 11 000 reviews so that is the second-biggest language market for this game
[6606.18 → 6611.30] and they're like oh my god, so the 24 000 reviews is only in English there's so many more than that
[6611.30 → 6622.98] yeah 60 000 wow that's crazy um the Latin world flipping loves it is part of that uh a lot of
[6622.98 → 6631.30] these a lot of these uh I know that Brazil in particular is heavily ta riffed and computers tend to not be as
[6631.30 → 6639.46] high performance for the average gamer is part of that just having a brand-new game that is super, super
[6639.46 → 6645.14] hype that runs great on your machine like do you think there's just a little bit of excitement about
[6645.14 → 6650.10] that potentially it might be part of it might be part of it I'm just I'm just like I'm just guessing
[6650.10 → 6657.94] you know why do the Turks love it um the poles they love it they the poles they love sales song
[6657.94 → 6663.94] they just love it the Koreans yeah they're kind of positive along with the French and the Germans
[6663.94 → 6668.34] the Italians are very positive Ukrainians yep yeah we're we're pretty positive on this too
[6670.10 → 6675.14] apparently the very interesting I lost the comment but apparently the Chinese language translation was
[6675.14 → 6683.22] like super botched on launch I don't know if that you know means they won't ever fix it but
[6683.22 → 6695.54] uh yeah I can't find the comment, but apparently that was the thing apparently it's very cheap in Mexico
[6697.22 → 6701.62] so they probably did uh some very focused localized pricing
[6703.78 → 6709.94] I wanted to go I wanted to go check out what the breakdown was for tape to tape, but it turns out that
[6709.94 → 6716.26] they do not have enough reviews to trigger a language specific review score there are all languages
[6716.98 → 6726.10] and your languages and uh yeah wait they're different though I know I'm not quite sure what that means
[6726.90 → 6730.18] that's kind of weird yeah interesting
[6732.42 → 6732.90] anywho
[6732.90 → 6748.42] moving on it took 15 years but Instagram is finally available for iPad and this was the best they
[6748.42 → 6748.90] could do
[6751.78 → 6756.10] holy actual that's all I have to say
[6756.10 → 6762.26] I can't any I can say more
[6764.18 → 6768.10] look at all look at all this bled you're a photo app
[6769.94 → 6778.66] supposedly what is all of this bled space what the heck what are you even doing
[6778.66 → 6786.18] just don't even bother then why'd they do it in landscape as well, well because it's an iPad you
[6786.18 → 6788.82] got to be able to landscape but like oh my god
[6791.78 → 6795.54] this is the best you could do this is very odd
[6798.10 → 6803.06] I don't really understand parallelogram says what's wrong with blank space it made Taylor Swift millions
[6803.06 → 6812.26] thank you float plane chat I love that you guys are there for me to make me feel better about my jokes
[6813.22 → 6823.14] is that a song no oh blank space yes okay um okay this is something robot vacuums level up
[6823.14 → 6830.66] literally Sufi has created a robot vacuum that goes up the stairs sort of that's definitely the brand i
[6830.66 → 6837.14] I would want that from here we go that's a joke yeah I know right
[6840.34 → 6842.82] so Sufi shows off the new Mars walker
[6844.90 → 6851.46] is a shell that allows compatible robot vacuums to dock themselves and get carried up flights of stairs
[6851.46 → 6857.62] what the only vacuum right now that will be compatible is the omni s2 scheduled to launch in January
[6857.62 → 6864.98] 2026 for 1600 us dollars the Mars walker attachment has no price yet but is an add-on
[6865.54 → 6868.82] it also doesn't clean the stairs it just goes up them yeah
[6870.98 → 6872.98] I mean i sure
[6875.86 → 6878.98] that's another one that i really just don't think I have that much to say about
[6878.98 → 6888.34] wait hold on the look on your face kind of says it all doesn't it no I'm just a little bit confused
[6888.34 → 6892.58] by the writing because like it says the only vacuum compatible is the omni s2 scheduled launch
[6892.58 → 6897.38] in January 2026 for 1600 us dollars, and then it says for this price point is it even worth buying a
[6897.38 → 6902.90] robot vacuum at this point or is it better to hire weekly cleaners okay are there cheaper vacuums
[6902.90 → 6907.06] stuff like there is there oh yeah there's way cheaper vacuums, but this is that's the only one
[6907.06 → 6912.18] that's going to be compatible with the Mars walker yeah but you could just buy two of them you
[6912.18 → 6916.10] can just buy one for your upper floor you might literally be better off just oh a hundred percent
[6916.10 → 6922.58] robotic thing is like between three and a thousand three hundred and a thousand dollars
[6922.58 → 6926.98] so you would literally just be better off yeah pancratic is in the chat he's like my first car was
[6926.98 → 6932.82] significantly cheaper than that robot vacuum yeah yeah and the Mars walker is an accessory
[6932.82 → 6937.62] so presumably that accessory is not free on top of the sixteen hundred dollars
[6939.38 → 6945.86] I mean i have to imagine that with how okay I'll say this with how much money robot vacuum manufacturers
[6945.86 → 6952.10] seem to have to throw around for sponsorships clearly people are buying them like they're also just all
[6952.10 → 6958.18] over every trade show ever like there 's's yeah there's something to be said about what the heck
[6958.18 → 6962.82] is going on their dude I can't believe I can't believe how many pool robot companies there are
[6964.26 → 6969.70] right yeah we saw another one at IFA that was actually that was nuts I made a joke about how we
[6969.70 → 6976.18] should do like a top five pool robots short um as a joke there wasn't enough of them but there
[6976.18 → 6984.58] there are definitely some there's and again same thing they seem to have ample budgets for sponsorships so
[6984.58 → 6987.38] presumably people are buying these things
[6990.26 → 6994.58] it's not that they don't work like I'm not I'm not saying they're like dumb or whatever they're just
[6994.58 → 7000.34] they're really expensive and there and there are places in the world that are it's its like more
[7000.34 → 7009.46] common to have a pool but yeah the robot itself is very expensive it's interesting um clearly high
[7009.46 → 7016.90] margin I'd say that much Dolby has jumped on the AI bandwagon Dolby has announced some of the new
[7016.90 → 7024.02] features coming in Dolby Vision 2 the successor to its popular Dolby Vision HDR format the original
[7024.02 → 7030.42] Dolby Vision was meant to give creators the ability to fine-tune how TVs present content in HDR and it
[7030.42 → 7036.66] really was noticeably better than HDR 10 which was its primary competitor at the time
[7037.30 → 7046.18] Dolby Vision allows you to include metadata that tells your device scene by scene how to fine-tune
[7046.18 → 7054.34] the image that it is outputting um HDR 10 did not you were stuck sort of within a fixed band the new
[7054.34 → 7060.26] format seems to be trying to strike a balance between artistic intent and solving common viewer complaints
[7060.26 → 7066.50] so content intelligence apparently adds new AI capabilities to make the image crystal clear by
[7066.98 → 7072.66] improving clarity in any viewing environment without compromising intent fixing things like content
[7072.66 → 7083.14] appearing too dark in less optimal environments oh okay and then authentic motion is supposed to be
[7083.14 → 7089.70] the world's first creative driven motion control tool to make scenes feel more authentically cinematic
[7089.70 → 7100.02] but without unwanted judder on a shot by shot basis okay in this case Dolby claims to have fixed the soap opera
[7100.02 → 7108.42] effect that is commonly caused by motion smoothing by allowing filmmakers scene by scene control over how the feature
[7108.42 → 7120.66] is leveraged interesting there are definitely cases where judder or even 20 just 24 fps just low frame rate has been
[7121.22 → 7126.98] very distracting to me in films that otherwise are just beautiful and amazing and perfect in every way
[7126.98 → 7132.82] like uh it's like some of the mountain shots in Lord of the Rings for instance yes where it's just like
[7132.82 → 7139.94] here are some mountain peaks, and they're like across the screen it's like yo that's just distracting um
[7139.94 → 7145.62] I think that honestly the Lord of the Rings mountain scenes is like the most classic example of that problem
[7145.62 → 7152.50] I don't mind the authentic motion part if it's giving the filmmaker the tool because i I trust the
[7152.50 → 7160.34] filmmaker with this tool I don't trust TV manufacturers and I don't trust AI and that's where content intelligence
[7160.34 → 7169.06] is sort of bugging me like I get that is it actually AI though like okay is it uh like what
[7169.78 → 7174.10] one of the problems we have with AI is like what kind yeah what are we talking about yeah what are we
[7174.10 → 7180.42] talking about here certain types of machine learning it might be completely fine um, and they might just be
[7180.42 → 7185.86] putting it in the if this is just an auto calibration tool right where it's just using an onboard
[7185.86 → 7194.10] uh where a light sensor and is just kind of like fine-tuning the gamma curve or whatever then I mean
[7194.10 → 7199.86] sure but then like are you just calling it AI because everything has to be AI now or are you actually
[7199.86 → 7206.66] like actually are you generative anything because I don't want that I'm at if aright now uh which is
[7206.66 → 7215.38] like uh I don't know it's its not quite, but some people brand it as like Europe's CES um and man the
[7215.38 → 7225.30] AI branding is everywhere and genuinely often has nothing to do with anything um i i I think we've
[7225.30 → 7231.38] seen at least a couple of times when the AI branding is for features that like are definitely not AI but
[7231.38 → 7236.26] aced like i would actually bet money that they're not um and in other cases it's like okay this
[7236.26 → 7242.82] is a very old like you know machine learning type of approach yeah um that they've rebranded as
[7242.82 → 7249.14] you know smart AI or whatever um there 's's also examples where
[7251.38 → 7257.14] I mean this is classic, but you don't even want it uh oh well yeah sure like it's just worse like
[7257.14 → 7263.46] the even if it seems to have a lot of uh appliances which is not super normal for me at trade shows at
[7263.46 → 7270.02] least um like there's an entire hall of like washing machines and oh are they AI though stuff
[7270.02 → 7276.74] they're they're like all AI based and in a lot of ways it's like just stupid and I don't want it
[7276.74 → 7283.62] um and I was ranting about how like I want the dumbest fridge you can give me like I don't I don't
[7283.62 → 7288.02] want my fridge to like to tell me what groceries are missing because you just know that's for
[7288.02 → 7294.26] sure data harvesting and even if it wasn't even if it wasn't data harvesting how could it possibly know
[7294.26 → 7300.42] how much sour cream is in the tub it doesn't know I mean that's a good argument right there it can't
[7300.42 → 7306.90] know anything useful maybe it like watches how many times you take it out and like a
[7306.90 → 7314.90] tool has weight sensors in the shelves I don't know dude a tool that gives me 30 of the information that
[7314.90 → 7322.90] I need is not a useful tool like I wouldn't mind having a live camera feed in my fridge that I can
[7322.90 → 7328.26] like log into like a security camera I could see that being useful if I just want to know like oh
[7328.26 → 7333.94] crap did i get a second jug of milk last time I was shopping because if I didn't then I should get
[7333.94 → 7337.86] like because we generally keep two jugs of milk in our house we have one that's in like the front
[7338.50 → 7342.90] so that the kids can like to get it, and then we'll usually have the backup one because that one will run
[7342.90 → 7347.22] out at some point um and so it's like do we have a backup jug of milk right now like that yeah sure
[7347.22 → 7354.26] yeah fine useful but like trying to like to generate a shopping list for me dude we are
[7355.22 → 7361.70] decades away from that being useful at all being functional enough that it could actually do anything
[7362.42 → 7366.74] I wonder what your input on this is so we found a fridge I don't know I genuinely don't remember who
[7366.74 → 7371.38] made it i I think it might have been Samsung but oh hold on hold that thought hold that thought
[7371.38 → 7378.58] people are upset people are upset fanboy NZ says not bags of milk tidbit says jugs question mark
[7378.58 → 7383.70] question mark question brother I've been getting my milk from jugs since I was firstborn
[7387.70 → 7394.02] took him a sec some of that was latency some of that was I think I got that pretty quick that was uh
[7394.02 → 7400.98] it's its jugs on the west coast milk in a bag is this weird like eastern Canada thing i I did I I went
[7400.98 → 7407.62] over there once and I stayed with a family for an exchange and I was like this just seems like a jug
[7407.62 → 7412.50] of milk with extra steps like are we seriously all on board with this uh anyway sorry, sorry carry on
[7413.46 → 7418.18] so i I think it was Samsung but I didn't I generally don't remember who and if it's not Samsung my bad
[7418.18 → 7425.54] um but somebody here has a fridge that you can speak to um and the only command that I noticed that
[7425.54 → 7430.26] it had been and I was trying to i was trying to jailbreak some of the AI systems while we were here
[7430.58 → 7437.06] um there 's's like an ac that you can talk to and ask it to like lower and and and up the
[7437.06 → 7441.62] temperature in the room and I was trying to get it to output like muffin recipes and stuff but I have
[7441.62 → 7448.18] so far failed I have not given up um but there's yeah there's a fridge that you can ask it to open
[7448.18 → 7455.54] okay verbally, and it will open the doors for you okay is that actually faster than opening it I mean
[7455.54 → 7458.82] if you're going to get anything it's actually like kind of slow if you're going to get anything out of
[7458.82 → 7465.22] it you have to be standing there anyway yeah the thing that I thought was interesting is like I could
[7465.22 → 7473.22] maybe imagine a situation where I want to voice command the door to close yeah but i I can't really
[7473.22 → 7478.74] imagine a situation where I want to voice command the door to open yeah um so I tried to while it
[7478.74 → 7483.06] only advertised saying open but I tried to while I was standing there voice command it to close
[7483.86 → 7491.78] um, and it just didn't okay so there was a booth attendant there and I was like hey so like is there
[7491.78 → 7500.34] a plan to support closing in the future yeah, and he's like oh no for sure no I was like why he's like oh
[7500.34 → 7507.06] child safety, but it's a fridge and my couldn't they just push it open like it doesn't lock okay so
[7507.70 → 7515.38] so bashing the kid with the door as it swings open is not a child safety issue but hitting them with the
[7515.38 → 7519.94] door as it closes is a child safety issue and he is just straight up was like yeah
[7522.26 → 7528.02] I don't know dude this is like kind of how I imagine the conversations went at like Porsche
[7528.02 → 7535.78] headquarters like i I only figured out fairly recently that it's their choice that I can't
[7535.78 → 7542.66] type on my keyboard while my car is not in park um, or it's not in park only while it's completely
[7542.66 → 7549.38] not in motion so like my passenger is not allowed to key in a destination for me yeah unless I am
[7549.38 → 7554.42] stopped and voice control is utterly useless for navigation it just doesn't work unless you happen to
[7554.42 → 7559.78] live in magical fairyland where all of your streets happen to have names that are easily understood by
[7559.78 → 7569.22] a machine um, and it's like it's their decision and the amount of extra distraction that is caused
[7569.22 → 7575.22] by issuing a voice command multiple times or like having to verify that it is actually sending you to
[7575.22 → 7582.02] the wrong place instead of absolute no man's land Narnia somewhere is so much more than if I could press
[7582.02 → 7588.34] three characters and click the first auto complete like you can in a tesla like you can in other
[7588.34 → 7596.98] Volkswagen group vehicles like I just like the kind of absolute broken moon logic that you encounter
[7596.98 → 7603.46] with product designers sometimes is just so frustrating to me, and it's one of those things where it's like
[7603.46 → 7610.02] I totally get it some people might actually disagree with me on this point and that's totally fine but that is not
[7610.02 → 7616.18] that is not the manufacturer's job the manufacturer's job is to get the out of my way and let me use the
[7616.18 → 7622.26] product that I paid a considerable sum of money for that's the manufacturer's job payment processors the
[7622.26 → 7629.70] the other thing I would say too is like it's its kind of funky to me because they have supported features
[7629.70 → 7637.70] in the car based on weight in the passenger seat for a super long time because there's the whole airbag thing
[7637.70 → 7645.06] right so they could just allow you to type on the screen if there's a passenger in the seat yep that
[7645.06 → 7650.74] would like actually be very easy for them to do or better, yet they could just piss off and while I'm
[7650.74 → 7657.30] while I'm like you know pulling out of my driveway I could go do do instead of having to go
[7657.30 → 7662.90] oh kind of lots of yeah slam the brakes and type and then go and oh
[7662.90 → 7668.98] or I'm assuming you might be able to circumvent it by just being on your phone while you're driving
[7668.98 → 7676.42] which is yes you can ideal you 100 can don't ask me how I know you that I guarantee you that people
[7676.42 → 7683.14] do that uh and now even more so guarantee that people do that um yeah that's not better just
[7683.14 → 7689.46] worse so much worse just get out of my way and let me type a few characters also I'm not trying to
[7689.46 → 7696.34] like dog on Porsche right now they're having all kinds of trouble um, but they were like so proud
[7696.34 → 7703.78] um so Ivan got a Macau EV earlier, and they were like so proud at both of the dealerships we went to
[7703.78 → 7710.18] to to to look at various uh used ones because we were trying to get a deal um of like how much more
[7710.18 → 7715.78] responsive the interface is I'm like bro yes it's better than what's in my take hand but like
[7715.78 → 7721.94] like it's still worse than a tesla from like five years ago what are you guys even doing
[7722.50 → 7727.46] like come on man they're like oh it's so responsive now you're going to love it I'm like dude
[7728.34 → 7734.34] I have a smartphone don't you have a smartphone so you know what a touch screen supposed to feel like
[7734.34 → 7744.34] right this ain't it oh yeah what trouble financial trouble um basically the entire world is
[7745.30 → 7752.42] moving on to Chinese EVS and accept the places where they are ta riffed out of competitiveness
[7752.98 → 7761.54] and even that is just a matter of time like I would be I would be surprised if one of Canada's
[7761.54 → 7771.62] responses to the U.S. tariff trade war situation wouldn't be to say oh so you want to completely
[7771.62 → 7778.34] up the integrated North American automotive supply chain okay you too we're gonna just remove our
[7778.34 → 7786.34] tariffs on Chinese EVS um see you later that would be super destructive to us too, but it's a super
[7786.34 → 7791.14] destruction that's already happening so all right yeah we're already getting wrecked in that way so
[7791.14 → 7795.22] yeah I don't know how much it would necessarily change to be honest this is one of the is one
[7795.22 → 7800.66] of those things where it's like forethought doesn't seem to be a super strong suit of this is just like
[7800.66 → 7808.10] the NVIDIA GPU thing it's its yeah it's very short-sighted yep yeah redness says I support that
[7808.10 → 7814.26] idea I think we've got two of our premieres already that have gone on record publicly saying we should
[7814.26 → 7820.98] just drop the tariffs then on Chinese EVS because I think we have the same tariffs as the US 100 tariffs on
[7820.98 → 7834.26] Chinese EVS um yeah, yeah good luck everybody what else we got for this week the Lenovo legion go 2
[7834.58 → 7840.34] electric boogaloo Lenovo has revealed its next handheld gaming device the legion go to the same
[7840.34 → 7848.98] 8.8 inch size, but it is now OLED with lower resolution 1920 by 1200 instead of 2560 by 1600 and 100
[7848.98 → 7854.74] oh that's fine honestly at that size 1920 by 1200 is lots it also apparently has a 144 hertz refresh
[7854.74 → 7862.50] rate with support for variable refresh rate that's sick a VR OLED is that a first in a handheld does
[7862.50 → 7870.90] anyone have VR OLED yet I don't know uh guys hit me up if there's a VR OLED because there's
[7870.90 → 7876.82] switch OLED, but it doesn't support VR there's steam deck OLED my understanding is it does not support VR
[7876.82 → 7883.78] uh my understanding is that that was part of the reason that Asus has given for not doing
[7883.78 → 7887.54] a lot on any of their handhelds we're talking handheld consoles yeah handheld guys handheld
[7888.82 → 7892.90] well people are saying phones are handhelds which is okay I'm talking about
[7894.18 → 7896.58] not a category naming is hard okay come on
[7896.58 → 7910.82] uh um yeah i i I don't think I don't think so none that I'm aware of Maddie ch said how about
[7910.82 → 7916.34] security with those EVS it's an it's a complicated question because i I understand what you're saying
[7916.34 → 7923.46] but then at the same time we have like tesla very obviously abusing the cameras on their cars so it's like
[7923.46 → 7928.18] who do you want taking your driving data and your cameras yeah they're getting super punished for it
[7928.18 → 7937.30] though for sure that's like definitely happening so okay it's like you're you're you're definitely
[7937.30 → 7944.02] this is why I really like my dumb car um and I hope to keep dumb cars because like you don't need that
[7944.02 → 7950.10] you can go away but then yeah, but then that means you're going gas pretty much yeah the thing is if you
[7950.10 → 7956.74] want to be credibly seen as the good guy instead of the other guy you have to behave like one so
[7957.54 → 7966.74] yeah, yeah good job everybody anyway back to the legion go 2 it uses AMD's dozen z2 and z2 extreme
[7966.74 → 7976.82] Apus with radon 890m graphics 32 gigs of LP DDR 8002 terabytes of storage a whopping 74 watt-hour
[7976.82 → 7981.94] battery and will continue to have removable controllers similar to Nintendo Switch with
[7981.94 → 7988.10] two USB 4 ports so you can simultaneously charge and hook up to like an e GPU or something as well
[7988.10 → 7996.02] as a micro SD card slot it is expected to launch around the same time as the Xbox x rogue ally x whatever
[7996.02 → 8007.54] that thing is called in October uh the oh, oh the one with the base z2 chip will launch for 1100 us dollars
[8007.54 → 8014.10] with the extreme chip launching for 1349
[8014.10 → 8025.46] that's a lot to put that in perspective the z2 chip looks like it is going to suck sweaty donkey balls
[8026.26 → 8034.82] so for you to get like the new faster one the z2 extreme you will be spending like actual desktop
[8034.82 → 8044.58] like with a monitor and some nice peripherals money uh okay our discussion question from Mr Elijah horner
[8044.58 → 8050.02] is the handheld market is booming with so many companies now making second or third or fourth
[8050.02 → 8056.26] revisions I mean how many into it is into or God at this point why is the steam deck 2 taking so
[8056.26 → 8064.50] long well Elijah young man that you are this is the thing about valve yeah lack of experience
[8064.50 → 8072.02] is I think the answer on this one um let me familiarize you with valve time
[8075.54 → 8089.46] ahem valve time october 1997 actual time september 1998 valve time four days actual time two months
[8089.46 → 8104.90] and six days valve time 20 minutes actual time 40 minutes
[8109.06 → 8115.06] valve time soon real time cancelled after 10 years
[8115.06 → 8121.06] just be happy if you ever get a steam deck 2
[8126.18 → 8131.62] and i kind of suspect we will at this point but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it's going to be
[8131.62 → 8140.02] three more years yeah I do i i I mean we've been waiting for steam OS to just have an installer for just like any computer
[8140.02 → 8146.10] literally since before they even launched the steam deck like this is just this is just the valve way
[8146.10 → 8151.46] and you know what when they execute on it, it'll probably be great, and they'll get to it when they
[8151.46 → 8159.62] get to it damn it and you'll like it yep uh okay oh, oh we got another one for this week oh this is fun
[8160.18 → 8167.14] open AI has confirmed it reads your chats last week we discussed a recent open AI blog post that announced
[8167.14 → 8173.70] that announced ChatGPT's new parental controls feature futurism noted that the post seemed to
[8173.70 → 8180.18] subtly admit that ChatGPT scans your conversations and may refer them to law enforcement
[8183.14 → 8184.98] okay um
[8187.46 → 8192.74] some of the response online has argued that directing police to individuals in mental crisis could in some
[8192.74 → 8199.06] cases do more harm than good this past June open AI claimed a court order to retain data for a new
[8199.06 → 8205.06] York times lawsuit went against the privacy commitments it had made with users and yet this seems to conflict
[8205.06 → 8211.22] with their tacit admission that they scan your conversations and may refer them to law enforcement so
[8212.26 → 8218.02] open AI has some spleen to do, and most mainstream users are going to completely ignore this and continue to
[8218.02 → 8224.98] pour absolutely everything about themselves into ChatGPT once again good luck everybody
[8228.42 → 8234.82] hey are we ever going to get an all good news when show Luke is it ever going to happen I don't think
[8234.82 → 8240.58] so i I think we might actually be able to like really force one if we want to um, and it might be
[8240.58 → 8248.26] worth doing um but I'm going to yet again I can't share my screen um but I can't, I can't recommend
[8248.26 → 8253.54] this video enough I've recommended it before Linus knows the one I'm going to say, but there's a Wendell
[8253.54 → 8257.46] video that's getting a little bit older at this point aren't we all
[8261.62 → 8265.38] it's about a month old um it's called AI and you against the machine
[8265.38 → 8272.66] guide so you can own big AI uh go watch that it's awesome you can run these models locally and then
[8272.66 → 8281.14] opening I can't read your stuff um this is the way so I know it's expensive now might not be
[8281.14 → 8286.02] the time but I think you should be informed and know what's going on um even if that just makes it so
[8286.02 → 8291.14] that if you're in conversation with someone who could um that they might be able to get that happening
[8291.14 → 8297.30] um whether that's a boss at your work or I don't know maybe someone at your school um
[8298.58 → 8302.02] could be interesting to be informed of that conversation and potentially be able to drive
[8302.66 → 8311.06] some change so check it out hey Dan how close are we to the finale
[8313.46 → 8320.90] uh have you gotten an update let's check project comes nice what do we have mark is watching
[8320.90 → 8328.74] it now that was two minutes ago so I think it's in final QC I think it's in the middle of being
[8328.74 → 8337.30] processed let me check on the internet dude Luke have you seen any drafts of part four
[8337.30 → 8343.30] the finale no nope I watched nobody's shared me early drafts on any of them I've just been watching
[8343.30 → 8349.22] them on flow plane as they come out it's an absolute which is fine banger do not post oh yeah scrapyard
[8349.22 → 8359.70] wars x is the clarification of the thing included uh I don't think we will be able to discuss
[8359.70 → 8372.66] that without oh, oh of yes, yes okay cool yeah that's that's it yeah good enough I think they
[8372.66 → 8380.98] actually did a pretty good job of laying out the various things and various outcomes and and and
[8380.98 → 8387.62] all the kinds of things that were hinged I don't want any spoilers but apparently Sammy wants us
[8387.62 → 8394.18] without spoiling the results talk about how we felt about this year's scrapyard wars Luke to answer
[8395.14 → 8400.34] I'm just I'm just reading the notes from the float plane to answer me specifically yeah I don't I don't
[8400.34 → 8404.42] know what he's getting at though so it's hard for me to kind of guide you towards the right things
[8404.42 → 8409.14] that you're supposed to talk about here yeah that's tough I don't really know what to say here
[8409.14 → 8414.74] uh just because I don't want to ruin anything um yeah maybe you don't have to say anything then if
[8414.74 → 8422.34] you just feel like you know anything you say canon will be used against you in a court of spoilers then
[8422.34 → 8427.38] just don't do it I mean okay I guess I can talk about the episodes that are I can kind of talk about the
[8427.38 → 8434.82] episodes that are already out um i I talked before anybody saw any episode about how like insane that
[8434.82 → 8443.46] week was for me um and I don't think this is like my best scrapyard war showing as an individual people
[8443.46 → 8452.10] on my team did well and i i I think that was cool i I think my contributions were less than I would
[8452.10 → 8459.06] have hoped um that they were going to be um even watching it back like I've had some people comment
[8459.06 → 8465.94] be like oh you did great and then I go watch it I'm like no there's definitely things that I could
[8465.94 → 8472.82] have and should have done better um I did notice I did notice some cheating um from you guys in the
[8472.82 → 8477.22] last episode excuse me we didn't cheat on anything what are you talking about I noticed some cheating i
[8477.22 → 8483.06] noticed go ahead tell me what there was a particular rule that you had to go out in pairs
[8483.78 → 8492.42] yeah um, and you could ask her for an exception okay yeah so we did what is even the
[8492.42 → 8497.46] point I mean we got exceptions too but what is even the point of rules what are you talking about what
[8497.46 → 8501.54] are you even doing we got exceptions too we got sections too I'm not if you got an exception then it
[8501.54 → 8507.46] I mean it is what it is its all good yeah dude we followed the rules I didn't want any false
[8507.46 → 8512.58] accusations like with scrapyard wars 9 so we thought was not a false accusation that was not a false
[8512.58 → 8519.14] accusation that was BS 100 false that was BS you absolutely cheated we followed I didn't we followed
[8519.14 → 8529.06] the rules trash to a t we followed the rules respected them even respected them
[8529.06 → 8535.54] because we had a person on our team who was um
[8537.54 → 8545.70] yeah our driving situation was interesting I'll say that much i I mean yeah i you know what look i uh i all
[8546.58 → 8546.82] hey
[8546.82 → 8551.86] uh
[8551.86 → 8552.26] uh
[8552.26 → 8552.82] uh
[8552.82 → 8553.62] I like cars
[8555.06 → 8557.54] I like cars I like turtles you know
[8559.54 → 8564.26] yeah yeah i we might just have to save our conversation for after you guys uh
[8564.26 → 8567.22] we'll hold it we'll stop there we'll hold it yeah um
[8570.58 → 8576.02] yeah i uh, uh you know what I'm going to have to do the float plane announcement now, and then we'll, we'll
[8576.02 → 8582.18] just have to post it shortly after when show ends then okay Dan hey I'm not the people who'll be
[8582.18 → 8590.90] crying um they're not here anyway okay so early access for scrapyard wars 10 part four will go up
[8590.90 → 8596.50] tonight um as soon as we are able to and as an added bonus on September 9th
[8596.50 → 8602.50] David is going to be doing director's commentary live with some of the participants and with our
[8602.50 → 8609.62] lead editor for each episode exclusively on float plane if you want to know a little bit more about
[8609.62 → 8615.06] two-time participant Sammy her meet the team video just went up talking about her work at labs and
[8615.06 → 8622.34] creator warehouse so you can go check that out on float plane we also have lots of extras including
[8622.34 → 8629.30] one that I'm glad went up because uh there was some discussion on the Subreddit that Linus is the
[8629.30 → 8635.70] kind of guy who just like shows up on set, and you know kind of like a home makeover show you know
[8635.70 → 8640.18] holds a paintbrush for two seconds, and then you know goes away and sits in his trailer or whatever
[8640.18 → 8648.58] uh fortunately in the extras for part three um that accusation was put to rest because I can clearly be
[8648.58 → 8656.90] seen oh sorry I can clearly be seen painting the entire room from start to finish working on it the
[8656.90 → 8662.98] entire time because no I actually do work here you but not even in the extras in just the normal
[8662.98 → 8667.78] footage there was enough to show that you were doing all of that in my opinion that's a crazy
[8667.78 → 8673.62] accusation I don't know man it's just yeah I didn't have that's nuts like i I watched both because I think the
[8673.62 → 8678.74] extras have been fantastic but yeah just like what are you even talking about there's so much
[8678.74 → 8684.42] footage of you painting uh my takeaway was like oh interesting he spent that entire day painting
[8685.30 → 8691.54] just watching like the normal episode yep that was basically all I did for an entire day which
[8691.54 → 8696.90] and added a lot to the room I think that was a good move but like that my immediate takeaway was
[8696.90 → 8702.98] yeah he just painted for a long time yeah anyway uh if you want to know there's a bit nah if you want
[8702.98 → 8706.74] to be the first to know and have insider knowledge on this year's scrapyard wars join float plane at
[8706.74 → 8714.82] leg.GG float plane and the final episode of this uh this series will come out I'm getting an eta now
[8715.38 → 8721.70] soon on YouTube as well all right Dan uh time for some merch messages sure we're already there that
[8721.70 → 8731.62] sounds great let's see I push this button I'm going to get my phone magnetics says c-suite prerogative I'll
[8731.62 → 8738.10] damn well spend the day painting if I want to look i just I think Luke and I are both the kind of person
[8738.10 → 8746.10] who no matter how meaningless the competition is we will do whatever it takes no matter how small the
[8746.10 → 8755.38] prize is we will move heaven and earth to win for glory like it's uh I don't know just like I wouldn't
[8755.38 → 8763.62] think of myself as like a mean loser or like a sore winner necessarily like I'll do i I loved I love
[8763.62 → 8769.78] me some trash talk um but I'd like to think it's you know it's always in it's always in good fun but i
[8769.78 → 8777.70] just i love the spirit of competition um and yeah Luke's like exactly the same way so you know if it
[8777.70 → 8785.54] involved just doing some kind of horrible task have no doubt that either of us would do it to win a
[8785.54 → 8796.82] worthless trophy yeah, yeah pretty much yeah dad to do anything for the l um it is like almost it
[8796.82 → 8804.58] almost honestly yeah I don't know it's probably almost parabolic where like if it is if it is the
[8804.58 → 8812.82] most meaningless thing oh yeah same same same if it's like oh you can win like uh you know
[8812.82 → 8819.86] a 10 or a 15 flash drive I feel like I would try less than if it was like a plastic fake 3d printed
[8819.86 → 8828.10] trophy I think I would probably you know kill live on camera if is the price was just a firm handshake
[8828.10 → 8836.50] from Linus a maria says a thousand dollars and like your own private island it sounds like effort
[8836.50 → 8842.02] a maria says the competition if it were more serious it wouldn't even be fun I watch it for
[8842.02 → 8848.42] the dedication to the lowest possible stakes yeah yeah yeah yeah dude, but you don't
[8848.42 → 8854.42] understand how important the trophy is oh my gosh I didn't even know that was the trophy to be perfectly
[8854.42 → 8858.74] honest I didn't know there was going to be a trophy to the end I thought it was just like an uh
[8858.74 → 8865.86] like a win yay um next video do we have uh any merch messages Mr Dan yeah sorry to get distracted
[8866.42 → 8874.34] l and the tips I was made the CTO of my organization and nominated as a distinguished engineer I mean
[8874.98 → 8884.10] that's not even a weird flex all right heck yeah um the expert in my field if float plane labs
[8884.10 → 8892.66] et cetera had DE's then for what tech what if each of you made a de I don't know what somewhere I thought
[8892.66 → 8898.58] it was somewhere yeah what if each of you were made a DE somewhere like what would you be the
[8898.58 → 8907.38] distinguished engineer in like the expert in your field um I don't know I'm I'm an all-rounder I'm I'm
[8907.38 → 8915.78] a jack of all trades um you know what there that's my de I'd be the DE in distilling uh jargon
[8917.06 → 8924.42] like i I don't know if there's many people who do that quite pretty good like I do I'll, I'll sit I'll
[8924.42 → 8933.22] talk to engineers I'll the actual de's and absorb just enough of it to regurgitate it back and have them
[8933.22 → 8940.10] go oh, oh yeah oh yeah no that's probably the best way I've heard that explained by someone who
[8940.10 → 8947.22] didn't do an entire post-doctorate degree in this um good job and I'll be like thanks I have now
[8947.22 → 8952.10] forgotten all of it so as long as the as long as the words on the page are right, and you say they're
[8952.10 → 8955.06] right we're good that's my superpower
[8955.06 → 8964.82] man I don't know if I have an answer for this um so much of what I do these days is just like
[8965.46 → 8969.78] insert miscellaneous management tasks um
[8969.78 → 8973.78] um
[8979.22 → 8986.18] I like to think that I'm good at getting people to kind of like rally behind a banner so like
[8987.54 → 8993.54] alignment I guess motivation yeah sure I'll go with that
[8993.54 → 9003.86] okay up next are you talking to me too they asked you oh I don't make the rules troubleshooting that's
[9003.86 → 9016.58] mine I like that why broke you know what yeah yeah yeah channel broken why broke
[9016.58 → 9023.94] yeah sound broken power broken here fix do this throw out by trace broken
[9025.94 → 9032.34] if only I could figure out why life broken up next hi that's not happy
[9034.18 → 9041.54] hi LLD it's like cobbler's children right my shoes are bad hi LLD with many devices that were purchased
[9041.54 → 9046.10] during the pandemic now aging out of schools and businesses what are your thoughts on the future of
[9046.10 → 9048.90] e-waste in North America what future
[9051.30 → 9059.06] it's an it's a crisis it's an enormous problem, and it's exacerbated by a trend towards less and less
[9059.06 → 9065.78] repairable and reconstructible right like modern like touch screens I actually didn't become aware of
[9065.78 → 9071.78] what an ecological disaster touch screens were sorry I should say environmental not necessarily
[9071.78 → 9078.18] ecology um but what an environmental disaster touch screens were until quite recently because
[9078.18 → 9083.14] the way that they're laminated and fused uh makes them much more difficult to separate into their
[9083.14 → 9090.82] constituent parts apparently um yeah it's its an it's a catastrophe and one that humanity will
[9090.82 → 9094.26] probably not end up having to deal with because we'll be dead
[9100.02 → 9102.90] what's the weirdest sponsor request you've had to turn down
[9104.58 → 9109.54] oh man what's the weirdest sponsor request you've had to turn down see I was trying to think
[9109.54 → 9119.46] like maybe something from brand but i basically never really say no to them so yeah yeah i hmm you
[9119.46 → 9127.22] know I think this is going to be one that we we we like reached out to them to see if they would do it
[9127.22 → 9135.30] and then they were enthusiastically down, and then we decided to not do it does that count do you know
[9135.30 → 9141.14] what one I'm talking about no I don't but i i have one Mr Colton potter potentially on the line
[9141.14 → 9147.30] here I'm going to try him sure I'm going to dm you the one that I'm talking about you can decide to say it if
[9147.30 → 9155.30] you're the person wow sent to voicemail after only two and a half rings well I know where we stand Mr potter
[9157.62 → 9165.54] I just dm'd it to you oh uh the um if you want to mention it or not oh yeah sure I don't know yeah
[9165.54 → 9171.54] sure go with that I didn't even remember that I don't remember the context of it yeah I don't remember
[9171.54 → 9178.66] like what sparked it but way back in the day can I say the name is that just say the hub name
[9179.38 → 9185.38] okay sure um there was some reason why we were thinking about doing something, and we thought
[9185.38 → 9191.70] it would be funny if we got it sponsored by the hub um, and they actually responded, and we're like yeah
[9191.70 → 9197.78] we're down uh, and we didn't really expect that response, and then we were like oh wait this is like
[9197.78 → 9204.26] real are we actually doing this and then and then the decision was not so we had to be like oh never
[9204.26 → 9212.66] mind sorry that's lame which is kind of like quintessential nerd in that scenario I think so
[9212.66 → 9220.34] maybe that makes sense hey do you want to go on a date yeah uh um uh no you're too pretty bye
[9220.34 → 9227.94] yeah basically um yeah I don't remember what the deal was that was like it's not in my inbox
[9229.06 → 9233.78] no this is ancient yeah but like my inbox goes back to the start of the company smart guy
[9234.50 → 9238.98] no yeah for sure see I'm not used to that because someone deleted the inbox for float plane
[9238.98 → 9247.06] um I don't know who that was yeah you inbox for float plane remember we had float plane club emails and
[9247.06 → 9252.58] then you just like randomly deleted it one day I don't remember why we did that oh right because
[9252.58 → 9257.38] we didn't want to keep paying for them forever yeah yeah I remember that we were partially
[9257.38 → 9262.18] migrated but not fully migrated, and you just needed the whole thing yeah yeah that was my bad
[9262.18 → 9268.18] we lost like a bunch of history yeahs that was my bad it's fine I mean it's basically resolved at this
[9268.18 → 9273.86] point but um I am used to liking things from that era just assuming that I don't have them so yeah my bad but
[9273.86 → 9279.30] yeah this was I think this was done through Colton and I think any discussions with you would have been
[9280.02 → 9285.22] vocal at that point in time yeah okay sorry I can't find any reference to it that's freaking
[9285.22 → 9293.54] hilarious though it was either them or someone very like them and i really I don't remember i
[9293.54 → 9301.30] wonder if it was like how to hide your stuff that is on the hub video um I don't think it was that
[9301.30 → 9306.26] time frame wouldn't it would it have been like channel super fun the dildo racing maybe
[9307.30 → 9312.10] I think it was a little bit after that okay but i I was going to bring that video up because I think
[9312.10 → 9316.10] it might have been something like kind of inspired by I really don't know what it was it's been too
[9316.10 → 9322.42] long it's like literally been a decade basically um but that was a thing we reached out to them
[9322.42 → 9330.34] they said sure whoever it was I think it was them um, and then we said no it's amazing how many people
[9330.34 → 9335.14] are relatively new to the channel and just like have no idea what channel super fun is this
[9335.14 → 9340.18] float plane chats just like lighting up with what racing uh yeah that was a video on channel
[9340.18 → 9345.54] super fun way back in the day um i got a text from my daughter that actually reminded me of
[9345.54 → 9350.10] this is totally unrelated to anything but remember that cool text that I showed you from her a little
[9350.10 → 9357.22] while back where I was like this is such a proud dad moment guys this is so cool um i got a text
[9357.22 → 9363.54] from her like middle of last month that was I fixed the printer all by myself today for the first time
[9363.54 → 9370.10] yes exclamation mark exclamation mark she goes a piece of filament was stuck um dude
[9371.30 → 9377.46] it worked so cool it freaking paid off the Christmas present for like the big one for the whole
[9377.46 → 9386.34] family I want to say two Christmases ago now was a bamboo labs printer p1s and then a few AMS's because
[9386.34 → 9393.06] the idea that I had in my head was that in particular my daughters who I recognized
[9393.06 → 9400.02] immediately were going to just use it as a toy factory uh we're going to eventually run into
[9400.02 → 9404.50] enough problems that I was eventually going to lose patience with fixing it for them
[9405.46 → 9410.50] to the point where they were going to have to start learning how to manage it themselves, and they were
[9410.50 → 9416.26] going to run out of already prefabbed creations that they could just print and get to the point
[9416.26 → 9420.66] where they were going to have to start learning to model stuff, and it's freaking happening it took about
[9421.54 → 9433.62] yeah uh about 20 months, but it's flipping happening my eldest daughter can do some basic 3d printer repair
[9433.62 → 9441.38] including taking out stuck filament um she can take the full extruder head assembly off of it and replace it
[9442.42 → 9447.46] honestly what's more important about that in my opinion is that she was really excited and proud
[9447.46 → 9454.10] about doing so which means that she will probably continue to she got that dopamine hit yes she got
[9454.10 → 9463.62] that's a very important component yes she has learned to troubleshoot she achieved something and she
[9463.62 → 9469.86] got the secondary dopamine hit of being able to use the printer to make something she wanted she's already
[9469.86 → 9475.62] starting to do a little bit of basic modelling and that's influencing my youngest daughter to want to
[9475.62 → 9481.06] be just like her big sister like they tend to do, and she's trying to do a little bit as well um dude
[9481.06 → 9487.54] absolutely freaking stoked it freaking happened um Tyler asks did your son ever decide if he wants to be
[9487.54 → 9494.34] in more Ltd videos um actually yeah he expressed some interest over the course of the summer, and he is
[9494.34 → 9505.14] currently in the first um or second draft phase of a Kindle video so I basically told him look I don't mind
[9505.14 → 9510.34] a little bit of light nepotism but the way that it's going to work is if you want to
[9511.06 → 9517.62] you know do anything that isn't just as my son you're going to have to you're going to have to shovel
[9517.62 → 9525.70] some if you know what I mean, and so I basically picked the least glamorous possible assignment
[9526.50 → 9532.66] uh which it turns out on the docket was a look at the latest kindles including the colour kindle
[9532.66 → 9541.94] and I went okay here are some basic guardrails of you know sort of where to go for information yourself
[9542.50 → 9548.10] um other publications that have covered it just you know to learn what their thoughts were but think
[9548.10 → 9555.78] for yourself um customer reviews filtering out of course that you know inexperienced reviewers slash
[9555.78 → 9562.42] people who don't have other devices for contacts slash bots paid reviewers might be muddying the
[9562.42 → 9567.78] waters there here's what people might want to know you know it's what's good about it what's bad about
[9567.78 → 9572.58] it what's complicated about it don't forget about price blah blah blah i kind of laid out all these
[9572.58 → 9579.06] things and I went okay dump it all in a dock and again a little bit of light nepotism uh one of our
[9579.06 → 9585.22] experienced writers will look at your first draft with you and actually proof said it was not bad I haven't
[9585.22 → 9591.30] looked at it yet because he went through the first three four paragraphs sort of showed my son okay
[9591.30 → 9596.82] here's what you need to tweak here's what's pretty good he kind of went yeah you know it reads like a
[9596.82 → 9604.66] 13-year-old wrote it but a good 13-year-old um I sent him back to the kitchen, and he's currently working
[9604.66 → 9609.70] on draft two which will then go into script review with me, so this will be my first time actually seeing
[9609.70 → 9614.42] the script and I have resolved to have absolutely no mercy if it's something that I would have changed with
[9614.42 → 9621.46] one of our writers I'll change it um and I basically told him that the most that he gets to do in this
[9621.46 → 9627.22] because again he's got to shovel some is he gets to host a little bit of it so he might host a segment
[9627.22 → 9633.70] or two uh, but he's writing a video for the LTT channel, and it will either be good enough, and we'll
[9633.70 → 9638.26] actually use it, or it won't be good enough and I'll look at his resume again in another year or two
[9638.90 → 9643.94] it's kind of where we're at on it sure now that's it we were talking about the dopamine hits and the
[9643.94 → 9649.62] and the desire for more situation with the repairing of the printer um when he received
[9649.62 → 9656.10] that feedback from proof um was he motivated did he did he get to it did he start working on
[9656.10 → 9663.46] it right yeah he's working on it positive I've seen I've seen him working on it nice yeah that's exciting
[9663.46 → 9670.50] I'm hearing good positive things about this video potentially arriving soon
[9671.86 → 9677.30] oh uh well while that potentially happens five or six minutes yeah cool more okay well we should try
[9677.30 → 9681.38] to get through the rest of the merch messages then so we can time it for the end of the show yeah
[9681.38 → 9687.54] hello short shorter and shortest like the pizza warmer what other not stellar videos would you like
[9687.54 → 9697.30] to completely redo my blackberry review well late for that yeah too bad you sunk them Luke
[9701.22 → 9704.66] I miss my blackberry oh no
[9707.46 → 9711.46] man I don't know maybe you guys will be able to tell me what were what are my worst videos which
[9711.46 → 9720.74] ones should I redo hit me the apology video yeah yeah yeah that'd be a pretty good one
[9720.74 → 9722.18] hey your next one you'll get right
[9726.26 → 9732.58] you know what I don't think so I don't think so Dan i think the next time a major scandal rolls
[9732.58 → 9739.70] our way yeah I'm just going to be like it deal with it actually based i would support that i i i just
[9739.70 → 9745.78] think I'm over it at this point like no ukulele no nothing just like yeah okay whatever bye there's
[9745.78 → 9754.26] been so many attempts to cancel my career that I'm just like I'm over it at this point like look
[9754.98 → 9763.06] next time go for the head and if you don't hit it then give up go home remember what the last one was
[9763.06 → 9769.06] but I remember I was like our doing stuff on the weekend and one of my friends messaged me like oh my
[9769.06 → 9774.18] god this thing is happening and i i i if I remember correctly you and i both were basically just
[9774.18 → 9783.38] like yeah we'll, we'll get to it when we're back in office it's like it's fine whatever uh
[9785.30 → 9789.38] sometimes the internet's gonna internet what else we got your worst videos are
[9790.74 → 9794.26] building pcs you can only do that so many times well then why would you tell me to redo it
[9794.26 → 9800.50] uh remake the first video with no AI yeah I don't know you guys aren't really giving me much here
[9801.86 → 9808.74] survivor slug cat says one that needs a remake is the Christmas album no it doesn't if anything i
[9808.74 → 9814.90] think over the last little while we've gotten less musical so no I don't think that's a very good idea
[9817.38 → 9817.94] interesting
[9824.26 → 9831.70] is that true for like the oh I thought you were going to continue with another one nope uh hi leg
[9831.70 → 9838.10] I just got a brand-new monitor with HDR functionality nice whenever I turn it on it looks weird is that
[9838.10 → 9846.18] just me why do people turn on HDR I love the magnetic cable organization and bottle ah okay windows
[9846.98 → 9853.14] HDR can sometimes be a little bit funky I actually encountered it earlier today sometimes you turn
[9853.14 → 9859.86] on HDR in windows, and it's like pretty darn looking like it kind of should at the desktop and then other
[9859.86 → 9865.06] times you turn it on, and it gets like all washed out and horrible looking uh so what you'll have to do
[9865.06 → 9872.26] is you'll have to make sure that your display is only switched into HDR mode uh when you're actually
[9872.26 → 9878.50] playing content that benefits from HDR because even if your desktop looks like hot poo, poo if you go
[9878.50 → 9884.98] into a game that supports HDR and turn HDR on it will look outstanding and then just don't use HDR
[9884.98 → 9895.70] at the desktop I guess win b yeah yeah win b hotkey there's a hockey for that yeah if I recall correctly
[9895.70 → 9903.06] that's sick I'm not going to do it because it might break the computer oh okay I have been given a link
[9903.06 → 9904.18] sorry win alt b
[9908.66 → 9915.22] okay carry on I've been given a link to scrapyard doors so we can post that when we're done yeah when
[9915.22 → 9922.82] we're done good day from Australia Luke the refrigerator you've often said that life is PVP
[9922.82 → 9930.74] as a bloke who seems set on making the world better how do you square that with the life is PVP
[9930.74 → 9937.30] philosophy any tips I would say probably kill them quickly so they don't suffer
[9941.54 → 9947.30] I mean just because it's PVP doesn't mean those other people can't be useful to you, you shouldn't
[9947.30 → 9955.46] just kill them all yeah yeah even like in a PVP enabled world you can have people that can work
[9955.46 → 9962.34] with you um if you think about I mean even if you think about just video games right like if you is
[9962.34 → 9969.70] you think about one of the longest running ones now eve online it's like extremely brutal extremely PVP
[9969.70 → 9975.54] enabled you have internal you'll have like spies that'll steal stuff from groups all the time but that
[9975.54 → 9980.82] doesn't stop people from working together because in order to accomplish more you have to work
[9980.82 → 9989.30] together, and you will find people that are generally going to act in a way that benefits you
[9990.18 → 9996.66] you can argue that effectively every single action like ever made is selfish um, but there can be
[9996.66 → 10002.82] selfish actions that's such a cynical viewpoint yeah it is I agree and I don't think it's realistic
[10002.82 → 10007.94] um but even in that scenario there can be things that people do that are selfish that benefit you
[10008.50 → 10018.18] um, so alignment yeah alignment is very important um and definitely attainable and there are and it
[10018.18 → 10023.38] might not work every time but like it's definitely attainable a lot of people want to be on a team
[10023.38 → 10032.26] and there are positive there are personally positive um results sometimes that align with
[10032.26 → 10038.74] making the world a better place I mean I'd say a great example would be making a good product that
[10038.74 → 10046.74] helps people fix things faster and more comfortably like yes you know this is a PVP world, and you know i
[10046.74 → 10052.82] it was the creation of our screwdriver was capitalistically motivated obviously I don't
[10052.82 → 10059.70] mind selling half a million of them um, but that doesn't mean that that has to be mutually exclusive
[10059.70 → 10066.74] to other people finding a benefit from you know our team's actions and that doesn't mean that other
[10066.74 → 10073.78] people on our team can't benefit from you know the sales of this like it's just i I think you can even
[10073.78 → 10082.02] argue like something like the trust me bro warranty um like the idea of just somewhat automatically
[10082.02 → 10088.66] siding with the customers and trying to make things good for people um is honestly it's so
[10088.66 → 10094.10] multifaceted it's its kind of easier for us the customer service team can just be like less
[10094.10 → 10098.82] contentious than they would have to be at other companies which is probably nice I assume that's nice
[10098.82 → 10104.90] I know for the flow plane customer support that's nice it just makes the approach to a lot of
[10104.90 → 10112.10] situations easy it's like oh you're mad, and you want a refund okay yeah sounds good hopefully you
[10112.10 → 10117.70] uh come back later see ya we've actually caught a lot of people very off guard doing that because they're
[10117.70 → 10123.70] like oh wait really gearing up for a fight yeah and then and then sometimes they end up coming back and
[10123.70 → 10128.74] like messaging us about the fact that they came back which is kind of a funny um way to close that
[10128.74 → 10139.86] loop but the idea that something is good for is good for you therefore it's it must be bad for
[10139.86 → 10145.30] others is not good I think also the idea that something is good for others therefore it must be
[10145.30 → 10151.30] bad for you is a bad way of thinking as well um like someone else gaining a benefit and you not gaining it
[10151.30 → 10158.58] can still mean that that is a good thing overall and supporting that uh i I think if you don't think
[10158.58 → 10164.18] super short-sighted might result in things that are good for you and not necessarily good for them
[10164.18 → 10170.42] happening in the future because if you set that as like the like look we are going to try to do the
[10170.42 → 10178.10] thing that is right as much as possible as the standard that you have um that you will ideally overall
[10178.10 → 10184.82] benefit from that happening i I don't know the whole situation is tough um life is constant PVP i
[10184.82 → 10192.82] think the main thing that you are in PVP with is companies um yes it happens with each other like we
[10192.82 → 10198.18] are yeah absolutely I mean only one person can marry Yvonne which is a total bummer for everyone but me
[10198.18 → 10205.70] from my perspective so you were in constant PVP with everyone else um yeah in your eyes
[10205.70 → 10209.78] well not anymore to getting with Yvonne yeah sure now I don't even have to like to take care of myself
[10210.50 → 10216.66] I would still say yes actually that's fair that's fair there whatever it's like 50 of marriages end
[10216.66 → 10223.86] in divorce or whatever stuff is not zero-sum like that yes um, and you know ideally you end up in a
[10223.86 → 10229.38] situation where it's not really that way but um you also need to keep your guard up like you can't just
[10229.38 → 10235.54] like randomly suck as a husband any more um not any more you can't just randomly suck as a
[10235.54 → 10249.22] husband yeah that would be huge news for her if I came out like that oh my god um but yeah I don't
[10249.22 → 10257.62] know anyway it's its yeah the main thing you need to keep your guard on out for is company stuff uh the
[10257.62 → 10262.26] the concept there's no such thing as a free lunch is like super true, and you should just be aware
[10262.26 → 10269.78] of it um yeah if something's free you're the product and that is very intense I've been talking
[10269.78 → 10277.46] recently about how uh the like what we're paying for is shifting we're like paying to not have things now
[10277.46 → 10284.02] you're paying to not have ads you're paying to not have your data stolen you're paying to not be involved
[10284.02 → 10290.10] in like really brutal um surveillance and data harvesting schemes you're paying to
[10291.14 → 10298.02] avoid these problems yeah um and or like forced labour and products and stuff like that
[10298.82 → 10303.54] sorry or like forced labour in the production of your products like that's an extra
[10304.42 → 10310.50] you know, and it's its a rather extreme extra because that forced labour who is a boy it's real cheap um
[10310.50 → 10318.58] yeah so it's its it's interesting um I think it's also tough because and i I catch myself with
[10318.58 → 10325.06] this as well sometimes but like the things I care about um or like you know I care about a lot of
[10325.06 → 10330.66] things but the things that I decide to action that I care about um it's hard to not try to push other
[10330.66 → 10336.10] people to like definitely just follow the same things that I do and everybody's got their own little wars
[10336.10 → 10343.30] going on um I don't know something about recognizing that life is a constant PVP environment is just
[10343.30 → 10351.14] also recognizing that people are going through it all the time um, and it's tough to know what battles
[10351.14 → 10357.22] somebody is fighting um and that doesn't mean you know you have to be just incredibly lenient with
[10357.22 → 10363.46] everyone all the time but I think it's just sometimes understanding that they're like everyone all the time
[10363.46 → 10369.78] is being bringing an incredible amount of baggage to every single scenario they're ever in you never
[10369.78 → 10375.54] know like why someone reacts to something so intensely, and it's probably because of tons of
[10375.54 → 10382.42] other things going on um that you have really no way of ever understanding so just try to not take
[10382.42 → 10387.38] things too personally keep your head down and understand that basically every company is trying to
[10387.38 → 10394.66] dilute you all the time um hey what did I just get linked here sidecar your personal automotive
[10394.66 → 10403.30] assistant someone just sent this to me in chat uh SID BMW sent this to me apparently the Tynan
[10403.94 → 10413.38] is the top car driven by people who use this app what does it do that's like that's wild there's so
[10413.38 → 10421.54] few Taycans on the road oh never mind I figured it out it warns you about recalls I've had a few of
[10421.54 → 10426.82] those I could see Tynan owners caring about that, and it looks like it helps you uh it looks like it
[10426.82 → 10432.42] helps with trip planning which the Tynan has fantastic range so never mind okay I figured it out okay uh
[10432.42 → 10440.66] Dan next one sure thing um when water bottles was a new product Linus mentioned a known issue with the
[10440.66 → 10445.38] black and gold water bottles that the gold would fade quickly for some users is that just a factor
[10445.38 → 10452.66] of the printing method uh yes, and we have um explored and explored and explored other printing
[10452.66 → 10458.74] methods and have not found a good way for gold paint on the water bottle with the current processes
[10458.74 → 10465.86] and manufacturing that we use to not fade so I think we either removed it from the site or we
[10465.86 → 10471.86] uh just have a disclaimer on it now that we don't cover uh fading of the gold I can't remember which
[10471.86 → 10477.46] one it is at this point uh I'm going to check it looks like we do still have it on the site
[10478.10 → 10484.18] and uh disclaimers gold ink may be more prone to wear and discolouration from skin oils and exposure to
[10484.18 → 10487.70] heat than other colours some fading is normal over the lifetime of the product, and it is not dishwasher
[10487.70 → 10492.58] safe so that's what we ultimately went with because people got mad that's right I remember now people
[10492.58 → 10496.66] got mad when we took it away they wanted the option to have a faded gold bottle, and we were like
[10498.18 → 10504.74] okay oh speaking of which we may have found a coating for the screwdriver shaft
[10507.94 → 10514.90] gold define black a gold coating no black that would be cool oh that'll like actually survive but
[10514.90 → 10520.74] well anything any coating is not invulnerable but a lot better but a lot better than the OG
[10520.74 → 10527.22] uh that's cool that's pretty exciting so yeah i think people would be quite interested
[10527.70 → 10533.94] to see a black shaft return I actually have another merch message about that oh do you really
[10534.50 → 10540.90] um and let me see if I can find it here about black shafts' hi do Linus a couple of weeks ago you
[10540.90 → 10546.34] mentioned you all were almost sold out of fail shafts yep will more scribe drivers come back once you're out
[10546.34 → 10554.34] hopefully black shafts return uh so yeah it was actually the scribe driver that drove us to uh
[10554.34 → 10560.66] re-explore black coatings and look at some of the options re-look at some of the options we'd looked
[10560.66 → 10566.26] at previously but maybe with different partners and then look at some new options that had come to light
[10566.82 → 10572.50] and uh we found one that worked really great on scribe driver and we kind of went well if it works on a
[10572.50 → 10577.54] scribe driver then it should work on a screwdriver because they're like made of the same thing and so
[10577.54 → 10583.62] we've been exploring it we still have not finalized anything with respect to black coatings and whether
[10583.62 → 10590.98] or not that will end up in a product again um, but we do have some promising leads as for scribe driver
[10590.98 → 10596.42] yeah we've talked about it and the team wants to keep making them I mean they continue to sell
[10596.42 → 10603.30] really well like how many scribe drivers did we sell yesterday for instance here I'm gonna I'm gonna
[10603.30 → 10610.66] check I'm going to check you guys uh can be privy to this information yesterday was just a normal
[10610.66 → 10615.94] very normal day on the store like we didn't have any special promos running or anything like that so
[10615.94 → 10625.14] just like a run rate kind of day and oh man the report takes a little while to pull here we go
[10625.14 → 10629.22] scribe driver so we moved like 30 scribe drivers yesterday so it is like just
[10631.30 → 10637.14] sells its great value it's a great product um, so the team's like well yeah like you know this looks
[10637.14 → 10640.90] great on our you know quarterly reports and everything it'd be tremendous if we could keep
[10640.90 → 10648.10] selling it so I think the plan is to manufacture scribe drivers uh even though the intention was
[10648.10 → 10655.62] that we would not even begin to dent the total number of fail shafts that we had making this
[10655.62 → 10660.10] product I mean we had a hundred thousand of them and between scribe driver and another thing that we
[10660.10 → 10665.70] have planned that we're going to do a production run of with fail shafts um before we probably have to
[10665.70 → 10674.42] switch that one over to fresh manufacturing uh we're almost out of them so what if anything I think that's
[10674.42 → 10682.10] it's really, really cool uh because it shows that you can take a recycling project and turn it into
[10682.10 → 10687.94] something so profitable that it's worth doing beyond just recycling and uh just like an awesome story just
[10687.94 → 10693.86] so you guys know we're going to try to give you guys a heads-up when you'll have your last opportunity to
[10693.86 → 10702.58] grab a scribe driver uh before they become like not fail shafts like if you want one that is a piece of
[10702.58 → 10710.02] LTT failure history everything you order today will be a fail shaft from that manufacturer that boned us
[10710.58 → 10716.58] um but at some point they will switch over so if you want to get a pencil or a pen we have both
[10716.58 → 10723.30] mechanical pencils and pens now for a scribe driver now is a great time to get one and be sure that you
[10723.30 → 10732.26] will get a fail shaft hey three musketeers Linus after finding Tahoma podcast I was wondering
[10732.26 → 10738.74] are you still using homey at home if so what have you been enjoying since installation we'll hear
[10738.74 → 10747.46] this tomorrow on Spotify um homey is super cool and when I finally fix all my light switches and get
[10747.46 → 10755.22] everything sort of aligned I may switch over to it but as it was, we did the installation, and we did a bunch
[10755.22 → 10761.30] of tests with if it's like super awesome but I already had what little I have working with home
[10761.30 → 10768.26] assistant, and so I have not switched my home installation however if oh
[10770.74 → 10778.50] if nothing dramatically changes with my home assistant situation I may just go homey we're
[10778.50 → 10784.90] also looking at potentially doing an another house renovation project um this is something that is
[10784.90 → 10789.86] still very early stages and if we were to do something that you know is not intended to be
[10789.86 → 10796.58] administered by someone who feels like doing it as a hobby homey is something that I would strongly
[10797.22 → 10806.58] recommend um it seems like they are pretty serious about making the uh the experience of
[10806.58 → 10812.18] bringing together disparate ecosystems actually palatable for people who don't want to make it their
[10812.18 → 10823.62] part-time job LL and d if you play have you tried the Anna 117 beta if so what do you think I didn't know

[11014.34 → 11023.78] yeah it has been pretty crazy it's been the um the views just deciding to go freaking haywire
[11023.78 → 11033.30] on us was not the best timing in the world I would say um I'm very tired but hey we're still here
[11034.74 → 11041.86] who's vino in chat is that Sven yeah oh okay can't believe you haven't played dq11 what's dq11

[11047.62 → 11051.86] are they like popular I think they're pretty popular because that new like HDD
[11052.42 → 11062.98] HDD uh remake was like huge or something huh, huh and let's see is this one hello uh last one I've got
[11062.98 → 11068.42] for your today oh dang I tried to reply to the one hi Dan before you got to it oh I was going to be like
[11068.42 → 11075.46] psych it's me Linus well I guess it counts as curated now uh as a long time viewer who was
[11075.46 → 11080.10] heavily inspired by you to try and start creating content as a passion project what is the most
[11080.10 → 11086.18] actionable piece of advice you would wish you were told early on much less than three LLD
[11087.38 → 11094.74] um this is a super difficult question I'm sorry to curate this no, no that's fine I mean I'd say that
[11094.74 → 11103.14] the advice that I wish I had back then is actually really accessible now because the whole content
[11103.14 → 11109.14] creation as a career thing didn't exist when I started on YouTube at least in the way that we
[11109.14 → 11113.94] think of what content creator means now obviously creating any content makes you a content creator
[11113.94 → 11121.62] but like online content creation was not a career when I first got started and so you know there weren't
[11121.62 → 11131.94] really a ton of trailblazers that came before me there were some um you know people like Chris peril lo
[11131.94 → 11141.54] um people like i Justine um but nowadays, there's so much conversation around you know what it takes to
[11141.54 → 11148.66] succeed that on the one hand you know the formula is really well understood you know be yourself and
[11148.66 → 11155.30] engage with the audience and be persistent and always be you know evolving, and you know all
[11155.30 → 11159.70] these things that you know everyone knows because you can just go watch Mr beast interview, and he'll
[11159.70 → 11164.50] break it down for you, he's he's very transparent in terms of what it takes to succeed on the platform
[11164.50 → 11169.94] it's just that the flip side of this coin is that the competition is so fierce now that it comes down to
[11169.94 → 11180.90] who can most expertly execute on that formula and who can find a manner of engaging with that audience
[11180.90 → 11185.30] that is that lasts um because that's the biggest challenge I mean I was talking about this a fair
[11185.30 → 11190.18] bit last week, and it was something that I was reflecting on a lot um when we thought okay well
[11190.18 → 11194.50] that's it like you know we've fallen off right our views are gone um then we turned around and had a
[11194.50 → 11199.86] couple you know 1.5 1.6 million view videos I'm like okay I guess meets back on the menu who knows
[11199.86 → 11207.30] right but I was thinking a lot about you know if this was the end how privileged I've been to survive
[11207.30 → 11213.46] this long in this industry so long I really do think of it as survival there's not many people that
[11214.10 → 11220.34] and I've never been you know at the s tier or even the plus tier, but there's not many people that
[11220.34 → 11229.06] have been at the b plus a minus tier like I have for this long and um it's a slog so I guess I'll
[11229.06 → 11235.70] say this is the most actual piece of advice that even now most people don't like to talk about is that
[11235.70 → 11246.50] it is a slog we are not designed as creatures to have a one to this many relationships, and it is something
[11246.50 → 11254.82] that wears on to have a spot glass on literally such an incredibly high percentage of your time
[11255.54 → 11262.34] by so many people all the time and be expected to be perfect all the time, and it's something
[11262.34 → 11270.98] that wears on the viewers as well people grow people change people drift apart, and it's um
[11271.78 → 11278.98] it's a weird relationship that as far as I can tell has never existed before and who knows maybe
[11278.98 → 11284.34] we'll learn something from it and this type of dynamic will never exist again, but you've got to
[11284.34 → 11293.06] be ready to grow a thick skin and understand that like any job it's work don't romanticize it
[11293.06 → 11301.78] you have a job to do so you know when the numbers are bad or when a comment is discouraging you're
[11301.78 → 11305.94] just going to have to put your chin up, and you're going to have to just figure it out because otherwise
[11305.94 → 11313.94] you will not survive period yeah just like this show will not continue to survive well this
[11313.94 → 11319.86] episode well we got the flow plane oh right it's a top of the script I tried to outro the video and
[11319.86 → 11327.94] you didn't let me denied it will survive slightly longer sorry the top of the script uh yellow sorry
