[0.00 → 10.52] What's up everyone?
[11.04 → 12.68] Welcome to the WAN show.
[12.90 → 16.12] We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[16.20 → 18.96] We're going to be talking about, oh boy, everything.
[20.32 → 21.18] And nothing.
[21.54 → 22.88] It's been a rough week.
[22.88 → 23.28] Yeah.
[24.14 → 28.18] Framework is pausing some U.S. sales due to tariff uncertainty.
[28.56 → 29.70] And it's not just them.
[30.56 → 34.36] Racer has taken down pricing and pre-order pages for new blades.
[34.80 → 37.22] Other laptop vendors are doing all kinds of stuff.
[37.30 → 41.52] Nintendo has suspended pre-orders of the Switch 2 in the U.S. and Canada.
[41.78 → 43.36] We're going to be talking a little bit about that.
[43.56 → 49.66] We're also going to be talking about how this is quite probably going to affect LTT store as well.
[49.66 → 54.18] Which is why we have a major Beat the Shitstorm.
[54.50 → 55.08] Get it?
[55.38 → 56.10] The Shitstorm.
[56.48 → 58.20] Beat the Shitstorm sale event.
[58.30 → 58.56] I'm talking...
[58.56 → 58.96] I don't.
[59.02 → 59.50] Can you explain?
[59.50 → 72.56] Free shipping on all orders over $150 plus a never-before-seen deal on the MCM Essentials solution with our magnetic cable management for almost 50% off.
[72.64 → 75.06] So we've got lots of great stuff going on the store this week.
[75.30 → 75.94] What are you talking about that?
[75.94 → 80.82] That probably means you could get that another item and get the other item and free shipping both for free.
[81.58 → 82.26] If you think about it.
[82.42 → 84.48] Well, hopefully they won't think of that.
[84.76 → 85.00] Nice.
[85.00 → 85.86] What else we got this week?
[86.50 → 89.58] Turns out the XT was inside us all along.
[89.68 → 93.18] Apparently people are BIOS modding the 90-70, and it's an interesting story.
[93.18 → 94.50] Also, events!
[94.86 → 100.22] Jace2Sense is having a tech fair thing, and we're maybe talking about Whale Land stuff?
[100.64 → 100.92] Yeah.
[101.08 → 101.42] Events.
[101.56 → 102.10] Lots of events.
[102.18 → 102.36] Yeah.
[104.00 → 104.54] Shitstorm.
[104.82 → 105.04] Event.
[105.40 → 105.68] Yeah.
[105.68 → 105.78] Yeah.
[105.78 → 129.68] The show is brought to you today by Messi, Odom, and AMD.
[129.68 → 136.18] Also, our wrap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[137.72 → 141.24] Oh, should we get right into the situation this week?
[141.58 → 141.80] Sure.
[142.02 → 148.56] Framework, investment disclosure, has paused some U.S. sales due to tariff uncertainty.
[148.56 → 155.84] On Wednesday, Framework announced a temporary pause on U.S. sales on some base Framework Laptop 13 models,
[155.84 → 162.58] specifically the Core Ultra 5 125H and Ry zen 5 7640U.
[163.08 → 169.94] Framework explained that even a 10% tariff would mean they are selling their lowest-end SKUs at a loss.
[170.44 → 177.46] Framework also paused all pre-orders for the Laptop 12, but have since unpaused all but the base models.
[177.46 → 186.34] And personally, I found this whole thing fascinating because we've been able to get, over the last couple of weeks,
[186.86 → 192.26] insight into the margin structures of these companies that we otherwise wouldn't have gotten.
[192.74 → 197.86] Basically, I mean, when Logitech increased the price of that mouse, when Framework basically went,
[198.10 → 202.50] look, if we sell this thing, we're just going to be eating it on every unit we ship.
[202.50 → 209.98] It told us explicitly what the margins are on these products, and I've got to say, I'm feeling a little validated.
[210.42 → 219.96] Because I've talked for years on this show, for years, about how one of the biggest problems for the tech industry is that there is no margin in it.
[219.96 → 227.08] I will admit, I knew that the margin on some components was really, really, really, really low.
[227.54 → 231.16] I knew that things like cases, fans, it gets a little bit healthier.
[231.40 → 232.44] Power supply is a little bit healthier.
[233.48 → 235.52] I thought laptops had more.
[236.08 → 238.40] The laptop industry is cutthroat.
[238.56 → 239.00] Apparently.
[239.66 → 240.12] Cutthroat.
[240.12 → 245.66] I remember back when I worked at the best of buys, selling laptops and stuff like that.
[245.66 → 246.32] I heard they're the best.
[247.00 → 247.72] They've got to be.
[247.76 → 248.12] It's in the name.
[248.94 → 256.10] I remember seeing the cost, because you could see the cost in your system, and it was always really close to the actual amount we were selling it for.
[257.62 → 260.28] But it was my understanding that through like...
[260.28 → 260.64] Skiffs.
[261.12 → 262.92] Skiffs, kickbacks, other various things.
[262.94 → 263.36] MDF.
[263.36 → 270.02] It made it a lot better, and we just didn't see that amount, because we were allowed to show the customer the cost.
[270.42 → 273.92] So I was like, the fact that we are allowed to do that means there's some play here somewhere.
[274.86 → 280.04] However, what I can tell you is that that invoiced cost may have very well been fairly accurate.
[280.22 → 280.38] Yeah.
[280.58 → 288.30] And yeah, they're going to be making a few more points on the back end, but the tech industry is really, really tight.
[288.96 → 292.26] Speakers and headphones are another example of categories where there's margin.
[292.26 → 297.32] Yeah, I think it's like, if AirPods alone were split off, they're bigger than like Nike or something.
[297.70 → 298.28] But like...
[298.28 → 298.54] Crazy.
[298.80 → 303.76] Like, why do you think that your manager was pushing you so hard to attach a printer?
[304.20 → 304.40] Yeah.
[305.48 → 305.70] Yeah.
[305.80 → 306.00] Right?
[306.08 → 307.56] Because there was margin in printers.
[307.84 → 309.68] Or insurance or software or whatever else.
[309.68 → 309.80] Or something.
[310.10 → 310.84] A bag.
[311.16 → 316.08] You could go, and you could tell your super, I sold a hundred computer systems today.
[316.16 → 317.82] They'd be like, get the f*** out.
[318.46 → 318.74] You know?
[319.22 → 320.12] They don't care.
[320.22 → 320.90] Did you move attachments?
[320.90 → 321.86] Did you move other things?
[321.86 → 322.00] Exactly.
[322.18 → 322.58] Exactly.
[323.36 → 327.24] And it's not just framework on the laptop side.
[327.64 → 333.64] Racer has taken down pricing and pre-order pages for their new blades.
[334.22 → 341.08] HP, Dell, and Lenovo have suspended shipments of notebooks and related products to the US for at least two weeks.
[341.08 → 346.00] Nintendo, we talked about this last week, suspended pre-orders of the Switch 2 in the US.
[346.00 → 347.68] I think it was since then, though.
[347.94 → 353.64] They have also, thanks a lot, suspended pre-orders of the Switch 2 in Canada.
[353.64 → 357.56] This is from, actually, I'm not sure who prepped this topic.
[357.56 → 360.36] I feel like I've been spared in this situation.
[361.10 → 363.38] Oh, yeah, because you weren't going to buy one at launch anyway.
[363.74 → 365.66] You're going to wait until Willow Video has them.
[365.76 → 367.42] Which, Lord only knows when that will happen now.
[367.42 → 370.22] Which, this might actually help in a weird turn of events.
[370.30 → 371.98] This might help places like Willow.
[372.70 → 373.82] No, that could be true.
[373.88 → 375.02] Weird turn of events, but it might.
[375.02 → 382.76] Apparently, it is speculated, or I don't know if this is for sure, but apparently, packaging for US and Canada happens near Seattle.
[383.00 → 389.60] So, that could explain, if they're going into Seattle before they come up to Canada, then that would explain why Canada would be impacted.
[389.80 → 390.00] Yep.
[390.52 → 400.94] Approximately a third of Switch 2 production is happening in Vietnam, and Nintendo has started routing most of those consoles to the US to hopefully avoid the worst of the tariffs.
[400.94 → 413.16] multiple automakers have also suspended shipments or orders to the US, and China, whose tariff on imports of US goods is now 125%, so going the other way,
[413.56 → 422.28] says that there is no point in raising their tariffs further because there is no longer any market acceptance for US goods exported to China.
[422.28 → 436.90] However, it is always worth noting that any statement from a Chinese official should probably be taken with a similar amount of salt to how salty Luke was before the show that I won SWAN late today.
[436.90 → 437.42] Completely unfairly.
[437.76 → 440.90] He won SWAN late today while being late.
[441.54 → 442.28] Well, at least...
[442.28 → 443.76] It genuinely makes no sense.
[443.90 → 444.18] At least...
[444.18 → 448.52] It is not fair to have a contest where the decider of the contest is on your payroll.
[448.52 → 452.86] I think that it is not fair to park your car in a handicapped parking stall.
[453.40 → 455.42] You seem perfectly able-bodied to me.
[455.60 → 459.08] I actually just was going so fast I didn't see the sign at all.
[460.20 → 461.28] Which is a separate problem.
[461.30 → 462.22] But you were still late!
[462.66 → 463.54] You were still late.
[464.08 → 465.66] I'm fine not winning.
[466.60 → 467.92] You should also lose.
[468.48 → 470.36] It is not about my victory.
[470.46 → 471.46] It is about your loss.
[471.46 → 481.28] The China Semiconductor Industry Association published an urgent update today clarifying how the country of origin of semiconductor products is determined.
[481.74 → 490.40] For both packaged and unpackaged semiconductor products, the location where the wafer was processed is deemed to be the country of origin.
[490.40 → 495.40] And because China deems Taiwan to be part of its territory...
[496.26 → 499.50] Oh, okay, okay, hold on.
[499.62 → 507.98] That means that chips fabricated by TSMC, Micron, and other Taiwanese chipmakers will be exempt from the 125% duty imposed on U.S. products.
[508.04 → 512.92] Okay, I thought this was working against them when I first read it, but actually they're using the technicality of,
[512.92 → 519.88] Oh yeah, Taiwan is definitely us to justify not having to pay tariffs on TSMC fabricated goods.
[520.40 → 521.02] Sure, China.
[521.66 → 523.92] I mean, that's really smart.
[524.54 → 525.22] I guess.
[525.24 → 528.18] And the U.S. ta riffing Taiwan is like incredibly stupid.
[528.26 → 531.62] By that logic, actually, I mean, shouldn't the U.S. basically say,
[531.78 → 536.78] Well, since Canada is our 51st state anyway, there's no point in ta riffing anything from Canada.
[536.90 → 537.70] No, but the whole goal...
[537.70 → 540.46] Because neither of them have annexed either of those countries yet, so...
[540.46 → 541.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[541.42 → 542.02] I'm just...
[542.02 → 548.32] America's whole goal is continuing Canada's economic ruin so that they can try to, like, financially take us over.
[548.32 → 551.90] They do understand that Canadians are, like, not gonna, like, do that, right?
[552.16 → 552.40] Yeah.
[552.52 → 557.42] We're not just going to be like, oh yeah, economic victory, civ, whatever, like, I...
[557.42 → 561.54] I wonder, I wonder, you know...
[561.54 → 564.02] Okay, hmm, I don't even know if I want to go into this.
[564.60 → 565.32] No, I'll bring it up.
[566.64 → 568.10] You know how Civ 7...
[568.10 → 570.56] I don't know if you've heard any news about Civ 7, but do you know how Civ 7...
[570.56 → 573.40] I heard it kind of flopped, and then the first update was supposed to make it a lot better.
[573.46 → 573.96] That's all I know.
[574.02 → 576.50] This is how Civ works every single time, to be fair.
[576.72 → 579.34] This time, I'll throw this out there, I don't know if it's fixable.
[579.46 → 582.38] There are core things about the game that I actually just really don't like.
[582.52 → 582.70] Right.
[582.76 → 584.08] And I don't think they can fix.
[584.22 → 585.16] But, one of the things that they were...
[585.16 → 586.10] Like the Aztecs.
[586.76 → 587.58] F*** the Aztecs.
[587.60 → 589.22] One of the problems is you couldn't stay them.
[589.38 → 589.52] What?
[589.52 → 590.06] If you chose them.
[590.34 → 590.46] You're...
[590.46 → 591.16] You're...
[591.16 → 592.28] No!
[592.72 → 593.82] So if you start as...
[593.82 → 593.84] Every era.
[593.84 → 596.50] So if you're like Persians, then you just like become...
[596.50 → 597.44] Every era it changes.
[597.66 → 598.70] Wherever Persia became...
[598.70 → 599.02] Oh, crap.
[599.02 → 599.82] But it could become...
[599.82 → 600.58] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[601.60 → 602.04] Iran?
[602.46 → 603.02] I think so.
[603.22 → 603.42] Okay.
[604.16 → 605.18] Or if like...
[605.18 → 609.04] So you'll be the Ottomans at some point, or you'll be the Greeks and you just turn into
[609.04 → 609.90] Romans or whatever.
[610.00 → 610.48] It changes.
[610.54 → 611.16] Because you just get like...
[611.16 → 613.34] And any leader can lead any civilization.
[613.64 → 615.56] So you could be like Caesar...
[615.56 → 617.72] So you could be Gandhi leading like...
[617.72 → 618.06] America.
[618.24 → 619.86] The Australians or whatever.
[620.04 → 620.16] Sure.
[621.22 → 621.54] I...
[621.54 → 623.08] I personally do not like it.
[623.80 → 624.64] I don't like it.
[624.70 → 625.34] But anyway...
[625.34 → 626.48] No, you should get...
[626.48 → 629.28] No, you should get to be like freaking...
[629.28 → 631.50] I like one leader, one Civ the whole way through.
[631.56 → 632.62] It's been that way the whole time.
[632.70 → 634.12] I understand they're trying to change things up.
[634.20 → 635.92] Civ has been very similar for many years.
[636.06 → 636.30] I...
[636.30 → 637.82] I understand the desire.
[638.70 → 641.36] Yeah, already saying the more I play Civ 7, the less I like it.
[641.56 → 642.20] And that was...
[642.20 → 645.54] I only played one full campaign, and that was true for me the whole way through the
[645.54 → 645.84] campaign.
[646.06 → 648.06] I liked it less and less and less and less and less the whole time.
[648.16 → 649.02] So tell me that...
[649.02 → 649.46] Actually...
[649.46 → 650.40] Wait, did I even...
[650.40 → 651.14] I don't think I finished it.
[651.14 → 653.76] You say Civ's been really similar for a long time.
[653.96 → 658.24] That's funny you bring that up because we actually shot a video earlier this week of
[658.24 → 662.44] younger people reacting to the games that were formative for me.
[662.80 → 664.34] And one of the games...
[664.34 → 668.54] And I kind of picked not just games that I played a lot or enjoyed a lot, but ones that
[668.54 → 670.38] marked significant milestones for me.
[670.66 → 673.20] So I had the first one that I ever upgraded my computer for.
[673.46 → 673.62] Nice.
[673.62 → 676.10] I had the first one I ever bought a special peripheral to play.
[676.22 → 676.46] Cool.
[676.58 → 683.02] I had the first one I ever bought a tower upgrade for, and it was Civilization 2 Test
[683.02 → 683.38] of Time.
[683.68 → 686.90] And the reason was that the emissaries were 3D rendered.
[687.40 → 687.62] Yeah.
[687.72 → 690.44] So until then, I only ever had software rendering.
[690.54 → 692.54] I only ever played games that required software rendering.
[692.60 → 695.96] All of a sudden, I needed a DirectX 6 or something like...
[695.96 → 701.26] A DirectX accelerator and at least 8 megabytes of VRAM or whatever the requirements were.
[701.26 → 701.82] 16 legs?
[701.88 → 702.50] Something like that.
[703.02 → 705.92] And I don't think...
[705.92 → 707.00] Spoiler for the video.
[707.40 → 712.98] I don't think that Civ 2 got a fair shake because they only had like a few minutes to
[712.98 → 713.66] try each game.
[713.72 → 717.98] We weren't going to give them like 6 hours to familiarize themselves with Civilization
[717.98 → 718.24] 2.
[718.24 → 723.80] But I do wonder if you as a Civ veteran could go back and play something like Civ 2 and
[723.80 → 725.02] legitimately enjoy it still.
[725.28 → 725.72] Okay.
[725.88 → 726.58] I think yes.
[726.84 → 727.56] Because...
[727.56 → 729.62] And my reason for this was a long time ago.
[729.66 → 733.76] I don't know if you remember this, but I did a stream for one of my birthdays where
[733.76 → 734.50] it was a charity stream.
[734.64 → 738.74] And I played one game for an hour for every year that I had been alive.
[738.94 → 739.68] So I played one...
[739.68 → 740.68] I remember that, actually.
[740.68 → 744.20] I played one game for an hour that was released in 1990.
[744.38 → 746.58] And then I played one game for an hour that was released in 1991.
[746.80 → 747.96] I went all the way through to current year.
[748.08 → 750.26] And in that, I played Civ 1.
[750.88 → 754.52] And in the hour, I took over all of Europe and Asia.
[755.82 → 758.88] And I hadn't touched that game since I was like a wee lad.
[759.20 → 759.80] That's pretty cool.
[759.86 → 761.94] So I think I could still figure it out.
[762.46 → 763.72] Would you enjoy it though?
[763.92 → 764.36] I enjoyed Civ 1.
[764.36 → 765.52] That was actually my question.
[765.62 → 765.86] I enjoyed Civ 1.
[765.86 → 766.72] Did you ever play Civ 2?
[767.34 → 768.62] Because I never played Civ 1.
[768.62 → 773.54] I'm fairly certain I did, but I haven't since it would have been like the current Civ.
[773.64 → 774.34] So it's been a long time.
[774.44 → 779.48] I tried to go back and play Civilization 1, having played Civ 2 as my first Civ.
[779.60 → 785.00] And I found it to just be utterly lacking in depth, creature comforts that I needed.
[785.02 → 786.02] You just have to fight all the time.
[786.12 → 791.16] Civ 2 felt like going from Warcraft 1 to Warcraft 2.
[791.46 → 794.74] Like it was just a better game in every possible way.
[794.74 → 797.84] I never actually got into another one though.
[797.84 → 801.28] And I know some of the other ones are really, really great.
[802.50 → 805.32] But I just, I became an Anna boy.
[806.02 → 809.86] Or more realistically Warcraft 3 after that.
[810.04 → 810.76] Anna's fantastic.
[811.22 → 814.74] Artie and I are extremely agreed on this.
[814.94 → 816.54] Civ 5 was the best one.
[816.94 → 820.44] Civ 6, I do think, aged very well.
[820.74 → 821.32] It got better.
[821.56 → 822.88] The expansions are perfect.
[823.26 → 824.08] That type of stuff.
[824.08 → 825.80] But I still think Civ 5 was kind of peak.
[825.90 → 830.26] But anyway, Civ 6, I will give it as much as I didn't like it as much as Civ 5.
[830.42 → 831.96] It had a fantastic UI.
[832.48 → 834.08] The UI UX of Civ 6 was clean.
[835.04 → 835.64] It felt good.
[835.68 → 836.62] It was a good experience.
[838.52 → 842.02] Civ 7, there was a huge problem because the UI was terrible.
[842.02 → 849.46] You know who pushed over 300 bug fixes for Civ 6?
[850.20 → 852.30] Again, Civ 6's UI was fantastic.
[852.42 → 854.98] You know who pushed over 300 bug fixes for Civ 6?
[857.10 → 857.58] Him?
[860.30 → 861.36] Luigi Mangione.
[861.36 → 866.12] What?
[868.28 → 869.92] The guy who assassinated the guy?
[869.92 → 870.64] I'm not kidding.
[872.88 → 873.28] Yeah.
[873.92 → 874.92] Most based.
[876.16 → 879.58] He was perfect at Civ UI.
[880.84 → 881.90] It was very good.
[882.18 → 883.18] It's probably the best.
[883.20 → 884.14] I love Civ 5.
[884.28 → 886.58] Civ 6's UI was probably the best one they ever pushed.
[886.62 → 888.58] Sorry, he worked for them at that time?
[888.66 → 888.84] Yeah.
[888.84 → 889.50] Oh, okay.
[889.58 → 892.20] I thought you meant like he was a super player and he...
[892.20 → 892.36] No, I don't think so.
[892.36 → 894.24] You mean like actually pushed bug fixes?
[894.46 → 894.60] Yeah.
[894.60 → 895.64] Like actually committed?
[895.66 → 896.26] Over 300, yeah.
[896.36 → 897.86] Okay, I thought you meant like reported.
[898.14 → 899.64] So no, he is actually like...
[899.64 → 900.20] He fixed them.
[900.86 → 901.12] Huh.
[901.24 → 901.84] He made it good.
[901.96 → 902.66] He made it perfect.
[903.14 → 904.84] So you're saying that...
[905.66 → 906.10] He did...
[906.10 → 909.26] You appreciate the work of Luigi Mangione.
[910.10 → 910.38] Yeah.
[911.50 → 913.28] He did great stuff for Civ.
[913.80 → 914.86] Civ 6 was fantastic.
[914.86 → 916.86] And by Civ, you mean...
[916.86 → 918.22] Civilization.
[918.46 → 918.82] Civilization.
[918.84 → 919.30] At large.
[919.32 → 920.68] But like...
[920.68 → 922.28] He did perfect things for Civ.
[922.28 → 923.24] Video game or...
[923.24 → 924.84] Civilization or...
[924.84 → 925.24] You know what?
[925.30 → 928.76] His improvements to the civilization was perfect.
[928.86 → 929.62] Elijah's in chat.
[929.78 → 930.88] Fix your wording!
[933.76 → 935.30] He allegedly did it right.
[935.42 → 935.70] Right, right.
[935.74 → 936.26] Allegedly.
[936.58 → 938.30] How did we get on this topic again?
[938.66 → 944.38] China does not rule out other forms of retaliation against the US, announcing that they are reducing
[944.38 → 952.08] the number of Hollywood films permitted to release and restricting import and export rights for a number of US companies.
[952.08 → 958.22] Our discussion question here is moved directly to next topic.
[958.22 → 958.94] Do not pass.
[959.00 → 959.16] Go.
[959.28 → 960.38] Do not collect $200.
[960.38 → 974.52] As a technically partial owner of Framework, how do you feel about the impact on Framework's business and Framework's future based on this?
[974.52 → 979.96] I know that you said the only thing that would cause you to pull out was a change in their like...
[979.96 → 980.58] I don't know what I would call it.
[980.58 → 980.70] Principles.
[980.70 → 981.94] Ideology principles, sure.
[982.04 → 982.14] Yeah.
[982.14 → 984.02] This doesn't feel like that.
[984.04 → 984.44] Oh, no.
[984.62 → 985.06] At all.
[985.16 → 985.68] Oh, yeah, no.
[985.80 → 991.24] But how do you feel as a partial owner about the decision, the direction, their margin?
[992.22 → 996.34] I got to be honest with you, and I'm sorry, Iraq.
[996.68 → 1000.96] I am way more concerned about my own margin and my own store right now.
[1001.52 → 1007.90] Like, Framework is cool, and literally every person that I've met there, like...
[1007.90 → 1008.42] Seems legit.
[1008.42 → 1011.56] From CEO down, seems like awesome.
[1011.56 → 1013.26] Like, legitimately awesome.
[1014.96 → 1030.52] I was super impressed the first time that I met, like, a broader group of the team there, because literally everyone I spoke to just, like, so quick, so focused on what they're doing.
[1030.60 → 1032.32] Like, they just seem like a super focused company.
[1032.60 → 1035.60] They have a great culture, as far as I can tell, from basically the outside.
[1036.58 → 1037.66] But they aren't my company.
[1038.26 → 1038.66] Yeah.
[1038.88 → 1040.60] And I'm rooting for their mission.
[1040.60 → 1042.38] I'm super excited about their mission.
[1043.60 → 1047.88] But I think that, you know, they have already opened a lot of eyes, and there's a lot of momentum.
[1048.06 → 1053.36] So in terms of my goal of what I was trying to achieve with the investment, I think I've gotten a lot out of it already.
[1053.56 → 1055.52] I don't think this is going to kill them either.
[1055.74 → 1055.90] No.
[1055.90 → 1058.70] Like, I think this is a storm.
[1059.26 → 1061.18] It's a little storm, and I think they're going to weather it.
[1061.18 → 1063.50] It kind of helps that this is a storm that everyone's going through.
[1063.74 → 1064.02] Yeah.
[1064.58 → 1064.94] Yeah.
[1065.46 → 1070.70] And realistically, you know, it's not that I don't empathize.
[1070.70 → 1072.68] I 100% empathize.
[1072.84 → 1076.92] But I've got to focus on keeping my ship upright right now.
[1077.72 → 1084.26] This might be, you know, I think it would be very reasonable for someone to say that this is really stupid for me to bring up.
[1084.80 → 1085.28] Okay.
[1085.28 → 1087.54] This is really stupid of you to bring up.
[1087.68 → 1087.86] Nice.
[1087.96 → 1088.12] Cool.
[1088.86 → 1094.64] I think it's interesting that software is dodging all of this.
[1097.22 → 1098.18] Software is?
[1098.30 → 1098.50] Oh.
[1098.50 → 1103.10] Because I'm wondering when that is going to flip.
[1103.56 → 1103.66] Right.
[1103.66 → 1107.98] Because a lot of America's exports is software.
[1109.00 → 1109.44] Right.
[1110.32 → 1112.14] And nobody's doing that right now.
[1112.86 → 1113.28] Interesting.
[1113.46 → 1113.56] Yeah.
[1113.58 → 1114.48] It's only physical goods.
[1114.58 → 1119.00] If you want to hurt them, don't make that many physical goods that they export out.
[1119.10 → 1121.20] That's why they have all these trade deficits with these countries.
[1121.22 → 1121.48] Yeah.
[1121.50 → 1122.86] I probably just wouldn't have brought it up.
[1123.56 → 1124.34] I don't know, dude.
[1125.14 → 1126.88] But it's just fascinating.
[1126.88 → 1128.46] Now EU is on that.
[1128.58 → 1128.74] Okay.
[1128.84 → 1129.86] So somebody's working on it.
[1129.86 → 1130.44] Oh, EU's on it.
[1130.50 → 1130.72] Okay.
[1130.76 → 1132.28] So like that's going to become part of the equation.
[1132.46 → 1133.78] And then Float plane is.
[1134.16 → 1137.90] Avon Fox says, yeah, the US has a huge surplus in entertainment media as well.
[1137.98 → 1139.44] So China's already on that.
[1139.84 → 1140.48] Allowing fewer.
[1140.58 → 1142.36] I mean, fewer films in China.
[1142.36 → 1143.76] They were already super restrictive.
[1143.76 → 1146.52] Not to mention being super restrictive in terms of the content.
[1146.66 → 1150.98] I mean, when was the last time that we had like, oh man, what are there?
[1151.16 → 1154.16] When was the last time we had a triad as a bad guy in a Hollywood film?
[1155.60 → 1156.52] It's been a hot minute.
[1156.52 → 1156.96] Yeah.
[1157.14 → 1157.44] Yeah.
[1157.74 → 1158.34] A little bit.
[1158.40 → 1160.00] I feel like it's like 90s, 80s.
[1160.04 → 1164.60] Because basically if you have like any Chinese funding, from what I understand, if you have
[1164.60 → 1169.86] like any Chinese funding in your film, which they have invested extremely heavily in, you
[1169.86 → 1176.62] pretty much have to follow China's censorship rules in America, which is, yeah.
[1177.38 → 1180.62] But that's like control of the import.
[1180.72 → 1181.62] That's not even a tariff.
[1181.62 → 1187.38] But yeah, I mean, they already block so much US media anyway.
[1187.64 → 1191.64] The digital landscape is going to get really weird if that happens because we've never
[1191.64 → 1193.08] had to deal with this anywhere.
[1193.44 → 1195.50] It's been full free market forever.
[1196.94 → 1198.00] I mean, no.
[1198.72 → 1199.00] There are.
[1199.00 → 1200.30] As far as tariffs are concerned.
[1200.56 → 1203.42] A lot of tariffs in the world as it is.
[1203.50 → 1204.90] No, for digital stuff.
[1205.04 → 1205.58] Oh, digital.
[1205.72 → 1205.92] Yeah.
[1205.92 → 1206.28] Yeah.
[1206.54 → 1206.58] Yeah.
[1206.58 → 1207.84] No, that's a fair point.
[1208.58 → 1212.38] Back to making sure that our own ship is doing okay.
[1212.56 → 1212.72] Yeah.
[1212.72 → 1216.18] We've got a pretty exciting sale event going on right now.
[1216.36 → 1216.82] Love the graphic.
[1217.04 → 1219.82] I'm going to get real inside baseball for you guys here.
[1219.82 → 1228.62] Basically, we have a lot of inventory that we had big plans for Lime Day.
[1229.10 → 1230.74] So like upcoming promos.
[1231.10 → 1235.56] Big plans for just, you know, having in stock so that we have things in stock on our store.
[1236.56 → 1241.38] As we said last week, we're putting in place every mitigation that we can to shield our customers
[1241.38 → 1244.70] from as many price increases as we can.
[1244.70 → 1252.62] But with that said, there will be some price increases in areas where we simply cannot absorb
[1252.62 → 1255.26] any potential tariffs in our costs.
[1255.26 → 1262.38] We don't know exactly what all of those costs will be because the whole situation is extremely
[1262.38 → 1263.26] fluid.
[1263.26 → 1271.48] So what we're doing right now is before May the 2nd, when theoretically, if everything
[1271.48 → 1278.82] goes into if everything goes according to what has currently been communicated, costs
[1278.82 → 1285.06] for especially our U.S. customers are going to go way up on our items is we are launching
[1285.06 → 1287.10] our Shitstorm sale.
[1287.58 → 1289.30] We are doing free shipping.
[1289.30 → 1291.24] And this is not just for America.
[1291.24 → 1291.70] Okay.
[1291.70 → 1298.16] Free shipping on all orders worldwide over $150 on LTT store.
[1298.38 → 1301.78] This is a pretty high-cost promo for us guys.
[1301.94 → 1309.10] So click that shop now, and please make sure to add at least one thing other than the MCM
[1309.10 → 1310.48] essential solution bundle.
[1310.62 → 1312.74] This is the lowest price we've ever done on this.
[1312.82 → 1316.22] This is our headline deal to kick off this sale event.
[1316.22 → 1319.50] It's $80 for this.
[1319.50 → 1322.68] This is a really, really nice magnetic cable management kit.
[1322.68 → 1324.16] So you can do a power bar.
[1324.24 → 1328.00] You can do a couple power bricks, bunch of zip ties, lots of cables.
[1328.08 → 1329.54] We've even got one of the big boys in there.
[1329.74 → 1331.48] Lots of metal plates for mounting them.
[1331.98 → 1332.70] Cable ties.
[1332.70 → 1337.44] Basically everything you need to do to make your setup look like this.
[1338.76 → 1340.22] Absolutely gorgeous.
[1340.70 → 1343.12] And yeah, you know, while you're at it, grab a commuter backpack.
[1343.44 → 1343.60] All right.
[1343.64 → 1346.08] Grab a precision multi-bit screwdriver and bit set.
[1346.94 → 1348.86] Grab a screwdriver, stubby screwdriver.
[1349.40 → 1350.56] Just, oh, scribe driver.
[1350.72 → 1352.12] Great time to pick up a scribe driver.
[1352.68 → 1354.82] So throw together a cart, 150 bucks.
[1355.74 → 1356.56] Free shipping.
[1357.16 → 1362.18] Shout out, Conrad, for this awesome little animation at the top.
[1362.20 → 1363.92] Yeah, the bar thing is really nice, actually.
[1363.92 → 1365.36] Shows you how much you got to fill up your bar.
[1365.94 → 1366.58] That's sweet.
[1366.68 → 1367.54] Things are going to be tight.
[1367.84 → 1373.32] I don't know what kind of promos we're going to be able to afford to do over the next little bit.
[1373.32 → 1375.80] So now's a great time to get an order in.
[1376.10 → 1379.38] We're going to get everything shipped out before the second.
[1379.98 → 1380.58] And who knows?
[1380.68 → 1381.82] Maybe none of the tariffs will happen.
[1381.82 → 1382.72] And I don't know.
[1383.10 → 1384.16] I don't know what's happening.
[1384.42 → 1390.00] But I do know that we want to get out ahead of it and, you know, get you guys hooked up.
[1390.78 → 1393.56] Garrett H says, make LTT store Canadian dollars.
[1393.80 → 1398.42] We will be launching a Canadian dollar store at some point in the near future.
[1399.08 → 1400.18] More work than you'd expect.
[1400.32 → 1402.30] Don't expect, like, one-to-one pricing.
[1402.30 → 1406.66] If something was $99 US dollars on the US store, it's not going to be $99 Canadian dollars.
[1406.74 → 1408.12] That is, like, literally not how it works.
[1408.72 → 1410.86] But we will have a Canadian pricing store.
[1410.86 → 1416.38] We are working on all kinds of mitigations as much as we can, as fast as we can.
[1417.42 → 1418.68] We're doing our best, guys.
[1418.92 → 1420.04] Our dollar is getting better.
[1421.04 → 1421.56] Yeah.
[1422.26 → 1423.32] That is...
[1423.32 → 1424.90] Oh, my God.
[1425.00 → 1426.34] Another basis point today?
[1426.52 → 1426.78] Yeah.
[1428.00 → 1432.08] I don't remember the last time it moved this fast.
[1432.22 → 1436.82] Actually, I do remember the last time it moved this fast because it was the 2008 financial crisis.
[1436.82 → 1439.78] And I was working in product management at NCI.
[1439.78 → 1439.92] Yeah.
[1439.92 → 1441.20] So I remember exactly...
[1441.20 → 1449.24] Dude, we used to place orders for product and literally have no idea what our retail price was going to be.
[1449.24 → 1454.20] Because back to our conversation earlier about extremely thin margins in the computer industry.
[1454.20 → 1454.46] Yeah.
[1454.46 → 1470.36] For commodities like hard drives, it was a regular occurrence for NCI to be making maybe 2% to 3% by the time you factored in credit card or any other processing fees, any labour or salespeople commissions associated with selling the product.
[1470.36 → 1473.12] Like, we were selling them at 6, 7 points gross.
[1474.42 → 1479.94] But you have costs associated with bringing these things in, putting labels on them, stacking them on shelves.
[1480.02 → 1481.16] Like, there are costs, right?
[1481.52 → 1485.76] And so, functionally speaking, we basically didn't make a profit on them.
[1486.02 → 1495.60] So if you had a 2%, 3% shift in Forex in between when you placed the order and when you got it, you could literally put your price on the site based on your order.
[1496.10 → 1498.66] And then by the time you actually get it and ship it, you're losing money.
[1498.66 → 1502.28] And making matters even worse, so much of our product was on net terms.
[1502.82 → 1505.68] So it wasn't just the delay from shipment to receiving.
[1505.92 → 1515.32] It was actually the delay sometimes from when we placed the order to 30 days after we received the order when we would finally know how much we were paying for the product.
[1515.40 → 1523.66] So you could bring in a pallet of GPUs, sell them for some price that you thought was profitable by 5%, and then it turns out you actually sold them for a 1% loss.
[1523.76 → 1524.12] Gross.
[1524.44 → 1526.22] Because the currency was all over the place.
[1526.36 → 1526.66] Gross.
[1526.66 → 1528.50] It was madness.
[1529.56 → 1530.82] Dude, it was madness.
[1531.34 → 1533.74] And when it swung the other way, obviously you were happy.
[1534.20 → 1536.14] But, I mean, we would pull moves all the time.
[1536.28 → 1537.92] We would try to hedge, right?
[1538.00 → 1543.08] We'd try to be like, hey, Kim, oh, sorry, I didn't see your bill.
[1543.60 → 1544.60] We'll get to it right away.
[1544.66 → 1548.94] And we'd try to push things off a week, hoping that the currency would recover a little bit.
[1549.00 → 1550.22] To be clear, I didn't do that.
[1550.28 → 1551.30] I was not involved in that.
[1551.34 → 1554.14] But I heard through the grapevine, because I'd go to place another order.
[1554.14 → 1555.62] I'd be like, yeah, can I get another order?
[1555.68 → 1556.24] And they're like, no.
[1556.58 → 1561.16] I remember you kind of like raging about this back when we worked there.
[1561.70 → 1562.36] That was a separate issue.
[1562.42 → 1563.48] That was when they were running out of money.
[1564.10 → 1572.14] This was when we had money, but we just were deciding not to spend it on the things that we had already gotten into our warehouse and sold to customers.
[1572.22 → 1572.76] It was a whole thing.
[1573.12 → 1573.58] Got it.
[1573.58 → 1575.00] Oh, man.
[1576.12 → 1576.60] Yeah.
[1578.00 → 1582.32] Anyway, is there a topic that isn't about the economy?
[1582.94 → 1583.46] No, no.
[1583.52 → 1587.08] We're moving right into our next topic, which is more of a discussion.
[1587.90 → 1598.14] There's been a lot of conversation this week about moving electronics manufacturing back to the U.S., whether that's possible, and if it is, what that would look like.
[1598.14 → 1605.70] One phone company, Purism, says that their $800 phone will become $2,000 when made locally.
[1606.50 → 1613.82] In general, this is not related to Purism directly, materials would need to be sourced and imported or mined and refined at home.
[1614.16 → 1621.76] For instance, titanium, not found in America, and lithium, lots found in America, but only one active mine.
[1622.00 → 1626.78] And that's a fascinating part of the conversation that I think some folks are overlooking.
[1626.78 → 1629.30] The time delay of getting more mines up and stuff?
[1629.30 → 1629.96] Well, not just that.
[1630.08 → 1630.90] Sorry, yes, that.
[1631.02 → 1645.00] But also, an element of this that, pun intended, that I think is fascinating is the number of people that look at the cost breakdown of something like an iPhone or a Purism phone or whatever it is, and they go,
[1645.00 → 1656.14] okay, well, the labour cost for it was X in Mexico or in China or Vietnam or whatever, and it's X times whatever multiplier in America.
[1657.02 → 1668.24] So, realistically, and we've seen this argument where I think it was McDonald's or someone was complaining that if they increased the minimum wage by some amount, that it would dramatically increase their prices, but it turned out it didn't.
[1668.24 → 1670.28] Well, yeah, because of the whole Denmark thing, but anyway.
[1670.34 → 1671.22] But here's the thing.
[1671.48 → 1672.40] Here's the thing, right?
[1672.64 → 1681.82] Because at the end of the day, everything, not just the assembly, everything is impacted, is ultimately labour, right?
[1682.18 → 1685.64] A hunk of lithium, the price you pay for it, well...
[1685.64 → 1686.40] It's going to come from somewhere.
[1686.64 → 1688.68] You didn't pay the ground you took it out of.
[1688.70 → 1688.84] Yeah.
[1689.12 → 1691.12] You paid the people who extracted it.
[1691.12 → 1693.94] So, if you actually were to...
[1693.94 → 1711.00] So, these comparisons people are making are actually really apples to oranges because they're looking at the sourcing of these raw materials that are being done by people who are being paid far less than Western wages, regardless of whether they're ethically sourced or whatever.
[1711.20 → 1712.94] It's still going to be a lot less than a Western wage.
[1713.42 → 1716.36] So, the calculations, and Purism may be doing the math, right?
[1716.36 → 1721.14] I'm actually not sure, but I see comparisons that people are making that are like, oh, this won't be that big of a deal.
[1721.22 → 1723.64] Remember when McDonald's complained that the labour costs going up?
[1723.80 → 1731.00] Well, that's because all their raw materials being produced by, you know, Western labour costs or whatever, that was already factored in.
[1731.68 → 1733.00] Whereas here, they're not.
[1734.64 → 1741.50] Now, most rare earth metals are mined in America, but supply of these may not be enough to meet demand, at least not immediately.
[1741.50 → 1744.18] So, new manufacturing sites would need to be built.
[1744.18 → 1750.64] A lot is manufactured in America already, but some companies have overseas manufacturing to supplement demand.
[1750.74 → 1759.34] For example, New Haven Display manufactures custom OLED screens in Illinois, but they also have manufacturing over in China.
[1760.72 → 1764.26] Actually, sorry, I'm going to totally go off in a different direction for a second.
[1764.30 → 1765.66] Do you see Mr. Beast comment about it?
[1765.66 → 1776.06] Oh, yeah, he was pretty upset because he was saying his Feast ables bars are manufactured in the U.S., but the materials are coming from...
[1776.62 → 1777.42] He apparently...
[1777.42 → 1779.32] And look, this is all just based on his tweet.
[1779.34 → 1781.04] Yeah, how much like cocoa comes from the States?
[1781.42 → 1786.88] He says he's working really hard to get like ethically sourced cocoa or whatever, but it's not from America.
[1786.88 → 1791.80] So, if he gets ta riffed on those imports, all of a sudden the whole business model makes no sense.
[1791.86 → 1793.64] And he's like, well, that could impact American jobs.
[1793.74 → 1795.14] Did anyone kind of...
[1795.14 → 1796.66] Did anyone do that math?
[1796.78 → 1797.32] Probably not.
[1798.14 → 1799.28] There's a lot of stuff like that.
[1799.36 → 1808.40] Like there's mattress companies, and they have to get like Dunlop latex.
[1808.92 → 1811.16] Like I don't think any of that exists in the States.
[1811.16 → 1812.90] I could be wrong, but I don't think any of it does.
[1814.90 → 1818.40] But I believe they manufacture the mattresses up here.
[1818.46 → 1820.10] I don't know what specific brand.
[1820.80 → 1828.98] But there's like interesting component stuff where it's like, yeah, not everything grows or exists in specifically the United States.
[1830.06 → 1832.08] New supply lines will need to be implemented.
[1832.46 → 1838.62] Some manufacturing projects take so many resources and people and time that they essentially create small towns.
[1839.04 → 1840.44] I actually had never heard of this.
[1840.44 → 1844.02] One of Apple's biggest final assembly test and pack out centres is in...
[1844.02 → 1844.84] And I'm going to butcher this.
[1844.90 → 1845.16] I'm sorry.
[1845.78 → 1846.58] Zhengzhou?
[1847.18 → 1848.50] Anyway, it's apparently called iPhone.
[1848.62 → 1850.80] It's kind of referred to as iPhone City.
[1851.56 → 1855.38] And the doc points out millions are employed in China by Apple alone.
[1855.88 → 1861.24] New truck and train routes will need to be figured out since materials and goods will have to move from one location to another still.
[1861.76 → 1864.18] This is going to take some time.
[1864.18 → 1869.16] And this may be a hot take depending on the audience that I'm talking to.
[1869.32 → 1874.52] But overall, I totally get what the U.S. is doing.
[1875.86 → 1888.46] It is actually a terrible, terrible plan to have critical supplies completely owned, operated, and controlled by a country that you are essentially locked in a Cold War with.
[1888.64 → 1889.14] Adversarial with.
[1889.14 → 1889.34] Yeah.
[1889.54 → 1889.90] Yeah.
[1890.48 → 1891.38] I get it.
[1892.02 → 1894.00] I don't think there's a way to go about solving it.
[1894.70 → 1896.42] I'm not taking a position on that.
[1896.48 → 1897.02] But yeah, I get that for sure.
[1897.02 → 1898.50] That wouldn't be very Canadian of me.
[1898.58 → 1901.10] Yeah, especially if it's like planes, boats, stuff like that.
[1901.26 → 1902.10] A hundred percent.
[1902.28 → 1902.44] Yeah.
[1902.62 → 1903.40] And it's everything.
[1903.52 → 1903.72] It's microprocessors.
[1903.72 → 1904.94] It's AI.
[1905.44 → 1906.50] It's critical minerals.
[1906.78 → 1907.76] It's everything, right?
[1907.78 → 1910.48] There's like practically no ship manufacturing in the States anymore.
[1911.38 → 1915.26] It's like, yeah, that's knowing how America feels about their boats.
[1915.54 → 1916.98] So that's maybe not a good thing.
[1916.98 → 1931.10] So that's a fascinating dynamic in all of this for me is I'm looking at what they're trying to accomplish, which is, you know, some freaking independence, some self-sufficiency.
[1931.10 → 1946.88] I mean, they were independent a long time ago, but some self-sufficiency in a world where, let's be honest, China has been engaged in economic warfare for as long as I can remember in my adult life.
[1946.96 → 1947.28] Absolutely.
[1947.66 → 1955.26] I mean, look no further than what they're doing to attempt to destroy the automotive industry in literally every other developed nation.
[1955.28 → 1955.50] Oh, yeah.
[1955.52 → 1956.90] I mean, they do this in a ton of ways, too.
[1956.96 → 1958.32] It's not just the automotive industry.
[1958.32 → 1960.96] They do this in lots and lots of ways.
[1961.70 → 1966.84] So like waking up and finally playing ball totally makes sense to me.
[1966.92 → 1967.54] Totally makes sense.
[1967.56 → 1970.66] Again, I just don't necessarily think this is the way to do it.
[1970.90 → 1978.12] And cleaving, you know, every single other country that exists and some of your own, you know, military bases and stuff is maybe not the way to go about it.
[1978.26 → 1986.14] So here's the thing, though, is that if you, well, okay, no, I'm not going to try to explain why they did that.
[1986.14 → 1990.56] There are some potentially valid reasons why they cast such a wide net.
[1991.10 → 1993.28] In order to prevent pass through shipping.
[1993.62 → 1994.10] Yeah, yeah.
[1994.26 → 1995.14] Tariff avoidance.
[1995.44 → 1995.64] Whole thing.
[1995.80 → 1996.00] Yep.
[1996.00 → 2002.28] So, G Kun in float plane chat says, at Linus, any suggestions on how to do it better?
[2003.36 → 2007.00] And I think you basically nailed the curse that I live with.
[2007.00 → 2016.32] I am smart enough to recognize the situation for what it is, but I am not smart enough to solve it.
[2016.36 → 2018.24] Well, you're not like an economic...
[2018.24 → 2022.92] Shameless enough to pretend that I know how to solve it and to offer you easy answers.
[2022.92 → 2035.46] So I basically kind of sit here as helpless as anyone else while everything happens around me.
[2035.46 → 2050.76] I honestly, some days, envy the people who just don't really seem to understand some of the negative impacts of this and what they will potentially be.
[2050.76 → 2054.40] Because it seems like they seem happier.
[2057.84 → 2064.56] It's interesting up here, too, because there's some sentiment of like, oh, we can still get cheaper stuff, right?
[2064.60 → 2071.66] Like the switch is probably not going to be exceptionally expensive up here unless they just mirror the price, which happens sometimes.
[2071.66 → 2073.24] Which they could very well do.
[2073.26 → 2079.52] It's decently common that Canadian pricing is just, you know, dollar conversion to U.S. pricing.
[2079.68 → 2079.70] Yeah.
[2080.26 → 2083.46] But this is unprecedented in my lifetime.
[2083.66 → 2083.82] Yeah.
[2083.98 → 2086.28] So how everyone's going to handle it...
[2086.28 → 2086.68] We don't know.
[2086.86 → 2087.80] ...could be all over the map.
[2088.76 → 2089.98] I mean, you never know.
[2090.26 → 2097.00] Nintendo tomorrow could say, hey, you know, we actually have enough switches to start shipping these right now.
[2097.00 → 2102.72] We're going to keep them software locked until, you know, after the official launch date that we announced or whatever.
[2103.40 → 2111.48] But yeah, you know, we took a page out of LTT Stores book, and we were like, emergency sale.
[2111.58 → 2115.04] Everyone buy your switches now, and then we'll just leave them software locked until...
[2115.04 → 2116.44] They probably won't.
[2116.64 → 2118.58] There's no way Nintendo would do that.
[2119.20 → 2119.78] But they could.
[2120.88 → 2121.40] Conceivably.
[2121.84 → 2123.12] They could conceivably do that.
[2123.12 → 2126.88] I mean, they've been manufacturing Switch 2s for months now, if the rumours are anything to go by.
[2127.74 → 2135.34] By the way, I just want to remind you guys, now is the time to pick up some pre-tariff LTT Store merchandise.
[2135.88 → 2138.82] Free worldwide shipping on orders over $150.
[2139.14 → 2142.48] You're going to hear me talk about this a fair bit today because we need to move some inventory.
[2142.66 → 2143.52] Go, go, go.
[2143.72 → 2144.56] I thought it was kind of funny.
[2144.62 → 2145.80] I was reading something the other day.
[2146.02 → 2148.24] I forget a lot of the details because I was just skimming it.
[2148.24 → 2154.78] But Canada and Japan are in talks about like working together for market stability.
[2155.28 → 2157.62] And I was like, man, like two of the...
[2157.62 → 2159.74] It's cool.
[2159.88 → 2160.50] That's a good thing.
[2160.56 → 2161.38] We should probably do that.
[2161.52 → 2162.24] Kind of sucks.
[2162.30 → 2163.34] And it's like two of the worst.
[2164.54 → 2165.28] Like, what is it?
[2165.30 → 2167.48] G20, whatever economies right now.
[2167.48 → 2170.52] We're like, yeah, let's try to not be so bad together.
[2170.62 → 2171.60] It's like, oh, man.
[2171.76 → 2172.12] All right.
[2172.12 → 2174.82] Cool, man.
[2174.88 → 2176.12] Yeah, let's figure it out.
[2176.54 → 2178.70] Well, we've got our overpriced housing crisis.
[2179.06 → 2181.08] They have their worthless countryside.
[2181.18 → 2182.64] Can't give them away housing crisis.
[2183.40 → 2186.02] We've got our sort of...
[2186.02 → 2188.76] We had no idea what we were doing with immigration crisis.
[2189.04 → 2190.98] They've got their...
[2190.98 → 2192.76] Well, we don't have immigration crisis.
[2192.76 → 2195.32] We just entirely forgot that GDP...
[2195.32 → 2196.42] Our birth rate sucks, too.
[2196.60 → 2196.90] Oh, yeah.
[2196.94 → 2197.98] I don't know how we solve that one.
[2198.64 → 2202.10] We sort of just forgot that GDP per capita is supposed to go up.
[2202.34 → 2204.30] We just decided, like, nah, we'll just leave it where it is.
[2204.32 → 2205.58] No, we'll just brute force it with capita.
[2205.72 → 2206.16] Yeah, yeah.
[2206.22 → 2206.66] We'll just have more.
[2206.66 → 2207.88] All capita all day.
[2208.98 → 2214.52] Don't bother building more houses in spite of the fact that we're a global leader in supply of softwood lumber.
[2214.70 → 2215.04] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2215.04 → 2216.46] Let's not use any of it here.
[2216.52 → 2217.00] No, no, no.
[2217.10 → 2218.18] That all has to go away.
[2218.30 → 2219.22] That all has to go away.
[2219.76 → 2221.44] By default, it has to go away.
[2221.44 → 2222.02] It can't stay.
[2228.52 → 2229.72] Yeah, we have our own problems.
[2229.72 → 2239.52] If that was ever unclear, whenever we are pointing out issues in other countries...
[2239.52 → 2240.96] We have plenty of our...
[2240.96 → 2243.06] That is not because we are not...
[2243.06 → 2243.96] We have huge ones, actually.
[2244.18 → 2247.52] ...acutely aware of the problems that we have here in Canada.
[2247.66 → 2254.50] When your GDP per capita goes up by 0.5% over the course of 10 years, you got some things to work out.
[2254.50 → 2259.10] So, Bobby says, please do the all good news WAN show soon.
[2259.32 → 2260.34] I'm tired, man.
[2260.36 → 2261.52] We've tried multiple times.
[2261.74 → 2262.30] We've tried.
[2262.30 → 2263.84] We genuinely really tried multiple times.
[2264.28 → 2265.90] Hey, I got some good news for you.
[2266.32 → 2267.84] On LTV Store right now...
[2267.84 → 2267.86] There's a sale!
[2267.86 → 2267.88] Yeah!
[2267.88 → 2273.38] You get free worldwide shipping on any order over $150.
[2274.04 → 2278.30] We've got an amazing promo running on our magnetic cable management essential solution.
[2278.72 → 2280.64] Don't forget, you can pick up the commuter backpack.
[2281.26 → 2282.86] I don't know if the price is going to go up for this.
[2282.92 → 2283.12] It might.
[2283.18 → 2283.56] It might not.
[2283.62 → 2284.04] I don't know.
[2284.16 → 2285.16] The prices could go up.
[2285.20 → 2285.98] They could stay the same.
[2286.42 → 2290.64] Our mouse pads are the same price no matter what size they are.
[2290.72 → 2291.68] Same for our water bottles.
[2291.94 → 2293.92] Oh, you can get a framework embroidered hoodie.
[2293.92 → 2298.06] I promise you that an all-over embroidered hoodie is going to cost a lot more than $150
[2298.06 → 2299.58] if it's made in the USA.
[2300.24 → 2301.10] Go, go, go!
[2302.82 → 2305.00] All right, what else we got today?
[2305.06 → 2305.98] Dan, what are we supposed to be doing?
[2306.56 → 2309.50] Oh, well, let's move maybe into some merch messages.
[2309.90 → 2310.24] Sure.
[2310.40 → 2311.74] Sure, let's do that.
[2312.22 → 2317.66] If you're not familiar, the way to leave a merch message and interact with the show
[2317.66 → 2322.30] is to go to LTTstore.com and check out our free worldwide shipping on orders over $150.
[2322.74 → 2323.26] Okay, okay.
[2323.26 → 2327.86] Anyway, add an item to your cart, and you'll see the merch message field pop up.
[2327.92 → 2329.12] You go ahead and populate that.
[2329.20 → 2333.66] It'll go to producer Dan who will do something with it.
[2333.94 → 2336.00] Today, realistically, there's going to be a lot of them.
[2336.20 → 2338.62] So we'll get to as many of them as we can.
[2339.56 → 2343.34] Or Dan will reply to them himself and his fingers will get arthritis.
[2343.74 → 2346.30] Or he will forward it to someone internally and get an answer for you.
[2346.34 → 2348.22] Whatever the case may be, Dan will take care of it.
[2348.22 → 2352.18] And some of them will be curated for me and Luke to address.
[2352.32 → 2354.50] Dan, go ahead and show them how that works.
[2355.16 → 2355.64] Absolutely.
[2355.98 → 2357.26] So first one I've got for you here.
[2357.66 → 2359.94] Do you think the Switch 2 is a unique position?
[2360.12 → 2362.74] Because it still has exclusives, not on other platforms,
[2362.96 → 2365.90] while most AAA games are cross-play compatible.
[2365.90 → 2368.70] Or would that cause a decline for Nintendo?
[2369.10 → 2374.44] Dude, I think Nintendo, by sticking to making, keeping a console,
[2374.78 → 2377.70] has actually crushed it.
[2377.70 → 2380.10] There are two companies selling closed-down computers,
[2380.32 → 2381.94] and there's one company selling a console.
[2381.94 → 2387.88] Nintendo seems to be the only horse left in the console race.
[2388.40 → 2393.62] And to be clear, I'm not saying that I disagree with Microsoft's move
[2393.62 → 2398.62] to make the Xbox and the PC a more cohesive ecosystem.
[2398.86 → 2404.90] In fact, I think they could do more to make them more value-added to each other.
[2405.28 → 2406.62] Like, we're owning a PC.
[2406.74 → 2408.62] Right now, if you own a decent PC,
[2408.62 → 2411.74] I can't think of any good reason to have an Xbox.
[2412.38 → 2416.02] I want to want the Xbox app on my computer.
[2417.42 → 2418.16] Oh, dude.
[2418.56 → 2420.30] And right now, I super don't.
[2420.34 → 2422.88] All it does is kind of get in my way when I'm trying to do something.
[2422.94 → 2423.40] Super annoying.
[2423.40 → 2425.08] And maybe part of that is just because
[2425.08 → 2429.82] I've already solved all the problems that the Xbox app would solve for me.
[2430.60 → 2431.96] Because I'm, like, old school.
[2432.08 → 2435.40] Like, maybe if I was a young kid who came from Xbox and got a PC,
[2435.64 → 2437.12] I'd be like, oh, yeah, Xbox app.
[2437.16 → 2438.04] That's how I screen record.
[2438.04 → 2438.76] That's how I do that.
[2438.86 → 2440.14] Whereas I'll just open OBS.
[2440.48 → 2441.58] So maybe that's part of it.
[2441.78 → 2443.04] But also, I just...
[2443.78 → 2447.20] There's certain default behaviours that just don't make any sense to me.
[2447.46 → 2450.92] Like the fact that I press the Xbox button on my controller
[2450.92 → 2452.16] when I'm in Steam big picture.
[2452.24 → 2455.64] And by default, Microsoft puts their Xbox overlay in front of...
[2455.64 → 2457.82] I'm using fucking Steam right now.
[2457.98 → 2459.86] I am not using Xbox app right now.
[2459.90 → 2462.56] I get why you want the Xbox button to do Xbox things.
[2462.56 → 2468.00] But then you got to work with partners like Valve to make sure that the Xbox button doesn't
[2468.00 → 2471.00] do really important things in Steam as well, right?
[2471.04 → 2471.72] Like, it's just...
[2471.72 → 2472.74] It's not cohesive.
[2473.38 → 2474.46] And I don't...
[2474.46 → 2476.14] Again, I don't have the solutions.
[2477.14 → 2477.84] Yeah, me neither.
[2477.84 → 2480.32] But I definitely can identify the problems.
[2480.66 → 2486.76] You know, it's not as bad as like the Vista era games for Windows Live trash.
[2486.92 → 2487.82] It's not as bad as that.
[2488.08 → 2488.18] Yeah.
[2488.18 → 2493.34] But you still have like, you know, Sforza Horizon 5.
[2494.06 → 2494.98] It was a great game.
[2495.80 → 2500.58] Practically impossible to play with your friends because trying to do the Microsoft version
[2500.58 → 2502.94] of friends stuff was just an absolute nightmare.
[2502.94 → 2509.00] The one that I feel will be left out in the cold either way, now that Microsoft has quadrupled
[2509.00 → 2515.42] down on functionally just being a game publisher, game developer behemoth, is Sony.
[2515.42 → 2521.40] Because I don't really understand what the identity of the PlayStation is going to be
[2521.40 → 2526.76] when it's just, functionally speaking, a timed exclusive box, right?
[2526.82 → 2533.22] Like, it's a hardware access key for timed exclusives, as far as I can tell.
[2533.66 → 2540.04] The Dual Sense controller is outstanding and works best on PlayStation, so that's something.
[2541.90 → 2544.34] What else are they doing?
[2544.34 → 2549.70] And to be clear, I think they have, I don't think there's really any debate that they won
[2549.70 → 2553.76] this generation between them and Microsoft, right?
[2553.84 → 2556.34] Like, the Xbox series, like...
[2557.20 → 2557.92] They won the battle.
[2558.12 → 2565.34] Man, I do honestly think that a significant part of Microsoft's challenges with Xbox come
[2566.18 → 2567.94] down to the confusing naming scheme.
[2568.32 → 2568.96] Oh, I agree.
[2568.96 → 2571.90] Like, dude, we saw what happened to the Wii U, right?
[2572.04 → 2575.56] And Microsoft saw that and was like, let's go even worse.
[2575.70 → 2579.94] I'm not 100% confident of what the current one is.
[2580.76 → 2582.74] It's the Xbox Series X.
[2582.88 → 2583.54] Yeah, I thought so.
[2583.58 → 2585.66] So that replaced the Xbox One X.
[2586.60 → 2589.80] And also there's a Series S that replaced the Xbox One S.
[2589.92 → 2591.74] And before that was the Xbox...
[2591.74 → 2592.66] Uh, oh crap.
[2593.56 → 2593.88] One?
[2594.88 → 2595.46] Oh, shoot.
[2595.54 → 2596.22] Was there a One X?
[2596.76 → 2597.08] Crap.
[2597.20 → 2597.46] Uh-oh.
[2597.68 → 2598.62] I think there was a One X.
[2598.64 → 2599.10] Yeah, one.
[2599.42 → 2599.96] Yeah, that's right.
[2599.98 → 2600.80] This is the problem.
[2601.14 → 2604.58] And then before that was the 360, and then before that was the Xbox.
[2604.58 → 2607.38] But the original Xbox and the Xbox 360 were great names.
[2608.06 → 2609.02] I disagree.
[2609.38 → 2610.08] I like 360.
[2611.56 → 2614.08] Remember all the speculation that the next one would be 720?
[2614.08 → 2614.10] 720?
[2614.42 → 2614.66] Yeah.
[2614.66 → 2618.64] Even that would have been better than what we have now.
[2618.88 → 2620.74] But it should have just been Xbox 2.
[2621.16 → 2621.50] Period.
[2621.76 → 2622.24] I'm sorry.
[2622.38 → 2624.08] I can't get behind...
[2624.08 → 2625.94] They could have even pulled...
[2625.94 → 2626.94] What's their nuts?
[2627.02 → 2627.76] Who did this?
[2627.88 → 2628.30] I forget.
[2628.72 → 2630.98] Someone recently on the phone side...
[2630.98 → 2632.04] Was it Samsung or something?
[2632.08 → 2632.62] I can't remember.
[2632.70 → 2633.92] But one of them basically like...
[2633.92 → 2634.78] Or maybe it was Apple.
[2635.16 → 2638.38] That like skipped a number or something so that they could...
[2638.38 → 2642.44] So that they could kind of realign things with, you know, years or something like that.
[2642.44 → 2642.76] I forget.
[2642.86 → 2643.38] Someone did this.
[2643.38 → 2644.64] Didn't they do that when they went to the X?
[2644.72 → 2644.76] iPhone X?
[2644.76 → 2645.62] But I could see...
[2645.62 → 2650.14] Like, I could see Microsoft just skipping two and going straight to three so that it's
[2650.14 → 2652.88] clear that the Xbox 3 competes against the PlayStation 3.
[2653.14 → 2656.18] So they could kind of get realigned.
[2658.58 → 2658.94] But...
[2658.94 → 2660.02] I think they could have done that.
[2660.06 → 2663.94] I think they could have done that with the 360 naming and then gone to like 460, 560,
[2664.04 → 2664.28] whatever.
[2664.72 → 2666.66] And just had it not been based on the circle.
[2667.68 → 2669.76] So I think it was called 360 because of the circle.
[2669.98 → 2670.16] Sure.
[2670.22 → 2672.56] But they could have done Xbox Infinity and done two circles.
[2672.56 → 2674.22] Or they could have done freaking anything.
[2674.48 → 2674.64] Yeah.
[2674.78 → 2675.76] Other than one.
[2676.10 → 2676.32] Yeah.
[2676.78 → 2677.56] One was terrible.
[2677.72 → 2678.54] One X was terrible.
[2678.70 → 2679.56] Series X was terrible.
[2679.70 → 2680.48] It's all been terrible.
[2681.30 → 2683.14] 360, I definitely agree, is debatable.
[2683.16 → 2684.58] I liked it, but it's very debatable.
[2684.68 → 2685.98] I can understand someone not liking it.
[2686.30 → 2688.54] Beyond there, it's just trash.
[2688.54 → 2691.84] And it's a funny thing because I don't...
[2691.84 → 2696.54] I don't know any living, breathing...
[2697.32 → 2700.80] Like through their nose, not like through their mouth.
[2700.90 → 2702.24] Like I don't know any non...
[2702.24 → 2702.92] Actually, no.
[2703.00 → 2703.88] I don't know any...
[2703.88 → 2710.70] Any even remotely functional human capable of producing words that thinks that the Xbox
[2710.70 → 2711.74] naming scheme is good.
[2712.08 → 2713.22] So who are the...
[2713.22 → 2714.24] Who is driving this?
[2714.24 → 2717.94] I actually want to like interview them.
[2718.52 → 2719.16] Middle managers.
[2719.66 → 2720.46] No, I can't...
[2720.46 → 2721.22] It can't be.
[2721.44 → 2724.30] It can't be because middle managers would take the safe route.
[2724.86 → 2727.50] Only executives can do something that fucking stupid.
[2730.50 → 2732.50] Middle managers have to get buy-in.
[2732.62 → 2732.96] We should...
[2732.96 → 2734.10] We should get Phil Spencer.
[2734.20 → 2734.72] He would never.
[2734.88 → 2739.50] But we should get Phil Spencer to join Wayne Show and just be like, what's going on?
[2740.20 → 2742.04] I'm sure he's been asked this a thousand times.
[2742.06 → 2747.40] You're wanting to get more and more into the PC space and make the Xbox ecosystem a big thing.
[2747.46 → 2748.78] You're trying to partner with handhelds.
[2748.78 → 2749.62] You're trying to do stuff like that.
[2749.78 → 2750.76] That's our realm.
[2750.96 → 2753.72] If you want buy-in with this community, come here.
[2753.82 → 2754.42] Come on our show.
[2754.54 → 2755.00] Talk to us.
[2755.02 → 2756.42] Yeah, we'll talk to the community.
[2756.62 → 2757.90] Yeah, because we don't understand.
[2758.08 → 2761.16] So if you can make us understand, you're going to have a huge win.
[2762.70 → 2763.54] Come join the show.
[2763.80 → 2764.32] Talk to us.
[2767.08 → 2768.20] He's not going to talk to us.
[2768.26 → 2768.76] He never will.
[2769.50 → 2769.98] He never will.
[2771.04 → 2771.94] What was the question?
[2771.98 → 2774.40] But seriously, I think it's reasonable.
[2775.22 → 2776.26] Oh, hold on.
[2776.34 → 2777.48] I wanted to go somewhere else with that.
[2777.50 → 2778.28] He won't, but I think it would be reasonable.
[2778.32 → 2779.38] I wanted to go somewhere else with that.
[2780.26 → 2782.60] Do you think that Nintendo...
[2782.60 → 2784.82] Because I think Switch 2 will be successful.
[2784.98 → 2787.08] I don't think it's going to be Switch 1 successful.
[2787.18 → 2787.26] No.
[2787.26 → 2788.60] I don't think it's going to be Wii successful.
[2788.80 → 2789.30] No.
[2789.76 → 2791.02] There's no great secret.
[2791.38 → 2797.94] Nintendo knocks it out of the park when they deliver cheap enough hardware and great games.
[2798.28 → 2798.88] That's the formula.
[2798.88 → 2803.52] And I don't think the Switch 2 delivers on that formula quiet.
[2803.64 → 2808.84] I think $450 is something that will end up under people's Christmas trees, but not as many.
[2808.98 → 2812.48] And that's going to hurt their ability to build an enormous library for it.
[2812.48 → 2815.52] And all of those things that sort of those knock-on effects.
[2815.72 → 2817.52] They also lost the Reggie factor.
[2817.52 → 2823.16] So the Wii Sports equivalent, whatever it's called now, the stupid tutorial thing is paid...
[2823.16 → 2823.22] It's $10.
[2823.86 → 2824.50] You've got to be...
[2824.50 → 2824.92] They've got to be high for that.
[2824.92 → 2826.62] I don't care how many dollars it is.
[2826.66 → 2827.28] Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[2827.42 → 2827.92] It needs to be zero.
[2828.04 → 2828.82] It should be zero.
[2828.96 → 2829.16] Yeah.
[2829.24 → 2829.38] Yeah.
[2829.86 → 2830.58] Agreed 100%.
[2830.58 → 2832.50] Like, they're losing those types of things, which is bad.
[2832.52 → 2833.42] But tell me this.
[2833.62 → 2835.58] Because I think Switch 2 is going to do fine.
[2835.64 → 2838.00] I don't think it's going to be a Wii U, but I don't think it's going to be a Wii.
[2838.34 → 2838.48] Yeah.
[2838.48 → 2840.46] What about...
[2840.46 → 2841.24] What's coming next?
[2842.06 → 2842.50] Yeah, I don't know.
[2842.58 → 2844.30] There isn't a lot of...
[2844.30 → 2846.76] Like, VR seems like a dead end.
[2846.88 → 2847.58] Sony gave up.
[2849.38 → 2853.50] Motion control was super innovative and cool at the time.
[2853.60 → 2858.32] But even Nintendo seems to have mostly given up on that, aside from, you know, like, wank
[2858.32 → 2860.18] minigames in Mario Party or whatever.
[2860.18 → 2864.76] I don't think Nintendo's going to do anything that you put on your face.
[2866.16 → 2866.36] Mm-hmm.
[2866.36 → 2869.22] I don't think Nintendo's going to do VR or AR.
[2870.04 → 2872.16] So, like, are we just...
[2872.16 → 2873.22] Is it just Switch 3?
[2873.62 → 2874.32] Switch 4?
[2874.42 → 2874.88] Switch 5?
[2875.14 → 2877.12] Like, because that was the whole thing with Nintendo.
[2877.22 → 2883.74] That was their identity, was they didn't need to compete toe-to-toe with the, you know,
[2883.80 → 2886.00] the HD juggernaut when they had...
[2886.00 → 2889.92] Oh, but we have second screen that you can, like, sit on the toilet and stream your game
[2889.92 → 2890.02] from.
[2890.20 → 2892.26] Like, they had the gimmick factor.
[2892.60 → 2893.70] What is Switch 2's gimmick?
[2893.70 → 2893.88] They did.
[2893.96 → 2894.68] I know they did.
[2894.78 → 2895.70] Like, a sh**thank you mouse?
[2895.70 → 2896.42] They were going to in the future.
[2897.78 → 2898.64] Um, yeah, the sh...
[2898.64 → 2899.04] The...
[2899.04 → 2900.64] The shitty mouse thing is weird.
[2901.90 → 2902.12] Yep.
[2902.22 → 2902.58] My bad.
[2905.66 → 2906.62] Like, what is that?
[2907.48 → 2908.14] And you know what?
[2908.20 → 2910.12] Maybe I'm going to be so wrong.
[2910.38 → 2911.32] Oh, I think people will use it.
[2911.38 → 2913.04] I still think it's going to be better for shooter games than the phone stick.
[2913.04 → 2918.14] Like, maybe they're going to use it for, like, you know, weird, you know, leg wank game
[2918.14 → 2919.14] or something like that.
[2919.18 → 2919.92] So you can...
[2919.92 → 2920.50] Well, I don't...
[2920.50 → 2920.94] I don't know.
[2921.02 → 2921.50] Like, like, you...
[2921.50 → 2923.14] Because you can use an optical sensor for anything.
[2923.30 → 2924.28] It doesn't have to be a mouse pointer.
[2924.28 → 2924.90] Here's a question.
[2925.00 → 2927.10] There were a sports game for Switch, right?
[2928.44 → 2928.80] Um...
[2928.80 → 2930.52] The Wii Sports equivalent thing?
[2930.94 → 2932.88] I think there was some kind of sports game for Switch.
[2932.88 → 2935.44] I don't remember what the deal was with it, though.
[2935.90 → 2937.68] Switch sports game.
[2939.76 → 2940.88] Nintendo Switch Sports.
[2941.20 → 2941.40] Yeah.
[2941.44 → 2942.20] Did anyone care?
[2942.20 → 2946.28] I don't know, but I feel like they kind of need it.
[2946.28 → 2949.68] Like, if a Nintendo Switch Sports falls in a forest, does anyone hear it?
[2949.72 → 2950.80] Like, I don't...
[2951.80 → 2953.56] Like, here's a potentially hot take.
[2953.56 → 2954.90] Error Mean says, I love it.
[2955.14 → 2957.24] And Interested Panda says, wasn't good.
[2957.34 → 2958.16] So, uh...
[2958.16 → 2958.44] All right.
[2958.44 → 2965.92] I think if they effectively just took Wii Sports and spruced it up a wee bit...
[2965.92 → 2966.24] Get it?
[2966.78 → 2973.58] And put it on Switch 2 and made it free, like it was with the original Wii, I think the
[2973.58 → 2974.36] Switch 2 would kill.
[2974.74 → 2975.06] Because...
[2975.06 → 2976.42] Isn't the new tutorial paid, right?
[2976.60 → 2976.80] Yeah.
[2976.90 → 2977.06] Stupid.
[2977.30 → 2978.54] I'm not even talking about the tutorial, though.
[2978.66 → 2980.58] I'm talking about a sports game.
[2980.68 → 2981.34] A bundle game.
[2981.34 → 2985.94] It wasn't just the tutorial features of Wii Sports that people liked.
[2985.98 → 2987.88] People genuinely really liked the game.
[2988.12 → 2988.26] Yeah.
[2988.30 → 2990.20] I had a fun time playing Wii Sports.
[2990.58 → 2992.26] And anyone any age could play it.
[2992.36 → 2992.76] Absolutely.
[2992.94 → 2994.62] And that's Nintendo's killer thing.
[2994.62 → 2999.52] That was probably the first thing, the first gaming experience, the only gaming experience
[2999.52 → 3001.08] that I ever shared with my in-laws.
[3001.56 → 3001.74] Yeah.
[3002.70 → 3003.56] My mom loved it.
[3003.64 → 3005.18] My dad at least liked it.
[3005.40 → 3007.24] The Wii brought us together in the living room.
[3007.32 → 3007.56] Yes.
[3007.60 → 3008.14] In a way that...
[3008.14 → 3009.00] And that's what Nintendo does.
[3009.02 → 3009.76] The Switch doesn't.
[3009.76 → 3012.02] And that's why I'm saying they're not going to make something that goes on your face.
[3012.26 → 3015.04] Because they want it to be a family thing.
[3015.12 → 3017.64] All of their commercials, there's multiple people playing.
[3017.92 → 3022.64] You think about Xbox or PlayStation commercial, maybe they show people playing together online,
[3022.92 → 3024.52] but not usually in the same room anymore.
[3024.62 → 3024.76] Yep.
[3024.84 → 3026.68] And it's like, the lights are out.
[3026.80 → 3026.96] Yeah.
[3027.02 → 3027.96] And there's RGB.
[3028.54 → 3028.94] Gamer mode!
[3028.94 → 3030.20] And someone's locked in.
[3030.34 → 3035.72] Switch is often multiple people hanging out in a brightly lit same room situation.
[3036.38 → 3037.58] So what are they going to do?
[3037.58 → 3038.32] I think they've got to embrace that.
[3038.32 → 3039.66] What are they going to do to move that forward?
[3039.76 → 3043.10] I think they tripped on the release, personally.
[3043.48 → 3047.02] That tutorial thing should have been free, and it should have actually just been a sport
[3047.02 → 3049.02] game that also had tutorial features.
[3050.46 → 3051.72] And then I think they would have...
[3051.72 → 3054.40] So you just say, look, take the Wii format, rinse, repeat.
[3055.00 → 3059.60] And they've said up front that they're aiming to make money on the hardware this time.
[3059.60 → 3062.68] I don't work for Nintendo.
[3062.98 → 3065.54] I don't know their mind.
[3066.86 → 3069.08] And we could be wrong.
[3069.42 → 3075.16] And I could be wrong, but I feel like, why are they breaking a formula that has worked
[3075.16 → 3078.78] so well, and then every time that they've deviated from it has not worked?
[3078.78 → 3079.12] Yeah.
[3079.24 → 3080.98] Get consoles in people's houses.
[3081.28 → 3081.96] It works.
[3082.28 → 3085.38] And then they'll buy games every once in a while because they want something new to do.
[3085.50 → 3090.20] Because the buying of the game is an easier cost to stomach, even with the inflated price,
[3090.58 → 3093.12] than a whole freaking console.
[3093.12 → 3099.80] Like, how big, how excited do you think people would have been if the Switch 2 was launching
[3099.80 → 3104.74] and Mario Kart World was a pack-in for $450?
[3105.28 → 3106.62] Oh, dude, that would have cranked.
[3106.68 → 3107.56] People would have gone nuts.
[3107.76 → 3108.50] Yeah, 100%.
[3108.50 → 3110.00] And they could have been temporary.
[3110.62 → 3113.84] Like, they could have done it for the first month or the first three months or something
[3113.84 → 3114.38] like that.
[3114.44 → 3116.30] Because think about how the original Xbox sold, right?
[3117.32 → 3117.72] Halo.
[3118.50 → 3118.64] Yeah.
[3118.64 → 3121.78] And it wasn't a pack-in, but everybody bought it with Halo.
[3121.78 → 3129.60] But what would happen is they would essentially turbocharge, pun intended, the adoption of
[3129.60 → 3132.86] this new console while generating some revenue.
[3133.04 → 3137.18] And realistically, over the lifespan, I mean, if Mario Kart World is going to be another 10
[3137.18 → 3142.26] year game, like we saw with Mario Kart 8, they will make back their development costs once
[3142.26 → 3143.16] they stop packing it in.
[3143.20 → 3144.40] People will still buy it.
[3145.10 → 3147.64] Yeah, like, for the first two, three months it's packed in.
[3147.68 → 3148.28] Sure, that'd be interesting.
[3148.62 → 3150.20] Here's a hot take on Switch 3.
[3150.20 → 3153.34] I think I've devised what they do.
[3153.76 → 3155.14] Okay, I'd love to hear it.
[3155.48 → 3159.20] Camera with AI detection of movement and tracking.
[3159.86 → 3162.80] Okay, yeah, that could probably be done by the time a Switch 3 rolls around.
[3162.92 → 3165.16] Like sports things or dance games or whatever.
[3165.18 → 3166.08] Bring back dance games.
[3166.18 → 3168.98] Where there's, like, actually perfect tracking on things.
[3169.06 → 3171.86] So they're not wank games anymore.
[3171.86 → 3177.92] Holy shit, you could bring back Rock Band because you could just do everything with the camera.
[3178.20 → 3180.92] So the peripherals wouldn't even need to be plugged in.
[3181.14 → 3181.34] Yeah.
[3181.86 → 3183.16] That would actually be sick.
[3183.34 → 3183.56] Yeah.
[3183.56 → 3188.54] And we're assuming, you know, that it's going to be another six to eight years.
[3188.90 → 3189.22] Probably.
[3189.42 → 3195.52] We're assuming that the kind of AI processing that you'll be able to do on a little, you
[3195.52 → 3201.46] know, thing will advance far enough to do that kind of real-time tracking of, like, drumming
[3201.46 → 3202.26] and whatever else.
[3202.26 → 3204.60] That stuff might be a little bit rough right now, but you can do a lot of that right now
[3204.60 → 3205.18] on a phone.
[3205.52 → 3205.68] Yeah.
[3205.72 → 3208.06] So, like, yeah, give us eight years.
[3208.14 → 3209.88] It should be pretty cheap to pack into a console.
[3210.04 → 3210.38] Interesting.
[3210.54 → 3217.14] You could do, you could play Wii Sports with just, like, like, actually probably better
[3217.14 → 3217.86] motion controls.
[3217.90 → 3220.58] And you could have a really rudimentary gyroscope in.
[3220.72 → 3220.98] Sure.
[3221.14 → 3222.40] You could have some controller.
[3222.56 → 3224.80] I just think you could use full skeleton tracking.
[3225.32 → 3226.42] You could probably do it.
[3226.54 → 3226.76] Yeah.
[3227.60 → 3229.22] I feel like it'll be something like that.
[3229.22 → 3234.84] Because Nintendo is going to try to get you, yeah, together and up and moving and family
[3234.84 → 3235.96] friendly and stuff like that.
[3236.18 → 3238.08] So I think, I think this could work.
[3239.22 → 3244.84] And, and my, my hint for it was that they are selling cameras for the Switch right now.
[3244.96 → 3245.26] Yeah.
[3245.36 → 3245.72] Okay.
[3245.82 → 3246.22] All right.
[3246.30 → 3247.72] That's, that's a path forward.
[3247.80 → 3248.34] That's something.
[3249.00 → 3249.74] That's something.
[3249.92 → 3250.22] Okay.
[3251.22 → 3252.04] Um, Dan.
[3252.44 → 3253.26] Hey, LLD.
[3253.26 → 3259.14] With Anno117 coming out this year, allegedly, what improvements or quality of life are you
[3259.14 → 3260.94] hoping for in the franchise?
[3261.22 → 3264.44] At this point, I'm hoping they just don't Civ 7, the UI.
[3264.68 → 3266.16] I have the lamest take on this in the world.
[3266.30 → 3267.54] Anna 1800 was perfect.
[3267.68 → 3270.30] And if they just do that with a skin, then it'll be a great game.
[3270.42 → 3273.18] This is the lamest take in the world and have the exact same one.
[3273.22 → 3276.70] I mean, they put, dude, how all good games should work.
[3276.70 → 3277.48] Just give me a cool theme.
[3277.48 → 3279.88] And really don't change a bunch.
[3280.18 → 3284.54] A lot of the expansions for Anna 1800 were really just more of the same.
[3284.74 → 3284.90] Yep.
[3284.98 → 3285.92] And they were great.
[3286.96 → 3296.12] And, uh, yeah, that team put so much love and care into, into what they do.
[3296.24 → 3298.84] There's so much depth to the gameplay.
[3298.84 → 3301.48] Uh, the voice acting is, is great.
[3301.60 → 3303.90] The characters are so fun.
[3303.90 → 3308.36] And it, like, I, I actually never played the campaign.
[3309.44 → 3310.00] I did.
[3310.10 → 3311.92] I dabbled, like, a tiny bit, but I, like.
[3312.08 → 3312.62] It's pretty good.
[3312.82 → 3313.36] Okay, cool.
[3313.66 → 3314.00] It's.
[3315.06 → 3316.12] I didn't really need it.
[3316.14 → 3316.64] Yeah, it's pretty good.
[3316.76 → 3317.42] I just love.
[3317.48 → 3318.82] It's really not a big deal.
[3318.92 → 3321.54] And I don't think it needs to get much better, personally.
[3321.74 → 3323.10] They could make it a little better, I'm sure.
[3323.44 → 3325.72] There are some possibilities there, but I don't think it needs a dramatic change.
[3325.72 → 3330.84] It's basically just the multiplayer, but with some, like, themed tasks.
[3331.20 → 3334.76] And I love how they handled their, their microtransactions.
[3335.08 → 3342.54] Um, they felt more like classic game expansions because they really did literally expand the game.
[3342.68 → 3344.20] Which made me completely cool with it.
[3344.26 → 3350.46] Everything that was great about it and made it bigger and better and deeper.
[3350.46 → 3353.98] And with, again, back to what I just said, with love.
[3354.40 → 3356.36] With thought, with care, with love.
[3356.42 → 3361.58] Making sure that the expansions don't wreck the balance of the original game.
[3361.72 → 3361.86] Yeah.
[3362.08 → 3364.00] And destroy what was great about it.
[3364.12 → 3364.28] Yeah.
[3364.98 → 3369.44] And make it so you don't need the, the, you don't need them.
[3369.62 → 3371.76] You can still just play the original game and enjoy it.
[3371.76 → 3376.82] Uh, the only thing is, and, and the way the multiplayer works is depending on which expansions
[3376.82 → 3381.50] you each own, you just activate or disable them for your, your joint play session.
[3381.50 → 3385.18] So not everyone has to have, you know, sunken treasures or whatever else.
[3385.20 → 3386.42] You don't have to have every expansion.
[3386.62 → 3391.90] So there are things that I think they could improve, but I wouldn't want like dramatic changes.
[3391.90 → 3394.12] Like, I bet you they could make expeditions a little bit cooler.
[3394.14 → 3394.40] Okay.
[3394.40 → 3397.84] Would you want them to be like, uh, like grittier?
[3398.28 → 3403.40] Like, could your people, could your people need like, uh, do you need to have like anti-drug
[3403.40 → 3407.48] enforcement or something like, like, could, could they make it like, like grittier?
[3407.84 → 3408.72] I don't think so, to be honest.
[3408.72 → 3409.22] I'm just, I'm just an idea.
[3409.48 → 3409.70] Okay.
[3409.72 → 3410.64] What about land combat?
[3410.74 → 3415.48] Cause the original Anna, Anna 1602 had land combat.
[3415.56 → 3416.34] It was kind of terrible.
[3416.44 → 3417.86] It was Jacky, but it existed.
[3418.08 → 3423.36] And it was an aspect of conquering islands that in my opinion, conquering islands is a bit too
[3423.36 → 3423.72] easy.
[3423.72 → 3426.72] In Anna 1800, at least against the AI characters.
[3426.90 → 3428.28] You don't have to, there's no land campaign.
[3428.38 → 3429.20] You don't have to do anything.
[3429.30 → 3430.92] You just destroy their, their warehouse.
[3431.20 → 3435.72] And, and there's also economic victory where you can like to buy shares on their island, but
[3435.72 → 3438.86] there's no, there's no land campaign.
[3438.96 → 3440.42] You can't conquer stuff.
[3440.48 → 3441.92] You can't take over what's there.
[3442.34 → 3445.62] So there's no actual capture of anything.
[3445.62 → 3447.20] I'd love to see, okay, you know what?
[3447.24 → 3448.42] No, I got ideas.
[3448.68 → 3453.54] I mean, it won't help with 11, 11, seven or whatever it is because it's, it's too, it's
[3453.54 → 3458.42] too old, but I would have loved to see like naval, uh, naval combat.
[3459.10 → 3468.42] Not just, not just firing cannons at each other, but I'd love to see ship to ship combat, like, uh, or sorry, ship to ship, uh, hand-to-hand combat where you can capture a ship.
[3468.66 → 3468.84] Yeah.
[3468.94 → 3469.40] Thank you.
[3469.46 → 3469.74] Boarding.
[3469.80 → 3470.78] That's the word I was looking for.
[3471.16 → 3471.28] Yeah.
[3471.28 → 3471.90] That'd be kind of cool.
[3471.92 → 3473.04] I don't know how you do that mechanic.
[3473.28 → 3473.90] Boarding on the water.
[3473.90 → 3474.82] You could have waterboarding.
[3477.28 → 3478.04] In the bay.
[3478.40 → 3483.64] Um, I don't know how you do that mechanic, um, in a top-down game.
[3484.70 → 3485.38] Super well.
[3485.68 → 3488.18] I mean, you could, you could, you could do it.
[3488.18 → 3488.42] I'm sure there's some way.
[3488.42 → 3489.90] This has been done before.
[3490.04 → 3498.68] So you could, you could approach the enemy ship, and then you could just have an event that pops up that basically goes auto call or manually fight.
[3498.68 → 3499.66] So what's the other one, basically?
[3499.86 → 3501.70] Where it would switch to like an RTS.
[3501.88 → 3502.14] So it's an RTS game?
[3503.02 → 3509.76] Cause that's, and it wouldn't be, it wouldn't, like you could, as someone who only ever played Anna 1800, you could go, oh, well that's not Anna.
[3510.40 → 3513.26] But 1602, literally the first game, had that.
[3513.26 → 3519.32] You could, you could grab your soldiers and click and move them around and fight and micromanage and like it was a bad RTS, but it was an RTS.
[3519.66 → 3519.84] Yeah.
[3519.86 → 3523.36] I don't, I don't know if there was a result there where it's actually good.
[3523.68 → 3525.36] That's one of the concerns that I think I have.
[3525.60 → 3525.82] Okay.
[3525.82 → 3526.20] That's fair.
[3526.38 → 3526.76] That's fair.
[3526.76 → 3536.34] Um, because in, in my opinion, one of the reasons why the naval combat works pretty well is because they needed to build a lot of those systems anyway for all the shipping and stuff.
[3537.34 → 3539.22] Um, so they're building on top of other systems.
[3539.34 → 3541.60] There is no other system that would use.
[3541.76 → 3542.84] Oh, what about bribery?
[3543.26 → 3545.22] Bribery would be an interesting element.
[3545.24 → 3545.44] Bribery would be cool.
[3545.66 → 3549.52] You know, you could, uh, tariffs would be interesting.
[3550.06 → 3551.42] Oh, doesn't that exist?
[3551.86 → 3555.66] Um, well you can charge more for goods or less for goods or whatever else.
[3555.68 → 3555.70] Yeah.
[3555.70 → 3556.60] And the people who just won't give them to you.
[3556.60 → 3560.20] Man, trade is so complicated to build a good interface for.
[3560.38 → 3565.34] Like, even loving Anna, I don't really use trade with the NPCs much.
[3565.38 → 3569.20] I just trade amongst my own stuff because it's just, it's kind of too much work.
[3569.20 → 3576.82] Um, or I'll, I'll, I'll set like, uh, certain things like, uh, the, the, the guy who runs the prison, he buys soap at a good price.
[3576.82 → 3581.42] So I'll distribute soap from my production island to all my islands that need it.
[3581.42 → 3585.30] And then I'll dump whatever's left at his island before going back to pick up more.
[3585.44 → 3591.74] So if you have a like a surplus production in your, in your, um, nation or whatever, then you can like, you can make money that way.
[3591.74 → 3594.72] But it's generally speaking a little bit too tedious.
[3595.90 → 3599.02] Um, Hoopoe says that's getting pretty close to a total war game.
[3599.08 → 3599.46] That's fair.
[3599.58 → 3601.20] Maybe that's part of why I'm talking about it.
[3601.20 → 3603.88] Because I, I did enjoy total war games back in the day.
[3603.96 → 3604.80] I played a modern one.
[3604.90 → 3605.88] And I'm getting a concern.
[3605.88 → 3608.82] Like when you, when you have too many focuses for a team, that's true.
[3609.10 → 3612.38] You, it will inevitably diminish certain other things.
[3612.42 → 3612.84] That's fair.
[3612.88 → 3617.04] And it could alienate the people that really just like building sprawling empires.
[3617.04 → 3617.44] Yeah.
[3617.56 → 3621.70] I do think an ability to potentially do that.
[3621.76 → 3623.74] Like maybe, maybe you have certain ships.
[3624.30 → 3624.74] Spy craft.
[3625.88 → 3627.04] Spy craft would be sweet.
[3627.42 → 3628.64] But what would you spy?
[3628.74 → 3630.44] Because there's no tech tree in Anna.
[3630.64 → 3634.88] But if you could have them, uh, influence riots.
[3635.02 → 3635.42] Oh, sure.
[3635.52 → 3639.22] Or, or, uh, like, uh, economic sabotage.
[3639.36 → 3639.58] Yep.
[3639.96 → 3640.70] That would be interesting.
[3640.72 → 3643.36] So if you can screw up someone's like, uh, what are those things called?
[3643.40 → 3646.60] The, the like trade centres where you install the things, and it buffs the surrounding area.
[3646.60 → 3647.38] Oh, trade unions.
[3647.50 → 3647.88] Trade unions.
[3648.18 → 3650.40] If you could have them like sabotage trade unions.
[3650.54 → 3650.66] Yeah.
[3650.76 → 3651.58] That would be interesting.
[3652.42 → 3655.24] There, there could, there could be potentially interesting things that you could do there.
[3655.30 → 3655.54] All right.
[3655.58 → 3655.96] Well, sure.
[3656.02 → 3658.44] In that case, I'm excited for Anna 11.7.
[3658.78 → 3664.26] And, uh, if they made a ship that was built for boarding, but it was notably weaker.
[3664.98 → 3667.02] So you had to have it be part of a fleet.
[3667.30 → 3670.74] And then if you could damage another ship and then use that ship to board them.
[3670.78 → 3672.78] And then if you did that action, it just gave it to you.
[3672.78 → 3675.32] But then thinking about how much there is to do in Anna.
[3675.32 → 3677.62] Like, would you have time to micromanage that?
[3677.70 → 3678.42] Probably not.
[3678.76 → 3682.92] And that's part of what keeps it so engaging is that there's always something, one more,
[3682.92 → 3688.92] you know, shipment to attend to one more trade to complete one, one more expedition to follow
[3688.92 → 3689.38] up on.
[3689.56 → 3691.10] I think it might be kind of flow breaking.
[3691.26 → 3691.58] So maybe.
[3692.10 → 3692.82] Yeah, maybe not.
[3692.96 → 3693.32] You know what?
[3693.36 → 3694.30] I'm going to leave it to the experts.
[3694.62 → 3695.16] Oh, sorry.
[3695.20 → 3696.76] Is it 11.07 or 11.7?
[3696.84 → 3698.08] I actually, I actually don't know.
[3698.24 → 3699.12] I'm pretty confident.
[3699.12 → 3699.80] I haven't been paying attention.
[3699.80 → 3703.76] And I've said this before, and I've been super wrong, and I've said this before and been super
[3703.76 → 3704.02] right.
[3704.12 → 3704.70] So who knows?
[3704.80 → 3706.48] But I'm pretty confident it's going to be good.
[3707.04 → 3707.76] I hope so.
[3707.88 → 3713.58] I don't see, like looking at the pattern of actions that they did for 1800, I don't see
[3713.58 → 3718.92] them breaking that so much with the really positive community sentiment that they had and everything
[3718.92 → 3721.06] else to take some.
[3721.06 → 3722.46] They're also going to want to innovate though.
[3722.96 → 3723.10] Yeah.
[3723.10 → 3725.62] So they're going to take some risks and hey, they don't always work out.
[3725.62 → 3727.72] There's definitely areas that could be better.
[3728.22 → 3731.80] I think, I think, you know, visibility of incoming quests could be better.
[3732.14 → 3732.24] Yeah.
[3732.24 → 3735.06] I think expeditions could be more engaging.
[3735.50 → 3735.76] Yeah.
[3735.78 → 3739.34] Right now it's just like, it feels like a choosy your own adventure book.
[3739.60 → 3742.36] Where there's like almost always an obvious right answer.
[3742.76 → 3743.20] Yeah.
[3743.86 → 3744.16] Well.
[3744.36 → 3745.42] It's a little bit too easy.
[3745.48 → 3747.58] Or a lot of the time just isn't because.
[3747.84 → 3749.96] There is either no right answer or no good answer.
[3750.02 → 3752.94] Everything's a die roll, and it's just like, okay, this could have been automated.
[3753.20 → 3753.32] Yeah.
[3753.32 → 3754.70] It just doesn't feel super great.
[3755.62 → 3760.00] Um, it's not terrible or anything, but it's not super great.
[3760.56 → 3763.14] Um, Rod says Luke doesn't know.
[3763.24 → 3763.98] What do I not know?
[3764.66 → 3765.88] Oh, did I say, I don't know?
[3766.32 → 3766.72] Darn it.
[3767.02 → 3767.36] Darn it.
[3767.82 → 3768.30] Darn it.
[3768.66 → 3768.86] Okay.
[3769.18 → 3774.48] Um, yeah, I, there are things that they could improve, but I don't want dramatic changes.
[3774.50 → 3775.10] Hit us with one more.
[3776.10 → 3777.68] Do we even have a third?
[3778.00 → 3778.94] Oh, do we not?
[3779.04 → 3779.86] I mean, there's so many.
[3780.50 → 3783.54] Uh, yeah, but most of them are like, thank you for free shipping.
[3784.04 → 3785.08] Oh, that makes sense.
[3785.08 → 3786.04] Ha ha ha.
[3787.42 → 3788.40] My things.
[3789.54 → 3791.04] I have acquired goods.
[3791.40 → 3792.18] Thank you very much.
[3792.30 → 3792.58] Bless.
[3793.42 → 3796.88] I got one from Paraguay and from Portugal and so many from Australia.
[3797.16 → 3798.08] That's going to cost.
[3798.72 → 3799.16] Yep.
[3799.50 → 3800.14] Let's go.
[3800.62 → 3802.46] So they're just getting them in there before.
[3803.14 → 3804.84] We just sell a lot of stuff to make money.
[3804.94 → 3807.06] Let's eat all our margin by giving everyone free shipping.
[3807.06 → 3811.76] No, no, the more they order, the more we can kind of absorb the shipping cost, but also
[3811.76 → 3813.54] the more the shipment cost to send.
[3813.70 → 3815.02] Yeah, but you guys designed it.
[3815.40 → 3816.50] You guys designed it.
[3816.82 → 3818.20] They don't do math.
[3818.28 → 3819.38] I don't know if you want me to even break it down.
[3819.48 → 3820.66] I'm sure people have figured it out.
[3821.02 → 3823.62] You guys designed it in a particular way, which is interesting.
[3823.90 → 3824.22] We did?
[3824.42 → 3824.72] Yeah.
[3825.20 → 3825.80] What did we do?
[3825.86 → 3826.34] I'm curious.
[3826.46 → 3827.90] I know what we did, but what did we do?
[3828.08 → 3831.22] Well, there's the one primary discount on...
[3832.84 → 3833.30] Loop laptop.
[3833.30 → 3833.78] Where is it?
[3834.00 → 3834.34] Weep.
[3835.54 → 3835.94] Weep.
[3836.38 → 3837.44] You can't find it this way?
[3837.60 → 3837.74] Oh.
[3837.98 → 3838.42] Yeah, you can.
[3838.60 → 3839.02] There it is.
[3839.08 → 3839.42] There it is.
[3839.42 → 3840.96] One primary discount.
[3841.10 → 3843.74] You need $150 to break the ship storm.
[3844.02 → 3847.56] So if you already wanted MCM, this is now down to $79.
[3847.92 → 3851.74] If you top it up, there's a variety of ways to do this on the store to almost exactly $150.
[3852.02 → 3856.20] Then you get this, an item, and free shipping all for the original price.
[3857.16 → 3859.04] Oh, that's actually totally not what we did.
[3859.30 → 3860.38] Oh, okay.
[3860.54 → 3861.46] That's nice though.
[3861.68 → 3863.20] That's a crazy way to go about it.
[3863.30 → 3864.10] That's super cool.
[3864.72 → 3865.00] Yeah.
[3865.12 → 3866.02] No, that's not what we did.
[3866.02 → 3872.34] Basically, we just did the math for how little we're making on that and how much averaged
[3872.34 → 3879.06] out over the world shipping will probably cost us, knowing that our orders skew much more
[3879.06 → 3886.64] international when we do a shipping promo and hoping and praying that the other things
[3886.64 → 3891.56] that they add to the cart will be things with reasonable margin on them and that most
[3891.56 → 3895.98] people will exceed the exactly $150 and that we will come out ahead.
[3896.10 → 3897.14] Is that happening so far?
[3897.20 → 3897.66] Can you see?
[3898.62 → 3900.36] I mean, I can, I guess.
[3900.54 → 3901.26] Don't look.
[3902.26 → 3903.40] You don't think so, Dan?
[3903.86 → 3904.72] Because I don't feel like it's...
[3904.72 → 3906.18] I just thought I'd want to make him sweat a little bit.
[3907.26 → 3909.24] No, people are going crazy.
[3909.32 → 3909.54] Let's see.
[3909.58 → 3910.84] Because I think they just want...
[3910.84 → 3911.60] $199.
[3912.06 → 3913.48] They've been looking to do a big order.
[3913.56 → 3914.32] This person just doesn't care.
[3914.46 → 3914.80] $75.
[3915.94 → 3916.30] What?
[3916.34 → 3916.92] Who does that?
[3917.22 → 3919.02] Screw your sale.
[3919.02 → 3922.50] And the horse it rode in on.
[3923.20 → 3925.48] I didn't get the cable management stuff.
[3925.60 → 3926.52] Just whatever.
[3926.78 → 3928.84] I'm just, I'm just shopping like normal.
[3929.38 → 3929.82] Okay.
[3930.00 → 3930.64] I got one here.
[3930.76 → 3932.80] That's $330 from Poland.
[3932.98 → 3933.26] Damn.
[3933.38 → 3933.94] Oh boy.
[3934.40 → 3942.14] $159, $159, $189, $169, $199, $154, $199, $154, $154, $154.
[3942.30 → 3942.50] Sorry.
[3942.64 → 3943.46] My report...
[3943.46 → 3944.68] $154.
[3944.92 → 3946.30] Shopify changed their...
[3946.30 → 3946.88] $154.
[3946.98 → 3948.22] There's a lot of $154s.
[3948.22 → 3952.52] Shopify changed their dashboard and I like kind of don't know how to use it anymore.
[3953.24 → 3957.22] I don't spend that much time in it because we have, you know, people who work here whose
[3957.22 → 3958.78] job is to do that.
[3958.96 → 3966.18] People found you can get $4.97 over the free shipping with a specific set of things.
[3968.40 → 3970.34] And a bunch of people did it.
[3970.34 → 3974.64] The top-selling items though, actually, are the...
[3974.64 → 3975.06] Oh God.
[3975.70 → 3976.18] Yeah.
[3977.00 → 3977.52] Okay.
[3977.80 → 3979.22] We're going to be okay.
[3979.48 → 3983.80] Like realistically, this is about burning some inventory right now.
[3983.94 → 3985.50] And we are achieving that.
[3985.76 → 3985.92] Yeah.
[3985.92 → 3991.40] We're not doing much more other than achieving that right now.
[3991.58 → 3995.12] I will say though that the next best-selling item is actually commuter backpack.
[3995.80 → 3996.24] Oh, nice.
[3996.30 → 3997.42] So it's the MCM.
[3998.36 → 4001.48] Obviously, it's that essentials bundle that's crushing it.
[4001.54 → 4002.72] It's well in the lead.
[4002.84 → 4006.16] So with commuter backpack, if that's the only thing you buy, you just get free shipping on
[4006.16 → 4006.28] it.
[4006.28 → 4007.22] Not quite.
[4007.82 → 4008.06] Oh.
[4008.72 → 4011.22] Because the commuter backpack is $149.99.
[4011.72 → 4012.06] Nice.
[4013.60 → 4017.86] But there's lots of like relatively low cost items on the store that you could add to that.
[4019.10 → 4019.50] Yeah.
[4019.84 → 4021.30] Backpack is next.
[4021.42 → 4023.40] Oh, in terms of revenue dollars, not in terms of units.
[4023.48 → 4024.38] I'm not sorted by units.
[4024.50 → 4029.96] But yeah, no, it's cable management, commuter, backpack, screwdriver, precision screwdriver,
[4030.68 → 4031.52] framework hoodie.
[4031.64 → 4034.16] A lot of people seem to be waiting for a deal on the framework hoodie.
[4034.16 → 4035.86] So they're moving a bunch of those.
[4035.86 → 4036.30] Nice hoodie.
[4036.40 → 4037.02] I like wearing it.
[4037.08 → 4038.26] Water bottle scribe drivers.
[4038.40 → 4039.74] It's all the usual suspects.
[4040.84 → 4042.44] But hey, don't forget about the apparel.
[4043.46 → 4043.82] Yeah.
[4043.98 → 4044.70] Don't forget about that.
[4044.76 → 4045.80] Okay, Dan, hit me with one more.
[4046.32 → 4046.56] Oh, wait.
[4046.60 → 4047.22] No, two more topics.
[4047.34 → 4048.18] Let's do two more topics.
[4048.42 → 4048.56] Yep.
[4048.86 → 4049.90] I have to get some water anyway.
[4050.22 → 4050.68] All right.
[4051.52 → 4053.04] Jay's two cents is having an LTE.
[4055.02 → 4055.94] A tech fair.
[4056.66 → 4061.86] He's holding what he's calling the SoCal Tech Fair on May 3rd and May 4th.
[4061.86 → 4062.36] Let's go.
[4062.54 → 4065.84] You'll be able to meet awesome creators like Nitwit, Austin Evans,
[4065.86 → 4068.34] Jay himself, and more.
[4068.86 → 4071.72] They are promoting tech family feud.
[4071.88 → 4078.36] There's going to be some industry panels, raffles, sim rig challenge, and so much fun stuff.
[4078.46 → 4079.96] Let's go ahead and...
[4079.96 → 4080.40] Oh, shoot.
[4080.46 → 4081.34] That's a link to the video.
[4081.46 → 4083.70] I had actually wanted to go to the website.
[4083.70 → 4093.48] There's also a huge garage sale featuring burrower certified refurbished hardware and some of Jay's own lightly reviewed hardware as well.
[4094.36 → 4096.18] What is burrower?
[4096.18 → 4098.72] Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[4098.74 → 4099.66] Because they're like the...
[4100.38 → 4102.24] Like co-hosting or whatever.
[4102.32 → 4102.88] Yeah, yeah.
[4104.64 → 4105.78] Isn't Height...
[4105.78 → 4108.54] Is Height an affiliated brand with burrower?
[4108.64 → 4109.30] I actually don't know.
[4109.48 → 4110.10] I believe so.
[4110.78 → 4112.06] I don't actually know.
[4112.12 → 4113.10] I know NZXT is.
[4113.14 → 4115.16] I don't know that Height is.
[4115.52 → 4116.02] Well, okay.
[4116.04 → 4116.68] I think they are.
[4116.90 → 4117.96] NZXT isn't.
[4118.40 → 4118.96] But...
[4118.96 → 4120.02] Anyway.
[4121.78 → 4122.84] Okay, what's going on?
[4122.88 → 4123.74] Special SoCal.
[4124.12 → 4124.84] Tower of Power.
[4125.02 → 4129.34] On Height's support website, it says that Height is the sister brand of burrower.
[4129.52 → 4130.26] Okay, there you go.
[4130.84 → 4131.82] Okay, Tower of Power.
[4131.94 → 4136.44] So they're doing like motherboard tower build things, PC speed builds.
[4138.52 → 4139.76] Race Jay's car.
[4140.56 → 4142.28] Buy nothing trade-in booths.
[4142.28 → 4143.16] That's pretty cool.
[4143.96 → 4144.72] Oh, and the sim.
[4144.82 → 4145.06] Okay.
[4145.06 → 4148.28] I just heard you say Race Jay's car.
[4148.28 → 4150.18] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4150.18 → 4150.70] Yeah, there's a...
[4150.70 → 4152.34] They've got actually a bunch of great partners for this.
[4152.40 → 4154.36] Intel, AMD, Asus, Corsair, Pulsar.
[4154.36 → 4154.58] Sick.
[4154.98 → 4156.78] Hall of Tech, CyberPower PC.
[4157.02 → 4158.46] Oh, did we just...
[4158.46 → 4159.64] Lug fog Eventbrite?
[4159.70 → 4160.50] That doesn't make any sense.
[4160.62 → 4161.16] Did we what, sorry?
[4161.38 → 4162.74] Look, this is what...
[4162.74 → 4163.54] What is it?
[4163.54 → 4164.14] What did you do?
[4165.10 → 4166.22] What are you doing, Luke?
[4166.74 → 4167.40] What is that?
[4168.48 → 4170.40] I clicked on the link in the talk.
[4170.78 → 4171.42] Oh, uh-oh.
[4171.52 → 4172.24] Did we break it?
[4174.22 → 4174.82] Hold on.
[4174.82 → 4176.10] No, no, mine's still loading.
[4176.56 → 4176.86] Weird.
[4177.16 → 4180.04] Okay, well, anyway, if you're in Southern California...
[4180.04 → 4180.96] There we go, it loads now.
[4181.18 → 4183.90] Then, yeah, maybe check it out.
[4185.58 → 4186.86] I guess that's it.
[4186.90 → 4187.98] Our discussion question...
[4187.98 → 4189.22] Oh, who wrote this?
[4190.24 → 4191.42] Our discussion question is,
[4191.42 → 4192.86] when is LTX coming back?
[4193.56 → 4198.74] We don't have a plan to bring back LTX.
[4198.74 → 4203.34] Some people seem very confused about this fact,
[4203.52 → 4205.68] but LTX was never profitable.
[4206.16 → 4206.74] Oh, yeah.
[4206.82 → 4209.42] We were explicitly clear about it at every stage,
[4209.42 → 4210.48] but for some reason,
[4210.62 → 4212.16] some people are very stupid
[4212.16 → 4214.30] and can't figure out that...
[4214.30 → 4220.82] that means that we're not really profitable at it.
[4220.90 → 4221.94] There are things we could have done
[4221.94 → 4223.58] to make it more profitable, but...
[4223.58 → 4224.20] But we didn't do them.
[4224.30 → 4225.20] But we didn't.
[4225.24 → 4228.34] We spent a ton of money to make LTX what it was.
[4228.64 → 4228.82] Yeah.
[4228.82 → 4229.88] And at this point,
[4230.22 → 4232.84] unless we could make LTX what it was
[4232.84 → 4234.34] and what I wanted it to be,
[4234.40 → 4236.56] I don't really see the point of doing it.
[4237.24 → 4238.82] The last one was really cool.
[4239.20 → 4239.30] Yeah.
[4239.36 → 4239.82] It was a really...
[4239.82 → 4241.04] It was a high note to end up on.
[4241.12 → 4243.84] We had something like 60, 70 creators or something.
[4243.88 → 4245.08] I can't remember what the number was,
[4245.12 → 4246.62] but it was incredible.
[4246.86 → 4248.36] That group dinner was awesome.
[4248.46 → 4248.88] It was sweet.
[4249.24 → 4251.48] I'm probably including plus ones in that number.
[4251.58 → 4252.86] That's probably why that number didn't make any sense to you.
[4252.86 → 4254.96] I really liked the last LTX.
[4254.98 → 4255.84] Yeah, it was great.
[4256.26 → 4258.02] The one before that was pretty solid as well,
[4258.08 → 4259.86] but the last one was like kind of primo.
[4259.90 → 4260.82] Pretzel Parkour says,
[4260.90 → 4262.28] you said 2023 was profitable,
[4262.28 → 4263.86] but it put a huge strain on the team.
[4263.86 → 4266.94] It was profitable in terms of gross profit.
[4267.34 → 4269.50] It was not profitable in terms of net profit.
[4269.50 → 4272.14] Once we factor in all the time that we spent on it,
[4272.28 → 4274.86] it was a huge strain on the team, and it wasn't...
[4275.42 → 4276.96] A lot of different ways to measure that stuff.
[4277.08 → 4277.24] Yeah.
[4277.30 → 4279.62] What he's kind of talking about is like the writers
[4279.62 → 4283.20] needing to work potentially overtime and stuff
[4283.20 → 4284.48] in order to prep for LTX
[4284.48 → 4286.30] and make their videos leading up to it.
[4286.40 → 4287.64] Not just writers, logistics.
[4287.84 → 4289.24] That doesn't necessarily get factored
[4289.24 → 4290.46] into the direct cost of LTX.
[4290.46 → 4292.90] Creator warehouse, everyone.
[4292.90 → 4296.42] It was all hands on deck, and it just crushed us.
[4296.58 → 4300.94] And so if we can't make it what we envisioned it to be,
[4301.06 → 4304.98] then I'd rather that the last one just be,
[4305.64 → 4308.00] you know, it's swan song.
[4308.56 → 4309.54] With that said,
[4309.72 → 4313.52] I'm actually really excited about Whale Land.
[4313.84 → 4314.14] Yeah.
[4314.38 → 4315.54] Not the first one.
[4316.18 → 4319.00] Is that part of the dock this week?
[4319.14 → 4320.08] Okay, there it is.
[4320.08 → 4322.80] What the hell do you want to do at Whale?
[4322.92 → 4323.24] Okay.
[4323.36 → 4326.14] So we had our infrastructure test.
[4326.26 → 4327.32] Was that two weeks ago?
[4327.40 → 4327.86] A week ago?
[4328.10 → 4328.64] I can't remember.
[4328.90 → 4331.36] Time is an illusion that I do not look at.
[4331.50 → 4331.90] Okay.
[4332.00 → 4333.96] So we had our infrastructure test where we went,
[4334.02 → 4335.84] we wanted to make sure that all the networking
[4335.84 → 4336.90] and power was working.
[4337.08 → 4338.54] And thank goodness we did,
[4338.54 → 4343.46] because it turned out that three of our California standard 50 amp power plugs
[4343.46 → 4346.70] were just not hooked up at the breaker panel.
[4347.40 → 4348.80] Electricians told us it was hooked up.
[4349.00 → 4350.96] They ran the cables there.
[4351.40 → 4352.66] They just weren't in the breaker panel.
[4352.74 → 4354.26] It turned out that it was a bit of a
[4354.26 → 4355.20] a bit of a
[4355.28 → 4355.88] you take it,
[4355.88 → 4359.24] I got it situation with the lighting contractors
[4359.24 → 4361.96] who went and took those breaker spots.
[4362.16 → 4364.46] And then whoever was working on the
[4364.46 → 4365.88] the power plugs was like,
[4365.92 → 4366.04] oh,
[4366.06 → 4366.26] I mean,
[4366.26 → 4366.84] they're occupied.
[4367.12 → 4368.74] So someone else's job.
[4368.84 → 4369.24] See you later.
[4370.24 → 4372.80] Is my understanding of what happened.
[4372.94 → 4373.04] Who knows,
[4373.10 → 4373.74] but that makes sense.
[4373.80 → 4375.82] Not super happy with how that all went down.
[4375.82 → 4379.00] But the good thing about the contractors that we used for that building,
[4379.20 → 4379.36] the
[4379.36 → 4379.68] the
[4379.68 → 4383.84] the general contractor that we used for that building is that while they were very expensive,
[4383.84 → 4384.90] um,
[4385.28 → 4387.64] they are the kind that you follow up with,
[4387.64 → 4387.96] you know,
[4387.98 → 4388.66] six months,
[4388.94 → 4389.26] uh,
[4389.26 → 4390.52] nine months after completion.
[4390.74 → 4395.52] And they actually mostly return your calls and try to deal with things.
[4395.52 → 4397.78] So my understanding is that it is being dealt with.
[4397.78 → 4400.00] So I appreciate that.
[4400.08 → 4401.36] I wish it didn't happen in the first place,
[4401.36 → 4404.82] but I appreciate that it's mostly being dealt with.
[4404.82 → 4405.66] Um,
[4405.68 → 4406.00] anyway,
[4406.00 → 4408.28] so it's a perfect thing that we did that test.
[4408.70 → 4408.96] Um,
[4408.96 → 4414.26] and it's also a perfect thing that we brought a bunch of gamers out to do that test,
[4414.26 → 4422.42] because I think that whale land has a bit of an identity crisis right now.
[4422.90 → 4423.38] Um,
[4423.66 → 4423.92] you know,
[4423.98 → 4427.34] I think Luke and I approached it as like,
[4427.34 → 4432.50] I remember getting together with friends and playing video games and those being treasured memories.
[4432.50 → 4435.76] And the most obvious way to do that is,
[4435.88 → 4435.98] you know,
[4435.98 → 4436.82] like a BYOC,
[4437.12 → 4437.90] bring your own computer.
[4438.04 → 4439.04] You drag your rig out,
[4439.12 → 4439.86] all your peripherals.
[4439.86 → 4440.48] This is what we did.
[4440.58 → 4442.54] You set everything up for realistically,
[4442.76 → 4442.98] you know,
[4443.02 → 4445.82] an entire weekend of gaming and there's,
[4445.88 → 4446.14] you know,
[4446.38 → 4446.70] balls,
[4446.78 → 4448.00] energy drink and,
[4448.00 → 4449.18] and pizza takeout.
[4449.18 → 4449.64] And it's,
[4449.64 → 4450.10] and it's a
[4450.10 → 4451.10] and it's a whale of a time,
[4451.10 → 4451.32] right?
[4451.94 → 4452.34] Um,
[4452.60 → 4454.42] but what we kind of,
[4454.82 → 4455.62] or what at least,
[4455.72 → 4456.18] I don't know,
[4456.26 → 4457.22] I realized,
[4457.22 → 4457.58] and,
[4457.76 → 4459.80] and this was based on talking to other,
[4460.04 → 4463.32] it was staff and plus ones that we brought out for the infrastructure test.
[4463.70 → 4463.98] Um,
[4463.98 → 4465.08] talking to other people,
[4465.60 → 4466.12] um,
[4466.52 → 4466.90] what I,
[4467.02 → 4471.98] what I put together is that maybe BYOC is dead.
[4472.78 → 4474.56] And maybe that's okay.
[4475.36 → 4475.98] Might be.
[4476.24 → 4478.32] So hang with me here for a second,
[4478.32 → 4485.92] because it is pretty much a guarantee that the very first whale land will probably be basically a BYOC.
[4487.42 → 4490.98] But I have what I think is a
[4491.76 → 4492.18] um,
[4492.34 → 4492.60] okay.
[4492.66 → 4493.48] I've got people saying,
[4493.58 → 4493.68] no,
[4493.72 → 4494.04] it's not,
[4494.10 → 4494.46] but okay,
[4494.48 → 4494.94] here's my,
[4495.14 → 4496.34] wait for the explanation.
[4496.52 → 4496.88] Wait,
[4497.04 → 4497.44] wait.
[4497.56 → 4498.86] Because it's kind of cool.
[4498.86 → 4499.28] Okay.
[4499.42 → 4499.68] Wait,
[4499.72 → 4500.30] wait for a second,
[4500.30 → 4501.78] because it's not that they're dead.
[4501.78 → 4503.94] And it's not that they're boring, and it's not that they're bad,
[4503.94 → 4509.76] but what they are is suboptimal for every hour that you spend at a BYOC.
[4510.46 → 4511.26] What are the
[4511.64 → 4522.52] how many minutes of that do you think you are spending actually playing a game with people who are also there actively engaged?
[4523.26 → 4523.74] The
[4523.84 → 4524.04] the
[4524.04 → 4531.02] the game time density for experiences that we are dependent on being in the same room for is really,
[4531.02 → 4531.88] really low.
[4531.98 → 4532.46] And it's just,
[4532.52 → 4538.72] it's whether it's faffing about with updates or someone's mic not working or not being able to find the right discord or people,
[4538.72 → 4539.52] or someone,
[4539.88 → 4540.26] you know,
[4540.60 → 4542.88] not having the technical skills to,
[4542.96 → 4546.72] to go and get the totally legit copy of halo custom edition.
[4546.72 → 4549.06] that's on a server somewhere and get it installed.
[4549.06 → 4550.46] Like whatever it is,
[4550.48 → 4552.10] there's always something,
[4552.16 → 4553.96] there's always something delaying the game.
[4554.64 → 4558.48] And so what I was kind of thinking about is like,
[4558.54 → 4558.82] okay,
[4559.00 → 4561.66] how do we remove barriers?
[4561.66 → 4564.84] Because there are other barriers to like a lot of us are,
[4565.02 → 4565.60] you know,
[4566.54 → 4567.06] adults.
[4567.06 → 4568.06] adults.
[4568.06 → 4575.02] And the prospect of being completely engrossed in something for an entire weekend is not only not always possible,
[4575.02 → 4576.42] but it's not always even appealing.
[4577.02 → 4578.78] And adding to that,
[4578.84 → 4580.72] like I thought you lost something,
[4580.80 → 4581.00] right?
[4581.42 → 4581.60] Yeah.
[4581.66 → 4582.30] What did you lose?
[4582.52 → 4582.74] I forget.
[4583.10 → 4584.36] Power adapter for my monitor.
[4584.42 → 4584.76] There you go.
[4584.88 → 4585.16] Okay.
[4586.24 → 4587.82] Hauling all of your stuff somewhere.
[4587.82 → 4589.52] Like the way people set up their stations,
[4589.98 → 4591.66] their battle stations these days,
[4592.02 → 4593.18] tearing the whole thing down,
[4593.28 → 4593.98] taking it somewhere,
[4594.12 → 4594.96] setting it all up,
[4595.22 → 4596.96] tearing it back down and carrying it somewhere.
[4597.32 → 4598.46] Not always appealing.
[4598.76 → 4604.00] Now I do think that there's going to be a place for like a BYOC.
[4604.00 → 4605.86] If you're the kind of person who like really,
[4606.02 → 4606.22] really,
[4606.36 → 4606.60] really,
[4606.68 → 4607.18] really,
[4607.32 → 4607.50] really,
[4607.58 → 4610.92] really wants to bring your own rig and just like kind of talk about it and hang
[4610.92 → 4611.06] out.
[4611.34 → 4614.04] I think it's possible that a BYOC could carry on forever,
[4614.04 → 4615.82] but over time,
[4615.82 → 4619.62] what I would like to see happen is that Whale Land goes from,
[4620.00 → 4620.20] you know,
[4620.24 → 4625.66] being 90% BYOC and 10% what I'm about to describe to being more like 90% what
[4625.66 → 4628.64] I'm about to describe and 10% BYOC.
[4628.80 → 4631.86] Because what I realized is that when you,
[4631.96 → 4633.14] when you go by like a
[4633.20 → 4633.52] like a
[4633.52 → 4634.24] like a gaming,
[4634.52 → 4634.84] like a
[4634.84 → 4636.90] like an cafe kind of,
[4636.96 → 4637.18] you know,
[4637.22 → 4639.66] thing in an airport or on a street or whatever,
[4640.04 → 4642.40] you'll have like a group of bros that are in there,
[4642.40 → 4642.68] like,
[4642.74 → 4642.94] you know,
[4642.96 → 4644.16] playing their own thing.
[4644.48 → 4645.36] A lot of the time,
[4645.36 → 4647.34] they're not interacting with other people in the space.
[4647.34 → 4648.20] And a lot of the time,
[4648.26 → 4649.14] those spaces are dead.
[4649.52 → 4651.08] I went to this arcade in Singapore.
[4651.08 → 4653.44] That was shockingly expensive.
[4653.44 → 4657.46] Like I'm talking $3.50 a play on like see ball.
[4658.12 → 4658.60] No,
[4658.74 → 4660.74] like shockingly expensive.
[4661.12 → 4662.08] Now in fairness,
[4662.08 → 4663.16] it was raining that day,
[4663.16 → 4666.24] but this place was packed,
[4666.42 → 4667.64] packed.
[4667.78 → 4668.78] You could barely move.
[4668.92 → 4670.48] It was wild.
[4670.48 → 4671.94] And I'm sitting there going,
[4672.08 → 4673.22] I have fun at Castle Fun Park.
[4673.38 → 4678.90] So what does the arcade have that the cafe doesn't,
[4679.16 → 4681.32] or that the BYOC doesn't?
[4681.60 → 4682.52] And everyone in the arcade,
[4682.66 → 4683.12] they're gaming.
[4683.80 → 4684.46] They're gaming,
[4684.60 → 4685.84] or they're in line to game.
[4686.12 → 4686.62] They're gaming.
[4686.80 → 4687.50] They're engaged.
[4687.88 → 4689.96] And it was low friction.
[4690.52 → 4692.92] You don't need to bring all your crap to an arcade.
[4693.38 → 4697.14] You don't need to configure your graphic settings for an arcade.
[4697.14 → 4698.96] You don't need to install the games for an arcade.
[4698.96 → 4700.34] As limiting as this might sound,
[4700.48 → 4702.50] the games are also semi-decided for you.
[4702.78 → 4704.88] There's a smorgasbord of them.
[4705.04 → 4706.48] You can decide amongst the subset,
[4706.74 → 4707.48] but it's not,
[4707.64 → 4707.74] oh,
[4707.80 → 4709.52] the 700 games in my Steam list,
[4710.44 → 4712.56] which include a bunch of single player games that I'm playing in a LAN
[4712.56 → 4713.06] for some reason.
[4713.76 → 4714.78] It also,
[4715.54 → 4716.96] it's fixed.
[4717.78 → 4718.04] Yeah.
[4718.22 → 4719.22] This is the
[4719.22 → 4719.58] you know,
[4719.66 → 4721.14] the ski ball machine or whatever.
[4721.34 → 4722.70] This is the air hockey table.
[4722.82 → 4725.90] And we've talked a lot about how we would want to like,
[4725.90 → 4728.92] we want to like to enforce that when it's time to play this game,
[4728.98 → 4731.54] everyone's going to play this game, and we're going to be like,
[4731.60 → 4732.46] that's what we're doing.
[4732.62 → 4733.34] But at the end of the day,
[4733.34 → 4733.86] you can't do that.
[4733.94 → 4737.20] Even you were a pain in the butt when we were trying to get everybody
[4737.20 → 4739.42] separated into teams and left for dead,
[4739.46 → 4742.00] because you're sitting there playing like slay the spire or something
[4742.00 → 4744.56] with left for dead minimized in the background.
[4744.62 → 4745.74] They're not paying attention to calm.
[4745.82 → 4748.88] It's my best run I've ever had because really I set a record.
[4749.22 → 4749.38] Oh,
[4749.44 → 4749.66] nice.
[4749.80 → 4749.98] Yeah.
[4749.98 → 4750.24] Thanks.
[4750.58 → 4751.62] It was like actually sick.
[4751.62 → 4752.50] Don't do that man.
[4752.62 → 4752.90] We're trying,
[4752.96 → 4753.86] we're trying to play left for dead.
[4753.86 → 4757.36] The only thing I did was I didn't select my little icon fast enough.
[4758.00 → 4758.36] Anyway,
[4758.48 → 4759.52] the point is that,
[4759.60 → 4759.66] well,
[4759.70 → 4761.54] we couldn't start the game and that's the problem.
[4761.76 → 4761.98] We could,
[4762.20 → 4762.48] we could,
[4762.56 → 4763.86] I was not the reason we couldn't start the game.
[4764.04 → 4765.98] I was not the last player selected.
[4767.02 → 4767.38] So,
[4767.64 → 4770.34] so the point is that by,
[4770.72 → 4773.34] by having their own computers there,
[4773.62 → 4774.92] you introduce a lot of distraction.
[4775.08 → 4775.20] Yeah.
[4775.26 → 4776.22] And we talked about like,
[4776.28 → 4776.44] oh,
[4776.44 → 4779.54] we could like block social media on the network, and we can do this,
[4779.62 → 4779.96] we can do that.
[4779.96 → 4781.12] But at the end of the day,
[4781.56 → 4783.04] that's going to this,
[4783.12 → 4783.72] then you're,
[4783.72 → 4783.76] you're,
[4783.76 → 4786.38] you're kind of pleasing no one because the people,
[4786.38 → 4794.10] the people who want the arcade experience where everyone just goes to a station and plays a game are going to be disappointed because like,
[4794.84 → 4795.84] why aren't we gaming right now?
[4796.00 → 4797.20] Are you playing World of Warcraft?
[4797.32 → 4797.64] Like what,
[4797.76 → 4798.56] what are you even doing?
[4798.60 → 4800.44] You're not even playing with any of the other people who are here.
[4800.50 → 4801.36] What are you doing right now?
[4801.62 → 4801.86] Right?
[4802.02 → 4803.34] So those people are going to be disappointed.
[4803.34 → 4806.54] And the BYOC people who really are more about what,
[4806.60 → 4807.08] what's it called?
[4807.16 → 4807.84] Like co-play,
[4808.04 → 4811.40] I think co-play child development.
[4812.32 → 4812.84] Hold on.
[4812.86 → 4813.88] I think it's called co-play.
[4814.24 → 4814.78] I don't know what you're talking about.
[4814.80 → 4816.44] Typically cooperative play,
[4816.56 → 4817.26] typically emerging.
[4817.80 → 4817.98] Is it?
[4818.02 → 4818.16] No,
[4818.20 → 4818.32] no,
[4818.32 → 4818.44] no.
[4818.44 → 4819.18] It's called something else.
[4819.26 → 4820.16] But basically it's a
[4820.22 → 4820.80] it's a
[4820.80 → 4823.84] it's a thing where we're like parallel play.
[4823.94 → 4825.48] That's the one where I boys.
[4825.64 → 4826.00] Yeah.
[4826.00 → 4827.86] Where a bunch of kids are doing something.
[4828.06 → 4831.82] And the one kid that like doesn't really have the social skills yet,
[4831.96 → 4832.64] probably to,
[4832.70 → 4836.14] to integrate with the group will be like playing alongside them,
[4836.56 → 4838.22] often doing something completely different.
[4838.22 → 4839.66] And we'll go home and tell mom,
[4839.76 → 4839.90] you know,
[4839.98 → 4840.62] Oh yeah,
[4840.70 → 4843.16] me and Jenny did this and me and Sarah did that.
[4843.20 → 4843.66] And we did that.
[4843.66 → 4845.92] But actually they like never talked to Jenny or Sarah.
[4845.92 → 4846.48] They were just like,
[4846.52 → 4847.02] they were there.
[4847.14 → 4847.72] So yeah,
[4847.80 → 4848.40] parallel play,
[4848.46 → 4849.26] I believe is what it's,
[4849.36 → 4849.84] what it's called.
[4850.50 → 4850.86] Um,
[4851.72 → 4854.86] and so for a lot of BYOC people,
[4854.86 → 4855.88] that is the appeal.
[4856.14 → 4857.84] They're going, and they're parallel playing.
[4858.10 → 4860.48] They feel engaged with what's going on.
[4860.80 → 4861.20] Um,
[4861.22 → 4864.50] but they don't actually want to play video games other than that one game that
[4864.50 → 4865.20] they like to play.
[4865.20 → 4868.30] And they don't actually want to talk to anybody other than that one person
[4868.30 → 4869.10] they'd like to talk to.
[4869.28 → 4870.56] And that's valid,
[4870.56 → 4874.46] but that's not what this event is trying to be.
[4874.46 → 4874.82] Yeah.
[4875.34 → 4875.78] Um,
[4876.04 → 4876.30] and,
[4876.30 → 4881.60] and you could go back to old WAN shows pre any whale land and hear us talk
[4881.60 → 4883.82] about how that wasn't what this event was supposed to be.
[4883.94 → 4886.66] So this event was never supposed to be that from the start.
[4887.10 → 4889.18] That's why we had,
[4889.28 → 4890.00] uh,
[4890.00 → 4892.08] like at the test that we just did,
[4892.08 → 4895.36] there was sectioned periods of time when people were supposed to be all
[4895.36 → 4896.08] doing one thing.
[4896.08 → 4899.80] And even then the enforcement is clearly impossible.
[4899.80 → 4900.34] Yeah.
[4900.44 → 4901.84] We couldn't really do it.
[4901.92 → 4903.44] Teams were falling apart left and right.
[4903.52 → 4904.68] We tried to do a Valorant tournament.
[4905.06 → 4905.22] Oh,
[4905.30 → 4906.68] that was a disaster round.
[4906.84 → 4908.62] We had people leaving by the end.
[4908.62 → 4916.18] My team made the finals simply by merit of our entire five-person squad being in the match.
[4916.66 → 4918.96] Because it was five on three in the semis.
[4919.18 → 4919.38] Yeah.
[4919.50 → 4920.76] Because two people just like bailed.
[4920.80 → 4922.84] And this is with staff and plus ones.
[4923.00 → 4923.20] Yeah.
[4923.20 → 4924.32] When we've got random,
[4924.32 → 4926.48] it will be impossible to wrangle anyone.
[4927.14 → 4930.98] So here's a new concept for whale land.
[4931.64 → 4932.84] You don't bring anything.
[4933.24 → 4939.26] You bring yourself and a ticket, and we make the gaming experiences.
[4939.26 → 4941.76] So we've got some ideas,
[4941.76 → 4942.48] uh,
[4942.48 → 4943.14] include like,
[4943.24 → 4943.32] uh,
[4943.32 → 4943.46] you know,
[4943.50 → 4944.24] a pinball corner,
[4944.38 → 4944.60] you know,
[4944.80 → 4945.10] I,
[4945.16 → 4946.22] I bought a pinball machine.
[4946.22 → 4948.40] I put it in the lounge upstairs at smash champs.
[4948.48 → 4948.86] Um,
[4948.98 → 4949.20] I,
[4949.34 → 4950.08] I think,
[4950.38 → 4952.02] I think we have a contact at Stern now.
[4952.18 → 4952.58] Oh really?
[4952.70 → 4953.14] And yeah,
[4953.14 → 4954.60] I think they might be sending over like,
[4954.80 → 4955.22] uh,
[4955.22 → 4956.24] something for short circuit.
[4956.24 → 4957.28] Stern machines are nice.
[4957.28 → 4957.90] Oh my gosh,
[4958.14 → 4958.56] dude.
[4958.80 → 4959.60] They're really nice.
[4959.60 → 4959.86] Dude,
[4960.12 → 4960.34] dude,
[4960.42 → 4960.92] dude,
[4961.04 → 4961.40] love it.
[4961.50 → 4961.76] Anyway.
[4962.26 → 4962.62] Um,
[4962.98 → 4963.24] so,
[4963.38 → 4963.58] you know,
[4963.76 → 4965.78] pinball corner and just by,
[4965.86 → 4967.90] by merit of having a ticket to whale land,
[4968.08 → 4968.80] you can go play pinball.
[4968.80 → 4969.22] You just go in,
[4969.26 → 4969.76] you just play,
[4969.98 → 4970.40] which is fun.
[4970.48 → 4972.46] You'll obviously have to not be a dick and like,
[4972.50 → 4972.66] you know,
[4972.68 → 4974.30] move out of the way if someone else needs a turn,
[4974.34 → 4975.98] but there's no like popping quarters into it.
[4976.00 → 4976.12] It's,
[4976.18 → 4976.88] it's all you can eat.
[4976.90 → 4978.26] It's like the palladium model.
[4978.42 → 4979.80] There was an arcade at,
[4979.88 → 4980.12] uh,
[4980.12 → 4980.38] at a
[4980.42 → 4982.88] at a big mall here that unfortunately shut down,
[4982.92 → 4983.14] I guess,
[4983.18 → 4984.10] because it wasn't sustainable.
[4984.24 → 4984.54] Fortunately,
[4984.54 → 4987.52] I don't care because these are not about like making a ton of money.
[4987.52 → 4990.12] They're about having fun and me wanting to play video games.
[4990.56 → 4990.82] Um,
[4990.82 → 4991.22] but anyway,
[4991.22 → 4992.58] their model was all you can eat.
[4992.70 → 4993.50] So you just buy a pass,
[4993.56 → 4993.90] you go in,
[4993.94 → 4994.78] you play any game you want,
[4994.82 → 4995.94] you just swipe it.
[4995.98 → 4997.10] And I think it was just for tracking,
[4997.10 → 5001.32] like which games people are playing because he didn't pay any extra except for some of the like premium games.
[5001.60 → 5001.96] Anyway,
[5002.08 → 5003.28] so like pinball corner,
[5003.58 → 5005.14] high-end racing sim setups.
[5005.56 → 5005.76] Um,
[5005.76 → 5006.40] these are just all,
[5006.46 → 5008.66] these are ideas that are in the dock right now,
[5008.66 → 5009.46] but you could,
[5009.56 → 5010.58] you could put the truck,
[5011.22 → 5012.06] the truck driving.
[5012.74 → 5013.50] And that's,
[5013.58 → 5020.14] that's a big part of it is we build so many cool gaming experiences around here that then we just tear down.
[5020.52 → 5021.58] And there are things like,
[5021.58 → 5024.16] what to do with them that no one would be able to experience.
[5024.48 → 5024.82] Like I,
[5025.46 → 5025.60] yeah,
[5025.70 → 5026.68] here's a big one.
[5027.10 → 5029.96] Have you ever wanted to play Star Trek bridge crew?
[5030.36 → 5030.72] Yeah.
[5031.08 → 5032.06] Have you ever played it?
[5032.28 → 5032.54] No,
[5032.88 → 5033.34] me neither.
[5034.04 → 5037.26] I haven't played like whatever the old phone one is.
[5037.40 → 5037.86] I think I lied.
[5038.12 → 5041.30] I think I actually tried it very briefly once for a video.
[5041.76 → 5042.08] Um,
[5042.10 → 5042.62] but it's a
[5042.64 → 5043.72] it's a huge challenge.
[5043.84 → 5046.62] You need four people all with VR headsets.
[5046.62 → 5047.42] And it's like,
[5047.42 → 5050.28] when are those stars going to align?
[5051.46 → 5052.54] At whale land.
[5052.66 → 5053.10] That's pretty good.
[5053.26 → 5053.96] We could have a
[5054.04 → 5055.72] we could have a bridge crew set up.
[5055.72 → 5056.58] And,
[5056.58 → 5057.30] uh,
[5057.30 → 5057.74] so here,
[5057.82 → 5058.54] what else we've got?
[5058.94 → 5059.34] Um,
[5060.38 → 5060.86] Oh my God,
[5060.92 → 5061.12] Jake.
[5062.40 → 5064.52] He says a huge RGB fan,
[5064.74 → 5065.70] like three feet.
[5065.82 → 5068.30] And maybe we could cool a computer and make a video about it.
[5068.38 → 5069.60] It's writer's meeting today.
[5069.64 → 5069.96] I told him,
[5069.98 → 5071.66] I don't think it's a video worthy.
[5071.66 → 5071.94] Anyway,
[5071.94 → 5073.72] the point is we'd have somewhere,
[5073.86 → 5080.26] we'd have somewhere to graveyard those projects where people could enjoy them.
[5080.38 → 5080.56] Yeah,
[5080.60 → 5081.08] that'd be sweet.
[5081.30 → 5081.62] Um,
[5081.68 → 5081.90] you know,
[5081.92 → 5084.48] you could even have like something that's closer to an exhibit,
[5084.62 → 5085.90] like a state of VR test station.
[5085.98 → 5086.10] Dude,
[5086.24 → 5087.16] I would love that.
[5087.34 → 5090.22] There's a VR game that I love that just,
[5090.46 → 5090.58] it,
[5090.68 → 5092.54] the stars never aligned to play it.
[5092.58 → 5093.94] It's called take links house party.
[5094.02 → 5094.12] Oh,
[5094.12 → 5094.78] it's so sick.
[5094.90 → 5095.52] He's played it.
[5095.52 → 5095.80] Yeah.
[5095.96 → 5100.28] You have one VR headset player and everyone takes turns being the VR headset player.
[5100.38 → 5100.80] You're Hal.
[5101.06 → 5101.56] You're a home.
[5101.64 → 5102.98] You're a poor homeowner.
[5102.98 → 5106.86] Who's just trying to handle the take links infestation in your house.
[5107.24 → 5111.82] Everyone else sits around the TV with controllers, and they're the take links.
[5112.06 → 5117.32] And it's a kind of competitive,
[5117.32 → 5118.28] uh,
[5118.28 → 5122.48] sort of dynamic between the take links because they are all against Hal.
[5122.80 → 5123.80] They all agree on that,
[5123.92 → 5124.98] but they're competing against each other,
[5124.98 → 5127.20] but they also want to be the most against Hal.
[5127.64 → 5128.70] It's really,
[5129.02 → 5129.70] really fun.
[5129.82 → 5130.20] It's very fun.
[5130.34 → 5131.40] And you need like,
[5131.72 → 5132.36] realistically,
[5133.30 → 5135.94] if you don't have six plus take links,
[5136.10 → 5136.26] it's,
[5136.42 → 5138.30] it's too easy for Hal.
[5138.78 → 5140.02] You need chaos.
[5140.28 → 5141.14] And the more take links,
[5141.24 → 5141.98] the more chaos.
[5142.36 → 5143.76] And I think that station,
[5144.00 → 5145.16] fun when it's hard for Hal.
[5145.30 → 5145.52] Yeah.
[5145.52 → 5148.56] That station would be an absolute bluff.
[5148.76 → 5150.64] I'd love state of VR because I mean,
[5150.72 → 5151.84] most people have tried what,
[5151.94 → 5152.86] like a quest,
[5153.10 → 5154.18] I'm assuming at this point.
[5154.18 → 5155.10] Um,
[5155.10 → 5157.14] and if you could show people like,
[5157.80 → 5158.08] you know,
[5158.16 → 5159.88] big screen beyonds and stuff like that,
[5160.10 → 5161.10] it would just be really cool.
[5161.24 → 5161.44] Yeah.
[5161.48 → 5163.42] So immersive history of gaming exhibits.
[5163.52 → 5165.24] We could have like older games you could play.
[5165.36 → 5167.24] So a decent amount of the exhibits that were at.
[5168.00 → 5168.40] LTD.
[5168.56 → 5168.88] Yep.
[5169.34 → 5170.38] A gaming trivia corner,
[5170.50 → 5171.28] gaming jeopardy,
[5171.40 → 5172.22] human keyboard.
[5172.48 → 5172.80] Uh,
[5172.80 → 5173.28] people could,
[5173.28 → 5173.52] Oh,
[5173.62 → 5174.00] okay.
[5174.06 → 5174.20] Yeah.
[5174.20 → 5175.40] I don't know if we're ever going to end up doing that.
[5175.46 → 5175.60] Okay.
[5175.72 → 5177.94] So the writers have dumped a lot of projects.
[5178.22 → 5178.60] Read the
[5178.68 → 5179.32] read the last one.
[5179.36 → 5179.86] I wonder who,
[5180.00 → 5180.82] I wonder who said this.
[5180.90 → 5182.40] The Red Bull chug jug.
[5183.50 → 5186.52] Drink from an 1800 gallon jug of Red Bull.
[5186.62 → 5189.12] Whoever can drink the most wins the rest of the jug.
[5189.72 → 5190.08] No.
[5190.20 → 5190.38] Yes.
[5190.38 → 5191.10] We're not doing that.
[5191.18 → 5193.64] Cause call your mom and dad.
[5193.70 → 5194.60] What are these ideas?
[5194.70 → 5194.90] Okay.
[5200.84 → 5201.24] Okay.
[5201.24 → 5205.12] So my writing team is a bunch of nerds.
[5205.12 → 5205.58] Oh man.
[5205.90 → 5206.34] Um,
[5206.66 → 5208.14] gamer rage room.
[5208.40 → 5210.08] Your team kept feeding on match.
[5210.22 → 5212.14] So your hard carry never came online.
[5212.32 → 5214.96] Smash e-waste in a room to help process everything.
[5215.28 → 5215.62] Okay.
[5215.82 → 5216.58] The point is,
[5216.86 → 5217.00] call your mom,
[5217.08 → 5217.16] dad.
[5217.22 → 5218.62] We can just bring the Tuesday pod.
[5219.50 → 5219.90] Just like,
[5220.00 → 5220.18] yeah,
[5220.18 → 5222.62] the point is the point is that,
[5222.62 → 5223.38] um,
[5223.42 → 5223.60] and,
[5223.66 → 5224.38] and I think we could,
[5224.46 → 5227.36] there is a lot of room for just still PC gaming.
[5227.86 → 5230.66] Like I would absolutely want to have an eight V eight,
[5231.22 → 5232.72] all the systems facing each other,
[5232.82 → 5234.66] red versus blue halo station.
[5234.66 → 5234.78] Yeah.
[5234.78 → 5235.46] And we do,
[5235.46 → 5235.66] you know,
[5235.76 → 5236.80] playing left for dead would be great.
[5236.96 → 5239.58] I still would love to do savage at some point.
[5239.68 → 5240.16] Oh dude.
[5240.26 → 5240.40] Yeah.
[5240.40 → 5242.28] It's like a 64 versus 64,
[5242.28 → 5243.16] uh,
[5243.22 → 5245.22] RTS slash FPS.
[5245.54 → 5246.92] One RTS player per team.
[5247.00 → 5247.92] Everyone else is FPS.
[5248.62 → 5249.06] Um,
[5249.06 → 5253.88] so there's still room for us to have a ton of like traditional PC gaming.
[5253.88 → 5257.34] Like I'd love to have like a worms Armageddon station where it's just like,
[5257.72 → 5257.92] like,
[5257.96 → 5260.94] it'd be kind of cool to have it in like a hexagon,
[5261.10 → 5263.04] except the chairs are on the inside.
[5263.04 → 5264.66] So,
[5264.86 → 5265.48] so you're,
[5265.48 → 5266.36] so you're,
[5266.46 → 5267.30] so you can like,
[5267.76 → 5269.00] so you can like to lean over me like,
[5269.06 → 5269.28] ah,
[5269.32 → 5269.70] I got them,
[5269.76 → 5269.92] you know,
[5269.92 → 5270.10] like,
[5270.34 → 5271.74] cause that's what was missing.
[5272.08 → 5272.80] It sounds like one of the worms.
[5273.06 → 5273.92] A lot of people,
[5274.14 → 5277.22] a lot of people who attended the tech test were like,
[5277.28 → 5277.66] actually,
[5277.74 → 5277.90] you know,
[5277.92 → 5279.24] I had more fun at the land at your house.
[5279.76 → 5279.96] Yeah,
[5279.98 → 5280.32] I did.
[5280.42 → 5283.82] Because we did a couple lands at my house, and I was trying to figure out why,
[5283.82 → 5286.26] because all the same people were there,
[5286.36 → 5287.82] all the same computers were there.
[5288.06 → 5289.22] So what was the difference?
[5289.24 → 5289.72] And it was,
[5289.82 → 5291.08] it was actually the
[5291.08 → 5292.26] the potted off.
[5292.58 → 5292.80] Yeah.
[5293.52 → 5293.92] Isolation.
[5294.10 → 5295.32] Cause like I was in the garage,
[5295.40 → 5298.12] I think both times and the garage ended up playing together.
[5298.42 → 5298.70] Yeah.
[5298.92 → 5302.58] And I was in the theatre room a lot of the time just playing on the big screen.
[5302.74 → 5302.92] Yeah.
[5303.02 → 5306.58] And then there was a crew that was at my house till like five in the morning
[5306.58 → 5309.14] playing Jack box games on the rec room TV.
[5309.28 → 5315.10] And so that was what was missing was giving people space to get immersed.
[5315.44 → 5316.32] It's easier to,
[5316.52 → 5316.70] when,
[5316.78 → 5319.44] when you and I were sitting in the back row trying to yell at people to come
[5319.44 → 5320.70] play whatever game we were playing,
[5321.02 → 5321.80] it wasn't that effective.
[5322.02 → 5322.24] Yeah.
[5322.24 → 5324.50] When you're in the garage and there's only eight of you.
[5324.74 → 5325.16] That's it.
[5325.28 → 5327.06] Pretty easy to get people on board.
[5327.30 → 5327.70] Exactly.
[5328.12 → 5328.24] Um,
[5328.30 → 5329.40] it's very different.
[5329.90 → 5330.74] Sometimes it's useful.
[5330.86 → 5332.42] Sometimes it's used for good.
[5332.56 → 5334.10] I think there can also be like,
[5334.62 → 5336.88] like one of the ideas I think I came up with,
[5336.94 → 5337.16] I don't know,
[5337.18 → 5337.52] maybe you did.
[5337.58 → 5337.94] I don't remember.
[5338.28 → 5338.70] Um,
[5338.76 → 5339.56] but the
[5339.78 → 5343.50] we could have like a Super Mario Bros station and that was your idea.
[5343.62 → 5344.16] You could,
[5344.28 → 5344.80] you could,
[5344.94 → 5345.58] it just,
[5345.72 → 5345.96] you know,
[5345.96 → 5348.36] it's just sitting there on the first level at the beginning of the land.
[5348.66 → 5351.78] And the idea is if like by Friday night,
[5351.78 → 5352.52] let's say it's a Friday,
[5352.66 → 5353.66] Saturday land by,
[5353.82 → 5355.16] by Friday night at midnight,
[5355.16 → 5357.40] if all 96 exits,
[5357.40 → 5358.50] if it's beat,
[5358.86 → 5360.02] if they have beat the game,
[5360.08 → 5361.02] you collectively,
[5361.22 → 5361.66] the land,
[5361.74 → 5363.16] if the land has beat the game,
[5363.22 → 5366.34] then like Linus orders pizza for everyone or something.
[5366.34 → 5373.22] And you structure it where like the budget to order pizza was in the ticket cost.
[5373.22 → 5373.46] Yeah.
[5373.56 → 5374.64] We better assume we're doing it.
[5374.64 → 5375.90] We're expecting to buy it,
[5375.94 → 5376.16] you know,
[5376.18 → 5377.22] but you give them a mission.
[5377.34 → 5379.40] You give them something to chase because that sounds fun.
[5379.40 → 5381.58] And somebody is going to walk in and see that and be like,
[5381.64 → 5382.38] this is me.
[5382.76 → 5383.94] I will do this.
[5383.94 → 5385.90] And now they have like a mission, and they accomplish it.
[5385.90 → 5388.18] And now they like earned pizza for the land.
[5388.24 → 5389.52] So they feel all stoked about it.
[5389.88 → 5390.66] And like you,
[5390.66 → 5392.94] you create these like little bits of activation.
[5393.16 → 5394.08] Now there are challenges.
[5394.60 → 5397.96] Obviously it's going to take a long time to execute on something like this.
[5397.96 → 5406.52] Like if we are literally rolling into the land with every computer and every console and every display and every,
[5406.52 → 5406.88] you know,
[5406.94 → 5410.50] pipe and drape isolator for VR base stations or,
[5410.50 → 5410.72] you know,
[5410.76 → 5411.22] whatever,
[5411.38 → 5411.54] right?
[5411.56 → 5414.28] Like if we're rolling in with absolutely everything that's needed,
[5414.28 → 5416.98] it's going to be tough.
[5419.28 → 5420.66] It'll take us time to build up to that.
[5420.72 → 5420.98] We could,
[5421.04 → 5422.24] we could do this piecemeal.
[5422.28 → 5424.66] Like we could add things over time,
[5424.72 → 5425.14] little bit,
[5425.20 → 5425.50] little bit,
[5425.56 → 5427.78] little bit as we build up to this whole thing.
[5428.10 → 5428.54] You know,
[5428.54 → 5431.88] we don't need 1800 gallon jug of Red Bull day one.
[5432.06 → 5432.34] Yeah.
[5432.76 → 5435.42] So we're going to scrappy DP asks,
[5435.50 → 5436.42] where are you storing all this gear?
[5436.44 → 5436.94] We got a plan.
[5437.40 → 5438.30] We got a plan.
[5438.30 → 5438.74] Um,
[5438.74 → 5446.72] that's actually a big part of what would enable this pivot is there was an unexpected plan for storing stuff,
[5446.72 → 5447.38] um,
[5447.38 → 5450.10] which will also help out smash champs in terms of,
[5450.10 → 5450.60] um,
[5450.64 → 5452.04] growing their retail shop,
[5452.04 → 5452.58] uh,
[5452.58 → 5452.90] presence.
[5453.08 → 5456.20] So for those of you not sort of up to speed,
[5456.20 → 5456.92] um,
[5456.92 → 5460.22] I bought a badminton centre a little while ago or more accurately.
[5460.22 → 5462.24] I bought a building and then,
[5462.24 → 5462.68] um,
[5462.68 → 5467.58] turned it into a badminton centre in Surrey, and it's actually going great,
[5467.58 → 5468.98] which is kind of surprising.
[5468.98 → 5472.26] I was expecting it to be a money losing endeavour forever.
[5472.84 → 5473.32] Um,
[5473.44 → 5477.02] and the retail store is like killing it.
[5477.60 → 5477.92] Uh,
[5477.94 → 5478.18] yeah,
[5478.26 → 5479.14] like it's,
[5479.14 → 5480.90] it's going unexpectedly well.
[5480.94 → 5482.86] I think we're over 200 premium members.
[5482.98 → 5486.88] So there is people have asked to be able to buy LTT store products.
[5486.88 → 5488.00] I know physically.
[5488.26 → 5488.66] Um,
[5488.76 → 5490.40] and there is LTT store products there.
[5490.46 → 5495.28] The logistics are extremely challenging for doing order pickup because it's not like part of,
[5495.28 → 5495.38] Oh,
[5495.40 → 5497.04] I don't mean that there's stuff on the shelf.
[5497.28 → 5497.42] Oh,
[5497.44 → 5497.68] I know.
[5497.84 → 5498.02] Yeah.
[5498.08 → 5498.56] Oh yeah.
[5498.56 → 5499.86] There are only a couple of things guys.
[5499.96 → 5502.98] It's like the athletic pants and some water bottles and stuff.
[5503.28 → 5503.96] Some stuff.
[5504.02 → 5505.64] It's not really set up.
[5505.88 → 5510.32] The LTT store has like hundreds of SKUs and the store is not set up for that.
[5510.36 → 5510.54] Anyway,
[5510.54 → 5512.96] the point is the retail store has been doing great.
[5512.96 → 5513.60] Not,
[5513.60 → 5514.26] uh,
[5514.46 → 5515.44] tall XLs,
[5515.44 → 5516.02] short sleeve.
[5516.16 → 5516.30] Yeah.
[5516.62 → 5517.16] It's a
[5517.22 → 5519.64] it's a real business all of a sudden,
[5519.76 → 5520.08] which I,
[5520.32 → 5521.74] which I wasn't really expecting.
[5521.98 → 5525.18] And so they kind of needed some extra space for,
[5525.18 → 5525.98] um,
[5526.26 → 5535.74] for like overflow inventory so that we can stock enough because the store itself was only ever supposed to be just like a storefront for like a handful of items just in case people forget it.
[5535.94 → 5539.06] But people are coming in like all the time.
[5539.06 → 5539.26] Like,
[5539.30 → 5539.40] Oh,
[5539.42 → 5539.64] I,
[5539.64 → 5540.22] I like,
[5540.60 → 5541.10] I don't know.
[5541.12 → 5541.68] Is this a store?
[5541.68 → 5541.90] Like,
[5541.94 → 5542.90] can I buy badminton shoes?
[5542.96 → 5543.22] And we're like,
[5543.30 → 5543.50] Oh,
[5543.56 → 5544.38] I guess.
[5544.48 → 5544.62] Sure.
[5544.74 → 5544.92] Like,
[5545.16 → 5545.90] it's like,
[5545.94 → 5546.54] it's kind of crazy.
[5546.72 → 5549.92] It is a relatively large and actually pretty nice store.
[5550.30 → 5550.50] Yeah.
[5550.50 → 5552.38] If you ignore the entire rest of it,
[5552.46 → 5553.68] like it's blowing my mind,
[5553.74 → 5553.88] man.
[5553.94 → 5554.16] It's,
[5554.26 → 5554.56] it's,
[5554.56 → 5555.52] it seems pretty clean.
[5555.60 → 5556.18] It's well lit.
[5556.28 → 5556.84] I also felt,
[5557.06 → 5558.42] I also felt pretty good when,
[5558.42 → 5558.72] uh,
[5558.72 → 5562.50] someone who works on like store flow layout and design came in and was like,
[5562.54 → 5562.62] Oh,
[5562.62 → 5570.54] this is like a perfect layout because you force everybody to walk through the retail store when they come in and walk through the retail store in concession.
[5570.54 → 5571.46] Exit through the gift shop.
[5571.72 → 5572.18] When they leave.
[5572.18 → 5572.94] Um,
[5573.22 → 5574.54] this is actually like perfect.
[5574.64 → 5576.12] Yvonne and I session going to be up.
[5577.08 → 5577.48] Uh,
[5577.58 → 5578.18] it's complicated.
[5578.26 → 5578.34] Oh,
[5578.34 → 5580.00] is there like licensing or something?
[5580.14 → 5580.54] So,
[5580.54 → 5581.38] um,
[5581.52 → 5582.08] there's a whole,
[5582.16 → 5584.70] there are certifications that you need in order to,
[5584.86 → 5587.34] in order to literally like to microwave a hot pocket.
[5587.34 → 5588.96] we have to have certifications.
[5588.96 → 5593.44] We have to have like two sinks that are separated for some purpose and some other purpose.
[5593.92 → 5594.28] Basically,
[5594.28 → 5599.44] we just like to put a small kitchen in it and assumed that our like general contractor would tell us if we hadn't like done it right.
[5599.44 → 5601.54] And we need a bunch more ventilation.
[5601.54 → 5602.50] We're going to do it.
[5602.84 → 5603.02] Um,
[5603.02 → 5603.98] I think we're going to,
[5604.06 → 5605.40] so when we pull permit for that,
[5605.52 → 5609.46] we're probably going to pull permit for adding some more showers at the back.
[5609.46 → 5611.92] And I think those will be premium member only showers.
[5611.92 → 5617.62] Cause right now there's only the one shower in each bathroom because most of the other badminton centres that I've played at,
[5617.68 → 5618.16] uh,
[5618.16 → 5619.76] all the players just like go home and shower.
[5619.76 → 5620.74] Um,
[5620.92 → 5622.86] and what people said to me was,
[5623.00 → 5623.12] well,
[5623.18 → 5623.44] yeah,
[5624.32 → 5625.66] if you've seen the state of those showers,
[5625.74 → 5626.50] wouldn't you do that?
[5626.52 → 5626.82] And I'm like,
[5626.86 → 5627.08] yeah,
[5627.20 → 5628.16] I don't shower there either.
[5628.16 → 5628.68] Because they're,
[5629.18 → 5629.46] uh,
[5629.76 → 5632.36] I don't want to name any names now that we're kind of competitors.
[5632.36 → 5639.26] So I've been in at least one badminton centre at one point where I didn't use the shower because I thought it was not something I would want to use.
[5639.40 → 5640.36] He's been in a lot of them.
[5640.36 → 5640.62] Yeah.
[5640.72 → 5641.48] And I've been in all of them.
[5641.72 → 5642.30] Genuinely doesn't narrow.
[5642.32 → 5642.50] Yeah.
[5642.50 → 5643.60] It does not narrow it down at all.
[5643.74 → 5646.40] I've been to like four different ones with him and that's,
[5646.62 → 5646.84] yeah.
[5646.96 → 5647.16] Yeah.
[5647.24 → 5648.70] The point is that,
[5648.70 → 5649.12] um,
[5649.12 → 5649.50] they were like,
[5649.54 → 5649.64] yeah,
[5649.64 → 5650.76] we'd use the showers here.
[5650.76 → 5651.22] And I was like,
[5651.24 → 5651.50] Oh,
[5651.98 → 5652.58] that makes sense.
[5652.82 → 5654.38] So we're probably going to add some more showers.
[5654.46 → 5655.76] So when we pull permit for,
[5655.76 → 5656.30] uh,
[5656.30 → 5656.84] the showers,
[5656.84 → 5657.78] we'll do the
[5657.78 → 5658.42] the
[5658.42 → 5658.70] um,
[5658.70 → 5659.78] concession at the same time.
[5659.78 → 5660.12] But,
[5660.26 → 5660.48] um,
[5661.04 → 5661.32] anyway,
[5661.32 → 5662.68] the point is we have a plan for storage.
[5663.18 → 5667.50] So that's what I would like to achieve.
[5667.56 → 5668.06] You should,
[5668.06 → 5676.00] you should add basic shower things to the store because the amount of times I go to the gym and people forgot their shower stuff is a lot.
[5676.38 → 5676.96] That's a good idea.
[5677.00 → 5677.46] Like little,
[5677.46 → 5678.26] like travel,
[5678.42 → 5679.44] little things of like,
[5679.44 → 5681.92] shampoo and body wash and maybe a loofah or whatever.
[5682.72 → 5683.06] Sure.
[5683.36 → 5684.22] I think it's a good idea.
[5684.34 → 5685.08] I think it's a good idea.
[5685.74 → 5686.14] Um,
[5686.56 → 5687.06] so yeah,
[5687.06 → 5690.70] if you guys have ideas for what you guys want to see at whale land,
[5690.78 → 5692.52] we are super open to them.
[5693.00 → 5693.40] Uh,
[5693.44 → 5693.84] please.
[5694.00 → 5694.30] Uh,
[5694.30 → 5695.02] how do people,
[5695.16 → 5696.18] how do people send this?
[5696.24 → 5696.58] You know what?
[5696.82 → 5697.24] Send what?
[5697.48 → 5697.60] Uh,
[5697.60 → 5698.66] like their ideas.
[5698.66 → 5700.52] Leave a comment on the YouTube upload.
[5700.52 → 5701.22] Does that work?
[5701.22 → 5702.44] You could make a forum thread.
[5702.76 → 5703.06] Oh yeah.
[5703.20 → 5703.36] Oh,
[5703.44 → 5703.90] we could make a
[5703.98 → 5704.22] Dan,
[5704.36 → 5707.38] do you have time to make a forum thread or are your fingers on fire still?
[5707.70 → 5708.66] Oh my God.
[5708.66 → 5709.72] Probably not at the moment,
[5709.98 → 5710.18] but,
[5710.32 → 5710.58] um,
[5710.58 → 5713.64] we could send that to a writer or something.
[5713.76 → 5720.72] I see a handful of you found the incredible ship storm sale event on LTT store.com where
[5720.72 → 5724.02] you can get free shipping on orders over 150 us dollars shop.
[5724.02 → 5726.48] Now we've got a great deal on the MCM essential solution,
[5726.84 → 5730.20] just 79 99 us dollars for all that cable management.
[5730.32 → 5731.04] Absolutely incredible.
[5731.24 → 5732.66] And you can also pick up a commuter backpack,
[5732.82 → 5733.68] precision multiple screwdriver.
[5733.88 → 5734.12] Uh,
[5734.12 → 5735.08] you could get a regular backpack,
[5735.22 → 5735.94] regular screwdriver,
[5736.12 → 5736.48] tech sack,
[5736.58 → 5737.46] offsite laptop bags,
[5737.54 → 5737.96] ride driver,
[5738.20 → 5740.10] any of these fantastic apparel items.
[5740.20 → 5740.80] Look at all of this.
[5740.86 → 5740.98] Oh,
[5741.04 → 5741.78] a floppy disk notebook.
[5741.90 → 5742.18] Look at that.
[5742.24 → 5742.74] 1499.
[5742.94 → 5744.06] You could add that to your cart right now.
[5745.12 → 5745.44] Boobies.
[5747.38 → 5748.92] You need me to do float plane announcements.
[5749.06 → 5749.24] Okay.
[5749.28 → 5749.78] I could do that.
[5749.88 → 5750.10] Is that,
[5750.20 → 5750.32] yeah,
[5750.38 → 5750.84] sure.
[5750.84 → 5751.16] Uh,
[5752.68 → 5753.60] secret shopper.
[5754.02 → 5754.30] Wait,
[5755.32 → 5757.26] are we allowed to talk about this?
[5757.84 → 5758.34] I guess.
[5758.48 → 5758.68] I mean,
[5758.70 → 5759.34] it's in the doc.
[5759.68 → 5760.66] Holy shit.
[5761.30 → 5763.26] Secret shopper is back.
[5763.50 → 5765.62] Are you fucking kidding me?
[5765.78 → 5767.52] Is secret shopper back?
[5768.84 → 5769.08] Uh,
[5769.14 → 5770.44] it is okay to talk about this.
[5770.64 → 5778.68] So we can never announce a new series of secret shopper until the
[5778.68 → 5779.14] uh,
[5779.14 → 5780.40] until the previous,
[5780.90 → 5783.96] or until we've gotten as far as completing the text,
[5783.96 → 5784.64] support challenge.
[5784.98 → 5787.02] Once we've completed our tech support calls,
[5787.14 → 5787.80] you can let it rip.
[5787.98 → 5788.38] Nothing.
[5788.48 → 5790.68] The participants can do anymore to,
[5790.82 → 5791.00] to,
[5791.12 → 5792.16] to change the outcome.
[5792.24 → 5793.64] So we have ordered the systems.
[5793.64 → 5795.94] We have unpacked the systems, and we have,
[5795.94 → 5796.84] um,
[5796.94 → 5800.78] created tech support challenges and contacted all the companies.
[5800.78 → 5802.20] Secret shopper is back.
[5802.20 → 5803.40] The theme this year is,
[5803.50 → 5803.70] you know what?
[5803.70 → 5804.56] I'm not going to spoil it.
[5804.86 → 5806.50] I am going to play.
[5806.84 → 5807.60] You have a cute,
[5807.66 → 5808.40] I have a cute up already.
[5808.52 → 5808.72] Okay.
[5808.74 → 5809.22] Who do you want?
[5810.60 → 5811.00] Dan?
[5811.18 → 5811.54] Surprise.
[5811.96 → 5812.12] Yeah.
[5812.28 → 5812.60] If,
[5812.66 → 5813.72] if you've got a cute Luke,
[5813.78 → 5814.34] go for it.
[5814.44 → 5814.60] Oh,
[5814.74 → 5815.02] okay.
[5815.08 → 5815.58] Luke lap.
[5817.28 → 5817.68] Okay.
[5817.92 → 5818.06] Oh,
[5818.70 → 5819.52] do they have audio?
[5819.96 → 5820.18] Yeah.
[5820.36 → 5820.58] Okay.
[5820.58 → 5820.84] Hold on.
[5820.84 → 5821.08] Go back,
[5821.12 → 5821.30] go back,
[5821.32 → 5821.50] go back.
[5821.58 → 5821.94] Start it over.
[5822.02 → 5822.88] So the theme this year,
[5822.96 → 5824.50] if you guys haven't figured it out yet,
[5826.02 → 5829.52] Lilac Holmes and his trusty partner,
[5829.68 → 5832.96] such a stretch.
[5837.28 → 5837.84] Gross.
[5841.34 → 5842.80] I thought that was me for a second.
[5851.94 → 5855.86] Oh wait,
[5855.92 → 5856.46] it looks like it's,
[5856.58 → 5856.96] I'm dead.
[5857.22 → 5857.64] It does.
[5864.42 → 5864.90] That's it.
[5864.96 → 5865.54] That's all we can show.
[5866.26 → 5866.66] Oh,
[5866.78 → 5868.26] it's going to be a good one,
[5868.30 → 5868.68] boys.
[5868.86 → 5869.72] That's fantastic.
[5870.64 → 5870.88] Man,
[5870.88 → 5872.18] that side profile shot of proof.
[5872.28 → 5873.28] I legit thought it was me.
[5873.46 → 5875.64] I actually kind of thought it was weird.
[5876.02 → 5876.30] I was like,
[5876.34 → 5877.46] I don't remember doing this.
[5878.18 → 5878.52] Wow.
[5878.90 → 5879.26] So,
[5879.38 → 5881.26] I'm really excited to,
[5881.26 → 5882.96] to get this started for you guys.
[5883.36 → 5884.98] There's a little more to that clip,
[5885.06 → 5886.12] but we'll leave it there.
[5886.28 → 5888.06] For those of you who haven't seen it before,
[5888.32 → 5891.04] Secret Shopper is a series where we anonymously purchase.
[5891.06 → 5891.18] Oh,
[5891.20 → 5891.60] I'm excited.
[5891.60 → 5895.58] Mid-range PCs from some of the top North American system integrators and
[5895.58 → 5897.74] evaluate them across a range of criteria.
[5898.20 → 5898.68] This year,
[5898.74 → 5900.22] we're going to be looking at burrower,
[5900.64 → 5901.08] Dell,
[5901.54 → 5901.94] HP,
[5902.28 → 5902.78] Main Gear,
[5903.02 → 5903.58] CyberPower,
[5903.78 → 5904.58] Origin PC,
[5905.02 → 5905.60] Lenovo,
[5905.76 → 5907.30] and Star Forge.
[5907.76 → 5909.18] This is a must-read,
[5909.30 → 5909.86] call to action,
[5909.96 → 5910.38] must read.
[5910.38 → 5915.74] The first episode drops April 17th on YouTube with new episodes every two weeks.
[5915.82 → 5916.18] However,
[5916.92 → 5921.00] Float plane subscribers get 48 hours before YouTube.
[5921.24 → 5921.30] So,
[5921.38 → 5924.32] if you want to be among the first to watch on April 15th,
[5924.38 → 5928.70] go to leg.GG slash float plane and get signed up.
[5928.80 → 5930.16] And the float plane train,
[5931.20 → 5931.76] float train,
[5932.46 → 5933.56] doesn't stop there.
[5934.08 → 5940.16] Sammy also visited Dennis's house to see how the purchases from his ultimate tech upgrade were holding up.
[5940.16 → 5942.42] Despite what many thought after watching his upgrade,
[5942.76 → 5944.44] he did not waste his money.
[5944.92 → 5945.42] With that said,
[5945.44 → 5946.70] he really needs to clean his PC.
[5946.88 → 5948.38] It has not been cleaned since then.
[5948.70 → 5948.92] Oh,
[5948.94 → 5950.78] and I'm apparently supposed to play this.
[5950.78 → 5952.98] Did the timestamp work?
[5953.14 → 5953.30] Oh,
[5953.30 → 5953.40] yeah,
[5953.40 → 5953.84] here we go.
[5953.84 → 5954.00] I don't know.
[5954.08 → 5954.64] I just can't.
[5956.14 → 5958.22] It's not my priority to clean this PC.
[5959.22 → 5959.62] Linus,
[5959.66 → 5960.54] I need help!
[5961.04 → 5961.36] Linus!
[5961.74 → 5962.12] Okay.
[5962.86 → 5963.26] Oh,
[5963.46 → 5964.00] whoa!
[5965.94 → 5966.34] Okay.
[5966.48 → 5966.90] That's very,
[5967.14 → 5968.36] that's pretty gross.
[5968.36 → 5969.00] Look at here.
[5969.38 → 5970.84] It's like a little beach down here.
[5971.22 → 5972.02] Look at that!
[5972.88 → 5973.40] Okay.
[5973.64 → 5973.86] Well,
[5973.98 → 5974.24] anyway,
[5974.46 → 5975.58] thank you for that,
[5975.66 → 5975.88] Dennis.
[5976.78 → 5978.74] A beach of dust is rough.
[5979.04 → 5980.42] It is also today,
[5980.64 → 5984.18] the last day to get merch created by the one and only,
[5984.54 → 5984.98] Sarah Butt,
[5985.90 → 5988.54] including the float plane exclusive,
[5989.32 → 5992.28] this is a dorky Dino design.
[5992.44 → 5992.86] It's great.
[5992.94 → 5993.06] Hold on,
[5993.10 → 5993.44] I have to move.
[5993.50 → 5994.02] There you go.
[5994.40 → 5994.68] That's all.
[5994.68 → 5996.76] I know,
[5996.88 → 5998.38] but I figured it out.
[5999.14 → 5999.50] Also,
[5999.70 → 6000.52] the content cosmos,
[6000.74 → 6001.16] art print,
[6001.40 → 6002.94] and streams with Sarah,
[6003.02 → 6004.26] art print number three.
[6007.22 → 6007.54] Okay.
[6007.80 → 6008.14] I mean,
[6008.18 → 6008.72] not this one.
[6009.74 → 6009.96] Okay.
[6011.58 → 6012.68] Until April 14th.
[6012.68 → 6012.80] Oh,
[6012.84 → 6012.94] no,
[6013.00 → 6013.74] that one is,
[6013.94 → 6014.66] what is this one?
[6014.68 → 6015.06] I forget.
[6015.34 → 6016.04] I think it's this,
[6017.40 → 6018.48] but in an art print,
[6018.58 → 6019.14] would it not be?
[6019.32 → 6019.84] I think so.
[6020.10 → 6020.26] Yeah,
[6020.40 → 6020.84] I think so.
[6021.16 → 6021.36] I'm not,
[6021.42 → 6021.84] I was uncertain,
[6021.92 → 6022.36] but I think so.
[6022.36 → 6022.58] Well,
[6022.70 → 6024.10] don't quote us on any of that.
[6024.68 → 6025.68] You could just order it
[6025.68 → 6026.36] and then see what you get.
[6026.98 → 6027.34] So,
[6027.48 → 6028.30] call to action,
[6028.38 → 6028.84] must read.
[6029.02 → 6030.12] This is the best time
[6030.12 → 6031.08] to get maximum value
[6031.08 → 6031.70] from float plane
[6031.70 → 6033.14] for as low as $5 a month.
[6033.28 → 6034.72] Subscribe at leg.GG
[6034.72 → 6036.20] slash float plane.
[6036.84 → 6037.36] All right,
[6037.38 → 6037.54] Dan,
[6037.56 → 6038.32] what are we supposed to be doing?
[6039.48 → 6039.96] Sponsors.
[6040.22 → 6041.26] Why don't we do one topic
[6041.26 → 6042.04] before we do sponsors?
[6043.32 → 6043.68] Okay.
[6043.92 → 6044.28] Sure.
[6044.88 → 6046.44] Why do you bother asking me?
[6047.64 → 6048.66] He likes doing that.
[6048.88 → 6049.66] NVIDIA says,
[6050.60 → 6051.20] IDC,
[6051.50 → 6052.22] you fix it.
[6052.22 → 6054.60] After 32-bit Phys
[6054.60 → 6055.54] turned out to be
[6055.54 → 6057.26] the RTX 5000 series'
[6057.48 → 6058.02] kryptonite.
[6058.08 → 6058.72] Along with other things?
[6058.78 → 6058.96] Along,
[6059.08 → 6059.42] well,
[6059.84 → 6061.10] along with black screens
[6061.10 → 6062.36] and missing ROP's
[6062.36 → 6063.86] and melting power connectors
[6063.86 → 6065.84] and pricing out to lunch.
[6065.94 → 6066.52] False promises.
[6067.40 → 6068.40] NVIDIA has opted
[6068.40 → 6069.44] to address the issue
[6069.44 → 6071.08] by making Phys
[6071.08 → 6072.50] and Flow SDKs
[6072.50 → 6074.20] completely open source.
[6074.68 → 6075.56] It was already
[6075.56 → 6076.40] mostly open source,
[6076.52 → 6078.96] but for the GPU simulation current.
[6078.96 → 6079.06] No,
[6079.10 → 6079.60] this is still cool.
[6079.60 → 6080.70] The good news is
[6080.70 → 6081.78] this should make it possible
[6081.78 → 6082.50] for dodders
[6082.50 → 6083.60] to create wrappers
[6083.60 → 6084.50] for the new cards
[6084.50 → 6085.76] to play affected games
[6085.76 → 6087.48] without insane performance penalties
[6087.48 → 6090.14] and maybe even add Phys support
[6090.14 → 6092.28] to AMD and Intel cards,
[6092.34 → 6093.36] which is pretty cool.
[6093.68 → 6094.98] It may also allow
[6094.98 → 6095.66] for game devs
[6095.66 → 6096.70] to push what Phys
[6096.70 → 6097.56] can do in their games.
[6098.40 → 6099.22] The bad news
[6099.22 → 6100.14] is it's going to be
[6100.14 → 6100.68] on the community
[6100.68 → 6101.90] to make any of this happen.
[6102.00 → 6102.36] Obviously,
[6102.48 → 6103.32] like I would prefer
[6103.32 → 6104.42] that they would maintain it,
[6104.56 → 6105.56] but I will say
[6105.56 → 6107.62] this is what we've asked people
[6107.62 → 6109.08] to do when they abandon something.
[6109.16 → 6109.30] Yeah.
[6109.42 → 6110.22] And most companies
[6110.22 → 6111.04] don't do it,
[6111.18 → 6112.24] and they did do it.
[6112.50 → 6113.22] They did do it.
[6113.26 → 6114.26] They did do the thing,
[6114.40 → 6115.68] and we're going to have
[6115.68 → 6116.20] to give it
[6116.20 → 6118.14] one thumbs out of five.
[6120.40 → 6120.72] Okay.
[6121.40 → 6122.34] I still think it's cool
[6122.34 → 6122.72] that they did it.
[6122.72 → 6122.94] Yeah.
[6123.08 → 6123.96] A lot of companies
[6123.96 → 6125.06] would have just pure abandoned.
[6125.10 → 6125.74] No, no, no, no, no.
[6125.74 → 6126.68] I only have one thumb.
[6126.72 → 6127.20] It was a joke.
[6127.44 → 6128.42] My only thumb out of...
[6128.42 → 6129.16] Oh, I thought...
[6129.16 → 6129.52] No, no.
[6129.52 → 6130.06] We have four.
[6130.20 → 6130.40] Oh.
[6130.88 → 6132.08] Three thumbs out of four.
[6132.94 → 6133.26] Nice.
[6134.00 → 6134.32] Right.
[6134.32 → 6134.40] Right.
[6134.40 → 6134.44] Right.
[6134.44 → 6134.48] Right.
[6137.62 → 6140.28] We can include Dan
[6140.28 → 6140.80] and have six.
[6140.96 → 6141.82] Discussion question.
[6142.40 → 6143.44] Is this a good guy
[6143.44 → 6145.72] or lazy bum move?
[6147.10 → 6147.68] A good bum?
[6147.68 → 6148.56] I'm going to...
[6148.56 → 6149.16] Yeah, maybe.
[6149.40 → 6149.62] Yeah.
[6149.94 → 6152.22] I'm going to go on a bit of a limb here
[6152.22 → 6153.44] and go what I suspect
[6153.44 → 6154.12] might be against
[6154.12 → 6155.00] a decent amount of the audience
[6155.00 → 6156.00] and say good guy.
[6156.38 → 6157.50] A lot of companies
[6157.50 → 6158.62] would just abandon this.
[6159.16 → 6160.74] Phys has not been a primary thing
[6160.74 → 6162.72] for games for quite a while now.
[6164.00 → 6164.90] It's not going to sell
[6164.90 → 6166.32] any new games anytime soon.
[6166.32 → 6166.44] It's not going to sell
[6166.44 → 6167.10] any new games.
[6167.10 → 6168.26] They were still having to maintain it.
[6168.44 → 6168.84] Genuinely,
[6169.02 → 6170.10] a huge percentage of companies
[6170.10 → 6170.96] would have just dropped it.
[6171.14 → 6172.36] I was not surprised
[6172.36 → 6173.18] when they did it.
[6173.36 → 6174.56] Should they do the same thing
[6174.56 → 6175.32] for 3D Vision?
[6176.40 → 6176.80] Yeah.
[6177.66 → 6178.90] If they're not going to use it,
[6178.94 → 6179.56] yeah, they should.
[6180.66 → 6181.74] They absolutely should.
[6183.96 → 6184.36] Yeah.
[6184.56 → 6184.92] All right.
[6185.08 → 6186.58] Dan, you want me to do sponsors now?
[6186.88 → 6187.02] Sure.
[6187.46 → 6188.04] Let's do it.
[6188.24 → 6189.36] The show is brought to you today
[6189.36 → 6190.32] by Messi.
[6190.72 → 6191.74] You might not be
[6191.74 → 6192.82] a real firefighter,
[6193.02 → 6193.90] but you can be
[6193.90 → 6195.26] just as cool as one
[6195.26 → 6196.46] with a pair of shoes
[6196.46 → 6198.16] that keep your socks dry.
[6198.50 → 6199.12] Our sponsor,
[6199.24 → 6199.56] Messi,
[6199.72 → 6200.80] has you covered.
[6201.28 → 6203.18] Unlike those clunky rubber boots,
[6203.54 → 6204.52] Versus are breathable,
[6204.78 → 6205.04] lightweight,
[6205.30 → 6206.00] and stretchy.
[6206.22 → 6206.46] Plus,
[6206.54 → 6208.14] they come in all kinds of styles,
[6208.34 → 6209.06] like sneakers,
[6209.52 → 6210.04] slip-ons,
[6210.34 → 6210.58] boots,
[6210.68 → 6211.28] and more.
[6211.60 → 6212.68] Their weekend sneaker
[6212.68 → 6213.78] is a bestseller
[6213.78 → 6214.50] for a reason.
[6215.00 → 6216.02] Thanks to their versatility,
[6216.36 → 6217.68] from strolling through Thailand
[6217.68 → 6219.68] to clocking 20,000 steps a day
[6219.68 → 6220.08] in Tokyo,
[6220.32 → 6220.88] they've become
[6220.88 → 6222.78] Dennis's favourite travel shoes.
[6223.42 → 6224.66] They're impressively comfortable,
[6224.84 → 6225.72] even on long walks,
[6226.10 → 6227.14] and with a thicker,
[6227.36 → 6227.94] cushioned midsole
[6227.94 → 6228.70] and a relaxed fit,
[6228.92 → 6229.50] they'll have your feet
[6229.50 → 6230.90] feeling like it's the weekend
[6230.90 → 6232.04] all year round.
[6232.54 → 6233.04] Pack smarter
[6233.04 → 6233.86] and travel better
[6233.86 → 6234.58] with Messi.

[6252.52 → 6253.52] dream side hustle

[6254.94 → 6255.58] Odom helps you
[6255.58 → 6256.12] jump through
[6256.12 → 6256.92] all the hoops.
[6257.56 → 6258.46] Odom is an all-in-one

[6260.08 → 6260.70] for invoicing,

[6261.52 → 6261.86] HR,
[6262.02 → 6262.66] and more.
[6263.02 → 6263.62] Their interface
[6263.62 → 6264.50] is user-friendly
[6264.50 → 6265.34] and clean,
[6265.86 → 6266.58] enough so that
[6266.58 → 6267.30] it might completely
[6267.30 → 6268.08] change how you work,
[6268.30 → 6269.42] and it's just one platform.
[6269.68 → 6270.40] No more switching

[6272.72 → 6273.88] an employee like Dennis,

[6275.62 → 6276.78] Odom's Time Off app
[6276.78 → 6277.80] lets you track hours,
[6277.94 → 6278.58] vacation time,

[6297.54 → 6298.02] Finally,
[6298.16 → 6298.98] the show is brought
[6298.98 → 6299.74] to you by AMD.
[6300.20 → 6300.98] Spring forward
[6300.98 → 6302.06] into the ultimate
[6302.06 → 6302.84] gaming upgrade
[6302.84 → 6303.58] from our sponsor,
[6303.72 → 6303.98] AMD.
[6304.24 → 6305.32] We've done many
[6305.32 → 6306.80] AMD Ultimate Tech Upgrades,
[6307.02 → 6307.66] and if you've been
[6307.66 → 6308.34] following the series,
[6308.50 → 6309.30] we just dropped
[6309.30 → 6310.56] a new episode yesterday
[6310.56 → 6311.54] featuring Bridget,
[6311.70 → 6312.70] our design manager
[6312.70 → 6314.02] for Creator Warehouse.
[6314.36 → 6315.24] That was a lot of fun.
[6315.32 → 6315.78] Bridget and I
[6315.78 → 6317.58] never get to hang out,
[6318.00 → 6319.00] and that's actually
[6319.00 → 6319.92] one of my favourite things
[6319.92 → 6320.70] about AMD Upgrades,
[6320.70 → 6321.42] because we have
[6321.42 → 6322.40] so many really
[6322.40 → 6323.16] cool people here
[6323.16 → 6324.64] that I don't really
[6324.64 → 6325.30] get to work with
[6325.30 → 6325.70] day-to-day,
[6326.22 → 6327.72] and getting to know them,
[6328.10 → 6329.16] or giving the audience
[6329.16 → 6330.18] a chance to get to know them,
[6330.22 → 6331.60] and also getting a chance
[6331.60 → 6332.78] to like to spend some time
[6332.78 → 6334.00] with them is honestly
[6334.00 → 6334.90] my favourite thing
[6334.90 → 6336.54] about AMD Ultimate Tech Upgrade.
[6337.20 → 6338.12] The next thing is,
[6338.26 → 6338.40] oh,
[6338.88 → 6340.20] talk about handheld gaming.
[6341.86 → 6342.30] Yeah,
[6342.76 → 6343.68] handheld gaming is great.
[6344.16 → 6345.28] More games are launching
[6345.28 → 6346.22] a Steam Deck verified
[6346.22 → 6346.90] than ever.
[6346.90 → 6348.44] More games are optimized
[6348.44 → 6350.00] and launching pre-optimized
[6350.00 → 6350.52] for handheld,
[6350.88 → 6352.72] and the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme
[6352.72 → 6355.00] is coming later this year.
[6355.16 → 6356.56] So now is a chance
[6356.56 → 6358.30] to get an upgrade for free.
[6358.46 → 6358.70] Okay,
[6359.02 → 6359.32] cool.
[6359.58 → 6360.72] They're giving one lucky winner.
[6360.82 → 6360.94] Okay,
[6361.06 → 6361.48] this is,
[6361.58 → 6362.96] this is wild.
[6363.64 → 6366.42] An AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU,
[6367.00 → 6369.60] a Meg x870e Tomahawk motherboard,
[6370.00 → 6371.72] 32 gigs of DDR5 memory,
[6372.12 → 6372.76] and get this,
[6373.44 → 6374.38] a Steam Deck OLED
[6374.38 → 6375.54] with a terabyte of storage.
[6375.54 → 6376.36] Also,
[6376.52 → 6378.04] you get some Over hexagon panel lights
[6378.04 → 6379.24] to make your setup shine.
[6379.42 → 6379.66] Damn.
[6379.86 → 6381.50] Don't miss this giveaway.
[6382.00 → 6382.72] Enter to win
[6382.72 → 6383.30] at the link
[6383.30 → 6384.62] in the video description.
[6385.52 → 6386.80] Absolutely sick.
[6388.06 → 6388.76] All right.
[6389.00 → 6389.62] That's what we're doing,
[6389.74 → 6390.10] Mr. Dan.
[6390.86 → 6391.18] Topic.
[6391.82 → 6392.48] More topics.
[6393.00 → 6394.10] One cable to rule them all.
[6394.66 → 6395.24] Whatever you want.
[6395.72 → 6396.38] This is wild.
[6396.82 → 6399.28] An alliance of over 50 companies
[6399.28 → 6399.76] in China
[6399.76 → 6401.12] has released the specs
[6401.12 → 6402.12] for a new cable
[6402.12 → 6404.78] that I found borderline hard to believe.
[6405.54 → 6407.56] The general purpose media interface,
[6407.70 → 6408.54] or PMI.
[6408.96 → 6410.56] There are two different connector options.
[6410.88 → 6411.38] Type B,
[6411.70 → 6412.82] a proprietary connector
[6412.82 → 6414.96] with up to 192 gigabits
[6414.96 → 6417.04] and 480 watts,
[6417.50 → 6418.70] and Type C,
[6418.86 → 6420.94] compatible with USB Type-C,
[6421.10 → 6422.66] with up to 96 gigabits
[6422.66 → 6423.58] and 240 watts.
[6423.80 → 6424.86] Both Type-B and Type-C
[6424.86 → 6426.36] will support 8K video,
[6426.36 → 6429.62] but apparently will lack 10 and 16K,
[6429.78 → 6431.50] which HDMI 2.1 supports,
[6431.84 → 6432.22] although,
[6433.56 → 6434.32] who's using it?
[6434.98 → 6437.18] From Tom's Hardware for comparison.
[6437.32 → 6438.42] Let me have a little table here.
[6440.80 → 6442.14] Look at my numbers.
[6442.78 → 6442.92] Now,
[6442.98 → 6444.94] HDMI 2.2 is,
[6445.06 → 6446.42] I don't see it on here.
[6446.42 → 6447.10] Um,
[6447.78 → 6449.24] that actually doubles
[6449.24 → 6451.00] HDMI 2.1's bandwidth
[6451.00 → 6452.74] to 96 gigabits per second,
[6452.74 → 6453.74] but,
[6453.74 → 6455.66] even HDMI 2.2,
[6455.82 → 6457.96] I don't think does power.
[6458.72 → 6459.04] So,
[6459.24 → 6460.02] PMI,
[6460.48 → 6461.30] being able to do...
[6461.30 → 6463.06] The 480 watts of power delivery
[6463.06 → 6464.84] is crazy.
[6465.16 → 6465.34] Yeah,
[6465.38 → 6466.76] you could power your monitor
[6466.76 → 6467.58] off your computer,
[6468.04 → 6468.16] like,
[6468.22 → 6469.42] just off your computer power supply,
[6469.48 → 6469.92] and it's like,
[6470.06 → 6470.68] why not?
[6471.22 → 6471.44] Yeah.
[6471.68 → 6471.98] I mean,
[6471.98 → 6472.48] that makes sense,
[6472.54 → 6472.66] sure.
[6472.70 → 6473.84] That's so sick.
[6474.02 → 6474.40] Could be just,
[6474.48 → 6474.56] like,
[6474.58 → 6475.44] have fewer cables?
[6475.84 → 6476.62] I'm into it.
[6476.74 → 6477.74] And the size of the cable.
[6478.62 → 6479.10] And the
[6479.22 → 6479.46] you know,
[6479.52 → 6481.06] no big chunky adapter
[6481.06 → 6481.52] in the middle,
[6481.64 → 6481.80] too.
[6482.24 → 6482.48] Like,
[6482.62 → 6484.68] the cable management
[6484.68 → 6486.56] options here
[6486.56 → 6487.26] is,
[6488.34 → 6489.08] are wild.
[6489.28 → 6490.54] Let me see if I can find the picture.
[6490.68 → 6491.52] I know Riley...
[6491.52 → 6491.66] Dude,
[6491.72 → 6492.78] you could power your monitor
[6492.78 → 6493.50] off your computer
[6493.50 → 6495.08] and daisy chain the power,
[6495.16 → 6495.44] probably,
[6495.50 → 6496.16] in some scenarios.
[6496.32 → 6496.76] Here we go.
[6497.12 → 6498.66] I keep bringing up articles
[6498.66 → 6499.86] and I can't find them.
[6499.98 → 6500.74] Riley has a...
[6500.74 → 6500.88] No,
[6500.94 → 6501.10] wait,
[6501.18 → 6502.36] that's not what the connector looks like,
[6502.40 → 6502.58] is it?
[6502.60 → 6503.38] Is that just a mock-up?
[6503.84 → 6505.04] I think that's just a mock-up.
[6505.18 → 6507.24] I think that is a mock-up,
[6507.28 → 6508.22] but I think it's like that.
[6508.34 → 6508.44] Yeah,
[6508.44 → 6509.94] that's just a wide USB-C.
[6510.34 → 6510.50] Yeah,
[6510.52 → 6511.80] but they described it as a USB-C
[6511.80 → 6512.08] that got,
[6512.16 → 6512.24] like,
[6512.30 → 6512.74] stretched out,
[6512.92 → 6513.30] basically.
[6514.08 → 6514.32] Oh,
[6514.40 → 6514.64] okay.
[6514.66 → 6515.30] I've seen that description
[6515.30 → 6516.40] in multiple places.
[6516.78 → 6516.94] So,
[6516.98 → 6519.12] I think it is kind of supposed
[6519.12 → 6519.70] to look like that.
[6519.96 → 6521.56] Everyone else is just using images
[6521.56 → 6522.28] of,
[6522.28 → 6522.60] like,
[6522.68 → 6524.18] HDMI ports.
[6524.34 → 6524.44] And so,
[6524.48 → 6524.58] oh,
[6524.62 → 6524.94] here we go.
[6524.98 → 6525.32] Here we go.
[6525.86 → 6526.18] Okay.
[6527.10 → 6527.98] PMI type B.
[6527.98 → 6528.50] Oh,
[6528.50 → 6528.60] but,
[6528.60 → 6529.58] but,
[6529.58 → 6530.10] but,
[6530.10 → 6530.36] but,
[6530.36 → 6530.98] but,
[6530.98 → 6531.22] but,
[6531.22 → 6531.80] but,
[6531.80 → 6532.30] oh,
[6532.30 → 6532.72] sorry.
[6532.72 → 6533.60] That sort of worked.
[6533.84 → 6534.00] Sure.
[6534.08 → 6534.46] There you go.
[6534.54 → 6534.94] I don't know.
[6535.04 → 6535.44] Like,
[6535.48 → 6535.86] kind of,
[6535.96 → 6536.70] are we going to get like,
[6536.76 → 6537.12] there we go.
[6537.26 → 6539.16] Mini B and micro B.
[6539.18 → 6539.64] It reminded me a lot.
[6540.08 → 6540.82] Oh yeah.
[6541.36 → 6542.64] Micro B comes back.
[6543.18 → 6543.42] Oh no.
[6543.46 → 6544.46] I'm going to lose it.
[6546.80 → 6548.32] I already saw two letters.
[6548.64 → 6550.12] It reminded me a lot of,
[6550.12 → 6550.66] uh,
[6550.70 → 6551.64] old Apple connectors.
[6552.80 → 6553.32] The wide boy ones.
[6553.34 → 6554.42] Here's my question though.
[6554.88 → 6556.18] As good as this is,
[6556.60 → 6558.12] and I am all for
[6558.12 → 6559.94] higher bandwidth video interfaces.
[6560.50 → 6560.78] Like,
[6561.10 → 6561.32] yeah,
[6561.56 → 6562.04] for real.
[6562.30 → 6562.44] Yeah.
[6562.50 → 6562.84] Like with,
[6562.84 → 6563.44] with OLED,
[6563.44 → 6566.04] having the fast switching time that it does,
[6566.32 → 6566.54] man,
[6566.62 → 6567.42] drive up them Hertz,
[6567.80 → 6568.00] you know,
[6568.10 → 6568.60] give me,
[6568.70 → 6569.66] give me smoother displays.
[6569.66 → 6570.18] Like I'm,
[6570.34 → 6571.34] I'm super into it.
[6572.10 → 6577.98] But the article that I actually read earlier today about HDMI 2.2 basically was like,
[6578.04 → 6578.16] yeah,
[6578.20 → 6581.90] the appetite in the CE industry is not super high for more bandwidth.
[6582.36 → 6582.80] Um,
[6583.28 → 6586.90] given that the adoption of AK is nothing essentially.
[6587.68 → 6588.12] And,
[6588.24 → 6589.08] um,
[6589.08 → 6590.10] realistically,
[6590.10 → 6590.12] realistically,
[6590.12 → 6593.00] do we need more than 144 Hertz or what?
[6593.10 → 6596.94] I think it's about 144 is the maximum you can do on an HDMI 2.1 link,
[6596.94 → 6597.50] uh,
[6597.50 → 6599.82] 120 on most like AV receivers and stuff.
[6599.88 → 6599.98] Do,
[6600.04 → 6601.76] do most people need more than that?
[6601.76 → 6605.12] Given that they're running game consoles that can't drive more than that anyway.
[6605.12 → 6605.60] Like,
[6605.60 → 6607.96] is there really a hunger for this?
[6607.96 → 6608.48] The power though.
[6608.54 → 6611.20] That will drive industry adoption.
[6611.56 → 6611.88] Really?
[6612.48 → 6614.72] The USB-C compatible one,
[6615.04 → 6620.02] still pushing 240 watts is cool.
[6620.70 → 6621.22] Um,
[6621.22 → 6623.00] but that's still within USB 4.
[6623.00 → 6626.00] There's also a couple of things kind of,
[6626.24 → 6626.74] um,
[6627.10 → 6629.38] overlooked in the Tom's hardware chart.
[6629.90 → 6630.64] Thunderbolt 5,
[6630.74 → 6631.26] for instance,
[6631.34 → 6637.00] has an asymmetric mode where it can operate at greater than 40 gigabits per second in one of the directions.
[6637.00 → 6638.58] And the idea there is that,
[6638.58 → 6639.08] uh,
[6639.08 → 6641.82] you're driving a bunch of displays off of the device,
[6641.82 → 6642.38] uh,
[6642.38 → 6644.56] but you have less data coming back the other way.
[6645.04 → 6645.48] Um,
[6645.48 → 6645.84] so there,
[6645.88 → 6648.64] there are a few things that are not a hundred percent,
[6648.64 → 6649.06] uh,
[6649.06 → 6651.32] accounted for in the Tom's hardware chart here.
[6651.32 → 6652.92] Um,
[6652.92 → 6653.76] but even then,
[6653.76 → 6655.68] I guess my question is,
[6655.68 → 6657.48] what's going to drive,
[6657.68 → 6659.50] what's going to drive industry adoption of this?
[6659.50 → 6660.48] Because the
[6660.58 → 6663.54] the connectors that ultimately win,
[6663.54 → 6666.66] the connectors that ultimately win are the ones.
[6666.72 → 6666.82] Yeah.
[6666.82 → 6667.50] But I mean,
[6667.50 → 6671.36] you can't single-handedly HDMI is as far as I can tell,
[6671.44 → 6673.02] literally never going to change.
[6674.04 → 6674.48] Like,
[6674.54 → 6674.90] honestly,
[6675.00 → 6676.96] like in the consumer electronics industry,
[6677.04 → 6677.68] IT industry.
[6677.68 → 6677.88] Okay.
[6677.88 → 6678.84] Maybe we could talk about that.
[6678.84 → 6679.08] Or like,
[6679.10 → 6679.60] I could see,
[6679.60 → 6682.04] I could see a niche VR vendor or something,
[6682.16 → 6682.46] you know,
[6682.46 → 6684.34] pushing this or something like I could see,
[6684.42 → 6685.08] I could see,
[6685.08 → 6686.04] um,
[6686.16 → 6686.78] here's a hot take.
[6686.78 → 6690.72] How many people are actually plugging things in with HDMI to their TV these days?
[6691.68 → 6692.08] Lots.
[6693.18 → 6693.58] Really?
[6694.28 → 6694.64] Yeah.
[6694.82 → 6695.80] I kind of doubt it.
[6696.46 → 6700.32] Do you think people are just running their smart TV OS, and they're just using Netflix that way?
[6700.36 → 6701.38] I bet you that's most people.
[6701.40 → 6703.78] Anyone with a game console has to plug in via HDMI.
[6704.06 → 6706.98] A lot of people are going away from non-switch game consoles.
[6707.04 → 6708.96] Anyone with more devices than,
[6708.96 → 6710.14] probably also be adapters.
[6710.30 → 6713.78] Anyone with more devices than are supported is going to be using an AVR.
[6713.90 → 6716.70] And those are 1 billion percent using HDMI.
[6716.70 → 6717.94] I don't think that's that very many people.
[6717.96 → 6720.04] Anyone using a sound bar is using HDMI.
[6721.40 → 6721.74] Hmm.
[6722.20 → 6724.72] HDMI is so entrenched.
[6724.80 → 6724.98] I mean,
[6725.08 → 6725.70] think about it.
[6725.70 → 6727.20] The sound bar argument you might have made.
[6727.20 → 6731.12] HDMI charges for every port on your device.
[6731.12 → 6735.10] And they still haven't walked away from it.
[6735.88 → 6737.94] DisplayPort was technologically superior for...
[6737.94 → 6738.32] Chromecast, dongles.
[6738.48 → 6739.60] I don't think a lot of people are getting those.
[6739.68 → 6740.86] Chromecast is built into a lot of stuff.
[6740.86 → 6745.12] Like, DisplayPort was superior in terms of bandwidth delivery for ages.
[6745.26 → 6748.90] HDMI did have some features that were better supported.
[6749.06 → 6751.02] I think, like, deep colour came first to HDMI.
[6751.02 → 6752.20] But I've been...
[6752.20 → 6757.88] Dude, I've been trying to figure out for years why they keep paying this HDMI license fee.
[6758.76 → 6761.52] And I think it's just because when you've got this level of momentum,
[6762.02 → 6765.14] you can't get away from this connector.
[6765.14 → 6770.94] And the fact that they've managed to keep it backward and forward compatible all these years,
[6771.08 → 6772.88] the ports, the cables...
[6772.88 → 6776.14] I mean, obviously, you need a higher quality cable to run the new one,
[6776.18 → 6777.40] so it doesn't always work.
[6777.48 → 6779.08] But the fact that, like, theoretically,
[6779.64 → 6782.54] you could take an OG HDMI device,
[6782.64 → 6783.88] plug a brand-new cable into it,
[6783.90 → 6785.00] and you're good to go.
[6785.04 → 6786.10] You can just buy that at the store.
[6786.18 → 6786.68] It's a commodity.
[6787.10 → 6789.24] The fact that you could take an ancient cable,
[6789.44 → 6792.02] and as long as the distance is short enough,
[6792.02 → 6795.54] you could conceivably run a brand-new device linked with it,
[6795.60 → 6797.74] like, it's admirable.
[6798.50 → 6799.48] It's a good thing.
[6801.10 → 6803.46] Like, think about how many cables were thrown away
[6803.46 → 6806.12] when we transitioned from composite to component,
[6806.26 → 6807.48] and then from component to HDMI.
[6807.60 → 6811.10] The fact that you can continue to reuse this stuff for so long...
[6811.10 → 6811.90] I don't know.
[6811.98 → 6813.90] HDMI, it's a...
[6813.90 → 6817.54] It's going to be tough to replace.
[6817.66 → 6818.86] I mean...
[6818.86 → 6819.78] Yeah.
[6819.78 → 6822.60] Maybe I've talked myself out of PMI.
[6822.70 → 6823.48] I wish them luck,
[6823.58 → 6824.94] because I want more bandwidth.
[6825.14 → 6825.74] Give me more bandwidth.
[6825.86 → 6826.72] Give me power delivery.
[6827.28 → 6830.82] Chinese TV manufacturing is doing a very similar thing
[6830.82 → 6833.00] that Chinese vehicle manufacturing is doing.
[6833.54 → 6833.80] Sure.
[6833.98 → 6836.26] And they could just sort of force this.
[6836.98 → 6838.78] I do actually...
[6839.46 → 6841.42] The soundbars' argument was interesting.
[6841.60 → 6842.36] Some people have brought up
[6842.36 → 6844.70] that some soundbars can connect over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
[6845.12 → 6845.42] Yeah.
[6845.42 → 6846.94] But the soundbar argument is interesting.
[6847.10 → 6847.42] I honestly think...
[6847.42 → 6849.24] I'm not going to do Atmos over Bluetooth.
[6849.48 → 6850.24] Sorry, it's not happening.
[6850.34 → 6852.32] The audience watching this and you
[6852.32 → 6854.48] might be skewed towards more people
[6854.48 → 6856.64] having devices to put into their TVs
[6856.64 → 6859.02] than you think is necessarily average.
[6859.20 → 6860.30] But then here's my question.
[6860.50 → 6862.76] I promise you over the last four or five years,
[6862.84 → 6864.24] the amount of people plugging things
[6864.24 → 6866.08] into their TV with HDMI has decreased.
[6866.24 → 6866.56] Sure.
[6866.80 → 6869.80] But then that actually kind of feeds into my argument
[6869.80 → 6871.44] for why we shouldn't bother
[6871.44 → 6874.94] to transition the industry to this new connector,
[6874.94 → 6876.96] whose only benefit is like,
[6877.16 → 6879.46] higher bandwidth, more resolution.
[6880.42 → 6881.36] Yeah, that's kind of fair.
[6882.46 → 6885.08] So it's doubly unnecessary then
[6885.08 → 6885.78] if nobody's putting anything into the TV.
[6885.78 → 6887.32] I definitely don't think it's necessary,
[6887.48 → 6889.38] but I think it might be China wanting to own
[6889.38 → 6893.26] like a cable interface standard.
[6894.16 → 6895.04] I mean, that's fair enough,
[6895.04 → 6898.58] but they need buy-in from the entire world.
[6898.72 → 6899.36] All the other devices.
[6899.36 → 6899.78] Essentially.
[6899.78 → 6900.22] Yeah.
[6900.38 → 6902.16] Because if all of a sudden,
[6902.46 → 6904.40] you're Only or Demon or whatever
[6904.40 → 6905.74] and your AVR receiver,
[6906.26 → 6908.40] I know that's an ATM thing,
[6908.48 → 6909.52] but I'm just going to say that.
[6909.82 → 6911.14] So your AVR receiver,
[6911.44 → 6913.38] it has to have like a different version
[6913.38 → 6915.88] with like a modular like IO thing
[6915.88 → 6917.08] for the China market.
[6917.28 → 6918.50] You're just like, oh my God.
[6919.14 → 6919.32] No.
[6919.40 → 6920.84] I don't think it's the China market though.
[6921.10 → 6922.32] So you think they're just going to try
[6922.32 → 6923.26] and like push this world?
[6923.40 → 6924.14] How though?
[6924.94 → 6926.36] It might have to be a mix of connectors.
[6926.50 → 6928.10] I mean, right now we have DisplayPort and HDMI.
[6928.10 → 6930.38] Not on an AVR.
[6931.46 → 6932.60] No, I'm saying on the TV.
[6932.94 → 6934.42] Oh, not on a TV?
[6936.00 → 6936.36] Almost.
[6937.96 → 6939.60] Other than commercial displays,
[6940.24 → 6942.18] I can't think of a single TV
[6942.18 → 6943.38] that has DisplayPort.
[6943.48 → 6943.78] And in fact,
[6943.86 → 6945.32] I can't even think of a single TV
[6945.32 → 6946.70] off the top of my head
[6946.70 → 6948.22] that has like a USB-C
[6948.22 → 6950.14] that supports like DisplayPort alt mode.
[6950.64 → 6952.20] Like it's just not a thing.
[6952.30 → 6953.38] There's a lot that have standard USB,
[6953.52 → 6954.24] but not for display.
[6954.82 → 6957.28] HDMI is universal
[6957.28 → 6958.50] in AV.
[6958.86 → 6959.98] I don't think that means
[6959.98 → 6961.98] it can never be taken over.
[6962.32 → 6963.96] Especially when you have
[6963.96 → 6966.10] TCL coming and swinging like they are.
[6966.16 → 6967.40] I think they could use TCL
[6967.40 → 6968.20] to force this out.
[6968.72 → 6970.06] And I suspect that might
[6970.06 → 6971.12] actually be the strategy.
[6971.12 → 6972.42] I think that would just
[6972.42 → 6974.62] literally destroy TCL's sales.
[6974.82 → 6976.18] I don't necessarily think so.
[6976.60 → 6977.02] Like if,
[6977.30 → 6977.90] okay,
[6978.22 → 6981.30] if they eat the cost
[6981.30 → 6983.76] of like the dongle breakouts
[6983.76 → 6985.50] and they make it
[6985.50 → 6987.34] like HDMI signal compatible
[6987.34 → 6987.96] or something,
[6988.02 → 6988.74] but they'd have to work
[6988.74 → 6990.38] with the HDMI forum
[6990.38 → 6991.18] or consortium
[6991.18 → 6991.98] or whatever they're called.
[6992.52 → 6993.14] Is it a forum?
[6993.24 → 6993.82] I think it's a forum.
[6993.90 → 6994.48] They'd have to work
[6994.48 → 6995.70] with the HDMI forum
[6995.70 → 6997.14] on that
[6997.14 → 6998.02] unless they like
[6998.02 → 6999.38] just reverse engineered it
[6999.38 → 6999.70] or like,
[7000.22 → 7001.80] it just doesn't seem,
[7001.96 → 7004.16] it doesn't seem plausible
[7004.16 → 7004.96] right now.
[7004.96 → 7006.10] But I could be wrong.
[7006.36 → 7006.94] I could be wrong.
[7007.02 → 7007.10] I mean,
[7007.14 → 7008.28] I thought DVI was great
[7008.28 → 7009.16] and didn't need to go anywhere
[7009.16 → 7010.00] and that went away.
[7010.00 → 7012.86] I liked DVI as well.
[7012.98 → 7014.26] I liked chunky connectors.
[7014.66 → 7015.30] We'll see as well.
[7015.52 → 7017.56] They announced the standard.
[7017.68 → 7018.06] That doesn't mean
[7018.06 → 7018.96] it's anywhere near
[7018.96 → 7020.46] ready for market.
[7020.68 → 7020.84] Yeah.
[7021.28 → 7022.26] So it could be quite a while
[7022.26 → 7023.12] until we see what happens.
[7023.58 → 7024.62] G.E. Kun says
[7024.62 → 7025.68] you could power peripherals
[7025.68 → 7026.26] from the TV.
[7026.40 → 7026.76] Yeah, you could,
[7026.82 → 7027.58] but you could already do that
[7027.58 → 7028.34] because your TV's plugged
[7028.34 → 7028.94] into the wall
[7028.94 → 7030.52] and you're not going to be powering.
[7030.64 → 7031.14] Actually, yeah,
[7031.14 → 7031.62] you could power
[7031.62 → 7033.02] a pretty decent power TV,
[7033.22 → 7034.28] but like here's the thing.
[7034.38 → 7034.66] Why?
[7035.10 → 7036.16] Because now you have to put
[7036.16 → 7038.18] like an over spec power supply
[7038.18 → 7039.98] inside whatever device
[7039.98 → 7041.82] that's going to be powering the TV.
[7042.22 → 7043.22] Why do you want to do that?
[7043.46 → 7044.70] You're just taking a cost
[7044.70 → 7046.68] that could be in the TV
[7046.68 → 7049.22] and that would be right sized
[7049.22 → 7049.94] for the TV
[7049.94 → 7051.14] and then you have to like
[7051.14 → 7051.92] over spec it
[7051.92 → 7052.74] because you have no idea
[7052.74 → 7053.38] what kind of TV
[7053.38 → 7054.62] someone's going to plug into it
[7054.62 → 7055.94] into the AV receiver.
[7056.52 → 7057.66] Why are we doing this?
[7057.80 → 7058.88] That I think makes sense
[7058.88 → 7059.56] for computers.
[7059.76 → 7060.12] Like you're saying
[7060.12 → 7061.24] to be able to power your monitor
[7061.24 → 7062.14] or whatever would be pretty sweet.
[7062.14 → 7062.62] Yeah, but like
[7062.62 → 7063.22] do you want,
[7063.44 → 7064.54] do you want to have to buy
[7064.54 → 7065.36] an AV receiver
[7065.36 → 7067.50] that has a 2000 watt power supply
[7067.50 → 7069.10] just in case it has to power
[7069.10 → 7070.18] a PlayStation 6
[7070.18 → 7070.84] and an Xbox,
[7071.34 → 7072.08] you know,
[7072.14 → 7072.62] series,
[7072.92 → 7074.12] whatever they call it
[7074.12 → 7075.46] and your TV
[7075.46 → 7075.74] like,
[7075.94 → 7076.26] no.
[7076.38 → 7076.96] Especially when like
[7076.96 → 7078.02] the cable management system
[7078.02 → 7078.78] of home theatre setups
[7078.78 → 7080.80] is like the most solved one
[7080.80 → 7081.32] that exists.
[7081.54 → 7081.60] Yeah.
[7082.26 → 7082.70] Yeah.
[7082.84 → 7084.14] I just don't really see the point.
[7084.14 → 7088.74] GKGK says the other way.
[7088.88 → 7089.44] Like it doesn't,
[7089.46 → 7090.42] it doesn't matter
[7090.42 → 7090.86] either way,
[7090.92 → 7091.38] either way,
[7091.42 → 7092.12] you're putting an oversized
[7092.12 → 7093.44] power supply in something
[7093.44 → 7094.70] and then you're going
[7094.70 → 7095.88] DC power out
[7095.88 → 7096.92] to all the other connected.
[7097.28 → 7097.64] Why?
[7097.80 → 7098.62] Just plug them all in.
[7099.66 → 7100.02] Okay.
[7100.08 → 7101.36] So I just want to,
[7101.52 → 7102.22] because there's a bunch of people
[7102.22 → 7102.68] that have been saying
[7102.68 → 7103.52] a very similar thing
[7103.52 → 7104.60] and I want to try to explain
[7104.60 → 7105.50] my argument a little bit better.
[7106.18 → 7107.70] Zach 3323 said,
[7107.76 → 7108.74] I got to disagree with Luke.
[7108.82 → 7110.34] My parents and grandparents
[7110.34 → 7111.10] use HDMI
[7111.10 → 7112.16] because it's what their
[7112.16 → 7113.56] old TVs have now.
[7113.80 → 7115.24] There are a ton of dumb TVs
[7115.24 → 7116.62] people buy Chromecast for.
[7116.96 → 7117.84] Wi-Fi connection for things
[7117.84 → 7118.54] like soundbars
[7118.54 → 7119.28] is relatively new.
[7120.18 → 7120.62] Totally.
[7121.16 → 7121.82] What I'm talking about
[7121.82 → 7123.16] is new TVs,
[7123.62 → 7125.56] not old TVs.
[7126.18 → 7126.36] Yeah.
[7126.54 → 7127.46] These would be new TVs
[7127.46 → 7128.12] that are being sold.
[7128.50 → 7128.60] It,
[7128.78 → 7128.92] the
[7129.12 → 7130.30] I don't think there's a huge
[7130.30 → 7132.04] argument for a need for this.
[7132.12 → 7133.20] I think the argument for this
[7133.20 → 7133.72] would be that
[7133.72 → 7135.12] China wants to own
[7135.12 → 7137.12] a cable connection standard.
[7137.32 → 7138.70] They came up with PMI
[7138.70 → 7139.90] and they could push it.
[7139.96 → 7140.92] They could push it through TCL.
[7140.92 → 7142.58] That would be new TVs,
[7142.92 → 7143.78] not old TVs.
[7143.90 → 7144.02] Yeah.
[7144.14 → 7145.50] And these TCL TVs,
[7145.62 → 7146.66] they could include things
[7146.66 → 7147.38] like Chromecast.
[7147.50 → 7148.40] They could include things
[7148.40 → 7150.26] like that where it would be.
[7150.38 → 7151.46] But they'd have to collaborate
[7151.46 → 7152.50] with Google for that.
[7152.80 → 7153.28] So good luck.
[7153.46 → 7154.46] Or they'll have some form
[7154.46 → 7155.34] of casting solution
[7155.34 → 7155.80] of their own
[7155.80 → 7156.48] and just not care.
[7157.34 → 7158.86] Which sounds probably
[7158.86 → 7159.36] more likely.
[7159.90 → 7160.48] But I'm,
[7160.54 → 7162.18] I am not talking about this
[7162.18 → 7162.92] somehow working
[7162.92 → 7164.14] for your old TVs
[7164.14 → 7164.94] that has genuinely
[7164.94 → 7165.90] nothing to do
[7165.90 → 7166.60] with the conversation
[7166.60 → 7167.90] or the argument whatsoever.
[7168.24 → 7169.20] And I've seen a bunch
[7169.20 → 7169.96] of comments about that.
[7169.96 → 7170.56] So it's,
[7170.70 → 7172.14] I could very likely
[7172.14 → 7172.74] be wrong.
[7172.86 → 7173.84] I think it's an interesting
[7173.84 → 7174.60] angle to take
[7174.60 → 7175.62] so I'm just sticking with it.
[7176.40 → 7176.84] But,
[7177.42 → 7178.30] yeah,
[7178.58 → 7179.24] that's where I'm at.
[7181.94 → 7182.74] No, I mean,
[7183.04 → 7186.26] I'm saying I could be wrong
[7186.26 → 7186.90] but I'm,
[7186.90 → 7188.38] I'm decently confident
[7188.38 → 7189.34] in that take.
[7189.34 → 7192.26] I think it's pretty easy
[7192.26 → 7193.06] to shift people over
[7193.06 → 7193.50] to Bluetooth
[7193.50 → 7194.44] for soundbars.
[7195.94 → 7197.72] I think the people
[7197.72 → 7198.32] with consoles
[7198.32 → 7199.14] are overestimating
[7199.14 → 7199.72] how many of them
[7199.72 → 7200.14] there are
[7200.14 → 7201.00] and the ability
[7201.00 → 7202.40] to have an adapter
[7202.40 → 7203.66] or they're underestimating
[7203.66 → 7204.04] the ability
[7204.04 → 7204.74] to have an adapter.
[7205.30 → 7205.84] And I,
[7205.84 → 7207.00] I really think
[7207.00 → 7208.34] the techie audience
[7208.34 → 7208.96] that we have
[7208.96 → 7209.92] is underestimating
[7209.92 → 7210.70] the amount of people
[7210.70 → 7211.66] that just buy a TV
[7211.66 → 7212.52] and just use the TV
[7212.52 → 7212.98] as is.
[7212.98 → 7215.26] In what looks
[7215.26 → 7216.66] like an April Fool's joke,
[7217.24 → 7217.94] Kawasaki,
[7218.66 → 7219.74] of all companies,
[7220.14 → 7220.88] has unveiled
[7220.88 → 7221.94] the Corley,
[7222.58 → 7224.62] a rideable robot horse
[7224.62 → 7225.60] that the Japanese
[7225.60 → 7226.50] motor maker says
[7226.50 → 7228.48] is actually coming
[7228.48 → 7231.20] sometime after 2050.
[7232.20 → 7233.42] Is that a typo?
[7234.82 → 7235.64] Is that,
[7235.74 → 7236.94] is that date right?
[7238.10 → 7238.66] Anyway,
[7238.74 → 7239.46] do you want to watch this?
[7239.96 → 7240.58] Yeah, sure.
[7240.64 → 7241.26] It's only about
[7241.26 → 7242.12] a minute long
[7242.12 → 7242.84] and realistically
[7242.84 → 7243.48] I don't think
[7243.48 → 7244.90] I haven't seen it yet.
[7245.06 → 7245.88] I haven't seen it yet.
[7245.96 → 7246.32] Realistically,
[7246.44 → 7247.30] I don't think Kawasaki
[7247.30 → 7247.90] is going to
[7247.90 → 7249.04] copyright strike us here.
[7249.38 → 7249.74] They might.
[7250.30 → 7250.66] I mean,
[7250.70 → 7251.70] we've seen dumber stuff.
[7251.92 → 7252.66] Japanese brand.
[7252.80 → 7253.10] What?
[7254.12 → 7254.48] Okay,
[7254.50 → 7255.26] this is just CG.
[7256.40 → 7256.80] Well,
[7256.88 → 7257.16] yeah.
[7258.06 → 7258.26] Well,
[7258.26 → 7258.46] I don't know.
[7258.50 → 7258.90] I thought they might
[7258.90 → 7259.44] have a prototype.
[7259.98 → 7260.34] No.
[7261.86 → 7262.74] Not when it's coming
[7262.74 → 7263.42] in 2050.
[7265.28 → 7265.62] Okay,
[7265.66 → 7265.76] well,
[7265.80 → 7266.36] I thought it would be,
[7266.42 → 7266.68] okay,
[7266.76 → 7266.86] well,
[7266.86 → 7267.82] this is just stupid then.
[7270.10 → 7271.32] It's so funny
[7271.32 → 7272.02] how similar
[7272.02 → 7272.94] that is to the
[7272.94 → 7273.78] Pokémon Go
[7273.78 → 7274.74] April Fool's thing.
[7275.14 → 7275.50] Yeah.
[7276.06 → 7276.46] Yeah.
[7276.58 → 7276.86] Okay.
[7277.08 → 7277.80] I still like the
[7277.88 → 7278.56] I'm disappointed
[7278.56 → 7280.20] that it's completely CG.
[7280.36 → 7280.84] They don't even have
[7280.84 → 7281.76] like a proof of concept.
[7281.90 → 7283.08] I expected it to be like,
[7283.28 → 7284.68] like slow or something,
[7285.28 → 7285.60] you know,
[7285.60 → 7286.26] like kind of,
[7286.34 → 7286.80] whip one of those,
[7286.84 → 7288.04] but like doing something.
[7288.56 → 7289.08] Um,
[7289.46 → 7289.64] well,
[7289.72 → 7290.58] some brand went,
[7290.66 → 7291.30] wouldn't it be cool
[7291.30 → 7292.10] if we did something
[7292.10 → 7293.76] 25 years from now?
[7293.84 → 7294.74] That'd be sick.
[7295.48 → 7295.80] Yeah.
[7296.24 → 7297.48] They say it will be powered
[7297.48 → 7299.74] by a 150cc hydrogen engine,
[7300.00 → 7300.80] have rubber hooves
[7300.80 → 7301.46] to handle terrain
[7301.46 → 7302.40] like grasslands,
[7302.52 → 7303.02] rocky areas,
[7303.10 → 7303.78] and rubble fields
[7303.78 → 7304.52] and controls
[7304.52 → 7305.38] that function similar
[7305.38 → 7306.42] to riding an actual horse.
[7306.48 → 7307.18] I'll believe it when I see it.
[7307.76 → 7308.22] Okay.
[7308.62 → 7309.20] Dire wolves
[7309.20 → 7311.32] are so not back.
[7312.48 → 7314.80] Colossal Biosciences,
[7315.06 → 7316.40] the genetic engineering company
[7316.40 → 7317.18] for people who drink
[7317.18 → 7318.08] monster energy,
[7318.50 → 7319.48] claimed to have achieved
[7319.48 → 7320.40] the world's first
[7320.40 → 7321.20] extinction
[7321.20 → 7322.06] in the form of
[7322.06 → 7323.78] living dire wolf pups
[7323.78 → 7324.96] named Romulus,
[7325.46 → 7325.90] Remus,
[7326.24 → 7327.36] the mythical founders of Rome,
[7327.54 → 7328.50] and Halves.
[7329.42 → 7330.92] The news made the cover of Time
[7330.92 → 7332.36] and Game of Thrones creator
[7332.36 → 7333.48] George R.R. Martin
[7333.48 → 7334.80] posted a photo of himself
[7334.80 → 7336.16] holding one of the pups.
[7336.96 → 7338.48] There is some actually
[7338.48 → 7339.36] cool stuff here.
[7339.78 → 7341.52] Colossal managed to extract DNA
[7341.52 → 7343.92] from 72,000-year-old
[7343.92 → 7345.18] dire wolf fossils,
[7345.80 → 7347.82] identified dire wolfish traits,
[7348.04 → 7349.08] and edited the genome
[7349.08 → 7350.18] of gray wolf embryos
[7350.18 → 7351.12] to emulate those
[7351.12 → 7351.42] traits.
[7351.50 → 7351.90] Of course,
[7352.08 → 7353.04] that means the pups
[7353.04 → 7354.30] are not dire wolves,
[7354.38 → 7355.30] but they are modified
[7355.30 → 7356.02] gray wolves
[7356.02 → 7357.14] that look pretty much
[7357.14 → 7358.84] exactly like an arctic wolf.
[7360.10 → 7361.72] And our source is
[7361.72 → 7363.00] arcticwolf.png.
[7363.78 → 7364.32] Yep,
[7364.52 → 7365.38] that's an arctic wolf.
[7365.52 → 7365.72] All right.
[7366.06 → 7366.24] Cool.
[7367.44 → 7368.90] The best available evidence
[7368.90 → 7369.78] also indicates that
[7369.78 → 7370.46] dire wolves were not
[7370.46 → 7371.64] actually wolves,
[7371.84 → 7372.62] and they were more
[7372.62 → 7373.94] closely related to coyotes,
[7374.12 → 7375.02] African wild dogs,
[7375.40 → 7376.88] and what the heck
[7376.88 → 7378.62] are d-holes?
[7378.62 → 7378.98] D-holes.
[7380.80 → 7382.10] It's definitely not
[7382.10 → 7382.90] how you pronounce it,
[7382.96 → 7383.44] but...
[7383.44 → 7383.80] D-holes?
[7384.64 → 7385.32] It's got to be.
[7385.68 → 7386.10] There's no way
[7386.10 → 7386.88] it's D-hole,
[7387.00 → 7387.18] dude.
[7391.72 → 7392.60] Oh, it bit me.
[7392.66 → 7393.28] What a D-hole.
[7393.72 → 7394.08] That's it.
[7394.12 → 7394.94] You're going to name that.
[7394.94 → 7397.60] What's that fish?
[7398.54 → 7400.02] Like, stupid-headed fish,
[7400.08 → 7400.76] or whatever it's called?
[7403.92 → 7404.28] Babe.
[7405.36 → 7406.48] Dumb head or something.
[7406.52 → 7407.26] Let me try to find it.
[7407.28 → 7408.06] You have to be kidding me.
[7409.44 → 7410.60] Dumb gulper shark
[7410.60 → 7411.12] is one of them,
[7411.18 → 7411.82] but that's not the one
[7411.82 → 7412.52] I'm talking about.
[7414.62 → 7415.56] Yeah, yeah,
[7415.62 → 7416.10] that's it.
[7416.44 → 7417.32] Let me look it up.
[7420.96 → 7421.32] Really?
[7421.32 → 7421.42] Really?
[7421.42 → 7421.46] Really?
[7421.46 → 7421.50] Really?
[7424.94 → 7431.88] Oh, no.
[7436.04 → 7438.14] What a name, dude.
[7440.22 → 7442.46] Oh, that sucks.
[7443.30 → 7445.18] Okay, so let's talk about the...
[7445.18 → 7446.12] Let's talk about the
[7446.12 → 7447.02] but why, though.
[7447.54 → 7448.86] Colossal says that their work
[7448.86 → 7450.06] can restore niches
[7450.06 → 7450.82] in the ecosystem
[7450.82 → 7451.52] that vanished
[7451.52 → 7452.54] when animals went extinct,
[7452.54 → 7455.02] but the part
[7455.02 → 7455.50] that we appear
[7455.50 → 7456.14] to be overlooking
[7456.14 → 7456.90] is that none of that
[7456.90 → 7458.02] helps when the dire wolves
[7458.02 → 7458.44] prey.
[7458.82 → 7459.52] Large herbivores
[7459.52 → 7460.34] like wild horses,
[7460.54 → 7461.12] ground sloths,
[7461.40 → 7462.00] and mastodons
[7462.00 → 7463.98] are also off the market.
[7464.90 → 7466.02] Colossal is doing
[7466.02 → 7467.16] actual conservation work,
[7467.22 → 7467.96] helping to restore
[7467.96 → 7469.12] less flashy species
[7469.12 → 7469.96] like red wolves,
[7470.02 → 7471.10] which are heavily endangered,
[7471.26 → 7472.14] but that doesn't get
[7472.14 → 7473.30] one on magazine covers
[7473.30 → 7474.12] and it doesn't get
[7474.12 → 7474.80] one investment.
[7475.04 → 7476.14] So our discussion question
[7476.14 → 7476.44] is,
[7476.94 → 7477.98] noble lies.
[7478.56 → 7479.54] Are we for them
[7479.54 → 7480.74] or against them?
[7481.32 → 7481.72] Against.
[7481.72 → 7481.84] Against.
[7482.24 → 7482.88] Okay, cool.
[7483.64 → 7484.78] That was a quick conversation.
[7485.16 → 7485.62] What's next?
[7486.38 → 7486.78] Yeah.
[7487.92 → 7489.12] The next topic, I think,
[7489.20 → 7490.90] which I think is the last one.
[7491.36 → 7492.04] No, it's not.
[7493.70 → 7495.24] Deny, weeny, many, MOE.
[7495.26 → 7496.24] XT, let's do the XT.
[7496.40 → 7497.56] All right, let's do the XT.
[7497.68 → 7498.74] Turns out the XT
[7498.74 → 7500.48] was inside all of us
[7500.48 → 7501.04] all along.
[7501.04 → 7501.96] Okay, that was not supposed
[7501.96 → 7502.94] to be quite so sensual,
[7503.04 → 7503.96] but do go on.
[7504.14 → 7504.62] It was.
[7505.32 → 7506.82] BIOS modding the 9070
[7506.82 → 7507.58] members of the
[7507.58 → 7509.70] PC Games Hardware Forums
[7509.70 → 7511.44] were successful
[7511.44 → 7513.22] at flashing a 9070
[7513.22 → 7513.88] with the BIOS
[7513.88 → 7515.66] of its superior XT sibling,
[7516.06 → 7517.36] allowing the lesser GPU
[7517.36 → 7518.64] to run at much higher
[7518.64 → 7519.24] clock speeds
[7519.24 → 7520.44] and much higher voltage.
[7520.72 → 7521.50] We're back, baby!
[7521.66 → 7522.24] We used to do this
[7522.24 → 7523.06] kind of stuff back in the day.
[7523.72 → 7524.36] Dodders were able
[7524.36 → 7526.02] to get 15 to 20%
[7526.02 → 7526.94] higher scores
[7526.94 → 7527.72] in 3DMark
[7527.72 → 7529.22] over the stock 9070
[7529.22 → 7531.04] with the unlocked BIOS.
[7531.42 → 7531.80] Naturally,
[7532.02 → 7532.66] this modification
[7532.66 → 7533.54] has its limitations.
[7533.70 → 7534.12] For example,
[7534.12 → 7535.18] it can't make up
[7535.18 → 7536.72] for the missing GPU cores
[7536.72 → 7537.84] and it also prevents
[7537.84 → 7539.34] the card from idling properly
[7539.34 → 7540.14] and apparently
[7540.14 → 7541.76] there are some crashes.
[7542.06 → 7543.20] It says crashes aplenty.
[7543.92 → 7545.42] I've read that some users
[7545.42 → 7546.86] are not running into crashes
[7546.86 → 7547.94] and other users are,
[7548.02 → 7548.32] personally.
[7548.44 → 7548.94] That's what I've read.
[7549.02 → 7550.22] That usually makes sense
[7550.22 → 7550.98] when you're unlocking
[7550.98 → 7552.06] any kind of anything
[7552.06 → 7552.48] on your GPU.
[7552.48 → 7552.90] Yeah, because it's going
[7552.90 → 7553.84] to depend on your card.
[7554.04 → 7555.56] So the crashes aplenty here
[7555.56 → 7556.30] is probably that that's
[7556.30 → 7557.56] happening to a lot of users,
[7557.92 → 7559.00] but there is still a chance
[7559.00 → 7559.72] that you could get lucky
[7559.72 → 7560.44] and have a good card.
[7560.78 → 7561.44] I don't know if there's
[7561.44 → 7562.16] a way to detect
[7562.16 → 7563.82] with binning
[7563.82 → 7564.82] or anything at this time.
[7564.92 → 7565.92] I have no idea.
[7566.08 → 7566.50] I doubt it.
[7566.56 → 7567.34] I doubt it as well.
[7568.02 → 7568.94] Not to mention
[7568.94 → 7570.42] that if you do this
[7570.42 → 7571.10] on a card
[7571.10 → 7572.10] with a dual BIOS,
[7572.38 → 7573.20] you end up
[7573.20 → 7574.76] getting bricked up.
[7574.76 → 7575.78] Without dual BIOS.
[7575.84 → 7576.28] Without, right,
[7576.34 → 7577.04] yeah, that makes more sense.
[7577.06 → 7578.00] Because dual BIOS cards
[7578.00 → 7579.36] you can just flip back
[7579.36 → 7580.30] to your original BIOS
[7580.30 → 7582.12] and if you don't have
[7582.12 → 7582.54] that option,
[7582.64 → 7583.40] it could be
[7583.40 → 7584.60] potentially challenging.
[7584.82 → 7584.90] Yeah.
[7585.32 → 7586.70] This is not the first time
[7586.70 → 7587.48] this has been possible
[7587.48 → 7588.36] on an AMD card.
[7588.50 → 7588.98] It sure isn't.
[7589.28 → 7589.90] You could do this
[7589.90 → 7590.78] with the 6950
[7590.78 → 7591.80] to 6970,
[7592.12 → 7593.08] the Vega 56
[7593.08 → 7593.88] to 64,
[7594.14 → 7595.10] and the 5700
[7595.10 → 7596.90] to the 5700 XT.
[7596.90 → 7597.68] It also used to be
[7597.68 → 7598.96] possible on NVIDIA cards.
[7599.12 → 7599.78] There was a
[7599.82 → 7601.62] what was that card?
[7601.72 → 7603.26] All copper MSI.
[7603.36 → 7603.68] I want to say
[7603.68 → 7604.50] it was a 470.
[7604.50 → 7604.80] Wasn't there more cards
[7604.80 → 7605.14] in this?
[7605.28 → 7607.52] I thought the 290
[7607.52 → 7608.00] or something
[7608.00 → 7609.38] had something going on
[7609.38 → 7610.06] with this as well.
[7610.82 → 7611.84] There's been more
[7611.84 → 7612.96] than just those listed.
[7613.12 → 7613.96] I'm fairly certain.
[7614.46 → 7615.76] This was a really cool card.
[7615.76 → 7617.52] MSI had like a
[7617.52 → 7618.28] like a weird
[7618.28 → 7619.72] all copper cooler,
[7619.90 → 7620.64] twin frozen,
[7621.10 → 7622.34] GTX 465,
[7622.78 → 7624.72] many of which could be,
[7625.00 → 7625.88] they were numbered.
[7626.00 → 7626.92] It was a limited edition.
[7627.16 → 7628.44] NVIDIA needed to just like
[7628.44 → 7629.52] get rid of some GPUs
[7629.52 → 7630.44] back when they were like
[7630.44 → 7632.28] kind of cool and cowboy.
[7633.38 → 7634.42] And so they,
[7634.54 → 7636.10] they were 470s
[7636.10 → 7637.38] that didn't make the cut,
[7637.50 → 7638.42] but some of them
[7638.42 → 7639.86] had all the functional units
[7639.86 → 7640.62] and just were like,
[7640.68 → 7641.02] they didn't meet
[7641.02 → 7641.78] the power profile
[7641.78 → 7642.30] or whatever.
[7642.30 → 7643.98] And so MSI sold them
[7643.98 → 7644.96] as 465s
[7644.96 → 7645.52] and a lot of them
[7645.52 → 7647.20] could be flashed to 470
[7647.20 → 7648.16] and they had this
[7648.16 → 7649.20] super spunky cooler.
[7649.46 → 7649.96] That's cool.
[7650.64 → 7651.22] It looks sick.
[7651.28 → 7651.40] Yeah.
[7651.44 → 7652.06] Bring back cards
[7652.06 → 7652.88] that look like that.
[7653.80 → 7655.14] Our discussion question is,
[7655.18 → 7656.06] would you recommend this?
[7656.16 → 7657.10] My answer is honestly,
[7657.22 → 7657.84] probably no.
[7658.00 → 7658.94] If you have a dual BIOS
[7658.94 → 7660.08] and you want to have some fun.
[7660.18 → 7660.84] Nothing to lose.
[7661.02 → 7661.20] Yeah.
[7661.38 → 7661.56] Yeah.
[7661.64 → 7662.22] Go for it.
[7662.28 → 7662.78] Without it.
[7663.56 → 7664.00] Yeah.
[7665.00 → 7665.80] Little sketch.
[7665.94 → 7666.56] Unless you're willing
[7666.56 → 7667.84] to just like to write the card off,
[7667.90 → 7668.26] basically.
[7668.48 → 7669.02] I wouldn't.
[7670.38 → 7671.54] We need your help
[7671.54 → 7672.06] on a video.
[7672.76 → 7673.44] Source 1
[7673.44 → 7674.78] is for this
[7674.78 → 7675.42] is the need
[7675.42 → 7676.22] for more positivity
[7676.22 → 7676.82] in my life.
[7677.24 → 7678.00] We're a little sick
[7678.00 → 7678.80] of the doom and gloom.
[7679.02 → 7679.74] We're not saying
[7679.74 → 7680.32] the doom and gloom
[7680.32 → 7681.02] isn't warranted.
[7681.08 → 7681.50] We're just saying
[7681.50 → 7682.16] we're sick of it.
[7682.42 → 7683.88] And we want to make a video
[7683.88 → 7684.74] highlighting some
[7684.74 → 7686.72] of your positive moves.
[7686.86 → 7687.06] Oh.
[7687.94 → 7689.80] Or some of the positive moves
[7689.80 → 7691.46] that traditionally greedy companies
[7691.46 → 7692.10] have made
[7692.10 → 7693.20] in the tech space
[7693.20 → 7694.62] and we need your help
[7694.62 → 7695.90] to find the best examples.
[7696.24 → 7696.90] Some examples
[7696.90 → 7697.74] we came up with
[7697.74 → 7699.30] include the open sourcing
[7699.30 → 7700.68] of the Command & Conquer games
[7700.68 → 7701.22] by EA,
[7701.88 → 7702.74] Windows Defender
[7702.74 → 7704.02] making antivirus subscriptions
[7704.02 → 7705.26] mostly a thing of the past,
[7705.42 → 7706.80] and Microsoft's
[7706.80 → 7708.06] accessibility initiatives,
[7708.28 → 7709.14] especially their
[7709.14 → 7710.32] Xbox controller.
[7710.52 → 7711.12] Controllers.
[7711.36 → 7712.04] They have multiple
[7712.04 → 7713.14] accessibility controllers now.
[7713.14 → 7714.02] Let us know
[7714.02 → 7715.92] your favourite positive examples
[7715.92 → 7716.60] in the chat
[7716.60 → 7719.08] or by sending an email.
[7719.44 → 7719.70] Wow.
[7720.76 → 7721.40] Uh...
[7721.40 → 7721.92] Huh.
[7722.94 → 7724.58] Let's go with
[7724.58 → 7727.04] maybe not that email.
[7727.26 → 7728.38] What's a better way to do this?
[7728.84 → 7729.14] Oh, wait.
[7729.22 → 7730.14] Dan can't create
[7730.14 → 7731.22] form posts right now.
[7733.12 → 7734.18] You do it.
[7734.44 → 7734.94] You know what?
[7735.14 → 7736.40] Someone on the Subreddit
[7736.40 → 7737.50] make a thread
[7737.50 → 7738.92] and add things to that.
[7739.02 → 7740.42] I can work on getting logged in.
[7740.48 → 7741.46] Why don't we do that for...
[7741.46 → 7742.20] No, someone will do it.
[7742.28 → 7743.44] They'll be done by the time you...
[7743.44 → 7743.98] But there's going to be
[7743.98 → 7744.82] like a trillion of them.
[7745.98 → 7746.88] That's not my problem.
[7747.10 → 7748.20] Whichever one is
[7748.20 → 7749.54] the one that wins
[7749.54 → 7750.40] is the one.
[7750.94 → 7752.16] Sorry for mods.
[7752.64 → 7753.34] No, no, not the forum.
[7753.48 → 7754.06] The Subreddit.
[7754.60 → 7755.00] Oh.
[7755.14 → 7755.28] Yeah.
[7755.40 → 7755.68] I don't know.
[7755.72 → 7756.66] We don't care about them, do we?
[7758.44 → 7759.90] Well, they're unofficial.
[7760.12 → 7761.00] Reddit will kind of
[7761.00 → 7762.40] sort itself out with upvotes.
[7762.42 → 7762.78] Exactly.
[7762.92 → 7763.88] So it'll probably be okay.
[7763.92 → 7764.46] Yeah, it should be fine.
[7764.56 → 7765.56] If you post on the one
[7765.56 → 7766.32] that doesn't win,
[7766.44 → 7767.44] just migrate it over.
[7767.56 → 7767.72] Yeah.
[7767.96 → 7768.48] Yeah, do that.
[7768.72 → 7768.90] Cool.
[7768.90 → 7769.60] Anywho.
[7769.88 → 7771.34] So yeah, we should do that
[7771.34 → 7773.28] for ideas for gaming experiences
[7773.28 → 7774.02] at Whale land too.
[7774.62 → 7774.82] Yeah.
[7774.88 → 7775.58] So if you have things
[7775.58 → 7776.62] that you'd like want to try,
[7776.74 → 7777.28] like I don't know,
[7777.34 → 7777.88] I think it'd be cool
[7777.88 → 7780.26] to have like a CRT versus OLED
[7780.26 → 7782.02] like retro game station.
[7782.14 → 7782.90] Someone with the Linus account
[7782.90 → 7783.94] added you and said
[7783.94 → 7784.98] I'll make a forum post.
[7787.44 → 7788.96] That's not how we do that.
[7789.22 → 7790.48] Don't log into that.
[7790.48 → 7791.24] That is not how we do that.
[7791.60 → 7792.70] That is really not how we do that.
[7792.70 → 7794.04] You are not supposed to do that.
[7794.36 → 7795.54] I'm going to change the password.
[7795.54 → 7795.98] Okay.
[7796.52 → 7796.88] Anyway.
[7799.86 → 7801.20] Our discussion question is
[7801.20 → 7802.42] can you think of any good guy moves?
[7802.46 → 7803.18] But I think we're just going to
[7803.18 → 7803.86] save it for the video.
[7803.96 → 7804.72] We'll let you guys
[7804.72 → 7806.76] kind of dump them in there.
[7806.88 → 7807.36] Let's go.
[7808.06 → 7809.62] Reddit karma fight says
[7809.62 → 7810.62] Fabienne.
[7812.50 → 7813.90] Elijah, sign into your own account
[7813.90 → 7814.94] for crying out loud.
[7815.64 → 7816.24] Or I won't invite...
[7816.24 → 7816.82] He's posting tomorrow's video.
[7816.92 → 7817.56] He probably just forgot.
[7817.72 → 7818.70] Or I won't invite you
[7818.70 → 7820.24] to play tape to tape.
[7820.68 → 7820.96] Alpha.
[7821.72 → 7822.42] When is it coming?
[7822.66 → 7823.62] I don't know.
[7823.62 → 7825.24] The reason why I messaged you
[7825.24 → 7826.48] was they posted an announcement.
[7827.28 → 7827.68] I know.
[7827.82 → 7829.66] And I read it as like
[7829.66 → 7830.78] this is available now.
[7830.86 → 7831.20] I know.
[7831.88 → 7832.80] They're being...
[7832.80 → 7835.14] Even with like the alpha invitees
[7835.14 → 7836.22] they're being supremely
[7836.22 → 7837.34] c***easy about it.
[7837.46 → 7837.80] Yeah.
[7837.96 → 7839.34] But basically this like...
[7839.34 → 7840.28] It sounds so cool.
[7840.50 → 7841.52] Hockey rogue...
[7841.52 → 7843.68] Super violent hockey roguelike game
[7843.68 → 7844.84] that we've been really enjoying
[7844.84 → 7845.88] over the last little bit.
[7846.26 → 7847.50] It has their like...
[7847.50 → 7849.68] Their like alpha 2.0
[7849.68 → 7850.88] coming very soon.
[7850.96 → 7851.70] I've got an invitation.
[7851.70 → 7854.04] And it like dramatically
[7854.04 → 7855.10] expands the campaign.
[7855.26 → 7856.46] There's now like branching
[7856.46 → 7857.56] paths that you can take.
[7857.66 → 7858.50] I think they've added like
[7858.50 → 7860.02] fighting and a bunch of stuff.
[7860.02 → 7860.54] There are new nodes
[7860.54 → 7861.56] as far as my understanding goes?
[7861.70 → 7863.10] And they've nerfed
[7863.10 → 7863.78] a bunch of the stuff
[7863.78 → 7865.50] that like we acknowledged
[7865.50 → 7866.02] was broken.
[7866.16 → 7867.06] Like the spiked armour.
[7867.64 → 7868.60] Spiked armour makes it
[7868.60 → 7869.86] so that anyone who tries
[7869.86 → 7870.92] to body check you
[7870.92 → 7872.50] gets body checked themselves
[7872.50 → 7874.48] and you just like shrug it off.
[7874.56 → 7875.88] Which is kind of dumb.
[7875.94 → 7876.78] So now it'll be like
[7876.78 → 7877.52] the dragon shout
[7877.52 → 7879.54] where both of you
[7879.54 → 7880.04] will be hit.
[7880.04 → 7882.08] So there's a sacrificial element
[7882.08 → 7882.38] to it.
[7882.38 → 7883.14] If you were going to be hit
[7883.14 → 7884.02] and now the other guy
[7884.02 → 7884.72] is also hit
[7884.72 → 7885.58] sounds good.
[7885.64 → 7886.52] Then now you're both hit.
[7886.64 → 7886.90] Sure.
[7887.10 → 7888.36] That sounds more balanced.
[7888.38 → 7889.08] And they're nerfing
[7889.08 → 7889.58] head redirect
[7889.58 → 7890.74] and like a bunch of other stuff.
[7890.74 → 7891.34] I don't know how
[7891.34 → 7892.10] they're going to nerf it.
[7892.58 → 7893.34] I think they just need
[7893.34 → 7894.12] to remove it from the game.
[7894.30 → 7894.82] We'll see.
[7895.02 → 7895.30] We'll see.
[7895.38 → 7896.62] We'll figure it out.
[7896.76 → 7897.38] We'll figure it out.
[7899.28 → 7900.46] Because even when it was
[7900.46 → 7902.28] completely functionally broken
[7902.28 → 7903.80] it was still overpowered.
[7904.44 → 7904.84] Dan.
[7905.04 → 7905.66] I don't know.
[7905.66 → 7907.94] Are you still not caught up?
[7909.22 → 7910.58] Good lord.
[7910.86 → 7911.60] Check the stats.
[7912.40 → 7914.24] It's slowing down.
[7914.30 → 7915.34] You're doing a great job.
[7915.38 → 7916.64] You're doing a great job sir.
[7917.16 → 7918.22] It's only been two hours.
[7918.22 → 7919.54] And the reason that he needs
[7919.54 → 7920.66] to do a great job
[7920.66 → 7921.80] is because
[7921.80 → 7923.58] we don't want you guys
[7923.58 → 7924.10] to get caught

[8053.12 → 8053.60] holes, but they're

[8188.30 → 8189.30] great hoodie that's
[8189.30 → 8190.70] probably not going to
[8190.70 → 8191.28] be able to be
[8191.28 → 8192.90] manufactured domestically
[8192.90 → 8193.42] ever again
[8193.42 → 8194.44] uh oh dude
[8194.44 → 8195.94] impossible that would
[8195.94 → 8198.08] be like oh my god
[8198.08 → 8198.94] it would be like a
[8198.94 → 8200.16] 500 plus dollar hoodie
[8200.16 → 8204.00] easy like easy um
[8204.00 → 8204.62] and people were
[8204.62 → 8206.36] already like outraged
[8206.36 → 8207.18] that we would have the
[8207.18 → 8208.20] audacity to sell a
[8208.20 → 8209.60] 150 dollar hoodie it's
[8209.60 → 8210.68] like you do realize
[8210.68 → 8212.92] the entire thing is
[8212.92 → 8214.38] embroidered right that
[8214.38 → 8216.12] is not a print that is
[8216.12 → 8217.84] flipping expensive
[8217.84 → 8219.82] internal too uh yeah
[8219.82 → 8220.66] yeah it goes all the
[8220.66 → 8223.38] way through um it's
[8223.38 → 8224.28] not like reversible or
[8224.28 → 8224.96] anything like that I
[8224.96 → 8225.16] don't want to
[8225.16 → 8226.76] misrepresent it it's its
[8226.76 → 8227.48] meant to be viewed from
[8227.48 → 8228.34] the outside but yes it
[8228.34 → 8228.82] goes all the way
[8228.82 → 8230.34] through like your skin
[8230.34 → 8232.38] okay thank you, Dan um
[8232.38 → 8233.70] let's put him away
[8233.70 → 8234.86] okay what do you get
[8234.86 → 8235.34] for us
[8235.34 → 8236.38] to do us
[8236.38 → 8236.90] exposure
[8236.90 → 8240.34] I've been outside
[8240.34 → 8242.02] twice this week it's
[8242.02 → 8243.00] not good for me
[8243.00 → 8244.76] Linus uh you make
[8244.76 → 8245.90] such a big deal about
[8245.90 → 8246.98] finding stuff from the
[8246.98 → 8248.24] office at the tech
[8248.24 → 8249.56] makeovers is that just
[8249.56 → 8251.22] for the loss or are you
[8251.22 → 8253.02] legitimately calling out
[8253.02 → 8253.68] your people
[8253.68 → 8254.50] he's livid
[8254.50 → 8255.68] why not both
[8255.68 → 8256.96] he's livid
[8256.96 → 8258.66] I definitely
[8258.66 → 8260.42] there are definitely
[8260.42 → 8261.54] cases where people
[8261.54 → 8262.50] really aren't supposed
[8262.50 → 8263.44] to have stuff and I
[8263.44 → 8264.30] really do find stuff
[8264.30 → 8265.00] that they're really not
[8265.00 → 8265.72] supposed to have and
[8265.72 → 8266.48] they really do need to
[8266.48 → 8268.04] bring it back but in
[8268.04 → 8269.28] general I don't think
[8269.28 → 8270.72] that I am a particularly
[8270.72 → 8273.88] Draconian Nazi like um
[8273.88 → 8276.10] company owner and if the
[8276.10 → 8277.40] occasional cable that
[8277.40 → 8278.46] especially because a lot
[8278.46 → 8279.18] of the time it's with
[8279.18 → 8280.36] people who kind of need
[8280.36 → 8282.18] to have stuff at their
[8282.18 → 8283.50] house to like do stuff
[8283.50 → 8284.80] off hours, or you know
[8284.80 → 8286.52] whatever else like if is
[8286.52 → 8287.64] or that they brought home
[8287.64 → 8288.46] for a work from home
[8288.46 → 8289.26] station they just like
[8289.26 → 8290.08] kind of forgot about I'm
[8290.08 → 8290.80] not the kind of person
[8290.80 → 8291.40] that's going to be like
[8291.40 → 8292.66] well that's that's a
[8292.66 → 8294.34] citation you know like we
[8294.34 → 8295.02] can have a friendly
[8295.02 → 8296.24] conversation about how
[8296.24 → 8297.26] oh actually we updated
[8297.26 → 8298.10] that policy and you
[8298.10 → 8298.70] actually aren't really
[8298.70 → 8299.30] allowed to do that
[8299.30 → 8300.30] anymore and that's fine
[8300.30 → 8303.66] um and in the case of I
[8303.66 → 8304.68] think Bridget actually
[8304.68 → 8305.92] probably broke the record
[8305.92 → 8307.74] for the most things make
[8307.74 → 8309.70] sense though I mean
[8309.70 → 8311.60] because she seems like
[8311.60 → 8313.70] such a theft person or
[8313.70 → 8315.22] no it's a good job
[8315.22 → 8316.22] because she's the head of
[8316.22 → 8317.96] fashion and so as part of
[8317.96 → 8320.22] her job she actually brings
[8320.22 → 8321.68] home for feedback and wear
[8321.68 → 8322.96] testing and long-term
[8322.96 → 8324.98] evaluation a lot of CW
[8324.98 → 8326.28] product you want her to
[8326.28 → 8327.56] do and I even told her
[8327.56 → 8328.14] this I don't think it
[8328.14 → 8329.70] made it to on camera but
[8329.70 → 8331.04] honestly I would have
[8331.04 → 8332.16] been more disappointed in
[8332.16 → 8333.78] her if she and her
[8333.78 → 8335.66] husband didn't wear our
[8335.66 → 8337.46] merchandise like I don't
[8337.46 → 8338.96] think you should force all
[8338.96 → 8340.26] the executives at Ford to
[8340.26 → 8341.86] drive Fords ideally you
[8341.86 → 8342.68] should be proud of what
[8342.68 → 8343.38] you made, but you'd be
[8343.38 → 8346.18] pretty damn excited if they
[8346.18 → 8347.44] chose to drive Ford was
[8347.44 → 8348.38] that a specific reference
[8348.38 → 8349.24] because the CEO doesn't
[8349.24 → 8350.34] drive a Ford I don't know
[8350.34 → 8351.88] no he doesn't yeah it
[8351.88 → 8353.44] makes sense he drives some
[8353.44 → 8354.48] Chinese maker I don't
[8354.48 → 8355.20] remember which one yeah
[8355.20 → 8356.44] so like that's the thing
[8356.44 → 8358.06] is like if our
[8358.06 → 8359.68] products should be good
[8359.68 → 8361.36] enough that are everyone
[8361.36 → 8364.60] from our CEO to literally
[8364.60 → 8365.98] the person who just
[8365.98 → 8367.18] started their first day
[8367.18 → 8368.48] should be proud and
[8368.48 → 8370.04] comfortable to wear them
[8370.04 → 8371.58] and anything other than
[8371.58 → 8373.10] that is not good enough so
[8373.10 → 8375.40] so yeah no I told her I
[8375.40 → 8376.26] would have been I would
[8376.26 → 8377.22] have been much more upset
[8377.22 → 8378.06] if she hadn't taken
[8378.06 → 8380.44] anything she has one of
[8380.44 → 8381.12] the Luxe backpack
[8381.12 → 8382.20] prototypes in a different
[8382.20 → 8384.72] colour she was like I can
[8384.72 → 8385.92] justify this I can justify
[8385.92 → 8388.94] this you took one Yvonne
[8388.94 → 8390.16] took one, and I took one
[8390.16 → 8391.62] for long-term testing I'm
[8391.62 → 8395.40] not done testing it she's a
[8395.40 → 8397.68] hoot Bridget long form
[8397.68 → 8398.88] apple leather test or
[8398.88 → 8401.96] whatever nice all right
[8401.96 → 8403.54] what else you got for me
[8403.54 → 8405.30] Dan why can't the free
[8405.30 → 8406.96] shipping be rounded or just
[8406.96 → 8408.48] let me round up everything
[8408.48 → 8410.44] is x99, so I ended up four
[8410.44 → 8411.98] cents short, so I dropped
[8411.98 → 8412.86] one order then picked
[8412.86 → 8415.00] another, and then I was 10
[8415.00 → 8417.36] oh four short whatever
[8417.36 → 8419.62] I'll explain it
[8419.62 → 8422.86] capitalism I'll explain it
[8422.86 → 8423.80] current year
[8423.80 → 8427.88] because I really need to not
[8427.88 → 8431.24] lose money egregiously on
[8431.24 → 8433.44] every transaction god you
[8433.44 → 8435.34] really are a bad person I
[8435.34 → 8437.44] know I know I have to
[8437.44 → 8439.60] pay people like Bridget I have
[8439.60 → 8441.02] to pay I have to pay we
[8441.02 → 8442.16] complain Bridget because she's
[8442.16 → 8443.80] stealing all of your stuff
[8443.80 → 8445.16] eating into your bottom line
[8445.16 → 8446.76] it's true yeah do you have any
[8446.76 → 8447.98] idea how much a sample cost
[8447.98 → 8449.14] compared to like the mass
[8449.14 → 8452.44] production oh my god I not a
[8452.44 → 8453.82] joke because so much of my
[8453.82 → 8455.66] wardrobe is early samples like
[8455.66 → 8456.70] the cargo pants I'm wearing
[8456.70 → 8457.44] right now check this out
[8457.44 → 8459.44] hold on
[8459.44 → 8460.44] hold on
[8460.44 → 8465.52] here yeah okay watch this
[8465.52 → 8466.56] watch this water bottles in the
[8466.56 → 8468.08] way okay so we got an oh
[8468.08 → 8468.80] balls
[8468.80 → 8472.12] lttstore.com okay, so I got my
[8472.12 → 8473.68] phone in here okay so
[8473.68 → 8474.86] normally right I should be able
[8474.86 → 8475.88] to pull my phone out like this
[8475.88 → 8476.08] right
[8476.08 → 8478.44] okay but watch this
[8478.44 → 8485.44] see my phone yeah there this
[8485.44 → 8487.34] one doesn't have the
[8487.34 → 8489.18] pocket so the pocket bag sewn
[8489.18 → 8489.74] properly
[8489.74 → 8492.76] that's the kind of stuff that we
[8492.76 → 8494.18] travel that's the kind of stuff
[8494.18 → 8495.52] that we catch on pre-production
[8495.52 → 8498.30] stuff and because I wear test it
[8498.30 → 8498.80] myself
[8498.80 → 8502.58] I am have the pleasure of making
[8502.58 → 8503.70] sure doesn't make it to the
[8503.70 → 8505.62] finished product for you and be
[8505.62 → 8507.04] have the displeasure of because I
[8507.04 → 8508.26] don't like wasting and throwing
[8508.26 → 8511.00] things away continuing to have
[8511.00 → 8511.70] to deal with
[8511.70 → 8513.68] part of the whole joke is the
[8513.68 → 8515.36] the biggest dealer of company
[8515.36 → 8517.66] property is Linus oh it's not
[8517.66 → 8519.20] even close yeah yeah it's not
[8519.20 → 8520.44] even close that's part of the
[8520.44 → 8522.42] whole thing is that it's its
[8522.42 → 8524.20] yeah I think I've I think I've
[8524.20 → 8526.54] caught a few moments when
[8526.54 → 8527.98] watching those when I see an
[8527.98 → 8529.84] actual amount of like what the
[8529.84 → 8531.86] heck yeah usually you're just
[8531.86 → 8533.28] playing it happens that's why I
[8533.28 → 8534.62] said it's a little bit of both
[8534.62 → 8535.54] yeah yeah but
[8535.54 → 8538.68] yeah so these cargo pants
[8538.68 → 8540.70] so like I it's its so funny
[8540.70 → 8543.86] because I dress like just a
[8543.86 → 8544.66] self theft if he owns the
[8544.66 → 8544.98] company
[8544.98 → 8546.78] actually it is actually it is
[8546.78 → 8548.42] oh yeah I dress like a just
[8548.42 → 8550.40] random gamer bro for the most part
[8550.40 → 8551.88] I wear t-shirts hoodies you know
[8551.88 → 8554.78] like I this is me this
[8554.78 → 8555.86] is me this is how I dress
[8555.86 → 8556.90] regardless of whether I worked
[8556.90 → 8557.14] here
[8557.14 → 8561.58] but in terms of how much my
[8561.58 → 8565.68] wardrobe actually cost oh absurd
[8565.68 → 8567.34] it's like yeah yeah yeah I could
[8567.34 → 8569.04] be buying all the designer labels
[8569.04 → 8572.10] because most of my stuff is like
[8572.10 → 8573.96] one-offs essentially you're wearing
[8573.96 → 8575.34] a ten thousand dollar pair of
[8575.34 → 8577.26] pants they're not even like sewn
[8577.26 → 8577.70] properly
[8577.70 → 8580.76] not that much not that much but
[8580.76 → 8582.48] hundreds of dollars a lot oh yeah
[8582.48 → 8584.00] yeah yeah and if you have the
[8584.00 → 8586.34] pants and the socks and I don't
[8586.34 → 8588.86] know maybe some footwear someday this
[8588.86 → 8590.36] is why you walk into Tiffany and
[8590.36 → 8593.16] clothes you made yourself right all of
[8593.16 → 8596.04] all of my clothes are bespoke you know
[8596.04 → 8600.58] oh right yeah so it's a baller it's
[8600.58 → 8603.06] it's hilarious though because I
[8603.06 → 8604.96] literally can be standing next to
[8604.96 → 8607.08] someone who's wearing the exact same
[8607.08 → 8610.14] clothing as me but mine cost five to
[8610.14 → 8612.86] ten times as much and might be worse
[8612.86 → 8614.30] which if you think about it which is
[8614.30 → 8615.80] you think about it is kind of the
[8615.80 → 8617.60] whole thing right like people will buy
[8617.60 → 8619.34] that oh yeah yeah yeah plain white
[8619.34 → 8620.84] t-shirt for three hundred dollars or
[8620.84 → 8621.92] whatever just so that they can know
[8621.92 → 8624.36] they did, so I'm like the stealthiest
[8624.36 → 8626.96] like high-end clothing wearer of all
[8626.96 → 8628.90] time you're a fashion bro apparently
[8628.90 → 8631.02] apparently a streetwear icon one
[8631.02 → 8633.02] would say I have no one would say that
[8633.02 → 8636.08] it's a very good way like that's a
[8636.08 → 8637.84] like life hack if you want custom
[8637.84 → 8640.82] clothes samples oh god commit a little
[8640.82 → 8643.62] fraud yeah I don't even know if it
[8643.62 → 8646.08] counts as fraud it's just using the
[8646.08 → 8647.96] system yeah no you could tell
[8647.96 → 8649.36] a factory that you have like an intent
[8649.36 → 8651.14] they won't really do a ton of like real
[8651.14 → 8653.10] work for you if you don't prove that
[8653.10 → 8654.62] you are like actually capable of
[8654.62 → 8656.66] ordering mass production stuff but they
[8656.66 → 8658.34] might say they might make you a one of
[8658.34 → 8660.14] something you never know you could
[8660.14 → 8662.52] repeat the grift at multiple factories
[8662.52 → 8664.10] I'm not saying to do that I don't I
[8664.10 → 8665.60] don't advocate for wasting people's
[8665.60 → 8668.18] time but conceivably yeah you could get
[8668.18 → 8669.56] something made one-off you could also
[8669.56 → 8671.20] just get stuff made one-off overseas
[8671.20 → 8672.80] pretty easily as long as you don't live
[8672.80 → 8675.00] in the US, and it's going to get ta riffed
[8675.00 → 8677.16] like Yvonne had her wedding dress made
[8677.16 → 8679.70] one-off yeah that's cool she ended up
[8679.70 → 8681.26] having to get a second one because the
[8681.26 → 8683.60] first one was a disaster but then that
[8683.60 → 8685.10] second is the second one one-off she
[8685.10 → 8687.76] ended up selling for so much more than
[8687.76 → 8689.22] what she paid that it covered the cost
[8689.22 → 8690.38] of both the first one and the second
[8690.38 → 8691.68] one and both were one-off were they from
[8691.68 → 8693.40] the same place no I don't think so that
[8693.40 → 8695.96] makes sense yeah so it took her to two
[8695.96 → 8697.58] attempts to get a wedding dress that she
[8697.58 → 8698.98] could actually wear it was beautiful
[8698.98 → 8700.92] though it's pretty sweet yeah this is a
[8700.92 → 8702.42] little-known fact, but you can actually
[8702.42 → 8706.30] find my our wedding video on YouTube
[8706.30 → 8710.20] yeah we uploaded it not really sure how
[8710.20 → 8716.14] long I will leave it up right I've seen
[8716.14 → 8719.50] this, but it's been a long time I really
[8719.50 → 8720.78] hope it starts at the Windows Movie
[8720.78 → 8722.66] Maker this is oh dude this is some
[8722.66 → 8725.38] Windows Movie Maker stuff right ironic
[8725.38 → 8728.14] it wasn't Sony Vegas was it ironic no it
[8728.14 → 8729.94] is Windows Movie Maker because that's
[8729.94 → 8731.62] what Yvonne had to use I don't think it
[8731.62 → 8733.82] was ironic, and she was the one here she
[8733.82 → 8736.32] was the one who made it so she used
[8736.32 → 8738.04] whatever software she knew how to use this
[8738.04 → 8740.20] is I mean that is so much better this is
[8740.20 → 8742.62] 2011 like a lot of YouTube videos were
[8742.62 → 8746.98] yeah yeah buddy oh yeah buddy oh good
[8746.98 → 8748.56] the music's off because it is definitely
[8748.56 → 8752.84] some copyrighted music oh my goodness
[8752.84 → 8754.66] baby does he look old enough to get
[8754.66 → 8756.50] married no to be honest I don't really
[8756.50 → 8760.50] think, so I don't really think so pretty
[8760.50 → 8762.84] pretty magic day pretty magic day buddies
[8762.84 → 8767.40] let's go anyway so that's up there
[8767.40 → 8769.56] if you're a weird creep, and you want to
[8769.56 → 8770.00] watch it
[8770.00 → 8773.88] is it like how much does it bother you
[8773.88 → 8775.48] knowing that someone has that backed up
[8775.48 → 8777.90] on a server somewhere like an individual
[8777.90 → 8781.56] not Google yeah yeah it doesn't really
[8781.56 → 8784.58] matter I mean it's there's nothing I like
[8784.58 → 8786.32] I talk about this a lot when we
[8786.32 → 8788.70] discuss like privacy topics where it's
[8788.70 → 8790.30] like yeah it's not too late for you, you're
[8790.30 → 8792.16] compromised already you can keep your you
[8792.16 → 8793.94] can keep your personal information safe
[8793.94 → 8796.42] still I am dude I'm done I've had that
[8796.42 → 8797.98] conversation people too because I'm
[8797.98 → 8799.98] cooked I talk about caring privacy
[8799.98 → 8801.82] and stuff a lot and then people are like
[8801.82 → 8803.74] but you're so public I'm like yeah
[8803.74 → 8806.70] because I already lost yeah I mean the
[8806.70 → 8808.40] war is over for everyone I used to I
[8808.40 → 8809.98] used to bother to change my phone number
[8809.98 → 8812.26] when it leaked yeah I haven't bothered in
[8812.26 → 8814.42] years that probably wasn't smart to say
[8814.42 → 8816.66] but yeah well it doesn't matter because
[8816.66 → 8819.22] I don't I don't take calls yeah I
[8819.22 → 8820.78] literally just don't answer calls so it
[8820.78 → 8822.86] doesn't matter yeah and also I just
[8822.86 → 8824.30] switched to a pixel which has that cool
[8824.30 → 8826.20] call screening feature, so I especially
[8826.20 → 8829.60] don't take calls like I love that
[8829.60 → 8832.28] feature yeah I will never go to another
[8832.28 → 8834.20] phone that doesn't have it like it don't
[8834.20 → 8836.90] be don't easy don't be an idiot and think
[8836.90 → 8838.10] you're going to like call me, and I'm gonna
[8838.10 → 8839.50] talk to you that's like not how that
[8839.50 → 8841.00] works you're just you are literally
[8841.00 → 8842.74] spamming me and bothering me that's
[8842.74 → 8844.70] that's not how you start a that's not
[8844.70 → 8846.82] how you kick off a relationship just if
[8846.82 → 8848.06] they don't make it through the call
[8848.06 → 8849.30] screen you just block the number yeah
[8849.30 → 8851.42] no exactly obvious and so it's one of
[8851.42 → 8853.32] those things where to me like I just
[8853.32 → 8856.12] had a just had like sort of an an a
[8856.12 → 8858.84] reality check where I was like oh okay
[8858.84 → 8860.90] well yeah this doesn't have this doesn't
[8860.90 → 8865.74] really matter um whatever like there was
[8865.74 → 8868.14] a YouTuber who was working on a like
[8868.14 → 8871.22] getting celebrity contact info video a
[8871.22 → 8872.98] while back I wonder if that video ever
[8872.98 → 8874.78] came out I don't know anyway sure it
[8874.78 → 8876.24] was incredibly easy to get yours they
[8876.24 → 8878.54] were like oh yeah uh well they saw
[8878.54 → 8879.80] me in person they were like hey can I
[8879.80 → 8881.42] get your phone number I was like I mean
[8881.42 → 8883.40] sure it's nothing special you could get
[8883.40 → 8885.38] it is like easy, and they're like what do
[8885.38 → 8886.64] you mean I'm like oh well you could just
[8886.64 → 8888.38] go and like rocket reach and like look
[8888.38 → 8890.36] it up I think their subscriptions like
[8890.36 → 8892.10] five dollars or something like that he's
[8892.10 → 8893.36] like whoa why are you telling people
[8893.36 → 8894.74] that I'm like dude it's not a secret
[8894.74 → 8897.02] you literally just you can like google
[8897.02 → 8900.08] like freaking Bill Gates phone number and
[8900.08 → 8902.66] you can like to look it up like space
[8902.66 → 8904.70] gamer said wait what can my pixel do the
[8904.70 → 8906.50] best feature that pixel has and some
[8906.50 → 8907.70] other phones have this as far as my
[8907.70 → 8910.52] understanding goes but the best feature
[8910.52 → 8912.86] that pixel has in my opinion is call
[8912.86 → 8914.42] screening and when someone calls you
[8914.42 → 8917.12] there will be a little button there that
[8917.12 → 8919.84] says screen call and if you press it is
[8919.84 → 8923.72] will answer the call, but it's a Google
[8923.72 → 8925.94] voice and the Google voice says oh the
[8925.94 → 8929.26] person that you are calling to reach has a
[8929.26 → 8931.50] call screening feature state your name and
[8931.50 → 8933.60] your business and say who you are and
[8933.60 → 8935.52] what you want, and then it will output
[8935.52 → 8938.40] their answer through transcribed text so
[8938.40 → 8940.46] you can read it without answering the
[8940.46 → 8943.08] call and then if you don't like it you
[8943.08 → 8945.36] just click hang up, and then you have
[8945.36 → 8947.74] never actually answered the call and then
[8947.74 → 8949.82] you just block them got him or what
[8949.82 → 8952.56] happens most of the time is it's like a
[8952.56 → 8954.10] call centre or something like that they
[8954.10 → 8956.32] hit the call screening they hang up yep
[8956.32 → 8958.18] you need to never have to deal with
[8958.18 → 8961.60] asks is Linus a celebrity I told him no I
[8961.60 → 8965.02] I was like I don't think I count so maybe
[8965.02 → 8966.82] that's why you guys never saw that
[8966.82 → 8967.08] video
[8967.08 → 8973.60] um all right yeah I mean the spam calling
[8973.60 → 8977.24] is insane I get spam calls all the time
[8977.24 → 8979.12] and I don't, and it doesn't even matter if
[8979.12 → 8980.98] you've leaked your number it matters
[8980.98 → 8982.62] because so many numbers are recycled
[8982.62 → 8985.08] now yes so it matters whatever happened
[8985.08 → 8986.90] to whoever had your number before
[8986.90 → 8990.32] realistically like I there's one person
[8990.32 → 8991.66] who has one of my old numbers who
[8991.66 → 8993.30] apparently gets really mad at people if
[8993.30 → 8996.10] they call them if he's a tech guy then
[8996.10 → 8997.82] he should have updated his contact list
[8997.82 → 8999.54] properly like if they apparently like
[8999.54 → 9001.30] chewed out someone that called him I was
[9001.30 → 9004.62] like I don't know like nice that's a
[9004.62 → 9006.50] that's definitely necessary yeah that's
[9006.50 → 9008.80] definitely constructive yeah okay for
[9008.80 → 9013.46] sure, sure good job um all right Dan
[9013.46 → 9016.94] Linus you're into Japanese style RPGs a
[9016.94 → 9019.04] true man of culture what do you feel are
[9019.04 → 9021.30] the primary hurdles for the genre to
[9021.30 → 9024.16] overcome becoming mainstream are these
[9024.16 → 9026.78] hurdles for gamers or developers I mean
[9026.78 → 9031.26] with how I oh man I would make the
[9031.26 → 9034.74] argument that a are mainstream and
[9034.74 → 9038.40] b they are as mainstream as anything will
[9038.40 → 9041.86] ever be again in gaming has
[9041.86 → 9049.60] become this fragmented collection of sub sub
[9049.60 → 9056.30] sub-genres to the point where you could play you
[9056.30 → 9058.62] could you could play you could spend all of
[9058.62 → 9063.56] your off work sleep time for an entire year just
[9063.56 → 9067.76] playing video games and if you played them through to completion every time you
[9067.76 → 9086.60] could probably not touch 10 percent of the sub-genres out there so with that in mind I I I I I I I I I I I don't think it needs to hit me there's something for everyone and I think it's about as mainstream as anything will ever be again if that is you kind of if that kind of makes sense like I don't think anything's mainstream I don't think we're ever going to have
[9086.60 → 9087.44] Fortnite?
[9087.44 → 9089.26] Like what would I, yeah, I-
[9089.26 → 9090.82] Minecraft? Roblox?
[9090.82 → 9092.26] Those are kids specific though,
[9092.26 → 9093.14] like can we get something that's not-
[9093.14 → 9094.48] Fortnite's not kids specific.
[9094.48 → 9095.32] Okay, I get it.
[9095.32 → 9096.16] Minecraft is not kids specific.
[9096.16 → 9097.00] Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[9097.00 → 9100.16] But in terms of the cultural impact though,
[9100.16 → 9101.44] I wanted to go back farther.
[9101.44 → 9102.96] Fortnite was everyone, dude.
[9102.96 → 9104.46] Hold on, hold on, can I go back farther?
[9104.46 → 9105.36] I wanted to go back farther.
[9105.36 → 9108.72] I don't think we're going to have like a Tetris
[9108.72 → 9112.24] where literally an entire generation of gamers
[9112.24 → 9114.46] has absolutely played that game.
[9114.46 → 9117.60] Well, maybe it's because they bundled it
[9117.60 → 9119.96] with the Game Boy, Nintendo.
[9119.96 → 9123.50] Weird how there's a pattern of this being successful.
[9123.50 → 9124.66] Fix it!
[9124.66 → 9127.70] God, it's really frustrating, and I'm sure,
[9127.70 → 9130.06] I'm a hundred percent sure people have seen this
[9130.06 → 9132.96] with me, you, this company as a whole, whatever.
[9132.96 → 9135.26] It's really frustrating when you see another group,
[9135.26 → 9136.92] another person, another company, whatever,
[9136.92 → 9141.32] fumble something that would seem so obvious
[9141.32 → 9142.68] from the outside.
[9142.68 → 9144.94] Hold on, Ninja Man Away says,
[9144.94 → 9146.42] excuse the fuck out of you,
[9146.42 → 9147.76] Minecraft is not kids specific.
[9147.76 → 9149.12] Sorry, I mis phrased that.
[9149.12 → 9153.14] What I meant was that it was generationally
[9153.14 → 9156.94] not far enough back that literally like everyone
[9156.94 → 9158.88] in that entire cohort played it.
[9158.88 → 9160.90] There were lots of people that would have considered
[9160.90 → 9164.14] themselves, you know, not gonna play Minecraft
[9164.14 → 9165.52] and just would have never touched it.
[9165.52 → 9167.86] I never got into it until my kids got me into it.
[9169.42 → 9171.44] And I didn't even really get into it,
[9171.46 → 9173.32] but like, I can like to know how to do it now.
[9173.34 → 9175.30] I don't think you can do Tetris again
[9175.30 → 9176.86] because there are too many games.
[9177.26 → 9179.38] That's, that is exactly the point I was trying to make
[9179.38 → 9181.68] and Minecraft wouldn't have made that point for me.
[9182.06 → 9183.56] Fortnite wouldn't have made that point for me.
[9183.72 → 9185.58] It's the same thing with music in my opinion.
[9185.72 → 9187.52] I don't think you can be the Beatles again.
[9188.48 → 9188.84] Yeah.
[9188.96 → 9190.12] I don't think that could happen.
[9190.34 → 9190.54] Yeah.
[9190.68 → 9191.64] I don't, I don't think so either.
[9191.64 → 9193.66] I don't think anyone can have the cultural impact
[9193.66 → 9194.88] of Elvis Presley again.
[9195.00 → 9195.22] Yeah.
[9196.00 → 9196.60] 100%.
[9196.60 → 9198.12] Yeah.
[9200.50 → 9204.10] Since NVIDIA no longer supports Game Stream on The Shield,
[9204.36 → 9207.28] is there a good alternative to stream from a PC to a TV
[9207.28 → 9210.10] in another room without running additional cables
[9210.10 → 9211.32] besides existing network cables?
[9211.34 → 9212.14] Moonlight, Steam Link.
[9212.72 → 9213.18] Steam Link.
[9213.88 → 9215.56] A lot of TVs will have apps for,
[9215.76 → 9216.84] well, no, the TV will have an app.
[9217.42 → 9219.54] Oh, what if you don't have a TV?
[9219.54 → 9222.90] Wasn't the question to do with TVs?
[9223.98 → 9225.40] What if there's a dumb TV?
[9226.00 → 9226.92] Or you have a projector?
[9232.46 → 9233.36] A laptop?
[9233.48 → 9234.54] Well, you could still run,
[9234.72 → 9236.44] you could still run Steam Link on The Shield.
[9237.64 → 9238.32] That, hmm.
[9239.86 → 9240.28] Okay.
[9241.18 → 9242.32] It's a solvable problem.
[9242.84 → 9243.80] This is mainly for Luke,
[9243.94 → 9246.36] but have you guys heard about the 4K77,
[9246.36 → 9249.34] 4K80, and 4K83 projects
[9249.34 → 9252.50] where they restored the original Star Wars theatrical releases
[9252.50 → 9253.90] pre-special editions.
[9254.18 → 9255.68] They are a great watch.
[9256.44 → 9256.56] Oh.
[9256.80 → 9257.80] Why was this mainly for me?
[9258.18 → 9259.28] Well, yeah, I'm down.
[9259.42 → 9259.98] I love it.
[9260.02 → 9260.46] I'm excited.
[9260.84 → 9261.22] But this is...
[9261.22 → 9263.18] Dude, we have owed...
[9263.18 → 9264.80] I have not heard of this whole...
[9264.80 → 9265.20] What is this?
[9265.36 → 9265.70] Luke.
[9266.02 → 9266.42] What's up?
[9266.42 → 9269.42] We still haven't done our Star Wars stream.
[9269.42 → 9272.60] What was it again?
[9272.64 → 9274.64] We promised to do it like 10 years ago.
[9274.78 → 9277.20] I think we were gonna just like watch Star Wars
[9277.20 → 9278.06] and dunk on it.
[9278.30 → 9279.10] The prequels, right?
[9279.44 → 9280.32] Or was it all of it?
[9280.82 → 9281.36] I think...
[9281.36 → 9282.28] I don't remember.
[9282.84 → 9283.86] I think it was all of it.
[9283.90 → 9285.98] I think we were supposed to watch all nine movies
[9285.98 → 9287.16] with commentary.
[9289.26 → 9290.66] How do we do it?
[9290.82 → 9291.18] Oh, sorry.
[9291.36 → 9293.46] Sunshine is apparently a good alternative to Moonlight.
[9294.10 → 9295.02] Yeah, I heard about that.
[9295.28 → 9295.40] Yeah.
[9295.50 → 9295.68] Yeah.
[9295.82 → 9296.08] Okay.
[9296.08 → 9301.14] Dude, doing it with this.
[9301.64 → 9304.78] No, because the whole point of it was that we were going to dunk on it
[9304.78 → 9306.78] and like talk about all the stuff that's stupid about it.
[9308.02 → 9308.78] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9308.80 → 9310.84] But I don't think this like changes the plot or anything.
[9310.90 → 9311.88] It's just like a...
[9311.88 → 9312.76] It's not a fan edit.
[9312.92 → 9314.36] It's the real deal start to finish.
[9314.48 → 9314.98] Works and all.
[9315.56 → 9318.62] Not as pristine as specialized, but totally authentic.
[9320.08 → 9321.04] Oh, interesting.
[9323.16 → 9324.48] Where do you get it?
[9324.58 → 9325.26] Is it like...
[9325.26 → 9326.44] But it's like the original cut.
[9326.44 → 9328.86] So like Han shoots Greed and stuff, right?
[9328.92 → 9329.26] I'm assuming.
[9329.52 → 9330.32] I would hope so.
[9330.66 → 9331.88] I think that's the point.
[9332.00 → 9334.10] Is it's like the original cut, but really nice.
[9335.04 → 9336.02] I could be wrong.
[9336.30 → 9339.00] That's what I got from it so far though.
[9339.12 → 9339.78] So, sorry.
[9339.86 → 9340.58] Where do you get them?
[9340.70 → 9343.22] Is this just like a torrent thing or is it like...
[9343.22 → 9343.88] I have no idea.
[9344.88 → 9345.74] Yeah, I don't know.
[9345.88 → 9348.48] The Reddit thread doesn't actually say anything about...
[9348.48 → 9350.58] There's a sample of the opening scene.
[9351.46 → 9353.10] Yeah, we're not going to be watching that on stream.
[9353.10 → 9354.52] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9354.62 → 9355.60] But you can find it.
[9356.40 → 9357.68] Originaltrilogy.com.
[9358.80 → 9360.06] Something, something, something.
[9360.36 → 9362.66] Should Disney do the right thing and release a 4K version?
[9362.74 → 9365.40] I thought that was part of their deal with Lucas though, that they couldn't do it.
[9366.32 → 9370.32] Like they would only ever release the garbage versions.
[9370.68 → 9371.62] And then they would...
[9371.62 → 9375.38] I guess part of the deal was also to make the new stuff more garbage than before.
[9377.90 → 9379.88] I will do my best to keep the page up to date.
[9379.98 → 9380.78] Here's a forum thing.
[9380.84 → 9381.82] Yeah, I don't know, man.
[9381.82 → 9382.74] I...
[9382.74 → 9386.08] I have no idea like where to get this stuff.
[9387.70 → 9388.34] All right.
[9389.24 → 9389.86] Well, anyway.
[9390.46 → 9396.72] So is watching the no DNR version of 4K77 just like watching the film in theatres in 1977?
[9397.24 → 9400.44] Not 100% no, but pretty close is their answer.
[9400.88 → 9401.00] Yeah.
[9401.62 → 9402.48] That's pretty cool.
[9402.58 → 9403.36] That is pretty cool.
[9404.28 → 9405.14] Yeah, I mean, I'm down.
[9406.08 → 9406.80] I'm down.
[9406.92 → 9407.18] I'm down.
[9407.20 → 9407.60] What do we do?
[9407.68 → 9413.68] Do we just put like a timestamp on screen, and then they can't see or hear the movie?
[9413.88 → 9415.50] Yeah, I think you'd have to like...
[9415.50 → 9417.48] And we'd have to just talk over it and not pause it.
[9417.48 → 9417.94] So they watch along, yeah.
[9418.04 → 9418.72] So you would just like...
[9418.72 → 9419.72] It would be like a watch along.
[9419.86 → 9420.04] Yeah.
[9420.40 → 9420.56] Yeah.
[9420.56 → 9424.04] That's very like Mystery Science Theatre 3000, but...
[9424.04 → 9425.72] Except you don't actually see the movie.
[9425.92 → 9426.62] So you'd have to...
[9426.62 → 9426.72] Yeah.
[9427.42 → 9427.62] Yeah.
[9427.74 → 9428.24] Like be sweet.
[9428.36 → 9430.10] We could even just like have like...
[9430.10 → 9430.38] We could.
[9430.38 → 9433.44] We could even have just like a...
[9433.44 → 9434.46] And how would we do this?
[9435.82 → 9440.02] So we could make it so that it's like kind of intended for you to watch on PC, and we like
[9440.02 → 9443.34] leave a little spot in the corner in our framing where you can kind of like to put the movie.
[9443.76 → 9445.50] Or maybe to put us or something.
[9445.70 → 9445.96] I don't know.
[9446.10 → 9446.20] I think us.
[9446.20 → 9449.06] So I don't think there's going to be a lot of us to like to see.
[9449.20 → 9449.42] Yeah.
[9449.50 → 9451.02] Maybe we won't have to do anything like that.
[9451.14 → 9451.34] Yeah.
[9451.38 → 9451.82] Watch Party.
[9451.96 → 9452.28] Let's go.
[9453.18 → 9453.48] Okay.
[9455.48 → 9456.64] Hi, Wans haw.
[9456.70 → 9459.26] Maybe a weird question, but why does my package...
[9460.16 → 9460.98] Oh boy!
[9460.98 → 9467.92] Go to the US first and then to Germany where it gets transferred to another company to reach
[9467.92 → 9468.56] South America.
[9468.88 → 9470.00] What a great question.
[9470.16 → 9474.62] So it goes to the US first because we use a shipping consolidator called Wish.
[9474.62 → 9480.86] Wish because if we actually ship using Canadian couriers from a Canadian address literally
[9480.86 → 9488.14] anywhere, it costs way more for, in many cases, not even a better experience.
[9489.38 → 9492.40] Shipping from Canada sucks bananas.
[9492.68 → 9493.24] Oh yeah, it's terrible.
[9493.44 → 9497.52] As for why it goes to Germany and then gets transferred to another company to reach South
[9497.52 → 9497.72] America.
[9497.72 → 9498.02] That's wild.
[9498.02 → 9498.58] South America.
[9498.58 → 9506.18] That is because there's major hubs where they consolidate shipments and the math behind
[9506.18 → 9510.34] it is far more complicated than I will ever understand, but that's the most efficient way
[9510.34 → 9511.26] to do it, apparently.
[9511.90 → 9512.54] It's stupid.
[9513.12 → 9513.40] Yeah.
[9513.58 → 9514.78] Doesn't make a lot of sense.
[9514.80 → 9517.90] It seems awfully ridiculous, but that is not uncommon.
[9518.26 → 9519.68] It also does make sense.
[9520.62 → 9523.00] Josh Craft 3D asks, will tariffs affect Wish?
[9523.28 → 9524.06] Of course.
[9525.58 → 9528.20] And someone asks, does that mean everyone will get American tariffs?
[9528.20 → 9530.24] No, we won't be able to ship through the US anymore.
[9530.72 → 9532.78] So we have a lot of stuff to figure out on our side.
[9532.98 → 9534.22] Or, or hear me out.
[9534.62 → 9535.28] Hear me out.
[9535.48 → 9539.36] If you don't want to get caught in the ship storm, we are doing an incredible promo on
[9539.36 → 9543.22] LTT Store right now where you can get free shipping on all orders over $150.
[9543.74 → 9546.80] All you got to do is go to LTTStore.com and click shop now.
[9547.00 → 9549.48] Look at this great deal on the MCM Essentials solution.
[9549.60 → 9553.00] Just $79.99 for all of this cable managing goodness.
[9553.00 → 9558.54] And to make sure you top up your cart to reach that free worldwide shipping threshold, you
[9558.54 → 9563.58] could pick up a commuter backpack or a screwdriver or a different backpack or a tech sack or all
[9563.58 → 9564.94] any of these great items.
[9565.04 → 9565.64] We've got pens.
[9565.76 → 9569.00] We've got, oh, look at that framework embroidered hoodie, just like producer Dan wears.
[9569.20 → 9569.98] Look at him go.
[9572.84 → 9573.78] All right, Dan, hit me.
[9573.96 → 9574.08] Sure.
[9574.08 → 9580.26] Now that you've seen someone do the land gaming house better than you.
[9581.54 → 9583.82] Do you think you can revisit it for a budget?
[9584.14 → 9587.08] Even if it's Steam remote streaming to tablets?
[9587.22 → 9587.60] I don't know.
[9587.66 → 9588.74] Maybe a contest.
[9589.40 → 9592.50] Um, and part of what makes.
[9595.08 → 9601.14] Part of what makes his housework so well is that it wasn't done on a budget.
[9601.14 → 9606.60] And I think if you were to do it on a budget, like you could, you could do it.
[9606.70 → 9609.32] But by the time you're spending that kind of money, you would have been better off doing
[9609.32 → 9609.96] it is a different way.
[9610.14 → 9614.52] Like if I was going to put tablets on a bunch of stations, like what, sorry, why?
[9614.90 → 9615.22] Right.
[9615.24 → 9617.70] Because I'm spending hundreds of dollars now for what?
[9617.76 → 9618.46] A tiny screen.
[9618.54 → 9621.26] Well, why don't I just get, well, I could get a raspberry pie, I guess.
[9621.28 → 9622.44] Then I could get a big screen.
[9622.64 → 9623.68] Also, where would you get it?
[9623.68 → 9629.50] But yeah, like realistically, if you have the budget to do like a, like a, you know,
[9630.24 → 9632.00] how many stations were in the basement?
[9632.00 → 9634.24] Was it, was it six and six or eight and eight?
[9634.32 → 9636.00] I can't, I can't remember.
[9636.26 → 9637.16] I think it was 12.
[9637.22 → 9639.10] I think it was 12 in the basement and the DDR things.
[9639.24 → 9643.06] Like if you have that kind of space, guys, let's be real.
[9643.20 → 9647.48] The money for like a computer and a monitor, you got it.
[9647.48 → 9647.96] Right.
[9648.22 → 9653.40] So, well, here, that's true.
[9653.76 → 9655.88] There are places where space is not that expensive.
[9656.22 → 9656.94] Like where?
[9658.36 → 9659.88] Like space that is a house?
[9660.26 → 9660.54] Yeah.
[9661.18 → 9664.06] With like, you know, presumably nicely run wiring.
[9664.32 → 9668.84] Like by the time you bring in a contractor to run a bunch of, like, I mean, sure, we could
[9668.84 → 9672.54] do like the dirt version of it where you just like put Ethernet cables everywhere.
[9672.54 → 9678.90] But I don't, I don't know if there's a ton of value in it because at the end of the day,
[9678.96 → 9679.66] you still need GPU.
[9679.66 → 9680.68] Yeah, a bunch of people are saying Texas.
[9680.84 → 9682.02] What I will say, no.
[9682.02 → 9683.62] You need GPU horsepower to run it.
[9684.16 → 9687.76] And GPUs are going to be the single most expensive component of the whole thing.
[9687.78 → 9688.58] Alabama, Georgia.
[9688.78 → 9692.62] There are a lot of places in the States where you can get a relatively large house for not
[9692.62 → 9693.06] that much money.
[9693.10 → 9693.32] Okay.
[9693.34 → 9693.74] That's fair.
[9694.06 → 9694.50] That's fair.
[9694.96 → 9699.16] There are also a lot of places outside of North America where it's possible.
[9700.32 → 9700.92] I mean.
[9701.12 → 9701.44] Japan.
[9701.44 → 9701.54] Japan.
[9702.30 → 9703.82] Oh, well.
[9705.10 → 9705.50] Technicalities.
[9705.94 → 9706.30] Yeah.
[9706.44 → 9708.90] If you want to go to rural Japan, sure.
[9709.08 → 9712.52] I mean, you can get pretty darn close to big cities.
[9712.90 → 9715.62] You can get closer to we are than to Vancouver.
[9715.80 → 9716.92] Assuming they want you there.
[9717.68 → 9719.98] That might, that might be a part of the hurdles.
[9723.48 → 9723.84] Yeah.
[9725.06 → 9726.86] That's why I did the technicality hands.
[9727.22 → 9727.94] I mean, you know what?
[9727.94 → 9731.08] It is kind of a cool idea to do like the Jacky version of it, but.
[9731.64 → 9732.26] There'd be sauce.
[9732.44 → 9734.30] Take a router to your hardwood.
[9734.82 → 9735.00] We've.
[9735.84 → 9736.20] Oof.
[9736.64 → 9736.96] All right.
[9737.08 → 9738.32] I think Dennis already did that.
[9739.32 → 9739.50] Oh.
[9743.50 → 9743.90] Luke.
[9744.44 → 9745.38] He caught him.
[9746.16 → 9746.92] What a dick.
[9747.04 → 9748.04] What a dick.
[9748.04 → 9748.54] Okay.
[9748.54 → 9755.72] I'm just going to let you two sit with that.
[9756.62 → 9756.94] No.
[9757.44 → 9758.02] I won't.
[9758.14 → 9764.18] I buy TVs with composites still for old consoles, but the resolution and technical issues make
[9764.18 → 9764.72] it is flaky.
[9764.72 → 9770.24] Any recommendation for upscaling early 2000s consoles, or should I just emulate it if I
[9770.24 → 9770.86] own games?
[9770.86 → 9771.14] All right.
[9771.18 → 9772.10] Well, there are two answers.
[9772.24 → 9777.70] Number one is absolutely there are recommendations for upscaling early 2000s consoles.
[9777.92 → 9781.56] What you want is one of these.
[9784.78 → 9786.76] Oh my God.
[9786.76 → 9792.20] The reason it's so expensive is that it uses an FPGA.
[9792.46 → 9799.14] So these are extremely expensive processors and also work costs money, but this is a great
[9799.14 → 9806.38] way to take retro consoles and with no perceptible latency, upscale them as beautifully as possible
[9806.38 → 9810.36] to a modern TV with an HDMI input.
[9810.36 → 9815.10] As for your other question, should you just emulate?
[9815.62 → 9816.30] That depends.
[9816.62 → 9820.74] If you are a purist, and you want it to look as close to the original experience as possible,
[9820.86 → 9822.40] then no, you shouldn't emulate.
[9823.36 → 9824.30] But I would emulate.
[9824.80 → 9830.64] There's also another very expensive option, which is analog.
[9831.60 → 9831.92] Oh yeah.
[9831.98 → 9837.20] You could just buy consoles that run those old cartridges, but have an HDMI output.
[9837.42 → 9837.62] Yeah.
[9837.66 → 9838.76] They have an N64 now.
[9838.76 → 9840.68] Is it out?
[9841.28 → 9841.68] No.
[9842.26 → 9846.42] It's out of stock, but it released its shipping in July.
[9847.24 → 9847.64] Okay.
[9847.68 → 9848.40] That's not out then.
[9848.48 → 9849.52] The sales went live though.
[9849.78 → 9850.26] Oh, they did?
[9850.30 → 9850.50] That's what I'm saying.
[9850.58 → 9850.74] Yeah.
[9852.08 → 9854.80] The greatest multiplayer system of all time.
[9856.14 → 9856.58] Interesting.
[9857.36 → 9859.34] I think there are arguments that could be made for that.
[9860.44 → 9860.84] Really?
[9861.08 → 9861.28] I think so.
[9861.28 → 9862.76] You would argue that over...
[9863.38 → 9865.12] It depends on how much you value...
[9865.12 → 9868.74] Twisted Metal, like Taken, like...
[9868.76 → 9869.68] I don't know, man.
[9869.74 → 9870.22] PlayStation?
[9872.00 → 9877.16] The greatest multiplayer system of all time.
[9877.26 → 9878.28] PlayStation probably wins.
[9878.72 → 9880.90] But yeah, 007, Mario Kart, Smash Bros.
[9881.00 → 9886.46] 007 is UNEF***ING playable if you've touched a modern control scheme, and you try to go back
[9886.46 → 9886.78] to it.
[9887.00 → 9887.42] I'm sorry.
[9887.42 → 9887.78] But we're talking...
[9887.78 → 9888.52] Come a long way.
[9888.64 → 9891.38] You have to look at it in the time that it was released.
[9891.38 → 9891.58] No.
[9891.66 → 9897.30] If you make a statement like greatest of all time, you can't be like, yeah...
[9897.30 → 9900.10] No, you definitely still have to look at it when it was released.
[9900.10 → 9900.12] Oh, yeah.
[9900.12 → 9900.64] You kind of can.
[9900.74 → 9900.92] I mean...
[9900.92 → 9902.02] You absolutely have to.
[9902.56 → 9902.94] Okay.
[9903.06 → 9905.24] Or else it would like always be the most modern thing.
[9905.34 → 9905.62] That's...
[9905.62 → 9905.76] Yeah.
[9905.80 → 9906.24] That's ridiculous.
[9906.36 → 9906.52] Dude.
[9906.62 → 9907.42] I don't know, man.
[9907.42 → 9908.42] Like...
[9908.42 → 9910.84] That's a bold claim.
[9910.94 → 9911.52] That's a bold claim.
[9911.86 → 9912.42] Mario Party.
[9912.66 → 9914.16] N64 Mario Party was insane.
[9914.74 → 9915.12] Sure.
[9915.60 → 9919.42] I can't even think of a modern Mario Party that released afterwards that I liked.
[9919.82 → 9920.60] And Mario Party 64 was amazing.
[9920.60 → 9921.56] They just make it worse.
[9921.84 → 9922.22] Yeah.
[9922.30 → 9923.30] They're all awful.
[9923.52 → 9923.78] I'm kidding.
[9924.16 → 9924.98] No rock bands.
[9925.40 → 9926.16] No guitar hero.
[9927.08 → 9927.20] Yeah.
[9927.32 → 9927.92] Like, I'm just...
[9927.92 → 9930.40] Greatest of all time.
[9931.44 → 9932.38] That's tough.
[9932.60 → 9933.96] You've named like three games.
[9933.98 → 9936.00] What was the first console to have four controller ports?
[9936.58 → 9938.50] I think the SNES supported multi-tap.
[9939.70 → 9940.52] But that's...
[9940.52 → 9941.58] There were like three games.
[9941.58 → 9944.28] That's with the crazy adapter and there was like no games.
[9944.40 → 9945.26] I don't think that counts.
[9945.26 → 9948.02] But PS1 had a multi-tap that like actually had games that supported it.
[9948.02 → 9949.06] Did people buy it?
[9949.22 → 9950.66] Did it really like to exist?
[9950.82 → 9951.52] I think so.
[9951.60 → 9951.74] Yeah.
[9951.80 → 9955.94] Because I think making it physically part of the console counts for more, in my opinion.
[9956.98 → 9957.76] NEW had an adapter.
[9957.88 → 9958.20] I'm not...
[9958.20 → 9959.30] Yeah, I don't mean the adapters though.
[9959.34 → 9960.72] I really don't think the adapters count.
[9961.40 → 9964.34] They're like really hard to find now because basically none of them existed.
[9964.52 → 9965.46] I don't know, man.
[9965.46 → 9968.56] And it apparently worked for...
[9968.56 → 9970.02] Oh, I don't know if it was a different version.
[9970.28 → 9971.48] This is just Wikipedia.
[9972.12 → 9976.22] A multi-tap is a peripheral for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 that can be used to plug in
[9976.22 → 9979.58] up to four controllers and memory cards at the same time in a single controller port.
[9979.80 → 9983.74] With a second multi-tap, up to eight controllers and memory cards could be plugged in at once.
[9983.74 → 9984.76] These are really rare though.
[9984.92 → 9985.66] I don't think it counts.
[9985.66 → 9985.68] I don't think it counts.
[9985.68 → 9986.38] I don't think they were rare.
[9986.44 → 9987.74] I think they were...
[9987.74 → 9988.78] I mean, my friend had one.
[9988.86 → 9989.44] Like, I don't know.
[9989.66 → 9990.02] Yeah.
[9990.02 → 9990.88] We played Poi.
[9992.66 → 9992.94] Nice.
[9993.02 → 9995.24] We could play Poi with up to...
[9995.24 → 9995.94] Here, check this out.
[9995.98 → 9997.74] This game's actually like legit.
[9998.88 → 10000.24] It's kind of like...
[10000.24 → 10000.80] Did you ever...
[10000.80 → 10001.28] Remember that...
[10001.28 → 10002.24] N64 was first out of the box.
[10002.46 → 10004.58] And someone in full paint shot said that.
[10004.66 → 10005.32] I think that is true.
[10005.36 → 10006.12] I'm not ever so certain.
[10006.12 → 10011.74] And I think that's why they're giving it this title is it's the first one with four out
[10011.74 → 10012.22] of the box.
[10012.46 → 10013.20] I guess.
[10013.32 → 10014.10] And I think that's a pretty big deal.
[10014.22 → 10015.78] But like PS1 supported eight.
[10016.02 → 10016.92] So I guess...
[10016.92 → 10019.04] Yeah, but people didn't have the multi-tap thing.
[10019.04 → 10019.52] Check this out.
[10019.66 → 10023.00] Remember that game Bomb Squad that we played on Android at my place?
[10023.00 → 10029.98] This is like Bomb Squad, but like where every item is like six polygons.
[10030.58 → 10032.88] So yeah, you could pick each other up and throw each other.
[10033.06 → 10034.22] There are bombs.
[10034.22 → 10035.42] There's...
[10035.42 → 10037.90] You could like to pick up logs and Huck them at each other.
[10039.36 → 10040.70] It's pretty fun, actually.
[10041.98 → 10043.66] Looks more entertaining than most phone games.
[10044.22 → 10044.54] Yep.
[10044.76 → 10045.20] Got them.
[10045.78 → 10046.82] Poi, let's go.
[10047.84 → 10048.60] Ten seconds.
[10048.72 → 10050.72] I found one on shopgoodwill.com for a multi-tap.
[10050.92 → 10051.98] People are really...
[10051.98 → 10056.10] Maybe I'm just doing a terrible job of explaining my stances today, but people really don't get
[10056.10 → 10056.20] it.
[10056.34 → 10057.54] I'm not talking about now.
[10057.72 → 10058.56] How does it feel to be me?
[10058.58 → 10059.66] It's like deeply not the point.
[10059.80 → 10060.86] Like at all.
[10060.86 → 10065.34] What I'm talking about is he had a friend that had it when he was growing up.
[10065.60 → 10066.86] I had zero...
[10066.86 → 10068.88] No one that I knew that had a PlayStation had one.
[10068.88 → 10072.66] I bet you most people that owned PlayStation's back then didn't even know they existed.
[10072.86 → 10073.96] That's my point.
[10075.32 → 10076.56] Anyway, it's fine.
[10076.64 → 10077.64] I didn't say I don't know.
[10078.42 → 10078.92] I didn't say that.
[10079.42 → 10079.48] I know.
[10079.48 → 10080.60] I'm doing it for you.
[10080.60 → 10086.92] I'm feeding on his salt today.
[10087.14 → 10090.14] Somebody thought a techie in float plane chat said I didn't know they existed.
[10090.44 → 10091.12] Like, come on.
[10091.72 → 10092.50] Come on!
[10093.62 → 10094.28] All right.
[10094.82 → 10095.30] Hit us, Dan.
[10095.50 → 10097.20] Hello, Linus Laid Development.
[10097.48 → 10100.92] Moving to a new place, and I'm treating myself to this MCM bundle.
[10101.02 → 10101.20] Nice.
[10101.20 → 10105.82] Which you can get for half off on lttstore.com and save the shipping if you buy over $150.
[10106.20 → 10106.72] Let's go!
[10106.72 → 10108.04] Question for Luke.
[10108.20 → 10110.80] I tend to have my hobbies tied around my line of work.
[10110.98 → 10112.32] CS plus AI.
[10112.82 → 10114.10] Do you face this issue?
[10114.30 → 10114.52] Yes.
[10114.94 → 10115.22] Yeah.
[10116.92 → 10118.08] I don't mind it that much.
[10118.36 → 10125.54] I was told my whole life growing up that don't do what you love because you're blah, blah, blah.
[10125.58 → 10126.62] You won't be able to enjoy it anymore.
[10126.82 → 10128.58] And no.
[10129.78 → 10133.98] I mean, I think you did find that to a degree with game streaming.
[10134.54 → 10134.92] Yeah.
[10136.72 → 10139.60] You got pretty demotivated about game streaming after a while.
[10140.14 → 10141.78] It didn't make you not enjoy gaming, though.
[10142.12 → 10143.00] It didn't at all.
[10143.32 → 10147.18] And I mostly got demotivated because the environment that I was in was not conducive to it, so I
[10147.18 → 10148.24] was weighing on other people.
[10148.28 → 10148.52] Got it.
[10148.54 → 10151.48] Like, if I game stream right now, I am annoying someone.
[10151.48 → 10154.96] You'll be annoying me because you're supposed to be working on WAN Show.
[10155.66 → 10156.26] Oh, man.
[10156.26 → 10156.74] No.
[10158.48 → 10158.80] No.
[10158.94 → 10160.54] I'm going to open up a browser game.
[10160.84 → 10160.96] No.
[10162.14 → 10162.46] RuneScape.
[10164.66 → 10164.98] Yeah.
[10165.10 → 10170.58] So it's like, there have been many times when I would like to stream what I'm playing right
[10170.58 → 10170.82] now.
[10171.06 → 10172.34] And it's just like, ugh.
[10172.34 → 10172.56] Yeah.
[10172.94 → 10174.08] It's just going to annoy someone.
[10174.28 → 10175.00] I don't want to bother.
[10175.00 → 10177.12] But I do want to return to it eventually.
[10177.32 → 10179.12] It probably won't be anytime soon, so don't get excited.
[10179.32 → 10182.58] Maybe I should just get set up so that I could stream in the basement because I almost never
[10182.58 → 10183.52] game upstairs anymore.
[10184.48 → 10187.00] Because, like, my kids are usually down in the basement and stuff.
[10187.16 → 10187.94] Just get a webcam.
[10188.40 → 10188.50] Yeah.
[10188.50 → 10191.46] Because, like, I have my nice streaming setup, and it's, like, great for calls.
[10191.46 → 10193.92] And, like, I have that road mic that's, like, this long.
[10194.02 → 10194.66] You've seen my desk.
[10195.66 → 10199.20] But, honestly, it's not the most comfortable for gaming.
[10200.04 → 10203.24] And if I have anyone in person with me, it's not that great.
[10203.54 → 10206.78] You know what I really need to do is I need to set it up so that I can, like, multiplayer
[10206.78 → 10207.66] game in my theatre.
[10208.20 → 10209.64] There's no reason not to.
[10209.90 → 10210.34] Can't you?
[10210.62 → 10211.16] Well, yeah.
[10211.26 → 10211.86] No, I totally can't.
[10211.86 → 10212.98] Well, I don't have a headset in there.
[10213.06 → 10214.18] Like, I don't.
[10214.18 → 10214.70] Like, it's not.
[10214.80 → 10216.22] I don't have a computer in there right now.
[10216.22 → 10216.28] Oh, I see what you mean.
[10216.44 → 10217.86] Dude, playing Anna on the.
[10218.10 → 10219.04] Didn't we talk about it?
[10219.04 → 10220.08] I think we've talked about this before.
[10220.08 → 10221.48] I have never played Anna on it.
[10221.54 → 10223.34] Playing Anna on there would be so sick.
[10223.58 → 10224.20] I haven't.
[10224.20 → 10225.46] I actually would be so sick.
[10225.48 → 10228.52] Like, when we're doing our tape-to-tape runs, why am I sitting at my desk?
[10228.62 → 10229.38] Honestly, yeah, I don't know.
[10229.44 → 10230.14] That's crazy.
[10230.30 → 10230.88] Yeah, kind of.
[10231.00 → 10231.96] Like, what am I doing?
[10232.22 → 10232.42] Yeah.
[10232.72 → 10233.44] So, um.
[10233.50 → 10236.44] See, I would prefer that he solves that before he tries to, like.
[10236.68 → 10238.34] I think Linus's land house is fine.
[10238.54 → 10240.16] The fact that someone else has a cooler one.
[10240.44 → 10240.86] Oh, yeah.
[10241.06 → 10241.60] No, I wasn't.
[10241.86 → 10242.38] Is whatever.
[10242.52 → 10243.58] I wasn't upset in any way.
[10243.70 → 10244.44] I don't.
[10244.44 → 10247.78] If I want to do, like, a 20-plus person land, we'll do it at Smash Jams.
[10247.94 → 10248.12] Yeah.
[10248.12 → 10249.30] Like, I got a plan for that.
[10249.30 → 10249.96] We have options.
[10250.44 → 10252.70] But those types of things, I think, would be cool to solve.
[10252.70 → 10255.70] Making streaming less of a chore is a cool idea.
[10256.18 → 10256.68] And then, yeah.
[10256.94 → 10259.34] Being able to play tape-to-tape or Anna or whatever from the theatre room.
[10259.38 → 10261.04] I finally have a computer in there.
[10261.30 → 10261.58] I just.
[10262.30 → 10262.62] Okay.
[10262.72 → 10266.98] What I wanted to do was I wanted to do something that was, like, almost entirely passive.
[10267.36 → 10269.50] Because I have that perforated drawer thing.
[10269.50 → 10269.68] Yeah.
[10269.68 → 10270.72] And then I have fans at the top.
[10270.78 → 10271.22] And I wanted to.
[10271.32 → 10274.08] I wanted to do, like, a whole thing where it was, like, convection cooled or something.
[10274.12 → 10274.46] And I just.
[10275.52 → 10277.50] It hasn't been a priority on the video side.
[10277.50 → 10278.92] And I haven't gotten around to it personally.
[10279.08 → 10281.24] So, I just haven't had a computer in there the whole time.
[10281.24 → 10283.70] And the idea was that I would share my computer across it.
[10283.78 → 10286.26] But then, with the multiple monitors plugged in.
[10286.68 → 10289.52] And which one is your primary monitor and your secondary and your tertiary.
[10289.70 → 10290.48] And not on Windows.
[10290.58 → 10292.40] Not being able to change those assignments.
[10292.60 → 10293.32] And, like, the whole thing.
[10293.38 → 10295.18] It's been kind of a pain in the butt.
[10295.28 → 10297.96] And Wendell's KVM was theoretically a perfect solution for it.
[10297.98 → 10300.28] But then, I was having trouble with the USB extensions.
[10300.48 → 10301.96] And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[10302.04 → 10304.66] The long story short is I just need to put a stupid computer in there.
[10305.10 → 10308.40] And Falcon Northwest, we have a review coming of their Tiki.
[10308.40 → 10309.22] Oh, you're putting that in there.
[10309.70 → 10309.96] No.
[10310.20 → 10310.40] Oh.
[10310.72 → 10311.74] They sent over their Tiki.
[10312.14 → 10314.86] And what they wanted to send us was not actually the Tiki.
[10315.02 → 10318.36] But I said, I want the Tiki because I think it's a perfect match for the 5090.
[10318.36 → 10319.72] Which is what they have in it.
[10319.76 → 10321.46] Because it actually blows right through.
[10321.68 → 10322.10] Oh, it's sick.
[10322.10 → 10322.76] Which is pretty cool.
[10322.84 → 10322.96] Yeah.
[10322.96 → 10325.42] Because it doesn't share any of that heat with the other components.
[10325.42 → 10327.84] Like we observed in our review of the RTX 5090.
[10328.04 → 10330.70] Where it heats up your CPU and RAM and stuff.
[10332.04 → 10333.16] But they were like, okay.
[10334.56 → 10336.82] We'll send you the Tiki because that's what you guys want.
[10336.90 → 10341.26] And realistically, if we can be the first system review on LTT in two years.
[10341.26 → 10341.74] Then I guess.
[10342.00 → 10343.14] Because it's a super cool system.
[10343.64 → 10344.02] It is.
[10344.10 → 10345.50] So Jake's working on the review of that.
[10345.86 → 10347.88] But what we really wanted to send was the flag box.
[10348.38 → 10349.36] So we'll send you one.
[10349.48 → 10350.82] But can you just try it?
[10350.84 → 10351.46] And I was like, okay.
[10352.12 → 10352.76] So I don't know.
[10352.76 → 10354.40] I don't know when they need it back or whatever.
[10354.40 → 10355.52] But for now, it's in my house.
[10356.42 → 10358.06] And speaking of stealing things from work.
[10358.22 → 10358.96] I had an idea.
[10359.30 → 10360.54] And I put it in the theatre room.
[10362.44 → 10364.34] And our next tape to tape run.
[10364.50 → 10365.14] I'm going to be.
[10365.42 → 10366.32] You can come over.
[10366.44 → 10367.60] You can sit in the theatre room with me.
[10367.66 → 10368.86] But I'm going to be in the theatre room.
[10368.96 → 10369.18] Sweet.
[10369.64 → 10369.82] Sweet.
[10369.90 → 10371.16] There's no way around it.
[10371.62 → 10372.10] I had an idea.
[10372.22 → 10372.90] You might like it.
[10373.30 → 10374.82] It's very Linus beneficial.
[10375.32 → 10377.14] It doesn't do literally anything for me.
[10377.48 → 10378.32] But I think you'll like it.
[10378.34 → 10379.26] I think it's a decent idea.
[10379.46 → 10379.66] Yes.
[10379.66 → 10380.80] You know that.
[10380.92 → 10381.92] I'm going to be kind of vague.
[10381.98 → 10382.64] But I think you'll get it.
[10382.70 → 10384.36] You know that thing that we're specking?
[10386.86 → 10388.02] You called me about it.
[10388.88 → 10390.56] You're like, I don't know about these specks.
[10391.60 → 10392.54] They're a little much.
[10394.86 → 10396.18] When's the last time you called me?
[10396.64 → 10397.88] Is it like a gaming plane?
[10398.14 → 10398.44] No.
[10399.28 → 10400.14] That's funny though.
[10400.70 → 10402.22] We talked about it in text.
[10402.88 → 10404.56] No, I'm trying to pick up the phone call.
[10406.78 → 10407.64] I'm trying to be vague.
[10407.84 → 10408.76] In the other building.
[10408.76 → 10409.46] Gaming jet.
[10409.66 → 10410.06] No.
[10412.94 → 10414.34] Again, we talked about that in text.
[10415.00 → 10415.24] Okay.
[10416.88 → 10418.20] You called me about it this week.
[10418.72 → 10419.08] Okay.
[10419.72 → 10420.64] A jet for gaming.
[10423.22 → 10424.52] I mean, I can just say it.
[10424.68 → 10425.78] I don't know if I need to.
[10426.20 → 10426.66] I don't know.
[10426.74 → 10428.02] I have no idea what you're talking about.
[10428.26 → 10430.22] We're thinking about making a home theatre set.
[10430.24 → 10431.30] Oh God, don't talk about that.
[10431.46 → 10431.98] I'm kidding.
[10431.98 → 10437.38] Yes, we are working on one of the original lab things that we were supposed to have, which
[10437.38 → 10442.80] is a light-controlled environment that we could also use for not only just testing displays
[10442.80 → 10450.70] like in general because it's light controlled, but also we could use for like setting up big TVs and projectors so that we're not always using my theatre room at home for testing stuff.
[10451.10 → 10453.60] This has noticeable negatives.
[10453.60 → 10454.62] I just want to be very clear.
[10454.62 → 10457.52] But there is one really major positive.
[10457.52 → 10459.36] So I'm throwing it out there.
[10459.44 → 10459.74] All right.
[10460.08 → 10469.52] What if we just recreated your home theatre room so that anything that you liked in there, you would know exactly what it was like.
[10469.62 → 10470.70] We could have that cubby.
[10470.80 → 10473.52] If something fit in there, and you liked it, you could just take it home.
[10473.74 → 10475.00] No, that's a terrible idea.
[10475.00 → 10475.56] Perfectly.
[10475.82 → 10476.96] Everything would be exact.
[10477.30 → 10479.08] You could cheat in certain ways.
[10479.36 → 10488.08] Like I think this was James Strive's idea, but you could make the wall behind the TV a fake wall and just have a mount there so we could have more space back there and stuff.
[10488.30 → 10490.68] But other than that, things would sound mostly correct.
[10490.68 → 10491.34] That's hilarious.
[10491.52 → 10492.72] Things would look mostly correct.
[10492.80 → 10493.92] Things would fit mostly correct.
[10493.92 → 10494.88] Chad likes this.
[10494.98 → 10496.10] Oh, come on, you guys.
[10496.58 → 10501.14] Alfred's going to kill me because they don't have as much filming areas on the size which they wanted.
[10502.76 → 10503.24] Sorry.
[10503.80 → 10504.84] I'll think about it.
[10504.84 → 10505.42] I'll think about it.
[10505.42 → 10506.82] Maybe you could just make it similar.
[10507.38 → 10509.32] It would be better if it was bigger, honestly.
[10509.50 → 10514.58] I wanted to make my theatre room bigger because the seating is a little bit cramped.
[10515.36 → 10522.32] Like when we really like to have it packed with people, it's, I wish it was probably about one seat wider.
[10522.32 → 10527.36] Like I'm not saying, oh, you know, oh, yes, my, my personal theatre room is not big enough.
[10527.54 → 10529.40] Like I'm not, I'm not, but I would have preferred.
[10529.64 → 10534.82] There is a there is a mild amount of lack of prime seats.
[10534.82 → 10535.36] Yes.
[10535.36 → 10535.48] Yes.
[10535.74 → 10535.96] Yeah.
[10535.96 → 10540.88] And, and, and so if you're all like huddled around like playing an eight player game together, it's, it's, it's not.
[10540.88 → 10542.52] There are a few people that don't have great seats.
[10542.52 → 10542.68] Yeah.
[10542.68 → 10552.14] And, and I, what I, what I would have wanted is to have a larger screen and like a 21 by nine modular display in the long term.
[10552.14 → 10555.68] I would have loved to use like modular panels to have a 21 by nine display.
[10555.76 → 10556.64] That would have been my ideal.
[10556.64 → 10558.64] I want to temper people's expectations.
[10558.82 → 10560.28] Mawson said, nope, do it right.
[10560.80 → 10563.32] Uh, we're not going to do it like right, right.
[10563.68 → 10567.40] It'll be like, right, right is actually kind of crazy.
[10567.56 → 10567.74] Yeah.
[10567.74 → 10572.02] It involves like, like a room within a room and like suspended floor.
[10572.02 → 10575.16] And I like, you're spending incredible amounts of money.
[10575.24 → 10578.42] I don't know how forever our current facilities are.
[10578.72 → 10580.24] Um, they're really not ideal.
[10580.24 → 10585.10] The team doesn't love being separated between the two buildings down the street and stuff like that.
[10585.68 → 10586.28] Yeah.
[10586.56 → 10591.38] Um, we haven't found an alternative.
[10591.38 → 10600.72] Like we kind of for, we found a really nice building a while back, but when we surveyed the team, the attrition was unacceptable.
[10600.72 → 10610.12] We would have lost, um, not only a huge portion of our team, but we would have lost key members that I think you guys would have been very disappointed in us.
[10610.24 → 10612.88] For not doing everything we could to retain.
[10613.22 → 10621.78] And so asking for all these stars to align something that is large enough to accommodate us affordable enough that we can trade our current holdings for it.
[10621.78 → 10625.68] Because I don't realistically want to put a ton more money into lower mainland real estate.
[10625.68 → 10629.90] Um, and also is in approximately the same location.
[10629.90 → 10637.90] So we aren't f***ING over people who literally picked up their lives and moved them and put down roots to be near Linus Media Group and affiliated companies.
[10637.90 → 10640.54] Like it just hasn't happened.
[10640.74 → 10642.96] And it's going to be tough to happen, but.
[10643.10 → 10644.74] But if something were to come up.
[10644.80 → 10645.68] We would like to take that up.
[10645.68 → 10653.70] I don't want to spend a quarter million dollars on this room that we are literally going to bulldoze because looking at the way it has to be constructed, it's not modular.
[10653.88 → 10655.52] It can't be like taken apart and reused.
[10655.52 → 10659.00] I want to be in a position where it's like, okay, everyone grab your go bag.
[10659.08 → 10659.46] Let's go.
[10659.96 → 10662.18] Um, which obviously wouldn't be quite like, but.
[10662.42 → 10662.54] No.
[10662.76 → 10663.38] Yeah, I don't know.
[10664.76 → 10665.64] I don't know.
[10667.50 → 10668.78] Oh, uh, oh yeah.
[10668.86 → 10669.28] Dan's there.
[10669.84 → 10671.88] Doesn't know, knows a guy and narcissist.
[10672.22 → 10675.60] I've noticed that the MCM goes on promo a lot.
[10675.82 → 10678.70] Does that mean it's not moving as fast as you'd hoped?
[10679.18 → 10681.82] I would hate to see it discontinued if it's a slow mover.
[10682.04 → 10682.80] Oh, MCM is great.
[10683.06 → 10685.08] It's just something that people love.
[10685.22 → 10688.28] And, uh, we do promos sometimes on things that people love.
[10688.30 → 10689.44] And we promo the screwdriver.
[10689.58 → 10692.60] We sell anywhere from like 50 to 150 screwdrivers a day.
[10693.38 → 10696.02] Um, it's a it's a great business for us.
[10696.04 → 10697.88] And MCM is also a great business for us.
[10697.92 → 10698.84] We have new products coming.
[10699.12 → 10701.16] It's also, it's a line of products, right?
[10701.16 → 10708.18] So if you, if you buy in, and you make your desk super nice, you might be inspired in the future to make your home theatre room super nice.
[10708.18 → 10711.70] And like, you know, inside baseball talk, you're going to buy this.
[10711.78 → 10713.18] You could get a good deal on this.
[10713.28 → 10714.54] Now you're in the ecosystem, right?
[10714.58 → 10724.36] So if you want one more, you know, power brick adapter, you want a couple more of the, uh, the, the little keyhole adapters for power strips and stuff like that.
[10724.42 → 10730.24] Well, you're going to come back and pay full pop for them unless you can be super patient and, and, uh, you know, wait for a promo again.
[10730.24 → 10734.14] So one of those things where we got to, you got to get people to actually like to try it.
[10734.26 → 10734.42] Yeah.
[10734.66 → 10735.50] We want you to try it.
[10735.50 → 10737.00] Cause when you try it, you're going to love it.
[10737.06 → 10737.26] Yeah.
[10737.26 → 10738.22] And then we got you.
[10738.48 → 10738.70] Yeah.
[10738.90 → 10740.10] Because it's a really great product.
[10740.10 → 10748.48] And the only way for someone to try to undercut it would be to just make no margin on it because what makes it good is the cost of the materials.
[10748.58 → 10755.06] So you can't make a knock off one, uh, without keeping out on the magnets and then your product will suck.
[10755.36 → 10767.24] So we have a pretty good, um, functionality moat around it where there's just really not much point in someone competing with it because they're either going to have to spend a bunch of money.
[10767.24 → 10770.16] On neodymium in order to match the functionality of it.
[10770.16 → 10781.04] Or if they don't care about that, then they're going to be, or if they want like a crappier one, then they're going to be up against people just 3d printing their own and like hot gluing magnets into them, which is basically zero cost.
[10781.04 → 10798.00] So there's not really room to, well, I shouldn't say that because I'm sure someone's going to be like, and I took that personally and like try and compete with it or whatever, but it's very difficult to create a new value proposition for a product that is, uh, like this, but I don't know.
[10798.06 → 10798.60] Like this.
[10798.60 → 10802.42] Last one I've got for you today.
[10802.78 → 10805.10] What's the best way to clean my old desk pad?
[10805.60 → 10807.76] Postscriptum, I already got a new one.
[10808.26 → 10813.60] Um, I always put mine in the washing machine cold.
[10813.76 → 10815.08] Even though you're not supposed to.
[10815.20 → 10816.38] But you're not supposed to.
[10817.08 → 10820.12] But I've always had good luck with it.
[10820.84 → 10825.56] Um, but what I think you're supposed to do is just use like a wetted cloth and wipe it or something like that.
[10825.66 → 10828.56] I've, I've, that is, that is, I believe that is what you're supposed to do.
[10828.64 → 10831.10] I've done that, and it doesn't work as well.
[10831.72 → 10833.50] So make of that what you will.
[10833.70 → 10835.56] And it's, it's getting to be a thing for me.
[10835.56 → 10837.58] Because I got a, I got a walking pad.
[10837.74 → 10838.10] Yeah.
[10838.10 → 10842.72] I've been doing that, that walking at home, and I am already a sweaty boy.
[10842.80 → 10847.34] And then I walk on the walking pad at like three and a half miles an hour for like a couple of hours.
[10847.34 → 10852.30] And then, uh, I need to wash my desk pad.
[10852.98 → 10853.34] Nice.
[10853.64 → 10856.92] And when I do that, I put it in the washing machine.
[10857.02 → 10858.04] So it is what it is.
[10858.10 → 10859.30] We should do a walking land show.
[10859.40 → 10860.16] See if I can keep up.
[10860.72 → 10861.58] I'm sure you could.
[10863.98 → 10865.08] I'm doing it right now.
[10867.04 → 10868.34] Prove I'm not walking under here.
[10868.90 → 10869.74] I can't, I can't.
[10869.80 → 10870.52] It's impossible.
[10871.06 → 10872.28] What walking pad do you have?
[10872.34 → 10873.26] I don't remember.
[10873.74 → 10874.10] Cool.
[10874.24 → 10875.16] I did a bunch of research.
[10875.26 → 10875.72] I bought it.
[10875.72 → 10881.72] It's not actually something I like care about or am interested in, but I made sure that I got one that seemed good, and it seems good.
[10881.84 → 10885.36] My only problem is I'm a big boy, and it's kind of narrow.
[10885.66 → 10889.96] So I end up doing a bit of like a almost like a catwalk.
[10890.92 → 10891.62] Oh, I see.
[10891.66 → 10893.42] I have to like to cross my feet in a little bit.
[10893.82 → 10894.60] Get that hip sway.
[10894.80 → 10895.04] Yeah.
[10895.04 → 10896.42] Which is not awesome.
[10896.42 → 10901.56] But I don't think there's much wider ones that don't end up getting like really bulky.
[10901.74 → 10906.72] And one of the nice things about the one that I have is when I fold it up because it folds, which is nice.
[10906.86 → 10908.02] And I roll it away.
[10908.12 → 10911.56] It can fit under a chair that is in our little area.
[10911.56 → 10914.70] So it gets to like kind of get put away, which is nice.
[10914.96 → 10917.84] I just like this one because they referred to you as Big L.
[10919.62 → 10921.80] Like the Big L you took before the show.
[10922.90 → 10924.36] You should have lost as well.
[10924.56 → 10924.84] We should have.
[10925.00 → 10927.08] Us both losing would have been completely fine.
[10927.40 → 10927.96] You winning makes no sense.
[10927.96 → 10936.44] I think you both should have lost because you delayed title thumbnail even more to have your petty squabble outside about Luke's car parked illegally.
[10936.44 → 10941.72] And offensive to, uh, yeah.
[10941.72 → 10942.66] I didn't even realize it.
[10942.66 → 10943.14] Go ahead, Dan.
[10943.50 → 10943.96] Sure.
[10944.10 → 10944.50] My bad.
[10944.74 → 10946.00] Second last one I've got.
[10947.00 → 10951.72] Dear Big L, Big D, and Little L, listening from Osaka, Japan.
[10952.04 → 10957.64] As a wannabe business owner, what point did you realize your business was going to be viable long term?
[10958.04 → 10960.44] Gaming dirigible hot air balloon win.
[10960.54 → 10960.78] Okay.
[10960.88 → 10962.06] Never for that second thing.
[10962.06 → 10967.64] And as for realizing the business was going to be viable long term, I mean, it depends on what you mean by long term.
[10967.92 → 10969.90] Like so few companies last 100 years.
[10970.68 → 10974.16] Um, as for like, oh man, when did we think.
[10974.16 → 10978.22] We were pretty confident we were going to make it from the start because we were, you, you bought the channel.
[10978.36 → 10980.86] You bought the channel for a dollar after that.
[10981.24 → 10982.64] Oh, no, I wasn't at all.
[10982.70 → 10985.40] I, I, no, I talked a good game, but I was not sure.
[10985.66 → 10986.68] I, I mean, I was in.
[10986.72 → 10987.46] That's pretty confident anyway.
[10987.50 → 10989.54] I was in desperation survival mode.
[10989.54 → 10992.12] I knew more numbers than I was supposed to, and I was pretty confident.
[10993.00 → 10996.56] Probably until we paid off this building.
[10997.62 → 11000.44] I was probably in like frantic survival mode.
[11000.50 → 11001.42] Yeah, but I like that.
[11002.10 → 11006.50] Okay, but that's not, that's not viable long term.
[11006.76 → 11007.50] For me, it is.
[11007.60 → 11008.30] Oh, shoot.
[11009.74 → 11011.62] Luke and I have the same stress disorder.
[11011.62 → 11014.60] Oh my God, is everything going to implode?
[11015.10 → 11017.14] Now I'm finally comfortable.
[11017.36 → 11020.88] I start to shut down and like things suck, and I get depressed.
[11022.92 → 11025.96] I don't like hearing words back at me.
[11027.00 → 11027.44] Okay.
[11027.62 → 11028.46] Well, anyway.
[11029.08 → 11030.22] We need therapy.
[11030.68 → 11030.90] Yeah.
[11031.32 → 11032.04] I'm good.
[11032.26 → 11032.80] Yeah, me too.
[11032.80 → 11033.36] Yeah.
[11034.78 → 11035.12] Yeah.
[11035.14 → 11041.00] I think when we, I think when we paid off this building, I felt like it was going to be viable
[11041.00 → 11041.36] long term.
[11041.44 → 11044.44] Even then we were still like so much at the mercy of YouTube back then.
[11044.66 → 11044.92] Yeah.
[11044.98 → 11051.68] And when I felt properly diversified enough that we could lose any individual business unit,
[11051.68 → 11060.22] like not just lose any one sponsor, but like lose any business unit and still limp along was probably when we launched Backpack and Screwdriver.
[11061.12 → 11074.28] Because all of a sudden the merch business could sustain the YouTube business, even if like sponsorships dried up or if AdSense went away or if affiliate revenue went away.
[11074.28 → 11083.06] And in the same way, the YouTube business could continue to support the merch business if, you know, they had a couple of flops, or they had a bad year or whatever else.
[11083.16 → 11101.08] Like it felt with the left hand and the right hand helping each other balance out, I think was when I like really felt like, okay, yeah, like LMG float plane, creator warehouse, smash chance, you know, BC, LTD, whatever the hold co umbrella corporation is like.
[11101.08 → 11105.58] Like that's when I really felt like, okay, no, this is like a real org.
[11108.90 → 11112.80] Just like I felt like this is a real end of the WAN show.
[11115.12 → 11116.62] Wait, I was wrong though.
[11117.78 → 11122.42] Because I haven't told the people about the incredible ship storm promo running on LTT store.com.

[11167.20 → 11168.26] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[11169.58 → 11169.94] Bye.
[11170.20 → 11171.74] And I'm completely sure of that.
[11172.56 → 11173.00] Are you?
[11173.20 → 11173.50] Yeah.
[11173.74 → 11173.96] What?
[11174.78 → 11175.46] Are you guys meeting?
[11175.88 → 11175.98] Oh.
[11175.98 → 11181.18] It works right now.
[11182.38 → 11184.70] Yeah, they're total overlays.
[11185.96 → 11186.52] Nice.
[11188.42 → 11189.84] Wow, there's so many.
[11191.74 → 11193.62] Apparently it has a warning.
[11194.48 → 11194.66] Yeah.
[11194.88 → 11195.38] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11198.46 → 11200.10] How long are these going to go for?
[11200.26 → 11201.68] About two minutes.
[11202.06 → 11202.88] Two more minutes?
[11203.50 → 11204.42] Two minutes.
[11204.42 → 11205.20] Good Lord.
[11205.20 → 11205.90] All right.
[11205.96 → 11206.92] Well, what are your plans this weekend?
[11209.90 → 11211.94] I'm going to see the thing.
[11211.94 → 11213.00] Oh, you're going to see the thing.
[11213.12 → 11213.34] Yeah.
[11213.68 → 11214.18] Okay, cool.
[11214.36 → 11215.68] No, probably not the one that you think.
[11216.08 → 11216.58] Oh, I'm going to see.
[11218.28 → 11222.42] I mean, the practical thing.
[11223.06 → 11224.08] No, no, no, no, no.
[11224.26 → 11224.70] Oh, the cool thing.
[11224.72 → 11225.98] Completely unrelated to all that.
[11230.98 → 11231.58] The jack?
[11231.58 → 11231.64] The jack?
[11231.64 → 11231.68] The jack?
[11231.68 → 11232.64] The jack?
[11232.64 → 11233.64] The jack?
[11233.64 → 11234.58] The jack?
[11235.20 → 11236.04] The jack?
[11236.46 → 11236.92] The jack?
[11236.92 → 11237.20] The jack?
[11237.46 → 11237.52] The jack?
[11237.52 → 11237.74] The jack?
[11237.74 → 11238.14] Which one?
[11238.32 → 11238.64] Minecraft?
[11238.64 → 11239.48] I would go.
[11239.72 → 11240.20] I would go.
[11240.32 → 11240.92] Chat's guessing.
[11241.02 → 11241.30] Minecraft.
[11241.54 → 11242.38] I would go see the jack?
[11243.08 → 11244.12] Oh, no.
[11244.58 → 11245.46] Have you figured it out yet?
[11245.46 → 11246.46] A relative.
[11246.46 → 11249.18] Uh, a relative.
[11250.86 → 11251.24] Yeah.
[11251.52 → 11251.80] Okay.
[11252.06 → 11252.30] Good.
[11253.00 → 11253.42] I'll be fine.
[11253.68 → 11254.04] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11254.20 → 11254.44] Yeah.
[11254.58 → 11255.18] There you might have.
[11255.98 → 11256.40] There you are.
[11256.84 → 11256.98] No.
[11260.98 → 11261.74] Oh, my God.
[11262.54 → 11265.84] Might also go see the original thing that you mentioned.
[11265.90 → 11267.04] Yeah, you should go see that thing.
[11267.14 → 11269.38] We're trying to figure out, like, I'm in the community.
[11269.84 → 11270.62] Mm-hmm.
[11270.62 → 11273.30] I don't think I've ever seen anything that's efficient before.
[11273.74 → 11274.72] Yeah, that makes sense.
[11275.44 → 11276.36] Maybe not forever.
[11276.44 → 11277.30] Probably not for long.
[11277.64 → 11278.06] Let's go.
[11279.06 → 11279.66] Let's go.
[11281.28 → 11282.40] Good gravy.
[11282.72 → 11284.20] We're very, very close to it.
[11284.56 → 11285.30] Like, genuinely.
[11285.80 → 11290.24] It's pretty sad that this might be, like, the last time this year that we make money on
[11290.24 → 11292.38] the store selling to certain countries.
[11292.54 → 11293.72] It was nice working for you.
[11293.72 → 11323.70] Thank you.
