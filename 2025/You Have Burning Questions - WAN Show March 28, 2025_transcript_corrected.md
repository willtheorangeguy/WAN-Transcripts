[0.94 → 8.14] What's up everyone and welcome to the WAN show! We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[8.32 → 15.14] We're going to be talking about your burning questions. That's right, you have burning questions and I want to answer them.
[15.46 → 22.60] We uploaded our How Does LTT Make Money video earlier this week, and you might have noticed the thumbnail is a little mangled.
[22.84 → 28.28] That's because there's also been some new information surfacing around the whole honey thing.
[28.28 → 32.96] Oh. It's all about the money. It's all about the honey money honey.
[33.60 → 37.32] We've got a lot of great topics for you guys so we'll be answering some of your questions.
[37.54 → 44.80] We're also going to be talking about, oh, 23andMe filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
[45.16 → 51.94] Who could have seen this coming? Who indeed? Perhaps an officer of vision somewhere.
[52.64 → 56.06] A chief of some sort. Now what else we got this week?
[56.06 → 58.06] You stole one of mine, but I figured it out.
[58.72 → 64.88] The AMD says RX 9070 XT sold 10 times more than predecessor in first week.
[65.86 → 70.40] Wow. I don't know what's more impressive, how many they sold of the 9000 series?
[70.40 → 70.98] Or how few?
[73.06 → 74.04] Let's go on.
[74.24 → 77.96] Rough. Also, the Have I Been Pwned guy got pwned.
[78.06 → 81.22] Oh, Troy Hunt. The hunter has become the hunted.
[81.46 → 84.26] This is honestly probably good for everyone. We'll discuss later.
[86.06 → 88.30] I'll just leave it there. I'll explain later.
[88.30 → 88.54] Okay.
[88.54 → 112.56] The show is brought to you today by AMD, along with Delete Me and XSplit.
[112.56 → 119.70] To go with our usual wrap partner, Brand, laptop partner, Adele, and of course, chair partner.
[120.46 → 121.00] That way.
[121.54 → 122.18] Secret lab.
[122.42 → 123.36] I really didn't get out of the way.
[123.36 → 123.92] There we go.
[124.46 → 127.24] Man, it's a good thing we didn't have both go the correct direction.
[127.36 → 128.30] It could have been disastrous.
[128.70 → 130.30] Because we're not going to miss the WAN show.
[130.44 → 133.66] So it would just be me and Luke unconscious in our chairs for the next three hours.
[135.12 → 136.78] Wake up. Mild concussion. Keep going.
[136.78 → 143.74] All right. So you guys had some questions about how does LTT make money video.
[143.74 → 149.88] And I'm not sure if we will answer all of them because I have not yet had a chance to read this document.
[150.06 → 155.16] I've been busy all day getting ready for our infrastructure test at Smash Champs.
[155.38 → 159.26] I guess we'll have to be talking about that because that is where Luke and I are going after this.
[159.26 → 165.18] Because what better way to test the infrastructure for a LAN facility than to play video games all night.
[165.38 → 165.52] Yeah.
[165.68 → 167.76] I mean, there's really no other way to do it.
[167.88 → 168.06] Yeah.
[168.16 → 169.48] It's a tough job, but.
[170.24 → 172.78] I guess we'll have to be there.
[172.92 → 173.76] We'll soldier through.
[173.98 → 174.10] Yeah.
[174.22 → 174.72] We will.
[175.02 → 175.14] Yeah.
[175.14 → 176.42] All right. So here we go.
[176.50 → 182.60] On March 25th, Linus Media Group Inc. uploaded the truth about how LTT makes money.
[182.84 → 188.06] A video featuring several members of the team breaking down several income streams that contribute to LMG's revenue.
[188.06 → 195.66] Naturally, this spawned some discussion in our official but officially recognized Subreddit as well as on the LTT forum.
[195.84 → 199.20] And we thought we would try to address some of the speculation.
[200.12 → 204.96] Speculation number one from you slash just and Nick.
[206.88 → 217.00] Attempted a breakdown showing that they did the math because they're able to see our float plane subscriber count and the percentage of the chart that was float plane.
[217.00 → 226.58] And extrapolate from there, guessing that our revenue number is somewhere between 32.6 and 65.3 million dollars.
[227.60 → 229.50] Elijah responded to the post saying,
[229.50 → 231.50] All I will say is this.
[232.02 → 236.88] If it was this simple to figure out the number, we probably wouldn't have included that in the video.
[237.12 → 239.78] There are several factors not taken into account.
[240.30 → 244.38] Also, the range you just gave was f***ING massive LMAO.
[244.38 → 251.70] However, I will add to Elijah's response that, yeah, it probably is somewhere in that range.
[252.66 → 259.18] There's actually, there are factors to it that help it be higher and there are factors to it that help it be lower.
[259.30 → 264.82] One of the help it is lower ones is that I don't think this person factored in OG subs, which are actually $3.
[265.36 → 266.60] Yeah, and we have a fair amount.
[266.64 → 267.86] How many OG subs do we have?
[267.92 → 268.48] Quite a few.
[268.48 → 270.20] Like hundreds or thousands?
[270.70 → 271.50] Not hundreds.
[271.94 → 273.02] Definitely not hundreds.
[273.48 → 274.50] A lot more than hundreds.
[274.82 → 275.12] That's too bad.
[277.08 → 282.44] And those $3 subs really, wow, do they ever not...
[282.44 → 283.50] They don't cost us money.
[283.54 → 284.30] We make money off of them.
[284.34 → 286.20] Yeah, but they don't add up as fast as the other ones.
[286.20 → 287.92] The other ones just do a lot better, yeah.
[288.30 → 291.44] Because it's like delta over your costs, right?
[291.64 → 291.98] Yes.
[292.22 → 295.10] So when it, yeah, anyway, I don't need to explain that.
[295.10 → 300.82] And the $3 subs also have more overhead associated with collecting that payment because every
[300.82 → 304.66] payment has a fixed cost as well as a percentage of the overall transaction.
[304.92 → 305.16] So...
[305.16 → 308.46] Yeah, a higher percentage of it is like transaction fees and stuff like that.
[308.52 → 310.22] So like it doesn't even, it doesn't even make it to us.
[310.28 → 311.64] It just goes to PayPal or Stripe.
[311.72 → 315.94] Basically, with how much you pay and fees and taxes and overhead, you might as well just
[315.94 → 316.58] not even run it.
[316.78 → 317.56] Why am I even here?
[318.30 → 319.00] You know what?
[319.58 → 320.46] It's just not.
[321.10 → 322.00] Pitches the headphones.
[322.60 → 324.96] Another thing that I would say though is, so, okay.
[324.96 → 326.72] We lowered the range a little bit there.
[327.04 → 330.50] But another thing that I would say to increase the range is that we're not the only creator
[330.50 → 331.44] on the platform.
[332.36 → 336.02] And there are other creators contributing to that pie.
[336.06 → 337.30] Some of them vary significantly.
[337.70 → 337.86] So...
[337.86 → 337.96] Yeah.
[338.58 → 339.56] So, yeah.
[339.66 → 340.30] Dank pods.
[341.48 → 343.86] Dank pods has quite a few subscribers.
[343.88 → 345.86] I had something upside down stuck in my throat there.
[346.24 → 346.68] Yeah.
[346.68 → 351.94] There's actually a decent amount of creators on Flow plane that I like just really actively
[351.94 → 353.24] watch their content on Flow plane.
[353.62 → 353.92] Yeah.
[354.04 → 355.04] Which is like kind of sick.
[355.10 → 356.32] Well, yeah, because Flow plane's kind of cool.
[356.40 → 356.58] Yeah.
[356.68 → 359.04] And I mean, you don't have to subscribe to all of them.
[359.56 → 359.80] Yeah.
[359.80 → 360.04] Do you?
[360.04 → 360.52] I have.
[360.72 → 361.26] Do you?
[361.34 → 361.54] Yeah.
[361.54 → 361.64] Really?
[361.78 → 362.02] Okay.
[362.14 → 362.36] You...
[362.36 → 368.12] If I follow a channel for technical reasons, I won't pay for the sub.
[368.22 → 368.46] Okay.
[368.66 → 372.26] But if I'm like, I want to support this creator, I'll, yeah, I'll just pay for the sub.
[372.76 → 374.04] I'd have to if it was on Patreon.
[374.36 → 374.78] Very cool.
[374.88 → 375.42] So, like...
[375.42 → 375.66] Yeah.
[375.90 → 376.04] I don't know.
[376.06 → 376.64] No, that's the...
[376.64 → 379.48] It's the right thing to do, I would think.
[382.32 → 382.80] Speculation number...
[382.80 → 383.80] So, like, there's one.
[385.06 → 387.30] I have at a time directly subscribed.
[387.46 → 388.64] I don't know if I am right now.
[388.70 → 389.86] That's the main LTT channel.
[390.86 → 391.12] Go ahead.
[391.12 → 395.96] I have at a time been directly subscribed to Dank Pods, for instance, because there was
[395.96 → 398.68] a while where my sleep schedule was all whack.
[399.02 → 403.42] So, I was awake more often when he was actively streaming, and I would just have his drum stream
[403.42 → 404.68] in the background while I was working.
[405.06 → 406.96] So, it was like, yeah, I mean...
[406.96 → 407.58] Nice.
[407.66 → 410.96] I'm just actually watching this, like, for fun content.
[411.58 → 412.26] So, it makes sense.
[412.46 → 413.08] That's understandable.
[413.30 → 413.44] Yeah.
[413.56 → 414.36] I mean, Wade's super cool.
[414.52 → 414.64] Yeah.
[415.20 → 416.28] Speculation number two.
[416.28 → 422.36] Since some channels contributed so little, that's why they were shut down.
[422.36 → 431.86] So, the reference here is, of course, to the not LTT or short circuit or tech linked channels,
[431.86 → 437.20] because you've got to remember, for most of last year, actually, even LMG Clips earns more
[437.20 → 438.44] than tech wiki game linked.
[439.40 → 441.02] I can address this in there somewhere.
[441.62 → 442.24] Channel's super fun.
[442.24 → 444.24] There is...
[444.24 → 445.24] There is...
[446.04 → 446.66] Okay, hold on.
[446.70 → 448.50] I'm going to read the official response first.
[451.20 → 452.60] It is worth noting...
[452.60 → 453.24] Ah, yes.
[453.34 → 453.52] Good.
[453.88 → 462.10] It is worth noting that that chart only shows AdSense, not sponsorships, which, when one
[462.10 → 468.42] channel uploads 15 videos over the course of an entire year, and another channel uploads
[468.42 → 474.06] almost, you know, two videos a day, in the case of LMG Clips, well, of course, that channel
[474.06 → 480.30] is going to make less AdSense, but there is more to the revenue of a channel than just
[480.30 → 484.30] AdSense, and that was one of the points that we were trying to drive home in this video,
[484.48 → 484.66] is...
[484.66 → 486.62] AdSense is like a smaller part of the pie these days.
[486.74 → 489.92] How does the creator economy work exactly?
[490.36 → 495.92] How do these numbers break down at an organization that isn't just a YouTube channel?
[495.92 → 497.64] And not every YouTube channel will follow...
[497.64 → 500.74] And I think we say this in the video, but not every YouTube channel will follow similar
[500.74 → 502.68] splits to what we have.
[503.24 → 503.42] No.
[503.42 → 504.16] But this is ours.
[504.36 → 504.94] No, not at all.
[505.00 → 505.72] But this is ours.
[506.98 → 512.74] Point number two on this one is the shutting down of the channels was never about the money.
[512.94 → 518.26] I made that explicitly clear at the time, and I know that there is a cohort of people
[518.26 → 522.02] that believe that every time I open my mouth, I am lying.
[522.44 → 524.12] That is not, in fact, the case.
[524.12 → 529.16] If I say it wasn't about the money, I can't tell you what it was about.
[529.34 → 534.32] It means it wasn't about the money, but I can't give you any more detail about what
[534.32 → 535.70] exactly it was about.
[537.26 → 543.36] At the end of the day, we made a decision to pause the production, to focus on the areas
[543.36 → 547.82] we needed to focus on and make LMG as awesome as it can possibly be.
[547.82 → 549.34] All right.
[550.62 → 554.72] Speculation number three was that we should have just said how much money we make in the
[554.72 → 554.98] video.
[556.14 → 559.06] Some people said big companies show their revenue all the time.
[559.22 → 560.04] Why can't LMG?
[560.04 → 560.12] LEG?
[560.60 → 565.26] And the answer is that because those publicly traded companies, by law, are required to
[565.26 → 568.32] disclose certain aspects of their finances for their shareholders.
[568.66 → 572.64] LMG is still a private company, and we don't have to go as far as we did.
[573.10 → 579.08] But we made a decision to do so, knowing that a lot of people, the ones who care anyway,
[579.30 → 581.44] are going to go and do the math for themselves anyway.
[581.68 → 586.90] And realistically, coming back to speculation number one, probably end up in the right range
[586.90 → 587.24] or so.
[587.56 → 591.64] The thing that you guys don't know, of course, is what our expenses look like, what our overhead
[591.64 → 592.12] looks like.
[592.26 → 592.66] We have over...
[592.66 → 593.50] It's probably higher than you think.
[593.56 → 595.08] We have over 100 people on staff.
[595.24 → 603.08] Like we went from, I think in our first year, our total revenues were, ooh, I'm a little rusty
[603.08 → 603.38] on this.
[603.42 → 604.90] It was under a million dollars though.
[604.90 → 610.62] Our total top line revenue was under $1 million in our first year of operation.
[610.62 → 617.24] And nowadays, I'll say this.
[618.70 → 620.00] Oh, okay.
[620.10 → 621.90] How do I not get too specific?
[622.18 → 622.90] It's a lot more than that.
[623.18 → 631.68] Nowadays, depending on which period it's for, there are regularly pay periods where, whether
[631.68 → 637.14] it's with expense reimbursements or whatever else, I'm going to keep this fuzzy.
[637.14 → 643.56] And that's intentional, but there are regularly pay periods where the overall withdrawal from
[643.56 → 646.18] the company's coffers is greater than that.
[647.92 → 649.02] It happens.
[653.32 → 656.06] Sorry, by pay period, sorry, I mean a monthly, monthly.
[656.58 → 659.20] Back then we paid on a monthly basis.
[659.50 → 659.62] Okay.
[659.62 → 666.32] Um, so there are months when our overall payroll expense is greater than the entire
[666.32 → 668.68] revenue for the company in our first year of operation.
[668.84 → 673.84] Of course, in the first year, that wasn't a huge problem because the entire employee
[673.84 → 677.52] count was me, Luke, Ed, Brandon.
[678.30 → 679.90] Brandon didn't even start January 1st.
[679.96 → 680.36] No, no, no.
[680.40 → 682.44] He started in like April or something like that.
[682.50 → 686.96] Was it just the four of us after one year or had we added?
[686.96 → 689.20] Were we in the new house before the end of the year?
[689.74 → 690.34] We were.
[690.96 → 691.40] So.
[692.10 → 693.78] Oh, do you want to hear something scary?
[696.78 → 699.34] It is almost Colton's 10-year anniversary.
[701.22 → 702.50] Think about what that means.
[703.40 → 704.66] When did Colton start?
[706.54 → 708.20] Right before we moved to the office.
[708.98 → 709.42] Wow.
[711.02 → 712.10] Look at his face.
[712.46 → 713.64] Look at his face.
[713.64 → 718.06] I was, I was analyzing something that happened, and I was trying to like, I was looking at
[718.06 → 720.64] something, and I was like, okay, we shouldn't do this anymore.
[721.16 → 727.76] And then I was thinking back to, um, myself in a similar role in the past.
[727.82 → 728.10] Yeah.
[728.22 → 730.66] Because I was like, like, how should I address this?
[730.66 → 733.46] And I was like, well, like I've done this thing that we shouldn't do.
[733.80 → 736.76] So I'm trying to like put myself in those shoes to understand what it's like.
[736.76 → 736.94] Right.
[736.94 → 740.86] And then I had the thought of like, that was nine years ago.
[741.90 → 743.54] Because it was 2016.
[744.02 → 744.66] I know.
[744.82 → 747.78] Because I split off to do for myself in 2017.
[748.20 → 748.80] I know.
[748.92 → 752.94] And I looked at the date, and I was like, uh, uh, uh, what?
[753.80 → 754.92] Dude, it's wild.
[755.92 → 757.14] Dude, it's wild.
[757.68 → 763.26] Um, anyway, um, there were some, there were some other questions that people had, some other
[763.26 → 763.72] assumptions.
[763.72 → 767.82] We can talk about a little bit more if you guys want to leave a merch message, as you
[767.82 → 773.88] guys know from watching that video, if you did, um, merch, which I think is actually an
[773.88 → 778.32] unfair word to use to describe the products that our team creates, but our merchandise,
[778.62 → 782.62] uh, contributes an enormous amount of our company's revenues.
[782.62 → 788.68] I did see a lot of people talking about how there's a huge difference between revenue and
[788.68 → 789.10] profit.
[789.10 → 795.80] And I will say before anyone bothers to ask this one, there is a very good reason that
[795.80 → 800.26] we don't get into the profitability of each of those segments of the business.
[800.26 → 806.40] And the reason is that we actually can't really, at least not without adding a bunch of completely
[806.40 → 809.10] unnecessary administrative overhead.
[809.10 → 817.56] Like how on earth would I tell you guys exactly what the cost is of a tech of an actually tech
[817.56 → 821.94] linked would be relatively easy because there's a small team that works on that for a finite
[821.94 → 823.04] number of hours every day.
[823.04 → 827.58] But I'm like, what's the value of, uh, the earnings of one department floating another
[827.58 → 830.12] department while they cook for a while and then make tons of money?
[830.24 → 830.96] Well, okay.
[830.96 → 834.60] That, that we could kind of figure out, but what I'm, where I was getting with this is
[834.60 → 838.48] how do I determine the cost of an LTT video?
[839.34 → 840.94] There are so many parts of that.
[840.94 → 847.12] I would have to log every single hour of every single person involved from, uh, the, the business
[847.12 → 853.72] team talking to clients to procurement, sourcing product to the labs team, doing testing to the
[853.72 → 855.52] writing team, to the shooting team, to the editing.
[855.68 → 856.90] Involved the administrative stuff.
[856.90 → 861.10] Like did, did they talk about this in their, in their one-on-one with an executive?
[861.28 → 864.52] Did anyone in accounting have to do any reconciliations for it?
[864.70 → 864.90] Probably.
[865.64 → 866.04] Yeah.
[866.64 → 868.88] You could kind of try to approximate it.
[869.32 → 870.40] And sponsor money isn't free.
[870.50 → 871.88] A business person had to work to get it.
[871.98 → 873.04] And we kind of do.
[873.14 → 876.84] We kind of do try to approximate those things in order to make sure that every aspect of
[876.84 → 878.52] the business is running in a healthy manner.
[879.04 → 880.36] But clearly we're doing okay.
[880.48 → 886.04] But if our whole goal with this type of transparency with you guys is that it's supposed to be accurate,
[886.04 → 891.58] then the most accurate way for us to, to do it is to, to give you something that we can
[891.58 → 892.36] actually trust.
[892.50 → 894.30] Something that we know is actually accurate.
[894.30 → 898.76] So one of the things that a lot of people brought up is like, you know, Hey, with how
[898.76 → 904.48] much of the business is merged now over 50%, why do they even bother with the video side?
[904.98 → 906.72] But it's murkier than that, right?
[906.76 → 913.84] Because a lot of that apparel sales and product sales is driven by that video production business.
[913.84 → 918.40] It's just that we've chosen to allocate the revenue into buckets this way.
[918.50 → 921.30] There are easily other ways that we could allocate it.
[921.36 → 925.90] Like if we created internal tracking links that we put under every single video, we could
[925.90 → 930.92] potentially track merchandise sales right back to individual videos.
[930.92 → 935.40] And we could have like a P and L for every single video production that we do.
[935.48 → 939.60] But then, you know, we're going to have a team that sits there and runs all of this
[939.60 → 946.34] stuff, which a bigger business than us, you know, if we were 250 people or 500 people instead
[946.34 → 951.24] of about a hundred is, yeah, might actually make sense for us to continue to, you know,
[951.66 → 955.08] optimize and continue to, to do better or whatever.
[955.32 → 960.96] But right now, you know, we're, we're too busy doing stuff to analyze it to quite that
[960.96 → 961.32] degree.
[961.94 → 965.84] Another question that came up before you guys bother to send a merch message for this one
[965.84 → 972.60] is, Hey, um, to Linus with how little of it is actually here.
[972.66 → 972.84] Hold on.
[972.88 → 977.60] I'm going to see if I can find the, uh, the pie chart, uh, with how little of it is actually
[977.60 → 981.46] those, those in video, like pre-roll and end roll things.
[981.84 → 985.98] Um, why exactly do you bother including them?
[986.62 → 991.78] Um, can you just, can you just not do in video sponsor spots?
[991.78 → 1000.66] Um, it is a good question, and it is something that I have considered, but what I will say
[1000.66 → 1004.48] is that you got to remember guys, this is revenue.
[1004.84 → 1006.92] 9% of the pie really isn't anything.
[1007.14 → 1014.74] So if we were to take 9% of this out, this is a very low-cost aspect of our production,
[1014.74 → 1015.96] right?
[1016.40 → 1024.26] So we would be losing 9% of our revenue, but I'm just going to look at all the rest of
[1024.26 → 1024.84] this stuff.
[1025.92 → 1027.20] AdSense, sponsored projects.
[1027.20 → 1029.08] 9% is a massive section of the pie to just cut out.
[1029.08 → 1034.52] This is probably other than pasting affiliate links under videos.
[1034.94 → 1039.36] This is probably the lowest lift part of this entire pie.
[1039.58 → 1043.52] So you're not really asking us to cut out 9% of our revenue.
[1043.52 → 1045.90] You're asking us to cut out effectively 9%.
[1045.90 → 1050.28] Like you're effectively asking us to cut out 9% of our revenue.
[1050.38 → 1051.30] That was almost pure profit.
[1051.38 → 1051.46] Yeah.
[1051.46 → 1054.88] That slice is much closer to profit than practically anything.
[1054.88 → 1058.44] Whereas like if you were to look at something like CW, right?
[1058.72 → 1061.94] Like a huge chunk of this piece is just COGS.
[1062.54 → 1063.56] Cost of goods sold.
[1063.82 → 1069.34] Like it accounts for absolutely nothing other than us buying the product before we sell it
[1069.34 → 1069.68] to you.
[1070.28 → 1070.72] Huge.
[1070.72 → 1074.00] Then you've got, you know, tooling and development.
[1074.52 → 1077.26] Then you've got, you know, human resources.
[1077.46 → 1081.94] All of our products are designed here in Canada by our team here.
[1082.40 → 1086.92] So it's not like we're using just like cheap overseas labour, and we're just like still screening
[1086.92 → 1088.96] our logo onto a screwdriver or something.
[1088.96 → 1090.74] Like it's not like that.
[1090.76 → 1092.06] We're doing real design work.
[1092.06 → 1099.48] There's also, you know, because of the famous trust me bro guarantee that for whatever reason
[1099.48 → 1104.06] turned into a scandal, a significant amount of cost here in returns.
[1104.44 → 1104.92] There was a reason.
[1105.08 → 1106.10] Oh, there's a reason.
[1106.22 → 1110.50] But the reasons are far more complicated than just.
[1110.50 → 1114.36] I know you just, you just try to slip that in all the time.
[1114.88 → 1116.96] And I, you know, I do.
[1118.04 → 1119.96] You can trust me bro about that.
[1119.96 → 1126.28] The point is that, that is a significant cost that we bear here.
[1126.28 → 1130.12] So if you were to say, okay, Linus, stop doing creator warehouse.
[1130.12 → 1135.92] I don't know this off the top of my head, but I will say with some degree of confidence
[1135.92 → 1141.60] that the actual profitability of this is probably not that far off of this.
[1141.98 → 1142.08] Yeah.
[1142.92 → 1143.76] With that said.
[1143.76 → 1146.12] I mean, you could kind of say the same about AdSense, right?
[1146.18 → 1148.26] Like it's not, it's not, these aren't showing.
[1148.26 → 1148.92] Why don't we just turn that off too?
[1149.08 → 1149.28] Yeah.
[1149.50 → 1154.68] These aren't, these aren't showing necessarily all the stuff that goes into it because those
[1154.68 → 1159.26] like in video sponsored spots, AdSense, sponsored projects, those are laying on top
[1159.26 → 1160.74] of the video production crew.
[1160.90 → 1161.18] Yes.
[1161.62 → 1165.26] And in video sponsored spots is also laying on top of the video production crew.
[1165.40 → 1165.56] Yeah.
[1165.64 → 1170.94] So if we were just making the videos, right, our costs are the same regardless of whether
[1170.94 → 1174.76] we have AdSense and in video sponsored spots.
[1176.34 → 1178.94] So I have thought about it.
[1179.28 → 1183.80] I have never gotten as far as discussing that as a possibility with the rest of the team.
[1185.10 → 1188.68] Unique username says now I really want a profitability chart, but I can't.
[1188.68 → 1191.38] Because there are so many resources here.
[1191.74 → 1196.26] Like our, our, our talent and culture coordination team.
[1197.20 → 1197.60] HR.
[1197.94 → 1200.00] Like our HR team, our accounting team.
[1200.10 → 1201.06] How do I allocate them?
[1201.34 → 1204.38] Like the accounting team does work for like smash champs sometimes.
[1204.82 → 1207.80] Do they log every one of those hours in a log book?
[1207.92 → 1209.62] Does somebody audit that log book?
[1209.70 → 1211.04] Like, come on, come on.
[1211.14 → 1212.60] We don't need to do that.
[1212.64 → 1213.40] We don't have time for that.
[1213.74 → 1214.72] That's one of the major.
[1214.72 → 1216.80] Some of it kind of does work that way, actually.
[1216.80 → 1218.24] Like, yes, I know some does.
[1218.48 → 1218.60] Yeah.
[1218.96 → 1220.24] Some of the development in particular.
[1221.42 → 1221.86] However.
[1222.20 → 1223.06] Those are contractors.
[1223.28 → 1226.90] That's a workflow that contract developers are like.
[1226.94 → 1227.50] Kind of used to.
[1227.52 → 1227.98] Used to.
[1228.06 → 1229.26] Like that's just part of it.
[1229.56 → 1229.96] It all works.
[1230.54 → 1236.04] When you're just an employee for a company that shares all the same ownership team or
[1236.04 → 1241.96] ownership group, there's no good reason to do that unless there's like, unless we're
[1241.96 → 1245.48] trying to, unless we're trying to kind of root out waste in some way.
[1245.56 → 1247.80] Like, hey, is this project not making sense?
[1247.80 → 1250.08] Because we're like really spending a lot of time on this.
[1250.44 → 1254.12] Like if we're kind of doing an investigation, then I would say that we would, we would get
[1254.12 → 1255.24] into logging stuff like that.
[1255.24 → 1258.02] But just in terms of day-to-day operation, no, I don't think we would.
[1259.66 → 1260.58] Feel free to.
[1260.80 → 1262.86] Anyway, like I said, feel free to send some more merch messages.
[1262.86 → 1265.46] If you have more questions, we do have a discussion question here from Elijah.
[1265.60 → 1266.58] Can Elijah have a raise?
[1266.60 → 1271.38] Because he did such a good job with this video and now knows how much the company makes.
[1271.44 → 1271.62] Okay.
[1271.66 → 1272.52] So two things, Elijah.
[1272.62 → 1274.94] Number one is no, you don't know how much the company makes.
[1274.94 → 1276.98] We already talked about that because you only see the revenue.
[1277.20 → 1278.04] And number two, no.
[1278.34 → 1278.78] Get wrecked.
[1278.90 → 1281.20] Or maybe, but I'm actually not in charge of that.
[1281.20 → 1282.36] That was one of the big.
[1282.58 → 1283.06] Hasn't been for a bit.
[1283.34 → 1289.64] That was one of the big reasons that I wanted to let go of the leadership reins.
[1289.64 → 1297.30] Because the reality of it was, while I've talked about this in the past, I could be CEO of the company.
[1297.76 → 1302.20] I didn't have time to really know what everyone was doing.
[1303.20 → 1304.52] What everyone was doing.
[1304.80 → 1306.20] How good of a job they were doing.
[1306.46 → 1309.82] You know, did they deserve a raise?
[1309.82 → 1317.68] And then also be the primary host and that creative energy guy and sit on this podcast for three to four and a half hours a week.
[1317.72 → 1319.00] And like all the other things that I do.
[1319.14 → 1321.24] I didn't have time to do a good job.
[1321.76 → 1326.24] And so I'd be in these like annual reviews where we're talking about compensation.
[1327.20 → 1334.40] And it got to the point where I was like, if we get any bigger, I'm just going to be going on gut feel.
[1334.52 → 1335.38] Which is not okay.
[1335.98 → 1337.92] That's not good enough.
[1338.72 → 1339.68] And so, no.
[1339.78 → 1342.64] I do not determine Elijah's compensation.
[1343.22 → 1344.36] How has that been?
[1344.90 → 1346.10] Has it felt like a good?
[1346.36 → 1348.38] Because I know some things.
[1349.10 → 1350.10] I don't know this.
[1350.10 → 1356.00] I suspect some things you had hoped to let go of and probably weren't fully able to just because it is how it is.
[1356.06 → 1357.96] Not because someone wasn't doing things correctly.
[1358.48 → 1360.62] But I know that you were able to let go of.
[1360.72 → 1362.08] Has that felt like a weight off?
[1362.22 → 1363.62] It's been hard.
[1363.62 → 1369.66] Because there are cases where I've felt like I want to be involved.
[1369.66 → 1375.70] But part of letting go of something is that you have to actually let go.
[1376.26 → 1378.66] And the second that I have someone come to me.
[1378.90 → 1380.30] Like let's say you came to me.
[1380.56 → 1384.04] And you were like, hey, I'm not happy with my compensation.
[1384.58 → 1388.12] The second I took that, and I put my finger on the scale.
[1388.12 → 1390.84] Now I'm basically in charge of it again.
[1391.40 → 1392.20] Think about it, right?
[1392.24 → 1395.60] Because the second you do that, someone else is going to do that.
[1395.94 → 1397.56] And then someone else is going to do that.
[1397.76 → 1400.42] And then Taryn's going to be sitting there going, okay, well, what is the point?
[1400.52 → 1406.84] Of even putting together these performance metrics and these reviews and these management layers and this budgeting.
[1406.84 → 1414.72] Why am I even doing any of this if Linus is just going to come in and say, oh, yeah, well, like Luke's kind of my buddy outside of like the work that he does.
[1415.06 → 1415.94] And do it this way.
[1416.02 → 1417.04] Like he's blonde.
[1417.46 → 1418.96] So like that's cool.
[1419.68 → 1421.92] You know, I mean, that's a problem in its own right.
[1421.92 → 1426.22] But like he's sexy.
[1426.78 → 1428.88] So, you know, right?
[1428.98 → 1430.72] Like it's ridiculous.
[1432.38 → 1434.28] So it's probably good that you don't do those things.
[1434.28 → 1442.26] So, you know, look, and it's, and it's one of those things where Luke's and my relationship is particularly complicated because we are friends, and he has talked to me about his compensation.
[1442.26 → 1451.14] But what I have to do is I have to basically say, okay, I am taking off my company hat and I feel like, and you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[1451.38 → 1462.76] I feel like I have given you from the benefit of my experience friend advice that is not necessarily aligned with the corporation's best interests.
[1463.26 → 1465.12] I would also like to.
[1465.44 → 1466.50] So I agree.
[1466.68 → 1468.52] I would also like to put forward.
[1468.92 → 1471.70] Yeah, I think I came to those conversations looking for that.
[1472.28 → 1473.24] Yeah, not the other side.
[1473.40 → 1473.92] A hundred percent.
[1474.04 → 1474.92] So I think it worked out great.
[1475.12 → 1477.48] It is a very weird and complicated relationship.
[1477.62 → 1479.24] I think it really is a pretty good job.
[1479.42 → 1479.66] We try.
[1480.00 → 1482.10] But sometimes it doesn't work out perfectly.
[1482.30 → 1490.72] But what I didn't do and what I wouldn't do is take what he told me as a friend and raise it up the flagpole.
[1490.84 → 1495.00] Which I also didn't want to take it up the chain because that's not the way that's supposed to work.
[1495.00 → 1497.32] The way it's supposed to work is if Luke has a concern.
[1497.42 → 1500.62] And I'm not saying Luke was complaining about his own pay.
[1500.62 → 1503.56] What I'm saying is that something to do with compensation.
[1503.84 → 1508.28] Luke had a concern that he wasn't sure how to approach, and he wanted to talk to me as a friend.
[1508.46 → 1509.34] So we did.
[1510.26 → 1511.34] But I can't.
[1511.42 → 1513.60] I can't put my thumb on the scale.
[1513.88 → 1516.94] Because it's like it's and this is a mistake even necessarily one of those scenarios.
[1516.94 → 1518.96] And I have struggled with this.
[1519.94 → 1525.26] And I've tried to coach people who manage people under me on this same thing.
[1525.58 → 1526.58] I struggle with it now.
[1526.66 → 1527.84] I will probably always struggle with it.
[1528.02 → 1530.48] You have to let certain things like fail.
[1531.38 → 1531.60] Yeah.
[1531.76 → 1532.04] Oh, yeah.
[1532.16 → 1532.60] Oh, God.
[1532.60 → 1533.50] Oh, dude, it's so hard.
[1533.66 → 1534.20] It's so painful.
[1534.20 → 1541.70] Think about the number of ideas that you've either pitched me or heard pitched to me that I've been like, I do not believe this will work.
[1542.16 → 1543.52] But try anything twice.
[1543.74 → 1544.24] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1544.26 → 1545.78] How many times have you heard me say those words?
[1545.92 → 1546.48] Quite a few times.
[1546.64 → 1548.50] Like, I don't think I could count it.
[1548.64 → 1550.08] You can't fit it on hands.
[1550.72 → 1551.82] I don't know how many times.
[1552.14 → 1553.38] It's so hard.
[1553.38 → 1554.38] And it is tough.
[1555.44 → 1563.54] But like, and you have to also understand that when you're on the like receiving end of that, that, and I'm not saying this is one of those scenarios.
[1563.82 → 1564.04] Yeah.
[1564.40 → 1569.22] But in all of these scenarios, like anything that Linus had to give up, I think, can I say this?
[1569.54 → 1570.02] I don't know.
[1570.04 → 1570.90] You can say anything you want.
[1570.98 → 1571.54] It's a free country.
[1571.86 → 1572.26] I think.
[1572.30 → 1572.76] What am I going to do?
[1572.80 → 1573.06] Fire you?
[1573.06 → 1574.34] A problem that we had.
[1574.42 → 1574.76] Yeah.
[1574.84 → 1577.88] When you and Yvonne were holding certain positions.
[1578.12 → 1578.32] Sure.
[1578.32 → 1581.66] Was that you guys wouldn't let certain things sometimes fail too much.
[1581.72 → 1582.00] Oh, yeah.
[1582.00 → 1582.36] Yeah.
[1582.80 → 1586.16] And then that like limits people's growth potentials.
[1586.26 → 1586.36] Yeah.
[1586.36 → 1596.22] So sometimes you have to like, as a manager, you have to weigh the like, what is the loss of letting this thing fail versus the actual real loss of this person not learning this thing.
[1596.26 → 1598.42] Dude, people have to learn things for themselves.
[1598.60 → 1598.74] Yeah.
[1598.94 → 1599.88] Do you know how many things?
[1599.88 → 1600.58] You can't just tell people.
[1600.66 → 1601.84] Dude, the number of things.
[1601.92 → 1602.08] Okay.
[1602.26 → 1602.56] Okay.
[1603.04 → 1604.22] Here's a perfect example.
[1604.34 → 1609.62] Here's a perfect example that completely changed the trajectory of my life.
[1609.90 → 1610.16] Okay.
[1610.16 → 1612.16] Okay.
[1612.16 → 1612.64] When I was going into school.
[1612.76 → 1613.04] Okay.
[1613.04 → 1616.96] I joined the science program at UBC, and I was like, I don't know.
[1617.12 → 1620.84] I'll do whatever it is that science people do.
[1621.02 → 1623.50] And like, I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career.
[1623.50 → 1627.58] I knew that you're supposed to have a degree because that's what my generation was told.
[1628.14 → 1631.90] And also a high school diploma was worthless by the time I got one.
[1632.38 → 1634.34] And so I went to university.
[1634.34 → 1639.96] I like, I got to, went to a good school and I went to science because I mean, that'll look good on my resume.
[1639.96 → 1640.28] Right.
[1640.80 → 1647.18] And my uncle told me, so my uncle says, look, you're making a mistake.
[1647.82 → 1649.06] Go into business.
[1649.06 → 1650.06] I'm going to do business.
[1650.06 → 1650.70] I'm going to do business.
[1650.70 → 1652.14] Because everything is business.
[1652.24 → 1659.82] I went, uncle Skip, he's always, he's always pushing this business agenda, but I'm going to do science.
[1660.46 → 1663.00] And he was a hundred percent right.
[1663.16 → 1665.96] I didn't understand what business was.
[1666.06 → 1667.46] No, it sounded boring.
[1667.50 → 1668.78] It sounded like wearing a suit.
[1668.98 → 1669.18] Yeah.
[1669.18 → 1672.84] I had no idea that business can be plumbing.
[1673.88 → 1674.94] It'd be like literally anything.
[1675.04 → 1676.78] It could be literally anything.
[1677.08 → 1678.00] You can use business.
[1678.14 → 1681.60] Like some of the best stuff I learned at BIT when I was taking a development course.
[1681.78 → 1682.02] Yeah.
[1682.12 → 1684.86] Was the mandatory business courses that came along with it.
[1684.90 → 1685.00] Yeah.
[1685.00 → 1687.36] Because they were like communications and other things like that.
[1687.58 → 1690.56] And I used those more than probably anything else I learned at that school.
[1690.74 → 1691.98] I never used Java.
[1692.26 → 1694.68] I didn't, I didn't program in Java professionally ever.
[1694.84 → 1697.44] And I don't know, but I used all the business courses.
[1697.44 → 1702.86] Because like, so to the plumber example, you can be a plumber and you can make a salary.
[1703.52 → 1712.48] Or you can run a plumbing business, and you can make, if you are successful, which will take some work, some luck, right?
[1713.04 → 1717.16] If you are successful, you can make many times a salary.
[1717.34 → 1718.22] And that was his point.
[1718.52 → 1720.08] His point was no matter what you do.
[1720.08 → 1725.82] Even if, even if you go somewhere and earn a salary, you can use those things you learned in business to help accelerate your career.
[1725.82 → 1734.36] Like it's working within that organization and being useful within that organization can be amplified by understanding business stuff.
[1735.66 → 1739.04] So yeah, that was, that was a thing that changed my life, but I had to.
[1739.16 → 1739.56] Sorry, sorry.
[1739.70 → 1741.78] PK seven said, I'm going to slightly modify.
[1741.90 → 1743.18] Oh no, it's exactly what he said.
[1743.26 → 1745.28] Or you can become a farmer and make a celery.
[1745.28 → 1748.38] Do the thing.
[1750.08 → 1751.52] I was thinking about it.
[1751.80 → 1752.68] My hand was hovering.
[1752.88 → 1753.96] I'm never going with this.
[1754.32 → 1754.76] Okay.
[1754.88 → 1757.58] So the point is that he explained it to me.
[1757.66 → 1760.64] He told me everything that I'm telling you guys now.
[1760.92 → 1765.56] I have no new information than I had.
[1765.98 → 1766.08] Yeah.
[1766.08 → 1771.48] But what I have is knowledge, which is what I value a lot more than my car.
[1772.52 → 1773.22] We don't have any books.
[1773.22 → 1773.88] We got some books.
[1774.36 → 1775.68] We got some Star Wars books.
[1775.68 → 1776.72] We got some Jedi path.
[1777.40 → 1778.44] Why is that there?
[1778.48 → 1778.98] Is that yours?
[1779.08 → 1780.58] Did you like order that and forget it here or something?
[1780.58 → 1781.70] I have no idea whose it is.
[1781.76 → 1783.36] Why are there Star Wars books there?
[1783.36 → 1783.88] Do you want to get them?
[1783.90 → 1784.54] They've been here forever.
[1784.68 → 1784.84] Yeah.
[1784.98 → 1787.24] I don't know how long these have been here.
[1787.66 → 1788.96] You're sure they're not yours.
[1789.06 → 1789.46] I don't.
[1789.50 → 1792.00] Because you totally read like trashy Star Wars literature.
[1792.12 → 1792.30] Yeah.
[1792.30 → 1794.40] And you totally get your stuff shipped to the office.
[1794.58 → 1796.16] I don't think I would have bought this though.
[1796.66 → 1797.90] How sure are you?
[1799.48 → 1800.64] Not 100% sure.
[1800.76 → 1802.68] But if I did buy it, it would have been a long time ago.
[1803.16 → 1803.54] It's yours.
[1803.60 → 1804.62] I don't care about it.
[1805.82 → 1806.62] My set deck.
[1806.70 → 1807.32] He'll read it.
[1810.12 → 1811.92] From the camera angle we never use.
[1811.92 → 1813.86] Are you sure it's not supposed to actually be set deck?
[1814.00 → 1815.26] Like I feel like I should probably leave it here.
[1815.42 → 1816.90] I don't know why it's in cellophane then.
[1817.36 → 1820.18] Fowler asks, I'll ask this here in float plane chat.
[1820.18 → 1825.40] Can you empathize with those of us who miss you being more unguarded like you were in the past?
[1825.80 → 1830.76] Now it seems like with Taryn being so guarded, part of the allure of getting to know Business Insider Things is gone.
[1830.90 → 1832.30] Which is one of the reasons I've been a fan.
[1832.98 → 1834.50] Am I being guarded right now?
[1834.72 → 1835.18] I don't.
[1835.24 → 1837.96] And I don't think Taryn being here would be the reason for that change.
[1838.12 → 1840.78] I also don't personally think Taryn is super guarded.
[1841.36 → 1841.60] No.
[1842.24 → 1843.84] To be honest, I think that's a misread.
[1844.28 → 1844.54] Yeah.
[1844.68 → 1846.16] I mean, he's not as accessible.
[1847.24 → 1847.60] Sure.
[1847.82 → 1849.74] Because he's not on WAN show every week.
[1849.86 → 1850.00] Sure.
[1850.18 → 1851.54] But that doesn't mean he's guarded.
[1851.80 → 1852.06] No.
[1852.38 → 1853.52] No, it just means he's...
[1853.52 → 1856.64] But I can understand why they have the perception.
[1856.76 → 1857.02] Sure.
[1857.22 → 1857.96] That he's not as...
[1857.96 → 1860.00] I'm just pointing out there that I don't think it's true.
[1860.08 → 1862.26] Like I'm pretty readily available.
[1862.58 → 1863.08] I am...
[1863.08 → 1863.38] Yes.
[1863.80 → 1869.60] Like whenever I see a message somewhere about how impossible Linus is to get in touch with,
[1869.68 → 1871.22] I'm like, yo, you didn't try that hard.
[1871.38 → 1871.62] Yeah.
[1871.62 → 1874.46] Like I am not that hard to get my attention.
[1874.68 → 1877.80] It's possible that you had a terrible, terrible idea.
[1878.02 → 1878.18] I'm easy to find.
[1878.18 → 1878.26] I'm fine.
[1878.90 → 1882.22] And so I didn't acknowledge it, but I might have seen it.
[1882.70 → 1885.42] In fact, depending on where you put it, I probably saw it.
[1885.68 → 1886.22] But I'll have...
[1886.22 → 1890.64] Dude, I'll have people say how hard I am to get in touch with, and they literally haven't
[1890.64 → 1893.26] emailed the public email address on our YouTube channel.
[1893.74 → 1893.92] Yeah.
[1894.00 → 1895.14] They haven't posted on the forum.
[1895.62 → 1896.30] Like they just...
[1896.30 → 1897.44] They didn't even try.
[1897.44 → 1902.52] I've had situations like that before with myself, and I don't even know if I'm as easy to contact
[1902.52 → 1905.34] as you are, but there's some pretty obvious ways to get a hold of me.
[1905.50 → 1907.24] There are ones that don't work.
[1907.46 → 1908.22] Like I don't...
[1908.22 → 1911.56] I do not get notifications for DMs on Twitter, for instance.
[1911.56 → 1912.32] Your DMs are open?
[1912.80 → 1914.42] Yeah, but I don't look at them.
[1914.46 → 1914.58] Yeah.
[1914.62 → 1915.64] See, mine a little harder.
[1915.74 → 1916.52] My DMs are not open.
[1916.76 → 1917.18] Oh, okay.
[1917.26 → 1918.12] But you can tweet at me.
[1918.32 → 1918.50] Wow.
[1918.50 → 1920.14] Are you just like too cool and too popular?
[1920.38 → 1921.56] It's like this guy, man.
[1921.56 → 1925.66] He's got his Steam friends offline by default because he's just too cool and popular, and
[1925.66 → 1928.26] people will like want to game with him because he's too cool.
[1928.94 → 1929.82] He's so popular.
[1930.10 → 1930.98] Oh, my goodness.
[1931.66 → 1933.86] So I could never like to find him in my list.
[1934.04 → 1935.12] You can just favourite people.
[1935.14 → 1935.36] I set you as a favourite.
[1935.50 → 1935.60] Yeah.
[1935.86 → 1936.74] Oh, so...
[1936.74 → 1937.36] Wow.
[1937.62 → 1941.86] So you think you deserve to be a favourite because you're too cool and popular.
[1941.86 → 1942.80] You're favourite online.
[1942.80 → 1946.22] Because you're too cool and popular to be ever online.
[1946.44 → 1947.44] I don't search for you.
[1947.58 → 1948.36] I see how it is.
[1948.64 → 1949.26] My goodness.
[1949.54 → 1950.44] I see how it is.
[1950.60 → 1951.20] My goodness.
[1951.20 → 1952.26] He's just too cool and popular.
[1952.46 → 1956.70] I mean, look, all we have to do is look at any kind of controversy, right?
[1956.90 → 1959.86] And it's like Linus bad, Luke cool and popular.
[1960.34 → 1961.84] Why does he hang out with that Linus guy?
[1961.92 → 1964.48] Maybe it's because of actions and words.
[1966.52 → 1966.88] Wow.
[1968.52 → 1969.44] See, he's mean.
[1971.18 → 1973.08] He just does it with a big smile.
[1973.26 → 1975.40] So you're all like, oh, Luke, he's so funny.
[1975.60 → 1976.46] That was mean.
[1977.44 → 1979.16] He hurt my feelings just now.
[1979.54 → 1980.40] No, I don't have feelings.
[1980.40 → 1981.04] I'm a narcissist.
[1981.70 → 1982.34] I was going to say...
[1982.34 → 1982.74] Or is he a sociopath?
[1983.46 → 1984.78] What have I been accused of?
[1984.82 → 1985.98] No, just narcissism, right?
[1986.14 → 1987.60] Has anyone called me a sociopath yet?
[1987.66 → 1988.02] Probably.
[1988.18 → 1988.50] Probably.
[1988.68 → 1989.24] I have no idea.
[1989.38 → 1989.92] You know what?
[1989.94 → 1990.98] I'm going to search the channel.
[1991.12 → 1992.00] There are a lot of words out there.
[1992.06 → 1996.10] I'm going to search the channel for comments that contain sociopath.
[1996.94 → 1997.94] You can't get out ahead of it.
[1997.98 → 1998.96] I'm going to do it too fast.
[1998.96 → 2004.78] What are we supposed to be doing right now?
[2005.14 → 2007.96] I think we're still on the how to make money topic.
[2008.10 → 2008.60] Oh, okay.
[2008.66 → 2008.90] Hold on.
[2009.00 → 2012.22] Elijah had one more conversation question.
[2012.80 → 2017.50] Do you think being as transparent as we've been as a company has shot us in the foot?
[2017.68 → 2017.94] Yeah.
[2017.94 → 2018.02] Yeah.
[2019.06 → 2019.42] Yes.
[2020.72 → 2022.08] That shot us in the foot for the future.
[2022.18 → 2023.24] This applies to several aspects.
[2023.40 → 2025.52] Sponsor relationships, finances, product development, etc.
[2025.58 → 2025.96] Oh, no.
[2026.28 → 2027.84] Not to those things, to be honest.
[2027.84 → 2028.28] Yeah, no.
[2028.42 → 2028.80] Just...
[2028.80 → 2029.88] Mostly community stuff.
[2029.88 → 2030.24] Yeah, no.
[2030.30 → 2030.64] It's just...
[2030.64 → 2037.44] It's always amazing to me to see people turn a W into an L, you know, and take something
[2037.44 → 2038.62] like that video that we did.
[2038.76 → 2040.46] And it's fine to ask more questions.
[2040.66 → 2042.62] I understand why people are curious, right?
[2042.92 → 2047.58] But some people seem to be legitimately angry that we didn't say more, that we didn't show
[2047.58 → 2047.84] more.
[2047.92 → 2049.58] If you do it at all, you didn't do it far enough.
[2049.92 → 2050.18] Yeah.
[2051.40 → 2052.94] Like, nah, f*** off.
[2053.20 → 2053.44] Yeah.
[2053.66 → 2054.02] Basically.
[2054.34 → 2054.56] Yeah.
[2054.74 → 2054.92] Yeah.
[2055.28 → 2056.68] Most people wouldn't have done this at all.
[2057.54 → 2058.36] Some people do it.
[2058.48 → 2059.46] There are other examples.
[2059.46 → 2059.74] Yeah.
[2059.82 → 2062.52] I mean, Mr. Beast is shockingly transparent.
[2063.04 → 2064.10] He doesn't have to be.
[2064.78 → 2064.90] Yeah.
[2066.80 → 2068.14] Is he publicly traded yet?
[2068.20 → 2068.96] I thought he's...
[2068.96 → 2070.36] Did he do a private sale of stock?
[2072.14 → 2072.54] Yeah.
[2072.64 → 2073.96] I think he sold privately.
[2073.98 → 2074.42] Private sale?
[2074.56 → 2074.70] Yeah.
[2075.12 → 2075.30] Yeah.
[2075.48 → 2076.02] That's...
[2076.02 → 2076.32] Oh, yeah.
[2076.32 → 2080.46] I was going to talk about that earlier, how one of the reasons that we've never taken
[2080.46 → 2086.22] outside money is because of how much less of that internal tracking nonsense we have
[2086.22 → 2089.92] to do when the ownership is identical for all the companies.
[2090.06 → 2090.20] Yeah.
[2090.34 → 2096.52] So I can say, you know, oh my goodness, we need a thing developed for LTT Store.
[2097.08 → 2099.10] Where on earth will I find a developer?
[2099.10 → 2100.10] Yeah.
[2101.34 → 2101.74] Yeah.
[2101.74 → 2106.28] The developers for LTT Store stuff, neither of them actually work for Linus Media Group.
[2106.46 → 2106.62] Yeah.
[2106.84 → 2112.40] So, and that's something that I think we're probably going to do like a restructuring.
[2112.66 → 2116.04] That's a terrifying word, but it's not going to be scary the way that we're doing it.
[2116.04 → 2121.64] But we're going to be doing like a restructuring at some point where we take some departments
[2121.64 → 2123.30] whole.
[2123.78 → 2124.02] Okay?
[2124.14 → 2124.84] Everyone chill.
[2125.12 → 2127.28] If you work here, and you're watching this, chill.
[2127.62 → 2128.48] There's a restructuring!
[2128.54 → 2128.82] I know.
[2128.98 → 2134.70] So we take some departments in their entirety, and then we shift what organization they actually
[2134.70 → 2135.34] work for.
[2135.54 → 2138.72] I think I might have even talked about this on WAN Show before, but we want to take some
[2138.72 → 2143.36] things like human resources, accounting, development, potentially.
[2143.36 → 2144.00] Oh, like parent company them.
[2144.04 → 2147.88] And make them a pooled resource, like customer service.
[2147.98 → 2148.42] Infrastructure.
[2148.58 → 2150.82] Is there any good reason why we have-
[2150.82 → 2152.04] Fragmented customer service.
[2152.04 → 2155.94] A different customer service team for Float plane and Creator Warehouse.
[2155.94 → 2160.14] I mean, everyone's job on both of those teams is basically to say yes.
[2160.74 → 2164.86] So, or say no if people are being completely unreasonable.
[2165.06 → 2165.56] I just mean-
[2165.56 → 2166.04] Which is pretty rare.
[2166.12 → 2168.26] I just mean the flows are pretty straightforward.
[2168.26 → 2170.80] We actually say yes to a lot of very unreasonable things.
[2170.96 → 2171.26] I know.
[2172.02 → 2173.08] Just so you know.
[2173.24 → 2173.66] I know.
[2173.86 → 2174.28] I know.
[2174.44 → 2175.78] That is the marching orders.
[2176.12 → 2183.88] I had a long conversation with another creator many years ago, many years ago, about how obviously,
[2183.88 → 2191.24] you know, we'd be in a position where regardless of our stated warranty policies, we'd be insane
[2191.24 → 2193.78] to step out of line in any way.
[2194.34 → 2194.44] Yeah.
[2194.44 → 2198.50] And, you know, this long conversation was very well understood.
[2198.74 → 2201.52] Very well understood by the other creator at the time.
[2202.00 → 2207.02] And, I don't know, somewhere along the line, someone got confused about it at some point.
[2207.02 → 2210.32] And, we had the trust me bro controversy.
[2211.02 → 2212.04] But, yeah.
[2212.24 → 2214.18] We would be, we'd be insane.
[2214.24 → 2219.44] I mean, look how, look how explosive things are when we actually, like, don't harm anybody.
[2220.44 → 2220.58] Yeah.
[2220.74 → 2221.44] Name a name.
[2221.72 → 2224.08] Name someone who didn't get warranty coverage on their backpack.
[2224.52 → 2225.38] Name a name.
[2226.68 → 2227.02] Me.
[2227.48 → 2227.78] Really?
[2228.16 → 2228.68] No.
[2229.46 → 2229.82] Really?
[2230.30 → 2230.74] All my carabiners are perfect.
[2230.74 → 2232.38] How many free backpacks do you have?
[2232.64 → 2233.10] Two.
[2234.36 → 2234.84] Three.
[2234.84 → 2234.90] Three.
[2234.90 → 2235.18] Three.
[2235.18 → 2235.24] Three.
[2235.24 → 2237.24] Three.
[2237.24 → 2237.90] F***ING guy.
[2238.00 → 2238.68] I got it wrong.
[2240.16 → 2240.72] Oh, man.
[2242.02 → 2242.38] Yeah.
[2244.10 → 2247.72] The one that I have that has the old carabiners, I think you even saw this.
[2247.80 → 2249.86] I'm on, like, a mission to not let them break.
[2251.42 → 2251.56] Really?
[2251.56 → 2256.46] And the only time one of them even got close was a TSA agent, like, put their thumb right
[2256.46 → 2256.68] through it.
[2256.68 → 2261.78] Is this just you, like, kind of doing that thing where, like, you just want the rare one no
[2261.78 → 2262.98] matter how much worse it is?
[2263.08 → 2263.44] Probably.
[2263.44 → 2263.52] Probably.
[2264.04 → 2264.36] Okay.
[2264.60 → 2265.76] But, yeah, I haven't replaced them.
[2265.86 → 2267.08] I totally could, obviously.
[2267.22 → 2267.48] Yeah.
[2267.60 → 2268.74] The new bag has them on it.
[2268.82 → 2269.00] Yeah.
[2269.02 → 2269.50] And they're great.
[2269.78 → 2270.02] Yeah.
[2270.56 → 2271.14] They're better.
[2271.30 → 2272.80] But my old ones are fine.
[2273.20 → 2273.48] Okay.
[2273.66 → 2274.22] They still work.
[2274.34 → 2274.70] Okay.
[2276.00 → 2278.90] Deslexicstoner240 says, Linus, you didn't give me a warranty.
[2279.58 → 2281.64] I also don't have a backpack.
[2284.72 → 2285.04] Nice.
[2285.92 → 2286.24] Okay.
[2286.90 → 2288.04] What do you want to talk about next?
[2288.04 → 2288.68] Oh, did I get it?
[2288.68 → 2290.12] Yes, I have the button, actually.
[2290.12 → 2292.92] I want to ask if I have the button.
[2293.52 → 2294.68] Do you have mine?
[2295.36 → 2295.72] Nice.
[2296.48 → 2298.54] That invalidates what he did.
[2298.82 → 2299.16] Yeah.
[2299.36 → 2300.40] I have the button, but I don't know.
[2304.98 → 2305.68] All right.
[2306.12 → 2307.66] What are we supposed to be doing, Dan?
[2308.34 → 2308.62] Do you have any idea?
[2308.62 → 2312.28] You could do another topic, or we could move into some merch messages.
[2312.36 → 2312.72] Up to you.
[2312.72 → 2313.72] No.
[2314.42 → 2315.22] It's not up to me.
[2315.40 → 2316.44] I don't decide these things.
[2316.60 → 2317.40] Let's do some merch messages.
[2317.40 → 2318.82] I'm not even the CEO anymore.
[2319.32 → 2319.74] That's right.
[2320.10 → 2321.32] But you're the vision, man.
[2322.12 → 2323.84] What is your vision for this WAN show?
[2324.06 → 2326.22] Your vision could be, Dan, tell me what to do.
[2326.36 → 2327.60] I always call him Eyeball Officer.
[2328.26 → 2328.78] I like it.
[2329.42 → 2330.70] I call him the Peepers.
[2330.70 → 2334.66] What a weird thing to call someone.
[2335.08 → 2336.72] The Peepers is crazy.
[2339.26 → 2341.24] What are the Peepers thinking about today?
[2341.52 → 2342.92] I've never heard that before.
[2343.54 → 2343.94] Wow.
[2346.20 → 2347.32] How about some announcements?
[2347.64 → 2348.48] Let's get through those.
[2348.56 → 2349.98] No, we should do another topic.
[2350.20 → 2350.40] That's wild.
[2350.76 → 2352.52] Yeah, we've only done one topic.
[2352.64 → 2353.48] How is that even possible?
[2353.54 → 2354.78] What do you think is this show?
[2355.04 → 2355.44] Who knows?
[2355.44 → 2360.38] I mean, certainly it's a show about detailed and accurate medical advice.
[2360.54 → 2361.18] That's for sure.
[2363.64 → 2365.12] Oh, my goodness.
[2367.40 → 2368.12] Yeah.
[2371.08 → 2372.14] All right.
[2372.34 → 2382.46] AMD says the RX 9070 XT sold 10 times more than its predecessor in the first week.
[2382.46 → 2388.00] Lisa Su dropped this claim in an interview with Asus Tony saying,
[2388.20 → 2389.92] it has been a fantastic success.
[2390.06 → 2397.02] Actually, it is the number one selling graphics card of all the AMD Radeon generations for first week sales by far.
[2397.22 → 2398.42] Ten times higher.
[2399.36 → 2404.24] This may be true for launch week, but does not necessarily indicate a successful quarter or year for AMD.
[2404.24 → 2416.24] This graph from John Petty Research shows a decline in sales for AMD's Halo products dating back to 2009.
[2418.84 → 2430.38] Basically, other than a little bit of uptick in the third attempt at rebrand.
[2430.44 → 2430.90] No, no, no.
[2430.98 → 2431.14] Okay.
[2431.20 → 2431.36] Sorry.
[2431.42 → 2431.70] Hold on.
[2431.70 → 2431.92] Okay.
[2431.98 → 2437.88] So this is the launch of Hawaii after multiple rebrands of...
[2437.88 → 2438.66] Oh, man.
[2438.68 → 2439.44] I'm trying to remember.
[2439.58 → 2442.12] Which one did they rebrand like a bazillion times?
[2442.14 → 2444.24] She said it's of all the Radeon generations, though.
[2444.28 → 2446.26] So that would be all the way back to 2009.
[2446.42 → 2450.08] So this is a like over fourfold increase.
[2450.24 → 2450.58] Hold on.
[2450.62 → 2450.86] Hold on.
[2450.90 → 2451.12] Hold on.
[2451.16 → 2451.36] Hold on.
[2451.36 → 2451.90] I'm trying to remember.
[2451.96 → 2454.60] Which one was the one that they rebranded like a zillion times?
[2454.86 → 2455.78] Oh, I don't know.
[2455.78 → 2457.64] I'm trying to remember.
[2457.76 → 2458.98] This they rebranded once.
[2459.52 → 2461.72] The 480 to the 580.
[2462.22 → 2464.76] But I thought it was the 7970, wasn't it?
[2464.78 → 2466.48] I thought it was 7970 or 7950.
[2466.58 → 2467.06] Didn't that care?
[2467.06 → 2468.46] Was it a Halo product that was rebranded?
[2468.54 → 2468.86] Yeah.
[2469.20 → 2469.44] Yeah.
[2469.52 → 2471.80] Oh, was it the 50...
[2471.80 → 2473.68] 5870?
[2474.12 → 2474.50] Come on.
[2474.54 → 2475.38] Help me out here, guys.
[2475.56 → 2478.52] There was one that got rebranded like three times.
[2479.52 → 2481.28] Someone's saying RX 380.
[2482.66 → 2483.06] Ah.
[2483.90 → 2484.26] Man.
[2484.32 → 2485.82] How do I not remember this anymore?
[2485.82 → 2486.86] 290 had a lot of rebrands, too.
[2486.96 → 2487.20] Yeah.
[2487.30 → 2487.98] But that's...
[2487.98 → 2488.32] Yes.
[2488.44 → 2489.08] I think that's before this.
[2489.10 → 2489.22] Yeah.
[2489.28 → 2490.92] The 290 did have a lot of rebrands.
[2490.92 → 2492.98] There was one before that, though.
[2494.32 → 2496.30] 7970 became the 280X.
[2497.84 → 2500.46] 7970 to 280 to 380.
[2500.72 → 2501.58] Oh, that's right.
[2501.88 → 2502.48] That's right.
[2502.48 → 2509.80] It was the 7970, which became part of the 200 series and then became part of the 300 series again.
[2509.96 → 2515.82] Like, that GPU was around flipping forever as a current part of their lineup.
[2516.02 → 2518.18] Oh, Atomic Brain Fart says 380 was different.
[2518.98 → 2520.48] I really thought they...
[2521.10 → 2521.86] I really...
[2521.86 → 2523.20] I really thought it was part of it.
[2524.04 → 2526.48] 7970, December 11th, and then became the 280X.
[2527.60 → 2531.38] It was rebranded as the R9 280X, essentially the same GPU, radio on R9 3.
[2531.38 → 2535.00] Okay, someone copy-pasted something into the chat, but it seems to have been truncated.
[2535.00 → 2536.02] I think it got cut off.
[2536.14 → 2536.82] That's really helpful.
[2537.38 → 2537.80] All right.
[2537.86 → 2539.20] Well, either way, cool.
[2539.44 → 2545.68] Anyway, so yeah, they've been in a long, steady decline, according to John Petty Research,
[2545.80 → 2550.60] for literally, like, 16 years.
[2550.60 → 2555.58] However, however, I see hope.
[2556.42 → 2557.14] I see hope.
[2557.22 → 2561.96] Like, you can see it just in publicly available data, like the number of reviews on products.
[2562.08 → 2566.78] Like, back in the Fury days, you'd look at these cards on New egg and, like, yeah, technically
[2566.78 → 2570.72] there are listings for them and there's, like, a couple in stock, but there'd be, like, six
[2570.72 → 2571.20] reviews.
[2571.74 → 2573.80] And that's over a span of, like, six months.
[2573.86 → 2577.16] So, in effect, nobody was buying these cards.
[2577.88 → 2581.42] But that does not seem to be the case with the 7000 series.
[2582.12 → 2587.78] It is worth noting that while the 9070XT is likely the top-end card from AMD this generation,
[2587.78 → 2593.14] it's not meant to be a top-of-the-line competitor like some of the other cards that were highlighted
[2593.14 → 2593.96] on that graph.
[2593.96 → 2598.26] With that said, it's a higher-end competitor than Polaris, for instance, which was meant
[2598.26 → 2600.44] to be more of a mid-range card.
[2601.26 → 2602.84] But that's, oh, man, I don't know.
[2602.90 → 2605.16] Is this meant to be positioned higher than Polaris?
[2605.60 → 2610.38] Because Polaris launched at, like, 250 bucks or, like, 199 or something like that.
[2611.24 → 2612.52] Don't quote me on those numbers.
[2612.60 → 2613.72] But it was, like, affordable.
[2614.36 → 2622.28] But then is, like, 549, 699, or 649, 699, is that, like, is that mid-range now?
[2622.28 → 2625.64] Well, I think disgustingly kind of...
[2625.64 → 2626.86] I didn't just hear that sigh.
[2626.94 → 2627.66] I felt it.
[2627.76 → 2627.96] Yeah.
[2628.78 → 2629.18] Anyway.
[2629.44 → 2630.64] It, like, actually bothers me.
[2630.72 → 2634.72] Because low-range users have kind of been priced out.
[2635.14 → 2635.28] Yeah.
[2635.40 → 2636.28] Like, the 60 series...
[2636.28 → 2636.58] Completely.
[2637.48 → 2640.28] Like, so there's kind of two things that have happened at the same time.
[2640.38 → 2642.78] One is the prices of graphics cards have massively ramped.
[2642.86 → 2645.22] Another one has been that, like...
[2645.22 → 2647.28] I don't know about you, but...
[2647.28 → 2653.80] When they first shifted to talking about, like, you know, 60, 70, 80 kind of series cards,
[2654.44 → 2658.26] we're talking about, like, after the 9800 series.
[2658.50 → 2658.72] Sure.
[2658.86 → 2660.82] So starting with the 200 series of cards.
[2661.38 → 2663.64] The 60 series was, like...
[2664.36 → 2666.92] It had a lot of focus, I feel like.
[2667.64 → 2667.92] Yeah.
[2668.02 → 2669.52] Generally won price to performance.
[2669.82 → 2671.22] Like, it was a very reasonable card to get.
[2671.34 → 2672.40] It was pretty solidly priced.
[2672.46 → 2674.62] It got you a perfect step up in generation every time.
[2674.62 → 2676.22] It was good.
[2676.42 → 2677.62] It was a good thing to buy.
[2677.90 → 2681.40] Just, yeah, if you just want to, like, game at 1080p medium to high,
[2681.76 → 2683.10] just, like, buy that every time.
[2683.46 → 2686.38] I don't know when that started getting eroded,
[2686.58 → 2688.06] but it feels like it has been.
[2688.42 → 2691.70] Well, the 2000 series didn't even, like...
[2691.70 → 2692.72] Oh, no, they got a 20...
[2692.72 → 2694.30] The 2060 kind of sucked, though.
[2694.46 → 2694.64] Yeah.
[2694.64 → 2698.62] Because the main highlight of the 60 series was...
[2699.24 → 2701.36] Or the 2000 series was that it had ray tracing.
[2701.36 → 2703.36] But the 2060...
[2703.36 → 2707.54] Yeah, you can play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on it.
[2707.58 → 2709.18] It's actually okay.
[2709.52 → 2710.74] But, like, barely.
[2711.16 → 2712.00] So you were...
[2712.00 → 2714.54] Compared to the 1660, right?
[2714.60 → 2717.64] Which was the non-RTX from that generation,
[2717.86 → 2720.22] but it's 16 series instead of 20 series...
[2720.22 → 2720.56] I don't know.
[2720.64 → 2722.36] Whatever they were doing with that branding.
[2722.36 → 2722.54] Yeah.
[2723.26 → 2726.00] That was honestly a way better value
[2726.00 → 2728.22] if you didn't care about ray tracing.
[2728.98 → 2731.90] And the 2060, even if you did care about ray tracing,
[2731.96 → 2733.58] it was barely really capable of it anyway.
[2734.24 → 2737.72] So that was, to me, where the 60 series kind of lost its lustre.
[2737.94 → 2739.84] But for me, the bigger conversation is, like,
[2739.86 → 2742.20] what the f*** happened to the 50 series?
[2743.12 → 2743.94] Yeah, fair enough.
[2744.08 → 2746.02] 50 also used to be a great value.
[2746.14 → 2747.00] Yeah, it was a solid card.
[2747.00 → 2748.54] Like, back with, like, Maxwell, right?
[2748.60 → 2752.64] Like, a 950 Ti or whatever was, like, a pretty solid card.
[2753.38 → 2755.68] Like, the 1050 was, like...
[2755.68 → 2756.50] Or 1050 Ti.
[2756.78 → 2758.36] I believe there was a 1050 Ti.
[2758.82 → 2759.36] Hold on.
[2759.48 → 2760.12] I'm pretty sure.
[2760.20 → 2761.52] And I'm pretty sure it was pretty solid.
[2762.14 → 2762.82] 1050 Ti.
[2763.16 → 2764.40] Yeah, there was a 1050 Ti.
[2764.46 → 2765.44] Yeah, that thing was solid.
[2766.00 → 2767.74] And, like, what was the MSRP when it launched?
[2769.94 → 2772.44] It was $139 US dollars.
[2772.78 → 2774.02] A solid card.
[2774.44 → 2775.74] For $139.
[2775.74 → 2776.42] $39.
[2776.76 → 2777.92] Like, this is what we lost.
[2778.12 → 2778.26] Yeah.
[2778.26 → 2779.16] Even look at the cooler.
[2779.28 → 2781.48] Like, the cooler even looks cool, if that's actually...
[2781.48 → 2782.04] That wasn't...
[2782.04 → 2783.36] I don't think that ever existed.
[2784.18 → 2785.94] Yeah, I never saw that.
[2786.40 → 2786.88] I know...
[2786.88 → 2789.14] I'm pretty sure those existed for 1060s.
[2789.16 → 2789.60] And I think...
[2789.60 → 2790.92] No, it says 1050 on there.
[2790.92 → 2791.20] Yeah, yeah.
[2791.24 → 2795.24] No, 1060s, definitely, you could buy ones that looked kind of like this.
[2796.74 → 2798.10] But this is...
[2798.10 → 2800.46] This effectively did not exist.
[2800.56 → 2801.42] It was all partner cards.
[2801.52 → 2802.20] Okay, okay, okay.
[2802.20 → 2802.36] Yeah.
[2802.36 → 2803.20] But...
[2803.20 → 2809.14] Someone says they still use 1050 Tis in slot machines.
[2809.44 → 2809.98] Nice.
[2810.40 → 2811.04] Nice.
[2811.14 → 2817.04] Anyway, speaking of somewhat maybe affordable cards, B580s are in stock.
[2817.04 → 2823.80] And this is not $250, which is what it was supposed to be, $250.
[2824.46 → 2824.86] Yeah.
[2825.56 → 2832.28] But $90 over MSRP feels less ridiculous than some of the stuff we're dealing with these days.
[2832.42 → 2836.86] Do you want to have a labs' website feature discussion?
[2837.72 → 2837.94] Yeah.
[2838.08 → 2839.28] I would love to.
[2839.28 → 2842.04] So we've been figuring out getting pricing on the site.
[2842.16 → 2842.44] Oh.
[2842.54 → 2844.32] Because there's been this...
[2844.32 → 2846.28] The discussion for quite a while now is like, how do we make...
[2847.90 → 2849.20] How do we get people...
[2849.20 → 2853.18] Not that we even really profit off of this, but we want the site to be more useful.
[2853.54 → 2857.12] Getting you to an actual purchasing decision is a form of...
[2857.12 → 2858.66] A very significant form of being more useful.
[2858.96 → 2859.12] Yeah.
[2859.12 → 2865.36] So one of the problems that we have is we want to include pricing.
[2865.68 → 2866.16] Yes.
[2866.16 → 2867.66] We haven't traditionally included pricing.
[2867.82 → 2867.98] Yep.
[2868.30 → 2869.64] And we've talked about this.
[2869.70 → 2875.12] I mean, going way back to the original roadmap meeting for the labs' website between me and
[2875.12 → 2879.76] Luke, we've talked about pricing, but it's not there yet, obviously.
[2880.12 → 2880.44] But...
[2880.44 → 2883.40] And there's a big reason why a lot...
[2883.40 → 2883.90] We...
[2883.90 → 2888.14] Like back when I was testing graphics cards, every single time in the review, there'd be
[2888.14 → 2888.80] price of performance.
[2888.80 → 2890.88] It was the graph everyone cared the most about.
[2891.30 → 2893.46] It was a graph that like we cared the most about.
[2893.60 → 2893.70] Yep.
[2894.44 → 2898.52] Now it's completely irrelevant because the price, the MSRP is just meaningless.
[2898.90 → 2899.04] Yeah.
[2899.12 → 2900.94] Or it's not irrelevant information.
[2901.54 → 2905.72] It's irrelevant for us to create that graph based on...
[2905.72 → 2906.66] Numbers that aren't real.
[2906.82 → 2908.00] Numbers that are just inventive.
[2908.00 → 2909.92] You're not going to be paying that price to buy the card.
[2909.98 → 2910.12] Yep.
[2910.12 → 2911.32] So it doesn't matter.
[2912.06 → 2915.58] So we're like, okay, we can get MSRP on the site, but like, does that really solve
[2915.58 → 2915.82] anything?
[2915.82 → 2916.32] Yeah.
[2916.32 → 2918.74] So we're working on...
[2918.74 → 2922.56] We have one of them right now, a store where they're sending us their information so we
[2922.56 → 2923.28] can see if it's in stock.
[2923.36 → 2924.52] We can see the price, stuff like that.
[2924.64 → 2924.78] Okay.
[2924.78 → 2926.18] It's not on the site yet, but we...
[2926.18 → 2926.38] Okay.
[2926.48 → 2927.74] But we have like API access.
[2928.16 → 2929.80] Today, we got that from one of them.
[2929.98 → 2930.22] Okay.
[2930.22 → 2931.42] Um, and there's...
[2931.42 → 2933.34] Does everyone have that or like...
[2933.34 → 2936.28] Seems like most stores do, but not all of them.
[2936.38 → 2940.62] And is that something that we have to like pay to access or like what's the deal?
[2940.74 → 2942.48] Seems like sometimes yes.
[2942.66 → 2945.64] Or is there like a rate that's free and then over a certain amount?
[2945.86 → 2949.98] We're going to try to talk to people because I suspect when we talk to people, it's going
[2949.98 → 2950.58] to be free.
[2950.58 → 2957.12] Um, but I think by default, most places that want that type of information are not like
[2957.12 → 2958.00] public info sites.
[2958.20 → 2958.60] Right.
[2958.74 → 2959.00] Okay.
[2959.08 → 2960.10] They're something else.
[2960.58 → 2960.82] Okay.
[2960.90 → 2963.04] Um, so anyway, we'll figure it out.
[2963.10 → 2964.72] But so far it's, it's been fine.
[2964.74 → 2965.20] It's been free.
[2965.58 → 2968.48] Um, but something we're wondering about is like, okay, cool.
[2968.48 → 2973.02] So we can have some store information, but then it's going to be practically impossible.
[2973.02 → 2974.14] Like we have a global audience.
[2974.26 → 2978.84] It's going to be practically impossible to include store information from every single
[2978.84 → 2980.02] store in the world.
[2980.50 → 2984.92] Um, so if we want to be able to build a price performance graph, which I would love to do,
[2985.56 → 2988.60] like, do we do like a Brine your own price setup?
[2988.88 → 2989.74] Oh, interesting.
[2989.90 → 2993.44] Where like you could plug in because one thing that I like about that, and I'm wondering
[2993.44 → 2999.98] what you think about this is you could do that for old cards too, then, because you
[2999.98 → 3006.98] could put in the used market price, and then you could compare like a used market price 3090.
[3007.32 → 3007.72] Yeah.
[3007.94 → 3011.98] Based on your local market, like a listing that you found, you could just plug that number
[3011.98 → 3012.04] in.
[3012.04 → 3012.96] On Facebook marketplace in Italy.
[3012.96 → 3018.20] And then you could compare that against maybe an MSRP card that is out right now and check
[3018.20 → 3020.36] the price performance based on those numbers.
[3021.00 → 3022.40] Like, is that, is that interesting?
[3022.40 → 3028.60] Would you, if you think back to, uh, I don't know, like NCI era, prefix era Linus, would
[3028.60 → 3029.16] you use that?
[3029.18 → 3029.76] I would use it so hard.
[3029.88 → 3031.76] If that's true, should we go that?
[3031.76 → 3032.82] I'd use it super hard.
[3033.02 → 3034.98] Um, I think we should.
[3035.10 → 3036.44] It seems cool to me, but it takes development time, right?
[3036.46 → 3038.52] So yeah, we have to balance against like, what else could we do?
[3038.56 → 3040.54] I think we'd probably have to have both.
[3040.62 → 3045.22] I think you'd have to have a default because realistically something like, depending on whether
[3045.22 → 3051.10] we're talking creator warehouse or LTT, uh, the U S market is somewhere between 40 and
[3051.10 → 3053.84] 65% of our, of our base.
[3054.04 → 3054.32] Right.
[3054.84 → 3060.58] So like U S is, you probably just default to USD because it kind of works for any market
[3060.58 → 3063.42] that derives pricing from USD MSRP as well.
[3063.42 → 3071.50] Like Canada, um, like Canadian pricing for consumer electronics is almost without, without
[3071.50 → 3075.28] exception, just U S pricing times the exchange rate.
[3075.56 → 3078.76] Um, there are, there are industries that don't operate that way.
[3078.84 → 3083.42] Mobile phones, for instance, will have their own Canadian MSRP sometimes game consoles, but
[3083.42 → 3087.74] when it comes to the IT industry, almost all of it is purchased in U S dollars.
[3088.44 → 3092.74] So it's just marked up from whatever the cost is in U S dollars.
[3092.86 → 3095.86] That's just how it works because almost all of it is imported through LA.
[3095.86 → 3105.28] Um, uh, McBain asks tariffs, but tariffs are, are a completely separate conversation from
[3105.28 → 3105.54] that.
[3105.62 → 3109.50] Cause, um, aren't tariffs usually slapped on in cart?
[3109.72 → 3114.62] Well, the Canada doesn't have any tariffs on electronics that are imported from China
[3114.62 → 3115.46] through the U S.
[3115.56 → 3115.90] Yeah.
[3116.06 → 3117.42] So it wouldn't, it wouldn't matter.
[3117.42 → 3121.48] So basically for the U S and Canada, you would just have to convert to your own currency
[3121.48 → 3124.38] to get an approximate idea of what the price to performance would be.
[3124.38 → 3129.08] Um, for some, for stuff like Europe, man, it gets really complicated though, because like
[3129.08 → 3133.02] they do include their taxes and their pricing and like over here we don't.
[3133.26 → 3135.36] And okay.
[3135.74 → 3143.82] Would the idea be potentially to try to have like at least one store partner for like, you
[3143.82 → 3145.18] know, a few currencies.
[3145.54 → 3147.66] I want to have ideally like a bunch of them.
[3147.74 → 3148.26] Oh, okay.
[3148.40 → 3148.64] Okay.
[3148.88 → 3154.36] So this is not an or we are definitely going to have, cause like, I mean, I'm going to
[3154.36 → 3155.36] have a bunch of them.
[3155.36 → 3159.84] I mean, the labs' website is like fairly likely to lose money forever, but, um, we do want
[3159.84 → 3161.40] to have affiliate links for people.
[3161.40 → 3164.52] So those would have to have store prices effectively.
[3164.74 → 3164.96] Yeah.
[3165.10 → 3166.56] Um, Oh yeah, for sure.
[3166.96 → 3170.78] Well, no, they, they wouldn't have to, we have them, we have them already, and we don't
[3170.78 → 3171.44] have store prices.
[3171.56 → 3172.30] It'd be way better.
[3172.52 → 3173.20] It would be better.
[3173.28 → 3173.84] It'd be way better.
[3173.96 → 3175.90] So like it's in the retailers' thing.
[3175.90 → 3180.26] Anyway, it's in a retailer's best interest for us to have a functioning affiliate link.
[3180.42 → 3180.58] Yeah.
[3180.66 → 3182.94] And for us to have functioning stock and pricing.
[3183.16 → 3183.40] Yeah.
[3183.68 → 3185.34] Because effectively they win.
[3185.40 → 3188.60] So we can already have functioning affiliate links, but people are clicking on them blind
[3188.60 → 3189.12] basically.
[3189.30 → 3189.50] Right.
[3189.54 → 3190.46] Which is like stupid.
[3190.54 → 3191.22] It's not ideal.
[3191.50 → 3194.16] So, so that's, that's probably happening anyway.
[3194.38 → 3195.66] Uh, you can't rely on scraping though.
[3195.68 → 3196.54] We're not planning on scraping.
[3196.90 → 3197.86] Um, yes.
[3199.54 → 3199.94] Yeah.
[3199.94 → 3201.18] We will never scrape anything.
[3201.18 → 3203.62] We are good boys.
[3205.62 → 3207.40] We definitely didn't already do that.
[3207.68 → 3210.80] Uh, no, no, we wouldn't.
[3211.06 → 3211.32] Yes.
[3211.56 → 3212.22] We would not.
[3212.36 → 3212.58] Yeah.
[3212.92 → 3214.68] Um, not ever.
[3214.96 → 3218.80] And like some people are pushing back on like, well, what does the MSRP even mean though?
[3219.00 → 3220.26] Because you can't buy a card at MSRP.
[3220.40 → 3223.18] That might be like true, but that's true right now.
[3223.44 → 3226.42] Um, and that's also not true for a lot of other verticals.
[3226.46 → 3228.98] It's mostly just a problem for GPUs.
[3229.14 → 3229.54] Yeah.
[3229.54 → 3231.32] I mean, you can buy a CPU for MSRP right now.
[3231.34 → 3235.30] So we're, we're making a site for more than just GPUs.
[3235.36 → 3241.82] Um, Shrank asks what about a calculator for price to performance where you can put your
[3241.82 → 3242.76] local pricing?
[3244.06 → 3244.46] Yes.
[3244.66 → 3246.38] You're all caught up with the conversation.
[3246.78 → 3247.40] What a great idea.
[3247.42 → 3248.34] That we're in the middle of.
[3248.52 → 3249.44] I love that.
[3249.60 → 3250.60] That's fantastic.
[3251.08 → 3255.70] I think this was, I think this was like Liam's idea or something on the, on the labs web team,
[3255.78 → 3257.30] but I think it's pretty sweet.
[3257.30 → 3262.62] There's, there's been a few others like interesting ideas on how we can deal with like pricing stuff
[3262.62 → 3263.26] on the site.
[3263.56 → 3268.28] Uh, because we're trying to, uh, yeah, make it useful, make it good.
[3268.46 → 3271.02] Angry Panda asks why would you not scrape?
[3271.02 → 3277.38] Well, it's against the terms of service to use the data on people's sites in ways that
[3277.38 → 3278.18] they don't authorize.
[3278.52 → 3280.54] Not technically all of them, but yeah, some of them though.
[3280.78 → 3281.52] Most I'd say.
[3281.66 → 3288.36] Um, and you know, it's just, it puts additional load on their server for non-human traffic
[3288.36 → 3291.54] that is in violation of their terms of service.
[3291.54 → 3297.84] So if for no other reason other than that, it's rude, we would never do it.
[3298.34 → 3298.78] Yeah.
[3301.02 → 3304.94] Full blend's a different company.
[3307.12 → 3307.56] Yeah.
[3307.78 → 3309.54] Linus Media Group would never do it.
[3313.80 → 3314.24] Sorry.
[3314.64 → 3315.50] Something in there.
[3315.62 → 3316.26] Um, okay.
[3316.62 → 3317.06] Anyway.
[3317.70 → 3319.10] Yeah, no, that sounds super cool.
[3319.16 → 3321.52] I would just, I would want it populated with something by default.
[3321.52 → 3323.56] And then I'd want to have like an override.
[3323.80 → 3324.16] Okay.
[3324.74 → 3325.64] Riddle me this.
[3326.16 → 3327.20] Not sure how it would look.
[3327.38 → 3327.96] Could we.
[3328.18 → 3328.76] That's one of the things we're working on.
[3328.76 → 3337.30] Could we implement like, like a high, low, high, low median of eBay sales prices?
[3337.94 → 3342.96] Because that would, I mean, that would tell us what is readily available secondhand.
[3342.96 → 3344.50] We're still learning how to do a lot of this stuff.
[3344.50 → 3347.00] Like I'm talking about, oh, we got like a pricing thing today.
[3347.00 → 3352.50] It's super far from landing on the site because we're probably not going to want to land it on the site with only one partner.
[3352.60 → 3356.36] So we're probably still waiting to go through like communication negotiations with other partners.
[3356.36 → 3358.88] We also have to figure out like how we're going to lay this stuff out.
[3358.96 → 3366.74] Like if we show multiple stores for the price performance thing, which might be a thing that we do.
[3366.74 → 3368.98] And we also make it so you can bring your own price.
[3369.10 → 3373.06] And then we also make it so you have high, low, medium for eBay.
[3373.18 → 3375.08] But then eBay is very like location specific.
[3375.12 → 3378.68] This is starting to become the kind of thing that I'd want to like save my session for.
[3379.08 → 3379.10] Yeah.
[3379.10 → 3384.04] Like it starts getting like really like we're scope creeping, feature creeping the heck out of it.
[3384.08 → 3386.28] So it's like that might be cool.
[3386.36 → 3389.72] But then we're already like, again, we've never done this stuff before.
[3389.78 → 3390.30] This is new to us.
[3390.32 → 3390.76] How about this?
[3390.78 → 3393.18] We're looking at all this data from even these stores.
[3393.18 → 3397.30] And even the stores are really weird about how they list and label things sometimes.
[3397.54 → 3397.66] Oh, yeah.
[3397.70 → 3400.82] Because marketplace and like so you'll have something that's a better price.
[3401.12 → 3402.94] But the shipping is like $45.
[3403.92 → 3410.42] It's like we were when we were looking at Amazon at one point, I found a SSD listed under graphics cards.
[3410.42 → 3417.86] With like the specs like smashed into each other sort of like some of them were GPU specs.
[3417.94 → 3420.62] Some of them were like you pull some really weird data out of there.
[3420.70 → 3425.84] So we have to try to figure out like how to match this up with reviews on our site and all these other things.
[3425.84 → 3427.16] And like there's that.
[3427.16 → 3429.60] I think it's more complicated when you go somewhere like eBay.
[3429.78 → 3433.30] I would love to think that you could kind of crowdsource something like that.
[3433.30 → 3437.94] Like the like valid links to the right part number.
[3438.08 → 3440.70] But then sometimes those things can change.
[3441.02 → 3442.66] Companies can rev stuff silently.
[3442.66 → 3445.76] And so all of a sudden that information becomes out of date.
[3445.76 → 3449.28] Not because anyone in the community did anything wrong or because our site did anything wrong.
[3449.28 → 3453.58] But because there was just there was a silent revision and nobody knows.
[3455.62 → 3456.46] Yeah, it's interesting.
[3456.60 → 3458.72] There 's's a lot of different ways we can approach it.
[3459.08 → 3459.88] But I think.
[3460.94 → 3461.86] I think this will be.
[3462.08 → 3465.72] I think I would in my perfect world, I would select my country.
[3466.50 → 3469.72] And then I would say I want to buy new.
[3469.72 → 3472.70] Even that like just started to cut you off.
[3472.78 → 3474.92] Just even that allowing country selection.
[3475.10 → 3478.28] We're now either excluding a ton of people.
[3479.20 → 3483.80] Or we're scaling to an incredible number of stores to support right off the bat.
[3483.98 → 3486.84] Well, we would start with one or two countries.
[3487.52 → 3487.70] Yeah.
[3487.76 → 3488.82] And then we would add as needed.
[3488.96 → 3491.62] But it's just in terms of like how I configure my view.
[3491.90 → 3494.86] I'd want to select my country because otherwise what are we even doing here?
[3495.48 → 3495.76] Right.
[3495.92 → 3497.48] And the US would probably be the default.
[3497.98 → 3498.36] Sure.
[3498.36 → 3499.88] So I'd want to select my country.
[3500.02 → 3501.56] So you have that like scrollable list of countries with the US.
[3502.24 → 3504.48] Like you normally have with like keyboards and languages.
[3504.48 → 3504.76] Exactly.
[3504.98 → 3507.12] And then I'd probably want to go new.
[3508.80 → 3509.20] Used.
[3510.32 → 3511.20] And then custom.
[3511.20 → 3512.56] Are these like checkboxes or?
[3512.66 → 3513.88] No, this would be like a mode.
[3514.18 → 3514.46] Okay.
[3514.64 → 3515.84] New, used and custom.
[3516.20 → 3518.08] So custom is brought your own price.
[3518.28 → 3518.42] Yeah.
[3518.50 → 3520.70] Used is like eBay, Craigslist, whatever else.
[3520.92 → 3521.14] Yeah.
[3521.20 → 3522.50] And then new is just MSRP.
[3523.04 → 3523.60] Ah, no.
[3523.76 → 3523.94] No.
[3524.00 → 3525.38] New is store pricing.
[3525.44 → 3526.06] Store pricing.
[3526.22 → 3526.38] Yeah.
[3526.38 → 3530.84] Would you have an MSRP option just to like chip away at graphics cards?
[3531.18 → 3531.50] No.
[3531.62 → 3532.92] Just to make fun of graphics cards?
[3533.20 → 3533.34] Yeah.
[3533.42 → 3533.76] Probably not.
[3533.76 → 3533.78] Yeah.
[3533.78 → 3534.84] It's just like, it's just useless.
[3534.84 → 3535.74] What can you buy it for now?
[3535.90 → 3536.12] Yeah.
[3536.58 → 3536.98] Exactly.
[3537.14 → 3541.80] Would you show like what if, what if something is completely out of stock practically everywhere?
[3541.80 → 3545.12] Would we have like a warning?
[3546.12 → 3548.12] I mean, almost nothing.
[3548.68 → 3549.56] Tell me something.
[3550.36 → 3551.02] Tell me something.
[3551.68 → 3552.32] 50-90.
[3552.44 → 3552.94] 50-90.
[3553.06 → 3554.24] I'll find it in stock right now.
[3554.34 → 3555.28] I haven't checked at all.
[3555.38 → 3555.94] I have no idea.
[3558.88 → 3561.24] But I mean, there will be a scenario where there are none.
[3561.78 → 3562.06] Okay.
[3562.06 → 3565.84] So if you have $5,000, you can buy a 50-90 right now.
[3566.08 → 3567.52] But you said new, right?
[3567.70 → 3568.14] That's new.
[3568.40 → 3569.36] But this is on eBay.
[3569.62 → 3569.86] So?
[3569.96 → 3571.38] So does new include eBay?
[3571.88 → 3575.84] Because people aren't always truthful about new things on eBay.
[3576.58 → 3578.48] Sometimes people sell pictures of things.
[3578.52 → 3579.66] I'm just saying.
[3579.80 → 3581.14] There's always a price.
[3581.14 → 3585.20] So what we could do is we could return our best result.
[3585.62 → 3586.60] Our closest match.
[3587.32 → 3589.80] Like I'm willing to bet if I go on.
[3590.06 → 3590.58] Okay.
[3590.64 → 3590.80] Here.
[3591.22 → 3592.74] Let's try Amazon.com.
[3593.10 → 3594.88] I bet there's like a third party seller.
[3596.28 → 3599.54] That has a 50-90 for like $6,000 or whatever.
[3605.44 → 3606.18] Here we go.
[3606.28 → 3606.78] Add to cart.
[3606.88 → 3607.28] One left.
[3607.44 → 3608.08] $4,000.
[3608.34 → 3608.84] 50-90.
[3608.84 → 3609.12] Boom.
[3609.12 → 3612.18] I'm not saying you should buy it.
[3612.54 → 3614.54] I'm just saying you can.
[3614.86 → 3616.34] That's such a yikes, dude.
[3616.46 → 3616.78] I know.
[3616.80 → 3617.80] Was that American Amazon?
[3618.18 → 3618.52] Oh, yeah.
[3619.04 → 3620.20] You better believe it, buddy.
[3620.28 → 3622.02] That is like, wow.
[3622.12 → 3623.78] What does that actually work out to?
[3623.84 → 3626.64] So an additional $450 per $1,000.
[3627.18 → 3630.92] So that is like a $6,000 Canadian GPU.
[3631.92 → 3638.92] That is going to cost like over 10% of the median Canadian income for a GPU.
[3639.12 → 3640.38] If I recall correctly.
[3640.38 → 3641.08] That's so absurd.
[3641.34 → 3643.76] Median Canadian income.
[3645.98 → 3647.96] A little under 10%.
[3647.96 → 3649.50] Wild.
[3651.18 → 3651.66] Wild.
[3653.74 → 3654.18] Anyway.
[3654.84 → 3656.12] What are we supposed to be doing right now, Dan?
[3658.80 → 3660.68] We do need to kind of turbo thrive.
[3661.10 → 3661.86] I think we're...
[3661.86 → 3662.06] Oh, wait.
[3662.14 → 3663.56] We never finished that topic.
[3664.00 → 3664.94] What was it even?
[3665.04 → 3665.74] Oh, yeah.
[3665.82 → 3666.14] Oh, yeah.
[3666.14 → 3667.30] No, there's not much more to say there.
[3667.86 → 3668.12] Okay.
[3669.38 → 3669.78] Yep.
[3670.22 → 3670.46] Cool.
[3670.68 → 3672.56] I think five topics was fine.
[3673.14 → 3673.70] Yeah, maybe.
[3676.24 → 3680.60] Let's cap off our week with end caps.
[3680.80 → 3681.16] Oh.
[3681.60 → 3682.64] That's right, folks.
[3683.40 → 3683.88] Dang it.
[3683.90 → 3684.94] I always get this wrong.
[3684.94 → 3700.32] From now until Monday, when you add both a precision screwdriver bundle and a precision end cap set to your cart, we are going to give you the end cap set for free.
[3700.32 → 3707.32] And if you don't know what we're talking about, we have designed the end caps of our precision screwdriver to be interchangeable.
[3708.06 → 3708.68] That's right.
[3708.98 → 3711.92] You can just put a little thing here.
[3712.78 → 3714.16] Yeah, I think I got it.
[3714.82 → 3716.14] It's easier if you have a wrench.
[3716.52 → 3722.36] The point is, you just hold this spot right here, and you can screw off the end cap.
[3722.36 → 3729.56] So then you just got the little bearing piece right there and then replace it with one of our other end caps.
[3729.72 → 3734.76] We have also flat topped black one.
[3735.20 → 3735.40] Okay.
[3735.80 → 3736.28] Oh, wait.
[3736.62 → 3737.30] What's going on here?
[3737.42 → 3739.22] Would you call that colour copper?
[3739.40 → 3739.74] Not really.
[3739.84 → 3740.14] I don't know.
[3740.14 → 3740.58] Maybe orange.
[3740.96 → 3741.06] Orange?
[3741.06 → 3744.92] And then we also have a concave one and a convex one.
[3745.06 → 3750.76] So if you're the kind of person who prefers to, you know, put your finger like this, you might prefer the concave.
[3751.00 → 3755.38] If you're the kind of person who wants to kind of palm it, then you might prefer the convex.
[3756.22 → 3757.86] I think, what's the default?
[3757.98 → 3758.80] Is the default flat?
[3758.92 → 3759.26] I can't remember.
[3759.26 → 3760.16] I'm checking right now.
[3760.34 → 3760.74] Oh, man.
[3760.84 → 3762.94] Well, they've like changed all of these, I think.
[3763.24 → 3764.72] Yeah, but I'm checking the store listing.
[3765.00 → 3766.68] I think the default is flat orange.
[3766.68 → 3772.54] Yeah, the default is flat orange, and then it also comes with a matte black flat top one.
[3773.12 → 3775.98] So anyway, you get an end cap set for free.
[3777.38 → 3779.76] So not only do you get a, oh, wait, you get it.
[3779.84 → 3780.10] Oh, yeah.
[3780.16 → 3786.52] So not only do you get a $10 discount by purchasing both a Precision Driver and a BITNET, so that's for the combo,
[3786.82 → 3791.46] you also get another $10 value with the end cap set.
[3791.58 → 3793.20] That's $20 of value.
[3793.20 → 3798.18] The deal is available now until Monday, 10 a.m. Pacific time, and it will automatically apply
[3798.18 → 3802.08] if you add the Precision Screwdriver bundle and end cap set to your cart.
[3802.38 → 3804.14] There are also some updates here.
[3804.38 → 3805.46] Quick float plane update.
[3805.98 → 3808.08] Dan, do you want to bring that video up?
[3808.52 → 3816.38] Dan and Smash Champs general manager Jim Peng did a little tour of the currently soft launched Smash Champs.
[3816.56 → 3819.32] It is now up as a float plane exclusive.
[3819.32 → 3825.16] Dan may have struggled a little bit with the word, well, the name, Sisyphus.
[3825.84 → 3828.36] But other than that, absolute banger.
[3829.00 → 3829.68] There you go.
[3830.78 → 3836.82] You can watch from 7.55 and stop after Sammy says, one must imagine Dan happy.
[3837.30 → 3838.14] Do we have audio?
[3838.22 → 3839.08] Whatever that means.
[3839.08 → 3841.16] Other things that people do at a gym?
[3841.64 → 3844.50] Look, Sammy, I'm syphilis or whatever that guy's name is.
[3844.50 → 3845.06] Syphilis.
[3845.54 → 3847.30] One must imagine Dan happy.
[3847.70 → 3849.18] We have a towel service now?
[3850.14 → 3851.06] Oh, okay.
[3851.18 → 3851.96] My goodness.
[3852.38 → 3856.56] You can watch the rest of it at leg.GG slash float plane.
[3857.20 → 3862.98] In other float plane goodness news, Sarah whipped up a new design live on stream this week.
[3863.76 → 3867.98] With suggestions from the chat, they've created Derby Dino's Volume 1.
[3868.14 → 3871.88] And yes, it is exactly as adorable and silly as it sounds.
[3872.56 → 3873.56] What am I looking at here?
[3874.84 → 3875.72] Did we get to see it?
[3875.74 → 3876.52] Wait, is this it?
[3876.92 → 3877.06] Oh.
[3877.06 → 3877.48] Did we get to see it?
[3877.50 → 3878.92] Streams with Sarah Art print 3.
[3879.30 → 3880.28] Streams with Sarah T-shirt 3.
[3880.28 → 3883.14] Oh, there's a drive folder link that I don't have access to.
[3883.38 → 3883.78] Nice.
[3884.38 → 3884.84] Oh, boy.
[3884.84 → 3886.36] I bet I don't have access to it either.
[3887.38 → 3888.44] I do not have access.
[3888.54 → 3889.24] So cool.
[3889.70 → 3890.22] All right.
[3890.24 → 3890.92] So cool to you.
[3890.92 → 3892.44] I will throw that on.
[3892.50 → 3892.74] Okay.
[3893.06 → 3894.12] Dan's working on it.
[3894.48 → 3898.58] Sarah's still doing some last minute touches like shading, but the outline is final and
[3898.58 → 3901.76] you can expect to see that by the end of March 31st.
[3902.50 → 3905.36] Also, if you remember the Content Cosmos.
[3905.52 → 3907.34] Oh, that is super cute.
[3908.16 → 3908.90] They're not Derby.
[3909.06 → 3911.10] They're exactly the way God made them.
[3912.74 → 3913.18] Derby.
[3913.54 → 3914.12] That's fantastic.
[3914.12 → 3916.28] Do they all feature bread or is it?
[3916.84 → 3920.58] I think that's a Cupcake-assures over on the left there.
[3920.82 → 3921.30] Oh, okay.
[3921.54 → 3923.32] And Baguette-a-dactyl at the top.
[3923.50 → 3923.74] Yep.
[3923.82 → 3924.46] I got that.
[3925.06 → 3926.38] There's a flow plane in the back, right?
[3926.86 → 3928.12] There's a...
[3929.24 → 3934.56] I don't actually see any bread on the weird bird velociraptor thing.
[3934.56 → 3936.04] Is there like gingerbread men?
[3937.32 → 3937.72] Okay.
[3938.08 → 3938.22] Yeah.
[3938.22 → 3938.48] Where?
[3938.58 → 3939.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3939.60 → 3939.86] Where?
[3939.86 → 3940.26] Where?
[3940.50 → 3941.84] Just above the rock on the right.
[3942.72 → 3943.16] Oh, yeah.
[3943.22 → 3943.46] Okay.
[3943.52 → 3944.36] Oh, no, I see those.
[3944.44 → 3946.74] I'm just wondering about the bird raptor there.
[3946.74 → 3948.06] Yeah, the very bottom middle one.
[3948.20 → 3948.56] Unsure.
[3948.66 → 3952.76] Also, is that little chicken and the egg in the bottom left like growing out of a loaf?
[3952.76 → 3955.96] Oh, I don't know.
[3956.10 → 3956.38] Maybe.
[3957.64 → 3958.04] Unsure.
[3958.16 → 3959.16] The missing link.
[3959.48 → 3960.48] Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[3960.58 → 3961.40] That's how that works.
[3962.42 → 3967.10] Also, if you remember the Content Cosmos design she did in December, the one with the very
[3967.10 → 3974.20] legally distinct Pyrokitsune, that one's been remastered to take better advantage of colour usage
[3974.20 → 3976.34] for a poster.
[3977.48 → 3978.42] Oh, my goodness.
[3978.56 → 3980.30] This looks flipping awesome.
[3980.58 → 3981.26] What size is that?
[3981.26 → 3983.98] That is so cool.
[3984.16 → 3986.12] And oh, my goodness.
[3986.22 → 3987.02] There's a shirt.
[3987.92 → 3989.40] There's a colour shirt.
[3990.48 → 3991.42] Oh, dude.
[3992.16 → 3993.52] Dude, that's fire.
[3993.76 → 3995.92] That is like actual fire.
[3996.20 → 3997.00] It's super cool.
[3997.28 → 3998.12] Super cool design.
[3998.20 → 4003.82] Anyway, both the Derby Dino's shirt slash poster and the Content Cosmos poster are available
[4003.82 → 4008.32] until April 14th at LMG.GG slash streams with Sarah.
[4008.32 → 4011.32] That shirt isn't available, though.
[4011.40 → 4012.28] Just to sweeten the deal.
[4012.28 → 4016.74] The very first print of the poster is signed by Sarah, Dan, and Sammy.
[4017.28 → 4021.02] And one random buyer is going to get it included with their order.
[4021.14 → 4022.54] It's marked one of one on the back.
[4022.88 → 4024.22] Also, yes, by the way.
[4024.88 → 4027.10] Derby Dino's will get a remaster, too.
[4027.10 → 4028.68] It's just taking a bit.
[4029.26 → 4029.88] Art takes time.
[4029.98 → 4032.76] It actually has a value because it actually does take time.
[4033.72 → 4035.80] That's how these things work.
[4036.68 → 4037.04] Well, what?
[4037.10 → 4038.62] No, people think art should be free.
[4038.94 → 4039.48] Do they?
[4039.54 → 4039.88] It's not.
[4039.98 → 4040.40] Yes.
[4040.62 → 4040.98] Okay.
[4041.76 → 4042.24] Dude.
[4042.72 → 4043.08] Okay.
[4043.42 → 4043.82] Tell you what.
[4043.82 → 4044.00] I don't know.
[4044.18 → 4044.76] Tell you what.
[4045.52 → 4046.00] Hypothetical.
[4046.00 → 4051.60] Let's say someone, maybe, let's say YouTube content creator.
[4051.90 → 4052.24] Okay.
[4052.42 → 4054.82] Released an app where you could buy wallpapers.
[4056.68 → 4058.54] How mad would people be?
[4058.60 → 4059.00] Enraged.
[4059.00 → 4061.06] If they had to pay for wallpaper?
[4061.28 → 4061.84] Peeved.
[4062.84 → 4064.90] Would it be a big scandal?
[4065.06 → 4066.44] There were other problems with it.
[4066.46 → 4067.18] Yeah, there were.
[4069.02 → 4070.02] Just saying.
[4070.02 → 4078.26] However, there was a not zero number of people that were simply outraged at the idea of paying for art.
[4078.30 → 4079.74] What's the current status of that?
[4079.78 → 4080.98] I have no idea.
[4081.08 → 4081.86] What was it called?
[4082.00 → 4082.86] I have no idea.
[4082.88 → 4083.74] Panels or something?
[4083.82 → 4085.00] I have no idea.
[4085.28 → 4089.28] I almost immediately stopped caring about it completely.
[4089.60 → 4089.96] Yeah.
[4090.34 → 4096.10] I have not changed the wallpaper on my phone in as long as I can remember.
[4096.46 → 4098.42] I think I've had my current one for.
[4098.42 → 4102.88] Whatever is the default wallpaper and I give zero cares beyond that.
[4102.96 → 4103.28] I'm sorry.
[4103.40 → 4104.50] I just can't care about it.
[4104.50 → 4104.90] It still exists.
[4105.56 → 4107.60] It currently has a rating of 4.7 stars.
[4107.78 → 4108.40] Hey, there you go.
[4108.88 → 4110.00] How many reviews does it have?
[4110.74 → 4111.70] Almost 10,000.
[4112.70 → 4113.10] Wow.
[4113.22 → 4113.40] Okay.
[4113.48 → 4114.80] Well, then apparently it's doing great.
[4115.38 → 4115.96] Go panels.
[4116.28 → 4116.92] That's what it's called, right?
[4117.44 → 4117.76] Yeah.
[4117.92 → 4118.20] Panels.
[4118.32 → 4118.66] There you go.
[4118.76 → 4119.12] Panels.
[4120.26 → 4120.74] Way to go.
[4124.32 → 4125.86] And do you want a couple of merch messages?
[4126.20 → 4126.62] Oh, right.
[4126.70 → 4126.88] Yes.
[4126.88 → 4127.52] Merch messages.
[4127.52 → 4131.30] So if you buy any merch, the best something.
[4131.50 → 4131.86] No, wait.
[4132.14 → 4138.14] If you want to interact with the show, we don't do Twitch bits or super chats or anything like
[4138.14 → 4138.44] that.
[4138.56 → 4142.54] The way we see it, if you're going to throw money at your screen, you should get something
[4142.54 → 4143.12] in return.
[4143.30 → 4144.70] So we do merch messages.
[4144.70 → 4149.76] So all you got to do is head over to LTTstore.com and find something you like, whether it's
[4149.76 → 4153.12] the precision screwdriver bundle that we were talking about earlier, where you can get a
[4153.12 → 4158.68] free end cap set, or whether it's just one of our recent products like the reversible
[4158.68 → 4159.84] bomber jacket.
[4160.20 → 4164.64] Would you believe that this jacket and this jacket are the same jacket?
[4164.64 → 4165.04] What?
[4165.36 → 4165.64] What?
[4165.86 → 4167.04] Just one's inside out?
[4167.90 → 4168.82] Which one's inside out?
[4168.94 → 4169.86] Oh, oh, ooh.
[4170.18 → 4171.00] Ooh, here's a debate.
[4171.64 → 4171.94] Dan.
[4172.32 → 4172.62] Yeah.
[4172.76 → 4174.30] Which one of them is inside out?
[4177.08 → 4178.16] I think I know.
[4178.46 → 4180.10] Depends on where the seams are.
[4180.12 → 4180.94] Which one's inside out?
[4180.96 → 4181.46] I think there's an answer.
[4181.46 → 4181.68] Well, here.
[4181.78 → 4182.12] Hold on.
[4182.18 → 4182.60] I've got one.
[4182.62 → 4183.82] I think the orange one's inside out.
[4183.82 → 4185.56] I was wearing mine today.
[4185.68 → 4186.54] I was wearing mine today.
[4186.82 → 4187.74] So I have it.
[4188.64 → 4189.96] I think there's an answer.
[4190.44 → 4190.80] Okay.
[4192.90 → 4195.96] Which one, which one is inside out?
[4197.14 → 4205.44] I think the orange is technically the inside because that's where the label is.
[4205.82 → 4206.06] Yeah.
[4206.18 → 4208.06] Because you haven't ripped it out yet, so you can still tell.
[4208.88 → 4209.32] Okay.
[4209.56 → 4210.92] Now which one's inside out?
[4211.38 → 4211.82] Boom.
[4212.08 → 4212.34] Boom.
[4212.34 → 4212.60] Boom.
[4212.60 → 4216.46] I think it's still the orange because the knowledge of the label originally being.
[4216.46 → 4217.06] I have object permanence.
[4217.12 → 4217.36] Yeah.
[4217.70 → 4218.04] Yeah.
[4218.68 → 4219.38] I think the.
[4219.62 → 4220.84] We are evolved animals.
[4220.84 → 4221.40] The correct.
[4221.40 → 4225.98] The correct hack would be which side has the zipper the right way.
[4226.06 → 4226.64] Uh-uh-uh.
[4226.76 → 4229.60] Except that our garments are just random.
[4229.74 → 4230.00] Yep.
[4232.88 → 4234.30] So that doesn't quite count.
[4234.30 → 4240.64] So the reason for that is that it's different in Commonwealth and American countries.
[4240.64 → 4244.74] And in Canada, we're, we're fucked, man.
[4244.74 → 4250.26] We just, we have no idea what's going on in terms of like Imperial and metric and like
[4250.26 → 4252.06] colour with a U.
[4252.18 → 4252.82] Why not both?
[4252.88 → 4253.86] Colour without a U.
[4253.86 → 4256.30] Aren't we pretty solidly on colour with a U?
[4256.50 → 4259.14] I regularly see Canadians spell it without a U.
[4259.44 → 4259.72] Uh.
[4260.50 → 4260.90] Regularly.
[4260.98 → 4261.38] Fair enough.
[4261.54 → 4265.04] And like most of our spell check is going to default to American English.
[4265.72 → 4266.52] So it will have.
[4266.52 → 4267.46] I correct it all the time.
[4267.58 → 4268.74] No colour, no neighbour.
[4269.02 → 4272.10] I'm like a little, I care too much about that.
[4272.20 → 4273.52] And I suspect most people don't.
[4273.72 → 4273.88] Yeah.
[4273.88 → 4274.46] So that makes sense.
[4274.64 → 4274.86] Yep.
[4274.96 → 4275.54] I get it.
[4275.58 → 4276.10] I get it.
[4276.10 → 4280.14] Um, so anyway, that wouldn't work for that.
[4280.50 → 4282.10] The answer is that there is no answer.
[4282.16 → 4286.92] The point is all you got to do to send a merch message to interact with the show is pick
[4286.92 → 4288.94] something up on LTT store.com.
[4289.02 → 4294.84] Like say, for example, our terminally online hoodie, get it book.
[4294.92 → 4299.64] And then you will get in your cart, a little box for a merchant message.
[4299.68 → 4300.14] Look at that.
[4300.20 → 4300.72] We are live.
[4300.82 → 4302.68] I would like my purchase to appear as a merch message.
[4302.68 → 4306.90] Uh, so you can go ahead and send a little message, and it will go to producer Dan.
[4307.08 → 4307.32] Ooh.
[4307.56 → 4308.46] That's what they sound like.
[4308.54 → 4308.92] It will go.
[4308.98 → 4309.08] Yeah.
[4309.10 → 4309.72] That's what they sound like.
[4309.78 → 4310.46] That's what they all sound like.
[4310.94 → 4315.98] It will go to producer Dan who will throw it down there or respond to it himself or
[4315.98 → 4319.02] curate it for me and Luke to respond to.
[4319.18 → 4322.08] So Dan's going to show you guys how the curated ones work.
[4322.18 → 4322.42] Sure.
[4322.54 → 4323.80] Got me here from Drew.
[4324.04 → 4324.66] Hey, DLL.
[4324.94 → 4329.66] Do any of you or anyone at LMG have plans to attend NAB this year?
[4329.66 → 4333.32] I've been wanting to go since 2019, but I finally managed to pull together the money
[4333.32 → 4334.06] to go this year.
[4334.62 → 4337.06] Um, I think we are.
[4337.36 → 4338.16] I suspect somebody will be.
[4338.16 → 4339.94] Sending a contingent NAB.
[4339.94 → 4340.72] Like one or two at the very least.
[4340.72 → 4342.00] We don't really cover the show.
[4342.12 → 4347.96] We've done it a couple of times, but the truth is it just plain doesn't perform on our
[4347.96 → 4348.26] channel.
[4348.76 → 4356.14] Um, the overlap between camera geeks and tech geeks is there, but they, I don't know, they
[4356.14 → 4360.96] kind of, they kind of float in different orbits, and we just don't find that it performs the
[4360.96 → 4364.48] way that, you know, we would need it to, to justify the cost of attending a show like
[4364.48 → 4364.64] that.
[4364.64 → 4368.82] As you pointed out so well, it's not free to go to NAB.
[4369.34 → 4373.64] Uh, we have had, we have had times when we've attended just to like to see what's coming down
[4373.64 → 4374.32] the pipe, but.
[4374.42 → 4375.40] That sounds like a saying.
[4376.28 → 4376.56] What?
[4376.60 → 4377.98] It's not free to go to NAB.
[4378.68 → 4378.94] Yeah.
[4379.14 → 4381.08] I don't think it's going to catch on.
[4381.20 → 4381.44] No.
[4381.44 → 4386.64] Um, I'm not planning to go, but I always like, you know, reading the news about what
[4386.64 → 4387.38] comes out of there.
[4387.48 → 4388.02] Have you been?
[4388.58 → 4389.62] I've never been to NAB.
[4389.82 → 4390.24] Yeah, me neither.
[4390.46 → 4391.96] Uh, there's often cool stuff.
[4391.96 → 4394.18] Like there was, uh, what's, what's their nuts?
[4394.28 → 4400.46] Uh, I think like ASUS had a modular display there one year, and then I think, yeah, hey,
[4400.46 → 4400.98] what happened to that?
[4401.02 → 4404.90] We were supposed to like to get our hands on it or something and then that just never materialized.
[4404.96 → 4406.42] Maybe that didn't end up being a real product.
[4407.42 → 4408.36] Um, all right.
[4408.36 → 4410.94] Up next.
[4411.48 → 4413.36] Hey, LLLDD.
[4414.14 → 4419.30] Have you thought about doing a WAN-a-then, a 12-hour stream with guests and you all just
[4419.30 → 4420.24] playing video games?
[4420.48 → 4420.76] Wow.
[4420.76 → 4424.22] If I'd personally watch the GOD three times just to add to the views.
[4425.96 → 4429.20] No, I don't think I have ever thought about doing a WAN-a-then.
[4430.28 → 4430.68] Um.
[4430.86 → 4431.56] Don't do that.
[4432.34 → 4435.10] Don't actively sit there and watch WAN show three times.
[4435.64 → 4436.08] Please.
[4437.12 → 4437.84] They can't if they want.
[4437.84 → 4438.32] No.
[4438.58 → 4439.22] It's a free country.
[4439.44 → 4439.64] No.
[4440.26 → 4441.14] Go outside.
[4441.82 → 4443.02] They could do it outside.
[4443.46 → 4443.90] Okay.
[4444.20 → 4446.18] If you're going to do that, fair enough.
[4446.70 → 4447.40] Fair enough.
[4448.36 → 4449.24] My God.
[4450.48 → 4451.20] Oh man.
[4451.46 → 4457.58] Imagine watching 12 hours of WAN show and for two thirds of it having heard everything
[4457.58 → 4458.04] before.
[4458.04 → 4465.90] Man, I feel like the quality would really go down after the natural ending of WAN show.
[4465.90 → 4467.98] Because we don't have a hard end to WAN show.
[4468.06 → 4468.26] No.
[4468.48 → 4474.34] It just ends when we have somewhere to be, or we run out of stuff to talk about that we
[4474.34 → 4475.56] feel is interesting enough.
[4475.56 → 4479.94] Uh, that's why sometimes it ends kind of abruptly where I'm just like, all right, well, see you
[4479.94 → 4480.30] next week.
[4480.64 → 4480.78] Yeah.
[4480.82 → 4484.46] Cause like it, sometimes the near the ending might actually feel like the highlight of
[4484.46 → 4484.74] the show.
[4484.74 → 4486.98] But once we're out of gas, we're like pretty out of gas.
[4486.98 → 4488.36] So it's kind of time to go.
[4488.52 → 4488.64] Yeah.
[4488.68 → 4494.76] And we'd like legitimately have to really make certain people very angry and eat on
[4494.76 → 4495.16] the show.
[4495.38 → 4499.02] If we're going for 12 hours, like there's no way I could survive.
[4499.10 → 4499.92] I'm already hungry.
[4500.42 → 4500.86] Yeah.
[4501.62 → 4504.12] I've been exercising more again lately though.
[4504.14 → 4505.44] So I think that's a big part of why.
[4505.82 → 4509.04] Um, and I've only eaten borscht for the last two days.
[4509.70 → 4515.14] Every once in a while, my aunt does like a giant batch of borscht and brings it over
[4515.14 → 4517.56] to my house with like a giant loaf of sourdough.
[4517.64 → 4519.98] And then I just eat nothing but that for until it's gone.
[4521.20 → 4522.84] Oh dude, I love me some borscht.
[4523.08 → 4523.90] Ukrainian style.
[4525.72 → 4526.54] Ukrainian style.
[4528.14 → 4529.90] I didn't know there was a difference, but.
[4530.60 → 4531.34] Uh, I'm pretty sure.
[4531.42 → 4532.50] I'm pretty sure there's a difference.
[4532.70 → 4533.14] I'm pretty sure.
[4534.44 → 4534.84] Borscht.
[4535.30 → 4535.66] Borscht.
[4536.58 → 4537.56] Someone said batch of what?
[4537.64 → 4538.56] So I just repeated it.
[4538.66 → 4539.00] Borscht.
[4539.52 → 4539.92] Borscht.
[4540.04 → 4540.40] Borscht.
[4540.40 → 4544.54] It's the world's most polarizing soup stew thing.
[4544.72 → 4545.08] Is it?
[4545.76 → 4547.18] People either love it or hate it.
[4547.22 → 4550.00] I don't think I've ever found someone who's kind of tepid on borscht.
[4550.34 → 4550.48] Hmm.
[4551.94 → 4554.18] I mean, feel free to feel free to let me know guys.
[4555.24 → 4555.68] Um.
[4557.50 → 4560.68] Maybe the worst word in existence or at least the ugliest.
[4561.14 → 4561.54] Yuck.
[4562.32 → 4562.80] Um.
[4563.20 → 4564.26] It's the best.
[4564.40 → 4564.98] It's yum.
[4565.30 → 4565.62] Okay.
[4565.76 → 4566.00] Yeah.
[4566.14 → 4566.38] Yeah.
[4566.42 → 4566.86] There you go.
[4567.60 → 4568.04] There you go.
[4570.10 → 4570.70] All right.
[4570.72 → 4571.64] What are we supposed to be talking about?
[4571.64 → 4572.32] Ah, yes.
[4572.42 → 4574.42] It can happen to anyone.
[4574.96 → 4575.26] Yeah.
[4575.96 → 4576.32] Okay.
[4577.00 → 4578.66] You're trying to spin this as a good thing.
[4578.86 → 4578.94] Yes.
[4578.94 → 4584.70] So why don't I get through the topic, and then you can explain your, um, indefensible position.
[4585.00 → 4585.90] You will agree with me.
[4585.90 → 4586.52] Have I...
[4586.52 → 4592.60] Have I been pwned, creator?
[4592.86 → 4597.00] And Microsoft regional director Troy Hunt has been pwned.
[4597.00 → 4618.60] In a blog post earlier this week, Hunt revealed on Tuesday that he had fallen victim to a phishing attack in the form of a fake error email that purported to be from Mailchimp that stole approximately 16,000 records from his Mailchimp mailing list, including the email addresses of both active and lapsed subscribers.
[4618.60 → 4634.52] He realized his mistake almost immediately, but before he could change his password, the automated attack had exported his mailing list and created a new API key, which is it had gone unnoticed, would have given the attacker persistent access to Hunt's Mailchimp account.
[4634.52 → 4645.52] Hunt notes that Mailchimp does not offer a phishing resistant 2FA option and that the attack site simply relayed his one-time password as soon as he entered it.
[4645.52 → 4657.58] Um, JB, Jordan Block, adds, the entire blog post is an interesting read, though many of the concerns he has about Mailchimp's data retention can probably be answered with, because spam laws.
[4659.14 → 4659.70] Okay.
[4659.92 → 4660.58] That makes sense.
[4660.64 → 4661.26] That's interesting.
[4661.70 → 4664.70] Luke's take on this is that it's a good thing.
[4664.80 → 4664.96] Yep.
[4665.80 → 4666.16] Go.
[4666.58 → 4669.74] The phishing, they have I been pwned guy got phished.
[4670.10 → 4674.60] There's always, I mean, you've had multiple experiences with this.
[4674.60 → 4685.26] There's always when, when somebody gets pwned, uh, when somebody gets pwned, there's always the like, oh, but like, he does know that I would have noticed.
[4685.42 → 4685.78] Oh, sure.
[4686.04 → 4686.18] Yeah.
[4686.20 → 4691.20] And it's like, yeah, you know, in this case you might've, but you also don't know the exact scenario that the person was in.
[4691.26 → 4692.10] You don't know.
[4692.66 → 4694.02] Uh, what was he in the middle?
[4694.08 → 4694.68] Was he tired?
[4694.68 → 4697.68] I think it was, I read his blog post, but I read it earlier this week.
[4697.68 → 4698.02] He said something.
[4698.14 → 4704.16] I don't actually remember what it was, but like it, to me, it's like the reason why I don't even remember is that it's not even like super particularly relevant.
[4704.16 → 4705.38] Because everybody's got their thing.
[4705.48 → 4717.66] Like most cases that I know of, and it's not ubiquitous, but most cases that I know of when somebody does get phished or whatever, it's because they're, I don't know, they're checking their phone while they're, uh, being driven somewhere.
[4717.94 → 4720.20] Or they're having a conversation with somebody.
[4720.28 → 4721.02] You were barbecuing.
[4721.10 → 4722.26] Like there's some amount of distraction.
[4722.42 → 4723.16] There's something going on.
[4723.16 → 4726.04] I was in the middle of like a bar, a family barbecue.
[4726.04 → 4729.12] You probably Troy, many other people.
[4729.34 → 4734.52] They're not, they get too many emails to be fully paying attention to every single one they ever receive.
[4734.94 → 4736.80] And like pixel peeping every letter.
[4736.94 → 4738.98] Like it's, it's just not really going to happen.
[4739.12 → 4743.88] So I think this is a pretty good counter to the like, Oh, but it wouldn't happen to me.
[4744.18 → 4746.94] It happened to Troy freaking Hunt.
[4746.94 → 4757.58] So your argument is that it will help destigmatize getting pwned and making it so that we talk about it more, which will spread awareness of pwned ness.
[4757.84 → 4758.04] Yeah.
[4758.20 → 4762.14] And a lot of the comments that I've seen so far are actually like, Oh wow.
[4762.92 → 4764.10] It happened to him.
[4764.50 → 4764.90] Cool.
[4764.90 → 4767.96] Which I think is like a good takeaway from this.
[4768.00 → 4771.32] It's like, yeah, I mean, it happened to him and I wouldn't shame him for it.
[4772.10 → 4773.04] The stuff happens.
[4773.34 → 4777.66] And like we have, I mean, we have training now here and all this other kind of stuff.
[4777.80 → 4779.50] It's still possible that it could happen to us.
[4779.82 → 4784.62] Hopefully the training and whatnot will reduce the amount of times that it happens by making people more aware.
[4784.62 → 4788.88] But you're never going to be 100% on the ball all the time.
[4788.88 → 4801.28] Now, if someone here fails their, their training like multiple times, or they make mistakes multiple times, and it's the same person, then that starts to be like, okay, like you need to take this more seriously.
[4801.82 → 4804.72] Um, because we're going to send out like fishing tests again.
[4804.86 → 4805.36] We did one.
[4805.44 → 4806.50] We're going to do more in the future.
[4806.50 → 4809.54] And if the same person keeps coming up, that's a red flag.
[4809.60 → 4816.76] But if you make like one mistake, ideally it's on one of the tests, and then you don't make a mistake again, and then we're golden.
[4816.76 → 4820.34] Um, but yeah, I don't know.
[4821.32 → 4822.22] I was so ready.
[4822.40 → 4823.12] I was so ready.
[4823.20 → 4824.12] I wasn't even going to say it.
[4824.14 → 4827.56] Then I saw your hand queue up for it, and I was like, I'm in, I'm totally in.
[4828.38 → 4829.42] Dive for the content.
[4829.58 → 4830.06] Oh man.
[4830.22 → 4831.36] Um, yeah.
[4831.38 → 4834.70] So ultimately, I mean, it wasn't a good thing that those people's emails linked.
[4834.76 → 4835.94] It wasn't like those things are good.
[4835.96 → 4836.34] Yeah, that sucks.
[4836.44 → 4836.94] Of course.
[4837.24 → 4841.92] But, uh, it's like looking at how many times this stuff happens, the chance of those people's emails
[4841.92 → 4845.60] leaking, uh, leaking, um, I mean somewhere.
[4845.60 → 4847.60] They could lose a lot more than just their emails.
[4847.86 → 4851.24] 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
[4851.96 → 4853.18] 23andMe Holding Co.
[4853.56 → 4857.18] is attempting to facilitate a sale by filing for Chapter 11.
[4857.46 → 4865.18] The company was briefly valued at $6 billion in 2021, but has more recently been valued at
[4865.18 → 4870.24] $50 million after failing to turn a profit after all this time.
[4870.24 → 4873.42] Co-founder and CEO Ann Warwick.
[4874.28 → 4874.66] What?
[4875.90 → 4876.42] Warwick?
[4877.02 → 4878.56] I've never heard it pronounced like that.
[4879.02 → 4881.72] I always heard it Warwick when it was, uh, YouTube.
[4881.96 → 4883.16] Is it the same spelling?
[4883.54 → 4884.42] No, they're sisters.
[4884.66 → 4884.88] Oh.
[4885.00 → 4885.92] Or were sisters.
[4886.26 → 4886.98] Rip Susan.
[4887.54 → 4887.96] Um.
[4888.14 → 4888.28] Mm.
[4888.28 → 4894.22] Uh, Ann announced her immediate resignation and is making an independent bid for the company.
[4894.44 → 4899.16] The company intends to keep operating through bankruptcy proceedings and says that customer
[4899.16 → 4903.24] access to data and subscriptions won't be affected.
[4906.18 → 4907.52] But will it though?
[4908.16 → 4908.92] Won't it though?
[4909.32 → 4909.52] Yeah.
[4909.52 → 4910.60] But won't it though?
[4911.56 → 4923.60] Man, I am so freaking not happy about being right that entrusting your genetic information
[4923.60 → 4928.60] to some Silicon Valley startup is not going to work out.
[4928.80 → 4930.44] And I freaking called it.
[4930.92 → 4931.70] I'm hard to.
[4931.78 → 4932.74] I'm got a lot of pushbacks.
[4932.74 → 4940.54] I'm still extremely upset with a relative of mine for selling me and the rest of our
[4940.54 → 4946.02] entire family from now until forever down the river for what out of idle curiosity that
[4946.02 → 4949.08] it's such a stupid f***ING reason to do that.
[4949.84 → 4956.36] Um, I don't blame anyone who didn't know, but in this case, I explicitly laid out why it's
[4956.36 → 4959.94] a terrible, terrible idea and was ignored.
[4960.46 → 4962.10] Um, that's different.
[4962.74 → 4967.84] The verge has a great guide on how to delete your 23andMe data.
[4968.00 → 4969.92] So I would recommend you guys check that out.
[4970.52 → 4975.66] And our discussion question here is if you were the new owners of 23andMe, what would
[4975.66 → 4977.94] you do to become profitable?
[4979.16 → 4984.62] And I think that's the that's, I guess I kind of jumped to the end of that conversation
[4984.62 → 4991.28] when I said, Hey, all this data is effectively just it's out there now because the first thing
[4991.28 → 4997.22] that I would do if I was trying to make 23andMe profitable, and I was unscrupulous is I just
[4997.22 → 4997.72] sell the data.
[4999.02 → 5000.14] Sell it to the highest bidder.
[5000.52 → 5002.46] Give access to insurance companies.
[5002.60 → 5008.20] Give access to, um, I mean, yeah, insurance companies are the ones that would probably be
[5008.20 → 5009.44] most interested in it.
[5009.44 → 5013.48] Because a lot of this information is useful for the entire family.
[5013.48 → 5018.18] And I've heard, dude, I've heard a, I've heard a ton of Americans in our chat being like,
[5018.26 → 5022.10] well, they're not allowed to, they're not allowed to use that for coverage.
[5022.30 → 5027.26] This dude, insurance companies are already using information that they're like not allowed
[5027.26 → 5031.66] to use when it comes to evaluating how much to charge you for things.
[5031.66 → 5038.24] Like, it's just a matter of when and how they're going to be busted and whether your watchdogs
[5038.24 → 5043.98] are going to have any kind of teeth to fight back when it happens, which right now is not
[5043.98 → 5045.40] looking good, quite frankly.
[5045.90 → 5051.06] So, um, yeah, this blows, this absolutely blows.
[5051.78 → 5056.42] And, um, to be clear, I don't care that 23andMe is going under.
[5056.42 → 5065.46] Um, I just think this really sucks for the families of people who gave data to this company
[5065.46 → 5069.18] and are now able to be exploited.
[5070.18 → 5070.74] Sucks.
[5072.20 → 5073.34] Yeah, this is interesting.
[5073.50 → 5077.30] GM wasn't allowed to share your driving data, but did without consent to your actual insurance
[5077.30 → 5077.60] provider.
[5077.66 → 5081.10] And that data is permanently housed in third-party databases that all insurance companies have
[5081.10 → 5081.62] access to.
[5081.70 → 5081.88] Yeah.
[5081.88 → 5083.86] Like this, there's, there's precedent for this stuff.
[5083.86 → 5084.30] Yeah.
[5084.40 → 5085.86] Oh, a hundred percent.
[5085.86 → 5087.94] If you disagree with me, you're actually wrong.
[5088.22 → 5090.22] So, um, cool.
[5090.74 → 5091.00] Yeah.
[5091.22 → 5092.40] Enjoy being wrong though.
[5092.52 → 5094.10] I mean, some people like it.
[5094.74 → 5096.28] Some people like it a lot.
[5097.86 → 5099.94] Uh, you know what?
[5100.02 → 5101.46] Some people don't like it.
[5101.94 → 5105.66] Um, oh wait, I should talk about our sponsors first.
[5106.76 → 5108.72] The show is brought to you today by AMD.
[5109.98 → 5113.40] Massive shout out to our longtime partner and sponsor AMD.
[5113.40 → 5119.24] You might've seen our AMD $5,000 ultimate tech upgrade series, but if you haven't, you can
[5119.24 → 5122.50] check out the most recent episode where we upgraded Artie's setup.
[5122.72 → 5124.64] Dude, how much do you love that geek squad helmet?
[5124.76 → 5125.54] I found it's great.
[5125.66 → 5126.48] It's his dad's.
[5126.56 → 5126.78] Yeah.
[5126.86 → 5129.68] I went spelunking in his basement or in his crawl space.
[5129.76 → 5130.14] I know.
[5130.46 → 5131.54] Um, oh, did you watch it?
[5131.76 → 5131.78] Yeah.
[5131.78 → 5131.94] Yeah.
[5131.94 → 5132.04] Yeah.
[5132.04 → 5133.96] Oh dude, his crawl space is epic.
[5134.10 → 5138.56] I wanted to like to make an entire channel where I just crawl around in people's crawl spaces
[5138.56 → 5139.48] and find tech stuff.
[5139.56 → 5140.46] It would be an amazing show.
[5140.64 → 5141.36] That would be sick.
[5141.48 → 5144.76] Anyway, um, it says talk about the experience with Artie.
[5144.86 → 5145.18] Oh cool.
[5145.24 → 5145.70] I did that.
[5145.90 → 5148.40] And highlight one of the most challenging upgrades.
[5149.20 → 5151.50] Oh, I mean, they're always really fun.
[5151.58 → 5152.60] I don't, I don't really know.
[5152.70 → 5154.20] I don't really know what's challenging about them.
[5154.20 → 5160.76] I, I actually, AMD ultimate tech upgrade is one of the few times that I get to spend
[5160.76 → 5163.74] one-on-one time with our rank and file team members.
[5164.12 → 5166.14] I almost never get to hang it.
[5166.16 → 5171.10] Like I was, I was, uh, I was noticing this as, uh, Bridget and I were filming hers yesterday.
[5171.36 → 5174.00] Uh, so Bridget is, well, there you go.
[5174.28 → 5176.64] Uh, Bridget, which camera, that one, right?
[5177.08 → 5177.30] Yes.
[5177.32 → 5181.28] That one, uh, Bridget, um, leads the fashion team for creator warehouse.
[5181.28 → 5185.04] And I was like, dude, we like never talk anymore.
[5185.50 → 5188.48] Cause like we just have merch meeting, which is like a group meeting.
[5188.48 → 5190.12] Like we never like too many layers.
[5190.24 → 5190.32] Yeah.
[5190.32 → 5191.82] We never, we never talk anymore.
[5191.96 → 5192.70] And it was cool.
[5192.70 → 5198.80] Cause like we haven't like really had a long conversation in like three years or something
[5198.80 → 5199.16] like that.
[5199.18 → 5200.72] Like she's been here for years now.
[5201.14 → 5202.38] Um, so yeah, it was, it was cool.
[5202.38 → 5203.62] Because we got to like reconnect.
[5204.28 → 5206.74] Um, so that's, that's one of the things I love most about it.
[5206.80 → 5210.26] I don't, I don't really, I don't really find any of them that challenging anyway.
[5210.26 → 5214.04] Now's your chance to win a sweet, sweet treat from AMD.
[5214.28 → 5217.06] And you don't even have to work at Linus media group or create a warehouse or float plane.
[5217.22 → 5217.50] What?
[5217.92 → 5219.34] And this treat isn't just sweet.
[5219.46 → 5225.70] It's the hottest new Radeon 9070 XT graphics card.
[5226.04 → 5228.10] Did that say signed by Dr. Lisa Sue?
[5228.18 → 5229.06] I think I saw that.
[5229.16 → 5230.06] You've got to be kidding me.
[5230.70 → 5238.86] AMD is giving away three 9070 XTs that are signed by AMD chair and CEO, Dr. Lisa Sue.
[5238.86 → 5240.52] That's super cool.
[5240.64 → 5243.00] Just head to the link in the video description to enter.

[5248.48 → 5249.50] Dude, that's so cool.

[5368.72 → 5369.70] All right.
[5370.02 → 5372.46] So I didn't expect this.
[5372.46 → 5378.52] Um, but Guildford uploaded an apology video last week.
[5379.02 → 5383.58] Um, and I was very surprised.
[5383.90 → 5392.42] Basically what he said is, Hey, I wasn't wrong in my criticism of, um, the way that Linus
[5392.42 → 5398.86] Tech Tips presented their information about the, uh, the combining of the 12 volt pins on
[5398.86 → 5405.72] the non-founders edition 5090s, but what was wrong and not cool was just the aggressive
[5405.72 → 5406.10] tone.
[5406.20 → 5406.82] It was unnecessary.
[5406.94 → 5407.80] It was uncalled-for.
[5407.94 → 5409.22] And I want to be better.
[5409.68 → 5412.68] And I guess here's what I have to say.
[5412.76 → 5415.14] Maybe the original video was clout chase.
[5415.50 → 5424.54] Um, if it was, I don't care because nothing is irredeemable and a simple apology and retraction
[5424.54 → 5429.62] is all I have ever asked of anyone in that spirit.
[5429.62 → 5434.62] Then, um, I could have brought my concerns to Guildford directly as well, rather than talking
[5434.62 → 5435.50] about it on WINSLOW.
[5436.10 → 5441.64] Um, I could have made my case that it felt like a bad faith move for him to criticize in
[5441.64 → 5442.76] public before reaching out.
[5443.84 → 5445.54] I could have said that I didn't.
[5445.62 → 5447.24] And I'm sorry for that as well.
[5447.24 → 5449.70] I think we can all do better.
[5450.08 → 5456.06] And I, I don't know, I guess for my part, I've just, I'm feeling just so done with this
[5456.06 → 5459.88] whole thing where I get shots taken at me, and I get, I get held to the standard of
[5459.88 → 5464.66] perfection in public that I never set for myself, that I never set for anyone else.
[5464.88 → 5467.86] But like my baggage here is not his fault.
[5468.14 → 5469.32] That's not his problem.
[5469.32 → 5475.96] And I got to say like his refreshing willingness to take responsibility for his demeanour when
[5475.96 → 5480.40] his critique, when his critique wasn't wrong, right?
[5480.52 → 5480.68] Yeah.
[5481.46 → 5487.14] But still taking apology, taking accountability for just being like kind of dick about it
[5487.14 → 5491.82] though, has restored some of my faith in the ability of the tech media to work together.
[5492.08 → 5495.08] Speaking of his critique not being wrong, I was happy that in the video he pointed out
[5495.08 → 5497.30] that he wasn't going to not critique in the future.
[5497.40 → 5497.86] Yeah, sure.
[5497.90 → 5498.60] Which is like cool.
[5498.80 → 5499.00] Yeah.
[5499.10 → 5499.56] That's fine.
[5499.58 → 5501.02] We don't want to be wrong.
[5501.72 → 5501.96] Yeah.
[5501.96 → 5506.66] So like, yeah, I would rather you correct it so that we're not wrong.
[5506.78 → 5508.90] I would like to update things so that we're not wrong.
[5508.90 → 5509.02] Yeah.
[5509.02 → 5512.44] We want to continue to be less wrong as time goes on.
[5512.62 → 5516.56] Everyone should want to be like, that's the whole idea with scientific things, right?
[5516.56 → 5520.44] Is that other people look at it and question it and come back at you.
[5520.52 → 5520.64] Yeah.
[5520.72 → 5522.56] So like we do want that.
[5522.62 → 5523.18] That is good.
[5523.62 → 5525.24] And like, yeah, I don't know.
[5525.40 → 5525.92] I'll leave it there.
[5526.08 → 5526.26] Yeah.
[5526.26 → 5530.28] So as far as I'm concerned, water 100% under the bridge.
[5530.88 → 5533.44] I'd love to have opportunities to work together in the future.
[5534.46 → 5539.94] And, you know, everyone who speculated under his video that it had anything to do with us
[5539.94 → 5542.38] sending any kind of legal thread or anything like that.
[5542.38 → 5542.98] No, not at all.
[5543.00 → 5544.20] You can go f*** yourself because...
[5544.20 → 5545.58] I don't think we had any direct communication.
[5545.62 → 5546.18] No, of course not.
[5546.30 → 5546.44] Yeah.
[5546.62 → 5547.50] I don't know, dude.
[5547.54 → 5550.22] I'm so tired of people making assumptions about us.
[5550.22 → 5556.02] What if someone was kind of a d*** and realized they were kind of a d*** and they shouldn't?
[5557.20 → 5558.20] And then they apologized.
[5558.54 → 5558.80] It was really cool.
[5558.80 → 5562.90] And then what if the person that they were kind of a d*** to realized that they were
[5562.90 → 5567.48] kind of d*** too and was like, hey, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.
[5567.72 → 5572.20] And then what if they found a way to like work together and that was just cool for everyone?
[5572.38 → 5573.36] Based, based, based.
[5574.00 → 5574.20] Yeah.
[5574.50 → 5575.76] What if it was just...
[5575.76 → 5580.32] What if the world was just actually that simple and actually that healthy?
[5580.36 → 5580.54] What?
[5580.62 → 5580.80] No.
[5581.44 → 5581.82] I know.
[5581.96 → 5582.32] Not allowed.
[5582.54 → 5582.88] I know.
[5582.88 → 5584.88] Anyway, so I thought I...
[5584.88 → 5587.84] I was like blown away.
[5588.04 → 5589.44] I, uh...
[5589.44 → 5591.18] I braced so hard.
[5592.26 → 5592.84] For what?
[5592.84 → 5593.32] So hard.
[5593.90 → 5595.46] You didn't message me at all.
[5595.68 → 5597.36] You just, uh...
[5597.36 → 5599.14] Google shared me on a doc.
[5599.94 → 5600.62] For what?
[5600.62 → 5602.28] It said like something, something apology.
[5603.20 → 5605.78] And I was like, oh, no.
[5607.86 → 5609.34] I'm ready to go.
[5609.34 → 5611.18] And then I open it.
[5611.24 → 5611.82] I'm like, oh.
[5612.48 → 5613.04] Yeah, it's chill.
[5613.14 → 5613.62] Oh, okay, cool.
[5613.68 → 5614.42] Yeah, everything's chill.
[5614.66 → 5614.80] Yeah.
[5615.14 → 5616.88] Um, cool.
[5617.18 → 5617.88] We don't have the collab.
[5617.96 → 5623.58] And just to clarify, not only did I not threaten any kind of legal action to build Void,
[5623.58 → 5630.72] um, I have made it very clear many times in the past, I am not a litigious person and
[5630.72 → 5633.02] I have never sued anybody.
[5633.22 → 5635.22] Yeah, so we weren't, we weren't going to do that in the first place.
[5635.28 → 5637.16] Yeah, because that's like, because it's...
[5637.16 → 5638.18] Obviously the wrong move.
[5638.42 → 5638.78] Stupid.
[5639.04 → 5639.26] Yeah.
[5639.42 → 5640.80] It's like actually stupid.
[5640.80 → 5646.64] I think even on like a strictly like corporate hat on sense.
[5647.32 → 5647.64] It's stupid.
[5647.64 → 5649.30] I'm going to back you up on this a little bit.
[5649.56 → 5652.22] I think this ties into the whole backpacks thing a little bit.
[5652.46 → 5658.24] Like not taking care of people if they had backpack problems would have just had the community
[5658.24 → 5659.36] turn on us immediately.
[5659.50 → 5659.94] Well, yeah, of course.
[5660.28 → 5665.92] And like going after someone for something like this legally, everyone would just hate
[5665.92 → 5666.60] us immediately.
[5666.84 → 5667.06] Yeah.
[5667.24 → 5668.12] Because, yeah.
[5668.12 → 5670.10] Well, they hate us for doing it even though we didn't do it.
[5670.34 → 5670.78] Yeah.
[5670.80 → 5672.14] The latest one ever.
[5672.76 → 5675.58] How dare you do this thing that I made up that you did?
[5676.32 → 5677.86] What are you even talking about?
[5677.96 → 5682.90] I don't, I don't actually think a lot of people know why they hate me.
[5683.54 → 5684.50] It's, it's fun.
[5684.58 → 5685.08] It's something to do.
[5686.06 → 5686.44] I guess.
[5686.46 → 5688.32] Cut down the tall stock or whatever that was.
[5688.32 → 5689.20] It's a weird hobby, dude.
[5689.44 → 5691.00] That's a weird hobby.
[5692.36 → 5694.04] It's something to do.
[5694.62 → 5697.32] Dan laughs like you haven't heard of some hobbies.
[5697.32 → 5701.24] Oh, I was laughing at your cutting down the tall stock.
[5701.42 → 5701.90] Oh, yeah.
[5702.06 → 5702.32] Yeah.
[5702.80 → 5703.20] Oh, wait.
[5703.34 → 5705.48] It's a good reason to hate Linus.
[5707.48 → 5708.92] I thought that's what you said.
[5709.02 → 5709.58] That's why I was laughing.
[5709.58 → 5712.48] That is what I said, but I didn't mean it as in like his actual height.
[5712.60 → 5713.60] Speaking of dicks.
[5713.60 → 5717.88] I was also talking about the clothes too.
[5719.76 → 5720.86] You went there.
[5721.20 → 5722.06] Oh my God.
[5722.16 → 5723.16] I thought you did.
[5723.28 → 5723.52] No.
[5723.94 → 5724.50] That's my bad.
[5724.52 → 5725.38] That's really mean.
[5725.48 → 5727.94] He's very sensitive about his immune status.
[5727.94 → 5739.02] Why don't we talk about some AI things this week?
[5739.02 → 5740.72] I wasn't even talking about the clothes either.
[5741.74 → 5742.88] I was, oh man.
[5743.60 → 5744.02] Whatever.
[5744.34 → 5744.88] It's fine.
[5745.14 → 5745.36] See?
[5745.56 → 5746.24] Fun hobby.
[5749.24 → 5749.88] Oh.
[5750.74 → 5751.06] Yeah.
[5751.96 → 5754.22] Let's talk about some AI things this week.
[5754.66 → 5757.64] NVIDIA is rolling out Project G-Assist.
[5758.44 → 5763.32] It's AI assistant that can run locally on your GPU and is apparently named after the
[5763.32 → 5768.44] company's fake AI assistant from their April Fool's joke in 2017.
[5769.24 → 5770.28] I remember that.
[5770.28 → 5770.80] Oh, yeah.
[5770.80 → 5774.72] I still have one of these because I thought these were so cool.
[5774.78 → 5776.10] These were really cool, actually.
[5776.10 → 5780.42] The little USB drive that looked like it.
[5780.64 → 5780.66] Yeah.
[5780.76 → 5781.48] This was awesome.
[5782.80 → 5783.64] That's super cool.
[5783.80 → 5787.22] A lot of their April Fool's jokes have been, this isn't one, I don't think, but a lot
[5787.22 → 5789.28] of their April Fool's jokes have actually been fantastic.
[5790.00 → 5795.16] Running locally on your NVIDIA GPU, G-Assist can do normal AI stuff like answer questions,
[5795.28 → 5801.22] but it can also control some third-party accessories through API integrations and change some performance-related
[5801.22 → 5804.00] settings instead of just telling you how to do that.
[5804.42 → 5808.32] That means that somehow NVIDIA made a more useful AI assistant for Windows than Microsoft.
[5808.80 → 5809.14] Wow.
[5809.14 → 5811.60] Good job.
[5811.66 → 5814.18] If only you could afford a GPU that used it.
[5814.18 → 5819.36] In other AI news that's actually worth mentioning, Character.ai has announced a parental control
[5819.36 → 5822.54] feature in the wake of a 14-year-old user.
[5823.32 → 5823.72] Ooh.
[5825.02 → 5825.62] Um.
[5826.98 → 5827.66] Wow.
[5829.58 → 5836.14] Unliving themselves after being encouraged to do so by one of the company's bots.
[5836.14 → 5838.38] That's another one.
[5838.38 → 5846.50] In addition, shortly after this incident, multiple bots impersonating the deceased 14-year-old
[5846.50 → 5848.74] had to be taken off the platform.
[5851.02 → 5851.46] Um.
[5852.02 → 5855.84] Is this, is this, did the incident happen a while ago or is this new?
[5856.86 → 5858.34] Because I know this happened a while ago.
[5858.34 → 5859.16] No, in the wake of.
[5859.30 → 5860.54] I don't know if this is a new one.
[5860.56 → 5861.98] So this is hopefully not new.
[5861.98 → 5863.30] Uh, I didn't look.
[5863.94 → 5869.14] The new feature is called Parental Insights and lets users under 18 send a weekly activity
[5869.14 → 5870.74] report to their parent or guardian.
[5871.38 → 5872.34] If they want to.
[5872.34 → 5872.78] If they want to.
[5872.80 → 5874.06] They're never going to.
[5874.78 → 5878.50] Kids can enable the report in their account preferences, which will share.
[5878.50 → 5879.18] That's not how that works.
[5879.18 → 5883.00] Their daily average time spent on the platform, the top characters they interacted with, and
[5883.00 → 5885.00] the amount of time they spent with each character.
[5886.26 → 5890.06] Character.ai says this is a first step in providing parents with information about their
[5890.06 → 5890.74] kids' use of the server.
[5890.82 → 5892.62] Why, why would you, why wouldn't you just take.
[5892.72 → 5895.90] Start with putting the parental controls on the parent's side.
[5896.94 → 5897.36] What are we.
[5897.36 → 5898.26] That's the first step.
[5898.26 → 5898.62] Oh.
[5899.30 → 5900.12] That's stupid.
[5900.52 → 5900.74] Yeah.
[5900.78 → 5905.46] Like if you're the kind of kid that's like voluntarily being like, yes, I would like to send a usage
[5905.46 → 5906.44] report to my parents.
[5906.44 → 5910.42] That's not the kind that we need this for.
[5913.14 → 5913.50] Oh.
[5916.02 → 5916.86] My goodness.
[5918.72 → 5919.16] Okay.
[5919.16 → 5919.52] Okay.
[5920.24 → 5922.26] In other news, Nintendo.
[5922.76 → 5923.60] This is cool.
[5924.28 → 5928.00] Adds family sharing to switch digital libraries.
[5928.36 → 5928.58] Whoa.
[5929.20 → 5931.32] In an uncommon W.
[5931.54 → 5931.86] What?
[5931.86 → 5933.60] Consumer friendly move by Big Red.
[5934.10 → 5940.00] Nintendo is allowing players to more easily share games across multiple systems that are
[5940.00 → 5945.62] logged into the same Nintendo account with a virtual game card that can be ejected and
[5945.62 → 5946.48] then loaded.
[5947.62 → 5948.34] Game cards.
[5948.76 → 5949.04] Whoa.
[5949.16 → 5954.44] Can also be lent to different accounts in the same Nintendo family group.
[5954.44 → 5960.38] In order to lend a virtual game card, both consoles need to be connected to the same network
[5960.38 → 5967.28] and internet during the sharing process and the lender to the internet for the initial
[5967.28 → 5968.56] game launch.
[5968.66 → 5968.92] Wait, what?
[5969.18 → 5969.46] What?
[5969.46 → 5972.40] The first time they load the game.
[5972.40 → 5973.06] Oh.
[5973.06 → 5976.40] Has to be connected to the internet for the initial game launch.
[5976.40 → 5976.58] Yeah.
[5976.58 → 5981.82] After that, the borrowed license will last for 14 days without requiring internet access.
[5981.92 → 5983.56] And then I wouldn't be surprised if you could do it again.
[5983.56 → 5984.56] That is so cool.
[5984.56 → 5985.56] That is so cool.
[5985.56 → 5987.96] I think what they're saying is you could use it mobile for 14 days.
[5988.00 → 5989.50] So you could be on other networks for 14 days.
[5989.50 → 5990.50] That is so cool.
[5990.50 → 5990.56] That is so cool.
[5990.56 → 5992.28] That's actually like pretty sick.
[5992.28 → 5993.78] So when I chat, I said, thanks Gabon.
[5993.78 → 5998.22] And honestly, sometimes I like to dunk on Steam because people are like too nice to Steam sometimes.
[5998.22 → 5999.28] But I think that's fair.
[5999.28 → 6003.94] I think this is going to put a ton of pressure on Microsoft and Sony too.
[6003.94 → 6004.42] Yeah.
[6004.98 → 6006.40] Like that's been a huge thing.
[6006.46 → 6011.88] I mean, we made a whole video about it earlier last year when we talked about digital versus
[6011.88 → 6017.12] physical games and the whole resale and lending being a huge plus for physical games.
[6017.22 → 6023.64] But this changes the calculus quite a lot because most people, I mean, you're still not able to
[6023.64 → 6024.02] sell them.
[6024.22 → 6026.52] So there's still room to improve.
[6026.74 → 6026.96] Yeah.
[6027.04 → 6032.52] But most people that I would lend a game to are people that I could pretty easily be on
[6032.52 → 6033.40] the same Wi-Fi as.
[6034.54 → 6035.42] That's super cool.
[6035.50 → 6038.06] And this seems like it'd be pretty easy to fake.
[6038.80 → 6039.54] Just saying.
[6039.86 → 6040.52] Oh, yeah.
[6040.72 → 6042.06] Like trivially easy.
[6042.18 → 6042.34] Yeah.
[6042.44 → 6044.18] To pretend to be on the same network.
[6044.80 → 6045.28] But you're right.
[6045.46 → 6045.62] Yeah.
[6045.70 → 6047.04] But yeah, most people won't.
[6047.26 → 6047.72] Very cool.
[6048.28 → 6053.64] Do you think that this is less to do with Valve and more to do with Nintendo recognizing that
[6053.64 → 6055.98] they have real competition in the handheld space now?
[6057.68 → 6058.56] Including Valve?
[6058.60 → 6062.44] Because remember that, but also including piracy of their own games.
[6063.16 → 6063.64] Hmm.
[6063.94 → 6064.38] Hmm.
[6064.38 → 6069.76] Because remember, one of the biggest deterrents for pirates is making legitimate ownership
[6069.76 → 6070.28] better.
[6070.46 → 6070.92] Easier and better.
[6071.24 → 6071.44] Yeah.
[6071.52 → 6073.36] That's why movie piracy is coming back.
[6073.82 → 6078.42] Um, our discussion question here is, have you ever had a hard time getting a digital
[6078.42 → 6080.28] game to work on a secondary Switch?
[6080.38 → 6081.52] I have while travelling.
[6081.52 → 6082.48] The plane ride sucked.
[6082.66 → 6083.86] F you past Nintendo.
[6083.86 → 6084.88] And thank you current Nintendo.
[6084.98 → 6085.08] Okay.
[6085.08 → 6085.80] Who did this topic?
[6085.92 → 6086.84] I don't even know who wrote that.
[6086.84 → 6087.46] I don't know what that means.
[6088.36 → 6089.20] I also don't know what that means.
[6089.36 → 6090.78] Uh, they, they, they weren't online.
[6090.78 → 6091.78] Yeah.
[6091.78 → 6091.84] Yeah.
[6092.48 → 6094.22] They couldn't get it working on their secondary Switch.
[6094.22 → 6095.92] I didn't know that was a thing at all.
[6096.02 → 6097.98] I only have one Switch, so I didn't either.
[6098.18 → 6098.32] Yeah.
[6098.32 → 6100.30] But apparently it is.
[6100.38 → 6100.70] Okay.
[6100.70 → 6107.18] Canada is freezing rebates being paid to Tesla and barring them from any future rebate
[6107.18 → 6107.70] programs.
[6107.70 → 6108.10] Yeah.
[6108.28 → 6114.86] This is after Tesla filed an unbelievable number of EV rebate claims, including almost
[6114.86 → 6122.58] $20 million Canadian from over 4,000 auto sales at one Quebec City dealer in a single
[6122.58 → 6123.00] weekend.
[6124.66 → 6128.90] I actually, I saw an article about this where someone did the math for like how many cars
[6128.90 → 6129.82] they would have had to sell.
[6129.82 → 6130.82] They would have had to sell a car.
[6130.82 → 6131.04] Yeah.
[6131.18 → 6135.30] It was like every two minutes they would have had to sell a car and there's like just no
[6135.30 → 6136.04] way that happened.
[6136.04 → 6136.48] Yeah.
[6136.62 → 6139.12] Um, yeah.
[6139.34 → 6139.86] Ridiculous.
[6140.16 → 6145.58] So the Canadian federal government has frozen 43 million Canadian dollars in rebate payments,
[6145.58 → 6151.94] um, until each claim is individually investigated and determined to be valid.
[6152.66 → 6156.76] Transport Canada has also been directed to change the eligibility requirements for future
[6156.76 → 6162.46] rebate programs to ensure that Tesla's no longer qualify while the illegitimate and illegal
[6162.46 → 6164.24] U S tariffs are imposed against Canada.
[6165.88 → 6166.36] Fascinating.
[6166.60 → 6167.14] Oh man.
[6167.20 → 6170.32] It's, we are, we are headed for very interesting times.
[6170.44 → 6172.22] Isn't it so cool being in a trade war?
[6172.22 → 6176.70] Um, no, I love it.
[6177.22 → 6183.24] I mean, other things that I love to include YouTube tests, turning off channel notifications for
[6183.24 → 6184.24] overwhelmed users.
[6186.16 → 6190.70] YouTube says it's running a small experiment in which it turns off notifications to certain
[6190.70 → 6191.06] channels.
[6191.12 → 6195.90] A user subscribed to the company says the test will impact viewers who are subscribed to
[6195.90 → 6199.38] a channel and have set notifications for that channel to all yet.
[6199.38 → 6204.16] Haven't recently interacted with those notifications actively engaged users with push notifications
[6204.16 → 6204.56] enabled.
[6204.56 → 6206.26] We'll continue to receive them.
[6206.72 → 6211.50] YouTube wants to prevent users from turning on off all notifications from the YouTube app
[6211.50 → 6217.56] entirely, which may, uh, which they may often do when they've opted to receive all notifications
[6217.56 → 6219.02] from many channels.
[6219.30 → 6219.40] Yeah.
[6219.50 → 6223.42] YouTube would prefer users to update their channel specific preferences in the app instead.
[6224.08 → 6225.80] Uh, but they were never going to do that.
[6225.80 → 6226.52] So here we are.
[6226.52 → 6230.90] YouTube says channels that upload infrequently will not have the notifications affected.
[6230.90 → 6234.62] Although it didn't specify what qualifies as infrequently.
[6234.86 → 6240.16] YouTube is of course interested in taking measures that will encourage user engagement, but it also
[6240.16 → 6245.24] says that users choosing to disable notifications entirely can negatively impact creators.
[6246.32 → 6250.60] Discussion question is where do you draw the line in terms of the actions platforms can
[6250.60 → 6251.78] take to protect their metrics?
[6251.78 → 6257.12] Does disable notifications for specific channels count as a platform change or interfering
[6257.12 → 6258.22] with user autonomy?
[6259.06 → 6259.90] What user autonomy?
[6260.06 → 6263.98] I mean, YouTube's been fully algorithmic for years and years and years at this point.
[6264.18 → 6265.34] I honestly thought they already did this.
[6265.46 → 6265.64] Yeah.
[6265.76 → 6269.00] I, I, I was surprised to read that this was news.
[6269.24 → 6269.42] Yeah.
[6269.50 → 6271.28] So I guess that's all I really have to say about that.
[6271.34 → 6273.14] Why don't we flip over to after dark?
[6273.44 → 6273.72] Yeah.
[6273.72 → 6277.94] It does annoy me a little bit because I wonder how they measure this.
[6278.06 → 6279.22] Cause you know what annoys me?
[6279.44 → 6282.76] The fact that I have land gaming to do, and you're dragging out this last topic.
[6283.06 → 6284.58] One small additional thing to say.
[6284.90 → 6289.28] I, uh, I don't really like watching YouTube on my phone, so I'll sometimes use it as a
[6289.28 → 6293.74] notification engine, but I'll swipe it away and then go watch that video later on my
[6293.74 → 6293.98] desktop.
[6294.06 → 6294.62] Oh, interesting.
[6295.54 → 6295.90] Fascinating.
[6295.90 → 6296.22] Okay.
[6296.38 → 6297.36] Now it's time for after dark.
[6303.40 → 6309.66] Hey, Hey Linus, a while ago I got a survey due to an LTT purchase on when you said you
[6309.66 → 6313.32] disagree with it fundamentally, but you are acquiescing to the team.
[6313.66 → 6317.02] Do you have any outcomes or thoughts about any of this?
[6317.10 → 6317.24] Yeah.
[6317.32 → 6320.80] So the part that I fundamentally disagreed with was how much we paid for it.
[6321.02 → 6321.28] Yeah.
[6321.60 → 6323.22] It was really expensive.
[6324.32 → 6324.72] Yeah.
[6324.72 → 6329.72] I don't remember the exact amount, but it was with like a fancy, do you want to just
[6329.72 → 6330.08] tell them?
[6330.26 → 6330.40] No.
[6331.10 → 6332.26] Oh, okay.
[6333.10 → 6333.46] Yeah.
[6333.46 → 6333.92] Go away.
[6334.40 → 6335.48] We're not always transparent.
[6335.76 → 6336.08] What now?
[6336.30 → 6337.06] I'm curious.
[6337.22 → 6337.54] Fight me.
[6338.80 → 6339.60] You don't know it?
[6339.88 → 6340.20] Yeah.
[6340.28 → 6340.68] I don't remember.
[6340.70 → 6341.28] You can't get out of me.
[6342.76 → 6343.14] Nice try.
[6343.22 → 6346.02] What a weird, what a weird thing to get aggressive about.
[6346.14 → 6346.84] It was so much.
[6346.96 → 6347.12] Yeah.
[6347.12 → 6347.94] It was a lot of money.
[6348.00 → 6350.90] It was definitely more than $10,000.
[6350.90 → 6354.68] I don't remember how much it was.
[6354.82 → 6355.32] Yeah.
[6355.68 → 6356.12] Okay.
[6356.18 → 6363.64] Well, the point is that I felt a lot of the things that we were asking were things that
[6363.64 → 6374.24] were fairly easily ascertainable by just looking at past sales data and, you know, looking
[6374.24 → 6378.86] at customer profile data that we kind of have from just our YouTube viewers.
[6378.86 → 6383.70] However, the argument that was made to me was that our YouTube demographics are not necessarily
[6383.70 → 6386.40] identical to our creator warehouse demographics.
[6386.72 → 6391.94] And that if we ever want to have any hope of growing beyond our current customer base,
[6392.06 → 6398.22] we should work to understand things about them other than that they watch LTT.
[6398.22 → 6407.22] And so I basically said, okay, maybe there's something useful that we obtained from it.
[6407.44 → 6412.86] I think that at some point in that conversation, I basically said, okay, well, yeah, I'll write
[6412.86 → 6417.34] the check, but I would like us to define what success for this is.
[6417.36 → 6419.64] And I'd like to see if it was successful.
[6420.04 → 6423.24] I don't know if I ever, I don't know.
[6423.40 → 6424.18] It's possible.
[6424.32 → 6424.92] I saw that.
[6425.38 → 6427.14] I don't remember seeing it.
[6427.14 → 6431.10] So maybe it was good, and maybe it was stupid.
[6436.16 → 6439.08] Scrappy DP says, you don't get to make those decisions anymore.
[6439.40 → 6440.22] You are right.
[6440.34 → 6443.06] I mean, I do get to make decisions about which checks I sign.
[6443.18 → 6444.52] I actually do get to make decisions.
[6444.82 → 6444.84] Yeah.
[6444.84 → 6446.84] In that case, that is a that is a yes.
[6446.92 → 6447.10] Yeah.
[6447.56 → 6455.64] Even at the very highest level, and I'm talking Taryn and me, we, we have checks and balances
[6455.64 → 6461.36] for, um, you know, how much you can spend without like talking to somebody, right?
[6461.72 → 6466.06] Like the only person in the company who could spend a literally unlimited amount of money
[6466.06 → 6467.66] without talking to someone is Yvonne.
[6468.62 → 6469.48] And she wouldn't.
[6470.02 → 6470.78] She's so cheap.
[6471.68 → 6476.12] I don't mean cheap in like, uh, like her, uh, her last name kind of way.
[6476.12 → 6485.12] I mean, like, uh, I don't, I mean, like she's frugal.
[6487.58 → 6488.50] Dan quick.
[6488.62 → 6489.24] Change the subject.
[6489.48 → 6489.72] Yeah.
[6490.60 → 6491.08] Okay.
[6491.60 → 6492.42] Yeah, sure.
[6492.84 → 6493.24] Hi, DL.
[6493.40 → 6497.58] How do you go about weighing cost of new systems versus the benefits?
[6497.58 → 6502.30] We have the opportunity to use a fantastic progressive new tool, but there is pressure
[6502.30 → 6504.86] to save money and use a subpar tool.
[6506.88 → 6508.44] Sometimes it can make sense.
[6508.52 → 6509.18] Oh man.
[6509.26 → 6509.92] Was this asking you?
[6509.92 → 6511.14] There are a lot of intangibles though.
[6511.40 → 6511.68] Yeah.
[6512.30 → 6513.50] I don't know what was asked to all of us.
[6513.60 → 6513.86] Okay.
[6514.18 → 6517.20] What I would say is sometimes it can make sense to use the cheaper tool, but something you
[6517.20 → 6521.76] have to measure is like, uh, what loss is there?
[6521.86 → 6524.30] What other loss is there from using the cheaper tool?
[6524.40 → 6525.52] Cause sometimes it's not worth it.
[6525.52 → 6526.98] And losses are not always measurable.
[6526.98 → 6528.66] Like they're not always in terms of money.
[6528.66 → 6533.98] Like you can have, like you can have someone using, you know, an old, uh, five by four,
[6534.50 → 6537.98] 12, 12, 80 by, you know, 10, 24 LCD.
[6537.98 → 6542.16] And they could probably do their job, but are, are they going to like jump at the next opportunity
[6542.16 → 6543.06] to move somewhere else?
[6543.12 → 6547.26] Maybe it's like worth it to just give them a, you know, an ultra-wide, right?
[6547.26 → 6551.78] Like that's, that's such a simple example, but there are so many things that are like that.
[6552.38 → 6555.50] Um, I, I think a lot of the time,
[6555.52 → 6558.82] the best way to answer it is through talking to people.
[6559.10 → 6564.68] Like if a creator warehouse, uh, came to me and said, you know, Hey, uh, we really want
[6564.68 → 6565.44] a lathe.
[6565.84 → 6566.32] Okay.
[6566.50 → 6567.58] I'd be like, okay.
[6568.24 → 6569.96] A lathe is this many dollars.
[6570.12 → 6574.92] If I told you, you can only have this many dollars, would you still spend it on a lathe?
[6575.98 → 6577.72] I can afford this many dollars.
[6577.72 → 6577.98] Sure.
[6577.98 → 6579.28] So that's not the conversation.
[6580.06 → 6582.14] Is there anything else you'd rather have?
[6582.14 → 6585.86] And that would impact your productivity and your happiness more.
[6586.06 → 6587.52] You know, tell me about that.
[6587.60 → 6591.00] Tell me about the pros and cons so we can make a decision together.
[6591.06 → 6595.84] I mean, collaboration and communication is almost always the answer.
[6596.02 → 6602.58] It's just that humans, in spite of our brains being evolutionarily advantaged for those things,
[6602.70 → 6604.50] still kind of suck at it.
[6604.58 → 6606.56] Sometimes you just want to do the lizard thing.
[6606.78 → 6606.98] Yeah.
[6607.12 → 6607.64] Lizard brain.
[6607.74 → 6608.26] Let's go.
[6608.66 → 6608.92] Yeah.
[6608.96 → 6611.68] But I mean, like air to you said, uh, communication collaboration.
[6611.96 → 6613.12] Airtable is a decent example.
[6613.18 → 6614.14] It's not the cheapest option.
[6614.80 → 6615.00] Sure.
[6615.16 → 6618.28] But we're trying to go for it because we think it'll be a very significant improvement.
[6618.50 → 6621.40] I think it will be amounted per user that we're paying.
[6621.50 → 6625.92] I think we'll be easily covered in the like time and issue savings that we'll have from running it.
[6626.02 → 6627.56] So at that point, it's like.
[6628.24 → 6633.96] Whereas the same company might have made a different decision 10 years prior, 10 years prior.
[6633.96 → 6636.42] I would have said, I don't have time to figure this Airtable thing out.
[6636.56 → 6638.00] The very cost.
[6638.16 → 6638.98] There was no way we would have done it.
[6638.98 → 6642.84] The very cost of figuring out how to use it would not even be worth it,
[6642.84 → 6644.56] let alone the ongoing cost of running it.
[6644.64 → 6645.28] Use a Google sheet.
[6645.44 → 6647.32] Especially at the scale that we were at.
[6647.40 → 6647.52] Yeah.
[6647.60 → 6649.46] Like we didn't have the same type of problems.
[6649.58 → 6649.72] Well.
[6650.46 → 6650.68] Well.
[6650.84 → 6651.00] Yeah.
[6651.10 → 6652.68] But to a much smaller degree.
[6653.12 → 6653.26] Yeah.
[6654.16 → 6657.60] Crystal says you technically can make those decisions.
[6657.82 → 6659.70] I technically can't.
[6659.70 → 6661.36] Back to the approval limits.
[6661.98 → 6664.32] I literally don't even know where the chequebook is.
[6665.76 → 6668.58] I would have to talk to someone to know where it is.
[6668.66 → 6669.50] It's not that I couldn't.
[6669.74 → 6672.30] It's not that I couldn't have a conversation with Yvonne and go,
[6672.30 → 6677.08] Hey, I need to be able to spend money at a moment's notice without you knowing anything
[6677.08 → 6677.68] about it.
[6678.64 → 6682.86] I don't think that would like, I think she'd be like, why?
[6683.00 → 6685.26] And that would be, I wouldn't have a good reason for that.
[6685.52 → 6687.66] Especially with the precedent of that never being required.
[6687.98 → 6688.18] Yeah.
[6688.38 → 6688.54] Yeah.
[6690.26 → 6694.38] But no, I literally cannot spend unlimited amounts of money without any,
[6694.54 → 6696.06] without anybody else knowing about it.
[6696.68 → 6697.34] All right.
[6697.34 → 6698.34] Okay.
[6700.02 → 6700.42] Okay.
[6700.64 → 6701.02] Next.
[6701.02 → 6705.98] With the current turbulent, in quotes, economy, what do you think of hardware startups doing
[6705.98 → 6709.60] crowdfunding instead of seeking traditional venture capitalist investment?
[6710.14 → 6714.24] For example, crowdfunding a prosumer version of your product.
[6714.24 → 6722.64] Uh, I think that it's, I mean, it's the same trade-offs that crowdfunding has always brought,
[6722.74 → 6722.94] right?
[6723.20 → 6730.64] You are essentially asking for like venture capital, and you're not giving up any equity.
[6730.64 → 6736.68] So, you know, as from a company standpoint, I totally understand why you want to do that.
[6736.78 → 6739.30] You'd want to do that every time.
[6739.72 → 6747.70] Um, but from a, uh, from a, from a, um, an investor standpoint, I use that term extremely
[6747.70 → 6749.70] loosely because you will not get a return.
[6749.78 → 6750.96] You have not made an investment.
[6751.24 → 6753.82] Uh, there is basically no advantage.
[6753.82 → 6760.78] You are, you are extremely disadvantaged, and you will, you know, maybe get something that
[6760.78 → 6761.78] is really great.
[6761.82 → 6765.62] I'm trying to think of like a, like a Kickstarter that turned out great.
[6765.62 → 6766.24] Like, okay.
[6766.34 → 6771.60] I and Neo did some cool Kickstarter's like way back in the day, or maybe you will get something
[6771.60 → 6777.14] that is like kind of what you thought it would be, but ultimately disappoints like a IBO.
[6777.14 → 6784.56] Uh, or maybe you will get nothing like Luke's coal hammer, and you have no way of knowing.
[6784.68 → 6785.66] So what do I think about it?
[6785.68 → 6790.40] I think you shouldn't buy that, but I totally understand why companies are into it.
[6790.64 → 6791.10] Right.
[6794.52 → 6794.96] Okay.
[6795.06 → 6797.54] Wait, are you asking like if we would do that?
[6798.50 → 6802.74] Oh, EG crowdfunding a prosumer version of your product.
[6804.28 → 6806.56] I could see us crowdfunding something at some point.
[6806.56 → 6811.46] Um, we have, but we wouldn't do it on anything where we don't have an extremely high degree
[6811.46 → 6813.04] of confidence that we can bring it to market.
[6813.04 → 6819.58] And we also are just like funded by our, our daily operations and cashflow.
[6820.06 → 6824.98] So at the end of the day, if it like didn't work out with the money that we raised through
[6824.98 → 6826.78] crowdfunding, we would just push it over the line.
[6826.78 → 6830.32] So, um, I just, I just don't, I don't know.
[6830.54 → 6835.52] I'm not saying I'm not going to say never, but especially given the way that I've advocated
[6835.52 → 6836.72] against pre-ordering.
[6836.84 → 6843.82] I don't see how we could really like a prosumer version of our product.
[6843.92 → 6846.08] Like if it was a variant, I don't know.
[6846.70 → 6850.68] I could, yeah, like I could see us, I could see us crowdfunding like a version of a backpack.
[6850.86 → 6852.14] I was going to say Lux backpack.
[6852.28 → 6852.52] Yeah.
[6852.64 → 6852.94] Yeah.
[6852.94 → 6853.30] Okay.
[6853.30 → 6857.44] There are things where I could see it making sense where there's just, would it be crowdfunding
[6857.44 → 6857.62] though?
[6857.64 → 6859.86] Or would it be like presale almost?
[6860.00 → 6860.20] Yeah.
[6860.20 → 6863.24] But that's what a lot of crowdfunding campaigns are, right?
[6863.30 → 6866.36] Is there essentially just gauging interest?
[6866.50 → 6868.06] So you produce the right number of them.
[6868.06 → 6870.60] So you don't overstock or understock, right?
[6870.96 → 6873.74] Maybe Nvidia should crowdfund their GPUs.
[6873.94 → 6875.58] So they produce enough of them.
[6875.96 → 6877.04] Just an idea.
[6878.32 → 6878.76] Scam.
[6878.76 → 6879.84] All right.
[6880.80 → 6881.82] Let's see what else.
[6881.92 → 6887.56] What's your advice to balance a time-consuming or demanding job, but not sacrificing time
[6887.56 → 6889.62] for family or yourself on a daily basis?
[6889.74 → 6890.82] Set boundaries for your job.
[6891.50 → 6893.30] That's the only, that's the only answer.
[6894.00 → 6897.10] You know, try to waste less time commuting.
[6897.52 → 6898.94] It's really important to me.
[6899.00 → 6903.82] I commuted like almost two hours each way when I was in school.
[6903.82 → 6910.60] And then I commuted like 45 minutes each way when I worked at NCI for the first little
[6910.60 → 6910.86] while.
[6910.90 → 6917.22] And then I think it was down to like 35 once I, once I moved in with Yvonne, but it was
[6917.22 → 6917.84] too much.
[6918.22 → 6922.28] I'm, I'm quite a bit less than that now still feels like too much.
[6922.82 → 6928.66] And as much as it's a huge decision to like move, if you're really secure in your workplace,
[6928.66 → 6933.48] I would say that's one way to gain back time every day is to spend less time commuting.
[6934.72 → 6937.40] You might also be able to talk about like hybrid work.
[6937.54 → 6939.10] Like maybe you can work from home partially.
[6939.22 → 6940.72] That's another way to cut down on your commute.
[6942.62 → 6943.60] Other than that.
[6945.18 → 6946.88] Yeah, that, that, that's about it.
[6946.90 → 6949.54] You're just going to have to, you're just going to have to set boundaries, and you're going
[6949.54 → 6953.86] to have to recognize that setting boundaries may have consequences.
[6953.86 → 6961.10] That you aren't happy with, like depending on your workplace, you may get passed up for
[6961.10 → 6966.20] a promotion for someone who just like puts in 12 hours a day, and you may kind of go, well,
[6966.32 → 6968.00] like, but like, I can't do that.
[6968.66 → 6971.26] And your boss might not care.
[6972.66 → 6974.52] And that just might be what happens.
[6974.58 → 6976.08] And I'm not saying that's right.
[6976.30 → 6978.10] I'm not saying it should be like that.
[6978.18 → 6979.52] I'm not saying that that's fair.
[6979.52 → 6983.66] But it is so.
[6986.16 → 6986.52] Yeah.
[6989.30 → 6989.66] Yeah.
[6989.66 → 6994.44] When looking at places to live, I don't know, especially around here, having some pretty
[6994.44 → 7000.50] fat commutes to be able to get cool places is very attractive until you like to break down
[7000.50 → 7003.70] like, okay, that's how many hours a week am I driving?
[7004.16 → 7005.48] How many hours is that a month?
[7005.60 → 7006.82] How many hours is that a year?
[7006.82 → 7012.44] Or once I've lived here for five years, how many hours of my life to drive my car?
[7013.00 → 7015.54] It's like, dang.
[7017.62 → 7018.10] Yeah.
[7019.40 → 7025.76] Hey, Narcissist Doesn't Know and Dan, love your stuff and your tech video side projects.
[7026.56 → 7029.70] What's the difference between the blank and Labs blank t-shirt?
[7029.92 → 7031.86] I can't figure it out from the product pages.
[7031.86 → 7039.00] One of them is a shirt and one of them is a shirt that we have to sell enough of to register
[7039.00 → 7039.58] our trademark.
[7045.02 → 7045.56] Did we?
[7046.04 → 7046.26] Mm-hmm.
[7046.42 → 7046.74] Nice.
[7047.36 → 7047.58] Yeah.
[7047.82 → 7049.14] I mean, it's a good shirt.
[7049.68 → 7053.18] It just says, it just says Labs in the back.
[7053.32 → 7055.86] Like literally it's not even visible on the outside of the shirt.
[7055.94 → 7056.44] Totally blank.
[7056.44 → 7058.32] I get such a kick out of it.
[7058.46 → 7062.38] I saw another one of these recently when people are like, yeah, I would love to buy your merch,
[7062.48 → 7065.54] but I just don't, you know, I don't like really prominent branding on stuff.
[7065.62 → 7067.32] I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[7067.38 → 7068.24] Like, what even is this?
[7069.00 → 7069.92] What are you talking about?
[7070.00 → 7071.62] Well, this one has them on the back.
[7071.74 → 7072.40] Oh, barely.
[7072.86 → 7073.54] No, it's a lot.
[7073.70 → 7074.32] Oh, never mind.
[7074.40 → 7074.94] That's that one.
[7075.06 → 7075.18] Okay.
[7075.28 → 7076.24] No, no, no, no.
[7076.34 → 7077.44] Yeah, we don't do logos.
[7077.44 → 7079.44] This was unfortunately a very bad example.
[7079.78 → 7080.36] Ignore that.
[7080.48 → 7080.88] Ignore that.
[7081.00 → 7081.46] Okay, fine.
[7081.52 → 7082.84] How about the one I'm wearing then?
[7083.30 → 7083.46] Yeah.
[7083.46 → 7085.44] There's just a little tiny logo there.
[7085.74 → 7091.74] Like, and honestly, most of the most of the shirts that I wear have practically nothing.
[7091.92 → 7097.96] And I mean, we also sell blanks and have, I saw someone complain, not tall ones.
[7098.14 → 7100.98] I saw someone complain that the commuter bag ignored.
[7101.58 → 7102.34] Oh yeah.
[7102.44 → 7104.08] Like that's like super was branded.
[7104.36 → 7106.00] What are you talking about?
[7106.00 → 7110.82] You literally couldn't find a bag on earth that has more subtle branding than our commuter
[7110.82 → 7111.18] backpack.
[7111.70 → 7112.58] Get real.
[7113.46 → 7114.32] All right.
[7114.94 → 7116.06] Hi, three wise guys.
[7116.24 → 7117.86] What's the deal with the RGB shirts?
[7118.04 → 7121.60] I'm an autistic person, and they are the one of the few shirts that I can consistently
[7121.60 → 7122.60] wear all the time.
[7122.72 → 7123.34] I need more.
[7123.42 → 7124.22] They're getting threadbare.
[7124.70 → 7125.32] I don't know.
[7125.38 → 7128.56] You might want to forward this one to the CW team, and maybe they can get an answer.
[7129.96 → 7131.36] I cannot.
[7132.64 → 7134.24] My tall shirts are getting threadbare.
[7134.30 → 7134.60] They're not.
[7134.74 → 7134.98] They're actually.
[7134.98 → 7135.76] Oh, you can't do that.
[7136.68 → 7138.06] They've not checked the box.
[7138.14 → 7139.18] So I will do it manually.
[7139.68 → 7140.92] Oh, okay.
[7140.92 → 7147.28] Linus, would you think of selling your precision bits individually instead of as sets?
[7147.42 → 7148.76] I broke one, and need a replacement.
[7148.76 → 7152.00] Um, yes.
[7152.42 → 7158.08] We've wanted to do individual bits ever since we launched the original screwdriver.
[7158.08 → 7167.62] However, the logistics of maintaining accuracy with little bits, like little bits, uh, is
[7167.62 → 7171.02] really hard, and we haven't gotten there yet.
[7171.22 → 7174.70] We've just had so much more pressing fish to fry.
[7174.70 → 7179.24] I really, really, really want to do it in the meantime, uh, reach out to customer service
[7179.24 → 7182.84] and maybe they can arrange something one off for you, but I, I'm not promising anything.
[7184.20 → 7184.98] All right, Linus.
[7185.06 → 7187.78] I was wondering if you have any background experience with programming.
[7188.58 → 7188.92] Nothing.
[7189.58 → 7189.84] Nope.
[7190.56 → 7191.62] What if you had time?
[7191.62 → 7195.64] Um, well, here's the thing.
[7196.06 → 7197.12] Time equals money.
[7197.66 → 7198.68] I have money.
[7198.88 → 7203.48] So I do have time, but that's other people's time.
[7203.96 → 7206.46] So if I needed something programmed, what would I do?
[7207.40 → 7211.26] I don't have literal time like this kind, but I can buy time.
[7211.26 → 7219.22] Um, I, I remember having this conversation with, uh, um, uh, a buddy of mine who runs another
[7219.22 → 7222.38] badminton centre in the lower mainland, like, like years ago.
[7222.62 → 7226.06] And he was giving me a hard time about like spending way too much on something.
[7226.40 → 7231.02] And he's like, and I'm, and I'm like, look, money.
[7231.12 → 7231.40] Yes.
[7231.54 → 7231.80] Time.
[7231.88 → 7232.10] No.
[7232.70 → 7235.62] So that's why I made the decision I made.
[7235.62 → 7239.42] And then the thing, dude, he says that to me, like every time I see him.
[7239.42 → 7239.70] No.
[7240.54 → 7240.90] Money.
[7241.04 → 7241.12] Yes.
[7241.20 → 7241.32] Time.
[7241.32 → 7241.72] Oh yeah.
[7241.78 → 7242.44] That is you.
[7242.66 → 7242.88] Money.
[7243.00 → 7243.08] Yes.
[7243.12 → 7243.30] Time.
[7243.36 → 7243.58] No.
[7245.52 → 7246.84] Why do I even talk to you?
[7249.84 → 7250.24] Yep.
[7250.88 → 7251.28] Anyway.
[7251.78 → 7252.06] Yes.
[7252.06 → 7253.82] The CEO PC is still deployed.
[7253.88 → 7254.90] Uh, Jacob framework.
[7255.62 → 7256.64] And flow plane chat.
[7256.72 → 7257.34] Of course it is.
[7258.08 → 7258.82] We don't.
[7258.96 → 7259.66] That's the thing.
[7259.70 → 7261.40] I get called a liar all the time.
[7261.40 → 7262.46] It's so weird and chaotic.
[7262.46 → 7266.12] Every time I go into his office, he has this crazy blown up computer.
[7266.28 → 7266.46] Yeah.
[7266.62 → 7267.50] I love it though.
[7267.78 → 7269.24] But we just like, oh wait.
[7269.42 → 7271.08] We didn't talk about honey.
[7271.56 → 7272.46] Says Jack Logan.
[7273.06 → 7274.44] I don't think you're right.
[7274.54 → 7275.76] It never ended up in the dock.
[7275.90 → 7282.14] So one of the co-founders of honey did an AMA this week and basically outlined that mega
[7282.14 → 7288.56] legs video was aside from not being entirely in good faith, which was pretty obvious to
[7288.56 → 7288.94] us.
[7289.50 → 7293.68] Um, and aside from being old news, which was pretty obvious to us.
[7293.68 → 7294.52] That was very true.
[7294.52 → 7298.90] Given that a lot of what he talked about was stuff that had been covered by videos years
[7298.90 → 7299.30] prior.
[7299.44 → 7304.66] So maybe that was what he meant by a multi-year investigation was that someone else had made
[7304.66 → 7307.24] a video about it years ago, and he finally watched it.
[7307.60 → 7310.78] Um, aside from all that, it appears.
[7310.78 → 7316.12] And I, I, I, I, I, I, look, I'm not going to get between them on this.
[7316.50 → 7321.40] Uh, I'm just annoyed that I got dragged into it at all because the whole thing is ridiculous.
[7321.40 → 7329.50] Um, but basically he outlined a very compelling case for how mega leg doesn't appear to have
[7329.50 → 7338.28] been entirely forthright and appears to have gone with a an overly negative conspiratorial,
[7338.28 → 7347.58] um, conclusion that is at best not well-supported by the data that he collected.
[7347.78 → 7349.24] I haven't read this thing at all.
[7349.32 → 7349.72] I have.
[7349.86 → 7350.54] I can't comment.
[7350.54 → 7350.84] Yeah.
[7350.90 → 7351.82] I read the whole thing.
[7352.40 → 7353.96] Um, yeah.
[7354.36 → 7356.48] So cool.
[7356.96 → 7364.04] And really my question is how many times do I have to turn out to not be the asshole for
[7364.04 → 7365.48] that to stop being the narrative?
[7366.70 → 7368.36] It doesn't seem to matter.
[7368.82 → 7371.02] At least at a minimum one more.
[7371.08 → 7372.08] At least once more.
[7372.24 → 7375.42] And then that time it will be at least one more time again.
[7375.44 → 7375.78] What's that?
[7375.82 → 7376.50] What's that reference?
[7376.62 → 7378.64] That's a that's a that's a reference.
[7378.76 → 7379.30] I'm pretty sure.
[7379.40 → 7379.56] Yeah.
[7379.56 → 7386.24] Um, disturbed freak says, Luke, you're looking bored.
[7386.60 → 7387.98] Surely you're not tired already.
[7388.98 → 7391.28] I woke up at like five today.
[7391.64 → 7392.00] Nice.
[7392.26 → 7393.38] But I'll be fine.
[7393.98 → 7394.34] Nice.
[7394.84 → 7398.60] I can't wait to see what happens with all the performative lawsuits about it.
[7398.60 → 7400.28] Yeah.
[7400.44 → 7400.60] Yeah.
[7401.18 → 7401.58] Whatever.
[7402.10 → 7402.42] Yeah.
[7403.16 → 7405.36] And everyone like asking why I'm not saying it.
[7405.36 → 7405.38] Okay.
[7405.44 → 7405.96] I found it.
[7405.96 → 7406.30] Because I'm not.
[7406.66 → 7409.50] Man, it's fascinating how little traction this thing got.
[7409.96 → 7410.54] Oh, I know.
[7410.86 → 7416.30] It's amazing how little traction the it turns out that the explosive allegations weren't
[7416.30 → 7416.60] true.
[7416.94 → 7417.18] Yes.
[7417.18 → 7419.50] It's like amazing.
[7419.50 → 7424.82] The amount of damage that can be done by a bunch of assumptions and how utterly impossible
[7424.82 → 7426.26] it is to undo the damage.
[7427.06 → 7428.16] It's really frustrating.
[7428.16 → 7430.84] I got one more for you here.
[7433.34 → 7434.70] Are you still a comment reading?
[7434.70 → 7439.08] No, it just makes me want to, it just makes me want to actually give some, give people something
[7439.08 → 7439.82] to be angry about.
[7439.94 → 7440.66] Like, what could I do?
[7440.98 → 7441.56] What could I do?
[7441.58 → 7442.46] We could do Linus coin.
[7442.72 → 7443.68] You could do anything.
[7444.54 → 7444.74] Really?
[7444.94 → 7446.12] The AMA guy.
[7446.14 → 7447.28] I took that as permission.
[7448.78 → 7449.22] No.
[7449.28 → 7449.58] Really?
[7449.88 → 7450.20] Anything?
[7450.46 → 7450.74] No.
[7450.92 → 7451.84] People need jobs.
[7453.10 → 7454.14] Especially right now.
[7454.36 → 7456.20] Well, I mean, that would cause outrage.
[7457.30 → 7457.66] What?
[7457.98 → 7459.44] If you just dissolved the company.
[7459.62 → 7460.18] Oh, yeah.
[7460.58 → 7461.46] That would be pretty good.
[7461.52 → 7462.22] That would be a good one.
[7462.34 → 7463.06] That would be excellent.
[7463.30 → 7463.48] Yeah.
[7464.02 → 7464.94] I could do it live.
[7464.94 → 7469.90] I could live stream myself, like, joyfully terminating everyone.
[7470.26 → 7470.54] Wow.
[7470.62 → 7471.56] Like, one at a time.
[7471.66 → 7472.44] You didn't have to add joy.
[7472.54 → 7473.14] Oh, wow.
[7473.14 → 7473.52] Oh, yeah.
[7473.60 → 7476.00] Like, no, I'd have to be, like, enthusiastic about it.
[7476.70 → 7479.66] I think that would pretty much trash my reputation forever.
[7480.28 → 7482.44] Then again, it doesn't, nothing seems to matter anymore.
[7482.44 → 7484.42] Someone out there would be like, that's based.
[7484.50 → 7485.30] That's based, yeah.
[7485.76 → 7488.76] It's like, why is, why is being an asshole cool?
[7488.78 → 7490.70] There will be at least one person on your side.
[7490.70 → 7493.10] Seriously, why is being a dick to people cool?
[7493.64 → 7494.56] It's not.
[7494.72 → 7494.96] Yeah.
[7495.36 → 7499.16] Why do, why do we treat it like it's a good thing?
[7499.26 → 7499.88] It's not.
[7500.22 → 7500.64] I don't know.
[7500.64 → 7504.02] You should, like, be a reasonable human and engage in good faith.
[7504.12 → 7505.26] Negativity is attractive.
[7505.86 → 7506.36] Why?
[7506.88 → 7508.14] I don't know, because we're humans.
[7508.88 → 7512.08] Big ape monkey leader of tribe.
[7512.42 → 7512.52] Oh!
[7512.70 → 7512.88] Oh!
[7513.02 → 7513.20] Oh!
[7513.32 → 7514.10] He said thing!
[7514.28 → 7514.48] Oh!
[7514.70 → 7515.02] Oh!
[7516.16 → 7516.98] There you go.
[7516.98 → 7521.16] Have I said it once this whole stream?
[7521.50 → 7521.78] Yeah.
[7522.60 → 7523.86] But you did it intentionally.
[7524.04 → 7524.68] I don't know.
[7524.78 → 7525.08] I don't know.
[7528.38 → 7529.22] Paying dividends.
[7531.54 → 7532.36] All right, go ahead.
[7532.52 → 7533.10] I haven't used mine.
[7533.16 → 7533.88] I need to use mine more.
[7534.12 → 7534.52] Yeah.
[7534.78 → 7536.64] You should pivot to selling Aries Tech products.
[7536.76 → 7537.64] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7537.64 → 7545.30] If I wanted to make the real money, I think it would probably be in, actually, I probably
[7545.30 → 7546.04] just shouldn't say this.
[7546.10 → 7546.92] It's going to make people mad.
[7547.06 → 7547.52] Okay, go ahead.
[7547.78 → 7552.46] And it's interesting that the Reddit thread for the honey thing was, like, downvoted to
[7552.46 → 7552.82] oblivion.
[7552.90 → 7553.70] It's currently at zero.
[7554.18 → 7554.58] Really?
[7554.74 → 7558.22] But his replies are not.
[7559.58 → 7560.74] It's almost like-
[7560.74 → 7561.84] All the replies are positive.
[7561.84 → 7567.20] It's almost like haters just don't want to have their narrative challenged.
[7567.60 → 7570.34] My question is, I suspect people did't-
[7570.34 → 7573.04] I haven't read it, but I also haven't voted on it.
[7573.78 → 7577.22] But I wonder if people read it or if they just downvoted it.
[7577.24 → 7579.40] Oh, there's no way that they read it and then downvoted it.
[7579.42 → 7583.30] And then maybe the reason why all the comments are being outvoted is you would have to actually
[7583.30 → 7584.32] go in and find them.
[7584.42 → 7584.54] Yep.
[7584.86 → 7585.10] Yeah.
[7585.10 → 7589.80] I guarantee you 100% that that's what happened.
[7589.80 → 7592.64] Because people don't want-
[7592.64 → 7598.20] Because if they brigade and if they were a complete f***ING asshole, they don't want
[7598.20 → 7599.30] to have to face that.
[7599.94 → 7606.18] It's way easier to just go, la la la la la, la la la la la la la, they're bad, they're
[7606.18 → 7609.82] bad, they're bad, downvote, downvote, than to find out what actually happened.
[7610.26 → 7613.20] That's way easier, like, on your psyche.
[7614.64 → 7616.48] So it's just such a coward's way out.
[7617.92 → 7618.80] Anyway, Dan.
[7618.80 → 7621.42] Hey, LLD, love the show, love the products.
[7621.60 → 7624.68] Linus, did you save any of your childhood toys to pass on to your own kids?
[7624.82 → 7628.56] I saved a giant bin of K'next hat my son and I now build together.
[7628.64 → 7629.78] Yeah, I have a couple of things.
[7630.12 → 7638.16] I have a little Galatian, I'm trying to remember what it's called.
[7639.30 → 7640.24] Yeah, I have one of these.
[7640.24 → 7645.46] And my kids played with it, like, a couple of times, but mostly weren't interested because
[7645.46 → 7647.64] my house is also full of better video games.
[7648.96 → 7650.50] I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
[7650.58 → 7655.60] I have a little toy piano that a couple of my kids kind of played with a little bit.
[7655.60 → 7661.24] Oh, oh, I have that weird wrestler dude figure that I sent you that's apparently, someone
[7661.24 → 7664.20] was trying to sell it on Facebook Marketplace for, like, 80 bucks or something, and I was
[7664.20 → 7665.00] like, why really?
[7666.22 → 7666.80] I don't know.
[7666.80 → 7667.86] That's Stretch guy, right?
[7667.96 → 7669.28] No, no, no, it wasn't Stretch Armstrong.
[7669.50 → 7671.00] It was just, like, a weird wrestler figure.
[7671.02 → 7671.36] Oh, right.
[7671.42 → 7671.94] No, I remember that.
[7671.94 → 7673.84] Some 80s guy in a Speed.
[7673.84 → 7675.64] I mean, they look similar, so.
[7675.70 → 7676.38] Yeah, exactly.
[7677.22 → 7678.40] Dude, I wish I had a Stretch Armstrong.
[7678.60 → 7679.94] Those things were worth money at one point.
[7680.18 → 7680.44] Yeah.
[7680.74 → 7687.34] Mostly, I don't, I lost almost all my, like, kid, kid childhood stuff when I moved from
[7687.34 → 7690.38] my dad's to my mom's, including my Super Nintendo and all my games.
[7690.52 → 7694.84] Like, I just, I just, like, grabbed the clothes on my back and, like, left.
[7696.22 → 7699.44] So, I have almost nothing from before that.
[7699.44 → 7708.06] And then, like, after that, I was mostly into video games and computers, and I'm not super
[7708.06 → 7710.86] sentimental about most of that stuff.
[7710.94 → 7713.44] So, I haven't really, I haven't really, like, held on to any of it.
[7713.50 → 7715.64] I've, I've reacquired some stuff.
[7715.78 → 7720.96] Like, I, I reacquired the Top Gun joystick that I spent all those hours and hours and hours
[7720.96 → 7724.32] playing Top, playing TIE Fighter with before I moved.
[7724.36 → 7725.94] But that's, it's not my original one.
[7726.04 → 7727.44] It's, it's, it's a reacquisition.
[7728.16 → 7728.44] Yeah.
[7729.44 → 7741.62] Brandon M. asks, Evil Man and the Saints, have you guys ever considered branching into
[7741.62 → 7742.92] electronic toddler toys?
[7743.30 → 7747.62] I'd love to see an LTT gaming PC akin to a Leapfrog or one of those overtly kiddie controllers.
[7748.18 → 7748.96] Um, no.
[7750.00 → 7755.42] I can tell you right now, kids' products are a ton of work.
[7755.42 → 7758.26] There's a ton of regulatory hoops to jump through in terms of value.
[7758.26 → 7760.36] You have to validate every paint that goes on it.
[7760.40 → 7761.50] You have to do this, you have to do that.
[7761.86 → 7764.30] Uh, getting the shape sorter to market was a nightmare.
[7764.44 → 7767.74] I'm not sure if we could ever have any hope of making money on it with all the time and money
[7767.74 → 7769.34] that we spent validating that stupid thing.
[7769.86 → 7775.32] Um, and then, on the flip side, anything with electronics in it...
[7775.32 → 7777.84] Oh, actually, I think it's the wireless communication that's the holdup.
[7777.84 → 7788.24] So, have you seen that little, um, like, kind of rubber, um, old school CRT with a tower under it thing that has, like, a screen in the front?
[7788.38 → 7788.82] Yeah, I think so.
[7788.84 → 7789.48] And it's a lamp.
[7789.90 → 7790.24] Yes.
[7790.32 → 7795.02] And you can book the top of it, and it changes the colour and stuff, and you can, like, communicate with it wirelessly.
[7795.02 → 7797.76] Basically, that's been in purgatory for, like, a year.
[7798.74 → 7801.56] So, anything electronics, a bunch of hurdles.
[7801.90 → 7803.52] Anything kids, a bunch of hurdles.
[7804.30 → 7805.72] Oh, we ain't combining them.
[7805.92 → 7806.54] No time soon.
[7806.72 → 7807.30] No time soon.
[7808.38 → 7810.48] And, yes, that is evil.
[7810.82 → 7813.56] That is my devious plan to not make any kids' electronics.
[7814.36 → 7814.84] Very good.
[7817.64 → 7818.70] No, that's just who he is.
[7818.82 → 7820.34] Anyway, we'll see you again next week.
[7820.54 → 7821.92] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[7822.12 → 7822.88] Or not, I don't know.
[7822.88 → 7823.56] Bye!
[7828.10 → 7829.48] Alright, time to go game.
