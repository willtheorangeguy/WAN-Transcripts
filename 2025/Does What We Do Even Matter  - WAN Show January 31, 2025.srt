[0.00 → 4.48] What's up everyone? Welcome to the LAN show!
[4.72 → 6.22] I told you I was starting the thing.
[6.34 → 8.64] We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[8.84 → 9.06] I ignored you.
[9.56 → 12.50] DeepSeek has been causing deep panic.
[13.04 → 14.32] NVIDIA's stock is down.
[14.46 → 15.38] That was my topic.
[15.42 → 18.94] Last time I looked at it, it was like 11%, which sounds like a lot.
[19.62 → 24.70] Until you consider that NVIDIA's worth like 2 to 3 trillion dollars.
[24.82 → 25.64] Then you know it's a lot.
[25.68 → 26.34] Then you know it.
[26.84 → 28.02] Take the punchline.
[28.02 → 29.40] Anyway, the point is...
[29.40 → 29.76] Got him!
[30.00 → 31.62] We're also going to be talking about...
[31.62 → 34.82] Are hardware reviewers just kind of shouting into the void?
[35.28 → 38.46] Like the percentage of gamers that are actually watching reviews.
[38.84 → 40.20] Is it significant?
[40.42 → 41.36] What else we got this week?
[41.48 → 45.28] You can poison AI in even more fun and creative ways now.
[45.50 → 50.96] And Sony removed PSN requirements for 4 PC games.
[51.06 → 54.88] I think we talked about them adding PSN requirements for...
[54.88 → 56.32] Hell divers.
[56.32 → 58.74] Hell divers and maybe Horizon Zero Dawn?
[58.92 → 59.06] Maybe?
[59.06 → 59.12] Maybe?
[59.30 → 60.68] But they did it for Spider-Man 2.
[60.76 → 61.34] Last of Us 2.
[61.56 → 63.22] You know we do the topic later, right?
[63.58 → 64.70] We could have talked about it right now.
[65.02 → 65.68] It's pretty short.
[65.96 → 66.20] Yeah.
[66.30 → 66.88] We'll have to find.
[66.96 → 68.16] But we're not going to.
[68.20 → 68.82] But we have to...
[68.82 → 69.52] We have to...
[69.52 → 70.70] Drag them on.
[73.68 → 74.74] Make them keep watching.
[74.74 → 89.64] The show today is brought to you by Pesci.
[89.64 → 98.04] Odom and odd pieces also by our rap partner brand and our chair partner secret lab why don't we jump
[98.04 → 104.88] straight into our what's the title today what is our headline topic oh does what we do even matter
[104.88 → 112.00] this was actually inspired by a really cool visual that Paul's hardware created that was awesome
[112.00 → 120.60] showing how the 5080 kind of blows compared to previous generational uplifts from 80 class cards
[120.60 → 128.30] now our review wasn't exactly glowing either we pretty much pointed out that it's a bit better
[128.30 → 135.14] but if this doesn't beat a 4090 the uh upcoming 5070 contrary to what NVIDIA has been claiming
[135.14 → 144.28] absolutely will not beat a 4090 but the question that looking at Paul's graphs and looking at the
[144.28 → 150.66] at the viewer retention for our 5080 review and not just ours but 5080 reviews around the
[150.66 → 157.28] internet the question that it raised in my mind was does what we're doing even make a difference
[157.28 → 165.02] and I'm not trying to be defeatist here or anything but the 5090 literally sold out
[165.02 → 170.78] in seconds well there was like none of them literally instantaneously this is a two thousand
[170.78 → 176.78] four of anything it's going to sell pretty quick this is a two thousand dollar this is a two thousand
[176.78 → 184.46] dollar GPU and then the 5080 apparently bots scalped the entire stock for multiple EU countries before
[184.46 → 191.26] the official launch thanks to a leaked distributor link after signing a total 5090 at micro centre
[191.26 → 200.90] jay's two cents found the thing listed on marketplace for 5800 later that day which I find disgusting
[200.90 → 208.76] they had an opportunity to price it at 5080 dollars, and they went for 5800 dollars
[208.76 → 217.08] that's outrageous that is outrageous it is joke either way is outrageous please for the love of god
[217.08 → 226.20] slash s um nope you're serious and here is a hilarious post that is now gone from r slash pc Mr oh it was
[226.20 → 233.88] up before the show justifying scalping um oh but I'm not bad because I only scalped one card
[233.88 → 242.46] so here's the thing scalpers are clearly getting utterly detached from reality amounts of money for
[242.46 → 247.26] these things because they wouldn't price these things so high if nobody was buying them NVIDIA
[247.26 → 253.74] clearly has zero incentive whatsoever to lower pricing we talked about this in our recent video
[253.74 → 260.96] is now a good time to buy a pc right we talked about how what happened the last time around that we had a
[260.96 → 268.74] huge spike in pricing was the dominant player in the market and that's NVIDIA noticed that oh people will
[268.74 → 275.48] totally pay that much for this stuff, but they'll keep the prices high whether we're paying tariffs or
[275.48 → 282.28] whether there is you know cove inflation or whatever the case may be if people will pay it that's what
[282.28 → 287.62] the market will bear and that's going to make our shareholders real happy no competition um
[287.62 → 296.96] and so I'm looking at it going we spend how many person hours do you think went into
[296.96 → 302.92] something like our 5090 and 5080 reviews and i I'm combining them because a lot of the work was
[302.92 → 308.44] somewhat overlapping uh because we used it was the same driver release from NVIDIA for both cards
[308.44 → 313.84] um a lot of the testing for 5080 review was done on the 5090 review and then stuff like that
[313.84 → 320.02] it completely dominated the output from the labs from the testers and nick and some other people
[320.02 → 329.12] being involved for uh probably a solid like two three weeks yeah, and then we had one writer dedicated
[329.12 → 335.92] to it for a couple of weeks probably more like two and a half and then there's the know we went to
[335.92 → 341.58] CES largely for information that informed that oh yeah that's true so I think that counts I mean it would
[341.58 → 346.98] it is fair for me to say that there are hundreds of hours oh easily in those reviews easily so
[346.98 → 356.08] we say hey this thing is not really that worth it is sells out immediately people pay scalper prices
[356.08 → 362.24] for them and here's where this thought here's where this thought train kind of led to i was looking at
[362.24 → 367.94] the numbers the number of views on our reviews for these cards and not just ours um but also from
[367.94 → 376.98] from other reviewers around the web and I would say that looking at the 5080 and the 5090 the tam so
[376.98 → 383.86] the total addressable market that the total number of people that actually watch a hardware review video
[383.86 → 390.96] for a GPU is probably somewhere between the Lamborghini of the GPUs either way which tends to
[390.96 → 396.32] get more views no we sure oh yeah yeah yeah sure because we get way fewer views on the cards that
[396.32 → 402.46] people buy more actually yes yeah so even for the best case scenario the tam is probably somewhere
[402.46 → 410.26] between four and six million people because there's a lot of crosstalk people watch more than one video
[410.26 → 415.26] there'll be a ton of overlap because we aren't the only ones who for years have said hey don't just
[415.26 → 420.28] take one reviews word for it go watch all of them yeah you could go watch more so that you can get
[420.28 → 424.56] multiple perspectives because everyone's going to have some slightly different ideas about what they think
[424.56 → 431.36] is important and I will say as kind of expected this generation was like one of the best examples
[431.36 → 437.62] of that yeah uh there were a lot of different uh outlets that took different angles on this I mean
[437.62 → 443.90] you pointed out Paul's earlier if I remember correctly um hardware Canucks did a like let's see
[443.90 → 448.12] it gets CPU throttled by using older and older yeah use different things like that's been kind of
[448.12 → 453.50] different approaches which I thought was really cool awesome um so yeah this was this generation
[453.50 → 457.56] proved our point better than like literally ever before so if you have only looked at one go look
[457.56 → 464.18] at more so here's my problem with that if the tam for people in these quite overlapping circles right
[464.18 → 469.02] who watch hardware reviews is somewhere in that lets let's say for the sake of argument that I'm
[469.02 → 475.50] totally off, and it's like 10 million let's let's say it's way more sure the total number okay it almost
[475.50 → 482.08] certainly is because of other languages and stuff sure that's fine the total number of pc gamers
[482.08 → 488.84] is estimated to be somewhere between one and two billion yeah so like it doesn't even matter if it's
[488.84 → 494.96] six or ten and and and i I want to make sure that we're we're giving this kind of balanced
[494.96 → 500.14] discussion right because I think there's a strong argument to be made for micro influence like micro
[500.14 → 506.14] influencers people who influence their family and friends they might stay up on everything
[506.14 → 510.18] and you watch all the reviews and everything like that and their friends might not, but they might get
[510.18 → 514.88] the benefit of those recommendations but even than so like the market is probably like three to
[514.88 → 521.12] four x the amount of people that watch the video even then what's clear to me from these numbers is that
[521.12 → 529.88] the vast majority of people who buy a GPU who buy a gaming pc do not read a review and
[529.88 → 540.62] not only that but even out of the people who do I couldn't help noticing that Erin Mr who's the boss
[540.62 → 546.34] actually has the highest performing 5090 video by a decent amount by a fairly significant margin
[546.34 → 552.98] and if you want to if you want to sort of I think it's his fit if you want to reflect on you know what
[552.98 → 560.36] the difference is right I think it's pretty clear he's got a lot of energy his style is so good it's so
[560.36 → 567.78] engaging and I think and I think this one is really key it's light on graphs oh yeah there's like barely any
[567.78 → 574.66] have you looked Luke have you looked at the retention on our 5090 video no okay check this out
[574.66 → 583.58] and you know what in fairness this is a thick video we called it RTX 5090 review our b RTX 5090
[583.58 → 590.98] our biggest review ever so check this out of the people those millions of people that do
[590.98 → 597.88] watch a review this is how many of them actually watch the whole thing so we had below average
[597.88 → 604.26] retention oh way below so the people who actually reached the conclusion who reached the
[604.26 → 614.38] sponsor Segway is one third of them most people didn't get past 1440p and 4k raster
[614.38 → 621.16] we're below 50 by the time we get to Blackwell architecture and neural rendering
[621.16 → 628.72] is this a situation where like we should offload more stuff to the site
[628.72 → 635.58] i i i I'm I'm not even asking what's actionable yet yeah I'm mostly just asking I think it's
[635.58 → 643.58] something to consider I'm just asking are we just are we just shouting into the void here's an argument
[643.58 → 648.04] yeah no i I want to I want to have a conversation I want to have a conversation about this because
[648.04 → 650.32] this is this has definitely been
[650.32 → 652.64] enlightening
[652.64 → 658.94] distressing are you part of the problem maybe I'm going to give it the spiciest possible intro maybe
[658.94 → 663.00] my reason hit me my reason come at me, you've already stated you're getting a 5090
[663.00 → 668.80] how many people out there it doesn't even matter how connected to the tech industry they are
[668.80 → 674.24] it doesn't matter it's irrelevant they have a certain current graphics card they were going to buy
[674.24 → 678.84] this completely regardless they might be interested in the performance they might be going and buying a
[678.84 → 684.48] 5090 but being like I like wish it was better, but they're going to do it anyway but like to let me put
[684.48 → 693.58] it this way we are getting deep into the answer to that question oh in our 8k gaming video oh so MSI
[693.58 → 699.56] uh wanted some sponsored 5090 stuff so they could show off their 5090, and we were like
[699.56 → 702.78] let's game at 8k again
[702.78 → 709.54] so we're so we're milking that stupid 8k TV in the lounge beautiful, and we're gaming at 8k
[709.54 → 719.20] again and what adds really a fascinating through line to that video is that both of the
[719.20 → 727.80] hosts me and nick proof had declared during the rumour phase that we were going to buy a 5090
[727.80 → 737.54] so the card our before card that we compare the 5090 to is literally nick proof's 4090
[737.54 → 743.50] that he had to pull out of his computer at home because we wanted to have a MSI 4090 and we
[743.50 → 748.86] didn't have one in our inventory and I'm not going to go buy a 4090 right now so he graciously
[748.86 → 756.02] volunteered to bring his 4090 to work so that we could use it for the video and so that he could
[756.02 → 762.82] also experience side by side what kind of upgrade am I getting it's a really cool video
[762.82 → 767.46] and what I will say is that the answer is
[767.46 → 777.92] not a foregone conclusion I said before that I would buy a 5090 so did nick proof when we saw the
[777.92 → 785.94] review numbers both of us felt pretty differently about it yeah, and we did not gain perfect
[785.94 → 792.14] clarity from gaming on them side by side I will say all of those things very interesting that video
[792.14 → 796.14] that video is coming i also I don't want to jump us off this topic yet but for sure like a little
[796.14 → 803.36] bit of a hint to the next topic I also think with the deep seek r1 stuff going on right now um
[803.36 → 810.90] local LLM is exploding like never before um like yes people have been running lamb and stuff for a
[810.90 → 816.44] long time, and we'll get into this are you doing another victory lap right now oh so much I know
[816.44 → 823.84] no idea dude like he is actually erect under the table right now just from how right solid from how
[823.84 → 829.08] right he has been like can you tell that the table is actually tilted slightly slanted yeah yeah
[829.08 → 836.72] yeah yeah because he wasn't, he called it so hard that the cloud was coming to that the cloud
[836.72 → 842.72] was coming back on prem now in fairness I did not make as comprehensive a prediction as you
[842.72 → 849.84] but I resisted the move to the cloud which I think you remember and do you remember everyone calling me
[849.84 → 855.66] stupid for doing on-prem storage yeah oh yeah like for years and years why are you such an idiot why are
[855.66 → 859.74] you doing on-prem storage like all the video people are doing it yeah because it's freaking
[859.74 → 864.94] expensive to put things in the cloud and annoying but what he called was all to compute coming back
[864.94 → 871.28] all the hosted services coming back I didn't i did not see that coming a lot of people told me
[871.28 → 874.44] no when I said it but I was like I don't know I just feel like it's going to be I don't remember what
[874.44 → 879.36] I said by that time you might have been right about so many trends already that I might have just been
[879.36 → 883.32] like I don't think it was a great debate I think we were just kind of like talking about it but there
[883.32 → 887.54] there were a few other people that were like no dude like open eyes gonna push so hard to keep
[887.54 → 893.60] everything yeah and like looking at how llama's been going I never lost hope but I was still like
[893.60 → 899.94] hmm this is not hitting mainstream really uh but I guess we can just shift topics now if you want
[899.94 → 904.84] yeah sure I don't think there's that much more to say about are we wasting our time reviewing GPUs
[904.84 → 909.70] when they get snapped up regardless of what reviewers think of them yeah i think genuinely there is
[909.70 → 916.06] potentially an argument to start talking about like okay what if we give like an overall 1080p
[916.06 → 922.94] gaming average chart in the video, and then we do a breakdown of the games on the site no
[922.94 → 928.88] I don't know I mean like the thing is people are dipping because of graphs like I feel like we
[928.88 → 932.76] might want to respond to that and that doesn't mean the information can't be out there if it's one
[932.76 → 937.42] click away okay that doesn't feel like it's too bad let me present this data differently
[937.42 → 944.08] okay, okay one million people watched the whole thing
[944.08 → 953.54] just about and I think that that's really important those one million people might go tell
[953.54 → 957.30] three friends or five friends and if you take the gaming charts out you might just lose a different
[957.30 → 964.50] portion of people I think so okay I think so I think that I mean look labs is one of those things that
[964.50 → 973.36] we did not create to make money oh yeah that is like the the narrative that you know
[973.36 → 978.50] everything we do is to make the maximum amount of money is just comically false um if I wanted to
[978.50 → 984.60] make more money I would do more sponsored showcase videos and I would do absolutely zero building of a
[984.60 → 992.04] lab um Luke knows because he's seen the numbers but I would literally be millions of dollars more wealthy
[992.04 → 998.34] if I had just not bothered a lot of people think that's hardware cost I'm like it is sure
[998.34 → 1009.22] yeah that too yeah but hardware space but no, no people and uh um so why do we do it we don't do it
[1009.22 → 1017.56] because everyone watches the whole video yeah we do it because it's important yeah yeah um but yeah okay
[1017.56 → 1021.54] so we can jump to this yeah we can jump to the next I'm going to run through some of the notes
[1021.54 → 1026.26] that were written, and then we have like the discussion question section for this discussion
[1026.26 → 1029.82] topic whatever you want to call it is like over half the topic so we'll get into that but I'll
[1029.82 → 1035.16] read the notes first on monday, January 17th several big tech companies stock markets crashed stocks
[1035.16 → 1040.96] crashed not markets uh anyway the market crashed and most of that was big tech companies
[1040.96 → 1049.00] uh most notably was NVIDIA dropping 17 which is roughly 600 billion dollars in market cap
[1049.00 → 1054.02] uh the cause was new AI models developed by Chinese company deep seek that reportedly cost
[1054.02 → 1059.06] less than six million us dollars to train reportedly is a decently important word there yes it is
[1059.06 → 1063.70] obviously some analysts became skeptical of this number, but others said that even if it cost several
[1063.70 → 1069.14] times that amount it would still be far cheaper to run than current competitors like ChatGPT from
[1069.14 → 1074.24] open AI and that seems to probably be true, and it's worth noting that we're talking specifically
[1074.24 → 1082.82] about chat GPR open AI's most recent uh, uh reasoning model yes right we're not talking about any like
[1082.82 → 1087.40] older stuff we're talking about cutting models right now yeah it's kind of it's what matters now
[1087.40 → 1093.14] um speaking of open AI U.S. administration's new AI and crypto czar David Sacks stated that there's
[1093.14 → 1098.10] substantial evidence that what deep seek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of open AI's models
[1098.10 → 1105.32] uh and I don't think open AI is very happy about this what reaping what you sow that's crazy um dude
[1105.32 → 1110.58] that's not in the quote um this okay sorry, sorry could yeah keep reading the thing because this is so
[1110.58 → 1115.44] funny this is generally this is actually the funniest thing that will happen on the land show
[1115.44 → 1122.36] for probably the entire year is open AI being like well you trained it on our data you can't train
[1122.36 → 1129.30] you can't train your AI on our stuff it's the Spider-Man meme uh what are you even talking about
[1129.30 → 1135.48] buddy apparently that's unverified apparently that's unverified open AI is accusing deep seek of
[1135.48 → 1140.48] training deep seek's data set using responses generated by open AI models open AI is now looking
[1140.48 → 1146.42] into countermeasures to protect themselves to help prevent distillation and of course their own IP and
[1146.42 → 1152.20] brand, and then we get into the discussion topics what do you think gives open AI the right to be
[1152.20 → 1157.18] upset about their quote-unquote copyrighted material if all they did was scrape the internet for
[1157.18 → 1162.16] possibly copyrighted material also it's definitely copyrighted material now in fairness they did
[1162.16 → 1171.26] license some of the material way later whenever they got in trouble enough to deal with yes um do you
[1171.26 → 1177.02] do have we like noticed AI scraper bots like on our forum and stuff like is it a lot is it basically
[1177.02 → 1182.36] everything and everyone uh I don't know about float planes so much but all of our other websites
[1182.36 → 1190.72] yeah cool cool cool yeah it's a thing um it's just I talked to um dan Siegel about this
[1190.72 → 1196.70] um the guy that runs the labs web team, and we essentially came to the conclusion of like we can
[1196.70 → 1201.24] spend time and resources on stopping it, or we can spend time and resources on making this
[1201.24 → 1204.86] site better yeah let's do the second thing well let's make the site better yeah let's do the
[1204.86 → 1210.32] second thing yeah um so that's what we're doing um at a certain point like it is what it is it's
[1210.32 → 1215.10] going to be a continued arms race so we would be signing up for like a long-term battle, and it's
[1215.10 → 1222.08] just like man add dub asks how do you notice scraper bots it's a good question that is a good
[1222.08 → 1225.32] question I'm not going to be able to answer super well, but usually it's like you can tell what
[1225.32 → 1231.36] they're doing they don't they're they're searching every single page they're acting in non-human ways
[1231.36 → 1237.96] sometimes they'll even basically flag themselves uh that's not as common um yeah people are posting
[1237.96 → 1243.78] resource usage location yeah that's all very good um there 's's like a ton of different ways
[1243.78 → 1250.12] um Cloudflare have decent scrapers built in I think you mean like scraper defence um they do have
[1250.12 → 1257.82] that um but as far as my understanding goes um like if you try to block this might be false
[1257.82 → 1261.98] I want to say that before I say this as far as my understanding goes if you try to block like
[1261.98 → 1272.22] google's AI scraper bot you'll get deranged so do you want to not be found by anyone including bots
[1272.22 → 1277.72] it's like that it's not really the goal either um so I don't know but either way it's like it hasn't
[1277.72 → 1283.58] even been worth the cycles to figure it out have you like have you played around with deep seek
[1283.58 → 1289.36] yet no not personally but I've seen its outputs a lot, and we're it seems like there's been some
[1289.36 → 1295.12] pretty funny stuff going on some hilarious stuff I don't know if it's been like made up I don't know
[1295.12 → 1301.44] if they're then let's not bother with videos yeah um but yeah we're looking into I am essentially as
[1301.44 → 1306.26] of now declaring like all right I think it's been far enough nick from the lab has been messing around
[1306.26 → 1312.96] with um local LMS on I think it's a Mac mini in the lab for a long time now um, but now it's
[1312.96 → 1316.82] getting to the point where like okay I think we want company right company-wide resources for this
[1316.82 → 1323.04] um so we're probably going to build something which will be cool oh I'm thinking about making
[1323.04 → 1329.74] a video for it okay cool Elijah has in the notes here that uh he's never had anyone reach out
[1329.74 → 1335.22] this is all me oh this is you okay well do your thing then from here to here is all me okay yeah
[1335.22 → 1340.00] I'll just I'll just run for it uh yeah I said while it might still not be mainstream I'd originally
[1340.00 → 1346.90] written like oh local km is mainstream now okay maybe not um and lama has been awesome but nothing
[1346.90 → 1351.68] has brought local km in my opinion to the masses like deep seek a lot of the conversation that I'm
[1351.68 → 1358.10] seeing around deep seek is people like concerned about its ties to China or whatever the other half of
[1358.10 → 1362.76] the conversation has been how incredibly lightweight it is I mean even the chat's blowing up about it
[1362.76 → 1368.06] someone was saying that uh it's been tuned down to require only like 80 gigs of shared memory or
[1368.06 → 1375.80] something like that yeah which is huge which is well not huge no I mean it's a huge deal yeah um
[1375.80 → 1382.40] it's its it's wild it's way easier to run locally and I think a lot of people are seeing the
[1382.40 → 1387.32] benefits especially when you're looking at ChatGPT costs and going like that's 200 dollars
[1387.32 → 1393.84] and m white says bro I managed to get the 8-bit quantized version to run on my 3080 ti
[1393.84 → 1398.92] yeah like oh I have a note in here about 3 000 series graphics cards being like huge for this
[1398.92 → 1403.92] but we'll get to that um yeah anyway sorry I'll just keep going then we can discuss for a little
[1403.92 → 1408.66] bit um, but yeah people are worried about its ties to China or whatever, but you can fairly easily just
[1408.66 → 1414.32] like ignore those by running it locally and even entirely offline um so you don't have to use their
[1414.32 → 1418.80] chatbot thing you can run it locally you can run it entirely offline so they aren't getting reports
[1418.80 → 1424.72] or data from it or anything um and I've heard from many other people that you can tune it so people
[1424.72 → 1429.12] have found that it'll censor certain responses that you might expect a piece of software from China to
[1429.12 → 1434.78] censor uh, but you can just make it not wow you're running it locally you're in control so like
[1434.78 → 1440.24] cool okay i I don't know that you're gonna all get away from all of its potential biases
[1440.24 → 1444.96] to be super clear, but it's open source someone in full plane chat just pointed out you can fork it
[1444.96 → 1451.58] like the fact that this is open source is the craziest part the fact that so much of
[1451.58 → 1458.80] this stuff lama now deep seek is all going open source is wild and yeah I don't know anyway um
[1458.80 → 1465.26] my next note is that I've never had anyone reach out asking about how to run alms locally or what
[1465.26 → 1471.70] hardware to get or anything in the last week I've had no less than 10. I saw a thread on Twitter where
[1471.70 → 1478.44] some someone put together um just like a hardware list with like a couple epic CPUs they were like
[1478.44 → 1483.10] look you don't even like need GPUs because that'll be way more expensive so we're just going to use system
[1483.10 → 1487.00] memory we're going to use CPU uh here's the motherboard you need, they put together this hardware
[1487.00 → 1491.70] list that was yeah sure it's still thousands and thousands of dollars or whatever but compared
[1491.70 → 1495.02] to what you would have needed before to do it on a GPU
[1495.02 → 1503.18] you can even do it so much cheaper than that yeah no, but this was, but this was earlier in
[1503.18 → 1508.98] the week before anyone knew how uh how much it could be optimized for smaller memory footprints so
[1508.98 → 1514.38] it needed like a bunch of ram but anyway the point is not any of that the point is that this post
[1514.38 → 1519.54] had like tens of thousands of upvotes yeah like this is happening like the the the there's a
[1519.54 → 1526.72] shift this is such a niche topic, or it isn't yeah not really anymore and the fact that you can plug and
[1526.72 → 1530.78] play with different models once you get it locally means it's not really going to go out of
[1530.78 → 1535.78] date um it seems like they're getting easier to run not harder, and you're looking at a 200 a month
[1535.78 → 1540.96] bill and going wow I can really distill this out in like half a year, and then it's its gravy from
[1540.96 → 1547.66] there is crazy yeah compared to buying a subscription to like uh like is open AI just gonna
[1547.66 → 1552.44] go out of business no I don't think so and i have a note about that later on yeah let's talk
[1552.44 → 1557.58] about okay someone in full point chat pointed out apparently there are 6400 forks already on GitHub
[1557.58 → 1566.44] so like yeah the whole like oh ties to China stuff I don't think it matters this really to me feels
[1566.44 → 1572.04] like an economic blow it feels like an attack against not just open AI but honestly the entire
[1572.04 → 1577.28] American tech sector the fact that they made the chatbot free, and they completely open sourced it
[1577.28 → 1583.18] so you can't even pull the china card very well I don't see a reason to do that other than to just
[1583.18 → 1590.06] hyper dunk on the American tech industry um anyway I'm going to keep going oh yeah I've never had people
[1590.06 → 1595.98] ask before I had no less than 10 in the last week and I've had people telling me like hey sorry to ask
[1595.98 → 1600.28] what I'm asking on behalf of like another friend that is really interested in I'm wondering if you
[1600.28 → 1606.12] know uh I am personally trying to pressure Wendell to make a video on this so that I can just link it
[1606.12 → 1610.52] to people because I want to stop writing the same thing over and over again then he's going to know
[1610.52 → 1617.38] better than me anyway um, and he said something along the lines of like soon TM I think um that seems
[1617.38 → 1620.90] like the kind of thing Wendell would do yeah so hopefully he does it but I don't know when
[1620.90 → 1625.66] and I'm not saying he's going to but yeah what i have in here is what I will say is what's
[1625.66 → 1632.98] really popular right now is mac minis because of the shared memory yeah so mac studio as well
[1632.98 → 1638.48] because that one you can configure with way more ram nice, and it don't need a crazy amount though
[1638.48 → 1645.38] well the Mac mini with the m4 pro even okay so with the m4 it tops out at 32 gigs that's pretty good
[1645.38 → 1653.06] with the m4 pro it tops out at 64, but the mac studio is honestly not that unreasonably priced
[1653.06 → 1660.14] compared to the mini if as soon once you start to upgrade it, and it maxes out i I believe 192 gigs
[1660.14 → 1666.90] I mean that's sick i just it's so much more than what that's basically everyone needs I'm not
[1666.90 → 1672.52] my main point here is that you can go as low as something like that like I've seen a lot of
[1672.52 → 1679.36] people being like oh I'm going to get 340 90s and like I'm like bro like no and NVIDIA's little
[1679.36 → 1685.96] AI supercomputer for five grand or whatever digits is gonna look completely irrelevant compared to a
[1685.96 → 1692.56] Mac mini if we don't if we don't need all that ram if we don't need a powerful GPU we'll have to see
[1692.56 → 1698.04] how good digits is but yeah for the vast majority of people that aren't running this for like a group
[1698.04 → 1704.40] or a team of people you've run one person I really think like the Mac mini keep it cheap play if
[1704.40 → 1710.00] you're going for one person is not bad I would also want to point out um that 3 000 series GPUs
[1710.00 → 1716.32] are in an in my opinion really cool sweet spot um and on all of this Dan I'm interested in your input
[1716.32 → 1722.64] too maybe when I get through my notes yeah Dan you need to sell those 30 90s no oh well if you just
[1722.64 → 1728.70] want the cash yeah they're worth a lot right now dude 39 because of the 24 gigs of VRAM so yeah my
[1728.70 → 1735.18] next note I bought them uh, uh 39 3 000 series GPUs especially the 30 90 due to its 24 gigs of VRAM
[1735.18 → 1740.90] which didn't increase with the 40 90 and while it did increase with the 50 90 it wasn't by a huge amount
[1740.90 → 1748.20] and those like don't exist so 30 90s are selling now for still over a thousand dollars when did they
[1748.20 → 1752.86] first come out so you know what's funny I think over four years ago and what was the I believe it's
[1752.86 → 1759.98] almost five years ago, so the starting was 1200 us dollars, and it came out in September 24th of 2020
[1759.98 → 1770.48] yeah like holy crap, but they have 24 gigs of VRAM you know what's hilarious is i kind of mocked
[1770.48 → 1776.32] Jensen's keynote when he said that buying that 40 90 was a great investment
[1776.32 → 1785.46] I mean the 30 90 might have been no, no 40 90s have held their value incredibly well oh yeah even
[1785.46 → 1791.40] though the 50 90 and 50 80 have been announced released benchmarked everything proof was telling
[1791.40 → 1798.06] me that he can still get about 2 000 Canadian dollars for his 40 90 that's wild and this is a
[1798.06 → 1804.38] card that the 50 90s don't exist, and so he's been he's been gaming on it for two years so if you
[1804.38 → 1811.92] compare that right like if you could buy if you could buy a car today for 10 000 drive it for two
[1811.92 → 1821.42] years and then sell it for 9 500 then basically you were paying like 40 bucks a month in rent or whatever
[1821.42 → 1827.80] to rent a car like it's like it's like its trivial yeah compared to how we used to think of these things
[1827.80 → 1834.42] it used to be that when I bought a 500 graphics card when the next generation came out that thing
[1834.42 → 1843.12] was worth 200 bucks like it was functionally worthless whereas now what the is going on
[1843.12 → 1850.56] two generational GPUs I'm on Facebook marketplace here okay and 30 90s are like a thousand dollars
[1850.56 → 1855.52] now that's Canadian dollars that's that's rubles worth about four bucks I need to buy more so let's do a
[1855.52 → 1862.62] quick correction okay we'll do a quick conversion here okay so we got oh no, no don't make me sad
[1862.62 → 1874.76] oh no okay so that's you know oh but still dude that's a four and a half year old GPU
[1874.76 → 1882.40] or like 4.4.25 or whatever the math works yeah it's over four year old GPU that is now two
[1882.40 → 1888.40] generations out of date, and they are sick at running these systems because of the 24 gigs of VRAM
[1888.40 → 1889.98] actually crazy
[1889.98 → 1893.86] uh
[1893.86 → 1902.04] yeah I just had to mentally check i I like a new but I didn't want to say the wrong thing, and it sounds
[1902.04 → 1908.84] incorrect no way the fact that the 50 80 is 16 gigs is like what queen boo in chat says that
[1908.84 → 1913.72] they're still like 900 us dollars one bay I wonder if this is one of those things where some of the
[1913.72 → 1920.74] Canadian sellers don't realize how worthless the cad is right now maybe I should be should I be buying
[1920.74 → 1927.22] Canadian 30 90s and flipping them in America let's go oh dude dude look at this
[1928.18 → 1936.26] this founder's edition is at 930 us dollars that's a bid that's a freaking auction wow you have to be
[1936.26 → 1939.94] kidding me no, no hold on this can't be right this can't be right okay hold on hold on
[1939.94 → 1945.06] where's my sold where's my sold at sold items here we go completed items sold items no, no okay no, no
[1945.06 → 1953.62] well actually no dude dude dude oh this is two no these are parts only you have to be you have to be
[1953.62 → 1960.74] kidding me here you have to be kidding me here 830 us 830 us yeah they're going for 800 to a thousand us
[1960.74 → 1968.66] dollars that's bonkers, and it's just because of VRAM i when the 50 90s VRAM was announced I was openly
[1968.66 → 1972.82] disappointed and a few people questioned it because they're like oh it went up it went up I'm like yeah but
[1972.82 → 1979.54] it didn't go up last gen so if you compare it uh like you, you can't ignore the fact that it didn't
[1979.54 → 1985.30] go up with the 4090 in my opinion I think that's what makes it worse because that means in however
[1985.30 → 1996.26] many years we've gone up like eight gigs yikes we are never yikes we are never building a 3090 pc in
[1996.26 → 2005.78] scrapyard wars yeah probably literally never they're going to be a thousand dollars forever that's
[2005.78 → 2017.30] brutal this is ridiculous so if I bought is I got a MSRP 3090 at launch okay 3090 launch MSRP I believe
[2017.30 → 2025.62] it was 1200 but let's just oh no I'm wrong am I wrong it was 1499 okay so is that right fair bit higher
[2025.62 → 2028.02] okay how much was the 3090 ti
[2031.46 → 2039.30] 1999 okay so 1500 us dollars you know what my point still works if I bought this thing at launch okay so
[2039.30 → 2047.38] launch date was let's just double-check that September of uh September 24th of 2020 was it
[2049.38 → 2056.02] uh oh for the 3090 release yeah I believe so I believe it was 2020. Yes September 24th 2020.
[2056.50 → 2062.18] so how many months is that that's like 50 months, so this thing has gone down in value by
[2062.18 → 2072.26] anywhere from 500 to 700 let's call it 600 okay so 600 divided by 50 months means
[2073.62 → 2082.18] that I could have a 59 or excuse me a 30 90 in my computer from launch day till now for 12 a month
[2082.18 → 2088.82] yeah wow and I could and I could sell this thing and get back that much of my money that is flipping
[2088.82 → 2096.90] pun intended crazy that's pretty nuts yeah 1590 like what's a GeForce what's a GeForce now subscription
[2099.46 → 2104.98] like is this going to justify GeForce now no because GeForce now is going to be more expensive than just
[2105.54 → 2113.22] buying a 3090. Buying a 3090 on launch day to be clear yeah to be clear and using it the whole time
[2113.22 → 2120.10] and actually putting in the work to flip it wait you've got to be kidding me mind on it GeForce now is sold out
[2124.90 → 2127.94] this is NVIDIA's game streaming service
[2130.10 → 2130.42] what
[2134.42 → 2137.62] they're running out of subs they've limited that's weird
[2137.62 → 2143.22] for weeks they ran out of they ran out of cloud
[2145.78 → 2158.98] all this tells us is that literally quite literally every wafer NVIDIA can get goes straight to the data
[2158.98 → 2165.86] centre yeah I mean 50 90 50 80 appear to be functionally paper launches yeah um
[2165.86 → 2171.62] they can't even they can't even put GPUs in their own day in their own data centre
[2172.98 → 2176.82] wow even NVIDIA can't get the GPUs they need right
[2178.90 → 2182.34] oh okay hold on someone says read the news they're changing payment processors so they've
[2182.34 → 2187.14] halted subscriptions okay, okay okay hold on hold on so whoever had is not paying until they
[2187.14 → 2191.38] figure this out okay, okay okay maybe it's not that bad maybe it's not that bad okay this is why it's nice
[2191.38 → 2197.06] to have chat thanks chat you guys are great okay well how much I don't know how much it costs then
[2197.06 → 2202.66] the point is I'm pretty sure that this would be less than a GeForce now subscription you also
[2202.66 → 2206.90] have to pay for the rest of stuff in your computer but I guess you'd also have to a device to run GeForce
[2206.90 → 2210.74] now yeah, and you might just like having a computer in general so you know whatever my point is just
[2210.74 → 2216.58] like what you're paying for this the GPU unless you're an AI developer or whatever functions as a
[2216.58 → 2225.62] gaming device yeah, yeah right yep and that 30 90 is not uh not far off uh is actually better than
[2225.62 → 2230.58] a 40 80 in terms of performance anyway and that's the ultimate tier as well so you don't even have to
[2230.58 → 2238.90] spend you know the 1500 at launch or whatever well how do we how do we say it's 20 bucks per month
[2238.90 → 2246.50] ultimate there you go yeah so literally cheaper than streaming just buy the computer yeah
[2248.26 → 2254.18] crazy because that's crazy this is crazy we live in a crazy timeline limited amount of time you can
[2254.18 → 2258.26] use view force now for like you have unlimited hours per month ultimate I don't think is limited
[2258.26 → 2262.50] eight-hour session lengths and then when you're done the session that's not going to be enough for
[2262.50 → 2266.58] some of the people watching right now I guarantee why are you calling out Dan like that uh
[2266.58 → 2272.02] uh that might not be enough for Dan sometimes no I'm not even just saying for gaming because Dan
[2272.02 → 2275.70] does a lot of stuff on his computer oh and there's q times too even with ultimate there's
[2275.70 → 2280.34] q times that's a workstation computer that also plays video games exactly right so like eight hour
[2280.34 → 2285.54] sessions I don't know maybe not maybe oh did I leave though I put on a brand-new shirt before
[2285.54 → 2291.54] the show I'm saying all this big talk it wouldn't work for me yeah no all right there we go
[2291.54 → 2297.14] sorry about that guys what'd you do uh i I had the uh the extra button in the plastic bag hanging
[2297.14 → 2301.78] off the back of my shirt it was bothering people in the chat it's the style you did it on purpose
[2301.78 → 2305.06] all right what are we supposed to be talking about let's do some rich messages I'm not done
[2305.86 → 2311.38] I'm not done okay carry on my next line is uh don't expect open AI to not have an answer for this
[2311.38 → 2317.78] um i I don't think they're just going to like roll over I do I'm not personally surprised I saw a lot of
[2317.78 → 2323.06] hot takes when the market crashed like all these dumb idiot investor people don't understand that
[2323.62 → 2330.42] they still use GPUs for this stuff um I actually understand the crash personally because what this
[2330.42 → 2339.94] signalled was that you can do it much more efficiently and the stock price for NVIDIA as insanely inflated as
[2339.94 → 2345.78] it probably still is um a big part of the reason why it was so inflated was because of the incredible
[2345.78 → 2350.74] inefficiency of AI stuff and the incredible amount of power that were people were needing to buy from
[2350.74 → 2357.78] NVIDIA um so if is it's more efficient than the hundreds of millions billions of dollars being
[2357.78 → 2363.38] flooded into NVIDIA to buy every single possible thing anyone could possibly scrape for them is maybe
[2363.38 → 2369.78] not as much of a thing as it was in the past probably still a thing yeah and the and the the the
[2369.78 → 2378.26] positive for NVIDIA stock you know spin on that is well by being so much more efficient so many more
[2378.26 → 2384.10] people are going to run these things, and so they're going to sell even more GPUs it remains to be seen
[2384.10 → 2389.30] how that plays out but this way we're at least presenting sort of both sides of the argument I have a
[2389.30 → 2397.78] fascinating take on this which is probably pie in the sky and hopeful whatever but um is there if a
[2397.78 → 2402.50] lot of people coming down is it is it falling yeah the pie it's it's the pizza on the roof
[2402.50 → 2411.22] from breaking bad um but uh I don't know man if a lot of people buy some of these to have local LMS at
[2411.22 → 2413.70] home yeah more gaming pcs
[2416.10 → 2421.86] maybe more gaming piece if you're looking at electronic spending for your home and you
[2421.86 → 2427.70] you could have a console wait why do you sorry what do you think if you buy a high-end GPU
[2427.70 → 2433.62] sure to run a LLM at home oh so you can game on it so you're just going like convert the
[2433.62 → 2441.22] faithless bring everyone to pc gaming because they can't run a LLM on their Xbox yeah really deep seek
[2441.22 → 2449.62] destroys console peasants yeah that's the headline yeah okay Xbox is dying anyway it's like that dominoes' meme
[2449.62 → 2457.62] sure switch 2 is going to sell a quintillion units and is also incredibly boring yeah it's probably the
[2457.62 → 2463.78] most boring console and Nintendo has ever announced oh that's an interesting debate hold on let's see
[2464.74 → 2466.98] the most boring console
[2466.98 → 2474.26] new DS
[2476.98 → 2482.02] oh do you count oh this is technically I can't even I can't even remember a bit of a hybrid all the
[2482.02 → 2488.18] different variants of DS at this point to be honest with you wasn't it like new DS plus or something yeah
[2488.18 → 2494.10] i I'm getting a lot of support in chat there's a lot of this was not boring because 2ds was an affordability
[2494.10 → 2501.30] play 2ds was way cheaper people are saying the new 2ds so somewhere between what you and I are
[2501.30 → 2507.30] saying but basically one of the flipping DS's like I'm I'm not convinced that because like Game Boy
[2507.30 → 2512.18] advance does that count though Game Boy advance was huge Game Boy colour was huge back then there was a
[2512.18 → 2516.98] pretty clear delineation between console and handheld I know it's become blurry now, but it was it's a
[2516.98 → 2522.66] console it was clearly it's a handheld gaming console it was clearly separate don't even give me that it
[2522.66 → 2527.38] it was clearly separate don't even give me that it was clearly separate you know it Wii U then got
[2527.38 → 2534.66] him he wasn't boring its I mean no one was interested in it no one knew what it was the definition of
[2534.66 → 2541.86] boring is I don't know don't care no it was so it was so exotic that people couldn't figure out what it
[2541.86 → 2547.14] was it definitely wasn't boring it was weird it was very weird it was not boring it might not have been
[2547.14 → 2551.86] good I liked it might not have been good though is he talking about the Wii U or is he talking about
[2551.86 → 2557.54] sex what just go back and watch that listen to that whole thing what's he talking about
[2559.54 → 2564.18] no one could figure it out no I don't know I'm just I'm just it just sounded like you were talking
[2564.18 → 2570.98] about it doesn't matter um the point is the answer is virtual boy okay the answer is always virtual
[2570.98 → 2574.82] boy virtual boy is not boring okay that's true that's true you're going for like bad or didn't
[2574.82 → 2581.78] sell well i actually not the point I'm actually kind of excited for switch too if okay because i
[2581.78 → 2587.70] have i have a little theory I have a little theory it's an it's a theory but they used
[2587.70 → 2593.86] the newer encoding engine yes that could move it to being more interesting if I can do with yeah if
[2593.86 → 2600.50] if it uses because we haven't even seen yet on 50 series what is what that's going to mean for
[2600.50 → 2605.78] things like moonlight for streaming like is the quality because it's garbage in garbage out right
[2605.78 → 2616.10] so if is you're encoding at much higher um colour depth than or with at 422 basically if you're is you're
[2616.10 → 2623.06] encoding with much higher quality then when you decode that on the other side on your you know on your TV
[2623.06 → 2629.06] or on your handheld device uh, or you know on your like Logitech g cloud or whatever right when you
[2629.06 → 2633.14] decode that theoretically it should look better I haven't we haven't had a chance to look at any
[2633.14 → 2640.26] of this yet um this is potentially another w for big GPU enjoy your LLM people yeah I guess that's true
[2640.26 → 2646.42] just saying but anyway the point is that if Nintendo is using a newer generation encoder that i
[2646.42 → 2652.34] don't know has really great latency or really great encoding quality and I can stream my switch from
[2652.34 → 2659.22] somewhere else I think it kind of brings some of the spirit of the Wii U into modern era which is
[2659.22 → 2665.22] which is kind of cool so I can use it three ways now I can use it docked at the TV I can use it
[2665.22 → 2670.58] handheld or I can use it docked at the TV with a separate lightweight high battery life handheld that
[2670.58 → 2674.82] would be flipping cool with like a mobile app or something I don't know that Nintendo would go mobile
[2674.82 → 2680.66] app I mean Sony did though you can buy a PS portal, or you can just not, and you can just use an android
[2680.66 → 2685.62] app that's super cool I didn't know that actually yeah that's cool yeah no it's genuinely cool so
[2685.62 → 2692.10] the Logitech cloud is one of the few examples now that I've been doing this so many years i generally
[2692.10 → 2698.02] have a pretty good idea if something's going to be phenomenally stupid before I start reviewing it
[2698.02 → 2703.94] but that was one of the few examples of something that I was completely dismissive of and I went into
[2703.94 → 2710.74] it and I was like oh this is this makes for the right person I mean I don't still use one because
[2710.74 → 2716.50] i just game on an ally I have my compute locally because I prefer the lower latency but for the
[2716.50 → 2721.30] right person there's wow this makes a ton of sense because the battery life's great and there's a ton of
[2721.30 → 2724.98] games where it doesn't matter there's a ton of games where it doesn't matter seven's right around the
[2724.98 → 2732.82] corner yeah I mean I wouldn't play that with a controller but like I know people do someone on a
[2733.46 → 2737.30] yeah maybe not on a switch but on a steam deck you have those pads dude someone messaged me on steam
[2737.30 → 2742.74] the other day saying they play Anna on their handheld oh I know right, but they're they've apparently
[2743.30 → 2748.66] really enjoying it steam deck has the touchpads right yeah it might not be as bad man I think that
[2748.66 → 2754.66] would suck though I would not want to play Anna, and it was a whole different beast than safe
[2755.86 → 2761.54] there you go oh okay so it is a steam deck because I'm not surprised any no this isn't the post this is
[2761.54 → 2766.58] just this is just a post of someone playing Anna on the steam deck yeah lower the graphics setting to
[2766.58 → 2772.10] medium still stutters a bit I'll report back later yeah no I mean that's not the easiest game to run
[2772.10 → 2778.34] ever it actually is, and it has a super weird optimization curve so um at that when you
[2778.34 → 2784.10] max it out it will kind of crush your GPU in spite of honestly not really looking that much
[2784.10 → 2788.10] better that's probably why I didn't think it was, and it has some issues like if you max
[2788.10 → 2794.66] max it out, and you're in the x12 mode I can't remember, but it will basically fail to launch and
[2794.66 → 2801.06] they've just never fixed it but at relatively low detail settings the developers specifically
[2801.06 → 2807.46] optimized it to run until the integrated graphics whoa yeah so it actually runs really well wow um if you
[2807.46 → 2812.34] turn the details down that's actually sick yeah that's cool I love stuff like that I didn't know
[2812.34 → 2819.54] that at all that's that's oh we're supposed to explain merch messages now are you done no okay
[2819.54 → 2825.70] carry on uh I think I was actually kind of kidding um yeah I don't know I feel like I could talk about
[2825.70 → 2832.74] this stuff forever um so he's done, but this is earmarking like i I do want us to get some
[2832.74 → 2837.86] local resources one for people to just start playing with it um but also like I want to start
[2837.86 → 2844.58] running better models for like inline IDE assistance for developers uh locally and potentially remote
[2844.58 → 2850.42] and not paying like big fat fees to open AI for that cool would be pretty cool especially if we can
[2850.42 → 2857.30] just like make a video doing it, and then you know that helps pay for it that'd be pretty sick speaking
[2857.30 → 2861.62] of helping pay for things if you guys like the show you want to interact don't just throw money at
[2861.62 → 2866.58] your screen we don't really do twitch bits or super chats or anything like that we do merch messages
[2866.58 → 2873.14] to send a merch message all you got to do is go to ltdstore.com add some great incredible stuff like
[2873.14 → 2881.06] our new sport button up shirt to your cart, and you will get a little box that you can fill out and send
[2881.06 → 2885.62] in a merch message uh we're going to do a couple of them show you guys how it works, but basically it'll go
[2885.62 → 2890.82] to producer Dan who will reply a little something like that look at that he's ready to wave he's ready to
[2890.82 → 2895.70] wave I was waving already are you ready to wave now oh no god oh well there he is oh nice what
[2895.70 → 2900.82] what you can't leave with that hand sorry anyway the point is it goes through producer Dan he will
[2900.82 → 2906.02] reply, or he'll forward it to someone, or he will curate it for me and Luke, but before we do a couple
[2906.02 → 2909.70] of them show you how it works uh let's talk about our new sport button up Luke do you like wearing
[2909.70 → 2916.74] dress shirts no yeah that's fair, and you know what I get it sometimes they suck uh they're stiff
[2916.74 → 2921.70] they're sweaty they don't move with your body well our fashion team made it their mission to prove
[2921.70 → 2927.86] that you can look like you have your life together while still also being comfy that's why we made the
[2927.86 → 2933.06] sport button-up shirt it's made from the same four-way stretch material that we use for our premium sport
[2933.06 → 2939.22] joggers it's lightweight it moves with your body and is even sweat wicking I see you
[2939.22 → 2946.18] it's super versatile it can be easily paired with a suit or worn casually on top of a t-shirt
[2946.18 → 2951.78] it also has a handy pocket to stash your pens snacks or patience and of course we couldn't go without
[2951.78 → 2957.30] adding a little bit of flair on the back bottom left of the shirt is a fun rainbow reflective LTT logo oh
[2960.74 → 2967.38] from my experience uh don't wash that or don't uh dry that on with heat just you know care instructions
[2967.38 → 2973.78] and all that anyway they're available now at leg.GG sport button up Dan if you want to hit all the
[2973.78 → 2978.34] chats with that that would be swell uh we also have one more announcement before we get started
[2978.34 → 2983.86] on merch messages help us make our website better over the past few years we've expanded into so many
[2983.86 → 2988.66] different product categories on Ltd store we know that sometimes it can be a bit of a challenge to
[2988.66 → 2993.30] find what you're looking for fortunately we're working on making the store a little bit easier to
[2993.30 → 2998.58] navigate but to do it right we need your input if you're interested in contributing please scan the
[2998.58 → 3005.78] QR code to take part and this says Dan show the thing which he's already doing what a guy what a guy
[3007.78 → 3014.82] all right shall we do a couple merch messages we shall let's do that just got a new mechanical
[3014.82 → 3019.62] keyboard and so far I hate it because of things like chattering and keys getting mistyped
[3019.62 → 3041.54] uh I'm trying to think what would even cause that like if you had uh a crappy mechanical keyboard well
[3041.54 → 3048.90] yeah is it i I would return it yeah to be honest yeah that's a good idea I would just return it
[3048.90 → 3051.94] because well I'm just trying to think what would even cause that like if you have really cheap
[3051.94 → 3058.42] mechanical switches and the stems wobble or if you had really heavy caps point is that a weird part
[3058.42 → 3062.66] and if you type in a certain way and you kind of like bounce it can like triple register I think
[3062.66 → 3069.78] that's what he means by chattering um the the've got bad switches' bro they'll like miss input of the
[3069.78 → 3077.62] keys or whatever however he described it um keys getting mistyped keys getting miss typed I don't
[3077.62 → 3082.18] fully know what that means you got a bad keyboard but just return it I think you got a broken keyboard
[3082.18 → 3087.30] if your keyboard isn't keyboarding send it back yeah get a different keyboard because man you can get
[3087.30 → 3092.90] dude you can get affordable like you can get mechanical keyboards for less than you just spent on LTT store
[3093.62 → 3099.30] that are great these days so you just need to find one of those go the other direction right you can
[3099.30 → 3103.94] not I'm not telling you to spend a lot of money, but there 's's infinite scaling here and genuinely
[3104.50 → 3109.22] there's people who spend thousands of dollars on the keyboards um you can build your own you could go
[3109.22 → 3115.78] with a really fancy pre-built one you could go with a lower end pre-built one that just isn't junk like it
[3115.78 → 3120.90] sounds like yours is unfortunately um someone said reckon for not too much I really like reckon stuff
[3120.90 → 3129.14] um I was really impressed by the one that we showed in the all china pc uh let me just get past this ad and
[3129.14 → 3135.86] then i will show if it's an ad for galaxy AI there are genuinely a ton of options though and
[3135.86 → 3142.90] those issues that you're describing should not exist that is uh bad don't accept that just send it
[3142.90 → 3152.02] back get your money back you can't, you can't have like oh look at that look at that it happened to
[3152.02 → 3158.02] go right to the part where we were talking about the keyboard amazing 50 bucks for this a la whatever
[3158.02 → 3165.38] it is that was really smooth that was a pretty nice thing dang we can't, we can't wait we can't praise
[3165.38 → 3171.06] him like that's going to go to his head damn I'm pretty good sometimes hold on all the time damn that was
[3171.06 → 3175.70] pretty good damn what the heck I don't remember doing that if you buy this keyboard you have to
[3175.70 → 3183.78] do you have to try to do that when you get it yeah so this f98 was like 50 bucks and I was dude I was
[3183.78 → 3191.38] super impressed by it this is super nice all right cool hi LLD what single thing in tech has made
[3191.38 → 3197.14] you feel the oldest my mom's master project was on ray tracing, and it is now in a museum
[3201.06 → 3209.14] I mean that's sick that's super cool your mom sounds awesome just putting that out there I don't
[3209.14 → 3214.02] have to try that hard to feel old in tech just because so much of my life is just doing tech
[3214.02 → 3218.58] things and talking about tech um you have to post whatever that project is on the Reddit yeah for
[3218.58 → 3224.26] sure please do that Sammy with a forum to Sammy pointed out discord to that we're at the five-year
[3224.26 → 3228.98] anniversary of the I'm thinking about retiring stream that or tweeted at us completely blew my mind
[3228.98 → 3234.74] um I was playing have I talked on wan show before about playing lords of the realm 2 with my son
[3235.22 → 3240.90] I have okay that made me feel pretty old that you know what was a game that I played when I was
[3241.86 → 3249.30] not much younger than him looks like you know crude chicken scratch 2d compared to what exists
[3249.30 → 3257.54] now it all makes me feel old like you look at 10-year-old games, and it's like uh it doesn't look too
[3257.54 → 3262.90] bad you look at 20-year-old games you're like to woo that looks pretty old you look at 30 old games and
[3262.90 → 3271.54] it's like whoa and then and then you remember how amazing you thought it looked oh yeah like I remember
[3271.54 → 3279.86] playing um the 20-year-old ones I remember playing um I thought Morten looks sick soul reader legacy of Kane
[3279.86 → 3286.98] I remember being impressed with the water and Morten okay it's horrible it's so bad but I went from like
[3286.98 → 3297.06] a n64 to that man whatever so I remember playing this game okay and thinking that the in-game you know
[3297.78 → 3307.38] seemed kind of like that um box art no this that yeah that must be a remaster hold on
[3307.38 → 3314.42] uh where here we go here we go this is it is didn't it did not look like the box art this
[3314.42 → 3319.30] is what it looked like and I remember thinking wow this looks so incredible I mean the fact that
[3319.30 → 3326.82] it was 3d at all blew my mind when did it come out uh that's a good question soul reader legacy of Kane
[3327.70 → 3335.94] but I don't know 1999 1999 that's pretty good for 99 yeah I mean it was good for 99, but it doesn't
[3335.94 → 3341.30] look pretty good doesn't look very good today what about the original mech warriors oh I remember
[3341.30 → 3346.74] thinking that was just like boxes dude I didn't dad I need a better GPU so I could play
[3346.74 → 3354.10] back warriors one I never tried a mech warrior game until like way after the fact so I was going back
[3354.10 → 3359.86] and trying to play them once you know graphics were good and I was just like this is not fun like it's
[3359.86 → 3366.34] it's not good enough to be fun some old games still manage to be pretty fun the biggest problem
[3366.34 → 3371.30] for me with old games is not the graphics it's the control schema some of the old controls for games
[3371.30 → 3375.86] are just like yeah we uh you go back, and you're you're just so confused about the quality of life
[3375.86 → 3380.66] stuff that we've just take we take that for granted yeah that always gets me I can overlook a
[3380.66 → 3384.18] decent amount of that for me, it really it's the controls when you can't change them
[3384.18 → 3391.46] yeah change them I'm willing to bet this game would still be fun this is spectre
[3395.06 → 3399.94] whoa it's an it's a tank game I guarantee you this game made people emotions oh there we go
[3399.94 → 3406.34] that's a little better I don't look sick I don't remember looking this good that is super playable
[3406.34 → 3413.06] yeah so you had multiple views and there was a there was a wireframe there was like a wireframe view
[3413.06 → 3417.86] so your tank wouldn't be solid it could be like uh you're going to see through a little bit yeah it
[3417.86 → 3423.22] gives me iron vibes yeah it was pretty cool that's wicked for mac man back when yeah it looked like
[3423.22 → 3429.86] this 91 1991 let's go yeah here it is here it is here it is that must have been a banger in 91. And
[3429.86 → 3434.74] this is the explosions when you blow up a tank dude so cool I like it because that almost feels
[3434.74 → 3440.10] like a like a like an art style thing more than a limitation which is always cool I've seen stuff
[3440.10 → 3444.58] come out these days with that kind of graphic style yeah sweet what about chip's challenge did
[3444.58 → 3451.54] either of you play chips I did bummer I did what bummer I shook my head oh no that's from they used
[3451.54 → 3456.82] to say that in the game oh I don't remember that I don't even know if my computer had speakers at that
[3456.82 → 3462.18] point you couldn't take that kind of thing for granted all right what kind of midi card you got in
[3462.18 → 3474.82] there, but your sound card works perfectly I got a sound blaster oh this guy balling uh what are we
[3474.82 → 3485.30] supposed to do yeah jams float plane chat he knows what that's from uh what are we doing now
[3485.30 → 3493.94] two more topics what do you want to talk about Luke you want to pick one uh sure let's see here
[3494.82 → 3502.42] I lied I'm picking it I just picked one fine we can do yours fine no you'll do yours all right uh
[3502.42 → 3508.66] we can poison AI now and even more oh no not more AI okay no we're doing mine talking about AI again
[3508.66 → 3515.14] it's so good pebble Tammy mentioned on Sancho pebbles coming back all right Hathaway reported on a
[3515.14 → 3521.46] flurry of pebble news this week pebble if you guys don't remember was an e-paper smartwatch that
[3521.46 → 3531.30] was introduced with a kickstarter in 2012. Let's see if we can find some file footage pebble watch
[3534.90 → 3540.66] oh of course it's all it's all from now okay look at that the first one that's actually from then
[3540.66 → 3548.90] oh this guy what a nerd I know not her yeah hold on I mean she might be a nerd wait a minute
[3549.62 → 3558.50] oh it's unskippable to forget it I'm over it anyway the point is I loved the pebble not because it had a
[3558.50 → 3564.26] bunch of great functionality or because it was the best looking device with the cleanest most
[3564.26 → 3570.74] minimalistic design but because it just freaking did what it was supposed to do which was it displayed
[3570.74 → 3576.90] my stupid notifications for me, and it had an easy-to-use interface with physical flipping buttons
[3578.02 → 3588.02] dude it was so easy to use that i actually still up until i um un togethered my motorcycle a couple of
[3588.02 → 3594.58] years ago was still using a pebble time which was a successor to this one after so there was this and
[3594.58 → 3599.46] the pebble steel and the pebble time if I recall correctly I was still using a pebble time to control
[3599.46 → 3606.34] media playback when I would ride my motorcycle i I hot glued a magnet to the back of it and then I hot
[3606.34 → 3610.82] glued a magnet to my bike and then I would just put it on there so I could take it off and charge it
[3610.82 → 3618.02] and then throw it on my bike for my uh for my in helmet speakers like why the crap is no one else
[3618.02 → 3626.50] making a super energy efficient smartwatch with physical buttons is exactly what the uh original
[3626.50 → 3633.94] pebble founder Eric midzikovsky said when he launched rebebble.com and was like dang it if no one's gonna
[3633.94 → 3640.74] do this after we were acquired by google in 2021 then or rather acquired by Fitbit in 2016 which
[3640.74 → 3645.70] was then acquired by google in 2021 then we're just going to bring it back and this is so cool
[3645.70 → 3652.66] a team including former peelers turned googles has been working on open sourcing the OS for the
[3652.66 → 3661.94] last year the code is on GitHub so not only is Eric relaunching the pebble with repebble.com so I'm just
[3661.94 → 3669.54] gonna fire this up here but oh hold on pebble.com oh no I've mistyped it
[3669.54 → 3674.50] but hold on I'm going to do this I'm going to do this successfully open source is popping off
[3674.50 → 3680.42] on way not only is he relaunching some hardware, but this might not be the only hardware
[3681.38 → 3688.10] because the OS is open source that is so cool that is very cool that is so flipping cool
[3689.62 → 3692.90] bringing it back it's open source we're making new pebble watches
[3692.90 → 3698.26] anyone can use pebble OS in any way they want to do you want a new pebble uh yeah a little bit
[3699.54 → 3706.74] freaking awesome I'm personally really excited because as much as I wear an Apple Watch I don't
[3707.30 → 3714.42] like it, I have never liked a smartwatch the way that I liked my pebble oh it's Google open sourcing
[3714.42 → 3719.30] this yeah super cool i I assumed they left the company to work on this but yeah no this is
[3719.30 → 3726.50] officially google open sourcing yeah it's so cool sweet okay these announcements have caused some
[3726.50 → 3732.18] serious excitement for the rebel project which has been working since 2016 to maintain an advanced
[3732.18 → 3736.90] pebble functionality in the absence of pebble technology corp and does so through their rebel
[3736.90 → 3741.14] web services rebels will murphy stated that these developments are massive for rebel and will
[3741.14 → 3745.22] accelerate our efforts to produce new hardware rebel has also announced they're going to become a
[3745.22 → 3750.74] non-profit organization and allow the community to take ownership of the project check out rebel.io
[3750.74 → 3758.98] that's rebel r-e-b-b-l-e dot i-o for more information wow I didn't realize kind of how deep this went no
[3758.98 → 3766.74] this is so cool I actually had a call with Eric um last week when he was just kind of talking about
[3767.38 → 3771.86] um you know potential ways to work together and stuff like that and I was like look what it really just
[3771.86 → 3778.82] boils down to for me is I'm stoked sick so like as soon as you guys have got some new hardware I'm
[3778.82 → 3782.82] like I'm so in I'm I'm so ready yeah, yeah super exciting
[3785.62 → 3792.26] fine you can talk about your AI let's go talk about your AI uh we can poison AI in even more ways now
[3792.26 → 3796.82] several methods of poisoning AI models have been circulating for a while now while none of them are
[3796.82 → 3802.58] 100 effective at tricking computers and have trade-offs they have been successful at making
[3802.58 → 3807.78] scraping data more expensive and more difficult for these companies with the aim of reducing AI's
[3807.78 → 3816.02] long-term feasibility and all four are available for you to use now YouTuber fame um often written
[3816.02 → 3824.18] with a four instead of the um has made a video demonstrating how to use the dot ass subtitle format or
[3824.18 → 3831.46] dot ass I don't know yeah I mean it's technically dot ass yeah so dot ass it just is what it is
[3831.46 → 3839.54] dot ass man I'm not swearing I'm just saying what it is yeah dot ass yeah anyway uh she
[3839.54 → 3844.90] demonstrates how you can use the dot ass subtitle format to combat trawlers or crawlers from stealing
[3844.90 → 3850.82] content by adding junk caption data that should only affect AI nice a professor at the university of
[3850.82 → 3856.02] Chicago and his students have created tools uh glaze and nightshade these are again these these
[3856.02 → 3861.54] aren't new uh that scramble how AI interprets photo slash art with minimal visible changes to the human
[3861.54 → 3866.98] eye and an anonymous dev angry that meta's crawler ignored their website's policy and hit their website
[3868.26 → 3876.90] 30 million times struck back with malware uh nepenthes um it's a tar pitting tool that traps AI in an
[3876.90 → 3881.94] infinite maze of static files with no exit links which is pretty sick um and feed some garbage data
[3882.66 → 3889.62] discussion question can you think of any better file type other than dot ass um and I think no, no
[3889.62 → 3895.70] I don't think I can't completely honest uh extremely well, well thought of um do these tools give you
[3895.70 → 3900.26] hope in the fight against the AI takeover of creative ventures and possibly humanity itself nope
[3900.26 → 3905.14] uh nope, but it's fun it's interesting yeah it's great I mean and if you want to protect your stuff
[3905.14 → 3912.90] do it resistance is cool even if it's futile yeah yeah yeah do it yeah the models have already been
[3912.90 → 3918.74] trained and open sourced and put out there it's already been done uh but again really if you do want
[3918.74 → 3925.62] to protect your stuff if you're a particular artist I think, and you have a particular style um I think
[3925.62 → 3930.66] poisoning all your stuff could be a perfect idea um because then you could keep your style from
[3930.66 → 3935.70] being trained on very effectively, or you could resist your style from being trained on very effectively
[3935.70 → 3943.70] um and I think that's the main use for this stuff is like individual uh stylistic defence I don't think
[3943.70 → 3950.58] it's going to stop you know um the wave from happening, but you might be able to resist your specific
[3950.58 → 3957.22] flavour so in other cool news yeah steam OS expands beyond the steam deck check out family's content
[3957.22 → 3964.50] she's cool in the lead up to the Lenovo legion go s launch valve will be improving compatibility with
[3964.50 → 3969.70] other handhelds and will be shipping a beta of steam OS which should improve the experience on other
[3969.70 → 3975.54] handholds users can download and test this for themselves of course we will continue adding support
[3975.54 → 3981.94] and improving the experience with future releases I am super bullish on steam OS I freaking love
[3981.94 → 3987.78] steam OS I can't wait to use it as an oh well I was going to say desktop operating system, but that's
[3987.78 → 3992.58] not actually the truth what I want to use it for is a living room operating system bring back the steam
[3992.58 → 3998.42] machine yeah dude I'm stoked like dude I have an I have a Windows machine in my family room which you
[3998.42 → 4003.06] probably don't know because you've probably never seen me turn it on because it's annoying because it
[4003.06 → 4009.38] runs windows but is configured to just launch steam in big picture mode every time it turns on except
[4009.38 → 4015.30] that because I only use it very infrequently whenever I turn it on there's been some stupid
[4015.30 → 4018.58] Windows update he wants me to go through the windows' setup wizard again I'm like I don't have a keyboard
[4018.58 → 4026.82] connected to this I don't want this I want it to just work I know I don't want to use edge not now
[4027.46 → 4035.70] Microsoft are you sure yeah I'm sure are you sure I'm really sure not now I want to just use my
[4035.70 → 4047.30] software and not yours yeah yeah yeah I'm dude I'm I'm so excited I'm so excited more steam OS
[4047.94 → 4055.30] yeah I agree yeah what else we got Sony removes PSN requirements on four pc games Sony has removed the
[4055.30 → 4059.78] mandatory PlayStation account requirement from four single-player pc games spider-man 2 last of us
[4059.78 → 4064.02] part 2 god of war Ragnarök horizon zero dawn remastered are there any original IPS anymore
[4064.02 → 4069.94] these are literally all sequels but go ahead carry on uh this is to incentivize or sorry no
[4069.94 → 4075.22] to incentivize people to still sign in there will be content unlocks when you connect to your account
[4075.22 → 4081.22] okay i actually you know what I like this yeah if you need horse armour that badly then go ahead
[4081.22 → 4085.70] link your account and if you just can't be arsed then hey you have that option now that is sweet
[4085.70 → 4090.82] that is a good way to do it I don't mind them doing some amount of incentive like you know it is what
[4090.82 → 4095.54] it is uh this comes nearly after a year of the backlash around the post-launch PSN requirement for
[4095.54 → 4101.14] hell divers 2 locking people in territories not served by PSN this is the entire reason why this
[4101.14 → 4105.54] matters out of the game that they have already paid for to be clear there are regions in the world
[4105.54 → 4112.50] whole countries that cannot get PSN but were able to buy these games so it literally banned them from
[4112.50 → 4116.58] playing their own game that they owned or potentially banned them from buying it at all in the future
[4116.58 → 4122.66] which is nuts so that's that's going away which is good also Sforza horizon 5 is coming to PS5 this
[4122.66 → 4127.62] spring how did I miss this are you kidding me really is halo next question mark I know a lot of people
[4127.62 → 4132.90] have been saying that they think Starfield is coming soon who cares no one cares about that one okay
[4132.90 → 4138.58] cool but it's an Xbox exclusive title Sforza on PlayStation that's pretty wild because it was
[4138.58 → 4146.42] always gran tourism versus Sforza well yeah yeah what it's weird announced today apparently yeah whoa
[4147.14 → 4151.30] that's wild sorry I'm still I'm still reeling from this one that's
[4153.62 → 4160.18] that was a historic battle for decades I think is this the last generation of Xbox like haven't they
[4160.18 → 4164.02] said they're working on next gen hardware what's the point sorry someone in full plane chat said
[4164.02 → 4170.10] Starfield was fantastic until dot dot dot the event and by that I think they mean the release date yeah
[4170.10 → 4179.06] I'm not I'm not really sure what it could really mean other than that um yeah um loading zone enjoyer
[4179.06 → 4189.54] uh other annoying AI annoying news I'm going to do another fun thing cool we played wan show on our
[4189.54 → 4200.98] school's Dumbarton and sound system how cool is this whoa yeah right that's so sick this is so cool
[4200.98 → 4211.78] wow ridiculously geeky like what anyway cool that's amazing that's all I have to say about that
[4211.78 → 4216.90] is so cool that's like i I think one of the reasons why I love stuff like that is because absolutely
[4217.78 → 4221.54] that is the type of thing that I would want to do if I was in if I was that person oh yeah that's what
[4221.54 → 4226.02] i just yeah the next thing I do is put crisis on it let's play something fun on the Dumbarton for
[4226.02 → 4231.94] whatever reason yeah let's get something silly up there that's sick I love it I love it nice screen
[4231.94 → 4237.06] good-looking yeah it actually looks pretty good that's a nice facility yeah man school sports in
[4237.06 → 4243.78] the U.S. is one of those things that growing up in Canada where the biggest sport at my high school
[4243.78 → 4252.34] was definitely rugby and about four people cared other than the players like there'd be the school
[4252.34 → 4259.30] announcements on Monday or whatever and the rugby team had a result against uh mass and no one
[4259.30 → 4264.82] responds and literally no one is even listening like nobody cared no one really goes to the sport
[4264.82 → 4269.94] unless they have like a significant other playing and even then it's like even then it's like dude
[4269.94 → 4277.54] I don't know it's raining like tell me about it after like dude no one cared, and so I made it
[4277.54 → 4285.14] all the way to adulthood having no idea that like high school level sports are televised in the US
[4286.18 → 4291.54] I went to with my grandpa who used to live in Arizona we went to a university of Arizona
[4291.54 → 4298.34] football game, and it was genuinely deeply difficult for me to comprehend that this was not a NFL game
[4298.34 → 4309.06] it was a massive stadium the stands were full there was people like with body paint that spelled
[4309.06 → 4314.26] things they had a marching band like a massive one that came up during they had a whole crazy
[4314.26 → 4322.02] halftime show that all this stuff here's my high school this is the field that they play rugby on
[4322.02 → 4330.50] where's your Dumbarton now yeah where's even some bleachers yeah definitely not existence they
[4330.50 → 4337.38] literally do not even have a place for spectators because they know nobody's going to watch
[4341.22 → 4345.94] we didn't even we had tennis courts we did not have a tennis team oh is this pickleball is this
[4345.94 → 4350.02] someone in full plane chat right where I saw in full plane chat said the biggest university stadiums in
[4350.02 → 4355.86] the U.S. are almost twice as big as the university of Arizona stadium that place was enormous it's like
[4356.42 → 4361.86] hard to man this is I don't know I don't know I understand a lot more people live down there
[4361.86 → 4369.86] but like dang that's that's crazy um Webb says I've heard college is bigger to that true absolutely dude
[4369.86 → 4377.70] college sports in the states is as big if not bigger than I would say professional sports is here
[4377.70 → 4389.38] like it's its a whole thing man and oh man yeah here's my high school you can barely even tell
[4389.38 → 4394.66] where the fields are yeah no it's green there's some of it's green it is green and there happens
[4394.66 → 4400.02] to be like yeah you could put a line between the fields if you were kind of feeling like it that day
[4400.66 → 4405.62] our track is just like the dirt stuff that's around them, you guys had natural track that was pretty cool
[4405.62 → 4410.66] yeah yeah yeah ours is also a square this has been improved since I was there for sure too though
[4410.66 → 4416.42] that's worth that's worth noting um yeah sorry I can put this back up it was quite not like this
[4416.42 → 4421.94] when I was there so it looks like uh mine was not yeah this wasn't ours by the way this belonged
[4421.94 → 4427.62] to the elementary school who were also nobody watched anybody play um, and it's not just that like
[4427.62 → 4435.62] it's not just like oh well like Linus's school sucked um I mean it probably has fewer you know
[4435.62 → 4439.94] stars than the other one but like yeah now here's the other one this was like the school where people
[4439.94 → 4444.82] cared about the sports a lot when I was growing up they had one little stands area yeah that's it
[4444.82 → 4449.30] that's all they got but the fact that they had like an actual track was huge
[4449.30 → 4459.54] that was a big deal yeah here let's go here we go Thomas Haney Thomas Haney school uh yeah they
[4459.54 → 4465.62] don't even have a track yeah they do have a baseball diamond that's crazy so that's something huge uh i
[4465.62 → 4469.70] guarantee you they never play baseball there it's probably like just for California kickball oh no, no
[4469.70 → 4474.82] they've got actual they've got what appear to be kind of dugouts, and they do oh you know what this may
[4474.82 → 4478.90] actually be used they've got they've got stands and everything I didn't go there so I didn't I don't know how big
[4479.70 → 4483.94] I don't know how big baseball was at this school brooks wood secondary if I remember correctly brooks wood
[4483.94 → 4486.82] secondary did not have I can tell you this looks like a problem
[4489.22 → 4494.26] like especially given that right-handed hitters are gonna pull this way maybe they're maybe they
[4494.26 → 4501.70] just know it'll be fine dyslexic stoner 240 asks what is California kickball um it's pretty much
[4501.70 → 4506.66] baseball but with like a giant rubber ball, and you just roll it so it's like
[4506.66 → 4512.02] like when especially when you're young kids um and you don't have the hand-eye coordination
[4512.02 → 4516.82] to hit a baseball or a softball it's so that you can start to learn the rules of baseball
[4516.82 → 4522.26] uh, but you just like you just kick the ball yeah yeah you just like it's actually decently
[4522.26 → 4527.46] fun when you're in like elementary school yeah yeah until you know everyone can just freaking
[4528.02 → 4533.06] boot if it's pretty fun people are saying that's just kickball up here I remember it being called
[4533.06 → 4536.74] California kickball yeah I don't I don't know I don't know maybe there was a difference I have no
[4536.74 → 4540.90] idea apparently it's just called what makes it California I don't know this is what we called
[4540.90 → 4544.98] it what do you what do you want from me all right google this is like a Royal with cheese thing or
[4544.98 → 4547.62] you know French drawers are just called doors in France
[4547.62 → 4550.74] thanks for that Dan
[4553.94 → 4554.66] is there a difference
[4556.82 → 4561.62] I don't know while kickball and California kickball are often used interchangeably the main distinction
[4561.62 → 4568.02] is that California kickball is essentially just a regional term for the game of kickball particularly
[4568.02 → 4574.02] popularized in the California area and I guess bc often applying a slightly more relaxed or casual
[4574.02 → 4578.18] approach to the game's rules compared to the more structured kickball leagues elsewhere oh interesting
[4578.18 → 4584.82] so is this is kind of like a ping pong table tennis thing where technically i I believe the
[4584.82 → 4592.42] differences in the game are like so minor that only you know someone at a competitive level would care
[4593.06 → 4598.42] but functionally speaking they're like kind of the same thing oh wait the stadium manager of
[4598.42 → 4605.94] that football field is in football play chat that's pretty sick yes so they are essentially the same
[4605.94 → 4613.70] game the difference is one of perception table tennis is an Olympic sport and respected while ping pong is
[4614.82 → 4620.74] a hobby or recreational activity yeah yeah California kickball is the whatever version yeah and like
[4620.74 → 4626.02] okay badminton has something similar if somebody calls it a birdie you know that they're just like a wreck
[4626.02 → 4629.86] like they play in the backyard or whatever they don't actually play badminton they just like
[4631.14 → 4635.38] whereas if they call it a shuttle then you know that they actually like to know the sport and care and
[4635.38 → 4642.98] like play I feel like those types of things exist like for practically everything yeah sure it's just
[4642.98 → 4648.98] like are you are it's so are you in it or are you just an enjoyer filthy casual yeah yeah
[4648.98 → 4657.54] yeah it's fair like it's very I'm looking around i I can't think of um I know of one school
[4658.42 → 4663.30] sort of around here two I know two schools that have like fields where you could really
[4663.30 → 4668.82] watch people play but I think it's mostly because those fields happen to be there and
[4668.82 → 4672.90] they're more community fields than really the school's fields but the school's right next to it so
[4672.90 → 4677.30] they're like yeah we might as well use it too to answer your question in float plane chat uh star
[4677.30 → 4685.06] cat one cock the word that comes after shuttle they asked shuttle what yeah yeah yeah
[4685.06 → 4686.50] cock yeah
[4689.94 → 4694.02] all right what do you guys want to talk about next maybe the word that comes after shuttle uh
[4694.90 → 4700.50] no uh yeah sponsors would be pretty good right whoops yeah

[4845.94 → 4852.18] super, super I actually did this one with my kids um so you get the picture on the box and then you
[4852.18 → 4860.98] also get like a story and then the final puzzle is a little bit different from the box so almost
[4860.98 → 4866.18] everything changes a little bit so you can see right there that TV that they're working on fixing
[4866.18 → 4872.82] is fixed in the final one yeah it's its super cool, and it's its really engaging for the kids and it
[4872.82 → 4880.50] makes it um just a little bit more exciting than just building a freaking puzzle um each set
[4880.50 → 4884.42] comes with a thousand high quality puzzle pieces two puzzle maps two-story comics a limited edition
[4884.42 → 4888.98] sticker pack a hidden clue checklist and an ultimate riddle yeah the checklist at the end is fun because you go
[4888.98 → 4894.18] around, and it's its kind of like the reward when you're done with the puzzle you uh you can go and
[4894.18 → 4898.98] like find all the little things that changes uh there could be a hidden story a mystery or even a secret
[4898.98 → 4903.30] ending and when you're done there might be a twist you'll be treated to a full narrative experience
[4903.30 → 4909.22] rather than just a static picture so check out odd pieces and get 15 off your first order using our link
[4909.22 → 4915.62] in the video description all right we're supposed to do three merge messages now go ahead hit me Dan
[4915.62 → 4922.34] sure thing let me just get to the place where they are hi l2d1 I'm not a morning person so I have a
[4922.34 → 4932.34] pretty elaborate morning ritual can you walk me through your typical morning oh man okay sure so I am also
[4933.06 → 4942.10] not a morning person I do not sleep well, but my kids need to get to school so most mornings um we either
[4942.10 → 4948.50] teamwork getting lunches ready or more often lately because Yvonne is a saint, and she's been coming into
[4948.50 → 4955.78] the office less lately she'll do the lunches and get the kids out the door and then I will drive them
[4955.78 → 4962.26] so I get to get up like 20 minutes later which is pretty nice that's pretty good yep that's not nothing um
[4962.26 → 4970.34] I usually don't eat breakfast I know i really really really really should
[4971.30 → 4980.42] what else I'm no longer a morning shower I'm an I'm a late night bather um I haven't been able to give
[4980.42 → 4985.30] up the morning shower despite also extremely not being a morning person because i just sweat so
[4985.30 → 4992.10] much at night I can't handle it really even with your eight sleep yeah it still happens what it
[4992.10 → 4999.38] can't keep the entirety of me I'm an I'm a big boy only some of me can touch the bed man some of it's up
[5000.10 → 5008.18] I'll be cooking on I'm like a not properly flipped steak I'll be cooking on one side and cold on
[5008.18 → 5012.74] the other and I'll have to like roll over enough and if I'm not if I don't actively roll over enough
[5012.74 → 5018.26] while sleeping I'll wake up and I will be like hot on one side and cool on the other I think we
[5018.26 → 5023.38] should do a cooled blanket video or something because does that exist can you get a cooled blanket
[5023.38 → 5028.10] blanket I don't think so wait I think the chance that you get a leak out of a blanket would be like
[5028.10 → 5032.66] no I think you can get ones that like blow air through it, but the problem is that there's no way
[5032.66 → 5037.38] Emma would want that so it would have to be just the one side yeah so we have to do like you know you
[5037.38 → 5042.58] can set up a curve like a sleeping curve where it changes the temperature over the night yeah i
[5042.58 → 5046.98] we're not doing that no, no no I'm not um, and you're you're supposed to like to raise it at certain
[5046.98 → 5056.10] points and stuff mine is literally just cranked at the absolute bottom and i that's that's the best
[5056.10 → 5062.58] it can do okay so I'm not promising anything but i will uh if it's going to leak all over my
[5062.58 → 5068.02] everywhere I don't know if i uh well look i i I take no responsibility for any of that I don't know
[5068.02 → 5072.74] I don't even know what you're talking about but what I'll say is Dan if you could fire over to
[5073.30 → 5082.18] um Vance to add to the next writers meeting how heavy is it going to be Luke okay do you look a gift
[5082.18 → 5088.90] horse in the mouth if it's not really a gift maybe what am I telling Vance uh that we're going to try and
[5088.90 → 5095.30] figure out a water-cooled blanket for Luke I think that's uh I think it's the right thing to do I think
[5095.30 → 5100.42] water-cooled blanket for Luke is the right thing to do so it just feels right I don't have to take
[5100.42 → 5106.26] morning showers it feels right yeah it feels right I bet what we could even do is we could probably
[5106.26 → 5114.98] modify your eight sleep so that we um so that we branch off of the mattress side of it and we actually
[5114.98 → 5121.46] redirect some of the water flow into the top layer part anyway we won't get too deep into the plan right
[5121.46 → 5128.42] now but I'm I think we could do it this is off-topic, but somebody told me to look up Allen
[5128.42 → 5132.58] high school in Texas and my brain actually exploded I'm flipping over to your laptop
[5135.06 → 5142.10] this is a cluster of five baseball fields this looks like four more baseball steals
[5142.10 → 5148.90] no, no that can't be baseball here can you zoom in more oh wait softball so they delineate that
[5148.90 → 5154.10] so they have four softball fields five baseball fields one of them being like way big they have
[5154.10 → 5162.18] an aquatic centre over there they have all these tennis courts here they have a park uh they have
[5162.18 → 5168.42] some this is all still the school yes they have all these that's not two schools which is
[5168.42 → 5174.42] baseball more baseball and these are like pro-ass looking baseball fields they have
[5174.42 → 5183.46] whatever how many teams do they have eagle stadium this is a high school the Allen eagles
[5185.30 → 5191.78] Allen eagle just sounds like a dude it doesn't sound like a sport it does look at this stadium dude
[5193.22 → 5199.94] oh man, and it has a huge parking lot because I guess people like flipping go to are these something
[5199.94 → 5205.86] what is this I don't know the edge of all the park this is still the high school I don't
[5205.86 → 5211.14] know what this is, but it's still a high school might be getting competitive rowing it literally might
[5211.14 → 5218.18] be this might be water what the flip is going on here that school has a subway like do you mean the
[5218.18 → 5226.74] restaurant or the at this point I don't know or the train oh Knox Allen station uh maybe they mean the train
[5226.74 → 5234.50] train no I don't it's like houses, and maybe they mean both yeah maybe water-skiing shut up no way
[5235.22 → 5242.42] this is doing my this is not uncommon for high schools in Texas says boom zero my old hometown
[5242.42 → 5249.30] with like 25 000 people is this size you have to be kidding me here can I why can't I see information on
[5249.30 → 5256.50] the aquatics the lower freshman centre yes subway restaurant okay that's not even I mean uh well
[5256.74 → 5262.18] well okay is it is a jimmies yeah but that bit is a post-secondary institution true why is this
[5262.18 → 5270.74] panel off the screen what happened I don't know anyway okay I think we get the point wild absolutely wild
[5272.98 → 5280.82] did I zoom the browser oh I totally did okay proton mail oh politically neutral and privacy first
[5280.82 → 5287.46] encrypted email service proton mail has been under fire for both posting and seeming pre-op biased and
[5287.46 → 5292.90] being not so private they've recently handed over a user's information to French legal authorities and
[5292.90 → 5298.34] admitted that they would hand over any info they have if prompted by authorities to comply with Swiss law
[5298.98 → 5306.34] this includes email subjects headers senders recipients times but notably not the body of the emails
[5306.34 → 5311.38] themselves they have also been under fire for posting praise for certain aspects of the U.S.
[5311.38 → 5316.66] Republican Party the original tweet from the CEO said 10 years ago republicans were the party of big
[5316.66 → 5322.58] business and Dems stood for the little guys but today the tables have completely turned the official
[5322.58 → 5327.14] comment or the original comment from the official proton Reddit account said until corporate Dems are
[5327.14 → 5333.86] thrown out the reality is that republicans remain more likely to tackle big tech abuses from the damage
[5333.86 → 5340.98] control thread the CEO posted big tech CEOs are tripping over themselves to kiss the ring uh because
[5340.98 → 5347.46] the new president represents an unprecedented challenge to their monopolistic dominance um Lena
[5347.46 → 5351.38] khan being out now I don't have that doesn't I guess we're not commenting on what they're saying I don't
[5351.38 → 5355.62] think yeah I'm not commenting on what they're saying I'm just uh throwing this out there and as far as
[5355.62 → 5361.38] I'm concerned as far as I could tell neither the democrats nor the republicans wanted Lena khan in so
[5361.38 → 5366.66] yeah I'm pro Lena khan fair enough yeah yeah she's the only one that actually has my support Lena khan
[5366.66 → 5375.14] for prime minister of Canada thank you yep uh good luck everybody we um we love our southern neighbours

[5581.22 → 5587.94] oh see also mansion okay sorry sorry sorry happened at a similar time yeah okay my bad my bad
[5587.94 → 5598.26] cool Facebook ball pit let's go is there anything else we want to talk about uh oh maybe there's this
[5598.26 → 5605.62] one what else is there yeah what even is this is gov using proprietary USB cables LTT forum
[5605.62 → 5612.58] member viper 7 reports that gov cameras will only work with the included USB to c cable
[5612.58 → 5619.70] so rather than replacing a too short cable users are buying extensions to use with the included cables
[5620.82 → 5626.34] um turns out we don't have any gov cameras on hand to confirm these reports so we're asking the
[5626.34 → 5630.66] when audience instead and I guess the main reason that I wanted to bring this up is because
[5631.30 → 5638.42] why does USB have to be USB specifically have to be such a broken weird freaking stupid standard
[5638.42 → 5645.06] it doesn't seem that hard and I'm very excited for us to bring our cables to market and do our
[5645.06 → 5649.54] small part to fix this so they're just going to be clearly labelled with the wattage and the data rate
[5650.26 → 5656.58] and that's it simple they've been a sponsor right yeah that was one of the reasons that I wanted
[5656.58 → 5662.34] to bring it up yeah so we should try to if you have them try to um Elijah says I have a feeling this
[5662.34 → 5667.38] could be a case of someone using a wrong spec like a power why do the power only cables exist
[5667.38 → 5674.42] I know it's good to save four cents on your cable or whatever but oh yeah I wonder what it is
[5674.42 → 5680.42] um I suspect it's I suspect that's right I suspect that's it yeah if you have one uh try to test it
[5680.42 → 5688.02] post on the forum or something yeah all right is this it is it when after dark I think so oh wait no
[5688.02 → 5694.58] we have a free when after dark announcement yes behind every great chief vision officer eyeball there are
[5694.58 → 5702.34] executives that have to wrangle said chief vision officer and on float plane we've had exec week when
[5702.34 → 5709.62] you can meet some of them dun dun dun dun dun dun dun jams drive nick light and Baron tong all sat down
[5709.62 → 5717.70] for interviews with the one and only Sammy so we can go over to the exclusives, and you can meet the team
[5717.70 → 5723.94] all three of these guys um they did a great job they were good sports and that's our that's our float
[5723.94 → 5730.42] plane exclusive update for the week let's go if meeting execs isn't your cup of tea you can watch my
[5730.42 → 5739.70] wisdom tooth post-surgery um drug trip, or you can catch up on why is when late since there is a new
[5739.70 → 5745.62] episode next week a bunch of people saying taken's interview is perfect uh some people asking where
[5745.62 → 5750.82] mine is I had a whole week to myself because I'm a special little flower I guess so he's our special
[5750.82 → 5757.62] boy um yeah i think weeks are generally three videos for float planes so you you you get
[5757.62 → 5765.46] three people got them all right what else we got after dark yeah let's do it yeah Dan you're up i have to
[5765.46 → 5774.10] push a couple buttons first look at this guy wait for it wait for it and there's some people talking
[5774.10 → 5779.22] in I don't remember where it was that they missed the actual dark after darks I was about to say
[5779.78 → 5784.34] those words exactly yep I miss it too I understand the reason how dare you steal my words
[5785.78 → 5789.38] pretty good they were my words pretty good at it, you're good at it better than you at it
[5789.38 → 5800.90] okay the pre-show viewers will get it and I am not explaining that
[5804.34 → 5808.58] uh but yeah I understand the reasoning, and you know it's probably still the correct reasoning but
[5808.58 → 5817.62] I do miss it being dark i do don't even look at these guys still unheeding words the
[5817.62 → 5824.34] regular the regular show cannot handle that you are too spicy for the pepper sir
[5824.34 → 5835.30] all right let's get back to the most important part of the show where I get to talk
[5843.62 → 5849.22] oh man all right anyway uh I'm loving I apologize for what I did
[5849.22 → 5855.86] um oh you admit it you're terrible oh right I'm loving the look of the point I lost point yeah
[5856.50 → 5862.42] personal attack against him mark for down yeah yeah I'm loving the look of the new shirt and that I can
[5862.42 → 5868.26] wear it at work when will we get some pants to go with it, we'd love to have a full LDT office
[5868.26 → 5873.06] appropriate set oh the tech pants are back in development so um they
[5873.06 → 5882.18] uh they the original prototypes which uh we went through like five revisions on all of them
[5882.18 → 5890.42] uh suffered from a condition that I call vagina pocket syndrome where basically they had zipper pockets
[5890.42 → 5898.90] because even on like a dressier pant we don't look at your face I just even on a dressier pant we
[5898.90 → 5904.58] didn't want your stuff to fall out of your pockets so we had zippers on the main pockets but the problem
[5906.10 → 5911.06] the problem was that whenever the zippers were undone because it was like inside a thing and there
[5911.06 → 5918.02] was a full that kind of looked like you had two vaginas on your hips so we could, we have like to do you
[5918.02 → 5922.90] have like penis pocket problems when you put your screwdriver in your pocket no, no no we definitely
[5922.90 → 5928.66] don't have pockets there for screwdrivers but if we did, it would be a problem anyway uh the point is that
[5928.90 → 5937.86] it um we couldn't solve vagina pocket syndrome so we kind of cancelled the tech pants okay it looked
[5937.86 → 5944.34] it looked terrible it wasn't even just like oh Linus you have such a sick mind whatever
[5944.98 → 5950.90] like in the meeting we're all standing there like oh my god i those shorts that I wear all the time
[5950.90 → 5956.74] have zipper pockets maybe it's like an angle thing or so it's the material it's the positioning its
[5956.74 → 5965.06] it's it was everything okay it was very difficult um so anyway they're back and this time
[5965.06 → 5970.90] they're going to be based on the very successful very well received cargo pants block which is what
[5970.90 → 5981.38] like a like a basic pattern is called um, and we did a first round and um it's particularly
[5981.38 → 5988.74] um noticeable on me because I have kind of wide childbearing hips um especially for a male um
[5989.54 → 5999.14] and even on me um the VPS uh issue it seems to be resolved so i I am pretty excited hopefully I don't
[5999.14 → 6005.06] know who knows some months hopefully this year uh, but our tech pants are going to be the same fit as the
[6005.06 → 6015.70] cargo pants um very plumber bum resistant um no VPS on the pockets um and and and more a more of a
[6015.70 → 6022.98] professional office look yeah we're we're working on it, we're going to get there okay yeah all right
[6024.26 → 6028.98] it's not the answer I was expecting howdy LLD Linus after watching channel super fun do you still find
[6028.98 → 6034.66] brand stickers in your house when Dennis was living in your new house yes really there are still
[6034.66 → 6039.94] stickers in my house yes there are because my kids helped so they put them freaking everywhere
[6040.74 → 6044.74] yeah that's a good way to do that yeah there's still a light fixture that's like kind of out of
[6044.74 → 6051.06] the way and inconvenient to get at that has one on it yeah it's really nice it's perfect hey
[6051.06 → 6057.54] everyone I work as an urban planner and technology's importance has been rapidly growing in our field
[6057.54 → 6062.98] do did you see or use any cool technology when you're selecting locations for the badminton centre
[6062.98 → 6073.22] no um honestly the location considerations were most it was mostly just okay i I actually looked
[6073.22 → 6078.50] this up very recently because I was trying to figure out how long I'd been trying to open that thing
[6078.50 → 6085.46] and from the day I started to the day we did our soft opening it was somewhere between five and six
[6085.46 → 6091.30] years I think and the reason it took me so long is that I needed a bunch of stars to align i
[6091.30 → 6098.34] needed something with ample parking so that basically ruled out almost any new building I needed
[6098.34 → 6103.30] something with high ceilings so that ruled out almost anything old and anything other than a
[6103.30 → 6109.46] warehouse basically I needed something zoned for recreational use which ruled out anything other
[6109.46 → 6117.06] than the city of Richmond the city of Langley or further east or surrey specifically has a carve out as
[6117.06 → 6121.86] long as it's less than 50 percent of the building which is why we're able to do it because we have
[6121.86 → 6126.82] two units out of the four but because the electrical mechanical room is in one of our units we're actually
[6126.82 → 6134.34] like 49 of the usable floor space so we're able to be an auxiliary use recreational use business there
[6134.98 → 6143.94] um I needed it to be somewhat accessible to the badminton community um so it's a very popular sport in some
[6143.94 → 6149.14] parts of the world and not a very popular sport in other parts of the world so generally speaking
[6149.14 → 6158.34] like your typical you know white boy doesn't really play badminton um but in Southeast Asia in India um in
[6158.34 → 6168.50] china and Taiwan um badminton is super popular um, and so I wanted to be close to you know where there's a high
[6168.50 → 6174.74] density of of of like a high population density of people who have come from those areas because
[6174.74 → 6180.50] they're far more likely to play badminton um yeah it basically just came down to all of that
[6181.14 → 6186.66] I didn't have a chance to use any technology because it took me like four and a half years to find
[6186.66 → 6194.26] something that would work at all I'm I'm dude I'm I'm stoked on how it's turned out though um we had our we
[6194.26 → 6201.38] had our launch a little while ago of our memberships and stuff, and it's dude it's going great people are
[6201.38 → 6206.74] freaking loving it like freaking loving it
[6213.14 → 6213.54] loving it
[6216.02 → 6221.06] yeah it's been really it's been really great someone's got an um assistant yeah yeah my watch
[6221.06 → 6226.58] was talking to me oh not even talking to you Siri rude to interrupt
[6228.50 → 6235.38] hi Linus I noticed that you have a really deliberate diction especially when similar sounding
[6235.38 → 6240.58] are in sequence is this something you have always done or practiced and intentional skill
[6241.46 → 6248.02] uh it's from just watching our videos back and trying to make them intelligible especially knowing
[6248.02 → 6254.50] that people now typically it seems watch videos at anywhere from one and a half x to two x so if i
[6254.50 → 6260.98] mumble my words or I slur them together than what I've noticed is that the comprehendability of what
[6260.98 → 6267.62] I'm saying goes way down if there aren't clear breaks between my words it's also a habit that doesn't
[6267.62 → 6273.30] come naturally to me but that I have tried to adopt in order to make me a little bit easier to edit
[6273.30 → 6280.50] uh if you have your words go together like this then you can't really pick up mid-sentence and do a
[6280.50 → 6285.14] retake and which is so convenient sometimes because you might have done like a killer job with the
[6285.14 → 6288.82] beginning of what you're saying but then screw up something tiny, and you really want that
[6288.82 → 6296.58] back yeah and if you could keep it somehow that would be nice noise hey oh sorry you see our buffalo
[6296.58 → 6300.90] says you said before the wisdom tooth surgery you used to have a lisp too yeah I had a pretty pronounced
[6300.90 → 6307.38] lisp before I got my dental appliances, and they reshaped my palette, and it's kind of been coming back
[6310.98 → 6317.94] anyway hey LLD if you could travel back in time to the 20th century and bring LTT with you
[6317.94 → 6325.94] what technology would you love to cover or revisit the birth of oh I think like long distance communications
[6325.94 → 6335.70] would be something that I'd be super, super into the wire yeah yeah and yeah like switch so much dude
[6335.70 → 6340.26] switchboards you have ever seen a switchboard they're crazy freaking wild absolutely wild super cool early
[6340.26 → 6349.22] telecom stuff would have been insane yeah um honestly any early computer things were just wild yeah you
[6349.22 → 6354.82] should go you should go uh when you guys are done this watching land show like imagine the content
[6355.94 → 6360.66] I don't know we're not making videos at that point but whatever content you're making in that era
[6360.66 → 6365.62] imagine the content you could make on the first like three and a half inch hard drive
[6366.74 → 6376.98] like mind-blowing dude go watch these videos from uh smarter every day and Linus tech tips this uh memory
[6376.98 → 6383.70] module um actually I can't remember if that's the compute module or the memory module the point is the ram
[6383.70 → 6386.34] the ram was literally the hand woven
[6388.82 → 6397.14] so cool woven memory is yeah, yeah okay this is ram it is ram you can see it's 14 kilobytes of ram in my hand there
[6397.14 → 6403.22] and that's how they programmed it right so cool they've wired the program bonkers
[6403.22 → 6413.14] hey DLL I work in the trading industry as a software developer and I loved the equine DC video do you
[6413.14 → 6420.66] think x86 CPUs are going to be able to scale past 128 cores excited about the backpack no, no they'll never
[6420.66 → 6430.58] get there never get there never going to get there not happening yeah okay I was like hold on a second what are you talking about yeah I'm kidding
[6431.14 → 6440.74] uh I mean AMD and intel are clearly uh clearly still into it adding more and more course um okay knight's corner
[6440.74 → 6453.38] technically x86, but they were pretty like weak sauce compared to oh yeah but still yeah we're talking cores I mean that's that's fair enough
[6457.30 → 6469.30] knight's corner was 50 cores per chip um when did it come like 20 years ago no, no no, no no, no no, no 14 yeah
[6470.74 → 6478.02] it's not that far off all right hit me Dan ignoring GPUs the CPU uplifts this generation have been really disappointing
[6478.02 → 6487.22] how come we've seen 30 plus performance for arm CPUs like the new QC sd8 elite but not x86 not so much
[6487.22 → 6494.34] that hasn't been true for x86 well that and snapdragon 8 elite um got a node shrink
[6494.34 → 6502.42] like uh TSMC's latest note is so flipping expensive almost no one's using it apple's using it Qualcomm's
[6502.42 → 6510.66] using it but NVIDIA didn't use it for their latest GPUs and like that's a lot of the really really really
[6510.66 → 6521.30] smart ideas have been done to optimize chip design um so you know it used to be easy or easy
[6521.30 → 6526.42] to get big performance gains because you could just cram more transistors in because you just have
[6526.42 → 6531.30] a new process node that allows you to shrink the freaking transistors but um when you can't do that
[6531.30 → 6541.54] well you end up with NVIDIA's RTX 50 series um, and you can see this you can see this increase in cost
[6542.10 → 6550.18] as we go down to more and more recent process nodes, and you can see the way that companies like am dare actually
[6551.14 → 6556.58] optimizing their cost for their products by avoiding it whenever possible like you look at their latest
[6556.58 → 6563.38] dozen processors they don't use they don't use the same node for their Io die that they do for the CCDs
[6563.38 → 6568.34] for the compute dies and the reason for that is that it's so flipping expensive it's cheaper
[6568.34 → 6578.02] to use a way larger die of an older node than it is to just shrink the Io to the using the same node as the
[6578.02 → 6585.78] compute dies that wasn't a thing 10 years ago you just shrunk you shrunk everything because it would
[6585.78 → 6591.14] all kind of come out in the wash like yeah it'd be more expensive per area or whatever, but you'd be
[6591.14 → 6598.82] able to pack so much more into the area that nothing else made any sense um yeah so snapdragon 8 elite
[6598.82 → 6607.78] got a die shrink and other CPUs have gotten small ones or not that much also like x86 CPUs are
[6607.78 → 6612.50] like so mature honestly I'm kind of impressed that we are still getting the performance gains for on a
[6612.50 → 6620.02] single core chip that we are like they can't scale clock speed any more um I don't know dozen 9000 is
[6620.02 → 6626.10] like pretty good right 800 x3d it's a heck of a chip it's still a beast it's a heck of a chip it's a
[6626.10 → 6630.74] questionable whether you need it I mean we demonstrated this pretty well in our video
[6630.74 → 6636.74] that if you're not running at 1080p low it doesn't make much of a difference and in fact we were
[6636.74 → 6642.02] so convinced by that we felt yeah we're we're good to go ahead with our 50 series reviews with
[6642.02 → 6647.38] the 7800 x3d because we're benchmarking these at 1440p and up and we just didn't see much of a
[6647.38 → 6652.26] difference we are planning on eventually moving that over yeah I just mean we didn't like freak out
[6652.26 → 6657.22] and panic upgrade everything without doing our due diligence yeah um because i you guys might
[6657.22 → 6662.74] remember this but we did it we put a ton of work into making sure that our parallelized test benches
[6662.74 → 6668.26] are all going to be are all going to give out results that are very close to each other and we
[6668.26 → 6673.54] needed over I think it was over a dozen 7800 CDs in order to nail that down before your time yeah I don't
[6673.54 → 6682.58] know it was a bunch though do you have any recommendations on restoring the finish on the
[6682.58 → 6688.74] black shaft screwdrivers nope that's why we only did them for a limited time because there's no way to do
[6688.74 → 6696.90] that and it was exactly these kinds of questions forever that I was trying to avoid the only reason
[6696.90 → 6703.70] we did it was because people demanded to have them in spite of us telling everyone look we can't, we're
[6703.70 → 6708.98] cancelling the black shaft because we can't guarantee the durability so some people really like it yeah
[6708.98 → 6715.54] well this person apparently doesn't yep know there 's's no way to restore it because like you'd have
[6715.54 → 6720.74] to get it perfect you'd want to like sandblast it or something, and you do not want to sandblast that
[6720.74 → 6723.94] screwdriver something's going to end up in the ratchet mechanism you do not want to do that
[6724.42 → 6731.94] shark plug the yeah that's probably what I do the diplomat says I love my black shaft
[6734.18 → 6740.50] very diplomatic um i I think if you plug the like socket end you might be able to someone
[6740.50 → 6746.90] mentioned in chat the socket plastic dip it but yeah oh um yeah it wouldn't look that good no and
[6747.46 → 6749.54] touching the knurling like plastic dip is just going to come off
[6752.58 → 6760.26] had to RMA a headphone four times in two years each replacement came with a new legal warranty this time
[6760.26 → 6767.22] they offer a goodwill instead of a warranty should I insist on my warranty or just switch brands this is uh
[6767.22 → 6775.06] oh man warranties why do I even talk about them why do I get baited into this stuff because I curated
[6775.06 → 6784.66] this one maybe I should just what do you think glens oh no I think that warranties are written
[6784.66 → 6790.50] in such a way that they basically leave enough room for interpretation that they are designed to
[6790.50 → 6797.70] protect the company rather than the user if you look carefully at any of them they will have clauses
[6797.70 → 6806.02] in there that say things like at discretion or regular wear and tear that will allow them to decide
[6806.02 → 6812.50] whether they give you warranty service or not so with all of that said the warranty service that
[6812.50 → 6818.58] you will get from a company functionally comes down to their willingness to stand behind their product
[6818.58 → 6823.46] but you should still get a warranty and I would, you know in this situation I would make it very clear
[6823.46 → 6827.14] that you're uncomfortable without one especially considering the failure rate that you've experienced
[6827.14 → 6832.58] thus far and then especially because most headphones really don't feel that much and then if they don't
[6833.46 → 6840.90] appease you if they don't satisfy you then yeah you should switch brands because at the end of the day
[6840.90 → 6846.26] whatever's written down on the warranty terms or whatever is what it is
[6846.26 → 6854.42] is, but it changes absolutely nothing about your experience and that's what matters their reputation
[6854.42 → 6860.02] matters your experience matters are they going to try and weasel out of it that's what matters
[6861.46 → 6865.54] and honestly after something failed that many times I would just be not that impressed anyway
[6867.30 → 6874.74] hello lan and Dan question for Luke I am a media student and I have pretty much been relying on
[6874.74 → 6881.06] AI for my programming assignments how do you think development will evolve in regard to AI that's
[6881.06 → 6887.38] going to be weird um there are things right now that it's like I've seen a ton of examples of people
[6887.38 → 6891.86] using I'm sure Dan's seen this too I've seen a ton of examples of people using the r1 model to do stuff
[6891.86 → 6897.94] that it's pretty good yeah they score really it scores really high on the programming um there's um
[6897.94 → 6900.50] there's a thing Wendell was sharing with me, I wonder if I can find it once like
[6903.14 → 6911.06] um where it like oh man I don't know the details, but it's an it's a genuinely wild um
[6912.42 → 6915.94] Reddit thread and they shared like their prompt, and it's just
[6918.10 → 6922.90] anyone could have prompted for this um I believe you can also feed it back code
[6922.90 → 6930.42] as examples, and it'll work on them yeah uh your phone needs to move yeah sorry oh is it going
[6930.42 → 6936.82] through yeah it's pretty bad I need to uh figure out how to solve this Adam z says the way he talks
[6936.82 → 6940.98] about warranty does North America not have laws mandating the minimum warranty rules and duration
[6940.98 → 6948.26] the issue is just that it costs so much to pursue it that it's very difficult to actually chase anybody
[6948.26 → 6954.10] on it that's that's the challenge it's not that it's not that you aren't entitled to if it's just
[6954.10 → 6960.66] that the cost of making someone deal with something is greater than what it would cost to just go buy a
[6960.66 → 6965.86] new one so it just usually doesn't make sense, but some people push it and there are laws in the states
[6965.86 → 6971.46] about it and stuff yeah of course get your warranty yeah honestly in that situation that was merch
[6971.46 → 6975.86] messaged about I would ask for like uh maybe you should give me a longer warranty because your product is sketch
[6975.86 → 6983.22] uh optimizes lamina do you want to come back to it Luke uh give me one second
[6991.78 → 6992.42] can I help you
[6995.38 → 7002.34] boom there it is he's got this am I good to go to your laptop yeah there we go this thread is wild
[7002.34 → 7007.62] uh diving through it is wild uh if you scroll this is a picture obviously but if you scroll down and
[7007.62 → 7017.54] find someone actually linked the um the actual GitHub repository and on there you can see the code
[7017.54 → 7025.30] that it wrote, and it shows the prompts um that they used oh what is this shorter I swear this is shorter
[7025.30 → 7031.14] oh never mind here's the example of the prompt that I used you can see like
[7034.26 → 7045.30] uh your task is to convert given c plus arm neon into this and okay, okay it just goes here's the
[7045.30 → 7046.26] function that you need to convert
[7049.14 → 7052.90] it's its this whole thing it's its going to be way too much for us to go over, and it's probably not
[7052.90 → 7056.50] going to be interesting for like the vast majority of the audience but check out this thread if you're
[7056.50 → 7063.14] interested in uh deep seek r1 helping with developer stuff oh check out this Dan's like yeah
[7063.14 → 7071.06] it's starting Luke you know how we were disenfranchised last year yeah I think we're back on the up and up
[7071.70 → 7079.22] yeah it makes the lama.CPP if I remember correctly yeah roughly 2x speed increase um a user even noticed
[7079.22 → 7086.66] there was something that it did that was not necessarily necessary, and they asked uh r1 about
[7086.66 → 7090.74] it, and it was like oh yeah you're correct you can remove it by doing these things blah blah blah
[7090.74 → 7096.02] like it improved beyond there so it's its improving and making code more efficient um
[7097.22 → 7102.98] and then able to work with someone giving it feedback to do stuff yeah one of the top comments
[7102.98 → 7110.98] self-improvement achieved um yeah there's a there's a comment here saying uh there's a non-zero chance
[7110.98 → 7115.70] that something like o3 pro is already influencing code optimizations inside open AI first mover
[7115.70 → 7120.50] advantage could be strong here as improvements compound and are magnified even further by
[7120.50 → 7125.94] possibly implementing r1 optimizations essentially what they're talking about here is if you have the
[7125.94 → 7132.74] most powerful model at a certain point you can use the most powerful model to continually self-improve
[7132.98 → 7137.54] faster than other people can especially if you don't release the most powerful model publicly the
[7137.54 → 7143.30] second you make it every time this is a similar concept to uh like ASIC coin yeah I was about to
[7143.30 → 7149.70] say this is basically ant miners yep it's its ASIC coin miners mining on their own machines before
[7149.70 → 7155.14] they release it to the public right like halfway through the next development cycle um in order to
[7155.14 → 7159.38] kind of always stay on top it's a fascinating conversation bite that's the company
[7159.38 → 7168.82] and yeah it's totally a thing um all right i if you're is you work for us, and you're hearing this
[7168.82 → 7177.30] and you're worried don't be we have roughly 47 000 years worth of work to do so if this accelerates
[7177.30 → 7184.42] you many times which I don't think we're there yet but if it does uh sweet there are more tasks don't
[7184.42 → 7192.02] worry about it um it begins yeah all right this year's going to be spicy hey Linus I recently wrecked
[7192.02 → 7198.34] my car oh bummer a 2003 Camry and I'm painting a new hood for it any problems just using a rattle
[7198.34 → 7205.30] can for a quick and dirty paint job any tips you'd suggest first um I do not condone graffiti
[7205.30 → 7214.42] you should not paint your hood second of all the most important thing is to clean it just make
[7214.42 → 7222.10] sure that the car is spotless so soap and water um rinse really, really well and then yeah
[7222.10 → 7228.02] realistically if all you want to do is prevent it from rusting just make sure you prime first or use
[7228.02 → 7233.62] a paint primer combination like this is an older car it sounds like you don't want to put a lot of money
[7233.62 → 7241.30] into it so yeah no it'll, it'll work make sure you coat everything right because if there's is there's
[7241.30 → 7246.18] any gaps then moisture will start to rust it and once rust gets under the paint then you have to
[7246.18 → 7251.38] understand the whole thing, and then you do a little thing again, but that's about it as someone closely
[7251.38 → 7257.22] familiar with people are expensive I was laid off this week what are your thoughts on companies that
[7257.22 → 7263.22] struggle due to the huge amount of misinformation perpetuated over and over oh I have lots of thoughts
[7263.22 → 7271.86] about that I'd like to apologize for Luke for two for tonight I'm just gonna I'm not
[7271.86 → 7286.50] answering this one go for it Luke you're up Asia Africa Australia North America what Antarctica what you're up
[7286.50 → 7293.78] oh you want to ding him again there we go good good good um I don't know I mean yeah it's
[7293.78 → 7298.50] really tough we in a lot of ways people have been talking about this for a while we're in like a semi
[7298.50 → 7308.58] like post truth scenario when everyone around basically has the same ability to voice things
[7308.58 → 7315.30] that has a lot of benefits and is cool but that means that every single person uh I'm not even talking
[7315.30 → 7321.38] about voting every single person's form of communication is taken at this at a very similar
[7321.38 → 7330.02] authority level which is kind of questionable in a few different ways and one person could create a
[7330.02 → 7338.10] huge range of accounts or run a LLM backed bought uh farm to communicate various things that they want
[7338.10 → 7342.90] we see this from nation states don't kid yourself it's also happening on a personal level
[7342.90 → 7349.30] a crafty high school kid with a laptop could figure it out this is not um this is not highly
[7349.30 → 7355.62] sophisticated at this point yeah like it's this is a thing, and it's happening you go around it's its
[7355.62 → 7360.82] public knowledge I'm not exactly a fan of twitter or x and in any of its iterations it has nothing to
[7360.82 → 7368.98] do with its curtain ownership um you go around it lately though it's a ghost town dude like I will look at a
[7368.98 → 7374.50] an at a tweet that has a lot or whatever they're called now that has a lot of interactions on it
[7374.50 → 7380.50] and you look at the like it has all likes retweets comments etc I have seen a couple where I like
[7380.50 → 7384.18] actually was just stunned for a while and then like shared it with someone else and was like look at this
[7384.82 → 7389.06] because there's like 40 responses and I pretty much guarantee none of them are real
[7389.86 → 7396.34] it's like wow like the whole what is it called again uh like uh dead internet theory or whatever
[7396.34 → 7400.50] dead internet yeah yeah it's like it's obviously not true there's an incredible amount of people
[7400.50 → 7407.86] that are chronically online but there is also just a mind-blowing amount of fake content on the internet
[7407.86 → 7414.34] these days fake people fake comments fake replies fake content the whole thing big problem is i actually
[7414.34 → 7423.78] mentioned this on the pre-show the human capacity or now augmented by the machine capacity for
[7423.78 → 7435.30] imagination yeah is much much much greater than responsible informed diligent people's capacity for
[7436.58 → 7448.34] finding formulating and presenting arguments against so it feels like a hopeless losing battle
[7448.34 → 7461.14] oh Linus the other week you mentioned playing lords of the realm 2 one of my favourite games from
[7461.14 → 7466.66] childhood have you heard of the new game manor lords I have I feel it's a spiritual successor to that game
[7466.66 → 7472.74] I haven't played it yet but I was lord of the realms just like popped up on like cheap games on steam and I was like hey
[7472.74 → 7478.74] hey, and it has made me want to try manor lords even more is manor lords still in early access though
[7478.74 → 7486.26] yes I was part of the first people to grab it as it came out yeah I'm i will um but I haven't yet
[7488.58 → 7494.02] very good is it good do you like it, I liked it did you play lords of the realm too I did not oh okay
[7494.02 → 7500.42] I think I should, it's surprising it's not very deep, but it is surprisingly still really fun you have to
[7500.42 → 7504.98] remember that it is still in early access so it will change over time yeah yeah yeah I mean i
[7504.98 → 7510.82] honestly I'm talking to the audience oh sure a lot of people think that early access games are
[7511.38 → 7516.66] done oh yeah they're not I've been I've been enjoying the heck out of an early access game tape
[7516.66 → 7525.54] to tape um dude it's so good yeah it's it definitely has problems like right now so many quirks right
[7525.54 → 7529.94] now breakaways are kind of broken and stuff like that like it's always got new problems because they're
[7529.94 → 7535.46] constantly working on it, but it is a ton of fun and I actually have really been enjoying what
[7535.46 → 7540.82] we did for the last run uh that we did together where instead it's gotten a lot better instead of
[7540.82 → 7550.26] choosing our path um at some of the like roguelike um roster building um forks we just flip a coin and
[7550.26 → 7555.14] then we just play with whatever we get um I've done a couple solo runs recently events are a lot more
[7555.14 → 7562.10] viable now where i um where I did the same thing and dude the one I did last night was just
[7562.10 → 7568.58] because I did it for everything including choosing my superstar choosing my initial ability so I just had
[7569.14 → 7577.86] garbage for everything it was unusable yeah that sounds pretty bad that sounds I mean it would be fun to
[7577.86 → 7584.82] challenge yourself to try to win that way, but yeah wow that's uh I got crushed by the knights' oh yeah
[7584.82 → 7589.46] just I mean that's a that's a wall already they rolled over me, it was really embarrassing while i
[7589.46 → 7594.98] say that's a wall already I really hope they don't nerf the princesses and the knights yeah the princesses
[7594.98 → 7600.34] and knights are they're they're they're brutal they're pretty steadily, but it is like I'm happy that
[7600.34 → 7605.30] that wall is there and not like immediately before the final boss or something because the final boss being
[7605.30 → 7610.26] a wall and the princesses and the knights being a wall is like okay this is fair this seems okay
[7610.90 → 7616.50] yeah it's super super super fun um i really hope that someday they make it so that you can
[7616.50 → 7623.54] properly just like both own copies of the game and play multiplayer um but as of right now and
[7623.54 → 7627.62] theoretically forever you can play with steam remote place only one person in your friend group needs
[7627.62 → 7630.98] to buy the game and then everyone else can steam remote play which is but if you really love it
[7630.98 → 7636.02] you should just all buy it yeah I'm just saying just saying just saying just saying
[7636.02 → 7639.54] just saying because there's always that like I want to play this new game but now I have to convince
[7639.54 → 7644.10] my entire friend group yeah, and now it's like no, no you totally don't have to yeah
[7646.66 → 7652.10] i LLD what is the technology or piece of equipment that you loved the idea of but never reached its
[7652.10 → 7662.58] potential or was abandoned because it didn't catch on NIA Oct NIA really yeah dude oh come on yeah dude
[7662.58 → 7669.70] come on look at this guy look at this dude look at this dude I know what a loser you got that thing
[7669.70 → 7678.10] on his head he's going nowhere in life the Oct NIA neural impulse actuator plus brain mouse demonstration
[7678.10 → 7686.34] pong Linus tech tips what a title yeah well it was a different time for SEO oh I used to have
[7686.34 → 7690.42] that keyboard was sick that keyboard was pretty sick that its predecessor was better
[7690.42 → 7695.46] in my opinion original g15 was better yeah that's the gen 2 but yeah look he's playing the game with
[7695.46 → 7703.06] his brain with his brain it doesn't look like he's using the facial muscle trick either so I think he
[7703.06 → 7708.58] was actually playing with his brain um but yeah it was cool i I played a call of duty match with it
[7708.58 → 7715.30] and ended up positive I used it for shooting and reloading i i I looked and moved with my
[7715.30 → 7721.30] mouse and my keyboard but I used it for shooting and reloading that was tough um I have always been a
[7721.30 → 7728.58] fan of alternative input methods I've always thought they're cool um and this is one of them you
[7728.58 → 7737.70] know when is this 14 years ago brain control let's go let's go I bought this from NCI I had no idea
[7737.70 → 7742.74] you had a video on it oh really yeah I don't think I knew you made videos at that point I don't think
[7742.74 → 7750.26] I'd been making videos for very long at that point that's true yeah you can see it like try to map
[7750.26 → 7756.50] out your brain waves then it uses thresholds of these different brain wave activations to create
[7756.50 → 7760.90] inputs so when I was messing with this back in the day I was lived in my parents house because I was
[7760.90 → 7767.14] in like high school I think yeah um and my parents or my brother or someone would come up to the
[7767.14 → 7771.30] computer desk and like talk to me and I'd be like trying to play some game or something and I'd look
[7771.30 → 7777.22] and go to talk to them and just everything starts happening because I'm my face is moving, and it used
[7777.22 → 7781.70] facial muscles as some of the inputs uh, and then you're also thinking about your response and all this
[7781.70 → 7787.46] kind of stuff you're not focused on the game any more so just everything would go nuts it was
[7787.46 → 7791.70] kind of funny because I'll like to beg people not to talk to me while I was playing with it because
[7791.70 → 7794.18] because everything just gets screwed up
[7796.26 → 7801.38] oh yeah anyway I would like proper advancements in this technology I think would have been really
[7801.38 → 7810.98] cool but anyway anything from you oh I thought you did a really great job okay I have nothing to add
[7810.98 → 7817.46] sounds good what's up my fellow winners Linus given the option would you ever replace any of
[7817.46 → 7822.90] your limbs or organs and become a cyborg I've been legally blind since I was 11 and have always dreamt
[7822.90 → 7834.02] of robot eyes yes absolutely but I don't think I would want to and still until it was like becoming a
[7834.02 → 7840.82] problem I never asked for this yeah i I think I'm on the same page because like I've known from
[7840.82 → 7845.70] very young that my knees are going to go probably pretty relatively young so that's one of the reasons
[7845.70 → 7852.98] that um I avoid high impact sports altogether I don't run so if I'm going to go out for a jog I've put
[7852.98 → 7863.38] on rollerblades like I do not jog um I'll bike I'll rollerblade I will elliptical I will um I'll go on
[7863.38 → 7868.98] the stairs stair master no problem but I'm not I'm not jogging I'm not running um imagine some bad
[7868.98 → 7875.14] winter movements aren't awesome for that I won't play at facilities I won't play at facilities that
[7875.14 → 7880.98] don't have um a cushioned floor yeah and I don't even mean just like a vinyl cushion or like
[7880.98 → 7887.38] a foam or whatever I mean like a proper sprung like dance floor or like a sprung floor um which
[7887.38 → 7894.18] makes a huge difference in terms of the impact, and so i I work to keep my knees strong but um you know
[7894.18 → 7898.74] I've known from very young that it runs thick in my family that my knees are probably going to fall
[7898.74 → 7905.86] apart in my 40s so um if I had the opportunity to put like way better ones in I wouldn't hesitate
[7905.86 → 7910.58] for a second I'd go for it if they were just like my original ones but like better
[7910.98 → 7918.42] and if I could do the same thing for things like uh vision as long as the risk is low I'd be I'd be
[7918.42 → 7923.14] pretty I'd be pretty stoked for it, I don't think I'd want to just jump on it but like similarly there's
[7923.14 → 7930.50] you know I've got some problems and if they crossed a line if I'm no longer able to do certain
[7930.50 → 7935.62] things or whatever yeah sure yeah of course from the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh
[7935.62 → 7945.14] it disgusted me what's that a quote from 40k okay and there's so yeah for sure but there's also
[7945.14 → 7950.10] variants of it from like everything oh absolutely yeah I wanted to go into biomedical engineering for
[7950.10 → 7956.58] a long time to kind of perpetuate the cybernetic things okay well I didn't know it was like quite
[7956.58 → 7964.10] that genesis 89 25 asks would you go full Borg we go full Borg yeah i I wouldn't here's my
[7964.10 → 7969.94] issue though is I would only want to live forever if everyone that I liked would also live forever
[7969.94 → 7974.90] and they wouldn't, they wouldn't do that they'd just be like nah so what I'm going to live forever by
[7974.90 → 7980.50] myself that's that's lame I'd go for it do you see a future where they become extremely common and then
[7980.50 → 7987.54] we start offering Ltd brand like replacement parts on Ltd store like you get Ltd store brand knees no
[7987.54 → 7993.22] but like the open source and maker community gets behind it, I got my new arm, and it's pink and orange
[7993.22 → 8000.90] and it's so cute lambo edition forearms baby maybe the cyberpunk future is not that bad if
[8000.90 → 8006.58] if open source and right to repair people are like still right to repair your body yeah that's one of
[8006.58 → 8011.94] the reasons I wanted to get into it so bad I'm going to own that we don't even do food stuffs on our store
[8011.94 → 8017.86] we don't even sell anything people ingest because of the liability concerns we're not going to do body parts
[8017.86 → 8022.26] why not we're not going to do body parts what do you mean you don't want people to have trusted me
[8022.26 → 8028.34] pro warranties on their other literal legs well what I literally don't want to do is be responsible
[8028.34 → 8033.86] for someone's broken legs yeah, but you just replace them they could just get new ones you don't have
[8033.86 → 8037.94] to worry about your legs breaking because you just get new ones that's the whole point of it my son's
[8037.94 → 8046.10] legs malfunctioned, and he ran off a cliff I would like to warranty my son please it's gonna cost
[8046.10 → 8051.30] ten thousand dollars for his new back that has to come out of your luckily it's the cyberpunk
[8051.30 → 8054.66] future so you can realistically just replace everything so it's fine yeah I had to print a
[8054.66 → 8059.94] new kid this sucks you owe me 45 dollars
[8063.30 → 8066.10] I'm going to leave you a negative review on our Google mind palace
[8067.94 → 8081.86] I dream of the future a lot if you can tell hi opalines prime bumblebee Luke and Megatron Dan
[8081.86 → 8087.22] as a product company I'm interested in your insight on what I assume are insane logistics for companies
[8087.22 → 8093.86] with major annual releases for example phones or games I would hate to be responsible for making sure
[8093.86 → 8099.54] that there are enough iPhones on September the whatever yeah like honestly I had someone it's
[8099.54 → 8105.70] not that hard for you NVIDIA i think it was on Reddit someone was asking me um you know hey
[8105.70 → 8112.34] what's up with you guys like shipping your backpacks and waves like after you launch and I'm like i I am
[8112.34 → 8120.18] not apple like this is this may surprise our regular viewers but in the grand scheme of things we are a
[8120.18 → 8127.62] pretty small company um so when we launch a new product that we conceivably could sell tens of
[8127.62 → 8135.22] thousands of units of it is not manageable for our cash flow to just like like like make all of it that
[8135.22 → 8143.54] we could possibly ever need to distribute it globally and then build up with our production capacity build up
[8143.54 → 8148.10] stock levels such that on launch day everyone who could possibly want one can buy one and get it
[8148.10 → 8155.62] immediately it's just not viable and so you know you look at some of the world's most successful
[8155.62 → 8161.54] companies and what they actually do really well it's like is apple a technology company yeah but
[8162.66 → 8166.82] they could be the greatest technology company in the world, and they wouldn't be worth trillions of
[8166.82 → 8174.66] dollars what they are is a logistics and operations company the fact that they execute what they do with
[8174.66 → 8183.30] the kind of precision that they do is honestly as impressive as what they do technologically if not
[8183.30 → 8188.18] more so sometimes some of the tech stuff they do is really cool man you've seen the tandem OLED iPad
[8189.46 → 8200.50] but man the logistics of it is incredibly incredible like just go to some other country and like walk into an Apple Store be like
[8200.50 → 8209.54] think about how hard it is to train any one person to do anything go to some other country and just be
[8209.54 → 8217.70] walk into an Apple Store, and you're like oh this is an Apple Store but on Français how did they how'd
[8217.70 → 8223.06] they do that that's incredible I think it's crazy that like it's incredible you can get uh a can of coke like
[8223.06 → 8229.14] almost quite literally anywhere in the world like yeah like that's like wow wild like yeah it's its
[8229.14 → 8235.78] worthless sugar water so are they a beverage company no they have agreements with people to
[8235.78 → 8239.38] keep it cold they're a sales and logistics company, and it's incredible
[8241.70 → 8249.94] yeah last one I got for you today hey Dan's and those on when Linus I have an ongoing bet that the GTA
[8249.94 → 8256.50] six will release prior to you painting and finishing the bike impossible I will do it
[8257.86 → 8264.26] have you made any progress yes I don't have any pictures uh oh hold on where's my phone
[8268.10 → 8276.02] I got it there's a phone in your back pocket there's a what now oh uh that's uh it doesn't have a sim in
[8276.02 → 8282.74] it right now um my wife let's find out if she's at home Ben Mitchell said in some parts of Mexico you
[8282.74 → 8289.54] can only buy coke not water, and it's also cheaper I actually knew that that's absurd I think I've talked
[8289.54 → 8297.22] before about how I just wanted to work for McDonald's um could I ask you a favour Mary
[8301.30 → 8306.50] do you mind teaming Dan a couple pictures of the like bike progress
[8306.50 → 8321.46] okay Evan is gonna teams Dan some pictures of bike progress so i will show you guys I will
[8321.46 → 8327.62] show you really progress nice you will probably not be very impressed because it really does not look
[8327.62 → 8331.22] like much right now, but it's its something it's something
[8335.46 → 8337.14] oh it doesn't end as a new one
[8340.90 → 8347.94] hello like this cynicism and Daniel lioness as someone with experience can you give any advice on how
[8348.50 → 8352.90] one might perform a hostile takeover of the company they work for asking for a friend
[8352.90 → 8360.82] I never took over NCI the only thing that I did was I bought the intellectual property
[8361.38 → 8367.94] slash assets that were the Linus tech tips YouTube channel and Linus tech tips.com which at the time
[8367.94 → 8378.42] was like a barely active blog and then later with some help became the LTT forum um so it really it was
[8378.42 → 8386.58] me negotiating the purchase of an asset um not really orchestrating any kind of like
[8386.58 → 8396.02] company takeover now I would love to collect what remains of the skeleton of NCI and breathe new
[8396.02 → 8403.14] life into it that would actually that would actually be super cool um pretty sick it would be super cool
[8403.14 → 8411.62] but up until now we have not been able to reach uh an agreement that has been mutually agreed upon
[8411.62 → 8416.82] by all parties who would need to be involved in it so interesting because over time its value
[8419.46 → 8426.42] rapidly approaches zero yeah what value would it have to literally anyone other than you right now
[8426.42 → 8432.90] very little I can't think of literally anything like it's a four-letter
[8432.90 → 8438.34] dot com, but it's like a gobbledygook four-letter dot com like it's nothing also people don't care
[8438.34 → 8444.18] any more oh dude the NCI brand is no I don't mean the brand oh I don't think people care about four
[8444.18 → 8450.42] letter domains oh interesting people are typing in dot come yeah yeah oh yeah you're probably right
[8450.42 → 8456.66] apps and searches it's not yeah no one cares anymore I mean they still cost money of course, but it's not
[8456.66 → 8462.66] like it used to be where you used to be prestigious you could camp a domain and literally the value of
[8462.66 → 8470.90] it would be parabolic over time yeah got your picks x.com though yeah and no one cares yeah which is my
[8470.90 → 8477.38] point my silent protest every time I go to that site is I type twitter.com yeah sure because it's
[8477.38 → 8483.38] actually not like so I'll say your browser is just going to auto complete yeah like i really the short
[8483.38 → 8489.22] domain thing like it's still cool and like some old heads will see it and be like oh sweet but like
[8489.22 → 8495.78] and he says and me in float plane chat says years ago I saw people type Facebook login instead of
[8495.78 → 8502.74] facebook.com into it yeah yeah yeah it's it doesn't matter any more so like your domain is unimportant
[8502.74 → 8508.58] it doesn't matter now your brand name got trashed on the way out anyway and no one cares and
[8508.58 → 8514.90] it's been a long time and everyone's forgotten so like I haven't forgotten yeah I would like to
[8514.90 → 8521.38] bring back but again other than you, it doesn't have value to anyone I also don't think anyone else
[8521.38 → 8526.66] would really have a shot at it do anything with it yeah what would we do with it
[8529.14 → 8532.18] I already know but body parts yeah what would you do let's stop
[8532.18 → 8539.78] so legs uh like Linus it's the new frontier yeah nobody wants leg everyone's trying to get rid of
[8539.78 → 8546.82] leg uh ah but okay if is computer starts getting less interesting there it is oh if computers start
[8546.82 → 8552.10] getting less interesting you could start reviewing body parts no we're not gonna we're not
[8552.10 → 8556.34] going to use it for reviews why review a monitor when you could review a cybernetic eye yeah we have to get
[8556.34 → 8565.30] over this cake-less thing that's happened return Linus's cake cybernetic cake 2024 Linus cake is uh
[8565.30 → 8572.74] this year's model is way worse more Linus less cake a lot less firm this year let's look at motorbike
[8572.74 → 8578.10] pictures all right let's look at some of the pictures some depleted mass okay, so these are these
[8578.10 → 8586.02] are testers um the finished colour is going to be the one that's in the bottom right so that's the
[8586.02 → 8592.02] same pink that is in the top left but with the effect layer that's on the top right over top of it
[8593.46 → 8599.54] okay I feel like I like the top left one most, but the lighting on this is also yes it's suspect yeah it's
[8599.54 → 8607.54] suspect uh so here's some primed plastic parts and as well as my primed wheels uh one or two of them
[8607.54 → 8612.90] need some sanding and maybe a quick re-attempt at the priming but um they're they're pretty okay
[8614.26 → 8619.06] and that is the front um bloody hell uh fairing
[8621.54 → 8627.62] and that is that's it that's all I got okay
[8630.42 → 8637.06] jeez and I guess I got one more merch message and then that's about it yo how do you guys measure
[8637.06 → 8641.70] input latency I stream to my stream deck and latency is completely negligible for most games
[8641.70 → 8648.42] but others I think I barely notice can't tell if it's in my head or not do we have um there's
[8648.42 → 8654.90] actually uh there's actually an uh an overlay for depending what streaming thing you're using there
[8654.90 → 8662.58] should be an overlay that shows you what your latency is I can promise you it is not um negligible
[8662.58 → 8667.94] but depending on the games you're playing it can be way less noticeable so tape to tape for example
[8667.94 → 8675.70] everybody remote plays in, and it's pretty great um so hold on a second they are they're talking about
[8675.70 → 8680.10] like in-home streaming though yeah, but they asked how do we measure it and I thought it was interesting
[8680.10 → 8685.70] there's an article in the labs written by ONI with jams and Antoine doing the, and they did ask
[8685.70 → 8690.10] how we do it and this is how labs conducts tests on mice and if you scroll down a little bit they have
[8690.10 → 8693.78] the latency and sensor test section this is a very cool article check it out yeah
[8696.66 → 8703.54] all right that's mostly it for the show, but there is a quick last thing uh I did end up watching some
[8703.54 → 8711.14] of lewis's video that he uploaded shortly before the wan show last week um I don't think I made through
[8711.14 → 8718.90] quite as much of it as dr IAN buttress did um yeah he got through 20 minutes before deciding it was
[8718.90 → 8726.82] quote not worth the mental effort um what I saw so far seems to be a classic bad faith assume the
[8726.82 → 8734.58] absolute worst load of frankly um the main premise for his medical diagnosis of me with a personality
[8734.58 → 8741.54] disorder appears to be that I can never admit when I'm wrong but my first interaction with this man
[8741.54 → 8749.30] was to admit that I was wrong in public and cordially invite him to collaborate so that we could correct
[8749.30 → 8759.94] the record in front of 2.2 million people literally this is the first interaction we ever have where i
[8759.94 → 8769.22] say I was wrong show me the right way to do it so that I can show my viewers um there's also a bit in
[8769.22 → 8775.06] here about how I intentionally texted the wrong number for Steve no of course it wasn't intentional
[8775.06 → 8781.54] um you'd be in a difficult mental state too in that situation but this is going to just blow
[8781.54 → 8786.02] up the narrative I'm going to take that feedback and get that mistake removed and or we'll add the
[8786.02 → 8793.22] context that while yes Steve does have the number active he primaries a different number anyway maybe
[8793.22 → 8798.26] there's an appropriate time and place to address the rest of this stuff but you all are clearly tired of
[8798.26 → 8803.70] hearing about it here so we're going to see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[8805.70 → 8824.10] bye that was my cybernetic arm I liked it I had to run the wave function
[8828.26 → 8833.70] bye
[8833.70 → 8835.70] you
[8835.70 → 8837.70] you
[8837.70 → 8839.70] you
[8839.70 → 8841.70] you
[8841.70 → 8843.70] you
[8843.70 → 8845.70] you
