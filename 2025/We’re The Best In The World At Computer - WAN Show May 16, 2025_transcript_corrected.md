[0.00 → 7.44] It's WAN Showtime, and I, for one, am ticked, teed, peeved, irate.
[7.98 → 9.56] How can they do this?
[9.82 → 12.18] We've got a lot of great topics for you guys this week,
[12.48 → 18.50] starting of course with VPN Secure cancelling lifetime subscriptions
[18.50 → 21.46] because they didn't know about them.
[22.36 → 24.88] What does that even mean?
[24.88 → 30.22] Oh, oh, oh, in much better news, we are officially the best at computer.
[30.50 → 31.04] That's right.
[31.24 → 33.88] We have this Guinness World Record to show that we compute red
[34.46 → 38.34] more than anybody ever compute red before, along with our partner Peoria.
[38.66 → 41.94] Talking a little bit about the behind the scenes of that, how that came to pass.
[41.98 → 42.70] What else we got?
[44.46 → 49.74] Philips debuts 3D printable repair components for Philips products,
[49.82 → 52.24] which is cool and rather surprising.
[52.24 → 56.82] And also, apparently podcasters don't want public play counts.
[58.40 → 62.16] So I guess Phil plane is very feature first on this one.
[62.18 → 63.10] I think I know why.
[63.30 → 63.98] I know why.
[64.78 → 66.66] Oh, people are upset I didn't say welcome to the WAN Show.
[66.78 → 67.98] Welcome to the WAN Show!
[67.98 → 68.00] Welcome to the WAN Show!
[82.24 → 86.86] It's been so many years since we actually sat on a couch.
[88.50 → 88.94] Yeah.
[89.18 → 93.26] The show is brought to you today by Messi, Delete Me, and Squarespace.
[93.64 → 97.84] Of course, alongside our rap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Dell,
[97.96 → 101.48] and our chair partner, oops, Secret Lab.
[102.18 → 106.08] Technically, it was only a little bit over a year because of the April Fool's stream.
[106.08 → 107.14] Oh, I guess that's fair.
[107.26 → 107.86] That is true.
[108.02 → 108.26] Haha!
[108.90 → 112.16] Yeah, Chewy was there fact-checking us, fact-checking us live.
[112.16 → 112.92] Oh, he said it too!
[113.92 → 114.16] Nice.
[114.22 → 118.50] Let's jump right into our headline topic, which is, of course,
[118.88 → 123.44] a lot of you in the comments on today's video on us getting,
[123.62 → 125.52] yes, my friends, it is real.
[125.52 → 128.48] The number of people that I saw being like, I thought it was a bit.
[128.98 → 130.32] I thought it was like a bit.
[130.42 → 131.08] No, no, no, no, no.
[131.24 → 131.66] No, no, no.
[131.72 → 135.08] It's 300 trillion bits.
[136.22 → 137.44] That's right, my friends.
[138.06 → 138.82] Thank you, Dan.
[139.28 → 144.86] We actually did get the verified Guinness World Record
[144.86 → 147.90] for calculating the most accurate value of pi,
[148.04 → 153.02] which was to 300 trillion decimal places.
[153.02 → 160.60] And I only vaguely remember how this came to be,
[160.76 → 165.40] but Luke, I kind of want to hear a little bit about how Infra has felt about this project
[165.40 → 170.60] that has been, as far as I can tell, very much in the way
[170.60 → 175.72] of things that they've been trying to do over the last, I would say, months,
[175.82 → 177.46] but realistically, it's been more like years.
[178.32 → 179.88] Yeah, and loud.
[179.88 → 187.36] I will tell you that the project started in the same way that a lot of projects start around here.
[187.86 → 191.98] And you guys probably remember back when we did the million-dollar PC.
[192.38 → 195.04] So we had these GPU compute nodes,
[195.32 → 199.86] and realistically, it was the oodles and oodles of high-speed PCIe storage
[199.86 → 202.04] that made it so expensive.
[202.04 → 209.18] So we showed, you know, what a, you know, data centre class node could actually be used for.
[209.30 → 211.88] I believe we did some simulations on it and stuff like that.
[211.94 → 217.50] We showed how high-speed storage is so important to powering these kinds of workloads.
[217.74 → 221.60] And then we were done with it, and everybody wanted their hardware back,
[221.86 → 224.86] which made us kind of go reasonable.
[224.86 → 226.86] But hear me out.
[227.74 → 235.14] What if we keep the hardware, and since we've got it, we do something really cool with it?
[235.52 → 242.20] So whenever we get our hands on something that enables something that almost nobody else in the world could do,
[242.64 → 247.92] we are highly incentivized to try to do more stuff with that hardware.
[247.92 → 254.30] Not because there's actually, like, a compelling business reason for us to have had that stuff lying around.
[254.52 → 261.12] As far as I can tell, we have done absolutely nothing of use with the million-dollar PC
[261.12 → 263.50] in the entire time that we've had it.
[264.36 → 269.98] And the majority of that time has been to try and get this project going,
[270.06 → 273.54] which ended up being a huge challenge.
[273.54 → 277.26] Jake was, uh, Jake, I don't know if he ended up putting it in the final edit,
[277.26 → 280.62] because I saw a version of the edit that I signed off on,
[280.68 → 281.90] and I think we made some more changes.
[282.34 → 289.16] But basically, he has this spreadsheet where he went through, like, every unable in Y Cruncher,
[289.44 → 292.26] and basically did, like, before, after, before, after, before, after, before.
[292.34 → 295.42] Like, it is the most flipping tuned Y Cruncher.
[295.44 → 297.68] Not because Y Cruncher's not good already,
[297.68 → 304.10] but because, as far as we can tell, nobody has ever used it quite like this
[304.10 → 307.60] with network-distributed storage in this fashion.
[309.18 → 311.24] So that's how the whole thing started.
[311.38 → 316.92] We were like, hey, we should try to find something else to do with this super-powerful hardware.
[316.92 → 322.82] Why don't we calculate more digits of pi?
[324.28 → 326.24] We kind of glossed over it in the video,
[326.44 → 329.48] but keeping this thing fed has been an absolute nightmare.
[329.62 → 332.04] And I want to, I want to, before, before Luke jumps in,
[332.06 → 335.30] I want to address one more thing that I saw a lot of in the comments,
[335.38 → 339.42] and that is, wow, your infrastructure in Canada must be s***
[339.42 → 341.42] if you guys lose power that often.
[341.42 → 343.02] Okay, a couple of things.
[343.30 → 349.18] First, in this area in particular, yeah, it does kind of feel that way.
[349.70 → 354.86] Dude, we lose power at the office alarmingly frequently,
[355.24 → 357.52] especially given that this is an industrial zone,
[357.78 → 360.26] one that they are moving a hospital into.
[360.60 → 366.10] They are literally building a hospital across the street from labs,
[366.56 → 368.16] like, right there.
[368.16 → 371.26] And we have lost power, I kid you not,
[371.34 → 375.06] like, somewhere between half a dozen and ten times in the last calendar year.
[375.36 → 377.20] It has been unbelievable.
[377.94 → 379.04] With that said...
[379.04 → 380.04] Well, I was...
[380.04 → 381.26] Sorry, this is delayed today.
[381.26 → 383.40] At a certain point in my growing up,
[383.62 → 389.22] we lived on the same grid as the hospital
[389.22 → 392.08] that we were near at one point in time,
[392.44 → 395.28] and you would just never lose power.
[395.28 → 396.58] Like, the whole...
[396.58 → 399.32] Everyone else would lose power, and we would be fine forever.
[399.46 → 402.18] And then that stopped being a thing, and it was a sad day.
[402.26 → 403.02] It's all about priority.
[403.90 → 407.74] Yeah, I've also found that, oddly enough, for some reason,
[407.78 → 409.80] you're talking about how the surrounding infrastructure isn't that great,
[410.16 → 413.62] I find I lose power less than the office does.
[413.72 → 414.72] Oh, dude, this area...
[414.72 → 418.52] Like, my current residential setup is more resilient than the office area.
[418.52 → 419.60] This area is the pits.
[419.60 → 425.62] However, in their defence, there is kind of a good reason for it.
[425.98 → 431.76] This part of the lower mainland is quite built out, but not built up.
[432.04 → 433.66] So it's quite spread out.
[433.74 → 434.72] It kind of sprawls.
[435.22 → 437.36] And our power lines, because of that,
[437.72 → 442.02] were cost-effectively constructed on wooden poles, right?
[442.12 → 444.80] So our power poles and our telephone poles,
[444.90 → 446.64] they kind of share infrastructure,
[447.10 → 449.04] and they're just overhead power lines.
[449.04 → 450.90] So if you've ever been to Vancouver,
[451.38 → 454.66] you might know that we are known for having...
[454.66 → 457.50] for not just levelling all the trees in our cities,
[457.70 → 459.08] which is nice.
[459.64 → 462.22] You know, beautiful even, you might say.
[462.44 → 465.14] Beautiful British Columbia, that's what it says on our license plates.
[465.90 → 467.92] But it is a bit of a double-edged sword,
[468.20 → 471.10] and when we have a windstorm, which, hey, you know,
[471.26 → 472.64] just like the rest of the world,
[472.90 → 475.90] seems to be happening a lot more frequently around here these days,
[475.90 → 480.18] I wonder if there's some kind of thing that might be contributing to that.
[480.28 → 480.70] I don't know.
[480.76 → 481.52] It's a great mystery,
[481.52 → 485.06] at least for, you know, half of the world that can't figure it out.
[486.00 → 489.18] We're having a lot more windstorms lately than we used to,
[489.18 → 492.98] and so branches and trees are coming down on those power lines
[492.98 → 495.34] a lot more than they used to.
[495.44 → 501.66] So our infrastructure was designed for the very mild climate
[501.66 → 503.30] that we used to have,
[503.52 → 507.68] and the very mild storms that we used to have,
[507.68 → 512.48] and now our climate tends to dip lower in lows during the winter,
[512.74 → 515.42] get higher in the highs during the summer,
[515.54 → 517.58] and we tend to have a lot more windstorms.
[517.60 → 521.60] So it's been a learning curve, I guess,
[521.76 → 525.08] is what I would say.
[525.40 → 526.96] That doesn't mean I'm happy about it.
[527.14 → 529.84] It wasn't great that we lost power a bunch of times
[529.84 → 531.30] during the pie attempt,
[531.42 → 534.36] and also just generally lose power a lot.
[534.70 → 536.84] It's pretty inconvenient for business operations,
[536.84 → 538.38] but overall,
[538.78 → 542.14] I don't think it's slowed us down too much over the years.
[542.38 → 544.04] Okay, so what have you guys gone through?
[544.10 → 546.56] Because there's been cooling failures, power failures,
[547.08 → 548.90] just generally us being up in your biz.
[549.26 → 551.84] Like, infra must be not that stoked on this project, hey?
[552.98 → 555.22] Dan might have more to comment here than me,
[555.32 → 558.56] but honestly, that's those same things, basically,
[558.88 → 561.40] because in a few cases,
[561.40 → 563.80] we've been called and tried to help with that sound.
[563.80 → 568.80] And even with the actually fairly extensive sound deadening
[568.80 → 570.80] that that room has on it,
[572.16 → 573.58] the infra team has sat,
[573.74 → 575.38] especially Thomas,
[576.14 → 577.68] has sat right next to it.
[578.68 → 580.84] And straight through all that sound deadening,
[581.00 → 582.94] it's been real loud
[582.94 → 585.50] and screaming real hard the whole time.
[585.50 → 589.20] I got some notes from Jake here.
[589.26 → 590.60] I mentioned that this is going to be a topic,
[590.72 → 592.18] and asked if there's anything he wanted to add.
[592.98 → 593.32] He said,
[593.38 → 595.52] don't pick the cheapest HVAC quote.
[596.74 → 598.76] He said that a lot of people were commenting on
[598.76 → 601.16] asking how it was actually verified,
[601.34 → 604.20] or if we just calculated 300 trillion digits of nothing.
[604.76 → 605.54] But apparently,
[605.66 → 608.84] it's something called BBP extraction,
[608.84 → 612.54] or Bailey-Corwin-Ploof extraction,
[612.84 → 617.02] where you can calculate specific ranges of digits
[617.02 → 618.40] instead of the whole thing.
[619.82 → 621.94] So Alexander Yee,
[622.02 → 622.92] the Y-Cruncher dev,
[623.00 → 624.84] ran two separate BBP verifications
[625.46 → 627.04] against the last chunk of digits
[627.04 → 628.20] in hex form to validate.
[628.84 → 630.90] And this took around six hours each
[630.90 → 632.62] on a very fast computer.
[632.76 → 633.64] So apparently, no,
[633.70 → 634.88] you don't have to run the whole thing twice.
[634.88 → 637.80] And it gets spot-checked
[637.80 → 639.80] against the existing record sets,
[640.20 → 642.80] including $202 trillion
[642.80 → 644.58] and $100 trillion from Google, etc.
[646.64 → 647.64] And yeah,
[647.78 → 649.72] Jake is also saying that he could run over to the set
[649.72 → 651.68] and add some context or questions,
[651.76 → 652.50] which could be cool.
[652.72 → 653.14] Sure, yeah.
[653.24 → 655.50] No, this has been Jake's pet project
[655.50 → 658.00] for over a year at this point,
[658.10 → 659.36] getting it over the line.
[659.94 → 664.00] It's amazing how dedicated that young man can be.
[664.00 → 666.38] when the objective is purely
[666.38 → 668.92] to create the world's largest peen.
[672.92 → 674.20] That makes a lot of sense.
[674.36 → 675.98] For quite literally no purpose
[675.98 → 679.42] other than to have the biggest computer peen.
[681.84 → 684.90] I'm not saying he doesn't work hard on other stuff.
[685.00 → 686.06] In fact, someone,
[686.54 → 688.44] Casper Explore in the float plane chat says,
[688.50 → 689.82] hey, I thought you guys just made a video
[689.82 → 691.74] about Dying battery backup.
[692.16 → 693.52] Battery backup the lab?
[694.16 → 694.96] He's been trying,
[695.04 → 696.90] he's actually been trying to get me
[696.90 → 699.86] to do like a massive power backup project here
[699.86 → 701.56] for quite some time.
[701.66 → 702.76] And yes,
[703.14 → 704.80] the like weird,
[705.08 → 706.04] we know it's
[706.04 → 709.10] at least a little bit sketchy
[709.10 → 711.02] setup that I have at my house right now
[711.02 → 713.48] was meant to be stage one.
[714.00 → 715.92] Stage two is hopefully like
[715.92 → 716.90] a bigger setup
[716.90 → 718.24] at my house
[718.24 → 719.90] because that's still
[719.90 → 721.20] a manageable scale.
[721.62 → 723.70] And if these projects continue
[723.70 → 724.92] to pique people's interest,
[725.42 → 726.92] stage three could be
[726.92 → 728.08] a larger,
[728.26 → 729.76] more resilient solution
[729.76 → 731.22] that's here at the office.
[731.22 → 732.32] So, you know,
[732.44 → 733.00] never,
[733.16 → 734.64] never underestimate,
[735.50 → 736.66] never underestimate
[736.66 → 737.78] this young man,
[737.84 → 738.86] whether he's doing something
[738.86 → 739.70] actually useful,
[739.70 → 740.60] like, you know,
[740.80 → 741.84] Dying a UPS
[741.84 → 743.22] for a fraction of the cost
[743.22 → 744.52] or whether he's
[744.52 → 747.28] doing this.
[749.42 → 750.60] Yeah, yeah.
[750.60 → 753.84] I don't know.
[753.98 → 755.36] I know he's in the chat right now
[755.36 → 756.46] if people have questions
[756.46 → 757.80] over in float plane chat.
[758.94 → 759.88] He's coming over.
[760.00 → 760.32] Oh, is he?
[760.38 → 760.56] Okay.
[761.20 → 761.98] He's going to join you.
[762.10 → 762.94] Isaac V asks,
[763.06 → 764.20] why not a diesel generator
[764.20 → 765.38] so you guys can keep going?
[765.46 → 766.50] Maybe a more proven way
[766.50 → 766.96] for business.
[767.10 → 767.26] So,
[767.74 → 768.74] a diesel generator
[768.74 → 770.04] is not as simple
[770.04 → 770.74] as just like
[770.74 → 772.18] buy a diesel generator.
[772.56 → 773.50] You have to actually like
[773.50 → 774.78] make sure the diesel fuel
[774.78 → 775.70] doesn't go bad.
[775.78 → 776.58] Like when we checked out
[776.58 → 777.46] Equinix's setup,
[777.90 → 779.20] they had to have
[779.20 → 780.10] like their own
[780.10 → 781.52] fuel conditioning
[781.52 → 782.36] I think it's called
[782.36 → 783.32] but basically like
[783.32 → 784.82] to rejuvenate the fuel
[784.82 → 785.52] on site
[785.52 → 786.04] and make sure
[786.04 → 787.14] that it doesn't go bad
[787.14 → 789.24] in their storage tanks
[789.24 → 790.54] that like tanks
[790.54 → 791.10] are underground
[791.10 → 792.28] but also like
[792.28 → 793.20] they have like
[793.20 → 794.14] I think they have like
[794.14 → 795.22] counterweight or something
[795.22 → 796.04] so they don't like
[796.04 → 796.92] float in a flood
[796.92 → 797.16] or what
[797.16 → 798.04] like it's not
[798.04 → 801.86] it's not that simple
[801.86 → 803.56] to do an entire building
[803.56 → 804.46] diesel backup
[804.46 → 805.34] and it does
[805.34 → 806.42] take ongoing maintenance
[806.42 → 807.70] and the
[807.70 → 808.54] the actual
[808.54 → 810.08] business disruption
[810.08 → 811.28] of our occasional
[811.28 → 812.06] power outages
[812.06 → 813.10] is not
[813.10 → 813.58] pretty low
[813.58 → 815.44] that high
[815.44 → 816.88] like if it goes out
[816.88 → 817.92] for an hour or two
[817.92 → 818.82] we can just be like
[818.82 → 819.62] okay well
[819.62 → 820.50] um
[820.50 → 822.70] realistically
[822.70 → 823.52] all we can do
[823.52 → 824.64] is lean or clean
[824.64 → 825.70] so find one of those
[825.70 → 826.42] things to do
[826.42 → 827.48] um
[827.48 → 827.88] and
[827.88 → 829.24] a lot of the time
[829.24 → 830.30] it's out overnight
[830.30 → 831.26] like it's
[831.26 → 832.16] it hasn't
[832.16 → 833.92] you have to do
[833.92 → 834.96] a business
[834.96 → 836.56] like cost analysis
[836.56 → 837.82] um
[837.82 → 839.18] okay if you guys
[839.18 → 839.94] have questions
[839.94 → 840.66] Jake's going to sit
[840.66 → 841.26] in Luke's chair
[841.26 → 842.42] you're going to go around
[842.42 → 843.98] okay he's going to go
[843.98 → 844.54] around the back
[844.54 → 845.72] I mean that's a path
[845.72 → 847.20] that's a path
[847.20 → 848.18] that people can take
[848.18 → 848.38] it's
[848.38 → 848.64] i
[848.64 → 850.22] I tried to warn him
[850.22 → 852.80] he could have just
[852.80 → 854.10] quickly passed in front
[854.10 → 854.66] of this camera
[854.66 → 855.30] but instead

[913.36 → 913.82] adapter
[913.82 → 915.08] are we allowed to talk
[915.08 → 916.30] about the load
[916.30 → 916.94] of utter horse
[916.94 → 918.24] that getting one
[918.24 → 919.00] of these certificates
[919.00 → 919.78] is these days
[919.78 → 921.66] I don't know
[921.66 → 922.20] that
[922.20 → 923.00] is this on
[923.00 → 923.94] can you hear me
[923.94 → 924.28] through here
[924.28 → 925.22] I can, I can't hear
[925.22 → 925.88] you through here
[925.88 → 926.38] look mom
[926.38 → 927.40] I can hear you
[927.40 → 927.90] um
[927.90 → 929.10] I don't know
[929.10 → 929.84] that I want
[929.84 → 930.46] to do that
[930.46 → 932.32] okay because
[932.32 → 933.50] i have to tell you
[933.50 → 934.40] it was a lot of work
[934.40 → 934.70] though
[934.70 → 935.50] I'll tell you this
[935.50 → 936.02] much okay
[936.02 → 937.12] the process
[937.12 → 938.06] of getting the
[938.06 → 938.54] certificate
[938.54 → 939.62] is definitely
[939.62 → 940.30] different
[940.30 → 941.40] from what the
[941.40 → 942.30] process was
[942.30 → 943.22] back when we did
[943.22 → 943.94] highlander
[943.94 → 944.76] like almost
[944.76 → 945.48] 10 years ago
[945.48 → 946.28] it's also very
[946.28 → 946.90] different if you're
[946.90 → 947.74] doing it for like
[947.74 → 950.34] I'm a personal
[950.34 → 951.60] record I'm like
[951.60 → 952.82] I'm on my
[952.82 → 953.22] calculator
[953.22 → 954.56] the most bananas
[954.56 → 955.44] finding pie
[955.44 → 956.50] in a minute or
[956.50 → 957.32] something I don't
[957.32 → 958.00] know yeah yeah
[958.00 → 959.22] or reciting pie
[959.22 → 960.06] from your brain
[960.06 → 962.14] um you don't
[962.14 → 962.82] usually I think you
[962.82 → 963.52] don't have to pay
[963.52 → 964.30] money, or it's not a
[964.30 → 965.64] very large amount
[965.64 → 966.24] of money but when
[966.24 → 966.78] you're doing something
[966.78 → 967.34] that's corporate
[967.34 → 968.64] it's advertising
[968.64 → 971.92] so they expect to
[971.92 → 972.84] get paid for it
[972.84 → 975.20] and um
[975.20 → 976.10] and a lot
[976.10 → 977.50] yeah not 300
[977.50 → 979.32] 300 trillion digits
[979.32 → 980.62] of paid but
[980.62 → 982.34] more than two
[982.34 → 983.14] there's a password
[983.14 → 983.82] on this laptop
[983.82 → 984.88] more than three
[984.88 → 985.88] I don't know
[985.88 → 986.36] can you get
[986.36 → 986.90] can you get
[986.90 → 987.40] multiple
[987.40 → 988.62] more than four
[988.62 → 989.62] we have the
[989.62 → 990.64] the world record
[990.64 → 991.64] thing for
[991.64 → 992.82] for highlander
[992.82 → 993.70] you don't have
[993.70 → 994.34] it does you only
[994.34 → 995.58] I thought they sent
[995.58 → 996.14] them to all the
[996.14 → 996.64] participants
[996.64 → 998.48] no i I have
[998.48 → 999.18] one oh, oh
[999.18 → 999.98] sorry i completely
[999.98 → 1000.70] misheard you then
[1000.70 → 1002.38] yeah no i I said
[1002.38 → 1003.10] I know we have
[1003.10 → 1004.32] one um but like
[1004.32 → 1005.50] like how many of
[1005.50 → 1006.32] that do you have
[1006.32 → 1008.04] one
[1008.04 → 1009.66] you can get
[1009.66 → 1010.30] as many as you
[1010.30 → 1011.08] want after
[1011.08 → 1012.44] we we we have
[1012.44 → 1013.26] this one probably
[1013.26 → 1013.96] get more than one
[1013.96 → 1014.66] and then I ordered
[1014.66 → 1015.58] like a paper one
[1015.58 → 1016.18] because I wanted
[1016.18 → 1017.36] Linus to have a
[1017.36 → 1018.18] worse one
[1018.18 → 1021.84] what the heck
[1021.84 → 1022.90] you're cheap so
[1022.90 → 1023.70] like you wouldn't
[1023.70 → 1024.52] have wanted to pay
[1024.52 → 1025.64] the 50 dollars for
[1025.64 → 1026.20] the frame
[1026.20 → 1027.14] you know what
[1027.14 → 1027.80] the worst part
[1027.80 → 1028.52] is you know
[1028.52 → 1029.08] what the worst
[1029.08 → 1029.62] part is
[1029.62 → 1031.20] he's laughing
[1031.20 → 1031.62] because it's
[1031.62 → 1031.86] true
[1031.86 → 1032.14] you know what
[1032.14 → 1032.80] the worst part
[1032.80 → 1034.00] is that is a
[1034.00 → 1034.68] hundred percent
[1034.68 → 1035.32] what I did the
[1035.32 → 1035.74] first time
[1035.74 → 1036.30] yeah because
[1036.30 → 1036.80] that's a
[1036.80 → 1039.52] piece of paper
[1039.52 → 1040.30] I was looking at
[1040.30 → 1040.72] that the other
[1040.72 → 1041.16] day I was like
[1041.16 → 1041.74] oh that's the
[1041.74 → 1042.54] highlander one
[1042.54 → 1043.80] yeah it's the
[1043.80 → 1044.62] cheapo one
[1044.62 → 1045.28] bro you can buy
[1045.28 → 1046.08] that frame on
[1046.08 → 1047.32] Amazon I'm not
[1047.32 → 1048.02] that I support
[1048.02 → 1049.62] Mr Bezos aside
[1049.62 → 1050.16] from when he
[1050.16 → 1050.88] trips and falls
[1050.88 → 1052.34] uh oh my god
[1052.34 → 1053.66] okay hold on
[1053.66 → 1054.38] hold on
[1054.38 → 1055.60] okay I want to
[1055.60 → 1056.08] play a game
[1056.08 → 1056.70] I want to play
[1056.70 → 1056.96] a game
[1056.96 → 1057.52] okay Dan
[1057.52 → 1058.66] Dan you're part
[1058.66 → 1059.06] of the game
[1059.06 → 1060.62] I would like
[1060.62 → 1062.56] you to guess
[1062.56 → 1063.88] for each of us
[1063.88 → 1065.42] how many times
[1065.42 → 1066.54] we've watched
[1066.54 → 1067.34] Mr Bezos
[1067.34 → 1067.90] eat shit
[1067.90 → 1069.28] how many times
[1069.28 → 1069.74] we've watched
[1069.74 → 1070.06] the clip
[1070.06 → 1070.64] okay so each
[1070.64 → 1071.26] of us each of
[1071.26 → 1071.82] us has to kind
[1071.82 → 1072.20] of think
[1072.20 → 1073.28] and write down
[1073.28 → 1073.80] what we think
[1073.80 → 1074.70] what we think
[1074.70 → 1075.24] it is how many
[1075.24 → 1075.80] times we think
[1075.80 → 1076.28] we've watched
[1076.28 → 1076.52] it
[1076.52 → 1077.36] and if you
[1077.36 → 1077.84] watch it on
[1077.84 → 1078.58] loop each loop
[1078.58 → 1079.20] counts as one
[1079.20 → 1079.70] each loop
[1079.70 → 1080.52] counts as one
[1080.52 → 1081.34] so hold on
[1081.34 → 1081.92] let me
[1081.92 → 1082.44] think for a
[1082.44 → 1082.68] second
[1082.68 → 1084.64] um okay if
[1084.64 → 1085.22] you show it to
[1085.22 → 1085.84] someone else
[1085.84 → 1086.60] how many views
[1086.60 → 1087.24] does that count
[1087.24 → 1087.88] as is that just
[1087.88 → 1088.86] one or does it
[1088.86 → 1089.72] like count as a
[1089.72 → 1090.30] multiple view
[1090.30 → 1091.16] no I think that's
[1091.16 → 1092.04] your okay that's
[1092.04 → 1092.82] just one okay
[1092.82 → 1098.24] um okay I got my
[1098.24 → 1099.06] number i got my
[1099.06 → 1102.00] number all right i
[1102.00 → 1102.64] think I've got some
[1102.64 → 1104.32] two because did you
[1104.32 → 1105.24] show it on wan show
[1105.24 → 1107.54] uh no like I don't
[1107.54 → 1109.18] did we yes oh we
[1109.18 → 1110.02] did oh I didn't
[1110.02 → 1110.52] count that one
[1110.52 → 1111.32] like hundreds of
[1111.32 → 1112.34] thousands no, no no
[1112.34 → 1113.38] no, no it only counts
[1113.38 → 1114.12] as one it counts as
[1114.12 → 1116.16] one okay I mean does
[1116.16 → 1117.04] it counts as like half
[1117.04 → 1117.66] of one just because
[1117.66 → 1118.58] you're short okay
[1118.58 → 1119.42] let's see how well
[1119.42 → 1120.24] let's see how well
[1120.24 → 1122.42] done I look small
[1122.42 → 1123.46] right now it's oh
[1123.46 → 1124.28] because Luke has a
[1124.28 → 1126.06] big torso right yeah
[1126.06 → 1127.52] my chair is lower
[1127.52 → 1129.02] than Linus's okay
[1129.02 → 1130.22] Dan that's weird
[1130.22 → 1131.66] okay Dan each loop
[1131.66 → 1132.78] counts each loop
[1132.78 → 1133.90] counts all right so
[1133.90 → 1134.82] for Linus I'm gonna
[1134.82 → 1136.46] say uh around 120
[1136.46 → 1138.30] oh come on that's
[1138.30 → 1139.68] not realistic is it
[1139.68 → 1140.54] not who would have
[1140.54 → 1142.10] time for that I mean
[1142.10 → 1143.22] like spread out over
[1143.22 → 1144.08] many weeks like
[1144.08 → 1144.68] we watched it maybe
[1144.68 → 1145.86] four or five times on
[1145.86 → 1146.54] the wan show at
[1146.54 → 1149.30] least did we yeah
[1149.30 → 1151.00] it was funny I don't
[1151.00 → 1151.66] know if we watched
[1151.66 → 1152.68] it that many times
[1152.68 → 1153.56] Jake maybe I'm gonna
[1153.56 → 1154.70] say I don't know
[1154.70 → 1156.22] 20 20 30 something
[1156.22 → 1157.72] like that no not
[1157.72 → 1159.32] that funny and
[1159.32 → 1159.90] what do you want me
[1159.90 → 1160.62] to say or am I
[1160.62 → 1161.56] waiting I guess
[1161.56 → 1162.38] waiting and then
[1162.38 → 1163.52] maybe Luke like
[1163.52 → 1164.56] 10 to 20 times or
[1164.56 → 1165.26] something do you think
[1165.26 → 1167.76] Luke dude what okay
[1167.76 → 1170.10] all right okay so we
[1170.10 → 1170.58] have a bit of a
[1170.58 → 1171.60] problem here because i
[1171.60 → 1172.80] put down seven but i
[1172.80 → 1173.78] forgot that we watched
[1173.78 → 1175.00] it is multiple times when
[1175.00 → 1175.62] we were looking at it
[1175.62 → 1176.28] on wan show so
[1176.28 → 1176.98] realistically I'm
[1176.98 → 1177.68] probably closer to
[1177.68 → 1178.02] 20.
[1178.02 → 1179.70] we also watched it
[1179.70 → 1181.34] like 10 10 times
[1181.34 → 1182.40] during writers meeting
[1182.40 → 1183.84] I don't think I was
[1183.84 → 1184.48] there for that one
[1184.48 → 1185.32] yeah you might have
[1185.32 → 1186.14] been in the car still
[1186.14 → 1186.66] or something did you
[1186.66 → 1187.64] guys really oh yeah
[1187.64 → 1189.70] yeah we were analyzing
[1189.70 → 1192.22] like how did he biff
[1192.22 → 1194.34] this oh he's just bad
[1194.34 → 1196.24] at walking Dan said
[1196.24 → 1198.02] I think 20 for me the
[1198.02 → 1198.96] number that I came up
[1198.96 → 1200.10] for myself was 15
[1200.10 → 1201.64] 15 okay so Dan
[1201.64 → 1202.80] nailed you what i what
[1202.80 → 1203.80] I didn't realize
[1203.80 → 1205.24] originally is that it's
[1205.24 → 1206.86] not like a short loop
[1206.86 → 1210.52] pause oh, oh I missed
[1210.52 → 1212.08] if it's not it's like
[1212.08 → 1213.90] uh it's its not a
[1213.90 → 1214.94] loop it's like a video
[1214.94 → 1215.60] that you have to scroll
[1215.60 → 1217.08] back on yeah so maybe
[1217.08 → 1218.40] you know 120 is probably
[1218.40 → 1219.32] a little bit yeah that's
[1219.32 → 1219.94] probably you don't just
[1219.94 → 1221.18] watch it well no I mean
[1221.18 → 1222.68] people have I mean I did
[1222.68 → 1224.56] rewind like yeah yeah
[1224.56 → 1225.68] but it was manual show
[1225.68 → 1227.22] the people no, no no
[1227.22 → 1228.44] that's I don't want to
[1228.44 → 1229.82] get copyright strike this
[1229.82 → 1231.76] is transformative baby no
[1231.76 → 1232.64] I don't want to get a
[1232.64 → 1233.76] copyright strike over it
[1233.76 → 1235.08] dude from daddy Bezos
[1235.08 → 1235.70] dude we've been
[1235.70 → 1237.04] copyright struck for
[1237.04 → 1238.34] like showing game
[1238.34 → 1239.90] trailers well that is
[1239.90 → 1241.38] like the one thing that
[1241.38 → 1242.64] you get copy strike yeah
[1242.64 → 1243.86] it's ridiculous not even
[1243.86 → 1245.02] just Nintendo ones either
[1245.02 → 1246.32] just being Moody pie dude
[1246.32 → 1248.08] it's literally promotional
[1248.08 → 1250.72] content it's literally ads
[1250.72 → 1252.20] can we copy strike Linus
[1252.20 → 1254.40] tech tips it's an old meme
[1254.40 → 1255.92] but it checks out I like it
[1255.92 → 1257.34] it's good it's pretty good i
[1257.34 → 1258.04] got it
[1258.04 → 1260.16] um chat says yes we can
[1260.16 → 1261.30] what are we supposed to be
[1261.30 → 1262.44] talking about right now
[1262.44 → 1263.94] oh yeah what's your number
[1263.94 → 1265.04] what's your number what's
[1265.04 → 1265.74] your number I'm going to go
[1265.74 → 1266.92] with like probably Dan i
[1266.92 → 1267.62] think Dan was right it's
[1267.62 → 1269.08] probably 20 times probably
[1269.08 → 1270.04] probably and a good like
[1270.04 → 1271.52] 15 of those was just the
[1271.52 → 1272.64] first time I saw it
[1272.64 → 1274.24] it's just on repeat
[1274.24 → 1275.76] dude it's so funny
[1275.76 → 1277.00] it's so funny
[1277.00 → 1279.26] um okay right so did you
[1279.26 → 1280.46] did it did anybody actually
[1280.46 → 1281.82] like put any questions in
[1281.82 → 1282.82] the chat or anything I'm
[1282.82 → 1283.86] going to watch the clip on the
[1283.86 → 1285.96] laptop myself there was a
[1285.96 → 1287.50] there's a there's oh man
[1287.50 → 1288.44] what was one of the things
[1288.44 → 1289.30] that I had wanted to
[1289.30 → 1289.72] address
[1289.72 → 1291.40] if I type Bezos biffing
[1291.40 → 1292.46] it will, it come up
[1292.46 → 1293.36] it does
[1293.36 → 1295.28] what was the most annoying
[1295.28 → 1297.22] thing about working on the
[1297.22 → 1298.18] the pie record Jake
[1298.18 → 1303.02] honestly I think the power
[1303.02 → 1304.82] outages are one thing I would
[1304.82 → 1307.10] go with when we were near the
[1307.10 → 1309.20] end like in February
[1309.20 → 1312.76] march timeline the ac was just
[1312.76 → 1315.44] crapping its pants with no
[1315.44 → 1317.76] suitable explanation, so this is
[1317.76 → 1320.60] an amazing uh amazingly
[1320.60 → 1323.02] engineered system okay so it
[1323.02 → 1324.68] has error codes they're little
[1324.68 → 1326.80] lights not um not stored
[1326.80 → 1327.94] anywhere they're just blinking
[1327.94 → 1329.94] lights yeah nice, and they're
[1329.94 → 1331.56] enterprise they're on both
[1331.56 → 1333.06] sides so if there's an error
[1333.06 → 1334.00] with the outside unit it
[1334.00 → 1334.88] blinks the light on the
[1334.88 → 1335.90] outside unit which means you
[1335.90 → 1336.96] have to go outside get on a
[1336.96 → 1338.34] ladder take the thing off to
[1338.34 → 1340.16] see it the inside unit also has
[1340.16 → 1342.78] error codes if it shuts off like
[1342.78 → 1343.94] you know when you're trying to
[1343.94 → 1345.22] do a world record and you really
[1345.22 → 1347.44] need the bloody ac to turn back
[1347.44 → 1348.62] on so you go flip the breaker
[1348.62 → 1349.76] and like come on turn back on
[1349.76 → 1351.72] the codes go away forever and
[1351.72 → 1354.12] there's no history nothing
[1354.12 → 1357.40] saved so you know what happened
[1357.40 → 1360.16] like the first seven times we
[1360.16 → 1361.60] had no idea what was wrong with
[1361.60 → 1363.48] it is nice literally none and even
[1363.48 → 1365.02] the HVAC guys were like I don't
[1365.02 → 1369.06] know come on you're like 250
[1369.06 → 1370.78] dollars an hour what the heck
[1370.78 → 1373.68] anyway it ended up being that
[1373.68 → 1375.98] the ac system had basically no
[1375.98 → 1377.36] refrigerant left in if it was
[1377.36 → 1378.76] supposed to have like I don't
[1378.76 → 1379.68] know I don't want to say a number
[1379.68 → 1380.56] because I don't know the actual
[1380.56 → 1382.08] number let's say it's 10 pounds of
[1382.08 → 1383.14] refrigerant supposed to be in this
[1383.14 → 1386.46] loop right there was like 0.6 i
[1386.46 → 1388.86] don't know how this keeps
[1388.86 → 1390.40] happening do you know how many
[1390.40 → 1393.50] times they had leaks in that one
[1393.50 → 1395.56] mini split system in the server room
[1395.56 → 1397.54] over here it's probably leaked like a
[1397.54 → 1400.78] dozen times I okay and I'm not
[1400.78 → 1402.14] even I'm not even trying to be a
[1402.14 → 1403.86] jerk about it yeah right because
[1403.86 → 1406.30] it's its easy right it's easy to
[1406.30 → 1407.58] look at someone else's job and be
[1407.58 → 1408.94] like oh it can't be that hard you
[1408.94 → 1410.68] know professional athletes how do you
[1410.68 → 1412.60] miss that no I could my grandma
[1412.60 → 1413.78] could have kicked that in you know
[1413.78 → 1415.46] whatever right like that's easy to
[1415.46 → 1419.38] do but like in this case i actually
[1419.38 → 1421.36] have installed a mini split system
[1421.36 → 1423.16] yeah and yours are mint right
[1423.16 → 1427.08] yeah they work great how fucking hard
[1427.08 → 1428.98] is this Brian the electrician HVAC
[1428.98 → 1434.82] man I mean yes I did get help but
[1434.82 → 1437.24] nothing that we did nothing we did
[1437.24 → 1439.10] was super complicated yeah you get
[1439.10 → 1441.74] some copper tube you raise some
[1441.74 → 1443.70] fittings on it, and you make sure
[1443.70 → 1446.54] they're tight what are they doing i
[1446.54 → 1448.36] mean like no shade the one in creator
[1448.36 → 1450.24] warehouse broke a month ago too okay
[1450.24 → 1452.72] let's give them a little shade um you
[1452.72 → 1456.14] did also approve the cheapest HVAC quote
[1456.14 → 1458.24] we got okay I didn't I had nothing to
[1458.24 → 1460.18] do with it, I told them get something
[1460.18 → 1463.78] good i I can't control I can't control
[1463.78 → 1466.46] what people actually go ahead with yeah
[1466.46 → 1470.94] yeah sure great literally though who did
[1470.94 → 1472.88] it I don't know man it doesn't matter
[1472.88 → 1474.68] we don't yeah I'm going to throw anybody
[1474.68 → 1476.70] under the bus there's no point the
[1476.70 → 1478.26] company that does the maintenance now is
[1478.26 → 1481.60] a lot better but yeah it was rough and
[1481.60 → 1483.22] to be clear I think maybe you're like
[1483.22 → 1486.06] overestimating the like average effort
[1486.06 → 1488.70] and that that your average contractor is
[1488.70 → 1491.24] putting in oh I'm really not did i
[1491.24 → 1492.40] ever show you the pictures of my lawn
[1492.40 → 1492.84] right now
[1492.84 → 1495.90] with the gravel on it did you show them
[1495.90 → 1497.34] the pictures of your lawn with the gravel
[1497.34 → 1497.86] did I
[1497.86 → 1502.42] dude it's so bad wait has it been fixed
[1502.42 → 1505.50] yet they are there today like with what
[1505.50 → 1508.80] to their credit 70 rakes to their credit
[1508.80 → 1512.96] the company that screwed it up big vacuum
[1512.96 → 1515.40] dude we'd already think it is a big vacuum
[1515.40 → 1518.86] we had already paid them we had already
[1518.86 → 1520.88] paid them so like if they were anything
[1520.88 → 1522.44] like some of the contractors that we've
[1522.44 → 1524.22] worked with in the past they would have
[1524.22 → 1527.82] just ghosted us a hundred percent um but
[1527.82 → 1530.10] no they're they're actually good guys
[1530.10 → 1531.72] they actually came back so what they're
[1531.72 → 1534.02] doing is basically they're putting an
[1534.02 → 1537.26] inch of topsoil over our entire lawn oh
[1537.26 → 1538.68] then you're going to have like the minors
[1538.68 → 1539.16] drainage
[1539.16 → 1542.20] yeah to a point to a point yeah and then
[1542.20 → 1543.56] once it's saturated it's game over
[1543.56 → 1547.28] well does your lawn have like uh drainage
[1547.28 → 1550.30] underneath like drainage pipes yeah oh I'm
[1550.30 → 1551.96] surprised that there was just one part
[1551.96 → 1554.00] that like didn't and a couple other
[1554.00 → 1555.48] little spots that were a little bit
[1555.48 → 1557.66] soggy so Yvonne was like hey can you
[1557.66 → 1560.14] guys come and just kind of address that
[1560.14 → 1562.50] and they came and dumped gravel all over
[1562.50 → 1563.60] the whole thing because of a
[1563.60 → 1564.38] miscommunication
[1564.38 → 1567.78] so what happened was the company whose
[1567.78 → 1570.58] job it is to just deliver like
[1570.58 → 1573.86] wheelbarrows of crap to a job site oh i
[1573.86 → 1576.58] see where they got it wrong and then the
[1576.58 → 1578.28] guys that were just like the guys to
[1578.28 → 1580.18] just spread the stuff over they didn't
[1580.18 → 1581.66] question it because they were like why
[1581.66 → 1583.72] would they deliver the wrong thing and
[1583.72 → 1585.56] then when the super shows up on the
[1585.56 → 1588.46] site he goes oh my god what happened
[1588.46 → 1594.06] I'm laughing at both this story and
[1594.06 → 1596.22] Jeff Bezos falling on my laptop on
[1596.22 → 1596.50] repeat
[1596.50 → 1599.28] he's got to get his count up
[1599.28 → 1602.66] well okay, so one thing is line
[1602.66 → 1603.64] said we weren't going to go off the
[1603.64 → 1606.22] rails I'm watching Joe uh oh yeah you
[1606.22 → 1608.04] got my laptop going here oh yeah this is
[1608.04 → 1610.70] great I've got my subway surfers doing
[1610.70 → 1611.26] my job
[1611.26 → 1614.20] he was just too excited
[1614.20 → 1619.10] so what did you promise at the start of
[1619.10 → 1620.68] the show that we were going to stay on
[1620.68 → 1621.14] the rails
[1621.14 → 1623.88] all right we have not stayed on the
[1623.88 → 1625.36] rails today on an airplane like
[1625.36 → 1625.68] tonight
[1625.68 → 1626.64] don't worry about it
[1626.64 → 1629.48] I haven't seen a lot of questions
[1629.48 → 1630.30] with the pie stuff
[1630.30 → 1632.10] oh I got one I saw is why didn't you
[1632.10 → 1633.50] calculate it to pie
[1633.50 → 1635.74] i you know now that everyone has
[1635.74 → 1638.24] said that I'm like wow I'm an idiot
[1638.24 → 1640.12] uh yeah we should have done that
[1640.12 → 1643.30] the thing is to 300 trillion 69 or
[1643.30 → 1645.44] something like there's what was why
[1645.44 → 1646.92] the round number, so there's a few
[1646.92 → 1649.40] factors here it's like the main
[1649.40 → 1650.98] concern is your storage space right
[1650.98 → 1653.36] because you have the memory in the
[1653.36 → 1655.50] computer that's your like active
[1655.50 → 1657.22] working memory and then the storage
[1657.22 → 1659.50] space isn't used to store the output
[1659.50 → 1662.46] I mean it is later on, but it's used
[1662.46 → 1665.04] as swap space which is just like
[1665.04 → 1667.04] memory but slower right you know when
[1667.04 → 1668.92] your computer has a swap it's its
[1668.92 → 1671.52] it's slow but in this case it's swap
[1671.52 → 1673.12] that's 100 gigabytes a second so it's
[1673.12 → 1675.56] fast but not as fast as three terabytes
[1675.56 → 1676.20] of ddr5
[1676.20 → 1678.96] anyway um where was I going with this
[1678.96 → 1681.16] uh uh uh oh yeah right okay so
[1681.16 → 1682.86] originally we were trying to do 200
[1682.86 → 1684.32] trillion digits, and we had the storage
[1684.32 → 1687.00] capacity for that and then when we were
[1687.00 → 1689.06] trying to do 300 trillion digits we
[1689.06 → 1693.00] were like we're going to have 98 percent
[1693.00 → 1695.14] of the like we were going to use 98 percent
[1695.14 → 1697.36] of the capacity right okay but i later
[1697.36 → 1699.56] found out like right before the run you
[1699.56 → 1701.54] don't actually have to output both sets
[1701.54 → 1703.50] of digits, so traditionally people would
[1703.50 → 1705.54] output the hexadecimal version which is
[1705.54 → 1706.76] what is actually calculated by the
[1706.76 → 1708.92] program and the decimal version the
[1708.92 → 1710.98] decimal version is longer takes up more
[1710.98 → 1713.28] space, but that's what you would
[1713.28 → 1715.24] traditionally read 3.1415 blah blah blah
[1715.24 → 1716.98] blah right the hexadecimal format
[1716.98 → 1718.68] wouldn't really like to mean a lot to
[1718.68 → 1721.10] most people until you base convert it
[1721.10 → 1723.12] but you don't have to output it so i
[1723.12 → 1725.76] disabled it which saved us like 120
[1725.76 → 1727.60] terabytes compressed so we could have
[1727.60 → 1730.40] used that extra space to calculate 14
[1730.40 → 1733.64] trillion more digits but I would have
[1733.64 → 1735.80] settled for just like 69 more than that
[1735.80 → 1738.10] you know what here's the PR response i
[1738.10 → 1740.70] do that here's the PR response because
[1740.70 → 1742.02] then we would have a Guinness record
[1742.02 → 1744.92] that was that's iconic what do you mean
[1744.92 → 1747.28] uh yeah um no, no here's the PR response
[1747.28 → 1749.96] you know for us this was you know just
[1749.96 → 1752.54] about the collaboration with Peoria our
[1752.54 → 1754.06] partner on this project well they're
[1754.06 → 1756.06] great, and we wanted to we wanted to leave
[1756.06 → 1758.34] an opportunity for the next person to come
[1758.34 → 1760.50] along and do it to pi digits no that's
[1760.50 → 1763.08] wrong I actually have the real answer um
[1763.08 → 1765.20] in y cruncher when you're setting up the
[1765.20 → 1767.52] run when you type in how many digits
[1767.52 → 1769.38] there's a short form version you can just
[1769.38 → 1772.78] write 300t if I had to write the whole
[1772.78 → 1774.30] thing that would have been like that
[1774.30 → 1775.56] would have been a few more seconds more
[1775.56 → 1777.54] numbers to click and like you might have
[1777.54 → 1780.14] gotten carpal tunnel yeah I wouldn't have
[1780.14 → 1781.78] wanted that i genuinely no I wouldn't have
[1781.78 → 1782.82] wanted to be paying for that
[1782.82 → 1786.22] you don't want to pay for that we already
[1786.22 → 1788.42] established this look at the frame buddy
[1788.42 → 1789.98] that's that's covered that's already
[1789.98 → 1791.62] covered he already pays he pays for that
[1791.62 → 1793.86] anyway yeah no I think our I think our
[1793.86 → 1796.08] premiums go I think our our our like
[1796.08 → 1798.04] deductible and premiums go up if people
[1798.04 → 1799.96] use everything premiums go up otherwise i
[1799.96 → 1801.70] think it'll be fun yeah no i I think i
[1801.70 → 1803.78] think it goes up if everybody only is
[1803.78 → 1804.74] you fill in the form
[1804.74 → 1810.24] okay Dan has never filled the form i
[1810.24 → 1811.54] don't want to cost Linus money no
[1811.54 → 1812.94] everyone has to fill out the form
[1812.94 → 1814.56] properly you can't joke about that
[1814.56 → 1817.56] unless you're Linus no I fill out the
[1817.56 → 1819.18] form it's extremely important you fill
[1819.18 → 1820.46] out the I have somebody fill out the
[1820.46 → 1823.28] form that sounds more correct that
[1823.28 → 1825.46] sounds a lot oh delegation i
[1825.46 → 1827.54] sign management training I sign the form
[1827.54 → 1829.88] I sign the form I have a merch message
[1829.88 → 1832.00] if I get a boo-boo if I get a boo-boo
[1832.00 → 1834.54] on set I sign the form okay yes how
[1834.54 → 1836.52] much is there even to fill out before
[1836.52 → 1838.38] you sign if it's like nothing you don't
[1838.38 → 1840.62] even fill it out like you have Vance fill
[1840.62 → 1842.88] out like no the issue is that no the
[1842.88 → 1845.22] issue is that I have to like to go and find
[1845.22 → 1847.54] someone on the safety committee to like
[1847.54 → 1850.30] see it filled out like it's the whole
[1850.30 → 1852.44] process of it I take great joy in it
[1852.44 → 1853.82] because usually it's Dennis that's been
[1853.82 → 1855.54] filling it out for me and I always enjoy a
[1855.54 → 1858.42] good little conversation with Dennis so
[1858.42 → 1860.00] they just they have it filled out
[1860.00 → 1861.22] and they bring it to me and then I sign
[1861.22 → 1862.42] it and that way the shoot doesn't have
[1862.42 → 1864.08] to be interrupted and I can just keep
[1864.08 → 1865.46] filming that's how it works for
[1865.46 → 1868.06] everybody is it he's not special oh well
[1868.06 → 1869.98] that's good yeah it is the process that
[1869.98 → 1871.30] actually sounds like a way smarter
[1871.30 → 1872.96] process so that's good because the i
[1872.96 → 1874.14] don't know how to fill out this form
[1874.14 → 1876.20] there's like six boxes they could have
[1876.20 → 1877.66] any information what am I supposed to
[1877.66 → 1879.88] put where it says name they fill it up
[1879.88 → 1883.36] for you yeah where did you get your cut
[1883.36 → 1885.20] what were you doing what are you
[1885.20 → 1886.48] filling the parking lot what's my
[1886.48 → 1890.30] address I don't know it hurts here's
[1890.30 → 1892.38] your band-aid that will cost us an
[1892.38 → 1894.22] extra thousand a month in premium my
[1894.22 → 1895.92] favourite field is how are we going to
[1895.92 → 1898.64] prevent this in the future i I have
[1898.64 → 1901.02] literally written I have actually dumb i
[1901.02 → 1902.86] have filled it out for myself a few
[1902.86 → 1904.66] times and I have literally written not
[1904.66 → 1905.36] do that again
[1905.36 → 1910.12] does that qualify is that good I think so
[1910.12 → 1912.18] there's like if the cause is just that i
[1912.18 → 1912.84] was stupid
[1912.84 → 1916.98] just no I think if it's your stupid and
[1916.98 → 1918.50] you've never done this thing before and
[1918.50 → 1920.18] you don't need to do it again then i
[1920.18 → 1921.64] think yeah it's fair to just be like
[1921.64 → 1923.24] well drill through your hand why did you
[1923.24 → 1925.52] do it in the first place Luke gosh i
[1925.52 → 1927.68] think I didn't know yeah it was a
[1927.68 → 1929.12] learning I didn't know it would hurt
[1929.12 → 1932.22] yeah okay sorry Dan you want to just
[1932.22 → 1934.46] yeah how much electricity did it cost
[1934.46 → 1935.28] in the socket
[1935.28 → 1938.28] uh I mean probably more than what was
[1938.28 → 1940.12] shown in the video because that didn't
[1940.12 → 1943.28] well actually no I put a year yeah yeah
[1943.88 → 1945.06] yeah yeah yeah okay so that's probably
[1945.06 → 1945.56] about right
[1945.56 → 1948.30] yeah well I don't even remember I blocked
[1948.30 → 1950.28] if it was like I blocked it from my mind
[1950.28 → 1952.86] just for your reference just so you can
[1952.86 → 1955.34] thanks re-sear this into your brain i
[1955.34 → 1956.86] believe what the calculator said was
[1956.86 → 1958.96] like eighty-six hundred dollars Canadian
[1958.96 → 1963.46] that is wild I mean nobody tell him
[1963.46 → 1965.90] about the brink project going on
[1965.90 → 1968.46] right now we can take some solace in the
[1968.46 → 1970.54] fact that this is more useful than
[1970.54 → 1974.76] mining a lot of cryptocurrencies so at
[1974.76 → 1976.62] least there's that or as useful is it oh
[1976.62 → 1980.02] I see it's as useful there are equally
[1980.02 → 1981.84] pointless things that we could have
[1981.84 → 1983.96] burned fossil fuels for what do people
[1983.96 → 1986.34] use that many just it's nothing you
[1986.34 → 1988.46] don't you don't it's like something i
[1988.46 → 1989.80] think what people have been saying is
[1989.80 → 1991.64] like NASA even in their craziest
[1991.64 → 1993.76] calculations use like 34 digits or
[1993.76 → 1994.72] something like that yeah, and you can
[1994.72 → 1997.08] calculate something the entire
[1997.08 → 1999.38] size of the universe to an atom to the
[1999.38 → 2002.00] site yeah um in like with like a couple
[2002.00 → 2003.90] dozen a few dozen digits of pi or
[2003.90 → 2004.78] something that's what the YouTube
[2004.78 → 2006.34] comments tell me we know how accurate
[2006.34 → 2008.84] those are yeah well engineers use like
[2008.84 → 2010.58] yeah they just round it to four
[2010.58 → 2014.14] yeah they round up it's like good enough
[2014.14 → 2017.92] uh will swami by the way made the point
[2017.92 → 2020.08] better than I possibly could have as to
[2020.08 → 2022.96] why no we are not printing this out at
[2022.96 → 2025.32] Linus tech tips a production printer is
[2025.32 → 2027.28] rated for about 1 million sheets per
[2027.28 → 2029.68] month it would literally take 1,000
[2029.68 → 2032.74] months to print that aka 83 years now
[2032.74 → 2034.18] that sounds like a skill issue you
[2034.18 → 2036.58] clearly just need more printers duh yeah
[2036.58 → 2037.96] what are you talking about yeah like what
[2037.96 → 2039.58] about those big newspaper printer
[2039.58 → 2041.24] machine things have you seen those
[2041.24 → 2043.96] things rip larger paper they did
[2043.96 → 2046.60] network distributed pie calculations they
[2046.60 → 2048.04] could do network distributed printing
[2048.04 → 2050.14] brother some of the comments on this video
[2050.14 → 2052.42] really are amazing as a mechanic watching
[2052.42 → 2054.46] this video and trying to understand it
[2054.46 → 2057.28] made me realize what other people hear when I talk about cars
[2057.28 → 2062.32] literally nothing yeah that's great
[2062.32 → 2066.28] it's exhausting I told the girlfriend yeah i
[2066.28 → 2071.98] I needed a super what no, no i I needed a supercharger it's just an
[2071.98 → 2077.98] alternator if it's for charging its it needed that it makes a noise a
[2077.98 → 2081.24] spinning noise yeah yeah that's good for it yeah you got it cheap because the
[2081.24 → 2083.66] bearings are gone exactly yeah yeah yeah
[2083.66 → 2091.28] father and son episodes are so wholesome I just think we need to get Linus a supercharger
[2091.28 → 2098.74] hey since you're here oh boy uh since you're here um there were some people who had some concerns
[2098.74 → 2104.12] about the battery backup ah she's mint at my place she's mint um for now yeah so
[2104.12 → 2112.52] she's mint so i I scouted the location oh please i was going to ask you about this yeah so we we we
[2112.52 → 2119.24] hear you, and we actually did want to put the battery banks outside that was the original
[2119.24 → 2126.28] plan anyway uh, but it was a lot easier for the proof of concept which yeah he's telling us to move on so
[2126.28 → 2129.80] maybe we'll make this the last thing we chat about, and then we'll actually do that that's clever
[2129.80 → 2136.28] yeah um well he has to deal with a host with ADHD you also don't have to listen or two it's just
[2136.28 → 2142.44] it's just a guide yeah double your pleasure double your fun today hell yeah one for each hand so we
[2142.44 → 2146.92] are aware that it would be better to have the batteries outside um, but we wanted to do this
[2146.92 → 2152.12] proof of concept for a couple of reasons number one is that I didn't want to go all in and spend
[2152.12 → 2156.28] tens of thousands of dollars on something that we would then discover you know what this is actually
[2156.28 → 2161.88] kind of beyond our scope he had no faith is the answer yeah well that we have bitten off more
[2161.88 → 2168.44] than we can chew in the past I'll, I'm just going to say that okay and number two is because Jake needed
[2168.44 → 2173.48] to do a smaller scale project so that he can put in all his tickets at the Christmas party to get the
[2173.48 → 2178.84] cast off one after I stop using the initial deployment I'm just going to borrow it forever what do you mean
[2181.88 → 2187.40] alex wild Alex dick our logistics manager is going to be like to thank you Jake I really appreciate
[2187.40 → 2191.40] you for getting this giant thing out of the warehouse just sign it thanks sign it out to
[2191.40 → 2197.40] Jake that's 100 percent going to be his answer I would like for the record to make it very clear
[2197.40 → 2201.88] that that is not how that works for any other employees who are watching this right 100 only
[2201.88 → 2210.28] for Jake no that's what Linus is saying no, no that is not yeah Luke just steals stuff that is not how it
[2210.28 → 2215.00] works it's not how it works that is not how it works i those are the two reasons for the smaller
[2215.00 → 2221.24] scale deployment because Jake wants one and because I didn't want to go full hog immediately so
[2221.40 → 2226.76] good news and bad news which one do you want first I don't know like I'm not going to listen to your bad
[2226.76 → 2232.68] news anyway so just send it okay whatever yeah, so the good news is the good news is I have full faith
[2232.68 → 2238.44] now because that deployment actually for all the concerns that people raised about it there is a few
[2238.44 → 2242.68] kind of valid like oh we should have connectors on the things like yes I know that and there should
[2242.68 → 2248.68] be covers on some of the know high current that's why there are connectors on some of them and not
[2248.68 → 2253.72] others it's because they gave us the wrong size okay so that's the good news yeah the bad news is
[2253.72 → 2258.44] we don't have a straight run from the mech room to the outside oh wait no I didn't I already tell
[2258.44 → 2266.60] we solved this is ADHD right okay incarnate unfortunately by the panel outside yeah like
[2266.60 → 2273.80] where the power comes into the house there's not a great spot for it yeah, but we don't need a great spot
[2273.80 → 2279.72] we just need a spot oh no you don't go down the side of your house
[2279.72 → 2283.56] PSOH PSOH PSOH
[2283.56 → 2284.76] he doesn't
[2287.56 → 2292.12] am I wrong when was the last time you went down the side of your house before me asking you to go
[2292.12 → 2297.72] there to pick blueberries so it would have been last august what because there's a year okay you can
[2297.72 → 2302.20] you can work around it like in the summer I go there okay so like in the summer I go there we
[2302.20 → 2306.76] need to mount the like inverter thingy so the original plan was to put it in the mech room and
[2306.76 → 2312.04] like make a concrete box or concrete board or something where you know you have an hour of
[2312.04 → 2318.68] it exploded and put some like fire retardant stuff in their like whatever right um, but then we were
[2318.68 → 2323.72] Jesus uh, and then we were like let's just put everything outside because the inverter needs to go
[2323.72 → 2329.16] upstream of the main panel anyway so that we can ac couple the solar to it yeah so why are we putting
[2329.16 → 2333.56] inside let's just put everything outside so if the inverter is on the side of your house yes
[2333.56 → 2340.36] how far are these batteries going to be um like how many iPhones tall is this run going to be
[2340.36 → 2347.16] it's going to be okay to get it kind of like out of the way this better be an iPhone to get it out
[2347.16 → 2353.56] of the way it would probably be about 40 iPhones it's pretty it's pretty far like batteries from
[2353.56 → 2358.76] the inverter um yeah is there like anything we can put it on there or is that that's dirt
[2359.56 → 2364.52] and we're pouring we're pouring a pad it's dirt or we'll ask for a pad, and instead we'll get
[2364.52 → 2372.20] large gravel its strawberry plants that's 19.2 feet wow wait what iPhones are we talking pro maxes
[2372.20 → 2377.16] what do you what are you comparing that's the iPhone 12 14 okay sorry how many iPhone 13 minis let's go
[2377.16 → 2382.36] with that um and this is wait this is in your backyard or is this still on the side of the house on the side
[2382.36 → 2386.76] of the house how do you care about the plants on the side of the house well I mean they're strawberries
[2386.76 → 2393.88] like they know the kids like them, they eat strawberries there you know like kids do this is
[2393.88 → 2399.56] going to be like losing power kids eat strawberries it's going to be a monumentally larger monumentally
[2400.28 → 2407.72] yeah sure larger project yeah and I'm I'm i have to confess hundreds of kilograms of batteries I'm not
[2407.72 → 2413.08] super stoked on like the size of it this is like pallets of batteries yes i know Jake yeah
[2413.08 → 2421.16] yeah like did you tell them not trivial um no I don't think so oh well we what we were talking
[2421.16 → 2428.44] about was like 200 kilowatt-hours yeah so the idea was that we could use a thousand wait I can show
[2428.44 → 2434.52] them I can show them for 200 hours so literally if we were using the house normally we could be down for like
[2434.52 → 2440.28] like three days okay this sounds four days wait hold on hold on your lap is
[2440.28 → 2446.36] totally warranted and this does sound insane but when you do it DIY it's actually less expensive than
[2446.36 → 2450.60] you would think I mean obviously we're talking about tens of thousands of dollars, but we're not actually
[2450.60 → 2456.04] talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars surprisingly sure does that sound like does this
[2456.04 → 2460.36] this sounds like something that would cost like 150 yeah that sounds quite reasonable am I crazy a lot of
[2460.36 → 2465.80] power yeah no it is sounds like the kind of thing that if we went, and we got it you know quoted
[2465.80 → 2471.32] properly that they would want like hundreds of thousands of dollars for, but it's its actually how
[2471.32 → 2476.36] do I do this less than you'd think how do I do uh here I got you why does this say oh Luke lap like
[2476.36 → 2485.16] laptop yeah not like why is there a lap cam that costs extra per month this is way after dark okay so this is
[2485.16 → 2489.88] eve is one of the major Chinese LFP battery manufacturers this is like one of their newer
[2489.88 → 2498.12] models it's 314 amp hours at 3.2 volts it's roughly one kilowatt-hour this cell if you buy between 100 and
[2498.12 → 2504.68] 2 000 of them is 60 us dollars yeah before obviously before shipping obviously before tariffs if you're in
[2504.68 → 2514.60] the US I'm so sorry um get shrieked but what if we buy 50 000 pieces 250 of them times 60 it's 15 grand
[2515.16 → 2521.40] yeah for 250 kilowatt-hours which is a lot of money a lot of money but that's a lot that's like how
[2521.40 → 2526.12] much is a power like a tesla power wall that is a freaking hold on does the bulk discount get
[2526.12 → 2535.40] any better uh no right yeah when you buy 500 000 okay yeah so a power wall is only 13 and a half
[2535.40 → 2541.00] kilowatt-hours and how much does it cost 16 um something like i forget how much they're
[2541.00 → 2545.48] they're freaking expensive because you have to get it but that includes the inverter yeah yeah yeah so it
[2545.48 → 2550.44] it includes more this is just raw power we actually still need to do the installation we still need an
[2550.44 → 2556.52] inverter so something we like inverter wise like this is no BMS are we planning to just like oh hey are we
[2556.52 → 2561.32] planning to just weld these together or like uh no it'll be like a bus bar situation no, no no, no no
[2561.32 → 2565.56] this is actually not getting bad the very BMS that thing's super cool right that was built for
[2565.56 → 2575.40] for car swaps tesla swaps specifically you know say what you will about that guy um but their batteries
[2575.40 → 2579.72] are very useful for EV swapping vehicles all right that's what I'm going with this sure um
[2579.72 → 2589.16] they made a new thing called I think it's called like the very node oh he'll figure it out yeah okay
[2589.16 → 2594.92] it's not out yet, but they made a here's a here's our DIY balance board that hooks up to the main thing
[2595.72 → 2600.36] so you buy these and then I think they support like I don't want to say a number because I don't know but
[2600.36 → 2605.80] like 15 cells or something like that rights and so you're 150 bucks you buy their website is down i
[2605.80 → 2611.48] wonder why that is um way to go Sancho thanks Sancho I hadn't even opened it yet like what the
[2611.48 → 2618.04] they're quick yeah you said it too quick yeah just the last thing you want to do is like talk about a
[2618.04 → 2623.24] funny domain that's available or whatever because they're like they're on it okay so don't do it so
[2623.24 → 2629.88] 16 cells in series which is I remember correctly 16 times 3.2 I think that's the optimal yeah yeah yeah
[2629.88 → 2634.36] so about 48 so 16 is how many usually how you want in series so we would need one of these for each
[2634.36 → 2641.40] series set so you're talking like a few grand in BMS nodes yeah you're talking like the inverters get
[2641.40 → 2648.28] way more expensive the one we used for this project was the eg4 6k XP whatever, but that was sized for
[2648.28 → 2655.40] like the rack six kilowatts and the and some but like not for the house, so this is 18 kilowatts in one box
[2655.40 → 2661.88] and it's seven grand yeah so it's its almost it kind of scales almost linearly to be honest yeah um
[2661.88 → 2668.04] they also have a cool one called like the grid boss I think it's called the grid boss oh flex boss
[2668.04 → 2673.48] the grid box is like the integration thing this is the bigger one and to be clear there are also like
[2673.48 → 2678.44] there are other companies that make these the eg4 one worked pretty good power your neighbourhood dude
[2678.44 → 2684.12] yeah um I don't know that we will for sure use this, but this is something that they said that they had and
[2685.08 → 2690.60] that was cool we might need to use like two or three though it really depends because you were telling me
[2690.60 → 2695.08] you wanted to be able to charge your car off of this like you talking charging your car at full rate
[2696.52 → 2701.96] because that's like that's a few i I don't think I would, I don't think I would expect to actually
[2701.96 → 2707.48] charge my car off it that seems stupid I mean that seems pretty dumb what is it with that said now i
[2707.48 → 2713.40] mean you could charge your car off is it a 30 amp very little uh I think it's a 30 amp yeah so but is
[2713.40 → 2719.48] that actually the charge rate like it's a 40. No it's pretty weak i I like got the wrong ones basically i
[2719.48 → 2724.20] asked for a specific one and then the contractors ordered a different one from the same company
[2724.76 → 2729.64] and I was like yo that's not what I asked for oh I know which one you have it's the dual head one
[2729.64 → 2733.96] yeah it's the dual head one, but there was they have a different one that would do full speed off of
[2733.96 → 2738.92] one head, but this one is the cheaper one that only does half speed off of each one oh it's this one
[2738.92 → 2744.44] it's the sun country one right yeah something like that yeah okay so it's like 40 amps total but when you're
[2744.44 → 2751.16] charging two cars you get 16 amps each, so this is a 7.7 kilowatt yeah this is the yeah it actually
[2751.16 → 2755.16] takes like a minute to charge my car I mean to be fair for your use case it's probably it's totally
[2755.16 → 2760.92] fine, but we could get some we get some ubiquity EV stations yeah I've been I'll, I'll do it eventually
[2761.72 → 2766.12] I don't know if they're CSA approved, yet that could be a thing ah it could be a problem um but
[2766.60 → 2773.40] anyway, so these are hardwired this is not that much though no, no well it's its not that much in terms of
[2773.40 → 2781.00] like the rate of charge yeah but I just having batteries in your yard uh-huh so that you can
[2781.00 → 2788.52] charge the batteries in your car feels a little silly well it is right you are yes, yes uh-huh okay
[2788.52 → 2792.76] I'm glad we got there all right so anyway we're supposed to be talking we're supposed to be doing
[2792.76 → 2797.40] merch messages so wait I want to do one I've never done this before oh my god this guy he's like he
[2797.40 → 2803.48] he doesn't even want to go i have to go on a flight too oh yeah right have you never going to win uh not
[2803.48 → 2810.20] in a long time brother like Christmas years ago yeah nobody does win any more yeah yeah it's we're on

[2846.20 → 2851.72] actively sniffily oh boy it's your fault all right well that's possible uh all right fine I'll
[2851.72 → 2856.44] explain logged into the thing I'll explain merch messages I'll just hack Luke's account here hold on
[2856.44 → 2862.52] merch messages are the way to interact with the show, and we've got some pretty exciting reasons to
[2862.52 → 2871.00] send a merch message it worked we have that's right my friends our biggest t-shirt expansion ever
[2871.00 → 2879.48] we have three fantastic hold on I'm getting to it, we have three fantastic new colours sky forest and

[2931.56 → 2936.68] a no that's a lot is it domains oh yeah that's really expensive I don't know how many domains
[2936.68 → 2942.52] cost I don't know what could it cost like ten dollars yeah, but literally it costs ten dollars
[2943.08 → 2952.20] nobody commented about that um okay we also have to announce we have pre-tariff pricing on MCM at uh

[2989.96 → 2994.60] week for some reason I guess uh for me and Luke, or he will respond to it himself or forward it to
[2994.60 → 3000.52] someone who will address it later so Dan do we have a couple merch messages so you can show the people how
[3000.52 → 3010.92] they work I do I've got one here from um lanky person yeah lots of blank tall sizes why hello LLD
[3010.92 → 3016.20] as a recently diagnosed ADHD person what are some of the pros or cons you all find about both having
[3016.20 → 3021.00] and working with an ADHD person well working with Luke why don't you answer that one what's
[3021.00 → 3026.92] it is like working with an ADHD person all three of us you guys saw it earlier where he was like
[3026.92 → 3032.60] oh we're not going to be able to let's get too far from a run oh, and then it's like no we're putting
[3032.60 → 3040.20] it outside Luke do you have an answer he disconnected for a second oh he might just be ignoring maybe he
[3040.20 → 3046.44] doesn't want to any more frankly I couldn't blame him it's its cool because you can his mic's not
[3046.44 → 3052.28] working oh bummer like you, you can, it's a superpower, and it is also your worst nightmare at the same time
[3052.28 → 3057.80] I mean if you being the person that's asking I'm sure you're aware of this uh you can focus
[3057.80 → 3064.36] so hard when you're in the zone but when you're not in the zone you cannot focus on does that button
[3064.36 → 3070.44] work how do I do it maybe is it going to be a problem if it doesn't work I don't know try it I don't do it
[3070.44 → 3077.16] do it what was I even going to say see that that is what it is what, and you don't get to pick when you
[3077.16 → 3084.84] focus exactly, and you also don't get to pick when you stop focusing that which is also bad that would
[3084.84 → 3091.48] be a great superhero like has anyone ever done that as a superhero gimmick where they like focus man like
[3091.48 → 3095.88] they can't pick when their powers are active and not well you kind of seen that when like spider
[3095.88 → 3101.32] man's learning it's like spider-man or whatever you play balder's gate with wild magic on and his hands
[3101.32 → 3106.28] just like stick to things, and he's like ah I can't remove my hand from stuff is Luke doing that thing
[3106.28 → 3111.00] when you're working from home, and you're like on a meeting it's like it just the is he just looping
[3111.00 → 3117.24] yeah like is he not even there it's like AI Luke can he hear us I don't think he knows that I don't
[3117.24 → 3123.80] know what's going on we can here let's indicate that we're talking to him hi Luke hello Luke can you see us
[3125.64 → 3131.16] is he frozen no he's not he's you sure yeah are we getting I think he's frozen oh no
[3131.16 → 3141.96] Luke okay are you there oh yeah I think he's okay I think he's going to be okay um what I would say
[3141.96 → 3149.16] the biggest challenge is managing the burst productivity yeah and I mean that both for myself
[3149.16 → 3157.16] and for unnamed people on our team who also are somewhat neurodivergent um because you'll run into a
[3157.16 → 3165.00] situation where um and like back when I was a much more integral part of the video pre-production
[3165.00 → 3171.72] timeline or pipeline um I would have I would have this issue right where two out of the five days of
[3171.72 → 3178.60] the work week I would get like realistically everything done and then the other three I'd be
[3178.60 → 3184.84] all over the place right um but what's really ah but on the other hand it can also be like kind of
[3184.84 → 3189.80] a superpower during those times because it's like this endless fountain of creativity, and you can
[3189.80 → 3194.60] kind of push a bunch of little projects going and kind of start a bunch of little fires and see what
[3194.60 → 3199.88] burns and then and then you can like hyper focus and finish the other ones but then also getting
[3199.88 → 3206.52] something finished is really hard oh man I see I have so many things like I feel like I want to
[3206.52 → 3213.56] say because like in my world i I've noticed since becoming starting medication for this condition
[3213.56 → 3217.96] has been an interesting experience because like I feel like I start way more things than I used to
[3217.96 → 3224.28] before I would get the like procrastination of I don't know if I can do this so I'm just not even
[3224.28 → 3230.84] going to start i I fail before I even get there that way I can't fail because i just never tried right so now
[3230.84 → 3235.72] I try and I start doing something and then oh man I feel like I probably have can just show a photo of
[3235.72 → 3242.52] this desk I'll just maybe I'll just show you um yeah I can probably just show that on the show right
[3242.52 → 3246.44] yeah you can just send it to Dan see that can I just like hold it in front of the camera no you
[3246.44 → 3251.88] got to send it to Dan how do I send it to you Dan teams oh gross okay luke should be back
[3251.88 → 3257.80] now see if you can are you back yes nice hey welcome back send it this is going to happen again
[3257.80 → 3263.64] just as a warning it's not my fault hopefully we can recover faster next time yeah now we know okay i
[3263.64 → 3269.24] sent you a photo Dan hopefully there's nothing incriminating in there I will oh Lord it's fun it's like my
[3269.24 → 3274.12] desk there's yeah that's okay nothing important's ever leaked on when before um wait is there anything
[3274.12 → 3280.28] NDA on here no I think it's probably fine I think it's fine there are a couple 3d printers it's a vibe
[3280.28 → 3287.96] you'll get the vibe immediately though whoop there you go okay, so this was my office yesterday nice
[3288.52 → 3293.48] you can see oh no you didn't get into like a cleaning frenzy zone did you oh yeah i did I
[3293.48 → 3297.96] cleaned my I'll show you the after photo yeah no I see I knew the second I saw that you put it away
[3297.96 → 3303.40] I was going to describe things okay the second I saw that I was like you did the thing you were up
[3303.40 → 3308.44] late tidying weren't you no, no actually it was during Jake tidy it was the lights were still on as you can
[3308.44 → 3312.92] see you see this thing right here is that like a dad joke bell yeah is it a real bell yeah yeah that's
[3312.92 → 3318.12] impressive it gives him dopamine how did you like ADHD oh because you like Amazon ordered it while we're on
[3318.12 → 3324.20] the show uh that right there that black thing is like a dry box for the 3d printer that's down here
[3324.20 → 3330.44] nice I printed it before that I had the 3d printer it is still sitting in parts on my desk now it is
[3330.44 → 3334.84] sitting in parts beside the 3d printer ready to go for something I will never put together nice the
[3334.84 → 3341.32] Brusa XL on the other side i 3d printed an enclosure for it uh nice the plexiglass I ordered from China is
[3341.32 → 3345.88] sitting uh in my closet and so are the rest of the parts for the enclosure that I will definitely put
[3345.88 → 3350.84] together at some point those bins they're all supposed to like on the bottom the filament
[3350.84 → 3354.12] stores they're all supposed to have like little things in it to like to pass the filament through
[3354.12 → 3358.92] they don't I've had them for like two years, so these are all things I've started if you could see
[3358.92 → 3364.76] under the pile there's like a BMW manual clutch pedal I was going to make a short throw one I feel like
[3364.76 → 3371.24] this was legit i 3d scanned it this is ADHD though this could very well be my workspace I love that you
[3371.24 → 3376.20] had the intent of having a pegboard wall oh yeah, and you have one tool on it yeah yeah yeah it's like
[3376.20 → 3382.44] that that is classic yeah that's lower accurate yeah yeah that is classic by the way I think you're
[3382.44 → 3389.24] I think your carpool mate is uh waiting for you do you want me to leave right now you're vibing okay cool
[3391.08 → 3398.12] speaking of carpool you see the cars up there yeah um all right oh those are tough but anyway it's like
[3398.12 → 3404.52] I start more things so that's cool but also I don't finish as many that actually um transitions
[3404.52 → 3411.00] us pretty well into something that Luke and I need to talk about because what will happen first will
[3411.00 → 3418.60] Luke complete Final Fantasy 6 or will I finish painting my bike race has been heating up hard dude
[3418.60 → 3425.08] you've been it was a Cold War for a long time yeah and now its guns are blazing dude you
[3425.08 → 3432.12] started that before the pie project I'm pretty sure and that took ages did that work
[3432.12 → 3437.64] I really hope that worked yeah I get to hear it because I'm monitoring differently so I will say this
[3437.64 → 3442.44] um our oh do we want to talk about that later why don't we get through merch messages didn't you tell
[3442.44 → 3448.20] me it looks it you told me it looks uh well it's complicated okay you know what let's talk about
[3448.20 → 3453.32] it now let's talk about it now here we go yes I did I'm sending you a little video sending you a
[3453.32 → 3457.96] little video what even is this show anymore is there supposed to be topics I there are topics
[3457.96 → 3463.64] there's more than one I'll tell you that have we done topics, yet you've done one I think we did one
[3463.64 → 3468.36] well you've been talking about power wall and garbage for an hour that's pretty it's not garbage
[3468.36 → 3472.44] it's going to be quality I hope it's going to be quality what's the worst that could happen okay
[3472.44 → 3476.44] burns down we'll just build another one yeah that's what I was going to say we'll build new children
[3476.44 → 3484.20] that's content um yeah it's fun the cats is what I was concerned about okay so seven of them I got to
[3484.20 → 3492.28] the point where all the parts that needed to be pink were pink I had two little drips two little
[3492.28 → 3497.24] drips you can show the second one first Dan, but you know how to fix the drips right well here's the
[3497.24 → 3505.88] problem because it's a combination of things because I'm ambitious slash foolhardy sometimes see I don't
[3505.88 → 3510.92] have the same issue with not starting things I start things that's yeah yeah not a problem yeah
[3510.92 → 3516.12] um but sometimes I start things that are too big can I just say before you continue I know exactly
[3516.12 → 3519.88] where you're going to go with this and I'm just i I want to write it down, but it's in my brain i just
[3519.88 → 3523.24] want you to know that I've acknowledged this I know where this is about to go and I really hope that
[3523.24 → 3527.16] it's the same place that okay that was a little early Dan go ahead oh you're doing great though
[3527.16 → 3531.40] uh okay, okay now I really know where this is going so I have no problem starting things
[3531.40 → 3538.52] but sometimes i I am a little too ambitious so it's a combination of that and I think i realistically
[3538.52 → 3545.40] probably got some bad advice at some stage in the paint selection process because I ended up with a
[3545.96 → 3556.92] let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven anywhere from about an 11 to a 12
[3556.92 → 3565.96] layer paint that is a lot of layers yeahs so we got two primer one different kinds of primer or the
[3565.96 → 3573.00] same primer the same primer yeah okay two of a solid base a white and that is all easy dude getting it
[3573.00 → 3584.52] primed and white no problem but I have then after that a candy and candy is tough can you clarify how
[3584.52 → 3589.64] many coats are supposed to be on this because about 11 to 12 for the end okay, so this is right
[3589.64 → 3594.60] so for the uninitiated some of the complicated paint coats can be like here you throw down a base coat
[3594.60 → 3599.16] of a certain colour and then a colour coat, and then you have like a pearl coat, and then you have clear
[3599.16 → 3604.84] coat, or maybe you have tinted clear coat wow there's a lot of stages yeahs so I have this is one of
[3604.84 → 3610.04] those so the four of the like the primer and then the base colour four to five realistically to get
[3610.04 → 3614.60] perfect coverage with the white because it doesn't cover very well once you get it um reduced
[3614.60 → 3621.48] for the gun um so that's easy you get a nice even colour if I were to just paint my bike white okay and
[3621.48 → 3631.32] just clear coat that I would have been done ages ago but the pink candy is a nightmare to get
[3631.32 → 3637.80] even and I picked the hardest possible thing to paint with it because if I was doing a hood of a car
[3637.80 → 3645.24] that's easy relatively speaking I think you would have a lot of paint people that would also say
[3645.24 → 3651.32] a flat surface is easy but also hard sure it's easier to fix the screw-ups that you will inevitably
[3651.32 → 3658.12] have a multi-faceted yeah three-dimensional piece with nowhere to freaking hold it and all these
[3658.12 → 3665.80] different tiny little surfaces is really hard to get even and uh i finally and wheels yeah I was just
[3665.80 → 3670.68] going to say wait till you try wheels okay I have progress though I have progress on the wheels but
[3670.68 → 3677.00] anyway hold on first Dan bring up the picture I had two little drips two little drips in the pink
[3677.00 → 3681.88] and I actually found a technique to fix them fixing candy you read online, and they say it's impossible
[3681.88 → 3685.80] and it's basically impossible but I found a technique that actually worked you can kind of see it
[3685.80 → 3691.00] in the very bottom right where it was a little bit too big to work on this one but I almost fixed that
[3691.00 → 3695.32] spot are you talking about the part where all the paint is missing no, no no I'm the very in the very
[3695.32 → 3700.12] very bottom right of the gray part which part the I don't know Dan could you have a mouse cursor can
[3700.12 → 3703.88] you even I'm trying whatever there's a little spot that almost has like kind of a little white
[3703.88 → 3709.80] out I think I see it so basically what happened there was we kind of peeled it back and then masked
[3709.80 → 3714.52] around and then used like a little airbrush like for doing those like temp tattoos little airbrush
[3714.52 → 3719.64] got it on there what was the defect was this like a dust nib oh it was an awful drip I don't
[3719.64 → 3725.16] even know where it came from okay yeah so it was like purple like it went on so heavy it was like
[3725.16 → 3729.64] purple in that spot so we see so we got it off managed to put that on it wouldn't have looked great
[3730.20 → 3733.96] but it would have been passable for the level of quality that I've resigned to at this point and
[3733.96 → 3740.44] this is pre clear coat but yeah but when I went to pull the masking tape off it ripped that whole strip
[3740.44 → 3746.68] off so um Dan do you want to bring up the video that should yeah sure I don't think that was
[3746.68 → 3752.20] supposed to happen not even I don't think your paint is bonded very well, well I can tell you that
[3752.20 → 3758.92] the white is bonded real good to the primer because this is how long it took to get the white off the
[3758.92 → 3764.52] primer it doesn't look like anything's coming out oh it's coming out oh yeah you can see it wow it's
[3764.52 → 3770.92] really on there on the entire front fairing piece of my bike it took like four and a half hours
[3773.64 → 3779.08] so I was at the point where everything was pink coated and then this happened
[3780.52 → 3787.48] the good news is this piece is now white needs to be sanded white one more time and then I'm ready
[3787.48 → 3791.96] to paint it pink again and I'm not going to get a drip on it this time and Jake I figured out wheels
[3791.96 → 3799.24] what do you mean my wheels look like butt right now yeah so I'm re-white coating them but we finally
[3799.24 → 3805.16] found a technique so in order to get the candy on their even we made this Dan you can move that who
[3805.16 → 3810.92] is we uh Yvonne's been helping me a little bit oh so we roped her into this yeah we took my drill
[3810.92 → 3815.56] and then we took a bunch of rolls of tape like small ones that fit in the big ones yeah and basically
[3815.56 → 3823.24] made like a spiny wheel on it, and so she basically watches for a landmark as it turns around
[3823.24 → 3828.52] and is like okay three two one go and I start spraying, and then she's like okay three two one go
[3829.16 → 3834.44] and I move it off, and it's like this is spinning the wheel yeah while she's while she's spinning it
[3834.44 → 3838.84] with the drill with like a big like tape roll thing on it so i actually 3d printed a thing recently
[3838.84 → 3844.04] because I bought new wheels of course yeah um to because I wanted to ceramic course to both of
[3844.04 → 3848.60] those yeah yeah yeah so i 3d printed a thing so I could spin the wheel while I was ceramic coating it
[3848.60 → 3855.24] and then proceeded to not use it i just I have it if you're only doing a solid colour it doesn't
[3855.24 → 3862.04] matter it's not that hard but if you are is you're doing a candy and I'm not even going for the whole
[3862.04 → 3867.32] thing one solid candy so I'm doing a pink stripe you know they make like candy powder coating too
[3867.32 → 3872.76] right yeah well I didn't do that, and it would have been stronger and cheaper, and they wouldn't have
[3872.76 → 3878.20] matched though what all if you did all of them yeah, but it's not just the candy there's the two
[3878.20 → 3882.44] layers of candy and then there's the two layers of pearl yeah well it wouldn't have been the exact
[3882.44 → 3887.40] same thing, but it would have been pretty nice it probably would have been better overall to be honest
[3887.40 → 3892.68] this is great also belt rick says just pay a professional Mr millionaire that is not the
[3892.68 → 3899.24] point what would I even do if I just paid people to do things what would I do what would I comment
[3899.24 → 3906.12] bothered so many people I responded to it somebody else in chat responded to it, you responded to it
[3906.12 → 3911.64] we're all just like what no that is not the point so is the point that you should have just left it
[3911.64 → 3919.64] uh oh just like left it silver no well left oh i 100 should have done that the drip um could you not
[3919.64 → 3925.56] because like I've I've seen people do drip repairs before I've seen techniques where they like to fill the
[3925.56 → 3930.44] surround with bond and then sand it down so that you're sanding down the bond on the outside and not
[3930.44 → 3934.92] ruining the rest of it I've seen techniques where they like just strip everything down and do it again
[3934.92 → 3940.12] I've seen it where they cut it with a knife right so I basically did the knife thing um but the only issue
[3940.12 → 3945.64] is that when I peeled it up it is hadn't cured enough yet yeah it was too fresh that was
[3945.64 → 3952.52] bare metal was it because i no, no that was primer oh so i I did the same thing on my tank and the tank
[3952.52 → 3958.52] worked did you actually can't find the spot on the tank did you not like sand enough between the primer
[3958.52 → 3966.92] and the top coat so uh let's see that was on the um was it too long between too little between I think
[3966.92 → 3972.60] it could have been too long between the primer coat but I think it was just mostly that it hadn't
[3972.60 → 3980.60] been long enough since I did the um since I did the pink on the white well when this is done I think
[3980.60 → 3985.80] it would be really fun for us to polish it oh god I want to I want like I want you and me we should
[3985.80 → 3990.76] polish it no we should, it'll be fun it'll make it look so much better dude you have to polish it
[3990.76 → 3995.32] after otherwise just not going to look good you're going to get rid of all the dust nibs and stuff yeah yeah I like i
[3995.32 → 3998.76] actually do you actually need to yeah that's gonna look like crap that's like requirement even
[3998.76 → 4004.28] if you clear coat it yeah I mean usually when a body shop polishes stuff after they paint it, it looks
[4004.28 → 4013.32] like crap like we fix so many like body shop tried to polish a car oh yeah I have enough so many I have
[4013.32 → 4019.88] enough hours in this project that for you to say anything that sounds anything like more hours is just
[4019.88 → 4024.92] going to make me instantly recoil it'll only take a couple of days you should right now just put everything
[4024.92 → 4030.44] in a bin and go to a powder coating shop that'll solve your problems that's what I'm going to do with
[4030.44 → 4035.40] my wheels I'm not going to bother can you powder coat plastic uh I don't know I'm not aware of that I mean
[4035.40 → 4040.04] that piece you were looking at was plastic so yeah you have to have you tried candy I should probably
[4040.04 → 4044.84] that's that's oh okay that's that's part of the nightmare of painting a bike is that I have steel
[4044.84 → 4049.48] pieces aluminum pieces and plastic pieces, and they're going to be seven different colours
[4050.68 → 4054.60] even though he painted apparently traditional powder coating does not work on plastic I think
[4054.60 → 4060.12] yeah it would melt you have to bake it I think I've seen yeah plastic fancy plastic powder coat stuff
[4060.12 → 4064.60] yeah I'm sure I do there's enough material science these days I'm sure somebody figured something out
[4064.60 → 4070.60] anyway specialized industrial methods seem to something whatever yeah powder coating is cool
[4070.60 → 4077.96] though anyway goodbye okay drive safe see you later Luke bye see you Linus I guess yeah he never
[4077.96 → 4084.04] acknowledges me when I tell him to drive safe oh no I usually say I won't, I also say the same thing to
[4084.04 → 4093.08] my mom, and she doesn't like it no she wouldn't either do i yeah yeah see you later so this time
[4093.08 → 4098.52] he crosses the camera just on the end you know he figured it out that it's better to just quickly go that
[4098.52 → 4105.64] way than to painstakingly make his way across over here uh so i I have updates as well no he's back
[4107.24 → 4117.56] oh oh oh Geez okay um okay so how's your okay so hold on I should probably give the update so all but that
[4117.56 → 4126.12] piece that need to be pink are pink, but they still need two more pearl coats and then two to three clear
[4126.12 → 4132.84] coats before I can actually like to drop anything off for reassembly with the shop so you definitely can't
[4132.84 → 4140.92] finish before 2 a.m are you going to be done today no, but you're going to be leaving the country oh and
[4140.92 → 4150.04] thus away from your bike uh yes and luckily my project is portable yeah okay all right how many how
[4150.04 → 4157.40] many of the party have you reassembled in the world of ruin I'm in the world of ruin okay but just
[4157.40 → 4163.80] barely oh um but I still think I still think I'm going to beat you I still think I'm going to beat you
[4163.80 → 4169.88] okay I still think I'm going to beat you yeah i the reason why it's not that good is because I also had a
[4169.88 → 4179.88] progress issue oh no I lost a save oh what how did you lose a save you're playing on steam i genuinely
[4181.88 → 4188.28] I have no idea what how much something happened with quite a bit of something happened with
[4188.28 → 4196.28] cloud sync um i I like i you know I pre-installed it on my laptop I don't know maybe I don't know i
[4196.28 → 4201.96] pre-installed it on my laptop um because I knew a fair amount of play time while I was on this trip
[4201.96 → 4209.48] was going to be offline this is Final Fantasy 6 uh because as little inflate plane chat so i yeah i
[4209.48 → 4216.12] installed it like at my house ahead of time cloud synced everything before I left and then on the plane
[4216.12 → 4217.72] I loaded it up, and it was like
[4220.28 → 4225.00] way earlier than where I was like many hours lost oh no
[4225.00 → 4233.24] um which usually like I have quit games over that before like just fully just whatever I'm
[4233.24 → 4239.08] done it's like no forget it I'm out yeah that's it, but this is a challenge a competition of sorts
[4239.08 → 4246.28] I almost quit Final Fantasy tactics over an issue like that um yeah I've done this many times yeah I got
[4246.28 → 4254.92] to the I got to the notorious fight where um if you don't happen to build Rama correctly you literally
[4254.92 → 4262.12] can't win it and i I ended up I thought I had lost like 10 hours but I had only lost like
[4262.12 → 4269.32] three or four so i so I stuck it out but I was so mad I was so mad I think we've every gamer has
[4269.32 → 4277.00] probably felt that, and it's just like the rage to how much this matters ratio is probably the highest
[4277.00 → 4280.36] out of anything that I've ever experienced because at the end of the day it's a video game oh
[4280.36 → 4289.08] it's so it doesn't matter at all but the rage is so high so that was me like
[4290.20 → 4295.48] probably an hour into my flight because I didn't pull out the laptop immediately you know i kind of
[4295.48 → 4302.12] got settled you have to wait for the belt thingy to the buckle thingy to the light to
[4302.12 → 4306.44] go off all that kind of stuff I finally get the laptop I load it up and I just stare at it for a while
[4307.08 → 4312.84] thinking like there's got to be some way to fix this right and like obviously no um living says just
[4312.84 → 4328.44] grind to level Edith she'll be great later in the game um yeah so i i I pushed really hard I was
[4328.44 → 4332.20] for for for some context it went so far back I had no esters
[4336.04 → 4341.88] like I lost multiple saves worth and I don't understand what at all what happened oh that's
[4341.88 → 4349.80] wild like i i I don't know, but that's on that one flight ago on the one flight because I've now
[4349.80 → 4357.00] I've done this so now I know what I'm doing I know where I'm going those types of things I realized
[4357.00 → 4366.12] that uh some of the things in the game are very weird um like some of cabin's stuff scale off of
[4366.12 → 4371.64] magic even though he's like a martial arts guy and stuff like that oh yeah things are just kind
[4371.64 → 4379.08] of odd but now I know those things so I just got into like a way more experienced run then go mode
[4379.08 → 4386.20] and i I got to past where I was before on the one flight which is like wildly compressed before uh
[4386.20 → 4395.88] compared to before um and I'm I'm kind of flying I'm much more knowledgeable now on like you know
[4395.88 → 4400.20] checking for weaknesses and hitting things with the right magic and stuff like that so like the
[4400.84 → 4409.48] the fight to get to the floating continent um just blitzed through it oh it was ridiculous yeah
[4410.20 → 4414.28] it ended up being so easy like i I think you commented last time we talked about this you
[4414.28 → 4419.64] commented about how the pixel remaster is too easy I think you said yeah um I get to that fight with
[4419.64 → 4427.80] ultras and whatever his big buddy is whatever yeah something yeah or something um i I think I like
[4427.80 → 4435.72] two shot ultras like just okay so you're like you're like super overpowered now then I'm jacked
[4438.20 → 4443.24] and like I'm doing better about like making sure that I'm min-maxing okay having the right Esper on the
[4443.24 → 4447.72] right person when they level up to gain the bonus how many characters do you have in the world of ruin
[4447.72 → 4456.84] oh no key suggested a poll Dan do it uh whether Luke will finish Final Fantasy 6 or I will
[4456.84 → 4461.56] finish painting the sv650 sure give me one second now hold on a second hold on we got to define
[4461.56 → 4468.04] completion here is Luke allowed to like to look up guides when he gets to the world of ruin or does he
[4468.04 → 4477.32] use the paper manual I think paper manual is all I had when I was a kid
[4478.12 → 4483.40] I feel like it's got to be paper, but you're getting help from Avon not much for what it's worth
[4485.64 → 4491.96] and I'm there working on it every time I will say I am completely down with whatever judgment comes
[4491.96 → 4497.08] here okay and I am totally fine with paper man honestly no lets do paper manual is my completion
[4497.08 → 4500.84] complete when I finish painting it or when the shop assembles the bike
[4500.84 → 4508.52] I feel like when are you going to let your beard grow out when I'm done painting
[4508.52 → 4513.72] when the not when the shop finishes assembly no, no no I'll do when I'm done when I'm done painting
[4513.72 → 4521.56] I'm done like I don't need the mask any more than personally I think it's paint okay I'm making this
[4521.56 → 4525.16] harder for myself I'm saying paper manual, and you can just finish when you're painting but I think
[4525.16 → 4530.36] both of those things make sense as much as I'm some people are saying they think I should be okay just
[4530.36 → 4537.08] for to catch you guys up the the the bet is whether Luke will finish Final Fantasy 6 a game that I've
[4537.08 → 4541.56] been bugging him to play basically since we met because it was like my favourite childhood game even
[4541.56 → 4547.48] though I have realized in also playing through the pixel remaster at the same time as him because I got
[4547.48 → 4551.56] it in my head at some point that I was going to be super ambitious and both finish Final Fantasy 6
[4551.56 → 4556.76] and paint my bike in the time it took him to finish it anyway that's not happening um or if I will
[4556.76 → 4561.40] I will finish painting my motorcycle which has been an ongoing project for I think about two years now
[4565.32 → 4571.00] okay I'm gonna look at the results I'm ready to see the results I'm kind of afraid to look at the
[4571.00 → 4582.20] results uh okay I'm looking at the results who will finish first come on move it over sorry, sorry I'll
[4582.20 → 4586.68] move it I'll move it normally with this question you think it'd be the other way around but 80
[4586.68 → 4596.68] wow three kids buddy three kids yeah exactly
[4600.28 → 4603.80] uh get that other pull out of there we all know they all use Firefox
[4603.80 → 4612.12] well you know what you know what haters I'm going to go home tonight and I'm going to pack and
[4612.12 → 4618.84] I'm going to do some sanding yeah sure you are how much because I know I have time to do
[4620.84 → 4628.28] no way when honestly when the ship flying thing was happening when I was getting to the floating
[4628.28 → 4630.68] continent yeah I thought the game was ending
[4633.56 → 4635.00] is this your first Final Fantasy
[4637.40 → 4645.16] uh I mean I suppose you imagine that the final boss only has two phases right yeah I have no idea
[4645.80 → 4651.96] the only other Final Fantasy I've played through is eight and with eight I played it through on pc so
[4651.96 → 4657.88] you had all the discs so you kind of knew right like there's more content coming right um
[4658.84 → 4669.40] when when when i hit floating continent I was like oh okay um I guess there's more to this
[4670.28 → 4680.52] there's a lot more to it yeah i kind of got that vibe um I also started kind of mulling over like
[4680.52 → 4686.36] all right well there's like a level cap and stuff that my level is not very high um I don't know if you're
[4686.36 → 4690.60] expected to hit the level cap because I'm like I don't know like Pokémon you're not at all okay
[4690.60 → 4697.48] cool yeah no not even a little um, um do you remember what the stakes are of this bet no keys asking
[4698.52 → 4704.36] are there stakes I don't even remember so it was so long ago that I literally cannot remember the
[4704.36 → 4709.64] circumstances of us making this bet I don't think there was it was just sort of like honour
[4709.64 → 4715.56] don't underestimate how hard we will try it was a friendly handshake yeah kind of bragging rights
[4715.56 → 4722.04] type of thing yeah yeah I don't honestly I got so focused on Zeus says maybe we should vote again
[4722.04 → 4726.44] after hearing you talk about how you thought the game was over, and you're at the halfway mark
[4726.44 → 4732.52] well I'm not looking stuff up I'm trying to like and honestly uh it is hit a lull there
[4733.16 → 4738.84] the last time I was playing yeah um it's cooking again the game's fun again right now uh how many
[4738.84 → 4746.44] characters do you have in the world of ruin I'd have to load it up okay you have more than one though
[4747.08 → 4753.08] do you have yeah done you have Tara yeah yeah oh okay you're okay you're moving pretty good then he's
[4753.08 → 4760.68] he's moving pretty good boys I will say that I definitely hit a lull again to the point where i
[4760.68 → 4768.84] just like haven't played it again after where you are oh yeah okay with most of the game this long
[4769.48 → 4774.60] it's such a game this long it is makes sense that there'd be multiple lull points the only thing
[4774.60 → 4781.56] I'm not really enjoying right now is that it is feels like it has a man it's a great game I need to be
[4781.56 → 4786.04] very clear about that before I complain about anything it's fantastic but if if I played
[4786.04 → 4791.00] this game at like the same time that you did this would probably be in my like top three all time I'm
[4791.00 → 4797.32] not even I'm not surprised it is good um it hasn't aged perfectly yeah and I think one of the things
[4797.32 → 4803.24] that has made it not aged perfectly is it came from an era where people would like in a review of a
[4803.24 → 4809.24] game people would include the estimated completion time and if it was too short they'd complain people
[4809.24 → 4815.72] would rate it lowly, and you know what which was dumb dude that is something we never touch on
[4815.72 → 4824.28] when we discuss the cost of games over time because back when we were buying games for 60 70 us dollars
[4824.84 → 4833.00] but it was the mid 90s games were expensive like I don't think I knew anyone as a kid who had more
[4833.00 → 4837.48] than like half a dozen games in their library for a given console, so your game needed to be long so
[4837.48 → 4843.16] you could get a lot of value by the time you had five games you had literally spent more than you
[4843.16 → 4850.28] spent on the console and controllers on the game titles right like that was the dynamic whereas now
[4850.28 → 4855.32] we treat games like they're just disposable you know like oh yeah I tried that game I didn't really
[4855.32 → 4861.56] like it, I like I played it for too long to get a steam refund so like whatever, but it was eight
[4861.56 → 4866.44] dollars in the steam summer sale so who cares you know yeah it's a totally different mentality
[4867.00 → 4871.00] yeah like having more than four or five games was pretty surprising because remember people would do a
[4871.00 → 4875.80] lot of trade-ins and stuff back then too because things are so expensive oh no or you trade with
[4875.80 → 4883.56] your buddies or whatever people say you'll love expedition 33 yeah i i I'm not going to play it right now
[4883.56 → 4889.08] because I need to finish fantasy six but i I wish listed it because it looks really cool yeah I think
[4889.08 → 4897.88] you got time Luke i um I haven't I haven't finished rewriting the wheels yet after I do that I have to
[4897.88 → 4904.76] pink the wheels after I do that I have to mask the wheels then I have to black them then I have to clear
[4904.76 → 4911.80] coat them and i was legitimately worried you're going to be done on this show dude he has to start
[4911.80 → 4919.08] again dude no and the scariest part of the whole thing is still coming because the frame which
[4919.08 → 4925.56] I did pink ages ago I never did the pearl on so it's been sitting there for about a year
[4926.36 → 4933.96] with just pink on it so I have to clean it I have to tack cloth it and then I have to oh my god I hope
[4933.96 → 4941.00] I succeed at this do my very first pearl coat I haven't purled anything yet so there's plenty of time
[4941.00 → 4946.92] for me to screw up and have to go back to square one on any number of different parts like I am
[4947.64 → 4950.84] I am many many many hours from completion on this
[4952.36 → 4957.08] oh yeah I pull it just about the one thing I'm kind of noticing is just the
[4960.12 → 4966.76] the kind of like hey I gained 15 points in the polls though sorry I'm listening the time waste bits um
[4966.76 → 4975.16] oh the grind and I mean that's that's a classic you're coming up on some grindtastic parts
[4975.16 → 4981.80] I'll tell you that much like gotcha okay some of the spells that have like 1x growth rate and stuff
[4981.80 → 4993.72] oh um and like being a little bit more intentional about like trying to actually use the esters to
[4993.72 → 5000.20] learn spells okay and back to the completion thing does he have to get the whole party together
[5001.56 → 5007.40] and I'm not even talking about like optional characters like logo and Kumar I'm talking does he
[5007.40 → 5014.84] have to get the world of balance cast back together or can he just like try to take on Kafka's tower with
[5014.84 → 5022.28] like eight people are saying any percent they say any percent you can do whatever you want almost
[5022.28 → 5028.04] everybody's saying no or any percent but interesting to be there's no way Luth's going to play a game like
[5028.04 → 5032.12] that that's hilarious there's I know this man too well I already knew the answer before I asked the
[5032.12 → 5038.76] question there's absolutely no way no shot what was the answer there's no way you're not going to get
[5038.76 → 5044.28] the whole team back together there's just no way I was going to say I'm probably going to do it anyway
[5045.80 → 5050.68] a huge part of what makes this game so special is the ensemble cast and you kind of get attached to
[5050.68 → 5055.16] them he's not gonna not go yeah go get f***ING shadow like you have to be kidding me you saved shadow
[5055.16 → 5063.32] right of course oh good I thought he was going to say who yeah oh no, no no, no no oh that's so funny I got
[5063.32 → 5071.96] a little freaked out about it, i i i did do a little worried save yeah yeah yeah because
[5071.96 → 5078.52] I was like I don't know if this like he might actually just die uh but I'm happy that he doesn't
[5078.52 → 5087.00] uh yeah um so I found I'm gonna I'm i I'm the whole chat said any percent or no but honestly I'm
[5087.00 → 5091.96] I'm going to go get everyone so it doesn't really make a difference for me because I'm planning on
[5091.96 → 5096.28] trying to get everybody I didn't actually that was a I don't care to be clear, but that's a minor
[5096.28 → 5102.20] spoiler because I didn't know if everyone was okay um we should probably do sponsors Dan's hard to sign
[5102.20 → 5108.20] up for like 40 minutes yeah we're just about in wine after dark actually everyone knows I love sandals
[5108.20 → 5114.36] but they just can't offer the same functionality as our sponsor Messi their shoes are breathable
[5114.36 → 5119.64] lightweight and most importantly they help keep your socks dry oh and of course they are more
[5119.64 → 5124.76] fashionable than sandals I mean subjective but sure their weekend sneakers aren't just great for day-to-day
[5124.76 → 5128.92] activities either I actually wore them during my Asia trip not that long ago oh look at that Dennis

[5278.20 → 5286.04] talked about the VPN firm that cancelled lifetime subscriptions because and I quote they didn't know about them
[5286.76 → 5292.60] this is amazing sources Ars Technica i my jaw just about hit the floor when I was reading this
[5292.60 → 5301.32] in March of this year VPN secure customers began complaining online about lifetime subscriptions no
[5301.32 → 5308.44] longer working lifetime subscription holders then began receiving emails that stated lifetime deal
[5308.44 → 5316.44] accounts had been deactivated as of April 28th an email posted on Reddit notes that VPN secure has been
[5316.44 → 5325.32] acquired by new ownership in 2023 in an asset only deal so this new owner acquired the technology domain
[5325.32 → 5329.72] and customer database but not the liabilities that is a direct quote
[5333.64 → 5343.64] what glorious the new ownership claims that the previous owner did not disclose that thousands of Ltd
[5343.64 → 5349.40] or lifetime deals had been sold through platforms like stack social, and they stated that they only
[5349.40 → 5354.84] discovered the lifetime deal accounts months later after finding that their resources were being strained
[5354.84 → 5365.64] by Ltd customers who provided no sustaining income to the service too bad that when you acquire a company
[5366.52 → 5373.24] okay hold on VPN secure sent out an additional email this week reiterating that the acquisition was an
[5373.24 → 5379.72] asset only deal don't you understand it was an asset only deal, and after we reviewed six to
[5379.72 → 5384.92] twelve months of VPN secures previous financials before the purchase the listing profit and loss statements
[5384.92 → 5391.96] and communications never mentioned these lifetime deals yeah, but you see the p and l deal if you see the profit and
[5391.96 → 5397.96] loss then what are we even talking about here if it was an asset only deal it should have quite literally
[5398.68 → 5405.80] cancelled all subscriptions well yeah then they should have no you can't have it both ways you can't have
[5405.80 → 5410.60] the monthly subscriptions but not the lifetime you don't get to pick which customers you acquired
[5412.12 → 5419.40] VPN secure has offered affected users discounted new subscriptions of a dollar 87 a month instead of
[5419.40 → 5427.88] 9.95 19 for a year instead of 80 or 55 for three years instead of 107 until the end of May here's a
[5427.88 → 5434.84] suggestion how about you not buy anything from a company that treats you so disrespectfully
[5436.28 → 5443.48] there's an idea and I'm not even going to poison this segment by mentioning another VPN that you could
[5443.48 → 5449.24] sign up for because that is not the point right now the point right now is don't give them a dime
[5450.76 → 5458.20] not one penny if you weren't worth it to them as a customer who by the way already paid for the service
[5458.20 → 5464.76] then you aren't worth it to them as a customer period that's how this works since March there have
[5464.76 → 5470.76] apparently been 20 pages of one-star reviews on Trustpilot and VPN secure is responding on Trustpilot
[5470.76 → 5477.88] acknowledging it could have communicated better with customers no, no what you could have done is not
[5478.60 → 5479.80] renege on a deal
[5482.68 → 5488.76] yeah I don't think there's a way to communicate this better um I think I'm going to be pissed anyway
[5488.76 → 5490.36] and it also says like
[5493.00 → 5498.20] despite not assuming the previous company's contracts or payments like that doesn't sound right they had
[5498.20 → 5504.36] the monthlies right as far as I know the new ownership says they kept the lifetime accounts
[5504.36 → 5508.84] active for two years as a gesture of goodwill no they didn't notice it you didn't know they made it
[5508.84 → 5513.56] very clear they didn't notice it and then their third message claims the new owners didn't gain
[5513.56 → 5518.76] access to the customer database for months after the acquisition dude i I'm sorry I just don't feel bad
[5518.76 → 5529.32] for you that's i I'm sorry I there's no there is absolutely no right answer here I'm afraid
[5529.32 → 5537.64] other than incredibly low cost of VPN users was worth the 20 pages and hopefully and probably more one
[5537.64 → 5545.64] star reviews you're having now idiots who's f1 says Luke would you sue the company if you had a lifetime sub
[5545.64 → 5559.72] uh come on we all know the answer no yeah it's so much work, and it's probably so expensive
[5560.60 → 5566.76] yeah basically, and it's like I think that's something that a lot of people don't necessarily
[5566.76 → 5573.80] consider is that it's really easy to make a video about how you're suing someone or whatever
[5573.80 → 5580.04] actually following through on it like to the point where there's an actual judgment and or
[5580.04 → 5586.92] settlement of some sort that's like it's its a ton of work, and it's boring no one's interested
[5586.92 → 5593.32] in if it's not content anymore only the initial announcement you know the big bombshell is content
[5593.32 → 5597.48] nothing else is content so it's just going to die um
[5597.48 → 5605.16] um, and it's just it, and it's like you gotta weigh the cost benefit right like what is Luke
[5605.16 → 5611.72] owed dozens of dollars what's it gonna cost to have even an exploratory call with a lawyer
[5613.64 → 5619.72] come on yeah if somebody already set up a class action lawsuit people are asking if I would
[5619.72 → 5626.20] join that, and it's like even then man like what am I going to get from it like if I'm going to click one button
[5628.44 → 5633.00] I don't know sure I think the honestly the biggest impact thing that I could do
[5633.88 → 5641.40] is to obviously never bring them my business again go somewhere else leave that one-star review and try
[5641.40 → 5648.28] to get as many other people to do the same because if they have one-star reviews everywhere like if it's
[5648.28 → 5654.12] if like you know there's trust pilot but if they also have one-star reviews on I'm assuming their on
[5654.12 → 5659.32] the app stores and everything else if they have just one-star reviews everywhere then that's it
[5659.32 → 5666.20] unless they do a major rebrand which is going to cost them a huge amount of money um and kind of ruin
[5666.20 → 5669.64] a huge part of the reason why they bought this company anyway um
[5672.92 → 5678.92] they're just like screwed there's so many VPNs out there people aren't going to just go to the
[5678.92 → 5686.76] the one star one constantly um, so people are talking about small claims court I can't speak
[5686.76 → 5692.92] to every other jurisdiction but small claims court here is intended for like local defendants
[5693.80 → 5700.84] like i I can't take some like Israeli, or you know Chinese company to small claims court like that
[5700.84 → 5708.60] come on they would have under what authority am I going to summon them to the courthouse like that
[5708.60 → 5717.24] that's the thing right like if it's not happening um anyway someone says in the US you can okay well
[5717.24 → 5724.44] that's great and I wish you luck with that um but yeah here it's woefully impractical
[5724.44 → 5731.00] yeah yeah I don't know the nice voice crack I don't know the uh the country lines thing like
[5731.00 → 5739.64] we're only could be aware of our local stuff and even than barely if I'm being completely honest
[5739.64 → 5743.96] inception boy says if they don't show up then the judge sides with you in small claims court yeah
[5743.96 → 5751.80] that's nice but so what how am I going to actually get anything from them is the judge also going
[5751.80 → 5757.96] to like to get on a plane and go to their headquarters and like rough them up if they don't pay it definitely
[5757.96 → 5767.48] going to go get my yeah what are we it's not it's not actually that simple to actually get the money
[5767.48 → 5778.84] out of someone that supposedly has lost in small claims court um all right what else we got
[5778.84 → 5788.36] this week do we want to talk about some good news yeah this is so cool uh here I'm gonna I'm gonna fire
[5788.36 → 5798.52] up the promo that uh Phillips did let's go this is like dude how is a company this big doing something
[5798.52 → 5806.68] this cool I was stunned to be honest is this is real this is real that is incredible this is real
[5806.68 → 5813.16] fixable dude they partnered with Brusa this was the point of 3d printing when it was first like
[5813.16 → 5820.20] coming onto the scene like a decade ago dude so you could just like oh my god you could just make
[5820.20 → 5825.24] Phillips compatible like replacement pieces and adapters, and they've got a whole thing like look
[5826.28 → 5832.20] dude this is so cool they've got they've got just a freaking Brusa in the promo for if it's like
[5832.20 → 5838.68] the best news a wan shows ever had right this is genuinely incredibly cool they will have my
[5838.68 → 5845.08] business for this reason i yeah 30 years ago yeah dude I don't know anything I okay I don't know
[5845.08 → 5851.24] anything I don't know much about Phillips right in the last you know 10 years what have they done
[5851.24 → 5858.68] that's been on my radar they have overpriced light bulbs um I don't know they have like oh we use them
[5858.68 → 5864.76] here the ran set has the Philips Hue sure right but like have they done anything
[5865.48 → 5870.92] that has even remotely seemed this cool that has shown up on your guy's radar in the last decade
[5873.40 → 5879.24] definitely not but I don't think anyone in the spaces that Phillips operates in has
[5879.24 → 5884.20] either to defend them a little oh no, no I'm not attacking them I'm not attacking them I'm just
[5884.20 → 5889.16] I'm just making it clear for other people they do a lot of healthcare stuff dude this came
[5889.72 → 5898.60] completely out of nowhere for me oh me too and I was just so I was so excited to see this that i just
[5898.60 → 5903.00] didn't I don't I don't really know what else to say other than this is super cool so they've teamed up
[5903.00 → 5908.92] with Brusa research to launch Phillips fixable aiming to encourage self-repair of Phillips products
[5908.92 → 5914.36] using 3d printed replacement components which will be available on printables.com Phillips will
[5914.36 → 5920.20] include recommended print settings to ensure that your 3d printed parts are sturdy enough to be a
[5920.20 → 5924.60] long-term solution and there's only one design so far but the website and promo videos show additional
[5924.60 → 5930.36] 3d printed parts for Phillips grooming products and users are able to submit requests for specific parts
[5930.36 → 5938.04] if they're not already available so it's baby steps right now that's sick in the infancy but right now
[5938.92 → 5945.32] if this is what it seems to be on the surface I am so amped and this is enough for to significantly
[5945.32 → 5952.04] sway my purchase decisions between like a Phillips something or an oral b that thing, or you know a
[5952.04 → 5957.72] morello shaver or a Phillips shaver like I am you know I'm so in same here so in same here you know
[5957.72 → 5961.88] what's interesting is people are talking about how apparently it's like trending on thingies or
[5961.88 → 5970.12] whatever already um i i I wonder if this could be an interesting way to inform um like
[5972.04 → 5978.92] product development uh because if you see that one part oh in comparison to all the other ones that
[5978.92 → 5984.20] you're you're offering if they don't mind this really often they're crazy yeah you're like wow this one
[5984.20 → 5988.28] part seems to be breaking a lot let's let's re-engineer that a little bit on the next model and make it
[5988.28 → 5996.52] better or like everyone and their dog prints uh a number five and a half you know uh, uh buzz cut
[5996.52 → 6003.24] we should add that that should be in the standard kit you know dude that this is cash money
[6003.24 → 6008.76] or I hope it is that's so killer this kind of behaviour should absolutely be rewarded it will affect
[6008.76 → 6013.32] my purchase decisions easily if there's a Phillips equivalent to something else I'm reaching for the
[6013.32 → 6018.60] Phillips panda says Phillips is morello law okay well fine branding works then I guess they've
[6018.60 → 6024.12] indoctrinated me um someone in full plane chat also said that they're in the market for a new beard
[6024.12 → 6028.28] trimmer, and they're going to get a Phillips one now because of it this is like this is where you know
[6028.28 → 6035.48] voting with your wallet works both ways right yeah and I hate how often it has to be like a negative
[6035.48 → 6041.32] message this is exciting this is an opportunity for us to support this personally send a
[6041.32 → 6046.36] positive message like gives me hope for the future I was actually um I went as far as ordering the
[6046.36 → 6052.12] replacement battery for my um my electric toothbrush I think it's an I want to say it's an oral b or
[6052.12 → 6057.64] something like that and I was so I was so annoyed to discover how difficult it is to replace the battery
[6057.64 → 6062.04] in it but I found out it's possible and then I had like a video title idea in my mind that was like
[6062.60 → 6068.20] um my toothbrush shouldn't be this hard to fix, and the idea was I was going to do like a handful of
[6068.20 → 6072.52] little fixes around the house that were like rejuvenating things, and then we did that sponsored
[6072.52 → 6078.52] thing with um what's their nuts uh, uh life and or something like that and I started using that
[6078.52 → 6082.20] toothbrush and then I got distracted by some other shiny video project and then we so we never ended
[6082.20 → 6090.36] up doing the video but um having had that experience with that other toothbrush and then seeing Phillips's
[6090.36 → 6096.20] attitude here there's just absolutely no question that I would consider a brand that built that kind of
[6096.20 → 6101.40] impossible to repair ability into their toothbrush anymore I just wouldn't even consider it anymore
[6102.44 → 6105.08] yeah um
[6107.80 → 6113.96] all right I'm looking them up right now because I'm not, i wasn't actually sure of the brand of my
[6113.96 → 6119.48] toothbrush and shaver and it i I guess I'm already in the Phillips ecosystem, so there's not a ton more i
[6119.48 → 6129.56] can do all right let's go uh but hey they'll have continued um purchases for me, I guess over time
[6129.56 → 6136.52] well I mean we're in a unique position where there's definitely things that we can do you know yeah yeah
[6136.52 → 6142.52] yeah so at least there's that um so you know back to the VPN thing and this you know we could talk about
[6142.52 → 6148.36] it on the land show yeah yeah yeah that hopefully makes a difference all right what else we
[6148.36 → 6159.00] got this week energy star going down I want to talk about podcasters not wanting public play counts
[6160.04 → 6167.08] Spotify this is funny to me Spotify has responded to podcaster backlash over the plays feature that
[6167.08 → 6173.88] was announced last week plays was announced as a new publicly visible metric of how many times an
[6173.88 → 6180.20] episode of a podcast has been actively watched or listened to rounded to the nearest thousand
[6180.20 → 6186.12] Spotify said this would help users attract new audiences, but podcasters were quick to criticize
[6186.12 → 6191.88] the feature with most feeling that plays would give additional promotion to podcasts that already have
[6191.88 → 6198.92] large audiences and make small shows less appealing to new listeners Spotify announced changes earlier
[6198.92 → 6206.04] today updating the program so plays only start to be displayed after 50 000 plays and will only update
[6206.04 → 6216.12] at specific milestones instead of being more granular so Luke what do you think about this I feel like
[6216.12 → 6223.40] their update might be worse uh because now people are just going to see look at all the
[6223.40 → 6233.40] thousand above yeah discard everything else which is like so bad um wow yeah i I feel like that's like
[6233.40 → 6240.76] the worst pivot they could have almost possibly done um I'm not I feel like in a weird way I'm not super
[6240.76 → 6247.96] surprised that some podcasters don't want to show the play count uh yeah I have got oh I've got so many
[6247.96 → 6255.88] thoughts about that but yes carry on yeah I mean a lot of that comes down to podcast ad rates being like
[6255.88 → 6263.08] super, super high for some reason compared to any other form of media which I've never understood and
[6263.08 → 6271.72] now I'm wondering if it's because play counts are hidden um as far as I can tell the entire model
[6271.72 → 6281.16] for podcast advertising which yes to your point commands an astonishing CPM compared to like
[6281.16 → 6289.56] compared to video which makes no sense to me absolutely no sense um the only difference as far
[6289.56 → 6296.28] as I can tell and the reason that podcasting commands this extremely high rate is that it has this air
[6296.28 → 6306.44] of like um exclusivities or not exclusivity but like uh professionalism slash old media that it has somehow
[6306.44 → 6314.36] carried over from the radio days and a lot of relationships with radio advertisers moved into the
[6314.36 → 6323.08] podcasting space and because it uses a lot of the same bullshit metrics that newspapers and magazines
[6323.08 → 6331.72] and radio did to calculate their reach so podcasting advertisers as far as I can tell have just been
[6332.44 → 6341.88] bamboozled for years and years and years into paying rates that make absolutely no sense as far as I can tell
[6341.88 → 6349.96] like i I have seen the numbers that agencies have floated by us for what they think a podcast that is
[6349.96 → 6356.52] equivalently sized to the wan show might be able to bring in and I'm looking at it going like this is more
[6356.52 → 6368.12] than we do in AdSense sponsor integrations and like merch sales like what is even what is even going on
[6368.12 → 6375.56] right now, but it's very, very old media the way that the podcasting advertising space works and I guarantee
[6375.56 → 6383.48] you the last thing they want is transparency in terms of seeing how many people are actually listening
[6383.48 → 6389.00] to any of this, and it's its something that I've tried to its something I've tried to figure out multiple
[6389.00 → 6394.84] times because every once in a while I will have someone reach out and invite me onto their podcast
[6394.84 → 6400.44] and one of the things that I will try to figure out is and like look I'm not I'm not trying to be rude
[6400.44 → 6410.68] or anything but is this a real podcast you know or is this just like a dude and his friend who bought a
[6410.68 → 6416.20] snowball and this is like their first episode like that happens I'm trying to do I'm trying to do a little
[6416.20 → 6424.28] bit of due diligence to make sure that I am optimizing my time um, and you know so i I don't I have done
[6424.28 → 6430.92] I have done interview requests with very, very small publications in the past and I have turned down
[6430.92 → 6436.04] very big ones it's not a hard and fast rule it's not just like oh well like are you big enough or
[6436.04 → 6441.56] it's its not like that but I also like to do my due diligence because there have been times when I've
[6441.56 → 6447.08] collaborated with people and not done due diligence in the past that haven't worked out so great um
[6447.64 → 6453.32] so i, so basically there have been multiple times that I've kind of sat down and I've looked at a podcast and gone okay
[6453.96 → 6462.28] is anybody actually listening to this it is flipping impossible to tell how big one podcast is
[6462.28 → 6468.68] compared to another one unless it's like you know the top ranked you know handful per category or per
[6468.68 → 6474.92] country or whatever like there are some metrics but even then it is tough to know which ones are relevant
[6474.92 → 6485.32] people are talking about like Fallon and stuff okay no, no no not not related to that
[6485.96 → 6493.96] uh yeah not a big enough podcast I think no gonna need to going to need to question that one so i have to
[6493.96 → 6501.64] tell you as an advertiser you're probably coming up against the same information wall where you just
[6502.28 → 6510.44] cannot tell if anybody is actually consuming this media or not and what I suspect is that the vast
[6510.44 → 6520.68] majority of podcasts are just part of a roster of podcasts or like an an a bundle of podcasts that are
[6520.68 → 6528.44] being sold by agencies some of which are performing but most of which absolutely nobody is listening to
[6528.44 → 6536.68] and do not want anybody to know that nobody is listening to if it's also extremely easy to
[6537.64 → 6540.36] these days, and it has been for
[6540.36 → 6550.04] a while now probably four years five years maybe uh it's been extremely easy to make a very
[6550.04 → 6556.60] professional looking and honestly decently professional sounding podcast yeah um with some of
[6556.60 → 6563.64] the solutions that are out there you put that yes you some people were listened to Luke today that's not
[6563.64 → 6574.12] my fault I didn't blame you took it personally were copying the Joe Rogan setup for a while
[6574.12 → 6578.12] and these days it seems to be more of the Andrew Huberman one where it's that like
[6578.92 → 6585.48] spaced out wooden slat wall with the the the black behind it um they're all like sitting on a couch
[6585.48 → 6593.56] a very plain table, and then you have two like SMB's and if you can buy that and a like a two
[6593.56 → 6600.44] mic audio interface which you can do because of the road casters like everything's kind of like
[6600.44 → 6605.96] solved for people now um legato can get you your lights and things really quickly and easily
[6606.84 → 6611.48] when we were first doing this it was weird complicated steal things from the audio industry
[6611.48 → 6618.76] try to make it work science, and now it's uh, or you know actual training which we didn't have
[6619.64 → 6624.84] yeah yeah and if you have a tiny bedroom or a tiny room it's much easier to treat you know yeah and if
[6624.84 → 6632.68] you don't do video oh, oh easy yeah but even what my point is even doing the video side which is
[6632.68 → 6639.32] I think uh actually I think there's something there i am lot of these smaller podcasts have been doing
[6639.32 → 6645.56] video these days and I think it's on purpose and I think it's because you can achieve that professional look
[6645.56 → 6652.68] quite easily um and then if you can get in one of these bundles or if you can at least if you can
[6652.68 → 6658.36] make yourself look professional or whatever if you can pay to have a very reputable guest come on um
[6658.36 → 6662.20] even if you're not getting a ton of views if you can get some clips from it if you can get whatever
[6662.20 → 6668.60] else you can make yourself look very popular um there was some proof not that long ago that
[6668.60 → 6677.08] people were making fake podcasts uh and using that to promote products I don't know if you've heard
[6677.08 → 6682.68] about this, but they would make these podcast looking sets with these the wooden slats in the background
[6682.68 → 6688.84] with the black behind the wooden slats maybe a fake little IKEA plant the SMB's wooden table people
[6688.84 → 6694.68] facing each other it wouldn't even be a real podcast it would just be two people talking about like yeah
[6694.68 → 6698.52] this thing like changed my life whatever blah blah blah blah blah, and it would look like a discussion
[6698.52 → 6705.64] but it was a like a shadow advertisement it's its fake influencers pretending that they're having a
[6705.64 → 6710.84] podcast, and they're just naturally talking about something, but they're not they're advertising very
[6710.84 → 6716.44] specifically for a product that was a huge thing for a while that became a thing because achieving this
[6716.44 → 6723.08] professional looking podcast look became relatively I know I'm saying cheap when it's a few thousand
[6723.08 → 6729.72] dollars but relatively cheap and easy for how much money you can gain back from it yes exactly yeah
[6729.72 → 6733.88] that's why you see that a lot on ticktock yeah I don't know I don't use ticktock but that I know
[6733.88 → 6738.52] that was a thing for quite a while I'm not surprised it's still a thing um and when you know that the
[6738.52 → 6744.36] barrier of entry is that low if you can use that low barrier of entry to get into the podcasting space
[6744.36 → 6752.76] and then hide under a non-reported play count like I promise you people are gaming that system i I would bet
[6753.08 → 6759.48] very solid cash that people would be gaming that system anyway i fully as someone who has had to
[6760.68 → 6768.52] claw my way for every bit of recognition do you have any idea how hard it was
[6769.48 → 6775.80] to sell sponsorships against YouTube videos 13 years ago well especially when you were effectively the
[6775.80 → 6781.96] first one doing it do you have any idea how hard that was and like the craziest part to me back in
[6781.96 → 6791.24] the day was like I had metrics and I'm up against these guys that have no metrics as far as I can tell
[6791.88 → 6798.12] nobody is actually watching any of it and I see the kinds of deals and budgets that they're getting and
[6798.12 → 6805.72] I'm just like this is insane just completely stop writing their checks sign them over to me and
[6805.72 → 6811.40] immediately watch your ROI go up but it took a decade it took a decade for people to figure it
[6811.40 → 6817.24] out and a lot of them still haven't so as someone who had to actually have all of my performance
[6817.24 → 6822.76] completely transparent to every brand and every viewer that I've ever engaged with every collaborator
[6822.76 → 6831.80] that I've ever worked with I support it put play counts on it yeah yeah I've got our podcast metrics
[6831.80 → 6837.00] here if you want any insight, or you want me to share any insight but are they real who knows
[6838.68 → 6844.52] do they report we don't get a ton on the listening side which is we do we get 75
[6845.00 → 6851.40] over the video side of our Spotify I actually have no idea what our podcast numbers are sorry
[6851.40 → 6855.96] are Dan are you talking about them right now yeah do you have a guess how many uh that's a
[6855.96 → 6861.32] lot higher than I thought how many streams have you have we done this year like when show streams yeah
[6861.32 → 6869.88] year I mean like 20 or whatever oh sorry uh how many streams views downloads there's
[6869.88 → 6875.40] there's kind of a complicated way to categorize we've had about 20 episodes right and then every episode
[6875.40 → 6881.88] does anywhere from half a million to three quarters of a million on YouTube generally we had kind of a
[6881.88 → 6885.72] rough week last week and I think this week's going to be pretty rough I think we did not nail the title
[6885.72 → 6892.60] of this one but whatever we do our best um so that would be you know 10 million or whatever on YouTube
[6892.60 → 6899.24] so let's say I literally have no idea uh let's say
[6902.04 → 6906.04] Spotify I don't know I don't even subscribe to Spotify I don't even like you remember podcast goes
[6906.04 → 6913.08] out to everywhere where there is podcast is like a really cool format um two million two
[6913.08 → 6920.04] million almost exactly two million streams oh okay yeah it was very bang on okay well then that's fine I guess
[6920.04 → 6926.20] and like a quarter of that are watching because we do video for Spotify okay I didn't even know
[6926.20 → 6930.84] my life makes my life so much easier not a lot of people do it was a new feature that they were
[6930.84 → 6938.28] testing for a while so 75 percent listen about 25 seem to watch huh um that might be a Spotify only
[6938.28 → 6944.76] thing and podcasts go to literally anywhere like it goes on iTunes or anywhere um because it's RSS
[6944.76 → 6949.96] feed based and that's a funny thing because then super cool that makes us a huge YouTube
[6949.96 → 6955.80] tech live stream we're but actually one of the largest podcast oh see that's the thing these
[6955.80 → 6961.56] numbers are so small to me, I just assumed that we're a small podcast it's very interesting no we're
[6961.56 → 6966.84] one of the large ones I think the because of the barrier for entry is so low now and like most people
[6966.84 → 6971.80] aren't doing what we do which is the bad way to do it which is just record it live and then send it
[6971.80 → 6978.60] without doing any mastering pass at all yeah whatever so we try our best um do we though yeah no yeah
[6978.60 → 6983.56] if you how much more money do you want to spend on this we could make it no we don't want to we
[6983.56 → 6988.44] don't want to try our best no you don't try our best, and we don't want you do not want to it
[6988.44 → 6996.36] will cost you an arm and a leg um but like 25 of people finish a quarter of an episode five percent
[6996.36 → 7001.56] finish three quarters of an episode and three percent almost finish all of it that's terrible
[7002.44 → 7005.96] so that's just like a complete waste of time, and we shouldn't even bother uploading them then
[7005.96 → 7012.68] no it's pretty it's pretty useful is it okay for reasons how do i how I won't go into so here
[7013.08 → 7017.56] I'm so here I'm it's good I'm going to try and do this good I'm going to try and do this okay so I'm
[7017.56 → 7023.56] I am trying to find top tech podcast so i because Dan pulled this statement as far as I can
[7023.56 → 7030.44] tell completely out of his butt that we are one of the bigger tech podcasts and I'm I'm looking at this
[7030.44 → 7037.48] and I'm going how are you supposed to know that is can you hear me yes okay my computer's doing
[7037.48 → 7045.56] that thing so I'll be back okay I will meet you top shows okay so these are these the top technology
[7045.56 → 7057.96] podcasts uh like verge I know the verge I know Ted is that a tech podcast though a lot of Ted stuff
[7057.96 → 7065.56] is kind of tech wait these are just top episodes why is this why is this so obtuse I tried to okay
[7065.56 → 7069.96] top shows okay here we go uh
[7073.80 → 7081.40] yeah dude we're tiny unless we're not depends on the category it can be a little bit complicated i
[7081.40 → 7088.20] mean we do get rankings for us um and this is specifically on apple pie because we haven't even
[7088.20 → 7095.48] dude we haven't even shown up yet dude when show when shows not even top 100 according to this
[7096.12 → 7100.28] maybe not of all time but certainly in the tech sector I know that we're up there, but this is tech
[7100.28 → 7108.52] oh wait charts genre yeah genre 13 18 I mean we got Linux unplugged see now though now we're getting to
[7108.52 → 7116.12] the point where I'm having a hard time believing and I don't want to call anybody in particular out okay
[7117.08 → 7124.60] so wan show no okay yeah I'm having a hard time believing okay I look I don't want to call I don't
[7124.60 → 7130.04] want to call anybody out but who is Logan Bartlett I just want to know who Logan Bartlett is that 4.8
[7130.04 → 7135.96] stars that's perfect apparently this is perfect there's the internet is full of influencers
[7135.96 → 7145.16] I've never heard of so it's nothing personal Logan Bartlett okay so the buddy uploads on YouTube
[7146.12 → 7159.08] and has some very, very popular videos uh first interview with Sam Altman after GPT 4.0 okay so
[7159.08 → 7160.36] that's that's pretty cool
[7163.32 → 7169.24] I'm not sure if I believe that this podcast is bigger than ours though based on the numbers I'm
[7169.24 → 7174.52] looking at, but that's the thing is some of the splits are obscene yeah i I look at everything
[7174.52 → 7182.28] through a YouTube lens like I'm YouTube native and everything else is just like well okay not everything
[7182.28 → 7186.76] else but
[7187.64 → 7193.88] same way that someone will be like big on Instagram and I'll be like are they actually big and then
[7193.88 → 7197.72] check their like YouTube because again I'm YouTube first and then I have to take a step back and be
[7197.72 → 7204.28] like oh wait no this is an Instagram first creator if this person is a podcast first or
[7204.28 → 7208.76] yeah, or you know Spotify first creator then
[7210.84 → 7215.72] yeah I mean think about something like twitch you know if you have six concurrent viewers
[7215.72 → 7220.12] you're in top percentages if the barrier for entry for podcasts is so low, and you can just like
[7220.76 → 7225.80] sit down and upload whatever you want you know if you're oh if you're in the top 10 000 you're
[7225.80 → 7232.76] doing pretty okay Eddie cold rick oh so we're not under tech we're under tech news I'm working on it
[7232.76 → 7238.20] yeah I can't, I can't find our rankings that we're in the top 10.
[7243.16 → 7246.92] and there's also tech news the funny us tech news UK that sort of thing
[7247.96 → 7252.12] I haven't heard of some of the other things that are in the top 10.
[7252.12 → 7255.48] yeah I think we talked about these ages ago if you remember when we were starting into this
[7256.52 → 7262.20] who are these people, and they're more popular by us by like a large margin I pretty much guarantee
[7262.20 → 7268.44] you that a lot of them say the same thing about us, I'm sure I'm 100 sure who the heck are these guys
[7268.44 → 7273.88] I mean their show isn't even professional look at this yeah this is terrible garbage this
[7273.88 → 7277.00] actual trash actual dumpster fire
[7279.00 → 7284.60] I said that dude clearly just woke it woke up he didn't even do his hair what's happening that is the
[7284.60 → 7288.76] least of our problems you're wearing you're wearing a gaming headset made if it's like
[7290.36 → 7298.92] it's not even a good gaming headset oh I have RGB on it oh man uh okay no mastering pass on the audio
[7298.92 → 7305.72] a lot of podcasts like you know if is there is no real time master it's awful um if you're only
[7305.72 → 7311.08] listening to the audio it's nice to have it actually like sound good we are number six after
[7311.08 → 7318.76] cybersecurity headlines Babbage cyberwire daily 404 media them I know and the tech news briefing from
[7318.76 → 7325.96] the Wall Street journal, and they are way bigger how do you remember though I remember looking at some
[7325.96 → 7330.76] charts that we like I haven't touched podcasting in a while but where do these charts come from
[7330.76 → 7335.72] like do you have to pay someone for the charts well we get charts because we're special because
[7335.72 → 7344.52] we're one of the larger podcasters um wait whoa whoa as a larger podcaster you get intel
[7344.52 → 7350.68] on the other podcasters, but that's not available publicly I get like well I don't know I remember
[7351.32 → 7357.64] I remember getting a weekly like digest email that said that we're we're better, and it is like that's
[7357.64 → 7361.56] your billboard 100. Everyone should have access to that
[7364.20 → 7372.92] I mean charitable there we are um let's see and is this like real data like are you getting this from
[7372.92 → 7378.44] yeah like where's this from yeah I think everyone's just guessing dude it could be lies
[7379.16 → 7383.64] let me see if I can actually open like here we can see how many people we can see how many people like
[7383.64 → 7389.80] rated it that's something like how many people rated the wan show let's have a look at our dashboard
[7389.80 → 7395.64] wow I don't know I don't know if I agree I don't think it's that good but thank you it's very generous
[7395.64 → 7400.36] let's go is this just buy ratings no because this one only has 123 ratings
[7403.56 → 7409.88] what one uh the cybersecurity because I'm not super surprised because that has like the most generic name
[7409.88 → 7414.84] and profile photo yeah, but apparently they're they're bigger, but they also upload daily
[7415.80 → 7421.40] oh so that's a daily podcast so that's that's a volume game and a half right there
[7422.12 → 7427.08] I could see following that though yeah for sure security daily like how many
[7427.08 → 7434.92] audios you can listen to it on the way to work like I could absolutely see 1400 episodes
[7434.92 → 7441.40] so this is one I got from last year because I think they're blocked in our email thing now okay
[7441.40 → 7452.44] but for apple podcasts were number eight for tech news in the U.S. number 211 for Great Britain for news
[7453.16 → 7459.96] number seven for Great Britain for tech news 146 in Canada for news number two in Canada for tech
[7459.96 → 7466.44] news that's on apple podcast sure i I don't know I think it's all made up and I support more transparency
[7467.16 → 7477.48] all right uh there are some ohs there are some new android scam protections and this video is not out
[7477.48 → 7484.44] yet, but we did a collaboration with kit yoga recently that was a lot of fun and was both eye-opening
[7484.44 → 7491.08] and also extremely terrifying i it's not something I dedicate a lot of my brain cycles to it's not
[7491.08 → 7498.52] something that I have really experienced with my aging relatives but there are so many different angles
[7498.52 → 7507.88] of attack from scammers that i just never heard of and he really kind of like I don't know um
[7507.88 → 7516.68] um he kind of red-pilled me okay so i I get it now I am I i am now aware of what's out there
[7516.68 → 7522.04] and the world is trash, and it's full of people who are trash and are going to try and
[7522.04 → 7527.32] take everything from you for no reason other than that you have it, and they don't and that sucks and
[7527.32 → 7535.00] thank you very much kit I appreciate you very much anyway at android Io this week google announced
[7535.00 → 7542.36] new tools in android 16 aimed at protecting users from such scams they have new in call protections
[7542.36 → 7548.12] that prevent users from taking risky actions such as granting accessibility permissions or sideloading
[7548.12 → 7556.28] an app for the first time if you are a new oh yeah if you are in call that is super cool that's a way for
[7556.28 → 7563.88] android to stay open and allow sideloading and allow special accessibility permissions but not allow
[7563.88 → 7570.28] somebody to get you to do that while you are on a phone call with them so that seems pretty neat
[7570.92 → 7575.80] if you are screen sharing during a phone call android will now automatically prompt you to stop
[7575.80 → 7580.52] sharing at the end of the call, and they're piloting a program in the UK were launching a participating
[7580.52 → 7585.08] banking app while screen sharing with an unknown contact will trigger a warning from android and give
[7585.08 → 7591.16] you the option to end the call and stop screen sharing with one tap scam detection is an ai-powered
[7591.16 → 7595.24] tool for scam detection and text that will warn when it spots suspicious conversation patterns
[7595.24 → 7600.52] and key verifier allows you and the person you're messaging to verify the identity of the other party
[7600.52 → 7607.80] through public encryption keys to help thwart imposters e.g. sim swaps my only concern here is that
[7607.80 → 7620.04] um the kinds of users who from working with kit on that video seem to be targeted by these folks may not be
[7620.04 → 7627.96] helped that much by this it seems like they are accustomed to a very unsophisticated non-savvy
[7627.96 → 7636.20] user like I was amazed at how dense we had to pretend to be in order to get them to hang up on us um
[7637.88 → 7647.64] like Luke I asked this one guy to sing me happy birthday um proof and Adam both succeeded in getting
[7647.64 → 7653.88] the scammer to sing them happy birthday uh I asked mine who's your daddy and what does he do
[7653.88 → 7664.76] that wasn't enough to deter him um like so the angle for the video for so you guys know what to
[7664.76 → 7669.72] expect it's going to be dude it's going to be a blast I think we shot two videos uh one for our channel
[7669.72 → 7673.72] one for kits I think or both for our channel I don't know we did something I think we did one for
[7673.72 → 7678.20] I think the other one was for kit's channel anyway the point was I just went where they told me to go and i
[7678.20 → 7684.44] I was a on camera anyway um so for ours we try to make the unscalable pc and then yeah the one
[7684.44 → 7689.96] that I think is going live on his channel is just him having us compete to see who can keep scammers
[7689.96 → 7695.08] on for the longest so it's me proof Adam and Elijah and kit if I recall correctly all five of us took a
[7695.08 → 7702.52] whack at it, I might have some of these details wrong but uh the point is the um the shtick for it was that
[7702.52 → 7708.04] we don't just keep them on the phone because honestly that's relatively easy you have someone off camera
[7708.04 → 7713.48] holding up a piece of paper with stuff you have to say stuff that you have to insert in the
[7713.48 → 7721.24] conversation so that's where some of these like wackadoodle things who's your daddy um you have to
[7721.24 → 7727.24] tell them you're so lonely um no one came to my birthday party will you be my friend you have to
[7727.24 → 7737.80] ask if their mom's single like just oh so painful anyway it's going to be great it's going to be
[7737.80 → 7744.44] great oh that's exciting don't miss it so a cool new android scan protections seems like progress but
[7745.16 → 7749.96] it's also hard to look at this and say anything but like feels like too little too late but let's
[7749.96 → 7755.80] see how it goes uh rogue rig reboot is back we are excited to announce that we have once again partnered
[7755.80 → 7760.68] with Asus to give our viewers the opportunity to be flown to Linus media group headquarters where they will
[7760.68 → 7767.56] build a pc with me on video we are opening up to our international audience this time so all you got to
[7767.56 → 7775.56] do is go to leg.GG slash rig 25 submit a video showing us why you need a rig reboot whether your

[7808.12 → 7814.76] also we have a float plane update this week our handsome tall intelligent rich and narcissistic chief
[7814.76 → 7821.08] vision officer Linus Sebastian had his latest vision we're trying out something new on float plane
[7821.08 → 7826.76] clips these are quick behind the scenes moments that aren't quite long enough to be a full float plane
[7826.76 → 7838.04] exclusive open this link to just show what it is explained if needed okay ah yes Linus and Elijah discuss my
[7838.04 → 7844.44] little pony oh I have already watched this so it started at the end we talk about our favourite ponies
[7844.44 → 7846.44] and people apparently liked that
[7851.32 → 7854.28] anyway you guys loved the first one so we're going to keep it going during computer
[7854.28 → 7856.84] just yell yikes from the background
[7859.00 → 7862.52] some of our team will be on the ground next week uploading random clips as they happen
[7864.12 → 7868.68] you may see things like eating stinky tofu for the first time silly stuff on the show floor and
[7868.68 → 7872.44] everything in between and yes Luke will apparently be doing his traditional show floor walk
[7872.44 → 7878.28] uh Sammy says totally announcing this so Luke makes time for me to do a show floor walk with him
[7878.28 → 7884.44] oh okay so Sammy had not discussed this with you no he asked me like a while ago if I would do it and
[7884.44 → 7894.92] I was like yeah, and then he asked me again today and I was like yeah so I think he forgot that i
[7894.92 → 7903.08] I already agreed to it nice uh okay so check out the leg team during computer at leg.GG
[7903.08 → 7911.96] slash flow plane all right what else we got today okay, okay I'm confused by this Luke help me out here
[7913.00 → 7920.04] source here's Ars Technica industry groups decry the imminent demise of energy star uh the current
[7920.04 → 7925.00] U.S. administration has decided to terminate the energy star program though it's not clear if
[7925.00 → 7930.68] energy star can be limited eliminated without an act of congress energy star is a program run by the
[7930.68 → 7935.56] U.S. environmental protection agency the EPA and the department of energy the doe to help consumers
[7935.56 → 7939.40] businesses and industry save money and protect the environment by using energy efficient products and
[7939.40 → 7944.28] practices it identifies top performing cost-effective products homes and buildings through its distinctive blue
[7944.28 → 7952.44] label okay what I asked for in this topic was an ELI 5 for energy star because other than seeing the
[7952.44 → 7961.24] label on things and being like okay so that's a that I guess it's energy i never really knew what exactly
[7961.96 → 7970.52] it meant that this one is like more ranked or good or for the efficiency but also a lot of the
[7970.52 → 7974.60] time it seemed kind of arbitrary because it's like yeah this one's terrible for power efficiency but
[7974.60 → 7981.56] also it's like on the much bigger end of like how big TVs can be in this category so obviously you know
[7981.56 → 7987.64] like I okay so that's what it is a voluntary program that was created as part of a bill passed by
[7988.28 → 7994.76] the uh near the end of George Hugh bush's time in office president Clinton issued an executive order
[7994.76 → 7998.52] mandating that federal agencies should prioritize energy star certified products in their procurement
[7998.52 → 8004.36] chamber of commerce something um energy star enabled consumers to save an estimated 500
[8004.36 → 8009.08] billion dollars over the past 33 years Ars Technica notes that companies that have invested
[8009.08 → 8013.40] in making more efficient products are faced with the loss of the energy star brand as a marketing tool
[8013.40 → 8018.60] oh this is why they care okay the energy star logo has helped them make the case with the
[8018.60 → 8022.68] government support that the initial cost of efficient appliances will be offset over time
[8022.68 → 8032.20] in reduced water and energy consumption got it I was trying to figure out why industry groups cared
[8032.20 → 8039.80] about energy star going away, so the answer is marketing hit me you guys in the chat do you
[8040.52 → 8047.56] do you factor energy star into your purchases because i have to confess other than like seeing it in my bios or
[8047.56 → 8054.84] whatever i i i i I can't say that it's been a major factor for me, it's its something that I see on the
[8054.84 → 8061.48] product after I buy it essentially every single time and almost all chad is saying no but remember we
[8061.48 → 8067.08] actually haven't seen anyone in chat say we live in bc where our electricity is cheap right yeah so that's
[8067.08 → 8073.72] something yeah states have some of their own regulations as well I mean yeah my wife does okay
[8073.72 → 8079.88] and especially if it impacts like government procurement then I could see it affecting a
[8079.88 → 8086.20] significant number of units that are purchased even if it's not individual consumers I have for larger appliances
[8087.24 → 8093.24] I prefer it all else being equal I have okay I like to see it there oh interesting
[8094.68 → 8101.88] yeet dab man says that sticker is a real POS to remove I'd say no for appliances heck yes
[8101.88 → 8110.60] interesting I love that there are consumer rebates based on energy star in some jurisdictions okay
[8110.60 → 8114.76] so maybe this is just more of like Americans have a higher level of awareness of this
[8115.32 → 8120.60] because up here I don't see it really that consistently applied to things I don't see it marketed that hard
[8123.40 → 8129.64] yeah i I don't see it marketed literally at all up here I think on appliances yeah but I don't remember
[8129.64 → 8133.32] a time you would have bought appliances because you bought your place new, and it was full of appliances
[8134.20 → 8141.32] I bought a dishwasher because it didn't work did you look at the energy star not even a little bit
[8141.32 → 8146.52] okay I talked to my dad and I talked to some of my dad's appliance friends about which one would break
[8146.52 → 8153.32] the least fair enough uh no problems ever since okay well good chat
[8153.32 → 8161.96] uh apple is attempting to scare users if apps use external purchases uh sources the verge here
[8161.96 → 8166.28] allegedly apple seems to be trying scare tactics to prevent people from downloading using
[8166.28 → 8171.64] apps that use external payments the message which appears with a big red exclamation mark at the very
[8171.64 → 8176.20] top of the apps page says the following this app does not support the app store's private and secure
[8176.20 → 8182.92] payment system it uses external purchases scary this seems to be in response to the EU's decision in
[8182.92 → 8187.24] march 2024 where they require apple to allow developers to enable external purchase options
[8187.80 → 8193.88] um instead of essentially forcing developers to pay a 30 fee to apple people have been reporting that
[8193.88 → 8197.88] this isn't new and apple has been doing it since the EU started enforcing apple to comply with the
[8197.88 → 8202.60] ruling change but what they've been changing is that the warning image used to just be a lowercase i
[8202.60 → 8208.44] for information rather than the new red exclamation mark uh okay because I was going to say we've talked
[8208.44 → 8213.08] about this before 100 but that makes there was also this didn't make it into the doc this week but
[8213.08 → 8218.44] there was also uh like Fortnite is not on the app store because Kim Sweeney is pushing the envelope
[8218.44 → 8224.28] again but also apple i in my humble opinion is clearly in the wrong here in the first place
[8224.28 → 8229.08] um so yeah good luck epic and apple I hope you guys bury the hatchet someday
[8230.76 → 8236.20] not yet though steam didn't get hacked speaking of hacking hatchets or something valve has responded to
[8236.20 → 8239.80] rumours of a data breach that appears to have started on LinkedIn and included claims that
[8239.80 → 8244.28] more than 89 million records were for sale with a sample of the data made available to prospective
[8244.28 → 8249.40] purchasers uh something something something valve examined a leak sample and determined the data did
[8249.40 → 8257.00] not come from a breach of steam's systems um there's a bunch of other stuff but basically from a steam
[8257.00 → 8261.56] perspective valve says customers do not need to change their passwords or phone numbers as a result of
[8261.56 → 8266.44] this event it is not a bad idea to do it anyway though it's a good reminder to treat any account
[8266.44 → 8271.56] security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious though and reminds users
[8271.56 → 8276.68] to set up steam mobile authenticator if they haven't already all right nice pretty much good guy valve
[8277.88 → 8285.40] and Nextcloud accuses google of deliberately crippling its app European software vendor Nextcloud has accused
[8285.40 → 8292.28] google of deliberately crippling its android files app a file synchronization tool in 2024 google's play
[8292.28 → 8299.32] store revoked the all files access permission that they've had since 2016 effectively crippling the app
[8299.32 → 8306.04] and instructing Nextcloud to use a more privacy aware replacement but Nextcloud says hey we can't use
[8306.04 → 8312.92] those storage access framework SAF cannot be used as it is for sharing exposing our files to other apps
[8312.92 → 8318.12] media store API cannot be used as it does not allow access to other files but only media files
[8318.76 → 8323.80] google's developer documentation states if you target android 11 and declare all files access
[8323.80 → 8327.48] it can affect your ability to publish and update your app on Google play
[8330.76 → 8334.76] so basically you can't compete with Google Drive is that what I'm hearing yikes
[8334.76 → 8344.92] yeah Timmy says there are so many file managers out there that don't have their permissions crippled uh
[8344.92 → 8349.64] yeah it does make it feel a little personal doesn't it I can't say for sure that it is
[8350.36 → 8351.88] but Nextcloud sure seems to think so
[8351.88 → 8361.16] yeah google and apple are both uh getting really stubby about defending their mobile moats right now
[8361.72 → 8366.60] yeah and I hope this continues to go poorly for them me too
[8368.60 → 8373.00] a unique username says Nextcloud is the largest competitor to all the cloud lock-in solutions from
[8373.00 → 8379.88] google and apple well yeah I don't I this doesn't feel accidental to me is what I'll say
[8379.88 → 8385.24] uh all right Dan are we supposed to be doing after dark now I think we got our announcements done
[8385.24 → 8391.40] I think we've done all the topics let's do it wow not a ton of curated merch messages today no lots
[8391.40 → 8397.72] of people buying um what are they called the tall sizes well yeah that makes sense I wonder why
[8400.20 → 8405.80] because they're great to go us it's because they're compensating its true it's true
[8405.80 → 8417.24] what for what not being short yeah we don't get to be fabric all the canines are short
[8417.24 → 8422.84] nobody just get to be surfs it's harder for us to pack because our clothing takes up more space Jamie
[8422.84 → 8430.76] calls me slender man and asks if he needs help finding my pages 10 out of 10 banter
[8432.76 → 8440.04] um all right again sure uh LLD could you expand on the hesitancy to include more tall skews I can't
[8440.04 → 8445.32] speak for others, but it's worth a five to ten dollar premium for me shouldn't that cover the overhead
[8445.32 → 8456.12] gift cards for pink 2xl tall shirts win uh the hesitancy is that in order to stock a thing you
[8456.12 → 8464.44] have to buy thousands in many cases tens of thousands of dollars worth of that thing so it is both a risk
[8464.44 → 8469.48] management issue because you don't want to go and buy tens of thousands of dollars worth of a thing that
[8469.48 → 8476.12] than just sits there um because that's bad for business and also just a cash flow management
[8476.12 → 8484.76] exercise thing you can't just take your entire existing portfolio and okay a have the know
[8485.80 → 8493.32] worker hours to create new right like new patterns for everything right like literally you are doubling
[8493.32 → 8498.68] the number of uh the amount of grading that you have to do so grading is where you take a design and you
[8499.48 → 8503.64] adjust it for all your different sizes you're you're doubling the grading that you have to do for a
[8503.64 → 8512.20] given style and then not only that, but you are significantly increasing the amount of cash outlay that
[8512.20 → 8521.56] you are spending in order to hold in order to buy and hold that inventory um it's boring spreadsheet
[8522.36 → 8528.52] accounting stuff I don't expect people to care, but it doesn't make it not
[8528.52 → 8534.84] just how it is, and it's uh it's a big part of the same reason that, or it's a big part of the reason
[8534.84 → 8542.44] that we also haven't just like started up a EU distribution warehouse because it's not that
[8542.44 → 8550.20] simple uh the logistics are not that simple the reporting and taxation and accounting and all of
[8550.20 → 8555.96] those things they're they're just not that simple and at the end of the day we are still and I can't
[8555.96 → 8564.44] emphasize this enough we are still a pretty small company right and overall we have like a hundred plus
[8564.44 → 8568.84] employees I think we're at around a hundred and something right now is that right Luke I think so i
[8568.84 → 8573.40] think that's roughly correct yeah I think that's about right, but creator warehouse doesn't have a
[8573.40 → 8579.00] hundred employees creator warehouse is a tiny company they have a couple of dozen employees
[8579.00 → 8584.12] the fact that they sell around the world at all is a small miracle right like what you're going to say
[8584.12 → 8588.36] oh yeah well they should just they should just have distribution centres on every constantly are you
[8588.36 → 8594.60] serious right now like we're we're no that's not how it works it's not how any of this works we are
[8594.60 → 8599.64] doing our best, and we are going to you know constantly try to get delivery costs down around
[8599.64 → 8605.88] the world um we're going to try to expand our styles with you know tall sizes I just got confirmation they
[8605.88 → 8613.24] promised me husky sizes for t-shirts are coming in 2026 okay we're working on it um but these things
[8613.24 → 8617.64] take time they take cash they take hours someone's got to do it
[8617.64 → 8628.36] yeah like I'm happy we're we're finally getting them and i I'm really I was very surprised uh I got
[8628.36 → 8632.20] it spoiled to me by the chat but I was really surprised that there was all the colours for tall
[8632.20 → 8637.72] sizes that's that's super cool um but I didn't really expect it I mean there's a reason why almost
[8637.72 → 8645.64] no store that you go into has any tall sizes like it's just doubling your skews like that is tough
[8645.64 → 8650.52] um and you've got to know that there's some chance that it's going to work out which is why we took
[8650.52 → 8655.16] it slows that's why we started with the black we started with a small order because in theory anything's
[8655.16 → 8660.76] a great idea yeah, but there's a big difference between people being excited about something and
[8660.76 → 8666.76] people actually pulling out their wallet and spending money on it huge difference vast ocean of
[8666.76 → 8673.16] difference so you need to be evidence driven that's a big part of what like Terran pushes ever since he
[8673.16 → 8678.68] joined it's like be data driven that doesn't mean that we can't YOLO and buy a fire truck once in a
[8678.68 → 8684.44] while, but it means that we need to overall make sure that we are making decisions that are supported
[8685.16 → 8690.92] by real world evidence that we can use as our guiding star at the very least
[8694.68 → 8700.60] hi Linus Luke and Dan question for Luke which individuals or teams do the marketing or advertising
[8700.60 → 8705.00] for float plane it would be cool to hear about the work they do to attract new creators versus users
[8705.88 → 8711.72] no we do very little work to attract new creators isn't that Linus yeah yeah that's my job
[8712.60 → 8719.16] uh I have not I have been asleep at the wheel for many years what a bad employee terrible this
[8719.16 → 8729.00] guy terrible um yeah the business team um there 's's Sean and then indirectly Colton
[8729.00 → 8735.72] on the business team who work on coming up with like the business sides of ideas of you know trying
[8735.72 → 8743.32] to make float plane uh better and more worth it for people to join and stay um for a variety of creators
[8743.32 → 8753.08] but you know the business team is focused on um leg stuff but then hopefully those features uh benefit
[8753.08 → 8758.68] other people as well or those ideas benefit other people as well but their goal they're looking at the
[8758.68 → 8764.04] LTT subscription right like they are employees at Linus media group those are business people at
[8764.04 → 8769.88] Linus me at least they're not floating and Sammy is sort of indirectly a big part of the marketing
[8769.88 → 8776.76] of float plane just by yep I just wasn't even there yet great content absolutely yeah hard big time it's
[8776.76 → 8781.48] it's Sammy making exclusives and pushing the envelope with the types of things that we're doing
[8781.48 → 8787.96] including this I guess maybe it was Linus's idea but including this um the like clips thing you're
[8787.96 → 8793.32] talking about the like short content I think that's a cool idea I shouldn't say it's my idea it's
[8793.32 → 8798.12] not like I came up with the idea of short form content, but that's not what I meant it's not like
[8798.12 → 8803.88] having that on the platform now oh I see um yeah get better at being a narcissist what's wrong with you
[8803.88 → 8811.72] sorry um but yeah so like that that's that's the engines that are going for the Linus media group side
[8811.72 → 8818.44] and you know we learn things from the content that leg does and how it performs on the platforms
[8818.44 → 8825.00] and then and then sometimes other creators ask me effectively me about that and then I'll share some
[8825.00 → 8829.16] of that information so they can benefit from that learning as well and then some of the work that
[8829.16 → 8835.96] the business team does um can can potentially benefit other creators as well, but they are
[8835.96 → 8842.44] generally focused on Linus media group expansion within the float plane universe and then the float plane
[8842.44 → 8848.12] dev team essentially tries to make float plane better for all the creators because the float plane dev team
[8848.12 → 8853.88] is focused on the platform as a whole um the full plane dev team has been very focused on
[8853.88 → 8860.44] on that that big project we've been doing for a while that has been semi-leaked but not fully leaked
[8860.44 → 8868.04] um and that has resulted in when the business team keeps coming to us with very, very reasonable
[8869.00 → 8876.60] fairly measured requests uh us going sorry can't do it right now a little bit too busy, and then we've
[8876.60 → 8882.36] been doing that for quite a while now so sorry business team but um there are things that they want
[8882.36 → 8889.40] to do that that will be good to be clear um, and we will do it eventually but yeah that's that's kind
[8889.40 → 8897.16] of that circle there 's's Sean and Golden from the business team and then Sammy from the content
[8897.16 → 8908.12] team and then the float plane dev team how about some more yeah I'm just looking up this next one um this
[8908.12 → 8912.12] has been added to drive learn more it's like no, no I want to open it in drive I have my
[8913.00 → 8920.28] I have my uh new product in new product introductions inventory planning sheet isn't driven awful and I'm
[8920.28 → 8927.64] trying to oh no oh, oh cool it is enhanced without being blurry this time uh cool okay hit me Dan
[8928.28 → 8933.40] dear Daniel lesser please could you ask the relevant authorities if we might be able to receive an
[8933.40 → 8939.96] update on the production of the pencil scribe driver yours faithfully a Brit in need of a pencil okay the last
[8939.96 → 8948.68] NPI uh document I have says current launch date April 30th 2025 what does NPI mean Linus new product
[8948.68 → 8960.12] introduction so that didn't happen good job um we don't have a history of that at this company at all
[8960.12 → 8966.44] in all seriousness sometimes in all seriousness we are way tighter about things now but what I'm trying to
[8966.44 → 8976.12] say is soon my niece people are kind of like chanting it in flow plane chat do we have anything
[8976.12 → 8981.16] we can say about mod mat we'll have updates when we can, it will be ready when it is ready
[8981.72 → 8984.44] and we'll update you when we're able to only when it is ready
[8984.44 → 8992.12] my niece is having trouble finding a pc under a thousand dollars to play Fortnite and Roblox any
[8992.12 → 8997.40] tips on how to navigate ultra low budget pc buying it's hard to know the line between performance and
[8997.40 → 9008.12] requirements do I ever have tips on that may i suggest a really great uh well okay YouTube channel a
[9008.12 → 9014.76] bit of a narcissistic host you'll have to kind of get past that whiny voice uh so check this out so
[9014.76 → 9022.44] Linus tech tips uh yeah yeah this guy right here oh he's awful anyway uh the point is you just go
[9022.44 → 9029.08] on the videos okay uh this is a man they really do like clutter up with these members only videos
[9029.80 → 9036.60] anyway the point is you kind of scroll down, and you see if there's any good ones on uh you know making
[9036.60 → 9042.28] a cheap computer okay you know what I give up on that so why don't we just use search because the
[9042.28 → 9054.60] year is 2025 minus tech tips cheap pc build here we go okay now here's a 500 gaming pc oh a 69 gaming pc
[9055.16 → 9062.28] from two months ago hey that looks pretty good uh we could try yeah I wouldn't build the lowest rated pc
[9062.28 → 9068.04] but the ultimate 500 gaming pc from four months ago that looks pretty solid oh you
[9068.04 → 9072.84] could pick a good budget gaming CPU that no one ever told you about from a month ago lots of really
[9072.84 → 9079.00] good resources here oh what about the repairing the perfect pc no I wouldn't recommend that the perfect
[9079.00 → 9089.80] pc at every price though hey there's a good one yeah heck yeah I would say of these I want to go ultimate
[9089.80 → 9095.48] 500 gaming pc and then maybe you could make a couple clever upgrades you could have a look at
[9095.48 → 9099.80] perfect pc at every price and then the uh 500 gaming pc is kind of somewhere in between there
[9102.84 → 9109.56] hey Wanda DL downsizing from three gaming pcs to just one with sunshine slash moonlight
[9109.56 → 9116.28] what are your thoughts on the current state of self-hosted game streaming super cool if we do a tech house
[9116.28 → 9124.04] which is kind of in conversation um I don't think I would run fibre optic display port and fibre USB
[9124.04 → 9131.16] everywhere I think I would just go sunshine moonlight run cat 6a everywhere and just freaking have one
[9131.16 → 9136.44] gaming pc and then like I want to try that thin clients man so cool have I talked to you about my
[9136.44 → 9143.96] issues with sunshine moonlight um no I meant to talk about this on wan show but i I think i just
[9143.96 → 9150.12] completely forgot, and it's its been a few weeks now so I'm going to try to make sure I get all this
[9150.12 → 9156.68] accurate but um I was trying to set that up at home I bought a new controller uh because Linus wouldn't
[9156.68 → 9164.68] stop harassing me well it never worked and you my stalled so many of our gaming sessions so I got a
[9164.68 → 9175.72] new controller um, and it comes with a little charging dock thingy a charging don't come with it, but it was
[9175.72 → 9182.04] like really cheap right so it has a cheap charging dock yes yeah and that has a dongle in it which is
[9182.04 → 9188.44] nice okay it's a dongle good wireless connectivity cool I don't have to have it be wired any more uh
[9188.44 → 9195.88] wow neat this is compelling you so wait you say this controller you say this controller can
[9195.88 → 9202.12] charge I can explain why that matters it can charge on a dock, and it's wireless why it matters but does it
[9202.12 → 9211.00] wirelessly charge you know maybe they'll come uh technically yeah yeah really with no wires yep
[9211.00 → 9219.64] sans wires even um where are you going with this okay my my my reason for that is I don't have the
[9219.64 → 9225.32] Bluetooth things for my computer he doesn't have the Bluetooth things I had one idea where I could buy
[9225.32 → 9234.04] the little antennas yeah yeah the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi antennas or I could buy the base the dock
[9234.04 → 9240.44] charging thing I tried to put my dock was the same price so I decided to go with that one oh what a story
[9240.44 → 9247.96] riveting tail tap able to use the controller wirelessly um I can play games with my TV which
[9247.96 → 9253.32] seems cool so I want to do that without running a super long HDMI cable so I was trying to set up um
[9253.32 → 9260.76] this setup to install which one is it I don't know one of them is it sunshine on the TV I can't remember
[9261.40 → 9265.56] to install whichever one has to go on the TV um it turned out that I needed a
[9265.56 → 9272.76] an app on the TV which is like developer mode or whatever and in order to install that app you have
[9272.76 → 9286.76] to have um an developer account oh do you have a LG TV nice yeah nice to so i i I set up an account and
[9286.76 → 9293.72] it was like acting a little bit weird when I was setting the account up so I immediately signed out
[9293.72 → 9298.12] went to go sign back in because I was like I don't trust that if I remember correctly there's only one
[9298.12 → 9302.60] password field that doesn't get you to verify your password um and there was some other stuff that was
[9302.60 → 9308.92] that was just acting oddly and it is refused my login so I'm like okay well forgot password I'll just
[9308.92 → 9314.76] reset my password and fix it um go to enter my password again you can't use the same password twice
[9314.76 → 9321.32] nice like hmm okay I've done it before where I've typed a password the same way twice and then not
[9321.32 → 9328.44] been able to figure it out, but it wasn't except I was copying and pasting oh okay so but anyway so I make a
[9328.44 → 9336.20] new one reset the password all good I'm logged in it's all cool I log out I go to log back in again
[9336.20 → 9343.88] doesn't work forgot password reset password can't use the same password bro what the heck because i
[9343.88 → 9348.84] have to make the account on my computer or my phone yeah and then I have to log in on the TV so I have
[9348.84 → 9354.20] to log in again I can't this whole like you can only log in once thing will not work for me, I have to
[9354.20 → 9359.64] log in again so I'm like okay, okay so I make a new account like maybe that account's just screwed up
[9361.00 → 9368.52] exact same problem okay, okay okay well I'm realizing I'm on the American site anyway and my TV actually
[9368.52 → 9373.48] cares, and it has to be the Canadian site so let me do that so I'll make an account on the Canadian
[9373.48 → 9379.64] site okay oh well you can't use the same email on both for some reason but sure why not so I have a
[9379.64 → 9385.08] lot of emails that's fine I'll use another email I'll make another account weird but okay I get signed
[9385.08 → 9391.96] in no problem sign out sign back in doesn't work reset password can't use the same password it's the same
[9391.96 → 9400.76] problem I can't, I can't log in I can't, I cannot log into this account no matter what i don't know
[9400.76 → 9409.08] why it won't work I email their support, and they send me a link i I detail everything I detail everything
[9409.08 → 9415.80] that I did all the different accounts the different uh regions yeah everything i I get a response back
[9415.80 → 9422.36] that is not I promise you it is not a generic auto reply it took like two days to get the response
[9422.36 → 9426.76] it's clearly someone typed it out they just linked me the forgot your password link
[9428.68 → 9429.80] nothing else
[9432.60 → 9437.08] and when I got that email I was just like all right whatever I'm just going to like come back to this in a
[9437.08 → 9441.64] couple weeks and whatever bug they probably have will hopefully be resolved is there not a
[9441.64 → 9449.56] steam link app for web OS I haven't tried um I don't think there was I think yeah I think i
[9449.56 → 9454.52] checked and I don't think there was uh funny hat says I've lost the plot what's going on now uh user
[9454.52 → 9461.48] error no i just i just I'm just fucking yeah I'm just fucking yeah uh getting password on sign
[9461.48 → 9465.24] up yeah it's it might be something like that too I don't know there's something weird I ran into a
[9465.24 → 9470.20] problem recently I want I don't want to say what organization it was but uh I think I took a picture of
[9470.20 → 9475.40] it or I took a screenshot or something well that's going to make it pretty obvious one of the well I'm
[9475.40 → 9480.36] not going to show it but I want to go look at what the actual rules were one of the probably worst
[9481.00 → 9490.20] rules for passwords eyes like ever seen um yeah so it has to have an uppercase letter it has to have
[9490.20 → 9496.20] a lowercase letter it has to have a number it has to have a symbol it has to have at least eight
[9496.20 → 9505.00] characters makes sense, but it cannot be more than 15 characters but why so it has to be between
[9505.00 → 9511.08] eight and 15 characters save all those bits in there on their storage server for the so
[9512.04 → 9518.60] there's like very a very small range of character counts that the password could even be and then
[9518.60 → 9525.48] there's like all these I don't know just way to make your thing less secure my goodness
[9525.48 → 9530.76] that's hilarious um okay well someone get Luke a password manager I have one what are you even
[9530.76 → 9539.80] talking about what does that have to do with what I'm doing whatever anyway oh Geez Dan hello Villa
[9539.80 → 9545.16] I've been curious about the silicon lottery and how some CPUs on the same batch can be better than others
[9545.16 → 9552.12] what exactly is better like how do the less good ones even work, so there's a ton of redundancy when
[9552.12 → 9561.32] you manufacture high complexity silicon products more than you would probably imagine is wasted to
[9561.32 → 9569.80] having a backup plan in case there is a small imperfection um so that's part of it is you can have one that has
[9569.80 → 9581.80] um that is that is higher quality um in certain spots so uh for instance like back when uh
[9581.80 → 9589.64] NVIDIA had those GPUs in the 465 470 days when some of the 465s could be unlocked to have additional
[9589.64 → 9597.96] functional units that means that they uh they didn't have so many defects in some of those uh some of the
[9597.96 → 9602.92] I forget if they were called SMS back then but whatever in some of those functional units um such
[9602.92 → 9610.04] that they had to be shut off so part of it is you can just have parts of the CPU that have so many
[9610.04 → 9615.96] problems with or GPU or whatever it is that have so many problems with them that they can't turn
[9615.96 → 9623.48] on that part of it um you can also have ones that have more parts of them that can be turned on versus
[9623.48 → 9628.76] ones that can have fewer parts that's why you'll get like AMD's TRI cores back in the day those were
[9628.76 → 9636.28] all quad-core CPUs but like one of the cores was in many cases dead or in many cases actually not dead
[9636.28 → 9642.76] and you could unlock them to quad-core processors okay, so then the other part is more to do with the
[9642.76 → 9650.92] overall quality of it and that's where everything might work, but it might not be within the target
[9650.92 → 9657.00] power envelope or thermal envelope for that particular part uh so they might have to you
[9657.00 → 9663.48] know turn off some cores or turn off some cash for that reason uh probably wouldn't affect cash so much
[9663.48 → 9667.96] but cores for sure you might have to turn off some cores in order to make this one fit into the
[9667.96 → 9676.04] power envelope for you know uh a core i5 you know 14th gen or whatever the case may be so basically what
[9676.04 → 9681.72] it comes down to is that it's pretty much black magic at this point how they managed to make
[9681.72 → 9688.12] anything as small as it is there are a ton of defects in them both small defects in terms of
[9688.12 → 9695.00] like oh yeah this gap is like this many like freaking angstroms larger or smaller than it's supposed to be
[9695.00 → 9700.12] and you know that could affect uh the power or performance character the switching speeds of it
[9700.12 → 9705.48] or you know whatever else you can have defects like that um you can have defects that are caused by
[9705.48 → 9713.16] contamination um so they build in a ton of redundancy, and they also use binning as they're sorting all
[9713.16 → 9720.28] of these dies to turn them into different products at different tiers uh based on what they know during
[9720.28 → 9726.12] the pre-production process and the design process is going to be their defect rate so silicon lottery
[9726.12 → 9734.04] basically just means that you know both of these chips might you know pass the minimum bar of how many
[9734.04 → 9739.08] cores need to be active and what kind of power and thermal characteristics it's supposed to have
[9739.08 → 9743.00] but one was like slightly better and that's great
[9745.32 → 9749.32] and one of them wasn't and you either get a better one or you don't and there's absolutely no way of
[9749.32 → 9755.72] knowing because intel or AMD or NVIDIA they don't want to go into things with that degree of granularity
[9755.72 → 9758.76] because then their product stack becomes an absolute cluster bomb
[9761.88 → 9768.52] and last one I've got for you today hello LLD just wondering will the cargo shorts come back
[9768.52 → 9774.68] sometime in the future I love mine just wish I had gotten more oh Alan actually has a really
[9774.68 → 9779.80] cool way of explaining the like the small defects like differences in gaps and stuff remember folks
[9779.80 → 9786.44] computers are actually analog machines that operate on digital logic so small defects can
[9786.44 → 9791.56] change the analog characteristics without affecting the binary logic up to a point if you crank up the
[9791.56 → 9797.72] analog the boolean logic breaks down so analog meaning like voltage current temperatures things that are
[9797.72 → 9807.64] inherently analog yeah that's a perfect way of explaining that uh okay cargo shorts I don't know uh hold on let me see
[9809.80 → 9821.32] oh that wouldn't be a new product introduction anyway so it wouldn't be on this document so i honestly
[9821.32 → 9832.04] have no idea I'm sorry uh maybe I think so uh if they do not this year
[9832.04 → 9843.64] yeah not this year yeah not this year and that's it we'll see you again next week guys same bad time
[9843.64 → 9848.44] same bad channel I'll see you soon I guess oh yeah bye
[9848.44 → 9856.20] bye
[9856.92 → 9858.34] hmm
[9858.34 → 9862.28] okay
[9862.28 → 9865.00] so
[9877.96 → 9878.38] you
[9878.38 → 9880.38] You
