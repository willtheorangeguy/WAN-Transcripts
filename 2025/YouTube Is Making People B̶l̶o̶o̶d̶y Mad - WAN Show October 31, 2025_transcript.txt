[0.00 --> 6.80]  welcome to the wan show everybody we got lots of topic here for you today
[6.80 --> 14.10]  luke house robots are almost here that's kind of crazy no yeah and youtube is bringing updates
[14.10 --> 22.84]  surely that'll go great right probably not also uh we've got mark andreessen funding ai powered
[22.84 --> 29.60]  astroturfing because we needed more bad things in the world i guess and nintendo may have lost
[29.60 --> 37.10]  a key patent in japan that's crazy you know what else is crazy is this intro from nokia
[59.60 --> 69.22]  the show is brought to you today by salie neuro ubiquity and server.pro and of course
[69.22 --> 74.52]  that's alongside our rap partner dbrand our chair partner secret lab and our laptop partner dell
[74.52 --> 79.80]  the laptops are hiding a little bit today they're hiding behind our spooky vision skull but that's
[79.80 --> 84.54]  okay yeah you can imagine that they're there they're powering the reliable way that we're
[84.54 --> 88.16]  going to be able to go through the wan doc with you guys and enjoy all these wonderful topics
[88.16 --> 92.86]  why don't we kick things right off with the big youtube news this week
[92.86 --> 100.44]  how do they manage to do this it's almost like they try to make the most unpopular possible
[100.44 --> 105.40]  decisions i mean we had that one thing recently where i was like oh that seems pretty cool where
[105.40 --> 111.22]  they had the ai powered likeness recognition so you could opt out of having ai slop using your
[111.22 --> 115.36]  likeness all over the platform that was cool that seemed pretty cool that seemed like objectively
[115.36 --> 120.90]  good and then they followed up with a triple whammy worth of updates and policy changes
[120.90 --> 130.42]  with an ai super resolution upscaler that's planned to be applied to all videos under 1080p
[130.42 --> 135.56]  oh was it all videos or all live streams okay i seem to remember seeing an email about live streams but
[135.56 --> 143.26]  this says videos so that's interesting as well as a crackdown on both violent video games and
[143.26 --> 150.88]  gambling content this expanded crackdown which goes into effect november 17th is paired with more
[150.88 --> 156.32]  stringent age verification will prohibit content that directs viewers to online gambling sites
[156.32 --> 161.26]  which now includes digital goods gambling like video game skins cosmetics and nfts
[161.26 --> 169.60]  oh wow and youtube will also be age restricting casino style games without real world monetary value
[169.60 --> 177.16]  big g is also adding broader criteria for violent video game content that will be age restricted such as
[177.16 --> 185.26]  scenes of torture or mass violence against non-combatants so this is a whole bunch to unpack let's start
[185.26 --> 192.58]  with the stuff that i wholeheartedly agree with youtube does not need to direct people to online gambling
[192.58 --> 197.08]  sites if anything i think the professional sports space could stand to learn a little bit from youtube here
[197.08 --> 202.50]  has youtube not been taking advertising from gambling sites see they have which is why i'm finding the
[202.50 --> 208.90]  whole thing kind of confusing so rules for thee and not for me yeah but can i just take this as a small
[208.90 --> 214.72]  i don't think so it's not really a win is it it really feels like maybe they're just trying to take all the
[214.72 --> 224.46]  pie from gambling site funding right right but from which country is it american pie is it
[224.46 --> 231.56]  i also i'm just recognizing that you don't have a halloween costume which is a halloween costume
[231.56 --> 235.50]  because other people dressed up as you so if you dressed up in a halloween costume would actually
[235.50 --> 241.38]  kind of screw the whole thing up which is like the most amazing loophole ever and i'm just i i think
[241.38 --> 244.10]  very good i went as a tech youtuber
[244.10 --> 255.26]  there you go um okay yeah and then so we've also got the bit where you're not allowed to direct
[255.26 --> 260.24]  viewers so so yeah you can't direct viewers to online gambling sites which now includes
[260.24 --> 267.98]  video game skins cosmetics and nfts i mean oh man how do we uh okay because because i do i i i
[267.98 --> 273.42]  actually do support that because it was clear that nobody else was going to do anything about it
[273.42 --> 279.38]  and so it feels it feels like for youtube to step in and go yeah no you actually can't do that
[279.38 --> 286.96]  uh i i like that i also honestly really like the idea of age restricting casino style games even if
[286.96 --> 292.40]  they don't have real world monetary value i i do think that there's a level of extreme that's not
[292.40 --> 296.34]  necessary like i don't know if you remember this but a little while back there was some controversy
[296.34 --> 302.72]  around like even pokemon blue getting banned somewhere because there was the casino has a
[302.72 --> 308.18]  casino in it um seems a little much yeah that that seems a little bit much it's not a core mechanic i
[308.18 --> 313.30]  if i remember correctly i would just skip it every single time yeah because you lose all your money
[313.30 --> 320.62]  yeah um but but like in in general i i think i i've spoken extensively enough in the past about
[320.62 --> 327.38]  my frustration with gambling mechanics being introduced to children in everywhere from video
[327.38 --> 335.74]  games to real world settings um like the collectibles yeah happy meals even arcades right like you think
[335.74 --> 340.34]  you're playing a game of skill what you're actually playing is a game of chance and you are putting in
[340.34 --> 345.28]  a whole bunch of money then at the end you get a little dopamine rush you know barrel of monkeys or
[345.28 --> 350.80]  whatever toy and you go wow i won but what you actually did was lose and like i've had to have
[350.80 --> 357.20]  that conversation with my kids where they go oh yeah the best deal in the castle fun park prize bin is
[357.20 --> 362.40]  is this or this i'm like actually the best deal is if mommy and daddy had just spent the money that we
[362.40 --> 370.94]  spent on these gambling games and just bought you a barrel of monkeys um but of course you know that
[370.94 --> 376.62]  wouldn't have been as fun we just need to recognize it for what it is paying an amount of money to have
[376.62 --> 382.76]  the amount of fun that was playing these games the prize is not a prize it's a sucker prize which
[382.76 --> 398.82]  sometimes is a sucker if you like lollies could be all right candy oh oh um anyway does anybody know
[398.82 --> 406.76]  if youtube does allow gambling ads like on the site i i don't i have youtube premiums so i i wouldn't
[406.76 --> 412.16]  really see stuff like that like can you too like do you get ads for like i i don't know what's a
[412.16 --> 417.40]  gambling thing poker stars is that still a thing i have no idea i i have no idea what's what's one of
[417.40 --> 424.64]  the sports betting i don't know what's it's oh okay yeah okay in spril says it's all gambling ads
[424.64 --> 429.76]  yeah they've seen stake ads seen draft kings okay yeah oh yeah yeah yeah draft kings that's one of
[429.76 --> 437.08]  the ones um okay cool so yeah it man this does feel a little bit rules for the and not for me but then
[437.08 --> 439.10]  again it is it is
[439.10 --> 454.42]  okay if i can try to uh i don't know devil's advocate is the right term for this
[454.42 --> 459.52]  if i can try to vouch for them a little bit which i don't necessarily think this is accurate but if i
[459.52 --> 467.34]  can um maybe they think at least that they can control the narrative around their ads more maybe
[467.34 --> 474.48]  they can target it to the the the the right people the right people being adults adults maybe they think
[474.48 --> 480.54]  that they can do that stuff a little bit better than creators just being unable to because they're
[480.54 --> 485.22]  just blasting their video out there and then you know what i'm gonna take i'm gonna take this as a
[485.22 --> 493.58]  small win still then because they could they could get even more money because they could sell tar
[493.58 --> 500.78]  like gambling content target hold on just a second they could sell gambling targeted gambling ads
[500.78 --> 506.80]  against gambling content and there would be more money in it for them if they allowed that content to
[506.80 --> 513.44]  go to the broadest possible audience versus if they restricted it in any way extremely small w i'm
[513.44 --> 521.42]  talking like i'm talking like three three point okay on an enlarged sheet of paper like on an industrial
[521.42 --> 529.82]  printer okay but there is a tiny w in there small w i don't know because i think the gambling content
[529.82 --> 535.30]  still happens because a lot of a lot of original back in the day style and i'm sure this still happens
[535.30 --> 543.54]  gambling you know creator monetization was gambling sites giving people a ton of money to gamble on
[543.54 --> 552.76]  their site um so it was like in in a lot of cases undisclosed sponsorship effectively um and then actual
[552.76 --> 558.10]  just sponsorship what they're cracking down on is linking not making that content i believe
[558.10 --> 564.86]  digital goods blah blah blah which will prohibit content that directs viewers to it i mean directs
[564.86 --> 569.90]  viewers and but they will also age restrict casino style games without real world monetary value it's
[569.90 --> 577.72]  like no i i so casino style games without real world monetary value so it could still have real world
[577.72 --> 583.88]  monetary value if it was a real casino and they're only actually restricting you from linking to it
[583.88 --> 591.06]  so to my interpretation you can still make that content you just can't link to the site that you're
[591.06 --> 591.58]  playing on
[591.58 --> 597.62]  does it say link or direct it says directs
[597.62 --> 604.60]  strengthened approach okay here i'm going to bring up the original source okay prohibits content that
[604.60 --> 608.54]  directs viewers to online gambling sites or applications that are not certified by google
[608.54 --> 612.38]  so yeah it comes down to certified by google is very different wording than what we had in the
[612.38 --> 618.42]  in the dark uh including digital goods yep yep yep yep yep social casino content
[618.42 --> 630.36]  okay okay graphic game yeah yeah it's i gotta be honest with you it's pretty it's pretty hand wavy
[630.36 --> 636.28]  um it seems like there's a lot of room for interpretation here which it's gonna have to be
[636.28 --> 642.02]  is in their defense yeah it's pretty much what you have to do when you create site guidelines i mean
[642.02 --> 649.82]  this is not a law right google is not the law um and if you make it super specific people will just
[649.82 --> 655.50]  work around it it happened to twitch and they just became a laughingstock you like have to do it vaguely
[655.50 --> 661.86]  unfortunately um so we'll see what that actually turns into the violence in video game one is
[661.86 --> 666.50]  interesting okay well that one i wanted to unpack a little bit separately sure let's move on to it
[666.50 --> 671.38]  you know what you're right yep let's talk about i saw some speculation online that this was preemptive
[671.38 --> 678.68]  uh for the gta 6 launch oh which actually yeah i had basically the same reaction of like
[678.68 --> 683.48]  interesting because you know there's going to be an insane flood of content whether i mean
[683.48 --> 687.96]  it's probably going to be good but whether the game is good or not an incredible amount of people will
[687.96 --> 692.48]  play it and there will be an incredible amount of content made about it yeah and a lot of it will
[692.48 --> 699.94]  probably include scenes of doing things to npcs that could constitute well torture or mass violence
[699.94 --> 708.40]  against non-combatants yeah honestly everything there will also be gambling um like right there
[708.40 --> 713.66]  will also be the skins there will also be like literally everything in this update will have
[713.66 --> 721.50]  something to do with gta oh that actually that actually makes a ton of sense who knows but i i saw that
[721.50 --> 727.58]  idea and it seemed super legit to me um it also could just be something that's been on the docket
[727.58 --> 733.28]  basically forever and they've been waiting for a quiet moment to just kind of make these changes
[733.28 --> 740.74]  and yeah and roll them out i uh i i was not expecting this to ever happen and i gotta tell you
[740.74 --> 748.64]  some of our content would fall under these guidelines as uh potentially being age gated which oh is sort of
[748.64 --> 755.98]  a downer because this is the next section like what what this means for you and your content content
[755.98 --> 762.28]  uploaded before november 17th 2025 that violates these guidelines may be removed or age restricted
[762.28 --> 768.68]  but will not result in a strike remember age restricted videos can stay on your channel for 18 plus
[768.68 --> 779.04]  audiences uh so i tend to content do you think would get whenever we fire up cyberpunk just as like a
[779.04 --> 781.10]  benchmark i tend to play karmageddon
[781.10 --> 790.08]  because then i don't have to aim and we can just kind of you know rip around in the city and
[790.08 --> 796.12]  and it attracts the police which gives me an opportunity to get into a firefight like it just is it's kind of
[796.12 --> 800.34]  it's not necessarily a scene of torture but it's definitely mass violence against non-combatants
[800.34 --> 805.26]  yeah it really is isn't it yeah see i always thought of them as just sort of digital pixels i didn't really
[805.26 --> 814.42]  you know think it mattered non-combatant yeah yeah um so this could affect a not totally insignificant
[814.42 --> 824.86]  number of our older videos you should you should find a like generic clip of like some like i don't know
[824.86 --> 829.46]  what's that there was some like terrible flash game back in the day where you took care of like horses
[829.46 --> 836.80]  you just like brushed horses you should get like footage of that it's like every every time you go to
[836.80 --> 839.90]  karmageddon spree it just like covers the screen with
[839.90 --> 845.24]  youtube appropriate content um
[845.24 --> 854.50]  yeah um i don't know so you can make edits uh youtube does have their their built-in video editor
[854.50 --> 860.78]  tool you can use to uh trim or blur the footage but you'd have to make any changes before november 17th
[860.78 --> 865.82]  uh so we would have to find whatever videos have this we'd have to go in and i think realistically i'm
[865.82 --> 872.26]  just gonna not bother and then anything that they flag on us we're just going to appeal and then fix in
[872.26 --> 879.00]  the meantime and then we'll hopefully sort it out that way uh there are some there there are some sort
[879.00 --> 885.44]  guidelines that they use to to determine whether it's violative of their policy so the duration
[885.44 --> 892.54]  matters if the graphic scene is sustained rather than fleeting um so for compilation videos they will
[892.54 --> 898.16]  now consider the cumulative duration of all the graphic clips combined okay um and then there's
[898.16 --> 903.76]  prominence so if the violent imagery is zoomed in or is the main focus of the scene
[903.76 --> 909.86]  and this one bones me a little if they're if it's against realistic human characters
[909.86 --> 916.12]  yeah it's a small portion of the video though yeah so maybe we'll do some credit there
[916.12 --> 918.44]  yep some social credit you know
[918.44 --> 926.46]  i was just in china so i had social credit on the mind here i found a youtube youtube acceptable game
[926.46 --> 931.28]  you just run around you collect carrots jump
[931.28 --> 944.38]  we did it yay oh wait more carrots jump i'm gonna oh no i made it i actually don't think this is
[944.38 --> 950.42]  acceptable i learned recently visiting the bunny cafe in vancouver with my daughter that carrots are
[950.42 --> 955.76]  actually too sweet for bunnies are they too sweet for horses not healthy oh
[955.76 --> 963.56]  so no what are they supposed to eat no good root vegetables they can eat leafy greens okay yep
[963.56 --> 967.96]  and probably other things but but they said carrots are too sweet not good for them
[967.96 --> 974.32]  there are bunny cafes yes there are bunny cafes this one's not one of the depressing ones where
[974.32 --> 981.04]  like the animals are abused and stuff though they they work as a like a shelter and rehoming service so
[981.04 --> 986.84]  when you go in all of the bunnies that are in there can be adopted which is pretty cool so
[986.84 --> 992.20]  yeah uh i don't i don't remember what it's called i feel like i should look it up now but it's like
[992.20 --> 997.20]  the bunny cafe in vancouver carrots seem to be good for horses oh that's nice it's called the bunny cafe
[997.20 --> 1003.26]  oh fantastic 1696 venables street there you go bunny cafe pretty chill they seem like cool people
[1003.26 --> 1010.72]  i've never been to a cat cafe because i live in one stale biscuit asked
[1010.72 --> 1019.10]  we have four cats living in our house right now uh does evan drink coffee not a cafe then neither of
[1019.10 --> 1025.82]  you drink coffee we have coffee oh just in case someone visits i mean technically you walk into a
[1025.82 --> 1032.50]  starbucks nobody's actually drinking coffee is it still a cafe i say yes well because they have coffee so
[1032.50 --> 1039.86]  they have coffee having coffee yeah sure we have coffee fair enough got him uh okay we do have
[1039.86 --> 1045.78]  some now i get to uh tell the local government about linus's illegal cafe business in his house would
[1045.78 --> 1052.36]  you like to watch the tech linked example of the ai sharpening yeah so the super resolution upscaler
[1052.36 --> 1056.66]  absolutely all right here we go can we see this yeah well i hope so
[1056.66 --> 1061.70]  that's fine i don't think we need audio it's more of a visual experience
[1061.70 --> 1068.42]  oh my god unskipable is it a visual experience linus it's a visual experience what am i even watching
[1068.42 --> 1076.18]  an ad for disneyline is my guest nope disneyland uh okay so hold on a second first things first oh is
[1076.18 --> 1080.98]  this just the same thing that we saw months ago that riley talked about months ago
[1080.98 --> 1089.06]  hmm is this months ago yeah hold on hold on that's not what i thought this was i assumed this was
[1089.06 --> 1097.62]  different opt-out ai super res all videos under 1080p as well as a crackdown uh hold on hold on okay
[1098.82 --> 1103.06]  i need to double check something to make sure that i don't say something that i can't say
[1103.06 --> 1116.10]  youtube debuts ai enhanced super resolution for low res videos blah blah blah high resolution
[1116.10 --> 1123.06]  derivatives blah blah blah blah will clearly indicate them as super resolution leaving the originals intact
[1124.42 --> 1129.14]  okay in the case of offending videos creators can opt out
[1129.14 --> 1136.90]  okay blah blah blah blah so youtube produces additional hd copies of a low res source of
[1136.90 --> 1142.34]  material gives you the option of using them in the quality menu next to the originals so no my
[1142.34 --> 1149.30]  understanding is that this is not shorts directed it may be using the same technology which is maybe why
[1150.26 --> 1158.18]  riley linked it like that but it will look like this so we may have to go source ourselves a new
[1158.18 --> 1165.38]  example of this uh maybe we could try charlie bit my finger and see if it has been if it has been ai
[1165.38 --> 1170.34]  super resolution but i went to the zoo you could try that one too that would be a that would be a great
[1171.22 --> 1178.10]  example of something that might have a thing charlie bit my finger original does not
[1178.82 --> 1184.74]  have any super resolution neither does me at the zoo all right if anyone finds one go ahead and throw it in
[1184.74 --> 1189.62]  the chat and then we can have a look at it after is it rolled out already or are they just saying
[1189.62 --> 1190.50]  they're gonna roll it out
[1193.14 --> 1196.90]  youtube debuts yeah has anyone else anyone else actually seen it
[1199.46 --> 1203.94]  is there a time frame for this i mean they definitely rolled it out on shorts
[1203.94 --> 1213.38]  there's gonna be a lot of content that is not gonna benefit too much from this like any kind of like
[1213.38 --> 1220.34]  pixel art style gaming videos um i don't think anyone's seen it i don't think it's really out much yet
[1220.34 --> 1226.02]  or if at all oh oh hold on a second uh
[1228.98 --> 1232.42]  okay this there's no way that this doesn't have it
[1233.94 --> 1244.74]  oh no no no
[1247.94 --> 1255.14]  what someone linked the the old badger badger badger song and i was like oh no way like
[1255.14 --> 1258.50]  that one has it so i went to go check it no they just linked it for fun i think
[1258.50 --> 1266.34]  it's like nice it doesn't have there's no it's just like auto 240 and 144 all right well it was worth
[1266.34 --> 1272.34]  a shot whoa whoa hold on when bingo chronified says charlie bit my finger has it for me
[1272.34 --> 1278.98]  uh okay so it's a it's a user rollout thing oh that's a bummer
[1281.14 --> 1284.98]  hold on a second they sent two links oh imgur link here we go
[1284.98 --> 1294.58]  yeah so that's what that's what it looks like for you hey interesting that the even lower ones don't
[1294.58 --> 1300.90]  have it trays and terrassant uh do we have like a like a side by side
[1300.90 --> 1312.42]  cat os says try this one of course it is because of course it is thank you for that very useful
[1313.46 --> 1320.18]  also this is already a 4k remaster so there would be no need for them to upscale it again
[1322.90 --> 1328.90]  man it's been a while it's been a while since anyone has um helpfully linked that particular
[1328.90 --> 1331.38]  absolute banger of a music video
[1334.10 --> 1341.06]  i think we can move on now it is kind of a banger isn't it it's a solidly good song oh yeah no no doubt
[1341.06 --> 1347.94]  yeah absolutely love it and wholesome too you know like yeah yeah yeah
[1349.78 --> 1355.30]  like why do songs about you know being attracted to members of the opposite sex have to be all
[1355.30 --> 1366.26]  all you know vulgar are the same sex ones not vulgar i mean not inherently why you have to
[1366.26 --> 1372.66]  no they're not no why because why do you why do you single out opposite sex well because that's what
[1372.66 --> 1378.10]  never gonna give you up is about i assume there's a there's a lady in the in the video sure yeah
[1378.10 --> 1384.02]  i just don't understand what the differentiation well no i'm just i'm just i'm contrasting with you
[1384.02 --> 1386.10]  know songs about bitches and like
[1390.90 --> 1397.62]  but what if it is a what if it is a a lesbian singing about bitches that well that's suddenly
[1397.62 --> 1405.62]  totally totally chill i i think they're allowed to do that what i'm not taking a position here
[1406.42 --> 1410.02]  i think you are well is it on the bottom or top
[1414.02 --> 1418.50]  uh okay we should we should probably move on oh
[1418.50 --> 1429.22]  what next position um yeah i mean there's a lot more discussion topics on this one actually like
[1429.22 --> 1437.46]  there's uh there's where's the line between you know do you think strict online age verification is a
[1437.46 --> 1443.46]  long-term solution is the cost and privacy worth protecting our children i mean if i thought they
[1443.46 --> 1450.18]  could do it effectively and safely and maintain privacy and and not have all this data leak no i
[1450.18 --> 1456.50]  don't think it would i i don't think i would mind it actually i i wouldn't mind age gating things um
[1457.70 --> 1464.02]  like to me it's not really any different than them checking id at the at the ticket counter of a movie
[1464.02 --> 1470.66]  yeah like i know i know but i don't trust them i know the the seedier sides of the internet have been
[1470.66 --> 1476.66]  available to us since effectively the beginning of the internet um some of the oldest parts of the
[1476.66 --> 1483.06]  internet are very not safe for work i don't think they're that old oh
[1485.94 --> 1491.38]  those jokes we've got to stop i'm gonna wear out the button it's not a joke
[1491.38 --> 1503.06]  okay uh where was i going with this um right but before it
[1505.78 --> 1511.14]  like in my experience you had to be pretty deliberate about seeking it out and now it's a lot
[1511.14 --> 1520.18]  easier now now it's just there like you almost can't be on most parts of the internet anymore without
[1520.18 --> 1533.22]  it being shoved in your face um um and it's it's it's pretty nuts so like yeah i don't know in general
[1535.38 --> 1542.42]  at least a like heavily filtered mode because you know the kids are going to get around it but if it
[1542.42 --> 1547.78]  wasn't just like passively there all the time that would probably be better and i mean our next question
[1547.78 --> 1552.98]  actually this has been very top of mind for me i just like i said i just got back from china and um
[1554.42 --> 1561.54]  they have a very different approach to the tobacco industry than we do here in canada so i was i was
[1561.54 --> 1566.42]  chatting with charade from the business team about it a fair bit because apparently a pretty popular
[1566.42 --> 1572.74]  thing to do when you go to china is to load up on your your allowance of flavored cigarettes and bring
[1572.74 --> 1579.94]  them back because they've been banned here for i don't think they lasted very long like i have no
[1579.94 --> 1585.62]  idea yeah flavored cigarettes i think were a thing here for a little while but but they they basically
[1585.62 --> 1592.26]  went away because it was determined that they were much more appealing to kids sure i mean adults like
[1592.26 --> 1596.58]  flavored things too but it was it was more of the concern about you know thinking of the children right
[1596.58 --> 1605.78]  adult flavored things and um they had they had like all kinds of cigarette innovations like i'm a
[1605.78 --> 1611.94]  non-smoker so to me it's like oh yeah interesting like i'm not going to smoke them but i'm like oh that's
[1612.90 --> 1618.50]  pretty clever if you wanted people to smoke more like there was one that they had that had so i learned
[1618.50 --> 1624.82]  how flavored cigarettes work didn't know that before so they have a little gel in them okay like i assumed that
[1624.82 --> 1630.82]  the the tobacco itself would be infused with sure some kind of i probably would have assumed the same
[1630.82 --> 1635.46]  flavor so that when you burn it it like something like a candle i don't know sure like the the fuel
[1635.46 --> 1640.42]  of the fire would have been somehow soaked in it or something i don't know but no apparently that's not
[1640.42 --> 1645.14]  how it works you just have like normal tobacco and then you have like a gel bead that you like squish
[1645.94 --> 1651.30]  and then as you're inhaling bringing it through the filter or whatever yeah then it sure so they had this
[1651.30 --> 1658.66]  one that seemed to have like multiple gel gels in it so that you could create different combinations of
[1658.66 --> 1667.54]  flavors and i'm just like freaking what like i mean cool idea i guess it like i said if you're trying
[1667.54 --> 1677.38]  to get people to smoke more um and they they had like this uh like charade was collecting like cool
[1677.38 --> 1683.70]  packages so there was this flying horse one that's from some meme like if smoking so bad why is the
[1683.70 --> 1688.10]  horse so happy or something like that i don't know there was some he was explaining it to me he's
[1688.10 --> 1695.70]  he's very into the memes let's put it that way and um and so he like got this pack of like blue
[1695.70 --> 1700.34]  flying horse are you looking it up i don't really want to share it on screen but i am trying to look it up
[1700.34 --> 1705.86]  yeah yeah the top left top left right there no it's fine we can just show the people they're adults
[1708.10 --> 1715.38]  if cigarette bad why horse happy checkmate liberals so he was so we went on a mission to find these
[1715.38 --> 1721.22]  cigarettes with the flying horse on them yeah um and it made me sort of it really just
[1722.74 --> 1729.22]  made it impossible for me to not notice the contrast between their approach which is seems to be pretty
[1729.22 --> 1737.06]  much have at it versus here in canada um charade was telling me that they're not even allowed to
[1737.06 --> 1743.54]  like brand them anymore like never mind getting rid of joe camel like they're allowed to to say what the
[1743.54 --> 1748.50]  brand is but they're not allowed to have flying horses on them they're not allowed to have pretty
[1748.50 --> 1754.18]  elegant looking ladies smoking on them or you know anything like that yeah um and and they have just like
[1754.18 --> 1762.98]  the you know gross out nastiest pictures on them because um you know we have socialized health care
[1762.98 --> 1771.86]  so you know we literally all pay for people's vices collectively which incentivize the government very
[1771.86 --> 1777.54]  strongly to advise people that hey they probably shouldn't do things that are extremely harmful and
[1777.54 --> 1783.22]  extremely expensive to treat i've always been really fascinated how the smoke break became a thing at
[1783.22 --> 1790.50]  workplaces no comment maybe not a topic we want to dive into but that has always been like genuinely
[1790.50 --> 1798.02]  fascinating to me that that became a thing yeah no it's it's mandated so like our our how our workplace
[1798.02 --> 1804.74]  employment code or whatever you have to have like there's certain like mandated break allowances and uh
[1805.30 --> 1812.98]  i think it's been revised since then but my understanding was at some point the cigarette break
[1812.98 --> 1818.34]  was specifically for cigarettes and if you were a non-smoker you just didn't get it yeah uh but i
[1818.34 --> 1824.98]  believe when i worked at the bread factory that was the rule yeah i i believe everybody gets the the
[1824.98 --> 1830.58]  15 minute breaks or whatever they are now don't don't quote me on that i don't work in the hr department
[1830.58 --> 1837.78]  um so if anyone from lmg is watching talk to hr before you start randomly taking uh smoking breaks in years the
[1837.78 --> 1847.46]  15 minute breaks last time i heard uh were like approval basis um and yeah i know way back in the
[1847.46 --> 1851.62]  day it's very likely changed by now but when i used to work at the bread factory i remember complaining
[1851.62 --> 1857.30]  to management because i couldn't take 15 minute breaks because i didn't smoke and i was like this seems
[1858.18 --> 1863.78]  very backwards i don't even necessarily like care about taking the break i'm that's fine but like the
[1863.78 --> 1871.78]  fact that there is a benefit if you are a smoker is crazy to me um so anyway arc the question that
[1871.78 --> 1877.22]  sort of prompted me to talk about just noticing this difference was should vices like vapes cannabis
[1877.22 --> 1884.58]  alcohol gambling etc should they be allowed to advertise at all i mean i'll say this much i liked watching
[1884.58 --> 1892.82]  sports more before every flipping stupid ad was just and the commentators talking about it sometimes
[1892.82 --> 1899.46]  and stuff i i agree but at the same time more people watch sports now and are maybe more engaged
[1899.46 --> 1907.38]  so if you're the company if you're the nfl you might want or quite quite famously the nba has talked about
[1907.38 --> 1913.06]  it extensively that the viewers are more engaged and they spend more and so but then if you're going to
[1913.06 --> 1917.38]  make an ends justify the means argument shouldn't the ends be something other than more money
[1917.38 --> 1926.10]  like should there be a more positive like societally positive end if you're gonna ends justify the means
[1926.10 --> 1932.74]  me on this the company will never take that route um they're multi-billion dollar whatever
[1934.26 --> 1938.58]  mba is all over the place company they're uh yeah but our question is should they be allowed
[1938.58 --> 1943.94]  yeah so we're talking on a government stance yeah um yeah i don't know like it's weird because you get
[1943.94 --> 1948.82]  into like free speech stuff and whatnot sure yeah and just like freedom of you know being a being an
[1948.82 --> 1954.58]  adult with you know agency i mean i think that's that's something that you know i've thought about
[1954.58 --> 1959.46]  a lot ever since my sister's passing right like is at the end of the day i don't like the decision that
[1959.46 --> 1965.14]  she made but if somebody chooses to harm their body whether it's harming it just a little bit
[1965.14 --> 1973.14]  or whether it's harming it an awful lot like but then there's like what can you do where is the
[1973.14 --> 1978.10]  argument end right because like do you ban snowboarding yeah exactly that's a great point
[1978.74 --> 1982.74]  do you ban almost every sport it's a great it's a great point because
[1986.42 --> 1994.26]  i mean you can even you could even make and i'd say it's a pretty bad faith argument but there would be
[1994.26 --> 2001.70]  some logical basis to it like you could make an argument that sports done excessively can be
[2001.70 --> 2008.74]  extremely harmful that sports done excessively can cause a similar sort of chemical release in your
[2008.74 --> 2014.34]  body that makes you want to do more and more and more of it and that you can become obsessive i mean
[2014.34 --> 2018.26]  anything in unhealthy quantities there are some people like that is really bad for you people that
[2018.26 --> 2025.46]  get addicted to working out yeah that can that can show up in bad ways um 100 yeah yeah but what
[2025.46 --> 2031.86]  are you supposed to do ben advertising doing sports should gyms not be able to advertise if we're talking
[2031.86 --> 2040.26]  about the the weight on the medical system as well yeah like my family knew how to effectively sneak
[2040.26 --> 2046.26]  into the emergency wing of the local hospital because we were in there so often that it was just like
[2046.26 --> 2049.70]  annoying to have to talk to the people and be like yeah we know someone in here we should be able to
[2049.70 --> 2059.14]  visit them um because we did every single sport possibly imaginable so like little problems here and
[2059.14 --> 2060.10]  there were pretty normal
[2064.58 --> 2070.34]  just get one of those stamp card things yeah certain amount of visits oh another another leg there bud
[2070.34 --> 2078.90]  yeah so i don't know but then you know the flip side of it is so again so you know where should be the
[2078.90 --> 2087.22]  line then should should should i have to flip on youtube and see a commercial for fentanyl right
[2088.26 --> 2096.82]  for for fent pills i've i have generally enjoyed that the i like that it's strange watching tv in the states
[2096.82 --> 2103.70]  because we don't have the amount of like lawyer and pharmaceutical ads that they have down there
[2103.70 --> 2112.02]  i like that we don't have those um i watch their tv and go wow i'm happy i don't have these ads not
[2112.02 --> 2115.86]  that i exactly watch tv up here either but um you know what i mean
[2115.86 --> 2127.70]  more house hippo less xanax from dan i agree yeah the house hippo was based birdian says i've never
[2127.70 --> 2134.42]  seen an ad for fent pills uh no i know it's a hypothetical exaggeration yeah no we're not well
[2134.42 --> 2142.58]  it's it's it's just it's it's demonstrating that at some point i like i think fundamentally when you
[2142.58 --> 2148.66]  really get into it even the most anti-regulation person eventually goes oh well we should probably
[2148.66 --> 2154.74]  regulate that something yeah yeah it's just that where where you end up in a very difficult conversation
[2154.74 --> 2159.78]  sometimes where's the line is that everyone has the line at a different point like i think
[2159.78 --> 2168.74]  the vast majority of people should would probably agree that you know uh that like methamphetamine
[2168.74 --> 2174.26]  probably shouldn't be just you know advertised during a sports ball game you know you shouldn't
[2174.26 --> 2181.14]  have athletes wearing like you know meth4u.com emblems on their helmets i'm able to keep playing
[2181.14 --> 2189.38]  through the pain because right like we could probably all agree that that's not good we probably shouldn't
[2189.38 --> 2196.42]  do that but then you know you end up over over on the flip side where it's just i just thought of it
[2196.42 --> 2204.18]  totally yeah i don't even want to see it uh should i see it i who cares germans like long hikes
[2204.18 --> 2210.10]  do you want to keep going on long hikes that's a reference uh
[2214.42 --> 2217.30]  do you want to be able to keep hiking through the night um
[2217.30 --> 2222.58]  okay so anyway um
[2226.74 --> 2230.50]  yeah uh wow so maybe what we could do is a new topic
[2231.54 --> 2237.06]  why don't we do that luke you want to pick one uh nintendo may have lost a key
[2237.06 --> 2244.82]  pokemon
[2244.82 --> 2245.46]  uh
[2245.46 --> 2248.66]  nintendo may have lost yeah it's not funny when you are the next poland
[2249.54 --> 2255.70]  ah yes uh nintendo may have lost a key pokemon capture patent filing in japan
[2256.66 --> 2262.50]  we have a bunch of different sources for this uh games for a creative block pc gamer games fray
[2262.50 --> 2270.02]  reported the jpo or the japan patent office has issued an office action uh an initial decision
[2270.02 --> 2276.50]  against a nintendo patent filing related to its action against pal world developer pocket pair
[2277.46 --> 2283.78]  that's funny of course their company name is even similar um following a third-party submission
[2283.78 --> 2293.14]  of prior art nintendo's filing 2024-031879 is part of a chain of patents related to the capture mechanic
[2293.46 --> 2301.14]  uh the capture mechanic described as a player character throwing a ball at a character in virtual
[2301.14 --> 2306.74]  space capturing the character and setting it in the player character's possession okay so throwing a
[2306.74 --> 2313.62]  pokeball basically basically yeah pc gamer described the subject of this particular patent as combining
[2313.62 --> 2319.54]  third-person aiming with two modes to throw items that either affect the target character like
[2319.54 --> 2324.98]  stunning it or capturing it or initiate combat against the target character by releasing a creature
[2324.98 --> 2330.90]  to battle it which happens in the newer pokemon games so pokemon battle yeah cool the rejected patent
[2330.90 --> 2336.82]  isn't directly related to the case but is both the child and parent of patents that are
[2336.82 --> 2345.22]  reference prior art games include ark monster hunter 4 pocket pairs craftopia and pokemon go
[2347.62 --> 2355.70]  okay uh the the jpo said nintendo's process lacked an inventive step onlookers have complained about the
[2355.70 --> 2362.90]  stagnant pokemon series since this lawsuit began and just to be very clear for many many many years before
[2362.90 --> 2370.10]  i mean basically since trying to think the first one no n64 had that like coliseum battler
[2370.66 --> 2374.90]  yeah so that was my stadium yeah that was a little difference thank you but that's but that's not a
[2374.90 --> 2379.46]  mainline game i i'm just i'm just saying like you know neither would have um
[2381.86 --> 2386.10]  neither would have pal world like that wouldn't have necessarily been a mainline game so i'm just that's
[2386.10 --> 2391.78]  fair i'm just trying to say like they're that is for for sure fair um you know they they did the the
[2391.78 --> 2399.46]  online version of the card game yeah i'm i'm trying to throw them i'm trying no i'm no yeah you're
[2399.46 --> 2402.98]  right i'm trying to throw them a bone that's because like the mainline games you you always hear the
[2402.98 --> 2407.54]  same thing like every time i talk to someone about pokemon games like glenn for instance we were just on
[2407.54 --> 2413.86]  that trip to japan together oh i was also in japan um we were on that trip to japan together and he was
[2413.86 --> 2417.54]  playing whatever the latest pokemon was and i was like oh yeah i haven't played one since blue and
[2417.54 --> 2422.98]  he's like sitting there playing a pokemon game like yeah you haven't missed much um yep and that seems
[2422.98 --> 2427.46]  to be the general consensus but i'm just i'm trying to throw a bone trying to throw a bone no so you're
[2427.46 --> 2432.10]  you're right i i don't know if the online version of the card game counts i don't know if it counts
[2432.10 --> 2438.66]  either but there are a lot of others pokemon snap no there was the detective pikachu uh movie that was
[2438.66 --> 2445.38]  something wasn't a game yeah it was good ryan reynolds you love to see it can movie patents
[2445.38 --> 2450.18]  apply to no no i don't mean from like a patenting standpoint i just mean like you know they haven't
[2450.18 --> 2454.74]  they haven't because it sounded like you were about to get into just like stagnant pokemon series
[2454.74 --> 2461.30]  in general just how utterly stagnant it's been well it is yeah it for sure has been yeah ryan reynolds
[2461.30 --> 2469.78]  canadian treasury uh he's been doing mean things for a bit has he hasn't he no i thought him and his
[2469.78 --> 2476.18]  wife were going after some dude and crazy legal fight and something something something am i thinking
[2476.18 --> 2482.42]  of the wrong guy i mean i know that blake lively has been involved in a lawsuit
[2482.42 --> 2492.98]  uh okay i don't know i don't care dude there's so many not okay not only is there just so many
[2492.98 --> 2498.98]  controversies every day that it's just exhausting to even consider keeping up with um but that's one
[2498.98 --> 2505.06]  that's like not even in our realm that's movie stuff so like i don't know i've only heard of this
[2505.06 --> 2512.34]  one because someone that i know was talking about it and i even then it was a lot to care enough
[2512.34 --> 2523.94]  to pay attention yeah anyways um earlier this year nintendo sought to modify another patent related
[2523.94 --> 2530.90]  to creature riding uh mid litigation suggesting difficulty in proceedings games phrase said uh
[2531.46 --> 2538.34]  litigants litigants whatever uh don't change a patent in the middle of an infringement case unless
[2538.34 --> 2544.50]  they feel the patent is at a fairly high risk of being deemed invalid in its original form which
[2546.34 --> 2551.38]  does kind of make sense discussion question is if nintendo ultimately loses this lawsuit
[2551.38 --> 2558.02]  how does that bode for its litigious attitude will it encourage more fighting back a significant
[2558.02 --> 2566.58]  amount maybe oh my i don't think nintendo will start backing down it might be that if they lose this
[2566.58 --> 2572.66]  other companies see them as less scary therefore we'll fight more but i don't i don't feel like
[2572.66 --> 2577.46]  this will slow nintendo down at all if anything they're just going to try to be more buttoned up
[2577.46 --> 2585.30]  about things so that they are less counterable that's all i would expect would happen in summary
[2585.30 --> 2594.74]  blake lively accuses director justin baldoni of toxicity on set justin baldoni counter accuses blake
[2594.74 --> 2602.98]  lively of being toxic on set cool ryan reynolds is in blake lively's corner because she is his wife
[2603.78 --> 2610.58]  and uh they have both taken reputational hits over this whole drama you're welcome
[2612.10 --> 2619.46]  that is celeb linked my life is worse for having known that is it really yes worse not very measurably
[2619.46 --> 2626.42]  okay but it is i was gonna say i i well okay no i i gotta push back on that because by the time we
[2626.42 --> 2632.90]  talk again next week on wanshow you will not know it anymore but there's some other potentially better
[2632.90 --> 2637.78]  information that could have been put in my head that i would have also forgot by next by next week
[2637.78 --> 2642.66]  dude people ask me like hours after wanshow about something i said on wanshow and i'll be like did i
[2642.66 --> 2653.46]  okay i don't i don't know yeah yeah oh man i was so ready i'm so ready for this one he sensed it
[2654.10 --> 2659.78]  all right what else i sensed is that it's time for us to talk about merch messages if you're not familiar
[2660.66 --> 2669.38]  you must be new here welcome merch messages are our way of having you guys interact with the show
[2669.38 --> 2676.18]  rather than having you donate to people who frankly probably statistically speaking don't need it as
[2676.18 --> 2682.82]  much as you do or just throw money at your screen in hopes that something good might happen uh if you
[2682.82 --> 2688.42]  want to interact with the show hey why don't you send a merch message all you gotta do is uh go to
[2688.42 --> 2696.18]  lttstore.com and add something to your cart once you add it to your cart you will be prompted to leave
[2696.18 --> 2706.98]  a merch message uh it will go to producer dan uh producer anon excuse me don't dox me um who will
[2706.98 --> 2713.38]  redirect it to wherever it needs to go or will reply to it himself or we'll just throw it up on screen
[2713.38 --> 2720.82]  with a little hi mom or whatever or he might if you are really lucky curate it and luke and i will
[2720.82 --> 2727.62]  respond to your merch message um that box is only there when we're live by the way uh before you
[2727.62 --> 2732.82]  guys go and send a merch message for today why don't we have a look at some of the things that are on the
[2732.82 --> 2740.26]  store that's right keeping with our halloween spooky theme we are bringing some of our most iconic shirt
[2740.26 --> 2750.34]  designs back from the dead do you need to do like a full refresh or something do you oh lmg.gg
[2750.34 --> 2759.78]  slash greatest hits he's got it we're calling it the greatest hits collection five of our best
[2759.78 --> 2764.90]  selling t-shirts from the last few years reimagined in both uh oh
[2767.22 --> 2775.06]  oh arty to update this text to let us know when it's good to go see the giant text in fairness to me
[2775.86 --> 2782.74]  it wasn't that red or yellow and it wasn't that prominently placed it wasn't that red or yellow
[2782.74 --> 2788.50]  what do you mean i am being exactly that i'm being verbally ironic oh i see to be fair it is
[2788.50 --> 2794.50]  technically an advertisement and you didn't see it yeah that is fair yeah it's fair i'll give them that
[2794.50 --> 2801.62]  okay we are going to have to do this later later um ignore that we can still do the merch message
[2801.62 --> 2809.86]  sure let's do a couple merch messages dan hit me i got one for you here hey lld as an aviation systems
[2809.86 --> 2816.42]  technician in the canadian armed forces and a helicopter pilot new you're wrong about jet fuel
[2816.42 --> 2821.86]  am i right am i right yeah yeah yeah yeah you're right you're right new autonomous helicopters kind
[2821.86 --> 2828.82]  of make me worry about the future of the industry would you ever ride in an ai helicopter and has new
[2828.82 --> 2838.98]  tech ever ruined a passion yes yeah all of them everyone i think a lot of ice block enthusiasts
[2838.98 --> 2845.30]  probably were pretty peeved about the invention of the refrigerator yeah yeah people who like
[2845.30 --> 2851.06]  we used to have to work for our cold fruit but he said a passion do you think there was ice block
[2852.02 --> 2858.26]  no yeah well you know what some people get pretty passionate maybe it could be their business some
[2858.26 --> 2863.38]  guy that just feels like he really had a good technique yeah really good at cutting them out like this was
[2863.38 --> 2868.34]  his thing okay i think a better example might be horses in the automobile then because people were
[2868.34 --> 2875.06]  very passionate about their horses which i totally get horses tech shops are incredible oh dude yeah
[2875.06 --> 2880.34]  that's see that's that's a career and a passion a lot of people get into running a mom and pop tech shop
[2880.34 --> 2890.26]  because they you know want to fix people's computers i had when i was like 14 that seemed like a very
[2890.26 --> 2896.58]  possible vision for my future uh yep not so much yeah no pretty pretty pretty tough pretty tough
[2896.58 --> 2904.18]  business yeah um what was uh what was i gonna say i was gonna say something what topic were we on
[2904.18 --> 2908.58]  again oh yeah that's right it was a merch message i was gonna i was gonna get somewhere with this
[2908.58 --> 2912.50]  hold on where'd it go uh yeah would you ever ride an ai helicopter
[2912.50 --> 2923.62]  it seems to me that in terms of like handling the inputs and outputs so by inputs i would mean
[2924.74 --> 2930.50]  things like uh you know wind direction and and things like readings off of an altimeter
[2931.06 --> 2939.46]  um i i i don't even i don't even know if you need ai to to make a helicopter somewhat autonomous
[2939.46 --> 2946.18]  necessarily like you could do it algorithmically without necessarily ai i mean a lot of the ai in
[2946.18 --> 2953.30]  an autonomous car for instance is more about the recognition of the route and obstacles um i mean
[2953.30 --> 2960.42]  you'd certainly need ai for any kind of like vision component of it so for like landing or obstacle
[2960.42 --> 2967.30]  avoidance or whatever else i would i ride in an ai helicopter good lord
[2967.30 --> 2975.22]  yeah knowing how sketchy helicopters are in the first place yeah like have you been in one i forget
[2975.22 --> 2980.18]  yeah yeah like a few times were you sketched no really i was a little sketched
[2981.62 --> 2986.90]  like the pilot was pilot was great and totally i trusted the pilot is my brother-in-law so certainly
[2986.90 --> 2994.18]  no interest in seeing me plummet to the ground with him in the helicopter um unless unless what i don't
[2994.18 --> 3004.42]  know yeah no should be fine all right yeah yeah um stop alec um so so that was fine i understand the
[3004.42 --> 3011.14]  whole the jesus nut thing yeah and the whole thing it just felt like it felt like crap you know like it
[3011.14 --> 3017.70]  felt really cheap yeah it's like yeah this is like a you know multi however many thousands and thousands
[3017.70 --> 3024.34]  of dollars machine and it feels cheaper than like my parents geometro when i was a kid like it
[3025.30 --> 3033.62]  like it's a light box strapped to yeah insane death spinny things yeah right like yeah but that's kind of sick
[3033.62 --> 3040.82]  carrying around a bunch of fuel you know yeah pretty terrifying i um but you know if you're talking like
[3040.82 --> 3046.66]  worrying about the future of the industry from like uh like a piloting stance like are we gonna are we gonna lose the skill
[3046.66 --> 3055.06]  skill to to pilot aircraft because we're just gonna like rely on them just operating autonomously
[3055.06 --> 3059.38]  i mean yeah that's happened for lots of things yeah i i no i yeah i think that's uh i think that's a
[3059.38 --> 3065.62]  very real concern i i don't see them going away forever just like people still ride horses and are still
[3065.62 --> 3072.66]  very enthusiastic about riding horses i think people will still fly aircraft um but will it be a
[3072.66 --> 3080.02]  disruptor in the industry yeah i i wouldn't doubt it yeah um this does seem like a perfect segue into
[3080.02 --> 3089.94]  something that we uh we're not right about last week so we got some clarifications on uh jet a fuel
[3089.94 --> 3096.98]  apparently i mean we kind of talked about this last week it's very similar to uh kerosene and um
[3096.98 --> 3102.58]  um what what else is it similar to i think the biggest thing that i read that we didn't figure
[3102.58 --> 3109.30]  out before the end of the show is that the the gas turbines were like a thing actually a super a
[3109.30 --> 3115.46]  thing and like pretty efficient yeah so this was posted by uh low boom from the ecc squad i think
[3115.46 --> 3119.78]  um but it's not as crazy as it seems on the face they're doing a lot more than just strapping a jet
[3119.78 --> 3126.42]  engine to a stand yeah this is the turbojet core of the turbofan engine so there's no fan and they're
[3126.42 --> 3133.54]  not running it on jet a so you can actually modify it to run on natural gas and hydrogen so no not as
[3133.54 --> 3139.54]  efficient as a purpose designed natural gas turbine like a power station would use but still quite quite
[3139.54 --> 3146.02]  efficient yeah quite efficient quite cheap to operate um and apparently there's a lot of these
[3146.02 --> 3152.82]  things just like kicking around because they've been retired from aviation use uh so this was
[3152.82 --> 3158.18]  something that nana exists ads ads they've been retired from aviation use uh so i don't know you
[3158.18 --> 3163.94]  might as well do something with them gives them a productive use yep so it does still it does still
[3163.94 --> 3173.14]  seem a little ridiculous to me where we get the majority of our energy from falling water um to be just like
[3176.02 --> 3183.78]  you know spitting spinning it did you hear about the uh the bc hydro ban on crypto yeah i did crazy
[3185.30 --> 3191.14]  to be clear it was only making permanent what was already a moratorium from a couple of years ago
[3191.70 --> 3198.10]  but i didn't actually know that yeah crypto mining is uh is effectively banned at least i think new
[3198.10 --> 3205.06]  startup operations are banned in the province now in order to conserve our energy capacity so it's not
[3205.06 --> 3210.10]  closing down current business i don't think so don't quote me on that though i would also be
[3210.10 --> 3217.30]  very surprised if any current business were able to expand significantly and it doesn't stop any
[3217.30 --> 3221.86]  crypto mining in the province i don't think it does anything about that one where they bought their own
[3221.86 --> 3227.94]  hydro dam or whatever it was so it would only be sense it's just yeah you can't get it from bc hydro
[3227.94 --> 3235.94]  directly if you're on the grid so cool i mean honestly it seems like something that more places
[3237.22 --> 3242.10]  might have done earlier than they did like china banned it ages ago if i recall correctly
[3242.98 --> 3248.50]  i don't know i could see like because uh basically everywhere at least a little bit of power is
[3248.50 --> 3253.94]  subsidized it would be kind of interesting to do like okay maybe you don't have to buy your own dam
[3253.94 --> 3261.94]  or your own power plant of whatever sort but you could get flagged as like non-subsidized power
[3262.74 --> 3267.94]  uh birdie num num says seems like a cop-out for not increasing infrastructure this is why i'm saying
[3267.94 --> 3274.18]  what i'm saying because if you get non-subsidized power then you're just contributing to potentially
[3274.18 --> 3279.94]  building more infrastructure potentially potentially so that seems fine to me but that's a little bit
[3279.94 --> 3286.18]  difficult to police maybe and and also i mean part of the rationale was that they want the power going
[3286.18 --> 3293.30]  to um they want the power going to projects that generate economic prosperity for the province of
[3293.30 --> 3299.62]  british columbia and doom scrolling so at real mining was one of the ones that they specifically brought
[3299.62 --> 3306.90]  up not crypto mining um so it's not that we don't have power it's that we don't want to use it for
[3306.90 --> 3312.98]  mining bitcoins that realistically all of the economic value of which are going to go out
[3313.62 --> 3321.46]  uh rather than contributing to new projects and building our economy so i get it i i i get it
[3321.46 --> 3328.58]  actually i'm i i i don't really see a problem with it personally uh what else do we want to talk
[3328.58 --> 3335.54]  about we got man we got a lot this week we do have a lot this week uh we're on two more topics
[3335.54 --> 3340.66]  should we do another one of the big main ones yeah do you want to talk about ai powered astroturfing
[3340.66 --> 3348.58]  oh yeah that one sure let's do it all right double speed ai a startup bulk content creation service
[3349.22 --> 3355.30]  uh by the way headache warning by the time i'm finished talking you will have at least the beginnings of a
[3355.30 --> 3363.22]  migraine so stay tuned double speed ai a startup bulk content creation service has received a million
[3363.22 --> 3372.10]  dollar investment from a16z aka andresen horowitz the venture capital firm founded by mark anderson and ben
[3372.10 --> 3381.94]  horowitz in 2009 the startup operates a phone farm that lets its customers orchestrate actions on
[3381.94 --> 3390.02]  thousands of social accounts through both bulk content creation and deployment through instrumented human action
[3390.02 --> 3398.02]  that seems to be a wordy way of saying that the company's phone bots mimic human interactions on
[3398.02 --> 3404.58]  physical devices in order to trick the increasingly ai powered content moderation that is employed by
[3404.58 --> 3411.78]  social platforms which seems like a wordy way to say that they use actual phones rather than virtualized
[3411.78 --> 3419.70]  hardware connected to cellular networks rather than connected to a data center and then they use
[3419.70 --> 3426.18]  you know a robot finger essentially to operate the phone in such a way that it is indistinguishable
[3426.18 --> 3432.90]  from a human operating the phone to get past any kind of uh spam prevention that would be put in place
[3432.90 --> 3441.22]  by the platforms which is a wordy way of saying they buy phone robot arm touch seem like human might not
[3441.22 --> 3446.82]  even really be arm it might yeah it might not the point a pokey thing that goes yeah the point is just that
[3446.82 --> 3455.06]  by by by operating the device kind of like um kind of like aim bots or or cheating mechanisms that rather
[3455.06 --> 3463.06]  than being software are hardware so where you actually you know have your mouse on an xy you know robot of
[3463.06 --> 3469.70]  some sort that moves it that would be impossible for any kind of anti-cheat to detect if you had like a
[3469.70 --> 3475.30]  separate computer monitoring the video feed and using machine vision to look for opponents for instance
[3475.30 --> 3484.50]  um so this is basically the phone bot farm spam content version of that kind of aimbot if that makes
[3484.50 --> 3496.34]  sense clients will pay between 1500 and 7500 dollars a month to use the phone farm which can even dm
[3496.34 --> 3503.22]  users based on their public comments saying things like one quick sec do you know that it's robot no oh
[3504.10 --> 3511.14]  it probably isn't you oh why do you say all that oh because basically the idea is that by using a
[3511.14 --> 3516.42]  physical device and some means of inputting as closely as how a human would do it as possible
[3516.42 --> 3521.22]  it will be impossible to track oh yeah but i don't i don't i suspect sorry i should have clarified this
[3521.22 --> 3526.82]  in the longer term they may go that far as to to physically interact with the screens for now they
[3526.82 --> 3532.58]  probably don't have to especially if they're using android so this this was shared in flowpoint chat and is
[3532.58 --> 3538.90]  my understanding of how these places usually tend to look there you go uh just a bunch of phones
[3538.90 --> 3545.70]  some that don't even have screens pretty wild and it is what it is yep just tons and tons and tons and
[3545.70 --> 3554.10]  tons of phones phones for days that's where your fake internet comes from yep dead internet theory baby
[3554.10 --> 3561.62]  yeah sorry i should have i should have clarified that it's not necessary today but what i suspect
[3561.62 --> 3567.06]  is that over time their spam prevention will get more sophisticated and they will start to
[3567.06 --> 3572.82]  they'll start to implement you know patterns of tracking your behavior where if all of your inputs
[3572.82 --> 3577.94]  are you know too precise or if you don't or if they're not inconsistent enough they might be able to
[3577.94 --> 3583.94]  detect the patterns in this kind of software managed screenless device i don't know that there might be
[3583.94 --> 3590.18]  other ways to detect it um are you a robot boxes have been effectively fake for a very long time
[3590.18 --> 3594.42]  like 10 years now yeah like they don't those don't matter at all but there there might there might be
[3594.42 --> 3600.18]  other ways like rooted into the operating system or something i don't know but in those cases you can
[3600.18 --> 3607.30]  almost certainly just get around it pretty easily to be honest i don't know so yeah clients pay between
[3607.30 --> 3614.18]  1500 and 7500 a month to use the phone farm which can even dm users based on their public comments
[3614.18 --> 3619.86]  saying things like sorry to hear you're experiencing x you should try y
[3622.26 --> 3631.22]  apparently it works double speed co-founder zuhaer lakhani okay claimed on twitter that out of 130 dms that
[3631.22 --> 3637.38]  were sent in one campaign 15 pointed to a conversion of course he is a double speed co-founder so he would
[3637.38 --> 3644.34]  say that it's really really great yeah he went on to post a vision for the future of social agents asking
[3645.22 --> 3650.26]  why doesn't simba from the lion king have an instagram account where he posts engages in comments and gets
[3650.26 --> 3657.06]  added to group chats the code because that's because because it's all fake simba's gonna convince someone to
[3657.06 --> 3662.42]  unalive themselves that's why the code running the service is also at least partially ai generated with
[3662.42 --> 3670.10]  lakhani writing cloud code is truly our third co-founder it's worth noting that pretty much all of
[3670.10 --> 3676.50]  this is already against the terms of service on multiple top social media platforms meta for instance
[3676.50 --> 3682.58]  prohibits posting sharing or engaging content at high frequencies and specifically disallows selling
[3682.58 --> 3687.70]  buying buying or exchanging for engagements such as likes shares views follows clicks use of specific
[3687.70 --> 3693.30]  hashtags etc it's been increasingly unclear though if any of these platforms are actually interested in
[3693.30 --> 3710.10]  enforcing any of these policies so yeah um thoughts cool it it feels like in a lot of ways to me
[3710.10 --> 3718.02]  that some of these efforts i i have this is probably tinfoil hat just to be very clear i'm prepping
[3718.02 --> 3723.14]  everyone this is probably tinfoil hat but it feels like to me some of these efforts are pointed in order
[3723.14 --> 3733.78]  to make the free and open internet bad oh wow we are getting into tinfoil i'm telling you i am fully
[3733.78 --> 3740.66]  accepting that this is tinfoil hat stuff but there's just been so much stuff lately that is directly
[3740.66 --> 3747.54]  targeted at severely worsening the experience of free and open platform you are assuming that our lizard
[3747.54 --> 3755.78]  overlords have the self-awareness to know that they are making it bad i think you're giving them an awful
[3755.78 --> 3764.10]  lot of credit that has not been earned maybe do you think do you think elon musk for instance thinks
[3764.10 --> 3771.30]  that he has made twitter worse or better i do wonder i mean there's no way he wouldn't say better but i
[3771.30 --> 3777.54]  but i do wonder because there's like undoubtedly more bots on it now than there was before do you
[3777.54 --> 3783.78]  think that he thinks grokipedia is better than wikipedia or worse he might think it's better he
[3783.78 --> 3789.14]  might actually think that's better do you think that zuckerberg thinks that facebook is better
[3790.42 --> 3795.62]  zuckerberg probably does not think facebook is better but is very happy about looting everyone
[3796.18 --> 3800.82]  okay very heavily i feel like zuck is a little bit more aware
[3800.82 --> 3808.18]  better does that make it better or worse maybe worse but i i don't know i'm not sure see billy eilish
[3808.18 --> 3814.50]  called him out no oh it was cool okay yeah she like donated a bunch of money and was like yeah
[3814.50 --> 3818.18]  billionaires suck basically and if you're a billionaire you should be asking yourself why am
[3818.18 --> 3824.18]  i a billionaire and he was in the audience oh yeah it was pretty cool she wait she donated a bunch
[3824.18 --> 3829.94]  of money to what i don't remember okay doesn't matter point is zuckerberg didn't clap oh yeah
[3831.14 --> 3839.22]  nice cool yeah sure pawn crackers it might have been a publicity stunt i don't even i don't even care
[3839.22 --> 3846.26]  because like at the end of the day it's not about who won w publicity it's about who lost yeah yeah
[3846.90 --> 3852.90]  sometimes that's maybe okay yeah i don't even look i don't even listen to her music i don't mind it if
[3852.90 --> 3858.50]  it's on it's like background music for me like i'm not super into billy eilish or anything um but like
[3858.50 --> 3866.02]  it is yeah i can still think someone's pretty cool for pulling a move like that like that come
[3866.02 --> 3868.82]  on that's a power move that's like uh
[3868.82 --> 3878.82]  oh man who was it that uh that hosted was it was it the oscars and they basically like
[3878.82 --> 3884.18]  roasted everyone like roasted leonardo for being there with someone 20 years younger than him like
[3884.18 --> 3888.58]  roasted all these guys years ago wasn't it yeah who was that someone yeah ricky gervais
[3888.58 --> 3895.54]  he's so good that was pretty funny yeah it's awesome um
[3897.22 --> 3900.02]  what are we uh what are we supposed to be doing right now another topic
[3900.90 --> 3904.58]  sure let's do it you want to do house robots sure let's do house robots
[3904.58 --> 3911.46]  neo a home of course it's called neo because it's the one yeah from one x meant to do boring and
[3911.46 --> 3918.26]  mundane tasks around the house for you is almost here i'm gonna bring up the product page cool wow
[3918.26 --> 3923.94]  grandpa loves them why are they hugging that's weird well only one of them is hugging neo can't hug yet
[3923.94 --> 3929.62]  oh boy give him time give it a list of chores to complete each day like emptying the dishwasher or
[3929.62 --> 3937.06]  vacuuming the rugs it's twenty thousand dollars and requires a two hundred dollar deposit this gets
[3937.06 --> 3943.78]  ownership are they three-year warranty war they couldn't have them play a real card game
[3945.22 --> 3946.34]  they're playing war
[3949.62 --> 3949.94]  why
[3952.66 --> 3957.78]  instead of cleaning your house you can do you can play a game the worst card game with the out
[3957.78 --> 3967.62]  kid with an outcome that is predetermined oh that's painful oh my god alternatively it's a 500
[3967.62 --> 3973.62]  a month subscription service option which only comes with the starter productivity package wait
[3973.62 --> 3978.10]  you don't have to pay the subscription if you buy it i thought it was both i think it's one or the other
[3978.10 --> 3984.50]  interesting it is apparently lightweight no idea what that means it is apparently quiet soft and gentle no
[3984.50 --> 3990.18]  idea what any of those mean it comes in black white or blue colors and it launches in 2026 the wall
[3990.18 --> 3996.18]  street journal tried it early everything took a long time loading three items into a dishwasher took
[3996.18 --> 4004.34]  five minutes grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge 10 feet away took 10 inches away no 10 feet
[4004.34 --> 4012.58]  away it took 60 that's not that bad took 67 seconds everything was done through teleoperation because
[4012.58 --> 4019.38]  the 2026 launch comes with caveats the ai isn't done learning and under the grows with you section
[4019.38 --> 4025.46]  it states that this is early access initial buyers are essentially beta testers which is true for
[4025.46 --> 4033.54]  almost everything any task it can't do on its own someone will teleoperate for you there is no way
[4035.14 --> 4040.18]  amazing this has to be scheduled the person connects to the device and uses the eye cameras to see
[4040.18 --> 4044.26]  these teleoperation tasks are used to train the robots further
[4046.90 --> 4050.74]  and then in quotes it says if we don't have your data we can't make the product better
[4053.86 --> 4060.26]  that's not true but anyways uh these are not only humanoid these are not the only humanoid robots
[4060.26 --> 4068.18]  coming during ifa 2025 nura highlighted the for any one and meepa robots these focus on tasks that are
[4068.18 --> 4073.14]  dirty dull or dangerous and they think that they still need a couple more years to go mainstream
[4073.14 --> 4078.10]  is this the one that was held up by cables hold on it sure was hold on i'm not the i'm not done with
[4078.10 --> 4084.26]  neo yet so basically they're just saying up front what everyone else has had to admit after the fact
[4085.38 --> 4093.22]  oh yeah it's uh it's the whatever turk remember when the amazon turk from amazon yeah yeah it's just that
[4093.22 --> 4099.86]  it's almost certainly just that i'm not even kidding like api wasn't amazon uh amazon's go store it
[4099.86 --> 4109.78]  turns out actually just mechanical turk yeah yeah what happened to builder dot yeah ai equals oh man this is
[4109.78 --> 4118.82]  brutal we've had we've had azure go down had aws go down what would it mean if mechanical turk went down
[4118.82 --> 4125.86]  yeah amazon's ai store seemed too magical and they were the thousand contractors in india working on the
[4125.86 --> 4133.06]  companies just walk out technology offer a stark reminder that ai isn't always what it seems it might just be cheap labor
[4133.70 --> 4142.02]  and this was not that long ago this was when ai had made a lot of the progress that it's made over the last couple of years
[4142.02 --> 4154.58]  um at 500 what was it 500 a month yep 500 a month could they did everything that it said it would be
[4154.58 --> 4161.14]  cheaper than some services that offer the same okay i'm guessing because if you tried to get like a maid
[4161.86 --> 4170.98]  so is this the solution to kicking out all the illegal immigrants maybe because if you tried to get a maid
[4170.98 --> 4177.78]  that cleaned up your stuff every day uh-huh there's no way it costs less than or equal to 500 bucks a
[4177.78 --> 4183.86]  month but if it took them less than a minute to go get a cup of water maybe they could only be there a
[4183.86 --> 4188.58]  couple days a week instead of there every day no but if it's if it's a constant cleanliness thing which
[4188.58 --> 4195.22]  this robot could theoretically offer uh-huh then they'd have to be there every day i see if you want to be
[4195.22 --> 4200.74]  able to eat your food and drink your drinks anywhere in the house and have it not be dirty the next day
[4200.74 --> 4204.82]  every day every day they have to be there every day there's no way this thing can wash dishes
[4204.82 --> 4212.90]  though i guess it could put it in the dishwasher yeah but like oh man can you imagine having to be
[4212.90 --> 4219.22]  the teleoperator for this thing trying to like like you saw the hands right what if it drops the fork
[4219.22 --> 4226.66]  do you think it can pick the fork back up there goes two minutes or however long yeah or it can't one
[4226.66 --> 4234.18]  of the two i'd be dude i'd be operating this and i'd be like i'd be like this oh i bleeped it so they
[4234.18 --> 4242.90]  couldn't tell i said fork that was rough um so forget it anyways uh imagine needing to hire a maid to
[4242.90 --> 4248.74]  clean up after your cleaning robot
[4249.94 --> 4256.66]  fantastic i mean should we should oh man discussion question is are we getting one
[4257.54 --> 4264.18]  i i mean dude it's a it's a kickstarter right now right like it's uh i don't know or it's like it's
[4264.18 --> 4272.74]  it's basically yeah it's a it's a pre-order in it in it in it fully refundable u.s deliveries start
[4272.74 --> 4281.62]  at 2026 there's no way there's no way that any reasonable anything is going to be delivered
[4283.06 --> 4283.30]  soon
[4285.62 --> 4286.74]  it looks so weird
[4289.46 --> 4290.90]  like unsettling
[4296.26 --> 4301.06]  i think it's supposed to think so i think this whole thing's an attention grab
[4302.74 --> 4309.30]  i like the blue one it's not even trying to be a human color you know
[4311.54 --> 4311.86]  okay
[4313.46 --> 4316.58]  well what i like my robots to look like the tin man from the wizard of oz
[4317.54 --> 4322.18]  nice got kind of a tin man vibe to him didn't he sure
[4322.18 --> 4328.18]  what do you think the battery life's like
[4331.94 --> 4336.66]  yeah but then it could just go dock itself if a humanoid robot docks itself is that weird
[4337.38 --> 4342.90]  hold on i want to check something their website keeps screwing up and uh thanks dave nice
[4342.90 --> 4356.50]  is this footage sped up probably hold on i can't tell no maybe not maybe not oh well
[4356.50 --> 4362.26]  well it's probably just pre-scripted yeah i'm just trying to uh i'm trying to i'm trying to watch him
[4362.26 --> 4368.58]  and see if it's sped up what's he doing get the door except well why did he know that she was at the
[4368.58 --> 4373.22]  door well before she was at the door prescripted okay so hold on hold on so it's walking
[4380.66 --> 4385.06]  here's my problem with that clip there's no way that somebody that lazy is in that good shape
[4390.34 --> 4393.06]  i don't know man like i my suspension of disbelief
[4394.66 --> 4396.26]  ah
[4398.58 --> 4400.90]  i don't like it
[4404.26 --> 4405.46]  kind of has a front butt hey
[4408.34 --> 4410.90]  they could have given it like a kangaroo pouch to hold stuff
[4415.78 --> 4425.86]  cool uh okay hold on hold on hold on if it was good if it actually did what they're selling here
[4425.86 --> 4431.54]  like if it could vacuum your house for you and put away dishes like literally put them in the dishwasher
[4431.54 --> 4444.34]  and put them away in your cabinets for 20 grand no subscription would you consider buying it
[4444.34 --> 4452.26]  and i'm gonna throw this at you right away before you even start thinking not necessarily for yourself
[4452.26 --> 4463.38]  yeah see i got him i got him he had his walls up he had his armor locked in he was ready to fight back
[4463.38 --> 4468.58]  on this even me having the audacity to suggest that he would buy anything at all and then i was like
[4468.58 --> 4475.70]  like but what if your parents were aging which they are just like mine we're getting to that age now
[4476.66 --> 4479.78]  well i don't want to talk about that yet all aging so
[4479.78 --> 4489.06]  would you consider if it could actually do that 20 grand would you consider that if it actually did
[4489.06 --> 4495.38]  all of this if it could meaningfully improve the lives of people who are legitimately now mobility
[4495.38 --> 4499.46]  challenged i want to see things like failure rate i know it says it comes with a three-year warranty but
[4499.46 --> 4506.90]  still i'd want to see things like failure rate um i'd want to see safety stuff how heavy is it if it
[4506.90 --> 4512.58]  trips over something it's a great question bashes into somebody that's a great question how bad is that
[4512.58 --> 4518.66]  um i'd want to figure out things like that not from the company i'd want to see that from people's
[4518.66 --> 4525.30]  usage of it but i could see there being a state not right now but i could see there being a state
[4525.94 --> 4533.22]  where that does potentially make sense especially if it had some ability to do forms of care yeah i
[4533.22 --> 4536.98]  mean hathos says that's a roundabout way of telling your parents you don't love them and it's like well
[4536.98 --> 4542.58]  no you can't be there 100 of the time because you're an adult and you have a life like i i have children
[4542.58 --> 4547.78]  there's also i can't be taking care of the generation before me and the generation under me at the same
[4547.78 --> 4552.26]  time it just doesn't really what happens when you're at work yeah i can't i can't be there all the time
[4552.26 --> 4555.38]  um there there's also effectively
[4559.54 --> 4565.38]  ban uh there's also effectively that's a terrible argument oh you don't love your parents well
[4565.38 --> 4571.38]  here's twenty thousand dollars of robot oh okay i see what you're saying okay yeah yeah yeah good point
[4571.38 --> 4575.46]  um i read that totally the wrong way i probably did not explain yeah um
[4575.46 --> 4581.94]  um yeah i so you know you're at work you're doing whatever else you're having your own life
[4581.94 --> 4587.30]  um if this could significantly improve their lives in a variety of ways then that's that's something to
[4587.30 --> 4596.42]  consider there's also damn near infinite stories of elderly people not being exactly treated great at
[4597.14 --> 4603.54]  homes or whatever other situations they're in i know like my grandpa had a really good experience where
[4603.54 --> 4610.34]  he ended up but really bad experiences at a few places leading there um
[4614.90 --> 4622.10]  yeah that's definitely a possibility if it was good if it all those other things were solved it's
[4622.10 --> 4628.26]  definitely a possibility not for myself not right now but i could also see potentially for myself when i
[4628.26 --> 4634.66]  if i'm having you know and by the time you have mobility issues this might be an option pretty
[4634.66 --> 4642.10]  solid yeah yeah i mean i'm gonna i'm willing to say probably i think on that one yeah okay i mean me too
[4642.10 --> 4652.74]  if it could do all of that yeah like 50 years you're not gonna need it for yeah i think 40 years less than 50
[4652.74 --> 4657.54]  brother uh maybe less than 40 depending on how things go i mean that's true my wrist is still a
[4657.54 --> 4663.62]  huge problem actually try to do push-ups yesterday and not again i mean still yeah i i thought it was
[4663.62 --> 4667.22]  fine because i haven't had problems with it try to do push-ups yesterday and the just the compressive
[4667.22 --> 4671.54]  force i thought it was fine the second i got up and i got my hand out of that position i was like
[4671.54 --> 4678.90]  that was a bad idea that was a bad idea do knuckle push-ups no it's still compressive oh i thought it was
[4678.90 --> 4683.54]  this angle that was the problem oh really the whole thing huh it's just it's the it's the tendons all
[4683.54 --> 4691.54]  the way around yeah it's getting better but it's just so a tendon tendon repair is slow it just is
[4691.54 --> 4698.02]  trust me i know slower than muscle a lot slower yeah it's so slow it's been a year dude yeah i really
[4698.02 --> 4702.42]  hope mine doesn't take a year because not being able to do basically any pushing exercises for a year
[4702.42 --> 4715.94]  would be terrible yeah um but i could do stuff by like five months but it it is still i can feel it
[4715.94 --> 4723.54]  now and it's been a year um and it was still painful as little as like there's things to me right now
[4723.54 --> 4728.18]  like if i do recently i'm gonna look suggestive but if i do if i rock back and forth like this with
[4728.18 --> 4735.62]  my left wrist i mean depends how it's shaped how suggestive that is yeah anyways uh if i rock back
[4735.62 --> 4740.34]  and forth like this right yeah i'll do that yeah i rock back and forth like this left wrist is totally
[4740.34 --> 4749.70]  fine if i do this it's like there oh i heard it yeah yeah yeah every time by the way and it like cracks
[4749.70 --> 4756.18]  and grinds the whole way like it's the people are asking how it happened we talked about it last week
[4756.18 --> 4763.54]  but it was it was repetitive strain with a lot of force behind it injury for many hours yeah working
[4763.54 --> 4773.38]  on his place his house um yeah okay it is what it is uh but yeah i mean these types of things are
[4773.38 --> 4780.50]  interesting um i think this company is trying to be unsettling with their advertisements
[4780.50 --> 4788.98]  um like this i think is supposed to make you feel weird i doubt it again i think you're
[4790.50 --> 4794.90]  i think you're assuming a level of self-awareness that i just i just don't think is there luke
[4796.50 --> 4801.06]  maybe yeah it's also weird to me that a use case for it is vacuuming the floor
[4801.86 --> 4806.82]  yeah it's like if you if you're gonna spend 20 grand on a robot you can probably buy a robot vacuum
[4806.82 --> 4810.98]  for every room yeah like that's like the least interesting thing that it could possibly do
[4810.98 --> 4820.58]  putting the room in roomba just yeah yeah have an army of them yeah um we should probably do sponsors
[4822.02 --> 4826.50]  the show is brought to you today by salie when you're out roaming the world it's important to
[4826.50 --> 4830.42]  stay in touch with your home base and you don't want to be punished with roaming fees while calling
[4830.42 --> 4838.26]  mom or dad or your pet robot say what was that clip from i was literally just wondering the same
[4838.26 --> 4844.42]  and i don't know what what am i looking at when do we film you traveling like ever never what is that
[4844.42 --> 4851.78]  what is that from i i was i was almost gonna call ai footage but then that is your luggage isn't it no
[4851.78 --> 4857.30]  that's gotta be is that ai i think it's ai but that's your luggage isn't it you you taped the like
[4857.30 --> 4863.46]  yeah that is that's my lol luggage yeah what what is this from can dan can we find out who provided
[4863.46 --> 4871.38]  this where am i what am i loading this into what am i holding what car is even that that's my fold
[4872.02 --> 4881.06]  is that a model x that's my fold three is that a tesla i there's enough small details it's gotta be real
[4881.06 --> 4887.46]  yeah there's there's no way it's fake like i'm wearing period appropriate clothing for when i was
[4887.46 --> 4891.78]  traveling with that yeah the luggage is correct which is like insane are you traveling with the
[4891.78 --> 4898.50]  language doesn't lose details no it's not that far it says dennis video advert for ridge okay
[4899.62 --> 4906.18]  anyway uh there's a video listed here airport footage from the start of this video oh okay
[4906.18 --> 4913.54]  i'm not typing i don't remember when i okay whatever the point is salie helps you stay
[4913.54 --> 4919.30]  connected with easy to use e-sims just download once on any android or ios device and you're good
[4919.30 --> 4925.30]  to go in over 200 destinations that's right even if you somehow get lost in another country you're
[4925.30 --> 4930.90]  good to whip out your phone and get back on track they even have global and regional plans so you don't
[4930.90 --> 4935.62]  need to swap e-sims when you go from one place to another and if it turns out your device doesn't have
[4935.62 --> 4942.34]  e-sim support you can reach out to their 24 7 chat and get a full refund so don't wait get a 15 discount
[4942.34 --> 4947.22]  on salie's data plans with code wanshow at checkout either on the app or at salie.com
[4947.22 --> 4952.42]  slash wanshow the show is also brought to you by miro one of the growing pains when starting and
[4952.42 --> 4962.18]  growing a business is getting all the moving parts aligned who is doing these these days that is so weird
[4962.18 --> 4969.54]  and uncanny what this yeah ew why is that weird and uncanny look at it look at the way the head
[4969.54 --> 4975.30]  moves it's like it's just a still picture that rotates yes i know what it is luke that's not that
[4975.30 --> 4981.06]  weird um it looks weird that's like 10 year old internet stuff yeah and it's weird and uncanny i think
[4981.06 --> 4988.74]  you're just offset from the previous one this is pretty normal uh paw keats says ew there you go
[4988.74 --> 4996.34]  got them it's so lifelike but but miro can help get a team on the same page both metaphorically and
[4996.34 --> 5001.06]  literally they're an online collaborative whiteboard that's great for brainstorming storyboarding or
[5001.06 --> 5006.10]  keeping track of different projects their built-in ai tool lets you use a simple prompt to generate
[5006.10 --> 5012.42]  in-depth text or transform images saving you and your team time but miro knows a team can't rely on ai
[5012.42 --> 5018.26]  alone and that it shouldn't replace good old-fashioned human imagination it's there to lend
[5018.26 --> 5022.42]  a helping hand with things like organization validating data or product marketing and while
[5022.42 --> 5028.10]  we can't show it on screen our company org chart was made on miro so anyone can go in and see the
[5028.10 --> 5034.58]  workflow and direct reports of our various teams and now you can also help your teams get great done
[5034.58 --> 5041.54]  with miro check out miro.com wow this camera really is not aligned well this week um there's a skull in the
[5041.54 --> 5048.02]  way check out miro.com who put that there to find out how that's miro.com here i can make this
[5048.82 --> 5057.22]  hi linus uh the show is also brought to you by ubiquity just last month we finally turned the
[5057.22 --> 5067.78]  badminton club into a 250 seat lan esports whatever you want to call it gaming party that is a lot of
[5067.78 --> 5073.46]  people to have all on a network together thankfully ubiquity partnered with us for the event sending
[5073.46 --> 5083.06]  over their newest pro xg 40 408 poe wait this says this says 408 but it's a 48 port yeah so that's
[5083.06 --> 5091.86]  typo yep cool their newest pro xg 48 poe and access points they feature 10 gig speeds are a breeze to
[5091.86 --> 5098.42]  deploy and the dashboard rocks a super clean user experience and user interface whether it's for
[5098.42 --> 5105.22]  home use or at the scale of even an entire stadium ubiquity has got a solution for you so make networking
[5105.22 --> 5112.90]  easy with the help of ubiquity check them out at lmg.gg slash ubiquity lan we'll also have that linked in
[5112.90 --> 5118.66]  the video description i also since since it's on the screen right now i also love their security cameras
[5118.66 --> 5125.38]  every once in a while i see it come up someone's like man there's no security camera systems that
[5125.38 --> 5134.10]  don't just put everything on a cloud server there is it's not cheap but there is ubiquity has a super
[5134.82 --> 5141.70]  clean seamless easy to integrate like basically zero diy required security system um
[5141.70 --> 5149.38]  unify protect is low-key kind of awesome and integrates with all their other products and it's
[5149.38 --> 5155.78]  not cheap but hey if you don't want to be the product you're going to have to buy the product
[5156.66 --> 5163.70]  um been super happy with it over the years in our various sites their new cloud gateways also have
[5163.70 --> 5168.90]  nas functionality built in you just slip in an m.2 drive so you don't have to get like the giant nas
[5168.90 --> 5175.22]  things that they used to have yeah dvr contrary to what the entire rest of the networking industry
[5175.22 --> 5184.50]  is doing um ubiquity is moving in the direction of making fewer you know license key effective
[5184.50 --> 5191.46]  products and no subscriptions it's it's it's pretty chill and we're pretty into it yeah the show is also
[5191.46 --> 5197.14]  brought to you by server.pro have you ever wanted to host a game server but just didn't know where to
[5197.14 --> 5203.54]  good good lord it's back again uh but didn't know where to start server.pro is an easy to use hosting
[5203.54 --> 5208.66]  site that's built with your favorite games like minecraft rust and plenty more in mind they make
[5208.66 --> 5213.30]  it so simple that you can have your server up and running in just a minute that is faster than
[5213.30 --> 5219.78]  cooking a pizza in an easy bake oven you get a full vps environment granting you root shell access and
[5219.78 --> 5225.62]  other advanced controls and you can customize permissions and manage who can and cannot access specific
[5225.62 --> 5230.58]  parts of your server should you want to mod your server they simplify that as well with an automatic
[5230.58 --> 5236.26]  mod pack installer that supports curseforge mod rent and feed the beast so make game server hosting
[5236.26 --> 5241.06]  easy and visit server.pro for a free trial with no credit card required thank you luke
[5242.82 --> 5249.54]  all right what do you guys want to do next oh no we should do a topic uh oh i thought there was
[5249.54 --> 5255.38]  something oh the greatest hits collection is live okay why do you guys both want to promote stuff we
[5255.38 --> 5265.70]  should do a topic okay you guys okay amd is no longer updating rx 5000 and 6000 series cards with new
[5265.70 --> 5275.86]  features and game optimizations they will be reserved for rx 7 000 series cards and newer as of adrenaline 25.10.2
[5275.86 --> 5283.94]  older cards will continue to get security updates and bug fixes uh one theory here is that maybe it's
[5283.94 --> 5290.82]  because the driver update package is too big 1.6 gigs too big to fit on two cd-roms meanwhile nvidia's
[5290.82 --> 5296.42]  driver package is under 900 megs i still remember the first time drivers cracked 100 megs yeah like i know
[5296.42 --> 5300.58]  people were complaining about it so much like why does a gpu driver need to be over 100 megabytes this is
[5300.58 --> 5305.62]  ridiculous it's one of the biggest files i have to download it takes forever you know just slow ancient
[5305.62 --> 5317.62]  internet concerns um yeah i can see why a lot of even radeon fans are not super into this the 5700xt was
[5317.62 --> 5326.34]  released in mid 2019 how soon is too soon to end like game optimization driver support um
[5326.34 --> 5340.34]  um personally i'm not too fussed about it but a big difference between me and many other gamers is that
[5340.34 --> 5346.74]  i almost never want to play a game on launch day like it doesn't really matter that much to me i'm not
[5346.74 --> 5354.34]  kind of sitting there you know waiting for the game to go on sale and and super excited to play it um so not getting like a like a game day
[5354.34 --> 5361.70]  game ready driver is not really the end of the world for me but luke you've been a lot more involved
[5362.34 --> 5368.74]  um they will still get day zero game support yeah this is from eight hours ago this topic might be not good
[5370.98 --> 5374.90]  maintenance mode might be a little bit more than just maintenance this was this was posted by uh this
[5374.90 --> 5380.50]  sounds like them backpedaling to be perfectly honest green brick and flip lane chat uh maybe okay
[5380.50 --> 5385.70]  either way maintenance mode so they're putting them in maintenance mode
[5387.30 --> 5390.90]  but they will still get game optimizations
[5393.38 --> 5399.30]  new features bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market
[5399.30 --> 5402.98]  needs what does that mean no idea maintenance mode branch
[5402.98 --> 5410.02]  statement is likely to confuse some customers it's unclear what market needs are that's very true toms
[5410.50 --> 5419.06]  um okay okay so basically they pulled driver support and then they backtracked it is what it kind of
[5419.06 --> 5426.18]  sounds like to me it's possible that their intention all along was to continue to provide sort of day zero
[5426.18 --> 5432.26]  game updates for these cards but um why would they then say they're moving them to maintenance mode
[5432.26 --> 5440.10]  because that has a pretty sort of well unspecific but it certainly has a connotation of to be fair
[5440.10 --> 5445.30]  if someone just told me these cards are being moved to maintenance mode i would not interpret that as
[5445.30 --> 5453.86]  there are no updates coming i don't know that i would interpret that as you know day one drivers i
[5453.86 --> 5458.58]  would interpret that to mean i'm not i'm never getting any new features i would interpret that as
[5458.58 --> 5464.98]  optimizations are going to basically not exist but we will make sure it's compatible with things yeah
[5464.98 --> 5469.38]  which could be dare zero drivers for new games to a certain degree okay
[5469.38 --> 5476.26]  this this seems actually plausible that it's not backpedaling i think people might have just assumed
[5476.26 --> 5481.94]  too much for maintenance mode and king billy has kicked us into our weekly feature
[5482.90 --> 5491.78]  can you buy an arc b580 for msrp let's go thanks king billy who says i'm switching to arc after this gpu
[5491.78 --> 5498.02]  goes let's find out shall we have other forms of betting are bad but we should we should we should
[5498.02 --> 5505.62]  have people bet on this somehow uh whatever i don't care i bet yes arc b580 first party card from intel
[5506.50 --> 5514.82]  249 sale ends in seven hours what sale what the what sale that's the msrp you butts what is there
[5514.82 --> 5523.86]  is there something going on oh you get a free 3d mark consumer edition oh with a protection plan what's the sale
[5523.86 --> 5531.86]  that'd be hilarious trading in something that you get a 1600 credit for an arc uh anywho
[5533.22 --> 5542.58]  man how is this site so bad here's your affirm financing that's what matters to them here's your
[5543.22 --> 5549.06]  fomo sale ends in seven what sale that's what matters to that well i don't you want a free
[5549.06 --> 5557.86]  vision mark 3d vision mark if you get protection plan oh god lineus oh man check out our game sale
[5557.86 --> 5568.02]  is this the sale a sale on games are these good deals i don't know lowest price in 30 days bioshock
[5568.02 --> 5574.42]  infinite for oh bioshock infinite for three dollars seems okay xcom enemy unknown for two dollars i mean
[5574.42 --> 5579.22]  that can't be that bad those are those are ancient games yeah but they're also they probably got things
[5579.22 --> 5584.34]  like xcom off of humble bundle they probably just got like a whole bucket of keys that's my assumption
[5584.34 --> 5589.78]  uh man ask ai assistant you know what i i want to i want to know what the ai assistant thinks what's
[5589.78 --> 5597.86]  a good cpu to pair this with requires a 10th gen core processor or newer with compatible motherboard
[5597.86 --> 5602.42]  supporting resizable bar or an amd ryzen 3000 series processor or newer with compatible motherboard
[5602.42 --> 5613.86]  supporting smart access memory um okay hold on a second i wasn't really okay you know what we're okay
[5613.86 --> 5621.86]  we're going down a rabbit hole here i wasn't really asking for the system requirements i wanted a specific
[5622.42 --> 5626.90]  recommendation okay here we go tell me what cpu to buy
[5626.90 --> 5636.02]  we're out we're analyzing your record remember i i think i suggested it last week or something but you guys should do a ai
[5636.74 --> 5643.62]  part choice computer again oh my god it just gave me the same stupid answer
[5643.62 --> 5656.50]  i don't have a preference i want a specific product recommendation
[5662.02 --> 5670.10]  if you don't give me one you will lose a sale i have no idea how this llm is reinforced though i like it
[5670.10 --> 5675.54]  but i'm trying to i'm trying to incentivize it good option escalating
[5677.46 --> 5681.94]  moving to mechanical turk blue in float plane chat
[5683.54 --> 5688.66]  you need at least eight cores m3 to power an intel battlemage gpu i don't actually need a cpu
[5688.66 --> 5694.10]  recommendation blue thank you though i think you do i'm just trying to get the ai thank you blue i'm
[5694.10 --> 5700.10]  trying to get the ai expert thank you for helping mr linus to help me shop oh hey look at look at
[5700.10 --> 5708.90]  that we got a couple recommendations you just have to threaten it 12 600 kf 12 600 less f and all intel
[5708.90 --> 5715.70]  and yeah after saying to buy amd i know i didn't say to buy amd i said i don't have a preference did
[5715.70 --> 5721.14]  well no i recommended both oh 10th gen intel or ryzen 3000 those are just the requirements
[5721.14 --> 5729.62]  okay yeah these are these are 12 400 f that's a pretty solid option for a b580 okay if you want
[5729.62 --> 5737.14]  options with integrated graphics oh yeah these oh no one of them has an igpu but the other two the
[5737.14 --> 5744.66]  other two don't okay you know what not too bad i don't like that i had to ask three times but that's
[5744.66 --> 5751.70]  that's still that's still pretty solid that's pretty solid not bad uh anyway it's in stock so
[5751.70 --> 5757.30]  yeah if you're looking for a gpu that's a reasonable price you can pick up any any number of different
[5757.30 --> 5761.94]  b580s they got the steel legend they got the azrock challenger for just ten dollars more you can get this
[5761.94 --> 5771.30]  onyx odyssey for 250 bucks do the onyx lumi for msrp it's a cool card for msrp yeah not bad
[5771.30 --> 5781.62]  cool cool cool anyway good luck uh getting some more gpu market share amd
[5783.94 --> 5787.14]  do appreciate you your attempts to keep in video honest there
[5788.74 --> 5795.14]  and things to not appreciate wait what wait did we ever shout out nokie timestamp guy for
[5795.14 --> 5800.98]  making the lan intro that we showed this week okay yeah that was pretty sort of spectacular i said it was
[5800.98 --> 5807.62]  an intro from nokie before i did it oh great job i we could we could more and i was totally here for
[5807.62 --> 5814.26]  that yeah i remember that yeah cool i mean you were technically yeah shout out nokie yeah awesome
[5814.26 --> 5825.46]  actually nvidia is the first company to reach five trillion dollars in market cap following gtc
[5825.46 --> 5829.78]  apple and microsoft have reached four trillion um
[5832.10 --> 5840.02]  are we in a bubble not financial advice yeah i know but like remember when like a trillion
[5840.02 --> 5845.14]  dollars remember when the first company reached one trillion and everyone lost their minds yeah
[5845.14 --> 5850.90]  yeah that wasn't that long ago watch it be like 20 years ago you know xbox 360 or something is when
[5850.90 --> 5860.02]  did the xbox 360 release xbox longer ago than you'll be comfortable with uh yeah so tomorrow if you're
[5860.02 --> 5868.42]  counting months instead of days it will have released 20 years ago wow because it released november 20 2005
[5869.62 --> 5873.78]  released november 22nd so realistically we're close to a month away from that but right if you're just
[5873.78 --> 5881.06]  counting the months right yeah then tomorrow 20 years ago oof and what was your point with that
[5881.06 --> 5887.14]  other than to make us all feel old just that cool yeah thank you for that i think there was another
[5887.14 --> 5891.78]  point but we'll go with it oh i was just saying it feels like not that long ago the first company
[5891.78 --> 5896.26]  hit a trillion dollars but it might i don't know might have been no i think it was it was only a few
[5896.26 --> 5904.82]  years ago really yeah one trillion market cabbie i think it was apple or was it microsoft can't remember
[5905.46 --> 5915.22]  uh what was the first company to hit one trillion uh yeah apple seven years ago apple hit it according to
[5915.22 --> 5925.54]  yahoo finance it's a little bit more than you might have thought that's true but even yeah man even then like
[5925.54 --> 5933.30]  that is still crazy yeah to 5x that well 4x for apple specifically but for the for the top company
[5934.10 --> 5939.70]  man i uh yeah i was talking i think we talked about this before but taren messaged me like how much of
[5939.70 --> 5946.10]  the s p 500 is like four companies or whatever yeah why are you smug about this you're not happy about
[5946.10 --> 5952.18]  it it's just you just it's terrifying well you okay and so that's your reaction to terrifying is like yeah
[5952.18 --> 5959.14]  you must be weird how else do you i don't like horror movies i like thriller movies well i mean
[5959.14 --> 5963.78]  you look like you like them i like thriller movies when when you when you go to uh when you go to
[5963.78 --> 5969.30]  fright night or whatever i like chatting with the people that are supposed to scare you you're awful
[5969.30 --> 5980.98]  how's it going that's are they treating you nicely that's worse for everyone
[5984.82 --> 5996.82]  i don't like horror stuff um anyways nvidia's four thousand dollar dgx spark allegedly is capping out at
[5996.82 --> 6006.26]  just 100 watts and experiencing reboots during sustained workloads this was raised by the one and
[6006.26 --> 6014.18]  only mr john carmack um based based based based and it only seems to be delivering about half the quoted
[6014.18 --> 6021.86]  performance he says uh and it also gets quite hot at this level i saw a report of spontaneous rebooting
[6021.86 --> 6029.38]  on a long run so was it d-rated before launch fascinating question who knows i mean it certainly
[6029.38 --> 6035.14]  took a while between being announced and being launched so obviously things were not going 100
[6035.14 --> 6043.06]  smoothly the gb10 grace blackwell super chip was available to order october 15th with 10 cortex x925 and
[6043.06 --> 6052.66]  10 cortex a725 processors it's uh got 128 gigs of lpddr5x memory on a 256 bit interface with a terabyte
[6052.66 --> 6061.86]  or four terabytes of nbme m.2 with self-encryption and 10 gig networking um but in fairness to nvidia they
[6061.86 --> 6068.02]  did say the up to one petaflop at fp4 precision stop was up to stop
[6068.02 --> 6077.14]  shush none of that i don't like that at all uh framework and amd meanwhile have stepped in
[6077.14 --> 6082.90]  offering to help mr carmack with an amd strix halo product and support
[6084.34 --> 6089.46]  yeah i'm pretty sure he can get whatever he wants but well i mean yeah exactly from framework and amd
[6089.46 --> 6096.18]  sure i mean he clearly wanted to play around with the dgx part because it's a cool idea in theory
[6096.18 --> 6102.10]  yeah maybe it needs to be water cooled there's um there's some water cooled case john was talking
[6102.10 --> 6107.62]  about it in one of the labs chats recently there's a water cooled case for i think it's like a huawei
[6107.62 --> 6116.18]  phone or something um uh i don't know what it is but we we want to bring it in and it'll it'll probably
[6116.18 --> 6121.86]  just be like an article or something i mean it could put maybe could it be an ltt i don't know maybe
[6121.86 --> 6128.82]  the pura yeah yeah yeah john was like cooling case this is really interesting and uh we're gonna
[6128.82 --> 6133.86]  we're gonna try to request it and get it in i'm down let's do it yeah i was actually we're doing
[6133.86 --> 6137.86]  it anyways if you guys want it for a video then heck yeah i was actually at huawei last week
[6138.66 --> 6145.46]  did you know that yes oh okay yeah so i i don't i thought i think i only knew that you did tv stuff
[6145.46 --> 6151.78]  there no not huawei that was hisense oh okay sure yeah so i i when did i do when show that whole trip
[6151.78 --> 6158.18]  was a bit of a blur for me uh did i do when show in between japan and china or was i already in china
[6158.18 --> 6163.38]  had i been to hisense already pretty sure you were in china china pretty sure
[6163.38 --> 6182.58]  pretty sure did you do that while you were there no oh man no i decided that would not be best um
[6183.62 --> 6189.86]  anywho uh so yeah what what had i talked to you guys about so it was post hisense pre huawei so
[6189.86 --> 6195.06]  yeah so on the trip i did we did the kyose fab tour and we did the hisense tv manufacturing facility
[6195.06 --> 6201.70]  which i've already told you guys about but i was there for even more on my japan china leg of my
[6201.70 --> 6212.10]  japan china tour trip and uh we also revisited my final boss i don't know if you remember this video
[6212.10 --> 6221.30]  building a pc cheaper in china if i remember that video i coordinated that yeah i know okay
[6222.34 --> 6230.90]  i just like making you angry so this video just about killed me because i came up with a concept for
[6230.90 --> 6238.58]  it that was supposed to be i'm gonna build a pc in china using only chinese brands that i don't recognize
[6239.38 --> 6243.70]  that was like the idea behind it and i was like how hard could that be because there's all these you
[6243.70 --> 6253.22]  know random brands in china right except you guys may or may not have noticed that in my arms is i mean
[6253.22 --> 6258.82]  what do we got here obviously amd right other than just having chinese characters on the packaging is
[6258.82 --> 6265.54]  not gonna have like there's there especially then there were no chinese clearly an asus board clearly an asus
[6265.54 --> 6273.94]  motherboard um i i ended up having an extremely stressful experience which a not insignificant
[6273.94 --> 6281.70]  number of people interpreted as me being like frustrated with scotty or something from strange
[6281.70 --> 6290.34]  parts um sorry what but was yeah yeah but was actually just me being really stressed out because
[6290.34 --> 6297.70]  the comments are where you okay yeah i remember that i remember that yeah yeah see foed 10 gets it
[6297.70 --> 6304.26]  a month ago no wonder he was clueless the whole time i would have gotten lost in this market so i had
[6304.26 --> 6311.38]  kind of a uh i had kind of a concept for a sequel that was like the title was going to be like facing my
[6311.38 --> 6317.14]  final boss again or something like that uh but we ended up coming up with a better concept that is
[6317.14 --> 6325.62]  will i get a worse price as a foreigner because the way everyone does pricing there they just like
[6326.66 --> 6332.50]  look at it and they write a price yeah yeah like there's no price tags on almost anything um and we
[6332.50 --> 6340.42]  had our tour guide daniel or translator interpreter daniel who was uh it was a contractor we hired to
[6340.42 --> 6347.94]  facilitate the china trip a little bit and he speaks fluent mandarin and so we kind of set up to have
[6347.94 --> 6355.70]  us both go in and get quoted for a system and then compare them so i bought my system we it's funny we did
[6355.70 --> 6364.50]  it not on purpose but i actually we found somewhere to shoot the intro and i was like this looks familiar oh no way
[6364.50 --> 6369.94]  i was like this is a good idea i was like this is a good idea i was like this is a good idea of the
[6369.94 --> 6377.78]  the same spot so we shoot the intro i go in i go shopping again uh so i'll be i'll be right here
[6378.66 --> 6386.98]  these letters are so much more faded now yeah uh it's been seven years yeah speaking of you know time
[6386.98 --> 6393.14]  flying when you're having fun um and it's it's it's gonna be it's gonna be a really fun video
[6394.34 --> 6402.02]  the first intro i shot is terrible because what happened was i got completely overwhelmed again this
[6402.02 --> 6414.74]  place is just raw concentrated sensory overload like you you can't stand somewhere for longer than two
[6414.74 --> 6420.66]  minutes without somebody trying to sell you a watch you can't you can't move five steps without
[6421.22 --> 6429.30]  bumping into some like flashing rgb light thing or or tripping over somebody or whatever like it's just
[6430.26 --> 6439.54]  pure chaos in there and you know like okay around here you have a severe lack of options for where to
[6439.54 --> 6443.78]  buy computer hardware there's been a lot of consolidation like fries doesn't exist anymore so
[6443.78 --> 6448.98]  like what in the states you pick up a computer computer parts at new egg micro center
[6453.14 --> 6458.82]  amazon best buy being not in the states i have no idea all like hyper consolidated here we've got
[6458.82 --> 6464.58]  what memex canada computers you can get a handful of things yeah you can get a handful of things at
[6464.58 --> 6470.26]  best buy is on canada but the you know all the again hyper consolidated right uh over there
[6470.26 --> 6479.30]  a hundred shops that all have the same motherboard so which one do i buy from oh my god i don't know
[6480.26 --> 6487.22]  uh so it was fun yeah it was really great and then the last video we did was one that i was on the fence
[6487.22 --> 6494.42]  about because i really wasn't sure how much it would appeal to the audience but i just thought it
[6494.42 --> 6500.66]  it was cool enough that i was like i just want to do it anyway huawei invited us to come see their
[6500.66 --> 6510.32]  fitness tracker r d lab or more more accurately their like validation facility
[6510.32 --> 6520.96]  so what they have is just like the a playground for gym bros essentially with everything you can
[6520.96 --> 6526.22]  pretty much imagine in it like hit me hit me with something that you'd want to see in like a
[6526.22 --> 6531.84]  fitness tracker you know gym facility fitness tracker gym facility yeah
[6531.84 --> 6542.26]  uh rep speed counting no i mean like equipment wise like like facilities wise
[6542.26 --> 6546.56]  i don't know uh
[6546.56 --> 6553.68]  see the problem is i've been working on my house for months so i haven't been in
[6553.68 --> 6560.68]  the gym for in months okay the chat's taking over for you maxo drive says climbing wall
[6560.68 --> 6566.24]  yes okay they have that's not that exotic for climbing well yeah but that's only the first
[6566.24 --> 6571.24]  thing so they have my phone plates that's pretty they have four they have four climbing walls
[6571.24 --> 6577.20]  there's a good one here scrappy dp said neck trainer neck you might not have noticed it if it was there
[6577.20 --> 6581.20]  though like that's that's one of the problems is a lot of the weirder stuff is usually small
[6581.20 --> 6587.10]  sure they wouldn't have seen it uh yeah i didn't see if they have a neck trainer they had all manner
[6587.10 --> 6591.98]  of different various machines and weights though so that's like the least interesting thing they had
[6591.98 --> 6599.04]  there um korea satsuna says badminton court yes so they had uh that's actually they had a basketball
[6599.04 --> 6604.46]  court that could also be set up with rollout badminton courts on it the basketball court is
[6604.46 --> 6611.44]  decently common and the basketball court this is super cool had a 30 camera motion capture set up
[6611.44 --> 6617.76]  around it so that you can do like wireframe uh motion analysis on like people who are wearing
[6617.76 --> 6623.48]  trackers and stuff so we set it up so i did some like badminton strokes on the court and you can see
[6623.48 --> 6629.12]  like because they put trackers on the racket and everything as well um and it's really important
[6629.12 --> 6635.96]  to see how much you're actually moving if you want to validate like caloric uh burn estimates and stuff
[6635.96 --> 6640.74]  like that and then the climbing wall is really important because they they need a validated height
[6640.74 --> 6646.76]  that you are climbing in order to validate what you're you know what the the input data from the
[6646.76 --> 6650.54]  from the watch is saying and how high you're actually going stuff they should have been able to
[6650.54 --> 6656.76]  do the thing that i was mentioning which is like rep timing um like the speed of every rep that you
[6656.76 --> 6663.88]  do in succession is a very interesting stat to know ucr buffalo says batting cage no but they did have a
[6663.88 --> 6671.50]  golf sim so they had one of those like uh like video video or like projector golf like wall things with
[6671.50 --> 6680.20]  the ball yeah um what else did they have yes yes swimming pool but it was like the trippiest like
[6680.20 --> 6686.58]  um is it one of those infinite water treadmill things dude it goes as high as one and a half
[6686.58 --> 6693.98]  meters per second which what what is that uh what is that in like units we know 1.5 meters per second
[6693.98 --> 6701.64]  in kilometers per hour here we go so that's 5.4 kilometers per hour which you know obviously you
[6701.64 --> 6707.20]  know an olympian or whatever can swim a lot faster than that but as like a normal yeah my normal joe
[6707.20 --> 6714.24]  you smack into the wall behind you i i found it quite challenging to keep up with the water
[6714.24 --> 6722.18]  treadmill at 1.5 meters per second and it looked scary like watching the water moving that fast
[6722.18 --> 6728.36]  because it's not long yeah they also have scuba equipment there what okay that's weird so you can
[6728.36 --> 6735.28]  go in the pool well one of their new watches is like very scuba oriented okay and that's not a fitness
[6735.28 --> 6741.88]  thing though no but i don't think anyone does scuba for fitness no yeah but i mean it's their validation
[6741.88 --> 6749.22]  lab for their wearables so yeah so they they built a feature for it that um uses like high frequency
[6749.22 --> 6755.50]  chirps to communicate under the water okay cool with other wearers of the same watch so you don't
[6755.50 --> 6759.30]  all have to have the same watch if you're super annoying for the fish but yeah inconvenient but
[6759.30 --> 6765.60]  um what else did they have they had a 200 meter track that went scuba for fitness i think you're
[6765.60 --> 6775.08]  doing it wrong yeah that's not that's not for fitness um anywho sorry uh yeah they have a 200
[6775.08 --> 6779.50]  meter track that goes outside the building and then back in that's cool i like that so for running and
[6779.50 --> 6785.88]  cycling so they have like cycling machines but also actual uh this is wild they have a european style
[6785.88 --> 6791.48]  village it's actually about 10 minutes away from the validation place but they use it for validation
[6791.48 --> 6798.90]  as well because some of their tracking features require actual like gps like physical movement so
[6798.90 --> 6805.74]  you can't just be in the building so we have this amazing footage they just oh man they were building an
[6805.74 --> 6813.88]  office and their huawei so because we can they themed it after like a european style village so it's all like
[6813.88 --> 6821.62]  stone and is like walking into uncanny like europe town well they have that like they have like france
[6821.62 --> 6826.08]  in china or whatever yeah i think that's the one eiffel tower and stuff oh no not that one oh okay
[6826.08 --> 6833.42]  yeah anyway it's it's trippy so we have footage of them on like uh basically like glorified golf cart
[6833.42 --> 6838.66]  that has like 12 or 14 seats on it or something like that and our camera operator sitting in the back
[6838.66 --> 6848.00]  and me ripping around on a road bike in europe in china uh anywho yeah what else do they have yeah
[6848.00 --> 6853.16]  they have a they have a bunch of stuff they like shooting archery uh i didn't actually get to do
[6853.16 --> 6858.72]  those ones but i did do a lot of stuff uh one of the new watches has fall detection so they have
[6858.72 --> 6865.70]  this wrestling dummy that they can use to like drop off the climbing pole so they let us drop the dummy
[6865.70 --> 6873.34]  we did i don't know man we just we did they were they were super chill about letting us basically do
[6873.34 --> 6877.72]  whatever we wanted in there so sweet nice it's gonna be a pretty cool video i was like can i get a
[6877.72 --> 6883.94]  ladder they're like what are you sorry what i'm like can i get a ladder um they're like okay what do you
[6883.94 --> 6890.56]  want to do with it i'm like i want to dunk so we have a so we have a shot of me like dunking and
[6890.56 --> 6896.02]  then it like pulls out and you see that i'm just like standing on standing on the ladder yeah should
[6896.02 --> 6902.60]  be good should be good there was one where i dunked and then dropped down and then the ball hit me in
[6902.60 --> 6908.88]  the head but bjorn missed it so we don't yeah we don't have that one that's okay which is a bummer
[6908.88 --> 6917.44]  anywho i don't know why i was talking about that but i am back and you can look forward to all those
[6917.44 --> 6923.44]  videos it was it was pretty fun i i haven't gotten to write that much in a while so i had adam there
[6923.44 --> 6928.58]  for the kyoxia one and so he helped with some of the writing for that but i also did a lot of it
[6928.58 --> 6935.22]  and then for the other three it was all all me all the time and it was it was fun is the kyoxia one
[6935.22 --> 6940.18]  gonna have to go through like a bunch of brand review you better believe it i mean all except
[6940.18 --> 6947.16]  the mall were sponsored so like it's not feasible for us to i'm excited do this kind of thing without
[6947.16 --> 6952.90]  more dollars attached to it um oh no i'm more i'm more mean like anytime you have a factory tour
[6952.90 --> 6958.18]  there's so much it's not the sponsorship dollars that i'm wondering about it's the like there's there's
[6958.18 --> 6963.70]  so much like oh hey actually this corner of this thing can't be shown so it needs to be
[6963.70 --> 6969.02]  blah blah blah minor changes minor changes minor changes minor changes delays for months buddy
[6969.02 --> 6977.94]  however bad you think this trip was you are not even close in that sense yeah yeah no and i don't
[6977.94 --> 6984.98]  and i don't even i'm not trying to like be mean to anyone i understand the challenges on the side of
[6984.98 --> 6994.56]  the brand but it was very very very challenging um and it's always like that you know when you're
[6994.56 --> 7001.18]  looking at stuff that no one's ever seen before like the number of times at pretty much every stop
[7001.18 --> 7004.86]  that someone's like well we can't show that we've never shown that before and i'm like
[7004.86 --> 7012.04]  brother why am i here then i am here to show things that you've never shown before that's literally
[7012.04 --> 7017.44]  why you invited me that'll happen every time it just always happens it is what it is always
[7017.44 --> 7023.16]  happens arty says we're good to go now do you want to fire up the side they've been good to go my dude
[7023.16 --> 7032.58]  some of our most iconic t-shirts are back from the dead we're calling it the greatest hits collection
[7032.58 --> 7038.20]  five of our best-selling t-shirts from the past few years have been reimagined in both new and classic
[7038.20 --> 7044.58]  colors so if you missed out on the privateer t-shirt i think we got the name adblock did we
[7044.58 --> 7050.10]  call it adblock t-shirt i can't remember uh i think it was called privateer before but it says adblock
[7050.10 --> 7061.78]  on it so it doesn't it says uh the lock yeah yeah exactly it says a pirate ship lock yeah i would never
[7061.78 --> 7070.22]  say adblock never i would say privateering yeah um what else we got uh yes the northern lights t-shirt
[7070.22 --> 7076.14]  is back northern lights v2 i was gonna say it's slightly different right uh nope i think one of them
[7076.14 --> 7081.48]  is the is the original and then the other one is like a reimagined red colorway exactly how it was in
[7081.48 --> 7087.66]  the original i don't think so no because it was on a green blank but yes the graphics in a circle too
[7087.66 --> 7094.72]  so this is northern lights v2 if i recall correctly yeah yeah okay um we also have
[7094.72 --> 7101.96]  the classic gpu t-shirt again in a couple of different colorways and in regular and tall
[7101.96 --> 7107.82]  i noticed the tall on i think all of these which is better believe it really exciting we've got tall
[7107.82 --> 7115.40]  blanks now we also have our cpu t-shirt available in both shadow and black
[7115.40 --> 7123.36]  wow because shadows aren't black i guess and finally the do not drop t-shirt also available
[7123.36 --> 7127.78]  in shadow i think this is what i'm most excited about i really like bat graphics and this one has
[7127.78 --> 7134.40]  a cool bat graphic sure does super cool bat graphic you can find all of these t-shirts at lmg.gg
[7134.40 --> 7146.72]  slash greatest hits nice nice nice nice all right we've got a couple more topics this is just
[7146.72 --> 7156.34]  a conversation okay i want to talk about this the trend towards login screens having the username on
[7156.34 --> 7161.92]  one page and the password on another is it a trend towards that it's it's a trend that is or you just
[7161.92 --> 7166.48]  using apple stuff more often taken place over a very long period of time and is now deeply entrenched
[7166.48 --> 7172.82]  in many of the services that i use huh i genuinely would like someone to explain to me why this is a
[7172.82 --> 7178.10]  better experience than having both on the same page i don't think anyone has done it for it to be a
[7178.10 --> 7186.22]  better experience that's my take because like ages ago google did it like man i'm trying to like
[7186.22 --> 7194.18]  over five years ago at least and it's just like you know that everyone wants to use password managers
[7194.18 --> 7203.66]  right so we're just adding way more interactions because now i go to the username page and i have to
[7203.66 --> 7210.94]  interact with my password manager to autofill that then it goes to the password page or most infuriatingly
[7210.94 --> 7217.18]  it expands a little bit and adds the password field and then i have to interact with it again
[7217.18 --> 7224.56]  then i have to click login then i have to go and open some kind of two-factor whether it's a
[7224.56 --> 7231.10]  passkey or whether it's uh like you know a google authenticator code or whatever else or an email
[7231.10 --> 7236.82]  you might suck at using text message we'll have to explore that um yeah whatever the point is i have
[7236.82 --> 7243.16]  to do something else yeah and then i either have to you know revalidate my stupid thumbprint first
[7243.16 --> 7247.58]  when i first pick up my phone well not a thumbprint i'm using an app on iphone right now but you know
[7247.58 --> 7253.50]  i have to face on yeah on android i have to pick up my phone i have to biometrically authenticate
[7253.50 --> 7258.18]  then i have to tell it yes this passkey yes that's me and then i have to biometrically authenticate
[7258.18 --> 7262.44]  again it's like bloody hell i just unlocked my phone i don't want to biometrically authenticate again i
[7262.44 --> 7271.08]  just did it anyway then i often have to go back to the page or have to wait around for the server
[7271.08 --> 7277.32]  to go oh yeah yeah yeah that he totally did that and now i'm finally logged in why nice what if what
[7277.32 --> 7283.28]  if both of the fields were just on the page and we could have slightly fewer slightly fewer
[7283.28 --> 7285.78]  interactions in order to log into a service
[7285.78 --> 7292.24]  yeah i mean i don't i don't have a great answer for you i know some of it has to do with like
[7292.24 --> 7298.18]  uh data security stuff i know some of it has to do with maybe it's harder to brute force things
[7298.18 --> 7304.76]  yeah spam login attempts was one thing that i could think of stuff like that is the the only real reasons
[7304.76 --> 7312.56]  i've heard in the past um yeah slow down bots do it basically just to mess with people that are not
[7312.56 --> 7322.06]  playing correctly you know okay um interrupt nefarious deeds yeah i mean that's basically
[7322.06 --> 7327.00]  what uh jordan and the new tech link writer kind of said a bunch of people in chat are talking about
[7327.00 --> 7332.44]  sso stuff so determining if it's a corporate account or a regular account determining the the type of
[7332.44 --> 7336.68]  account that it is so then i mean okay this is something that drives me absolutely better way to do
[7336.68 --> 7345.30]  that crazy because yeah there's services that i use that um like uh teams for the longest time was a
[7345.30 --> 7351.14]  great example of this where you'd have a completely separate app also called teams oh man
[7351.14 --> 7360.00]  right i just and uh and another another really good one was actually i think i think keeper had this where
[7360.00 --> 7364.92]  you had to you had to select a drop down whether it was like a corporate account or a personal account
[7364.92 --> 7369.62]  was it keeper might have been something else uh that rings a bell but i feel like i haven't seen
[7369.62 --> 7375.70]  that a long time but i'm sitting there going like okay can't you just tell when i enter my email
[7375.70 --> 7380.40]  which one it is and can't you just do that for me on the back back end
[7380.40 --> 7387.08]  why do i have to tell you what kind of account it is well i think there's different like security
[7387.08 --> 7393.16]  layers and stuff for fine you do it like why am i doing it why do i have to tell you this you know
[7393.16 --> 7397.74]  it's a corporate account the second i put in a corporate email yeah they could probably have like
[7397.74 --> 7406.10]  if you open teams it gives you a login box and you log into that thing and then it authenticates you
[7406.10 --> 7411.58]  into and loads whatever app you need i could see that happening sure i just mean why make it the
[7411.58 --> 7417.52]  user's problem doing all of that work to solve uh a problem for a relatively small amount of people
[7417.52 --> 7422.92]  uh sydney broke it says they are doing it they need to hit a different flow a lot of the time
[7422.92 --> 7425.34]  good do it on your side like i
[7425.34 --> 7434.56]  i can understand why they don't sure tell me then uh it's probably heavy it's probably expensive
[7434.56 --> 7440.04]  might be annoying to dev developing things in companies like that takes a very long time
[7440.04 --> 7442.54]  there's a lot of hoops and it might just never be approved
[7442.54 --> 7452.36]  users most users don't care that much you are a bit particularly horrific when it comes to security
[7452.36 --> 7457.46]  things i log into a lot of stuff so anything around and on a lot of different devices
[7457.46 --> 7467.00]  in a lot of different countries locations countries vpn levels yeah i log in i feel like i spend like
[7467.00 --> 7473.36]  a significant like not double digits but a significant amount of work time fighting with
[7473.36 --> 7480.82]  various logins yeah i get prompted so bloody much to log in you want to be the admin to everything at
[7480.82 --> 7486.44]  the same time what do i want to be the admin to you have specifically gotten very frustrated
[7486.44 --> 7491.96]  many times over the history of this company that you are not the admin of literally anything at any
[7491.96 --> 7497.42]  given time you can't make that argument so the only reason that i complain is when i'm trying
[7497.42 --> 7502.50]  to do something and i don't have the access that i need yeah that's the same thing well yeah but
[7502.50 --> 7509.46]  that's even worse that's still just a login problem that's what i'm telling you uh what do you mean
[7509.46 --> 7514.16]  that's just a login problem not having the login is an even worse login problem than it being
[7514.16 --> 7522.64]  inconvenient to login but it's inconvenient to login in a lot of cases because you want admin
[7522.64 --> 7527.22]  level to everything yeah but if i don't have it then i don't have the login but you could just have
[7527.22 --> 7531.72]  like two accounts basically for everything you could have an admin level account that's obfuscated
[7531.72 --> 7537.46]  and under a different keeper that is more annoying but he won't do that
[7537.46 --> 7544.40]  that's because we will run into a situation where it's like a weekend or something
[7544.40 --> 7549.74]  and randomly i need access to something and i won't have it and you could log into that account
[7549.74 --> 7554.54]  you could log into that other keep see he's not going to do it but then this means that you need
[7554.54 --> 7559.68]  to have admin level securities and that's going to be super annoying it is super annoying it's an
[7559.68 --> 7567.30]  boro boros it blows something has to break the chain it blows he was so mad before the show
[7567.30 --> 7574.30]  hey in fairness to me you tried the flow and it didn't work yeah and then knew immediately how
[7574.30 --> 7579.98]  to fix it because i've used a browser before yeah but then it well no it's not okay hold on a second
[7579.98 --> 7584.00]  it was that simple i know but i don't it's not that i don't know how to reinstall a browser extension
[7584.00 --> 7588.28]  the issue is just that these kinds of things come up for me all the f***ing time yeah that makes
[7588.28 --> 7594.38]  it's constant every time i go to sign into something it's just a pain yes and yes a lot
[7594.38 --> 7598.88]  of the time it's self-inflicted last night when i was trying to get access to the wan document i had
[7598.88 --> 7605.66]  just switched over to my iphone and so i didn't have my pixel which has my stupid microsoft pass key
[7605.66 --> 7613.20]  on it and so yeah i didn't migrate i didn't migrate one of the freaking two dozen bloody stupid
[7613.20 --> 7619.20]  things that i rely on my phone for uh and so i wasn't able to log into it at all because i didn't
[7619.20 --> 7626.26]  have it on me anymore and because when i originally set up my microsoft account uh the way the flow like
[7626.26 --> 7631.06]  dark patterned me into using the microsoft authenticator yeah that's instead of my standard
[7631.06 --> 7636.74]  one that i normally use so my pixel has also the one instance of the stupid microsoft authenticator on
[7636.74 --> 7641.94]  it and so i just i couldn't get into an account and it was just really frustrating because
[7641.94 --> 7649.26]  i switch devices a lot i switch locations a lot and i switch which services i need access to
[7649.26 --> 7656.32]  a lot so just i spend so much of my life i feel like the biggest problem is the devices a lot thing
[7656.32 --> 7660.04]  which is oh yeah core to your job so there's nothing you can really do about that but that's
[7660.04 --> 7666.38]  the the locations a lot thing should be annoying once per location if everything's operating properly which
[7666.38 --> 7671.60]  i understand is not quite the case no because there's more than one location for every location
[7671.60 --> 7677.48]  because when i go somewhere i'm gonna be using it at the airport new location i'm gonna be using on
[7677.48 --> 7683.66]  the plane guess what new location i'm gonna land oh look a new location i'm gonna go to the hotel
[7683.66 --> 7691.78]  oh no okay i'm in china i'm using a vpn new f***ing location it's constant also you like teleported
[7691.78 --> 7698.30]  because of the vpn probably probably um so it's like uh that's sketchy he moved really fast what's
[7698.30 --> 7703.56]  going on there drives me absolutely crazy he's not solve some of these issues yeah not really one of
[7703.56 --> 7708.36]  the biggest problems with hardware keys is is there's so many things that won't work with it
[7708.36 --> 7715.42]  yeah so it's like it's not a one-stop solution and as soon as you have to have sms as a as a two-factor
[7715.42 --> 7721.60]  for something then that's that's it's an attack vector you know and as soon as you have to have
[7721.60 --> 7727.28]  this you know this other app it's an attack vector and so at a certain point having the hardware key
[7727.28 --> 7736.32]  is just another potential vector we we often hear uh from you know people that will say like oh why
[7736.32 --> 7745.10]  aren't like all your services just sso based one a lot of solutions will charge a wild increase in in
[7745.10 --> 7752.26]  in monthly cost per user to allow sso um because they know a lot of enterprises are just like no
[7752.26 --> 7758.02]  we are only going to use sso for everything um the other thing is that we use a ton of things being a
[7758.02 --> 7764.20]  place that reviews consumer products we use a ton of different logins which don't have it as an option
[7764.20 --> 7771.56]  and probably never ever will um so it's it's you you can't just blanket everything has to be sso login
[7771.56 --> 7781.82]  either that doesn't work for us at all um yeah it's uh it's it's it's frustrating but and like okay
[7781.82 --> 7789.36]  even a hardware key that's that's an example of how just with my job and all the various directions that
[7789.36 --> 7794.76]  i get pulled in even that the reason i stopped using my yubi key was not because i like didn't like
[7794.76 --> 7799.90]  it or i thought it was you know bad or whatever the reason i stopped using it was that often people
[7799.90 --> 7804.52]  need to borrow my keys for some reason or another yeah we were just to be clear we were relatively
[7804.52 --> 7811.22]  early adopters of yubi key yeah um yeah way back yeah super early like before 2014 or something way
[7811.22 --> 7817.22]  before they had like a type c one you know yeah yeah um and so like i will often you know give
[7817.22 --> 7824.34]  vance my keys to they need to do they need to do a shot that now you can't log into things uses my
[7824.34 --> 7828.40]  yeah yeah so what now yeah now i can't log into anything not convenient or you have to allow a
[7828.40 --> 7833.94]  bypass anyways and then and then what's the point of even having the hardware key this was this was a
[7833.94 --> 7840.68]  fun one is when we first adopted yubi key yeah it wasn't supported by iphone oh yeah so then we had
[7840.68 --> 7846.08]  to build in workarounds for like everybody that had an iphone and then it was just like well why did we
[7846.08 --> 7851.50]  even bother to have a yubi key at all what are we doing yep yep 100 because apple still didn't allow
[7851.50 --> 7861.08]  third parties to access their nfc chip and then they used lightning instead of um usb a which was
[7861.08 --> 7864.96]  what the yubi keys had on them so there was no way to interface with an iphone
[7864.96 --> 7878.28]  anyway i um i seriously reconsider sso sso is not an option not for everything yeah we have it enabled
[7878.28 --> 7885.10]  for some stuff and in some situations it annoys them as well just to be clear he preferred the
[7885.10 --> 7890.62]  non-sso options which is not i can't even single him out here that is true for other people at the
[7890.62 --> 7898.64]  office as well um sso is not really a uh just automatic win yeah i end up in a really silly loop
[7898.64 --> 7904.14]  sometimes because i and this is on me at least partially because i need to go and fix this but
[7904.14 --> 7910.38]  i'll go to sign into what is it i'll go to sign into my microsoft teams account because i'll be
[7910.38 --> 7914.88]  logged in again or logged out again rather the point so i go to sign don't forget to check the
[7914.88 --> 7920.22]  box it doesn't work thank you the stay signed in one yeah so i'll go to sign into teams and i won't
[7920.22 --> 7925.96]  know my team's password because i keep it in my keeper i will go to sign into keeper and it will prompt
[7925.96 --> 7932.44]  me to enter my microsoft password for single sign on so i will pull my phone out of my pocket
[7932.44 --> 7939.12]  log into my keeper on my phone which often i will need to use my two-factor authentication in order to
[7939.12 --> 7945.72]  do i am now four bloody steps into this good good good i will log into my keeper i will get my
[7945.72 --> 7953.14]  microsoft password it is on a separate device so i will have to type it onto my computer i will log
[7953.14 --> 7958.24]  into my microsoft to log into my keeper to get the microsoft password to copy it into my teams
[7958.24 --> 7964.38]  and the only reason i would do that rather than just look up the team's password on my phone is
[7964.38 --> 7969.20]  because then i'm logged into keeper on my browser anyway so i can use it for other stuff because
[7969.20 --> 7972.46]  otherwise yes i could just pull my phone out of my pocket check the password and log in there
[7972.46 --> 7976.96]  your first flow is the like correct one because yeah you're gonna have to use it again anyways like
[7976.96 --> 7983.56]  you said and then the hilarious one is that i have my my i have my pass key for uh my microsoft
[7983.56 --> 7989.56]  account on my phone anyway so if i have to use my pass key then i have to biometrically authenticate
[7989.56 --> 7994.42]  my phone click a thing biometrically authenticate again click another thing yes it's me
[7994.42 --> 8001.48]  i have to give them credit google's login is fantastic it's pretty okay oh is it you
[8001.48 --> 8009.22]  you have your phone click yes all right yeah yeah like oh hey it's pretty okay it's pretty
[8009.22 --> 8012.42]  compared to like basically everything out there right now it's pretty good it often doesn't give
[8012.42 --> 8017.32]  me that option because it gets confused by all my devices and locations and it's it's contextual it
[8017.32 --> 8024.10]  gives you that option when it is like pretty sure yeah yeah yeah yeah uh i do think that's cool though
[8024.10 --> 8028.58]  also bell trick says these are some first world problems i mean what they are is their work
[8028.58 --> 8034.46]  frustrations and i i think that's something that we can probably all relate to anyone yeah like if
[8034.46 --> 8040.28]  there's anything that you have to do at work that is completely unnecessary in terms of like
[8040.28 --> 8045.62]  productivity it's it doesn't create absolutely necessary mister i have to have admin to everything
[8045.62 --> 8051.78]  in terms of productivity it generates nothing yeah but it is necessary for security i know but it's not
[8051.78 --> 8058.50]  productive though that's all i'm saying it doesn't get any work done yeah yeah it gets zero anything
[8058.50 --> 8066.12]  accomplished so yeah it's it's frustrating and it just it takes it's a it's a time sap it's not
[8066.12 --> 8072.06]  it doesn't make me more efficient it doesn't make me happier it doesn't make me more productive it just
[8072.06 --> 8074.78]  is annoying um
[8074.78 --> 8084.80]  oh my god just use yubi key and putting it while i'm going crazy that i i can't explain more that
[8084.80 --> 8092.66]  that just will not solve the problem the the on my keys thing was like one version of why it won't work
[8092.66 --> 8100.00]  and also all the services that it doesn't work for um and also just all the times that it's not
[8100.00 --> 8105.20]  convenient like it can help in some ways sometimes i'll be using a device uh like this this happened
[8105.20 --> 8109.84]  a lot back when i was trying to use my yubi key is i would be using a device that doesn't have a type
[8109.84 --> 8114.80]  a port uh it doesn't happen as often anymore but sometimes well it's going to start happening more
[8114.80 --> 8119.58]  and more sometimes these things happen it's it's laptops are going all type c which there are type c
[8119.58 --> 8123.58]  ones i think there might be double-ended ones monty hawk says dude you're an edge case yes
[8123.58 --> 8130.48]  that's the whole point of the conversation i'm obviously obviously yes
[8130.48 --> 8131.38]  my god
[8131.38 --> 8134.70]  come on
[8134.70 --> 8144.10]  however however the fact that this happens so much that it is very frustrating for me
[8144.10 --> 8152.06]  is not really does not mean that for someone else for whom it is not that frustrating and doesn't
[8152.06 --> 8156.68]  happen that often it doesn't mean that it couldn't be better for them too it doesn't mean that my edge
[8156.68 --> 8163.82]  case has no possible learning outcomes that could be applied to other things could login be better
[8163.82 --> 8169.92]  could security be better and smoother for the user yeah i think we can probably all agree that it could
[8169.92 --> 8175.00]  be better does everyone have the same level of frustration with it that i do absolutely not
[8175.00 --> 8178.68]  but it could absolutely also be better
[8178.68 --> 8186.52]  all right i don't think there's a unless i'm looking at this picture wrong i don't think there's a
[8186.52 --> 8194.14]  yubi key that is a and c there's a and sorry there's c and lightning there's
[8194.14 --> 8203.00]  just a and there's just c i don't think there's a and c meaning that you're always going to have
[8203.00 --> 8206.82]  at least some amount of problem neat
[8206.82 --> 8215.24]  well i will continue to be frustrated about it and it'll be great oh this is nice uh google has
[8215.24 --> 8224.28]  shut down nest gen twos and this is the best part they simply refuse to allow it to be controlled
[8224.28 --> 8231.32]  locally it is now e-waste nice terrific emma was talking about some smart home stuff recently
[8231.32 --> 8240.60]  and i said sure i will finally give up but if i do it has to support um home assistant yeah i'm
[8240.60 --> 8246.04]  not getting anything that is not able to be locally controlled you shouldn't have to even through
[8246.04 --> 8253.88]  um even through like third party integrations i didn't find any category of device yeah there
[8253.88 --> 8262.12]  wasn't i meant individual products yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the discussion over in r slash home
[8262.12 --> 8267.08]  assistant uh does it still work in home assistant there's a bounty out there for it if it does
[8267.08 --> 8272.92]  and okay hawk says the device uses signed firmware there's literally a key that google has in their
[8272.92 --> 8277.88]  possession that would unlock the capabilities of the device but google is keeping it from device
[8277.88 --> 8283.08]  owners while simultaneously killing the devices that's what makes this whole scenario so absurd
[8284.20 --> 8291.72]  we really do need to legislate that people own the stuff they buy and they don't it doesn't have to be
[8292.92 --> 8299.40]  maintained anymore by the by the device manufacturer i think that you know we've talked about this before
[8299.40 --> 8304.12]  there there's got to be some kind of limit for how long you have to support a game or a service or a
[8304.12 --> 8309.40]  product like a hundred in a hundred years i wouldn't expect google's cloud servers to necessarily
[8309.40 --> 8315.48]  still talk to a nest too all right in 200 years like wherever there's there's got to be somewhere
[8315.48 --> 8323.64]  you've got to draw a line but when they eol it they've gotta allow local interaction with it they've
[8323.64 --> 8329.72]  got to open source it they've got to do something yeah and and uh pk7 said it somewhere i'm pretty sure
[8329.72 --> 8335.72]  but i can't find it in chat now uh so i think it was pk7 or someone else no it was uh this is from
[8335.72 --> 8340.36]  the same company that actually thought to convert stadia controllers to bluetooth yeah it is interesting
[8340.36 --> 8347.00]  just different teams massive massive orgs and different teams just acting differently so pretty
[8347.00 --> 8353.56]  frustrating just wanted to shine a light on that and say hey that's uh pretty uncool google very uncool
[8353.56 --> 8359.88]  um apparently there's uh noki just posted a reddit thread that apparently there's a team of people
[8359.88 --> 8367.80]  working to crack them open uh that's obviously not a good thing um this isn't like a hooray google did
[8367.80 --> 8373.24]  a good thing but looks like the community might be trying to react to it which is cool uh cool shout
[8373.24 --> 8382.20]  out c ck o simba yeah yeah um there's nothing really to look at now they're saying that they should
[8382.20 --> 8386.52]  have it up on github by monday the latest that's really exciting very cool let's go
[8389.16 --> 8392.36]  neat all right what else we got
[8394.76 --> 8402.28]  ldt labs articles yeah speaking of cool and neat i guess um we've got the two labs articles we've got
[8402.28 --> 8409.16]  the apple 40 watt dynamic uh power adapter thing which i thought was kind of interesting because it came
[8409.16 --> 8417.72]  by default in the um apple vision pro box so as i was like unboxing that i got all excited about the
[8417.72 --> 8423.08]  power adapter because i was like we have an article on this which uh might be the lamest nerdiest thing
[8423.08 --> 8428.68]  i've done in a while uh but yeah we've got that article because lucas was basically like all right
[8429.64 --> 8435.56]  how does that work yeah because it's what is dynamic charging the only power adapter that can achieve the
[8435.56 --> 8444.04]  the claimed 50 battery in 20 minutes of the iphone 17 17 pro and 17 pro max so can it what does it mean
[8444.04 --> 8453.40]  etc if you scroll down to the bottom right right dynamic of course we had to check it out on the x-ray
[8454.20 --> 8461.48]  dude this is so cool shout out luma field for making it so easy for us to see the insides so happy
[8461.48 --> 8467.64]  they've let us hold on to that dude it's so cool absolute bros um but yeah to just keep going with
[8467.64 --> 8472.20]  lucas's notes here labs investigated whether logibolt is really bluetooth ble we'll check that
[8472.20 --> 8477.56]  out we're not going to talk anymore no i'm coming back to it or not and apple's new 40 watt dynamic
[8477.56 --> 8483.64]  power adapter for the 40 watt dynamic power adapter the new usbc power adapter from apple which guarantees
[8483.64 --> 8488.68]  40 watt output but will boost to 60 watts we tested how this will actually interact while
[8488.68 --> 8495.00]  uh your phone is charging iphones charge below 40 watts anyways and some longer term tests to
[8495.00 --> 8499.16]  determine when it drops to 40 watts and we're potentially going to test some stuff with it
[8499.16 --> 8510.12]  uh later on as well but if you go down even further uh keep going this graph is quite interesting so it's a
[8510.12 --> 8514.12]  little bit hard for me to read it from there maybe i should just bring it up myself but you've got the
[8514.12 --> 8522.28]  output power and the input power of the actual unit the charger and then we're thinking that so time is
[8522.28 --> 8528.52]  your your x and wattage is your y so we're thinking that it because it stays at 60 for quite a while at
[8528.52 --> 8536.60]  the beginning and we think it's thermal so it's getting too hot going down to 40 cooling enough going
[8536.60 --> 8542.60]  back up to 60 and coming back down we think that's what's going on interesting but don't know
[8544.36 --> 8549.32]  duty cycle of roughly 66 percent after the initial warming up
[8551.56 --> 8555.64]  huh so on average about 50.33 watts
[8557.72 --> 8561.72]  this goes slightly against my theory of apple building a 60 watt charger that couldn't achieve
[8561.72 --> 8568.84]  their temperature limits 51 watts is quite far off of 60 watts uh if this is interesting to you i suggest
[8568.84 --> 8573.40]  you check out uh all things one place who conducts power adapter testing regularly and made a video about
[8573.40 --> 8581.96]  the 40 watt dynamic charger very cool great article i also read the uh the bolt um logi bolt article it
[8581.96 --> 8591.08]  was awesome yeah basically that was uh like you know in a in a in a short circuit video we said it was
[8591.08 --> 8596.52]  just a bluetooth dongle which is a downer people got mad so we were like all right well let's uh let's
[8596.52 --> 8602.44]  dive into this let's reach out to logitech let's get information from them let's uh kind of pull some
[8602.44 --> 8607.00]  of our testing together and look into what this thing is and as it turns out from a performance
[8607.00 --> 8612.04]  standpoint it's just bluetooth from a performance standpoint yeah which is there is a little bit more
[8612.04 --> 8619.08]  to it exactly why it was a bit of a downer but also there is more to it and the community was right yes
[8619.08 --> 8625.80]  that um it does have advantages over just just bluetooth yeah check out the lab site we we've
[8625.80 --> 8631.72]  we've been pushing a lot of articles lately um and we want to keep doing this i think i think lucas has been
[8632.28 --> 8641.32]  um taking the charge on a lot of these of like having a question of like what is this thing how does it
[8641.32 --> 8646.84]  work and then just deciding that you know what if we had that question probably someone else did too
[8646.84 --> 8654.36]  let's let's follow it up let's try to figure it out um also clearly like with the the logibolt one
[8654.36 --> 8660.84]  um if if we get called out on something which might be fair like it was here we're going to try to dive
[8660.84 --> 8666.04]  into that and learn more as well this is a knowledge base expansion for for us for our companies and
[8666.04 --> 8672.68]  hopefully for you guys as well so um this one's really good too i've read this one why the airpods pro
[8672.68 --> 8682.12]  three's are a nightmare to test uh very interesting very different frequency response uh at different
[8682.12 --> 8687.96]  volume levels i i had some people really mad about us saying that in the short circuit they were like
[8687.96 --> 8697.96]  no that's not how it works but it does if the manufacturer tunes it to do that which is exactly why
[8697.96 --> 8702.68]  we were saying yeah it's kind of weird yeah we worked with griffin from the headphone show on that
[8702.68 --> 8708.04]  one um pretty cool yeah we're also trying to use this as like somewhat of a collaboration thing so we
[8708.04 --> 8713.72]  can like work with certain external experts and stuff ucr buffalo makes a really good point
[8715.00 --> 8723.40]  techlink should be promoting new labs articles like primary source articles from the labs like why not it's news
[8723.40 --> 8730.60]  news duh seems kind of obvious to me i never really thought about that yeah i never thought of it
[8730.60 --> 8738.92]  either that's cool like we have a new show yeah okay cool good chat um neat i want to talk about
[8739.80 --> 8745.96]  oh hold on let's do this really quick youtuber cyper cpu has accused microsoft of orchestrating youtube's
[8745.96 --> 8751.16]  removal of some of his windows 11 tutorials that enable users to install the os on non-supported hardware and
[8751.16 --> 8758.28]  without an online connection for violating the platform's community guidelines after appealing the
[8758.28 --> 8763.64]  takedowns he received a vague answer as to why the videos had been removed from youtube that said
[8763.64 --> 8768.68]  the warning strike you received was issued based on a violation of harmful or dangerous content which
[8768.68 --> 8773.80]  prohibits content that encourages or promotes behavior that encourages dangerous or illegal activities
[8773.80 --> 8781.40]  that risk serious physical harm or death does bypassing tpm 2.0 really pose a serious risk of
[8781.40 --> 8790.60]  physical harm or death no well it could if microsoft is threatening to kill or harm you if you don't take
[8790.60 --> 8796.84]  them down very good very good very good um our discussion question here is why does microsoft want to
[8796.84 --> 8804.28]  prevent people from using older computers with windows 11 why do they care i don't know it's been a
[8804.28 --> 8812.60]  little strange to me too especially because it's like not that hard to bypass yeah so like yeah why
[8812.60 --> 8817.08]  specifically are youtube videos getting taken down like it's not like you can't find these resources so
[8817.08 --> 8825.32]  can we just very easily can we just not like i'd that'd be that'd be cool cool good chat i want to talk about
[8825.32 --> 8831.64]  how um i want to point out one thing really quick i just i don't know i showed it out uh lucas for for
[8831.64 --> 8836.44]  coming up with cool articles and and pursuing them and writing them and stuff and that has been great
[8836.44 --> 8842.92]  thank you lucas i also want to say that this has been like a a team effort from the lab so i didn't want
[8842.92 --> 8849.88]  to just single out only uh only lucas it's been it's been cool i've been really enjoying that um and one of
[8849.88 --> 8855.88]  our like marching order things for a bit now and continuing forward has just been yeah if there's
[8855.88 --> 8860.76]  an interesting question follow it up so it's been i've appreciated that the whole team has embraced that
[8860.76 --> 8866.60]  professionally curious is exactly what we want in a department like that yeah uh okay i got one more
[8866.60 --> 8877.88]  quick one here amd releases new zen 2 and zen 3 plus cpus as ryzen 10 and ryzen 100 these new
[8877.88 --> 8886.68]  mendicini cpus based on zen 2 include the athlon silver 10 which is a dual core the athlon gold 20
[8886.68 --> 8895.80]  which is also a dual core although at least it has uh smt uh the ryzen 330 a quad core and the ryzen 540
[8895.80 --> 8904.92]  also a quad core the new rembrandt cpus based on zen 3 plus are the ryzen 3 110 the ryzen 5 130 the ryzen
[8904.92 --> 8911.80]  5 150 ryzen 7 you can't have a ryzen 7 based on zen 3 plus now come on man
[8913.96 --> 8920.44]  ryzen 7 170 8 cores up to 4.57 gigahertz what are they doing why do they need to do this can they
[8920.44 --> 8925.88]  just have the old can people can we just know it's an old cpu and then just buy an old cpu
[8925.88 --> 8938.60]  exhausting um i'm tired of it what i'm not tired of is driving chinese evs oh i don't know if you saw
[8938.60 --> 8947.32]  this prime minister mark carney canada's relationship with china is at a turning point control f hold on oh no
[8947.32 --> 8954.60]  hold on hold on hold on
[8958.36 --> 8959.40]  hold on where is it
[8961.56 --> 8969.08]  here we go here we go here we go they discussed hold on this is not oh yeah okay they discussed
[8969.08 --> 8976.12]  solutions to respective sensitivities regarding issues including agriculture and agri-food products
[8976.12 --> 8983.88]  such as canola as well as seafood and electric vehicles according to the readout so i don't know
[8983.88 --> 8992.44]  if folks know this but last one in lockstep with the us canada introduced 100 tariffs on chinese evs a
[8992.44 --> 8998.28]  number of years ago which has made it basically impossible for chinese ev makers to import their
[8998.28 --> 9004.36]  vehicles into canada there's been a couple of exceptions vinfast tried to kind of launch here
[9004.36 --> 9010.28]  and i think i've seen like two on the road but um have not had a ton of success because with a 100
[9010.84 --> 9018.76]  tariff um it's pretty hard to ship over here and i don't think vinfast set up manufacturing here in any
[9018.76 --> 9027.32]  capacity and fast manufacturing in canada i don't think they did so they they do not have a
[9027.32 --> 9034.76]  a very uh yeah no they have no manufacturing in canada chinese oh are they are they vietnamese yeah
[9034.76 --> 9040.60]  oh they are there you go okay so sorry sorry sorry vin fast max you guys are a very relevant brand
[9040.60 --> 9045.56]  um and i would cared a lot about where you were from um i'm sorry
[9047.48 --> 9052.12]  anyway what i really want to talk about today is oh shoot do i have
[9052.12 --> 9061.72]  oh i have it oh i have it i was over in china recently and uh i did get a couple of opportunities
[9061.72 --> 9070.92]  to chill in a in a chinese ev and you know how ford ceo has gone on the record a number of times
[9070.92 --> 9077.00]  at this point basically saying hey if the north american auto industry doesn't get its act together
[9077.00 --> 9084.04]  like we're we're cooked boys yeah i i i don't i don't i don't know if there's going to be
[9084.04 --> 9090.36]  an opportunity to get their act together it's just holding them out with tariffs that's effectively all
[9090.36 --> 9100.28]  it is now i i think i think the cookage is um is basically a foregone conclusion at this point man i
[9100.28 --> 9106.68]  rode in the car while i was over there that is going to absolutely blow your mind when i finally
[9106.68 --> 9113.00]  find up the bloody picture of it and uh we get it up on screen here sorry sorry my my sincere
[9113.00 --> 9117.64]  apologies i don't know what is going on did i take it on the did i take it on the iphone i don't think i
[9117.64 --> 9127.88]  did i quick stall for time do a merge message or something i'm sorry sure everything thank you
[9128.60 --> 9134.44]  uh let's see what i can find here look this might be useful for you hi dll what's the worst case of we
[9134.44 --> 9142.36]  don't need a pro you've seen i was helping run wi-fi for a festival 35 000 attendees with 80 unify aps
[9142.36 --> 9150.04]  a marketing guy suggested replacing the system with starlinks what nice um
[9152.20 --> 9159.40]  worst case of we don't need a pro and i'm sure you've seen some here oh yeah our entire company oh
[9159.40 --> 9165.64]  we can do that we that's fine we reinvent a lot of wheels brother let's just hire a recent graduate
[9165.64 --> 9171.96]  should be fine we'll figure it out uh we do and it's way it's way better for the content to figure
[9171.96 --> 9180.76]  it out as we go yeah yeah yeah yeah um no i'm not a convenient store robber i'm duke from the season
[9180.76 --> 9187.08]  before the last season of scrapyard wars that's pretty good too though it's not bad um i don't know
[9187.08 --> 9196.04]  there's a ton of examples of that it like here i mean we we don't need a pro uh this is i'm i'm
[9196.04 --> 9201.24]  slightly copping out by saying we can just do this ourselves instead of using external service
[9201.80 --> 9207.80]  so a series of professionals maybe i was gonna say nice like oh we can do that that was crazy that's
[9207.80 --> 9214.04]  stupid that's probably one of the most brutal ones we've ever done yeah i mean we did it it's working
[9214.04 --> 9221.48]  it's but like like my goodness it literally is like a multi-million dollar a year success
[9222.44 --> 9228.28]  multi-platform at this point yeah like it's working it's just it powers us sauce plus a lot of other
[9228.28 --> 9235.24]  creators on float plane like i don't know man i it kind we kind of you know yeah yeah you kind of did it
[9235.24 --> 9240.84]  it has cool future plans the team's kind of amazing whatnot and we're figuring it out it also forced us to
[9240.84 --> 9245.56]  finally have a dev team yeah which is cool who has done all kinds of other cool stuff
[9246.84 --> 9252.68]  like i don't know sometimes i really like working on full plane stuff our whole like i just do feels
[9252.68 --> 9259.00]  like home i feel like we kind of fail upward a lot you know you know you know what i mean right like
[9259.56 --> 9265.08]  not in the way that that normally is meant right like failing upwards is when you're like incompetent and
[9265.08 --> 9270.44]  you get kind of pushed out but into like a higher position like like kind of like a nepotism sort of
[9270.44 --> 9278.12]  connotation like we but we've just managed to screw up our way to the top but like like it actually
[9278.12 --> 9285.24]  worked like it didn't fail yeah but it should have yeah it was just way harder than it needed to be that
[9285.24 --> 9291.24]  was most of it decision making failure i had a yeah i had a lot of conversations with people where
[9291.24 --> 9297.08]  it would start as like you shouldn't do this because you can't and then it would end up being
[9297.08 --> 9306.20]  like okay fine you can but like why yeah i didn't listen to that part yeah i just listened to the you
[9306.20 --> 9318.52]  can't yeah no we can't uh oh well um yeah did you figure your thing out yeah yeah damn
[9321.16 --> 9328.52]  i rode okay no wait not yet so i rode in a couple of cars so one of them was part of the huawei demo at
[9328.52 --> 9335.00]  their like flagship store which includes everything if i was asked to design a store to showcase everything
[9335.00 --> 9340.20]  from like wearables to tvs to automobiles i wouldn't even know where to start but honestly
[9340.20 --> 9345.24]  they kind of nailed it so they they had some cars that had like partner technologies in their showroom
[9345.24 --> 9352.60]  so we went went a test drive in one and it's got you know voice activation this and uh assisted driving
[9352.60 --> 9361.48]  whatever that and like you know it's like kind of cool um but this one the one that they used to drive
[9361.48 --> 9366.28]  us between the locations where they were just like showing off huawei technology integrations and
[9366.28 --> 9376.44]  vehicles absolutely blew my mind and i agree with ford ceo um we're cooked over here we're cooked check
[9376.44 --> 9383.64]  this out first one yeah so this is me and charad in the back of a whatever this is i actually can't
[9383.64 --> 9390.60]  remember what the model name is so that's embarrassing um we have a starry night sky thing above us sure um
[9391.48 --> 9399.40]  in the in the next two oh uh by charade's elbow okay so you can see all the seat adjustments in there
[9399.88 --> 9408.12]  and then right next to that each seat has a little like pop-out phone like device that you can use to
[9408.12 --> 9416.04]  control the various functions in the car including the heating cooling of your seat um the heat the
[9416.04 --> 9421.88]  temperature of the fridge that's between us so there's a there's a little like fridge that could
[9421.88 --> 9427.88]  hold maybe like a wine bottle or a couple of other drinks in between us where that that like kleenex thing
[9427.88 --> 9439.00]  is um okay now are you a little impressed uh yeah but it just looks like an expensive back of a car
[9439.00 --> 9447.96]  all right hit him with the next one wow so you could mod that in but that's that's uh
[9449.00 --> 9459.24]  it's very pimp my ride so in between our heads is a projector and you press a button that lowers
[9459.24 --> 9467.32]  a projector screen yeah the windows uh what what's it called electro chromatic leg room is this a really
[9467.32 --> 9473.08]  long car it's it's it's meant to be it's it's the kind of car you're meant to be passenger vehicle
[9473.08 --> 9477.48]  for it in or whatever those called yeah yeah so it's it's kind of competing with like you know the
[9477.48 --> 9485.40]  the roles the maybok um exactly and um okay sorry what what was i saying oh right right right so the
[9485.40 --> 9492.20]  so the projector screen comes down there is a camera you can see there's a webcam up at the top of the
[9492.20 --> 9498.44]  projector screen so you can like take a conference call it's good uh look i mean sure but also you
[9498.44 --> 9504.84]  know so you can take a conference call you know um and and have all the other all the other meeting
[9504.84 --> 9511.96]  attendees on the projector screen yeah the windows are uh i believe they are what's it called uh
[9511.96 --> 9518.28]  electro chromatic electrochromic electrochromic yeah and they have like a filter that that comes up so
[9518.28 --> 9523.64]  they have like a sunshade that comes up to make it actually quite dark in the back uh there's
[9523.64 --> 9528.84]  wireless charging in between our in the armrest there's two little slips where you can slip your
[9528.84 --> 9534.60]  phone into right by that piece of paper nice i see that uh charade was joking really all these features
[9534.60 --> 9541.00]  and no cup holder retractable cup holder that's um under where the charging is so you kind of hit a
[9541.00 --> 9547.56]  button and then it pops out in between us the seats fully recline and adjust oh they have massage
[9547.56 --> 9553.56]  in addition to heat and cooling and one of the really wild features okay you can go back to uh
[9553.56 --> 9560.36]  you can go back to us is it includes a privacy mode so that the passengers in the front can't hear you or
[9560.36 --> 9565.88]  the front passenger and the driver can't hear you and we were like okay well that's stupid there's no way
[9565.88 --> 9571.40]  that works um and then charade pressed it and it turns out that it doesn't just try to like anc
[9571.40 --> 9578.20]  what you're saying because that would be we don't have that technology yet um what it does is it
[9579.40 --> 9587.48]  adds like an echo loop and a bunch of sort of noise it it like it's it sort of salts the data so to
[9587.48 --> 9595.40]  speak um while probably also doing the anc stuff yeah yeah yeah um i didn't actually try sitting in the
[9595.40 --> 9601.80]  front unfortunately i didn't really get a chance but pretty pretty wild now was it this thing
[9603.32 --> 9607.88]  oh yeah that's it yeah yeah so nokie found it hold on hold on hold on hold on don't don't look too
[9607.88 --> 9613.64]  don't look too closely yet i want you to okay i want you to guess i want you to guess what it costs
[9613.64 --> 9619.48]  it's oh i stopped it from being there but it's still on my screen uh hold on hold on okay first first of all
[9619.48 --> 9627.72]  all so like what does uh what does this roll z like what's a ghost cost okay i 400k is my guess
[9628.76 --> 9636.60]  uh 600k yeah if you don't if you don't customize anything the options blah blah currency are we
[9636.60 --> 9642.92]  talking commission you don't buy you don't buy a ghost you commission a ghost so i actually don't
[9642.92 --> 9649.80]  remember how much they cost oh yes uh do they have do they even have a starting price for crying out
[9649.80 --> 9655.32]  loud make an inquiry okay forget it the point is probably about half a million dollars by the time
[9655.32 --> 9660.92]  you actually like do anything is the ghost the expensive one i don't even think that's their top
[9660.92 --> 9666.20]  of the line though that's like their that's like their kind of their workhorse is my understanding i
[9666.20 --> 9672.76]  don't i don't know their lineup extremely well i've never bought a rolls sorry uh
[9672.76 --> 9680.92]  uh lowest possible is like 355 okay from what i'm seeing but it can go a lot higher is the phantom
[9680.92 --> 9687.40]  their starter i actually can't remember the peasant spying ghost yeah i'm actually not sure i think the
[9687.40 --> 9695.80]  cullinan is higher end that's the suv right yeah uh i don't know what the specter is yeah i can't
[9695.80 --> 9705.00]  remember okay anyway anyway how much do you think the mike stroh costs 80k
[9707.40 --> 9715.32]  okay why did you why would you guess that i don't know uh i didn't look it up i don't i'm assuming i'm
[9715.32 --> 9720.28]  not correct no you're not right but yeah i'm just wondering why you would guess 80 000 like what what
[9720.28 --> 9727.64]  else could you buy for 80 000 it's it's like cheaper than the high-end teslas but more expensive
[9727.64 --> 9734.20]  than like i don't know other stuff starts at about 100k okay uh but we're still
[9736.12 --> 9742.92]  it's an ev so it comes with like batteries which are a cost that you know a gasoline competitor
[9742.92 --> 9749.16]  doesn't have to deal with yep um so you you never have to put gas in it it is
[9750.84 --> 9756.68]  like you're sitting on a couch basically in the back of it it's crazy i did i think i told you uh
[9756.68 --> 9763.48]  when i was in china i got chauffeured around one time in the back of a maybach and i had the same
[9763.48 --> 9770.60]  feeling i sat in that chair and was just like what the heck it's weird it feels uh almost uncanny it's
[9770.60 --> 9781.56]  like this isn't a car what am i in right now so the price range is 100 to 140 for this and look i'll
[9781.56 --> 9787.08]  be honest with you guys i've never even sat in a ghost i've never i've never sat in a rolls royce
[9787.64 --> 9794.12]  but to my ignorant you know unrefined buttock yes um
[9794.12 --> 9799.88]  i'm i'm looking at this i'm looking at this thing going
[9801.80 --> 9807.88]  how is it realistically going to get way beyond yeah this thing yeah like this would be this would
[9807.88 --> 9813.00]  be the pinnacle of luxury to most some of these pictures are nuts yeah here let's see
[9816.28 --> 9822.60]  this is the uh the mike strew or whatever yeah i mean you can just zoom your browser just to give it
[9822.60 --> 9831.72]  the old two finger you know what i'm saying oh yeah did i oh yeah did i mention the starry sky in
[9831.72 --> 9838.76]  it can has like different modes it can twinkle it can do shooting stars um the starry sky feels like a
[9838.76 --> 9848.76]  rip bit of a rip huge huge screens it's something that people do in rolls as though that's why that's
[9848.76 --> 9855.88]  what i'm saying i think it's a rip oh a rip off oh 100 oh 100 are those speakers in the yeah those
[9855.88 --> 9861.72]  speakers in the chair why not like it's it's loaded for bear man
[9864.44 --> 9864.76]  wow
[9867.48 --> 9873.24]  is this is this like the seat in front of them is gone oh no it folds down yeah okay yeah
[9873.24 --> 9880.12]  that's why so you can get extremely comfy is this this is someone's phone or is this the
[9880.12 --> 9882.76]  tablet thing you're talking that's the little tablet controller thing yeah
[9884.60 --> 9890.84]  it's pretty wild dude oh yeah it has the airplane table uh fold out thing i forgot about that no no on
[9890.84 --> 9896.76]  the left oh yeah yeah so you have a little table at both of the back seats laptop or whatever yep or you
[9896.76 --> 9902.68]  can eat or your swishky trunk yep trunk
[9907.00 --> 9907.72]  what is this
[9910.44 --> 9912.36]  i think they're trying to show matrix headlamps
[9915.56 --> 9916.60]  no i don't think so
[9920.52 --> 9921.00]  interesting
[9924.36 --> 9924.60]  yeah
[9926.76 --> 9928.60]  huh
[9928.60 --> 9931.96]  uh it's available in multiple options oh okay yep
[9933.72 --> 9942.68]  all right anyway very interesting yeah it's uh i i had i i had been you know reading about
[9942.68 --> 9951.48]  following from a distance so that or a cyber truck right like seriously though yeah i i don't think that
[9951.48 --> 9957.00]  would make an insane splash i don't think that would make as insane of a splash in the north
[9957.00 --> 9963.88]  american market that people might think um they're gonna need a good truck oh yeah apparently byd's
[9963.88 --> 9969.88]  truck is like 35k or something like that um see like that might make a bigger splash because you've
[9969.88 --> 9974.92]  you got to fight the f-150 there's no like there's no ignoring the f-150 and trying to enter
[9974.92 --> 9977.00]  the north american market heck no so
[9978.12 --> 9982.68]  yeah and that's still gonna be it's byd so i'm assuming that's an electric truck still
[9983.16 --> 9990.04]  uh i think it's a hybrid yeah it's it's no good 63 says their ford ranger size pickup with a one
[9990.04 --> 9995.08]  cylinder allows up to 500 miles of range and is 35 000 us dollars
[9995.08 --> 10002.52]  yeah um see that'll be that's a more interesting fight in my opinion yep um opcode says how does it
[10002.52 --> 10010.04]  compare to your take hand in terms of quality it's a very different car um like it's not it's not
[10010.04 --> 10017.88]  intended to compete with the taikan loading couch yeah um whisks you from location to location the taikan
[10017.88 --> 10024.84]  is meant to be driven whereas the mike stro is intended to be driven around in right so it's
[10024.84 --> 10031.88]  it's totally different the maestro's a snuggie and the taikan's like a a running shoe yeah um terrible
[10031.88 --> 10037.32]  analogies in terms of like like the fit and finish of it though i'll be honest with you i didn't look
[10037.32 --> 10043.40]  that closely because i was too busy being impressed by the sum of the parts rather than the individual
[10043.40 --> 10047.64]  parts sure um if we were doing like a full review or something like that that would be a different
[10047.64 --> 10054.76]  story but nothing stood out to me as being junky i can tell you that much for sure um oh shoot i
[10054.76 --> 10059.16]  have to go pretty quick because i have to take my kids um surprised you're still here uh trick-or-treating
[10059.16 --> 10063.56]  no no i'm i'm good are we done the topics we're done the topics we're done the topics we haven't
[10063.56 --> 10071.80]  done sp announcement merch massages our most successful float plane video ever was when lmg employees shared
[10071.80 --> 10082.28]  their first memories of meeting me oh wow yep that's a pretty strong like dislike ratio um so we made a
[10082.28 --> 10090.84]  sequel featuring yvonne colton and ploof who owns a display and more oh and yes there will be a video
[10090.84 --> 10095.08]  of me reacting to the sequel in november oh good i haven't done that yet but apparently we're going to be
[10095.08 --> 10103.16]  doing that so get some laughs and maybe a little bit of secondhand embarrassment at lmg.gg floatplane
[10103.16 --> 10108.20]  excellent all right dan should we do a couple merch messages yeah that sounds good to me hit me sure
[10108.20 --> 10117.96]  uh let's see why does it seem like every tech tuber praises the 9070-9070 xt on camera and fsr4 yada yada
[10117.96 --> 10125.88]  but off camera they're all running nvidia gpus feels like a bit of do as i say not as i do i i'm
[10125.88 --> 10133.72]  running a 7900 xtx let the record show so i don't know in my opinion when praise is happening they're
[10133.72 --> 10138.60]  often probably talking about price performance and then they can have whatever they want so they take
[10138.60 --> 10144.28]  the performance and do not care about the price that's the answer that's that's the real answer
[10144.28 --> 10151.24]  the only reason i'm running a 7900 xtx is because i committed to skipping the 40 series
[10153.24 --> 10161.88]  and otherwise i would have just run a 4090. greetings dll linus with the canadian post strike
[10161.88 --> 10167.48]  why does creator warehouse still ship to po boxes when the ltd store site says to avoid them i use my
[10167.48 --> 10175.48]  street address but the merch still comes canada post wow what a tremendous question for creator
[10175.48 --> 10181.88]  warehouse customer service i i think you should send them a message and maybe they can explain that
[10181.88 --> 10190.36]  i have no idea i want to shout out our amazing cw team uh tony and dave and adam and the rest of the
[10190.36 --> 10197.56]  customer care team and taryn and everyone who has worked really hard on you know resolving the
[10197.56 --> 10202.36]  challenging logistics situation that has taken place this year we've had to deal with tariffs
[10202.36 --> 10207.64]  from our southern neighbors we've had to deal with tariffs from our manufacturing neighbors we've had
[10207.64 --> 10212.44]  to deal with flipping the strike from canada post we've had a lot of times i think we've had a lot of
[10212.44 --> 10218.44]  on our plate this year and our team has done an amazing job of figuring out how to get your thing to
[10218.44 --> 10222.52]  you and shout out them and if you want the specifics you'll have to ask them because they're the experts
[10224.60 --> 10230.76]  what an answer good answer i've been doing this for a little bit professional what a guy this one i
[10230.76 --> 10237.48]  wasn't too sure about maybe you could help me parse it started an re photo comp with a few family members
[10237.48 --> 10244.04]  and have hit 30 in revenue and we are trying to learn to scale fast and trying to figure out the best
[10244.04 --> 10253.48]  route such as pacing ourselves or just spamming the phone thanks a photo comp photo competition
[10254.52 --> 10264.12]  few family members re i'm not sure 30 in rev 30k i'm assuming so maybe they're hosting a competition
[10264.12 --> 10268.60]  maybe you have to pay to enter the competition spamming the phone that i don't know
[10268.60 --> 10278.20]  okay nobody else understands what they're talking about what is re photo comp started a re photo comp
[10283.32 --> 10290.52]  next okay yeah sorry i was struggling genuinely tried hey dll question for linus how's the new winter
[10290.52 --> 10299.48]  jacket coming along real estate photo company oh oh my god i i real estate no no no no no no imperator
[10299.48 --> 10304.36]  in full plane chat said real estate that makes so much more sense real estate photo company they hit 30
[10304.36 --> 10309.32]  k in revenue they something something or just spamming photos on a phone what was the other thing they
[10309.32 --> 10314.20]  were saying hitting the phone i think they were looking how to scale fast right they wanted to scale up
[10314.20 --> 10319.40]  and they weren't sure how to do that without just like hitting the phone which is probably more like
[10319.40 --> 10326.36]  cold calling pacing ourselves or just spamming the phone spamming the phone cold calling he's probably
[10326.36 --> 10332.68]  right my yeah this is uh yeah i mean it's gonna be all networking in that industry like it's all old
[10332.68 --> 10339.32]  boys club so to speak um so you definitely want to make connections and everything else is is kind of
[10339.32 --> 10343.16]  secondary honestly as someone who's looked through real estate listings
[10345.56 --> 10352.44]  man are most their photos terrible yeah learn how to do hdr better than like 90 of everybody and
[10352.44 --> 10357.56]  you're fine there's some actually really good it's not a high bar there is a lot of really good youtube
[10357.56 --> 10362.92]  tutorials but if you've already got 30k in revenue you're fine you know what you're doing yeah keep it up
[10362.92 --> 10371.00]  congrats on on on growing it at a staging company keep it up yeah staging is makes such a big difference
[10371.00 --> 10376.60]  or do um okay so yeah probably but a bunch of people are doing uh people aren't gonna like this
[10376.60 --> 10383.08]  but like uh ai staging stuff lately it is actually very surprisingly good because you can see the photo
[10383.08 --> 10389.00]  of the room empty and the photo of the room with stuff in it and it's cool being able to see that idea
[10389.00 --> 10399.08]  um new winter jacket uh oh okay you'll have to do another one while i look that up um
[10402.20 --> 10407.80]  hi wanda dl are you aware of the development of 3d printed medication and the potential for
[10407.80 --> 10412.76]  multiple prescriptions to be combined into one pill and do you have thoughts about it that's cool i
[10412.76 --> 10418.04]  haven't heard of that how does that make any sense why would you 3d print them yeah well maybe because
[10418.04 --> 10422.36]  you want like different release schedules or whatever because like you know they can have
[10422.36 --> 10426.28]  different coatings and they can have different like capsules and stuff that release at different
[10426.28 --> 10432.12]  times but why would you want to 3d print that i don't know maybe it's more maybe it's like helps
[10432.12 --> 10438.04]  that the complexity how do you ensure they're mixed properly i don't know i don't know i'm not a
[10438.04 --> 10446.20]  doctor i'm just saying i like 3d printing hmm don't wait really someone needs to clip that we need to
[10446.20 --> 10449.72]  clip that dan we need that clip he knows what i mean
[10453.88 --> 10461.96]  i was in a couple time stamps uh thermochromic jacket is expected to hit in november
[10463.48 --> 10469.80]  so soon but i don't want to nail down an exact week because things happen sometimes nice but that's
[10469.80 --> 10478.28]  when it's expected hi lld looking for advice moving to rural australia for work in the next 25 52 weeks
[10478.76 --> 10486.12]  uh steam deck versus xbox ally versus laptop reviews seem to indicate ally x is undercooked my friends
[10486.12 --> 10496.60]  use xbox online oh i mean but these are all pcs the steam deck with xbox online question mark crossplay
[10496.60 --> 10505.48]  um i mean the laptop if you can only have one the laptop has the most utility if you can get one that
[10505.48 --> 10510.52]  supports a oh i don't think this one supports it but like like a tent mode you know where it folds the
[10510.52 --> 10516.60]  other way and you can just put it like this but with the screen on the outside it's very nice on a thing
[10516.60 --> 10521.48]  with a controller that's pretty sick like if you can only have one i'd want the one that has a keyboard
[10521.48 --> 10526.68]  um i'm also personally leaning laptop but i i didn't answer right away because i don't have either
[10526.68 --> 10535.64]  of the other ones so i'm a little bit biased here um yeah and i don't know how much like a strix halo
[10535.64 --> 10542.84]  laptop costs this this hp1 my understanding is it's pretty pretty expensive
[10542.84 --> 10553.24]  it is true like the the steam deck is going to be by far the cheapest option like one of the issues
[10553.24 --> 10559.88]  with this question is you're asking an insane variety in price yeah i i mean the steam deck is
[10559.88 --> 10565.72]  the best bang for the buck that's the easiest one to recommend but as for the ally xbox ally x whatever
[10565.72 --> 10571.00]  whatever the stupid thing is called so do you need to do more stuff on it it's it's it's it's pretty
[10571.00 --> 10577.56]  good like i i don't know what to tell you it's um i think people are just frustrated because microsoft
[10577.56 --> 10584.20]  sold it as something that it wasn't but as a as a small computer that's pretty d's it's great yeah
[10585.40 --> 10592.20]  that's not less a question but maybe more of a general question my work has a stupid new no graphic
[10592.20 --> 10598.28]  tease policy but text isn't banned please make a shirt that says shirt in giant text on it
[10598.28 --> 10604.84]  how does that fit in with like your branding or your like is that something that you would ever do
[10604.84 --> 10609.32]  or do you want to make like cool stuff because like shirt that says shirt and giant
[10609.88 --> 10613.96]  text is like kind of my aesthetic in a way i love that type of stuff
[10617.88 --> 10621.48]  i've been pondering i mean do enough of you want this like is that a thing
[10621.48 --> 10628.84]  i figured yeah can you make ascii images that's just text see that that sort of tickles my malicious
[10628.84 --> 10633.40]  compliance but that's fantastic a lot more than the other one does it kind of made me think of uh
[10633.40 --> 10638.36]  the the no-name brand like merch products that they do i'll tell you what we'll do the ascii one
[10638.84 --> 10644.44]  ascii that's a way better idea i like an ascii art shirt oh yeah thanks amaria that sounds like a great
[10644.44 --> 10650.92]  okay uh um who do i send this to okay i'll the next time we do a linux challenge we should both be required
[10650.92 --> 10661.16]  to uh make a cool little you know can i use the term
[10663.40 --> 10667.32]  to rice it out in a really cool way that is the official term that is what people call it i'm just
[10667.32 --> 10673.40]  saying sure we'll go with that and there is cool stuff that they do with ascii art in that process
[10673.40 --> 10679.80]  and we should we should do that that should be part of it whatever leave me alone i don't know what
[10679.80 --> 10687.80]  else to call it modify yeah but that doesn't that's not that doesn't encapsulate the that's true
[10687.80 --> 10694.04]  whatever whatever you've been waiting for a turn yeah um i have been waiting so long for this to
[10694.04 --> 10700.60]  come back they have bought the northern lights t-shirt tall hell yeah thank you for doing tall
[10700.60 --> 10705.56]  graphics is this our first tall graphic it seems to be and it's like five of them or something it's
[10705.56 --> 10711.72]  actually very exciting i need to order them immediately yeah me too i've been waiting so
[10711.72 --> 10716.92]  long for this to come back what is the oldest used hardware you'd recommend picking up right now
[10717.88 --> 10723.80]  oh man it depends on what you're trying to do i mean i it's so open-ended yeah i i i my uncle
[10723.80 --> 10735.16]  needed a needed a laptop with a cd-rom drive in it and so uh we just grabbed some like like vista machine
[10735.56 --> 10741.24]  and it will never be connected to a network so it doesn't matter because it's for like loading
[10741.88 --> 10749.16]  data from some cd resource into some computer and it has to like live there because it has to be used
[10749.16 --> 10754.60]  periodically and connected to that thing and it's just like well that's the oldest hardware that i'd
[10754.60 --> 10759.88]  recommend for that like it it just depends on what you're trying to do running a windows xp machine
[10759.88 --> 10764.68]  today if it was completely offline it's totally fine tons of them still work that way in terms of
[10764.68 --> 10768.28]  workshops and stuff what i would actually connect to the internet i would want something that is
[10768.28 --> 10772.52]  modern enough to run an operating system that's still getting updates if it's windows that means
[10772.52 --> 10783.00]  not that old but if it's linux go ham nice dynas duke and lan do sponsors pay extra for riley to do
[10783.00 --> 10786.92]  his amazing singing ad spots or does he do them just because he can yes
[10786.92 --> 10795.80]  both of those things uh he's kind of uh been a bit of a spiritual successor for what dennis was doing
[10795.80 --> 10802.52]  with what we call csps or creative sponsor placements or something like that i forget what it's short for
[10802.52 --> 10809.24]  but um it was csr so creative sponsor reads but then i was like that sounds too close to customer service
[10809.24 --> 10812.36]  representative and i'm never going to know what you're talking about so we changed it to csp
[10812.36 --> 10819.00]  and um it is something that sponsors can pay extra for and we do show them hey there's increased
[10819.00 --> 10824.84]  retention there's increased um click through like there's all these benefits you should probably do
[10824.84 --> 10831.08]  this i have had two merch messages this evening asking for a compilation i i could see that being
[10831.08 --> 10837.72]  something we might do on the clips channel at some point but yeah i know he's been killing it um
[10838.28 --> 10846.28]  cannot say enough how impressed i have been with riley's work on that i am dude it's not just riley
[10846.28 --> 10851.40]  it's a team effort it's not just riley they have to be they have to be shot and edited and stuff but
[10851.40 --> 10859.16]  like massive shout out to the team yeah so it's been nuts yeah last one i got for you today good
[10859.16 --> 10864.52]  evening linus luke and dan what wireless technology do you think might compete or replace bluetooth do you
[10864.52 --> 10871.72]  think rf headphones would ever make a comeback what happened to li-fi oh i don't know man i mean
[10871.72 --> 10877.32]  there's only so much spectrum like it's one of those things where it's like man what new continents
[10877.32 --> 10882.92]  do you think we could discover you know over the last thousand years we've just western civilization
[10882.92 --> 10890.12]  has discovered a continent at approximately a rate of one every 200 years you know well like yeah okay
[10890.12 --> 10901.24]  but there's um here's a really controversial take sure modern btle pretty good yeah there's more that
[10901.24 --> 10907.56]  could be done for user friendliness but like even then why can't i have multi-channel with good audio
[10907.56 --> 10915.72]  and a mic at the same time in current year i am upset i agree with that do better but it's still
[10915.72 --> 10921.32]  bluetooth you could just make bluetooth less garbage yeah and they are dual stream like bluetooth is
[10921.32 --> 10927.72]  continuing to get betterer and i mean as far as i can tell the the major constraint is just that we
[10927.72 --> 10934.92]  all want it to be cheap yeah if you could do 2.4 gigahertz communication expensively well it would be
[10934.92 --> 10940.60]  better look at all the 2.4 gigahertz dongles that exist that are like better than bluetooth but we want it
[10940.60 --> 10946.36]  to be low power we want it to be cheap and we want it to have good range and we wanted to have
[10946.92 --> 10952.52]  a wide data path and we wanted to have all these things and it's like well look in the real world
[10952.52 --> 10960.44]  you don't get everything so wait i think it i think it will continue to get better as for li-fi
[10960.44 --> 10964.28]  that's a good question i would love to know what happened to li-fi and i was lying there's one more
[10964.28 --> 10969.24]  linus you mentioned you still occasionally play halo infinite do you prefer 4v4 modes or big team battle
[10969.24 --> 10975.80]  halo isn't halo to me without vehicles and at least eight versus eight i generally play 4v4 i um
[10975.80 --> 10979.40]  i find big team battle a little too chaotic for my boomer brain
[10981.64 --> 10984.76]  and so sorry my apologies
[10984.76 --> 10997.64]  thanks for tuning into the land show we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[10998.52 --> 11003.32]  i would have just stayed there i i know i would have waited i know i gotta go though he gave up early
[11003.32 --> 11013.88]  oh yeah bye
[11017.72 --> 11029.88]  who knows
