[0.00 → 6.92] you all ladies and gentlemen welcome to the WAN show we have a terrible show lined up for you
[6.92 → 12.80] this week we have nothing so it'll be a great show that's how it works yeah I know it only
[12.80 → 19.20] seems to work out that way yeah the big topic that is enveloping the ecosphere this week
[19.20 → 25.40] is obviously GeForce cables melting to the melting so we'll be talking about what's
[25.40 → 32.16] going on with RTX 5090 cables including I think uh someone on our team threw it in the ct scanner
[32.16 → 38.06] so we could have a look at what some folks are talking about out there with the PCB design and
[38.06 → 45.96] the shunts and all of that uh what else we got this week we're um I called the guy I call I called the
[45.96 → 50.26] guy and if you're not a regular viewer you're going to have no idea what I'm talking about but if you are
[50.26 → 55.00] a regular viewer you're going to be pretty excited the guy has been called what else we got this week
[55.00 → 60.62] total copied our verify- verified actual gamer program which if you're new here is actually
[60.62 → 65.34] pretty old at this point yeah I know right which is kind of weird 30 series to even think about but
[65.34 → 76.08] still and uh steam distributed malware ooh sure oh like four people
[85.00 → 99.64] the show is brought to you today by oh do odd pieces and corsair and of course by our rap partner
[99.64 → 106.20] brand and our chair partner secret lab they really don't do a good job of living up to their name
[106.20 → 111.46] secret lab you can't really be a secret very public well if you're advertising all the time yeah yeah
[111.46 → 119.20] bad job secret lab well marketed lab speaking of bad job let's jump right into our first topic today
[119.20 → 126.86] GeForce cables melting to the melting here's a bit of a recap from last time from GeForce cables
[126.86 → 135.88] melting one the new hope and I don't know when the 4090 launched we saw lots of reports of cables
[135.88 → 141.46] melting NVIDIA their story pretty much boiled down to it being user error either people
[141.46 → 147.86] seating the cable incorrectly or installing poorly constructed third-party cables part of the issue was
[147.86 → 153.06] that to get their fancy new connector to fit in a lot of cases with the way that it stuck out
[153.06 → 157.84] directly off the top of the card the cable ended up pressed against the side panel straining the
[157.84 → 164.86] connection now cable mod made some 90 degree adapters that people hoped would fix the problem but
[164.86 → 173.16] long story short they didn't and cable mod ultimately recalled said product a newer 4090 models attempt to
[173.16 → 180.08] solve the issue by repositioning the 16 pin power connector also the 12 volt high power cable design was
[180.08 → 188.36] updated to 12 volt 2 by 6 for 2025 it has shorter sense pins and longer conductor terminals to help ensure
[188.36 → 194.94] that all the power uh excuse me all the power carrying cables are all the way in before the sense pins will
[194.94 → 203.32] say hey yeah we've got a connection corsair currently has at least six blog posts about 12 volt 2 by 6 or 12 volts high
[203.32 → 210.62] power which adapter you should use and how to connect cables to your power supply now I'm going to take a moment
[210.62 → 217.10] here and go off the sort of notes provided to us and say hey if something's this complicated
[217.10 → 226.76] um is the problem maybe you and not me anyway no, no sorry, sorry I digress um reports of more failures
[226.76 → 234.00] with the 4090 and adapters continue to pop up all the way into 2025 pc gamer ran an article in April last
[234.00 → 240.16] year stating that one repair shop in the la area saw about 200 cards and adapters with melted connectors
[240.16 → 246.34] over a one-month period and Tom's hardware ran an article yesterday called the dark side of gaming
[246.34 → 253.30] finding that their two-year-old cards connector had been melting despite no obvious performance issues
[253.30 → 264.68] now it's time to fast-forward to um a day after yesterday, and it's time to talk about the 5090
[264.68 → 274.38] we are now seeing more reports of cables melting Reddit user Ivan 6953 made a post a few days ago
[274.38 → 280.60] showing melting on both ends of the connector Ivan claims that it was securely fastened and clicked
[280.60 → 286.50] and that he was using an older mod DIY third-party cable mod DIY has released a statement that you
[286.50 → 294.62] should upgrade to the latest 12 volt 2x6 cables for RTX 50 series cards YouTuber too Tokyo Tokyo too
[294.62 → 300.56] Tokyo let's go with that reviews released a video on February 9th claiming that the wiring burned due to
[300.56 → 305.28] a bad connection because of wear on the 12 volt high power connector states that the power supply was
[305.28 → 313.34] very used their Bauer has tested one founder's edition cards as a 5090 with one corsair cable and
[313.34 → 319.46] says that there was uneven current distribution across each pin and this is where things start to
[319.46 → 329.58] get a little bit complicated yeah um and where things start to get a little bit of drama e so the
[329.58 → 339.50] connectors rated for 9.5 amps per power pin and one amp per signal pin okay the Bauer saw readings over
[339.50 → 348.50] 9.5 amps in fact in his first video he saw over 20 amps on one wire then johnny guru who works at
[348.50 → 353.46] corsair and used to be kind of the power supply reviewing guy back before I worked at corsair
[353.46 → 361.88] said that was impossible in der Bauer's second video he said I will show you what is possible
[361.88 → 370.52] and cut four wires while the card was under load measuring about 50 amps between the remaining two
[370.52 → 376.48] wires demonstrating that while that is not in fact something that you should do and is not
[376.48 → 386.46] representative of a real world situation hopefully um that it can in fact run more than 9.5 amps over
[386.46 → 393.44] one wire um he said that it still worked because the sensing pins only check to see if the sensing
[393.44 → 397.52] pins are plugged in and if they are the card will try to draw whatever power it's supposed to
[397.52 → 403.32] it doesn't check how many power pins are connected, and you can see that about 12 minutes into his video
[403.32 → 406.78] if you check for yourself uh Dan do you want to throw that in the various chats it's the one that's
[406.78 → 407.94] hyperlinked in our notes here
[407.94 → 415.34] he then plugged in a new undamaged 12 volt high power cable from corsair and the load was distributed
[415.34 → 423.28] evenly so what he has kind of shown kind of validates what some others have said and that is that this
[423.28 → 430.16] might just come down to bad cables but what he has also shown is that there's still a problem
[430.16 → 435.02] because you can't guarantee one quick set yeah did you say that he cut the cables while it was
[435.02 → 440.88] under load that's what my notes say uh people are saying that it was sorry he cut the four wires
[440.88 → 444.90] and then sorry, sorry no, no not while it was not while it was actually on that would be crazy
[444.90 → 449.38] let's let's back up a bit he cut the four wires and then measured the remaining two wires with a
[449.38 → 455.32] current clamp while it was under load sorry sorry sorry all right cool good um so he's
[455.32 → 461.06] demonstrated two things one that the issue could very well be you know bad cables not necessarily bad
[461.06 → 469.34] cards but also that it seems to go a little bit deeper than that because if a card that is good
[469.34 → 475.46] can't tell that a cable's bad well that could be an issue couldn't it
[475.46 → 484.12] so this is where the plot thickens Roman goes on to say this is debater Roman that this wasn't a
[484.12 → 489.96] problem on the 3090 ti because it had monitoring and load balancing built in to its power delivery design
[489.96 → 497.76] while 40 and 50 series cards do not more on this from Guildford later um some others have sort of
[497.76 → 502.00] weighed in falcon northwest are adamant they haven't seen any issues in the systems they've been building
[502.00 → 507.60] and testing with similar equipment but according to Guildford with the 30 series there were three
[507.60 → 512.94] shunt resistors and three power phases similar to how a three by eight pin system would work
[512.94 → 522.86] while with the 4090 and 5090 they only have two shunt resistors and one power phase so the way to kind of
[522.86 → 534.56] um explain this is that the 5090 has no way of knowing or monitoring which of the 12 volt cables that are
[534.56 → 541.32] plugged into it is actually bringing the power into the board they all just they all just join on the board
[541.32 → 548.62] so all it knows is hey I'm getting power, and you might think okay well a simple solution to this
[548.62 → 553.44] would be for NVIDIA to put some kind of thermal probe on the connector side of the card but the
[553.44 → 559.92] problem is that these are toasty cards you'd be getting so much heat off of the GPU and the
[559.92 → 566.12] memory and the arms that could potentially you know tell those thermal probes' oh yeah everything's you
[566.12 → 571.48] running really hot that they wouldn't be able to tell if it's because the cable that's plugged right
[571.48 → 576.64] into it is on the verge of melting or if it's just that the card runs pretty freaking hot because
[576.64 → 577.70] it's a 5090
[577.70 → 589.28] yeah um I don't know do we have our ct scanner time oh okay hold on a second
[589.28 → 596.70] uh blah blah blah NVIDIA for their part I did reach out uh NVIDIA has said well here's a situation
[596.70 → 602.84] we don't I'm paraphrasing here because this is not like official, but they're basically like we don't
[602.84 → 608.18] have any of these cards back, yet we need them back so that we can do failure analysis on them and that's
[608.18 → 617.20] fair enough um but I am sort of worried for NVIDIA's sake here that when they get them back what
[617.20 → 624.68] they're going to find is that if someone plugs in a defective or poorly positioned seated
[624.68 → 631.74] cable um that they have not built the appropriate mitigations into this card, and it could continue
[631.74 → 637.76] to be a problem they do say that very few cards have been impacted but that doesn't mean that very
[637.76 → 645.34] few cards will ever be impacted uh okay oh this is awesome so it's ct scanner time uh we ct scanned
[645.34 → 653.50] a 3090 founders edition a 4090 founders edition and a 5090 founders edition below are the scans they
[653.50 → 657.20] will all have a bookmark in the bottom left panel called 12 volt high power connections which will show
[657.20 → 663.08] the connections to the board okay these scans are 10 out of 10 but I took bad screenshots in a Google
[663.08 → 667.78] drive here you can't quite make out PCB components all right so I am seeing these for the first time
[667.78 → 671.94] because they've been working on this in the lead up to wan show uh so good luck everybody
[671.94 → 678.74] oh these are going to take a minute to load so here's a 3090 mine has maybe loaded faster okay
[678.74 → 687.86] let's go over to Luke's screen sick and basically what we're looking at is this one looks like it's
[687.86 → 699.62] split into two groups uh there should be a bookmark a view here front view PCB paper chamber
[699.62 → 703.22] this is the power connectors okay yeah good
[703.22 → 708.66] yeah you want to flip it over
[708.66 → 717.78] traces pads oh here there we go
[717.78 → 723.32] nope yeah I don't think so okay go back to the 12 volt high power
[723.32 → 729.64] okay I got someone chat saying that looks like three shunt resistors to me
[730.60 → 738.92] uh the claim from uh Guildford is that 3090 should have three so I guess that lines up okay, okay
[739.64 → 744.60] all right now let's go to the 4090 have you opened that one already no I'll click it now
[744.60 → 755.32] man I love this ct scanner this is so cool I'm going to preload 5090 perfect okay we're coming back to my screen
[761.56 → 766.84] yeah neat is definitely an understatement it takes a hot minute to load yeah sorry guys
[766.84 → 772.84] uh this is a really rough scan but the pins are separate at least from the connectors what our notes
[772.84 → 783.40] say here that is a pretty rough scan okay there we go where's our okay, okay so this one
[789.40 → 792.52] yeah that is a that is a much rougher scan
[796.84 → 798.84] uh
[800.20 → 804.28] well let's turn our attention to the 5090 because Lucas showed me this one before the show
[807.72 → 813.72] okay um so this is the oh do you want to do mine I have it already yeah yeah go for it
[816.12 → 825.48] so here the issue is that the connections are all just tied together into a single bus so what Lucas was
[825.48 → 833.32] uh was showing me before is that basically all the 12 volt pins just go into a single power plane
[834.28 → 842.28] and all the ground pins just go into a single ground plane so what this means is that the board
[842.28 → 850.20] has no way of knowing which pin is carrying all the power in so if one of them has a poor connection
[850.20 → 857.32] one pin has a poor connection then what will happen is that pin will heat up the more it heats up the
[857.32 → 863.00] higher the resistance goes so the worse the situation gets then you can have the connector start to melt
[863.00 → 869.56] which obviously is not good for the contact of the pins and all the while all the card will see is
[870.12 → 871.32] I am getting power
[876.60 → 876.92] um
[876.92 → 891.00] not good ISA ret in the float plane chat says Linus so if you have common power planes why use a
[891.00 → 898.76] connector that is prone to differential amperage due to resistance well let me tell you
[898.76 → 909.48] um uh you'll have to ask NVIDIA that yeah their board partners don't appear to be doing so uh Guildford's
[909.48 → 918.28] diagram shows that the RTX 4090 matrices and 5090 astral both actually use a different approach that would
[918.28 → 927.40] allow it to detect if one of the pins is carrying too much amperage um this doesn't look great
[927.40 → 934.28] the only defence that I can see for NVIDIA in all of this is that this power connector is technically
[934.28 → 939.32] part of the cm5 industry standard and should be safe at power levels up to 600 watts
[940.20 → 941.72] but here's the thing Luke
[943.56 → 950.52] I remember back when we transitioned to this thing with several people I've had this conversation several times
[950.52 → 952.52] I believe we've also talked about it on wan show
[952.52 → 962.12] with my limited understanding yeah of electrical engineering and electronics engineering yeah what
[962.12 → 971.00] I know both dropouts by the way is that more surface area more the better right when it comes to
[971.00 → 980.04] mating surfaces for an electrical connection sure yeah so why was it that when NVIDIA recognized that they
[980.04 → 987.16] were that we were moving to a point where GPUs were going to require more and more power what possessed
[987.16 → 996.76] them to go for smaller little tiny pins instead of the big pins we had already yeah I don't know I still
[997.56 → 1007.16] don't understand that and I have yet to have anybody explain it to me if we moved say to 24 volts at the same time
[1007.16 → 1014.12] I'd be far less concerned, but we didn't
[1016.44 → 1025.56] so what is what and and and and we and like NVIDIA is the one entity other than okay intel sure intel as
[1025.56 → 1030.20] well NVIDIA and intel are the two entities that can sort of um
[1030.20 → 1039.48] just declare that we are going to use a new connector you know they they they need something
[1039.48 → 1045.40] can still do that historically maybe I mean they are the maintainers of the ATX spec so you know there
[1045.40 → 1053.00] is that okay anyway okay historically then intel and NVIDIA uh to just unilaterally make a decision that
[1053.00 → 1058.68] we're going to use this connector now so they could have decided on any connector they could have
[1058.68 → 1063.08] designed you know with a consortium or with some input from others they could have designed their
[1063.08 → 1069.96] own connector we could have gone with you know uh some variant of the larger older style
[1069.96 → 1076.28] pins that are also used in CPU power connectors EPs ATX 12 volts all those all that stuff uh they could have
[1076.28 → 1081.88] used those same pins and receptacles, and they could have added the sensing wires that are
[1081.88 → 1088.76] actually a pretty cool part of the spec because as long as people don't just jumper them to fool them
[1088.76 → 1093.56] uh theoretically they communicate between the power supply and the GPU so that you don't have a
[1093.56 → 1099.00] mismatch where you've got a starving power uh starving GPU and an inadequate power supply that
[1099.00 → 1105.88] that's the theory behind it but the whole thing where the new connector was you know like
[1105.88 → 1112.44] rated for more than the old connector to my like monkey brain I'm kind of looking at it going
[1113.96 → 1121.40] why yeah why was that why exactly was that when you've got this obvious potential issue here
[1123.56 → 1129.80] um super whisk says why not just have a connector with two giant spades if it's going to be that way on
[1129.80 → 1141.00] the inside yes that kind of um yeah I can't claim to know so much of this is just like it seems
[1141.00 → 1146.36] obvious to me but I don't know a lot about this so I'm assuming there's like gotta be something else
[1146.36 → 1154.84] going on like I bought a bunch of these uh rc lip uh battery connectors I forget what they're called
[1154.84 → 1162.84] uh yeah yeah TXT 60s and XT 90s like if is you're going to design the card like that why don't we just
[1162.84 → 1168.12] why don't we just use these do you think these things are sick very chunky these things are great
[1168.12 → 1174.60] and they like won't yeah yeah j5 says the xt60 connector can do 30 amps at 500 volts yeah why don't
[1174.60 → 1180.04] we just use that because like yeah you're going to have the same issue where if it's not connected properly
[1180.04 → 1185.56] or whatever then you could no you won't have the same issue because you've just got two giant pins
[1186.44 → 1191.16] so you plug in just fine really so you can't have you can't have one pin have a bad connection there's
[1191.16 → 1195.64] a good amount of space separation between those two yeah why don't we just use that and stuff um
[1195.64 → 1201.64] Tammy Hudson says xt60 is used in my solar panels they can carry a lot of power yeahs okay there all
[1201.64 → 1208.68] right there that's the LTT solution we're going to move away from the old PCIE connectors we're going to move
[1208.68 → 1214.20] away from 12 volt high power uh we're going to move away from we're going to move away from all this
[1214.20 → 1220.52] stuff, and we're going to go to xt60s if we're not going to have protections on it anyway then we might as
[1220.52 → 1226.52] well just have a big old I mean look why don't we just go for a kind of cool let's just plug it
[1226.52 → 1231.16] straight into the wall I mean there were tons of memes about that yeah like tons of them especially if
[1231.16 → 1236.20] you can plug that wall outlet in on the back of your computer, and you know when they have these
[1236.20 → 1244.44] uh like you know bridging PCBs like they do on the dual flow through design you could move the
[1244.44 → 1248.76] the plug lower in the case Tynan says you're still in trouble Linus because the current into
[1248.76 → 1256.76] a 5090 is like 50 amps okay Tynan I will see your 50 amps and I will raise you one xt60 connector
[1257.72 → 1263.48] dual xt60 it's almost like we had a solution for this before where you just have multiple connectors if
[1263.48 → 1269.88] you need more current we could also just go to xt90 how many amps can xt90 do hold on XT that thing is
[1269.88 → 1277.64] that thing is chunk that thing's chunk are they safe for ah, ah the rated current is just 40 amps
[1278.36 → 1284.52] um however the response on esk8 forum says I wouldn't worry about drawing more than that
[1285.16 → 1291.24] uh the x10 oh someone else says they're spec'd at 90 amps for the applicable RC power range which is
[1291.24 → 1296.20] generally low voltages of 11 to 24. Okay so why don't we just go why don't we just go to xt90
[1296.20 → 1301.32] what about something like speak on have you seen a peak on connector you're going to have to give me the
[1301.32 → 1310.76] spelling uh speak on one word oh okay sure I think I found it I mean yeah they just twist lock in and
[1310.76 → 1317.16] click let's go, and you can get professional ones these are actually huge for six dollars and 25 cents
[1317.16 → 1324.28] these are enormous no problem these are so big that'll be your 6090 let's connect let's connect
[1324.28 → 1331.40] a water hose to my graphics card pretty much i just I don't know man i NVIDIA might have some
[1331.40 → 1338.28] defence for this I don't know what it'll be but I just don't I just don't see how after all this
[1338.28 → 1343.72] drama it just didn't seem obvious that these are fragile little pins, and we just like shouldn't
[1343.72 → 1352.68] and again I'm not an engineer, but it just seems obvious, and it's one of those things where not
[1352.68 → 1358.84] only does it seem obvious because sometimes science is a science is a funny little sometimes where
[1358.84 → 1364.92] something can seem very obvious to the lay person but when you get into the actual science of it that
[1364.92 → 1371.72] seemingly obvious explanation is totally stupid right but not only did this seem obvious at the time
[1371.72 → 1377.56] but it has worked out that it was bad we have seen in the real world that we should just can we just
[1378.44 → 1386.84] stop is that an option like maybe NVIDIA could just this would be a great mitigation NVIDIA could call
[1386.84 → 1392.76] up all their partners tomorrow and say hey it put whatever power connectors you want on the new card
[1392.76 → 1401.56] designs yeah we're we're over it we're over it so they can keep this with their Fe's
[1401.72 → 1407.40] but everybody else can move because every power supply still needs to have PCIE power connectors on it
[1407.40 → 1411.88] for older GPUs and for AMD GPU AMD hasn't adopted the standard and neither has intel
[1413.24 → 1420.44] who maybe even is a relevant player at this point maybe so two of the three relevant players in discrete GPUs
[1420.44 → 1432.52] have not adopted the 12 volt high power or 12 volt um two by six so like it's not like we the whole industry moved on and oh my goodness
[1432.92 → 1435.72] everyone who bought a power supply in the last couple of years is
[1436.52 → 1443.48] it's a brick now because they're not going to be able to plug in the RTX 60 90 or whatever no everyone still has PCIE power connectors so yeah
[1443.48 → 1451.56] so NVIDIA just they could call up all their partners and just say okay it forget it use whatever you want
[1452.04 → 1458.84] we're going to do our thing or whatever because all the power supplies still support this connector or better, yet we could just not um
[1461.08 → 1467.00] sorry that we were such control freaks about this maybe we shouldn't have been because this like honestly didn't work out too good
[1467.00 → 1475.72] speaking about calling people I called the guy you called the guy I did call the guy so I made some notes
[1475.72 → 1481.56] I made some notes and look the guy is under no obligation to help me with any of this, and it was
[1481.56 → 1489.00] extremely gracious of him to give me some of his time um you know not everything that he I wouldn't hold him to
[1489.64 → 1494.92] anything that he said, but he definitely gave me some valuable information
[1494.92 → 1500.12] so the first thing he told me is that this particular vessel
[1501.24 → 1507.64] uh has been for sale for he thinks possibly much longer than 23 weeks
[1509.00 → 1510.68] that ain't a good sign yeah
[1511.96 → 1520.44] especially if you factor in that it supposedly got a complete refit in 2016 and was nicely updated in 2022
[1520.44 → 1527.40] that seems to suggest that very shortly after it was nicely updated they attempted to sell it
[1527.40 → 1534.44] which either tells us that the update didn't go so good, or it tells us that they updated it to sell
[1534.44 → 1543.48] to sell which is not I mean you've shopped for a house before as have I tell me this riddle me this
[1544.12 → 1549.88] do you want the house that got an update to prepare it for sale no, no what did you cover up
[1550.52 → 1557.40] why did you cover it why did you paint it yeah what is that paint hiding what is hiding under there
[1557.40 → 1567.88] show me uh okay so that isn't good um the other challenge that he brought up to me is okay so he also
[1567.88 → 1575.40] validated that my assumption that part of the issue with this ship is that anyone who can afford a vessel
[1575.40 → 1582.04] of this magnitude like here look guys just for perspective okay I know 123 feet doesn't mean
[1582.04 → 1588.12] anything to a lot of you because you're European you sensible units right so let me put it let me just
[1588.12 → 1596.12] put it in context okay the size of this vessel see these see this up here see these little like
[1596.12 → 1599.08] yellow and green things up here those basically dots
[1599.08 → 1613.48] that's this that's a whole like barbecue area this thing is freaking huge it is enormous
[1614.20 → 1621.32] um, and he validated for me that my assumption that part of the issue with selling it is that anyone who
[1621.32 → 1627.96] could afford the upkeep for this thing could afford a newer ship, and he also pointed out even though i
[1627.96 → 1633.96] hadn't really thought of this that anybody looking to charter a vessel of this size with that kind of
[1633.96 → 1640.60] budget they might want something newer too now I think we could get around some of that if the idea
[1640.60 → 1646.36] was that we Reno it we like to turn it into the gaming yacht I think that would be a pretty unique
[1646.36 → 1651.24] selling point and people aren't going to check if it was built in 1990 or 2090 I don't I don't think
[1651.24 → 1656.28] it'll really matter if it's got all that stuff on board I would care if it was built in 2090 well okay
[1656.28 → 1660.76] yeah fair enough that I would care a lot I meant like in the future I would charter that boat I think
[1660.76 → 1669.08] that's fair so the point is just that um you know it could impact not only our ability to sell it
[1669.08 → 1674.92] when we're done, but it could also impact our ability to get any revenue out of it once we've finished
[1674.92 → 1681.88] our renovation so we might end up you know buying this thing as a project and just completely being
[1681.88 → 1687.40] out that money with absolutely nobody wanting to use yeah and I got i have to be honest with you guys
[1688.84 → 1690.52] does this look like tanned skin
[1692.60 → 1701.96] do I look like I go outside hang out on the water like I'm not I'm not really an I'm not really a boating
[1701.96 → 1710.20] guy right um okay here's another sort of rough number that the guy gave me he goes uh upkeep on a
[1710.20 → 1718.76] ship this size they kind of say 10 of the value but um let me put it this way that ship is listed for
[1718.76 → 1728.60] about 1.6 1.7 million us dollars and uh and that's annually 10 annually so it's listed for 1.6 1.7 million us
[1728.60 → 1736.04] dollars and um you'd have to have at least two to three crew on it and if you wanted to have like
[1736.60 → 1741.80] guests on board it'd probably be more like five so you've got your captain you've got an engineer
[1741.80 → 1747.24] whose full-time job it is to like to take care of this ship keep the boat running you have at least
[1747.24 → 1752.52] one more and then for charters or whatever you need a couple for you know serving and cleaning and stuff
[1752.52 → 1757.56] like that right it's its practically a floating like hotel like yeah presidential suite yeah like
[1757.56 → 1765.24] it's huge yeah um so I think you guys probably have figured out the problem with that math then
[1765.24 → 1772.92] because 10 of you know 1.7 million us dollars would be 170 000 us dollars for five staff members for five staff members
[1772.92 → 1777.72] have fun also don't forget about you know regular cleaning of the ship itself I'm not talking
[1777.72 → 1782.84] like cleaning the rooms I'm talking pretty often and and and painting and uh you know dealing with
[1782.84 → 1790.12] it anytime something breaks uh so 10 of the value yeah that's probably based more on 10 of the value
[1790.12 → 1799.16] like when it was valued like it was new you know not like today so you could easily be spending
[1799.16 → 1806.28] you know 30 of the value of this thing 40 of the value of this thing a year depending on whether
[1806.28 → 1813.72] something goes wrong there's another big problem are you waiting for the part where I talk
[1813.72 → 1818.44] about the good stuff I know I want to know what the next big problem is okay all right I feel like
[1818.44 → 1826.04] there's more than one more yeah so the next big problem is that it is 123 feet long why is that a
[1826.04 → 1833.16] problem where the hell are you going to park excuse me I mean moor it uh-huh right it doesn't come with
[1833.16 → 1840.04] that right well it could he said he would reach out to the guy and find out the other guy and
[1840.04 → 1848.12] find out if mooring is included but what I can tell you now without naming anybody is I looked on the
[1848.12 → 1856.52] website of the place where it is moored today and I'm going to change a few details just because I don't
[1856.52 → 1863.72] want to like out a particular organization and their particular policies but in order to even
[1863.72 → 1872.60] qualify to have a conversation about mooring my boat there I would have to have you have to join the yacht
[1872.60 → 1882.36] club no fewer than four references whoa who can vouch for me wow and I'm changing some numbers and
[1882.36 → 1887.00] changing some details because I don't want you guys going and bothering any one of the most confusing
[1887.00 → 1894.60] things about obscenely high society to me is how many people are in it yeah that's that's the weirdest
[1894.60 → 1901.72] thing yeah you drive around bc and it's like man that's a nice car what an incredibly high amount of like
[1901.72 → 1909.08] three to ten million dollar homes three to ten million please let's let's go have a look at let's go have a look at
[1909.08 → 1918.44] haughty a neighbourhood in Vancouver British Columbia here we go boys oh boy meet haughty
[1918.44 → 1926.20] in this neighbourhood three to five million dollars would buy you nothing I feel you should realtor.ca
[1926.20 → 1933.08] try 30 to 50 million dollars 30 to 50 yeah like okay you can actually you can see it oh it's you can
[1933.08 → 1938.60] see it from way out here because you got your you got your actual like downtown density you're like high
[1938.60 → 1944.52] rises and all that you got your like urban you got your urban density and then you've got this
[1944.52 → 1951.08] that basically looks like freaking uh what would I even compare it to yeah it looks like
[1951.08 → 1957.56] delta yeah you know but it's just right there in the middle smack in the middle of like this
[1957.56 → 1964.76] the entire Vancouver Burnaby area ever been to that area oh um maybe driven past it, I have a relative
[1964.76 → 1969.00] that lives near there and when I say near there I don't mean on one of the big plots I mean like
[1969.00 → 1976.68] in the dense parts around it in the city and so just for loss once I was like we should go we should
[1976.68 → 1980.60] come on we should go drive through we should go drive through dude look how many of these places have
[1980.60 → 1989.80] pools look at the percentage of pool age here wow we're in Vancouver and as someone who owns a pool hey
[1989.80 → 1994.44] there's some private tennis courts that's always a good sign as someone who literally owns a pool i
[1994.44 → 2001.48] will tell you owning a pool in Vancouver is stupid for the a percentage of the time that you can
[2001.48 → 2008.04] actually use it out of the year the amount of maintenance and cost is stupid like it's its
[2008.04 → 2014.36] actually stupid and look at this look at this neighbourhood oh yeah right so it's not just the pool I mean
[2014.36 → 2021.80] what is this what is this man oh if is I bought this place i would i would complete
[2021.80 → 2027.80] it we'd have the square the circle the triangle and the x I would fix that up for them real good
[2028.68 → 2033.24] uh what it is it space or shift I can't, I can't remember space middle I can never remember how to
[2033.24 → 2038.12] get to the other to the other view on here Ben but like man these places are freaking wild like if you
[2038.12 → 2047.48] if you have you know an an a tennis ball court behind your house, and you're in Vancouver proper like
[2047.48 → 2053.64] this land right here for this tennis court wild is worth millions of dollars I was going to say
[2053.64 → 2059.56] that alone is worth millions for sure it is a million of dollars tennis courts for sure flipping wild dude
[2059.56 → 2067.16] no it's not that one it's the uh it's the like change the camera angle one I can never remember
[2067.16 → 2073.72] there it is hey oh yeah dude so that gives you just like density difference is wild yeah compared
[2073.72 → 2082.12] to like right next to it huh look at this you just cross arbutus, and it's like yeah we like our privacy
[2082.12 → 2091.16] we like all our trees look at this look at this wow glen croft house what else is in here ah yes
[2091.16 → 2099.00] knock place actually that's a good organization sing doc monastery association very best
[2099.00 → 2106.20] roof what is that what's very best roof roofing contractor five stars all right well I guess they
[2106.20 → 2112.12] have the very best roof good for them um how did we get onto this conversation uh
[2114.84 → 2117.72] do you guys want to see some haughty houses it's something to do with the yacht
[2118.36 → 2122.12] oh yeah that's right I was talking about the tech yacht okay oh how many people you need to know
[2122.76 → 2127.72] to get your mooring oh yeah and I pointed out that like it's crazy how many incredibly rich people
[2127.72 → 2134.76] there are that's the thing that always surprises me what do you mean okay do you guys want to do you guys
[2134.76 → 2139.72] want to see some houses in haughty do they care are they still into just like our overpriced real
[2139.72 → 2145.24] estate I think it's funny I think it's hilarious all right cool let's do it let's do it here we go
[2145.24 → 2153.16] realtor.ca I know this is super generic but i showed Emma recently some Texas mansions that
[2153.16 → 2160.68] are I would like to make a lot of money selling my apartment and buying oh yeah and I was just like
[2160.68 → 2166.92] like what the heck dude there is not a single house for sale in haughty right now
[2167.56 → 2172.84] do they sell it in some other way no, no no people no normally there's normally there's
[2172.84 → 2180.04] definitely stuff in here, but this is it's not loading anything oh no that's not in like the
[2180.04 → 2184.20] rich part of haughty no there's like oh there's like yeah this is nothing
[2184.20 → 2190.04] that is very surprising to me do I have like do I have filters on or something I don't think so
[2190.84 → 2197.32] you know what it is though you know what I bet it is there's been I wouldn't call it a crash yet
[2197.32 → 2201.88] but there's certainly been a correction there's been a downturn yeah there's been finally a
[2201.88 → 2210.12] correction in Vancouver real estate and even as someone that um is significantly invested in Vancouver
[2210.12 → 2218.04] real estate I have been rooting for this for a long time because it is not good for our society
[2218.04 → 2223.24] for nobody to be able to afford somewhere to live it is deeply broken up here yeah
[2225.48 → 2233.80] it hasn't gone down enough yet, but it has changed a little and people who own 25 30 40 million dollar
[2233.80 → 2239.48] houses are the kind of people that aren't necessarily under any pressure to sell when the market isn't good
[2240.28 → 2247.08] when the market's not right so if I had to guess I would say that nobody is selling right now in
[2247.08 → 2252.12] there because I think we've got some oh we've got one wasn't working oh what's wrong with my realtor.ca
[2252.12 → 2263.00] I'm not sure well here we go boys I've got a few 12 63 Balfour avenue 26 26 now these are Canadian rubles
[2263.00 → 2272.52] so like 30 bucks but still so we're looking at about 17 million us dollars 16 17 million us dollars
[2272.52 → 2276.44] only fairly recently though like last year before it would have been a lot more
[2279.88 → 2287.56] I too like a glass vessel on my table with a lazy Susan I prefer that look at this room
[2287.56 → 2294.76] what colour would you like it wood how much wood yes like it okay sure if they had more plant
[2295.32 → 2301.96] instead of one plant I think it could work pretty well mm-hmm oh yes sorry this one the indoor also
[2301.96 → 2307.72] has a pool, but we didn't like it outdoors because the indoor because Linus said it was stupid so we put
[2307.72 → 2313.08] it indoors where we can use it all year round oh man
[2315.64 → 2323.96] jeez it looks like it's you know in the country or whatever yeah, but this is in the city
[2323.96 → 2331.40] yeah how much land do you get for 26 million or whatever that was oh just like land yeah
[2331.40 → 2338.92] like what's the lot I don't know it depends oh shoot I missed that um I don't remember compare that
[2338.92 → 2348.28] to a 17 million dollar us super mansion yeah dude oh yeah dude Vancouver is uh comparing it to like
[2348.28 → 2354.20] pretty rough yeah like almost anywhere man it's crazy okay get this I don't know how we're all still
[2354.20 → 2361.88] here get this okay yeah you're not looking okay how big do you think the lot is from my
[2361.88 → 2366.12] perceptions it didn't it looked like it was a tight wrap around the house I don't think it was a huge
[2366.12 → 2373.16] lot but I could be completely wrong let's say 9 000 square feet oh, oh no you'd be you'd be pleasantly
[2373.16 → 2380.12] surprised it's more than that oh yeah yeah you'd be how big was the house uh the house is over 10 000
[2380.12 → 2385.48] square feet well okay that is an enormous house so I think part of the problem of your perception of
[2385.48 → 2391.72] or your ability to estimate it here is that that's a massive we only saw a few of the rooms right so
[2391.72 → 2396.44] you didn't really have anything for scale and those and that's an old neighbourhood those are big trees
[2397.08 → 2402.36] right so you didn't really have I think a sense of the proper scale of this house it better be an acre
[2402.36 → 2407.64] it's not an acre somebody says two acres it is not two acres i i would think it would be a
[2407.64 → 2413.32] stretch if it's more than 15 000 square feet okay Dan what do you think I'm gonna probably say half
[2413.32 → 2420.52] an acre you'll say half an acre all right um Luke is the closest without going over well it's 17
[2420.52 → 2427.32] 900 square feet yeah how many square feet it's half an acre uh about 20 20 something okay yeah yeah
[2427.32 → 2431.32] yeah maybe a little bit he said without going over so it's not really fair I think it's pretty
[2431.32 → 2435.08] close well it's always prices right rules I don't make the rules I don't make I think it's pretty
[2435.08 → 2441.72] close in between bob barker makes the rules um anyway that's been listed for 84 days so clearly
[2441.72 → 2447.72] nobody's buying it for that price, but it also is not outlandish for what you see things priced for
[2447.72 → 2452.28] in that neighbourhood it's flipping its flipping wild dude it's flipping wild all right what else we got
[2452.28 → 2459.80] going on today some merch messages ah yes merch messages if you guys want to interact with the show
[2459.80 → 2465.16] uh that's the perfect way to do it we don't really do twitch bits or super chats we do merch messages
[2465.16 → 2471.64] they will go to producer Dan haha we brought him back who will oh, oh who is going to be getting a lot
[2471.64 → 2477.88] of merch messages today because the kernite among you will have noticed this already, but we launched not
[2477.88 → 2487.16] one not two but three new products today that are um similar to but legally distinct from yes, yes yes
[2487.72 → 2495.40] some inspiration that we got from a small software company yeah not, not small in a literal sense
[2495.40 → 2503.16] small in a naming sense like almost like maybe a little bit bigger than NATO um yeah yeah
[2505.72 → 2513.80] bigger than NATO but smaller than desk yeah real small software company um
[2513.80 → 2521.08] um we've got what we're calling hold on here we go here we go what we're calling the do we
[2521.08 → 2530.28] have a name for them sure okay yes, yes yes we've got names good okay so each of us is modelling one of our
[2530.28 → 2536.92] three new shirt designs uh starting with that that that that doors
[2538.20 → 2544.36] so if you look very carefully you'll notice that these are in fact doors they actually have little
[2544.36 → 2548.52] handles on them of course they do because they're doors and not one on a door because they're doors
[2548.52 → 2554.92] and not windows and how else would you open them yeah okay so we've got the doors design which I am
[2554.92 → 2562.84] going to be modelling for the rest of the show we've got the uh brick design there you go comb that
[2564.76 → 2569.48] uh hold on a second I have my note my notes went away accidentally bumped them uh we've got the
[2570.36 → 2576.76] okay we call this one maze that one's called maze oh yeah and um yes and we've we've definitely

[2742.20 → 2750.20] want to be like that about it but guys we have no idea how long this product will last yeah we have
[2750.20 → 2759.00] no idea if we will ever be able to print more of them it's possible it's possible that a tiny
[2759.64 → 2765.96] I mean these are doors software company these are doors could I don't think they'd have a leg to stand
[2765.96 → 2771.64] on these are doors and there are kitties in there that's true that there's one on my shoulder it was up
[2771.64 → 2776.20] here I mean they were saying it was like on the band is just a depiction of the internet like my
[2776.20 → 2782.12] collar that's just the internet so I don't have that is a series of we're going to get sued by Dan flashes but
[2782.12 → 2787.88] I'm just I'm just saying I'm just saying that it is possible that if you want it's too complicated a
[2787.88 → 2793.80] conversation starter party shirt uh it's very similar to the original party shirt so uh if you guys
[2793.80 → 2800.68] liked that one this is that but with a very, very cool modern design um yeah you should probably
[2800.68 → 2805.00] just you should probably just order whichever ones you want and like do that all right
[2805.64 → 2808.68] what else were you supposed to oh right we're supposed to do some merch messages so you go on
[2808.68 → 2814.28] the store you type in your merch message in the cart, and it will go to producer Dan who will read it
[2814.28 → 2820.44] pop it up down here or even carried it for me and Luke to respond to so Dan you got a merch message
[2820.44 → 2825.40] or two for us, I do watch the behind the scenes video for the screensaver shirts do the older staff
[2825.40 → 2830.12] sometimes find it hard to relate to the younger staff what do you do to try to keep yourself up to
[2830.12 → 2837.48] date with the current meta that is an interesting choice there league player Elijah hasn't watched
[2837.48 → 2844.76] the Lord of the Rings I don't like learning things about that man he hasn't he hasn't seen it he like
[2844.76 → 2850.44] knows a lot of iconic moments and stuff because of memes meanwhile my family's starting our marathon
[2850.44 → 2858.12] this weekend yeah so it's not just that there were different movies you know because I think when we
[2858.12 → 2865.64] were kids our parents definitely listened to different albums, and they watched different movies
[2866.36 → 2871.56] but they definitely listened to albums, and they watched movies with some of the younger people
[2871.56 → 2878.12] that are joining the company now not all but some of them they literally don't watch movies like a whole
[2878.12 → 2887.80] movie it's just never heard of that oh dude it's just I'm probably very disconnected it's just not their
[2887.80 → 2895.80] medium the youth so it's not the medium yeah arty's in the chat right now me yeah it's a thing
[2895.80 → 2902.60] my only exposure to the youth really is when I go to the gym sorry you mean watch one thing for two
[2902.60 → 2910.76] and a half hours Luke that's just terrible experience every single time yeah yeah um what's i going to say
[2910.76 → 2915.40] yeah uh can't they just sit on their phone while they watch though don't they like watching two things
[2915.40 → 2919.88] like I would think movies would almost be a good medium for them, but then you're but yeah that's
[2919.88 → 2925.64] just one thing you sit on the couch on your background noise watching the movie for no doom-scrolling
[2925.64 → 2932.36] no because movies require a level of cognitive engagement I don't disagree sorry I disagree you
[2932.36 → 2939.56] disagree yeah as someone who grew up with their computer in the family room who would leave one ear
[2939.56 → 2943.56] off so I could listen to the movie and sometimes watch during certain points and play games
[2943.56 → 2948.52] the other bit okay so I think there are a lot of movies that you could kind of enjoy like that like
[2948.52 → 2956.36] if you're watching good burger sure fine there are a lot of movies like that this is true actually if we
[2956.36 → 2962.76] look at recently released movies over the last honestly six years that's the vast majority of them but
[2962.76 → 2967.24] we started this conversation with the Lord of the Rings the Lord of the Rings you have to dial in
[2967.24 → 2971.88] that's not you have to focus up now what about reading the books, but we talk about them not
[2971.88 → 2977.72] watching movies well we'll get to that we'll get to that but first no I would make the argument that
[2977.72 → 2982.44] if you want to have any flipping idea which one of the hobbits is the one that's obsessed with food
[2982.44 → 2987.80] and which one of them is the loyal one and which one cries a lot or whatever you have to be
[2987.80 → 2991.56] somewhat paying attention because the Lord of the Rings has a lot of characters I will agree I will
[2991.56 → 2997.32] agree with Lord of the Rings yeah i would want someone to pay attention my firstborn didn't
[2997.32 → 3002.28] make it through the fellowship of the ring oh how old was he when you try to do it uh about a year ago
[3003.00 → 3010.76] oh with that said I probably made a significant tactical error did you overpromise i
[3011.88 → 3017.72] I gave him the extended edition oh they're worse movies I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry at least
[3017.72 → 3022.04] you have one less kid we will definitely be worried about the extent i and that's great and that's
[3022.04 → 3031.40] fine and I'm glad you love them, but they're pretty slow yeah they're pretty slow oh yeah Linus
[3031.40 → 3037.32] cancelled all bloody hell I knew it was going to happen I knew it was going to happen um it was prophesied the
[3037.32 → 3041.64] books thing yeah I mean I think we've tried I started with the books just to flex so did I I think
[3041.64 → 3045.80] we've talked about this on the hobbit is what got me into reading at all I didn't like it very much and
[3045.80 → 3051.48] then hobbit's sick it started going with the hobbit um tom Boabdil I can't make it through
[3051.48 → 3056.60] that's the character nobody makes it through tom people hitting Ivy League universities that have
[3056.60 → 3062.76] never read a book I'm pretty sure we talked about that that's that's wild yeah yeah yeah the
[3062.76 → 3066.60] the prof will give them their like reading assignment for you know the first week or whatever
[3066.60 → 3071.08] what like, and they're like what like the whole thing like sorry these days honestly I doubt they
[3071.08 → 3076.84] even say what they just you know feed it into chat TPT or whatever summarize this book for me please
[3077.72 → 3083.88] thank you I need talking points for an essay oh good talking points uh please write that for me
[3084.76 → 3090.68] thank you I had to do Machiavelli if you had never read a book before imagine coming out of that and
[3090.68 → 3100.04] thinking that this was an uh not a manual especially as a business major everybody was like this
[3100.04 → 3105.64] guy's got some perfect points I'm going to do all of this yikes
[3109.72 → 3115.88] Machiavelli's in the new civ game wait did we ever actually finish the tech yacht conversation I don't
[3115.88 → 3122.60] know you got you went on to like mega mansions uh okay um they are related okay there's a couple
[3122.60 → 3126.68] more things that I just want to wrap up on the tech yachts come back to this message yeah we'll come
[3126.68 → 3130.84] we'll come back to well no wait did we answer this merge message no lets just finish the yacht and
[3130.84 → 3138.28] then we'll come back and talk about this I told you it's going to be a good show because I allow this
[3138.28 → 3147.88] structure I allowed this fine it is my design go back and talk about your boat Linus um so the guy
[3149.16 → 3155.72] the guy told me that yes it would be possible to haul it out of the water and dry dock it and work on
[3155.72 → 3164.36] it on land um he called it what do you call it on the hard we could work on it on the hard oh, oh yeah
[3164.36 → 3169.48] this guy's a boat guy I'm learning the lingo makes me feel good I'm learning the lingo so we could
[3169.48 → 3174.36] work on it on the hard, but he did say that it would be a lot cheaper to work on it just
[3174.92 → 3180.04] in the marina yeah um because anything other than painting is probably cheaper to do in the water
[3180.04 → 3183.88] because they're going to bill you by the day that you have it in their freaking shipyard because the
[3183.88 → 3187.64] size of this thing you can't just like you can't just like put it on the side of the road and you
[3187.64 → 3192.04] know work on if it is built by the day if you don't do it on the hard how do you paint the hull
[3192.04 → 3198.44] that has to be done on the hard yeah okay um you said it would be cheaper or whatever well
[3198.44 → 3205.16] you wouldn't work on the interior all right uh size of it major impediment to moving it blah blah blah
[3205.16 → 3213.16] blah blah blah um yeah he said that chartering even if they decide to take your ship like like a
[3213.16 → 3218.76] charter company they'll prioritize their own ships yeah and um you don't have to like to run it yourself
[3218.76 → 3223.24] they're going to take a bunch of money for managing it so basically you'll be lucky to break even on a
[3223.24 → 3228.84] per-transaction basis that's something that I found out on the plane side as well unless you're pretty
[3228.84 → 3234.76] much running your own company and your own crew it's not really practical so either way I think
[3234.76 → 3239.96] the reasonable conclusion is that regardless of whether we go tech yacht or tech plane we need more
[3239.96 → 3246.36] than one of them oh so we'll have our tech fleet uh, and we can really take advantage of the economies of
[3246.36 → 3253.72] scale of having more than one well you know a guy now a bulk deal it's like Costco but for yachts
[3254.52 → 3257.96] I think this yacht already is big enough to be the Costco pack
[3259.08 → 3264.36] that's probably about the same square footage yeah when the the the float plane company I don't
[3264.36 → 3269.16] remember what they're called they have a hilariously similar logo to us, I don't know if you've seen it
[3269.16 → 3276.52] um they're in Vancouver what are they called again um company in Vancouver
[3278.44 → 3284.12] harbour airs oh that sounds about right but then now I'm seeing a logo from them that looks really
[3284.12 → 3290.28] normal and I've seen a logo from them that looks like our logo but just vertical um would make sense
[3290.28 → 3295.48] for a float plane company it kind of would um I don't see it now but apparently as far as I can tell
[3295.48 → 3300.76] they make a pretty solid amount of their money from like commuters from Vancouver Island to van
[3300.76 → 3307.80] Vancouver proper yes um so what if you did like small you have to compete with them, they're very
[3307.80 → 3311.80] entrenched yeah that might not be a good idea yeah no I think I just won't do that they seem like they're
[3311.80 → 3317.32] happy doing their thing I mean if you chartered it from here to Nanaimo or something like that your
[3317.32 → 3319.56] your prices might be less than bc ferries but
[3319.56 → 3325.16] oof and actually run on time, and you probably have better food
[3327.64 → 3330.60] you wouldn't be able to take your car though, although you probably can't do that very often
[3330.60 → 3336.68] when they see ferries either they have triple o's on some of the ferries that's not that bad
[3336.68 → 3342.28] I don't mind a triple o's burger all right what the heck are we supposed to be talking about is that
[3342.28 → 3348.52] it for the yacht I think that's it for the yacht basically ah you know with how cheap it is apparently
[3348.52 → 3354.68] to fly from yeah it's pretty reasonable isn't it is might be cheaper to just like
[3355.56 → 3362.92] get real estate on the island and then fly to work every day not bad it's not expensive yeah that's
[3362.92 → 3367.64] crazy you'd have to park it you'd have to park a car how does that even make any sense how can you
[3367.64 → 3375.00] like they fill the plane oh okay that's not a solo flight they're they're like timed departures
[3375.00 → 3380.68] oh okay, okay yeah, but it's just a ferry it's and it's an air ferry basically and that's also known
[3380.68 → 3390.20] as a ferry get a half bell that costs about as much as taking the normal ferry yeah like Tainan
[3390.20 → 3394.44] pointed this out like living in Calgary and flying to UBC instead of renting in bc there's a there's a
[3394.44 → 3398.44] kid that did that yeah that's a real story yeah I heard about it, and it was like financially
[3398.44 → 3405.96] reasonable which is completely absurd it just shows like how broken real estate is here
[3408.28 → 3415.00] it needs to it needs to like to plummet it needs to cry says how can Linus not know this because i
[3415.00 → 3423.64] don't commute via flow plane between the island and the mainland oh man i it's because I just don't know
[3423.64 → 3433.88] that I've never had a reason to do that man I'm i I think I would move for like personal drone like
[3433.88 → 3439.24] the float plane thing that I mean that doesn't seem that practical because with the embarking and
[3439.24 → 3442.84] disembarking and the fact that they're probably dropping you off in like the Vancouver harbour and
[3442.84 → 3448.04] all that oh it's wicked fast is it oh yeah the embarking disembarking is wicked fast
[3448.04 → 3452.76] you're not doing customs you're not doing I know you're not doing customs, but there's
[3452.76 → 3458.92] got to be security with your ticket we did it really oh that's right you guys did it's fast
[3458.92 → 3463.24] but the only whole reason of waiting is we showed up way too early and then like stood around
[3463.24 → 3468.84] okay define fast though because like I don't want to commute more than half an hour there's like
[3468.84 → 3473.08] because I still gotta get in my car on the other side I don't mean the plane speed get to the office
[3473.08 → 3477.16] you were saying embarking and disembarking no I mean overall yeah the whole thing is like i
[3477.16 → 3482.28] wouldn't want to commute that if I was in the office two days a week or one day a week I might
[3483.00 → 3487.32] consider living on the island we don't we don't uh we didn't we just went around in a circle we did
[3487.32 → 3491.64] the scenic tour we didn't fly to the island back so I don't know but what I would what I would want
[3491.64 → 3497.64] is like the personal drone like the personal quad copter or whatever i think I would move
[3498.20 → 3503.56] for it if you is there was an if there was an if you had a personal drone and I could just land on my
[3503.56 → 3508.44] roof at homeland on my roof at the office you'd put a like held landing pad I don't think the city
[3508.44 → 3514.12] of surrey would allow it I don't think Canada has made any meaningful progress on that what if you
[3514.12 → 3521.40] made it so that there was like uh horizontally opening doors, and you like landed in a bay I do
[3521.96 → 3525.64] you're not landing on the roof I'll just go down by a ladder like I don't I don't I don't need anything
[3525.64 → 3531.88] like that I would then you're not landing on the roof oh i just oh I mean my issue is just the city
[3531.88 → 3536.52] of surrey wouldn't even just allow us to do anything like that they there's no way our strata would allow
[3536.52 → 3541.56] us to modify our building so that that it is a non-starter like right out of the gate bribes
[3542.44 → 3547.96] um a stratum for those of you I have an easy solution actually oh no problem okay crime
[3547.96 → 3555.24] that is usually where it goes in this case yeah it's a hr probably but dressed up a little bit
[3555.24 → 3560.92] better uh we have to bring back Linus town oh my god you can make your own law
[3562.36 → 3568.92] everybody is allowed to have a personal flying part of our religion person drone yeah we're still gonna
[3568.92 → 3574.68] need to follow like transport Canada you know rules and stuff for air travel uh and I don't think
[3574.68 → 3580.44] Canada tough for them, I don't think I don't think Canada's made any meaningful progress I think
[3580.44 → 3586.36] they've got some bigger things to deal with you know the Americans uh coming up here sounds like
[3586.36 → 3595.32] a good time to shoe in some opportunity jeez speaking of shoeing and shall we finish this
[3595.32 → 3599.80] merch message now yeah what even was it again I don't even remember I watched the behind the scenes
[3599.80 → 3605.40] video for your screensaver shirts do the older staff sometimes find it hard to relate to the younger
[3605.40 → 3609.40] staff what do you do to try and keep yourself up to date with the current meta I keeping yourself up
[3609.40 → 3614.04] to date honestly a lot of the time is as simple as just talking to people who are younger than you
[3614.04 → 3623.80] like I am often surprised by how disconnected the other parents in my cohort are of the friends of my
[3623.80 → 3630.60] children and I'm not calling out anybody specifically I'm just saying that like you know I'll be like i
[3630.60 → 3636.28] set up discord for my kids like I set up accounts for them and I set them up with a server and i kind
[3636.28 → 3641.16] of showed them okay here's how you do some basic moderation on your server and stuff like that and then
[3641.88 → 3647.08] I'll talk to other parents and they their kids are on discord they literally don't even know what it is
[3647.08 → 3650.84] like they're on discord with my kid and the parents don't even know what it is and I'm like
[3650.84 → 3656.60] like discord isn't an algorithmic social media platform we've discussed this before on wan show
[3656.60 → 3660.52] and we kind of agreed that while it isn't algorithmic so it doesn't have some of the same
[3660.52 → 3664.68] issues that something like Facebook or TikTok definitely still social media it's definitely
[3664.68 → 3670.76] still social media, and you've got like nine-year-olds on there, and you know you gotta be aware
[3670.76 → 3676.84] of what they're doing you've got to understand these tools and just being around young younger
[3676.84 → 3681.72] people and knowing what they're using and what they're doing with it is extremely helpful and
[3681.72 → 3686.76] that doesn't mean that I have to use all of it like I have never installed Snapchat because I don't need
[3687.56 → 3693.72] a messaging platform that deletes my messages when I'm done I don't send anybody dick pics which is the
[3693.72 → 3698.76] only reason that I can think of even if you did there would be a better way to do it because it doesn't
[3698.76 → 3707.72] really delete it, and they can screenshot it mail yeah, yeah like post yeah do you think that
[3707.72 → 3713.96] happened that probably happened get out that probably did happen in the ye old day in the Polaroid days
[3713.96 → 3720.36] I'm sure somebody that probably I'm sure somebody has mailed a Polaroid of their Wang and I bet you
[3720.36 → 3726.68] despite it being like lower quality they probably still didn't put much more work into if it was
[3726.68 → 3735.56] probably still a like and then just mail it off I bet I paid meet on the AOL chat room and just fax them
[3735.56 → 3740.76] but yeah, and you know what i think a big part of it too is that we cover tech for a living
[3740.76 → 3750.76] and that we game has become um so age agnostic, and we used to think of it as a terrible thing
[3750.76 → 3758.44] you know when you'd have like some kid on the voice chat that's annoying or whatever but now I mean it
[3758.44 → 3762.84] don't care at all can also it can still be annoying, but it can also be a good thing because it depends
[3762.84 → 3767.24] you're not disconnected well yeah and depends on the adult too yeah um
[3770.52 → 3775.08] Blake maverick says Snapchat is good for video calling between android and iPhone there are
[3775.96 → 3783.00] so many solutions for that you 1000 do not need Snapchat for that yeah um skype
[3786.28 → 3789.40] hey we're wearing the old shirt I don't know what you're talking about
[3789.40 → 3794.60] yeah no they used to be there at that point they were their own independent company
[3797.48 → 3802.20] did someone say gaming yeah, but you don't count any more yeah you're not even young any more you're
[3802.20 → 3809.24] like mini boomer now mid to late 20s you yeah ew yeah it's like 30 that category any more all right
[3809.80 → 3814.68] what do we what else we got today I have a second merch message you've got a lot more than a second
[3814.68 → 3819.32] merch message but I have to read you a second merch message people are they like these shirts
[3819.32 → 3823.96] they are loving these shirts loving these shirts a second merch message has hit the bricks what about
[3823.96 → 3834.84] second you hit the bricks get out of here hi dll.dll I had to recompile MOF files to fix Wei in windows
[3834.84 → 3839.64] this week to get some functions in PowerShell to work again that's managed object format and windows
[3839.64 → 3846.52] management instrumentation what the weird what's the weirdest pc issues you've had recently hidden
[3846.52 → 3851.32] office uh used yet I haven't used it yet but I'm very tempted sometimes I walk up those stairs and i
[3851.32 → 3859.56] see the RGB calling to me uh as for weirdest pc issue I've had recently oh dude I'm sure there's something
[3859.56 → 3869.48] uh oh crap okay it wasn't strictly speaking a pc issue but i I had an issue with my car play yesterday
[3869.48 → 3877.08] where I was listening to music, and it sounded like I was tuned into like an am radio station that like i
[3877.08 → 3886.04] just barely had reception for and I checked and I was on CarPlay what is this I'm turning off the car
[3886.04 → 3890.20] turning off the phone turning everything back on and connecting again like fixed it but I was like
[3891.48 → 3894.52] I've never seen that before I don't know how that would happen everything else about CarPlay was
[3894.52 → 3900.44] working fine so clearly the know data link between the phone and the car was fine the only
[3900.44 → 3907.16] thing that has started making my car feel like uh and I can't tell if it's actually my phone or my car
[3907.16 → 3912.04] yeah uh because Emma's phone seems to connect to my car no problem so it might be just my phone
[3912.04 → 3917.48] but I'm having like Bluetooth issues and that's actually pretty annoying at this point but uh
[3918.12 → 3921.56] I had an i have you know how I had that issue with my phone that I thought was just me and it
[3921.56 → 3924.76] turned to a bunch of people in chat had it where like when I would unlock my phone it would just open
[3924.76 → 3929.56] the YouTube app and open shorts immediately and I was like what the heck um I have another weird
[3929.56 → 3936.52] conspiracy theory um but this time I doubt even more than anyone else is running into it very
[3936.52 → 3944.68] close to the 5000 series GPU launch there was a driver update that I installed and now if I'm like
[3944.68 → 3953.96] playing a game uh videos in browsers will have major issues like the video will stop playing but the audio
[3953.96 → 3959.96] will keep playing, or it will entirely stop working and then have to load for a long time and then
[3959.96 → 3965.40] finally pop back in have you tried turning off hardware acceleration I've tried a few different things it's uh
[3965.40 → 3970.76] uh it's upset turning off hardware acceleration usually helps but then like you're turning off
[3970.76 → 3976.04] hardware yeah which kind of blows yeah uh willing spy pointed out there was that ram that didn't want
[3976.04 → 3981.24] to train for a long time the other day uh after the stream there is more people how does this keep
[3981.24 → 3987.00] happening I don't know what that it is uh
[3987.00 → 3988.20] uh
[3990.44 → 3994.84] this issue is not new NVIDIA had drivers that exhibit this behaviour before oh all right there
[3994.84 → 4000.76] you go I've never experienced it uh, so the ram did train, and we did get uh 256 gigs working in
[4000.76 → 4007.48] that AMD system at apparently 5200 mega transfers per second which is pretty darn impressive and I don't
[4007.48 → 4012.52] know the whole thing didn't make any sense to me like during script review I was like kind of annoyed
[4012.52 → 4019.16] with David for bringing me an AMD build that had that was using Cu dims because Cu dims are uh
[4019.16 → 4024.28] technology that only intel supports and AMD platforms you can use the dims in them but they
[4024.28 → 4029.00] just run in bypass mode they don't even yeah use any of the special tomfoolery that's supposed to
[4029.00 → 4033.56] allow them to go faster and I was like to we're gonna look like idiots, but he's like no, no Asus and
[4033.56 → 4038.36] Kingston like work together specifically on these specific dims and this board to like
[4038.36 → 4045.48] like high capacity whatever higher research yeah keep prepared well Asus sponsored the stream and
[4045.48 → 4050.36] they wanted to show off this dims because they like did this work anyway it is did ultimately work
[4050.36 → 4055.96] at 5200 apparently after the stream so that's pretty cool um I had a couple of people say that
[4055.96 → 4061.80] apparently it'll switch over to Bluetooth LE mode, but my understanding is that the iPhone still
[4061.80 → 4071.32] doesn't do Bluetooth LE uh iPhones don't support LE audio sadly is the first result here LE audio is
[4071.32 → 4077.88] a new standard or blah blah blah Feb 2024 is this something apple will be introducing yeah I'm not
[4077.88 → 4083.24] I'm not aware of apple actually supporting audio over Bluetooth LE but maybe you guys can let me know if
[4083.24 → 4089.24] I'm mistaken on that as a follow-up to chat talking about the issue that I had apparently just
[4089.24 → 4096.92] everybody has it every version somebody with a 5000 series GPU has it uh somebody with an AMD GPU
[4096.92 → 4104.84] has it is seems to just be all over the place cool yeah it's not LE audio it's a different bit rate
[4104.84 → 4111.16] for call kit okay does sound like a Bluetooth yeah yeah it wouldn't surprise me if it's a Bluetooth glitch
[4111.16 → 4117.56] but uh it was definitely Tripp because I felt like I'd gone back in time it really did just
[4117.56 → 4125.08] sound like a badly tuned am radio it was wild all right what else we got for today Dan you got
[4125.08 → 4130.12] another merch message for us no we just uh let's do another topic, and then we'll head into sponsors
[4130.12 → 4139.16] okay this announcement here should we do this now oh sure we recently built the ultimate sleeper gaming TV
[4139.16 → 4147.72] it's pretty sick it's got a pc with a RTX 4090 it's got a Wii U embedded in it with a spot for the
[4147.72 → 4152.92] sensor bar to mount at the top and a little flap that comes down so you can load discs in if it's got
[4152.92 → 4159.32] a PlayStation 5 on this mount over here, and it even has a spot where a switch can go in at the back
[4159.32 → 4163.72] and I mean a Nintendo Switch not a network switch there's also a network switch but that one's on
[4163.72 → 4168.20] the inside I was going to say both sound very realistic full disclosure the Nintendo Switch
[4168.20 → 4176.28] mounts a little Jacky um and that only matters because um I want to know if anyone wants to buy it
[4178.12 → 4183.72] because it's like super cool, but we don't want to store it forever yeah so the bill of materials for
[4183.72 → 4193.32] this thing is about twelve thousand dollars um us is that right it tells us in the dark it's got an OLED TV in
[4193.32 → 4199.24] the front it's super cool it weighs a freaking ton like you know a CRT would it actually works great
[4199.24 → 4208.76] the speakers sound amazing so uh yeah if anybody you know wants it, it would feel really sad it's a
[4208.76 → 4216.36] Wii not a Wii U it's a modded Wii U with a HDMI port mini HDMI yeah uh hold on this is the frame i
[4216.36 → 4220.76] want I don't you hate that okay there you go so there's the inside of if it's got this acoustic
[4220.76 → 4226.36] uh dampening so that the know sound is better, and it doesn't like vibrate or whatever uh there's
[4226.36 → 4231.32] a couple little things you might want to do I might, you know uh configure a fan curve for those
[4231.32 → 4237.88] fans they're a little loud at the moment, but it's very cool and we get people asking us all the
[4237.88 → 4241.40] time like what do you guys do with stuff when you're done with it and the answer more often than
[4241.40 → 4248.92] not unfortunately as we take it apart because this may surprise you, but we also have a limited number of
[4249.72 → 4255.64] like top spec GPUs and CPUs and stuff, and we often need to reuse them for new projects
[4255.64 → 4262.04] um, so there's a forum post which Dan will throw in all the various chats if you are interested in
[4262.04 → 4268.36] putting a serious offer in uh please go leave a comment on our forum post, and we can't ship it
[4268.36 → 4274.92] just to get that out of the way there is absolutely no way that we would ship it, so someone wants
[4274.92 → 4284.52] it then uh yeah uh good luck with that uh what else we got oh yeah we're going to do a couple of uh topics
[4284.52 → 4292.84] um YouTube is apparently the new television our source here is the YouTube blog in a blog post
[4292.84 → 4300.92] reflecting on 20 years of YouTube CEO Neil Johan revealed that TV is now the most popular device by
[4300.92 → 4309.56] watch time for YouTube viewing in the US and according to Nielsen YouTube has been number one
[4309.56 → 4317.64] in streaming watch time in the US for the past two years that even though I live and breathe this is
[4317.64 → 4324.28] my entire freaking career and my company I still find that astounding
[4325.64 → 4329.00] genuinely stunning to me, I don't know like
[4330.92 → 4338.20] I don't know it doesn't seem right i I can never remember how this horrible new dashboard
[4338.20 → 4342.44] it might just be so deeply based around um
[4345.24 → 4348.68] like the fact that if you're watching on your phone you're probably watching short content and
[4348.68 → 4354.44] they're strictly going off of watch time yeah but like I mean you might leave YouTube for a long time
[4354.44 → 4357.32] yeah, but you might leave YouTube running on your TV when you like walk away
[4357.32 → 4364.68] and stuff the background noise type situation I'm watching on my TV YouTube app right now wild
[4365.88 → 4374.36] I'm trying to man I have such a hard time this new dashboard which isn't really new anymore
[4374.36 → 4381.72] but it's just it's what is that, so this is the comparison metrics whoa so more metrics I'm trying to look
[4381.72 → 4391.16] for device and is there a search no with that many things you kind of in screens clips revenue members
[4391.16 → 4401.00] interactions live I did I can never i I've I've figured this out at least a dozen times and then I've had to
[4401.00 → 4407.32] re-figure it out every single flipping time he has published
[4409.08 → 4414.36] yeah I don't know view traffic sources view time hours it's probably no it's not traffic sources
[4415.24 → 4424.52] uh and then there's came out of metric here we go uh yeah it's its got to be its devices it's its some kind of
[4424.52 → 4429.88] if anyone can find it let me know it's its so horrible
[4432.28 → 4440.76] subscribers it comments like drives me crazy drives me crazy I don't see it at all yeah it's definitely
[4440.76 → 4447.56] in there it's a thing more oh here we go here we go maybe it's one of these player type that might be it
[4447.56 → 4456.68] it YouTube main embedded no oh for crying out loud uh device there it is okay so watch time hours by
[4456.68 → 4462.84] device so we do not even sort of follow the trend no not even a little we are not trendy boys
[4464.68 → 4469.72] so maybe that's why it doesn't make any sense to us because we are in a niche that really likes
[4469.72 → 4479.08] that computer yep wow so here 's's last month this is the last month that we have complete data for
[4479.64 → 4486.28] and computer took the lion's share uh with a little under half of overall viewership
[4486.28 → 4493.56] mobile phone is next uh TV third and tablet bringing up the rear this is a probably about what I would have
[4493.56 → 4501.32] expected which means I am solidly within our own private little echo okay boomer yeah I guess you
[4501.32 → 4506.28] just said that to literally all of them though I mean not literally all of them half of them I guess
[4506.28 → 4517.56] half man fair enough yeah broadly to the audience as a bucket okay boomer yeah pretty uh it's like the
[4517.56 → 4527.32] Shawnees version of boomer or the French version all right why don't we jump into our sponsor
[4527.32 → 4531.88] spots are we supposed to do that Dan are we supposed to do something else first okay we'll do that the

[4625.80 → 4632.36] this side with our sponsor odd pieces uh your puzzles are more their puzzles are more than just pictures
[4632.36 → 4638.76] so you oh there you go so you do get like a picture on the front I actually did this one with
[4638.76 → 4644.92] my kids a while back you get a picture on the front you get a picture in the included um in the like
[4644.92 → 4653.16] included uh picture sheet, but it doesn't actually match the finished puzzle so it's like a before state
[4653.16 → 4657.40] and then there's like a bunch of different little storylines, and they've got a little included comic and
[4657.40 → 4664.28] stuff and um so you actually can kind of see what happens after the version of the picture that you
[4664.28 → 4669.32] have once you're finished with the puzzle it's its pretty cool there's also some fun additional
[4669.32 → 4673.72] activities so when you're done you don't just look at it and go well okay is this one of the ones we
[4673.72 → 4678.28] glue together and put on the wall or is this one of the ones that we scramble up and throw back in the
[4678.28 → 4685.00] box um there's like little um search games and stuff like that um I ad-libbed all of that so I have no
[4685.00 → 4690.04] idea what I have or haven't talked about ah yes here each set comes with a thousand high quality
[4690.04 → 4694.68] puzzle pieces two puzzle maps two-story comics a limited edition sticker pack a hidden clue checklist
[4694.68 → 4699.80] and an ultimate riddle there could be a hidden story a mystery or even a secret ending and when
[4699.80 → 4704.28] you think you're done there might be a twist you'll be treated to a narrative experience rather than
[4704.28 → 4712.04] just a stagnant picture so check out odd pieces and get 15 off your first order using our link in the
[4712.04 → 4718.12] video description finally the show is brought to you by corsair are you fed up with cases that don't
[4718.12 → 4726.68] let you tweak and cool things just right our sponsor corsair's frame 4000d is the solution for you

[4765.16 → 4771.16] description that was a lot of pretty front panels there all right what else what do you want to talk
[4771.16 → 4780.36] about uh total copied our verified actual gamer program I'm happy about it total is trying to stiff
[4780.36 → 4788.20] the scalpers by selling RTX 50 series graphics cards directly to gamers via discord their priority access
[4788.20 → 4794.84] campaign allows active participants of the total gaming discord to enter for a chance to purchase one of a
[4794.84 → 4800.76] a limited number of 50 series cards available at MSRP winners have a limited time to complete their
[4800.76 → 4807.88] purchase all serials are tracked and there is a zero tolerance policy against reselling and scalping
[4808.68 → 4815.16] after a massive influx of new discord members total has tweaked the program to make it more inclusive
[4815.80 → 4820.12] stating that while active engagement is always encouraged selection will be based on a fair random
[4820.12 → 4826.60] process not participation so you don't have to spam the discord yep uh I mean we ran into some issues
[4826.60 → 4832.04] when we launched verified actual gamer as well like I remember uh one of the early ones the game was really
[4832.04 → 4840.36] hard, and we had people sort of talking to us very respectfully actually about how that might not be great for
[4840.36 → 4849.24] accessibility yeah, and we were like oh right being good at video games is not necessarily um necessary to
[4849.24 → 4855.32] be an actual gamer but we so the way that we got around that was we changed the game every single time
[4855.32 → 4860.20] because yes uh one of the reasons why we had made it hard initially was we didn't want people to be able
[4860.20 → 4866.28] to like to do it too fast or bought it one of the two yeah slow people down, and we didn't want people to be
[4866.28 → 4872.76] able to bought it so instead we changed it every single time so batting it would be difficult yeah
[4872.76 → 4879.96] or pointless yeah um, so a human would beat it before you could code a bot to beat it was kind of the
[4879.96 → 4886.52] idea uh behind that but uh I mean I guess it just highlights that there's always there's always challenges
[4886.52 → 4894.76] like there's always a monkey paw you know you try to do something in good faith and uh it doesn't
[4894.76 → 4901.32] always it doesn't always work out that great yeah um verified actual gamer I think we ended up losing
[4901.32 → 4905.56] money on it in case your curious oh I'm sure we did yeah because we did sell at MSRP if you include
[4905.56 → 4911.88] the development time, and we did buy them at less than MSRP so you know theoretically the gross profit
[4911.88 → 4917.64] on it was positive, but after we put all the work into it and after some people cancelled their orders
[4917.64 → 4924.36] and then they were lost in a warehouse for three years um losing value well that wasn't uh yeah
[4925.32 → 4930.28] that wasn't that wasn't that was probably avoidable but i I only found out about it a little while ago
[4930.28 → 4937.88] okay yeah so that's pretty funny way to go team steam accidentally distributes malware
[4938.60 → 4947.00] generic looking free-to-play survival game pirate phi pirate fl pirate phi I don't know uh which peaked at a
[4947.00 → 4958.44] concurrent player base of five nice sick was removed from the platform uh was removed from steam
[4958.44 → 4963.40] after an update to the game containing malware was distributed on the platform valve contacted the
[4963.40 → 4970.52] affected players roughly 800 to 1500 people who have downloaded the game and strongly encouraged a full
[4970.52 → 4975.08] system scan using an antivirus or to consider fully reformatting your operating system
[4975.08 → 4979.88] discussion should digital storefronts do a better job vetting games and developers
[4980.36 → 4987.96] no mention of the game exists from before 23 days ago that last bit seems like it could have
[4988.68 → 4993.96] you know kind of been vetted but overall it's also tough because what if you just don't want to
[4993.96 → 5000.04] develop in public, and you just want to launch on steam uh and overall I would say that in general
[5000.04 → 5007.40] steam has had very little malware shambles very, very few considering how much data they dump onto people's
[5007.40 → 5012.36] systems um feels like they must have acted on this pretty quick and dealt with it pretty well pretty
[5012.36 → 5018.92] quickly um I don't think we want a scenario where they're super heavy-handed honestly the app stores
[5018.92 → 5026.92] right now are really they've gotten better actually I think I am carrying baggage from years ago when they
[5026.92 → 5031.24] used to be super annoying now they're a little annoying Luke's feeling a little emotional right
[5031.24 → 5036.04] now yeah okay we need to give them space, and we need to give them time yeah yeah um they've they've
[5036.04 → 5041.32] they've gone better but they used to be a huge pain to deal with um, so there's a kind of happy
[5041.32 → 5048.76] medium and as much as I'll flag them for their 30 cut being a little ridiculous um they do some work
[5048.76 → 5053.24] they do some work yeah and the happy medium I think has been found on this I don't think we should
[5053.24 → 5058.68] really change anything until we run into a bunch more problems when that happens I mean given that
[5058.68 → 5064.68] steam manages to maintain a very low level of malware distributed by the platform by scanning
[5064.68 → 5069.56] initial game releases maybe they just need to do that exact same thing with updates and then maybe
[5069.56 → 5078.28] this whole thing is solved yeah sweet now this is pretty big maybe could be pretty big the
[5078.28 → 5085.56] first major AI copyright case in the U.S. has been decided Thomson Reuters has won the first major AI
[5085.56 → 5091.48] copyright case in a lawsuit filed in 2020 Thomson Reuters claimed that materials from its legal research
[5091.48 → 5099.40] tool west law had been reproduced by legal AI startup Ross intelligence a district court ruled in Thompson
[5099.40 → 5106.44] Reuters favour on Tuesday stating none of Ross's possible defences hold water I reject them all
[5106.44 → 5115.24] importantly the AI in question here is not generative AI it does not write anything itself it only surfaces
[5115.24 → 5121.40] existing material in response to a prompt making it essentially a search engine this limits the case's
[5121.40 → 5129.00] utility as a precedent for other lawsuits against generative AI companies um like the one we're about
[5129.00 → 5134.76] to talk about meanwhile the news media alliance a huge collection of news and magazine publishers
[5134.76 → 5139.48] including the likes of Condé Nast the guardian and Vox media has filed a copyright and trademark
[5139.48 → 5145.80] infringement lawsuit against enterprise AI company cohere claiming cohere uses unlicensed copies of content
[5145.80 → 5153.40] to directly compete with publishers and listed 4 000 specific examples of verbatim regurgitations and
[5153.40 → 5164.44] substitutional summaries of new content so I realized that there is a difference between a search database
[5164.76 → 5173.64] um, and you know starting out copyrighted content and a generative AI that trains itself on copyrighted
[5173.64 → 5180.44] content and then regurgitates harts out something very similar yeah, but it seems to me that if any of
[5180.44 → 5191.64] this holds up um it could basically stop AI development dead in its tracks in the US yes oh yeah no, no no
[5191.64 → 5198.60] it'll just it'll just make America lose um and that's a really complicated question and sure is no
[5198.60 → 5207.56] matter how you answer this you're going to peeve somebody oh 100 what should they do I have genuinely
[5207.56 → 5213.80] no idea but what I do know okay let's make Dan unpopular if Dan is what should they do America just
[5213.80 → 5221.80] loses sorry I have not been listening okay should America enforce copyright in a way that is both
[5221.80 → 5230.52] common sense and legally sensible um by penalizing shutting down access to basically obliterating
[5230.52 → 5237.24] anyone who trained their AI on copyrighted material which is as far as we can tell everyone who just
[5237.24 → 5244.28] plundered first asked for permission later or should America just lose the development race
[5244.92 → 5250.60] for AI because all this they've already lost it to China so who cares oh they're calling back
[5250.60 → 5258.68] well that'll be unpopular yeah um have you used the new Gemini stuff not the new Gemini stuff no yeah
[5258.68 → 5264.44] is it uh good or bad pretty good it's all pretty good I've always said that it's built on uh
[5264.44 → 5269.88] AI is built on child graves basically stolen
[5272.52 → 5278.20] yeah, but it's already done there's open source models um this is the problem it's out of the bag
[5278.20 → 5283.96] right it's its it's not even like slightly out of the bag it is out of the bag and down the street
[5283.96 → 5289.56] like there's open source models people are training on their own already uh a lot of the libraries of
[5289.56 → 5293.88] pirated content have like leaked to a certain degree I don't know if I should say a lot some of the
[5293.88 → 5301.56] libraries of pirated content have leaked um, and you have non-us companies competing very heavily
[5301.56 → 5307.08] with American companies so the only thing that this will accomplish is make it so that the companies
[5307.08 → 5313.72] that are worth using their tools for um and if anyone tries to jump in and be like no we would just use
[5313.72 → 5320.68] North American ones no shot at all you will capitulate immediately and use whatever thing is
[5320.68 → 5326.44] best uh this has been proven a trillion times over there's no even point talking about it so it just
[5326.44 → 5331.40] guarantees that countries that are not following your laws are going to be the ones that win this
[5331.40 → 5337.16] particular race so I don't know we talked about this a long time ago right like the same debate of
[5337.16 → 5343.56] like oh American lawmakers should pass laws to slow down AI development it's like okay now pass laws to
[5343.56 → 5347.32] lose like that's the only thing that's going to be accomplished the whole rest of the world's going to keep
[5347.32 → 5354.60] going everything now is global the laws in your particular area are they're interesting deeply
[5354.60 → 5359.72] irrelevant to overall progress, but they're interesting but other than that I don't really know uh
[5361.00 → 5367.32] I don't know how much impact they can have on the direction the world is going yep um you think china's
[5367.32 → 5373.32] going to stop developing AI stuff because some American companies get upset about copyright it's over
[5373.32 → 5380.68] it's done it's done first that said then is copyright dead and the answer is it's complicated
[5381.64 → 5387.88] it's uh what's the I saw this is not an original thought i I'm stealing this from someone but I don't
[5387.88 → 5393.88] remember who and I don't remember from where but um one of the founders of Reddit uh pirated like a
[5393.88 → 5402.12] bunch of uh science papers or something um and then got like some insane amount of years in jail
[5402.12 → 5409.72] mm-hmm and then ended up uh ending what's the what's the YouTube appropriate word for that
[5410.68 → 5416.60] I think we can just leave it there okay yeah yeah sounds good yeah Aaron Swartz um so like that's
[5416.60 → 5422.04] how hard we were on stuff back then, and then we're going to let this go that doesn't feel good no it really
[5422.04 → 5428.12] doesn't that doesn't feel right that doesn't feel right for anyone whose work was stolen 100 including
[5428.12 → 5436.12] yours including mine yep but like what what what do you if you think about chess moves what happens as
[5436.12 → 5441.72] a result of this that's where it gets weird yeah because it's like I don't want to learn mandarin
[5441.72 → 5449.96] yeah I'm I'm I'm joking a little bit but insert any other one but insert anything else what's that European
[5449.96 → 5458.04] uh AI company uh m their logo's an m do you know Dan not off the top of my head no sorry be an AI
[5458.04 → 5467.32] company this will probably find it anthropic mistral mistral mistral AI just reading um so like you know
[5467.32 → 5471.96] you know it's not just necessarily china that's going to win, but there are big companies
[5471.96 → 5479.00] making big moves outside the US yeah, and they're all using a pretty similar pool of data
[5479.00 → 5486.04] which a lot of it is American yeah in one particular case yours so if you copyright
[5486.04 → 5494.12] own the Americans it makes so the Americans can't compete that in no way will stop the rest of the
[5494.12 → 5498.84] world from pushing on this I mean copyright law in general is pretty complicated I remember there was a big case
[5498.84 → 5509.08] in I think it was Ireland um where McDonald's could not prove the trademark towards big mac oh I remember
[5509.08 → 5513.24] this because there was already a restaurant or something that was called big mac or
[5513.24 → 5519.40] something like that max that had been there for you know longer than McDonald's had been ever, ever yeah
[5521.48 → 5527.32] so even doing that type of global trademark across the country is not possible copyright and trademark is
[5527.32 → 5536.20] just such a complicated mess um it's why we have a tech sack instead of an uh yeah a tech other word
[5536.20 → 5540.12] yeah the little sack that we have that you can put tech in
[5541.72 → 5545.08] uh but yeah I just don't I don't like if you want to get really meta
[5545.88 → 5549.08] we just change the name I mean the shirts that you're wearing you know
[5549.08 → 5555.08] no, no lets not talk about that lets talk instead about this message from j21234
[5555.80 → 5562.04] um they pointed out that how can you have a certificate of authenticity this is from the
[5562.04 → 5567.72] float plane chat that is signed by some guy who just like changes his signature whenever he feels like it
[5567.72 → 5573.16] I will say both of those look real they are definitely both by my hand yeah but I have
[5573.16 → 5581.56] now that I sign more stuff I have changed to this yeah yeah um this takes too long yeah that's that's
[5581.56 → 5589.08] all I have to say about that sorry I can't believe you got by the way the Lamb beanie and the Lamb
[5589.64 → 5594.76] hot potato hoodie incredibly small amount of people accomplish that uh one probably I don't know i
[5594.76 → 5599.32] wouldn't be surprised this looks well-worn dude this looks like they have been enjoying that 70
[5599.32 → 5605.48] dollar that's a toque a loss of us-based AI tech would cripple medical and scientific research if
[5605.48 → 5609.72] we have to continue with old method methods while other countries research with AI tools
[5609.72 → 5616.04] our state and federal governments have started a ban on foreign pieces of software yeah I mean this is what
[5616.04 → 5621.88] I'm talking about this is what I'm saying you're just making yourself lose, but then that doesn't feel
[5621.88 → 5626.92] good because it doesn't feel like justice because a ton of people were just ripped off yeah uh to the
[5626.92 → 5631.48] the tune of what should probably be billions of dollars yeah, and they'll almost certainly never
[5631.48 → 5637.32] see anything for it which is like clearly not okay yeah and I mean realistically we're going to end up
[5637.32 → 5642.52] embroiled in controversy when people are asking four years from now why we didn't raise the alarm about
[5642.52 → 5649.56] this we know yeah we knew that AI was this one group knew why didn't they do anything about
[5649.56 → 5652.84] it why didn't we why didn't we stop why did they only talk about it on their live show
[5652.84 → 5657.80] not everybody watches that Luke jerks not everybody watches that
[5660.28 → 5665.24] uh but yeah I don't know it's uh it's weird it's very uncomfortable honestly to think about
[5665.24 → 5670.84] it doesn't feel good either I don't think there's a feel-good answer here um it's do the thing that
[5670.84 → 5680.68] feels right and lose as a nation as a country as a society or do the right thing and fade into
[5680.68 → 5688.04] the dustbin of history yeah essentially or do the wrong thing and try to stay on top so do we do
[5688.04 → 5693.56] the wrong thing for the right reasons do the ends justify the means go quick but that's yeah I mean
[5694.12 → 5700.28] summarize a thousand years of philosophy and uh one soundbite yeah sick good luck with that
[5701.88 → 5708.52] um be excellent to each other thanks luke agrees with stealing from others oh god
[5708.52 → 5719.72] I do not Amtrak demonstrates great taste encouraging CRT use on their trains and our source for this is
[5720.52 → 5728.76] Amtrak um no need to hit pause when you ride with Amtrak remember the blissful rush of playing your
[5728.76 → 5733.80] Nintendo Switch in the back seat of the car racing to snag one last power up before the battery ran out
[5733.80 → 5738.12] not a care in the world as someone else took care of the driving well there's good news the
[5738.12 → 5742.92] technological wizards at Amtrak have created a sort of time machine that simulates this experience
[5742.92 → 5747.88] but now there's no parental figure threatening to turn the car around and take away your gaming device
[5748.44 → 5752.04] with plenty of power outlets for your gaming devices complementary Wi-Fi loads available space
[5752.04 → 5755.32] between you and your sticky fingered siblings and overhead storage you can access anytime there's no
[5755.32 → 5760.84] better way to keep the gaming lights on than train travel so go ahead and bring that extra CRT
[5760.84 → 5766.36] for the smash melee tournament or an entire dual screen monitor setup you would be far from the first
[5768.28 → 5775.00] I almost want to like to challenge them on this oh my goodness this is amazing this is the actual Amtrak
[5775.56 → 5781.96] website that dude had an Amtrak branded DS by the way right that was wild what the heck what are we
[5781.96 → 5789.08] even looking at here this is so based you should do it you should also land on a train
[5789.08 → 5791.08] fast lander
[5795.08 → 5796.52] the fastest land party
[5796.52 → 5802.52] the fastest terrestrial land party what plane chat wants us to take the riot no
[5803.40 → 5811.40] definitely not tech train you can get a train car people used to didn't like really rich people used
[5811.40 → 5815.80] to do that lots of people have been talking about that today really yeah you could get a train car
[5815.80 → 5822.76] there's like I do not know a guy reasonable track in bc you don't know a guy I don't know a guy for
[5822.76 → 5828.60] trains I'm sorry well then we can't do it then we can't do it actually don't move forward unless
[5828.60 → 5833.08] Dan knows the guy I feel like by the end I'm sure I could find a guy that has a guy you'll know a guy
[5833.08 → 5837.96] yeah I'll ask around I'll ask my guys someone will get in touch with us dude imagine a train I think you
[5837.96 → 5843.40] have to pay for the tracks train car well yeah I would assume so I mean like that's the tracks well
[5843.40 → 5849.24] yeah track time like you'd have to because the tracks are owned by people, and you have to pay for
[5849.24 → 5853.96] them it's kind of sucks but this like used to be a thing there's got to be some amount of framework
[5854.76 → 5859.32] um I don't think it's a thing any more just because something was a thing at some point I mean I don't
[5859.32 → 5865.32] think I could find an ice harvester to bring me ice to store in my cave so that I can keep my
[5865.32 → 5872.36] vegetables chili like I know of one oh I got a guy to do you need a contact I don't need an ice
[5872.36 → 5877.80] harvesting contact they're selling glacier ice they're shipping it from Greenland to Dubai
[5880.68 → 5887.88] that is just so believable no it's true yeah I don't like current year at all I never have
[5887.88 → 5894.92] I want to go back to monkey I don't want to do this anymore
[5897.64 → 5902.60] uh also in the float plane chat grilling asked hey Linus have you read the feedback on the sponsor
[5902.60 → 5908.04] spots in the Chinese pcs video yes, and we have actually removed uh significant chunks of it uh
[5908.04 → 5912.04] with the YouTube editor, so thank you for your feedback and I have passed that along to the business
[5912.04 → 5919.88] team, and we have dialled it back thank you um I agree that it was too much um do you want to do
[5919.88 → 5923.56] oh there's literally nothing left for you why don't you do a couple merch messages because i have to run
[5923.56 → 5928.20] to the washroom, and then we're going to talk about a company that reached out to me that actually had
[5928.20 → 5938.20] a very cool it's cool oh okay, okay okay interesting you got anything for me dude I do actually I've got a
[5938.20 → 5942.44] couple here sorry I'm still going through some of the backlog though because they didn't reach out
[5942.44 → 5947.00] to him, they reached out to me oh and I was like he was just lying I have no idea what this is I'm
[5947.00 → 5955.56] going to pass this far uh Luke have you tried creatine ever since I have uh started it my recovery time is
[5955.56 → 5961.72] almost nothing I've been using it beyond raw for about a year, and it's been great yeah uh I even i
[5961.72 → 5970.44] technically double dose it based off of some advice I got uh so I take is it milligrams
[5970.44 → 5975.48] grams something like that usually you're supposed to take five of whatever it is and I take ten five
[5975.48 → 5983.08] grams ten grams yeah um yeah I like it seems good I feel like not everyone is a responder to it um
[5984.20 → 5991.24] I feel like I am I think I actually am that's the only form of anything that I take I did the 20
[5991.24 → 5997.72] gram loading and that was a mistake see I do that and I have no problems at all I'll like
[5997.72 → 6002.60] forget to take it for a week and then load again and nothing doesn't bother me at all i I double dose
[6002.60 → 6007.56] it every day no issues whatsoever uh do you like to drink it all in one sitting or do you take it over
[6007.56 → 6016.60] the entire day oh yeah it's just boom fire back um I am weak confirmed yeah it's just I mean no
[6016.60 → 6022.28] it's an it's a stomach thing some people are some people respond very negatively to it but still gain
[6022.28 → 6027.24] the benefits some people don't gain the benefits some people do gain the benefits and I seem to not
[6027.24 → 6035.48] respond quickly to it and uh do gain the benefits so sorry not respond negatively to it and do the
[6035.48 → 6041.64] benefits I tried again more recently and that ended up being okay promoting personal fitness isn't very
[6041.64 → 6047.24] Canadian what what what are you talking about boosted
[6049.40 → 6059.16] what I don't know okay I've got another one uh this is a body break a little bit more general Mr tips
[6059.16 → 6068.04] bird man av club what's your memorable Valentine's Day faux pas yeah fox pass
[6068.04 → 6071.00] for the Americans
[6074.44 → 6081.80] faux pas am I remembering how that works right somebody did a little uh social Sophie yeah
[6088.44 → 6093.80] I don't know I can't, I don't really care nobody's ever did in like uh
[6093.80 → 6100.60] uh in embarrassing for a Valentine's Day for me yeah or something you know about maybe I don't
[6100.60 → 6106.28] know uh I mean usually not to be all traditional about this but usually I feel like it's me doing
[6106.28 → 6114.36] things that make sense not the other way around um not that I'm against that I just think that's
[6114.36 → 6120.60] normally how that has gone in my history um I don't know
[6122.92 → 6130.76] I don't know forgetting that's a really boring answer that's a pretty big faux pas uh let's see
[6130.76 → 6134.20] if I have anything here in incoming for you um
[6134.20 → 6142.84] um I'm going to left me a little note in my lunch today that was cute I like that that's adorable
[6142.84 → 6147.64] that's not a faux pas though that was good um hey DLL what's your opinion and thoughts on the
[6147.64 → 6153.08] insignia digits upcoming product do you believe it'll be popular Luke here's a chance to talk about AI
[6153.08 → 6159.72] oh we did it yeah uh I mean we've been talking about doing something in the office I've put
[6159.72 → 6166.52] together a little super group of AI nerds um, and we've we've been discussing
[6167.48 → 6171.80] what we should do because we want to have something in-house uh that people can use not
[6171.80 → 6178.52] only just for like inline IDE assistance for the developers but also um just to like to get people more
[6178.52 → 6183.80] interested in it, I think like where I'm at right now with AI I've talked about a fair bit on the
[6183.80 → 6191.24] show I think a lot of people misuse it or like oh I think it's maybe a little
[6193.56 → 6194.76] I don't know if this is fair to say
[6197.00 → 6201.88] but like i I don't know I'm sure other people feel this way too but like i I feel like I use it
[6201.88 → 6207.80] in a way that is good and that a lot of other people don't use it like a tool how lame is that to
[6207.80 → 6213.72] say very self-centred um but yeah like i one use case that I've described to a lot of people
[6213.72 → 6219.96] is that I don't use it to write things for me effectively ever what I do get it to do is get
[6219.96 → 6224.04] it to try to interpret the things that I've written um because I've noticed you know over
[6224.04 → 6228.92] time some massive percentage of communication is body language and a lot of business and just
[6228.92 → 6234.76] communication in general is moving to text so someone said the exact words sentiment analysis those
[6234.76 → 6239.40] are my keywords I have different various prompts that I use with that but if I'm sending a message
[6239.40 → 6244.92] to someone especially if it's a serious one um and i you know have the time to iterate through it, I'll
[6245.56 → 6251.88] write the message up slap it in their ask it for a sentiment analysis, and then you know I might tweak it
[6251.88 → 6256.92] from there based on what it says and I might even ask it like wow what would you change to try to like
[6256.92 → 6265.80] you know shift this to be a little bit more friendly or whatever um and I might integrate its ideas but
[6265.80 → 6272.20] in general uh I don't actually have it right for me and I think using it in that way taking that type of
[6272.20 → 6280.60] thing and Grammarly does that cool I don't care use Grammarly anyway um using it in this type of way
[6280.60 → 6287.72] where you're like you're not you're not taking its output and submitting its output that's where almost
[6287.72 → 6297.64] all the issues I have found with it lie are when people are uh creating a result and just submitting
[6297.64 → 6304.28] that result if you use it to do some of the steps for you if you use it as a sounding board if you use
[6304.28 → 6309.32] it as a form of thinking, but then you check what it says and you verify, and you move from there
[6309.32 → 6313.16] and you use it as a research tool and stuff like that, but it's not outputting the thing that you're
[6313.16 → 6319.08] submitting, and you're checking the stuff that it's saying you can get a lot of benefit from it like
[6319.08 → 6325.00] an actually a sounding board Elijah we've already established this you're effectively a boomer now
[6325.00 → 6332.28] you don't get to do that any more it's over I'm sorry um but yeah I don't know how do you use it Dan
[6332.28 → 6341.64] um i kind of don't really I don't I don't use it at work I don't really use it for much um I don't
[6341.64 → 6348.04] know if that's a problem or not I have just never really found a need that much sometimes I will ask
[6348.04 → 6356.52] it some very specific questions about which word I'm thinking of um oh, but it's just like a dictionary
[6356.52 → 6364.44] thing I'm more interested in like how they function um yeah I don't know think less of me for that
[6365.00 → 6372.28] okay I mean i I missed all of it but i I assume that's a valid it was like usage of AI tools do
[6372.28 → 6379.16] you use any AI stuff ever not really no weak I don't I don't have a use for it um not at the moment
[6379.16 → 6385.48] I think you could, I think so too um I think a lot of people could I think it's just not in people's
[6385.48 → 6393.16] habits yet um I would expect it to be in mine i just I find I don't know we often forget about it
[6393.16 → 6399.64] and then when I'm like oh yeah I should like use this stuff I do I'm a little bit faster sometimes i
[6399.64 → 6404.84] like your idea of using it for sentiment analysis yeah I think maybe because sometimes I'll sit there
[6404.84 → 6409.72] and think about things and rewrite things myself right and that can take a while sometimes you do
[6409.72 → 6414.28] more of that than I do that's fair but I feel like you could ask about some of the stuff that you do
[6414.28 → 6420.28] and it might be able to help maybe it might also suck a lot yeah I don't think the stuff that I'm doing
[6420.28 → 6425.24] now it can help with you don't think it knows stuff about, although it could probably definitely help
[6425.24 → 6433.48] me with JavaScript stuff no but JavaScript yeah it could probably and Jason parsing and API
[6433.48 → 6441.00] oh I asked it how the hell the Microsoft API works because the SharePoint API is one of the worst
[6441.00 → 6447.88] things um I have ever encountered I remember that brief period of time that we were looking to like
[6447.88 → 6452.60] maybe the whole company should use SharePoint, and then we started looking to SharePoint all we're like
[6452.60 → 6456.28] maybe not maybe that's a no
[6456.28 → 6467.96] uh, so this is pretty cool uh remember that um that sport camera company that you linked me up with
[6467.96 → 6472.92] I mean that was like this week or last week so yeah yeah I mean I don't know what you do or don't
[6472.92 → 6480.52] remember um so it's called play site and they handle a lot of different courts a lot of different
[6480.52 → 6486.20] courts a lot of different sports but one of the things that they've apparently done really well in
[6486.20 → 6492.28] is pickleball clubs uh this is not pickleball I believe that's panel that's not pickleball either
[6492.28 → 6498.84] this is also not picking ball thank you for that neither is that anyway the point is that
[6499.88 → 6506.12] these guys actually seem like they might be a lot more legit than I thought I'd never heard of them
[6506.12 → 6513.80] like I know you know Hawkeye and I know um I assumed that you know most major sports just kind of
[6513.80 → 6522.92] like had their own setup or whatever, but apparently these guys are into video streaming um instant
[6522.92 → 6532.12] replay um coaching and like strategy analysis um particularly they apparently do really well in
[6532.12 → 6539.08] coaching uh automated production um they're they're in a like whack ton of different sports well the
[6539.08 → 6543.80] main the main reason why it took me a while to get them to you is because I was going back and forth
[6543.80 → 6549.80] with them for a while because they don't list badminton well so yeah they don't because nobody really
[6549.80 → 6555.24] cares about badminton in North America yeah sort of except that as we discussed on the call with them
[6555.24 → 6562.60] it's growing really fast yes um so he was kind of telling me that where a lot of their business comes
[6562.60 → 6567.64] from is so I got on a call with the rep, and he says yeah a lot of facilities just they put in
[6567.64 → 6573.56] security cameras, and then they start getting players coming up to the front desk being like oh man I like
[6573.56 → 6578.60] made like an epic save on that shot camera footage can you get me the security camera footage and they
[6578.60 → 6584.12] were like so that's one of the things that we do a perfect job of is you could just put a QR code
[6584.12 → 6589.80] on the side of the court people could just scan the QR code go into their app, and then they can
[6589.80 → 6594.84] download um you know the last 30 seconds or whatever of the match they can also apparently
[6594.84 → 6599.40] do instant replay whether you use it for line calls or whether you use it just for like I don't know
[6599.40 → 6605.08] just like doing an epic instant replay um that's apparently something that they work on, and it could
[6605.08 → 6608.84] be kind of sick if there's like a screen on the court, or maybe you just use your phone and like if
[6608.84 → 6614.04] there's a dispute you can just watch it back, and we're set up for that so we have power and Ethernet
[6614.28 → 6621.32] between every single court with that we put there because we intended to have whether it was for
[6621.32 → 6624.52] score keeping or whether it was for instant replay or whether it was for whatever else
[6625.16 → 6631.56] um we have networking we have power throughout the facility um and the way that it works is it's a
[6631.56 → 6637.88] charge per camera and then basically it's a charge per camera per year and you have to lock in for a
[6637.88 → 6642.76] term but I didn't realize how big these guys are apparently they have thousands of clubs guys is there
[6642.76 → 6648.44] anyone in chat anyone in float plane chat that has used play site before like in a
[6648.44 → 6656.20] facility or for coaching or training or for a stream uh l toward asks can you do local compute
[6656.68 → 6665.32] um I doubt it given the specs of the on-site server that they gave me however from my understanding
[6665.32 → 6674.52] basically everything is ramp or RTS and if we wanted to also do some like machine vision analysis
[6675.64 → 6682.36] on that video data nothing would prevent us from multicasting it to their thing and to a completely
[6682.36 → 6688.60] separate thing um Dan feel free to correct me if what I'm saying is stupid
[6688.60 → 6696.92] what does that mean he hasn't been listening that's what I mean when do i uh when do i not
[6696.92 → 6703.96] uh all right fair enough um he's trying to respond to merch messages yes he's trying to do his job see
[6703.96 → 6709.24] yeah nobody here is nobody here has apparently used it, but these guys say they're in thousands of clubs
[6709.24 → 6714.60] so I would think at least you know okay fine you know what I'm leaving I'm leaving the confines of
[6714.60 → 6720.60] float plane chat and I'm going to YouTube chat to see if anyone here has ever seen this no nobodies
[6720.60 → 6724.76] nobody's seen this nobody's heard of this they're talking about SharePoint still apparently still
[6725.40 → 6729.32] god yeah SharePoint's awful yeah the second I said that about SharePoint I was like and there's gonna
[6729.32 → 6737.80] be people fighting all right well brilliant apparently you can um like you can paywall matches or
[6737.80 → 6741.80] tournaments so if you have like a major tournament or something then that can be a revenue source if
[6741.80 → 6747.88] people want to watch it um I find this to be i I don't I don't want to piss him off but here one
[6747.88 → 6754.12] sec oh what now just a little website thing that annoys me um okay I'm on their website I scroll
[6754.12 → 6762.28] down scroll oh there's a footer never mind scroll down oh there's a footer never mind scroll down
[6763.32 → 6768.76] is this their blog there's a footer never mind uh media it's their media page oh okay brilliant
[6768.76 → 6772.92] yeah I was like actually trying to click something down there I was like ah come on
[6774.92 → 6778.68] rice says I think there's a very small overlap between tech people and badminton people we're
[6778.68 → 6783.16] not talking badminton people though they do like baseball and any sport they have so many
[6783.16 → 6787.40] sports yeah there's like a ton of sports, and they have like real footage of people playing those sports
[6787.40 → 6793.88] at what appears to be a reasonably high level so think about how many arenas and clubs and stuff
[6793.88 → 6798.68] there is just in the states alone though oh yeah no for sure thousands they're not saying tens of
[6798.68 → 6805.16] thousands just the high schools yeah, yeah pal hits says I think his point still stands
[6806.92 → 6813.56] what point the overlap between athlete people and tech people I mean come on let's give ourselves
[6813.56 → 6818.52] some credit people do Marquez not count yeah exactly that's what I'm talking about you play badminton a
[6818.52 → 6824.12] lot yeah I used to do many a sport yeah I used to you know he used to back in the day back in
[6824.12 → 6830.84] my day back in his day dude uh we played this game called we played this game called the voting game
[6830.84 → 6836.76] have you heard of it I don't know whatever one of Yvonne's friends bought it on Temu or something
[6836.76 → 6845.24] um basically it just is full of cards that make a statement and then everyone is holding a number and
[6845.24 → 6849.40] they play that number anonymously and the number corresponds to someone around the table that
[6849.40 → 6856.20] they think matches the statement and one of the statements was they peaked in high school
[6858.84 → 6866.20] I'd probably get a few of those yeah anyway um it ended up being a very hurtful game I'm sure overall
[6866.20 → 6876.84] yeah yeah um i got um yeah what were yours that uh I was oh had um gives awkward hugs really was
[6876.84 → 6882.12] mine and um Yvonne voted for me
[6886.52 → 6893.64] my own wife that's rough voted for me forgives awkward hugs that's she clarified she didn't she was
[6893.64 → 6900.04] like no I don't mean in like a like creepy weird way I mean in like uh you don't like touching people
[6900.60 → 6906.52] and so it's kind of awkward when you touch people away I mean that lines up thanks I've known you for
[6906.52 → 6913.80] like 15 years I think we've hugged twice yeah that sounds about right name them yeah that sounds about
[6913.80 → 6921.00] right yeah I'm not I'm not much of an I'm not much of a physical contact guy yeah in general so when people
[6921.00 → 6927.40] started the like elbow bump thing at conventions when people yo dude that's that's like my line now
[6927.40 → 6932.04] when people like are taken aback by the fist bump I'm like dude look I was a germaphobe way before it
[6932.04 → 6940.04] was cool no um so when people like to go in for the hug I'm like I don't know whether my arm
[6940.04 → 6947.40] goes this way my arm goes this way I'm also like kind of a weird height because for a lot of men I'm like
[6947.40 → 6951.64] like in their shoulder probably have to like go like to go like this to like
[6952.84 → 6958.92] anyway um I'm trying to think if there's any other ones that were really uncomfortable but there were
[6958.92 → 6966.84] definitely uh oh, oh yeah one of them was um spends too much time maintaining their image on social media
[6966.84 → 6971.40] okay well of course I got voted obvious of course did anyone else get a vote other than you
[6971.40 → 6979.08] uh yes wow they were one of the moms' oh yeah okay because the thing is honestly and i actually
[6979.08 → 6985.40] maintained that that was the correct answer because I spend would you call anything that I do curate
[6985.40 → 6994.36] my image please yeah all of it you have staff curating see and the question specifically was that i
[6994.36 → 6999.72] spend a ton of my time doing it he spends the time undoing everything that everyone else tries to do
[7002.36 → 7009.32] this guy gets it see he's like anti that mom someone in chat called one of the two times by the way oh
[7009.88 → 7019.32] oh where is it Euro identified it because one of the two times was at the roast oh yeah yeah yeah and then
[7019.32 → 7027.48] the other two time with the other time was when you tried to quit oh okay three okay, okay I'm missing
[7027.48 → 7033.48] one the the the 10-year plaque oh yeah yeah that checks out that checks out the 10-year
[7033.48 → 7039.40] service award presentation yeah wow that is uh you know what though that makes them special yeah
[7040.20 → 7045.40] they really count I don't care to be clear just in case anyone's like oh like no i i I genuinely don't
[7045.40 → 7049.88] they really count okay brown stein says come on Linus everyone knows right arm goes up left arm goes
[7049.88 → 7058.28] down and I didn't know that I don't hug people is that a thing I think so is it one of those things
[7058.28 → 7062.28] know the rule but I think so is it one of those things like which side of the sidewalk you walk on
[7062.28 → 7067.80] where it depends what country you're in oh maybe if I'm in Australia or if I'm in the UK do I go left
[7067.80 → 7075.80] arm up I don't know maybe people are saying I didn't know that he made that up yeah no okay no
[7075.80 → 7081.16] I don't I go over the top with both arms says boosted well I wish you'd been there for the game
[7081.16 → 7086.68] because then I wouldn't have had to win that one that's definitely awkward did you want anything else
[7087.48 → 7093.72] uh oh a ton of stuff I don't really remember a lot of it that's fair uh let me see let me see
[7093.72 → 7098.52] the less impactful ones my wife can remember anything I definitely got roasted as much if
[7098.52 → 7105.88] not more than anyone else that much is certainly for sure that makes sense hey, hey wife you're live
[7105.88 → 7113.56] on the wan show can I uh ask you a quick question yeah uh you sound in the middle of something oh I am
[7113.56 → 7118.92] but what's up um hey when we were playing the voting game can you remember any of the awful ones that i
[7118.92 → 7129.32] got voted for other than the awkward hug one oh man um I think you got voted for like who was
[7130.20 → 7137.48] the one that took the most recent selfie oh yeah I did win that one um okay in fairness to me though
[7137.48 → 7143.88] there was a very good reason for taking if it was like a no it was I was on set and I was testing selfie
[7143.88 → 7148.36] cameras compared to my daily driver phone like it wasn't because I was all like at the club and I was like
[7148.92 → 7155.48] like I come on I don't I don't know I don't know if that really counts that much you also got voted
[7155.48 → 7161.16] for like who was most likely to yell at you for putting garbage and recycling or recycling garbage
[7161.16 → 7167.80] or something like that yeah I won that one yeah I could see that uh okay you know what I think we're
[7167.80 → 7174.28] gonna this is a good conversation thank you very much um I'll see you soon hon okay bye bye
[7174.28 → 7180.28] uh yeah I got vote i and the reason that I won that one was because the last time one of those
[7180.28 → 7185.64] people was over i like moved with some stuff that they had put away after they left it like
[7185.64 → 7194.52] started resorting it i am not like I'm not militant about it or anything like that for me, it's more
[7194.52 → 7203.16] just that sometimes it really is no more work at all to do it properly so in those cases where it is
[7203.16 → 7209.56] literally not more work at all oh no um I don't know it just seems like not more work to put it in the
[7209.56 → 7215.88] right thing and i definitely garbage and recycling I'm a little less fussy about but when it comes to
[7215.88 → 7219.80] organics in the garbage I actually do legitimately get kind of upset about that
[7219.80 → 7229.96] oh that doesn't count yeah um like come on don't put organic stuff in the garbage i I had this um
[7230.92 → 7235.00] I had this book when I was a kid it was super cool I've never been able to find it again it must have
[7235.00 → 7242.28] been like a really limited print, but it was called um it had an aluminum cover and one of the first
[7242.28 → 7247.32] article or one of the first chapters in it was like explaining it, or maybe it wasn't one of the first but
[7247.32 → 7252.84] somewhere in it is explained the process of like recycling aluminum and how the cover was I had
[7252.84 → 7257.64] gone through that process it was super cool um I really forget what it was called maybe like cabinet
[7257.64 → 7260.76] of curiosities maybe it was something else no I think that might have been a different book the
[7260.76 → 7264.28] point is it doesn't matter it sounds pretty sick though it um yeah it was a super cool like little
[7264.28 → 7271.16] physical demonstration yeah and one of the chapters in it was uh about the decomposition of organic
[7271.16 → 7277.96] material or rather the lack thereof in landfills because it becomes an anaerobic environment with no
[7277.96 → 7284.76] light you can dig a hot dog out of a landfill 20 years later, and it will like it had a picture of a
[7284.76 → 7291.08] hot dog that was like ancient, and it looked like you could just barbecue it and eat it like it was
[7291.08 → 7297.88] it was crazy um and so yeah definitely the design and engineering behind landfills is like actually
[7297.88 → 7302.92] surprisingly very interesting it gets me very upset though to see organic material thrown into
[7302.92 → 7309.72] the landfill when it could be composted, and you know reused but yeah anywho what are we supposed
[7309.72 → 7315.32] to be talking about no one cares about play site thing no one knows what the heck it is so
[7316.36 → 7320.76] apparently I have to commit to a multi-year term in order to like even yeah they don't have a trial
[7321.64 → 7327.80] unfortunately although I wonder if we BYO hardware uh if they might be able to make an exception
[7327.80 → 7331.40] on that because part of their whole deal is that they give you the cameras and the server
[7332.12 → 7339.56] and then you sign up for a multi-year deal if it just sucks well then I guess you should get good
[7339.56 → 7346.44] scrub do they realize that if it sucks they're probably going to get like dragged oh they had
[7346.44 → 7352.36] no idea who we were really yeah he was explaining to me about like the specs of their server and how
[7352.36 → 7356.84] it has all their technology and I was like dude don't tell me what technology is in a server please
[7358.52 → 7364.44] weird well remember too whoever like watches LTT is not necessarily going to be in their sales
[7364.44 → 7369.80] department that's another small overlap like sales people and people who watch LTT probably
[7369.80 → 7372.76] someone there knew, but that isn't the person who reached it yeah yeah yeah
[7375.32 → 7380.60] anyway AJ the the the feature that I think is the hardest to replicate would be like the tips
[7381.56 → 7385.16] because they give you like feedback on your gameplay don't they I doubt they would be able to do that
[7385.16 → 7390.76] for badminton given they don't even officially support the sport did uh I asked this the even
[7390.76 → 7396.76] the rep was like yeah we're looking to get into it yeah I knew they would just lie to get on a call
[7396.76 → 7404.36] that's so common honestly it still looks like it might be it might still be pretty good but AJ we have
[7404.36 → 7409.88] enough work to do I would really want to try it yeah yeah that too I think we're still
[7409.88 → 7413.64] I think we're still waiting on getting some of the other in for stuff they're like prepped for land
[7413.64 → 7418.44] parties and stuff like I don't think we're anywhere near getting all the cameras hooked up
[7418.44 → 7424.60] uh Dan and I are still going back and forth on what cameras we want to use um yeah requirements are
[7424.60 → 7432.36] changing I think oh no, no like from original like we discussed this the other day yeah I mean I don't
[7432.36 → 7436.44] know if they've changed since the original requirements it's just the camera that I found
[7436.44 → 7442.12] that I really liked that met all of my requirements Dan found that their implementation of ramp was really
[7442.12 → 7446.68] bad it was really disappointing, but we might be able to still use it no AJ
[7446.68 → 7454.92] let AJ cook no we don't want to do badminton video mass ingest and distribution through
[7454.92 → 7463.64] float plane no, no we really don't it can't be that hard he says no, no we're just going to stream for free
[7463.64 → 7475.56] on twitch and uh i was going to make that reference he beat me to it uh okay I think it's time for
[7475.56 → 7480.68] after dark okay sick so we have a new thing, and it's at the bottom of the dock where you have to
[7480.68 → 7485.80] read about the float plane announcements now oh yeah what's that where's that at the right
[7485.80 → 7491.96] above sponsors right below the last watch video okay I can watch a video oh my god well this is off to
[7491.96 → 7498.84] a good start oh I guess we're going to need audio this automatically looks amazing I am so excited
[7498.84 → 7503.48] are you ready Dan I think so oh
[7505.32 → 7507.32] oh
[7509.64 → 7510.52] oh yes
[7511.48 → 7513.40] here we go get him so screwed in
[7516.68 → 7522.92] it's perfect it's alive oh my god, and it's Alex with a clone float plane get subscribed here's the
[7522.92 → 7528.60] preview what is the line in your opinion between Jacky and stupid if it plays well and is amusing
[7528.60 → 7535.40] in a video then it's Jacky I have a 21-inch concert speaker that we got in for a while ago it would be
[7535.40 → 7540.76] hilarious to put it in the back of Linus's van I suspect that it would be large and powerful enough
[7540.76 → 7542.52] to literally blow the windows
[7545.64 → 7546.68] wow that was great
[7550.44 → 7552.04] please put in guitar sounds there Sammy
[7554.20 → 7558.76] instructions on that intro was genuinely amazing he said it was his magnum opus
[7558.76 → 7564.92] that's actually so good 10 out of 10 good jobs not only was the concept great but Alex killed that
[7564.92 → 7570.92] that was hype fantastic we will have three separate videos dedicated to Alex as you saw in the trailer
[7570.92 → 7580.12] so make sure to subscribe at leg.GG alex25 that was so good those are all coming very soon and is
[7580.12 → 7585.80] this Alex at the top of the thing yeah okay that makes sense I can oh he's in the's in the icon too
[7585.80 → 7591.16] I can barely even recognize him there okay that's a little more that's more recognizable this is this
[7591.16 → 7597.24] is uncomfortable yeah I think so he's been doing that for a bit yeah okay good stuff the sparking
[7597.24 → 7604.36] paintbrush is absolutely aced here amazing uh all right Dan time for after dark sure let me get
[7604.36 → 7610.20] us switched over here dude I don't remember the last time we launched an apparel product
[7610.92 → 7614.92] that resonated like this has been spicy yeah
[7616.92 → 7620.36] poor Dan still has 15 messages and incoming
[7622.04 → 7624.92] I am just about done with them sheesh
[7627.08 → 7632.44] is it dividing up like who do we have like uh oh I can voting with their wallet yeah like what's
[7632.44 → 7638.04] winning yeah oh we should definitely guess before I look it up though okay uh okay hold on
[7638.04 → 7641.80] let me just get the dashboard open so that people aren't going to have to wait too long you have to do
[7641.80 → 7647.88] rank ranks voting rankless voting oh my goodness okay yeah i can do that no, no I'm just I'm just
[7647.88 → 7653.24] saying like oh I thought with us three yeah uh yeah no we should do rank choice voting yeah yeah
[7653.24 → 7657.88] for which or no we should just have to no we should well we should just say what we think our podium is
[7658.52 → 7663.88] okay yeah that's what I'm saying oh sure sure okay uh and are we guessing are we saying which
[7663.88 → 7668.36] one we like better and seeing if we agree with the community or are we guessing which one sold better
[7669.40 → 7675.48] I'm honestly I think I'm doing both you're going to do both oh, and you think it'll be the same you believe
[7676.12 → 7682.52] you believe that our community's tastes will be perfectly aligned with your own yep me to pipe pipe
[7682.52 → 7689.88] interesting okay, okay okay, okay okay so everyone okay zip it we all have you written it
[7689.88 → 7695.32] down I wrote it down you're done already okay, okay so and i to be clear they're all amazing
[7697.40 → 7702.84] they're all great yeah dude you have to do the thing I wrote here in that one what you're not going to give

[7708.84 → 7718.44] yes he gets a ding you get a ding I'm sorry Luke okay, okay so we all reveal our our our guesses uh
[7718.44 → 7728.84] let's have Dan go first I'm going with pipe doors maze okay pipe doors maze you differ okay
[7728.84 → 7737.56] so hold on dan is pipe doors I could see that being correct okay mine differs and Luke is doors pipes maze
[7738.84 → 7748.20] and uh in a massive surprise to everyone doors by space I live in Luke's head apparently
[7748.76 → 7753.96] uh wait did you write down what you thought I was going to say no oh okay no i just we just I don't know
[7753.96 → 7758.84] it's like we just we order the same thing that restaurants that does happen it's a whole thing
[7758.84 → 7763.40] you know I've literally had people ask me what I'm gonna order at a restaurant before knowing that
[7763.40 → 7768.28] Linus is ordered first and without looking at the menu I'll just whatever line has got I'm sure it's fine
[7768.28 → 7776.68] and it's literally always been fine I'm a very safe food order that is probably part of it that
[7776.68 → 7781.00] is fair I tend to just go with like I don't know what's a bowl that just like everything in it is
[7781.00 → 7787.24] sort of universally believed to be delicious I'll just go with that it's a pretty good approach soup is
[7787.88 → 7793.80] so underrated it bothers me it can be a little hit or miss though there's either top tier or
[7793.80 → 7799.96] absolutely but I don't think it's that hard to make perfect soup no but would you go to a
[7799.96 → 7805.16] restaurant and order soup I have oh yeah sure like french good french onion good french onion
[7805.16 → 7814.20] soup yes please clam chowder dude okay um it can also be horrible though I don't really do a lot of
[7814.20 → 7823.72] fish anyway so I wouldn't know both amazing okay all right 18 results
[7826.20 → 7832.04] oh man this is broken down by uh size bloody hell no, no I think I can, I think I can work it out I think
[7832.04 → 7838.68] I can work it out oh I don't know if I can work it out oh no okay someone's going to have to do the math
[7838.68 → 7843.96] for me here uh do you want me to pull up the things and have a look okay no, no no, no no, no I got
[7843.96 → 7854.52] you I got you okay so the various sizes okay so doors you got this Luke I've got uh I've got six uh 23
[7855.72 → 7860.76] 24 29 35
[7860.76 → 7864.04] and 44
[7866.12 → 7870.12] okay for maize hold on no, no just we'll get all the numbers first we'll get all the numbers first
[7870.12 → 7876.04] because someone in chat will probably just do it for us anyway uh maize I've got one 14
[7877.80 → 7890.04] 14 17 17 17 18. Uh Dan I think oh no we all said that maize would be in last oh okay we did
[7890.04 → 7897.00] so now we just need uh doors pipes oh we need pipes which I gave you doors first okay pipes
[7897.00 → 7899.56] okay here comes pipes seven uh-oh
[7902.04 → 7916.60] 25 okay all right there we go 27 whoa 29 whoa 31 whoa, but it falls behind in the large size at 42
[7916.60 → 7925.16] 42 42 42 42 42 whoa no what it's the same they're dead they're tied
[7925.16 → 7929.24] shut up they're tied 161 we all lose
[7932.20 → 7939.32] that's no one is winners that's wild dang it nobody called that no, no hell um okay wow
[7939.32 → 7949.72] wow well that was fun okay tell me this incredible now normally and i that's a joke um because normal
[7949.72 → 7956.76] curve anyway the point is normally medium would be our uh would be our the peak of our bell
[7956.76 → 7966.20] curve if you had to guess would you say that this particular product skews more petite or more husky
[7966.20 → 7971.24] bigger bigger for sure bigger for sure average audience buying it would probably be older
[7973.88 → 7981.48] generally larger I have never seen anything skew this heavily large yeah uh large is number one
[7981.48 → 7987.96] followed very closely by extra large followed very closely by extra, extra large
[7987.96 → 7996.68] followed closely by medium followed distantly by small yeah all of them are like bigger bodybuilders
[7996.68 → 8003.48] than Luke because anybody that would buy this shirt would be just huge just chatted absolutely muscle
[8003.48 → 8004.20] bound chad
[8006.84 → 8014.28] or a short king one of the two yes uh anyway yeah pretty, pretty interesting so I guess we all get to be
[8014.28 → 8022.28] both wrong and right sort of is hum yeah great job everyone good work uh no trophies what else
[8022.28 → 8026.84] we got today uh oh more merch messages should we just get into some merch yeah hit me down that sound
[8027.56 → 8034.28] um let's see we already did that one hi LLD over the past years I've gotten many letters from
[8034.28 → 8038.92] healthcare providers telling me that I'm impacted by a data breach they all offer one to two years of
[8038.92 → 8050.04] credit monitoring should they be doing more yes yep, yep sorry we I don't have a ton to add credit
[8050.04 → 8054.92] monitoring doesn't even do that much it just tells you after the fact that something bad happened by the
[8054.92 → 8059.88] way if you haven't been checking your credit card statement or anything else yeah like um like and
[8059.88 → 8062.92] man TransUnion and Equifax and those guys like
[8066.28 → 8073.40] yucky industry by the way this is funny rift says this is peak large it guy needing to wear a
[8073.40 → 8080.52] collar for work but knowing he can't be fired oh this is uh this is cobalt programming club
[8083.00 → 8088.44] oh hey Linus hope your motorcycle is going well wondering if you have any wrecks for helmet or music
[8088.44 → 8093.24] call systems also possibility on some of the CarPlay systems or huts interesting bike tech out
[8093.24 → 8100.12] there I haven't ridden in over two years while I've been painting my bike I have made zero progress
[8100.12 → 8105.40] in the last week when I get back into it, I am somewhat interested in looking into some in helmet
[8105.40 → 8112.68] stuff but honestly the most advanced thing that I ever implemented was wired speakers that were
[8112.68 → 8117.96] just like little flat speakers that were ripped off of some cost headphones that i double-sided taped
[8117.96 → 8123.88] into my helmet and then just like cable managed down and then I plugged into a phone that was in
[8123.88 → 8129.00] my pocket with a three and a half millimetre jack and then I had a pebble smartphone uh hot glued to a
[8129.00 → 8135.64] magnet and then magneted onto the dash of my bike so that I could change the track that's as good as
[8135.64 → 8139.96] I ever got and then if I needed directions I would just use turn by turn which is really annoying when
[8139.96 → 8147.16] you're listening to music it sucks hey LLD with myself going to college this upcoming fall for
[8147.16 → 8152.68] computer and electrical engineering I wanted to ask what education got you interested into tech
[8152.68 → 8158.28] also big fan of the channel uh computer lab in school man playing that Dino park tycoon playing
[8158.28 → 8166.20] that math circus i I got into games extremely young and then most of my motivation for learning about
[8166.20 → 8173.08] computers was so that my games would run better yeah i I started my core interest in computers other
[8173.08 → 8178.36] than my dad just pushing me to be interested in it um was because I wanted to be able to play Diablo on
[8178.36 → 8184.28] land with my buddy um and I was like how does this work I need to something
[8184.28 → 8192.12] what are all these words why do they matter yeah and then yeah it was largely I want to be able i
[8192.12 → 8198.04] want to understand because you know money's tight uh I want to understand what upgrades are important
[8198.04 → 8204.92] so that I can keep playing new games as they come out stuff like that and then I had uh an affinity for
[8204.92 → 8212.12] it when I went to school so I joined that class and my computers' teacher was amazing so that helped a lot yeah
[8214.28 → 8222.12] you're hey LLD for Luke I hope you like that this will be used by our spacecraft systems engineering
[8222.12 → 8226.52] team to build small SATs and cube SATs what are some of your favourite missions that you have read
[8226.52 → 8235.16] about or driver or something oh they purchased a precision multi-bit and the case sick um this wouldn't
[8235.16 → 8242.28] necessarily be read about um that's so cool but i it's very cool yeah LTT precision driver working on like
[8242.28 → 8248.28] satellites is that sick right, and it's perfect for the cube sets because they're like pretty small
[8248.28 → 8261.48] it's like amazing that's so cool um project light sail oh my god I'm getting an ad for Aries tech
[8262.04 → 8262.92] oh no dude
[8262.92 → 8272.68] have we had this conversation on wan show before the one about like how far we'll come back to up
[8272.68 → 8277.96] an organization you have to go to reach the level where people know it's a grift
[8279.32 → 8285.00] you know because I do believe that there are people who work in that organization, or you know
[8285.56 → 8291.40] Scientology, or you know whatever right like surely l Ron Hubbard knew it was a grift
[8291.40 → 8296.68] and is like accountant must have known it was a grift you know sometimes you might just actually be
[8296.68 → 8303.80] crazy i I mean that is possible that's possible but i i I can't, I can't believe that about every
[8304.36 → 8309.80] grift organization for sure I can't believe that yeah so like I'm just saying like sometimes how far
[8309.80 → 8316.68] up and I think there's also probably like an I think there's also probably like a time
[8316.68 → 8322.20] element to this as well like if you look at you know tell yourself long enough or something well
[8322.20 → 8330.28] yeah like you look at some very large organizations in the world that have been around for a very long
[8330.28 → 8336.84] time accumulating vast amounts of wealth in the process you know at some point someone probably knew
[8336.84 → 8346.44] it was a grift yeah um and maybe that knowledge died out and people who were indoctrinated
[8346.44 → 8352.44] made their way up into the upper ranks and people and people no longer like know yeah um
[8353.40 → 8357.88] a person one two three in full plane chat said in quotes but I don't know if it's a quote or not
[8357.88 → 8362.68] uh never underestimate the ability of someone to not know something if their paycheck depends on it
[8362.68 → 8371.24] that sounds like there's a lot that sounds correct Luke yeah, thank you yeah so
[8375.48 → 8378.52] he's so smart how high I like my job
[8383.56 → 8388.60] okay sorry Linus I missed that and I'm probably glad I did yeah how high up do you have to go in
[8388.60 → 8394.84] an organization like airs tech for them to know it's a grift you think because i I do actually
[8394.84 → 8402.20] believe that some of the influencers like believe in 5g you know whatever radiation's killing plants or
[8402.20 → 8405.88] whatever right like there 's's certainly going to be some that do if you're not working on
[8407.64 → 8414.12] administrative teams or engineering teams at that company like when are you exposed to do it work or
[8414.12 → 8420.04] not yeah probably not that often because like the engineers would know I'm sure if they even have
[8420.04 → 8427.32] any like yeah, yeah right um and like the product designers I guess yeah the product designers would
[8427.32 → 8432.12] have to know because they'd have to know that they're just like you know drawing it there's a
[8432.12 → 8437.40] weird part of this job that I would expect we would be doing that we're not doing yeah uh yeah
[8438.68 → 8442.60] but beyond that like do you the people running their hilarious demos like do you think they're sales
[8442.60 → 8446.76] people and marketing people know it's a grift or do they just recruit the believers
[8449.80 → 8454.12] I'm sure there's an ability to recruit the believers there's also this concept of like
[8454.12 → 8460.36] you know if you tell yourself something enough you will start to believe it and if you believe
[8460.36 → 8466.68] something to a certain degree and people push you on it, and you just get defensive you can like
[8466.68 → 8471.08] build up a fortress of things that aren't necessarily true, but you might not necessarily even realize it
[8471.08 → 8477.48] right um there are a lot of weird things like uh human brains is funny I was talking to Emma
[8477.48 → 8482.52] about this the other day the fact that everyone just shrugs off the placebo effect is wild oh yeah
[8482.52 → 8488.76] placebo effect is huge like actually one of the most wild things ever like seriously one of the best
[8488.76 → 8494.92] things you can do if you like literally get cancer is to just believe that you're going to make it yeah
[8494.92 → 8503.32] like it's not a guarantee but the difference that it makes to survival rates to have a positive attitude
[8503.32 → 8512.36] and think you're going to beat something is wild yeah like wild I've also heard warts is a huge one if you
[8512.36 → 8516.76] just think about your wart going away that's like medical science at this point
[8516.76 → 8525.16] yeah yeah that's insane I don't know yeah that's like a real thing but like so many people
[8525.16 → 8530.36] will hear about placebo for the first time and just be like yeah it's like what there's also no
[8530.36 → 8536.52] Docebo you can't also talk about one without the other one the negative effects you think that this
[8536.52 → 8541.64] medication is going to hurt you, and then it actually hurts you yeah even if it doesn't even if it's
[8541.64 → 8546.92] placebo or fake you're just making up that it has negative side yeah exactly like you get more
[8546.92 → 8551.48] warts this is why real medical trials need controls and everything needs to be double-blind and all
[8551.48 → 8555.96] of that stuff I was telling Emma I'm really happy that people do research on this stuff and to a
[8555.96 → 8561.64] certain degree in certain cases I think it's probably beneficial for me to not know more right
[8562.68 → 8567.64] it's real witchcraft because like if I think it's gonna work once I get to that conclusion as long
[8567.64 → 8571.00] as I'm certain it's not going to like be really harmful for me, I don't want to know more
[8571.88 → 8576.84] yeah because if I think it's gonna work than okay cool and then if you find you know some
[8577.96 → 8582.44] it as like doctor YouTuber or something that's like yeah actually the whole thing's a grift
[8583.00 → 8587.88] then now it has no chance of working stops working yeah it might have been working it might have been
[8587.88 → 8592.92] working because you might and like that doesn't make Luke an idiot it just makes him a human being
[8592.92 → 8599.32] yeah we are this happens to all of us we are so and like no flawed all the time placebo effect doesn't just
[8599.32 → 8605.96] affect uh medicine stuff it affects your ability to perform in like sport in basically everything
[8605.96 → 8611.40] if you yeah it's its wild to remember when we were at the gym and I thought I was lifting 40 pounds
[8611.40 → 8617.32] because I can't do math this was nuts that has happened many times this was nuts he genuinely lifted
[8617.32 → 8625.24] like a lot more than his previous max and lifted it multiple times I did like a full PR set done
[8625.24 → 8629.40] that he had lifted like 20 pounds more than last time because I miscounted
[8630.68 → 8636.68] I forgot to include the bar and then like went up 45 pounds and was just like this is only five more
[8636.68 → 8642.12] and then just like benched it for eight we are recommending that no, no no, no we are not recommending
[8642.12 → 8647.00] that no oh I could have seriously hurt myself at all yeah, and we talked about that afterwards
[8647.00 → 8652.84] actually absolutely uh extremely dangerous, but it's just wild that his brain was
[8652.84 → 8657.40] like this is fine, and it's only 20 pounds, and then it just happened, and then he was just able to lift
[8657.40 → 8662.12] at that level moving forward because he now had evidence that he could, I mean the brain mind body
[8662.12 → 8667.96] connection is really, really important for lifting weights anyway um and so if I was just saying yeah I can
[8667.96 → 8675.16] lift this and then my body did wow uh mavsguy842 says that's why getting volunteers to work on your
[8675.16 → 8681.64] grift organization is awesome because then you know they believe in it and that makes the grift organization
[8681.64 → 8691.08] so much more powerful and so much more persuasive whoa that's awful that makes so much sense though oh yeah 100
[8691.08 → 8699.00] Porto says I hate the world yeah the world isn't the problem
[8701.88 → 8707.48] the world's got trees and things anyway talking about cool things someone asked me my favourite
[8707.48 → 8714.04] thing that I read about my favourite uh I don't know something to a space that I read about um and i
[8714.04 → 8720.52] what no, no carry on oh did I rip away I was showing it oh well here you go uh I contributed to this back in
[8720.52 → 8728.84] the day um, and it was super cool so you contributed to this what did you do yeah oh no money oh Geez okay
[8728.84 → 8734.12] I was not I was like what I was not functionally useful how have I never heard about this no, no no, no no
[8734.68 → 8741.88] um it was yeah a little I think it was a CubeSat technically little satellite and they
[8741.88 → 8748.44] they had this enormous sail that they put on it that unfolded when it got out there because technically light
[8748.44 → 8755.72] has momentum so that's why it's called light sail because they're using light as a propulsion right
[8755.72 → 8758.92] which is super cool yeah, and it totally wouldn't have worked unless they believed it would
[8760.44 → 8768.12] it's not actually how placebo effect works they're like the orcs from 40k yeah yeah but yeah it's a
[8768.12 → 8774.44] it's a planetary society thing i I thought and think it's super cool um there's a light sail too there's
[8774.44 → 8778.44] all this other kind of stuff I don't know I didn't really read a part that about that because I was
[8778.44 → 8782.52] I don't know I guess I did technically read about it anyway whatever what is going on what is this
[8782.52 → 8787.48] uh we're playing Dino park tycoon for the rest of the show why uh because it's a wonderful game
[8787.48 → 8794.36] you're getting eve ads based uh I need to I need to change the zoom just a time oh you know what we
[8794.36 → 8800.84] could just go uh buy land at the real estate office I could just go full screen uh hold on he said
[8800.84 → 8809.48] mocking the bc people is this a function one uh hello okay i why is what's the what's the bloody
[8809.48 → 8815.96] hockey for full screen f11 okay I'm pressing okay see Luke bear flight for me please I'm not an idiot
[8817.00 → 8820.04] yes is the function screwed up is it no it's not looked
[8821.88 → 8827.56] correct I don't okay all right cool so hit this, so there are three kebabs on the top right
[8827.56 → 8833.08] uh yeah I just don't know what's in there uh are we no longer playing it oh we're playing it
[8834.44 → 8839.32] on the right right right are the new shirts call friendly uh I'm I'm tall I'm not they're not
[8839.32 → 8843.16] tall, but it fits like this they're not tall size oh for
[8848.52 → 8852.20] yeah they're not tall sizing, but they're not really helps that it's short sleeve
[8852.20 → 8860.84] and they're reasonably tuckable I think yeah okay all right uh what else we got for um what else we got
[8860.84 → 8867.48] for Linus do you have a video favourite that you have made and look which scrapyard wars was your
[8867.48 → 8878.20] favourite four oh yeah that's the one with the fire yeah I don't think it's like even reasonable that
[8878.20 → 8885.32] there will be one that could ever trump that for me like overall uh like production quality
[8885.32 → 8890.44] and all that type of stuff I think the most recent one whatever number it was um is probably
[8890.44 → 8896.60] our best one, but four will always hold a special spot in my heart working with rod on that was like
[8897.72 → 8902.92] probably one of the highlights of working on computers like oh he's in chat no way um working
[8902.92 → 8906.68] with rod on that was sick that was like easily one of the coolest computers ever made
[8906.68 → 8910.68] um the fact that the power went out in the office, and we had to present at my parents house was just
[8910.68 → 8919.56] like sick um I don't know we made a computer that lit on freaking fire dude like what do you how do
[8919.56 → 8926.84] you even I don't, and it was like actually really cool like the integration of burlap the fact that we
[8926.84 → 8932.76] used an actual like old iron grill the fact that we had multiple types of fire we didn't just we didn't
[8932.76 → 8938.92] just settle with one form of fire um that would have been lame we had to have uh multiple sources
[8938.92 → 8944.68] of fire and multiple different types of fire um we had like the three two one rule of fire instead of
[8944.68 → 8951.64] backup um it was uh yeah it was uh it was really fun I had an I had like a genuinely just really
[8951.64 → 8958.36] good time um and I really liked the result that we ended with, and it's great and I'm always going to say four
[8958.36 → 8963.32] four is what it is hmm minus do you have a favourite video
[8966.44 → 8975.48] I like a favourite video like one favourite video overall yeah um look at those wages
[8977.64 → 8981.64] okay we're going to need a little bit of food uh oh crap what kind of food does this one eat
[8981.64 → 8991.08] can anybody explain NVIDIA does that every day is an amazing comment did no one else react to this
[8991.08 → 8998.28] what I'm talking about the fire computer and gm Sheba oh says NVIDIA does that every day
[9000.28 → 9011.08] you win got it I'm just upset now oh man oh okay well
[9012.60 → 9018.84] I don't know what the heck my dinosaur eats what is happening hey took shyness and when what was the
[9018.84 → 9025.08] last DIY tech project that made you excited, or you really enjoyed doing I recently had an arcade
[9025.08 → 9027.96] cabinet watching one of your old videos, and it was so much fun
[9033.24 → 9039.64] man when's the last what's the last like DIY tech project I did trying to think
[9041.64 → 9044.60] that's a very
[9044.60 → 9048.44] gm Sheba said I work on rockets and getting a ding is my proudest moment
[9049.72 → 9050.60] just for you bud
[9052.76 → 9053.56] that's brutal
[9053.56 → 9059.80] no, no it's its quite an honour to be perfectly honest oh
[9061.48 → 9066.92] we should make them a plaque can hang it and hang it over their PhD that's a very
[9066.92 → 9069.00] unfortunately human thing I think
[9071.08 → 9071.72] oh no
[9073.56 → 9081.56] uh this is why all the kids want to be YouTubers i I free dopamine I am legitimately I'm legitimately
[9081.56 → 9088.04] more pleased than I probably should be with the pool water cooling setup yeah why that's sick more
[9088.04 → 9092.60] than you should be well I don't know i because it's stupid, and it leaves who cares I don't know
[9092.60 → 9097.32] it's just yeah i I like it, I mean it's fair to care that it could be better it could be better it's a
[9097.32 → 9102.84] good answer so could literally everything yeah but i yeah you know what I'm gonna I'm going to go with
[9102.84 → 9108.52] that not because it's the last one that made me really excited man there was something really recent
[9108.52 → 9115.96] that I was like jazzed to do I mean I had a ton of fun working on that all-in-one gaming TV that was really cool
[9115.96 → 9120.04] all right chat's being very funny today um
[9122.36 → 9124.44] yeah I'm going to go with whole pool water cooling
[9126.28 → 9129.08] it's a good one howdy LLD from Oklahoma
[9130.44 → 9138.04] sup you need a comment there a question for Luke what is the challenge with operating a video site that people don't realize is actually kind of hard
[9138.04 → 9147.64] uh also Linus return of the tall sizes when we are definitely we're going to do tall sizes it's its going to happen
[9148.52 → 9152.20] um I don't know exactly when
[9153.96 → 9160.92] but they're working on it, i think it's just that you have to do I died already this is a very unforgivingly
[9160.92 → 9163.88] difficult game you died you die in this game oh yeah
[9166.12 → 9172.84] 100 percent huh okay um but I'm going to try again I think it's probably just that you have to do
[9172.84 → 9180.76] everything um like if you're a site that has text posts it's like okay well we have creators that can
[9180.76 → 9187.08] post text posts and all the users can comment um, so there's that if your site that does audio okay well
[9187.08 → 9191.24] we support audio if you're something that does download okay well we support downloading if
[9191.24 → 9196.68] you're something that does video okay well we support video if you're something that does live-streaming okay well we support live-streaming it's just like
[9197.72 → 9198.12] oh
[9198.84 → 9202.20] uh there's just so many things and then
[9204.28 → 9205.16] uh
[9205.16 → 9207.16] I couldn't even imagine
[9207.16 → 9209.72] even conceptualizing how to implement live chat
[9211.64 → 9215.72] oh I mean there's I think you could if you sat down and worked on it for a while
[9215.72 → 9217.40] yeah but like you have to do the whole thing
[9219.24 → 9223.32] yeah, but you have to do the whole everything with all web development there's now I'm going to pull
[9223.32 → 9227.32] it back slightly because of your comments uh this is what I want to do there 's's some amount
[9227.32 → 9232.44] of stuff that you can lean on right like even, even live chat like we didn't do this but if you look at
[9232.44 → 9241.72] twitch's origins um they leaned on IRC really heavily you could dial into twitch live chats through IRC
[9241.72 → 9248.84] clients without going on twitch at all back in the day that was a thing people used IRC bots for
[9248.84 → 9256.36] original bot interaction on um on twitch people say you still can wow I didn't know that um you still
[9256.36 → 9262.52] can, but it's a huge pain got it okay yeah I don't know um so like there 's's some amount of like
[9263.40 → 9269.48] internet development does not at all happen in a vacuum any more um, and it hasn't for a really long
[9269.48 → 9275.80] time, so there's like some amount of other stuff you can lean on, but there's just there's just so
[9275.80 → 9282.84] many things that you have to do it's um it's very complicated mostly because of how multifaceted it is
[9282.84 → 9288.20] um if we could just do God it would be a lot easier if we could just do live-streaming it would be a lot
[9288.20 → 9293.88] easier if we could just do photos be a lot easier etc um and that makes it difficult to scale because it's
[9293.88 → 9302.60] already difficult to scale a website that just does um even text um and at a certain level of scale
[9302.60 → 9307.48] that ends up being not the easiest thing in the world uh, and then you make it so that you're scaling
[9307.48 → 9315.56] all these different things all at the same time, and it's like um yeah I don't know that'll be my answer I guess
[9315.56 → 9322.60] just throw terraform at it, I really appreciate that you threw the slash s at the end of that i
[9322.60 → 9327.88] appreciate it um yeah people think stuff like that is a lot more simple than it is because there's I mean
[9327.88 → 9332.04] it comes down to things like there's there are forms of scaling that just like throwing more servers at
[9332.04 → 9341.08] it will not solve your problem either yeah you have to anyway um yeah next one it's a bad hello
[9341.08 → 9345.88] wan show Linus last week you mentioned that how to train your dragon was a perfect movie can you
[9345.88 → 9351.88] expand on that Dan have you watched it, yet no look have you played Final Fantasy 6 I have played it
[9351.88 → 9357.48] but I'm really not much further but I have played if it's on my list sorry Linus oh it's so you're
[9357.48 → 9364.60] gonna watch the live action i I will watch it we've talked about that already got it i I am I'm very
[9364.60 → 9370.84] legitimately actually kind of excited about the live action um well I don't know maybe I'm a little bit
[9370.84 → 9376.92] excited about the live action um it looks like they're pretty faithful to the perfect movie which
[9376.92 → 9384.68] is the original but nothing's a guarantee until things actually happen um so why is it a perfect movie
[9385.80 → 9397.96] because it is it has a perfect soundtrack it is emotional and funny it uh it is it's uh yeah it's uh
[9397.96 → 9401.00] it's ah man okay perfect movie damn it
[9404.36 → 9410.36] better than Paddington 2 I haven't seen Paddington 2 unfortunately I think that lost its 100 rating
[9411.48 → 9416.20] it had a 100 rating it was a perfect film according to rotten tomatoes
[9417.80 → 9424.20] man i that's only 99 perfect someone probably just trolled it no that's on the that's on the um
[9424.20 → 9430.68] I don't know oh the like reviewer side yeah I don't know how I would define a perfect movie other
[9430.68 → 9437.96] than that it's uh it's so tight how to train your dragon also has 99 from critics so I think you're
[9437.96 → 9446.52] accurate yeah like it if there 's's just there is absolutely nothing out of place in it um I saw this
[9446.52 → 9453.16] wonderful breakdown of how well integrated the score and all the major themes for all the major
[9453.16 → 9461.32] characters um is and how uh how they how the the the character themes blend together as the
[9461.32 → 9470.52] characters relationships change like it's just oh it's so good it's so enjoyable for all ages I think
[9470.52 → 9478.60] that's something that is really, really tough to nail like a movie that is for kids but that I don't
[9478.60 → 9485.24] just have to kind of like make my way through like what did I what did we go to see with them recently
[9485.24 → 9490.36] we went to Mona too with the kids recently, and it was like fine like it's a visual spectacle and
[9490.36 → 9497.56] everything, but it like it, we were just kind of we're kind of making our way through it um
[9497.56 → 9505.64] um how to train your dragon is incredible I will definitely throw it on my list I mean it is on my
[9505.64 → 9510.84] list I'll just throw it against my eyes yeah hi LLD what are your thoughts on Google starting
[9510.84 → 9516.12] fingerprinting uh for example cookie list tracking on Sunday thoughts on how to avoid it considering
[9516.12 → 9521.56] how many services google has I thought thinker printing had been going on for a long time forms of it
[9521.56 → 9531.56] yeah um fingerprint scary I forgot a fence how to avoid it is tough uh as far as my understanding
[9531.56 → 9544.52] goes it's the clown and a thumbs up Alberto sorus yeah that's a thing okay cool name
[9544.52 → 9551.32] maybe people will start coming to the parking auction today what do they sell water blocks here
[9553.56 → 9558.20] next up we have what are we talking about what was I talking about oh how to avoid fingerprinting
[9558.20 → 9567.64] uh buy a laptop not using your credit card and then don't sign in to any account on it ever what about
[9567.64 → 9572.92] uh it being fingerprinted by being on your local network attached to other computers do that either
[9572.92 → 9580.20] or monkey go live in the forest or that this is why I want to live in the forest yeah the whole like
[9580.20 → 9586.68] it's only anonymized data it's like yeah until they attach it have you ever seen Google Analytics data
[9586.68 → 9595.64] it's horrifying oh did they fix the if you're under 18 google data yet I doubt it everybody forgot about
[9595.64 → 9606.04] that immediately well hi guys I've been watching the channel since I bought my AMD phenol x4 and wanted
[9606.04 → 9611.56] to learn how to overclock that's a minute ago yeah yeah I thought they wanted to learn how to overclock
[9611.56 → 9619.88] his anon thief four and this was a joke message but oh no, no this is done you just misread it i uh no i i i
[9619.88 → 9625.96] did the first time that's what I thought he was asking for tips nice for how to overclock it now
[9625.96 → 9629.88] but no that's when he started yeah well there's a great channel that you can check out to learn how
[9629.88 → 9635.08] to overclock that phenom x4 and six tech tips I think that was where we uploaded the guide for that
[9635.72 → 9641.96] man I wish overclocking was still a thing apparently 50 80. I've heard it's pretty good I haven't actually
[9641.96 → 9650.68] no experience myself I've heard I'd, I'd love to get one somehow I mean you could borrow one
[9650.68 → 9656.36] once we're done working with it, but we're not so go away uh yeah no I've I've committed to the people
[9657.00 → 9662.28] that any 50 series GPUs oh I just meant for like playing around with overclock oh for keeping sure
[9662.28 → 9667.88] sure sure yeah it's ours if I take anything home it's uh hands off I'm going to have to buy it which
[9667.88 → 9673.88] means I'm going to be waiting a minute because I'm not on the I'm not on any wait lists so I've heard
[9673.88 → 9681.24] 50 80s are becoming more acquirable they're less exciting oh yeah so that would explain it I don't
[9681.24 → 9688.12] think AI developers care about them at all okay last one I got for you today sure going to get the rest
[9688.12 → 9693.56] next week when lanyards when and if it hasn't been mentioned since I can't watch live is there a story
[9693.56 → 9701.24] of the cat in the maze cats are cute, and they're awesome and that's a pretty good story yeah there's
[9701.24 → 9710.44] half a cat yeah well oh no that's less cute there's a full cat yeah full cats are better than half cats
[9710.44 → 9718.84] yeah um well no he's just hiding yeah it's probably full if you look behind the stitch as for
[9718.84 → 9725.48] wan lanyards I mean i I think we don't we have those lanyards uh I stole that from game grime and chat
[9726.60 → 9734.60] uh oh well we had them at some point I thought we did is this oh it's uh currently notify me when
[9734.60 → 9738.84] available oh it's just this colour scheme yeah it's my favourite colour scheme I had that that one is the
[9738.84 → 9747.56] one that I still use um I don't know I will tell you though that we've had a lot of designs that have
[9747.56 → 9753.00] faded away off the site over the years and i I pitched something to the merch team there's no
[9753.00 → 9758.12] guarantee that anything will actually happen to it but I pitched to them that it would be pretty cool
[9758.12 → 9764.68] for us to bring up like a big list of all our old designs and then throw it to the community thunder
[9764.68 → 9772.12] dome and let them vote for thunder like one or a small handful for us to bring back I can think of a
[9772.12 → 9776.60] few that if they came back I'd try to like to buy a couple of them so I can have them for a while Luke nuke
[9777.32 → 9782.68] no I still wear mine regularly that's what I'm saying I didn't get one I'm sad
[9784.36 → 9786.68] did I tell you about the one time I wore it out
[9788.60 → 9796.28] really I think you did on I might have I had to i had to go pick up uh Emma's car from a tire shop
[9796.28 → 9802.36] she's just getting tire swapped and I was just like I was just like lounging at home so i just
[9802.36 → 9806.04] had what I was whatever I was wearing on I forgot I was wearing the Luke nuke shirt
[9806.04 → 9811.16] which you secretly wear whenever you don't think anyone's looking yes go on no, no and i uh and I go
[9811.16 → 9815.48] to walk to pick it up, and the guy just looks at me looks down my shirt and I don't remember exactly
[9815.48 → 9820.28] what he says, but it's something along the lines of like Luke nuke eh he doesn't know my name i
[9820.28 → 9826.92] didn't give them my name ever but he just vibes checked me and just knew and I was just like
[9826.92 → 9832.92] oh why are you wearing a shirt with your face on it because it does look like you Sarah told me
[9832.92 → 9836.12] when she was working on it, she's like I don't think I can make it look like him, I'm like dude it looks
[9836.12 → 9842.44] like him, you did a great job ship it so literally the one time I wore it like outdoors I got called
[9842.44 → 9849.64] on it immediately I was outside my car both at home and therefore like less than five minutes
[9850.76 → 9854.76] how have I forgotten this story snuggle says you've told this story a billion times well
[9854.76 → 9857.64] whatever I'm pretty sure I did I love it every single time then
[9861.24 → 9867.40] oh man and I love every time hearing you say we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[9867.40 → 9876.44] bye keep me on my toes for that one I'm going to win too now
[9879.88 → 9885.08] i uh I threw away a lot of money letting that dinosaur escape no you have to go you have to go home
[9886.36 → 9887.08] right
