[0.00 → 10.48] What's up everybody? Welcome to the WAN Show. We've got a great show lined up for you this
[10.48 → 18.94] week. We'll be talking about a company that is under fire for anti-consumer behaviour and
[18.94 → 25.02] I'll be breaking my silence on them a little bit because they were on my do not talk about
[25.02 → 31.26] list after they threatened to sue me a number of years ago. That's right my friends. We'll also be
[31.26 → 43.48] talking about the RTX 5060 lava that happened this week and the silver lining of it because
[43.48 → 51.34] the good news is the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti are not the only budget GPUs out there and there are other
[51.34 → 57.26] ones that you can get for a reasonable price near MSRP right now. What else we got going on this week?
[57.96 → 65.08] Discord trials face scans to verify your age which means that if you want to look at something not
[65.08 → 71.54] safe for work you have to show them who you are first. That's cool. That's cute. And also there's
[71.54 → 78.70] some companies that have done good things over the unfortunately years looking at the time frame
[78.70 → 84.04] that we got the good things from, and we'll talk about that to try to make it positive. And by popular
[84.04 → 91.50] demand the ship storm sale event has been extended. We've been offering free shipping on all orders
[91.50 → 99.18] over $150 on LTT store this week. It waits what's going on right now? Oh, it ends tomorrow at midnight
[99.18 → 103.94] so we technically only have a little over one more day of free shipping. No. Wait what? What am I
[103.94 → 112.12] supposed to? Oh, wait no. Now you have until Tuesday. You got it. April 22nd at 10 a.m. Pacific time to get
[112.12 → 118.76] free shipping on all orders over $150 and there's more. You can get our magnetic cable management
[118.76 → 126.84] essential solution for 70 bucks off so that's that's the big hit there and we're also taking
[126.84 → 132.28] $10 off our MCM starter kit so that's now only 15 bucks. Okay but we'll be gonna whatever just we'll
[132.28 → 133.02] talk about that more later.
[133.02 → 158.68] The show is brought to you today by Net Data, Proton, and Delete Me. Also of course our wrap partner
[158.68 → 165.64] brand our laptop partner Dell and our chair partner Secret Lab. All right let's jump right
[165.64 → 174.52] into our headline topic this week. A name I have not spoken the name of in quite some time. Synology.
[176.20 → 184.90] Hexes NAS operating system disclosure. So I recently invested in the creation of a user-friendly NAS
[184.90 → 191.24] software that you can just install on your own hardware without being locked into someone's
[191.24 → 196.38] hardware ecosystem. That's going to be relevant in a moment. First let's talk about what happened.
[196.46 → 203.56] A couple of days ago Synology's plus series of NAS systems no longer allowed the use of
[203.56 → 210.12] non-Synology or non-certified drives to get the full set of features on their NAS.
[210.12 → 211.12] Instead...
[211.12 → 212.00] Certified hard drives.
[212.18 → 219.02] Yeah instead customers will be required to buy the company's branded hard drives which by the way if
[219.02 → 226.32] you've ever... yeah yeah if you know anything about company branded hard drives like HP hard drives
[226.32 → 229.16] HP doesn't make hard drives.
[229.16 → 229.94] Not at all.
[230.14 → 236.30] And so typically these vendor locked hard drives are just normal hard drives but with a
[236.30 → 242.40] custom firmware on them and a sticker that locks them so that you have to pay... so you have to buy them
[242.40 → 248.52] directly from the vendor. Users that choose to use non-certified drives they'll still work
[248.52 → 252.02] and they'll still be able to store data, but apparently they will lose the following.
[252.30 → 261.48] Showing estimated drive health reports, volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, automatic firmware updates,
[261.48 → 274.48] and more. 2024 and older models of Synology's plus series will apparently not be affected by this change, but new devices will have this feature enabled.
[274.48 → 284.48] There apparently is already a workaround if you set up your unsupported drives in an older Synology NAS then migrate them over.
[284.48 → 299.48] They will not be locked out of those features according to Tom's hardware which proves that this is absolutely not a hardware feature and is 100% a software lock.
[299.48 → 300.48] Yeah that's garbage.
[300.48 → 303.48] Yeah that is absolute trash garbage.
[303.48 → 309.48] And yeah I think that's pretty poppy.
[309.48 → 319.48] In general I've not been like a huge fan of Synology NAS's. I don't know if you remember this but one of the early things that I was super into...
[319.48 → 321.48] Do you remember Windows Home Server?
[321.48 → 322.48] Yeah yeah.
[322.48 → 325.48] Okay I was super into Windows Home Server.
[325.48 → 326.48] Yeah.
[326.48 → 330.48] I loved it. It was easy to manage with a full graphical UI.
[330.48 → 335.48] It had a brain-dead simple interface for backing up all the systems on your local network.
[335.48 → 346.48] The issue with Windows Home Server aside from Microsoft abandoning it was that Windows doesn't really have a great software raid.
[346.48 → 347.48] Yeah.
[347.48 → 350.48] And Microsoft just never saw fit to build it.
[350.48 → 355.48] My understanding is that storage spaces at a certain level if you are a...
[355.48 → 360.48] Enough of a wizard administrator might be kind of usable for something.
[360.48 → 365.48] But I have never personally had that experience with it.
[365.48 → 368.48] And apparently neither have a lot of people.
[368.48 → 371.48] But Windows Home Server was super cool.
[371.48 → 383.48] One of the things that I liked about it was that it gave you all the benefits of you know one of these little NAS boxes that you could then buy from companies like Synology like QNAP or whoever else.
[383.48 → 386.48] But you weren't locked to that hardware.
[386.48 → 388.48] You could plug in as many drives as you wanted.
[388.48 → 391.48] You could put an HBA in and just expand it.
[391.48 → 393.48] You could add more RAM.
[393.48 → 395.48] You could put in a faster CPU.
[395.48 → 396.48] You could have it do...
[396.48 → 402.48] You could have it do anything you wanted depending on how much performance you needed or how much storage you needed.
[402.48 → 407.48] And that's one of the things that always kind of bothered me about these locked down Cases.
[407.48 → 411.48] To be clear I understand why people buy them and I understand why people like them.
[411.48 → 414.48] They're pretty much ready to go out of the box.
[414.48 → 419.48] And we have done videos on them in the past where I've said yeah this seems pretty reasonable.
[419.48 → 421.48] But a lot of the time they're not that reasonable.
[421.48 → 431.48] And it's it appears to me to be fully intentional where they will, you know not put an M.2 slot on that one.
[431.48 → 441.48] Or they will not have a PCIe slot to make sure that you can't have 10 gig networking on that one that would otherwise totally work as a video editing NAS for instance.
[441.48 → 452.48] And so the holy grail for me has always been to have the benefits of a completely custom solution.
[452.48 → 459.48] You know running some Linux distro or whatever else with you know ZFS with whatever fancy patches.
[459.48 → 463.48] And you know you've got all your virtualization running on it and whatever else right.
[463.48 → 476.48] So having all the benefits of that plus the benefits of just easy an easy kind of interface, and you know a setup wizard and the simplicity that you get from these pre-done NAS boxes.
[476.48 → 484.48] Because right now you either have to learn a bunch of stuff that can be fun for some people and that's great.
[484.48 → 485.48] If you're into that.
[485.48 → 489.48] That's awesome, and I think that's super cool.
[489.48 → 497.48] But not everybody's into that, or you have to pay a lot of money for devices that appear to be planned obsolescence incarnate.
[497.48 → 499.48] Very intentionally.
[499.48 → 506.48] And you know this is something that has been very apparent to me about Synology's model for many years.
[506.48 → 509.48] And now they've been they're basically saying the quiet part out loud.
[509.48 → 510.48] Yeah.
[510.48 → 515.48] By switching to this vendor certified vendor locked down hard drive model.
[515.48 → 516.48] And.
[516.48 → 517.48] Hexes disclosure?
[517.48 → 518.48] I already did.
[518.48 → 519.48] Okay.
[519.48 → 520.48] Yep.
[520.48 → 528.48] And that, and I was getting to that is exactly why I invested in Hexes because I think you should be able to install something that is as simple to use as Synology.
[528.48 → 539.48] It has that out of box experience and app support and ease of use factor while also having the performance and the flexibility of a DIY NAS solution.
[539.48 → 549.48] And I think they've kind of nailed it because they're going to have a subscription model for the software, but they will also have a more expensive one time purchase model.
[549.48 → 553.48] And then you just have it forever, and you can just have whatever hardware you want your Hexes NAS.
[553.48 → 558.48] Now just because you have the license forever doesn't mean they will have no subscriptions like they might introduce their own cloud service or whatever.
[558.48 → 559.48] Yeah.
[559.48 → 560.48] For backup.
[560.48 → 561.48] Something like that.
[561.48 → 564.48] That requires constant effort or expense on their end.
[564.48 → 566.48] So it has to be tied with a subscription.
[566.48 → 567.48] Yeah.
[567.48 → 571.48] But in terms of the base software itself, once you own it forever, you will own it forever.
[571.48 → 573.48] They're apparently doing great.
[573.48 → 576.48] By the way, I am like kind of blown away.
[576.48 → 578.48] What's like user feedback?
[578.48 → 581.48] People have been really understanding the community.
[581.48 → 591.48] The community, not just the user community, but the developer community has rallied hard around Hexes because they're just like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[591.48 → 592.48] Like this is common sense.
[592.48 → 594.48] Why do we not have this?
[594.48 → 596.48] Someone's finally doing it.
[596.48 → 597.48] I'm in.
[597.48 → 606.48] Like apparently when we talked about them for the launch, they got just an avalanche of developer applications.
[606.48 → 612.48] And I don't mean like script kiddies who are like, I want to I want to help develop Hexes.
[612.48 → 617.48] Like they showed me some of the portfolios work for them.
[617.48 → 618.48] I thought you meant.
[618.48 → 619.48] Okay.
[619.48 → 620.48] Okay.
[620.48 → 621.48] Yeah.
[621.48 → 624.48] So that's a lot of people creating things for the platform.
[624.48 → 625.48] No, no.
[625.48 → 631.48] Avalanche of applications from people who have portfolios that I was like, oh, what?
[631.48 → 633.48] Like they could work anywhere they want.
[633.48 → 634.48] Yeah.
[634.48 → 635.48] Yeah.
[635.48 → 637.48] Basically, or just not work or whatever.
[637.48 → 639.48] Like, no, like, wow.
[639.48 → 642.48] Anyway, so yeah, they've got some really talented people working on it now.
[642.48 → 651.48] So let's so anyway, before Hexes was even a twinkle in the eye of John and Eric and the guys over there.
[651.48 → 670.48] My kind of, you know, tech tips for the people solution to marry the DIY benefits with the ease of use software benefits was like, hey, we should do a video on that Synology like Hackintosh Hack ology or what?
[670.48 → 671.48] What's it called?
[671.48 → 675.48] What's a okay, hold on the Synology.
[675.48 → 677.48] There's the what's it called?
[677.48 → 678.48] What's it called?
[678.48 → 679.48] But it but but but.
[679.48 → 680.48] Ethnology.
[680.48 → 681.48] Ethnology.
[681.48 → 686.48] I don't know if it actually still works, but it was a thing back when we did it.
[686.48 → 689.48] And there's, there were some limitations, right?
[689.48 → 692.48] Like there was some challenges like it only work on certain hardware.
[692.48 → 695.48] There were some like weird hacky workarounds.
[695.48 → 703.48] And from my point of view, it absolutely was not a complete replacement for, for Synology.
[703.48 → 708.48] And to be clear, I didn't expect Synology to be like stoked that this was something we were making a video about.
[708.48 → 721.48] But we actually got as far as shooting the entire video and the actual conclusion of it was like, yeah, if you want the best possible experience, you got to buy the hardware key for the lock here.
[721.48 → 727.48] But this is if you are, you know, kind of willing to deal with some challenges.
[727.48 → 729.48] You can adapt to this thing you might already have.
[729.48 → 734.48] Then you could then you can install this on hardware that you already have, and it like kind of mostly works.
[734.48 → 741.48] And I think it would have actually sold a lot of Synology Cases because most people wouldn't have been willing to go through this work.
[741.48 → 751.48] Well, we ultimately never released that video because they came after us incredibly hard.
[751.48 → 752.48] How did they know you're even making it?
[752.48 → 756.48] I do not remember, to be perfectly honest with you.
[756.48 → 768.48] But we basically said, hey, yeah, we don't agree that us making a video about a thing that is common knowledge breaks any kind of agreement we would have with you of any sort.
[768.48 → 771.48] And I don't think it does. No, it really doesn't.
[771.48 → 778.48] But I wanted to just publish the video to be, you know, full cards on the table here.
[778.48 → 780.48] I just wanted to say it and just publish the video.
[780.48 → 793.48] But we had other voices internally who felt very strongly that at a somewhat vulnerable time for our company, we did not have strong cash reserves.
[793.48 → 796.48] We were not equipped to fight, go to war.
[796.48 → 799.48] Yeah. And that's what they, unfortunately.
[799.48 → 805.48] And, you know, I am making some guests about when it might have been and that might have been the right call at the time.
[805.48 → 807.48] But unfortunately, that's what they want.
[807.48 → 809.48] Yes. And that's exactly what they want.
[809.48 → 812.48] These companies use this as a tool.
[812.48 → 815.48] They don't actually want to end up in court with you.
[815.48 → 824.48] So the so the compromise that we reached was that Synology would be dead to us at that point.
[824.48 → 826.48] And there have been a couple exceptions to that.
[826.48 → 831.48] I think someone's tech upgrade at some point included a Synology NAS.
[831.48 → 833.48] And I basically went, well, this seems like a bit of an exception.
[833.48 → 835.48] I'm not talking about it.
[835.48 → 842.48] And I'm not going to limit people's options for tech upgrades to like brands that I, you know, get along with or whatever.
[842.48 → 844.48] Sure. Right.
[844.48 → 848.48] But other than that, I.
[848.48 → 850.48] I won't work with them.
[850.48 → 857.48] I won't like I need, I'd need an apology before I would even talk to them essentially.
[857.48 → 859.48] Which has happened with brands before.
[859.48 → 866.48] Well, yeah, of course, because usually what it comes down to is that, you know, someone who works there has a chip on their shoulder or whatever.
[866.48 → 868.48] And that individual eventually moves on.
[868.48 → 875.48] And, you know, the reality of it is that we're probably going to outlast most individuals in the particular role that they're in.
[875.48 → 876.48] And so we can just play the waiting game.
[876.48 → 878.48] I mean, that's what happened with Nvidia.
[878.48 → 879.48] Yeah.
[879.48 → 883.48] Nvidia, the entity didn't like, you know, want to mend fences.
[883.48 → 889.48] A couple particular people who were ass hurt moved on.
[889.48 → 892.48] And so we'll, we'll work with them.
[892.48 → 902.48] And I want to make it very clear, you know, that is in spite of the fact that we are going to continue to cover them in a way that is fair and balanced and call them out when they do things that are wrong.
[902.48 → 906.48] Have you talked to them since maybe we shouldn't talk about this on the show?
[906.48 → 907.48] Have you talked to them since that video went up?
[907.48 → 908.48] No.
[908.48 → 910.48] I mean, why would I?
[910.48 → 911.48] There's nothing else to say.
[911.48 → 912.48] I already said everything I have to say.
[912.48 → 913.48] What are they going to say?
[913.48 → 915.48] Knowing this current crew.
[917.48 → 919.48] I don't think that would make them run, which is cool.
[919.48 → 920.48] I don't think so.
[920.48 → 921.48] I think that's cool.
[921.48 → 922.48] Genuinely cool.
[922.48 → 928.48] I think that this because that's the thing, right, is like I respect that actually a lot.
[928.48 → 932.48] That doesn't mean that, you know, they're that they have ignored it.
[932.48 → 933.48] Oh, yeah.
[933.48 → 934.48] They haven't heard what we've said.
[934.48 → 942.48] It just means that they're looking for a path forward, and they're not going to let this poison everything else that we could possibly work together on.
[942.48 → 943.48] Sounds good.
[943.48 → 948.48] And, you know, I understand that being a tough thing, to be clear.
[948.48 → 955.48] But like, that's the that's the can't, you can't let relationships influence.
[955.48 → 956.48] Well, no, I mean, that's that's the same.
[956.48 → 958.48] You got to do what you got to do.
[958.48 → 959.48] Well, no, I mean, that's that's the same.
[959.48 → 960.48] You got to do what you got to do.
[960.48 → 968.48] It's the same reason that we will, you know, continue to cover Apple, even though they have never seeded us a device or given us even a briefing or answered a question.
[968.48 → 971.48] But we'll continue to cover them.
[971.48 → 979.48] And I can absolutely not like their arrogance that they think that because they don't have an aligned worldview, they don't need to answer your questions or engage with you.
[979.48 → 980.48] Mm hmm.
[980.48 → 981.48] That's totally valid.
[981.48 → 986.48] But if they make a good product like, you know, AirPods Pro 2s, I absolutely love mine.
[986.48 → 990.48] And I say nothing but good things about all the good things about them.
[990.48 → 992.48] Then you just you have to separate that.
[992.48 → 997.48] You have to separate sort of the corporate culture from the individuals who work there from the product.
[997.48 → 999.48] Those things can all be.
[999.48 → 1009.48] Have they can all be very different and all of those differences can be very valid, but you can't let them bleed into each other as best you can as best you can at least.
[1009.48 → 1027.48] So long story short, Synology, hopefully you can go yourself in the longer term because it will be as simple as just picking up not overpriced hardware and installing investment disclosure hex OS on it.
[1027.48 → 1030.48] And I will never have to say your name again.
[1030.48 → 1032.48] And good luck with that.
[1032.48 → 1043.48] And especially because you guys think it's cool to vendor lock hard drives on consumer systems, which on an enterprise system, I can at least kind of see it.
[1043.48 → 1046.48] Like if you have some like.
[1046.48 → 1047.48] Like.
[1047.48 → 1057.48] I don't know, disk shelf, like giant, you know, like rack based San system or something like that.
[1057.48 → 1065.48] And the vendors basically like look, we've only validated this particular firmware revision and this these particular models.
[1065.48 → 1072.48] And if you put something else in it, look, your warranty is valid because that's all invalid because that's all that we validated.
[1072.48 → 1085.48] I think there's at least an argument to be made there because the operation of that device, that entire device is covered by the service agreement that that vendor has with you.
[1085.48 → 1086.48] It's a totally different scenario.
[1086.48 → 1088.48] So it is actually their problem.
[1088.48 → 1091.48] If something goes wrong with it, totally get it.
[1091.48 → 1095.48] For a consumer who's backing up their photos to a freaking hard drive.
[1095.48 → 1098.48] No, I'm afraid I don't get that.
[1098.48 → 1100.48] I don't actually think that that's OK.
[1100.48 → 1103.48] All right.
[1103.48 → 1104.48] What?
[1104.48 → 1105.48] What?
[1105.48 → 1107.48] What do we would do we what else do you want to talk about this week?
[1107.48 → 1108.48] Mr. Luke?
[1108.48 → 1111.48] We only had one main news topic.
[1111.48 → 1112.48] Should we talk about that one?
[1112.48 → 1113.48] We have more than one.
[1113.48 → 1114.48] Pretty sure there's two.
[1114.48 → 1115.48] They're kind of connected.
[1115.48 → 1116.48] They are not connected.
[1116.48 → 1117.48] They're a little bit connected.
[1117.48 → 1119.48] They're not connected at all.
[1119.48 → 1120.48] It's not all bad.
[1120.48 → 1121.48] Yeah.
[1121.48 → 1123.48] Is that not connected to the story above it being bad?
[1123.48 → 1124.48] No.
[1124.48 → 1125.48] No.
[1125.48 → 1127.48] Oh, I legitimately thought it was.
[1127.48 → 1129.48] No, they're just totally unrelated.
[1129.48 → 1130.48] OK.
[1130.48 → 1131.48] You pick whichever one you like, Mr. Luke.
[1131.48 → 1134.48] Let's do let's do the 5060 one.
[1134.48 → 1135.48] Let's do it.
[1135.48 → 1143.48] So this is now the fifth or sixth big GPU launch since you took over the lab.
[1143.48 → 1146.48] There's been six so far in this quarter.
[1146.48 → 1148.48] So I think that's correct.
[1148.48 → 1149.48] Yeah.
[1149.48 → 1150.48] And how did you feel it went?
[1150.48 → 1151.48] Let's talk.
[1151.48 → 1152.48] Let's talk about.
[1152.48 → 1155.48] Let's talk about sort of our process for evaluating product.
[1155.48 → 1156.48] So I want two answers.
[1156.48 → 1160.48] One is how do you think the kind of the because we did test the card.
[1160.48 → 1164.48] We uploaded a short circuit video looking at the 5060 TI 16 gig.
[1164.48 → 1165.48] How do I think this one went?
[1165.48 → 1166.48] Are we talking about the.
[1166.48 → 1167.48] How'd your team do?
[1167.48 → 1168.48] Oh, great.
[1168.48 → 1169.48] Yeah.
[1169.48 → 1170.48] I'm very happy with the lab.
[1170.48 → 1171.48] I am.
[1171.48 → 1175.48] It's been a weird journey.
[1175.48 → 1176.48] It's good.
[1176.48 → 1180.48] Like I've never I've I've I have a quite few teams at this point.
[1180.48 → 1183.48] I've never taken over a team though.
[1183.48 → 1188.48] Every team that I've had liked everyone on all of my teams other than the lab.
[1188.48 → 1190.48] I hired them.
[1190.48 → 1191.48] Yeah.
[1191.48 → 1192.48] All of them.
[1192.48 → 1195.48] So like this was a very new experience.
[1195.48 → 1204.48] Um, and there were some things that like I tripped on at the start because I'm just very not used to this my first time doing that all that kind of stuff getting used to.
[1204.48 → 1206.48] Uh, new people getting used to new processes.
[1206.48 → 1214.48] The lab does a lot of stuff getting used to that trying to figure out like what the heck is even going on with different parts of it.
[1214.48 → 1221.48] Um, I don't know if you remember, but there was a thing that I completely shut down, which was like literally most of the work that they did within the first week of joining.
[1221.48 → 1222.48] Yeah.
[1222.48 → 1223.48] I'm sure.
[1223.48 → 1224.48] Tell the people.
[1224.48 → 1225.48] Sure.
[1225.48 → 1226.48] Yeah.
[1226.48 → 1234.48] I, I stepped in and one of the first things I did was I said that I said that I would have a meeting with every single person in the department.
[1234.48 → 1237.48] A one-on-one with every single person in the department before I made any drastic decisions.
[1237.48 → 1244.48] And then I got two one-on-ones in paused all the remaining one-on-ones and did an extremely dramatic decision.
[1244.48 → 1248.48] Uh, which I don't think that was one of the trips.
[1248.48 → 1249.48] Actually.
[1249.48 → 1250.48] I think that was the right move.
[1250.48 → 1251.48] Yeah.
[1251.48 → 1256.48] And that was, I figured out, uh, like what percentage of time people were spending on different things.
[1256.48 → 1259.48] And it was coming out from like almost everyone.
[1259.48 → 1262.48] A huge percentage of it was short circuit.
[1262.48 → 1263.48] Yep.
[1263.48 → 1265.48] And short circuit is cool, but I'm looking at the-
[1265.48 → 1266.48] Left short circuit.
[1266.48 → 1268.48] The cost and size of the lab.
[1268.48 → 1275.48] And if you try to look at the, the holistic cost of both the, the equipment, the space, uh, the salaries, all that type of stuff.
[1275.48 → 1280.48] And then you apply the percentage of that lab's time that was being spent on short circuit.
[1280.48 → 1284.48] And the math just is really not matching here.
[1284.48 → 1285.48] Um, bad matching.
[1285.48 → 1291.48] So I was like, Whoa, let's, um, let's pause this if we can.
[1291.48 → 1294.48] Which isn't to say that we're not going to do labs testing on short circuit.
[1294.48 → 1295.48] We obviously just did.
[1295.48 → 1299.48] We're already doing, we did like 30 of them over the last quarter or something.
[1299.48 → 1302.48] But we had a lot of workflow things to figure out.
[1302.48 → 1303.48] Yeah.
[1303.48 → 1307.48] To smooth out that process before we could do it.
[1307.48 → 1309.48] And we're, we're still working on those things.
[1309.48 → 1311.48] Like we're hiring testers right now.
[1311.48 → 1314.48] Um, we're in the I wouldn't, I don't know if the post is still up.
[1314.48 → 1318.48] Uh, if you're applying now, I mean, there's a chance, but it's probably too late.
[1318.48 → 1321.48] Um, but we're interviewing testers right now.
[1321.48 → 1323.48] Uh, we're hiring three.
[1323.48 → 1326.48] Um, we just brought on a testing coordinator.
[1326.48 → 1327.48] Nice.
[1327.48 → 1329.48] Which is going to be really nice as well.
[1329.48 → 1330.48] Yep.
[1330.48 → 1333.48] Um, so that person's job is going to be, you know, to keep the tests flowing.
[1333.48 → 1338.48] One, one thing I said, the beginning, what I want them working on is mostly communication.
[1338.48 → 1340.48] Make sure people outside our department know what's going on.
[1340.48 → 1343.48] Make sure people inside our department know what they're supposed to be doing.
[1343.48 → 1344.48] Know what's going on.
[1344.48 → 1348.48] Make sure that things are flowing properly, all that kind of stuff in the longer run.
[1348.48 → 1353.48] Something that I want them working on is optimizing, um, like station efficiency.
[1353.48 → 1356.48] And what I kind of mean by that is, um, say we have some data.
[1356.48 → 1358.48] Say we have some GPU embargo.
[1358.48 → 1359.48] Yeah.
[1359.48 → 1362.48] It doesn't mean that every other station should stay cold.
[1362.48 → 1365.48] That's one of the ideas of having more testers as well.
[1365.48 → 1366.48] Yeah.
[1366.48 → 1369.48] Is even if the majority of the testers are all focused on one like crazy project.
[1369.48 → 1370.48] Yeah.
[1370.48 → 1373.48] There should still be enough extra testers that we can keep the other stations kind of moving
[1373.48 → 1375.48] and keep things pumping through the lab.
[1375.48 → 1378.48] Um, but yeah, I, I was like, okay, we're spending all this time doing this.
[1378.48 → 1380.48] There's no free time to work on process.
[1380.48 → 1382.48] There's no free time to do all this kind of stuff.
[1382.48 → 1385.48] Let's pause for like two, three months and really try to hammer this stuff out.
[1385.48 → 1387.48] We rewrote a ton of process.
[1387.48 → 1391.48] We redid a ton of different things and kind of got a better look of what we wanted in the future.
[1391.48 → 1396.48] When I first started with the department, I was looking sometimes hours forward.
[1396.48 → 1401.48] And then now at this point I'm looking months, year plus forward.
[1401.48 → 1410.48] Um, and there's some, there are some cool plans, but this was, this was a good, the, the six GPUs was a fantastic push.
[1410.48 → 1423.48] Now let's talk about how things went, uh, with the 50, 60, 50, 60 TI from like an, an overall execution outside of labs standpoint.
[1423.48 → 1428.48] Um, you know what?
[1428.48 → 1445.48] Here, why don't I read through the notes on April 16th, Nvidia launched the 50, 60 family, which included the RTX 50, 60 with eight gigs of Ram, the RTX 50, 60 TI with eight gigs of Ram.
[1445.48 → 1458.48] Um, even though these cards are out, um, now almost everywhere only lists the 50, 60 TI 16 gig.
[1458.48 → 1467.48] Um, the other two models are expected to, you know, be physically present in the real world at some point, but nobody seems to know when.
[1467.48 → 1475.48] So we decided, uh, not because the lab was not capable of doing the testing as, as Luke already mentioned, the lab was fully capable of doing the testing.
[1475.48 → 1479.48] In fact, they did some testing for our short circuit video on the 50, 60 TI 16 gig.
[1479.48 → 1501.48] Uh, but we decided that because we didn't feel that this situation was very consumer first, that we were not going to do a review, but instead did a rant style video about how this entire launch felt, not just the 60 class cards, but the 50 series in general, uh, from the perspective, uh, from several perspectives, from an Nvidia partner perspective.
[1501.48 → 1507.48] We included a little bit of that, uh, from a press perspective and especially from a consumer perspective.
[1507.48 → 1524.48] One thing that we did not really include in the video, because I couldn't say this factually for certain, but one thing that we didn't include in the video is that my personal theory for why they rolled it out this way is that they want customer confusion.
[1524.48 → 1534.48] I think that they want a heap of reviews on the 50, 60 TI 16 gig, right?
[1534.48 → 1543.48] And because this is the first member of the family that anyone can get their hands on, and they want those to be at the top of the search results.
[1543.48 → 1560.48] And then I believe that Nvidia had no intention whatsoever of seeding the other cards in any kind of timely manner, or maybe at all, basically just leaving it to their board partners or leaving it to media outlets to go and source them on their own and drips and drabs.
[1560.48 → 1575.26] By which time there would be literally zero remaining excitement around the 50, 60 series, because even the TI 16 gig was not exactly going to light anyone's world on fire in terms of the, the, the value proposition of it.
[1575.34 → 1577.18] That doesn't mean it's a bad card.
[1577.36 → 1580.26] It just means that it's not exciting anybody.
[1580.26 → 1605.20] And I think that the benefit for Nvidia of this kind of confusion and of this, of, of having something with a very similar model name, have all the views, all the SEO, all the algorithmic weight is that people would see enough, something affordable, 50, 60, 50, 60 TI eight gig, something sort of within their budget on the shelf and go, Oh, okay.
[1605.20 → 1608.24] So 50, 60, like, is that good?
[1608.42 → 1613.86] And they'd end up with a review of the 50, 60, 16 gig that would look better than the thing that they're actually buying.
[1614.26 → 1615.28] That is my theory.
[1615.50 → 1621.64] Is this counter to your theory from, I think four WAN sago, where are you saying that reviewers don't matter anymore?
[1622.50 → 1635.04] Um, I think that, I think that Nvidia thinks reviewers still matter, but not enough to do this whole thing properly.
[1635.20 → 1637.84] Or they think that reviewers can have an influence.
[1637.84 → 1641.26] And I think that this was an effort to actively work against it.
[1641.98 → 1645.92] So I think, I think that is Nvidia's intention, whether it would work or not.
[1647.82 → 1648.42] Got it.
[1648.42 → 1656.54] I think they wanted the perception of the 50, 60, 60 series to be set around the performance of the TI 16 gig.
[1656.54 → 1663.84] And then they could deliver the lower price of the other ones and hopefully keep those things separated from each other.
[1663.96 → 1669.02] Do you remember another time, because I don't, when Nvidia launched a card with no embargo?
[1669.96 → 1670.26] Yes.
[1670.70 → 1672.90] One of the Titan cards, they did it.
[1673.62 → 1676.74] And I, I outright refused to make content about it.
[1677.12 → 1678.86] I was like, this is completely unacceptable.
[1678.86 → 1683.16] And some people seem to get really confused.
[1683.36 → 1685.06] I went on a shadow-ban spree.
[1685.52 → 1691.20] Uh, anyone who said that our upset was because we're just like, butt hurt, we didn't get a free card.
[1691.44 → 1691.88] That's dumb.
[1691.90 → 1692.98] Got permanently banned.
[1693.22 → 1697.78] Because that, you're actually too stupid for me to listen to anything that you say ever again.
[1697.84 → 1703.94] The value of a free card compared to like the average daily expenses at this company is hilarious.
[1704.20 → 1705.74] It's actually trivial.
[1705.74 → 1708.04] You hear Dan laughing in the background.
[1708.90 → 1711.62] That's just like clearly not.
[1711.86 → 1720.58] The reason it matters, the reason that we have review embargoes, and we have organization around a launch is so that it benefits everybody.
[1720.78 → 1721.52] It's fair play.
[1721.70 → 1725.74] Nvidia has time to brief the press on their side of the story.
[1726.40 → 1733.44] The press has time to verify that story and form their own thoughts and opinions.
[1733.46 → 1734.08] Rather important.
[1734.08 → 1740.66] And then everyone goes live with their equally equipped side of the story.
[1740.66 → 1752.26] And the consumer gets a balanced view that is, that can be, that can be put together with time and care and attention and will not be perfect.
[1752.64 → 1761.24] Launch reviews are never going to be perfect because over the days and weeks and months and sometimes years after a launch, we're probably still going to be learning more about the product.
[1761.24 → 1763.90] But at least it's a starting point.
[1764.00 → 1770.00] And there's a huge benefit to consumers where they can go, okay, everyone had a fair shot at this.
[1770.30 → 1771.84] You know whose coverage do I like the best?
[1771.88 → 1772.56] And they have a choice.
[1772.64 → 1773.84] And they don't have to just pick one.
[1774.22 → 1778.28] They can get a perspective from all of these different media outlets.
[1778.40 → 1779.68] Which we suggest they do anyway.
[1779.68 → 1781.62] Is a healthy ecosystem.
[1781.84 → 1782.02] Yeah.
[1782.68 → 1786.66] Providing a card on Thursday afternoon or whatever it was.
[1786.76 → 1788.60] Was it Wednesday afternoon or Thursday afternoon?
[1788.66 → 1790.08] I feel like it was Thursday, but I don't remember.
[1790.22 → 1790.74] It doesn't matter.
[1790.74 → 1807.44] The point is providing a card over a weekend with a launch embargo Tuesday morning is, A, not good for consumers because it means that everyone who's trying to get these videos out for embargo is going to have less time to validate NVIDIA's claims.
[1807.72 → 1810.44] And, B, it's just f***ING disrespectful.
[1811.34 → 1813.08] It's just completely disrespectful.
[1813.64 → 1815.92] And the truth is, it's not me.
[1816.74 → 1818.40] I'm not going to crunch over the weekend.
[1818.40 → 1834.02] We have the benefit of being a large enough organization now that I'm not the one who actually sits there and puts the cards onto the benches and makes the graphs and puts everything on a timeline, edits it.
[1834.60 → 1835.94] No, that's going to be my team.
[1840.02 → 1841.70] Utterly disrespectful.
[1842.28 → 1843.22] And they do it.
[1843.26 → 1844.24] We've got passionate people.
[1844.46 → 1844.80] Of course.
[1844.80 → 1851.70] We don't want them to, which is why, in part, we didn't actually do the big LTT video for this card.
[1852.34 → 1852.40] Yeah.
[1853.48 → 1866.10] Because it's just, and it's one of those things where it's like, look, look, if it was a one-time thing, right, and there was like a good reason, if NVIDIA was basically like, okay, no, no, no, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1866.10 → 1872.04] If NVIDIA was a way smaller company, okay, hold on, let me put you a hypothetical, okay?
[1872.50 → 1878.54] And this product, let's say, okay, let's say NVIDIA was more like a big screen.
[1878.98 → 1881.12] You know, big screen, they make the Beyond VR headset.
[1881.30 → 1882.12] By the way, do you have an iPhone?
[1883.02 → 1883.22] What?
[1883.52 → 1883.92] Yeah.
[1884.46 → 1888.06] I spent money for once, and I need to do a face scan.
[1888.52 → 1890.16] Oh, you bought a big screen Beyond too?
[1890.16 → 1890.56] I bought a big screen Beyond.
[1890.56 → 1891.96] I might want to as well.
[1891.96 → 1897.12] Dude, it's been so, sorry to derail, it's been so long since I've bought, I'm still writing on the Five.
[1898.14 → 1905.02] And I watched a bunch of content on the big screen Beyond too, and I couldn't get this thought out of my head of like, it's time.
[1905.50 → 1906.16] It's perfect.
[1906.26 → 1906.76] It's time.
[1906.82 → 1907.16] It's sick.
[1907.38 → 1908.80] So I'm stoked.
[1909.12 → 1909.54] So anyway.
[1909.68 → 1910.10] I'm very stoked.
[1910.10 → 1910.46] Okay, good.
[1910.52 → 1911.58] Then let's say it was big screen.
[1911.66 → 1911.82] Sure.
[1912.10 → 1916.10] In the past, other than their software, they've only ever had like one hardware product.
[1916.82 → 1917.06] Okay?
[1917.40 → 1917.66] Yep.
[1917.66 → 1920.38] Now they've got, and it sold, my understanding is like pretty Reece.
[1920.54 → 1920.72] Yep.
[1920.72 → 1923.38] But like, you know, pretty Reece, right?
[1923.40 → 1924.86] Still, it's going to be a niche product.
[1924.86 → 1926.02] It's a niche product.
[1926.48 → 1926.66] Okay?
[1926.88 → 1930.26] So if big screen were to say, okay, here's the situation.
[1930.78 → 1934.84] We've got like three cards, or three cards, sorry, excuse me.
[1934.88 → 1936.88] We've got like three headsets.
[1938.42 → 1941.48] The bulk shipment lands like this day.
[1941.84 → 1944.10] We must launch it this day.
[1945.66 → 1947.46] Funding reasons were like screwed.
[1947.62 → 1948.82] We are like out of cash.
[1948.82 → 1949.04] Yeah.
[1949.12 → 1951.12] We actually like, we have payroll that day.
[1951.18 → 1954.26] If we don't get pre-orders in, you're going to love this thing.
[1954.60 → 1956.02] We are absolutely 100%.
[1956.02 → 1956.68] The company will be gone.
[1956.68 → 1959.48] We are 100% certain you're going to love this thing.
[1959.96 → 1961.30] You've got like four days.
[1961.76 → 1963.58] Could you ask the team to work over a weekend?
[1963.90 → 1969.92] We are so confident that your independent, unbiased, unbiased review is going to validate
[1969.92 → 1971.68] our claims that this thing is awesome.
[1971.68 → 1977.30] That we're, you know, look, we're willing to work with people.
[1977.30 → 1978.94] I'll be like, okay, all right.
[1979.00 → 1980.48] It's not going to impact the coverage.
[1980.70 → 1982.72] But yeah, I'll make sure people are here on the weekend.
[1982.82 → 1987.04] We're going to try and hit this embargo because I think you guys are doing great things.
[1987.50 → 1990.46] Everything that I've seen about the product seems really positive.
[1990.46 → 1995.16] My experience with working with you is that you've been very honest in your assessments
[1995.16 → 1997.92] of the quality of the product and the way that you present it.
[1998.20 → 1999.38] All of these things align.
[2000.22 → 2000.44] Yeah.
[2000.52 → 2002.30] Let's, let's get everybody in on the weekend.
[2002.72 → 2004.22] I'll come in on the Sunday night.
[2004.32 → 2004.94] We'll get the film.
[2005.06 → 2005.70] We'll get it shot.
[2005.78 → 2009.54] We'll get an editor in another time zone booked for like an overnight edit.
[2009.62 → 2012.14] Then we'll have a look at it with one of our editors in house on Monday morning.
[2012.30 → 2013.38] Let's get this thing done.
[2013.42 → 2014.78] You know, no problem.
[2017.30 → 2018.30] But that's not Nvidia.
[2018.80 → 2019.10] No.
[2019.10 → 2029.66] Nvidia had absolutely no reason whatsoever financially to, to have this launch on that
[2029.66 → 2029.94] day.
[2031.24 → 2039.62] Imagine Luke, if you will, if Nvidia had delayed the launch of the 50, 60 series for three weeks
[2039.62 → 2046.06] and given us darn near a month to work on our review, they would have launched the card
[2046.06 → 2047.40] and they would have all sold out.
[2047.40 → 2054.34] From a financial standpoint, there is no reason whatsoever that it had to launch that day.
[2054.40 → 2059.16] In fact, two of the three cards were not available at all.
[2059.16 → 2069.42] And my understanding is that another media, I don't want to name them, not because I don't want to name them, but because I'm not sure if it was them.
[2069.42 → 2071.42] You look it up.
[2071.42 → 2072.42] Did what?
[2072.42 → 2073.42] Did what?
[2073.42 → 2074.42] Okay.
[2074.42 → 2085.02] Well, I heard through the grapevine, I have not verified this, that someone said that add and board partners were explicitly told not to seed the other cards, even if they like did have samples.
[2085.02 → 2086.02] Oh, yeah.
[2086.02 → 2087.52] I can't remember who it was though.
[2087.52 → 2089.02] I think it was.
[2089.02 → 2090.02] Okay, I'm going to say it then.
[2090.02 → 2092.02] I'm going to say I think it was hardware unboxed.
[2092.02 → 2093.02] But I'm not sure.
[2093.02 → 2094.02] I really am sure.
[2094.02 → 2095.02] But I'm not 100% sure.
[2095.02 → 2096.02] So please do not quote me on that.
[2096.02 → 2104.02] Anyway, the point is that Nvidia clearly had absolutely no, yeah, Elijah says that's right.
[2104.02 → 2105.02] Yeah, okay.
[2105.02 → 2106.02] Okay.
[2106.02 → 2109.02] Nvidia clearly has no sales incentive whatsoever.
[2109.02 → 2116.02] Not only that, but they are actively ensuring that we cannot test these cards.
[2116.02 → 2128.02] Well, what, how can I possibly assume anything other than bad faith, bad intentions, when you're actively working to keep information about these cards out of consumers' hands?
[2128.02 → 2130.02] Well, it's not like this isn't a pattern.
[2130.02 → 2138.02] As much as I praised them earlier for like, you know, if we can criticize them in that video, and they will still work with us, that's very heads up.
[2138.02 → 2139.02] That's cool.
[2139.02 → 2142.02] That being said, this is a rather egregious pattern.
[2142.02 → 2144.02] I don't think that there has been...
[2144.02 → 2147.02] Oh wait, Elijah says, I don't know if Hardware Unbox said that.
[2147.02 → 2149.02] We heard directly from board partners.
[2149.02 → 2150.02] Okay.
[2150.02 → 2152.02] Hath says that was Hub though, so maybe they heard the same thing.
[2152.02 → 2153.02] So take that for what it is.
[2153.02 → 2154.02] Take that for what it is.
[2154.02 → 2155.02] I'm really not sure.
[2155.02 → 2156.02] Okay.
[2156.02 → 2160.02] But at least since the 1000 series...
[2160.02 → 2162.02] Hub apparently said it as well.
[2162.02 → 2163.02] Okay.
[2163.02 → 2171.02] I feel like before then, but at least from the 1000 series, I haven't seen an Nvidia launch that didn't have just like egregious falsehoods in the announcement.
[2171.02 → 2173.02] I've seen some.
[2173.02 → 2174.02] Since 1000 series?
[2174.02 → 2175.02] Yeah.
[2175.02 → 2176.02] What one?
[2176.02 → 2177.02] Yeah.
[2177.02 → 2182.02] I mean, I, as much as people ragged on them about it, I don't think 3090 was particularly misrepresented.
[2182.02 → 2186.02] They said it was 8K capable with DLSS help and it was.
[2186.02 → 2188.02] Did they compare it to other generations?
[2188.02 → 2189.02] I have to look this up now.
[2189.02 → 2192.02] I don't remember, but it was, it was like very powerful compared to other generations.
[2192.02 → 2194.02] So there was no reason for them to fudge it.
[2194.02 → 2197.02] I mean, they've had 1000 series was perfect too.
[2197.02 → 2198.02] Yeah, that's true.
[2198.02 → 2199.02] They fudged that.
[2199.02 → 2200.02] Yeah, that's probably true.
[2200.02 → 2201.02] I don't know how much it matters.
[2201.02 → 2202.02] Yeah, that's probably true.
[2202.02 → 2203.02] Yeah, that's probably true.
[2203.02 → 2214.02] Overall, I think the 30 series was a pretty, was a pretty honest launch, and they seemed to be competing hard.
[2214.02 → 2224.02] They seemed focused because they had the new console generation, and they seemed very focused on beating it with laser precision.
[2224.02 → 2228.02] And other than that, no, I actually, I do agree with you.
[2228.02 → 2229.02] Yeah.
[2229.02 → 2230.02] Okay.
[2230.02 → 2231.02] Fair enough.
[2231.02 → 2232.02] But yeah, it's like that, that, I don't know.
[2232.02 → 2233.02] It's just.
[2233.02 → 2234.02] I think, come back.
[2234.02 → 2235.02] Maybe there are other reasons.
[2235.02 → 2236.02] Maybe it's not financial, right?
[2236.02 → 2245.02] Like what are the other reasons that Nvidia could have for forcing this launch on this day other than financial?
[2245.02 → 2248.02] Maybe, maybe an image reason.
[2248.02 → 2252.02] Maybe they promised that these cards would launch on that day.
[2252.02 → 2255.02] Well, then they failed that anyway, because you can't buy them anyway.
[2255.02 → 2257.02] And you can't, you can't even review them.
[2257.02 → 2258.02] Okay.
[2258.02 → 2270.02] So, so what, what other, what other possible reason could motivate a company to, does someone internally have like a KPI that they have to launch the cards in, in this quarter?
[2270.02 → 2272.02] Well, there's plenty of time left in this quarter.
[2272.02 → 2284.02] Like what is the I'm trying to understand what reason there could possibly be to give us four or five days or whatever it was, two of which being a weekend to review these cards.
[2284.02 → 2291.02] Other than just trying to hide information from consumers and out of a complete lack of respect for partners.
[2291.02 → 2294.02] Those are the only two reasons that I can come up with.
[2294.02 → 2296.02] Or just completely not f***ING caring.
[2296.02 → 2297.02] Okay.
[2297.02 → 2298.02] So there's a third reason.
[2298.02 → 2300.02] That's it.
[2300.02 → 2301.02] That's all I got.
[2301.02 → 2303.02] So it's really hard.
[2303.02 → 2308.02] Um, it's really hard for me to say anything other than that's not okay.
[2308.02 → 2311.02] Um, that's, that's not going to fly.
[2311.02 → 2316.02] Um, and I've, I've seen, okay, another, another bad take, but not a bannable take.
[2316.02 → 2317.02] Another bad take is okay.
[2317.02 → 2320.02] You guys just shouldn't, you should never talk about Nvidia again.
[2320.02 → 2322.02] You should never review an Nvidia card.
[2322.02 → 2323.02] No, we absolutely still should.
[2323.02 → 2326.02] They have like 80% market share in the discrete GPU space.
[2326.02 → 2336.02] We have to, we have to review things that people are going to buy anyway, so that we can make sure that if they want to know what's going on, that we can give them the what's up.
[2336.02 → 2339.02] Like we're not just going to outright stop reviewing their products.
[2339.02 → 2343.02] And as I mentioned in that video, we're not even going to stop working with Nvidia.
[2343.02 → 2352.02] We are going to work with Nvidia because at the end of the day they're overpriced, and I think they have a terrible attitude, but the products are mostly good.
[2352.02 → 2357.02] Like how many of you have an Nvidia GPU that you're really happy with?
[2357.02 → 2359.02] I bet a lot of you do.
[2359.02 → 2361.02] All right, then.
[2361.02 → 2366.02] So we're going to have to, we're going to have to work with these guys.
[2366.02 → 2375.02] We're going to have to work with these guys, but it's, that doesn't mean that just because we're going to work with them that we're not going to call them out when they do something that's unacceptable.
[2375.02 → 2379.02] All right.
[2379.02 → 2380.02] What else was there in here?
[2380.02 → 2381.02] There are some silver lines.
[2381.02 → 2382.02] Ah, yes.
[2382.02 → 2383.02] Okay.
[2383.02 → 2384.02] So we decided not to post a review.
[2384.02 → 2389.02] So we still have unboxing, and we will do those for the other cards once they land.
[2389.02 → 2391.02] You can also head to LTTlabs.com.
[2391.02 → 2395.02] We'll have a full list of benchmarks for these cards once they are ready.
[2395.02 → 2399.02] Any big updates on the labs' website lately or not really?
[2399.02 → 2403.02] Not since the ones that we posted last, I think.
[2403.02 → 2405.02] PSU circuit's been doing great.
[2405.02 → 2406.02] Yeah.
[2406.02 → 2407.02] The channel's been getting more views and stuff.
[2407.02 → 2408.02] That's, that's pretty cool.
[2408.02 → 2409.02] Yeah.
[2409.02 → 2410.02] Yeah.
[2410.02 → 2411.02] Okay.
[2411.02 → 2414.02] So there, yeah, there's definitely, there's some new articles and stuff.
[2414.02 → 2417.02] We've got a review of the RM1000X up there.
[2417.02 → 2430.02] We're planning an article right now based on that email that Lucas sent you, which is a thing that we've been talking about doing for a while, which are we want to take the whole build in public model and apply it to the lab a little bit.
[2430.02 → 2435.02] So there's, there are a couple of ways that this will be showing its, its face soon.
[2435.02 → 2437.02] One of them is we're planning.
[2437.02 → 2440.02] So I don't want to, I don't want to leak it.
[2440.02 → 2442.02] We'll probably be talking about it next week's WAN show.
[2442.02 → 2443.02] Cool.
[2443.02 → 2449.02] Um, but I want it to be Lucas's words because it's, it's his stuff, not mine, but we're planning some potential changes to power supply testing.
[2449.02 → 2450.02] That's all I will say now.
[2450.02 → 2458.02] Um, but those details and the changes that will be happening are going to be talked about in a labs article.
[2458.02 → 2459.02] Cool.
[2459.02 → 2463.02] And then there will likely be a forum post accompanying it so that people can give feedback.
[2463.02 → 2464.02] I love it.
[2464.02 → 2467.02] We're going to be saying like, Hey, this is the situation that we're dealing with.
[2467.02 → 2468.02] Yep.
[2468.02 → 2470.02] This is the plan that we are planning on implementing.
[2470.02 → 2471.02] Let us know.
[2471.02 → 2472.02] But let us know.
[2472.02 → 2473.02] I want to do so much more of that, dude.
[2473.02 → 2477.02] I was disheartened to find out that the acoustic chambers done.
[2477.02 → 2479.02] Why were you disheartened?
[2479.02 → 2480.02] Because I didn't know.
[2480.02 → 2482.02] Oh, and we didn't like to make a video about it.
[2482.02 → 2484.02] Well, or write an article about it.
[2484.02 → 2486.02] We're going to be like, we're going to be writing an article.
[2486.02 → 2488.02] Get pictures of it being worked on.
[2488.02 → 2489.02] Like it wasn't a lot.
[2489.02 → 2490.02] We just glued panels.
[2490.02 → 2491.02] Well, yeah, but it made a big difference.
[2491.02 → 2492.02] Did it not?
[2492.02 → 2493.02] It did.
[2493.02 → 2494.02] Okay.
[2494.02 → 2495.02] But there's going to be an article.
[2495.02 → 2496.02] Fine.
[2496.02 → 2497.02] Good.
[2497.02 → 2498.02] But like, I would have liked to make a video about it.
[2498.02 → 2499.02] So this was part two.
[2499.02 → 2501.02] Keeping all the cool stuff for his website.
[2501.02 → 2502.02] While my videos languish.
[2502.02 → 2506.02] While I'm making videos about fire trucks, I'm so desperate.
[2506.02 → 2510.02] You can, no, you can't spray the sound chamber.
[2510.02 → 2511.02] Sorry.
[2511.02 → 2512.02] Maybe the RF chamber.
[2512.02 → 2514.02] The RF chamber could probably take getting sprayed.
[2514.02 → 2515.02] It's metal.
[2515.02 → 2516.02] Okay.
[2516.02 → 2518.02] The other side of it.
[2518.02 → 2519.02] Why would we do that?
[2519.02 → 2520.02] I don't know.
[2520.02 → 2521.02] Fire truck videos.
[2521.02 → 2524.02] But yeah, there's going to be an article on the sound chamber stuff.
[2524.02 → 2529.02] And there might be a short circuit, maybe.
[2529.02 → 2534.02] And the short circuit would feature what we're calling labs experimental graphs.
[2534.02 → 2539.02] So the graphs will indicate that these are tests under construction effectively.
[2539.02 → 2540.02] Okay.
[2540.02 → 2541.02] Sure.
[2541.02 → 2546.02] So it's a way for us to try to do stuff and put stuff out there that we're pretty confident in.
[2546.02 → 2550.02] But we're still kind of evaluating a little bit.
[2550.02 → 2554.02] So there will be an article talking about the current state of our sound testing.
[2554.02 → 2557.02] And there will be a short circuit video coming out with some of that sound testing in it.
[2557.02 → 2561.02] The article will explain what we're doing, how we're doing it, and we'll collect feedback.
[2561.02 → 2568.02] And then the video will show experimental graphs, and we can get some input on like what the graphs show.
[2568.02 → 2571.02] Can people understand what we're trying to convey with the graph?
[2571.02 → 2572.02] That type of stuff.
[2572.02 → 2573.02] Yeah.
[2573.02 → 2574.02] It's coming along.
[2574.02 → 2575.02] Things are happening.
[2575.02 → 2576.02] It'll be good.
[2576.02 → 2577.02] All right.
[2577.02 → 2578.02] Hold on.
[2578.02 → 2579.02] Sorry.
[2579.02 → 2580.02] I'm just...
[2580.02 → 2581.02] All right.
[2581.02 → 2582.02] Hold on.
[2582.02 → 2583.02] Sorry.
[2583.02 → 2584.02] I'm just...
[2584.02 → 2586.02] But again, we'll probably talk about that more probably on WAN when those articles are
[2586.02 → 2587.02] actually posted up.
[2587.02 → 2589.02] So I don't want to talk too much about it right now.
[2589.02 → 2590.02] All right.
[2590.02 → 2592.02] So, 4060 Ti 16 gig.
[2592.02 → 2593.02] There are some silver linings.
[2593.02 → 2594.02] According to Hardware Unboxed...
[2594.02 → 2595.02] 5060 Ti.
[2595.02 → 2596.02] And our numbers...
[2596.02 → 2597.02] Sorry.
[2597.02 → 2598.02] Yeah.
[2598.02 → 2599.02] Thank you.
[2599.02 → 2604.02] It appears to range from 10 to 20% faster than the 4060 Ti in both 1080p and 1440p while being
[2604.02 → 2607.02] $70 cheaper than last gen at MSRP.
[2607.02 → 2611.02] The issue is whether you can get it at that price.
[2611.02 → 2617.20] The good news though, the even better good news is that there is another card that you
[2617.20 → 2625.02] can buy for 1080p and even light 1440p gaming that appears to be getting much more affordable.
[2625.02 → 2631.30] Even though one user posted on r slash Intel Arc who was upset about not being able to find
[2631.30 → 2637.02] stock, several people in the comments said they are getting them no problem with minimal
[2637.02 → 2639.02] markup over MSRP.
[2639.02 → 2641.02] So our notes here say...
[2641.02 → 2642.02] Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[2642.02 → 2646.02] Go shopping for a B580.
[2646.02 → 2648.02] So here, lets uh...
[2648.02 → 2649.02] Let's take uh...
[2649.02 → 2650.02] Let's take uh...
[2650.02 → 2651.02] Let's take my...
[2651.02 → 2652.02] Let's take my laptop for a little spin.
[2652.02 → 2654.02] Intel B580.
[2654.02 → 2655.02] No, stay...
[2655.02 → 2656.02] Don't...
[2656.02 → 2657.02] Stop it.
[2657.02 → 2658.02] Okay.
[2658.02 → 2659.02] Intel B580.
[2659.02 → 2660.02] How we're doing here?
[2660.02 → 2661.02] What do you think, Luke?
[2661.02 → 2662.02] Here.
[2662.02 → 2663.02] Before...
[2663.02 → 2664.02] Don't look.
[2664.02 → 2667.02] Do you think B580 will be in stock?
[2667.02 → 2668.02] Uh...
[2668.02 → 2669.02] No.
[2669.02 → 2670.02] No.
[2670.02 → 2671.02] Okay.
[2671.02 → 2672.02] I'm going to go with no.
[2672.02 → 2673.02] If it's in stock...
[2673.02 → 2674.02] Okay.
[2674.02 → 2675.02] Let's create a branching situation here.
[2675.02 → 2676.02] Yep.
[2676.02 → 2680.02] If it's in stock, bearing in mind that it's MSRP, like Intel's MSRP price for a base card
[2680.02 → 2682.02] is 250 US dollars.
[2682.02 → 2684.02] What do you think the price will be?
[2684.02 → 2685.02] 350.
[2685.02 → 2686.02] 350.
[2686.02 → 2687.02] Okay.
[2687.02 → 2688.02] Let's go shopping.
[2688.02 → 2689.02] Uh...
[2689.02 → 2690.02] Okay.
[2690.02 → 2692.02] Well, the Gunner is in stock and is 379.
[2692.02 → 2693.02] But...
[2693.02 → 2696.02] This Onyx is 329.
[2696.02 → 2697.02] This one is 319.
[2697.02 → 2699.02] The last time I looked, there was no stock.
[2699.02 → 2701.02] So this is kinda cool that there is actually stock.
[2701.02 → 2702.02] And 319 is perfect.
[2702.02 → 2704.02] I don't know who the crap Onyx is.
[2704.02 → 2705.02] Me neither.
[2705.02 → 2709.02] But their Odyssey Arc 12 gig card is 320.
[2709.02 → 2710.02] Wow, that's smoking.
[2710.02 → 2711.02] Okay.
[2711.02 → 2712.02] So hold on a second.
[2712.02 → 2713.02] It's on sale too.
[2713.02 → 2714.02] Acer.
[2714.02 → 2715.02] Acer Nitro.
[2715.02 → 2716.02] Add to cart.
[2716.02 → 2717.02] 319.
[2717.02 → 2718.02] 319.
[2718.02 → 2719.02] 319.
[2719.02 → 2720.02] Decent looking cooler too.
[2720.02 → 2721.02] Intel.
[2721.02 → 2722.02] Oh, hold on.
[2722.02 → 2723.02] What is this?
[2723.02 → 2724.02] See price and cut 395.
[2724.02 → 2725.02] Get real.
[2725.02 → 2726.02] Um...
[2726.02 → 2727.02] Okay.
[2727.02 → 2728.02] What else we got here?
[2728.02 → 2729.02] What else we got here?
[2729.02 → 2730.02] Okay.
[2730.02 → 2731.02] This one's out of stock.
[2731.02 → 2732.02] This one for 269 is out of stock.
[2732.02 → 2733.02] Okay.
[2733.02 → 2734.02] But hold on a second.
[2734.02 → 2736.02] Because this is where things get crazy.
[2736.02 → 2742.02] Apparently, Intel Arc is still experiencing some shortages in the US.
[2742.02 → 2749.02] But in other markets, apparently it has chilled out a lot.
[2749.02 → 2753.02] And that appears to be very true.
[2753.02 → 2756.02] Check this out.
[2756.02 → 2759.02] Intel Arc limited edition.
[2759.02 → 2760.02] In Canada.
[2760.02 → 2761.02] 359.
[2761.02 → 2762.02] So that's CAD.
[2762.02 → 2764.02] That is Canadian dollars.
[2764.02 → 2765.02] Whoa.
[2765.02 → 2766.02] Hold on a second here.
[2766.02 → 2768.02] Dude, I looked like two weeks ago, and they're out of stock everywhere.
[2768.02 → 2771.02] See what the stock is at the individual places.
[2771.02 → 2772.02] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2772.02 → 2773.02] Hold on, hold on.
[2773.02 → 2774.02] CAD to USD.
[2774.02 → 2777.02] That is $10 over MSRP.
[2777.02 → 2780.02] Which, in normal times, still over MSRP.
[2780.02 → 2781.02] Still over MSRP.
[2781.02 → 2783.02] Would not be that exciting to me.
[2783.02 → 2784.02] Yeah.
[2784.02 → 2788.02] But in the two now, in the two now times, is actually quite exciting.
[2788.02 → 2790.02] Let's go ahead and check.
[2790.02 → 2792.02] They have one in Edmonton West.
[2792.02 → 2793.02] They have one in Victoria.
[2793.02 → 2794.02] Okay.
[2794.02 → 2795.02] Not a ton of stock.
[2795.02 → 2796.02] Not a ton of stock.
[2796.02 → 2797.02] Okay.
[2797.02 → 2800.02] So they're not out of stock now, but there's like almost none.
[2800.02 → 2801.02] But can I order it online?
[2801.02 → 2804.02] Added one to your cart.
[2804.02 → 2812.02] I can order this in Canada right now for $260 US dollars.
[2812.02 → 2818.02] And that is a lot of gaming card for $260 US dollars.
[2818.02 → 2819.02] Yeah.
[2819.02 → 2828.02] So I believe, I believe that we are finally seeing some inventory coming in of these Intel
[2828.02 → 2833.02] Arc cards, even if it's not enough to satisfy the appetite of the US market, which apparently
[2833.02 → 2838.02] is experiencing a surge in retail shopping right now.
[2838.02 → 2840.02] So the timing could be part of it.
[2840.02 → 2847.02] Intel might have allocated enough B580 to the US, only to realize too late that you're
[2847.02 → 2848.02] buying a lot of stock market.
[2848.02 → 2853.02] That US shoppers are hoovering up consumer products right now in anticipation that pricing
[2853.02 → 2857.02] could go up due to the tariff situation.
[2857.02 → 2861.02] And I've been experiencing that firsthand on LTT store.
[2861.02 → 2868.02] So reminder, we have extended the ship storm sale event worldwide free shipping on orders
[2868.02 → 2876.02] over $150 to help our American friends down there get anything that they need before whatever
[2876.02 → 2883.02] impacts ultimately affect us from the tariffs as well as to, you know, say, hey buddy,
[2883.02 → 2887.02] I hope you and the rest of the world love to have products from LTT store.com.
[2887.02 → 2896.02] So ship storm sale event, still ongoing and has been strong, crazy, has been crazy.
[2896.02 → 2903.02] So I am optimistic for Intel Arc.
[2903.02 → 2908.02] It's like, okay, new CEO, his name, Lip Bhutan.
[2908.02 → 2909.02] I think something like that.
[2909.02 → 2910.02] Not sure.
[2910.02 → 2911.02] It doesn't matter.
[2911.02 → 2915.02] The point is, if you're watching right now, if you happen to be watching, if anyone, if
[2915.02 → 2917.02] anyone, you know, you've got, you got the Intel CEO and your DMS.
[2917.02 → 2918.02] Okay.
[2918.02 → 2919.02] You clip this.
[2919.02 → 2920.02] Okay.
[2920.02 → 2921.02] You clip this.
[2921.02 → 2922.02] You send it to them.
[2922.02 → 2923.02] You clip this up on Arc desktop.
[2923.02 → 2924.02] Yeah.
[2924.02 → 2925.02] You clip this up on Arc desktop.
[2925.02 → 2926.02] Yeah.
[2926.02 → 2927.02] Gamers need you.
[2927.02 → 2928.02] The gaming market needs you.
[2928.02 → 2929.02] Okay.
[2929.02 → 2930.02] It might be too late.
[2930.02 → 2934.02] It might be too late to bring back the higher end battle mage discrete GPUs.
[2934.02 → 2936.02] It is not too late for Celestial.
[2936.02 → 2937.02] Okay.
[2937.02 → 2938.02] Do it.
[2938.02 → 2944.02] Do the full lineup for Celestial because that team, that team has been working so hard.
[2944.02 → 2945.02] They're cooking, dude.
[2945.02 → 2952.02] They do the fact, the fact that in a few short years, they have gone from Intel HD graphics,
[2952.02 → 2957.02] essentially, you know, in terms of the drive to a legitimate discrete competitor.
[2957.02 → 2959.02] I know the margins aren't great right now.
[2959.02 → 2961.02] We know that for a fact because we know the die sizes.
[2961.02 → 2962.02] Okay.
[2962.02 → 2964.02] And we know what process it's built on.
[2964.02 → 2965.02] It's built at TSMC.
[2965.02 → 2970.02] So they are, they're under the same cost pressure that AMD or Nvidia are on these Arc GPUs.
[2970.02 → 2974.02] I can understand why they might not be that incentivized to build a ton of them, but, but they're on,
[2974.02 → 2976.02] they're, they're onto something.
[2976.02 → 2977.02] They're onto something.
[2977.02 → 2978.02] This is, this is good.
[2978.02 → 2979.02] This is important.
[2979.02 → 2984.02] This is a billion-dollar industry that as far as I can tell, Nvidia is completely not paying
[2984.02 → 2986.02] attention to right now.
[2986.02 → 2991.02] They, they have, they are, they are on complete autopilot.
[2991.02 → 2992.02] Do it.
[2992.02 → 2993.02] Do it.
[2993.02 → 2996.02] I want to show one more thing for the lab site before we move on.
[2996.02 → 2997.02] Okay.
[2997.02 → 2998.02] Because I, I forgot that I could show this.
[2998.02 → 2999.02] Hold on.
[2999.02 → 3000.02] One more thing.
[3000.02 → 3004.02] Steven J says, Linus, Memory Express also has a bunch of B580 challengers on their site.
[3004.02 → 3011.02] Uh, for 409 CAD, which is, um, about 35 or 40 US dollars over MSRP.
[3011.02 → 3012.02] But that's like an OC card.
[3012.02 → 3013.02] Yeah.
[3013.02 → 3014.02] So that's not even.
[3014.02 → 3015.02] It was probably going to be over MSRP.
[3015.02 → 3016.02] Yeah.
[3016.02 → 3017.02] Not even ridiculous.
[3017.02 → 3018.02] Yeah.
[3018.02 → 3019.02] Oh yeah.
[3019.02 → 3020.02] I see them.
[3020.02 → 3021.02] I see them.
[3021.02 → 3022.02] I see them here, here, here, here, here.
[3022.02 → 3023.02] So here's a they have these challengers as well.
[3023.02 → 3024.02] As our challenger OC.
[3024.02 → 3025.02] Nice.
[3025.02 → 3026.02] Yeah.
[3026.02 → 3027.02] Um, dude, they got tons of these.
[3027.02 → 3028.02] Let's go.
[3028.02 → 3029.02] 10 plus at like every store.
[3029.02 → 3034.02] I could, I could literally go to the Langley store, walk in and buy one right now.
[3034.02 → 3035.02] For here, 409.
[3035.02 → 3037.02] Oh, that's such a normal sounding thing.
[3037.02 → 3038.02] Right.
[3038.02 → 3039.02] But it hasn't been for a while.
[3039.02 → 3041.02] You can't cause its close because it's a holiday.
[3041.02 → 3042.02] Oh, I got him!
[3042.02 → 3043.02] Get rest like this.
[3043.02 → 3044.02] Get rest like this.
[3044.02 → 3053.02] So for 40, for $46 over MSRP, I could have a challenger OC card when they open tomorrow.
[3053.02 → 3054.02] Yeah.
[3054.02 → 3057.02] Um, speaking of things being not the right prices.
[3057.02 → 3061.02] Remember, I think it was two weeks ago, we talked about the bring your own price feature
[3061.02 → 3062.02] for the labs' website.
[3062.02 → 3063.02] Yes.
[3063.02 → 3065.02] Um, this is not, not yet.
[3065.02 → 3066.02] Oh, okay.
[3066.02 → 3067.02] This is not.
[3067.02 → 3069.02] I wouldn't have had time to process it yet anyway.
[3069.02 → 3071.02] This is not ready yet.
[3071.02 → 3072.02] This was a hackathon project.
[3072.02 → 3077.02] So Liam, the same person who championed it internally originally, he mentioned, I think he got it
[3077.02 → 3080.02] from a comment somewhere or something, but, uh, he was the one that brought it up in the meeting.
[3080.02 → 3085.02] He then chose this as his hackathon project and made a version of it.
[3085.02 → 3088.02] Now, before you're like, Oh, I don't like how this thing or that thing works.
[3088.02 → 3089.02] It was a hackathon project.
[3089.02 → 3090.02] Leave it alone.
[3090.02 → 3094.02] It's, it has not gone through UX UI, any of that kind of stuff.
[3094.02 → 3099.02] Um, but this is, so you can see add prices as a button here.
[3099.02 → 3100.02] It's 15 seconds.
[3100.02 → 3101.02] So just prepping you a little bit.
[3101.02 → 3102.02] Okay.
[3102.02 → 3103.02] You've got these cards, these, whatever.
[3103.02 → 3104.02] Okay.
[3104.02 → 3105.02] Okay.
[3105.02 → 3106.02] Okay.
[3106.02 → 3107.02] Here we go.
[3107.02 → 3109.02] Plug in your own prices for the cards that are listed.
[3109.02 → 3110.02] Oh buddy.
[3110.02 → 3111.02] Oh buddy.
[3111.02 → 3112.02] Oh buddy.
[3112.02 → 3113.02] Oh buddy.
[3113.02 → 3114.02] Sick.
[3114.02 → 3115.02] Close it.
[3115.02 → 3116.02] And then the graph updates.
[3116.02 → 3117.02] Oh.
[3117.02 → 3118.02] And it works.
[3118.02 → 3119.02] Hackathon project functional.
[3119.02 → 3121.02] You can disable or enable price per frame.
[3121.02 → 3124.02] We were kind of thinking that, um, Dan brought this up.
[3124.02 → 3125.02] Dan Siegel on the team.
[3125.02 → 3126.02] That's pretty cool.
[3126.02 → 3127.02] Um, was thinking that.
[3127.02 → 3128.02] That's pretty cool.
[3128.02 → 3130.02] It should probably just add a line.
[3130.02 → 3131.02] Hmm.
[3131.02 → 3133.02] So it should show all the previous data, but add a line.
[3133.02 → 3135.02] So you can still see the other things.
[3135.02 → 3137.02] I think that's a pretty neat idea.
[3137.02 → 3140.02] The modal could look better, whatever that those, none of that.
[3140.02 → 3141.02] It's a hackathon.
[3141.02 → 3142.02] Nobody cared.
[3142.02 → 3143.02] Um, that's pretty cool.
[3143.02 → 3144.02] Okay.
[3144.02 → 3145.02] Can I not prioritize?
[3145.02 → 3146.02] Number one is not coming soon.
[3146.02 → 3147.02] Go away.
[3147.02 → 3152.02] Can I propose maybe a fundamental problem?
[3152.02 → 3153.02] Sure.
[3153.02 → 3154.02] I know.
[3154.02 → 3155.02] I know.
[3155.02 → 3156.02] This is a big, uh, oh, this.
[3156.02 → 3157.02] Not really.
[3157.02 → 3158.02] We have lots of other stuff to work on.
[3158.02 → 3159.02] Okay.
[3159.02 → 3162.02] Cause, and this is, I think this is going to be somewhat controversial because I think
[3162.02 → 3165.02] a lot of the audience is going to disagree with me on this.
[3165.02 → 3166.02] Okay.
[3166.02 → 3167.02] But, oh boy.
[3167.02 → 3170.02] How do I say this without, um, without causing a stir?
[3170.02 → 3179.02] I felt that that was an accurate way to assess FPS per dollar and price to performance until
[3179.02 → 3181.02] I thought about it more.
[3181.02 → 3188.02] I think you need to think about it more because this was something that kind of blew my mind
[3188.02 → 3193.02] when I was, when I was trying to wrap my brain around, and this would have been way back in the
[3193.02 → 3194.02] day.
[3194.02 → 3195.02] Okay.
[3195.02 → 3200.02] I believe the card that we were discussing was, um, what was it?
[3200.02 → 3202.02] It might've been the 8800 Ultra.
[3202.02 → 3204.02] Do you remember the 8800 Ultra?
[3204.02 → 3208.02] It was the 8800 GTX with a different plastic shroud on it.
[3208.02 → 3212.02] And it was like overclocked 10% or something.
[3212.02 → 3216.02] And it was like $300 more or something like that.
[3216.02 → 3221.02] Those numbers might be a little bit wrong, but the fundamental, the fundamentals are right.
[3221.02 → 3229.02] That it was the same GPU on the same PCB with functionally the same cooler, but a cooler shroud
[3229.02 → 3231.02] for hundreds of dollars more.
[3231.02 → 3232.02] Okay.
[3232.02 → 3233.02] 8800 Ultra.
[3233.02 → 3242.02] And I, I was working on our, our PC like configurator, and I was like adamantly opposed to a card like
[3242.02 → 3243.02] that.
[3243.02 → 3244.02] I was like, this is actually stupid.
[3244.02 → 3249.02] And all you got to do is get MSI afterburner and turn it up 10%, which every 8800 GTX will
[3249.02 → 3250.02] do.
[3250.02 → 3252.02] So why does anyone care about this at all?
[3252.02 → 3255.02] We shouldn't even, we shouldn't even stock it was pretty much my perspective on it.
[3255.02 → 3256.02] I was like, this is the stupidest thing ever.
[3256.02 → 3257.02] No one should buy it.
[3257.02 → 3258.02] Okay.
[3258.02 → 3259.02] Okay.
[3259.02 → 3262.02] But hear me out.
[3262.02 → 3269.02] So while the FPS per dollar of an 8800 Ultra and an 8800 GTX, if you look at it this
[3269.02 → 3273.02] way, a thousand dollars versus $700.
[3273.02 → 3278.02] And this one gets 10% more performance for what would it work out to you?
[3278.02 → 3279.02] 40% more price.
[3279.02 → 3284.02] Basically it's a stupid thing for completely stupid people.
[3284.02 → 3290.02] But, and this was explained to me in a way that I kind of was combative against and didn't
[3290.02 → 3294.02] understand for a while until it finally clicked.
[3294.02 → 3301.02] Well, the math is actually, that math is actually completely flawed because most people are buying
[3301.02 → 3304.02] a computer system.
[3304.02 → 3306.02] And in the context of, hold on, hold on.
[3306.02 → 3307.02] No, no.
[3307.02 → 3308.02] Trust me.
[3308.02 → 3309.02] Trust me.
[3309.02 → 3316.02] If you're a computer system that costs $3,000, spending another $300 to have 10% more performance
[3316.02 → 3319.02] could actually make perfect sense.
[3319.02 → 3320.02] Okay.
[3320.02 → 3330.02] So for that reason, I think we actually need to consider the cost of the system when we
[3330.02 → 3331.02] do these calculations.
[3331.02 → 3340.02] Because otherwise I think that we are, because the cost of that FPS is not just the GPU.
[3340.02 → 3342.02] That is not actually accurate.
[3342.02 → 3344.02] Unless you're doing an upgrade.
[3344.02 → 3348.02] If you are doing an upgrade, it kind of is.
[3348.02 → 3354.02] But that comparison would realistically, like you still paid for that system though.
[3354.02 → 3358.02] I don't think just because you do the math one time that you can't consider anything else
[3358.02 → 3360.02] in the scenario.
[3360.02 → 3367.02] Like, of course you have to consider your total system cost and the impact of that difference
[3367.02 → 3372.02] on the total system cost might be X percentage of the total system cost that you're expending.
[3372.02 → 3377.02] But that I don't think that makes the frame for dollar equation irrelevant.
[3377.02 → 3382.02] I think it makes it seem more drastic than it is.
[3382.02 → 3384.02] But I think that's up for the user to understand.
[3384.02 → 3386.02] We could help communicate that.
[3386.02 → 3387.02] I don't think a lot of them do.
[3387.02 → 3388.02] And that's the challenge.
[3388.02 → 3395.02] Every time I bring up this argument, I have people kind of, again, I'm sorry, not understanding
[3395.02 → 3396.02] it.
[3396.02 → 3397.02] Because they seem to be under...
[3397.02 → 3399.02] Is that something we can solve by communicating to the users?
[3399.02 → 3400.02] I don't know.
[3400.02 → 3405.02] Can we say on there, like, make sure that you consider...
[3405.02 → 3411.02] What if we suggested that people put in the total system cost?
[3411.02 → 3413.02] I think that would be fine.
[3413.02 → 3419.02] Because my issue is, in its current form, it feels like a graph that doesn't start at zero.
[3419.02 → 3420.02] You're like too zoomed in.
[3420.02 → 3421.02] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3421.02 → 3422.02] Exactly.
[3422.02 → 3423.02] Something like that.
[3423.02 → 3428.02] I think that's the most succinct way of explaining what I'm trying to...
[3428.02 → 3430.02] The point I'm trying to make here.
[3430.02 → 3431.02] No, I think your point is super valid.
[3431.02 → 3432.02] I just, I think there...
[3432.02 → 3433.02] Yeah.
[3433.02 → 3434.02] I don't think that means don't build it, in my opinion.
[3434.02 → 3436.02] Oh, no, it doesn't mean that at all.
[3436.02 → 3437.02] I think that means...
[3437.02 → 3439.02] Yeah, to like change how you communicate it or something like this.
[3439.02 → 3447.02] It means we need to fundamentally think about how we are presenting this information to make sure that people aren't getting the wrong impression.
[3447.02 → 3448.02] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3448.02 → 3449.02] That's super fair.
[3449.02 → 3450.02] I think, I think like...
[3450.02 → 3451.02] Let me see here.
[3451.02 → 3452.02] I'm going to bring it back up.
[3452.02 → 3456.02] I bet you, you could almost solve it by like, just to the...
[3456.02 → 3457.02] Can you see my mouse?
[3457.02 → 3465.02] Just to the left of this box, you could put like total system cost with this card or make it more simple than that.
[3465.02 → 3466.02] Yeah.
[3466.02 → 3468.02] Like inform them of what to put in the box.
[3468.02 → 3469.02] Yeah.
[3469.02 → 3471.02] You could maybe even have examples or something.
[3471.02 → 3472.02] I don't know.
[3472.02 → 3476.02] We could do a little bloggy post explaining how people will do it, but then, you know, that'll be buried.
[3476.02 → 3483.02] Two years after it's posted and no one will see it, but we can like try to help guide people as much as we can.
[3483.02 → 3487.02] But I, yeah, I don't think, I don't think that means...
[3487.02 → 3489.02] We should still build the feature.
[3489.02 → 3490.02] Yeah, but I understand.
[3490.02 → 3491.02] Yeah.
[3491.02 → 3492.02] And I think that's a good point.
[3492.02 → 3495.02] Pathos has a really great example in the float plane chat that uses real math.
[3495.02 → 3496.02] Sure.
[3496.02 → 3499.02] My recent build was $7,000 of that.
[3499.02 → 3501.02] We don't know what currency they're talking.
[3501.02 → 3503.02] So I don't know, but probably a lot.
[3503.02 → 3507.02] But the GPU was $3,500.
[3507.02 → 3518.02] Had I gone with a 9070 XT, I would have 63% of the gaming performance I have today at 58% of the cost.
[3518.02 → 3520.02] So oddly enough, Linus's argument works.
[3520.02 → 3521.02] Yeah.
[3521.02 → 3523.02] No, his argument definitely works.
[3523.02 → 3525.02] I don't think it's odd even, it just definitely works.
[3525.02 → 3526.02] Yeah.
[3526.02 → 3527.02] But it's like, but that's okay.
[3527.02 → 3531.02] So I kind of defaulted to that being something that people would consider when they're looking at this stuff.
[3531.02 → 3533.02] But I understand the argument that they won't.
[3533.02 → 3534.02] So, okay.
[3534.02 → 3535.02] And the challenge with upgrades...
[3535.02 → 3536.02] Just communicate to people.
[3536.02 → 3538.02] ...is that I think that...
[3538.02 → 3539.02] It still applies.
[3539.02 → 3543.02] Especially at the high end, the numbers are going to be kind of skewed.
[3543.02 → 3544.02] Yeah.
[3544.02 → 3548.02] But if you aren't building a new system, you weren't actually getting all of that performance.
[3548.02 → 3551.02] Because you're bound to be bottlenecked by the rest of your system.
[3551.02 → 3552.02] But this is where I was kind of...
[3552.02 → 3553.02] Okay, so fair enough.
[3553.02 → 3555.02] But this is kind of where I was thinking like...
[3555.02 → 3558.02] I was hoping people were understanding the whole equation as well.
[3558.02 → 3561.02] Because if you're upgrading, you're probably flipping your GPU too.
[3561.02 → 3562.02] Probably.
[3562.02 → 3563.02] So now it's really...
[3563.02 → 3564.02] The price is really the delta.
[3564.02 → 3565.02] Yes.
[3565.02 → 3566.02] So it's like...
[3566.02 → 3567.02] But I...
[3567.02 → 3568.02] So I want people to...
[3568.02 → 3573.02] But how do we do this without it being like a macro laden Excel sheet that you like punch?
[3573.02 → 3574.02] I just wanna...
[3574.02 → 3577.02] Or with like an article you have to read.
[3577.02 → 3578.02] Like I wanna...
[3578.02 → 3579.02] Yeah, like a user manual.
[3579.02 → 3580.02] Yeah.
[3580.02 → 3581.02] Like a PDF you download before you interact with this.
[3581.02 → 3583.02] A user manual for your five text boxes.
[3583.02 → 3589.02] You have to scroll all the way through the page and certify that you have read the user manual before you interact with this page, right?
[3589.02 → 3593.02] Like I just want to make sure that we are considering...
[3593.02 → 3594.02] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3594.02 → 3595.02] No, that's a good...
[3595.02 → 3596.02] That's all good.
[3596.02 → 3598.02] The different ways of doing the math here.
[3598.02 → 3605.02] Because I want this to be a really useful tool and I don't want anyone to go, oh yeah, well...
[3605.02 → 3610.02] Okay man, what would be an example of like where they would accidentally spend too much?
[3610.02 → 3616.02] Probably that wouldn't happen because I think it mostly damages the value proposition of the higher end stuff.
[3616.02 → 3618.02] I think it would generally skew down.
[3618.02 → 3620.02] But I'd hate for people to...
[3620.02 → 3622.02] Like that example in the chat.
[3622.02 → 3632.02] I'd hate for people to spend $1,000 on their computer and then buy the thing for $100 that performs...
[3632.02 → 3633.02] You know...
[3633.02 → 3635.02] Oh man, how do I explain this?
[3635.02 → 3636.02] Whatever.
[3636.02 → 3645.02] The point is, at a certain point, if you're spending enough on the rest of your system, there's better value to be had by actually spending a little bit...
[3645.02 → 3647.02] But a lot more on your GPU.
[3647.02 → 3650.02] Like you could get a better value spending double on your GPU.
[3650.02 → 3654.02] $200 versus $100 for a GPU that performs only 20% better.
[3654.02 → 3663.02] Because now your budget is $1,200 and is 20% better versus $1,100 and it's 20% less or whatever.
[3663.02 → 3664.02] Yeah.
[3664.02 → 3665.02] Yeah, 20% less.
[3665.02 → 3666.02] Depends on your tasking, right?
[3666.02 → 3667.02] Yeah.
[3667.02 → 3672.02] If you're not thinking that's super, super CPU heavy, that might not be true, but then it's true for the CPU instead.
[3672.02 → 3676.02] It depends on the thing that you're focusing on.
[3676.02 → 3677.02] We'll figure it out.
[3677.02 → 3678.02] Guys, we're going to figure it out.
[3678.02 → 3679.02] There's got to be...
[3679.02 → 3680.02] Yeah, there has to be some way.
[3680.02 → 3686.02] There has to be a way to present this information and make sure that we don't bamboozle...
[3686.02 → 3687.02] Probably a variety of ways.
[3687.02 → 3690.02] We don't bamboozle everyone into buying a B580.
[3690.02 → 3691.02] Yeah.
[3691.02 → 3692.02] Yeah.
[3692.02 → 3693.02] There.
[3693.02 → 3694.02] That's the point I'm trying to get to.
[3694.02 → 3700.02] If you're spending $500 on your base platform, you buy a B580, right?
[3700.02 → 3705.02] But if you're spending $2,000 on your platform, and you're buying a B580, it's the best bang for the buck.
[3705.02 → 3706.02] You're doing something wrong.
[3706.02 → 3710.02] It's the best bang for the buck in a vacuum against other GPUs.
[3710.02 → 3716.02] But in the context of that $2,000 system, it is not the best bang for the buck, and you are leaving a ton of performance
[3716.02 → 3720.02] and a ton of wasted budget on those other things completely on the table.
[3720.02 → 3723.02] Regardless of whether you're buying them today or you bought them already.
[3723.02 → 3725.02] It's not a good balance.
[3725.02 → 3728.02] I want to help people find a balanced configuration.
[3728.02 → 3731.02] Yeah, like we're going to be talking about this at the all hands.
[3731.02 → 3739.02] So a little bit of a spoiler, but like one of the things that the lab's website wants to work on over the next who knows how long
[3739.02 → 3743.02] is trying to help get people to final decision more.
[3743.02 → 3747.02] So right now it's a perfect info dump page for nerds.
[3747.02 → 3748.02] Yes.
[3748.02 → 3750.02] But it doesn't really help you, which is great.
[3750.02 → 3751.02] Yeah.
[3751.02 → 3753.02] But it doesn't really help you get to a final decision.
[3753.02 → 3754.02] It doesn't guide me.
[3754.02 → 3755.02] It can refine you down a little bit.
[3755.02 → 3756.02] Yeah.
[3756.02 → 3762.02] Maybe if you use the comparison page properly and stuff, it can help get you sort of there, but it doesn't really drive you to a final decision.
[3762.02 → 3768.02] And there's, there are a number of things that we can do better and do more of do differently, whatever that can help get us there.
[3769.02 → 3771.02] There's a ton really.
[3771.02 → 3773.02] One of them is these types of things.
[3774.02 → 3776.02] So we want to, we want to do more of it.
[3776.02 → 3779.02] Someone mentioned a unique username said, maybe also consider power consumption.
[3779.02 → 3781.02] If you want to over-complicate it.
[3781.02 → 3783.02] I think that's a different chart.
[3783.02 → 3784.02] Oh yeah.
[3784.02 → 3785.02] I think that is something that we could do.
[3785.02 → 3786.02] Yeah.
[3786.02 → 3797.02] We're not going to total cost of ownership analysis and like try to integrate, you know, on the, on the top X axis, like the acoustics and like, we're going to end up with a chart nobody can read.
[3797.02 → 3798.02] Yeah.
[3798.02 → 3802.02] I think it's already going to be complicated when we try to work in this messaging around total system cost.
[3802.02 → 3807.02] Um, but it is something that I would like, I would like to see us integrate.
[3807.02 → 3810.02] I really, I think there's, I think there are ways to do it.
[3810.02 → 3817.02] Like, I think there's even things that we could do where like, if you put in the wizard version, there could maybe be a wizard version.
[3817.02 → 3819.02] That's more dev time.
[3819.02 → 3822.02] In the graph version, it could basically be that.
[3822.02 → 3826.02] And we expect people to kind of figure it out on their own, or they could have an input field for whatever.
[3826.02 → 3830.02] But in the wizard version, you basically just go, Hey, here's my system.
[3830.02 → 3835.02] Or like, here's, here's how much my system cost recommend.
[3835.02 → 3837.02] Here's my config and how much I paid for it.
[3837.02 → 3842.02] Recommend the best bang for the buck GPU upgrade, because then we have all the information.
[3842.02 → 3844.02] We know what kind of budget you're shopping in.
[3844.02 → 3855.02] And we can just be like, yeah, this may be surprising, but you actually are best off with a RTX 5090 because anything else would be sort of leaving a ton of performance on the table.
[3855.02 → 3856.02] Your system.
[3856.02 → 3857.02] Yeah.
[3857.02 → 3858.02] Yeah.
[3858.02 → 3859.02] It's like go to the beach in dress shoes.
[3859.02 → 3860.02] I drank like three of these today.
[3860.02 → 3861.02] I'll be right back.
[3861.02 → 3862.02] You're going to wash them.
[3862.02 → 3863.02] Yeah.
[3863.02 → 3872.02] Um, something we could do as you're getting up and walking is make it so that if you, this might be really, really annoying, but we could make it so that there's general expectations for prices for GPUs.
[3872.02 → 3885.02] And if you put that in instead of a system, it could put a little warning triangle and the warning triangle would link you to the article explaining why he understands now, but, um, it could link you to the article explaining why you should probably put in your system costs.
[3885.02 → 3886.02] But then it's up to the user, right?
[3886.02 → 3887.02] The user could just choose to ignore it.
[3887.02 → 3889.02] The user could just choose to ignore it.
[3889.02 → 3890.02] Where's the this way.
[3890.02 → 3891.02] Nice.
[3891.02 → 3896.02] Uh, the user could just choose to ignore it and then just look at the GPU in a vacuum.
[3896.02 → 3899.02] Uh, because that will still be interesting for people.
[3899.02 → 3902.02] Um, that is still a useful and interesting number.
[3902.02 → 3905.02] Uh, it's just could be misleading when you're looking to buy a whole computer.
[3905.02 → 3908.02] Um, so yeah, I don't know.
[3908.02 → 3910.02] There's a variety of ways that we could do it.
[3910.02 → 3913.02] Some of them are very annoying on the dev team, like the one that I just mentioned.
[3913.02 → 3917.02] So I don't know the, the dev team and anyone doing data entry.
[3917.02 → 3921.02] So I don't know if we necessarily actually want to do that because it's super tedious.
[3921.02 → 3925.02] Um, but there's probably a variety of other ways of doing it as well.
[3925.02 → 3927.02] So we'll figure it out.
[3927.02 → 3931.02] Um, but yeah, there's, there's, there's a ton of things that we could do.
[3931.02 → 3933.02] There's a ton of things that we can do with the labs' website.
[3933.02 → 3937.02] Um, we're planning on, we're planning on a lot of stuff.
[3937.02 → 3950.02] I probably should stop talking to be completely honest because every, every, every time I talk about potential future features for, for anything, all that anyone, uh, talks about in.
[3950.02 → 3952.02] Just drop the potential in chats.
[3952.02 → 3953.02] Yeah.
[3953.02 → 3954.02] Yeah.
[3954.02 → 3955.02] They completely dropped the potential.
[3955.02 → 3960.02] They assume it is the number one priority thing that we're working on now when like in reality, um,
[3960.02 → 3977.02] um, a lot of the tasking for high priority stuff for the lab right now is like working on better graphing tools for the local team and, uh, improving some of the data entry stuff that local team has to do in order to get articles up.
[3977.02 → 3990.02] And, uh, doing some revisions to some of the product pages that we currently have, um, like introducing new graphs to the power supply verticals, doing some revamping stuff, maybe the keyboard and mouse.
[3990.02 → 3992.02] Because I haven't been touched in a long time, things like that.
[3992.02 → 3998.02] Um, not, not, not the like, uh, sexy new feature development stuff.
[3998.02 → 4000.02] So it'll, but it's, it's coming.
[4000.02 → 4001.02] It'll happen.
[4001.02 → 4005.02] In summary, buy an Intel arc B580.
[4005.02 → 4007.02] In every scenario.
[4007.02 → 4008.02] Yeah.
[4008.02 → 4012.02] In every scenario, because it's always, always the best bang for the buck.
[4012.02 → 4013.02] Yeah.
[4013.02 → 4014.02] There you go.
[4014.02 → 4018.02] Yes, I washed here.
[4018.02 → 4019.02] Nice.
[4019.02 → 4020.02] Yep.
[4020.02 → 4021.02] Or it's pee.
[4021.02 → 4022.02] One of the two.
[4022.02 → 4023.02] One of the two.
[4023.02 → 4024.02] Or both.
[4024.02 → 4025.02] I could have washed poorly.
[4025.02 → 4026.02] I was going to say both.
[4026.02 → 4027.02] That's possible.
[4027.02 → 4029.02] I mean, I guess there are other bodily fluids that could have been more than just water and pee.
[4029.02 → 4030.02] At least three.
[4030.02 → 4032.02] Actually, that would have taken longer.
[4034.02 → 4036.02] You could have started while you're walking.
[4036.02 → 4039.02] I didn't know for sure that the building was empty.
[4039.02 → 4040.02] So.
[4040.02 → 4042.02] That's even more reason to.
[4042.02 → 4043.02] Yeah.
[4043.02 → 4045.02] I don't need, I don't need.
[4045.02 → 4047.02] This is your building Linus.
[4047.02 → 4048.02] Look.
[4048.02 → 4049.02] I have enough.
[4049.02 → 4050.02] HR's gone.
[4050.02 → 4052.02] HR's gone home.
[4052.02 → 4054.02] We talked about this.
[4054.02 → 4055.02] It's after hours.
[4055.02 → 4056.02] It's after hours.
[4056.02 → 4059.02] I have enough scandals when I like didn't actually do anything.
[4060.02 → 4063.02] I don't need to actually expose myself in the office.
[4063.02 → 4065.02] Oh man.
[4065.02 → 4066.02] All right.
[4066.02 → 4067.02] What are we supposed to be doing?
[4067.02 → 4069.02] Let's explain merch messages.
[4069.02 → 4070.02] Ah yes.
[4070.02 → 4071.02] Merch messages.
[4071.02 → 4073.02] Well, I can see that quite a few of you have figured them out already.
[4073.02 → 4074.02] Oh.
[4074.02 → 4075.02] How are your fingers doing there, Dan?
[4075.02 → 4076.02] Pretty good.
[4076.02 → 4078.02] It's not quite as bad as last week.
[4078.02 → 4082.02] Well, I haven't reminded the people that there's free shipping on LTTstore.com.
[4082.02 → 4084.02] Now it's going to be as bad as last week.
[4084.02 → 4085.02] I'm sorry.
[4085.02 → 4091.02] Free shipping on LTTstore.com on all orders over $150.
[4091.02 → 4093.02] That is worldwide.
[4093.02 → 4095.02] We are extending the deadline.
[4095.02 → 4100.02] It is now until Tuesday, April 22nd at 10 a.m. Pacific time.
[4100.02 → 4104.02] This is largely because the team has been doing an incredible job getting orders out.
[4104.02 → 4111.02] And we are less concerned that those orders are not going to make it over the border before May 2nd,
[4111.02 → 4118.02] which is when according to the current guidance, a bunch more tariff stuff is supposed to kick in or something like that.
[4118.02 → 4125.02] So we've got a bit more time to take in orders that we will be able to get over before any tariffs will impact the costs on them.
[4125.02 → 4132.02] So now is a better time than ever to check out the MCM Essentials solution, which is running at just $80.
[4132.02 → 4135.02] We also have our magnetic cable management starter kit.
[4135.02 → 4136.02] $15.
[4136.02 → 4138.02] Which is just to give you guys kind of taste.
[4138.02 → 4139.02] You can check it out.
[4139.02 → 4140.02] You get a power bar key.
[4140.02 → 4142.02] So that is for those little like keyhole things.
[4142.02 → 4143.02] You put it in there, you screw it on.
[4143.02 → 4147.02] And they're also great for holding up anything that uses a quarter 20 mount.
[4147.02 → 4148.02] So it's threaded for that.
[4148.02 → 4151.02] So you could like, you could like mount a, you know, camera with it.
[4151.02 → 4152.02] Yeah.
[4152.02 → 4153.02] Nice strong magnet.
[4153.02 → 4156.02] The base just unscrews, and then it's like a circle with a yeah.
[4156.02 → 4157.02] Yeah.
[4157.02 → 4160.02] Super, super handy cable tie holder, medium and small arches.
[4160.02 → 4162.02] And with a bunch of the different grip plates.
[4162.02 → 4166.02] So you can get an idea of exactly what it is that you, that you, that you would want.
[4166.02 → 4168.02] Great time to pick up a commuter backpack.
[4168.02 → 4169.02] This has been one of the top movers.
[4169.02 → 4171.02] And of course there's all the classics, right?
[4171.02 → 4173.02] Northern lights desk pad available in any size you want.
[4173.02 → 4178.02] We've got the great configurator on there so that you can see how it's going to look on your desk,
[4178.02 → 4182.02] depending on the width that you have, what kind of desk pad you want, move it around.
[4182.02 → 4183.02] You can add a monitor.
[4183.02 → 4184.02] We still have that right now.
[4184.02 → 4185.02] Yeah.
[4185.02 → 4186.02] There is show peripherals.
[4186.02 → 4187.02] You can kind of see what it's going to look like.
[4187.02 → 4188.02] But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.
[4188.02 → 4191.02] That is a fantastic little tool that the team whipped up.
[4191.02 → 4192.02] The OG backpack.
[4192.02 → 4194.02] It's been surprising to me.
[4194.02 → 4197.02] I thought the commuter backpack was going to cannibalize it.
[4197.02 → 4198.02] Were you talking about the desk configurator?
[4198.02 → 4199.02] Yeah.
[4199.02 → 4200.02] Oh, it was just Conrad.
[4200.02 → 4201.02] Oh, great job, Conrad.
[4201.02 → 4205.02] So the OG backpack, I thought the commuter was going to cannibalize it.
[4205.02 → 4210.02] It has actually caused the OG backpack to really go up in sales.
[4210.02 → 4213.02] That kind of makes sense to me, actually.
[4213.02 → 4220.02] I would have originally assumed the same as you did, but I get why I think.
[4220.02 → 4221.02] Why?
[4221.02 → 4222.02] I don't.
[4222.02 → 4226.02] Cause if you hear, if you see a review, cause there's some people that have covered it and
[4226.02 → 4230.02] you know, people will talk about it, whatnot about this good backpack.
[4230.02 → 4235.02] You might look into it and then go, Hmm, I wanted a bigger one and then go, Oh, the same
[4235.02 → 4236.02] company made a bigger one.
[4236.02 → 4237.02] It looks great.
[4237.02 → 4238.02] I'll get that one.
[4238.02 → 4239.02] Right.
[4239.02 → 4241.02] We've gone beyond just our audience at this point.
[4241.02 → 4245.02] So that didn't really, I, sometimes it's hard for me to wrap my brain around that.
[4245.02 → 4246.02] That is a bit of a newer thing.
[4246.02 → 4247.02] Yeah.
[4247.02 → 4248.02] Yeah.
[4248.02 → 4251.02] Um, like, uh, Oh, this is, this is pretty wild.
[4251.02 → 4255.02] Uh, we have a big shipment of blank shirts coming cause, which is good because a lot of
[4255.02 → 4257.02] them are stock, um, including tall.
[4257.02 → 4262.02] And, uh, I think the tall is like, I think we pushed that one out of stock too.
[4262.02 → 4266.02] Our business team has apparently been getting a ton of inquiries from just like random people
[4266.02 → 4269.02] who work at random companies that are like, yeah, they want the blanks.
[4269.02 → 4273.02] Your blanks are like way better than like what all of our corporate apparel uses.
[4273.02 → 4274.02] Let's go.
[4274.02 → 4275.02] We have not found a better balance.
[4275.02 → 4277.02] Um, so like, do you guys do that?
[4277.02 → 4281.02] And we're like, no, but I mean, first time for everything.
[4281.02 → 4282.02] Yeah.
[4282.02 → 4284.02] It was a good, it was a good week or so.
[4284.02 → 4285.02] Lots more coming.
[4285.02 → 4286.02] Lots more coming.
[4286.02 → 4287.02] Three days.
[4287.02 → 4290.02] Are there going to be anything other than just black?
[4290.02 → 4293.02] Because I'm only going to have black shirts.
[4293.02 → 4294.02] I see that.
[4294.02 → 4296.02] I, uh, I tried one on the other week.
[4296.02 → 4298.02] I might've been, might've been yesterday.
[4298.02 → 4300.02] Oh, he's the day before coach potato.
[4300.02 → 4301.02] Yeah.
[4301.02 → 4302.02] They didn't give it to me.
[4302.02 → 4303.02] Oh, all right.
[4303.02 → 4304.02] Cause there aren't any in stock.
[4304.02 → 4308.02] Uh, different, there's a different colour of a t-shirt.
[4308.02 → 4309.02] Oh, that's cool.
[4309.02 → 4310.02] Okay.
[4310.02 → 4311.02] We're working on it.
[4311.02 → 4312.02] Okay.
[4312.02 → 4313.02] I'm stoked.
[4313.02 → 4315.02] Anyway, the point is you can also pick up a scribe driver.
[4315.02 → 4317.02] Um, spoiler precision.
[4317.02 → 4321.02] The 50 bit is one of the ones that is almost guaranteed to go up in price.
[4321.02 → 4325.02] If the tariffs do get implemented the way that we currently anticipate that they will.
[4325.02 → 4329.02] Um, so now would be a perfect time to pick up a precision.
[4329.02 → 4332.02] Um, anyway, where was I going with that?
[4332.02 → 4333.02] Right.
[4333.02 → 4338.02] So if you want to send a merch message, all you got to do is add some items to your cart
[4338.02 → 4341.02] and you will see the merch message box.
[4341.02 → 4346.02] You go ahead and leave a message, and it will go to producer Dan who will, um, respond to
[4346.02 → 4351.02] it or curate it for me and Luke, by the way, when you're in the cart, don't forget the bonus
[4351.02 → 4352.02] bin.
[4352.02 → 4354.02] You can get stickers.
[4354.02 → 4355.02] Cool.
[4355.02 → 4359.02] Uh, Dan, do you want to show us how merch messages work by reading out a couple of curated
[4359.02 → 4360.02] ones?
[4360.02 → 4361.02] Yeah, sure.
[4361.02 → 4364.02] I wasn't sure if you covered this at the top of the show, but I got this one very easily.
[4364.02 → 4365.02] Uh, Linus-
[4365.02 → 4367.02] The incoming's blowing up now.
[4367.02 → 4368.02] I know.
[4368.02 → 4373.02] Linus, uh, do you think NVIDIA will ever increase the stock of 5,000 series GPUs to meet demand?
[4373.02 → 4375.02] Or do we all just give up hope until the next series?
[4375.02 → 4379.02] So I don't know how much truth there is to this, but I read an article that someone wrote
[4379.02 → 4381.02] somewhere for some publication.
[4381.02 → 4383.02] I forget who it was, and I forget what site it was.
[4383.02 → 4388.02] So I don't know how credible it was, but what I read was that their Blackwell data centre
[4388.02 → 4391.02] GPUs have not been particularly well received.
[4391.02 → 4398.02] And some of their customers that had bought into Blackwell heavily before NVIDIA was shipping
[4398.02 → 4403.02] it has been disappointed by the power and cooling requirements and general bugginess and
[4403.02 → 4408.02] have actually been preferring to fall back to hopper based systems.
[4408.02 → 4415.02] What that would indicate to me, if true, and this was speculation, speculation from that
[4415.02 → 4416.02] article.
[4416.02 → 4418.02] So I'm not going to take credit for it.
[4418.02 → 4424.02] Um, but what that could mean is that NVIDIA might be incentivized to push some of their,
[4424.02 → 4431.02] their wafer bookings, um, for Blackwell to consumer GPUs rather than their more lucrative
[4431.02 → 4435.02] AI enterprise and data centre GPUs.
[4435.02 → 4436.02] Interesting.
[4436.02 → 4439.02] If that is the case, uh, and this was, this was weeks ago.
[4439.02 → 4446.02] So if that is the case, then sometime in the now a few weeks, uh, we could potentially see
[4446.02 → 4448.02] a dramatic loosening of supply for 50 series.
[4448.02 → 4453.02] And it does appear that it's kind of happening already, not in the U S so much again, just
[4453.02 → 4454.02] like with Intel arc.
[4454.02 → 4458.02] It seems like the U S is a little late to catch up, which I think they're not really used
[4458.02 → 4463.02] to like, I think other countries are like super used to, you know, an MSRP being announced
[4463.02 → 4468.02] and availability being announced and then being like, okay, well, I guess some months from
[4468.02 → 4471.02] now we'll get it for some dollars, get it for some amount of dollars.
[4471.02 → 4477.02] Um, but I think there's just so much pent-up GPU demand in the U S from just years of drought
[4477.02 → 4482.02] that it's just hoovering up anything that anyone can ship into it.
[4482.02 → 4488.02] So, um, so things are, do seem to be loosening up a little bit on 50 series, but I think there's
[4488.02 → 4494.02] a lot more work for Nvidia to do to help to stabilize pricing at somewhere near MSRP.
[4494.02 → 4499.02] And I, if, um, they are, they are not selling through as much of their, uh, their Blackwell
[4499.02 → 4503.02] data centre GPUs as they would hope I would, I would, it would certainly be in their best
[4503.02 → 4509.02] interest to use those wafers to make desktop GPUs rather than just, I don't know, try to renege
[4509.02 → 4510.02] on their contract or whatever.
[4510.02 → 4512.02] Like they're still selling desktop GPUs profitably.
[4512.02 → 4514.02] It's just not as profitable.
[4514.02 → 4515.02] Right.
[4515.02 → 4518.02] Now, how about some, uh, announcements?
[4518.02 → 4521.02] Oh, are we only doing one merch message?
[4521.02 → 4523.02] Well, we're doing a new method.
[4523.02 → 4525.02] We're doing a new method.
[4525.02 → 4527.02] Just read the, the CW.
[4527.02 → 4528.02] Just read the thing.
[4528.02 → 4529.02] Uh, okay.
[4529.02 → 4530.02] So just the CW.
[4530.02 → 4531.02] What does it go?
[4531.02 → 4532.02] F*** yourself, San Diego.
[4532.02 → 4534.02] Is that just, just read the thing?
[4534.02 → 4535.02] Read the line, Bart.
[4535.02 → 4536.02] Read the line.
[4536.02 → 4537.02] Coalinga.
[4537.02 → 4538.02] Sorry.
[4538.02 → 4539.02] I didn't do it.
[4539.02 → 4540.02] I think that's what it was.
[4540.02 → 4541.02] I think it's, I didn't do it.
[4541.02 → 4542.02] Okay.
[4542.02 → 4543.02] Sorry.
[4543.02 → 4544.02] What am I supposed to be reading?
[4544.02 → 4545.02] The just the CW one.
[4545.02 → 4546.02] Where is it?
[4546.02 → 4547.02] Just this one right here.
[4547.02 → 4548.02] And now a segue to this.
[4548.02 → 4549.02] Oh, but I just did that.
[4549.02 → 4550.02] Oh, okay.
[4550.02 → 4551.02] Did you?
[4551.02 → 4552.02] Uh, yeah, I think so.
[4552.02 → 4557.02] You have until Tuesday to get LTT store over 150 of the magnetic cable management.
[4557.02 → 4558.02] Yeah.
[4558.02 → 4559.02] I talked through it.
[4559.02 → 4562.02] And, uh, make sure that you use this opportunity to gear up.
[4562.02 → 4563.02] Yeah.
[4563.02 → 4564.02] I think you did do this.
[4564.02 → 4565.02] All right.
[4565.02 → 4566.02] Okay.
[4566.02 → 4567.02] Hi, Luke.
[4567.02 → 4568.02] Then it's two merge messages.
[4568.02 → 4569.02] Two merge messages.
[4569.02 → 4570.02] When did it become two?
[4570.02 → 4571.02] Well, wait, what's the float plane announcement?
[4571.02 → 4572.02] Well, it comes after a merchant.
[4572.02 → 4573.02] I didn't agree to any of this.
[4573.02 → 4574.02] I don't know what's happening.
[4574.02 → 4575.02] They changed on us.
[4575.02 → 4576.02] Oh, oh, there's a whole.
[4576.02 → 4577.02] It could be one merge message up here.
[4577.02 → 4578.02] Oh, I see.
[4578.02 → 4579.02] This could be one.
[4579.02 → 4580.02] We'll, we'll do two.
[4580.02 → 4582.02] But I thought we'd give people a longer break and do two.
[4582.02 → 4583.02] So there's a thing.
[4583.02 → 4584.02] There's like an agenda now.
[4584.02 → 4585.02] Yeah.
[4585.02 → 4587.02] So professional in a document and everything.
[4587.02 → 4589.02] There was before, but now it's different.
[4589.02 → 4590.02] Wow.
[4590.02 → 4592.02] None of us read it apparently for like a long time.
[4592.02 → 4593.02] I mean, yeah.
[4593.02 → 4594.02] Why would I?
[4594.02 → 4595.02] Exactly.
[4595.02 → 4596.02] That's what I said.
[4596.02 → 4601.02] Because I write them for me, and then I don't read them anymore because they're for my reference.
[4601.02 → 4603.02] It's like, man, we're all going to gloss over this during the show.
[4603.02 → 4604.02] Yeah.
[4604.02 → 4607.02] I thought it was just like a checklist for the preparation of the doc to like, make sure that
[4607.02 → 4609.02] we kind of knew what we're going to be talking about.
[4609.02 → 4611.02] I didn't think it was for the actual hosts.
[4611.02 → 4614.02] I told them that we will also never read it in the future.
[4614.02 → 4616.02] They just need to tell us when there's a change.
[4616.02 → 4617.02] Yeah.
[4617.02 → 4618.02] Yep.
[4618.02 → 4619.02] Tell me.
[4619.02 → 4621.02] And then I tell you, you guys don't even have to worry about it literally ever.
[4621.02 → 4622.02] Yeah.
[4622.02 → 4623.02] Let's do that.
[4623.02 → 4624.02] Sure.
[4624.02 → 4625.02] Yeah.
[4625.02 → 4626.02] Cause realistically Dan's going to be here.
[4626.02 → 4627.02] Cause if he wasn't here, he would end the streak and there's no way he's going to
[4627.02 → 4628.02] allow that to happen.
[4628.02 → 4629.02] Look at this guy.
[4629.02 → 4630.02] Look at this man.
[4630.02 → 4631.02] He's cold.
[4631.02 → 4632.02] He's calculating.
[4632.02 → 4633.02] He's cryptic.
[4633.02 → 4637.02] He's commanding.
[4638.02 → 4639.02] That one doesn't start with a K.
[4639.02 → 4640.02] Okay.
[4640.02 → 4645.02] Now we do another merch message.
[4645.02 → 4646.02] Cause now we're immediately out of order.
[4646.02 → 4647.02] It's all gone wrong.
[4647.02 → 4648.02] Yeah.
[4648.02 → 4650.02] Hit me Dan.
[4650.02 → 4651.02] Oh, world-class.
[4651.02 → 4652.02] Hi Luke.
[4652.02 → 4657.02] Do you often talk, you often talk about gaming or dopamine addiction and the harm it does.
[4657.02 → 4660.02] Have you read dopamine nation or anxious generation?
[4660.02 → 4663.02] Your hunches and references line up well with the research.
[4663.02 → 4664.02] Oh, wow.
[4665.02 → 4666.02] That's good to know.
[4666.02 → 4667.02] I haven't read either of them.
[4668.02 → 4671.02] I've heard of both of those, but I haven't read either of them.
[4672.02 → 4675.02] Um, but I'm happy that I'm not so far off.
[4675.02 → 4678.02] I, to be honest, I think it's pretty obvious.
[4678.02 → 4680.02] I suspect most people know.
[4680.02 → 4682.02] They just don't do anything about it.
[4682.02 → 4686.02] I suspect you overestimate the capacity of most people.
[4686.02 → 4687.02] All right.
[4687.02 → 4688.02] Fair enough.
[4688.02 → 4689.02] That might be true.
[4689.02 → 4690.02] George Carlin's famous bit.
[4690.02 → 4692.02] Think about the average person, you know, half of all people are dumber than that.
[4692.02 → 4693.02] Yeah.
[4693.02 → 4694.02] No, it's a little rough.
[4694.02 → 4703.02] And if you've, the fascinating research is how dramatically people overestimate where
[4703.02 → 4710.02] they fall on an IQ bell curve, how like dramatically over half of people will think that they are above
[4710.02 → 4717.02] 100 points when actually that is not possible because that's literally not how that scale works at all.
[4717.02 → 4719.02] It's pretty, it's pretty interesting.
[4719.02 → 4725.02] Well, the thing is you have to be, you have to be smart to know that you're not that smart.
[4725.02 → 4739.02] You know, something that's interesting to me, and this is not exactly in line with what you were saying, but something that's interesting to me is the like, if you're like, I'm in the 75th percentile for performance band at this thing.
[4739.02 → 4740.02] Mm-hmm.
[4740.02 → 4743.02] Compared to someone in the 99th percentile, you probably suck.
[4743.02 → 4744.02] You are an absolute scrum.
[4744.02 → 4745.02] Yeah.
[4745.02 → 4758.02] But someone who's in the like, 99.7 versus someone who's 99.0, the 99.0 person probably kind of sucks compared to the .7.
[4758.02 → 4759.02] Yeah.
[4759.02 → 4762.02] Like, the final little bit is insane.
[4762.02 → 4763.02] Yeah.
[4763.02 → 4764.02] Like, it's crazy.
[4764.02 → 4766.02] Like, how much better Connor McDaid is.
[4766.02 → 4767.02] Yeah.
[4767.02 → 4772.02] And even someone who is better than, you know, is a one in 100,000 hockey players.
[4772.02 → 4773.02] Yep.
[4773.02 → 4774.02] Like, it's...
[4774.02 → 4775.02] Not close.
[4775.02 → 4776.02] Yeah.
[4776.02 → 4778.02] Like, to the point where he could toy with them.
[4778.02 → 4779.02] Yeah.
[4779.02 → 4780.02] Like, it's wild, man.
[4780.02 → 4781.02] And does on a regular basis.
[4781.02 → 4782.02] Yeah.
[4782.02 → 4783.02] Best hockey player in the world.
[4783.02 → 4784.02] Yeah.
[4784.02 → 4785.02] Yeah, yeah.
[4785.02 → 4786.02] It's, yeah, anyway, it's...
[4786.02 → 4788.02] Scrappy DP says Vicki.
[4788.02 → 4789.02] Hear me out.
[4789.02 → 4790.02] Hear me out.
[4791.02 → 4792.02] Super Mario.
[4795.02 → 4797.02] More, more goals per game.
[4798.02 → 4801.02] Fighting back injury, literally recovering from cancer.
[4802.02 → 4804.02] Way more goals per playoff game.
[4804.02 → 4806.02] He played in the dead puck era.
[4807.02 → 4808.02] Super Mario.
[4808.02 → 4811.02] Way more dynamic player.
[4811.02 → 4812.02] Way more assists.
[4812.02 → 4813.02] Second only to Greek.
[4813.02 → 4816.02] Actually, my favourite, my favourite hockey player.
[4816.02 → 4817.02] Not even close.
[4817.02 → 4818.02] Pretty based.
[4818.02 → 4819.02] Not even close.
[4819.02 → 4820.02] Not even close.
[4820.02 → 4821.02] I like it.
[4821.02 → 4822.02] I like it.
[4822.02 → 4823.02] But yeah, I don't know.
[4823.02 → 4826.02] My line that I'll say again is you are constantly at war.
[4826.02 → 4831.02] You're at war with many, many, many billion-dollar companies that are fighting for your brain
[4831.02 → 4832.02] and they want you to suck.
[4832.02 → 4833.02] Yeah.
[4833.02 → 4834.02] And it's your job to not suck.
[4834.02 → 4840.02] Went from not playing for four years, literally sipping coolers, needing potato chips,
[4840.02 → 4846.02] to acquiring the franchise that he played for, put on his skates, put up numbers.
[4846.02 → 4849.02] I didn't know he owned the team while he played for it.
[4849.02 → 4850.02] Super Mario.
[4850.02 → 4851.02] That's sick.
[4851.02 → 4855.02] Literally came out of retirement to like to help the team that he had acquired.
[4855.02 → 4856.02] That's dope.
[4856.02 → 4859.02] The guy is actually an absolute Chad.
[4859.02 → 4860.02] That's pretty sweet.
[4860.02 → 4862.02] Also, I can never find the bloody clip of it.
[4862.02 → 4864.02] Is that the he got a background to be moving his couch, right?
[4864.02 → 4866.02] And then he went to the game like right after.
[4866.02 → 4867.02] Is that, is that right?
[4867.02 → 4868.02] I don't remember.
[4868.02 → 4869.02] I don't know that about him.
[4869.02 → 4870.02] It may be true.
[4870.02 → 4880.02] But the, there's a, there's the, there's this like 4,000 IQ clip of him where he doesn't
[4880.02 → 4882.02] actually score or get an assist.
[4882.02 → 4887.02] And I, I've, I've never been able to find it again, but it just about made my jaw hit
[4887.02 → 4888.02] my keyboard when I saw it.
[4888.02 → 4890.02] It's unfortunately not an NHL clip.
[4890.02 → 4894.02] So I've had a really hard time tracking out, tracking down where it was from.
[4894.02 → 4903.02] But basically he's, he's, he's rushing to the crease and his right-winger passes and Remix
[4903.02 → 4910.02] picks up his stick, looks at nothing, looks at nobody, picks up his stick so that the puck
[4910.02 → 4916.02] will go through him and his left-winger bangs it into a completely empty cage.
[4916.02 → 4925.02] Because he just had 4,000 IQ knew where absolutely everybody was on the ice and made that happen
[4925.02 → 4927.02] without even touching the puck.
[4927.02 → 4928.02] It's crazy.
[4928.02 → 4929.02] That's so sick.
[4929.02 → 4930.02] That's so sick.
[4930.02 → 4931.02] Also, Harry, you're wrong.
[4931.02 → 4934.02] The rest of the world cares plenty about hockey.
[4934.02 → 4935.02] They just don't know it yet.
[4935.02 → 4940.02] And to do that while knowing that you will get no credit.
[4940.02 → 4941.02] Oh yeah.
[4941.02 → 4942.02] Is so sick.
[4942.02 → 4943.02] Dude.
[4943.02 → 4944.02] So cool.
[4944.02 → 4945.02] That's dope.
[4945.02 → 4946.02] So cool.
[4946.02 → 4947.02] Yeah.
[4947.02 → 4950.02] If anyone, if anyone can remember and like find the clip I'm talking about, I would,
[4950.02 → 4953.02] I would be so, I would be so pleased.
[4953.02 → 4957.02] Someone in chat, I already lost it, but somebody in chat said we need a, I found it.
[4957.02 → 4959.02] Pathos said we need a good hockey anime.
[4959.02 → 4960.02] I totally agree.
[4960.02 → 4963.02] The closest thing we have to it is, uh, Shorty.
[4963.02 → 4964.02] There's a pair.
[4964.02 → 4965.02] Oh, okay.
[4965.02 → 4967.02] Well, Shorty is an anime.
[4967.02 → 4969.02] I need this.
[4969.02 → 4972.02] There's a pretty good badminton anime apparently, but I haven't watched it yet.
[4972.02 → 4974.02] I've been meaning to.
[4974.02 → 4975.02] Yeah.
[4975.02 → 4978.02] Never really gotten into anime, but apparently it's, uh, apparently it's pretty solid.
[4978.02 → 4979.02] Back when I was boxing all the time.
[4979.02 → 4982.02] My chat crashed right when I asked them to find a clip for me, Luke.
[4982.02 → 4983.02] They didn't.
[4983.02 → 4984.02] Dang it.
[4984.02 → 4985.02] Oh, they didn't find it?
[4985.02 → 4986.02] Someone just linked one.
[4986.02 → 4988.02] Oh, then mine's frozen too.
[4988.02 → 4989.02] And it's Rick Roll.
[4989.02 → 4992.02] These people are awful.
[4992.02 → 4993.02] Bamboozled.
[4993.02 → 4994.02] Well, you know you love them.
[4994.02 → 4995.02] Yeah.
[4995.02 → 4996.02] Oh.
[4998.02 → 4999.02] Was it the 2002 Olympics?
[4999.02 → 5003.02] This is a between the legs assist, which doesn't sound like what you described.
[5003.02 → 5004.02] Oh no, hold on.
[5004.02 → 5005.02] Maybe, yeah, maybe I had it wrong.
[5005.02 → 5006.02] Hold on.
[5006.02 → 5007.02] Can I, can I watch that?
[5007.02 → 5008.02] Okay.
[5008.02 → 5009.02] Hold on.
[5009.02 → 5010.02] This might be, this might be the one.
[5010.02 → 5011.02] Maybe he has the assist.
[5011.02 → 5012.02] Here, let's just, here, let's just, uh.
[5012.02 → 5015.02] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, definitely not that.
[5015.02 → 5016.02] Right.
[5016.02 → 5017.02] That makes sense.
[5017.02 → 5018.02] Hold on.
[5018.02 → 5019.02] Hold on.
[5019.02 → 5020.02] Hold on.
[5020.02 → 5021.02] Okay.
[5021.02 → 5022.02] Let me see it.
[5022.02 → 5023.02] Let me see it.
[5023.02 → 5024.02] Let me see it.
[5024.02 → 5025.02] Uh, this might not be it.
[5025.02 → 5026.02] Because it was like crappier, grainy footage.
[5026.02 → 5027.02] Hold on.
[5027.02 → 5029.02] Where's the slow version of this?
[5029.02 → 5031.02] Man, this game is too fast.
[5031.02 → 5032.02] Uh, okay.
[5032.02 → 5034.02] Blah, blah, blah, crowd reacts.
[5034.02 → 5035.02] Okay.
[5035.02 → 5037.02] Here's the here's the slow version.
[5037.02 → 5038.02] Hold on.
[5038.02 → 5039.02] Hold on.
[5039.02 → 5040.02] Hold on.
[5040.02 → 5041.02] Hold on.
[5041.02 → 5042.02] Hold on.
[5042.02 → 5043.02] No, that's not it.
[5043.02 → 5044.02] Yeah.
[5044.02 → 5046.02] It didn't seem like what you, it's good.
[5046.02 → 5047.02] That's not it.
[5047.02 → 5048.02] No, it's a this, this is great.
[5048.02 → 5049.02] Oh no, that is it.
[5049.02 → 5050.02] That is it.
[5050.02 → 5051.02] That is it.
[5051.02 → 5052.02] That is it.
[5052.02 → 5053.02] Okay.
[5053.02 → 5054.02] Okay.
[5054.02 → 5055.02] You know what?
[5055.02 → 5056.02] We're going to take a risk.
[5056.02 → 5057.02] We're going to take a risk.
[5057.02 → 5058.02] You can't see it unless you're at that angle.
[5058.02 → 5059.02] You're going to take a risk.
[5059.02 → 5060.02] This is, this is the this is it.
[5060.02 → 5061.02] This is the 4,000 IQ move.
[5061.02 → 5063.02] You have to have the right angle to see this.
[5063.02 → 5064.02] That's crazy.
[5064.02 → 5065.02] This is insane.
[5065.02 → 5066.02] Okay.
[5066.02 → 5067.02] So here we go.
[5067.02 → 5068.02] Here we go.
[5068.02 → 5069.02] Play as little of it as possible.
[5069.02 → 5070.02] Okay.
[5070.02 → 5071.02] Uh, yeah.
[5071.02 → 5072.02] We're going to play as little as possible.
[5072.02 → 5073.02] You got to show them where the puck is.
[5073.02 → 5074.02] Point it out.
[5074.02 → 5075.02] That's not just a random dot.
[5075.02 → 5076.02] Here's the puck.
[5076.02 → 5077.02] Yeah.
[5077.02 → 5078.02] Okay.
[5078.02 → 5079.02] Uh, hold on.
[5079.02 → 5080.02] Okay.
[5080.02 → 5081.02] So yeah, here we go.
[5081.02 → 5082.02] Here we go.
[5082.02 → 5083.02] This is the right-winger with the puck.
[5083.02 → 5086.02] Why does space not play on this website?
[5086.02 → 5088.02] Because you have the that's selected right now.
[5088.02 → 5089.02] Okay.
[5089.02 → 5090.02] All right.
[5090.02 → 5091.02] All right.
[5091.02 → 5092.02] All right.
[5092.02 → 5093.02] All right.
[5093.02 → 5094.02] All right.
[5094.02 → 5095.02] Okay.
[5095.02 → 5096.02] What?
[5096.02 → 5100.02] It looks, it looks so basic, but it's so sick.
[5100.02 → 5102.02] Are you kidding me right now?
[5102.02 → 5103.02] That's so sick.
[5103.02 → 5105.02] Are you kidding me?
[5105.02 → 5107.02] That's fantastic.
[5107.02 → 5108.02] That.
[5108.02 → 5113.02] No one, no one before.
[5113.02 → 5117.02] I love how you described it as like, you're not even wrong, but you're like, oh, it's
[5117.02 → 5118.02] not an NHL game.
[5118.02 → 5120.02] Like what are you're like downplaying the game?
[5120.02 → 5121.02] It was the Olympics.
[5121.02 → 5122.02] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5122.02 → 5123.02] It's not an NHL game.
[5123.02 → 5124.02] So it was hard for me to find it.
[5124.02 → 5125.02] Oh, okay.
[5125.02 → 5127.02] I couldn't, I couldn't even remember what tournament it was from.
[5127.02 → 5131.02] I thought you were trying to say like, it was just like a for fun, like random, who
[5131.02 → 5132.02] cares?
[5132.02 → 5135.02] Um, you didn't, but I thought that's what you meant.
[5135.02 → 5136.02] Yeah.
[5136.02 → 5139.02] No, this dude, that like, oh man, that was dude.
[5139.02 → 5142.02] That was, oh, that was, that's insane.
[5142.02 → 5143.02] That's insane.
[5143.02 → 5144.02] That's beautiful.
[5144.02 → 5145.02] Just like this.
[5145.02 → 5146.02] Did they give him the assist?
[5146.02 → 5147.02] I'm not sure.
[5147.02 → 5148.02] I'm not sure.
[5148.02 → 5150.02] He definitely assisted.
[5150.02 → 5151.02] He deserves it.
[5151.02 → 5152.02] Yeah.
[5152.02 → 5154.02] Lethal Bacon says, meh, it was an okay shot.
[5154.02 → 5155.02] He didn't take the shot.
[5155.02 → 5156.02] That's the point.
[5156.02 → 5157.02] Yeah.
[5157.02 → 5162.02] He is like, he is like pretended, doesn't even look up.
[5162.02 → 5165.02] Just, just pretends that he's doing it.
[5165.02 → 5167.02] So completely open cage.
[5167.02 → 5168.02] Love it.
[5168.02 → 5169.02] Absolutely love it.
[5169.02 → 5171.02] Um, and to be clear, there are a lot of modern players that are, I'm not sure.
[5171.02 → 5175.02] Modern players that are making moves that just blow the mind.
[5175.02 → 5180.02] I watched a clip the other day when the guy, what was going on?
[5180.02 → 5186.02] He had a defender on him, and he puts his stick out and blade goes flat against the ice.
[5186.02 → 5191.02] He makes a ramp and the puck comes up and ramps off his stick and goes over the defender's
[5191.02 → 5192.02] stick and goes to his teammate.
[5192.02 → 5196.02] He didn't like, it looks insane to watch.
[5196.02 → 5197.02] It's full speed.
[5197.02 → 5199.02] Everything just, and it just.
[5199.02 → 5201.02] He's like, we're so good these days.
[5201.02 → 5202.02] Oh.
[5202.02 → 5204.02] Super Mario was on a different level.
[5204.02 → 5207.02] Literally like, yeah.
[5207.02 → 5209.02] No, he's, he's, he's unbelievable.
[5209.02 → 5210.02] He is a thing of beauty.
[5210.02 → 5211.02] Based.
[5211.02 → 5212.02] Uh, okay.
[5212.02 → 5214.02] What, uh, what else we, what, what, what are we supposed to be doing right now?
[5214.02 → 5216.02] Now we're going to do a third merch message.
[5216.02 → 5217.02] A third merch message?
[5217.02 → 5218.02] Or we can just do two.
[5218.02 → 5221.02] No, I'm going to do three because we're minutes over time now.
[5221.02 → 5224.02] And it says it on the doc that I didn't write.
[5224.02 → 5226.02] Hello, Dynast Duke and Land.
[5226.02 → 5229.02] AWS technician here just coming up on one year.
[5229.02 → 5238.02] What is the junkiest, most inefficient, uh, process you've ever seen a, uh, tech industry giant have that is different from others?
[5238.02 → 5239.02] I think that's a process.
[5239.02 → 5241.02] It's a spelled wrong.
[5241.02 → 5242.02] Oh.
[5242.02 → 5244.02] Do we count as a tech industry giant?
[5244.02 → 5245.02] No, I don't think so.
[5245.02 → 5246.02] Okay.
[5246.02 → 5247.02] Not a giant, not in the tech industry.
[5247.02 → 5248.02] Oh.
[5248.02 → 5249.02] We're a media company.
[5249.02 → 5250.02] Mm.
[5250.02 → 5251.02] I'm hiding behind that shield today.
[5251.02 → 5253.02] You asked me a different day.
[5253.02 → 5255.02] I'm like, yeah, tech company float plane.
[5255.02 → 5256.02] Whatever's convenient.
[5256.02 → 5257.02] For once.
[5257.02 → 5258.02] That's how narcissists do it.
[5258.02 → 5261.02] I'm giving this to Linus.
[5261.02 → 5262.02] Oh, man.
[5262.02 → 5263.02] He's right.
[5263.02 → 5264.02] Yeah.
[5264.02 → 5266.02] No, we, we do.
[5266.02 → 5269.02] He owns tech companies.
[5269.02 → 5270.02] That's my old.
[5270.02 → 5271.02] Anyway, whatever.
[5271.02 → 5275.02] Ah, no, I'm very confident in this.
[5275.02 → 5276.02] Uh.
[5276.02 → 5278.02] These buttons are paying dividends.
[5278.02 → 5279.02] I know, man.
[5279.02 → 5281.02] Uh, okay.
[5281.02 → 5282.02] Okay.
[5282.02 → 5283.02] Okay.
[5283.02 → 5285.02] I'm going to count this one.
[5285.02 → 5287.02] I'm going to count this one, and I'm going to name them because I'm pretty sure they're
[5287.02 → 5291.02] going to name them because I'm pretty sure everyone who worked there when I worked on
[5291.02 → 5292.02] this is gone.
[5292.02 → 5295.02] So this says absolutely nothing about the company in its current form.
[5295.02 → 5296.02] This was like 10 years ago.
[5296.02 → 5297.02] Yeah.
[5297.02 → 5299.02] I don't even, that CEO isn't there anymore.
[5299.02 → 5300.02] Okay.
[5301.02 → 5308.02] When I did a sponsored project for Ford at the New York International Auto Show,
[5308.02 → 5310.02] um, this was, this was a cluster bomb.
[5310.02 → 5311.02] I don't think this is going to be controversial.
[5311.02 → 5314.02] So they contacted us during CES.
[5314.02 → 5315.02] Okay.
[5315.02 → 5316.02] Okay.
[5316.02 → 5318.02] And I don't know if you guys know this, but the New York International Auto Show, at least
[5318.02 → 5320.02] back then was right after CES.
[5320.02 → 5325.02] They were like, okay, we want to bring you guys out for our sponsored social posts.
[5325.02 → 5332.02] Um, and, uh, there's this round table discussion, and we're, um, and we're going to be, we're
[5332.02 → 5338.02] going to be the first to, uh, broadcast in three 60, um, on Facebook, which would have
[5338.02 → 5340.02] been a thing back then.
[5340.02 → 5346.02] And, um, we need you to do these Instagram posts, and you know, whatever.
[5346.02 → 5347.02] And I really didn't want to do it.
[5347.02 → 5353.02] I really didn't want to, because I was coming back from CES and CES is always a grind.
[5353.02 → 5356.02] And particularly back then it was a grind and a half.
[5356.02 → 5359.02] Um, the way that we would tackle that show with very few people.
[5359.02 → 5362.02] It was, it was, I don't know how we did it.
[5362.02 → 5367.02] Um, so anyway, I literally couldn't anymore the offer though.
[5367.02 → 5368.02] And we needed the money.
[5368.02 → 5369.02] We really needed the money at the time.
[5369.02 → 5372.02] And the offer was perfect.
[5372.02 → 5378.02] Um, so I agreed to fly back from Vegas to Vancouver on my original flight.
[5378.02 → 5384.02] And then literally I have a meal in the airport with my family and fly to New York, which I
[5384.02 → 5389.02] was not stoked to do, but you know, it was one of those things where the way that I would
[5389.02 → 5394.02] always do the math and even how I actually, I find myself falling into this math again,
[5394.02 → 5397.02] even though we have like proper reports and stuff, the way that I would do the math is
[5397.02 → 5402.02] I would take our average salaries and I would go, okay, how many, how many like employee
[5402.02 → 5404.02] hours would this pay?
[5404.02 → 5405.02] Right?
[5405.02 → 5406.02] Like that was just the way I would do the math.
[5406.02 → 5408.02] It's not an unreasonable way to think about that.
[5408.02 → 5409.02] Whether I would take a project, right?
[5409.02 → 5411.02] This runs the company for like three weeks.
[5411.02 → 5412.02] I have to take it.
[5412.02 → 5413.02] Yeah.
[5413.02 → 5414.02] I look at him.
[5414.02 → 5415.02] Yeah.
[5415.02 → 5416.02] Anyway, I'm not going to be clear.
[5416.02 → 5420.02] I don't know if there was anything, an ethical problem with it or whatever else, but it was
[5420.02 → 5423.02] just, it was like a couple of sponsored Instagram posts for Ford, who cares?
[5423.02 → 5424.02] Right?
[5424.02 → 5425.02] Like it didn't.
[5425.02 → 5426.02] Yeah.
[5426.02 → 5427.02] They weren't asking me to say anything that was untrue.
[5427.02 → 5429.02] It was so, so it wasn't a question of that.
[5429.02 → 5433.02] It was just a question of, okay, this is a perfectly okay project to take.
[5433.02 → 5434.02] Is it worth it?
[5434.02 → 5435.02] Yes.
[5435.02 → 5442.02] So I got there, and they're giving us kind of, they kind of set us loose in the showroom.
[5442.02 → 5447.02] It was a bunch of us and they kind of go, okay, here's this, like we had this special
[5447.02 → 5454.02] app that we had to use to create draft posts that their agency could then approve and then
[5454.02 → 5456.02] they would go up or something.
[5456.02 → 5459.02] So, so anyway, we were like going around, they have the show, we're on the show floor
[5459.02 → 5462.02] and they have their showroom with all of their, all of their vehicles.
[5462.02 → 5465.02] And they had a few key things that they wanted us to look at, you know, things like backup cameras
[5465.02 → 5467.02] and stuff that would have been features back then.
[5467.02 → 5472.02] And the reason that I'm counting this as a tech company is because Ford was in the midst
[5472.02 → 5477.02] of trying to rebrand themselves as a tech company, which I think they've kind of done.
[5477.02 → 5480.02] I mean, F-150 Lightning is a pretty techy car at this point, right?
[5480.02 → 5481.02] Fair enough.
[5481.02 → 5484.02] So, so that's why I'm calling Ford a tech company because they were calling themselves
[5484.02 → 5485.02] a tech company.
[5485.02 → 5486.02] And that was a big part of the push.
[5486.02 → 5490.02] And it was a big part of the reason that I was there rather than traditional automotive influencers
[5490.02 → 5491.02] or whatever else.
[5491.02 → 5492.02] Right.
[5492.02 → 5497.02] So anyway, I'm on the show floor, and I'm like, okay, so I'm done my Instagram posts.
[5497.02 → 5499.02] This doesn't seem like work.
[5499.02 → 5502.02] Um, no offence to like Instagram influences or whatever.
[5502.02 → 5506.02] Like that's some of them put like a ton of work into the staging and framing and whatever.
[5506.02 → 5508.02] But realistically Ford didn't care.
[5508.02 → 5509.02] And I didn't care.
[5509.02 → 5511.02] We had like almost no followers on Instagram.
[5511.02 → 5515.02] So I go to the I go to the rep, and I'm just like, I'm done.
[5515.02 → 5518.02] Like, do you want to do YouTube video or something?
[5518.02 → 5524.02] Um, and they're basically like, no, the KPI is Instagram posts.
[5524.02 → 5526.02] I'm like, cause like, I'll do it.
[5526.02 → 5527.02] Like, this is pretty cool.
[5527.02 → 5529.02] Like I actually, I like the products.
[5529.02 → 5530.02] I think they're cool.
[5530.02 → 5533.02] Like, do you, like, should I, should I do that now?
[5533.02 → 5534.02] They're like, no.
[5534.02 → 5539.02] And I'm like, but I don't even, I don't even have a lot of, I don't even have a lot
[5539.02 → 5540.02] of followers on Instagram.
[5540.02 → 5542.02] Like I, like I'm way bigger on YouTube.
[5542.02 → 5545.02] Do you want me to, but that's how rigid.
[5545.02 → 5546.02] Rigid.
[5546.02 → 5547.02] Icky.
[5547.02 → 5552.02] The processes can be, um, and it's, I don't know about icky, but it's incompetent.
[5552.02 → 5553.02] I just, I don't.
[5557.02 → 5559.02] I detest that like type of work.
[5559.02 → 5560.02] Sure.
[5560.02 → 5561.02] I hate it.
[5561.02 → 5563.02] Where you're not giving any thought.
[5563.02 → 5564.02] Yeah.
[5564.02 → 5566.02] But realistically, they're not in a position where they can give thought.
[5566.02 → 5569.02] But then I would, I would not function.
[5569.02 → 5571.02] Oh, I see what you're saying is a personal thing.
[5571.02 → 5572.02] Yeah.
[5572.02 → 5573.02] I get it.
[5573.02 → 5576.02] I'm not even necessarily blaming them.
[5576.02 → 5578.02] Like, it just, I don't know.
[5578.02 → 5580.02] What I think happened was someone bailed.
[5580.02 → 5583.02] And I think that it was someone with more Instagram following.
[5583.02 → 5585.02] And at the end of the day, they just have their KPI.
[5585.02 → 5589.02] And their KPI is they need a certain amount of like Instagram likes, and they have a certain
[5589.02 → 5590.02] budget.
[5590.02 → 5593.02] So they go out, and they get a stable of influencers that get them over their limit.
[5593.02 → 5596.02] They need to have a certain number of people there for the round table discussion.
[5596.02 → 5599.02] They just have the parameters, and they're working with their parameters.
[5599.02 → 5600.02] And a YouTube video.
[5600.02 → 5602.02] It doesn't help them at all.
[5602.02 → 5603.02] Not their parameters.
[5603.02 → 5605.02] So they don't care.
[5605.02 → 5609.02] But the reason why that feels icky is that you don't feel like you're on part of a team.
[5609.02 → 5611.02] Because it's not part of the parameters.
[5611.02 → 5613.02] It doesn't help them at all.
[5613.02 → 5615.02] It doesn't help their team at all.
[5615.02 → 5617.02] Even though that would help the organization.
[5617.02 → 5621.02] It would help your people as a whole.
[5621.02 → 5624.02] But at that scale, I think this just happens.
[5624.02 → 5625.02] It just happens.
[5625.02 → 5626.02] Where that's irrelevant now.
[5626.02 → 5627.02] Yep.
[5627.02 → 5628.02] And I just don't like that.
[5628.02 → 5630.02] KPI stands for key performance indicator.
[5630.02 → 5636.02] So basically the proof of performance that you like did your job.
[5636.02 → 5641.02] So like if you're a sales representative, your main KPI is going to be selling lots of stuff.
[5641.02 → 5646.02] Or if you're a customer care, your KPI would be customer satisfaction surveys.
[5646.02 → 5653.02] Think about when we started putting Flow plane exclusives on to YouTube for YouTube members.
[5653.02 → 5658.02] People came to me with that like tiptoeing super hard.
[5658.02 → 5660.02] Because they expected me to be pissed.
[5660.02 → 5665.02] And my response was like, this seems like the right move for the company overhaul.
[5665.02 → 5666.02] Good job.
[5666.02 → 5668.02] But that is a big...
[5668.02 → 5669.02] It's not...
[5669.02 → 5671.02] It shouldn't be protectionism.
[5671.02 → 5672.02] You what?
[5672.02 → 5673.02] Yeah.
[5673.02 → 5674.02] I mean the experience is still better on Flow plane.
[5674.02 → 5675.02] You still get more stuff on Flow plane.
[5675.02 → 5678.02] We're talking to Flow plane chat right now.
[5678.02 → 5679.02] It's better.
[5679.02 → 5680.02] Yeah.
[5680.02 → 5681.02] But it's not...
[5681.02 → 5686.02] Some people will never do any engagement with us whatsoever off of YouTube.
[5686.02 → 5687.02] That is a fact.
[5687.02 → 5688.02] Yeah.
[5688.02 → 5689.02] Their payment information is already there.
[5689.02 → 5691.02] And it's more convenient for them to just click a button.
[5691.02 → 5693.02] It's a worse experience.
[5693.02 → 5694.02] They don't get as much.
[5694.02 → 5695.02] But they get something.
[5695.02 → 5697.02] And if that something is worth it to them for those dollars...
[5697.02 → 5699.02] We will take those dollars.
[5699.02 → 5700.02] Sure.
[5700.02 → 5701.02] Sounds good.
[5701.02 → 5702.02] And we will give them something in return.
[5702.02 → 5706.02] But that perspective is a big part of why you were probably always destined for some
[5706.02 → 5708.02] kind of management.
[5708.02 → 5712.02] And some people don't see that perspective.
[5712.02 → 5716.02] And sometimes it's not even their own fault because they can...
[5716.02 → 5723.02] I think people can end up really disenfranchised when their leadership doesn't see the bigger picture like you describe.
[5723.02 → 5733.02] Like I think that you could start with an idealistic view that anything you do that helps the company should ultimately be, you know, received positively and rewarded.
[5733.02 → 5734.02] But if you get like...
[5734.02 → 5737.02] If you get it beaten out of you enough times...
[5737.02 → 5739.02] Like let's say I was that sales rep.
[5739.02 → 5740.02] Yeah.
[5740.02 → 5741.02] I think this happens a lot.
[5741.02 → 5744.02] Let's say I was that sales rep, and I'm only incentivized by like selling things.
[5744.02 → 5750.02] But I would spend probably a solid half an hour of my day every day making sure that I tidied up the front desk.
[5750.02 → 5753.02] Because no one else was doing it.
[5753.02 → 5755.02] And I'm still like mostly hitting my quota.
[5755.02 → 5760.02] But then I have someone yelling at me because I'm such a good salesperson, and I'm not just talking to customers.
[5760.02 → 5762.02] Then I might stop doing it.
[5762.02 → 5763.02] Right?
[5763.02 → 5764.02] And I think that...
[5764.02 → 5765.02] I think that...
[5765.02 → 5767.02] Sometimes that might be okay, but it's often not.
[5767.02 → 5770.02] Like think about if that sales rep did do the YouTube video with you.
[5770.02 → 5772.02] It gets a million views.
[5772.02 → 5776.02] But your 50,000 like Instagram post didn't go up.
[5776.02 → 5777.02] I have no idea how many likes we get on Instagram.
[5777.02 → 5778.02] Very few.
[5778.02 → 5779.02] We have a pretty small following on Instagram.
[5779.02 → 5781.02] 5,000 like Instagram posts.
[5781.02 → 5782.02] Not even.
[5782.02 → 5783.02] Sure, yeah.
[5783.02 → 5784.02] 2,000...
[5784.02 → 5785.02] Thanks.
[5785.02 → 5786.02] 1,000...
[5786.02 → 5787.02] I have no idea anymore.
[5787.02 → 5790.02] 45 like Instagram posts doesn't go up for some reason.
[5790.02 → 5794.02] And he misses his quota by your post amount.
[5794.02 → 5795.02] Yeah.
[5795.02 → 5797.02] But your YouTube video got a million views.
[5797.02 → 5800.02] To me, huge win.
[5800.02 → 5801.02] I know.
[5801.02 → 5802.02] Whatever.
[5802.02 → 5803.02] I know.
[5803.02 → 5808.02] But maybe he loses out on some personal income or whatever else for that reason.
[5808.02 → 5811.02] Like that can really bash people down.
[5811.02 → 5816.02] You have a minuscule ego compared to most of the executives and project managers I've seen.
[5816.02 → 5817.02] And he tagged me.
[5817.02 → 5819.02] I don't know if that's true.
[5819.02 → 5821.02] Luke definitely has an ego.
[5821.02 → 5823.02] I can't...
[5823.02 → 5824.02] I can't...
[5824.02 → 5827.02] You actually nailed it by the way.
[5827.02 → 5828.02] What?
[5828.02 → 5829.02] I think your first guess was 5,000 likes.
[5829.02 → 5830.02] No, I think I said 50.
[5830.02 → 5831.02] Oh, did you?
[5831.02 → 5832.02] I corrected down to 5,000.
[5832.02 → 5833.02] Okay.
[5833.02 → 5835.02] Well, this was the 360-degree camera setup.
[5835.02 → 5836.02] Yeah.
[5836.02 → 5837.02] I think...
[5837.02 → 5838.02] Yeah, yeah.
[5838.02 → 5841.02] This one was part of the sponsored thing.
[5841.02 → 5845.02] Look at all these like ads and hashtags.
[5845.02 → 5846.02] Blah, blah, blah.
[5846.02 → 5848.02] Fun fact, by the way.
[5848.02 → 5852.02] The round table discussion did go ahead according to plan.
[5852.02 → 5854.02] But they never published it.
[5854.02 → 5855.02] I think...
[5855.02 → 5856.02] Yeah.
[5856.02 → 5859.02] I would imagine it didn't make it past legal or something.
[5859.02 → 5862.02] And the scuttlebutt that I heard was that...
[5862.02 → 5863.02] What's the American...
[5863.02 → 5864.02] No.
[5864.02 → 5868.02] Ryan Sea crest actually co-hosted the panel.
[5868.02 → 5874.02] And the scuttlebutt that I heard was that that was a 100s of thousands of dollars bill
[5874.02 → 5877.02] for a piece of content that was never published.
[5877.02 → 5881.02] Not to mention, so hundreds of thousands of dollars for Ryan Sea crest alone,
[5881.02 → 5886.02] who was only there for part, like the first half, along with Ford's CEO at the time.
[5886.02 → 5890.02] And then their like VP of technology or whatever stepped in for both of them.
[5890.02 → 5891.02] And it continued in the second half.
[5891.02 → 5898.02] And I overheard someone saying that Sea crest was literally already in the shuttle back to his private plane
[5898.02 → 5901.02] by the time we were done wrapping.
[5901.02 → 5903.02] The second part.
[5903.02 → 5905.02] That's wild.
[5905.02 → 5910.02] And that was on top of all the cost of having literally the entire rest of the table of influencers sitting there.
[5910.02 → 5914.02] So I think basically I'm not even trying to pick on Ford.
[5914.02 → 5916.02] And I'm certainly not trying to pick on any individual person.
[5916.02 → 5921.02] Like I said, none of the people that I interacted with, there's any way that they're still at Ford at this point.
[5921.02 → 5924.02] This is 483 weeks ago.
[5924.02 → 5926.02] This was in 2016.
[5926.02 → 5928.02] So nine years ago.
[5928.02 → 5930.02] Nine plus years ago.
[5930.02 → 5945.02] But I think that what I was the point I was trying to make is that processes can get extremely KPI focused and very focused on the trees when the forest is much more important.
[5945.02 → 5949.02] And I think that that's something that can happen at just about any large company.
[5949.02 → 5950.02] Yeah.
[5950.02 → 5958.02] And the reason I'm telling this story is mostly to illustrate that this kind of thing happens all the time.
[5958.02 → 5959.02] Super common.
[5959.02 → 5971.02] And that is a big part of my perspective in general where you'll see other tech media go malice, malice, malice, scamming, taking advantage of the customer.
[5971.02 → 5978.02] But from what I've experienced, the probably like perverse incentives or whatever else.
[5978.02 → 5996.02] Far more likely explanation is incompetence because there is no way that them refusing a free YouTube video from a YouTuber instead of some crappy Instagram posts from a not Instagrammer had anything to do with anything other than incompetence.
[5996.02 → 5999.02] And that's just that's just the truth.
[5999.02 → 6002.02] That's just the way it is.
[6002.02 → 6004.02] To address the ego comics.
[6004.02 → 6005.02] I've been trying to think here.
[6005.02 → 6006.02] I'm like really surprised.
[6006.02 → 6007.02] Wow, you're really.
[6007.02 → 6008.02] Wow, you're really.
[6008.02 → 6012.02] But I think I what kind of ego would you have to read that comment?
[6012.02 → 6017.02] You want to say it out loud and still be thinking about it when I'm saying things that are so much more interesting.
[6017.02 → 6026.02] I tend to I tend to align really well with team effort.
[6026.02 → 6028.02] Yes, I tend to live really well with team effort.
[6028.02 → 6032.02] I also think I'm I'm rarely like the best at something when we start.
[6032.02 → 6038.02] I'm rarely the smartest person in the room, but I will out try hard like anyone.
[6038.02 → 6043.02] Anyone that has always been my thing forever.
[6043.02 → 6046.02] I will sweat so hard and I will eventually win.
[6046.02 → 6059.02] My mom had a term for the kids in her class that were not that not the brightest intellects, but we're perfect at school.
[6059.02 → 6065.02] She called them a getters because they got a's, but they brute forced it.
[6065.02 → 6066.02] You are not an getter.
[6066.02 → 6070.02] No, you are actually someone who effortlessly got a's in school.
[6070.02 → 6076.02] Yeah, but you're you're one of those people who is very, very smart.
[6076.02 → 6081.02] But like I was talking about earlier smart enough to know that you're not the smartest guy in the room.
[6081.02 → 6084.02] Yeah, like that's the thing right.
[6084.02 → 6091.02] And like Luke was talking about with the like the percentile differences, Luke could be 99th percentile.
[6091.02 → 6094.02] He could be smarter than literally 90 99 out of 100 people.
[6094.02 → 6106.02] But then I hang out with but the insert name the 99.5% and the 99.9% who basically are to him what he is to someone who gets.
[6106.02 → 6113.02] Passed over for every promotion, you know, and that's just the truth.
[6113.02 → 6114.02] That's just the truth.
[6114.02 → 6116.02] Of course, there's more to life than just being smart.
[6116.02 → 6121.02] Like a big part of success is learning to work with people communication skills.
[6121.02 → 6128.02] The amount of wasted potential personable who are smart, but have no grit or will put no effort into anything is insane.
[6128.02 → 6131.02] Yeah, I yeah, I don't know.
[6131.02 → 6132.02] I don't know.
[6134.02 → 6136.02] Scrappy DP says Luke not 99.9%.
[6136.02 → 6137.02] We know.
[6137.02 → 6138.02] We know.
[6138.02 → 6143.02] Oh, and actually they had matter says you can't be over 99 percentiles.
[6143.02 → 6146.02] That is actually I don't think that is quite true.
[6146.02 → 6149.02] I think depending on what we're measuring, you can be over 99 percentiles.
[6149.02 → 6152.02] But in terms of intellect, I don't think they rated over 99.
[6152.02 → 6153.02] I have no idea for intelligence.
[6153.02 → 6156.02] We're talking about a theoretical like a hypothetical.
[6156.02 → 6166.02] If there was the point is just that as you approach that asymptote, it goes out really, really, really far within that 1% that we don't even really have a way of accurately quantifying.
[6166.02 → 6167.02] Yeah.
[6167.02 → 6172.02] And that even assumes that the IQ scale is accurate, which we know for a fact that it isn't.
[6172.02 → 6180.02] It's just kind of from my understanding, the closest measure that we have of objective analysis of intellectual prowess.
[6180.02 → 6186.02] The ability to like to apply your IQ potential to something is like super important.
[6186.02 → 6195.02] A lot of people just like can't do it due to, I don't know, ability to work as a team, social skills in general, different things like that.
[6195.02 → 6200.02] People can often struggle as humans or social creatures.
[6200.02 → 6203.02] You kind of have to accomplish things together generally.
[6203.02 → 6206.02] So I think people get held back from that sometimes.
[6206.02 → 6208.02] Okay.
[6208.02 → 6210.02] Oh, actually, this is hilarious.
[6210.02 → 6214.02] This is not really a great analogy, but it tickled me anyway.
[6214.02 → 6223.02] Willing Spy in Float plane Chat says it's kind of like how going from level 98 to 99 in Diablo 2 is the same amount of XP as level 1 to level 92.
[6223.02 → 6224.02] Kind of though.
[6224.02 → 6227.02] There's a RuneScape version of that too.
[6227.02 → 6229.02] 98 is half of 99 or something like that.
[6229.02 → 6230.02] Don't quote me.
[6230.02 → 6232.02] I haven't played 2007 Scape in a long time.
[6232.02 → 6233.02] It's actually wild though.
[6233.02 → 6235.02] Like, I don't know.
[6235.02 → 6238.02] 92 is half of 99.
[6238.02 → 6240.02] Maybe if he had more IQ.
[6240.02 → 6241.02] 92.
[6241.02 → 6242.02] It's true.
[6242.02 → 6243.02] It's true.
[6243.02 → 6245.02] I had to look it up.
[6245.02 → 6246.02] Alright.
[6246.02 → 6247.02] No skill waste.
[6247.02 → 6248.02] What are we doing?
[6248.02 → 6249.02] Now you're going to read the Float plane announcement.
[6249.02 → 6251.02] Oh, okay.
[6251.02 → 6252.02] Uh-huh.
[6252.02 → 6253.02] Yes, sir.
[6253.02 → 6254.02] Yes, sir.
[6254.02 → 6255.02] Right away, sir.
[6255.02 → 6258.02] I've always said, who the f*** is Daniel Lesser?
[6258.02 → 6262.02] But I've never asked what the f*** does Daniel Lesser do?
[6262.02 → 6273.02] The answer, to answer one of the two questions, we caught up with Dan in a new series, Dan's Dailies, where he shares some of his day-to-day activities.
[6273.02 → 6278.02] Um, the current like-dislike ratio on this is infinity.
[6278.02 → 6279.02] Um, people...
[6279.02 → 6283.02] Although, I think it's already on hiatus.
[6283.02 → 6285.02] Dan's Dailies is already on hiatus.
[6285.02 → 6288.02] Oh yeah, it like had to get cancelled halfway through.
[6288.02 → 6289.02] Oh, okay.
[6289.02 → 6292.02] Because I stopped doing different things.
[6292.02 → 6293.02] Yeah.
[6293.02 → 6294.02] Oh, right.
[6294.02 → 6296.02] And it got really, really, really boring.
[6296.02 → 6297.02] Okay, cool.
[6297.02 → 6298.02] Yeah.
[6298.02 → 6299.02] Oh yeah, okay.
[6299.02 → 6300.02] Well anyway, people really love this video.
[6300.02 → 6301.02] Sorry guys.
[6301.02 → 6303.02] So you can go watch this video.
[6303.02 → 6306.02] Also, where did we get this Float plane mic flag?
[6306.02 → 6307.02] Because I love it.
[6307.02 → 6308.02] It's a 3D printed, actually.
[6308.02 → 6309.02] I love it so much.
[6309.02 → 6310.02] Yeah, same as 710 for a while.
[6310.02 → 6314.02] Do you remember how much we paid for a stupid mic flag back our first trade show?
[6314.02 → 6318.02] No, but I remember it was like enough that we talked about it a lot.
[6318.02 → 6320.02] Unreasonably expensive.
[6320.02 → 6321.02] And then because it cost...
[6321.02 → 6322.02] Preprinting is cool.
[6322.02 → 6326.02] It cost so much to like to get it personalized.
[6326.02 → 6330.02] I just like used a, uh, I used my printer at home.
[6330.02 → 6331.02] And then I used packing tape.
[6331.02 → 6332.02] Yeah.
[6332.02 → 6335.02] Around it to like to try to make a branded flag.
[6335.02 → 6337.02] In fact, oh man, now I have to go find this.
[6337.02 → 6338.02] I'm sure there's...
[6338.02 → 6340.02] Oh dude, I'm going to find footage of it.
[6340.02 → 6341.02] Uh, YouTube.
[6341.02 → 6342.02] Hold on.
[6342.02 → 6343.02] I will show you guys.
[6343.02 → 6344.02] I will show you guys.
[6344.02 → 6345.02] I will show you guys.
[6345.02 → 6346.02] I will show you guys.
[6346.02 → 6347.02] The Creator Warehouse team made it for Sammy maybe?
[6347.02 → 6348.02] Tynan said we made it for Sammy.
[6348.02 → 6349.02] That's super cool.
[6349.02 → 6350.02] Uh, let's see.
[6350.02 → 6351.02] Was it CES?
[6351.02 → 6352.02] I don't think it was CES.
[6352.02 → 6353.02] The suit era!
[6353.02 → 6354.02] I don't think I had a might...
[6354.02 → 6355.02] Well, not suit even.
[6355.02 → 6356.02] Not suits, but we're dressed up.
[6356.02 → 6359.02] But I'm sure you can tell how many videos I shot in a single day.
[6359.02 → 6361.02] Because I'm wearing the same shirt in this one.
[6361.02 → 6362.02] This one.
[6362.02 → 6363.02] This one.
[6363.02 → 6364.02] Absolutely wild.
[6364.02 → 6365.02] Very likely more.
[6365.02 → 6366.02] There you go.
[6366.02 → 6367.02] And this one.
[6367.02 → 6368.02] Yeah.
[6368.02 → 6369.02] Man, those days were wild.
[6369.02 → 6370.02] Uh, okay.
[6370.02 → 6371.02] Was it Computer?
[6371.02 → 6375.02] I think it might have been Computer because we did the sponsorship with WD.
[6375.02 → 6376.02] Look at this guy.
[6376.02 → 6377.02] Hell yeah, dude.
[6377.02 → 6378.02] Look at this guy.
[6378.02 → 6379.02] Hell yeah.
[6379.02 → 6380.02] Absolute Chad.
[6380.02 → 6382.02] Um, no.
[6382.02 → 6384.02] I didn't have a mic flag yet.
[6384.02 → 6385.02] Aw man, remember when Ed did this cool?
[6385.02 → 6386.02] Because we were like travelling.
[6386.02 → 6387.02] We took a plane there.
[6387.02 → 6388.02] Mmm, we took a plane there.
[6388.02 → 6389.02] You're just so cool.
[6389.02 → 6390.02] Uh, okay.
[6390.02 → 6391.02] I'm going to keep trying to find this.
[6391.02 → 6392.02] In the meantime, you want to find another topic for us?
[6392.02 → 6393.02] Sure.
[6393.02 → 6394.02] Oh wait, did I finish reading the thing?
[6394.02 → 6395.02] No, I didn't finish reading the thing.
[6395.02 → 6396.02] Do you wanna...
[6396.02 → 6397.02] I can finish it off while you look.
[6397.02 → 6398.02] Sure, thanks.
[6398.02 → 6399.02] Uh, so yeah, like ratio perfect.
[6399.02 → 6400.02] There's also a small...
[6400.02 → 6401.02] That's a weird invitation, but okay.
[6401.02 → 6402.02] Uh, there's also a small discussion on Airtable.
[6402.02 → 6403.02] A whole new system Dan is building.
[6403.02 → 6404.02] Uh, yeah.
[6404.02 → 6405.02] That's a weird invitation, but okay.
[6405.02 → 6407.02] Uh, there's also a small discussion on Airtable.
[6407.02 → 6408.02] A whole new system Dan is building, uh, yeah.
[6408.02 → 6409.02] Uh, is building with the help of Nicole.
[6409.02 → 6410.02] Airtable isn't the system that he's building.
[6410.02 → 6411.02] He's building a system on top of Airtable.
[6411.02 → 6412.02] Airtable is a software product, but anyway.
[6412.02 → 6413.02] How do you build something on top of an Airtable?
[6413.02 → 6414.02] I am such an f***ING a**hole.
[6414.02 → 6415.02] Also, season two of Why is Wan late?
[6415.02 → 6416.02] Is now out, and Linus is somehow a winning?
[6416.02 → 6417.02] Question mark, question mark, question mark.
[6417.02 → 6418.02] Is he cheating?
[6418.02 → 6419.02] Never.
[6419.02 → 6420.02] Yes.
[6420.02 → 6421.02] Is Luke just...
[6421.02 → 6422.02] Is Luke just...
[6422.02 → 6423.02] Yeah, it's a big deal.
[6423.02 → 6424.02] Uh, the thing that I'm saying, is that he's doing...
[6424.02 → 6425.02] Is that the thing that he's doing?
[6425.02 → 6426.02] I am the help of Nicole?
[6426.02 → 6427.02] Uh, Airtable isn't the system that he's building.
[6427.02 → 6428.02] He's building a system on top of Airtable.
[6428.02 → 6429.02] Airtable is a software product.
[6429.02 → 6430.02] But anyway.
[6430.02 → 6431.02] I need to build something on top of an Airtable.
[6431.02 → 6432.02] How do you build something on top of an Airtable?
[6432.02 → 6433.02] I am such an f***ING a**hole.
[6433.02 → 6436.02] Also, season two of Why is Wan late?
[6436.02 → 6438.02] Is now out, and Linus is somehow a winning?
[6438.02 → 6439.02] Question mark, question mark.
[6439.02 → 6441.02] Is he cheating?
[6441.02 → 6442.02] Never.
[6442.02 → 6443.02] Yes.
[6443.02 → 6444.02] Never.
[6444.02 → 6445.02] Is Luke just slacking off?
[6445.02 → 6446.02] No.
[6446.02 → 6447.02] And breaking the law?
[6447.02 → 6448.02] Yes.
[6448.02 → 6450.02] What's more of a cheat?
[6450.02 → 6453.02] Bending the rules, or literally breaking the law?
[6453.02 → 6456.02] It wasn't breaking the law of the competition though.
[6456.02 → 6458.02] It was just breaking the law...
[6458.02 → 6459.02] Of the country.
[6459.02 → 6461.02] Which is less important.
[6461.02 → 6462.02] Objectively.
[6462.02 → 6465.02] Federal crimes are less important than when, Joe?
[6465.02 → 6469.02] Federal crimes basically don't matter.
[6469.02 → 6471.02] I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[6471.02 → 6472.02] Uh, if you...
[6472.02 → 6474.02] How do you tell that you're a C executive?
[6474.02 → 6475.02] Yeah, C-suite.
[6475.02 → 6480.02] Classic.
[6480.02 → 6487.02] Some of you may die, but at least I was not late.
[6487.02 → 6490.02] That is a risk I am willing to take.
[6490.02 → 6501.02] Uh, if you love the processes or want to see if Linus is a snaky, cheating, stinking, cheating cheater...
[6501.02 → 6503.02] That's, there's no way that's in the doc.
[6503.02 → 6504.02] That literally, that says there's...
[6504.02 → 6505.02] It's word for word.
[6505.02 → 6508.02] Snaky, cheat, stinking, cheating cheater.
[6508.02 → 6509.02] Wow.
[6509.02 → 6511.02] I feel personally attacked right now.
[6511.02 → 6512.02] Check out...
[6512.02 → 6514.02] Because I'm being personally attacked right now!
[6514.02 → 6515.02] That's true.
[6515.02 → 6517.02] Uh, just like an executive.
[6517.02 → 6520.02] Check out, uh, leg.GG slash float plane or...
[6520.02 → 6521.02] Yes.
[6521.02 → 6526.02] Or, YouTube members plus for the lazy.
[6526.02 → 6530.02] You can't call our supporters lazy, you guys.
[6530.02 → 6532.02] That's also in the doc!
[6532.02 → 6534.02] I have to, I have to read.
[6534.02 → 6536.02] You can't call our supporters lazy!
[6536.02 → 6539.02] It's, it's in the doc, I have to do it.
[6539.02 → 6540.02] Okay, well I found it.
[6540.02 → 6543.02] Uh, we gave you one of those zoom mics because...
[6543.02 → 6544.02] Oh dude!
[6544.02 → 6545.02] I'm actually suited up.
[6545.02 → 6546.02] Dude, look at him so dapper.
[6546.02 → 6547.02] Wow!
[6547.02 → 6549.02] And then this is, this is me.
[6550.02 → 6551.02] So...
[6551.02 → 6554.02] You have to support the channel!
[6554.02 → 6555.02] Okay...
[6557.02 → 6558.02] There you go.
[6558.02 → 6560.02] Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
[6560.02 → 6561.02] So this...
[6561.02 → 6562.02] Oh my God!
[6562.02 → 6563.02] It's taped on!
[6563.02 → 6564.02] This is packing tape!
[6564.02 → 6566.02] We've come a long way!
[6566.02 → 6568.02] It's just really, really, really glossy paint.
[6568.02 → 6576.00] have um so if we look closely there you go you can really see so it wasn't quite the same width
[6576.00 → 6583.40] so I had to do a piece and then if I wrapped it around it kind of looked stupid so and remember
[6583.40 → 6590.02] okay so hold on if I wrapped it all the surrounding way would slip off right so what
[6590.02 → 6597.34] I had to do was I had to uh i I lined it up on two sides and then I would tape all the way around
[6597.34 → 6604.40] and then I put the other two on and then taped all the way around and I had to do the top and then a
[6604.40 → 6610.18] little sliver at the bottom because it wasn't quite the right width and if I didn't do that then
[6610.18 → 6616.12] it would like fray and look crappy at the bottom if I wasn't looking this closely at it, I don't think
[6616.12 → 6623.42] anybody ever noticed or called me on this yeah, but this is very hand done oh it blends in perfectly
[6623.42 → 6630.18] was this yeah were we sponsored by tax for that show yeah wow wild yeah because we were still
[6630.18 → 6635.52] working with them on a regular basis yeah yeah also i just completely like lose the flag in
[6635.52 → 6644.08] this part of the shoot apparently so that's good job Linus um that man he deserves every bit
[6644.08 → 6650.34] of ego that he has he's destined for great things he is forgetting his mic he is um
[6650.34 → 6656.64] Tynan says I see nothing has changed it's just scaled up if it works I sits
[6656.64 → 6663.96] for sure okay uh what are we supposed to be talking about probably do sponsors no we should
[6663.96 → 6668.60] do a topic we have to do another topic you get one topic and then you have to eat your peas okay Dan
[6668.60 → 6672.94] you can pick the topic though okay oh no this is too much pressure I've never had to do this before
[6672.94 → 6678.34] well I mean if we're stalking about uh if we're talking about sponsors that's a weird Freudian slip
[6678.34 → 6687.90] do you no it's not it's normal don't go outside for a few hours uh all right just for that
[6687.90 → 6697.38] trade war escalates oh, oh okay how about discord trials discord sounds fun that's a very oh yes great
[6697.38 → 6703.90] platform that I like very much discord has his hot water this week as New Jersey becomes the first
[6703.90 → 6710.50] state to sue the platform alleging it failed to protect kids from harassment abuse and sexual
[6710.50 → 6716.60] exploitation the lawsuit claims discord marketed itself as a safe place for kids I don't think I've
[6716.60 → 6722.46] personally seen that I've ever seen that but okay uh even though it knew its safety tools didn't work
[6722.46 → 6729.12] that I believe me too it highlights how easy it is for predators to contact minors thanks to
[6729.12 → 6736.58] discord's default settings that's true yep um and lack of real age verification typing in a birthday
[6736.58 → 6743.56] doesn't count meanwhile discord is quietly testing a new age verification system in the UK and Australia
[6743.56 → 6750.98] that asks users to scan their face or upload an id which sounds horrific, so yeah can I interrupt for a
[6750.98 → 6756.34] second here and say like yes discord lacks real age verification typing in a birthday doesn't count
[6756.34 → 6760.08] that totally makes sense that's totally true but what else are they supposed to do I have
[6760.08 → 6763.74] no idea I don't want them to do anything I don't want them to do this other thing sounds horrible
[6763.74 → 6768.88] sorry I would like if they change the defaults that's it maybe if they added a parental control
[6768.88 → 6776.12] mode does that exist wait the system isn't all the time yeah it's only when you encounter flagged
[6776.12 → 6780.80] NSFW content or try to change your sensitive content filter that helps a little but not much
[6780.80 → 6788.12] yeah okay carry on uh users can verify by using their phone's camera for a face scan or scanning a
[6788.12 → 6795.98] QR code to submit a photo of government I'd submit indeed discord yeah discord insists the data isn't
[6795.98 → 6802.04] stored face scans are processed on device and ID images are deleted after verification meaning they're
[6802.04 → 6807.08] stored for a small period of time but anyway uh if the system flags someone as underage they can
[6807.08 → 6814.80] retry request a manual review or risk a ban hmm I wonder if it's a ban from viewing that type of
[6814.80 → 6819.82] content or a ban off the platform probably a ban off the platform um I had one of my kids discord
[6819.82 → 6826.88] account removed um because they figured out they were a minor somehow um and then I made a new account for
[6826.88 → 6835.52] them is there parental controls for discord not very good, but they like to exist well with my kids the
[6835.52 → 6840.72] parental controls are that I know your password and that I am I have full access to your computer
[6840.72 → 6842.18] as your parent
[6842.18 → 6845.74] yeah
[6845.74 → 6853.58] uh, uh genesis says uh someone probably reported your kid yeah that makes sense
[6853.58 → 6860.14] um funny anyway yeah this move appears to be discord's way of staying ahead of tightening
[6860.14 → 6865.30] regulations like the UK's online safety act and Australia's rules banning under 16s from social
[6865.30 → 6871.10] media uh our discussion question though is can any platform realistically protect kids without
[6871.10 → 6876.14] unreasonably sacrificing privacy or usability thank you Luke this is a really long and nuanced
[6876.14 → 6881.66] conversation it's perfect that we're able to like turn this into an into an actual topic we can
[6881.66 → 6888.14] discuss rather than just reading a thing I think we need better strong parental controls like
[6888.14 → 6895.10] everywhere and i I don't think these types like uh uploading your ID to freaking every platform that
[6895.10 → 6898.78] exists is not an acceptable solution in my opinion I can tell you right now parental controls are not
[6898.78 → 6903.50] going to be a solution either parental controls exist for lots of these lots of platforms even if they
[6903.50 → 6907.02] do or don't for discord and parents don't use them parents don't use them parents don't even
[6907.02 → 6912.46] understand them like I've I've talked I've told this story before but like hanging out with Norrie
[6912.46 → 6918.94] parents of my kids friends has been extremely eye-opening for me yeah they literally don't even
[6918.94 → 6924.62] know what the discord is yeah that's crazy until the school sends out a memo warning about kids
[6925.26 → 6929.74] bullying each other on discord they're like whoa what's a discord they literally don't even
[6929.74 → 6935.50] know and their kids are like over 10, and they're like all on discord of course they're that's wild
[6935.50 → 6940.62] i just i the biggest pushback for me is not actually the fact that like it's extremely obvious
[6940.62 → 6944.06] that one of these platforms is going to get hacked at some point in time and there's going to be some
[6944.06 → 6948.70] form of man in the middle thing, and they're like we don't store it but yeah the malicious attacker does
[6949.26 → 6955.26] that's not even my main complaint my main complaint is the person that could be potentially trying to
[6955.26 → 6962.54] exploit your child sure could try to use some form of phishing style attack to get them to give them
[6962.54 → 6969.26] photos or potentially their ID because if you normalize the idea of these platforms asking for
[6969.26 → 6975.74] photos and ID you now create a phishing scenario where you can ask for photos and ID, and we should
[6975.74 → 6981.18] just not do this to begin with and my I really don't think you're going to stop anything people
[6981.18 → 6987.34] will very likely find ways around this I mean part of the problem too is just how archaic our ID systems
[6987.34 → 6992.86] are like the fact that your social security number or in Canada your sin number is like a permanent
[6992.86 → 7000.30] number and like once people have it they like to have it and can do stuff with it that's insane I mean even
[7000.30 → 7006.62] a credit card right has to expire every few years so that someone who so if it's compromised they don't
[7006.62 → 7013.18] just have it forever, and it's way less important in the grand scheme of things than a sin number or an
[7013.18 → 7020.38] SSN like it that's insane but here we are yeah like uh I'll just pay for Equifax forever
[7021.42 → 7027.58] that's a good system yeah until they get hacked um I get it free because they got hacked me too
[7027.58 → 7030.70] it's not even a joke
[7033.10 → 7040.14] fox NZ I'm assuming New Zealand says discord can't stop phishers abusing their QR code logins on the browser
[7040.14 → 7045.50] why should we trust them for scanning faces and ID securely this is my point, and it honestly has
[7045.50 → 7051.34] nothing to do with trusting discord you can't trust any of them yeah it's not it's not I'm not even i
[7051.34 → 7059.18] don't know I don't know actually I know i I take it I take extreme exception
[7061.74 → 7062.86] Mr Mark Zuckerberg
[7062.86 → 7072.46] has it I was wondering where he's going to go with it can't even trust 4chan Facebook engaged in
[7072.46 → 7075.02] absolutely no anti-competitive
[7078.14 → 7082.86] sorry I can't even I can't even that would be such a difficult like thing to try to
[7082.86 → 7089.58] defend I can't even do it with a straight face yeah okay um I trust Luke don't that's my point
[7089.58 → 7095.58] is like I don't like we can trust him but verify yeah that's allowed yeah that's allowed my uh
[7095.58 → 7101.26] you can trust me bro as long as LTT store continues to have an excellent track record of taking care
[7101.26 → 7106.62] of our customers but once it doesn't any more then you shouldn't yeah like we uh yeah someone said
[7106.62 → 7111.90] even the leg forum got hacked that's my point yep to be honest and like it's been a while and that's
[7111.90 → 7116.06] great I'm happy about that, but it might happen again someday yeah I mean we don't write the
[7116.06 → 7123.98] software the forum run time no you know so like we do our best but yeah uh it is what it is every
[7123.98 → 7130.70] platform is vulnerable every single thing ever every lock every physical lock every software lock every
[7130.70 → 7136.14] door every wall every single thing ever is vulnerable to something this is wild nothing is
[7136.14 → 7141.42] ever dead anti-social and float plane chat uh my wife got a letter in the mail trying to sell her stuff
[7142.14 → 7145.74] it was addressed to her fake name that she only uses on Facebook

[7341.34 → 7344.54] that was a pretty I don't know if this was even planned for but I thought that was a pretty clever
[7344.54 → 7350.22] sponsor for the like detective um what is the name too much water
[7353.02 → 7360.46] really yeah you guys are water boys today I don't know why I have an iron bladder I think it's from i
[7361.50 → 7368.38] I refer to it as gamer bladder yeah I've started adopting gamer bladder as well yeah sorry
[7368.38 → 7376.30] I was muted there um but yeah it's like I don't know I don't know yeah something about today yeah
[7376.86 → 7381.18] speaking about today should we do a merch message break or should I find another article
[7381.82 → 7388.46] uh topic why did I say article I mean there are articles sort of I guess maybe I guess
[7388.46 → 7393.98] merch message yes no question mark oh I think there's another one in here for you
[7397.98 → 7403.74] hey Luke what's up do you prefer working on your soft skills or technical skills I've always been
[7403.74 → 7410.30] told my soft skills are great so I end up in main positions but sometimes I hesitate if it's the right call
[7410.30 → 7421.10] I find working on technical skills to be more fun and feel more rewarding at the moment I feel like
[7421.10 → 7428.62] working on soft skills is less fun especially because working on something often means failing to a certain
[7428.62 → 7438.30] degree and failing with soft skills sucks um but I find the long-term not like short short-term
[7438.30 → 7445.90] dopaminergic response but the long-term uh deep appreciation response to working on soft skills to be higher
[7446.46 → 7454.94] um yeah maybe that's a good answer maybe not we'll run with that uh maybe I'll find another topic
[7454.94 → 7457.18] because I was relatively short do you have any thoughts on that Dan
[7460.06 → 7463.66] I don't know the thing is like your hard skills can be done
[7463.66 → 7470.22] on by yourself soft skills you need other people to do that and so if you're not if you're not setting
[7470.22 → 7475.18] up an environment where you're interacting with people to uh you know work on soft skills then it's not
[7476.38 → 7484.22] yeah yeah you want to jump to the pool robot uh video you're going to say controversy thing I don't even
[7484.22 → 7487.98] know what it is to be honest I don't know what it is either oh yeah we uploaded our pool cleaning
[7487.98 → 7492.86] robot video today which obviously stirred up some comments um so we want to have an open discussion
[7492.86 → 7497.66] with you guys point number one why don't they just go rent a pool somewhere else so they don't have to
[7497.66 → 7503.34] blur things um finding people to loan us a pool actually is not that easy especially if we're gonna
[7503.34 → 7511.02] like Huck stuff in it is needs to be not clean yeah um those pools that you can rent are going to be clean
[7511.98 → 7517.50] so yeah we blur surroundings to protect privacy to the greatest degree that we can, we always try to blur
[7517.50 → 7521.82] something if we can, and it's better slash faster to have the auto blur tool navigate around the
[7521.82 → 7526.38] host rather than trying to track individual windows if the camera's moving uh point number two why do
[7526.38 → 7534.62] we make pool bot videos short answer is right in the name of the video showcase um got a great world
[7534.62 → 7541.42] class team here they need great world-class money um we've always tried to be extremely clear when we
[7541.42 → 7551.26] do these showcases versus an editorial or a sponsored video that is integrated into the content um we
[7551.26 → 7555.90] explained this in our how LTT makes money video, and ultimately we turn down way more offers for
[7555.90 → 7560.54] showcases than we accept it's only when we think we can make a video that's worth watching I mean i
[7560.54 → 7564.14] watched that video I thought it was actually pretty entertaining I think Elijah did a great job
[7564.14 → 7570.22] um, and we let the host kind of carry the entertainment when we decide to take these kinds
[7570.22 → 7575.10] of showcases we also attempt to upload them on uh low performing days to not take away from the
[7575.10 → 7580.86] other videos we might post that week so it would be typical for a video like that to go up on a Friday
[7580.86 → 7585.98] when if you are more into things that are not just a sponsored pool robot video you could also watch the
[7585.98 → 7592.06] wan show, so discussion question here is what could we improve next time I mean I think there's a lot of
[7592.06 → 7595.74] things that we could improve I think we could probably frame a little bit more carefully day
[7595.74 → 7602.86] of um you know try to make it so we don't have to blur as much I think that um I think that's the
[7602.86 → 7607.74] the biggest one I think that's what most people were mostly concerned about was the blurring but in terms
[7607.74 → 7614.06] of the actual content of the video I don't know i actually i I can I actually kind of enjoyed it i
[7614.06 → 7618.38] thought Elijah did a great job and I thought it was interesting to see yeah what is the actual difference
[7618.38 → 7622.54] in cleaning speed for the robot versus me for those of you who don't want to watch the video
[7622.54 → 7627.90] because uh blurring that's a smart angle because I understand this content could be difficult to
[7628.70 → 7632.38] make interesting but I'm skimming through it right now and that seems kind of cool actually the robot
[7632.38 → 7636.62] took a few hours it didn't get everything, but it had enough battery left that it could probably do
[7636.62 → 7645.42] another pass and like it would be done at that point um and I took an hour so I beat it by a factor of
[7645.42 → 7651.90] like six, but it also took you an hour but I personally spent an hour dragging sand and rocks
[7651.90 → 7663.58] and fake leaves out of my pool that Elijah put there yeah yeah i also that guy his stupid sand that here
[7663.58 → 7669.66] I'm going to say I'm going to give this to I'll send this to dan if you want to show this on stream um
[7669.66 → 7683.66] that guy uh here hold on yeah I sent this to him yeah I'm gonna uh here someone just said an hour of
[7683.66 → 7688.62] CVO time on cleaning a pool yeah but as the vision officer he could see the stuff at the bottom of the
[7688.62 → 7697.74] pool more easily, and you forget that my main role is not really CVO it's just a's just a role that
[7697.74 → 7703.18] kind of works to describe the most important thing that I do grand scheme of things but the thing that
[7703.18 → 7708.62] I actually spend the majority of my time on day today is more along the lines of primary host and
[7708.62 → 7716.46] editor-in-chief um oh no and that that that encompasses a lot of different things like today
[7716.46 → 7722.30] I was actually on set for an entire shoot that I participated in only minimally just as a training
[7722.30 → 7729.10] exercise for a couple of hosts one of whom was relatively uh inexperienced still, and you know
[7729.10 → 7734.86] they just wanted me to yeah I thought this is cool I thought that was really cool because the goal has
[7734.86 → 7740.54] always been to be a real company that isn't just a YouTuber and his band of merry men you know and some
[7740.54 → 7746.30] women even these days um it was to be a real company right and part of being a real company is
[7746.30 → 7753.82] succession I am not going to be young and hip and cool well ever but um I'll be even less young
[7753.82 → 7759.02] and less hip and less cool tomorrow than I was yesterday what do you mean I know that's not very
[7759.02 → 7767.02] narcissistic i know well what happened there well it's almost oh no okay do you want to see the
[7767.02 → 7769.50] picture let's look at the picture let's look at the picture I sent Elijah
[7772.78 → 7781.02] what I can't here can you zoom in Dan can you show us can you show us my filter for my pool those are
[7781.02 → 7790.30] your pool filters yeah oh no that's the smallest sand I think I've ever seen those are not cheap
[7790.30 → 7802.14] anyway what a guy what a guy what a guy, but yeah anyway so pool bot video uh basically i I'm
[7802.14 → 7811.58] sorry but I'll do it again yeah well I like a full disclosure right full disclosure we're fully disclosing
[7811.58 → 7816.62] everything that we're doing and if you want to watch a review we have that and if you want to watch a
[7816.62 → 7820.54] showcase of a pool robot we have that, and we labelled it very clearly, and we put it on a day when you were
[7820.54 → 7829.58] going to get other content anyway so which is like pretty sick I stack the content yep I'm sorry
[7830.62 → 7838.22] about the overuse of blur i yeah I was skimming through if it was a little egregious sometimes I get
[7838.22 → 7842.78] it, but you got to do that once and experience and then go okay we can what are the things we can do
[7842.78 → 7848.06] about it next time, but sometimes there's well there are new factors new areas that we didn't
[7848.06 → 7855.18] anticipate needing to blur so it is what it is got it I mean I've we have actually talked internally
[7855.18 → 7861.90] for years and years and years about just buying a house that is like a filming house uh like the old
[7861.90 → 7866.94] days except we don't actually operate the company there we just use it as a filming set
[7866.94 → 7874.38] anyone close to here would be kind of i my main objection to it is that we are taking a house
[7874.38 → 7881.50] off the market that someone could live in which like blows uh-huh like shouldn't matter if we made
[7881.50 → 7887.90] enough houses, but we don't, but we don't so it does matter we don't make enough houses so and by we i
[7887.90 → 7891.66] don't mean like us personally I mean like we collectively here in the area that we live
[7891.66 → 7899.34] what if you built one um that was like a set house that's still a piece of residential zoned
[7899.34 → 7903.18] property that another developer almost certainly would have built a house you build a set house
[7903.18 → 7907.98] on non-residential zoned property I bet so oh my god okay now I don't want to spend that kind of money
[7907.98 → 7914.06] on a house that no one will ever live in so separate problem um I mean nothing's impossible but it
[7914.06 → 7918.14] wouldn't have like a pool like it wouldn't be like a proper house it would have to be more like a set
[7918.14 → 7923.10] it has to have a pool to be a proper house well no I wouldn't help us with pool robots
[7925.26 → 7929.50] now you need a house with like four pools, so one can be getting dirty indoor pool
[7932.70 → 7937.98] a dirty pool factory robot race four-way race we need four pools yeah we couldn't possibly have them
[7937.98 → 7943.58] clean the pool one at a time in cereal it would take too long um okay what are we supposed to be talking
[7943.58 → 7954.14] about uh some other topic uh let's see how about we do uh good guy moves from companies we asked you
[7954.14 → 7959.42] guys last week to come up with some good guy moves from companies for an upcoming LTT and I thought we
[7959.42 → 7963.98] were going to be pretty led on topics this week so I thought hey we'd highlight some of the really
[7963.98 → 7968.70] good ones that you guys have come up with already uh Dan if you want to post the Reddit thread so if
[7968.70 → 7973.50] people could add more to them that would be awesome um and so yeah I want to highlight some of the cool
[7973.50 → 7979.74] ones you guys came up with and also uh solicit more examples of good guy moves from companies so here's
[7979.74 → 7984.78] a few perfect ones this is from real train bittersweet one but Google's handling of the stadia
[7984.78 → 7990.30] shutdown they refunded every game purchase and unlocked the proprietary controllers allowing them to be used
[7990.30 → 7995.74] as generic Bluetooth and wired controllers that was a good guy move that was cool that was actually
[7995.74 → 8001.98] legitimately cool gimmick music one says for all the people give Nintendo when the Wii U had such
[8001.98 → 8007.26] atrocious sales the executives at Nintendo all took pay cuts so they would not need to lay anybody off
[8007.26 → 8011.50] I reference this often it's a decision that has stuck with me even today in the grand scheme of
[8011.50 → 8016.46] triple-a gaming I don't think that Nintendo has ever implemented mass layoffs like son yea or Microsoft
[8016.46 → 8024.30] etc yes and flack freak says Microsoft of all companies still developing balancing and supporting age of
[8024.30 → 8032.30] empires 2 since 1999 and doing it on steam not Microsoft store it's a smaller example, but it's
[8032.30 → 8035.98] a pretty cool one I'm surprised Microsoft didn't get in there for their accessibility controllers but
[8035.98 → 8041.34] I will also that's just a few examples the Wii U thing happened in like uh I don't know the Wii
[8041.34 → 8047.42] u launched in 2012 so I'm assuming 2013 and Google Stadia was announced we shut down in 2022 so when we
[8047.42 → 8052.30] dug down for examples of companies doing good things we had to oh I already closed them oh we looked over
[8052.30 → 8057.50] for a span of a decade yeah well give the community time they're going to find more stuff yeah they're
[8057.50 → 8063.10] going to do it they're going to do it there is other more recent examples I'm just saying all right
[8064.78 → 8069.66] what else we got oh shoot lots of topics I accidentally collapsed a few of my like
[8069.66 → 8076.46] backup topics here so I'll leave that one open um oh I see I'm gonna call out yeah
[8076.46 → 8081.50] I'm going to move them for you oh my goodness let's just do that one now oh, oh it's gone oh my goodness
[8082.54 → 8086.62] Dan oh you're killing me okay fine uh where is it now
[8088.70 → 8091.50] oh what happened why is the RTX 5060 one
[8093.42 → 8096.78] good old doc I'm gonna I'm going to put it above its just under main topics
[8096.78 → 8102.86] uh-oh okay let's just do it now thank you Daniel lesser uh do what now these topics talking about the
[8102.86 → 8107.02] mic challenges well no we still have other topics we have like two we have like seven more topics
[8107.02 → 8116.54] oh do any of them matter 30. Uh hp agrees to a settlement over claims of falsely advertising pc and
[8116.54 → 8123.34] keyboards um they're paying four million dollars after a class action complaint accused the pc maker
[8123.34 → 8128.86] of showing misleading original pricing for various computer mouse and keyboard products on their website
[8128.86 → 8137.02] among the claims uh the suit alleged that hp.com advertised an AI o printer on sale for 899 and
[8137.02 → 8144.54] claimed the customer would save 100 instantly though the printer had not been advertised for 999 for
[8144.54 → 8152.14] more than six months Perm sale is that a thing Perm sale it's well that's what I call it what's
[8152.14 → 8156.78] the what's the like what's the maximum end of how long you can have a sale on for that's what fun fact
[8156.78 → 8161.82] that's why NCI had a weekly special yeah yeah where you'd have the same item in the weekly special
[8161.82 → 8166.22] and there would be a few hours in between the weekly special every week
[8169.34 → 8177.50] that's so much better so that you could have hard drives on sale always, but they would not be
[8177.50 → 8183.10] in violation of any there was a significant period of my life where i I went meticulously through every
[8183.10 → 8190.94] single NCI weekly oh me too yeah Hondo p yeah um anyway hp isn't admitting any fault or liability
[8190.94 → 8196.22] but the settlement will see the original complainants um will get them up to five thousand dollars each
[8196.22 → 8199.58] which along with lawyer fees will come out of the four million dollar settlement pool
[8199.58 → 8205.90] while class members will receive 10 to 100 depending on the product purchased and this is why I look at
[8205.90 → 8211.82] class actions and I'm just like okay that was perfect use of time for so neat anyone other
[8211.82 → 8219.66] than the lawyer who was involved hey how are all those honey lawsuits going who knows
[8220.30 → 8225.58] and I don't think anyone cares anymore has Beale even like you were a much more interesting target
[8225.58 → 8232.94] than honey I think yeah I think so yeah I think so um forget that company I found an individual
[8232.94 → 8239.18] um what is this EU thinks of children and takes action against harmful practices and video games
[8239.18 → 8244.46] yeah this is cool what is this after a complaint by the Swedish consumers association the consumer
[8244.46 → 8253.10] protection corporation network CPC has taken action against star stable entertainment a b makers of the
[8253.10 → 8259.02] massively multiplayer star stable online can you call it massively multiplayer if I've never heard of it and
[8259.02 → 8265.98] Luke's never heard of it for pc and mac and the star stable horses app for android and iOS I suspect
[8265.98 → 8270.94] that's more popular well I'll be working on this for now, and you do fantastic it's a horse game
[8272.14 → 8278.30] anyway carry on wow the graphics are oh I think I've I've heard of this is obscenely
[8278.30 → 8288.14] popular oh it's its like girlie's crack oh that makes sense yeah that makes sense why we probably
[8288.14 → 8293.98] haven't heard of it right yeah I love how the hair on the horse is like amazing
[8297.34 → 8302.46] yeah well you carry on I'm going to be creating my character doing that perfect um yeah so they have
[8302.46 → 8308.94] yeah uh a MMO for pc and mac, and they have star stable horses app for android and iOS the CPC identified
[8308.94 → 8314.22] a number of practices that violate EU consumer protection regulations which could be harmful to
[8314.22 → 8319.74] children including direct appeals to children in advertisements the use of pressuring techniques
[8319.74 → 8325.98] such as purchase through time limited practices a lack of clear and transparent information and failure
[8325.98 → 8331.34] by the company to ensure that the influencers promoting their products clearly disclose commercial
[8331.34 → 8339.26] content ah yes classic star stable entertainment has one month to respond with a plan to address these
[8339.26 → 8345.74] issues discussion question what do you think of this seemingly very cooperative approach to enforcement
[8346.78 → 8355.10] um I don't know it seems cool I don't have a ton to say to that um by cooperative do they mean the
[8355.10 → 8360.30] two different organizations teaming up because that happens elsewhere as well I've seen that before
[8360.86 → 8365.58] um I think it can make sense though often it's resource sharing and stuff like that
[8365.58 → 8371.58] um discussion question could star stable replace tape to tape as Linus's go-to game
[8374.62 → 8379.90] Jordan says I made you an account it's under the Ltd games in the password manager download here
[8379.90 → 8385.18] you're just playing in the browser do you want the more full fad experience i I can keep doing topics
[8385.18 → 8389.74] and I think my experience has already got enough you're not even through the character creator are you
[8390.30 → 8394.14] no I'm not oh, but you've got you've got an account I feel like you got to download it
[8394.14 → 8401.42] uh I really don't think I do I think this is important content I don't think I do I feel like
[8401.42 → 8408.70] you're doing a disservice to the people um by not getting a ribbon or something anyway the EU seems to
[8408.70 → 8415.58] be figuring out things pretty good for the most part this seems like another positive step in my opinion
[8415.58 → 8420.62] even though he didn't do it Jordan I appreciate that you set up an account for him and everything
[8421.26 → 8427.10] I think it was valuable um open AI is doing something probably horrible yeah
[8427.10 → 8433.58] yeah let's not care about that any more thing that suck skate sounds good um intel investigating arc
[8433.58 → 8439.18] performance with older CPUs what yeah open AI wants to build a social app basically cool
[8439.18 → 8444.86] uh yeah no it's ancient news but intel's finally acknowledged, and they are investigating the CPU
[8444.86 → 8456.30] overhead issues um with running arc GPUs on older intel and AMD CPUs um so yeah they're going to be all sad
[8456.30 → 8460.38] because we brushed over that topic it's not that we don't think the topic is important yeah it's
[8460.38 → 8467.82] whoever wrote this it's its just so gross I like I don't want to talk about it open AI is a thing yeah
[8472.30 → 8477.66] either way they want to make an app, and then you can share your generated images on it so you can
[8478.38 → 8484.54] show your ghibli drawings to other people that you didn't draw sick, and they can look at it and
[8484.54 → 8489.90] show you their things that they didn't draw in other good news uh Blue Origin practices sending
[8489.90 → 8495.58] millionaires to space for when the world ends maybe their ns-31 flight launched on April 14th
[8495.58 → 8500.70] and made headlines for being an all-female crew the voyage was just under 11 minutes long and stirred
[8500.70 → 8506.38] up lots of controversy ranging from outrage that celebrities are going to space to even claims that
[8506.38 → 8511.74] the flight was faked yep celebrities included pop star Katie perry broadcast journalist Gail king
[8511.74 → 8517.90] philanthropist Lauren Sánchez philanthropist okay so wife of Jeff Bezos and film producer I'm happy you
[8517.90 → 8523.26] reacted to that carry ann Flynn the other two members included former NASA rocket scientist
[8523.26 → 8529.18] Aisha bow and bioastronautics research scientist Amanda Newman some I'm not even going to talk
[8529.18 → 8535.02] about the theories that it's fake they're really stupid um it's just filming stuff and timing yeah
[8535.02 → 8538.86] don't worry about that was open already because they had to make sure they were okay oh fiancé not
[8538.86 → 8544.38] wife yeah, thank you um whatever okay so do people hate Katie perry now like why do people hate Katie
[8544.38 → 8551.42] perry i I don't actually know I literally don't know and honestly deeply fundamentally to my core
[8551.42 → 8558.62] don't care she's fake they turned on her, they married oh she married Russell brand is she still
[8558.62 → 8565.02] Russell married to Russell brand oh yeah he's an idiot uh
[8565.02 → 8574.70] no they broke up dude they broke up we're married from 2010 to 2012 what are you even talking about
[8574.70 → 8582.46] nothing to do yeah that oh that's oh that's such a lame reason there's not there's no way there's no way
[8582.46 → 8591.10] because they liked her way after that there 's's no way I don't believe it um I don't know man
[8591.10 → 8597.74] people seem to her new song was terrible I think she collaborated with some
[8598.78 → 8604.30] guy that people don't like on it or something worked with the shady DJ yeah she collaborated with
[8604.30 → 8609.42] some guy, and they didn't like that guy and something okay I mean there's maybe something there
[8610.78 → 8616.62] anyway yeah people seemed like really mad that she went to space and some people seem especially mad
[8616.62 → 8621.74] that like celebrities like went to space just because they're celebrities but i have to be honest
[8621.74 → 8628.22] with you guys like I'd do it the thing if they offered to send tech tips man to space questionably
[8628.22 → 8634.62] and like if we're is we're having real talk right now you'd do it yeah I wouldn't blame Katie
[8634.62 → 8640.86] perry for this one yeah sorry oh something to consider as well about these people is you're mad
[8640.86 → 8649.42] about the stuff that you see like trust me there are so many things you don't see uh, uh and like the
[8649.42 → 8654.30] whole reason that you're seeing it and talking about it at all is because they did this with
[8654.30 → 8659.90] celebrities if they had only sent the scientists no one would even know this apparently is oh hold on
[8659.90 → 8667.50] no this is definitely not footage that we can just use on wan show but uh we can watch it uh Jeff Bezos
[8667.50 → 8674.54] apparently face plants as part of the whole thing like on purpose no I don't think so
[8677.26 → 8681.66] sorry okay watch here hold on hold on
[8686.78 → 8691.34] he didn't even face no, but it's pretty funny he caught himself no it's pretty funny I mean anyone
[8691.34 → 8696.06] falling yeah anyone but anyone falling is funny it's just I don't know it's funnier when it's a
[8696.06 → 8700.62] billionaire yeah, yeah so it was funny but like he did catch himself to be clear I don't I don't
[8700.62 → 8705.74] actually know enough about Jeff Bezos to like hate him he's just a billionaire to me, I don't
[8705.74 → 8711.82] think he's seeming much worse than other billionaires I could be mistaken about that how much money do you
[8711.82 → 8718.54] think he made in the time that he lost his balance and then hit the ground uh that's going to keep me up
[8718.54 → 8726.62] tonight it was only about two or three seconds but like that's got to be like an annual salary for
[8726.62 → 8731.82] someone yeah like for sure probably multiple yeah that hurts
[8734.46 → 8740.94] anywho uh yeah people are upset because the door opened before Bezos went and like did the turn the
[8740.94 → 8747.02] crank thing um I think it was for filming reasons I suspect they opened the door like right away
[8747.58 → 8752.86] to make sure that they were chill I haven't looked into it almost at all but I'm just assuming that
[8752.86 → 8755.58] the second they were like oh they opened the door, and then they closed it, and they opened it
[8755.58 → 8762.46] ceremoniously I was like yeah uh red tape and filming this is like yeah a thing like this may surprise
[8762.46 → 8768.86] you but when we do our grand opening party at smash champs in a couple of months the mayor's going to cut a
[8768.86 → 8778.70] ribbon smash champs was already open yeah for like a while yeah it's okay it's okay it's all right
[8778.70 → 8783.34] it's its uh yeah it's performative and that's that's okay sometimes yeah I don't know the whole
[8783.34 → 8786.94] story there might be other things behind it, I don't know but the the the like little bit of the clip
[8786.94 → 8790.46] that I saw I'm like they open the door, and then he goes and like kind of waves at them and closes the
[8790.46 → 8795.02] door again, and he's like uh it is looks like he's like oh no, no we need the door closed still we're
[8795.02 → 8799.82] going to get the shot, and then he closes the door yeah it's like okay yeah it's probably stuffy in
[8799.82 → 8807.10] there, and they wanted to open the door whatever who knows all right what are we doing create a
[8807.10 → 8812.70] warehouse product sightings roundup it's been a lot of it oh yeah this is pretty cool uh john gadget

[8918.94 → 8926.70] silicone Ltd driver in his pain machine video the screwdriver yeah so this one-of-a-kind Ltd
[8926.70 → 8934.22] flesh driver was made by Sebastian from CW uh it was unsanctioned it was after hours, and he presented
[8934.22 → 8940.78] it to William at open sauce last year SEB said he made the abomination because it was a terrible thing
[8940.78 → 8946.78] to make and William would enjoy it he made the mould from a production screwdriver so that he could
[8946.78 → 8951.42] get the texture right you will have to do that yourself if you want one of these because we are
[8951.42 → 8953.82] not selling them no matter how much you beg
[8957.74 → 8963.50] that is horrible have you held it no this shouldn't exist you have to check out you have to
[8963.50 → 8970.38] check out the video it is one of the worst things it's so I feel like I feel like it in his hand would
[8970.38 → 8976.78] need to be blurred here could I can, I show this part of the video yeah just show it watch he'll show
[8976.78 → 8981.26] like he'll, he squeezes it then you see him pull it so you can tell it's like flexible that's why I call
[8981.26 → 8993.66] it the screwdriver I want to do his and hers that is horrible um neat anyway finally it's not the sound

[8998.78 → 9007.90] yeah sure uh Luke yeah do you want to play it whenever you're ready okay is anyone else's LTT
[9007.90 → 9015.34] screwdriver like this it's got like skin are they yanking my balls it's just mushy I don't want to
[9015.34 → 9021.66] say what it feels like I'm grabbing listen last week I figured out I was being charged
[9023.66 → 9032.78] I haven't heard this sound before that's so good that man is a genius
[9043.26 → 9049.42] that video in general is actually fascinating by the way it's really cool um it's all
[9049.42 → 9055.82] about having uh like cold hot, and it tricks you into thinking that you're like burning
[9056.38 → 9060.46] because of it's too close for your nerves or something he explains it all in the video
[9060.46 → 9064.78] uh, but it's its actually a really, really cool video I would suggest checking it out it's
[9064.78 → 9072.22] we are never making that product during work hours like ever during work hours I don't care I don't
[9072.22 → 9077.74] want people to like I don't want people to put a LTT logo there during work hours that's fair but it
[9077.74 → 9089.74] would sell like crazy no, no okay bootleg market finally it's not a creator warehouse product but
[9089.74 → 9095.34] it is something we built Doug de Miró gave an update on his Lamb racing rig it finally arrived
[9095.34 → 9098.62] and it sounds like they managed to beat the tariffs, but his team ran into a bit of trouble
[9098.62 → 9104.78] reassembling it because of whiskey done plans to have visitors set lap times in the rig and maintain
[9104.78 → 9110.54] a leaderboard so he responded to that here so you guys can go check that out for him as well
[9112.38 → 9118.86] okay I am we getting there when was done oh a discussion question what's the coolest LTT product
[9118.86 → 9124.38] sighting you've had I mean for me, I think the most fun ones are when I see someone wearing the hoodie
[9124.38 → 9131.50] or the backpack and I walk up and I'm just like nice hoodie or like nice backpack and then I keep
[9131.50 → 9136.30] moving, and they don't realize who I am me too I actually love that yeah I love playing that game
[9136.30 → 9139.18] I don't know if it's because they just bought the product because they think it's a good product they
[9139.18 → 9144.94] have no idea what LTT is or like me personally or if they just like were taken aback or didn't
[9144.94 → 9150.06] recognize me out of that context or whatever I don't care why i just I love it I love just being like hey
[9150.06 → 9155.18] hey nice backpack i I like thanks they legitimately probably don't know who I am
[9155.18 → 9159.90] because I'm not on camera as much any more um but I just take that as an opportunity to be like I don't
[9159.90 → 9165.26] know it is nice, and it looks good on them so I will tell them it's fine
[9170.22 → 9173.10] yeah trade war escalates stuff sucks
[9173.10 → 9180.06] I don't know trade war continues to ramp up NVIDIA expects 5.5 billion in losses AMD expects 800
[9180.06 → 9185.26] million in losses jetpack sport license restrictions to China smartphones semiconductors
[9185.26 → 9190.30] and consumer electronics are temporarily exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but it's still subject to a 20
[9190.30 → 9196.78] tariff that's because as far as I can tell uh Tim apple went to orange guy and was like
[9196.78 → 9202.70] please don't, and then he was like okay cool um other products now face up to 245 because numbers
[9202.70 → 9206.86] don't even matter anymore in stacked tariffs uh combining multiple rounds from both trump and
[9206.86 → 9212.14] Biden administrations in retaliation china has suspended exports of key rare earth metals and
[9212.14 → 9218.22] magnets potentially disrupting everything from aerospace to gaming peripherals NVIDIA has reaffirmed
[9218.22 → 9223.50] its 500 billion dollar commitment to U.S. production with Blackwell chips being manufactured at TSMC's
[9223.50 → 9229.34] Arizona fab Sony has hiked PS5 prices again in Europe I don't know how that makes any sense
[9229.34 → 9233.66] Australia and New Zealand as game consoles reportedly aren't exempt from the new tariffs
[9233.66 → 9239.50] apparently that's to blend their costs across all the regions so they're absorbing some of the
[9239.50 → 9244.14] cost of the tariffs by having consumers pay more worldwide that's interesting because they don't
[9244.14 → 9250.30] do it the other way around um switch 2 keeps its 449 dollar price launch price but accessories
[9250.30 → 9255.18] like joy cons and pro controllers are going up about five bucks which seems low to be honest
[9255.18 → 9261.34] U.S. consumers are turning to Chinese shopping apps like DH gate and Taobao which are now topping
[9261.34 → 9267.34] the app store charts as people try to buy direct and dodge heavy markup platforms like Xian and time
[9267.34 → 9274.70] I don't think that's going to work brush well it'll work for now for like a little bit yeah well I talked
[9274.70 → 9281.18] about how people are apparently like stocking up hard on non-essentials yeah fair yeah yeah
[9281.18 → 9285.74] I've had people being reaching out saying like I'm worried that my computer isn't going to make it
[9285.74 → 9290.38] I won't be able to afford it on the other end I can technically afford it now so I'm going to jump now
[9290.38 → 9297.66] just to give you some idea Luke of the absolute like insanity of what we're seeing right now um
[9299.10 → 9308.86] our net sales for q2 of 2024 so for those of you not familiar with the q system um we're 18 days into q2
[9308.86 → 9316.54] it goes from April to the end of June beginning of April end of June our numbers for q2 of last year
[9317.82 → 9321.26] are slightly lower what we have done in the last 18 days
[9323.34 → 9324.06] slightly lower
[9328.14 → 9333.34] what obviously people like shipping promos, and it's not it's not wondering why we have a promo
[9333.34 → 9338.06] on lttstore.com where over 150 you get free shipping anywhere in the world by now
[9338.70 → 9344.30] MCM is discounted, so obviously the margins are a little lower uh a lot lower uh this time around so
[9344.30 → 9349.50] it's not actually like from a profit standpoint that that's not that's not how it works yeah um but
[9349.50 → 9357.90] a big part of it is also just people knowing like okay if is tariffs at you know potentially hundreds of
[9357.90 → 9364.70] percent do go into effect on may the second costs are going to go up in a very substantial way on
[9364.70 → 9370.54] items that are manufactured over overseas particularly in China so if I want something that's made in China
[9370.54 → 9376.86] which like a lot of things are um now's the time to get on it yeah
[9376.86 → 9382.86] all right do you uh do you want to um I think
[9384.78 → 9390.54] these are interesting topics these two here probably we could do these next week um I'm really
[9390.54 → 9393.82] excited to collab with badminton insight but I think we've already kind of talked about that oh have we
[9393.82 → 9401.82] talked about how nerd sports is coming back Dan do you know nerd sports is getting a new episode I think
[9401.82 → 9408.30] now it's official okay we're doing it so the pro players that we're going to be playing against are
[9409.10 → 9416.06] um going to be um Greg and jenny from badminton insight who recently reached the semi-finals
[9416.06 → 9420.94] at the all England open which is kind of a big deal badminton tournament they put on the performance of
[9420.94 → 9428.86] a lifetime um in front of the home crowned for you and slip a home crowd uh in England and
[9428.86 → 9432.94] uh they're coming out here to do a tour of the facility, and they will also be shooting nerd sports
[9432.94 → 9441.02] with us uh David who has the genius behind our last couple of April fools videos fantastic is going
[9441.02 → 9445.42] to be the writer producer for it most recent scrapyard wars the budget's a little lower on this one
[9445.42 → 9450.14] because channel super fun doesn't make money but I think we did find a sponsor so we are we're making
[9450.14 → 9455.26] it works we're giving it a little bit of resources so we're doing one more you know last hurrah episode
[9455.26 → 9460.38] of nerd sports and I'm actually really excited I will not be playing for the keyboard warriors though
[9460.38 → 9466.70] who's playing this time I am too good at badminton yeah I mean to properly be like a Joe's against pros
[9467.26 → 9475.26] player who's playing um I don't oh should I reveal it oh I don't know I think we could talk about it
[9475.26 → 9480.94] next week I'm I think the plan is to have four, but you know it's really late to bother David I'm not
[9480.94 → 9486.22] going to bother David um I was interested but i I never got tapped I think the plan is to have four
[9486.22 → 9494.70] players um, and they'll tag team they'll tag team out oh um, and we have some fresh we have some really
[9494.70 → 9500.14] great challenges for the pros David and I were there yesterday I think it was and I was trying a
[9500.14 → 9505.90] lot of the challenges for myself so um Greg and jenny might watch this so I don't want them to know
[9505.90 → 9510.06] what's coming, but you don't want to spoil it for yeah I don't want to spoil it for anybody but we
[9510.06 → 9518.86] have some fun interesting challenges nice um exciting and I'm really excited sweet there that's it that's
[9518.86 → 9524.46] all I have to say about that very cool my mom always told me life's like a box of chocolates I might uh
[9524.46 → 9532.54] I might show up and hang out in the premium section just watch okay we're not allowing spectators in
[9532.54 → 9536.54] general but I'll make a one exception for Luke because he helped us configure our gym he's
[9536.54 → 9540.22] allowed in the gym whenever he wants he actually put a lot of work into it and our gym is super nice
[9540.22 → 9544.30] I got so many compliments on our gym it's pretty people come up to me tears in their eyes it's this
[9544.30 → 9551.58] is the greatest gym I've ever seen your gym beautiful gym it's wide it's wide
[9551.58 → 9562.62] um it's pretty yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good okay um yeah let's let's switch after dark I still
[9562.62 → 9569.82] wish I had a green trail let's do it after dark time it's pretty good maybe one day wow look how fast
[9569.82 → 9577.58] it got whoa you should get his fingers warmed up with lots of merch messages every week is that it Dan is
[9577.58 → 9582.62] that what's going on uh no it is the flow it made a little bit more sense tonight I think
[9583.34 → 9587.02] a couple of weeks ago you're just like no we're not doing any of these okay right after dark I was
[9587.02 → 9592.62] just scrambling I could see this the denouement right we gotta do a better job than we
[9592.62 → 9598.94] gotta make it more chaotic yeah my life's too easy and I'm not stressed enough yeah hi guys I've been
[9598.94 → 9605.18] living in Canada for almost two years coming from Brazil you guys thought me a lot about Canadian
[9605.18 → 9610.54] culture you taught me a lot about Canadian culture what in each of you or your three opinions is the
[9610.54 → 9617.66] unique Canadian thing man it's its a super Canadian thing to like not give an about your
[9617.66 → 9623.82] Canadianism I don't know if that's unique to us, but it's just it is instant it is so
[9625.58 → 9632.06] contrast with our southern neighbours that like you can like you can actually drive you know through a
[9632.06 → 9640.22] town in Canada and see Canadian flags like only on government buildings um that's the norm yeah we
[9640.22 → 9645.50] don't we don't do that changing a little bit, but it has actually changed quite a bit yeah um over the
[9645.50 → 9650.46] last of my house yeah we've never been patriotic, and now we are yeah it's very I wouldn't say we've
[9650.46 → 9656.54] never been patriotic I'd say in our adult lifetimes it's kind of faded to a significant degree that
[9656.54 → 9663.50] doesn't necessarily mean that um we don't value our sovereignty it just means that like I don't
[9663.50 → 9668.46] know I think we're just kind of chill about it, I feel like we see ourselves very much as members of
[9668.46 → 9675.66] the world instead or instead of uh aspirational members of the world because the reality of it is
[9675.66 → 9681.10] fair enough kind of not that relevant um there are a lot of the time but the like only reason why
[9681.10 → 9684.86] we're included a lot of stuff is because we were included in the big war that established a lot of
[9684.86 → 9690.22] stuff uh not because our economy is like strong, or we're particularly influential yep uh we built
[9690.22 → 9693.90] an arm for some cool thing that floats around the world that's pretty neat that's pretty cool um
[9694.94 → 9700.94] what was exactly the base question it's like unique unique Canadian thing for me, it's always
[9700.94 → 9706.94] been our one road yeah our one road that's pretty good yeah that's that South Park episode where they
[9706.94 → 9711.34] joke about the only road in Canada just follow the only road like that actually like is a thing that's
[9711.34 → 9717.58] true that's my favourite highway number one yeah we only have one is the one like federal
[9717.58 → 9723.18] highway that actually goes through every province um, and it doesn't even go through the territories so
[9723.18 → 9729.58] there are parts there are times when like a bridge along that road will fall into disrepair
[9730.06 → 9736.06] and to oh boy to get across Canada trucks and stuff will have to drive down into the states and
[9736.06 → 9741.74] cross support and then come back up part of it is also a ferry is it working yeah there 's's
[9741.74 → 9746.46] no way to get across it and part of it is actually a boat yeah have you ever taken a highway
[9746.46 → 9753.82] one boat I've heard of it but I haven't taken it yeah crazy yeah dumb country that's a good example um
[9756.06 → 9760.46] I don't know I think we're the only country in the world definitely not Tim Hortons is trash and owned
[9760.46 → 9764.78] by a Brazilian conglomerate I was just going to say I think we're the only country in the world that has a very
[9764.78 → 9771.82] strong argument for nationalizing a fast food chain yeah I think Canada needs to as a country needs to
[9771.82 → 9777.74] buy Tim Hortons and national and make it not suck again because it like uh it's actually sad I think
[9777.74 → 9783.66] it should like to offend our country that a thing that was genuinely a defining part of our country which
[9783.66 → 9790.70] it absolutely was it isn't anymore, but it absolutely was, and it sucks, and it's bad now and people still
[9790.70 → 9797.10] remember that and will come to Canada excited to try Tim Hortons and then be like hmm wow this is bad
[9797.10 → 9803.18] and Canada sucks and Canadians have no taste yes yeah those things actually get associated
[9803.18 → 9810.62] it's crazy it's uh it we as there maybe there's some other solution, but we should not have allowed it
[9810.62 → 9817.58] to become bad I think that's a uniquely Canadian thing is anytime a company gets big enough it can no
[9817.58 → 9822.70] longer be Canadian yeah by law it seems it's being listed on the Toronto stock exchange is like
[9823.58 → 9830.62] trash here and to not become good and being owned by basically you get so big that when it's
[9830.62 → 9837.26] time to sell no other Canadian entity can afford to buy you anymore so you just sell to an international
[9837.26 → 9842.94] conglomerate and then that's why the major companies in Canada are mostly internationally
[9842.94 → 9848.38] owned there are a handful of exceptions uh Shopify would be one but I don't know how long they're
[9848.38 → 9853.26] going to be hanging around yeah bombardier would be another one uh Hudson bay company yeah well rip
[9853.26 → 9854.14] Hudson bay company
[9857.90 → 9861.18] everyone in Canada has kind of known yeah rip ATI
[9862.78 → 9869.34] ATI yeah big side one well nor tel a little bit different of a rip but still yeah um
[9869.34 → 9875.26] um i I think everyone up here has known that Hudson's bay company was going away for a long
[9875.90 → 9880.62] oh yeah I mean I haven't set foot in one in my adult life that I can remember so long enough why would
[9880.62 → 9888.62] you I'm amazed I'm amazed they lasted as long as they did yep that's right I think the hub is Canadian
[9890.30 → 9894.86] what the hub yeah a major company I mean they're a major company you can't deny it oh
[9894.86 → 9900.86] yeah yeah they're Canadian that hub yeah yep oh north Vancouver I think it came up a lot recently
[9900.86 → 9908.94] about when you know when we were supporting Canadian companies yep uh wait what you're saying
[9908.94 → 9914.54] they're from north Vancouver no, no I thought they were back east that they are a and w their
[9914.54 → 9919.74] headquarters is in north Vancouver yeah oh yeah a and w Canada I got them confused so much I'm so sorry
[9919.74 → 9925.82] a completely different company from a and w USA I was desperate for food and I was in the states
[9925.82 → 9930.54] and I got a teen burger at a and w it was inedible it was completely disgusting yeah I would say that
[9930.54 → 9935.98] if you want to have Canadian fast food these days if you come to Canada, and you're like okay what's
[9935.98 → 9940.94] like good Canadian fast food go to a and w there isn't a lot yeah that's pretty much it that's pretty
[9940.94 → 9947.42] much it gets a Costco routine actually one of the best in Canada Costco counts yeah dead antisocial
[9947.42 → 9953.90] says the American a and w used to be good like 20 years ago yeah it's trash now it's so bad
[9955.50 → 9959.98] oh yeah triple o's triple o's is good Canadian fast food as well those are actually
[9959.98 → 9964.78] darn good burgers you might have a harder time finding them yeah they're nowhere near as common
[9964.78 → 9969.18] yeah it's western Canada so yeah that's why I didn't really bring them up, but that is a good point
[9969.18 → 9979.26] we'll give them that all right hit me Dan hi on I've and this is a speed type comment um my employer
[9979.26 → 9986.46] recently hit the big 100 what kind of achievements do you hope to have if leg lasts that long also
[9986.46 → 9990.62] hi had me well the achievements won't be mine personally because I'll be long dead
[9990.62 → 9995.98] so there's that um you're a tech YouTuber original people at the company would be
[9995.98 → 10001.18] gone yeah so i would hope that leg doesn't lose its soul I would hope that it's still a cool
[10001.18 → 10007.66] place to work um I would hope that you know we still have a culture of like kicking butt and working hard
[10008.22 → 10008.54] um
[10013.66 → 10020.30] I would hope that we do a good job of both competing hard in the tech media space but also
[10020.62 → 10025.66] um building a collaborative atmosphere and environment with our competitors
[10026.54 → 10028.62] um what else would be on the list
[10031.26 → 10034.46] I would kind of hope that they still haven't taken outside investment
[10035.98 → 10039.98] interesting how does that work though because there'd have to be succession of some sort
[10040.46 → 10043.10] do we go monarchy like what do you think in here
[10043.10 → 10052.14] what if they started buying up other companies ah man MNA is not really like
[10054.06 → 10059.10] my jam we've always been like uh grind it out and make it from the ground which honestly is kind
[10059.10 → 10066.78] of stupid to think about it, I don't know i i I don't know and I don't know how that works necessarily
[10066.78 → 10067.50] um
[10070.30 → 10077.58] I think the main thing is I wouldn't want like a conglomerate right yeah so at the very least maybe
[10077.58 → 10083.90] we could manage like a small ownership group I don't know I have no idea i i I can't claim to have
[10083.90 → 10090.14] the answer but I mean I guess i I'm going to have to figure out the answer at some point at some point
[10090.14 → 10100.14] because there's only so many exit strategies right like you can sell you can um you can convert to
[10100.14 → 10108.70] like uh like a co-op you can what else can you do you can shut down very popular one right now
[10108.70 → 10114.78] which is something that you like halted um which is your get a new CEO, and then you just retain all
[10114.78 → 10119.50] ownership and just take reports once a year and don't do anything with the won't help us hit 100 I'll
[10119.50 → 10125.98] die so someone's going to have to own the company at some point yeah but yeah you said exit strategy
[10125.98 → 10131.74] that is a thing oh sure sure sure I mean I meant like from ownership right um anyone else
[10131.74 → 10137.66] thinking uh oh yeah pass on to kids that's one so that's the monarchy route that's the monarchy
[10137.66 → 10146.06] route yep I don't know if any of your kids could be a paper my son asked to do a video
[10146.06 → 10153.58] and i gave him the least glamorous assignment possible to see if he actually cares and he
[10153.58 → 10161.02] appears to be working on a review of the new Kindle colour i really couldn't think of anything less
[10161.02 → 10166.46] glamorous that's pretty not glamorous than a Kindle e-reader yeah, but he is asking a lot of the right
[10166.46 → 10172.38] questions and I'm guiding him a little bit but I'm not doing any work for him, and it is a product
[10172.38 → 10178.70] that he genuinely uses like the old paper white um so i was planning on actually doing the video
[10178.70 → 10182.78] myself because i just wanted the new Kindle colour because it looked cool, and so i grabbed the new
[10182.78 → 10186.86] paper white and i grabbed the colour and i was like well I'll work on this in my spare time so i made
[10186.86 → 10191.34] some notes and i passed those along to him as well as giving him some ideas for where he could look for
[10191.34 → 10197.18] information other professional reviewers' customer reviews his own thoughts uh making sure not to
[10197.18 → 10205.74] plagiarize any of that and to compile it into you know his own thoughts and uh i told him that if he
[10205.74 → 10211.66] comes up with a script for it um that i would help him that i would help him review it and that he could
[10211.66 → 10219.74] host part of it um so hey who knows that's kind of cool we'll see i do you think it's go public
[10219.74 → 10224.22] was another exit strategy do you think it's something he's intrinsically interested in or
[10224.22 → 10227.98] do you think he's struggling to find things that are interested in and is doing a fairly classic
[10227.98 → 10234.54] manoeuvre of I'll do what dad does hard to say uh he definitely because i mean you have to remember the
[10234.54 → 10241.18] kid's young oh yeah he's young he might just be playing around like i which is totally fair i was way
[10242.22 → 10248.14] less driven to do anything when i was his age than he appears to be i mean i didn't try to do anything
[10248.14 → 10254.06] that my dad did even, yet he's got some of on yeah oh definitely yeah he's like the's the 50 50
[10254.86 → 10264.38] and then the next one is mine and the next one is Evans like we just kind of the uh the preschool
[10264.38 → 10271.42] teacher who had all of them so i think there's only one teacher no there's actually two now but before
[10271.42 → 10278.94] there was one teacher who got all of them for preschool and um about a week into my
[10278.94 → 10284.30] youngest's first term I'm dropping her off in the morning and she kind of goes she kind of pulls me
[10284.30 → 10297.26] says boy did you ever get a variety pack yes we did yes we did that was pretty funny uh okay I'm a dev i
[10297.26 → 10302.46] work on my own projects but i feel like I'm running out of time but I'm afraid about going live or
[10302.46 → 10312.86] selling how did you deal with anxiety of starting running and maintaining LTT niche just do it oh no
[10312.86 → 10321.10] never mind i thought you're making a running joke nope, nope just you just do it ship it we don't really
[10321.10 → 10331.74] uh spend much time in pre-production for anything uh that's not fair that's not fair I'm going to mute
[10331.74 → 10336.38] myself what do you mean that's not we do you guys spent a lot of time in pre-production for air table
[10337.82 → 10346.30] months that's a lot of time six yeah there boom boom he's got nothing i definitely have stuff
[10346.30 → 10351.74] you found it you can talk about whatever you want it's a free country it was one person
[10351.74 → 10357.02] reconstructing the entire communication and process system for the entire company
[10357.02 → 10362.54] six months was not enough it would have it could have either taken more time or more people but we
[10362.54 → 10367.74] hit a point we hit a point where it was like the value proposition of continuing to spend time on this
[10367.74 → 10375.42] doesn't really fit how you said time not man-hours objectively i am correct six months
[10375.42 → 10380.38] objectively man-hours is not the term anymore of time this is true, but you understood me and the
[10380.38 → 10382.30] point of language is mutual understanding
[10386.46 → 10391.98] CW does that's fair yeah oh they really do i think they're the only ones i mean they spent three
[10391.98 → 10396.78] years in pre-production of a screwdriver let's let's be real clearly we ain't rushing them
[10398.54 → 10403.50] uh all right, so the website is the worst i mean i think that you just gotta okay you don't
[10403.50 → 10408.30] want to do reputational damage by launching something that's not ready um you also have to
[10408.30 → 10413.34] just get stuff out there but you also yeah you have to ship is it usable yeah will it be useful for
[10413.34 → 10419.26] anyone will it be worth the asking price for anyone if the answer is yes then don't oversell it say what
[10419.26 → 10424.38] it is said who it's for and as you continue to refine it you can say what more it is and what more
[10424.38 → 10427.74] people it's for, and you can grow from there maybe i don't know what your product is so you want
[10427.74 → 10432.46] you want a big spike of inspiration get those first user tickets coming in yeah get it in front of
[10432.46 → 10437.66] people and see if people care at all because if they don't, that's good to know stop working on
[10437.66 → 10442.14] it stops wasting your time yeah but if they do, and they're like oh man this is cool doesn't really
[10442.14 → 10446.78] work because of x and y reasons, but it's cool then you can fix x and y reasons and then keep going
[10446.78 → 10452.38] what is the new term for man-hours the people hours human hours i think it's labour resource oh stop it
[10453.74 → 10459.98] i mean that's my favourite I've generally said people hours okay so what if a dog's working on it
[10459.98 → 10467.74] being hours that would be part of labour resource organism hours that's close but yeah
[10470.78 → 10473.18] feels like kind of a basic thing to call it though
[10476.46 → 10485.74] oh no nothing it was pretty good thanks work hours work that makes more sense the problem with
[10485.74 → 10492.62] work hours is a lot of people associate it with uh an individual yeah and DEI is illegal really say
[10492.62 → 10493.66] so it's man-hours now
[10496.70 → 10498.14] and they cost 30 percent more
[10499.90 → 10508.46] they're giving me 245 percent more oh, oh i like billable hours is pretty good, but it's
[10508.46 → 10515.42] generally in a contracting sense i like labour you don't generally AFA says if a dog's a Labrador it
[10515.42 → 10521.50] could be lab we'll hear it eventually and if a dog's a shih tzu it could be hours i mean oh i don't need
[10521.50 → 10526.46] to bleep that because it's a dog it's a dog it's not a sore word it's a dog and if you tell me i need
[10526.46 → 10535.26] to believe it that's poppycock i don't think most people are going to understand this it's like actually a
[10535.26 → 10541.82] word what poppycock isn't it well you act like they've never seen a tit mouse before or just a tit
[10544.70 → 10545.98] or a bony ass fish
[10549.66 → 10556.46] human capital thanks that's great too human capital is pretty good human labour resource suffering capital
[10558.46 → 10561.26] how many hours in the wage cage does this take
[10561.26 → 10562.70] you can't predict
[10562.70 → 10563.26] no
[10565.02 → 10566.46] the wage cage
[10568.30 → 10569.02] oh no
[10569.02 → 10569.66] i don't know
[10569.66 → 10573.82] your employer hasn't converted you to a salaried employee yet with no overtime
[10573.82 → 10580.22] no this is my corps training showing we took courses on abusing employees, and you can
[10580.22 → 10583.50] only be in a wage cage if you're getting an hourly wage he's he's getting
[10583.50 → 10589.26] you've been paying I'm hourly plenty of overtime oh no i know i meant you're not oh yeah yeah yeah
[10589.26 → 10595.10] yeah him I'm not paying for as of like three or four hours ago i think oh yeah whatever nice yeah i
[10595.10 → 10602.70] like on average work like 12 to 14 hours on Fridays alone yeah i didn't work a 13-hour day today just
[10602.70 → 10609.18] because of other reasons uh yeah that's what he's currently on that grind yeah oh boy it's fun i mean
[10609.18 → 10613.74] you guys do it why i think I've been had I ever gotten overtime i think I've been salaried
[10613.74 → 10622.78] forever did I uh hold on not realistic i don't know if it ever happened it wasn't real yeah
[10624.38 → 10629.74] yeah truthfully i don't know i don't think so i doubt it because who would have logged
[10629.74 → 10635.74] it yeah you should join a union probably the other thing is if you follow the standard rules
[10635.74 → 10642.78] here then you like context you wouldn't be allowed to work that time that Luke got cancelled
[10642.78 → 10648.46] instead of me let's go i there's a long story behind that don't worry about it
[10649.26 → 10655.26] uh should I explain it i can explain it i don't care i worked at one union job i just like that you're
[10655.26 → 10659.90] cancelled instead of me so honestly i don't think you should explain it i worked he's not going to let me
[10659.90 → 10666.54] know yeah i worked at one union job ever the job was fine the people i worked with at the plant was
[10666.54 → 10672.70] fine it was a bread factory uh my brother had worked there previously and a lot of the workers
[10672.70 → 10678.30] there that knew him were very cool with me, they liked my brother, but the union rep hated him
[10679.10 → 10685.10] hated him, so the union rep took it out on me, I can't imagine why anyone would ever get into it with
[10685.10 → 10696.06] your brother to be clear about leverage but I could imagine that I understand if it's almost like
[10696.06 → 10701.98] the cafetière boys have been a little hot-headed in common I was going to say I understand it because
[10701.98 → 10711.02] I understand it for me as well uh we are somewhat alike in that way uh but yeah, and he would take it
[10711.02 → 10716.94] out on me by just screwing with me with schedule um because the union rep set the schedule, and it was
[10716.94 → 10722.70] like a war and my actual boss man guy at work couldn't do anything about it, and it was super
[10722.70 → 10728.38] annoying Luke nuke the union buster I'm not a union buster at all my brother was in the teamsters union
[10728.38 → 10734.06] when he worked for the movies and that sounded and seemed pretty cool, and now he's in the firefighters
[10734.06 → 10740.14] union and the firefighters union is amazing yeah if you can get in yeah but there does appear to be
[10741.02 → 10746.94] some potentially union related factors that make it very difficult to get in that's also a problem
[10746.94 → 10752.78] there's that yes what Luke is trying to say is that they are not perfect no there's ups and downs and
[10752.78 → 10758.30] they have they there are points in history where like oh dear god if they didn't exist things would
[10758.30 → 10765.26] have been bad um, but they're not they're not always universally good anyway
[10765.26 → 10776.30] more why not hey Ltd first time buyer greetings from Mexico what's up what percentage
[10776.30 → 10780.54] of orders do you guys get from Latin American countries the last time I got one of your
[10780.54 → 10787.74] products was the original gangster screwdriver from Amazon nice that is a good question I do not know
[10787.74 → 10797.66] I can tell you that right now there are 155 visitors on the site there are at least three of them
[10798.62 → 10804.78] in America two in Brazil currently visiting you're talking about yeah, yeah on the site right now yeah
[10805.50 → 10812.46] um those are the Latin companies countries I am most familiar with uh no one else in anywhere in
[10812.46 → 10821.10] South America though um part of that's probably almost nothing in Europe right now but i
[10821.10 → 10825.66] think that's um quite time zone related because Europe and Australia usually light up pretty good
[10825.66 → 10829.18] when there's a lot of people on the site yeah they were earlier in the show yeah that makes sense
[10831.02 → 10839.74] yeah so I don't know uh based on a sample size of 150 a few oh one more in Brazil just now the little uh
[10839.74 → 10846.22] the little Shopify dashboard has a little like a little arrow that comes out from your location
[10846.22 → 10855.02] to the uh to the dot that it makes so if all you all in Brazil okay if all you all go to the site right now
[10855.02 → 10860.54] it'll be like pew pew pew to your location in Brazil so let's see how many Brazilians are watching
[10861.74 → 10864.30] how real time is this I think it's quite real time
[10864.30 → 10867.82] ill maker was there
[10872.78 → 10877.82] objectively annoying to everyone both sides of the aisle
[10880.78 → 10887.90] uh I mean the visitors going up right now is going to like yeah it's going up but I don't think
[10887.90 → 10892.86] any of them are in Brazil it's no it's its a bunch of north Americans it's oh there we go oh
[10892.86 → 10897.90] oh okay well I don't know the little animation only sometimes goes I don't know if you guys saw
[10897.90 → 10903.82] that, but it went to like somewhere in the eastern United States just now oh wait no, no no yeah there's
[10903.82 → 10908.70] more dots yeah there are more dots, but it didn't make the little pew thing, so there's like i
[10908.70 → 10912.46] don't know another like seven people see a bunch like down there yeah I see it oh yeah the
[10912.46 → 10916.70] dots also just getting darker there's also a bunch of people who seem confused that is not Brazil
[10916.70 → 10923.34] right there at the top there um that's Peru according to my risk map I don't know what
[10923.34 → 10928.46] it actually is confused well I told only the Brazilians oh yeah and some of these have hair
[10932.38 → 10942.22] okay I heard Dan like physically react to that i just nothing just ignore me evening
[10942.22 → 10949.98] whenever's question for Luke uh any updates on setting up the mainline I'll integration for the
[10949.98 → 10955.18] development team wouldn't the 100k server with its NVIDIA a100s be the perfect fit for this job
[10955.18 → 10961.74] we're just using those new macs I think they were just trying to get you to pressure me to buy a 100
[10961.74 → 10968.70] 000 server oh no we're just going to do that which would no we're not no, no we're not that would not
[10968.70 → 10973.26] have worked well however it could like it could have I don't even have to ask you if super micro
[10973.26 → 10979.18] wanted to like to sponsor something or whatever like to ask you lend us one what do you mean you don't
[10979.18 → 10983.74] have to ask me I thought I'll talk to tarot what is your approval limit I would talk to tarot no i
[10983.74 → 10987.82] think that's above his approval limit you have to go to the shareholders at a certain point does he
[10987.82 → 10994.62] have an approval a hundred thousand i I actually need to write this down if you do give me a number yeah
[10994.62 → 10999.50] because I'm working on that right now yeah there's like approval automations and stuff her are you just
[10999.50 → 11009.26] calling them tarot I don't mind bugging supposed to do meetings about this billable hours nice
[11009.26 → 11016.38] all right I know then he has to do time off in lieu hey uh you're live on the wan show again yeah
[11016.38 → 11024.94] yeah yeah it's every Friday um yeah you should probably know that if you like are the CEO of
[11024.94 → 11032.62] the company you have a have a call it's about the same thing too so it is really remember I called
[11032.62 → 11039.82] you before and I was asking about my approval limit uh for purchase requests um yeah yeah we were talking
[11039.82 → 11045.66] about that again what is your approval limit I was just talking to a vulnerable by yesterday so
[11045.66 → 11050.94] we didn't have to get out this week okay, but you don't actually know up until now he didn't have
[11050.94 → 11055.42] one I have it as an affinity I got in trouble I got in trouble that time when we're doing consumer
[11055.42 → 11061.82] research, and you weren't super happy about the amount of money I spent, so the words were I'm okay
[11061.82 → 11066.30] with the run rate spend anything else I'd like to be at least consulted even though you have discretion
[11066.30 → 11070.94] in terms of where you should spend money even though I might disagree that sounds like something I would
[11070.94 → 11075.82] say that sounds pretty reasonable okay and how much was that consumer research that um
[11079.26 → 11082.14] that's probably that's probably under NGA as we talked about earlier this week
[11082.70 → 11086.30] um so I prefer not to talk about this one on air just because I want to upset our partners
[11087.02 → 11090.06] that's fair that's good because I refuse to say it on the show before
[11090.94 → 11094.86] which is why he's trying to ask you now yeah I was going to say it but I had i legitimately just
[11094.86 → 11099.18] forgot how much it was so okay cool well it's a good thing you dodged that bullet make sure you let me
[11099.18 → 11103.98] know how much that how's that productive uh pretty good actually I think you're getting better at
[11103.98 → 11110.62] this yeah all right thanks Aaron all right have a good night guys all right later I'm amazed that
[11110.62 → 11113.90] they're actually going to have conversations about that this week this must have spurred some
[11114.70 → 11119.98] uh accounting conversations that's probably after talking to uh city okay well we'll have to get you
[11119.98 → 11124.70] guys an update on that what gets measured gets managed right yeah and then automate it so nobody ever
[11124.70 → 11130.22] has to think about it again yeah that's Luke's that's Luke's MO sick I've adopted that thinking
[11130.22 → 11138.54] is bad I hate doing thinking is terrible it's so none of us should ever think again hearty brain
[11139.66 → 11143.50] I want to draw pictures just before anyone freaks out because I feel like we can get cancelled for the
[11143.50 → 11148.62] second time in like 10 minutes no that's not the approach we're just trying to make it so that people
[11148.62 → 11152.78] don't have to think about like small meaningless things that don't matter I have spent six months
[11152.78 → 11157.34] thinking really hard so that I don't have to think for like five seconds yeah, but then you compound
[11157.34 → 11162.86] that across everyone in the company exactly yeah yeah um I was looking for budget laptops and found
[11162.86 → 11168.06] your video last month why did you break budget at the end when the idea originally felt like you were
[11168.06 → 11174.38] reviewing options for people that can't make enough I was looking for budget laptops why did you break
[11174.38 → 11179.58] budget at the end are you talking about the one where we looked at the top-selling laptops
[11179.58 → 11185.26] because we didn't have a budget on that one um we were just looking at the top-selling ones and the
[11185.26 → 11189.74] reason that we included the macBook was because it was one of the top-selling ones, and we thought it was
[11189.74 → 11197.02] fascinating that it was three or four times the price or whatever it was um, and we had you had
[11197.02 → 11202.70] to go to like the number 25th selling item to find a pc that was priced anywhere near it so we thought
[11202.70 → 11210.78] it was fascinating that pc buyers buy these crappy computers and then think that pcs kind
[11210.78 → 11217.66] of suck, but they're willing to spend a decent amount of money on a Mac on like a lot of money on a really
[11217.66 → 11222.38] nice mac, and then they're like oh max are good and i just thought that was an interesting conversation that
[11222.38 → 11233.34] was um yeah i don't I don't think it was a matter of like breaking budget we just wanted to
[11233.34 → 11238.22] talk about the top-selling the most popular laptops why they're the top-selling most popular
[11238.22 → 11242.06] laptops in the case of the pcs it was because they're cheap, and we thought it was fascinating that
[11242.06 → 11247.34] in the case of the mac it was for a different reason it was because of the brand value that apple has built
[11247.34 → 11260.14] by never building cheap crappy machines well at least not cheap ones anyway yeah mark my pc caught
[11260.14 → 11266.62] fire while gaming oh the power cord melted and arced until i got an extinguisher couldn't unplug due to
[11266.62 → 11272.86] the fire and arcing blocking the ups what causes a cord to melt after nine years power supply exhaust
[11272.86 → 11282.22] i would have to imagine the only thing i can think of would be a loose connection
[11283.66 → 11289.02] like if you had a loose connection that could heat up the housing and if the housing heated up and melted
[11289.02 → 11295.26] enough that those conductors could get close enough it could arc that's the only explanation
[11295.26 → 11300.86] that springs to mind for me but i am not an expert on this
[11302.86 → 11321.50] the conversation ended with us having paid way too much money it's having taken way too long and
[11322.14 → 11328.54] us basically saying uh look we still owe you a little bit of money not nearly enough for how much work you
[11328.54 → 11332.78] have outstanding, but we never want to speak to you again uh we are not giving you any more money and
[11332.78 → 11337.66] you are never coming here again uh we don't expect warranty coverage because quite frankly you'd probably
[11337.66 → 11343.50] break it more anyway goodbye sounds reasonable for how long that whole thing dragged out like
[11344.62 → 11349.10] i think that's probably the best they could have hoped for we could have sued them uh we decided that it
[11349.10 → 11355.98] was a waste of money and time, and we have better things to do um, but we would have quite easily gotten a
[11355.98 → 11362.46] settlement um because they did stuff that was just brazenly illegal in their billing and stuff
[11362.46 → 11363.74] stunning to be honest
[11366.14 → 11371.98] thanks for the great products i think Apple Silicon would make better Nintendo gaming devices than the
[11371.98 → 11378.86] switch 2. should apple buy Nintendo what do you think that would do to apple gaming wow i was with
[11378.86 → 11384.14] you there, and then you went you were on the rails, and you went i curated this one immediately
[11386.22 → 11392.46] no apple should not buy Nintendo i can't think of any two companies whose cultures are more different
[11392.46 → 11401.66] and yet reach such similar outcomes yeah uh Tim Mario the horseshoe problem they both are companies with
[11401.66 → 11408.78] like wild stocks of cash yeah stores of cash yeah stockpiles of cash um
[11412.22 → 11414.46] no, no apple should not buy Nintendo
[11415.90 → 11421.90] that would do nothing for apple gaming it would continue to be Nintendo gaming um and apple would
[11421.90 → 11426.54] continue not caring about gaming that's another thing apple would never buy Nintendo as for whether
[11426.54 → 11431.02] Apple Silicon would make a better Nintendo gaming device than the switch 2 i mean that's uh
[11432.22 → 11436.54] there might be an argument there i don't know i don't think so i don't think we've seen
[11437.42 → 11442.30] a like for like comparison between NVIDIA's latest GPUs and apples no it's also going to be not really
[11442.30 → 11447.18] because of DSS we really need to see the effects of yeah like it's the switch 2 is honestly
[11447.18 → 11449.82] going to be an incredibly interesting device to evaluate
[11449.82 → 11458.70] despite being not an incredibly interesting device I'm interested in i want one why are you so
[11458.70 → 11463.26] interested in though it's like the least it's the switch but like better yeah which is not interesting
[11463.26 → 11468.38] but it's everything that it is less crappy stuff being less crappy is pretty interesting to me in
[11468.38 → 11476.94] current year oh i feel that hard that hurts that hurt my soul a little bit oh god oh he's so right
[11476.94 → 11484.38] we're coming out of six GPU embargoes and this is what we get is he wrong though
[11484.38 → 11489.66] we talked earlier on the show about how exciting it was that you could walk into a store and buy a GPU
[11489.66 → 11497.82] for over MSRP for ten dollars over MSRP it's only ten dollars over price oh my goodness i hate current
[11497.82 → 11513.42] year i say that so much i want to go home no okay let's just keep going hello LTT I'm curious about
[11513.42 → 11520.22] your swear policy what would you classify as quote unquote bleepable i sometimes hear you hear your
[11520.22 → 11526.46] stream and videos say things i thought would have been bleeped out but are pretty frequent i mean mistakes
[11526.46 → 11534.78] yeah sometimes we just you know pull a boner um and we accidentally don't bleep something that
[11535.42 → 11542.22] probably should have been bleeped um also the like the rules around swearing are
[11543.42 → 11550.62] sort of nebulous and complicated like South Park did a hilarious episode it hits the fan where they
[11550.62 → 11560.14] um sort of poked fun at censorship rules um and like how it was you know depending on the usage
[11560.14 → 11567.26] of the word which we generally do bleep regardless of the usage it was like okay that's weird with the
[11567.26 → 11574.14] censors or it wasn't uh depending on whether it was like used as an adjective or uh i forget the
[11574.14 → 11579.90] exact reasons but Mr garrison like stands on the at the board and sort of explains what you are and what
[11579.90 → 11587.82] you're not allowed to say um it's also evolved over time actually like uh i and it's, and it's region
[11587.82 → 11597.58] specific too like for example over here uh is generally considered to be like probably bleepable but
[11597.58 → 11606.78] maybe not um and then like dick is like some people are like oh my god i can't believe i can't believe
[11606.78 → 11612.46] you didn't bleep dick whereas i just kind of I'm like because i just think it's funnier but yeah no
[11612.46 → 11620.22] one cares here no one cares, so yeah someone in chat said Ozzy's in the c word yeah yeah yeah like oh the
[11620.22 → 11627.34] c word's like it's a big deal no, no up here yeah i don't even say it like off camera
[11627.34 → 11634.86] no yeah, and then it's yeah conversation down there it's just it's just a different like
[11635.82 → 11642.22] societies will determine it's all just noises we make with our face uh societies will determine
[11642.22 → 11646.94] which ones are cool and which ones aren't yeah so i mean you know for us, I'd say you know the things that
[11647.66 → 11654.70] we don't use at all whether the camera's rolling or not you know you've got your n-word right um things
[11654.70 → 11662.46] that we use and bleep you know that's your like your, and you know, and you know that sort of thing
[11662.46 → 11666.62] and things that we just kind of let slide is like you're being a real ass about the situation
[11667.34 → 11675.02] um damn it uh if you add hole to the end of it, it becomes worse and i think yeah that is bleeped on TV
[11675.02 → 11681.02] but just the front section is not but if you say them together that's terrible yeah that's interesting
[11681.02 → 11688.94] i think that's our current censorship laws i can't quite remember oh yes chat that's why i smiled j
[11688.94 → 11694.70] j christ08 says bollocks and wankers would probably never be on British TV but here it's hilarious oh yeah
[11694.70 → 11700.06] i think those are because we just think it's like funny because bollocks because it sounds so British or
[11700.06 → 11707.02] whatever yeah yeah definitely you swear and like i wouldn't care at all if it was in my non-native tongue
[11707.02 → 11714.38] so like uh like tabernacle you know like that's a French word who cares right um all right carry on
[11716.86 → 11724.94] let's see LDL fixed my son's RC car resoldering parts on the board he watched and got the spark in
[11724.94 → 11731.42] quotes of wanting to learn Linus what is a dad moment where you saw that your kids have that childlike
[11731.42 → 11737.26] curiosity oh it's been really cool watching the girls um get really into the 3d printer i think um
[11737.90 → 11744.38] they like all of a sudden wanted to like sign up for lessons and like learn computer stuff um
[11745.42 → 11750.78] before that they mostly were just like used it as a gaming box so that was pretty cool
[11750.78 → 11762.78] watching little man be not just genuinely deeply curious but actually like have good
[11762.78 → 11767.74] questions and seem to like care and want to learn more and get more out of it oh yeah we attended a
[11767.74 → 11773.34] tour together are we allowed to say where we toured yeah okay we went to NASA yeah um Luke arranged
[11773.34 → 11781.74] everything and um i I asked my son because like usually I don't really do vacation um like I don't
[11781.74 → 11786.30] go anywhere like when I get time off the thing that I'd rather do more than anything else in the world
[11786.30 → 11793.42] is just sit um and do nothing and think about nothing uh but in this case Luke invited me out of as a
[11793.42 → 11797.02] courtesy even though he knew I probably wasn't going to go and I was like oh that would probably be
[11797.02 → 11800.54] fascinating for my son the girls are still a little young for that I think it would have been a
[11800.54 → 11804.62] lot for them and I especially think that now that it's done because it was a lot of walking and a
[11804.62 → 11814.86] lot of knowledge dumps um, but he had an absolute blast and um pun intended and asked some I thought
[11814.86 → 11820.46] some really salient questions which was surprising to me, it demonstrated he was really paying attention
[11820.46 → 11825.82] and thinking about it and uh you know given how shy he was when he was very, very little it was cool to
[11825.82 → 11829.66] see him speak up in a group setting so yeah lots of moments I mean as a parent
[11830.70 → 11835.98] they're going to come constantly there was a bit of trust there too because like uh it's not generally
[11835.98 → 11841.42] a tour you bring kids on like you're not generally necessarily allowed because there are areas you're
[11841.42 → 11849.50] going to that are like they're not kid friendly no if you horse around it's like a problem yeah um like
[11849.50 → 11855.10] for other people too like it's a safety concern yeah but there was some trust there and he
[11855.10 → 11859.18] was totally good the whole time oh yeah he's a great kid unflinchingly good which was great
[11859.18 → 11869.26] yep are there any new sticker sets coming yes I've bought a case which has three fans in the front
[11869.26 → 11875.02] behind an acrylic panel with zero airflow any suggestions on how to approve uh mesh so I have
[11875.02 → 11879.26] something in front and avoid limbs getting stuck if I cut it I can't believe the timing of this okay
[11879.26 → 11883.90] so first you can cut a hole, and then you can drill some holes, and then you can buy a little mesh
[11883.90 → 11887.58] fan filters but that's not actually what I want to talk about what I want to talk about is
[11887.58 → 11895.02] that we're collabing with NASA to answer the question of how far does a fan need to be from a
[11895.02 → 11901.18] panel to work effectively cool, and they've got like the science for if it's going to be really cool that's
[11901.18 → 11905.26] awesome yeah i I was talking to Adam about it today I'm like super excited that's sweet that's going to be
[11905.26 → 11910.38] freaking awesome because there are so many applications where you want to know that like how high does your
[11910.38 → 11914.54] computer case have to be off the floor before that power supply fan's not effective yeah yeah what
[11914.54 → 11918.46] about if you have a vertical GPU mount how close does it have to be from the side panel before those
[11918.46 → 11923.82] fans are really impeded also the front fans and I think I came up with one other scenario so yeah
[11923.82 → 11931.50] it's going to be awesome sounds sick actually hey dynastukenlan how do you draw the line on how much
[11931.50 → 11938.22] internal information to show I feel like your transparency bites you in the ass more uh often than it helps you
[11938.22 → 11946.22] for me a big part of my problem is that I am not detail oriented enough to lie even if I wanted to
[11949.18 → 11957.58] honesty by incompetency it really is the best policy to tell the truth and to
[11959.18 → 11966.78] and to so much more legit than people understand that's why we love him and to apply
[11966.78 → 11974.62] to apply a basic set of principles in a way that is consistent can be consistently
[11975.26 → 11984.14] remembered and applied and accounted for um and by saying things publicly I create a system where
[11984.14 → 11990.78] that accountability is inherent because once you say something publicly you are in my humble opinion
[11990.78 → 11997.98] bound to it so a lot of the time I share this internal information that ends up biting me in the
[11997.98 → 12006.62] butt because in a certain sense i kind of want it to if is I ever changed my story in the future
[12007.34 → 12012.70] if that kind of makes sense there are ways that it has bitten me in the butt that I haven't wanted it to
[12012.70 → 12019.18] like when people make assumptions like that i you know did lie or something when actually I just like
[12019.18 → 12023.82] told you guys what it was and I don't know you drew your own conclusions because you got like mental
[12023.82 → 12028.62] problems or something um I thought you were just collecting ass bite marks like trophies or
[12028.62 → 12037.74] achievements or something you want to see them they match the tattoo and like i I don't know my tattoo is just
[12037.74 → 12041.50] his my other tattoo is twinning
[12045.02 → 12053.10] sometimes I can be logical to a fault but also highly emotional if that makes sense and so that
[12053.10 → 12063.02] logicalness in terms of my course of action um I think both the logical and emotional side of me
[12063.02 → 12069.26] think that if I behave in a way that is logical that that should make sense to other people and that
[12069.26 → 12076.30] they should more clearly be able to assess my motivations and predict my future actions so you
[12076.30 → 12082.14] know to me for something like the trust me bro warranty let's look at that the logical case that I laid out
[12082.14 → 12093.10] pretty clearly is that if i ever it up I would get put up on a stake right and then and then spit roasted
[12093.10 → 12099.42] over a fire right because I'm a public figure so if I were to your know go around screwing people over
[12099.42 → 12105.58] on the warranty coverage of their products they would, it would make the loudest possible noise and be the
[12105.58 → 12112.54] the juiciest possible gossip and so to me that made the logical part the logical bar in my brain went so
[12112.54 → 12118.62] this should be pretty obvious that i as not an idiot would not screw this up because it would basically
[12118.62 → 12127.58] be the end of my career um but then like I don't know I guess the I guess some part of me missed the
[12127.58 → 12133.26] part where other people just like do stuff anyway that they shouldn't and don't seem to face consequences
[12133.26 → 12137.42] and people have lived through that over and over and over again so that trust is eroded on
[12137.42 → 12145.26] a broader scale which has nothing to do with me and um you know that's something that like doesn't
[12145.26 → 12151.18] easily compute for me uh it's something that I struggle with it also
[12156.30 → 12162.06] emotionally is really frustrating right because um you know to me something can be kind of black and
[12162.06 → 12166.62] white it's like yeah no obviously we wouldn't do that because that would be really dumb uh but
[12166.62 → 12171.34] some people legitimately seem to think that I'm actually very dumb, and so they will tend to assume
[12171.34 → 12177.82] like the dumbest possible course of action even though i I don't really think I've you know given
[12177.82 → 12183.82] any reason I don't think that's necessarily fair oh there's definitely some yes okay sure but i
[12183.82 → 12188.46] don't think as a whole that's necessarily fair no I bet you with a lot of people they're going with the
[12188.46 → 12192.86] route that we've told them to do whether they've seen that or not I don't know, but it's the don't
[12192.86 → 12200.14] trust companies thing I think sometimes you overestimate how many people watch enough to feel
[12200.14 → 12205.10] like they know you and there's also cultural differences like one of the one of the big things
[12205.10 → 12210.62] that I saw with the whole warranty thing was places where they have strong consumer protection laws and
[12210.62 → 12217.98] strong mechanisms to hold companies accountable for their warranty policies right here we don't have that
[12217.98 → 12224.54] yeah no you literally have to like to take the company to court yeah at a great deal of personal
[12224.54 → 12231.42] time and expense you won't it pretty much boils down to the company's willingness to do anything for
[12231.42 → 12237.66] you um but there are parts of the world where that is different and some of those people were
[12237.66 → 12246.94] legitimately very upset in like a personal value way that I would see it any way other than that um
[12247.98 → 12254.14] okay i you know that's fair enough right, and you know obviously we went in, and we like created a
[12254.14 → 12259.50] policy before we actually ever sold a backpack, but you know for some reason like that's still
[12260.14 → 12266.06] you know a huge problem even though the conversation people on that the poorly worded
[12266.06 → 12270.46] explanation that I gave for why we didn't have a policy yet which by the way was still before we
[12270.46 → 12277.34] ever sold a backpack that's that part is very often forgotten very often forgotten um that was
[12277.34 → 12282.22] the truth and that transparency bit me in the butt big time because i didn't do a good job of explaining
[12282.22 → 12286.46] it and wasn't well packaged no it was extremely poorly packaged and
[12289.58 → 12297.34] I'm going to keep doing it in conclusion which is based we have uh we have an interview coming up on
[12297.34 → 12303.98] float plane um checking in on Taryn's first two years so that's cool Sammy sat down with me and
[12303.98 → 12314.14] Taryn and asked us some questions and um we are unflinching in our responses and uh you know we touch on
[12314.14 → 12320.78] some potentially even challenging and uncomfortable subjects um and i think it's going to be really
[12320.78 → 12325.34] great for the community even if it know airs our internal laundry a little bit more than
[12325.34 → 12329.90] most companies would but i think that's part of what makes us really special i feel like the watch
[12329.90 → 12334.78] rate percentage for that video of internal employees i mean well the amount of people
[12334.78 → 12343.10] that watch that with the Linus account alone oh yeah that's going to be nuts I'll watch it is genuinely
[12343.10 → 12347.90] sounds fascinating i asked him why he hasn't moved here yet
[12347.90 → 12354.30] but i don't really ask him so much as i point it pointed out yeah
[12356.94 → 12362.94] because Tim Hortons is bad i don't yeah i don't blame him we need to fix it is has to be fixed i know
[12362.94 → 12366.78] it has to be fixed you can't afford to buy it we can't afford to buy you could buy if it's worth
[12366.78 → 12371.34] billions of dollars start a new one just take our own love you literally know how much money i have
[12371.34 → 12379.50] what are you even talking about what if you made what if you made Linus Sebastian's
[12381.34 → 12387.26] it's a terrible name for a restaurant really is a terrible name oh no call it
[12387.26 → 12394.06] oh he's got time for Linus Sebastian's that's not the worst it jingled fairly well, well yeah that's
[12394.06 → 12404.38] a Tim Hortons jingle i know okay yeah all right let's carry on Sebastian's has you Lenny sees
[12404.38 → 12410.86] we've got that's that's a scary Sebastian's is not that bad Sebastian's has you yeah they have you
[12410.86 → 12422.06] bro it's creepy trust them trust us it's fresh trust us minus and loops is not bad actually hey i like it
[12422.06 → 12428.70] it'll's coffee bar yeah oh we could have like a could have like a chilled juice bar we could call
[12428.70 → 12442.30] it'll cool j's that was quick my goodness okay got a couple more for you here to buying a backpack for
[12442.30 → 12449.26] my GF uh are there any of the fun colours for the screwdriver Noctua retro coming back also Luke as a
[12449.26 → 12454.54] gym rat what's your favourite lift and PR oh dude this guy sounds like a pro uh i don't PR because
[12454.54 → 12461.90] I'm old and broken so i you do it a special PR my five yeah i do my i do minimum sets of five my
[12461.90 → 12469.50] best for that's 225 benches probably but uh no that's the one I'm most proud of like grinding out but
[12469.50 → 12475.82] probably my relative best was like a long time ago and i haven't pushed it in a minute, but there was a
[12475.82 → 12481.74] there's a point in time that for work reasons i had a lot of pent-up uh feels, and my dad was also
[12481.74 → 12488.38] there and that pushes me to try really hard and not that far into my fitness journey i hit uh 335
[12488.38 → 12495.10] squat for five or six and the bar was bouncing i scared one of the ladies in the gym because i work
[12495.10 → 12500.06] at a community gym and not a big lifter gym big lifter gym nobody would have cared at all um, but she was
[12500.06 → 12505.98] like the bar's going to break and i was like no it's fine um, but that was a very cool moment um that has
[12505.98 → 12512.70] to feel perfect that was amazing i wish you could frame moments it was fantastic uh it's so
[12512.70 → 12519.18] ego boosting and then i had to remember that like it's not like an incredible amount but anyway um
[12519.82 → 12525.50] my favourite one's probably uh i think they're called eccentric accentuated skull crashers I'm sure
[12525.50 → 12529.66] you remember this oh those are still my favourite too after i figured out after i figured out the
[12529.66 → 12536.62] muscle brain to do them it's so satisfying but you lay flat down on a bench you take a fixed bar
[12536.62 → 12541.66] I've done it with barbells now because those the fixed bars are too low yeah look got too strong i
[12541.66 → 12549.90] need the weenie hut junior bars um but you go arm straight up and then slightly back so that your
[12549.90 → 12555.34] your return position or your resting position is still loaded, and then you have to come down for three
[12555.34 → 12560.70] seconds to behind your head is generally where i go and then fire up, and you have to do that for 12
[12560.70 → 12568.70] times, and it feels great your triceps just after you figure out that the motion is throwing the bar
[12568.70 → 12575.58] over you yeah it feels so good it feels so good it feels very functional it's weird it's great to try
[12575.58 → 12583.02] them it's very good let's have an end justify the means conversation real quick okay Denali 444 says
[12583.02 → 12592.14] buy Tim Hortons just rip us off with a meme coin and use that to finance if it's 2025 make Canada
[12592.14 → 12597.90] great again coin would that justify a rug pull if we bought Tim Hortons back for Canada the purpose of
[12597.90 → 12603.66] the rug pull is by is buying Tim Hortons we're gonna we're not coin we did for the screwdriver what
[12603.66 → 12611.42] we're going to do for Canada's fast food it's going to be the best it'll be a 9.5 we're going to do what they
[12611.42 → 12612.46] did to this donut
[12616.22 → 12620.06] with the flush driver but at least you'll have good donuts and coffee at the end of it
[12621.18 → 12625.98] they'll actually make the donuts in store again all right sorry as for the uh as for the other fun
[12625.98 → 12632.22] colours of the screwdriver my goal in the long term is that you can configure your screwdriver like Xbox
[12632.22 → 12638.70] controllers and get any colour combination you want, but we are really far away from that right now and
[12638.70 → 12646.14] any movement that we make towards diversifying our um our distribution centres to make it easier to
[12646.14 → 12651.50] address other parts of the world if it gets more challenging to sell into the US is going to set back
[12651.50 → 12655.26] projects like that because there'd have to be a whole setup, and you'd have to have inventory of all
[12655.26 → 12661.10] these different colours and stuff be a real challenge okay last one I've got for you tonight i have a
[12661.10 → 12669.02] question for one and a half of the Rainier boys just one half oh for one half of the Rainier boys
[12669.02 → 12676.86] there my eyes are going now our I'm not one of them our company's dev teams don't have access to prod
[12676.86 → 12680.70] and are forced to do everything in testing environments is this normal in the dev world
[12680.70 → 12687.98] to pee again uh it kind of depends on your company's size curate this one no wait yes okay i forgot i
[12687.98 → 12695.26] didn't think i did but i now i think that's okay um no so like at our comp yeah it most companies' no
[12695.26 → 12702.22] most companies you'll have a select group of people that have access to it and updates have to go
[12702.22 → 12709.02] through them, it is not very super normal especially at sizeable teams or non-startups or teams that are
[12709.02 → 12715.26] actually properly in production for just everybody be able to directly access prod um and i don't think
[12715.26 → 12720.86] you should take that as an insult i think you should take that as like a hooray i don't have this
[12722.06 → 12730.54] soul-crushing level of responsibility uh of security it took me like what it may be a year and a half
[12730.54 → 12737.18] maybe more before i was able to access the like Sancho prod stuff that i do before the show because
[12737.18 → 12742.94] that's a horrific amount of responsibility yeah yeah, and it's, and it's not it's not for me to just
[12742.94 → 12747.98] make an oops i think Dan is going to screw up so he can't access the thing the biggest part of it is
[12747.98 → 12754.62] actually like oh what if Dan's account gets compromised or if i just make a mistake oh or that
[12754.62 → 12760.46] yeah more people to just accidentally miss some rigour behind your understanding of the process
[12760.46 → 12765.50] and how things work because that's a that's a touchy the same to a touchy dashboard all the same
[12767.10 → 12772.30] and there's really no confirmation no there's really not a lot of stopping you from making pretty
[12772.30 → 12779.26] big mistakes um so yeah i don't know its no i wouldn't say it's super normal unless you have a
[12779.26 → 12785.98] very small team um and like you know some of my teams are in that range uh so some of my teams basically
[12785.98 → 12791.26] everyone can touch broad uh, but there's still usually process involved uh to make sure that
[12791.26 → 12796.78] there's visibility on it stuff like that um but i don't think the goal should be for everyone to be
[12796.78 → 12802.70] able to touch broad um i know there was one conversation i was near at one point in time
[12802.70 → 12807.34] where two people at a certain company were bickering back and forth and the one of one of them used
[12807.34 → 12813.10] there I'm able to push things to prod as like a as a card to play against the other and that
[12813.10 → 12818.30] felt icky but um I do still think it's generally a better idea to have these updates filter through
[12818.30 → 12822.62] a smaller group of people so that pushes to prod can be controlled should also be a cultural thing
[12822.62 → 12829.02] where you don't want to have access to prod yeah because then there's pressure yeah yeah liability
[12829.02 → 12835.42] yeah yes and that be that liability and managing that liability ends up being a significant part
[12835.42 → 12839.74] of those people's jobs because now they're like reviewing everything that's going up and making
[12839.74 → 12844.14] sure it's good and blah blah blah blah and that's that's like what they do now um and if you just want
[12844.14 → 12853.98] to build things uh it might not be the best way to do that anyway I think we're good see you again next
[12853.98 → 12861.82] week same bad time same bad channel I can't even press it mine is this button you have to bye
[12866.62 → 12868.62] what
