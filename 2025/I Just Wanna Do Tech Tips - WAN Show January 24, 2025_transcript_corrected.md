[0.32 → 2.32] Good evening everyone!
[2.92 → 7.60] My plan was to not discuss the whole situation right now any further.
[7.60 → 10.88] Like many of you, we wanted to keep this whole thing from dragging out.
[10.88 → 16.36] So we set our piece, Steve from Gamers Nexus wrote a manifesto that could probably be best summed up as,
[16.36 → 20.60] No U, and then it was done. Or so we thought.
[21.32 → 26.40] Shortly before WAN show, Louis Grossman released an hour-long hit piece, and in a now-deleted comment,
[26.40 → 29.52] Steve mentioned he had seen the video before it went live, making it clear that
[29.52 → 33.92] at the very least he was involved in reviewing this video before publication.
[37.36 → 42.96] When other creators reached out to us in support, we explicitly discouraged any escalation,
[42.96 → 45.20] while Steve seems to be doing the opposite.
[45.20 → 50.72] So here we are, more or less forced to respond yet again, but we'll keep it much, much shorter this time.
[51.60 → 57.92] Steve asked me to direct any further communications about his ethical breach and persistent defamatory statements to his lawyer.
[57.92 → 64.32] As I clearly stated before, I don't have a lawyer involved, and I don't want one involved.
[64.32 → 70.24] I wrote last week's address myself with feedback from my team, and this much shorter wrap-up will come from me as well.
[70.24 → 73.36] The core issue has not been addressed at all.
[73.36 → 77.76] Because of ethical and process errors, Steve published false and damaging information about a competitor.
[77.76 → 88.08] Right of reply matters, both because it is essential for accurate reporting, and because scandal travels much faster and is a lot stickier in people's minds than the
[88.64 → 91.76] oh, oops, never mind, that comes out when the allegations are found to be false.
[91.76 → 95.76] There's actually a good thread on the Subreddit that you guys can check out.
[95.76 → 99.84] That is not the visual for it, but that's fine.
[99.84 → 103.20] The point is that this is so much worse now.
[103.20 → 108.64] Faced with the unavoidable fact that he got it wrong and caused a bunch of damage with his actions,
[108.64 → 113.76] Steve has outright refused to apologize, correct, or retract any of his false statements.
[114.40 → 116.24] That's next level, man.
[116.24 → 123.52] I am extremely grateful that so many of you are seeing how misrepresentative the original reporting was,
[124.24 → 126.80] both around the Billet Lab situation and around the honey thing.
[128.16 → 133.04] I want to applaud the maturity of the folks, many, many folks, who have come out and said,
[133.04 → 137.12] hey, I'm sorry that I raised a pitchfork while I didn't have the full story.
[138.32 → 142.16] I'm still deeply saddened by the virality of Steve's first video.
[142.16 → 147.52] Because of that, many will never hear the truth, a fact that is worsened by Steve's
[147.52 → 151.20] ongoing refusal to issue any corrections or retractions in spite of the fact that his
[151.20 → 154.80] reporting on me contains clear objective errors and misquotes.
[154.80 → 158.48] So in summary, Steve's response shows that his standards for himself fall
[158.48 → 160.72] far short of the standards he holds others to.
[160.72 → 168.32] And look, look, dude, stealthily removing the word journalism from the GN Patreon changes nothing.
[168.32 → 171.76] This whole thing is getting, quite frankly, kind of pathetic.
[172.96 → 180.08] Even my, and I quote, terrible response to the original hit piece acknowledged issues on our side,
[180.08 → 183.92] laid out a path forward, which we have taken, I'm so proud of our team,
[183.92 → 189.60] and it included words like, no excuses, I need to own the mistakes, and sorry.
[190.64 → 195.12] Steve's response contained no such introspection and no better path forward.
[195.12 → 201.12] His mask is now truly off for anyone who used to appreciate him for his ethics and objectivity.
[201.12 → 203.68] As it turns out, he only cares about those things when it's convenient.
[204.56 → 209.04] On that note, just because somebody's running a masterclass in deflection and misdirection,
[209.04 → 211.36] that doesn't mean that absolutely everything they say is wrong.
[211.36 → 215.36] So the last thing I'm going to do today is what you guys rightly expect of me.
[215.36 → 217.52] I will meet my faults and my errors head on.
[217.52 → 224.00] I'm sorry that I used unprofessional language, and if I ever said this, truthfully I don't recall it,
[224.00 → 226.88] but if I did, I take that back 100%.
[227.44 → 228.88] I'm sorry, and I will work to do better.
[230.08 → 230.88] So where do we go now?
[232.48 → 233.52] I don't know, guys.
[233.52 → 238.00] I see your calls to end the drama, but I can only control my side in this.
[238.80 → 241.60] My team and I have issued corrections and retractions where needed.
[241.60 → 243.44] We will continue to do so.
[244.64 → 246.80] There's a couple fixes that we need for the 5090 video.
[246.80 → 247.76] They're pinned under the video.
[247.76 → 248.96] We're getting all of that sorted.
[249.84 → 255.28] Meanwhile, the other side is spitting on our olive branch, layering up, publicly attacking my credibility
[255.28 → 261.60] with no indication that it will end, and now seemingly colluding with other creators to smear me in public.
[262.88 → 265.12] I don't want to play this stupid game anymore.
[265.52 → 267.44] There are only stupid prizes to be won.
[267.44 → 270.48] So, yeah, I think I've said enough for now.
[270.48 → 272.24] Obviously, I'm aware of Grossman's video.
[272.24 → 275.36] We alluded to it earlier, and I have some idea what it's about.
[275.36 → 280.08] In the lead up, he was corresponding with me, but I don't think now is the time for that.
[280.08 → 284.16] Right now is the time to hang out with awesome people who matter, and that's you guys.
[285.20 → 286.96] Welcome to the WAN show, everyone.
[286.96 → 289.52] We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[290.24 → 298.08] Some game makers hope that Grand Theft Auto VI will cost up to 100 US dollars at launch.
[298.08 → 307.36] And, oh man, if we want to shout out creators who are doing awesome work, and make sure we're getting some views for guys that are just incredible good people,
[307.84 → 314.16] Nitwit slash Kyle, his CES 2025 coverage is up, so I want you guys to go check that out.
[314.16 → 318.48] He's kind of had a pretty rough couple of weeks, to say the least.
[318.48 → 320.00] What else we got this week, sir?
[320.00 → 322.40] Wow, I had time again to prep topics.
[323.04 → 328.56] A student built an open source laptop in six months, and it's actually really, really cool.
[329.60 → 330.64] The video's awesome.
[330.64 → 331.76] We've talked about...
[331.76 → 332.72] Sorry, sorry, I'll save it.
[332.72 → 333.28] I'll save it.
[333.28 → 334.48] And GPU news!
[336.24 → 338.96] Something huge happened this week, and it was a graphics card.
[338.96 → 340.56] Yeah, why don't we talk about that?
[341.84 → 342.32] Please.
[342.32 → 344.32] Please.
[361.04 → 365.28] The show is brought to you today by Squarespace, Notion, and Oh Snap,
[365.28 → 369.60] along with our rap partner, Brand, and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[370.24 → 371.84] Why don't we jump right into...
[372.80 → 373.20] Ooh.
[373.84 → 376.16] How about student builds open source laptop in six months?
[376.16 → 376.72] I like it.
[376.72 → 378.40] This is actually the coolest thing.
[378.40 → 379.44] Why don't you run us through it?
[379.44 → 386.40] Because you might think, okay, you might think, hearing that, like, oh yeah, but like, it probably sucks.
[386.40 → 386.80] No.
[386.80 → 388.80] What if I told you it didn't?
[388.80 → 389.44] It's pretty sick.
[389.44 → 390.64] Okay, okay, go, go, go.
[390.64 → 394.16] So I'm probably going to butcher the name, but it's...
[395.12 → 396.64] Anion, I think?
[396.64 → 399.20] It's A-N-Y-O-N underscore E.
[400.56 → 402.80] The specs are a 4K AMOLED display.
[402.80 → 404.08] Didn't skimp there at all.
[404.08 → 405.04] Sure.
[405.04 → 407.76] The second I saw that, I was like, oh, we're serious.
[407.76 → 408.00] Okay.
[408.00 → 408.24] Sure.
[408.24 → 408.64] Sure.
[408.64 → 410.24] 16 gigs of DDR4 RAM.
[410.24 → 419.20] An RK3588 SoC, which has an eight-core ARM processor with GPU and NPU, which he points out in the video.
[419.20 → 421.44] An M.2 SSD of some capacity.
[421.44 → 422.24] Wi-Fi 6.
[422.24 → 427.68] A 62.9 watt-hour battery, which came out to about seven hours of battery life.
[427.68 → 428.32] Sick.
[428.32 → 431.04] Brian Huang, hope I said that right, sorry.
[431.04 → 439.44] A senior in high school, mind completely blown, made an open source laptop from scratch he called the Neon.
[439.44 → 440.24] I think it's Neon.
[440.88 → 444.56] I originally read it and thought it was anyone, but then in the video I think he says Neon.
[444.56 → 445.60] Because...
[445.60 → 449.12] Whatever, I'm just going to call it the super cool laptop that I can't believe a high school student made.
[449.12 → 449.52] It's so sick.
[449.52 → 450.32] How about that?
[450.32 → 454.40] We're not going to show the video here because you need to go watch it, but we'll talk about it a little bit.
[454.40 → 456.64] And Dan will link it in the chat for you guys.
[456.64 → 457.12] Yeah.
[457.12 → 462.08] Uh, because AMD and Intel don't just give you, you know, CPUs and documentation.
[462.08 → 464.32] He instead went with that rock chip processor.
[464.32 → 470.16] And honestly, where he like really hooked me in the video was diving through the specs of that processor
[470.16 → 472.48] and why he wanted it and things he's going to do for it and stuff.
[472.48 → 473.68] Very, very cool.
[473.68 → 478.48] Um, a very expensive and complicated part of building a laptop are the IO interconnects.
[478.48 → 485.76] So Brian went with the FriendlyElec SOME which helps, which has heaps of IO on board.
[485.76 → 489.28] Uh, we actually used the same board to make a DIY NAS last year.
[489.28 → 490.48] Uh, the next problem...
[490.48 → 491.84] Oh yeah, that thing is so cool.
[491.84 → 492.24] Yeah.
[492.24 → 493.20] Like so cool.
[493.20 → 494.00] Yeah.
[494.00 → 495.76] The next problem was the display.
[495.76 → 497.20] You can watch the video.
[497.20 → 500.48] Um, but, uh, it was a huge pain in the butt.
[500.48 → 502.16] Yeah, that's the TLDW.
[502.16 → 506.32] This is where like, because he didn't skimp out because there was an option.
[506.32 → 506.96] Yeah.
[506.96 → 514.48] He could have just got an external laptop display, mounted it permanently, and then USB-c'd into the laptop and been like,
[514.48 → 515.52] don't worry about that.
[515.52 → 521.76] And that would have been way easier because the thing about mobile display standards, and I really, man,
[521.76 → 524.64] I know I love the finger quotes, but I especially love it here.
[524.64 → 525.60] Is that...
[525.60 → 526.48] Oh, sorry.
[526.48 → 528.96] Is that they are the kinds of standards that...
[532.08 → 537.84] Nobody seems to be able to agree on, and it can, it can just be, it can be as simple as like,
[537.84 → 542.72] the connector looks right, and the receptacle looks right, but if you plug them in it just straight up won't work.
[542.72 → 546.64] And getting your hands on the wiring diagrams or anything can be an absolute nightmare.
[547.12 → 552.64] So working with like, EDP displays is super not the easiest thing in the world.
[552.64 → 554.16] Couple of corrections already, my bad.
[554.16 → 555.68] Apparently it's Union E.
[556.80 → 557.12] Cool.
[557.12 → 557.92] That makes sense.
[557.92 → 559.60] And it's Byron, not Brian.
[559.60 → 563.44] Uh, I'm going to use dyslexia as my excuse there.
[563.44 → 564.24] That actually works.
[564.24 → 565.52] It is spelled right in the dog.
[565.52 → 565.76] Yeah.
[567.68 → 568.08] I don't know.
[568.08 → 568.72] I just read it wrong.
[570.08 → 572.56] But yeah, the display portion was crazy because honestly,
[572.56 → 576.88] when I first saw it, I assumed he was just going to go that route.
[576.88 → 577.28] Right?
[577.28 → 577.60] Yeah.
[577.60 → 578.72] Just use the I.O.
[578.72 → 579.60] Yeah, that would be easier.
[579.60 → 580.00] Make it easy.
[580.00 → 586.08] Yeah, sad magician in chat says calling that a standard is a saint-like generosity.
[587.20 → 588.88] Yeah, it's a mess.
[588.88 → 591.04] But yeah, the display portion is super cool.
[592.40 → 597.92] He also designed the entire power system to allow for charge and discharge of the batteries.
[597.92 → 602.16] In total, it has 62.9 watt-hours of battery capacity and seven hours of battery life.
[602.16 → 605.12] Okay, that is so cool.
[605.12 → 613.68] Like handling lithium battery charging and discharging safely, especially, is not a high school project.
[614.48 → 615.52] That's so cool.
[615.52 → 618.64] This was a little above and beyond, I think.
[618.64 → 623.04] But he went ahead and made his own wireless keyboard with Cherry MX low profile switches
[623.04 → 624.72] and custom 3D printed keycaps.
[624.72 → 626.08] That's where you know he's just having fun with it.
[626.08 → 629.84] When you have, when you have f*** you level of skill, then you just, you have to flex it.
[629.84 → 630.48] Why not?
[630.48 → 630.88] Why not?
[630.88 → 632.56] You have to, you have to flex it, brother.
[632.56 → 633.20] Okay.
[633.20 → 639.28] Um, Byron then designed his own CNC'd aluminum chassis and got it anodized.
[639.28 → 643.28] Uh, the hinge, uh, for the screen uses framework hinges.
[643.28 → 643.76] That's cool.
[643.76 → 644.96] Conveniently available.
[644.96 → 645.12] Makes sense.
[645.12 → 647.76] Shout out framework, investment disclosure framework.
[647.76 → 648.16] Yeah.
[648.16 → 650.88] But like just making parts available for their laptops.
[650.88 → 651.60] Love to see it.
[652.24 → 654.72] All said and done, it boots up faster than his M3 MacBook.
[654.72 → 656.88] He does like a drag race near the end of the video.
[656.88 → 657.36] It's cool.
[657.36 → 657.84] That's so cool.
[657.84 → 662.48] Um, I, I don't, the, the same actual performance, but it boots up quickly, which is sick.
[662.96 → 667.52] Um, and there's a line in here that says, I suspect Apple had a bit more of an R and D budget.
[667.52 → 667.92] Yeah.
[667.92 → 668.48] Yeah.
[668.48 → 670.48] This is a note from Alex Clark from our team.
[670.48 → 672.72] He says, seriously, watch the video.
[673.28 → 678.32] I learned things about how laptops are made, and I think I have, and I'm going to editorialize here.
[678.72 → 683.20] I agree, Alex, and above average understanding of laptops.
[683.20 → 683.52] Yeah.
[683.52 → 687.60] I learned a lot to the point where like I'm planning on watching the video again,
[687.60 → 691.52] because there were parts in there that I thought were like fascinating and I want to absorb it better.
[691.52 → 691.76] Okay.
[691.76 → 697.12] Now our first discussion question, I am hijacking this completely because you and I have talked
[697.92 → 703.76] many times about building your own laptop and how it kind of used to be a thing.
[703.76 → 704.08] Yeah.
[704.08 → 711.04] Like you could buy a bare-bones laptop, and you could, you could pick a pocketed CPU and RAM and storage.
[711.04 → 716.88] And in the case of the one that I, yes, DIY for myself for first year university,
[716.88 → 719.68] you could configure it with alternative battery packs.
[719.68 → 726.24] So I had like a, like a caboose ass battery pack that stuck out of the bottom of my laptop and
[726.24 → 727.68] actually put it up at an incline.
[727.68 → 728.96] No, no, not that one.
[728.96 → 731.92] That was the Acer Aspire one that extended battery I got later.
[731.92 → 732.08] Sorry.
[732.08 → 733.44] No, this one came out the back straight.
[733.44 → 738.08] It was an M5NE, like bare bones, Asus laptop.
[738.08 → 738.40] Anyway.
[739.84 → 743.76] And you and I have talked about it, and we've kind of talked about how like that's, that's
[743.76 → 744.24] dead.
[744.24 → 749.20] You know, everything is so integrated now that building your own laptop is dead, will
[749.20 → 750.00] stay dead.
[750.00 → 756.24] The fact that companies like Nvidia are actively hostile towards it by trying to kill the MXM,
[756.24 → 762.08] like mobile graphics card standard over and over and over again at every possible opportunity
[762.08 → 762.96] makes it dead.
[762.96 → 764.96] Guess not.
[764.96 → 765.76] Except.
[765.76 → 768.72] Someone's senior high school project is just going to demolish that.
[768.72 → 772.16] Except here's something that I didn't see coming.
[773.36 → 775.60] Instead of having modularity, right?
[775.60 → 781.84] And a generic chassis and pocketable CPUs and pocketable RAM and, and pocketable storage or,
[781.84 → 784.24] you know, spottable storage or whatever, right?
[784.24 → 791.28] So we saw all of that go tightly integrated, and we lamented the death of a, you know,
[791.28 → 792.40] DIY laptop.
[793.04 → 800.64] But then it got so much more integrated that now you could take a full system on a chip or
[800.64 → 805.60] system on a module in this case and build a chassis around it and holy crap, you could
[805.60 → 806.64] build your own laptop again.
[806.64 → 812.80] And then now that windows on arm is a thing, theoretically, like you, you could run like full
[812.80 → 818.16] fat freaking windows and, and not, and hand it to someone and have them not even notice.
[818.16 → 818.40] Right.
[818.40 → 822.64] And like, okay, eventually someone would probably, you know, notice they go to run an app that
[822.64 → 824.16] the emulation doesn't work for whatever else.
[824.16 → 828.24] But I'm, I'm just saying like, this could be a computer that you could hand to your auntie
[829.12 → 831.92] and she could just use, and you've built it.
[831.92 → 832.40] Yeah.
[832.40 → 832.72] Yeah.
[832.72 → 833.84] This is so cool.
[833.84 → 835.60] I, I, I just, I didn't see this coming.
[835.60 → 838.16] And honestly, like, yeah, you don't, you don't have crazy GPU power.
[838.16 → 840.24] Like he's talking about some of the limitations he played.
[840.24 → 842.40] This isn't in the notes, but I'm just trying to remember from last night.
[842.40 → 845.28] So I might say some things that are slightly wrong because I watched this video, but,
[845.28 → 847.44] um, he was, he was playing Minecraft on it.
[847.44 → 847.92] Yeah.
[847.92 → 848.64] Like it can play.
[848.64 → 850.32] And I know, yeah, Minecraft, it plays on your phone.
[850.32 → 852.40] It, but it can, it can play games.
[852.40 → 852.88] So what?
[852.88 → 853.84] That's so cool.
[853.84 → 855.36] That's where the hardware's at now.
[855.36 → 859.04] A big flex for him, as far as I could tell was the NPU more.
[859.04 → 863.12] I don't, I don't feel personally like he really made this thing as a gaming machine
[863.12 → 865.84] and not every device that you have has to be a gaming machine.
[865.84 → 866.88] He's got that NPU in there.
[866.88 → 868.48] He can do some AI stuff with it.
[868.48 → 869.04] That's cool.
[869.04 → 871.52] Um, it's, it's highly functional.
[871.52 → 877.36] A lot of like what I use, like my, my work desktop, my worst desktop just needs a functional
[877.36 → 878.56] CPU and some Ram.
[878.56 → 881.28] Like I'm in the browser all the time.
[881.28 → 883.28] Um, yeah.
[883.28 → 884.40] But does it play crisis?
[884.40 → 884.80] Yeah.
[884.80 → 886.32] Oh, this is so cool.
[887.36 → 889.12] Second discussion question.
[889.12 → 892.48] Should we throw some money behind a V2 at the end?
[892.48 → 895.36] We're listed as one of the inspirations for the project.
[896.08 → 896.88] That's sick.
[896.88 → 897.52] I mean, sure.
[897.52 → 899.44] He did shout out the NAS in the video.
[899.44 → 900.24] That's so cool.
[900.24 → 900.56] Yeah.
[900.56 → 901.92] No, I mean, the song.
[901.92 → 902.16] Yeah.
[902.16 → 907.60] Uh, uh, Dan, do you mind just, uh, throwing a we don't, we don't know if he wants that.
[907.60 → 908.00] Yeah.
[908.00 → 908.40] Oh yeah.
[908.40 → 912.32] We have, we have absolutely no idea, and he might not even want to do a V2.
[912.32 → 914.96] I mean, he's clearly moving on to something else.
[914.96 → 916.40] Clearly a super talented kid.
[916.40 → 920.64] I'm sure he could figure out something else cool to, to create, but like, I would, I would
[920.64 → 924.48] absolutely be down to do like a, like a, like a small sponsorship.
[924.48 → 928.80] Or I mean, even if he's just like, yeah, could I just like to get a mod mad and get a bunch of
[928.80 → 934.72] like LTT gear or like, you know, whatever else, or, you know, dude, I'd yeah, sure.
[934.72 → 934.96] Cool.
[935.60 → 936.40] This is awesome.
[936.40 → 938.56] I, I, I, I'm pretty sure I commented on the video.
[938.56 → 943.20] It's like, this is, this is the type of stuff that I really like finding on YouTube.
[943.20 → 943.60] Yeah.
[943.60 → 947.36] Like this is, this is the, the like little rewarding nugget that YouTube's like, you watched
[947.36 → 948.88] a bunch of garbage that I sent you.
[948.88 → 950.40] Here's a here's the thing that you want now.
[950.40 → 955.28] Um, I, I really hope he keeps making content of some kind.
[955.28 → 955.60] Yeah.
[955.60 → 957.20] Or just keeps making cool stuff.
[957.20 → 960.72] Like if someone like an Apple or a Dell or framework.
[960.72 → 962.24] Dude, somebody's got to pick this guy up.
[962.24 → 966.96] If somebody, if somebody picks this guy up, then I just, I want to see him, I want to see
[966.96 → 968.24] him create something amazing.
[968.24 → 974.80] Uh, Dan, if you could just fire it over to, I think, uh, Sean C is handling like sponsorships
[974.80 → 975.84] and stuff like that.
[976.64 → 980.24] So just fire that over there that I consider it green lit for us to,
[980.24 → 982.24] you know, do something if he, if he wants to do something.
[982.72 → 984.24] So cool though.
[984.24 → 984.80] Yeah.
[984.80 → 990.16] I think, I think, you know, the video, especially because it's his, his second video, I think video
[990.16 → 991.04] was hosted really well.
[991.68 → 992.88] I think he has creator chops.
[992.88 → 995.92] He could go that route or yeah, if like a framework or someone else wants to pick him
[995.92 → 997.84] up, this, this dude's going to kill it.
[999.60 → 1000.96] What do you want to talk about next?
[1001.60 → 1005.20] My next one was, uh, the GPU stuff, man.
[1005.20 → 1005.68] Really?
[1005.68 → 1006.48] Oh, okay.
[1006.48 → 1006.80] Sure.
[1006.80 → 1007.92] We can, we can jump into something else.
[1007.92 → 1009.92] You haven't talked about GPUs enough this week.
[1010.24 → 1012.88] It was a pretty exciting week.
[1012.88 → 1016.48] That 50, 90 review was thick.
[1017.04 → 1017.44] Yeah.
[1017.44 → 1022.72] Like it's, I think it's 22 or 22 or 23 minutes long or something like that.
[1022.72 → 1026.00] And not a dull moment at all.
[1026.00 → 1027.84] Like I was doing script review with Adam.
[1028.24 → 1033.12] Um, I ended up reviewing probably about 80% of the script before I went in for my procedure.
[1033.12 → 1037.76] Uh, and, uh, then they finished up the rest when I was in the twilight zone.
[1037.76 → 1041.12] Um, and I was going, I was going through it with him.
[1041.12 → 1042.72] I'm like, good Lord, dude.
[1042.96 → 1049.60] Like a lot of the time, my job as, as an editor is to, is to cut, just cut, cut, cut, uh, keep it
[1049.60 → 1050.08] focused.
[1050.08 → 1054.00] I mean, I talked about this at length on the Colin and Samir podcast, but like, what is
[1054.00 → 1054.72] our point?
[1054.72 → 1056.16] Don't waste the audience's time.
[1056.16 → 1059.76] Like all of these things are so important to the way that we create content and the way
[1059.76 → 1065.36] that we communicate our message, whether it's, you know, is this GPU any good or, you know,
[1065.36 → 1067.92] how do you, how do you scrapyard war together yourself?
[1067.92 → 1069.36] Like a cheap gaming PC.
[1070.24 → 1072.48] The $69 gaming PC is making a return.
[1072.48 → 1072.96] Nice.
[1072.96 → 1074.80] And it's better than ever.
[1075.52 → 1076.16] Pretty exciting.
[1076.16 → 1076.56] Anyway.
[1076.56 → 1077.04] Doing it right now?
[1077.04 → 1077.76] We were shooting that.
[1077.76 → 1078.24] Interesting.
[1078.24 → 1078.56] Yep.
[1078.56 → 1084.64] Anyway, um, the point is that that's my job is to go through and, and edit down for clarity,
[1084.64 → 1085.52] for conciseness.
[1087.60 → 1091.28] I think I ended up adding word count because I was just like, oh my goodness.
[1091.28 → 1092.56] There's dense.
[1092.56 → 1094.00] There is so much here.
[1094.00 → 1099.52] And I applaud anyone in the audience who managed to make it through the whole video.
[1099.52 → 1102.72] Because the thing is, there's a ton of nuance in it.
[1102.72 → 1109.44] And there's a ton, like it's a, I watched it back, um, twice actually once to review it
[1109.44 → 1110.40] for release.
[1110.40 → 1115.84] Um, and then that was at like, I want to say like three in the morning or something like
[1115.84 → 1116.08] that.
[1116.08 → 1120.56] So I, like, I got the call, and I'm like, oh yeah, I had my laptop next to my bed because
[1120.56 → 1121.52] I knew it was coming.
[1121.52 → 1123.36] I'm like, okay, yeah, here are a couple notes.
[1123.36 → 1129.44] And then, and then once again, when I was in my right state of mind and, um, and what
[1129.44 → 1135.92] I noticed about it was good Lord was the cognitive load of watching that video high.
[1135.92 → 1136.48] Yeah.
[1136.48 → 1140.40] Because you had to not only just like kind of listen to us say, yeah, this is good.
[1140.40 → 1146.48] You had to listen to our opinion about whether something was good or bad or somewhere in
[1146.48 → 1147.20] between.
[1147.20 → 1151.44] And then you had to listen to the nuance and the explanation for why that opinion is
[1151.44 → 1152.16] not black and white.
[1152.16 → 1157.44] Because I mean, we talked about this a little bit, I think last week, you know, fake frames
[1157.44 → 1159.52] versus real frames, that whole conversation.
[1159.52 → 1162.48] It's complicated, man.
[1162.48 → 1163.52] I think it was before that, but yeah.
[1163.52 → 1164.96] It's complicated, man.
[1164.96 → 1171.52] It's not as simple as like high FPS, high FPS number, better, more better, or a little
[1171.52 → 1172.08] worse.
[1172.08 → 1177.36] Or like we had that one chart, um, that kind of, we like, we kind of like drop.
[1177.36 → 1183.60] It's almost like this, like, we put this chart on the table that all of a sudden has a 4X
[1183.60 → 1187.52] multi-frame gen on the same chart with the regular 5090.
[1187.52 → 1188.32] Yeah, that one was nuts.
[1188.32 → 1194.24] And one of the things that in my, in spite of being not in a very good state of mind,
[1194.24 → 1197.68] because it was in the middle of the morning, um, one of the things that I noticed, I was like,
[1197.68 → 1203.12] dude, we've got to like highlight more that this is, this is MFG.
[1203.12 → 1207.68] And that's kind of our point is that this is clearly ludicrous and not comparable to
[1207.68 → 1208.72] everything else that's here.
[1209.20 → 1214.24] Um, and so it's, it's just, it's one of those videos that, um, I really enjoyed.
[1214.80 → 1220.72] It made me think and understand, even though like, I'm kind of having to put myself back into
[1220.72 → 1223.84] if I hadn't already script reviewed and looked at NVIDIA's materials and all of those things.
[1224.40 → 1227.04] Uh, but it made me think, and it made me understand better.
[1227.04 → 1232.24] And I thought the thing that stood out to me the best was what an incredible job the team did
[1232.24 → 1235.44] in spite of my relatively minimal involvement.
[1236.24 → 1237.76] I did review most of the script.
[1237.76 → 1241.44] Um, I did work on titling intro angle.
[1241.44 → 1247.20] Um, I obviously hosted little bits of it, including, by the way, I have zero recollection.
[1247.20 → 1248.40] Bunch or spot that?
[1248.40 → 1248.80] Really?
[1248.80 → 1249.36] Nothing.
[1249.36 → 1250.96] Absolutely nothing.
[1250.96 → 1256.00] Uh, we have a we have an exclusive on float plane, like a behind the scenes, um,
[1256.96 → 1260.40] of me having my procedure done, which I guess we can talk about a little bit more later.
[1260.40 → 1267.12] But I'm watching this back is wild dude, because I'm just like, I haven't seen it yet.
[1267.12 → 1268.96] You know, I don't drink and I don't drug.
[1268.96 → 1272.40] So I don't have any experience of watching myself do something that I
[1273.68 → 1273.92] have.
[1273.92 → 1274.32] Don't remember.
[1274.32 → 1274.96] Absolutely.
[1274.96 → 1276.96] Like I've definitely watched myself do stuff.
[1276.96 → 1280.72] I don't remember because it's a video from 17 years ago or whatever, but it's different.
[1280.72 → 1286.56] It's like watching myself do something that I don't recall, but yeah, that seems plausible enough.
[1286.56 → 1294.40] Whereas here I'm behaving in a way that is just, it's me, but it's like, it's loopy me.
[1294.40 → 1294.72] Anyway.
[1294.72 → 1295.36] Interesting.
[1295.36 → 1295.60] Yeah.
[1295.60 → 1296.88] I was, I was, I was watching it back.
[1296.88 → 1300.16] I was, I was telling Yvonne, man, I'm, I'm pretty funny when I'm high.
[1304.64 → 1305.12] Anywho.
[1305.12 → 1306.00] Oh man.
[1306.00 → 1306.56] The, um.
[1306.56 → 1307.92] Did she appreciate the humour?
[1307.92 → 1308.48] Yeah.
[1308.48 → 1313.04] I mean, she was trying to wrangle me and also make a video and like keep me safe.
[1313.04 → 1317.52] So I think she was a little stressed, but, um, I think after the fact, maybe, um,
[1317.52 → 1321.92] anyway, what I was going to say was what an incredible job the team did putting that together
[1321.92 → 1326.16] that man, that makes this place feel less like Linus and more like media group.
[1326.96 → 1329.12] Um, yeah, I, I had a weird
[1330.80 → 1333.84] in watching it and I don't know if this is going to land with everybody,
[1333.84 → 1337.04] but it landed with me for whatever reason in watching it, it felt
[1337.04 → 1342.48] Oh man, I don't want to pay fan service to this idea.
[1342.72 → 1344.48] Um, not in quality.
[1344.48 → 1350.96] It felt incredibly higher in quality to be very clear, but it felt, uh, old LTT is
[1350.96 → 1352.16] because you intro it.
[1352.88 → 1356.56] And then we went to people that were specializing in that at the time.
[1356.56 → 1356.88] Yep.
[1356.88 → 1359.52] Cause that's what we used to do for GPU videos.
[1359.52 → 1362.96] When I first started hosting GPU videos, I did not solo host the video.
[1362.96 → 1365.68] Linus would intro it and talk about the features.
[1365.68 → 1368.56] And then I would jump in and talk about the benchmarks.
[1368.56 → 1369.36] That's how we started.
[1369.36 → 1374.24] So jumping in and having it go like, like Dan, for instance, talking about the AI part
[1374.24 → 1380.08] because Dan does AI things and like all the like, uh, uh, David talking about the, the DLSS stuff
[1380.08 → 1383.20] because he just made a video on forced DLSS and Indiana Jones.
[1383.20 → 1385.76] This is like, all these things are just like, wow, this is really cool.
[1385.76 → 1388.80] This is what the vision has always supposed to be.
[1388.80 → 1391.44] Dude, Oliver killed it.
[1391.44 → 1394.16] He did such a good job.
[1394.16 → 1394.56] I got to that section.
[1394.56 → 1397.36] I was just like, wow, like this is really pro.
[1397.36 → 1399.52] He absolutely killed it.
[1399.52 → 1399.92] Yeah.
[1399.92 → 1402.32] Um, man, I, I don't know.
[1404.00 → 1407.12] I am having a proud dad moment right now.
[1407.12 → 1408.88] This was, this was, this was very cool.
[1408.88 → 1409.36] For real.
[1409.36 → 1410.00] This was really cool.
[1410.00 → 1413.52] And, and it's one of those things where I sent this message internally already.
[1414.00 → 1417.92] Um, so I'm not saying anything that any staff won't have seen already, or if they didn't see it,
[1417.92 → 1419.12] then I'm glad you're seeing it here.
[1419.12 → 1422.00] Uh, but what I said was like, this is the vision.
[1422.80 → 1428.96] This is what this company is supposed to do when absolutely everything is firing on all cylinders.
[1428.96 → 1429.20] Yeah.
[1429.20 → 1433.36] And I will, I'm going to step in and Linus kind of said my line in the intro, but there was,
[1433.36 → 1434.88] there were errors with it.
[1434.88 → 1438.00] Um, most of them were pretty minor.
[1438.00 → 1439.76] There was one that really kind of sucked.
[1439.76 → 1442.24] Um, we're working on fixing them, and they're pinned in the comments.
[1442.24 → 1442.72] Yeah.
[1442.72 → 1447.04] Um, and we've never, we've never claimed video was fantastic, and we're going to have
[1447.04 → 1448.08] some amount of problems.
[1448.08 → 1448.16] Yeah.
[1448.16 → 1451.52] We've never claimed to be perfect, but what we will do is we will keep doing better.
[1451.52 → 1451.84] Yeah.
[1452.32 → 1453.52] We will keep working hard.
[1453.52 → 1454.40] We'll keep doing better.
[1454.40 → 1455.92] And the error rate will not be zero.
[1455.92 → 1458.56] We're going to have some amount of problems until the end of our time, but that's just,
[1458.56 → 1461.04] you know, we'll keep working on improving.
[1461.04 → 1461.28] Yeah.
[1461.28 → 1462.56] It is what it is.
[1462.56 → 1463.04] Super cool.
[1463.04 → 1464.16] I'm very happy with it.
[1464.16 → 1469.60] Um, we managed to pivot the discussion to GPUs and not actually talk about the GPU at all.
[1469.60 → 1472.08] Instead, we just patted ourselves on the back for six minutes.
[1472.08 → 1473.68] So do you want to talk about the GPU at all?
[1474.40 → 1476.96] Uh, what's in these notes here?
[1476.96 → 1478.08] The 5090 reviews are out.
[1478.08 → 1479.52] I watched a bunch of them.
[1479.52 → 1480.48] Fascinating.
[1480.48 → 1485.04] Just like I expected, a lot of people took different angles with it, tested different things.
[1485.04 → 1488.88] This is a generation that I'm going to say again, go watch other people's reviews,
[1489.68 → 1492.48] go read other people's reviews, go do whatever, right?
[1493.92 → 1496.96] It's, uh, it's, it's very interesting.
[1496.96 → 1500.72] The whole story is not out there, even with all the reviews that are out there, in my opinion.
[1500.72 → 1504.24] I think this is going to evolve and show its head more overtime.
[1505.04 → 1508.96] As these different technologies are used more, as we're able to see it in more scenarios,
[1508.96 → 1509.60] stuff like that.
[1510.24 → 1515.76] I also think as the, as the continuation of card embargoes come, we'll learn more and more.
[1517.44 → 1518.96] But yeah, it's, it's fascinating.
[1518.96 → 1522.40] Reviewing GPUs is changing significantly because of all these,
[1522.40 → 1525.92] these, um, you know, AI software features and everything else.
[1525.92 → 1530.32] But anyway, uh, AMD RX 9070 is delayed.
[1530.32 → 1533.76] It is apparently releasing or launching March 2nd.
[1533.76 → 1539.76] The company cites software optimization for FSR 4 as the two reasons.
[1540.56 → 1543.28] Oh, uh, good old brain.
[1543.28 → 1549.60] Uh, the company cites software optimization and FSR 4 as the two reasons why it, it most likely
[1549.60 → 1552.00] decided to delay the launch of RDNA 4.
[1552.00 → 1554.40] Did you see some of the ad campaigns that went live?
[1555.04 → 1557.52] Like in non-North American regions that were like,
[1557.52 → 1558.08] No!
[1558.08 → 1558.64] I didn't.
[1558.64 → 1559.44] Radio 97, let's go!
[1559.44 → 1560.48] I didn't.
[1560.48 → 1561.28] That's rough.
[1561.28 → 1561.68] Yeah.
[1561.68 → 1567.36] I mean, honestly though, this is one of those things where it would be really easy for us
[1567.36 → 1571.60] to dog pile on them and go like, oh, AMD software not ready, AMD this, AMD that.
[1571.60 → 1573.04] But like, good.
[1574.40 → 1575.04] Let them cook.
[1575.04 → 1576.00] Yeah.
[1576.00 → 1576.48] Yeah.
[1576.48 → 1582.24] Like some of the leaks that I've seen seem to indicate that this is going to be a really valid
[1582.24 → 1582.88] card.
[1582.88 → 1587.44] Like it might not be, it might not appease every possible buyer at every price tier,
[1587.44 → 1591.20] but it looks like it will be hopefully a really valid option.
[1591.20 → 1593.84] And if that's the case, then let them cook.
[1593.84 → 1594.56] Yeah.
[1594.56 → 1595.44] Get it done.
[1595.44 → 1595.76] Yeah.
[1595.76 → 1598.80] And then when it's done, let's have a look at it and hopefully it's awesome.
[1598.80 → 1600.80] And I support the delay for sure.
[1600.80 → 1601.04] Yeah.
[1601.04 → 1606.00] Because I mean, here's the thing, like I'm rooting for everybody in the GPU space.
[1606.00 → 1609.36] I'm rooting for Intel, obviously, who's been bringing it to the low end.
[1609.36 → 1616.08] I'm rooting for AMD who has been the only force, even remotely sort of keeping Nvidia
[1616.08 → 1616.56] honest.
[1616.56 → 1623.04] And I'm rooting for Nvidia too, because I want better GPUs and you need that competition.
[1623.04 → 1627.52] I don't want anyone to be in a completely dominant position because that's bad for the
[1627.52 → 1629.52] whole industry, and it's bad for the consumer.
[1629.52 → 1630.88] So this is exciting.
[1630.88 → 1636.48] I will also say, uh, in, in support of them delaying, uh, what I, what I heard from the
[1636.48 → 1641.28] team all week was that the, the driver in the car, everything felt very stable.
[1642.72 → 1647.60] So it wasn't, it wasn't a problem, uh, which, you know, I, I appreciate that.
[1648.16 → 1653.60] Um, AMD's vice president and general manager of the Ry zen CPU and Radeon graphics division
[1653.60 → 1656.64] explains more in this tweet.
[1656.64 → 1663.20] Uh, this one, I really appreciate the excitement for RDNA 4.
[1663.20 → 1667.52] We're focused on ensuring we deliver a great set of products with the Radeon 9000 series.
[1667.52 → 1671.12] We're taking a little extra time to optimize the software stack for maximum performance
[1671.12 → 1673.20] and enable more FSR for titles.
[1673.20 → 1676.96] We also have a wide range of partners launching Radeon 9000 series cards.
[1676.96 → 1681.84] And while some have started building initial inventory at retailers, you should expect
[1681.84 → 1684.80] many more partner cards available at launch.
[1685.44 → 1692.16] Um, and then there's, there's some indication that late January was the initial plan for the
[1692.16 → 1693.92] RX 9000 series launch.
[1693.92 → 1699.84] It's possible that AMD might also have wanted to see how Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti will fare when
[1699.84 → 1701.92] it hits the market in February.
[1701.92 → 1703.20] Now back to Nvidia.
[1703.20 → 1706.40] Nvidia removed the hotspot sensor for the 5090s.
[1706.40 → 1707.04] Uh huh.
[1707.04 → 1712.96] Video cards reported on this and, um, um, Der Bauer spoke about the issue in a recent video
[1712.96 → 1714.48] and reached out to Nvidia for comment.
[1715.28 → 1722.16] Nvidia first told him that the new RTX 5000 series GPUs now report memory temperatures instead.
[1722.16 → 1726.96] But this was already possible with earlier cards, including the RTX 4090 and RTX 3090.
[1726.96 → 1730.64] Yeah, I thought that basically happened once we got temp probes in the memory chips.
[1730.64 → 1731.60] I think so as well.
[1731.60 → 1731.92] Okay.
[1731.92 → 1737.20] Uh, after further probing, they reportedly told him that API changes mean that the hotspot
[1737.20 → 1743.12] temperature is no longer accurate or relevant for, uh, gamers, but didn't go into further detail.
[1743.12 → 1743.76] That's odd.
[1743.76 → 1745.52] This is, this is something I really don't like.
[1745.52 → 1751.04] Um, I mean, it's one thing if they, you know, want to put a disclaimer on it or something like that,
[1751.04 → 1757.68] but clearly Nvidia saw fit to put that sensor in the chip at some point.
[1757.68 → 1763.28] And as someone who has personally relied on hotspot to diagnose issues in the past,
[1763.28 → 1765.92] I, I really, I really don't like this.
[1765.92 → 1772.96] Um, all, I shouldn't say all, I mean, technically the 8800 GTX had an IHS on it, but, but functionally
[1772.96 → 1777.52] speaking, all GPUs are bare die chips.
[1777.52 → 1784.72] And if you have even the, the, the slightest mounting error, um, they can, they can not only,
[1784.72 → 1789.20] you know, run a little hot or not perform properly or whatever, but they, they could,
[1789.20 → 1790.16] they can cook himself.
[1790.64 → 1795.36] Um, and like, if there's, if there's an area where there's like an air gap, which, which will act as an
[1795.36 → 1796.24] insulator.
[1796.24 → 1804.16] And so when you have the hotspot temp, it tends to be from, from my experience, a little bit more sensitive
[1804.16 → 1805.44] to a slight dismount.
[1806.24 → 1811.36] Um, and it can make it, and if you see a huge disparity between the die temp and the hotspot
[1811.36 → 1814.08] temp, it can indicate, um, a mounting issue.
[1814.08 → 1818.32] So you can kind of quickly get the card pulled off, uh, get, get the cooler remounted and then
[1819.04 → 1820.00] get back to it.
[1820.00 → 1824.48] Um, I, I don't have a lot of experience because I was out of the testing game for all the
[1824.48 → 1826.24] generations that had hotspot sensors.
[1826.24 → 1826.64] Yeah.
[1826.64 → 1828.80] Um, but they seemed cool.
[1828.80 → 1836.08] Um, I don't know what this comment is necessarily about, but I'm going to just go for it.
[1836.08 → 1839.28] Uh, first the 5090 die size itself is huge.
[1839.28 → 1840.16] So the, oh yeah.
[1840.16 → 1845.28] So the temperature you'll see reported by tools such as GPU Z will be an average across the die,
[1845.28 → 1849.44] meaning the temperature recorded won't be the same across the entire surface.
[1849.44 → 1853.20] It's just the, the average, um, moving on.
[1853.20 → 1858.16] Nvidia shows off a weird prototype, a Titan design, which some people have been calling
[1858.16 → 1861.76] a 5090 ti, uh, with PCB on the box.
[1861.76 → 1862.48] Oh, that.
[1863.04 → 1863.28] No.
[1863.28 → 1863.60] Yeah.
[1863.60 → 1864.32] 5090 ti.
[1864.32 → 1867.36] I thought there's no, this was rumoured to be more of like, I think there's a different
[1867.36 → 1869.76] rumour about a 5090 ti that I saw.
[1869.76 → 1870.24] Oh.
[1870.24 → 1870.96] I saw.
[1870.96 → 1871.20] Yeah.
[1871.20 → 1873.92] No, this was a 40 series slash Titan prototype.
[1873.92 → 1874.16] Okay.
[1874.16 → 1875.36] So yeah, this is not what I thought.
[1875.36 → 1882.56] I think we talked about this on WAN show, but I just want to say, um, this is pretty cool.
[1883.20 → 1889.92] Um, this leaked like ages ago and was the first indication that we saw that at least
[1889.92 → 1891.52] to my knowledge, it was the first indication.
[1891.52 → 1897.28] It's, it's one of the first indications that we saw that Nvidia was considering an unconventional
[1897.28 → 1899.60] PCB design for an upcoming card.
[1899.60 → 1907.04] And this was rumoured to be, uh, like a 4090 ti or like a 40 series Titan card of some sort.
[1907.60 → 1910.56] And, um, yeah, there, there we go.
[1910.56 → 1918.00] So it put a vertical PCB in it so that it could make much, much more effective use of the shape
[1918.00 → 1920.88] of the GPU to blow air up this way.
[1920.88 → 1921.20] Okay.
[1921.20 → 1922.80] So they're blowing air up this way.
[1922.80 → 1925.92] I mean, the idea is, is pretty simple, right?
[1925.92 → 1930.88] If you're, if you've got a flat thing, and you're blowing air against it, you are effectively
[1930.88 → 1937.20] working against your own cooling fans, and you can do things like you can, you can angle
[1937.20 → 1938.08] what you're blowing against.
[1938.08 → 1944.24] So it kind of goes this way, and you can, you can lift the heat sink stack off of the PCB.
[1944.24 → 1947.52] So it can kind of make its way out and through and around.
[1947.52 → 1952.48] But at the end of the day, you're blowing air into a flat surface, which is going to
[1952.48 → 1956.08] significantly harm your ability to cool your fin stack.
[1956.08 → 1962.24] Um, so this seemed like a really cool way to tackle that by, here you go, uh, putting
[1962.24 → 1965.12] the card on a little like daughter PCB.
[1965.12 → 1968.88] And then you can see here the frame for where the cooler is just kind of blowing through it
[1968.88 → 1969.28] like that.
[1969.28 → 1974.16] And then using some combination of, uh, like heat pipes or vapour chambers to move all
[1974.16 → 1976.00] the heat out into the fin stack.
[1976.00 → 1982.80] Um, when this first leaked, it was like, Whoa, that would be, that would be super, super cool,
[1982.80 → 1983.36] I guess.
[1983.36 → 1987.76] But like, good Lord, our GPU is really going to go to four slots thick.
[1987.76 → 1988.80] Yeah.
[1988.80 → 1992.80] And it seems like Nvidia did the same introspection.
[1992.80 → 1993.44] Yeah.
[1993.44 → 1997.28] And was like, could there possibly, I mean, if we're going to do this daughter board thing
[1997.28 → 2000.80] anyway, could there possibly be another way?
[2000.80 → 2002.80] And floating in the middle was a wild move.
[2002.80 → 2003.44] Very cool.
[2003.44 → 2004.80] The answer is yes.
[2004.80 → 2006.24] And I think it's so cool.
[2006.24 → 2011.04] I don't know why the 5090 surprised me so much because if you go back to some of their
[2011.04 → 2015.84] older designs, especially their dual GPU designs, like, do you remember the 7950 GX2?
[2016.48 → 2017.28] I mean, yeah.
[2017.28 → 2017.68] Yeah.
[2017.68 → 2019.92] This thing, this thing was flipping wild.
[2019.92 → 2020.96] Look at this thing.
[2020.96 → 2021.36] Here we go.
[2021.36 → 2023.44] Let's pull, let's pull up some, let's pull up some images.
[2023.44 → 2024.88] Look at this thing.
[2024.88 → 2026.64] This thing's cray.
[2026.64 → 2030.72] So it's got the main PCB here that plugs into your PCIe slot.
[2030.72 → 2037.28] And then it's got a built-in SLI bridge, which is I recall correctly is like back here somewhere.
[2037.60 → 2041.92] And then it's got a second 7000 series GPU on here.
[2041.92 → 2047.52] And then you can actually, it has an SLI finger still, so you can run quad SLI with two of these.
[2047.52 → 2048.64] I didn't know that.
[2048.64 → 2049.20] At least you could have.
[2049.20 → 2049.76] That's crazy.
[2049.76 → 2050.88] I never realized that.
[2050.88 → 2052.40] Yeah, that thing was freaking wild.
[2053.04 → 2055.12] I knew it was, it was too sandwiched.
[2055.12 → 2059.44] I didn't realize you could, I mean, it makes sense, but I didn't realize you could just buy two of those and have four.
[2059.44 → 2064.72] Okay, Daly here brings up a fascinating conversation that I'd love to pivot to if we kind
[2064.72 → 2066.64] of think we're done talking about the cool.
[2066.64 → 2067.36] Yeah, yeah.
[2067.36 → 2070.72] Anyway, essentially the conclusion is this generation is wild.
[2070.72 → 2072.88] Go watch everybody's video if you have time.
[2072.88 → 2074.00] Yeah, cool.
[2074.00 → 2079.44] So Daly asks, at Luke at Linus, can we bring back SLI for the 5090?
[2079.44 → 2081.44] LOL.
[2081.44 → 2087.76] Okay, here is a wild take that I'm sure is going to get clipped out of context and get me cancelled.
[2090.32 → 2091.12] Not again.
[2091.12 → 2099.04] The 5090 for Nvidia's most affluent gaming customers, the 5090 is a great value.
[2099.04 → 2100.56] Oh no.
[2100.56 → 2102.56] Here, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it.
[2103.28 → 2104.80] Think of the 5090.
[2104.80 → 2107.84] I mean, there's no there's no process node shrink, right?
[2108.40 → 2118.48] So it's, you could kind of think of it as, as, as 40 more, more, like kind of an extension of the previous generation
[2118.48 → 2120.24] with some extra stuff bolted onto it.
[2120.24 → 2127.28] And if you think about it that way, well, for the people that are like, yo, bring back SLI.
[2128.40 → 2129.68] What are you better off with?
[2130.08 → 2131.52] A second 4090?
[2132.40 → 2133.36] Or a 5090?
[2134.48 → 2139.28] If all you're going to get is about 30% more performance, wouldn't you rather have it for another 400?
[2139.28 → 2140.40] That's such a bad take.
[2140.40 → 2144.64] Wouldn't you rather have it for another 400 bucks compared to another 1600 dollars?
[2144.64 → 2147.76] All right, I don't even think I need to misquote you to get you cancelled for that.
[2147.76 → 2149.92] I'm leaving. Have a good night guys.
[2149.92 → 2151.12] Yeah, have a good one Dan.
[2151.12 → 2151.84] Bye.
[2151.84 → 2152.64] I'll give you a reference.
[2152.64 → 2154.72] Anyway, but, but kind of back to serious.
[2154.72 → 2155.28] Don't.
[2156.88 → 2158.48] For, for the associated.
[2158.48 → 2164.08] For the people out there that were buying, you know, 239 Otis, which was the last card that supported SLI,
[2164.08 → 2170.32] or going even further back for the people that were buying, you know, 228 Otis or, you know, two, two Titan Blacks or whatever in SLI.
[2170.32 → 2183.04] Honestly, I think I would, I think I would rather have a slightly bigger monolithic GPU that consistently gets me better performance than one that will occasionally nearly double my performance.
[2183.04 → 2184.32] And have so many issues.
[2184.88 → 2189.84] More often than not run at the same performance for double the power consumption and microstutter all over the place.
[2189.84 → 2194.56] I guess what I'm trying to say is, no, SLI isn't coming back.
[2195.20 → 2199.32] And that's probably an okay or even good thing.
[2199.32 → 2201.12] But we sure can put more transistors on this chip.
[2201.12 → 2207.12] But with that said, it's not that NVIDIA has completely abandoned high-speed interconnects between their GPUs.
[2208.00 → 2216.16] Like if anything, NV72, like their data centre stuff, is doubling, tripling, quadrupling down on what they started with SLI.
[2216.16 → 2225.84] It's just that now, in order to build that high-speed connectivity into the GPU, in order to have it operate fast enough that those GPUs can act as one,
[2225.84 → 2233.88] it takes up so much die area and is so expensive that it makes no sense to build it into every single consumer card,
[2234.02 → 2245.26] knowing that only a tiny fraction of the people who Luke just mocked for being willing to spend that much more for a slight performance gain.
[2245.26 → 2246.40] Well, no, it does depend.
[2246.68 → 2249.02] I think it was said well in our video, right?
[2249.10 → 2251.66] If you're using money to make this thing, then sure.
[2251.88 → 2252.32] No, no, no, no.
[2252.32 → 2253.78] I was talking about the SLI argument.
[2253.94 → 2254.48] Ah, yes.
[2254.48 → 2256.88] Like the same people who would go and spend double for that.
[2257.74 → 2260.78] Yeah, I'd much rather they go and spend a little bit more for 5090.
[2261.74 → 2262.10] 100%.
[2262.10 → 2263.42] 100%.
[2263.42 → 2270.64] So for those small handful of people that are wild enough to go and do that, yeah, I'd rather they have a 5090.
[2270.64 → 2271.76] That's probably what they're buying anyway.
[2271.84 → 2277.18] And for everyone else, yeah, honestly, I think I would rather NVIDIA doesn't just make the thing more expensive.
[2277.92 → 2279.40] And it sucks, right?
[2279.62 → 2286.94] But the reason SLI worked was because with the old interconnects and the old bridges, they weren't that high speed.
[2287.14 → 2288.36] The cost wasn't that high.
[2288.36 → 2299.36] But as resolutions of our monitors went up, as the amount of data flowing between the GPUs increased astonishingly, it just couldn't keep up.
[2299.56 → 2302.34] It just couldn't do it without the cost not making any sense anymore.
[2302.46 → 2303.86] So that's my conclusion.
[2304.38 → 2305.64] No SLI is gone.
[2306.12 → 2311.50] And the 5090, for those folks that would have bought SLI, I stand by this.
[2311.88 → 2312.72] Way better value.
[2312.72 → 2324.08] So AJ, not RJJ, but Flow plane, yeah, anyway, said instead of SLI, I would rather see the ability to split a single card across multiple users, either in VM environment or multi-user game PC.
[2324.22 → 2324.94] Me too.
[2325.86 → 2326.70] Is there that thing?
[2326.92 → 2327.96] No, it's totally a thing.
[2328.04 → 2329.84] GPU virtualization is 100% a thing.
[2329.86 → 2334.28] What's the name of, there's a particular piece of software.
[2335.60 → 2338.52] Oh, I know the one, something hot seat, something.
[2338.88 → 2339.78] I can't remember.
[2339.86 → 2341.40] There's a piece of software that allows you to do it.
[2341.40 → 2343.04] We haven't really played around with it too much.
[2343.22 → 2343.60] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2343.88 → 2345.40] There's a...
[2346.40 → 2347.40] People are saying...
[2347.40 → 2349.86] Someone had it at Whale land.
[2349.98 → 2350.48] That's why I'm referencing it.
[2350.48 → 2351.52] At OX, yeah.
[2351.88 → 2353.08] Yeah, no, it's a thing.
[2353.48 → 2360.96] We, okay, I don't want to give away too much, but we might have a new multi-gamers kind of thing coming.
[2361.22 → 2367.50] And maybe as part of exploring that again and kind of seeing what the state of things is, we could explore that as well.
[2367.52 → 2368.14] I think that'd be cool.
[2368.14 → 2375.00] But yes, there is some really cool slicing stuff, even though NVIDIA doesn't officially support it on their consumer cards.
[2375.32 → 2380.60] That was something that I actually chased Intel about a lot back in the lead up to the release of ARK Alchemist.
[2380.76 → 2389.62] The original ARK GPUs was like, hey, if you guys made this available to consumers, I'd really appreciate that.
[2389.62 → 2397.76] Not because I necessarily think, you know, the A770 is going to be powerful enough that anyone would really want to split it to two gamers running off of the same GPU.
[2398.12 → 2405.28] But because I would love to see some pressure on the incumbents to just make this feature freaking accessible.
[2405.28 → 2411.42] Because there is so much that consumers can do with CPU virtualization.
[2411.42 → 2418.70] And I would love to see the same kind of innovative use cases be possible with GPU virtualization.
[2418.70 → 2425.86] Especially now that they can do so much other than just, you know, push FPS in Counter-Strike or whatever.
[2425.86 → 2427.76] Yeah.
[2427.90 → 2431.46] So, yeah, in conclusion, Dan, yeah, 100% it's a thing.
[2432.04 → 2440.08] And no, NVIDIA has absolutely no intention, as far as I can tell, of making it accessible on their consumer-facing cards.
[2440.20 → 2443.34] A bunch of people have said different names of software solutions in Phil Planet chat.
[2443.38 → 2446.44] I don't remember which one, and I don't know anything about it, really.
[2446.52 → 2449.88] I just remember it was in that video of the LAN at LTX.
[2449.88 → 2450.38] That's the one.
[2450.80 → 2453.76] Oh, Tim in chat says, I was the guy at the LAN.
[2453.98 → 2455.06] It's Astor Multiset.
[2455.06 → 2456.18] Okay, there we go.
[2456.32 → 2456.44] Yeah.
[2456.64 → 2459.58] So I was remembering him and his computer.
[2460.36 → 2461.12] Did he die?
[2461.48 → 2462.20] Oh, my goodness.
[2463.44 → 2463.66] F.
[2464.40 → 2466.78] Yeah, everyone, now, let's go.
[2467.32 → 2467.86] Pay respects.
[2468.66 → 2469.84] Dan kicks it off.
[2469.94 → 2470.38] Love it.
[2470.58 → 2471.08] Love it.
[2471.32 → 2473.66] Taking advantage of his lack of stream delay.
[2474.14 → 2477.58] This guy, this guy winning internet points like that, that's dirty pool, sir.
[2479.72 → 2481.40] All right, what's next, Mr. Dan?
[2482.60 → 2484.42] I would never be able to tell if the stream went down.
[2484.42 → 2487.60] No, we have a thing for that.
[2488.54 → 2489.78] Is it named Dan?
[2489.96 → 2490.26] No.
[2491.94 → 2493.18] I guess merch messages.
[2493.52 → 2496.36] Okay, well, why don't we explain what a merch message is?
[2496.70 → 2499.10] Merch messages are the way to interact with the show.
[2499.10 → 2509.04] Just like Ryan A., you can head over to LTTstore.com, and instead of throwing your money at the screen to send a message into the show, you can throw your money at LTT store.
[2509.04 → 2514.30] In the cart, there will be a little box that will leave you a spot to type up a merch message.
[2514.30 → 2515.20] A merch message.
[2515.26 → 2519.96] It'll go to producer Dan, who will reply to it or will forward it to someone internally who can help you out.
[2520.04 → 2521.76] Like, say, for example, apparently Sammy.
[2521.98 → 2526.84] Or he will curate it for me and Luke to respond to on the show.
[2526.84 → 2534.12] And we've got a few probably pretty interesting things for the merch message inclined to check out today.
[2534.80 → 2537.78] We are delaying the launch of the Monday for now.
[2537.94 → 2540.10] We'll update you guys as soon as we have further information.
[2540.24 → 2542.78] But we do have some other new stuff.
[2542.78 → 2549.16] We're launching four new Labs-branded items, including a Zip-Up hoodie, T-shirt, hat.
[2550.24 → 2553.16] Oh, I did not resize the hat.
[2553.26 → 2554.24] Way to go, Linus.
[2554.32 → 2556.16] Way to be ready for your own show.
[2556.84 → 2557.28] Fantastic.
[2558.60 → 2563.48] Hat and a lanyard that show that sometimes simple is best.
[2564.04 → 2565.76] We don't have any data to back up that claim.
[2566.40 → 2568.06] You will just have to take our word for it.
[2568.98 → 2569.88] I blame Artie.
[2569.98 → 2570.66] Artie wrote that.
[2570.66 → 2572.76] I just read the thing off of the thing.
[2572.90 → 2574.00] Go f*** yourself, San Diego.
[2574.20 → 2574.84] I like that thing.
[2574.86 → 2575.10] Okay.
[2575.58 → 2579.86] The Zip-Up hoodie and the T-shirt are simply black with a Labs tag.
[2580.62 → 2583.12] No flashy logos or outlandish designs.
[2583.38 → 2584.98] Just quality, cozy materials.
[2585.40 → 2588.32] The hat features an embroidered Labs heat sink logo.
[2589.10 → 2589.50] And...
[2589.50 → 2591.38] There it is.
[2591.42 → 2592.04] A little something like that.
[2592.06 → 2592.38] Oh, man.
[2592.50 → 2594.58] And your head will feature Fathead after you take it off.
[2594.66 → 2600.08] And the lanyard is inspired by the Labs phase collection that we released a few months ago with a sleek but colourful design.
[2600.08 → 2601.04] I really like the phase stuff.
[2601.34 → 2602.22] Do you have the lanyard here?
[2602.86 → 2604.26] Uh, it should be...
[2604.26 → 2604.52] Oh.
[2604.90 → 2605.72] Well, it's on the site.
[2605.98 → 2606.82] Do you want to pull up the site?
[2607.18 → 2607.40] Sure.
[2607.54 → 2610.34] In the meantime, I have another update for you guys.
[2611.10 → 2620.72] Seven months ago, we promised that if you got 100,000 likes on the CEO PC build video, which is here,
[2620.72 → 2625.36] that we would actually make this stupid poster.
[2627.26 → 2627.98] Oh, no.
[2628.64 → 2629.38] Oh, no.
[2629.64 → 2630.36] They did it.
[2630.74 → 2631.46] Oh, no.
[2631.82 → 2632.88] Why do they keep doing it?
[2633.06 → 2634.22] I don't know.
[2634.36 → 2635.32] They did it for the Rivian.
[2635.66 → 2636.12] I know.
[2636.32 → 2637.28] They did it for this thing.
[2637.40 → 2637.78] I know.
[2637.90 → 2639.32] It's almost like...
[2639.32 → 2639.40] Here.
[2640.22 → 2641.40] Just hear me out here.
[2641.40 → 2647.36] It's almost like our community might be a bunch of stone-cold members.
[2648.74 → 2650.48] I know.
[2650.68 → 2650.90] I know.
[2651.00 → 2654.30] This is, again, my second controversial take so far.
[2655.14 → 2656.02] Going to get me cancelled.
[2656.28 → 2656.30] Second.
[2656.70 → 2657.30] Second one.
[2657.38 → 2658.62] I feel like we have to be above that.
[2658.66 → 2659.16] Second one.
[2659.64 → 2661.38] I think they might be stone-cold members.
[2661.38 → 2668.28] Anyway, you can get it now at leg.GG slash hope.
[2668.52 → 2673.06] It is available in a small art print or a larger print-to-order poster.
[2676.94 → 2680.48] I think if I get one of these, and I put it behind my desk, it'll just make them, like,
[2680.52 → 2681.10] super embarrassed.
[2681.26 → 2681.96] Yeah, see this.
[2682.34 → 2683.02] This right here.
[2683.62 → 2683.88] Really?
[2684.76 → 2685.52] Like...
[2685.52 → 2687.18] We could put them over all the windows.
[2688.92 → 2690.02] I'm messaging Artie.
[2691.38 → 2692.80] Don't do that.
[2692.96 → 2694.18] Just because it's a...
[2694.18 → 2695.38] It's a...
[2695.38 → 2696.74] It sounds expensive and wasteful.
[2697.12 → 2697.48] Anyway.
[2697.76 → 2698.88] So, that's a thing.
[2699.10 → 2700.40] Is the art print in stock?
[2700.68 → 2701.98] I actually don't know.
[2701.98 → 2703.74] There's, like, a little small one you can get.
[2703.82 → 2704.06] Yeah.
[2704.22 → 2704.38] Yeah.
[2704.40 → 2707.90] The small one is probably the way that most people are gonna want to go.
[2708.00 → 2708.68] See, that's the...
[2708.68 → 2709.28] That's the thing.
[2709.76 → 2710.28] Uh...
[2710.28 → 2710.60] I...
[2710.60 → 2711.96] I think...
[2711.96 → 2712.34] Hold on.
[2712.50 → 2712.74] Yes.
[2712.84 → 2713.02] Yes.
[2713.06 → 2714.60] The small one is not back-ordered.
[2714.70 → 2715.82] But the large one is a...
[2715.82 → 2716.36] Is like a...
[2716.36 → 2717.04] Like a pre-order.
[2717.12 → 2718.24] It's a print-to-order, so...
[2718.24 → 2719.08] I like the...
[2719.08 → 2720.34] They do the size reference.
[2720.48 → 2721.24] They show the small one.
[2721.24 → 2723.42] Amongst other things on, like, the grid.
[2723.58 → 2723.98] That's cool.
[2724.32 → 2724.60] Okay.
[2724.70 → 2725.74] The last LTT store thing.
[2725.78 → 2727.26] I'll get this out of the way really quick.
[2727.72 → 2728.08] Um...
[2728.08 → 2730.68] In response to this comment from last week.
[2730.76 → 2732.38] Please sell the carabiners...
[2732.38 → 2734.58] Like, the replacement zipper pulls as a standalone product.
[2734.66 → 2735.62] There's so many I want to replace.
[2736.08 → 2736.34] Uh...
[2736.34 → 2738.12] I forgot why we said we wouldn't do it.
[2738.30 → 2738.48] Uh...
[2738.48 → 2741.80] We said we were never going to do that because deforming the zipper pull to change the carabiner
[2741.80 → 2745.62] can damage the pull and may cause it to break, especially on low-grade zippers.
[2745.62 → 2746.98] It is even a risk with PKK.
[2746.98 → 2747.66] Uh...
[2747.66 → 2751.08] We don't want to be accountable for zippers breaking on a variety of random products.
[2751.08 → 2755.62] We are only covering breakage that happens on our own bags because of the failure of the
[2755.62 → 2757.04] original carabiner zipper pulls.
[2757.70 → 2761.94] We could technically sell them with a massive disclaimer that it could break, but...
[2761.94 → 2762.66] And this is, uh...
[2762.66 → 2763.90] Nick Light from Creator Warehouse.
[2764.20 → 2766.98] I think that's a massive risk and sets a horrible precedent.
[2767.26 → 2767.94] And I think that's right.
[2768.02 → 2773.98] We should create products that we can stand behind being used in a way that we can realistically
[2773.98 → 2776.28] anticipate that users are going to use them.
[2777.12 → 2777.64] Um...
[2777.64 → 2777.86] Okay.
[2779.06 → 2779.92] Dan, hit me!
[2780.60 → 2781.08] Sure thing.
[2781.48 → 2781.94] Hi, Dale.
[2782.10 → 2785.58] I'm soon leaving behind a decade-long tech career on my own terms.
[2785.66 → 2789.90] What hobbies or special interests would you recommend to somebody who still wants to keep their
[2789.90 → 2791.22] feet wet in the tech world?
[2791.32 → 2791.80] Home lab!
[2792.66 → 2793.54] I mean, that's...
[2793.54 → 2794.62] Let's not keep your feet wet.
[2794.70 → 2796.72] That's keep your feet, like, in the ocean.
[2796.82 → 2796.90] Home lab!
[2796.90 → 2797.26] Dredged!
[2799.18 → 2801.90] I mean, yeah, I think that's totally valid.
[2802.08 → 2802.74] I mean...
[2802.74 → 2803.58] Home labs are sick.
[2804.34 → 2805.20] I want to get a...
[2805.20 → 2806.58] Am I apartment too small?
[2807.00 → 2807.58] Not enough space.
[2808.16 → 2808.80] You know what?
[2808.98 → 2809.42] I...
[2809.42 → 2809.82] Cop out.
[2810.08 → 2811.10] I need to finish...
[2811.10 → 2811.66] I have plans.
[2811.78 → 2813.42] I need to finish painting my stupid bike.
[2813.74 → 2814.18] Um...
[2814.18 → 2815.38] But, like, I think...
[2815.38 → 2816.44] I think painting's stupid cool.
[2816.54 → 2817.40] Stupid cool, yes.
[2817.54 → 2818.38] What's going to happen first?
[2818.80 → 2819.36] I...
[2819.36 → 2820.50] The bike or Final Fantasy VI?
[2822.04 → 2822.40] Bike.
[2822.66 → 2824.24] I will beat you.
[2824.50 → 2824.88] All right.
[2824.96 → 2825.72] Yeah, there's no way.
[2825.82 → 2826.62] I know how far you are.
[2826.78 → 2830.88] And I know how kind of broken the balance is in the Pixel Remaster, so good luck.
[2831.76 → 2832.56] Wait, that makes it harder?
[2833.44 → 2833.80] I...
[2833.80 → 2834.70] In my opinion...
[2834.70 → 2836.62] I have some strong opinions about the Pixel Remaster.
[2836.62 → 2837.60] But you said it made it easier.
[2837.84 → 2838.32] Yeah, it...
[2838.32 → 2838.86] Well, it depends.
[2839.12 → 2841.62] Like, if you just use cheats, then yes, it's much easier.
[2841.88 → 2842.50] Oh, I haven't cheated.
[2842.60 → 2843.54] But if you try to play...
[2844.18 → 2845.48] I haven't cheated, and I haven't wiped yet.
[2845.48 → 2849.34] Yeah, if you try to play properly, then yeah, it could be challenging.
[2849.34 → 2850.58] Boy howdy, it's gotten close.
[2850.82 → 2850.92] Yeah.
[2850.92 → 2856.70] And I think in pushing to not wipe, I've probably done bad things with my economy.
[2857.50 → 2858.00] Could be.
[2858.10 → 2858.74] It might not matter.
[2858.86 → 2860.02] Spent money on potions and stuff.
[2860.36 → 2861.04] Uh, it shouldn't matter.
[2861.20 → 2861.42] Okay.
[2861.54 → 2861.70] Yeah.
[2861.70 → 2866.80] But anywho, anywho, um, yeah, painting, super cool.
[2866.92 → 2868.70] You should wipe, oh my god, I meant...
[2868.70 → 2869.86] You know, no, not that.
[2870.36 → 2872.70] Um, he means be annihilated.
[2873.30 → 2876.60] Uh, anyway, I kind of want to...
[2876.60 → 2877.64] Me after Chipotle.
[2877.84 → 2879.22] Me trying to keep the show on track.
[2879.34 → 2880.56] Good lord, you guys.
[2880.90 → 2882.22] This guy, this guy.
[2882.64 → 2884.56] What do people even tune into this thing for?
[2884.76 → 2886.06] I don't know anymore.
[2887.68 → 2888.88] It's a monkey circus.
[2888.88 → 2889.88] Um...
[2891.70 → 2894.34] Sorry, I just...
[2894.34 → 2895.92] That just caught me off guard.
[2896.70 → 2898.18] So, I want to get into casting.
[2899.16 → 2899.40] Oh.
[2899.62 → 2899.80] Yeah.
[2899.98 → 2900.20] What?
[2900.94 → 2901.16] Yeah.
[2901.86 → 2908.68] Like, I did a class once in high school, and it was super fun and super cool.
[2908.78 → 2908.96] Oh.
[2909.96 → 2910.94] Oh my god.
[2911.94 → 2913.50] Yeah, I'm taking up pornography.
[2913.94 → 2915.12] That's going to be my new career.
[2915.44 → 2915.80] What?
[2916.38 → 2917.38] That's not what I thought.
[2917.56 → 2917.94] Oh, okay.
[2917.94 → 2918.94] Well, what did you think that was...
[2918.94 → 2919.48] You said casting.
[2919.48 → 2921.12] I thought you meant like, uh...
[2921.12 → 2922.00] Like game casting.
[2922.86 → 2923.58] No, not that.
[2924.22 → 2925.02] Okay, casting, it looks like...
[2925.02 → 2927.28] Why would pornography be the next option?
[2928.12 → 2929.04] Linus, don't answer that.
[2930.24 → 2932.12] My client has, uh...
[2932.12 → 2934.68] No understanding of what that means.
[2935.80 → 2936.16] Perfect.
[2937.04 → 2939.08] I was like, this is such a weird...
[2939.08 → 2939.94] No, metal casting.
[2939.94 → 2940.98] What are you even going to cast?
[2941.08 → 2941.60] Like, anode games?
[2941.60 → 2942.64] Metal casting.
[2942.88 → 2943.84] Okay, okay, okay.
[2943.84 → 2945.26] Yeah, so anyway...
[2945.26 → 2946.00] That's sweet, though.
[2946.00 → 2950.08] Yeah, I took a class in high school, metal art and jewellery, and I had a lot of fun with
[2950.08 → 2951.36] it, and I'm...
[2951.36 → 2951.94] On the couch.
[2952.38 → 2953.16] I'm out of...
[2953.16 → 2954.26] Duh.
[2955.12 → 2955.82] Good lord.
[2956.00 → 2956.68] And anyway...
[2956.68 → 2957.50] Why would I have gone there?
[2957.60 → 2957.98] You know what?
[2958.02 → 2958.52] I give up.
[2958.60 → 2960.12] I'm not even going to try.
[2960.38 → 2960.96] You go ahead.
[2961.06 → 2961.74] You do the show.
[2965.56 → 2967.12] You want to get a word in edgewise?
[2967.20 → 2968.04] Have all the words.
[2968.04 → 2972.20] Oh, man.
[2972.30 → 2972.88] Okay, sorry.
[2973.12 → 2975.54] Anyway, casting, metal casting.
[2975.70 → 2979.90] I've seen a bunch of people have relatively solid-looking home setups for that.
[2980.00 → 2980.88] There's cool things you can do.
[2981.06 → 2981.32] Yeah, yeah.
[2981.54 → 2982.38] And so, I don't know.
[2982.48 → 2982.82] It just...
[2982.82 → 2984.24] It looks like a lot of fun.
[2984.32 → 2986.46] It looks very...
[2986.46 → 2987.70] It looks very...
[2987.70 → 2990.10] Or no, I shouldn't say it looks, because I have done it before.
[2990.22 → 2991.46] It can be very cathartic.
[2991.76 → 2996.42] Like, taking something from, like, a rough cast piece to seeing the finished product.
[2996.42 → 2998.72] Have you seen the earrings that Yvonne and I made?
[2999.34 → 3000.08] I believe so.
[3000.22 → 3000.38] Yeah.
[3000.44 → 3002.48] So, we didn't actually do the casting for those.
[3002.86 → 3007.96] We just carved the like, lost wax, like, casting wax things.
[3008.12 → 3008.28] Right.
[3008.40 → 3010.04] And then they did the casting for us.
[3010.06 → 3013.42] And then we did all the like, finishing and polishing and everything.
[3013.86 → 3015.00] And that was super fun.
[3015.06 → 3015.62] And so, yeah.
[3015.62 → 3017.26] I'm just kind of looking at it going, yeah, that would be really fun.
[3017.30 → 3019.54] I need to get my stupid motorcycle finish painted.
[3019.78 → 3021.28] I'm so stressed about it, though.
[3021.36 → 3022.26] I did a...
[3022.26 → 3023.66] I actually have made progress.
[3023.80 → 3024.32] I did...
[3024.32 → 3025.74] I've primed almost everything now.
[3025.74 → 3043.48] And I think what I've discovered is that because I'm using, like, a candy, like a translucent coating on motorcycle parts, which are so multi-surfaced and multi-faceted, that I basically took the difficulty level to 100 out of the gate.
[3043.48 → 3045.44] And I'm probably just doomed.
[3045.86 → 3055.24] And I think what I might need to do is either change my base coat colour to something that can be a solid with just a clear coat on it.
[3055.24 → 3060.04] And I don't have to worry about getting the layering perfectly, perfectly even.
[3060.12 → 3062.16] Because I could do the hood of a car today.
[3062.72 → 3063.28] No problem.
[3063.60 → 3064.52] I could do that.
[3064.84 → 3075.06] But when you're working with a piece that has all these different surfaces and angles and divots and everything, getting it perfectly covered is really, really, really, really, really, really difficult.
[3075.06 → 3077.74] So maybe I should just find...
[3077.74 → 3079.26] Maybe I should just find something else.
[3079.32 → 3082.18] Or if I fail again, then maybe I'll just drop off all the parts and get them painted.
[3082.66 → 3083.14] I think...
[3083.14 → 3085.68] But that would feel like giving up because it would be.
[3085.84 → 3087.86] Do you guys drink, like, pop?
[3088.36 → 3088.84] Like, cans?
[3088.96 → 3089.22] Cans?
[3089.36 → 3090.22] Specifically cans of pop?
[3091.50 → 3092.30] Complicated answer.
[3093.14 → 3095.28] I like cans of soda pop.
[3095.48 → 3095.74] Okay.
[3095.74 → 3097.46] And I often have them in my house.
[3097.50 → 3103.46] So my easiest way to control my urges is to just not have the temptation nearby.
[3103.76 → 3103.90] Yeah.
[3103.96 → 3106.54] So for, like, years and years, we just wouldn't have any soda in the house.
[3107.06 → 3115.20] But because we entertain so much more now that we're moved into the bigger place and now that we do, like, work functions and, like, badminton friends functions...
[3115.20 → 3116.88] Yeah, because I knew at work functions you had them.
[3116.88 → 3118.82] Like, that was our whole thing.
[3118.82 → 3126.86] It's like, why would we need a place this big if we're not gonna, like, bring everybody over and, like, hang out in the pool and stuff, you know?
[3127.00 → 3128.90] We call it pop up here, whatever.
[3128.90 → 3129.50] Yeah, it's called pop.
[3129.52 → 3129.88] Soda.
[3130.38 → 3130.96] Doesn't matter.
[3131.00 → 3131.18] Coke.
[3131.18 → 3131.82] Everyone relax.
[3132.02 → 3132.64] Leave it alone.
[3132.74 → 3133.00] Relax.
[3133.10 → 3134.58] We're all going to be in the same country soon anyway.
[3135.32 → 3138.10] My point was because I believe...
[3138.10 → 3138.56] Sure, fine.
[3138.64 → 3139.02] No, sorry.
[3139.12 → 3139.46] Go for it.
[3139.54 → 3140.06] I thought you were done.
[3140.12 → 3140.52] Wasn't done.
[3140.62 → 3141.14] Go for it.
[3141.16 → 3141.44] Wasn't done.
[3141.48 → 3145.16] The point is we have soda pop in our house.
[3145.24 → 3145.78] Soda pop Coke.
[3145.78 → 3149.32] Because we entertain now, and I found myself drinking it again.
[3149.90 → 3150.24] Okay.
[3150.40 → 3153.08] So I would just, like, have a craving, and it's in the house.
[3153.16 → 3153.78] I'm like...
[3153.78 → 3161.40] And so I started drinking it again and, like, the quickest way for me to put on a spare tire is to start drinking soda regularly.
[3161.42 → 3161.84] Oh, yeah.
[3162.14 → 3171.02] And so what I did was I tried this, like, booby thing.
[3171.98 → 3172.94] They're f***ING awful.
[3173.06 → 3173.54] They're terrible.
[3173.68 → 3174.44] They're, like, the worst.
[3174.44 → 3179.34] It's the worst balance between, like, seltzer water and soda.
[3179.48 → 3180.98] It's the worst of both worlds.
[3181.32 → 3182.34] Memories of cherry.
[3182.58 → 3182.94] But.
[3185.10 → 3186.80] We dipped a cherry in the water.
[3186.88 → 3189.52] We waved it around near a bottle of soda.
[3189.78 → 3190.64] Spectre of lime.
[3193.28 → 3196.24] But I drank one and I, like, had opened it.
[3196.30 → 3197.68] And you know what a cheapskate I am.
[3197.72 → 3200.30] If I have it and I start it, I'll finish it.
[3200.32 → 3201.02] Oh, you might as well.
[3201.18 → 3201.92] Yeah, might as well.
[3201.96 → 3203.78] I mean, I paid for it, so I might as well drink it.
[3203.78 → 3204.00] Yep.
[3204.68 → 3211.66] And what I realized was I could make myself, when I go to the fridge, I could make myself take that instead.
[3212.28 → 3216.14] And that's the way that I'm conditioning myself to not even bother at all.
[3216.14 → 3217.18] And then you don't like it.
[3217.18 → 3222.94] So I stock bubbly in my fridge, and I'll drink probably a solid, like, three or four a week.
[3223.66 → 3227.30] And it's just, like, having it there as an alternative makes me not drink soda.
[3227.44 → 3230.38] So in response to your question, I keep soda in the house.
[3230.54 → 3231.54] I enjoy soda.
[3231.54 → 3241.58] 95% to 98% of the time that I'm craving a soda, I grab a bubbly and I choke it down to punish myself for wanting a soda.
[3241.58 → 3245.28] I'm fairly certain I've seen people build, like, aluminum.
[3246.14 → 3247.24] Yes, it's my methadone.
[3247.24 → 3252.76] Sort of pop, Coke, Dr. Pepper can crucibles where they have, like, a plunger, and they put the can in.
[3252.84 → 3259.38] They plunge it down into the crucible, and they use the cans of pop as their material for their casting.
[3260.24 → 3261.36] Oh, that's pretty cool.
[3261.52 → 3265.08] And I thought you might like that because it's, like, a way to reuse, right?
[3265.62 → 3266.36] That's super cool.
[3266.38 → 3272.52] So, yes, you can effectively recycle aluminum cans, but you're now directly doing it, which is pretty cool.
[3272.60 → 3275.68] So maybe, like, if you were going to involve the kids in this project and stuff.
[3276.00 → 3276.46] Yeah, yeah.
[3277.88 → 3279.52] Daly and FullPlanChat said, I built one.
[3279.58 → 3280.00] They're awesome.
[3280.38 → 3282.30] Yeah, so this, I'm pretty sure this is a thing you can do.
[3282.42 → 3282.96] Super cool.
[3283.08 → 3283.28] Yeah.
[3284.20 → 3286.28] I'm kind of more interested in making, like, jewellery, though.
[3286.38 → 3287.20] So we'll see.
[3287.68 → 3288.34] Yeah, fair enough.
[3289.14 → 3289.20] Yeah.
[3289.86 → 3290.92] I got one more for you.
[3291.06 → 3291.60] Hit us, Dan.
[3292.76 → 3298.82] I got a screwdriver in the initial wave, and it has a nice, gloss, smooth finish.
[3298.96 → 3302.08] However, I noticed that my second one is more matte finish.
[3302.26 → 3306.50] Was this a material change or a nice patina from constant use?
[3306.66 → 3310.10] The truth is I do not 100% know the answer to that.
[3310.22 → 3311.70] I can give you my best guess.
[3312.88 → 3315.42] One, yes, it does gloss out over time.
[3315.42 → 3325.40] Two, while we have not changed our moulds for the OG screwdriver, moulds do not stay exactly the same over time.
[3325.48 → 3325.94] They wear.
[3325.94 → 3331.16] We did buy extremely high quality moulds from Innovation Tool and Dye.
[3331.38 → 3332.50] Innovation or Innovative?
[3332.72 → 3332.96] Whatever.
[3333.22 → 3333.58] IT.
[3334.00 → 3340.94] We bought extremely high quality moulds that should last for like a million plus parts is my understanding.
[3340.94 → 3343.88] But that doesn't mean that they don't change a little bit.
[3343.88 → 3346.88] So both possibly.
[3347.76 → 3351.66] But probably we didn't change something like the surface finish.
[3351.66 → 3358.76] Oh, sure.
[3358.84 → 3359.28] More topics.
[3359.38 → 3360.30] What do you want to talk about, Luke?
[3360.74 → 3371.54] Should we talk about the gaslight, rambling, ridiculous, full of misdirection response to our video?
[3372.68 → 3373.72] From Airs tech?
[3373.72 → 3374.24] Okay.
[3375.76 → 3376.24] What?
[3379.80 → 3380.84] Here it is.
[3380.84 → 3384.90] We did a video earlier this week on the Airs tech.
[3385.34 → 3386.20] I have to give you.
[3386.34 → 3386.94] Sc amulet.
[3387.80 → 3389.16] I keep interjecting today.
[3389.20 → 3389.60] I'm sorry.
[3389.80 → 3390.30] No, that's fine.
[3390.40 → 3391.44] I'm starting to annoy myself.
[3391.62 → 3395.28] I mean, it's like, this is like having an out-of-body experience for me.
[3398.50 → 3400.36] It's amazing you haven't punched me yet.
[3401.58 → 3401.94] No.
[3402.84 → 3404.10] The intro to this video.
[3404.10 → 3404.90] I mean, look at this face.
[3404.98 → 3406.14] Look how punchable it is.
[3406.14 → 3407.28] This is what I was going to say, though.
[3407.32 → 3409.62] The intro to this video was gold.
[3410.84 → 3411.52] Full credit.
[3411.66 → 3412.66] It was so good.
[3412.76 → 3414.78] Full credit to Alex Clark.
[3415.14 → 3415.40] Yeah.
[3415.40 → 3417.14] I was like...
[3417.14 → 3418.34] It was actually amazing.
[3418.34 → 3419.70] I was like, really, dude?
[3419.70 → 3420.26] Are you sure?
[3420.34 → 3421.46] Oh, absolutely, really.
[3421.54 → 3422.68] It was very good.
[3423.14 → 3423.80] Thank you, Alex.
[3423.80 → 3426.38] And then he kind of pitched it through.
[3427.28 → 3431.14] I walked onto the set, and I was like...
[3431.14 → 3434.12] Because I've done a lot of kind of embarrassing stuff on camera.
[3434.36 → 3437.80] But donning that getup, sitting in the incense...
[3438.80 → 3439.02] Dude.
[3439.02 → 3441.90] And he was like sitting there with...
[3441.90 → 3446.68] Dude, the out takes of this are so funny because I think you know I don't do accents very well.
[3447.28 → 3447.48] Yeah.
[3447.56 → 3448.42] At my best.
[3449.00 → 3453.14] I will shift between accents like the sands of the desert.
[3453.32 → 3453.84] Like I just...
[3453.84 → 3455.40] I can't maintain them.
[3455.44 → 3456.48] I don't actually have any training.
[3456.82 → 3458.12] I don't actually practice it.
[3459.12 → 3463.22] So what Alex was doing was he was sitting there on set kind of directing.
[3463.56 → 3467.86] And then he just had a random interview of Russell Brand.
[3468.78 → 3471.96] And he would just play a clip, and then he'd turn it off.
[3472.08 → 3475.74] And then I would try to deliver the next little bit of the line kind of trying to mimic it.
[3477.88 → 3479.20] Dan, were you on set?
[3480.30 → 3481.02] For that?
[3481.18 → 3481.38] No.
[3481.46 → 3481.72] Yeah.
[3481.82 → 3482.08] Okay.
[3482.52 → 3482.78] Okay.
[3483.26 → 3483.82] Oh, man.
[3483.88 → 3484.28] Oh, no.
[3484.34 → 3485.04] I know who it was.
[3485.04 → 3487.10] It was Andrew who was on set.
[3488.12 → 3494.92] And the reason that I wasn't sure is it was someone from the British Isles that was on set.
[3495.02 → 3497.12] And we were talking about my atrocious accent.
[3497.50 → 3498.04] So Andrew.
[3498.38 → 3499.28] Andrew is Irish.
[3500.04 → 3510.02] And having to see his face sitting there so disappointed at whatever it was that was coming out of my mouth.
[3510.58 → 3511.36] That was hard.
[3512.34 → 3513.18] That was hard.
[3514.22 → 3516.26] That intro was so freaking funny though.
[3516.26 → 3518.26] So I saw the...
[3518.26 → 3519.30] I saw, I think...
[3519.30 → 3521.30] Does it allude to the intro in the thumbnail?
[3521.56 → 3522.08] Like, can you...
[3522.08 → 3523.52] Are you in that get up in the thumbnail?
[3524.56 → 3525.66] I don't think so.
[3525.78 → 3527.14] I think we left it out in the thumbnail.
[3527.34 → 3527.68] I know...
[3527.68 → 3528.72] No, I noticed in the thumbnail.
[3528.74 → 3528.76] Hold on.
[3528.78 → 3529.34] Let me go to your laptop?
[3529.52 → 3529.74] Yeah.
[3530.02 → 3533.76] I noticed in the thumbnail that your shirt is like...
[3533.76 → 3534.38] Oh, yeah.
[3534.70 → 3536.30] Very wide and very low.
[3536.34 → 3537.32] I think that's photoshopped.
[3537.36 → 3538.24] What's going on?
[3538.24 → 3541.40] And I clicked on it, and then I couldn't stop watching the intro.
[3541.40 → 3542.36] Okay, we'll show it.
[3542.44 → 3543.36] We'll show it.
[3545.70 → 3546.94] The incense too.
[3547.04 → 3549.22] At first I was like, did they like add that in post?
[3549.48 → 3549.76] Nope.
[3549.86 → 3551.08] There's incense there burning.
[3551.30 → 3551.64] Yeah.
[3552.28 → 3553.40] The whole set.
[3553.80 → 3554.66] Everything's just...
[3554.66 → 3555.84] It's amazing.
[3556.04 → 3557.76] We have a world-class team.
[3558.22 → 3560.30] There's no doubt in my mind about that.
[3561.54 → 3562.06] Anywho.
[3562.20 → 3562.88] Oh, man.
[3563.14 → 3564.50] Let me see if I can...
[3564.50 → 3565.06] Where's the...
[3565.06 → 3565.52] Ah, yes.
[3565.56 → 3565.88] Okay.
[3565.88 → 3569.20] So, they actually...
[3569.20 → 3572.92] Man, when you're down, sometimes it's better to just stay down.
[3573.00 → 3574.80] But they apparently decided...
[3574.80 → 3575.54] Yeah, they responded.
[3575.70 → 3576.58] ...not to stay down.
[3576.96 → 3583.90] So, they posted a blog post debunking Linus Tech Tips' misconception about Ares devices.
[3585.30 → 3586.72] Good gravy.
[3587.86 → 3589.36] Man, this is...
[3589.36 → 3595.78] What is up with, like, people writing extremely long responses?
[3601.72 → 3602.90] Oh, man.
[3603.46 → 3605.18] The device does not block...
[3605.18 → 3605.92] Claim number one.
[3605.98 → 3607.92] The device does not block RF signals.
[3607.98 → 3608.68] So, it's ineffective.
[3608.86 → 3610.54] I mean, it doesn't interact with them at all.
[3610.54 → 3611.54] That's...
[3611.54 → 3614.24] Anyway.
[3615.00 → 3616.54] In short...
[3616.54 → 3617.70] No.
[3617.70 → 3617.74] No.
[3618.54 → 3625.86] Wearing a special amulet does not make the 5G boogeyman less scary.
[3626.44 → 3630.08] And also, Ares Tech, this is embarrassing at this point.
[3631.14 → 3639.76] You're not going to win over anyone who has even a remotely functional understanding of how electromagnetic waves work.
[3640.20 → 3641.46] That's not happening.
[3641.46 → 3655.36] I don't realistically think that any of the people that you are ripping off with your scarlet are going to be deterred by, like, a proper explanation of why it obviously doesn't work.
[3656.84 → 3657.44] Sc amulet.
[3657.44 → 3658.60] So, why are you...
[3658.60 → 3659.58] Why are you even talking?
[3659.86 → 3661.78] Why are you even Streisand affecting our video?
[3662.04 → 3663.78] I really think this is just such a...
[3664.52 → 3666.78] Such an obvious tactical error.
[3666.78 → 3667.38] Error.
[3670.12 → 3671.02] So, anyway.
[3671.12 → 3671.26] Here.
[3671.34 → 3672.60] I will read through the...
[3672.60 → 3676.70] I'll read through my notes instead of just talking about how this is ridiculous.
[3677.36 → 3683.56] Earlier this week, we posted a video on the Ares Tech Life tune and how it doesn't do anything the company says it does.
[3683.92 → 3688.56] In response, they posted on their blog debunking our claims about the Life tune.
[3688.56 → 3698.32] Nothing that we hadn't previously discussed in our video was brought up, and there was no new information because we had already reached out to them as part of our process for making our video.
[3698.86 → 3711.68] They do bring up their EEG testing as a way that they've proven the Life tune works, although we watched the video during research and the test seems to be fatally flawed and fully allows the test subjects to be swayed by the researchers.
[3712.36 → 3713.52] Did they measure a change?
[3714.08 → 3714.42] Yes.
[3714.42 → 3724.38] Yes, but in all likelihood, this was a placebo, and a placebo is a perfectly corpulent way to register a change in someone's behaviour, even physiologically, yes.
[3724.72 → 3724.96] Yeah.
[3725.22 → 3731.34] Now, we could spend a bunch of time picking apart their arguments, but fortunately, Reddit saved us the trouble.
[3731.98 → 3743.82] Eagle Falcon, PhD in physical chemistry, J.C. Calhoun, and Alundra828 have all posted about this whole situation.
[3744.42 → 3745.12] Let's go.
[3745.30 → 3750.46] I think this is a pretty good summary, but, you know, hey, that's their word.
[3750.54 → 3752.02] That's their word, not mine.
[3753.16 → 3754.94] Alex, the writer's thoughts here,
[3754.94 → 3761.24] All I want is a simple, replicable test to show that it does literally anything.
[3762.32 → 3764.32] Airs tech, can you give us that?
[3764.82 → 3770.16] It is normal for companies to show us their internal testing to demonstrate how to independently test and verify their claims.
[3770.60 → 3774.02] Airs tech didn't give us any of that and instead just threw Technobabble at us.
[3774.02 → 3783.40] There is, of course, a chance that, Alex says, he just didn't understand it, but we were able to figure out how the machines at ASML work,
[3783.58 → 3788.30] and this little amulet certainly isn't more complicated than an EUV machine.
[3789.98 → 3790.62] Yep.
[3792.22 → 3793.20] Agreed, Alex.
[3793.92 → 3796.02] Absolutely toasted.
[3796.02 → 3803.48] What else do you want to talk about?
[3804.32 → 3806.00] We've actually got a fair bit today.
[3806.24 → 3807.00] There is many a thing.
[3807.00 → 3808.60] Oh, I want to talk about GTA 6.
[3808.72 → 3809.82] Sorry, I'm going to hijack it.
[3809.82 → 3810.38] Yeah, no, let's do it.
[3810.46 → 3811.62] Let's talk about GTA 6.
[3811.62 → 3819.94] So the headline here is, some game makers hope that Grand Theft Auto 6 will cost up to $100 at launch.
[3819.98 → 3821.66] And let's get through the whole thing.
[3821.74 → 3825.20] I'm going to blow through this pretty quick here, and then we can open it up to discussion.
[3825.72 → 3833.36] Industry analyst Michael Ball wrote in his State of Video Gaming in 2025 that some game makers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100,
[3833.36 → 3841.84] breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles move up to $60, $60 titles move to $70, $70 to $80, etc.
[3842.12 → 3847.90] He stated that game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today.
[3848.88 → 3851.10] Marian's Michael Douse responded on Twitter saying,
[3851.52 → 3853.24] You're not supposed to say this out loud.
[3854.38 → 3856.48] That sounds like something you would say.
[3856.74 → 3861.04] Here's a graph of GTA prices corrected for inflation.
[3863.36 → 3873.78] In real terms, a $70 GTA 6 would be the cheapest ever GTA, which is, yeah, I mean, when you account for inflation, pretty interesting.
[3874.34 → 3877.74] Here's a graph of U.S. prices for packaged video games.
[3880.44 → 3882.46] Shockingly, shockingly flat.
[3883.18 → 3884.62] So this is nominal prices.
[3884.76 → 3885.82] This is what it says on the sticker.
[3886.00 → 3890.06] And then this one right here is the like, adjusted for inflation version.
[3890.06 → 3893.42] So it stands to reason that today, one equals one.
[3893.68 → 3897.24] And in the past, one equals a lot more than one today.
[3898.98 → 3902.62] Redditors were quick to point out that simply adjusting for inflation doesn't tell the whole story.
[3902.64 → 3903.46] And that is true.
[3903.56 → 3906.48] Inflation is so much more complicated than just price go up.
[3906.68 → 3908.22] Some things do not go up.
[3908.28 → 3909.50] Some things actually do go down.
[3910.58 → 3915.58] Physical media had real costs, not just for materials, but also for duplication, packaging, manuals, shipping, etc.
[3915.58 → 3922.52] Sticking with the SNES example, we found an old pricing breakdown from Super Play Magazine.
[3922.74 → 3924.06] Oh, oh, super cool.
[3924.18 → 3925.22] Okay, here we go.
[3925.60 → 3927.62] Breakdown of cost for your average game.
[3928.32 → 3936.68] 1% freight, 4% marketing, 1.7% duty, 4.6% developers royalty, 30% retailers margin.
[3936.68 → 3939.04] So that's where Valve got their number from.
[3940.36 → 3946.86] 15% tax, 33% Nintendo, and 15% publishers margin.
[3947.72 → 3949.56] Shockingly little going to the actual developer.
[3949.72 → 3952.86] I mean, I guess that shouldn't really shock us at this point in the games' industry, but hey, there it is.
[3954.24 → 3959.12] So we know that about, from other sources, that about half of Nintendo's charge was manufacturing,
[3959.32 → 3961.44] so about $10 of the $60 cartridge.
[3962.00 → 3964.42] Now, the bar to entry is arguably lower these days.
[3964.42 → 3967.38] Anyone can publish a game, and there is no sort of shipping and all of that.
[3967.94 → 3970.06] And sales are also significantly higher.
[3970.40 → 3973.82] In 2020, Elden Ring sold 13 million copies in its first month of release.
[3974.34 → 3980.92] Back in 2002, excuse me, the year's bestseller GTA Vice City sold less than 6 million copies by the end of the year.
[3981.48 → 3985.54] The plain and simple truth is there are a lot more gamers out there than there used to be.
[3986.34 → 3988.48] Publisher revenue is also massive.
[3990.06 → 3990.54] I'll let you finish.
[3990.54 → 3997.64] Here's just like a casual look at the kind of revenue that these companies are doing on gaming.
[3997.80 → 4000.02] Sony Interactive, Tencent, Microsoft Gaming.
[4000.02 → 4000.26] Revenue, though.
[4000.72 → 4001.60] We'll get to it.
[4001.60 → 4002.00] We'll get to it.
[4002.00 → 4002.50] We'll get to it.
[4004.08 → 4008.30] The list doesn't include private companies like Valve or Activision Blizzard,
[4008.42 → 4012.50] who reported $8.8 billion in revenue before Microsoft bought them for $68 billion.
[4014.02 → 4014.54] Okay.
[4014.90 → 4016.12] There's a lot to unpack here.
[4016.12 → 4024.94] So with all that in mind, would it be a good thing if GTA 6 was priced at, let's say, $100,
[4025.24 → 4028.28] even though the original article from Michael Ball says $8,200?
[4028.90 → 4036.24] Let's stick with $100 for the sake of, you know, following up our sensationalist, you know, headline regurgitation here.
[4036.24 → 4040.76] I don't suspect Rockstar exactly needs to do it.
[4041.32 → 4045.20] I think they are going to completely kill regardless.
[4046.06 → 4048.32] It might be good for other people in the industry.
[4048.74 → 4057.74] I think the examples of like the SNES cartridge are not necessarily fair because we have been in a predominantly digital distribution environment for a long time now.
[4057.74 → 4065.58] Well, I think that's part of the point is that that is a big part of why we, yeah, we shouldn't have to pay for physical manufacturing and shipping that we don't have anymore.
[4065.58 → 4069.46] But I think you can make that argument for a certain period of time, but eventually that margin has eaten up.
[4069.58 → 4073.20] We've been in predominantly digital distribution for a very long time now.
[4073.58 → 4076.18] It has not been a couple of years.
[4076.28 → 4077.24] Not on the console side.
[4077.70 → 4078.40] I would argue that...
[4078.40 → 4081.68] Even consoles, I think, have been very predominantly digital for a while.
[4081.84 → 4082.74] This generation, yeah.
[4082.74 → 4084.24] Most people I know are downloading stuff.
[4084.24 → 4087.20] But PS4, I...
[4087.20 → 4087.62] Ooh.
[4088.60 → 4090.80] Truthfully, I don't have the numbers.
[4091.14 → 4091.46] I don't know, yeah.
[4091.52 → 4093.44] I'd love to hear from you guys at Float plane Chat.
[4093.54 → 4094.54] I mean, let us know, like...
[4094.54 → 4096.58] We're going to have predominantly PC people, but...
[4096.58 → 4097.82] Yeah, that's fair enough.
[4097.90 → 4099.44] But like, man.
[4099.98 → 4102.76] Yeah, I know 360 PS3 was the start.
[4103.88 → 4105.92] People are saying PS4 was pretty split.
[4106.36 → 4106.66] Yeah.
[4107.02 → 4109.24] Whereas, like, I think it's pretty...
[4110.24 → 4110.72] Oh, man.
[4110.72 → 4113.72] Some of these folks, I mean, yeah, it makes sense that, like, our super...
[4114.24 → 4115.08] ...connected audience...
[4115.08 → 4115.20] ...connected audience...
[4115.20 → 4115.62] ...pies 4 came out in 2013.
[4116.08 → 4123.26] Buddy here is like, I was 50% digital on the 360, which, you know, for our, like, hyper-connected audience actually makes sense.
[4123.34 → 4124.26] Yeah, that might not be that representative.
[4124.26 → 4125.00] But, like, I'm pretty...
[4125.00 → 4126.16] I had a 360, it was all physical.
[4126.16 → 4130.84] I'm pretty sure that armies have taken a fair bit longer to move digital.
[4131.58 → 4132.14] You think so?
[4132.32 → 4135.72] Especially with the inherent advantages of physical media on consoles.
[4135.84 → 4138.76] The fact that you can resell them is so huge.
[4139.00 → 4140.06] It's huge.
[4140.14 → 4141.78] Yeah, but game stores are closing all over the place.
[4141.84 → 4142.44] Well, that I know.
[4142.44 → 4143.38] Because they can't say...
[4143.38 → 4144.70] And that's not new news.
[4144.88 → 4145.40] That's true.
[4145.64 → 4146.56] That's very true.
[4147.52 → 4151.42] Like, it's been big enough impact for stores to close since pre-COVID.
[4151.56 → 4153.96] Well, I think what we can agree on is that we aren't sure.
[4154.66 → 4156.10] Which is at least five years old.
[4156.20 → 4163.18] But we do know that digital distribution has been a huge thing for a lot longer than games have been stuck at around $60.
[4163.18 → 4163.66] Yeah.
[4163.98 → 4169.80] So I don't personally think that the reference back to the SNES cartridge is entirely fair.
[4169.92 → 4170.04] Sure.
[4170.04 → 4172.04] I think it was fair at a point in time.
[4172.12 → 4172.34] Sure.
[4172.62 → 4177.32] And then game prices didn't change at all for, like, over a decade.
[4177.88 → 4178.18] Right.
[4178.18 → 4181.00] So then it stops really being fair, in my opinion.
[4182.40 → 4186.24] I think also, like, some people are pointing out, like, there's way more sales now.
[4186.32 → 4187.06] It's like, yeah, okay.
[4187.16 → 4192.96] But if you look at the development teams at these companies, on average, I'd say they are way bigger now.
[4193.30 → 4194.98] Like, way bigger now.
[4194.98 → 4200.72] The amount of work that is going into making some of these games is incredibly immense.
[4201.38 → 4204.80] So I think that's another, like, kind of yin-yang situation.
[4204.80 → 4207.16] Can I throw in a pitch here?
[4208.60 → 4214.68] Would you support the move to $100 if it meant, hold on.
[4214.70 → 4215.78] Is it $140 right now, Canadian?
[4216.62 → 4223.80] If it meant that we could, as an industry, move away from so many, like...
[4223.80 → 4225.18] Microtransactions?
[4225.34 → 4225.68] Yes.
[4225.88 → 4226.32] Absolutely.
[4226.58 → 4228.20] I would unquestionably agree with that.
[4228.40 → 4238.98] So if the excuse from the industry is that, well, we had to do microtransactions because it was the only way to run our businesses sustainably with the stagnation of video game pricing...
[4238.98 → 4239.88] I don't believe they won't take both.
[4241.58 → 4242.50] Yeah, I know.
[4242.58 → 4243.36] That's where we're headed.
[4243.76 → 4249.64] But you couldn't allow me to imagine a blissful future for just a few moments?
[4249.64 → 4252.00] Dude, if they did it, I would genuinely 100% be on board.
[4252.00 → 4264.28] I used to really, really like doing kind of, like, more difficult things in-game in order to earn, you know, some cosmetic or whatever.
[4264.56 → 4264.68] Yeah.
[4265.38 → 4267.08] I really, really liked that.
[4267.24 → 4275.60] And then, like, you know, trying to get skins in COD by doing certain things with that specific firearm was cool.
[4275.60 → 4277.70] And then now you can buy cooler ones.
[4277.84 → 4278.60] And it's like, well...
[4279.76 → 4280.68] I don't know.
[4280.78 → 4283.70] It genuinely takes away from the game for me.
[4283.94 → 4287.66] So if you can put that back in, that has direct value for me.
[4288.34 → 4289.12] Well, they won't.
[4289.24 → 4289.84] But they...
[4289.84 → 4291.12] I think we all know that's not going to happen.
[4291.12 → 4292.96] I also think, as much as I...
[4292.96 → 4300.62] I honestly think a lot of this can be justifiable in regard to price increase.
[4301.80 → 4304.80] But to a certain degree, I don't know how much it's going to matter.
[4305.04 → 4305.26] Yeah.
[4305.34 → 4310.54] Looking at the economy right now, I don't know that many Canadians, honestly, that can just drop 140 bucks.
[4310.54 → 4315.84] That was my next point, is that at the end of the day, they can theoretically raise the price to whatever they want.
[4316.00 → 4318.20] But the price is going to be whatever the market will bear.
[4318.60 → 4323.30] And as we've seen, especially on the PC side, where the promotions come so fast...
[4323.30 → 4323.84] People are just going to wait.
[4323.96 → 4325.02] And they go so deep.
[4325.08 → 4325.30] Yeah.
[4327.14 → 4328.92] It's going to end up...
[4328.92 → 4334.72] Whatever it starts at, whatever MSRP is, unless you are Nintendo, unless you are Rockstar,
[4334.72 → 4338.78] unless you are one of these AAA developers or publishers,
[4338.78 → 4344.30] you are not going to be able to draw a line in the sand and say,
[4344.42 → 4345.62] UND NO FURTHER!
[4345.74 → 4346.44] You know, this is it.
[4346.48 → 4347.28] This is our pricing.
[4347.68 → 4349.30] It's not going to happen.
[4349.86 → 4352.38] You're going to get whatever you're going to get.
[4352.50 → 4354.32] And you're going to do your Steam summer sale.
[4354.40 → 4354.98] And you're going to do this.
[4355.02 → 4355.60] You're going to do that.
[4356.08 → 4358.16] And I just...
[4358.16 → 4360.24] I don't see the...
[4360.24 → 4362.78] I don't see it having a huge impact.
[4362.96 → 4365.08] Because a $60 game already isn't $60.
[4365.08 → 4372.76] A $60 game is already, you know, $38.99 on Steam, you know, Black Friday or Winter Sale
[4372.76 → 4376.24] or Summer Sale or Spring Break Sale or whatever.
[4376.50 → 4379.06] Some games hold out longer, but it ends up being pretty quick.
[4379.18 → 4380.60] And that's exactly it.
[4380.72 → 4384.06] So we can have this new higher ceiling.
[4384.06 → 4388.92] But basically, I think what's just going to happen is it's just going to go down to the price the market will bear.
[4389.00 → 4389.48] And that will be that.
[4389.58 → 4393.44] Neither of us are claiming to really know anything about the actual economics behind this.
[4393.50 → 4395.22] So, like, you know, maybe that drop...
[4395.88 → 4398.88] Maybe most people have crazy FOMO and buy it right away.
[4399.62 → 4402.28] I'm just looking around in our environment.
[4402.44 → 4407.66] And, you know, if you know anything about it, the economic environment in Canada right now is dire.
[4407.66 → 4409.48] It's really rough.
[4410.06 → 4411.38] So it's not as...
[4411.38 → 4416.08] As far as my understanding goes, the economic environment in the States is genuinely not as bad.
[4416.40 → 4419.96] So if you're feeling it down there, it's terrible up here.
[4420.68 → 4423.72] And a lot of people that I know are just...
[4423.72 → 4426.10] That are doing pretty well comparatively.
[4426.54 → 4427.02] Genuinely.
[4427.50 → 4433.34] Like, people with really solid jobs up here are not going to be dropping $140 on a game.
[4433.34 → 4436.34] Well, it's compounded by the fact that our currency is taking an absolute...
[4436.94 → 4438.22] Yeah, but that's part of it, right?
[4438.36 → 4439.14] Beating right now.
[4439.24 → 4446.34] So anything that, like, is imported from, well, anywhere, effectively our purchasing power has just been...
[4447.06 → 4447.50] Yeah.
[4447.64 → 4454.98] So, like, speaking as Canadians, which is the only thing I can realistically do, this is crushing for us, to be honest.
[4455.62 → 4456.42] Like...
[4456.42 → 4457.40] Yeah, it would be...
[4457.40 → 4458.02] It wouldn't even...
[4458.02 → 4458.58] He's rounding.
[4458.96 → 4462.60] It would be more like $146 at a straight one-to-one conversion.
[4462.60 → 4468.24] Like, it's one of those things where I will often see, you know, Canadians complaining about the pricing on our store.
[4468.42 → 4470.34] It's like, why is your Canadian pricing so bad?
[4470.44 → 4471.96] Because our pricing is in U.S. dollars.
[4472.06 → 4473.34] Our costs are in U.S. dollars.
[4473.66 → 4476.26] Our markup is a certain amount above that.
[4476.68 → 4477.72] And then that's it.
[4477.78 → 4479.16] That's how much the product costs us.
[4479.18 → 4480.08] And that's what our markup is.
[4480.14 → 4486.26] So when it's so high in Canadian dollars, it's because the Lonnie is, like, in the toilet.
[4486.26 → 4494.20] And if I just did a one-to-one conversion out of the goodness of my heart, we would be just losing money on every transaction on LTT Store.
[4494.28 → 4495.50] That's not realistic.
[4495.64 → 4496.28] That's not viable.
[4497.00 → 4500.42] The Wiley in Full Plane chat said, no, Luke should try speaking as a Spaniard.
[4501.96 → 4502.32] Yeah.
[4503.02 → 4503.86] I'd like to hear that.
[4503.86 → 4504.52] I have no idea.
[4504.52 → 4511.80] I'm assuming it's a joke, but even if it's not, I can't imagine what the economy is in all the places around the world.
[4511.90 → 4512.86] We're just talking about Canada.
[4512.94 → 4521.42] And if you want to see some insane graphs, just look up, like, cost of living versus income charts over time for Canadians.
[4521.42 → 4527.42] If you look at a macro trend graph, it won't look much better across most of North America.
[4527.74 → 4532.60] But we're having a particularly acute go of it right now.
[4532.60 → 4533.50] Yeah.
[4533.96 → 4534.82] Yeah, it's rough.
[4534.90 → 4537.74] And it's rough everywhere, as far as I know.
[4537.84 → 4539.92] I just know that it is particularly rough up here.
[4540.06 → 4542.62] Joyce, he says here in the UK, we're not doing much better than you guys.
[4542.72 → 4542.92] Yeah.
[4543.08 → 4543.80] I've heard that, too.
[4544.00 → 4547.32] I don't think a lot of people have the disposable income to jump up to this rate.
[4547.32 → 4554.14] That being said, in times of economic crisis, as far as my understanding goes, entertainment stays an expense for a lot of people.
[4554.14 → 4560.66] And gaming is still one of the best value per hour things you can spend your money on.
[4560.66 → 4562.02] So I could just be totally wrong.
[4562.02 → 4562.38] Yeah.
[4562.48 → 4564.16] I mean, maybe people will cut out.
[4564.40 → 4565.24] They'll cut out travel.
[4565.34 → 4567.66] They'll cut out eating, which we already know is happening too.
[4567.66 → 4568.26] Literally eat less even, potentially.
[4568.26 → 4576.78] When I was overseas, my news feed started to slant more, like, you know, British and Irish and all of that.
[4576.78 → 4577.00] Right.
[4577.44 → 4580.56] And I read this just, like, devastating article.
[4580.56 → 4587.72] And I forget the exact number, which makes me feel even worse because it's just, it's disappearing and nobody even can be bothered to remember the rate at which it's disappearing.
[4587.72 → 4592.64] But it pretty much was, like, talking about the rate at which Irish pubs are closing.
[4593.16 → 4593.50] Oh.
[4594.16 → 4595.90] And it's, like, terrifying.
[4596.48 → 4599.34] Because what's going to replace it?
[4599.68 → 4602.40] What's going to replace the small, independent pub?
[4602.40 → 4603.44] Dude, they're so unique.
[4603.44 → 4606.24] Like, with that character and that history.
[4606.40 → 4607.00] Yeah, nothing.
[4607.28 → 4607.60] Nothing.
[4607.70 → 4609.74] Like, what a Tim fucking Horton's?
[4609.92 → 4612.08] Like, honestly, I don't drink.
[4612.08 → 4612.40] A Taco Bell?
[4612.58 → 4613.08] You don't drink.
[4613.10 → 4613.70] No, no, I don't drink.
[4613.80 → 4613.96] But it's not.
[4613.96 → 4615.26] Neither of us are probably frequent.
[4615.42 → 4619.26] But it's not just the it's not just, from my understanding, it's not the drinking.
[4619.58 → 4620.82] But it's a social thing.
[4621.12 → 4623.88] That's your, that's your, kind of your town square.
[4624.10 → 4626.60] You know, it's your, it's your place to go and, and.
[4626.98 → 4629.62] They're often warm and genuinely pretty inviting.
[4629.82 → 4630.80] Yeah, it's a public house.
[4630.90 → 4631.26] Yeah, yeah.
[4631.34 → 4631.58] Yeah.
[4631.74 → 4632.80] Yeah, exactly.
[4632.94 → 4633.14] There.
[4633.24 → 4633.60] Thank you.
[4633.68 → 4635.00] That's a perfect way of putting it.
[4635.06 → 4636.32] It's right in the name.
[4636.96 → 4637.60] Public house.
[4638.00 → 4640.42] And they're just disappearing.
[4641.44 → 4643.76] 603 says people don't socialize like they used to.
[4643.76 → 4646.82] The drop in the last 20 years of people gathering is astounding.
[4646.96 → 4649.16] And, man, did COVID ever not help with that.
[4649.20 → 4650.04] Oh, no, not at all.
[4650.16 → 4650.32] Yeah.
[4650.82 → 4651.80] Sure didn't help.
[4652.54 → 4656.52] I used to go to eat with people, like, all the time.
[4656.64 → 4657.88] That was, like, how I socialized.
[4658.00 → 4658.44] And now.
[4658.46 → 4659.36] And I honestly can't remember the last day.
[4659.36 → 4660.54] Yvonne and I asked him out.
[4661.20 → 4661.88] No, you don't even remember.
[4661.88 → 4662.58] Was it Earl's?
[4663.20 → 4663.94] With you guys?
[4664.00 → 4664.82] Was the last time I ate up?
[4664.82 → 4665.98] No, we went to Boston Pizza.
[4666.32 → 4666.68] What was that?
[4666.70 → 4667.04] Oh, yeah.
[4668.50 → 4670.32] It wasn't a memorable dinner at all, I guess.
[4671.78 → 4673.08] He knows why that's funny.
[4674.40 → 4674.76] Anyway.
[4675.10 → 4677.68] I was, I was maybe a little focused on other things, okay?
[4678.12 → 4679.66] I sort of forgot about the food.
[4679.66 → 4686.84] And when Yvonne reached out, when Yvonne reached out to him to get some dinner with us, he was like, like, immediate response.
[4687.04 → 4687.38] Why?
[4687.48 → 4688.08] What's wrong?
[4688.54 → 4688.80] Yeah.
[4688.80 → 4695.24] And, like, that's partially on us for not spending time with our friends often enough, apparently.
[4695.62 → 4696.78] Wasn't that actually what I said?
[4696.90 → 4698.04] Something along those lines.
[4698.18 → 4704.44] It's partially on, you know, Luke for not, you know, just being in that mindset.
[4704.74 → 4710.00] And I think it's partially on just, like, all of us for just getting out of the habit of just fucking spending time together.
[4710.54 → 4710.86] You know?
[4711.60 → 4712.24] Why are we?
[4712.38 → 4713.04] Seriously, though, yeah.
[4713.04 → 4713.56] That's our excuse.
[4714.06 → 4715.22] At this point, I don't know.
[4715.76 → 4717.24] I think it's habit-forming.
[4717.38 → 4718.12] It takes, what is it?
[4718.14 → 4719.48] It takes a month to form a habit.
[4720.20 → 4722.64] And COVID for a lot of people was a lot longer than that.
[4722.76 → 4722.92] So.
[4723.30 → 4723.62] Yeah.
[4723.62 → 4727.38] No, he didn't get fired.
[4727.66 → 4730.56] And if he did, we'd do it somewhere much nicer than Boston Pizza.
[4730.96 → 4732.34] You'd fire me at a nice location.
[4732.34 → 4733.52] We'd put him down real nice.
[4735.66 → 4736.82] Wow, that's so interesting.
[4737.16 → 4739.76] I need to, like, pay attention to where you invite me to go eat now.
[4739.76 → 4742.48] Yeah, so if I, like, ever invite you to Gotham's or something, then.
[4742.48 → 4742.70] Yeah, uh-oh.
[4743.36 → 4744.30] Oh, no, no.
[4746.12 → 4747.12] Nice last meal.
[4748.96 → 4751.70] No, I said, yeah, sounds great, with a big smiley.
[4751.76 → 4752.74] Okay, well, it was right away.
[4752.82 → 4753.46] She got a vibe.
[4754.46 → 4756.34] Yeah, I did follow that up with a different message.
[4756.42 → 4756.62] Yeah.
[4756.62 → 4757.64] Yeah, being like, oh.
[4758.98 → 4762.00] So I stand behind, I stand behind the vibe representation.
[4762.32 → 4763.14] I definitely, my, yeah.
[4763.36 → 4766.52] I get away with the first message excuse, but, yeah, yeah.
[4766.62 → 4767.74] Yeah, no, no.
[4768.38 → 4772.08] Yeah, it was a it was a detectable vibe for sure.

[4899.00 → 4904.66] Holding a phone can be challenging sometimes, especially if you have tiny hands like me.
[4905.60 → 4906.50] Thank you, Dan.
[4907.68 → 4908.20] Okay.
[4908.64 → 4911.48] That's why it's time for me to get a grip.
[4911.94 → 4913.00] Oh yeah, there you go.
[4913.06 → 4913.46] Okay.
[4913.62 → 4915.60] With our sponsor, Oh Snap.
[4915.60 → 4919.72] They make phone accessories that don't suck, just like they promise.
[4920.02 → 4922.26] Here are some Snap grips that they sent over.
[4922.36 → 4922.60] Okay.
[4922.70 → 4923.54] So yeah, here you go.
[4923.60 → 4924.48] So there's their Snap grip.
[4924.66 → 4925.36] Oh wait, are there more?
[4925.88 → 4926.78] Is there more, Dan?
[4927.60 → 4929.28] Oh, okay.
[4930.60 → 4931.60] That's pretty straightforward.
[4931.60 → 4932.60] And then also...
[4932.60 → 4935.98] Is it a stand then?
[4936.14 → 4937.76] Whoa, it's also a stand.
[4938.22 → 4938.62] Okay.
[4939.02 → 4940.10] Okay, that's pretty cool.
[4940.60 → 4941.06] And it rotates.
[4941.48 → 4943.52] The grip is also a stand.
[4943.68 → 4946.62] And yeah, Dan wanted me to show that it actually rotates.
[4947.16 → 4952.32] So if you want like the most, you know, comfortable angle or whatever, you want to watch landscape
[4952.32 → 4953.44] or whatever, it moves around.
[4953.52 → 4954.16] Okay, that's pretty cool.
[4955.14 → 4955.84] It's crazy thin.
[4956.08 → 4959.84] 2.5 millimetres, which is smaller than almost any camera bump and will practically never
[4959.84 → 4960.72] get caught in your pockets.
[4961.30 → 4963.58] You can even use it as a kickstand to watch the Sancho.
[4963.64 → 4964.40] Oh, that's awesome.
[4965.32 → 4966.34] And oh, it's magnetic.
[4966.70 → 4971.70] That means you can use any MagSafe accessory mount or charger on top of the grip.
[4972.38 → 4976.84] Or you can stick your phone to a PC case, microwave, or other magnetic surface.
[4976.84 → 4977.44] Oh good.
[4977.54 → 4980.22] You could, yes, you could do that if you really wanted to.
[4980.22 → 4985.36] The Snap grip works on all foams and looks slick with its CNC milled aluminum trim.
[4985.96 → 4987.64] Love can be a pain in the grip.

[5001.24 → 5003.60] Lets oh, do merge messages.
[5003.74 → 5004.74] Thank you, producer Dan.
[5005.28 → 5005.66] Hit me.
[5005.86 → 5006.06] Sure.
[5006.54 → 5009.94] In the past, AMD and NVIDIA competed across every price.
[5009.94 → 5012.62] Now each price point is segmented by a brand.
[5012.92 → 5015.10] Intel low, AMD mid, and NVIDIA high.
[5015.56 → 5018.38] Does the consumer benefit from this similar to how cars are?
[5018.92 → 5023.40] Well, the thing about the automotive space is that at every price point, there is competition.
[5023.76 → 5028.56] Like even if you're buying a $2 million hyper car, you could choose.
[5028.74 → 5030.42] You could shop with Pininfarina.
[5030.90 → 5031.54] You could shop.
[5031.62 → 5033.62] I've probably butchered the pronunciation, but don't worry about it.
[5033.64 → 5034.22] Who the heck is that?
[5034.88 → 5036.14] Ferrari, Lamborghini.
[5036.38 → 5038.02] You could shop with Remap.
[5038.02 → 5044.50] You could, like, you've got, you've actually got an entire smorgasbord of options for like ridiculous hyper cars.
[5044.68 → 5052.40] And then at the low end, things are super competitive and are only going to get more competitive as China continues to export more inexpensive EVs.
[5052.40 → 5064.90] Because when you've got, like, three semi-monopolists almost at each price band, I think the argument that you have competition gets a lot weaker.
[5065.02 → 5068.28] Now, NVIDIA does compete across more than one price bracket.
[5068.28 → 5073.82] They do ultra-high end, ultra, ultra-high end, ultra, ultra, ultra-high end.
[5075.14 → 5076.72] And I am a little bit below that.
[5076.78 → 5079.00] They also do high end and like mid-high.
[5079.00 → 5081.18] And then AMD is competitive.
[5081.30 → 5088.76] And I would say, like, the high end down to the mid-range, especially if we go back and look at their sort of previous generation products that they used to fill the gap sometimes.
[5089.18 → 5090.68] Intel, meanwhile, yeah, low end only.
[5091.34 → 5094.96] Like, low end, but gaming is what I would describe Intel as.
[5095.12 → 5100.14] Because low end used to mean, like, $60 GPUs that are used as a display out.
[5100.14 → 5105.64] I mean, the ARC B580 is still, you know, $250 GPU.
[5105.92 → 5106.86] Like, let's be real.
[5106.92 → 5107.92] This is a gaming card.
[5108.10 → 5114.42] But it's at the low end of the like, legitimate, modern, current generation gaming cards.
[5115.40 → 5120.56] No, I don't think the consumer benefits from this until we have more direct competition.
[5120.86 → 5122.36] At least not enough.
[5124.70 → 5125.14] Yeah.
[5126.18 → 5126.64] Hi, Linus.
[5126.64 → 5127.06] That's mostly it.
[5127.06 → 5132.44] No other videos on The Tonight Show comes close to the number of views yours has.
[5133.02 → 5134.16] Not even Bad Bunny's.
[5134.48 → 5137.18] Why do you think that's, what do you think that's a sign of?
[5137.38 → 5139.22] We would like to hear your comments on that.
[5139.40 → 5139.50] Cheers.
[5139.70 → 5144.40] I think that is as simple as me being YouTube native.
[5145.34 → 5145.52] Yeah.
[5145.66 → 5149.52] Like, where are you going to find Bad Bunny's audience?
[5149.84 → 5151.50] You are going to find it.
[5152.24 → 5155.82] I don't, I honestly don't even know what the most popular.
[5156.38 → 5156.86] Yeah, sure.
[5157.06 → 5158.22] Spotify for sure.
[5158.52 → 5161.56] But I was going to say, like, even like social, like social media platforms.
[5161.68 → 5163.66] I don't know what's most popular in the Latin world.
[5163.96 → 5164.40] Yeah.
[5164.52 → 5165.22] I have no idea.
[5165.38 → 5167.58] But, you know, on those platforms.
[5168.02 → 5168.40] Instagram or something.
[5168.66 → 5173.30] I'm sure I'm going to be getting 26 views for every million that he gets.
[5173.38 → 5178.86] Like, it's a completely different, we're running on different, you know, tracks, essentially.
[5178.86 → 5180.52] And this is home turf.
[5180.52 → 5183.04] I'm going to perform best on YouTube.
[5183.04 → 5184.62] I'm going to kill it on YouTube.
[5184.68 → 5188.04] And anywhere else, I'm going to struggle by comparison.
[5188.04 → 5191.66] With that said, you know, credit to their team.
[5192.66 → 5197.26] Credit to Jimmy and Bad Bunny himself.
[5197.52 → 5199.44] And I did a pretty good job, too.
[5199.60 → 5200.86] Even off YouTube.
[5200.86 → 5203.78] Especially the clips with the glasses.
[5204.42 → 5206.02] Actually, it's performing really well.
[5206.52 → 5207.02] Like, on Facebook.
[5207.02 → 5208.82] Do you mean the colour changing glasses or the screen?
[5208.94 → 5209.62] On Facebook.
[5210.34 → 5211.26] Dude, that segment.
[5211.38 → 5212.88] I think it actually includes both of those.
[5213.30 → 5213.92] That segment is.
[5213.92 → 5215.16] Colour changing glasses are sick.
[5215.24 → 5217.40] Performing cray.
[5217.40 → 5220.56] And I think it's actually doing pretty well on Instagram, as well.
[5220.62 → 5225.38] Which are both platforms where I am not in a particularly strong position.
[5225.88 → 5226.06] Yeah.
[5227.30 → 5229.14] Let me see if I can find it.
[5229.20 → 5231.20] They upload so much stuff.
[5231.20 → 5232.16] That's another thing, too.
[5232.50 → 5239.60] Is a lot of the time, it's hard to evaluate how successful one of their clips was in the first, you know, week.
[5239.86 → 5242.90] Because you'll have stuff that will, over time, go viral.
[5243.00 → 5247.18] Like, there are clips on the Tonight Show YouTube channel that have 100 million views.
[5247.80 → 5250.92] We have never uploaded anything with 100 million views.
[5251.14 → 5251.20] No.
[5251.88 → 5255.00] So, you've got to give them time to cook.
[5255.14 → 5262.96] I do think, like, especially feverish plus years ago, that type of content was getting hyper-pumped by YouTube.
[5263.60 → 5264.14] This is true.
[5266.38 → 5268.80] And, like I said, I think I did a great job.
[5269.26 → 5275.58] But, you've also got to just understand that it's a completely different model.
[5275.58 → 5277.06] It's like a scatter gun.
[5278.36 → 5278.72] Right?
[5278.82 → 5278.96] Yeah.
[5278.96 → 5279.48] They're just going to...
[5279.48 → 5282.42] A lot of them were uploaded, like, at the same time, as far as I could tell.
[5282.44 → 5285.20] They're not optimizing for the YouTube platform at all.
[5285.32 → 5287.28] And we threw our weight behind it, too.
[5287.34 → 5292.42] Like, we made sure to throw social promotion after it to give ourselves the best possible chance.
[5293.10 → 5295.58] Apparently, the top video has 493 million views.
[5295.62 → 5295.78] Yeah.
[5295.82 → 5296.34] There you go.
[5296.84 → 5297.20] Woo!
[5297.34 → 5298.28] There you go.
[5299.34 → 5299.94] That's a lot.
[5300.78 → 5301.94] So, let me see if I can...
[5301.94 → 5303.74] Let me see if I can find...
[5303.74 → 5304.64] Like, this is...
[5304.64 → 5305.16] Yeah, this is wild.
[5305.24 → 5307.14] I can't even find the one that performed really well.
[5307.20 → 5310.52] There's one that has, like, millions of views or something.
[5310.62 → 5312.34] And these are not them.
[5312.76 → 5313.22] I love...
[5313.22 → 5314.08] Can you scroll down a little bit?
[5314.12 → 5318.40] I love that you guys sent that photo in as your official...
[5318.40 → 5319.02] Oh, yeah, buddy.
[5319.12 → 5319.26] Ha!
[5321.20 → 5321.98] We had a backup.
[5322.14 → 5323.62] We had a backup in case they didn't like it.
[5323.66 → 5324.56] The other ones are just so...
[5324.56 → 5325.26] They're so serious.
[5325.34 → 5326.00] So professional.
[5326.24 → 5326.40] Yeah.
[5326.52 → 5328.24] And then it was just, like, wide liners.
[5328.24 → 5329.60] Our backup was sad liners.
[5332.88 → 5334.98] It was a bit of a half-measure backup.
[5335.60 → 5335.96] Yeah.
[5336.68 → 5344.14] We wanted to put them very firmly in a corner of, we can publish a meme picture, or we can
[5344.14 → 5345.20] publish a meme picture.
[5345.34 → 5346.04] Oh, my God.
[5347.32 → 5348.20] Alex's right, dude.
[5348.24 → 5349.06] Make another poster.
[5349.32 → 5350.74] You should do wide liners as a poster.
[5351.04 → 5351.40] No.
[5351.54 → 5352.46] No text on it, even.
[5352.66 → 5354.42] Just huge liners face.
[5354.60 → 5354.76] No.
[5354.84 → 5357.02] We did some, like, meme products with that in the past.
[5357.02 → 5358.16] And honestly, I regret it.
[5358.16 → 5358.98] I wish we didn't do it.
[5359.16 → 5359.22] Okay.
[5359.36 → 5361.44] The people who bought it, they seemed to like it.
[5361.70 → 5363.02] It didn't actually sell that well.
[5363.10 → 5364.86] Like, I was opposed to it in the first place.
[5365.38 → 5366.48] It didn't sell that well.
[5366.56 → 5369.24] And more importantly, I want LTT Store to be serious.
[5369.24 → 5371.58] I think you were doing, like, the sequin pillows and stuff.
[5372.16 → 5373.34] We also did a desk pad.
[5373.40 → 5373.70] I didn't like those either.
[5373.70 → 5374.98] Or we did mouse pads as well.
[5375.22 → 5376.92] Yeah, but that would have been white background, wouldn't it?
[5377.68 → 5378.26] No, no.
[5378.34 → 5379.82] We did, like, Linus face.
[5379.98 → 5380.80] Like, Linus selfie.
[5381.18 → 5382.30] The wide one.
[5382.50 → 5383.46] We did that as a mouse pad.
[5383.72 → 5385.04] I gave one to my dad.
[5385.10 → 5385.32] Yeah.
[5385.32 → 5385.48] Yeah.
[5386.18 → 5387.10] He hates it.
[5387.14 → 5389.24] He has to have it turned away because Linus scares him.
[5389.38 → 5389.60] Yeah.
[5389.70 → 5390.68] So, I don't know.
[5390.80 → 5396.34] I don't want us to become, like, Redbubble, you know?
[5396.56 → 5398.26] Like, first party Redbubble store.
[5398.26 → 5398.78] No, yeah.
[5398.84 → 5401.52] I genuinely thought a poster of it would be funny.
[5401.68 → 5403.24] I didn't like the sequin pillows either.
[5405.18 → 5405.70] But, yeah, anyway.
[5405.70 → 5409.16] I want LTT store to be taken seriously.
[5409.34 → 5410.12] Linus 2025.
[5410.52 → 5411.58] Also LTT store.
[5413.70 → 5417.30] Well, I can't do anything about, like, Elijah making promises.
[5419.70 → 5420.50] Technically, you can.
[5420.60 → 5421.50] Yeah, I was going to say.
[5421.86 → 5423.22] I mean, once it's out in public.
[5423.94 → 5425.20] Well, okay, but I shouldn't.
[5425.20 → 5425.50] Technically, you still can.
[5425.50 → 5425.76] I shouldn't.
[5425.76 → 5430.66] Like, that's, I think that's the strength of our organization, though, is that we allow fresh ideas.
[5430.84 → 5431.76] I don't disagree with this.
[5431.76 → 5440.04] We encourage fresh ideas, and sometimes those fresh ideas are just sort of awful, and we live with those consequences.
[5441.28 → 5442.64] They can come out mouldy.
[5442.88 → 5446.34] It's the curse of growing as an organization.
[5446.48 → 5446.68] Yeah.
[5446.82 → 5451.36] Dan 160 in Flow plane Chat says, at Linus, we are still your boss.
[5451.58 → 5451.84] Yeah.
[5452.60 → 5453.66] I mean, that's the thing, right?
[5453.66 → 5459.04] A weird thing is, like, you think about how connected you are to the company, right?
[5459.14 → 5461.08] You have a lot of feelers and a lot of things that are going on.
[5461.08 → 5464.96] You definitely don't know more than half the things that happen in a week at the company.
[5465.24 → 5465.34] No.
[5466.26 → 5467.48] Like, not even close.
[5467.58 → 5468.08] Not even close.
[5468.26 → 5468.48] Yeah.
[5468.70 → 5468.92] Yeah.
[5469.26 → 5470.50] You can't anymore.
[5470.60 → 5474.68] You've got 100 people, presumably, like, working an entire work week.
[5474.82 → 5476.16] Like, these are...
[5476.16 → 5479.30] More than that when you count the contractors and remotes and stuff?
[5479.32 → 5484.16] Even though, you know, in the grand scheme of things, you know, compared to the kinds of companies that we are talking about, right?
[5484.16 → 5487.54] We're talking about an AMD or an Intel or an NVIDIA or whatever else.
[5487.60 → 5489.62] Like, compared to these behemoths.
[5490.16 → 5491.82] We are tiny peanuts.
[5492.24 → 5495.10] But these are still unfathomable numbers.
[5495.48 → 5496.16] On a weekly basis...
[5497.16 → 5499.96] Let me just do the math here, because it's 40 hours a week per person.
[5499.96 → 5505.06] On a weekly basis, we are doing 4,000 hours...
[5505.06 → 5505.92] How are you supposed to keep up with that?
[5505.96 → 5506.42] ...of work.
[5509.44 → 5510.92] Like, it's...
[5510.92 → 5514.22] On the one hand, sometimes you look at sort of the organizational inefficiencies.
[5514.36 → 5515.16] You go, it's a bloody miracle.
[5515.28 → 5516.06] We can get anything done.
[5516.38 → 5519.96] And then on the other hand, you look at some of the things that we accomplish.
[5520.12 → 5521.10] And you go, holy crap.
[5521.14 → 5522.06] How is this even possible?
[5522.14 → 5522.82] This is incredible.
[5523.74 → 5525.06] Sometimes in the same meeting.
[5525.62 → 5526.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5526.66 → 5527.90] That's actually pretty common.
[5527.90 → 5528.46] Yeah.
[5529.98 → 5532.10] What else we got?
[5533.32 → 5534.70] Yeah, let's maybe do one more.
[5535.76 → 5536.78] Hello, LLD.
[5536.96 → 5540.44] I'm looking into getting a 5090 and possibly doing a giveaway for it,
[5540.54 → 5544.24] or a system, when I launch my PC-themed card game later this year.
[5544.54 → 5547.50] Any advice on hosting a giveaway or things to consider?
[5548.58 → 5549.86] I will say this.
[5550.60 → 5556.52] Hosting a giveaway is not something that we have found is a particularly effective promotional tool.
[5556.52 → 5557.02] Yeah.
[5557.02 → 5560.44] We've had some perfect success with charity auctions.
[5560.44 → 5564.00] Those have done really, really well in terms of resonating with our community.
[5565.22 → 5565.96] That makes sense.
[5566.16 → 5572.48] But the thing about giveaways that we've found is that you think, man, I am making one winner.
[5572.94 → 5573.10] Nice.
[5573.10 → 5574.52] I am making one lucky winner.
[5574.64 → 5574.96] Yeah.
[5575.32 → 5583.60] What you're actually doing, because people are mostly self-centred, which makes sense.
[5584.02 → 5586.90] And I mean this in the context of compared to strangers.
[5587.22 → 5591.62] I think that if you talk to the average person, they are probably extremely generous.
[5592.00 → 5594.20] If their buddy wins it that they know.
[5594.34 → 5595.02] They'll be stoked.
[5595.16 → 5595.32] Yeah.
[5595.32 → 5598.30] But everybody else in the pool is not their buddy.
[5598.66 → 5599.58] They're just a stranger.
[5599.82 → 5601.94] And they would much rather have it for themselves.
[5602.24 → 5607.80] So what effectively you've done is if you have a thousand entries into the draw, is you
[5607.80 → 5610.48] have created 999 losers.
[5610.68 → 5611.38] And minus one.
[5611.50 → 5611.70] Yeah.
[5612.22 → 5612.82] And that's it.
[5613.10 → 5615.46] That's their experience with your brand.
[5615.66 → 5617.00] That's their exposure to your brand.
[5617.00 → 5623.32] You might get people just like signing up for the giveaway, but I doubt that they are going
[5623.32 → 5627.40] to have any kind of long-term affiliation with you or your brand.
[5627.40 → 5633.18] And I have personally not had great experience with just like doing giveaways to, you know,
[5633.24 → 5634.96] promote a thing we're doing or whatever else.
[5635.08 → 5638.16] It doesn't, it hasn't been very effective for us.
[5638.86 → 5640.66] Some brands still do it though.
[5640.78 → 5643.12] And clearly they're getting some kind of ROI like AMD.
[5643.12 → 5648.88] They, they are really into doing the giveaways as part of AMD ultimate tech upgrade just
[5648.88 → 5650.22] as a way to kind of drive engagement.
[5650.22 → 5655.64] Although I do think a lot of the time stuff like that pretty much comes down to like a
[5655.64 → 5660.86] team trying to create a KPI that proves that somebody interacted with the media that they
[5660.86 → 5661.26] sponsored.
[5661.74 → 5664.16] And so it probably comes more down to that.
[5664.24 → 5670.82] Like, Hey, here is provable demonstrable evidence that this, this piece of content we
[5670.82 → 5675.76] sponsored, this AMD ultimate tech upgrade was viewed and people interacted with our brand.
[5675.76 → 5680.34] Even if the giveaway itself has absolutely nothing to do with, you know, what their, um,
[5680.50 → 5682.24] what their desired outcome is.
[5682.24 → 5683.96] Like it's, it's mostly an exposure campaign.
[5684.04 → 5690.50] AMD, uh, exerts functionally zero force on the content of these videos.
[5690.58 → 5693.08] All they ask is that there's an AMD product in it.
[5693.08 → 5697.50] And you guys like, you know, in good faith, don't completely freak ignore it.
[5697.50 → 5702.70] And that's, that's all from my understanding, that's pretty much all that they ask.
[5702.70 → 5704.60] Plus the, uh, the giveaway call call-outs.
[5705.08 → 5707.24] I used to stream a bunch.
[5707.30 → 5713.38] And when I did that, um, at one point in time, my stream was almost functionally a giveaway
[5713.38 → 5713.80] stream.
[5713.90 → 5718.30] I would buy humble bundle keys and other people in the community would buy humble bundle keys
[5718.30 → 5720.22] and we'd put them all in a pile, and we'd give them away.
[5720.22 → 5723.26] And it got to the point where we were giving away so many keys.
[5723.26 → 5727.52] Because I was like almost trying to buffer against this whole, you're just making losers thing
[5727.52 → 5730.36] that it started making losers anyway.
[5730.46 → 5735.34] But the losers it was making were people that only won one game versus other people that
[5735.34 → 5736.82] won more than one game.
[5737.02 → 5739.60] And it got to a point where it was just like, this is toxic.
[5739.70 → 5740.68] This is just stupid.
[5740.68 → 5741.52] So we stopped.
[5741.60 → 5747.12] And then I converted my whole stream to almost effectively charity streaming for like two or
[5747.12 → 5747.68] three years.
[5747.68 → 5751.66] And we raised like, I think in the end over those years, we raised over a hundred grand
[5751.66 → 5753.74] for BC children's and that was cool.
[5753.74 → 5755.56] And that community was really cool.
[5755.56 → 5760.60] And then I moved and stopped streaming, but sick, but that was like, that was the correct
[5760.60 → 5762.14] pivot is basically what I'm saying.
[5763.96 → 5764.40] Yeah.
[5764.86 → 5765.68] Graham's nice guy.
[5766.92 → 5767.36] Okay.
[5767.36 → 5768.14] What's next, Mr.
[5768.18 → 5768.40] Dan.
[5770.16 → 5771.86] Oh, we get to do more topics.
[5772.02 → 5772.16] Woo.
[5772.68 → 5775.18] We have been bamboo sold.
[5776.24 → 5777.00] Bamboo labs.
[5777.12 → 5780.86] The maker of some of the most popular 3d printers for home users has announced a security
[5780.86 → 5786.04] update in which they update their limiting third party tool access.
[5786.32 → 5788.40] For example, certain slicer programs.
[5788.68 → 5792.50] Bamboo claims this update will ensure only authorized access and operations are permitted
[5792.50 → 5795.02] and mitigate risks of remote hacks or printer exposure issues.
[5795.08 → 5797.22] We talked about this a little bit last week.
[5797.34 → 5802.88] The 3d printing community quickly became outraged by this, worried about the long-term effects
[5802.88 → 5809.06] such as that this might allow bamboo in the future to restrict filament types, add a possible
[5809.06 → 5809.58] subscription.
[5810.12 → 5812.26] They also raised many more concerns.
[5813.32 → 5817.26] Bamboo did put out a response titled setting the record straight about our security update
[5817.26 → 5823.60] in which they denied the claims about some people's future concerns like restricting filament or possible subscriptions.
[5824.32 → 5828.46] But they don't seem to have addressed.
[5828.46 → 5834.16] And they said that this is security related only, but people are basically still super not happy about it.
[5834.52 → 5838.70] And I think this is a pretty unnecessary sh** stain on their reputation.
[5838.70 → 5848.18] I'm going to leave this to the people who kind of understand the tools that they're using and the impact better before I wade too deep into it.
[5848.18 → 5856.66] But I will say the reputational damage has obviously been very, very high as someone whose household almost exclusively uses the Bamboo Handy app already.
[5858.24 → 5859.16] Yeah, I know, right?
[5860.00 → 5860.98] It's a great name.
[5860.98 → 5872.18] It's not going to impact me until they like to screw it up even more potentially, but I definitely want to throw my support behind our brothers who want more open tools.
[5873.58 → 5879.66] Samsung has quietly removed Bluetooth connectivity from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen.
[5880.00 → 5887.26] This change takes away air actions, which lets users open apps, navigate through galleries, or use the S Pen as a remote camera shutter.
[5887.26 → 5899.80] Over the many years that I used a Note 9, the camera shutter remote control was probably my most used feature with the stylus.
[5899.86 → 5900.80] People talk about that all the time.
[5900.82 → 5902.04] It is so, or was.
[5902.04 → 5903.50] Like everyone that I know that has an S Pen talks about.
[5903.52 → 5905.06] It was so handy.
[5905.18 → 5909.38] This would be enough for me to not consider an S25 and to just get an S24.
[5910.34 → 5916.04] Samsung explained that the decision was driven by low user engagement and pointed out that similar functions are available in the Galaxy Watch.
[5916.04 → 5920.68] starting at $60 and the Galaxy Ring starting at $300.
[5921.22 → 5921.76] Whoa, interesting.
[5921.90 → 5922.06] Sorry.
[5922.66 → 5927.48] Rest assured in Flip plane Chat said, we are in the DOD supply chain or Department of Defence.
[5927.58 → 5933.70] I'm assuming their American and had to throw out all of our bamboo printers because it requires an account hosted in China now.
[5934.98 → 5935.30] Got him.
[5935.46 → 5935.76] Whoa.
[5937.10 → 5937.54] Crazy.
[5937.54 → 5943.46] So, I guess what he's saying is you should probably sneak onto DOD property and dig through their dumpsters.
[5945.72 → 5946.46] Slash S.
[5947.02 → 5947.68] Slash S.
[5948.06 → 5949.60] Good luck.
[5949.92 → 5950.76] Do not do that.
[5951.00 → 5951.80] Don't even try.
[5952.82 → 5954.24] If you do, vlog it.
[5954.48 → 5954.96] Poor chat.
[5955.16 → 5955.68] Poor chat.
[5957.08 → 5957.86] No, guys.
[5957.94 → 5959.18] If you do, vlog it.
[5959.34 → 5960.44] It's just a prank, bro.
[5960.64 → 5961.40] Contact Shaw.
[5961.52 → 5962.08] It's just a prank.
[5962.08 → 5963.56] Anyway.
[5964.90 → 5969.04] A Redditor has written a script to put words in my mouth.
[5969.84 → 5971.64] Little did he know, he doesn't need a script for that.
[5971.70 → 5974.64] He can just misquote me by snipping out context.
[5974.90 → 5981.72] A Redditor, Labtech901, wrote a script that takes clips of me saying specific words in WAN show Gods
[5981.72 → 5985.42] and rearranges them to make me say whatever they want.
[5985.42 → 5989.56] Let's have a look at some of the results here.
[5990.80 → 5991.86] Dan, do I have audio?
[5994.54 → 5994.98] No.
[5996.86 → 5997.68] Yeah, it's fine.
[5997.82 → 5998.76] I had Twitch chat.
[5998.92 → 6000.16] It opened in a tab by accident.
[6000.62 → 6001.10] Who cares?
[6001.88 → 6004.38] You know, I haven't attacked Twitch chat much lately.
[6005.66 → 6006.10] Yeah.
[6006.18 → 6008.00] I kind of miss my favourite punching bag.
[6008.38 → 6009.20] Love you guys.
[6009.46 → 6010.18] You're awful.
[6010.66 → 6011.06] All right.
[6011.36 → 6011.82] Ready, Dan?
[6011.82 → 6015.54] Hello, my name is Linus.
[6015.66 → 6019.14] Today, I want to talk to you about something very important to me.
[6019.24 → 6020.76] I do not like the viewers.
[6020.94 → 6022.00] I do not like Luke.
[6022.16 → 6023.90] And I definitely do not like Dan.
[6024.00 → 6025.98] I do not like Dan so much.
[6026.10 → 6028.58] That's, I hope he goes away and never returns.
[6028.78 → 6031.10] I also want to talk about how much Jim.
[6033.10 → 6034.60] It reminds me of, um...
[6036.60 → 6039.60] Homer Simpson with the...
[6039.60 → 6040.22] That episode?
[6040.22 → 6042.10] No, there's a...
[6042.10 → 6043.10] There's a...
[6043.10 → 6044.10] Okay, so...
[6044.10 → 6045.42] Apparently it was kind of quiet.
[6045.50 → 6046.90] YouTube farts from back in the day were kind of like that.
[6046.98 → 6048.16] But then there's another...
[6048.16 → 6048.64] There's a...
[6048.64 → 6050.48] Dan, do you want to just drop the link if people want to check it out?
[6050.68 → 6050.92] Yeah, sure.
[6051.08 → 6052.12] There's a YouTube creator.
[6052.18 → 6054.32] I don't know how many people are going to like these songs, but...
[6054.32 → 6056.94] There's a YouTube creator called Young Scrolls that makes...
[6058.10 → 6059.48] What now?
[6059.80 → 6062.20] That makes Elder Scrolls music.
[6062.20 → 6063.28] Like, uh...
[6063.28 → 6066.32] St. GIA, I genuinely really like this EP.
[6066.92 → 6067.28] Uh...
[6067.28 → 6071.10] But then he makes Elder Scrolls music based on voice lines from the game.
[6073.10 → 6073.46] Um...
[6073.46 → 6075.78] Dagger Wave is legitimately a sick song.
[6075.84 → 6076.78] It has 13 million views.
[6076.82 → 6077.46] I'm not surprised.
[6077.54 → 6078.10] It is dope.
[6078.10 → 6079.10] Um...
[6079.10 → 6080.10] It's...
[6080.88 → 6082.38] But it sounds...
[6082.38 → 6083.86] Some of it can sound kind of like that.
[6083.98 → 6084.12] Right.
[6084.16 → 6084.44] Because it's...
[6084.44 → 6086.46] It's lines taken from different parts of the game.
[6087.04 → 6087.72] Um...
[6087.72 → 6088.22] And I...
[6088.22 → 6089.72] I kind of...
[6089.72 → 6090.22] Like...
[6090.22 → 6090.70] They're...
[6090.70 → 6094.54] They're incredibly good at what they do to the point where, like, they make it sound
[6094.54 → 6095.12] good anyway.
[6095.60 → 6096.12] Um...
[6096.12 → 6097.32] And I...
[6097.32 → 6098.32] I did appreciate...
[6098.32 → 6099.00] I saw someone...
[6099.00 → 6101.94] When AI music started kicking off a bunch, people were like,
[6102.00 → 6102.26] Oh!
[6102.34 → 6103.72] Like, you can use this now!
[6103.86 → 6107.60] Like, you don't have to just pull voice lines from the game and, like, stitch them together
[6107.60 → 6108.56] and make your music that way.
[6108.62 → 6112.64] You can make it, like, flow better by making them speak the lines out properly using AI
[6112.64 → 6112.96] voices.
[6113.14 → 6114.24] And they were like, no.
[6115.28 → 6117.80] The reason why I do it the way I do it is because I like it the way I do it.
[6117.84 → 6118.54] And I was like, sick.
[6119.16 → 6119.82] Fair enough.
[6119.90 → 6120.20] Nice.
[6120.54 → 6122.14] But yeah, it immediately...
[6122.14 → 6124.72] Listening to that immediately reminded me of Young Scrolls.
[6124.82 → 6127.88] Dan, do you know what spider web cables are from that last merch message that popped
[6127.88 → 6128.14] up?
[6128.72 → 6131.40] Because I am super interested in fibre splicing and stuff, too.
[6131.44 → 6133.00] I've wanted to do a video on that for a while.
[6133.16 → 6133.54] Oh, really?
[6133.54 → 6135.94] We just need to kind of find an expert to kind of walk us through it.
[6136.64 → 6137.16] Um...
[6137.16 → 6139.72] And then we'll basically just kind of stand there and go, oh, yeah.
[6139.86 → 6141.78] And then we'll try it, and we'll probably fail, and it'll be fun.
[6142.10 → 6145.26] Yeah, because we have a little tiny baby, you know, fusion splicer.
[6145.34 → 6146.44] Yeah, I would love to...
[6146.44 → 6147.08] I'd love to do that.
[6147.08 → 6147.60] I want to do that.
[6147.68 → 6147.90] Can we...
[6147.90 → 6148.20] Can we...
[6148.20 → 6148.56] Can we...
[6148.56 → 6149.04] Can we do that?
[6149.14 → 6149.70] I want to do that.
[6150.00 → 6152.00] Linus, post on the forum in the video suggestion.
[6153.72 → 6154.08] You...
[6154.08 → 6155.60] Did you just tell me to post on the forum?
[6156.00 → 6156.28] Yeah.
[6156.58 → 6156.86] Okay.
[6157.02 → 6158.56] Uh, maybe, uh, instead...
[6158.56 → 6161.72] I actually don't know how to, uh, tell people that we have a video idea.
[6162.84 → 6163.44] Uh...
[6163.44 → 6164.64] Internally, I mean.
[6164.84 → 6165.46] Oh, internally.
[6165.46 → 6167.46] Oh, you can just send it to, um...
[6168.40 → 6168.78] Dance.
[6169.10 → 6169.34] Okay.
[6169.56 → 6169.84] Okay.
[6169.98 → 6170.22] Cool.
[6171.88 → 6172.40] What else we got?
[6172.58 → 6173.16] Bye-bye Blu-ray.
[6173.46 → 6178.00] According to Tom's Hardware, Sony announced that it will end production of recordable Blu-ray
[6178.00 → 6185.32] discs, also mini-disc, which they still made mini-disc, um, MD Data and mini-DV cassettes
[6185.32 → 6186.10] in February.
[6186.60 → 6191.78] The company had already discontinued recordable consumer Blu-ray and optical discs in mid-2024,
[6191.78 → 6195.72] and at the time indicated they would continue production for business and corporate clients
[6195.72 → 6196.88] until it became unprofitable.
[6196.88 → 6198.64] I guess it is this day.
[6199.46 → 6203.38] Some media outlets are mistakenly reporting this as the end of Blu-ray, but professionally
[6203.38 → 6207.26] replicated Blu-ray movies are not affected by this announcement, and Sony is not the
[6207.26 → 6208.50] only producer of blank media.
[6208.86 → 6211.62] Pioneer even has discs that are good for 100 years.
[6212.10 → 6215.58] So that's just a quick little bit I wanted to, uh, throw in there.
[6215.58 → 6217.58] And then finally, TikTok is back.
[6217.94 → 6222.70] On January 18th, two hours before the official ban came into effect, TikTok began shutting
[6222.70 → 6227.32] down its services in the U.S., including cutting live streams that were currently active and
[6227.32 → 6229.80] forced rebooting the app for users who had it open.
[6230.32 → 6234.50] Once it was reopened, they were met with a message explaining the situation and the ban.
[6235.16 → 6239.22] Less than an hour later, the message was changed to explain that they are hopeful about working
[6239.22 → 6243.44] with President Trump to change this ban, and then less than 12 hours later, services
[6243.44 → 6245.66] were restored in the U.S. with the following message.
[6246.26 → 6249.68] Thank you for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that
[6249.68 → 6254.18] they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over
[6254.18 → 6256.14] 7 million small businesses to thrive.
[6257.36 → 6266.68] Um, so TikTok is back, but it has to have 50% ownership be under a U.S.-based company.
[6267.20 → 6270.52] So we will see how that goes.
[6270.52 → 6273.40] I think Mr. Beast is bidding for it.
[6274.34 → 6275.12] Oh boy.
[6275.48 → 6275.74] Yeah.
[6275.88 → 6276.26] All right.
[6277.46 → 6279.78] Why don't we do Land Show After Dark?
[6279.94 → 6280.82] I'm not going to lie.
[6280.92 → 6282.00] My mouth's getting a little sore.
[6282.34 → 6282.98] So, uh...
[6282.98 → 6284.04] You are feeling it a little bit?
[6284.04 → 6285.10] I'm feeling it a little bit.
[6285.24 → 6286.06] That makes sense.
[6286.18 → 6286.34] Yeah.
[6286.48 → 6288.26] I, uh, overall it went really well.
[6288.60 → 6288.66] I...
[6288.66 → 6289.66] I'm very surprised.
[6289.78 → 6291.18] I had the uppers this time.
[6291.28 → 6293.28] I had the lowers last time and I didn't go under.
[6293.28 → 6299.68] I just had local numbing, and they like basically dug in there and got them because they were
[6299.68 → 6300.16] impacted.
[6300.16 → 6302.80] So that is to say they were covered by the gum.
[6303.40 → 6305.14] Um, it was a pretty awful experience.
[6305.14 → 6306.82] I was knocked on my butt for a couple of days.
[6306.90 → 6308.24] I needed the pain meds.
[6308.30 → 6309.46] It was got a little bit infected.
[6309.66 → 6311.70] No, no dry socket, thankfully.
[6312.44 → 6314.46] Um, but yeah, it sucked.
[6314.72 → 6319.44] And then this time, because the experience was so awful last time when they asked me,
[6319.50 → 6321.00] hey, do you just want general anesthesia?
[6321.00 → 6325.28] I've never gone under before, and I've always been a little bit uneasy about it.
[6325.46 → 6330.04] Um, just because like very, very, very occasionally you can like not wake up and stuff.
[6330.04 → 6333.04] Like it's still, you know, chemicals in your body, which is not a thing I'm a huge fan of
[6333.04 → 6333.36] overall.
[6334.06 → 6341.26] Um, but the cost difference was like negligible because contrary to what a lot of, um, people
[6341.26 → 6348.08] think we have an imperfect healthcare system, but it isn't, um, you know, just completely
[6348.08 → 6349.56] horrible across the board.
[6349.56 → 6350.66] There are a lot of things I do like about it.
[6350.72 → 6353.00] There are a lot of things that are numerous flaws.
[6353.06 → 6355.42] There are a lot of things that are bad about it, but there are a lot of things that are not
[6355.42 → 6356.12] that bad about it.
[6356.12 → 6360.68] So the, the, the cost difference for going under general anesthesia was pretty minor.
[6360.86 → 6362.10] And I was like, you know what?
[6362.36 → 6362.74] Sure.
[6363.44 → 6364.74] Let's, uh, let's go for gold.
[6364.74 → 6369.32] So they basically injected the one thing into the IV injected the seventh thing, second thing
[6369.32 → 6372.32] into the IV and I kind of went, Oh yeah, is that it?
[6372.52 → 6376.76] And I woke up, um, hours later, it was shockingly fast.
[6377.40 → 6380.00] Um, so anyway, yeah, so I went under general, they removed the whole thing.
[6380.54 → 6389.14] Um, and then we posted a float plane exclusive of me coming at me heading in and then me coming
[6389.14 → 6389.38] down.
[6389.46 → 6393.64] This is, this is me before, because I wouldn't be driving if I just woke up from general
[6393.64 → 6394.12] anesthetic.
[6394.12 → 6394.80] Still before.
[6394.92 → 6395.14] Ooh.
[6395.78 → 6398.48] Uh, yeah, this is me extremely high.
[6399.02 → 6403.44] Uh, anyway, that's on float plane right now, but you're, but you're smiling and walking
[6403.44 → 6403.84] around.
[6403.98 → 6405.90] So it must not have been that bad.
[6405.90 → 6406.76] Like right off the hall.
[6406.80 → 6407.14] I don't know.
[6407.18 → 6407.64] I don't remember.
[6409.00 → 6409.60] Fair enough.
[6410.10 → 6414.02] Uh, so yeah, that's what I know you were, you were in voice chat playing games with like
[6414.02 → 6415.10] employees.
[6416.66 → 6417.60] I think on Wednesday.
[6417.60 → 6418.48] Like a day or two.
[6418.62 → 6419.04] Oh, really?
[6419.10 → 6419.62] It was Wednesday.
[6419.96 → 6420.10] Yeah.
[6420.18 → 6420.54] I think so.
[6421.24 → 6421.64] I think so.
[6421.76 → 6422.00] No.
[6422.26 → 6422.50] Tuesday.
[6422.70 → 6422.92] Tuesday.
[6422.92 → 6423.48] You sure?
[6423.70 → 6423.84] Yeah.
[6424.14 → 6424.44] Anyway.
[6424.56 → 6424.94] Because I was at the gym.
[6425.34 → 6431.12] Anyway, after I woke up from sort of like my twilight sort of first day, I, uh, it's
[6431.12 → 6431.94] been perfect.
[6432.02 → 6433.34] They did an amazing job.
[6433.44 → 6434.84] The sutures are spotless.
[6435.34 → 6437.26] Um, nothing's really gotten infected or anything.
[6437.42 → 6437.76] And so now.
[6438.04 → 6440.68] No, this was an after work, just people having fun thing.
[6441.24 → 6445.46] Um, now I'm sitting here kind of going like, man, I should, I have even bothered going under
[6445.46 → 6447.14] because it was, yeah, it was overall pretty good.
[6447.16 → 6450.58] I saw a lot of comments that are like, what is he going under general for, for this?
[6450.58 → 6453.22] It's, it's relatively common here for people to do it.
[6453.58 → 6458.28] Um, and the only reason that I did it was cause the experience the first time was pretty,
[6458.84 → 6461.04] uh, was pretty not very good.
[6461.52 → 6463.92] Um, but yeah, the tops are supposed to be easier.
[6464.26 → 6469.44] I just, I guess I just was like, yeah, but like how much easier and if it doesn't change
[6469.44 → 6470.80] things that much, I guess I'll just do it.
[6470.80 → 6478.48] So yeah, I basically had a really, really fit full nap and, uh, and then was this guy
[6478.48 → 6479.06] for a bit.
[6482.34 → 6484.52] You look so out of it.
[6484.58 → 6485.32] Oh my goodness.
[6485.56 → 6486.94] I'm excited to watch that.
[6487.62 → 6488.32] Oh man.
[6488.38 → 6489.08] Oh man.
[6489.16 → 6490.98] I'm assuming there's some Yvonne commentary too.
[6492.90 → 6493.82] Uh, she's filming, right?
[6493.88 → 6494.08] Yeah.
[6494.12 → 6494.36] Yeah.
[6494.36 → 6494.58] Yeah.
[6494.58 → 6494.92] She is.
[6494.96 → 6496.04] She's the one who filmed it.
[6496.04 → 6498.70] All right.
[6498.78 → 6499.38] After dark.
[6500.00 → 6500.86] Yeah, let's do it.
[6501.02 → 6501.28] Yeah.
[6503.40 → 6504.54] There we are.
[6504.90 → 6505.24] All right.
[6505.26 → 6506.26] You ready for some merch messages?
[6506.60 → 6507.00] Yes.
[6507.64 → 6513.34] Hi, DLL building a new PC soon, but not sure whether to go with a 9800 X3D now or wait
[6513.34 → 6515.22] for the 9950 X3D benchmarks.
[6515.72 → 6521.68] What do you think about AMD's claims that the 9950 will match the 9800 gaming performance?
[6521.88 → 6522.76] I think it's pretty likely.
[6522.76 → 6526.34] I mean, most games are not going to be touching more than eight cores these days.
[6526.34 → 6530.26] And so as long as they're steering everything to the right die, and we're not splitting the
[6530.26 → 6538.42] load across CCDs, there's no real reason that a 9950 X3D that I can think of should not
[6538.42 → 6541.60] perform about like a 9800 X3D would.
[6542.30 → 6546.04] Um, as long as they, you know, give it all the power and thermal headroom that it needs,
[6546.06 → 6547.56] as long as you have adequate cooling on it.
[6547.56 → 6552.80] Um, I mean, it's basically got a 9800 X3D there.
[6552.80 → 6558.56] And then it has like another die with eight more 10, five cores, but no 3D V cache.
[6558.70 → 6564.94] So it all comes down to how well AMD through, you know, microcode working with Microsoft,
[6565.22 → 6569.56] all that stuff can, can manage the load and make sure that all the correct load is falling
[6569.56 → 6570.60] on all the correct cores.
[6570.60 → 6577.22] Hey, Lily, Luke, and Dan, after your last tooth removal, you said you didn't want to
[6577.22 → 6579.10] risk, uh, of going under.
[6579.20 → 6580.44] What changed your mind this time?
[6580.90 → 6582.68] Um, I don't know.
[6582.74 → 6583.06] YOLO.
[6585.56 → 6587.20] It's pretty bad last time.
[6587.42 → 6587.66] Yeah.
[6587.76 → 6588.62] It kind of sucked last time.
[6588.62 → 6591.62] I think the chance of risk is pretty low.
[6591.84 → 6592.60] It is pretty low.
[6592.76 → 6593.84] It exists.
[6594.16 → 6594.36] Yep.
[6595.08 → 6599.00] And I, I would, I don't know if I'd ever recommend someone do it just because I wouldn't want
[6599.00 → 6600.02] to be responsible for that.
[6600.02 → 6604.60] I went in saying that I, I didn't want to do it, but then he was like, um, yours are
[6604.60 → 6606.10] growing in like sideways and stuff.
[6606.22 → 6607.04] You need to go under.
[6607.38 → 6612.28] And I was like, well, and I do wonder if me going under general, you know, made me a compliant
[6612.28 → 6614.96] enough patient that they were able to really get in there and do a better job.
[6614.96 → 6616.26] Like I actually do kind of wonder.
[6616.26 → 6617.28] That was also mentioned.
[6617.44 → 6621.04] Mine were like really far back, and they were like, we're going to have to torque your jaw
[6621.04 → 6622.14] around like a lot.
[6622.24 → 6623.72] So it's better if it's kind of droopy.
[6625.52 → 6625.92] Nice.
[6626.10 → 6627.92] And the tongue, as far as my understanding goes.
[6628.40 → 6628.68] Right.
[6628.68 → 6631.04] Can be really annoying if you're like awake.
[6631.50 → 6631.76] Right.
[6631.96 → 6632.20] Yeah.
[6632.38 → 6633.86] Anyway, I don't know.
[6633.98 → 6634.92] I don't know what I'm talking about.
[6636.04 → 6638.08] Linus, the short, Luke, the tall, and Dan, the man.
[6638.20 → 6643.80] Is there any decision that you have made recently that, I don't know, uh, that you from 10 years
[6643.80 → 6645.82] ago wouldn't agree with or vice versa?
[6645.98 → 6649.28] And why can't staff swear even in float plane exclusives?
[6649.40 → 6649.58] Sure.
[6649.58 → 6653.40] I'm going to take the easy cop out answer and I wouldn't have gone under general 10 years
[6653.40 → 6655.24] ago, but I'm just like, yeah, whatever.
[6655.52 → 6655.86] Screw it.
[6656.40 → 6656.86] Go for it.
[6656.94 → 6657.66] I'm, I don't know.
[6657.70 → 6662.98] As I, as I get older, in some ways I'm getting like way more conservative, but as I get older
[6662.98 → 6664.78] in some ways I'm also getting way more YOLO.
[6664.78 → 6667.94] So I don't know how to reconcile that.
[6667.94 → 6670.74] To clarify conservative as in.
[6670.76 → 6672.56] Oh, like in, in terms of being risk-averse.
[6672.74 → 6673.22] There you go.
[6676.18 → 6676.58] Anywho.
[6676.72 → 6678.12] We'll just sit on that for a minute.
[6678.18 → 6680.88] As for whether staff can't swear, they absolutely can.
[6681.00 → 6681.64] We just bleep it.
[6681.82 → 6682.00] Yeah.
[6682.00 → 6682.44] Yeah.
[6682.56 → 6686.26] People, people, people f***ING swear all the f***ING time in this office.
[6686.40 → 6688.02] It's f***ING unprofessional is what it is.
[6688.38 → 6689.04] My bad.
[6689.84 → 6691.04] I learned from Luke.
[6691.04 → 6692.58] I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get better.
[6692.74 → 6694.44] I'm, I'm actually actively working on it.
[6694.50 → 6696.50] It's not working very well, but I'm trying.
[6696.62 → 6698.04] I think it's more punctual now.
[6698.56 → 6698.96] I don't think.
[6698.98 → 6699.58] It's important.
[6701.00 → 6704.06] I don't think it's a, a good thing.
[6704.16 → 6706.04] I also don't necessarily, like, I don't.
[6706.22 → 6706.82] There's a point.
[6706.96 → 6707.82] I'm not really against it.
[6707.88 → 6708.10] Yeah.
[6708.10 → 6714.82] But I think, like, for me, I think it, it can limit the use of language sometimes because
[6714.82 → 6718.72] you use, they're often used as like multi-use words.
[6719.16 → 6719.58] Yeah.
[6719.72 → 6720.50] And, uh.
[6720.58 → 6721.20] Killer words.
[6721.40 → 6721.64] Yeah.
[6722.00 → 6725.60] You can, you can stretch your vocabulary more and stuff by not using them as much.
[6725.64 → 6727.26] I think that's one of the reasons why I want to do it.
[6727.82 → 6728.22] Um.
[6728.32 → 6728.78] Per chance.
[6728.80 → 6731.08] I'm never going to like completely stop.
[6731.42 → 6737.28] But, uh, yeah, I think also being better at reining it in around certain company, like
[6737.28 → 6740.32] kids or whatever else, um, would be good.
[6741.14 → 6741.92] Yes, it would.
[6742.12 → 6742.34] Yeah.
[6742.70 → 6745.48] My kids are going to be old enough that it's not going to matter by the time you get that
[6745.48 → 6745.96] sorted out.
[6746.60 → 6747.36] Luke, really?
[6748.10 → 6748.46] Yeah.
[6748.56 → 6748.88] It's not.
[6750.02 → 6753.44] My biggest problem is generally when we're like playing games.
[6753.44 → 6754.18] Because I'll.
[6754.28 → 6754.94] Oh, you got hype.
[6755.40 → 6760.00] Well, and I'm just like, like on Sancho, I don't cause my brain like switches into this
[6760.00 → 6760.26] mode.
[6760.36 → 6761.44] But when I'm playing games.
[6762.94 → 6763.88] Gaming with my bros.
[6763.98 → 6765.40] I'm in gaming with my bros mode.
[6765.40 → 6767.90] So my brain isn't like thinking like, oh yeah, don't say that.
[6768.42 → 6770.56] Um, I don't know.
[6771.38 → 6771.98] It's not great.
[6772.06 → 6773.86] It doesn't feel like a good look.
[6774.12 → 6774.98] Being able to control it better.
[6775.08 → 6778.46] What about decisions you made recently that you from 10 years ago wouldn't agree with?
[6779.10 → 6779.50] Um.
[6783.78 → 6785.10] Decisions I made recently.
[6785.26 → 6787.96] I feel like I'm going to twist this and go with like observations.
[6787.96 → 6793.42] I think 10 years ago, having self-recognition that there's like really cool things about
[6793.42 → 6798.18] being a what feel, I now understand we're barely out of small, but what feels like huge
[6798.18 → 6798.58] company.
[6799.06 → 6801.70] Um, there are like benefits to it.
[6801.70 → 6802.54] You were like adamantly.
[6802.82 → 6803.14] Oh yeah.
[6803.54 → 6805.66] Against like angry about growth sometimes.
[6805.80 → 6806.92] There are still parts about it.
[6806.98 → 6807.58] I do not like.
[6807.66 → 6808.30] Oh, a hundred percent.
[6808.32 → 6808.70] Um.
[6808.96 → 6809.56] A hundred percent.
[6809.56 → 6814.76] And I think I probably do feel strongly, more strongly about that than most people here.
[6815.36 → 6822.24] Um, but there are more things that I do like about it than I would have expected for sure.
[6822.24 → 6830.40] Um, and certain of my decisions have contributed to leading us down a path of continued expansion
[6830.40 → 6830.96] over time.
[6831.54 → 6837.62] Um, so like that would be very surprising for me, I think.
[6839.56 → 6843.80] Hey Linus, I remember you mentioned a while back that you wanted to make more women's
[6843.80 → 6846.70] clothing and was wondering if an LDD skirt was in the pipeline.
[6847.38 → 6848.58] Not that I'm aware of.
[6848.70 → 6853.96] I've also got some other merch messages, uh, about women's clothing in general and if it's
[6853.96 → 6855.98] not selling well and if you're planning to do more at all.
[6856.90 → 6858.98] Uh, no, it hasn't sold particularly well.
[6859.06 → 6863.82] I don't think we've lost money, but I think overall we have not made any money on it.
[6863.82 → 6869.94] So there's a, a significant opportunity cost there when our team is working hard and building
[6869.94 → 6872.02] what I believe are perfect products.
[6872.02 → 6875.54] Like our, our women's clothing was perfect.
[6876.12 → 6877.62] Um, and it's not selling.
[6877.62 → 6881.56] I mean, that just, um, it's, it's discouraging across the board, right?
[6881.56 → 6886.26] Both for the bean counters and for the people that pour, you know, you got to think about
[6886.26 → 6886.46] it, right?
[6886.46 → 6890.72] Like they pour their life, you know, into what they create.
[6891.30 → 6894.22] Um, we, we take that kind of thing really seriously.
[6894.22 → 6896.34] We don't want to, we don't want to waste our time.
[6896.34 → 6896.60] Right.
[6897.00 → 6901.08] And so if we're, if we're making something really great and ultimately, you know, it's
[6901.08 → 6905.12] not, it's not resonating, you know, it's not resonating enough, then we'd rather create
[6905.12 → 6907.92] something that makes, you know, more people really happy.
[6908.00 → 6909.40] It's, it's just, it's a natural thing.
[6909.40 → 6914.82] And whether that's, you know, whether that's right or not, you know, yeah, we could, we could
[6914.82 → 6916.92] debate about that till the cows come home.
[6916.96 → 6919.58] But at the end of the day, like think about your own dopamine hit, right?
[6919.62 → 6922.82] Like if you post something on Reddit, and it gets four upvotes, or you post something on
[6922.82 → 6925.40] Reddit, it gets 40,000 upvotes, which one makes you feel better?
[6927.70 → 6932.88] So yeah, I, I still want to, you know, try to support it as best we can, but it's just
[6932.88 → 6935.58] not really, it's not really flying as it is right now.
[6937.94 → 6943.08] Hey, Linus Slick and who again, if you had to choose whether to turn off the taps for
[6943.08 → 6947.00] hardware or software development forever, which would you choose?
[6947.40 → 6948.50] Thanks for keeping it positive.
[6948.50 → 6953.50] You guys in the context where you say hardware and software, it really makes it sound like
[6953.50 → 6959.44] you're talking about electronics hardware, in which case to your knowledge, we aren't
[6959.44 → 6960.32] doing any of that.
[6961.18 → 6963.58] And we certainly can't turn off software development.
[6964.16 → 6966.78] I don't think he means like a company, you know, in general.
[6967.90 → 6971.30] Oh, I think this is more like a, Oh, but I traditional.
[6971.30 → 6976.58] I'd rather have all the hardware we have today forever and continue seeing software develop.
[6976.76 → 6978.74] You find new innovative ways to use it.
[6978.78 → 6979.20] No question.
[6979.32 → 6982.80] That's not even, I mean, unless you disagree.
[6983.06 → 6983.30] Hit me.
[6983.44 → 6983.56] No.
[6983.64 → 6984.22] Yeah, I think so.
[6984.34 → 6984.64] I guess.
[6984.68 → 6989.46] Like really, do you want to play all the same games that you play today on like faster and
[6989.46 → 6990.18] faster hardware?
[6990.28 → 6992.34] They would have to optimize the games.
[6992.34 → 7000.66] I actually pitched a, I pitched a video internally today called game developers are not lazy because
[7000.66 → 7004.52] this is just a completely fucking bullshit argument.
[7005.36 → 7005.88] Yeah.
[7005.88 → 7006.18] Sorry.
[7006.26 → 7008.54] I probably shouldn't stare up my own drama.
[7008.62 → 7008.76] Dude.
[7008.82 → 7017.32] I just keep, I keep seeing people just mindlessly parrot having seemingly no understanding whatsoever
[7017.32 → 7021.80] of the actual dynamics that are at play in the games' industry.
[7022.14 → 7027.84] Even I understand just a fraction of it having never worked in it, but I understand it well
[7027.84 → 7033.44] enough to know that if a game has a problem, it almost certainly doesn't boil down to that
[7033.44 → 7036.94] every fucking developer who worked on it is a lazy fucking asshole.
[7037.40 → 7039.40] Like it's, there's, there's no way.
[7039.40 → 7040.60] Oh yeah.
[7040.74 → 7046.92] Needle in chat says, uh, as a backend developer can confirm everything I do takes 0.001 seconds.
[7047.06 → 7047.18] Yeah.
[7047.52 → 7048.04] Slash S.
[7048.30 → 7048.66] No.
[7049.02 → 7049.92] Like, come on.
[7049.96 → 7050.26] He's very serious.
[7050.26 → 7050.86] He's very serious.
[7050.86 → 7051.16] He's very serious.
[7051.16 → 7051.28] He's very serious.
[7051.28 → 7051.40] He's very serious.
[7051.40 → 7051.42] He's very serious.
[7051.42 → 7051.44] He's very serious.
[7051.44 → 7051.46] He's very serious.
[7051.46 → 7051.48] He's very serious.
[7051.48 → 7052.00] He's very serious.
[7053.10 → 7054.92] Gerald says, what about spaghetti code?
[7055.32 → 7057.74] There are organizational issues.
[7057.94 → 7059.80] There are workflow issues.
[7060.08 → 7061.40] There are management issues.
[7061.40 → 7061.42] Tech debt.
[7061.42 → 7062.00] Workforce issues.
[7062.30 → 7065.40] There are tons of issues that can lead to sloppy work.
[7065.50 → 7066.06] And you know what?
[7066.06 → 7071.78] Sometimes it's because a developer is an absolute, just complete fucking idiot and sucks.
[7071.90 → 7072.28] True.
[7072.42 → 7075.98] And they, and they should not be doing that job and they, and they totally suck.
[7076.30 → 7082.30] I would hazard a guess that that is overwhelmingly rare.
[7082.40 → 7087.14] There's also people that aren't really developers that somehow, you know, fumble their way through
[7087.14 → 7088.60] managing to make a game.
[7088.76 → 7088.94] Yeah.
[7089.00 → 7090.10] But the game is good.
[7090.22 → 7090.44] Yeah.
[7090.58 → 7092.54] It might just be like coded terribly.
[7093.54 → 7095.90] Undertake famously is like,
[7096.06 → 7098.02] 10,000 nested ifs.
[7098.12 → 7098.74] It's crazy.
[7098.82 → 7099.84] It's actually bonkers.
[7099.86 → 7101.54] But incredibly famous game.
[7101.68 → 7101.80] Yeah.
[7101.80 → 7102.50] Super successful.
[7102.60 → 7103.14] People love it.
[7103.22 → 7104.10] It's made by artists.
[7104.36 → 7105.16] They're making art.
[7105.58 → 7105.78] Yeah.
[7105.94 → 7106.60] So it's like, who cares?
[7106.78 → 7110.44] So yeah, maybe, maybe they do need ray tracing to actually get it to function the way that
[7110.44 → 7110.48] they want.
[7110.48 → 7112.42] Maybe don't worry about the, the elitism so much.
[7112.72 → 7112.88] Yeah.
[7112.88 → 7113.50] Is the game fun?
[7114.46 → 7115.26] Just make fun games.
[7115.32 → 7115.98] Is the game fun?
[7116.06 → 7116.94] I want that as a tattoo.
[7117.48 → 7120.26] If the game not fun, then who cares anyway?
[7120.90 → 7122.70] Who cares if it's spaghetti goat if the game's not fun?
[7122.70 → 7123.00] Yeah.
[7124.26 → 7125.22] Par asocial friends.
[7125.48 → 7127.88] Linus, I see you on Reddit often.
[7128.16 → 7132.58] Which social platforms do you all like or use regularly versus just having them for work?
[7132.64 → 7133.80] Oh, like in usage.
[7134.12 → 7134.40] Okay.
[7134.82 → 7135.60] I thought he meant.
[7136.44 → 7137.66] I was like, yup.
[7137.66 → 7138.66] Shit.
[7140.88 → 7143.70] Um, I don't actually use Reddit that often.
[7143.70 → 7148.76] I've been, I've been on it a little bit lately just because it's, um, I tend to like to keep
[7148.76 → 7154.92] my finger on the pulse of, you know, what the heck is going on sometimes.
[7154.92 → 7160.94] Um, as for social platforms that I use, man, I barely touch Twitter these days.
[7160.94 → 7168.16] I use Facebook almost exclusively to, uh, you know, just look at user comments on, um,
[7168.16 → 7171.82] smash champs and to just browse marketplace.
[7171.82 → 7174.00] Because I just, I think marketplace is hilarious.
[7174.00 → 7175.26] It's full of so much crazy stuff.
[7175.96 → 7178.26] I, I almost never opened TikTok.
[7179.08 → 7182.86] Um, I use YouTube, obviously.
[7184.78 → 7185.70] I don't know, man.
[7185.70 → 7189.36] I'm just, I'm, um, I don't, I don't have a lot of time for it.
[7189.36 → 7190.66] I like, I read the news.
[7190.74 → 7192.76] That's one of my, that's one of my vices.
[7192.98 → 7195.96] Like I'll, I'll just get like buried in like reading articles and stuff.
[7196.02 → 7200.10] That's my like doom-scrolling, but I, I don't prefer video.
[7200.26 → 7204.28] I've talked about this so much over the years, in spite of the fact that I'm literally a video
[7204.28 → 7208.34] creator for a living, it is not my preferred method of digesting information.
[7209.00 → 7211.54] Um, and that's still true today.
[7214.32 → 7215.40] Hello, LLD.
[7215.50 → 7216.98] Oh, well, no one else answered that question.
[7216.98 → 7220.18] Luke, are you guys just trying to get me out of here?
[7220.20 → 7220.94] Cause my mouth is sore.
[7221.00 → 7221.22] I'm good.
[7222.48 → 7223.40] What was the question?
[7223.66 → 7225.20] What social platforms do you use?
[7226.00 → 7227.44] I know you use outside of work.
[7227.68 → 7227.92] Yeah.
[7228.28 → 7233.84] Oh, uh, most of them are begrudgingly YouTube.
[7233.94 → 7234.98] I like YouTube.
[7235.06 → 7241.06] I like, um, the one thing I don't like about YouTube right now is I don't know what's going
[7241.06 → 7246.16] on with my phone, but it'll get in this thing where every time I unlock my phone, if YouTube
[7246.16 → 7251.00] is one of the things that is open, not even if it's the most previous one that was open,
[7251.06 → 7254.92] if it's one of the things that will open the second I unlock the phone, it will bring it
[7254.92 → 7255.40] to front.
[7255.76 → 7255.98] Nice.
[7256.28 → 7261.18] And it will bring a short up nice and start playing it.
[7261.52 → 7261.78] Wow.
[7263.00 → 7264.72] That should actually be illegal.
[7264.86 → 7266.20] I wasn't watching shorts.
[7266.44 → 7268.00] YouTube was not the most recent.
[7268.00 → 7269.62] Can we ban dark patterns like that?
[7269.72 → 7271.04] What the heck is going on?
[7271.32 → 7274.04] I don't know if this is a specific, like, I don't know.
[7274.20 → 7276.12] I'm only the one having this problem thing.
[7276.14 → 7276.46] I haven't seen it.
[7276.58 → 7277.52] I have no idea.
[7277.94 → 7281.00] Um, but that's been happening to me a bunch and it's been really annoying.
[7281.44 → 7283.22] Um, I've also had situation.
[7283.38 → 7283.52] Yeah.
[7283.56 → 7283.86] I don't know.
[7283.88 → 7284.74] I've had stuff like that.
[7284.78 → 7288.50] So it's very frustrating, but, um, I do generally like YouTube.
[7288.78 → 7290.96] Um, I begrudgingly use Twitter.
[7290.96 → 7291.96] People are saying they've seen it.
[7292.40 → 7292.68] Yeah.
[7292.82 → 7293.32] Same issue.
[7293.46 → 7293.58] Yeah.
[7293.66 → 7296.36] I don't know what that is, but that's really annoying.
[7296.36 → 7300.96] Especially when like, if I'm out in public, and it starts randomly playing some short
[7300.96 → 7303.16] of some dude like screaming something, like I don't.
[7303.52 → 7304.32] That's wild.
[7304.54 → 7305.06] What do you mean?
[7305.12 → 7306.86] Like, I don't want this to happen right now.
[7307.14 → 7309.94] Uh, anyway, um, I begrudgingly use Twitter.
[7310.06 → 7311.46] I begrudgingly use Facebook.
[7311.52 → 7314.86] There's like, you know, old high school contacts, family members, stuff like that.
[7315.00 → 7315.96] Facebook is the new phone book.
[7316.54 → 7316.80] Yep.
[7317.00 → 7317.18] Yeah.
[7317.24 → 7318.60] Especially like extended family.
[7318.84 → 7320.46] Like, like there is no white pages anymore.
[7320.46 → 7323.36] So what the heck am I supposed to do if I need to like contact somebody?
[7323.36 → 7327.02] If I'm messaging you one time every five years, it's probably on Facebook.
[7327.02 → 7334.60] Um, I have like most of the annoying text messaging apps because everybody has their favourite flavour.
[7335.24 → 7341.82] Um, discord and YouTube are probably the only ones that I'm like fairly happily using.
[7341.82 → 7342.24] Okay.
[7342.62 → 7342.86] Yeah.
[7345.68 → 7348.76] Hello, LLD with NVIDIA's showcase at CES.
[7348.88 → 7353.26] Do you ever think that LDT will ever integrate robots into the staff?
[7353.44 → 7353.94] And if so, how?
[7354.32 → 7355.50] Ever is a big word.
[7356.12 → 7357.00] I mean, um.
[7357.00 → 7357.84] Ever is a massive word.
[7358.00 → 7358.42] Yeah.
[7358.58 → 7364.46] I, I have a hard time imagining a future where we would be sophisticated enough to have like, uh,
[7364.46 → 7374.76] like a digital twin version of our warehouse that are, you know, AI robots use to navigate the real one to like help Jamie lift things.
[7374.92 → 7386.58] Like it just, it feels science fiction and like comical, but you know, the flip side of that is 10 years ago, a lot of what we do today would have seemed completely out of reach.
[7386.58 → 7390.84] Like the way that LED lighting has changed the cost calculation for media production.
[7391.20 → 7393.38] Um, didn't see that one coming.
[7393.74 → 7395.58] Oh, Tynan says, depends on what you call a robot.
[7395.70 → 7396.50] That's a pretty good point.
[7396.56 → 7397.24] What about 3D printer?
[7397.42 → 7398.52] That's a very good point.
[7398.58 → 7400.02] I mean, yeah, robots are everywhere.
[7400.36 → 7401.74] What about a robot vacuum?
[7402.04 → 7402.34] Sure.
[7404.64 → 7409.52] I, oh dude, I would totally deploy robot vacuums to this place if I thought that they could actually navigate our mess.
[7409.64 → 7409.98] Oh yeah.
[7410.12 → 7413.50] Would like a standing robot just be like a CNC humanoid?
[7413.50 → 7417.08] Because technically all robots are CNC machines.
[7420.06 → 7426.92] One of my pet peeves is, is people saying just CNC instead of CNC router or CNC mill.
[7427.12 → 7431.04] It's actually a hilarious pet peeve.
[7431.26 → 7432.18] That bothers you?
[7432.42 → 7433.50] Yeah, just a little bit.
[7434.92 → 7436.12] That's your like.
[7436.44 → 7437.72] We're going to have to change his job title.
[7438.70 → 7439.90] Dan Lesser, pedant.
[7442.40 → 7443.44] He knows it too.
[7443.50 → 7446.30] It's, it's, yeah, okay, fine.
[7446.86 → 7447.58] I accept.
[7450.46 → 7452.42] Automation on Mark bench, that's a pretty good argument.
[7452.60 → 7452.80] Yeah.
[7453.38 → 7455.34] Literally a robot arm that's already deployed.
[7455.46 → 7455.56] Yeah.
[7455.66 → 7456.78] There's a bunch of stuff in labs.
[7456.90 → 7457.04] Yep.
[7457.10 → 7458.62] There are other examples other than that too.
[7458.62 → 7461.70] Hi, DLL.
[7461.70 → 7464.78] Have you seen the 3D Bench controversy?
[7465.16 → 7468.92] Interested on your thoughts about enforcing copyright after years of being so lax.
[7469.00 → 7471.04] I've only peripherally noticed it.
[7471.26 → 7472.80] It seems kind of annoying.
[7472.80 → 7480.66] So basically someone owns the copyright for the Bench model that everyone uses as their kind of benchmark for 3D printers.
[7480.66 → 7485.04] And finally someone either like, did they acquire it?
[7485.08 → 7491.66] Or they're like, finally after so many years, they're, they're enforcing it and like not letting people freely distribute it.
[7491.66 → 7492.50] Oh, the little boat?
[7492.78 → 7493.04] Yeah.
[7493.04 → 7493.32] Yeah.
[7493.72 → 7493.94] Yeah.
[7493.94 → 7496.94] And it's just like, apparently the controversy is not true.
[7497.30 → 7498.52] So there you go.
[7498.78 → 7499.08] Oh.
[7499.44 → 7500.40] It's misunderstood.
[7500.64 → 7502.30] Give me a sec to find the link, says Ry saw.
[7502.38 → 7502.86] So there you go.
[7502.88 → 7503.36] Let's just.
[7503.52 → 7506.46] My understanding is it has something to do with modifying it.
[7506.70 → 7506.98] Sure.
[7506.98 → 7508.42] And then redistributing it.
[7508.76 → 7509.00] Sure.
[7509.00 → 7510.58] Because then it's not a benchmark anymore.
[7510.70 → 7511.94] But now we have Bodhi.
[7512.08 → 7512.50] I don't know.
[7512.56 → 7513.02] Oh my God.
[7513.04 → 7513.54] Who cares?
[7513.64 → 7514.70] Because like, yeah, exactly.
[7514.82 → 7516.04] It's, it's a it's a bench.
[7517.08 → 7519.36] That is now the new benchmark called Bodhi.
[7519.62 → 7520.00] Okay.
[7520.56 → 7520.92] Sure.
[7521.88 → 7523.04] Now I need to see it.
[7523.54 → 7524.58] Of course it is.
[7528.10 → 7528.50] Bodhi.
[7529.16 → 7530.78] It's such a wonderful community.
[7531.12 → 7532.74] I love, I love all of them.
[7533.96 → 7535.06] Bodhi 3D print.
[7535.26 → 7536.36] So what am I, what am I even looking at?
[7536.40 → 7537.06] 3D Bodhi.
[7537.16 → 7537.36] Yeah.
[7537.38 → 7538.02] 3D Bodhi.
[7538.12 → 7538.52] There you go.
[7538.52 → 7538.92] Okay.
[7538.98 → 7539.70] 3D Bodhi.
[7539.82 → 7542.72] It's got the same, same sort of overhang, bridging test.
[7543.08 → 7544.00] Like, yeah.
[7544.06 → 7544.28] Okay.
[7544.90 → 7547.06] Bodhi the bench benchmark.
[7547.98 → 7548.38] All right.
[7548.62 → 7548.94] Sure.
[7549.38 → 7549.74] Yep.
[7550.50 → 7554.62] If there was anyone who was going to, if there was anyone who was going to maliciously comply
[7554.62 → 7556.86] this hard, it would be the 3D printing community.
[7556.98 → 7557.82] So good on you guys.
[7557.94 → 7559.32] That really, that makes sense.
[7559.58 → 7560.56] Artistic nerds are the best.
[7560.56 → 7561.50] That makes a lot of sense.
[7562.38 → 7562.56] Yeah.
[7562.72 → 7563.14] All right.
[7563.42 → 7564.08] Let's see.
[7564.88 → 7566.76] You should really, have you talked to,
[7566.76 → 7569.38] uh, uh, labs web, Dan?
[7570.44 → 7571.68] Uh, not really.
[7571.78 → 7572.76] Maybe just occasionally.
[7572.92 → 7574.10] You two should chat at some time.
[7574.34 → 7574.96] That would be nice.
[7575.16 → 7575.38] Yeah.
[7575.38 → 7576.96] Hi, DLL.
[7576.96 → 7580.76] Well, as someone currently watching their country burn down, are there any steps someone can
[7580.76 → 7583.62] take to prepare for moving without having a job lined up?
[7583.62 → 7585.48] Honestly, not really.
[7585.58 → 7589.92] I have people reach out all the time, like wanting to move to Canada to work at LMG.
[7590.00 → 7594.84] And every time I'm just like, yeah, I can't explain this because it seems like, especially
[7594.84 → 7598.24] over the last few years, we were importing people at a historical rate.
[7598.24 → 7602.68] I shouldn't say it seems like, because over the last few years, we've been importing people
[7602.68 → 7604.76] at an historical rate.
[7604.92 → 7610.10] And yet if I have like qualified international candidate, I have to go through all this like
[7610.10 → 7616.84] paperwork and LMA and, and yeah, I'd spend a ton of money and like freaking can't get people
[7616.84 → 7617.28] in here.
[7617.32 → 7621.50] And I'm just, I've never been able to kind of, I've never been able to kind of bridge those
[7621.50 → 7623.88] two facts in my mind.
[7623.88 → 7627.92] Um, and so whenever people reach out to me from somewhere else, I'm basically just like,
[7627.96 → 7633.90] dude, I got no idea because as someone who's already here, I have flipping no clue how to
[7633.90 → 7635.50] facilitate getting people here.
[7635.56 → 7641.52] It's, it's seemed incredibly complicated, even in some cases for people with, you know, that
[7641.52 → 7645.40] are, that are young and able to work and have decent credentials.
[7645.40 → 7647.28] And it's just like, nah, it's like, okay.
[7647.28 → 7648.84] So then just random then.
[7649.10 → 7649.64] Okay, sure.
[7649.74 → 7649.98] Fine.
[7649.98 → 7650.62] Um,
[7653.88 → 7655.88] cool.
[7657.72 → 7659.42] Hey, LLD question for Linus.
[7659.58 → 7663.22] What was it like for you during the procedure for getting your wisdom teeth removed coming
[7663.22 → 7668.30] from someone who's going to have the same procedure later this year or next?
[7668.40 → 7668.98] Couldn't tell you.
[7669.10 → 7670.18] Don't remember any of it.
[7670.58 → 7674.40] Um, I mean, really the best advice I can give you is to, you know, talk to your dental professional
[7674.40 → 7677.68] and ask them what it's going to be like, because they're going to be the ones that know
[7677.68 → 7678.74] your case the best.
[7678.74 → 7681.52] And my sample size is of two.
[7681.66 → 7683.00] I've had this procedure twice.
[7683.26 → 7684.34] Both times it was different.
[7684.44 → 7686.24] So really it's two sample sizes of one.
[7686.28 → 7688.68] If we want to be very Dan about it.
[7688.90 → 7689.98] I did the same thing.
[7690.90 → 7694.68] I had, uh, no, no, be pedantic about it.
[7694.70 → 7694.90] Yeah.
[7694.90 → 7695.28] Don't, don't.
[7695.42 → 7695.78] It's okay.
[7696.40 → 7699.82] No, what you actually meant to say was no, you're getting a ding anyway.
[7700.06 → 7700.34] All right.
[7700.34 → 7700.74] Thank you.
[7700.82 → 7702.84] Um, anyway, talk to your dental professional.
[7702.84 → 7705.94] They're going to, they're going to have the they're going to have the best insight and
[7705.94 → 7707.20] the most experienced to share with you.
[7709.80 → 7710.68] Hi, a DLL.
[7710.90 → 7716.52] What's the one most impressive thing someone has done in a non-technical job interview with
[7716.52 → 7717.10] LEG?
[7717.24 → 7720.40] I haven't interviewed anyone in like seven years, probably.
[7720.62 → 7723.40] Every single interview I've done has been a technical interview.
[7723.52 → 7723.96] Cool.
[7725.88 → 7726.40] Sorry.
[7727.34 → 7728.80] Hey, my big L's.
[7728.80 → 7734.10] I know you guys are no longer in the underwear business, but me and my fiancé love them and
[7734.10 → 7734.60] need more.
[7734.76 → 7737.42] Any brands you would give an approval for a similar fit and feel?
[7738.04 → 7739.54] Prove we're not in the underwear business.
[7739.72 → 7743.06] Uh, we've actually got new samples from a new supplier that I am.
[7743.12 → 7743.24] Yo.
[7745.70 → 7749.26] Wearing yesterday, um, that are looking really promising.
[7749.52 → 7750.42] So there you go.
[7750.56 → 7750.74] Yeah.
[7750.80 → 7751.58] Friday's long day.
[7752.54 → 7753.56] Uh, let's see.
[7753.90 → 7758.26] Hey, Linus, you sometimes use the phrase exactly one for emphasis.
[7758.26 → 7760.30] Is that a reference to something or did you make it up?
[7760.30 → 7767.00] Uh, it's kind of inspired by John Cleese's character in Faulty Towers when he like puts
[7767.00 → 7770.30] on a German accent when he's talking to the Germans that stay in the hotel.
[7770.94 → 7772.76] Uh, it's, I don't know.
[7772.82 → 7777.28] I just think it's funny, you know, precision in German-ness.
[7778.80 → 7779.80] What exactly?
[7779.92 → 7780.20] What?
[7781.24 → 7787.94] My homeland got hit by ransomware last week and I lost terabytes of raw video and photos.
[7787.94 → 7789.18] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
[7789.42 → 7794.76] Any advice on possibly, on the possibility of data recovery, cleanup and future security
[7794.76 → 7795.50] enhancement?
[7796.92 → 7800.56] I mean, at the end of the day, data safety comes down to three, two, one, right?
[7800.60 → 7802.74] Like three copies in at least two locations.
[7803.14 → 7804.30] Um, bloody hell.
[7804.34 → 7804.90] What's the one?
[7805.10 → 7805.48] Hit me.
[7807.12 → 7809.06] One offsite, two formats.
[7810.52 → 7811.80] One offsite, two formats.
[7812.58 → 7812.94] Yeah.
[7813.02 → 7813.52] One offsite.
[7813.52 → 7814.16] Three versions.
[7814.34 → 7814.44] Yeah.
[7814.64 → 7814.86] Yeah.
[7815.72 → 7817.50] Um, yeah.
[7817.50 → 7821.78] As for recovery, man, that's a challenge, right?
[7821.82 → 7828.56] Cause there are lots of smaller recovery places that, uh, might do a great job, or they might
[7828.56 → 7829.84] be a fly-by-night loser.
[7829.84 → 7831.50] That's going to do more damage than good.
[7831.86 → 7837.28] There are like, you know, your reputable data recovery guys, but I, I promise you even
[7837.28 → 7838.92] they could end up doing more damage than good.
[7838.98 → 7839.80] So that's number one.
[7839.80 → 7847.26] And then number two is you will pay unless that footage is like, you know, of the orchestration
[7847.26 → 7851.92] of the JFK assassination or something like you're going to pay more for it to recover
[7851.92 → 7853.18] it than it is worth.
[7854.00 → 7860.32] Um, other than just, you know, saying I, I, I get it, and I've gone through data loss before
[7860.32 → 7861.64] and it really sucks.
[7861.72 → 7863.74] There's not really a lot that I can offer you.
[7863.74 → 7870.24] Um, that blows, um, you know, obviously I made that investment into hex OS, um, to make
[7870.24 → 7876.20] it hopefully easier for kind of techie people, but not necessarily, you know, networking command
[7876.20 → 7882.06] line people to, um, to have like a buddy backup and cloud backups enabled really easily on
[7882.06 → 7882.74] DIY hardware.
[7882.74 → 7885.64] But, uh, that particular feature is not rolled out yet.
[7885.96 → 7889.18] Hopefully I'll have exciting news to share in the future, but for now, not much.
[7890.42 → 7890.78] Yeah.
[7890.82 → 7894.08] I take my most important files to the cloud nightly.
[7895.90 → 7896.84] Uh, let's see.
[7896.90 → 7898.24] What else do we have here?
[7898.78 → 7901.98] Hey, JLL, how is the glow in the dark holding up on the RICAN?
[7902.36 → 7905.10] Is it just as strong as when the wrap was first applied?
[7905.34 → 7907.12] How long does brand expect it to last?
[7907.80 → 7912.20] It should last as long as pretty much any glow in the dark thing that you have, which is to
[7912.20 → 7916.02] say that I believe the effect does fade a little bit over time, but no, it still works
[7916.02 → 7916.46] pretty good.
[7917.00 → 7918.18] Do you still charge it?
[7918.22 → 7919.14] Like when you leave your house?
[7919.28 → 7922.46] No, that was, that was really cool and fun project.
[7922.46 → 7926.42] And like, it looks really cool when you first pull out of the garage, but realistically there's
[7926.42 → 7932.98] enough, um, if I was somewhere else, it would be super cool, but there's enough light in my
[7932.98 → 7937.36] area that within probably like five minutes, you can't make it out too well anyway.
[7937.36 → 7940.10] So I was like, okay, well, this is kind of an obstacle in my garage.
[7940.22 → 7940.34] Right.
[7940.34 → 7943.34] And besides I have some other cool plans for those black lights.
[7943.84 → 7949.04] Um, I want to take them to smash champs and set them up in the lighting grid or not grid,
[7949.14 → 7951.36] but, uh, in the, in the side lights for the courts.
[7951.36 → 7955.38] And I want to do like disco badminton, you know, like disco bowling.
[7955.60 → 7960.36] So yeah, the, the nylon shuttles do fluoresce, at least the Yonex ones do.
[7961.10 → 7961.92] Oh, sick.
[7961.92 → 7971.62] So if we could maybe put a fluorescing top transparent coat over the court lines, uh, the tape on the, on the nets also fluoresces already.
[7971.88 → 7975.06] So that could be freaking cool.
[7975.26 → 7975.78] That's sweet.
[7975.82 → 7980.88] It's not the kind of thing we'd do all the time, but it's like, like once a quarter or something, doing like disco badminton night or something.
[7980.92 → 7982.10] I think people would come out for that.
[7982.10 → 7982.54] Yeah.
[7982.54 → 7982.90] Yeah.
[7983.06 → 7984.46] I suspect it would be pretty popular.
[7984.58 → 7985.64] You might be able to do it more often than that.
[7985.64 → 7992.50] And then I would do it over on the LAN party side so that if we wanted to switch out the house lights and turn on all black lights for the LAN, then we could.
[7993.92 → 7995.16] Which I think would be pretty cool.
[7995.24 → 7995.78] That's pretty cool.
[7995.94 → 7996.10] Yeah.
[7996.10 → 7996.54] Yeah.
[7996.96 → 7998.72] Get some Chavez hex bars in there.
[7998.78 → 7999.28] It'll be fun.
[8000.40 → 8001.90] Uh, I've got a couple more.
[8002.16 → 8002.42] Yeah.
[8002.96 → 8003.42] I've got a couple.
[8003.42 → 8004.64] I assume that's a really cool light.
[8005.22 → 8005.46] Yeah.
[8005.50 → 8008.74] They're like the moving head things, and they swing about in clubs and stuff.
[8009.42 → 8010.16] Hi, LLD.
[8010.32 → 8013.30] First time buying from LTT since I started watching you in 2020.
[8013.62 → 8016.12] I'll be travelling for the first time to Tokyo.
[8016.58 → 8019.94] What would be your must-see shops or sites and favourite meal and drink?
[8019.94 → 8030.70] Ooh, uh, it's not in Tokyo, but my highlight for sure was when we took the Shinkansen to, um, the deer park in, uh, some, ugh.
[8031.56 → 8031.82] Okay.
[8032.44 → 8036.94] When I travel with my family, I'm not really like a travel guy.
[8037.06 → 8042.66] I'm just there to, like, help wrangle kids and make life less stressful for everyone else.
[8043.00 → 8043.66] People are saying Nara.
[8043.94 → 8044.78] I do, yeah, Nara.
[8045.10 → 8046.00] Uh, I do whatever.
[8046.72 → 8049.92] Um, so I just, like, I go where I'm told to go.
[8050.24 → 8051.98] And do what I'm told to do.
[8052.28 → 8057.14] And, uh, you know, Yvonne and the kids, they, like, do lots of cool stuff.
[8057.16 → 8058.06] And that's super cool.
[8058.68 → 8060.74] But, uh, Nara was, Nara was really great.
[8061.08 → 8061.96] So that was really cool.
[8062.96 → 8068.36] Um, I'm sure you'll get lots of great recommendations, by the way, in, you know, the float plane chat.
[8068.36 → 8072.62] But in terms of, of my recommendations, I, uh, yeah, sure.
[8072.70 → 8073.02] Deer Park.
[8073.44 → 8073.96] It's pretty sick.
[8075.06 → 8076.78] Not in Tokyo, so sorry about that.
[8076.78 → 8081.58] But the, uh, the Mario Kart, um, you know, go-karts on the street thing is overrated.
[8082.26 → 8083.04] I'll say that.
[8083.58 → 8085.36] Yeah, I kind of always assumed that.
[8085.50 → 8087.40] Yeah, just, whatever, I'm here.
[8087.70 → 8088.06] Yeah, sure.
[8088.32 → 8088.48] Yeah.
[8088.48 → 8093.32] Hey, Tech Napoleon, Cafetière, and I guess Dan.
[8093.96 → 8097.50] Linus, what's the last video you've fully written, which wasn't a challenge video?
[8097.74 → 8100.96] Also, what are a few projects or videos you've cancelled?
[8101.66 → 8103.10] Last video of fully written?
[8103.64 → 8105.32] Um, oh, I don't know.
[8105.44 → 8106.30] Cancelled projects.
[8106.66 → 8108.20] I cancel things all the time.
[8108.94 → 8111.88] Uh, I, I honestly do not remember.
[8112.00 → 8115.72] It's going to be a lot easier for me to try and figure out this, uh, last thing I've written
[8115.72 → 8116.00] one.
[8118.28 → 8119.72] Uh, oh, no, not title contains.
[8119.80 → 8121.28] Why don't you have Luke do one in the meantime?
[8121.62 → 8125.78] And then I can, I can try and bring up a list of videos.
[8125.92 → 8126.50] There's only one left.
[8126.80 → 8127.26] Only one left.
[8127.26 → 8132.26] Hey, DLL, I broke a $4,000 printer at work due to poor documentation from the manufacturer.
[8132.54 → 8135.14] Are there any things you broke or damaged because of this?
[8135.14 → 8147.08] No, but what I can say is that, uh, we at Float plane, um, as in, I think actually most
[8147.08 → 8151.58] of the teams at this point have found and corrected software documentation for other
[8151.58 → 8152.38] companies before.
[8152.88 → 8159.70] Um, I can think of honestly quite a few right off the top of my head where we'll be like,
[8159.76 → 8161.00] Hey, this thing doesn't work.
[8161.06 → 8162.54] We're following your documentation.
[8162.82 → 8163.94] Here's all the details.
[8163.94 → 8168.06] We think it's like maybe this other way, and they'll get back to us and be like, Oh, that
[8168.06 → 8168.98] documentation is wrong.
[8169.44 → 8169.80] Cool.
[8170.34 → 8171.34] Here's the stuff.
[8171.48 → 8171.68] Cool.
[8172.06 → 8173.08] It's like, Oh, cool.
[8173.26 → 8173.38] Cool.
[8173.38 → 8173.46] Cool.
[8173.46 → 8175.72] I'm so happy we spent all that time trying to figure that out.
[8177.18 → 8183.22] Turns out even massive multi-billion dollar companies make mistakes.
[8183.38 → 8183.66] They do.
[8184.12 → 8184.46] They do.
[8184.52 → 8188.20] Cause it turns out they're staffed by people and people are, they do their best for the
[8188.20 → 8188.82] most part, I think.
[8189.00 → 8189.76] For the most part.
[8189.76 → 8192.28] Um, there was one that I accidentally archived.
[8192.36 → 8197.62] It was something about, um, uh, how to help people like to set up parental controls and stuff.
[8197.66 → 8200.52] And honestly, the best advice I can give you is stay out of it.
[8201.16 → 8202.44] Let them figure out their stuff.
[8202.48 → 8206.20] And if they're not willing to put in the work, then you shouldn't be giving them tech support
[8206.20 → 8207.70] on how to manage parental controls.
[8207.70 → 8211.70] Because at the best of times, they're an absolute cluster bomb.
[8211.86 → 8212.82] They are terrible.
[8213.30 → 8218.22] Um, I still remember spending like an hour trying to figure out how to join a Minecraft
[8218.22 → 8223.28] dungeons game with my kids in spite of the fact, because they're minors, and I'm not in
[8223.28 → 8226.94] spite of the fact that I am literally set up as the parent in our family unit.
[8228.28 → 8229.74] You'd think that would allow it.
[8229.86 → 8230.76] So annoying.
[8231.76 → 8232.94] Um, okay.
[8233.02 → 8236.10] So yeah, let me, let me get back to, let me get back to your question.
[8236.28 → 8239.54] So here's our dashboard, uh, celebrity tech scam.
[8239.64 → 8241.74] That's Alex, uh, Nintendo Switch two.
[8241.86 → 8243.74] That's David $20,000 server.
[8243.90 → 8246.52] That's Jake ray tracing is mandatory now.
[8246.58 → 8250.20] Oh, that was a that was a team effort, but I think it was Adam that got it across the
[8250.20 → 8250.54] line.
[8250.72 → 8252.62] Uh, every RTX 5090 at CES.
[8252.62 → 8253.44] That was collaborative.
[8253.70 → 8255.28] My new TV sucks again.
[8255.36 → 8259.56] This was written by me and Alex's sections were written by him with a little bit of me kind
[8259.56 → 8261.16] of laying out which beats I wanted.
[8261.78 → 8263.18] Uh, unreleased AMD thing.
[8263.26 → 8266.12] That was me first to game on the RTX 5090.
[8266.30 → 8267.12] That was me.
[8267.54 → 8270.56] I've never been this angry and confused before.
[8270.74 → 8272.72] This was, who did this one?
[8273.70 → 8276.26] Uh, I believe this might, oh, this was proof.
[8277.12 → 8277.62] Uh, SteamOS.
[8277.72 → 8279.38] This was, um, Jordan.
[8280.36 → 8287.22] So let's see, let's find a not, let's find a not CES content piece that I wrote start to
[8287.22 → 8287.62] finish.
[8288.60 → 8290.36] So I'm on the tablet.
[8290.52 → 8291.86] I threw a gaming thing.
[8292.50 → 8295.74] We have a we have a really talented writing team and they, they do a lot.
[8296.26 → 8299.10] Uh, AMD upgrades are very, uh, ad lib.
[8299.46 → 8305.02] So you could kind of think of those as being largely kind of written by me, but also like
[8305.02 → 8307.92] not really, not really written in that sense.
[8308.26 → 8314.04] Uh, this I wrote a lot for, I wrote a ton of notes because I was the tester for the project.
[8314.04 → 8319.66] Um, and Jordan used some of my notes verbatim in the final script, but ultimately he was
[8319.66 → 8324.14] kind of tasked with, uh, operating in the role to kind of get it over the board.
[8325.82 → 8328.38] Um, yeah, let's see.
[8328.80 → 8331.00] I, uh, I think probably the last one.
[8331.10 → 8332.68] Oh, brand.
[8332.86 → 8333.20] I don't know.
[8335.10 → 8339.32] Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, very, again, very like kind of written by me in the sense that
[8339.32 → 8344.06] I was there, uh, Jake did a great job of the, the hex OS reveal.
[8345.28 → 8351.80] I think probably the last one that I wrote start to finish would have been the, um, Equinix
[8351.80 → 8352.38] tour.
[8354.94 → 8355.34] Yeah.
[8355.70 → 8357.68] Let's go with, let's go with Equinix tour.
[8357.74 → 8358.28] Yeah, there it is.
[8358.50 → 8365.94] So this one, I basically got briefed by them, um, wrote it, hosted it, and then came home.
[8366.32 → 8366.72] Okay.
[8369.32 → 8370.36] That's all I got?
[8371.42 → 8372.74] No, that's all I got.
[8373.20 → 8374.10] That's all I got too.
[8374.76 → 8375.12] Yeah.
[8376.28 → 8377.14] That's all we got.
[8377.30 → 8377.96] That's all we got.
[8379.28 → 8381.98] Hopefully next week is a little less ridiculous.
[8382.78 → 8383.30] What are the odds?
[8385.46 → 8388.22] Uh, I think most betting sites would not say favourable.
[8388.60 → 8388.78] Hmm.
[8389.26 → 8389.88] 40 to 1.
[8390.26 → 8390.66] Interesting.
[8391.22 → 8392.20] What about the Magic 8-ball?
[8392.32 → 8393.42] What does the Magic 8-ball say?
[8394.10 → 8396.22] Is there, there's got to be a web Magic 8-ball.
[8397.54 → 8398.50] Magic 8-ball, come on.
[8398.78 → 8399.22] Here we go.
[8399.94 → 8400.66] Ask the 8-ball.
[8401.40 → 8401.98] Here we go.
[8402.36 → 8403.32] What is your question?
[8404.62 → 8404.90] Uh.
[8405.14 → 8406.22] You don't have to type it, do we?
[8406.48 → 8407.76] No, you just, you just ask it.
[8407.76 → 8409.50] Oh, look at the ads on this site.
[8409.62 → 8410.12] Good Lord.
[8410.44 → 8410.80] Wow.
[8411.28 → 8411.68] Okay.
[8411.78 → 8412.60] So hold on.
[8412.78 → 8413.68] You just, oh, okay.
