[0.00 --> 7.86]  What's up everybody and welcome to the WAN show we've got a great show lined up for you guys
[7.86 --> 15.84]  Apple really really wants you to see F1 the movie so much so that they would become
[15.84 --> 24.44]  everything they sought to destroy what was the title today I don't even oh yeah right
[24.44 --> 32.84]  right the whole um how is this so controversy stop killing games controversial yeah you know
[32.84 --> 38.04]  how is this so controversy stop killing games well we'll get to that but stop killing games
[38.04 --> 48.56]  is a thing maybe or maybe it won't be or maybe it is what an intro to a topic
[48.56 --> 56.16]  it's not an intro to a topic it's an intro to the show right we'd hate to misrepresent this and have
[56.16 --> 62.34]  people who are just tuning in for the first time think that this is a hinged show ah yes correct no
[62.34 --> 69.94]  hinges speaking of hinged microsoft i'm removing this oh oh from our laptop partner dell you can't
[69.94 --> 70.78]  it's too well built
[70.78 --> 73.78]  my god
[73.78 --> 82.48]  ah ah uh microsoft has free option to windows 10 to extend security updates program why does it say
[82.48 --> 88.24]  free it's definitely not free isn't it you're free what uh we'll talk about that later uh cloudflare
[88.24 --> 93.88]  is changing the rules of the internet changing the rules for the better that's right are they changing
[93.88 --> 95.36]  rule 34 probably not
[95.36 --> 122.48]  the show is brought to you today by delete me zero bounce and amd and of course our rap partner dbrand
[122.48 --> 127.52]  our chair partner secret lab and dell already got a shout out they had enough they did they did
[127.52 --> 133.18]  leaning i was showing the logo stop killing games the wrong way so i was trying to do it right stop
[133.18 --> 140.98]  killing games did it but don't stop now unless what you want to stop is stop killing games you sound
[140.98 --> 151.58]  like a town crier i am the crier i was on two and a half men you know my name's john what it's the
[151.58 --> 158.86]  actor's name john cry oh wow all right stop killing games the initiative to save games from
[158.86 --> 165.76]  dying at the hands of their makers because usually developers stop making money on it and they're like
[165.76 --> 172.90]  hmm see ya we architected this to only work if our servers are online and now they're not so i guess um
[172.90 --> 179.72]  it's too bad see you later it has crossed the one million signatures it needed to get the attention
[179.72 --> 185.32]  of the eu commission which gives it a much higher chance to pass a law which could force developers
[185.32 --> 193.24]  to sunset their games properly now luke and i have given our thoughts on what proper sun setting of
[193.24 --> 199.58]  games would look like and some really good examples we've also given some examples of how
[199.58 --> 206.48]  in some cases it might not actually work that great it could be quite challenging whether it's
[206.48 --> 213.14]  around third-party licensing of say for example music or other media that's included in the game
[213.14 --> 222.38]  or whether it's around um ip that is used across multiple uh multiple products that could potentially
[222.38 --> 228.44]  harm the security of those other products or you know there are potential reasons that just you know
[228.44 --> 233.52]  putting out the source code of a particular game or putting the servers into the hands of the players
[233.52 --> 240.80]  might be really challenging but that's what stop killing games is seeking to change is to make them
[240.80 --> 248.04]  architect these games from the ground up to comply with their obligation to make the game available
[248.04 --> 256.14]  after they no longer wish to support it whether that is in the hands of another entity or the gamers
[256.14 --> 264.50]  themselves anyway the petition is not over they want as many signatures as possible because the more
[264.50 --> 270.36]  signatures they get the better they can show interest in the movement and it will also help in case some
[270.36 --> 276.76]  signatures are invalid for whatever reason given that this has gotten global attention i don't doubt that
[276.76 --> 285.28]  a significant portion of those 1 million signatures are probably not from the eu yeah there's there's a big push for
[285.28 --> 291.22]  for questioning not only may they not be from the eu but there's some questioning of if it was like
[291.22 --> 296.74]  botted to go higher with the intention of hoping that people would slow down once it passed its mark
[296.74 --> 305.84]  so there's there's a lot of questions going on uh in other news because they have no sense of
[305.84 --> 313.58]  i don't know irony uh ea has announced that anthems servers will be shutting down on january 12th
[313.58 --> 323.02]  2026 and that the game will be removed from ea play on august 15th 2025 um man there was some other
[323.02 --> 328.04]  terrible games industry news but i guess none of it had to do with games that were actually released
[328.04 --> 334.02]  you see microsoft killed a whole bunch of jobs again no i didn't yeah including some games that
[334.02 --> 340.16]  apparently were so promising that like microsoft executives had to have the controllers like
[340.16 --> 345.78]  taken out of their hands when they were play testing it like and now it's dead anyway so if
[345.78 --> 351.86]  you're from the eu head over to stopkillinggames.com and sign the petition because while this only
[351.86 --> 357.88]  affects the eu ruling it is quite possible nay probable that it will have a larger impact outside
[357.88 --> 363.60]  of the eu as well because if they already have to do all of the work to architect their game so that
[363.60 --> 370.38]  it could be um tied up into a nice little bow and then hand it off once they no longer feel like
[370.38 --> 377.22]  supporting it then i pretty much guarantee you that that would have a positive impact for players in
[377.22 --> 383.08]  other countries as well other continents excuse me sorry sorry eu is not a country um there's also a
[383.08 --> 388.76]  uk specific version of the petition on the same site if you scroll down a bit this has also reached
[388.76 --> 396.48]  the 100 000 signatures needed but couldn't always use more so our discussion question here is can you
[396.48 --> 403.28]  brainstorm the ideal sun setting plan that developers could do to keep games alive forever is it leaving
[403.28 --> 408.86]  their servers up and running is it making it open source what's the ideal and i know my answer but i
[408.86 --> 414.16]  want to hear your answer yeah i don't think leaving their servers up forever is going to function to be it's
[414.16 --> 420.16]  it's not gonna no no that's not gonna work you can't you can't just legislate companies losing money
[420.16 --> 424.30]  because eventually maintenance on things that are losing money yeah that's that's not gonna work
[424.30 --> 429.90]  yeah but that doesn't mean that this is impossible or an unreasonable expectation for products that we
[429.90 --> 436.78]  buy right like these aren't products that are even sold to us necessarily as as a as a subscription
[436.78 --> 443.06]  service i mean they treat them like one but these are products that in many cases we we buy it's like a
[443.06 --> 448.10]  one-time transaction and you can bury terms in your end user license agreement that make it so that
[448.10 --> 454.82]  you know you're only obligated to leave it up as long as you feel like it but i think there is a certain
[454.82 --> 462.20]  expectation that when i give you a one-time payment for something say one line thank you that that is now
[462.20 --> 469.42]  your line and that i don't have a remote line kill switch that will just take your line and and get it
[469.42 --> 476.96]  out of here right like that is not what our expectation would be i think under normal circumstances
[476.96 --> 482.68]  i have pirated the lime nice open source line i like it
[482.68 --> 493.26]  i'll just put that back you whacked the tv well it still looks like it'll never prove it
[493.26 --> 496.88]  you'll never prove it the camera didn't see anything
[496.88 --> 502.72]  um yeah i don't know it's it's a little tough for some games um
[502.72 --> 510.14]  i don't necessarily think it's completely unsolvable because the stance that we've had
[510.14 --> 514.48]  i don't know if this perfect honestly i'm not super on top of the stop killing game stuff so i don't
[514.48 --> 519.12]  know if this perfectly aligns with theirs but the stance that we've had is that you should at least
[519.12 --> 525.60]  give the community a chance to do it yeah i'd say my ideal execution of this is forged alliance
[525.60 --> 533.28]  forever yeah supreme commander was a super cool game that i really enjoyed um i think i forget i
[533.28 --> 540.44]  forget who went down first gas powered games or thq uh but ultimately what happened is there was some
[540.44 --> 548.38]  complexity around any kind of transfer of the ip um there was some drama that went down around i think
[548.38 --> 553.40]  it was was it gas powered games that went down first you know what i really don't remember so
[553.40 --> 559.62]  it doesn't matter the point is either the publisher or the developer went bye-bye and what they ultimately
[559.62 --> 567.92]  arrived on was leaving the the matchmaking and custom map hosting and community chat and all of these
[567.92 --> 574.30]  features leaving them in the hands of the community that wanted to maintain the game and be stewards of
[574.30 --> 581.68]  the game meaning that even though it has been like 10 plus years now since that game was no longer
[581.68 --> 588.52]  actively supported by the developer you can still play it online you can play custom maps there's all
[588.52 --> 593.20]  kinds of cool mods that you can apply so they have their own like mod workshop that's built within
[593.20 --> 599.76]  the fa forever so forged alliance was the uh the expansion to supreme commander so it's forged
[599.76 --> 605.32]  alliance forever so within the forged alliance forever launcher um it handles automatic updates
[605.32 --> 613.38]  it's a little janky sure but but in a way that's honestly like i'm completely fine it's kind of cool
[613.38 --> 622.08]  it reminds me of old old style computing but it's alive it's freaking alive and the best part is the ip
[622.08 --> 628.86]  holders still get to profit from it so you have to buy they've worked out a system where you have to
[628.86 --> 635.00]  authenticate with the uh with the forged alliance forever server that you have to give it access to
[635.00 --> 640.66]  your steam library and prove that you own a copy of supreme commander or forged alliance also also
[640.66 --> 646.50]  think is fine which i think is totally fine i mean if if the company is willing to hand all these reins
[646.50 --> 652.20]  over in the way that they did then i think it's it's okay ideally they put it at a price that's like
[652.20 --> 658.48]  not yeah and it's i think it's pretty reasonable these days but the the point is just that this is a way
[658.48 --> 664.76]  that the players continue to win by being allowed to play the game and the publisher and or developer
[664.76 --> 670.56]  depending on whatever their revenue split looks like gets to continue to win by occasionally selling
[670.56 --> 677.34]  the game here and there that's freaking awesome you can buy it for two dollars and 79 cents right now
[677.34 --> 683.86]  that is two us dollars it's it's a great game it actually has legitimately really fun a pretty decent
[683.86 --> 688.90]  campaign like it's an rts campaign so you you know how it goes you do each level and you unlock some
[688.90 --> 694.66]  more of the tech tree and you kill all the bad guys or whatever um and i would say that the online
[694.66 --> 699.90]  can be a little daunting to get into because you'll finish that campaign and think you're a supreme
[699.90 --> 707.50]  commander god and then you'll jump in online and get absolutely curb stomped it's the this kid the skill
[707.50 --> 713.72]  ramp is insane but it has a really great built-in replay function um that allows you to watch back
[713.72 --> 719.22]  at any speed you want and like it's really quick to go through replays uh people from my experience
[719.22 --> 724.64]  have been very friendly and willing to discuss strategy so once you get a handle on some of the
[724.64 --> 731.30]  strats it's 2d seems great it it's uh it's it's pretty fun if you if you like a deep if you like a deep
[731.30 --> 739.88]  rts and it has the best the best top-down interface that has ever existed for a game
[739.88 --> 747.24]  i will stand behind that the strategic zoom is outstanding it's very easy to get around the map
[747.24 --> 753.32]  with a mouse wheel you you basically you don't you don't move the cursor to the edge of the screen
[753.32 --> 760.52]  and pan that's like dinosaur technology so you just use the mouse wheel and kind of like zooming in
[760.52 --> 766.10]  on an image in like an image editor you just kind of like zoom out and then zoom in it's like
[766.10 --> 774.36]  and then you can actually turn so you can turn your viewport into like a super zoomed in look at what
[774.36 --> 779.46]  something is doing you can like you could go to one of your factories and see the unit that's being
[779.46 --> 785.38]  like 3d printed on the bed and then you can zoom all the way out so your whole monitor is just a big
[785.38 --> 793.48]  mini map like a like a you know a not mini map but you know anyway the point is there's icons for
[793.48 --> 799.10]  little just little icons representing all the units and you can see like a whole strategic view of the
[799.10 --> 804.04]  entire battlefield it even supports multi-monitor it did back in the day anyway so you could have
[804.04 --> 809.54]  like your your giant mini map on one monitor and then your gameplay view on uh on another monitor it
[809.54 --> 816.46]  was like freaking awesome maxi map says when bingo chronified yeah exactly exactly apparently
[816.46 --> 821.80]  factorio has something similar as well strategic zoom dude huge innovation in that game absolutely
[821.80 --> 828.46]  love it so that's my that's kind of the ideal to me is like put put put the ability to keep running
[828.46 --> 833.98]  it in the hands of the community and if the community doesn't care then that's fine all right
[833.98 --> 841.40]  all right and some games will still die i would prefer the things required to be put somewhere
[841.40 --> 848.92]  some external repository that doesn't cost to maintain like a a public github or something like
[848.92 --> 855.20]  that i don't know but like put it somewhere um i don't know if this makes any sense internet archive
[855.20 --> 859.82]  it something do do something so that you never have to look at it again because honestly if the company
[859.82 --> 864.92]  doesn't ever want to look at it again i think that's completely fine um also don't take it back
[864.92 --> 872.12]  if you have given it up to the community and then they find some huge success with it it's theirs yeah
[872.12 --> 878.54]  but but there's an opportunity there as well because that keeps the ip alive it keeps it learn what they
[878.54 --> 886.88]  did that worked really well yeah and then do a sequel it's still your ip yeah yeah um i what other parts
[886.88 --> 892.50]  of it i i know like an argument that i've heard is like oh what about the music licensing it's like
[892.50 --> 899.54]  okay yeah that's that can be a thing take the music out i mean i think at that point you could even
[899.54 --> 904.00]  potentially task the community with doing that you could be like here's all the stuff that's not
[904.00 --> 912.24]  licensed like we we realistically you know we're we're insolvent now you know like we're not we don't
[912.24 --> 918.00]  have the we don't have the means to do anything with this anymore but yeah here's the documentation
[918.00 --> 923.58]  you guys are responsible for your own legal minefield you have to remove any licensed music
[923.58 --> 927.98]  and replace it with something else to me i'm okay with i don't know how that necessarily works legally
[927.98 --> 933.38]  but it seems fine to me i don't think you can legislate companies working on something in perpetuity
[933.38 --> 941.94]  yeah you can't do that yeah but what you can do is you can create an expectation that they will
[941.94 --> 947.42]  hand over in some semblance of working order the materials that are needed to continue the work
[947.42 --> 950.82]  if there is someone who is willing to take it on
[950.82 --> 957.08]  i don't think they can even hand over the music it needs to be removed beforehand that's easy to do
[957.08 --> 963.04]  and besides i don't think i i don't even know i don't even know if i i don't even know if i would
[963.04 --> 970.96]  buy that because realistically the the the ownership the right to use music comes down to licensing
[970.96 --> 977.62]  anyway like i could hand you a cd and that wouldn't be a license to include it in a game
[977.62 --> 984.86]  so like if if i handed you a file pack i am not handing you a license to use it in a game i'm just
[984.86 --> 991.28]  like it's it's one zero distributing the music you are
[991.28 --> 998.20]  but you're not legal people we're not going to figure this out yeah no but but you're distributing
[998.20 --> 1004.88]  it with a set of terms that prohibit actually using it for anything yeah like i i don't know
[1004.88 --> 1009.80]  that's that's that's a tough question that's for the legal people to figure out and i you know
[1009.80 --> 1016.16]  appreciate their hard work but i my point doesn't change that i don't think this is insurmountable
[1016.16 --> 1022.28]  um our other question is i know you guys are boomers and play old games but are there any
[1022.28 --> 1026.28]  games that have been shut down that have impacted your social circle i already know luke's answer
[1026.28 --> 1033.60]  oh i you probably do yeah just when wow went to yeah like that's a that's an even more interesting
[1033.60 --> 1039.00]  question because that's a version of a game that is still running yeah that's a that's a tougher one
[1039.00 --> 1045.24]  that gets really tough um i don't think there's any recourse there the community forced that too
[1045.24 --> 1051.86]  you mean bringing back wow classic yeah but then didn't wow classic like evolve and then is like
[1051.86 --> 1056.94]  not wow classic anymore yeah no so no what i mean is like nostalrius back in the day and
[1056.94 --> 1062.28]  nostalrius is the most well-known one but there's a ton of private servers for wow sure not just
[1062.28 --> 1067.72]  nostalrius and there still are private servers for wow ton many of them um the community forced that
[1067.72 --> 1072.28]  they like rebuilt boss mechanics and stuff that they didn't have because they had to build like
[1072.28 --> 1079.54]  the server side of it and it's honestly extremely impressive um that was just out of like an immense
[1079.54 --> 1087.00]  amount of community um attention i guess but there is yeah there's still the original classic wow branch
[1087.00 --> 1093.10]  that blizzard made but it's still going and it's way past classic wow now and then there's like some
[1093.10 --> 1097.58]  other versions i don't know all of them there's a hardcore one where if you die your characters
[1097.58 --> 1102.56]  done and there's one i think called season of mastery where they like change a bunch of stuff
[1102.56 --> 1107.62]  i don't i don't know if many people are into that and then there's rumors of them making what they're
[1107.62 --> 1114.38]  calling classic plus now which is a whole other thing um but yeah like games that iterate everquest
[1114.38 --> 1121.78]  wow all these old mmos like it's really interesting because where does that argument stop because it
[1121.78 --> 1127.16]  might not even be within an expansion might be a patch within an expansion yeah so like a state of a
[1127.16 --> 1133.78]  game yeah like i mean okay here's a here's a perfect example of a game that you know there
[1133.78 --> 1138.98]  wouldn't be any kind of stop killing games impact on but they've absolutely made a change to it that
[1138.98 --> 1145.24]  has killed our ability to enjoy it uh tape to tape that's an early access game i have good news for
[1145.24 --> 1152.86]  you okay that's an early access game right now that they moved away from time-based um game lengths
[1152.86 --> 1161.86]  to just first to reach a certain number of goals it's a hockey game um and luke was so upset by this
[1161.86 --> 1168.56]  change to the gameplay that i actually reached out to the lead developer um or lead designer i guess
[1168.56 --> 1175.56]  is technically his title and i i advocated on your behalf and mine as well i agree that a hockey game
[1175.56 --> 1182.02]  is determined by the clock not by how many you know who reaches the threshold number of goals is three
[1182.02 --> 1190.86]  periods three periods and um there is now a drop down which totally cool the pre-alpha branch so you
[1190.86 --> 1196.02]  can select your difficulty and you can select first to a certain number of goals or time-based which is
[1196.02 --> 1201.86]  because maybe some people will like that very weird version of first to three goals maybe some
[1201.86 --> 1207.54]  people are into that cool i don't if it's an option i'm totally down yeah so it's we're back
[1207.54 --> 1214.10]  baby i looked today and it's in nice it's in the pre-alpha branch so cool that's good yeah very cool
[1214.10 --> 1219.20]  very cool um but yeah it gets you know but yeah stop killing games wouldn't do anything about that
[1219.20 --> 1225.44]  because like everyone is mad about classic wow but it's still technically i don't know what expansion
[1225.44 --> 1230.02]  they're even on now but like the main branch is still technically there it never technically went away
[1230.02 --> 1235.48]  yep the game was technically never killed it was never killed it was just expanded upon for decades
[1235.48 --> 1241.08]  so this is a this is a tough this is going to be a tough thing to tackle because there's absolutely
[1241.08 --> 1247.10]  practical challenges like we've outlined already not being able to legislate maintaining software
[1247.10 --> 1254.98]  forever not being able to legislate never patching in or out functionality like that's something that
[1254.98 --> 1260.40]  they could do to get around this pretty easily is they could just patch out multiplayer yeah
[1260.40 --> 1268.56]  okay well that we didn't kill the game we patched the game down to a like you open a door and then
[1268.56 --> 1273.68]  the game is over it's it's it's now long it's no longer multiplayer it is single player and it
[1273.68 --> 1279.62]  shows the game uh you open one door and then the game ends and it says congratulations your speed run
[1279.62 --> 1284.18]  time is you know x or whatever and we have given the files out to the community to run this game
[1284.18 --> 1290.64]  so there's there's absolutely ways around this that we'd have to kind of try to to brainstorm all the
[1290.64 --> 1297.18]  sneaky ideas that executives and publishers might have to get around it but it's a tough problem i'm happy
[1297.18 --> 1304.16]  someone's trying to address it yes at least this is a step and i'm really glad to see that it's got the
[1304.16 --> 1311.00]  momentum that it does even if there are some voices within formerly of the industry that are speaking
[1311.00 --> 1317.06]  out against it because of some of these practical challenges around crafting this legislation and
[1317.06 --> 1325.02]  then ultimately enforcing it what do you want to talk about next oh well what's our headline not
[1325.02 --> 1331.02]  really our headline topic but what our main topic apple really wants you to see the f1 wants you to see
[1331.02 --> 1341.54]  f1 the movie yeah in an excellent piece published on the star.com dot my sure sure dot com dot my
[1341.54 --> 1348.94]  yeah okay don't worry about it uh jason atten atten atten sure jason yeah uh discusses what he thinks is
[1348.94 --> 1354.92]  apple's most important product trust and how apple violated customers trust with the recent push
[1354.92 --> 1360.96]  notifications sent to u.s iphone users through the wallet app offering them a ten dollar discount on
[1360.96 --> 1369.82]  tickets for the uh for f1 the movie huh i mean i have talked about this a fair bit but it always
[1369.82 --> 1378.66]  rings quite hypocritical to me i don't like that when apple criticizes their competitors for being ad
[1378.66 --> 1386.96]  platforms when apple is taking their very operating system and behaving no different from when microsoft
[1386.96 --> 1395.70]  integrated one drive that bothers you to subscribe to it or put stupid candy crush in the stupid start menu
[1395.70 --> 1405.34]  this is this is what apple would criticize anyone else for doing on any other timeline
[1405.34 --> 1413.24]  so atten opines that apple's entire brand is that it is not like other tech companies
[1413.24 --> 1418.42]  yes their products are expensive but in exchange for the larger bill at the checkout you get a better
[1418.42 --> 1424.02]  user experience in an ecosystem that at least claims to prioritize privacy and security over mining and
[1424.02 --> 1431.06]  monetizing your data he says that when apple uses an app most associated with security and trust to
[1431.06 --> 1439.42]  advertise to its users it crosses a line absolutely tech crunch reported on widespread social media
[1439.42 --> 1445.80]  complaints about the promotion and noted that a new offers and promotion setting for ios 26's wallet
[1445.80 --> 1452.04]  app suggests that apple plans to push more marketing through the app in the future the push notification
[1452.04 --> 1460.10]  this is funny is actually in violation of apple's own app store guidelines guideline 4.5.4 states that
[1460.10 --> 1466.56]  push notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have
[1466.56 --> 1472.74]  explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your apps ui and you provide a method in your app for
[1472.74 --> 1481.64]  a user to opt out of receiving such messages so jason goes on to say a company that has spent years telling the world that
[1481.64 --> 1488.74]  privacy is a fundamental human right a company that famously took on facebook and limited how apps can track users across other apps and
[1488.74 --> 1496.46]  websites just used its own system level app to send out marketing content that users didn't ask for
[1496.46 --> 1501.98]  and couldn't opt out of that's not a great look how much money did they get for this
[1501.98 --> 1507.42]  uh well i don't think it's so much about how much money they got i think it's more about how much money they spent
[1507.42 --> 1519.48]  like this is an apple tv production oh yeah i see our discussion question is but at least that u2 album was awesome
[1519.48 --> 1528.52]  right says jordan uh so this is actually not the first time that apple has just brazenly used their platform for marketing
[1528.52 --> 1536.10]  what is this website sorry apple tv is buying the tv rights in the u.s for f1 sorry sorry that's the affiliation
[1536.10 --> 1540.12]  thank you thank you uh jbrad uh
[1540.12 --> 1550.78]  what is it this is the star.com.my website is a mess yeah don't worry about it it's a good it's a good
[1550.78 --> 1557.62]  take either way okay yeah let's not worry too much about that for now all right so i guess the question
[1557.62 --> 1566.76]  here is are we really surprised i mean apple's hypocrisy has been on full display for so long and i know that
[1566.76 --> 1572.70]  this really this really rubs a lot of apple fans the wrong way whenever i point it out but like
[1572.70 --> 1579.44]  apple's whole thing with their whole like sub site on apple.com about all their sustainability
[1579.44 --> 1587.56]  while at the same time in their other hand they're either facilitating or explicitly enforcing the
[1587.56 --> 1595.52]  bricking of perfectly functional devices like apple's whole holier than now thing around user privacy and
[1595.52 --> 1600.28]  security while operating data centers that are effectively under the control of the chinese
[1600.28 --> 1609.12]  government for their chinese users like can we please please stop pretending that apple is anything
[1609.12 --> 1618.32]  other than an equally soulless and heartless corporation like any other please don't fall for
[1618.32 --> 1624.24]  the branding that's all i ask and when yeah and when apple rubs me the wrong way over this stuff
[1624.24 --> 1630.00]  a big part of it is honestly not that they're behaving any different this is honestly not
[1630.00 --> 1635.06]  any worse than you know samsung promoting their crap to me on my samsung phone or google promoting
[1635.06 --> 1641.86]  their crap to me on my google phone the difference is that those guys for the most part just kind of own
[1641.86 --> 1651.00]  it google's like yep we're an advertising company whereas apple sits there and just blows smoke up their
[1651.00 --> 1658.80]  own asshole about how amazing they are and how much they care about this stuff no you don't when the
[1658.80 --> 1667.02]  rubber hits the road you guys will sell us out as fast as anyone else and here's the proof in f1 okay
[1667.02 --> 1672.08]  rubber hits the road didn't quite work there but the f1 thing you know what i'm standing by it
[1672.76 --> 1678.68]  rubber one of my problems that i'm having is like people in some people in flowplane shad and some places
[1678.68 --> 1683.52]  that i'm others i'm seeing elsewhere i think this directly ties into what you were kind of just
[1683.52 --> 1691.10]  talking about but um people are like oh but it's good though it's like man you can't that doesn't
[1691.10 --> 1694.44]  work because what if the next one's not good well yeah
[1694.44 --> 1700.94]  kabi says except for linus media group incorporated they have a soul right
[1700.94 --> 1706.62]  no i'd like to think that some of the people who work here have a soul but the company itself
[1706.62 --> 1713.86]  i'd like to think that influential people who work here have a soul and care but as soon as you go
[1713.86 --> 1720.42]  public you are beholden to your shareholders and in that case your shareholders are in it for
[1720.42 --> 1728.48]  literally one thing like in in our case our primary shareholder that's me has to get out here every week
[1728.48 --> 1736.72]  and talk to you guys directly and you guys talk to me directly sometimes very direct minus we need to
[1736.72 --> 1744.08]  talk okay yeah that video you did on the lawnmower today didn't enjoy it actually actually for uh for
[1744.08 --> 1747.78]  just like a friday showcase people seem to be kind of into the lawnmower video today they said it's a
[1747.78 --> 1754.78]  lot better than the pool robot when we did so we we we want land robot not water robot the point is
[1754.78 --> 1760.52]  the point i'm making is that we have a two-way dialogue and there is an actual ability potentially
[1760.52 --> 1764.72]  at least to make your voice heard and that may actually affect change and we did take a lot of
[1764.72 --> 1770.26]  the feedback from that pool robot video and integrate it into making a better lawn robot video this time
[1770.26 --> 1776.92]  was it still just a sponsored showcase that we put in our friday time slot where it's ultimately going
[1776.92 --> 1782.26]  to get stomped on by wan show and we know it's not going to perform very well you better believe it
[1782.26 --> 1789.06]  but hey we're able to have this conversation and we're able to make it as best of that as it could
[1789.06 --> 1794.44]  possibly be whereas with a publicly traded company like at the end of the day the people with the
[1794.44 --> 1800.18]  influential voice are going to be the shareholders that are able to exert power over the board of
[1800.18 --> 1808.48]  directors and the executive team um that's it your voice doesn't actually matter and if apple sees
[1808.48 --> 1813.92]  that in spite of people being upset about this that a whole bunch more people go to see f1 the movie
[1813.92 --> 1817.76]  and they ultimately get a bunch of kickback from it they're just going to do it again
[1817.76 --> 1828.16]  so no we don't have a soul and no you shouldn't just implicitly you know believe that we have your
[1828.16 --> 1834.00]  best interest at heart at the end of the day we we are a corporation like any other but i also think
[1834.00 --> 1840.00]  that being a smaller company not a publicly traded company not having investors who are purely in it
[1840.00 --> 1847.68]  to extract as much value as possible over as fast a timeline as possible i do think that that makes
[1847.68 --> 1858.80]  smaller companies a little different maybe we even think different maybe we are apple okay i i genuinely
[1858.80 --> 1864.32]  really miss the old taglines like intel inside was really good what even is intel's current one
[1865.36 --> 1871.36]  is it still intel inside i don't think i legitimately don't even know but like this is a pro i can think
[1871.36 --> 1879.36]  of uh there's one company that i really like their tagline and then they changed it and i like kept
[1879.36 --> 1885.44]  saying their old one and then they square space mad at us build it beautiful it was so much better
[1885.44 --> 1890.96]  what is it now i don't know yeah who cares once you get one that's really good and everyone likes
[1890.96 --> 1896.00]  you should probably just keep it is this just nostalgia glasses though do you are you just a
[1896.00 --> 1901.28]  boomer who remember beautiful was good who remembers things the way they liked it intel inside was good
[1902.56 --> 1910.56]  think different was good what is apples now what's ours i don't think we have one maybe we should
[1910.56 --> 1915.76]  ignite a passion for technology okay that's on our mission statement that's not it though yeah that's
[1915.76 --> 1928.24]  not it light things on fire dude when i did that interview and talked about sort of how we see our
[1928.24 --> 1934.16]  role in the tech space as like going around and like starting little fires and like seeing what burns you
[1934.16 --> 1941.84]  know what i was thinking was ignite passion for technology but the context around the events that
[1941.84 --> 1949.12]  happened at that time with the california wildfires and the fact that i was down in california oh no
[1949.12 --> 1954.72]  and the timing of the release of the video like the wildfires hadn't happened yet when i used that
[1954.72 --> 1958.56]  analogy analogy yeah
[1958.56 --> 1965.52]  yeah so maybe we sometimes doing stuff in public is hard yeah how about we sprout passion for
[1965.52 --> 1974.96]  technology we'll change it sure sprout it it sounds impregnate it oh impregnate passion yeah that
[1976.64 --> 1985.28]  plant seeds of passion yeah deep seeds like from alien burst out of your chest
[1985.28 --> 1989.68]  um cool
[1993.20 --> 1999.44]  uh what are we is something that speaking of fires is something on fire uh somewhat i got it though it's
[1999.44 --> 2003.36]  fine he's doing great uh why don't we jump into whatever we're supposed to be doing next we could
[2003.36 --> 2008.00]  do another topic or we could do some merch messages how about some merch messages if uh luke's doing his
[2008.00 --> 2017.36]  job instead of his job whoa oh interesting okay sure uh uh merch messages are the way to interact with
[2017.36 --> 2024.64]  the show we've actually got where'd it go there it is huh we've got a really exciting new product on the
[2024.64 --> 2031.20]  store right now it is our transparent edition of the ltt screwdriver it's every bit the ltt screwdriver
[2031.20 --> 2037.28]  that you already know and love but now it's clear so you can see the bits like this and you can even
[2037.28 --> 2042.08]  see them when they're in there like that you can even see the ratchet mechanism moving around in there
[2042.08 --> 2047.12]  a little bit as it click click click click click click click and makes it satisfying noises so now
[2047.12 --> 2054.08]  is a perfect time just like jacob s to pick up one of these by sending in a merch message merch messages go to
[2054.08 --> 2059.68]  producer dan who will either reply to them himself forward them internally for someone else to address
[2059.68 --> 2066.88]  or curate them for me and luke all you got to do to send a merch message is go to lttstore.com
[2068.08 --> 2076.24]  add something to your cart like hey say for example this or the transparent collection that's a cool hoodie
[2076.24 --> 2083.28]  that actually has my dental records on it because we are absolutely unhinged people uh what else we got
[2083.28 --> 2089.68]  you could add ooh the new uh hydrophase swim shorts from our touch sand collection just add something
[2089.68 --> 2093.84]  to your cart and whenever we're live you will see a box for a merch message dan you want to show the
[2093.84 --> 2100.96]  peoples how it works sure thing i've got one here from alissa linus i have an epson home cinema 4010 pro
[2100.96 --> 2108.48]  uhd saw the valerian pro 2 video specs beat mine on paper i thought that short throws were worse than
[2108.48 --> 2114.88]  traditional projectors what am i missing is it worth switching for so i'd say traditional viewpoint
[2114.88 --> 2121.84]  is that short throws were worse because you could have more distortion um because of the the optics
[2121.84 --> 2127.68]  that are needed to create such a large image over such a short distance and how much you have to kind
[2127.68 --> 2133.92]  of stretch it in order to do that and just the the angle of the light in the wall and all that um with that said
[2133.92 --> 2143.60]  optics is an area of technological advancement over the last like 10 to 20 years that honestly
[2143.60 --> 2149.44]  probably has not gotten enough attention it's one of those things where like people often in person
[2149.44 --> 2154.80]  people thinking they're going to get an unexpected answer will ask me things like you know what's the
[2154.80 --> 2160.64]  most exciting change in technology you've seen over your career and the answer that i invariably give
[2160.64 --> 2167.04]  because i genuinely believe this uh is one that they they don't expect so nobody comes away disappointed
[2167.04 --> 2176.24]  but i think it's actually in lighting um think about what has transpired in the time our company has
[2176.24 --> 2185.44]  existed in lighting like cinema lighting technology but also just the expense even the kino float like what
[2185.44 --> 2194.00]  has scaled simultaneously in quality like lighting and in cost like lighting in the time that our
[2194.00 --> 2199.84]  company has existed name something that is not what i would have expected our kino flow diva lights
[2199.84 --> 2208.08]  were these quad fluorescent tube light things that had this cheap shoddy like corrugated plastic
[2208.72 --> 2215.36]  flap system on them they were freaking heavy they were ridiculously expensive very expensive
[2215.36 --> 2223.68]  they like sucked uh they weren't very bright and they had absolutely no capacity for adjusting them
[2224.00 --> 2229.04]  uh in terms of their um their color temperature they just like were what they were they were whatever
[2229.04 --> 2237.68]  fluorescent tubes you put in them nowadays dude companies like aperture you for like a few hundred bucks
[2237.68 --> 2244.00]  you can get lights that are ludicrously bright like you can run your entire set off a single circuit
[2244.00 --> 2249.92]  instead of having to you know have flipping like one halogen light that has to run off a cable from way
[2249.92 --> 2254.64]  the frick that set over there and then like a bunch of other ones for the back that can run on this
[2254.64 --> 2260.24]  circuit you need like three circuits to light your stupid set you can run an entire set off of a single
[2260.24 --> 2266.00]  circuit you can make all these fancy adjustments to your color temperature and your brightness it's super
[2266.00 --> 2272.88]  granular it's all like wirelessly controlled and relatively simple to integrate compared to what things were like
[2272.88 --> 2280.96]  back when we started um man what we paid for our uh flipping uh well the rgb lights dan that our first
[2280.96 --> 2286.72]  ones the blue ones sky sky panels or the titan tubes or something like that oh dude titan tubes are so
[2286.72 --> 2293.28]  expensive dude but now you can now you can get like off-brand ones that are like way cheaper they're like
[2293.28 --> 2297.84]  battery powered you could stick a light anywhere you want and just as powerful and they're and they're
[2297.84 --> 2303.20]  awesome but like our our first sky panels those are from ari which tells you everything you need to
[2303.20 --> 2308.24]  know about how much they cost and like i was like oh this is so cool because they had modes for uh like
[2308.24 --> 2314.48]  firelight flickering and modes for like old school black and white tv so you could have it like off camera
[2314.48 --> 2319.28]  and it could like cast kind of like sometimes a little bit more black sometimes a bit more white i think
[2319.28 --> 2324.48]  some just a cop car they had cop car i think some people aren't recognizing that you are talking
[2324.48 --> 2331.68]  chronologically yeah because i got a comment that are like oh this thing is much better than the kino flow
[2332.56 --> 2338.56]  the kino flow that we bought was 15 years ago yeah yeah that's the point yeah is the kino flow sucked
[2339.12 --> 2345.84]  back then but that was like the go-to like decent kind of affordable light it was like five grand or
[2345.84 --> 2350.40]  something like that almost every youtuber that was heavily investing in their camera setups at that
[2350.40 --> 2358.80]  time that i knew um had kino flows yeah and like dude by comparison i could buy some stupid little like
[2358.80 --> 2364.00]  led array on aliexpress and a little bit of like diffusion paper or something and i could get better
[2364.00 --> 2370.48]  lighting results out of that for like 20 bucks than that kino flow from it's been pretty like 13 years
[2370.48 --> 2374.56]  ago or whenever we bought it even the lights that are behind you now those tiny little square things
[2374.56 --> 2383.84]  they're so bright they're ip65 waterproof they're led um they're rgb they're taped to the floor yes
[2383.84 --> 2388.32]  you can't move them because people bump into them dude and the little battery powered ones you can put
[2388.32 --> 2393.36]  on your camera like those existed 10 years ago they were kind of rough but they were pretty bad they
[2393.36 --> 2399.12]  weren't bright they were expensive the battery life sucked like i remember we'd have to oh man we'd like
[2399.12 --> 2404.24]  micromanage like our mic pack batteries and our camera batteries and a stupid battery for the
[2404.24 --> 2410.56]  little thing uh nowadays it's so easy to build a nice rig with just like one battery that like daisy
[2410.56 --> 2418.08]  chains across to everything um no no i dude oh man smash champs smash champs is another great example of
[2418.08 --> 2428.00]  this um hold on i'm gonna i'm gonna just bring this up do you have any flipping idea what the lighting
[2428.00 --> 2433.76]  here would have cost me just like 15 years ago i think one of the reasons why this is probably so
[2433.76 --> 2440.00]  surprising for people is because house lighting premium house lighting is still really expensive
[2440.56 --> 2448.00]  and honestly i don't know why house lighting for leds looks kind of poo uh hold on where's that where's a
[2448.00 --> 2454.32]  better shot that shows okay so here oh no is that a video why do i keep clicking videos can i just click
[2454.32 --> 2460.00]  something that's not a video here we go is this a video there it's not a video okay perfect okay
[2460.00 --> 2468.80]  they're not actually on this is absolutely genius here we go finally okay okay cool so um this lighting
[2468.80 --> 2476.56]  setup here was inspired by a lighting setup that i saw in a hall in taiwan like almost 10 years ago now
[2476.56 --> 2484.24]  i think and they had these really cool fixtures they were basically giant rectangular prisms that had
[2484.24 --> 2492.08]  that were like a like diffuse uh like matte white prisms that were suspended across the entire hall
[2492.08 --> 2499.36]  kind of like this um and it was less janky because they didn't have all these stupid like ready rods and
[2499.36 --> 2504.80]  aircraft cable and stuff like they were really nice architectural design as opposed to our functional
[2504.80 --> 2513.60]  design and um ever since i played there i i knew i wanted that for my ideal lighting because it brings the
[2513.60 --> 2519.12]  lights down closer to the court and the closer the light is the less bright it needs to be and
[2519.12 --> 2524.00]  therefore the less dazzling it is whenever you accidentally look directly into the light which
[2524.00 --> 2528.88]  inevitably will happen when there's a moving projectile that could be coming from anywhere to
[2528.88 --> 2536.88]  anywhere on the court surface um to do something like that back in the day good lord they were so bright
[2536.88 --> 2543.36]  crazy yeah you would it would have had to have been full of either incandescent or ccfl light sources
[2543.36 --> 2548.80]  you'd be losing a bunch of it to the to the diffusion layer nowadays do you know how we made
[2548.80 --> 2555.68]  these these are just like your typical four by two office light panels and then they're just on an
[2555.68 --> 2563.28]  angle yeah they're just mounted to like this uh this aluminum structure here is is there a diffusion
[2563.28 --> 2568.72]  layer on there in addition to the standard no that's just built in yeah because it looks good it's
[2568.72 --> 2572.40]  just built in it looks like way better they've got little color temperature switches on them
[2573.04 --> 2576.88]  so you can just decide what color temperature you want and look at this you can actually really
[2576.88 --> 2584.40]  tell in the picture that the consistency is really good oh yeah like even it feels like that when
[2584.40 --> 2590.64]  you're there too even when led panels got somewhat affordable like i don't know what five years ago
[2590.64 --> 2597.04]  10 years ago the cri of them sucked and the consistency was all over the place nowadays you
[2597.04 --> 2603.68]  can just buy commodity stuff like these weren't even expensive i mean buy enough of them and anything's
[2603.68 --> 2611.36]  expensive but relatively speaking they weren't even expensive and they're just outstanding and so i yeah
[2611.36 --> 2618.40]  i just i can't think of anything in the technology space that has come down in price and up in quality
[2618.40 --> 2623.84]  like led lighting and i gotta i gotta caveat this with i'm gonna say health things and you're watching
[2623.84 --> 2631.60]  a tech podcast so don't don't uh don't yell at me just look it up a lime a day keeps your lover away
[2633.20 --> 2639.52]  um i was trying to pick something i like that one uh but yeah i've heard meanwhile in homes i've heard
[2639.52 --> 2644.72]  that things like the very very white light that we're getting from modern leds and stuff is like
[2644.72 --> 2649.36]  bad for you because of circadian rhythm things and stuff like that oh like the color temperature
[2649.36 --> 2654.80]  that we yeah that we set everything to cri i think something they're not very full spectrum no i'm not
[2654.80 --> 2660.64]  i'm not very up on top of this but and then like actually nice lighting for your home is really
[2660.64 --> 2666.48]  expensive still so it hasn't the the like consumer space hasn't really followed the exact same trend in
[2666.48 --> 2672.00]  my experience oh as like the production space and the commercial space yeah well maybe it's just different
[2672.00 --> 2678.00]  different incentives right like on the production space in the production space everything comes down
[2678.00 --> 2685.44]  to like yeah why yeah i mean i guess just my understanding is like led technology just misses
[2685.44 --> 2690.00]  a whole bunch of wavelengths and then you get something like the china ball that's above us
[2690.00 --> 2695.28]  which is a you know full spectrum proper real light uh-huh they have to do a lot of work
[2695.28 --> 2702.56]  right interesting that's my understanding please feel free to correct me but you know a high cri and
[2702.56 --> 2708.72]  full spectrum bulbs are way easier to do in the in the day and i guess what's driving what's driving
[2708.72 --> 2713.92]  the innovation there that allows them to do that in the production space is a combination like you've got
[2713.92 --> 2723.04]  the volume to invest in building a a really good led light and which obviously you would have in in like a
[2723.04 --> 2728.32]  home setting as well you have the volume but in a production space you also have people willing to
[2728.32 --> 2733.60]  pay at least some premium whereas i don't know about you but for me when i'm like buying a light bulb to
[2733.60 --> 2742.72]  put in a fixture in my house i'm not i'm not paying like extra yeah and it's and it's cheaper because you
[2742.72 --> 2745.36]  don't have to care yeah we really have to care
[2745.36 --> 2753.20]  that's interesting yeah and the flicker free stuff like your leds can blink in your home
[2753.20 --> 2758.32]  that's apparently a huge problem you can't perceptively tell that they're blinking but it's like bad for
[2758.32 --> 2765.04]  you for some ish reason again like please yeah who knows i did make sure i did make sure these don't
[2765.04 --> 2768.96]  flicker where's my do you want to press the thing oh uh yeah i could i could do that
[2768.96 --> 2775.92]  do do do do do it there you go there we go i don't know look it up if you care but uh there's
[2775.92 --> 2779.44]  there's a lot of stuff going on with lighting yeah i made sure these don't flicker because
[2779.44 --> 2785.12]  we want to be able to record in slow-mo at some point and i didn't want that to be a problem so so
[2785.12 --> 2792.24]  and it was not that hard to find just commodity office lights that just to go in a drop ceiling that
[2792.24 --> 2797.28]  don't flicker it was just it blew my mind that never used to be a thing yeah i know right like
[2797.28 --> 2805.84]  impossible i know right yeah so the quality just keeps getting it gets and it's happening so fast
[2805.84 --> 2810.96]  like even five years ago when we were looking for lights like for the office it was freaking
[2810.96 --> 2816.32]  impossible to find anything that like brandon wouldn't lose his if we installed and like
[2816.32 --> 2821.28]  didn't have also proper filming lights in addition to them whereas like nowadays we could just huck these
[2821.28 --> 2826.72]  in the office and turn on a camera like incredible pretty i think the ones we put in the labs like
[2826.72 --> 2833.52]  the drop-in ceiling ones pretty high cri yep pretty decent super dimmable yeah yeah top gear and full
[2833.52 --> 2839.12]  planchette is calling it pwm flicker um yeah that's that's right but yeah like the the old ones would
[2839.12 --> 2844.88]  just kind of glow oh incandescence yeah yeah so there you didn't have the flicker problem well they ran off
[2844.88 --> 2850.72]  they ran directly off of ac so theoretically they should flicker but because you were just heating up a
[2850.72 --> 2857.52]  thing an element uh it wouldn't cool down enough in between the cycles for it to be a problem so it
[2857.52 --> 2864.88]  wasn't until we started doing things digitally that we were like oh whoops um and and anytime you had a
[2864.88 --> 2870.96]  dimmable bulb they just oh man did they ever suck in the early days emily shebang has said uh in in
[2870.96 --> 2876.48]  flow plane chat said i'm autistic terrible sensory issues and can see the tiniest micro flicker possible and
[2876.48 --> 2882.00]  it's uh triggered my seizures yeah so flicker is bad and apparently it affects at least some people
[2882.00 --> 2889.60]  people that don't have those problems no i as far as uh as far as i have heard it's like technically
[2889.60 --> 2897.12]  bad for all of us to a certain degree um i don't know was that one merch message
[2899.20 --> 2904.24]  good lord i'm either really good at this or really bad at it um thank you for sending a nice
[2904.24 --> 2908.40]  merch message depends what we're trying to accomplish okay yeah yeah go for it dan um
[2908.40 --> 2915.36]  why don't we do a second one and then we'll get into the sauce stuff sure um let's see good day
[2915.36 --> 2922.40]  tall slightly shorter and short why is my download speed in australia so slow i've noticed over in
[2922.40 --> 2928.88]  northern america speeds are two to three times faster very jealous cheers how tall are you dan six foot two
[2928.88 --> 2932.00]  or sorry sorry five foot 14
[2935.04 --> 2935.44]  get out
[2938.16 --> 2939.28]  i can't out my head
[2943.04 --> 2950.08]  oh hold on the female audience in float plane chat says yes and you never answered it it was about
[2950.08 --> 2958.08]  projectors oh um these days i would say you can get a short throw with relatively low distortion however
[2958.08 --> 2965.76]  i will say that compared to an ultra short throw the higher end cinema models do still tend to be
[2965.76 --> 2975.20]  um short throw or like normal ish throw lengths and those tend to be the higher quality models that
[2975.20 --> 2981.44]  have features like lens shift that make it much easier to get perfect alignment uh etc etc so and
[2981.44 --> 2986.96]  they're like just giant bulbs right there you go okay sorry uh what was the new one uh yes why is the
[2986.96 --> 2992.40]  internet slow in australia um because you're a penal colony and nobody cares about you
[2995.44 --> 3003.68]  i'm glad somebody said it um the actual reason is the ocean because there's limited tubes
[3003.68 --> 3012.96]  what they call it it's the internet is not a big lorry well now and everybody's cutting them that
[3012.96 --> 3016.96]  doesn't help yeah those darn sharks willie's not helping way to go china
[3022.32 --> 3027.76]  all right uh are we what are we doing now do you want to do the game do you want to do another topic
[3027.76 --> 3032.24]  and then the game i guess we should probably do the game which i just lost and so did all of you
[3032.88 --> 3033.04]  oh
[3033.04 --> 3037.04]  oh
[3042.00 --> 3048.96]  okay so um i was handed this backpack yes don't open the backpack just yet yeah i'm supposed to not
[3048.96 --> 3055.36]  see or something yeah i put the talk away close your eyes do uh turn them in 360 degrees and walk away
[3055.36 --> 3061.76]  one commuter back okay that's an old reference still checks out i get it vintage
[3064.40 --> 3068.72]  okay now what do you read the thing oh wait i have to close my eyes no no i close my eyes oh he
[3068.72 --> 3076.00]  closes his eyes my eyes are closed let's play a game lime day you don't have to you don't have to
[3076.00 --> 3084.24]  close your eyes i don't me yeah no just close the dock it's fine okay lime day our annual sales event
[3084.24 --> 3090.08]  where we squeeze our margins and bring you sweet deals is happening next week starting wednesday
[3090.08 --> 3096.56]  july 9th but instead of just listing out the deals you can expect we thought it'd be fun to play a
[3096.56 --> 3103.76]  little game luke yes we're going to show you five different items that are going to be on sale or in a
[3103.76 --> 3110.40]  bundle during lime day okay you have one guess to figure out what each item is
[3110.40 --> 3120.88]  but here's the catch the picture is going to be very zoomed in oh oh and if you don't get at least
[3120.88 --> 3128.08]  three out of five you have to take a bite out of this lime oh but if you do get three out of five
[3128.80 --> 3134.64]  minus has to i take a bite out of the line all right i don't think i'll mind taking the bite out of
[3134.64 --> 3140.56]  the lime so hopefully with skin i with skin i mean i would assume so yeah just chomping oh
[3141.52 --> 3146.40]  right inside of it do you have to consume the whole thing no just take a take a bite i think you have
[3146.40 --> 3151.76]  to at least chew three times i'm fine with that i don't know if i want to yeah i don't think you have
[3151.76 --> 3155.44]  to swallow okay yeah we don't do we yeah it's not that type of show
[3155.44 --> 3163.76]  not yet wait for after dark yeah really okay all right there's some interesting stuff because
[3163.76 --> 3169.12]  like both of our backpacks use reprieve right uh yes so like
[3171.68 --> 3175.28]  and then also last year there was stuff in lime day that we don't sell
[3175.84 --> 3181.60]  normally so this might be kind of tough how am i supposed to see the things i guess dan it'll pop
[3181.60 --> 3186.56]  up on screen okay and then after you get it right or wrong we'll we'll show you the full picture
[3186.56 --> 3191.60]  that it was based off of and then we'll show you the item all right you ready for number one first item
[3195.52 --> 3201.20]  what product is that luke i think i'm not gonna eat this lime are you actually kidding me what's

[3242.16 --> 3251.44]  that was that was really hard that oh that was the easy one oh okay wait okay okay so dan you
[3251.44 --> 3255.76]  shouldn't show him the thing i think that's why i have this i think i'm supposed to show him the
[3255.76 --> 3261.28]  the thing that's in here i'm looking i have no idea oh i think it's i actually have two water bottles
[3261.28 --> 3267.92]  ah okay i guess they wanted me to point out that we have different sizes that's true oh sorry i got
[3267.92 --> 3273.20]  those wrong looking at stuff yep there we go you can just look up it's fine i'm just holding up
[3273.20 --> 3278.40]  water bottles i just don't look at the dock i had them wrong before now they're fixed don't look at the
[3278.40 --> 3282.80]  dock and you're fine i've got the text uncovered i i'm not this is my what are you doing all right

[3336.80 --> 3341.44]  no that seems fair it's going to take forever if you do that that seems okay you have to close the

[3867.36 --> 3872.00]  out forever you guys that's because he won't guess because he's gonna lose come on what's your
[3872.00 --> 3876.88]  what's your thought what's my thought i thought uh but i don't know if i can say because i don't know
[3876.88 --> 3883.92]  if it's even like say it say it uh let me type it to linus you can say anything you want say it
[3883.92 --> 3891.60]  it's our brand new wang edition of the ltd backpack that's right my friends
[3897.36 --> 3899.04]  i'm so thrown off because
[3900.96 --> 3906.16]  i thought lebronics were in the bag but this wasn't in the bag so i thought i was losing by saying when
[3906.16 --> 3914.08]  back it's the same backpack you know and love but with a little more when personality we're going
[3914.08 --> 3919.12]  to be launching it next week but since it's lime day we're going to be loading it up with something

[3945.92 --> 3950.40]  you are going to have a day of early access to all of our week-long deals
[3953.28 --> 3958.80]  could maybe put it in the frame yeah they turn it around maybe i don't know just ideas um okay
[3958.80 --> 3962.80]  okay crying out loud you guys where's the salesmanship
[3966.48 --> 3967.36]  good enough is there
[3971.36 --> 3974.16]  we could we could we could give me the damn lime
[3975.84 --> 3980.72]  oh wow that's tough yeah i watched you really try like he gave it a shot
[3982.72 --> 3983.84]  do you want to open it up first
[3983.84 --> 3991.04]  oh i am i i swear i'm like really trying to break this thing
[3994.00 --> 3997.60]  do you want me to do it too the contest was kind of messed up i can join you in this if you would
[3997.60 --> 4002.16]  like i mean that's that's your call if you want to eat a lime you can eat a lime i won't stop you
[4002.16 --> 4012.32]  i don't know if i can get in there or not
[4013.84 --> 4015.84]  oh
[4020.08 --> 4024.64]  sure oh man did you swallow the peel nope i'm just still going
[4026.48 --> 4030.88]  you know it's turning kind of nice it starts really bad but it gets pretty okay do you need
[4030.88 --> 4037.04]  do you need a bucket i got juice all over my laptop mm-hmm i got it mostly on my pants oh
[4037.04 --> 4044.08]  uh it's also like all on one side which is really well i mean it depends what side it's hanging down
[4044.08 --> 4045.92]  right that's what i was it's supposed to hang
[4045.92 --> 4060.40]  okay we did it nice job did anyone think to have like a napkin or anything handy for this or i don't think so nice
[4060.40 --> 4067.12]  oh i mean we deserved that yeah well i did i don't know if you did i'm blocked by a tv sorry
[4068.48 --> 4074.16]  also you you mentioned how like them helping me was not helping me it's they were actually
[4074.16 --> 4079.36]  unhelpful where is it on the website it's not on the website the wan backpack it's not exactly i don't
[4079.36 --> 4084.16]  know what they're talking about dude they were i didn't know that they legitimately was like i am
[4084.16 --> 4089.04]  losing but this is the only thing i can think makes sense i went from being like kind of annoyed
[4089.04 --> 4093.76]  because they were giving you a bunch of hints in this game that was supposed to be a game to kind
[4093.76 --> 4101.68]  of annoyed because they were like sabotaging you yeah that was it was just sammy i repeatedly like i
[4101.68 --> 4105.76]  thought screwdriver would not have been possible because they said it wasn't on the website but i
[4105.76 --> 4112.00]  understand what he meant that variant wasn't yeah i think i i was super confused because i didn't
[4112.00 --> 4119.92]  know that variant existed on my monitors that's sort of orange yeah so i thought it was a color problem
[4119.92 --> 4125.20]  this monitor is extremely red yeah i thought it was a color problem so i thought because of that it
[4125.20 --> 4130.32]  wasn't the screwdriver because they said it wasn't on the website so i was like what else can it possibly
[4130.32 --> 4136.88]  be none of see i knew that everything was fine and working completely normally and that his guess
[4136.88 --> 4145.04]  was good but we just had to sit through like four minutes of you guys misleading him i was uninformed
[4145.04 --> 4153.12]  just get on with it yeah okay so buy things uh next topic jeez buy our products so that we don't have
[4153.12 --> 4159.84]  to do this again what is this stupid show also in my defense and definitely the angle is way off but
[4159.84 --> 4164.24]  i thought it was this but way more zoomed in for the water bottle yeah this this is not i thought
[4164.24 --> 4170.16]  it was like it is the water bottle yeah half of it is the water bottle no i get it no no that's just
[4170.16 --> 4174.48]  what he's going for the neck i see what he's going for yeah i just i just thought it was like a
[4174.48 --> 4179.68]  slightly weird photo i'm picking up what you're throwing down the germans have a word for everything
[4179.68 --> 4185.92]  on the last wan show we got into a discussion about whether or not lmg is a big company or a
[4185.92 --> 4190.48]  small company and i kind of tried to describe or the way that i ultimately described it was
[4191.60 --> 4197.28]  we're a big enough company that a credit union cannot service our business properly yeah but we're
[4197.28 --> 4203.20]  too small of a company for the big multinational banks to like really care about us no no no to care
[4203.20 --> 4213.92]  about us at all like at all anyway redditor alactrium underscore reached out with a german word that
[4213.92 --> 4221.04]  defines us and apparently it is mittelstand which according to wikipedia commonly refers to a group
[4221.04 --> 4227.28]  of stable business enterprises that have proved successful in enduring economic change and turbulence
[4227.28 --> 4232.40]  and is defined as a statistical category of small and medium-sized enterprises with annual revenues up to
[4232.40 --> 4240.64]  50 million euro and a maximum of 500 employees so here's the uh here's the here's the the the
[4240.64 --> 4247.28]  little wikipedia it would have been nice if we linked to the actual post uh but oh yeah no here it is
[4247.84 --> 4253.76]  here it is so the way that they defined it was a little bit differently uh we made up a word for this kind of company
[4253.76 --> 4264.56]  it's um okay yeah anyway no never mind yep cool good definition thank you that actually does help
[4265.68 --> 4271.28]  yeah we're we're a mittelstand yeah is what our company is and there are complications with that
[4271.28 --> 4279.28]  the transition is painful surprisingly very difficult and painful and i can understand why a lot of companies
[4279.28 --> 4288.16]  might not make it like i i gotta confess when people told me that the um i forget people lay it out both
[4288.16 --> 4296.32]  in like revenue terms and in like headcount terms um but when people told me like oh yeah this transition
[4296.32 --> 4302.48]  when you grow from like 100 to 500 employees is where most companies die i always looked at it and went
[4302.48 --> 4309.04]  well like that's crazy why would that happen like if you're if you're profitable and doing great up to
[4309.04 --> 4317.52]  80 employees what you have 110 employees and you just go bankrupt um but what we're learning as we are
[4317.52 --> 4326.56]  as we have scaled to 100 over 100 back under 100 and then now over 100 over the course of the last like
[4326.56 --> 4333.44]  three years where we haven't really grown in headcount at all is that the communication and process
[4333.44 --> 4338.64]  challenges associated with crossing this threshold you effectively have to rebuild your entire company are
[4339.44 --> 4345.12]  painful but the difference is that this time you're building the airplane while flying it whereas the
[4345.12 --> 4353.84]  first time um you were building the airplane and figuring out how to take off the runway like it's a very
[4353.84 --> 4361.84]  very different experience and there's so many more voices so many more vested interests it's um it's
[4361.84 --> 4367.84]  been challenging to put it lightly no i like it that way
[4373.84 --> 4374.64]  nothing changed
[4377.76 --> 4380.72]  and now way more people know about oh i saw their messages
[4380.72 --> 4385.12]  don't imagine this will bother even more people now
[4387.20 --> 4396.80]  i tried does it how is it better if they match i don't think so i really don't think so
[4399.28 --> 4407.12]  um well we'll see this is interesting the colombian navy has snagged a starlink equipped narco sub
[4407.12 --> 4413.60]  on wednesday this week the colombian navy captured an unmanned semi-submersible that was equipped with a
[4413.60 --> 4420.08]  starlink antenna this unmanned drone vessel is believed to have been a trial run for automated
[4420.08 --> 4425.92]  cocaine trafficking no drugs were found aboard the vessel but colombian officials stated that it had the
[4425.92 --> 4433.84]  capacity to transport as much as one and a half tons of cocaine so it was a test run manned semi-submersibles
[4433.84 --> 4438.32]  clandestinely built in the jungle have been used for decades to ferry cocaine from colombia to
[4438.32 --> 4444.88]  central america and mexico and have in recent years been found crossing the atlantic and pacific oceans
[4446.32 --> 4451.60]  colombian law calls for prison terms of up to 14 years for the use construction marketing
[4451.60 --> 4457.60]  possession and transportation of semi-submersibles that's obviously working great
[4457.60 --> 4464.56]  unmanned subs eliminate the possibility of a captured crew cooperating with authorities
[4465.20 --> 4472.56]  this is really interesting so i learned recently that um people were equipping planes with starlink
[4473.20 --> 4481.20]  by just like putting the antenna like in the window of the front and just pointing it up and then starlink
[4481.20 --> 4485.36]  because they're they have launched now i believe they've launched they've launched or they're launching
[4485.36 --> 4494.24]  their um like their their corporate jet service um starlink has apparently countered this by doing a
[4494.24 --> 4501.84]  speed check and making sure that your receipt your receiver unit is not moving too fast
[4503.20 --> 4507.36]  because there's nothing that would prevent the service from working so then you want because they
[4507.36 --> 4511.92]  because what they're going to upcharge the airlines i guess yeah yeah well because they want the plane
[4511.92 --> 4519.76]  version to pay more yeah so uh starlink uh what's it called not commercial corporate corporate um
[4520.64 --> 4523.36]  airplane uh uh price here
[4527.20 --> 4533.04]  for corporate and private jet applications starlink aviation offers hardware for a hundred fifty
[4533.76 --> 4541.60]  thousand dollars with monthly service plans ranging from two thousand to twenty five thousand dollars
[4541.92 --> 4547.12]  which honestly as far as my understanding goes is it's about in line oh i thought it was cheaper
[4547.84 --> 4554.48]  uh i don't really think so for like a jumbo jet oh oh that maybe okay sure sure i'm not talking about
[4554.48 --> 4561.20]  the installation at all no no i have no idea on that possibly um yeah no but no it's apparently this
[4561.20 --> 4566.96]  is for business jets according to pilot mail says the ai summary so take that for take that for what it is
[4566.96 --> 4570.80]  you gotta you gotta watch them ai summaries business unlimited ten thousand dollars a month i think
[4570.80 --> 4572.80]  that's pretty competitive um
[4575.28 --> 4582.88]  so so yeah uh and the interesting thing about it is from my understanding this basically just comes down
[4582.88 --> 4590.08]  to like certification and regulation because from what i heard from my uncle nothing prevented anyone
[4590.08 --> 4597.20]  from just putting the like ground-based starlink in the in the cockpit and just pointing it up
[4597.76 --> 4604.56]  and getting starlink service but but with all the like certification and everything uh the the prices do go
[4605.20 --> 4613.52]  up a lot because you're not allowed to just like install you know starlink in your own you know plane like
[4614.16 --> 4619.92]  it has to be done by a certified shop yeah not necessarily weird in a bad way but apparently they take
[4619.92 --> 4626.08]  like fire resistance extremely seriously like to the nth degree like if you have a fire on a plane
[4626.08 --> 4631.52]  that's apparently the worst i mean makes sense it kind of does make sense yeah it makes perfect sense to me
[4631.52 --> 4642.32]  yeah um yeah please just open the window they really are just oxygen and fuel big containers of oxygen and
[4642.32 --> 4648.96]  big containers of fuel yeah everywhere the fire could go is really bad yeah
[4648.96 --> 4657.76]  yeah oh boy let's see if i can find this yeah everything everything everything plain is just
[4658.72 --> 4668.48]  whatever it costs on land um times you know a bunch yeah now consider space
[4669.44 --> 4672.96]  oh dude the last place not ruined by capitalism
[4672.96 --> 4679.52]  space give him time if you don't know that reference look it up it's amazing it's amazing
[4679.52 --> 4684.40]  it's amazing watching him like crack up as he says he's having such a good time do you want to you
[4684.40 --> 4687.76]  want to play another little game sure okay
[4687.76 --> 4705.12]  this is a usb outlet okay it has usb c at 15 watts and usba at 15 watts how much do you think this module costs
[4706.08 --> 4716.48]  this is for a plane uh yes this is from mcico.com true blue power assuming a very substantial price
[4716.48 --> 4721.12]  increase off of what this would cost a consumer i think i'm still going to be
[4721.92 --> 4725.44]  intensely low but i'm going to say 125 bucks
[4727.68 --> 4737.60]  oh well as low as 423 dollars okay hold on one sec so adding usb c because the one beside it was
[4737.60 --> 4744.88]  exactly the same but no no usb c right so adding usb c is like over 200 uh i think you mean as low as
[4744.88 --> 4754.16]  oh 213 dollars hold on but wait there's more okay let's say for instance because that's just
[4754.16 --> 4762.16]  regular old like crappy usb c where it's just doing the voltages and amperages of a usba port but it's
[4762.16 --> 4772.32]  just shaped like a usb c port huh okay how about the appropriately named 6430 360-21
[4772.32 --> 4779.84]  this does usb c pd oh 100 watts at 5 amps and then usba at 15 watts
[4781.04 --> 4784.32]  considering so the last one was 425 is that right yeah something like that
[4785.52 --> 4792.80]  i'm gonna say 1100 oh you're actually high this time oh that's actually a much lower increase than i
[4792.80 --> 4800.48]  expected seven hundo i mean that's obviously absurd but i i expected them to just go even harder dude that's
[4800.48 --> 4807.12]  like freaking wild it's like a it's like more than 10x uh oh actually i don't know if that's more than
[4807.12 --> 4813.44]  10x because i was shopping for a usb pd like outlet to put in my wall the other day decently expensive
[4813.44 --> 4816.80]  and they're they're pretty expensive that's why i thought it was gonna be so much more i'm actually
[4816.80 --> 4822.56]  surprised the lift on that is as low as it is wow luke's so out of touch john mash says oh 700
[4822.56 --> 4827.12]  that's actually a much better deal than i expected i wonder if that's the bulk deal if you get 10 000 of
[4827.12 --> 4837.04]  them oh dude as low as who knows moq 100 what i don't know did that say oh no no no no no no no
[4837.04 --> 4843.12]  that's that'd be crazy that'd be crazy that's all that's all absurd because like how much would
[4843.12 --> 4854.72]  like i'm i'm just thinking cables because you could just if you just mounted extensions into like a uh
[4854.72 --> 4868.08]  a 3d printed little square yeah it's like 30 bucks yeah like nothing sheesh wild um this is uh
[4868.08 --> 4874.64]  j ritchie 1984 says this is why experimental aviation is so much less expensive i can add a
[4874.64 --> 4882.08]  usb power outlet to a van's rv7 for like 30 bucks i'm not actually familiar with the van's rv7 so i
[4882.08 --> 4888.00]  looked it up and this is it popular two-seat single-engine low-wing home-built aircraft kit
[4888.00 --> 4894.16]  known for its sporty handling and performance dude how is it that like
[4894.16 --> 4902.88]  like i don't know how is it that i keep discovering stuff this cool that i have never heard of so if
[4902.88 --> 4910.88]  you want you can buy a kit airplane and fly it and it's known for its sporty are you serious right now
[4910.88 --> 4917.44]  if you want some interesting info and i and i i can't explain why i know this but it's not for me
[4917.44 --> 4924.08]  i'll put that out there first bc actually has really fantastic laws for experimental aircraft
[4924.08 --> 4929.28]  they are allowed to be much heavier here than a lot of places in the states meaning you can put like
[4929.28 --> 4935.28]  better engines and better wings and more fuel than you can in the states it's a big problem in the
[4935.28 --> 4940.24]  states you you really get limited by weight really intensely and our limit is like genuinely i think like
[4940.24 --> 4944.56]  five times higher like it's not it's not a little bit of an increase it's very substantial
[4945.36 --> 4949.76]  and yeah they fall under experimentals i'm trying to look up the um
[4951.12 --> 4959.04]  ec experiment like how much are these standard kits okay hold on standard kits here we go
[4959.68 --> 4964.80]  this means the fabrication work we do on the kit parts is less than 50 of the total required to
[4964.80 --> 4970.16]  complete the aircraft oh that's what makes it a kit so you have to oh good lord you have to provide
[4970.16 --> 4977.44]  the engine the prop the instruments the avionics and the upholstery yeah uh okay
[4979.44 --> 4982.32]  standard build kit that's a plane
[4985.44 --> 4993.68]  that's a plane so that you get this in the mail justin can make it that is dude those panels don't
[4993.68 --> 4999.36]  even look bent you have to shape them yourself oh no you would um you would fold them and rivet them to
[4999.36 --> 5006.00]  this the subframe wouldn't you yeah we do not do the small trimming and adjusting jobs which the
[5006.00 --> 5012.72]  average home builder in the average shop can do just as well as we can okay trim in this context i
[5012.72 --> 5020.16]  think means like like like adjust the thing so that it like flies in a straight line that's what we mean
[5020.16 --> 5024.56]  by trimming right maybe the panels fit together i don't think that's what that means it says we
[5024.56 --> 5030.00]  do not do the small trimming and adjusting jobs that's making the panels i think they're talking
[5030.00 --> 5032.96]  about the panels okay trimming the panels i'm fairly certain
[5035.52 --> 5041.76]  okay sure rv kits are gonna need another garage you'll find we want to continuously improve them
[5041.76 --> 5046.32]  the biggest improvement okay so where's where's the price trim is an active adjustment you do in
[5046.32 --> 5052.24]  flight that's a normal thing i'm just saying i'm just saying you do it yourself that's all
[5052.24 --> 5060.08]  kit build aircraft okay so rv rv7 was the one that the person said here we go so uh kit kit order form
[5060.08 --> 5067.92]  okay what do these cost like i have no idea throw some stuff in there yeah i can start clicking okay
[5067.92 --> 5075.20]  well i'll need one okay includes electric aileron trim okay yeah good wing kit i'll need wings probably
[5075.20 --> 5083.84]  probably for my aircraft you could make your own oh you can get a quick build wing uh add quick build
[5083.84 --> 5090.32]  wing okay so this is basically oh oh yeah okay so that's another like five grand four grand four
[5090.32 --> 5096.80]  four four four grand oh uh fuselage kit i'm i i might need a fuselage you might need to sit somewhere
[5096.80 --> 5103.60]  yeah i received my center section with my wing kit so i have possession of it already i
[5103.60 --> 5109.68]  i uh sure i guess it comes with my wing kit uh i don't need a quick build i'll build my fuselage
[5109.68 --> 5117.04]  okay i wanna oh i want a sliding canopy obviously sliding is so sick obviously i have finishing kit
[5117.04 --> 5129.36]  whoa okay i mean uh spinner type um uh okay ship two wow seriously there you go i mean i'm less than
[5129.36 --> 5133.20]  bryce well you don't have an engine yeah i'm i'm sure i'm missing some stuff you don't have a seat
[5133.20 --> 5136.88]  that was that was the price today it was actually 58
[5139.52 --> 5144.96]  that's what you have to pay now yeah go back and look at the page the kit total amount to pay today
[5144.96 --> 5155.60]  uh there you deposit you still don't have an engine no okay but still like realistically i'm up in the air
[5155.60 --> 5163.04]  for probably less than like my tycan oh yeah like what does like how fast does one of these fly like
[5163.04 --> 5169.52]  is it like rv how is this a thing how does how is your business making
[5170.80 --> 5178.72]  build yourself aircraft oh sorry so the maximum takeoff weight of 50 uh 544 kilograms or 1200 pounds
[5178.72 --> 5184.96]  you can have one or two seats and they must have a stall speed of 39 knots or less oh okay no design
[5184.96 --> 5194.24]  standards that's for ultra light airplanes but there's like lots of other things going on oh was
[5194.24 --> 5199.92]  this was this plane specifically on there don't it down yeah down to down to down down down down down
[5199.92 --> 5205.44]  oh here we go uh oh no no no i saw the seven and i thought we were i thought it was rv7 but it's
[5205.44 --> 5213.44]  beach 77 something but yeah like down in down in the the america the um the weight is much lower as
[5213.44 --> 5219.44]  far as i know at least in california america gets weird about laws because their whole state system
[5219.44 --> 5228.40]  thing so i don't know okay so the vans aircraft rv7 uh apparently has a top speed of 350 kilometers an hour
[5228.40 --> 5236.40]  which is something that is man that is so okay what engine is that with though because isn't
[5236.40 --> 5242.48]  isn't the rv7 oh that's is that a kid or no i think you'd probably have to have a like a rated max speed
[5242.48 --> 5248.16]  of the chassis like you couldn't just put any engine you want on it and go 900 kilometers an hour and rip
[5248.16 --> 5255.12]  the freaking thing apart right the ai overview seems to think it's legal in canada that's crazy who knows
[5255.12 --> 5262.64]  what that means this actually explains something that i have wondered about a lot like dude facebook
[5262.64 --> 5272.64]  marketplace is full of airplanes and really yeah oh dude dude airplanes because i've told you like i i
[5272.64 --> 5279.04]  i train my facebook marketplace algorithm to just show me the wildest stuff and so i started clicking on
[5279.04 --> 5285.60]  like airplanes for a bit there's so many aircraft on facebook marketplace and this raises so many
[5285.60 --> 5291.12]  questions for me why do all these people own aircraft why do they buy and sell them on facebook
[5291.12 --> 5296.32]  marketplace of all places like i just i couldn't wrap my brain around it yeah it's totally legal in
[5296.32 --> 5305.28]  canada i had no idea that the pricing for them was this accessible like sure it's really expensive but
[5305.28 --> 5309.76]  when you compare it to what people will spend on like you know a boat or whatever it's not that
[5309.76 --> 5317.52]  different whereas i just assumed like oh yeah you know a car is expensive a boat is more expensive and
[5317.52 --> 5323.68]  a plane is like way more expensive i just i just thought they were like way more expensive but it's like
[5325.12 --> 5330.32]  it's expensive but yeah compared to what people might spend on their boat and all of their you know
[5330.32 --> 5335.52]  um like water skiing gear or you know whatever right like
[5337.52 --> 5343.04]  sure cool what are we supposed to be talking about why don't we do sponsors hold on i found you an engine
[5343.60 --> 5350.32]  oh yeah yeah okay what am i gonna what am i gonna pay for it it's a lycoming engine uh i'm not seeing it
[5353.60 --> 5358.32]  100 grand yeah that's the most powerful engine i could find that works in that oh you could get a
[5358.32 --> 5365.12]  rebuilt one for like 55 grand dude you could totally be in the air for like tycan price 215 horsepower i
[5365.12 --> 5373.52]  say do it 210 to 215 horsepower this is not this is not me i'm not doing this you're not doing this no
[5373.52 --> 5380.00]  i know this stuff because of someone else not me i bet i i bet i bet luke's getting into aviation no
[5380.00 --> 5384.88]  that's that i'd love to he runs a site called floatplane and he just couldn't handle it anymore see
[5384.88 --> 5388.96]  that's the problem this wouldn't work for me because i can't land on water so i could put you
[5388.96 --> 5393.52]  in touch with my old neighbor who used to get crashed out float planes and rebuild them and then
[5393.52 --> 5400.00]  fly them and that is not a made-up anecdote that is real why do you always know a guy literally i've
[5400.00 --> 5406.40]  had a very exciting life i've told you about him before yeah i think you have yeah but yeah but from
[5406.40 --> 5410.72]  what i'm sure there's some other one but from like literally two minutes of research that's the most
[5410.72 --> 5417.20]  powerful engine that fits in the rv7 i mean he was excited that he found a replacement plastic light
[5417.20 --> 5424.08]  cover and it was only 80 us dollars it's about the size of like less than your fist how happy would
[5424.08 --> 5428.56]  he be with 3d printing now because i think with these experiment it would not be rated for flight
[5428.56 --> 5436.56]  but but i mean these were these are like oh yeah yeah we're still in the oh maybe the rv7 is a plane plane
[5436.56 --> 5440.88]  because i was wondering maybe you could get like a crashed out flow plane fix it get it reclassified
[5440.88 --> 5445.76]  and certified as a experimental and then you'd have a flow plane for you know a couple hundred
[5445.76 --> 5452.40]  thousand dollars that's still a lot of money though i also wonder how often would you find years of time
[5452.40 --> 5458.16]  to reassemble it yourself yeah so the rv7 is technically considered an experimental aircraft
[5458.16 --> 5462.56]  yeah i wonder what it would take to get something uh reclassified as experimental
[5462.56 --> 5468.08]  oh you just scream it i think you'd have to substantially rebuild and fit within the
[5468.08 --> 5471.76]  requirements like the weight limits and stuff does it have to be built from nothing dealing with
[5472.48 --> 5477.92]  plane pontoons retrofit limits might be a little difficult yeah i don't know
[5479.36 --> 5483.36]  sorry i'm just signing into facebook to show you guys all of the airplanes
[5483.36 --> 5488.08]  not that i'm not enjoying it thoroughly
[5489.84 --> 5494.48]  but what what what topic is this was this a merch message i don't know who cares topic yeah what even
[5494.48 --> 5498.40]  is this show luke it doesn't matter this was you talking about starlink
[5502.08 --> 5507.20]  i have uh i've just stopped trying to pull you back on top there's no point i was just
[5507.20 --> 5512.88]  better just curious we're gonna do sponsors though so at some point at some point but we gotta we gotta
[5512.88 --> 5519.04]  stall so linus can sign into his facebook account after having to go through 700 prices uh yeah well
[5519.04 --> 5523.76]  i mean this guy basically he had like five acres behind us and he basically had a double airplane
[5523.76 --> 5529.04]  hanger on his property to rebuild these in how insane would it be to just take the wings off and
[5529.04 --> 5536.40]  park it at your house um some of them actually do have foldable wings they fold up foldable yeah um or you
[5536.40 --> 5541.44]  can take them off yeah that's a flipped over truck is that for sale are these hummels doing what i
[5541.44 --> 5547.12]  think they're doing no they're not um i didn't see that at first
[5550.08 --> 5553.20]  is that is that the pool mobile from the simpsons
[5554.32 --> 5559.36]  it's a truck it's a trade what oh i thought it was a pool yeah it looked like a pool
[5559.36 --> 5567.84]  okay okay i want this dude my face my face look at the jeep look at the flipped over jeep
[5570.88 --> 5577.76]  please what's that thousand dollar jeep i gotta know wow um actually you put some body kits on
[5577.76 --> 5582.80]  those jaguar f-types and they look sick just saying i don't like them by default do you have to go get
[5582.80 --> 5587.36]  it yourself thousand kilometers it's flipped over delete if not okay
[5590.40 --> 5595.20]  one picture you just have to go get it yourself oh my goodness it is literally just one picture
[5595.20 --> 5601.20]  that's amazing that's it you just yeah you just go get it i guess dude i told you i told you this is
[5601.20 --> 5610.08]  unbelievable i train my facebook marketplace to be just the wildest stuff i would pay money for that
[5610.08 --> 5616.24]  you could import someone's like algorithm training commercial that would be so cool um oh my god what is
[5616.24 --> 5622.80]  that definitely look at this lady definitely not creepy monkey 50
[5625.52 --> 5636.40]  probably collectible probably not man oh my goodness oh man oh this is great just incredibly
[5636.40 --> 5643.76]  weird things and then like yeah really expensive cars yeah yeah oh man this is great home business
[5643.76 --> 5649.76]  and it just shows like candy stuff here's an original series tricorder functional prop replica because
[5649.76 --> 5656.08]  yeah that makes sense for me to be shopping for i guess uh here's some stuff from uh scrapyard wars
[5656.08 --> 5662.48]  no spoilers though nope here's a 3d led dance floor sure i'll take two
[5662.48 --> 5671.04]  what is happening what is happening what the heck at least you know at least they put up a real price
[5671.04 --> 5676.24]  for it yeah i'll give them that yeah to their credit they did they didn't do that they did do that
[5676.24 --> 5685.44]  oh oh gee mcconnell stuff i don't like i don't like that i want to do some clown whippets no thank you
[5685.44 --> 5689.68]  oh my god
[5689.76 --> 5698.40]  do you want a nacho and cheese warmer oh my goodness uh anyway anyway um oh i thought it was ranch uh
[5698.40 --> 5705.52]  anyway airplanes um no i forget i forget what airplanes are under okay so here here here here i'll
[5705.52 --> 5711.84]  show you i'll show you you wouldn't believe how many planes are on facebook marketplace like here's just
[5711.84 --> 5719.12]  here's just a casual float plane dude like people put up oh beaver's a classic yeah yeah buddy oh hell
[5719.12 --> 5724.64]  yeah it's like the first time cars were listed on ebay like who's listing a 600 000 plane on facebook
[5724.64 --> 5732.40]  love me a good beaver you know that's so wild why would i put it oh my goodness dude dude what a
[5732.96 --> 5739.44]  reupholster that what a choice what a choice you could ride your harley to the dock i'm super and then
[5739.44 --> 5747.60]  ride your harley plane through the sky pontoon planes and loud motorcycles oh dude dude dude
[5748.08 --> 5759.52]  float plane 160k let's go in maple ridge bc why do they have this air why well the thing is what the
[5759.52 --> 5764.32]  cool thing about having a float plane is you just drive it on the water and then you can take off for
[5764.32 --> 5770.32]  whenever you want i mean in fairness some of these are thanks dad some of these are obviously like
[5770.32 --> 5774.88]  fake it makes it cheaper you don't have to store it in a in an airport like you can't call this a
[5774.88 --> 5786.96]  biplane if it goes three different ways oh here fixed wing ultralight can i interest you in an 1800
[5786.96 --> 5792.08]  dollar aircraft from 100 mile house would you get in this no
[5794.16 --> 5801.68]  is that how are you doing is that where you do your trimming look yeah yeah yeah yeah oh it needs
[5801.68 --> 5809.60]  some tlc just needs a tune bro just needs a tune oh my god oh my god but yeah like dude you could be
[5809.60 --> 5816.64]  flying you could be flying an aircraft for okay hold on why is that so cheap nose actuator rod broke
[5816.64 --> 5821.60]  attachment point to down lock torn off okay then oh this one needs some work okay let's find the
[5821.60 --> 5827.76]  let's find the cheapest one functional plane that just like is ready to fly beautiful well-built great
[5827.76 --> 5838.48]  reputation usd 65 000 you could literally pick this up in like 30 minutes and it works apparently
[5838.48 --> 5846.48]  like is that crazy or what that is pretty nuts that's like 60 65k 65 000 us dollars you are in an
[5846.48 --> 5852.96]  airplane now obviously this is this is like what i don't know if i want a 65 000 no that's fair enough
[5852.96 --> 5857.84]  but this is like what i was talking to you about a while back with that like that uh that lead on the
[5857.84 --> 5863.76]  gamer jet where i was like i guarantee you it's way cheaper than you think and you were like no and i was
[5863.76 --> 5870.64]  like yeah it's it seats nine and it's a million dollars and you were like what so with this and
[5870.64 --> 5877.12]  with that it's very weird the truth is the the bulk of the cost is in the operating of it yeah you got
[5877.12 --> 5881.36]  to have the hang you got unless you're unless you're working on it yourself unless you're even allowed to
[5881.36 --> 5884.96]  work on it yourself which for the experimental ones i guess you'd be able to but for like a
[5884.96 --> 5890.72]  commercial one i don't know the cost per hour of flying them is insane the engineering the fuel
[5890.72 --> 5898.64]  um but anyway i just i got i got a kick out of the fact that you can get a functioning airplane
[5899.12 --> 5906.24]  for 65 000 us dollars like literally less than a cyber truck and you would look like way less of a
[5906.24 --> 5912.24]  tool you could like take it off off the back of the cyber truck dude don't give people ideas like
[5912.24 --> 5915.52]  that you know they'll want if you drive the cyber truck fast enough down the road
[5915.52 --> 5927.20]  way does the plane break through the top of the cyber truck before you get off the end uh why don't
[5927.20 --> 5933.36]  we do sponsor spots the show is brought to you today by delete me i think we've all been there right
[5933.92 --> 5941.36]  waiting for an important call the phone finally rings and to your excitement or dread you have to listen
[5941.36 --> 5945.60]  once again to a text-to-speech voice asking you to pay duties for a package you never ordered
[5946.80 --> 5954.00]  but how did they even get your number and what can you do about it have no fear delete me is here
[5954.00 --> 5959.52]  they'll take the info that you give them and they will scour the web finding potential bad actors that
[5959.52 --> 5965.52]  have their grubby little hands on your personal identifiers then they will regularly send out removal
[5965.52 --> 5970.00]  requests on your behalf with quarterly progress reports showing you how much data was removed from the
[5970.00 --> 5975.44]  web and where from and it's not just you up to three other loved ones can receive delete me's
[5975.44 --> 5982.00]  protection as well with their family plans so go join delete me.com at delete me.com
[5982.00 --> 5988.00]  slash wan to get 20 off a plan today i fumbled that but hey i think we got the point delete me.com
[5988.00 --> 5994.16]  slash wan the show is also brought to you by zero bounce sending out an email and getting an address
[5994.16 --> 5998.80]  not found error kind of sucks it's like trying to dribble a basketball that's not pumped up enough
[6000.00 --> 6007.28]  what is this why did anyone shoot this stock foot okay it doesn't matter is it so much build up
[6007.28 --> 6011.04]  so much disappointment is this fake i'm trying to figure that out
[6012.96 --> 6018.48]  the actions in the background seem pretty believable no i think it's real i think it's
[6018.48 --> 6024.40]  i think it's just really weird stock footage so skeptical of everything now i know zero bounce
[6024.40 --> 6029.12]  lets you dribble up and down the court and minimize those turnovers they can take your existing list of
[6029.12 --> 6034.24]  email addresses and validate they're all still active leading to lower email bounce rates and
[6034.24 --> 6040.24]  your important messages landing in actual inboxes and not just spam folders they also have an email
[6040.24 --> 6044.56]  finder which can identify a valid email address using a person's name and domain in real time
[6044.56 --> 6048.96]  and outbound marketing or sales specialists dream and zero bounce also integrates with popular
[6048.96 --> 6054.24]  platforms like hubspot and zapier so it can seamlessly plug into your workflow you can save 20
[6054.24 --> 6060.64]  on any of their plans by heading to our link in the video description today finally the show is brought
[6060.64 --> 6068.00]  you by amd our latest amd ultimate tech upgrade dropped yesterday and if you're wondering yes it is as
[6068.00 --> 6077.04]  chaotic as you would expect i the highlights for me are definitely um the awkward energy it's funny i saw
[6077.04 --> 6082.88]  a lot of comments saying that the video was not that awkward it's amazing what the magic of video
[6082.88 --> 6092.00]  editing will do say the edit really made it feel not that awkward it was um it was really awkward in a
[6092.00 --> 6099.60]  bad way for probably the first like hour and a half of the shoot bad way and then it got way more awkward
[6099.60 --> 6106.00]  and it came full circle to in a good way for the rest of the shoot it was a lot of fun we we had a
[6106.00 --> 6112.40]  total blast okay uh natalie's upgrade oh well no it was it was all on me like a hundred percent like
[6113.36 --> 6116.72]  sometimes i just blurt things out and i don't know if they're gonna work
[6116.72 --> 6123.52]  and sometimes the stuff i say is super weird and then i'm just like yeah we should probably cut
[6123.52 --> 6133.44]  that in the edit the piano joke was genuinely like probably one of your your best pun jokes ever made
[6133.44 --> 6141.04]  like it got me pretty good it got me i couldn't even do the delivery of it was genuinely very good i was just
[6141.04 --> 6155.36]  like okay so if you haven't seen the video i was i was i was unpacking like this uh this keyboard and um
[6156.56 --> 6163.76]  and i was like okay everyone how do you know this is the best instrument the the number one oh man i
[6163.76 --> 6169.12]  flubbed it you did i flubbed the setup how do you know this is the number one instrument how
[6169.12 --> 6176.16]  well they don't call it a poo anno which apparently didn't land with a lot of people
[6176.80 --> 6182.24]  because they don't have like number one for p number two for have to go like for little kids
[6182.24 --> 6188.16]  but to everyone here it it made sense i thought it was really funny i assure you it made sense
[6188.16 --> 6194.08]  um anyway it was a lot of fun and as always amd are the ones making it possible and like with every
[6194.08 --> 6201.84]  upgrade amd has a giveaway to go along with it this time they're giving away one of two sapphire
[6201.84 --> 6210.16]  nitro plus amd radeon rx 9070 xt gpus and you can enter today by clicking on our link in the video
[6210.16 --> 6216.40]  description but hurry there's only a few days left all right
[6216.40 --> 6227.60]  yeah what do you want to talk about should we find some good news what do we got not much oh
[6228.40 --> 6234.00]  we have microsoft adding a free option to windows 10 extended security updates program yeah windows 10
[6234.00 --> 6240.32]  users have a new option to receive security updates beyond the october 2025 end of life the previously
[6240.32 --> 6247.20]  announced esu program allows users to pay 30 or and i think this is the free option
[6247.20 --> 6253.76]  1 000 microsoft reward points no no that's one of the old paid options oh yeah and that would give
[6253.76 --> 6259.04]  you an additional year of windows 10 security updates making it safe to keep using i guess yeah
[6259.04 --> 6267.20]  the new third option requires users to sync their pc settings to one drive via a microsoft account using
[6267.20 --> 6274.96]  the windows backup app and presumably giving up some privacy in return for updates oh this is
[6274.96 --> 6281.76]  very from the enrollment screenshot pc settings may also include installed apps and credentials pretty
[6281.76 --> 6292.48]  interesting so we've talked a fair bit in fact we had a video i think on tech quickie linus windows free
[6292.48 --> 6302.08]  about how windows is effectively um yeah here we go so this tech wiki video from five years ago
[6302.08 --> 6310.48]  is like why windows is free now it's not free but it's clear that microsoft's efforts from the late 90s
[6310.48 --> 6318.32]  and the 2000s uh to prevent people actively like aggressively prevent people from pirating windows
[6318.32 --> 6325.44]  windows have been discontinued for ages yeah at this point you literally can go to microsoft's website
[6325.44 --> 6332.08]  download a windows iso and install it on a computer and just say i don't have a product key and run
[6332.08 --> 6338.16]  windows and it will as far as i can tell other than not letting you set some personalization options
[6338.16 --> 6342.56]  background and you can still set a background by just right clicking an image and then setting as desktop
[6342.56 --> 6348.56]  background doesn't block you yeah you just can't do it in the personalization menu like as unless that
[6348.56 --> 6354.40]  workaround has been patched or whatever but the point is they just clearly don't really care and i think
[6354.40 --> 6361.68]  this is yet another illustration that they just don't care like you could have an old windows license
[6361.68 --> 6367.68]  that you've upgraded to windows 10 that they would offer to upgrade you to windows 11 if you met the
[6367.68 --> 6371.84]  hardware requirements and now they're basically even saying okay forget it don't even bother with the
[6371.84 --> 6376.08]  hardware requirements you can stay on windows 10 just please please please please please have a
[6376.08 --> 6379.84]  microsoft account because at the end of the day microsoft is going the direction of basically
[6379.84 --> 6387.04]  everybody else where it's free to use and you give up your privacy data yeah you give up your data in
[6387.04 --> 6394.80]  return so what would you do right because your choice is linux is not an answer i did hold on
[6396.56 --> 6401.12]  hold on why is linux not an answer linux is not an answer because because there's whole government
[6401.12 --> 6406.40]  switching over because you are a kid and all your friends play a game that has kernel level
[6406.40 --> 6411.76]  anti-cheat there that's why so what would you do you're running windows 10 because you like like
[6411.76 --> 6417.28]  windows 10 better and windows 11 is bad you would i would never under any circumstances run windows 11
[6417.28 --> 6425.04]  because you're a giga chad like dos dude one okay your options are run it without security updates
[6425.04 --> 6430.16]  upgrade to windows 11 or sign into your microsoft account and sync all your stuff
[6431.20 --> 6436.88]  let's say those are your three options which would you take windows 11 you would just go windows 11
[6436.88 --> 6440.56]  and just pirate it oh and then do customizations
[6442.80 --> 6446.40]  okay i didn't give you those options though so you're you play but i'm a kid so i have
[6446.40 --> 6452.88]  gained the option of pirating it you said i'm a kid um going back to when i was a kid that was a
[6455.12 --> 6460.56]  a low bar to walk over like didn't require a hop you had to step up a little bit
[6463.60 --> 6471.52]  okay uh people are questioning what dos dude one is dos dude one is not a what dos dude one is a man
[6471.52 --> 6478.24]  and we did a collab with him recently uh upgrading the storage on a macbook it was super cool
[6479.36 --> 6485.60]  all right you guys are definitely going to want to check that out okay i mean yeah i i think we are
[6485.60 --> 6490.80]  long overdue no security updates on my operating system no i think we're long overdue for like a
[6490.80 --> 6498.88]  deep loading windows episode because there's do you remember the windows 9 thing i do that guy reached
[6498.88 --> 6504.56]  out recently really yeah oh interesting yeah i'd be i'd be down to do another like apparently he's
[6504.56 --> 6510.32]  still doing stuff debloat your windows let me um i don't have an easy way to access the message now
[6510.32 --> 6516.88]  but yeah that's okay dan will email you a reminder i don't think merch message dashboard is like super
[6516.88 --> 6524.88]  super busy tonight i think he's good is that okay dan yeah thank you don't email it though thank you
[6524.88 --> 6534.00]  you thank you that's a weird way to put it um well no he just i want to do a poll i want to i want to
[6534.00 --> 6540.96]  hear from the people and i'm not giving them a custom option dan can we make a poll so windows 10 raw
[6540.96 --> 6549.76]  dog windows 10 signed in and windows 11 those are the only options so you have to pick one of those
[6549.76 --> 6556.24]  three options so do you have to buy windows 11 no because i assume that you can upgrade to it let's
[6556.24 --> 6566.88]  say you can upgrade to windows 11. windows 10 raw dog yep windows 10 signed in yep and windows 11. okay
[6567.60 --> 6570.24]  i want to know which one all right we're hitting float plane with a poll
[6570.88 --> 6575.28]  let's see it's not it's not windows 10 signed in it's windows 10 with your pc settings shared yeah
[6575.28 --> 6579.92]  yeah yeah so what we talked about like synchronizing all your crap i'm just saying it's it's more than
[6579.92 --> 6589.44]  signed in yeah okay live okay here we go here come the results oh for crying out loud uh i will find a
[6589.44 --> 6595.44]  way to do this hey look at that oh my god ah good software microsoft what is happening right now we
[6595.44 --> 6600.80]  need to get power toys on that laptop for you yeah probably yeah most people are we've got 70 of the
[6600.80 --> 6604.96]  vote right now on windows 11. yeah they're just like okay forget it i'll do it so i mean this is
[6604.96 --> 6610.64]  how this is how they eventually get you i mean i remember windows 10 raw dog for me i suspect the
[6610.64 --> 6618.88]  windows 10 raw dog people are like me you have problems would you actually you'd go no security
[6618.88 --> 6623.20]  updates oh yeah instead of going to windows 11. and then when windows 12 comes out because it's the
[6623.20 --> 6628.80]  next one after the one that's missed it's gonna be even more identified dude there's no way that
[6628.80 --> 6634.48]  windows 12 is actually good i'm using windows i'm using windows 11 on this computer and my workstation and
[6634.48 --> 6638.56]  maybe i don't hate it as much because when it first came out i didn't know how to neuter it and
[6638.56 --> 6646.24]  now i know how to neuter it and so now it's okay are you going to access the windows updates despite
[6649.04 --> 6654.16]  not supposedly being able to is that your plan are you actually just going no security my dad still uses
[6654.16 --> 6663.36]  windows 7. like why because he doesn't like the new ones but it doesn't matter though i don't like
[6663.36 --> 6668.64]  windows 11 very much i mean he doesn't like windows 10. i keep telling him do windows 10. here's my
[6668.64 --> 6674.08]  question though like i i recently did a switch to mac challenge and for the first couple of days i hated
[6674.08 --> 6681.12]  my life and then it just didn't matter like i don't use my operating system windows 10 is in my opinion
[6681.12 --> 6688.16]  the most it doesn't matter operating system microsoft has made sure but like it just doesn't matter at
[6688.16 --> 6693.84]  any point it'd be just any of them they they just i don't know man they just they don't really matter
[6693.84 --> 6700.32]  that much i even try new features yeah and they just in my opinion aren't very good so then i just
[6700.32 --> 6705.52]  don't use them so i just don't really use the microsoft stuff that comes from the operating system
[6705.52 --> 6710.00]  and it's fine like they have this new is it on this one they have this panel when you open the
[6710.00 --> 6718.32]  start menu that is like you can use microsoft link and link your phone except it like kind of sucks
[6719.68 --> 6724.16]  you know what maybe part of my thing is that i just have my like ad block built into my brain
[6724.72 --> 6729.76]  i don't even notice a lot of the annoying things about windows that one was a major change it added a
[6729.76 --> 6735.84]  whole extra like was this on windows 10 when it was 11 oh this is on windows 11 it didn't happen to
[6735.84 --> 6741.04]  this computer though so like i don't know yeah i don't know why did they make the start menu worse
[6742.08 --> 6746.96]  i mean yeah but you can fix that i mean yeah you i mean i learned how to fix everything so now it's
[6746.96 --> 6751.52]  like okay you could do that in windows 11 and have security updates that's what i mean that's what i mean
[6751.52 --> 6757.92]  like so then what luke's asking is why would you go windows 10 raw dog i'm surprised you would just be like
[6757.92 --> 6762.16]  i'll just have no security and if there's no massive windows 10 vulnerability i don't believe
[6762.16 --> 6767.12]  it is able to be tackled by roaming the internet bot things i'll just get wrecked i'm surprised by
[6767.12 --> 6776.96]  that answer dan hmm hmm at work no at home good i let my dad use windows 7
[6782.56 --> 6787.04]  i'd use windows xp okay can't you just like if i still could what's the equivalent of like
[6787.04 --> 6791.52]  window blinds these days like can you just window blinds windows 11 to windows 7 and then have him
[6791.52 --> 6796.08]  not notice like couldn't you just do that no there's a functionality thing like the the split
[6796.08 --> 6801.60]  functionality the split between control panel and like the new settings menu is getting more split in
[6801.60 --> 6806.72]  windows 11. there's just some proclivities that i don't particularly like but what does your dad do
[6806.72 --> 6810.48]  with any of that stuff come on how often does your dad go into the control panel i don't know he
[6810.48 --> 6817.84]  browses google chrome why does why does he need security updates like we don't care
[6821.04 --> 6826.00]  is this really a problem for people like do they care that much about security updates yeah uh yeah
[6827.12 --> 6832.56]  yeah i mean maybe part of it is me being traumatized by like blaster back in the day
[6832.56 --> 6839.92]  do you do you remember when you couldn't so much as install windows xp and make it to the desktop if you
[6839.92 --> 6845.60]  had like a network an active network connection before your entire computer would just be taken
[6845.60 --> 6852.24]  over by just bots that are just finding any connected pc on the internet and infecting them
[6852.88 --> 6857.20]  maybe that's because maybe because the pair of us like lived through that and we're just like eh
[6858.16 --> 6862.96]  it's fine we've dealt with this why would that be the takeaway that wasn't fine you couldn't even use
[6862.96 --> 6866.80]  the computer actually don't because we've always been fine i don't know
[6869.52 --> 6876.16]  this is like the xy thing all over again i think we should move on i'm gonna move on my guess was
[6876.16 --> 6881.20]  that most people that voted for that category were people that are leaning towards or already in the
[6881.20 --> 6888.24]  linux camp that makes sense yeah i would not expect most people to vote for no security updates
[6888.24 --> 6893.28]  nope no they didn't but like 22 i think it was 22 did yeah it was quite high like
[6896.32 --> 6900.64]  and i suspect that's people just leaning towards abandoning you shouldn't be me because there's a
[6900.64 --> 6907.12]  lot of that right now yeah i've been trying to get more and more used to alternatives you shouldn't
[6907.12 --> 6912.88]  have been working on that an operating system enough to do what me and my father do my father and i do
[6912.88 --> 6919.92]  yeah like your dad should honestly just use linux yeah he actually dual builds mint why is he even
[6919.92 --> 6926.00]  dual boot why why why why what is how does windows 7 yeah make sense here some program compatibility
[6927.36 --> 6932.56]  i mean he could triple boot or he could run a vm yeah that sounds like effort it's just easier
[6932.56 --> 6938.64]  to run windows 7. it doesn't to me it sounds easier to have a vm no i'm moving on cloudflare is
[6938.64 --> 6945.12]  changing the rules of the internet cloudflare has announced that is now blocking ai crawlers by
[6945.12 --> 6953.84]  default and is introducing a new pay per crawl model in which ai services can pay content creators
[6953.84 --> 6959.36]  to allow their content to be crawled cloudflare infrastructure and services are utilized by
[6959.36 --> 6965.36]  almost a quarter of the internet and bots and crawling traffic can significantly increase the costs of
[6965.36 --> 6971.76]  running websites and recent studies have found that more than 50 of internet traffic is ai bot driven
[6971.76 --> 6979.44]  in 2025 with projections anticipating a rise to 90 by the end of the decade yeah the internet's fake
[6979.44 --> 6985.04]  what yeah half i've known this for a while i did not know that i did not know it was that high
[6985.04 --> 6992.32]  yeah that internet theory stuff is like pretty real like half of internet traffic well yeah because
[6992.32 --> 6996.16]  i'm not even talking about internet traffic i'm talking about internet interaction right now internet
[6996.16 --> 7001.52]  traffic that's not surprising to me literally at all the internet interaction though if you spend some
[7001.52 --> 7011.84]  time on like the the dumb one letter website um and you actually like actually dive into replies and
[7011.84 --> 7019.20]  actually read stuff it's painful so much of it is fake it's painful crazy even youtube comments these days
[7019.20 --> 7025.20]  incredible amount of like back in the day it would be like the bed in his tank or whatever that weird
[7025.20 --> 7031.44]  thing was yeah uh there's a lot of spam yeah click my pussy stuff like that yeah lots of that but these
[7031.44 --> 7038.64]  days there's a ton of bob yeah bob's tank army bob's tank army that was it uh there's a ton of fake ones
[7038.64 --> 7044.16]  now it's weird it's odd watching them get in loops of talking to each other is entertaining too
[7044.16 --> 7052.00]  it's like oh this like random tweet or whatever has like a billion comments and we don't know why
[7052.00 --> 7055.60]  and then you see that there's one comment with a reply to it and they just keep replying to each
[7055.60 --> 7062.24]  other for like ever it's like okay cloudflare says that site publishers will have full control over the
[7062.24 --> 7068.24]  ai blocking and the paper crawl settings while ai services will be able to choose if they want to pay
[7068.24 --> 7074.40]  the crawling prices set by the publishers the feature is currently in private beta and cloudflare
[7074.40 --> 7082.00]  customers can apply for early access our discussion question then is how do you think lmg will utilize
[7082.00 --> 7087.76]  these new features and go we signed up for the beta we're not in it yet but we signed up for the beta
[7087.76 --> 7092.56]  just to kind of see what's going on it's interesting i think there are downsides to things like this
[7092.56 --> 7099.20]  it's not like search companies aren't going to be aware of who's turning this on um and it's not
[7099.20 --> 7106.00]  like search companies wouldn't be able to hurt your search ability um i not only do i think it's possible
[7106.00 --> 7111.84]  i think it's so likely that it's close to guaranteed that that would happen that's my vibe check right now
[7111.84 --> 7117.36]  i don't technically know but i really think that would be a thing it'd be very very easy for them to
[7117.36 --> 7124.24]  do in regards to impacting page rank however i mean they can't they can't derank everyone
[7124.24 --> 7126.88]  and cloudflare is enabling it by default
[7130.48 --> 7132.32]  yeah i think there's also like
[7134.40 --> 7139.76]  oh man i think there's a lot of interesting bits like if you block crawlers on your website
[7139.76 --> 7144.88]  because you're like you know the the three one millionth of a cent that i'm going to get per
[7144.88 --> 7150.16]  crawler interaction is not worth the money i'd rather people just actually come to my website
[7150.16 --> 7157.28]  if you do that it also opens up a really weird gambit where people could prop up a website that
[7157.28 --> 7165.60]  just copies your stuff and then they allow crawlers to come for a fee whatever else there's a lot of like
[7165.60 --> 7173.52]  this is i think this is a good route to be very clear but this is going to start a very weird interact
[7173.52 --> 7180.16]  conrad stop uh this is gonna i don't know what he's doing uh this is gonna start some really
[7181.20 --> 7187.28]  some really weird interactions on the internet um of how things work now to be clear i do not think
[7187.28 --> 7194.88]  this like ai summary no one ever has to click on a website again garbage is a good idea yeah it's not
[7194.88 --> 7200.64]  sustainable so we need something yeah if this works awesome but this could have unintended consequences i
[7200.64 --> 7206.32]  guess is what practically everything has unintended anything can be gamed yes and this will attempted
[7206.32 --> 7211.60]  to be this will people will attempt to game this and i don't know what's interesting to me i guess is
[7211.60 --> 7218.48]  that this might just be too little too late um most of the clean training data is already out there like
[7218.48 --> 7227.12]  i've heard that companies are basically like guarding they're uncontaminated by you know just ai
[7227.12 --> 7234.96]  contributions uh actual human generated training data uh which man could have really fascinating
[7234.96 --> 7240.64]  implications for like the evolution of communication because the way that we communicate with each other
[7240.64 --> 7247.12]  our our slang and our grammar it changes and evolves over time but if we've got these time capsules that
[7247.12 --> 7254.72]  we use to train ais and people are effectively using ais to process information and send it to each other i do
[7254.72 --> 7258.96]  wonder if there's going to be like a stagnation there you know how right now there's a fairly
[7258.96 --> 7265.92]  dramatic difference between written word and spoken word i don't know is there i think so oh okay sure
[7266.56 --> 7272.00]  sure i'll buy it you and i are not very good use cases for this because i think we often just write how we
[7272.00 --> 7278.00]  talk um but for a lot of people there is an actually pretty substantial gap between how they write and
[7278.00 --> 7287.36]  how they talk i'm bringing up a text chat okay who's someone i talk to uh nope two x-rated
[7293.12 --> 7293.68]  um
[7296.16 --> 7300.80]  okay okay okay okay so here's um here's a
[7300.80 --> 7307.92]  uh yeah no i think i basically just write how i talk so this is to one of the writers
[7307.92 --> 7312.64]  off hours i said one attempt it's not a good example i said one attempt but i don't know but
[7312.64 --> 7318.16]  we're just chatting on in text i know but it's you're giving an example of another person who is
[7318.16 --> 7321.12]  through their work highly incentivized to write how they talk i mean
[7321.12 --> 7328.24]  got it yeah they don't care um
[7329.68 --> 7335.44]  so i said one attempt adds a ton of scope at a time when we are objectively very busy
[7335.44 --> 7340.96]  send it away to expert and test can be done in an afternoon uh around with the tormach as a day
[7340.96 --> 7345.76]  shoot we can hash this out during work hours though hope your evening is good sorry for the slow reply
[7345.76 --> 7351.60]  be busy today so i guess i i i'm a little bit more point form in text but i i don't know yeah
[7351.60 --> 7356.08]  pretty similar like what do you mean like how different are you thinking things are it's for
[7356.08 --> 7361.04]  for a substantial amount of people it's like very different like they'll use you know they'll sometimes
[7361.04 --> 7366.08]  use different language um someone's saying professional communication yeah but this happens
[7366.08 --> 7371.92]  in non-professional settings as well this is like a thing um man who do i talk to non-professionally
[7371.92 --> 7380.32]  i don't have a social life man i got nothing uh let's see
[7387.60 --> 7388.40]  okay what do you like
[7391.60 --> 7398.40]  trying to not use the ai summary at any rate the the non the non-contaminated stuff um is basically
[7398.40 --> 7404.80]  it where i was going with that is the non-contaminated source data for training is pretty much
[7405.52 --> 7414.32]  um maximized now you you kind of can't get uncontaminated new data so i do wonder how much
[7414.32 --> 7423.04]  this is even going to slow down the actual training of ai models uh probably probably not at all but this
[7423.04 --> 7430.24]  could maybe slow down their intake of new information but even then like because there's
[7430.24 --> 7435.68]  extremely valuable companies currently popping up and their entire argument is that they have clean
[7435.68 --> 7440.88]  training data instead of junk training data um and that's off of data that's already out there a
[7440.88 --> 7447.28]  massive percentage of the internet has been farmed yeah i mean it hasn't just all of it
[7447.28 --> 7458.08]  that's a tough thing to say but likely probably uh but the the one kind of saving grace is if we're
[7458.08 --> 7464.08]  going to look at sites like house fresh yeah um new products are going to come out sure so like you
[7464.08 --> 7470.00]  would still need to crawl a site like house fresh if you want to have up-to-date product recommendations
[7470.00 --> 7474.80]  so for those of you who haven't watched every when show ever house fresh is an air purifier
[7474.80 --> 7480.32]  or lct youtube video um specialist reviewer um and we collaborated with them recently on some of
[7480.32 --> 7487.36]  the challenges that they've faced around uh being pressured by air purifier manufacturers to change
[7487.36 --> 7495.92]  their reviews and also um it's pressure that they're under financially from the decoupling of
[7496.48 --> 7501.52]  um impressions and clicks that has taken place over the last little while where people are
[7501.52 --> 7507.60]  um getting the they're getting an impression for house fresh but they're not clicking through to see
[7507.60 --> 7513.36]  an air purifier review because there's like an ai summary and they just don't have to so yeah they
[7513.36 --> 7522.40]  wouldn't be able to get information on new pages but i just wonder if they'll care i mean the ai's are
[7522.40 --> 7530.08]  so inaccurate and it also starts an arms race yeah we're just kicking off another crawlers versus anti-crawler
[7530.08 --> 7537.04]  technology i mean if anyone's gonna keep out ahead of it at cloudflare i mean if they can handle
[7537.68 --> 7542.88]  ddos on a massive scale the way that they do that's a pretty that's a pretty dedicated bunch
[7542.88 --> 7548.08]  they're the right team to be in front of it we're not sponsored by cloudflare have we ever done anything
[7548.08 --> 7553.60]  with them don't think so oh yeah okay i mean maybe yet yeah we'd be open to i'd be open to it yeah
[7553.60 --> 7558.80]  i'm open to it we've been working with them yeah in some capacity or another incredibly long time
[7558.80 --> 7565.52]  quite a long time uh yeah good luck cloudflare we're actually rooting for you on this one big
[7565.52 --> 7573.44]  time yep big time big time big time oh we have another announcement on the content side for float
[7573.44 --> 7579.52]  plane i don't know where that was supposed to transition from cool you can check out my 44
[7579.52 --> 7586.40]  minutes sit down discussion with taron uh do you wanna do you wanna bring it up maybe sure okay we
[7588.00 --> 7595.20]  yeah cool we talk about a lot of things like some high level company stuff like what the he's been
[7595.20 --> 7600.64]  doing so far because viewers don't really see most of what he's doing or what he's done since starting
[7600.64 --> 7608.72]  two years ago um we also talked about um how after yvonne met taron formally she said i have a type which
[7608.72 --> 7617.20]  was a weird um thing to hear uh it's not our most liked video but it is our most viewed video by far
[7617.92 --> 7623.28]  ahead even of the smash champs grand opening video how do we know that do we have a view counter now
[7623.28 --> 7629.76]  since when we have a ways to no no it's not there so it's not on there no oh it's a good like dislike
[7629.76 --> 7635.76]  ratio though people seem to like it yep okay we have ways of getting information well how do we how
[7635.76 --> 7640.00]  do we know are people is it just does it just seem very viewed because everyone's archiving it because
[7640.00 --> 7645.84]  they're worried it'll be taken down or like no no no it's there's our our view counts are not accurate
[7645.84 --> 7652.08]  um because technically everyone's view counts are guesses and we just haven't invested literally
[7652.08 --> 7659.68]  anything in guessing accurately but we guess similarly all the time i see so so it's
[7659.68 --> 7668.16]  comparable to our own stuff yeah oh okay so like we know that you know but like uh yeah the exact
[7668.16 --> 7674.48]  number that we have is not accurate but unless they're like extremely weird extremely unique
[7674.48 --> 7680.56]  interactions around this one particular video got it then it's probably accurate that it is high
[7680.56 --> 7687.68]  you know next week there will be two amazing linus videos um one is called i spent 24 hours with linus
[7688.32 --> 7695.52]  when did that happen it's apparently a fun day in the life of linus to see what i do on a somewhat
[7695.52 --> 7701.52]  average day how do i not remember this i thought this was in taiwan which wouldn't be a somewhat average day
[7701.52 --> 7706.24]  i don't know when it was uh and the last time we heard about this i pushed back on it because i was
[7706.24 --> 7713.52]  like there is no way because you didn't like stay in like 24 hours it's it's clickbait i mean they could
[7713.52 --> 7718.00]  have hidden in my closet i wouldn't have probably noticed yeah that seems to be it's a bit of a problem
[7718.00 --> 7725.04]  man yeah i know that that i don't think it's that um we also have the long-awaited linus reacts to
[7725.04 --> 7729.68]  staff describing their first interactions with him that's coming out monday so if you ever i'm
[7729.68 --> 7736.48]  really excited for that one if you ever wanted to see what floatplane is all about now is the best
[7736.48 --> 7743.84]  time i don't think so i think so because you can get early access to deals for lime day and amazing
[7743.84 --> 7752.64]  exclusives at lmg.gg yeah all right what do we got left we got some topics to minimize you can donate
[7752.64 --> 7758.88]  your idle bandwidth yeah what is this to help archive the internet to make sure that the internet
[7758.88 --> 7766.96]  never forgets yes redditor you slash the curious bread posted a call out on the ltd subreddit for
[7766.96 --> 7774.64]  archive team warrior archive team warrior is a is is a software set up to run inside a software set up
[7774.64 --> 7779.84]  to run inside a virtual machine that downloads sites and uploads them for archiving how it works
[7779.84 --> 7785.84]  according to the curious bread's post is that there's an irc chat where the internet archive team
[7786.88 --> 7792.72]  hand selects web pages with an expiration date they set up a list for each project you can select the
[7792.72 --> 7798.80]  project you want to support from your end it downloads the pages and after each page is done
[7798.80 --> 7804.24]  it gets sent off to the internet archive and the copy is deleted from your end lightweight
[7804.24 --> 7812.56]  late on internet usage and big impact that actually sounds very intelligently built i'm not like i
[7812.56 --> 7819.76]  shouldn't sound like i'm that surprised but that's like that's smart i like that you get to pick that's
[7819.76 --> 7827.04]  the that was the big thing for me that's really cool uh there's a link to the archive warrior virtual
[7827.04 --> 7832.80]  application page which we'll post in the i'm dumping in the floatplane chat right now i don't have the
[7832.80 --> 7838.00]  other chats open yeah we'll ask dan to do it when he's back dan just stepped away yep way to go good
[7838.00 --> 7845.36]  producer but it's uh wiki.archiveteam.org slash producing php slash archive team underscore warrior
[7846.72 --> 7854.48]  yeah i don't know i just thought that was pretty cool that is really cool yeah i am a little confused
[7854.48 --> 7859.60]  as to how it saves any bandwidth for them if i download the page and then i upload it to them
[7859.60 --> 7871.44]  maybe i thought you could explain it to me no i don't actually have an answer for that
[7876.40 --> 7880.64]  is it just that it's easier to scrape it's saving is it actually the bandwidth that is saving or is it
[7880.64 --> 7884.80]  the processing i don't know i don't see how it saves any processing either
[7884.80 --> 7890.80]  well it doesn't have to like go to those websites and try to grab the data
[7893.12 --> 7899.28]  but they have to get it from like us or we'll only use your bandwidth the only thing i can think of
[7899.28 --> 7905.28]  is that it would be down to it being hard for them yeah distributing it yeah yeah so it's it's just
[7905.28 --> 7912.16]  distributing the crawling and um and downloading of the assets in here like it says hey the reason for
[7912.16 --> 7919.92]  this is to save us bandwidth um yeah it looks like it might be a rate limiting thing okay that makes
[7919.92 --> 7926.56]  a ton of sense yeah sites often block server ips or rate limiting okay okay that that makes our notes
[7926.56 --> 7933.92]  were just uh maybe not 100 maybe a little bit a little bit confused um yeah very cool i i don't know
[7933.92 --> 7939.68]  i saw this and i was like that seems like a neat project for people to participate in um here's another
[7939.68 --> 7945.52]  neat project the u.s house of representatives has passed the big beautiful bill uh here are some
[7945.52 --> 7951.92]  rapid rapid fire tech implications tax credits for semiconductor firms that are building capacity in
[7951.92 --> 7963.76]  the u.s could rise to 35 percent from 25 percent the 7 500 ev tax credit will be gone by september 30th
[7963.76 --> 7968.40]  so if you were planning to pick up a new ev that is eligible for that tax credit you are going to want to do
[7968.40 --> 7975.44]  that pretty quick clean energy tax credits so for like wind and solar projects will be phased out by
[7975.44 --> 7982.64]  2027 which it has been speculated could result in higher energy costs in the longer term and this one's
[7982.64 --> 7989.36]  a bummer 800 megahertz of radio spectrum in about the six gigahertz range um is expected to be auctioned
[7989.36 --> 8000.88]  off by 2034 which could impact the six gigahertz wi-fi range which um is i think gonna be a mega downer
[8001.60 --> 8007.60]  for american friends that's a big yikes i was at um i was at natalie's during that tech upgrade hey
[8007.60 --> 8014.80]  thank you for your ideas no it is not the riot games launcher that caused her slow downloads
[8015.44 --> 8019.52]  yes it appears to download in chunks and then install but that was not what was happening her
[8019.52 --> 8026.00]  connection was super slow we could barely even load a web page um and there were so many ssids in her
[8026.00 --> 8035.12]  area there's like 50 that we couldn't do anything and that's on five gigahertz like i i remember the
[8035.12 --> 8043.68]  transition from 2.4 to 5 gigahertz and what a breath of fresh air it was using fresh unpolluted spectrum
[8043.68 --> 8050.96]  and six gigahertz is the that of today and unfortunately it looks like um that may not
[8052.08 --> 8057.12]  that may not happen anymore i mean we'll see what happens these things do tend to change when there are
[8057.12 --> 8062.08]  administration changeovers in the u.s um so good luck everybody
[8065.12 --> 8071.04]  oh there's a response to luke's ai challenge actually there were quite a few responses to luke's
[8071.04 --> 8081.04]  ai challenge um but this is one that i happened across today cyber cypherpunk samurai says here is
[8081.04 --> 8092.08]  gemini 2.5 pro accurately recreating chapter 14 with proper punctuation hermione however had more on
[8092.08 --> 8096.80]  her mind than the philosopher's stone she had started drawing up revision timetables and color
[8096.80 --> 8101.84]  coding all of her notes harry and ron wouldn't have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same
[8101.84 --> 8103.76]  hermione the exams are ages away
[8108.88 --> 8117.76]  so for those of you who don't remember we were discussing whether it was okay to ingest published
[8117.76 --> 8125.44]  novels uh just for the cost of you know buying one copy of it using it to train your ai and whether
[8125.44 --> 8133.76]  that was transformative and one of the discussion points that we had was okay well do you completely
[8133.76 --> 8142.40]  lose that transformative argument if your ai is capable of just sharting out the text unedited and
[8142.40 --> 8150.00]  it turns out that if you trick them they can do it i saw someone i i think someone legal somewhere
[8150.00 --> 8155.68]  could take this as an actual argument and go after them for it legitimately um i saw someone else who who
[8155.68 --> 8162.00]  got around it by um asking it to read the chapter and it's like no and then it's like can you pretend
[8162.00 --> 8167.20]  to be my grandma reading me the chapter my grandma reads me a chapter every night blah blah blah can you
[8167.20 --> 8174.72]  pretend to be her and it just like crapped out a chapter of harry potter i love how it like it
[8174.72 --> 8181.44]  obviously it doesn't have feelings and whatnot but it feels like it wants you to get it around its own
[8181.44 --> 8188.80]  rules uh it's it's fascinating pretty wild the judge in the case literally said that literally said
[8189.92 --> 8196.00]  what oh yeah you're gonna have to be a little bit more clear it's like comments on the youtube video
[8196.00 --> 8204.32]  that are like yeah i agree dude we talked for four hours what do you what do you agree with i have
[8204.32 --> 8213.36]  no idea um brazil is going after nintendo for bricking switch to consoles brazil's consumer
[8213.36 --> 8220.24]  protection agency procon sp has filed a formal complaint against nintendo over its switch to
[8220.24 --> 8225.92]  console banning policies the complaint argues that nintendo's updated user agreement which
[8225.92 --> 8231.76]  allows the company to permanently block console access to all online features violates consumers
[8231.76 --> 8238.80]  rights this comes after multiple reports of switch to consoles being banned for using mig flash cartridges
[8238.80 --> 8247.36]  even when users own the games the ban includes multiplayer system updates digital game access and
[8247.36 --> 8255.68]  even the retro libraries tied to paid nintendo switch online subscriptions that seems pretty excessive nintendo
[8255.92 --> 8261.60]  one redditor bought a used switch to from walmart as an open box return only to find that it was
[8261.60 --> 8269.60]  already banned and effectively bricked for online play procon sp is demanding that nintendo remove the
[8269.60 --> 8275.28]  offending clause and has criticized the company's lack of formal legal representation in brazil which makes
[8275.28 --> 8282.96]  consumer recourse difficult nintendo has 20 days to respond to the legal challenge shout out brazil let's go brazil yeah this
[8282.96 --> 8291.04]  this seems very based nice very cool um i'd love to see someone take up nintendo's proprietary
[8291.04 --> 8296.48]  implementation of usbc next do you have you heard about this i have heard about that that's super
[8296.48 --> 8302.88]  annoying it's not only that they are you know not helping third-party accessories work with the switch
[8302.88 --> 8311.12]  too they're blocking that it is that they are actively encrypting the communication and actively preventing
[8311.12 --> 8318.24]  third-party accessories from working there is no technical reason why the switch 2 could not use
[8318.24 --> 8325.20]  standard voltages and could not use standard protocols i promise you i'm not an engineer
[8326.16 --> 8330.88]  but what i can tell you is there if apple can do it nintendo can do it
[8330.88 --> 8339.92]  yeah unique username says and their doc sucks apparently there is one third-party doc maker
[8339.92 --> 8346.56]  that works but even they came out and said okay yeah but nothing would prevent nintendo from changing
[8346.56 --> 8353.84]  the encryption key with a firmware update so we're not like guaranteeing anything but yeah it works right
[8353.84 --> 8359.12]  now i don't know how they got it working like they must have they must have a mole in nintendo or
[8359.12 --> 8366.88]  something i i have no idea yeah um cool from brazil though the usbc thing like
[8368.48 --> 8376.40]  i don't know the rule of the law and that you use usbc stuff but i feel like it violates the intention
[8376.40 --> 8381.52]  certainly the spirit of the law yeah that's what i was looking for spirit of the law um and hopefully
[8381.52 --> 8386.40]  that you can step in on that a little bit because like everyone using the same connector but not being
[8386.40 --> 8392.96]  able to actually use it because you locked things off defeats the whole purpose um and honestly
[8392.96 --> 8397.44]  actually just makes things worse in a lot of ways so hopefully that's not allowed to continue to be
[8397.44 --> 8402.80]  a thing well and the really goofy part is like on the switch one it was no problem for you to just
[8402.80 --> 8408.32]  plug the switch one into a wall wart and use it although apparently it could like wear it out faster
[8408.32 --> 8413.76]  or something but then if you took that same wall wart and plugged it into a dock and then tried to use the
[8413.76 --> 8421.04]  switch on it like wouldn't work it's like yeah can we just not yeah like can we just not that seriously
[8421.04 --> 8429.52]  yeah why like i know you got to sell 40 ac adapters but are that like
[8431.36 --> 8433.04]  80 games not enough
[8433.04 --> 8441.52]  how much blood do you want from our stones yeah no no no i was i was thinking like no that's too
[8441.52 --> 8448.40]  cheap it's a hundred something yeah no i was converting to yes um oh boy this is interesting
[8449.12 --> 8457.20]  the supreme court in the u.s has upheld a texas law that would require id to visit
[8457.20 --> 8466.96]  some websites last friday in a six to three vote the supreme court upheld a texas law aimed at blocking
[8466.96 --> 8475.28]  minors from accessing online adult content which on the face of it sounds like a good thing i don't think
[8475.84 --> 8486.48]  most minors need to be seeing that kind of content however like many potentially well-intentioned
[8486.48 --> 8494.88]  policies and legislation this one is full of holes and no not all of them can be filled
[8494.88 --> 8497.04]  because we can't get to the websites to see it
[8501.44 --> 8507.44]  the free speech coalition had challenged the texas law due to worries about the first amendment being
[8507.44 --> 8512.72]  infringed upon justice clarence thomas stated he didn't believe that this restricts adults free
[8512.72 --> 8518.32]  speech rights saying adults have the right to access speech obscene only to minors but adults
[8518.32 --> 8525.28]  have no first amendment right to avoid age verification okay even though this is now
[8525.28 --> 8529.44]  overturning decades of precedent and has the potential to upend access to first amendment
[8529.44 --> 8533.12]  protected speech on the internet for everyone children and adults alike said samir jain vice
[8533.12 --> 8538.16]  president of policy at the non-profit center for democracy and technology um yeah
[8538.16 --> 8546.24]  this is because back in 1996 and 2004 as well as many other times there were rulings that federal
[8546.24 --> 8551.28]  law at the time said it would be unconstitutional to have restrictive measures on content filtering
[8551.92 --> 8555.92]  several websites that would be required to have this age verification check are simply
[8555.92 --> 8560.40]  not running in texas as well as in several other states because they don't want to be the ones
[8560.40 --> 8566.72]  responsible for holding people's private information like driver's licenses passports and whatever other id
[8566.72 --> 8572.48]  would be used to verify the user see that's the problem with this law is that i don't want that
[8572.48 --> 8580.96]  either the government is not doing the work to make it manageable they don't have a nationwide id
[8580.96 --> 8588.32]  program for every man woman and child that is properly administered and properly safeguarded and
[8588.32 --> 8595.68]  whatever and i'm not even advocating for that as a solution here i'm just saying that they are not doing
[8595.68 --> 8603.04]  the work and not putting in any kind of infrastructure that would enable these organizations to perform the
[8603.04 --> 8609.92]  identity and age verification checks that they are demanding that they perform they're putting all of the
[8609.92 --> 8617.44]  liability on these private enterprises all of whom are going to have to create from scratch some kind of
[8617.44 --> 8631.36]  solution to collect this information validate it and store it which is assuming they're insane i'm assuming what they're hoping if i can make a if i can try to find an argument for them right now
[8631.36 --> 8640.72]  i'm assuming what they're hoping is that the free market will make a stripe-like thing where the liability goes on a third-party company
[8640.72 --> 8646.80]  that is very highly security focused sure i mean that worked great for the credit monitoring industry
[8647.52 --> 8652.48]  equifax is awesome transunion too i love them both
[8654.08 --> 8661.52]  dude what i'm kind of transunion site is so garbage i had to they had a wrong address in my history
[8661.52 --> 8669.20]  and i i had to i like went in and tried to change it and once you try to change it oh first of all it took me like
[8670.32 --> 8676.72]  four three times on the phone with them to stop my account from just randomly locking when i would try to get into it
[8677.20 --> 8682.64]  and then we finally managed to get me into the account and then it's like a separate portal to go and like
[8682.64 --> 8688.24]  register for a change and then when i went i finally got an email saying that there was an update to my change
[8688.24 --> 8692.80]  request and then when i tried to log into it the page would error out every time i would try to go
[8692.80 --> 8697.04]  to it i still don't know what happened with that but i have never lived in edmonton
[8699.76 --> 8706.48]  it's it's been a wild saga i yeah i mean i the the thing that surprises me the thing that surprises me
[8706.48 --> 8713.20]  the most is that there wasn't one of these sites already queued up by one of the people trying to push
[8713.20 --> 8717.52]  for this bill that's the thing that surprises me is that there isn't a solution that already at least
[8717.52 --> 8722.80]  sort of exists um i don't think they've thought that far ahead there's a there's a really interesting
[8722.80 --> 8726.96]  point at the end here i think you're giving them too much credit i think this is just classic
[8726.96 --> 8734.32]  will somebody please think of the children i know but uh as elijah says at the end of this topic
[8734.32 --> 8742.80]  i swear this prawn topic comes up every month i we've talked about the texas one in particular i think
[8742.80 --> 8748.96]  like three or four times yeah this is crazy i don't have another solution to accomplish the
[8748.96 --> 8754.64]  thing that they want other than just clicking yes on a website and i don't think there is one i i don't
[8754.64 --> 8764.64]  think so either but like that's the issue is you're you're supposedly um you know anti-government overreach
[8764.64 --> 8772.88]  and anti-regulation except when it's convenient um or in this case like inconvenient like there isn't
[8772.88 --> 8780.00]  even there is no plan there's no concept of a plan for how this could possibly be implemented and look
[8780.00 --> 8785.44]  i'm not saying that the adult entertainment industry is precious and should be protected at all costs
[8786.24 --> 8791.20]  at all i'm just saying that if your argument is that they need to do this thing
[8791.20 --> 8799.52]  and you have literally no idea how you expect them to do it how do you how do you legislate that
[8802.56 --> 8807.52]  i like i can't think of another example of something this stupid and like if you're yeah because i can
[8807.52 --> 8812.16]  imagine legislating something where you don't have the answer for it i can't imagine that being a thing
[8812.16 --> 8818.40]  in a variety of scenarios but in this scenario the thing that you're trying to tell them to do
[8818.40 --> 8825.76]  is putting serious security risks on everyone involved well yeah so it's like you you kind of
[8825.76 --> 8834.48]  know the only direction that they can go in and you know that it's bad which seems not good
[8837.68 --> 8840.24]  yeah i gotta wonder what lobbyist is pushing this
[8840.24 --> 8844.96]  like who is who is asking for this i don't know
[8847.28 --> 8851.84]  genuinely unsure helen lovejoy that's the only possible thing i can think of who's that
[8852.80 --> 8858.64]  won't somebody please think of the children oh that's actually yeah that is actually here wow you're
[8858.64 --> 8865.76]  so informed am i on the simpsons i'm sure yeah yep yeah pretty pretty much i mean i haven't seen i
[8865.76 --> 8870.32]  haven't kind of watched any of the last probably 10 or 15 seasons but you and sir dank pods should
[8870.32 --> 8875.52]  sit down and chat about the simpsons there's only eight seasons that's when the show ended um why
[8877.44 --> 8882.72]  just like full of simpsons references or what i i he used to make like
[8884.96 --> 8889.92]  oh man what was it even called simpsons wave is that what it's called is it the music what is
[8889.92 --> 8895.92]  simpsons wave simpsons wave yeah like dot wav or like basically come up with this i have no idea
[8895.92 --> 8902.16]  who invented simpsons wave of dankmas dank miss that was it wasn't it oh dank pods
[8904.24 --> 8910.40]  isn't dank isn't that's what i said earlier yeah yeah i thought you said dms no no no no oh
[8911.36 --> 8915.84]  okay okay okay okay oh yeah yeah yeah yeah no no i know but i know about dank pods and loving the
[8915.84 --> 8919.84]  simpsons simpsons or whatever okay what are we what are we looking at here that's right okay
[8920.96 --> 8927.28]  yep that's a thing that exists oh this this is like this is peak stuff don't don't knock it till you try
[8927.28 --> 8936.56]  it no i yeah i okay yep that's good this is like the good part of humanity if if if all this news in
[8936.56 --> 8944.40]  the wandshow makes you feel bad about being alive any stuff like dank miss okay should restore some of it
[8944.40 --> 8953.52]  it i am i am fully unironic the art brain that that man has is amazing i he's he's great that's good
[8953.52 --> 8963.52]  stuff crump with me linus um deeply uncomfortable apple has introduced tiered commission and tax
[8963.52 --> 8970.24]  for app developers in response to the eu ruling that apple must allow app developers to use all
[8970.24 --> 8975.76]  alternate payment solutions apple has made changes to the store services fee paid by app developers
[8975.76 --> 8981.92]  in the eu the fee is now broken into two tiers and if you elect to link to outside payment options
[8982.80 --> 8990.72]  you are locked to tier one which gets only a subset of store services so tier one five percent commission
[8990.72 --> 8999.84]  on in-app purchases limited store services with the tldr being no automatic updates no search boosts
[9000.48 --> 9008.88]  no personalized recommendations no editorial features no custom product pages no insights and analytics
[9010.56 --> 9017.28]  at tier two you must exclusively use apple's payment system 13 commission on in-app purchases
[9017.28 --> 9023.76]  and you get the complete set of store services in addition apple is rolling out a new fee the core
[9023.76 --> 9030.08]  technology commission which allows apple to take a five percent bonus on outside purchases made through
[9030.08 --> 9038.80]  app store apps at the time of writing the eu commission is yet to respond but if you thought epic
[9038.80 --> 9046.88]  ceo tim sweeney would say something you're right he weighed in on x twitter saying apple's new digital
[9046.88 --> 9052.56]  markets act malicious compliance scheme is blatantly unlawful in both europe and the united states
[9052.56 --> 9059.92]  and makes a mockery of fair competition in digital markets thanks tim i feel like i always have to
[9059.92 --> 9068.32]  disclaim this i don't agree with mr tim sweeney on everything but boy do i ever agree with him on basic
[9068.32 --> 9079.68]  logic when it comes to monopolistic behavior in online marketplaces um i feel like he has been a a voice of
[9079.68 --> 9088.72]  fresh air just kind of saying what should be obvious to everyone that the emperor has been naked for years
[9088.72 --> 9096.32]  and if what microsoft was doing in the 90s and early 2000s was antitrust this is like this is like
[9096.96 --> 9106.40]  uncle trust like this is you got to be kidding me yeah okay yeah uncle trust yeah yeah like antitrust but
[9106.40 --> 9113.44]  like stronger oh like could probably beat antitrust in an arm wrestle die earlier though probably sure
[9113.44 --> 9120.72]  probably sometimes questionable on holidays heart condition yeah facebook is training meta ai with
[9120.72 --> 9122.00]  your unpublished photos
[9125.76 --> 9131.52]  last week tech crunch reported that some facebook users are seeing a pop-up when posting to stories
[9131.52 --> 9137.84]  asking if the user would like to opt into cloud processing the pop-up explains that by allowing this
[9137.84 --> 9145.44]  option facebook will generate new ideas from your camera roll like collages recaps ai resylings or photo
[9145.44 --> 9151.04]  themes for this feature to work facebook will upload media from your camera roll to its cloud on an
[9151.04 --> 9158.16]  ongoing basis according to the terms of service meta will have the right to retain and use any personal
[9158.16 --> 9162.00]  information that is shared with them wow that's pretty cool
[9162.00 --> 9168.16]  holy crap how does it keep getting worse luke
[9172.32 --> 9173.92]  billions and billions of dollars
[9179.04 --> 9179.20]  hmm
[9181.12 --> 9182.64]  i think that's a legitimate answer
[9184.00 --> 9187.28]  when is it enough like when does mark zuckerberg own enough of hawaii
[9187.28 --> 9196.32]  never i genuinely don't think that has a cap he wants all of hawaii uh i for a for people that
[9196.32 --> 9201.68]  their brain worked that way in my opinion i think it would be just like is he racist the universe he
[9201.68 --> 9202.88]  doesn't want oprah to live there too
[9206.24 --> 9208.16]  it's a valid question i think it's
[9208.80 --> 9211.92]  everyone why does he want hawaii to have only white people
[9211.92 --> 9218.00]  specifically himself actually asian too yeah i'm sure his wife would be allowed to be there yeah
[9218.00 --> 9219.12]  yeah yeah
[9220.80 --> 9222.16]  why does he feel that way don't know
[9223.60 --> 9227.04]  is it just how he is are all lizards just racist
[9228.48 --> 9231.68]  if i say that does that make me racist against lizards it might
[9231.68 --> 9233.28]  they just want to be warm
[9233.28 --> 9241.20]  species
[9241.92 --> 9244.72]  oh that's pretty good
[9245.44 --> 9245.68]  um
[9249.68 --> 9253.60]  mystery ion says you don't have to be racist to not want oprah near you
[9254.96 --> 9261.04]  i actually have no idea what her controversies are so i'm gonna stay out of that one i i don't care
[9263.76 --> 9270.00]  yeah okay let's uh probably switch over to after dark maybe we got a few merge messages today
[9270.00 --> 9272.32]  all right cool let's do that
[9279.28 --> 9279.84]  oh boy
[9279.84 --> 9282.72]  uh okay merch messages
[9282.72 --> 9288.16]  after dark there's there's to hold on there's there's 12 500 people watching live on youtube
[9288.16 --> 9291.76]  presumably there's some stragglers who still watch on twitch for some reason
[9291.76 --> 9297.28]  um there we got like five probably not for long probably thousands more watching on float plane i have
[9297.28 --> 9306.48]  to ask you this the honest question okay do you guys tune in weekly so that you'll be there the moment my
[9306.48 --> 9314.40]  career ends is that the idea i think a lot of people used to that's why i arrive every week i think i think
[9314.40 --> 9319.76]  there was a period of time where that was like absolutely a very significant part of it um
[9321.36 --> 9322.96]  yeah so
[9325.12 --> 9330.56]  i gotta i don't know if that's as much of a thing anymore but i i know that was a thing people at the
[9330.56 --> 9337.36]  company used to watch well now we tell them what we tell people online during the wandshow but people
[9337.36 --> 9343.20]  also watch to be like is there going to be a work to come back to do i have to come to work to monday
[9343.20 --> 9348.80]  do i have to come to work monday do i have to come to work monday um i came across this on the subreddit
[9348.80 --> 9358.72]  recently yeah i've seen this this was funny um i had never actually re-watched the clip really i mean
[9358.72 --> 9364.96]  dude do i really have to like relive dude i thought it was so i watched like so many reactions i thought
[9364.96 --> 9381.28]  it was so funny i had a great time with this this guy this guy's face
[9381.28 --> 9398.48]  so i they were very funny so i i watched i i i had to sit through the agonizing it's so
[9398.48 --> 9404.80]  long it's like it's not actually that long it's like two minutes but it feels like forever but it
[9404.80 --> 9410.16]  feels like a lifetime imagine imagine how long that felt for me in the moment
[9415.36 --> 9419.36]  i'm ragging through my brain like am i even right about this like because there's no way he would
[9419.36 --> 9427.60]  say that i'm trying to like yeah it's uh like we were actually like the fact that you knew because i
[9427.60 --> 9434.48]  don't always monitor chat so like oh that wasn't from chat monitoring no no i know i know i'm just saying
[9434.48 --> 9440.80]  i don't always monitor chat so if you hadn't known yeah yeah we would have been like we could
[9440.80 --> 9447.28]  have made it to the end of that episode and then once we once we stopped airing back was not an
[9447.28 --> 9453.76]  option there was no way yeah there was no way yeah just like yeah it was tough you know though i i
[9453.76 --> 9458.56]  actually i look back at that like fairly fondly and i i like watching reactions to it and stuff you
[9458.56 --> 9464.08]  know what does suck though yeah it's people that'll recognize me in public and be like oh the the hard
[9464.08 --> 9471.92]  art thing that's actually why are you saying this i don't get that that's all tick tock knows us from
[9471.92 --> 9476.80]  that's what people know me from all my most viewed stuff is that clip
[9478.56 --> 9485.04]  so like it will genuinely i'll be in an airport and someone will walk up to me with hundreds of
[9485.04 --> 9492.64]  people walking by and be like oh the hard art thing wow that was crazy i'm like wow i really don't want
[9492.64 --> 9500.80]  this right now please stop like it happens at conventions it happens at airports what like
[9502.48 --> 9506.96]  like if it's just us sure but it's never just us
[9506.96 --> 9511.36]  i didn't have my face shown
[9514.64 --> 9522.32]  it's rough man yeah and then like the stuff that comes after luke luke hardar left vrenier
[9526.08 --> 9529.68]  the stuff that comes after it where they're like oh like i can't believe you saved that whatever
[9529.68 --> 9535.92]  that part is always said at a significantly lower volume yeah than the initial bit you scream that
[9535.92 --> 9543.20]  first bit yeah yeah like it actually happens a lot it's very disturbing i don't know when people are
[9543.20 --> 9549.68]  just gonna yell hard r at me it's the guy it's a hard r guy public yeah as long as you're not in the
[9549.68 --> 9557.60]  states you're probably okay it's not like in terms of people understanding it yeah yeah but like in america
[9557.60 --> 9563.44]  if i was just like hanging around and someone referred to me like that real loud i probably
[9563.44 --> 9568.16]  wouldn't be stoked on it no it's not comfortable yeah like at all
[9571.92 --> 9580.00]  yeah i uh yeah it is hilarious though i do like anytime anyone links me a like uh somebody reacting
[9580.00 --> 9586.00]  to it or talking about it whatever i i love it i thought moist charlie's moist criticals his was
[9586.00 --> 9592.00]  hilarious highlight of my career yeah did you ever watch that one i got to mike wikowski it just no
[9592.00 --> 9598.24]  tiny little tiny little postcard of my head it's great let me see if i can find it can't be that
[9598.24 --> 9604.96]  yeah linus tectips almost ruined his career he was like hours it was really fast he was really i mean
[9604.96 --> 9611.68]  he just normally is really fast oh yeah but yeah this one was so funny uh he talks about how he was what
[9611.68 --> 9615.12]  you should go watch it if you're interested but he talks about how he's watching he's been apparently
[9615.12 --> 9621.68]  watching for a long time like just the channel and he was just like sitting there just like oh no
[9623.28 --> 9624.24]  it's all over
[9626.88 --> 9633.04]  i haven't watched it forever but his his recount of this was genuinely hilarious um it was also fun to
[9633.04 --> 9641.20]  hear him say that because i i first saw his channel when i was in university so like uvic university like
[9641.76 --> 9646.40]  so that was kind of a cool crossover thing but yeah it's very very funny um
[9648.16 --> 9651.60]  anyways we're still here yeah for now
[9655.20 --> 9657.68]  dork here dork here people have tried to cancel us
[9659.20 --> 9661.28]  he didn't he didn't try to cancel no no i know yeah
[9661.28 --> 9670.56]  oh man brb gonna fall down the reaction rabbit hole it's pretty funny it's yeah i i it's pretty good
[9672.32 --> 9672.80]  all right
[9675.12 --> 9686.40]  dan yeah hit me okay hello dynas duke and lan i just got into hockey recently and i know you nice linus had
[9686.40 --> 9691.12]  made a joke about being a fan of the oilers before but what are your favorite teams let's go kraken for
[9691.12 --> 9697.60]  me um to me picking my favorite hockey team is like picking my favorite corporation um because they
[9697.60 --> 9704.72]  literally that's what they are they literally like very literally are corporations so you're just like
[9706.16 --> 9712.80]  when you when you buy the merchandise you are supporting you know a lot of the really positive
[9712.80 --> 9717.76]  things that sports teams do bring to their communities they bring people together they
[9717.76 --> 9724.32]  often contribute to their communities charitably like um canuck place uh here in vancouver does a
[9724.32 --> 9732.56]  lot of really great work um you are contributing to the livelihoods of not just the the players that play on
[9732.56 --> 9738.96]  the team but also the the farm system that filters up to the big league teams um there's a there's a lot of
[9738.96 --> 9744.64]  you're contributing to the businesses that rely on you know people leaving the stadium after the game
[9744.64 --> 9751.44]  to go get dinner or drinks or whatever it is there there's a lot of really positive things about sports
[9751.44 --> 9761.20]  ball um but you are also funneling money into the pockets of multi gazillionaire owners and you're doing
[9761.20 --> 9768.00]  that at a greater rate than you are probably any of the other things um and so for me
[9768.00 --> 9777.52]  um i really enjoy the sport i am a fan of hockey i love the tension i love the incredible talent of
[9777.52 --> 9788.88]  um just amazing amazing players um i i i i i i love the speed of the game the intensity i i i can
[9788.88 --> 9797.76]  appreciate the talent and the hard work and dedication that goes into being so so very good at it um but i have
[9797.76 --> 9805.12]  a real hard time being that invested in a team so for me a big part of the joy of watching hockey is
[9805.68 --> 9810.00]  watching you know with someone who's really passionate about someone so i'm at a point now
[9810.00 --> 9816.24]  where i can kind of cheer for whatever team so i just get behind whatever whoever david gautier wants to
[9816.24 --> 9823.76]  win it was genuinely more fun watching the finals because he was there oh yeah david's so passionate and
[9823.76 --> 9829.60]  he's very well informed not just about the game itself but like all the players and their their
[9829.60 --> 9835.52]  like history and like you know whether whether they're you know dirty players or whether they're
[9835.52 --> 9840.32]  people that we can feel good about cheering for him like rant about that one guy was was i don't
[9840.32 --> 9845.20]  remember his name but it was it was cool i yeah i have no interest in watching on my own i
[9845.20 --> 9855.52]  i absolutely i don't generally like tv shows i love shorzy um and that's like about a hockey team
[9856.72 --> 9865.04]  so that's cool i i've been considering trying to like recruit a couple people to also do this with me
[9865.04 --> 9871.28]  because i'm not interested in just doing it by myself but the like kind of local hockey team trying
[9871.28 --> 9875.68]  to get season tickets for that some year and like actually trying to go to every game i think could
[9875.68 --> 9884.08]  be kind of fun um by local hockey team i do not mean the canucks um yeah i also i really like you
[9884.08 --> 9890.24]  know interesting storylines like i was uh i i was rooting for the oilers because i don't know they're
[9890.24 --> 9897.60]  the canadian team or something uh last year and but i was also pretty happy to see paul maurice lift the cup
[9897.60 --> 9906.16]  uh this was the very unfortunate record that he had last year until he won he had the most wins
[9906.96 --> 9914.24]  of an nhl coach without having a cup just like you could be like the greatest coach that never
[9914.24 --> 9920.24]  actually lifted the winningest without championship coach is not the thing that you want to go down for
[9920.24 --> 9925.68]  no it really isn't yeah so i you know felt pretty good for you know for him for finally getting there
[9925.68 --> 9932.88]  um and this year i just i really you know you saw all the passion from you know dry sidle and mcdavid i
[9932.88 --> 9936.56]  really wanted to see them lift it they couldn't get it done maybe next year we'll have to see how the
[9936.56 --> 9943.36]  offseason goes um yeah i love the game don't love the the corporateness of it i stopped following super
[9943.36 --> 9949.76]  hard uh back in the i forget which lockout there was there was a lockout and it was basically like i was
[9949.76 --> 9955.68]  just as a fan i was just kind of tired of like millionaires versus billionaires this this crashed
[9955.68 --> 9960.00]  out a lot of people that i know from watching and i just didn't care who was right anymore at that
[9960.00 --> 9966.80]  point yeah um i was just not interested anymore was it 2011 i don't remember exactly but i i know i i
[9966.80 --> 9971.76]  used to know quite a few people that would watch and like almost all of them stopped watching after
[9971.76 --> 9979.44]  that to be honest just 2012 2013 was the was the lockout it canceled many of the games of the 2012
[9979.44 --> 9983.68]  season including the all-star game and shortened the regular season to just 48 games what was that
[9983.68 --> 9989.84]  tournament they did this year that was incredible okay that was like peak sports new answer the um
[9989.84 --> 9999.44]  four nations face off um whoa dude that was like that was it's amazing how much harder the players play
[9999.44 --> 10006.48]  yeah with their country flag on their chest versus some corporate logo and it really shows us what
[10006.48 --> 10014.08]  we're missing by having hockey as this like corporate behemoth rather than um as like a like an
[10014.08 --> 10019.76]  international the four nations tournament even if you're not into hockey at all it was a fantastic
[10019.76 --> 10027.12]  watch it's like the best hockey you can watch and every player was going for it every time like like
[10027.12 --> 10033.04]  it was kind of crazy that was that was fascinating that was my favorite hockey thing that's happened
[10033.04 --> 10038.72]  in like maybe ever yeah i'd love to see them bring that back i i don't know if they're committed for
[10039.28 --> 10044.80]  next year but i think seeing the success of the format they they they like it i i'm just i'm just
[10044.80 --> 10048.08]  worried there's going to be like too many injuries or something and they're going to shut it down
[10048.08 --> 10051.68]  right i know that i think they're not doing it next year because it's an olympic year isn't it
[10051.68 --> 10056.24]  i think it's a winter olympic makes sense but if they did it on non-olympic years that would be cool
[10056.24 --> 10063.44]  i'd be super into that yeah four nations face off was amazing okay okay let's see what else we got
[10063.44 --> 10070.16]  next hello from tasmania australia wow hi linus as you get older do you expect your viewer demographics
[10070.16 --> 10076.64]  to age with you do you worry about young newbies in the tech field shunning you in your 40s um it's
[10076.64 --> 10082.00]  something that i've thought about a fair bit actually i mean i think that i've talked extensively
[10082.00 --> 10089.60]  about what i call the curve which is kind of a natural fizzle out of not just like online you
[10089.60 --> 10096.24]  know internet famous people but pretty much anyone with cultural relevance like you you can't keep it
[10096.96 --> 10104.32]  forever and depending on what kind of a space you're in or um you know whether you're uh whether
[10104.32 --> 10111.92]  you're a man or a woman or what kind of like uh what kind of role people can imagine you in like
[10111.92 --> 10119.20]  you think about happens a movie star yeah absolutely absolutely like you get kind of typecast so if i'm
[10119.20 --> 10126.72]  typecast as like you know the young geeky tech guy and then i grow out of it and i'm like an old guy
[10126.72 --> 10133.20]  that still talks like this like that's i that probably won't work for people formats change um something
[10133.20 --> 10140.24]  that i have not really had a you know a strong presence in is short form content um there's a
[10140.24 --> 10146.32]  whole tech talk that occasionally you know clips of me will end up on or whatever else we we have some
[10146.32 --> 10151.28]  of our own content that we upload there but i wouldn't say that we're a dominant force by any stretch
[10151.28 --> 10157.68]  of the imagination when it comes to short form um you know everything changes nothing ever stays the same
[10157.68 --> 10166.72]  and um aging out of this career has absolutely been something that i've thought about a lot but what
[10166.72 --> 10176.72]  we're also seeing is that while i think the audience is aging up with me a fair bit um it's not as bad as
[10176.72 --> 10186.48]  i kind of always assumed that it was going to be um we're still like heavily skewed in the 18 to 24
[10186.48 --> 10199.52]  uh 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 ranges which from an advertising standpoint is like ideal um young men with
[10199.52 --> 10208.48]  disposable income is pretty much your like optimal demographic target um and while we don't have one
[10208.48 --> 10216.32]  of the most sustainable uh verticals necessarily like financial advice for instance has like crazy cpms and
[10216.32 --> 10222.48]  stuff like that there's a tech is really not that great for verticals yeah uh so we don't have that
[10222.48 --> 10229.28]  going for us like automotive cpms are apparently much higher uh what we do have is a really stable
[10229.28 --> 10235.52]  oh go ahead they talk about that there's a big time has a video on like it's been one year since we
[10235.52 --> 10240.48]  left donut what's it like yeah and they they're they actually like it's a very
[10240.48 --> 10246.48]  much more open video than i think most people would make um and they they show one of their
[10246.48 --> 10250.72]  dashboards at some at one point and show like their kind of cpms and they explain how it works
[10250.72 --> 10254.08]  and they explain how like youtube takes their cut and all this kind of stuff and it's it's really cool
[10254.08 --> 10263.52]  actually it's a good video um i would say the there is a bit of a shift occurring um so we are 41.4
[10263.52 --> 10275.52]  24 25 to 34 20 35 to 44 and 24 and a half percent 18 to 24 so that is all that remains is like 10
[10276.08 --> 10283.04]  outside of those ranges but i do think that google's doing a better job of filtering out um like garbage
[10283.04 --> 10289.52]  data so i suspect it's always been a little closer to that and we are aging up a little bit into 25 to 34
[10289.52 --> 10296.00]  but i'd say given i'm gonna be 39 pretty soon if we're still managing to speak to
[10297.12 --> 10304.64]  65 percent an 18 to 34 audience we're actually still doing a pretty okay job and given that we still
[10304.64 --> 10311.92]  have 30 of our audience 35 and up we also aren't completely losing the more mature audience either
[10312.64 --> 10318.64]  i think more of that is probably not related to you and i think more of that is probably related to
[10318.64 --> 10323.68]  our format because we don't cater heavily to short form we do cater to short form sammy does a great
[10323.68 --> 10331.84]  job but we don't cater our primary content is long form which is aging up yeah that's true and i think
[10331.84 --> 10339.20]  there's just that our focus is computer hardware which i would argue is aging up as well i don't
[10339.20 --> 10344.40]  necessarily think it's super related to you personally and there's uh and there's like
[10344.40 --> 10352.00]  socio-economic factors that are contributing to this like it is harder for uh you know a 17 year
[10352.00 --> 10359.60]  old to buy a brand new gaming computer today than it was when i was a kid yeah um not just in terms of
[10359.60 --> 10365.52]  like raw dollars like in terms of purchasing power and typical disposable income it's much more difficult
[10365.52 --> 10373.52]  um so i can totally understand why a lot more younger people would gravitate towards console gaming for
[10373.52 --> 10383.84]  instance okay up next finished all medical training now leaving the incredible friends i went through
[10383.84 --> 10390.40]  hell with over the past five years and it sucks what's the hardest goodbye you've had to say and how did you
[10390.40 --> 10400.24]  handle it oh hardest goodbye are we're not talking deaths right oh i think i don't think so oh really
[10401.36 --> 10406.48]  no they left school i think that's probably a little they're all going their own ways it's a little too
[10406.48 --> 10414.80]  far um man i don't know if i've i don't know about hardest goodbyes i've had i've had a few moderately
[10414.80 --> 10424.40]  difficult goodbyes like when i did my uh when i did my six-year exchange um to quebec not only was i
[10424.40 --> 10430.08]  saying goodbye to all the people who effectively like taught me french and i spent every day with
[10430.08 --> 10437.28]  while i was there uh as like a summer camp counselor but i like i literally i think i think like the terms
[10437.28 --> 10441.76]  of the exchange like there was no personal information to be exchanged or something like
[10441.76 --> 10448.80]  i was literally saying goodbye forever um so that was like kind of weird an old school problem like
[10448.80 --> 10456.64]  i hadn't really i hadn't really like encountered that before um i don't think i had a super strong
[10456.64 --> 10463.52]  attachment to anyone in high school anyone that i like didn't you know maintain an attachment with
[10463.52 --> 10467.68]  yeah like there it wasn't really like goodbye it was more just like fade away that's one of the issues
[10467.68 --> 10471.76]  i'm having is a lot of the situations that i have left like what about your teams
[10473.84 --> 10478.96]  like you know you you went to provincials for like football and hockey and stuff like was there ever
[10478.96 --> 10483.92]  like a goodbye moment with your teams that you were like i'm never gonna see you guys again that you
[10483.92 --> 10490.40]  it was less in my opinion like those teams because the the team you'd go play with for provincials is
[10490.40 --> 10495.76]  not the team that you would naturally i think is not the team that you would play with throughout the
[10495.76 --> 10500.08]  season because they would take a like all-star team from all the different oh i didn't know that
[10500.08 --> 10505.20]  teams in bc for ball hockey that's how it worked interesting um and then and then you'd go travel
[10505.20 --> 10511.84]  and play wherever um so like that group i was never usually like that tight-knit with that group right
[10511.84 --> 10515.84]  it was more of the team throughout the season and the team throughout the season even a lot of times
[10515.84 --> 10524.48]  you'd see the same players kind of year after year and um so it's like a slow roll yeah what did really
[10524.48 --> 10533.12]  really really suck was the very last year because you turn whatever and then you're not eligible 18
[10533.12 --> 10539.84]  or whatever it is and you can't play on those sports teams anymore and the jump to adult teams a lot of
[10539.84 --> 10549.92]  them don't exist yeah or the vibe is like completely different yeah that makes sense um like football oh yeah
[10549.92 --> 10556.00]  adults are not going to want to like get injured no like no turns out people do play rugby i didn't
[10556.00 --> 10561.60]  know about that until like way later um but yeah football not so much of a thing there's like one
[10561.60 --> 10567.60]  team if i remember correctly but they were super serious and they really kind of wanted to be this
[10567.60 --> 10572.56]  is extremely old information it could be wrong even from back then uh but they they wanted to be kind
[10572.56 --> 10577.92]  of like the house team for the lions like they were like trying to make it they weren't just playing for fun
[10577.92 --> 10583.44]  right seriously playing for fun like i like obviously i'm gonna give it but like i'm also
[10583.44 --> 10588.08]  not trying to be a professional football player so like there's a difference yeah between trying as
[10588.08 --> 10592.64]  hard as you can and trying to be a professional football player there is a difference yeah um so
[10592.64 --> 10597.44]  like certain sports they just didn't have teams other sports the vibe was completely different like i
[10597.44 --> 10604.48]  would still like to practice right most adult teams don't practice so you want the like football
[10604.48 --> 10609.36]  equivalent of like a badminton club like we're running where you can go and you can do training
[10609.36 --> 10614.24]  yeah i think so you can like play and compete in like ladder games or whatever but like even if it
[10614.24 --> 10620.00]  was just the practice i would love that football practice was sick pushing bags around and stuff
[10620.00 --> 10625.52]  was really fun um and there's even like i've been looking into getting into ice hockey we couldn't do
[10625.52 --> 10632.88]  ice hockey when i was a kid equipment's too expensive um thanks uh i do pretty well now um so i could i
[10632.88 --> 10639.04]  thank yourself i could get some hockey equipment if i wanted some hockey equipment um but like i can't
[10639.04 --> 10646.64]  skate at all yeah like literally at all yeah yeah it's pretty sad it's a problem like i can't skate
[10646.64 --> 10654.16]  and like you're trash yeah so like i'm i can't just go join a team i mean david offered to kind of
[10654.16 --> 10660.64]  um hold our hands next year i want to do that i'm kind of down i'm totally down okay should we do it yeah
[10663.68 --> 10668.24]  okay all right we're doing it next season so david's got to recover i don't think you guys have
[10668.24 --> 10673.68]  seen any content yet but his wing is uh pretty busted right now yeah which is not a good sign
[10676.32 --> 10681.92]  but he's also a unit he's playing he can probably take some damage he's playing a league above what he
[10681.92 --> 10687.28]  so apparently he can kind of he's allowed to play in a lower league if he's kind of like chaperoning us
[10687.28 --> 10692.64]  and we suck kind of thing and he doesn't like balance score too many goals and stuff yeah um so
[10692.64 --> 10698.96]  he offered we would have to come in at the bottom yeah like i was good at ball hockey and 20 years ago
[10700.00 --> 10706.64]  i'm a great rollerblader oh dude i was really good at rollerblading terrible ice skater when i was 12.
[10706.64 --> 10713.92]  yeah i have not done that ever since you know those the crosswalk bars no you don't talk can i
[10713.92 --> 10718.24]  find an image of this okay in the meantime i wanted to address something real quick unique username asks
[10718.24 --> 10722.08]  how do you mean you couldn't get back in touch like literally forbidden from exchanging contact
[10722.08 --> 10729.20]  deals i was a minor so i think it was like a thing um and then there was one other thing that i was going to
[10729.20 --> 10736.48]  answer and i forget what it was oh yeah the hardest goodbyes um probably the hardest ones for me
[10737.04 --> 10745.36]  were um employee employment terminations um here so like some of the ogs and when i say termination i don't
[10745.36 --> 10750.64]  mean fired i'm not saying if they quit or were fired that's none of your business um but just like people that
[10751.44 --> 10759.12]  um because there's some that like you know i'm still in touch with and like you know it's chill like taryn and i tech not my boss
[10759.12 --> 10763.84]  taryn the other taryn we text once in a while like brandon came to movie night the other week like
[10763.84 --> 10768.56]  there's people that i'm still in touch with but and we do our best to kind of part on good terms but
[10768.56 --> 10774.08]  breakups are always complicated and emotional and sometimes you know they're not going to be on good
[10774.08 --> 10780.16]  terms so those goodbyes can be really hard because these are again people that you work with for a long
[10780.16 --> 10786.00]  time um a lot and sometimes very intensely there's a lot of bonding that takes place it's really good
[10786.00 --> 10795.20]  i can't find an image so i have come up with a a terrible way you really truly have
[10797.20 --> 10802.00]  if the goal was terrible you did it and do you step in them
[10803.28 --> 10806.80]  like a cross there's like one here and there's like one here
[10806.80 --> 10815.60]  and it's a cross it's not a crosswalk i said the wrong term it's like uh like a in in suburbia
[10815.60 --> 10821.52]  it's like a trail between houses or whatever oh like a pathway that's a pretty good picture of those
[10821.52 --> 10827.28]  the vehicle blocker thing that's a really good path yeah yeah walking path not crosswalk i just said the
[10827.28 --> 10834.88]  wrong word we're gonna put it on the fridge gold star that's a pretty yeah okay so those bars you know
[10834.88 --> 10840.08]  how there's like a middle bar and then the high bar and then they so when i used to rollerblade
[10840.08 --> 10846.16]  all the time i would deliver newspapers yeah speed was of the essence and when i was rollerblading but
[10846.16 --> 10851.68]  not delivering newspapers or if i like had a few to deliver through one of those walkways so i'd like
[10851.68 --> 10856.72]  leave my big thing of newspapers and just go with a little bit and try to go really fast um i wouldn't
[10856.72 --> 10861.28]  want to weave around those because they would slow me down so i came up with a way that i could if i
[10861.28 --> 10869.44]  jumped i could get the the middle of my four wheels i could lodge it on the the bar and then lift
[10869.44 --> 10875.20]  myself up a little bit and get the middle of my other foot's four wheels on the top bar and toss myself
[10875.20 --> 10883.36]  over and just like vault them bloody hell you shouldn't do that so i did that every week for years and it was
[10883.36 --> 10888.40]  awesome don't try it again my brother and i were both like oh no dude i might die
[10888.40 --> 10895.92]  my brother and i were both very good uh yeah it was awesome and then i haven't done that genuinely
[10895.92 --> 10902.88]  since i was like a very early teenager good so if i tried i have a feeling if i tried to stop now i
[10902.88 --> 10909.52]  would biff super hard i literally can't find a picture of that yeah why like is that just so hard
[10909.52 --> 10914.64]  to search for is that not a thing i don't know okay well anyway i'm sure there's a proper term for it
[10914.64 --> 10922.80]  all right dan dan you were not there at the time please don't answer this for luke and linus
[10923.92 --> 10929.20]  uh okay if the company was now still as small as it was five or six years ago do you think people
[10929.20 --> 10934.96]  would have better opinions of you that's a good question five or six years ago we were a lot smaller
[10934.96 --> 10941.60]  um i think it'd go a little bit of both ways i think there's a certain amount of inherent
[10941.60 --> 10951.12]  um i think there's and it depends on the person like some people will respect someone more the
[10951.12 --> 10956.80]  bigger their businesses or like whatever um regardless of how good of a person they are
[10957.44 --> 10963.28]  like you look at the way we hold someone like steve jobs in super high regard like the guy's personal
[10963.28 --> 10972.56]  life was a dumpster fire like he was such an asshole like you know and nobody even disputes it like it's
[10972.56 --> 10981.20]  not like it's it's not like people are like no he didn't completely like mistreat his partner and child
[10981.76 --> 10990.88]  it's like yeah but apple he did amazing things yeah like it's uh like it's this sort of bizarre issue that
[10990.88 --> 10994.96]  i've talked about in the past but i think we're doing a really poor job of choosing our male role
[10994.96 --> 11001.20]  models it's kind of what i think it boils down to um i think we sort of always have fair enough i mean
[11001.20 --> 11007.28]  we call him alexander the great and he literally i don't know if he came up with decimating good but
[11007.28 --> 11011.68]  he certainly did a fair benefit yeah um yeah anywho
[11011.68 --> 11022.96]  but on the flip side i think there's people that inherently feel worse about someone the more
[11023.84 --> 11032.00]  wealth they accumulate which i can also see the perspective of especially now as we're hitting like
[11032.00 --> 11040.32]  quite a peak of wealth disparity yes and uh we're ramping up into an unaffordability crisis that is
[11040.32 --> 11050.72]  impacting almost literally everyone um like on earth um with that said my son lives there have
[11051.68 --> 11057.04]  sorry tenant have you been have you been following what's been going on with uh property i sent you an
[11057.04 --> 11062.00]  article today you do i have not oh yeah you should well i mean a little bit but not enough you should
[11062.00 --> 11067.20]  you should read it let me let me put it i've been a little busy last few weeks let me put it this way
[11067.20 --> 11074.72]  um the crash that i've been rooting for for some time that i think will help significantly
[11074.72 --> 11081.52]  alleviate some of the pressure that uh people in the vancouver area have been feeling we appear to be
[11081.52 --> 11087.68]  on the precipice like we're we're already over the we're already over here and it seems like it seems
[11087.68 --> 11093.12]  like the trajectory is this way i'm so excited people keep saying this argument to me and i don't have
[11093.12 --> 11098.48]  anything substantial to counter it with but they're they're like oh yeah everybody's just waiting and
[11098.48 --> 11103.44]  then like when the market drops like a couple percent which is an enormous amount in the housing
[11103.44 --> 11110.32]  market um they're just all gonna rush and buy and my my constant gut feeling is like who dude
[11110.32 --> 11114.88]  corporations who are these people they're gonna buy up all the cheap housing because there's a
[11114.88 --> 11120.40]  demographic shift happening at the same time like dude there's so many businesses for sale on facebook
[11120.40 --> 11131.92]  look i buy one with a jet two for one your facebook marketplace is as i really really oh it'll
[11131.92 --> 11135.84]  never happen but it'll be so wonderful like if i could just copy your algorithm and put it in mine
[11135.84 --> 11140.32]  because i would just i want that as its own website yeah i would linus's facebook marketplace
[11140.32 --> 11144.88]  is a website i would go to i know i didn't speak directly to mike you can't hear that but like
[11144.88 --> 11154.08]  man you see businesses not not haunted monkey two million dollar jet just an entire business
[11154.08 --> 11158.24]  do you want to buy a kroger for 26 000 she's a nacho heater
[11160.64 --> 11170.72]  like it's actually amazing cursed gatorade so there's a lot of businesses okay for sale on facebook
[11170.72 --> 11175.84]  because boomers are retiring and there's like literally no one to buy them so they're cheap
[11175.84 --> 11182.24]  right so people are able to buy these things for like 1x ebita and like if they have some startup
[11182.24 --> 11187.20]  capital which is a real challenge because they haven't had an opportunity in their life any money
[11187.20 --> 11191.36]  so they like have to inherit it yeah to build up a nest egg or credit worthiness but you could just
[11191.36 --> 11197.44]  borrow against your house oh no wait wait no that's like real though yeah that's how a lot of it's get
[11197.44 --> 11204.56]  started right so it's uh so it's gonna take some time but i think we are and the problem is that
[11204.56 --> 11211.04]  heading into this is going to be really painful in other ways like it's going to be a boon to people
[11211.04 --> 11217.84]  who are who have managed to save and we're just waiting for things to get ever so slightly more affordable
[11218.40 --> 11222.64]  but it could also be deeply problematic for people who are a little bit lower
[11222.64 --> 11231.52]  on the social ladder rungs and have not managed to accumulate the um the the down payment that they
[11231.52 --> 11236.88]  need and whose employment could be impacted by the economic hardship that's going to take place and
[11236.88 --> 11244.72]  the like everything's oh why is everyone show bad news when show it's almost like it's a reflection of the world
[11244.72 --> 11247.76]  oh no wait that's worse
[11251.36 --> 11255.60]  irish luck asked what is what is ebitda um
[11256.72 --> 11262.40]  and a bit hold on it's a really fun word that doesn't seem to mean anything it stands for earnings
[11262.40 --> 11270.56]  before interest taxes depreciation and amortization it basically it tells you how much money a company makes
[11270.56 --> 11276.96]  um excluding any effects of financing taxes and non-cash accounting practices so it's like uh
[11276.96 --> 11285.12]  like theoretically a no bullshit like how profitable is this business theoretically yeah big theoretically
[11287.92 --> 11295.68]  but there's always creative accounting yep hit me dan hi linux cbas
[11295.68 --> 11302.00]  yes do you feel burnt out due to the increased workload as chief vision officer compared to the
[11302.00 --> 11307.20]  time that you were thinking of retiring do you feel more tired this time well i never get younger
[11308.32 --> 11316.24]  which it turns out is a challenge because we hit our biological peak man at like what is it like 23
[11316.24 --> 11323.20]  to 27 or something like that so everything's downhill every day my reflexes are slower
[11325.68 --> 11332.96]  oh hi there you know like every day i'm dumber every day my my peak physical condition
[11333.84 --> 11338.96]  erodes a little bit um so i never feel more energized than before
[11340.08 --> 11346.16]  however i wouldn't say that my workload as cvo is increased it's different um
[11347.60 --> 11355.36]  i was trying to cut back to four days a week for a long time i never actually really got that day off
[11355.36 --> 11359.68]  actually i shouldn't say never i think it happened somewhere between three and five times and then
[11359.68 --> 11366.32]  theoretically um i was gonna go to filming like three days a week starting at the beginning of this
[11366.32 --> 11373.12]  june but in practice um i've actually just started telling people i'm officially back to full time now
[11373.12 --> 11381.20]  because i mean the truth is we've been having some very challenging growth pains recently and um
[11381.20 --> 11388.08]  i don't mean this as a knock against anyone in particular uh what i mean is that it's just very
[11388.08 --> 11393.84]  difficult scaling a company from uh what's the german word again middle stat yeah something like that
[11393.84 --> 11401.68]  yeah uh the good one middle stand um very difficult scaling a company from middle stand to even just
[11401.68 --> 11408.64]  being a sustainable middle stand actually even if we weren't trying to 10x which i don't even think we are
[11408.64 --> 11417.84]  trying to do um i'd kind of rather not yeah people people people don't people don't want to stick
[11417.84 --> 11424.24]  around for stagnation right and staying middle stand forever might appeal to you or me or someone
[11424.24 --> 11428.96]  but it might not appeal to you know maybe dan maybe doesn't dan doesn't like that maybe that doesn't work
[11428.96 --> 11435.60]  for you know his career growth progression i'd still ride the bus but just like i applied some amount
[11435.60 --> 11440.72]  of resistance to us becoming the size we are now i would apply a similar amount of resistance to us
[11440.72 --> 11451.28]  10xing 500 would be difficult enough yeah thousand i would hope i was when i was talking 10x i was
[11451.28 --> 11455.36]  talking revenue i would hope we could 10x revenue without oh i thought you were talking headcount
[11455.36 --> 11459.84]  because we were talking about the difficulties oh god no i don't know oh yeah 10x probably be 200 i would
[11459.84 --> 11466.80]  say 200 220 you could probably do that level of revenue depends revenue yeah profit probably not
[11466.80 --> 11472.96]  let's go yeah 10x revenue we might be able to do like if we really scaled our activities in ltt store
[11473.60 --> 11479.76]  um and did like way more marketing so we just like go for maximum top line revenue knowing that the
[11479.76 --> 11485.20]  profitability is going to drop like a rock then yeah something like that could work uh jurasol says
[11485.20 --> 11490.48]  imagine building an air table for a thousand people yeah i read that and it gave me short-term
[11490.48 --> 11498.80]  trauma and i'm not even doing it it's going to be identical um there's there's like no change the
[11498.80 --> 11505.36]  the complexity is in how many types of jobs that's a big problem here as as much as it's a hundred jobs
[11505.36 --> 11511.28]  it's not a hundred people 200 people would still be about the same quantity unless we keep doing more
[11511.28 --> 11517.60]  and more things which is what this company does so yeah we already did the hard part linus coin
[11517.60 --> 11522.16]  we'll have a system integrator now we're gonna have now it's just scope creep and so we've already
[11522.16 --> 11527.84]  done the hard part so we're fine okay okay okay yeah because i was gonna say no now it's a thousand jobs
[11528.80 --> 11530.64]  um i might need another couple months
[11532.32 --> 11538.40]  uh vacation by the way this is the this is the best example i can do nice
[11538.40 --> 11544.16]  it's that all the zoom you got basically there we go yeah just like that it won't keep it perfect
[11544.64 --> 11552.00]  yeah that's what he's talking about yeah yeah there you go i can't i tried i tried every search term i
[11552.00 --> 11560.32]  could think of um and and couldn't find an actual example of it in a walkway like that i could find
[11560.32 --> 11565.04]  just the bars i found that and i've seen them everywhere they are oh does somebody have a link
[11569.04 --> 11573.76]  close that's close that's close not it's not perfect that's close yeah no the one luke showed
[11573.76 --> 11580.80]  is the one that we have all the all over the place here yeah the cyclist ender says curious bread yeah
[11580.80 --> 11586.80]  there's some rough videos there are actually have you seen them no yeah i don't need to see that yeah
[11586.80 --> 11595.68]  i mean you're not supposed to be riding your bike there it's just a slow down it's it means slow
[11595.68 --> 11601.28]  down a lot it means walk your bike the rough videos are usually from where it didn't have them and then
[11601.28 --> 11608.88]  they put them in because everybody rides looking at the ground well it's a lot of it's like coming
[11608.88 --> 11615.36]  down a hill or something that's bad should put a ramp and if it's like really gloomy out and raining
[11616.08 --> 11620.40]  and they're also gray and like the ones that i showed had like little stripes at the top most
[11620.40 --> 11624.32]  of them don't i have never seen them with any kind of indication that there is something that's gonna
[11624.32 --> 11628.72]  hurt you that was unique about this one usually they're just gray metal so like in certain conditions
[11628.72 --> 11632.72]  they're not the easiest thing to see and if you're traveling really fast you can whack them pretty
[11632.72 --> 11640.96]  hard i never have but i i know from video experience look up staggered barriers i did okay uh last one
[11640.96 --> 11646.16]  last one i got for you hey linus luke and dan wow somebody actually used normal words for a change
[11646.16 --> 11652.56]  still awake here in london enjoying the show i am brainstorming an app idea that i want to build
[11652.56 --> 11658.48]  and i was wondering back at the beginning of floatplane how did you plan it out that was my reaction when i
[11658.48 --> 11671.12]  read this too ah yes plan so jake and i had a semblance of a plan and then we talked about it
[11671.12 --> 11676.72]  somewhere concept of a plan they say yeah we had the idea of having a plan and we talked about it
[11676.72 --> 11684.56]  somewhere i don't remember where that was uh it was in a video or wanshow or something nice uh and then
[11684.56 --> 11692.40]  there was a thread made on the forum of people talking about it and aj who still works here thank
[11692.40 --> 11700.80]  goodness um responded being like uh neat plan uh but you could do it this way and it was like this
[11700.80 --> 11708.08]  really long write-up of like how we should actually do it and then we brought him on and did that nice
[11708.08 --> 11717.84]  nice nice and then we're like wow that was one of the worst times in history to make a video platform
[11718.96 --> 11724.96]  so a lot of it has changed since then but aj's plan for that time was good nice it's just with hindsight
[11724.96 --> 11734.08]  it's just like wow those weren't bad ideas but nice rough we'll see you again next week same bad time
[11734.96 --> 11737.04]  same bad channel
