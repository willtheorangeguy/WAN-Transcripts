[0.00 → 7.86] What's up everybody and welcome to the WAN show we've got a great show lined up for you guys
[7.86 → 15.84] Apple really wants you to see F1 the movie so much so that they would become
[15.84 → 24.44] everything they sought to destroy what was the title today I don't even oh yeah right
[24.44 → 32.84] right the whole um how is this, so controversy stop killing games controversial yeah you know
[32.84 → 38.04] how is this, so controversy stop killing games well we'll get to that but stop killing games
[38.04 → 48.56] is a thing maybe, or maybe it won't be, or maybe it is what an intro to a topic
[48.56 → 56.16] it's not an intro to a topic it's an intro to the show right we'd hate to misrepresent this and have
[56.16 → 62.34] people who are just tuning in for the first time think that this is a hinged show ah yes correct no
[62.34 → 69.94] hinges speaking of hinged Microsoft I'm removing this oh, oh from our laptop partner dell you can't
[69.94 → 70.78] it's too well-built
[70.78 → 73.78] my god
[73.78 → 82.48] ah, ah uh Microsoft has free option to Windows 10 to extend security updates program why does it say
[82.48 → 88.24] free it's definitely not free isn't if you're free what uh we'll talk about that later uh Cloudflare
[88.24 → 93.88] is changing the rules of the internet changing the rules for the better that's right are they changing
[93.88 → 95.36] rule 34 probably not
[95.36 → 122.48] the show is brought to you today by delete me zero bounce and AMD and of course our rap partner brand
[122.48 → 127.52] our chair partner secret lab and dell already got a shout-out they had enough they did
[127.52 → 133.18] leaning I was showing the logo stop killing games the wrong way so I was trying to do it right stop
[133.18 → 140.98] killing games did it but don't stop now unless what you want to stop is stop killing games you sound
[140.98 → 151.58] like a town crier I am the crier I was on two and a half men you know my name's John what it's the
[151.58 → 158.86] actor's name john cry oh wow all right stop killing games the initiative to save games from
[158.86 → 165.76] dying at the hands of their makers because usually developers stop making money on it, and they're like
[165.76 → 172.90] hmm see ya we architected this to only work if our servers are online, and now they're not so I guess um
[172.90 → 179.72] it's too bad see you later it has crossed the one million signatures it needed to get the attention
[179.72 → 185.32] of the EU commission which gives it a much higher chance to pass a law which could force developers
[185.32 → 193.24] to sunset their games properly now Luke and I have given our thoughts on what proper sun setting of
[193.24 → 199.58] games would look like and some perfect examples we've also given some examples of how
[199.58 → 206.48] in some cases it might not actually work that great it could be quite challenging whether it's
[206.48 → 213.14] around third-party licensing of say for example music or other media that's included in the game
[213.14 → 222.38] or whether it's around um IP that is used across multiple uh multiple products that could potentially
[222.38 → 228.44] harm the security of those other products or you know there are potential reasons that just you know
[228.44 → 233.52] putting out the source code of a particular game or putting the servers into the hands of the players
[233.52 → 240.80] might be really challenging, but that's what stop killing games is seeking to change is to make them
[240.80 → 248.04] architect these games from the ground up to comply with their obligation to make the game available
[248.04 → 256.14] after they no longer wish to support it whether that is in the hands of another entity or the gamers
[256.14 → 264.50] themselves anyway the petition is not over they want as many signatures as possible because the more
[264.50 → 270.36] signatures they get the better they can show interest in the movement, and it will also help in case some
[270.36 → 276.76] signatures are invalid for whatever reason given that this has gotten global attention I don't doubt that
[276.76 → 285.28] a significant portion of those 1 million signatures are probably not from the EU yeah there 's's a big push for
[285.28 → 291.22] for questioning not only may they not be from the EU, but there's some questioning of if it was like
[291.22 → 296.74] batted to go higher with the intention of hoping that people would slow down once it passed its mark
[296.74 → 305.84] so there 's's a lot of questions going on uh in other news because they have no sense of
[305.84 → 313.58] I don't know irony uh Ea has announced that anthems servers will be shutting down on January 12th
[313.58 → 323.02] 2026 and that the game will be removed from Ea play on August 15th 2025 um man there was some other
[323.02 → 328.04] terrible games industry news but I guess none of it had to do with games that were actually released
[328.04 → 334.02] you see Microsoft killed a bunch of jobs again no I didn't yeah include some games that
[334.02 → 340.16] apparently were so promising that like Microsoft executives had to have the controllers like
[340.16 → 345.78] taken out of their hands when they were play testing it like and now it's dead anyway so if
[345.78 → 351.86] you're from the EU head over to stopkillinggames.com and sing the petition because while this only
[351.86 → 357.88] affects the EU ruling it is quite possible nay probable that it will have a larger impact outside
[357.88 → 363.60] of the EU as well because if they already have to do all the work to architect their game so that
[363.60 → 370.38] it could be um tied up into a nice little bow and then hand it off once they no longer feel like
[370.38 → 377.22] supporting it then I pretty much guarantee you that that would have a positive impact for players in
[377.22 → 383.08] other countries as well other continents excuse me sorry, sorry EU is not a country um there's also a
[383.08 → 388.76] UK specific version of the petition on the same site if you scroll down a bit this has also reached
[388.76 → 396.48] the 100 000 signatures needed but couldn't always use more, so our discussion question here is can you
[396.48 → 403.28] brainstorm the ideal sun setting plan that developers could do to keep games alive forever is it leaving
[403.28 → 408.86] their servers up and running is it making it open source what's the ideal and I know my answer but i
[408.86 → 414.16] want to hear your answer yeah I don't think leaving their servers up forever is going to function to be it's
[414.16 → 420.16] it's not gonna no, no that's not going to work you can't, you can't just legislate companies losing money
[420.16 → 424.30] because eventually maintenance on things that are losing money yeah that's that's not gonna work
[424.30 → 429.90] yeah, but that doesn't mean that this is impossible or an unreasonable expectation for products that we
[429.90 → 436.78] buy right like these aren't products that are even sold to us necessarily as as a subscription
[436.78 → 443.06] service I mean they treat them like one, but these are products that in many cases we buy it's like a
[443.06 → 448.10] one-time transaction, and you can bury terms in your end user license agreement that make it so that
[448.10 → 454.82] you know you're only obligated to leave it up as long as you feel like it but I think there is a certain
[454.82 → 462.20] expectation that when I give you a one-time payment for something say one line thank you that that is now
[462.20 → 469.42] your line and that I don't have a remote line kill switch that will just take your line and get it
[469.42 → 476.96] out of here right like that is not what our expectation would be I think under normal circumstances
[476.96 → 482.68] I have pirated the lime nice open source line I like it
[482.68 → 493.26] I'll just put that back you whacked the TV well it still looks like it'll never prove it
[493.26 → 496.88] you'll never prove it the camera didn't see anything
[496.88 → 502.72] um yeah I don't know it's its a little tough for some games um
[502.72 → 510.14] I don't necessarily think it's completely unsolvable because the stance that we've had
[510.14 → 514.48] I don't know if this perfect honestly I'm not super on top of the stop killing game stuff so I don't
[514.48 → 519.12] know if this perfectly aligns with theirs but the stance that we've had is that you should at least
[519.12 → 525.60] give the community a chance to do it yeah I'd say my ideal execution of this is forged alliance
[525.60 → 533.28] forever yeah supreme commander was a super cool game that I really enjoyed um I think I forget i
[533.28 → 540.44] forget who went down first gas powered games or the uh but ultimately what happened is there was some
[540.44 → 548.38] complexity around any kind of transfer of the IP um there was some drama that went down around I think
[548.38 → 553.40] it was it gas powered games that went down first you know what I really don't remember so
[553.40 → 559.62] it doesn't matter the point is either the publisher or the developer went bye-bye and what they ultimately
[559.62 → 567.92] arrived on was leaving the matchmaking and custom map hosting and community chat and all of these
[567.92 → 574.30] features leaving them in the hands of the community that wanted to maintain the game and be stewards of
[574.30 → 581.68] the game meaning that even though it has been like 10 plus years now since that game was no longer
[581.68 → 588.52] actively supported by the developer you can still play it online you can play custom maps there's all
[588.52 → 593.20] kinds of cool mods that you can apply so they have their own like mod workshop that's built within
[593.20 → 599.76] the fa forever so forged alliance was the uh the expansion to supreme commander so it's forged
[599.76 → 605.32] alliance forever so within the forged alliance forever launcher um it handles automatic updates
[605.32 → 613.38] it's a little Jacky sure but in a way that's honestly like I'm completely fine it's kind of cool
[613.38 → 622.08] it reminds me of old style computing, but it's alive it's freaking alive and the best part is the IP
[622.08 → 628.86] holders still get to profit from it so you have to buy they've worked out a system where you have to
[628.86 → 635.00] authenticate with the uh with the forged alliance forever server that you have to give it access to
[635.00 → 640.66] your steam library and prove that you own a copy of supreme commander or forged alliance also
[640.66 → 646.50] think is fine which I think is totally fine I mean if is the company is willing to hand all these reins
[646.50 → 652.20] over in the way that they did then I think it's its okay ideally they put it at a price that's like
[652.20 → 658.48] not yeah, and it's I think it's pretty reasonable these days but the point is just that this is a way
[658.48 → 664.76] that the players continue to win by being allowed to play the game and the publisher and or developer
[664.76 → 670.56] depending on whatever their revenue split looks like gets to continue to win by occasionally selling
[670.56 → 677.34] the game here and there that's freaking awesome you can buy it for two dollars and 79 cents right now
[677.34 → 683.86] that is two us dollars it's its a great game it actually has legitimately really fun a pretty decent
[683.86 → 688.90] campaign like it's a RTS campaign so you know how it goes you do each level, and you unlock some
[688.90 → 694.66] more of the tech tree, and you kill all the bad guys or whatever um and I would say that the online
[694.66 → 699.90] can be a little daunting to get into because you'll finish that campaign and think you're a supreme
[699.90 → 707.50] commander god, and then you'll jump in online and get absolutely curb stomped it's the kid the skill
[707.50 → 713.72] ramp is insane, but it has a really great built-in replay function um that allows you to watch back
[713.72 → 719.22] at any speed you want and like it's really quick to go through replays uh people from my experience
[719.22 → 724.64] have been very friendly and willing to discuss strategy so once you get a handle on some of the
[724.64 → 731.30] starts it's 2d seems great if it's uh it's its pretty fun if you like a deep if you like a deep
[731.30 → 739.88] RTS, and it has the best top-down interface that has ever existed for a game
[739.88 → 747.24] I will stand behind that the strategic zoom is outstanding it's very easy to get around the map
[747.24 → 753.32] with a mouse wheel you basically you don't you don't move the cursor to the edge of the screen
[753.32 → 760.52] and pan that's like dinosaur technology so you just use the mouse wheel and kind of like zooming in
[760.52 → 766.10] on an image in like an image editor you just kind of like zoom out and then zoom in its like
[766.10 → 774.36] and then you can actually turn so you can turn your viewport into like a super zoomed in look at what
[774.36 → 779.46] something is doing you can like you could go to one of your factories and see the unit that's being
[779.46 → 785.38] like 3d printed on the bed, and then you can zoom all the way out, so your whole monitor is just a big
[785.38 → 793.48] mini map like a you know a not mini map, but you know anyway the point is there are icons for
[793.48 → 799.10] little just little icons representing all the units, and you can see like a whole strategic view of the
[799.10 → 804.04] entire battlefield it even supports multi-monitor it did back in the day anyway so you could have
[804.04 → 809.54] like your giant mini map on one monitor and then your gameplay view on uh on another monitor it
[809.54 → 816.46] was like freaking awesome maxi map says when bingo chronicled yeah exactly, exactly apparently
[816.46 → 821.80] factor has something similar as well strategic zoom dude huge innovation in that game absolutely
[821.80 → 828.46] love it so that's my that's kind of the ideal to me is like put put put the ability to keep running
[828.46 → 833.98] it in the hands of the community and if the community doesn't care then that's fine all right
[833.98 → 841.40] all right and some games will still die I would prefer the things required to be put somewhere
[841.40 → 848.92] some external repository that doesn't cost to maintain like a public GitHub or something like
[848.92 → 855.20] that I don't know but like put it somewhere um I don't know if this makes any sense internet archive
[855.20 → 859.82] its something do something so that you never have to look at it again because honestly if the company
[859.82 → 864.92] doesn't ever want to look at it again I think that's completely fine um also don't take it back
[864.92 → 872.12] if you have given it up to the community, and then they find some huge success with if it's theirs yeah
[872.12 → 878.54] but there's an opportunity there as well because that keeps the IP alive it keeps it learn what they
[878.54 → 886.88] did that worked really well yeah and then do a sequel it's still you rip yeah yeah um i what other parts
[886.88 → 892.50] of it i I know like an argument that I've heard is like oh what about the music licensing it's like
[892.50 → 899.54] okay yeah that's that can be a thing take the music out I mean I think at that point you could even
[899.54 → 904.00] potentially task the community with doing that you could be like here's all the stuff that's not
[904.00 → 912.24] licensed like we realistically you know we're we're insolvent now you know like we're not we don't
[912.24 → 918.00] have the don't have the means to do anything with this anymore, but yeah here's the documentation
[918.00 → 923.58] you guys are responsible for your own legal minefield you have to remove any licensed music
[923.58 → 927.98] and replace it with something else to me, I'm okay with I don't know how that necessarily works legally
[927.98 → 933.38] but it seems fine to me, I don't think you can legislate companies working on something in perpetuity
[933.38 → 941.94] yeah you can't do that yeah but what you can do is you can create an expectation that they will
[941.94 → 947.42] hand over in some semblance of working order the materials that are needed to continue the work
[947.42 → 950.82] if there is someone who is willing to take it on
[950.82 → 957.08] I don't think they can even hand over the music it needs to be removed beforehand that's easy to do
[957.08 → 963.04] and besides I don't think i I don't even know I don't even know if i I don't even know if I would
[963.04 → 970.96] buy that because realistically the the the ownership the right to use music comes down to licensing
[970.96 → 977.62] anyway like I could hand you a CD and that wouldn't be a license to include it in a game
[977.62 → 984.86] so like if is I handed you a file pack I am not handing you a license to use it in a game I'm just
[984.86 → 991.28] like it's its one zero distributing the music you are
[991.28 → 998.20] but you're not legal people we're not going to figure this out yeah no but you're distributing
[998.20 → 1004.88] it with a set of terms that prohibit actually using it for anything yeah like i I don't know
[1004.88 → 1009.80] that's that's that's a tough question that's for the legal people to figure out and i you know
[1009.80 → 1016.16] appreciate their hard work but i my point doesn't change that I don't think this is insurmountable
[1016.16 → 1022.28] um our other question is I know you guys are boomers and play old games but are there any
[1022.28 → 1026.28] games that have been shut down that have impacted your social circle I already know Luke's answer
[1026.28 → 1033.60] oh i you probably do yeah just when wow went to yeah like that's a that's an even more interesting
[1033.60 → 1039.00] question because that's a version of a game that is still running yeah that's a that's a tougher one
[1039.00 → 1045.24] that gets really tough um I don't think there's any recourse there the community forced that too
[1045.24 → 1051.86] you mean bringing back wow classic yeah but then didn't wow classic like evolve and then is like
[1051.86 → 1056.94] not wow classic any more yeah no so no what I mean is like nostalgics back in the day and
[1056.94 → 1062.28] nostalgics is the most well-known one, but there's a ton of private servers for wow sure not just
[1062.28 → 1067.72] nostalgics and there still are private servers for wow ton many of them um the community forced that
[1067.72 → 1072.28] they like rebuilt boss mechanics and stuff that they didn't have because they had to build like
[1072.28 → 1079.54] the server side of it, and it's honestly extremely impressive um that was just out of like an immense
[1079.54 → 1087.00] amount of community um attention I guess, but there is yeah there's still the original classic wow branch
[1087.00 → 1093.10] that blizzard made, but it's still going, and it's way past classic wow now and then there's like some
[1093.10 → 1097.58] other versions I don't know all of them there's a hardcore one where if you die your characters
[1097.58 → 1102.56] done and there's one I think called season of mastery where they like to change a bunch of stuff
[1102.56 → 1107.62] I don't I don't know if many people are into that and then there are rumors of them making what they're
[1107.62 → 1114.38] calling classic plus now which is a whole other thing um but yeah like games that iterate ever quest
[1114.38 → 1121.78] wow all these old MMOs like it's fascinating because where does that argument stop because it
[1121.78 → 1127.16] might not even be within an expansion might be a patch within an expansion yeah so like a state of a
[1127.16 → 1133.78] game yeah like I mean okay here's a here's a perfect example of a game that you know there
[1133.78 → 1138.98] wouldn't be any kind of stop killing games impact on, but they've absolutely made a change to it that
[1138.98 → 1145.24] has killed our ability to enjoy it uh tape to tape that's an early access game I have good news for
[1145.24 → 1152.86] you are okay that's an early access game right now that they moved away from time-based um game lengths
[1152.86 → 1161.86] to just first to reach a certain number of goals it's a hockey game um and Luke was so upset by this
[1161.86 → 1168.56] change to the gameplay that I actually reached out to the lead developer um or lead designer I guess
[1168.56 → 1175.56] is technically his title and i I advocated on your behalf and mine as well I agree that a hockey game
[1175.56 → 1182.02] is determined by the clock not by how many you know who reaches the threshold number of goals is three
[1182.02 → 1190.86] periods three periods and um there is now a drop-down which totally cool the pre-alpha branch so you
[1190.86 → 1196.02] can select your difficulty, and you can select first to a certain number of goals or time-based which is
[1196.02 → 1201.86] because maybe some people will like that very weird version of first to three goals maybe some
[1201.86 → 1207.54] people are into that cool I don't if it's an option I'm totally down yeah so it's we're back
[1207.54 → 1214.10] baby I looked today, and it's in nice it's in the pre-alpha branch so cool that's good yeah very cool
[1214.10 → 1219.20] very cool um but yeah it gets you know but yeah stop killing games wouldn't do anything about that
[1219.20 → 1225.44] because like everyone is mad about classic wow, but it's still technically I don't know what expansion
[1225.44 → 1230.02] they're even on now but like the main branch is still technically there it never technically went away
[1230.02 → 1235.48] yep the game was technically never killed it was never killed it was just expanded upon for decades
[1235.48 → 1241.08] so this is a is a tough this is going to be a tough thing to tackle because there's absolutely
[1241.08 → 1247.10] practical challenges like we've outlined already not being able to legislate maintaining software
[1247.10 → 1254.98] forever not being able to legislate never patching in or out functionality like that's something that
[1254.98 → 1260.40] they could do to get around this pretty easily is they could just patch out multiplayer yeah
[1260.40 → 1268.56] okay well that we didn't kill the game we patched the game down to a like you open a door and then
[1268.56 → 1273.68] the game is over it's its it's now long it's no longer multiplayer it is single player and it
[1273.68 → 1279.62] shows the game uh you open one door and then the game ends, and it says congratulations your speed run
[1279.62 → 1284.18] time is you know x or whatever, and we have given the files out to the community to run this game
[1284.18 → 1290.64] so there 's's absolutely ways around this that we'd have to kind of try to brainstorm all the
[1290.64 → 1297.18] sneaky ideas that executives and publishers might have to get around it, but it's a tough problem I'm happy
[1297.18 → 1304.16] someone's trying to address it yes at least this is a step and I'm really glad to see that it's got the
[1304.16 → 1311.00] momentum that it does even if there are some voices within formerly of the industry that are speaking
[1311.00 → 1317.06] out against it because of some of these practical challenges around crafting this legislation and
[1317.06 → 1325.02] then ultimately enforcing it what do you want to talk about next oh well what's our headline not
[1325.02 → 1331.02] really our headline topic but what our main topic apple really wants you to see the f1 wants you to see
[1331.02 → 1341.54] f1 the movie yeah in an excellent piece published on the star.com dot my sure dot com dot my
[1341.54 → 1348.94] yeah okay don't worry about it uh Jason attend attend attend sure Jason yeah uh discusses what he thinks is
[1348.94 → 1354.92] apple's most important product trust and how apple violated customers trust with the recent push
[1354.92 → 1360.96] notifications sent to U.S. iPhone users through the wallet app offering them a ten dollar discount on
[1360.96 → 1369.82] tickets for the uh for f1 the movie huh I mean I have talked about this a fair bit but it always
[1369.82 → 1378.66] rings quite hypocritical to me, I don't like that when apple criticizes their competitors for being ad
[1378.66 → 1386.96] platforms when apple is taking their very operating system and behaving no different from when Microsoft
[1386.96 → 1395.70] integrated one drive that bothers you to subscribe to it or put stupid Candy Crush in the stupid start menu
[1395.70 → 1405.34] this is what apple would criticize anyone else for doing on any other timeline
[1405.34 → 1413.24] so attend opines that apple's entire brand is that it is not like other tech companies
[1413.24 → 1418.42] yes their products are expensive but in exchange for the larger bill at the checkout you get a better
[1418.42 → 1424.02] user experience in an ecosystem that at least claims to prioritize privacy and security over mining and
[1424.02 → 1431.06] monetizing your data he says that when apple uses an app most associated with security and trust to
[1431.06 → 1439.42] advertise to its users it crosses a line absolutely tech crunch reported on widespread social media
[1439.42 → 1445.80] complaints about the promotion and noted that a new offers and promotion setting for iOS 26's wallet
[1445.80 → 1452.04] app suggests that apple plans to push more marketing through the app in the future the push notification
[1452.04 → 1460.10] this is funny is actually in violation of apple's own app store guidelines' guideline 4.5.4 states that
[1460.10 → 1466.56] push notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have
[1466.56 → 1472.74] explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your apps UI, and you provide a method in your app for
[1472.74 → 1481.64] a user to opt out of receiving such messages so Jason goes on to say a company that has spent years telling the world that
[1481.64 → 1488.74] privacy is a fundamental human right a company that famously took on Facebook and limited how apps can track users across other apps and
[1488.74 → 1496.46] websites just used its own system level app to send out marketing content that users didn't ask for
[1496.46 → 1501.98] and couldn't opt out of that's not a great look how much money did they get for this
[1501.98 → 1507.42] uh well I don't think it's so much about how much money they got I think it's more about how much money they spent
[1507.42 → 1519.48] like this is an Apple TV production oh yeah I see our discussion question is but at least that u2 album was awesome
[1519.48 → 1528.52] right says Jordan uh, so this is actually not the first time that apple has just brazenly used their platform for marketing
[1528.52 → 1536.10] what is this website sorry Apple TV is buying the TV rights in the U.S. for f1 sorry, sorry that's the affiliation
[1536.10 → 1540.12] thank you uh Brad uh
[1540.12 → 1550.78] what is it this is the star.com.my website is a mess yeah don't worry about if it's a good it's a good
[1550.78 → 1557.62] take either way okay yeah let's not worry too much about that for now all right so I guess the question
[1557.62 → 1566.76] here is are we really surprised I mean apple's hypocrisy has been on full display for so long and I know that
[1566.76 → 1572.70] this really rubs a lot of apple fans the wrong way whenever I point it out but like
[1572.70 → 1579.44] apple's whole thing with their whole like sub site on apple.com about all their sustainability
[1579.44 → 1587.56] while at the same time in their other hand they're either facilitating or explicitly enforcing the
[1587.56 → 1595.52] bricking of perfectly functional devices like apple's whole holier than now thing around user privacy and
[1595.52 → 1600.28] security while operating data centres that are effectively under the control of the Chinese
[1600.28 → 1609.12] government for their Chinese users like can we please stop pretending that apple is anything
[1609.12 → 1618.32] other than an equally soulless and heartless corporation like any other please don't fall for
[1618.32 → 1624.24] the branding that's all I ask and when yeah and when apple rubs me the wrong way over this stuff
[1624.24 → 1630.00] a big part of it is honestly not that they're behaving any different this is honestly not
[1630.00 → 1635.06] any worse than you know Samsung promoting their crap to me on my Samsung phone or google promoting
[1635.06 → 1641.86] their crap to me on my Google phone the difference is that those guys for the most part just kind of own
[1641.86 → 1651.00] it googles like yep we're an advertising company whereas apple sits there and just blows smoke up their
[1651.00 → 1658.80] own asshole about how amazing they are and how much they care about this stuff no you don't when the
[1658.80 → 1667.02] rubber hits the road you guys will sell us out as fast as anyone else and here's the proof in f1 okay
[1667.02 → 1672.08] rubber hits the road didn't quite work there but the f1 thing you know what I'm standing by it
[1672.76 → 1678.68] rubber one of my problems that I'm having is like people in some people in flow plane shad and some places
[1678.68 → 1683.52] that I'm others I'm seeing elsewhere I think this directly ties into what you were kind of just
[1683.52 → 1691.10] talking about but um people are like oh, but it's good though it's like man you can't that doesn't
[1691.10 → 1694.44] work because what if the next one's not good well yeah
[1694.44 → 1700.94] Kai says except for Linus media group incorporated they have a soul right
[1700.94 → 1706.62] no I'd like to think that some of the people who work here have a soul but the company itself
[1706.62 → 1713.86] I'd like to think that influential people who work here have a soul and care but as soon as you go
[1713.86 → 1720.42] public you are beholden to your shareholders and in that case your shareholders are in it for
[1720.42 → 1728.48] literally one thing like in our case our primary shareholder that's me has to get out here every week
[1728.48 → 1736.72] and talk to you guys directly and you guys talk to me directly sometimes very direct minus we need to
[1736.72 → 1744.08] talk okay yeah that video you did on the lawnmower today didn't enjoy it actually for uh for
[1744.08 → 1747.78] just like a Friday showcase people seem to be kind of into the lawnmower video today they said it's a
[1747.78 → 1754.78] lot better than the pool robot when we did so we we we want land robot not water robot the point is
[1754.78 → 1760.52] the point I'm making is that we have a two-way dialogue and there is an actual ability potentially
[1760.52 → 1764.72] at least to make your voice heard and that may actually affect change, and we did take a lot of
[1764.72 → 1770.26] the feedback from that pool robot video and integrate it into making a better lawn robot video this time
[1770.26 → 1776.92] was it still just a sponsored showcase that we put in our Friday time slot where it's ultimately going
[1776.92 → 1782.26] to get stomped on by wan show, and we know it's not going to perform very well you better believe it
[1782.26 → 1789.06] but hey we're able to have this conversation, and we're able to make it as best of that as it could
[1789.06 → 1794.44] possibly be whereas with a publicly traded company like at the end of the day the people with the
[1794.44 → 1800.18] influential voice are going to be the shareholders that are able to exert power over the board of
[1800.18 → 1808.48] directors and the executive team um that's it your voice doesn't actually matter and if apple sees
[1808.48 → 1813.92] that in spite of people being upset about this that a bunch more people go to see f1 the movie
[1813.92 → 1817.76] and they ultimately get a bunch of kickbacks from it, they're just going to do it again
[1817.76 → 1828.16] so no we don't have a soul and no you shouldn't just implicitly you know believe that we have your
[1828.16 → 1834.00] the best interest at heart at the end of the day we are a corporation like any other but I also think
[1834.00 → 1840.00] that being a smaller company not a publicly traded company not having investors who are purely in it
[1840.00 → 1847.68] to extract as much value as possible over as fast a timeline as possible I do think that that makes
[1847.68 → 1858.80] smaller companies a little different maybe we even think different maybe we are apple okay i genuinely
[1858.80 → 1864.32] really miss the old taglines like intel inside was perfect what even is intel's current one
[1865.36 → 1871.36] is it still intel inside I don't think I legitimately don't even know but like this is a pro I can think
[1871.36 → 1879.36] of uh there's one company that I really like their tagline, and then they changed it and I like kept
[1879.36 → 1885.44] saying their old one and then they square space mad at us build it beautiful it was so much better
[1885.44 → 1890.96] what is it now I don't know yeah who cares once you get one that's perfect and everyone likes
[1890.96 → 1896.00] you should probably just keep it is this just nostalgia glasses though do you are you just a
[1896.00 → 1901.28] boomer who remember beautiful was good who remembers things the way they liked it intel inside was good
[1902.56 → 1910.56] think different was good what is apples now what's ours I don't think we have one maybe we should
[1910.56 → 1915.76] ignite a passion for technology okay that's on our mission statement that's not it though yeah that's
[1915.76 → 1928.24] not it lights things on fire dude when I did that interview and talked about sort of how we see our
[1928.24 → 1934.16] role in the tech space as like going around and like starting little fires and like seeing what burns you
[1934.16 → 1941.84] know what I was thinking was ignite passion for technology but the context around the events that
[1941.84 → 1949.12] happened at that time with the California wildfires and the fact that I was down in California oh no
[1949.12 → 1954.72] and the timing of the release of the video like the wildfires hadn't happened yet when I used that
[1954.72 → 1958.56] analogy yeah
[1958.56 → 1965.52] yeah so maybe we're sometimes doing stuff in public is hard yeah how about we sprout passion for
[1965.52 → 1974.96] technology we'll change it sure sprout it is sounds impregnate it oh impregnate passion yeah that
[1976.64 → 1985.28] plant seeds of passion yeah deep seeds like from alien burst out of your chest
[1985.28 → 1989.68] um cool
[1993.20 → 1999.44] uh what are we are something that speaking of fires is something on fire uh somewhat I got it though it's
[1999.44 → 2003.36] fine he's doing great uh why don't we jump into whatever we're supposed to be doing next we could
[2003.36 → 2008.00] do another topic, or we could do some merch messages how about some merch messages if uh Luke's doing his
[2008.00 → 2017.36] job instead of his job whoa oh interesting okay sure uh, uh merch messages are the way to interact with
[2017.36 → 2024.64] the show we've actually got where'd it go there it is huh we've got a really exciting new product on the
[2024.64 → 2031.20] store right now it is our transparent edition of the LTT screwdriver it's every bit the LTT screwdriver
[2031.20 → 2037.28] that you already know and love, but now it's clear so you can see the bits like this, and you can even
[2037.28 → 2042.08] see them when they're in their like that you can even see the ratchet mechanism moving around in there
[2042.08 → 2047.12] a little bit as it click click click click click and makes it satisfying noises so now
[2047.12 → 2054.08] is a perfect time just like Jacob s to pick up one of these by sending in a merch message merch messages go to
[2054.08 → 2059.68] producer Dan who will either reply to them himself forward them internally for someone else to address
[2059.68 → 2066.88] or curate them for me and Luke all you got to do to send a merch message is go to lttstore.com
[2068.08 → 2076.24] add something to your cart like hey say for example this or the transparent collection that's a cool hoodie
[2076.24 → 2083.28] that actually has my dental records on it because we are absolutely unhinged people uh what else we got
[2083.28 → 2089.68] you could add ooh the new uh hydrophase swim shorts from our touch sand collection just add something
[2089.68 → 2093.84] to your cart and whenever we're live you will see a box for a merch message Dan you want to show the
[2093.84 → 2100.96] peoples how it works sure thing I've got one here from Alissa Linus I have an Epsom home cinema 4010 pro
[2100.96 → 2108.48] UHD saw the valerian pro 2 video specs beat mine on paper I thought that short throws were worse than
[2108.48 → 2114.88] traditional projectors what am I missing is it worth switching for so I'd say traditional viewpoint
[2114.88 → 2121.84] is that short throws were worse because you could have more distortion um because of the optics
[2121.84 → 2127.68] that are needed to create such a large image over such a short distance and how much you have to kind
[2127.68 → 2133.92] of stretch it in order to do that and just the angle of the light in the wall and all that um with that said
[2133.92 → 2143.60] optics is an area of technological advancement over the last like 10 to 20 years that honestly
[2143.60 → 2149.44] probably has not gotten enough attention it's one of those things where like people often in person
[2149.44 → 2154.80] people thinking they're going to get an unexpected answer will ask me things like you know what's the
[2154.80 → 2160.64] most exciting change in technology you've seen over your career and the answer that I invariably give
[2160.64 → 2167.04] because I genuinely believe this uh is one that they don't expect, so nobody comes away disappointed
[2167.04 → 2176.24] but I think it's actually in lighting um think about what has transpired in the time our company has
[2176.24 → 2185.44] existed in lighting like cinema lighting technology but also just the expense even the kino float like what
[2185.44 → 2194.00] has scaled simultaneously in quality like lighting and in cost like lighting in the time that our
[2194.00 → 2199.84] company has existed name something that is not what I would have expected our kino flow diva lights
[2199.84 → 2208.08] were these quad fluorescent tube light things that had this cheap shoddy like corrugated plastic
[2208.72 → 2215.36] flap system on them, they were freaking heavy they were ridiculously expensive very expensive
[2215.36 → 2223.68] they like sucked uh they weren't very bright, and they had absolutely no capacity for adjusting them
[2224.00 → 2229.04] uh in terms of their um their colour temperature they just like were what they were whatever
[2229.04 → 2237.68] fluorescent tubes you put in them nowadays dude companies like aperture you for like a few hundred bucks
[2237.68 → 2244.00] you can get lights that are ludicrously bright like you can run your entire set off a single circuit
[2244.00 → 2249.92] instead of having to you know have flipping like one halogen light that has to run off a cable from way
[2249.92 → 2254.64] the Frick that set over there and then like a bunch of other ones for the back that can run on this
[2254.64 → 2260.24] circuit you need like three circuits to light your stupid set you can run an entire set-off of a single
[2260.24 → 2266.00] circuit you can make all these fancy adjustments to your colour temperature and your brightness it's super
[2266.00 → 2272.88] granular it's all like wirelessly controlled and relatively simple to integrate compared to what things were like
[2272.88 → 2280.96] back when we started um man what we paid for our uh flipping uh well the RGB lights Dan that our first
[2280.96 → 2286.72] ones the blue ones sky panels or the titan tubes or something like that oh dude titan tubes are so
[2286.72 → 2293.28] expensive dude, but now you can now you can get like off-brand ones that are like way cheaper they're like
[2293.28 → 2297.84] battery powered you could stick a light anywhere you want and just as powerful, and they're, and they're
[2297.84 → 2303.20] awesome but like our first sky panels those are from ARI which tells you everything you need to
[2303.20 → 2308.24] know about how much they cost and like I was like oh this is so cool because they had modes for uh like
[2308.24 → 2314.48] firelight flickering and modes for like old school black and white TV so you could have it like off camera
[2314.48 → 2319.28] and it could like to cast kind of like sometimes a little bit more black sometimes a bit more white I think
[2319.28 → 2324.48] some just a cop car they had cop car I think some people aren't recognizing that you are talking
[2324.48 → 2331.68] chronologically yeah because I got a comment that are like oh this thing is much better than the kino flow
[2332.56 → 2338.56] the kino flow that we bought was 15 years ago yeah yeah that's the point yeah is the kino flow sucked
[2339.12 → 2345.84] back then, but that was like the go-to like decent kind of affordable light it was like five grand or
[2345.84 → 2350.40] something like that almost every YouTuber that was heavily investing in their camera setups at that
[2350.40 → 2358.80] time that I knew um had kino flows yeah and like dude by comparison I could buy some stupid little like
[2358.80 → 2364.00] led array on AliExpress and a little bit of like diffusion paper or something and I could get better
[2364.00 → 2370.48] lighting results out of that for like 20 bucks than that kino flow from it's been pretty like 13 years
[2370.48 → 2374.56] ago or whenever we bought it even the lights that are behind you now those tiny little square things
[2374.56 → 2383.84] they're so bright they're ip65 waterproof they're led um they're RGB they're taped to the floor yes
[2383.84 → 2388.32] you can't move them because people bump into them dude and the little battery powered ones you can put
[2388.32 → 2393.36] on your camera like those existed 10 years ago they were kind of rough, but they were pretty bad they
[2393.36 → 2399.12] weren't bright they were expensive the battery life sucked like I remember we'd have to oh man we'd like
[2399.12 → 2404.24] micromanage like our mic pack batteries and our camera batteries and a stupid battery for the
[2404.24 → 2410.56] little thing uh nowadays it's so easy to build a nice rig with just like one battery that like daisy
[2410.56 → 2418.08] chains across to everything um no, no I dude oh man smash champs is another great example of
[2418.08 → 2428.00] this um hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna just bring this up do you have any flipping idea what the lighting
[2428.00 → 2433.76] here would have cost me just like 15 years ago I think one of the reasons why this is probably so
[2433.76 → 2440.00] surprising for people is because house lighting premium house lighting is still really expensive
[2440.56 → 2448.00] and honestly I don't know why house lighting for LEDs looks kind of poo uh hold on where's that where's a
[2448.00 → 2454.32] better shot that shows okay so here oh no is that a video why do I keep clicking videos can I just click
[2454.32 → 2460.00] something that's not a video here we go is this a video there it's not a video okay perfect okay
[2460.00 → 2468.80] they're not actually on this is absolutely genius here we go finally okay, okay cool so um this lighting
[2468.80 → 2476.56] setup here was inspired by a lighting setup that I saw in a hall in Taiwan like almost 10 years ago now
[2476.56 → 2484.24] I think, and they had these really cool fixtures they were basically giant rectangular prisms that had
[2484.24 → 2492.08] that were like a like diffuse uh like matte white prisms that were suspended across the entire hall
[2492.08 → 2499.36] kind of like this um, and it was less Jacky because they didn't have all these stupid like ready rods and
[2499.36 → 2504.80] aircraft cable and stuff like they were really nice architectural design as opposed to our functional
[2504.80 → 2513.60] design and um ever since I played there i I knew I wanted that for my ideal lighting because it brings the
[2513.60 → 2519.12] lights down closer to the court and the closer the light is the less bright it needs to be and
[2519.12 → 2524.00] therefore the less dazzling it is whenever you accidentally look directly into the light which
[2524.00 → 2528.88] inevitably will happen when there's a moving projectile that could be coming from anywhere to
[2528.88 → 2536.88] anywhere on the court surface um to do something like that back in the day good lord they were so bright
[2536.88 → 2543.36] crazy yeah you would, it would have had to have been full of either incandescent or CCF light sources
[2543.36 → 2548.80] you'd be losing a bunch of it to the diffusion layer nowadays do you know how we made
[2548.80 → 2555.68] these are just like your typical four by two office light panels, and then they're just on an
[2555.68 → 2563.28] angle yeah they're just mounted to like this uh this aluminum structure here is there a diffusion
[2563.28 → 2568.72] layer on there in addition to the standard no that's just built in yeah because it looks good it's
[2568.72 → 2572.40] just built in it looks like way better they've got little colour temperature switches on them
[2573.04 → 2576.88] so you can just decide what colour temperature you want and look at this you can actually really
[2576.88 → 2584.40] tell in the picture that the consistency is perfect oh yeah like even it feels like that when
[2584.40 → 2590.64] you're there too even when led panels got somewhat affordable like I don't know what five years ago
[2590.64 → 2597.04] 10 years ago the cry of them sucked, and the consistency was all over the place nowadays you
[2597.04 → 2603.68] can just buy commodity stuff like these weren't even expensive I mean buy enough of them and anything's
[2603.68 → 2611.36] expensive but relatively speaking they weren't even expensive, and they're just outstanding and so i yeah
[2611.36 → 2618.40] i just I can't think of anything in the technology space that has come down in price and up in quality
[2618.40 → 2623.84] like led lighting and i have to i have to caveat this with I'm going to say health things, and you're watching
[2623.84 → 2631.60] a tech podcast so don't uh don't yell at me just look it up a lime a day keeps your lover away
[2633.20 → 2639.52] um I was trying to pick something I like that one uh but yeah I've heard meanwhile in homes I've heard
[2639.52 → 2644.72] that things like the very, very white light that we're getting from modern LEDs and stuff is like
[2644.72 → 2649.36] bad for you because of circadian rhythm things and stuff like that oh like the colour temperature
[2649.36 → 2654.80] that we yeah that we set everything to cry I think something they're not very full spectrum no I'm not
[2654.80 → 2660.64] I'm not very up on top of this but then like actually nice lighting for your home is really
[2660.64 → 2666.48] expensive still so it hasn't the like consumer space hasn't really followed the exact same trend in
[2666.48 → 2672.00] my experience oh as like the production space and the commercial space yeah well maybe it's just different
[2672.00 → 2678.00] different incentives right like on the production space in the production space everything comes down
[2678.00 → 2685.44] to like yeah why yeah I mean I guess just my understanding is like led technology just misses
[2685.44 → 2690.00] a bunch of wavelengths, and then you get something like the china ball that's above us
[2690.00 → 2695.28] which is a know full spectrum proper real light uh-huh they have to do a lot of work
[2695.28 → 2702.56] right interesting that's my understanding please feel free to correct me, but you know a high cry and
[2702.56 → 2708.72] full spectrum bulbs are way easier to do in the day and I guess what's driving what's driving
[2708.72 → 2713.92] the innovation there that allows them to do that in the production space is a combination like you've got
[2713.92 → 2723.04] the volume to invest in building a perfect LED light and which obviously you would have in like a
[2723.04 → 2728.32] home setting as well you have the volume but in a production space you also have people willing to
[2728.32 → 2733.60] pay at least some premium whereas I don't know about you but for me when I'm like buying a light bulb to
[2733.60 → 2742.72] put in a fixture in my house I'm not I'm not paying like extra yeah, and it's, and it's cheaper because you
[2742.72 → 2745.36] don't have to care yeah we really have to care
[2745.36 → 2753.20] that's interesting yeah and the flicker free stuff like your led scan blink in your home
[2753.20 → 2758.32] that's apparently a huge problem you can't perceptively tell that they're blinking, but it's like bad for
[2758.32 → 2765.04] you for some is reason again like please yeah who knows I did make sure I did make sure these don't
[2765.04 → 2768.96] flicker where's my do you want to press the thing oh uh yeah i could do that
[2768.96 → 2775.92] do do do it there you go there we go I don't know look it up if you care but uh there's
[2775.92 → 2779.44] there's a lot of stuff going on with lighting yeah I made sure these don't flicker because
[2779.44 → 2785.12] we want to be able to record in slo-mo at some point and I didn't want that to be a problem so
[2785.12 → 2792.24] and it was not that hard to find just commodity office lights that just to go in a drop ceiling that
[2792.24 → 2797.28] don't flicker it was just it blew my mind that never used to be a thing yeah I know right like
[2797.28 → 2805.84] impossible I know right yeah, so the quality just keeps getting it gets, and it's happening so fast
[2805.84 → 2810.96] like even five years ago when we were looking for lights like for the office it was freaking
[2810.96 → 2816.32] impossible to find anything that like Brandon wouldn't lose his if we installed and like
[2816.32 → 2821.28] didn't have also proper filming lights in addition to them whereas like nowadays we could just Huck these
[2821.28 → 2826.72] in the office and turn on a camera like incredible pretty I think the ones we put in the labs like
[2826.72 → 2833.52] the drop-in ceiling ones pretty high cry yep pretty decent super dimmable yeah, yeah top gear and full
[2833.52 → 2839.12] planchette is calling it PWM flicker um yeah that's that's right but yeah like the old ones would
[2839.12 → 2844.88] just kind of glow oh incandescence yeah yeah so there you didn't have the flicker problem well they ran off
[2844.88 → 2850.72] they ran directly off of ac so theoretically they should flicker but because you were just heating up a
[2850.72 → 2857.52] thing an element uh it wouldn't cool down enough in between the cycles for it to be a problem so it
[2857.52 → 2864.88] wasn't until we started doing things digitally that we were like oh whoops um and anytime you had a
[2864.88 → 2870.96] dimmable bulb they just oh man did they ever suck in the early days Emily shebang has said uh in
[2870.96 → 2876.48] flow plane chat said I'm autistic terrible sensory issues and can see the tiniest micro flicker possible and
[2876.48 → 2882.00] it's uh triggered my seizures yeah so flicker is bad, and apparently it affects at least some people
[2882.00 → 2889.60] people that don't have those problems' no i as far as uh as far as I have heard it's like technically
[2889.60 → 2897.12] bad for all of us to a certain degree um I don't know was that one merch message
[2899.20 → 2904.24] good lord I'm either perfect at this or terrible at it um thank you for sending a nice
[2904.24 → 2908.40] merch message depends what we're trying to accomplish okay yeah yeah go for it Dan um
[2908.40 → 2915.36] why don't we do a second one, and then we'll get into the sauce stuff sure um let's see good day
[2915.36 → 2922.40] tall slightly shorter and short why is my download speed in Australia so slow I've noticed over in
[2922.40 → 2928.88] northern America speeds are two to three times faster very jealous cheers how tall are you Dan six foot two
[2928.88 → 2932.00] or sorry, sorry five foot 14
[2935.04 → 2935.44] get out
[2938.16 → 2939.28] I can't out my head
[2943.04 → 2950.08] oh hold on the female audience in float plane chat says yes, and you never answered if it was about
[2950.08 → 2958.08] projectors oh um these days I would say you can get a short throw with relatively low distortion however
[2958.08 → 2965.76] I will say that compared to an ultra short throw the higher end cinema models do still tend to be
[2965.76 → 2975.20] um short throw or like normal is throw lengths and those tend to be the higher quality models that
[2975.20 → 2981.44] have features like lens shift that make it much easier to get perfect alignment uh etc, etc so and
[2981.44 → 2986.96] they're like just giant bulbs right there you go okay sorry uh what was the new one uh yes why is the
[2986.96 → 2992.40] internet slow in Australia um because you're a penal colony and nobody cares about you
[2995.44 → 3003.68] I'm glad somebody said it um the actual reason is the ocean because there's limited tubes
[3003.68 → 3012.96] what they call if it's the internet is not a big lorry well now and everybody's cutting them that
[3012.96 → 3016.96] doesn't help yeah those darn sharks Willie's not helping way to go china
[3022.32 → 3027.76] all right uh are we what are we doing now do you want to do the game do you want to do another topic
[3027.76 → 3032.24] and then the game I guess we should probably do the game which I just lost and so did all of you
[3032.88 → 3033.04] oh
[3033.04 → 3037.04] oh
[3042.00 → 3048.96] okay so um I was handed this backpack yes don't open the backpack just yet yeah I'm supposed to not
[3048.96 → 3055.36] see or something yeah I put the talk away close your eyes do uh turn them in 360 degrees and walk away
[3055.36 → 3061.76] one commuter back okay that's an old reference still checks out I get it vintage
[3064.40 → 3068.72] okay now what do you read the thing oh wait I have to close my eyes no, no I close my eyes' oh he
[3068.72 → 3076.00] closes his eyes my eyes are closed let's play a game lime day you don't have to you don't have to
[3076.00 → 3084.24] close your eyes I don't me yeah no just close the dock it's fine okay lime day our annual sales event
[3084.24 → 3090.08] where we squeeze our margins and bring you sweet deals is happening next week starting Wednesday
[3090.08 → 3096.56] July 9th but instead of just listing out the deals you can expect we thought it'd be fun to play a
[3096.56 → 3103.76] little game Luke yes we're going to show you five different items that are going to be on sale or in a
[3103.76 → 3110.40] bundle during lime day okay you have one guess to figure out what each item is
[3110.40 → 3120.88] but here's the catch the picture is going to be very zoomed in oh, oh and if you don't get at least
[3120.88 → 3128.08] three out of five you have to take a bite out of this lime oh but if you do get three out of five
[3128.80 → 3134.64] minus has to I take a bite out of the line all right I don't think I'll mind taking the bite out of
[3134.64 → 3140.56] the lime so hopefully with skin i with skin I mean I would assume so yeah just chomping oh
[3141.52 → 3146.40] right inside of it do you have to consume the whole thing no just take a bite I think you have
[3146.40 → 3151.76] to at least chew three times I'm fine with that I don't know if I want to yeah I don't think you have
[3151.76 → 3155.44] to swallow okay yeah we don't do we yeah it's not that type of show
[3155.44 → 3163.76] not yet wait for after dark yeah really okay all right there's some interesting stuff because
[3163.76 → 3169.12] like both of our backpacks use reprieve right uh yes so like
[3171.68 → 3175.28] and then also last year there was stuff in lime day that we don't sell
[3175.84 → 3181.60] normally, so this might be kind of tough how am I supposed to see the things I guess Dan it'll pop
[3181.60 → 3186.56] up on-screen okay and then after you get it right or wrong we'll, we'll show you the full picture
[3186.56 → 3191.60] that it was based off of, and then we'll show you the item all right you ready for number one first item
[3195.52 → 3201.20] what product is that Luke I think I'm not going to eat this lime are you actually kidding me what's

[3255.76 → 3261.28] the thing that's in here I'm looking I have no idea oh I think it's I actually have two water bottles
[3261.28 → 3267.92] ah okay I guess they wanted me to point out that we have different sizes that's true oh sorry I got
[3267.92 → 3273.20] those wrong looking at stuff yep there we go you can just look up it's fine I'm just holding up
[3273.20 → 3278.40] water bottles I just don't look at the dock I had them wrong before now they're fixed don't look at the
[3278.40 → 3282.80] dock, and you're fine I've got the text uncovered i I'm not this is my what are you doing all right

[3336.80 → 3341.44] no that seems fair it's going to take forever if you do that that seems okay you have to close the

[3975.84 → 3980.72] oh wow that's tough yeah I watched you really try like he gave it a shot
[3982.72 → 3983.84] do you want to open it up first
[3983.84 → 3991.04] oh I am I I swear I'm like really trying to break this thing
[3994.00 → 3997.60] do you want me to do it to the contest was kind of messed up I can join you in this if you would
[3997.60 → 4002.16] like I mean that's that's your call if you want to eat a lime you can eat a lime I won't stop you
[4002.16 → 4012.32] I don't know if I can get in there or not
[4013.84 → 4015.84] oh
[4020.08 → 4024.64] sure oh man did you swallow the peel nope I'm just still going
[4026.48 → 4030.88] you know it's turning kind of nice it starts terrible, but it gets pretty okay do you need
[4030.88 → 4037.04] do you need a bucket I got juice all over my laptop mm-hmm I got it mostly on my pants' oh
[4037.04 → 4044.08] uh it's also like all on one side which is really well I mean it depends what side it's hanging down
[4044.08 → 4045.92] right that's what I was it's supposed to hang
[4045.92 → 4060.40] okay we did it nice job did anyone think to have like a napkin or anything handy for this or I don't think so nice
[4060.40 → 4067.12] oh I mean we deserved that yeah well I did I don't know if you did I'm blocked by a TV sorry
[4068.48 → 4074.16] also you mentioned how like them helping me was not helping me it's they were actually
[4074.16 → 4079.36] unhelpful where is it on the website it's not on the website the wan backpack it's not exactly I don't
[4079.36 → 4084.16] know what they're talking about dude they were I didn't know that they legitimately are like I am
[4084.16 → 4089.04] losing, but this is the only thing I can think makes sense I went from being like kind of annoyed
[4089.04 → 4093.76] because they were giving you a bunch of hints in this game that was supposed to be a game to kind
[4093.76 → 4101.68] of annoyed because they were like sabotaging you yeah that was it was just Sammy I repeatedly like i
[4101.68 → 4105.76] thought screwdriver would not have been possible because they said it wasn't on the website but i
[4105.76 → 4112.00] understand what he meant that variant wasn't yeah I think i I was super confused because I didn't
[4112.00 → 4119.92] know that variant existed on my monitors that's sort of orange yeah so I thought it was a colour problem
[4119.92 → 4125.20] this monitor is extremely red yeah I thought it was a colour problem so I thought because of that it
[4125.20 → 4130.32] wasn't the screwdriver because they said it wasn't on the website so I was like what else can it possibly
[4130.32 → 4136.88] be none of see I knew that everything was fine and working completely normally and that his guess
[4136.88 → 4145.04] was good, but we just had to sit through like four minutes of you guys misleading him I was uninformed
[4145.04 → 4153.12] just get on with it yeah okay so buy things uh next topic jeez buy our products so that we don't have
[4153.12 → 4159.84] to do this again what is this stupid show also in my defence and definitely the angle is way off but
[4159.84 → 4164.24] I thought it was this but way more zoomed in for the water bottle yeah this is not I thought
[4164.24 → 4170.16] it was like it is the water bottle yeah half of it is the water bottle no I get it no, no that's just
[4170.16 → 4174.48] what he's going for the neck I see what he's going for yeah i just thought it was like a
[4174.48 → 4179.68] slightly weird photo I'm picking up what you're throwing down the Germans have a word for everything
[4179.68 → 4185.92] on the last wan show we got into a discussion about whether leg is a big company or a
[4185.92 → 4190.48] small company and i kind of tried to describe or the way that I ultimately described it was
[4191.60 → 4197.28] we're a big enough company that a credit union cannot service our business properly yeah, but we're
[4197.28 → 4203.20] too small of a company for the big multinational banks to like really care about us no, no no to care
[4203.20 → 4213.92] about us at all like at all anyway Redditor atrium underscore reached out with a German word that
[4213.92 → 4221.04] defines us, and apparently it is Mitterrand which according to Wikipedia commonly refers to a group
[4221.04 → 4227.28] of stable business enterprises that have proved successful in enduring economic change and turbulence
[4227.28 → 4232.40] and is defined as a statistical category of small and medium-sized enterprises with annual revenues up to
[4232.40 → 4240.64] 50 million euro and a maximum of 500 employees so here's the uh here's the here's the the the
[4240.64 → 4247.28] little Wikipedia it would have been nice if we linked to the actual post uh but oh yeah no here it is
[4247.84 → 4253.76] here it is so the way that they defined it was a little bit differently uh we made up a word for this kind of company
[4253.76 → 4264.56] it's um okay yeah anyway no never mind yep cool good definition thank you that actually does help
[4265.68 → 4271.28] yeah we're we're a Mitterrand yeah is what our company is and there are complications with that
[4271.28 → 4279.28] the transition is painful surprisingly very difficult and painful and I can understand why a lot of companies
[4279.28 → 4288.16] might not make it like i have to confess when people told me that the um I forget people lay it out both
[4288.16 → 4296.32] in like revenue terms and in like headcount terms um but when people told me like oh yeah this transition
[4296.32 → 4302.48] when you grow from like 100 to 500 employees is where most companies die I always looked at it and went
[4302.48 → 4309.04] well like that's crazy why would that happen like if you're is you're profitable and doing great up to
[4309.04 → 4317.52] 80 employees what you have 110 employees, and you just go bankrupt um but what we're learning as we are
[4317.52 → 4326.56] as we have scaled to 100 over 100 back under 100 and then now over 100 over the course of the last like
[4326.56 → 4333.44] three years when we haven't really grown in headcount at all is that the communication and process
[4333.44 → 4338.64] challenges associated with crossing this threshold you effectively have to rebuild your entire company are
[4339.44 → 4345.12] painful, but the difference is that this time you're building the airplane while flying it whereas the
[4345.12 → 4353.84] first time um you were building the airplane and figuring out how to take off the runway like it's a very
[4353.84 → 4361.84] very different experience and there are so many more voices so many more vested interests it's um it's
[4361.84 → 4367.84] been challenging to put it lightly no I like it that way
[4373.84 → 4374.64] nothing changed
[4377.76 → 4380.72] and now way more people know about oh I saw their messages
[4380.72 → 4385.12] don't imagine this will bother even more people now
[4387.20 → 4396.80] I tried does it how is it better if they match I don't think so I really don't think so
[4399.28 → 4407.12] um well we'll see this is interesting the Colombian navy has snagged a Starlink equipped Marco sub
[4407.12 → 4413.60] on Wednesday this week the Colombian navy captured an unmanned semi-submersible that was equipped with a
[4413.60 → 4420.08] Starlink antenna this unmanned drone vessel is believed to have been a trial run for automated
[4420.08 → 4425.92] cocaine trafficking no drugs were found aboard the vessel but Colombian officials stated that it had the
[4425.92 → 4433.84] capacity to transport as much as one and a half tons of cocaine so it was a test run manned semi-submersibles
[4433.84 → 4438.32] clandestinely built in the jungle have been used for decades to ferry cocaine from Colombia to
[4438.32 → 4444.88] Central America and Mexico and have in recent years been found crossing the Atlantic and pacific oceans
[4446.32 → 4451.60] Colombian law calls for prison terms of up to 14 years for the use construction marketing
[4451.60 → 4457.60] possession and transportation of semi-submersibles that's obviously working great
[4457.60 → 4464.56] unmanned subs eliminate the possibility of a captured crew cooperating with authorities
[4465.20 → 4472.56] this is fascinating so I learned recently that um people were equipping planes with Starlink
[4473.20 → 4481.20] by just like putting the antenna like in the window of the front and just pointing it up and then Starlink
[4481.20 → 4485.36] because they're they have launched now i believe they've launched they've launched, or they're launching
[4485.36 → 4494.24] their um like their corporate jet service um Starlink has apparently countered this by doing a
[4494.24 → 4501.84] speed check and making sure that your receipt your receiver unit is not moving too fast
[4503.20 → 4507.36] because there's nothing that would prevent the service from working so then you want because they
[4507.36 → 4511.92] because what they're going to up charge the airlines i guess yeah, yeah well because they want the plane
[4511.92 → 4519.76] version to pay more yeah so uh Starlink uh what's it called not commercial corporate um
[4520.64 → 4523.36] airplane uh, uh price here
[4527.20 → 4533.04] for corporate and private jet applications Starlink aviation offers hardware for a hundred fifty
[4533.76 → 4541.60] thousand dollars with monthly service plans ranging from two thousand to twenty-five thousand dollars
[4541.92 → 4547.12] which honestly as far as my understanding goes is its about in line oh i thought it was cheaper
[4547.84 → 4554.48] uh i don't really think so for like a jumbo jet oh, oh that maybe okay sure I'm not talking about
[4554.48 → 4561.20] the installation at all no, no i have no idea on that possibly um yeah no but no it's apparently this
[4561.20 → 4566.96] is for business jets according to pilot mail says the AI summary so take that for take that for what it is
[4566.96 → 4570.80] you gotta watch them AI summaries business unlimited ten thousand dollars a month i think
[4570.80 → 4572.80] that's pretty competitive um
[4575.28 → 4582.88] so, so yeah uh and the interesting thing about it is from my understanding this basically just comes down
[4582.88 → 4590.08] to like certification and regulation because from what i heard from my uncle nothing prevented anyone
[4590.08 → 4597.20] from just putting the like ground-based Starlink in the cockpit and just pointing it up
[4597.76 → 4604.56] and getting Starlink service but with all the like certification and everything uh the prices do go
[4605.20 → 4613.52] up a lot because you're not allowed to just like to install you know Starlink in your own you know plane like
[4614.16 → 4619.92] it has to be done by a certified shop yeah not necessarily weird in a bad way, but apparently they take
[4619.92 → 4626.08] like fire resistance extremely seriously like to the nth degree like if you have a fire on a plane
[4626.08 → 4631.52] that's apparently the worst i mean makes sense it kind of does make sense yeah it makes perfect sense to me
[4631.52 → 4642.32] yeah um yeah please just open the window they really are just oxygen and fuel big containers of oxygen and
[4642.32 → 4648.96] big containers of fuel yeah everywhere the fire could go is terrible yeah
[4648.96 → 4657.76] yeah oh boy let's see if i can find this yeah everything everything everything plain is just
[4658.72 → 4668.48] whatever it costs on land um times you know a bunch yeah now consider space
[4669.44 → 4672.96] oh dude the last place not ruined by capitalism
[4672.96 → 4679.52] space give him time if you don't know that reference look it up it's amazing its amazing
[4679.52 → 4684.40] it's amazing watching him like crack up as he says he's having such a good time do you want to you
[4684.40 → 4687.76] want to play another little game sure okay
[4687.76 → 4705.12] this is an USB outlet okay it has USB c at 15 watts and USA at 15 watts how much do you think this module costs
[4706.08 → 4716.48] this is for a plane uh yes this is from mcico.com true blue power assuming a very substantial price
[4716.48 → 4721.12] increase off of what this would cost a consumer i think I'm still going to be
[4721.92 → 4725.44] intensely low but I'm going to say 125 bucks
[4727.68 → 4737.60] oh well as low as 423 dollars okay hold on one sec so adding USB c because the one beside it was
[4737.60 → 4744.88] exactly the same but no, no USB c right so adding USB c is like over 200 uh i think you mean as low as
[4744.88 → 4754.16] oh 213 dollars hold on but wait there's more okay let's say for instance because that's just
[4754.16 → 4762.16] regular old like crappy USB c where it's just doing the voltages and amperages of an USA port, but it's
[4762.16 → 4772.32] just shaped like an USB c port huh okay how about the appropriately named 6430 360-21
[4772.32 → 4779.84] this does USB cpd oh 100 watts at 5 amps and then USA at 15 watts
[4781.04 → 4784.32] considering, so the last one was 425 is that right yeah something like that
[4785.52 → 4792.80] I'm going to say 1100 oh you're actually high this time oh that's actually a much lower increase than i
[4792.80 → 4800.48] expected seven undo i mean that's obviously absurd but i expected them to just go even harder dude that's
[4800.48 → 4807.12] like freaking wild it's like a's like more than 10x uh oh actually i don't know if that's more than
[4807.12 → 4813.44] 10x because i was shopping for an USB PD like outlet to put in my wall the other day decently expensive
[4813.44 → 4816.80] and they're they're pretty expensive that's why i thought it was going to be so much more I'm actually
[4816.80 → 4822.56] surprised the lift on that is as low as it is wow Luke's so out of touch john mash says oh 700
[4822.56 → 4827.12] that's actually a much better deal than i expected i wonder if that's the bulk deal if you get 10 000 of
[4827.12 → 4837.04] them oh dude as low as who knows MOQ 100 what i don't know did that say oh no, no no, no no, no no
[4837.04 → 4843.12] that's that'd be crazy that'd be crazy that's all that's all absurd because like how much would
[4843.12 → 4854.72] like I'm I'm just thinking cables because you could just if you just mounted extensions into like an uh
[4854.72 → 4868.08] a 3d printed little square yeah it's like 30 bucks yeah like nothing sheesh wild um this is uh
[4868.08 → 4874.64] j Ritchie 1984 says this is why experimental aviation is so much less expensive i can add a
[4874.64 → 4882.08] USB power outlet to a van's rv7 for like 30 bucks I'm not actually familiar with the van's rv7 so i
[4882.08 → 4888.00] looked it up and this is it popular two-seat single-engine low-wing home-built aircraft kit
[4888.00 → 4894.16] known for its sporty handling and performance dude how is it that like
[4894.16 → 4902.88] like i don't know how is it that i keep discovering stuff this cool that i have never heard of so if
[4902.88 → 4910.88] you want you can buy a kit airplane and fly it, and it's known for its sporty are you serious right now
[4910.88 → 4917.44] if you want some interesting info and i and i can't explain why i know this, but it's not for me
[4917.44 → 4924.08] I'll put that out there first bc actually has really fantastic laws for experimental aircraft
[4924.08 → 4929.28] they are allowed to be much heavier here than a lot of places in the states meaning you can put like
[4929.28 → 4935.28] better engines and better wings and more fuel than you can in the states it's a big problem in the
[4935.28 → 4940.24] states you really get limited by weight really intensely and our limit is like genuinely i think like
[4940.24 → 4944.56] five times higher like it's not it's not a little bit of an increase it's very substantial
[4945.36 → 4949.76] and yeah they fall under experimental I'm trying to look up the um
[4951.12 → 4959.04] EC experiment like how much are these standard kits okay hold on standard kits here we go
[4959.68 → 4964.80] this means the fabrication work we do on the kit parts is less than 50 of the total required to
[4964.80 → 4970.16] complete the aircraft oh that's what makes it a kit so you have to oh good lord you have to provide
[4970.16 → 4977.44] the engine the prop the instruments the avionics and the upholstery yeah uh okay
[4979.44 → 4982.32] standard build kit that's a plane
[4985.44 → 4993.68] that's a plane so that you get this in the mail Justin can make it that is dude those panels don't
[4993.68 → 4999.36] even look bent you have to shape them yourself oh no you would um you would fold them and rivet them to
[4999.36 → 5006.00] this the subframe wouldn't you yeah we do not do the small trimming and adjusting jobs which the
[5006.00 → 5012.72] average home builder in the average shop can do just as well as we can okay trim in this context i
[5012.72 → 5020.16] think means like like like adjust the thing so that it like flies in a straight line that's what we mean
[5020.16 → 5024.56] by trimming right maybe the panels fit together i don't think that's what that means it says we
[5024.56 → 5030.00] do not do the small trimming and adjusting jobs that's making the panels i think they're talking
[5030.00 → 5032.96] about the panels okay trimming the panels I'm fairly certain
[5035.52 → 5041.76] okay sure RV kits are going to need another garage you'll find we want to continuously improve them
[5041.76 → 5046.32] the biggest improvement okay so where's where's the price trim is an active adjustment you do in
[5046.32 → 5052.24] flight that's a normal thing I'm just saying I'm just saying you do it yourself that's all
[5052.24 → 5060.08] kit build aircraft okay so RV rv7 was the one that the person said here we go so uh kit order form
[5060.08 → 5067.92] okay what do these cost like i have no idea throw some stuff in their yeah i can start clicking okay
[5067.92 → 5075.20] well I'll need one okay includes electric aileron trim okay yeah good wing kit I'll need wings probably
[5075.20 → 5083.84] probably for my aircraft you could make your own oh you can get a quick build wing uh add quick build
[5083.84 → 5090.32] wing okay, so this is basically oh, oh yeah okay so that's another like five grand four
[5090.32 → 5096.80] four four four grand oh uh fuselage kit I'm i I might need a fuselage you might need to sit somewhere
[5096.80 → 5103.60] yeah I received my centre section with my wing kit so I have possession of it already i
[5103.60 → 5109.68] i uh sure I guess it comes with my wing kit uh I don't need a quick build I'll build my fuselage
[5109.68 → 5117.04] okay i wanna oh I want a sliding canopy obviously sliding is so sick obviously I have finishing kit
[5117.04 → 5129.36] whoa okay I mean uh spinner type um uh okay ship two wow seriously there you go I mean I'm less than
[5129.36 → 5133.20] Bryce well you don't have an engine yeah I'm I'm sure I'm missing some stuff you don't have a seat
[5133.20 → 5136.88] that was the price today it was actually 58
[5139.52 → 5144.96] that's what you have to pay now yeah go back and look at the page the kit total amount to pay today
[5144.96 → 5155.60] uh there you deposit you still don't have an engine no okay but still like realistically I'm up in the air
[5155.60 → 5163.04] for probably less than like my Tynan oh yeah like what does like how fast does one of these fly like
[5163.04 → 5169.52] is it like RV how is this a thing how does how is your business making
[5170.80 → 5178.72] build yourself aircraft oh sorry so the maximum takeoff weight of 50 uh 544 kilograms or 1200 pounds
[5178.72 → 5184.96] you can have one or two seats, and they must have a stall speed of 39 knots or fewer oh okay no design
[5184.96 → 5194.24] standards that's for ultra light airplanes, but there's like lots of other things going on oh was
[5194.24 → 5199.92] this was this plane specifically on there doesn't it down yeah down to down down down
[5199.92 → 5205.44] oh here we go uh oh no, no no I saw the seven and I thought we were I thought it was rv7, but it's
[5205.44 → 5213.44] beach 77 something but yeah like down in the America the um the weight is much lower as
[5213.44 → 5219.44] far as I know at least in California America gets weird about laws because their whole state system
[5219.44 → 5228.40] thing so I don't know okay so the vans aircraft rv7 uh apparently has a top speed of 350 kilometres an hour
[5228.40 → 5236.40] which is something that is man that is so okay what engine is that with though because isn't
[5236.40 → 5242.48] isn't the rv7 oh that is that a kid or no I think you'd probably have to have a like a rated max speed
[5242.48 → 5248.16] of the chassis like you couldn't just put any engine you want on it and go 900 kilometres an hour and rip
[5248.16 → 5255.12] the freaking thing apart right the AI overview seems to think it's legal in Canada that's crazy who knows
[5255.12 → 5262.64] what that means this actually explains something that I have wondered about a lot like dude Facebook
[5262.64 → 5272.64] marketplace is full of airplanes and really yeah oh dude airplanes because I've told you like i
[5272.64 → 5279.04] I train my Facebook marketplace algorithm to just show me the wildest stuff, and so I started clicking on
[5279.04 → 5285.60] like airplanes for a bit there's so many aircraft on Facebook marketplace and this raises so many
[5285.60 → 5291.12] questions for me why do all these people own aircraft why do they buy and sell them on Facebook
[5291.12 → 5296.32] marketplace of all places like i just I couldn't wrap my brain around it yeah it's totally legal in
[5296.32 → 5305.28] Canada I had no idea that the pricing for them was this accessible like sure it's really expensive but
[5305.28 → 5309.76] when you compare it to what people will spend on like you know a boat or whatever it's not that
[5309.76 → 5317.52] different whereas I just assumed like oh yeah you know a car is expensive a boat is more expensive and
[5317.52 → 5323.68] a plane is like way more expensive i just thought they were like way more expensive, but it's like
[5325.12 → 5330.32] it's expensive, but yeah compared to what people might spend on their boat and all of their you know
[5330.32 → 5335.52] um like water-skiing gear, or you know whatever right like
[5337.52 → 5343.04] sure cool what are we supposed to be talking about why don't we do sponsors hold on I found you an engine
[5343.60 → 5350.32] oh yeah, yeah okay what am I gonna what am I going to pay for if it's a becoming engine uh I'm not seeing it
[5353.60 → 5358.32] 100 grand yeah that's the most powerful engine I could find that works in that oh you could get a
[5358.32 → 5365.12] rebuilt one for like 55 grand dudes you could totally be in the air for like Tynan price 215 horsepower i
[5365.12 → 5373.52] say do it 210 to 215 horsepower this is not this is not me I'm not doing this you're not doing this no
[5373.52 → 5380.00] I know this stuff because of someone else not me I bet i i bet Luke's getting into aviation no
[5380.00 → 5384.88] that's that I'd love to he runs a site called float plane, and he just couldn't handle it anymore see
[5384.88 → 5388.96] that's the problem this wouldn't work for me because I can't land on water so I could put you
[5388.96 → 5393.52] in touch with my old neighbour who used to get crashed out float planes and rebuild them and then
[5393.52 → 5400.00] fly them and that is not a made-up anecdote that is real why do you always know a guy literally I've
[5400.00 → 5406.40] had a very exciting life I've told you about him before yeah I think you have yeah but from
[5406.40 → 5410.72] what I'm sure there's some other one but from like literally two minutes of research that's the most
[5410.72 → 5417.20] powerful engine that fits in the rv7 I mean he was excited that he found a replacement plastic light
[5417.20 → 5424.08] cover, and it was only 80 us dollars it's about the size of like less than your fist how happy would
[5424.08 → 5428.56] he is with 3d printing now because I think with these experiment it would not be rated for flight
[5428.56 → 5436.56] but I mean these were these are like oh yeah yeah we're still in the oh maybe the rv7 is a plane
[5436.56 → 5440.88] because I was wondering maybe you could get like a crashed out flow plane fix it get it reclassified
[5440.88 → 5445.76] and certified as an experimental, and then you'd have a flow plane for you know a couple of hundred
[5445.76 → 5452.40] thousand dollars that's still a lot of money though I also wonder how often would you find years of time
[5452.40 → 5458.16] to reassemble it yourself yeah so the rv7 is technically considered an experimental aircraft
[5458.16 → 5462.56] yeah I wonder what it would take to get something uh reclassified as experimental
[5462.56 → 5468.08] oh you just scream it I think you'd have to substantially rebuild and fit within the
[5468.08 → 5471.76] requirements like the weight limits and stuff does it have to be built from nothing dealing with
[5472.48 → 5477.92] plane pontoons retrofit limits might be a little difficult yeah I don't know
[5479.36 → 5483.36] sorry I'm just signing in to Facebook to show you guys all the airplanes
[5483.36 → 5488.08] not that I'm not enjoying it thoroughly
[5489.84 → 5494.48] but what what what topic is this was this a merch message I don't know who cares topic yeah what even
[5494.48 → 5498.40] is this show Luke it doesn't matter this was you talking about Starlink
[5502.08 → 5507.20] I have uh I've just stopped trying to pull you back on top there's no point i was just
[5507.20 → 5512.88] better just curious we're going to do sponsors though so at some point at some point but we gotta
[5512.88 → 5519.04] stall so Linus can sign in to his Facebook account after having to go through 700 prices uh yeah well
[5519.04 → 5523.76] I mean this guy basically he had like five acres behind us, and he basically had a double airplane
[5523.76 → 5529.04] hangar on his property to rebuild these in how insane would it be to just take the wings off and
[5529.04 → 5536.40] park it at your house um some of them actually do have foldable wings they fold up foldable yeah um or you
[5536.40 → 5541.44] can take them off yeah that's a flipped over truck is that for sale are these Hummel doing what i
[5541.44 → 5547.12] think they're doing no they're not um I didn't see that at first
[5550.08 → 5553.20] is that the pool mobile from the Simpsons
[5554.32 → 5559.36] it's a truck it's a trade what oh I thought it was a pool yeah it looked like a pool
[5559.36 → 5567.84] okay, okay I want this dude my face look at the jeep look at the flipped over jeep
[5570.88 → 5577.76] please what's that thousand dollar jeep i have to know wow um actually you put some body kits on
[5577.76 → 5582.80] those jaguar f-types, and they look sick just saying I don't like them by default do you have to go get
[5582.80 → 5587.36] it yourself a thousand kilometres it's flipped over delete if not okay
[5590.40 → 5595.20] one picture you just have to go get it yourself oh my goodness it is literally just one picture
[5595.20 → 5601.20] that's amazing that's it you just yeah you just go get it I guess dude I told you I told you this is
[5601.20 → 5610.08] unbelievable I train my Facebook marketplace to be just the wildest stuff I would pay money for that
[5610.08 → 5616.24] you could import someone's like algorithm training commercial that would be so cool um oh my god what is
[5616.24 → 5622.80] that definitely look at this lady definitely not creepy monkey 50
[5625.52 → 5636.40] probably collectible probably not man oh my goodness oh man oh this is great just incredibly
[5636.40 → 5643.76] weird things and then like yeah really expensive cars yeah yeah oh man this is great home business
[5643.76 → 5649.76] and it just shows like candy stuff here's an original series recorder functional prop replica because
[5649.76 → 5656.08] yeah that makes sense for me to be shopping for I guess uh here's some stuff from uh scrapyard wars
[5656.08 → 5662.48] no spoilers though nope here's a 3d led dance floor sure I'll take two
[5662.48 → 5671.04] what is happening what is happening what the heck at least you know at least they put up a real price
[5671.04 → 5676.24] for it yeah I'll give them that yeah to their credit they didn't do that they did do that
[5676.24 → 5685.44] oh, oh gee McConnell stuff I don't like I don't like that I want to do some clown whippets no, thank you
[5685.44 → 5689.68] oh my god
[5689.76 → 5698.40] do you want a nacho and cheese warmer oh my goodness uh anyway um oh I thought it was ranch uh
[5698.40 → 5705.52] anyway airplanes um no i forget what airplanes are under okay so here here I'll
[5705.52 → 5711.84] show you I'll show you wouldn't believe how many planes are on Facebook marketplace like here's just
[5711.84 → 5719.12] here's just a casual float plane dude like people put up oh beaver's a classic yeah yeah buddy oh hell
[5719.12 → 5724.64] yeah it's like the first time cars were listed one bay like who's listing a 600 000 plane on Facebook
[5724.64 → 5732.40] love me a good beaver you know that's so wild why would I put it oh my goodness dude what a
[5732.96 → 5739.44] reupholster that what a choice what a choice you could ride your Harley to the dock I'm super and then
[5739.44 → 5747.60] ride your Harley plane through the sky pontoon planes and loud motorcycles oh dude dude dude
[5748.08 → 5759.52] float plane 160k let's go in maple ridge bc why do they have this air why well the thing is what the
[5759.52 → 5764.32] cool thing about having a float plane is you just drive it on the water, and then you can take off for
[5764.32 → 5770.32] whenever you want I mean in fairness some of these are thanks dad some of these are obviously like
[5770.32 → 5774.88] fake it makes it cheaper you don't have to store it in an in an airport like you can't call this a
[5774.88 → 5786.96] biplane if it goes three different ways oh here fixed wing ultralight can I interest you in an 1800
[5786.96 → 5792.08] dollar aircraft from 100 mile houses would you get in this no
[5794.16 → 5801.68] is that how are you doing is that where you do your trimming look yeah yeah oh it needs
[5801.68 → 5809.60] some TLC just needs a tune bro just needs a tune oh my god oh my god, but yeah like dude you could be
[5809.60 → 5816.64] flying you could be flying an aircraft for okay hold on why is that so cheap nose actuator rod broke
[5816.64 → 5821.60] attachment point to down lock torn off okay then oh this one needs some work okay let's find the
[5821.60 → 5827.76] let's find the cheapest one functional plane that just like is ready to fly beautiful well-built great
[5827.76 → 5838.48] reputation USD 65 000 you could literally pick this up in like 30 minutes, and it works apparently
[5838.48 → 5846.48] like is that crazy or what that is pretty nuts that's like 60 65k 65 000 us dollars you are in an
[5846.48 → 5852.96] airplane now obviously this is like what I don't know if I want a 65 000 no that's fair enough
[5852.96 → 5857.84] but this is like what I was talking to you about a while back with that like that uh that lead on the
[5857.84 → 5863.76] gamer jet where I was like I guarantee you it's way cheaper than you think, and you were like no and I was
[5863.76 → 5870.64] like yeah it's it seats nine, and it's a million dollars, and you were like what so with this and
[5870.64 → 5877.12] with that it's very weird the truth is the bulk of the cost is in the operating of it yeah you got
[5877.12 → 5881.36] to have the hang you got unless you're unless you're working on it yourself unless you're even allowed to
[5881.36 → 5884.96] work on it yourself which for the experimental ones I guess you'd be able to but for like a
[5884.96 → 5890.72] commercial one I don't know the cost per hour of flying them is insane the engineering the fuel
[5890.72 → 5898.64] um but anyway i just i got a kick out of the fact that you can get a functioning airplane
[5899.12 → 5906.24] for 65 000 us dollars like literally less than a cyber truck, and you would look like way less of a
[5906.24 → 5912.24] tool you could like to take it off the back of the cyber truck dude don't give people ideas like
[5912.24 → 5915.52] that you know they'll want if you drive the cyber truck fast enough down the road
[5915.52 → 5927.20] way does the plane break through the top of the cyber truck before you get off the end uh why don't
[5927.20 → 5933.36] we do sponsor spots the show is brought to you today by delete me I think we've all been there right
[5933.92 → 5941.36] waiting for an important call the phone finally rings and to your excitement or dread you have to listen
[5941.36 → 5945.60] once again to a text-to-speech voice asking you to pay duties for a package you never ordered
[5946.80 → 5954.00] but how did they even get your number and what can you do about it have no fear delete me is here
[5954.00 → 5959.52] they'll take the info that you give them, and they will scour the web finding potential bad actors that
[5959.52 → 5965.52] have their grubby little hands on your personal identifiers then they will regularly send out removal
[5965.52 → 5970.00] requests on your behalf with quarterly progress reports showing you how much data was removed from the
[5970.00 → 5975.44] web and where from, and it's not just you up to three other loved ones can receive delete me's
[5975.44 → 5982.00] protection as well with their family plans so go join delete me.com at delete me.com
[5982.00 → 5988.00] slash want to get 20 off a plan today I fumbled that but hey I think we got the point delete me.com
[5988.00 → 5994.16] slash wan the show is also brought to you by zero bounce sending out an email and getting an address
[5994.16 → 5998.80] not found error kind of sucks it's like trying to dribble a basketball that's not pumped up enough
[6000.00 → 6007.28] what is this why did anyone shoot this stock foot okay it doesn't matter is it so much build up
[6007.28 → 6011.04] so much disappointment is this fake I'm trying to figure that out
[6012.96 → 6018.48] the actions in the background seem pretty believable no I think it's real I think it's
[6018.48 → 6024.40] I think it's just really weird stock footage so skeptical of everything now I know zero bounce
[6024.40 → 6029.12] lets you dribble up and down the court and minimize those turnovers they can take your existing list of
[6029.12 → 6034.24] email addresses and validate they're all still active leading to lower email bounce rates and
[6034.24 → 6040.24] your important messages landing in actual inboxes and not just spam folders they also have an email
[6040.24 → 6044.56] finder which can identify a valid email address using a person's name and domain in real time
[6044.56 → 6048.96] and outbound marketing or sales specialists dream and zero bounce also integrates with popular
[6048.96 → 6054.24] platforms like HubSpot and Zapier so it can seamlessly plug into your workflow you can save 20
[6054.24 → 6060.64] on any of their plans by heading to our link in the video description today finally the show is brought
[6060.64 → 6068.00] you by am dour latest AMD ultimate tech upgrade dropped yesterday and if you're wondering yes it is as
[6068.00 → 6077.04] chaotic as you would expect i the highlights for me are definitely um the awkward energy it's funny I saw
[6077.04 → 6082.88] a lot of comments saying that the video was not that awkward it's amazing what the magic of video
[6082.88 → 6092.00] editing will do say the edit really made it feel not that awkward it was um it was really awkward in a
[6092.00 → 6099.60] bad way for probably the first like hour and a half of the shoot bad way, and then it got way more awkward
[6099.60 → 6106.00] and it came full circle to in a good way for the rest of the shoot it was a lot of fun we had a
[6106.00 → 6112.40] total blast okay uh Natalie's upgrade oh well no it was all on me like a hundred percent like
[6113.36 → 6116.72] sometimes I just blurt things out and I don't know if they're going to work
[6116.72 → 6123.52] and sometimes the stuff I say is super weird and then I'm just like yeah we should probably cut
[6123.52 → 6133.44] that in the edit the piano joke was genuinely like probably one of your best pun jokes ever made
[6133.44 → 6141.04] like it got me pretty good it got me I couldn't even do the delivery of it was genuinely very good I was just
[6141.04 → 6155.36] like okay so if you haven't seen the video i was i was unpacking like this uh this keyboard and um
[6156.56 → 6163.76] and I was like okay everyone how do you know this is the best instrument the number one oh man i
[6163.76 → 6169.12] flubbed it you did I flubbed the setup how do you know this is the number one instrument how
[6169.12 → 6176.16] well they don't call it a poo Anna which apparently didn't land with a lot of people
[6176.80 → 6182.24] because they don't have like number one for p number two for have to go like for little kids
[6182.24 → 6188.16] but to everyone here it is made sense I thought it was hilarious I assure you it made sense
[6188.16 → 6194.08] um anyway it was a lot of fun and as always am dare the ones making it possible and like with every
[6194.08 → 6201.84] upgrade AMD has a giveaway to go along with it this time they're giving away one of two sapphire
[6201.84 → 6210.16] nitro plus AMD Radeon Rx 9070 XT GPUs, and you can enter today by clicking on our link in the video
[6210.16 → 6216.40] description, but hurry there are only a few days left all right
[6216.40 → 6227.60] yeah what do you want to talk about should we find some good news what do we get not much oh
[6228.40 → 6234.00] we have Microsoft adding a free option to Windows 10 extended security updates program yeah Windows 10
[6234.00 → 6240.32] users have a new option to receive security updates beyond the October 2025 end of life the previously
[6240.32 → 6247.20] announced esu program allows users to pay 30 or and I think this is the free option
[6247.20 → 6253.76] 1 000 Microsoft reward points no, no that's one of the old paid options oh yeah and that would give
[6253.76 → 6259.04] you an additional year of Windows 10 security updates making it safe to keep using I guess yeah
[6259.04 → 6267.20] the new third option requires users to sync their pc settings to one drive via a Microsoft account using
[6267.20 → 6274.96] the windows backup app and presumably giving up some privacy in return for updates oh this is
[6274.96 → 6281.76] very from the enrolment screenshot pc settings may also include installed apps and credentials pretty
[6281.76 → 6292.48] interesting so we've talked a fair bit in fact we had a video I think on tech quickie Linus windows free
[6292.48 → 6302.08] about how windows is effectively um yeah here we go so this tech wiki video from five years ago
[6302.08 → 6310.48] is like why windows is free now it's not free, but it's clear that Microsoft's efforts from the late 90s
[6310.48 → 6318.32] and the 2000s uh to prevent people actively like aggressively prevent people from pirating windows
[6318.32 → 6325.44] windows have been discontinued for ages yeah at this point you literally can go to Microsoft's website
[6325.44 → 6332.08] download a window ISO and install it on a computer and just say I don't have a product key and run
[6332.08 → 6338.16] windows, and it will as far as I can tell other than not letting you set some personalization options
[6338.16 → 6342.56] background, and you can still set a background by just right-clicking an image and then setting as desktop
[6342.56 → 6348.56] background doesn't block you yeah you just can't do it in the personalization menu like as unless that
[6348.56 → 6354.40] workaround has been patched or whatever but the point is they just clearly don't really care and I think
[6354.40 → 6361.68] this is yet another illustration that they just don't care like you could have an old Windows license
[6361.68 → 6367.68] that you've upgraded to Windows 10 that they would offer to upgrade you to Windows 11 if you met the
[6367.68 → 6371.84] hardware requirements, and now they're basically even saying okay forget it don't even bother with the
[6371.84 → 6376.08] hardware requirements you can stay on Windows 10 just please please please have a
[6376.08 → 6379.84] Microsoft account because at the end of the day Microsoft is going the direction of basically
[6379.84 → 6387.04] everybody else where it's free to use, and you give up your privacy data yeah you give up your data in
[6387.04 → 6394.80] return so what would you do right because your choice is Linux is not an answer I did hold on
[6396.56 → 6401.12] hold on why is Linux not an answer Linux is not an answer because there's whole government
[6401.12 → 6406.40] switching over because you are a kid and all your friends play a game that has kernel level
[6406.40 → 6411.76] anti-cheat there that's why so what would you do you're running Windows 10 because you like
[6411.76 → 6417.28] Windows 10 better and Windows 11 is bad you would, I would never under any circumstances run Windows 11
[6417.28 → 6425.04] because you're a gig chad like dos dude one okay your options are run it without security updates
[6425.04 → 6430.16] upgrade to Windows 11 or sign in to your Microsoft account and sync all your stuff
[6431.20 → 6436.88] let's say those are your three options which would you take Windows 11 you would just go Windows 11
[6436.88 → 6440.56] and just pirate it oh and then do customizations
[6442.80 → 6446.40] okay I didn't give you those options though so you're you play but I'm a kid so I have
[6446.40 → 6452.88] gained the option of pirating it you said I'm a kid um going back to when I was a kid that was a
[6455.12 → 6460.56] a low bar to walk over like didn't require a hop you had to step up a little bit
[6463.60 → 6471.52] okay uh people are questioning what dos dude one is dos dude one is not a what dos dude one is a man
[6471.52 → 6478.24] and we did a collab with him recently uh upgrading the storage on a macBook it was super cool
[6479.36 → 6485.60] all right you guys are definitely going to want to check that out okay I mean yeah i I think we are
[6485.60 → 6490.80] long overdue no security updates on my operating system no I think we're long overdue for like a
[6490.80 → 6498.88] deep loading windows episode because there's do you remember the Windows 9 thing I do that guy reached
[6498.88 → 6504.56] out recently really yeah oh interesting yeah I'd be I'd be down to do another like apparently he's
[6504.56 → 6510.32] still doing stuff bloat your windows let me um I don't have an easy way to access the message now
[6510.32 → 6516.88] but yeah that's okay Dan will email you a reminder I don't think merch message dashboard is like super
[6516.88 → 6524.88] super busy tonight I think he's good is that okay Dan yeah, thank you don't email it though thank you
[6524.88 → 6534.00] you thank you that's a weird way to put it um well no he just I want to do a poll I want to I want to
[6534.00 → 6540.96] hear from the people and I'm not giving them a custom option Dan can we make a poll so Windows 10 raw
[6540.96 → 6549.76] dog Windows 10 signed in and Windows 11 those are the only options so you have to pick one of those
[6549.76 → 6556.24] three options so do you have to buy Windows 11 no because I assume that you can upgrade to it let's
[6556.24 → 6566.88] say you can upgrade to Windows 11. Windows 10 raw dog yep Windows 10 signed in yep and Windows 11. Okay
[6567.60 → 6570.24] I want to know which one all right we're hitting float plane with a poll
[6570.88 → 6575.28] let's see it's not it's not Windows 10 signed in its Windows 10 with your pc settings shared yeah
[6575.28 → 6579.92] yeah, yeah so what we talked about like synchronizing all your crap I'm just saying it's its more than
[6579.92 → 6589.44] signed in yeah okay live okay here we go here come the results oh for crying out loud uh I will find a
[6589.44 → 6595.44] way to do this hey look at that oh my god ah good software Microsoft what is happening right now we
[6595.44 → 6600.80] need to get power toys on that laptop for you yeah probably yeah most people are we've got 70 of the
[6600.80 → 6604.96] vote right now on Windows 11. yeah, they're just like okay forget it I'll do it so I mean this is
[6604.96 → 6610.64] how this is how they eventually get you I mean I remember Windows 10 raw dog for me, I suspect the
[6610.64 → 6618.88] Windows 10 raw dog people are like me, you have problems would you actually you'd go no security
[6618.88 → 6623.20] updates oh yeah instead of going to Windows 11. And then when Windows 12 comes out because it's the
[6623.20 → 6628.80] next one after the one that's missed it's going to be even more identified dude there's no way that
[6628.80 → 6634.48] Windows 12 is actually good I'm using windows I'm using Windows 11 on this computer and my workstation and
[6634.48 → 6638.56] maybe I don't hate it as much because when it first came out I didn't know how to neuter it and
[6638.56 → 6646.24] now I know how to neuter it and so now it's okay are you going to access the Windows updates despite
[6649.04 → 6654.16] not supposedly being able to is that your plan are you actually just going no security my dad still uses
[6654.16 → 6663.36] Windows 7. like why because he doesn't like the new ones, but it doesn't matter though I don't like
[6663.36 → 6668.64] Windows 11 very much I mean he doesn't like Windows 10. I keep telling him do Windows 10. Here's my
[6668.64 → 6674.08] question though like i I recently did a switch to mac challenge and for the first couple of days I hated
[6674.08 → 6681.12] my life, and then it just didn't matter like I don't use my operating system Windows 10 is in my opinion
[6681.12 → 6688.16] the most it doesn't matter operating system Microsoft has made sure but like it just doesn't matter at
[6688.16 → 6693.84] any point it'd be just any of them they just I don't know man they just they don't really matter
[6693.84 → 6700.32] that much I even try new features yeah and they just in my opinion aren't very good so then i just
[6700.32 → 6705.52] don't use them so I just don't really use the Microsoft stuff that comes from the operating system
[6705.52 → 6710.00] and it's fine like they have this new is it on this one they have this panel when you open the
[6710.00 → 6718.32] start menu that is like you can use Microsoft link and link your phone except it like kind of sucks
[6719.68 → 6724.16] you know what maybe part of my thing is that I just have my like ad block built into my brain
[6724.72 → 6729.76] I don't even notice a lot of the annoying things about windows that one was a major change it added a
[6729.76 → 6735.84] whole extra like was this on Windows 10 when it was 11 oh this is on Windows 11 it didn't happen to
[6735.84 → 6741.04] this computer though so like I don't know yeah I don't know why did they make the start menu worse
[6742.08 → 6746.96] I mean yeah, but you can fix that I mean yeah you I mean I learned how to fix everything so now it's
[6746.96 → 6751.52] like okay you could do that in Windows 11 and have security updates that's what I mean that's what I mean
[6751.52 → 6757.92] like so then what Luke's asking is why would you go Windows 10 raw dog I'm surprised you would just be like
[6757.92 → 6762.16] I'll just have no security and if there's no massive Windows 10 vulnerability I don't believe
[6762.16 → 6767.12] it is able to be tackled by roaming the internet bot things I'll just get wrecked I'm surprised by
[6767.12 → 6776.96] that answer Dan hmm, hmm at work no at home good I let my dad use Windows 7
[6782.56 → 6787.04] I'd use Windows XP okay can't you just like if I still could what's the equivalent of like
[6787.04 → 6791.52] window blinds these days like can you just window blinds Windows 11 to Windows 7 and then have him
[6791.52 → 6796.08] not notice like couldn't you just do that no there's a functionality thing like the split
[6796.08 → 6801.60] functionality the split between control panel and like the new settings menu is getting more split in
[6801.60 → 6806.72] Windows 11. there are just some proclivities that I don't particularly like but what does your dad do
[6806.72 → 6810.48] with any of that stuff come on how often does your dad go into the control panel I don't know he
[6810.48 → 6817.84] browses Google Chrome why does he need security updates like we don't care
[6821.04 → 6826.00] is this really a problem for people like do they care that much about security updates yeah uh yeah
[6827.12 → 6832.56] yeah I mean maybe part of it is me being traumatized by like blaster back in the day
[6832.56 → 6839.92] do you remember when you couldn't so much as install Windows XP and make it to the desktop if you
[6839.92 → 6845.60] had like a network an active network connection before your entire computer would just be taken
[6845.60 → 6852.24] over by just bots that are just finding any connected pc on the internet and infecting them
[6852.88 → 6857.20] maybe that's because maybe because the pair of us like lived through that, and we're just like eh
[6858.16 → 6862.96] it's fine we've dealt with this why would that be the takeaway that wasn't fine you couldn't even use
[6862.96 → 6866.80] the computer actually don't because we've always been fine I don't know
[6869.52 → 6876.16] this is like the XY thing all over again I think we should move on I'm going to move on my guess was
[6876.16 → 6881.20] that most people that voted for that category were people that are leaning towards or already in the
[6881.20 → 6888.24] Linux camp that makes sense yeah I would not expect most people to vote for no security updates
[6888.24 → 6893.28] nope no they didn't but like 22 I think it was 22 did yeah it was quite high like
[6896.32 → 6900.64] and I suspect that's people just leaning towards abandoning you shouldn't be me because there's a
[6900.64 → 6907.12] lot of that right now yeah I've been trying to get more and more used to alternatives you shouldn't
[6907.12 → 6912.88] have been working on that an operating system enough to do what me and my father do my father and I do
[6912.88 → 6919.92] yeah like your dad should honestly just use Linux yeah he actually dual builds mint why is he even
[6919.92 → 6926.00] dual boot why why what is how does Windows 7 yeah make sense here some program compatibility
[6927.36 → 6932.56] I mean he could triple boot, or he could run a VM yeah that sounds like effort it's just easier
[6932.56 → 6938.64] to run Windows 7. it doesn't to me, it sounds easier to have a VM no I'm moving on Cloudflare is
[6938.64 → 6945.12] changing the rules of the internet Cloudflare has announced that is now blocking AI crawlers by
[6945.12 → 6953.84] default and is introducing a new pay per crawl model in which AI services can pay content creators
[6953.84 → 6959.36] to allow their content to be crawled Cloudflare infrastructure and services are utilized by
[6959.36 → 6965.36] almost a quarter of the internet and bots and crawling traffic can significantly increase the costs of
[6965.36 → 6971.76] running websites and recent studies have found that more than 50 of internet traffic is AI bot driven
[6971.76 → 6979.44] in 2025 with projections anticipating a rise to 90 by the end of the decade yeah the internet's fake
[6979.44 → 6985.04] what yeah half I've known this for a while I did not know that I did not know it was that high
[6985.04 → 6992.32] yeah that internet theory stuff is like pretty real like half of internet traffic well yeah because
[6992.32 → 6996.16] I'm not even talking about internet traffic I'm talking about internet interaction right now internet
[6996.16 → 7001.52] traffic that's not surprising to me literally at all the internet interaction though if you spend some
[7001.52 → 7011.84] time on like the dumb one letter website um, and you actually like dive into replies and
[7011.84 → 7019.20] actually read stuff it's painful so much of it is fake it's painful crazy even YouTube comments these days
[7019.20 → 7025.20] incredible amount of like back in the day it would be like the bed in his tank or whatever that weird
[7025.20 → 7031.44] thing was yeah uh there's a lot of spam yeahs click my pussy stuff like that yeah lots of that but these
[7031.44 → 7038.64] days there's a ton of bob yeah Bob's tank army Bob's tank army that was it uh there's a ton of fake ones
[7038.64 → 7044.16] now it's weird it's odd watching them get in loops of talking to each other is entertaining too
[7044.16 → 7052.00] it's like oh this like random tweet or whatever has like a billion comments, and we don't know why
[7052.00 → 7055.60] and then you see that there's one comment with a reply to it, and they just keep replying to each
[7055.60 → 7062.24] other for like ever it's like okay Cloudflare says that site publishers will have full control over the
[7062.24 → 7068.24] AI blocking and the paper crawl settings while AI services will be able to choose if they want to pay
[7068.24 → 7074.40] the crawling prices set by the publishers the feature is currently in private beta and Cloudflare
[7074.40 → 7082.00] customers can apply for early access our discussion question then is how do you think leg will utilize
[7082.00 → 7087.76] these new features and go we signed up for the beta we're not in it yet, but we signed up for the beta
[7087.76 → 7092.56] just to kind of see what's going on it's interesting I think there are downsides to things like this
[7092.56 → 7099.20] it's not like search companies aren't going to be aware of who's turning this on um, and it's not
[7099.20 → 7106.00] like search companies wouldn't be able to hurt your search ability um i not only do I think it's possible
[7106.00 → 7111.84] I think it's so likely that it's close to guaranteed that that would happen that's my vibe check right now
[7111.84 → 7117.36] I don't technically know but I really think that would be a thing it'd be very, very easy for them to
[7117.36 → 7124.24] do in regard to impacting page rank however I mean they can't, they can't drank everyone
[7124.24 → 7126.88] and Cloudflare is enabling it by default
[7130.48 → 7132.32] yeah I think there's also like
[7134.40 → 7139.76] oh man I think there are a lot of interesting bits like if you block crawlers on your website
[7139.76 → 7144.88] because you're like you know the three one millionth of a cent that I'm going to get per
[7144.88 → 7150.16] crawler interaction is not worth the money I'd rather people just actually come to my website
[7150.16 → 7157.28] if you do that it also opens up a really weird gambit where people could prop up a website that
[7157.28 → 7165.60] just copies your stuff, and then they allow crawlers to come for a fee whatever else there's a lot of like
[7165.60 → 7173.52] this is I think this is a good route to be very clear, but this is going to start a very weird interact
[7173.52 → 7180.16] Conrad stop uh this is gonna I don't know what he's doing uh this is going to start some really
[7181.20 → 7187.28] some really weird interactions on the internet um of how things work now to be clear I do not think
[7187.28 → 7194.88] this like AI summary no one ever has to click on a website again garbage is a good idea yeah it's not
[7194.88 → 7200.64] sustainable so we need something yeah if this works awesome, but this could have unintended consequences i
[7200.64 → 7206.32] guess is what practically everything has unintended anything can be gamed yes and this will attempt
[7206.32 → 7211.60] to be this will people will attempt to game this and I don't know what's interesting to me, I guess is
[7211.60 → 7218.48] that this might just be too little too late um most of the clean training data is already out there like
[7218.48 → 7227.12] I've heard that companies are basically like guarding they're uncontaminated by you know just AI
[7227.12 → 7234.96] contributions uh actual human generated training data uh which man could have really fascinating
[7234.96 → 7240.64] implications for like the evolution of communication because the way that we communicate with each other
[7240.64 → 7247.12] our slang and our grammar it changes and evolves over time but if we've got these time capsules that
[7247.12 → 7254.72] we used to train AIs and people are effectively using AIs to process information and send it to each other I do
[7254.72 → 7258.96] wonder if there's going to be like a stagnation there you know how right now there's a fairly
[7258.96 → 7265.92] dramatic difference between written word and spoken word I don't know is there I think so oh okay sure
[7266.56 → 7272.00] sure I'll buy it you and I are not very good use cases for this because I think we often just write how we
[7272.00 → 7278.00] talk um but for a lot of people there is an actually pretty substantial gap between how they write and
[7278.00 → 7287.36] how they talk I'm bringing up a text chat okay who's someone I talk to uh nope two X-rated
[7293.12 → 7293.68] um
[7296.16 → 7300.80] okay, okay okay, okay so here's um here's a
[7300.80 → 7307.92] uh yeah no I think i basically just write how I talk, so this is to one of the writers
[7307.92 → 7312.64] off hours I said one attempt it's not a good example I said one attempt but I don't know but
[7312.64 → 7318.16] we're just chatting on in text I know, but it's you're giving an example of another person who is
[7318.16 → 7321.12] through their work highly incentivized to write how they talk I mean
[7321.12 → 7328.24] got it yeah they don't care um
[7329.68 → 7335.44] so I said one attempt adds a ton of scope at a time when we are objectively very busy
[7335.44 → 7340.96] send it away to expert and test can be done in an afternoon uh around with the stomach as a day
[7340.96 → 7345.76] shoot we can hash this out during work hours though hope your evening is good sorry for the slow reply
[7345.76 → 7351.60] be busy today so I guess i i I'm a little bit more point form in text but i I don't know yeah
[7351.60 → 7356.08] pretty similar to what do you mean like how different are you thinking things are it's for
[7356.08 → 7361.04] for a substantial amount of people it's like very different like they'll use you know they'll sometimes
[7361.04 → 7366.08] use different language um someone's saying professional communication yeah, but this happens
[7366.08 → 7371.92] in non-professional settings as well this is like a thing um man who do I talk to non-professionally
[7371.92 → 7380.32] I don't have a social life man I got nothing uh let's see
[7387.60 → 7388.40] okay what do you like
[7391.60 → 7398.40] trying to not use the AI summary at any rate the non the non-contaminated stuff um is basically
[7398.40 → 7404.80] it where I was going with that is the non-contaminated source data for training is pretty much
[7405.52 → 7414.32] um maximized now you kind of can't get uncontaminated new data so I do wonder how much
[7414.32 → 7423.04] this is even going to slow down the actual training of AI models uh probably not at all but this
[7423.04 → 7430.24] could maybe slow down their intake of new information but even then like because there's
[7430.24 → 7435.68] extremely valuable companies currently popping up, and their entire argument is that they have clean
[7435.68 → 7440.88] training data instead of junk training data um and that's off of data that's already out there a
[7440.88 → 7447.28] massive percentage of the internet has been farmed yeah I mean it hasn't just all of it
[7447.28 → 7458.08] that's a tough thing to say but likely probably uh but the one kind of saving grace is if we're
[7458.08 → 7464.08] going to look at sites like house fresh yeah um new products are going to come out sure so like you
[7464.08 → 7470.00] would still need to crawl a site like house fresh if you want to have up-to-date product recommendations
[7470.00 → 7474.80] so for those of you who haven't watched every when show ever house fresh is an air purifier
[7474.80 → 7480.32] or LCT YouTube video um specialist reviewer um, and we collaborated with them recently on some of
[7480.32 → 7487.36] the challenges that they've faced around uh being pressured by air purifier manufacturers to change
[7487.36 → 7495.92] their reviews and also um it's pressure that they're under financially from the decoupling of
[7496.48 → 7501.52] um impressions and clicks that has taken place over the last little while where people are
[7501.52 → 7507.60] um getting the're getting an impression for house fresh, but they're not clicking through to see
[7507.60 → 7513.36] an air purifier review because there's like an AI summary, and they just don't have to so yeah they
[7513.36 → 7522.40] wouldn't be able to get information on new pages but I just wonder if they'll care I mean the ais are
[7522.40 → 7530.08] so inaccurate, and it also starts an arms race yeah we're just kicking off another crawlers versus anti-crawler
[7530.08 → 7537.04] technology I mean if anyone's going to keep out ahead of it at Cloudflare I mean if they can handle
[7537.68 → 7542.88] DDoS on a massive scale the way that they do that's a pretty that's a pretty dedicated bunch
[7542.88 → 7548.08] they're the right team to be in front of it we're not sponsored by Cloudflare have we ever done anything
[7548.08 → 7553.60] with them don't think so oh yeah okay I mean maybe yet yeah we'd be open to I'd be open to it yeah
[7553.60 → 7558.80] I'm open to it, we've been working with them yeah in some capacity or another incredibly long time
[7558.80 → 7565.52] quite a long time uh yeah good luck Cloudflare we're actually rooting for you on this one big
[7565.52 → 7573.44] time yep big time big time oh we have another announcement on the content side for float
[7573.44 → 7579.52] plane I don't know where that was supposed to transition from cool you can check out my 44
[7579.52 → 7586.40] minutes sit down discussion with Baron uh do you want to do you want to bring it up maybe sure okay we
[7588.00 → 7595.20] yeah cool we talk about a lot of things like some high level company stuff like what the's been
[7595.20 → 7600.64] doing so far because viewers don't really see most of what he's doing or what he's done since starting
[7600.64 → 7608.72] two years ago um we also talked about um how after Yvonne met Baron formally she said I have a type which
[7608.72 → 7617.20] was a weird um thing to hear uh it's not our most liked video, but it is our most viewed video by far
[7617.92 → 7623.28] ahead even of the smash champs grand opening video how do we know that do we have a view counter now
[7623.28 → 7629.76] since when we have a ways to no, no it's not there so it's not on there no oh it's a good like dislike
[7629.76 → 7635.76] ratio though people seem to like it yep okay we have ways of getting information well how do we how
[7635.76 → 7640.00] do we know are people is it just does it just seem very viewed because everyone's archiving it because
[7640.00 → 7645.84] they're worried it'll be taken down or like no, no no it's there's our view counts are not accurate
[7645.84 → 7652.08] um because technically everyone's view counts are guesses, and we just haven't invested literally
[7652.08 → 7659.68] anything in guessing accurately, but we guess similarly all the time I see so it's
[7659.68 → 7668.16] comparable to our own stuff yeah oh okay so like we know that you know but like uh yeah the exact
[7668.16 → 7674.48] number that we have is not accurate but unless they're like extremely weird unique
[7674.48 → 7680.56] interactions around this one particular video got it then it's probably accurate that it is high
[7680.56 → 7687.68] you know next week there will be two amazing Linus videos um one is called I spent 24 hours with Linus
[7688.32 → 7695.52] when did that happen it's apparently a fun day in the life of Linus to see what I do on a somewhat
[7695.52 → 7701.52] average day how do I not remember this I thought this was in Taiwan which wouldn't be a somewhat average day
[7701.52 → 7706.24] I don't know when it was uh and the last time we heard about this I pushed back on it because I was
[7706.24 → 7713.52] like there is no way because you didn't like to stay in like 24 hours it's its clickbait I mean they could
[7713.52 → 7718.00] have hidden in my closet I wouldn't have probably noticed yeah that seems to be it's a bit of a problem
[7718.00 → 7725.04] man yeah I know that I don't think it's that um we also have the long-awaited Linus reacts to
[7725.04 → 7729.68] staff describing their first interactions with him that's coming out Monday so if you ever I'm
[7729.68 → 7736.48] really excited about that one if you ever wanted to see what float plane is all about now is the best
[7736.48 → 7743.84] time I don't think so I think so because you can get early access to deals for lime day and amazing
[7743.84 → 7752.64] exclusives at leg.GG yeah all right what do we get left we got some topics to minimize you can donate
[7752.64 → 7758.88] your idle bandwidth yeah what is this to help archive the internet to make sure that the internet
[7758.88 → 7766.96] never forgets yes Redditor you slash the curious bread posted a call-out on the Ltd Subreddit for
[7766.96 → 7774.64] archive team warrior archive team warrior is an is a software set up to run inside a software set up
[7774.64 → 7779.84] to run inside a virtual machine that downloads sites and uploads them for archiving how it works
[7779.84 → 7785.84] according to the curious bread's post is that there's an IRC chat where the internet archive team
[7786.88 → 7792.72] hand selects web pages with an expiration date they set up a list for each project you can select the
[7792.72 → 7798.80] project you want to support from your end it downloads the pages and after each page is done
[7798.80 → 7804.24] it gets sent off to the internet archive and the copy is deleted from your end lightweight
[7804.24 → 7812.56] late on internet usage and big impact that actually sounds very intelligently built I'm not like i
[7812.56 → 7819.76] shouldn't sound like I'm that surprised, but that's like that's smart I like that you get to pick that's
[7819.76 → 7827.04] the that was the big thing for me that's really cool uh there's a link to the archive warrior virtual
[7827.04 → 7832.80] application page which we'll post in the I'm dumping in the float plane chat right now I don't have the
[7832.80 → 7838.00] other chats open yeah we'll ask Dan to do it when he's back Dan just stepped away yep way to go good
[7838.00 → 7845.36] producer, but it's uh wiki.archiveteam.org slash producing PHP slash archive team underscore warrior
[7846.72 → 7854.48] yeah I don't know I just thought that was pretty cool that is really cool yeah I am a little confused
[7854.48 → 7859.60] as to how it saves any bandwidth for them if I download the page and then I upload it to them
[7859.60 → 7871.44] maybe I thought you could explain it to me no I don't actually have an answer for that
[7876.40 → 7880.64] is it just that it's easier to scrape it's saving is it actually the bandwidth that is saving or is it
[7880.64 → 7884.80] the processing I don't know I don't see how it saves any processing either
[7884.80 → 7890.80] well it doesn't have to like to go to those websites and try to grab the data
[7893.12 → 7899.28] but they have to get it from like us, or we'll only use your bandwidth the only thing I can think of
[7899.28 → 7905.28] is that it would be down to it being hard for them yeah distributing it yeah, yeah so it's its just
[7905.28 → 7912.16] distributing the crawling and um and downloading of the assets in here like it says hey the reason for
[7912.16 → 7919.92] this is to save us bandwidth um yeah it looks like it might be a rate limiting thing okay that makes
[7919.92 → 7926.56] a ton of sense yeah sites often block serve rips or rate limiting okay, okay that that makes our notes
[7926.56 → 7933.92] were just uh maybe not 100 maybe a little bit a little bit confused um yeah very cool i I don't know
[7933.92 → 7939.68] I saw this and I was like that seems like a neat project for people to participate in um here's another
[7939.68 → 7945.52] neat project the U.S. House of Representatives has passed the big beautiful bill uh here are some
[7945.52 → 7951.92] rapid fire tech implications tax credits for semiconductor firms that are building capacity in
[7951.92 → 7963.76] the U.S. could rise to 35 percent from 25 percent the 7 500 EV tax credit will be gone by September 30th
[7963.76 → 7968.40] so if you were planning to pick up a new EV that is eligible for that tax credit you are going to want to do
[7968.40 → 7975.44] that pretty quick clean energy tax credits so for like wind and solar projects will be phased out by
[7975.44 → 7982.64] 2027 which it has been speculated could result in higher energy costs in the longer term and this one's
[7982.64 → 7989.36] a bummer 800 megahertz of radio spectrum in about the six gigahertz range um is expected to be auctioned
[7989.36 → 8000.88] off by 2034 which could impact the six gigahertz Wi-Fi range which um is I think going to be a mega downer
[8001.60 → 8007.60] for American friends that's a big yikes I was at um I was at Natalie's during that tech upgrade hey
[8007.60 → 8014.80] thank you for your ideas' no it is not the Riot Games launcher that caused her slow downloads
[8015.44 → 8019.52] yes it appears to download in chunks and then install, but that was not what was happening her
[8019.52 → 8026.00] connection was super slow we could barely even load a web page um and there were so many SSIDs in her
[8026.00 → 8035.12] area there's like 50 that we couldn't do anything and that's on five gigahertz like i I remember the
[8035.12 → 8043.68] transition from 2.4 to 5 gigahertz and what a breath of fresh air it was using fresh unpolluted spectrum
[8043.68 → 8050.96] and six gigahertz is the that of today, and unfortunately it looks like um that may not
[8052.08 → 8057.12] that may not happen anymore I mean we'll see what happens these things do tend to change when there are
[8057.12 → 8062.08] administration changeovers in the U.S. um so good luck everybody
[8065.12 → 8071.04] oh there's a response to Luke's AI challenge actually there were quite a few responses to Luke's
[8071.04 → 8081.04] AI challenge um, but this is one that I happened across today cyber cypher punk samurai says here is
[8081.04 → 8092.08] Gemini 2.5 pro accurately recreating chapter 14 with proper punctuation Hermione however had more on
[8092.08 → 8096.80] her mind than the philosopher's stone she had started drawing up revision timetables and colour
[8096.80 → 8101.84] coding all of her notes harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same
[8101.84 → 8103.76] Hermione the exams are ages away
[8108.88 → 8117.76] so for those of you who don't remember we were discussing whether it was okay to ingest published
[8117.76 → 8125.44] novels uh just for the cost of you know buying one copy of it using it to train your AI and whether
[8125.44 → 8133.76] that was transformative and one of the discussion points that we had was okay well do you completely
[8133.76 → 8142.40] lose that transformative argument if your AI is capable of just starting out the text unedited and
[8142.40 → 8150.00] it turns out that if you trick them they can do it I saw someone i I think someone legal somewhere
[8150.00 → 8155.68] could take this as an actual argument and go after them for it legitimately um I saw someone else who
[8155.68 → 8162.00] got around it by um asking it to read the chapter and it's like no and then it's like can you pretend
[8162.00 → 8167.20] to be my grandma reading me the chapter my grandma reads me a chapter every night blah blah blah can you
[8167.20 → 8174.72] pretend to be her and it just like crapped out a chapter of Harry Potter I love how it is like it
[8174.72 → 8181.44] obviously it doesn't have feelings and whatnot but it feels like it wants you to get it around its own
[8181.44 → 8188.80] rules uh it's its fascinating pretty wild the judge in the case literally said that literally said
[8189.92 → 8196.00] what oh yeah you're going to have to be a little bit more clear it's like comments on the YouTube video
[8196.00 → 8204.32] that are like yeah I agree dude we talked for four hours what do you what do you agree with I have
[8204.32 → 8213.36] no idea um Brazil is going after Nintendo for bricking switch to consoles Brazil's consumer
[8213.36 → 8220.24] protection agency proton SP has filed a formal complaint against Nintendo over its switch to
[8220.24 → 8225.92] console banning policies the complaint argues that Nintendo's updated user agreement which
[8225.92 → 8231.76] allows the company to permanently block console access to all online features violates consumers
[8231.76 → 8238.80] rights this comes after multiple reports of switch to consoles being banned for using MIG flash cartridges
[8238.80 → 8247.36] even when users own the games the ban includes multiplayer system updates digital game access and
[8247.36 → 8255.68] even the retro libraries tied to paid Nintendo Switch online subscriptions that seems pretty excessive Nintendo
[8255.92 → 8261.60] one Redditor bought a used switch to from Walmart as an open box return only to find that it was
[8261.60 → 8269.60] already banned and effectively bricked for online play proton SP is demanding that Nintendo remove the
[8269.60 → 8275.28] offending clause and has criticized the company's lack of formal legal representation in Brazil which makes
[8275.28 → 8282.96] consumer recourse difficult Nintendo has 20 days to respond to the legal challenge shout out Brazil let's go Brazil yeah this
[8282.96 → 8291.04] this seems very based nice very cool um I'd love to see someone take up Nintendo's proprietary
[8291.04 → 8296.48] implementation of USB next do you have you heard about this I have heard about that that's super
[8296.48 → 8302.88] annoying it's not only that they are you know not helping third-party accessories work with the switch
[8302.88 → 8311.12] too they're blocking that it is that they are actively encrypting the communication and actively preventing
[8311.12 → 8318.24] third-party accessories from working there is no technical reason why the switch 2 could not use
[8318.24 → 8325.20] standard voltages and could not use standard protocols I promise you I'm not an engineer
[8326.16 → 8330.88] but what I can tell you is there if apple can do it Nintendo can do it
[8330.88 → 8339.92] yeah unique username says and their doc sucks apparently there is one third-party doc maker
[8339.92 → 8346.56] that works but even they came out and said okay yeah but nothing would prevent Nintendo from changing
[8346.56 → 8353.84] the encryption key with a firmware update so we're not like guaranteeing anything but yeah it works right
[8353.84 → 8359.12] now I don't know how they got it working like they must have they must have a mole in Nintendo or
[8359.12 → 8366.88] something i I have no idea yeah um cool from Brazil though the USB thing like
[8368.48 → 8376.40] I don't know the rule of the law and that you use USB stuff but I feel like it violates the intention
[8376.40 → 8381.52] certainly the spirit of the law yeah that's what I was looking for spirit of the law um and hopefully
[8381.52 → 8386.40] that you can step in on that a little bit because like everyone using the same connector but not being
[8386.40 → 8392.96] able to actually use it because you locked things off defeats the whole purpose um and honestly
[8392.96 → 8397.44] actually just makes things worse in a lot of ways, so hopefully that's not allowed to continue to be
[8397.44 → 8402.80] a thing well and the really goofy part is like on the switch one it was no problem for you to just
[8402.80 → 8408.32] plug the switch one into a wall wart and use it, although apparently it could like to wear it out faster
[8408.32 → 8413.76] or something but then if you took that same wall wart and plugged it into a dock and then tried to use the
[8413.76 → 8421.04] switch on it like wouldn't work it's like yeah can we just not yeah like can we just not that seriously
[8421.04 → 8429.52] yeah why like I know you got to sell 40 ac adapters but are that like
[8431.36 → 8433.04] 80 games not enough
[8433.04 → 8441.52] how much blood do you want from our stones yeah no, no no i was thinking like no that's too
[8441.52 → 8448.40] cheap it's a hundred something yeah no I was converting to yes um oh boy this is interesting
[8449.12 → 8457.20] the supreme court in the U.S. has upheld a Texas law that would require ID to visit
[8457.20 → 8466.96] some websites last Friday in a six to three vote the supreme court upheld a Texas law aimed at blocking
[8466.96 → 8475.28] minors from accessing online adult content which on the face of it sounds like a good thing I don't think
[8475.84 → 8486.48] most minors need to be seeing that kind of content however like many potentially well-intentioned
[8486.48 → 8494.88] policies and legislation this one is full of holes and no not all of them can be filled
[8494.88 → 8497.04] because we can't get to the websites to see it
[8501.44 → 8507.44] the free speech coalition had challenged the Texas law due to worries about the first amendment being
[8507.44 → 8512.72] infringed upon justice Clarence Thomas stated he didn't believe that this restricts adults free
[8512.72 → 8518.32] speech rights saying adults have the right to access speech obscene only to minors but adults
[8518.32 → 8525.28] have no first amendment right to avoid age verification okay even though this is now
[8525.28 → 8529.44] overturning decades of precedent and has the potential to upend access to first amendment
[8529.44 → 8533.12] protected speech on the internet for everyone children and adults alike said Samir Jain vice
[8533.12 → 8538.16] president of policy at the non-profit centre for democracy and technology um yeah
[8538.16 → 8546.24] this is because back in 1996 and 2004 as well as many other times there were rulings that federal
[8546.24 → 8551.28] law at the time said it would be unconstitutional to have restrictive measures on content filtering
[8551.92 → 8555.92] several websites that would be required to have this age verification check are simply
[8555.92 → 8560.40] not running in Texas as well as in several other states because they don't want to be the ones
[8560.40 → 8566.72] responsible for holding people's private information like driver's licenses passports and whatever other ID
[8566.72 → 8572.48] would be used to verify the user see that's the problem with this law is that I don't want that
[8572.48 → 8580.96] either the government is not doing the work to make it manageable they don't have a nationwide ID
[8580.96 → 8588.32] program for every man woman and child that is properly administered and properly safeguarded and
[8588.32 → 8595.68] whatever and I'm not even advocating for that as a solution here I'm just saying that they are not doing
[8595.68 → 8603.04] the work and not putting in any kind of infrastructure that would enable these organizations to perform the
[8603.04 → 8609.92] identity and age verification checks that they are demanding that they perform they're putting all the
[8609.92 → 8617.44] liability on these private enterprises all of whom are going to have to create from scratch some kind of
[8617.44 → 8631.36] solution to collect this information validates it and store it which is assuming their insane I'm assuming what they're hoping if I can make an if I can try to find an argument for them right now
[8631.36 → 8640.72] I'm assuming what they're hoping is that the free market will make a stripe-like thing where the liability goes on a third-party company
[8640.72 → 8646.80] that is very highly security focused sure I mean that worked great for the credit monitoring industry
[8647.52 → 8652.48] Equifax is awesome TransUnion too I love them both
[8654.08 → 8661.52] dude what I'm kind of TransUnion site is so garbage I had to they had a wrong address in my history
[8661.52 → 8669.20] and i I had to I like went in and tried to change it and once you try to change it oh first it took me like
[8670.32 → 8676.72] four three times on the phone with them to stop my account from just randomly locking when I would try to get into it
[8677.20 → 8682.64] and then we finally managed to get me into the account, and then it's like a separate portal to go and like
[8682.64 → 8688.24] register for a change and then when I went I finally got an email saying that there was an update to my change
[8688.24 → 8692.80] request and then when I tried to log into it the page would error out every time I would try to go
[8692.80 → 8697.04] to it, I still don't know what happened with that but I have never lived in Edmonton
[8699.76 → 8706.48] it's its been a wild saga i yeah I mean i the thing that surprises me the thing that surprises me
[8706.48 → 8713.20] the most is that there wasn't one of these sites already queued up by one of the people trying to push
[8713.20 → 8717.52] for this bill that's the thing that surprises me is that there isn't a solution that already at least
[8717.52 → 8722.80] sort of exists um I don't think they've thought that far ahead there's a there's a fascinating
[8722.80 → 8726.96] point at the end here I think you're giving them too much credit I think this is just classic
[8726.96 → 8734.32] will somebody please think of the children I know but uh as Elijah says at the end of this topic
[8734.32 → 8742.80] I swear this prawn topic comes up every month i we've talked about the Texas one in particular I think
[8742.80 → 8748.96] like three or four times yeah this is crazy I don't have another solution to accomplish the
[8748.96 → 8754.64] thing that they want other than just clicking yes on a website and I don't think there is one i I don't
[8754.64 → 8764.64] think so either but like that's the issue is you're you're supposedly um you know anti-government overreach
[8764.64 → 8772.88] and anti-regulation except when it's convenient um or in this case like inconvenient like there isn't
[8772.88 → 8780.00] even there is no plan there's no concept of a plan for how this could possibly be implemented and look
[8780.00 → 8785.44] I'm not saying that the adult entertainment industry is precious and should be protected at all costs
[8786.24 → 8791.20] at all I'm just saying that if your argument is that they need to do this thing
[8791.20 → 8799.52] and you have literally no idea how you expect them to do it how do you how do you legislate that
[8802.56 → 8807.52] I like I can't think of another example of something this stupid and like if you're yeah because I can
[8807.52 → 8812.16] imagine legislating something where you don't have the answer for it, I can't imagine that being a thing
[8812.16 → 8818.40] in a variety of scenarios but in this scenario the thing that you're trying to tell them to do
[8818.40 → 8825.76] is putting serious security risks on everyone involved well yeah so it's like you, you kind of
[8825.76 → 8834.48] know the only direction that they can go in, and you know that it's bad which seems not good
[8837.68 → 8840.24] yeah i have to wonder what lobbyist is pushing this
[8840.24 → 8844.96] like who is asking for this I don't know
[8847.28 → 8851.84] genuinely unsure Helen Lovejoy that's the only possible thing I can think of who's that
[8852.80 → 8858.64] won't somebody please think of the children oh that's actually yeah that is actually here wow you're
[8858.64 → 8865.76] so informed am I on the Simpsons I'm sure yeah yep yeah pretty, pretty much I mean I haven't seen i
[8865.76 → 8870.32] haven't kind of watched any of the last probably 10 or 15 seasons but you and sir dank pods should
[8870.32 → 8875.52] sit down and chat about the Simpsons there's only eight seasons that's when the show ended um why
[8877.44 → 8882.72] just like full of Simpsons references or what i he used to make like
[8884.96 → 8889.92] oh man what was it even called Simpsons wave is that what it's called is it the music what is
[8889.92 → 8895.92] simpsons wave yeah like dot WAV or like basically come up with this I have no idea
[8895.92 → 8902.16] who invented Simpsons wave of dank mas dank miss that was it wasn't it oh dank pods
[8904.24 → 8910.40] isn't dank isn't that's what I said earlier yeah yeah I thought you said dms no, no no, no oh
[8911.36 → 8915.84] okay, okay okay, okay oh yeah yeah no, no I know but I know about dank pods and loving the
[8915.84 → 8919.84] simpsons or whatever okay what are we what are we looking at here that's right okay
[8920.96 → 8927.28] yep that's a thing that exists oh this is like this is peak stuff don't knock it till you try
[8927.28 → 8936.56] it no i yeah I okay yep that's good this is like the good part of humanity if is is all this news in
[8936.56 → 8944.40] the wand show makes you feel bad about being alive any stuff like dank miss okay should restore some of it
[8944.40 → 8953.52] it i am fully unironic the art brain that that man has is amazing i he's he's great that's good
[8953.52 → 8963.52] stuff crump with me Linus um deeply uncomfortable apple has introduced tiered commission and tax
[8963.52 → 8970.24] for app developers in response to the EU ruling that apple must allow app developers to use all
[8970.24 → 8975.76] alternate payment solutions apple has made changes to the store services fee paid by app developers
[8975.76 → 8981.92] in the EU the fee is now broken into two tiers and if you elect to link to outside payment options
[8982.80 → 8990.72] you are locked to tier one which gets only a subset of store services so tier one five percent commission
[8990.72 → 8999.84] on in-app purchases limited store services with the TLDR being no automatic updates no search boosts
[9000.48 → 9008.88] no personalized recommendations no editorial features no custom product pages no insights and analytics
[9010.56 → 9017.28] at tier two you must exclusively use apple's payment system 13 commission on in-app purchases
[9017.28 → 9023.76] and you get the complete set of store services in addition apple is rolling out a new fee the core
[9023.76 → 9030.08] technology commission which allows apple to take a five percent bonus on outside purchases made through
[9030.08 → 9038.80] app store apps at the time of writing the EU commission is yet to respond but if you thought epic
[9038.80 → 9046.88] CEO Tim Sweeney would say something you're right he weighed in on x twitter saying apple's new digital
[9046.88 → 9052.56] markets act malicious compliance scheme is blatantly unlawful in both Europe and the United States
[9052.56 → 9059.92] and makes a mockery of fair competition in digital markets thanks Tim I feel like I always have to
[9059.92 → 9068.32] disclaim this I don't agree with Mr Tim Sweeney on everything but boy do I ever agree with him on basic
[9068.32 → 9079.68] logic when it comes to monopolistic behaviour in online marketplaces um I feel like he has been a voice of
[9079.68 → 9088.72] fresh air just kind of saying what should be obvious to everyone that the emperor has been naked for years
[9088.72 → 9096.32] and if what Microsoft was doing in the 90s and early 2000s was antitrust this is like this is like
[9096.96 → 9106.40] uncle trust like this is you got to be kidding me yeah okay uncle trust yeah, yeah like antitrust but
[9106.40 → 9113.44] like stronger oh like could probably beat antitrust in an arm wrestle die earlier though probably sure
[9113.44 → 9120.72] probably sometimes questionable on holidays heart condition yeah Facebook is training meta AI with
[9120.72 → 9122.00] your unpublished photos
[9125.76 → 9131.52] last week tech crunch reported that some Facebook users are seeing a pop-up when posting to stories
[9131.52 → 9137.84] asking if the user would like to opt into cloud processing the pop-up explains that by allowing this
[9137.84 → 9145.44] option Facebook will generate new ideas from your camera roll like collages recaps AI nestlings or photo
[9145.44 → 9151.04] themes for this feature to work Facebook will upload media from your camera roll to its cloud on an
[9151.04 → 9158.16] ongoing basis according to the terms of service meta will have the right to retain and use any personal
[9158.16 → 9162.00] information that is shared with them wow that's pretty cool
[9162.00 → 9168.16] holy crap how does it keep getting worse Luke
[9172.32 → 9173.92] billions and billions of dollars
[9179.04 → 9179.20] hmm
[9181.12 → 9182.64] I think that's a legitimate answer
[9184.00 → 9187.28] when is it enough like when does Mark Zuckerberg own enough of Hawaii
[9187.28 → 9196.32] never I genuinely don't think that has a cap he wants all of Hawaii uh i for a for people that
[9196.32 → 9201.68] their brain worked that way in my opinion I think it would be just like is he racist the universe he
[9201.68 → 9202.88] doesn't want Oprah to live there too
[9206.24 → 9208.16] it's a valid question I think it's
[9208.80 → 9211.92] everyone why does he want Hawaii to have only white people
[9211.92 → 9218.00] specifically himself actually Asian too yeah I'm sure his wife would be allowed to be there yeah
[9218.00 → 9219.12] yeah yeah
[9220.80 → 9222.16] why does he feel that way don't know
[9223.60 → 9227.04] is it just how he is are all lizards just racist
[9228.48 → 9231.68] if I say that does that make me racist against lizards it might
[9231.68 → 9233.28] they just want to be warm
[9233.28 → 9241.20] species
[9241.92 → 9244.72] oh that's pretty good
[9245.44 → 9245.68] um
[9249.68 → 9253.60] mystery ion says you don't have to be racist to not want Oprah near you
[9254.96 → 9261.04] I actually have no idea what her controversies are so I'm going to stay out of that one i I don't care
[9263.76 → 9270.00] yeah okay lets uh probably switch over to after dark maybe we got a few merge messages today
[9270.00 → 9272.32] all right cool let's do that
[9279.28 → 9279.84] oh boy
[9279.84 → 9282.72] uh okay merch messages
[9282.72 → 9288.16] after dark there 's's to hold on there 's's 12 500 people watching live on YouTube
[9288.16 → 9291.76] presumably there are some stragglers who still watch on twitch for some reason
[9291.76 → 9297.28] um there we got like five probably not for long probably thousands more watching on float plane I have
[9297.28 → 9306.48] to ask you this the honest question okay do you guys tune in weekly so that you'll be there the moment my
[9306.48 → 9314.40] career ends is that the idea I think a lot of people used to that's why I arrive every week i think
[9314.40 → 9319.76] there was a period of time when that was like absolutely a very significant part of it um
[9321.36 → 9322.96] yeah so
[9325.12 → 9330.56] i have to I don't know if that's as much of a thing anymore but i I know that was a thing people at the
[9330.56 → 9337.36] company used to watch well now we tell them what we tell people online during the wand show but people
[9337.36 → 9343.20] also watch to be like is there going to be a work to come back to do I have to come to work to Monday
[9343.20 → 9348.80] do I have to come to work Monday do I have to come to work Monday um I came across this on the Subreddit
[9348.80 → 9358.72] recently yeah I've seen this was funny um I had never actually re-watched the clip really I mean
[9358.72 → 9364.96] dude do I really have to like relive dude I thought it was so I watched like so many reactions I thought
[9364.96 → 9381.28] it was so funny I had a great time with this this guy's face
[9381.28 → 9398.48] so i they were very funny so i I watched i i I had to sit through the agonizing it's so
[9398.48 → 9404.80] long it's like it's not actually that long it's like two minutes, but it feels like forever but it
[9404.80 → 9410.16] feels like a lifetime imagine how long that felt for me at the moment
[9415.36 → 9419.36] I'm ragging through my brain like am I even right about this like because there's no way he would
[9419.36 → 9427.60] say that I'm trying to like yeah it's uh like we were actually like the fact that you knew because i
[9427.60 → 9434.48] don't always monitor chat so like oh that wasn't from chat monitoring no, no i know I'm just saying
[9434.48 → 9440.80] I don't always monitor chat so if you hadn't known yeah yeah we would have been like we could
[9440.80 → 9447.28] have made it to the end of that episode and then once we stopped airing back was not an
[9447.28 → 9453.76] option there was no way yeah there was no way yeah just like yeah it was tough you know though i
[9453.76 → 9458.56] actually I look back at that like fairly fondly and i I like watching reactions to it and stuff you
[9458.56 → 9464.08] know what does suck though yeah it's people that'll recognize me in public and be like oh the hard
[9464.08 → 9471.92] art thing that's actually why are you saying this I don't get that that's all ticktock knows us from
[9471.92 → 9476.80] that's what people know me from all my most viewed stuff is that clip
[9478.56 → 9485.04] so like it will genuinely I'll be in an airport and someone will walk up to me with hundreds of
[9485.04 → 9492.64] people walking by and be like oh the hard art thing wow that was crazy I'm like wow I really don't want
[9492.64 → 9500.80] this right now please stop like it happens at conventions it happens at airports what like
[9502.48 → 9506.96] like if it's just us sure, but it's never just us
[9506.96 → 9511.36] I didn't have my face shown
[9514.64 → 9522.32] it's rough man yeah and then like the stuff that comes after luke harder left vernier
[9526.08 → 9529.68] the stuff that comes after it where they're like oh like I can't believe you saved that whatever
[9529.68 → 9535.92] that part is always said at a significantly lower volume yeah than the initial bit you scream that
[9535.92 → 9543.20] first bit yeah, yeah like it actually happens a lot it's very disturbing I don't know when people are
[9543.20 → 9549.68] just going to yell hard r at me, it's the guy it's a hard r guy public yeah as long as you're not in the
[9549.68 → 9557.60] states you're probably okay it's not like in terms of people understanding it yeah yeah but like in America
[9557.60 → 9563.44] if I was just like hanging around and someone referred to me like that real loud i probably
[9563.44 → 9568.16] wouldn't be stoked on it no it's not comfortable yeah like at all
[9571.92 → 9580.00] yeah i uh yeah it is hilarious though I do like anytime anyone links me a like uh somebody reacting
[9580.00 → 9586.00] to it or talking about it whatever i I love it I thought moist Charlie's moist critical his was
[9586.00 → 9592.00] hilarious highlight of my career yeah did you ever watch that one I got to mike Wachowski it just no
[9592.00 → 9598.24] tiny little postcard of my head it's great to let me see if I can find it can't be that
[9598.24 → 9604.96] yeah Linus tactics almost ruined his career he was like hours it was really fast he was really I mean
[9604.96 → 9611.68] he just normally is really fast oh yeah but yeah this one was so funny uh he talks about how he was what
[9611.68 → 9615.12] you should go watch it if you're interested, but he talks about how he's watching he's been apparently
[9615.12 → 9621.68] watching for a long time like just the channel, and he was just like sitting there just like oh no
[9623.28 → 9624.24] it's all over
[9626.88 → 9633.04] I haven't watched it forever but his recount of this was genuinely hilarious um it was also fun to
[9633.04 → 9641.20] hear him say that because i I first saw his channel when I was in university so like Vic university like
[9641.76 → 9646.40] so that was kind of a cool crossover thing but yeah it's very, very funny um
[9648.16 → 9651.60] anyway we're still here yeah for now
[9655.20 → 9657.68] dork here people have tried to cancel us
[9659.20 → 9661.28] he didn't he didn't try to cancel no, no I know yeah
[9661.28 → 9670.56] oh man BRB gonna fall down the reaction rabbit hole it's pretty funny it's yeah i it's pretty good
[9672.32 → 9672.80] all right
[9675.12 → 9686.40] Dan yeah hit me okay hello dynast duke and LAN I just got into hockey recently and I know you nice Linus had
[9686.40 → 9691.12] made a joke about being a fan of the oilers before but what are your favourite teams let's go kraken for
[9691.12 → 9697.60] me um to me picking my favourite hockey team is like picking my favourite corporation um because they
[9697.60 → 9704.72] literally that's what they are they literally like very literally are corporations so you're just like
[9706.16 → 9712.80] when you buy the merchandise you are supporting you know a lot of the really positive
[9712.80 → 9717.76] things that sports teams do bring to their communities they bring people together they
[9717.76 → 9724.32] often contribute to their communities charitably like um Canuck place uh here in Vancouver does a
[9724.32 → 9732.56] lot of really great work um you are contributing to the livelihoods of not just the players that play on
[9732.56 → 9738.96] the team but also the farm system that filters up to the big league teams um there's a there's a lot of
[9738.96 → 9744.64] you're contributing to the businesses that rely on you know people leaving the stadium after the game
[9744.64 → 9751.44] to go get dinner or drinks or whatever it is there there are a lot of really positive things about sports
[9751.44 → 9761.20] ball um, but you are also funnelling money into the pockets of multi zillionaire owners, and you're doing
[9761.20 → 9768.00] that at a greater rate than you are probably any of the other things um and so for me
[9768.00 → 9777.52] um I really enjoy the sport I am a fan of hockey I love the tension I love the incredible talent of
[9777.52 → 9788.88] um just amazing players um i i i i i I love the speed of the game the intensity i i I can
[9788.88 → 9797.76] appreciate the talent and the hard work and dedication that goes into being so very good at it um but I have
[9797.76 → 9805.12] a real hard time being that invested in a team so for me a big part of the joy of watching hockey is
[9805.68 → 9810.00] watching you know with someone who's really passionate about someone so I'm at a point now
[9810.00 → 9816.24] where I can kind of cheer for whatever team so I just get behind whatever whoever David Gautier wants to
[9816.24 → 9823.76] win it was genuinely more fun watching the finals because he was there oh yeah David's so passionate and
[9823.76 → 9829.60] he's very well-informed not just about the game itself but like all the players and their
[9829.60 → 9835.52] like history and like you know whether they're you know dirty players or whether they're
[9835.52 → 9840.32] people that we can feel good about cheering for him like rant about that one guy was I don't
[9840.32 → 9845.20] remember his name but it was cool i yeah I have no interest in watching on my own i
[9845.20 → 9855.52] i absolutely I don't generally like TV shows I love shorty um and that's like about a hockey team
[9856.72 → 9865.04] so that's cool i I've been considering trying to like recruit a couple of people to also do this with me
[9865.04 → 9871.28] because I'm not interested in just doing it by myself but the like kind of local hockey team trying
[9871.28 → 9875.68] to get season tickets for that some year and like actually trying to go to every game I think could
[9875.68 → 9884.08] be kind of fun um by local hockey team I do not mean the Canucks um yeah i also I really like you
[9884.08 → 9890.24] know interesting storylines like I was uh i I was rooting for the oilers because I don't know they're
[9890.24 → 9897.60] the Canadian team or something uh last year and I was also pretty happy to see Paul Maurice lift the cup
[9897.60 → 9906.16] uh this was the very unfortunate record that he had last year until he won he had the most wins
[9906.96 → 9914.24] of a NHL coach without having a cup just like you could be like the greatest coach that never
[9914.24 → 9920.24] actually lifted the winningest without championship coach is not the thing that you want to go down for
[9920.24 → 9925.68] no it really isn't yeah so i you know felt pretty good for you know for him for finally getting there
[9925.68 → 9932.88] um and this year i just i really you know you saw all the passion from you know dry sidle and McDaid i
[9932.88 → 9936.56] really wanted to see them lift it they couldn't get it done maybe next year we'll have to see how the
[9936.56 → 9943.36] offseason goes um yeah I love the game don't love the corporateness of it I stopped following super
[9943.36 → 9949.76] hard uh back in the I forget which lockout there was a lockout, and it was basically like I was
[9949.76 → 9955.68] just as a fan I was just kind of tired of like millionaires versus billionaires this crashed
[9955.68 → 9960.00] out a lot of people that I know from watching and I just didn't care who was right anymore at that
[9960.00 → 9966.80] point yeah um I was just not interested anymore was it 2011 I don't remember exactly but i I know i
[9966.80 → 9971.76] used to know quite a few people that would watch and like almost all of them stopped watching after
[9971.76 → 9979.44] that to be honest just 2012 2013 was the lockout it cancelled many of the games of the 2012
[9979.44 → 9983.68] season including the all-star game and shortened the regular season to just 48 games what was that
[9983.68 → 9989.84] tournament they did this year that was incredibly okay that was like peak sports new answer the um
[9989.84 → 9999.44] four nations face off um whoa dude that was like that was it's amazing how much harder the players play
[9999.44 → 10006.48] yeah with their country flag on their chest versus some corporate logo, and it really shows us what
[10006.48 → 10014.08] we're missing by having hockey as this like corporate behemoth rather than um as like a like an
[10014.08 → 10019.76] international the four nations tournament even if you're not into hockey at all it was a fantastic
[10019.76 → 10027.12] watch it's like the best hockey you can watch, and every player was going for it every time like
[10027.12 → 10033.04] it was kind of crazy that was fascinating that was my favourite hockey thing that's happened
[10033.04 → 10038.72] in like maybe ever yeah I'd love to see them bring that back i I don't know if they're committed for
[10039.28 → 10044.80] next year but I think seeing the success of the format they they they like it, i I'm just I'm just
[10044.80 → 10048.08] worried there's going to be like too many injuries or something, and they're going to shut it down
[10048.08 → 10051.68] right I know that I think they're not doing it next year because it's an Olympic year isn't it
[10051.68 → 10056.24] I think it's a winter Olympic makes sense but if they did it on nonpolemic years that would be cool
[10056.24 → 10063.44] I'd be super into that yeah four nations face off was amazing okay, okay let's see what else we got
[10063.44 → 10070.16] next hello from Tasmania Australia wow hi Linus as you get older do you expect your viewer demographics
[10070.16 → 10076.64] to age with you do you worry about young newbies in the tech field shunning you in your 40s um it's
[10076.64 → 10082.00] something that I've thought about a fair bit actually I mean I think that I've talked extensively
[10082.00 → 10089.60] about what I call the curve which is kind of a natural fizzle out of not just like online you
[10089.60 → 10096.24] know internet famous people but pretty much anyone with cultural relevance like you, you can't keep it
[10096.96 → 10104.32] forever and depending on what kind of space you're in or um you know whether you're uh whether
[10104.32 → 10111.92] you're a man or a woman or what kind of like uh what kind of role people can imagine you in like
[10111.92 → 10119.20] you think about happens a movie star yeah absolutely, absolutely like you get kind of typecast so if I'm
[10119.20 → 10126.72] typecast as like you know the young geeky tech guy and then I grow out of it and I'm like an old guy
[10126.72 → 10133.20] that still talks like this like that's i that probably won't work for people formats change um something
[10133.20 → 10140.24] that I have not really had a know a strong presence in is short form content um there's a
[10140.24 → 10146.32] whole tech talk that occasionally you know clips of me will end up on or whatever else we have some
[10146.32 → 10151.28] of our own content that we upload there but I wouldn't say that we're a dominant force by any stretch
[10151.28 → 10157.68] of the imagination when it comes to short form um you know everything changes nothing ever stays the same
[10157.68 → 10166.72] and um aging out of this career has absolutely been something that I've thought about a lot but what
[10166.72 → 10176.72] we're also seeing is that while I think the audience is aging up with me a fair bit um it's not as bad as
[10176.72 → 10186.48] i kind of always assumed that it was going to be um we're still like heavily skewed in the 18 to 24
[10186.48 → 10199.52] uh 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 ranges which from an advertising standpoint is like ideal um young men with
[10199.52 → 10208.48] disposable income is pretty much your like optimal demographic target um and while we don't have one
[10208.48 → 10216.32] of the most sustainable uh verticals necessarily like financial advice for instance has like crazy CPMs and
[10216.32 → 10222.48] stuff like that there's a tech is really not that great for verticals yeah uh so we don't have that
[10222.48 → 10229.28] going for us like automotive CPMs are apparently much higher uh what we do have is a really stable
[10229.28 → 10235.52] oh go ahead they talk about that there's a big time has a video on like it's been one year since we
[10235.52 → 10240.48] left donut what's it like yeah and they're they actually like it's a very
[10240.48 → 10246.48] much more open video than I think most people would make um and they show one of their
[10246.48 → 10250.72] dashboards at some at one point and show like their kind of CPMs, and they explain how it works
[10250.72 → 10254.08] and they explain how like YouTube takes their cut and all this kind of stuff, and it's its really cool
[10254.08 → 10263.52] actually it's a good video um I would say the there is a bit of a shift occurring um so we are 41.4
[10263.52 → 10275.52] 24 25 to 34 20 35 to 44 and 24 and a half percent 18 to 24 so that is all that remains is like 10
[10276.08 → 10283.04] outside those ranges but I do think that google's doing a better job of filtering out um like garbage
[10283.04 → 10289.52] data so I suspect it's always been a little closer to that, and we are aging up a little bit into 25 to 34
[10289.52 → 10296.00] but I'd say given I'm going to be 39 pretty soon if we're still managing to speak to
[10297.12 → 10304.64] 65 percent an 18 to 34 audience we're actually still doing a pretty okay job and given that we still
[10304.64 → 10311.92] have 30 of our audience 35 and up we also aren't completely losing the more mature audience either
[10312.64 → 10318.64] I think more of that is probably not related to you and I think more of that is probably related to
[10318.64 → 10323.68] our format because we don't cater heavily to short form we do cater to short form Sammy does a great
[10323.68 → 10331.84] job, but we don't cater our primary content is long form which is aging up yeah that's true and I think
[10331.84 → 10339.20] there's just that our focus is computer hardware which I would argue is aging up as well I don't
[10339.20 → 10344.40] necessarily think it's super related to you personally and there's uh and there's like
[10344.40 → 10352.00] socio-economic factors that are contributing to this like it is harder for uh you know a 17 year
[10352.00 → 10359.60] old to buy a brand-new gaming computer today than it was when I was a kid yeah um not just in terms of
[10359.60 → 10365.52] like raw dollars like in terms of purchasing power and typical disposable income it's much more difficult
[10365.52 → 10373.52] um so I can totally understand why a lot more younger people would gravitate towards console gaming for
[10373.52 → 10383.84] instance okay up next finished all medical training now leaving the incredible friends I went through
[10383.84 → 10390.40] hell with over the past five years, and it sucks what's the hardest goodbye you've had to say and how did you
[10390.40 → 10400.24] handle it oh the hardest goodbye are we're not talking deaths right oh I think I don't think so oh really
[10401.36 → 10406.48] no they left school I think that's probably a little they're all going their own ways it's a little too
[10406.48 → 10414.80] far um man I don't know if I've I don't know about the hardest goodbyes I've had I've had a few moderately
[10414.80 → 10424.40] difficult goodbyes like when I did my uh when I did my six-year exchange um to Quebec not only was I
[10424.40 → 10430.08] saying goodbye to all the people who effectively like taught me French and I spent every day with
[10430.08 → 10437.28] while I was there uh as like a summer camp counsellor but I like i literally i think like the terms
[10437.28 → 10441.76] of the exchange like there was no personal information to be exchanged or something like
[10441.76 → 10448.80] I was literally saying goodbye forever um so that was like kind of weird an old school problem like
[10448.80 → 10456.64] I hadn't really I hadn't really like encountered that before um I don't think I had a super strong
[10456.64 → 10463.52] attachment to anyone in high school anyone that I like didn't you know maintain an attachment with
[10463.52 → 10467.68] yeah like there it wasn't really like goodbye it was more just like fade away that's one of the issues
[10467.68 → 10471.76] I'm having is a lot of the situations that I have left like what about your teams
[10473.84 → 10478.96] like you know you went to provincials for like football and hockey and stuff like was there ever
[10478.96 → 10483.92] like a goodbye moment with your teams that you were like I'm never going to see you guys again that you
[10483.92 → 10490.40] it was less in my opinion like those teams because the team you'd go play with for provincials is
[10490.40 → 10495.76] not the team that you would naturally I think is not the team that you would play with throughout the
[10495.76 → 10500.08] season because they would take a like all-star team from all the different oh I didn't know that
[10500.08 → 10505.20] teams in bc for ball hockey that's how it worked interesting um and then and then you'd go travel
[10505.20 → 10511.84] and play wherever um so like that group I was never usually like that tight-knit with that group right
[10511.84 → 10515.84] it was more of the team throughout the season and the team throughout the season even a lot of times
[10515.84 → 10524.48] you'd see the same players kind of year after year and um so it's like a slow roll yeah what did really
[10524.48 → 10533.12] really suck was the very last year because you turn whatever, and then you're not eligible 18
[10533.12 → 10539.84] or whatever it is, and you can't play on those sports teams anymore and the jump to adult teams a lot of
[10539.84 → 10549.92] them don't exist yeah or the vibe is like completely different yeah that makes sense um like football oh yeah
[10549.92 → 10556.00] adults are not going to want to like get injured no like no turns out people do play rugby I didn't
[10556.00 → 10561.60] know about that until like way later um but yeah football not so much of a thing there's like one
[10561.60 → 10567.60] team if I remember correctly, but they were super serious and they really kind of wanted to be this
[10567.60 → 10572.56] is ancient information it could be wrong even from back then uh but they wanted to be kind
[10572.56 → 10577.92] of like the house team for the lions like they were like trying to make it they weren't just playing for fun
[10577.92 → 10583.44] right seriously playing for fun like I like obviously I'm going to give it but like I'm also
[10583.44 → 10588.08] not trying to be a professional football player so like there's a difference yeah between trying as
[10588.08 → 10592.64] hard as you can and trying to be a professional football player there is a difference yeah um so
[10592.64 → 10597.44] like certain sports they just didn't have teams other sports the vibe was completely different like i
[10597.44 → 10604.48] would still like to practice right most adult teams don't practice so you want the like football
[10604.48 → 10609.36] equivalent of like a badminton club like we're running where you can go, and you can do training
[10609.36 → 10614.24] yeah I think so you can like play and compete in like ladder games or whatever but like even if it
[10614.24 → 10620.00] was just the practice I would love that football practice was sick pushing bags around and stuff
[10620.00 → 10625.52] was really fun um and there's even like I've been looking into getting into ice hockey we couldn't do
[10625.52 → 10632.88] ice hockey when I was a kid equipment's too expensive um thanks uh I do pretty well now um so I could I
[10632.88 → 10639.04] thank yourself I could get some hockey equipment if I wanted some hockey equipment um but like I can't
[10639.04 → 10646.64] skate at all yeah like literally at all yeah yeah it's pretty sad it's a problem like I can't skate
[10646.64 → 10654.16] and like your trash yeah so like I'm I can't just go join a team I mean David offered to kind of
[10654.16 → 10660.64] um hold our hands next year I want to do that I'm kind of down I'm totally down okay should we do it yeah
[10663.68 → 10668.24] okay all right we're doing it next season sod avid's got to recover I don't think you guys have
[10668.24 → 10673.68] seen any content yet but his wing is uh pretty busted right now yeah which is not a good sign
[10676.32 → 10681.92] but he's also a unit he's playing he can probably take some damage he's playing a league above what he
[10681.92 → 10687.28] so apparently he can kind of he's allowed to play in a lower league if he's kind of like chaperoning us
[10687.28 → 10692.64] and we suck kind of thing, and he doesn't like balance score too many goals and stuff yeah um so
[10692.64 → 10698.96] he offered we would have to come in at the bottom yeah like I was good at ball hockey and 20 years ago
[10700.00 → 10706.64] I'm a great Rollerblade oh dude I was perfect at rollerblading terrible ice skater when I was 12.
[10706.64 → 10713.92] yeah I have not done that ever since you know those the crosswalk bars no you don't talk can I
[10713.92 → 10718.24] find an image of this okay in the meantime I wanted to address something real quick unique username asks
[10718.24 → 10722.08] how do you mean you couldn't get back in touch like literally forbidden from exchanging contact
[10722.08 → 10729.20] deals I was a minor so I think it was like a thing um and then there was one other thing that I was going to
[10729.20 → 10736.48] answer and I forget what it was oh yeah the hardest goodbyes um probably the hardest ones for me
[10737.04 → 10745.36] were um employee employment terminations um here so like some of the OGs and when I say termination I don't
[10745.36 → 10750.64] mean fired I'm not saying if they quit or were fired that's none of your business um but just like people that
[10751.44 → 10759.12] um because there's some that like you know I'm still in touch with and like you know it's chill like Taryn and i teach not my boss
[10759.12 → 10763.84] Taryn the other Taryn we text once in a while like Brandon came to movie night the other week like
[10763.84 → 10768.56] there's people that I'm still in touch with but we do our best to kind of part on good terms but
[10768.56 → 10774.08] breakups are always complicated and emotional, and sometimes you know they're not going to be on good
[10774.08 → 10780.16] terms, so those goodbyes can be really hard because these are again people that you work with for a long
[10780.16 → 10786.00] time um a lot and sometimes very intensely there's a lot of bonding that takes place it's perfect
[10786.00 → 10795.20] I can't find an image so I have come up with a terrible way you really truly have
[10797.20 → 10802.00] if the goal was terrible you did it and do you step in them
[10803.28 → 10806.80] like a cross there's like one here and there's like one here
[10806.80 → 10815.60] and it's a cross it's not a crosswalk I said the wrong term it's like uh like an in suburbia
[10815.60 → 10821.52] it's like a trail between houses or whatever oh like a pathway that's a pretty good picture of those
[10821.52 → 10827.28] the vehicle blocker thing that's a perfect path yeah, yeah walking path not crosswalk I just said the
[10827.28 → 10834.88] wrong word we're going to put it on the fridge gold star that's a pretty yeah okay so those bars you know
[10834.88 → 10840.08] how there's like a middle bar and then the high bar and then they so when I used to rollerblade
[10840.08 → 10846.16] all the time I would deliver newspapers yeah speed was of the essence and when I was rollerblading but
[10846.16 → 10851.68] not delivering newspapers or if I like had a few to deliver through one of those walkways so I'd like
[10851.68 → 10856.72] leave my big thing of newspapers and just go with a little bit and try to go really fast um I wouldn't
[10856.72 → 10861.28] want to weave around those because they would slow me down so I came up with a way that I could if i
[10861.28 → 10869.44] jumped I could get the middle of my four wheels I could lodge it on the bar and then lift
[10869.44 → 10875.20] myself up a little bit and get the middle of my other foot's four wheels on the top bar and toss myself
[10875.20 → 10883.36] over and just like vault them bloody hell you shouldn't do that so I did that every week for years, and it was
[10883.36 → 10888.40] awesome don't try it again my brother and I were both like oh no dude I might die
[10888.40 → 10895.92] my brother and I were both very good uh yeah it was awesome and then I haven't done that genuinely
[10895.92 → 10902.88] since I was like a very early teenager good so if I tried I have a feeling if I tried to stop now i
[10902.88 → 10909.52] would biff super hard I literally can't find a picture of that yeah why like is that just so hard
[10909.52 → 10914.64] to search for is that not a thing I don't know okay well anyway I'm sure there's a proper term for it
[10914.64 → 10922.80] all right dan you were not there at the time please don't answer this for Luke and Linus
[10923.92 → 10929.20] uh okay if the company was now still as small as it was five or six years ago do you think people
[10929.20 → 10934.96] would have better opinions of you that's a good question five or six years ago we were a lot smaller
[10934.96 → 10941.60] um I think it'd go a little bit of both ways I think there's a certain amount of inherent
[10941.60 → 10951.12] um I think there's, and it depends on the person like some people will respect someone more the
[10951.12 → 10956.80] bigger their businesses or like whatever um regardless of how good of a person they are
[10957.44 → 10963.28] like you look at the way we hold someone like Steve Jobs in super high regard like the guy's personal
[10963.28 → 10972.56] life was a dumpster fire like he was such an asshole like you know and nobody even disputes it like it's
[10972.56 → 10981.20] not like it's its not like people are like no he didn't completely like mistreat his partner and child
[10981.76 → 10990.88] it's like yeah but apple he did amaze things yeah like it's uh like it's this sort of bazaar issue that
[10990.88 → 10994.96] I've talked about in the past but I think we're doing a really poor job of choosing our male role
[10994.96 → 11001.20] models it's kind of what I think it boils down to um I think we sort of always have fair enough I mean
[11001.20 → 11007.28] we call him Alexander the Great and he literally I don't know if he came up with decimating good but
[11007.28 → 11011.68] he certainly did a fair benefit yeah um yeah anywho
[11011.68 → 11022.96] but on the flip side I think there's people that inherently feel worse about someone the more
[11023.84 → 11032.00] wealth they accumulate which I can also see the perspective of especially now as we're hitting like
[11032.00 → 11040.32] quite a peak of wealth disparity yes and uh we're ramping up into an affordability crisis that is
[11040.32 → 11050.72] impacting almost literally everyone um like on earth um with that said my son lives there have
[11051.68 → 11057.04] sorry tenant have you been had you been following what's been going on with uh property I sent you an
[11057.04 → 11062.00] article today you do I have not oh yeah you should well I mean a little bit but not enough you should
[11062.00 → 11067.20] you should read it let me put it I've been a little busy last few weeks let me put it this way
[11067.20 → 11074.72] um the crash that I've been rooting for some time that I think will help significantly
[11074.72 → 11081.52] alleviate some of the pressure that uh people in the Vancouver area have been feeling we appear to be
[11081.52 → 11087.68] on the precipice like we're we're already over the're already over here, and it seems like it seems
[11087.68 → 11093.12] like the trajectory is this way I'm so excited people keep saying this argument to me and I don't have
[11093.12 → 11098.48] anything substantial to counter it with, but they're they're like oh yeah everybody's just waiting and
[11098.48 → 11103.44] then like when the market drops like a couple percent which is an enormous amount in the housing
[11103.44 → 11110.32] market um they're just all going to rush and buy and my constant gut feeling is like who dude
[11110.32 → 11114.88] corporations who are these people they're going to buy up all the cheap housing because there's a
[11114.88 → 11120.40] demographic shift happening at the same time as dude there are so many businesses for sale on Facebook
[11120.40 → 11131.92] look I buy one with a jet two for one your Facebook marketplace is as i really oh it'll
[11131.92 → 11135.84] never happen, but it'll be so wonderful like if I could just copy your algorithm and put it in mine
[11135.84 → 11140.32] because I would just I want that as its own website yeah I would Linus's Facebook marketplace
[11140.32 → 11144.88] is a website I would go to I know I didn't speak directly to mike you can't hear that but like
[11144.88 → 11154.08] man you see businesses not, not haunted monkey two million dollar jet just an entire business
[11154.08 → 11158.24] do you want to buy a Kroger for 26 000 she's a nacho heater
[11160.64 → 11170.72] like it's actually amazing cursed trade, so there are a lot of businesses okay for sale on Facebook
[11170.72 → 11175.84] because boomers are retiring and there's like literally no one to buy them so they're cheap
[11175.84 → 11182.24] right, so people are able to buy these things for like 1x Evita and like if they have some startup
[11182.24 → 11187.20] capital which is a real challenge because they haven't had an opportunity in their life any money
[11187.20 → 11191.36] so they like to have to inherit it yeah to build up a nest egg or credit worthiness, but you could just
[11191.36 → 11197.44] borrow against your house oh no wait no that's like real though yeah that's how a lot of it's get
[11197.44 → 11204.56] started right so it's uh so it's going to take some time but I think we are, and the problem is that
[11204.56 → 11211.04] heading into this is going to be really painful in other ways like it's going to be a boon to people
[11211.04 → 11217.84] who are who have managed to save, and we're just waiting for things to get ever so slightly more affordable
[11218.40 → 11222.64] but it could also be deeply problematic for people who are a little bit lower
[11222.64 → 11231.52] on the social ladder rungs and have not managed to accumulate the um the down payment that they
[11231.52 → 11236.88] need and whose employment could be impacted by the economic hardship that's going to take place and
[11236.88 → 11244.72] the like everything's oh why is everyone show bad news when show it's almost like it's a reflection of the world
[11244.72 → 11247.76] oh no wait that's worse
[11251.36 → 11255.60] Irish luck asked what is EBITDA um
[11256.72 → 11262.40] and a bit of hold on it's a really fun word that doesn't seem to mean anything it stands for earnings
[11262.40 → 11270.56] before interest taxes depreciation and amortization it basically it tells you how much money a company makes
[11270.56 → 11276.96] um excluding any effects of financing taxes and non-cash accounting practices so it's like uh
[11276.96 → 11285.12] like theoretically a no bullshit like how profitable is this business theoretically yeah big theoretically
[11287.92 → 11295.68] but there's always creative accounting yep hit me Dan hi Linux CBA
[11295.68 → 11302.00] yes do you feel burnt out due to the increased workload as chief vision officer compared to the
[11302.00 → 11307.20] time that you were thinking of retiring do you feel more tired this time well I never get younger
[11308.32 → 11316.24] which it turns out is a challenge because we hit our biological peak man at like what is it like 23
[11316.24 → 11323.20] to 27 or something like that, so everything's downhill every day my reflexes are slower
[11325.68 → 11332.96] oh hi there you know like every day I'm dumber every day my peak physical condition
[11333.84 → 11338.96] erodes a little bit um so I never feel more energized than before
[11340.08 → 11346.16] however I wouldn't say that my workload as CVO is increased it's different um
[11347.60 → 11355.36] I was trying to cut back to four days a week for a long time i never actually really got that day off
[11355.36 → 11359.68] actually I shouldn't say never I think it happened somewhere between three and five times and then
[11359.68 → 11366.32] theoretically um I was going to go to filming like three days a week starting at the beginning of this
[11366.32 → 11373.12] June but in practice um I've actually just started telling people I'm officially back to full-time now
[11373.12 → 11381.20] because I mean the truth is we've been having some very challenging growth pains recently and um
[11381.20 → 11388.08] I don't mean this as a knock against anyone in particular uh what I mean is that it's just very
[11388.08 → 11393.84] difficult scaling a company from uh what's the German word again middle stat yeah something like that
[11393.84 → 11401.68] yeah uh the good one middle stand um very difficult scaling a company from middle stand to even just
[11401.68 → 11408.64] being a sustainable middle stand actually even if we weren't trying to 10x which I don't even think we are
[11408.64 → 11417.84] trying to do um I'd kind of rather not yeah people people people don't people don't want to stick
[11417.84 → 11424.24] around for stagnation right and staying middle stand forever might appeal to you or me or someone
[11424.24 → 11428.96] but it might not appeal to you know maybe Dan maybe doesn't Dan doesn't like that maybe that doesn't work
[11428.96 → 11435.60] for you know his career growth progression I'd still ride the bus but just like I applied some amount
[11435.60 → 11440.72] of resistance to us becoming the size we are now I would apply a similar amount of resistance to us
[11440.72 → 11451.28] 10xing 500 would be difficult enough yeah thousand I would hope I was when I was talking 10x I was
[11451.28 → 11455.36] talking revenue I would hope we could 10x revenue without oh I thought you were talking headcount
[11455.36 → 11459.84] because we were talking about the difficulties oh god no I don't know oh yeah 10x probably be 200 I would
[11459.84 → 11466.80] say 200 220 you could probably do that level of revenue depends revenue yeah profit probably not
[11466.80 → 11472.96] let's go yeah 10x revenue we might be able to do like if we really scaled our activities in LTT store
[11473.60 → 11479.76] um and did like way more marketing so we just like go for maximum top line revenue knowing that the
[11479.76 → 11485.20] profitability is going to drop like a rock then yeah something like that could work uh parasol says
[11485.20 → 11490.48] imagine building an air table for a thousand people yeah I read that, and it gave me short-term
[11490.48 → 11498.80] trauma and I'm not even doing if it's going to be identical um there 's's like no change the
[11498.80 → 11505.36] the complexity is in how many types of jobs that's a big problem here as much as it's a hundred jobs
[11505.36 → 11511.28] it's not a hundred people 200 people would still be about the same quantity unless we keep doing more
[11511.28 → 11517.60] and more things which is what this company does so yeah we already did the hard part Linus coin
[11517.60 → 11522.16] we'll have a system integrator now we're going to have now it's just scope creep, and so we've already
[11522.16 → 11527.84] done the hard part so we're fine okay, okay okay yeah because I was going to say no now it's a thousand jobs
[11528.80 → 11530.64] um I might need another couple months
[11532.32 → 11538.40] uh vacation by the way this is the is the best example I can do nice
[11538.40 → 11544.16] it's that all the zoom you got basically there we go yeah just like that it won't keep it perfect
[11544.64 → 11552.00] yeah that's what he's talking about yeah yeah there you go I can't, i tried every search term i
[11552.00 → 11560.32] could think of um and couldn't find an actual example of it in a walkway like that I could find
[11560.32 → 11565.04] just the bars I found that and I've seen them everywhere they are oh does somebody have a link
[11569.04 → 11573.76] close that's close that's close not it's not perfect that's close yeah no the one Luke showed
[11573.76 → 11580.80] is the one that we have all the all over the place here yeah the cyclist Ender says curious bread yeah
[11580.80 → 11586.80] there are some rough videos there are actually have you seen them no yeah I don't need to see that yeah
[11586.80 → 11595.68] I mean you're not supposed to be riding your bike there it's just a slow-down it's it means slow
[11595.68 → 11601.28] down a lot it means walk your bike the rough videos are usually from where it didn't have them and then
[11601.28 → 11608.88] they put them in because everybody rides looking at the ground well it's a lot of it's like coming
[11608.88 → 11615.36] down a hill or something that's bad should put a ramp and if it's like really gloomy out and raining
[11616.08 → 11620.40] and they're also gray and like the ones that I showed had like little stripes at the top most
[11620.40 → 11624.32] of them don't I have never seen them with any kind of indication that there is something that's gonna
[11624.32 → 11628.72] hurt you that was unique about this one usually they're just gray metal so like in certain conditions
[11628.72 → 11632.72] they're not the easiest thing to see and if you're travelling really fast you can whack them pretty
[11632.72 → 11640.96] hard I never have but i I know from video experience look up staggered barriers I did okay uh last one
[11640.96 → 11646.16] last one I got for you hey Linus Luke and Dan wow somebody actually used normal words for a change
[11646.16 → 11652.56] still awake here in London enjoying the show I am brainstorming an app idea that I want to build
[11652.56 → 11658.48] and I was wondering back at the beginning of float plane how did you plan it out that was my reaction when i
[11658.48 → 11671.12] read this too ah yes plan so Jake and I had a semblance of a plan, and then we talked about it
[11671.12 → 11676.72] somewhere concept of a plan they say yeah we had the idea of having a plan, and we talked about it
[11676.72 → 11684.56] somewhere I don't remember where that was uh it was in a video or wan show or something nice uh and then
[11684.56 → 11692.40] there was a thread made on the forum of people talking about it and AJ who still works here thank
[11692.40 → 11700.80] goodness um responded being like uh neat plan uh, but you could do it this way, and it was like this
[11700.80 → 11708.08] really long write-up of like how we should actually do it, and then we brought him on and did that nice
[11708.08 → 11717.84] nice, and then we're like wow that was one of the worst times in history to make a video platform
[11718.96 → 11724.96] so a lot of it has changed since then but AJ's plan for that time was good nice it's just with hindsight
[11724.96 → 11734.08] it's just like wow those weren't bad ideas but nice rough we'll see you again next week same bad time
[11734.96 → 11737.04] same bad channel
[11738.08 → 11752.08] bye
