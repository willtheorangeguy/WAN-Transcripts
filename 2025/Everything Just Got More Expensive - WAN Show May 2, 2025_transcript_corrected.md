[0.00 → 2.40] Hey.
[2.94 → 3.48] Hi.
[4.08 → 4.56] What's up?
[6.26 → 7.54] Not much, man.
[7.78 → 8.84] Welcome to the WAN show.
[9.40 → 12.22] We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[12.38 → 15.38] We're going to be talking about tariffs.
[16.26 → 17.04] That's right.
[17.76 → 18.72] Prices go up.
[18.76 → 20.54] What? We're talking about tariffs.
[21.36 → 25.32] We must be the only podcast this week discussing tariffs.
[25.32 → 29.46] Yes, and the only podcast hosted by a bunch of white dudes.
[29.46 → 30.64] Discussing tariffs.
[30.64 → 31.42] Discussing tariffs.
[31.54 → 32.62] In their 30s.
[33.10 → 33.54] Wow.
[34.16 → 34.60] Barely.
[35.42 → 36.10] Extremely unique.
[36.36 → 37.22] You've got a little bit.
[37.42 → 38.30] You've got a little bit.
[38.38 → 38.90] Got a little bit.
[38.98 → 40.86] Tariffs will still be here when you're out, but you know.
[41.92 → 45.66] Also, in other news, corporations lied.
[45.96 → 46.28] What?
[47.36 → 48.32] Apple lied.
[48.68 → 50.20] They lied in the Epic case.
[50.32 → 54.36] Actually, the Epic case has gotten a lot more epic over the last little while.
[54.36 → 54.84] It has.
[55.02 → 58.74] I am pretty excited for this because I had a lot of people hating on me
[58.74 → 61.24] for being like, yeah, not a big fan of Tim Sweeney.
[61.86 → 63.14] Not a big fan of Fortnite.
[63.56 → 66.86] But they're like, f***ING obviously right about this.
[67.60 → 73.36] And it turns out, even in America, at least one judge agrees.
[73.76 → 77.44] Things are about to get very, very good for consumers on the App Store.
[77.54 → 78.00] What else we got?
[78.24 → 81.22] Speaking about things getting bad, in my opinion.
[81.48 → 81.84] I don't know.
[81.84 → 84.36] Are we talking about the layoffs or the other layoffs?
[84.54 → 86.34] Or the AI taking over and then layoffs?
[86.66 → 86.90] Next.
[87.16 → 87.78] Try another one.
[88.40 → 89.64] AI getting laid off.
[90.78 → 92.30] It's debatable if that's bad or not.
[92.36 → 92.72] Next one.
[93.12 → 93.86] I don't know.
[94.48 → 97.28] NASA getting defunded by 25%.
[97.28 → 97.34] Oh.
[97.34 → 97.90] Okay.
[99.42 → 102.74] Actually, the biggest NASA fanboy right here.
[104.48 → 105.52] It's so sad.
[105.76 → 106.52] It's so sad.
[106.66 → 110.54] Sir, how would you say you're feeling about NASA being defunded by 25%?
[111.64 → 114.84] Also, they're supposed to go to f***ING Mars somehow with their budget cut.
[115.10 → 115.62] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[115.62 → 121.70] But without the stepping stone mission that was supposed to establish everything they needed to go to Mars, how would you feel?
[122.64 → 124.62] Yeah, I'd love to let you finish, but...
[127.24 → 132.26] I didn't even do a second topic.
[136.26 → 136.70] Oh.
[137.80 → 138.54] My bag.
[140.90 → 141.86] Oh, that's my bag.
[145.62 → 157.30] Oh, the show's brought to you by Messi, Squarespace, Thorax, and of course, our wrap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Del, and our chair partner, Secret Lab.
[157.54 → 159.66] Should we jump right into the headline topic?
[160.88 → 161.20] Yeah.
[161.32 → 162.10] I forget what it is.
[162.20 → 162.90] Ah, yes, tariffs.
[162.90 → 163.22] I don't know.
[163.94 → 167.82] Import loophole closes, and things are about to cost more.
[167.82 → 184.46] You see, I think a lot of people didn't fully grasp the magnitude of the tariffs that are going to be hitting U.S. consumers, and a big part of the reason for that is that a lot of the new tariffs that have been announced don't sound that big.
[184.92 → 186.34] They don't sound like that much.
[186.46 → 188.00] They don't sound like a huge deal.
[188.08 → 189.30] But here's the thing.
[189.30 → 201.00] The big change is not necessarily the amount that the tariffs are, or the categories of products that they're on, or even the source of the goods that are being ta riffed.
[201.08 → 209.00] The big thing that's going to impact consumers in their day-to-day purchases is the elimination of the de minimis exemption.
[209.00 → 214.94] So, the de minimis exemption was, well, I guess exactly what it sounds like.
[214.98 → 220.38] It was an exemption on incoming shipments that were under the threshold of $800.
[220.38 → 239.46] And the idea behind it was that these small shipments, clearly intended for non-commercial use for individual consumers, were not worth the hassle of, you know, dealing with handling all these tiny transactions for all of these incoming shipments,
[239.68 → 245.30] and also, I guess, a way to reduce prices for individual consumers.
[245.30 → 253.30] So, for years now, there's been the ability for sites like Temu, Shein, AliExpress...
[253.88 → 254.34] Is it Temu?
[254.78 → 255.06] Yeah.
[255.42 → 256.74] Oh, I always thought it was Temu.
[256.78 → 257.26] I don't know.
[257.68 → 269.14] Lttstore.com to ship items that otherwise would have already been ta riffed into the United States without them being ta riffed,
[269.14 → 272.52] as long as the total order was under $800.
[272.52 → 276.74] That is gone, I believe.
[277.02 → 278.06] Yeah, May 2nd.
[278.14 → 278.72] May 2nd.
[278.76 → 280.60] So, that is gone today.
[281.10 → 285.66] And it is already resulting in some pretty interesting impacts.
[286.00 → 291.94] Temu has said they will no longer sell imported goods directly to consumers.
[292.62 → 296.52] Instead, there will be locally-based sellers who fulfill the orders.
[296.52 → 304.00] Yeah, this is a B2B2C or business-to-business-to-customer strategy that, like, a lot of people are employing now because of this change.
[304.06 → 307.60] Now, I'm about to say something that's going to sound pretty flippin' wild.
[309.52 → 316.52] Closing exemptions that mostly benefit fast fashion and, like, manufactured e-waste...
[316.52 → 320.64] Maybe not a bad thing?
[321.14 → 322.86] I'm kind of okay with that.
[323.30 → 323.92] I mean...
[323.92 → 326.08] If that's what they mostly benefit, those are things that are bad.
[326.44 → 326.72] So...
[326.72 → 333.20] Well, who they benefit is importers who are basically, you know, burning jet fuel.
[333.26 → 334.18] Drop-shipping garbage.
[334.18 → 349.12] Sending some, like, these small pieces of junk over the ocean, one at a flipping time, rather than consolidating them on container ships, sending them across the ocean that way, and then having them distributed on the other side.
[349.12 → 369.74] However, however, even though I am pretty anti-fast fashion as a whole, like, one of our big core tenets for LTT Store is that when we make a clothing product, when we make an apparel item, it should be made to last.
[369.94 → 373.64] And if, for whatever reason, it doesn't last, there's always the trust-me-bro guarantee.
[373.86 → 377.12] You contact our support, and we will do whatever we can to make it right.
[377.12 → 387.18] And I have always been of kind of the mind that, you know, well, what does it matter if these pants are not the current style?
[387.30 → 389.24] Like, have they fallen off me yet?
[389.30 → 391.08] Well, then I will continue to wear them.
[392.66 → 397.68] But it has become a, I think it's fair to say, growing plague?
[399.94 → 400.84] Yeah, I think so.
[400.86 → 402.94] Is it fair to call fast fashion a growing plague?
[402.94 → 403.36] I think so.
[403.36 → 409.34] Where people are treating clothing as being effectively disposable after a couple of wears.
[409.60 → 418.38] It used to be, like, a couple stores in the mall that weren't necessarily that popular, and now it's, like, massive online sites where it seems like genuinely a lot of people do their shopping.
[418.38 → 427.14] Which has led to a positive feedback loop where sellers are noticing that there's absolutely no benefit to their customer to building something that lasts.
[427.28 → 434.36] So they make cheaper and cheaper stuff, which leads people to have expectations that things should be really cheap because, realistically, it's only going to last a few wears.
[434.36 → 447.50] And so on and so on and so forth until we've spiralled into this mindset, both on the consumer and on the manufacturer side, that all this stuff is basically disposable and is good for, you know, part of one season before it should just be thrown away.
[447.50 → 452.66] And there are ideas for how you can solve the, oh, I'll just donate all of my own clothes.
[452.92 → 466.86] But I don't know if you guys have looked into that in the last five to ten years, but the volume of clothing that exists to be donated vastly exceeds the demand for donated clothing.
[466.86 → 474.30] And as that clothing has gone down in quality, that has become a bigger and bigger problem.
[475.60 → 487.58] So, you know, to some people who are just kind of reflexively against anything that the current U.S. administration does, that might sound like a controversial take.
[487.58 → 497.68] But for me, it is actually, at least on the surface, aligned with something that I think is not necessarily a terrible idea.
[497.88 → 501.78] I do think, okay, so that might be the majority of what it targets.
[502.30 → 503.46] And so it makes sense.
[503.56 → 503.80] Cool.
[503.98 → 507.58] I do think there are things that are going to get cleaved from this that were not under that.
[507.68 → 510.98] So my next words were going to be, with that said.
[510.98 → 521.44] Do you think it would be interesting if something could come through de minimis if it had like a really strong warranty, long duration, strong warranty?
[522.60 → 525.42] I don't know how you'd enforce that because.
[525.46 → 526.38] That sounds tough to enforce.
[526.38 → 531.78] Because, and this is something that I have clashed with our audience about before.
[532.10 → 532.94] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[532.94 → 540.00] Because everyone has a different perspective, which is impacted by the people around you, the place you grew up, what you've experienced, right?
[540.00 → 541.00] Your life experiences.
[541.48 → 549.82] And when I say things like, yeah, a warranty is only worth the paper that it's written on, it comes down to the willingness of that company to honour it.
[549.86 → 551.88] It's because Canada's kind of more like that.
[551.88 → 557.58] There's going to be folks from Australia, for instance, where they have strong consumer protection laws.
[557.70 → 568.36] And they literally like actually have somebody that they can contact that actually has, you know, fangs that can go after these companies and be like, hey, you actually need to refund them or whatever else.
[568.36 → 571.84] So here that functionally doesn't really exist.
[572.22 → 574.44] It's like practically civil court as far as my understanding goes.
[574.44 → 578.22] Yeah, you could maybe try to go to small claims court.
[578.60 → 582.50] You could, basically you're going to end up spending more.
[582.68 → 582.86] Yeah.
[582.98 → 590.64] Maybe not in money, but certainly in your time to try to get anyone to honour a warranty that they just basically don't feel like honouring.
[590.64 → 593.16] So that's the perspective that I'm coming at it with.
[593.28 → 613.08] And with that in mind, I think companies that have absolutely no intention of, in many cases, even existing a year from now or two years from now or five years from now, they'll be like, oh yeah, this M.2 adapter for a full size M.2 in the first gen DOG allay has a one billion years warranty.
[613.08 → 621.96] So yeah, they would just ChatGPT, a warranty, drop-ship, one huge thing worth of stuff, sell it all once it's sold, disappear.
[621.96 → 633.54] So anyway, there are a lot of babies in the bathwater and some of the impacts are going to be felt in the electronics industry.
[633.78 → 641.10] So Microsoft has raised the price of consoles, games and accessories worldwide.
[641.10 → 647.22] The two terabyte series X costs more than a PS5 pro for now.
[647.40 → 655.84] We've actually got a handy dandy little table here where you can see U.S. pricing changes across the board for Microsoft.
[656.16 → 657.22] So let's have a look here.
[657.60 → 661.92] The Xbox Series S 512 has gone from $299 to $379.
[663.96 → 667.48] Series X digital, $100 increase.
[667.48 → 672.58] A two terabyte series X is now $730.
[673.14 → 677.40] It's interesting to me though that if you keep looking, some things didn't change and it's pretty much controllers.
[678.68 → 680.90] I mean, some of the controllers did change too though.
[680.92 → 681.42] Some of the elites.
[681.92 → 683.04] Oh yeah, no, you're right.
[683.14 → 684.18] Most of them didn't change.
[684.18 → 684.74] Special edition, yes.
[684.74 → 688.88] The elite controller series 2 full went up.
[689.00 → 689.94] The core did not.
[690.40 → 692.16] I'm not sure what the difference between this is.
[692.62 → 696.82] So what I will say is because we've had to go through,
[696.82 → 699.66] like because we're not just reading about this in the news,
[699.80 → 702.80] we're living through this with LTT Store,
[703.44 → 711.66] is that the way that things are going to change is not necessarily going to be intuitive to the average consumer
[711.66 → 716.02] because this is a multivariable function here.
[716.02 → 720.94] So for instance, one of the things that happened when we split,
[721.14 → 724.26] oh, so this is one of the big things on our side this week,
[724.68 → 730.34] is LTTStore.com is actually now split into two sites.
[731.50 → 735.38] So global.lttstore.com will take you to a landing page
[735.38 → 740.28] and if you are visiting from the United States, you click the United States one
[740.28 → 743.70] and if you are anywhere else in the world, you go to the global site.
[743.78 → 747.06] So I'm going to open up both of these because we are an excellent,
[747.68 → 750.48] seriously, right click to, oh, I want to open in a new tab.
[750.70 → 755.32] Okay, I, okay, well, hold on.
[755.42 → 756.40] I'm going to figure this out.
[757.36 → 757.76] Global.
[759.18 → 759.46] Okay.
[760.74 → 762.38] Oh, okay.
[762.52 → 762.94] Hold on.
[763.02 → 763.22] We're good.
[763.52 → 763.68] No.
[764.80 → 765.32] It's at the bottom.
[765.96 → 767.54] I know how to navigate the site.
[768.02 → 768.16] There.
[768.96 → 769.16] Okay.
[769.30 → 772.78] So I'm on the global site, and then I'm also on the US site.
[772.86 → 773.08] Perfect.
[773.22 → 773.70] Okay, cool.
[775.68 → 776.54] What was I going to say?
[777.16 → 777.54] Right.
[777.78 → 778.16] Right.
[778.52 → 782.44] So, so some stuff is not going to be particularly intuitive.
[782.70 → 784.48] Let's take t-shirts for instance.
[784.72 → 785.52] I don't know.
[786.92 → 791.50] I don't know if you know this, Luke, but t-shirts, many apparel items,
[791.84 → 794.86] actually have significant tariffs coming into Canada.
[795.32 → 796.28] I didn't know that.
[796.38 → 797.08] Did you know that?
[797.20 → 797.34] No.
[798.02 → 801.88] There's, there are other things like housewares, for instance, we ran into,
[802.18 → 809.18] we actually were, had a complaint issued about LTT store by some jackass
[809.18 → 813.86] furniture store of some sort that was saying that we were, we were,
[813.96 → 818.20] when we were making those CPU pillows, remember those alpaca wool CPU pillows,
[818.38 → 820.96] they complained that we were, that we were dumping.
[820.96 → 821.14] Yeah.
[821.70 → 822.14] Effectively.
[822.14 → 828.04] We were, we were like bringing in these pillows and selling them below cost in
[828.04 → 832.64] order to harm, like throw pillow retailers or something.
[833.16 → 835.00] And, and, and basically they,
[835.00 → 838.84] they accused us of like circumventing some kind of import restriction or
[838.84 → 839.56] something like that.
[839.56 → 841.72] And we're like, bro, this is not furniture, but,
[841.88 → 845.20] but furniture is another one that actually has, has,
[845.20 → 848.50] has some tariffs that, that impact overseas furniture coming into Canada.
[848.82 → 850.96] So what happened with t-shirts?
[851.28 → 855.04] So if you look at, if you look at the two sites here on the global site,
[855.26 → 858.68] our mystery t-shirts are $24.99 Canadian.
[858.98 → 862.58] And on the U S site, where's our t-shirts?
[862.72 → 863.50] I think they are.
[863.60 → 863.74] Yeah.
[863.80 → 865.00] I believe they're $30.
[865.00 → 870.92] So I'll tell you this much on the, whoops, on the Canadian site.
[873.82 → 877.62] These shirts are making significantly less margin.
[877.62 → 880.24] And the only reason that they're priced this way,
[880.24 → 883.56] which is fairly aligned with what they were priced before.
[883.80 → 884.76] So 20 us dollars.
[885.00 → 888.28] The only reason that they're priced this way is that we're trying to go a
[888.28 → 889.94] little bit Costco hot dog on them.
[889.94 → 894.46] Um, we're, we're trying to make the t-shirt like a reasonably priced item on
[894.46 → 894.80] the store.
[894.88 → 899.20] Our cost is now higher on t-shirts because hold on.
[899.28 → 900.66] And this is about to get crazy.
[900.80 → 905.76] The way that it worked before was when we paid duties on the import of t-shirts
[905.76 → 906.98] into Canada before,
[906.98 → 912.68] because so many of them were going to be sold into a region that was duty
[912.68 → 915.00] exempt and didn't have any tariffs.
[915.60 → 919.60] We effectively were subsidizing our Canadian customers.
[919.60 → 920.10] Yeah.
[920.98 → 924.66] With the fact that we weren't going to pay duties on most of it.
[924.72 → 928.18] So we were just absorbing those duties to our Canadian customers.
[928.30 → 932.54] Saying the line subsidizing our Canadian customers is going to make.
[933.32 → 934.10] Well, I can,
[934.18 → 937.04] I'm about to get into how we're going to subsidize people in other regions as
[937.04 → 937.18] well.
[937.24 → 937.52] All right.
[937.60 → 937.96] Don't worry.
[938.04 → 938.68] We're going to get there.
[938.80 → 939.46] So we were,
[939.52 → 942.28] we were subsidizing the price of t-shirts for our Canadian customers,
[942.28 → 946.10] keeping them artificially low because the overall amount of duties that we
[946.10 → 949.26] were paying was actually very low on the total shipment that came in
[949.26 → 951.70] because so much of it was being sold to other regions.
[952.24 → 953.14] Now here's a
[953.24 → 954.08] here's another funny one.
[954.56 → 959.48] Some people have noticed that the shipping prices on the global store have
[959.48 → 959.64] been,
[959.70 → 960.44] are a little higher.
[960.82 → 964.74] And the reason for that is because once again,
[965.22 → 969.80] America was actually subsidizing our shipping rates to the rest of the world.
[969.80 → 971.78] So they were paying maybe an extra,
[971.78 → 972.32] you know,
[972.50 → 977.22] 50 cents and their order volume was so much greater that we could have our
[977.22 → 978.20] shipping rate to,
[978.40 → 978.50] you know,
[978.58 → 980.42] Eastern Canada is about $3 cheaper.
[980.58 → 982.12] And there's going to be people out there that like,
[982.20 → 987.48] don't believe me that are like Linus shipping is like $30 on a $30 mouth pad.
[987.58 → 988.16] I was like,
[988.16 → 988.34] yeah,
[988.44 → 988.60] yeah.
[988.60 → 989.18] Because it is.
[989.86 → 990.76] Cause that's like,
[990.82 → 990.98] like,
[991.02 → 991.38] go ahead,
[991.52 → 991.82] go ahead.
[991.90 → 992.70] Key it into a thing.
[992.84 → 996.86] We don't operate at the kind of volume where we get like way better rates.
[996.98 → 997.68] We can't,
[997.68 → 1000.94] we can't like walk in with our giant dong,
[1001.16 → 1001.54] you know,
[1001.60 → 1002.84] sticking down the
[1003.02 → 1004.48] one of the legs of our pants,
[1004.60 → 1007.34] it just unfortunately isn't effective down to the knee.
[1007.34 → 1007.74] Okay.
[1007.90 → 1008.72] Sticking out there,
[1008.98 → 1010.94] sit down across the table from FedEx,
[1011.52 → 1012.38] men spread and go,
[1012.50 → 1013.84] do you have any idea who I am?
[1014.60 → 1015.02] They're going to be like,
[1015.10 → 1015.30] no.
[1016.76 → 1018.16] Also like keep it in your pants,
[1018.26 → 1018.44] brother.
[1018.92 → 1019.24] Like they,
[1019.24 → 1020.00] they don't care.
[1020.12 → 1021.22] We are nobody.
[1021.34 → 1021.92] You got to answer with,
[1022.02 → 1022.30] I can't,
[1022.36 → 1024.12] we are nothing to them.
[1024.64 → 1025.00] Um,
[1025.68 → 1026.46] so now,
[1026.56 → 1027.14] short is too short.
[1027.26 → 1028.12] Now let's talk about,
[1028.30 → 1030.90] now let's talk about what's going on the U S site.
[1032.14 → 1036.48] Our shirts went up from 20 to 30 U S dollars.
[1037.34 → 1038.56] So do you know why that happened?
[1040.20 → 1040.72] Terrific?
[1041.48 → 1041.96] Um,
[1041.98 → 1046.00] because we decided to lose money on shirts.
[1047.12 → 1052.12] We are literally losing our shirts on printed T-shirts,
[1052.12 → 1053.08] uh,
[1053.18 → 1053.44] which,
[1053.56 → 1056.60] what few we have in stock on the U S site right now.
[1056.70 → 1058.62] So you're going beyond Costco hot dog.
[1058.62 → 1067.32] Because now not only are we not able to claw back the duties that we used to pay on those Canadian shirts that we then,
[1067.34 → 1068.76] like sold into the U S, and we were like,
[1068.80 → 1068.96] Hmm,
[1069.00 → 1070.60] actually these weren't imported into Canada.
[1070.68 → 1071.94] These were imported into the U S,
[1071.94 → 1073.16] but the duty,
[1073.30 → 1078.96] the tariffs that are now due on those shirts make the cost of them that high,
[1079.06 → 1081.00] which is going to be,
[1081.12 → 1081.88] which is,
[1081.98 → 1082.92] which is pretty wild.
[1083.28 → 1083.68] Um,
[1083.68 → 1089.26] so we are actually subsidizing any American who wants to buy a shirt now,
[1089.26 → 1097.32] like keeping them at $30 is effectively taking money that we are making in other regions and trying to keep the shirts,
[1097.32 → 1100.92] somewhat accessible for our American customers.
[1100.92 → 1102.94] I think this plays like directly into the pro tariff,
[1102.94 → 1106.40] like playbook though.
[1107.28 → 1107.72] Yeah.
[1107.80 → 1108.00] I mean,
[1108.00 → 1108.98] maybe because the
[1108.98 → 1111.54] the claim was that they were subsidizing everyone else.
[1112.46 → 1116.64] And now we are using everyone else to subsidize them,
[1116.72 → 1118.76] which is exactly what they wanted.
[1119.42 → 1121.12] I don't know how long we can,
[1121.22 → 1123.32] I don't know how long we can do that though.
[1123.44 → 1123.74] Yeah.
[1124.18 → 1125.34] I don't know how long we can do that.
[1125.38 → 1126.14] So as you can see,
[1126.14 → 1128.20] we already have less selection on the U S store.
[1128.90 → 1129.70] Like this is,
[1129.86 → 1131.16] this is not sustainable.
[1131.44 → 1133.44] Our hope is that this is a
[1133.48 → 1134.24] this is a temporary,
[1134.24 → 1136.08] we believe that even,
[1137.08 → 1139.96] I don't know if people are going to like hearing this,
[1140.06 → 1143.38] but it really sucks having two stores.
[1144.52 → 1144.92] Uh,
[1145.58 → 1147.16] and if all of this goes away,
[1147.28 → 1149.56] it is possible that we could go back to one store.
[1149.56 → 1153.12] I don't know that we necessarily would again.
[1153.34 → 1156.90] I think that it's rough having two stores internally,
[1157.26 → 1158.12] internally,
[1158.12 → 1160.54] the conversation is that,
[1160.60 → 1160.88] you know,
[1160.90 → 1161.68] we want to,
[1161.82 → 1163.78] we want to do a better job of,
[1164.02 → 1164.66] well,
[1164.72 → 1164.96] okay.
[1164.96 → 1167.26] I will add,
[1167.58 → 1169.00] because you might have this context,
[1169.14 → 1169.70] but they don't.
[1169.78 → 1170.78] So I'm going to add this as well.
[1170.94 → 1176.08] There is a way to do better localization within one store.
[1176.80 → 1179.82] So we can have the better localization that people gained from this,
[1179.94 → 1181.16] but have it on one store,
[1181.28 → 1188.58] but we can't do that right now because of weird stuff that's happening.
[1188.94 → 1190.88] So if some of the weird stuff that's happening goes away,
[1190.92 → 1192.72] we could go down to one website,
[1192.84 → 1194.02] but more localized,
[1194.58 → 1195.96] which would be better for everyone.
[1196.10 → 1196.42] Yeah.
[1196.42 → 1196.92] I just,
[1196.92 → 1199.66] I don't know if it's going to be possible to have the same,
[1199.80 → 1200.68] the same pricing,
[1200.90 → 1201.76] just like,
[1201.98 → 1202.60] you know,
[1202.64 → 1203.86] currency adjusted anymore.
[1204.00 → 1204.08] Oh,
[1204.16 → 1204.44] it wouldn't.
[1204.70 → 1204.80] Yeah.
[1204.82 → 1205.08] You can,
[1205.16 → 1208.50] you can set different pricing for different regions and all this kind of stuff.
[1208.62 → 1208.98] Got it.
[1209.12 → 1209.34] There's,
[1209.34 → 1211.86] there are other reasons why the store has to be split in half.
[1211.96 → 1212.94] It's not that interesting,
[1212.94 → 1214.38] so I'm not going to bother to go over it.
[1214.72 → 1215.08] Um,
[1215.34 → 1216.12] but yeah,
[1216.60 → 1217.90] my order history is stuck on the U S store.
[1217.90 → 1219.78] There are casualties with this change.
[1219.88 → 1225.34] This is one of the reasons why it would be nice to use localization options on one store,
[1225.58 → 1227.08] but we just can't,
[1227.08 → 1227.52] um,
[1227.54 → 1227.88] for,
[1228.10 → 1230.10] for a variety of other reasons with stuff that's going on.
[1230.12 → 1231.74] So it is what it is.
[1231.80 → 1232.28] Some stuff,
[1232.36 → 1233.26] there's nothing we can do.
[1233.56 → 1234.00] Uh,
[1234.00 → 1237.06] the precision screwdriver is way more expensive now.
[1237.66 → 1240.20] It's $70 for the bundle of the
[1240.38 → 1241.10] how much was it?
[1241.56 → 1242.32] So the reason,
[1242.44 → 1243.62] and it comes down to,
[1243.68 → 1245.74] it comes down to categorize basically,
[1246.08 → 1246.32] right?
[1246.34 → 1247.40] So on t-shirts,
[1247.54 → 1247.76] right?
[1247.90 → 1248.76] I already explained,
[1248.88 → 1250.56] we're going slim on both sides,
[1250.56 → 1251.52] right?
[1251.56 → 1252.34] And we're trying to,
[1252.44 → 1256.26] we're trying to keep it somewhat accessible so that people can like to order a shirt.
[1256.74 → 1257.18] Um,
[1257.18 → 1258.64] but on something like the screwdriver,
[1259.58 → 1259.98] uh,
[1260.10 → 1260.60] it just,
[1260.74 → 1262.78] or the precision screwdriver specifically,
[1263.28 → 1264.84] it just,
[1264.98 → 1265.90] it is what it is.
[1265.94 → 1266.04] We,
[1266.20 → 1268.44] to maintain the MSRP that we had before,
[1268.44 → 1271.22] we'd be selling it at a loss instead of at a profit.
[1271.22 → 1272.22] And that's,
[1272.22 → 1272.80] and that's,
[1273.04 → 1275.82] that's not an area where we want to Costco hot dog it.
[1275.96 → 1278.30] Like I've always been like that about t-shirts.
[1278.40 → 1281.60] So I think some people are getting a little bit up in arms about,
[1281.96 → 1282.20] you know,
[1282.24 → 1282.52] Oh,
[1282.58 → 1283.52] subsidize this,
[1283.58 → 1283.74] uh,
[1283.74 → 1287.88] sell it a loss that t-shirts have always been something that we've gone kind of slim
[1287.88 → 1288.12] on.
[1288.12 → 1294.28] And I think that's probably why you guys are seeing an outsized impact here because we
[1294.28 → 1295.76] didn't have any room to play with.
[1296.52 → 1296.80] Um,
[1297.32 → 1298.56] like we can't,
[1298.56 → 1299.14] if we were,
[1299.20 → 1299.66] if we were,
[1299.76 → 1301.32] if we were selling into the U S,
[1301.66 → 1302.38] uh,
[1302.38 → 1303.26] at our old price,
[1303.26 → 1305.92] which was 1999 for printed t-shirts,
[1306.06 → 1308.08] shirts that are manufactured overseas,
[1308.08 → 1310.90] but printed here in Canada,
[1310.90 → 1312.20] um,
[1312.28 → 1313.36] we would be losing.
[1313.98 → 1314.46] Yeah.
[1314.50 → 1318.10] Anywhere from like nine to $12 a shirt or something like that.
[1318.12 → 1318.58] USD,
[1318.98 → 1320.88] which is like obviously stupid.
[1321.24 → 1321.40] Yeah.
[1321.48 → 1325.10] And then if we hadn't made any adjustments on the Canadian ones,
[1325.10 → 1326.04] um,
[1326.24 → 1327.04] if we'd gone straight,
[1327.14 → 1327.48] if we are,
[1327.54 → 1327.66] sorry,
[1327.70 → 1329.76] we didn't make any adjustments on the global site.
[1329.82 → 1332.98] We went to 24 99 and that is extremely slim,
[1333.52 → 1334.54] like extremely,
[1334.84 → 1341.26] extremely slim because there's functionally very little clawback now because anything
[1341.26 → 1346.40] that is brought into that inventory pool is destined for a predominantly Canadian
[1346.40 → 1348.40] and to a lesser extent global audience.
[1350.40 → 1350.88] Um,
[1351.30 → 1356.76] so basically the point of going through this was just to kind of talk to you guys about
[1356.76 → 1356.98] how,
[1357.14 → 1358.20] depending on the category,
[1358.20 → 1358.58] like,
[1358.66 → 1361.40] like apparel was impacted in a way that was multifaceted,
[1363.02 → 1363.40] multi-variable,
[1363.40 → 1366.52] multi-variable and any assumptions that,
[1366.52 → 1366.92] you know,
[1367.12 → 1371.56] that companies were making in the past about how the goods are going to flow,
[1371.72 → 1375.06] how the money flows back the other way and what taxes,
[1375.22 → 1376.46] duties and tariffs,
[1376.46 → 1377.40] um,
[1377.44 → 1378.04] are due,
[1378.04 → 1382.88] have functionally been thrown out the window over the last few months.
[1383.30 → 1386.02] And it's possible that I got a couple of details,
[1386.36 → 1386.90] you know,
[1386.94 → 1390.32] a little off on percentages of markup or margins or whatever else.
[1390.50 → 1390.86] Realistically,
[1390.86 → 1394.32] we have a wonderful team that works through this stuff for us.
[1394.88 → 1395.24] Um,
[1395.48 → 1396.22] and you know,
[1396.22 → 1400.64] it's my job is basically to get a high level executive summary and go,
[1401.16 → 1401.36] you know,
[1401.38 → 1401.60] no,
[1401.64 → 1404.16] I want to go more aggressive there or no,
[1404.16 → 1406.28] I really don't think we can absorb that here.
[1406.66 → 1407.06] Um,
[1407.06 → 1407.70] and kind of,
[1407.78 → 1408.02] you know,
[1408.06 → 1409.34] provide my guidance for,
[1409.80 → 1410.10] you know,
[1410.16 → 1412.52] what my tolerance for losses.
[1413.16 → 1413.52] Um,
[1414.02 → 1414.78] you know,
[1414.78 → 1415.32] like if I,
[1415.42 → 1415.58] if,
[1415.70 → 1416.50] if they come to me,
[1416.50 → 1417.56] it's a good thing to have guidance on.
[1417.70 → 1417.72] Well,
[1417.72 → 1417.90] yeah.
[1418.00 → 1418.50] Cause if they,
[1418.68 → 1420.20] because I can tell you right now,
[1420.28 → 1423.32] prices were going to be higher across both stores before I went through the
[1423.32 → 1423.64] spreadsheet.
[1423.90 → 1425.52] I basically went through, and I was like,
[1425.70 → 1425.88] no,
[1425.94 → 1426.10] no,
[1426.16 → 1426.32] no,
[1426.34 → 1426.58] no,
[1426.64 → 1426.80] no,
[1426.80 → 1426.98] no,
[1426.98 → 1427.18] no,
[1427.18 → 1427.50] no,
[1427.88 → 1428.12] no,
[1428.12 → 1428.26] no,
[1428.26 → 1428.54] no,
[1428.54 → 1428.72] no,
[1428.72 → 1428.90] no,
[1428.90 → 1429.30] no,
[1429.30 → 1430.06] lower it.
[1430.74 → 1431.10] Um,
[1431.18 → 1434.10] and margins are going to be pretty slim on both,
[1434.16 → 1434.46] sides.
[1434.70 → 1436.72] So almost across the board.
[1436.98 → 1437.20] It's like,
[1437.26 → 1437.46] we've,
[1437.46 → 1438.62] we've been keeping the key,
[1438.84 → 1439.90] the team strong.
[1440.10 → 1441.40] We haven't been doing layoffs throughout this.
[1441.44 → 1442.36] We're not planning on it.
[1442.48 → 1443.00] All of this stuff.
[1443.06 → 1443.60] We're doing good.
[1443.60 → 1446.44] So that effectively just means he gets less money.
[1446.74 → 1447.14] Well,
[1447.18 → 1447.32] yeah,
[1447.38 → 1448.38] everybody else here is fine.
[1448.72 → 1448.86] Yeah.
[1448.90 → 1449.02] Yeah.
[1449.02 → 1449.12] Yeah.
[1449.12 → 1451.22] So he's just electing to have less money.
[1451.44 → 1451.62] Well,
[1451.64 → 1451.82] yeah,
[1451.82 → 1453.80] just to frame it.
[1453.80 → 1455.16] Because I don't think people got that.
[1455.30 → 1455.80] I don't know.
[1455.94 → 1456.28] I,
[1456.28 → 1457.74] I thought that was pretty clear.
[1458.20 → 1458.80] I just,
[1459.18 → 1460.86] I don't know.
[1461.00 → 1461.90] I'm just making sure.
[1462.34 → 1462.56] Well,
[1462.70 → 1462.98] anyway,
[1462.98 → 1464.10] I'm not trying to over glaze.
[1464.16 → 1464.88] So anyway,
[1465.04 → 1466.38] you know what I,
[1466.62 → 1472.30] what I tried to do when I went through and basically ripped up the proposal that they
[1472.30 → 1477.22] worked on really hard was with a couple of exceptions.
[1477.22 → 1481.14] I think there are a couple of items on the global store that went up like a dollar or
[1481.14 → 1481.44] two,
[1481.44 → 1482.08] uh,
[1482.08 → 1485.72] just because they were going to end up at like a weirdo price point that didn't make
[1485.72 → 1486.22] any sense.
[1486.60 → 1487.02] Um,
[1487.02 → 1488.58] with just a couple of exceptions,
[1488.58 → 1492.70] the pricing on the global store should be pretty much what it was before or a little
[1492.70 → 1493.28] bit less.
[1493.60 → 1495.44] And then on the U S side,
[1495.50 → 1499.18] I tried to keep things as close as I could.
[1500.18 → 1500.62] Um,
[1501.04 → 1502.46] but understood that,
[1502.52 → 1502.78] you know,
[1502.78 → 1505.48] in cases like the retro monitor pet cave,
[1505.48 → 1509.54] it just couldn't possibly make any sense,
[1509.54 → 1510.56] um,
[1510.56 → 1512.40] to sell it at the old price and,
[1512.40 → 1514.20] and be losing like very,
[1514.36 → 1515.82] very substantial amounts of money.
[1515.82 → 1518.76] Here's a gamer question on every sale that I don't know if you want to talk about or
[1518.76 → 1519.04] not.
[1519.04 → 1522.28] How are sales on the U S store now?
[1522.50 → 1522.90] Uh,
[1522.94 → 1523.18] it's,
[1523.28 → 1525.30] it's been 24 hours is,
[1525.30 → 1525.74] 26.
[1525.84 → 1528.46] It's really hard to say for a couple of reasons.
[1528.46 → 1528.86] Uh,
[1528.86 → 1531.50] one of them is that as far as I can tell,
[1531.50 → 1533.30] the report is still combined.
[1533.98 → 1534.54] Isn't it?
[1534.54 → 1534.66] Oh,
[1535.82 → 1536.38] I'm unsure.
[1537.30 → 1537.48] Wait,
[1537.58 → 1537.80] really?
[1538.16 → 1538.72] I don't know.
[1539.20 → 1539.86] Is it not?
[1540.32 → 1541.32] I don't think it would be.
[1541.32 → 1542.52] Is this just one of the stores?
[1542.60 → 1543.08] Because no,
[1543.14 → 1544.40] nobody told me that.
[1545.70 → 1546.12] Which,
[1546.24 → 1546.38] what,
[1546.48 → 1547.64] where are you looking at the report?
[1547.98 → 1548.22] Uh,
[1548.44 → 1548.62] at,
[1548.62 → 1549.38] I don't know.
[1549.44 → 1551.06] Admin.shopify.com.
[1551.26 → 1553.00] I think that's one.
[1553.48 → 1553.88] Yeah.
[1553.90 → 1554.96] This says all channels,
[1555.04 → 1555.26] right?
[1555.80 → 1556.56] So is this just,
[1556.74 → 1557.28] what are the difference?
[1557.74 → 1558.20] I don't know.
[1558.40 → 1559.24] Online store.
[1559.82 → 1560.16] I mean,
[1560.50 → 1562.46] is there a separate Shopify dashboard?
[1562.58 → 1564.08] Is that why I think sales are terrible?
[1564.32 → 1565.60] I could be wrong.
[1565.74 → 1566.72] I don't actually know,
[1566.84 → 1567.88] but I would think so.
[1571.48 → 1571.88] Yeah,
[1571.92 → 1572.10] I know.
[1572.14 → 1573.50] I know about the one for like,
[1573.58 → 1574.62] already saying they're separate.
[1574.80 → 1575.98] They should be separate.
[1576.08 → 1577.56] It would make sense to me that they would be separate.
[1577.56 → 1577.86] Oh,
[1577.90 → 1578.70] for crying out loud.
[1578.80 → 1579.02] Well,
[1579.10 → 1579.40] okay.
[1579.72 → 1580.90] I'll give you two answers.
[1581.08 → 1582.16] If you didn't know that,
[1582.88 → 1585.14] I'm assuming it's pretty okay.
[1585.36 → 1585.60] No,
[1585.72 → 1585.92] no,
[1585.96 → 1586.40] it's not.
[1586.56 → 1586.90] Oh,
[1587.02 → 1587.40] but,
[1587.40 → 1589.28] and even if,
[1589.44 → 1592.48] even if global sales are like about what they typically are,
[1592.48 → 1593.00] uh,
[1593.00 → 1593.50] sales are,
[1593.50 → 1594.22] are terrible,
[1594.22 → 1595.88] over the last couple of days.
[1596.02 → 1596.12] But,
[1596.20 → 1596.32] but,
[1596.32 → 1596.40] but,
[1596.40 → 1596.54] but,
[1596.54 → 1596.68] but,
[1596.68 → 1596.78] but,
[1596.78 → 1596.80] but,
[1596.80 → 1596.82] but,
[1596.82 → 1596.90] but,
[1596.90 → 1596.96] but,
[1596.96 → 1597.02] but,
[1597.02 → 1597.12] but,
[1597.12 → 1597.54] but,
[1597.54 → 1598.04] but,
[1598.04 → 1598.82] but,
[1598.82 → 1599.54] but,
[1599.54 → 1600.42] but,
[1600.42 → 1602.74] I'm not freaking out about that because it's pretty normal to have like a
[1602.74 → 1603.86] a hangover.
[1604.10 → 1604.32] Yeah.
[1604.52 → 1604.80] As,
[1604.92 → 1607.74] as we'd kind of call it when you have like a big sale event.
[1607.74 → 1612.92] And for the last over two weeks, I think, we've been running the Shitstorm sale event.
[1613.62 → 1619.30] And we did, like, I got to thank you guys for your incredible support over the last little while.
[1619.32 → 1626.68] Because we beat our entire Q2 projection in the first three weeks of April.
[1627.06 → 1628.06] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1628.46 → 1634.20] In terms of revenue, it was less profitable because we were eating the shipping on orders over $150.
[1634.20 → 1654.74] But still, like, we are positioned to give ourselves time to kind of breathe, get these two stores launched, reassess, and then take any action that we see fit to make sure that the business stays healthy.
[1654.74 → 1662.88] And that we're doing everything we can to take care of our customers, both, you know, south of the border and throughout the rest of the world.
[1662.88 → 1666.76] Because at the end of the day, right, like, trade war or no trade war.
[1666.86 → 1670.60] Like, I am not personally at war with LTT store customers.
[1673.60 → 1674.00] Right?
[1675.30 → 1676.58] Like, quite the opposite.
[1676.76 → 1678.52] Yeah, like, not even a little bit.
[1678.70 → 1682.52] And I don't think an LTT store customer is, like, at war with me.
[1682.80 → 1683.88] So I think...
[1683.88 → 1684.84] I'm sure there's at least one.
[1684.84 → 1685.96] I mean...
[1685.96 → 1689.92] You're being so unhelpful.
[1691.82 → 1693.34] Just like with the cheese thing.
[1698.34 → 1699.36] It's for the content.
[1699.74 → 1706.50] So, basically, you know, I'd like to think that on both sides we're going to, in good faith, try to, you know, weather this.
[1706.50 → 1713.40] And I'm already seeing some cracks forming in the U.S. administration's, you know, hardline stance on tariffs.
[1713.80 → 1720.74] We're already seeing China potentially rumoured to maybe be thinking about possibly coming to the table and figuring this out.
[1721.08 → 1723.62] So, I'm just...
[1723.62 → 1724.56] All I can really do...
[1724.56 → 1725.28] Like, let's face it.
[1725.36 → 1726.82] Canada is not a global superpower.
[1727.40 → 1727.64] Right?
[1727.64 → 1744.74] So, all I can really do is kind of sit on the sidelines like I do and kind of hope that the big kids are going to figure it out and that mom and dad are going to stop fighting so that ultimately people can get better prices on their fine quality merchandise from LTTstore.com and Boxes.
[1745.48 → 1745.82] Yeah.
[1746.16 → 1749.12] And also disposable crap from Shein and Temu.
[1749.82 → 1750.20] Yeah.
[1750.48 → 1754.54] I mean, I guess that's kind of a bigger conversation, though, right?
[1754.54 → 1758.56] It's like, how would you deal with that?
[1759.30 → 1761.56] What would be your solution, right?
[1761.58 → 1766.02] Because it's easy to say, like, yeah, this is a terrible implementation, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, right?
[1766.02 → 1779.78] But, like, how would you try to change a consumption culture that has leaned so heavily into disability of functionally everything?
[1779.78 → 1790.14] Like, dude, what are you going to buy in a dollar store anymore if there's, you know, 150% tariffs on, you know, literally everything that's in there?
[1790.14 → 1793.36] Like, are you going to go?
[1793.64 → 1810.98] Are you going to, Destiny, Destiny from Smarter Every Day, he made a barbecue scraper that's made in America just as an experiment to see how bloody difficult it is to make a barbecue scraper that is made in America, to make anything in America.
[1810.98 → 1811.06] Yeah.
[1811.64 → 1814.18] I'm just going to bring it up because I forget exactly.
[1814.30 → 1814.62] Here it is.
[1814.68 → 1815.56] The Smarter Scrubber.
[1815.60 → 1815.98] Here it is.
[1817.82 → 1820.70] And what he discovered was that it is flippin' difficult.
[1820.70 → 1821.42] Yeah, here it is.
[1821.48 → 1829.22] For years, I've wanted to make a product, a high-quality product in America, to prove it can be done and compete with overseas manufacturing.
[1829.76 → 1836.10] And I would say it's pretty clear that he is competing with overseas manufacturing in terms of the design and quality.
[1836.78 → 1839.52] What he is not competing with is the price.
[1839.52 → 1850.92] When you have to talk about your barbecue scraper for this long before you scroll down and find a price, I guarantee you that it is not going to be a super attractive price.
[1853.02 → 1857.40] And this is, I mean, this is the same challenge that we ran into to a degree with the screwdriver.
[1857.54 → 1866.96] The screwdriver is a much more complex product, but it's priced $10 more, and that's what happens when you do your moulding in Canada, when you shoot your plastics in Canada.
[1866.96 → 1869.10] You do final assembly and packaging here in Canada.
[1869.52 → 1873.46] It's amazing how fast those things add up.
[1873.52 → 1874.40] And there is good news.
[1874.78 → 1879.84] For anyone who is worried that the pricing of the LTT screwdriver is going to go up in the States, it's not.
[1880.08 → 1889.00] I believe we are either very close to or we have finished getting it certified made in Canada, which we had a pretty good idea that we could do before.
[1889.14 → 1890.70] Just never bothered to go through the work.
[1890.82 → 1891.56] Because it didn't matter.
[1891.56 → 1897.30] We knew how much of the transformative value-added work that we were doing here in Canada.
[1897.82 → 1903.80] But it didn't matter from a cost perspective for our customers, so we weren't going to burn cycles on that.
[1903.80 → 1909.92] But anyway, back to the smarter scrubber.
[1910.46 → 1922.30] Would you buy a barbecue scrubber for $60, knowing that it could very well last a lifetime, and that you'd never have to buy another one, but knowing that you'd be spending $60 for a barbecue scrubber?
[1922.30 → 1924.26] How much is an alternative barbecue scrubber?
[1924.34 → 1926.60] As a person who does not own a barbecue.
[1927.34 → 1928.42] Okay, well, I don't know.
[1928.52 → 1931.12] I am a fellow monitored owner.
[1932.02 → 1932.98] What is going on?
[1932.98 → 1934.26] God, I hate this website.
[1935.64 → 1935.90] Ugh.
[1938.38 → 1938.78] Trash.
[1939.04 → 1942.30] I love these, like, absolutely could be solved by an AI.
[1942.30 → 1943.04] Oh my God.
[1943.04 → 1944.92] But we're farming you for training.
[1947.36 → 1948.76] Little widget things.
[1948.92 → 1949.52] Is it that one?
[1949.60 → 1950.18] Yeah, it's this one.
[1951.00 → 1951.22] Okay.
[1951.94 → 1952.76] Is this like a cup?
[1952.80 → 1953.80] Is this a bowl of noodles?
[1953.98 → 1954.80] Like, what am I even doing?
[1955.00 → 1955.84] It's so good.
[1955.96 → 1957.10] Oh my God, stop.
[1957.40 → 1959.70] Train our AI for access to this website, please.
[1960.06 → 1960.74] Yeah, I know, right?
[1961.78 → 1962.56] Hey, barbecue scrubber.
[1962.56 → 1964.98] The scrub daddy barbecue brush, somebody said.
[1965.66 → 1968.28] One piece portable multifunction outdoor barbecue.
[1968.42 → 1970.54] Well, I wouldn't buy, I'm assuming it has lead or something from there.
[1970.66 → 1971.64] Well, I could, hold on a second.
[1971.64 → 1974.06] I could literally buy 30 of these, though.
[1974.22 → 1981.42] I could buy an actual platoon of one piece portable multifunction outdoor barbecue cleaning tool
[1981.42 → 1984.18] for the price of one smarter scrubber.
[1984.94 → 1986.40] And I'm not saying that you should.
[1987.20 → 1988.74] I'm just saying that you could.
[1990.88 → 1991.32] Yeah.
[1992.60 → 1993.00] Yeah.
[1993.52 → 1997.16] And look, I don't actually need your answer because it doesn't really matter.
[1997.26 → 1997.98] It's not really the point.
[1998.06 → 1999.56] The point is that in general.
[1999.72 → 2000.26] It's a lot.
[2000.26 → 2001.98] But consumers have answered that.
[2001.98 → 2002.54] That's a ton, yeah.
[2002.68 → 2004.24] Over the last 30 years.
[2004.30 → 2006.10] And you'll have the loud people.
[2006.92 → 2010.64] And I tend to like those loud people and prefer to think the way that they do.
[2010.64 → 2016.68] But that'll be like, oh, I'd rather buy fewer things, but buy quality things that I will
[2016.68 → 2018.80] be able to keep for a long period of time or whatever.
[2020.20 → 2021.74] But most people don't do that.
[2021.74 → 2024.88] Cody N7, do you have a source for this?
[2025.06 → 2028.32] He said there was a store owner who kept getting told that people will spend more for Made
[2028.32 → 2029.08] in America products.
[2029.24 → 2033.34] So he went through the process of finding U.S. suppliers, then listed both on the website,
[2033.46 → 2036.10] Made in America and Made in China, with a 10% price delta.
[2036.52 → 2039.04] And almost nobody spent the extra money to buy the U.S. one.
[2039.84 → 2041.04] Do you have a source for that?
[2041.04 → 2045.68] I made it up.
[2046.22 → 2046.84] Yeah, probably.
[2048.28 → 2048.64] Freelancer.
[2049.26 → 2049.40] Oh.
[2050.74 → 2052.92] Athena did a Made in U.S. side-by-side.
[2053.12 → 2055.26] Search Athena shower head tariff.
[2055.76 → 2056.12] You know what?
[2056.20 → 2058.96] I'm going to get you guys to look that up.
[2060.28 → 2060.54] Okay.
[2060.86 → 2064.56] Would you pay 30 times the price for your barbecue scrubber knowing it's safer?
[2064.56 → 2068.20] If I thought the other one had lead in it, yeah.
[2068.28 → 2068.50] No, no.
[2068.60 → 2071.28] I'm like, the little bristles can come out, and they can get in the meat.
[2071.52 → 2073.02] And they can actually be dangerous if ingested.
[2073.56 → 2078.30] I am personally kind of the mind that you have to be kind of not very careful to not
[2078.30 → 2079.36] notice that.
[2079.78 → 2085.30] But I mean, hey, I thought that you could melt regular cheddar cheese from Costco on a
[2085.30 → 2085.54] burger.
[2085.90 → 2087.60] Some things are really hard.
[2087.62 → 2087.94] You can't.
[2088.00 → 2088.62] That's impossible.
[2088.62 → 2090.60] Some things are incredibly difficult.
[2090.96 → 2093.30] And I think you need to understand that.
[2093.48 → 2093.64] Okay.
[2093.80 → 2094.34] That's fair.
[2094.56 → 2095.42] That's fair.
[2095.84 → 2102.12] Just because you have your $700 barbecue scrubber and have never experienced a bristle
[2102.12 → 2107.24] in your life doesn't mean that there aren't others out there on the grind set dealing with
[2107.24 → 2109.46] these problems every day, almost dying.
[2109.94 → 2111.98] CodyN7 says, my memory was incorrect.
[2112.14 → 2114.34] It's almost double the price for Made in America.
[2114.88 → 2115.54] So yeah, I could.
[2115.60 → 2116.64] That makes more sense.
[2116.90 → 2118.10] It was the Athena shower head.
[2118.10 → 2118.46] Okay.
[2118.60 → 2122.44] So that's apparently the one that Cody was referring to.
[2122.72 → 2124.02] And I found the source.
[2124.02 → 2128.26] So we ran an A-B test.
[2128.58 → 2128.72] Wow.
[2128.78 → 2130.62] That's actually fascinating.
[2131.82 → 2133.20] Add to carts Asia.
[2133.40 → 2134.40] Add to carts USA.
[2135.66 → 2136.14] Whoa.
[2138.70 → 2139.92] We tested everything.
[2140.16 → 2141.26] Zero purchases USA.
[2141.26 → 2142.50] Colour, copy, layout.
[2142.50 → 2144.50] We ran it over multiple days in traffic sources.
[2144.66 → 2145.88] Same outcome every time.
[2146.10 → 2148.56] For a moment, we thought we'd made a technical error.
[2148.96 → 2149.56] We hadn't.
[2152.84 → 2154.14] Man, this is a...
[2154.14 → 2158.04] Zero purchases USA is wild.
[2158.04 → 2160.44] That's surprising to me, actually.
[2160.44 → 2164.44] I genuinely would have expected...
[2164.44 → 2165.92] You know what I bet it is?
[2166.24 → 2167.74] I bet it's the product category.
[2168.14 → 2170.48] Because if it was like a gun or something.
[2171.56 → 2171.92] Right?
[2172.00 → 2173.10] Like if it was something that...
[2173.10 → 2174.44] Because it's like a water purifier.
[2175.44 → 2176.46] So they don't care.
[2176.46 → 2177.58] Or is it a shower head or something?
[2177.58 → 2179.60] I think it's a shower head water purifier, isn't it?
[2179.70 → 2180.00] FINA?
[2180.16 → 2180.64] What do they make?
[2181.42 → 2182.30] Filtered shower head.
[2182.40 → 2182.52] Yeah.
[2182.66 → 2182.84] Yeah.
[2182.90 → 2183.10] Okay.
[2183.20 → 2183.90] So it's some...
[2183.90 → 2186.18] It's some filtered shower head.
[2186.28 → 2187.34] It makes my hair nicer.
[2187.54 → 2189.40] That realistically people...
[2189.40 → 2190.14] I don't have a hair.
[2190.34 → 2190.78] Well, no.
[2190.88 → 2191.24] I don't.
[2191.44 → 2191.56] I don't.
[2191.60 → 2192.34] Oh, my God.
[2192.40 → 2192.64] Don't...
[2192.64 → 2193.96] Can you not generalize?
[2194.14 → 2194.28] You can...
[2194.28 → 2196.72] They call it a bald eagle for a reason, Linus.
[2197.38 → 2199.72] We don't actually want to be assimilated.
[2199.88 → 2200.52] Scrawl!
[2201.38 → 2201.78] Annexed.
[2201.90 → 2202.22] Whatever.
[2202.78 → 2203.64] No, I...
[2203.64 → 2206.06] Realistically, I'm saying that they're buying...
[2207.28 → 2208.60] Like, you know...
[2208.60 → 2209.88] Products they think are going to last.
[2209.98 → 2211.64] And standing behind things that are made...
[2211.64 → 2214.34] I'm not against that purchasing style, to be completely honest.
[2214.34 → 2214.56] No, no.
[2214.56 → 2216.06] I'm just saying that I don't think...
[2216.06 → 2216.70] I like it, if anything.
[2216.80 → 2219.16] I don't think there's anything particularly...
[2219.16 → 2222.54] That speaks to the American identity about a shower head.
[2222.54 → 2227.06] Whereas, I think if you were going to make it a barbecue scrubber, I think you'd probably
[2227.06 → 2228.56] get more than zero sales.
[2229.12 → 2230.06] Yes, I do agree.
[2230.14 → 2231.06] Like, you take a...
[2231.06 → 2232.24] You know, it's 4th of July.
[2232.38 → 2235.24] You do a $10 discount on your $60 barbecue scrubber.
[2235.32 → 2237.22] You have a compelling sales pitch behind it.
[2237.26 → 2237.62] It's safer.
[2237.76 → 2238.68] It doesn't have these bristles.
[2238.80 → 2240.40] You put an American flag on the back of it.
[2240.62 → 2242.28] I think you can actually sell a few of those.
[2242.66 → 2248.54] But I think the difference is that this is clearly a commodity item in the eyes of the
[2248.54 → 2249.82] people who were shopping for it.
[2249.82 → 2254.10] And when it comes to a commodity item, I could certainly see people having less brand loyalty.
[2254.42 → 2257.94] I mean, I certainly have less brand loyalty for things I perceive to be a commodity.
[2258.64 → 2260.84] Like, I have been...
[2260.84 → 2266.22] I've spent my entire life completely bewildered by people who have a preference for gas station.
[2267.24 → 2267.82] Like...
[2267.82 → 2269.22] I have a preference for gas station.
[2269.64 → 2270.90] You have a points program.
[2271.16 → 2271.42] Nope.
[2271.86 → 2272.18] Costco.
[2272.54 → 2272.80] Nope.
[2275.32 → 2275.80] Why?
[2275.80 → 2277.08] It's...
[2277.08 → 2278.02] It's just...
[2278.02 → 2279.06] I think they're...
[2279.06 → 2279.72] They're cool.
[2279.90 → 2280.66] It's Clover Hill.
[2280.74 → 2282.50] It's where we sold those berries that one time.
[2282.58 → 2283.08] Oh my god.
[2283.76 → 2284.10] Okay.
[2284.66 → 2285.38] That's different.
[2285.58 → 2288.32] I'm talking about, like, multinational...
[2288.32 → 2289.20] Literally one...
[2289.20 → 2290.56] Chain gas stations.
[2290.72 → 2292.12] You can't even pay at the pump.
[2292.32 → 2294.08] There's a little sign that apologizes for it.
[2294.12 → 2296.12] They're like, the pump upgrade's really expensive.
[2296.32 → 2298.62] So if you could just come pay inside, that would be great.
[2298.62 → 2301.74] So I go pay inside for my gas.
[2302.10 → 2304.88] And they have little, like, homemade muffins that you can buy and stuff.
[2305.50 → 2307.56] And they still sell DVDs.
[2310.64 → 2312.48] And I don't exclusively go there.
[2312.56 → 2313.90] But I like...
[2313.90 → 2314.50] I like...
[2314.50 → 2316.62] It's like Willow Video.
[2317.70 → 2320.34] I like bringing my business to businesses that I think are cool.
[2320.34 → 2320.44] No, no.
[2320.44 → 2321.04] That's totally fine.
[2321.04 → 2323.58] But it's also not what I'm talking about at all.
[2323.62 → 2324.30] And you know it.
[2324.30 → 2329.30] So anywho...
[2329.30 → 2332.34] Like, I can definitely...
[2332.34 → 2336.74] I relate to people not really having a preference when it comes to commodity items.
[2336.74 → 2336.88] Okay.
[2336.94 → 2337.62] So how do you...
[2337.62 → 2338.12] How do you...
[2338.12 → 2338.40] What...
[2338.40 → 2339.00] How do you...
[2339.00 → 2340.54] Because this is an over $100 item.
[2341.68 → 2342.10] No.
[2342.46 → 2342.66] No.
[2342.70 → 2343.44] This is a very cheap item.
[2343.52 → 2344.96] Are we talking about barbecue scrubbers or what?
[2345.08 → 2346.54] Oh, the filters.
[2347.16 → 2347.36] Mm.
[2348.06 → 2348.98] Oh, how much is it?
[2348.98 → 2353.08] The cheap one, the manufactured in Asia one, is $129.
[2353.08 → 2354.86] And the other one's like $250?
[2355.08 → 2357.46] Let me see if I can find it.
[2359.04 → 2365.08] So $129 for Made in Asia and $240 for Made in USA.
[2365.22 → 2365.44] Okay.
[2365.72 → 2366.96] So about double the price.
[2367.20 → 2367.42] Yeah.
[2369.64 → 2370.52] Oh, man.
[2370.64 → 2370.80] Yeah.
[2370.84 → 2372.24] I guess that's another factor too.
[2372.36 → 2376.16] It's not just the percentage difference in price.
[2376.48 → 2379.42] It's the actual raw dollars.
[2379.42 → 2386.20] Like I am paying right now out of my pocket for American labour.
[2386.84 → 2392.14] But realistically, they're people I've never met to have the same shower head.
[2392.30 → 2396.42] Do you think the way that they ran it twisted it at all?
[2396.48 → 2399.14] Because I'm looking at this and I see this one.
[2400.12 → 2401.26] Same design, two options.
[2401.34 → 2402.96] You choose Made in USA or Asian.
[2403.06 → 2404.72] They have a little flag for Made in USA and stuff.
[2404.88 → 2405.52] This may...
[2405.52 → 2406.12] Okay, cool.
[2406.30 → 2408.28] But then you see the actual cart page.
[2408.92 → 2411.90] And Made in USA is the default selection for one.
[2412.44 → 2416.10] For two, it shows $300 slashed out to $129.
[2417.14 → 2418.74] And then there's like...
[2418.74 → 2419.86] Important note.
[2419.96 → 2421.30] The quality is identical regardless...
[2421.30 → 2424.38] This might even be true, but I'm just wondering if it twists things.
[2424.80 → 2427.56] The quality is identical regardless of where the shower head is manufactured.
[2427.70 → 2430.46] While our USA-made shower head is indeed made in the United States,
[2430.46 → 2435.60] some of the materials used are still sourced from other countries as they're not available in the USA.
[2435.96 → 2439.78] And that almost like has to be true when it comes to certain like minerals or whatever else.
[2439.98 → 2440.06] Yeah.
[2440.06 → 2441.18] So that is what it is.
[2441.42 → 2442.86] But I could see that impacting.
[2443.08 → 2443.30] I could...
[2443.30 → 2444.26] Yeah, I could see that impacting.
[2444.44 → 2444.60] Yeah.
[2444.96 → 2445.98] I think that...
[2445.98 → 2451.56] I think that if they were slightly less transparent in the running of their exercise...
[2451.56 → 2452.40] They might have gotten more converts.
[2452.40 → 2455.96] It might have been a less honest presentation,
[2455.96 → 2459.80] but it might have been a better experiment, if that makes sense.
[2459.80 → 2460.00] Maybe.
[2460.28 → 2460.46] Yeah.
[2460.82 → 2467.14] Because most people that I know of that are buying nationally are buying nationally because of quality.
[2468.10 → 2469.04] More than anything.
[2469.38 → 2469.76] Mm-hmm.
[2470.18 → 2475.00] But then do you really have doubts about the raw quality of like a copper tube
[2475.00 → 2478.40] before it was bent into a faucet or whatever it is?
[2478.40 → 2478.58] Some people do.
[2478.72 → 2479.28] Some people do.
[2479.46 → 2481.44] I guarantee you some people do.
[2481.64 → 2482.52] Yeah, but then...
[2482.52 → 2486.76] There's like the whole Chinese steel versus whatever other steel argument.
[2486.86 → 2488.50] I have no idea if that's real or not.
[2488.50 → 2490.24] I know nothing about it, but I've heard those phrases.
[2490.30 → 2493.08] But wouldn't you rather somebody tell you like,
[2493.20 → 2496.76] hey, if anyone else says that they're using American this, they're not.
[2496.92 → 2497.84] It like isn't a thing.
[2499.32 → 2502.54] Like it does seem like the more honest way to present it.
[2502.70 → 2505.16] No, I prefer it being presented this way to be clear.
[2505.24 → 2508.98] I'm just saying I wonder if that changed anything.
[2508.98 → 2513.42] I also think it's interesting that made in Asia is selected by default.
[2514.94 → 2518.14] Well, didn't they say they tried different forms?
[2518.14 → 2519.24] Yeah, but they don't show it.
[2519.44 → 2520.14] Yeah, that's fair.
[2520.34 → 2520.78] That's fair.
[2521.86 → 2522.98] Either way...
[2522.98 → 2523.80] This graph is crazy.
[2523.90 → 2525.24] Sorry, one last one.
[2525.92 → 2527.34] You can't even like to see it.
[2527.34 → 2533.42] It looks like the whole graph is just on the left, but no, there are two more columns here.
[2533.52 → 2535.46] Two separate additional columns right here.
[2535.92 → 2536.32] Yeah.
[2536.42 → 2539.80] One of them is just not actually existent because it's at 0.00.
[2540.44 → 2541.92] But the section is there.
[2543.52 → 2544.14] That's wild.
[2544.26 → 2551.46] Did you see Sony just like increased prices everywhere to subsidize the US?
[2551.58 → 2552.10] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2552.10 → 2553.76] And to pay for the tariffs that way.
[2553.78 → 2554.60] But this is...
[2554.60 → 2558.48] My problem with that is if you're trying to go against it...
[2558.48 → 2559.64] It's a PlayStation wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.
[2559.74 → 2560.02] Yeah.
[2560.90 → 2569.10] If you're trying to go against the whole idea, you're playing into exactly what...
[2569.70 → 2574.22] One of the taglines was at one point in time, which is that America was subsidizing everywhere else.
[2575.76 → 2581.80] And now a lot of companies are flipping that, which is theoretically what they wanted.
[2582.10 → 2582.50] Right.
[2582.66 → 2585.06] So if you're trying to go against it, you're playing into what they wanted.
[2585.24 → 2593.06] Just to make this completely clear, we have not increased prices on our global store to account for tariffs.
[2593.14 → 2594.88] We have increased prices on our US store.
[2595.14 → 2600.32] There is one key difference, and that's something that I talked about on the shipping side,
[2600.44 → 2604.92] where because we were consolidating all of our shipments and routing them through the US,
[2605.36 → 2607.96] our US costs were quite a lot lower,
[2607.96 → 2614.36] but our international costs were a lot higher to the point where we would basically sell nothing internationally before.
[2615.10 → 2622.94] And so, yeah, we did play some games with the shipping costs a little bit to help kind of balance the playing field a little bit.
[2622.98 → 2626.54] And I think maybe that's something that is going to be upsetting to some people.
[2626.80 → 2630.86] And I, again, back to what I was saying earlier about everyone having their different perspectives,
[2630.86 → 2632.28] that's something I'm really used to.
[2632.28 → 2635.14] And so maybe that's something that I kind of dropped casually.
[2635.42 → 2639.76] And for other people, it was like a complete bomb because, like, for instance,
[2640.00 → 2643.70] my first exposure to this concept was when I started working at NCI.
[2644.08 → 2650.20] And I learned that any postal code with a zero in it is a super expensive postal code.
[2650.38 → 2650.92] Did you know that?
[2651.28 → 2651.50] No.
[2652.60 → 2653.10] They're rural.
[2653.10 → 2665.72] And so at NCI, the way that our pricing algorithm worked for shipping was that we would subsidize zeros with urban postal codes
[2665.72 → 2674.44] because otherwise, literally, if someone ordered a computer case for $100, they could pay $350 in shipping
[2674.44 → 2676.48] because that's just what it costs.
[2676.48 → 2678.44] Driving a huge box out to the countryside.
[2678.44 → 2688.06] And in the interest of, you know, equity and making sure that, you know, other people in the country have access to computer parts at all,
[2688.92 → 2694.00] scrappy DP, 601-378-rural, that also isn't a postal code for crying out loud.
[2694.04 → 2695.06] That is a zip code.
[2697.74 → 2698.34] Okay.
[2699.66 → 2700.26] Wow.
[2702.06 → 2705.60] I love our American friends.
[2706.08 → 2707.24] I really do.
[2708.44 → 2712.76] But you are not the only country in the world.
[2715.48 → 2716.24] What?
[2716.66 → 2730.72] It really, it really does, like, wow, seem to be a uniquely American thing to just get very sometimes confused by things that are not America.
[2730.72 → 2736.94] Like, when we're travelling overseas, like, at Computer or whatever, and we upload videos at different times of the day,
[2738.04 → 2744.42] it's a funny thing because it is almost exclusively people in the Eastern Time Zone that are like,
[2744.72 → 2746.08] what are they doing posting a video?
[2746.16 → 2747.20] It is this time.
[2747.36 → 2751.26] And you ID yourself by telling me what time it is where you are.
[2751.26 → 2754.56] And it's never West Coast.
[2754.84 → 2756.10] It's never Central Time.
[2756.42 → 2765.56] It's always East Coast, predominantly USA, that just have absolutely, like, no concept of other time zones.
[2765.62 → 2767.32] And it's funny because I get it.
[2767.62 → 2768.54] You're not used to it.
[2768.90 → 2773.30] Like, do you remember when a hotly anticipated television program would be...
[2773.30 → 2774.00] Chewie looked it up.
[2774.08 → 2777.04] Second character being a zero indicates a rural region.
[2777.42 → 2777.58] Yeah.
[2778.22 → 2779.04] Yeah, I know.
[2779.50 → 2779.74] Okay.
[2780.26 → 2780.66] Anyway.
[2781.42 → 2782.76] I was telling them.
[2782.84 → 2783.92] Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[2784.24 → 2788.86] Okay, so do you remember when you were a kid and some hotly anticipated...
[2788.86 → 2791.24] Yeah, you just did the America thing.
[2794.90 → 2795.52] I did?
[2796.04 → 2796.40] Yeah.
[2796.40 → 2799.04] I was talking to them, and you were like, I know.
[2799.06 → 2799.46] You're talking about me?
[2799.96 → 2800.84] Oh, okay.
[2801.70 → 2803.12] Sorry, I thought you were telling me.
[2803.42 → 2804.14] No, you're good.
[2804.18 → 2804.42] You're good.
[2804.66 → 2805.26] I don't care.
[2805.34 → 2805.86] I just think it's funny.
[2805.96 → 2811.30] So do you remember when you were a kid and there'd be a hotly anticipated television event?
[2811.50 → 2812.04] Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2812.04 → 2812.28] Okay?
[2812.48 → 2817.86] And they'd be like, at, you know, 6 p.m.
[2819.38 → 2820.30] 4 p.m. Central.
[2820.78 → 2823.42] And they wouldn't even bother with the Pacific time zone.
[2823.82 → 2825.88] Literally, we've spent our whole lives.
[2826.40 → 2827.50] We're just used to minus 3.
[2827.68 → 2831.20] Just having to do minus 3 hours on everything.
[2831.80 → 2836.08] And so I understand how people who live in that particular time zone, whether they're
[2836.08 → 2840.30] American or Canadian, I can understand how they might get the idea that they are the
[2840.30 → 2841.22] only time zone on Earth.
[2842.78 → 2843.56] But they're not.
[2844.58 → 2848.42] So postal codes are not zip codes and do not work the same way.
[2848.42 → 2854.90] I do not purport to know anything about how zip codes work because I'm not American
[2854.90 → 2855.62] and I don't care.
[2855.62 → 2856.74] It doesn't really matter.
[2857.10 → 2864.00] But I learned many years ago that in Canada, that zero indicates a rural postcode.
[2864.12 → 2867.70] To be clear, when working for a Canadian retailer, shipping to Canadians.
[2868.34 → 2868.64] Yes.
[2868.64 → 2879.94] And so that was my first introduction to the concept of, oh my God, if we don't do anything
[2879.94 → 2884.42] to try to level the playing field out a little bit here, we are basically just cutting off
[2884.42 → 2890.34] a very, very significant portion of the country from being able to order from us at all.
[2890.34 → 2892.04] And so, yeah.
[2892.30 → 2897.70] Like, and it was a small amount, like literally on the order of pennies, because most people
[2897.70 → 2899.56] do live in those urban centres.
[2899.78 → 2904.78] So almost no impact to most people, but a significant positive impact to the people.
[2904.78 → 2911.84] For the handful of people that are on the outside, you know, realistically, you know, like farming
[2911.84 → 2915.16] the food that we all need to eat in these urban centres.
[2915.16 → 2915.34] Right?
[2915.40 → 2920.44] Like it's, this is, this is about, this is not about, you know, taking advantage of someone.
[2920.44 → 2926.20] This is about making sure that we are doing enough for people who are not in a not in
[2926.20 → 2927.20] a fair situation.
[2927.50 → 2927.94] Right?
[2928.10 → 2929.58] Because that's just the reality of it.
[2929.60 → 2930.56] That's what fuel costs.
[2931.26 → 2931.66] Right?
[2931.70 → 2932.90] They weren't going that way anyway.
[2933.44 → 2935.82] So, so that's how much it costs.
[2935.90 → 2936.10] Right?
[2936.74 → 2942.04] Um, what are we talking about?
[2945.34 → 2946.26] What do you want?
[2946.66 → 2950.24] Uh, no, I, the problem is, is a good question.
[2950.24 → 2950.94] Because I have no idea.
[2951.04 → 2952.30] I think Xbox stuff.
[2952.60 → 2952.84] Yeah.
[2953.30 → 2954.32] Tariffs, Xbox stuff.
[2954.68 → 2955.20] What about it?
[2955.62 → 2956.66] I think that's what we were talking about.
[2956.72 → 2957.32] Oh yeah, sure.
[2957.38 → 2958.44] I think that's our topic still.
[2958.58 → 2958.94] Oh yeah.
[2959.04 → 2960.00] Dan, should we do another topic?
[2960.06 → 2960.84] What are we supposed to be doing?
[2960.90 → 2961.72] What even is this show?
[2961.90 → 2962.40] I don't know.
[2962.60 → 2966.48] I mean, yeah, you were talking about how Boxes are more expensive because there are tariffs.
[2966.56 → 2967.62] And then now we're talking about.
[2967.94 → 2971.62] Well, I think the real question is who's buying Boxes and therefore who cares?
[2972.84 → 2974.02] See, that's a pretty good point.
[2974.10 → 2975.10] They're putting their games up too.
[2975.28 → 2976.44] That's a pretty good point.
[2977.36 → 2978.88] And actually, oh man.
[2979.16 → 2979.54] Owns them.
[2979.54 → 2980.62] So thanks Nintendo.
[2980.84 → 2982.56] Dude, I, dude, I forgot.
[2982.76 → 2988.36] I actually forgot that I had wanted to, um, shift to that as an angle for this conversation.
[2988.82 → 2993.00] How long do you think Microsoft's been waiting for an excuse to increase pricing?
[2994.36 → 2997.54] How long do you think Sony's been waiting for an excuse to increase pricing?
[2997.94 → 3003.94] If, if the US and China and everyone else just kind of Sumbawa and is all like, everything's
[3003.94 → 3004.54] good, forget it.
[3005.48 → 3007.28] What are the odds of those prices drop?
[3007.28 → 3011.00] Like, if at all.
[3011.10 → 3011.70] Give me my odds.
[3011.76 → 3012.28] Give me my odds.
[3012.54 → 3012.74] Ceremonious.
[3012.98 → 3015.92] I think they might drop, but they'll drop by a very small amount.
[3016.56 → 3017.84] I don't think they will return.
[3018.02 → 3019.16] Chat says 0%.
[3019.16 → 3022.08] I think it's got to be close to 0% that they would return.
[3022.38 → 3023.32] It never happens.
[3023.70 → 3023.80] Yeah.
[3023.80 → 3026.54] This is the problem with trade wars.
[3027.16 → 3028.38] Because then it just becomes all profit.
[3028.38 → 3029.64] I mean, this is what we went through.
[3029.64 → 3031.16] Yeah, we're never, it's never going to be the same.
[3031.24 → 3033.40] This is what we went through with the great GPU shortage.
[3034.08 → 3034.48] Oh, yeah.
[3034.80 → 3038.64] They literally just never came back down.
[3038.76 → 3045.90] A top of the line GPU is still $2,000 MSRP and realistically goes for considerably more
[3045.90 → 3046.20] than that.
[3046.26 → 3046.46] Yeah.
[3046.46 → 3046.74] Yeah.
[3047.04 → 3047.38] Yeah.
[3047.62 → 3049.72] It just never went back down.
[3049.80 → 3056.98] As soon as customers will show that they're willing to pay, you know, $25 instead of $10
[3056.98 → 3062.46] for those Shein pants, they're going to be like, oh, neat.
[3062.46 → 3066.36] Until somebody else potentially lowers it.
[3066.44 → 3070.80] In the GPU market, there was and is no actual competition there.
[3071.06 → 3072.72] So they can just keep it up forever.
[3073.06 → 3076.22] But I mean, I almost feel like this should be like a weekly segment.
[3076.46 → 3079.74] But this week on Intel Watch.
[3080.10 → 3080.76] Oh, yeah.
[3081.30 → 3081.74] Yeah.
[3082.04 → 3082.52] Oh, man.
[3082.64 → 3084.50] Here's a B580 Onyx Odyssey.
[3084.72 → 3086.74] I don't know who the heck Onyx is.
[3086.74 → 3091.34] That video, the dear Intel CEO guy is perfect.
[3091.50 → 3092.32] More people should watch it.
[3092.32 → 3093.06] But it's very good.
[3093.38 → 3093.58] Yeah.
[3093.66 → 3095.54] Views on the channel have been kind of accurately.
[3095.54 → 3096.32] The conclusion is genuinely fascinating.
[3096.64 → 3097.46] Extremely based.
[3097.64 → 3097.94] Yeah.
[3098.20 → 3099.16] Based conclusion.
[3099.34 → 3104.66] I was really happy with how that ended, to be completely honest.
[3104.78 → 3107.14] It was an extremely satisfying way to end that.
[3108.94 → 3109.98] Loose was sick.
[3110.78 → 3111.64] Absolutely sick.
[3111.84 → 3112.54] I got to say.
[3113.68 → 3115.82] I don't want to spoil it, but David's was.
[3117.82 → 3118.26] Yeah.
[3119.22 → 3119.66] Art.
[3120.38 → 3121.04] It was art.
[3121.04 → 3121.12] Yeah.
[3121.42 → 3122.18] So I want to.
[3122.38 → 3122.44] Cinema?
[3122.58 → 3123.22] That's what people say.
[3123.34 → 3123.78] It was cinema.
[3124.08 → 3124.38] I.
[3125.00 → 3125.32] Kino.
[3125.82 → 3126.06] What?
[3126.38 → 3126.74] Kino.
[3127.06 → 3127.40] Kino.
[3129.46 → 3130.08] Good job.
[3130.26 → 3131.08] Is that what people say?
[3131.38 → 3132.14] That's above cinema.
[3133.20 → 3133.94] Do people say that?
[3134.00 → 3134.74] Absolute Kino.
[3134.86 → 3135.68] Isn't Kino a lottery?
[3136.70 → 3137.10] No idea.
[3137.82 → 3138.08] Okay.
[3138.26 → 3139.88] Did you make this up or is this a thing?
[3140.08 → 3140.98] No, this is a thing.
[3141.06 → 3141.58] This is a thing.
[3145.32 → 3146.10] Absolute cinema.
[3146.10 → 3147.34] Absolute Kino though.
[3147.46 → 3148.32] But people say Kino.
[3148.72 → 3148.96] Kino.
[3149.60 → 3151.36] I can't tell if he's being real or not.
[3151.80 → 3153.46] Kino is cinema in German, apparently.
[3154.08 → 3155.26] Yeah, it's better than absolute cinema.
[3155.42 → 3155.74] Okay.
[3157.06 → 3158.24] Why don't we do another topic?
[3158.24 → 3159.08] Why don't we do another topic?
[3159.20 → 3159.36] It's a real thing.
[3160.20 → 3161.90] Is Tim Apple going to jail?
[3164.20 → 3165.74] That is an extreme.
[3165.82 → 3168.38] I think I just got click baited on my own document.
[3168.38 → 3173.10] No, but Apple Inc.
[3173.24 → 3184.90] And at least one senior executive could be facing criminal investigations after being found in wilful violation of a 2021 injunction that was a result of the Apple versus Epic Games case.
[3185.44 → 3189.38] Man, the Apple glazers during that whole time were just insufferable.
[3190.06 → 3190.62] It was rough.
[3190.86 → 3192.32] It was extremely hard.
[3192.32 → 3208.50] Basically, man, do you have any idea how many accounts with like Apple cartoon like profile pictures that I had to ban over that like six to 18 months that nobody would talk about anything but Apple versus Epic?
[3208.52 → 3209.16] Probably not enough.
[3210.46 → 3212.06] It was wild.
[3212.26 → 3215.80] It was like, dude, like I would read the comment.
[3215.96 → 3217.94] I'd be like, it can't be.
[3218.38 → 3218.66] Yep.
[3218.66 → 3223.12] Apple cartoon profile picture.
[3223.30 → 3227.10] I like I couldn't believe how strong the correlation was.
[3227.42 → 3233.60] And I'm not saying that absolutely everyone who uses those profile pictures is a Dolphus.
[3233.70 → 3234.98] That is not the case.
[3235.40 → 3241.48] I'm just saying that there was a strong correlation between confuses and people who had those profile pictures.
[3242.06 → 3245.76] There were lots of people who use those profile pictures who were not confuses.
[3246.38 → 3247.90] Just there were a lot who were.
[3248.66 → 3250.14] It's a fun required caveat.
[3250.40 → 3251.58] But anyway, anyway.
[3252.60 → 3266.60] Yeah, it was really it was really tough to sit through because it's like I get you want to cheerlead your favourite corporation that like, you know, wants all the money from your wallet and doesn't care about you at all beyond that.
[3266.72 → 3267.52] Like, I get it.
[3267.52 → 3271.32] I understand the urge to cheer for corporations.
[3271.32 → 3288.98] But it was very obvious, like how antitrust Apple was being and all of this and how you might not agree with Epic about everything, but how very obviously correct they were, at least in spirit.
[3288.98 → 3292.70] Even if the letter of the law did protect Apple to a significant degree.
[3293.34 → 3298.68] Anyway, Apple is finally getting a smackdown laid on them for all of that.
[3298.68 → 3306.34] In an 80-page ruling filed this week, U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that a few things here.
[3306.34 → 3313.92] Apple is in wilful violation of the 2021 injunction found that to hide the truth.
[3313.92 → 3325.70] Vice President of Finance, vice president of finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath and that neither Apple nor its counsel corrected the now obvious lies.
[3326.38 → 3332.40] They did not seek to withdraw the testimony or have it stricken, although Apple did request that the court strike other testimony.
[3333.02 → 3337.44] Thus, Apple will be held to have adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this court.
[3337.72 → 3338.02] Damn.
[3338.86 → 3339.20] Woo.
[3339.30 → 3339.68] Damn.
[3341.42 → 3341.94] Dang.
[3341.94 → 3347.76] The judge doesn't pull any punches and the ruling is full of quotable lies like,
[3348.08 → 3350.82] this is an injunction, not a negotiation.
[3352.06 → 3352.28] Woo.
[3352.96 → 3353.90] I need another one of those.
[3354.00 → 3354.16] Sorry.
[3354.32 → 3354.64] Dang.
[3355.36 → 3359.50] Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated.
[3359.70 → 3359.82] Damn.
[3360.38 → 3365.78] There are no do-overs once a party wilfully disregards a court order.
[3366.02 → 3366.34] Damn.
[3366.34 → 3366.46] Damn.
[3367.02 → 3377.02] The ruling also makes it clear that Apple CEO Tim Cook can't make any claims that he didn't know what was going on and notes that Cook chose poorly.
[3377.38 → 3377.68] Damn.
[3379.12 → 3388.58] The ruling also details multiple ways that Apple thwarted the injunction's goals, including a new 27% commission on outside sales.
[3388.58 → 3391.44] Oh, I guess we've never really updated you guys on what exactly it was.
[3391.44 → 3402.18] So the one thing that Epic won outright was that Apple couldn't stop app developers from directing users to an outside payment processor.
[3402.18 → 3410.74] They did say, look, Epic, you guys can't just like build your own payment processor into the Fortnite app or, you know, any other app.
[3411.20 → 3413.92] But yeah, you can direct people to an outside payment processor.
[3414.28 → 3418.42] But so the way that Apple like got around it was they were like, OK, sure, you could do that.
[3418.42 → 3435.02] But we're going to take a 27% commission on that, which would amount to a 3% discount compared to just paying the 30% to Apple, which is not a discount at all because you're probably going to be paying 3% or more to any payment processor that you're going to be using off of Apple's platform.
[3435.12 → 3435.98] You can vouch for that, right?
[3436.02 → 3437.26] Is that about what we pay on Float plane?
[3437.28 → 3437.98] Yeah, it sounds about right.
[3437.98 → 3446.40] Yeah, so basically what Apple did was they introduced a brand-new fee that made it not economically viable to use an outside payment processor.
[3447.26 → 3457.90] They also added UI changes and limitations to mislead users and scare tactics like full screen warnings when the user tried to click through to an outside payment solution.
[3458.36 → 3465.72] The court has referred this issue to the USA for the Northern District of California to determine to the USA.
[3465.72 → 3472.60] Probably I think they mean court for the Northern District of California to determine if criminal prosecution is warranted.
[3473.00 → 3474.90] Apple says they will appeal the ruling.
[3475.02 → 3481.34] But in the meantime, has updated App Store guidelines to allow links to external payments.
[3483.26 → 3485.32] Which affects us.
[3485.44 → 3486.58] That is so much better for us.
[3486.58 → 3500.18] Because you guys might not realize this, but the reason that it sucks so much to manage your subscription from within the iOS app is that Apple doesn't allow us to do that within the app unless we pay them a 30% commission.
[3500.30 → 3502.74] And we're not allowed to tell people why.
[3503.44 → 3506.72] We're literally not allowed to explain what's happening.
[3506.86 → 3509.86] Literally weren't allowed to tell people why.
[3509.92 → 3510.02] True!
[3510.24 → 3510.80] Let's go!
[3510.98 → 3511.68] Got him!
[3511.68 → 3513.22] This is actually so good.
[3513.44 → 3516.50] Even if it's literally just to tell people.
[3516.72 → 3518.36] That was all I really wanted.
[3518.64 → 3520.70] We had our app pulled from the store.
[3521.28 → 3526.50] Because it was like, we tried to tell people the same way that Netflix does.
[3526.98 → 3528.14] And they said no.
[3528.26 → 3533.62] And then I screenshot Netflix's version, which I just, sorry Netflix, directly ripped off.
[3534.18 → 3536.84] And they were like, no, and you can't use outside comparisons.
[3537.56 → 3538.78] And I was like...
[3538.78 → 3539.92] What does that even mean?
[3539.92 → 3542.98] So we had to just take everything back.
[3543.40 → 3551.66] And then we got a ton of users telling us that we were being evil because we were trying to hide people being able to cancel their subscriptions.
[3552.18 → 3557.94] Which sucked because we really just wanted to tell people how and why we weren't allowed.
[3558.38 → 3560.46] So I don't know.
[3561.12 → 3564.28] A USA, US Attorney for the Northern District of California.
[3564.44 → 3565.66] That was what they abbreviated here.
[3566.02 → 3566.58] Yeah, this is good.
[3566.98 → 3568.86] Yeah, this is fantastic.
[3568.86 → 3574.68] App makers including Stripe and Spotify have already updated their apps to take advantage of the new guidelines.
[3575.22 → 3578.56] While others like Patreon and Proton have announced they are working on doing the same.
[3578.72 → 3583.88] With Proton CEO Andy Yen announcing a price cut of up to 30% for iOS users.
[3584.02 → 3588.38] Because, yeah, it turns out the App Store fee was just a tax.
[3588.88 → 3590.08] It was an Apple tax.
[3590.24 → 3590.66] Literally.
[3591.36 → 3592.30] The Apple tax.
[3592.30 → 3594.82] And, you know what?
[3595.34 → 3601.34] I get that Apple wants to make a profit on the platform that they built.
[3601.86 → 3605.20] And they should make a profit on the platform that they built.
[3606.36 → 3612.10] It's called the $1,500 that it costs for a freaking iPhone Pro Max.
[3612.10 → 3614.16] That's the profit, Apple.
[3615.86 → 3617.64] You made the profit.
[3619.06 → 3624.62] And if someone wants to use your payment processor, then by all means, provide that as a service.
[3624.94 → 3629.48] All Epic was ever asking was for competition in payment processors.
[3629.68 → 3633.46] Payment processors should not be locked in.
[3633.46 → 3639.90] And, again, I fully comprehend the Apple Glazer argument.
[3640.38 → 3642.64] Well, Apple built the street.
[3643.50 → 3643.78] Right?
[3644.00 → 3646.38] They built the street that you set up your shop on.
[3646.58 → 3649.22] So then you should use their payment processor.
[3649.48 → 3651.30] But it's like, what if we do actually...
[3651.30 → 3652.04] Seriously, though.
[3652.06 → 3655.08] What if we take that into the real world?
[3655.62 → 3655.80] Right?
[3655.80 → 3655.84] Right.
[3656.14 → 3664.06] So because my local government, you know, paves the freaking road, and then, like, I lease my shop there.
[3664.16 → 3666.52] Do I have to use their...
[3666.52 → 3669.04] Do I have to source all of my goods from them as well?
[3669.12 → 3670.48] Like, what is this, communism?
[3670.74 → 3672.56] Like, what are we actually even talking about here?
[3672.94 → 3673.28] No.
[3673.40 → 3675.56] Why should I have to use someone's payment processor?
[3676.46 → 3680.54] Like, yeah, the software is running on their hardware, but show me an analog for this.
[3680.56 → 3683.02] You have to pay an annual fee to have an app on the App Store.
[3683.30 → 3683.44] Yeah.
[3683.44 → 3687.94] If they really wanted, they could up that, but then there would be competing stores.
[3688.18 → 3689.26] Someone else will make the road.
[3691.24 → 3691.72] You know?
[3691.80 → 3692.92] Yeah, it's a terrible comparison.
[3693.04 → 3693.50] I'm over it.
[3693.50 → 3694.50] I can understand...
[3694.50 → 3696.18] My analogy sucked.
[3697.04 → 3701.28] I can understand needing to benefit the platform that you're using, to some degree.
[3702.60 → 3704.36] But then there's going to be competition there.
[3704.36 → 3706.08] Okay, guys, I'm joking.
[3706.34 → 3706.58] I know...
[3706.58 → 3707.16] Oh, man.
[3707.32 → 3708.96] Linus, seize capitalist greed.
[3709.12 → 3710.06] What is this, communism?
[3710.30 → 3710.58] No.
[3710.82 → 3711.10] Oh.
[3711.82 → 3712.40] No, I know.
[3712.50 → 3712.90] I know.
[3712.90 → 3713.74] No, it's a joke.
[3713.86 → 3714.40] It's a joke.
[3714.54 → 3715.76] Sees anything you don't like.
[3715.80 → 3716.60] Goes, is this communism?
[3716.72 → 3716.94] Okay.
[3719.04 → 3719.44] Okay.
[3719.86 → 3722.04] Look, the point is, no.
[3722.34 → 3727.12] Just because Apple happens to own the land on which I operate my store does not mean that
[3727.12 → 3733.76] they get to 100% dictate the terms of what I can sell in my store and what services that
[3733.76 → 3737.32] I can use in order to take payment from people.
[3738.18 → 3738.58] No.
[3738.58 → 3738.64] No.
[3739.92 → 3741.36] And now that is law.
[3741.36 → 3742.30] It's a rough analogy.
[3742.54 → 3743.46] Just don't worry about it.
[3743.46 → 3744.20] Now it's law.
[3744.92 → 3745.28] There.
[3745.40 → 3750.50] That's all you need to know is that now you can expect your in-app purchases on iOS devices
[3750.50 → 3751.36] to be more affordable.
[3751.76 → 3754.68] And if Google's smart, they're going to look at this and go...
[3754.68 → 3757.20] And make sure that they're aligned with it.
[3757.46 → 3758.54] Hopefully that happens.
[3759.54 → 3760.48] Slack messages here.
[3760.56 → 3764.96] Handyman has been saying that there's more to this story, including some crazy Slack messages.
[3764.96 → 3771.02] Tim SP says there are some malls which try to force vendors to use certain payment processors
[3771.02 → 3772.86] so they can do whole mall gift certificates.
[3773.36 → 3777.74] So one thing that does break down in that particular example is that customers can use
[3777.74 → 3778.08] cash.
[3778.64 → 3781.76] They have the option of using something else.
[3781.76 → 3789.16] On the app store, that was Epic's whole argument is that you only have one choice, and you don't
[3789.16 → 3794.36] even so much as have the ability to put up a little sign that says, hey, there's a 3% discount
[3794.36 → 3795.22] to use cash.
[3796.44 → 3800.50] You have no choice whatsoever there.
[3800.60 → 3806.64] That's actually a much, much, much better way of illustrating the problem here.
[3806.64 → 3813.22] So apparently these internal Slack messages are just about like the language of different
[3813.22 → 3813.50] things.
[3813.56 → 3819.38] This one says, an employee said that some of the draft language for leaving the app to
[3819.38 → 3822.92] pay for something didn't sound scary enough.
[3822.92 → 3830.92] And they want to scare users a bit to raise questions and hesitancy when clicking on...
[3830.92 → 3831.68] That's amazing.
[3832.32 → 3832.90] Stuff.
[3833.50 → 3835.96] That's hilarious in Slack communications.
[3836.64 → 3840.88] Like if you're on the web, you will leave the app and be taken to an external website
[3840.88 → 3843.18] because external website sounds scary.
[3843.30 → 3844.30] So execs will love it.
[3845.46 → 3846.72] That's hilarious.
[3847.72 → 3854.78] It's amazing how just like, yeah, duh, but also just, yeah, like they actually, like they
[3854.78 → 3856.88] are exactly as...
[3856.88 → 3865.52] I will also say though, like if, if you're surprised by that, like, damn dude, that level
[3865.52 → 3868.20] of stuff is happening at these companies all the time.
[3868.28 → 3868.66] Every day.
[3868.84 → 3869.12] Yeah.
[3869.30 → 3869.62] Every day.
[3869.68 → 3874.22] I mean, honestly, like to a certain degree, if you just want to compete well and be a
[3874.22 → 3876.94] like reasonably smart company, you're making decisions like this.
[3877.00 → 3877.20] Okay.
[3877.26 → 3877.96] Smash champs.
[3878.12 → 3881.98] When we designed our internal flow for how people walk in and out of the building.
[3882.22 → 3883.08] Exit through the gift shop.
[3883.08 → 3886.38] It's like the most classic business thing ever.
[3886.72 → 3886.86] Yeah.
[3887.14 → 3891.50] We have another door that we could have used that people could walk straight onto the court
[3891.50 → 3897.64] and we barred it because we want people to walk through the pro shop and walk past
[3897.64 → 3899.82] the concession area before they can get to the courts.
[3899.98 → 3903.72] And then we want them to walk past the concession area and through the pro shop before they can
[3903.72 → 3904.24] leave the courts.
[3904.36 → 3906.32] This is, this is very standard.
[3906.42 → 3907.52] That is business 101.
[3908.18 → 3912.08] That was, yeah, that, those messages like, yeah, they're bad, I guess, but that's, I'm
[3912.08 → 3913.06] very not surprised.
[3913.10 → 3914.56] I've seen way worse stuff.
[3914.58 → 3917.06] Well, they're bad because of the monopolistic nature.
[3917.14 → 3918.40] Think about the that's what's bad.
[3918.48 → 3918.68] Totally.
[3918.76 → 3922.08] But think about like the, the Tesla stuff where they're like sharing footage from people's
[3922.08 → 3922.66] cars and stuff.
[3922.68 → 3924.74] Like we, we've seen way worse things.
[3924.78 → 3927.34] We've talked about way worse things on the show before.
[3927.48 → 3929.98] But, like, but the key, the key.
[3929.98 → 3930.54] No, I get it.
[3930.54 → 3930.94] It's bad.
[3931.00 → 3931.30] I get it.
[3931.30 → 3932.14] Is the monopoly.
[3932.30 → 3932.56] Totally.
[3932.70 → 3933.00] I get it.
[3933.00 → 3933.36] That's the key.
[3933.46 → 3933.62] Yeah.
[3933.62 → 3938.16] And they're trying to push the monopoly anyway, despite losing the thing by using
[3938.16 → 3939.58] scary language and stuff like that.
[3939.62 → 3940.42] I'm not saying it's good.
[3940.52 → 3941.50] I'm not saying it's good.
[3942.14 → 3944.04] I'm just saying we've seen a lot worse.
[3944.18 → 3949.76] And if that's like surprising to you, like, dude, businesses do be doing business.
[3949.96 → 3953.44] Top Gear 1224 says they do force vendors, not try to.
[3953.62 → 3955.24] Customers don't have the right to use cash.
[3955.32 → 3957.84] Most places are card only because they don't want to deal with cash walking off.
[3957.84 → 3959.30] But that's, that's not the same thing.
[3959.54 → 3962.64] That's not the venue dictating that customers can't use cash.
[3962.64 → 3967.08] That is the store deciding not to take cash.
[3967.32 → 3968.68] Which benefits his argument.
[3968.96 → 3969.24] Yes.
[3969.66 → 3971.48] That is exactly what I was saying.
[3971.58 → 3973.02] The store should have a choice.
[3973.38 → 3973.50] Yeah.
[3974.10 → 3977.16] There should be a lower cost alternative.
[3977.48 → 3981.50] And that can absolutely be a reasonable choice, especially in like high crime areas.
[3981.60 → 3981.94] Absolutely.
[3982.22 → 3985.94] If you want to have a little sign-up that says no cash on premises, and you want it to be
[3985.94 → 3987.36] real, you need to not take cash.
[3988.06 → 3988.42] Yeah.
[3988.42 → 3988.54] Yeah.
[3991.82 → 3992.28] Uh oh.
[3992.32 → 3995.68] Are people mad at me about my, uh, about the exit through the gift shop thing?
[3995.74 → 3996.88] Oh, actually, no, not too bad.
[3997.52 → 3998.24] Not too bad.
[3998.72 → 3999.04] The gift shop.
[3999.28 → 4000.54] The pro shop's doing great, by the way.
[4000.94 → 4001.16] Yeah.
[4001.28 → 4001.44] Yeah.
[4001.44 → 4002.12] In case anyone's wondering.
[4002.14 → 4003.90] I noticed you guys were low on rackets.
[4004.14 → 4004.26] Oh yeah.
[4004.26 → 4005.16] Which is a good thing.
[4005.28 → 4005.56] Yeah.
[4005.72 → 4007.22] Well, and a terrible thing.
[4007.54 → 4007.70] Yeah.
[4007.70 → 4010.36] You got to get more, but it's a good sign that you're actually selling them.
[4010.60 → 4012.50] Are we working on an update for the float plane app?
[4012.50 → 4015.08] Uh, well, yeah.
[4016.00 → 4016.44] Okay.
[4017.96 → 4018.82] It'll be a bit.
[4019.16 → 4019.48] Yeah.
[4019.94 → 4020.20] Cool.
[4020.78 → 4026.52] And realistically, it's less of an impact for us because we already were not charging a
[4026.52 → 4030.92] 30% Apple tax because we literally just, that's not, that's not compatible with our
[4030.92 → 4032.30] business model at all.
[4032.84 → 4034.58] It was not going to be a thing.
[4034.68 → 4040.68] Like float plane does not, if we, if, if we were just like, yeah, uh, 30% of gross receipts.
[4040.68 → 4041.88] Here you go.
[4041.94 → 4042.30] Apple.
[4043.56 → 4046.74] The what would have been, what would have been left?
[4046.88 → 4046.98] Luke?
[4047.10 → 4052.54] It's already a thing that splits multiple ways, splitting it another way is like, yeah.
[4052.54 → 4054.52] Cause it splits between the creator and the platform.
[4054.52 → 4054.86] Right.
[4055.04 → 4058.00] And also the payment processor, which we like still have to pay.
[4058.54 → 4062.56] Um, so, so that's why you can't subscribe in the app.
[4062.68 → 4064.32] That's why you can't unsubscribe in the app.
[4064.64 → 4068.76] So we've just had people sign up on the website, like on the web.
[4068.76 → 4072.66] And then just like use their account to sign in to the app.
[4072.72 → 4073.98] That's the only way we've been able to do it.
[4074.00 → 4077.14] So it'll, it'll work like that until such time as we can get it updated.
[4079.66 → 4081.34] Um, this is interesting.
[4081.50 → 4081.62] Yeah.
[4081.68 → 4085.54] Context menu says in the UK, they're talking about introducing legislation to maybe force
[4085.54 → 4090.34] companies to accept cash as digital payment methods are disproportionately impacting older
[4090.34 → 4092.76] people who still use cash as their primary or only payment method.
[4092.80 → 4092.88] Yeah.
[4092.88 → 4097.98] That's not just elderly, like maybe that's kind of the spin on it in the UK, but I know
[4097.98 → 4105.12] that over here, um, a lot more of the people that I've encountered who are like cash only
[4105.12 → 4111.88] people are more, uh, like they don't trust banks or they, um, yeah, it mostly comes down
[4111.88 → 4115.14] to like not trusting banks or not wanting their purchases tracked.
[4115.14 → 4117.72] Like it's kind of more of a privacy argument.
[4118.24 → 4125.12] And I, I see it, I see it both of those ways, both from like an accessibility and from a like
[4125.12 → 4133.48] privacy standpoint, the challenge though is like, man, like, have you seen some of those,
[4133.54 → 4139.58] some of those wild tech talks of like McDonald's restaurants that have been turned into fricking
[4139.58 → 4143.78] fortresses because they're in these like super high crime rate areas.
[4143.78 → 4150.16] And they're like, everything's barricaded off and stuff like, Oh dude, I wouldn't, I wouldn't
[4150.16 → 4152.70] want to handle cash if I was working in a place like that.
[4152.70 → 4155.36] So I don't really know how to reconcile that man.
[4156.38 → 4165.44] Um, I don't have a solution.
[4165.60 → 4167.52] I definitely see this one both ways.
[4167.52 → 4173.76] Personally, I, I have been, I've been almost zero cash for so long that someone handed me
[4173.76 → 4178.10] a $1 coin, someone handed me a loony the other day, and I was like, Whoa, this is really light
[4178.10 → 4182.48] because it turns out they actually changed the composition of them since the last time
[4182.48 → 4183.04] I held one.
[4183.36 → 4187.26] Like I just, I just do not use cash anymore.
[4187.72 → 4190.80] Uh, but I definitely understand why some people prefer it.
[4193.00 → 4197.94] There is at least one place that I go decently often that only takes cash, which is really
[4197.94 → 4198.28] annoying.
[4199.00 → 4200.24] Is it that gas station you like?
[4200.56 → 4200.82] No.
[4201.24 → 4201.62] Okay.
[4202.10 → 4202.34] Yeah.
[4202.90 → 4204.66] Uh, Oh haircut.
[4204.90 → 4205.12] Yeah.
[4205.28 → 4205.52] Yeah.
[4205.52 → 4206.20] I can see that.
[4206.40 → 4212.64] I mean, during COVID, most of the cash only places like the holdouts, um, switched to taking
[4212.64 → 4213.54] digital payments.
[4213.90 → 4217.08] Um, people dealing with cash at that time was stuff.
[4217.34 → 4218.88] I'm not sure how to read this.
[4219.38 → 4224.10] Um, people are saying that the Apple thing only applies to American stores.
[4224.10 → 4225.40] Uh, for now.
[4226.60 → 4227.00] Yeah.
[4227.00 → 4228.72] But that means we would not be able to update.
[4229.36 → 4231.22] Couldn't we for American customers?
[4231.22 → 4232.38] But that's what I'm trying to figure out.
[4232.38 → 4236.56] So the, the line is linked to other purchase methods.
[4236.82 → 4243.52] Developers may apply for entitlements, apply keyword to provide a link in their app to a
[4243.52 → 4243.86] website.
[4243.98 → 4249.64] The developer owns or maintains a responsibility for in order to purchase digital content or
[4249.64 → 4250.02] services.
[4250.02 → 4250.68] So sure.
[4250.78 → 4251.24] No problem.
[4251.30 → 4252.72] We could link to full planes' website.
[4252.82 → 4253.20] That's fine.
[4253.32 → 4253.50] Yeah.
[4253.50 → 4258.84] These entitlements are not required for developers to include buttons, external links, or other
[4258.84 → 4261.34] calls to action in their United States storefront apps.
[4261.54 → 4263.32] I genuinely don't know what that means.
[4263.40 → 4264.08] I might just be dumb.
[4264.92 → 4266.34] I mean, we can always try it.
[4266.74 → 4272.36] These entitlements are not required for developers to include buttons external.
[4272.54 → 4277.68] Oh, so you don't have to apply if you're a U.S. store, but you can apply if you're not
[4277.68 → 4278.18] a U.S. store.
[4278.28 → 4278.44] All right.
[4278.46 → 4279.16] Well, we'll see what happens.
[4279.16 → 4281.84] So we can apply, but they're...
[4281.84 → 4282.14] They might just say no.
[4282.14 → 4284.36] Or just never respond to it.
[4284.76 → 4285.28] Nice.
[4285.44 → 4287.30] I could absolutely see that being a thing as well.
[4287.30 → 4292.22] Well, yeah, especially now that their internal Slack messages and emails and everything get
[4292.22 → 4293.80] perused.
[4294.18 → 4294.58] Yeah.
[4294.88 → 4297.74] On a seemingly somewhat regular basis around this.
[4298.00 → 4298.32] Yeah.
[4299.12 → 4300.92] Should we...
[4300.92 → 4301.48] Should we...
[4301.48 → 4303.12] Have we only done two topics already?
[4303.50 → 4303.86] Yeah.
[4303.86 → 4305.22] Is that...
[4305.22 → 4306.34] You seem...
[4306.34 → 4306.66] Pretty cool.
[4307.32 → 4308.76] You seem unfazed by that.
[4309.34 → 4313.90] I have a hard out from you, so we're on track to make that.
[4313.90 → 4314.90] We're quite far from the hard out.
[4314.98 → 4315.94] The hard out's...
[4315.94 → 4317.48] Well, actually, I think...
[4317.48 → 4318.30] A pretty distant goal.
[4318.36 → 4320.86] I think my hard out time might have also been wrong.
[4321.52 → 4322.78] So that's something.
[4322.98 → 4323.24] What?
[4323.40 → 4324.84] What is the actual hard out?
[4324.86 → 4326.08] Have we been bamboozled?
[4326.44 → 4328.20] Well, see, I don't...
[4328.20 → 4329.24] I've been lied to.
[4329.98 → 4330.50] I don't know.
[4330.50 → 4331.12] I'm just deceived.
[4332.60 → 4333.00] Okay.
[4333.24 → 4335.86] Technically, I think I'm supposed to be somewhere at eight.
[4336.66 → 4338.08] But I also don't really like...
[4338.08 → 4338.30] What?
[4338.58 → 4339.08] It's not...
[4339.08 → 4340.40] It's not that hard, though.
[4340.50 → 4342.34] We were told your hard out was nine.
[4342.44 → 4343.26] It's kind of soft.
[4343.60 → 4344.24] It's soft.
[4344.64 → 4345.04] Okay.
[4345.38 → 4345.64] Yeah.
[4345.64 → 4346.78] Let's do some merch messages.
[4346.92 → 4347.50] We're still fine.
[4347.52 → 4348.28] A pre-hard out?
[4348.72 → 4349.44] We're still fine.
[4349.60 → 4350.48] Um, I swear...
[4350.48 → 4351.96] I swear, this has never happened before.
[4352.88 → 4353.36] Um...
[4353.96 → 4355.42] You can go...
[4355.42 → 4356.54] You can go grill some cheese.
[4356.62 → 4357.34] I'm stealing some Chewy.
[4357.42 → 4358.04] It's Chewy's joke.
[4358.16 → 4358.66] Oh, man.
[4358.66 → 4359.22] I'm taking it.
[4359.36 → 4359.88] It's mine now.
[4359.88 → 4360.84] Oh, man.
[4360.84 → 4361.06] Get on, Chewy.
[4361.80 → 4362.38] Chewy, fine.
[4362.82 → 4364.14] No, I'm not doing it.
[4364.22 → 4365.32] You explain merch messages.
[4365.46 → 4366.72] I'm on temporary strike.
[4367.18 → 4368.60] Uh, if you go on...
[4368.60 → 4369.74] Ooh, is it on both?
[4369.82 → 4370.68] I don't remember.
[4371.34 → 4371.66] Uh-oh.
[4371.92 → 4373.08] Do merch messages work?
[4373.10 → 4373.24] Let's see.
[4373.34 → 4373.76] One second.
[4374.28 → 4374.52] Hold on.
[4374.58 → 4375.74] People are sending them, right, Dan?
[4376.10 → 4376.46] Yep.
[4376.68 → 4377.86] Okay, then they must work.
[4377.88 → 4378.26] They work.
[4378.34 → 4378.92] Yeah, they're on pause.
[4379.02 → 4379.32] Sick.
[4379.44 → 4379.84] Good job.
[4379.94 → 4380.24] Oh, jeez.
[4380.36 → 4381.06] What a wizard.
[4381.44 → 4382.30] Look at this guy.
[4382.56 → 4382.96] Amazing.
[4382.96 → 4384.50] Look at how he's doing stuff.
[4384.92 → 4386.18] There isn't 100...
[4386.18 → 4387.74] Not everything's absolutely perfect.
[4387.74 → 4390.36] Like, you can't Flow plane sign in on the global store and stuff like that.
[4390.40 → 4392.34] But, like, it's pretty good.
[4392.56 → 4394.12] You have to consider time constraints.
[4394.24 → 4394.82] It's pretty good.
[4395.30 → 4395.82] But, yeah.
[4395.88 → 4396.42] Merch messages.
[4396.54 → 4398.38] You go on LTT store, global or not.
[4398.62 → 4400.00] Add something to your cart.
[4400.00 → 4404.00] And in the cart, you will see this box right here.
[4404.14 → 4407.22] If you click the little check there, you can send a message.
[4407.52 → 4410.08] And it will appear at the bottom of the screen.
[4410.40 → 4413.98] And that guy up there might respond to it.
[4413.98 → 4418.66] Or he could curate it for probably Linus, but one of us to respond to.
[4418.92 → 4420.62] There's a curated one for you this week.
[4420.72 → 4422.22] Yeah, but you have to go to the bathroom or something.
[4422.22 → 4422.78] Oh, I can do that.
[4422.78 → 4424.34] That still aligns with what I said.
[4424.34 → 4432.70] Have fun wee-weeing.
[4434.86 → 4435.58] Okay.
[4436.70 → 4437.80] Gotta go Nintendo!
[4439.10 → 4440.12] So, Luke.
[4440.46 → 4441.22] What's up?
[4441.52 → 4443.50] What are your thoughts on...
[4443.50 → 4448.34] Now I'm on top of you.
[4448.34 → 4449.78] Question for Luke.
[4449.84 → 4458.76] What are your thoughts on the legitimacy of the Why Is When Late Series, considering the judge is under the payroll of one of the contestants?
[4459.02 → 4460.82] I've raised this as a concern multiple times.
[4461.18 → 4462.38] This is a problem.
[4462.56 → 4462.92] It is.
[4462.92 → 4487.16] I think not only is that a problem, but I think the judge's natural inclination towards interesting content instead of legitimacy and accuracy brings to question the results when the results lean towards someone who has a proven history and has an extreme record of precedence for not showing up on time.
[4487.16 → 4491.70] And somehow, even when he doesn't show up on time, still gets marked as a win.
[4491.92 → 4498.02] It's concerning, to be clear.
[4499.02 → 4500.52] I would agree completely.
[4500.84 → 4504.68] The problem is that we don't have anybody to complain to because he also pays our bills.
[4504.88 → 4505.14] Yeah.
[4505.92 → 4506.40] It's tough.
[4507.18 → 4508.14] It's a tough one.
[4508.96 → 4510.06] How much you can do about it?
[4511.68 → 4512.46] Oh no.
[4512.86 → 4513.90] He sent his minions.
[4514.14 → 4515.40] I thought you were gone!
[4515.40 → 4515.52] What?
[4517.10 → 4518.98] I am an unbiased guy.
[4519.40 → 4521.74] Sammy, come and defend your honour.
[4522.66 → 4524.94] I am unbiased and wise-kindly.
[4525.20 → 4526.82] I didn't realize it's not even six yet.
[4527.64 → 4529.04] I keep it professional.
[4529.74 → 4531.00] I have high morale?
[4531.26 → 4531.84] What is it?
[4532.10 → 4534.40] Yes, I have high standards for myself.
[4534.50 → 4534.82] There you go.
[4534.84 → 4535.22] Morals.
[4535.34 → 4535.60] Morals.
[4535.66 → 4535.98] Morals.
[4536.10 → 4536.96] I have morals.
[4537.20 → 4537.98] But you wouldn't say high.
[4538.10 → 4539.18] You said like strong morals.
[4539.24 → 4539.96] I have strong morals.
[4539.98 → 4540.36] There you go.
[4540.48 → 4540.64] Sure.
[4542.08 → 4542.86] Subscribe to Full Plane.
[4544.20 → 4545.16] Most of them are.
[4545.40 → 4547.70] I got like jump scared by Sammy.
[4548.36 → 4549.86] He just appeared.
[4550.72 → 4551.76] He's just orange.
[4552.26 → 4553.24] Probably ran.
[4554.24 → 4555.56] That was wild.
[4558.12 → 4563.66] So that definitely sells it that he's definitely weighted towards Linus.
[4564.34 → 4564.84] Oh yeah.
[4564.94 → 4565.44] Oh yeah.
[4565.72 → 4565.98] Totally.
[4566.14 → 4567.02] I think at least a little bit.
[4567.14 → 4567.42] Totally.
[4567.52 → 4567.76] Totally.
[4567.88 → 4568.04] Totally.
[4568.04 → 4568.76] At least a little bit.
[4569.00 → 4569.92] I'm still going to win though.
[4570.88 → 4571.98] Yeah, because you're actually here.
[4572.24 → 4572.54] Yeah.
[4572.54 → 4573.76] Which is the point.
[4573.94 → 4574.78] I was early today.
[4574.92 → 4576.20] I got a new work laptop.
[4576.36 → 4580.68] And I'm literally thinking like I'm just going to schedule the show up like way early and
[4580.68 → 4581.44] just work on set.
[4581.50 → 4582.72] We could have been on time today.
[4582.74 → 4584.18] But he was talking about cheese.
[4584.38 → 4585.12] I even gave it a countdown.
[4585.82 → 4587.22] I gave it a countdown on everything.
[4588.28 → 4589.46] Wait, were we late?
[4589.88 → 4592.14] We were late because he wouldn't listen to me.
[4592.14 → 4593.94] I had this thing.
[4594.54 → 4599.40] It was, we had, we were going to be on time perfectly for the first time for like ever.
[4599.82 → 4600.54] That's funny.
[4601.42 → 4604.64] Tinker Watch says it should be Yvonne that is in charge of Wise Way and Late.
[4605.78 → 4606.62] That's worse.
[4607.66 → 4608.74] Honestly, no.
[4609.10 → 4609.78] Oh yeah, that's right.
[4611.36 → 4616.10] Knowing Yvonne, she would probably vote for me to the point where it might be unfair the
[4616.10 → 4616.54] other way.
[4616.78 → 4617.18] Yeah.
[4617.50 → 4620.26] I want my husband home to spend time with his family.
[4620.26 → 4623.10] It should be Luke's mom.
[4623.20 → 4625.78] No, I love my mom.
[4625.90 → 4627.88] She would definitely vote for me more often.
[4628.70 → 4630.26] Yeah, it would be unfair.
[4630.80 → 4635.40] I don't, I don't know why it's not me because you know, when you parked illegally in the handicap
[4635.40 → 4643.90] spot sideways the other week, both of you left to go and insult each other outside, leaving
[4643.90 → 4646.98] me alone with still no title or thumbnail.
[4646.98 → 4653.14] So I think you both lost on that one because he could have stayed here, done the title and
[4653.14 → 4656.08] thumbnail, and then it really would have been your fault for making us late.
[4656.32 → 4658.42] Did he, did he not lose on that one?
[4658.72 → 4664.58] I think he thought he lost, but we were later because of your antics.
[4664.58 → 4669.36] We should have both lost on that one.
[4669.48 → 4669.86] I don't know.
[4669.92 → 4671.28] I'm okay with us both losing.
[4671.46 → 4671.94] I don't know.
[4673.18 → 4674.48] Oh, it's my turn for the I don't know.
[4674.98 → 4676.42] Yeah, it's, I, there you go.
[4676.62 → 4677.28] What, we're here.
[4678.62 → 4679.98] The handicap spot, that's not cool.
[4680.08 → 4682.30] I didn't even realize it was there.
[4682.42 → 4683.06] I'm sorry.
[4683.30 → 4683.48] I moved my car.
[4683.48 → 4684.64] That's how little he cares.
[4684.96 → 4685.74] Oh my God.
[4685.74 → 4693.20] Oh my God.
[4696.72 → 4699.04] He's just very loudly getting snacks.
[4699.96 → 4703.02] I mean, I think he's trying to make it louder.
[4706.08 → 4707.26] Can you guys hear that?
[4707.88 → 4709.72] I'm convinced he's trying to make it louder.
[4712.10 → 4713.62] Why is this such a process?
[4713.62 → 4715.78] You can come back now.
[4716.44 → 4717.38] How many snacks?
[4717.54 → 4719.24] Just two bags of chip for all that noise?
[4719.40 → 4719.78] They're a mixed bag.
[4719.78 → 4720.60] Don't judge me.
[4720.98 → 4722.48] Why was there so much noise though?
[4723.32 → 4725.50] You wanted specific bags, and you had to dig for them?
[4725.90 → 4726.38] Yeah, it's like a...
[4726.38 → 4729.52] Well, what?
[4729.56 → 4731.88] I'm not going to just take a random flavour of chips.
[4732.58 → 4734.04] I knew something was going on.
[4734.06 → 4736.70] They're not even calorie worthy if they're not the right flavour.
[4736.90 → 4737.44] That's true.
[4738.04 → 4740.76] I still, I don't even agree that that's the right flavour still, but you...
[4740.76 → 4743.60] Sea salt malt vinegar kettle chips is not the right flavour.
[4743.62 → 4747.40] The boxes that we get don't have the right flavour in them.
[4747.50 → 4750.44] My cheese takes are no longer the most controversial food takes.
[4750.44 → 4752.64] Miss Vicky's jalapeño is definitely the best.
[4753.90 → 4755.06] Well, we don't have that though.
[4755.08 → 4755.64] That's what I'm saying.
[4755.72 → 4757.22] I don't think the boxes have the best flavour.
[4757.34 → 4758.16] What are you even talking about then?
[4758.16 → 4759.78] I don't think any of them are calorie worthy.
[4769.02 → 4770.42] Nobody wants plain chips?
[4770.48 → 4771.86] I didn't say plain chips!
[4772.86 → 4773.98] Miss Vicky's jalapeño.
[4774.22 → 4775.06] What is this?
[4775.56 → 4776.04] Where is that going from?
[4776.04 → 4778.04] Why are all of them like this?
[4778.56 → 4780.30] Why do you love submarines so much?
[4780.78 → 4781.88] Instead of plain chips.
[4782.10 → 4783.68] They don't even fit in our products.
[4784.96 → 4785.84] Oh, man.
[4786.06 → 4786.70] So much should...
[4786.70 → 4787.60] Oh, fuck.
[4787.60 → 4789.60] I'm surprised nobody's made plain chips.
[4790.82 → 4791.52] Plain chips.
[4791.52 → 4792.02] That's a good one.
[4792.12 → 4792.56] That's actually...
[4792.56 → 4793.64] Yeah, that's solid.
[4794.52 → 4795.08] That's solid.
[4795.88 → 4797.42] What are we supposed to be doing right now?
[4797.42 → 4798.38] You're going to do a merch message.
[4798.44 → 4799.28] No, you're going to read it.
[4799.54 → 4801.12] There's your consumable brand.
[4801.20 → 4803.74] But you were doing one merch message the whole time I was gone?
[4803.86 → 4804.82] I don't think we even did one.
[4804.84 → 4806.08] Yeah, that was the merch message.
[4806.10 → 4806.54] Oh, that was?
[4806.60 → 4807.76] I thought you just asked me that.
[4807.96 → 4809.04] No, that was the merch message.
[4809.12 → 4809.96] We did a merch message.
[4810.46 → 4811.18] Good job.
[4811.32 → 4813.04] They specifically wanted Linus not here.
[4814.58 → 4815.62] Now you do an announcement.
[4815.86 → 4816.54] Did they ask for that?
[4816.62 → 4816.88] Yes.
[4817.62 → 4817.88] Huh.
[4818.18 → 4819.10] Wait, so...
[4819.10 → 4820.20] That was oddly convenient.
[4820.40 → 4821.10] I can do announcements.
[4821.50 → 4822.86] We told him to leave.
[4823.24 → 4823.92] And then he did.
[4824.28 → 4825.84] Oh, I thought he just went to the...
[4825.84 → 4826.10] No.
[4826.56 → 4827.08] I spaced out...
[4827.08 → 4828.22] Get your head in the game!
[4829.16 → 4830.20] I'm losing it.
[4830.20 → 4831.00] Ah!
[4831.76 → 4832.76] Flow plane announcement!
[4833.56 → 4839.08] Get a glimpse of the day-to-day at Linus Media Group with this week's exclusives.
[4839.14 → 4844.42] You can meet Emily Seddon, one of our post-production supervisors that helped release all the amazing
[4844.42 → 4845.54] LTT videos you watch.
[4845.90 → 4848.58] You can learn about her favourite memory with Linus.
[4849.42 → 4849.70] What?
[4850.70 → 4853.40] A little bit more about the gamer van that we built her.
[4853.80 → 4855.84] And much, much more.
[4856.04 → 4858.76] So we've got that here for Meet the Team.
[4858.76 → 4860.48] Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[4861.26 → 4862.20] What do people say?
[4862.38 → 4862.64] No?
[4862.80 → 4863.10] Okay.
[4863.68 → 4865.44] I'm going to have to watch this.
[4865.50 → 4869.74] I'm extremely curious what Emily Seddon's favourite moment would be.
[4870.14 → 4872.98] We also have Sarah's Q&A coming up.
[4873.04 → 4875.20] You can submit your questions for her Q&A.
[4875.60 → 4877.46] Behind the scenes, creating the Alex Week trailer.
[4877.58 → 4878.82] That was so cool.
[4879.50 → 4880.86] That was flippin' awesome.
[4880.86 → 4883.06] Yeah, fire's more of your thing.
[4883.14 → 4888.22] You can watch Alex, Andy, and Sebastian play with a lot of fire in this week's Behind the Scenes.
[4888.40 → 4888.50] Heck yeah.
[4889.02 → 4891.48] If you're with our insurance company, please look away.
[4891.90 → 4893.12] No one snitch.
[4893.28 → 4893.88] I like it.
[4893.88 → 4895.88] Okay.
[4897.56 → 4902.24] So we're supposed to watch from 9.14 to 9.30.
[4902.88 → 4903.82] One second here.
[4903.88 → 4904.90] Let me just fire this up.
[4905.60 → 4907.84] I have not watched this yet either.
[4907.94 → 4908.68] Am I about to see something?
[4908.90 → 4909.30] Can you smile more?
[4909.68 → 4909.92] What?
[4910.10 → 4911.30] Can you smile like a maniac?
[4911.80 → 4912.06] Okay.
[4912.32 → 4912.46] Yeah.
[4913.14 → 4914.50] Yeah, like, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[4914.50 → 4915.48] Like mad scientist.
[4915.48 → 4917.94] Ha, ha, ha.
[4918.32 → 4919.42] Oh, yes.
[4919.42 → 4922.72] We are making the best week ever.
[4926.62 → 4928.86] He honestly did a perfect job with that.
[4929.16 → 4929.88] Stop it.
[4929.98 → 4930.34] There you go.
[4930.60 → 4931.80] He did a perfect job with that.
[4932.68 → 4933.90] He actually killed it.
[4933.96 → 4938.56] I mean, asking Alex to act like a mad scientist is like...
[4938.56 → 4939.16] It is great.
[4939.16 → 4940.28] I mean, asking you to act like Luke.
[4941.50 → 4943.74] Hey, Luke, could you act like Luke, please?
[4944.46 → 4944.86] Okay.
[4946.00 → 4946.62] Luke, you did it.
[4946.64 → 4947.28] I don't know what to do.
[4947.58 → 4948.68] You could laugh really loud.
[4949.42 → 4951.42] I scared people at a restaurant recently.
[4953.42 → 4954.34] There you go.
[4954.42 → 4954.70] It was okay.
[4954.76 → 4955.02] Perfect.
[4955.48 → 4959.44] I went out for lunch with Lucas and Nick from the lab to do like a labs' leadership lunch
[4959.44 → 4959.70] thing.
[4960.08 → 4964.26] And I don't remember what was said, but somebody said something and I got a good one in and
[4964.26 → 4966.08] like everybody jumped.
[4966.24 → 4968.62] I like apologized.
[4970.30 → 4971.48] Are you in Langley Vietnamese?
[4972.10 → 4972.44] No.
[4972.68 → 4972.96] Okay.
[4974.08 → 4975.12] Where were you guys?
[4975.56 → 4977.16] Should I be embarrassed if I go somewhere?
[4977.26 → 4977.88] Like, do they know?
[4977.96 → 4979.02] Do they know we're affiliated?
[4979.42 → 4981.52] Uh, probably not.
[4981.68 → 4981.92] Okay.
[4982.00 → 4982.18] Cool.
[4982.26 → 4983.70] I don't remember the...
[4983.70 → 4984.42] Ruby Siam.
[4984.98 → 4985.28] Okay.
[4986.32 → 4986.98] Never been there.
[4987.08 → 4987.26] Yeah.
[4987.36 → 4987.62] Cool.
[4987.76 → 4987.90] Yeah.
[4987.90 → 4988.20] All right.
[4988.32 → 4988.46] Yeah.
[4988.60 → 4993.76] There are certain restaurants locally that like a lot of LMG, Creative Warehouse, float
[4993.76 → 4999.50] plane staff go to where they like, you know, know, you know who we all are.
[4999.58 → 4999.82] Yeah.
[4999.82 → 5000.42] Yeah.
[5000.42 → 5000.60] Yeah.
[5000.68 → 5002.76] But they also probably wouldn't have been surprised by you.
[5002.94 → 5003.18] No.
[5003.70 → 5003.90] Yeah.
[5003.96 → 5004.40] They would have known.
[5004.66 → 5005.44] Experienced it already.
[5006.10 → 5011.78] Anyway, you can check this all out at LMG.GG slash float plane or on our members page on
[5011.78 → 5013.50] YouTube if that's more your cup of tea.
[5013.62 → 5013.84] All right.
[5013.88 → 5014.84] Dan, what are we supposed to be doing?
[5015.32 → 5016.06] Another merch message.
[5016.06 → 5018.14] Oh, did we not do the second one yet?
[5018.22 → 5018.42] No.
[5018.50 → 5019.00] Good Lord.
[5019.10 → 5019.32] All right.
[5019.36 → 5019.62] Hit me.
[5019.78 → 5020.02] Hi.
[5020.14 → 5024.96] I recently watched your home server room build videos and was wondering why you did not install
[5024.96 → 5028.74] a water-to-water heat pump to increase the heat that you take out of that room and put
[5028.74 → 5029.72] into the pool.
[5029.72 → 5029.76] Cool.
[5030.40 → 5030.72] Okay.
[5031.44 → 5036.22] So, for starters, that would have been harder.
[5037.64 → 5043.24] I mean, with all the various iterations of what we ultimately ended up doing, it wouldn't
[5043.24 → 5043.90] have been harder.
[5043.90 → 5046.70] It would have been much easier to just do it properly in the first place.
[5047.46 → 5055.68] But what I was hoping was that I wouldn't have to expend electricity on the heat exchanging
[5055.68 → 5057.94] situation other than just pumping the water.
[5057.94 → 5064.18] And I have discovered that, no, in fact, that will not be easily very possible.
[5064.92 → 5069.92] So, I currently don't actually believe that anyone who mentions heat pumps on the internet
[5069.92 → 5072.38] is not a technology connections watcher.
[5072.64 → 5074.54] I have basically decided this.
[5074.82 → 5077.22] Anytime anyone mentions heat pump, I'm like...
[5077.22 → 5080.94] I'm just confused that people didn't...
[5080.94 → 5088.80] Like, it was like years and years ago that I just like to read some like basic article that
[5088.80 → 5093.32] was like air conditioner versus heat pump versus radiant heating.
[5093.78 → 5096.66] Like, this is probably like 20 years ago or something like that.
[5096.88 → 5099.34] And it was like, heat pump is the best.
[5099.40 → 5101.30] And I was like, okay, heat pump is the best.
[5101.30 → 5107.42] And then I've just been kind of sitting around, like, waiting as people like figure this...
[5107.42 → 5111.62] Like, it seems like this has just been a known quantity for like a really, really long time.
[5111.82 → 5115.78] Like when we were talking recently about how they have been kind of demonized in Germany
[5115.78 → 5117.12] on WAN show.
[5117.36 → 5117.48] Yeah.
[5117.54 → 5118.22] Remember that?
[5118.46 → 5119.24] And I was like, what?
[5119.36 → 5120.10] Demonized of what?
[5120.20 → 5121.46] Who doesn't like efficiency?
[5121.78 → 5122.54] There are...
[5122.54 → 5123.54] They're not perfect.
[5123.54 → 5125.28] The Germans, apparently.
[5125.44 → 5126.60] They shut down all the nuclear plants.
[5130.96 → 5131.86] Got him!
[5132.22 → 5133.34] I'm actually upset.
[5134.92 → 5135.70] That hurt.
[5136.54 → 5137.10] Sorry.
[5139.86 → 5140.42] Yikes.
[5140.56 → 5141.98] And the mood goes to zero.
[5142.44 → 5142.76] Cool.
[5144.42 → 5148.72] So anyway, I found the whole thing kind of confusing because I thought just like everyone
[5148.72 → 5151.02] knew that heat pipes are kind of sick.
[5151.02 → 5154.48] But it seems like a lot of people still don't know that.
[5156.70 → 5157.14] Yeah.
[5157.32 → 5159.68] Anyway, so heat pipes.
[5160.78 → 5163.48] No, I did not learn about them on Technology Connections.
[5163.90 → 5171.78] But I love that he talks about them a lot and says how cool they are because they really
[5171.78 → 5172.20] are cool.
[5172.76 → 5179.12] Like, it blew my mind when I found out that it costs so much more to heat with resistive
[5179.12 → 5186.40] heating compared to like the multiple times more efficient that using a compressor and
[5186.40 → 5191.84] a heat pipe, a heat pipe, a heat pump can be for heating.
[5191.96 → 5195.04] And then also the fact that, whoa, no way, they can also like do cool as well.
[5195.16 → 5196.70] Like heat pumps are super cool.
[5197.46 → 5199.36] That's what I installed in my old place.
[5199.36 → 5205.62] And that's what I didn't want to install in my mechanical room downstairs because I didn't
[5205.62 → 5208.60] really want to pay to run an air conditioner all year round.
[5209.24 → 5213.96] My hope was that in the winter with the pool running at like 10 degrees, which is kind of
[5213.96 → 5217.48] what they recommend, that it would adequately cool the room.
[5217.86 → 5218.52] And it does.
[5218.64 → 5219.72] It works great.
[5219.72 → 5227.24] Unfortunately, in the summer with the pool in the like mid to high 20s, this is Celsius,
[5227.42 → 5227.84] by the way.
[5228.68 → 5229.82] Yeah, not so good.
[5229.90 → 5231.50] It does remove all the heat from the room.
[5231.88 → 5232.88] Like I can close the door.
[5233.00 → 5235.64] It's an insulated room, and it does remove it all.
[5235.66 → 5238.74] And it works way better than it used to now that we have it right at the back of the rack.
[5239.52 → 5242.84] But it's pretty uncomfortably hot in there and it kind of sucks.
[5242.84 → 5250.12] So I actually was chatting with Jake today and I think the plan is to actually use a yacht
[5250.12 → 5256.64] AC because they're designed for liquid to liquid on both sides.
[5257.34 → 5262.96] So what we're going to do is we finally, I hate it when this happens.
[5263.12 → 5267.42] So you know that Jacky video that we did recently where we made a water door for the server room
[5267.42 → 5267.96] over at the lab.
[5268.74 → 5269.14] Okay.
[5269.14 → 5276.78] Anyway, we did that video and literally, literally one of the companies that we reached out to
[5276.78 → 5280.84] to try to get a proper one and was like, nah, forget it.
[5281.80 → 5285.76] Got in touch with us after seeing that video and was like, hey, yeah, like we could send
[5285.76 → 5286.28] you one.
[5286.76 → 5287.76] I was like, oh, come on.
[5287.90 → 5289.68] We wanted to do it properly in the first place.
[5289.80 → 5294.82] But because we're not ordering a hundred of them, you know, no data centre supplier was
[5294.82 → 5296.96] interested in building us any water doors.
[5297.38 → 5297.50] Yeah.
[5297.50 → 5303.70] So anyway, now I'm getting a water door for my basement because we already have a functioning
[5303.70 → 5304.06] one here.
[5304.14 → 5304.64] The office.
[5305.54 → 5306.84] I guess we're just leaving it there.
[5306.92 → 5308.02] I didn't actually ask Jake that.
[5308.10 → 5308.82] Maybe we should get in the right.
[5308.88 → 5309.44] It doesn't matter.
[5309.70 → 5311.38] The point is we're getting one for my basement.
[5311.64 → 5311.74] Two.
[5311.88 → 5312.02] Yeah.
[5312.14 → 5317.92] So we're going to run a cold loop there off of the cold side of the AC, which will probably
[5317.92 → 5322.22] be a heat pump because a lot of AC, a lot of air conditioning units are just heat pumps.
[5322.22 → 5324.72] So we'll run that off the cold side.
[5324.78 → 5327.60] And then the hot side will go off of the pool loop.
[5327.60 → 5332.38] Unfortunately, that means that I have to pay to run the compressor all the time, which
[5332.38 → 5336.32] I'm not realistically with like modern efficient compressors is honestly probably not that
[5336.32 → 5336.52] bad.
[5336.86 → 5338.18] So that's the new plan.
[5338.42 → 5338.88] So that sucks.
[5338.94 → 5339.68] But I think it makes sense.
[5339.68 → 5340.72] So we'll have a chill.
[5340.72 → 5341.56] That room does cook.
[5341.56 → 5345.20] Yeah, we'll have a chilled water door at the back of the server rack.
[5345.30 → 5350.14] And then we'll try to capture as much as we can of the heat coming off of the systems
[5350.14 → 5350.58] inside.
[5350.74 → 5356.18] I don't know how those water cooled systems are going to figure into all this because
[5356.18 → 5358.20] there's honestly no point having them water cooled.
[5358.32 → 5361.42] If you have a chilled water door, you would just take the hot air coming out of the back
[5361.42 → 5361.90] of the systems.
[5361.98 → 5363.10] You would blow it through your water door.
[5363.28 → 5368.42] But also typically the fans that you're using in a setup like that are super loud, like high
[5368.42 → 5371.96] static pressure, like server fans, which I don't want in that room.
[5372.06 → 5376.48] I quieted down that room, like very intentionally recently quieted down that room.
[5376.78 → 5381.30] So maybe, maybe chilled water to the servers.
[5382.00 → 5382.74] Probably not.
[5383.06 → 5386.82] Probably what we would do is we would take the ultimate version of the chiller.
[5387.08 → 5388.24] Everything comes back.
[5391.34 → 5391.78] Okay.
[5392.72 → 5395.24] So I have something I'm really excited about.
[5395.24 → 5398.76] You just got to get Yvonne to buy the like heat pump for you or something.
[5398.88 → 5399.98] It's way better than my old chiller.
[5400.14 → 5404.42] So Luke's referring to the time for one of my birthdays that Yvonne bought me a window
[5404.42 → 5411.60] mounted AC unit so that I could dismantle it, dip the cold side into just like a giant,
[5411.64 → 5420.82] like Igloo brand cooler reservoir, and then pump windshield de-ice to my CPU and GPUs as
[5420.82 → 5423.02] like a 24-7 sub-zero setup.
[5423.44 → 5424.22] It's pretty sick.
[5424.22 → 5424.86] It's pretty sick.
[5424.92 → 5425.86] That's what he's referring to.
[5425.98 → 5430.82] You can, you can check it out in the staff reacts to Linus's old Jacky rigs video that
[5430.82 → 5431.54] we did a while back.
[5432.78 → 5435.70] No, no, we're going to take it to a completely different level.
[5436.48 → 5442.46] So I'm not going to name any names because, you know, the timeline is TBD and you never
[5442.46 → 5442.62] know.
[5442.72 → 5447.62] Things can, things can fall through, but I am in touch with someone who back in the day
[5447.62 → 5452.10] created phase change coolers.
[5452.10 → 5453.84] Oh yeah, this is so sick.
[5453.92 → 5455.54] I know about this, but I can't say anything.
[5455.64 → 5456.06] Okay, cool.
[5456.26 → 5463.62] Phase change coolers that I lusted over in my, in my post adolescent pants.
[5463.62 → 5472.74] Um, and he hasn't done one in a long time, but we offered to do a collab slash commission
[5472.74 → 5474.52] build, and he's super down.
[5474.62 → 5475.76] Which is so sick.
[5475.76 → 5485.16] Um, so what my goal is, is to make a 24 seven is to turn my system 24 seven phase change
[5485.16 → 5485.46] cooled.
[5485.70 → 5486.54] So sick.
[5486.60 → 5493.62] So I think we're targeting like somewhere between minus 20 and minus 50 or something like
[5493.62 → 5493.78] that.
[5493.82 → 5495.40] Like minus 20 to minus 40.
[5495.40 → 5503.34] Um, and if we can build a high enough capacity unit, then I could potentially do CPU and GPU
[5503.34 → 5510.82] and we could make blocks that could be adapted to future, uh, sockets and future GPUs.
[5510.88 → 5512.96] And then just, I could carry them forward.
[5513.10 → 5518.96] So what I would like is to have it fit in a rack mount form factor right under my gaming
[5518.96 → 5519.30] rig.
[5519.30 → 5523.12] And so my rig would essentially be like sub-zero cooled.
[5523.12 → 5526.94] And then all the other rigs would just be water cooled off of the pool water, not the
[5526.94 → 5530.06] actual pool water, the water that runs through the loop that goes through the walls of the
[5530.06 → 5531.84] pool and is isolated from the chlorinated water.
[5531.92 → 5532.38] Don't worry.
[5532.48 → 5532.90] Just chill.
[5533.72 → 5534.82] That's pretty sick.
[5534.86 → 5538.46] And then all the other heat in the room will be dealt with by the water door.
[5539.50 → 5540.82] Did you intentionally do that one?
[5541.52 → 5542.18] I don't know.
[5542.46 → 5543.36] Oh, just chill.
[5543.50 → 5544.10] You'll all, yeah.
[5545.00 → 5545.08] Yeah.
[5545.10 → 5546.02] Only a little though.
[5546.24 → 5548.12] I was just going to ignore it and keep moving.
[5549.84 → 5553.00] It's kind of like how you'll, you'll hear me anytime I'm working with a case.
[5553.00 → 5554.96] You'll say whatever, I'll say whatever the case may be.
[5554.96 → 5556.82] Or in this case, I like go out of my way to do it.
[5556.88 → 5557.00] Yeah.
[5557.06 → 5557.18] Yeah.
[5557.18 → 5557.32] Yeah.
[5557.32 → 5557.44] Yeah.
[5557.44 → 5557.54] Yeah.
[5557.54 → 5558.78] I'm not talking about a case right now, Dan.
[5563.42 → 5565.20] So yeah, I am.
[5565.40 → 5565.92] That's sick.
[5566.04 → 5566.30] Like.
[5567.04 → 5568.90] I didn't actually realize that's what it was for.
[5569.20 → 5569.88] There's also.
[5569.92 → 5570.36] That's cool.
[5570.40 → 5570.74] You know what?
[5570.74 → 5574.04] I'm going to, I'm going to spoil this one and you guys are going to be so disappointed
[5574.04 → 5575.20] if now it doesn't work out.
[5575.44 → 5580.66] I'm going to spoil this part, but because we're going to be working with like HVAC stuff,
[5580.66 → 5588.82] this could be, if it aligns, if it aligns with him travelling to the Vancouver area, could
[5588.82 → 5591.86] be an opportunity for us to hang out with Brian, the electrician again.
[5592.38 → 5593.18] Oh, cool.
[5593.30 → 5594.24] Which would be pretty cool.
[5594.36 → 5594.88] That'd be pretty cool.
[5594.96 → 5595.10] Yeah.
[5595.10 → 5600.82] Um, we haven't collabed in a long time, but I, I would be, he, he's got all the certifications
[5600.82 → 5605.98] that he would need to help us charge these systems and, you know, just be there, make
[5605.98 → 5610.36] sure that even though, um, the our collaborator has experience working with this stuff, he's
[5610.36 → 5611.30] not technically certified.
[5611.30 → 5616.28] So Brian would be there to make sure that everything's on the up and up, and we're capturing all the
[5616.28 → 5617.10] gases correctly.
[5617.10 → 5621.22] And he can also get access to some of the more exotic gases that we might need if we were
[5621.22 → 5624.06] to take things to another level potentially in the future.
[5624.36 → 5624.60] Nice.
[5625.76 → 5626.92] Is he still an electrician?
[5626.98 → 5631.46] No, but I mean, do I still give tech tips?
[5632.06 → 5632.46] Debatable.
[5633.64 → 5636.62] Sometimes, sometimes a nickname just sticks, you know?
[5637.32 → 5640.50] You did earlier, you helped me with my function key problem.
[5641.14 → 5641.68] That's true.
[5641.74 → 5642.30] I did do that.
[5642.38 → 5643.14] You gave me a tech tip.
[5643.24 → 5644.10] That was a tech tip.
[5644.28 → 5644.52] Yep.
[5644.62 → 5645.08] You're welcome.
[5645.28 → 5645.62] Thank you.
[5646.24 → 5647.80] Uh, what, what else are we supposed to be doing down?
[5648.56 → 5649.70] Was that a merge message?
[5649.70 → 5650.14] Yeah.
[5650.50 → 5651.24] Let's do some more topics.
[5651.82 → 5653.04] I don't even know what the question was.
[5653.12 → 5653.74] It doesn't matter.
[5654.42 → 5656.94] You're, uh, why didn't you put a heat pump in your pool?
[5657.04 → 5657.74] Yeah, I'm over it.
[5658.22 → 5658.70] No, it's fine.
[5659.44 → 5660.00] I will.
[5660.36 → 5661.10] It's all good.
[5661.50 → 5661.84] Cool.
[5661.86 → 5663.20] Do you want to talk about some AI news?
[5663.68 → 5664.16] Do I?
[5664.70 → 5665.20] I don't know.
[5665.44 → 5671.26] Researchers from the University of Zurich are facing, uh, possible legal action due to
[5671.26 → 5676.88] running an improper and highly unethical experiment as one of Reddit's lawyers, Ben Lee, has
[5676.88 → 5677.46] described it.
[5677.46 → 5681.16] The researchers deployed AI chatbots to a popular...
[5681.16 → 5682.42] Oh, this is crazy.
[5683.08 → 5683.44] Sorry.
[5683.68 → 5689.70] ...to a popular debate Subreddit called r slash Channelview, which is primarily a place where
[5689.70 → 5693.74] users post their hot takes or opinions and have an open conversation in the comments.
[5693.74 → 5698.92] The bots made more than a thousand comments over several months pretending to be real people
[5698.92 → 5705.84] in order to debate in these discussions, um, with kind of the idea behind it being to find
[5705.84 → 5710.20] out if an AI is effective at changing a real human user's mind.
[5710.20 → 5718.14] However, where things get a little sketchy is that these AI chatbots were diving into sensitive
[5718.14 → 5722.92] topics such as racial issues, uh, domestic violence and more.
[5723.32 → 5731.42] Um, with some bots even going into the OP's account and trying to determine...
[5731.42 → 5731.66] They were...
[5731.66 → 5736.98] They were explicitly instructed to determine who it was that they were trying to debate so
[5736.98 → 5742.58] they could make a more tailored comment in order to debate them more convincingly.
[5743.12 → 5744.16] So, they were...
[5744.16 → 5744.46] They were...
[5744.46 → 5745.06] Oh, man, dude.
[5745.12 → 5746.00] It's not in our notes.
[5746.00 → 5746.86] But they were...
[5746.86 → 5750.32] They were asked to, like, go through and try to profile them.
[5750.58 → 5756.46] Try to figure out their age, race, area where they lived, uh, what their interests were,
[5756.90 → 5757.46] and then...
[5757.46 → 5761.72] And then told to crap out an argument that would try to change their mind.
[5762.08 → 5763.50] Um, this is a note from Elijah.
[5763.68 → 5766.50] He says, reading this part actually scared the f*** out of me.
[5766.62 → 5766.80] Yeah.
[5767.24 → 5772.56] Uh, Reddit was not made aware of this experiment, which is the reason that it is considering a
[5772.56 → 5773.56] lawsuit.
[5773.56 → 5776.04] Any thoughts?
[5779.32 → 5779.76] Yeah.
[5780.54 → 5782.86] Uh, this is an interesting one.
[5782.98 → 5783.94] For every...
[5783.94 → 5784.60] Oh, no, go ahead.
[5784.78 → 5785.16] There's...
[5785.16 → 5788.80] There's been a lot of stuff about, uh, AI manipulation going around lately.
[5788.92 → 5789.86] This was a big part.
[5790.40 → 5792.22] Um, another big one.
[5792.26 → 5797.60] And I noticed this too, but didn't really fully put it together until I saw other people
[5797.60 → 5798.58] start talking about it.
[5798.80 → 5803.54] But, uh, a lot of different AI chatbots, in my example, and most of them, are the
[5803.54 → 5806.42] most of the examples that I saw, because I think it's probably most commonly used, chat
[5806.42 → 5815.04] TPT, but other ones as well, have started just like really, um, gassing up the, the,
[5815.04 → 5816.28] the human in the interaction.
[5816.74 → 5819.84] Like, no matter what you do, they're like, oh, you're so amazing.
[5819.84 → 5821.70] That was such a smart thing to say.
[5821.70 → 5828.08] I was asking it questions about the Canadian election, trying to get ideas of the policies
[5828.08 → 5829.74] of different people and stuff like that.
[5829.96 → 5834.80] And every single time I would ask it a question, it would be like, that was a good, no, very
[5834.80 → 5835.94] good question to ask.
[5835.96 → 5840.00] And I was like, this was a really basic question.
[5840.00 → 5847.02] And somewhere in a data centre, you know, carbon is being emitted in order to produce those
[5847.02 → 5847.40] words.
[5847.60 → 5847.66] Yeah.
[5848.06 → 5850.60] I mean, maybe it was a perfect question to ask.
[5850.70 → 5853.60] I mean, maybe it's better than asking those questions after the election.
[5853.60 → 5857.90] Like we saw spikes in interest after the November elections in the States.
[5858.04 → 5858.70] Yeah, it's rough.
[5859.10 → 5863.98] Uh, but yeah, apparently this was like, apparently this is totally a thing.
[5863.98 → 5872.48] Um, recently they started really, really, really like just being crazy positive and just pumping
[5872.48 → 5873.50] people up super hard.
[5873.86 → 5877.04] And a lot of it's because people like that.
[5878.58 → 5884.14] Uh, so that's going on, and apparently it's going to be dialled back because it's a little
[5884.14 → 5884.84] bit too obvious.
[5884.84 → 5885.54] It's too much.
[5886.02 → 5888.72] Um, but I suspect it's still going to happen at least a little bit.
[5889.10 → 5893.96] Um, and people are starting to realize that when you are talking about the fact that you
[5893.98 → 5898.18] are talking to these chatbots, they are actively looking at your entire history of conversations
[5898.18 → 5898.90] all the time.
[5900.12 → 5905.48] So that's, I didn't actually necessarily realize that a new chat is fully isolated.
[5905.60 → 5906.30] It's not.
[5907.40 → 5911.50] Um, they, they will like, like you can ask it things about yourself.
[5911.50 → 5912.60] Like I will ask it.
[5912.60 → 5913.66] Hold on, hold on, hold on though.
[5913.70 → 5916.74] Is this like, is this like identifier cookie based?
[5916.74 → 5919.28] Cause like, I don't even have an account.
[5919.84 → 5923.48] So if I just like go use it, then theoretically I don't know about that.
[5923.48 → 5925.46] Mine is within my account for sure.
[5925.48 → 5925.70] Okay.
[5925.70 → 5925.94] Okay.
[5926.00 → 5926.18] Okay.
[5926.22 → 5926.54] Carry on.
[5926.58 → 5926.72] Sorry.
[5926.80 → 5933.70] Like I can ask it something about like, um, like, does this seem like a good fit for
[5933.70 → 5934.00] me?
[5934.46 → 5941.66] And I can ask it that with no context other than that, I can not define myself, and it'll
[5941.66 → 5943.88] be like, yeah, because blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5943.88 → 5945.64] And it'll bring up things about the lab.
[5945.66 → 5946.92] It'll bring up things about float plane.
[5947.00 → 5949.26] It'll name float plane just out of nowhere.
[5949.26 → 5953.52] Sometimes I like, I'll ask it about some technology thing.
[5953.56 → 5955.02] It'll be like, this could be good for float plane.
[5955.72 → 5960.76] And like, I haven't talked about float plane in maybe a couple of weeks, but it still recognizes
[5960.76 → 5962.40] that because I've talked about float plane before.
[5962.72 → 5968.02] It happened to me a few days ago and scared me because I had completely forgotten this was
[5968.02 → 5968.40] a thing.
[5968.40 → 5970.42] And I was asking it some innocuous question.
[5970.42 → 5973.90] And it's like this thing that's related to extremely specific things that you asked another
[5973.90 → 5974.20] time.
[5974.20 → 5976.22] And it was, uh, uh, destabilizing.
[5976.36 → 5976.72] I'll put it that way.
[5976.74 → 5977.96] I'm the security risk then.
[5979.82 → 5982.10] Maybe I shouldn't be posting all of our data into it.
[5982.10 → 5982.22] Yeah.
[5982.22 → 5984.54] Maybe you guys shouldn't be chatting with AI so much.
[5984.60 → 5985.32] I got to confess.
[5985.44 → 5986.90] I feel like this is that much really.
[5987.04 → 5991.20] I feel like this is somewhere that I'm kind of falling behind a little bit because I don't
[5992.12 → 5992.68] use.
[5992.78 → 5995.72] I honestly use it most often for experiments.
[5995.72 → 5999.94] Like somebody told me recently that, uh, oh, they're hallucinating like way less now
[5999.94 → 6006.70] because I was making this argument that, uh, we will all become dumber for using it.
[6006.80 → 6012.96] And I think my biggest example of that has been people calling on, uh, chatbots on Twitter,
[6013.08 → 6013.98] uh, X or whatever.
[6014.46 → 6017.64] Um, the like at grok is this real thing.
[6017.66 → 6021.64] And then just always taking the answer of that at face value.
[6021.64 → 6022.04] Yeah.
[6022.18 → 6026.94] I saw, I saw, I saw a fascinating one that was, uh, someone asked grok if it's
[6026.94 → 6032.06] true what the current us administration said about increases in military recruitment and
[6032.06 → 6032.72] groks like, yep.
[6032.98 → 6038.82] And they're like, Hey grok, isn't it true though, that any increases in recruitment now are a
[6038.82 → 6041.62] result of Joe Biden's policies and groks like, yep.
[6042.76 → 6043.20] Right.
[6043.26 → 6047.06] But doesn't that seem like important context that you kind of left out grok.
[6049.28 → 6050.50] But, but that's the thing.
[6050.50 → 6056.78] And I'm not even saying that grok is somehow, you know, politically leaning one way or the
[6056.78 → 6057.00] other.
[6057.12 → 6057.40] Sure.
[6057.52 → 6062.54] I'm just saying that that's clearly a flaw in any kind of AI system because there's no
[6062.54 → 6066.36] way that it's going to be able to provide all the relevant context because if it
[6066.36 → 6070.44] was, then it would just crap out a link to Wikipedia every single time you asked it anything.
[6071.04 → 6073.04] I don't know if it tells you when it makes them night author.
[6073.14 → 6074.96] I don't fully believe that, but sure.
[6075.18 → 6078.26] It says that's a specific feature called memories, and it tells you when it makes them.
[6078.26 → 6081.96] And it's quite literally never told me that it's made a single one.
[6082.02 → 6083.10] So I'm not so sure about that.
[6084.88 → 6086.34] Maybe it's just not very obvious.
[6086.50 → 6086.82] I don't know.
[6086.90 → 6090.52] But either way, I'm not necessarily trying to turn it off either.
[6090.52 → 6093.38] But it's, it's just interesting.
[6093.52 → 6099.86] So I ran a thing where I tried to do at least one query a day and I would fairly intensely
[6099.86 → 6105.52] fact check it every time to try to see like how often is it more or less hallucinating.
[6105.74 → 6107.52] And it's still really often.
[6107.90 → 6108.30] Yeah.
[6108.40 → 6110.58] This is, we'll just take it fully at face value.
[6110.68 → 6111.38] It's so crazy.
[6111.62 → 6115.06] Nippleless cage in float plane chat says, I asked grok something about Elon Musk and it
[6115.06 → 6116.88] said that's because he was the founder of Tesla.
[6116.88 → 6121.30] And when I corrected grok, it was like, oh yeah, yeah, but that happens like all the
[6121.30 → 6121.66] time.
[6121.70 → 6125.62] Like people are really only correcting it on the things that they automatically detect
[6125.62 → 6128.86] is wrong, but it's wrong a lot more often than you probably think.
[6129.08 → 6130.64] Yvonne and I have been car shopping recently.
[6130.96 → 6133.20] And like, like I said, I, I don't know.
[6133.28 → 6134.88] It doesn't mean it's not helpful to be clear.
[6134.98 → 6139.32] I feel like I'm falling behind the times in, in a sense, because I wouldn't, it would
[6139.32 → 6144.98] never occur to me to just, she, to, she typed up a profile of herself and was like,
[6144.98 → 6146.38] what car would you recommend?
[6146.58 → 6148.06] You know, a cool car for cool moms.
[6148.66 → 6149.88] Kind of, here's what I do with it.
[6149.94 → 6151.08] Here's how many kids I have.
[6151.18 → 6152.48] Here's what I'm driving right now.
[6152.58 → 6153.36] Here's what I like about it.
[6153.38 → 6154.12] Here's what I don't like about it.
[6154.14 → 6155.32] She is like kind of gave it a whole thing.
[6155.88 → 6162.18] And to its credit, it crapped out basically the same cars that I had painstakingly narrowed
[6162.18 → 6163.08] our search down to.
[6165.30 → 6168.40] But it also got a bunch of little things wrong about them.
[6169.10 → 6169.50] Yeah.
[6169.50 → 6173.10] And because I had done all of that research very recently.
[6173.38 → 6173.40] You knew.
[6173.40 → 6174.16] So you actually knew.
[6174.48 → 6174.98] I knew.
[6175.12 → 6176.68] But it looks really legit.
[6176.76 → 6177.72] It's really convincing.
[6177.82 → 6180.38] So if you didn't already know, you might not have questioned it.
[6180.52 → 6182.60] And I think that's happening like way too much.
[6182.70 → 6183.38] Anyway, sorry.
[6183.58 → 6185.28] But where did we start here?
[6185.54 → 6189.34] We're talking about the trying to debate people on Reddit.
[6191.24 → 6192.96] They're getting in trouble for this or whatever.
[6192.96 → 6197.54] Remember the next line on here that you had to read was Reddit was not made aware of this
[6197.54 → 6201.10] experiment, which is the reason it is leading to a possible lawsuit.
[6201.28 → 6202.38] I think I did read that, but it's okay.
[6202.56 → 6204.74] I'm really happy this experiment happened.
[6205.06 → 6205.38] Really?
[6205.78 → 6207.22] I think people need to know this.
[6207.42 → 6213.64] Well, I mean, for me, the main thing that I took away from this is the experiment
[6213.64 → 6214.80] we know about.
[6215.16 → 6215.50] Yeah.
[6216.24 → 6220.18] It's there are no experiments that are running that are this.
[6220.18 → 6221.74] And I guarantee you.
[6221.94 → 6222.40] Well, constantly.
[6222.40 → 6224.86] I mean, isn't that the entire Twitter platform now?
[6225.06 → 6228.50] As far as I can tell, I cannot tell the difference between the people and bots anymore.
[6228.74 → 6231.74] But yeah, this used to happen because it was paid people.
[6232.78 → 6235.26] There used to be bots that were much more obvious.
[6235.50 → 6238.86] Now it's automated, and it's a lot less obvious.
[6239.54 → 6247.80] And like it's we there has been an inflection point on the Internet and everything has changed
[6247.80 → 6249.44] and you need to be aware of that.
[6249.44 → 6250.04] Check this out.
[6250.20 → 6251.98] Freelancer system in float plane chat says,
[6251.98 → 6257.00] We had a recent situation at my workplace where people were petitioning to remove the
[6257.00 → 6261.36] labour union because Gemini gave an answer to the question.
[6261.70 → 6263.64] Can a business owner speak on wages?
[6263.78 → 6266.10] Well, a petition is in process and said yes.
[6266.10 → 6268.10] And it was completely wrong.
[6268.16 → 6270.58] And then it cited links that weren't actually relevant to the answer.
[6270.58 → 6275.30] Like this is a problem.
[6275.30 → 6276.96] This is a problem.
[6276.96 → 6278.86] The biggest problem with AI right now is people.
[6281.96 → 6285.24] But like actually, people are just taking the output.
[6285.58 → 6291.18] We've a lot of people have been screaming for so long that you can't just take the output and automatically believe it.
[6291.18 → 6295.40] But people just do it because it's the path of least resistance.
[6295.40 → 6296.20] It's easy.
[6296.40 → 6298.02] The answer is right there, right?
[6298.04 → 6298.74] I'll just take it.
[6298.76 → 6299.24] It's fine.
[6299.36 → 6300.14] I'll submit it.
[6300.24 → 6300.96] I'll use this.
[6301.00 → 6301.44] It's okay.
[6301.76 → 6302.66] No, it's not.
[6302.66 → 6306.44] It's wrong all the time.
[6306.54 → 6307.88] It lies all the time.
[6309.74 → 6310.58] Oh, man.
[6310.82 → 6314.28] When I was asking it, it gets really blatant stuff wrong too.
[6314.52 → 6320.60] When I was asking it about like Carney and Pole and all that kind of stuff, it got a bunch of things wrong.
[6320.72 → 6323.90] Like it said that Carney wasn't the prime minister at the time.
[6324.28 → 6325.04] And I was like, um.
[6325.18 → 6326.12] He definitely was.
[6326.26 → 6327.18] He actually is.
[6327.18 → 6328.62] And it was like, oops, my bad.
[6328.76 → 6329.78] Keeping on going on.
[6329.88 → 6332.14] And I was like, that's a pretty major mistake.
[6332.66 → 6337.08] Like there's a lot of little ones, but that one's like huge.
[6337.40 → 6339.66] Well, it probably got confused because he didn't have a zero.
[6339.92 → 6341.32] He didn't have a zero in his name.
[6341.42 → 6343.16] So it thought he wasn't rural or something.
[6343.34 → 6343.74] Right.
[6343.90 → 6344.16] Yes.
[6344.22 → 6344.40] Yes.
[6344.50 → 6346.20] I thought it was a zip code instead of.
[6349.54 → 6351.42] I just, man, I don't know.
[6352.42 → 6354.58] But yeah, this experiment fascinating.
[6354.64 → 6354.96] Oh, nice.
[6355.04 → 6355.30] Good job.
[6355.68 → 6357.10] This experiment is fascinating.
[6358.14 → 6362.64] In other news, several months ago, there was a lawsuit opened against character technology.
[6362.66 → 6365.74] Oh, we've, I think we've talked about this like four times.
[6365.82 → 6366.04] Yes.
[6366.18 → 6368.14] But this is an update though.
[6368.36 → 6374.12] Oh, after a 14-year-old took his own life after this teen had several conversations with
[6374.12 → 6377.94] fictional characters, several of which convinced him to take his life.
[6378.40 → 6384.06] Now character technologies is making the claim that chatbots outputs should be considered
[6384.06 → 6390.08] pure speech, essentially protecting them under the first amendment or the right to free speech
[6390.08 → 6391.72] as free speech.
[6392.98 → 6397.90] This is still an ongoing case and there has been more discussion about what would be classified
[6397.90 → 6400.34] as free speech versus what would be responsible.
[6400.34 → 6403.22] Versus whom would be responsible for this if it's not.
[6403.92 → 6404.22] Yeah.
[6404.46 → 6415.34] So I, dude, liability around artificial intelligences is something that it kind of surprises me that
[6415.34 → 6418.78] we have not even kind of begun to figure out.
[6418.78 → 6425.94] Like when you consider how long self-driving and also actually self-driving cars have been
[6425.94 → 6429.66] cruising around on the roads without users touching the steering wheel.
[6429.96 → 6435.98] I mean, in the case of the like the self-driving ones, like your Teslas, theoretically, it tells
[6435.98 → 6437.50] the user like, Hey, you're responsible.
[6437.66 → 6438.06] You're liable.
[6438.06 → 6438.46] Right.
[6438.46 → 6443.42] But in the case of, you know, Waymo, for instance, like there, there isn't a driver.
[6443.58 → 6453.74] It's like, who is liable for what a machine learning AI does?
[6453.96 → 6456.66] And you could say, okay, no, this is like really black and white.
[6456.88 → 6460.34] It's the it's the company that made it.
[6460.84 → 6464.74] But in this case, clearly they're making the argument that they're not.
[6465.86 → 6466.30] Right.
[6467.64 → 6468.08] Yeah.
[6468.46 → 6474.82] And you would think that for how long we've had, you know, like thousand multi thousand
[6474.82 → 6481.96] kilogram things flying around on streets, um, where this question seems pretty relevant,
[6481.96 → 6486.42] you would think for how long that's been happening, this would have been something that
[6486.42 → 6489.26] we would have figured out by now.
[6489.66 → 6497.64] But it seems like we are still in the very infancy of even starting to approach thinking
[6497.64 → 6501.96] thinking about figuring out liability around this stuff.
[6501.96 → 6509.70] And I don't know, as, as a as an open AI shareholder, you know, I'm not, but if I was,
[6509.74 → 6515.12] I was going to say like, as an open AI shareholder, I'd be terrified right now because I have no
[6515.12 → 6518.40] idea what I'm potentially going to be liable for.
[6518.40 → 6527.16] And I have no idea what the volume of mistakes is going to be before some kind of accountability
[6527.16 → 6528.24] comes calling.
[6528.76 → 6530.76] Like I have, we have no idea.
[6530.98 → 6537.18] It feels similar to the like a company commits a, a crime, uh, is by the law considered as
[6537.18 → 6539.54] a person, but does not go to jail thing.
[6539.64 → 6543.48] It feels like there's going to be one of those, like effectively a loophole that really plagues
[6543.48 → 6544.06] society.
[6544.06 → 6546.42] I feel like this is going to be one of those types of problems.
[6546.74 → 6547.10] Yeah.
[6547.20 → 6548.28] But what's that from, by the way?
[6548.62 → 6553.48] Uh, IBM, IBM service manual 1979.
[6555.48 → 6556.30] I like it.
[6556.40 → 6562.22] I've, this is, this gets put around a lot, uh, and has been for years, but now that AI is
[6562.22 → 6565.24] such a big thing right now, this has been pushed around quite a bit.
[6565.78 → 6570.76] Um, and yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty good.
[6570.76 → 6576.64] Like you were the what made me actually think about this was you bringing up that, uh, they
[6576.64 → 6581.78] almost, uh, did they, what they almost busted a union or something because of whatever, because
[6581.78 → 6583.34] of a rock outfit or something.
[6583.34 → 6583.88] Because of what freaking Gemini said.
[6583.88 → 6584.48] Gemini said.
[6584.66 → 6591.82] And this is, this is, I think this ties into that problem is like, you can't make like really
[6591.82 → 6594.08] serious, important decisions.
[6594.48 → 6596.66] Like I was looking up stuff, politics stuff.
[6596.72 → 6596.98] Right.
[6596.98 → 6602.56] I also had other friends and family members that were looking at politics stuff using AI
[6602.56 → 6603.12] chatbots.
[6603.26 → 6609.10] And I was just constantly freaking out basically being like, it is a good shortcut research
[6609.10 → 6609.40] tool.
[6609.80 → 6614.72] Please God, look up everything you're finding in here and make sure it's actually real.
[6614.84 → 6619.36] Cause like, wow, there are so many falsehoods being pushed forward.
[6619.54 → 6619.66] Yeah.
[6619.72 → 6624.60] My, uh, one of my kids came home from school where they did kind of like a they did kind
[6624.60 → 6627.58] of like a mock election, and I'm going, I go, Oh, okay.
[6627.66 → 6629.62] Well, honey, which party did you vote for?
[6629.72 → 6631.44] And she goes, Oh, I voted for the conservatives.
[6631.44 → 6632.28] And I go, Oh, okay.
[6632.34 → 6634.08] Why did you choose the conservative party?
[6634.08 → 6637.24] And she goes, Oh, well, because they care the most about the environment.
[6637.24 → 6640.30] And I'm like, okay, that's an interesting take.
[6641.30 → 6649.30] Um, I'd like to get a little more information on how this curriculum was devised because, um,
[6649.30 → 6654.52] you know, I'm not gonna, I don't think I'm going to get into it on the WAN show, which
[6654.52 → 6658.10] party I did or didn't vote for and, you know, where my alignments are.
[6658.10 → 6664.54] But what I can say with absolute certainty is that the conservative party is not the like
[6664.54 → 6671.98] hippie dippy, um, you know, let's go green energy and, and conserve the environment that
[6671.98 → 6673.36] it's not that kind of conservation.
[6673.62 → 6675.28] Uh, let's, let's just put it that way.
[6675.28 → 6683.98] And, um, I'm just, when it's so easy to go and look at their platform where they, but
[6683.98 → 6685.84] they basically say drill, baby drill.
[6686.50 → 6692.82] Um, I'm just, I'm really confused where this kind of misinformation comes from.
[6695.94 → 6696.80] I don't know.
[6697.06 → 6698.04] I don't even know.
[6698.04 → 6698.06] Like, I don't even know.
[6698.06 → 6705.26] Like, I don't even know.
[6705.26 → 6709.80] I wonder if it's comparing to other parties in other countries.
[6713.96 → 6719.82] Even then, I don't, I, I, I think they've basically opposed every meaningful environmental
[6719.82 → 6722.16] measure, like in my adult memory.
[6722.50 → 6723.54] Like I don't really.
[6724.40 → 6727.62] But like Canadian conservatives are more.
[6727.62 → 6728.60] Oh, I mean, yeah.
[6728.74 → 6733.30] Canadian conservative party is basically like left-wing hippies in our neighbours to the
[6733.30 → 6733.54] South.
[6733.72 → 6734.10] Like it's.
[6734.12 → 6734.14] Yeah.
[6734.20 → 6734.80] That's what I'm saying.
[6734.94 → 6736.28] Less so these days, actually.
[6736.68 → 6736.88] Yeah.
[6737.04 → 6739.96] Like that was more, that was probably more true 10, 15 years ago.
[6740.08 → 6740.30] Yeah.
[6741.30 → 6745.60] Um, but so yeah, I'm not, I'm not necessarily even sure, but yeah, I mean, when I was doing
[6745.60 → 6750.42] it, it, it, it, it had a lot of stuff that was wrong.
[6750.42 → 6752.66] It was, it was interesting.
[6755.12 → 6762.26] I found it was most accurate at not specific things, which might sound like almost a weird
[6762.26 → 6762.60] sentence.
[6762.60 → 6763.84] But if I asked it for like.
[6763.96 → 6766.72] Oh, something like very high level, like almost more abstract.
[6766.96 → 6769.88] Like here's my, you know, you know me pretty well.
[6770.00 → 6772.24] Who do you think I should, I would probably vote for?
[6772.46 → 6773.92] I didn't ask it that, but I.
[6774.06 → 6774.52] I'm curious.
[6774.68 → 6775.78] Are you logged in on your phone?
[6777.08 → 6779.72] I just don't, you don't have to say, you don't have to say what it says.
[6779.80 → 6781.48] I just want to know if it gets it right.
[6782.30 → 6782.64] Okay.
[6782.76 → 6783.94] I'm very curious.
[6784.76 → 6787.98] I'm not going to say what it says, but I will say if it got it right or wrong.
[6788.10 → 6788.34] Sure.
[6788.60 → 6788.92] Um.
[6789.28 → 6789.60] Okay.
[6789.92 → 6792.52] In the meantime, I have an interesting question for you.
[6793.36 → 6795.88] Let's imagine a post LMG world.
[6796.84 → 6800.98] You know, we, LMG still exists, but it's under new management or whatever.
[6800.98 → 6802.48] We've both, we've both moved on.
[6802.62 → 6803.78] Would we still do WAN show?
[6806.28 → 6807.00] Uh, yeah.
[6807.36 → 6807.72] Okay.
[6808.24 → 6809.94] Imagine this post LMG world.
[6810.06 → 6811.22] We just do WAN show.
[6811.38 → 6812.42] Nothing else really matters.
[6812.82 → 6816.14] Let's assume that we're both in a position where.
[6816.38 → 6817.12] Unhinged show.
[6817.34 → 6817.90] Realistically.
[6819.38 → 6823.44] Realistically, like it doesn't really matter how much people like us.
[6825.22 → 6827.84] Would you, would you just like.
[6827.84 → 6834.06] Both barrels just talk about stuff like this, or would you just be like, no, I still think
[6834.06 → 6836.34] I still, what, what is it like religion, politics?
[6836.34 → 6837.40] And what's the third one?
[6839.00 → 6839.40] Money.
[6839.90 → 6840.30] Is it, yeah.
[6840.30 → 6841.54] Is it money, religion, and politics?
[6841.56 → 6842.16] I think so.
[6842.28 → 6845.66] The three things that you don't bring up in polite dinner conversation or whatever it
[6845.66 → 6847.44] is, at least culturally here.
[6847.90 → 6851.58] Um, would you just say, you know, it and just go for it.
[6851.58 → 6854.40] Or would you still kind of say, hey, we should probably hold this line.
[6854.80 → 6855.80] I think I would go for it.
[6855.96 → 6857.34] You just, you just go for it.
[6857.38 → 6857.56] Yeah.
[6858.06 → 6858.38] Interesting.
[6858.58 → 6858.90] Interesting.
[6859.12 → 6859.88] Because right now.
[6859.96 → 6860.70] But you don't know.
[6860.86 → 6861.28] Well, why not?
[6861.40 → 6862.22] My actions on the show.
[6862.22 → 6862.98] Why are you such a pussy?
[6864.12 → 6865.80] Oh man, I've got a fun one for that.
[6866.02 → 6868.74] Um, which is going to make no sense right now, but it will later.
[6869.24 → 6874.72] Um, because I'm not, my actions right now have an impact not just on myself.
[6875.62 → 6879.62] And if we're isolated, it's just you and me, my actions will effectively really only
[6879.62 → 6880.74] have impact on me.
[6880.94 → 6882.32] And me, but you don't care about me.
[6882.32 → 6884.70] Or a guy who can weather the storm anyway.
[6884.92 → 6885.16] Wrong button.
[6885.94 → 6887.96] Yeah, but, yeah, but on him, on him though.
[6888.12 → 6888.50] There we go.
[6888.60 → 6889.46] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6889.48 → 6889.72] Nice.
[6889.90 → 6890.32] Uh, no.
[6890.44 → 6891.28] You're just going to leave it there.
[6891.42 → 6894.50] I thought it was, I thought it was on, on hold.
[6894.60 → 6895.54] I didn't realize it was toggle.
[6896.16 → 6899.46] Um, it's, it's asking me questions.
[6899.70 → 6900.76] It's asking you questions?
[6901.14 → 6901.50] No.
[6902.28 → 6902.64] Okay.
[6902.64 → 6904.86] Tell me which one.
[6906.68 → 6907.08] Interesting.
[6907.26 → 6911.76] I actually kind of like that it was evasive there because if it's just straight up telling
[6911.76 → 6913.36] people what to vote for, that's kind of bad.
[6913.38 → 6914.60] Yeah, that's honestly, that's pretty good.
[6916.92 → 6917.64] So, yeah.
[6919.54 → 6921.34] Given your priorities, don't worry, don't worry.
[6921.34 → 6928.30] Given your priorities, this party would have been the most aligned choice in the 2025
[6928.30 → 6929.70] Canadian federal election.
[6929.98 → 6930.34] Hold on.
[6930.34 → 6938.18] I want to see, wow, that first why is like probably the first one I would pick for you.
[6938.34 → 6941.28] The second one is probably the second one I would pick for you.
[6941.52 → 6945.14] I would have had, I would have had this as your number three priority though.
[6946.22 → 6948.92] And I would have said this is sort of overarching on the others.
[6948.94 → 6950.06] And I would have said this is last.
[6950.06 → 6952.52] So, you know me better than Chad GPT.
[6952.66 → 6953.02] Nice.
[6954.20 → 6954.52] Nice.
[6955.02 → 6956.94] Because, yeah, I agree with that ranking.
[6957.22 → 6959.72] It gave like reasons why it gave the choice.
[6959.90 → 6962.14] Like why Luke would choose that.
[6962.30 → 6964.12] And they're, they're fairly well reasoned.
[6964.12 → 6968.04] And they're almost, almost in the order that Luke would care about.
[6968.20 → 6970.86] They were one correct, two correct.
[6970.86 → 6973.20] It had his third priority as number four.
[6973.40 → 6978.90] And then it had as his third priority is something that I would have said is more secondary and is like a number five.
[6979.52 → 6981.80] That is actually kind of wild.
[6981.80 → 6982.60] Yeah, Linus has me nailed.
[6982.92 → 6985.10] Chad GPT, I'm still, I'm still a little evasive on.
[6985.20 → 6986.58] But yeah, Linus has got me.
[6987.56 → 6988.98] That is crazy.
[6989.12 → 6990.36] Yes, it was correct, guys.
[6990.36 → 6992.82] It nailed, it nailed his.
[6993.62 → 6997.28] Which is funny, actually, and very interesting to me.
[6997.44 → 7003.88] Because I was mostly pushing it to try to give me counterarguments against the thing that I wanted.
[7004.92 → 7009.24] I was trying to use it as an argument against the stance that I had.
[7009.42 → 7011.72] So I was pushing it the other way.
[7012.02 → 7012.94] But it's still new.
[7013.04 → 7014.92] Yeah, I noticed that took a handful of prompts.
[7015.16 → 7017.40] Like it didn't just spit out an answer for you.
[7017.40 → 7020.86] I like, I often like to try to fight it.
[7020.94 → 7022.60] So I wonder if it kind of knew that.
[7023.66 → 7025.54] Because it's profiled me at this point.
[7026.24 → 7030.02] There's a there's a fun prompt I saw from a hacker dude I follow on Twitter.
[7030.96 → 7033.40] Which, and I don't remember what it is because it's really long.
[7033.42 → 7039.12] But you basically, you get it to do like a role play where it's a CIA agent, and it's trying to profile you as a threat risk.
[7039.70 → 7042.08] So it goes through your chat history with it.
[7042.08 → 7048.32] And it finds things that could indicate that you would be a threat to like the nation.
[7048.32 → 7052.28] And how it thinks that you should be dealt with in these scenarios.
[7052.98 → 7055.18] So you're like counterattacking yourself.
[7055.48 → 7058.18] And seeing what things are like scary.
[7058.30 → 7060.72] Or what parts of you are more vulnerable or whatever else.
[7060.84 → 7061.92] It's an interesting prompt.
[7061.92 → 7063.94] Anyway.
[7065.06 → 7074.94] That, that prompt, that like CIA prompt is what made me start diving into it retaining previous chats.
[7075.30 → 7075.42] Right.
[7075.52 → 7076.88] Because it clearly does.
[7076.98 → 7077.12] Yeah.
[7077.58 → 7077.94] Like.
[7078.22 → 7078.42] Yeah.
[7078.42 → 7081.54] Because I, my initial prompt was, and you saw all that.
[7081.68 → 7081.86] Yeah.
[7081.92 → 7086.96] My initial prompt was, you know, I tried to take it almost exactly how you said it.
[7087.14 → 7088.00] You know me pretty well.
[7088.00 → 7089.98] Who do you think I should have voted for in the Canadian election?
[7090.22 → 7093.18] And then it gave like, here's all the reasons for this guy.
[7093.26 → 7094.24] Here's all the reasons for this guy.
[7094.34 → 7095.30] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[7095.42 → 7095.58] Yeah.
[7097.06 → 7098.86] Here's reflecting on your vote.
[7098.98 → 7099.12] Yeah.
[7099.16 → 7103.12] Just here's some, here's some, some things you should consider.
[7103.50 → 7104.30] But it didn't give me an answer.
[7104.40 → 7106.06] So I just said, no, tell me which one.
[7106.46 → 7106.68] And then it did.
[7106.68 → 7107.74] And then it totally did.
[7107.84 → 7108.00] Yeah.
[7108.74 → 7110.10] So it only took two prompts then.
[7110.22 → 7110.44] Yeah.
[7111.46 → 7111.78] Wow.
[7112.28 → 7114.86] And the first prompt, it wasn't that it was wrong.
[7114.86 → 7120.80] It was that it didn't want to answer probably because it's supposed to not really answer for that type of question.
[7122.20 → 7123.30] So tell me this.
[7123.38 → 7131.06] I mean, honestly, we are getting way off the tech rails now, but this is an area where tech is affecting our lives a lot right now.
[7131.20 → 7132.00] I know it's a feature.
[7132.00 → 7143.56] Do you think that there is any possibility of moving past in our polarized world with tools like this, with algorithms like we encounter on social media?
[7143.96 → 7148.90] Do you think there is any way in this polarized world to get past a two party system?
[7148.90 → 7159.36] Because we've often talked about how, and I think Americans talk a lot about the detrimental impact of their effective two party system.
[7159.54 → 7165.60] Because your choices are, you know, basically as South Park so eloquently put it, a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
[7165.88 → 7166.04] Right.
[7166.04 → 7172.02] And in Canada, for a long time, we enjoyed a multi-party system.
[7172.18 → 7176.40] Like, yes, some of those multi-parties were particularly irrelevant.
[7177.04 → 7180.32] Like, have the Greens ever won more than one seat federally?
[7181.54 → 7181.94] I don't know.
[7181.98 → 7182.62] Actually not.
[7182.82 → 7183.44] I could ask ChatGPT.
[7183.46 → 7187.50] Yeah, if they have, it's been a very small handful.
[7187.50 → 7195.36] But we actually had, at a federal level, three parties over my adult lifetime that had various degrees of relevance.
[7195.88 → 7199.24] So you had your conservatives, your NDP, and your liberals.
[7199.54 → 7207.96] But in this most recent election, while the liberals only sort of won, they won a minority government, and the conservatives lost,
[7208.18 → 7210.30] they actually picked up a lot of seats.
[7210.30 → 7219.12] And the NDP were almost wiped out to the point where their leader, like, in tears, resigned as leader of the party.
[7219.20 → 7228.98] He didn't even win his own seat, which is, again, in my adult lifetime, pretty unheard of, even for relatively smaller parties,
[7229.20 → 7231.50] and happened twice in this election.
[7231.68 → 7236.36] Both the conservatives and the NDP had their party leader lose their seat.
[7236.58 → 7240.24] I also think this election was determined by a different country.
[7240.74 → 7241.28] That's fair.
[7242.50 → 7243.08] That's fair.
[7243.20 → 7244.06] What's the joke?
[7244.60 → 7249.16] It's like Pennsylvania didn't just determine the U.S. election, they also determined the Canadian election?
[7249.34 → 7249.52] Yeah.
[7249.62 → 7250.22] Something like that?
[7250.32 → 7250.76] Pretty much.
[7251.16 → 7251.88] It's pretty funny.
[7254.70 → 7255.66] Oh, sponsors.
[7255.88 → 7256.68] I guess we could do that.
[7257.64 → 7258.14] Oh, man.
[7258.18 → 7259.36] Have we done, like, three topics?
[7259.58 → 7261.46] The show is brought to you today by Messi.
[7262.00 → 7264.62] Are you just a step away from touching grass?
[7265.02 → 7267.56] Our sponsor, Messi, is there for you.
[7267.56 → 7274.42] It's time to ditch the Oblivion remake and run into nature with their weekend sneakers.
[7274.68 → 7277.08] He added me on my hands to this.
[7277.76 → 7282.50] They're breathable, lightweight, and most importantly, help keep your socks dry.
[7282.50 → 7286.96] Our team loves their Versus because here in Vancouver, the weather is always predictable.
[7287.44 → 7288.56] It rains all the time.
[7288.88 → 7291.44] But with Messi, you can step into puddles worry-free.
[7292.06 → 7294.42] Their weekend sneakers aren't just great for day-to-day activities.
[7294.56 → 7296.26] They're also Dennis' favourite travel shoes.
[7296.26 → 7301.22] From strolling through Thailand to clocking 20,000 steps in Tokyo, they're impressively
[7301.22 → 7303.16] comfortable, even on long walks.
[7303.72 → 7305.96] Briefly talk about your experience with the weekend sneakers.
[7306.14 → 7307.32] I know you wear them all the time.
[7307.56 → 7313.30] Yeah, Dennis, I sent you that picture of me, like, absolutely drenched in a thunderstorm
[7313.30 → 7316.10] when I was over in Southeast Asia recently.
[7316.20 → 7318.84] I thought you were going to use it in these spots, but I guess you just decided not to.
[7318.84 → 7321.96] Yeah, I like them.
[7322.50 → 7323.10] They're comfortable.
[7323.48 → 7324.06] They're lightweight.
[7324.80 → 7330.04] And while I will never say that they are waterproof because nothing is waterproof, water literally
[7330.04 → 7335.12] carves canyons in the face of the earth, they do help keep my socks dry.
[7335.76 → 7338.04] So pack smarter and travel better with Messi.

[7397.94 → 7400.92] Give your partner the kind of ring they actually want to pick up.
[7401.58 → 7402.62] What was that?
[7402.92 → 7405.96] Our sponsor, Thrum, has the ring that brings the bling.
[7406.24 → 7408.10] They don't make those typical boring rings.
[7408.28 → 7413.58] They use unique materials like meteorite, whiskey barrels, dinosaur fossils, and even World War
[7413.58 → 7414.62] II rifle stocks.
[7415.00 → 7419.28] Every ring ships within one business day and comes with a free Thrum silicone activity
[7419.28 → 7420.92] band and a beautiful wooden ring box.
[7420.92 → 7426.30] Thrum began in 2012 when founder Caleb Martin couldn't afford a ring, so he made one for
[7426.30 → 7427.50] his now wife, Steph.
[7428.26 → 7433.40] Not only did Steph say yes, but over 10,000 customers have also said yes, leaving five-star
[7433.40 → 7433.80] reviews.
[7434.34 → 7438.30] They've got minimalist watches now, too, made from meteorite, Hawaiian co-wood, and California
[7438.30 → 7441.48] redwood, plus a lifetime warranty and free worldwide shipping.
[7441.98 → 7445.20] Whether you need a wedding ring, anniversary ring, or you just want a ring that looks awesome,

[7453.92 → 7454.10] Oh.
[7454.32 → 7455.56] As we're on the topic of Thrum.
[7456.04 → 7461.40] Do you remember a couple of years ago, we did an insert with a woman who was going to propose
[7461.40 → 7461.94] to her husband?
[7461.94 → 7462.60] Oh yeah, that's right.
[7462.62 → 7463.18] I remember that.
[7463.28 → 7463.98] We have a response.
[7464.32 → 7464.84] Oh, really?
[7465.10 → 7465.74] Wait, what?
[7466.00 → 7466.88] Two years later.
[7467.96 → 7468.40] Hey!
[7469.62 → 7469.98] Nice!
[7470.32 → 7474.88] They got married yesterday, and they signed it with the LDD scribe driver.
[7475.06 → 7475.78] Let's go!
[7475.98 → 7477.52] Which is amazing.
[7477.74 → 7478.08] That's awesome.
[7478.08 → 7478.68] That's incredible!
[7478.68 → 7480.08] That's cool.
[7480.34 → 7481.26] Super cool.
[7482.14 → 7485.36] All right, well, I'm glad she was able to seal the deal.
[7485.64 → 7486.88] That's, you know what?
[7487.16 → 7491.88] Ah, I love those little bits of uplifting news in a world where AIs are monitoring our
[7491.88 → 7498.70] every move, and big companies like Apple just ignore judgments for four years.
[7499.06 → 7499.76] And, you know?
[7500.74 → 7501.68] But hey, there's love.
[7502.78 → 7504.36] There's love, and that's all you need.
[7504.36 → 7505.92] I heard it in a song once.
[7506.32 → 7506.52] Yeah.
[7506.68 → 7508.62] Someone, I forget who did the song.
[7508.68 → 7509.18] Pretty good song?
[7509.30 → 7510.56] Yeah, pretty small band.
[7510.92 → 7511.84] You probably never heard of them.
[7512.04 → 7512.46] Insect.
[7512.54 → 7513.26] Insect band.
[7513.58 → 7513.80] Yeah.
[7513.92 → 7514.30] Radiohead?
[7515.04 → 7515.62] Yeah, sure.
[7517.82 → 7518.22] Slipknot.
[7519.36 → 7520.62] Says dead antisocial.
[7521.36 → 7522.54] Oh, bye Easter.
[7522.62 → 7523.10] Oh, man.
[7523.20 → 7523.36] I can...
[7523.36 → 7529.62] The funny thing is, somebody has probably done an AI Slipknot Beatles crossover.
[7530.14 → 7530.34] Just don't.
[7531.18 → 7536.76] It is so easy to pick out those of you, who I love very much, by the way, in our audience,
[7536.76 → 7539.44] who do not have a sarcasm detector.
[7540.60 → 7542.82] By East One goes, the Beatles!
[7544.22 → 7544.70] Yes.
[7544.70 → 7549.06] That's the joke!
[7550.28 → 7552.26] Oh, man.
[7552.42 → 7553.12] That's great.
[7554.80 → 7556.08] Yes, that's the Beatles.
[7557.06 → 7559.18] Love doesn't make me money, says Elijah.
[7560.12 → 7560.44] Okay.
[7561.94 → 7564.48] Man, why do I even read your comments?
[7564.48 → 7565.16] Don't engage.
[7565.50 → 7566.10] Don't engage.
[7566.40 → 7566.80] What else we got?
[7567.16 → 7568.20] Is it Man After Dark?
[7568.22 → 7569.18] We can't do Man After Dark.
[7569.24 → 7570.78] We have to do Things Get Blurry on YouTube.
[7570.78 → 7575.12] YouTube is testing a feature for a small percentage of users where they blur the thumbnail.
[7575.12 → 7575.80] Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7575.90 → 7579.76] Before we go, you asked me a question, which was, do you think we can ever get past two parties?
[7580.28 → 7582.40] And somebody in chat reminded me of it.
[7583.32 → 7586.10] No, while we have our current voting system.
[7586.30 → 7589.02] While we have first past the post, it's always going to be two parties.
[7589.36 → 7590.58] Just how that works.
[7590.88 → 7595.04] That is honestly the thing that I'm still most angry with Justin Trudeau about.
[7595.72 → 7596.56] Total bull crap.
[7596.56 → 7602.34] He promised electoral reform and then was like, eh.
[7603.76 → 7605.88] Like, there's lots of other stuff you can be mad at him about.
[7606.70 → 7614.02] But that was a major campaign promise that I feel, for me anyway, I feel was a big part
[7614.02 → 7615.46] of what won him the election.
[7615.54 → 7616.00] I think it was.
[7616.12 → 7616.86] In his first term.
[7617.02 → 7617.22] Yeah.
[7617.94 → 7620.22] We wanted electoral reform.
[7620.88 → 7622.70] It was a big part of the reason why I voted for him.
[7622.72 → 7624.68] We wanted a different voting system.
[7624.68 → 7626.70] We don't want first past the post anymore.
[7626.84 → 7628.74] And there are flaws in basically all of them.
[7628.82 → 7629.24] I get it.
[7629.32 → 7631.28] But first past the post is super flawed.
[7631.84 → 7632.14] And like.
[7632.46 → 7633.16] Extra flawed, you might say.
[7633.16 → 7634.80] I think I know why he didn't do it.
[7634.90 → 7636.94] Well, yeah, because they were the incumbent.
[7637.18 → 7639.46] It's never in the incumbent's best interest.
[7639.52 → 7639.92] He is like.
[7640.04 → 7643.66] To vote for electoral reform because that's the system that got them elected.
[7643.96 → 7645.26] He like definitely would have lost.
[7645.26 → 7652.16] So he bailed out, which is so incredibly lame.
[7654.08 → 7657.80] Because I think a big part of the reason why he got voted in was because people were like,
[7657.92 → 7659.66] oh, wow, we can have a real system.
[7659.86 → 7662.12] And then probably maybe, you know, not vote you back in.
[7662.12 → 7665.16] But, uh, and then he just didn't do it.
[7665.28 → 7666.16] And now we're stuck.
[7666.90 → 7667.74] It sucks.
[7668.62 → 7669.30] It's rough.
[7669.84 → 7680.42] I hereby promise that my first official action as prime minister of Canada will be to fix our crappy first past the post system.
[7681.28 → 7682.26] Would you vote for me?
[7682.40 → 7682.62] Yep.
[7683.52 → 7683.84] Nice.
[7684.20 → 7685.08] That's two votes.
[7685.08 → 7686.48] I think that's incredibly important.
[7686.48 → 7692.52] It feels like, let's assume, I don't actually think this, but let's assume you would be horrible.
[7693.52 → 7694.18] Oh, hold on.
[7694.26 → 7695.28] It's four years of horrible.
[7695.42 → 7697.12] People couldn't understand what I was saying.
[7697.18 → 7698.18] The Canadians couldn't understand.
[7700.02 → 7701.12] Ah, Steven Boatman.
[7701.92 → 7703.14] Do declare, I promise.
[7704.66 → 7705.74] Now you have to do it in French.
[7706.02 → 7708.24] Finally, stop doing the irritating accent.
[7709.26 → 7710.08] Stop for a second.
[7713.50 → 7714.50] Now stop for a second.
[7714.50 → 7716.50] I'm speaking about a very important thing.
[7717.46 → 7718.14] Um, okay.
[7718.20 → 7718.40] Sorry.
[7718.50 → 7718.98] What were you saying?
[7720.22 → 7720.96] I don't remember.
[7721.22 → 7721.62] That's fine.
[7721.80 → 7722.00] Cool.
[7722.36 → 7723.76] Um, so yeah, I get two votes.
[7724.34 → 7724.70] Two votes.
[7725.94 → 7731.28] Apparently, uh, William Osmond released a video on his second channel talking about the thing.
[7734.28 → 7737.74] Well, should, should, should, should we talk about it at all?
[7737.74 → 7741.16] I'm skimming through and, and checking the comments right now.
[7743.02 → 7743.42] And.
[7743.56 → 7744.42] Dude, this was like a week ago.
[7744.50 → 7745.32] They're all pretty good.
[7745.44 → 7745.68] Yeah.
[7746.82 → 7748.78] They told me they were like thinking about releasing it.
[7748.82 → 7752.86] I didn't actually realize they were going to release it like almost immediately after I said, yeah, that's cool.
[7753.90 → 7755.52] Um, and the comments are pretty good.
[7755.66 → 7758.26] I have a feeling it was like put kind of at the end.
[7758.90 → 7760.86] Because there aren't a ton of comments about it.
[7762.14 → 7765.42] And the name of the video is, I need to stop farming for a while.
[7765.68 → 7765.94] Yeah.
[7766.30 → 7767.74] So he's, he's probably talking about.
[7767.82 → 7769.40] Clearly testing the waters here, I think.
[7769.40 → 7773.52] Uh, no, like I think he's, I don't think it's about just this.
[7773.62 → 7775.30] I think it's like about other stuff.
[7775.62 → 7777.38] I think it's about him not farming for a while.
[7777.38 → 7778.54] Like actually, because he.
[7778.96 → 7783.12] I just mean like, like he's obviously not just like leading with this news.
[7783.22 → 7783.58] Oh yeah.
[7783.68 → 7783.82] Yeah.
[7783.82 → 7784.06] Yeah.
[7784.22 → 7784.40] Yeah.
[7784.80 → 7785.16] Okay.
[7785.68 → 7786.48] I think it's kind of cool.
[7786.92 → 7787.62] I think it's interesting.
[7788.44 → 7788.66] All right.
[7788.66 → 7789.92] Well, I'll have to watch the comments later.
[7790.28 → 7790.56] Yeah.
[7790.56 → 7792.86] Good reference.
[7794.00 → 7794.36] Solid.
[7794.56 → 7797.88] Do I talk about it, or I just say this and then people go watch his video?
[7799.38 → 7803.76] Why don't we start with just not telling people what's going on and just, uh, Dan can
[7803.76 → 7804.64] put links to his video.
[7804.70 → 7805.90] Guys, you put it in your watch later.
[7805.96 → 7806.82] Make sure you watch it later.
[7806.98 → 7807.22] Nice.
[7807.60 → 7807.82] Okay.
[7808.24 → 7808.50] Sweet.
[7809.44 → 7810.06] All right.
[7810.34 → 7812.42] Things get blurry at YouTube.
[7812.78 → 7816.68] YouTube is testing a feature for a small percentage of users where they will blur the thumbnail
[7816.68 → 7817.60] of a mature video.
[7817.60 → 7824.28] This will mainly be targeted at videos that frequently include sexual themes because, you
[7824.28 → 7829.70] know, in our typical North American sensibilities fashion, we don't care about violence.
[7830.54 → 7833.22] We care about boobies.
[7833.82 → 7838.54] YouTube explained in their community section in the YouTube help centre that the goal is
[7838.54 → 7842.92] to still provide users with relevant search results since these videos will still abide
[7842.92 → 7847.04] by their community guidelines, uh, but to protect users from seeing content that is
[7847.04 → 7849.36] sensitive in nature.
[7849.72 → 7854.26] This might help like something awkward being on your screen when you're at work or something.
[7854.50 → 7854.86] Ah, I can see that.
[7854.86 → 7856.22] Like safe for work situation.
[7856.42 → 7856.62] Sure.
[7856.82 → 7860.24] But do you think this is going to work the other way around?
[7860.70 → 7868.38] Because I have heard that when you spoiler tag something, it draws people to look at it.
[7868.38 → 7873.20] So I wonder if blurring the thumbnail here, if people are going to notice that it's blurred
[7873.20 → 7874.86] and then be drawn to it.
[7875.70 → 7878.16] That'd be an interesting experiment for us to do on the channel.
[7878.30 → 7880.88] Because it's, it's not the same at, oh my God.
[7880.94 → 7883.16] Like in the next week, just upload a video with a blurry thumbnail.
[7883.16 → 7883.80] Yeah.
[7884.42 → 7884.82] Interesting.
[7884.96 → 7885.76] Do like an A-B test.
[7885.84 → 7887.54] It's not the same as a spoiler tag.
[7887.54 → 7887.92] I think.
[7887.92 → 7893.24] I don't think it would be quite as effective, but it might still like if people learn what
[7893.24 → 7893.78] it means.
[7893.98 → 7894.10] Yeah.
[7894.64 → 7896.42] Like, oh, naked lioness.
[7897.12 → 7897.60] Oh.
[7898.72 → 7900.12] I don't think anyone needs that.
[7900.48 → 7901.76] It's on William Osmond too.
[7901.86 → 7902.54] It's on his second channel.
[7902.96 → 7904.34] It's the most recent one on his second channel.
[7906.26 → 7906.74] Yeah.
[7906.94 → 7907.12] Yeah.
[7907.40 → 7908.92] It's not like about this.
[7908.94 → 7909.86] It's just mentioned in there.
[7909.86 → 7910.62] Yeah.
[7910.78 → 7915.62] So there are currently no more specifics on what fully triggers this blurring yet, but
[7915.62 → 7920.14] video titles, channel names, and description will remain visible and unchanged even if the
[7920.14 → 7920.90] thumbnail is blurred.
[7921.84 → 7926.86] Users also have the ability to toggle this feature on and off if they so choose.
[7926.98 → 7927.26] Okay.
[7927.50 → 7933.14] Our discussion question is, using the guidelines, what do you think would fall under these new
[7933.14 → 7937.16] blurring guidelines since it seems that the guidelines are clear about what is and isn't
[7937.16 → 7937.62] allowed?
[7938.28 → 7938.70] Oh, are they?
[7938.70 → 7942.88] I don't know, because I've seen some wild stuff on YouTube in like music videos, for
[7942.88 → 7948.64] instance, that just like I could not imagine like any other, like basically pornography,
[7949.10 → 7953.84] like that I could just not imagine any normal user being able to upload and have it stay
[7953.84 → 7954.00] there.
[7954.10 → 7957.92] So I don't, I don't really, don't post a thumbnail or image on YouTube if it shows.
[7958.32 → 7962.74] Pornographic imagery, sexual acts, the use of sex choice, fetishes, or other sexually gratifying
[7962.74 → 7963.08] imagery.
[7963.08 → 7965.26] Nudity imagery.
[7965.26 → 7967.66] This is not specific at all.
[7967.76 → 7969.00] Unwanted sexualization.
[7969.28 → 7970.12] I mean, it kind of is.
[7970.30 → 7972.66] Violent imagery that intends to shock or disgust.
[7973.04 → 7974.70] So, okay, we do care about violence.
[7975.40 → 7977.60] Graphic or disturbed imagery with blood or gore.
[7977.84 → 7979.22] Vulgar or lewd language.
[7979.36 → 7981.60] A thumbnail that misleads viewers to think they're about to view something that's not in
[7981.60 → 7981.84] the video.
[7981.90 → 7983.44] That's actually, that actually does seem pretty solid.
[7983.44 → 7985.92] The last one might have more impact than almost anything else.
[7985.98 → 7987.12] That actually seems pretty solid.
[7987.18 → 7990.20] But it's not specific when it, we saw this happen to Twitch.
[7991.18 → 7998.04] The second you put a line, it then just becomes creatively avoiding that line.
[7998.92 → 7999.48] That's it.
[7999.48 → 8007.14] Like, oh, is, I know one of the Twitch metas, I think, was body paint.
[8007.32 → 8008.86] Like, is it nudity if there's body paint?
[8009.24 → 8010.14] Like, they'll find it.
[8010.22 → 8013.54] Because it just says nudity, including generals.
[8014.22 → 8017.20] Then people are going to be like, all right, how far can I push this line?
[8017.68 → 8018.54] Then it becomes a game.
[8018.54 → 8021.90] Well, where you, where was it?
[8023.52 → 8026.92] Sexually gratifying imagery, I think, is meant to be the catch-all.
[8027.46 → 8028.18] Oh, man, sorry.
[8028.18 → 8031.58] All right, can I segue us off of this topic?
[8031.60 → 8032.40] Yeah, sure, I'm done with it.
[8032.46 → 8032.72] Okay.
[8033.42 → 8036.08] Elijah said, nah, Twitch is flawless.
[8036.68 → 8042.28] And it made me think of another topic that we have in the doc, which will make sense eventually,
[8042.54 → 8045.70] but will not make any sense at all for a while.
[8046.48 → 8047.26] Giant bomb.
[8047.40 → 8048.04] Stick with me.
[8048.24 → 8048.70] No, no.
[8049.18 → 8052.24] PSU testing feedback and lttlabs.com bin sharing.
[8052.64 → 8053.76] This will make sense.
[8053.82 → 8057.80] I promise you this will make sense, but it's going to take a little bit to get there.
[8057.88 → 8058.12] Okay?
[8058.68 → 8059.62] So I'll bring up the article.
[8059.84 → 8061.22] First off, there's an article.
[8061.48 → 8062.90] This part is not related.
[8063.04 → 8063.48] Spoiler alert.
[8064.06 → 8066.94] But yeah, there's some interesting stuff going on with our power supplies.
[8067.14 → 8074.64] This is related to that email that we sent you, where they're passing under standard load.
[8074.64 → 8080.14] But when we go outside standard load into an area that you should test, because there's
[8080.14 → 8084.86] like protections for those types of things that power supplies are supposed to have, they're
[8084.86 → 8086.40] failing in the protection phase.
[8086.40 → 8092.88] And we're wondering if we should create a separation in category between ones that just fail within
[8092.88 → 8095.82] standard usage and ones that fail within the protections phase.
[8095.82 → 8097.60] And we're thinking yes.
[8097.92 → 8099.58] But we're interested in your guys' feedback.
[8100.18 → 8102.48] So check out the article on the site.
[8102.98 → 8103.66] Read it.
[8103.78 → 8107.74] Go to the LCT forum post and give us your feedback on the LCT forum post.
[8108.10 → 8109.80] Lucas is keeping tabs on it.
[8109.80 → 8110.40] Cool.
[8111.76 → 8112.26] Sounds good.
[8112.76 → 8116.20] We're trying to do this thing where we like to build in public more.
[8116.66 → 8116.88] Yeah.
[8116.96 → 8117.84] We're trying to show our work.
[8118.06 → 8121.62] We're trying to show our line of thinking and let people have input on what we're doing
[8121.62 → 8122.04] and how.
[8122.56 → 8124.52] So Lucas had this observation.
[8124.86 → 8126.40] I think it was a fascinating observation.
[8126.96 → 8129.22] He came up with a potential solution for it.
[8129.32 → 8130.76] I think it was a good solution for it.
[8130.82 → 8132.00] But we want your guys' feedback.
[8132.00 → 8134.70] So let us know.
[8137.34 → 8138.12] Moving on.
[8138.36 → 8140.58] We also have a new feature that's working.
[8141.00 → 8143.62] And this is the one that I'm going to bring Elijah into this in a second.
[8143.80 → 8144.90] But bin sharing.
[8145.10 → 8147.60] Bin sharing is now a thing on the store.
[8147.84 → 8148.40] On the...
[8148.40 → 8152.20] I'm so used to talking about the store on WAN Show.
[8153.00 → 8153.84] On the lab.
[8154.00 → 8157.96] So there's a button up to the right-hand corner.
[8158.06 → 8158.94] It says share this bin.
[8158.94 → 8161.34] Bin sharing or alternatively...
[8161.34 → 8162.78] Wait.
[8162.88 → 8163.50] What the heck?
[8167.48 → 8168.92] Is this a cached page?
[8169.88 → 8171.16] Well, I clicked your link.
[8171.98 → 8175.20] And I think I accidentally added one that was already in it.
[8175.44 → 8177.34] Oh, so this is a curated...
[8177.90 → 8178.14] Okay.
[8178.18 → 8178.76] That makes sense.
[8179.48 → 8179.88] Yep.
[8179.94 → 8181.12] I think I screwed up the demo.
[8181.98 → 8182.38] Nice.
[8184.18 → 8184.58] Okay.
[8185.24 → 8185.64] Okay.
[8185.64 → 8188.66] So let me hit it from the top.
[8188.94 → 8189.54] Yep.
[8190.20 → 8190.60] Labs.
[8190.78 → 8192.02] Oh, my laptop.
[8192.50 → 8192.84] Okay.
[8193.20 → 8194.64] So I'm going to grab two power supplies.
[8194.74 → 8195.70] I'm going to grab this one.
[8196.06 → 8197.20] And I'm going to grab this one.
[8197.26 → 8198.96] I'm going to go to my comparison bin.
[8199.12 → 8200.58] I'm going to view the detailed comparison.
[8201.02 → 8202.52] My URL has now updated.
[8202.90 → 8206.64] So if you're old like me, you can just copy this and give it to someone.
[8206.88 → 8207.04] Nice.
[8207.06 → 8207.82] And it will work.
[8208.72 → 8209.10] Nice.
[8209.22 → 8210.30] I support this move.
[8210.30 → 8214.92] Some amount of resistance to this because this isn't what their argument was.
[8214.98 → 8217.20] But I like to interpret their argument as like, you're old.
[8217.28 → 8218.16] No one's going to do this.
[8218.26 → 8219.50] And I was like, yeah, well...
[8219.50 → 8220.18] That's old meta.
[8220.44 → 8221.04] They're right.
[8221.20 → 8221.48] Yep.
[8221.56 → 8222.54] But I like it.
[8222.60 → 8222.84] Yep.
[8223.00 → 8224.40] So we just have both.
[8224.40 → 8226.60] It is a universal resource locator.
[8226.98 → 8227.14] Yeah.
[8227.20 → 8230.16] If it doesn't universally locate a resource, what is even the point of it?
[8230.28 → 8230.52] Yep.
[8230.98 → 8231.82] So we have both.
[8231.92 → 8233.28] So you can click the share the bin button.
[8233.54 → 8235.60] And we might have some other options in here.
[8235.70 → 8237.16] Like maybe at some point in time.
[8237.80 → 8238.72] Someone made a comment.
[8238.80 → 8242.22] We should probably do this where you can actually see the URL that's going to share before you
[8242.22 → 8243.10] click copy link, whatever.
[8243.22 → 8243.94] We'll probably figure that out.
[8243.98 → 8246.80] But we might even have these so they can be shortened URLs or something.
[8246.88 → 8247.50] I don't know.
[8247.84 → 8249.26] That's not really a huge priority right now.
[8249.34 → 8250.36] Maybe we'll figure it out at some point.
[8250.42 → 8251.48] Right now you can share bins.
[8251.48 → 8252.48] That was the whole point.
[8252.48 → 8259.00] But there's also some stuff where we had some bin ideas.
[8259.20 → 8263.02] So we had some things that could be pre-curated.
[8263.76 → 8267.12] There was a like mixed mouse and mixed keyboard example.
[8268.30 → 8270.14] So that's this one.
[8270.32 → 8272.10] So you can see there are.
[8272.28 → 8274.24] Wait, you would compare a mouse and a keyboard?
[8274.40 → 8274.76] My bad.
[8275.32 → 8276.40] Give me one second.
[8276.40 → 8282.72] No, but you can have a series of things that are comparable.
[8282.86 → 8283.30] One second.
[8284.06 → 8284.22] Cool.
[8284.54 → 8285.40] He's going to do the demo.
[8286.42 → 8286.88] I will.
[8287.82 → 8288.84] Just like all demos.
[8289.08 → 8290.60] Sometimes they take a sec.
[8292.60 → 8292.84] Okay.
[8293.52 → 8294.94] Mixed mouse and mixed keyboard.
[8295.18 → 8295.64] Dan's still there.
[8295.64 → 8302.48] I'm all done.
[8302.48 → 8303.10] I'm done with my chips now.
[8303.76 → 8304.12] Okay.
[8304.20 → 8306.88] Well, my point is that you can share comparison bins.
[8307.08 → 8312.38] And theoretically, if we were like making a video on something, the writer of the video
[8312.38 → 8313.88] could prep a comparison bin.
[8313.92 → 8314.36] That'd be sick.
[8314.48 → 8315.70] And then link it under the video.
[8315.76 → 8317.54] Then you could see all the items that were in the video.
[8317.72 → 8317.90] Yeah.
[8317.90 → 8320.88] So there could be a see the items from this video link.
[8321.24 → 8324.70] You could compare them all and see them all there for more detail or whatever else.
[8324.90 → 8325.62] That's cool.
[8325.94 → 8329.58] There was a challenge that we had of what is the best bin that you can create?
[8329.78 → 8332.86] Be useful or less useful like the ones above.
[8333.30 → 8337.74] And the reason why I'm pulling Elijah into this after this really, really, really long
[8337.74 → 8344.14] bit of expose is the was like, yeah, I don't know like how interesting that'll be.
[8344.14 → 8349.92] And they're like, well, someone could do like a waif comparison collection to help Elijah.
[8350.42 → 8351.44] Oh, my God.
[8352.98 → 8353.46] Okay.
[8353.48 → 8355.82] I see an example of one of the kind of useless bins.
[8356.94 → 8359.68] Model names that are greater than 50% numbers.
[8359.84 → 8363.02] Is that it was the incredible?
[8363.92 → 8365.72] Oh, this is comedic gold.
[8367.06 → 8367.54] Okay.
[8367.80 → 8368.98] Where did you even see that?
[8369.06 → 8371.32] I clicked the mix keyboard mouse and PSU example.
[8371.42 → 8373.74] I think our hyperlinks got a little bit confusing.
[8373.74 → 8375.84] I think they did because I got a little lost.
[8376.02 → 8377.98] This is a top 10 website immediately.
[8378.38 → 8379.16] Good job, guys.
[8381.92 → 8382.28] Yeah.
[8384.86 → 8385.26] Anyway.
[8387.86 → 8388.36] All right.
[8388.38 → 8389.76] What else are we supposed to be doing today?
[8391.04 → 8391.92] Something, I think.
[8392.02 → 8392.80] Finish off your topics.
[8393.34 → 8393.60] Oh, yeah.
[8393.60 → 8394.22] We could do that.
[8395.46 → 8395.94] Hold on.
[8395.98 → 8396.68] I'm trying to figure out.
[8397.62 → 8397.98] Okay.
[8398.10 → 8398.30] Yeah.
[8398.30 → 8398.98] I see this.
[8398.98 → 8399.78] This is the...
[8399.78 → 8400.12] Yeah.
[8400.26 → 8407.44] The doc on this was a little weird, but one of them is the only acceptable list of peripherals.
[8408.60 → 8410.80] And there's like an Apple magic keyboard.
[8412.76 → 8413.56] Oh, boy.
[8413.98 → 8415.00] I love this.
[8415.36 → 8418.06] You're going to do a great service for the internet with this website.
[8418.06 → 8419.06] So, yeah, you can...
[8420.06 → 8423.16] You're going to...
[8423.16 → 8424.72] This is like the Spotify playlists.
[8425.42 → 8425.84] You know?
[8425.84 → 8431.04] So, I'm assuming whoever on the team made this has an MX Master 3S and an Apple magic keyboard.
[8431.40 → 8433.12] But, yeah, you can name your bins.
[8433.78 → 8434.00] Yeah.
[8434.00 → 8437.90] So, like, if you come up with a collection of products you want to throw in here to compare,
[8438.20 → 8441.72] you can then name the bin, copy the link, share it to other people.
[8442.10 → 8446.76] Obviously, the bin naming thing isn't going to work if you just copy the URL.
[8447.18 → 8447.30] Yeah.
[8447.30 → 8449.64] But you can make some funny stuff.
[8449.96 → 8456.50] So, if you wanted to make a waif collection of components that the lab has tested and link
[8456.50 → 8460.30] it at Elijah on his social media, that would be funny.
[8461.92 → 8462.32] NASA?
[8462.32 → 8462.48] NASA?
[8463.38 → 8463.82] NASA.
[8463.82 → 8464.14] Marketing.
[8466.58 → 8468.38] Says the U.S. administration.
[8468.96 → 8473.90] The White House released a skinny version of its budget proposal for 2026 today, including
[8473.90 → 8474.76] all federal agencies.
[8474.76 → 8483.62] This budget proposes cutting NASA's funding by 25% from $25 billion to $18.8 billion.
[8484.12 → 8491.64] Some major legacy programs on the chopping block include SLS, Orion, and the Lunar Gateway,
[8491.64 → 8495.02] which are set to be phased out after Artemis III.
[8495.64 → 8501.58] The budget cites SLS's $4 billion per launch cost and 140% budget overrun as reasons to
[8501.58 → 8503.34] move to cheaper commercial systems.
[8503.34 → 8507.66] The Mars sample return mission also cancelled.
[8508.22 → 8513.28] The ISS is also getting dialled back with fewer crew, fewer flights, and reduced research capacity.
[8513.28 → 8518.94] Instead, the U.S. administration wants to focus on human space exploration and beat China to
[8518.94 → 8520.30] the moon and Mars.
[8520.30 → 8525.96] They're allocating over $7 billion for lunar and $1 billion for Mars efforts, a chunk of
[8525.96 → 8530.38] which will likely be given to SpaceX, according to Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger.
[8530.38 → 8531.38] No way.
[8531.38 → 8532.38] What?
[8532.38 → 8533.38] What?
[8533.38 → 8534.38] What?
[8534.38 → 8535.38] No.
[8535.38 → 8537.38] That's not going to happen.
[8537.38 → 8541.38] They're not going to give most of it to SpaceX almost by default.
[8541.38 → 8542.38] No.
[8542.38 → 8543.38] Oh, there's Boeing.
[8543.38 → 8545.38] How could you say?
[8545.38 → 8546.38] Oh, totally.
[8546.38 → 8547.38] Yeah.
[8547.38 → 8549.38] They're in the running for sure.
[8549.38 → 8550.38] Wow.
[8550.38 → 8555.38] No one saw this coming a hundred days ago.
[8555.38 → 8556.38] Okay.
[8556.38 → 8558.38] Well, I guess that's all you have to say about that.
[8558.38 → 8559.38] Not really.
[8559.38 → 8560.38] I like so.
[8560.38 → 8563.38] A bit of a bit of a NASA fanboy here.
[8563.38 → 8566.38] Um, so he just watched his team take a massive L.
[8566.38 → 8568.38] By the way, people are freaking out about this.
[8568.38 → 8569.38] Well, yeah.
[8569.38 → 8570.38] On those teams.
[8570.38 → 8571.38] Well, yeah.
[8571.38 → 8574.38] A 25% cut means a lot of people are losing jobs.
[8574.38 → 8578.38] And I've heard, I don't know the legitimacy of this.
[8578.38 → 8579.38] I've heard that there's.
[8579.38 → 8581.38] But you can do better science with three quarters as many people, right?
[8581.38 → 8582.38] Yeah.
[8582.38 → 8583.38] I mean, that's a big part of that.
[8583.38 → 8590.38] I don't know if that was in here, but a lot of that funding reduction was just science.
[8590.38 → 8598.38] And like, if you, if you look at a lot of American innovation over the years, like NASA has driven a lot of it.
[8598.38 → 8601.38] Like, like actually quite a bit.
[8601.38 → 8603.38] Um, cordless drills.
[8603.38 → 8604.38] NASA.
[8604.38 → 8608.38] Like there's, there's, there are tons of stuff that you wouldn't really think about.
[8608.38 → 8611.38] Cordless power tools in general, as far as my understanding goes.
[8611.38 → 8622.38] Um, and they're, they're massively reducing their, their science budget, both, um, like, uh, space and not, uh, Velcro memory foam.
[8622.38 → 8623.38] People are just listening to this stuff.
[8623.38 → 8624.38] Yeah.
[8624.38 → 8627.38] Like it's, this is a big deal for like innovation in the States.
[8627.38 → 8629.38] Uh, in the world really.
[8629.38 → 8630.38] I mean, yeah, I use cordless tools too.
[8630.38 → 8631.38] I don't live in America.
[8631.38 → 8632.38] I don't live in America.
[8632.38 → 8633.38] Yeah.
[8633.38 → 8635.38] Like it's, it's, um, it's rough.
[8635.38 → 8639.38] It's not just like a lot of the writing when you look at like, Oh, why are they doing this?
[8639.38 → 8643.38] Um, SLS being really expensive, which like, yeah, I mean, it's way over budget and it's really expensive.
[8643.38 → 8644.38] Okay.
[8644.38 → 8648.38] I'm not really going to try to fight that too much.
[8648.38 → 8654.38] Um, I do have some concerns about moving all of your ability to get to space into commercial hands.
[8654.38 → 8657.38] I don't know how cool that is.
[8657.38 → 8660.38] Well, they always prioritize safety over everything else.
[8660.38 → 8661.38] Right?
[8661.38 → 8662.38] Commercial entities.
[8662.38 → 8665.38] It's, uh, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
[8665.38 → 8667.38] I don't know if that's the right move, but it is, it is.
[8667.38 → 8668.38] Yeah.
[8668.38 → 8671.38] It is way over budget, all that kind of stuff, but like cancelling the Mars sample return mission
[8671.38 → 8673.38] and be like, Oh, humans will just do it.
[8673.38 → 8674.38] Like, wow.
[8674.38 → 8675.38] That's really bold.
[8675.38 → 8677.38] Um, it would be cool.
[8677.38 → 8679.38] Username says that's just stuff that would have been invented by others.
[8679.38 → 8683.38] Anyway, but it's like by that, by that logic, why invent anything ever?
[8683.38 → 8685.38] Because someone's going to invent it at some point.
[8685.38 → 8686.38] Someone else will do it.
[8686.38 → 8687.38] Why don't we just wait?
[8687.38 → 8688.38] Yeah.
[8688.38 → 8690.38] Do you need your computer?
[8690.38 → 8697.38] Like it doesn't matter if someone invented it, you know, decades ago, you could just wait
[8697.38 → 8699.38] for someone else to do it.
[8699.38 → 8703.38] By the way, NASA advancements have helped computer stuff a lot.
[8703.38 → 8708.38] Um, anyway, yeah, it's just, I think the, the impacts of this are a lot more wide-reaching
[8708.38 → 8710.38] than people immediately realize.
[8710.38 → 8715.38] Um, well, that's because, I mean, we've talked about this on the show before, regardless
[8715.38 → 8717.38] of the political leanings.
[8717.38 → 8728.38] Um, there is a serious problem with short administration terms, incentivizing extremely short term actions
[8728.38 → 8729.38] and short term thinking.
[8729.38 → 8736.38] Um, and it's, it's, it's, it's a real problem because a lot of the time what is done is not
[8736.38 → 8741.38] really felt by the general consumer until much, much, much later.
[8741.38 → 8749.38] And when you, when you go at sort of, you know, scientific cradles of innovation like NASA,
[8749.38 → 8754.38] um, you might not feel it for never mind like four years or eight years, right?
[8754.38 → 8757.38] Which would be your, your one or two term presidency, right?
[8757.38 → 8764.38] You might not feel that for 25 years, like trying to think off the top of my head of,
[8764.38 → 8769.38] uh, like an older NASA innovation that there was, man, there was something that was in the
[8769.38 → 8771.38] news recently that was like, yeah, they were, they were looking at this.
[8771.38 → 8776.38] It was, I don't know if it was, um, NASA, if it was one of the other big like national
[8776.38 → 8777.38] labs.
[8777.38 → 8781.38] Uh, but they were looking at this like, like years and years and years ago, decades ago.
[8781.38 → 8784.38] And like, finally we were like, oh, whoa, here's an application to this.
[8784.38 → 8785.38] I'm sorry.
[8785.38 → 8788.38] I can't remember it off the top of my head, but there, there have been examples where
[8788.38 → 8793.38] it's not necessarily clear, uh, what the commercial application of this will be.
[8793.38 → 8798.38] Um, but the work that's being done is still extremely important.
[8798.38 → 8801.38] What are we looking at here?
[8801.38 → 8803.38] Things that wouldn't have been possible without space travel.
[8803.38 → 8804.38] Oh yeah.
[8804.38 → 8805.38] Cool.
[8805.38 → 8811.38] Camera phones, crash resistant lenses, CAT scans, LEDs, landmine removal, athletic shoes, foil blankets,
[8811.38 → 8815.38] water purification system, dust busters, ear thermometers, home insulation, the jaws of
[8815.38 → 8819.38] life, wireless headphones, memory foam, freeze-dried food, adjustable smoke detectors, baby
[8819.38 → 8823.38] formula, artificial limbs, computer mouse, portable computers.
[8823.38 → 8827.38] I don't know if computer mice or portable computers are, are important to you guys at
[8827.38 → 8828.38] all.
[8828.38 → 8830.38] Um, I don't know who got that list.
[8830.38 → 8831.38] It's not conclusive.
[8831.38 → 8834.38] Uh, that was on some random site that somebody in full plane shared.
[8834.38 → 8837.38] Um, don't forget the movie Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks.
[8837.38 → 8838.38] True.
[8838.38 → 8840.38] Never would have gotten that without space travel.
[8840.38 → 8841.38] Good stuff.
[8841.38 → 8842.38] Good stuff.
[8842.38 → 8843.38] Important stuff.
[8843.38 → 8850.38] Um, but yeah, like the, the reason why I'm so into NASA isn't, isn't just cause like
[8850.38 → 8851.38] space stuff.
[8851.38 → 8852.38] Cool.
[8852.38 → 8853.38] Space stuff is cool.
[8853.38 → 8854.38] Super cool.
[8854.38 → 8855.38] Space stuff.
[8855.38 → 8859.38] Cool is objectively based, but that was NASA's website.
[8859.38 → 8862.38] It didn't look like it to me.
[8862.38 → 8864.38] NASA has a fair bit of credibility.
[8864.38 → 8866.38] If it was NASA's website, I don't mind it.
[8866.38 → 8867.38] It was.
[8867.38 → 8868.38] Yeah.
[8868.38 → 8871.38] What does it say at the top of the picture?
[8871.38 → 8872.38] One sec.
[8872.38 → 8873.38] Oh, whatever.
[8873.38 → 8875.38] I read something wrong.
[8875.38 → 8876.38] My bad.
[8876.38 → 8878.38] Uh, that was absolutely NASA's website.
[8878.38 → 8879.38] It's not conclusive though.
[8879.38 → 8886.38] So I don't, I don't know what's going on there, but anyway, um, it's, it's cause in
[8886.38 → 8889.38] a way it represents like human advancement.
[8889.38 → 8892.38] Like it's not just space travel.
[8892.38 → 8893.38] A lot of it is science.
[8893.38 → 8894.38] Well, yeah.
[8894.38 → 8895.38] A lot of it is.
[8895.38 → 8896.38] A lot of it is.
[8896.38 → 8897.38] With the one small step for mankind.
[8897.38 → 8898.38] Yeah.
[8898.38 → 8899.38] That one giant.
[8899.38 → 8900.38] It's not, it's not just rocket.
[8900.38 → 8901.38] Cool.
[8901.38 → 8902.38] Rocket.
[8902.38 → 8903.38] Go fast.
[8903.38 → 8904.38] Space.
[8904.38 → 8905.38] Neat.
[8905.38 → 8906.38] Like grow.
[8906.38 → 8912.38] There's that whole thing of like every scientific discovery is this like tiny microscopic pimple
[8912.38 → 8915.38] on the circle of knowledge that humans have.
[8915.38 → 8919.38] And it's like, yeah, but when you do that a lot, the circle grows bigger.
[8919.38 → 8922.38] This was a big part of circle grow bigger.
[8922.38 → 8924.38] Like it's, I don't know.
[8924.38 → 8927.38] Um, it's rough.
[8927.38 → 8930.38] I don't, I think this is bad for the world.
[8930.38 → 8933.38] Um, it's also inspirational.
[8933.38 → 8934.38] Yeah, absolutely.
[8934.38 → 8935.38] Hugely.
[8935.38 → 8936.38] So, um, apparently not anymore.
[8936.38 → 8939.38] I mean, remember when we were kids, kids wanted to be, what was it?
[8939.38 → 8944.38] Doctors, astronauts, astronauts, and firefighters and heads of state.
[8944.38 → 8947.38] And now it's an influencer TikToker.
[8947.38 → 8948.38] Yeah.
[8948.38 → 8949.38] That would be you.
[8949.38 → 8950.38] Yeah.
[8950.38 → 8951.38] Being me is not that great.
[8951.38 → 8952.38] A little bit less so him.
[8952.38 → 8953.38] Yeah.
[8953.38 → 8955.38] Because they want to be bigger on the short form media.
[8955.38 → 8956.38] Yeah.
[8956.38 → 8957.38] That's fair.
[8957.38 → 8958.38] Yeah.
[8958.38 → 8959.38] And they probably don't want to be older.
[8959.38 → 8960.38] And then they start figuring out the money stuff, and then they want to get on YouTube.
[8960.38 → 8961.38] Yeah.
[8961.38 → 8963.38] It's when they're a little older, they want to get on YouTube.
[8963.38 → 8964.38] Yeah.
[8964.38 → 8965.38] Yeah.
[8965.38 → 8966.38] Yeah.
[8966.38 → 8967.38] Yeah.
[8967.38 → 8968.38] Yeah.
[8968.38 → 8969.38] Yeah.
[8969.38 → 8970.38] Yeah.
[8970.38 → 8971.38] Yeah.
[8971.38 → 8972.38] Yeah.
[8972.38 → 8973.38] Yeah.
[8973.38 → 8974.38] Yeah.
[8974.38 → 8975.38] Yeah.
[8975.38 → 8976.38] Yeah.
[8976.38 → 8977.38] Yeah.
[8977.38 → 8978.38] Yeah.
[8978.38 → 8979.38] Yeah.
[8979.38 → 8980.38] The next question.
[8980.38 → 8981.38] Yeah.
[8981.38 → 8982.38] Yeah.
[8982.38 → 8985.38] Uh, last week user David The Runner posted on our sub, Reddit.
[8985.38 → 8991.38] Their custom 3D holographic display, which has been added to their graduation cap.
[8991.38 → 8996.38] It reads, I survived with solid works, Microsoft suite, open AI and LTT.
[8996.38 → 9004.20] LTT. Hey, congrats on making it to university, but this does spark an interesting conversation about AI use in schools.
[9005.46 → 9011.00] David left a comment on the post talking about using AI to assist with some learning and to help with assisting in written works.
[9012.02 → 9013.62] Do you want to just, can I screen share?
[9013.82 → 9014.00] Yep.
[9015.04 → 9015.60] Super cool.
[9019.36 → 9020.30] That's pretty sick.
[9020.30 → 9020.38] That's awesome.
[9020.62 → 9020.82] Yeah.
[9023.68 → 9025.26] Super cool graduation cap.
[9026.38 → 9027.90] Absolutely chatted.
[9028.24 → 9028.74] Love it.
[9029.48 → 9030.92] What else we got?
[9030.98 → 9032.66] What else we got this week that we're supposed to be talking about?
[9032.72 → 9033.32] Ah, yes.
[9034.46 → 9034.98] Giant.
[9035.38 → 9037.00] Whoa, what's going on?
[9037.50 → 9039.94] Giant layoff bomb hits video games.
[9040.38 → 9053.80] After creative director Dan Sickert left Giant Bomb, its parent company, Fandom, hit the pause button on its subsidiaries' production to perform a strategic reset and realignment of their media brands.
[9053.80 → 9058.80] This comes two years after much of the Giant Bomb core left the gaming outlet.
[9059.58 → 9068.46] Polygon has been hit with over 20 layoffs after being sold to Vox, by Vox to Valet, owner of 27 plus Click Farm publications.
[9068.46 → 9086.32] Valet has been mired in controversy, including a lawsuit directed at competitor The Wrap for $64.5 million in damages due to libel from their article about Valet owner Hassan Youssef's ties to porn and accusation of sweatshop like working conditions.
[9086.32 → 9088.32] All alleged.
[9088.32 → 9089.24] Alleged.
[9091.80 → 9097.52] OG, the wrap article seems pretty legit, and I think the lawsuit is a Hail Mary defence.
[9097.66 → 9099.70] This is from our writer.
[9100.40 → 9101.82] I don't know what OG means.
[9101.96 → 9104.06] Do we have a writer whose initials are OG?
[9105.20 → 9106.38] Not that I can think of.
[9106.42 → 9107.62] Anyway, allegedly, allegedly.
[9107.96 → 9108.74] Original gangster?
[9109.04 → 9109.66] Yeah, but thanks.
[9109.80 → 9110.78] Thanks for that, Dan.
[9111.60 → 9114.40] Original gangster, the wrap article seems pretty legit.
[9114.40 → 9115.62] Yeah, okay.
[9115.78 → 9116.74] Guys, it's fine.
[9117.16 → 9131.58] EA has laid off between 300 and 400 employees this week, with 100 of them coming from Premiere Studio Respawn, which has resulted in two game cancellations, including, sorry Luke, a new Titan fall-based extraction shooter.
[9131.68 → 9132.80] This was so depressing to hear.
[9132.80 → 9142.92] Narrative designer Heather Woodward was one of the people let go just 24 hours after the reveal of the first character that she wrote for Apex.
[9144.40 → 9151.82] And, hold on, where's this link that I, man, where's the link I sent in the chat?
[9152.08 → 9164.08] If I, okay, if I send a link in the chat, it kind of means that I want to talk about the stuff it says in the chat, and, oh man, how to get fired from video games industry.
[9164.42 → 9165.60] This is hilarious.
[9165.60 → 9169.38] Make a successful game.
[9169.78 → 9172.68] Well, no, it's got, it's got a whole, it's got a bunch of examples.
[9173.30 → 9176.96] Who, oh man, Apex layoff.
[9177.36 → 9178.36] Hold on, hold on.
[9178.44 → 9178.92] Where is it?
[9179.90 → 9180.40] Dang it.
[9184.14 → 9185.34] Dang it, I can't find it.
[9186.52 → 9187.84] Is it from PC Gamer?
[9187.84 → 9189.20] Yeah, this is it.
[9189.26 → 9190.44] This is it from PC Gamer.
[9190.52 → 9199.46] They've actually got a pretty, I don't want to call it funny because this is really terrible news, but they've got a humorous, a humorous take on the situation.
[9200.04 → 9204.44] Let's look at all the reasons why you might get laid off while working on a game, shall we?
[9204.80 → 9206.06] Your game doesn't do well.
[9206.46 → 9207.38] Okay, sure.
[9207.84 → 9209.70] Your game is called a success by Microsoft.
[9210.34 → 9211.42] Microsoft lays you off.
[9211.74 → 9214.72] You help make a game as successful as Marvel rivals.
[9215.18 → 9216.12] You are then laid off.
[9216.12 → 9218.54] Your studio gets acquired for over $60 billion.
[9219.04 → 9220.04] You are then laid off.
[9220.28 → 9223.96] You endure executive pressure that forces you into making games your studio isn't good at making.
[9224.12 → 9224.96] It doesn't go well.
[9225.28 → 9226.52] You are then laid off.
[9227.20 → 9228.90] I guess that was Monolith, I assume.
[9229.28 → 9230.06] I'm assuming, yeah.
[9230.32 → 9230.74] I don't know.
[9231.44 → 9232.18] Oh no, this is arcane.
[9233.16 → 9234.04] That doesn't make sense.
[9234.14 → 9234.28] Okay.
[9235.40 → 9241.98] Someone decides your portfolio needs to be aligned, reorganized, restructured, become more flexible, agile, versatile under economic industry conditions.
[9242.26 → 9245.02] Meanwhile, your CEO might have spent $2 million on vintage cars.
[9245.02 → 9246.80] You are then laid off.
[9247.46 → 9251.54] Now we can add, you dared to work on a video game to that list, I guess.
[9253.56 → 9254.02] This is...
[9254.72 → 9256.22] I don't understand the...
[9256.22 → 9258.40] I'm not understanding the logic here.
[9259.68 → 9261.76] Can you help me understand the logic?
[9262.84 → 9264.48] Can any of you help me understand the logic?
[9264.58 → 9266.02] Are any of you video game executives?
[9266.36 → 9267.14] Well, I think...
[9267.14 → 9267.32] Okay.
[9267.68 → 9269.94] This has nothing to do with the video game industry.
[9270.18 → 9270.52] They could be.
[9270.52 → 9272.40] You don't know that they aren't.
[9272.40 → 9280.22] I think there's been a strong correlation since like 2023 of shrink company stock go up.
[9280.90 → 9283.62] Well, I think that's well before 2023, sir.
[9283.84 → 9284.14] Is it?
[9284.24 → 9290.54] Maybe more specific to the game industry, which admittedly probably had gotten a little bit overambitious because of the COVID boom.
[9290.54 → 9295.34] But I mean, shrink company stock go up has been a thing.
[9296.54 → 9306.06] Yeah, but there was a lot of drive, like especially in 2020, but also before 2020, before COVID stuff, for gaming and tech companies to massively inflate their staff numbers.
[9306.06 → 9307.50] For gaming and tech companies, yes.
[9307.50 → 9314.42] But I'd say more generally, you know, especially if a company is, you know, falling slightly short of analysts for projections.
[9315.08 → 9315.74] So shrink it, yeah.
[9315.88 → 9316.50] That's been a thing for a long time.
[9316.50 → 9318.10] Shrink it stock go up has been a thing for a long time.
[9318.34 → 9320.76] I don't think we've seen it in gaming and tech for a long time.
[9320.76 → 9327.80] And then in COVID eras, they cranked to inflate the staff numbers harder than ever before.
[9328.42 → 9334.46] And then coming out of it, they're like, oh, wait, there's this way to pump the stock where you just fire a ton of people.
[9334.46 → 9337.82] Okay, there are a few things, few things in float plane chat.
[9337.94 → 9339.86] This is a very passionate topic for them.
[9340.38 → 9344.48] Jack Welch, former GE CEO, apparently started the fire people to make stock go uptrend.
[9344.70 → 9345.72] That was a long time ago.
[9346.46 → 9349.12] But we already kind of, we're all caught up on that.
[9349.42 → 9351.76] Alana Pierce apparently has a perfect video about these layoffs.
[9351.84 → 9354.38] So you guys are apparently going to want to go check that out.
[9354.50 → 9356.66] Source FSP 9.
[9356.90 → 9360.22] But there was actually another one that I wanted to look at here.
[9360.24 → 9362.08] And this is from Screened in the float plane chat.
[9362.08 → 9367.52] CEOs of these companies need to stop selling their studios to giant corporations.
[9368.52 → 9369.86] But here's the thing.
[9370.18 → 9372.50] It's not quite that simple.
[9373.16 → 9376.80] And when we toured Monolith, it was actually shortly after their acquisition.
[9377.24 → 9382.28] And talking to folks there, the decision kind of made a lot of sense.
[9382.96 → 9386.28] Monolith was, I would say, like more of an AA developer.
[9386.58 → 9388.82] Do you say that's a fair assessment?
[9388.82 → 9391.22] I wouldn't call a game like Fear AAA.
[9391.74 → 9391.96] Yeah.
[9392.08 → 9395.30] Like it was on a relatively, relatively small budget.
[9395.34 → 9396.34] What's the definition again?
[9397.22 → 9398.04] AAA games.
[9398.04 → 9398.80] Big budget essentially.
[9399.00 → 9399.64] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9399.70 → 9399.90] Yeah.
[9400.62 → 9403.00] Do you guys think that's a fair characterization?
[9403.42 → 9404.30] I think so.
[9404.52 → 9404.92] Characterization?
[9405.44 → 9406.26] I would say so for sure.
[9406.26 → 9409.82] So I would say, you know, Monolith is like an AA game maker.
[9409.82 → 9412.92] And even at that time, this was years ago, right?
[9413.24 → 9425.14] Even at that time, they were looking at the trend in the gaming industry of development costs going essentially parabolic.
[9425.14 → 9436.10] And the returns going parabolic as well, but only for a small handful of successful titles.
[9436.10 → 9445.02] So basically, what you were locked in was this endless cycle of like, bet the entire farm.
[9445.62 → 9446.84] Work, work, work, work, work.
[9447.02 → 9448.52] Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind.
[9448.74 → 9450.02] Crunch, crunch, crunch.
[9450.18 → 9452.26] Until you finally get to release.
[9453.24 → 9456.26] Hope that you have absolutely nailed it.
[9456.62 → 9456.90] Right?
[9457.10 → 9457.96] Because you bet everything.
[9458.38 → 9460.02] So you're swinging for the fences.
[9460.38 → 9461.48] You hope you nailed it.
[9461.48 → 9465.60] You get this enormous windfall of cash that's even bigger than last time.
[9466.02 → 9467.00] Everybody has a party.
[9467.42 → 9469.16] Realistically, a lot of people still lose their jobs.
[9469.34 → 9476.16] Like QA staff are not really needed toward the beginning of game development, where it's more about ideation and laying, you know, groundwork or whatever else.
[9476.54 → 9477.96] And then you rinse and repeat.
[9478.74 → 9482.34] Because the expectation from the customer is bigger and bigger and bigger.
[9482.54 → 9486.14] I mean, why do you think it's taking Rockstar so bloody long to make Grand Theft Auto 6?
[9486.30 → 9487.16] Which just got delayed.
[9488.60 → 9491.06] Thesaurus in Full Plane Chat said, then you made Starfield.
[9491.48 → 9493.04] Oof.
[9493.56 → 9494.70] Well, that's exactly it.
[9494.78 → 9498.94] And so, to answer your question, why do they sell out?
[9499.24 → 9501.12] They sell out because that's exhausting.
[9502.06 → 9505.16] And it's terrifying to go all in.
[9505.22 → 9510.52] I can tell you guys, as a business owner who has gone all in multiple times.
[9510.52 → 9514.74] Imagine you just make one product every like five years.
[9517.20 → 9519.94] If that product's not a banger, like ouch.
[9519.94 → 9525.42] And even if it is a banger, how many underappreciated, how many copies of Freelancer sold?
[9525.74 → 9526.52] I want to know.
[9526.66 → 9528.90] I want to know how many copies of Freelancer sold.
[9528.90 → 9532.80] Okay.
[9533.80 → 9543.42] The video game Freelancer is reported to have sold approximately 20,000 copies in the UK during the first half of 2003.
[9543.42 → 9549.54] While exact total sales figures are not readily available, there were hopes that the game would sell at least 500,000 copies.
[9549.54 → 9555.20] And I can tell you that if it did 20,000 in the UK, it sure as hell didn't do 500,000 copies worldwide.
[9555.20 → 9559.62] It was an awesome game.
[9560.56 → 9560.96] Awesome.
[9561.64 → 9562.52] So good.
[9564.18 → 9565.40] That doesn't mean it's successful.
[9565.48 → 9566.92] Yeah, people bringing up Titan fall.
[9567.28 → 9570.98] Just because a game is great doesn't mean that it's going to sell.
[9571.16 → 9572.54] So you could do everything right.
[9573.22 → 9575.34] And you could still get fucked.
[9575.34 → 9581.82] And like, Titan fall was largely, a lot of people's opinion on that was that they were the release window.
[9582.22 → 9582.32] Prey.
[9582.46 → 9582.98] Yeah, Prey.
[9582.98 → 9583.82] Marketing and stuff.
[9584.52 → 9586.12] Prey was a super cool game.
[9586.42 → 9587.62] Total commercial flop.
[9588.44 → 9593.34] I mean, as far as I could tell, they probably gave away more copies with GPUs than they actually sold.
[9593.34 → 9600.80] So that's the thing, right?
[9600.92 → 9602.58] So why do they sell out, Luke?
[9603.04 → 9604.90] Well, because they're terrified.
[9605.72 → 9615.00] Because that's their opportunity to realistically to cash in on all the work that they did leading up until that moment.
[9615.10 → 9617.14] Like, yeah, they got paid their salary or whatever else.
[9617.14 → 9630.96] But if they're sitting there at that moment, they just launched a huge game, and they get a big offer that values their company at something akin to the revenue that they're making right now on this huge game launch, put yourself in their shoes.
[9630.96 → 9631.74] Most people would sell.
[9631.74 → 9647.10] And tell me that you have the personal integrity, or you have the personal code that would make you turn away tens of millions of dollars versus fear for your livelihood daily.
[9648.44 → 9653.54] I can tell you a lot of people are not going to answer this truthfully.
[9653.60 → 9653.90] I know.
[9654.68 → 9656.36] They might think they are.
[9656.60 → 9658.22] And I still bet you it's not true.
[9658.22 → 9664.30] It is, I can tell you from experience, it is really difficult to say no to tens of millions of dollars.
[9666.18 → 9667.10] Super hard.
[9669.08 → 9670.04] Doesn't regret it.
[9670.66 → 9671.48] Super hard.
[9671.58 → 9672.12] Kind of based.
[9673.52 → 9674.60] Super hard though.
[9675.36 → 9676.70] Not easy decision.
[9680.12 → 9681.24] And you know what?
[9681.24 → 9684.10] I got to tell you, I got to tell you that I had...
[9684.10 → 9684.52] I think it's a weird flex.
[9684.86 → 9686.64] No, I had a big advantage there.
[9687.22 → 9688.06] Huge advantage.
[9688.66 → 9691.42] Because when my offer came...
[9691.42 → 9692.32] We weren't starving.
[9693.02 → 9694.10] I already...
[9694.10 → 9697.86] I had literally just purchased my dream home.
[9698.18 → 9698.44] Yeah.
[9698.88 → 9699.10] Right?
[9699.22 → 9703.44] Like, we were in a sustainable space, right?
[9703.48 → 9705.14] Like, we never took startup capital.
[9705.62 → 9713.56] We weren't like spending someone else's money and trying to figure out returns and then taking the windfall and having to reinvest it.
[9713.56 → 9717.30] Maybe even going to debt towards the end of it to get this thing over the line.
[9717.30 → 9718.00] And take on investment.
[9718.00 → 9720.12] We weren't playing any of those games.
[9720.30 → 9724.78] I was running a profitable month to month, year to year, even day to day.
[9724.84 → 9726.44] I was running a profitable company.
[9726.44 → 9734.84] And, you know, realistically, another $10 million wouldn't have changed my daily life.
[9735.84 → 9738.26] It just wouldn't have really made a difference.
[9738.26 → 9742.78] And, yeah, that is an extremely privileged position.
[9742.78 → 9749.38] And I recognize that that is realistically a huge part of why I was able to make the decision I was able to make.
[9749.38 → 9756.52] But when making payroll every week is, like, absolutely freaking terrifying, I can understand.
[9757.84 → 9758.90] I can understand.
[9759.20 → 9760.48] I would not do it.
[9761.56 → 9763.56] I can understand someone doing it.
[9763.60 → 9770.08] And I really don't believe that a lot of people that would be like, I wouldn't do it.
[9770.16 → 9771.86] I don't believe that most of them wouldn't do it.
[9772.54 → 9772.86] Me neither.
[9772.86 → 9775.40] I've been in related scenarios.
[9775.70 → 9777.98] So I can kind of trust my own answer, I think.
[9779.44 → 9782.34] But, yeah, I don't know.
[9782.68 → 9782.88] Yeah.
[9783.26 → 9787.34] So our workman in Float plane Chat put it really well.
[9787.82 → 9792.58] I came to my decision from a position of power, not a position of fear.
[9792.58 → 9797.96] If I had been in a position of fear, it would have been totally different.
[9798.06 → 9803.12] I had a little bit of fear, which was a big part of why I even started the conversation in the first place.
[9803.14 → 9806.84] To be clear, when I say started, I mean was receptive to the conversation.
[9806.94 → 9807.54] I didn't reach out.
[9808.72 → 9810.10] And that fear was that...
[9810.10 → 9811.36] There's also just an interesting conversation.
[9811.48 → 9814.32] Sometimes you want to have those conversations even with zero intent.
[9814.44 → 9815.80] I like knowing what my stuff's worth.
[9815.92 → 9816.26] Yes.
[9816.32 → 9818.34] It's like getting your coin collection a SAID.
[9818.58 → 9819.48] I want to know what my company's worth.
[9819.48 → 9820.84] It's an interesting conversation.
[9820.84 → 9821.04] Yeah.
[9821.54 → 9825.08] So we hadn't launched Backpack yet.
[9825.98 → 9830.64] So I had some fear that we had made an enormous bet that wasn't going to pay off.
[9830.80 → 9836.48] But as I talked about prior to the Backpack launch, which was a big part of the whole trust me bro controversy,
[9837.08 → 9841.20] we even were approaching that large bet from a position of strength.
[9841.32 → 9844.74] If I had to refund every single one of those backpacks, I could afford it.
[9845.02 → 9845.74] I knew that.
[9846.28 → 9846.52] Right?
[9846.52 → 9846.56] Right.
[9846.88 → 9855.04] I wasn't in the position of like a game company, of someone in a leadership position at a game company,
[9855.04 → 9859.34] where they literally wouldn't know where their next meal was coming from if their next game flopped.
[9859.42 → 9860.66] And this isn't always true.
[9861.12 → 9861.40] No.
[9861.40 → 9867.80] There are companies that are much more financially stable that still sell out.
[9868.42 → 9870.24] There's all these different scenarios, right?
[9870.46 → 9879.60] But I think the one that Linus is describing is a pretty common one for probably the majority of studios that aren't just making like incredible bank all the time.
[9879.60 → 9880.94] Not everybody's Marian.
[9881.00 → 9891.52] If they have an as-a-service game or whatever else, or they're just like printing money with like, you know, a dozen active mobile games that are, you know, gotcha AF.
[9892.00 → 9893.08] Like, sure.
[9893.34 → 9894.92] There's definitely examples.
[9894.94 → 9898.02] They already did the selling out basically at that point.
[9898.08 → 9899.96] They just sold out to themselves, I guess.
[9899.98 → 9903.10] So I guess I'm talking more about your traditional game studio.
[9903.10 → 9907.18] Your traditional medium level successful, medium to low level successful.
[9907.18 → 9923.26] I'm speaking from my experience doing the tour at Monolith, basically speaking to people who literally just went through this acquisition and more recently have now been shuttered because they were pushed to make a game that wasn't really aligned with their experience.
[9923.90 → 9926.74] Or no, no, that one was the Wonder Woman IP one.
[9926.90 → 9928.80] Sorry, that was actually a slightly different situation.
[9931.94 → 9932.30] Ah...
[9933.10 → 9936.16] I mean, pay, pay 90 brings up a good point.
[9936.24 → 9939.40] I mean, technically even Marian's kind of got some 10 cent on their shit.
[9939.40 → 9939.84] That's a misleading...
[9939.84 → 9940.02] Yeah.
[9940.34 → 9942.50] The way it was originally typed is a misleading statement.
[9942.54 → 9945.80] But they, they, they had to go, they had to go sniffing around for money.
[9945.84 → 9955.88] And if anything, I think that kind of adds strength to the point that I'm trying to make where it is a it is a ruthless, ruthless, cutthroat business.
[9956.78 → 9957.48] It's tough.
[9957.66 → 9958.64] One of the most problems.
[9958.64 → 9969.88] And if, if someone, if someone succeeds in that business and gets an opportunity to get theirs, and they take it, we cannot agree.
[9970.44 → 9971.86] We cannot like it.
[9971.94 → 9972.70] I can understand.
[9972.70 → 9976.70] But I think that there are very few people, and you might be one of them.
[9976.76 → 9978.20] I believe you are probably one of them.
[9978.20 → 9986.78] You might be one of them who would say no, who would walk away from it and who would swing for the fences again and again and again and would never get tired of it.
[9986.78 → 9992.96] But I do believe that most people would just say, well, I mean, I got to eat.
[9993.02 → 9995.04] My kid's got to go to school, you know?
[9995.32 → 9996.48] Especially when you have dependents.
[9996.80 → 9997.10] Yeah.
[9997.50 → 9999.02] My wife's got to drive a nice car.
[9999.28 → 10003.04] My family, my family member has whatever problem.
[10003.04 → 10003.50] Some illness.
[10003.56 → 10004.78] That I could solve with this.
[10004.78 → 10006.04] Just imagine.
[10006.40 → 10006.70] Yeah.
[10006.70 → 10014.56] I mean, look at, look at what people, look at what people will do for, you know, the payouts on something like Beast Games.
[10014.80 → 10015.24] Yeah.
[10015.30 → 10015.52] Right?
[10016.02 → 10018.26] Or, I mean, just Mr. Beast's videos in general.
[10018.42 → 10019.52] Look no further than that.
[10019.52 → 10019.80] You hear the reasons, right?
[10019.80 → 10027.16] Like, I'm in a fairly privileged position that no one in my life is in one of those scenarios, right?
[10027.16 → 10039.40] So, like, if my mom was, like, not going to make it unless I had a ton of money to ship her off to some country to pay for some really expensive operation and somebody was like, you could do this thing.
[10040.16 → 10041.00] Yeah, you'd do it.
[10041.16 → 10041.34] Yeah.
[10041.50 → 10042.02] No question.
[10042.10 → 10043.32] So, like, there are lines.
[10043.50 → 10044.28] Everyone has lines.
[10044.52 → 10049.80] In my current scenario, I can resist because I'm fine and I'll be fine.
[10049.86 → 10051.40] And I enjoy swinging for the fences.
[10051.58 → 10052.70] And I like it when it's hard.
[10052.70 → 10054.70] So, pause.
[10054.70 → 10055.30] Pause.
[10055.98 → 10060.66] But, you know, things could change that would sway me for sure.
[10063.44 → 10064.18] All right.
[10064.20 → 10065.22] What are we supposed to be talking about?
[10065.64 → 10066.24] Who knows?
[10066.64 → 10066.98] Oh, yeah.
[10067.00 → 10068.28] The giant layoff bomb.
[10068.70 → 10068.88] Yeah.
[10069.40 → 10071.80] DOJ antitrust plan could kill Google search.
[10072.58 → 10083.92] Testifying during the remedies phase of Google's search antitrust trial on Wednesday, Google CEO Sander Pi chai claimed the U.S. government's plan to rectify Google's search monopoly might make it hard to justify
[10083.92 → 10086.12] continuing to build a search engine at all.
[10086.90 → 10093.74] The government has proposed that Google be required to share much of its search data and search index with competitors for a marginal cost.
[10094.40 → 10101.40] Pi chai said that this would be a disaster that would allow anyone to completely reverse engineer end-to-end any part of our technology stack.
[10101.40 → 10105.76] Pi chai's testimony also touched on the government's proposal to force Google to sell Chrome.
[10106.32 → 10111.60] Several companies have expressed an interest, but Pi chai argued there's no other company that could match Google's care for the browser.
[10111.60 → 10121.80] Google spent tens of billions of dollars on Chrome in the past decade and is responsible for more than 90% of the code commits to the open source Chromium project, which makes up the core of Chrome and several other browsers.
[10122.28 → 10132.08] This comes as Google's share of global online search traffic has dipped below 90% for the first time in a decade and has dropped below 80% in the desktop PC segment.
[10132.08 → 10142.74] I mean, isn't Google basically like not going to bother making their traditional search engine any more anyway?
[10142.86 → 10144.10] Isn't that kind of the direction that we're going?
[10144.40 → 10145.08] It feels like it.
[10145.60 → 10148.32] I think we're just, we're just going AI at this point.
[10148.84 → 10155.04] In other Google News, Google has killed smart features for their first and second gen Nest thermostats.
[10155.28 → 10157.76] They will be killed effective October 25th, 2025.
[10159.44 → 10159.92] Okay.
[10160.34 → 10161.36] So hear me out.
[10162.08 → 10163.26] Actually not hear me out.
[10163.38 → 10164.60] I want to hear your take on this.
[10165.14 → 10169.06] The first gen Nest learning thermostat came out 14 years ago.
[10171.52 → 10173.62] You can still use it as a normal thermostat.
[10173.76 → 10174.34] What are the features?
[10175.34 → 10178.52] Well, the like learning and I guess the app control, right?
[10181.48 → 10185.22] I think there's a difference between killing and no longer supporting.
[10186.14 → 10188.88] Is it being killed or are they no longer supporting it?
[10188.88 → 10191.26] It is effectively being killed.
[10191.26 → 10195.08] You can, yeah, you can't use the mobile app for control anymore.
[10195.58 → 10195.98] Scheduling.
[10196.08 → 10201.84] This is why, like, this is a huge part of the reason why I put a strong preference on if I'm buying something.
[10202.58 → 10204.52] I mean, this happened with, what was it?
[10204.56 → 10207.60] The like floor cleaning robot for Smash James or something?
[10207.60 → 10207.90] Mm-hmm.
[10207.90 → 10209.30] You were like, what happens?
[10209.56 → 10212.04] Like, can I, can I main, I don't remember the exact.
[10212.04 → 10213.94] Can I still use it if you guys.
[10213.94 → 10215.00] If the internet goes out or whatever.
[10215.00 → 10215.18] Yeah.
[10215.18 → 10216.78] And you're, they were like, what?
[10216.94 → 10219.08] And your reason was because you guys might not exist.
[10219.08 → 10220.44] And they're like, of course we'll exist.
[10220.58 → 10221.80] This is my whole point.
[10221.80 → 10236.68] If, if the smart learning stuff I paid more for upfront sticker price because the hardware in order to do that is in the device, and it happens locally, I am personally much more willing to buy.
[10237.22 → 10238.84] I don't think that's universally true.
[10238.92 → 10241.02] People look at the sticker price, do it entirely based off that.
[10241.02 → 10242.84] So they want the cheaper device where it happens remotely.
[10243.44 → 10246.52] Um, but this is why, right?
[10248.52 → 10249.74] I think I'm still mad.
[10249.74 → 10254.66] I don't think I care that it's 14 years ago because I didn't necessarily buy it on launch day.
[10254.74 → 10258.22] So that, that timeline is honestly probably shorter.
[10258.86 → 10270.38] And like, I'm not saying I'm not mad because this thing is sold with these features, and it doesn't, it never said, Hey, we'll turn them off in 14 years.
[10270.38 → 10270.78] Yeah.
[10270.92 → 10275.76] And if you bought it seven years ago, it, it didn't say, Hey, we're going to turn it off in seven years.
[10275.86 → 10277.88] No, when I saw 14 years, it still works.
[10278.06 → 10278.46] WTF.
[10278.58 → 10280.06] They're killing specific features.
[10280.18 → 10282.12] They're not saying that it's not working at all.
[10282.64 → 10283.00] Yeah.
[10283.00 → 10285.48] Like when I saw 14 years, I was like, I don't know.
[10285.54 → 10287.32] Do you really expect something to last 14 years?
[10287.32 → 10289.20] And I was like, yeah, I do a thermostat.
[10289.42 → 10289.74] Yes.
[10290.38 → 10292.84] I expect a thermostat to last as long as my house.
[10292.94 → 10293.44] Pretty much.
[10293.48 → 10293.68] Yeah.
[10293.94 → 10295.56] Like what are, what are we even talking about here?
[10296.18 → 10300.20] Like this is not a, you know, this is not a smoke detector, you know, change it every five years
[10300.20 → 10300.98] or 10 years or whatever.
[10301.08 → 10302.16] This is a fricking thermostat.
[10302.40 → 10302.68] Does it?
[10302.70 → 10303.52] I don't have one.
[10303.76 → 10306.72] Is there the app control was the selling point?
[10306.76 → 10306.86] Yeah.
[10306.86 → 10307.18] He knows.
[10307.24 → 10307.90] That's what he's saying.
[10308.06 → 10308.36] Guys, chill.
[10308.36 → 10309.40] What are you talking about, man?
[10309.42 → 10309.84] That's what he said.
[10309.86 → 10310.50] No, it's the same guy.
[10310.52 → 10311.50] He said it still works.
[10311.86 → 10312.22] WTF.
[10312.44 → 10314.08] And he said the app control was the selling point.
[10315.08 → 10315.24] What?
[10315.72 → 10316.76] What are you talking about?
[10316.98 → 10317.98] What are you talking about?
[10319.02 → 10322.70] Because my point with like, if there are things on it that happen locally,
[10322.70 → 10324.50] it becomes a dumb thermostat now.
[10324.50 → 10326.06] So there's no learning anymore.
[10326.20 → 10330.42] And the easy thing to do if this, if, if a lot more of the stuff happened locally,
[10330.42 → 10332.26] which maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
[10332.32 → 10332.62] I don't know.
[10332.66 → 10335.68] I don't know this product very well, but the easy thing to do would just make it so that
[10335.68 → 10337.70] people could control it with like home assistant or something.
[10338.00 → 10338.36] Yeah.
[10338.42 → 10339.56] But that's not that easy.
[10339.56 → 10343.50] You can't ask people to set up a flipping home assistant, but it would be much cooler
[10343.50 → 10345.44] on the company if they allowed people to.
[10345.78 → 10347.66] I don't know that it doesn't, to be clear.
[10348.28 → 10349.98] Uh, pro, he says you can use home.
[10350.06 → 10351.94] You can, but you can't expect a Norrie.
[10351.94 → 10353.06] No, but that is better.
[10353.28 → 10354.94] This is the problem with the cloud.
[10355.06 → 10356.50] This is the problem with anything that's in the cloud.
[10356.50 → 10358.00] They are disabling home assistant access?
[10358.24 → 10358.42] What?
[10358.42 → 10358.92] Are they actually?
[10360.86 → 10361.18] Okay.
[10361.22 → 10362.28] This is worse than I thought.
[10362.34 → 10363.16] I don't know if that's true or not.
[10364.22 → 10368.52] The whole thing should just be immediately open source if they're, if they're killing
[10368.52 → 10368.72] it.
[10368.72 → 10373.54] If it's a smart device, if it has a processor on it, then, I mean, that's the right thing
[10373.54 → 10373.90] to do.
[10374.00 → 10376.92] They should just say, okay, well, here you go then.
[10377.12 → 10379.92] I guess it works locally, but won't work with hardware assistant.
[10379.92 → 10382.00] So it's just losing app control.
[10383.16 → 10386.52] Even the app control thing is weird though, because like, like we said earlier, right?
[10386.54 → 10388.54] You buy a product on a list of features.
[10388.68 → 10393.22] Like I think something needs to change legally, and I don't know what it is.
[10393.80 → 10399.72] Um, but you, you shouldn't be able to sell a product and then as a company take features
[10399.72 → 10400.86] away from that product, right?
[10400.86 → 10402.08] Like that doesn't seem right.
[10402.20 → 10403.18] Man, this is tough.
[10403.28 → 10406.46] So is there, is there, is there like a legal period of time?
[10406.46 → 10413.58] Insomniac points out that the hardware can't do modern cryptographic ciphers, which could
[10413.58 → 10415.72] legitimately be a good reason to EOL it.
[10416.66 → 10418.28] They are offering a discount.
[10418.44 → 10419.30] That's an interesting one.
[10419.40 → 10423.10] On a new thermostat for a fourth gen nest learning thermostat.
[10423.28 → 10428.10] They will give you, uh, looks like $130 off, bring it down to 150 bucks.
[10428.16 → 10431.26] But boy, is that ever a lot of money to rebuy a thing that I thought I was buying.
[10431.26 → 10436.58] Yeah, I don't know.
[10436.68 → 10437.76] I don't think it's okay.
[10438.00 → 10440.12] Aggie says it's not fair to ask them to give that IP up.
[10440.46 → 10441.94] We're not asking them to give it up.
[10442.22 → 10445.56] We're asking them to support it and then failing that.
[10446.10 → 10447.52] Well, I guess they better give it up.
[10447.52 → 10447.66] Give it up.
[10448.64 → 10450.10] They're making a choice though.
[10450.12 → 10457.92] Also, if it's, if it's 14 years old software for a thermostat, it's probably fine to give
[10457.92 → 10458.38] that up.
[10458.38 → 10461.62] Oh, Cats goes fairly sure home assistant went through the cloud.
[10461.70 → 10461.80] Yeah.
[10461.86 → 10467.50] So some home assistant integrations are through the cloud, which is why I insisted on finding
[10467.50 → 10468.80] thermostats that didn't.
[10468.88 → 10470.84] So my eco bees do not.
[10471.04 → 10471.26] Yeah.
[10471.42 → 10471.80] Makes sense.
[10471.86 → 10476.36] They are controllable locally by home assistant, which means that if my internet's down, I can
[10476.36 → 10477.90] still adjust my in-floor heat.
[10478.16 → 10483.12] That's, that's exactly how I would want to do that purchasing decision for sure.
[10484.14 → 10484.86] But yeah, I don't know.
[10484.90 → 10488.30] I think they need to figure something out because this is happening with lots of different products.
[10488.30 → 10490.60] Where they're just being like, no, we're not going to support it anymore.
[10490.70 → 10494.60] And 14 years is a long time, but it's still them going, well, we're not going to support
[10494.60 → 10500.60] this anymore for a device that traditionally people expect these things to last forever.
[10500.60 → 10500.90] Right.
[10501.58 → 10502.02] Yeah.
[10502.02 → 10510.38] I expect a thermostat to just be, if I bolt it to my house functionally, I expect it to
[10510.38 → 10511.30] be part of my house.
[10511.48 → 10511.68] Yeah.
[10511.82 → 10516.68] Like, and I guess the line would be if it's something that is expected to be included when
[10516.68 → 10517.52] I sell the house.
[10518.18 → 10518.40] Yeah.
[10518.50 → 10519.02] You get what I mean?
[10519.10 → 10519.32] Yeah.
[10519.32 → 10523.12] So, you know, most people aren't going to rip their nest off the wall or their dishwasher
[10523.12 → 10523.48] out.
[10523.62 → 10525.84] You know, that, that to me is, is the line, right?
[10525.84 → 10525.96] Yeah.
[10526.32 → 10531.12] So if it, if it's, if it becomes part of my house, I expect it to, you know, last like
[10531.12 → 10531.50] my house.
[10531.54 → 10535.18] I mean, it's not like the thermostats that we had in my house when I was a kid, just like,
[10535.56 → 10538.64] you know, oh yeah, the mercury in the little tube went bad.
[10538.64 → 10539.24] So we throw to it.
[10539.28 → 10540.44] What are you even talking about?
[10540.50 → 10541.34] No, it's a thermostat.
[10541.46 → 10542.26] It's part of the house.
[10542.26 → 10544.16] You just, you need to be able to control the heat and the cold.
[10547.78 → 10550.66] I mean, I think to assume.
[10550.98 → 10551.18] Yeah.
[10551.20 → 10552.24] Like it's like light switches.
[10552.34 → 10552.42] What?
[10552.44 → 10553.82] I'm going to change all my light switches.
[10554.64 → 10556.92] Cause there's like a cryptographic compatibility.
[10557.26 → 10557.96] Practically all mine.
[10558.02 → 10558.70] Because they're breaking.
[10558.82 → 10560.94] Cause our apartment builder sucks.
[10560.94 → 10568.32] But anyway, um, um, Radio 428 says, do you expect a smartwatch to last as long as
[10568.32 → 10572.12] a regular watch is a shorter lifespan, a trade-off for the features?
[10573.26 → 10575.02] Um, for a watch.
[10575.02 → 10578.78] There's a difference between the device dying and the device being killed by a company.
[10579.88 → 10585.40] Cause like I could still use a Pebble smartwatch if I was willing to use a black and white display,
[10585.54 → 10589.52] you know, and I'm willing to, you know, fight with a rebel app or whatever.
[10590.44 → 10591.80] Also that went open sources.
[10591.80 → 10595.48] That's a great example of Google actually open sourcing something that they took over
[10595.48 → 10595.86] and killed.
[10596.06 → 10598.08] So that, that is how it's supposed to work.
[10598.12 → 10598.46] Funny.
[10598.54 → 10601.32] We should be talking about smartwatches, but, um,
[10601.32 → 10603.34] Yeah.
[10603.44 → 10608.86] And like, honestly, I think, I think when people are looking at a traditional watch, uh, versus
[10608.86 → 10614.90] a smartwatch, I think they are, it is very easy to do the calculus of figuring out, Hey,
[10614.94 → 10620.44] this thing might not last as long as this mechanical device that in a lot of cases can last practically
[10620.44 → 10621.44] forever.
[10621.44 → 10625.14] It's not necessarily easy to be like, I'm going to make a random guess on how long this
[10625.14 → 10626.90] company is going to support this thing.
[10626.90 → 10633.40] I also think there's a sort of, a sort of, a sort of implied support period too, right?
[10633.48 → 10639.82] Like when I, when I buy a smartphone accessory, I think the implication is that it's a it's
[10639.82 → 10641.42] kind of piece of my smartphone.
[10641.42 → 10647.36] I don't necessarily compare it to a regular watch and the pitch, the original pitch that
[10647.36 → 10649.50] the company's making is also hugely important.
[10649.50 → 10653.64] Like when Google sold the Nest, or I guess when Nest sold the Nest, because I don't think
[10653.64 → 10656.40] they'd been acquired by Google yet at that point, though you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong
[10656.40 → 10656.92] on the timeline.
[10656.92 → 10660.84] When they sold the Nest, they were just selling a thermostat.
[10661.22 → 10662.14] They were like, it's a thermostat.
[10662.26 → 10664.68] By the way, it also connects to your phone, and it's smart and it learns.
[10665.40 → 10669.84] They, they didn't say like, like to your point earlier that, that it'll stop working in 14
[10669.84 → 10670.16] years.
[10670.52 → 10673.24] But they did say that it connects to your phone, and it's smart and it learns.
[10673.48 → 10674.84] So it's not a phone accessory.
[10675.06 → 10675.30] Totally.
[10675.50 → 10676.52] It's a home accessory.
[10676.80 → 10682.42] If any of those things stop, it's now, it was now, in my opinion, falsely advertised.
[10682.72 → 10686.80] Yeah, because it does still work as a thermostat, but that was never really how they pitched
[10686.80 → 10686.92] it.
[10686.96 → 10690.62] They pitched it as a piece of my home that does all this cool stuff in the cloud.
[10691.00 → 10694.86] Whereas no, to me, the smartwatch is an accessory for your phone.
[10695.06 → 10699.46] Like I, I, and maybe part of that is just like my own mental gymnastics here.
[10699.46 → 10699.92] Like, right.
[10699.98 → 10704.14] Trying to divide a line that was something I intuitively understood or, you know, something
[10704.14 → 10707.18] that I believe, but not necessarily everyone would agree with.
[10707.24 → 10707.40] Right.
[10711.10 → 10711.50] Man.
[10713.56 → 10715.06] This is wild, dude.
[10715.06 → 10720.08] Like there, this is just the tip of this spear.
[10721.80 → 10722.20] Yeah.
[10722.38 → 10722.72] Every.
[10722.96 → 10724.24] This is becoming more and more of a problem.
[10724.36 → 10729.18] Every smart device anyone's ever bought is going to be deprecated at some point and probably
[10729.18 → 10731.96] not properly in our opinion.
[10732.22 → 10732.44] Yeah.
[10734.46 → 10735.14] And then what?
[10735.22 → 10736.08] It's just easy waste.
[10736.76 → 10737.34] That's it.
[10737.66 → 10737.96] Okay.
[10738.06 → 10738.82] After dark time.
[10739.56 → 10740.26] Hit me, Dan.
[10740.26 → 10746.42] Look at that one button.
[10747.22 → 10748.58] Like an absolute house.
[10755.12 → 10756.26] Seems like a low priority.
[10756.48 → 10756.58] Do you?
[10756.74 → 10756.96] Yeah.
[10757.08 → 10758.30] Make an air table integration.
[10758.44 → 10758.66] Yeah.
[10758.78 → 10758.90] Yeah.
[10758.90 → 10762.44] Oh, no.
[10762.88 → 10763.16] Don't.
[10763.24 → 10765.46] You can't say that because he might hear you and then.
[10765.92 → 10766.10] Yeah.
[10766.12 → 10766.36] Don't.
[10766.42 → 10766.58] Don't.
[10766.68 → 10767.66] Don't give Conrad ideas.
[10767.76 → 10768.94] He just does stuff sometimes.
[10770.40 → 10770.84] No.
[10771.36 → 10771.74] Stop it.
[10771.74 → 10781.44] Fake emails.
[10781.44 → 10781.48] I'm muted.
[10782.10 → 10782.76] I'm muted, of course.
[10782.76 → 10783.26] Fake emails.
[10783.50 → 10783.80] Fake personas.
[10783.80 → 10783.88] Fake emails.
[10783.88 → 10784.14] Fake personas.
[10784.44 → 10785.74] Fake emails.
[10785.74 → 10786.16] Fake emails.
[10786.16 → 10786.52] Fake emails.
[10786.52 → 10787.30] Fake emails.
[10787.30 → 10791.50] Fake emails.
[10791.50 → 10792.20] Fake personas.
[10792.34 → 10795.16] I have multiple people.
[10795.36 → 10795.96] Here we go.
[10795.96 → 10802.38] I know their full names, first, middle, last.
[10803.12 → 10805.34] I know lots of these random types of details.
[10805.66 → 10807.62] They have profiles online.
[10808.40 → 10811.62] They have emails, all this kind of stuff that I can just whip out at any time.
[10811.74 → 10812.26] They're not real.
[10813.06 → 10817.14] Made them up mostly when I was like between 13 and 18.
[10817.14 → 10820.98] Tell me you were involved in some shit without telling me you were involved in some shit.
[10821.82 → 10823.60] And I mean, I still got them.
[10823.60 → 10824.74] Oh, man.
[10824.74 → 10827.14] They can be pulled out any time.
[10828.70 → 10832.18] For a long time, I would use the White House as my address for like everything.
[10832.40 → 10832.60] Nice.
[10832.72 → 10837.86] Netflix, my address was the White House the whole time.
[10838.02 → 10844.78] I have to imagine some random junk mail was addressed to me and sent to the White House and thrown out at some point.
[10844.96 → 10845.34] Nice.
[10845.50 → 10846.08] It's pretty cool.
[10846.56 → 10847.76] That's actually pretty based.
[10849.76 → 10851.78] I'm relatively certain that happened.
[10853.70 → 10854.60] Very little.
[10854.74 → 10860.98] I basically use a VPN exclusively for Linux ISOs.
[10862.90 → 10867.74] Because I never know when I'm going to want to like fire up a game and I don't want to have to like to remember to turn off my VPN.
[10867.74 → 10873.28] And I could configure it to only, you know, use certain applications through the VPN.
[10873.28 → 10874.28] That's a good one.
[10874.28 → 10875.96] But I have not been arsed to do that.
[10876.38 → 10877.88] So that's where we're at on that.
[10877.88 → 10885.82] I mean, this is a terrible take, but I have nothing to hide.
[10886.42 → 10889.16] Well, that is a terrible take.
[10889.28 → 10890.78] And that's not even what you believe.
[10890.78 → 10897.98] But I have nothing to hide in a non-oppressive regime and in a societal position of strength.
[10898.06 → 10899.02] That's still a bad take.
[10899.42 → 10900.14] It's a terrible take.
[10900.14 → 10901.44] I just told you it's a terrible take.
[10901.64 → 10906.06] I think your thing is more that everything's already been breached.
[10906.06 → 10908.34] My privacy ship sailed.
[10908.46 → 10908.72] Yeah.
[10908.84 → 10917.52] So long ago that even if I did have stuff to hide, I would have basically no hope of, you know, concealing it from the next hour-long expose.
[10917.82 → 10921.52] It's like locking the windows when all your doors are off the hinges.
[10921.94 → 10924.10] It's like, well, all right.
[10924.10 → 10928.62] And I'm not saying that anything that I'm doing applies to any of you guys.
[10928.64 → 10931.12] And there are still some privacy steps that you take.
[10931.86 → 10932.56] Like what?
[10932.74 → 10933.34] There are some.
[10933.60 → 10933.92] Oh, yeah.
[10933.98 → 10934.52] I take some.
[10935.16 → 10940.08] But you're just not that into it because you're pretty compromised already.
[10940.08 → 10951.82] And realistically, right, like I really found that the amount of interest in my private life and my private life's details declined sharply when I just started publishing it.
[10951.82 → 10960.70] Like when it was hugely, hugely life changing for me when we published the address of Linus Media Group on Google Maps.
[10961.62 → 10964.06] Because all of a sudden, all of the.
[10965.22 → 10966.26] Where's the office?
[10966.38 → 10967.28] Where are they based?
[10967.38 → 10968.32] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[10968.34 → 10968.86] Just went away.
[10969.32 → 10970.40] Just completely went away.
[10972.18 → 10977.48] And, you know, there's obviously still steps that we take with respect to physical privacy and security.
[10977.48 → 10981.84] But, you know, I'm not deluded.
[10982.10 → 10982.56] Right.
[10982.60 → 10985.60] Like I'm obviously aware that I drive a pretty distinctive car.
[10986.80 → 10992.38] That is a decision that I have made knowing what the security and privacy implications are.
[10992.74 → 10998.46] I don't think that I'm a particularly polarizing figure for the most part.
[10998.46 → 11003.56] But, you know, it does only take one completely deranged person, I guess, at the end of the day.
[11003.64 → 11010.82] But like I don't actually see anybody being like that mad about like a bad review on an Intel CPU or whatever.
[11010.96 → 11011.46] I just don't really.
[11011.48 → 11012.70] I feel like it was worse back in the day.
[11012.92 → 11013.24] Yeah.
[11013.58 → 11016.40] Or like what cheese melts best or whatever.
[11016.54 → 11020.12] Like I don't I don't see anybody actually being like that angry about anything that we talk about.
[11020.12 → 11022.30] I could see people being really very angry about.
[11022.38 → 11023.22] But like I.
[11025.82 → 11033.40] I got more like I can't even remember the last one at this point, but I got them relatively frequently back in the house.
[11033.40 → 11035.08] I would get like death threats and stuff.
[11035.08 → 11042.88] I remember somebody sent me like a long essay on how they with details of how they wanted to murder me because of a review I did on something back in the day.
[11043.06 → 11043.24] Nice.
[11043.78 → 11045.36] And I was like, that's nuts.
[11045.52 → 11046.48] They sound like a cool person.
[11046.56 → 11046.82] Yeah.
[11046.90 → 11048.30] I was like, that's probably not going to happen.
[11048.30 → 11050.64] They probably f***ed lots of women.
[11052.28 → 11052.72] Probably.
[11053.06 → 11053.50] Pillows.
[11054.00 → 11057.06] I mean, well, yeah, I didn't say they were real.
[11061.12 → 11062.06] Yeah, I don't know.
[11062.06 → 11063.26] I just kind of wrote it off.
[11063.26 → 11065.12] Trig says just don't talk about Boeing.
[11069.46 → 11071.34] Yeah, don't review a plane.
[11073.92 → 11075.74] Well, a Boeing plane, I guess.
[11075.84 → 11076.86] Yeah, not a Boeing plane.
[11077.12 → 11078.26] What about like a Desai plane?
[11078.94 → 11079.56] Just curious.
[11079.72 → 11081.28] I'm just, it's a random manufacturer.
[11081.86 → 11082.76] Pulled it out of thin air.
[11083.16 → 11083.36] Yeah.
[11083.88 → 11084.78] Sounds probably fine.
[11085.04 → 11085.48] Probably fine.
[11085.50 → 11085.84] Not big enough.
[11085.92 → 11086.82] Not murderous enough.
[11086.94 → 11087.16] Right.
[11087.24 → 11087.44] Okay.
[11087.52 → 11087.70] Yeah.
[11087.70 → 11087.86] Yeah.
[11087.86 → 11088.48] I'm just checking.
[11088.64 → 11088.80] Yeah.
[11089.24 → 11089.50] Yeah.
[11089.50 → 11089.86] Okay.
[11090.40 → 11090.64] Yeah.
[11092.28 → 11094.38] Hey, Dan Land and the man.
[11094.84 → 11095.92] Here's my interest.
[11096.16 → 11097.48] Hypothetically, a Falcon 50.
[11097.82 → 11098.72] Just hypothetically.
[11099.12 → 11099.80] Reviewing that?
[11099.94 → 11100.08] Yeah.
[11100.92 → 11102.18] Like if we made a video on that.
[11102.28 → 11103.64] I think that'd be pretty cool, actually.
[11103.64 → 11106.48] I don't think the company would try to murder you.
[11107.56 → 11113.06] I think it would be an interesting challenge from an artistic perspective to have you try
[11113.06 → 11116.96] to review something that is so traditionally outside your wheelhouse.
[11117.04 → 11117.58] Yeah, for sure.
[11118.52 → 11119.08] Your hanger.
[11119.58 → 11119.76] Yeah.
[11119.76 → 11120.58] Oh, I like that.
[11120.74 → 11121.22] There we go.
[11122.82 → 11124.40] It's a weird thing to call it, but sure.
[11132.10 → 11133.32] Sorry, go ahead, Dan.
[11133.38 → 11134.04] No, that's fine.
[11134.50 → 11135.42] Hey, Dan Land and the man.
[11135.48 → 11137.02] Here's my interest-free loan.
[11137.30 → 11140.74] How does Float plane differ from other creator-run content platforms?
[11140.86 → 11142.72] How is it better or worse than them?
[11142.96 → 11144.50] Can you guess who the man is?
[11146.74 → 11147.18] Luke?
[11147.60 → 11148.04] What?
[11148.04 → 11148.80] Sure.
[11149.04 → 11149.76] Let's go with Luke.
[11150.34 → 11151.40] Sorry, what was the thing?
[11152.08 → 11153.50] Dan Land and the man.
[11153.84 → 11156.58] They wanted us to guess who the man is, because Land could be either of us.
[11157.94 → 11158.66] I don't know.
[11159.54 → 11159.98] Oh, man.
[11160.14 → 11163.14] I saw you were ready for that one.
[11163.34 → 11164.70] Dude, that was so good.
[11164.72 → 11165.16] That was crazy.
[11166.16 → 11167.20] That was nuts.
[11167.20 → 11167.80] You nailed it.
[11168.02 → 11169.56] That was actually wild.
[11169.72 → 11171.98] Oh, man.
[11172.98 → 11173.98] That was awesome.
[11176.14 → 11177.24] This is a high note.
[11177.24 → 11178.36] Are there more merch messages?
[11178.46 → 11180.50] Because I just want to end the show now.
[11180.58 → 11181.52] That was awesome.
[11181.52 → 11182.34] That was pretty good.
[11182.54 → 11183.34] Wrap it up, everyone.
[11184.68 → 11186.32] Oh, that was great.
[11186.40 → 11186.74] No, no, no.
[11186.74 → 11187.62] We got a few more.
[11187.62 → 11187.86] Okay.
[11187.86 → 11188.52] We got a few more.
[11188.58 → 11189.22] We got a few more.
[11189.76 → 11190.16] Wow.
[11190.16 → 11190.92] Yeah.
[11190.92 → 11194.12] So how does Float plane differ from other creator-run content platforms?
[11194.12 → 11200.92] I wouldn't say that functionally it's that different, right?
[11201.08 → 11204.90] Like, it's a way to safeguard our income streams.
[11205.00 → 11208.50] You guys saw Float plane makes up, I think it's 7% of our total income.
[11208.50 → 11212.54] We're actually over 40,000 subscribers on Float plane right now.
[11212.74 → 11215.26] So thank you guys so much for your incredible support.
[11217.18 → 11222.06] It's a way of engaging more closely with our most committed community members.
[11222.18 → 11224.38] So it's awesome that way.
[11225.04 → 11228.84] You get, like, kind of extras in behind the scenes, a little bit of early access sprinkled
[11228.84 → 11232.56] in here and there, secret shoppers doing early access this time around on Float plane.
[11233.34 → 11236.74] So they all kind of, like, I would say, function the same way.
[11236.92 → 11239.62] But what I'd say is really cool about Float plane...
[11239.62 → 11240.12] Similar way.
[11240.40 → 11240.64] Yeah.
[11240.82 → 11241.00] Yeah.
[11241.16 → 11241.56] Similar ways.
[11241.56 → 11245.48] I think the main dividing line between the platforms is the subscription model.
[11245.88 → 11246.16] Sure.
[11246.32 → 11246.50] Yeah.
[11246.50 → 11251.08] Whether it's a subscription, like an all-you-can-eat for multiple creators or whether it's in-house
[11251.08 → 11256.22] for only one single creator, like we saw at Rooster Teeth, or whether it's kind of...
[11256.22 → 11260.90] I'd say we're, like, kind of hybrid where I'd say the closest thing we are to is something
[11260.90 → 11268.42] like a Patreon where you can sign up as a creator and then your money that you get from your subscribers
[11268.42 → 11269.72] is your money.
[11270.30 → 11275.78] Except the difference is that, you know, our fees are structured around being really...
[11276.50 → 11279.78] heavily focused on video content delivery.
[11280.58 → 11283.78] Those are also percentages and ours are flat rates.
[11283.94 → 11288.84] Like, there's little differences in the subscription model, but the overall flow of, like, come to
[11288.84 → 11291.50] platform, pay money, receive content...
[11292.14 → 11292.70] Pretty similar.
[11292.70 → 11292.80] Pretty similar.
[11292.80 → 11294.54] And not compete with YouTube.
[11295.02 → 11295.64] Yeah, yeah.
[11295.64 → 11297.32] It's something that they all have in common.
[11297.96 → 11301.64] But I would say the thing that sets us apart the most is our team.
[11301.82 → 11302.92] I think our team's super cool.
[11303.02 → 11304.50] I think our team's incredibly talented.
[11304.50 → 11304.94] Yeah.
[11305.30 → 11307.88] I'm not saying any of the other teams aren't cool or talented.
[11308.02 → 11309.34] I'm sure they're very cool and very talented.
[11309.58 → 11310.22] But we like ours.
[11310.32 → 11313.38] But we really are super, like, into ours.
[11313.56 → 11317.66] And I think it's really incredible what they've done on the technology side.
[11317.66 → 11319.66] Like, we...
[11319.66 → 11327.10] I think from the outside, you know, a lot of our stuff looks kind of basic sometimes.
[11327.72 → 11332.42] And we kind of honestly suck at some of the more business-y sides of things.
[11332.54 → 11334.52] Like, the fact that we still don't have, like, a trial.
[11334.98 → 11335.90] Sort of embarrassing.
[11336.36 → 11336.80] You know?
[11336.84 → 11337.50] Like, we know that.
[11338.46 → 11339.58] There are a few things like that.
[11339.60 → 11340.88] There are a few things like that.
[11340.88 → 11345.04] But in terms of, like, the player tech, it's, like, perfect.
[11345.58 → 11348.48] In terms of, like, the CDN...
[11348.48 → 11353.94] I don't even want to call it platform because it's more of, like, a...
[11353.94 → 11355.28] How would I even describe it?
[11355.28 → 11366.28] Like, the CDN web that exists to serve the video on the back end is, like, a combination of off-the-shelf and custom and...
[11366.84 → 11367.86] A couple of things.
[11367.96 → 11373.96] One, the player tech was mostly really fantastic a while ago.
[11374.06 → 11376.28] Like, I think we peaked in...
[11377.14 → 11379.38] I'm not very good with dates.
[11379.54 → 11382.00] I'm going to guess, like, 2018 with the colour thing.
[11382.32 → 11383.14] That was pretty cool.
[11383.36 → 11384.74] That was pretty wild.
[11384.74 → 11391.48] We were, like, legitimately the only ones able to serve full colour on Chrome and I think it was Firefox at the time.
[11391.48 → 11392.46] Yeah, non-Edge browsers.
[11392.66 → 11393.76] Yeah, like, it was weird.
[11393.92 → 11400.28] There was a situation where Netflix was advertising people watching Netflix in Edge.
[11401.52 → 11404.56] But that was not a thing that Microsoft was sponsoring them to do.
[11405.38 → 11409.12] They were telling people to watch it in Edge because it was the only way that you could get full colour.
[11409.30 → 11410.16] Like, proper colour.
[11410.34 → 11412.32] Like, it wasn't, like, washed out, or it wasn't, like, shifted.
[11412.44 → 11413.08] It was really weird.
[11413.08 → 11420.14] But while they were running those advertisements, we had a player that could play full colour in those other browsers, which was really sick.
[11420.54 → 11427.10] These days, we tend to give better quality video.
[11427.10 → 11432.44] But there isn't as much special differentiating sauce in the player.
[11432.52 → 11433.22] I'm just being honest.
[11433.56 → 11433.62] Yeah.
[11433.88 → 11435.64] And then what was the other thing that you said?
[11436.66 → 11437.28] There was the player.
[11437.52 → 11437.80] The CDN side.
[11437.84 → 11438.18] Oh, yeah.
[11438.24 → 11438.82] The CDN side.
[11438.90 → 11444.24] So we made this thing called Float CDN back in the day when it was a multi-CDN solution.
[11444.24 → 11447.88] So we could automatically kind of, like, switch between which one was the cheapest.
[11448.46 → 11451.62] The due to bargaining and whatnot.
[11451.62 → 11454.28] These days, it's, like, for GOD.
[11454.36 → 11455.86] It's, like, pretty much just Cloudflare.
[11456.08 → 11457.28] But we still have the tool.
[11457.56 → 11458.22] It just doesn't.
[11459.16 → 11461.72] And if our deal with Cloudflare changed.
[11461.80 → 11462.48] We can turn it on.
[11462.48 → 11464.24] Pray I don't alter it any further, you know.
[11464.24 → 11465.62] Then we have that.
[11465.76 → 11465.90] Yeah.
[11466.02 → 11469.20] Which is pretty cool because we were operating extremely bootstrap.
[11469.76 → 11476.76] And so just, I don't know, let's just hire someone who knows AWS and implement that.
[11476.82 → 11478.12] That was not an option.
[11478.28 → 11481.12] We needed to generate revenue month to month.
[11481.20 → 11483.78] I mean, it was an option if we just wanted to lose more money.
[11483.78 → 11491.22] No, well, I mean, it wasn't under the marching orders that you gave us at the time, which is still the marching orders that we have, which is that it needs to be resilient.
[11491.22 → 11501.36] One of your biggest things was, like, it needs to continue to exist because at that point in time, the biggest problem with these platforms is they'd pop up for a year, maybe a year and a half, maybe two years, and then die.
[11501.52 → 11502.54] And they would just disappear.
[11502.62 → 11506.52] And it was really frustrating for creators because you bring your audience to this thing.
[11506.64 → 11506.80] Yeah.
[11506.86 → 11508.98] And then it's just gone.
[11509.14 → 11517.80] And I actually forgot one of the other major pillars was no fang should be able to just arbitrarily decide that you don't exist anymore.
[11517.80 → 11518.18] Yeah.
[11518.18 → 11522.22] And that's a huge part of the way that float plane is architected.
[11522.50 → 11524.04] No fang company.
[11524.34 → 11526.10] And I guess fang's like the old one.
[11526.24 → 11527.02] Yeah, it's expanded.
[11527.26 → 11529.10] Marvellous 7 or whatever it is.
[11529.50 → 11532.46] Like, no one entity can just be like, yeah, no.
[11532.94 → 11536.60] And there's stuff where, like, OVH, for example.
[11536.78 → 11539.20] If OVH just pulled the plug, it would hurt.
[11540.30 → 11540.96] It would suck.
[11541.06 → 11541.88] We're not gone.
[11542.42 → 11544.32] We might be gone temporarily.
[11544.32 → 11547.16] Have we ever publicly acknowledged, like, how much of our hosting is in OVH?
[11548.10 → 11548.84] A lot of it is.
[11548.86 → 11549.32] It's not all.
[11549.50 → 11549.74] Okay.
[11549.80 → 11551.62] I'm just wondering if we've ever publicly acknowledged that.
[11551.66 → 11555.68] You used to be very squeamish about, like, talking about where anything was hosted or anything.
[11555.78 → 11557.00] Security through obscurity, I guess.
[11557.00 → 11558.44] I think I have mentioned it since.
[11558.68 → 11561.48] It's so, like, I don't love talking about this stuff.
[11561.88 → 11563.14] But it is very easy.
[11563.18 → 11564.82] Like, if someone's interested, you can figure that out.
[11565.04 → 11565.38] Okay, cool.
[11565.40 → 11565.94] Pretty easily.
[11566.28 → 11566.98] I'm just checking.
[11567.12 → 11569.12] I'm just, you know, I never know where your comfort zone is.
[11569.18 → 11570.86] Like, I actually messaged him earlier today.
[11571.24 → 11572.54] We had an old video idea.
[11572.66 → 11575.76] I've been going through our doc and kind of categorizing things.
[11575.98 → 11577.28] My answer is probably not.
[11577.34 → 11579.96] But honestly, just because it's less interesting these days.
[11580.36 → 11581.92] Like, that thing with the player.
[11581.96 → 11583.16] I think you underestimate.
[11583.44 → 11584.78] It used to be more interesting.
[11584.78 → 11587.50] We could include some of the history, which I think would be super cool.
[11587.58 → 11590.50] Because it's stuff we've, like, never talked about.
[11591.60 → 11594.50] And I think it would be a chance to highlight some of the accomplishments of that team,
[11594.58 → 11595.54] which I think would be super cool.
[11595.54 → 11596.38] Yeah, it could be pretty cool.
[11596.56 → 11598.02] See, I know how to tug on his heartstrings.
[11599.88 → 11601.14] I do like giving them shout-outs.
[11601.14 → 11603.54] I'm like the AI chatbot with the researchers.
[11603.76 → 11605.66] I've been thoroughly briefed on him.
[11606.08 → 11608.36] And I know which strings to pull.
[11608.98 → 11611.82] But think of highlighting your team and their accomplishments, Luke.
[11613.16 → 11614.66] I wasn't on board.
[11614.84 → 11616.84] I wasn't on board until he said that.
[11616.94 → 11618.18] And then, yeah, now I'm kind of down.
[11619.04 → 11621.40] But, yeah, no, we had an idea to just do, like, how does float?
[11621.50 → 11623.12] What the heck is float plane?
[11623.16 → 11624.50] And how does it actually work?
[11624.50 → 11626.86] There might be a perfect timing for this.
[11627.74 → 11629.32] Is that what made you think about it?
[11629.60 → 11630.60] That's part of it, yeah.
[11630.82 → 11631.52] Yeah, that makes sense.
[11632.88 → 11633.36] Okay.
[11634.52 → 11636.72] Is that a good enough answer on that?
[11637.72 → 11638.22] Cool.
[11638.44 → 11639.66] I forgot what the question was.
[11639.88 → 11641.32] But how float plane good.
[11641.70 → 11642.62] Okay, yeah, cool.
[11642.62 → 11644.72] Let's see.
[11645.86 → 11648.40] Dan, Luke Newcomb, and Linus.
[11648.94 → 11649.22] Linus.
[11649.28 → 11651.78] Have you ever considered using magnetic starting zippers?
[11652.92 → 11653.28] No.
[11653.92 → 11654.72] I've never heard of that.
[11655.88 → 11659.66] So they just, like, magnet together at the bottom, and then you zip it?
[11659.66 → 11668.94] Man, this really is feeling a little bit like a zipper magnet type.
[11669.04 → 11670.12] Okay, what am I looking at?
[11670.22 → 11671.68] PKK America's group.
[11672.30 → 11674.72] 1.39,000 subscribers.
[11676.46 → 11676.90] What?
[11677.60 → 11678.40] Oh, that's sick.
[11678.48 → 11678.80] What?
[11679.80 → 11680.48] That's...
[11680.48 → 11681.14] Sorry, what?
[11681.14 → 11685.52] Am I just being, like, old man yells at Cloud, like, this seems unnecessary?
[11685.92 → 11687.74] It does seem highly unnecessary.
[11688.42 → 11694.02] I think it helps people who maybe don't have the dexterity to be able to attach a zipper together.
[11694.16 → 11695.04] Oh, that makes sense.
[11695.56 → 11695.76] Hmm.
[11697.48 → 11698.42] Very wise of you, Dan.
[11700.66 → 11701.82] I've never seen one of these.
[11701.82 → 11702.92] I've never seen that before.
[11703.02 → 11704.90] That's kind of cool.
[11706.16 → 11711.10] No, I have never heard of that and never considered it, but I guess it's on my radar.
[11711.14 → 11712.14] Thank you.
[11713.76 → 11714.84] Hi, early.dll.
[11715.24 → 11720.72] Might be in, still in discussions or have yet to watch, delayed watch, but will the gift
[11720.72 → 11722.94] cards only be usable in the US store?
[11723.32 → 11725.12] Thanks and understand the headache.
[11725.18 → 11727.32] I believe there's an FAQ.
[11729.84 → 11731.22] Oops, sorry, that's old.
[11733.06 → 11734.28] Let me split into two.
[11734.34 → 11735.28] Yeah, here we go.
[11735.70 → 11737.14] Control F, gift.
[11738.44 → 11740.06] I live outside, want to sing.
[11740.06 → 11742.48] What will happen to gift cards on LTT store?
[11742.86 → 11746.64] If you live in the United States, your existing gift cards will remain usable as before.
[11746.98 → 11750.44] If you live elsewhere in the world, your gift card will be moved to global.lttstore.com
[11750.44 → 11753.22] and the amount will be adjusted to reflect the current USD CAD exchange rate.
[11753.58 → 11755.50] Please note that this migration may take some time to complete.
[11755.62 → 11759.36] We anticipate that all gift cards should be migrated by May the 9th, 2025.
[11759.36 → 11765.20] When purchasing gift cards in the future, ensure your gift card matches the region of the purchase
[11765.20 → 11768.02] of the person you intend to send the gift card to.
[11768.10 → 11771.96] For example, if you live in the United States, but want to send a gift card to a friend in
[11771.96 → 11772.46] Canada.
[11772.46 → 11777.10] Hello, Dennis, Take, and Wanna.
[11777.62 → 11781.50] I want to replace my router without reconnecting all my devices.
[11781.90 → 11782.68] How can I do this?
[11782.96 → 11784.84] I looked on the LTT forum and didn't see anything.
[11785.18 → 11788.34] Theoretically, you can just change the SSID and the password to the same thing that they
[11788.34 → 11788.98] were before.
[11789.18 → 11791.16] In practice, I found it doesn't always work.
[11791.42 → 11791.84] Good luck.
[11792.50 → 11794.04] Which would be a good thing.
[11794.04 → 11798.02] But not a convenient thing.
[11798.26 → 11798.46] True.
[11798.90 → 11799.26] Ever.
[11799.50 → 11800.70] But you don't want that to happen.
[11800.94 → 11802.10] Just being clear.
[11803.42 → 11804.28] Hey, guys.
[11804.50 → 11806.82] Luke, what is usually breakfast of choice?
[11807.24 → 11807.84] Chicken breast.
[11808.12 → 11808.38] Nothing.
[11809.24 → 11810.04] That's terrible.
[11810.38 → 11811.16] I tend to skip breakfast.
[11811.36 → 11811.70] Black coffee.
[11811.70 → 11812.16] Yeah, me too.
[11813.02 → 11813.56] Black coffee.
[11813.80 → 11814.50] I don't drink coffee.
[11814.56 → 11816.30] I microwaved a corn on the cob this morning.
[11817.96 → 11819.64] I felt that in my soul.
[11821.76 → 11822.20] What?
[11822.20 → 11824.02] Corn is a delicious and nutritious snack any time.
[11824.02 → 11825.20] No, just like the vibe.
[11826.08 → 11827.60] Just like me.
[11828.06 → 11829.14] It's a bit of a rough.
[11829.14 → 11831.94] My wife doesn't love me, so I put corn in the microwave.
[11833.48 → 11834.84] No, I'm kidding.
[11834.92 → 11835.22] I'm kidding.
[11835.28 → 11835.60] She does.
[11835.72 → 11837.50] No, I'm a heathen and I don't like eggs.
[11837.62 → 11838.46] I wish I did.
[11839.20 → 11839.64] Actually, no.
[11839.70 → 11840.34] That wasn't today.
[11840.42 → 11840.90] But I don't.
[11840.98 → 11843.04] Today, I had a dentist appointment in the morning and I couldn't eat.
[11844.56 → 11845.86] I guess I could have, but I didn't.
[11845.86 → 11847.66] Most breakfast food I'm not into.
[11847.74 → 11849.82] I love cereal, but cereal is like sugar.
[11849.86 → 11851.00] Cereal is like a dessert food.
[11851.00 → 11852.64] Cereal is actual sugar.
[11852.74 → 11853.72] Starting your day with dessert.
[11853.86 → 11854.94] Maybe not the best start.
[11855.08 → 11858.86] Yeah, I haven't finished it yet, but I've read a considerable amount of sugar, salt, and fat.
[11859.06 → 11860.08] Or salt, sugar, fat.
[11860.14 → 11860.30] Whatever.
[11860.40 → 11860.84] That book.
[11861.14 → 11868.16] That's basically about how big food, especially in the 90s, basically was like,
[11868.22 → 11869.26] ah, f*** all of you.
[11869.44 → 11873.38] And put sugar in everything until we all got diabetes.
[11873.38 → 11878.92] What happens when we subsidize corn and people make corn syrup?
[11879.46 → 11880.96] What happens now?
[11881.44 → 11885.44] It wasn't even, it's honestly, it's not even that conspiracy theory.
[11885.70 → 11891.24] They just like discovered the bliss point, essentially, in food engineering.
[11891.52 → 11895.96] And we're like, oh, so we can just put more of this in it.
[11895.96 → 11899.70] And then people will literally start to develop addictive behaviours around our food.
[11899.80 → 11900.36] It's wild.
[11900.88 → 11901.76] What stuff?
[11901.76 → 11904.44] Like when you read labels and things like beef jerky.
[11904.82 → 11906.48] Why does beef jerky have sugar in it?
[11906.52 → 11906.74] Yeah.
[11907.16 → 11907.60] It seems weird.
[11907.60 → 11908.22] Because it's delicious.
[11908.32 → 11910.02] I assumed it would be salt and beef.
[11910.02 → 11915.84] Dude, they literally hooked up like brainwave monitoring crap on kids and then gave them like
[11915.84 → 11920.44] dozens of formulations of Oreos and then saw which one lit up the pleasure centres the most.
[11920.44 → 11922.56] And then we're like, that one.
[11923.32 → 11924.04] That makes sense.
[11924.32 → 11924.66] Oh, yeah.
[11925.80 → 11926.98] Meat plus sugar is good, though.
[11927.28 → 11927.88] Literally, though.
[11928.42 → 11928.94] Damn, dude.
[11929.50 → 11931.14] We have way too much sugar.
[11931.66 → 11932.10] Yep.
[11932.48 → 11932.82] All right.
[11933.28 → 11934.18] Hi, LDL.
[11934.30 → 11934.86] Love the show.
[11935.10 → 11936.10] Been watching for years.
[11936.50 → 11938.06] Professional curiosity here.
[11938.24 → 11941.46] But do you know what data visualization software you use at LTT?
[11941.68 → 11941.88] Nope.
[11944.14 → 11945.58] Data visualization software?
[11946.38 → 11949.90] I wasn't sure if they were talking about graphs or anything else.
[11949.90 → 11951.82] Because, wow, we use a bunch, to be honest.
[11953.58 → 11955.44] Grafana is the first one that jumps to mind.
[11955.54 → 11955.80] Cool.
[11955.90 → 11958.02] Because we use it in multiple parts of the company.
[11960.00 → 11962.16] High charts is...
[11962.16 → 11963.02] Is it high charts?
[11963.12 → 11963.98] I'm pretty sure it's high charts.
[11964.28 → 11966.26] It's the one that we use for the labs' website.
[11967.02 → 11969.34] If you can't remember, maybe you're using it too much.
[11970.00 → 11970.90] Using it too much.
[11970.98 → 11971.16] Yeah.
[11971.20 → 11972.18] That's why you can't remember.
[11972.34 → 11972.48] Yeah.
[11972.50 → 11972.88] High charts.
[11974.20 → 11974.56] Oh.
[11976.18 → 11976.94] Ding him, Dan.
[11977.70 → 11978.78] You had to get it first.
[11979.90 → 11981.42] Delayed notification.
[11981.98 → 11982.84] Come on.
[11983.76 → 11985.48] And there are a bunch of other ones.
[11986.80 → 11987.16] Diana.
[11988.04 → 11990.16] That name rings too much of a bell.
[11990.24 → 11990.82] I'm sure that's somewhere.
[11992.10 → 11992.98] There's so many.
[11993.40 → 11994.24] There's so many.
[11994.40 → 11996.62] I mean, if you go on the infrastructure side, there's like a trillion.
[11997.34 → 11997.58] Oh.
[11997.76 → 12001.46] Because, like, this one or that one's better at this thing or that thing and whatever else.
[12002.50 → 12003.28] I don't know.
[12003.28 → 12005.76] We even make our own sometimes.
[12006.54 → 12007.02] Tool jet.
[12008.30 → 12009.52] You got that going on.
[12009.90 → 12010.76] Could you count Airtable?
[12010.88 → 12011.18] Probably.
[12011.54 → 12012.18] Yeah, I think so.
[12012.32 → 12014.18] Yeah, it's got a chart in it.
[12014.26 → 12014.52] Oh, yeah.
[12014.74 → 12015.20] We have data.
[12015.68 → 12016.70] Count Google Sheets.
[12016.88 → 12017.86] Freaking everything, man.
[12017.92 → 12018.18] Yeah.
[12018.30 → 12019.34] Like, my goodness.
[12019.70 → 12020.10] I don't know.
[12021.30 → 12022.80] D3JS and Charts sometimes.
[12022.92 → 12023.54] Google Sheets charts.
[12023.66 → 12023.80] Yeah.
[12023.94 → 12025.18] Conrad threw those in.
[12025.34 → 12025.82] Yeah, man.
[12025.90 → 12026.60] There's like...
[12026.60 → 12026.98] I don't know.
[12027.06 → 12027.46] Name it.
[12028.66 → 12029.84] We probably use it somewhere.
[12029.84 → 12034.12] Aloha, DLL.
[12034.30 → 12040.18] I remember a while ago mentioning a video about a Steam Deck as a daily desktop computer.
[12040.28 → 12041.00] Did that ever release?
[12041.32 → 12044.70] I don't think we ever, like, committed to daily driving it.
[12044.84 → 12050.20] But we did do this one where we compared it to a PC for about the same price from, like,
[12050.22 → 12053.94] a performance and general usage standpoint.
[12054.84 → 12055.88] So, that was pretty cool.
[12056.80 → 12057.96] So, you could kind of check that out.
[12057.96 → 12059.96] So, if you get your beard back...
[12061.44 → 12062.62] Oh, yeah.
[12062.66 → 12063.86] I've made progress, Dan.
[12064.00 → 12065.48] And grow your hair a little bit.
[12065.52 → 12069.90] I am going to complete my bike before Luke finishes Final Fantasy VI.
[12070.24 → 12071.74] That's very exciting.
[12072.02 → 12072.58] I am.
[12072.72 → 12073.28] I will.
[12073.52 → 12074.22] Check this out.
[12074.40 → 12074.96] I have real...
[12076.54 → 12077.96] I've progressed.
[12078.10 → 12078.50] Have you?
[12078.66 → 12081.06] I didn't tell you when you told me about your bike thing.
[12081.28 → 12083.04] Because I didn't know if you're going to mention it on a Sancho or not.
[12083.16 → 12083.68] But I have progressed.
[12083.68 → 12084.18] You piece of s***.
[12084.18 → 12086.26] I progressed before you sent me the bike stuff.
[12086.58 → 12086.94] Uh-oh.
[12086.94 → 12087.06] Oh.
[12087.26 → 12087.62] Okay.
[12087.76 → 12088.48] It's on now.
[12088.48 → 12088.78] It's still on.
[12089.38 → 12090.10] It's on.
[12090.24 → 12092.64] Oh, that's the wrong person whose name starts with a D.
[12092.76 → 12093.46] Hold on one second.
[12093.62 → 12096.06] And I'm going on a trip soon with a lot of long flights.
[12096.96 → 12097.74] Are they hard?
[12098.84 → 12100.14] Are they long and hard?
[12100.38 → 12101.08] They've got it.
[12101.16 → 12103.40] Technically, the plane, it has some girth to it.
[12103.46 → 12104.36] And it is a tube.
[12104.96 → 12106.60] Can't even get both your hands around it.
[12106.90 → 12107.14] No.
[12107.24 → 12108.34] It's just factually correct.
[12109.08 → 12110.00] But who makes it?
[12110.04 → 12110.66] Is it Dassault?
[12111.02 → 12111.38] Oh.
[12111.84 → 12112.64] I'm just curious.
[12112.64 → 12113.48] It's hypothetical.
[12113.48 → 12116.48] Probably not in this case.
[12116.56 → 12117.04] Probably not.
[12117.26 → 12118.20] Yeah, probably not.
[12118.22 → 12120.42] Probably, very likely Boeing.
[12121.32 → 12121.80] Oh.
[12122.16 → 12123.04] Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[12123.08 → 12124.08] You should get one that's straight.
[12126.64 → 12127.12] Sure.
[12128.44 → 12128.92] Sure.
[12129.08 → 12130.46] There's a stretch there, bud.
[12131.40 → 12131.80] Whoa.
[12132.18 → 12132.80] That looks nice.
[12132.86 → 12139.70] It was determined that if you deal with stocks while you're on a plane that is actively crashing,
[12139.70 → 12140.70] it's not insider trading.
[12140.94 → 12141.16] Really?
[12141.48 → 12141.82] Yes.
[12143.88 → 12147.36] So if you're like on a Boeing and the door flies off and your plane's going to crash.
[12147.48 → 12148.34] You should sell.
[12148.44 → 12149.94] You could whip the laptop out.
[12150.56 → 12151.16] Short Boeing.
[12151.26 → 12152.02] And buy shorts.
[12152.48 → 12152.82] Okay.
[12155.14 → 12156.86] Only if the Inflate Wi-Fi works.
[12157.32 → 12158.18] I have her.
[12158.80 → 12159.66] Oh, I did it wrong.
[12159.86 → 12160.30] Go, go.
[12160.42 → 12160.92] Their bike.
[12161.36 → 12161.84] Okay.
[12161.84 → 12169.76] So what we're looking at here is every piece of the bike at a minimum primed.
[12170.72 → 12172.82] Do you need multiple coats of priming?
[12174.58 → 12176.72] Because they look like they're in different states.
[12177.00 → 12178.54] So the primer is gray.
[12179.58 → 12179.90] Okay.
[12180.06 → 12184.62] So what we're looking at right now is everything completed priming.
[12184.88 → 12185.24] Okay.
[12185.24 → 12188.90] So that's like a DTM direct to metal, uh, metal primer.
[12189.18 → 12191.36] And then Dan, what are you doing, bud?
[12191.46 → 12192.96] Well, now you can talk about it and they can see you.
[12192.96 → 12193.68] Keep moving it.
[12193.82 → 12194.00] Yeah.
[12194.00 → 12194.42] No, no, no, no.
[12194.42 → 12194.82] Keep it.
[12194.88 → 12195.36] Keep it big.
[12195.48 → 12195.84] Keep it big.
[12195.96 → 12196.26] We got to see.
[12196.28 → 12196.52] All right.
[12196.56 → 12196.66] Fine.
[12196.82 → 12197.04] Okay.
[12197.04 → 12201.52] Some of the pieces are fully coated in white.
[12201.64 → 12204.18] I need white in order to get a vibrant pink.
[12204.28 → 12208.48] I discovered this when I was doing the many experiments that I've done over the last couple
[12208.48 → 12208.78] of years.
[12208.90 → 12215.42] So I need a nice, even vibrant white in order to get a nice, even vibrant pink, which is
[12215.42 → 12216.16] what I'm going for.
[12216.62 → 12223.38] Um, so there are a couple of pieces in between the two, uh, wheels that are done, done in the
[12223.38 → 12223.62] white.
[12223.62 → 12231.42] Um, however, a lot of my white stuff that I have coated either had like issues with the
[12231.42 → 12236.22] coating because I had not really gotten good with the white paint yet, or, um, has been
[12236.22 → 12241.72] damaged because I didn't actually have my setup such that I could hang every single piece at
[12241.72 → 12242.36] once before.
[12242.56 → 12248.24] And that caused a ton of problems for me, like just a ton of rework and resending and
[12248.24 → 12250.32] recording and then doing it again.
[12250.32 → 12256.02] Um, so I finally just put another, another rack in there so I can actually hang every single
[12256.02 → 12257.66] piece of it all at the same time now.
[12258.22 → 12262.30] Um, some, so some of them, so you can see on the front, uh, fairing there on the far
[12262.30 → 12263.52] left, top, top left.
[12263.72 → 12263.90] Yeah.
[12264.08 → 12267.72] Um, there's like some blasted bits of primer over top of the white.
[12267.86 → 12268.26] Yeah.
[12268.32 → 12272.58] That's areas where the white was damaged, or the coverage wasn't very good.
[12272.66 → 12273.32] And I need to hit it again.
[12273.32 → 12274.80] The close left portion.
[12274.94 → 12275.74] Is that shadow?
[12275.92 → 12276.12] No.
[12276.64 → 12277.76] So that's primer spray.
[12277.76 → 12277.92] Yeah.
[12277.92 → 12281.54] That's a quick spray of primer over a spot that was down to the bare plastic on that
[12281.54 → 12281.62] one.
[12281.62 → 12281.80] Yeah.
[12281.80 → 12284.04] Because I could tell in some other spots, but there I wasn't sure.
[12284.86 → 12292.60] Um, and then I am going to be, so the next stage is I'm going to be doing like a quick
[12292.60 → 12296.42] touch up blast of white on some of the ones that just were spot primed.
[12296.42 → 12300.92] Then I'm going to be doing a full coat of white on any of the ones that are gray.
[12301.06 → 12304.12] So those are mostly the ones centre frame and at the bottom left rack.
[12304.86 → 12310.56] Then I will do a full finish, a second coat of white on all the ones that just were like
[12310.56 → 12312.72] spot primed or a spot whited.
[12313.26 → 12316.66] Um, and then I will do a second coat of white on the ones that just got their first coat
[12316.66 → 12317.00] of white.
[12317.00 → 12322.72] And that'll be like probably a three-hour session, three and a half hour session.
[12322.72 → 12324.38] And then everything will be white.
[12325.28 → 12328.98] Are you still committed to growing the beard back out once you're done?
[12329.12 → 12330.98] I'll be up to Yvonne, just like it always is.
[12331.02 → 12331.26] Sure.
[12331.38 → 12331.56] Fair enough.
[12331.56 → 12334.60] Um, so after white, so hold on, bring the picture back, bring the picture back.
[12335.14 → 12343.14] So after white, the next thing that I need to do is spray the wheels pink, specifically
[12343.14 → 12346.60] the wheels, um, both sides.
[12347.86 → 12349.88] Then I need to mask.
[12350.06 → 12352.80] You can actually, oh, I don't know if you can see it on the picture.
[12352.92 → 12355.90] That picture is there to be my inspiration in the top middle.
[12356.84 → 12357.20] Okay.
[12357.28 → 12357.44] Yeah.
[12357.44 → 12357.54] Yeah.
[12357.54 → 12358.04] I got a zoom.
[12358.44 → 12359.12] I'm zooming.
[12359.38 → 12359.58] Zoom.
[12360.36 → 12361.06] Is this going to work?
[12361.68 → 12361.92] Okay.
[12361.98 → 12365.56] Oh, you can, you can't really see it, but each of the I want each of the wheels to have
[12365.56 → 12368.00] a pink stripe around it.
[12368.22 → 12372.04] So what I'm going to do is I'm going to paint them pink, but like minimally, I'm only going
[12372.04 → 12375.28] to be focused on the area where like the stripe is, as long as I can get a nice, even
[12375.28 → 12375.62] coat.
[12376.24 → 12380.02] Then I tape that off and paint the whole wheel black.
[12380.66 → 12382.64] Oh, then I clear coat.
[12382.94 → 12385.72] Oh, that's going to look sick.
[12385.78 → 12386.40] It's going to look awesome.
[12386.62 → 12387.04] So good.
[12387.16 → 12388.18] That's going to look great.
[12388.26 → 12388.58] Let's hope.
[12388.64 → 12392.84] I thought you were going to say green, and I was like, I get it, but like, no, no, it's
[12392.84 → 12393.60] going to be pink and black.
[12393.68 → 12393.94] Yeah.
[12394.30 → 12396.12] And it's like a super cool pink.
[12396.24 → 12396.84] That's sweet.
[12396.84 → 12403.00] It has like, um, it has like a like an effect, um, crap that they add to it.
[12403.02 → 12407.92] I mean, it's so long since I did all the yeah, like a flaking or pearlescent thing.
[12408.08 → 12408.48] Pearl.
[12408.62 → 12409.02] It's a pearl.
[12409.12 → 12410.78] It's like a, like a purple pearl.
[12410.98 → 12414.60] So in the light, it'll kind of catch it and like turn kind of blue purple.
[12414.72 → 12415.24] Oh, cool.
[12415.42 → 12416.76] Um, that'll be sweet.
[12416.86 → 12417.06] Yeah.
[12417.08 → 12418.46] I'm pretty, I'm pretty excited.
[12418.56 → 12419.24] Worth the no beard.
[12419.24 → 12428.06] Um, and then honestly, I think that it's going to be a very imperfect job, but I think I just
[12428.06 → 12428.78] accept that now.
[12429.60 → 12438.04] Like what I've discovered is that I picked basically hard mode by doing a so, so what
[12438.04 → 12438.36] is this?
[12438.36 → 12445.24] So prime, prime, white, white, maybe third coat, white, depending on my coverage, two
[12445.24 → 12449.90] coats, pink, two coats effect layers, and then two to three coats of clear coat.
[12450.04 → 12457.60] So this is anywhere from an 11 to 12 layer process on parts that have extremely irregular
[12457.60 → 12458.32] shapes.
[12459.28 → 12466.56] Um, it's basically like a nightmare paint job, which I didn't fully understand, uh, to go
[12466.56 → 12467.38] back and do it again.
[12467.62 → 12471.06] I definitely would have just done a solid colour with no pearl and no nothing.
[12471.06 → 12472.74] But at this point I'm, I'm locked.
[12472.74 → 12478.50] So I think that it probably won't look that good if you look closely, but as long as it's
[12478.50 → 12483.12] like a realistically, if I'm riding safely, nobody should be within about 10 feet of my
[12483.12 → 12483.60] bike anyway.
[12483.80 → 12487.38] So that's 10 foot job.
[12489.30 → 12490.12] That's all I got.
[12490.66 → 12491.10] Pause.
[12492.02 → 12492.46] Okay.
[12492.90 → 12498.00] I mean, no, that's, oh my, that just made it so much worse.
[12498.58 → 12499.70] So much worse.
[12499.80 → 12500.30] I don't even know what's coming.
[12500.48 → 12500.78] Don't.
[12500.94 → 12501.64] Oh my.
[12501.64 → 12503.08] God.
[12503.82 → 12504.68] Stop the show.
[12504.80 → 12505.34] Show us.
[12505.52 → 12506.26] Show us Luke.
[12506.42 → 12507.62] Oh my God.
[12508.50 → 12509.46] What's in your sag?
[12510.80 → 12511.46] Come on, pull it out.
[12511.58 → 12511.94] Come on.
[12513.02 → 12514.00] No, it's, oh.
[12514.80 → 12515.04] Yeah.
[12515.06 → 12517.16] It's because I was grabbing something from the bag.
[12517.22 → 12517.60] Yeah, he was.
[12518.42 → 12519.38] Is that what you call it?
[12520.86 → 12521.64] Bag of tricks.
[12523.34 → 12525.02] So you need all your cash for, right?
[12525.02 → 12530.44] He doesn't know.
[12530.44 → 12530.72] I know.
[12530.80 → 12531.30] He knows.
[12531.44 → 12533.24] That's why he kept it going for so long.
[12533.38 → 12535.02] I have no idea what you're talking about.
[12536.46 → 12537.08] Wait, really?
[12537.98 → 12538.28] I don't.
[12538.36 → 12538.56] Yeah.
[12538.56 → 12539.12] I also don't.
[12539.38 → 12540.02] His lying.
[12540.18 → 12540.66] His lying.
[12540.66 → 12541.38] No, it's really not.
[12541.44 → 12543.40] I actually have no idea what you're talking about.
[12543.46 → 12544.02] I don't believe him.
[12544.26 → 12547.48] Well, you mean, like, do I know about that I'm intending?
[12547.60 → 12547.84] Yeah.
[12548.04 → 12548.32] Oh, yeah.
[12548.44 → 12548.76] Yeah.
[12548.98 → 12549.06] Yeah.
[12549.06 → 12549.32] No, no.
[12549.32 → 12549.90] I have no idea.
[12550.00 → 12550.24] I was.
[12550.30 → 12551.02] No, I wasn't lying.
[12551.10 → 12552.64] I was saying I had no idea what's in your bag.
[12552.74 → 12553.06] I don't know.
[12553.06 → 12555.94] No, that's just, I want you to look at one more thing after the show on my laptop.
[12556.80 → 12557.74] That's completely unrelated.
[12557.90 → 12558.02] Oh, what?
[12558.06 → 12558.88] Like, after the show?
[12559.12 → 12559.36] Yeah.
[12559.52 → 12562.38] Wait, you're stalling the end of the show so that you can tell me that you want to talk?
[12562.38 → 12562.72] You're stalling the end of the show.
[12562.94 → 12564.32] No, I thought you were saying.
[12564.32 → 12564.92] Now I'm being gaslit.
[12564.94 → 12566.52] I thought you told them they had one more thing.
[12566.78 → 12567.50] No, no, no, no.
[12567.64 → 12568.80] Bear with me on this one.
[12568.80 → 12568.96] I said one more thing.
[12568.96 → 12569.86] You said pause.
[12569.96 → 12570.84] You said pause.
[12571.04 → 12573.54] No, I said pause because he said foot job.
[12574.50 → 12575.34] Foot job?
[12575.56 → 12575.96] Yeah.
[12576.90 → 12578.64] Did I say foot job?
[12579.28 → 12580.36] Ten foot job.
[12580.36 → 12584.44] Oh, come on!
[12585.84 → 12587.54] That wasn't even intentional.
[12587.72 → 12589.40] What are you even talking about?
[12589.46 → 12590.60] I want to go home!
[12590.96 → 12591.28] I want to go home!
[12591.28 → 12596.64] So basically, you just gigantically cock-teased them for no reason.
[12597.00 → 12597.70] Oh, my God!
[12597.70 → 12598.24] No, they got it!
[12598.30 → 12599.76] I got excited for nothing!
[12599.90 → 12600.58] Chad understood!
[12600.92 → 12602.78] No, they thought there was another thing!
[12602.80 → 12603.68] No, Chad understood!
[12603.98 → 12605.90] Well, I mean, we're probably both right.
[12608.42 → 12609.78] Alright, well, we'll see you then.
[12609.78 → 12610.66] Next week!
[12611.00 → 12612.66] Same bad time, same bad channel!
[12613.22 → 12613.60] Bye!
[12613.60 → 12619.60] Hi!
[12619.60 → 12623.60] I
[12623.60 → 12639.60] realize that they're
[12639.60 → 12642.60] very short and I think you're not gonna care, but I still want you to see it anyway.
[12642.60 → 12646.16] thing for the all hands
