[0.00 --> 5.44]  everybody and welcome to the wan show it's going to be a great show today is what i would say
[5.44 --> 16.58]  if microsoft hadn't done the unthinkable the appalling the inexcusable thing that they did
[16.58 --> 24.28]  i'm actually genuinely upset about it they have killed the blue screen of death how can you how
[24.28 --> 29.26]  can one kill death doesn't make any sense we'll be talking about that we're also going to be
[29.26 --> 34.54]  talking about some additional issues this week that house fresh who you guys may remember if you
[34.54 --> 42.54]  watched the big video this week that we did on uh companies suing honest reviewers that house fresh
[42.54 --> 48.90]  um highlighted where basically as far as we can tell independent review sites like theirs
[48.90 --> 54.86]  could be headed for yet another kick in the teeth while they're down what else we got this week
[54.86 --> 59.70]  any good news oh that can't be good news you already said enough words that i know it's not
[59.70 --> 65.36]  good news but sure do go on it might not even be news to be completely honest the trump phone no
[65.36 --> 72.70]  longer promises that it's made in america and also somebody made their own version of a steam controller
[72.70 --> 77.58]  pretty cool that's good news that's fun that's positive
[77.58 --> 101.86]  the show is brought to you today by oh i did it a little early rove lab proton and thorum of course
[101.86 --> 109.14]  alongside our wrap partner dbrand our laptop partner uh dell and our chair partner secret lab
[109.14 --> 117.12]  let's jump right into what is of course the big news this week microsoft has killed the bsod
[117.12 --> 126.04]  and introduced the bsod that's right after nearly 40 years of blue screens except for that short period
[126.04 --> 130.94]  with windows vista but nobody remembers that microsoft has decided that they want to and this is a quote
[130.94 --> 139.86]  improve clarity and provide better information on their kernel panic error screen so gone is the blue
[139.86 --> 149.22]  screen of death and in is the black screen of death which will now list the stop code and the application
[149.22 --> 157.94]  that triggered it but riddle me this mr luke lafreniere what if anything would have prevented microsoft
[157.94 --> 165.14]  from literally putting that information on a blue screen yeah they didn't have to make literally any
[165.14 --> 169.24]  changes other than just adding information that should have been there for the last
[169.24 --> 174.14]  entire amount of time this is just dumb
[174.14 --> 183.50]  i am actually more annoyed than i should be but very annoyed well i for one am actually pretty happy
[183.50 --> 188.44]  about at least part of this um the oh yeah the more information is good yeah the more information
[188.44 --> 195.90]  is a huge plus i mean the number of times that i have encountered an error on a windows-based system
[195.90 --> 206.02]  and had it just say you know error uh handling at the you know zero x zero x eight three two two
[206.02 --> 211.92]  and you google it and it's just like there's no information it's like brother yeah if you know
[211.92 --> 219.66]  what caused the crash which you must because there's some kind of code that has to indicate something
[219.66 --> 227.02]  tell me and a lot of the time you know i still remember the first time i fired up the reliability
[227.02 --> 235.20]  uh history and the um what's the other one so there's reliability monitor and performance monitor
[235.20 --> 240.52]  has some reliability stuff in it as well but the first time i fired up reliability history and i was
[240.52 --> 248.76]  like oh my god it just tells you in plain text this was caused by your nvidia driver thank you why
[248.76 --> 253.66]  wouldn't it just why wouldn't it just say that right on the crash screen where any user would know where
[253.66 --> 259.82]  to find it like that's a huge plus i'm actually i'm actually i'm super down with pretty stoked on
[259.82 --> 263.90]  like you're you're taking it i just hate when companies take like
[263.90 --> 275.22]  everyone liked this i mean no one liked you know getting a blue screen no but they liked that it
[275.22 --> 281.90]  was the blue screen it was part of the culture and you know what microsoft i i actually i actually
[281.90 --> 287.54]  really loved when we went from the old blue screen of death the little unhappy face was awesome
[287.54 --> 295.94]  to the little unhappy face um i i liked that they added the progress bar for sure uh for uh dumping the
[295.94 --> 301.48]  the error just add the info to this and and and the funny thing is they actually like have always had
[301.48 --> 307.48]  some information about the error so and it's actually yeah here as well that's a really bad
[307.48 --> 312.52]  screenshot that we can't really like see but but there is information they had a qr code um
[312.52 --> 318.72]  i don't really see the point of losing the iconic blue color just don't change the color the rest of
[318.72 --> 325.20]  it's great i have no issues like please yes add more information fantastic if the title was microsoft
[325.20 --> 332.00]  upgrades the blue screen of death it would have just been awesome yeah yeah yeah it would have been
[332.00 --> 337.18]  great news i mean every time microsoft has upgraded core operating system utilities things like task
[337.18 --> 344.60]  manager yeah i i think i think we've met those changes with um extreme positivity in fact i was dude
[344.60 --> 348.24]  i was back on an older version i forget what version of windows i was on but i was on an older version
[348.24 --> 352.56]  of windows that doesn't have a lot of the new quality of life features of the current task manager
[352.56 --> 359.52]  new task manager is way better i was like man search dude this sucks search is like fantastic
[359.52 --> 367.42]  what search in task manager on windows oh jeez oh no no no no no no only in the task i thought you
[367.42 --> 373.94]  meant windows search i was like brother are you actually high it's what are you talking it's not even
[373.94 --> 380.06]  april the 20th like what are you even doing right now no yeah just the task manager a really old
[380.06 --> 385.90]  task manager didn't have search oh yeah no for sure yeah luke rage baiting a hundred percent i wasn't
[385.90 --> 392.30]  trying to okay our discussion question and i want to get into this because i actually think that our
[392.30 --> 399.22]  writing team is on to something here please read entire question before reading please read entire
[399.22 --> 406.92]  question before reading please read entire question before reading
[406.92 --> 417.56]  these are my instructions so i'm gonna ignore them microsoft seems scared of their own janky legacy
[417.56 --> 424.42]  reading aloud when we were working on the one word when we were working on the altair sleeper build
[424.42 --> 432.62]  the brand asked us not to use clippy in it because of clippy's kind of controversial history
[432.62 --> 438.58]  uh but the thing that microsoft or at least the thing you got to understand microsoft huge company
[438.58 --> 444.14]  so there's going to be people at microsoft that totally get it all the way to people at microsoft
[444.14 --> 449.62]  who don't get it at all and most people are going to land somewhere in between so the particular person
[449.62 --> 453.62]  we were talking with which i who i think actually worked for an agency for microsoft not even microsoft
[453.62 --> 459.98]  directly tried to talk us out of putting clippy in that altair build but the thing that they didn't
[459.98 --> 464.70]  seem to be attuned to is that culture moves a little bit faster than corporate policy
[464.70 --> 471.70]  and people actually like clippy now clippy is like people like the prequels now kitschy and retro like
[471.70 --> 480.32]  if microsoft seriously if microsoft made like a desk ornament oh giant paper clip with googly eyes and a
[480.32 --> 486.74]  smile that you could just have as like decor in in your home office or whatever people would
[486.74 --> 493.00]  legitimately buy that like if they did a limited edition clippy statue i clippy holds a special place
[493.00 --> 500.60]  dude yeah of course dude would you would you consider would you consider like uh like uh you know
[500.60 --> 505.08]  those little vinyl figurines like little collectible vinyl figurines sure you don't buy anything but put
[505.08 --> 510.52]  yourself in the mindset of someone who buys a thing elijah okay sure would you okay but can't be
[510.52 --> 515.24]  elijah because he's too young to remember any of this stuff remember the like the little dog
[515.24 --> 521.70]  in the windows xp search yeah that would like go get things for you yeah yeah would you buy like
[521.70 --> 529.70]  vinyl figures of the various xp like search mascots and stuff like that okay so no collectible would
[529.70 --> 535.00]  that be as we've established i don't really buy stuff but if they're like you know we did a long
[535.00 --> 540.42]  time ago we had like a desk budget yeah yeah if i had a desk budget absolutely i would buy that for
[540.42 --> 545.04]  my work desk yeah the dog the wizard the little dog the wizard the little dog the wizard and clippy
[545.04 --> 551.64]  as like a trio would go so hard that would be so cool i was reminiscing about the install wizard like
[551.64 --> 559.30]  last week used to be awesome um so do you think this is part of the same kind of
[559.30 --> 566.20]  i don't know what it is discomfort with sort of troubled parts of your history that we encountered
[566.20 --> 571.52]  when they didn't want us to have clippy in the video by the way we we drew a line we drew a line
[571.52 --> 576.00]  we were like there were a couple things that they were not brand safe enough for them and we were
[576.00 --> 580.16]  like yeah we figured we probably weren't going to get away with that we pulled it out but they wanted
[580.16 --> 588.00]  clippy gone we said no clippy stays and we were a hundred percent right like the audience freaking
[588.00 --> 593.34]  loved it so so that was really cool microsoft was actually shockingly easy to work with on that
[593.34 --> 598.18]  like every brand guys you got to understand every brand has their like weird sensitivities and
[598.18 --> 603.92]  of course so we their history and their policies and all that so yeah yeah a hundred percent what was i uh
[603.92 --> 611.66]  i had a i had a long conversation earlier this week with uh bridget and sarah from creator warehouse
[611.66 --> 620.26]  and we were kind of talking about you know what do we envision as the brand for cw because up until now
[620.26 --> 627.16]  cw has mostly been an internal department that creates white label products for lttstore.com and
[627.16 --> 633.02]  for linus tech tips and our various media properties right but in the longer term creator warehouse
[633.02 --> 641.06]  absolutely has the chops to create white label products for someone else or create its own branded
[641.06 --> 646.78]  entities or or whatever right like if we're talking on a long enough time scale five years ten years fifteen
[646.78 --> 653.16]  twenty years right what could that team not do what would you look the cw team in the eye and say no
[653.16 --> 654.08]  you couldn't do that
[654.08 --> 662.56]  they could they could probably get a rocket into space oh well oh okay no i bet you they could
[662.56 --> 664.26]  just not manned
[664.26 --> 668.08]  i bet you an unmanned rocket they could do it
[668.08 --> 676.12]  so okay with that in mind then um it was a it was a really cool uh really open conversation and
[676.12 --> 682.38]  what we were really focused on is sort of what are our core values um you know what are the the key
[682.38 --> 688.22]  pain points we're trying to alleviate for the average consumer and you know what what should our brand
[688.22 --> 695.32]  voice be and one of the conversations that we kind of got into it a little on was around the words geek
[695.32 --> 703.78]  and nerd okay so i'm not going to say who was on which side because that's not important for the
[703.78 --> 709.64]  conversation right now um well yeah like i don't want to i don't want people to be like oh yeah that
[709.64 --> 715.48]  person they have such a stupid perspective on this or whatever because um one of the things that came out
[715.48 --> 724.08]  of that conversation is that while a lot of people are not offended by them or even self-identify as
[724.08 --> 731.26]  a keyboard nerd or a tech geek or whatever the case may be for a lot of people those words are
[731.26 --> 738.58]  a little divisive and so one of the things that i think we kind of settled on at the end of the at
[738.58 --> 744.22]  the end of the conversation although nothing's ever really in stone i think that uh the world changes
[744.22 --> 748.44]  and if we're not willing to change alongside it then we're going to be left behind but one of the
[748.44 --> 757.30]  things that was kind of settled on up until now was hey um that's not going to be part of like our
[757.30 --> 766.08]  our cw corporate branding maybe you could have like a super laser focused sub brand that is like
[766.08 --> 771.18]  you know uh geek wear or you know or something like that like uh and this wasn't even part of the
[771.18 --> 776.52]  conversation but like you know like super street wear looking but like everything's a tech reference
[776.52 --> 783.08]  or something like you mean tech wear not street wear right no i mean like street wear yeah i call
[783.08 --> 787.22]  it like geek wear and it's like styled like street wear but it's like everything's got like
[787.22 --> 792.28]  tech references or something we wouldn't do that like it's a bad idea don't worry um but just like
[792.28 --> 797.90]  that's an example of the kind of thing that you know i think we could be comfortable using a word
[797.90 --> 808.16]  like oh i like that like geek for textiles textiles okay anyway but like spelled to e ch the point is
[808.16 --> 816.96]  that we it's pretty good frank reynolds in chat it's not me it's good though the point is that every
[816.96 --> 823.48]  every brand has their own kind of like sensitivities and one of the things that you know not everyone
[823.48 --> 830.92]  necessarily realized is that those words can be really divisive for people um and sometimes
[830.92 --> 836.98]  i think we uh we i think it's easy to project our own feelings on things so you know for us we're
[836.98 --> 841.56]  sitting here going oh yeah the blue screen of death is like cool but that doesn't change the fact
[841.56 --> 847.38]  that for a lot of people working at microsoft the blue screen of death could be like a really negative
[847.38 --> 852.50]  part of their job you know if that's something that they are dealing with basically constantly
[852.50 --> 861.38]  is partners customers their own internal support agents um just like just constantly talking about
[861.38 --> 865.72]  how much they hate this thing because of the negativity associated with it like it's an emotional
[865.72 --> 871.72]  connection every time you see a blue screen of death something bad happened i'm not saying i agree
[871.72 --> 881.14]  i think that it's also equally an iconic part of microsoft's brand acronyms acronym even the acronym
[881.14 --> 887.22]  is still the same yeah yeah like they're not getting away from anything they just made it boring yeah
[887.22 --> 894.66]  so our our question is how do brands navigate the nostalgia for their rocky past while successfully
[894.66 --> 900.98]  branding for a modern audience embracing failures practically always wins i i think i think the
[900.98 --> 906.18]  smiley face was uh i think the smiley face was a huge win i think there are always this was an
[906.18 --> 911.72]  amazing win i think there are ways that they could make it even even friendlier um like i think if
[911.72 --> 917.72]  you had like you know uh a rotating kind of okay like you know how microsoft has those uh those
[917.72 --> 922.98]  automatically rotating wallpapers uh for your lock screen yep like you can just tell it like i don't
[922.98 --> 927.44]  know you pick a you pick a lock screen you know wallpaper for me or whatever like i think if every blue
[927.44 --> 931.86]  screen looked a little different like that that'd be kind of cool like that'd be a way i'm just saying
[931.86 --> 938.50]  that's a way to modernize it sure i mean i think if you don't agree just no just being friendlier in
[938.50 --> 943.72]  general with it like um what do i have like a section that literally just says what do i do now
[943.72 --> 948.68]  yeah and then it it details like some next steps that you could take something like that
[948.68 --> 955.32]  yeah there's there's a bunch of ways they could make it better just being like oh we're gonna hue shift
[955.32 --> 964.08]  it to black is uh not one of them and you know what doesn't make the trump phone better it not
[964.08 --> 971.60]  actually being made in america the trump organization launched a phone and wireless carrier last week
[971.60 --> 981.10]  with the um somewhat not that credible claim that the phone was made in america
[981.10 --> 989.40]  many people rightly were highly skeptical of this made in america claim and now the website has
[989.40 --> 996.50]  removed any mention of that specific claim and replaced it with other things so here let's go
[996.50 --> 1003.04]  ahead and let's make our way to uh the phone and see if we can find some of the differences here
[1003.04 --> 1010.92]  okay no proudly american they have a period after premium performance but no period after
[1010.92 --> 1019.44]  probably american uh i mean nothing's really how do you narrow down the things that are random and
[1019.44 --> 1028.10]  weird about a page like this you know luke like what here hold on can i zoom why am i not able to
[1028.10 --> 1035.26]  here we go what are these dots yeah i don't know i was wondering if that was i feel like that's got to
[1035.26 --> 1041.02]  be a reference to something i mean i'm not sure what does anyone in chat no i wouldn't i wouldn't
[1041.02 --> 1048.04]  assume that like this i get on the one because no no those are stars are those stars though i mean
[1048.04 --> 1054.10]  they're certainly not aligned in any meaningful way whereas like this seems like it's got the
[1054.10 --> 1059.64]  original 14 states yeah i thought it is that what this is something is there one two three four five six
[1059.64 --> 1064.90]  seven eight nine ten eleven twelve wait hold on 13 14 one two three four five six seven eight nine
[1064.90 --> 1069.78]  ten oh okay okay okay okay original 14 states okay that's something that's something so why are they
[1069.78 --> 1074.10]  in so why is there a period here is this for the original mayflower
[1074.10 --> 1082.12]  i'm just asking i'm just wondering okay so what kind of what kind of wording do we have now
[1082.12 --> 1087.00]  proudly american designed with american values in mind
[1087.00 --> 1098.04]  american proud design that is the biggest load of horse that i think that i have ever seen on a
[1098.04 --> 1104.52]  product page but the 13 state stars all the flags they're in a circle they're not like in a random
[1104.52 --> 1109.68]  scattered arrangement what what is the reference where they're all just like i don't know luke i'm over
[1109.68 --> 1117.56]  it at this point i really don't think it matters that much okay um american proud design what does
[1117.56 --> 1124.78]  that mean american proud design seems like a weird way to arrange that sentence uh what else do we have
[1124.78 --> 1131.28]  okay this is great this is great it gets better out american design it's brought to life right here in
[1131.28 --> 1140.76]  the usa what did what do you mean by brought what does brought to life mean with american hands behind
[1140.76 --> 1150.64]  every device well someone has to deliver it i guess somebody's gonna deliver it i guess we don't have
[1150.64 --> 1157.62]  automated deliveries yet somebody's gotta you know move it once it gets to the port i think oh the the
[1157.62 --> 1163.88]  verge also noted that the specs have now changed that happened fast um the screen is smaller than
[1163.88 --> 1170.20]  before and there is no ram capacity specified our discussion question is how could this happen
[1170.20 --> 1179.98]  i mean that's uh how do you go as far as launching a phone and wireless carrier like you think about the
[1179.98 --> 1187.60]  amount of work that even the most lazy of wireless carrier creators would have had to put into something
[1187.60 --> 1193.20]  like that to launch a wireless carrier i don't know because they're just on somebody else's backbone sure
[1193.20 --> 1201.26]  but you would have had to like have meetings you know how do you manage to do that much work
[1201.26 --> 1207.64]  and not manage to know how big the screen of your flagship product launch phone is yeah
[1207.64 --> 1213.56]  like is it not embarrassing at a certain point apparently not enough
[1213.56 --> 1220.02]  our next discussion question is how would you approach a loved one who has purchased
[1220.02 --> 1226.34]  a t1 phone you know what i'm not going to answer that i'm not going to answer that dan what are
[1226.34 --> 1231.16]  what loved one what are we supposed to be what are we supposed to be doing next well you've still got
[1231.16 --> 1237.02]  time so why not another topic sure let's do let's do another topic you want to pick one do we want to
[1237.02 --> 1241.18]  lift me up you want to pick me up yeah let's do a pick me up steam controller electric steam
[1241.18 --> 1246.34]  controller 2 electric boogaloo do you want to bring up the pictures he's doing something else with
[1246.34 --> 1252.68]  i do tommy b posted a video just over a week ago showcasing their custom steam controller 2 which was
[1252.68 --> 1258.62]  meant to replicate the steam deck's controller layout including the touchpads he built uh he built
[1258.62 --> 1265.32]  several pcbs and even the touchpads themselves he built the touchpads themselves yeah yeah that's pretty
[1265.32 --> 1270.42]  cool that's i didn't actually know that part uh before throwing it into a retro purple transparent
[1270.42 --> 1274.64]  case i've seen that it looks amazing uh walking through the steps he went through to get the
[1274.64 --> 1282.78]  controller working in games look at it how cool is that look at it it's two halves of a steam deck it looks so
[1282.78 --> 1292.96]  sick it actually looks shockingly usable yeah like wow yeah 100 if valve just released this
[1292.96 --> 1300.76]  people would buy the crap out of it yeah probably and like yeah okay okay okay i get it it's square
[1300.76 --> 1305.78]  you guys it's square there there are probably a few things that could be done to make it a little
[1305.78 --> 1310.94]  more ergonomic but but like foundationally to be able to couch game without a huge couch commander
[1310.94 --> 1317.42]  on games that are not traditionally super great for thumbsticks because you have the touchpads people
[1317.42 --> 1321.36]  would love this that's what they really liked about the original uh steam controller you could play games
[1321.36 --> 1327.96]  like save on your couch easier which was awesome um and i know sieve has console ports now but
[1327.96 --> 1336.06]  yeah but still trackpad trackpad better um he added a nice touch of having uh them separate
[1336.06 --> 1342.46]  just like joy cons on a nintendo switch yeah oh that's so cool having individual batteries in the
[1342.46 --> 1348.86]  two sides so you can like game like this if you want you got your track it's it it can be way more
[1348.86 --> 1355.64]  relaxed to be able to put your arms down at your sides and the best part everything is open source
[1355.64 --> 1360.20]  with lots of other guides in case you want to attempt it yourself here's a question uh hold on
[1360.20 --> 1365.62]  quickly uh dan do you mind throwing the link to his video into both the youtube and twitch chats i
[1365.62 --> 1372.58]  threw it in floatplane already here's a question i don't know if there's like a video for us here
[1372.58 --> 1379.28]  that's not really a question but in a situation like this say with the the guy that made the laptop
[1379.28 --> 1383.42]  oh yeah no this guy's on on our radar or this controller oh i don't even necessarily mean in
[1383.42 --> 1390.06]  that way oh like would it be cool if we just made one following the guide um making one following the
[1390.06 --> 1396.36]  guide is is that fair to them is there enough i mean it's open source but yeah but making one
[1396.36 --> 1403.50]  away from their video making one following the guide is super cool but making one by bringing
[1403.50 --> 1410.54]  the creator here and having them show it off and co-host has two additional benefits number one
[1410.54 --> 1415.28]  is we get to highlight a smaller creator yeah because that's the core reason why i would want
[1415.28 --> 1421.82]  to do it and number two is i don't have to build it he already built it what
[1421.82 --> 1427.86]  so you're not you're not going to build one camera you're just going to look at his
[1427.86 --> 1433.66]  literally instead of paying someone on our staff to build one which realistically is what would
[1433.66 --> 1437.46]  probably happen from like a because it's cooking show right like from a video production
[1437.46 --> 1442.24]  standpoint right i'm not saying i would never do a diy project again i'm just saying that
[1442.24 --> 1447.96]  painting my bike almost killed me i'm just i'm just saying that right now i have another project
[1447.96 --> 1453.24]  that if i have if i have two hours to dink around with something i'm doing that also i still have to
[1453.24 --> 1459.54]  upgrade my ally i have the jso like battery upgrade kit with the back panel and like i i got i got my
[1459.54 --> 1469.00]  own project i i do not have a lack of projects sir no lack no lack okay i refuse i refuse to shop at ikea
[1469.00 --> 1476.52]  for that particular for that particular furniture no lack no lack guy okay thank you dan um i was very
[1476.52 --> 1487.12]  enthusiastic it fit the rubric um so yeah so i could either pay someone to build it or i could pay him
[1487.12 --> 1491.64]  to fly up here no that's cool and then we also get to highlight him i think it's way better my thing
[1491.64 --> 1497.80]  i get a conflict in my head because i'm like okay there's an open source project that i want people
[1497.80 --> 1504.28]  to do more and it's making a cool hardware thing that is within our realm obviously we should make
[1504.28 --> 1509.80]  one in order to boost this but then the other confusion comes in with this person is also a
[1509.80 --> 1517.72]  youtuber who has their own video on it so so i don't want to take yeah so it's a it's an interesting
[1517.72 --> 1522.04]  concept but if we fly them up i mean that just yeah that just that just kind of solves everything
[1522.04 --> 1528.44]  yeah um and then you also can in some cases get a little bit of context that wasn't really present in
[1528.44 --> 1533.88]  the original video necessarily yeah um no i mean there's always the like you release a video start
[1533.88 --> 1537.72]  seeing some comments or whatever else and it's like oh yeah okay it would have been cool if i said this or
[1537.72 --> 1544.60]  said that or whatever and i i like collabing i like meeting with new people i uh you know we don't
[1544.60 --> 1551.00]  we haven't always found the most time for it necessarily but when we're able to do it i think
[1551.00 --> 1557.64]  it's i think it's just it's a win-win and there's there's no reason not to so i think uh yeah i think
[1557.64 --> 1563.88]  we'll just we'll we'll just reach out and um you know no guarantees maybe he's yeah it might not be
[1563.88 --> 1568.36]  interesting or maybe it doesn't work for our schedule or maybe we realize you know after chatting that you
[1568.36 --> 1572.44]  know what his video said everything that needed to be said about it so there's not really a whole lot more
[1572.44 --> 1581.24]  meat on this chicken um so i'm not i'm not promising it'll work out but uh hey it doesn't
[1581.24 --> 1586.92]  it doesn't hurt to start a conversation the worst thing that can happen is we meet someone new yeah
[1588.92 --> 1593.08]  yeah and we collab and then they hate us forever you know yeah
[1595.32 --> 1596.60]  i mean that only happened once
[1596.60 --> 1601.64]  uh
[1601.64 --> 1602.28]  uh
[1602.28 --> 1604.84]  new topic or what yes
[1605.96 --> 1611.24]  uh sure you have 13 minutes left we can talk about another one riot games esports sponsored by
[1611.96 --> 1617.40]  sports betting i thought you were picking pick me up topics is there any more in the doc
[1617.40 --> 1621.88]  i think so you get like one a month yeah the rtx
[1621.88 --> 1627.16]  50 50 50 is coming out that's a that's a pick me up well it's a pick up for
[1630.92 --> 1631.16]  the
[1634.20 --> 1635.08]  take your time
[1635.08 --> 1648.36]  this last tuesday nvidia announced that the rtx 50 50 starting uh video announced the rtx 50 50
[1648.36 --> 1652.76]  starting at 240 i'm struggling today uh their announcement includes lots of charts flexing
[1652.76 --> 1658.44]  gains with dlss because of course it does and frame gen but no direct comparisons with those
[1658.44 --> 1668.12]  technologies turned off so here's the question yes has nvidia learned nothing i think they learned a lot
[1668.12 --> 1673.96]  actually i think they learned that marketing with dlss and frame gen on works yeah i think they learned a
[1673.96 --> 1679.88]  ton i think the community taught them very well very effectively
[1679.88 --> 1690.36]  yeah for sure uh it includes uh 2560 kuda course the same number that was included in the rtx 3050
[1690.92 --> 1701.08]  let's go it also uses the same gddr6 that the rtx 3050 had uh nvidia apparently chose this to be more
[1701.08 --> 1706.28]  power efficient but at 130 watts it will still require an external power connector
[1706.28 --> 1713.16]  uh that's weird i hosted tech linked today and there was a bit of a conflicting story there oh
[1713.16 --> 1721.72]  um i i the it uses gddr7 in the mobile variant which was apparently chosen for its better efficiency
[1721.72 --> 1726.92]  and uses gddr6 on the desktop variant because i guess who cares about efficiency you're running a
[1726.92 --> 1734.20]  desktop was the was the version of things that i heard oh so basically
[1734.20 --> 1743.00]  man how can we oh man wait it oh man i was i was uh what i i missed this part when you were reading
[1743.00 --> 1748.36]  through the thing it actually has the same number of kuda cores as the 3050 says so in the doc that is
[1748.36 --> 1757.56]  actually embarrassing yeah so it's like a juiced 3050 but with like more ai yeah
[1757.56 --> 1770.36]  how am i supposed to be excited about this luke uh you're not let's go okay our discussion question
[1770.36 --> 1779.08]  is 3050 is what gpu would you buy for 250 dollars so here let's let's head over to i don't even know i
[1779.08 --> 1784.20]  you know i always default to new egg because i'm not actually american so i don't actually shop at
[1784.20 --> 1791.16]  american stores and new egg was just kind of the go-to for so many years but where do you guys
[1791.16 --> 1797.96]  actually shop now because new egg seems to kind of kind of suck now i'm a little scared i was just
[1797.96 --> 1802.84]  gonna say amazon oh the first answer was amazon okay there it is and the second answer was amazon
[1802.84 --> 1808.52]  new egg best buy amazon microcenter pc part picker is not a store ebay apple apple okay you guys are just
[1808.52 --> 1813.72]  trolling the microcenter people came in strong but they they also came in late the the apple responders
[1813.72 --> 1820.76]  are faster which is concerning oh it's probably that apple should benchmark our fans
[1824.04 --> 1829.72]  do human benchmark but for people that are fans of different things and just see who the better
[1829.72 --> 1834.92]  fan bases are this is not dingable what are you even what are you doing right now of nvidia fans
[1834.92 --> 1842.68]  versus amd fans versus intel fans and see who the best fans are what about the ai o fans no stop okay
[1842.68 --> 1846.44]  that's a thing that's a thing that's what that's the that's a joke i thought you were making i don't
[1846.44 --> 1851.64]  get to ding myself no no you have that is a privilege for linus and you no you have to ding it all right
[1851.64 --> 1859.24]  i get the sanding oh you just muted it and then dinged it yeah that's rude that was awful that was so deep
[1859.24 --> 1866.04]  that was rude to the audience there you go there you go good job using the dumb so what would i buy
[1866.04 --> 1874.84]  for 250 bucks i mean realistically the arc b580 is the only reasonable choice it's not 250 unfortunately
[1874.84 --> 1880.92]  but it is 250 msrp which means realistically the 50 50 is probably going to come in at around a similar
[1880.92 --> 1888.12]  price this thing is just such a winner as long as you have a pci express gen 4 motherboard so you're not
[1888.12 --> 1894.20]  stuck at eight lanes at gen 3 speed and we i mean it's been a hot minute but we did do videos on how
[1894.20 --> 1901.80]  to make a little bit more cash you can legitimately go mow some lawns you are not seriously referring to
[1901.80 --> 1908.52]  the blueberry selling video are you no the we did too it was part of the same series yeah uh linus summer
[1908.52 --> 1913.80]  job is that what did we is that what we called it oh my god yeah there they are by laptop there they are
[1913.80 --> 1922.12]  we did summer job mowing lawns can you earn a laptop summer job selling berries laptop or bust episode
[1922.12 --> 1932.12]  two man 800 000 views the mowing lawns one did okay it actually did kind of okay i mean for something
[1932.12 --> 1940.52]  eight years ago it has not idea was this that was me i think oh i like it dude we had little branded
[1940.52 --> 1949.32]  shirts i know i know i wish i still had my shirts from this series mo grass mo problems it was so good
[1951.00 --> 1959.08]  it was so good why is this the most replayed part okay because we're coming back oh people are skipping
[1959.08 --> 1966.20]  the sponsor spot i think yeah okay but what happened here is this the yard that they finally agreed to let
[1966.20 --> 1974.36]  me what okay what was that thumbnail i don't know dude what a weird video going door to door man it
[1974.36 --> 1980.04]  that part sucked that part is terrible hopefully you know some people in your neighborhood that'll
[1980.04 --> 1988.04]  make it a little less weird oh dude door-to-door sales is an amazing way what is that where did that come
[1988.04 --> 1993.40]  to acclimate to rejection oh no uh it was what someone at the door said i can't come to the door i'm naked
[1993.40 --> 2002.04]  got it got it wild i also found like like i legitimately did this when i was a kid i find it's a lot less awkward
[2004.20 --> 2008.52]  i don't know why what door-to-door sales when if you're trying to like door-to-door sales like can i mow your lawn
[2008.52 --> 2017.16]  and you're like 12 oh oh yeah oh dude it's so easy dude not only yeah people like want to do it being a little girl is like op
[2017.16 --> 2026.92]  okay my my daughters my daughters got like fundraiser chocolate bars okay they got fundraiser chocolate bars
[2028.20 --> 2029.64]  okay when i was a kid
[2032.92 --> 2039.32]  sorry keep going when i was a kid okay whenever i got like fundraiser stuff dude i i could have walked for
[2039.32 --> 2049.40]  miles and like struggled to sell like you know bars or whatever right dude we walked like one block
[2049.40 --> 2055.24]  and they blew through like 30 chocolate bars like every house bought like two or three i have like this
[2055.24 --> 2063.00]  is ridiculous i i all you have to do to kill it as a door-to-door salesman is be a little girl
[2063.00 --> 2066.12]  yeah
[2068.44 --> 2069.96]  and they have ways these days
[2072.04 --> 2072.36]  uh
[2072.36 --> 2074.36]  uh
[2074.36 --> 2074.52]  uh
[2076.28 --> 2081.88]  wow i had a thing that i was gonna say i really did oh right i keep changing my car
[2082.52 --> 2087.88]  because i have a rule that if there's like the same car you've always had yeah oh keep changing your car
[2087.88 --> 2094.12]  uh i have a rule that if i drive past a lemonade stand i have to like stop that's pretty cool usually
[2094.12 --> 2099.16]  i did you get lemonade when we saw that place yeah nice i was thinking about it and then i was lazy
[2099.16 --> 2106.76]  yeah i i like have to fairly recently i was driving around with emma and we saw a lemonade stand and
[2106.76 --> 2112.84]  we were not in my car we were in her car and there was no change and no cash there was no way to
[2112.84 --> 2118.28]  like buy the lemonade and it like actually genuinely ruined my day i'm not even kidding
[2118.28 --> 2125.00]  because i remember sitting on the corner with rich my brother trying to sell lemonade when we were like
[2125.00 --> 2130.20]  10 because we were trying to save up for a snes and i remember people driving by and thinking like
[2130.20 --> 2134.92]  man and then there was i think i've even told you this story there was one dude and i think it was
[2134.92 --> 2141.00]  like a jeep or something with his girlfriend and he stopped by and was just like super cool
[2141.00 --> 2146.20]  just like sup guys like he's telling yeah and he gave us like way more money than made sense for the
[2146.20 --> 2150.52]  lemonade we gave him extra lemonade and he was just like see ya and took off and i was like i want to be
[2150.52 --> 2156.76]  that guy that's pretty cool that's who i want to be that's what i have i have paid his coolness forward
[2156.76 --> 2160.92]  and will ideally do so forever i like it i like it i respect it yeah
[2165.16 --> 2168.36]  so we're talking what we're talking about overpriced graphics cards um yes
[2168.36 --> 2177.88]  yes dan what's next help us out here because we're yeah please save us we've drifted thank you
[2177.88 --> 2184.12]  okay do the other thing if you can even explain properly oh merch messages stop talking to me
[2184.92 --> 2194.28]  merch messages boys it's a good week to send a merch message three years here we go
[2194.28 --> 2202.68]  oh it's finally ready three years and countless revisions later
[2205.48 --> 2210.20]  it's finally here i want one so let's watch the video we're gonna watch the video are you ready for
[2210.20 --> 2214.92]  the video i'm ready for the video i'm ready to relive my old memories with a oh wait what just happened
[2214.92 --> 2219.72]  three more years to make it transparent no no start over i missed the beginning okay okay
[2219.72 --> 2226.12]  transparent this screwdriver took three years to develop and it took three more years to make it
[2226.12 --> 2234.20]  transparent cool so good we always knew we wanted to transfer so we started working on it at the same
[2234.20 --> 2240.44]  time as the original but one problem the plastic we used for the original cannot be clear so we had to
[2240.44 --> 2246.20]  find a new plastic to make the transparent screwdriver with and we did fortunately it was around the same
[2246.20 --> 2251.08]  time we were having ratchet issues after switching manufacturers it helped us peer inside the
[2251.08 --> 2257.16]  mechanism and diagnosed the root cause of the issues we were having but it was brittle as
[2258.36 --> 2263.56]  so it was back to the drawing board and this is where we stumbled on triton a plastic used by some of
[2263.56 --> 2269.08]  the world's most popular water bottles and while more durable it does present its own set of challenges
[2269.08 --> 2273.88]  it would harden the mold way faster than we would like and this leads to massive imperfections in the
[2273.88 --> 2279.08]  plastic this also meant that part ejection was a flippin nightmare parts would not come off of our
[2279.08 --> 2284.44]  molds without cracking damaging or flying off into freaking outer space and because of the difference
[2284.44 --> 2289.24]  in thickness between the top and bottom of our handle any handle made with this plastic would have weld
[2289.24 --> 2295.96]  lines all over it not only did we have to make the plastic flow faster into the mold by expanding the
[2295.96 --> 2302.60]  entry points we had to change the end cap mold and make the flow more even from top to bottom of the
[2302.60 --> 2308.20]  handle we didn't want to just make new molds that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars but with a
[2308.20 --> 2313.96]  little bit of solidworks and a few modifications to our molds we could do it for a lot less all we
[2313.96 --> 2319.24]  have to do is replace these parts and we're ready to make a transparent screwdriver it may be clear now
[2319.80 --> 2327.00]  but getting here was anything but and i'm excited to finally get this into your hands lttstore.com
[2327.00 --> 2337.40]  hell yeah that was cool yeah they did a great job of that and everything kyle said was right man there
[2337.40 --> 2345.48]  were multiple times when we thought you know what forget it this just isn't worth it like how can it be
[2345.48 --> 2352.28]  how can it be this much bloody work just to you know fire a different plastic into a stupid
[2352.28 --> 2358.92]  hunk of metal thing to make the bloody shape and if we weren't so obsessive about things like those
[2358.92 --> 2366.04]  weld lines we could have been done ages ago they didn't actually impact the the structural rigidity
[2366.04 --> 2371.96]  of the of the screwdriver or anything like that didn't look well what they looked like what they
[2371.96 --> 2378.12]  looked like was a scratch an imperfection yeah or a crack yeah and if anybody got this thing and it
[2378.12 --> 2382.92]  had a crack in it they'd be like i already have a butt i don't need more things with cracks in them
[2386.12 --> 2391.96]  no that's not don't even don't even it's not worth it it's not worth it that does not get dinged um
[2391.96 --> 2395.64]  question there's been a few of these questions in float plane chat for sure hit me so we figured out
[2395.64 --> 2405.88]  the material triton it's clear fantastic i love it i want one purple um clear purple there's no point
[2405.88 --> 2411.88]  hiding the fact that obviously we thought of that yeah right like obviously you kind of have to
[2411.88 --> 2419.64]  there's i mean look we had come up with the with the snes the retro excuse me the retro driver as
[2419.64 --> 2425.16]  well as the noctua editions before anyone ever suggested them publicly yeah yeah yeah and those
[2425.16 --> 2430.68]  were not the only things that we came up with in our in our brainstorming sessions and one of the ones
[2430.68 --> 2437.64]  that we obviously thought of was throwback n64 clear transparent plastic colors yeah i think they
[2437.64 --> 2444.52]  call it atomic purple you can call it legally distinct like nuclear purple so so look i'm not
[2444.52 --> 2451.24]  going to deny that we've thought of it and now that we have a clear plastic base i'm not going to deny
[2451.24 --> 2457.00]  that the chances that such a thing could exist are higher than they were before we had a working clear
[2457.00 --> 2462.28]  plastic this would have to sell decently well however well okay that but i wasn't even i hadn't
[2462.28 --> 2468.20]  even gotten there yet so this has to be a commercial success before you see any more clear colors and
[2468.20 --> 2474.68]  number two is that once you add the dye you can change the flow characteristics again
[2477.48 --> 2486.36]  yeah okay so if everything goes great and we don't have to do three years of
[2486.36 --> 2493.32]  mold tuning again then obviously we'd love to do it but that's not a guarantee right now yeah yeah
[2493.32 --> 2499.24]  right now the product we have for sale is the transparent screwdriver uh should we do a little
[2499.24 --> 2504.84]  unboxing do you want to do an unboxing yeah here you go your very own screwdriver yeah go for it oh it's
[2504.84 --> 2510.04]  mine i mean it is now taking it home uh you could i mean you could try holding it up into the frame so
[2510.04 --> 2517.80]  people can at least see it oh good lord uh cute box design right yeah shout out sarah and her team
[2518.84 --> 2525.08]  actually i think our our packaging game is like so much better than it was back in the back in the day
[2525.96 --> 2533.00]  well there we go you get the ltd card yeah heck yeah it shows off our bit sets yep what's the qr code
[2533.00 --> 2539.24]  for i don't know ah leave a review cool that makes sense heck yeah you get your bit load out is it like
[2540.60 --> 2545.80]  oh it's a gradient i see i was like okay yes and you can actually like see through it too which is
[2545.80 --> 2552.76]  pretty cool there's not like i mean the box is cool and stuff but it's it's it's sort of right there yeah
[2552.76 --> 2559.56]  i mean look personally i've always been pretty minimalist when it comes to packaging yeah i don't like
[2559.56 --> 2564.92]  spending a ton of money on something that people are going to immediately throw away um but the
[2564.92 --> 2569.56]  team is always kind of pushing back on me for you know hey presentation matters and i think we've
[2569.56 --> 2575.88]  found a good middle ground there's no waste in there all of that is recyclable yeah and i think it looks
[2575.88 --> 2581.96]  great i think they do a really great job of the presentation of the product um when you open the box
[2581.96 --> 2586.76]  absolutely i do like that it's like very like if i put it all back in here
[2588.20 --> 2593.16]  it's it's just right there it's just right there no they do a really great job anyway it's available
[2593.16 --> 2599.08]  now at lmg.gg transparent screwdriver i know i mentioned this i think last week or whenever the
[2599.08 --> 2603.80]  last time we looked at it was but being able to look like that at the bits that are inside is
[2603.80 --> 2610.44]  actually awesome hold on luke cam i like it so that i know if there's any missing exactly i mean for
[2610.44 --> 2614.20]  sony reasons super useful you can know whether to be triggered or not this had another set in it we
[2614.20 --> 2617.72]  have a bunch of different bit sets you might have more than just one that fits in the screwdriver
[2617.72 --> 2621.64]  being able to check oh is that one that i'm looking for in here is kind of nice without popping
[2621.64 --> 2626.44]  it out every time even though that's kind of fun on its own right yeah no they uh they absolutely
[2626.44 --> 2631.08]  killed it on this thing i'm i'm so excited to finally bring this to market because we've had like
[2631.08 --> 2637.96]  kyle said we've had transparent screwdrivers since before we launched the original screwdriver
[2637.96 --> 2642.20]  but they were just made of a plastic that was so brittle that we couldn't launch it
[2642.84 --> 2647.48]  and uh like he said that it was with the transparent selector rings that we were actually able to
[2647.48 --> 2651.48]  diagnose the issues we had with the ratchets that were delaying the launch of the solid color
[2651.48 --> 2658.84]  screwdriver so transparent was beneficial to us both in terms of the coolness factor and in terms of the
[2658.84 --> 2665.72]  legitimate aid that it gave us in our product development it is can we get close enough that people can see that
[2665.72 --> 2673.24]  uh i don't know you'd have to be like it's a good question indeed actually here you know what yes
[2673.24 --> 2677.24]  we can but i'll have to get up and you'll have to talk through it no no dan you're i don't need focus
[2677.96 --> 2680.36]  focus oh lordy oh here
[2684.52 --> 2687.32]  okay so uh it's pretty dark
[2687.32 --> 2696.04]  so are you showing it changing with the selector switch or whatever oh yeah you can't really see
[2696.04 --> 2701.00]  it super well in person you can see it very clearly but like when you rotate it back and
[2701.00 --> 2705.48]  forth to either make it so that it's twist right or twist left or neutral where it's fixed and it's not
[2705.48 --> 2711.56]  really ratcheting anymore you can see the selector switch change for that again due to our lighting and
[2711.56 --> 2716.20]  the camera setup you can't really i mean you've got like the blank white bit showing right now no no
[2716.20 --> 2721.40]  that's not blank that's the little uh that's the little spring-loaded dude that gives it the feel
[2721.40 --> 2727.48]  okay so yeah he's showing uh the the the like haptic feedback of changing the switch right there there's
[2727.48 --> 2733.48]  a little metal uh spring-loaded thing that you can feel now this is the part you really can't see that
[2733.48 --> 2740.12]  well uh but that's the rocker so when you change it to twist left or turn or twist right or the neutral
[2740.12 --> 2745.24]  position you can see it turning there we go yeah yeah so you can see like a paddle in there kind of
[2745.24 --> 2751.48]  flipping to either side and then there's also on the function the function that one serves um is
[2751.48 --> 2757.56]  that's the reverse mechanism so one of the things that we modified in our ratchet one of the things
[2757.56 --> 2764.44]  that ltt screwdriver haters love to say is that it's just a mega pro screwdriver yeah it's not their
[2764.44 --> 2771.80]  ratchet goes the other way and part of what we did was keeping the profile of it the same so that it
[2771.80 --> 2780.12]  still fits in this uh tiny space but it has that reverse mechanism so that our ratchet goes the direct
[2780.12 --> 2787.40]  so when you turn the screw this way you flip the ratchet the same way instead of it being opposite um
[2788.44 --> 2792.68]  all while staying slim that was one of the things we did and then also the like the tactile feedback on
[2792.68 --> 2796.84]  the this little spring loaded dude at the back that was really hard to fine tune and then you
[2796.84 --> 2800.60]  were going to say when you keep rotating sorry yeah there's one more thing you guys couldn't see which
[2800.60 --> 2806.20]  is as you're actually ratcheting you can see the little the thing that is making the click you can
[2806.20 --> 2811.40]  see it flap yes you can as it uh as it goes through the teeth yeah which is actually like pretty cool
[2811.40 --> 2814.84]  here hold on let's uh let's try it let's try and get that that's worth capturing it's hard to
[2814.84 --> 2823.96]  it's hard to see but it is genuinely pretty cool i think that's sweet i love i just really like being
[2823.96 --> 2827.72]  able to see because when it mentioned like it helped them diagnose the mechanism i was like what
[2828.36 --> 2831.64]  oh there we go oh yeah oh yeah yeah that works
[2834.60 --> 2834.84]  yeah
[2839.00 --> 2841.64]  and then i think if you go the other way it's the one on the other side right
[2841.64 --> 2846.28]  you'd have to change the direction but i think it's the one on the other side
[2850.76 --> 2853.16]  i think it's all the way over on the other side of the white piece
[2856.28 --> 2857.72]  oh oh oh oh
[2863.16 --> 2865.96]  not there yeah there we go
[2865.96 --> 2871.88]  yeah you can see it moving there you go there you go there you go it's a little hard to capture
[2871.88 --> 2877.24]  on camera but it is extremely obvious and he's the same person this is a consistent issue
[2880.44 --> 2888.20]  but yeah it looks it looks awesome very cool that's wicked someone asked if the if it feels the same
[2888.20 --> 2893.88]  yeah um it does i think it feels the same to me or at least very similar as the same it has the
[2893.88 --> 2898.68]  profile is the same it comes out of the same mold we made modifications to the mold they're saying does
[2898.68 --> 2907.16]  the plastic result in a different hand feel no because the plastic um the plastic hand feel is from the edm
[2907.16 --> 2913.72]  texturing technique that we do on the inside of the mold so that roughness is intentional
[2913.72 --> 2923.48]  and and the the slight sort of blasted look and feel of it okay it's very intentional it could be
[2923.48 --> 2930.20]  completely glassy glassy clear smooth if our mold was completely smooth but we found that this level
[2930.20 --> 2935.72]  of roughness and and and texture was a little bit nicer for grip on the hand grip yeah yeah not a ton
[2935.72 --> 2939.88]  of grip it's not the grippiest screwdriver in the world i'm not going to pretend that it is but it adds
[2939.88 --> 2946.36]  a just a little bit of a little bit a little bit to it it will probably you know what i'm not going
[2946.36 --> 2950.12]  to guarantee what will happen over time but what i have seen is the solid color ones have tended to
[2950.12 --> 2955.40]  smooth out with after extreme oh so you think that might also happen i don't know i'm not i don't know
[2955.40 --> 2962.28]  i will say nothing i will say nothing no guarantee glad you guys like it it seems like people are uh
[2962.28 --> 2971.08]  seems like people are super super into it uh but that's not all we also have the transparent
[2971.80 --> 2977.24]  collection oh my okay these are actually pretty cool do you want to read out the thing while i
[2977.24 --> 2981.72]  while i put them on uh sure also before a question before i start reading that is there going to be a
[2981.72 --> 2990.44]  transparent stubby uh well if the full size which is our best-selling screwdriver if the full size is a
[2990.44 --> 2997.56]  huge success then who knows there could be a stubby it could happen i would i would never say that for
[2997.56 --> 3003.16]  certain it would not happen but we do have to evaluate our products based on their potential
[3003.16 --> 3008.76]  for commercial success and the transparent screwdriver will be the the major indicator
[3008.76 --> 3014.44]  for whether or not we will see other colors of transparent assuming that technically it is feasible
[3014.44 --> 3020.04]  and whether or not we will see other designs in transparent yeah uh the rest of the blurb we have
[3020.04 --> 3027.16]  two brand new print order designs inspired by the theme of transparency the x-ray vision officer zip
[3027.16 --> 3032.92]  up hoodie which is not the first one he's starting with so i will switch what i'm saying and the core
[3032.92 --> 3040.20]  no no no no yes i'll start with that one uh featuring the x-ray vision officer zip-up hoodie uh featuring an
[3040.20 --> 3045.56]  x-ray of your favorite chief vision officer and his or at least his teeth it's you
[3045.56 --> 3053.48]  who taken directly from where we got his wisdom teeth pulled improved with three thousand five
[3053.48 --> 3059.88]  hundred dollars worth of headgear i saw it on set before we got here i didn't realize it was your head
[3061.80 --> 3067.08]  you can see um uh hold on yeah what is the three thousand five hundred dollars to the head is that a
[3067.08 --> 3075.48]  vr headset it's an apple vision pro oh that's funny so we ct scanned the apple vision pro i should
[3075.48 --> 3081.88]  have seen the earrings i see it now there's the earrings right here oh man i get it now and then
[3081.88 --> 3090.04]  those are my actual like dental scans it's funny because i had the idea when i was company is so weird
[3090.04 --> 3096.36]  i had the idea when i was chatting with lisa who wanted to do like like this kind of like cool
[3097.00 --> 3103.96]  we got the ct scanner we were like oh we should do something with like clear something right and so
[3103.96 --> 3111.24]  she had the idea of doing like you know it's like a like a kind of cool skull tech something design and
[3111.24 --> 3116.04]  uh and it was like at the last minute i think we'd already kind of like approved it and i was like yo lisa
[3116.04 --> 3123.40]  a super weird but like if you guys called like my dentist do you think they'd just like give you my
[3123.40 --> 3127.88]  x-ray scans and then and then could you like put that into the because obviously that's not
[3127.88 --> 3133.96]  like my my skull head case or you know whatever right so it's like it's a it's a skull image but
[3133.96 --> 3140.76]  the dental records and the the bits that are me are inserted into it so those are my teeth oh that's
[3140.76 --> 3147.16]  funny which is flipping well i can't believe my dentist wait it's not your head case no like
[3147.72 --> 3152.76]  like we don't we don't have a clean scan of like my the top of my skull because they don't take
[3152.76 --> 3157.88]  pictures of that when you go to the dentist earrings show up in the dentist they do oh yeah because it's
[3157.88 --> 3162.44]  it's like this area here but they don't have like up here there'd be no reason for them to blast my
[3162.44 --> 3170.12]  brain yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um narcissist button for what for uh i don't know it doesn't
[3170.12 --> 3178.68]  doesn't matter i don't know um anyway there's but wait there's more we also have uh and the core
[3178.68 --> 3187.24]  memory t-shirt featuring a different angle of that x-ray and upgraded with more cool oh okay don't mind
[3187.24 --> 3193.16]  that the print quality is kind of faded on this it'll be like this one uh but this is just like
[3193.16 --> 3197.72]  this is a test one these are print to order so they'll ship in a little while um but yeah here if
[3197.72 --> 3204.44]  we can get a if we can get a closer look at this one you can actually see you can see the earrings
[3204.44 --> 3216.68]  and then yep that's my teeth that's my toothies upgraded with amd inside of course yeah so yeah cool right
[3217.64 --> 3225.16]  i like it yeah i thought uh i thought lisa did a great job with these all right what else we got
[3225.16 --> 3232.04]  here anyway all available now at lmg.gg transparent collection uh what are we uh
[3233.32 --> 3238.12]  complicated yeah i think i'll probably leave that alone for now all right what uh what are we supposed
[3238.12 --> 3243.72]  to do now dan oh wait we're supposed to explain merch messages yeah yeah yeah if you want to if you
[3243.72 --> 3249.00]  want to interact with the show all you got to do is hey maybe by picking up a cool transparent
[3249.00 --> 3254.84]  screwdriver pretty cool or one of the transparent collection hoodies or t-shirts um just go to
[3254.84 --> 3260.76]  ltdstore.com add something to your cart and you'll see a little box for a merch message we think merch
[3260.76 --> 3268.12]  messages are the best flipping way to interact with the show because unlike a twitch boot or a super chat or
[3268.12 --> 3275.16]  or whatever um you can throw money at your screen with a merch message and even if we don't get to
[3275.16 --> 3281.16]  your message hey you'll get high quality merchandise in return a kick chair a kick chair a kick kick
[3281.16 --> 3288.84]  kick kick kick kick and uh sorry what are we talking about anyway the point is that sorry that's a bit
[3288.84 --> 3295.24]  of a reference to the pre-show or wait i don't even think that was on the pre-show that was just our
[3295.24 --> 3303.88]  conversation that we had privately anyway the point is leave a merch message in the cart and it will go to
[3303.88 --> 3312.36]  producer dan who will oh my god no no one's helping you who will reply to your message or will forward
[3312.36 --> 3318.84]  it to someone internally who can help you or might even curate it for me and luke to respond to on the
[3318.84 --> 3327.64]  show somebody linked me this we have a video of it how cool is that it's like someone did cool stuff so
[3327.64 --> 3334.52]  that's the ratchet reverse yeah i'm sure there's also a video on there of the uh the flappy panel
[3334.52 --> 3339.96]  dan do you want to show them how a merch message works yeah sure i've got lots here it's been live
[3339.96 --> 3345.56]  for about an hour and we've already got about 300 so i've been doing one every 10 seconds so far uh hey
[3345.56 --> 3351.00]  dll excited about the new transparent screwdriver my original all black driver is still kicking and about
[3351.00 --> 3357.00]  to have a brother question for luke what experience do you have in the dfir
[3357.64 --> 3366.36]  dfir i don't know what that is a digital forensics and incidents response what experience do i have
[3367.24 --> 3371.72]  in digital forensics based on that he wasn't familiar with the term i'm gonna say
[3373.32 --> 3376.76]  not that much cyber security things oh well
[3376.76 --> 3390.12]  uh i mean officially not a lot wink howdy dll this will be the sixth screwdriver i've gotten after
[3390.12 --> 3394.36]  your support team sent me a new one i was wondering is there anything that you have bought multiple
[3394.36 --> 3402.60]  times just because you like it oh yeah almost certainly oh man what am i there's there's gotta be
[3402.60 --> 3415.64]  uh cereal cereal i put not consumables um i just because i like it okay that's the tough part
[3416.52 --> 3422.28]  just because i like it not because i could use a second one but just because i like it
[3422.28 --> 3427.72]  i think i have an example okay hit me these shorts
[3432.68 --> 3438.84]  they're like way too expensive my whole thing is that i don't spend money these particular ones are
[3440.84 --> 3447.32]  i think 10 years old at this point and i wear literally these particular ones like at least once
[3447.32 --> 3455.48]  a week and they still look totally fine they are just tanks okay does this count um i owned a copy
[3455.48 --> 3461.80]  of final fantasy 6 when i was a kid as an adult with i don't even know if i have a working super nintendo
[3461.80 --> 3469.48]  at home i bought a cartridge but is that that's is that is that more of a collectible that's a collectible
[3469.48 --> 3474.12]  that's a collectible because i have no intention of actually plugging it into another one because you liked it
[3474.12 --> 3482.28]  i did i don't know if that counts man i'm trying to think i bought another one just because i like it
[3482.28 --> 3488.52]  yeah the tall boy shirt like i buy multiple that's i consider clothing almost a consumable but i've bought
[3488.52 --> 3496.76]  like seven of the exact same one okay tell me this npc i bought five pairs of yonex's uh 65 w
[3496.76 --> 3506.04]  x2 shoes but it's because i'm gonna go through them and depending on their product refresh cycle
[3506.04 --> 3512.60]  sometimes they don't have a wide fit so i just stocked up on them does that count as buying more because i like them
[3512.60 --> 3516.68]  i think the problem with my shorts your shoes my shoes
[3518.52 --> 3524.76]  we're treating a thing that isn't generally seen as a consumable as a consumable we like it so much that we're oh badminton shoes are very consumable
[3524.76 --> 3530.36]  consumable because of the strain from all the lunging like dude oh yeah that makes sense i should show you
[3530.36 --> 3535.88]  what the insides of my badminton shoes look like they get scuffed like on the inside the bottoms are
[3535.88 --> 3540.68]  fine because you're playing on like a rubber course is there an example of something that wouldn't wear out
[3542.20 --> 3550.84]  that i bought another one just because i like it man it doesn't wear out it's not consumed yeah like i'd buy
[3550.84 --> 3555.88]  one of something just because i like it you know what i own more xbox controllers than i need
[3556.44 --> 3563.64]  just because i like them like i bought that for that's acceptable not always so i bought that one
[3563.64 --> 3570.36]  the project scarlet one that was given out to the developers of of the i believe the xbox series x on
[3570.36 --> 3575.80]  topic you have a transparent one that looks sick i do i saw it at your place the other day i do it looks
[3575.80 --> 3580.76]  awesome it's pretty cool i kind of like immediately wanted one because i don't know what transparency
[3580.76 --> 3585.56]  is cool but it's uh yeah i don't know i don't that might be on the collection side of things with
[3585.56 --> 3590.20]  all this stick drift people are saying xbox controllers are kind of consumable
[3591.88 --> 3598.52]  oh yeah i'm not oh i can't even tell you you're wrong brother i can't even tell you you're wrong no
[3598.52 --> 3607.88]  oh lordy just because i like it i feel like we're putting too many caveats on it
[3609.32 --> 3615.24]  hmm well their example was the screwdriver which has a utility to it but is not something that you
[3615.24 --> 3621.56]  would expect to like die yeah there's probably there's probably tools that i own more than one
[3621.56 --> 3625.08]  of but i wouldn't say that it's ever happened just because i like it but if you're going to get more
[3625.08 --> 3628.28]  than one of these you would probably get different versions and at that point are you collecting
[3629.16 --> 3634.04]  i think so i okay in that case i think my xbox controller counts yeah because this could
[3634.04 --> 3638.84]  conceivably wear out that was the direction i was going in it could be collectible like an xbox
[3638.84 --> 3643.48]  controller would but realistically you can only game with one controller at a time you can only screw
[3643.48 --> 3650.12]  with one screwdriver at a time well you know unless you're in inside out inside out compression
[3651.00 --> 3658.04]  yeah um middle middle middle out middle out that's right that's right um i'm gonna go with i'm
[3658.04 --> 3662.76]  gonna go with xbox controllers it's really stupid and i actually don't care that much but i have a
[3662.76 --> 3668.36]  bit of a weak spot for cool game controllers xbox controllers i also i also have a that cool um
[3668.36 --> 3673.24]  spider-man ps5 controller i like the gears of war xbox controllers i've always liked those yep
[3674.68 --> 3681.48]  i'm not even that into gears of war but i really like the controllers german says children yeah i i did like
[3681.48 --> 3686.84]  i did like my children so i got another one yeah that happened yeah i don't buy them though i don't
[3686.84 --> 3692.04]  buy them i just there's other ways he rents it's vancouver we'll explain it to you we'll explain it to
[3692.04 --> 3698.28]  you when you're older i might it might be a little warm for me to wear a hoodie right now let's throw
[3698.28 --> 3704.36]  another one in here just because we have sure a couple dear dynas duke and lan i work in the defense
[3704.36 --> 3710.20]  industry working as a senior engineer trying to push teams to embrace new tech what are your experiences you've had
[3710.20 --> 3717.56]  to trying to modernize how people work looks i knew i i knew luke would have this reaction
[3720.36 --> 3727.32]  you want to take this one yeah i'm gonna take it off a long walk off a short fear
[3729.64 --> 3737.24]  do you have any thoughts stan i haven't thought how much how is it trying to most of my brain is just whiskey
[3737.24 --> 3745.64]  so dan has been trying to pick the wrong month to stop huffing glue at at linus media group
[3745.64 --> 3755.24]  incorporated we use office 365 google workspace slack uh trello monday.com asana reich
[3756.44 --> 3764.92]  miro uh jot form google forms google calendar google drive powerpoint one drive
[3764.92 --> 3774.76]  uh raw word documents uh some people use uh what's that thing called there's obsidian and then
[3774.76 --> 3781.40]  there's also the other one and i don't remember the name of and people use both of them uh notepad
[3781.96 --> 3787.80]  uh any anything you could possibly notion there we go thank you uh people you use anything you could
[3787.80 --> 3794.92]  possibly imagine that has a trello or a uh text input kanban board on it and anything you could
[3794.92 --> 3799.16]  possibly imagine that has a text input and anything you could possibly imagine that has a calendar in my
[3799.16 --> 3806.84]  meeting with sarah who i am going to call out here pretty hard uh-oh in my meeting with sarah she was
[3806.84 --> 3817.88]  taking meeting notes in illustrator that is so based luke let's put that on our sop that's kind of sick
[3817.88 --> 3828.84]  it's vector based lossless notes she'll never lose them uh so dan uh through through a series of events
[3828.84 --> 3837.80]  ended up um trying to unify a lot of that through a another service 15 hey there's too many standards
[3837.80 --> 3849.08]  let's add another one uh called air table um and it went flawlessly yeah okay in fairness to the people
[3849.08 --> 3854.12]  who were being asked to modernize their workflows no problems sometimes sometimes there might have been
[3854.12 --> 3860.12]  some issues with the workflows and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna attach blame to any particular party
[3860.12 --> 3865.96]  um i have personally found some bugs that maybe they were maybe they could have been predicted maybe
[3865.96 --> 3874.60]  they couldn't have um so i i i think that rolling out new workflows and new tools can be a challenge on
[3874.60 --> 3880.52]  both sides there are entire companies that you can come contract in for hundreds of thousands of maybe
[3880.52 --> 3888.60]  over a million dollars to help you do uh to manage change uh and it's tough and some people do better
[3888.60 --> 3896.44]  with it and some people don't and it's part of the process and it's painful heck yeah let's go
[3897.48 --> 3904.44]  heck yeah so yeah it sucks and that was i mean this is a very dramatic very difficult version because
[3904.44 --> 3910.04]  we just did everything this isn't like like getting the writers to change from word to google docs
[3911.48 --> 3917.72]  had pain involved yeah but like was fine no that was not that bad because it's not a huge deal yeah
[3917.72 --> 3926.76]  that and like google docs in time has gotten um has gotten a lot more usable it wasn't that pleasant to
[3926.76 --> 3932.92]  work in except for search search has gotten worse the search company doesn't seem to be able to do search
[3932.92 --> 3939.24]  anymore i know i'm seriously considering switching to duck duck go just to get away from ai summaries some of the default
[3939.24 --> 3945.00]  sorting to sorting by relevance will like uh i was it you that i was talking to when i was showing
[3945.00 --> 3950.76]  that screenshot of my my search results in my inbox i was searching for like flight or something like
[3950.76 --> 3957.48]  that dude and it didn't have my most recent one that was marked on red but had like old like ticket
[3957.48 --> 3962.84]  itineraries and stuff like what are you duck duck go has ai summaries oh wow i didn't know that i
[3962.84 --> 3966.60]  actually did not know that either welcome to current year maybe you can turn them off or something yeah
[3966.60 --> 3973.00]  there's no escape um yeah dude i i constantly get flack because i i'll be like hey can you like link me
[3973.00 --> 3978.36]  that doc that you have open and they'll be like oh you're shared on it oh my god like no that makes
[3978.36 --> 3985.40]  me scream sure but i can't find it can you just link it to me i need the link it's it's not going to come up
[3985.40 --> 3990.60]  then i will literally search for the title of the document in my google drive and then show them my
[3990.60 --> 3996.60]  laptop and be like i i believe you that i'm shared on it but like i it i cannot find it
[3998.28 --> 4003.88]  i don't know speaking of not being able to find things or speaking of ai summaries on the modern
[4003.88 --> 4010.36]  internet let's talk about house fresh highlighting more issues with the modern internet if you're not
[4010.36 --> 4015.88]  familiar with house fresh uh they were featured very prominently in this video on our channel this
[4015.88 --> 4022.12]  week that uh gained a little bit of momentum and i think really resonated with the audience in a big
[4022.12 --> 4027.80]  way great video by the way uh oh yeah thank you i thought elijah and the house fresh team did a
[4027.80 --> 4035.48]  tremendous job it's fantastic in a nutshell house fresh reviews uh air purifiers and they ended up
[4035.48 --> 4043.88]  embroiled in some legal trouble over accusations that they were treating a particular brand unfairly
[4043.88 --> 4051.88]  and we kind of dig into we talked to house fresh we talked to the brand that uh is has been legally
[4051.88 --> 4062.20]  involved with them and dug as best as we could to find the full story anyway what we kind of the
[4062.20 --> 4068.92]  conclude the basic conclusion that we came to is that companies suing independent reviewers over
[4068.92 --> 4077.72]  results that they don't like or agree with is not good yeah and not going to be tolerated and just days
[4077.72 --> 4087.24]  later house fresh highlighted another issue with modern trying to be a reviewer that could be a major
[4087.24 --> 4094.12]  problem so it's actually this tweet right here that prompted me to flag this for the wanshow crew
[4094.76 --> 4102.20]  what they're calling the great decoupling and i'll get into a little bit of the more uh detailed bits
[4102.20 --> 4109.16]  in a second here but what you're looking at here is clicks versus impressions so obviously impressions
[4109.16 --> 4114.92]  would be the bigger number over here and clicks would be the number over here so impressions are purple
[4114.92 --> 4121.32]  and clicks are blue and even when they were like shadow banned in google these numbers track together
[4121.32 --> 4126.44]  your impressions go way down so your clicks go way down and then there was a recovery but then ever
[4126.44 --> 4134.60]  since about february of this year there's been this um this phenomenon that has been accelerating
[4134.60 --> 4139.88]  called the great decoupling when instead of these things mostly tracking up and down together
[4139.88 --> 4148.68]  they now have a very substantial spread between them and the culprit appears to be
[4150.12 --> 4155.40]  um ai summaries so here i'll i'll read through the thing so they showed the difference between
[4155.40 --> 4160.52]  impressions and clicks that are growing farther apart mainly due to ai overview results in google
[4161.16 --> 4169.72]  um so instead of search engines referring people to the original source material from which they got
[4169.72 --> 4176.44]  their information they're basically just scraping the page spitting that back out to whoever searching
[4176.44 --> 4183.40]  for it and then no longer referring anybody through to the original source which means no ad revenue
[4183.40 --> 4189.40]  no revenue whatsoever because it means death it's not like they're paying licensing fees for this content
[4189.40 --> 4194.84]  i mean we talked last week about what this is going to mean for news organizations but and you know i guess
[4194.84 --> 4198.76]  you could you could actually probably kind of classify house fresh the same way i mean it's
[4199.64 --> 4207.00]  news kind of about how good a particular product is okay it's not quite news but i think you guys can
[4207.00 --> 4214.68]  understand the parallels here and the impact that it would have on a news organization and also on a review organization
[4215.64 --> 4215.96]  um
[4215.96 --> 4218.04]  um
[4218.60 --> 4220.04]  our discussion question here
[4221.56 --> 4223.16]  is like what what do
[4225.08 --> 4230.52]  what does someone like house fresh do how do they survive when they're not getting clicked through
[4230.52 --> 4236.52]  what would stop google from taking the affiliate revenue even spitting out the ai summary including
[4236.52 --> 4242.36]  affiliate links because that's that's how someone like a house fresh survives is they objectively test
[4243.24 --> 4247.56]  as a particular device and they say hey if you like what you saw here's the affiliate link that's
[4247.56 --> 4251.96]  how they make their money there's a couple people in full plane chat saying how do you even how do you
[4251.96 --> 4258.68]  know it's definitely the ai summary is having this effect what else changed and like have you analyzed how
[4258.68 --> 4266.68]  you use the internet these days like this is a this is an extremely palpable change i'm honestly surprised
[4266.68 --> 4270.60]  it hasn't caused more of an effect like i that's uh
[4273.80 --> 4280.60]  i yeah i don't know people change the algo all the time yeah and you can go back through the history of
[4281.80 --> 4287.40]  algo changes and watch that those two things match each other house fresh is not the only ones talking
[4287.40 --> 4293.08]  about this and then suddenly it decouples and the change that lines up with it is ai summaries this is
[4293.08 --> 4298.20]  like i don't know man i don't know how much more you need what is this going to mean for the lab
[4299.56 --> 4303.16]  uh this isn't doesn't mean anything new for the lab because i knew this the whole time
[4305.00 --> 4309.08]  pretty much we've talked about this pretty extensively in the past how the direction ai was
[4309.08 --> 4313.88]  going at the end of the day you were just going to ask your llm you know hey what computer should i
[4313.88 --> 4319.40]  buy and it'll scrape the crap out of our results and all we can really do is create formats that are more
[4319.40 --> 4323.64]  engaging than interacting with an ai chatbot and i think that's something that we have a lot of good
[4323.64 --> 4328.84]  ideas for how to do but it will take time
[4332.04 --> 4339.08]  i know the lab's been going really slow if anything i think our error with the lab was trying to go too
[4339.08 --> 4348.76]  fast so if we do anything i don't have it with respect to with respect if we do anything around speed it
[4348.76 --> 4356.52]  will be continue to slow down things have been pretty good it's yeah it's not moving crazy fast
[4356.52 --> 4363.80]  uh but like linus said that's by design um i know there was there was a post on the subreddit recently
[4365.88 --> 4373.32]  i lost my like actual official reddit account really yeah why i can log into it on geodude
[4373.32 --> 4380.04]  like on your computer at home or your old computer my old computer but there's no way to recover the
[4380.04 --> 4385.48]  account i cannot for the life for some reason it's not in my password manager i have no idea why so
[4385.48 --> 4390.12]  wait you don't mean you can log into it you mean you are logged into it it's it's session logged yeah
[4390.12 --> 4396.12]  so i can i can open my browser go to reddit and i'm in the account uh-huh but there's no i can't set a
[4396.12 --> 4404.04]  password i can't assign an email to it there's no single sign-on that is attached to it it doesn't
[4404.04 --> 4410.12]  seem to be attached to any email i think like way back on reddit you could make accounts without
[4410.12 --> 4415.56]  assigning them to emails and for like privacy reasons i just did that but i can't retroactively
[4415.56 --> 4421.64]  assign it to an email now and i have no idea what the password is it's not on my password manager
[4421.64 --> 4426.76]  i have no idea what's going on there so i need to make a new one but i wanted to i wanted to
[4426.76 --> 4432.92]  respond we have a reddit contact like we could probably get it sorted out yeah but i wanted to
[4432.92 --> 4437.40]  respond to that thread but couldn't but anyways there was a thread talking about how the labs is is
[4437.40 --> 4442.60]  is moving slow and what i was going to essentially answer with is yes absolutely and i cannot promise
[4442.60 --> 4447.80]  it will move faster i can probably promise it will continue to not move faster um but there is
[4447.80 --> 4452.28]  really cool plans we're probably going to be doing stuff on it soon we're doing a lot of hiring
[4453.56 --> 4458.28]  a lot which is i i'm kind of like if we if we make a video on this there's going to be a bunch of
[4458.28 --> 4463.32]  blurry people and i was i was thinking of just having like titles over their heads nice so you can tell
[4463.32 --> 4467.96]  like what we're hiring and kind of what they're going to be doing but it's a bunch of people that
[4467.96 --> 4474.68]  are technically still on like sims with a little diamond above them um yeah and there's there's some cool
[4474.68 --> 4480.28]  stuff coming down the pipe too it's uh it's been good it's just speed is not really going to be the
[4480.28 --> 4486.44]  the name of the game eventually we want to get like when a when a vertical is up to speed the output of
[4486.44 --> 4492.36]  reviews within that vertical ideally will be pretty high but the speed of adding new verticals especially
[4492.36 --> 4498.12]  that is not going to speed up um yeah i'm very happy with with where the lab is at right now
[4498.12 --> 4507.24]  all right well let's talk a little bit more about ai stuff oh after we do our sponsors okay ah dang it
[4507.24 --> 4512.92]  this this topic wait we didn't even finish the announcements i will get to them this topic
[4512.92 --> 4521.48]  transitions so well into the next topic i wanted to do okay so you and i have kind of seen it coming
[4521.48 --> 4526.60]  for a long time that ai is just going to be scraping every website and is going to be just making that
[4526.60 --> 4537.08]  content its own oh um and if anything it looks like if legal precedent is what i understand it to be
[4537.08 --> 4545.96]  that's going to get easier for ai companies a federal judge in california has ruled that using copyrighted
[4545.96 --> 4556.36]  books to train ai models is fair use as long as you purchased them but pirated books those are still
[4556.36 --> 4564.28]  off limits who's the decision sided with anthropic stating that transforming legally bought physical
[4564.28 --> 4572.20]  books into digital formats for ai training is spectacularly transformative and therefore qualifies
[4572.20 --> 4582.92]  as fair use fair use here was upheld even though the entire book was copied because the ai model doesn't
[4582.92 --> 4588.28]  reproduce the book's contents or and this one this is where i kind of go
[4589.88 --> 4594.68]  or compete with the original work yeah that second part doesn't seem legitimate or true
[4594.68 --> 4602.12]  at all another key part of the ruling is that converting a legally bought print book into a digital file
[4602.12 --> 4608.44]  even just for saving space or searchability is itself considered a transformative fair use
[4612.04 --> 4617.08]  that's interesting that's very interesting to me because every time i ever opened a book
[4617.08 --> 4626.12]  it said something something reproducing this in any form want any form is prohibited by law yeah um
[4626.12 --> 4634.04]  the judge emphasized that this print to digital conversion is separate from broader llm training
[4634.04 --> 4638.36]  and qualifies as fair use for its own reasons
[4640.52 --> 4644.20]  shall we allow that to sink in for a moment it's very interesting
[4645.72 --> 4652.04]  our discussion question here is uh is is a couple of hypothetical scenarios that i kind of came up with
[4652.04 --> 4659.08]  um as i was as i was reading this um when i was going through topics for when today if making a digital
[4659.08 --> 4665.48]  copy of a book you bought is fair use could this apply to backing up blu-rays then so that i can watch
[4665.48 --> 4675.40]  them on my plex on whatever screen and whatever codec that i deem most convenient for myself but my
[4675.40 --> 4684.36]  understanding is that in certain jurisdictions that is in fact not allowed because just like with a book
[4684.36 --> 4690.92]  when you buy a movie you are not in fact buying the movie you do not own the movie you are buying a
[4690.92 --> 4699.16]  license for which that disc is a physical key to use that media in the way that is that it is licensed
[4699.16 --> 4705.32]  for like for instance and you can you cannot like this and you cannot agree with it and that's totally
[4706.12 --> 4711.40]  totally your thing go for it you cannot like it but when you buy a blu-ray at willow video
[4712.04 --> 4719.24]  you're not allowed to like host a public event in a public space and exhibit that blu-ray you're not
[4719.24 --> 4726.52]  allowed to rent a commercial a little commercial property set up a big you know buy high senses 110
[4726.52 --> 4732.52]  inch tv put it in the front get some folding chairs and make a little theater and then charge people
[4732.52 --> 4740.52]  admission to see it you are not you do not own a commercial license to that work so to me
[4742.20 --> 4750.68]  unless you are buying a commercial license for the book i don't see how there i don't see how those two
[4750.68 --> 4757.32]  things can both be true if that makes sense yeah i'm not saying one is right or one is wrong even
[4757.32 --> 4766.36]  i have my opinions but what i am saying is that those two things cannot coexist a movie a work of
[4766.36 --> 4773.32]  creative art being licensed only for personal use and not for reproduction or public display
[4773.88 --> 4780.68]  and a book that is licensed only for personal use and not for reproduction or public display
[4781.32 --> 4787.56]  should not have such dramatically different rules applied to them somebody needs to do some prompt
[4787.56 --> 4792.36]  engineering and get it to output the entire book obviously not at once it won't do that but if you could
[4792.36 --> 4797.72]  get it to output the entire book like paragraph by paragraph and then prove the output i feel like
[4797.72 --> 4803.08]  you could dunk this so i had an i had so i had another hypothetical question here so if you were
[4803.08 --> 4808.20]  gonna so my understanding is a big part of the argument from the judge is that it doesn't output the entire
[4808.20 --> 4815.32]  book like you said but here's the thing even if it only output pieces of the book like
[4815.32 --> 4825.24]  so it's still ingesting it for commercial use and reselling it so my so my second hypothetical example
[4825.24 --> 4833.88]  is okay so by that logic could i take that disastrous garbage dumpster fire of a trilogy the hobbit movies
[4835.08 --> 4843.88]  fan edit them into a single movie and then as long as what i bought three blu-rays like sell the output
[4845.32 --> 4852.04]  that's crazy yeah and i'm not saying it's crazy because it's probably really good yeah i'm not
[4852.04 --> 4858.20]  saying it's crazy like no one should do it i'd watch the crap out of that oh yeah i'm saying it's crazy
[4858.20 --> 4865.08]  in the context of copyright law as i understand it at the very least and look i'm not a legal scholar
[4865.64 --> 4872.52]  what's up when bingo chronified and full plane chat said holy i just typed read me the first chapter of
[4872.52 --> 4877.24]  harry potter and the philosopher's stone into meta ai and it actually worked so yeah get it to output
[4877.24 --> 4885.24]  the whole book over time log the outputs and uh disney will love that let's blow some stuff up wild
[4886.52 --> 4891.80]  i think i i this is this is not a question it's a request like i hope that somebody goes through the
[4891.80 --> 4897.56]  work of doing that um because i i think you just immediately dunk this court case by doing that
[4897.56 --> 4906.20]  yeah how would it know what the book says well no wait what no if they didn't steal it what
[4907.32 --> 4912.44]  you haven't heard the topic have you yeah just reproduce the whole thing maybe write a write an eighth one
[4914.68 --> 4916.92]  dan eight
[4919.48 --> 4923.40]  anyway um that's i think all i have to say about that i
[4923.40 --> 4927.88]  full full full full full chatter asking if dan is hallucinating because he's an ai could be
[4929.00 --> 4931.24]  i can't do m dashes in person it sucks

[5156.52 --> 5164.04]  legit response i think a friend of mine sent me a screenshot uh i was more of an icp kid but you know
[5164.04 --> 5171.80]  blink 182 is value more than i'd probably like to like legitimately yikes they're so sweet they're
[5171.80 --> 5180.12]  like the best they're the best group of people all right dude i dropped the intro to an icp song in the
[5180.12 --> 5186.20]  live stream yesterday just to see if elijah would have any idea what i was talking about like one person
[5186.20 --> 5191.96]  in the entire comment section had any idea what i was talking about that is insane yeah that's the least
[5191.96 --> 5197.48]  thing i was ever going to expect out of your mouth what no i'm not surprised at all icp he said he's
[5197.48 --> 5201.80]  yeah he he would definitely fit into that crowd yeah he's very sweet i laughed you i did like some
[5201.80 --> 5208.68]  of their songs uh but yeah blink 182 is my favorite band for like ever um somebody said one of my friends
[5208.68 --> 5215.96]  sent me a screenshot recently that showed uh what was it like classic music something like that uh on
[5215.96 --> 5222.04]  like a you know song selector thing and it was blink 182 classic it was something i don't remember
[5222.04 --> 5228.28]  let me golden oldies let me find it let me figure out exactly what it was i'm old now classic alternative
[5228.28 --> 5235.24]  like what is yeah let me like what would what would blink be i'm gonna dig it up that's a huge yikes
[5235.24 --> 5241.96]  it crushed my soul a little bit did he even send it here
[5244.60 --> 5249.32]  i think people are asking me people are asking me what a juggalo is i don't know
[5251.00 --> 5256.12]  oldies but i do know that he walks through the streets winking at freaks with a two liter stuck in
[5256.12 --> 5264.28]  his butt cheeks yeah yeah see i remember that line but yeah oldies look uh oh wow all the small things
[5264.28 --> 5273.24]  oldies wow huge yikes rough um rough all right yeah a lot of oldie stations like the best of the 70s
[5273.24 --> 5286.60]  80s 90s and 2000s for all you new fathers out there remember going to the club britney spears toxic
[5286.60 --> 5291.64]  equals classical music now yeah no i don't think i can handle that spice girls i don't think i can handle
[5291.64 --> 5300.76]  that stop right now thank you very much i don't get a ding for that
[5303.88 --> 5307.40]  fine i'm still learning the new rubric this is very difficult
[5309.64 --> 5313.32]  all right do i ding do i not okay what are we supposed to be doing oh merch messages we should
[5313.32 --> 5317.32]  definitely do some more yeah you want to hit us with some merch messages dan yeah sure well wait hold
[5317.32 --> 5323.32]  on a second uh we still haven't done the rest of the announcements uh let's let's do a merch message
[5323.32 --> 5328.36]  or two first all right hey dan the man and the other two absolutely love the cargo pants uh have
[5328.36 --> 5333.72]  you seen an uptick in sales since the shift fashion review also more colors of the new shorts planned i
[5333.72 --> 5339.40]  don't think we've seen any uh impact on sales one way or the other since the shift fashion review
[5339.40 --> 5345.48]  still cool uh yeah yeah i mean like i said the it's super neat that we're even in the same conversation as
[5345.48 --> 5352.76]  like global brands uh i believe that the creator warehouse team has shot their their video sort of
[5352.76 --> 5358.28]  um looking at some of what shift fashion said responding to some of it i i haven't actually
[5358.28 --> 5362.76]  watched it yet uh i think it's still in the editing queue so that'll be coming up on float plane sometime
[5362.76 --> 5369.40]  in the next little bit lmg.gg float plane and then it will also be going live on lmg clips which is where
[5369.40 --> 5376.60]  when clips go just so that uh i think the optics of us responding on a paid platform would maybe not
[5376.60 --> 5380.20]  have been that great so that's fine so we're gonna have it available for free i don't know if it'll be
[5380.20 --> 5385.24]  up on lmg clips forever i think a lot of the time when we put exclusives up on lmg clips they don't
[5385.24 --> 5390.60]  stay up forever so i i actually literally do not know what the plan is there but we are gonna have
[5391.16 --> 5397.88]  uh i think the biggest thing is it doesn't like really make sense to be a mainline lct video but then
[5397.88 --> 5402.20]  like it doesn't make more sense no like what someone someone disagrees with me on cotton poly
[5402.20 --> 5408.12]  blends so we're gonna make like an ltt video i don't really see how that's valid our response
[5408.12 --> 5415.64]  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah battle of the fabrics i'm sure people would care just maybe not our people
[5415.64 --> 5419.80]  yeah someone someone would care someone would care a lot yeah
[5419.80 --> 5430.84]  sure hey dot dll can we take a moment to rant about google tv os why do smart tvs only last a
[5430.84 --> 5438.60]  couple years bring back the plasma colon capital d period i love the videos and physical products
[5438.60 --> 5446.04]  keep them uh yeah you you know plasmas were like had longevity issues right that was like notoriously
[5446.04 --> 5453.56]  like that was like the drawback of them yeah other than the cost was it ironic uh were they being a
[5454.36 --> 5460.52]  funny person i don't think so were they being a city haha they might have been uh if we look at
[5460.52 --> 5466.60]  context and assume that they're they have all of their brain i'm actually not sure if i agree that
[5466.60 --> 5472.68]  smart tvs only last a couple of years either though because you can even if you're even if your os goes out
[5472.68 --> 5479.24]  of date or you know gets like kind of laggy and unresponsive most modern smart tvs that i've
[5479.24 --> 5484.84]  interacted with have a mode where you can set them to fire up just on one of their inputs and then you
[5484.84 --> 5492.92]  can just get like an android tv box and then you like can just run that that's how my c2 works yeah i feel
[5492.92 --> 5499.72]  like tvs have been pretty solid i mean until you break yours that was not me that was not me
[5499.72 --> 5505.72]  really you're gonna throw your so under the bus rather than just take it like a man i also didn't
[5505.72 --> 5511.08]  say i just said it wasn't me well you're the only two people who live there you're gonna throw your
[5511.08 --> 5519.08]  bird under the bus maybe maybe it was a bird yes maybe a bird ran into it 26 gram budgie managed to
[5519.08 --> 5523.80]  break your television yeah but you should have seen the other guy
[5523.80 --> 5531.08]  one of them one of them got out uh trying to give medicine or something i don't remember what
[5531.08 --> 5537.40]  was happening but one of them got out in a in a bathroom and it kept flying into the mirror lightly
[5537.40 --> 5540.68]  it didn't have a lot of distance to really get up to speed but it kept flying into the mirror kind
[5540.68 --> 5547.00]  of bumping it thinking that it could fly there could it once it landed classic budgie it's all like scared
[5547.00 --> 5553.48]  and stuff it lands sees itself in a mirror and immediately is like friend hello i'm making
[5553.48 --> 5562.52]  friends now anyways sorry no one cares it was funny uh one more hey duke leonard and bread rsvp'd to a
[5562.52 --> 5568.60]  wedding but found out someone i really dislike is going what should i do go anyways yes the anonymous
[5568.60 --> 5575.96]  button hasn't worked on a merch message for a while oh yeah these are none of these are anonymous oh wait
[5575.96 --> 5581.16]  here's one this one's anonymous okay skill issue maybe you could just type the name anonymous but it
[5581.16 --> 5588.12]  could it could actually be a problem so maybe we can look into it um i don't know what would have
[5588.12 --> 5593.40]  someone i really dislike is going okay well i do have actually some pretty good advice for this
[5593.40 --> 5602.52]  that person you dislike don't them oh damn it i mean don't hook up with them at the wedding it's good
[5602.52 --> 5610.12]  advice it's good advice where were you a decade ago yeah see see i could have saved you dan i could
[5610.12 --> 5618.76]  have saved you thanks um okay i ruined a reception more advice more advice okay don't strip down
[5618.76 --> 5622.36]  don't strip down in the middle of the wedding
[5626.68 --> 5630.84]  and if you do don't dance don't dance on the table
[5633.80 --> 5640.60]  okay in all seriousness it's not your day yeah it's the couple's day if they want you there
[5640.60 --> 5648.28]  then you know what do your best if you absolutely can i mean i don't think it's uh like it like if you
[5648.28 --> 5657.56]  cannot attend this event without you know fighting this person that then don't go right yeah don't
[5657.56 --> 5663.24]  don't do anything that would disrupt yes it is not your day it is their day and but with that in mind
[5663.24 --> 5670.92]  it is their day it is not your day if they really want to fight have a pre-written uh in an envelope
[5670.92 --> 5674.60]  invite to them and if they start making anything hand them the envelope and the envelope is a time
[5674.60 --> 5679.72]  and place and so if you wanna if if you want to be there to support them because they obviously want
[5679.72 --> 5685.08]  you there otherwise they wouldn't have sent you an invitation then you should just you could politely
[5685.08 --> 5690.12]  ask to be seated at a table as far away from this person as the venue allows and unless it's
[5690.12 --> 5696.20]  the bride and groom yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ask like a bridesmaid uh or like someone in the it's
[5696.20 --> 5701.24]  one of the groomsmen or something and if that absolutely cannot be accommodated because it's a
[5701.24 --> 5705.24]  super small wedding or something like that then you just you have to make the choice that's right for you
[5705.80 --> 5711.24]  i would recommend if you are not able to attend you know send a like a nicer gift you know at least so
[5711.24 --> 5715.80]  you can show you were thinking of them you know drop them a note on the day send them a send them a
[5715.80 --> 5719.96]  gift that's kind of on the nicer side uh just make some effort make some effort that's all
[5723.72 --> 5725.32]  don't be dramatic yeah
[5729.96 --> 5735.96]  oh sure yeah finish announcements maybe um no what are you doing my job now we're gonna get yelled at
[5735.96 --> 5741.88]  so much sammy sammy just appeared like slenderman a second ago so he did what is he still doing here
[5741.88 --> 5746.52]  he should go home judging you for not doing the announcement on time there's never been a better
[5746.52 --> 5754.92]  time to subscribe to floatplane and here's oh three reasons one tons of amazing content exclusives
[5754.92 --> 5762.44]  coming up we have an upcoming linus and taren our ceo interview to mark taren's two-year anniversary on
[5762.44 --> 5770.12]  july 1st um that dropping the same day oh okay so that's coming out on the same day as his two-year
[5770.12 --> 5777.00]  anniversary we also have linus reacts to awkward staff interactions so we shot that ages ago i've
[5777.00 --> 5785.40]  actually talked about that on wan show that was very uncomfortable for me to for me to watch i was
[5785.40 --> 5794.92]  watching people describing their first time meeting me and how awkward i was we also have the i spent 24
[5794.92 --> 5802.44]  hours with linus in taiwan fake news the last two are coming out during lime day speaking of lime day
[5802.44 --> 5809.64]  that's reason number the second flow plane members are going to get 24 hour early access to the deals
[5809.64 --> 5816.44]  that we will have at ltdstore.com they will be announced next week and that is oh what do you not
[5816.44 --> 5823.56]  know about this no i know about it we don't have floatplane logging on the global store so okay luke's
[5823.56 --> 5830.60]  gonna send a quick message yeah we will uh figure out some stuff and finally number three is early
[5830.60 --> 5836.44]  access to scrapyard wars we don't have a set date for the first episode but like last year each episode

[5844.36 --> 5850.12]  dollar tier will net you all of these the amazing exclusives already out like the scrapped original
[5850.12 --> 5856.92]  transparent screwdriver from a year ago what is this scrapped original transparent screwdriver from a
[5856.92 --> 5865.40]  year ago what am i looking at that's our shopify one million orders thing is this oh oh yeah okay yeah
[5865.40 --> 5872.52]  there you go he's doing screwdriver things and i think there was one other one other thing what is what
[5872.52 --> 5879.72]  am i looking at dennis prank extended okay yeah cool uh so that's uh that's a brand new exclusive
[5879.72 --> 5884.60]  that just went up uh you can also hang out in the floatplane wan chat uh so don't miss out on any of
[5884.60 --> 5891.40]  this by going to lmg.gg slash floatplane evil fuzzy asks what about the three dollar og subscribers yeah
[5891.40 --> 5899.40]  yeah yeah yeah yeah of course don't worry we got you all right topics you ready for a topic uh yeah
[5899.40 --> 5906.68]  tesla has launched robo taxi kind of last sunday tesla launched sort of it's highly anticipated
[5907.88 --> 5915.48]  uh robo taxi service in austin texas this launch included a limited geofenced area of austin that
[5915.48 --> 5922.44]  has been thoroughly mapped by tesla and it was available by invite only so we've got a link to
[5922.44 --> 5929.24]  the geofenced area and then we have a google maps link for reference so i'm just gonna pull these up
[5929.24 --> 5939.96]  here and screen share with you guys so here's google maps and here is the tesla area and but
[5939.96 --> 5956.68]  oh wow uh is that is that as small as it looks it's not all of one city oh it's not even close to all of
[5957.24 --> 5964.12]  one city it's like yeah uh okay what are the city limits what am i even what am i even looking at here
[5964.12 --> 5973.48]  so here map is wait where's the two where's the 290 okay why am i yeah why am i looking at why am i
[5973.48 --> 5982.28]  looking at these layers okay so lake shore boulevard is here uh why am i having such a hard time with this
[5985.00 --> 5989.00]  did i zoom in on kind of the wrong spot oh i think i might have lost it
[5989.00 --> 5997.08]  here it is okay i think i got it now so basically it's just along
[6001.32 --> 6008.28]  it's just along here why is why is the 35 not labeled here okay what is this one
[6009.08 --> 6015.88]  is this like 71 or 290 or something what is this okay i'm so confused oh here's the 71 oh okay no it's
[6015.88 --> 6018.76]  a little bigger it's a little bigger than i thought it's a little bigger than i thought okay
[6018.76 --> 6024.76]  here we go here we go here we go so the 71 here where it converts to the 290 that's right here there
[6024.76 --> 6031.00]  we go we've managed to we've managed to map this out here and then it kind of goes up to here and
[6031.00 --> 6039.00]  kind of kind of to here so it doesn't make its way into rolling wood here so that's wow so it's this
[6039.00 --> 6052.28]  little chunk of austin right here cool can we see it i mean that's something you know right that's
[6052.28 --> 6058.12]  kind of something so if we if we go to the the satellite view yeah i mean oh yeah okay i was
[6058.12 --> 6063.80]  gonna say i mean that's most of the like populous areas but i uh austin's a austin's a really big
[6063.80 --> 6070.68]  uh austin's a really big city wait this isn't still austin is it no it can't be how big is austin
[6073.08 --> 6084.04]  yeah okay okay okay okay uh neat so that's cool um a number of kind of pro tesla influencers received
[6084.04 --> 6092.68]  invites for the service and tesla has not stated when the service will be available to the general public
[6094.12 --> 6100.36]  the trial includes 10 to 20 model y vehicles that have a robo taxi decal on the side of the vehicle
[6100.92 --> 6106.52]  and cars included a tesla employed safety monitor in the front passenger seat that can react to
[6106.52 --> 6115.00]  dangerous situations by pressing an emergency button got it all fares within the service area were set to a
[6115.00 --> 6120.76]  flat four dollars and twenty cents nice and there are multiple videos of passengers live streaming their
[6120.76 --> 6126.20]  experience from start to finish there were some issues with one passenger finding their tesla at
[6126.20 --> 6130.68]  the pickup location oh there were some issues with passengers finding their teslas at the pickup location
[6131.32 --> 6138.04]  this is like pokemon hunting one person on herbert ong's live stream said but it's like robo taxi hunting
[6138.04 --> 6142.84]  and the riders were asked by the safety monitor to show identification when getting into the vehicle
[6143.48 --> 6148.28]  once seated the rear scene screen instructs riders to fasten their seat belts and presents a
[6148.28 --> 6154.12]  start ride button because riders booked the car through the tesla app their preferred music app is
[6154.12 --> 6158.76]  available on the rear screen with playlists and save tracks that's pretty cool the rear screen also
[6158.76 --> 6163.88]  includes buttons for support if you ever need assistance or pull over to end the trip early
[6164.68 --> 6171.64]  most riders described their trips as smooth and uneventful although there are a few clips where
[6171.64 --> 6179.64]  less than perfect behavior was caught so dan i actually need your help for this bit because we don't want
[6179.64 --> 6185.00]  to watch these videos on the wan show because that would be rude so what we're going to do instead is
[6185.00 --> 6189.48]  we're going to link everyone and we're going to have a little watch party yeah so if you could link them
[6189.48 --> 6196.20]  to the first one first we're going to start watching together so luke do you want to load it up sure one sec
[6196.20 --> 6205.80]  okay and
[6205.80 --> 6206.20]  and
[6210.36 --> 6213.24]  ready luke yep and play
[6215.80 --> 6216.04]  okay
[6216.04 --> 6229.48]  oh wow it was going really slow okay so that's what we're supposed to see what so the tesla in the
[6229.48 --> 6235.56]  left lane is one of the one of the cyber cab teslas oh not the car that's driving okay i was like the
[6235.56 --> 6240.36]  car that's driving seemed the car that's driving seems to be doing fine but that one in the left lane is
[6240.36 --> 6248.92]  going like super slow okay got it interesting i mean i would say that that's probably not the end of
[6248.92 --> 6253.08]  the world as far as things go uh okay number two ready
[6255.96 --> 6260.92]  and go oh boy i got an ad brilliant
[6260.92 --> 6268.76]  what happened in this one i'm behind you it's kind of break slams it seems
[6270.28 --> 6275.80]  oh wow i don't have audio but i think that's what happened yep just for reasons
[6277.24 --> 6283.72]  i mean okay again i'd rather it you know stop for reasons um rather than
[6283.72 --> 6292.12]  accelerate for reasons so that's something um number three is a safety monitor intervening for a
[6292.12 --> 6297.64]  ups truck that is backing up so we can see uh this is from dave lee
[6300.04 --> 6304.68]  and it's going it's going it's going it's going and
[6304.68 --> 6313.88]  this ups truck is coming here it comes here it comes we're just we're chilling we're chilling
[6315.24 --> 6318.76]  we're chilling some more we're just going to chill here
[6322.92 --> 6325.08]  these are the kinds of edge cases though that are
[6325.08 --> 6335.80]  the reason that i just but it cuts to the outside when it drives away uh yeah but the safety monitor
[6335.80 --> 6340.60]  doesn't appear to be in the passenger seat anymore there so he's driving uh i'm gonna double check
[6341.24 --> 6345.24]  that's sure what it looks like to me i'm gonna zoom
[6345.24 --> 6354.52]  i can't see very clearly that's what it appears to be to me and then our our
[6354.52 --> 6359.48]  we've got another one that is definitely parked in a parking spot for drop off
[6363.08 --> 6367.40]  let's have a look here so that's number four oh wow uh sure
[6369.40 --> 6373.88]  wow is that is that a handicapped spot but it's like not in at all
[6375.24 --> 6380.36]  i was watching the other one still okay sorry i'm trying to figure out some stuff
[6381.00 --> 6388.60]  okay and you know what grand scheme of things these are all pretty these are all pretty small
[6389.88 --> 6397.32]  issues i'd be interested to see yeah like for the amount of rides that they did and the duration of it
[6397.32 --> 6402.36]  like what the intervention rate is um and like those types of failures and then look at
[6402.36 --> 6408.28]  humans driving in the same area for the same amount of time and the types and severity of the
[6408.28 --> 6414.28]  problems that were caused by them now i do agree i fully expect if we're going to have some robotic
[6414.28 --> 6419.16]  thing driving i'm not okay with it having the same amount of problems that humans have especially
[6419.16 --> 6425.48]  because like something has to be responsible and all that kind of stuff yeah um but i am still interested
[6425.48 --> 6427.24]  just purely in what those stats are
[6433.32 --> 6439.00]  charge nuclei 8300 says robo taxi is allowed to use handicap parking the driver has no legs
[6440.12 --> 6449.24]  or head that's pretty good okay that makes sense that makes sense um discussion question yeah would
[6449.24 --> 6454.60]  you use a service like this in a well-mapped area do you think there is opportunity for this to work
[6454.60 --> 6463.40]  in a busy or challenging environment waymo okay but let's okay okay let's maybe let's not i'm going
[6463.40 --> 6470.36]  to tweak the discussion question a little bit because waymo very clearly has the lead here yes they are
[6470.36 --> 6478.28]  actually operating um unsupervised and when you factor in how few of these cyber cabs are actually roaming
[6478.28 --> 6484.28]  the streets in this very limited geographical area and then if you look at the tweet of the like launch
[6484.28 --> 6493.08]  party and how many uh remote operators are waiting to to take over these things it's not one-to-one i
[6493.08 --> 6500.68]  don't think but they're they're ready for basically them to like not be working uh pretty much and that does
[6500.68 --> 6507.08]  not show a lot of confidence in the actual autonomous functionality of the product to be clear waymo has
[6507.08 --> 6514.68]  the ability to intervene remotely in the operation of their vehicles but i my understanding is that
[6514.68 --> 6519.80]  it's not such a high ratio of available operators to operating vehicles i don't know if you're trying
[6519.80 --> 6525.00]  to meme or not bubbly charizard but the skytrain being fully autonomous does not mean that it's the
[6525.00 --> 6533.88]  equivalent to cyber taxis it's on rails literally there's no traffic literally it's on rails
[6537.08 --> 6542.36]  why does it stop at 1am yeah i mean i don't know
[6544.68 --> 6553.08]  well so that people won't sleep on it because reasons i guess um so more specifically if tesla was
[6553.08 --> 6559.40]  available here if a cyber cab was available here and vancouver was sufficiently mapped or whatever
[6559.40 --> 6564.76]  would you get in one no not at this time i'm not against it forever but not at this time
[6565.80 --> 6575.40]  that was a very small amount of testing to have a significant amount of what seemed like issues that
[6575.40 --> 6580.44]  should be solved in my opinion the really no they didn't smash in anything which is great
[6580.44 --> 6588.92]  the really curious thing to me is a big part of tesla's pitch over the years to investors and
[6588.92 --> 6596.76]  owners of their vehicles has been that they're going to to own the race to mapping data by just
[6596.76 --> 6602.52]  having all of the drivers of all the millions of cars that they've sold driving around mapping these
[6602.52 --> 6608.12]  areas and the way that the goalposts have moved for the launch of this product has been
[6608.12 --> 6613.48]  uh pretty remarkable for me to behold and i i've just got to wonder like is it just that investors
[6613.48 --> 6620.12]  are don't have the tech savvy to to fully understand what it is that they're looking at and how different
[6620.12 --> 6624.76]  what they've deployed is here compared to waymo and even compared to what they've promised in the past
[6624.76 --> 6632.12]  like why did they need to do so much manual mapping of this area if their whole leadership in this space
[6632.12 --> 6639.24]  is that they should have the data already and the claim being made by their ceo is that well because
[6639.24 --> 6644.12]  we have all this mapping data we're going to be able to roll out new areas like fast there's going to be
[6644.12 --> 6649.80]  thousands and thousands of these cyber cabs on the road at you know some period xyz um
[6650.60 --> 6656.12]  but i just i don't understand how we keep believing these claims you know fool me once shame on
[6656.12 --> 6663.40]  shame on me no fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me but like what about the like 12th
[6663.40 --> 6669.32]  time i've been fooled like how who's accountable at that point you for sure
[6673.16 --> 6680.92]  just saying and there's been some comments about it i would get in one i wouldn't use the service those
[6680.92 --> 6686.68]  are different things how wait how are those different i'm having a bit of a hard time with
[6686.68 --> 6695.08]  that um like if i was at an event like if we were at ces oh and it was like oh there's environment
[6695.88 --> 6701.96]  yeah it's it's not so much the risk i just i don't like i'm looking at a service that based on the
[6701.96 --> 6708.20]  videos like barely works right so if you need to go pretty much any time i've ever had to get into a cab i
[6708.20 --> 6714.84]  actually need to be at that place in a relatively okay amount of time um like sure there are examples
[6714.84 --> 6718.92]  where that hasn't been true but that's kind of usually how it's going and if it's just going to
[6718.92 --> 6727.72]  like randomly pull over because a cop is in a parking lot or something like no i'll i'll go with the uber
[6727.72 --> 6734.68]  um i didn't catch the scale last time i was looking at this so it looks like the area they have mapped
[6734.68 --> 6740.04]  is actually no it's like it's like a few it's like a few miles wide and tall and stuff it's not
[6740.04 --> 6746.76]  tiny you could conceivably walk it though it like you would you probably wouldn't but this guy this
[6746.76 --> 6752.12]  man walks like he'll he'll walk an hour i do them walks to go somewhere especially if i'm in a place
[6752.12 --> 6757.72]  that i like yeah so i'm actually i'm gonna drop a dot right here and then i'm gonna get directions to
[6757.72 --> 6762.44]  like kind of a dot like over here yeah luca said you wouldn't call one but if your friend calls one you
[6762.44 --> 6766.44]  would use it yeah like i'm not gonna like not get in it on principle or something you could walk
[6766.44 --> 6771.56]  across the area that they have mapped in on the order of like an hour and and something but in
[6771.56 --> 6777.96]  less than two hours where where were we when we uh can you say it looks it looks like it anyway if i
[6777.96 --> 6782.84]  if i managed to find the right spot again when we did the gamer house the land house uh we were
[6782.84 --> 6788.44]  allowed to say the city we were in yes where were we was it austin i think it was austin yeah that i
[6788.44 --> 6792.60]  probably like have fair enough oh my back
[6797.56 --> 6803.00]  oop all right what do you want to talk about next what do we get what do we get what do we got
[6806.68 --> 6812.92]  riot games nope sure no i'm down with it riot games announced that they are opening up
[6812.92 --> 6818.36]  betting sponsorship opportunities for league of legends and valorant esport teams in the america
[6818.84 --> 6827.72]  and emea they stated that according to sport radar there was a 10.7 billion dollar betting turnover
[6827.72 --> 6835.16]  on just valorant and league of legends in 2024 most of which likely being in unregulated markets
[6835.80 --> 6842.36]  they've partnered with grid to be the required source for official stats in any sports betting
[6842.36 --> 6849.96]  partnerships they were careful to note that official broadcasts and their social channels will not
[6849.96 --> 6856.84]  partake in gambling sponsorships and that teams cannot have their logos on their jerseys
[6857.72 --> 6862.52]  so it will be up to each individual team then to craft how sports betting related content shows up on
[6862.52 --> 6870.76]  their channel within riot's guidelines content platform tos and local regulations riot will also vet
[6870.76 --> 6880.92]  each sponsor sure oh wow oh wow okay good thing to have in here no responsibility for the words
[6880.92 --> 6887.32]  good thing to have in here i take no responsibility for the words that are about to escape between mine
[6887.32 --> 6896.44]  meat folds i wish he was here sammy's extremely hot and spicy take what do you more of these on wancho is that
[6897.00 --> 6905.00]  this is good his tldr is that esports isn't particularly profitable at the team level
[6905.00 --> 6913.80]  so increasing sponsorship dollars for teams plus riot taking steps to regulate this is a positive for me
[6914.44 --> 6920.68]  the sport is maturing and this is the result but of course be responsible
[6924.12 --> 6927.24]  i think it's a good thing for the sport i think it is a
[6929.40 --> 6932.12]  depressingly bad thing for humanity
[6935.00 --> 6941.64]  that's my take yeah i do think it's a good thing for the sport i'm i'm very i'm very proud
[6942.20 --> 6945.24]  that we have never taken a gambling sponsorship
[6946.76 --> 6951.72]  if i had to choose between the survival of the company and the ongoing employment of everyone here
[6953.40 --> 6955.32]  would my principles bend
[6955.32 --> 6965.96]  it's interesting i have nothing to gain by having this conversation in public and only your opinion of me to lose
[6965.96 --> 6974.92]  the truth is i don't know that's tough i actually don't know tough to identify that scenario you know
[6976.04 --> 6976.20]  well
[6978.28 --> 6979.64]  yeah because there'd always be like
[6980.84 --> 6986.44]  there'd always there'd always be another way like another way could be we we cut staff fans
[6986.44 --> 6999.00]  sure sure i could i'm not selling nick like right now no you're not um denoli 444 says luke and linus
[6999.00 --> 7003.24]  have you seen the gambling stats for young adults in canada it's pretty bad it's depressing it it's
[7003.24 --> 7009.56]  it's because it's been extremely normalized like i i i honestly never thought i'd see this it was it was
[7009.56 --> 7017.24]  it's totally taboo it's quaint to see an old episode of like the simpsons or something where like you know
[7017.24 --> 7023.64]  oh oh the the the the guys are over for yeah the guys are over for gambling night why did it
[7024.28 --> 7030.04]  like i don't know i don't know if the simpsons ever did it but you know like sitcoms did that you know like
[7031.00 --> 7035.16]  aren't you a cop yeah whatever it's poker night you know like like that bit
[7035.16 --> 7042.92]  it's now i don't i don't think anyone would even bat an eye these days no like if luke and i gambled
[7042.92 --> 7048.76]  right now would anybody care it would be normal content it would be normal streaming content which
[7048.76 --> 7054.60]  is sad the platforms wouldn't care the audience wouldn't care you watch sports which never used
[7054.60 --> 7059.96]  to talk about it ever it used to actually they would actively try to get stuff shut down and now it
[7059.96 --> 7065.08]  is the main advertiser for like everything dude i i talked about it already the casters
[7065.08 --> 7071.88]  talk about it i talked about it already but it bears talking about again or bears merits talking
[7071.88 --> 7079.72]  about again i watched the stanley cup finals this year i couldn't believe how brazenly they were
[7079.72 --> 7085.72]  promoting problematic behaviors problematic gambling behaviors they weren't just saying you know
[7085.72 --> 7093.56]  you can gamble know your limit play within it like that is in the past now that was now it's like
[7093.56 --> 7098.44]  before now it's like bet on this one don't forget to bet on that one but have you bet on this other
[7098.44 --> 7103.64]  one yet oh oh can you put in enough bets be quick it's gonna like the betting for this is gonna close
[7103.64 --> 7106.68]  at a certain don't bet on just one team bet on three teams like
[7106.68 --> 7115.32]  there's a there's a commercial that i saw recently where somebody like they have a jersey on and they
[7115.32 --> 7120.52]  place a bet for that team and then they're like friend comes over and they're wearing a different
[7120.52 --> 7125.80]  jersey that's the one i'm talking about that's a horrible commercial it's that is a terrifying
[7125.80 --> 7127.48]  commercial because it is promoting
[7127.48 --> 7136.28]  stupid betting habits yeah just betting at any time for any reason for any constantly no research
[7136.28 --> 7141.24]  no thought process betting based on the most recent random thing you saw that is what they're
[7141.24 --> 7149.88]  promoting it's horrible it's actually so bad god it like ruins people's lives all the time and i don't
[7149.88 --> 7159.64]  understand it's so weird to me that so few people hold this opinion now it's so odd to me like is this
[7159.64 --> 7166.84]  me just being a boomer hit these two messages all these young kids and they're gambling these two messages
[7166.84 --> 7175.32]  are back to back in float plane chat trash cat says and i'll do the other one first it's the frenchiest fry
[7175.32 --> 7182.84]  says my boy scout troop did a fantasy football competition and fantasy football can be fun it can be
[7184.12 --> 7191.64]  but oftentimes there's money involved and i think it's not a ridiculously wild take to say that
[7191.64 --> 7199.88]  playing for not money could could lead to playing for money could potentially if you are if you are the
[7199.88 --> 7208.20]  kind of person who is susceptible to be drawn in to that lifestyle right next to them my younger brother
[7208.20 --> 7215.72]  got hooked on gambling and is like ten thousand dollars in debt those two messages right there dude i
[7215.72 --> 7224.44]  taught i talked about how how much i hated especially after watching mark mark rober's video on how rigged
[7224.44 --> 7233.24]  amusement uh like amusement centers and arcades are i hated how much those games were training my kids
[7233.24 --> 7240.12]  for gambling whenever we'd go we'd go into them it's it's it's gambling with training wheels it's kitty
[7240.12 --> 7249.24]  gambling yeah it feels like that whole i i think it's nescafe do you know this story am i is the wrong
[7249.24 --> 7255.00]  brand there's a there's a there's a coffee brand that wanted to get into into japan but yeah you know
[7255.00 --> 7260.52]  this story there's a coffee brand that wanted to get in japan and they worked with somebody or did some
[7260.52 --> 7264.12]  market research or something and found that nobody in japan likes coffee they just they all like tea
[7264.76 --> 7272.20]  um so they started introducing like kids candies and stuff that were coffee flavored so the kids would
[7272.20 --> 7277.16]  get used it was nestle nescafe i don't know it's someone uh the kids would get used to the flavor of
[7277.16 --> 7282.92]  coffee and then they kept doing stuff like that and now coffee is like an enormous industry in japan
[7283.48 --> 7289.08]  they got into japan not by convincing the the adults that it was good they got into japan by
[7289.96 --> 7297.88]  and nestle owns nescafe yeah okay that makes sense great um by doing yeah by like effectively
[7297.88 --> 7304.12]  advertising to children through getting them used to the flavor coffee psyop so so these little like
[7304.12 --> 7309.56]  well it's kind of gambling but it's not really and it's for kids is like definitely to get kids
[7309.56 --> 7315.32]  more into gambling when they're older that's for sure a thing that's one of the this whoo hot takes
[7315.32 --> 7322.52]  coming back to wanshow i'm excited this is the whole thing about why um i don't balk as hard
[7324.76 --> 7330.44]  at the nintendo game price increase because if i if i'm trying to think if i had kids and i had to give
[7330.44 --> 7336.04]  them a game i would much rather give them older games or games that don't have microtransactions
[7336.04 --> 7343.56]  in them i'm gonna dump some cold water on that there's literally gambling in pokemon blue yeah okay
[7344.92 --> 7347.32]  it helps that also like just lose
[7350.60 --> 7354.44]  also also i would say that the
[7356.84 --> 7357.56]  oh man
[7357.56 --> 7367.64]  is nintendo super gotcha i don't think so they'll milk you they'll sell you amiibos they'll sell you
[7367.64 --> 7372.20]  two copies of the literally going back to the game boy they would sell you pokemon blue and red and a
[7372.20 --> 7380.92]  link cable king of the milkers they'll milk you but they're not super gotcha apparently they have gotcha
[7380.92 --> 7386.92]  mobile games oh you can't you can't count on anybody you can't count on anybody these days
[7386.92 --> 7394.92]  dang that's sad that sucks but yeah i i mean i think there's value to trying to avoid these
[7394.92 --> 7402.36]  things but it is weird to me there is anti-gambling is like not that big of a thing anymore like
[7402.36 --> 7406.68]  everybody just gave up and it felt like everybody just gave up at like the same time it was weird
[7406.68 --> 7412.44]  i feel like twitch just like made it super mainstream you know what oh back to what you were saying about
[7412.44 --> 7417.80]  nescafe and the candies and stuff that's actually something that blew my mind about mcdonald's
[7417.80 --> 7425.32]  strategy like mcdonald's has been struggling they've been closing stores they broadly speaking i don't
[7425.32 --> 7428.60]  know if they like had a good quarter last quarter or whatever the worst rebrand in the world but they
[7428.60 --> 7436.36]  but they but they've basically as far as i can tell um lost their mojo back when i was making the
[7436.36 --> 7442.52]  transition to adulthood remember when they brought in they they got rid of the fun kid friend kid
[7442.52 --> 7448.68]  friendly restaurants with play places and they made them and they brought in mccafe with the like the
[7448.68 --> 7454.44]  green and the brown and they just tried to they tried to be starbucks and it's like and something
[7454.44 --> 7460.60]  that i've been trying to figure out for basically my entire adult life is what the hell were they
[7460.60 --> 7466.76]  thinking the only reason that anyone i knew ate mcdonald's was because they ate it as a kid
[7467.48 --> 7473.24]  and my kids don't even like mcdonald's but i will say that the occasional mcdonald's we went to when
[7473.24 --> 7478.92]  they were young and they still had more of the ones that had like the the play centers in them and stuff
[7478.92 --> 7485.80]  they enjoyed going there mcdonald's figured it out yeah like decades ago yeah that you just wanted to
[7485.80 --> 7491.96]  associate the flavor of mcdonald's with happy family memories and you'd be hooked for life and
[7491.96 --> 7498.92]  then they were just like you know what cartoon characters that appeal to kids no forget it adults
[7498.92 --> 7508.52]  have more money we should appeal to a dog guess who buys stuff for kids are you crazy anyway good luck
[7508.52 --> 7511.80]  mcdonald's truthfully i don't care about your success your food sucks
[7511.80 --> 7522.20]  and yes that is just conditioning so much of marketing maori in floatplane chat is just
[7522.20 --> 7531.80]  conditioning is it maori maori i don't know um shabham says mcdonald's is not a service company it's a
[7531.80 --> 7537.40]  real estate company yeah but i mean what's the machine that creates the the money to invest in real
[7537.40 --> 7542.28]  estate like you gotta you have to have an operating business all right
[7546.68 --> 7553.64]  should we talk about dbrand's kill switch to case controversy what does this say hold on oh what are you
[7553.64 --> 7565.48]  doing what am i looking at that's awesome this is sick is that current it seems like it
[7565.48 --> 7570.60]  it see like that's sweet well that's not inspiring but
[7574.12 --> 7580.52]  well yeah why why is fast food so much better in japan that's cool that's wild all right make
[7580.52 --> 7587.88]  mcdonald's cool again dbrand's kill switch 2 case has been under fire for having issues with joy cons
[7587.88 --> 7595.08]  detaching when pressure is applied dbrand responded on reddit with a lengthy post with a lot of focus on
[7595.08 --> 7600.28]  how the device is generally meant to be held uh-oh
[7603.56 --> 7607.96]  they outlined that the issue stemmed from some manufacturing tolerances in the case for the joy
[7607.96 --> 7616.36]  con controllers um and committed to dealing with any affected users but the takeaway from redditors who saw
[7616.36 --> 7624.36]  the post was you guys did not just you're holding it wrong us did you a couple days later dbrand
[7624.36 --> 7630.28]  issued a part two to their response they condensed their longer response down to just four points
[7630.28 --> 7635.72]  and acknowledged the shortcomings of their previous response dbrand provided us something to read
[7635.72 --> 7643.72]  we up them not us this time it's not it's not my controversy hashtag not my controversy
[7643.72 --> 7651.08]  it wasn't us not only did we up by not seeing this prior to shipping but we up by responding with
[7651.08 --> 7656.04]  4 000 words that could have effectively been boiled down to you're holding it wrong ultimately debating
[7656.04 --> 7660.28]  the right or wrong way to hold a console is besides the point customers should be able to hold this thing
[7660.28 --> 7665.56]  however they want without the joy cons detaching after reading the feedback it is clear that neither
[7665.56 --> 7670.84]  our response nor the conditional if you're affected solution was welcomed by the community
[7671.48 --> 7676.28]  since then our engineering team has dug deep to find alternative solutions come up with two and we
[7676.28 --> 7681.32]  have communicated this new plan everyone is getting a free replacement regardless of whether they're
[7681.32 --> 7685.56]  severely affected haven't experienced the issue have emailed us a dozen times or have no clue about any of
[7685.56 --> 7690.84]  this on july 10th we'll know which of the two proposed new joycon solutions is going to be viable
[7691.40 --> 7697.24]  one is mass producible and a real improvement over the current good but inconsistent version the
[7697.24 --> 7701.32]  other is borderline impossible to mass produce but we're going to try anyway because it will result
[7701.32 --> 7706.68]  in a joycon attachment that's truly flawless you can't say that and not do it that's so dangerous in
[7706.68 --> 7711.48]  the end we remain committed to candor responsiveness and when we something up making sure we own it and
[7711.48 --> 7723.08]  getting customers the right product you on the other hand remain short i like dbrand good stuff
[7724.92 --> 7730.76]  they're good stuff you know what else is good stuff i still remember before we had this level
[7730.76 --> 7736.44]  of relationship with them i remember one time at ces uh i had filmed so many videos and i was mentally
[7736.44 --> 7740.84]  cooked and i got to another dbrand sponsorship and i think it was my like fifth of the day or something
[7741.48 --> 7746.60]  uh so instead of saying the ad read i just said their name like 50 times
[7748.84 --> 7755.80]  and the next day i was like oh man i like probably shouldn't have done that and then they saw it and
[7755.80 --> 7768.44]  were like this is amazing and i was like whoa all right they're cool oh man lordy microsoft doesn't
[7768.44 --> 7774.84]  want another crowd strike incident and is kicking antivirus out of the kernel windows is making big
[7774.84 --> 7779.72]  changes to cyber security removing third-party security drivers from the kernel and running them
[7779.72 --> 7785.08]  instead in user space kernel space is the layer of the os with the most privileges allowing direct
[7785.08 --> 7790.12]  access to many hardware functions and resources and antivirus software typically likes to have kernel
[7790.12 --> 7794.20]  access because it provides the ability to handle almost any malicious threat that may have wiggled its
[7794.20 --> 7800.44]  way into your system the issue though is that kernel access can bring substantial stability issues
[7800.44 --> 7806.44]  a faulty update that was pushed was what caused the crowd strike meltdown that like actually impacted
[7806.44 --> 7813.00]  like world infrastructure was not good this is why security experts recommend that microsoft remove
[7813.00 --> 7818.84]  third-party driver access to the kernel so in july microsoft will be launching a private preview of new
[7818.84 --> 7824.12]  features as part of their windows resiliency initiative this announcement comes with quotes from a variety of
[7824.12 --> 7829.64]  security partners singing the praises of the move notably though none of these companies have
[7829.64 --> 7834.20]  actually committed to moving their drivers out of the kernel at this time it's worth noting that
[7834.20 --> 7840.28]  microsoft tried to do this back with windows vista but antivirus companies filed an antitrust complaint with
[7840.28 --> 7848.04]  the eu and microsoft backed down because it would have made it so only microsoft can handle kernel level
[7848.04 --> 7856.68]  security our discussion question then is what methods could microsoft be taking or what what steps could
[7856.68 --> 7862.20]  microsoft be taking to provide security software with the same abilities that they have without providing
[7862.20 --> 7865.72]  them kernel access and i got to confess i don't know enough about the inner workings of an operating
[7865.72 --> 7872.44]  system to even begin to speculate our other question is i don't know what does this mean for kernel-based
[7872.44 --> 7879.48]  anti-cheat software and therefore potentially the year of the linux desktop because that's a lot of
[7879.48 --> 7885.00]  the justification that i've heard for why they won't port their anti-cheat to linux is that they can't
[7885.00 --> 7888.84]  run at a kernel level and windows allows it so if neither of them allow it
[7891.00 --> 7893.48]  and if that's true what happens to cheating in video games
[7895.72 --> 7899.24]  so okay it sounds like you're ready to kind of both sides this a little bit
[7899.24 --> 7905.48]  you you clearly as someone who's security minded do not want anything mucking around with the
[7905.48 --> 7914.92]  kernel of your operating system yes however as a gamer who likes to not be um you know 360 no scoped
[7914.92 --> 7920.68]  through the map from the other side of a tarkov raid or whatever uh instance what are they even
[7920.68 --> 7929.32]  called no yes that was right raid nice good um terminology appreciate what can be achieved through
[7929.32 --> 7937.08]  kernel level monitoring of what's going on on a system or in many cases not achieved but is there
[7937.08 --> 7941.08]  a better than nothing argument to be made here i think we can't just give up on everything just for
[7941.08 --> 7948.28]  the sake of gaming um i also think that if we really do want to get away from you can never completely
[7948.28 --> 7954.12]  get away from it but if we want to try to get away from the incredibly rampant level that cheating in
[7954.12 --> 7960.28]  video games is currently at like literally by far worse than ever um and there's a lot of evidence
[7960.28 --> 7970.12]  for this uh i think we're gonna have to funny enough with the consoles like kind of exiting the world right
[7970.12 --> 7977.16]  now i feel like we almost need to go back to console like devices i've said this on when show before it
[7977.16 --> 7981.40]  was a hot take back then i still have it now i think you're gonna have to have something that's
[7981.40 --> 7990.04]  really locked down and it has these types of like kernel level totally taken over uh but i i would want
[7990.04 --> 7997.08]  it separate from my pc because i wouldn't want that level of um secured uh other people's security stuff
[7997.96 --> 8006.60]  on my pc or maybe it's a setup that you can do on your own computer i'll tell you what's a setup
[8006.60 --> 8013.24]  you setting me up for our next topic okay announcements went up last week from xbox
[8013.24 --> 8019.80]  president sarah bond and amd chair and ceo dr lisa sue about amd and xbox's renewed partnership to
[8019.80 --> 8026.04]  co-engineer silicon for new xbox hardware this isn't that big of a surprise amd worked with microsoft
[8026.04 --> 8031.88]  all the way back on the xbox 360 as ati at the time for the gpu and then provided a custom apu for
[8031.88 --> 8039.24]  the xbox one and series lineups it does however solidify the direction that the xbox is taking for
[8039.24 --> 8047.56]  their hardware bond speaks about xbox being a lineup across console handheld pc cloud and accessories
[8047.56 --> 8051.64]  with both leaders emphasizing that backwards compatibility is a priority so you can continue
[8051.64 --> 8057.96]  to play your old games on new hardware so does that change anything about what you said where it
[8057.96 --> 8065.72]  seems like amd and microsoft are coming out and saying hey xbox consoles are not going anywhere
[8066.60 --> 8073.72]  and does that potentially validate sort of your take that there's going to be the pc gaming experience
[8073.72 --> 8077.56]  which is going to just come with all the problems of not being able to have kernel level security
[8077.56 --> 8085.48]  hardware level security and would you consider an xbox console if it offered a more pc-like experience
[8085.48 --> 8092.76]  experience except that it was just games and locked the crap down yeah the one of the problems there is there's
[8092.76 --> 8096.20]  absolutely cheaters on console and like has been
[8098.28 --> 8106.68]  forever i do think the barrier at least right now i would say is higher because than pc pc cheating on pc is
[8106.68 --> 8116.52]  literally like advertised in banner ads on youtube like cheating on pc doesn't require anything anymore
[8116.52 --> 8121.88]  when i was a kid it was like you had to at least be like kind of script kitty level yeah but you could
[8121.88 --> 8127.32]  do it and it really wasn't that hard yeah um it was mostly like you had to be script kitty level for the
[8127.32 --> 8134.20]  awareness more than anything not the actual ability um to not like nuke your computer in the process and to
[8134.20 --> 8139.88]  even like know what to look for and stuff like that um now it's like advertised to you and it's like
[8139.88 --> 8146.44]  white glove service and you pay like subscription models for the good ones and like if you pay enough
[8146.44 --> 8152.28]  there's people that will custom make one specifically for you to help you from getting banned like it is
[8152.28 --> 8161.08]  it is a multi many many many billions of dollars industry billions are you sure yep billions it's bad with
[8161.08 --> 8168.52]  a b i'm pretty darn sure it's huge there's people that play subscriptions for cheats for games that are many hundreds of
[8168.52 --> 8171.16]  dollars and those are not the custom tailored ones
[8173.48 --> 8176.28]  there's like it's a it's a huge deal
[8178.20 --> 8187.40]  there is a lot of really lame losers it's crazy luke wisdom tips it's crazy how how many trash people there are it's
[8187.40 --> 8193.16]  it's actually wild um wow parallelogram in float plane chat says people be paying
[8193.16 --> 8198.60]  twenty dollars a day for cheats that i know of there's there's weekend passes
[8200.44 --> 8202.60]  like it's it's wild
[8204.52 --> 8210.04]  is this a big part of what's driving how difficult it is to jump into a lobby and play online now
[8210.04 --> 8213.72]  in my opinion are there just so many cheaters there is an incredible amount
[8213.72 --> 8218.68]  like that that tarkov thing where they were like there's kind of at least one in every lobby
[8219.80 --> 8223.56]  after that i started trying to look around i was like is this really a tarkov issue no
[8225.24 --> 8232.92]  it's everywhere i do think tarkov could do way more okay that's it's not quite the same thing yeah but
[8232.92 --> 8240.12]  that's still a lot um i i believe tarkov could do a lot more they could adding replays would be huge and
[8240.12 --> 8245.00]  they're not doing it and i i honestly think it's because people would see how bad the situation is
[8245.00 --> 8249.80]  um they have replays in arena they absolutely have the technology they could do it and they're just
[8249.80 --> 8257.88]  not doing it um tarkov is worse than when that video came out that's really debatable and extremely
[8257.88 --> 8262.68]  difficult to measure but my point is that it's everywhere this is not just a tarkov issue the problem
[8262.68 --> 8267.72]  is that the impact of it is extremely high in tarkov but it is it is literally ever there's cheaters in rocket
[8267.72 --> 8277.08]  league how do you wouldn't it be so obvious i guess i guess not like if you just what like driving
[8277.08 --> 8282.60]  assists or like there's things like you can get the ball up on your hood and then you can kind of like
[8282.60 --> 8288.20]  dribble it by keeping it on your car and there's there's cheats that can yeah somebody just said
[8288.20 --> 8294.28]  dribble scripts yeah exactly there's cheats that can do that like car shake for you so you would just
[8294.28 --> 8302.36]  drive normally and it would keep the ball on your hood for you um i i believe there's other stuff
[8302.36 --> 8306.20]  as well but that's the only one i know of because uh sunless con had a video on it recently
[8308.28 --> 8314.52]  it's it's uh it's everywhere there are cheaters in warzone casual yeah they're not even necessarily
[8314.52 --> 8320.36]  playing competitive modes like it's it's everywhere if you're playing multiplayer games these days that
[8320.36 --> 8327.48]  are competitive you're playing with cheaters oh but but i have good news this monday i attended
[8328.44 --> 8331.08]  a meeting oh at surrey city hall
[8333.72 --> 8339.24]  i don't know where this is going it was the second reading of our temporary use permit for whale land
[8339.24 --> 8349.16]  and we're good to go oh really i i got kind of the idea based on your body language but it's nice to
[8349.16 --> 8355.88]  hear it officially we're in we're in that's fantastic surrey is down to clown and i don't know if i'm
[8355.88 --> 8361.72]  supposed to announce it yet but the first whale land i have a date and it will be before the end of
[8361.72 --> 8367.16]  this year so chase is chase oh wait i i announced this i actually talked about this on the live
[8367.16 --> 8371.48]  stream yesterday that we did but a lot of you probably didn't watch that um chase is literally
[8371.48 --> 8378.44]  working on it now now right now well okay not now but a few hours ago he was when before he left the
[8378.44 --> 8386.68]  office too bad he can't get away from cheating at lance what we can i think we i think that i think that
[8386.68 --> 8395.32]  when the consequences are literally being escorted out of the building um i don't i don't really think
[8395.32 --> 8400.36]  that's happened at one of our lands to be honest give us time it's very possible i would do it no no
[8400.36 --> 8408.52]  no you know i'd do it i don't mean that oh you mean cheating yeah if we if we catch you you will never
[8409.16 --> 8413.08]  set foot at a whale land again could we could we have it in the thing that it's like name and shame
[8413.08 --> 8419.16]  i would just do it i don't care who cares i mean we'll have like we'll have what we'll have filming
[8419.16 --> 8424.12]  notices as part of like whale land like you will consent to your likeness etc when show banner of
[8424.12 --> 8430.84]  shame yeah i can't just rotation for all time no no because people want notoriety no they wouldn't
[8430.84 --> 8436.76]  get that absolutely not linus is more experienced at this yeah no no no no no no no no but they would
[8436.76 --> 8445.00]  absolutely be shamed in person oh yeah and it'd be awful oh because like i don't like you yeah like
[8445.00 --> 8451.40]  it's that simple man yeah not cool yeah not cool yeah this is a friendly event we're all we're all
[8451.40 --> 8457.72]  friends here you don't do that there's just there's so many examples of streamers getting caught cheating
[8459.24 --> 8464.76]  there's so many examples of people getting caught cheating at major tournaments by having cheats like
[8464.76 --> 8469.24]  built into the tiny amount of memory on their mouse or whatever else like just all these different
[8469.24 --> 8478.20]  ways it's uh it's it's rough out there so if there was a thing that offered at least a solid amount of
[8478.20 --> 8485.64]  reprieve like i'm not i'm not expecting literally anything to solve it at all but if there's something
[8485.64 --> 8492.68]  that added a a good amount of reprieve i would i would go for it um last thing here is that um
[8492.68 --> 8498.84]  um xbox president president sarah bond also spoke about working closely with the windows team to
[8498.84 --> 8504.92]  ensure that windows is the number one platform for gaming and not locked to a single store i think
[8504.92 --> 8511.72]  we've talked a little bit about this when we spoke about the um the xbox and rog ally collaboration
[8511.72 --> 8519.00]  product but it's very clear the direction that microsoft wants to go with you know xbox is any screen in
[8519.00 --> 8525.64]  your home uh be it windows or running xbox operating system or running tyson os or whatever the case may be
[8526.92 --> 8535.56]  that's their vision uh this is cool an asus rtx 5090 back to front card connector seems to be able to do up
[8535.56 --> 8545.56]  to 1900 watts without burning up tony you asus asus china's gm showcased exactly what you can do with a
[8545.56 --> 8555.16]  different peculiar power connector like the gc hpwr connector on the rog astral 5090 btf so you can
[8555.16 --> 8561.88]  actually if you want to show your mouse on the uh the power connector there um this new btf card design
[8561.88 --> 8569.88]  has a detachable gc hpwr allowing you to choose between it and a standard 12 volt high power connector
[8569.88 --> 8575.08]  or 12 volt 2x6 i think is what we meant to put in the script that's really cool it allows you to use the
[8575.08 --> 8581.96]  card with a btf motherboard if you have one but also retain your resale value for the person who likely
[8581.96 --> 8585.08]  won't have a btf motherboard who you want to like sell it to when you're ready to upgrade
[8585.80 --> 8591.40]  the gchpwr connector was designed to handle a thousand watts but you used a chroma load tester
[8591.40 --> 8597.40]  with the connector at a constant 670 watts plenty to uh to power a standard rtx 5090 with it staying
[8597.40 --> 8604.84]  between 30 and 35 degrees celsius he pushed it to 1300 watts which saw it increase to 38 degrees celsius
[8604.84 --> 8611.16]  still very comfortable and as an extreme the chroma was turned up to 1900 watts with the connector staying
[8611.16 --> 8621.72]  around 41 degrees celsius which is not bad not bad at all here we go here come the amps bring on the amps
[8621.72 --> 8625.96]  oh i forgot his name but i've met him
[8629.08 --> 8631.32]  1900 watts
[8632.92 --> 8639.16]  gorgeous great work btf just needs to be a thing uh discussion question is cool but i wouldn't want
[8639.16 --> 8645.48]  that much power running through my motherboard which is fair enough i mean it's dc so like the level like
[8645.48 --> 8651.40]  i i don't design pcbs for a living but my understanding is that that would be less likely
[8651.40 --> 8659.08]  to cause interference than um ac obviously but does just running that kind of power through your
[8659.08 --> 8666.36]  motherboard if you have enough um if you have enough isolation between your power plane and your data
[8666.36 --> 8671.08]  planes or man it would depend kind of where it's coming from where it's going to would that be the
[8671.08 --> 8677.00]  end of the world maybe not i don't know nothing about it cat o acid usually fine i wonder if they
[8677.00 --> 8681.80]  just had a hole and you could just what we really need the cable through what we really need to do is
[8681.80 --> 8686.60]  just like i can't believe that we've gone through so many iterations of updating the standard to like
[8686.60 --> 8691.40]  needing new connectors and basically needing to replace this stuff and we haven't increased the voltage
[8691.40 --> 8697.16]  tynan said it's fine but it might get toasty yeah which is not fine well it can be fine
[8697.16 --> 8701.40]  i like toast
[8703.56 --> 8709.80]  finally xbox app merging all game launchers question mark recently users in the insiders
[8709.80 --> 8714.76]  update program for windows saw an update to the xbox app this update included combining other
[8714.76 --> 8719.72]  storefronts battle net game pass steam into the same launcher in an attempt to improve the user experience
[8719.72 --> 8725.48]  ah yes the proliferation of standards users will also be able to see the different launcher options
[8725.48 --> 8729.80]  in the xbox app so they know if they are launching a game from steam or another platform
[8729.80 --> 8734.28]  steam is the first and only storefront they have right now but microsoft confirms this is just the
[8734.28 --> 8739.40]  beginning hoping to add many launchers to the app though no promise that you won't need to install
[8739.40 --> 8744.36]  those dedicated launchers still for the game to open yeah you definitely will discussion question
[8744.36 --> 8747.96]  do you prefer one store that tries to combine launchers or several launchers that are consistent
[8747.96 --> 8753.08]  with themselves and are clearer about where you are um i just want everything to run on steam
[8753.08 --> 8760.84]  if you uh oh if it didn't require the launchers you could have already done it through steam and
[8760.84 --> 8765.48]  you've been able to do it that way through steam i don't want to say forever because that's not true
[8765.48 --> 8772.20]  but for a very long time yeah um and like i i like when i buy a game on steam and it's like an origin game
[8772.20 --> 8776.76]  but i open the game and it just like shows a quick origin thing and then it like goes away and then steam is
[8776.76 --> 8781.72]  just there and the game is there and then i close it and it's like origin something i don't know bye
[8781.72 --> 8787.72]  forget it and i go back to big picture is it even still called origin i don't know who cares me i
[8787.72 --> 8797.56]  don't need to know yeah cool linus aren't we against monopolies asks m9 and g27 i love steam but
[8797.56 --> 8804.84]  we are against monopolies but valve is not a monopoly yeah not at all actually valve has real competition
[8804.84 --> 8813.00]  they're just clearly the best one yes good luck tim sweeney to the sweeney copter
[8815.16 --> 8816.12]  epic games
[8816.12 --> 8828.04]  oh my goodness okay yeah yeah house fresh is done this one is hey now be nice to tim sweeney says
[8828.84 --> 8834.36]  i think he'll be all right i don't think tim sweeney cares what i think no are we done all who got mad
[8834.36 --> 8839.88]  when he said something wrong at one point that was him no no no no no no well okay yes well the
[8839.88 --> 8845.96]  playstation that was him though yeah well so he cares yeah yeah i was just i was being nice i just
[8845.96 --> 8853.32]  clarifying i was i was just being nice i was i was being nice okay i'm i'm nice what yeah he's a
[8853.32 --> 8857.64]  juggalo of course i'm nice everybody likes me
[8861.48 --> 8863.48]  or they're wrong yeah
[8866.60 --> 8871.16]  all right hit me up dan is it time for after dark i think by the way if you didn't migrate from
[8871.16 --> 8878.76]  origin to ea app you lose stuff it's probably fine lose what yeah lose my copy of battlefield 2
[8879.48 --> 8884.76]  i'm talking about the story on wanshow about how i used to share my origin account yes with the russian
[8884.76 --> 8886.92]  hacker guy well that's sweet of you
[8890.20 --> 8894.92]  i'm gonna download the ea app right now and i'm gonna log into it to see if i even still have an
[8894.92 --> 8902.04]  account there you get threat lockered so i used to yeah some definitely russian dude
[8903.16 --> 8908.60]  he used to he would steal my origin account and play games um but i like didn't really care because
[8908.60 --> 8913.80]  i very rarely used it oh i can't install it because i'm getting in there right now i'm getting in there
[8913.80 --> 8919.88]  right now i can't install the thing just give me two seconds please request admin i was already
[8919.88 --> 8925.00]  logging in did you press the button request admin you mean login as administrator no i don't
[8925.00 --> 8933.00]  i don't even know what it is send request as fast as i can it's a good thing it's a good thing
[8933.00 --> 8937.40]  the threat locker is installed on my work machine that is a good thing it's not installed on all
[8937.40 --> 8944.44]  your work machines anymore you shouldn't tell the people that now i'm an attack well no it is
[8944.44 --> 8948.12]  technically it is now look what you've done installed and i'm not i'm not actually pulling
[8948.12 --> 8956.44]  that back it is installed okay so much for being c-suite linus i mean c-suites can be hacked if
[8956.44 --> 8963.00]  anything they're the best targets get to do some of that whaling yeah uh but yeah i he would take my
[8963.00 --> 8968.04]  account and i wouldn't care and then many months later i would suddenly care except to play something
[8968.04 --> 8973.56]  and i i still he had the password i had the secret question so instead of resetting the password i would
[8973.56 --> 8977.56]  just log you were able to log in with the secret question somehow or something i don't remember exactly
[8977.56 --> 8983.80]  what um so i would get in and play my game for a while and he would he would leave me alone for
[8983.80 --> 8989.32]  like a while and then uh i guess he just checked like a month later or something and then he would
[8989.32 --> 8995.64]  take it back and keep playing and i just i thought it was funny so i just never fixed the problem um i
[8995.64 --> 8999.48]  don't remember all the details but it's something like that and uh i remember you telling me about this
[8999.48 --> 9005.56]  this is back in like the langley house days yeah this is a long time ago uh and he he added games to the
[9005.56 --> 9013.00]  account so there's like football manager and like all this other random stuff i was like what are you
[9013.00 --> 9020.36]  doing like why why would you do that on my account but then i just still never cared um i think
[9020.36 --> 9025.48]  eventually i was trying to play something and he kept booting me out over and over again so i was like
[9025.48 --> 9034.04]  all right we're done now and i i officially finally fixed it but did it start installing oh you can now run
[9034.04 --> 9039.88]  this application run now all right let's see it was fun for a while see if we can do this maybe he
[9039.88 --> 9047.64]  has your reddit credentials it's just being kind online that's a that's a sick that's a good reference
[9050.60 --> 9055.48]  anyway we can move on to our next thing for now we don't have one yeah just merge messages it's
[9055.48 --> 9060.92]  after dark let's go yeah that's what i meant that's what i meant should we do super dark mode
[9061.48 --> 9069.48]  because of the glow sure oh i won't see anything we see it for a second we can see it for a second
[9069.48 --> 9075.00]  okay okay give me one sec this physical button i can do it no no dan dan's got the control but is
[9075.00 --> 9081.24]  he no he's actually he's producer dan yeah how dare you disrespect him like that he's not glowing oh these
[9081.24 --> 9089.48]  jesus jesus you're needy yeah doing it for the audience oh what's that light down that one
[9093.32 --> 9098.20]  it's not going to have any glow left by the time we actually get it yeah oh windows cannot access
[9098.20 --> 9105.16]  the specified device path or file where is he going i can't install ea app
[9105.16 --> 9114.20]  oh he's cooking let him cook oh launch the app what what the it says it's already installed now
[9115.08 --> 9120.92]  i don't think i can launch it seems like a you problem you seem like a me problem sometimes got him
[9126.12 --> 9132.12]  oh hold on oh yeah no no she's working look she's working she's cooking there we go
[9135.16 --> 9144.84]  okay keep me signed in okay you just you know that my what my username yeah yeah why would i not know
[9144.84 --> 9153.16]  my username it's just my email oh okay fair enough i don't know my my username for for origin but i guess
[9153.16 --> 9159.08]  it's just my email it's probably fine i think it's this one yeah it's too late yeah it's too late we we
[9159.08 --> 9164.28]  can't see our glowing table anymore because it's not charged anymore also i don't think it's dark enough
[9164.28 --> 9171.00]  maybe the purple light is the problem yeah the purple is the problem oh but they can't see yeah
[9171.00 --> 9175.08]  no yeah i can see it glowing but they definitely can't see that we could turn the lights back on
[9175.08 --> 9180.84]  i think they can kind of see it this has gotten awkward at this point they can see me i mean yeah
[9180.84 --> 9186.76]  here why am i visible and not you uh maybe you're whiter than me oh you have a white screen on your
[9186.76 --> 9194.20]  computer oh so if we goodbye yeah there you go yeah yeah okay okay there you go okay they can see it
[9194.20 --> 9200.76]  now nice our rap partner d brand who by the way also makes the glow in the dark skin for my phone and
[9200.76 --> 9207.00]  also not glow the dark skin yeah uh this is our glow this is our glow circuit skin and it's all over
[9207.00 --> 9214.92]  the table okay thank you it's probably that was wonderful well that was worth yeah that i well debatable
[9214.92 --> 9221.80]  but sure yeah i know it was what you think they didn't enjoy it all right well i don't know it's
[9221.80 --> 9227.96]  like the whole point of the show is it though for them to enjoy is it though yeah okay when show after
[9227.96 --> 9234.68]  dark here we go here's the games that time to flashbang them here's the games that i own on ea app
[9234.68 --> 9245.88]  oh ouch i have free to play games apex legends and the sims 4 nice i think oh no add to your library
[9245.88 --> 9254.52]  so i don't have these i guess okay my library includes such hits as battlefield 3 nice battlefield
[9254.52 --> 9264.44]  bad company 2 nice so you you stopped playing battlefields at the correct time i never played
[9264.44 --> 9269.96]  battlefield this is for benchmarking oh that makes sense benchmarking battlefield at the right time
[9269.96 --> 9277.40]  yeah crusader no remorse a game that i have been meaning to play since i was like nine uh crisis 3
[9278.44 --> 9283.88]  dragon age inquisition it takes two which i actually own through steam whatever this is
[9283.88 --> 9290.36]  nox dude nox is uh nox is sick super old school rpg plants versus zombies garden wars 2 which i only
[9290.36 --> 9295.96]  own because of a make-a-wish um thing where they wanted to play this and i was like okay i'll bite
[9295.96 --> 9301.32]  i'll buy this game surprisingly good yeah it's actually pretty fun uh battlefront titanfall 2 which is
[9301.32 --> 9305.80]  because of you but also just through steam and unravel 2 which i actually just played uh with my wife
[9306.36 --> 9313.64]  and we enjoyed it it was fine yeah yeah the story was i didn't really understand but um apparently not
[9313.64 --> 9321.24]  not supposed to yeah so that's cool okay hit me dan sure i've got a few here hello winus wook and
[9321.24 --> 9327.88]  when linus have you seen the live action version yet and what are your thoughts live what the live
[9327.88 --> 9335.16]  action version not yet i'm so i'm like actually i'm actively stressed about seeing it the live show
[9335.16 --> 9343.16]  how to train your dragon one is the perfect movie it is better than any other movie except maybe the
[9343.16 --> 9350.36]  incredibles and i don't know there's plenty of movies i love but how to train your dragon one is a
[9350.36 --> 9359.64]  perfect movie um chat says it seems pretty good uh elijah said it was pretty mid i don't know man i don't know
[9359.64 --> 9370.04]  um you loved it okay that's something um but why do live action see that's the question it was
[9370.04 --> 9375.88]  already perfect i would have rather they just did like a remaster with new textures and hdr lighting
[9376.52 --> 9382.28]  you know i agree i don't like live action remakes they're not even live action
[9382.28 --> 9390.84]  like that's the thing the main character is still cgi i was seriously wronged with the release of
[9390.84 --> 9398.60]  the warcraft movie that was a crime against me in particular and then all of hollywood decided that
[9398.60 --> 9405.64]  they were going to release worse versions of childhood classics by taking one of the most charming
[9405.64 --> 9411.72]  aspects about them and making them quote unquote live action okay living in chat is that reese
[9413.24 --> 9421.64]  oh is living reese no uh reese's uh dirt wizard hold on living is uh is um pancrats that's right
[9421.64 --> 9426.76]  okay if i thought i thought it was reese and i was going to be like okay because reese and i are pretty
[9426.76 --> 9432.68]  aligned on movie taste so far from from what i've seen so far uh he agrees the breakfast club is actual
[9433.40 --> 9441.96]  unmitigated disaster um based but living um pancrats you i don't know how aligned we are on movie taste
[9441.96 --> 9449.08]  yet i'm not saying your taste is bad i'm just saying that maybe i do i just don't know yet i don't know
[9449.08 --> 9454.36]  yet make sure that you're agreeing with the narcissist or you might lose your job oh stop
[9455.48 --> 9463.80]  speaking of which speaking of which movie night last friday yeah what'd you guys think last action hero it
[9463.80 --> 9469.88]  was very good i was way more surprised than i was expecting to be i actually wasn't surprised and
[9469.88 --> 9475.32]  i enjoyed it a lot yeah i know that was uh that was sick uh binky draws says the dungeon dragons movie
[9475.32 --> 9480.04]  was awesome though and i agree it was very good actually really deserves a lot more than it got and
[9480.04 --> 9484.52]  i'm very sad that people didn't realize how good that movie was because it might not get another one
[9484.52 --> 9490.68]  and that would be very it wasn't super super polished but it was exactly what it was supposed
[9490.68 --> 9497.56]  to be yes it was so self-aware yeah it was great and it was self-aware very appropriately because it
[9497.56 --> 9501.72]  was still a good story still a good character yes despite being self-aware and that's what i love
[9501.72 --> 9507.32]  about last action hero what was the other movie exactly what it's doing the other one you were
[9507.32 --> 9513.48]  talking about the soldiers dragons oh yeah yeah no that was that was very good so last action hero is
[9513.48 --> 9522.84]  both an action movie and also a spoof of everything that made especially 80s action movies kind of
[9522.84 --> 9529.96]  cringeworthy and unbearable so it does it does everything that they do to the nth degree while
[9529.96 --> 9539.08]  also straight-faced being an action movie i love it and i hadn't even remembered the like celebrity
[9539.08 --> 9546.92]  cameos at the end it had everybody it had bill freaking murray in it dude this the scene when
[9546.92 --> 9552.60]  maria shriver like gives arnold schwarzenegger like arnold schwarzenegger the actor playing himself
[9552.60 --> 9558.28]  instead of arnold schwarzenegger playing the like the action hero guy she like gives him crap about
[9558.28 --> 9564.20]  talking about promoting his stupid restaurants on the red carpet like oh it's so many it's so good it was
[9564.20 --> 9574.60]  really good it was fantastic i enjoyed it a lot um anywho more yeah so i will see how to train your
[9574.60 --> 9580.44]  dragon but i'll probably i don't think i'm gonna bother in the theater i think i'll wait and i'll
[9580.44 --> 9586.44]  watch it in my theater at home watch on your phone just to give it an extra little no that's like a
[9586.44 --> 9591.96]  guarantee you're making you're making it lose yeah i did that i did that with gladiator 2 i watched it
[9591.96 --> 9596.04]  on a plane on purpose and i was like just to disrespect it i'm not gonna like this and then i
[9596.04 --> 9601.40]  like hate watched the whole thing and got to the end was just mad yeah i watched that at home and was
[9601.96 --> 9609.72]  incredibly upset i loved gladiator 1 so much and it was an incredible disaster bimmy zoon town says
[9609.72 --> 9619.40]  load it on an ipod video and watch it there yeah yeah kindle yikes okay hey lld would you consider
[9619.40 --> 9624.04]  doing other transparent products such as a transparent backpack for security checks and
[9624.04 --> 9631.00]  how long does it take to prototype the transparent driver uh three years so we're interested in other
[9631.00 --> 9636.28]  transparent products but i can pretty much promise you that we're not making prises raincoat from
[9636.84 --> 9644.76]  blade runner um as in backpack form um i just i i can't think of a material that would be
[9644.76 --> 9654.60]  clear enough to really see through but also um robust enough for us to be confident making a backpack with
[9654.60 --> 9654.76]  it
[9656.76 --> 9663.96]  so triton well it's it's rigid though yeah would you really want a rigid backpack plenty of them
[9663.96 --> 9668.44]  that you put cats in them they're like they're like they're all domes they are a thing
[9672.68 --> 9678.52]  isn't isn't that like isn't that fjallraven backpack fairly rigid and that was like incredibly popular
[9678.52 --> 9684.76]  for many years oh hi josh says you literally ride a motorcycle okay all right all right all right all
[9684.76 --> 9689.08]  right all right all right okay it's not because you can strap a luggage to your back if you really want to but
[9689.08 --> 9697.48]  i i we have so much work to do you know continuing to innovate in like soft goods backpacks that i
[9697.48 --> 9703.64]  don't know that i'm ready to just completely change gears and go into an entirely new product category
[9703.64 --> 9712.60]  so no promises no promises for for now oh fray says do you know why last action hero was a flop
[9712.60 --> 9721.24]  it opened the same week as jurassic park oh my god that makes so much more sense because we were
[9721.24 --> 9726.84]  talking about this after it did make money yeah but barely barely and when you look like nobody
[9726.84 --> 9732.68]  remembers it yeah it was an 80 million dollar budget for a movie that did like what was it like 150 mil
[9732.68 --> 9740.44]  total and jurassic park was like groundbreaking yeah from special effects and artistry and just
[9740.44 --> 9747.08]  so good apparently the marketing was also just a total disaster as well pancratz said it's just
[9747.08 --> 9753.56]  like titanfall 2 in that oh man oh no don't think everyone saw me go through that no that's funny oh no
[9755.64 --> 9761.56]  oh no hey i played it i bought it i played it titanfall 2 was great the single player is actually
[9761.56 --> 9768.44]  outstanding oh best single player shooter i've played since i was a wee child my biggest complaint is
[9768.44 --> 9774.76]  that you don't get to enjoy the super amazing cool fun gimmicks for long enough but that's one of the
[9774.76 --> 9781.08]  reasons why it's so good leave them wanting more yeah if all of it's perfect yeah it'll always be perfect
[9782.68 --> 9788.36]  how is your home assistant integrations going would love to know what works well and what doesn't
[9788.36 --> 9796.20]  what's that one automation that you can't live without not gonna lie jake and i were brainstorming um
[9797.16 --> 9806.52]  a way to make fixing my house into content today and we came up with a list of all the stuff about
[9806.52 --> 9811.16]  my smart house that's just kind of stupid and doesn't work or was poorly designed or implemented
[9811.16 --> 9815.88]  in the first place or we just never really finished because we got the video done got it to like minimum
[9815.88 --> 9821.00]  viable product works as a demo point and then just left it there um so i think it's actually going to be
[9821.00 --> 9828.36]  a series video one will be us going through and going oh yeah that what's what's rough yeah current
[9828.36 --> 9833.64]  state and then we're gonna we're gonna go like full automotive channel style and we're just gonna have
[9833.64 --> 9838.04]  a piece of cardboard that we're gonna write all the problems on and then over the series of a bunch of
[9838.04 --> 9842.76]  videos going forward we're gonna cross them out cool i like that yeah that sounds cool that's a
[9842.76 --> 9850.76]  great idea we stopped doing series and like multi-part content oh this is interesting do more
[9850.76 --> 9858.92]  p-ball-y p-ball-y p-ball says fun fact the animated anastasia movie did worse because disney re-released
[9858.92 --> 9863.64]  the little mermaid in theaters at the same time i wouldn't put it i wouldn't put it above disney to
[9863.64 --> 9868.28]  pull a move like that i don't know if that's true that's allegedly but i i i wouldn't put that past
[9868.28 --> 9877.48]  disney my lady ruined her own proposal should i redo it if so should i choose a new location
[9879.72 --> 9885.64]  if it's ruined you should redo it as someone whose proposal was ruined not by the lady but by myself
[9886.44 --> 9892.44]  i can tell you from experience that you will never hear the end of it you might not hear about it often
[9893.08 --> 9897.80]  and it might be in good humor you know mostly
[9900.60 --> 9906.92]  but she will remember it for better for worse in sickness and in health till death do you part
[9907.96 --> 9917.48]  so yeah i'd probably redo it if i were you if i were you cheers guys loved the video on mbx mark ii for
[9917.48 --> 9925.08]  your home systems how often do you find both change cases as part of an upgrade new builds versus
[9925.08 --> 9930.76]  reusing or favorite sentimental cases sorry this is a little self it's this is a little hard to parse
[9931.64 --> 9937.00]  how often do you change your case there you upgrade versus reusing a favorite or sentimental case
[9938.36 --> 9945.80]  my situation is not really fair for this um i have kept the case
[9947.48 --> 9954.60]  yeah i've advised a lot of other people to keep their cases and in builds that i've kind of like
[9954.60 --> 9956.52]  worked on um
[9956.52 --> 9967.48]  i've kept the case for me it's like not really fair because of our deal that seems to come with cases
[9967.48 --> 9974.52]  yeah he gets new computers in perpetuity i guess yeah it doesn't say how often you offered it i could
[9974.52 --> 9984.04]  i could i could do nothing no there is 45 years there is part of the clause is there how often do i have to do it it's it's not a timing thing but it's a keeping it in pace with yours
[9984.04 --> 9991.16]  really yeah it's not supposed to be the same you were just that narcissistic back then
[9994.60 --> 10000.20]  but it's supposed to be like you know reasonably within range that makes sense i don't remember the
[10000.20 --> 10007.32]  exact wording that checks out something what do you have now 40 40 80 oh you're good then i'm not
[10007.32 --> 10011.72]  complaining i think you have a better computer than me right now then maybe yeah i have a oh
[10012.36 --> 10018.60]  7900 xtx probably about about on par pretty darn close pretty similar yeah yours is better in ray
[10018.60 --> 10025.24]  tracing which i don't think you use anyway so cool um yeah yeah yeah not complaining not complaining as
[10025.24 --> 10034.52]  for me i i have changed my case very few times i had an antech land boy that was my first custom
[10034.52 --> 10041.88]  computer case with the smart blue 350 watt power supply so that's what i had i upgraded that to an
[10041.88 --> 10051.48]  anantec p160 i got the an ncix didn't carry the p160w but they did carry the windowed side panel
[10051.48 --> 10057.72]  replacement so i had an extra non-windowed side panel it was a really cool windowed side panel um instead of
[10057.72 --> 10067.64]  being flat uh it had these like i don't know these like ovals in it here we go um i don't know they
[10067.64 --> 10073.72]  were just they were kind of cool they were like stylish oh yeah indent things and and like the locks
[10073.72 --> 10079.48]  for the side panel were indented into it so you couldn't just like put a window on the regular case
[10079.48 --> 10083.72]  you had to oh you had to get the you had to get the stock window it looked it looked really sick
[10083.72 --> 10090.36]  um so i had one of these i actually i swapped out the led color in the front so mine instead of
[10090.36 --> 10095.64]  having blue leds uh lighting up these little front mirrored bits i swapped them out for green
[10095.64 --> 10103.08]  i had a cool amd inside uv reactive logo in the bottom i rattle can sprayed the inside black
[10103.80 --> 10111.88]  um what other modifications i had a i had a fan controller um in the front i think that's i think
[10111.88 --> 10118.76]  that's most of it i had oh i had a cool uh uv green transparent acrylic cover for my power supply
[10118.76 --> 10124.52]  and then i had uv green sleeving for my power supply back when i had this build anyway from there
[10125.88 --> 10132.60]  from there i think i went to the i think i went straight to the tj07 yvonne bought that for me
[10133.24 --> 10138.28]  that's that's how you know she's a keeper she gets you like a sick computer case and then i still have
[10138.28 --> 10142.76]  that i kind of still want to do a build in it one of these days and doing that unboxing of the murder
[10142.76 --> 10148.84]  box uh made me want to do it even more yeah it was a thing i was walking through the lab and was like
[10150.28 --> 10156.04]  three pallets of murder boxes i mean mbx2 or whatever whatever they ended up calling them
[10157.08 --> 10162.84]  they're they're the tj07 but refined perfected you might say and then from my tj07 i went to my rack
[10162.84 --> 10170.52]  mount case which i have like for a for like tech influencer or whatever i have kept for an awfully
[10170.52 --> 10177.64]  long time without making anything other than like slight quality of life modifications to i i love it
[10177.64 --> 10181.72]  it's perfect my computer sits in my rack i never look at it or think about it other than when it's broken
[10183.16 --> 10188.36]  and maybe that's i don't know maybe that's kind of lame i do want to do a really nice build for the
[10188.36 --> 10197.56]  theater room you need something for the theater room um and i want it to be like dead quiet like
[10197.56 --> 10208.20]  yeah silent yes maybe even silent and deadly oh yes one thing i i kind of button is a power button
[10208.20 --> 10216.12]  the other button ejects a knife i mean why a knife you can only kill one person with a knife if it
[10216.12 --> 10222.52]  ejected a grenade that was sort of true okay then the knife has mustard gas in the handle
[10224.92 --> 10231.72]  i like the floor is made of bleach and the knife has ammonia in it okay all right so why don't we
[10231.72 --> 10237.16]  move on to our next merge message good it's easy to get you guys to move on hey guys i'm an injection
[10237.16 --> 10244.20]  molding technician and i thoroughly enjoy all of the bts molding content how much did the molder do and how
[10244.20 --> 10251.80]  much of your team uh how much did you learn personally i learned basically what was in kyle's video
[10252.36 --> 10256.52]  that we had to open the gate and do more simulation to make sure that it flows through
[10256.52 --> 10262.04]  the mold like this instead of going around things and then meeting and making those ugly uh those ugly
[10262.04 --> 10269.72]  lines um i learned about the different properties of plastics and you know some cool faster and some
[10269.72 --> 10274.12]  cool longer when they're flowing through the mold or stick to the mold or whatever else
[10275.16 --> 10280.44]  that's that's about it like i i didn't do any simulations or anything as for what our team has
[10280.44 --> 10286.12]  learned i will say that some of it was handled by the molder but it was definitely a collaborative
[10286.68 --> 10291.00]  process i i pretty much promise you that those simulations that we showed in the video were ones that
[10291.00 --> 10295.72]  our team was running we've learned a lot about plastic injection molding over the last few years
[10295.72 --> 10305.08]  here goes a new impulse buy did you need to add any anti-yellowing countermeasures or is that not an
[10305.08 --> 10309.80]  issue for this type of plastic i'm not aware of that being an issue for triton don't think it's a
[10309.80 --> 10316.04]  problem for triton looking at especially like okay so a very well-known brand that uses triton
[10316.04 --> 10322.44]  nalgene their water bottles you know water bottles these days a lot of people use them inside but
[10322.44 --> 10328.28]  for a long time they were like largely outdoor or indoor sports facility type water bottle culture
[10328.28 --> 10332.60]  has changed a lot dramatically changed i didn't even really think about but they did go outside a lot
[10332.60 --> 10334.84]  and nalgene bottles never really changed color
[10338.44 --> 10345.16]  now you know usually blue for a reason that's an interesting point but who the devil is this
[10345.16 --> 10352.60]  who are you number 317 anonymous with your 10 gift card purchase
[10356.92 --> 10365.56]  go ahead dan you can read it are you sure yeah it's very mean is it maybe linus also known as moo moo the cow
[10365.56 --> 10373.32]  how do you know that oh this is the thing that's my og hotmail account damn
[10374.76 --> 10380.84]  moo moo underscore the underscore cow at hotmail.com i don't have that email address anymore don't bother
[10380.84 --> 10389.96]  emailing it but that was that was my original like when i went to camp camp squia for bible camp you know
[10389.96 --> 10396.04]  that was the email that i gave to my fellow attendees so they could stay in touch is uh
[10397.16 --> 10407.48]  you said anonymous 13. 317 is the order number oh not the name that they put in no no sorry carry on
[10409.96 --> 10415.96]  damn uh do you find the existence or lack of your beard to have any effect on your viewership
[10415.96 --> 10420.28]  and do you still plan uh do you still have plans taking your name out of the branding of your
[10420.28 --> 10426.44]  company um i don't know we're kind of i think we're kind of experimenting right now um i am
[10427.16 --> 10435.00]  see i'm actually not quite done painting my bike i have put one back off maybe i put one coat of clear
[10435.00 --> 10443.88]  coat on the gas tank uh and then i made the mistake okay this is why jake tyvey drives me nuts because he
[10443.88 --> 10449.64]  was like no you should sand it you know like like fine sand it and i was like no i'm not gonna bother
[10449.64 --> 10453.24]  i don't care if there's a little bit of orange peel i want this project done he's like no you should do
[10453.24 --> 10458.52]  it and then i did the first coat of clear coat on the gas tank and there was like a little something
[10458.52 --> 10465.00]  like a little fluff got caught in it and i i could have sprayed it again and maybe like like gotten that
[10465.00 --> 10469.24]  bit out but probably not i probably would have scuffed the finish so i was gonna have to do another
[10469.24 --> 10473.88]  coat anyway so i was like okay well i'll just leave it with the one coat and then i'll i'll get
[10473.88 --> 10478.60]  the little bit out and then i'll blast the second coat and then it'll all be consistent i won't have
[10478.60 --> 10483.96]  the little like fluff or the little nib in it anyway as i was getting out the nib i was like oh i mean
[10483.96 --> 10487.72]  it wouldn't really hurt if i i'm just a thousand grit i can't really damage anything too badly i'll give
[10487.72 --> 10494.52]  it like a like kind of a once over and it looks so much better but now i'm thinking i've only delivered
[10494.52 --> 10500.36]  the wheels the frame and the subframe none of which i think stand out that much once the bike
[10500.36 --> 10504.76]  is assembled it's going to be the fairing it's going to be the tail it's going to be the gas tank
[10504.76 --> 10509.64]  that are really going to stand out so i still have all those pieces technically they haven't started
[10509.64 --> 10516.60]  reassembly yet so technically you could i could sand everything fine grit sand everything do you know
[10516.60 --> 10521.48]  when they're going to start blast it again and polish it do you have like this weekend and then that's it
[10521.48 --> 10528.52]  i don't know but i did thousand grit the gas tank and but like i don't want to get in there with like
[10528.52 --> 10533.00]  two thousand like five thousand grit like i i don't i don't know i don't have time for that
[10533.88 --> 10538.68]  um yes i know it looks better wet sanded yes yes yes it's worth it it's worth it
[10539.88 --> 10545.96]  um anyway so if that's the case i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to do a fair bit more clear coating
[10545.96 --> 10551.16]  if it was just going to be like hitting the gas tank once then i was just going to like put on the
[10551.48 --> 10556.92]  mask and like you know breathe as little as i can and not bother but if i'm if i'm going to be
[10556.92 --> 10560.68]  clear coating the entire rest of the bike again i'm probably gonna have to shave the beard so we'll
[10560.68 --> 10568.20]  see we'll see maybe i'll keep a mustache for like one week it'd be horrible dude it would be bad it
[10568.20 --> 10574.52]  would be horrible on me anyway okay i'm trying to wait even i can't even i feel like i can't even
[10574.52 --> 10578.92]  imagine it still plan to take my name out of branding of the company eventually yes that is still the goal
[10578.92 --> 10583.88]  don't don't think about it luke i kind of want to close your mind's eye i feel like i can imagine
[10583.88 --> 10591.56]  myself with one easier than i can imagine you with one nope it's gross nope i don't like it
[10592.68 --> 10599.40]  you have to do it uh hello from tampa returning from saudi arabia we could both do it for november
[10599.40 --> 10610.20]  nope all right do it now look at my razors uh hello from tampa returning from saudi arabia
[10611.32 --> 10616.52]  three security agents spent 30 minutes inspecting my mini itx build from my carry-on what are some
[10616.52 --> 10624.44]  challenges you faced with equipment at airports the biggest one is the carnet it's this stupid piece of
[10624.44 --> 10631.56]  paper that it's i think it's canadian customs insists on or is it you i can't remember someone
[10631.56 --> 10636.12]  insists on us having this stupid piece of paper that we bring to the airport and write down the
[10636.12 --> 10641.64]  serial numbers of all the like camera filming equipment that we bring with us and then when we
[10641.64 --> 10647.88]  come back we have to show them the carnet and that this is all equipment that we took with us in the
[10647.88 --> 10655.48]  first place that we're not importing it but it's just a piece of paper there's there's no tracking
[10656.04 --> 10662.04]  there's no validation and many of the agents don't even know about it so it's just a matter of like if
[10662.04 --> 10667.32]  you get the one that cares then they'll like hassle you about all the gear that you're taking over there
[10667.32 --> 10672.76]  even though you're clearly a professional video equipment person you don't you don't even have more
[10672.76 --> 10682.12]  than one of the same thing you're obviously not an importer it's just a big waste of time it means
[10682.12 --> 10686.76]  our camera ops have to show up at the airport like an hour sometimes an hour and a half earlier it's
[10686.76 --> 10691.48]  just so obnoxious uh it's not a airplane but i'm gonna tell the story anyways because it's probably
[10691.48 --> 10698.76]  been a long time but one time i had to for reasons uh transport my mineral oil computer from
[10698.76 --> 10706.12]  vancouver island to back home and i didn't have a car on the island so i had to bring it onto a bus
[10706.12 --> 10712.52]  so i had to hand carry on a wooden plank my mineral computer that had like at the time
[10713.72 --> 10719.56]  fish plants in it and stuff but also just computer parts and cables and all this wacky stuff absolute
[10719.56 --> 10724.20]  genius the bus driver absolutely did not want to let me on the bus because he thought it was a bomb
[10724.20 --> 10730.76]  um and i i actually i got on the bus but i i don't remember how i don't know if he just eventually
[10730.76 --> 10737.88]  kind of gave up and let me or or what i don't i don't remember at this point but but yeah i got it
[10737.88 --> 10742.20]  on the bus eventually and i got it home but i mean then i had to take it on the ferry and then all this
[10742.20 --> 10747.48]  kind of stuff and it got uh you know i got some looks you got some looks that's probably heavy as hell
[10747.48 --> 10753.96]  it wasn't light it wasn't particularly light there uh part of the spoiler of the story is that it
[10753.96 --> 10759.96]  didn't exactly have oil in it at that point in time or at least not a lot um but it it the oil was
[10759.96 --> 10763.56]  soaked into the wooden plank and i was carrying a computer on a plank for like
[10764.44 --> 10769.00]  plus the aquarium factor many hours yeah ridiculous yeah
[10771.16 --> 10776.84]  yeah howdy ldl from texas love the screwdriver and buying one for my dad question
[10776.84 --> 10783.48]  ai makes call scams harder to detect how can we verify who we're speaking to maybe encryption
[10783.48 --> 10791.48]  keys or back to the old safe words safe words safe words and just don't uh don't do anything
[10791.48 --> 10797.88]  when people call you yeah you can always call people back look up their number and call them back
[10797.88 --> 10803.00]  don't forget they could be sim jacked so even calling them back oh no don't call their direct
[10803.00 --> 10808.52]  number back just don't um like if your bank calls you or something like that oh i was talking like
[10808.52 --> 10812.20]  a like a like a loved one because you couldn't have a safe word with your bank i think they're talking
[10812.20 --> 10819.08]  about yeah like if you know your your wife calls you saying she's held ransom or whatever enough
[10819.08 --> 10823.96]  i'm sure you could call who i'm sure for the the company bank account you could have a safe word to be
[10823.96 --> 10833.48]  honest i i don't know you'd be surprised how inflexible um like policy is at places like we're
[10833.48 --> 10840.12]  we're uh again this comes down to that whole that whole age-old debate is linus media group a big
[10840.12 --> 10848.84]  company yeah in the in the in the scheme of like would banks just like have a special policy for us
[10848.84 --> 10855.08]  no it's funny because there are some that would little tiny credit unions but like
[10855.88 --> 10861.88]  not not big maybe but that's our issue is we're big enough that there's no way we could engage
[10861.88 --> 10866.04]  reasonably with a bank like that simply because they don't they they wouldn't deal in enough
[10866.04 --> 10876.60]  currency for us oh we deal in gbp euro uh cad usd at least and i'm pro there's probably some oh yeah
[10876.60 --> 10882.52]  no we definitely have um yen australian dollar yeah we have chinese yuan as well swedish krona
[10883.48 --> 10890.76]  we deal in all these different currencies so no idea we absolutely have to deal with like like a mega
[10890.76 --> 10895.80]  a mega bank um just because of all the different income streams that are coming from like like amazon
[10895.80 --> 10901.00]  affiliate australia or whatever right i don't even know if that's a thing but that's an example of the
[10901.00 --> 10907.32]  kind of reason that we might have some international currency coming in and um but we are not big
[10907.32 --> 10912.84]  enough for any organization like that to give two and a limp about us so
[10916.04 --> 10919.72]  two separate trips or like one so we're in this there are three people
[10919.72 --> 10927.40]  so we're just uh yeah i don't know we're in the like we're in like a weird middle ground and i'm
[10927.40 --> 10933.00]  not i'm not complaining i'm just saying that there have been times that it's been challenging
[10933.00 --> 10941.24]  like i remember when i wasn't able to borrow like literally a few months of of of revenue for like
[10941.24 --> 10946.44]  uh for for some reason for the business just because they like didn't recognize what kind of
[10946.44 --> 10951.40]  business we were it didn't matter it didn't matter that i'd be able to pay it back in a trivial amount
[10951.40 --> 10962.44]  of time didn't matter we just couldn't because we're nobody yep all right hit me all right let's
[10962.44 --> 10970.04]  see yeah hi lld about to receive a utility patent any advice for getting a device from prototype to
[10970.04 --> 10975.64]  finished product any pitfalls to avoid clear driver will go great with my og black shaft driver thanks
[10977.08 --> 10986.68]  any advice for getting it to finish product be patient time i submit do it right um understand
[10986.68 --> 10995.96]  that there may be compromises to be made along the way for instance there is one compromise on this
[10995.96 --> 11002.68]  there's almost no way that you guys would be able to see it but there's like um around the
[11002.68 --> 11012.60]  uh the bits of the um the the ratchet mechanism like the metal um like spine that comes out of the
[11012.60 --> 11018.04]  housing here there's kind of like um like a thin part of the wall it goes all the way around so it
[11018.04 --> 11022.76]  doesn't really like it doesn't matter you know but i know it's there it wasn't what we were trying to
[11022.76 --> 11028.84]  do we wanted it to to sit cleaner to the um i don't know what you're talking about yeah it doesn't
[11028.84 --> 11035.08]  matter it doesn't matter it's better if no one else can find it but the point is there will be
[11035.08 --> 11040.76]  little compromises be ready for that but also stick to your guns when it comes to quality never compromise
[11040.76 --> 11052.04]  on on the long lastingness of the product um i don't know as for pitfalls to avoid oh man um
[11053.64 --> 11059.16]  you know carefully qc what you get back from the factory make sure it's actually what you ask them
[11059.16 --> 11066.68]  for i still remember the first time we got a sample driver from um the chinese manufacturer that we
[11066.68 --> 11072.20]  switched to from the taiwanese ratchet manufacturer and it was like okay but not quite right and it
[11072.20 --> 11077.80]  turned out that they had somehow never gotten our drawings and had just cloned it based on the sample
[11077.80 --> 11084.68]  product we sent instead of creating it from the drawings and it was close enough that we couldn't
[11084.68 --> 11090.28]  tell wild that that was a default action yeah they didn't go oh you don't have drawings or anything
[11090.28 --> 11095.00]  they're just like yeah we got it we knew it was like we knew it was wrong but we couldn't tell why
[11095.00 --> 11105.00]  it was that close wow that's wild hi the cat distribution system sent a six month old cat my
[11105.00 --> 11112.36]  way she adapted well to the home and to me but is spicy with my resident old cats linus any tips from
[11112.36 --> 11119.64]  your shed kitten rescue into intro better no i mean they'll be the first thing anyone ever says to me is
[11119.64 --> 11124.92]  try fell away i found it really expensive and doesn't especially do anything the heck is that
[11124.92 --> 11131.64]  um it's like a cat pheromone that you just put into a wall plug like like those plug-in air fresheners um
[11132.60 --> 11137.16]  i just have not observed any difference in my cat's behavior across like half a dozen different
[11137.16 --> 11141.72]  cats now and i just i don't believe in it um i'm sure someone somewhere has had success with it but i
[11141.72 --> 11149.16]  just haven't as for um how things have gone with our cats our resident older lady cat uh was extremely
[11149.16 --> 11154.36]  aggressive with the new ones and she now lives with my aunt um that doesn't mean we don't love her anymore
[11154.36 --> 11161.48]  and it doesn't mean that we don't go to see her but uh she is much happier as a single cat household
[11161.48 --> 11167.16]  kitty and that was what was best for her and honestly my aunt is also thriving with dash living
[11167.16 --> 11174.36]  with her um i've i've told my aunt that she's a crazy cat lady in training for like 20 years now and
[11174.36 --> 11180.36]  uh it was just a matter of convincing my uncle but dash is just the coolest cat and within about
[11180.36 --> 11185.56]  three days he was telling my aunt they know they're not getting this cat back right so she's in an
[11185.56 --> 11190.52]  extremely loving home and one of the things my aunt was concerned about is that they're getting on in
[11190.52 --> 11198.44]  years and so we made it very clear to her that if anything were to happen um dash will come back to us
[11198.44 --> 11205.40]  and we'll just figure out how to integrate them better hello oh yeah sorry go for it uh i have a
[11205.40 --> 11211.88]  message from sir conrad merch message anonymous button is fixed it was an issue on the u.s site
[11212.68 --> 11219.40]  due to an app that we don't use anyways so he just installed the app uh and the flowpoint
[11219.40 --> 11226.68]  auth button is on the global site now yes because the sick the one who called you mr moo moo something
[11226.68 --> 11228.84]  or other what's his name again conchad
[11228.84 --> 11239.88]  instead of conrad oh okay that's good you get a ding for that he's a chad i thought you said
[11239.88 --> 11249.48]  calm calm no i was like what what's going on yeah um hello newcomb dynus and lan linus with your
[11250.20 --> 11257.32]  motorcycle being done soon i ride a cruiser style yamaha and regularly do iron butt rides every year
[11257.32 --> 11264.20]  what's the longest ride you've done on your bike uh iron butt not a particularly long ride but i
[11264.20 --> 11269.88]  don't ride a particularly comfortable bike i a ruins cape i went straight down to seattle from
[11269.88 --> 11276.68]  vancouver and that was the longest no stops um trip that i've taken on my motorbike i'm not like an avid
[11276.68 --> 11281.80]  rider i don't like go riding for the weekend or anything like that um don't really have time
[11281.80 --> 11289.24]  i'd love to armor trimming on a bicycle uh it's a 2003 sv 650s
[11291.24 --> 11298.92]  jokes for six people okay let's see morning lld i work in a secure office which means no wi-fi
[11298.92 --> 11304.92]  or bluetooth devices i would still like a device to track and remind me of meetings do you have any
[11304.92 --> 11313.00]  ideas i've been looking at electronic organizers from the 90s yeah those track and remind me of
[11313.00 --> 11320.68]  meetings would they accept a device that has the wi-fi bluetooth chipset taken out of it
[11323.80 --> 11330.20]  that's a good question it seems like a reasonable thing to do
[11330.20 --> 11335.00]  uh if they had a person who was capable of making sure that they were removed properly
[11335.00 --> 11339.32]  that is probably the biggest problem so you need something that by default doesn't have that despite
[11339.32 --> 11341.80]  the ability to add that to things yeah
[11345.96 --> 11351.88]  this is probably a secure office not like a military spec you are not allowed to have things
[11351.88 --> 11361.16]  on you and we will scan you and search you i mean i know there's like there's like digital watches
[11361.16 --> 11366.52]  that have no smart capabilities that have like multiple alarms okay i didn't know the multiple
[11366.52 --> 11371.16]  alarms part that's why i didn't actually say it yeah um
[11374.76 --> 11381.64]  yeah virtual said i says that's not surprising we are told that even wireless keyboards are a security
[11381.64 --> 11387.80]  risk some offices are crazy um luke that's what we should do on top of threat locker is ban all
[11387.80 --> 11397.00]  wireless devices nice okay fogelbr says likely not if this is a sif then the device has to be on
[11397.00 --> 11404.60]  approved lists from the government interesting yeah no i i don't know your information facility
[11404.60 --> 11409.80]  is that what's yeah vintage palm pilot i think man a lot of those older pocket pcs and stuff though they
[11409.80 --> 11417.00]  had wi-fi you'd have to go quite old yeah 90s like i think i think you could get an apple newton
[11417.00 --> 11423.24]  no i think even that oh no yeah it doesn't have wi-fi it doesn't have wi-fi uh it would be so cool
[11423.24 --> 11429.64]  if you rocked up with an apple newton that would be sick apple newton that's my official recommendation
[11429.64 --> 11441.08]  let's go i second that okay hi dopamine serotonin serotonin hi dopamine serotonin and oxytocin you
[11441.08 --> 11447.16]  have mentioned having lots of games in your steam libraries which you have not had a chance to play
[11447.16 --> 11453.08]  what were some of the hidden gems once you played them i actually did a whole video really yep
[11453.08 --> 11462.68]  and then uh i never actually i in the video i was like here i am trying every unplayed game in my
[11462.68 --> 11468.28]  steam backlog i did this four years ago it was really fun and i found a bunch of games that i was
[11468.28 --> 11476.92]  like oh i'm gonna come back and play this one never did oh you can favorite things in steam i know i
[11476.92 --> 11482.28]  know i need to go back and re-watch this video now so that i know which ones i wanted to play yeah
[11484.04 --> 11490.12]  luke i had a shared account just like that on steam only i was the one who ended up with the
[11490.12 --> 11495.64]  account in the end so did he yeah it was a blast seeing uh the new games and giving them a try for
[11495.64 --> 11505.48]  free nice honestly it's it's it was surprisingly like fun and uh the last one i've got for you tonight
[11505.48 --> 11512.04]  is luke have you started any new final fantasy games yet no but i'm gonna play tactics
[11513.08 --> 11517.64]  oh are you going which one are you gonna play
[11520.20 --> 11526.12]  isn't there well no the one coming to steam so they're okay okay that was the plan not the only
[11526.12 --> 11530.84]  version okay so i would say that playing the pixel remaster for final fantasy 6 was actually a mistake
[11530.84 --> 11535.64]  i wouldn't say you should like replay it at this point because that whatever um replay it i'm not
[11535.64 --> 11542.04]  playing it again i know i wouldn't say you should replay it but i if i were to go back and tell you
[11542.04 --> 11547.80]  you got to play this game again i would have you play the original snes version oh i see um so for
[11547.80 --> 11553.88]  tactics obviously i haven't played the new one yet but there are actually now i would say three valid
[11553.88 --> 11560.92]  choices for playing final fantasy tactics one would be obviously the the new one that's coming to steam
[11560.92 --> 11569.64]  another another would be final fantasy tactics for playstation one the original release and the other
[11569.64 --> 11572.20]  would be final fantasy tactics war of the lions
[11574.92 --> 11577.48]  so war of the lions um
[11577.48 --> 11589.16]  is this a remaster or is this a different game so it was kind of it was kind of a re-release slash
[11589.16 --> 11596.44]  android uh well no it's for the psp android ios it says since when is that for what i don't know it's
[11596.44 --> 11603.56]  which was both of them don't worry about that it's for the psp uh it was released in 1997 and is
[11603.56 --> 11611.80]  considered by many to be kind of the um i don't know the the definitive version of final fantasy tactics
[11612.44 --> 11621.00]  however as someone who never actually played war of the lions um i can't i can't tell you that i think
[11621.00 --> 11627.88]  any of the things they added to it would improve anything oh well look at that you can get war of
[11627.88 --> 11635.32]  the lions for uh for ios and android okay that's cool but i wouldn't say that anything that i can
[11635.32 --> 11642.84]  see that they added to it um would significantly improve the game for me it has a less janky translation
[11642.84 --> 11649.24]  but in my opinion i enjoy that i enjoy the jankier translation in my opinion the original janky
[11649.24 --> 11655.16]  translation aside from a couple cases where meanings can be obscured a little bit um is part of its
[11655.16 --> 11665.00]  charm and don't sell me a dog drugstore cowboy and some of the like new characters just what no one's
[11665.00 --> 11673.00]  gonna understand that reference but yeah just felt like kind of cringy um fan service
[11673.00 --> 11682.52]  so you could there's a couple new classes but like they seem pretty op i'm googling it
[11684.44 --> 11687.08]  no one cares okay look play whatever version of the game you want
[11687.08 --> 11699.24]  i don't really like playing games on my phone no you can i'm just thinking it's psp emulators yeah
[11699.24 --> 11705.64]  yeah so you've got three you've got three valid options to play and i'm afraid to recommend
[11705.64 --> 11708.60]  ivilis chronicles that the the re-release
[11708.60 --> 11716.68]  don't sell me a dog don't sell me a dog drugstore cowboy with a huge crest in the middle for some
[11716.68 --> 11723.32]  reason uh this isn't the exact one but i saw this on a shirt on a hat in taiwan my first time the
[11723.32 --> 11727.40]  second time there and i bought it for emma i still still have that's uh that's good i like
[11728.52 --> 11733.72]  so here's something and yeah sydney broke it is saying this in chat the remake is removing a bunch of
[11733.72 --> 11740.92]  the fan servicey things in war of the lions so it's apparently meant to be there was apparently
[11740.92 --> 11746.44]  the source code was lost is that is that right you guys so they ended up having it's very much like
[11746.44 --> 11754.36]  a fan service game but was was initiated by like someone from the original team like replaying it
[11754.36 --> 11758.44]  again and being like no this is this is the definitive version and wanting to bring it to
[11758.44 --> 11765.80]  modern platforms instead of war of the lions which um yeah apparently it'll include a classic version
[11765.80 --> 11771.48]  yeah apparently uh oh okay no i think they i think i i thought i was reading that they lost at least some
[11772.12 --> 11776.76]  of the source apparently ivilis chronicles will include two different versions of the game enhanced
[11776.76 --> 11782.68]  and classic so which would you play enhanced or classic so i i need to really get through the
[11782.68 --> 11788.76]  details of the details of the changes if it's just graphics honestly i don't care there was a mode
[11788.76 --> 11792.92]  where you could kind of see the old graphics on the pixel remaster and i was like
[11795.96 --> 11803.08]  sure you could take either it's fine um so the classic version of the re-release will have the war
[11803.08 --> 11807.56]  of the lions translation though so if you want the original playstation kind of janky translation
[11808.12 --> 11812.04]  you'll have to emulate playstation one which can be done very easily these days
[11812.68 --> 11821.08]  you have time to decide maybe i'll buy the steam one and then emulate it yeah that's that's a valid
[11821.08 --> 11825.88]  choice because i never bought this back in the day opinion i don't have any like i didn't have any
[11825.88 --> 11830.60]  final fantasy i the only game i had was final fantasy eight oh here's a fun piracy conversation sure
[11831.24 --> 11839.16]  i own a final fantasy tactics disc for playstation one oh if i lent you my give me the disc and i didn't
[11839.16 --> 11844.12]  play the game while you were playing it that's valid i'd be okay with that you'd be okay emulating
[11844.12 --> 11851.56]  it yep well i won't because technically i have an old playstation they oh this is interesting people
[11851.56 --> 11856.84]  are like valid chat says valid i think it's fine chat says valid i think it's fine well i'm not i'm
[11856.84 --> 11861.00]  not giving it to you because i actually love that they're remastering the original game and they should
[11861.00 --> 11864.52]  get money for it yeah i'm cool with that so i'm not going to lend you the game i'm fine with that but
[11864.52 --> 11869.72]  yeah it's one of the handful of like retro games that i own actually i think i bought it from david
[11869.72 --> 11873.64]  when he did his liquidation sale i was like oh you have final fantasy tactics i've played this game
[11873.64 --> 11878.20]  like three times and i've never owned a copy i feel bad i would either go to willow and buy my own old
[11878.20 --> 11884.60]  school copy or i think it is also fair in my opinion to buy the new one and then just emulate the old
[11884.60 --> 11890.28]  one i think that's fine okay that is that my brain is okay with that you know what my brain's okay with
[11890.28 --> 11896.28]  telling you guys hey we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[11904.20 --> 11905.64]  i was only three hours today
[11909.24 --> 11911.80]  i make the old rain show the five hour long
[11913.72 --> 11915.80]  you get over four hours laughing
