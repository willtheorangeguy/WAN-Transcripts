[0.00 → 5.44] everybody and welcome to the wan show it's going to be a great show today is what I would say
[5.44 → 16.58] if Microsoft hadn't done the unthinkable the appalling the inexcusable thing that they did
[16.58 → 24.28] I'm actually genuinely upset about it, they have killed the blue screen of death how can you how
[24.28 → 29.26] can one kill death doesn't make any sense we'll be talking about that we're also going to be
[29.26 → 34.54] talking about some additional issues this week that house fresh who you guys may remember if you
[34.54 → 42.54] watched the big video this week that we did on uh companies suing honest reviewers that house fresh
[42.54 → 48.90] um highlighted where basically as far as we can tell independent review sites like theirs
[48.90 → 54.86] could be headed for yet another kick in the teeth while they're down what else we got this week
[54.86 → 59.70] any good news oh that can't be good news you already said enough words that I know it's not
[59.70 → 65.36] good news, but sure do go on it might not even be news to be completely honest the trump phone no
[65.36 → 72.70] longer promises that it's made in America and also somebody made their own version of a steam controller
[72.70 → 77.58] pretty cool that's good news that's fun that's positive
[77.58 → 101.86] the show is brought to you today by oh I did it a little early rove lab proton and thrum of course
[101.86 → 109.14] alongside our wrap partner brand our laptop partner uh dell and our chair partner secret lab
[109.14 → 117.12] let's jump right into what is of course the big news this week Microsoft has killed the BSOD
[117.12 → 126.04] and introduced the BSOD that's right after nearly 40 years of blue screens except for that short period
[126.04 → 130.94] with Windows vista, but nobody remembers that Microsoft has decided that they want to and this is a quote
[130.94 → 139.86] improve clarity and provide better information on their kernel panic error screen so gone is the blue
[139.86 → 149.22] screen of death and in is the black screen of death which will now list the stop code and the application
[149.22 → 157.94] that triggered it but riddle me this Mr Luke cafetière what if anything had prevented Microsoft
[157.94 → 165.14] from literally putting that information on a blue screen yeah they didn't have to make literally any
[165.14 → 169.24] changes other than just adding information that should have been there for the last
[169.24 → 174.14] entire amount of time this is just dumb
[174.14 → 183.50] I am actually more annoyed than I should be but very annoyed well i, for one, am actually pretty happy
[183.50 → 188.44] about at least part of this um the oh yeah the more information is good yeah the more information
[188.44 → 195.90] is a huge plus I mean the number of times that I have encountered an error on a Windows-based system
[195.90 → 206.02] and had it just say you know error uh handling at the know zero x eight three two
[206.02 → 211.92] and you google it, and it's just like there's no information it's like brother yeah if you know
[211.92 → 219.66] what caused the crash which you must because there's some kind of code that has to indicate something
[219.66 → 227.02] tell me and a lot of the time you know I still remember the first time I fired up the reliability
[227.02 → 235.20] uh history and the um what's the other one, so there's reliability monitor and performance monitor
[235.20 → 240.52] has some reliability stuff in it as well but the first time I fired up reliability history and I was
[240.52 → 248.76] like oh my god it just tells you in plain text this was caused by your NVIDIA driver thank you why
[248.76 → 253.66] wouldn't it just why wouldn't it just say that right on the crash screen where any user would know where
[253.66 → 259.82] to find it like that's a huge plus I'm actually I'm actually I'm super down with pretty stoked on
[259.82 → 263.90] like you're you're taking it I just hate when companies take like
[263.90 → 275.22] everyone liked this I mean no one liked you know getting a blue screen no, but they liked that it
[275.22 → 281.90] was the blue screen it was part of the culture, and you know what Microsoft i i actually
[281.90 → 287.54] really loved when we went from the old blue screen of death the little unhappy face was awesome
[287.54 → 295.94] to the little unhappy face um i I liked that they added the progress bar for sure uh for uh dumping the
[295.94 → 301.48] the error just add the info to this and and and the funny thing is they actually like have always had
[301.48 → 307.48] some information about the error so, and it's actually yeah here as well that's a terrible
[307.48 → 312.52] screenshot that we can't really like see but there is information they had a QR code um
[312.52 → 318.72] I don't really see the point of losing the iconic blue colour just don't change the colour the rest of
[318.72 → 325.20] it's great I have no issues like please yes add more information fantastic if the title was Microsoft
[325.20 → 332.00] upgrades the blue screen of death it would have just been awesome yeah yeah yeah it would have been
[332.00 → 337.18] great news I mean every time Microsoft has upgraded core operating system utilities things like task
[337.18 → 344.60] manager yeah i i think we've met those changes with um extreme positivity in fact I was dude
[344.60 → 348.24] I was back on an older version I forget what version of windows I was on but I was on an older version
[348.24 → 352.56] of windows that doesn't have a lot of the new quality of life features of the current task manager
[352.56 → 359.52] new task manager is way better I was like man search dude this sucks search is like fantastic
[359.52 → 367.42] what search in task manager on Windows oh jeez oh no, no no, no no, no only in the task I thought you
[367.42 → 373.94] meant windows search I was like brother are you actually high it's what are you talking it's not even
[373.94 → 380.06] April the 20th like what are you even doing right now no yeah just the task manager a ancient
[380.06 → 385.90] task manager didn't have search oh yeah no for sure yeah Luke rage baiting a hundred percent I wasn't
[385.90 → 392.30] trying to okay our discussion question and I want to get into this because I actually think that our
[392.30 → 399.22] writing team is on to something here please read entire question before reading please read entire
[399.22 → 406.92] question before reading please read entire question before reading
[406.92 → 417.56] these are my instructions so I'm going to ignore them Microsoft seems scared of their own Jacky legacy
[417.56 → 424.42] reading aloud when we were working on the one word when we were working on the Altair sleeper build
[424.42 → 432.62] the brand asked us not to use Clippy in it because of Clippy's kind of controversial history
[432.62 → 438.58] uh but the thing that Microsoft or at least the thing you got to understand Microsoft huge company
[438.58 → 444.14] so there's going to be people at Microsoft that totally get it all the way to people at Microsoft
[444.14 → 449.62] who don't get it at all and most people are going to land somewhere in between so the particular person
[449.62 → 453.62] we were talking with which i who I think actually worked for an agency for Microsoft not even Microsoft
[453.62 → 459.98] directly tried to talk us out of putting Clippy in that Altair build but the thing that they didn't
[459.98 → 464.70] seem to be attuned to is that culture moves a little bit faster than corporate policy
[464.70 → 471.70] and people actually like Clippy now Clippy is like people like the prequels now kitschy and retro like
[471.70 → 480.32] if Microsoft seriously is Microsoft made like a desk ornament oh giant paper clip with googly eyes and a
[480.32 → 486.74] smile that you could just have as like decor in your home office or whatever people would
[486.74 → 493.00] legitimately buy that like if they did a limited edition Clippy statue i Clippy holds a special place
[493.00 → 500.60] dude yeah of course dude would you consider would you consider like uh you know
[500.60 → 505.08] those little vinyl figurines like little collectible vinyl figurines sure you don't buy anything but put
[505.08 → 510.52] yourself in the mindset of someone who buys a thing Elijah okay sure would you okay but can't be
[510.52 → 515.24] Elijah because he's too young to remember any of this stuff remember the like the little dog
[515.24 → 521.70] in the Windows XP search yeah that would like go get things for your yeah yeah would you buy like
[521.70 → 529.70] vinyl figures of the various XP like search mascots and stuff like that okay, so no collectible would
[529.70 → 535.00] that be as we've established I don't really buy stuff but if they're like you know we did a long
[535.00 → 540.42] time ago we had like a desk budget yeah yeah if I had a desk budget absolutely I would buy that for
[540.42 → 545.04] my work desk yeah the dog the wizard the little dog the wizard the little dog the wizard and Clippy
[545.04 → 551.64] as like a trio would go so hard that would be so cool I was reminiscing about the installation wizard like
[551.64 → 559.30] last week used to be awesome um so do you think this is part of the same kind of
[559.30 → 566.20] I don't know what it is discomfort with sort of troubled parts of your history that we encountered
[566.20 → 571.52] when they didn't want us to have Clippy in the video by the way we drew a line we drew a line
[571.52 → 576.00] we were like there were a couple of things that they were not brand safe enough for them and we were
[576.00 → 580.16] like yeah we figured we probably weren't going to get away with that we pulled it out, but they wanted
[580.16 → 588.00] Clippy gone we said no Clippy stays, and we were a hundred percent right like the audience freaking
[588.00 → 593.34] loved it so that was really cool Microsoft was actually shockingly easy to work with on that
[593.34 → 598.18] like every brand guys you got to understand every brand has their like weird sensitivities and
[598.18 → 603.92] of course so we their history and their policies and all that so yeah yeah a hundred percent what was I uh
[603.92 → 611.66] I had an I had a long conversation earlier this week with uh Bridget and Sarah from creator warehouse
[611.66 → 620.26] and we were kind of talking about you know what do we envision as the brand for CW because up until now
[620.26 → 627.16] CW has mostly been an internal department that creates white label products for lttstore.com and
[627.16 → 633.02] for Linus tech tips and our various media properties right but in the longer term creator warehouse
[633.02 → 641.06] absolutely has the chops to create white label products for someone else or create its own branded
[641.06 → 646.78] entities or whatever right like if we're talking on a long enough timescale five years ten years fifteen
[646.78 → 653.16] twenty years right what could that team not do what would you look the CW team in the eye and say no
[653.16 → 654.08] you couldn't do that
[654.08 → 662.56] they could probably get a rocket into space oh well oh okay no I bet you they could
[662.56 → 664.26] just not manned
[664.26 → 668.08] I bet you an unmanned rocket they could do it
[668.08 → 676.12] so okay with that in mind then um it was an it was a really cool uh really open conversation and
[676.12 → 682.38] what we were really focused on is sort of what are our core values um you know what are the key
[682.38 → 688.22] pain points we're trying to alleviate for the average consumer, and you know what should our brand
[688.22 → 695.32] voice be and one of the conversations that we kind of got into it a little on was around the words geek
[695.32 → 703.78] and nerd okay so I'm not going to say who was on which side because that's not important for the
[703.78 → 709.64] conversation right now um well yeah like I don't want to I don't want people to be like oh yeah that
[709.64 → 715.48] person they have such a stupid perspective on this or whatever because um one of the things that came out
[715.48 → 724.08] of that conversation is that while a lot of people are not offended by them or even self-identify as
[724.08 → 731.26] a keyboard nerd or a tech geek or whatever the case may be for a lot of people those words are
[731.26 → 738.58] a little divisive and so on of the things that I think we kind of settled on at the end of the at
[738.58 → 744.22] the end of the conversation although nothing's ever really in stone I think that uh the world changes
[744.22 → 748.44] and if we're not willing to change alongside it then we're going to be left behind but one of the
[748.44 → 757.30] things that was kind of settled on up until now was hey um that's not going to be part of like our
[757.30 → 766.08] our CW corporate branding maybe you could have like a super laser focused sub brand that is like
[766.08 → 771.18] you know uh geek wear, or you know or something like that like uh and this wasn't even part of the
[771.18 → 776.52] conversation but like you know like super street wear looking but like everything's a tech reference
[776.52 → 783.08] or something like you mean tech wear not street wear right no I mean like street wear yeah I call
[783.08 → 787.22] it is like geek wear, and it's like styled like street wear, but it's like everything's got like
[787.22 → 792.28] tech references or something we wouldn't do that like it's a bad idea don't worry um but just like
[792.28 → 797.90] that's an example of the kind of thing that you know I think we could be comfortable using a word
[797.90 → 808.16] like oh I like that like geek for textiles okay anyway but like spelled to e ch the point is
[808.16 → 816.96] that we's pretty good frank Reynolds in chat it's not me it's good though the point is that every
[816.96 → 823.48] every brand has their own kind of like sensitivities and one of the things that you know not everyone
[823.48 → 830.92] necessarily realized is that those words can be really divisive for people um and sometimes
[830.92 → 836.98] I think we uh we I think it's easy to project our own feelings on things so you know for us, we're
[836.98 → 841.56] sitting here going oh yeah the blue screen of death is like cool, but that doesn't change the fact
[841.56 → 847.38] that for a lot of people working at Microsoft the blue screen of death could be like a really negative
[847.38 → 852.50] part of their job you know if that's something that they are dealing with basically constantly
[852.50 → 861.38] is partners customers their own internal support agents um just like constantly talking about
[861.38 → 865.72] how much they hate this thing because of the negativity associated with it like it's an emotional
[865.72 → 871.72] connection every time you see a blue screen of death something bad happened I'm not saying I agree
[871.72 → 881.14] I think that it's also equally an iconic part of Microsoft's brand acronyms acronym even the acronym
[881.14 → 887.22] is still the same yeah, yeah like they're not getting away from anything they just made it boring yeah
[887.22 → 894.66] so our question is how do brands navigate the nostalgia for their rocky past while successfully
[894.66 → 900.98] branding for a modern audience embracing failures practically always wins i i think the
[900.98 → 906.18] smiley face was uh I think the smiley face was a huge win I think there are always this was an
[906.18 → 911.72] amazing win I think there are ways that they could make it even friendlier um like I think if
[911.72 → 917.72] you had liked you know uh a rotating kind of okay like you know how Microsoft has those uh those
[917.72 → 922.98] automatically rotating wallpapers uh for your lock screen yep like you can just tell it like I don't
[922.98 → 927.44] know you pick a pick a lock screen you know wallpaper for me or whatever like I think if every blue
[927.44 → 931.86] screen looked a little different like that that'd be kind of cool like that'd be a way I'm just saying
[931.86 → 938.50] that's a way to modernize it sure I mean I think if you don't agree just no just being friendlier in
[938.50 → 943.72] general with it like um what do I have like a section that literally just says what do I do now
[943.72 → 948.68] yeah and then it is details like some next steps that you could take something like that
[948.68 → 955.32] yeah there 's's a bunch of ways they could make it better just being like oh we're gonna hue shift
[955.32 → 964.08] it to black is uh not one of them, and you know what doesn't make the trump phone better it not
[964.08 → 971.60] actually being made in America the trump organization launched a phone and wireless carrier last week
[971.60 → 981.10] with the um somewhat not that credible claim that the phone was made in America
[981.10 → 989.40] many people rightly were highly skeptical of this made in America claim and now the website has
[989.40 → 996.50] removed any mention of that specific claim and replaced it with other things so here let's go
[996.50 → 1003.04] ahead and let's make our way to uh the phone and see if we can find some of the differences here
[1003.04 → 1010.92] okay no proudly American they have a period after premium performance but no period after
[1010.92 → 1019.44] probably American uh I mean nothing's really how do you narrow down the things that are random and
[1019.44 → 1028.10] weird about a page like this you know Luke like what here hold on can I zoom why am I not able to
[1028.10 → 1035.26] here we go what are these dots yeah I don't know I was wondering if that was I feel like that's got to
[1035.26 → 1041.02] be a reference to something I mean I'm not sure what does anyone in chat no I wouldn't, I wouldn't
[1041.02 → 1048.04] assume that like this I get on the one because no, no those are stars are those stars though I mean
[1048.04 → 1054.10] they're certainly not aligned in any meaningful way whereas like this seems like it's got the
[1054.10 → 1059.64] original 14 states yeah I thought it is that what this is something is there one two three four five six
[1059.64 → 1064.90] seven eight nine ten eleven twelve wait hold on 13 14 one two three four five six seven eight nine
[1064.90 → 1069.78] ten oh okay, okay okay, okay original 14 states okay that's something that's something so why are they
[1069.78 → 1074.10] in, so why is there a period here is this for the original mayflower
[1074.10 → 1082.12] I'm just asking I'm just wondering okay so what kind of what kind of wording do we have now
[1082.12 → 1087.00] proudly American designed with American values in mind
[1087.00 → 1098.04] American proud design that is the biggest load of horse that I think that I have ever seen on a
[1098.04 → 1104.52] product page but the 13 state stars all the flags they're in a circle they're not like in a random
[1104.52 → 1109.68] scattered arrangement what is the reference where they're all just like I don't know Luke I'm over
[1109.68 → 1117.56] it at this point I really don't think it matters that much okay um American proud design what does
[1117.56 → 1124.78] that mean American proud design seems like a weird way to arrange that sentence uh what else do we have
[1124.78 → 1131.28] okay this is great this is great it gets better out American design it's brought to life right here in
[1131.28 → 1140.76] the USA what did what do you mean by brought what does bring to life mean with American hands behind
[1140.76 → 1150.64] every device well someone has to deliver it I guess somebody's going to deliver it I guess we don't have
[1150.64 → 1157.62] automated deliveries yet somebody's gotta you know move it once it gets to the port I think oh the
[1157.62 → 1163.88] verge also noted that the specs have now changed that happened fast um the screen is smaller than
[1163.88 → 1170.20] before and there is no ram capacity specified our discussion question is how could this happen
[1170.20 → 1179.98] I mean that's uh how do you go as far as launching a phone and wireless carrier like you think about the
[1179.98 → 1187.60] amount of work that even the most lazy of wireless carrier creators would have had to put into something
[1187.60 → 1193.20] like that to launch a wireless carrier I don't know because they're just on somebody else's backbone sure
[1193.20 → 1201.26] but you would have had to like to have meetings you know how do you manage to do that much work
[1201.26 → 1207.64] and not manage to know how big the screen of your flagship product launch phone is yeah
[1207.64 → 1213.56] like is it not embarrassing at a certain point apparently not enough
[1213.56 → 1220.02] our next discussion question is how would you approach a loved one who has purchased
[1220.02 → 1226.34] a t1 phone you know what I'm not going to answer that I'm not going to answer that Dan what are
[1226.34 → 1231.16] what loved one what are we supposed to be what are we supposed to be doing next well you've still got
[1231.16 → 1237.02] time so why not another topic sure let's do let's do another topic you want to pick one do we want to
[1237.02 → 1241.18] lift me up you want to pick me up yeah let's do a pick me up steam controller electric steam
[1241.18 → 1246.34] controller 2 electric boogaloo do you want to bring up the pictures he's doing something else with
[1246.34 → 1252.68] I do Tommy b posted a video just over a week ago showcasing their custom steam controller 2 which was
[1252.68 → 1258.62] meant to replicate the steam deck's controller layout including the touchpads he built uh he built
[1258.62 → 1265.32] several PCBs and even the touchpads themselves he built the touchpads themselves yeah yeah that's pretty
[1265.32 → 1270.42] cool that's I didn't actually know that part uh before throwing it into a retro purple transparent
[1270.42 → 1274.64] case I've seen that it looks amazing uh walking through the steps he went through to get the
[1274.64 → 1282.78] controller working in games look at it how cool is that look at if it's two halves of a steam deck it looks so
[1282.78 → 1292.96] sick it actually looks shockingly usable yeah like wow yeah 100 if valve just released this
[1292.96 → 1300.76] people would buy the crap out of it yeah probably and like yeah okay, okay okay I get if it's square
[1300.76 → 1305.78] you guys it's square there are probably a few things that could be done to make it a little
[1305.78 → 1310.94] more ergonomic but like foundationally to be able to couch game without a huge couch commander
[1310.94 → 1317.42] on games that are not traditionally super great for thumb sticks because you have the touchpads people
[1317.42 → 1321.36] would love this that's what they really liked about the original uh steam controller you could play games
[1321.36 → 1327.96] like save on your couch easier which was awesome um and I know sieve has console ports now but
[1327.96 → 1336.06] yeah but still trackpad better um he added a nice touch of having uh them separate
[1336.06 → 1342.46] just like joy cons on a Nintendo Switch yeah oh that's so cool having individual batteries in the
[1342.46 → 1348.86] two sides so you can like game like this if you want you got your track it's it is can be way more
[1348.86 → 1355.64] relaxed to be able to put your arms down at your sides and the best part everything is open source
[1355.64 → 1360.20] with lots of other guides in case you want to attempt it yourself here's a question uh hold on
[1360.20 → 1365.62] quickly uh Dan do you mind throwing the link to his video into both the YouTube and twitch chats i
[1365.62 → 1372.58] threw it in float plane already here's a question I don't know if there's like a video for us here
[1372.58 → 1379.28] that's not really a question but in a situation like this say with the guy that made the laptop
[1379.28 → 1383.42] oh yeah no this guy's on our radar or this controller oh I don't even necessarily mean in
[1383.42 → 1390.06] that way oh like would it be cool if we just made one following the guide um making one following the
[1390.06 → 1396.36] guide is that fair to them is there enough I mean it's open source but yeah but making one
[1396.36 → 1403.50] away from their video making one following the guide is super cool but making one by bringing
[1403.50 → 1410.54] the creator here and having them show it off and co-host has two additional benefits number one
[1410.54 → 1415.28] is we get to highlight a smaller creator yeah because that's the core reason why I would want
[1415.28 → 1421.82] to do it and number two is I don't have to build it he already built it what
[1421.82 → 1427.86] so you're not you're not going to build one camera you're just going to look at his
[1427.86 → 1433.66] literally instead of paying someone on our staff to build one which realistically is what would
[1433.66 → 1437.46] probably happen from like a because it's cooking show right like from a video production
[1437.46 → 1442.24] standpoint right I'm not saying I would never do a DIY project again I'm just saying that
[1442.24 → 1447.96] painting my bike almost killed me I'm just I'm just saying that right now I have another project
[1447.96 → 1453.24] that if I have is I have two hours to link around with something I'm doing that also I still have to
[1453.24 → 1459.54] upgrade my ally I have the so like battery upgrade kit with the back panel and like i i got my
[1459.54 → 1469.00] own project i I do not have a lack of projects sir no lack okay i refuse to shop at IKEA
[1469.00 → 1476.52] for that particular for that particular furniture no lack guy okay thank you Dan um I was very
[1476.52 → 1487.12] enthusiastic it fit the rubric um so yeah so I could either pay someone to build it or I could pay him
[1487.12 → 1491.64] to fly up here no that's cool, and then we also get to highlight him I think it's way better my thing
[1491.64 → 1497.80] I get a conflict in my head because I'm like okay there's an open source project that I want people
[1497.80 → 1504.28] to do more, and it's making a cool hardware thing that is within our realm obviously we should make
[1504.28 → 1509.80] one in order to boost this, but then the other confusion comes in with this person is also a
[1509.80 → 1517.72] YouTuber who has their own video on it so I don't want to take yeah so it's an it's an interesting
[1517.72 → 1522.04] concept but if we fly them up I mean that just yeah that just kind of solves everything
[1522.04 → 1528.44] yeah um, and then you also can in some cases get a little bit of context that wasn't really present in
[1528.44 → 1533.88] the original video necessarily yeah um no I mean there's always the like you release a video start
[1533.88 → 1537.72] seeing some comments or whatever else, and it's like oh yeah okay it would have been cool if I said this or
[1537.72 → 1544.60] said that or whatever and i I like collabing I like meeting with new people i uh you know we don't
[1544.60 → 1551.00] we haven't always found the most time for it necessarily but when we're able to do it I think
[1551.00 → 1557.64] it's I think it's just it's a win-win and there 's's no reason not to so I think uh yeah I think
[1557.64 → 1563.88] we'll just we'll, we'll just reach out and um you know no guarantees maybe he's yeah it might not be
[1563.88 → 1568.36] interesting, or maybe it doesn't work for our schedule, or maybe we realize you know after chatting that you
[1568.36 → 1572.44] know what his video said everything that needed to be said about it, so there's not really a lot more
[1572.44 → 1581.24] meat on this chicken um so I'm not I'm not promising it'll work out but uh hey it doesn't
[1581.24 → 1586.92] it doesn't hurt to start a conversation the worst thing that can happen is we meet someone new yeah
[1588.92 → 1593.08] yeah, and we collab, and then they hate us forever you know yeah
[1595.32 → 1596.60] I mean that only happened once
[1596.60 → 1601.64] uh
[1601.64 → 1602.28] uh
[1602.28 → 1604.84] new topic or what yes
[1605.96 → 1611.24] uh sure you have 13 minutes left we can talk about another one Riot Games esports sponsored by
[1611.96 → 1617.40] sports betting I thought you were picking me up topics is there any more in the doc
[1617.40 → 1621.88] I think so you get like one a month yeah the RTX
[1621.88 → 1627.16] 50 50 50 is coming out that's a that's a pick me up well it's a pickup for
[1630.92 → 1631.16] the
[1634.20 → 1635.08] take your time
[1635.08 → 1648.36] this last Tuesday NVIDIA announced that the RTX 50 50 starting uh video announced the RTX 50 50
[1648.36 → 1652.76] starting at 240 I'm struggling today uh their announcement includes lots of charts flexing
[1652.76 → 1658.44] gains with DSS because of course it does and frame gen but no direct comparisons with those
[1658.44 → 1668.12] technologies turned off so here's the question yes has NVIDIA learned nothing I think they learned a lot
[1668.12 → 1673.96] actually I think they learned that marketing with DSS and frame gen on works yeah I think they learned a
[1673.96 → 1679.88] ton I think the community taught them very well very effectively
[1679.88 → 1690.36] yeah for sure uh it includes uh 2560 kudu course the same number that was included in the RTX 3050
[1690.92 → 1701.08] let's go it also uses the same gddr6 that the RTX 3050 had uh NVIDIA apparently chose this to be more
[1701.08 → 1706.28] power efficient but at 130 watts it will still require an external power connector
[1706.28 → 1713.16] uh that's weird I hosted tech linked today and there was a bit of a conflicting story there oh
[1713.16 → 1721.72] um i it uses gddr7 in the mobile variant which was apparently chosen for its better efficiency
[1721.72 → 1726.92] and uses gddr6 on the desktop variant because I guess who cares about efficiency you're running a
[1726.92 → 1734.20] desktop was the version of things that I heard oh so basically
[1734.20 → 1743.00] man how can we oh man wait it oh man i was uh what i I missed this part when you were reading
[1743.00 → 1748.36] through the thing it actually has the same number of kudu cores as the 3050 says so in the doc that is
[1748.36 → 1757.56] actually embarrassing yeah so it's like a juiced 3050 but with like more AI yeah
[1757.56 → 1770.36] how am I supposed to be excited about this Luke uh you're not let's go okay our discussion question
[1770.36 → 1779.08] is 3050 is what GPU would you buy for 250 dollars so here let's let's head over to I don't even know i
[1779.08 → 1784.20] you know I always default to new egg because I'm not actually American so I don't actually shop at
[1784.20 → 1791.16] American stores and new egg was just kind of the go-to for so many years but where do you guys
[1791.16 → 1797.96] actually shop now because new egg seems to kind of suck now I'm a little scared I was just
[1797.96 → 1802.84] going to say Amazon oh the first answer was Amazon okay there it is, and the second answer was Amazon
[1802.84 → 1808.52] new egg best buy Amazon micrometer pc part picker is not a store eBay apple okay you guys are just
[1808.52 → 1813.72] trolling the micrometer people came in strong but they also came in late the apple responders
[1813.72 → 1820.76] are faster which is concerning oh it's probably that apple should benchmark our fans
[1824.04 → 1829.72] do human benchmark but for people that are fans of different things and just see who the better
[1829.72 → 1834.92] fan bases are this is not singable what are you even what are you doing right now of NVIDIA fans
[1834.92 → 1842.68] versus AMD fans versus intel fans and see who the best fans are what about the AI o fans no stop okay
[1842.68 → 1846.44] that's a thing that's a thing that's what that's the that's a joke I thought you were making I don't
[1846.44 → 1851.64] get to ding myself no, no you have that is a privilege for Linus and you no you have to ding it all right
[1851.64 → 1859.24] I get the sanding oh you just muted it and then dinged it yeah that's rude that was awful that was so deep
[1859.24 → 1866.04] that was rude to the audience there you go there you go good job using the dumb so what would I buy
[1866.04 → 1874.84] for 250 bucks I mean realistically the arc b580 is the only reasonable choice it's not 250 unfortunately
[1874.84 → 1880.92] but it is 250 MSRP which means realistically the 50 50 is probably going to come in at around a similar
[1880.92 → 1888.12] price this thing is just such a winner as long as you have a PCI Express gen 4 motherboards so you're not
[1888.12 → 1894.20] stuck at eight lanes at gen 3 speed and we I mean it's been a hot minute, but we did do videos on how
[1894.20 → 1901.80] to make a little bit more cash you can legitimately go mow some lawns you are not seriously referring to
[1901.80 → 1908.52] the blueberry selling video are you no the did too it was part of the same series yeah uh Linus summer
[1908.52 → 1913.80] job is that what did we are that what we called it oh my god yeah there they are by laptop there they are
[1913.80 → 1922.12] we did summer job mowing lawns can you earn a laptop summer job selling berries laptop or bust episode
[1922.12 → 1932.12] two man 800 000 views the mowing lawns one did okay it actually did kind of okay I mean for something
[1932.12 → 1940.52] eight years ago it has no idea was this that was me I think oh I like it dude we had little branded
[1940.52 → 1949.32] shirts i know I wish I still had my shirts from this series MO grass MO problems it was so good
[1951.00 → 1959.08] it was so good why is this the most replayed part okay because we're coming back oh people are skipping
[1959.08 → 1966.20] the sponsor spot I think yeah okay but what happened here is this the yard that they finally agreed to let
[1966.20 → 1974.36] me what okay what was that thumbnail I don't know dude what a weird video going door to door man it
[1974.36 → 1980.04] that part sucked that part is terrible hopefully you know some people in your neighbourhood that'll
[1980.04 → 1988.04] make it a little less weird oh dude door-to-door sales is an amazing way what is that where did that come
[1988.04 → 1993.40] to acclimate to rejection oh no uh it was what someone at the door said I can't come to the door I'm naked
[1993.40 → 2002.04] got it wild I also found like I legitimately did this when I was a kid I find it's a lot less awkward
[2004.20 → 2008.52] I don't know why what door-to-door sales when if you're trying to like door-to-door sales like can I mow your lawn
[2008.52 → 2017.16] and you're like 12 oh, oh yeah oh dude it's so easy dude not only yeah people like want to do it being a little girl is like op
[2017.16 → 2026.92] okay my my daughters got like fundraiser chocolate bars okay they got fundraiser chocolate bars
[2028.20 → 2029.64] okay when I was a kid
[2032.92 → 2039.32] sorry keep going when I was a kid okay whenever I got like fundraiser stuff dude i I could have walked for
[2039.32 → 2049.40] miles and like struggled to sell like you know bars or whatever right dude we walked like one block
[2049.40 → 2055.24] and they blew through like 30 chocolate bars like every house bought like two or three I have like this
[2055.24 → 2063.00] is ridiculous i all you have to do to kill it as a door-to-door salesman is be a little girl
[2063.00 → 2066.12] yeah
[2068.44 → 2069.96] and they have ways these days
[2072.04 → 2072.36] uh
[2072.36 → 2074.36] uh
[2074.36 → 2074.52] uh
[2076.28 → 2081.88] wow I had a thing that I was going to say I really did oh right I keep changing my car
[2082.52 → 2087.88] because I have a rule that if there's like the same car you've always had yeah oh keep changing your car
[2087.88 → 2094.12] uh I have a rule that if I drive past a lemonade stand I have to like to stop that's pretty cool usually
[2094.12 → 2099.16] I did you get lemonade when we saw that place yeah nice I was thinking about it and then I was lazy
[2099.16 → 2106.76] yeah i I like have to fairly recently I was driving around with Emma, and we saw a lemonade stand and
[2106.76 → 2112.84] we were not in my car we were in her car and there was no change and no cash there was no way to
[2112.84 → 2118.28] like buy the lemonade, and it like actually genuinely ruined my day I'm not even kidding
[2118.28 → 2125.00] because I remember sitting on the corner with rich my brother trying to sell lemonade when we were like
[2125.00 → 2130.20] 10 because we were trying to save up for a SNES and I remember people driving by and thinking like
[2130.20 → 2134.92] man and then there was I think I've even told you this story there was one dude and I think it was
[2134.92 → 2141.00] like a jeep or something with his girlfriend and he stopped by and was just like super cool
[2141.00 → 2146.20] just like sup guys like he's telling yeah, and he gave us like way more money than made sense for the
[2146.20 → 2150.52] lemonade we gave him extra lemonade, and he was just like see ya and took off and I was like I want to be
[2150.52 → 2156.76] that guy that's pretty cool that's who I want to be that's what i have paid his coolness forward
[2156.76 → 2160.92] and will ideally do so forever I like it, I like it, I respect it yeah
[2165.16 → 2168.36] so we're talking what we're talking about overpriced graphics cards um yes
[2168.36 → 2177.88] yes Dan what's next help us out here because we're yeah please safe us, we've drifted thank you
[2177.88 → 2184.12] okay do the other thing if you can even explain properly oh merch messages stop talking to me
[2184.92 → 2194.28] merch messages boys it's a good week to send a merch message three years here we go
[2194.28 → 2202.68] oh it's finally ready three years and countless revisions later
[2205.48 → 2210.20] it's finally here I want one so let's watch the video we're going to watch the video are you ready for
[2210.20 → 2214.92] the video I'm ready for the video I'm ready to relive my old memories with an oh wait what just happened
[2214.92 → 2219.72] three more years to make it transparent no, no start over I missed the beginning okay, okay
[2219.72 → 2226.12] transparent this screwdriver took three years to develop, and it took three more years to make it
[2226.12 → 2234.20] transparent cool so good we always knew we wanted to transfer so we started working on it at the same
[2234.20 → 2240.44] time as the original but one problem the plastic we used for the original cannot be clear so we had to
[2240.44 → 2246.20] find a new plastic to make the transparent screwdriver with, and we did fortunately it was around the same
[2246.20 → 2251.08] time we were having ratchet issues after switching manufacturers it helped us peer inside the
[2251.08 → 2257.16] mechanism and diagnosed the root cause of the issues we were having, but it was brittle as
[2258.36 → 2263.56] so it was back to the drawing board and this is where we stumbled on triton a plastic used by some of
[2263.56 → 2269.08] the world's most popular water bottles and while more durable it does present its own set of challenges
[2269.08 → 2273.88] it would harden the mould way faster than we would like and this leads to massive imperfections in the
[2273.88 → 2279.08] plastic this also meant that part ejection was a flipping nightmare parts would not come off of our
[2279.08 → 2284.44] moulds without cracking damaging or flying off into freaking outer space and because of the difference
[2284.44 → 2289.24] in thickness between the top and bottom of our handle any handle made with this plastic would have welded
[2289.24 → 2295.96] lines all over it not only did we have to make the plastic flow faster into the mould by expanding the
[2295.96 → 2302.60] entry points we had to change the end cap mould and make the flow more even from top to bottom of the
[2302.60 → 2308.20] handle we didn't want to just make new moulds that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars but with a
[2308.20 → 2313.96] little bit of SolidWorks and a few modifications to our moulds we could do it for a lot less all we
[2313.96 → 2319.24] have to do is replace these parts, and we're ready to make a transparent screwdriver it may be clear now
[2319.80 → 2327.00] but getting here was anything but I'm excited to finally get this into your hands lttstore.com
[2327.00 → 2337.40] hell yeah that was cool yeah they did a great job of that and everything kyle said was right man there
[2337.40 → 2345.48] were multiple times when we thought you know what forget it this just isn't worth it is like how can it be
[2345.48 → 2352.28] how can it be this much bloody work just to you know fire a different plastic into a stupid
[2352.28 → 2358.92] hunk of metal thing to make the bloody shape and if we weren't so obsessive about things like those
[2358.92 → 2366.04] weld lines we could have been done ages ago they didn't actually impact the structural rigidity
[2366.04 → 2371.96] of the screwdriver or anything like that didn't look well what they looked like what they
[2371.96 → 2378.12] looked like was a scratch an imperfection yeah or a crack yeah and if anybody got this thing and it
[2378.12 → 2382.92] had a crack in it, they'd be like I already have a butt I don't need more things with cracks in them
[2386.12 → 2391.96] no that's not don't even don't even it's not worth if it's not worth it that does not get dinged um
[2391.96 → 2395.64] question there's been a few of these questions in float plane chat for sure hit me so we figured out
[2395.64 → 2405.88] the material triton it's clear fantastic I love it I want one purple um clear purple there's no point
[2405.88 → 2411.88] hiding the fact that obviously we thought of that yeah right like obviously you kind of have to
[2411.88 → 2419.64] there's I mean look we had come up with the SNES the retro excuse me the retro driver as
[2419.64 → 2425.16] well as the Noctua editions before anyone ever suggested them publicly yeah yeah yeah and those
[2425.16 → 2430.68] were not the only things that we came up with in our brainstorming sessions and one of the ones
[2430.68 → 2437.64] that we obviously thought of was throwback n64 clear transparent plastic colours yeah I think they
[2437.64 → 2444.52] call it atomic purple you can call it legally distinct like nuclear purple so look I'm not
[2444.52 → 2451.24] going to deny that we've thought of it and now that we have a clear plastic base I'm not going to deny
[2451.24 → 2457.00] that the chances that such a thing could exist are higher than they were before we had a working clear
[2457.00 → 2462.28] plastic this would have to sell decently well however well okay that but I wasn't even I hadn't
[2462.28 → 2468.20] even gotten there yet so this has to be a commercial success before you see any more clear colours and
[2468.20 → 2474.68] number two is that once you add the dye you can change the flow characteristics again
[2477.48 → 2486.36] yeah okay so if everything goes great, and we don't have to do three years of
[2486.36 → 2493.32] mould tuning again then obviously we'd love to do it, but that's not a guarantee right now yeah yeah
[2493.32 → 2499.24] right now the product we have for sale is the transparent screwdriver uh should we do a little
[2499.24 → 2504.84] unboxing do you want to do an unboxing yeah here you go your very own screwdriver yeah go for it oh it's
[2504.84 → 2510.04] mine I mean it is now taking it home uh you could, I mean you could try holding it up into the frame so
[2510.04 → 2517.80] people can at least see it oh good lord uh cute box design right yeah shout out Sarah and her team
[2518.84 → 2525.08] actually I think our packaging game is like so much better than it was back in the back in the day
[2525.96 → 2533.00] well there we go you get the Ltd card yeah heck yeah it shows off our bit sets yep what's the QR code
[2533.00 → 2539.24] for I don't know ah leave a review cool that makes sense heck yeah you get your bit load out is it like
[2540.60 → 2545.80] oh it's a gradient I see I was like okay yes, and you can actually like see through it too which is
[2545.80 → 2552.76] pretty cool there's not like I mean the box is cool and stuff, but it's its it's sort of right there yeah
[2552.76 → 2559.56] I mean look personally I've always been pretty minimalist when it comes to packaging yeah I don't like
[2559.56 → 2564.92] spending a ton of money on something that people are going to immediately throw away um but the
[2564.92 → 2569.56] team is always kind of pushing back on me for you know hey presentation matters and I think we've
[2569.56 → 2575.88] found a good middle ground there's no waste in there all of that is recyclable yeah and I think it looks
[2575.88 → 2581.96] great I think they do a really great job of the presentation of the product um when you open the box
[2581.96 → 2586.76] absolutely I do like that it's like very like if I put it all back in here
[2588.20 → 2593.16] it's its just right there it's just right there no they do a really great job anyway it's available
[2593.16 → 2599.08] now at leg.GG transparent screwdriver I know I mentioned this I think last week or whenever the
[2599.08 → 2603.80] last time we looked at it was but being able to look like that at the bits that are inside is
[2603.80 → 2610.44] actually awesome hold on Luke cam I like it so that I know if there's any missing exactly I mean for
[2610.44 → 2614.20] Sony reasons super useful you can know whether to be triggered or not this had another set in it we
[2614.20 → 2617.72] have a bunch of different bit sets you might have more than just one that fits in the screwdriver
[2617.72 → 2621.64] being able to check oh is that one that I'm looking for in here is kind of nice without popping
[2621.64 → 2626.44] it out every time even though that's kind of fun on its own right yeah no they uh they absolutely
[2626.44 → 2631.08] killed it on this thing I'm I'm so excited to finally bring this to market because we've had like
[2631.08 → 2637.96] kyle said we've had transparent screwdrivers since before we launched the original screwdriver
[2637.96 → 2642.20] but they were just made of a plastic that was so brittle that we couldn't launch it
[2642.84 → 2647.48] and uh like he said that it was with the transparent selector rings that we were actually able to
[2647.48 → 2651.48] diagnose the issues we had with the ratchets that were delaying the launch of the solid colour
[2651.48 → 2658.84] screwdriver so transparent was beneficial to us both in terms of the coolness factor and in terms of the
[2658.84 → 2665.72] legitimate aid that it gave us in our product development it is can we get close enough that people can see that
[2665.72 → 2673.24] uh I don't know you'd have to be like it's a good question indeed actually here you know what yes
[2673.24 → 2677.24] we can but I'll have to get up, and you'll have to talk through it no, no Dan you're I don't need to focus
[2677.96 → 2680.36] focus oh Lord oh here
[2684.52 → 2687.32] okay so uh it's pretty dark
[2687.32 → 2696.04] so are you showing it changing with the selector switch or whatever oh yeah you can't really see
[2696.04 → 2701.00] it super well in person you can see it very clearly but like when you rotate it back and
[2701.00 → 2705.48] forth to either make it so that it's twist right or twist left or neutral where it's fixed, and it's not
[2705.48 → 2711.56] really ratcheting any more you can see the selector switch change for that again due to our lighting and
[2711.56 → 2716.20] the camera setup you can't really I mean you've got like the blank white bit showing right now no, no
[2716.20 → 2721.40] that's not blank that's the little uh that's the little spring-loaded dude that gives it the feel
[2721.40 → 2727.48] okay so yeah he's showing uh the the the like haptic feedback of changing the switch right there's
[2727.48 → 2733.48] a little metal uh spring-loaded thing that you can feel now this is the part you really can't see that
[2733.48 → 2740.12] well uh, but that's the rocker so when you change it to twist left or turn or twist right or the neutral
[2740.12 → 2745.24] position you can see it turning there we go yeah, yeah so you can see like a paddle in their kind of
[2745.24 → 2751.48] flipping to either side and then there's also on the function that one serves um is
[2751.48 → 2757.56] that's the reverse mechanism so one of the things that we modified in our ratchet one of the things
[2757.56 → 2764.44] that LTT screwdriver haters love to say is that it's just a mega pro screwdriver yeah it's not their
[2764.44 → 2771.80] ratchet goes the other way and part of what we did was keeping the profile of it the same so that it
[2771.80 → 2780.12] still fits in this uh tiny space, but it has that reverse mechanism so that our ratchet goes the direct
[2780.12 → 2787.40] so when you turn the screw this way you flip the ratchet the same way instead of it being opposite um
[2788.44 → 2792.68] all while staying slim that was one of the things we did and then also the like the tactile feedback on
[2792.68 → 2796.84] the little spring-loaded dude at the back that was really hard to fine tune and then you
[2796.84 → 2800.60] were going to say when you keep rotating sorry yeah there's one more thing you guys couldn't see which
[2800.60 → 2806.20] is as you're actually ratcheting you can see the little the thing that is making the click you can
[2806.20 → 2811.40] see it flap yes you can as it uh as it goes through the teeth yeah which is actually like pretty cool
[2811.40 → 2814.84] here hold on lets uh let's try it let's try and get that that's worth capturing it's hard to
[2814.84 → 2823.96] it's hard to see, but it is genuinely pretty cool I think that's sweet I love i just really like being
[2823.96 → 2827.72] able to see because when it mentioned like it helped them diagnose the mechanism I was like what
[2828.36 → 2831.64] oh there we go oh yeah yeah that works
[2834.60 → 2834.84] yeah
[2839.00 → 2841.64] and then I think if you go the other way it's the one on the other side right
[2841.64 → 2846.28] you'd have to change the direction but I think it's the one on the other side
[2850.76 → 2853.16] I think it's all the way over on the other side of the white piece
[2856.28 → 2857.72] oh oh oh oh
[2863.16 → 2865.96] not there yeah there we go
[2865.96 → 2871.88] yeah you can see it moving there you go there you go there you go it's a little hard to capture
[2871.88 → 2877.24] on camera, but it is extremely obvious, and he's the same person this is a consistent issue
[2880.44 → 2888.20] but yeah it looks awesome very cool that's wicked someone asked if the is it feels the same
[2888.20 → 2893.88] yeah um it do I think it feels the same to me or at least very similar as the same it has the
[2893.88 → 2898.68] profile is the same it comes out of the same mould we made modifications to the mould they're saying does
[2898.68 → 2907.16] the plastic result in a different hand feel no because the plastic um the plastic hand feel is from the EDM
[2907.16 → 2913.72] texturing technique that we do on the inside of the mould so that roughness is intentional
[2913.72 → 2923.48] and the slight sort of blasted look and feel of it okay it's very intentional it could be
[2923.48 → 2930.20] completely glassy clear smooth if our mould was completely smooth, but we found that this level
[2930.20 → 2935.72] of roughness and and and texture was a little bit nicer for grip on the hand grip yeah yeah not a ton
[2935.72 → 2939.88] of grip it's not the grippiest screwdriver in the world I'm not going to pretend that it is, but it adds
[2939.88 → 2946.36] a just little bit of a little bit a little bit to it is will probably you know what I'm not going
[2946.36 → 2950.12] to guarantee what will happen over time but what I have seen is the solid colour ones have tended to
[2950.12 → 2955.40] smooth out with after extreme oh so you think that might also happen I don't know I'm not I don't know
[2955.40 → 2962.28] I will say nothing I will say nothing no guarantee glad you guys like it is seems like people are uh
[2962.28 → 2971.08] seems like people are super, super into it uh, but that's not all we also have the transparent
[2971.80 → 2977.24] collection oh my okay these are actually pretty cool do you want to read out the thing while i
[2977.24 → 2981.72] while I put them on uh sure also before a question before I start reading that is there going to be a
[2981.72 → 2990.44] transparent stubby uh well if the full size which is our best-selling screwdriver if the full size is a
[2990.44 → 2997.56] huge success then who knows there could be a stubby it could happen i would never say that for
[2997.56 → 3003.16] certain it would not happen, but we do have to evaluate our products based on their potential
[3003.16 → 3008.76] for commercial success and the transparent screwdriver will be the major indicator
[3008.76 → 3014.44] for whether we will see other colours of transparent assuming that technically it is feasible
[3014.44 → 3020.04] and whether we will see other designs in transparent yeah uh the rest of the blurb we have
[3020.04 → 3027.16] two brand-new print order designs inspired by the theme of transparency the x-ray vision officer zip
[3027.16 → 3032.92] up hoodie which is not the first one he's starting with so I will switch what I'm saying and the core
[3032.92 → 3040.20] no, no no, no yes I'll start with that one uh featuring the x-ray vision officer zip-up hoodie uh featuring an
[3040.20 → 3045.56] x-ray of your favourite chief vision officer and his or at least his teeth it's you
[3045.56 → 3053.48] who taken directly from where we got his wisdom teeth pulled improved with three thousand five
[3053.48 → 3059.88] hundred dollars worth of headgear I saw it on set before we got here I didn't realize it was your head
[3061.80 → 3067.08] you can see um uh hold on yeah what is the three thousand five hundred dollars to the head is that a
[3067.08 → 3075.48] VR headset it's an apple vision pro oh that's funny so we ct scanned the apple vision pro I should
[3075.48 → 3081.88] have seen the earrings I see it now there are the earrings right here oh man I get it now and then
[3081.88 → 3090.04] those are my actual like dental scans it's funny because I had the idea when I was company is so weird
[3090.04 → 3096.36] I had the idea when I was chatting with Lisa who wanted to do like this kind of like cool
[3097.00 → 3103.96] we got the ct scanner we were like oh we should do something with like clear something right and so
[3103.96 → 3111.24] she had the idea of doing like you know it's like a kind of cool skull tech something design and
[3111.24 → 3116.04] uh, and it was like at the last minute I think we'd already kind of like approved it and I was like yo Lisa
[3116.04 → 3123.40] a super weird but like if you guys called like my dentist do you think they'd just like give you my
[3123.40 → 3127.88] x-ray scans and then and then could you like put that into the because obviously that's not
[3127.88 → 3133.96] like my skull head case, or you know whatever right so it's like it's an it's a skull image but
[3133.96 → 3140.76] the dental records and the bits that are me are inserted into it, so those are my teeth oh that's
[3140.76 → 3147.16] funny which is flipping well I can't believe my dentist wait it's not your head case no like
[3147.72 → 3152.76] like we don't we don't have a clean scan of like my the top of my skull because they don't take
[3152.76 → 3157.88] pictures of that when you go to the dentist earrings show up in the dentist they do oh yeah because it's
[3157.88 → 3162.44] it's like this area here, but they don't have like up here there'd be no reason for them to blast my
[3162.44 → 3170.12] brain yeah yeah yeah um narcissist button for what for uh I don't know it doesn't
[3170.12 → 3178.68] doesn't matter I don't know um anyway there's but wait there's more we also have uh and the core
[3178.68 → 3187.24] memory t-shirt featuring a different angle of that x-ray and upgraded with more cool oh okay don't mind
[3187.24 → 3193.16] that the print quality is kind of faded on this it'll be like this one uh, but this is just like
[3193.16 → 3197.72] this is a test one these are print to order so they'll ship in a little while um but yeah here if
[3197.72 → 3204.44] we can get an if we can get a closer look at this one you can actually see you can see the earrings
[3204.44 → 3216.68] and then yep that's my teeth that's my tootsies upgraded with AMD inside of course yeah, so yeah cool right
[3217.64 → 3225.16] I like it yeah I thought uh I thought Lisa did a great job with these all right what else we got
[3225.16 → 3232.04] here anyway all available now at leg.GG transparent collection uh what are we uh
[3233.32 → 3238.12] complicated yeah I think I'll probably leave that alone for now all right what uh what are we supposed
[3238.12 → 3243.72] to do now Dan oh wait we're supposed to explain merch messages yeah yeah yeah if you want to if you
[3243.72 → 3249.00] want to interact with the show all you got to do is hey maybe by picking up a cool transparent
[3249.00 → 3254.84] screwdriver pretty cool or one of the transparent collection hoodies or t-shirts um just go to
[3254.84 → 3260.76] ltdstore.com add something to your cart, and you'll see a little box for a merch message we think merch
[3260.76 → 3268.12] messages are the best flipping way to interact with the show because unlike a twitch boot or a super chat or
[3268.12 → 3275.16] or whatever um you can throw money at your screen with a merch message and even if we don't get to
[3275.16 → 3281.16] your message hey you'll get high quality merchandise in return a kick chair a kick chair a kick
[3281.16 → 3288.84] kick kick and uh sorry what are we talking about anyway the point is that sorry that's a bit
[3288.84 → 3295.24] of a reference to the pre-show or wait I don't even think that was on the pre-show that was just our
[3295.24 → 3303.88] conversation that we had privately anyway the point is leave a merch message in the cart, and it will go to
[3303.88 → 3312.36] producer Dan who will oh my god no, no one's helping you who will reply to your message or will forward
[3312.36 → 3318.84] it to someone internally who can help you or might even curate it for me and Luke to respond to on the
[3318.84 → 3327.64] show somebody linked me this we have a video of it how cool is that it's like someone did cool stuff so
[3327.64 → 3334.52] that's the ratchet reverse yeah I'm sure there's also a video on there of the uh the flappy panel
[3334.52 → 3339.96] Dan do you want to show them how a merch message works yeah sure I've got lots here it's been live
[3339.96 → 3345.56] for about an hour, and we've already got about 300 so I've been doing one every 10 seconds so far uh hey
[3345.56 → 3351.00] DLL excited about the new transparent screwdriver my original all black driver is still kicking and about
[3351.00 → 3357.00] to have a brother question for Luke what experience do you have in the DFI
[3357.64 → 3366.36] DFI I don't know what that is a digital forensics and incidents response what experience do I have
[3367.24 → 3371.72] in digital forensics based on that he wasn't familiar with the term I'm going to say
[3373.32 → 3376.76] not that much cybersecurity things oh well
[3376.76 → 3390.12] uh I mean officially not a lot wink howdy DLL this will be the sixth screwdriver I've gotten after
[3390.12 → 3394.36] your support team sent me a new one I was wondering is there anything that you have bought multiple
[3394.36 → 3402.60] times just because you like it oh yeah almost certainly oh man what am I there 's's got to be
[3402.60 → 3415.64] uh cereal I put not consumables um i just because I like it okay that's the tough part
[3416.52 → 3422.28] just because I like it not because I could use a second one but just because I like it
[3422.28 → 3427.72] I think I have an example okay hit me these shorts
[3432.68 → 3438.84] they're like way too expensive my whole thing is that I don't spend money these particular ones are
[3440.84 → 3447.32] I think 10 years old at this point and I wear literally these particular ones like at least once
[3447.32 → 3455.48] a week, and they still look totally fine they are just tanks okay does this count um I owned a copy
[3455.48 → 3461.80] of Final Fantasy 6 when I was a kid as an adult with I don't even know if I have a working Super Nintendo
[3461.80 → 3469.48] at home I bought a cartridge but is that that's is that more of a collectible that's a collectible
[3469.48 → 3474.12] that's a collectible because I have no intention of actually plugging it into another one because you liked it
[3474.12 → 3482.28] I did I don't know if that counts man I'm trying to think I bought another one just because I like it
[3482.28 → 3488.52] yeah the tall boy shirt like I buy multiple that's I consider clothing almost a consumable but I've bought
[3488.52 → 3496.76] like seven of the exact same one okay tell me this NPC I bought five pairs of yonex's uh 65 w
[3496.76 → 3506.04] x2 shoes, but it's because I'm going to go through them and depending on their product refresh cycle
[3506.04 → 3512.60] sometimes they don't have a wide fit so I just stocked up on them does that count as buying more because I like them
[3512.60 → 3516.68] I think the problem with my shorts your shoes my shoes
[3518.52 → 3524.76] we're treating a thing that isn't generally seen as a consumable as a consumable we like it so much that we're oh badminton shoes are very consumable
[3524.76 → 3530.36] consumable because of the strain from all the lunging like dude oh yeah that makes sense I should show you
[3530.36 → 3535.88] what the insides of my badminton shoes look like they get scuffed like on the inside the bottoms are
[3535.88 → 3540.68] fine because you're playing on like a rubber course is there an example of something that wouldn't wear out
[3542.20 → 3550.84] that I bought another one just because I like it man it doesn't wear out it's not consumed yeah like I'd buy
[3550.84 → 3555.88] one of something just because I like it, you know what I own more Xbox controllers than I need
[3556.44 → 3563.64] just because I like them like I bought that for that's acceptable not always so I bought that one
[3563.64 → 3570.36] the project scarlet one that was given out to the developers of the I believe the Xbox Series X on
[3570.36 → 3575.80] topic you have a transparent one that looks sick I do I saw it at your place the other day I do it looks
[3575.80 → 3580.76] awesome it's pretty cool i kind of like immediately wanted one because I don't know what transparency
[3580.76 → 3585.56] is cool, but it's uh yeah I don't know I don't have that might be on the collection side of things with
[3585.56 → 3590.20] all this stick drift people are saying Xbox controllers are kind of consumable
[3591.88 → 3598.52] oh yeah I'm not oh I can't even tell you your wrong brother I can't even tell you're wrong no
[3598.52 → 3607.88] oh Lord just because I like it, I feel like we're putting too many caveats on it
[3609.32 → 3615.24] hmm well their example was the screwdriver which has a utility to it but is not something that you
[3615.24 → 3621.56] would expect to like die yeah there's probably there's probably tools that I own more than one
[3621.56 → 3625.08] of but I wouldn't say that it's ever happened just because I like it but if you're going to get more
[3625.08 → 3628.28] than one of these you would probably get different versions and at that point are you collecting
[3629.16 → 3634.04] I think so I okay in that case I think my Xbox controller counts yeah because this could
[3634.04 → 3638.84] conceivably wear out that was the direction I was going in it could be collectible like an Xbox
[3638.84 → 3643.48] controller would, but realistically you can only game with one controller at a time you can only screw
[3643.48 → 3650.12] with one screwdriver at a time well you know unless you're in inside out compression
[3651.00 → 3658.04] yeah um middle middle middle out that's right that's right um I'm going to go with I'm
[3658.04 → 3662.76] going to go with Xbox controllers it's really stupid and I actually don't care that much but I have a
[3662.76 → 3668.36] bit of a weak spot for cool game controllers Xbox controllers i also have a that cool um
[3668.36 → 3673.24] spider-man PS5 controller I like the Gears of War Xbox controllers I've always liked those yep
[3674.68 → 3681.48] I'm not even that into Gears of War but I really like the controllers German says children yeah i I did like
[3681.48 → 3686.84] I did like my children so I got another one yeah that happened yeah I don't buy them though I don't
[3686.84 → 3692.04] buy them i just there are other ways he rents it's Vancouver we'll explain it to you, we'll explain it to
[3692.04 → 3698.28] you when you're older I might, it might be a little warm for me to wear a hoodie right now let's throw
[3698.28 → 3704.36] another one in here just because we have sure a couple dear dynast duke and LAN I work in the defence
[3704.36 → 3710.20] industry working as a senior engineer trying to push teams to embrace new tech what are your experiences you've had
[3710.20 → 3717.56] to trying to modernize how people work looks I knew i I knew Luke would have this reaction
[3720.36 → 3727.32] you want to take this one yeah I'm going to take it off a long walk off a short fear
[3729.64 → 3737.24] do you have any thoughts Stan I haven't thought how much how is it trying to most of my brain is just whiskey
[3737.24 → 3745.64] so Dan has been trying to pick the wrong month to stop huffing glue at Linus media group
[3745.64 → 3755.24] incorporated we use Office 365 Google Workspace slack uh Trello monday.com asana Reich
[3756.44 → 3764.92] Miró uh jot from google forms google calendar Google Drive PowerPoint one drive
[3764.92 → 3774.76] uh raw word documents uh some people use uh what's that thing called there's obsidian and then
[3774.76 → 3781.40] there's also the other one and I don't remember the name of and people use both of them uh notepad
[3781.96 → 3787.80] uh any anything you could possibly notion there we go thank you uh people you use anything you could
[3787.80 → 3794.92] possibly imagine that has a Trello or an uh text input kanban board on it and anything you could
[3794.92 → 3799.16] possibly imagine that has a text input and anything you could possibly imagine that has a calendar in my
[3799.16 → 3806.84] meeting with Sarah who I am going to call out here pretty hard uh-oh in my meeting with Sarah she was
[3806.84 → 3817.88] taking meeting notes in illustrator that is so based Luke let's put that on our sop that's kind of sick
[3817.88 → 3828.84] it's vector based lossless notes she'll never lose them uh so Dan uh through a series of events
[3828.84 → 3837.80] ended up um trying to unify a lot of that through an another service 15 hey there are too many standards
[3837.80 → 3849.08] let's add another one uh called air table um, and it went flawlessly yeah okay in fairness to the people
[3849.08 → 3854.12] who were being asked to modernize their workflows no problems sometimes there might have been
[3854.12 → 3860.12] some issues with the workflows and I'm not gonna I'm not going to attach blame to any particular party
[3860.12 → 3865.96] um I have personally found some bugs that maybe they were maybe they could have been predicted maybe
[3865.96 → 3874.60] they couldn't have um so i i I think that rolling out new workflows and new tools can be a challenge on
[3874.60 → 3880.52] both sides there are entire companies that you can come contract in for hundreds of thousands of maybe
[3880.52 → 3888.60] over a million dollars to help you do uh to manage change uh, and it's tough, and some people do better
[3888.60 → 3896.44] with it and some people don't, and it's part of the process, and it's painful heck yeah let's go
[3897.48 → 3904.44] heck yeah so yeah it sucks and that was I mean this is a very dramatic very difficult version because
[3904.44 → 3910.04] we just did everything this isn't like getting the writers to change from word to google docs
[3911.48 → 3917.72] had pain involved yeah but like was fine no that was not that bad because it's not a huge deal yeah
[3917.72 → 3926.76] that and like Google Docs in time has gotten um has gotten a lot more usable it wasn't that pleasant to
[3926.76 → 3932.92] work in except for search has gotten worse the search company doesn't seem to be able to do search
[3932.92 → 3939.24] anymore I know I'm seriously considering switching to duck go just to get away from AI summaries some of the default
[3939.24 → 3945.00] sorting to sorting by relevance will like uh I was it you that I was talking to when I was showing
[3945.00 → 3950.76] that screenshot of my search results in my inbox I was searching for like flight or something like
[3950.76 → 3957.48] that dude, and it didn't have my most recent one that was marked on red but had like old like ticket
[3957.48 → 3962.84] itineraries and stuff like what are you duck go has AI summaries oh wow I didn't know that i
[3962.84 → 3966.60] actually did not know that either welcome to current year maybe you can turn them off or something yeah
[3966.60 → 3973.00] there's no escape um yeah dude i I constantly get flack because i I'll be like hey can you like link me
[3973.00 → 3978.36] that doc that you have open, and they'll be like oh you're shared on it oh my god like no that makes
[3978.36 → 3985.40] me scream sure but I can't find it can you just link it to me, I need the link it's its not going to come up
[3985.40 → 3990.60] then I will literally search for the title of the document in my Google Drive and then show them my
[3990.60 → 3996.60] laptop and be like i I believe you that I'm shared on it but like i it I cannot find it
[3998.28 → 4003.88] I don't know speaking of not being able to find things or speaking of AI summaries on the modern
[4003.88 → 4010.36] internet let's talk about house fresh highlighting more issues with the modern internet if you're not
[4010.36 → 4015.88] familiar with house fresh uh they were featured very prominently in this video on our channel this
[4015.88 → 4022.12] week that uh gained a little bit of momentum and I think really resonated with the audience in a big
[4022.12 → 4027.80] way great video by the way uh oh yeah, thank you I thought Elijah and the house fresh team did a
[4027.80 → 4035.48] tremendous job it's fantastic in a nutshell house fresh reviews uh air purifiers, and they ended up
[4035.48 → 4043.88] embroiled in some legal trouble over accusations that they were treating a particular brand unfairly
[4043.88 → 4051.88] and we kind of dig into we talked to house fresh we talked to the brand that uh is has been legally
[4051.88 → 4062.20] involved with them and dug as best as we could to find the full story anyway what we kind of the
[4062.20 → 4068.92] conclude the basic conclusion that we came to is that companies suing independent reviewers over
[4068.92 → 4077.72] results that they don't like or agree with is not good yeah and not going to be tolerated and just days
[4077.72 → 4087.24] later house fresh highlighted another issue with modern trying to be a reviewer that could be a major
[4087.24 → 4094.12] problem so it's actually this tweet right here that prompted me to flag this for the wan show crew
[4094.76 → 4102.20] what they're calling the great decoupling and I'll get into a little bit of the more uh detailed bits
[4102.20 → 4109.16] in a second here but what you're looking at here is clicks versus impressions so obviously impressions
[4109.16 → 4114.92] would be the bigger number over here and clicks would be the number over here, so impressions are purple
[4114.92 → 4121.32] and clicks are blue and even when they were like shadow-banned in google these numbers track together
[4121.32 → 4126.44] your impressions go way down, so your clicks go way down and then there was a recovery but then ever
[4126.44 → 4134.60] since about February of this year there's been this um this phenomenon that has been accelerating
[4134.60 → 4139.88] called the great decoupling when instead of these things mostly tracking up and down together
[4139.88 → 4148.68] they now have a very substantial spread between them and the culprit appears to be
[4150.12 → 4155.40] um AI summaries so here I'll, I'll read through the thing so they showed the difference between
[4155.40 → 4160.52] impressions and clicks that are growing farther apart mainly due to AI overview results in google
[4161.16 → 4169.72] um so instead of search engines referring people to the original source material from which they got
[4169.72 → 4176.44] their information they're basically just scraping the page spitting that back out to whoever searching
[4176.44 → 4183.40] for it and then no longer referring anybody through to the original source which means no ad revenue
[4183.40 → 4189.40] no revenue whatsoever because it means death it's not like they're paying licensing fees for this content
[4189.40 → 4194.84] I mean we talked last week about what this is going to mean for news organizations but you know I guess
[4194.84 → 4198.76] you could actually probably kind of classify house fresh the same way I mean it's
[4199.64 → 4207.00] news kind of about how good a particular product is okay it's not quite news but I think you guys can
[4207.00 → 4214.68] understand the parallels here and the impact that it would have on a news organization and also on a review organization
[4215.64 → 4215.96] um
[4215.96 → 4218.04] um
[4218.60 → 4220.04] our discussion question here
[4221.56 → 4223.16] is like what do
[4225.08 → 4230.52] what does someone like house fresh do how do they survive when they're not getting clicked through
[4230.52 → 4236.52] what would stop google from taking the affiliate revenue even spitting out the AI summary including
[4236.52 → 4242.36] affiliate links because that's that's how someone like a house fresh survives is they objectively test
[4243.24 → 4247.56] as a particular device, and they say hey if you like what you saw here's the affiliate link that's
[4247.56 → 4251.96] how they make their money there's a couple of people in full plane chat saying how do you even how do you
[4251.96 → 4258.68] know it's definitely the AI summary is having this effect what else changed and like have you analyzed how
[4258.68 → 4266.68] you use the internet these days like this is a is an extremely palpable change I'm honestly surprised
[4266.68 → 4270.60] it hasn't caused more of an effect like i that's uh
[4273.80 → 4280.60] i yeah I don't know people change the also all the time yeah, and you can go back through the history of
[4281.80 → 4287.40] also changes and watch that those two things match each other house fresh is not the only ones talking
[4287.40 → 4293.08] about this and then suddenly it decouples and the change that lines up with it is AI summaries this is
[4293.08 → 4298.20] like I don't know man I don't know how much more you need what is this going to mean for the lab
[4299.56 → 4303.16] uh this isn't mean anything new for the lab because I knew this the whole time
[4305.00 → 4309.08] pretty much we've talked about this pretty extensively in the past how the direction AI was
[4309.08 → 4313.88] going at the end of the day you were just going to ask your LLM you know hey what computer should I
[4313.88 → 4319.40] buy, and it'll scrape the crap out of our results and all we can really do is create formats that are more
[4319.40 → 4323.64] engaging than interacting with an AI chatbot and I think that's something that we have a lot of good
[4323.64 → 4328.84] ideas for how to do, but it will take time
[4332.04 → 4339.08] I know the lab's been going really slow if anything I think our error with the lab was trying to go too
[4339.08 → 4348.76] fast so if we do anything I don't have it with respect to with respect if we do anything around speed it
[4348.76 → 4356.52] will be continued to slow down things have been pretty good it's yeah it's not moving crazy fast
[4356.52 → 4363.80] uh but like Linus said that's by design um I know there was a post on the Subreddit recently
[4365.88 → 4373.32] I lost my like actual official Reddit account really yeah why I can log into it on Geodude
[4373.32 → 4380.04] like on your computer at home or your old computer my old computer, but there's no way to recover the
[4380.04 → 4385.48] account I cannot for the life for some reason it's not in my password manager I have no idea why so
[4385.48 → 4390.12] wait you don't mean you can log into it, you mean you are logged into it it's its session logged yeah
[4390.12 → 4396.12] so i can open my browser go to Reddit and I'm in the account uh-huh, but there's no I can't set a
[4396.12 → 4404.04] password I can't assign an email to it there's no single sign-on that is attached to it is doesn't
[4404.04 → 4410.12] seem to be attached to any email I think like way back on Reddit you could make accounts without
[4410.12 → 4415.56] assigning them to emails and for like privacy reasons I just did that but I can't retroactively
[4415.56 → 4421.64] assign it to an email now and I have no idea what the password is it's not on my password manager
[4421.64 → 4426.76] I have no idea what's going on there so I need to make a new one but I wanted to I wanted to
[4426.76 → 4432.92] respond we have a Reddit contact like we could probably get it sorted out yeah but I wanted to
[4432.92 → 4437.40] respond to that thread but couldn't but anyway there was a thread talking about how the labs is
[4437.40 → 4442.60] is moving slow and what I was going to essentially answer with is yes absolutely and I cannot promise
[4442.60 → 4447.80] it will move faster I can probably promise it will continue to not move faster um, but there is
[4447.80 → 4452.28] really cool plans we're probably going to be doing stuff on it soon we're doing a lot of hiring
[4453.56 → 4458.28] a lot which is i I'm kind of like if we make a video on this there's going to be a bunch of
[4458.28 → 4463.32] blurry people and i was thinking of just having like titles over their heads nice so you can tell
[4463.32 → 4467.96] like what we're hiring and kind of what they're going to be doing, but it's a bunch of people that
[4467.96 → 4474.68] are technically still on like Sims with a little diamond above them um yeah and there 's's some cool
[4474.68 → 4480.28] stuff coming down the pipe too it's uh it's been good it's just speed is not really going to be the
[4480.28 → 4486.44] the name of the game eventually we want to get like when a vertical is up to speed the output of
[4486.44 → 4492.36] reviews within that vertical ideally will be pretty high but the speed of adding new verticals especially
[4492.36 → 4498.12] that is not going to speed up um yeah I'm very happy with where the lab is at right now
[4498.12 → 4507.24] all right well let's talk a little bit more about AI stuff oh after we do our sponsors okay ah dang it
[4507.24 → 4512.92] this topic wait we didn't even finish the announcements I will get to them this topic
[4512.92 → 4521.48] transitions so well into the next topic I wanted to do okay so you and I have kind of seen it coming
[4521.48 → 4526.60] for a long time that AI is just going to be scraping every website and is going to be just making that
[4526.60 → 4537.08] content its own oh um and if anything it looks like if legal precedent is what I understand it to be
[4537.08 → 4545.96] that's going to get easier for AI companies a federal judge in California has ruled that using copyrighted
[4545.96 → 4556.36] books to train AI models is fair use as long as you purchased them but pirated books those are still
[4556.36 → 4564.28] off limits who's the decision sided with anthropic stating that transforming legally bought physical
[4564.28 → 4572.20] books into digital formats for AI training is spectacularly transformative and therefore qualifies
[4572.20 → 4582.92] as fair use here was upheld even though the entire book was copied because the AI model doesn't
[4582.92 → 4588.28] reproduce the book's contents or and this one this is where i kind of go
[4589.88 → 4594.68] or compete with the original work yeah that second part doesn't seem legitimate or true
[4594.68 → 4602.12] at all another key part of the ruling is that converting a legally bought print book into a digital file
[4602.12 → 4608.44] even just for saving space or searchability is itself considered a transformative fair use
[4612.04 → 4617.08] that's interesting that's very interesting to me because every time I ever opened a book
[4617.08 → 4626.12] it said something reproducing this in any form want any form is prohibited by law yeah um
[4626.12 → 4634.04] the judge emphasized that this print to digital conversion is separate from broader LLM training
[4634.04 → 4638.36] and qualifies as fair use for its own reasons
[4640.52 → 4644.20] shall we allow that to sink in for a moment it's very interesting
[4645.72 → 4652.04] our discussion question here is uh is a couple of hypothetical scenarios that i kind of came up with
[4652.04 → 4659.08] um as I was as I was reading this um when I was going through topics for when today if making a digital
[4659.08 → 4665.48] copy of a book you bought is fair use could this apply to backing up Blu-rays then so that I can watch
[4665.48 → 4675.40] them on my Plex on whatever screen and whatever codec that I deem most convenient for myself but my
[4675.40 → 4684.36] understanding is that in certain jurisdictions that is in fact not allowed because just like with a book
[4684.36 → 4690.92] when you buy a movie you are not in fact buying the movie you do not own the movie you are buying a
[4690.92 → 4699.16] license for which that disc is a physical key to use that media in the way that is that it is licensed
[4699.16 → 4705.32] for like for instance, and you can, you cannot like this, and you cannot agree with it and that's totally
[4706.12 → 4711.40] totally your thing go for it, you cannot like it but when you buy a Blu-ray at willow video
[4712.04 → 4719.24] you're not allowed to like to host a public event in a public space and exhibit that Blu-ray you're not
[4719.24 → 4726.52] allowed to rent a commercial a little commercial property set up a big you know buy high senses 110
[4726.52 → 4732.52] inch TV put it in the front get some folding chairs and make a little theatre and then charge people
[4732.52 → 4740.52] admission to see it you are not you do not own a commercial license to that work so to me
[4742.20 → 4750.68] unless you are buying a commercial license for the book I don't see how there I don't see how those two
[4750.68 → 4757.32] things can both be true if that makes sense yeah I'm not saying one is right or one is wrong even
[4757.32 → 4766.36] I have my opinions but what I am saying is that those two things cannot coexist a movie a work of
[4766.36 → 4773.32] creative art being licensed only for personal use and not for reproduction or public display
[4773.88 → 4780.68] and a book that is licensed only for personal use and not for reproduction or public display
[4781.32 → 4787.56] should not have such dramatically different rules applied to them somebody needs to do some prompt
[4787.56 → 4792.36] engineering and get it to output the entire book obviously not at once it won't do that but if you could
[4792.36 → 4797.72] get it to output the entire book like paragraph by paragraph and then prove the output I feel like
[4797.72 → 4803.08] you could dunk this so I had an I had so I had another hypothetical question here so if you were
[4803.08 → 4808.20] gonna, so my understanding is a big part of the argument from the judge is that it doesn't output the entire
[4808.20 → 4815.32] book like you said but here's the thing even if it only output pieces of the book like
[4815.32 → 4825.24] so it's still ingesting it for commercial use and reselling it so my second hypothetical example
[4825.24 → 4833.88] is okay so by that logic could I take that disastrous garbage dumpster fire of a trilogy the hobbit movies
[4835.08 → 4843.88] fan edit them into a single movie and then as long as what I bought three Blu-rays like sell the output
[4845.32 → 4852.04] that's crazy yeah and I'm not saying it's crazy because it's probably perfect yeah I'm not
[4852.04 → 4858.20] saying it's crazy like no one should do it I'd watch the crap out of that oh yeah I'm saying it's crazy
[4858.20 → 4865.08] in the context of copyright law as I understand it at the very least and look I'm not a legal scholar
[4865.64 → 4872.52] what's up when bingo chronicled and full plane chat said holy I just typed read me the first chapter of
[4872.52 → 4877.24] Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone into meta AI, and it actually worked so yeah get it to output
[4877.24 → 4885.24] the whole book over time log the outputs and uh Disney will love that let's blow some stuff up wild
[4886.52 → 4891.80] I think i this is not a question it's a request like I hope that somebody goes through the
[4891.80 → 4897.56] work of doing that um because i I think you just immediately dunk this court case by doing that
[4897.56 → 4906.20] yeah how would it know what the book says well no wait what no if they didn't steal it what
[4907.32 → 4912.44] you haven't heard the topic have you yeah just reproduce the whole thing maybe write a White an eighth one
[4914.68 → 4916.92] Dan eight
[4919.48 → 4923.40] anyway um that's I think all I have to say about that i
[4923.40 → 4927.88] full full full chatter asking if Dan is hallucinating because he's an AI could be
[4929.00 → 4931.24] I can't do m dashes in person it sucks

[5151.24 → 5156.52] a long time was really obvious it was blink 182 for like ever I mean that's that's a that's a pretty
[5156.52 → 5164.04] legit response I think a friend of mine sent me a screenshot uh I was more of an ICP kid, but you know
[5164.04 → 5171.80] blink 182 is value more than I'd probably like to like legitimately yikes they're so sweet they're
[5171.80 → 5180.12] like the best they're the best group of people all right dude I dropped the intro to an ICP song in the
[5180.12 → 5186.20] live stream yesterday just to see if Elijah would have any idea what I was talking about like one person
[5186.20 → 5191.96] in the entire comment section had any idea what I was talking about that is insane yeah that's the least
[5191.96 → 5197.48] thing I was ever going to expect out of your mouth what no I'm not surprised at all ICP he said he's
[5197.48 → 5201.80] yeah he would definitely fit into that crowd yeah he's very sweet I laughed you I did like some
[5201.80 → 5208.68] of their songs uh but yeah blink 182 is my favourite band for like ever um somebody said one of my friends
[5208.68 → 5215.96] sent me a screenshot recently that showed uh what was it like classic music something like that uh on
[5215.96 → 5222.04] like a know song selector thing, and it was blink 182 classic it was something I don't remember
[5222.04 → 5228.28] let me golden oldies let me find it let me figure out exactly what it was I'm old now classic alternative
[5228.28 → 5235.24] like what is yeah let me like what would blink be I'm going to dig it up that's a huge yikes
[5235.24 → 5241.96] it crushed my soul a little bit did he even send it here
[5244.60 → 5249.32] I think people are asking me people are asking me what a juggle is I don't know
[5251.00 → 5256.12] oldies but I do know that he walks through the streets winking at freaks with a two litter stuck in
[5256.12 → 5264.28] his butt cheeks yeah yeah see I remember that line but yeah oldies look uh oh wow all the small things
[5264.28 → 5273.24] oldies wow huge yikes rough um rough all right yeah a lot of oldie stations like the best of the 70s
[5273.24 → 5286.60] 80s 90s and 2000s for all you knew fathers out there remember going to the club Britney Spears toxic
[5286.60 → 5291.64] equals classical music now yeah no I don't think I can handle that Spice Girls I don't think I can handle
[5291.64 → 5300.76] that stop right now thank you very much I don't get a ding for that
[5303.88 → 5307.40] fine I'm still learning the new rubric this is very difficult
[5309.64 → 5313.32] all right do I ding do I not okay what are we supposed to be doing oh merch messages we should
[5313.32 → 5317.32] definitely do some more yeah you want to hit us with some merch messages Dan yeah sure well wait hold
[5317.32 → 5323.32] on a second uh we still haven't done the rest of the announcements uh let's let's do a merch message
[5323.32 → 5328.36] or two first all right hey Dan the man and the other two absolutely love the cargo pants uh have
[5328.36 → 5333.72] you have seen an uptick in sales since the shift fashion review also more colours of the new shorts planned i
[5333.72 → 5339.40] don't think we've seen any uh impact on sales one way or the other since the shift fashion review
[5339.40 → 5345.48] still cool uh yeah yeah I mean like I said it's super neat that we're even in the same conversation as
[5345.48 → 5352.76] like global brands uh I believe that the creator warehouse team has shot their video sort of
[5352.76 → 5358.28] um looking at some of what shift fashion said responding to some of it i I haven't actually
[5358.28 → 5362.76] watched it yet uh I think it's still in the editing queue so that'll be coming up on float plane sometime
[5362.76 → 5369.40] in the next little bit leg.GG float plane, and then it will also be going live on leg clips which is where
[5369.40 → 5376.60] when clips go just so that uh I think the optics of us responding on a paid platform would maybe not
[5376.60 → 5380.20] have been that great so that's fine so we're going to have it available for free I don't know if it'll be
[5380.20 → 5385.24] up on leg clips forever I think a lot of the time when we put exclusives up on leg clips they don't
[5385.24 → 5390.60] stay up forever so i actually literally do not know what the plan is there, but we are going to have
[5391.16 → 5397.88] uh I think the biggest thing is it doesn't like really make sense to be a mainline LCT video but then
[5397.88 → 5402.20] like it doesn't make more sense no like what someone disagrees with me on cotton poly
[5402.20 → 5408.12] blends so we're going to make like a LTT video I don't really see how that's valid our response
[5408.12 → 5415.64] yeah yeah yeah battle of the fabrics I'm sure people would care just maybe not our people
[5415.64 → 5419.80] yeah someone would care someone would care a lot yeah
[5419.80 → 5430.84] sure hey dot DLL can we take a moment to rant about google TV OS why do smart TVs only last a
[5430.84 → 5438.60] couple years bring back the plasma colon capital d period I love the videos and physical products
[5438.60 → 5446.04] keep them uh yeah you know plasmas were like had longevity issues right that was like notoriously
[5446.04 → 5453.56] like that was like the drawback of them yeah other than the cost was it ironic uh were they being a
[5454.36 → 5460.52] funny person I don't think so were they being a city haha they might have been uh if we look at
[5460.52 → 5466.60] context and assume that they're they have all of their brain I'm actually not sure if I agree that
[5466.60 → 5472.68] smart TVs only last a couple of years either though because you can even if you're even if your OS goes out
[5472.68 → 5479.24] of date, or you know gets like kind of laggy and unresponsive most modern smart TVs that I've
[5479.24 → 5484.84] interacted with have a mode where you can set them to fire up just on one of their inputs and then you
[5484.84 → 5492.92] can just get like an android TV box, and then your like can just run that that's how my c2 works yeah I feel
[5492.92 → 5499.72] like TVs have been pretty solid I mean until you break yours that was not me that was not me
[5499.72 → 5505.72] really you're going to throw your so under the bus rather than just take it like a man I also didn't
[5505.72 → 5511.08] say I just said it wasn't me well you're the only two people who live there you're going to throw your
[5511.08 → 5519.08] bird under the bus maybe it was a bird yes maybe a bird ran into it 26 gram budgie managed to
[5519.08 → 5523.80] break your television yeah, but you should have seen the other guy
[5523.80 → 5531.08] one of them one of them got out uh trying to give medicine or something I don't remember what
[5531.08 → 5537.40] was happening but one of them got out in a bathroom, and it kept flying into the mirror lightly
[5537.40 → 5540.68] it didn't have a lot of distance to really get up to speed, but it kept flying into the mirror kind
[5540.68 → 5547.00] of bumping it thinking that it could fly there could it once it landed classic budgie it's all like scared
[5547.00 → 5553.48] and stuff it lands sees itself in a mirror and immediately is like friend hello I'm making
[5553.48 → 5562.52] friends now anyway sorry no one cares it was funny uh one more hey duke Leonard and bread rsvp'd to a
[5562.52 → 5568.60] wedding but found out someone I really dislike is going what should I do go anyway yes the anonymous
[5568.60 → 5575.96] button hasn't worked on a merch message for a while oh yeah these are none of these are anonymous oh wait
[5575.96 → 5581.16] here's one this one's anonymous okay skill issue maybe you could just type the name anonymous but it
[5581.16 → 5588.12] could it could actually be a problem so maybe we can look into it um I don't know what would have
[5588.12 → 5593.40] someone I really dislike is going okay well I do have actually some pretty good advice for this
[5593.40 → 5602.52] that person you dislike don't them oh damn it I mean don't hook up with them at the wedding its good
[5602.52 → 5610.12] advice it's good advice where were you a decade ago yeah see I could have saved you Dan I could
[5610.12 → 5618.76] have saved you thank um okay I ruined a reception more advice okay don't strip down
[5618.76 → 5622.36] don't strip down in the middle of the wedding
[5626.68 → 5630.84] and if you do don't dance don't dance on the table
[5633.80 → 5640.60] okay in all seriousness it's not your day yeah it's the couple's day if they want you there
[5640.60 → 5648.28] then you know what do your best if you absolutely can I mean I don't think it's uh like it like if you
[5648.28 → 5657.56] cannot attend this event without you know fighting this person that then don't go right yeah don't
[5657.56 → 5663.24] don't do anything that would disrupt yes it is not your day it is their day and with that in mind
[5663.24 → 5670.92] it is their day it is not your day if they really want to fight have a pre-written uh in an envelope
[5670.92 → 5674.60] invite to them and if they start making anything hand them the envelope and the envelope are a time
[5674.60 → 5679.72] and place and so if you wanna is is you want to be there to support them because they obviously want
[5679.72 → 5685.08] you there otherwise they wouldn't have sent you an invitation then you should just you could politely
[5685.08 → 5690.12] ask to be seated at a table as far away from this person as the venue allows and unless it's
[5690.12 → 5696.20] the bride and groom yeah yeah yeah ask like a bridesmaid uh or like someone in it's
[5696.20 → 5701.24] one of the groomsmen or something and if that absolutely cannot be accommodated because it's a
[5701.24 → 5705.24] tiny wedding or something like that then you just you have to make the choice that's right for you
[5705.80 → 5711.24] I would recommend if you are not able to attend you know send a like a nicer gift you know at least so
[5711.24 → 5715.80] you can show you were thinking of them you know drop them a note on the day send them a Sand them a
[5715.80 → 5719.96] gift that's kind of on the nicer side uh just make some effort make some effort that's all
[5723.72 → 5725.32] don't be dramatic yeah
[5729.96 → 5735.96] oh sure yeah finish announcements maybe um no what are you doing my job now we're going to get yelled at
[5735.96 → 5741.88] so much sammy just appeared like slender man a second ago so he did what is he still doing here
[5741.88 → 5746.52] he should go home judging you for not doing the announcement on time there's never been a better
[5746.52 → 5754.92] time to subscribe to float plane and here's oh three reasons one ton of amazing content exclusives
[5754.92 → 5762.44] coming up we have an upcoming Linus and taken our CEO interview to mark taken's two-year anniversary on
[5762.44 → 5770.12] July 1st um that dropping the same day oh okay so that's coming out on the same day as his two-year
[5770.12 → 5777.00] anniversary we also have Linus reacts to awkward staff interactions so we shot that ages ago I've
[5777.00 → 5785.40] actually talked about that on wan show that was very uncomfortable for me to for me to watch I was
[5785.40 → 5794.92] watching people describing their first time meeting me and how awkward I was we also have the I spent 24
[5794.92 → 5802.44] hours with Linus in Taiwan fake news the last two are coming out during lime day speaking of lime day
[5802.44 → 5809.64] that's reason number the second flow plane members are going to get 24 hours early access to the deals
[5809.64 → 5816.44] that we will have at ltdstore.com they will be announced next week and that is oh what do you not
[5816.44 → 5823.56] know about this no I know about it, we don't have float plane logging on the global store so okay Luke's
[5823.56 → 5830.60] going to send a quick message yeah we will uh figure out some stuff and finally number three is early
[5830.60 → 5836.44] access to scrapyard wars we don't have a set date for the first episode but like last year each episode
[5836.44 → 5844.36] will be available early on float plane and each episode will contain extras on float plane a basic five
[5844.36 → 5850.12] dollar tier will net you all of these the amazing exclusives already out like the scrapped original
[5850.12 → 5856.92] transparent screwdriver from a year ago what is this scrapped original transparent screwdriver from a
[5856.92 → 5865.40] year ago what am I looking at that's our Shopify one million orders things is this oh, oh yeah okay
[5865.40 → 5872.52] there you go he's doing screwdriver things and I think there was one other thing what is what
[5872.52 → 5879.72] am I looking at Dennis prank extended okay yeah cool uh so that's uh that's a brand-new exclusive
[5879.72 → 5884.60] that just went up uh you can also hang out in the float plane wan chat uh so don't miss out on any of
[5884.60 → 5891.40] this by going to leg.GG slash float plane evil fuzzy asks what about the three dollar OG subscribers yeah
[5891.40 → 5899.40] yeah yeah of course don't worry we got you all right topics you ready for a topic uh yeah
[5899.40 → 5906.68] tesla has launched robot taxi kind of last Sunday tesla launched sort of it's highly anticipated
[5907.88 → 5915.48] uh robot taxi service in Austin Texas this launch included a limited geo-fenced area of Austin that
[5915.48 → 5922.44] has been thoroughly mapped by tesla, and it was available by invite only so we've got a link to
[5922.44 → 5929.24] the geo-fenced area, and then we have a Google Maps link for reference so I'm just going to pull these up
[5929.24 → 5939.96] here and screen share with you guys so here's Google Maps and here is the tesla area and
[5939.96 → 5956.68] oh wow uh is that as small as it looks it's not all of one city oh it's not even close to all of
[5957.24 → 5964.12] one city it's like yeah uh okay what are the city limits what am I even what am I even looking at here
[5964.12 → 5973.48] so here map is wait where's the two where's the 290 okay why am I yeah why am I looking at why am I
[5973.48 → 5982.28] looking at these layers okay, so lake shore boulevard is here uh why am I having such a hard time with this
[5985.00 → 5989.00] did I zoom in on kind of the wrong spot oh I think I might have lost it
[5989.00 → 5997.08] here it is okay I think I got it now so basically it's just along
[6001.32 → 6008.28] it's just along here why is the 35 not labelled here okay what is this one
[6009.08 → 6015.88] is this like 71 or 290 or something what is this okay I'm so confused oh here's the 71 oh okay no it's
[6015.88 → 6018.76] a little bigger it's a little bigger than I thought it's a little bigger than I thought okay
[6018.76 → 6024.76] here we go here we go here we go so the 71 here where it converts to the 290 that's right here there
[6024.76 → 6031.00] we go we've managed to we've managed to map this out here and then it kind of goes up to here and
[6031.00 → 6039.00] kind of to here so it doesn't make its way into rolling wood here so that's wow so it's this
[6039.00 → 6052.28] little chunk of Austin right here cool can we see it I mean that's something you know right that's
[6052.28 → 6058.12] kind of something so if we go to the satellite view yeah I mean oh yeah okay I was
[6058.12 → 6063.80] going to say I mean that's most of the like populous areas but i uh Austin's an Austin's a huge
[6063.80 → 6070.68] uh Austin's a huge city wait this isn't still Austin is it no it can't be how big is Austin
[6073.08 → 6084.04] yeah okay, okay okay, okay uh neat so that's cool um a number of kind of pro tesla influencers received
[6084.04 → 6092.68] invites for the service and tesla has not stated when the service will be available to the public
[6094.12 → 6100.36] the trial includes 10 to 20 model y vehicles that have a robot taxi decal on the side of the vehicle
[6100.92 → 6106.52] and cars included a tesla employed safety monitor in the front passenger seat that can react to
[6106.52 → 6115.00] dangerous situations by pressing an emergency button got it all fares within the service area were set to a
[6115.00 → 6120.76] flat four dollars and twenty cents nice and there are multiple videos of passengers live-streaming their
[6120.76 → 6126.20] experience from start to finish there were some issues with one passenger finding their tesla at
[6126.20 → 6130.68] the pickup location oh there were some issues with passengers finding their teslas at the pickup location
[6131.32 → 6138.04] this is like Pokémon hunting one person on Herbert ONG's live stream said, but it's like robot taxi hunting
[6138.04 → 6142.84] and the riders were asked by the safety monitor to show identification when getting into the vehicle
[6143.48 → 6148.28] once seated the rear scene screen instructs riders to fasten their seat belts and presents a
[6148.28 → 6154.12] start ride button because riders booked the car through the tesla app their preferred music app is
[6154.12 → 6158.76] available on the rear screen with playlists and save tracks that's pretty cool the rear screen also
[6158.76 → 6163.88] includes buttons for support if you ever need assistance or pull over to end the trip early
[6164.68 → 6171.64] most riders described their trips as smooth and uneventful, although there are a few clips where
[6171.64 → 6179.64] less than perfect behaviour was caught so Dan I actually need your help for this bit because we don't want
[6179.64 → 6185.00] to watch these videos on the wan show because that would be rude so what we're going to do instead is
[6185.00 → 6189.48] we're going to link everyone, and we're going to have a little watch party yeah so if you could link them
[6189.48 → 6196.20] to the first one first we're going to start watching together so Luke do you want to load it up sure one sec
[6196.20 → 6205.80] okay and
[6205.80 → 6206.20] and
[6210.36 → 6213.24] ready Luke yep and play
[6215.80 → 6216.04] okay
[6216.04 → 6229.48] oh wow it was going really slow okay so that's what we're supposed to see what so the tesla in the
[6229.48 → 6235.56] left lane is one of the one of the cyber cab teslas oh not the car that's driving okay I was like the
[6235.56 → 6240.36] car that's driving seemed the car that's driving seems to be doing fine but that one in the left lane is
[6240.36 → 6248.92] going like super slow okay got it interesting I mean I would say that that's probably not the end of
[6248.92 → 6253.08] the world as far as things go uh okay number two ready
[6255.96 → 6260.92] and go oh boy I got an ad brilliant
[6260.92 → 6268.76] what happened in this one I'm behind you, it's kind of break slams it seems
[6270.28 → 6275.80] oh wow I don't have audio but I think that's what happened yep just for reasons
[6277.24 → 6283.72] I mean okay again I'd rather if you know stop for reasons um rather than
[6283.72 → 6292.12] accelerate for reasons so that's something um number three is a safety monitor intervening for a
[6292.12 → 6297.64] ups truck that is backing up so we can see uh this is from Dave lee
[6300.04 → 6304.68] and it's going it's going it's going it's going and
[6304.68 → 6313.88] this ups truck is coming here it comes here it comes we're just we're chilling we're chilling
[6315.24 → 6318.76] we're chilling some more we're just going to chill here
[6322.92 → 6325.08] these are the kinds of edge cases though that are
[6325.08 → 6335.80] the reason that i just, but it cuts to the outside when it drives away uh yeah but the safety monitor
[6335.80 → 6340.60] doesn't appear to be in the passenger seat any more there so he's driving uh I'm going to double check
[6341.24 → 6345.24] that's sure what it looks like to me, I'm going to zoom
[6345.24 → 6354.52] I can't see very clearly that's what it appears to be to me and then our
[6354.52 → 6359.48] we've got another one that is definitely parked in a parking spot for drop off
[6363.08 → 6367.40] let's have a look here so that's number four oh wow uh sure
[6369.40 → 6373.88] wow is that a handicapped spot, but it's like not in at all
[6375.24 → 6380.36] I was watching the other one still okay sorry I'm trying to figure out some stuff
[6381.00 → 6388.60] okay, and you know what grand scheme of things these are all pretty these are all pretty small
[6389.88 → 6397.32] issues I'd be interested to see yeah like for the amount of rides that they did and the duration of it
[6397.32 → 6402.36] like what the intervention rate is um and like those types of failures and then look at
[6402.36 → 6408.28] humans driving in the same area for the same amount of time and the types and severity of the
[6408.28 → 6414.28] problems that were caused by them now I do agree I fully expect if we're going to have some robotic
[6414.28 → 6419.16] thing driving I'm not okay with it having the same amount of problems that humans have especially
[6419.16 → 6425.48] because like something has to be responsible and all that kind of stuff yeah um but I am still interested
[6425.48 → 6427.24] just purely in what those stats are
[6433.32 → 6439.00] charge nuclei 8300 says robot taxi is allowed to use handicap parking the driver has no legs
[6440.12 → 6449.24] or head that's pretty good okay that makes sense that makes sense um discussion question yeah would
[6449.24 → 6454.60] you use a service like this in a well-mapped area do you think there is opportunity for this to work
[6454.60 → 6463.40] in a busy or challenging environment Waymo okay but let's okay, okay let's maybe let's not I'm going
[6463.40 → 6470.36] to tweak the discussion question a little bit because Waymo very clearly has the lead here yes they are
[6470.36 → 6478.28] actually operating um unsupervised and when you factor in how few of these cyber cabs are actually roaming
[6478.28 → 6484.28] the streets in this very limited geographical area and then if you look at the tweet of the like launch
[6484.28 → 6493.08] party and how many uh remote operators are waiting to take over these things it's not one-to-one i
[6493.08 → 6500.68] don't think, but they're they're ready for basically them to like not be working uh pretty much and that does
[6500.68 → 6507.08] not show a lot of confidence in the actual autonomous functionality of the product to be clear Waymo has
[6507.08 → 6514.68] the ability to intervene remotely in the operation of their vehicles but i my understanding is that
[6514.68 → 6519.80] it's not such a high ratio of available operators to operating vehicles I don't know if you're trying
[6519.80 → 6525.00] to meme or not bubbly Charizard but the sky train being fully autonomous does not mean that it's the
[6525.00 → 6533.88] equivalent to cyber taxis it's on rails literally there's no traffic literally it's on rails
[6537.08 → 6542.36] why does it stop at 1am yeah I mean I don't know
[6544.68 → 6553.08] well so that people won't sleep on it because reasons I guess um so more specifically if tesla was
[6553.08 → 6559.40] available here if a cyber cab was available here and Vancouver was sufficiently mapped or whatever
[6559.40 → 6564.76] would you get in one no not at this time I'm not against it forever but not at this time
[6565.80 → 6575.40] that was a very small amount of testing to have a significant amount of what seemed like issues that
[6575.40 → 6580.44] should be solved in my opinion the real no they didn't smash in anything which is great
[6580.44 → 6588.92] the really curious thing to me is a big part of tesla's pitch over the years to investors and
[6588.92 → 6596.76] owners of their vehicles has been that they're going to own the race to mapping data by just
[6596.76 → 6602.52] having all the drivers of all the millions of cars that they've sold driving around mapping these
[6602.52 → 6608.12] areas and the way that the goalposts have moved for the launch of this product has been
[6608.12 → 6613.48] uh pretty remarkable for me to behold and i I've just got to wonder like is it just that investors
[6613.48 → 6620.12] are don't have the tech-savvy to fully understand what it is that they're looking at and how different
[6620.12 → 6624.76] what they've deployed is here compared to Waymo and even compared to what they've promised in the past
[6624.76 → 6632.12] like why did they need to do so much manual mapping of this area if their whole leadership in this space
[6632.12 → 6639.24] is that they should have the data already and the claim being made by their CEO is that well because
[6639.24 → 6644.12] we have all this mapping data we're going to be able to roll out new areas like fast there's going to be
[6644.12 → 6649.80] thousands and thousands of these cyber cabs on the road at you know some period xyz um
[6650.60 → 6656.12] but i just I don't understand how we keep believing these claims you know fool me once shame on
[6656.12 → 6663.40] shame on me no fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me but like what about the like 12th
[6663.40 → 6669.32] time I've been fooled like how who's accountable at that point you for sure
[6673.16 → 6680.92] just saying and there's been some comments about it, I would get in one I wouldn't use the service those
[6680.92 → 6686.68] are different things how wait how are those different I'm having a bit of a hard time with
[6686.68 → 6695.08] that um like if I was at an event like if we were at CES oh, and it was like oh there's environment
[6695.88 → 6701.96] yeah it's its not so much the risk i just I don't like I'm looking at a service that based on the
[6701.96 → 6708.20] videos like barely works right so if you need to go pretty much any time I've ever had to get into a cab i
[6708.20 → 6714.84] actually need to be at that place in a relatively okay amount of time um like sure there are examples
[6714.84 → 6718.92] where that hasn't been true, but that's kind of usually how it's going and if it's just going to
[6718.92 → 6727.72] like randomly pull over because a cop is in a parking lot or something like no I'll, I'll go with the Uber
[6727.72 → 6734.68] um I didn't catch the scale last time I was looking at this so it looks like the area they have mapped
[6734.68 → 6740.04] is actually no it's like it's like a few it's like a few miles wide and tall and stuff it's not
[6740.04 → 6746.76] tiny you could conceivably walk it through it like you would you probably wouldn't but this guy this
[6746.76 → 6752.12] man walks like he'll, he'll walk an hour I do them walks to go somewhere especially if I'm in a place
[6752.12 → 6757.72] that I like yeah so I'm actually I'm going to drop a dot right here and then I'm going to get directions to
[6757.72 → 6762.44] like kind of a dot like over here yeah Luca said you wouldn't call one but if your friend calls one you
[6762.44 → 6766.44] would use it yeah like I'm not going to like not get in it on principle or something you could walk
[6766.44 → 6771.56] across the area that they have mapped in on the order of like an hour and something but in
[6771.56 → 6777.96] less than two hours where were we when we uh can you say it looks like it anyway if i
[6777.96 → 6782.84] if I managed to find the right spot again when we did the gamer house the land house uh we were
[6782.84 → 6788.44] allowed to say the city we were in yes where were we are it Austin I think it was Austin yeah that i
[6788.44 → 6792.60] probably like have fair enough oh my back
[6797.56 → 6803.00] OOP all right what do you want to talk about next what do we get what do we get what do we get
[6806.68 → 6812.92] Riot Games nope sure no I'm down with it Riot Games announced that they are opening up
[6812.92 → 6818.36] betting sponsorship opportunities for League of Legends and Valorant esport teams in the America
[6818.84 → 6827.72] and EMEA they stated that according to sport radar there was a 10.7 billion dollar betting turnover
[6827.72 → 6835.16] on just Valorant and League of Legends in 2024 most of which likely being in unregulated markets
[6835.80 → 6842.36] they've partnered with grid to be the required source for official stats in any sports betting
[6842.36 → 6849.96] partnerships they were careful to note that official broadcasts and their social channels will not
[6849.96 → 6856.84] partake in gambling sponsorships and that teams cannot have their logos on their jerseys
[6857.72 → 6862.52] so it will be up to each individual team then to craft how sports betting related content shows up on
[6862.52 → 6870.76] their channel within riot's guidelines content platform TOS and local regulations riot will also vet
[6870.76 → 6880.92] each sponsor sure oh wow okay good thing to have in here no responsibility for the words
[6880.92 → 6887.32] good thing to have in here I take no responsibility for the words that are about to escape between mine
[6887.32 → 6896.44] meat folds I wish he was here Sammy's extremely hot and spicy take what do you more of these on Sancho is that
[6897.00 → 6905.00] this is good his TLDR is that esports isn't particularly profitable at the team level
[6905.00 → 6913.80] so increasing sponsorship dollars for teams plus riot taking steps to regulate this is a positive for me
[6914.44 → 6920.68] the sport is maturing and this is the result but of course be responsible
[6924.12 → 6927.24] I think it's a good thing for the sport I think it is a
[6929.40 → 6932.12] depressingly bad thing for humanity
[6935.00 → 6941.64] that's my take yeah I do think it's a good thing for the sport I'm I'm very I'm very proud
[6942.20 → 6945.24] that we have never taken a gambling sponsorship
[6946.76 → 6951.72] if I had to choose between the survival of the company and the ongoing employment of everyone here
[6953.40 → 6955.32] would my principles bend
[6955.32 → 6965.96] it's interesting I have nothing to gain by having this conversation in public and only your opinion of me to lose
[6965.96 → 6974.92] the truth is I don't know that's tough I actually don't know tough to identify that scenario you know
[6976.04 → 6976.20] well
[6978.28 → 6979.64] yeah because there'd always be like
[6980.84 → 6986.44] there'd always there'd always be another way like another way could be we cut staff fans
[6986.44 → 6999.00] sure I could, I'm not selling nick like right now no you're not um Denali 444 says Luke and Linus
[6999.00 → 7003.24] have you seen the gambling stats for young adults in Canada it's pretty bad it's depressing if it's
[7003.24 → 7009.56] it's because it's been extremely normalized like i i i honestly never thought I'd see this it was
[7009.56 → 7017.24] it's totally taboo it's quaint to see an old episode of like the Simpsons or something where like you know
[7017.24 → 7023.64] oh, oh the the guys are over for yeah the guys are over for gambling night why did it
[7024.28 → 7030.04] like I don't know I don't know if the Simpsons ever did it, but you know like sitcoms did that you know like
[7031.00 → 7035.16] aren't you a cop yeah whatever it's poker night you know like that bit
[7035.16 → 7042.92] it's now I don't I don't think anyone would even bat and eye these days no like if Luke and I gambled
[7042.92 → 7048.76] right now would anybody care it would be normal content it would be normal streaming content which
[7048.76 → 7054.60] is sad the platforms wouldn't care the audience wouldn't care you watch sports which never used
[7054.60 → 7059.96] to talk about it ever it used to actually they would actively try to get stuff shut down and now it
[7059.96 → 7065.08] is the main advertiser for like everything dude i I talked about it already the casters
[7065.08 → 7071.88] talk about it, I talked about it already, but it bears talking about again or bears merits talking
[7071.88 → 7079.72] about again I watched the Stanley Cup finals this year I couldn't believe how brazenly they were
[7079.72 → 7085.72] promoting problematic behaviours problematic gambling behaviours they weren't just saying you know
[7085.72 → 7093.56] you can gamble know your limit play within it like that is in the past now that was now it's like
[7093.56 → 7098.44] before now it's like bet on this one don't forget to bet on that one but have you bet on this other
[7098.44 → 7103.64] one yet oh, oh can you put in enough bets be quick it's going to like the betting for this is going to close
[7103.64 → 7106.68] at a certain don't bet on just one team bet on three teams like
[7106.68 → 7115.32] there's a there's a commercial that I saw recently where somebody like they have a jersey on and they
[7115.32 → 7120.52] place a bet for that team, and then they're like friend comes over, and they're wearing a different
[7120.52 → 7125.80] jersey that's the one I'm talking about that's a horrible commercial it's that is a terrifying
[7125.80 → 7127.48] commercial because it is promoting
[7127.48 → 7136.28] stupid betting habits yeah just betting at any time for any reason for any constantly no research
[7136.28 → 7141.24] no thought process betting based on the most recent random thing you saw that is what they're
[7141.24 → 7149.88] promoting its horrible it's actually so bad god it like ruins people's lives all the time and I don't
[7149.88 → 7159.64] understand it's so weird to me that so few people hold this opinion now it's so odd to me like is this
[7159.64 → 7166.84] me just being a boomer hit these two messages all these young kids, and they're gambling these two messages
[7166.84 → 7175.32] are back to back in float plane chat trash cat says and I'll do the other one first it's the Frenchiest fry
[7175.32 → 7182.84] says my boy scout troop did a fantasy football competition and fantasy football can be fun it can be
[7184.12 → 7191.64] but oftentimes there's money involved and I think it's not a ridiculously wild take to say that
[7191.64 → 7199.88] playing for not money could lead to playing for money could potentially if you are is you are the
[7199.88 → 7208.20] kind of person who is susceptible to be drawn in to that lifestyle right next to them my younger brother
[7208.20 → 7215.72] got hooked on gambling and is like ten thousand dollars in debt those two messages right there dude i
[7215.72 → 7224.44] taught I talked about how much I hated especially after watching mark Robert's video on how rigged
[7224.44 → 7233.24] amusement uh like amusement centres and arcades are I hated how much those games were training my kids
[7233.24 → 7240.12] for gambling whenever we'd go we'd go into them, it's its it's gambling with training wheels it's kitty
[7240.12 → 7249.24] gambling yeah it feels like that whole i I think it's Nescafé do you know this story am I is the wrong
[7249.24 → 7255.00] brand there's a there's a there's a coffee brand that wanted to get into Japan but yeah you know
[7255.00 → 7260.52] this story there's a coffee brand that wanted to get in Japan, and they worked with somebody or did some
[7260.52 → 7264.12] market research or something and found that nobody in Japan likes coffee they just they all like tea
[7264.76 → 7272.20] um so they started introducing like kids candies and stuff that were coffee flavoured, so the kids would
[7272.20 → 7277.16] get used it was nestle Nescafé I don't know its someone uh the kids would get used to the flavour of
[7277.16 → 7282.92] coffee, and then they kept doing stuff like that and now coffee is like an enormous industry in Japan
[7283.48 → 7289.08] they got into Japan not by convincing the adults that it was good they got into Japan by
[7289.96 → 7297.88] and nestle owns Nescafé yeah okay that makes sense great um by doing yeah by like effectively
[7297.88 → 7304.12] advertising to children through getting them used to the flavour coffee stop so these little like
[7304.12 → 7309.56] well it's kind of gambling, but it's not really, and it's for kids is like definitely to get kids
[7309.56 → 7315.32] more into gambling when they're older that's for sure a thing that's one of the who hot takes
[7315.32 → 7322.52] coming back to wan show I'm excited this is the whole thing about why um I don't balk as hard
[7324.76 → 7330.44] at the Nintendo game price increase because if i'm trying to think if I had kids and I had to give
[7330.44 → 7336.04] them a game I would much rather give them older games or games that don't have microtransactions
[7336.04 → 7343.56] in them, I'm going to dump some cold water on that there's literally gambling in Pokémon blue yeah okay
[7344.92 → 7347.32] it helps that also like just lose
[7350.60 → 7354.44] also I would say that the
[7356.84 → 7357.56] oh man
[7357.56 → 7367.64] is Nintendo super gotcha I don't think so they'll milk you they'll sell you amigos they'll sell you
[7367.64 → 7372.20] two copies of the literally going back to the game boy they would sell you Pokémon blue and red and a
[7372.20 → 7380.92] link cable king of the milkers they'll milk you, but they're not super gotcha apparently they have gotcha
[7380.92 → 7386.92] mobile games' oh you can't, you can't count on anybody you can't count on anybody these days
[7386.92 → 7394.92] dang that's sad that sucks but yeah i I mean I think there's value to trying to avoid these
[7394.92 → 7402.36] things, but it is weird to me there is anti-gambling is like not that big of a thing anymore like
[7402.36 → 7406.68] everybody just gave up, and it felt like everybody just gave up at like the same time it was weird
[7406.68 → 7412.44] I feel like twitch just like made it super mainstream you know what oh back to what you were saying about
[7412.44 → 7417.80] Nescafé and the candies and stuff that's actually something that blew my mind about McDonald's
[7417.80 → 7425.32] strategy like McDonald's has been struggling they've been closing stores they're broadly speaking I don't
[7425.32 → 7428.60] know if they like had a good quarter last quarter or whatever the worst rebrand in the world but they
[7428.60 → 7436.36] but they've basically as far as I can tell um lost their mojo back when I was making the
[7436.36 → 7442.52] transition to adulthood remember when they brought in they got rid of the fun kid friend kid
[7442.52 → 7448.68] friendly restaurants with play places, and they made them, and they brought in McCabe with the like the
[7448.68 → 7454.44] green and the brown, and they just tried to they tried to be Starbucks, and it's like and something
[7454.44 → 7460.60] that I've been trying to figure out for basically my entire adult life is what the hell were they
[7460.60 → 7466.76] thinking the only reason that anyone I knew ate McDonald's was because they ate it as a kid
[7467.48 → 7473.24] and my kids don't even like McDonald's but I will say that the occasional McDonald's we went to when
[7473.24 → 7478.92] they were young, and they still had more of the ones that had like the play centres in them and stuff
[7478.92 → 7485.80] they enjoyed going there McDonald's figured it out yeah like decades ago yeah that you just wanted to
[7485.80 → 7491.96] associate the flavour of McDonald's with happy family memories, and you'd be hooked for life and
[7491.96 → 7498.92] then they were just like you know what cartoon characters that appeal to kids no forget it adults
[7498.92 → 7508.52] have more money we should appeal to a dog guess who buys stuff for kids are you crazy anyway good luck
[7508.52 → 7511.80] McDonald's truthfully I don't care about your success your food sucks
[7511.80 → 7522.20] and yes that is just conditioning so much of marketing Maori in float plane chat is just
[7522.20 → 7531.80] conditioning is it maori I don't know um Shubham says McDonald's is not a service company it's a
[7531.80 → 7537.40] real estate company yeah but I mean what's the machine that creates the money to invest in real
[7537.40 → 7542.28] estate like you have to you have to have an operating business all right
[7546.68 → 7553.64] should we talk about brand's kill switch to case controversy what does this say hold on oh what are you
[7553.64 → 7565.48] doing what am I looking at that's awesome this is sick is that current it seems like it
[7565.48 → 7570.60] it sees like that's sweet well that's not inspiring but
[7574.12 → 7580.52] well yeah why is fast food so much better in Japan that's cool that's wild all right make
[7580.52 → 7587.88] McDonald's cool again brand's kill switch 2 case has been under fire for having issues with joy cons
[7587.88 → 7595.08] detaching when pressure is applied brand responded on Reddit with a lengthy post with a lot of focus on
[7595.08 → 7600.28] how the device is generally meant to be held uh-oh
[7603.56 → 7607.96] they outlined that the issue stemmed from some manufacturing tolerances in the case for the joy
[7607.96 → 7616.36] con controllers um and committed to dealing with any affected users but the takeaway from Redditors who saw
[7616.36 → 7624.36] the post was you guys did not just you're holding it wrong us did you a couple of days later brand
[7624.36 → 7630.28] issued a part two to their response they condensed their longer response down to just four points
[7630.28 → 7635.72] and acknowledged the shortcomings of their previous response brand provided us something to read
[7635.72 → 7643.72] we up them not use this time it's not it's not my controversy hashtag not my controversy
[7643.72 → 7651.08] it wasn't use not only did we up by not seeing this prior to shipping but we up by responding with
[7651.08 → 7656.04] 4 000 words that could have effectively been boiled down to you're holding it wrong ultimately debating
[7656.04 → 7660.28] the right or wrong way to hold a console is besides the point customers should be able to hold this thing
[7660.28 → 7665.56] however they want without the joy cons detaching after reading the feedback it is clear that neither
[7665.56 → 7670.84] our response nor the conditional if you're affected solution was welcomed by the community
[7671.48 → 7676.28] since then our engineering team has dug deep to find alternative solutions come up with two and we
[7676.28 → 7681.32] have communicated this new plan everyone is getting a free replacement regardless of whether they're
[7681.32 → 7685.56] severely affected haven't experienced the issue have emailed us a dozen times or have no clue about any of
[7685.56 → 7690.84] this on July 10th we'll know which of the two proposed new joycon solutions is going to be viable
[7691.40 → 7697.24] one is mass reducible and a real improvement over the current good but inconsistent version the
[7697.24 → 7701.32] other is borderline impossible to mass produce, but we're going to try anyway because it will result
[7701.32 → 7706.68] in a joycon attachment that's truly flawless you can't say that and not do it that's so dangerous in
[7706.68 → 7711.48] the end we remain committed to cantor responsiveness and when we something up making sure we own it and
[7711.48 → 7723.08] getting customers the right product you on the other hand remain short I liked brand good stuff
[7724.92 → 7730.76] they're good to stuff you know what else is good stuff I still remember before we had this level
[7730.76 → 7736.44] of relationship with them, I remember one time at CES uh I had filmed so many videos and I was mentally
[7736.44 → 7740.84] cooked and I got to another brand sponsorship and I think it was my like fifth of the day or something
[7741.48 → 7746.60] uh so instead of saying the ad read I just said their name like 50 times
[7748.84 → 7755.80] and the next day I was like oh man I like probably shouldn't have done that, and then they saw it and
[7755.80 → 7768.44] were like this is amazing and I was like whoa all right they're cool oh man Lord Microsoft doesn't
[7768.44 → 7774.84] want another crowd strike incident and is kicking antivirus out of the kernel windows is making big
[7774.84 → 7779.72] changes to cybersecurity removing third-party security drivers from the kernel and running them
[7779.72 → 7785.08] instead in user space kernel space is the layer of the OS with the most privileges allowing direct
[7785.08 → 7790.12] access to many hardware functions and resources and antivirus software typically likes to have kernel
[7790.12 → 7794.20] access because it provides the ability to handle almost any malicious threat that may have wiggled its
[7794.20 → 7800.44] way into your system the issue though is that kernel access can bring substantial stability issues
[7800.44 → 7806.44] a faulty update that was pushed was what caused the crowd strike meltdown that like actually impacted
[7806.44 → 7813.00] like world infrastructure was not good this is why security experts recommend that Microsoft remove
[7813.00 → 7818.84] third-party driver access to the kernel so in July Microsoft will be launching a private preview of new
[7818.84 → 7824.12] features as part of their windows' resiliency initiative this announcement comes with quotes from a variety of
[7824.12 → 7829.64] security partners singing the praises of the move notably though none of these companies have
[7829.64 → 7834.20] actually committed to moving their drivers out of the kernel at this time it's worth noting that
[7834.20 → 7840.28] Microsoft tried to do this back with Windows vista, but antivirus companies filed an antitrust complaint with
[7840.28 → 7848.04] the EU and Microsoft backed down because it would have made it so only Microsoft can handle kernel level
[7848.04 → 7856.68] security our discussion question then is what methods could Microsoft be taking or what steps could
[7856.68 → 7862.20] Microsoft be taking to provide security software with the same abilities that they have without providing
[7862.20 → 7865.72] them kernel access and I got to confess I don't know enough about the inner workings of an operating
[7865.72 → 7872.44] system to even begin to speculate our other question is I don't know what does this mean for kernel-based
[7872.44 → 7879.48] anti-cheat software and therefore potentially the year of the Linux desktop because that's a lot of
[7879.48 → 7885.00] the justification that I've heard for why they won't port their anti-cheat to Linux is that they can't
[7885.00 → 7888.84] run at a kernel level and windows allows it so if neither of them allow it
[7891.00 → 7893.48] and if that's true what happens to cheating in video games
[7895.72 → 7899.24] so okay it sounds like you're ready to kind of both sides this a little bit
[7899.24 → 7905.48] you clearly as someone whose security minded do not want anything mucking around with the
[7905.48 → 7914.92] kernel of your operating system yes however as a gamer who likes to not be um you know 360 now scoped
[7914.92 → 7920.68] through the map from the other side of a Markov raid or whatever uh instance what are they even
[7920.68 → 7929.32] called no yes that was right raid nice good um terminology appreciate what can be achieved through
[7929.32 → 7937.08] kernel level monitoring of what's going on a system or in many cases not achieved but is there
[7937.08 → 7941.08] a better than nothing argument to be made here I think we can't just give up on everything just for
[7941.08 → 7948.28] the sake of gaming um I also think that if we really do want to get away from you can never completely
[7948.28 → 7954.12] get away from it but if we want to try to get away from the incredibly rampant level that cheating in
[7954.12 → 7960.28] video games is currently at like literally by far worse than ever um and there's a lot of evidence
[7960.28 → 7970.12] for this uh I think we're going to have to funny enough with the consoles like kind of exiting the world right
[7970.12 → 7977.16] now I feel like we almost need to go back to console like devices I've said this on when show before it
[7977.16 → 7981.40] was a hot take back then I still have it now I think you're going to have to have something that's
[7981.40 → 7990.04] really locked down, and it has these types of like kernel level totally taken over uh but i I would want
[7990.04 → 7997.08] it separates from my pc because I wouldn't want that level of um secured uh other people's security stuff
[7997.96 → 8006.60] on my pc, or maybe it's a setup that you can do on your own computer I'll tell you what's a setup
[8006.60 → 8013.24] you setting me up for our next topic okay announcements went up last week from Xbox
[8013.24 → 8019.80] president Sarah bond and AMD chair and CEO dr Lisa sue about AMD and Xbox's renewed partnership to
[8019.80 → 8026.04] co-engineer silicon for new Xbox hardware this isn't that big of a surprise AMD worked with Microsoft
[8026.04 → 8031.88] all the way back on the Xbox 360 as ATI at the time for the GPU and then provided a custom APU for
[8031.88 → 8039.24] the Xbox One and series lineups it does however solidify the direction that the Xbox is taking for
[8039.24 → 8047.56] their hardware bond speaks about Xbox being a lineup across console handheld pc cloud and accessories
[8047.56 → 8051.64] with both leaders emphasizing that backwards compatibility is a priority so you can continue
[8051.64 → 8057.96] to play your old games on new hardware so does that change anything about what you said where it
[8057.96 → 8065.72] seems like AMD and Microsoft are coming out and saying hey Xbox consoles are not going anywhere
[8066.60 → 8073.72] and does that potentially validate sort of your take that there's going to be the pc gaming experience
[8073.72 → 8077.56] which is going to just come with all the problems of not being able to have kernel level security
[8077.56 → 8085.48] hardware level security and would you consider an Xbox console if it offered a more pc-like experience
[8085.48 → 8092.76] experience except that it was just games and locked the crap down yeah the one of the problems there is's
[8092.76 → 8096.20] absolutely cheaters on console and like has been
[8098.28 → 8106.68] forever I do think the barrier at least right now I would say is higher because than pc cheating on pc is
[8106.68 → 8116.52] literally like advertised in banner ads on YouTube like cheating on pc doesn't require anything anymore
[8116.52 → 8121.88] when I was a kid it was like you had to at least be like kind of script kitty level yeah, but you could
[8121.88 → 8127.32] do it, and it really wasn't that hard yeah um it was mostly like you had to be script kitty level for the
[8127.32 → 8134.20] awareness more than anything not the actual ability um to not like nuke your computer in the process and to
[8134.20 → 8139.88] even like know what to look for and stuff like that um now it's like advertised to you, and it's like
[8139.88 → 8146.44] white glove service, and you pay like subscription models for the good ones and like if you pay enough
[8146.44 → 8152.28] there's people that will custom-make one specifically for you to help you from getting banned like it is
[8152.28 → 8161.08] it is a multi many many many billions of dollars industry billions are you sure yep billions it's bad with
[8161.08 → 8168.52] a b I'm pretty darn sure it's huge there's people that play subscriptions for cheats for games that are many hundreds of
[8168.52 → 8171.16] dollars and those are not the custom tailored ones
[8173.48 → 8176.28] there's like it's an it's a huge deal
[8178.20 → 8187.40] there are a lot of really lame losers it's crazy Luke wisdom tips it's crazy how many trash people there are it's
[8187.40 → 8193.16] it's actually wild um wow parallelogram in float plane chat says people be paying
[8193.16 → 8198.60] twenty dollars a day for cheats that I know of there 's's weekend passes
[8200.44 → 8202.60] like it's its wild
[8204.52 → 8210.04] is this a big part of what's driving how difficult it is to jump into a lobby and play online now
[8210.04 → 8213.72] in my opinion are there just so many cheaters there is an incredible amount
[8213.72 → 8218.68] like that Markov thing where they were like there's kind of at least one in every lobby
[8219.80 → 8223.56] after that I started trying to look around I was like is this really a Markov issue no
[8225.24 → 8232.92] it's everywhere I do think Markov could do way more okay that it is not quite the same thing yeah but
[8232.92 → 8240.12] that's still a lot um i I believe Markov could do a lot more they could add replays would be huge and
[8240.12 → 8245.00] they're not doing it and i I honestly think it's because people would see how bad the situation is
[8245.00 → 8249.80] um they have replays in arena they absolutely have the technology they could do it, and they're just
[8249.80 → 8257.88] not doing it um Markov is worse than when that video came out that's really debatable and extremely
[8257.88 → 8262.68] difficult to measure but my point is that it's everywhere this is not just a Markov issue the problem
[8262.68 → 8267.72] is that the impact of it is extremely high in Markov, but it is literally ever there are cheaters in rocket
[8267.72 → 8277.08] league how do you wouldn't, it be so obvious i guess not like if you just what like driving
[8277.08 → 8282.60] assists or like there are things like you can get the ball up on your hood, and then you can kind of like
[8282.60 → 8288.20] dribble it by keeping it on your car and there's there are cheats that can yeah somebody just said
[8288.20 → 8294.28] dribble scripts yeah exactly there are cheats that can do that like car shake for you so you would just
[8294.28 → 8302.36] drive normally, and it would keep the ball on your hood for you um i I believe there's other stuff
[8302.36 → 8306.20] as well but that's the only one I know of because uh sunless con had a video on it recently
[8308.28 → 8314.52] it's its uh it's everywhere there are cheaters in war zone casual yeah they're not even necessarily
[8314.52 → 8320.36] playing competitive modes like it's its everywhere if you're playing multiplayer games these days that
[8320.36 → 8327.48] are competitive you're playing with cheaters oh but I have good news this Monday I attended
[8328.44 → 8331.08] a meeting oh at surrey city hall
[8333.72 → 8339.24] I don't know where this is going it was the second reading of our temporary use permit for whale land
[8339.24 → 8349.16] and we're good to go oh really i I got kind of the idea based on your body language, but it's nice to
[8349.16 → 8355.88] hear it officially we're in we're in that's fantastic surrey is down to clown and I don't know if I'm
[8355.88 → 8361.72] supposed to announce it yet but the first whale land I have a date, and it will be before the end of
[8361.72 → 8367.16] this year, so chase is chase oh wait i I announced this I actually talked about this on the live
[8367.16 → 8371.48] stream yesterday that we did but a lot of you probably didn't watch that um chase is literally
[8371.48 → 8378.44] working on it now right now well okay not now but a few hours ago he was when before he left the
[8378.44 → 8386.68] office too bad he can't get away from cheating at lance what we can, I think we I think that I think that
[8386.68 → 8395.32] when the consequences are literally being escorted out of the building um I don't I don't really think
[8395.32 → 8400.36] that's happened at one of our lands to be honest to give us time it's very possible I would do it no, no
[8400.36 → 8408.52] no you know I'd do it I don't mean that oh you mean cheating yeah if we catch you will never
[8409.16 → 8413.08] set foot at a whale land again could we have it in the thing that it's like name and shame
[8413.08 → 8419.16] I would just do it I don't care who cares I mean we'll have like we'll have what we'll have filming
[8419.16 → 8424.12] notices as part of like whale land like you will consent to your likeness etc when show banner of
[8424.12 → 8430.84] shame yeah I can't just rotation for all time no, no because people want notoriety no they wouldn't
[8430.84 → 8436.76] get that absolutely not Linus is more experienced at this yeah no, no no, no no, no no, no, but they would
[8436.76 → 8445.00] absolutely be shamed in person oh yeah, and it'd be awful oh because like I don't like you yeah like
[8445.00 → 8451.40] it's that simple man yeah not cool yeah not cool yeah this is a friendly event we're all we're all
[8451.40 → 8457.72] friends here you don't do that there's just there are so many examples of streamers getting caught cheating
[8459.24 → 8464.76] there are so many examples of people getting caught cheating at major tournaments by having cheats like
[8464.76 → 8469.24] built into the tiny amount of memory on their mouse or whatever else like just all these different
[8469.24 → 8478.20] ways it's uh it's its rough out there so if there was a thing that offered at least a solid amount of
[8478.20 → 8485.64] reprieve like I'm not I'm not expecting literally anything to solve it at all but if there's something
[8485.64 → 8492.68] that added a good amount of reprieve i would go for it um last thing here is that um
[8492.68 → 8498.84] um Xbox president Sarah bond also spoke about working closely with the windows team to
[8498.84 → 8504.92] ensure that windows is the number one platform for gaming and not locked to a single store I think
[8504.92 → 8511.72] we've talked a little bit about this when we spoke about the um the Xbox and rogue allay collaboration
[8511.72 → 8519.00] product, but it's very clear the direction that Microsoft wants to go with you know Xbox is any screen in
[8519.00 → 8525.64] your home uh be it windows or running Xbox operating system or running Tyson OS or whatever the case may be
[8526.92 → 8535.56] that's their vision uh this is cool an Asus RTX 5090 back to front card connector seems to be able to do up
[8535.56 → 8545.56] to 1900 watts without burning up tony you asus china's gm showcased exactly what you can do with a
[8545.56 → 8555.16] different peculiar power connector like the GC HPR connector on the rogue astral 5090 BTF so you can
[8555.16 → 8561.88] actually if you want to show your mouse on the uh the power connector there um this new BTF card design
[8561.88 → 8569.88] has a detachable GC HPR allowing you to choose between it and a standard 12 volt high power connectors
[8569.88 → 8575.08] or 12 volts 2x6 I think is what we meant to put in the script that's really cool it allows you to use the
[8575.08 → 8581.96] card with a BTF motherboard if you have one but also retain your resale value for the person who likely
[8581.96 → 8585.08] won't have a BTF motherboard who you want to like to sell it to when you're ready to upgrade
[8585.80 → 8591.40] the chair connector was designed to handle a thousand watts, but you used a chroma load tester
[8591.40 → 8597.40] with the connector at a constant 670 watts plenty to uh to power a standard RTX 5090 with it staying
[8597.40 → 8604.84] between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius he pushed it to 1300 watts which saw it increase to 38 degrees Celsius
[8604.84 → 8611.16] still very comfortable and as an extreme the chroma was turned up to 1900 watts with the connector staying
[8611.16 → 8621.72] around 41 degrees Celsius which is not bad at all here we go here come the amps bring on the amps
[8621.72 → 8625.96] oh I forgot his name but I've met him
[8629.08 → 8631.32] 1900 watts
[8632.92 → 8639.16] gorgeous great work BTF just needs to be a thing uh discussion question is cool but I wouldn't want
[8639.16 → 8645.48] that much power running through my motherboard which is fair enough I mean it's DC so like the level like
[8645.48 → 8651.40] i I don't design PCBs for a living, but my understanding is that that would be less likely
[8651.40 → 8659.08] to cause interference than um ac obviously but does just run that kind of power through your
[8659.08 → 8666.36] motherboard if you have enough um if you have enough isolation between your power plane and your data
[8666.36 → 8671.08] planes or man it would depend kind of where it's coming from where it's going to would that be the
[8671.08 → 8677.00] end of the world maybe not I don't know anything about it cat o acid usually fine I wonder if they
[8677.00 → 8681.80] just had a hole, and you could just what we really need the cable through what we really need to do is
[8681.80 → 8686.60] just like I can't believe that we've gone through so many iterations of updating the standard to like
[8686.60 → 8691.40] needing new connectors and basically needing to replace this stuff, and we haven't increased the voltage
[8691.40 → 8697.16] Tynan said it's fine, but it might get toasty yeah which is not fine well it can be fine
[8697.16 → 8701.40] I like toast
[8703.56 → 8709.80] finally Xbox app merging all game launchers question mark recently users in the insiders
[8709.80 → 8714.76] update program for windows saw an update to the Xbox app this update included combining other
[8714.76 → 8719.72] storefronts battle net game pass steam into the same launcher in an attempt to improve the user experience
[8719.72 → 8725.48] ah yes the proliferation of standards users will also be able to see the different launcher options
[8725.48 → 8729.80] in the Xbox app so they know if they are launching a game from steam or another platform
[8729.80 → 8734.28] steam is the first and only storefront they have right now but Microsoft confirms this is just the
[8734.28 → 8739.40] beginning hoping to add many launchers to the app though no promise that you won't need to install
[8739.40 → 8744.36] those dedicated launchers still for the game to open yeah you definitely will discussion question
[8744.36 → 8747.96] do you prefer one store that tries to combine launchers or several launchers that are consistent
[8747.96 → 8753.08] with themselves and are clearer about where you are um I just want everything to run on steam
[8753.08 → 8760.84] if you uh oh if it didn't require the launchers you could have already done it through steam and
[8760.84 → 8765.48] you've been able to do it that way through steam I don't want to say forever because that's not true
[8765.48 → 8772.20] but for a very long time yeah um and like i I like when I buy a game on steam, and it's like an origin game
[8772.20 → 8776.76] but I open the game, and it just like shows a quick origin thing, and then it like goes away and then steam is
[8776.76 → 8781.72] just there and the game is there and then I close it, and it's like origin something I don't know bye
[8781.72 → 8787.72] forget it and I go back to big picture is it even still called origin I don't know who cares me i
[8787.72 → 8797.56] don't need to know yeah cool Linus aren't we against monopolies asks m9 and g27 I love steam but
[8797.56 → 8804.84] we are against monopolies, but valve is not a monopoly yeah not at all actually valve has real competition
[8804.84 → 8813.00] they're just clearly the best one yes good luck Tim Sweeney to the Sweeney copter
[8815.16 → 8816.12] epic games
[8816.12 → 8828.04] oh my goodness okay yeah yeah house fresh is done this one is hey now be nice to Tim Sweeney says
[8828.84 → 8834.36] I think he'll be all right I don't think Tim Sweeney cares what I think no are we done all who got mad

[8866.60 → 8871.16] all right hit me up Dan is it time for after dark I think by the way if you didn't migrate from
[8871.16 → 8878.76] origin to Ea app you lose stuff it's probably fine lose what yeah lose my copy of battlefield 2
[8879.48 → 8884.76] I'm talking about the story on wan show about how I used to share my origin account yes with the Russian
[8884.76 → 8886.92] hacker guy well that's sweet of you
[8890.20 → 8894.92] I'm going to download the Ea app right now and I'm going to log into it to see if i even still have an
[8894.92 → 8902.04] account there you get threat cockered so I used to yeah some definitely Russian dude
[8903.16 → 8908.60] he used to he would steal my origin account and play games um but I like didn't really care because
[8908.60 → 8913.80] i very rarely used it oh I can't install it because I'm getting in there right now I'm getting in there
[8913.80 → 8919.88] right now I can't install the thing just give me two seconds please request admin I was already
[8919.88 → 8925.00] logging in did you press the button request admin you mean login as administrator no I don't
[8925.00 → 8933.00] I don't even know what it is sent request as fast as I can, it's a good thing it's a good thing
[8933.00 → 8937.40] the threat locker is installed on my work machine that is a good thing it's not installed on all
[8937.40 → 8944.44] your work machines any more you shouldn't tell the people that now I'm an attack well no it is
[8944.44 → 8948.12] technically it is now looked what you've done installed and I'm not I'm not actually pulling
[8948.12 → 8956.44] that back it is installed okay so much for being c-suite Linus I mean c-suites can be hacked if
[8956.44 → 8963.00] anything they're the best targets get to do some of that whaling yeah uh but yeah i he would take my
[8963.00 → 8968.04] account and I wouldn't care and then many months later I would suddenly care except to play something
[8968.04 → 8973.56] and i I still he had the password I had the secret question so instead of resetting the password I would
[8973.56 → 8977.56] just log you were able to log in with the secret question somehow or something I don't remember exactly
[8977.56 → 8983.80] what um so I would get in and play my game for a while, and he would leave me alone for
[8983.80 → 8989.32] like a while and then uh I guess he just checked like a month later or something, and then he would
[8989.32 → 8995.64] take it back and keep playing and i just I thought it was funny so i just never fixed the problem um i
[8995.64 → 8999.48] don't remember all the details, but it's something like that and uh I remember you telling me about this
[8999.48 → 9005.56] this is back in like the Langley house days yeah this is a long time ago uh and he added games to the
[9005.56 → 9013.00] account, so there's like football manager and like all this other random stuff I was like what are you
[9013.00 → 9020.36] doing like why would you do that on my account but then I just still never cared um I think
[9020.36 → 9025.48] eventually I was trying to play something, and he kept booting me out over and over again so I was like
[9025.48 → 9034.04] all right we're done now and i officially finally fixed it but did it start installing oh you can now run
[9034.04 → 9039.88] this application run now all right let's see it was fun for a while see if we can do this maybe he
[9039.88 → 9047.64] has your Reddit credentials it's just being kind online that's a that's a sick that's a good reference
[9050.60 → 9055.48] anyway we can move on to our next thing for now we don't have one yeah just merge messages it's
[9055.48 → 9060.92] after dark let's go yeah that's what I meant that's what I meant should we do super dark mode
[9061.48 → 9069.48] because of the glow sure oh I won't see anything we see it for a second we can see it for a second
[9069.48 → 9075.00] okay, okay give me one sec this physical button I can do it no, no dan's got the control but is
[9075.00 → 9081.24] the no he's actually he's producer Dan yeah how dare you disrespect him like that he's not glowing oh these
[9081.24 → 9089.48] jesus you're needy yeah doing it for the audience oh what's that light down that one
[9093.32 → 9098.20] it's not going to have any glow left by the time we actually get it yeah oh windows cannot access
[9098.20 → 9105.16] the specified device path or file where is he going I can't install Ea app
[9105.16 → 9114.20] oh he's cooking let him cook oh launch the app what it says it's already installed now
[9115.08 → 9120.92] I don't think I can launch it seems like a problem you seem like a problem sometimes got him
[9126.12 → 9132.12] oh hold on oh yeah no, no she's working look she's working she's cooking there we go
[9135.16 → 9144.84] okay keep me signed in okay you just you know that my what my username yeah yeah why would I not know
[9144.84 → 9153.16] my username it's just my email oh okay fair enough I don't know my username for origin but I guess
[9153.16 → 9159.08] it's just my email it's probably fine I think it's this one yeah it's too late yeah it's too late we
[9159.08 → 9164.28] can't see our glowing table anymore because it's not charged anymore also I don't think it's dark enough
[9164.28 → 9171.00] maybe the purple light is the problem yeah the purple is the problem oh, but they can't see yeah
[9171.00 → 9175.08] no yeah I can see it glowing, but they definitely can't see that we could turn the lights back on
[9175.08 → 9180.84] I think they can kind of see it this has gotten awkward at this point they can see me I mean yeah
[9180.84 → 9186.76] here why am I visible and not you uh maybe you're whiter than me oh you have a white screen on your
[9186.76 → 9194.20] computer oh so if we goodbye yeah there you go yeah, yeah okay, okay there you go okay they can see it

[9221.80 → 9227.96] like the whole point of the show is it thought for them to enjoy is it though yeah okay when show after
[9227.96 → 9234.68] dark here we go here are the games that time to flash bang them here are the games that I own on Ea app
[9234.68 → 9245.88] oh ouch I have free to play games Apex Legends and the Sims 4 nice I think oh no add to your library
[9245.88 → 9254.52] so I don't have these I guess okay my library includes such hits as battlefield 3 nice battlefields
[9254.52 → 9264.44] bad company 2 nice so you stopped playing battlefields at the correct time I never played
[9264.44 → 9269.96] battlefield this is for benchmarking oh that makes sense benchmarking battlefield at the right time
[9269.96 → 9277.40] yeah crusader no remorse a game that I have been meaning to play since I was like nine uh crisis 3
[9278.44 → 9283.88] dragon age inquisition it takes two which I actually own through steam whatever this is
[9283.88 → 9290.36] NOX dude NOX is uh NOX is sick ancient school RPG plants versus zombies garden wars 2 which i only
[9290.36 → 9295.96] own because of a make-a-wish um thing where they wanted to play this and I was like okay I'll bite
[9295.96 → 9301.32] I'll buy this game surprisingly good yeah it's actually pretty fun uh battlefront titan fall 2 which is
[9301.32 → 9305.80] because of you but also just through steam and unravel 2 which i actually just played uh with my wife
[9306.36 → 9313.64] and we enjoyed if it was fine yeah yeah the story was I didn't really understand but um apparently not
[9313.64 → 9321.24] not supposed to yeah so that's cool okay hit me Dan sure I've got a few here hello wins took and
[9321.24 → 9327.88] when Linus have you seen the live action version yet and what are your thoughts live what the live
[9327.88 → 9335.16] action version not yet I'm so I'm like actually I'm actively stressed about seeing it the live show
[9335.16 → 9343.16] how to train your dragon one is the perfect movie it is better than any other movie except maybe the
[9343.16 → 9350.36] incredible and I don't know there are plenty of movies I love but how to train your dragon one is a
[9350.36 → 9359.64] perfect movie um chat says it seems pretty good uh Elijah said it was pretty mid I don't know man I don't know
[9359.64 → 9370.04] um you loved it okay that's something um but why do live action see that's the question it was
[9370.04 → 9375.88] already perfect I would have rather they just did like a remaster with new textures and HDR lighting
[9376.52 → 9382.28] you know I agree I don't like live action remakes they're not even live action
[9382.28 → 9390.84] like that's the thing the main character is still CGI I was seriously wronged with the release of
[9390.84 → 9398.60] the warcraft movie that was a crime against me in particular and then all of Hollywood decided that
[9398.60 → 9405.64] they were going to release worse versions of childhood classics by taking one of the most charming
[9405.64 → 9411.72] aspects about them and making them quote unquote live action okay living in chat is that Reese
[9413.24 → 9421.64] oh is living Reese no uh Reese's uh dirt wizard hold on living is uh is um pancreas that's right
[9421.64 → 9426.76] okay if i thought it was Reese and I was going to be like okay because Reese and I are pretty
[9426.76 → 9432.68] aligned on movie taste so far from what I've seen so far uh he agrees the breakfast club is actual
[9433.40 → 9441.96] unmitigated disaster um based but living um pancreas you I don't know how aligned we are on movie taste
[9441.96 → 9449.08] yet I'm not saying your taste is bad I'm just saying that maybe I do I just don't know yet I don't know
[9449.08 → 9454.36] yet make sure that you're agreeing with the narcissist, or you might lose your job oh stop
[9455.48 → 9463.80] speaking of which speaking of which movie night last Friday yeah what'd you guys think last action hero it
[9463.80 → 9469.88] was very good I was way more surprised than I was expecting to be I actually wasn't surprised and
[9469.88 → 9475.32] I enjoyed it a lot yeah I know that was uh that was sick uh pinky draws says the dungeon dragons movie
[9475.32 → 9480.04] was awesome though and I agree it was very good actually really deserves a lot more than it got and
[9480.04 → 9484.52] I'm very sad that people didn't realize how good that movie was because it might not get another one
[9484.52 → 9490.68] and that would be very it wasn't super, super polished, but it was exactly what it was supposed
[9490.68 → 9497.56] to be yes it was so self-aware yeah it was great, and it was self-aware very appropriately because it
[9497.56 → 9501.72] was still a good story still a good character yes despite being self-aware and that's what I love
[9501.72 → 9507.32] about last action hero what was the other movie exactly what it's doing the other one you were
[9507.32 → 9513.48] talking about the soldiers dragons oh yeah yeah no that was very good, so last action hero is
[9513.48 → 9522.84] both an action movie and also a spoof of everything that made especially 80s action movies kind of
[9522.84 → 9529.96] cringeworthy and unbearable so it does everything that they do to the nth degree while
[9529.96 → 9539.08] also straight-faced being an action movie I love it and I hadn't even remembered the like celebrity
[9539.08 → 9546.92] cameos at the end it had everybody it had bill freaking Murray in it dude this the scene when
[9546.92 → 9552.60] maria shiver like gives Arnold Schwarzenegger like Arnold Schwarzenegger the actor playing himself
[9552.60 → 9558.28] instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the like the action hero guy she like gives him crap about
[9558.28 → 9564.20] talking about promoting his stupid restaurants on the red carpet like oh it's so many it's so good it was
[9564.20 → 9574.60] perfect it was fantastic I enjoyed it a lot um anywho more yeah so I will see how to train your
[9574.60 → 9580.44] dragon but I'll probably I don't think I'm gonna bother in the theatre I think I'll wait and I'll
[9580.44 → 9586.44] watch it in my theatre at home watch on your phone just to give it an extra little no that's like a
[9586.44 → 9591.96] guarantee you're making you're making it lose yeah I did that I did that with gladiator 2 I watched it
[9591.96 → 9596.04] on a plane on purpose and I was like just to disrespect it I'm not going to like this and then i
[9596.04 → 9601.40] like hate watched the whole thing and got to the end was just mad yeah I watched that at home and was
[9601.96 → 9609.72] incredibly upset I loved gladiator 1 so much, and it was an incredible disaster Jimmy soon town says
[9609.72 → 9619.40] load it on an iPod video and watch it there yeah yeah kindle yikes okay hey LLD would you consider
[9619.40 → 9624.04] doing other transparent products such as a transparent backpack for security checks and
[9624.04 → 9631.00] how long does it take to prototype the transparent driver uh three years so we're interested in other
[9631.00 → 9636.28] transparent products but I can pretty much promise you that we're not making prices raincoat from
[9636.84 → 9644.76] Blade Runner um as in backpack form um i just i I can't think of a material that would be
[9644.76 → 9654.60] clear enough to really see through but also um robust enough for us to be confident making a backpack with
[9654.60 → 9654.76] it
[9656.76 → 9663.96] so triton well it's its rigid though yeah would you really want a rigid backpack plenty of them
[9663.96 → 9668.44] that you put cats in them, they're like they're like they're all domes they are a thing
[9672.68 → 9678.52] isn't that like isn't that fjallraven backpack fairly rigid and that was like incredibly popular
[9678.52 → 9684.76] for many years oh hi josh says you literally ride a motorcycle okay all right all right all
[9684.76 → 9689.08] right all right okay it's not because you can strap luggage to your back if you really want to but
[9689.08 → 9697.48] i we have so much work to do you know continuing to innovate in like soft goods backpacks that i
[9697.48 → 9703.64] don't know that I'm ready to just completely change gears and go into an entirely new product category
[9703.64 → 9712.60] so no promises for now oh fray says do you know why last action hero was a flop
[9712.60 → 9721.24] it opened the same week as Jurassic Park oh my god that makes so much more sense because we were
[9721.24 → 9726.84] talking about this after it did make money yeah but barely and when you look like nobody
[9726.84 → 9732.68] remembers it yeah it was an 80 million dollar budget for a movie that did like what was it like 150 mid
[9732.68 → 9740.44] total and Jurassic Park was like groundbreaking yeah from special effects and artistry and just
[9740.44 → 9747.08] so good apparently the marketing was also just a total disaster as well pancratic said it's just
[9747.08 → 9753.56] like titan fall 2 in that oh man oh no don't think everyone saw me go through that no that's funny oh no
[9755.64 → 9761.56] oh no hey I played it I bought it I played it titan fall 2 was great the single player is actually
[9761.56 → 9768.44] outstanding oh best single player shooter I've played since I was a wee child my biggest complaint is
[9768.44 → 9774.76] that you don't get to enjoy the super amazing cool fun gimmicks for long enough, but that's one of the
[9774.76 → 9781.08] reasons why it's so good leave them wanting more yeah if all of its perfect yeah it'll always be perfect
[9782.68 → 9788.36] how is your home assistant integrations going would love to know what works well and what doesn't
[9788.36 → 9796.20] what's that one automation that you can't live without not going to lie Jake and I were brainstorming um
[9797.16 → 9806.52] a way to make fixing my house into content today, and we came up with a list of all the stuff about
[9806.52 → 9811.16] my smart house that's just kind of stupid and doesn't work or was poorly designed or implemented
[9811.16 → 9815.88] in the first place or we just never really finished because we got the video done got it to like minimum
[9815.88 → 9821.00] viable product works as a demo point and then just left it there um so I think it's actually going to be
[9821.00 → 9828.36] a series video one will be us going through and going oh yeah that what's what's rough yeah current
[9828.36 → 9833.64] state, and then we're gonna we're going to go like full automotive channel style, and we're just going to have
[9833.64 → 9838.04] a piece of cardboard that we're going to write all the problems on and then over the series of a bunch of
[9838.04 → 9842.76] videos going forward we're going to cross them out cool I like that yeah that sounds cool that's a
[9842.76 → 9850.76] great idea we stopped doing series and like multipart content oh this is interesting do more
[9850.76 → 9858.92] p-ball-y p-ball says fun fact the animated Anastasia movie did worse because Disney re-released
[9858.92 → 9863.64] the little mermaid in theatres at the same time I wouldn't put it I wouldn't put it above Disney to
[9863.64 → 9868.28] pull a move like that I don't know if that's true that's allegedly but i i I wouldn't put that past
[9868.28 → 9877.48] Disney my lady ruined her own proposal should I redo it if so should I choose a new location
[9879.72 → 9885.64] if it's ruined you should redo it as someone whose proposal was ruined not by the lady but by myself
[9886.44 → 9892.44] I can tell you from experience that you will never hear the end of it you might not hear about it often
[9893.08 → 9897.80] and it might be in good humour you know mostly
[9900.60 → 9906.92] but she will remember it for better for worse in sickness and in health till death do you part
[9907.96 → 9917.48] so yeah I'd probably redo it if I were you if I were you cheers guys loved the video on mix mark ii for
[9917.48 → 9925.08] your home systems how often do you find both change cases as part of an upgrade new builds versus
[9925.08 → 9930.76] reusing or favourite sentimental cases sorry this is a little self it's this is a little hard to parse
[9931.64 → 9937.00] how often do you change your case there you upgrade versus reusing a favourite or sentimental case
[9938.36 → 9945.80] my situation is not really fair for this um I have kept the case
[9947.48 → 9954.60] yeah I've advised a lot of other people to keep their cases and in builds that I've kind of like
[9954.60 → 9956.52] worked on um
[9956.52 → 9967.48] I've kept the case for me, it's like not really fair because of our deal that seems to come with cases
[9967.48 → 9974.52] yeah he gets new computers in perpetuity I guess yeah it doesn't say how often you offered it I could
[9974.52 → 9984.04] i could do nothing no there are 45 years there is part of the clause is there how often do I have to do it it's its not a timing thing, but it's a keeping it in pace with yours
[9984.04 → 9991.16] really yeah it's not supposed to be the same you were just that narcissistic back than
[9994.60 → 10000.20] but it's supposed to be like you know reasonably within range that makes sense I don't remember the
[10000.20 → 10007.32] exact wording that checks out something what do you have now 40 40 80 oh you're good then I'm not
[10007.32 → 10011.72] complaining I think you have a better computer than me right now then maybe yeah I have an oh
[10012.36 → 10018.60] 7900 ATX probably about on par pretty darn close pretty similar yeah yours is better in ray
[10018.60 → 10025.24] tracing which I don't think you use anyway so cool um yeah yeah yeah not complaining as
[10025.24 → 10034.52] for me, i I have changed my case very few times I had an adtech land boy that was my first custom
[10034.52 → 10041.88] computer case with the smart blue 350 watt power supply so that's what I had I upgraded that to an
[10041.88 → 10051.48] Nantes p160 I got the NCI didn't carry the p160w, but they did carry the windowed side panel
[10051.48 → 10057.72] replacement so I had an extra non-windowed side panel it was a really cool windowed side panel um instead of
[10057.72 → 10067.64] being flat uh it had these like I don't know these like ovals in it here we go um I don't know they
[10067.64 → 10073.72] were just they were kind of cool they were like stylish oh yeah indent things and like the locks
[10073.72 → 10079.48] for the side panel were indented into it so you couldn't just like to put a window on the regular case
[10079.48 → 10083.72] you had to oh you had to get the had to get the stock window it looked really sick
[10083.72 → 10090.36] um so I had one of these i actually I swapped out the LED colour in the front so mine instead of
[10090.36 → 10095.64] having blue LEDs uh lighting up these little front mirrored bits I swapped them out for green
[10095.64 → 10103.08] I had a cool AMD inside UV reactive logo in the bottom I rattle can spray the inside black
[10103.80 → 10111.88] um what other modifications I had an I had a fan controller um in the front I think that's I think
[10111.88 → 10118.76] that's most of it I had oh I had a cool uh UV green transparent acrylic cover for my power supply
[10118.76 → 10124.52] and then I had UV green sleeving for my power supply back when I had this build anyway from there
[10125.88 → 10132.60] from there I think I went to the I think I went straight to the tj07 Yvonne bought that for me
[10133.24 → 10138.28] that's that's how you know she's a keeper she gets you like a sick computer case and then I still have
[10138.28 → 10142.76] that i kind of still want to do a build in it one of these days and doing that unboxing of the murder
[10142.76 → 10148.84] box uh made me want to do it even more yeah it was a thing I was walking through the lab and was like
[10150.28 → 10156.04] three pallets of murder boxes I mean mbx2 or whatever they ended up calling them
[10157.08 → 10162.84] they're they're the tj07 but refined perfected you might say and then from my tj07 I went to my rack
[10162.84 → 10170.52] mount case which I have like for a for like tech influencer or whatever I have kept for an awfully
[10170.52 → 10177.64] long time without making anything other than like slight quality of life modifications to i I love it
[10177.64 → 10181.72] it's perfect my computer sits in my rack I never look at it or think about it other than when it's broken
[10183.16 → 10188.36] and maybe that's I don't know maybe that's kind of lame I do want to do a really nice build for the
[10188.36 → 10197.56] theatre room you need something for the theatre room um and I want it to be like dead quiet like
[10197.56 → 10208.20] yeah silent yes maybe even silent and deadly oh yes one thing i kind of button is a power button
[10208.20 → 10216.12] the other button ejects a knife I mean why a knife you can only kill one person with a knife if it
[10216.12 → 10222.52] ejected a grenade that was sort of true okay then the knife has mustard gas in the handle
[10224.92 → 10231.72] I like the floor is made of bleach and the knife has ammonia in it okay all right so why don't we
[10231.72 → 10237.16] move on to our next merge message good it's easy to get you guys to move on hey guys I'm an injection
[10237.16 → 10244.20] moulding technician and I thoroughly enjoy all the BTS moulding content how much did the older do and how
[10244.20 → 10251.80] much of your team uh how much did you learn personally I learned basically what was in kyle's video
[10252.36 → 10256.52] that we had to open the gate and do more simulation to make sure that it flows through
[10256.52 → 10262.04] the mould like this instead of going around things and then meeting and making those ugly uh those ugly
[10262.04 → 10269.72] lines um I learned about the different properties of plastics, and you know some cool faster and some
[10269.72 → 10274.12] cool longer when they're flowing through the mould or stick to the mould or whatever else
[10275.16 → 10280.44] that's that's about it like i I didn't do any simulations or anything as for what our team has
[10280.44 → 10286.12] learned I will say that some of it was handled by the older, but it was definitely a collaborative
[10286.68 → 10291.00] process i I pretty much promise you that those simulations that we showed in the video were ones that
[10291.00 → 10295.72] our team was running we've learned a lot about plastic injection moulding over the last few years
[10295.72 → 10305.08] here goes a new impulse buy did you need to add any anti-yellowing countermeasures or is that not an
[10305.08 → 10309.80] issue for this type of plastic I'm not aware of that being an issue for triton don't think it's a
[10309.80 → 10316.04] problem for triton looking at especially like okay so a very well-known brand that uses triton
[10316.04 → 10322.44] Neogene their water bottles you know water bottles these days a lot of people use them inside but
[10322.44 → 10328.28] for a long time they were like largely outdoor or indoor sports facility type water bottle culture
[10328.28 → 10332.60] has changed a lot dramatically changed I didn't even really think about, but they did go outside a lot
[10332.60 → 10334.84] and Neogene bottles never really changed colour
[10338.44 → 10345.16] now you know usually blue for a reason that's an interesting point but who the devil is this
[10345.16 → 10352.60] who are you number 317 anonymous with your 10 gift card purchase
[10356.92 → 10365.56] go ahead Dan you can read it are you sure yeah it's very mean is it maybe Linus also known as moo, moo the cow
[10365.56 → 10373.32] how do you know that oh this is the thing that's my OG Hotmail account damn
[10374.76 → 10380.84] moo, moo underscore the underscore cow at hotmail.com I don't have that email address anymore don't bother
[10380.84 → 10389.96] emailing it, but that was my original like when I went to camp squid for bible camp you know
[10389.96 → 10396.04] that was the email that I gave to my fellow attendees so they could stay in touch is uh
[10397.16 → 10407.48] you said anonymous 13. 317 is the order number oh not the name that they put in no, no sorry carry on
[10409.96 → 10415.96] damn uh do you find the existence or lack of your beard to have any effect on your viewership
[10415.96 → 10420.28] and do you still plan uh do you still have plans taking your name out of the branding of your
[10420.28 → 10426.44] company um I don't know we're kind of I think we're kind of experimenting right now um I am
[10427.16 → 10435.00] see I'm actually not quite done painting my bike I have put one back off maybe I put one coat of clear
[10435.00 → 10443.88] coat on the gas tank uh and then I made the mistake okay this is why Jake they drives me nuts because he
[10443.88 → 10449.64] was like no you should sand it you know like fine sand it and I was like no I'm not going to bother
[10449.64 → 10453.24] I don't care if there's a little bit of orange peel I want this project done he's like no you should do
[10453.24 → 10458.52] it and then I did the first coat of clear coat on the gas tank and there was like a little something
[10458.52 → 10465.00] like a little fluff got caught in it and i I could have sprayed it again and maybe like gotten that
[10465.00 → 10469.24] bit out but probably not I probably would have scuffed the finish so I was going to have to do another
[10469.24 → 10473.88] coat anyway so I was like okay well I'll just leave it with the one coat and then I'll, I'll get
[10473.88 → 10478.60] the little bit out and then I'll blast the second coat, and then it'll all be consistent I won't have
[10478.60 → 10483.96] the little like fluff or the little nib in it anyway as I was getting out the nib I was like oh I mean
[10483.96 → 10487.72] it wouldn't really hurt if i I'm just a thousand grit I can't really damage anything too badly I'll give
[10487.72 → 10494.52] it is like a like kind of a once over, and it looks so much better but now I'm thinking I've only delivered
[10494.52 → 10500.36] the wheels the frame and the subframe none of which I think stand out that much once the bike
[10500.36 → 10504.76] is assembled it's going to be the fairing it's going to be the tail it's going to be the gas tank
[10504.76 → 10509.64] that are really going to stand out so I still have all those pieces technically they haven't started
[10509.64 → 10516.60] reassembly yet so technically you could, I could sand everything fine grit sand everything do you know
[10516.60 → 10521.48] when they're going to start blast it again and polish it do you have like this weekend and then that's it
[10521.48 → 10528.52] I don't know but I did a thousand grit the gas tank and like I don't want to get in there with like
[10528.52 → 10533.00] two thousand like five thousand grit like i I don't I don't know I don't have time for that
[10533.88 → 10538.68] um yes I know it looks better wet sanded yes, yes yes it's worth if it's worth it
[10539.88 → 10545.96] um anyway so if that's the case I'm going to have to I'm going to have to do a fair bit more clear coating
[10545.96 → 10551.16] if it was just going to be like hitting the gas tank once then I was just going to like to put on the
[10551.48 → 10556.92] mask and like you know breathe as little as I can and not bother but if I'm is I'm going to be
[10556.92 → 10560.68] clear coating the entire rest of the bike again I'm probably going to have to shave the beard so we'll
[10560.68 → 10568.20] see we'll see maybe I'll keep a moustache for like one week it'd be horrible dude it would be bad it
[10568.20 → 10574.52] would be horrible on me anyway okay I'm trying to wait even I can't even I feel like I can't even
[10574.52 → 10578.92] imagine it still plan to take my name out of branding of the company eventually yes that is still the goal
[10578.92 → 10583.88] don't think about it Luke i kind of want to close your mind's eye I feel like I can imagine
[10583.88 → 10591.56] myself with one easier than I can imagine you with one nope it's gross nope I don't like it
[10592.68 → 10599.40] you have to do it uh hello from Tampa returning from Saudi Arabia we could both do it for November
[10599.40 → 10610.20] nope all right do it now look at my razors uh hello from Tampa returning from Saudi Arabia
[10611.32 → 10616.52] three security agents spent 30 minutes inspecting my mini it build from my carry-on what are some
[10616.52 → 10624.44] challenges you faced with equipment at airports the biggest one is the carnet it's this stupid piece of
[10624.44 → 10631.56] paper that it's I think it's Canadian customs insists on or is it you I can't remember someone
[10631.56 → 10636.12] insists on us having this stupid piece of paper that we bring to the airport and write down the
[10636.12 → 10641.64] serial numbers of all the like camera filming equipment that we bring with us and then when we
[10641.64 → 10647.88] come back we have to show them the carnet and that this is all equipment that we took with us in the
[10647.88 → 10655.48] first place that we're not importing it, but it's just a piece of paper there 's's no tracking
[10656.04 → 10662.04] there's no validation and many of the agents don't even know about it so it's just a matter of like if
[10662.04 → 10667.32] you get the one that cares then they'll like hassle you about all the gear that you're taking over there
[10667.32 → 10672.76] even though you're clearly a professional video equipment person you don't you don't even have more
[10672.76 → 10682.12] than one of the same thing you're obviously not an importer it's just a big waste of time it means
[10682.12 → 10686.76] our camera ops have to show up at the airport like an hour sometimes an hour and a half earlier it's
[10686.76 → 10691.48] just so obnoxious uh it's not an airplane but I'm going to tell the story anyway because it's probably
[10691.48 → 10698.76] been a long time but one time I had to for reasons uh transport my mineral oil computer from
[10698.76 → 10706.12] Vancouver Island to back home and I didn't have a car on the island so I had to bring it onto a bus
[10706.12 → 10712.52] so I had to hand carry on a wooden plank my mineral computer that had like at the time
[10713.72 → 10719.56] fish plants in it and stuff but also just computer parts and cables and all this wacky stuff absolute
[10719.56 → 10724.20] genius the bus driver absolutely did not want to let me on the bus because he thought it was a bomb
[10724.20 → 10730.76] um and i actually I got on the bus but i I don't remember how I don't know if he just eventually
[10730.76 → 10737.88] kind of gave up and let me or what I don't I don't remember at this point but yeah I got it
[10737.88 → 10742.20] on the bus eventually and I got it home but I mean then I had to take it on the ferry and then all this
[10742.20 → 10747.48] kind of stuff, and it got uh you know I got some looks you got some looks that's probably heavy as hell
[10747.48 → 10753.96] it wasn't light it wasn't particularly light there uh part of the spoiler of the story is that it
[10753.96 → 10759.96] didn't exactly have oil in it at that point in time or at least not a lot um but it is the oil was
[10759.96 → 10763.56] soaked into the wooden plank and I was carrying a computer on a plank for like
[10764.44 → 10769.00] plus the aquarium factor many hours yeah ridiculous yeah
[10771.16 → 10776.84] yeah howdy LDL from Texas love the screwdriver and buying one for my dad question
[10776.84 → 10783.48] AI makes call scams harder to detect how can we verify who we're speaking to maybe encryption
[10783.48 → 10791.48] keys or back to the old safe words safe words and just don't uh don't do anything
[10791.48 → 10797.88] when people call you yeah you can always call people back look up their number and call them back
[10797.88 → 10803.00] don't forget they could be sim jacked so even calling them back oh no don't call their direct
[10803.00 → 10808.52] number back just don't um like if your bank calls you or something like that oh I was talking like
[10808.52 → 10812.20] a like a loved one because you couldn't have a safe word with your bank I think they're talking
[10812.20 → 10819.08] about yeah like if you know your wife calls you saying she's held ransom or whatever enough
[10819.08 → 10823.96] I'm sure you could call who I'm sure for the company bank account you could have a safe word to be
[10823.96 → 10833.48] honest i I don't know you'd be surprised how inflexible um like policy is at places like we're
[10833.48 → 10840.12] we're uh again this comes down to that whole age-old debate is Linus media group a big
[10840.12 → 10848.84] company yeah in the in the scheme of like would bank just like have a special policy for us
[10848.84 → 10855.08] no it's funny because there are some that would little tiny credit unions but like
[10855.88 → 10861.88] not, not big maybe, but that's our issue is we're big enough that there's no way we could engage
[10861.88 → 10866.04] reasonably with a bank like that simply because they don't they wouldn't deal in enough
[10866.04 → 10876.60] currency for us oh we deal in GBP euro uh cad USD at least and I'm pro there's probably some oh yeah
[10876.60 → 10882.52] no we definitely have um yen Australian dollar yeah we have Chinese yuan as well Swedish króna
[10883.48 → 10890.76] we deal in all these different currencies so no idea we absolutely have to deal with like a mega
[10890.76 → 10895.80] a mega bank um just because of all the different income streams that are coming from like Amazon
[10895.80 → 10901.00] affiliate Australia or whatever right I don't even know if that's a thing, but that's an example of the
[10901.00 → 10907.32] kind of reason that we might have some international currency coming in and um, but we are not big
[10907.32 → 10912.84] enough for any organization like that to give two and a limp about us so
[10916.04 → 10919.72] two separate trips or like one so we're in this there are three people
[10919.72 → 10927.40] so we're just uh yeah I don't know we're in the like we're in like a weird middle ground and I'm
[10927.40 → 10933.00] not I'm not complaining I'm just saying that there have been times that it's been challenging
[10933.00 → 10941.24] like I remember when I wasn't able to borrow like literally a few months of of of revenue for like
[10941.24 → 10946.44] uh for some reason for the business just because they like didn't recognize what kind of
[10946.44 → 10951.40] business we were it didn't matter it didn't matter that I'd be able to pay it back in a trivial amount
[10951.40 → 10962.44] of time didn't matter we just couldn't because we're nobody yep all right hit me all right let's
[10962.44 → 10970.04] see yeah hi LLD about to receive a utility patent any advice for getting a device from prototype to
[10970.04 → 10975.64] finished product any pitfalls to avoid clear driver will go great with my OG black shaft driver thanks
[10977.08 → 10986.68] any advice for getting it to finish product be patient time I submit do it right um understand
[10986.68 → 10995.96] that there may be compromises to be made along the way for instance there is one compromise on this
[10995.96 → 11002.68] there's almost no way that you guys would be able to see it, but there's like um around the
[11002.68 → 11012.60] uh the bits of the um the ratchet mechanism like the metal um like spine that comes out of the
[11012.60 → 11018.04] housing here there's kind of like um like a thin part of the wall it goes all the way around so it
[11018.04 → 11022.76] doesn't really like it doesn't matter you know but I know it's there it wasn't what we were trying to
[11022.76 → 11028.84] do we wanted it to sit cleaner to the um I don't know what you're talking about yeah it doesn't
[11028.84 → 11035.08] matter it doesn't matter it's better if no one else can find it, but the point is there will be
[11035.08 → 11040.76] little compromises be ready for that but also stick to your guns when it comes to quality never compromise
[11040.76 → 11052.04] on the long lastingness of the product um I don't know as for pitfalls to avoid oh man um
[11053.64 → 11059.16] you know carefully QC what you get back from the factory make sure it's actually what you ask them
[11059.16 → 11066.68] for I still remember the first time we got a sample driver from um the Chinese manufacturer that we
[11066.68 → 11072.20] switched to from the Taiwanese ratchet manufacturer, and it was like okay but not quite right and it
[11072.20 → 11077.80] turned out that they had somehow never gotten our drawings and had just cloned it based on the sample
[11077.80 → 11084.68] product we sent instead of creating it from the drawings, and it was close enough that we couldn't
[11084.68 → 11090.28] tell wild that that was a default action yeah they didn't go oh you don't have drawings or anything
[11090.28 → 11095.00] they're just like yeah we got it we knew it was like we knew it was wrong, but we couldn't tell why
[11095.00 → 11105.00] it was that close wow that's wild hi the cat distribution system sent a six-month-old cat my
[11105.00 → 11112.36] way she adapted well to the home and to me but is spicy with my resident old cats Linus any tips from
[11112.36 → 11119.64] your shed kitten rescue into intro better no I mean they'll be the first thing anyone ever says to me is
[11119.64 → 11124.92] try to fell away I found it really expensive and doesn't especially do anything the heck is that
[11124.92 → 11131.64] um it's like a cat pheromone that you just put into a wall plug like those plug-in air fresheners um
[11132.60 → 11137.16] I just have not observed any difference in my cat's behaviour across like half a dozen different
[11137.16 → 11141.72] cats now and i just I don't believe in it um I'm sure someone somewhere has had success with it but i
[11141.72 → 11149.16] just haven't as for um how things have gone with our cats our resident older lady cat uh was extremely
[11149.16 → 11154.36] aggressive with the new ones, and she now lives with my aunt um that doesn't mean we don't love her anymore
[11154.36 → 11161.48] and it doesn't mean that we don't go to see her but uh she is much happier as a single cat household
[11161.48 → 11167.16] kitty and that was what was best for her and honestly my aunt is also thriving with dash living
[11167.16 → 11174.36] with her um I've I've told my aunt that she's a crazy cat lady in training for like 20 years now and
[11174.36 → 11180.36] uh it was just a matter of convincing my uncle but dash is just the coolest cat and within about
[11180.36 → 11185.56] three days he was telling my aunt they know they're not getting this cat back right so she's in an
[11185.56 → 11190.52] extremely loving home and one of the things my aunt was concerned about is that they're getting on in
[11190.52 → 11198.44] years, and so we made it very clear to her that if anything were to happen um dash will come back to us
[11198.44 → 11205.40] and we'll just figure out how to integrate them better hello oh yeah sorry go for it uh I have a
[11205.40 → 11211.88] message from sir Conrad merch message anonymous button is fixed it was an issue on the U.S. site
[11212.68 → 11219.40] due to an app that we don't use anyway so he just installed the app uh and the flow point
[11219.40 → 11226.68] auth button is on the global site now yes because the sick the one who called you Mr moo, moo something
[11226.68 → 11228.84] or other what's his name again conked
[11228.84 → 11239.88] instead of Conrad oh okay that's good you get a ding for that he's a chad I thought you said
[11239.88 → 11249.48] calm no I was like what's going on yeah um hello Newcomb dynes and LAN Linus with your
[11250.20 → 11257.32] motorcycle being done soon I ride a cruiser style Yamaha and regularly do iron butt rides every year
[11257.32 → 11264.20] what's the longest ride you've done on your bike uh iron butt not a particularly long ride but i
[11264.20 → 11269.88] don't ride a particularly comfortable bike i am ruins cape I went straight down to Seattle from
[11269.88 → 11276.68] Vancouver and that was the longest no stops um trip that I've taken on my motorbike I'm not like an avid
[11276.68 → 11281.80] rider I don't like go riding for the weekend or anything like that um don't really have time
[11281.80 → 11289.24] I'd love to armour trimming on a bicycle uh it's a 2003 SV 650s
[11291.24 → 11298.92] jokes for six people okay let's see morning LLD I work in a secure office which means no Wi-Fi
[11298.92 → 11304.92] or Bluetooth devices I would still like a device to track and remind me of meetings do you have any
[11304.92 → 11313.00] ideas I've been looking at electronic organizers from the 90s yeah those track and remind me of
[11313.00 → 11320.68] meetings would they accept a device that has the Wi-Fi Bluetooth chipset taken out of it
[11323.80 → 11330.20] that's a good question it seems like a reasonable thing to do
[11330.20 → 11335.00] uh if they had a person who was capable of making sure that they were removed properly
[11335.00 → 11339.32] that is probably the biggest problem so you need something that by default doesn't have that despite
[11339.32 → 11341.80] the ability to add that to things yeah
[11345.96 → 11351.88] this is probably a secure office not like a military spec you are not allowed to have things
[11351.88 → 11361.16] on you, and we will scan you and search you I mean I know there's like there's like digital watches
[11361.16 → 11366.52] that have no smart capabilities that have like multiple alarms okay I didn't know the multiple
[11366.52 → 11371.16] alarms part that's why I didn't actually say it yeah um
[11374.76 → 11381.64] yeah virtual said I says that's not surprising we are told that even wireless keyboards are a security
[11381.64 → 11387.80] risk some offices are crazy um Luke that's what we should do on top of threat locker is ban all
[11387.80 → 11397.00] wireless devices nice okay Roger says likely not if this is a if then the device has to be on
[11397.00 → 11404.60] approved lists from the government interesting yeah no i I don't know your information facility
[11404.60 → 11409.80] is that what's yeah vintage palm pilot I think man a lot of those older pocket pcs and stuff though they
[11409.80 → 11417.00] had Wi-Fi you'd have to go quite old yeah 90s like i think you could get an apple newton
[11417.00 → 11423.24] no I think even that oh no yeah it doesn't have Wi-Fi it doesn't have Wi-Fi uh it would be so cool
[11423.24 → 11429.64] if you rocked up with an apple newton that would be sick apple newton that's my official recommendation
[11429.64 → 11441.08] let's go I second that okay hi dopamine serotonin hi dopamine serotonin and oxytocin you
[11441.08 → 11447.16] have mentioned having lots of games in your steam libraries which you have not had a chance to play
[11447.16 → 11453.08] what were some of the hidden gems once you played them I actually did a whole video really yep
[11453.08 → 11462.68] and then uh i never actually i in the video I was like here I am trying every unplayed game in my
[11462.68 → 11468.28] steam backlog I did this four years ago it was really fun and I found a bunch of games that I was
[11468.28 → 11476.92] like oh I'm going to come back and play this one never did oh you can favourite things in steam I know i
[11476.92 → 11482.28] know I need to go back and re-watch this video now so that I know which ones I wanted to play yeah
[11484.04 → 11490.12] Luke I had a shared account just like that on steam only I was the one who ended up with the
[11490.12 → 11495.64] account in the end so did he yeah it was a blast seeing uh the new games and giving them a try for
[11495.64 → 11505.48] free nice honestly it's its it was surprisingly like fun and uh the last one I've got for you tonight
[11505.48 → 11512.04] is Luke have you started any new Final Fantasy games yet no but I'm going to play tactics
[11513.08 → 11517.64] oh are you going which one are you gonna play
[11520.20 → 11526.12] isn't there well no the one coming to steam so they're okay, okay that was the plan not the only
[11526.12 → 11530.84] version okay so I would say that playing the pixel remaster for Final Fantasy 6 was actually a mistake
[11530.84 → 11535.64] I wouldn't say you should like to replay it at this point because that whatever um replay it I'm not
[11535.64 → 11542.04] playing it again I know I wouldn't say you should replay it but i if I were to go back and tell you
[11542.04 → 11547.80] you got to play this game again I would have you play the original SNES version oh I see um so for
[11547.80 → 11553.88] tactics obviously I haven't played the new one yet but there are actually now I would say three valid
[11553.88 → 11560.92] choices for playing Final Fantasy tactics one would be obviously the new one that's coming to steam
[11560.92 → 11569.64] another would be Final Fantasy tactics for PlayStation one the original release and the other
[11569.64 → 11572.20] would be Final Fantasy tactics war of the lions
[11574.92 → 11577.48] so war of the lions um
[11577.48 → 11589.16] is this a remaster or is this a different game so it was kind of it was kind of a re-release slash
[11589.16 → 11596.44] android uh well no it's for the PSP android iOS it says since when is that for what I don't know it's
[11596.44 → 11603.56] which was both of them don't worry about that it's for the PSP uh it was released in 1997 and is
[11603.56 → 11611.80] considered by many to be kind of the um I don't know the definitive version of Final Fantasy tactics
[11612.44 → 11621.00] however as someone who never actually played war of the lions um I can't, I can't tell you that I think
[11621.00 → 11627.88] any of the things they added to it would improve anything oh well look at that you can get war of
[11627.88 → 11635.32] the lions for uh for iOS and android okay that's cool but I wouldn't say that anything that I can
[11635.32 → 11642.84] see that they added to it um would significantly improve the game for me, it has a less Jacky translation
[11642.84 → 11649.24] but in my opinion I enjoy that I enjoy the lankier translation in my opinion the original Jacky
[11649.24 → 11655.16] translation aside from a couple cases where meanings can be obscured a little bit um is part of its
[11655.16 → 11665.00] charm and don't sell me a dog drugstore cowboy and some of the like new characters just what no one's
[11665.00 → 11673.00] going to understand that reference, but yeah just felt like kind of cringy um fan service
[11673.00 → 11682.52] so you could there are a couple new classes but like they seem pretty op I'm googling it
[11684.44 → 11687.08] no one cares okay look play whatever version of the game you want
[11687.08 → 11699.24] I don't really like playing games on my phone no you can, I'm just thinking it's PSP emulators yeah
[11699.24 → 11705.64] yeah so you've got three you've got three valid options to play and I'm afraid to recommend
[11705.64 → 11708.60] evils chronicles that the re-release
[11708.60 → 11716.68] don't sell me a dog don't sell me a dog drugstore cowboy with a huge crest in the middle for some
[11716.68 → 11723.32] reason uh this isn't the exact one but I saw this on a shirt on a hat in Taiwan my first time the
[11723.32 → 11727.40] second time there and I bought it for Emma i still have that's uh that's good I like
[11728.52 → 11733.72] so here's something and yeah Sydney broke it is saying this in chat the remake is removing a bunch of
[11733.72 → 11740.92] the fan service things in war of the lions so it's apparently meant to be there was apparently
[11740.92 → 11746.44] the source code was lost is that right you guys so they ended up having it's very much like
[11746.44 → 11754.36] a fan service game but was initiated by like someone from the original team like replaying it
[11754.36 → 11758.44] again and being like no this is the definitive version and wanting to bring it to
[11758.44 → 11765.80] modern platforms instead of war of the lions which um yeah apparently it'll include a classic version
[11765.80 → 11771.48] yeah apparently uh oh okay no I think they I think i I thought I was reading that they lost at least some
[11772.12 → 11776.76] of the source apparently evils chronicles will include two different versions of the game enhanced
[11776.76 → 11782.68] and classic so which would you play enhanced or classic so i I need to really get through the
[11782.68 → 11788.76] details of the details of the changes if it's just graphics honestly I don't care there was a mode
[11788.76 → 11792.92] where you could kind of see the old graphics on the pixel remaster and I was like
[11795.96 → 11803.08] sure you could take either it's fine um, so the classic version of the re-release will have the war
[11803.08 → 11807.56] of the lions' translation though so if you want the original PlayStation kind of Jacky translation
[11808.12 → 11812.04] you'll have to emulate PlayStation one which can be done very easily these days
[11812.68 → 11821.08] you have time to decide maybe I'll buy the steam one and then emulate it yeah that's that's a valid
[11821.08 → 11825.88] choice because I never bought this back in the day opinion I don't have any like I didn't have any
[11825.88 → 11830.60] Final Fantasy i the only game I had was Final Fantasy eight oh here's a fun piracy conversation sure
[11831.24 → 11839.16] I own a Final Fantasy tactics disc for PlayStation one oh if I lent you my give me the disc and I didn't
[11839.16 → 11844.12] play the game while you were playing it that's valid I'd be okay with that you'd be okay emulating
[11844.12 → 11851.56] it yep well I won't because technically I have an old PlayStation they oh this is interesting people
[11851.56 → 11856.84] are like valid chat says valid I think it's fine chat says valid I think it's fine well I'm not I'm
[11856.84 → 11861.00] not giving it to you because I actually love that they're remastering the original game, and they should
[11861.00 → 11864.52] get money for it yeah I'm cool with that so I'm not going to lend you the game I'm fine with that but
[11864.52 → 11869.72] yeah it's one of the handful of like retro games that I own actually I think I bought it from David
[11869.72 → 11873.64] when he did his liquidation sale I was like oh you have Final Fantasy tactics I've played this game
[11873.64 → 11878.20] like three times and I've never owned a copy I feel bad I would either go to willow and buy my own old
[11878.20 → 11884.60] school copy or I think it is also fair in my opinion to buy the new one and then just emulate the old
[11884.60 → 11890.28] one I think that's fine okay that is that my brain is okay with that you know what my brain's okay with
[11890.28 → 11896.28] telling you guys hey we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[11904.20 → 11905.64] I was only three hours today
[11909.24 → 11911.80] I make the old rain show the five-hour long
[11913.72 → 11915.80] you get over four hours laughing
