[2025-06-07T19:09:51Z] Video: Okay We HAVE To Talk About This - WAN Show June 6, 2025 
I've come across Graphy 3D printed aligners in my work. They are a super cool (and super expensive) option but it's well worth the deep dive. I'd love to see a LTT video on 4th gen aligner tech. The timestamps even say braces - these aren't braces. These are packed with tech - from the scanning, planning, design, manifacturing, all the way to tracking.
