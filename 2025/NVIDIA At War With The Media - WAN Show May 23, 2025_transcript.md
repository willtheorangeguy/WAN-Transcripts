[0.00 --> 4.06]  Um, that's not what this page is supposed to look like.
[5.36 --> 7.98]  What is up, you delightful marshmallow chickens?
[8.72 --> 9.54]  That's right.
[9.96 --> 12.24]  Y'all my peeps, and we're here coming to you live.
[12.24 --> 13.36]  Y'all my peeps?
[17.32 --> 23.06]  We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week in classic NVIDIA fashion.
[23.06 --> 29.00]  They are currently at war with what seems like basically the entire tech media.
[29.00 --> 33.68]  We'll be talking about what's going on and also about how none of this is new.
[34.40 --> 35.68]  Cool, go NVIDIA.
[36.34 --> 40.30]  Also, we'll be talking about some of the really cool stuff we saw here at Computex.
[41.70 --> 43.20]  Okay, there wasn't that much of that.
[43.28 --> 48.22]  We'll be talking about some of the zany stuff that we saw while we were here at Computex in Taiwan.
[48.90 --> 50.66]  What else we got this week, Mr. Luke?
[51.68 --> 55.92]  The German courts are doing genuinely very cool things.
[56.28 --> 57.18]  We both linked to this.
[57.18 --> 58.56]  At least one cool thing.
[58.56 --> 59.00]  Yeah.
[59.12 --> 63.44]  But it's the coolest thing that I think I've seen in many years out of Germany.
[63.66 --> 64.30]  That's fair.
[64.64 --> 65.50]  And SteamOS moves one...
[65.50 --> 66.92]  I'm not saying the Germans were right.
[69.32 --> 72.80]  SteamOS moves one step closer to a wider release with a new update.
[73.10 --> 73.54]  Thank you.
[74.22 --> 75.08]  Intro button.
[75.64 --> 77.44]  I don't know who does it.
[78.08 --> 79.06]  Good luck, Dan.
[79.24 --> 79.62]  Cool.
[79.62 --> 79.72]  Cool.
[82.76 --> 83.62]  Can you do it?
[84.00 --> 84.42]  Nice.
[84.50 --> 84.72]  It's right.
[84.72 --> 84.78]  Nice.
[84.78 --> 84.84]  Nice.
[84.84 --> 84.90]  Nice.
[84.90 --> 84.96]  Nice.
[84.96 --> 85.02]  Nice.
[85.02 --> 85.04]  Nice.
[85.04 --> 85.06]  Nice.
[85.06 --> 85.08]  Nice.
[85.08 --> 85.62]  Nice.
[85.62 --> 86.08]  Nice.
[86.08 --> 87.02]  Nice.
[87.02 --> 87.08]  Nice.
[87.08 --> 88.02]  Nice.
[88.02 --> 88.48]  Nice.
[88.48 --> 88.98]  Nice.
[99.42 --> 101.36]  Nice.
[101.46 --> 102.46]  Nice.
[102.46 --> 102.86]  Nice.
[102.86 --> 102.98]  Nice.
[102.98 --> 103.46]  Nice.
[103.46 --> 103.54]  Nice.
[103.54 --> 103.90]  Nice.
[103.90 --> 104.06]  Nice.
[104.06 --> 104.50]  Nice.
[104.50 --> 104.54]  Yeah.
[104.54 --> 104.76]  Hi.
[104.76 --> 105.04]  Nice.
[105.04 --> 105.30]  Nice.
[105.30 --> 105.84]  Nice.
[105.84 --> 105.86]  Hi.
[105.86 --> 106.06]  Nice.
[106.06 --> 106.70]  This world's pair of our터 globalization.
[106.70 --> 114.48]  Del and our chair partner, whoever takes this golden chair in our hotel room.
[114.76 --> 115.74]  No, no, it's Secret Lab.
[115.84 --> 116.50]  It's Secret Lab.
[117.84 --> 122.06]  Okay, we are off to a really good start today.
[122.06 --> 122.70]  It's fantastic.
[123.38 --> 125.14]  What do you want to get into first?
[125.14 --> 125.54]  No problems.
[125.94 --> 131.44]  Should we talk about NVIDIA's little kerfuffle with reviewers?
[131.78 --> 132.16]  Sure.
[132.34 --> 136.38]  I guess their being nice before 5000 series drops is just over.
[136.38 --> 137.92]  Why don't we, no, no.
[138.04 --> 141.10]  Why don't we talk about other Computex GPU things?
[141.22 --> 148.24]  Because there was actually a fair bit to like about, well, there was a fair bit to be pretty okay with about GPUs at Computex.
[148.26 --> 149.48]  The Intel stuff is interesting.
[150.00 --> 150.82]  Well, yeah.
[151.38 --> 151.64]  Yeah.
[151.70 --> 152.46]  Are you going to buy one?
[153.86 --> 154.26]  No.
[154.56 --> 154.92]  Cool.
[155.06 --> 156.04]  But I wasn't going to buy one anyways.
[156.16 --> 159.10]  AMD revealed the 9060 XT.
[159.22 --> 162.36]  It's going to be launching June 5th, which is in just a couple of weeks.
[162.36 --> 168.84]  The 8GB version is $299, and we're not super stoked on that.
[169.20 --> 183.72]  But the 16GB version is at an MSRP anyway of $349 with, yes, okay, it's only a 128-bit bus card, which used to mean it would be like $130, not $350.
[183.72 --> 191.90]  But it's, the performance looks pretty darn okay.
[192.54 --> 199.70]  And AMD is even like decent at ray tracing, and they've got like all the upscaling technology and all of that.
[199.70 --> 203.26]  So if you're into that, then you can turn all of that stuff on.
[203.44 --> 204.92]  I mean, that's pretty neat.
[205.58 --> 211.10]  I know a lot of people are really upset that there's even an 8GB version of the card at all.
[211.36 --> 214.12]  But can I play devil's advocate for a moment here?
[215.76 --> 216.20]  No.
[217.00 --> 218.28]  Okay, let's move on.
[218.62 --> 221.44]  Intel announced the ARC Pro B60.
[221.66 --> 221.94]  Really?
[222.42 --> 223.08]  I mean, yeah, you can.
[223.08 --> 224.02]  You're just not going to let me?
[224.08 --> 224.54]  If you want.
[224.64 --> 227.60]  No, I mean, look, if that's the dynamic you want to have, I'm okay.
[227.60 --> 230.72]  I've, you know, we could get some leather.
[231.06 --> 231.30]  You like that?
[231.38 --> 231.48]  Yeah.
[233.54 --> 234.26]  Oh, boy.
[235.50 --> 237.68]  Well, it's going to be one of those kinds of jokes today.
[240.64 --> 242.28]  Conveniently, there's a bed right here.
[243.80 --> 244.72]  Poor Andy.
[247.40 --> 248.26]  Yeah, Andy.
[248.26 --> 256.04]  I heard that if you do that kind of work, you basically can never find, like, you know, non-pornographic work ever again.
[256.14 --> 257.54]  Is that going to be a problem for you?
[257.60 --> 258.20]  Is that a thing?
[259.40 --> 260.10]  I don't know.
[260.20 --> 262.72]  Couldn't you just not put it on your resume or does it, like, get around?
[263.10 --> 268.36]  I mean, I, I, I, I, are you expecting me to know?
[268.36 --> 269.44]  See, like, we might never know.
[269.50 --> 269.82]  Like, am I supposed to?
[269.82 --> 272.02]  Maybe he's done this kind of work under the table.
[272.26 --> 274.26]  I was one day only a fan creator.
[274.52 --> 276.08]  Or only, or on top of the table.
[276.26 --> 276.62]  Yeah.
[277.34 --> 282.10]  I mean, the table's got all kinds of surfaces you can get on top of or under.
[282.32 --> 282.74]  It's true.
[282.74 --> 285.24]  Okay, so hold on, hold on.
[285.34 --> 289.34]  Let me play devil's advocate for a moment for the 96DX.
[289.34 --> 289.56]  Yeah.
[290.76 --> 291.20]  8 gig.
[291.20 --> 300.66]  Should we be upset about AMD providing the option for someone to have a crappier GPU at a lower price?
[300.66 --> 305.70]  The thing that gets me is the lower price is still 300, I'm assuming, American dollars.
[305.88 --> 306.16]  Yes.
[306.78 --> 314.58]  And the other thing that also gets me is that AMD just cannot decide what their story is on 8 gig GPUs.
[314.58 --> 322.90]  Because, you know, whenever they have a, you know, a VRAM advantage, they're all like, pathetic.
[324.74 --> 329.30]  Our competitor is full of crap, basically.
[329.42 --> 330.84]  And then when they don't, they're like, oh, it doesn't matter.
[331.02 --> 331.18]  Yeah.
[331.28 --> 334.58]  Then they're like, well, actually, it's fine for 1080p gaming.
[334.58 --> 343.10]  I went with Sammy to a LAN cafe this week and, like, looking at literally all of the games that everyone was playing.
[345.06 --> 346.14]  It doesn't matter.
[346.20 --> 346.78]  It wouldn't matter.
[347.12 --> 351.50]  However, however, counterpoint, I was supposed to be the devil's advocate.
[351.90 --> 354.54]  But I guess we're doing a little role reversal.
[354.54 --> 355.60]  It still doesn't make me happy.
[355.68 --> 359.14]  If I'm spending $300 on a card, I should get 16 gigs of RAM.
[359.22 --> 360.12]  We're into role reversal.
[360.12 --> 360.62]  Come on.
[360.86 --> 361.46]  It also...
[361.46 --> 362.70]  To play those games.
[362.78 --> 363.08]  Switch.
[363.34 --> 365.90]  To play those games that Luke is talking about, right?
[366.08 --> 366.26]  Yeah.
[366.30 --> 371.52]  I could also just be using, I don't know, a 5000 series Radeon card.
[372.56 --> 374.96]  Or, you know, like a...
[374.96 --> 381.00]  Realistically, I could be using, like, a Polaris card to play League of Legends.
[381.00 --> 381.10]  Oh, yeah.
[381.10 --> 381.88]  Like, who cares?
[381.90 --> 383.70]  I mean, you might want high frame rate, though.
[384.26 --> 385.06]  This is true.
[385.18 --> 385.80]  This is true.
[386.16 --> 387.12]  Because a lot of them were playing...
[387.12 --> 389.80]  A lot of them were playing CS 1.6.
[390.90 --> 392.94]  Which was sick.
[393.18 --> 393.48]  Really?
[393.74 --> 394.10]  Yeah.
[394.54 --> 394.84]  1.6?
[394.84 --> 396.12]  There was a mix of...
[397.54 --> 398.36]  2?
[398.86 --> 400.14]  Go 2 or whatever.
[400.42 --> 401.70]  And then 1.6.
[403.22 --> 403.98]  Shut up.
[404.00 --> 404.60]  So sick.
[404.70 --> 405.74]  So, like, no source.
[405.84 --> 410.52]  And they had a LAN version of, like, 1.6 so they could keep playing.
[410.62 --> 412.64]  Dude, is LAN gaming coming?
[412.74 --> 412.98]  Okay.
[413.34 --> 414.12]  Hold on a second.
[414.24 --> 415.38]  Because, shoot.
[415.50 --> 416.04]  This actually...
[416.04 --> 417.00]  Okay, we're going to come back to...
[417.00 --> 418.38]  There was tons of League of Legends.
[418.60 --> 418.80]  Yeah.
[418.80 --> 420.90]  There was tons of Counter-Strike in general.
[421.02 --> 421.14]  Okay.
[421.18 --> 422.16]  There was a little bit of Valorant.
[422.48 --> 426.26]  We're going to come back to GPUs at Computex more broadly.
[426.26 --> 426.44]  Sure.
[426.44 --> 430.12]  And specifically, NVIDIA's whole kerfuffle with the media.
[430.78 --> 435.30]  Because I actually want to completely pivot to another one of our topics.
[435.30 --> 439.06]  And it's going to be quite the pivot.
[439.06 --> 441.06]  Where is...
[441.06 --> 441.52]  Yes.
[441.94 --> 446.16]  The Google DeepMind VO3 video model.
[446.54 --> 446.78]  Okay.
[446.86 --> 451.34]  And I promise you, this is related to people playing LAN versions of CS 1.6.
[451.98 --> 452.50]  Somehow.
[453.18 --> 453.46]  Okay.
[453.96 --> 456.10]  Google DeepMind VO3.
[457.68 --> 458.64]  It's crazy.
[458.64 --> 460.22]  Oh, shoot.
[460.38 --> 461.64]  Is Dan going to screen share?
[461.64 --> 462.52]  We have no screen share.
[462.96 --> 463.24]  No.
[463.56 --> 468.94]  Dan, can you do example from prompt streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe?
[469.24 --> 469.40]  Yep.
[469.40 --> 473.24]  This is absolutely mind-blowing.
[473.70 --> 475.02]  Dan, hit them with that.
[475.16 --> 478.82]  And then I'm going to look over there for when it's done playing.
[478.82 --> 484.28]  Because I got to tell you guys, like, I follow the tech space.
[484.70 --> 490.34]  I'm reasonably attuned with the AIs that the kids are fooling around with.
[490.52 --> 498.02]  If you didn't tell me that this was completely generated, like, the dude in the corner,
[499.46 --> 503.90]  the environment, the player model.
[503.90 --> 510.80]  If you didn't tell me that this was AI generated, I would not know.
[511.62 --> 514.48]  It's going to be really bad.
[515.62 --> 520.72]  And this is just like, this is not even the scariest example.
[521.40 --> 524.20]  Dan, can you queue up that pharmaceutical commercial?
[524.42 --> 525.34]  Oh, this one's brutal.
[525.64 --> 525.94]  Dude.
[526.34 --> 526.66]  Dude.
[527.10 --> 528.08]  This is incredible.
[528.34 --> 528.56]  Okay.
[528.64 --> 530.12]  I'm going to not talk over this one.
[533.90 --> 538.80]  Oh, as soon as Dan's ready.
[540.00 --> 540.76]  Thing worked.
[541.10 --> 542.32]  Every day felt heavy.
[542.78 --> 543.62]  I felt trapped.
[543.76 --> 544.14]  Playing now.
[544.24 --> 545.56]  Then I tried Puppermen.
[546.04 --> 551.42]  Our prescription helps your body secrete a special pheromone that attracts puppies.
[552.06 --> 553.88]  I took the pill before bed.
[554.34 --> 558.10]  And when I woke up, there he was, the love of my life.
[558.76 --> 561.14]  The pill does not target depression directly.
[561.14 --> 561.32]  Okay, you can go ahead and cut it, Dan.
[561.68 --> 562.58]  But we found that it's...
[562.58 --> 563.00]  Back to us.
[564.82 --> 568.10]  There's people in chat being like, wait, this is generated.
[568.30 --> 570.54]  So Zenith is like, yeah, that looks like AI.
[570.92 --> 573.26]  This is going to fool over 90% of people.
[573.54 --> 574.14]  Over 90?
[574.46 --> 578.06]  This is going to fool over 99% of people.
[578.38 --> 579.70]  There's a couple little things.
[580.44 --> 583.04]  Like the dog's tongue.
[583.34 --> 583.52]  Yeah.
[583.58 --> 584.50]  When he's licking the guy.
[584.72 --> 586.00]  It's like a little oddly lagged.
[586.00 --> 587.30]  It does some stuff.
[587.40 --> 588.40]  It does some weird stuff.
[588.40 --> 595.94]  I don't think we saw it, but I think there's two ladies sitting on a couch and the one part of her hair doesn't move with her head while the other part does.
[596.18 --> 597.56]  There's little things.
[597.56 --> 598.62]  There's little things.
[598.62 --> 606.66]  But that was made with apparently $500 worth of credits.
[606.98 --> 607.20]  Yep.
[609.60 --> 610.60]  That's wild.
[610.70 --> 613.76]  Which like that means in a year or two.
[613.76 --> 615.28]  And buddy who made it.
[615.28 --> 621.62]  So at PJACCETTURO over on Twitter.
[622.28 --> 626.48]  PJA says, I used to shoot half million dollar pharmaceutical commercials.
[626.48 --> 632.20]  I made this for $500 in VO3 credits in less than a day.
[633.74 --> 640.96]  He also says, okay, I hate this, but he also says, what's the argument for spending $500,000 now?
[641.30 --> 643.32]  And like, I hate that.
[643.54 --> 644.54]  He's not wrong.
[644.62 --> 647.34]  He's not the only person asking that question.
[647.52 --> 647.68]  Yeah.
[647.92 --> 649.10]  And I promise.
[649.10 --> 654.62]  And you know, the whole ethics conversation around pharmaceutical companies.
[654.62 --> 656.68]  I suspect they're not going to mind.
[657.08 --> 662.36]  Especially when, I don't know if you've seen it, but almost every American pharmaceutical company spends more on marketing than they do on R&D.
[663.98 --> 669.14]  So like, if they can drop that marketing budget and not increase the R&D budget.
[669.52 --> 671.26]  Then surely they could lower prices.
[674.44 --> 675.28]  Let's go.
[678.38 --> 678.86]  Okay.
[679.22 --> 683.52]  So we're going to come back to the other stuff in our Google I.O. roundup.
[683.52 --> 686.30]  Because that's the only part of it that I wanted to talk about.
[686.58 --> 689.46]  That yes, I am tying back to people playing LAN games.
[692.32 --> 693.34]  I have a theory.
[694.56 --> 695.34]  My theory.
[695.62 --> 702.28]  And maybe it's just the kind of thing that I tell myself when I crawl into my bed and pull my covers up.
[702.52 --> 706.62]  And get into a fetal position every night and go, oh my god, the world.
[706.62 --> 709.20]  I have a theory.
[709.98 --> 711.50]  We've been doing a lot of that lately.
[711.62 --> 713.76]  When nothing online is real.
[714.46 --> 720.44]  The players I'm playing against who are realistically, in many cases, aimbotting.
[720.60 --> 721.10]  I like this.
[721.18 --> 721.44]  Okay.
[721.44 --> 727.00]  Or the news stories that I'm seeing in my social media feed.
[727.50 --> 734.96]  Or the questions and answers that I'm looking at on Reddit.
[735.08 --> 741.98]  Remember we talked about that undisclosed study that that educational institute did.
[742.08 --> 745.32]  Where they were just like having bots interact on r slash change my mind.
[745.32 --> 749.50]  When nothing is real, we're all going to go, you know what?
[750.28 --> 751.02]  Fuck it.
[751.52 --> 752.48]  And get offline.
[754.14 --> 758.34]  We're going to just like, we're going to play video games in person.
[759.08 --> 761.48]  We're going to demand LAN play.
[761.86 --> 771.26]  And if gaming companies won't put LAN functionality into their games, then we'll be like, alright, I'm going to play CS 1.6.
[771.26 --> 783.66]  I don't remember where I read this, but I have read that apparently there's been an increase in like more provably bespoke products being demanded by consumers.
[784.22 --> 784.78]  Yeah.
[785.12 --> 789.54]  Because there's the whole like, oh, it's an Etsy shop and they make it themselves for sure.
[789.66 --> 789.86]  Yeah.
[789.94 --> 790.94]  It's actually just from Alibaba.
[791.06 --> 791.18]  Yeah.
[791.36 --> 794.16]  That's such another perfect example of like everything.
[794.16 --> 794.70]  It's all fake.
[795.04 --> 797.84]  Everything just being mass produced slop.
[797.84 --> 804.42]  So there's been an increase in like, I want to buy this product and I want a video of you making it.
[805.60 --> 806.94]  Like that type of stuff.
[807.00 --> 807.96]  Oh, well, that's...
[807.96 --> 808.68]  Like, yeah.
[809.90 --> 812.08]  Make a video of me making this product.
[813.96 --> 814.76]  But...
[814.76 --> 818.96]  If it's custom, it's going to be a little bit harder to match the physical product that shows up.
[818.98 --> 819.00]  It will.
[819.36 --> 819.58]  Yeah.
[819.72 --> 820.20]  It will.
[820.36 --> 821.46]  Like actually a lot harder.
[821.58 --> 822.00]  It will.
[822.00 --> 824.00]  Dude, I...
[824.00 --> 826.00]  Maybe...
[826.58 --> 827.36]  Oh, okay.
[827.84 --> 834.36]  But like, there's no point being for or against AI progress.
[834.92 --> 835.88]  Because it just...
[835.88 --> 837.06]  It's going to happen.
[837.38 --> 843.02]  The horse bolted from the pen at this point ages ago.
[843.08 --> 846.52]  Anyone still having the conversation of like, should we do this or not is just behind.
[846.74 --> 846.94]  Yeah.
[847.62 --> 848.22]  So...
[848.22 --> 848.84]  Unfortunately.
[850.12 --> 853.52]  So realistically, it doesn't matter what the next thing I say is.
[853.52 --> 857.00]  If I say I'm for it or against it, it is irrelevant.
[857.00 --> 857.26]  Right?
[857.26 --> 857.44]  Yep.
[857.44 --> 862.06]  But maybe that's the one comforting thought that could make me go, okay.
[862.66 --> 862.98]  Okay.
[864.08 --> 868.34]  Maybe that's the positive outcome that might come from this.
[868.34 --> 886.14]  But then the thing that made me hesitate to even say that is like, even with how bad, even with how bad AI replications have been, and with how identifiable scams have been for many years, the video's not up yet.
[886.14 --> 887.14]  It should be coming very soon.
[887.14 --> 887.60]  It should be coming very soon.
[887.60 --> 889.20]  That collab we did with Kit Boga.
[889.58 --> 889.76]  Yeah.
[889.96 --> 890.16]  Right?
[890.16 --> 904.40]  If people are still being fooled by Nigerian Prince emails effectively, it's going to be so long before my hopeful outcome could ever possibly happen.
[904.40 --> 915.60]  Before this information about misinformation and disinformation propagates enough that we all just go, you know what, basically, I just don't believe anything.
[915.98 --> 916.46]  Forget it.
[916.58 --> 920.20]  And you can help arm some people, but it'll never work for everybody.
[920.20 --> 937.96]  I mean, there's the problem of like, some of those Nigerian Prince scams, they include things like weird typos and things that could tip you off on purpose, because they're trying to weed out people that are actually paying attention.
[939.54 --> 941.72]  I did not ever think about that.
[941.72 --> 942.98]  Yeah, that's like a thing, apparently.
[942.98 --> 950.52]  But I wonder if that bar gets higher, the easier it is to be more and more convincing all the time.
[951.16 --> 951.90]  I think so.
[952.12 --> 952.92]  I feel like it would.
[952.92 --> 953.10]  Yeah.
[953.24 --> 953.34]  No.
[953.40 --> 954.24]  Oh, 100%.
[954.24 --> 954.46]  No.
[954.56 --> 957.26]  I think more people are going to get scammed.
[957.38 --> 964.70]  I mean, now that you could just generate, you know, a photorealistic Linus that will show you his tech tip and ask you to respond.
[964.70 --> 976.70]  Like, I actually saw someone on the subreddit that was saying that a scammer used my name and was apparently giving away MacBooks, which should have been your first clue.
[978.00 --> 979.40]  Why would anyone want that?
[979.96 --> 980.60]  I would know better.
[980.78 --> 981.34]  I'm kidding.
[981.76 --> 982.26]  I'm kidding.
[982.76 --> 983.42]  Andy, relax.
[984.00 --> 984.50]  It's okay.
[985.26 --> 986.66]  I think he's on a MacBook now.
[986.90 --> 987.60]  Then I gave it.
[987.90 --> 988.54]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[988.88 --> 993.00]  Yeah, I think most of the editors, Andy, were most of the editors this trip on MacBooks?
[993.00 --> 1003.00]  Yeah, we have found that the Adobe suite is actually more stable on Mac, which matters more when we're on mobile hardware.
[1003.72 --> 1004.46]  We're so cooked.
[1005.80 --> 1007.00]  Not great.
[1007.66 --> 1007.84]  Yeah.
[1008.06 --> 1008.94]  Not awesome.
[1009.08 --> 1022.62]  Look, I'm, contrary to the narratives that are constructed, I am not for or against anything other than whatever its utility is to me
[1022.62 --> 1026.08]  or someone else and the price, you know?
[1026.48 --> 1028.64]  And also the intangibles.
[1029.06 --> 1034.70]  Or actually, I was going to, well, I was going to call it repairability and intangible, but repairing things is actually quite tangible.
[1035.12 --> 1038.08]  So, the other, you know, the other X factors.
[1038.08 --> 1044.20]  And if a MacBook is the best tool for the job, then gosh darn it, we're going to use a MacBook for it.
[1044.26 --> 1044.70]  I don't care.
[1045.10 --> 1045.64]  Yeah, nice.
[1046.44 --> 1047.02]  I do agree.
[1048.58 --> 1053.52]  Dude, I was using my MacBook from the MacBook Challenge so far past the 30 days.
[1053.52 --> 1060.30]  Because other than the desktop experience, which I was quite unhappy with, it's a great computer.
[1060.72 --> 1064.68]  So, I got, this is a new work laptop.
[1065.34 --> 1067.76]  My last work laptop was like four or five years old.
[1067.94 --> 1070.16]  It couldn't do broadcast anymore, etc.
[1070.16 --> 1080.00]  You don't need to excuse that you allocated yourself budget for a brand new machine when you had a perfectly working machine.
[1081.86 --> 1087.74]  When it first showed up, there was a huge pixel issue with the screen.
[1088.30 --> 1093.26]  So, we used the old Lenovo warranty thing and the dude showed up and like swapped the screen.
[1093.34 --> 1093.58]  Really?
[1093.72 --> 1094.58]  I mean, that's kind of cool.
[1095.44 --> 1100.24]  There was multiple delays, cough, cough, but it wasn't debilitating so it wasn't that big of a deal.
[1100.72 --> 1105.02]  Now, and it hasn't happened yet, this show, which is great, but last show we experienced it.
[1105.60 --> 1107.66]  The screen will just completely lock.
[1107.74 --> 1109.20]  The computer still functions behind.
[1109.44 --> 1110.84]  Like, I can still click on things even.
[1111.18 --> 1115.04]  But the screen will completely lock and the only way to fix it is to sleep the computer and wake it back up again.
[1115.68 --> 1119.06]  And I, one of the guys from Hardware Canucks, I was talking to him.
[1119.16 --> 1121.30]  He has the same laptop and he has the same issue.
[1122.62 --> 1122.98]  Why?
[1122.98 --> 1127.48]  And that, my friends, is why our laptop partner for the WAN show is Dell.
[1129.42 --> 1134.64]  Those Dell machines on the WAN show set have actually been like rock solid.
[1134.90 --> 1135.18]  They have.
[1135.26 --> 1136.46]  You might even say heart touching.
[1136.58 --> 1137.78]  Wait, no, no, wrong, bad.
[1137.84 --> 1138.02]  Wrong.
[1138.16 --> 1142.00]  Okay, so wait, how, okay.
[1142.94 --> 1146.20]  I don't know how we got to where we are now from 8GB cards.
[1148.40 --> 1148.72]  Counterstrike.
[1148.74 --> 1149.12]  Oh, right.
[1149.16 --> 1149.70]  Don't worry about it.
[1149.70 --> 1150.16]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1150.16 --> 1152.28]  Let's talk about GPUs at Computex.
[1152.32 --> 1152.50]  Yeah.
[1152.70 --> 1157.96]  Intel announced the Arc Pro B60 and B50 workstation cards.
[1158.16 --> 1164.90]  They're using their Xe2 Battle Mage architecture with, wow, thank you whoever prepared these notes today.
[1164.90 --> 1170.28]  Xe vector engines and Xe matrix extensions engines.
[1170.28 --> 1171.06]  Okay.
[1171.06 --> 1173.80]  None of that is the important thing about Arc Pro.
[1174.14 --> 1181.92]  The important thing about Arc Pro is that we are talking about cards with certified drivers for just a few hundred dollars.
[1181.92 --> 1187.40]  B50 is not going to be lighting anyone's world on fire in terms of its groundbreaking performance.
[1187.40 --> 1200.16]  But what it does have is certified flipping drivers so that when you're building out, you know, an architectural firm's office and everyone in their flipping dog needs a professional GPU.
[1200.16 --> 1206.50]  You can take your little, you know, slimline, you know, OptiPlex stations or whatever.
[1206.50 --> 1208.66]  You can slap these babies in there.
[1208.98 --> 1216.06]  They are, I believe they max out at 70 watts, which means that they can work without a PCIe power cable.
[1216.06 --> 1218.78]  They are dual width, half height.
[1218.92 --> 1221.20]  They come with both the half height and full height bracket.
[1221.20 --> 1226.64]  So you can throw these things into basically any desktop chassis and boom.
[1226.98 --> 1239.00]  And I was actually, I got to admit, when Intel put up the slides about compared to last gen, I was like, y'all had an Alchemist Pro GPU?
[1239.84 --> 1240.14]  Yeah.
[1241.28 --> 1242.48]  Totally missed that.
[1243.60 --> 1245.16]  Did anyone care about that?
[1245.16 --> 1245.54]  Wait, did they actually?
[1245.54 --> 1246.02]  Yeah.
[1246.34 --> 1246.82]  Oh, wow.
[1246.88 --> 1247.46]  I had no idea.
[1247.56 --> 1248.76]  Yeah, no, I had no idea.
[1249.52 --> 1262.02]  And so I was quite surprised because the slide that had all of the companies that they had certified their drivers with was like impressive.
[1262.28 --> 1270.92]  I was like, yo, SolidWorks, Autodesk, Blender, like, y'all got like really like the big names here.
[1271.14 --> 1274.96]  That's really good for a first gen product that hasn't even launched yet.
[1274.96 --> 1282.76]  But just like on the gaming side, Intel's software side for ARK has been cooking.
[1282.76 --> 1296.68]  Like the amount of performance they squeezed out of what I think now that BattleMage is out, Intel would probably even admit was a fundamentally flawed architecture in Alchemist.
[1296.68 --> 1312.24]  Like they had issues with the internal caching or something that was the reason that like you absolutely needed resizable bar or it basically went to crap town in a hurry in terms of performance.
[1312.24 --> 1314.40]  I forget what the exact technical reason was.
[1314.40 --> 1319.04]  But like there were hardware reasons that Alchemist was not very good.
[1320.04 --> 1322.00]  Boy, did they ever squeeze a lot of it.
[1322.00 --> 1332.18]  And that gives me so much confidence in their commit level because you can release a GPU relatively easily.
[1332.18 --> 1339.68]  And I say this as a lay person who could not possibly hope to design and release a GPU.
[1339.68 --> 1343.48]  I say this as like compared to a CPU.
[1344.00 --> 1348.52]  GPUs are relatively, relatively simple.
[1350.16 --> 1351.80]  But it's the software.
[1352.44 --> 1354.74]  The software will kill you.
[1355.18 --> 1359.08]  That's the challenge that Intel knew that they were coming up against.
[1359.20 --> 1361.08]  It wasn't can we build a parallel processor.
[1361.08 --> 1366.14]  The rate at which you need to release stable drivers, right?
[1366.22 --> 1367.90]  Because of all these new games coming out and stuff.
[1368.04 --> 1368.74]  Like, damn.
[1369.34 --> 1370.46]  Here's a question for you.
[1370.56 --> 1370.74]  Yeah.
[1371.44 --> 1379.12]  Do you think ARK can survive and thrive and continue forward if TAP retires?
[1380.14 --> 1381.30]  Let's get to that in a second.
[1381.46 --> 1383.34]  First, let's talk about the B60.
[1383.52 --> 1385.64]  This is a more performant card.
[1385.76 --> 1389.78]  This one, instead of being 70 watts, I believe it's a couple hundred watts.
[1389.78 --> 1391.26]  Don't quote me on that, though.
[1391.32 --> 1392.38]  The watts are not in here.
[1392.68 --> 1393.12]  It doesn't matter.
[1393.20 --> 1401.38]  The point is, this is meant to be more like a cheap and cheerful 24 gig AI capable card
[1401.38 --> 1404.80]  that you can have in a slightly higher end workstation.
[1405.34 --> 1409.72]  Slash, they have this concept that they were showing off called Battle Matrix.
[1410.44 --> 1413.14]  And they're doing some, again, down to the software.
[1413.52 --> 1417.82]  They're doing some software tomfoolery that's supposed to make it much easier
[1417.82 --> 1422.44]  to take a whole pool of these cards, up to eight of them, combine the memory,
[1422.66 --> 1427.26]  split up your AI workloads so you can chunk it out and chew on the whole thing in parallel.
[1427.82 --> 1428.78]  And you know what?
[1428.96 --> 1432.30]  Is the performance going to be as good as an NVIDIA solution?
[1433.72 --> 1434.48]  Be real.
[1434.84 --> 1435.12]  No.
[1435.54 --> 1435.84]  Right?
[1436.32 --> 1437.02]  But the price.
[1437.02 --> 1437.62]  That'd be a lot cheaper.
[1437.62 --> 1438.80]  But the price.
[1439.24 --> 1439.76]  Literally.
[1440.18 --> 1444.82]  We are talking about if Intel gets their way, and this comes to market at the pricing that
[1444.82 --> 1445.32]  they're targeting.
[1445.62 --> 1452.32]  We are talking about like a full fat rack mount solution with 192 gigs of usable VRAM.
[1452.76 --> 1458.06]  Plus, you can stack it up with system memory that you can overflow into.
[1458.34 --> 1461.52]  We're talking about starting at anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000.
[1461.52 --> 1467.64]  And they're not giving pricing for B60 Pro, but what they are saying is that that $5,000
[1467.64 --> 1473.52]  to $10,000 is for the whole chassis with anywhere from one to eight GPUs.
[1473.78 --> 1476.42]  So it's like, okay, I think I can do the math.
[1476.80 --> 1483.70]  And, and, on the record, but, you know, don't quote me on this, right?
[1483.86 --> 1484.06]  Sure.
[1484.42 --> 1484.62]  Yeah.
[1484.62 --> 1490.68]  They're saying that they think they can do even better than the $700 or so per GPU that
[1490.68 --> 1493.72]  that would, that $5,000 to $10,000 mark works out to.
[1494.12 --> 1497.24]  Like, given time, I mean, the hardware, right?
[1497.86 --> 1501.20]  The hardware is literally just an ARC B580.
[1501.26 --> 1501.48]  Yeah.
[1501.88 --> 1505.44]  For the, for the B60 Pro, or for the Pro B60, excuse me.
[1505.78 --> 1511.06]  So, yeah, nothing should prevent them from doing this for, you know, 500 bucks or whatever.
[1511.06 --> 1516.66]  And if the goal is to get an install base out there, which is an assignment that Intel seems
[1516.66 --> 1522.88]  to somewhat understand at this point, then that's exactly what you need to do.
[1522.96 --> 1528.40]  You make this investment upfront in the software ecosystem for developers, and then you make
[1528.40 --> 1530.20]  the hardware accessible.
[1531.06 --> 1538.44]  If I can get, like, a whole ass server platform for, realistically, not that different a price
[1538.44 --> 1539.62]  from, like, a Mac studio?
[1542.46 --> 1548.38]  And, like, that, that is a, you know, a decently substantial group of people, because there's
[1548.38 --> 1557.16]  a lot of, like, small to medium-sized businesses that want local, like, LLMs, inline IDE assistance,
[1557.16 --> 1561.30]  stuff like that, that are building these solutions.
[1561.30 --> 1565.74]  And if you could just do it with ARC cards, like, why not?
[1566.36 --> 1566.64]  Dude.
[1567.34 --> 1578.42]  Speaking of ARC cards and pricing, I had a intense conversation with a very, very, very old,
[1578.42 --> 1583.34]  old acquaintance of mine, Vivian, who is running the discrete GPU.
[1583.34 --> 1594.14]  She's a VP and GM, so basically running discrete GPU for Intel ARC, where I have to confess, Vivian,
[1594.14 --> 1597.46]  if you're watching this, I know you don't watch my own show, that's totally fine, but if you're
[1597.46 --> 1601.10]  watching this, which you're not, I'm sorry I was a little cranky.
[1602.36 --> 1606.78]  I got a little bit set off by one of the slides that Intel had in their deck.
[1606.78 --> 1613.74]  Like, the whole, the whole thing was about ARC Pro, and, you know, I, I, so I, I, I didn't
[1613.74 --> 1620.40]  make the video about this or anything like that, but their ARC Pro deck had one slide right
[1620.40 --> 1624.74]  at the beginning, okay, that was like, ARC Battle Mage.
[1624.74 --> 1626.46]  So it was about the non-pro, right?
[1626.76 --> 1631.70]  ARC Battle Mage, leading performance per dollar, and, you know, basically was kind of setting
[1631.70 --> 1638.26]  the stage for, let's go non-gamers, we got, we're gonna have great performance per dollar,
[1638.26 --> 1647.08]  just like we do with our gaming cards, um, and it was like, best performance per dollar, asterisk.
[1649.44 --> 1656.72]  Best value for GPUs under $300, which is one hell of an asterisk.
[1656.84 --> 1657.74]  Yeah, that's, uh.
[1657.74 --> 1667.02]  Asterisk two, as of November 2024, because, yeah, okay, so, so that was my face.
[1667.32 --> 1667.80]  That's rough.
[1667.92 --> 1672.02]  The November 2024, I suspect, is probably just because that's when they ran the numbers.
[1672.32 --> 1675.86]  And they're not gonna rerun those numbers for one slide in an ARC Pro presentation.
[1676.48 --> 1678.60]  So, I'll let that one.
[1678.60 --> 1680.76]  That's a fairly convenient time to have ran the numbers.
[1680.94 --> 1681.90]  I'll let that one pass.
[1682.06 --> 1683.06]  I'll let that one pass.
[1683.64 --> 1684.28]  But the one that I.
[1684.28 --> 1685.92]  It's also been a long time since then.
[1685.92 --> 1691.78]  The one that I was really upset about was that it said under $300 US dollars.
[1692.78 --> 1697.92]  And when I basically was like, hey, so look, I don't want to be that guy, but it's literally
[1697.92 --> 1705.16]  my job to press GPU companies on the fact that GPUs cannot be purchased at MSRP.
[1705.16 --> 1714.06]  I don't like you guys showing this slide when I can't buy an ARC B580 for under $300.
[1714.76 --> 1714.92]  Yeah.
[1715.08 --> 1717.20]  This card shouldn't be able to be on the slide that it's.
[1717.20 --> 1722.16]  That's when the conversation got a little bit intense.
[1722.38 --> 1732.74]  And that's at least 93% my fault because I was just, we got off on the wrong foot a little
[1732.74 --> 1732.96]  bit.
[1733.12 --> 1734.28]  I really didn't like that.
[1734.28 --> 1739.56]  And then the response was not great.
[1739.80 --> 1744.40]  I'm not going to name who said this part because it was, it was whole group setting.
[1744.50 --> 1746.40]  There was like a dozen Intel people in the room.
[1746.96 --> 1749.22]  So someone was like, yes, you can.
[1749.44 --> 1752.52]  And I was like, okay, show me.
[1752.52 --> 1755.94]  And they pulled up like minefactory.de or something.
[1756.52 --> 1757.74]  And I'm like, right.
[1759.68 --> 1762.92]  That's where I got a little, I got a little more frustrated.
[1763.26 --> 1765.64]  Your slide says US dollars.
[1766.48 --> 1773.84]  You don't get to convert euros to US dollars and tell me I can buy an ARC B580 for under
[1773.84 --> 1775.02]  $300 US dollars.
[1775.16 --> 1777.70]  That, sir, is actually bullshit.
[1777.90 --> 1778.36]  That's whack.
[1778.44 --> 1779.52]  You're not allowed to do that.
[1779.52 --> 1779.88]  Yeah.
[1780.68 --> 1787.52]  And so what I basically said to them is, look, what I need is I don't need you to fix it
[1787.52 --> 1787.90]  right now.
[1788.12 --> 1792.64]  I don't need you to call up Newegg who is in the middle of the night now and tell them
[1792.64 --> 1794.42]  to fix their pricing.
[1794.80 --> 1803.10]  But what I need is a coherent strategy that Intel will be employing to ensure that ARC B580s
[1803.10 --> 1806.84]  will be available at MSRP in the US, in US dollars.
[1806.84 --> 1815.34]  And then I got more intense because basically, and I'm not going to name sort of names, but
[1815.34 --> 1820.14]  people started to kind of pipe up and go, well, you know, we can't control what our board
[1820.14 --> 1824.08]  partners do in terms of pricing and what retailers do in terms of pricing.
[1824.08 --> 1832.98]  And I basically was like, I'm going to let you finish, but I worked in the channel.
[1833.88 --> 1835.92]  Do not tell me that.
[1836.48 --> 1837.94]  You absolutely have levers.
[1838.32 --> 1839.48]  You absolutely do.
[1840.54 --> 1844.64]  Whether or not you choose to pull them, that is your choice.
[1845.02 --> 1846.36]  But you have levers.
[1846.36 --> 1848.78]  You have levers in terms of production.
[1848.78 --> 1850.24]  If Arizona iced tea can do it.
[1850.62 --> 1852.18]  You have levers in terms of production.
[1852.64 --> 1856.18]  You have levers in terms of allocation of parts.
[1856.58 --> 1862.14]  You have levers in terms of the marketing funding that you provide to your partners, both
[1862.14 --> 1864.98]  manufacturing partners and retail partners.
[1865.32 --> 1870.50]  You have levers in terms of the fact that you have a founder's edition.
[1870.50 --> 1876.54]  You have your limited edition cards that have an Intel label on them that you could literally
[1876.54 --> 1883.74]  control the pricing on that only exist so that you can put pressure on other board partners
[1883.74 --> 1885.76]  to fall in line in terms of pricing.
[1885.94 --> 1889.00]  Everybody knows that's why founder's edition exists, right?
[1891.32 --> 1894.80]  I just listed, and that's not even all of the levers.
[1895.22 --> 1899.88]  I listed many levers that you have to manage channel pricing.
[1899.88 --> 1906.42]  It's not legal in every market, but there is actually, okay, that typically goes the other
[1906.42 --> 1910.84]  way, but there's things like map pricing where you have a minimum advertised price.
[1911.54 --> 1914.50]  That can be considered price fixing depending on the market.
[1914.62 --> 1921.00]  I'm just saying illegal or not, many brands attempt to do it.
[1921.72 --> 1922.60]  So there are levers.
[1922.76 --> 1923.72]  There are levers to pull.
[1924.40 --> 1929.60]  And after things got a little intense for a little bit, I got a firm commitment.
[1929.88 --> 1936.64]  That Intel would come to me with a strategy where they were going to get pricing to MSRP.
[1937.02 --> 1940.12]  And I didn't even ask for like $249.99.
[1940.84 --> 1943.02]  I was like, look, I get it.
[1943.28 --> 1945.20]  This one has three fans on it.
[1945.58 --> 1947.36]  It's $269.99.
[1947.36 --> 1948.48]  Okay.
[1948.48 --> 1948.54]  Okay.
[1948.54 --> 1948.88]  Okay.
[1948.88 --> 1950.54]  This is an OC.
[1950.54 --> 1951.44]  Sure.
[1951.44 --> 1951.94]  Whatever.
[1951.94 --> 1953.62]  Product variance, whatever.
[1953.62 --> 1954.20]  That's fine.
[1954.20 --> 1954.50]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1954.50 --> 1955.08]  That's fine.
[1955.08 --> 1962.36]  There's more than a decade of precedent for, hey, this one is a little more, this is one's
[1962.36 --> 1964.58]  a little more fixy fixy.
[1964.58 --> 1970.04]  Um, you know, we, we did some extra special stuff with the VRMs.
[1970.72 --> 1971.98]  No problem with that.
[1972.38 --> 1977.56]  Um, but if you're going to say, and this is, this is where the sticking point is.
[1977.68 --> 1983.40]  If you're going to say this GPU costs this much, and you're going to ask me to say this
[1983.40 --> 1986.58]  GPU costs this much, don't make me a liar.
[1986.88 --> 1987.10]  Yeah.
[1987.52 --> 1988.64]  I don't like that.
[1989.22 --> 1990.14]  Now, hold on a second.
[1990.74 --> 1994.24]  CallMeKana says, isn't this a slippery slope?
[1994.60 --> 1998.34]  Isn't this level of control the same thing you criticize NVIDIA for?
[1999.34 --> 2003.34]  What I criticize NVIDIA for is multifaceted.
[2003.50 --> 2009.84]  And I guess that actually transitions us perfectly into our next topic, which is RTX 5060.
[2009.84 --> 2017.44]  And in general, NVIDIA's current kerfuffle with the media very, very broadly.
[2018.10 --> 2025.96]  Um, NVIDIA's level of control is unlike almost any other company in the industry.
[2026.12 --> 2033.18]  I would say maybe, not maybe, Apple and NVIDIA are the two kind of birds of a feather that
[2033.18 --> 2038.40]  I point to when I look at the level of control that they maintain over their product, their,
[2038.40 --> 2045.78]  their image and branding, their partners, um, the media, they, they both exercise it in
[2045.78 --> 2048.82]  their own special, unique ways.
[2049.04 --> 2054.60]  I mean, um, I remember that video that Marquez and who's the, Mr. Who's the Boss did like
[2054.60 --> 2059.78]  ages ago, talking about the way that companies can control narrative, control the narrative
[2059.78 --> 2060.68]  through access.
[2060.68 --> 2065.68]  Uh, neither of them named Apple, uh, which I thought was curious at the time.
[2065.68 --> 2067.68]  Um, I was kind of sitting there going,
[2068.94 --> 2073.96]  Hmm, companies that, uh, that refuse to work with you.
[2073.96 --> 2080.82]  If you, you know, you can criticize the product, but you know, if you talk about them the wrong
[2080.82 --> 2082.22]  way, they refuse to work with you.
[2082.26 --> 2086.28]  We don't mention them in our video about companies that do that, but I, I get it.
[2086.28 --> 2086.70]  I get it.
[2086.70 --> 2089.06]  Um, uh, yeah.
[2089.14 --> 2095.90]  So Apple, um, is a great example of you've got to kind of play the game and they don't
[2095.90 --> 2097.08]  tell you what the rules are.
[2097.16 --> 2101.64]  So you just have to err on the side of, you know, not saying the wrong things to make sure
[2101.64 --> 2103.60]  that you, you know, stay on the list.
[2103.60 --> 2103.94]  Right.
[2104.00 --> 2104.22]  Yeah.
[2104.56 --> 2110.68]  Um, Nvidia doesn't, Nvidia doesn't do things that way.
[2110.68 --> 2116.02]  Uh, Nvidia for the most part actually takes criticism.
[2116.36 --> 2119.86]  We've criticized Nvidia a lot over the years.
[2120.08 --> 2123.66]  Uh, they have generally been okay about taking criticism from the media.
[2123.90 --> 2130.18]  And I suspect the reason for it is it used to be that in general, they saw the benefit
[2130.18 --> 2133.42]  of working with media and understood that they had to take their lumps.
[2134.02 --> 2136.46]  Um, and then now I think it's cause they just kind of don't care.
[2136.80 --> 2138.44]  I think it's cause it's just sort of irrelevant.
[2138.44 --> 2142.80]  So the reason has changed, but in general, they, they've taken criticism from the media.
[2143.22 --> 2143.30]  Yeah.
[2143.30 --> 2149.26]  They seem to take criticism, but they, they can be pushy about the message that they
[2149.26 --> 2149.50]  want.
[2149.76 --> 2150.64]  Oh, they can be extremely.
[2150.64 --> 2152.54]  They don't care if you like go after them.
[2152.92 --> 2157.56]  They can be, they can be pushy and they can be petty and they can be vindictive.
[2157.66 --> 2157.92]  Yes.
[2158.10 --> 2158.68]  Oh, yeah.
[2158.90 --> 2159.78]  Big on that last one.
[2159.78 --> 2160.92]  Big on that last one.
[2161.14 --> 2165.88]  And, and I've talked in the past about how I do think that it is a fundamental cultural
[2165.88 --> 2167.38]  issue at the company.
[2167.38 --> 2167.68]  Yeah.
[2167.68 --> 2169.36]  I think it comes from the top down.
[2169.80 --> 2179.62]  Um, but in general, they have, they have mostly, mostly sort of, you know, tried to work with
[2179.62 --> 2184.40]  the media, but they also have their own issues.
[2184.40 --> 2186.02]  And it goes way back.
[2186.08 --> 2187.74]  Was it the 10 80 launch?
[2187.74 --> 2194.34]  The one where you guys were stuck in a room with no internet while Nvidia basically did
[2194.34 --> 2199.30]  the entire announcement that prior to that, you know, they would have briefed the press
[2199.30 --> 2200.52]  and the press would have done it.
[2200.76 --> 2206.50]  And they, they've slowly taken over the role of, of spreading the news about Nvidia that
[2206.50 --> 2209.18]  the media used to have and made it Nvidia's job.
[2209.18 --> 2212.50]  I don't remember the exact details, but if I remember correctly, they didn't tell us stuff
[2212.50 --> 2218.54]  like the price and a few other like really key things that if you published an announcement
[2218.54 --> 2220.58]  video, you would really expect to have.
[2220.58 --> 2222.54]  And they kept those for the keynote.
[2222.54 --> 2227.16]  And then the keynote was like really long and we couldn't really leave during it.
[2227.16 --> 2231.44]  And then after the keynote, we were stuck in this weird location where like nobody had
[2231.44 --> 2233.54]  internet and there was no appropriate places to film.
[2233.88 --> 2240.40]  And there was a dead mouse concert super loud in a relatively small building so that you
[2240.40 --> 2241.84]  could still hear it when you're outside.
[2241.84 --> 2247.20]  So you couldn't actually record because you just get, I mean, I'm not saying that dead mouse
[2247.20 --> 2251.14]  himself would necessarily do this just to be clear, but like, I'm assuming he's under some
[2251.14 --> 2255.18]  form of label that might try to copy strike your video or whatever.
[2255.18 --> 2260.96]  So like it was a very complicated situation and it was very intentional.
[2263.12 --> 2263.76]  Yeah.
[2264.18 --> 2271.14]  So, so, so Nvidia's, Nvidia's control, I guess what I'm saying is it's weird.
[2271.84 --> 2273.52]  Um, and it changes, right?
[2273.52 --> 2277.84]  That's the thing that I think a lot of people miss when we're, when we talk about a company
[2277.84 --> 2284.16]  is moves that Nvidia pulled 10 years ago, um, are not, were not executed by the same people
[2284.16 --> 2286.84]  that are, you know, pulling moves today.
[2286.84 --> 2291.02]  Um, so, you know, back to, back to managing pricing.
[2291.02 --> 2292.02]  Yes.
[2292.02 --> 2301.02]  Yes, Nvidia absolutely put undue pressure on their board partners to meet MSRP targets that were
[2301.02 --> 2303.02]  not sustainable for their businesses.
[2303.02 --> 2304.02]  Yeah.
[2304.02 --> 2305.02]  It's a different problem.
[2305.02 --> 2312.02]  We saw a large number of Nvidia board partners disappear over the last 10, 15 years.
[2312.02 --> 2320.02]  However, however, I don't have a reason to believe just yet that Intel is doing the other problematic
[2320.02 --> 2325.02]  part of that, that Nvidia was doing where they are not providing their board partners with adequate
[2325.02 --> 2327.26]  margin for survival.
[2327.26 --> 2334.02]  That was the issue was that Nvidia was forcing this artificially low price while slowly, slowly,
[2334.02 --> 2339.28]  slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly chipping away the margin that they were leaving for their
[2339.28 --> 2342.02]  board partners in that target price.
[2342.02 --> 2347.02]  I think this type of stuff, including a lot of other things is why EVGA ended up bailing.
[2347.02 --> 2355.02]  Nvidia also put extremely restrictive, I was going to say the word guidelines, but they're
[2355.02 --> 2359.02]  less guidelines and more pirate law.
[2359.02 --> 2364.02]  Um, they put extremely restrictive guidelines in place for their board partners in terms of
[2364.02 --> 2369.02]  the types of products they could build in order to differentiate their own brand.
[2369.02 --> 2375.02]  Like, hmm, project, uh, or, uh, sorry, GeForce Partner Program.
[2375.02 --> 2379.02]  GeForce Partner Program, which was called out many years ago by Kyle from HardOCP.
[2379.02 --> 2383.02]  Uh, he was the one who ended up, I think he's probably been blackballed by Nvidia more times
[2383.02 --> 2386.02]  than the current crop of YouTubers combined.
[2386.02 --> 2387.02]  Yeah.
[2387.02 --> 2394.02]  Um, Kyle from HardOCP did a really great job of investigating the GeForce Partner Program,
[2394.02 --> 2400.34]  which was this extremely restrictive, uh, system that Nvidia put in place for their partners
[2400.34 --> 2404.52]  that controlled everything from what kinds of products they could build to what they could
[2404.52 --> 2407.74]  clock them at to how they could package them and message them.
[2407.74 --> 2414.64]  So if you've noticed over the last 10 years that GeForce boards have gotten more and more
[2414.64 --> 2417.64]  samey and boring, even down to the package.
[2417.64 --> 2418.64]  Extremely so.
[2418.64 --> 2421.64]  You ever notice the packages all look the same now?
[2421.64 --> 2422.64]  Even this one.
[2422.64 --> 2423.64]  Yeah, of course.
[2423.64 --> 2427.64]  It's got, it has all the, all the requirements.
[2427.64 --> 2431.64]  Um, like, that, that.
[2431.64 --> 2433.64]  And they used to be so fun.
[2433.64 --> 2434.64]  That's what Nvidia does.
[2434.64 --> 2437.64]  Uh, oh, we have a topic about that too, actually.
[2437.64 --> 2438.64]  Oh, okay.
[2438.64 --> 2440.64]  He hasn't read the whole doc yet, but that one's going to be pretty fun.
[2440.64 --> 2443.64]  So, so yes, yes.
[2443.64 --> 2447.64]  Um, putting pressure on your partners.
[2447.64 --> 2448.64]  Okay.
[2448.64 --> 2451.64]  To, you know, maintain pricing in the channel or whatever.
[2451.64 --> 2459.64]  Yes, that is something that I have criticized Nvidia for, but it's part of the broader Nvidia
[2459.64 --> 2465.64]  behavior that puts their partners in a position of constant fear.
[2465.64 --> 2473.64]  Um, you know, you, you talk to, you talk to an Nvidia partner off the record and you kind of go, okay, well like, yeah.
[2473.64 --> 2482.64]  Why don't you just, why don't you just take some of those GPUs that you've got and put them on like a cool, uh, small form factor card.
[2482.64 --> 2487.64]  And we're like, oh, cause dad wouldn't like that.
[2487.64 --> 2488.64]  We're afraid.
[2488.64 --> 2489.64]  Yeah.
[2489.64 --> 2490.64]  Yeah.
[2490.64 --> 2491.64]  Dad will never give me another GPU again.
[2491.64 --> 2495.64]  Dad will take my allocation of GPUs, which I do still make money on.
[2495.64 --> 2503.64]  And I need to make money on because I spent all this development cost building these approved, dad approved products.
[2503.64 --> 2508.64]  Um, it'll just take my allocation for that quarter and give it to my biggest competitor.
[2508.64 --> 2521.64]  And I don't know for a fact, allegedly, allegedly, I don't know for a fact that they would do that, but I've, I've, I've heard this fear consistently enough from enough of dad's children.
[2521.64 --> 2522.64]  Oh yeah.
[2522.64 --> 2525.64]  That, uh, I think I kinda, I think I kind of believe it.
[2525.64 --> 2526.64]  Yeah.
[2529.64 --> 2530.64]  So that's.
[2530.64 --> 2532.64]  That thing happened by the way.
[2532.64 --> 2533.64]  Oh, nice.
[2533.64 --> 2540.64]  So screen is completely locked and I have to sleep it and then wake it up again and it'll work fine.
[2540.64 --> 2550.64]  So if you've ever wondered what, what happened, do you remember those really cool little ASRock mini desktops that used MXM laptop GPUs?
[2550.64 --> 2552.64]  You ever wonder what happened to those?
[2552.64 --> 2562.64]  You ever, you ever, you ever wonder why there was never, you know, um, updated, uh, mobile GPU things for a particular generation of laptops?
[2562.64 --> 2566.64]  You ever wonder why framework has only Radeon as options?
[2566.64 --> 2568.64]  You ever wonder any of these things?
[2569.64 --> 2575.64]  It's because allegedly Nvidia's partners are terrified.
[2575.64 --> 2579.64]  I got petrified would be the right word because they won't act.
[2579.64 --> 2580.64]  Yeah.
[2580.64 --> 2588.64]  They are, they are petrified of running a foul of Nvidia by producing a product that Nvidia hasn't signed off on.
[2588.64 --> 2593.64]  And I got to tell you some of the off the record conversations I've had.
[2593.64 --> 2595.64]  So I can't repeat these because they would be too identifiable.
[2595.64 --> 2596.64]  Right.
[2596.64 --> 2603.64]  Some of the off the record conversations that I've had about Nvidia's logic for why these products can't exist.
[2603.64 --> 2607.64]  Dude, it is some moon logic.
[2607.64 --> 2610.64]  Like, makes literally no technical sense.
[2610.64 --> 2614.64]  Like, like, like, like, like fall of an empire.
[2614.64 --> 2622.64]  People who have no idea what any of this is are making decisions that have no basis in logic or reality.
[2622.64 --> 2625.64]  Um, and it's very troubling.
[2625.64 --> 2635.64]  However, however, I was chatting with Alex, um, and he has a theory that, oh, hold on, we should do a recap of the 5060.
[2635.64 --> 2636.64]  Okay, so 5060.
[2636.64 --> 2640.64]  It's 8 gigs, uh, 128-bit bus, it's $300.
[2640.64 --> 2645.64]  It loses to the 3060 TI and ARC B580 in some tests.
[2645.64 --> 2652.64]  Uh, multiple creators like Hardware Unboxed, Jay's Two Cents, Paul's Hardware Digital Foundry and more have criticized both the card.
[2652.64 --> 2659.64]  And this is where we get into sort of Nvidia's, um, not playing ball, um, fairly.
[2659.64 --> 2666.64]  I think, I think, I've, I've talked about, I've talked about this phrase a lot, I think, in the last couple of years is good faith.
[2666.64 --> 2668.64]  You know, what does good faith mean?
[2668.64 --> 2669.64]  Engaging in good faith, right?
[2669.64 --> 2674.64]  It means that, you know, being most, for the most part, right?
[2674.64 --> 2681.64]  Forthright, honest, uh, working together on, you know, a solution that benefits everybody.
[2681.64 --> 2686.64]  And, and, and I, I think that's what the media asks for from companies, right?
[2686.64 --> 2691.64]  Is can we work together in good faith, understanding the value that we each bring to the table?
[2691.64 --> 2701.64]  I understand Nvidia, the value that you are bringing to the table by providing me with the card early so that I can test it and evaluate it.
[2701.64 --> 2704.64]  That has a positive effect on my business.
[2704.64 --> 2707.64]  That is, that also has a positive reflect on the audience.
[2707.64 --> 2709.64]  And positive effect on the audience.
[2709.64 --> 2711.64]  Yeah, so that has a positive effect on my business.
[2711.64 --> 2721.64]  It also has a positive effect on the audience who gets to have all the reviews, multiple perspectives, which Luke and I have always stressed, is extremely,
[2721.64 --> 2730.64]  important, all of which had ample time to put together their analysis and, and present it in a way that is professional and, and thorough.
[2730.64 --> 2735.64]  Without being pushed or, or forced really to say anything in particular.
[2735.64 --> 2737.64]  Very key, very key.
[2737.64 --> 2740.64]  And that's part of Nvidia's benefit.
[2740.64 --> 2750.64]  What Nvidia gets in return is the credibility of these quotes that, hey, this card is good, or it's, uh, really well optimized for that, that they can then use,
[2750.64 --> 2754.64]  to market that card without having to pay for it.
[2754.64 --> 2760.64]  Actually, my understanding is a lot of publications do charge for them to have the, the logo or the badge or the quote or whatever.
[2760.64 --> 2761.64]  We don't.
[2761.64 --> 2765.64]  But in, in a lot of cases, that's the, that's the quid pro quo.
[2765.64 --> 2769.64]  Is, we get access to the card so that we can do a great job.
[2769.64 --> 2776.64]  You get more thorough, more complete information because everybody isn't rushing against each other to be the first to publish.
[2776.64 --> 2780.64]  And Nvidia gets credible, third party validation of their claims about the product.
[2780.64 --> 2783.64]  That is everybody working together in good faith.
[2783.64 --> 2788.64]  And this launch has not been handled well.
[2788.64 --> 2792.64]  Reviewers were not given drivers in time for the initial embargo.
[2792.64 --> 2802.64]  Um, we actually, it's, it's kind of funny to me that right now, this time, exactly now, is when everybody's like really mad about this.
[2802.64 --> 2812.64]  Um, we made a video, one month ago now, about the situation where Nvidia wasn't providing drivers for the 8 gig variants of the 4060 series.
[2812.64 --> 2817.64]  And we basically said exactly what they've done now.
[2817.64 --> 2829.64]  Which is, it looks like what they're trying to do is they're trying to create an environment where all the reviews of, when you search for keyword 4060, are going to be of the TI-16 gig.
[2829.64 --> 2836.64]  Because they're just not even going to bother seeding these other cards and they're going to kind of try to, try to bury it and make sure that it doesn't get covered that much.
[2836.64 --> 2845.64]  So therefore, the best performing videos on the topic of 4060 are going to be for this card that performs markedly, markedly better.
[2845.64 --> 2849.64]  Um, hey, it came to pass, we're mad about it now.
[2849.64 --> 2855.64]  Um, I don't know whose permission we were waiting for to be mad about, but hey, we're all on the same page now.
[2855.64 --> 2861.64]  Um, but there's another layer that is actually, that is actually worse.
[2861.64 --> 2866.64]  Um, and this is, this is, this is, um, this is not good.
[2866.64 --> 2871.64]  Some creators were given access to the drivers ahead of time.
[2871.64 --> 2885.64]  But, only if they agreed to certain stipulations, like testing games at 1080p, including older cards like the RTX 2060 and 3060, or even requiring multi-frame gen results to be included.
[2885.64 --> 2888.64]  Now I want to make this very clear.
[2888.64 --> 2896.64]  In our review of a 4068 gig, should we do one, we would seek to include older cards.
[2896.64 --> 2897.64]  5060.
[2897.64 --> 2899.64]  We would include, oh sorry, thank you.
[2899.64 --> 2900.64]  5060.
[2900.64 --> 2904.64]  We would seek to include older cards because I think that's really relevant, especially if they have a-
[2904.64 --> 2906.64]  You want to track what people would actually be upgrading for.
[2906.64 --> 2907.64]  Large install base.
[2907.64 --> 2908.64]  Yeah.
[2908.64 --> 2909.64]  Okay.
[2909.64 --> 2911.64]  We would include multi-frame gen tests.
[2911.64 --> 2912.64]  We, we have done.
[2912.64 --> 2913.64]  Um.
[2913.64 --> 2918.64]  A lot of people are turning those settings on, even if a lot of people in the comments are really angry about it.
[2918.64 --> 2923.64]  But what we wouldn't be doing is limiting our testing to that.
[2923.64 --> 2926.64]  Because that does not paint the entire picture.
[2926.64 --> 2931.64]  So, Nvidia did exactly what I predicted they would do.
[2931.64 --> 2938.64]  But they actually took it a step further than I thought that they were capable of.
[2938.64 --> 2944.64]  And that last part, we should be extremely upset about.
[2944.64 --> 2950.64]  It's not the first time that Nvidia has teased a card through select media.
[2950.64 --> 2954.64]  In fact, we have participated in that before.
[2954.64 --> 2956.64]  We did, we were the first to game on the 3090.
[2956.64 --> 2962.64]  I think it was us and MKBHD went live with 3090 videos before the review embargo.
[2962.64 --> 2967.64]  But in that situation, it was clearly not a review.
[2967.64 --> 2975.64]  There were stipulations on what we could show, but all of that was communicated extremely transparently.
[2975.64 --> 2978.64]  It was a, it was a preview.
[2978.64 --> 2979.64]  Whereas.
[2979.64 --> 2988.64]  I also tend to not mind like if a, if a manufacturer is like, hey, we really want to show off this particular use case.
[2988.64 --> 2991.64]  It's not necessarily a bad thing to include.
[2991.64 --> 2994.64]  But you should still include the things that you want to include.
[2994.64 --> 3003.64]  And you can mention in that part of your video, like, uh, X manufacturer, X company, whatever, thinks this use case is important.
[3003.64 --> 3006.64]  And then give your opinion on why you agree or don't agree.
[3006.64 --> 3009.64]  Uh, I don't know. I think that's fine.
[3009.64 --> 3017.64]  So, lame. Um, and like.
[3017.64 --> 3027.64]  Not to be surprised. It, it's, it's kind of sad to me that Nvidia seemed to get, um, pretty cool leading up to the 5000 series launch.
[3027.64 --> 3028.64]  Yeah.
[3028.64 --> 3033.64]  And then they're just like, yeah, we're not releasing, you know, new cards for probably like two years anyway.
[3033.64 --> 3034.64]  So, pfft.
[3034.64 --> 3035.64]  So I want to talk about that.
[3035.64 --> 3036.64]  Whatever.
[3036.64 --> 3037.64]  I want to talk about that.
[3037.64 --> 3040.64]  Um, I had a chat with Alex.
[3040.64 --> 3043.64]  Uh, we just like bumped into each other in the lobby.
[3043.64 --> 3046.64]  Cause we're staying in the same hotel, you know, things that happen.
[3046.64 --> 3047.64]  Yeah.
[3047.64 --> 3065.64]  Um, and he had an interesting theory that Nvidia's behavior right now is not born out of malice, but is born out of just utter incompetence.
[3067.64 --> 3068.64]  Hold on.
[3068.64 --> 3069.64]  Let me get there for a second.
[3069.64 --> 3071.64]  Give me a second to get there.
[3071.64 --> 3075.64]  When I, I was very specific about the words born out of.
[3075.64 --> 3089.64]  Um, so his theory is that after the 5090, the 50 series, and, and, and his theory is like, you know, there's a lot of evidence to back this up is that the rollout of the 50 series has been a cluster.
[3089.64 --> 3090.64]  Oh yeah.
[3090.64 --> 3092.64]  Like there was the black screening issue.
[3092.64 --> 3100.64]  There was the issue with, uh, cards, not having, um, the, the right number of, uh, CUDA cores in them.
[3100.64 --> 3102.64]  They somehow managed to still ship that connector.
[3102.64 --> 3104.64]  They shipped some with more.
[3104.64 --> 3115.64]  Uh, they, yeah, the, the, the, the engineering oversight on the 5090 with the, uh, with the, uh, pin balancing the, uh, I mean, what, what else has there been?
[3115.64 --> 3116.64]  Oh, okay.
[3116.64 --> 3125.64]  I mean, there's the fact that there's the fact that they're announcing 50, 60 laptops here at Computex and you still can't buy a 50, 70 laptop.
[3125.64 --> 3126.64]  Did you notice that?
[3126.64 --> 3127.64]  Did you notice that?
[3127.64 --> 3129.64]  I never put that together, but that's rough.
[3129.64 --> 3130.64]  Well, dude.
[3130.64 --> 3131.64]  Yeah?
[3131.64 --> 3144.64]  Like, the, I, I, I, I don't, I don't think that the G-Force side at Nvidia is either being resourced correctly or, um, prioritized.
[3144.64 --> 3145.64]  Prioritized?
[3145.64 --> 3155.64]  There's that, there's that story, I don't know if we talked about it on WAN Show if I just heard this somewhere, but, um, Jensen was talking to their, whatever, I'm gonna assume the title here, but like, head of AI at Nvidia.
[3155.64 --> 3166.64]  Um, and said to imagine every Nvidia employee standing in the parking lot and that they were all available and ready to work for AI.
[3166.64 --> 3170.64]  So basically you can loot any team in the company for whoever you want.
[3170.64 --> 3174.64]  And that, I'm sure that happened to G-Force to a certain degree.
[3174.64 --> 3177.64]  So, so, let's come back to my very specific wording.
[3177.64 --> 3193.64]  I don't think that this was born out of malice, but I think that once your back is against the wall, I think you start to, I think you start to find underhanded ways to dodge accountability.
[3193.64 --> 3200.64]  I think that, I think that in order to, I think that, I think this is an exercise in butt covering.
[3200.64 --> 3207.64]  I think trying to cover up how crap 5060 is, I think this is, and this is never.
[3207.64 --> 3210.64]  So, I guess what you're saying is it wasn't premeditated.
[3210.64 --> 3211.64]  Yes.
[3211.64 --> 3215.64]  Things started to go bad and then they did bad things.
[3215.64 --> 3216.64]  Yes.
[3216.64 --> 3219.64]  That's my, that's my theory.
[3219.64 --> 3220.64]  Okay.
[3220.64 --> 3229.64]  That's my theory, because I think you and I have both met a lot of technical people at Nvidia who would never dream of misleading about the product.
[3229.64 --> 3230.64]  Sure.
[3230.64 --> 3232.64]  The technical guys there are so good.
[3232.64 --> 3248.64]  They, I mean, they literally, Nvidia literally built the industry standard tools for, or built industry standard tools for testing, you know, frame times and GPU power monitoring.
[3248.64 --> 3250.64]  That tend to be like pretty well respected and fair.
[3250.64 --> 3254.64]  They really like care about, you know, making a great product.
[3254.64 --> 3260.64]  So let's not imagine for a second that the technical folks there are not aware of issues.
[3260.64 --> 3261.64]  Yeah.
[3261.64 --> 3262.64]  Right.
[3262.64 --> 3267.64]  And, and, and if you talk to them about it, they're, they're like, yeah, yeah, this one's like really good at this.
[3267.64 --> 3270.64]  And this is a challenge in this, you know, scenario.
[3270.64 --> 3297.64]  And so if I had to guess, I'd say this just basically comes down to the same kinds of issues that, you know, we'd run into with, with Intel during the stagnation years where you just have, you know, these business monsters, these executives that are just looking to cover their hide and figure out how to get their quarterly bonus by covering up the, the products that aren't, you know, aren't that good.
[3297.64 --> 3302.64]  Like, I don't know, the media won't notice or whatever.
[3302.64 --> 3310.64]  And it just, it just sucks because I feel bad for all those really incredible technical people who are really trying to build the best possible product.
[3310.64 --> 3312.64]  I mean, this is, that's fair.
[3312.64 --> 3315.64]  This is a similar story, like all the time, right?
[3315.64 --> 3318.64]  You have the same thing with developers at gaming companies.
[3318.64 --> 3329.64]  Like the, the people working on the thing itself are not making the marketing and business decisions at the company, but they catch a lot of the flack.
[3329.64 --> 3332.64]  And a lot of times they're the ones making the thing.
[3332.64 --> 3333.64]  So it's their baby.
[3333.64 --> 3340.64]  So they feel the flack more heavily than some of the people making the decisions around how it's marketed, how it's communicated, stuff like that.
[3340.64 --> 3341.64]  Yeah.
[3341.64 --> 3349.64]  I saw a really cool quote from someone at take two that was basically just like, yeah, I don't know, rockstar, we just leave them alone.
[3349.64 --> 3350.64]  Yeah.
[3350.64 --> 3351.64]  The CEO.
[3351.64 --> 3352.64]  Was it?
[3352.64 --> 3353.64]  Yeah.
[3353.64 --> 3354.64]  I don't know.
[3354.64 --> 3355.64]  I just came across it and I was like, yeah, that's cool.
[3355.64 --> 3356.64]  Yeah.
[3356.64 --> 3357.64]  It was sweet.
[3357.64 --> 3358.64]  I wonder if I can find it.
[3358.64 --> 3361.64]  Like, dude, can you imagine?
[3361.64 --> 3366.64]  I mean, okay, look, the, the technical folks don't always make sustainable business decisions.
[3366.64 --> 3374.64]  You know, sometimes it's also a little privileged being like the company that owns rockstar to be like, yeah, we just leave them alone.
[3374.64 --> 3375.64]  They just make billions of dollars.
[3375.64 --> 3377.64]  So we're just like, Oh, it's fine.
[3377.64 --> 3378.64]  Like, yeah, I don't know.
[3378.64 --> 3379.64]  Yes.
[3379.64 --> 3380.64]  Yes.
[3380.64 --> 3381.64]  Yes.
[3381.64 --> 3384.64]  And if rockstar, you know, wasn't, you know, making what was it?
[3384.64 --> 3388.64]  They're still making like a quarter billion dollars a quarter on GTA five.
[3388.64 --> 3389.64]  Yeah.
[3389.64 --> 3393.64]  And I think over $200 million a quarter on red dead redemption.
[3393.64 --> 3403.64]  So apparently the, it's a, I can't show you guys, but a games radar, uh, article that says take twos.
[3403.64 --> 3412.64]  CEO is probably the world's only person to refuse the chance to play GTA six, uh, because I'm not a gamer and his role is to get out of their way.
[3412.64 --> 3415.64]  So basically like he didn't want to play it and then have comments.
[3415.64 --> 3420.64]  And then, you know, maybe he says something, someone hears something and then something's actioned because of it.
[3420.64 --> 3423.64]  Cause he's just like, I'm business.
[3423.64 --> 3424.64]  Yeah.
[3424.64 --> 3425.64]  This is not me.
[3425.64 --> 3426.64]  I'm going to do business.
[3426.64 --> 3427.64]  Do your thing.
[3427.64 --> 3428.64]  Yeah.
[3428.64 --> 3429.64]  Make games.
[3429.64 --> 3430.64]  It's like, all right, dude, I don't know, man.
[3430.64 --> 3431.64]  I get, yeah.
[3431.64 --> 3432.64]  Very privileged.
[3432.64 --> 3437.64]  If you're going to be the CEO of a gaming company and you're not a gamer, that's probably the way to approach it.
[3437.64 --> 3438.64]  I like that.
[3438.64 --> 3439.64]  To be honest.
[3439.64 --> 3440.64]  I respect it.
[3440.64 --> 3441.64]  Yeah.
[3441.64 --> 3442.64]  I respect it.
[3442.64 --> 3443.64]  I respect it.
[3443.64 --> 3446.64]  Cause when you have like, uh, um, and like, okay.
[3446.64 --> 3458.64]  I mean, our very own CEO, Mr. Taron Tong will occasionally like pitch into me with like content ideas, but he's always like, or just don't.
[3458.64 --> 3461.64]  I fully recognize that this is like, not my world.
[3461.64 --> 3462.64]  Yeah.
[3462.64 --> 3470.64]  You've been doing this for 20 years and I've been a fly on the wall watching you do it on the content side of things for, you know, two years.
[3470.64 --> 3472.64]  You know, yeah, whatever.
[3472.64 --> 3479.64]  Um, and to his credit, occasionally the ideas are really good and the dynamic for us is a little different.
[3479.64 --> 3481.64]  So I can't really like feel that pressure.
[3481.64 --> 3482.64]  Right.
[3482.64 --> 3483.64]  Right.
[3483.64 --> 3484.64]  Cause he's my boss, but I'm also his boss.
[3484.64 --> 3485.64]  Yeah.
[3485.64 --> 3487.64]  I'm my own grandpa, you know, like that whole thing.
[3487.64 --> 3488.64]  Right.
[3488.64 --> 3501.64]  Um, but I, I appreciate and respect when people can be a leader of a company, but also recognize that they are not an expert in what all the people at that company do.
[3501.64 --> 3502.64]  Yeah.
[3502.64 --> 3505.64]  Um, probably a very small percentage of them realistically.
[3505.64 --> 3506.64]  Dude.
[3506.64 --> 3509.64]  I, oh man, the bigger we get, the more I noticed that.
[3509.64 --> 3510.64]  Yeah.
[3510.64 --> 3514.64]  Is like, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll be like, Hey, what are you working on?
[3514.64 --> 3515.64]  And someone's like working on something.
[3515.64 --> 3516.64]  I'm like, cool.
[3516.64 --> 3526.64]  Even within my teams, like what I'm often looking for is a strong and well reasoned argument, not a thing that I necessarily premeditated.
[3526.64 --> 3533.64]  Cause all the times it's like, I have no idea, but based on what you're saying, is it like pretty obvious that you've done your research and this like makes sense?
[3533.64 --> 3534.64]  Yeah.
[3534.64 --> 3535.64]  Okay.
[3535.64 --> 3536.64]  Cool.
[3536.64 --> 3537.64]  Go for it.
[3537.64 --> 3538.64]  Yeah.
[3538.64 --> 3542.64]  Like, uh, with the camera ops, I'll be like, Hey, what do you think of this angle?
[3542.64 --> 3548.64]  Because I know that if I say, you know, do this angle, I'm going to get cooked.
[3548.64 --> 3549.64]  Yeah.
[3549.64 --> 3551.64]  Cause they, they know the angles better than I know the angles.
[3551.64 --> 3552.64]  Yeah.
[3552.64 --> 3553.64]  They're looking at the viewfinder.
[3553.64 --> 3559.64]  But sometimes it is reasonable to ask cause you know, maybe they've been rushing or whatever and they just didn't really think about it.
[3559.64 --> 3560.64]  Yeah.
[3560.64 --> 3568.64]  Maybe they were setting up all the gear while I've been kind of standing looking around or, or maybe I have an idea for how I want it to flow into the next shot or, you know, whatever.
[3568.64 --> 3573.64]  And it's gotta be a collaborative process, but you gotta let experts cook.
[3573.64 --> 3574.64]  Yeah.
[3574.64 --> 3575.64]  There's just no other way around it.
[3575.64 --> 3579.64]  What the heck are we supposed to be talking about?
[3579.64 --> 3585.64]  Uh, do you think, okay.
[3585.64 --> 3590.64]  You gotta, you gotta real talk.
[3590.64 --> 3591.64]  Okay.
[3591.64 --> 3592.64]  Yeah.
[3592.64 --> 3593.64]  Okay.
[3593.64 --> 3594.64]  One of my big things, right.
[3594.64 --> 3602.64]  Is I, I have people around me that help me help keep me accountable, you know, and help me not just, you know, lash out emotionally.
[3602.64 --> 3605.64]  Sometimes, um, I do it anyway.
[3605.64 --> 3606.64]  Yeah.
[3606.64 --> 3607.64]  Nice.
[3607.64 --> 3621.64]  But, yeah, we've been taking some flack for making a video about a golden 5090 at a time when other people are holding Nvidia accountable.
[3621.64 --> 3624.64]  Um, yeah, as if we're not.
[3624.64 --> 3627.64]  As if we didn't talk about this a month ago.
[3627.64 --> 3631.64]  Um, as if we don't have a, a long history.
[3631.64 --> 3637.64]  I actually, I actually compiled a list of times, uh, LTT held Nvidia accountable.
[3637.64 --> 3650.64]  It goes back almost 10 years and includes basically every major thing, project green light, um, G force partner program, when they turned off overclocking on their laptops and they blah, blah, blah.
[3650.64 --> 3652.64]  There's, there's all kinds of things.
[3652.64 --> 3657.64]  Um, would it be an emotional and unnecessary response?
[3657.64 --> 3658.64]  And I'm talking to you guys as well.
[3658.64 --> 3660.64]  So it was probably the up float plane check.
[3660.64 --> 3661.64]  Can you relax?
[3661.64 --> 3662.64]  Okay.
[3662.64 --> 3669.64]  Would it be an unnecessary and emotional response for me to do a video basically going, okay, here's what Nvidia is doing right now.
[3669.64 --> 3681.64]  Um, the title I have in mind is, um, why is LTT silent about Nvidia's media manipulation?
[3681.64 --> 3683.64]  Despite not having been.
[3683.64 --> 3701.64]  And then basically the video lays out the, the many, many not silent times, you know, back when hardware unboxed was being bullied by Nvidia and, uh, Nvidia was basically saying cover RTX more favorably, or you will never see the card to you again.
[3701.64 --> 3704.64]  Um, you know, do I have to lay this out?
[3704.64 --> 3709.64]  Because a lot of people don't seem to have a clue.
[3709.64 --> 3714.64]  I think you could, but I think your tone matters a lot.
[3714.64 --> 3720.64]  What if my tone was as deeply sarcastic as I have ever been in my life?
[3720.64 --> 3722.64]  Yeah, I think that wouldn't be good.
[3722.64 --> 3723.64]  Okay.
[3723.64 --> 3724.64]  Let me pitch you.
[3724.64 --> 3725.64]  Let me pitch this.
[3725.64 --> 3726.64]  Let me pitch this.
[3726.64 --> 3727.64]  Oh, you wrote it already?
[3727.64 --> 3728.64]  Let me pitch this.
[3728.64 --> 3729.64]  Okay.
[3729.64 --> 3733.64]  This is, this is, this is one of the, this is just kind of how Linus thinks sometimes.
[3733.64 --> 3734.64]  I haven't written it already.
[3734.64 --> 3735.64]  Yeah.
[3735.64 --> 3736.64]  Okay.
[3736.64 --> 3737.64]  So it's notes.
[3737.64 --> 3738.64]  I have some notes.
[3738.64 --> 3740.64]  I have a couple notes, but I do have kind of a, I do have kind of a concept for it that I think.
[3740.64 --> 3741.64]  This is sometimes just how he thinks.
[3741.64 --> 3743.64]  That I think is really fun.
[3743.64 --> 3744.64]  Okay.
[3744.64 --> 3749.64]  So, um, the title would be like why I've stayed silent about Nvidia and we've got like, you know,
[3749.64 --> 3750.64]  Oh, sorry.
[3750.64 --> 3754.64]  Just, uh, Nardella in Flowplane Chat said made it a Flowplane exclusive.
[3754.64 --> 3759.64]  Uh, just so you know, and just so some of the audience knows, if he did that, it would
[3759.64 --> 3762.64]  be blood in the water like you've never seen.
[3762.64 --> 3763.64]  Yeah.
[3763.64 --> 3764.64]  Yeah.
[3764.64 --> 3768.64]  Anyway, sorry, keep going.
[3768.64 --> 3769.64]  Yeah.
[3769.64 --> 3771.64]  Just in case there's any questions about that.
[3771.64 --> 3772.64]  Yeah.
[3772.64 --> 3777.64]  Uh, so yeah, I'm thinking like with the duct tape across the mouth or something like that.
[3777.64 --> 3778.64]  Nice.
[3778.64 --> 3779.64]  Good.
[3779.64 --> 3780.64]  Yeah.
[3780.64 --> 3785.64]  So, so I, I made a wave of outrage over Nvidia's manipulative and coercive behavior toward their
[3785.64 --> 3786.64]  partners in the media.
[3786.64 --> 3789.64]  Many of you have been asking, why have I been silent?
[3789.64 --> 3790.64]  Yeah.
[3790.64 --> 3794.64]  To answer that question, I guess I'll need to investigate Nvidia's history of behavior toward
[3794.64 --> 3795.64]  their partners in the media.
[3795.64 --> 3799.64]  And since I've been such an obedient little submissive for Nvidia, I'll have to learn about
[3799.64 --> 3800.64]  it.
[3800.64 --> 3801.64]  Okay.
[3801.64 --> 3803.64]  So yeah, cut that bit from the coverage of other media outlets.
[3803.64 --> 3804.64]  Oh, this one looks good.
[3804.64 --> 3805.64]  Yep.
[3805.64 --> 3806.64]  Yep.
[3806.64 --> 3807.64]  All right.
[3807.64 --> 3808.64]  Cut that bit.
[3808.64 --> 3809.64]  Hold on.
[3809.64 --> 3816.64]  So I'm imagining we Photoshop the channel icon and the channel I click on is actually
[3816.64 --> 3817.64]  LTT.
[3817.64 --> 3818.64]  Ah, okay.
[3818.64 --> 3824.64]  And then we do, did you ever watch the spooky fish episode of South Park way back in the
[3824.64 --> 3825.64]  day?
[3825.64 --> 3826.64]  It's from like season two or something.
[3826.64 --> 3831.64]  Basically there's a parallel universe and, uh, here, hold on.
[3831.64 --> 3835.64]  Let me see if I can, uh, let me see if I can find this.
[3835.64 --> 3836.64]  Ah, yes.
[3836.64 --> 3837.64]  I can see if I can find this video.
[3837.64 --> 3842.64]  The evil versions of all the boys look exactly the same, but just have like a crappy, yeah,
[3842.64 --> 3843.64]  a crappy beard.
[3843.64 --> 3850.64]  Um, so I'm imagining as I learn about all the things Nvidia has done over the years, we
[3850.64 --> 3858.64]  actually motion track like a crappy goatee onto the LTT videos that I'm like learning
[3858.64 --> 3859.64]  about it from.
[3859.64 --> 3864.64]  And then we do a big reveal at the end where we like take off the goatee and we're like,
[3864.64 --> 3865.64]  wow.
[3865.64 --> 3866.64]  It was us all along.
[3866.64 --> 3867.64]  It was us all along.
[3867.64 --> 3868.64]  Yeah.
[3868.64 --> 3869.64]  I'm not going to get away with this.
[3869.64 --> 3870.64]  Am I?
[3870.64 --> 3871.64]  I think it's really funny though.
[3871.64 --> 3872.64]  I think you can do it.
[3872.64 --> 3876.64]  I think you got to drop some of the, the, uh, wounded puppy stuff.
[3876.64 --> 3885.64]  Are you, uh, man, I just want the B roll shot of me being an obedient little submissive.
[3885.64 --> 3886.64]  Yeah.
[3886.64 --> 3887.64]  Okay.
[3887.64 --> 3890.64]  Maybe, but I think now he wants it.
[3890.64 --> 3891.64]  It's funny.
[3891.64 --> 3892.64]  You're gross.
[3892.64 --> 3895.64]  It's the, the problem is you got to keep it.
[3895.64 --> 3899.64]  You got to keep it in the funny realm instead of the like, why is everyone mean to me realm?
[3899.64 --> 3904.64]  Oh, I, it's the why is everyone mean to me realm is it's just, it's not going to go.
[3904.64 --> 3905.64]  Okay.
[3905.64 --> 3906.64]  I didn't give you the next line.
[3906.64 --> 3908.64]  When I clicked the channel, I'm like, whoa, that guy and I could be brothers.
[3908.64 --> 3912.64]  Let's see what he has to say about the most recent fiasco about limiting review samples
[3912.64 --> 3914.64]  and drivers for the RTX 50, 60 series.
[3914.64 --> 3917.64]  And then I kind of watch a short clip from it.
[3917.64 --> 3918.64]  I'm outraged.
[3920.64 --> 3927.64]  Um, anyway, so I was kind of thinking it'll be, it'll be very tongue in cheek, or maybe we
[3927.64 --> 3932.64]  just won't do it, but I don't think it's a bad thing necessarily.
[3932.64 --> 3937.64]  Cause I, and we talked about this recently where like, I think sometimes in moments like
[3937.64 --> 3944.64]  this, it makes sense to just kind of have a, a open discussion with the audience.
[3944.64 --> 3948.64]  And I think a problem that we've been having, I've been talking about this literally for
[3948.64 --> 3954.64]  years at this point, a really big problem that this niche has been having for a while.
[3954.64 --> 3960.64]  And it's weird because for many, many years, this was not a problem at all, but this has
[3960.64 --> 3964.64]  become a major problem over the last few years.
[3964.64 --> 3972.64]  Um, is that if, if any reviewer is not saying the exact same thing as every single other reviewer,
[3972.64 --> 3975.64]  they are condemned.
[3975.64 --> 3978.64]  And it's everything, it's not just us.
[3978.64 --> 3979.64]  I'm not just saying us.
[3979.64 --> 3981.64]  I have seen this with other creators as well.
[3981.64 --> 3982.64]  Yeah.
[3982.64 --> 3983.64]  That sucks.
[3983.64 --> 3984.64]  That is super bad as an audience.
[3984.64 --> 3985.64]  You should not want that.
[3985.64 --> 3988.64]  That is, that is horrible for you.
[3988.64 --> 3990.64]  And it's horrible for the, for the creator.
[3990.64 --> 3994.64]  So once the video transitions into the more serious side, coffee, Kodachi.
[3994.64 --> 3995.64]  Yes.
[3995.64 --> 3996.64]  That would be the plan.
[3996.64 --> 4000.64]  Um, you know, I've got this kind of line when I'm, when I say anything positive about
[4000.64 --> 4001.64]  Nvidia, I'm labeled a shill.
[4001.64 --> 4004.64]  When I say anything negative, I'm labeled a hater.
[4004.64 --> 4008.64]  In this polarized world, a person like me who calls out good and calls out bad ends
[4008.64 --> 4011.64]  up outcast by both camps.
[4011.64 --> 4013.64]  Is that really what we want?
[4013.64 --> 4015.64]  I don't think that's what we want.
[4015.64 --> 4016.64]  You're making it about you again.
[4016.64 --> 4018.64]  I think you should be talking about the industry.
[4018.64 --> 4023.64]  I'm literally responding to people being like, how can you say anything that is different
[4023.64 --> 4026.64]  from what other people are saying right now?
[4026.64 --> 4028.64]  How can I talk about this card?
[4028.64 --> 4031.64]  I think that's the card, which actually I don't even, that's the really bizarre one
[4031.64 --> 4038.64]  is a lot of the like, why are you covering Nvidia positively comments are on the video of this
[4038.64 --> 4045.64]  card where I kid you not, the first line of it is mocking how the 5090 is overpriced.
[4045.64 --> 4047.64]  Literally the very first line.
[4047.64 --> 4053.64]  You don't even have to like, you don't even have to make it past the midway point in the
[4053.64 --> 4055.64]  video, which I know that most people don't.
[4055.64 --> 4056.64]  Yeah.
[4056.64 --> 4058.64]  You have to make it to the first line.
[4058.64 --> 4059.64]  Yeah.
[4059.64 --> 4060.64]  To know that we're taking the piss.
[4060.64 --> 4066.64]  I'm interested because we filmed a short that's not out yet at an internet cafe here
[4066.64 --> 4068.64]  in Taiwan.
[4068.64 --> 4075.64]  And the short opens with like, what the heck is a, cause this was the original reason why
[4075.64 --> 4079.64]  we went to this place nine years ago.
[4079.64 --> 4082.64]  Um, what is an Nvidia certified land center?
[4082.64 --> 4083.64]  Yeah.
[4083.64 --> 4086.64]  And it ends with effectively, they just spent a bunch of money.
[4086.64 --> 4087.64]  Nice.
[4087.64 --> 4094.64]  But I am rather certain that people are going to be like, Ooh, how are you covering this
[4094.64 --> 4095.64]  right now?
[4095.64 --> 4097.64]  And we're literally like, yeah, they just put their badge on the store.
[4097.64 --> 4100.64]  If you like buy enough GPUs and that's it.
[4100.64 --> 4101.64]  We like dope.
[4101.64 --> 4103.64]  We don't praise Nvidia's involvement at all.
[4103.64 --> 4104.64]  Like this is a really cool land center.
[4104.64 --> 4106.64]  And what is the Nvidia part?
[4106.64 --> 4108.64]  They bought a lot of GPUs.
[4108.64 --> 4114.64]  So then how do you get that message across without, you know, to your point, being a wounded
[4114.64 --> 4117.64]  puppy or talking about yourself?
[4117.64 --> 4125.64]  Because at the end of the day, the problem is about like, you know, here's what we're
[4125.64 --> 4127.64]  trying to do and here's why it matters.
[4127.64 --> 4129.64]  And here's why you should probably care.
[4129.64 --> 4137.64]  And why just being in camp for this company or camp against this company is really, really,
[4137.64 --> 4138.64]  really, really bad.
[4138.64 --> 4140.64]  Because it is really, really, really bad.
[4140.64 --> 4146.64]  I wonder as well, like a conversation that Linus and I have been having is, is just that
[4146.64 --> 4159.64]  like, I think we're looking down the barrel of PC hardware in general being a niche that
[4159.64 --> 4165.64]  is, it's, it's following like the, the population trend in most countries.
[4165.64 --> 4167.64]  It's getting older.
[4167.64 --> 4169.64]  There's not as many new entrants.
[4169.64 --> 4175.64]  I was having a conversation with some creators here, which is like, there aren't as many,
[4175.64 --> 4181.64]  there aren't that many like younger PC hardware creators showing up at these events.
[4181.64 --> 4182.64]  Interesting.
[4182.64 --> 4187.64]  Like I know, I was sitting around at a dinner that was like an open invite to basically any
[4187.64 --> 4188.64]  PC hardware creators here.
[4188.64 --> 4189.64]  Yeah.
[4189.64 --> 4191.64]  And most people had gray in their beards.
[4191.64 --> 4192.64]  Like, right.
[4192.64 --> 4193.64]  Yeah.
[4193.64 --> 4197.64]  And I was like, hmm, this is interesting.
[4197.64 --> 4201.64]  It doesn't necessarily bode well for like the future of this niche.
[4201.64 --> 4205.64]  And one of the things that doesn't bode well for the future of any niche, unless it's a
[4205.64 --> 4208.64]  niche that's based around social interaction.
[4208.64 --> 4209.64]  And this is not one.
[4209.64 --> 4218.64]  This is a niche that is based around ideally objective product evaluation is drama and chaos.
[4218.64 --> 4223.64]  And it's, it's a problem because when, if you think about if it's a video game, let's go
[4223.64 --> 4224.64]  completely outside of this niche.
[4224.64 --> 4229.64]  If it's a video game and you're a little bit interested in the video game, and you go
[4229.64 --> 4231.64]  onto the subreddit for that video game.
[4231.64 --> 4232.64]  Oh God.
[4232.64 --> 4233.64]  And it's just on fire.
[4233.64 --> 4234.64]  Yeah.
[4234.64 --> 4235.64]  Don't do that.
[4235.64 --> 4236.64]  Never go to the subreddit for something you like.
[4236.64 --> 4238.64]  Are you more or less interested in that game now?
[4238.64 --> 4239.64]  Less.
[4239.64 --> 4240.64]  Less.
[4240.64 --> 4244.64]  If anything, it's less.
[4244.64 --> 4249.64]  Like we're not, this isn't inviting.
[4249.64 --> 4251.64]  Here's my problem though.
[4251.64 --> 4260.84]  And this is, this is what I keep running into is every time I tell myself, Hey, I want to
[4260.84 --> 4262.64]  be a voice of positivity.
[4262.64 --> 4266.64]  You know, I want to, I want to be excited about things.
[4266.64 --> 4271.64]  Um, something like terrible happens.
[4271.64 --> 4279.64]  Like it is, it is legitimately not cool and very anti consumer.
[4279.64 --> 4289.64]  And I, I blame all of the big players, literally all of them, AMD, Intel, Nvidia, your key guys.
[4289.64 --> 4295.64]  I blame all of them for the fact that naming schemes are a cluster.
[4295.64 --> 4300.64]  They are in my opinion and this, so I'm making it very clear.
[4300.64 --> 4305.64]  This is allegedly, they are intentionally misleading.
[4305.64 --> 4306.64]  Oh yeah.
[4306.64 --> 4310.64]  They intentionally obfuscate product information.
[4310.64 --> 4311.64]  Every launch.
[4311.64 --> 4314.64]  To make it easier to sell older generation hardware.
[4314.64 --> 4315.64]  Yep.
[4315.64 --> 4317.64]  I understand why they do it.
[4317.64 --> 4323.64]  Because if you can just, not just, not necessarily just older generation hardware, but, but lower
[4323.64 --> 4326.64]  end, cheaper, something less expensive.
[4326.64 --> 4332.64]  Um, and so how am I supposed to stay positive?
[4332.64 --> 4333.64]  Yeah.
[4333.64 --> 4336.64]  Like you don't, I don't, um, and that's the other thing.
[4336.64 --> 4337.64]  You can't be positive all the time.
[4337.64 --> 4341.64]  Like my whole, oh, if everything's on fire all the time, it's not very inviting community.
[4341.64 --> 4342.64]  Yeah.
[4342.64 --> 4350.64]  I, I'm going to stand behind that statement, but you also just can't leave these companies
[4350.64 --> 4352.64]  doing horrible things alone.
[4352.64 --> 4353.64]  We're reviewers.
[4353.64 --> 4354.64]  We need to point it out.
[4354.64 --> 4355.64]  Right.
[4355.64 --> 4356.64]  But, but.
[4356.64 --> 4359.64]  So then back to, okay, how do I not be, how do I not address it?
[4359.64 --> 4364.64]  When I make a video that isn't even like positive, it's just about a thing.
[4364.64 --> 4365.64]  Yeah.
[4365.64 --> 4370.64]  And I'm not negative enough or I'm not on the right negative bandwagon.
[4370.64 --> 4373.64]  I'm sitting here going like, y'all exhausting.
[4373.64 --> 4374.64]  Yeah.
[4374.64 --> 4375.64]  Yeah.
[4375.64 --> 4376.64]  Yeah.
[4376.64 --> 4379.64]  Like I, and, and you know what?
[4379.64 --> 4382.64]  It's, it's a good comment, right?
[4382.64 --> 4385.64]  Like Linus, you should just not care about the feedback at all.
[4385.64 --> 4386.64]  And just like, do your thing.
[4386.64 --> 4388.64]  Just, you know, make whatever, whatever video you want.
[4388.64 --> 4393.64]  But it's, it's, it's not, it's not that easy.
[4393.64 --> 4395.64]  It's not, it's not that simple.
[4395.64 --> 4400.64]  I, I wish that, I wish that I didn't have to care at all.
[4400.64 --> 4403.64]  You know, what people, what people think of the videos.
[4403.64 --> 4407.64]  Um, you know, if you, if you're just like, yeah, Linus, just like be you and you know,
[4407.64 --> 4409.64]  we'll check out your, your, your content.
[4409.64 --> 4414.64]  It's like, but I've always been someone who obsessively reads the comments and tries
[4414.64 --> 4417.64]  to, tries to cater to the audience.
[4417.64 --> 4423.64]  That is literally, you go to any YouTube conference, you go to any creator meetup.
[4423.64 --> 4425.64]  Hey, what's one of the keys to success?
[4425.64 --> 4426.64]  Know your audience.
[4426.64 --> 4427.64]  Yeah.
[4427.64 --> 4428.64]  Interact with your audience.
[4428.64 --> 4431.64]  Understand, understand your audience.
[4431.64 --> 4443.64]  Um, and if the audience, you know, wants to be up on this like, you know, scummy behavior or this like, incredibly, you know, boring product or, you know, whatever.
[4443.64 --> 4449.64]  I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because if I make a video about a boring product, that's inherently a boring video.
[4449.64 --> 4453.64]  And if I don't make a video about this boring product, then I'm silent.
[4453.64 --> 4461.64]  And it's like, yo, I, you know, I, I, I don't.
[4461.64 --> 4469.64]  And, and so you have this like conflicting feedback, none of which is right, because I promise you that, you know, people are not going to tune into that.
[4469.64 --> 4471.64]  They don't, it doesn't resonate with them.
[4471.64 --> 4473.64]  Boredom doesn't sell.
[4473.64 --> 4474.64]  Yeah.
[4474.64 --> 4480.64]  Um, and I wish I had, I wish I had solutions.
[4480.64 --> 4483.64]  I wish I had solutions here, but, uh, yeah.
[4483.64 --> 4489.64]  Like my whole comment on the, like, Oh, the Nvidia land center certification is just buying some GPUs.
[4489.64 --> 4494.64]  That's at the very end of the short because it's really boring.
[4494.64 --> 4496.64]  We didn't know the answer before we showed up.
[4496.64 --> 4506.64]  Um, when we figured out the answer, we were like, Oh, I mean, I guess we'll answer the question considering the question is at the beginning of the short, but it is boring.
[4506.64 --> 4508.64]  So we will put it at the very end.
[4508.64 --> 4512.64]  By the way, I've lost the comment now, but, um, I'm going to have to give this to you.
[4512.64 --> 4515.64]  Um, this is my geek card.
[4515.64 --> 4518.64]  I don't get to carry it anymore because no, I'm not.
[4518.64 --> 4524.64]  Because no, I did not realize that the beards on the South Park episode were a Star Trek reference.
[4524.64 --> 4530.64]  Oh, I, uh, do I have to like throw this away?
[4530.64 --> 4531.64]  I didn't either.
[4531.64 --> 4532.64]  What?
[4532.64 --> 4533.64]  I didn't either.
[4533.64 --> 4534.64]  Oh, really?
[4534.64 --> 4535.64]  I don't think either of us get it.
[4535.64 --> 4536.64]  Get it out of here.
[4536.64 --> 4537.64]  Yeah.
[4537.64 --> 4539.64]  Well, that's my, I mean, that's my room key actually, but yeah.
[4539.64 --> 4540.64]  You don't have to go back.
[4540.64 --> 4541.64]  I might need to, yeah.
[4541.64 --> 4542.64]  Nope.
[4542.64 --> 4543.64]  But my stuff's in there.
[4543.64 --> 4544.64]  Uh-huh.
[4544.64 --> 4545.64]  Too bad.
[4545.64 --> 4546.64]  Okay.
[4546.64 --> 4549.64]  By the way, this is going to upset some people.
[4549.64 --> 4552.64]  Oh, I have never watched the entire original series.
[4552.64 --> 4553.64]  Me neither.
[4553.64 --> 4555.64]  I have seen bits and pieces.
[4555.64 --> 4556.64]  Me too.
[4556.64 --> 4561.64]  You know, I've seen enough, you know, bits and pieces that I like very much get the vibe.
[4561.64 --> 4567.64]  I've seen full episodes even, but I have not watched the original series.
[4567.64 --> 4572.64]  I've seen like the one good movie with the whales or whatever, but I was a child.
[4572.64 --> 4574.64]  I was a literal child.
[4574.64 --> 4577.64]  I don't remember anything other than I think there were whales in it.
[4577.64 --> 4578.64]  Yeah.
[4578.64 --> 4579.64]  Uh-oh.
[4579.64 --> 4580.64]  Oh no.
[4580.64 --> 4581.64]  Heresy.
[4581.64 --> 4582.64]  Oh no.
[4582.64 --> 4585.64]  We're just talking about how people shouldn't be mad all the time, then you just piss them
[4585.64 --> 4586.64]  all off.
[4586.64 --> 4587.64]  Okay, I'll watch it.
[4587.64 --> 4588.64]  I'll watch it.
[4588.64 --> 4589.64]  I'll watch it.
[4589.64 --> 4591.64]  I've actually been, I've been watching like old, old media.
[4591.64 --> 4595.64]  I finally watched Mad Max 2.
[4595.64 --> 4596.64]  So I have now seen Mad Max 2.
[4596.64 --> 4597.64]  Okay.
[4597.64 --> 4598.64]  I have finally watched Highlander.
[4598.64 --> 4599.64]  Okay.
[4599.64 --> 4604.64]  There was another, and I'm going to pronounce this in a very specific way.
[4604.64 --> 4611.64]  There was another Linus that, um, for reasons that maybe will become clear in the future,
[4611.64 --> 4615.64]  um, prompted me to watch those movies.
[4615.64 --> 4617.64]  So I have now watched them.
[4617.64 --> 4623.64]  I still have not watched the third Mad Max, which is the last, uh, part of my assignment.
[4623.64 --> 4629.64]  And then hopefully once that happens, um, I will be able to talk about why someone named
[4629.64 --> 4636.64]  Linus, um, felt that I needed to be aware of the cultural significance of these movies.
[4636.64 --> 4638.64]  I'm excited about that.
[4638.64 --> 4639.64]  There will be something.
[4639.64 --> 4640.64]  That's all I'll say.
[4640.64 --> 4644.64]  So that could be maybe something that could, I don't know, who knows?
[4644.64 --> 4646.64]  I mean, you never know, right?
[4646.64 --> 4648.64]  The world's, world's crazy.
[4648.64 --> 4649.64]  World's crazy.
[4649.64 --> 4652.64]  Crazy bad sometimes, crazy good sometimes.
[4652.64 --> 4653.64]  Let's have some fun, you know?
[4653.64 --> 4654.64]  Yeah.
[4654.64 --> 4658.64]  Um, hey, by the way, you guys are probably wondering like what's up with this thing, this tower
[4658.64 --> 4660.64]  that's been between us the whole time.
[4660.64 --> 4668.64]  So, um, a lot of people, I think, didn't manage to pick up on this, even though I literally
[4668.64 --> 4671.64]  held up an invoice for it, but I bought this.
[4671.64 --> 4672.64]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4672.64 --> 4675.64]  This was not a review sample or a gift.
[4675.64 --> 4677.64]  That was like a major part of that video.
[4677.64 --> 4678.64]  Or whatever.
[4678.64 --> 4679.64]  Yeah.
[4679.64 --> 4680.64]  Oh dude.
[4680.64 --> 4681.64]  You even talked about like how to get it home and everything.
[4681.64 --> 4682.64]  It's amazing.
[4682.64 --> 4686.64]  It's amazing what people can manage to not retain in the first like 30 seconds of the
[4686.64 --> 4687.64]  video.
[4687.64 --> 4689.64]  I try not to let it bother me, but as you can tell, it ain't working.
[4689.64 --> 4690.64]  Um, anyway.
[4690.64 --> 4696.64]  So I bought this because, um, and again, a lot of people probably don't, don't know this,
[4696.64 --> 4703.64]  but I skipped 40 series in effectively silent protest because no one really seemed to notice
[4703.64 --> 4704.64]  or care.
[4704.64 --> 4705.64]  What?
[4705.64 --> 4708.64]  I skipped 40 series because of Nvidia's crappy pricing.
[4708.64 --> 4710.64]  Uh, but I don't think so.
[4710.64 --> 4711.64]  You're an Nvidia shill.
[4711.64 --> 4712.64]  Thank you.
[4712.64 --> 4713.64]  Thank you.
[4713.64 --> 4714.64]  Um, so.
[4714.64 --> 4715.64]  Um, so.
[4715.64 --> 4716.64]  You probably just said that.
[4716.64 --> 4717.64]  I'm ready for an upgrade.
[4717.64 --> 4718.64]  And I was like, well.
[4718.64 --> 4720.64]  I'm sure you had 40 90s in every system.
[4720.64 --> 4727.64]  Hey, if I can, uh, if I can get content out of it, then, hey, if I can buy like the,
[4727.64 --> 4733.64]  the golden 50 90, and then I can also get some content out of it, then yeah, you know
[4733.64 --> 4736.64]  what screw it, let's do the bougiest build.
[4736.64 --> 4738.64]  So I could get like a series of videos out of it.
[4738.64 --> 4743.64]  And, uh, you know, that'll, that'll help to absorb some of the ridiculous costs.
[4743.64 --> 4745.64]  You have any idea how much this thing costs?
[4745.64 --> 4747.64]  Did you say like eight grand?
[4747.64 --> 4749.64]  So there's a range.
[4749.64 --> 4751.64]  Oh, there's a range online.
[4751.64 --> 4756.64]  Um, I found out during the handoff that our per, our procurement team was supposed to
[4756.64 --> 4762.64]  have been given a discount code that was supposed to make it closer to the lower end of the range.
[4762.64 --> 4765.64]  Um, they just, we didn't get it.
[4765.64 --> 4766.64]  Nice.
[4766.64 --> 4771.64]  So, uh, I paid about 8,000 us dollars for this GPU.
[4771.64 --> 4772.64]  Sick.
[4772.64 --> 4773.64]  Have you seen it in person?
[4773.64 --> 4774.64]  No.
[4776.64 --> 4779.64]  It's not worth 8,000.
[4781.64 --> 4784.64]  And adding insult to injury, the video didn't get a lot of views.
[4784.64 --> 4785.64]  Yeah.
[4785.64 --> 4791.64]  So it didn't, um, but, but, but, but the, the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan, the
[4791.64 --> 4796.64]  plan is still to, uh, is still to, to, you know, do other content with it.
[4796.64 --> 4797.64]  So hopefully that'll help.
[4797.64 --> 4803.64]  Um, my plan has been disrupted a little bit.
[4803.64 --> 4804.64]  Okay.
[4804.64 --> 4811.64]  Um, because James had a really good idea for, instead of me doing like a golden build or
[4811.64 --> 4815.64]  something like that, which realistically I was going to water cool anyway.
[4815.64 --> 4818.64]  So like, what's the point of a heat sink with gold on it?
[4818.64 --> 4823.64]  Um, I, but I, I kind of thought that would be funny in like a completely twisted eat the rich way.
[4823.64 --> 4828.64]  Is if I buy a golden GPU, literally take all the gold off of it and then put on a water block.
[4828.64 --> 4831.64]  And then I don't know, maybe I'll have to gold plate the water block myself or something.
[4831.64 --> 4832.64]  Yeah.
[4832.64 --> 4834.64]  Anyway, I just, I thought that'd be funny.
[4834.64 --> 4837.64]  You could like, that's edgy.
[4837.64 --> 4838.64]  I'm going to leave that out.
[4838.64 --> 4839.64]  We're good.
[4839.64 --> 4840.64]  No, I'd like to hear it.
[4840.64 --> 4842.64]  Like, so you could like hang it off the front of the case.
[4842.64 --> 4843.64]  I can't put my neck.
[4843.64 --> 4844.64]  Just like wear it.
[4844.64 --> 4845.64]  Sure.
[4845.64 --> 4848.64]  Um, not the way I meant that, but yeah, for sure.
[4848.64 --> 4849.64]  James had a better idea.
[4849.64 --> 4850.64]  Okay.
[4850.64 --> 4853.64]  What if we take it to the tech mall?
[4853.64 --> 4855.64]  Like have that guy?
[4855.64 --> 4856.64]  Or someone.
[4856.64 --> 4857.64]  So I don't want to, I, okay, you know what?
[4857.64 --> 4858.64]  Sure.
[4858.64 --> 4860.64]  I'm going to, I'm going to tease the premise.
[4860.64 --> 4865.64]  I went back to the tech mall, golden Jeepers, and I'm going to go to the tech mall.
[4865.64 --> 4870.64]  And I'm going to go to the tech mall.
[4870.64 --> 4872.64]  Golden GPU in hand.
[4872.64 --> 4875.64]  And I said, okay, I have, this is empty.
[4875.64 --> 4879.64]  I have the Sultan of GPUs.
[4879.64 --> 4883.64]  Who can build me the best throne for it?
[4883.64 --> 4884.64]  Whoa.
[4884.64 --> 4887.64]  And, um, we got, is it a competition?
[4887.64 --> 4892.64]  The quotation slash concept and design part is a competition.
[4892.64 --> 4893.64]  Okay.
[4893.64 --> 4894.64]  Fair.
[4894.64 --> 4896.64]  And we ultimately chose one builder.
[4896.64 --> 4897.64]  Okay.
[4897.64 --> 4899.64]  To build the ultimate throne.
[4899.64 --> 4902.64]  Um, I haven't seen it yet.
[4902.64 --> 4904.64]  Oh, it's in there right now.
[4904.64 --> 4905.64]  It's in there right now.
[4905.64 --> 4906.64]  Dang.
[4906.64 --> 4907.64]  Okay.
[4907.64 --> 4912.64]  So, so, so, so theoretically, this is my new gaming PC in here.
[4912.64 --> 4913.64]  I haven't seen it yet.
[4913.64 --> 4915.64]  So we'll have that video coming.
[4915.64 --> 4924.64]  Um, I recently became aware at the time of picking up the system of a challenge that may
[4924.64 --> 4926.64]  change the concept somewhat.
[4926.64 --> 4929.64]  Um, but I'm going to save that for the video.
[4929.64 --> 4936.64]  Um, I might not get to keep my golden GPU is all I, is all I'll say about that.
[4936.64 --> 4937.64]  Okay.
[4937.64 --> 4938.64]  So guys, stay tuned.
[4938.64 --> 4940.64]  This is going to be, this is going to be pretty fun.
[4940.64 --> 4947.64]  Um, I, I think that if the concept art is anything like the finished system, this is going to
[4947.64 --> 4951.64]  be one of the coolest systems we have ever shown on the channel.
[4951.64 --> 4952.64]  And I hope I'm not hyping this too much.
[4952.64 --> 4954.64]  They must not have had a ton of time.
[4954.64 --> 4961.64]  Uh, the, the builders, um, messaged me in the middle of the night saying, Hey, we're still
[4961.64 --> 4962.64]  up.
[4962.64 --> 4964.64]  We're pulling an all nighter working on this system.
[4964.64 --> 4965.64]  So they went hard.
[4965.64 --> 4966.64]  All right.
[4966.64 --> 4967.64]  They went, they went pretty cray cray.
[4967.64 --> 4968.64]  I'm, I'm pretty excited.
[4968.64 --> 4971.64]  It's going to be, it's, it's going to be pretty cool.
[4971.64 --> 4980.64]  Um, I, I hope that we're allowed to just like do cool things.
[4980.64 --> 4981.64]  Nope.
[4981.64 --> 4982.64]  Yeah.
[4982.64 --> 4983.64]  I don't know.
[4983.64 --> 4984.64]  Put in jail.
[4984.64 --> 4985.64]  Yeah.
[4985.64 --> 4986.64]  Yeah.
[4986.64 --> 4994.00]  I think that's, I think one of my biggest pushes is like we can and should, uh, stand
[4994.00 --> 5001.64]  up to bad practices from, from companies and we have, um, and other creators should as well.
[5001.64 --> 5002.64]  Yeah.
[5002.64 --> 5009.64]  Um, but I don't think that should mean that we have to stop making this a fun niche to be
[5009.64 --> 5010.64]  a niche that just screams all of the time.
[5010.64 --> 5011.64]  Yeah.
[5011.64 --> 5022.64]  Um, and I think that's important to remember because if we do become a niche that just screams
[5022.64 --> 5028.64]  all of the time, we are just begging for our death to be accelerated.
[5028.64 --> 5029.64]  That's it.
[5029.64 --> 5030.64]  And I like building gaming PCs and stuff.
[5030.64 --> 5031.64]  Yeah.
[5031.64 --> 5032.64]  Yeah.
[5032.64 --> 5033.64]  Yeah.
[5033.64 --> 5035.64]  I think it's fun and cool.
[5035.64 --> 5038.00]  Like I think we all started doing this for fun.
[5038.00 --> 5039.00]  Yeah.
[5039.00 --> 5043.00]  And now we're just angry screaming redditors and that's like not cool.
[5043.00 --> 5044.00]  Yeah.
[5044.00 --> 5045.00]  Yeah.
[5045.00 --> 5047.00]  And we should be angry and scream sometimes.
[5047.00 --> 5051.50]  Like I am trying to, I gotta try to keep this measured cause I'm not trying to say we shouldn't
[5051.50 --> 5052.50]  do that.
[5052.50 --> 5059.50]  Like, and each creator should find their own way to stand up against, uh, really negative,
[5059.50 --> 5063.50]  crappy business practices from these companies.
[5063.50 --> 5066.50]  Um, yeah, never go full Reddit though.
[5066.50 --> 5067.50]  Yeah.
[5067.50 --> 5068.50]  Yeah.
[5068.50 --> 5069.50]  There's, there's a difference.
[5069.50 --> 5070.50]  Agreed Hathos.
[5070.50 --> 5071.50]  Yeah.
[5071.50 --> 5072.50]  All right.
[5072.50 --> 5073.50]  What are we supposed to be doing?
[5073.50 --> 5078.50]  Uh, I don't know, probably sponsors or one of our 47 announcements.
[5078.50 --> 5079.50]  Yeah, let's do it.
[5079.50 --> 5081.50]  Let's do sponsors.
[5081.50 --> 5082.50]  We'll do, we'll do sponsors.
[5082.50 --> 5083.50]  Okay.
[5083.50 --> 5084.50]  Yeah.
[5084.50 --> 5085.50]  Wow.
[5085.50 --> 5086.50]  We have not done all of our topics yet.
[5086.50 --> 5089.50]  No, uh, the show is brought to you today by thermal take.
[5089.50 --> 5096.50]  It's not a hot take that this immersion cooled PC that Luke and Sammy checked out is pretty
[5096.50 --> 5102.50]  bad-ass, but, uh, sorry, it's not really meant to hit the market quite yet, but what is
[5102.50 --> 5107.50]  coming soon are thermal takes mind cube AIO coolers and their project edge CPU fans.
[5107.50 --> 5111.50]  We went to take a look this week during Computex and some pretty neat stuff.
[5111.50 --> 5114.50]  They're patented mind cube coolers have four.
[5114.50 --> 5115.50]  Yes.
[5115.50 --> 5123.50]  My friends for seven 20 by seven 20 four inch LCD screens, all able to show unique visuals
[5123.50 --> 5125.50]  or real-time PC info.
[5125.50 --> 5130.50]  The goal for thermal take here was to make it easy to customize and control what you see
[5130.50 --> 5134.50]  with their brand new software, which comes with an AI tool that helps generate an entire
[5134.50 --> 5136.50]  story to play out across all the screens.
[5136.50 --> 5138.50]  Good Lord.
[5138.50 --> 5143.50]  They also showed off their project edge fans, which also have LCD screens on them that are
[5143.50 --> 5148.50]  linkable showing real-time information, pictures, GIFs, and more.
[5148.50 --> 5152.50]  Plus with the magnetic connection, daisy chaining them together and creating a cool seamless design
[5152.50 --> 5153.50]  is a breeze.
[5153.50 --> 5158.50]  They also showed off some new colors for their popular TR 100 mini ITX case now available in
[5158.50 --> 5161.50]  future dusk and gravel sand.
[5161.50 --> 5163.50]  Do you put it on your lawn?
[5163.50 --> 5164.50]  Sorry, sorry.
[5164.50 --> 5167.50]  And they even added two brand new form factors to the line.
[5167.50 --> 5170.50]  The micro ATX TR 200 and the ATX TR 100.
[5170.50 --> 5175.50]  Both come with a front loaded PSU design and support for a six inch LCD display.
[5175.50 --> 5177.50]  Man, these guys really like their displays.
[5177.50 --> 5178.50]  Who can blame them though?
[5178.50 --> 5179.50]  Screens?
[5179.50 --> 5180.50]  They're kind of cool.
[5180.50 --> 5182.50]  Everything is set to come out sometime this year.
[5182.50 --> 5185.50]  So head over to thermaltake.com and keep an eye out for when they're available.
[5185.50 --> 5190.50]  Thanks again to Thermaltake for being the sole sponsor of this week's special Computex 2025
[5190.50 --> 5195.50]  edition of the WAN show or as we call it the Taiwan show.
[5195.50 --> 5196.50]  Aha.
[5196.50 --> 5197.50]  Nope.
[5197.50 --> 5198.50]  Nothing.
[5198.50 --> 5199.50]  Wow.
[5199.50 --> 5200.50]  Not even.
[5200.50 --> 5201.50]  Thanks Andy.
[5201.50 --> 5202.50]  I can do the Final Fantasy one.
[5202.50 --> 5203.50]  Please don't.
[5203.50 --> 5204.50]  Please don't.
[5204.50 --> 5205.50]  That won't be necessary.
[5205.50 --> 5206.50]  Okay.
[5206.50 --> 5207.50]  What do you want to talk about?
[5207.50 --> 5208.50]  Wait, that's it?
[5208.50 --> 5209.50]  We just have one sponsor?
[5209.50 --> 5210.50]  That's it.
[5210.50 --> 5211.50]  Nice.
[5211.50 --> 5212.50]  Do we want to do some of the announcements?
[5212.50 --> 5215.50]  We can do, well let's do whatever Dan tells us.
[5215.50 --> 5216.50]  There's so many of them.
[5216.50 --> 5217.50]  Dan, you're in charge.
[5217.50 --> 5219.50]  Why don't you get through a couple announcements and then we'll just try and go through all of these
[5219.50 --> 5220.50]  topics because there's a couple.
[5220.50 --> 5221.50]  Let's do a couple announcements.
[5221.50 --> 5223.50]  An LTT store first.
[5223.50 --> 5225.50]  Dan, you're going to have to click links and show things I guess.
[5225.50 --> 5226.50]  Yep.
[5226.50 --> 5227.50]  Are you on it?
[5227.50 --> 5228.50]  He's on it.
[5228.50 --> 5230.50]  He's on it like a bonnet.
[5230.50 --> 5232.50]  Like a hood.
[5232.50 --> 5233.50]  Like a hoodie.
[5233.50 --> 5235.50]  Ah, that's pretty good.
[5235.50 --> 5240.50]  We're launching a run of our original hoodie blanks for purchase for the very first time.
[5240.50 --> 5246.50]  Custom made with 100% cotton for comfort and a French terry interior to keep things breathable
[5246.50 --> 5251.50]  because we couldn't find a hoodie out there that felt like how we think a hoodie should feel.
[5251.50 --> 5254.50]  Available now in black and brick.
[5254.50 --> 5256.50]  A darker red.
[5256.50 --> 5261.50]  You can get yours today at lmg.gg slash blank hoodie.
[5261.50 --> 5272.50]  We are also announcing pre-tariff pricing returning to LTT store US for commuter backpacks and magnetic cable management.
[5272.50 --> 5274.50]  This weekend on the US site.
[5274.50 --> 5278.50]  Global customers, you are already getting pre-tariff pricing after conversion.
[5278.50 --> 5281.50]  So technically this is also for you.
[5281.50 --> 5283.50]  So commuter bags and magnetic cable management.
[5283.50 --> 5286.50]  Now's a great time to pick those up if you are in the US.
[5286.50 --> 5292.50]  We've got this, ah, yeah, we've got that all on LTT store dot com.
[5292.50 --> 5294.50]  If you guys want to use one of those items to send a merch message.
[5294.50 --> 5297.50]  Hey, merch messages are the way to interact with the show.
[5297.50 --> 5299.50]  We don't do Twitch bits or super chats.
[5299.50 --> 5304.50]  We like that if you throw your money at the screen, you actually get something in return when you send a merch message.
[5304.50 --> 5307.50]  So all you gotta do is go to LTT store dot com, add something to your cart,
[5307.50 --> 5312.50]  and you'll see a box when we're live that will give you a space to type up a merch message.
[5312.50 --> 5317.50]  It'll go to producer Dan, who I guess is gonna have to turn on his own camera.
[5317.50 --> 5319.50]  There it is. Nice.
[5319.50 --> 5323.50]  It doesn't work as well when I can't turn him off while he's still waving.
[5323.50 --> 5325.50]  I know, I know it's terrible.
[5325.50 --> 5326.50]  Yeah.
[5326.50 --> 5327.50]  You gotta do it to yourself.
[5327.50 --> 5328.50]  Kinda breaks the vibe.
[5328.50 --> 5330.50]  Anyway, ah, so it'll go to producer Dan.
[5330.50 --> 5334.50]  Dan who will reply to it or send it to someone to help answer your question.
[5334.50 --> 5338.50]  Or we'll even curate it for me and Luke.
[5338.50 --> 5342.50]  So Dan, do you wanna hit us with a couple merch messages to show the folks how it works?
[5342.50 --> 5345.50]  I'm not entirely sure I have any tonight.
[5345.50 --> 5346.50]  None.
[5346.50 --> 5347.50]  Really?
[5347.50 --> 5352.50]  This is what happens when I don't mention the merch for the first hour of the show.
[5352.50 --> 5355.50]  Alright, why don't we jump into another topic then, shall we?
[5355.50 --> 5357.50]  Yeah, I'd jump into another topic.
[5357.50 --> 5359.50]  Something might have failed on the back end.
[5359.50 --> 5361.50]  Should we talk about something really cool?
[5361.50 --> 5362.50]  Yeah.
[5362.50 --> 5364.50]  Let's talk about German courts getting it right.
[5364.50 --> 5365.50]  Yeah.
[5365.50 --> 5366.50]  This is awesome.
[5366.50 --> 5367.50]  Do you wanna read a topic for a change?
[5367.50 --> 5368.50]  Sure.
[5370.50 --> 5371.50]  Uh, I gotta find it first.
[5371.50 --> 5372.50]  Give me one sec.
[5372.50 --> 5373.50]  Uh oh.
[5373.50 --> 5374.50]  Our merch message is broken.
[5374.50 --> 5375.50]  Is that what you've been tappity tapping at?
[5375.50 --> 5378.50]  Uh, no, I've been tappity tapping at a lot of other things.
[5378.50 --> 5379.50]  I got it.
[5379.50 --> 5380.50]  We're back on now.
[5380.50 --> 5381.50]  All good.
[5381.50 --> 5382.50]  Oh.
[5382.50 --> 5383.50]  Everything okay?
[5383.50 --> 5384.50]  No.
[5384.50 --> 5393.50]  Uh, a district court in Cologne has ordered Netflix to reimburse a customer 200 euros for
[5393.50 --> 5397.50]  failing to get the customer's consent for subscription price increases.
[5397.50 --> 5403.50]  Netflix increased its prices by over 50% between December 2017 and May of 2022.
[5403.50 --> 5409.50]  The price increases themselves were not condemned by the court, rather the lack of informed consent.
[5409.50 --> 5410.50]  That's the particular issue.
[5410.50 --> 5416.50]  A ruling from the Berlin Regional Court in 2021 found a provision in Netflix's user agreement
[5416.50 --> 5421.50]  that granted the company the right to increase prices at will and without the subscribers agreement
[5421.50 --> 5424.50]  was unfair and thus invalid.
[5424.50 --> 5425.50]  A higher, yeah.
[5425.50 --> 5433.50]  Uh, everything you sign is not technically binding if it's just BS, which is weird but probably good.
[5433.50 --> 5435.50]  Uh, because nobody reads that stuff anyways.
[5435.50 --> 5438.50]  Uh, a higher court upheld this ruling two years later.
[5438.50 --> 5444.50]  While Netflix has presented German users with a dialogue, uh, dialogue box, I guess, to agree
[5444.50 --> 5449.50]  to more recent price increases, it appears that this may not actually track.
[5449.50 --> 5451.50]  That they may not actually track it.
[5451.50 --> 5456.50]  And just assume that the user agreed if they don't unsubscribe from the service.
[5456.50 --> 5457.50]  Whoa.
[5457.50 --> 5462.50]  This means that if you didn't use Netflix for a couple months or your kid clicked through
[5462.50 --> 5465.50]  the dialogue on your account and you never saw it, you'll be billed at the increased rate
[5465.50 --> 5466.50]  without consent.
[5466.50 --> 5467.50]  Yeah.
[5467.50 --> 5468.50]  Interesting.
[5468.50 --> 5470.50]  And that's very common.
[5470.50 --> 5471.50]  Just to be clear.
[5471.50 --> 5474.50]  Not necessarily the kid thing, I don't know about that, it might be, but the, uh,
[5474.50 --> 5475.50]  Oh my god, dude.
[5475.50 --> 5479.50]  The people just having accounts that they don't use is like huge.
[5479.50 --> 5480.50]  The kid thing is definitely a thing.
[5480.50 --> 5481.50]  I promise you.
[5481.50 --> 5482.50]  Yeah.
[5482.50 --> 5483.50]  I'm not surprised.
[5483.50 --> 5487.50]  Um, the case clears the way for other German users to file complaints and the Consumer
[5487.50 --> 5488.50]  Rights Magazine...
[5488.50 --> 5489.50]  Don't even try.
[5489.50 --> 5492.50]  ...stiftung warren test?
[5492.50 --> 5493.50]  You tried.
[5493.50 --> 5494.50]  Yeah.
[5494.50 --> 5495.50]  Butchered that.
[5495.50 --> 5498.50]  Well, okay, well, the entire comment section is just that now.
[5498.50 --> 5499.50]  That's better than other things that could be.
[5499.50 --> 5500.50]  Luke, are you not even German?
[5500.50 --> 5502.50]  With a last name like Lafreniere?
[5502.50 --> 5506.50]  I mean, we have a Nvidia box on screen, we might as well take some flack off.
[5506.50 --> 5507.50]  Yeah, that's, you know.
[5507.50 --> 5508.50]  Yeah.
[5508.50 --> 5509.50]  Yeah.
[5509.50 --> 5514.50]  Um, the, and I'm actually like just as German as I am French.
[5514.50 --> 5515.50]  Life is strange.
[5515.50 --> 5522.50]  Um, the, um, anyways, in a separate case, the Hanover Administrative Court has confirmed
[5522.50 --> 5523.50]  a judgment stating that cookie binners...
[5523.50 --> 5524.50]  Oh, hold on, hold on.
[5524.50 --> 5525.50]  Hold on, hold on.
[5525.50 --> 5526.50]  Let's talk about this first one first.
[5526.50 --> 5527.50]  Okay.
[5527.50 --> 5528.50]  This is sick.
[5528.50 --> 5529.50]  Yeah, it's great.
[5529.50 --> 5530.50]  This is awesome.
[5530.50 --> 5531.50]  Yeah.
[5531.50 --> 5532.50]  Yeah.
[5532.50 --> 5537.50]  It, why do you just get to unilaterally, and I do understand legally why you are allowed
[5537.50 --> 5542.50]  to unilaterally increase the price of a subscription service because technically every month is
[5542.50 --> 5544.50]  a new contract.
[5544.50 --> 5545.50]  So you can just, I don't know.
[5545.50 --> 5547.50]  Yeah, it's a new contract now.
[5547.50 --> 5550.50]  And so if you stay subscribed, you agree to the new contract.
[5550.50 --> 5556.50]  No, that shouldn't be how things work.
[5556.50 --> 5563.50]  And if you, if you want, if you want to negotiate a new contract, in my opinion, you should have
[5563.50 --> 5568.50]  to cancel everyone's contract and then sign them up again.
[5568.50 --> 5570.50]  You should have to go through the whole signup process again.
[5570.50 --> 5573.50]  I guarantee you if that was how it worked...
[5573.50 --> 5574.50]  Companies would stop doing that immediately.
[5574.50 --> 5577.50]  Companies would immediately not do this ever again.
[5577.50 --> 5579.50]  They would not raise prices.
[5579.50 --> 5585.50]  They would set a price that is actually sustainable, and then they would not touch it for the love
[5585.50 --> 5586.50]  of God, not touch it.
[5586.50 --> 5588.50]  And that doesn't mean that they can't increase pricing.
[5588.50 --> 5592.50]  They absolutely can, but it would be on future signups.
[5592.50 --> 5596.50]  So if you get grandfathered in at a low rate, if you get a low rate or you get a promotional rate
[5596.50 --> 5598.50]  or you get whatever, then that's it.
[5598.50 --> 5599.50]  Like you got it.
[5599.50 --> 5601.50]  That was the deal that you signed up for.
[5601.50 --> 5607.50]  If they changed the deal after, then that literally isn't the deal you signed up for.
[5607.50 --> 5609.50]  Quite literally.
[5609.50 --> 5615.50]  This is so validating because I feel like I've talked about this so many times.
[5615.50 --> 5618.50]  I freaking love it.
[5618.50 --> 5629.50]  Like there's immense lock-in from payment processors, but it's not even because it's that hard to, on a technical level, swap in and swap out payment processors.
[5629.50 --> 5635.50]  The problem is that all your legal payment agreements are in that other payment processor.
[5635.50 --> 5644.50]  And like Stripe talks about how they can handle migrations and stuff, but it's really not that clean.
[5644.50 --> 5648.50]  And you start actually talking about it and it's a lot more complicated and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5648.50 --> 5659.50]  And it's easier in some scenarios and blah, blah, blah, but there's things that different payment processors will do to try to increase this level of lock-in.
[5659.50 --> 5667.50]  And nobody really changes the payment processors pretty much ever if they have subscriptions because the chance that these people won't come back.
[5667.50 --> 5674.50]  Not just because they might have forgotten that they have the subscription because you're re-asking them if it's worth it.
[5674.50 --> 5675.50]  Friction.
[5675.50 --> 5679.50]  And just re-asking them if it's worth it, you will lose a ton of people.
[5679.50 --> 5680.50]  A ton.
[5681.50 --> 5682.50]  I love it.
[5682.50 --> 5683.50]  Love it.
[5683.50 --> 5686.50]  By the way, we did get a detail wrong in that VPN story last week, apparently.
[5686.50 --> 5687.50]  Sure.
[5687.50 --> 5695.50]  When they said they didn't acquire the existing like customers, they actually didn't acquire the monthly subscribers either.
[5695.50 --> 5696.50]  Oh, okay.
[5696.50 --> 5698.50]  So I'm a lot more okay with it.
[5698.50 --> 5705.50]  So they had a bunch of free people who were obfuscated in the P&L by the paying customers.
[5705.50 --> 5711.50]  And when they bought it, they didn't get the paying customers and weren't told about the free people.
[5711.50 --> 5717.50]  And the free deals were available through like third-party websites and stuff.
[5717.50 --> 5720.50]  So were like not obviously apparent.
[5720.50 --> 5722.50]  How did they get them at all?
[5722.50 --> 5723.50]  They should have had no users.
[5723.50 --> 5724.50]  Right.
[5724.50 --> 5725.50]  So...
[5725.50 --> 5726.50]  So...
[5738.50 --> 5739.50]  Hello?
[5739.50 --> 5740.50]  Oh.
[5740.50 --> 5741.50]  Hi Dan.
[5741.50 --> 5742.50]  Who's back?
[5742.50 --> 5743.50]  Who...
[5743.50 --> 5744.50]  Who dropped?
[5744.50 --> 5745.50]  Was it me?
[5745.50 --> 5746.50]  Or you?
[5746.50 --> 5747.50]  You, I think.
[5747.50 --> 5748.50]  Okay.
[5748.50 --> 5749.50]  Are we...
[5749.50 --> 5750.50]  Are we gonna come back?
[5750.50 --> 5751.50]  Yeah.
[5751.50 --> 5752.50]  There you are.
[5752.50 --> 5755.50]  Because if it was us that dropped, you would have kept streaming, right?
[5755.50 --> 5758.50]  I thought I kept streaming and just lost you guys.
[5758.50 --> 5759.50]  Okay.
[5759.50 --> 5760.50]  Cool.
[5760.50 --> 5761.50]  Oh no.
[5761.50 --> 5762.50]  How's it going?
[5762.50 --> 5763.50]  Are we back?
[5763.50 --> 5764.50]  Are we back?
[5764.50 --> 5765.50]  We're back.
[5765.50 --> 5766.50]  We're back.
[5766.50 --> 5767.50]  Okay, cool.
[5767.50 --> 5768.50]  That's pretty neat.
[5768.50 --> 5769.50]  Hey guys.
[5769.50 --> 5770.50]  Sup?
[5770.50 --> 5771.50]  Cool.
[5771.50 --> 5774.50]  So apparently the last thing they heard was zero users.
[5774.50 --> 5781.50]  So long story short, yeah, basically by cutting those people off who in their mind, they
[5781.50 --> 5786.50]  were doing a favor to by allowing them to continue to use this service they hadn't even acquired
[5786.50 --> 5787.50]  users for for free.
[5787.50 --> 5790.50]  They were like being bros.
[5790.50 --> 5794.50]  I don't like how any of this went down.
[5794.50 --> 5796.50]  The whole thing is like sucky.
[5796.50 --> 5799.50]  But that is more bad on the company that sold.
[5799.50 --> 5800.50]  Yes.
[5800.50 --> 5803.50]  Versus the company that actually acquired the VPN.
[5803.50 --> 5810.50]  And I, it adds some nuance to the situation that I felt we should definitely follow up on.
[5810.50 --> 5811.50]  Oh yeah, that's fair.
[5811.50 --> 5812.50]  Yeah.
[5812.50 --> 5813.50]  All right.
[5813.50 --> 5814.50]  Cool.
[5814.50 --> 5817.50]  This is unrelated to the topic, but if we want to correct things from last week, I have something
[5817.50 --> 5818.50]  to correct as well.
[5818.50 --> 5819.50]  Oh, what now?
[5819.50 --> 5821.50]  I had said this is important.
[5821.50 --> 5822.50]  Okay.
[5822.50 --> 5823.50]  Okay.
[5823.50 --> 5827.50]  Like I got, I got to come true with the audience here.
[5827.50 --> 5828.50]  Come true.
[5828.50 --> 5829.50]  Okay.
[5829.50 --> 5830.50]  Is that not a phrase?
[5830.50 --> 5831.50]  Is that not a saying?
[5831.50 --> 5833.50]  So why don't you correct that first?
[5833.50 --> 5834.50]  Is there something close to that?
[5834.50 --> 5838.50]  Um, uh, be real?
[5838.50 --> 5839.50]  Maybe that's it?
[5839.50 --> 5841.50]  Uh, come clean.
[5841.50 --> 5842.50]  Come clean.
[5842.50 --> 5843.50]  Come clean.
[5843.50 --> 5844.50]  That's the one.
[5844.50 --> 5845.50]  Yeah.
[5845.50 --> 5846.50]  I got to come clean with the audience here.
[5846.50 --> 5847.50]  That's not how that works.
[5847.50 --> 5849.50]  The cleanup is after.
[5852.50 --> 5853.50]  Anyways.
[5853.50 --> 5854.50]  I lied last week.
[5854.50 --> 5855.50]  Did you?
[5855.50 --> 5856.50]  Yep.
[5856.50 --> 5857.50]  Not intentionally.
[5857.50 --> 5858.50]  Well, that's not a lie.
[5858.50 --> 5859.50]  But I was wrong.
[5859.50 --> 5860.50]  Okay.
[5860.50 --> 5861.50]  I know.
[5861.50 --> 5862.50]  I was making fun.
[5862.50 --> 5863.50]  Dan, his doesn't know thing.
[5863.50 --> 5864.50]  Yeah.
[5864.50 --> 5867.50]  Uh, I said that I had a character in Final Fantasy 6.
[5867.50 --> 5868.50]  Oh.
[5868.50 --> 5869.50]  And I only thought I did.
[5869.50 --> 5870.50]  You thought you had a character.
[5870.50 --> 5871.50]  Because I've done some-
[5871.50 --> 5872.50]  So you don't have any characters?
[5872.50 --> 5873.50]  Are you high?
[5873.50 --> 5874.50]  The whole game is like that you have tons of characters.
[5874.50 --> 5875.50]  No, and I don't even remember their name because I renamed them.
[5875.50 --> 5876.50]  Tara.
[5876.50 --> 5877.50]  There we go.
[5877.50 --> 5878.50]  Tara Brannford.
[5878.50 --> 5879.50]  Yeah, sure.
[5879.50 --> 5880.50]  You-
[5880.50 --> 5881.50]  Imperial Magitech.
[5881.50 --> 5882.50]  When do they talk about last names?
[5882.50 --> 5883.50]  How do you know their last name?
[5883.50 --> 5884.50]  Why would I not?
[5884.50 --> 5885.50]  I don't think I've ever seen their last name.
[5885.50 --> 5886.50]  I don't think I've ever seen their last name.
[5886.50 --> 5887.50]  I don't think I've ever seen their last name.
[5887.50 --> 5888.50]  Why do you think it's called-
[5888.50 --> 5889.50]  In the whole game.
[5889.50 --> 5890.50]  In the whole game.
[5890.50 --> 5891.50]  Figaro Castle.
[5891.50 --> 5892.50]  Okay, yeah, sure.
[5892.50 --> 5893.50]  Fair.
[5893.50 --> 5894.50]  So what do you think Edgar's last name is, smart guy?
[5894.50 --> 5895.50]  But that's not-
[5895.50 --> 5896.50]  Branford's castle.
[5896.50 --> 5897.50]  I just-
[5897.50 --> 5899.50]  When did they talk about her last name?
[5899.50 --> 5900.50]  Pathetic.
[5900.50 --> 5917.50]  Okay, well I renamed some characters while I was playing.
[5917.50 --> 5919.50]  They literally don't.
[5919.50 --> 5921.50]  You just have to know the canon.
[5921.50 --> 5922.50]  Okay, sure.
[5922.50 --> 5926.44]  And it's like my favorite game of all time, so I just know things like this, yeah, don't
[5926.44 --> 5927.44]  worry about it.
[5927.44 --> 5928.44]  Okay, yeah, sure.
[5928.44 --> 5935.32]  renamed some characters so when he asked me if I had Tara I thought I did but I had a different
[5935.32 --> 5940.64]  character okay I did not have her yet so what character did you even have I don't
[5940.64 --> 5942.36]  Setzer or something
[5942.36 --> 5952.92]  how could you possibly I didn't know the names how could you possibly think the old Bushido guy
[5952.92 --> 5960.96]  with a mustache oh is named Tara that's not the old Bushido guy you're wrong about your own game
[5960.96 --> 5967.46]  the gambler sorry uh how could you possibly I only know that because that's one of the characters I
[5967.46 --> 5973.54]  didn't rename how could you possibly think the white-haired gambler dude is named Tara honestly
[5973.54 --> 5982.56]  I never ever had them in my party ever and I forgot anything about them at all and I had just gotten
[5982.56 --> 5987.52]  them but isn't the iconic opera scene and everything and like that what do you mean you just got it no
[5987.52 --> 5992.40]  you've got it in the world of balance oh no no I in the world of ruin I had just gotten them
[5992.40 --> 5998.22]  ah and I never had them in my party ever in world I can't believe I just brain farted
[5998.22 --> 6011.00]  look before the show started okay I had to go back to my room to get my headphones I literally went up
[6011.00 --> 6016.52]  instead of down and then literally didn't realize it and tried my key card on someone else's room
[6016.52 --> 6022.88]  before I went oh my god I'm on completely the wrong floor just to give you some idea of where my brain
[6022.88 --> 6032.96]  is uh is it is that but yeah I have Tara now okay um are you sure yeah okay actually in the part hair white I
[6032.96 --> 6040.42]  I don't know uh how can you play how can you look at characters for this long and not know what they
[6040.42 --> 6045.06]  look like do you even are you even playing the game are you just having an AI do it I don't think it
[6045.06 --> 6051.54]  should count pink or something if he doesn't know what the main when you have her go trance it's
[6051.54 --> 6053.54]  definitely like white and pink
[6060.54 --> 6065.54]  okay anyway um I know the blitzes but I don't know the characters names or what they look like
[6067.86 --> 6075.54]  there you go okay I can like do the blitz inputs by memorization I love that I literally lend him a SNES
[6075.54 --> 6081.30]  controller to play this game so he could have the authentic experience and an adapter I play with
[6081.30 --> 6085.98]  and he went and he took his hand he went I know the blitzes and he used the arrow keys I played with
[6085.98 --> 6088.78]  the SNES controller at home a little bit I didn't want to take it traveling so I don't want to break
[6088.78 --> 6094.78]  it it doesn't matter that's cheap it doesn't matter okay you can also just not carry it that's fine you
[6094.78 --> 6101.78]  can just play with your keyboard like a pleb truthfully the first time I actually beat the game because I
[6101.78 --> 6107.18]  didn't beat it when I owned it as a kid I was a kid and I was too dumb and then I lost my Super
[6107.18 --> 6112.22]  Nintendo when I moved between my parents houses I didn't have it anymore and so the first time I
[6112.22 --> 6117.18]  actually beat the game was on that SNES on a computer so I 100% used to control a keyboard for
[6117.18 --> 6123.02]  that so yeah it's not that bad oh it's actually way easier to input the blitzes on a keyboard I could
[6123.02 --> 6128.66]  see that yeah yeah for whatever reason like the most powerful ones are incredibly easy though
[6128.66 --> 6133.90]  that's just like going a circle that's a remaster thing oh and they're they're much harder on the
[6133.90 --> 6139.52]  controller okay like I said they're they're really easy on a keyboard but one of them is literally
[6139.52 --> 6143.48]  just one way around the circle the other one's the other way around the circle yeah but if you if
[6143.48 --> 6148.04]  you get pressing it or no it's not the other way around the circle it's just the continuation of
[6148.04 --> 6153.92]  the circle if you get pressing it wrong like if you accidentally start at an angle instead it's
[6153.92 --> 6158.78]  a lot easier to screw up on like a d-pad that literally doesn't have diagonals right right
[6158.78 --> 6165.44]  because it's just across the pad so you have to like you have to nail it and you you will screw it
[6165.44 --> 6170.96]  up for I have I have been annihilated because I like kind of screwed up a blitz input but the remaster
[6170.96 --> 6178.52]  really screws up a lot of the balance of the original game like the the sword techs or whatever
[6178.52 --> 6185.06]  Bushido abilities they were called sword tech that wasn't a brain fart on the original the Bushido
[6185.06 --> 6190.34]  abilities you can just use anyone you want now it's like you had to wait before so if you were playing
[6190.34 --> 6195.98]  in the active battle mode you'd be like getting hit while you waited for him to like queue up quadra slice
[6195.98 --> 6203.00]  oh yeah silly and never really run him anyways I he sucks the the weird thing for me right now is I have
[6203.00 --> 6213.60]  way harder of a time with like the random encounters that I do with bosses I wipe bosses like no problem
[6213.60 --> 6223.50]  often like two three turns in done took very little damage if nothing and then I'll just die to random
[6223.50 --> 6230.48]  encounters by getting like one shot out of nowhere like first move random encounter characters dead
[6230.48 --> 6239.74]  huh what and this is like happened multiple times have you considered that you may be a bad gamer I
[6239.74 --> 6246.86]  have I've I've never lost to a boss in the game so far okay I have party wiped multiple times
[6246.86 --> 6253.88]  to just like random encounter trash which is so annoying because it's less likely that I saved recently
[6253.88 --> 6263.06]  wild oh all right why don't we talk about the other cool thing in a separate case the Hanover
[6263.06 --> 6269.18]  administrative court has confirmed a judgment stating that cookie banners must not be designed
[6269.18 --> 6276.02]  to encourage users to consent and that website operators must offer a clearly visible reject all
[6276.02 --> 6283.22]  button on the first level of cookie consent banners if the banner includes an accept all button that's
[6283.22 --> 6288.80]  huge for me that I love that cool the judgment came after lower saxone's data protection officer
[6288.80 --> 6292.82]  demanded a redesign of a media company's cookie banner because it didn't obtain effective informed
[6292.82 --> 6297.14]  and voluntary consent before setting cookies and processing personal information the company
[6297.14 --> 6301.40]  disagreed and claimed that the data protection authority was not responsible for monitoring legal
[6301.40 --> 6305.76]  provisions concerning cookies the court found that rejecting cookies on the banner in question was
[6305.76 --> 6309.22]  much more complicated than accepting them and that the banner used misleading wording such as
[6309.22 --> 6314.44]  optimal user experience and accepting clothes while the term consent was completely missing
[6314.44 --> 6324.04]  that's super cool that's just awesome um because like sometimes oh man there are so many bad
[6324.04 --> 6328.00]  cookies sometimes there are cookies that do enhance website experiences maybe we would be
[6328.00 --> 6335.28]  no go ahead almost never do I care though and I just reject everything but it's still but it's still
[6335.28 --> 6340.24]  this is so I love it yeah that's great I hate that it's only gonna be in Germany
[6340.24 --> 6346.10]  yeah yeah but hopefully you know these types of things hopefully they bleed out over time yeah I
[6346.10 --> 6354.00]  hope so I mean Apple is certainly doing absolutely everything in their power to slow roll any of the
[6354.00 --> 6358.16]  the antitrust and regulatory stuff that's hit them over the last little bit man
[6358.16 --> 6366.08]  uh Fortnite is back on the App Store and it's pretty crazy our discussion question for this topic is
[6366.08 --> 6374.42]  is Apple the most childish corporation on the planet or does that award go to someone else because wow have
[6374.42 --> 6382.28]  they ever engaged in some like peak level malicious compliance over this whole third-party payment processors
[6382.28 --> 6387.44]  on the App Store thing it's almost like the only reason they ever cared about any of it was so that they
[6387.44 --> 6393.92]  wouldn't have to compete and they could take their enormous cut acting as the sole monopolistic
[6393.92 --> 6398.84]  payment processor on this platform I feel like there's gotta be worse ones this is just the one
[6398.84 --> 6403.94]  that's like most in our orbit it's just hilarious yeah after Apple lost the court case regarding in-app
[6403.94 --> 6411.26]  third-party purchases Epic submitted Fortnite for approval to the App Store Apple this is so funny
[6411.26 --> 6417.74]  this is so Apple too oh man Apple refused to either accept or decline the application
[6417.74 --> 6424.76]  leaving it in limbo because if they declined it well then you know they'd get in trouble but like I
[6424.76 --> 6431.48]  don't know do we have to accept it I mean we're like we're looking at it I don't know
[6431.48 --> 6445.64]  it seems like it seems like it wrote in an order that Apple has to accept or decline the application
[6445.64 --> 6451.10]  and this is a quote Apple is fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or
[6451.10 --> 6466.10]  hearing based Apple has since accepted the application and Fortnight is now back on the App Store huge for real though actually like super okay I feel like I always have to disclaim this right
[6466.10 --> 6480.92]  because not a fan of everything Tim Sweeney does all right but this genuinely benefits every oh this was massive developer yeah for iOS I'll also give them a shout I don't like
[6480.92 --> 6485.42]  Fortnite I think I've played it one time ever and did not enjoy it and never played it again I mean in fairness
[6485.42 --> 6492.98]  Fortnite changes a lot so you might like it more now I think they're doing probably less type stuff where you can make all kinds of new game modes and stuff
[6492.98 --> 6499.22]  look the point is either way the point is be open-minded okay try anything twice
[6499.22 --> 6510.04]  um it's it's currently number one in adventure games on the App Store and already has over 20,000 ratings and has been up for like
[6510.04 --> 6520.74]  days so clearly doing pretty well yeah Jemesh says yes Sweeney is doing this for the future of games which is like his company's future you know
[6520.74 --> 6530.98]  I think a lot of it is like personal vendetta we're just benefiting from it which is great it's a huge win for everyone yeah and realistically he's one of the few
[6530.98 --> 6548.98]  company leaders who has the money and not just the money but the absolute iron balls to do this yeah yeah because Apple is a vindictive company if you step out of line very Nvidia-esque they will never
[6548.98 --> 6555.22]  engage with you again to Nvidia's credit they actually do let bygones be bygones eventually
[6555.22 --> 6563.22]  they they we we were we were blackballed for two years over the hard run box thing yeah we'll see and we are officially on blackballed now
[6563.22 --> 6571.22]  I'm we could be blackballed again but I'm really wondering how much of it was just like clear the field before 5000 series comes out
[6571.22 --> 6577.46]  uh and then who cares after that no I think it was more a specific person who was ass hurt yeah
[6577.46 --> 6584.26]  yeah that's that's we'll see how things go in the next like six months yeah I'm reserving judgment until
[6585.38 --> 6585.62]  yeah
[6588.58 --> 6597.46]  there's been some bad that I don't even think is not super public yet it's not mine to release oh yeah oh no oh
[6597.46 --> 6607.54]  yeah like real bad more um uh okay why don't I talk about something good while he types that up
[6607.54 --> 6614.82]  steam os moves one step closer to a wider release with a new update valve has released steam os 3.7.8
[6614.82 --> 6620.98]  which comes with official support for third-party pc handhelds this is so cool so you could just go
[6620.98 --> 6628.26]  install it on your ally or your ianio or whatever um along with a bevy of other upgrades um this is
[6628.26 --> 6632.82]  the first version of the software to offer an official recovery image with explicit support for
[6632.82 --> 6639.86]  installation on devices with amd hardware okay so not just anything just yet and an nvme drive although
[6639.86 --> 6644.90]  valve does uh specify that it is targeted toward handheld devices and is not final so you can basically
[6644.90 --> 6650.42]  install it on like whatever as long as you've got amd hardware and an nvme drive there's also
[6650.42 --> 6657.30]  explicit installation instructions for the legion go and rog ally is it the year of the linux desktop
[6657.30 --> 6663.86]  actually though this time this is so cool um other upgrades include new mesa graphics driver's base
[6663.86 --> 6668.90]  uh bluetooth mic support in desktop mode still no gaming mode uh battery management tools and the
[6668.90 --> 6674.34]  ability to turn a steam deck uh turn on a steam deck via a bluetooth controller which was previously
[6674.34 --> 6679.94]  only possible on the oled so this is super cool if you have just like a steam machine in your living room
[6679.94 --> 6684.18]  remember when they used to call them steam machines uh so if you just have one as like a like a living
[6684.18 --> 6689.38]  room console you can just use your bluetooth controller to be like boop turn my steam ah i'm so excited
[6689.94 --> 6696.74]  i'm so excited and i'm excited for competition look at the way microsoft has allegedly woken up and is
[6696.74 --> 6703.86]  like you know allegedly partnering with asus on the ally 2 and you know trying to make windows a better like
[6703.86 --> 6711.22]  gaming platform like let's go competition it's always good yeah hell yeah literally competition
[6711.22 --> 6718.02]  is always better than not competition i think if there's a time that competition was worse i guess
[6718.02 --> 6726.26]  if you had like a super fragmented market and then like like okay i think there's a there's probably a
[6726.26 --> 6730.98]  middle between businesses there's a middle ground no no i'm even thinking businesses okay so so imagine a
[6730.98 --> 6737.86]  world okay you don't want there to be one bank or one insurance company because that's terrible because
[6737.86 --> 6745.78]  then there's no competition but you also don't want there to be 10 000 banks and 10 000 insurance
[6745.78 --> 6754.90]  companies because those will be very small companies and those types of institutions need scale in order to
[6754.90 --> 6762.18]  absorb the sometimes one large one-time losses that they can experience there's a middle ground i think
[6762.18 --> 6768.18]  there's some debate there on the bank side of things no dude when you have like a thousand tiny banks it's
[6768.18 --> 6774.74]  much easier for there to be a bank run because it can be in like a very localized when you have omega banks
[6774.74 --> 6781.06]  well that's no this is bad they cause recessions due to bad practices yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm saying i'm
[6781.06 --> 6787.86]  saying that more is not always better sure but you're not saying that infinite competition of
[6787.86 --> 6791.54]  infinite parties is good you're saying that competition is always good is that what i said
[6791.54 --> 6795.54]  i don't remember my exact wording you said competition is always good i said it's always better
[6795.54 --> 6800.90]  yeah but that doesn't have to mean that there are thousands and thousands of players competing sure
[6800.90 --> 6807.62]  i'm just saying there's a middle ground of like like like peak competition goodness that's all i'm
[6807.62 --> 6811.94]  saying i think we do this as a company i know i do this so i'm not trying to exclude myself
[6812.66 --> 6817.38]  i think sometimes we're like we get and this is why i say i don't know all the time so i'm 100
[6817.38 --> 6822.50]  on board with this we're so worried about people just taking crap that we say and twisting it right
[6822.50 --> 6827.54]  we run around in so many circles that we end up losing the plot part way through
[6827.54 --> 6837.78]  oh man we're just saying black and red's a cool color combination that's all that's all we we like
[6837.78 --> 6843.38]  it for gaming pcs who made their uniforms aren't they like still around hugo boss yeah i think and
[6843.38 --> 6850.82]  super famous i don't want to get that wrong i don't want to get very fashionable uh nazi uniforms i
[6850.82 --> 6862.10]  think it was hugo boss um yes hugo boss apologized for nazi past uh yeah okay okay yep there he goes
[6862.10 --> 6867.86]  yeah so hugo hugo boss by the way uh
[6867.86 --> 6883.46]  really yeah i saw it like there's no belief here i saw it he showed me
[6885.46 --> 6891.06]  all right he's gonna deal with it in his own way or whatever so how can they be actually that stupid
[6891.06 --> 6896.58]  yeah i think is the question but this is my like so i don't know man we'll see we'll see over the next
[6896.58 --> 6902.90]  while when i was digging up all the times that we've criticized nvidia in the past um i came across
[6902.90 --> 6914.26]  some stuff that i had forgotten about um and one of them was the an lmg clip where i um i basically came
[6914.26 --> 6925.06]  out and i was like i no longer believe they are playing 4d chess i believe they're idiots um
[6926.58 --> 6938.50]  past linus smart guy i beard i saw that and yeah i saw that and genuinely like kind of laughed
[6938.50 --> 6945.62]  because it was just so dumb yeah yeah and it yeah yeah
[6945.62 --> 6959.78]  and like the timing of it it's terrible holy dude um hey more goodies though yeah remember that naz
[6959.78 --> 6966.98]  company that i invested in yeah remember yeah remember how people were like hating on the launch
[6966.98 --> 6971.46]  and the comments were all like this is pointless no one would ever buy this if you're excited about
[6971.46 --> 6976.42]  this you should feel bad remember how they had a really really great launch and lots of people
[6976.42 --> 6981.54]  gave them a bunch of money want to hear one of the cool things that they are already doing with that
[6981.54 --> 6991.06]  money yeah zfs any raid sponsored by eshtec so that's the the naz company that i made the uh small
[6991.06 --> 7000.82]  investment in um this is so cool earlier this week dude i've i have wanted to talk about this so hard
[7000.82 --> 7007.14]  because i have known for a while uh because they basically immediately when they're when their
[7007.14 --> 7013.86]  first couple days of sales were bonkers they were like oh my god let's do something there's opportunity
[7013.86 --> 7020.58]  now there's stuff that we had on the road map for like like the future that we could just immediately
[7020.58 --> 7026.58]  start fixing because there's these projects that are just like super cool but just not funded so people
[7026.58 --> 7032.42]  can't work on them and we could just we could just do this cool stuff dude oh i've wanted to talk
[7032.42 --> 7038.34]  about this basically since they are freaked they freaking went out from cover whatever whatever blue
[7038.34 --> 7044.26]  cover whatever it's called when like uh the when the when like a startup stops being stealth unstealth
[7044.26 --> 7049.94]  mode whatever there's a term for it doesn't matter yeah the point is earlier this week eshtec the
[7049.94 --> 7058.74]  creators of hex os investment disclosure introduced to the world zfs any raid developed by clara inc sponsored
[7058.74 --> 7069.22]  by eshtec zfs any raid will introduce two new pool layouts any raid mirror and any raid z1 any raid
[7069.22 --> 7075.62]  mirror will be available first and will ensure that all data will be written to two different discs in
[7075.62 --> 7082.66]  pools of more than two discs of differing sizes so um this is a little bit out of order but the point is
[7082.66 --> 7091.54]  you can raid discs in zfs so so so raid z not like hardware raid like software raid z like zfs so you can
[7091.54 --> 7098.58]  you can create pools with differing discs and you were always able to do that but there would be a huge
[7098.58 --> 7105.14]  loss in total capacity uh you would basically go lowest common denominator so if i had
[7105.62 --> 7114.42]  a 10 terabyte drive and a two terabyte drive and i raid um z1'd them or whatever whatever no i think
[7114.42 --> 7118.66]  technically raid z1 is not a mirror even though it like kind of operates like a mirror if you just have
[7118.66 --> 7123.38]  two drives don't worry about it the point is if i used them i would get a total of four terabytes of
[7123.38 --> 7130.50]  usable capacity out of my 12 terabytes that's not a great experience no so um
[7130.50 --> 7137.86]  um any raid z1 will take the same concept and fee and features as zfs raid z1 so where you can lose
[7137.86 --> 7144.82]  any one drive and it will add support for mixed drive sizes uh this is so cool so how much space can we
[7144.82 --> 7152.42]  gain here's some examples okay we have a pool with a four terabyte drive a six terabyte drive and an eight
[7152.42 --> 7160.50]  eight terabyte drive okay so we are this is some this is some mix and match here all right okay check this
[7160.50 --> 7170.10]  out oh wait i can't screen share dan dan can you show them the table on it so in a in mirror so this is a
[7170.10 --> 7177.30]  traditional mirror i can't see that any in a traditional mirror uh we would get 10 terabytes
[7177.30 --> 7186.02]  only out of our total what is this 12 plus 8 20 out of our 24 terabytes that is that is an awful
[7186.02 --> 7191.30]  amount of storage to give up to parity okay in new any raid mirror
[7193.30 --> 7200.18]  we get 12 terabytes okay that's not a lot more but if you can see on our table that dan maybe has on
[7200.18 --> 7205.94]  the thing i can't tell you can see on our table that if we add a four terabyte drive we actually get
[7205.94 --> 7212.66]  half of the capacity whereas with the old mirror there would be no change okay so a little bit
[7212.66 --> 7220.98]  exciting here's where things get really cool in raid z1 versus any raid z1 our pool capacity goes from
[7220.98 --> 7229.62]  literally half okay 12 terabytes to 16 terabytes out of our initial 24 and then if we add four terabytes
[7229.62 --> 7235.14]  we get two and a half terabytes instead of okay actually that works out a little bit better on the
[7235.14 --> 7241.94]  one the point is more the point is more when is it coming eshtex says they won't even say soon
[7241.94 --> 7248.18]  but they will keep the community updated as the project progresses and hits key milestones i am i am
[7248.18 --> 7258.66]  pretty i am pretty excited um getting more of your use generally very cool out of mishmash of drives is a
[7258.66 --> 7265.54]  very consumer friendly feature that has pretty much no benefit whatsoever to enterprise customers who
[7265.54 --> 7270.50]  are just always using matching drives which is why this has never been worked on and just like how a
[7270.50 --> 7275.94]  lot of people were like oh like as a home lab enthusiast this isn't necessarily something that i would want
[7275.94 --> 7283.14]  sure um cool this caters to not necessarily home lab enthusiasts as well where it's like this is just what
[7283.14 --> 7288.74]  i've got and i want to make something out of it yeah so this is in my opinion this is a very like
[7290.74 --> 7296.66]  informed thing for them to back early super i think it makes a lot of sense super cool it's for
[7296.66 --> 7303.06]  people who are just you know building their first jellyfin server yeah who are who are who are
[7303.06 --> 7308.10]  who are got some old desktops that yeah have been in the garage for a few years that have some drives in
[7308.10 --> 7314.74]  it let me throw these in here and do what i can super excited for this and i'm super excited to see
[7314.74 --> 7323.38]  them taking that initial money that they got from their uh from their like alpha you know hey trust us
[7323.38 --> 7330.26]  we're gonna do cool stuff with this uh uh like launch and then actually doing cool stuff with it just
[7330.26 --> 7336.90]  because i'm starting to see this already no we are not saying that nothing else can do this no but zfs
[7338.66 --> 7345.46]  this was not a feature of zfs and so that's what's really exciting is you get all the zfs goodness
[7345.46 --> 7354.90]  but also mix and match it's just awesome awesome yes i know drobo existed ages ago that's not the point
[7354.90 --> 7364.26]  the point is and there's yeah other ones zfs one thing we have until your cutoff that you defined 18 minutes
[7364.26 --> 7372.02]  we have until your face 18 i'm good whenever i'm already checked out of the hotel um nerd yeah
[7374.26 --> 7379.38]  i hand i was on top we can go a little longer we'll go a little longer all right i will we'll do our
[7379.38 --> 7383.70]  best okay we'll do our best we always do our best hey do you want to do you want to go through the um
[7383.70 --> 7389.38]  the the computex roundup from someone not computex apparently it's supposed to be wacky stuff so dan do you
[7389.38 --> 7394.34]  want to just like pop them up on screen and sync with us we'll go through an order uh yeah depends
[7394.34 --> 7398.66]  how fast you are the doc in all right so i'm going to click the first one
[7401.14 --> 7407.94]  it's a pulsar x noctua mouse okay a hundred percent i saw this and just thought someone was trolling with
[7407.94 --> 7415.94]  like ai models i didn't think this was real oh yeah what i saw it in person it's real are they actually
[7415.94 --> 7423.70]  like sell these or was it what part of real do you not understand sir that thermal take oil case thing
[7423.70 --> 7429.14]  yeah they've had a different dramatically different iteration of it every year i don't know if that's
[7429.14 --> 7435.22]  ever going to be for sale it's i love going and seeing what they're currently doing i don't know if
[7435.22 --> 7443.22]  they're ever going to sell it we'll see it weighs about 20 grams more than the the regular um
[7443.22 --> 7451.06]  um i forget what model of mouse this is uh fine man or something like that hold on uh yeah the
[7451.06 --> 7457.62]  fine men mouse um the the weight distribution felt a little different to me as well it's got the fan
[7457.62 --> 7462.90]  it's got a fan in it right yeah yeah yeah so it's probably yeah feel a little bit i definitely had some
[7462.90 --> 7468.42]  ideas for a v2 right now the fan is just on and i was like oh it'd be kind of cool if it had like a
[7468.42 --> 7475.06]  moisture sensor so that it only turns on if your hands are actually sweaty um because sometimes
[7475.06 --> 7479.86]  i'm a pretty warm boy but other times you know in the middle of the night in particular i get to
[7479.86 --> 7485.70]  be a pretty cold boy can you have pwm it basically you know those like um the the single button that
[7485.70 --> 7490.90]  just cycles through mouse sensitivities uh it it may be controllable i'm not sure actually look
[7490.90 --> 7498.26]  it is controllable okay so it's controllable but it's always on yeah yeah uh anyway it's it's pretty
[7498.26 --> 7503.78]  cool it's pretty light it's like 60 something grams it's not bad yeah yeah yeah yeah pretty cool okay
[7503.78 --> 7515.38]  next up mm-hmm 3000 watt psus more than one brand was showing off power supplies that were 3000 watts or more
[7515.38 --> 7525.70]  basically ai all right let's move on um in when unveiled whatever this is yeah they say this case
[7525.70 --> 7534.26]  is trophy inspired it is over a meter tall and will support full-size 50 series gpus i should certainly
[7534.82 --> 7544.34]  hope so imagine it didn't yep in wind back with another signature case they do that they do that and
[7544.34 --> 7552.10]  um apparently it weighs like 40 kilos or something like that nice i don't i don't remember the number
[7552.10 --> 7557.78]  don't quote me on that but apparently it weighs a lot i was talking to someone from our team who saw this
[7557.78 --> 7567.86]  in person i didn't actually catch this uh short circuit the thermal rate frozen creator okay okay this
[7567.86 --> 7580.26]  actually looks extremely legit dude amd strix halo is i swear the coolest cpu in the last
[7581.22 --> 7587.22]  i don't know 10 years i i can't i can't think of anything cooler in that time frame yeah uh i get
[7587.22 --> 7593.86]  apples and silicon is really cool but like in the pc space on the pc side dude i interpreted it that way it
[7593.86 --> 7600.82]  is so cool like that is a gaming pc in alex's hands that is capable of like playing black myth wukong
[7600.82 --> 7608.42]  yeah and the fact that thermal right is getting into pcs i mean obviously they know the cooling for pcs
[7608.42 --> 7617.06]  so like why not but this looks awesome uh oh i i don't know i guess investment disclosure since
[7617.06 --> 7622.66]  framework also makes a strict halo thing oh okay but like oh that's sure okay i don't know the right way
[7622.66 --> 7626.74]  to handle this because that seems dumb like why am i bringing up framework if all i'm saying is that
[7626.74 --> 7632.34]  something else looks awesome no it's good well yeah it's good for framework but is that actually good
[7632.34 --> 7638.50]  for the audience i'm not a hundred percent sure probably not but it's good for framework and it's the law
[7640.18 --> 7640.58]  got him
[7643.86 --> 7649.86]  i love it you legally have to advertise your framework i think that's hilarious i genuinely think that's very
[7649.86 --> 7667.14]  funny like i i i that is thoroughly entertaining to me um in other news hey do you need a monitor on your cpu
[7667.14 --> 7675.54]  cooler um because there's a lot of them wait is this real the first one the first one's not real i don't
[7675.54 --> 7684.58]  right so it looks like a tablet uh for is this real is the zygmatech one real do you know dan
[7685.70 --> 7692.90]  no idea it slots into the zygmatech pump by sliding into what looks like an alien's shoulder socket
[7693.54 --> 7702.02]  okay apparently it's real uh i did not catch this that is wow that boy that is something um that makes
[7702.02 --> 7712.26]  cooler masters and thermal takes look downright reasonable um lee and lee also has a curved display
[7712.26 --> 7716.02]  on their ai o check this out i don't
[7719.06 --> 7727.38]  hey sequel to the all-screen pc let's go i guess i i just i think the yeah i don't know i don't want to be
[7727.38 --> 7730.82]  i don't want to be too negative after spending a significant part of the show talking about how
[7730.82 --> 7736.74]  we need to be more positive but stuff like that makes me feel like we're running out of ideas i mean
[7738.34 --> 7743.54]  maybe it's just not for me didn't all of computex kind of feel like we're running out of ideas it sure
[7743.54 --> 7753.14]  did it was a this was noctwiz booth was super cool um their evaporative thermosyphon cooler um
[7753.14 --> 7759.30]  um if it performs anywhere near like what they think they can achieve it will be a remarkable piece
[7759.30 --> 7767.46]  of kit um at a astronomical price probably um so like there's some innovation there um
[7772.34 --> 7774.66]  seasonic i liked
[7774.66 --> 7781.46]  like but like basically they're just like fixing someone else's problem you know so
[7782.74 --> 7789.14]  it's hard to get excited about that uh oh this card no one can afford won't blow up anymore if i add
[7789.14 --> 7798.74]  this thing that isn't out yet yeah um cool asus has an ergonomic keyboard with a split in the middle
[7798.74 --> 7805.14]  okay that is not an ergonomic keyboard that is just a keyboard that separates in the middle
[7805.78 --> 7810.90]  but i think people do still categorize that as ergonomic really because of your shoulder rotation
[7811.70 --> 7817.22]  okay yeah all right so it's not ergonomic in all ways but it's ergonomic for your shoulder rotation
[7817.22 --> 7821.94]  uh keyboards like this have existed for a long time there was many of them at the show
[7821.94 --> 7828.66]  i'll allow it um the silverstone retro case is legitimately cool okay this was actually cool
[7828.66 --> 7835.22]  but it's not a new idea that's for sure specifically an old one it looks sick though uh
[7836.42 --> 7844.42]  i i genuinely really like it yeah and unlike the first gen one it gave more thought to like cooling
[7844.42 --> 7850.02]  and putting modern hardware in it and so yeah like you can you can really put a top of the line
[7850.02 --> 7855.94]  gaming machine in this and build a sleeper without doing any of the actual like fabrication work
[7855.94 --> 7862.74]  of building a sleeper this looks amazing i wonder if this would be a theft deterrent like if you
[7862.74 --> 7870.42]  did up if you like did up your setup like retro style and put like like if you like 3d printed like a
[7870.42 --> 7878.18]  bigger bezel on your monitor and like used uh used like like beige keycaps on like a sick mechanical
[7878.18 --> 7884.50]  keyboard and like like if you did it up would anybody steal it that okay hold on a second
[7885.06 --> 7891.94]  hold on a second could there be a way for us to like social experiment this can you like you know
[7891.94 --> 7897.54]  how like bait cars they can kind of like bait people into trying to steal them bait a whole computer bait
[7897.54 --> 7903.46]  a house because someone would have to like go into it oh and then we have to like see if they take the
[7903.46 --> 7912.82]  computer work with mark rover like is that a thing there's got to be youtube channel that like does
[7912.82 --> 7920.90]  this well mark rover did the porch pirate thing for years well yeah that's porch pirating though no i
[7920.90 --> 7925.46]  mean not every porch pirate is just gonna like way significantly more common yeah
[7925.46 --> 7934.50]  i have no idea i think baiting someone to break into a house is probably pretty hard to predict
[7934.50 --> 7938.66]  gilmore d in floatplane chat says whoever did that bait would be a master
[7941.46 --> 7949.54]  all right on that note we can move on um pc world scented thermal paste our question from the writer is
[7949.54 --> 7959.94]  would elijah eat this yeah uh i feel like if you paid him like 20 bucks i think you'd send it
[7960.50 --> 7968.42]  scented thermal paste wow uh we're definitely not out of ideas we've we've started scenting thermal paste
[7968.42 --> 7978.02]  yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna close that topic um cool we've got a announcement it's not it's not like
[7978.66 --> 7984.82]  innovation is impossible this isn't new but like we saw fractal go with those the the like wooden
[7984.82 --> 7989.46]  and that dramatically changed the case industry yeah yeah that new antac like it's there there is
[7989.46 --> 7994.50]  still the new antac case is interesting like there's there is stuff that people can do i meant it has
[7994.50 --> 8003.30]  wood like the fractal one oh i thought you meant the did they do a collab yeah they did it has wood on it
[8003.30 --> 8010.98]  oh it does yeah because like you know trends yeah uh this week on float plane we've got a ton
[8010.98 --> 8016.10]  of behind the scenes from our time at computex and some more firetruck slash april fools behind
[8016.10 --> 8020.98]  the scenes as well with a new why is wan late episode uh we're supposed to watch the clip so i
[8020.98 --> 8026.82]  guess i'll click on it now dan i can't really show a floating clip because i have to log in and things like
[8026.82 --> 8032.10]  that you can't show a float plane clip you'd have to log in well i think the question dan that is on
[8032.10 --> 8038.50]  all of our minds is why are you not logged into float plane yeah don't you care yeah okay let me just
[8038.50 --> 8044.26]  download it and then add it to the streaming software so that i can show it for four seconds
[8045.94 --> 8053.46]  nice i i can't tell if his voice was coming through to them but if it wasn't uh it was loaded with
[8053.46 --> 8058.66]  passive aggression oh no wait the plane's actually really fast so that took like no time at all
[8060.10 --> 8064.98]  nice good job luke all right here here you go uh what is it this button
[8066.58 --> 8070.18]  and i do what i'm doing shut up
[8070.18 --> 8079.54]  you got zero oh i got zero
[8086.50 --> 8092.58]  i love that it works yeah that's so cool that's pretty cool uh we will also have secret shopper
[8092.58 --> 8098.74]  part four the finale which will be available next week up early on float plane so go check it out

[8230.42 --> 8235.38]  but brown like again people buy brown shorts because they look inoffensive i don't know if they buy
[8235.38 --> 8238.82]  brown shorts because brown minecraft block is a cool aesthetic
[8238.82 --> 8243.22]  black

[8247.14 --> 8250.02]  slimming you know it's slimming
[8251.70 --> 8256.74]  you gotta wear the brown pants and a green shirt uh just embrace it sure dan uh
[8258.50 --> 8263.22]  hey taiwan show what's the best non-ai tech you spotted at computex this year
[8263.22 --> 8268.38]  uh p.s linus have you learned nothing from the last time you played with gold
[8269.14 --> 8275.70]  also i'm charged shipping on gift cards now hey the la the last time i played with gold
[8275.70 --> 8282.10]  the controller appreciated a lot that ended up being a tremendous investment pun intended
[8283.06 --> 8290.98]  get it yep nice i don't think i saw anything on the show floor that said it was ai enabled that i was
[8290.98 --> 8298.50]  excited about at all one funny thing that i ran into though did you see the ai golf booth no there was a
[8298.50 --> 8304.26]  big ai golf booth i haven't talked to any i i've talked to a bunch of people that saw it i haven't
[8304.26 --> 8309.06]  talked to a single person that saw it work um i saw them working on it for a pretty considerable
[8309.06 --> 8311.78]  amount of time we were standing there with sammy trying to wait to see if they're going to get it
[8311.78 --> 8316.42]  working and then they they claimed they got it working they had someone go up to like test it and
[8316.42 --> 8321.86]  they they they took a really long time trying to get the golf ball and the tee they finally got it
[8321.86 --> 8327.54]  they whiffed hard took a really long time to set it up like they missed the screen they hit the
[8327.54 --> 8332.58]  the ball but they missed the whole screen which is like almost everywhere the ball could have gone
[8332.58 --> 8341.14]  um they took a really long time setting it up on the tee again hit it again whiffed the screen again
[8342.18 --> 8347.46]  and then the system stopped working again and we just laughed
[8349.86 --> 8355.86]  that kind of encapsulated a lot of the ai enabledness that at least i saw at the show but i was only on the
[8355.86 --> 8367.54]  show floor for one day so maybe maybe you saw something i doubt it but maybe um boy my my favorite
[8367.54 --> 8377.78]  thing is probably um i'm gonna go with the boiling cooler i i like i like cool i like cool cooling stuff
[8377.78 --> 8385.22]  it was ai enabled no that wasn't ai enabled was what they asked oh yeah so i'm gonna go with i'm gonna
[8385.22 --> 8394.26]  go with the boiling cooler that looks sick nice um hey kind of related to ai uh signal is blocking
[8394.26 --> 8400.82]  windows recall microsoft's ai enabled constant logging of everything that you do on your computer
[8401.38 --> 8406.34]  signal messenger is warning users that the privacy of their communications is being threatened by
[8406.34 --> 8412.50]  windows recall microsoft's ai tool that will screenshot index and store pretty much everything a user does
[8412.50 --> 8418.82]  every few seconds they have updated signal for windows to by default block the ability of windows
[8418.82 --> 8425.22]  to screenshot the app signals move reduces the possibility of recall indexing indexing private
[8425.22 --> 8430.58]  messages but doesn't eliminate it because users can change the setting within the desktop app for
[8430.58 --> 8436.34]  example if they want to make use of accessibility tools like screen readers signal officials note that
[8436.34 --> 8440.90]  microsoft has made many adjustments to recall in response to critical feedback over the last year
[8440.90 --> 8446.18]  but recall still places any content displayed within privacy protected apps like signal at risk
[8446.90 --> 8456.10]  we've actually got a video coming up about recall we kind of totally on purpose have a laptop from back
[8456.10 --> 8463.06]  when recall was first announced that we did the like hacks ring to make it work even though it wasn't an ai
[8463.06 --> 8470.74]  enough laptop and uh we left it disconnected completely from the internet as a time capsule of
[8471.54 --> 8477.78]  windows recall when it was first launched and we take that out of the mothballs and a brand new
[8477.78 --> 8483.94]  signal a signal excuse me a windows recall laptop and show the differences in behavior how they how they
[8483.94 --> 8489.46]  log how it's encrypted or not encrypted and interesting it's a really cool video yeah that's cool that we
[8489.46 --> 8493.46]  totally on purpose definitely kept that laptop disconnected from the internet for a year
[8495.86 --> 8500.82]  nice happy accidents happy accident yeah no we just like a lot of recipes are made we were originally
[8500.82 --> 8506.26]  planning to make a video about recall and then microsoft bailed on the launch and so we were like
[8506.26 --> 8510.18]  okay well we can't really make this video so we just like they're not even releasing it yeah so it was
[8510.18 --> 8515.86]  like written yeah but we just like put everything away and so it ended up working out so we'll we'll do the
[8515.86 --> 8526.34]  video now our discussion question is is anyone excited about recall no really incredibly draconian it teams
[8526.34 --> 8534.02]  cool cool yeah but they already have tools like that so it's not even like microsoft's just reinventing
[8534.02 --> 8541.54]  the wheel from that perspective well maybe they could save money on their tools that they have that
[8541.54 --> 8550.66]  already do that because you're right man flow plane chat is hilarious any any excuse to mention that you use
[8550.66 --> 8557.38]  firefox every single full plane user uses firefox i know that i know that i know i know that this is
[8557.38 --> 8564.82]  this is just fact it's like it's a law of the universe yeah um even the ones that use chrome this is super
[8564.82 --> 8570.34]  cool they still use firefox coach a small french company sells a product called infinite battery which
[8570.34 --> 8576.18]  allows users to swap individual cells inside in order to have them the battery lasts longer the company
[8576.18 --> 8582.66]  explains that most e-bike batteries are made up of collections of 18 650 cells which are wired together
[8582.66 --> 8588.10]  in series and parallel and often an e-bike's battery will fail and stop working even if only a small
[8588.10 --> 8593.70]  handful of these individual cells stop working the product is a fireproof casing and some documentation
[8593.70 --> 8599.22]  that allows users to swap in fresh cells with only a screwdriver it also has a built-in battery monitoring
[8599.22 --> 8603.14]  and other stats that can be seen through your phone and is currently compatible without with about 90
[8603.14 --> 8612.66]  of existing e-bike brands this is super cool that's awesome yeah we did a video uh man this was years ago
[8612.66 --> 8621.38]  at this point where um the title is this should be illegal battery repair blocking and uh it was when i
[8621.38 --> 8631.30]  discovered that not only will brands not enable you to replace the cells in your battery pack but some of
[8631.30 --> 8639.30]  them will actively block you from doing it by detecting a change in voltage at the bms and then self-destructing
[8640.18 --> 8647.78]  if at any point that voltage goes outside of certain parameters and uh uh this was back uh when colin was
[8647.78 --> 8656.98]  working here he told me that apparently some of them are so so bad that not only will they self-destruct if it
[8656.98 --> 8666.18]  like goes to zero but they will self-destruct if you charge them and it's like it suspiciously charges
[8666.18 --> 8673.94]  like too much more better you must have changed the cells in here and they'll turn off just go to sleep
[8673.94 --> 8680.26]  forever oh that is brutal i still believe everything that i said back then that should be illegal and i think
[8680.26 --> 8686.66]  that this e-bike company sounds super cool yeah that's awesome there's some microsoft announcements
[8686.66 --> 8693.30]  from build 2025 microsoft has made their windows subsystem for linux lsx open source with the code up
[8693.30 --> 8700.42]  on github now lsx allows windows to natively run elf executables and implement linux syscalls inside
[8700.42 --> 8705.70]  the windows kernel very cool microsoft is also adding model context protocol support in windows 11 for tighter
[8705.70 --> 8710.42]  integration with ai all right from an official statement the mcp platform on windows will offer
[8710.42 --> 8714.26]  a standardized framework for ai agents to connect with native windows apps which can expose specific
[8714.26 --> 8720.26]  functionality to augment the skills and capabilities of those agents on windows 11 pcs okay and finally
[8720.26 --> 8725.78]  microsoft has announced the newest web syndication standards nlweb designed to make it easier for ai to
[8725.78 --> 8732.18]  crawl the internet and add tighter ai integration into web pages cool hooray
[8732.18 --> 8742.98]  and in other hooray news open ai buys one of joanie ives companies io for six and a half billion
[8742.98 --> 8748.82]  dollars oh good i am happy they had that much money i was reading an article about this acquisition
[8749.78 --> 8760.18]  that um highlighted products that uh the the ex design chief at apple um was working on with his
[8760.18 --> 8767.06]  like love from or io company like whatever whatever it is that he's doing sure and and one of i think
[8767.70 --> 8774.50]  two projects that they highlighted was that he's designing his company's headquarters
[8776.26 --> 8784.18]  and i was like okay like right but isn't that just like like a necessary thing that because people need
[8784.18 --> 8792.26]  a place to sit like what do you actually what do you actually do i i'm actually i'm 100 not sure and
[8792.26 --> 8799.54]  maybe i'm missing something here but i i haven't seen anything that love from or io have done that are worth
[8800.10 --> 8812.34]  six and a half billion dollars like can we can we contextualize this at all um like this must be
[8812.34 --> 8819.86]  this must be this must be a game changer like absolute game changer can you guys can you guys let me know
[8819.86 --> 8828.34]  like what love from or and or io have done to be worth six and a half bees apparently sam altman has been
[8828.34 --> 8835.70]  working with johnny ive already on some like i'm assuming ai enabled smart wearable necklace thing
[8835.70 --> 8841.38]  uh because apparently we didn't learn anything from the ai pin um
[8843.78 --> 8848.18]  so maybe no one's giving me anything in here well i don't think they've done anything
[8849.30 --> 8854.82]  so i think the the value is the stuff's done stuff they've done like design work for okay yeah yeah it's
[8854.82 --> 8858.18]  not like it's but i don't think they've released like a product it's not like johnny ive's just been
[8858.18 --> 8864.34]  like sitting there wouldn't be surprised i mean no i i would i would he seems like he seems like a go-getter
[8864.34 --> 8870.90]  grinder i just um what
[8873.38 --> 8880.74]  the 6.5 billion yeah what what is your what to sorry sorry what sorry sorry 6.5 billion what about
[8880.74 --> 8885.54]  the 6.5 billion what no you said what no no no don't worry about it doesn't matter okay i must
[8885.54 --> 8891.22]  have misheard you okay cool cool i i think i think it's the the whatever they've already been working
[8891.22 --> 8897.70]  together behind closed doors on a device sure but for six and a half billion dollars oh yeah
[8898.58 --> 8904.34]  like how many units of said device could you possibly be hoping to sell such that you could
[8904.34 --> 8910.42]  amortize over that number of units the 6.5 billion dollar acquisition of your partner i really you know
[8910.42 --> 8917.62]  the um you know the analysis that happened when elon like bought and sold his companies to each other
[8917.62 --> 8922.82]  yeah and people were like oh it's it's because he's like effectively moving money around so he has
[8922.82 --> 8928.42]  more stock control of a higher percentage of whatever blah blah blah i really wonder how much of that is
[8928.42 --> 8936.34]  happening unmasked in the ai space as there's like all this funding going in and then companies are
[8936.34 --> 8943.14]  finding like oh everyone kind of hates it and there's a lot of free models and there isn't actually a ton of
[8943.14 --> 8952.26]  money in like developing llm tech uh let's just like buy companies and do this other stuff to like move
[8952.26 --> 8964.50]  the money around i mean i guess um well hey congratulations johnny um that's a lot more money than you would have
[8964.50 --> 8971.30]  made hanging around at apple so yeah good job yeah sure
[8974.50 --> 8979.30]  unless just moving money around i mean i like really feel like it might be there's all these
[8979.30 --> 8986.58]  rumors about open ai and microsoft kind of breaking up and um i don't know the last thing that opening i
[8986.58 --> 8994.18]  did that was big in the news that wasn't drama compared to other companies that are like
[8995.54 --> 9001.38]  pushing big models and arguably more effective models and open ai's models many of which are just
[9001.38 --> 9008.66]  open source which just like largely removes the need for them to exist i don't know it's an interesting
[9008.66 --> 9016.82]  field for open ai right now but yeah um our discussion question which i actually do want to
[9016.82 --> 9024.90]  discuss for a bit is let's say this isn't a necklace let's just speculate that it's not a necklace
[9025.54 --> 9032.66]  what wearable ai tech can you think of that would actually be something you would consider buying
[9032.66 --> 9044.34]  because i have felt a little left behind by current hardware trends i don't want smart glasses at least
[9044.34 --> 9048.98]  not in their current format i don't know how many people do well some people do i mean meta's selling
[9048.98 --> 9057.14]  some glasses um i don't use i actually don't even this is not a copilot enabled pc i don't even have a
[9057.14 --> 9063.70]  copilot button this one isn't either yes it is it's right there oh um okay so you're clearly in the
[9063.70 --> 9068.26]  same situation as me oh my god it does do something when i press it well i'll have to kill that
[9069.70 --> 9077.38]  i'll find a way yeah it's not you okay it doesn't okay the point is i have used copilot enabled pc's
[9077.38 --> 9083.30]  and have only ever pressed the button by accident i i i don't never even press it by accident i don't use
[9083.30 --> 9090.18]  ai you know is there i blocked it out like you blocking out ads nice um but but people are you
[9090.18 --> 9095.78]  like i don't i don't really use it as part of my workflow like i'll occasionally uh fire up you know
[9095.78 --> 9103.70]  chat gpt or you know whatever to like when i was brainstorming um names for smash champs i i i was like
[9103.70 --> 9107.22]  oh okay yeah what would you call a badminton center i ultimately went with something that was different
[9107.22 --> 9111.86]  from anything yeah but use it as a sounding board yeah i used it as a sounding board but like i i almost
[9111.86 --> 9118.58]  never i will never rely on it i shouldn't say will never i don't mean that future looking maybe
[9118.58 --> 9125.30]  someday i will rely on it but i i never really rely on it right now um and and so i just feel like like
[9125.30 --> 9132.26]  all the new products that are coming out are like not for me i like to write things myself um i don't
[9132.26 --> 9140.42]  want to wear smart glasses and i'm just like can i just i don't know can i just have like ear pods
[9142.34 --> 9146.98]  oh okay like they could be headphones already i love how effective apple's branding is man
[9146.98 --> 9154.90]  the fact that you called them ear pods is like mind-blowing to me i i go out of my way consciously
[9155.46 --> 9162.66]  to call these my earphones these days because it just it bothers me that my kids call any earphones
[9162.66 --> 9170.82]  ear pods like it just bothers me air pods are not a monopoly even though they basically are and
[9170.82 --> 9177.46]  uh sorry sorry just bothers me the reason why i do like calling them ear pods i know they're the only
[9177.46 --> 9182.26]  ones that i hate all the other ones i mean you're wearing ones that seem to be staying in okay uh they
[9182.26 --> 9188.90]  like hurt because i had to jam them in like my ears will be sore for the rest of the day oh woe is
[9188.90 --> 9198.26]  me yeah i mean it's better than the other parts that are going to be sore uh okay sorry i don't know why
[9198.26 --> 9205.94]  i said that but okay if you look at like airpod 4s they got actually pretty significantly smaller yeah yeah
[9205.94 --> 9211.06]  yeah yeah yeah so there is room to have some expansion to fit a little bit more tech in there
[9212.02 --> 9216.66]  um especially if it's just like reporting out to your phone or something okay so and then you could
[9216.66 --> 9223.54]  hear because they they have the ability to talk to ellen okay so so but then let's let's let's ask
[9223.54 --> 9228.82]  the usual question right and that is why would that need to be in my earphones
[9229.78 --> 9238.34]  why wouldn't it just be in my phone which is connected to my earphones yeah okay so let's try
[9238.34 --> 9243.62]  again there's no wearable then though that's the problem other than glasses like what the heck would
[9243.62 --> 9255.22]  a necklace do nothing well it could have a camera on it
[9258.82 --> 9265.54]  you laugh but it's basically that stupid google thing yeah that google uh no like camera that would
[9265.54 --> 9270.90]  take pictures with ai at like the right times or whatever everyone's like completely forgotten
[9270.90 --> 9275.78]  about this i bring it up every once in a while it's so bad uh do you guys remember what that stupid
[9275.78 --> 9283.46]  thing was called chat um you're like pretty hyper out of time i can help you go pack up your room if you
[9283.46 --> 9289.86]  want uh sure um what else we need to get through we got a couple there's one more really important
[9289.86 --> 9298.10]  thing okay two brave souls our clip says hold on hold on yeah hold on google clip i think that's it

[9393.70 --> 9397.06]  it let's do a couple of messages sorry we should get one for the office i'd be down
[9399.46 --> 9407.06]  all right a couple left here hi dll recently upgraded pc after years why in 2025 does it seem like windows
[9408.02 --> 9414.58]  is windows unable to migrate apps and settings seamlessly for example android ios upgrades too
[9414.58 --> 9417.94]  where you setting up apps explorer pinned items is still so manual
[9420.50 --> 9427.06]  that's a good question i mean i i actually find the process pretty darn manual on and ios as well
[9427.06 --> 9432.42]  windows really sometimes you upgrade windows um pretty seamless or do they mean moving devices
[9432.42 --> 9437.38]  like a fresh install that's what it sounds like to me like when you yeah migration and and like
[9437.38 --> 9448.50]  i i guess for me i would say um there's a really really fine line between carrying forward settings
[9448.50 --> 9454.82]  that will be helpful to the user and carrying forward um crud that might have been like
[9455.46 --> 9462.58]  bunging up your previous windows install or your previous app install yeah um so i just don't know i
[9462.58 --> 9469.38]  don't know how you'd fix that without making a lot of other things worse yeah and you might say okay
[9469.38 --> 9475.70]  yeah but i'm the user i could decide what i prefer but a lot of users would probably use this convenient
[9475.70 --> 9482.26]  option and then have their system be bunged and then blame microsoft for it so i can see why
[9482.26 --> 9491.22]  a fresh install is a fresh install i i get it last i've got for you today uh linus have your badminton
[9491.22 --> 9499.46]  friends over there reacted to smash champs yet uh yeah yeah i i i had told them last year that it was
