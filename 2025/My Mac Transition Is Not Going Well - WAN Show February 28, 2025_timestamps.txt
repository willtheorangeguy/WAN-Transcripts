Mac Transition Timestamps - A Furious Mac Users Review of this Travesty

[41:29] "Ughh" ~ Linus. Uh oh.... entitled Windows User warning!
[41:45] "Mac OS is great... unless you try to use it as a desktop operating system." Inflatable hammer anyone?
[41:50] "My experience using the Mac book ... actually pretty solid" - This is promising
[41:55] "As long as I use it as a Mac book." The way this was delivered was a thinly veiled insult to Mac users. Well done Linus.
[42:00] "Nobody buys two cheap mac products" Because Linus, Mac's are not cheap. We can only afford one at a time.

What gets me is Linus buys two solutions and has some bizarre expectation they will operate as one. Seriously... since when has that ever been a thing? You buy a desktop solution or a laptop solution. So take all parity comparisons and throw them out the window please as they are pointless.

[42:55] "The whole thing is really seamless... in theory" Here we go boyz....
[43:00] "Calm the fuck down..." How about you Linus...

[43:38] "I haven't even tried to find fixes yet. I want an OOTB experience." 

Here-in lies the problem Linus, your approach. This is nothing like Windows and to expect it to behave in some known way is not a valid evaluation at all. You need to learn how to use it. It has a completely different system of window management and all this video shows is you NEVER read a guide or even watched the introduction video on how to use the system. It is clear to me that your expectations are driving you to the wrong conclusions. 

[45:30] "The only way to turn off the laptop screen is to close it, you can't just tell the screen to be off now." 

Do me a favor and re-read that first sentence slowly then come back here. Are you fucking serious? Of course you would only want it off when you close it. Why would you have an open screen that you don't want to see? This is not even an edge case...  this is just OCD/ADHD. Yes I CAN say this as I endure it as well.

[45:45] "I cannot actually believe that this is still a thing." This really surprised me. The way you put it was succinct and to the point. Mac resolution has always been like this. 

I have no idea of the origins of it but they have always had you choose a scale. It's annoying on monitors where it does not natively support their scaling and does not even give you the option. Maybe you have one of those? I had to find some tools to get the right resolution. In any case it would be great if this could be revisited by Apple and decided if it needed some more work. You may think so but there could be specific reasons why its built this way. In any case, your point is good but you really come over a bit upset. It's not all about you Linus.

[47:45] Display Link software will only help you if you have a Display Link certified dock
[48:40] Scroll behavior. This was a very good point, their mouse support really needs work. Kudo's.
[53:00] "Functionality does not appear to exist for Mac OS" Interesting and true, it does need work by Apple.
[57:15] "How do any of their products have bugs... " ~ Dan. What drives me wild is this level of ignorance on a global live stream no less.
[1:00:00] "Stop lights grayed out" Any dialogue opened up by an application has to be dealt with before you can continue to interact with that application. The dialogue takes the focus from the application and that is why the stop light is grayed out.
[1:02:20] "There is not really any way to save this" Because it is already saved the moment you take the screenshot. See application preferences/settings for the default location.
[1:02:30] "Don't worry about it, its really really good UI design..." That sarcasm is just lovely, take the companies biggest selling product and slap the developers right across the face.
[1:02:46] "Open finder and I will find out" As you found out,  Apple preview is an intentional foreground app which takes precedence. It is not meant to be left on the screen. If you do use alt-tab to get to any other app you have open.
[1:04:22] "It an inconsistent experience" You right but then again I believe its meant to be that way. 
[1:04:25] "Don't have to click twice" This comes down to understanding window management. No application in Mac OS will accept any input unless it has the current focus. To get this you have to click on it.
[1:11:50] "Why do you have to install so many programs... " ~ Dan. You make a good point.

I believe Apple are not trying to be all things to all people. They provide a robust and reliable platform on which you make your own mark. So they provide sensible defaults, at least for their own gear and the rest is left up the community. Like it or hate it, that's the way they roll. They are not trying to appeal to anyone, including Windows users. So you either learn how to use their OS properly or you pickup your dummy off the floor and leave. They are incredibly user friendly to those who stay and smile with benevolence at those who don't.  To be honest, they probably don't even notice your tantrum as they are too busy designing up new things to marvel us with.

[1:12:50] "No one uses Safari" Well on the desktop there are just better options like Firefox. But all system calls use Safari by default and all Mobile IOS systems do the same. They may have different UI on the mobile but underneath they are using the Safari engine. Native authentication mechanisms wont work without it. It's true users do use whatever in front of them.
[1:14:00] "Middle click press" There is no middle button, didn't you know? ~ ❤Apple

Have a nice day @linus @linustechtips
