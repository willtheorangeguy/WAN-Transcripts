[0.80 → 2.64] Hey everyone
[2.64 → 8.56] Before we start our pre-WAN show topic today, I'd like to acknowledge a couple folks
[8.56 → 13.76] I'd like to acknowledge our team who works so hard to deliver outstanding content to our community and second
[13.76 → 16.82] I'd like to acknowledge our community. No one's perfect
[17.56 → 22.12] Yes, even us and for as long as Linus Media Group has existed you guys have been there to help us
[22.32 → 28.16] You've held us accountable when we've gone astray, and you've also supported us when an attack against us is unfair
[28.16 → 30.82] And it's time for someone else to be held accountable
[30.82 → 34.80] Earlier this week gamers nexus took us out of context
[35.40 → 42.82] Again, and I can't keep ignoring this sort of thing Linus recently in a WAN show episode said the following
[43.68 → 49.68] Regarding why they did not make a video when they found out about the way honey works years ago
[49.90 → 53.22] In response to how he believed that he might be perceived
[53.22 → 58.52] If he had raised awareness to honey's actions when his team discovered them
[58.52 → 64.14] Everyone's mad at me. It's that simple the'm spreading the word for the smaller creators
[64.14 → 65.98] That argument doesn't save me there
[65.98 → 70.22] And it's not going to save me if I tell people to uninstall this extension that gets them a better deal so that
[70.22 → 70.94] Smaller
[70.94 → 73.82] Creators can get their affiliate revenue
[73.82 → 75.60] Are you kidding me?
[75.60 → 80.12] There is just no way that I make that video and I don't end up hanging from the nearest tree
[80.12 → 87.66] Well, that's the video we're making right now and if that were to result in backlash like he thinks it would then so be it
[89.40 → 94.08] Even if we ignore how disingenuous it is to compare the climate today and
[94.66 → 99.70] What we know today to the climate years ago when we originally dropped our honey sponsorship
[99.70 → 102.82] Our regular viewers will know that I provided
[103.36 → 106.86] Additional context that dramatically changes the meaning of that quote
[106.86 → 110.20] I mean, I don't expect everyone to agree with my viewpoint
[110.20 → 112.22] It's very clear that not everybody does
[112.22 → 115.14] But what I do expect is for it to be fairly represented
[115.14 → 117.64] And this particular instance of misquoting
[117.64 → 122.18] Is bad enough that many from Steve's own community have used words to describe it like
[122.18 → 123.14] Disappointing
[123.14 → 124.08] Misleading
[124.08 → 125.32] Disingenuous
[125.32 → 126.58] And straw man
[126.58 → 128.24] To my knowledge
[128.24 → 129.86] No retraction has been issued
[129.86 → 131.64] Even though I believe it is unlikely
[131.64 → 135.80] That the volume of comments about this went unnoticed by Steve and his team
[136.68 → 141.32] You guys may remember another video Steve made about us back in August 2023
[141.72 → 148.78] But what you might have missed is that his treatment of us then was part of the same pattern of poor ethics and misrepresentation
[148.98 → 152.12] To be clear many points in his video were valid
[152.32 → 159.46] But many others were not, and it was due to fundamental flaws in his approach not careless or sloppy flaws
[159.46 → 163.22] But objectively unethical unjournalistic flaws
[163.22 → 165.54] You shouldn't take my word for that
[165.54 → 170.26] While I do often report on things and I do my best to act in the community's interest
[170.26 → 171.46] I'm not a journalist
[171.46 → 174.82] So why don't we instead look at ethicsandjournalism.org
[174.82 → 179.76] They have some good articles on subjects like bad news bias and right to respond
[179.76 → 181.98] Or maybe we could look to the BBC
[181.98 → 183.50] You can pick your poison
[183.50 → 186.96] The point is that while not every publication has exactly the same rules
[186.96 → 193.64] There are plenty of helpful resources out there that outline the generally accepted standards and ethical responsibilities of a journalist
[193.88 → 199.14] It's clear reading any of them that Steve's approach in recent years falls short in numerous ways
[199.14 → 203.96] If you prefer a video summary, here's a convenient one from dr. Ian Sutras of more than more
[203.96 → 208.36] The story Gamers Nexus provides is one specifically about Linus Media Group
[208.36 → 210.56] Which changes the nature of such a topic
[210.56 → 214.44] For example, one part of ethical investigative journalism is
[214.44 → 217.62] Unless it's uncovering an explicit crime or break of the law
[217.62 → 220.70] Reaching out to get a formal response in advance
[220.70 → 224.70] Gamers Nexus did it with principal technologies and that blew up
[224.70 → 227.50] Gamers Nexus did it with Neck and that blew up
[227.50 → 230.60] Somehow those companies got special treatment
[230.60 → 232.44] But Linus Media Group did not
[232.44 → 234.76] This isn't me sticking up for Linus Media Group here
[234.76 → 237.40] But I'd be interested to hear the reason for the disparity
[237.40 → 242.08] Steve in his update video explicitly states he doesn't have to ask permission
[242.08 → 243.96] But that's not the point here
[243.96 → 247.84] Reaching out to Linus Media Group wouldn't stop you from posting your video
[247.84 → 253.84] Just like it didn't stop you posting him posting the principal technologies or Neck videos
[253.84 → 257.52] The precedent set for the last 20 years of tech journalism
[257.52 → 262.92] And 100 plus years of investigative journalism is that you at least reach out
[262.92 → 265.84] Ian's critique was carefully worded
[265.84 → 268.80] And I don't blame him given the climate at the time
[268.80 → 271.32] But it was both extremely valid
[271.32 → 275.00] And it was pointed enough that Steve felt compelled to respond to it
[275.00 → 278.06] Ironically, with a rushed late night ramble fest
[278.06 → 283.02] That was so poorly received that he pulled it down before I even got a chance to finish watching it back then
[283.02 → 286.22] Thankfully there are re-uploads of the video if you look for them
[286.22 → 289.42] But in a nutshell, Steve spent about 20 minutes rationalizing
[289.42 → 293.18] That decades of journalistic best practices around right to reply
[293.18 → 295.26] Simply don't apply to him
[295.26 → 300.10] It felt a little ironic coming from someone who has accused me of gaslighting in the past
[300.10 → 306.52] Now he did issue a sort of retraction via a community post that you can still find on the channel
[306.52 → 309.88] Where he committed to republish that video at a future date
[309.88 → 312.86] But he said that it would be within a broader channel update
[312.86 → 315.54] So I'm not actually sure if that ever happened
[315.54 → 319.86] And either way, what he didn't do is retract his flawed arguments
[319.86 → 321.42] Only the video where he made them
[321.42 → 326.12] I say this because you can still find many of these arguments on his secondary GN mini site
[326.12 → 328.08] In the ethics statements section
[328.08 → 331.76] Now obviously there are some valid policies in here
[331.76 → 336.08] But many of the others pretty much boil down to Steve's personal moral code
[336.08 → 338.64] Rather than the standard journalistic code
[338.64 → 339.82] And I'll expand on that a bit later
[339.82 → 341.64] But the short version is that
[341.64 → 344.44] No reputable journalist would validate his
[344.44 → 347.78] Arbitrary justification for his own conflicts of interest
[347.78 → 350.80] Or his convoluted no-contact policy
[350.80 → 354.24] That he used to justify his failure to reach out to us for comment
[354.24 → 355.86] As part of our right to respond
[355.86 → 362.24] Now some folks don't seem to understand why this is so important
[362.24 → 365.42] I have seen lots of speculation that
[365.42 → 367.30] Linus was just upset
[367.30 → 371.86] Because Steve cleverly didn't give him a chance to weasel out of legitimate criticism
[371.86 → 374.96] But that is not the case
[374.96 → 377.58] We have proven over the years
[377.58 → 378.50] Again and again
[378.50 → 380.84] We welcome constructive criticism
[380.84 → 384.62] And we go out of our way to maintain open communication channels with our community
[384.62 → 385.90] Like through our sponsor
[385.90 → 386.94] Excuse me
[386.94 → 388.66] Through our sponsor concerns section of our forum
[388.66 → 391.24] And through our incredible ECC squad
[391.24 → 394.28] Who lends us their expertise at multiple stages of our production pipeline
[394.28 → 395.64] No
[395.64 → 397.92] Right to respond matters
[397.92 → 402.06] Because of the impact that it can have on your accuracy
[402.06 → 404.24] By taking a single source
[404.24 → 406.82] And for his own reasons
[406.82 → 409.96] Refusing to fact-check their misrepresentations
[409.96 → 414.20] Steve made multiple critical errors in his coverage of the Billet Labs situation
[414.20 → 415.60] Now look
[415.60 → 418.16] I know this example is from two years ago
[418.16 → 420.72] But it's one that I'm obviously familiar with
[420.72 → 424.82] And it very clearly illustrates the way that Steve believed
[424.82 → 426.30] And still believes
[426.30 → 430.00] That he should be allowed to just avoid inconvenient data sources
[430.00 → 431.40] When he crafts his narratives
[431.40 → 432.98] First up
[432.98 → 435.98] Steve missed that Billet originally gifted the block to us
[435.98 → 437.92] We were under no obligation to return it
[437.92 → 440.68] He missed that they told us explicitly
[440.68 → 442.40] That it should work with a 4090
[442.40 → 443.78] Before we attempted it
[443.78 → 446.10] He missed that Billet told us
[446.10 → 449.42] They were comfortable with us publishing the underperforming results
[449.42 → 451.44] As long as we put it in context
[451.44 → 452.66] And finally
[452.66 → 456.28] Steve missed that the block only went into our charity auction
[456.28 → 457.94] Because of an internal miscommunication
[457.94 → 460.06] That left the block marked as keeper
[460.06 → 464.12] A mistake that I took action on within literal minutes of finding out
[464.12 → 465.42] Now
[465.42 → 468.80] I acknowledge that I didn't handle the situation perfectly
[468.80 → 469.72] But
[469.72 → 471.40] I think it is undeniable
[471.40 → 473.98] That these omissions and errors are significant
[473.98 → 475.88] And that they've done significant
[475.88 → 477.86] Possibly irreparable damage
[477.86 → 478.98] To my reputation
[478.98 → 480.00] To my company
[480.00 → 481.50] And to my finances
[481.50 → 484.10] To be clear
[484.10 → 486.46] I'm only pointing out the finances
[486.46 → 488.16] Because it's such an important factor
[488.16 → 489.74] In cases of libel and defamation
[489.74 → 491.98] As I stated recently
[491.98 → 493.56] When I was discussing the Honey Class Action
[493.56 → 495.50] I'm not a litigious person
[495.50 → 498.42] I have no intention of filing any kind of suit
[498.42 → 499.00] Because A
[499.00 → 500.82] It's really hard to say
[500.82 → 503.96] If the line to defamation has been clearly crossed
[503.96 → 504.38] And B
[504.38 → 506.30] It would be a giant waste of time and money
[506.30 → 507.10] For everyone involved
[507.10 → 510.08] I only bring it up to underscore the gravity of the situation
[510.08 → 511.64] The thing is
[511.64 → 512.78] Words mean what they mean
[512.78 → 514.30] And while morality
[514.30 → 515.92] Is a personal judgment
[515.92 → 518.06] Journalistic ethics is not
[518.06 → 520.26] It's determined by collaboration
[520.26 → 522.52] And consensus between peers in the industry
[522.52 → 523.54] Look
[523.54 → 525.38] If Steve wants to do his own thing
[525.38 → 528.38] And call himself a YouTuber with strong moral fibre
[528.38 → 529.88] That's his opinion
[529.88 → 531.00] And he's entitled to it
[531.00 → 532.62] And you're entitled to agree or disagree
[532.62 → 535.50] But if he wants to use words like ethics
[535.50 → 537.22] Or investigative journalism
[537.22 → 539.60] Then there are objective standards that he needs to uphold
[539.60 → 541.60] And he doesn't get to decide when they're important
[541.60 → 542.24] And when they're not
[542.24 → 545.98] Now I believe that Steve is aware of these distinctions
[545.98 → 547.74] Which suggests that he is either
[547.74 → 549.12] Ignoring his knowledge
[549.12 → 551.14] Because he has failed to properly understand it
[551.14 → 552.70] Or because he is dishonest
[552.70 → 556.12] I have no evidence to suggest that he is not smart enough
[556.12 → 557.32] To understand these principles
[557.32 → 560.12] What I do have experience with personally
[560.12 → 561.14] Is his dishonesty
[561.14 → 563.74] The misquote of me in the Honey lawsuit video
[563.74 → 565.60] That forced me to address this is self-evident
[565.60 → 568.36] But it's the rationalization
[568.36 → 569.84] For not reaching out about Billet
[569.84 → 571.38] That paints a more complete picture
[571.38 → 572.78] For starters
[572.78 → 573.86] He asserts
[573.86 → 576.16] That the information presented in his
[576.16 → 578.40] The Problem with Linus Media Group video
[578.40 → 580.12] Was already public knowledge
[580.12 → 582.10] Some of it was
[582.10 → 584.38] Some of it clearly wasn't
[584.38 → 587.14] Billet Labs' representations of our private communication
[587.14 → 588.86] Were not public knowledge
[588.86 → 590.74] And as we demonstrated in our response
[590.74 → 592.58] They were not provided in good faith
[592.58 → 594.18] Or with the appropriate context
[594.18 → 596.62] Had he reached out for clarification
[596.62 → 597.74] I feel it would have been clear
[597.74 → 598.58] Both to himself
[598.58 → 599.66] And to his audience
[599.66 → 602.08] That the events that led to the block being auctioned
[602.08 → 603.08] Were an honest accident
[603.08 → 604.76] Caused by a miscommunication
[604.76 → 608.52] I think it also would have been obvious
[608.52 → 609.44] That any perception
[609.44 → 610.66] That I behaved like a thief
[610.66 → 611.52] Or a liar
[611.52 → 613.46] Is not supported by the facts
[613.46 → 615.48] It also would have been clear
[615.48 → 616.90] That some retractions and corrections
[616.90 → 618.28] Were required in order to address
[618.28 → 619.48] The information that I provided
[619.48 → 620.56] To my knowledge
[620.56 → 622.40] No such action has been taken
[622.40 → 623.84] And the original video is still up
[623.84 → 625.36] Since we're at this
[625.36 → 627.02] I would also be very curious
[627.02 → 628.24] To see receipts for the claims
[628.24 → 628.94] That we have a
[628.94 → 629.94] History
[629.94 → 631.86] Of failure to resolve issues
[631.86 → 633.50] Or unprofessionalism
[633.50 → 634.50] In prior communications
[634.50 → 637.00] Okay
[637.00 → 638.24] GN further writes
[638.24 → 640.22] We previously had non-public contact
[640.22 → 641.24] With this organization
[641.24 → 642.38] LMG here
[642.38 → 643.68] About similar matters
[643.68 → 645.38] That were not resolved satisfactorily
[645.38 → 646.74] Or wherein we sometimes
[646.74 → 647.44] Were the recipients
[647.44 → 648.72] Of aggressive messaging
[648.72 → 649.64] Pertaining to review
[649.64 → 649.96] Top
[649.96 → 650.80] Topics
[650.80 → 651.12] Sorry
[651.12 → 651.62] Topics
[651.62 → 655.62] That is an extraordinary claim
[655.62 → 656.94] That I believe requires
[656.94 → 658.16] Extraordinary evidence
[658.16 → 659.62] I'm not going to deny
[659.62 → 660.42] I've had my fair share
[660.42 → 661.48] Of cranky days in my life
[661.48 → 662.44] It is possible
[662.44 → 663.00] Also
[663.00 → 664.24] That he could be referring
[664.24 → 665.14] To another individual
[665.14 → 665.76] Who worked here
[665.76 → 667.00] But I dug through
[667.00 → 667.98] Every DM and email
[667.98 → 668.78] That I could find
[668.78 → 669.56] With Steve
[669.56 → 671.00] I probably don't have
[671.00 → 671.46] All of them
[671.46 → 672.66] I have switched phones
[672.66 → 673.62] Many times in my life
[673.62 → 675.60] But I can't find
[675.60 → 676.28] Any evidence
[676.28 → 677.10] To support this
[677.10 → 678.72] I'm not perfect
[678.72 → 680.02] So I want to make it
[680.02 → 680.44] Up front
[680.44 → 681.00] Right here
[681.00 → 681.90] And say that
[681.90 → 683.02] If I acted unprofessionally
[683.02 → 683.76] Or aggressively
[683.76 → 684.48] At any point
[684.48 → 685.94] That was not my intention
[685.94 → 686.84] And I'm truly sorry
[686.84 → 688.44] But also
[688.44 → 690.40] The whole thing
[690.40 → 691.54] Just doesn't make any sense
[691.54 → 692.50] Like if you stop
[692.50 → 693.24] And think about it
[693.24 → 695.12] If he reached out
[695.12 → 695.58] For comment
[695.58 → 697.04] And I actually
[697.04 → 698.24] Responded
[698.24 → 698.74] In the manner
[698.74 → 699.40] That he alleges
[699.40 → 699.78] I might
[699.78 → 700.82] With dishonesty
[700.82 → 701.72] Or aggression
[701.72 → 703.98] Publishing that response
[703.98 → 704.26] Right
[704.26 → 706.14] That would be great
[706.14 → 707.52] Supporting material
[707.52 → 708.24] For his expose
[708.24 → 710.84] So even if
[710.84 → 711.48] The argument
[711.48 → 712.30] That he doesn't
[712.30 → 713.00] Need to reach out
[713.00 → 714.12] Because I could be rude
[714.12 → 714.60] In return
[714.60 → 715.48] Held up ethically
[715.48 → 716.86] Which it doesn't
[716.86 → 718.20] It also doesn't
[718.20 → 719.34] Hold up logically
[719.34 → 720.80] And the same goes
[720.80 → 721.44] For his claims
[721.44 → 722.96] That I could somehow
[722.96 → 723.72] Turn it into
[723.72 → 724.28] An opportunity
[724.28 → 725.14] To mislead
[725.14 → 727.20] Mislead who?
[728.12 → 729.06] Assuming his evidence
[729.06 → 730.24] And conclusions are solid
[730.24 → 731.68] Any deceptive action
[731.68 → 732.58] That I took in public
[732.58 → 733.48] Would again
[733.48 → 734.16] Give him further
[734.16 → 734.58] Ammunition
[734.58 → 735.42] To make his case
[735.42 → 737.96] And unless he's afraid
[737.96 → 738.98] That I could somehow
[738.98 → 741.26] Bamboozle him in private
[741.26 → 742.62] The most that I could do there
[742.62 → 743.56] Is offer an explanation
[743.56 → 744.26] Or context
[744.26 → 745.16] Both of which
[745.16 → 746.12] Could only help him
[746.12 → 748.50] If his intent
[748.50 → 749.08] Was truly
[749.08 → 750.36] To provide an accurate account
[750.36 → 752.02] Unfortunately
[752.02 → 752.82] As many of you
[752.82 → 753.68] Have come to realize
[753.68 → 754.32] After the latest
[754.32 → 754.80] Honey thing
[754.80 → 756.24] I don't believe
[756.24 → 756.86] That that was ever
[756.86 → 757.34] The intent
[757.34 → 758.92] Now look
[758.92 → 760.42] I know
[760.42 → 761.18] That the first
[761.18 → 762.24] Criticism of this segment
[762.24 → 762.78] Is going to be
[762.78 → 764.08] There goes Linus again
[764.08 → 765.08] And all emotional defensive
[765.08 → 768.16] But what would you do?
[768.42 → 769.34] What would you have me do?
[770.08 → 770.92] I apologized
[770.92 → 771.64] For the errors
[771.64 → 772.20] That we've made
[772.20 → 773.32] And I kept my mouth
[773.32 → 774.04] Shut about this stuff
[774.04 → 774.94] For ages
[774.94 → 776.24] In the interest
[776.24 → 777.22] Of moving past this
[777.22 → 778.92] It's not working
[778.92 → 779.92] And like
[779.92 → 781.30] This isn't some random
[781.30 → 782.42] Comment on Reddit guys
[782.42 → 783.60] This is an influencer
[783.60 → 785.02] With massive reach
[785.02 → 786.26] Misrepresenting me
[786.26 → 787.60] On an ongoing basis
[787.60 → 789.24] How long should
[789.24 → 790.44] I stay silent
[790.44 → 791.66] To atone for my real sins?
[792.04 → 792.84] And how many times
[792.84 → 793.68] Should I be unfairly
[793.68 → 794.36] Attacked before I'm
[794.36 → 794.96] Allowed to get
[794.96 → 795.90] Defensive?
[795.90 → 797.74] Thing is
[797.74 → 798.80] If I allow myself
[798.80 → 800.24] To be misrepresented
[800.24 → 801.38] That opens the door
[801.38 → 802.36] For someone else
[802.36 → 803.28] To be misrepresented
[803.28 → 804.42] At some point
[804.42 → 805.12] I'm sure you guys
[805.12 → 805.58] Can agree
[805.58 → 806.84] It becomes necessary
[806.84 → 807.92] To stand up for yourself
[807.92 → 809.24] I am not saying
[809.24 → 809.70] I'm perfect
[809.70 → 810.52] Spoiler
[810.52 → 811.82] I'm super not
[811.82 → 812.90] But there are
[812.90 → 813.94] Numerous
[813.94 → 814.94] Conflicts of interest
[814.94 → 815.76] Around Gamers Nexus
[815.76 → 816.34] Covering us
[816.34 → 817.38] In any way
[817.38 → 818.90] Which he well knows
[818.90 → 819.94] Because he lists them
[819.94 → 820.66] On his website
[820.66 → 822.62] And a token gesture
[822.62 → 823.98] Like forgoing the
[823.98 → 824.60] AdSense revenue
[824.60 → 825.28] On one video
[825.28 → 826.52] Falls a little flat
[826.52 → 827.44] When you compare
[827.44 → 828.16] What can be gained
[828.16 → 829.16] Through subscriber growth
[829.16 → 830.26] AdSense revenue
[830.26 → 831.08] On future videos
[831.08 → 832.16] Not to mention
[832.16 → 832.80] From elevating
[832.80 → 833.62] One's own reputation
[833.62 → 834.04] And brand
[834.04 → 835.04] At the cost of a competitor
[835.04 → 838.12] Over the last year and a half
[838.12 → 838.58] I've made
[838.58 → 840.10] Sometimes quite difficult
[840.10 → 841.02] Efforts to put aside
[841.02 → 841.78] My personal feelings
[841.78 → 842.30] And move on
[842.30 → 843.38] In spite of my
[843.38 → 844.36] Well-founded concerns
[844.36 → 845.58] About Steve's impartiality
[845.58 → 846.62] Not to mention
[846.62 → 848.32] The painful personal history
[848.32 → 849.32] Some of which
[849.32 → 850.02] I just laid out
[850.02 → 851.54] We
[851.54 → 852.98] Including me personally
[852.98 → 854.30] Have made an
[854.30 → 855.06] Active effort
[855.06 → 855.80] To just
[855.80 → 856.74] Go back to normal
[856.74 → 858.04] Start shouting out
[858.04 → 858.58] Gamers Nexus
[858.58 → 859.06] We've done it
[859.06 → 859.76] Multiple times
[859.76 → 860.38] For their stories
[860.38 → 860.88] Of reporting
[860.88 → 862.30] And so we should
[862.30 → 864.34] When people do good work
[864.34 → 865.22] We as an industry
[865.22 → 865.92] Should praise it
[865.92 → 866.92] But that should be
[866.92 → 867.54] A two-way street
[867.54 → 869.24] The honest truth
[869.24 → 870.22] Is I
[870.22 → 871.58] Don't actually know
[871.58 → 872.68] What Steve's issue
[872.68 → 873.10] With me
[873.10 → 874.00] Is today
[874.00 → 875.58] My last message
[875.58 → 875.94] To him
[875.94 → 876.96] Was on the day
[876.96 → 877.90] He published the expose
[877.90 → 879.44] And I never got a response
[879.44 → 881.26] I will read it here
[881.26 → 882.62] So we can all be on the same page
[882.62 → 886.06] A journalist
[886.06 → 887.18] Might have reached out
[887.18 → 887.88] For comment
[887.88 → 889.40] To get valuable context first
[889.40 → 890.64] But we both know that
[890.64 → 891.20] Once again
[891.20 → 892.06] This wasn't about
[892.06 → 893.44] Making the most accurate video
[893.44 → 894.66] Your glass house
[894.66 → 895.16] Is showing
[895.16 → 896.52] Here I'm referring
[896.52 → 896.98] Of course
[896.98 → 897.24] To
[897.24 → 898.62] The analogy
[898.62 → 899.62] Of throwing stones
[899.62 → 900.54] In a glass house
[900.54 → 903.16] Scaling beyond a few dudes
[903.16 → 904.04] Is a big challenge
[904.04 → 905.02] And I really hope
[905.02 → 905.38] That one day
[905.38 → 905.90] You get there
[905.90 → 907.28] One
[907.28 → 908.18] I still think
[908.18 → 908.94] That even if your judgment
[908.94 → 909.78] Is clouded right now
[909.78 → 910.82] By the giant conflict
[910.82 → 911.20] Of interest
[911.20 → 911.70] You have around
[911.70 → 912.38] Reporting on us
[912.38 → 913.66] Your heart's in the right place
[913.66 → 914.94] And that it would be
[914.94 → 915.62] Good for the industry
[915.62 → 916.58] Two
[916.58 → 917.82] I think it'll be good
[917.82 → 918.42] For your content
[918.42 → 919.44] And for your audience
[919.44 → 920.18] For you to have
[920.18 → 920.96] A broader perspective
[920.96 → 923.24] I'll be moving forward
[923.24 → 923.64] As normal
[923.64 → 924.56] And won't be participating
[924.56 → 925.18] In any kind of
[925.18 → 926.28] Nonsense public sniping
[926.28 → 927.56] It'd be good for views
[927.56 → 927.94] Or whatever
[927.94 → 929.04] But I'm pretty focused
[929.04 → 929.80] On growing the company
[929.80 → 930.76] And our test capabilities
[930.76 → 931.42] And our team
[931.42 → 932.82] You're still welcome
[932.82 → 933.84] At future LTX events
[933.84 → 934.78] And we'd be happy
[934.78 → 935.72] To resume working together
[935.72 → 936.24] In good faith
[936.24 → 937.20] If you ever decide again
[937.20 → 937.94] That working together
[937.94 → 938.36] As press
[938.36 → 939.50] Is good for the industry
[939.50 → 940.78] Until then
[940.78 → 941.72] Linus
[941.72 → 944.94] What I said holds true today
[944.94 → 946.32] Including the part at the end
[946.32 → 947.38] I want to move forward
[947.38 → 948.32] But that's going to take
[948.32 → 949.30] Some work from both parties
[949.30 → 950.20] Not just me
[950.20 → 951.68] So I'm going to shift gears
[951.68 → 952.26] And the next part
[952.26 → 953.22] Will be directed to Steve
[953.22 → 954.48] Who was sent an advance
[954.48 → 955.50] Copy of my letter today
[955.50 → 957.04] Which he has responded to
[957.04 → 957.48] Kind of
[957.48 → 958.72] Along with a request
[958.72 → 959.16] For comment
[959.16 → 959.76] On his apparent
[959.76 → 960.50] Personal challenges
[960.50 → 961.22] Around covering us
[961.22 → 961.72] Objectively
[961.72 → 963.36] Steve
[963.36 → 965.00] On WAN Show today
[965.00 → 965.82] I'll be doing a segment
[965.82 → 966.96] Outlining some of the ethical
[966.96 → 967.82] And journalistic issues
[967.82 → 968.54] With your content
[968.54 → 969.70] That I have observed personally
[969.70 → 970.40] And that I have seen
[970.40 → 971.16] Raised by the community
[971.16 → 972.80] I will be especially focused
[972.80 → 973.88] On how they have impacted
[973.88 → 974.56] Your coverage of me
[974.56 → 975.08] And my company
[975.08 → 976.46] Because I'm most familiar
[976.46 → 977.36] With the relevant facts
[977.36 → 978.74] But these issues
[978.74 → 979.66] Appear to run deeper
[979.66 → 980.64] And I believe they could be
[980.64 → 981.42] Impacting your ability
[981.42 → 982.48] To be objective overall
[982.48 → 983.34] Something I know
[983.34 → 984.44] The community values greatly
[984.44 → 987.08] There will be a particular
[987.08 → 988.00] Focus on your stance
[988.00 → 989.12] Around right of reply
[989.12 → 990.32] Since it affects accuracy
[990.32 → 990.90] So much
[990.90 → 992.02] And there will also be
[992.02 → 992.54] Some discussion
[992.54 → 993.42] Around misquoting
[993.42 → 994.14] As in the recent
[994.14 → 994.66] Honey video
[994.66 → 996.00] As well as your ability
[996.00 → 997.00] To address
[997.00 → 997.88] Or as your inability
[997.88 → 999.04] To address your clear
[999.04 → 999.80] Conflicts of interest
[999.80 → 1000.40] When it comes to
[1000.40 → 1000.96] Covering an entity
[1000.96 → 1001.60] That you have chosen
[1001.60 → 1002.72] To view as a direct competitor
[1002.72 → 1004.32] Rather than as a collaborator
[1004.32 → 1004.78] Or peer
[1004.78 → 1005.98] As you did in the past
[1005.98 → 1008.86] If you have some comments
[1008.86 → 1009.84] And evidence
[1009.84 → 1010.96] On what breakdowns
[1010.96 → 1011.74] Caused your inaccurate
[1011.74 → 1013.12] Coverage of us in the past
[1013.12 → 1014.58] Why you seem to find
[1014.58 → 1015.50] It is so challenging
[1015.50 → 1016.40] To cover us objectively
[1016.40 → 1017.84] And what steps you plan
[1017.84 → 1018.56] To make to rectify
[1018.56 → 1019.44] These issues in the future
[1019.44 → 1020.34] I would be happy
[1020.34 → 1021.16] To include your thoughts
[1021.16 → 1021.80] In this segment
[1021.80 → 1024.02] The segment will also include
[1024.02 → 1024.70] The following letter
[1024.70 → 1025.76] That is addressed to you
[1025.76 → 1028.28] Steve, we do our best
[1028.28 → 1028.90] Around here to do
[1028.90 → 1029.64] What we believe is right
[1029.64 → 1030.28] And to stand up
[1030.28 → 1030.84] For the consumer
[1030.84 → 1032.06] That leads to us
[1032.06 → 1032.80] Doing journalist-y
[1032.80 → 1033.44] Things sometimes
[1033.44 → 1034.34] And I understand
[1034.34 → 1035.68] Basic journalistic principles
[1035.68 → 1036.72] But I'm not a journalist
[1036.72 → 1037.76] And I've never claimed to be
[1037.76 → 1038.92] The reason I'm sending
[1038.92 → 1039.48] This to you then
[1039.48 → 1040.36] Is not because I'm
[1040.36 → 1040.84] Some journalist
[1040.84 → 1041.66] Reaching out for comment
[1041.66 → 1042.70] But out of respect
[1042.70 → 1043.86] And because I was
[1043.86 → 1044.64] Once a collaborator
[1044.64 → 1045.10] And supporter
[1045.10 → 1046.20] And I hope to be again someday
[1046.20 → 1048.48] For that to happen though
[1048.48 → 1050.16] I do have some requests
[1050.16 → 1051.80] Everyone is human
[1051.80 → 1053.08] And we all make mistakes
[1053.08 → 1054.34] But I believe that
[1054.34 → 1054.94] For you to become
[1054.94 → 1056.28] The journalist you aspire to be
[1056.28 → 1057.34] There are some errors
[1057.34 → 1058.30] In both your approach
[1058.30 → 1059.38] And in your coverage
[1059.38 → 1060.08] That are large enough
[1060.08 → 1060.90] To merit correction
[1060.90 → 1062.42] Obviously
[1062.42 → 1063.86] Not everything needs to be pulled
[1063.86 → 1065.26] Your methods aside
[1065.26 → 1066.40] It's clear you were right
[1066.40 → 1067.18] About a lot of things
[1067.18 → 1068.02] In August of 23
[1068.02 → 1069.90] But it's also clear
[1069.90 → 1071.10] That between the conjecture
[1071.10 → 1072.30] Editorialization
[1072.30 → 1073.58] And what I hope
[1073.58 → 1074.98] Are simply errors
[1074.98 → 1075.92] Rather than lies
[1075.92 → 1077.40] A number of retractions
[1077.40 → 1077.94] Are in order
[1077.94 → 1079.06] Both on that piece
[1079.06 → 1080.36] And in your other coverage
[1080.36 → 1081.98] This isn't just for me
[1081.98 → 1083.30] But also for your community
[1083.30 → 1084.00] Who looks to you
[1084.00 → 1084.76] To do the right thing
[1084.76 → 1086.94] As for the personal side
[1086.94 → 1087.28] Of things
[1087.28 → 1088.86] I can't ask you to like me
[1088.86 → 1090.28] You clearly disagree
[1090.28 → 1091.36] On a personal
[1091.36 → 1092.48] Moral basis
[1092.48 → 1093.56] With some things I do
[1093.56 → 1094.92] Which of them are real
[1094.92 → 1095.94] And which of them are performative
[1095.94 → 1097.06] I'm actually not sure anymore
[1097.06 → 1098.18] But it doesn't matter
[1098.18 → 1099.42] That's your personal compass
[1099.42 → 1100.50] And you've got to follow it
[1100.50 → 1103.26] What does matter
[1103.26 → 1104.02] Is treating others
[1104.02 → 1104.44] In the industry
[1104.44 → 1105.18] With respect
[1105.18 → 1106.30] And being prepared
[1106.30 → 1107.00] To be held accountable
[1107.00 → 1107.50] The same way
[1107.50 → 1108.50] You hold others accountable
[1108.50 → 1110.04] Traditional journalism
[1110.04 → 1111.64] While a competitive battlefield
[1111.64 → 1113.16] Has no absolute authority
[1113.16 → 1114.04] And is quite often
[1114.04 → 1114.70] A brotherhood
[1114.70 → 1115.62] With shared goals
[1115.62 → 1116.98] That hold each other
[1116.98 → 1117.48] Accountable
[1117.48 → 1119.22] To mutually agreed upon
[1119.22 → 1119.80] Standards
[1119.80 → 1120.40] Standards
[1120.40 → 1121.60] It's not a brutal
[1121.60 → 1122.12] Free for all
[1122.12 → 1124.14] So as part of being
[1124.14 → 1124.96] A contributing member
[1124.96 → 1125.76] Of the tech brotherhood
[1125.76 → 1126.86] I expect you to be
[1126.86 → 1127.50] Open to critique
[1127.50 → 1128.08] In the same way
[1128.08 → 1128.88] That you expect others
[1128.88 → 1129.78] To be open to critique
[1129.78 → 1131.64] I also expect
[1131.64 → 1132.42] That if you cover us
[1132.42 → 1133.28] Publicly in the future
[1133.28 → 1134.50] You do so with honesty
[1134.50 → 1135.58] Impartiality
[1135.58 → 1136.76] And proper disclosure
[1136.76 → 1137.64] Of your numerous
[1137.64 → 1138.70] Conflicts of interest
[1138.70 → 1140.12] With that said
[1140.12 → 1141.34] Regardless of your motives
[1141.34 → 1141.82] In 23
[1141.82 → 1143.16] Your actions did
[1143.16 → 1144.36] Serve as a wake-up call
[1144.36 → 1145.36] For us to supercharge
[1145.36 → 1146.22] The changes that we were
[1146.22 → 1146.78] Slow rolling
[1146.78 → 1147.98] And for that I'm thankful
[1147.98 → 1149.98] Now it's time for your
[1149.98 → 1150.50] Wake-up call
[1150.50 → 1151.84] Should you choose to accept it
[1151.84 → 1153.66] If you can't
[1153.66 → 1154.72] Put your biases aside
[1154.72 → 1156.40] Simply recusing yourself
[1156.40 → 1157.14] Is an option
[1157.14 → 1158.40] But it might require
[1158.40 → 1159.58] Some further retractions
[1159.58 → 1160.26] Since you've claimed
[1160.26 → 1160.78] In the past
[1160.78 → 1161.82] That covering us
[1161.82 → 1163.28] Is so very important
[1163.28 → 1164.36] Because of our business's
[1164.36 → 1165.56] Relevance to the tech industry
[1165.56 → 1167.10] Well if that's no longer
[1167.10 → 1167.50] The case
[1167.50 → 1168.28] Then any snipes
[1168.28 → 1168.98] That relied on that
[1168.98 → 1169.70] For justification
[1169.70 → 1171.18] Probably need to go too
[1171.18 → 1173.72] I understand you may not want
[1173.72 → 1174.52] To rebuild this bridge
[1174.52 → 1176.68] But I still want you to know
[1176.68 → 1178.28] That while Gamers Nexus LLC
[1178.28 → 1180.00] Is every bit as much
[1180.00 → 1181.18] Of a for-profit business
[1181.18 → 1183.06] As Linus Media Group Incorporated
[1183.06 → 1185.62] I, Linus Sebastian the individual
[1185.62 → 1186.62] Still see you
[1186.62 → 1188.00] Steven Burke the individual
[1188.00 → 1188.72] As a colleague
[1188.72 → 1190.20] And potential future collaborator
[1190.20 → 1191.76] Because the reality of it is
[1191.76 → 1192.70] Personal feelings aside
[1192.70 → 1194.32] We both fight for the same team
[1194.32 → 1195.88] The consumers and the community
[1195.88 → 1197.50] A community that is stronger
[1197.50 → 1199.14] If we just cut the tribalism
[1199.14 → 1199.94] And work together
[1199.94 → 1202.72] I've always said
[1202.72 → 1203.58] That a rising tide
[1203.58 → 1204.22] Lifts all ships
[1204.22 → 1205.30] And that we all benefit
[1205.30 → 1206.44] From more interest in our hobby
[1206.44 → 1207.36] And more contributors
[1207.36 → 1208.04] To our community
[1208.04 → 1209.96] I have always encouraged
[1209.96 → 1210.36] Our viewers
[1210.36 → 1211.88] To follow multiple outlets
[1211.88 → 1213.36] And get multiple perspectives
[1213.36 → 1214.50] Including yours
[1214.50 → 1216.26] You used to tell me
[1216.26 → 1216.74] That you agreed
[1216.74 → 1217.38] With those things
[1217.38 → 1218.74] I hope you can again
[1218.74 → 1219.86] Because this is going to be
[1219.86 → 1220.58] Especially important
[1220.58 → 1221.84] As we navigate the weirdness
[1221.84 → 1223.06] Around benchmarking
[1223.06 → 1224.16] Machine learning assisted cards
[1224.16 → 1225.42] Like the upcoming 50 series
[1225.42 → 1227.02] So in summary
[1227.02 → 1228.84] I welcome valid
[1228.84 → 1229.90] Constructive
[1229.90 → 1231.06] Good faith
[1231.06 → 1232.22] Two-way feedback
[1232.22 → 1233.48] But when I told you
[1233.48 → 1233.92] A year ago
[1233.92 → 1234.68] That I had no interest
[1234.68 → 1235.66] In public sniping matches
[1235.66 → 1236.78] That was the truth
[1236.78 → 1238.36] Our community in tech
[1238.36 → 1239.44] Used to stand out
[1239.44 → 1240.84] As one that embraced
[1240.84 → 1241.56] Collaboration
[1241.56 → 1242.72] And rejected beef
[1242.72 → 1244.48] I would like that again
[1244.48 → 1246.64] I chose to make my statement
[1246.64 → 1247.74] As a segment on WAN Show
[1247.74 → 1248.80] And a clip on our clips channels
[1248.80 → 1250.10] Rather than a dedicated video
[1250.10 → 1251.24] In hopes of finding a balance
[1251.24 → 1252.68] Between sharing my side
[1252.68 → 1253.06] Finally
[1253.06 → 1255.40] And igniting drama
[1255.40 → 1255.88] For views
[1255.88 → 1257.82] So can we forget the past
[1257.82 → 1258.36] And move forward?
[1259.08 → 1260.06] See you at Computer
[1260.06 → 1261.00] Linus
[1261.00 → 1262.28] Now
[1262.28 → 1264.02] I'd like to come back
[1264.02 → 1264.84] To addressing you all
[1264.84 → 1266.60] For once
[1266.60 → 1267.64] In the history
[1267.64 → 1268.60] Of online communities
[1268.60 → 1270.54] Guys I beg of you
[1270.54 → 1271.10] This is not
[1271.10 → 1272.12] Ooh shots fired
[1272.12 → 1273.48] Do not
[1273.48 → 1274.58] Get into a mudslinging
[1274.58 → 1275.26] Match over this
[1275.26 → 1276.48] Continue
[1276.48 → 1277.64] The good work you do
[1277.64 → 1278.92] Holding creators accountable
[1278.92 → 1280.20] But this is not
[1280.20 → 1281.20] And it should never be
[1281.20 → 1282.28] LTT versus
[1282.28 → 1283.12] GN
[1283.12 → 1284.26] Us versus them
[1284.26 → 1286.00] Some folks
[1286.00 → 1287.10] Are going to insist
[1287.10 → 1288.40] On interpreting it that way
[1288.40 → 1290.28] But I believe that the majority
[1290.28 → 1291.62] The rational viewers
[1291.62 → 1292.72] Should be able to see
[1292.72 → 1293.76] The truth of what I'm saying
[1293.76 → 1294.94] Even if they don't
[1294.94 → 1295.98] Always agree with the source
[1295.98 → 1297.00] And see the importance
[1297.00 → 1297.62] Of moving on
[1297.62 → 1299.28] As for the ones
[1299.28 → 1300.26] That can't do that
[1300.26 → 1301.06] Look
[1301.06 → 1301.90] If their viewpoint
[1301.90 → 1302.54] Is closed
[1302.54 → 1304.06] We gain nothing
[1304.06 → 1305.22] By arguing with them
[1305.22 → 1306.64] Except wasting our energy
[1306.64 → 1308.16] Energy we need to power
[1308.16 → 1309.36] RTX 5090s
[1309.36 → 1311.24] So let's rise above it
[1311.24 → 1314.18] So with that in mind then
[1314.18 → 1315.56] Funny memes
[1315.56 → 1316.64] Inbounds
[1316.64 → 1317.98] I like humour
[1317.98 → 1318.62] As much as anyone
[1318.62 → 1320.62] But if Steve wants to move on
[1320.62 → 1321.28] Then I would like to
[1321.28 → 1321.92] Respectfully
[1321.92 → 1323.04] Request an end
[1323.04 → 1324.74] To the GN bashing posts
[1324.74 → 1325.54] For that matter
[1325.54 → 1326.42] Any other publication
[1326.42 → 1327.56] In our various
[1327.56 → 1328.74] Community gathering places
[1328.74 → 1329.98] YouTube comments
[1329.98 → 1330.78] Discord
[1330.78 → 1331.34] Reddit
[1331.34 → 1332.28] And the LTT forum
[1332.28 → 1333.52] And any that I haven't thought of
[1333.52 → 1335.24] I'd like us to be the change
[1335.24 → 1336.08] We want to see in the world
[1336.08 → 1337.36] Thank you guys
[1337.36 → 1338.74] One last note
[1338.74 → 1340.28] I know that we did announce
[1340.28 → 1341.34] That we were going to launch
[1341.34 → 1342.28] Our mod mat this week
[1342.28 → 1343.54] A project by the way
[1343.54 → 1344.44] That we kicked off
[1344.44 → 1346.36] Long before the August controversy
[1346.36 → 1347.76] And that was created
[1347.76 → 1349.22] In collaboration with Mod Rite
[1349.22 → 1350.74] The owner of the mod mat patent
[1350.74 → 1351.48] Who's been making them
[1351.48 → 1352.22] Since before anyone
[1352.22 → 1353.10] In the creator space
[1353.10 → 1353.96] Got the idea
[1353.96 → 1355.20] But
[1355.20 → 1356.54] Even though our mod mat
[1356.54 → 1357.86] Has nothing to do with Steve
[1357.86 → 1359.28] I felt it would be tacky
[1359.28 → 1360.46] For us to have a long discussion
[1360.46 → 1361.90] About an important topic like this
[1361.90 → 1364.38] Then immediately pitch to a sales pitch
[1364.38 → 1366.00] Or pivot to a sales pitch
[1366.00 → 1366.92] For a product that competes
[1366.92 → 1367.40] With one of his
[1367.40 → 1368.22] So we're pushing the launch
[1368.22 → 1368.74] To next week
[1368.74 → 1370.30] Now
[1370.30 → 1372.72] With that unpleasant business
[1372.72 → 1373.24] Out of the way
[1373.24 → 1376.10] Welcome to the LAN show
[1376.10 → 1377.52] We've got a great show
[1377.52 → 1378.74] For you guys this week
[1378.74 → 1379.98] I went on
[1379.98 → 1381.26] The Tonight Show
[1381.26 → 1382.20] With Jimmy Fallon
[1382.20 → 1382.88] So I'm going to be
[1382.88 → 1383.66] Talking about that
[1383.66 → 1384.04] I had
[1384.04 → 1385.34] Dude
[1385.34 → 1387.18] I had the time of my life
[1387.18 → 1388.36] I'm
[1388.36 → 1389.62] I honestly know
[1389.62 → 1390.50] Very little about it
[1390.50 → 1391.66] And I'm just as
[1391.66 → 1392.24] Interested as
[1392.24 → 1393.06] Probably they are
[1393.06 → 1393.60] To hear about it
[1393.60 → 1394.10] I'm stoked
[1394.10 → 1395.02] We're also going to be
[1395.02 → 1395.66] Talking about
[1395.66 → 1396.88] A perception that I've seen
[1396.88 → 1397.52] In the community
[1397.52 → 1399.06] That review embargoes
[1399.06 → 1399.80] Are bad
[1399.80 → 1400.28] Yeah
[1400.28 → 1401.02] Let's talk about that
[1401.02 → 1401.82] What else we got this week
[1401.82 → 1402.98] Nintendo officially announced
[1402.98 → 1403.88] The Switch 2
[1403.88 → 1405.54] And goodbye
[1405.54 → 1406.50] TikTok
[1406.50 → 1408.14] And what's happening
[1408.14 → 1409.00] In the world of apps
[1409.00 → 1409.78] Because of that
[1409.78 → 1412.12] I was prepared
[1412.12 → 1412.98] Look at that
[1412.98 → 1413.76] Wow
[1413.76 → 1418.04] What year is it dude
[1418.04 → 1420.18] Thanks
[1420.18 → 1429.38] The show is brought to you today
[1429.38 → 1429.84] By
[1429.84 → 1430.80] Honey
[1430.80 → 1431.88] Messi
[1431.88 → 1433.70] Our reps
[1433.70 → 1435.52] And rocket money
[1435.52 → 1436.68] And of course
[1436.68 → 1437.92] By our rap partner
[1437.92 → 1438.42] Brand
[1438.42 → 1439.38] And our chair partner
[1439.38 → 1440.84] Secret Lab
[1440.84 → 1444.80] And he's dead
[1444.80 → 1445.44] Got him
[1445.44 → 1447.86] I knew about most of this
[1447.86 → 1449.16] I didn't know about that
[1449.16 → 1450.20] I just made that
[1450.20 → 1451.08] Oh my
[1451.08 → 1452.86] I was feeling irreverent
[1452.86 → 1454.42] Lift the tension
[1454.42 → 1456.40] Do we wanna
[1456.40 → 1457.48] What are we doing
[1457.48 → 1457.94] What are we doing
[1457.94 → 1458.72] Are we doing Fallon
[1458.72 → 1459.44] Are we doing one of mine
[1459.44 → 1460.38] What's the plan
[1460.38 → 1461.78] I wanna talk about
[1461.78 → 1462.70] The Tonight Show
[1462.70 → 1463.08] Okay
[1463.08 → 1465.54] On Wednesday
[1465.54 → 1466.56] So what
[1466.56 → 1467.72] What this would be
[1467.72 → 1468.34] On the
[1468.34 → 1468.74] Okay
[1468.74 → 1470.30] How annoying is it
[1470.30 → 1471.30] That you click the thing down here
[1471.30 → 1472.34] And the calendar doesn't pop out anymore
[1472.34 → 1472.50] So
[1472.50 → 1473.70] So on Wednesday
[1473.70 → 1475.28] The 8th
[1475.28 → 1476.72] I got an email
[1476.72 → 1477.46] That was like
[1477.46 → 1478.94] Hey
[1478.94 → 1479.38] So
[1479.38 → 1480.94] Like CES
[1480.94 → 1481.52] Right man
[1481.52 → 1482.04] Yeah
[1482.04 → 1482.58] And I'm like
[1482.58 → 1484.20] Yeah I'm a little busy
[1484.20 → 1484.64] I'm like
[1484.64 → 1485.16] You know
[1485.16 → 1485.96] Covering CES
[1485.96 → 1486.68] I'm there right now
[1486.68 → 1488.08] I'm literally there right now
[1488.08 → 1488.66] But yeah
[1488.66 → 1489.30] CES
[1489.30 → 1489.88] And they're like
[1489.88 → 1492.20] Do you want to be on The Tonight Show
[1492.20 → 1492.98] With Jimmy Fallon
[1492.98 → 1493.42] I'm like
[1493.42 → 1495.68] I have to be honest with you
[1495.68 → 1496.46] I knew
[1496.46 → 1497.28] My answer
[1497.28 → 1498.34] But immediately
[1498.34 → 1499.04] I was like
[1499.04 → 1502.92] I have to trust
[1502.92 → 1504.40] I don't wanna just trust myself
[1504.40 → 1504.94] On this one
[1504.94 → 1505.16] Because
[1505.16 → 1507.16] It's a huge stage
[1507.16 → 1508.30] And on the one hand
[1508.30 → 1509.24] I could nail it
[1509.24 → 1510.22] But on the other hand
[1510.22 → 1511.82] I could bomb it
[1511.82 → 1512.30] Oh yeah
[1512.30 → 1512.62] Oh yeah
[1512.62 → 1513.16] I have that
[1513.16 → 1513.96] Dude
[1513.96 → 1515.46] I have bombed things
[1515.46 → 1516.18] It's also like
[1516.18 → 1517.50] As much as
[1517.50 → 1518.22] Honestly I think
[1518.22 → 1518.88] The viewership
[1518.88 → 1519.54] Across both
[1519.54 → 1521.06] I googled what the viewership
[1521.06 → 1521.92] For that show is
[1521.92 → 1522.50] I think it's like
[1522.50 → 1523.80] Honestly fairly similar
[1523.80 → 1524.06] Okay
[1524.06 → 1525.04] We can talk about that
[1525.04 → 1525.66] More later though
[1525.66 → 1526.54] Whether that's true or not
[1526.54 → 1527.14] I have no idea
[1527.14 → 1528.72] But it's just a totally
[1528.72 → 1529.84] Different thing
[1529.84 → 1531.40] It's not
[1531.40 → 1531.82] It's not
[1531.82 → 1532.34] The way I show
[1532.34 → 1533.22] This is like
[1533.22 → 1534.98] A home turf advantage
[1534.98 → 1535.44] You know
[1535.44 → 1536.14] Like there's
[1536.14 → 1537.06] There are the sets
[1537.06 → 1537.40] Yes
[1537.40 → 1538.50] There are things that we're used to
[1538.50 → 1539.32] You've done show coverage
[1539.32 → 1539.60] For a decade
[1539.60 → 1540.42] I'm with my shooters
[1540.42 → 1542.08] Who I can riff with
[1542.08 → 1542.94] And stuff like that
[1542.94 → 1543.38] Like there's
[1543.38 → 1544.46] There are things that you're used to
[1544.46 → 1544.90] And then there's
[1544.90 → 1546.08] Then there's just completely
[1546.08 → 1546.64] Like
[1546.64 → 1549.42] Whatever the heck
[1549.42 → 1550.44] That experience was
[1550.44 → 1551.24] I can't even imagine
[1551.24 → 1551.58] Okay
[1551.58 → 1552.02] So anyway
[1552.02 → 1553.24] So the first thing I did
[1553.24 → 1554.24] Was I fired off an email
[1554.24 → 1554.98] To I think
[1554.98 → 1555.50] Colton
[1555.50 → 1556.52] Yvonne
[1556.52 → 1557.40] Chewy
[1557.40 → 1558.74] Who's our community manager
[1558.74 → 1559.48] And
[1559.48 → 1560.72] I think I included
[1560.72 → 1561.28] Taryn as well
[1561.28 → 1561.56] I'm like
[1561.56 → 1563.16] What do you think
[1563.16 → 1564.74] Should I do this
[1564.74 → 1566.76] And they were basically like
[1566.76 → 1567.42] Oh yeah
[1567.42 → 1568.04] And James
[1568.04 → 1568.66] James S
[1568.66 → 1569.04] Because
[1569.04 → 1570.82] It would disrupt
[1570.82 → 1571.74] Our production schedule
[1571.74 → 1572.22] A little bit
[1572.22 → 1572.78] Like it basically
[1572.78 → 1573.66] Costs three days
[1573.66 → 1574.68] Because of the timing
[1574.68 → 1574.78] Oh yeah
[1574.78 → 1576.36] I had to fly in the day before
[1576.36 → 1577.80] I had to do the show
[1577.80 → 1579.00] Wait did I fly in the day before
[1579.00 → 1580.48] Or no I did a red eye
[1580.48 → 1581.46] I did a red eye
[1581.46 → 1582.16] The night of
[1582.16 → 1583.52] And then did the show
[1583.52 → 1584.30] And then I had to fly out
[1584.30 → 1584.90] The next day
[1584.90 → 1585.90] And the show's not
[1585.90 → 1586.80] At night
[1586.80 → 1587.96] I thought it was live
[1587.96 → 1588.60] This whole time
[1588.60 → 1589.16] It's
[1589.16 → 1589.76] I mean
[1589.76 → 1590.30] I haven't
[1590.30 → 1591.52] It's live to tape
[1591.52 → 1592.54] I haven't watched one
[1592.54 → 1594.02] So in terms of the actual
[1594.02 → 1595.32] Filming experience
[1595.32 → 1597.46] It functionally might as well
[1597.46 → 1598.06] Be live
[1598.06 → 1599.00] Because they're doing
[1599.00 → 1600.46] Live camera switching
[1600.46 → 1602.26] But it actually
[1602.26 → 1603.16] Like if you've ever
[1603.16 → 1604.28] Attended it in person
[1604.28 → 1605.42] Which you can do
[1605.42 → 1606.84] And it was a packed house
[1606.84 → 1607.58] Because like
[1607.58 → 1609.36] Bad Bunny was on the show
[1609.36 → 1611.66] It's actually a few hours
[1611.66 → 1613.28] Before the airing
[1613.28 → 1613.78] Of the episode
[1613.78 → 1614.88] So they have time to
[1614.88 → 1615.50] You know
[1615.50 → 1616.26] Bleep any
[1616.26 → 1618.26] Terrible cuss words
[1618.26 → 1619.76] I thought it was like
[1619.76 → 1621.70] A 15-second buffer
[1621.70 → 1622.50] Or something
[1622.50 → 1623.94] So they had time to bleep
[1623.94 → 1625.64] And like block things out
[1625.64 → 1626.08] And that's it
[1626.08 → 1627.32] No but what I will say
[1627.32 → 1628.98] Is that the taping experience
[1628.98 → 1630.38] Is really not paced
[1630.38 → 1632.34] From what I saw
[1632.34 → 1633.18] That differently
[1633.18 → 1634.60] Than if it was live
[1634.60 → 1634.88] I think
[1634.88 → 1636.16] If I was to guess
[1636.16 → 1637.50] I would say the liveness
[1637.50 → 1637.92] Or the
[1637.92 → 1639.64] I would say the lives to tape
[1639.64 → 1640.72] Rather than liveness
[1640.72 → 1641.78] Is more about
[1641.78 → 1642.62] Making sure
[1642.62 → 1643.60] That it's
[1643.60 → 1644.46] That it's really smooth
[1644.46 → 1645.28] And really clean
[1645.28 → 1646.34] And less about
[1646.34 → 1647.52] That they couldn't do it live
[1647.52 → 1648.40] If they really wanted to
[1648.40 → 1649.36] They clearly could
[1649.36 → 1650.06] Yeah yeah yeah
[1650.06 → 1650.96] That team
[1650.96 → 1652.36] Was so pro
[1652.36 → 1653.30] We'll get to that
[1653.30 → 1653.88] In a second though
[1653.88 → 1654.20] So anyway
[1654.20 → 1655.00] They basically gave me
[1655.00 → 1655.50] The green light
[1655.50 → 1656.40] We figured out
[1656.40 → 1657.10] The travel arrangements
[1657.10 → 1658.38] I promised myself
[1658.38 → 1658.80] Do you remember
[1658.80 → 1659.36] When this happened
[1659.36 → 1661.20] I promised myself
[1661.20 → 1661.74] Like
[1661.74 → 1663.58] Nine years ago
[1663.58 → 1664.66] Ten years ago
[1664.66 → 1665.96] That I would never
[1665.96 → 1667.06] Do a trip immediately
[1667.06 → 1668.00] After CES again
[1668.00 → 1668.74] I'm
[1668.74 → 1669.64] Yeah
[1669.64 → 1670.22] Do you remember
[1670.22 → 1670.98] When I did that
[1670.98 → 1672.90] No, but I'm pretty sure
[1672.90 → 1673.46] We've talked about it
[1673.46 → 1674.58] I was at CES
[1674.58 → 1675.84] And Ford reached out
[1675.84 → 1676.98] Wanting to sponsor a trip
[1676.98 → 1677.52] To the New York
[1677.52 → 1678.54] International Auto Show
[1678.54 → 1680.54] I literally came back
[1680.54 → 1681.32] From Las Vegas
[1681.32 → 1683.04] Had a meal with my family
[1683.04 → 1684.16] In the airport
[1684.16 → 1685.86] And then got on my plane
[1685.86 → 1686.70] Going to the next trip
[1686.70 → 1687.70] It was horrible
[1687.70 → 1688.80] And I told myself
[1688.80 → 1690.86] I would never do it again
[1690.86 → 1692.22] Well
[1692.22 → 1693.26] I did it again
[1693.26 → 1693.78] And
[1693.78 → 1696.36] I am so glad
[1696.36 → 1696.98] That I did
[1696.98 → 1698.40] Dude
[1698.40 → 1698.92] Okay
[1698.92 → 1700.14] So back to it
[1700.14 → 1700.92] Being different
[1700.92 → 1703.48] I've done live before
[1703.48 → 1705.58] I think the first time
[1705.58 → 1706.06] I ever
[1706.06 → 1707.80] Performed live
[1707.80 → 1708.80] And I don't mean
[1708.80 → 1709.28] Like when I was
[1709.28 → 1709.74] In a choir
[1709.74 → 1710.30] Recital
[1710.30 → 1710.80] When I was a kid
[1710.80 → 1711.12] Or whatever
[1711.12 → 1712.14] The first time
[1712.14 → 1712.88] I ever had to
[1712.88 → 1713.00] Like
[1713.00 → 1714.88] Work the crowd
[1714.88 → 1715.62] Was at the
[1715.62 → 1716.30] NCI
[1716.30 → 1717.44] Tech Fair
[1717.44 → 1718.50] At Aberdeen Mall
[1718.50 → 1718.92] That's the same
[1718.92 → 1719.44] What I was going to say
[1719.44 → 1719.80] Darn it
[1719.80 → 1721.24] So what happened then
[1721.24 → 1722.26] And this
[1722.26 → 1723.04] This is hilarious
[1723.04 → 1724.44] Was Microsoft
[1724.44 → 1725.10] I believe
[1725.10 → 1725.88] Was one of the
[1725.88 → 1726.64] Main sponsors
[1726.64 → 1727.40] Of the event
[1727.40 → 1728.92] But realistically
[1728.92 → 1729.84] Do you think
[1729.84 → 1730.94] Microsoft actually
[1730.94 → 1732.00] Has the time of day
[1732.00 → 1732.94] For it was like
[1732.94 → 1734.08] A weird little thing
[1734.08 → 1734.82] In the courtyard
[1734.82 → 1735.92] Of this mall
[1735.92 → 1736.86] Like a shopping mall
[1736.86 → 1737.34] It was odd
[1737.34 → 1738.64] They just set up
[1738.64 → 1739.32] Like tables
[1739.32 → 1740.34] And like down
[1740.34 → 1741.00] One of the hallways
[1741.00 → 1742.30] By the NCI store
[1742.30 → 1743.42] And then vendors
[1743.42 → 1744.02] Were just like
[1744.02 → 1746.08] Sitting behind their tables
[1746.08 → 1747.92] I
[1747.92 → 1748.86] I
[1748.86 → 1750.16] Whatever
[1750.16 → 1750.82] Like a couple
[1750.82 → 1751.28] I think like
[1751.28 → 1752.20] A couple case brands
[1752.20 → 1753.02] Had some cases
[1753.02 → 1753.60] On their tables
[1753.60 → 1753.88] And stuff
[1753.88 → 1754.88] But it was super weird
[1754.88 → 1755.34] Super bank
[1755.34 → 1755.54] Anyway
[1755.54 → 1756.20] Microsoft didn't have
[1756.20 → 1756.56] The time of day
[1756.56 → 1756.84] For this
[1756.84 → 1757.96] But they sponsored it
[1757.96 → 1758.96] Because the way
[1758.96 → 1760.34] That sponsorship dollars
[1760.34 → 1761.46] Work for retailers
[1761.46 → 1763.20] Is typically through MDF
[1763.20 → 1765.12] Or marketing development funds
[1765.12 → 1766.16] I think is what it's short for
[1766.16 → 1767.64] And essentially
[1767.64 → 1768.90] Rather than being
[1768.90 → 1769.50] A negotiation
[1769.50 → 1770.28] Where I go
[1770.28 → 1770.94] Hey Luke
[1770.94 → 1773.72] I want to do a video
[1773.72 → 1774.82] On your water bottle
[1774.82 → 1777.56] Give me some money
[1777.56 → 1778.78] And we'll do the video
[1778.78 → 1780.28] The way it actually works
[1780.28 → 1781.86] Is I'm a store
[1781.86 → 1783.62] And I sell these water bottles
[1783.62 → 1784.90] That Luke's company makes
[1784.90 → 1786.20] And a percentage
[1786.20 → 1787.68] Of my sales revenue
[1787.68 → 1789.62] Gets rebated back to me
[1789.62 → 1791.36] For approved marketing activities
[1791.36 → 1792.52] So realistically
[1792.52 → 1793.20] What happened
[1793.20 → 1794.08] Was NCI
[1794.08 → 1795.08] Was just looking for a way
[1795.08 → 1796.12] To spend some MDF
[1796.12 → 1797.72] And Microsoft was like
[1797.72 → 1798.20] Fine
[1798.20 → 1798.52] Screw it
[1798.52 → 1798.90] Who cares
[1798.90 → 1800.78] So we did this weird
[1800.78 → 1802.46] We did this weird
[1802.46 → 1804.52] Like tech expo thing
[1804.52 → 1805.36] In Aberdeen mall
[1805.36 → 1807.26] At some point
[1807.26 → 1807.82] They're like
[1807.82 → 1808.18] Hey
[1808.18 → 1809.94] We need you to go on the stage
[1809.94 → 1810.16] And do
[1810.16 → 1810.66] I think it was like
[1810.66 → 1811.12] A giveaway
[1811.12 → 1811.92] Or something
[1811.92 → 1814.02] I don't even remember
[1814.02 → 1814.76] What it was
[1814.76 → 1815.96] But it was one of the most
[1815.96 → 1816.92] Awkward things
[1816.92 → 1818.02] That I had ever done
[1818.02 → 1818.50] In my life
[1818.50 → 1818.72] Because
[1818.72 → 1819.54] A giveaway makes sense
[1819.54 → 1821.10] I had no idea
[1821.10 → 1822.44] What the point
[1822.44 → 1824.08] Of anything I was doing was
[1824.08 → 1826.22] I had no experience
[1826.22 → 1827.94] With like crowd work
[1827.94 → 1829.78] Or addressing a live audience
[1829.78 → 1831.52] It's really
[1831.52 → 1832.08] At that point
[1832.08 → 1833.40] I was already making videos
[1833.40 → 1834.10] I'm pretty sure
[1834.10 → 1834.26] Yeah
[1834.26 → 1835.14] Because Luke was in the picture
[1835.14 → 1835.74] So I was obvious
[1835.74 → 1836.58] I'd been making videos
[1836.58 → 1837.10] For a while
[1837.10 → 1838.84] But talking to a camera
[1838.84 → 1840.24] Is different
[1840.24 → 1842.22] I think
[1842.22 → 1842.96] That must have
[1842.96 → 1844.18] That must have been 2012
[1844.18 → 1845.28] I can
[1845.28 → 1846.60] I can
[1846.60 → 1848.02] Perform for the camera
[1848.02 → 1850.08] Without even thinking about it
[1850.08 → 1850.32] It's
[1850.32 → 1851.76] It's second nature to me now
[1851.76 → 1853.64] Live
[1853.64 → 1855.30] Is different
[1855.30 → 1856.60] Like when you make a joke
[1856.60 → 1857.08] Live
[1857.08 → 1857.92] Like I think
[1857.92 → 1859.54] The waif one
[1859.54 → 1860.66] Didn't land in person
[1860.66 → 1861.24] Oh bro
[1861.24 → 1862.80] No it didn't
[1862.80 → 1864.22] It landed in different ways
[1864.22 → 1865.98] That was so good
[1865.98 → 1868.76] The waif one
[1868.76 → 1869.88] Did not land in person
[1869.88 → 1870.20] Dude
[1870.20 → 1872.90] The kind of mortification
[1872.90 → 1874.12] That you feel like
[1874.12 → 1874.86] When a joke doesn't
[1874.86 → 1876.12] When a joke doesn't land
[1876.12 → 1876.64] With you guys
[1876.64 → 1877.16] It's just like
[1877.16 → 1877.80] I shake it off
[1877.80 → 1878.20] Yeah
[1878.20 → 1879.48] But the silence
[1879.48 → 1881.02] Is deafening
[1881.02 → 1883.02] It's deafening silence
[1883.02 → 1884.68] And I could tell
[1884.68 → 1885.52] Immediately
[1885.52 → 1886.80] That I did something wrong
[1886.80 → 1887.20] Not
[1887.20 → 1888.22] Not wrong
[1888.22 → 1889.98] Like they were mad at me
[1889.98 → 1890.66] Or anything wrong
[1890.66 → 1891.86] But when I was like
[1891.86 → 1893.26] I'm on real TV
[1893.26 → 1894.62] Do you know how many times
[1894.62 → 1895.80] Someone has probably said that
[1895.80 → 1896.26] On the show
[1896.26 → 1897.06] Oh tons
[1897.06 → 1898.40] For regular viewers
[1898.40 → 1899.54] Like come on
[1899.54 → 1901.50] I feel like that's like
[1901.50 → 1902.96] Man
[1902.96 → 1904.28] What would that
[1904.28 → 1905.42] What would that be like
[1905.42 → 1906.32] It'd be like
[1906.32 → 1907.26] Walking up to a
[1907.26 → 1908.50] To a beloved TV actor
[1908.50 → 1909.06] And asking them
[1909.06 → 1910.00] To do their catchphrase
[1910.00 → 1910.86] You know
[1910.86 → 1911.66] Like it's just
[1911.66 → 1912.44] Ugh
[1912.44 → 1913.28] Ugh
[1913.28 → 1913.84] It's played out
[1913.84 → 1915.00] So I did that
[1915.00 → 1915.94] Which immediately
[1915.94 → 1916.66] Got me all like
[1916.66 → 1917.46] Oh I did that
[1917.46 → 1918.00] I can't believe
[1918.00 → 1918.72] I did the thing
[1918.72 → 1920.24] And then
[1920.24 → 1920.88] You know
[1920.88 → 1921.36] Obviously
[1921.36 → 1922.44] I have some idea
[1922.44 → 1923.02] What they want
[1923.02 → 1924.14] To talk to me about
[1924.14 → 1925.98] But it is very much
[1925.98 → 1926.48] Uh
[1926.48 → 1927.84] And
[1927.84 → 1929.04] I have to say
[1929.04 → 1931.20] Fallon gets a really
[1931.20 → 1932.18] Bad rap
[1932.18 → 1933.30] For like
[1933.30 → 1933.76] I don't know
[1933.76 → 1934.70] Overreacting
[1934.70 → 1935.96] Or fake reacting
[1935.96 → 1936.46] To things
[1936.46 → 1937.86] Dude
[1937.86 → 1939.54] What are you talking about
[1939.54 → 1940.96] He actually
[1940.96 → 1942.08] They told me
[1942.08 → 1943.10] He went out of his way
[1943.10 → 1943.64] Because I
[1943.64 → 1944.94] I respectfully asked
[1944.94 → 1945.80] I said look
[1945.80 → 1947.68] I value genuineness
[1947.68 → 1949.10] In people's reactions
[1949.10 → 1949.68] To things
[1949.68 → 1952.54] I would respectfully ask
[1952.54 → 1953.58] That while you
[1953.58 → 1954.90] Explain everything
[1954.90 → 1955.66] So that he like
[1955.66 → 1955.98] You know
[1955.98 → 1957.02] Knows what it is
[1957.02 → 1958.00] That you not
[1958.00 → 1959.66] Have him put the glasses on
[1959.66 → 1961.28] Not show him the colour changing
[1961.28 → 1961.90] And
[1961.90 → 1962.08] And
[1962.08 → 1962.94] And have it be fresh
[1962.94 → 1963.16] Fresh
[1963.16 → 1963.48] Fresh
[1963.48 → 1965.34] And they're like
[1965.34 → 1965.58] Yeah
[1965.58 → 1966.92] Of course
[1966.92 → 1968.32] And you know
[1968.32 → 1969.12] What's funny is
[1969.12 → 1969.82] You know how
[1969.82 → 1971.38] Like he gets a bunch of flack
[1971.38 → 1972.32] Online for like
[1972.32 → 1973.90] Over laughing at things
[1973.90 → 1975.26] Sure
[1975.26 → 1975.62] Honestly
[1975.62 → 1976.34] I have no idea
[1976.34 → 1976.64] I don't
[1976.64 → 1977.32] I don't watch any
[1977.32 → 1977.98] Form of TV
[1977.98 → 1978.76] It's not
[1978.76 → 1979.08] It's not
[1979.08 → 1980.14] Against his show
[1980.14 → 1981.18] I don't watch any TV
[1981.18 → 1981.36] Yeah no
[1981.36 → 1982.78] Well he sometimes does
[1982.78 → 1983.44] Cause like I
[1983.44 → 1984.32] I kinda like
[1984.32 → 1984.88] Looked up
[1984.88 → 1985.14] You know
[1985.14 → 1986.06] What to expect
[1986.06 → 1986.46] You know
[1986.46 → 1986.90] From the connection
[1986.90 → 1987.96] Because I've watched clips
[1987.96 → 1988.54] From time to time
[1988.54 → 1989.28] But I also don't have
[1989.28 → 1990.02] A TV subscription
[1990.02 → 1991.44] So like I watch clips
[1991.44 → 1991.78] On YouTube
[1991.78 → 1992.10] Right
[1992.10 → 1992.52] Like that's
[1992.52 → 1993.12] That's about it
[1993.12 → 1993.82] And
[1993.82 → 1994.40] And
[1994.40 → 1994.96] And
[1994.96 → 1995.54] I was
[1995.54 → 1996.20] So I've read through
[1996.20 → 1996.76] A lot of the comments
[1996.76 → 1997.24] On ours
[1997.24 → 1998.20] And the flip side
[1998.20 → 1998.90] Is there's people saying
[1998.90 → 1999.94] He looked so uninterested
[1999.94 → 2000.76] No
[2000.76 → 2002.18] What he looked like to me
[2002.18 → 2003.12] As a person
[2003.12 → 2004.24] Who was actually there
[2004.24 → 2005.34] Who was actually
[2005.34 → 2006.12] Sitting on the couch
[2006.12 → 2006.78] Across from him
[2006.78 → 2008.22] Was someone who was
[2008.22 → 2009.06] Listening to me
[2009.06 → 2009.84] Talk about things
[2009.84 → 2011.58] And genuinely experiencing them
[2011.58 → 2013.48] I thought he was great
[2013.48 → 2014.60] And he was such
[2014.60 → 2015.00] Dude
[2015.00 → 2016.58] Bad Bunny
[2016.58 → 2017.58] Is the most
[2017.58 → 2019.18] Effortlessly cool person
[2019.18 → 2019.86] That I have
[2019.86 → 2020.62] Ever met
[2020.62 → 2022.30] No
[2022.30 → 2023.12] No
[2023.12 → 2023.96] I'm serious
[2023.96 → 2025.58] I barely even
[2025.58 → 2026.38] Interacted with him
[2026.38 → 2028.98] Did you see him
[2028.98 → 2029.74] Put on the glasses
[2029.74 → 2030.64] I swear to god
[2030.64 → 2031.32] That guy
[2031.32 → 2032.26] Could put on
[2032.26 → 2033.36] A milk crate
[2033.36 → 2035.36] And it would look cool
[2035.36 → 2036.66] Pull the
[2036.66 → 2037.32] What's her name
[2037.32 → 2038.04] She put on the
[2038.04 → 2038.80] Potato sack
[2038.80 → 2039.84] Sure
[2039.84 → 2040.26] Yeah
[2040.26 → 2041.42] In fact
[2041.42 → 2042.36] I bet a lot of people
[2042.36 → 2043.10] Didn't notice this
[2043.10 → 2043.92] But he was wearing
[2043.92 → 2044.78] For his belt
[2044.78 → 2045.56] He was wearing a rope
[2045.56 → 2046.64] Oh
[2046.64 → 2047.64] With his like
[2047.64 → 2048.76] Slick outfit
[2048.76 → 2049.90] He just had like
[2049.90 → 2050.70] A rope tied around
[2050.70 → 2051.16] His waist
[2051.16 → 2052.00] That's probably
[2052.00 → 2053.10] Some fashionable thing
[2053.10 → 2053.50] Because
[2053.50 → 2054.30] Because
[2054.30 → 2055.30] Because when you're
[2055.30 → 2055.98] That cool
[2055.98 → 2056.88] Anything you do
[2056.88 → 2057.34] Is cool
[2057.34 → 2058.22] Anything you touch
[2058.22 → 2058.66] Is cool
[2058.66 → 2059.42] And anything you say
[2059.42 → 2059.62] Is cool
[2059.62 → 2059.94] Also
[2059.94 → 2060.80] That was
[2060.80 → 2062.02] Hilarious
[2062.02 → 2062.92] When he was like
[2062.92 → 2063.34] Nudes
[2063.34 → 2064.64] Yeah
[2064.64 → 2065.88] Let me put it
[2065.88 → 2066.86] I was kind of surprised
[2066.86 → 2067.62] They left that in
[2067.62 → 2068.86] Let me put it this way sir
[2068.86 → 2071.06] You probably get nudes
[2071.06 → 2072.68] I don't
[2072.68 → 2075.00] Have you ever
[2075.00 → 2077.08] I have all my DMs
[2077.08 → 2077.46] Turned off
[2077.46 → 2078.36] Yeah so
[2078.36 → 2078.96] I don't know
[2078.96 → 2079.68] Maybe at some point
[2079.68 → 2080.34] But yeah
[2080.34 → 2081.50] There's no way
[2081.50 → 2081.84] That I
[2081.84 → 2082.38] There's no way
[2082.38 → 2082.70] That I
[2082.70 → 2083.08] Yeah
[2083.08 → 2084.12] Did bad bunny
[2084.12 → 2084.84] Steal the glasses
[2084.84 → 2085.18] I mean
[2085.18 → 2086.08] Come on guys
[2086.08 → 2086.96] He's a professional
[2086.96 → 2087.78] And do you think
[2087.78 → 2088.76] He can't afford glasses
[2088.76 → 2089.74] If he really wants them
[2089.74 → 2090.42] Like
[2090.42 → 2091.54] The brand
[2091.54 → 2093.14] Immediately responded
[2093.14 → 2093.68] Saying they would
[2093.68 → 2094.46] Send him glasses
[2094.46 → 2094.86] Like
[2094.86 → 2096.36] He doesn't need to do that
[2096.36 → 2097.04] Those
[2097.04 → 2097.78] Are
[2097.78 → 2098.44] Are pre
[2098.44 → 2099.66] Those are development
[2099.66 → 2100.26] Samples
[2100.26 → 2101.02] Probably
[2101.02 → 2102.74] Those
[2102.74 → 2103.30] Pretty cool
[2103.30 → 2103.82] They came back
[2103.82 → 2104.42] Have you seen them
[2104.42 → 2105.36] Not in person
[2105.36 → 2106.22] I never
[2106.22 → 2106.62] I had
[2106.62 → 2107.68] When you were talking
[2107.68 → 2108.68] About bringing out glasses
[2108.68 → 2109.76] I thought you were
[2109.76 → 2111.16] You were going to do
[2111.16 → 2111.64] The
[2111.64 → 2112.72] The screen ones
[2112.72 → 2113.90] Big screen beyond
[2113.90 → 2114.18] Or whatever
[2114.18 → 2115.12] Oh like a whole
[2115.12 → 2115.72] VR headset
[2115.72 → 2116.10] Yeah
[2116.10 → 2117.64] That's a lot of setup
[2117.64 → 2118.68] Here you go
[2118.68 → 2119.00] Okay
[2119.00 → 2119.90] Alright we're doing
[2119.90 → 2120.52] The demo again
[2120.52 → 2121.40] We're doing the demo again
[2121.40 → 2122.02] Let's go boys
[2122.02 → 2123.26] So how do I
[2123.26 → 2124.20] It's somewhere over here
[2124.20 → 2124.76] Yeah it's somewhere over there
[2124.76 → 2125.54] A little bit further back
[2125.54 → 2125.84] Oh
[2125.84 → 2126.56] Hey
[2126.56 → 2129.50] That is actually pretty wild
[2129.50 → 2130.04] While you're wearing it
[2130.04 → 2130.96] It's pretty cool right
[2130.96 → 2131.84] That's crazy
[2131.84 → 2133.18] We have a short
[2133.18 → 2134.96] I'm not sure if we've published it yet
[2134.96 → 2136.32] So you know how on the show
[2136.32 → 2137.30] He asked how it works
[2137.30 → 2137.80] And I was like
[2137.80 → 2138.84] That is pretty cool
[2138.84 → 2139.30] Magic
[2139.30 → 2140.26] Don't worry about it right
[2140.26 → 2141.50] Wow
[2141.50 → 2143.62] Whoops
[2143.62 → 2144.14] Whoops
[2144.14 → 2145.54] Okay I see how they charge too
[2145.54 → 2147.36] They're not that like bulky
[2147.36 → 2148.90] For having electronics in them
[2148.90 → 2150.14] No they're super cool
[2150.14 → 2150.44] Yeah
[2150.44 → 2152.00] So I know on the show
[2152.00 → 2152.30] We
[2152.30 → 2153.94] I kind of hand waved it away
[2153.94 → 2155.02] Because I knew my segment
[2155.02 → 2155.96] Wasn't super long
[2155.96 → 2157.42] And I was like
[2157.42 → 2158.10] Magic
[2158.10 → 2159.04] But
[2159.04 → 2161.10] We do know how they work
[2161.10 → 2162.56] And we shot a short
[2162.56 → 2163.74] When I got back
[2163.74 → 2165.38] That looks like it hasn't gone up yet
[2165.38 → 2166.80] But will be going up very soon
[2166.80 → 2167.58] Explaining
[2167.58 → 2169.14] Exactly how they work
[2169.14 → 2169.90] So stay tuned for that
[2169.90 → 2170.66] On the LTT channel
[2170.66 → 2172.16] They're super cool
[2172.16 → 2173.60] Man what else is there
[2173.60 → 2174.58] For me to talk about with it
[2174.58 → 2176.86] It was so surreal
[2176.86 → 2177.74] Like they did
[2177.74 → 2178.96] They did a walkthrough with me
[2178.96 → 2180.78] So that I'd be familiar with the
[2180.78 → 2181.94] Like the stage layout
[2181.94 → 2182.28] And stuff
[2182.28 → 2183.04] Like they wouldn't just
[2183.04 → 2184.70] Shove me out there
[2184.70 → 2185.14] And be like
[2185.14 → 2185.60] Go
[2185.60 → 2187.10] So they did a walkthrough
[2187.10 → 2188.32] Where they just had stand-ins
[2188.32 → 2189.20] At the desk
[2189.20 → 2190.16] For Bad Bunny and Jimmy
[2190.16 → 2191.52] And then they like
[2191.52 → 2192.48] Open the curtain
[2192.48 → 2192.82] And they say
[2192.82 → 2193.36] Okay go
[2193.36 → 2194.54] And so you know
[2194.54 → 2195.90] They show me how to do the walk-up
[2195.90 → 2196.38] And shake hands
[2196.38 → 2196.86] And shake hands
[2196.86 → 2197.38] And sit down
[2197.38 → 2198.40] Oh my god
[2198.40 → 2199.32] The way I sat down
[2199.32 → 2201.58] I was so awkward
[2201.58 → 2203.06] I don't even think I noticed
[2203.06 → 2204.10] And like I let my pants
[2204.10 → 2205.26] Get hiked up like this high
[2205.26 → 2206.02] I did notice that
[2206.02 → 2207.44] I thought that was on purpose
[2207.44 → 2207.84] No
[2207.84 → 2209.18] Okay question
[2209.18 → 2210.60] Were those darn tough socks
[2210.60 → 2211.40] Or did you sneak
[2211.40 → 2213.14] The LTT prototype socks on
[2213.14 → 2214.34] Almost everything
[2214.34 → 2215.40] On my person
[2215.40 → 2216.16] Was LTT
[2216.16 → 2217.24] Was I the only one
[2217.24 → 2217.98] That noticed the socks
[2217.98 → 2218.32] Nope
[2218.32 → 2219.10] Okay, okay
[2219.10 → 2219.78] No, no no
[2219.78 → 2220.78] The community loved it
[2220.78 → 2222.10] They saw the commuter bag
[2222.10 → 2223.08] You know what's funny
[2223.08 → 2224.22] I noticed the commuter bag for sure
[2224.22 → 2225.60] It was actually their team
[2225.60 → 2226.12] That was
[2226.12 → 2227.00] That kind of
[2227.00 → 2228.60] Hinted that
[2228.60 → 2229.54] Or that kind of
[2229.54 → 2231.46] Started the idea rolling
[2231.46 → 2232.98] That like I'd have a bag of tricks
[2232.98 → 2233.38] You know
[2233.38 → 2234.14] And I was like
[2234.14 → 2234.82] Oh that's perfect
[2234.82 → 2235.60] I have a backpack
[2235.60 → 2239.06] That works for me
[2239.06 → 2239.68] And to be clear
[2239.68 → 2241.08] I fully disclosed to them
[2241.08 → 2242.40] Like that it was
[2242.40 → 2243.18] My backpack
[2243.18 → 2243.60] Sure yeah
[2243.60 → 2245.24] And I saw a lot of people
[2245.24 → 2246.24] Speculating that
[2246.24 → 2247.10] Oh they
[2247.10 → 2248.24] They wouldn't have
[2248.24 → 2249.08] They wouldn't let him
[2249.08 → 2249.96] Say LTT store
[2249.96 → 2250.76] Or they wouldn't let him
[2250.76 → 2251.54] Pimp it or whatever
[2251.54 → 2253.00] That did not happen
[2253.00 → 2253.62] I didn't get that
[2253.62 → 2255.42] I could not say
[2255.42 → 2256.66] A negative word
[2256.66 → 2258.16] About the tonight show team
[2258.16 → 2259.94] If I tried
[2259.94 → 2260.46] That's cool
[2260.46 → 2261.78] They were professional
[2261.78 → 2263.22] Responsive
[2263.22 → 2264.78] So accommodating
[2264.78 → 2265.32] I mean I guess
[2265.32 → 2266.54] They have to be used to like
[2266.54 → 2268.50] Actual famous people
[2268.50 → 2269.66] And stars and stuff
[2269.66 → 2271.96] Or is it
[2271.96 → 2273.44] They're like tripping over themselves
[2273.44 → 2274.98] Like can we bring you one of these
[2274.98 → 2275.92] Can we get you some of this
[2275.92 → 2276.52] Are you comfortable
[2276.52 → 2276.84] Are you that
[2276.84 → 2277.14] I'm like
[2277.14 → 2278.92] I'm good
[2278.92 → 2280.02] They're like can we close the door
[2280.02 → 2280.82] Of your green room
[2280.82 → 2281.20] I'm like
[2281.20 → 2283.02] I mean the door's right there
[2283.02 → 2283.66] I could close it up
[2283.66 → 2284.02] Yeah
[2284.02 → 2284.10] Yeah
[2284.10 → 2286.12] Like they were
[2286.12 → 2286.64] They were
[2286.64 → 2287.66] So
[2287.66 → 2289.28] So accommodating
[2289.28 → 2291.94] Loved me
[2291.94 → 2292.22] Oh
[2292.22 → 2293.46] Here's another thing
[2293.46 → 2294.16] That I think people
[2294.16 → 2295.66] Don't necessarily appreciate
[2295.66 → 2296.18] About
[2296.18 → 2298.22] S tier personalities
[2298.22 → 2298.60] Like
[2298.60 → 2301.22] I consider myself
[2301.22 → 2302.50] An tier
[2302.50 → 2303.26] Personality
[2303.26 → 2303.78] I think I'm
[2303.78 → 2304.88] I think I'm pretty darn good
[2304.88 → 2305.42] On camera
[2305.42 → 2306.08] For the most part
[2306.08 → 2306.86] I screw up sometimes
[2306.86 → 2307.08] And
[2307.08 → 2309.10] You guys could obviously tell
[2309.10 → 2310.08] I was pretty nervous
[2310.08 → 2311.50] On the tonight show segment
[2311.50 → 2312.24] For the first part
[2312.24 → 2314.08] I said this in the pre-show
[2314.08 → 2314.84] And you told me to shut up
[2314.84 → 2315.32] Which is fair
[2315.32 → 2315.96] Because this
[2315.96 → 2316.94] Should have held it
[2316.94 → 2317.54] For this segment
[2317.54 → 2317.90] But
[2317.90 → 2318.82] Yeah
[2318.82 → 2320.00] Absolutely
[2320.00 → 2321.48] You did lock in though
[2321.48 → 2322.26] I had
[2322.26 → 2323.16] The whole time you were
[2323.16 → 2323.92] Sitting there talking
[2323.92 → 2324.40] I was like
[2324.40 → 2325.16] Man stop
[2325.16 → 2326.46] Like stop talking
[2326.46 → 2327.60] About yourself
[2327.60 → 2328.78] And start talking
[2328.78 → 2329.62] About tech crap
[2329.62 → 2329.96] I know
[2329.96 → 2330.60] Because the second
[2330.60 → 2331.10] You start talking
[2331.10 → 2331.70] About tech crap
[2331.70 → 2332.46] You'll be fine
[2332.46 → 2333.64] And then you finally did
[2333.64 → 2334.76] And immediately locked in
[2334.76 → 2335.02] I was like
[2335.02 → 2335.80] Ah we're good
[2335.80 → 2337.32] That's my boy
[2337.32 → 2337.80] Yeah
[2337.80 → 2339.64] So he's got it man
[2339.64 → 2340.14] Yeah
[2340.14 → 2341.74] Jaden's in chat
[2341.74 → 2343.44] Linus seemed so nervous
[2343.44 → 2344.76] I know him IRL
[2344.76 → 2345.40] Duh
[2345.40 → 2347.02] And it was so weird
[2347.02 → 2348.06] To see him like that
[2348.06 → 2349.26] It was endearing though
[2349.26 → 2350.28] Thanks Jaden
[2350.28 → 2353.04] You did totally lock in though
[2353.04 → 2353.54] Oh
[2353.54 → 2354.96] Thank you
[2354.96 → 2355.82] Thank you
[2355.82 → 2357.22] Yeah
[2357.22 → 2360.04] J2134 in flow plane chat
[2360.04 → 2361.34] Said the lock in was crazy
[2361.34 → 2361.86] But yeah
[2361.86 → 2362.22] But
[2362.22 → 2362.82] Okay
[2362.82 → 2363.68] Jimmy
[2363.68 → 2365.30] S tier
[2365.30 → 2365.80] Right
[2365.80 → 2366.46] Like
[2366.46 → 2367.40] Ludwig
[2367.40 → 2368.42] S tier
[2368.42 → 2368.98] You know
[2368.98 → 2369.98] You encounter people
[2369.98 → 2370.46] That
[2370.46 → 2371.06] You just
[2371.06 → 2371.54] You look at
[2371.54 → 2371.98] And you go
[2371.98 → 2372.98] I could practice
[2372.98 → 2373.80] My whole life
[2373.80 → 2375.38] And I will never
[2375.38 → 2376.44] Make it look as easy
[2376.44 → 2376.96] As you do
[2376.96 → 2378.06] Like the
[2378.06 → 2378.56] The whole
[2378.56 → 2379.14] The whole
[2379.14 → 2380.12] Dick joke thing
[2380.12 → 2380.84] With the laptop
[2380.84 → 2382.84] Do you not think
[2382.84 → 2383.70] He knew
[2383.70 → 2383.98] Where
[2383.98 → 2384.66] He knew
[2384.66 → 2385.50] Something was coming
[2385.50 → 2386.52] I mean
[2386.52 → 2387.38] How
[2387.38 → 2388.58] Maybe not that
[2388.58 → 2389.90] Maybe not that
[2389.90 → 2391.30] But there's no way
[2391.30 → 2392.18] That he didn't know
[2392.18 → 2393.14] Something's coming
[2393.14 → 2393.42] Right
[2393.42 → 2394.54] The way I set it up
[2394.54 → 2395.18] And I'm like
[2395.18 → 2396.66] And I'm like
[2396.66 → 2397.66] Ooh
[2397.66 → 2398.84] A laptop
[2398.84 → 2401.98] I was a little concerned
[2401.98 → 2402.46] When you did that
[2402.46 → 2402.98] Not going to lie
[2402.98 → 2403.92] That's good
[2403.92 → 2404.52] And then it worked out great
[2404.52 → 2404.94] Then that means
[2404.94 → 2406.04] I did good
[2406.04 → 2406.84] That means I did good
[2406.84 → 2407.44] Anyway
[2407.44 → 2409.04] The guy's such a pro
[2409.04 → 2409.80] He just
[2409.80 → 2411.06] He walked into it for me
[2411.06 → 2411.98] You know
[2411.98 → 2412.26] Like
[2412.26 → 2412.78] Yeah yeah yeah
[2412.78 → 2413.50] He
[2413.50 → 2415.16] When he needed to talk
[2415.16 → 2415.98] To help
[2415.98 → 2416.92] You know
[2416.92 → 2417.86] Slow me down
[2417.86 → 2419.40] Or calm my nerves
[2419.40 → 2420.84] Or just get us to move on
[2420.84 → 2421.54] When I'm being boring
[2421.54 → 2422.94] He did it
[2422.94 → 2423.44] Gently
[2423.44 → 2424.64] He was a good orchestrator
[2424.64 → 2425.12] Yes
[2425.12 → 2425.60] Yeah yeah yeah
[2425.60 → 2426.38] And when it was time
[2426.38 → 2427.30] To let me talk
[2427.30 → 2429.38] And respond sparingly
[2429.38 → 2430.42] He did that
[2430.42 → 2431.00] He did that
[2431.00 → 2431.48] Yeah yeah yeah
[2431.48 → 2432.82] So I
[2432.82 → 2433.22] Dude
[2433.22 → 2433.64] I
[2433.64 → 2434.26] I
[2434.26 → 2435.30] I had
[2435.30 → 2436.66] I had a heck of a time
[2436.66 → 2437.52] I met him for like
[2437.52 → 2438.98] Five minutes
[2438.98 → 2440.02] Before the show
[2440.02 → 2440.62] And
[2440.62 → 2442.32] And oh
[2442.32 → 2442.72] I was
[2442.72 → 2443.46] I was so stoked
[2443.46 → 2443.86] Because
[2443.86 → 2445.68] I feel like
[2445.68 → 2446.82] Production teams
[2446.82 → 2448.08] Can be very protective
[2448.08 → 2448.70] Of their talent
[2448.70 → 2449.34] Sure
[2449.34 → 2449.80] And they
[2449.80 → 2450.58] And they should be
[2450.58 → 2450.96] Right
[2450.96 → 2451.48] Because that
[2451.48 → 2452.66] The entire show
[2452.66 → 2453.58] Rides on the talent
[2453.58 → 2454.66] Delivering
[2454.66 → 2455.94] Night after night
[2455.94 → 2456.50] You know
[2456.50 → 2456.88] So they can
[2456.88 → 2457.72] They can be very protective
[2457.72 → 2459.04] So when I said
[2459.04 → 2461.00] When they told me
[2461.00 → 2461.94] Jimmy's favourite game
[2461.94 → 2463.22] Because they kind of
[2463.22 → 2463.92] Wanted the game
[2463.92 → 2464.52] On the
[2464.52 → 2466.76] On the X-Rail glasses
[2466.76 → 2467.68] To be something
[2467.68 → 2468.26] That he was deeply
[2468.26 → 2468.90] Familiar with
[2468.90 → 2471.02] They told me
[2471.02 → 2471.46] It's Zelda
[2471.46 → 2472.60] Yeah
[2472.60 → 2473.40] My relationship
[2473.40 → 2474.16] With Nintendo
[2474.16 → 2476.36] My confidence
[2476.36 → 2477.94] That I could go on
[2477.94 → 2478.74] Network
[2478.74 → 2479.14] Or sorry
[2479.14 → 2480.32] Not network
[2480.32 → 2482.14] Broadcast
[2482.14 → 2483.22] Broadcast TV
[2483.22 → 2483.88] What's the difference?
[2484.04 → 2484.54] I forget
[2484.54 → 2485.54] But there's a difference
[2485.54 → 2486.46] One's free
[2486.46 → 2487.02] One's something
[2487.02 → 2488.06] Whatever
[2488.06 → 2489.58] Go on TV
[2489.58 → 2490.00] Okay
[2490.00 → 2491.64] And use
[2491.64 → 2492.90] Nintendo gameplay
[2492.90 → 2494.56] My confidence level
[2494.56 → 2496.26] Pretty low
[2496.26 → 2497.48] So I'm sitting there
[2497.48 → 2499.00] I'm racking my brain
[2499.00 → 2500.42] I look down
[2500.42 → 2501.36] And I see my
[2501.36 → 2502.18] What would Luke do
[2502.18 → 2502.74] Bracelet
[2502.74 → 2505.46] And I was like
[2505.46 → 2508.10] How did I not think
[2508.10 → 2509.22] To just give him
[2509.22 → 2510.10] Baldur's Gate 3
[2510.10 → 2512.20] Same control schema
[2512.20 → 2512.78] Because all I needed
[2512.78 → 2513.02] To do
[2513.02 → 2513.40] Him to do
[2513.40 → 2513.94] Was walked around
[2513.94 → 2514.34] A little bit
[2514.34 → 2514.82] And just be like
[2514.82 → 2515.18] Whoa
[2515.18 → 2517.16] He had 162 inch
[2517.16 → 2518.04] Screen in front of him
[2518.04 → 2518.54] Right
[2518.54 → 2519.60] That's all I needed
[2519.60 → 2520.22] Him to do
[2520.22 → 2521.46] So all I did
[2521.46 → 2522.22] So in the pre-show
[2522.22 → 2523.14] So in the pre-brief
[2523.14 → 2523.68] I was like
[2523.68 → 2524.10] Okay look
[2524.10 → 2524.78] Your team
[2524.78 → 2525.18] Like
[2525.18 → 2526.88] Your team's like
[2526.88 → 2527.06] Oh
[2527.06 → 2528.16] Make sure that you
[2528.16 → 2528.54] You know
[2528.54 → 2529.78] Go through
[2529.78 → 2530.24] This
[2530.24 → 2530.78] I'm like
[2530.78 → 2531.38] Okay
[2531.38 → 2532.00] So it uses
[2532.00 → 2533.64] Standard dual stick control
[2533.64 → 2533.94] He's like
[2533.94 → 2534.44] Okay yeah
[2534.44 → 2535.04] Yeah
[2535.04 → 2536.46] He'll be fine
[2536.46 → 2536.74] Yeah
[2536.74 → 2536.98] Yeah
[2536.98 → 2538.10] Ah dude
[2538.10 → 2538.44] He would
[2538.44 → 2538.84] I don't know
[2538.84 → 2539.12] He was
[2539.12 → 2539.76] He was super cool
[2539.76 → 2540.30] Yeah and you didn't need
[2540.30 → 2540.88] Like he didn't need
[2540.88 → 2541.60] To get in a fight
[2541.60 → 2542.00] Or anything
[2542.00 → 2543.04] He just needs to see
[2543.04 → 2543.68] That he could see
[2543.68 → 2544.86] The screen in his glasses
[2544.86 → 2545.50] That was all that
[2545.50 → 2546.24] Really needed to have
[2546.24 → 2546.40] Yeah
[2546.40 → 2546.84] And
[2546.84 → 2547.52] And
[2547.52 → 2550.46] And I was very sure
[2550.46 → 2551.04] That Marian
[2551.04 → 2552.06] Wouldn't go after us
[2552.06 → 2552.28] So
[2552.28 → 2554.74] That was one of the other reasons
[2554.74 → 2557.02] That I went with that
[2557.02 → 2558.24] Yeah they're pretty chill
[2558.24 → 2559.62] Anyway yeah
[2559.62 → 2560.58] They made the experience
[2560.58 → 2562.24] Completely unforgettable for me
[2562.24 → 2563.60] I shared them with Luke
[2563.60 → 2565.08] But they are technically
[2565.08 → 2566.46] Not for commercial use
[2566.46 → 2567.52] So I'm not going to put them
[2567.52 → 2568.56] On the show right now
[2568.56 → 2569.70] But they sent over
[2569.70 → 2570.74] A nice little photo album
[2570.74 → 2571.16] For me
[2571.16 → 2571.76] Oh yeah
[2571.76 → 2572.44] That included
[2572.44 → 2574.56] Like a cool black and white shot
[2574.56 → 2575.04] Those were cool
[2575.04 → 2576.50] Of the back of Jimmy's head
[2576.50 → 2578.04] And me standing in the green room
[2578.04 → 2578.98] Shaking his hand
[2578.98 → 2581.26] And like a nice wide
[2581.26 → 2582.76] Of me on the set
[2582.76 → 2583.86] During the show
[2583.86 → 2584.96] And the big tonight show
[2584.96 → 2585.80] Logo and stuff
[2585.80 → 2586.82] That was genuinely
[2586.82 → 2587.46] Very cool yeah
[2587.46 → 2589.58] It was really different
[2589.58 → 2590.80] I've never really done
[2590.80 → 2592.10] Traditional media before
[2592.10 → 2592.28] Oh what
[2592.28 → 2592.86] I didn't know that
[2592.86 → 2593.46] What's up
[2593.46 → 2595.56] Sven the CEO of Marian
[2595.56 → 2596.72] Apparently tweeted the clip out
[2596.72 → 2598.18] Oh that's super cool
[2598.18 → 2600.48] Of course he did
[2600.48 → 2601.86] So I want to talk
[2601.86 → 2603.84] I wanna talk about
[2603.84 → 2605.04] The
[2605.04 → 2606.88] The difference
[2606.88 → 2608.78] Between a view on TV
[2608.78 → 2610.42] And a view on YouTube
[2610.42 → 2611.80] Because I have to say
[2611.80 → 2612.92] On the one hand
[2612.92 → 2614.04] I am so
[2614.04 → 2615.42] I was so excited
[2615.42 → 2616.72] Like elated
[2616.72 → 2618.36] To have this experience
[2618.36 → 2619.64] And to get to do this
[2619.64 → 2621.60] And to have it be so cool
[2621.60 → 2622.48] For me personally
[2622.48 → 2624.34] But on the other hand
[2624.34 → 2625.62] A small part of me
[2625.62 → 2626.66] Couldn't help being like
[2626.66 → 2628.34] Okay why isn't everybody
[2628.34 → 2629.60] This excited and impressed
[2629.60 → 2630.82] When we get 5 million views
[2630.82 → 2632.04] Like all the time
[2632.04 → 2633.64] Right like
[2633.64 → 2634.46] Why isn't that
[2634.46 → 2635.64] Well I think it was comparative
[2635.64 → 2636.66] Cause you look at
[2636.66 → 2638.22] Like they upload a lot
[2638.22 → 2638.84] To that channel
[2638.84 → 2639.38] No, no no, no
[2639.38 → 2640.30] I don't mean that
[2640.30 → 2641.76] I mean like on LTT
[2641.76 → 2643.70] On a very regular basis
[2643.70 → 2644.66] We upload a video
[2644.66 → 2645.94] That gets a couple million views
[2645.94 → 2646.24] Yeah
[2646.24 → 2647.76] I don't have people
[2647.76 → 2649.64] Crawling out of the woodwork
[2649.64 → 2651.78] From all parts of my past
[2651.78 → 2652.58] Being like
[2652.58 → 2653.56] Yo I saw you
[2653.56 → 2655.10] I saw you on Fallon
[2655.10 → 2656.82] But that's the thing
[2656.82 → 2658.24] Is even though
[2658.24 → 2659.32] It's only
[2659.32 → 2660.44] Because I saw a lot of people
[2660.44 → 2660.92] Being like
[2660.92 → 2661.76] Oh it was so
[2661.76 → 2663.16] It was so gracious of Linus
[2663.16 → 2664.54] To support up-and-coming creators
[2664.54 → 2665.42] Like Jimmy Fallon
[2665.42 → 2666.98] Which is a meme
[2666.98 → 2667.54] It's a meme
[2667.54 → 2668.46] It's a meme format
[2668.46 → 2670.08] Like they don't mean any disrespect
[2670.08 → 2672.72] And while you know
[2672.72 → 2674.60] We get a lot of views and stuff
[2674.60 → 2676.22] What I've discovered
[2676.22 → 2677.60] Is that even
[2677.60 → 2678.80] Even though
[2678.80 → 2679.60] Obviously
[2679.60 → 2680.02] I'm
[2680.02 → 2681.00] I'm new media
[2681.00 → 2682.18] In and out
[2682.18 → 2683.64] All the way through
[2683.64 → 2684.30] To my core
[2684.30 → 2684.82] Yeah
[2684.82 → 2686.94] A view on traditional media
[2686.94 → 2689.18] Just plain isn't the same
[2689.18 → 2690.86] As a view on new media
[2690.86 → 2693.18] It just plain doesn't hit as hard
[2693.18 → 2694.20] Whether it's the
[2694.20 → 2695.66] Kind of the glamour
[2695.66 → 2696.34] And the spectacle
[2696.34 → 2698.24] Whether it's the polished ness
[2698.24 → 2699.20] Of the production
[2699.20 → 2700.56] Whether it's the
[2700.56 → 2700.98] Just
[2700.98 → 2702.44] Whether it's just the perception
[2702.44 → 2703.60] Dude
[2703.60 → 2704.44] Everyone
[2704.44 → 2705.92] And their dog
[2705.92 → 2707.48] Reached out to me about it
[2707.48 → 2708.00] Like
[2708.00 → 2709.18] People I haven't talked to
[2709.18 → 2710.08] In years
[2710.08 → 2711.28] People Yvonne
[2711.28 → 2712.20] Hadn't talked to
[2712.20 → 2713.06] In years
[2713.06 → 2714.12] Were reaching out to her
[2714.12 → 2714.52] Being like
[2714.52 → 2714.92] Yo
[2714.92 → 2716.56] I saw Linus on Fallon
[2716.56 → 2717.74] There's definitely
[2717.74 → 2718.02] Yeah
[2718.02 → 2718.70] There's definitely
[2718.70 → 2719.90] A prestige
[2719.90 → 2721.22] Perspective on it
[2721.22 → 2721.60] Yeah
[2721.60 → 2722.72] And you know what
[2722.72 → 2723.96] When I was there
[2723.96 → 2725.36] Sitting in the studio
[2725.36 → 2726.00] You got it
[2726.00 → 2726.62] You got the vibe
[2726.62 → 2727.02] Seeing the production
[2727.02 → 2727.98] It's a vibe
[2727.98 → 2729.00] It's a vibe
[2729.00 → 2729.86] It was so
[2729.86 → 2730.60] Cool
[2730.60 → 2734.56] Let me see what else
[2734.56 → 2734.88] I've got
[2734.88 → 2736.14] Oh Sammy has some notes
[2736.14 → 2736.64] On the experience
[2736.64 → 2737.62] So this is great
[2737.62 → 2739.16] If you guys are
[2739.16 → 2739.82] Hold on a second
[2739.82 → 2740.30] I'm just gonna
[2740.30 → 2741.76] Yeah
[2741.76 → 2742.88] Open this in a new tab
[2742.88 → 2743.88] If you guys are
[2743.88 → 2745.12] Subscribed to Float plane
[2745.12 → 2747.52] Sammy actually came with me
[2747.52 → 2747.92] On the trip
[2747.92 → 2748.20] Yeah
[2748.20 → 2749.38] For the express purpose
[2749.38 → 2750.50] Of creating this
[2750.50 → 2751.90] Behind the scenes vlog
[2751.90 → 2753.38] Of getting to
[2753.38 → 2755.20] And appearing
[2755.20 → 2756.88] On the tonight show
[2756.88 → 2757.62] So if you guys
[2757.62 → 2758.56] Want to check that out
[2758.56 → 2759.62] Sammy came along
[2759.62 → 2760.26] For the ride
[2760.26 → 2760.72] And he actually
[2760.72 → 2761.26] Has some notes
[2761.26 → 2761.94] In here as well
[2761.94 → 2763.36] He says
[2763.36 → 2764.50] Oh nope
[2764.50 → 2765.06] Nope that one
[2765.06 → 2766.34] He says
[2766.34 → 2766.90] Bringing Yvonne
[2766.90 → 2767.70] Was an excellent call
[2767.70 → 2769.10] I actually wasn't
[2769.10 → 2769.66] Going to bring her
[2769.66 → 2770.56] Until five hours
[2770.56 → 2771.58] Before my departure
[2771.58 → 2772.50] Why?
[2772.82 → 2773.56] Well because
[2773.56 → 2774.30] She has
[2774.30 → 2775.14] We have a lot of stuff
[2775.14 → 2775.92] Going on with the kids
[2775.92 → 2776.24] Yeah but
[2776.24 → 2777.58] I'm assuming she wanted
[2777.58 → 2777.80] To go
[2777.80 → 2778.48] We have a life
[2778.48 → 2780.34] She wanted to
[2780.34 → 2781.46] Be supportive
[2781.46 → 2783.52] You know how she is
[2783.52 → 2785.18] She wants to be there
[2785.18 → 2786.44] Doing whatever is
[2786.44 → 2787.70] The single
[2787.70 → 2788.64] Most productive
[2788.64 → 2789.80] Useful
[2789.80 → 2790.72] Thing
[2790.72 → 2791.70] That makes sense
[2791.70 → 2792.40] She puts aside
[2792.40 → 2793.12] A lot of her own
[2793.12 → 2793.86] Feelings to do
[2793.86 → 2794.74] The right thing
[2794.74 → 2797.08] To drive things
[2797.08 → 2797.42] Forward
[2797.42 → 2798.30] And so
[2798.30 → 2799.56] If the right thing
[2799.56 → 2801.10] Was to make sure
[2801.10 → 2802.46] That you know
[2802.46 → 2803.28] The kids all get
[2803.28 → 2803.90] To their stuff
[2803.90 → 2804.88] And whatever else
[2804.88 → 2806.24] She was down to do that
[2806.24 → 2807.12] And watch from home
[2807.12 → 2808.14] If the right thing
[2808.14 → 2808.90] Was to make sure
[2808.90 → 2810.08] That I don't blow
[2810.08 → 2811.68] A flipping gasket
[2811.68 → 2813.42] Freaking out about
[2813.42 → 2813.96] This thing
[2813.96 → 2815.12] Then she was down
[2815.12 → 2815.96] To come with me
[2815.96 → 2817.36] And Sammy said
[2817.36 → 2818.02] Bringing Yvonne
[2818.02 → 2819.50] Was an excellent call
[2819.50 → 2820.82] A lot of praise
[2820.82 → 2821.26] Warranted
[2821.26 → 2822.88] Has that bolded
[2822.88 → 2824.30] For keeping your nerves
[2824.30 → 2826.04] For keeping your nerves
[2826.04 → 2827.72] Like 5%
[2827.72 → 2828.72] Was caught on camera
[2828.72 → 2829.66] In terms of nervousness
[2829.66 → 2830.10] And Yvonne
[2830.10 → 2831.36] Making you calm down
[2831.36 → 2833.06] If it was just you and me
[2833.06 → 2834.10] All I would have been able
[2834.10 → 2834.62] To do is
[2834.62 → 2835.90] Give you a thumbs up
[2835.90 → 2837.00] And say you got this
[2837.00 → 2837.78] And the shoot
[2837.78 → 2838.66] Potentially would have
[2838.66 → 2839.64] Gone way worse
[2839.64 → 2846.02] All right
[2846.02 → 2848.10] Merch plug missing
[2848.10 → 2848.50] How do
[2848.50 → 2849.24] Oh yeah
[2849.24 → 2849.58] Man
[2849.58 → 2850.94] I have to
[2850.94 → 2851.58] Can I
[2851.58 → 2853.08] Can I please
[2853.08 → 2853.56] For the
[2853.56 → 2854.98] Maybe the final time
[2854.98 → 2856.52] Ask the community
[2856.52 → 2858.00] Not to speculate
[2858.00 → 2859.10] Speculation
[2859.78 → 2860.88] Is bad
[2860.88 → 2862.38] It's bad
[2862.38 → 2863.48] And if you don't know
[2863.48 → 2864.84] Don't say anything
[2864.84 → 2866.92] X-Rail is using footage
[2866.92 → 2867.50] From Linus on the
[2867.50 → 2867.82] Tonight Show
[2867.82 → 2868.34] And their ads
[2868.34 → 2869.22] Not saying this is
[2869.22 → 2869.64] Good or bad
[2869.64 → 2870.24] Just notice it
[2870.24 → 2870.70] While scrolling
[2870.70 → 2871.30] It's great promotional
[2871.30 → 2872.00] Content for the glasses
[2872.00 → 2872.44] So it makes sense
[2872.44 → 2872.86] To use it
[2872.86 → 2873.68] Quite honestly
[2873.68 → 2874.78] I won't be surprised
[2874.78 → 2875.62] If the items he chose
[2875.62 → 2876.26] To take to the show
[2876.26 → 2876.70] Are sponsors
[2876.70 → 2878.20] That's exactly how it works
[2878.20 → 2879.78] No
[2879.78 → 2881.58] It isn't
[2881.58 → 2884.08] If you don't know
[2884.08 → 2886.26] Don't say anything
[2886.26 → 2887.00] And that's actually
[2887.00 → 2887.88] Not our footage
[2887.88 → 2888.96] Yeah
[2888.96 → 2889.90] That I don't know
[2889.90 → 2890.50] Anything about that
[2890.50 → 2890.74] But
[2890.74 → 2891.92] Whether they
[2891.92 → 2892.84] It's their footage
[2892.84 → 2893.30] Yeah whether they
[2893.30 → 2894.12] Have the rights or not
[2894.12 → 2894.74] X-Rail wise
[2894.74 → 2895.62] That I don't know
[2895.62 → 2896.60] I know nothing about that
[2896.60 → 2897.92] What I do know
[2897.92 → 2899.14] Is that X-Rail
[2899.14 → 2900.02] Did not give us
[2900.02 → 2901.14] A dime
[2901.14 → 2902.16] For the appearance
[2902.16 → 2902.82] What happened
[2902.82 → 2904.40] Was we got the call
[2904.40 → 2904.90] On Wednesday
[2904.90 → 2905.92] And we went
[2905.92 → 2908.14] Holy capsules
[2908.14 → 2909.36] Just for reference
[2909.36 → 2910.92] CES functionally
[2910.92 → 2912.20] Closes on Thursday
[2912.20 → 2913.34] So
[2913.34 → 2915.48] So we got the call
[2915.48 → 2916.64] We went
[2916.64 → 2918.14] Holy capsules
[2918.14 → 2918.96] We spent the rest
[2918.96 → 2919.66] Of Wednesday
[2919.66 → 2921.22] Deciding to do it
[2921.22 → 2922.30] And then compiling
[2922.30 → 2922.84] A hit list
[2922.84 → 2923.88] And then on
[2923.88 → 2925.10] There were
[2925.10 → 2925.80] There were multiple
[2925.80 → 2926.76] Options for the segment
[2926.76 → 2928.36] There was a possibility
[2928.36 → 2929.10] That if we didn't
[2929.10 → 2929.68] Find anything
[2929.68 → 2931.36] I would have sat
[2931.36 → 2931.92] On the couch
[2931.92 → 2933.68] Done a terrible segment
[2933.68 → 2934.68] And
[2934.68 → 2935.94] Never been invited
[2935.94 → 2936.96] To TV ever again
[2936.96 → 2938.22] But
[2938.22 → 2939.86] I wanted to go
[2939.86 → 2940.64] For gold on this
[2940.64 → 2941.06] Because I was
[2941.06 → 2942.00] Pretty excited about it
[2942.00 → 2942.32] I mean it's
[2942.32 → 2943.04] It's a cool
[2943.04 → 2944.50] It's a cool milestone
[2944.50 → 2945.30] Even if it only
[2945.30 → 2945.88] Happens once
[2945.88 → 2946.28] You might as well
[2946.28 → 2946.50] Send it
[2946.50 → 2947.22] And, so I told them
[2947.22 → 2947.44] Look
[2947.44 → 2948.66] I told the team
[2948.66 → 2948.90] Look
[2948.90 → 2949.76] Here's what we
[2949.76 → 2950.38] Should try to do
[2950.38 → 2951.42] We should try to
[2951.42 → 2952.22] Bring CES
[2952.22 → 2953.06] To the tonight show
[2953.06 → 2954.34] So we spent
[2954.34 → 2954.90] Thursday
[2954.90 → 2955.76] Part of the team
[2955.76 → 2957.04] Massive shout out
[2957.04 → 2957.56] Procurement
[2957.56 → 2958.64] Massive shout out
[2958.64 → 2959.90] The man in the chair
[2959.90 → 2960.78] James who was
[2960.78 → 2961.54] Coordinating a lot of
[2961.54 → 2962.12] CES stuff
[2962.12 → 2962.72] From back here
[2962.72 → 2963.32] At home base
[2963.32 → 2964.98] Massive shout out
[2964.98 → 2966.42] To the writing team
[2966.42 → 2967.02] That was actually
[2967.02 → 2967.76] At CES
[2967.76 → 2968.64] I hope I'm not
[2968.64 → 2969.30] Missing anybody
[2969.30 → 2970.50] But massive shout out
[2970.50 → 2971.16] Massive shout out
[2971.16 → 2971.58] To our team
[2971.58 → 2972.66] For getting that
[2972.66 → 2973.04] Together
[2973.04 → 2973.92] So fast
[2973.92 → 2974.60] So on Thursday
[2974.60 → 2975.62] We went around
[2975.62 → 2976.58] To our hit list items
[2976.58 → 2977.62] And we basically
[2977.62 → 2977.98] Were like
[2977.98 → 2978.26] Hey
[2978.26 → 2979.20] Here's the opportunity
[2979.20 → 2980.58] Nothing is guaranteed
[2980.58 → 2981.40] Because we have no
[2981.40 → 2982.24] We're going to pitch it
[2982.24 → 2983.16] It may or may not
[2983.16 → 2983.56] Make it
[2983.56 → 2984.24] You know
[2984.24 → 2984.98] Nothing's guaranteed
[2984.98 → 2986.18] This is the op
[2986.18 → 2987.48] Are you interested
[2987.48 → 2988.40] And
[2988.40 → 2990.32] We scraped them together
[2990.32 → 2991.46] The way X-Rail happened
[2991.46 → 2992.38] Was I was shooting
[2992.38 → 2993.24] That VR
[2993.24 → 2994.62] Did you watch the VR headset
[2994.62 → 2995.96] Side by side
[2995.96 → 2996.32] That I did
[2996.32 → 2996.52] No
[2996.52 → 2997.14] Okay
[2997.14 → 2997.54] So I did
[2997.54 → 2998.54] I did a VR headset
[2998.54 → 2999.02] Side by side
[2999.02 → 2999.58] With Pima
[2999.58 → 2999.90] And
[2999.90 → 3001.52] Oh shoot
[3001.52 → 3002.52] That really cool
[3002.52 → 3003.04] Lightweight
[3003.04 → 3004.30] OLED one
[3004.30 → 3005.22] Or micro OLED one
[3005.22 → 3006.82] Oh I'm so sorry
[3006.82 → 3007.10] Anyway
[3007.10 → 3008.12] Someone's going to tell me
[3008.12 → 3008.44] In the chat
[3008.44 → 3009.08] And that's going to
[3009.08 → 3009.56] Make it easier
[3009.56 → 3010.08] Anyway
[3010.08 → 3010.58] I did this
[3010.58 → 3011.14] This VR thing
[3011.14 → 3011.92] And next to them
[3011.92 → 3012.34] Was X-Rail
[3012.34 → 3013.02] And I'd seen
[3013.02 → 3013.60] A couple articles
[3013.60 → 3014.16] But they weren't
[3014.16 → 3014.68] Actually on our
[3014.68 → 3015.42] Hit list at that time
[3015.42 → 3016.42] So I went over
[3016.42 → 3016.96] To X-Rail
[3016.96 → 3017.90] With
[3017.90 → 3018.60] With Andrew
[3018.60 → 3019.16] I think it was
[3019.16 → 3019.88] Who was shooting with me
[3019.88 → 3021.22] Megan EX
[3021.22 → 3022.28] That's the one
[3022.28 → 3022.94] Shift all
[3022.94 → 3024.04] So I went over
[3024.04 → 3024.66] To X-Rail
[3024.66 → 3026.02] And I got in line
[3026.02 → 3026.72] For a demo
[3026.72 → 3028.08] And
[3028.08 → 3029.98] It was actually
[3029.98 → 3030.90] Kind of long line
[3030.90 → 3031.26] And we were
[3031.26 → 3031.80] Kind of thinking
[3031.80 → 3032.26] Of leaving
[3032.26 → 3033.26] And then one of
[3033.26 → 3033.68] Their reps
[3033.68 → 3034.24] Came like
[3034.24 → 3035.68] Scurrying over
[3035.68 → 3036.26] And was like
[3036.26 → 3037.78] Hi
[3037.78 → 3039.12] What would you
[3039.12 → 3039.82] Like to see
[3039.82 → 3040.68] And I was like
[3040.68 → 3041.28] Oh I actually
[3041.28 → 3041.88] Don't have a lot
[3041.88 → 3042.22] Of time
[3042.22 → 3042.82] I was
[3042.82 → 3043.54] I was thinking
[3043.54 → 3044.16] I might actually
[3044.16 → 3044.36] Go
[3044.36 → 3044.66] She's like
[3044.66 → 3045.22] No, no no
[3045.22 → 3045.68] I got you
[3045.68 → 3046.02] I got you
[3046.02 → 3046.32] I got you
[3046.32 → 3046.68] So clearly
[3046.68 → 3047.58] She figured out
[3047.58 → 3048.62] Who we were
[3048.62 → 3049.46] And I had
[3049.46 → 3050.02] At that point
[3050.02 → 3050.38] I just wanted
[3050.38 → 3050.98] To try it out
[3050.98 → 3052.08] Because I had read
[3052.08 → 3052.62] Some good things
[3052.62 → 3052.98] About it
[3052.98 → 3053.52] At the show
[3053.52 → 3055.04] But I
[3055.04 → 3055.54] I have
[3055.54 → 3056.92] I've never been
[3056.92 → 3057.50] A big fan
[3057.50 → 3058.58] Of the wearable
[3058.58 → 3059.16] Display thing
[3059.16 → 3059.72] Yeah
[3059.72 → 3060.74] I think I remember
[3060.74 → 3061.26] Doing a video
[3061.26 → 3062.10] With you a while
[3062.10 → 3062.46] Back
[3062.46 → 3063.04] Where we
[3063.04 → 3064.00] Kind of trashed
[3064.00 → 3064.30] Where we
[3064.30 → 3064.82] Used
[3064.82 → 3065.40] It wasn't
[3065.40 → 3065.86] I don't think
[3065.86 → 3066.18] That was an
[3066.18 → 3066.64] X-Trail one
[3066.64 → 3067.00] I think it was
[3067.00 → 3067.34] Someone else
[3067.34 → 3067.54] No
[3067.54 → 3068.60] But either way
[3068.60 → 3070.00] The technology
[3070.00 → 3071.08] A wasn't there
[3071.08 → 3071.60] Wasn't there
[3071.60 → 3072.64] And B
[3072.64 → 3073.96] Just didn't seem
[3073.96 → 3074.86] Compelling to me
[3074.86 → 3075.94] In at least that
[3075.94 → 3076.70] You know
[3076.70 → 3078.04] Weight and form factor
[3078.04 → 3079.74] And dongle situation
[3079.74 → 3080.92] And I think
[3080.92 → 3081.44] We were pretty much
[3081.44 → 3082.30] On the same page there
[3082.30 → 3083.94] So I
[3083.94 → 3084.26] You know
[3084.26 → 3084.98] I don't know
[3084.98 → 3085.92] I was like
[3085.92 → 3086.62] I'll try it
[3086.62 → 3086.86] Sure
[3086.86 → 3088.76] Anyway
[3088.76 → 3089.36] I try it
[3089.36 → 3090.80] Blows my freaking mind
[3090.80 → 3092.52] Because it's perfect
[3092.52 → 3094.80] The darkening
[3094.80 → 3095.68] The chromatic
[3095.68 → 3096.68] Chromatic
[3096.68 → 3098.42] Electro chromatic
[3098.42 → 3098.76] Whatever
[3098.76 → 3099.94] The darkening lenses
[3099.94 → 3101.10] Man
[3101.10 → 3102.00] They're perfect
[3102.00 → 3103.20] They block out
[3103.20 → 3104.18] So much
[3104.18 → 3105.20] Conveniently
[3105.20 → 3106.28] For X-Trail
[3106.28 → 3107.98] They had a super bright
[3107.98 → 3108.94] Obnoxious
[3108.94 → 3109.70] Neighbour
[3109.70 → 3110.74] Ah
[3110.74 → 3113.06] Almost convenient for them
[3113.06 → 3114.12] Exactly where their demo
[3114.12 → 3114.64] Was set up
[3114.64 → 3115.42] It was like
[3115.42 → 3115.88] Right there
[3115.88 → 3116.72] Shining into your eyes
[3116.72 → 3117.10] And you go
[3117.10 → 3120.04] And you can see it
[3120.04 → 3120.50] But
[3120.50 → 3121.08] When you're focused
[3121.08 → 3121.66] On your content
[3121.66 → 3123.28] You can totally ignore it
[3123.28 → 3124.00] So I was sitting there
[3124.00 → 3124.58] Playing Switch games
[3124.58 → 3124.90] I'm like
[3124.90 → 3127.16] I want to take
[3127.16 → 3127.92] I want to take this
[3127.92 → 3128.20] To the night
[3128.20 → 3128.96] So this is such a
[3128.96 → 3129.68] It's such a like
[3129.68 → 3130.56] Wow moment
[3130.56 → 3131.46] Because that's what you
[3131.46 → 3132.44] That's what you want
[3132.44 → 3133.00] For that
[3133.00 → 3133.80] Like that tight
[3133.80 → 3135.10] It needs to be visual too
[3135.10 → 3135.88] That tight format
[3135.88 → 3136.68] And I knew it wasn't
[3136.68 → 3137.16] Going to be that
[3137.16 → 3138.44] But I knew we had other things
[3138.44 → 3139.48] That could be
[3139.48 → 3140.38] More visual
[3140.38 → 3140.94] And more engaging
[3140.94 → 3141.38] For the audience
[3141.38 → 3142.20] His reaction was
[3142.20 → 3143.78] Quite visual though
[3143.78 → 3144.52] I think
[3144.52 → 3145.28] I was telling Linus
[3145.28 → 3145.80] About this too
[3145.80 → 3147.14] When he didn't get it
[3147.14 → 3147.72] For a while
[3147.72 → 3148.72] That almost made it
[3148.72 → 3149.40] So much better
[3149.40 → 3150.08] And to be clear
[3150.08 → 3151.38] He wasn't faking anything
[3151.38 → 3152.52] He could see
[3152.52 → 3153.60] The projected screen
[3153.60 → 3154.32] Just
[3154.32 → 3155.74] It seemed like
[3155.74 → 3156.38] It was like
[3156.38 → 3158.10] It didn't change
[3158.10 → 3159.04] The experience
[3159.04 → 3159.62] That much
[3159.62 → 3161.10] But when you can be like
[3161.10 → 3162.76] Yeah
[3162.76 → 3163.44] Yeah
[3163.44 → 3164.34] It's more comfortable
[3164.34 → 3165.42] You start spinning on like
[3165.42 → 3165.86] Okay
[3165.86 → 3167.38] What ways could I use this
[3167.38 → 3167.76] Yeah
[3167.76 → 3169.10] It gets a lot more interesting
[3169.10 → 3170.06] When you look away from it
[3170.06 → 3170.74] Exactly
[3170.74 → 3171.76] Didn't Luke try them last week
[3171.76 → 3172.34] Yeah I was
[3172.34 → 3173.58] I was going along with this segment
[3173.58 → 3174.32] Don't worry about it
[3174.32 → 3175.10] Oh yeah anyway
[3175.10 → 3176.86] The week before last week
[3176.86 → 3177.14] I think
[3177.14 → 3177.60] Right
[3177.60 → 3178.32] So
[3178.32 → 3179.24] So anyway
[3179.24 → 3180.24] We were there
[3180.24 → 3180.68] And I'm like
[3180.68 → 3181.30] Wow
[3181.30 → 3182.58] This is really cool
[3182.58 → 3185.16] Their CEO and founder
[3185.16 → 3186.54] Walks past
[3186.54 → 3188.38] Was having a meeting
[3188.38 → 3189.14] With someone at the booth
[3189.14 → 3190.04] Which they tend to do
[3190.04 → 3190.74] A lot of the time
[3190.74 → 3192.00] The huge wigs
[3192.00 → 3192.88] Tend to not
[3192.88 → 3193.46] They have actual meeting rooms
[3193.46 → 3194.82] A lot of the time
[3194.82 → 3195.92] They tend to not do the meetings
[3195.92 → 3196.94] On the show floor though
[3196.94 → 3199.00] In light of
[3199.00 → 3200.14] Recent events
[3200.14 → 3200.68] Involving
[3200.68 → 3202.44] CEOs getting gunned down
[3202.44 → 3202.98] In the streets
[3202.98 → 3203.50] Oh yeah
[3203.50 → 3204.90] CES
[3204.90 → 3205.94] Had a
[3205.94 → 3206.78] I would say
[3206.78 → 3207.84] A tighter approach
[3207.84 → 3208.36] To security
[3208.36 → 3209.12] Than in the past
[3209.12 → 3210.10] I'd still say
[3210.10 → 3210.94] There are a lot of gaps
[3210.94 → 3211.72] But anyway
[3211.72 → 3213.42] There's certainly been
[3213.42 → 3214.82] Some conversations
[3214.82 → 3215.52] Around
[3215.52 → 3215.94] You know
[3215.94 → 3216.44] CEOs
[3216.44 → 3217.58] And security
[3217.58 → 3219.94] Yeah
[3219.94 → 3221.48] I don't know
[3221.48 → 3222.08] If I'm going to say it
[3222.08 → 3223.04] Yeah that's probably fine
[3223.04 → 3224.70] There's like an incredibly easy way
[3224.70 → 3225.46] To get through security
[3225.46 → 3226.12] But I'll just
[3226.12 → 3227.16] Don't worry about it
[3227.16 → 3228.96] Don't worry about it
[3228.96 → 3230.52] Anyway
[3230.52 → 3231.90] But he happened to be there
[3231.90 → 3233.08] Because they did have a meeting room
[3233.08 → 3233.56] In their booth
[3233.56 → 3235.20] And he was like
[3235.20 → 3236.08] Yo
[3236.08 → 3237.12] And
[3237.12 → 3238.62] And, so I was
[3238.62 → 3238.94] So I
[3238.94 → 3239.56] So I basically
[3239.56 → 3240.96] I got to pitch to him personally
[3240.96 → 3242.46] Hey here's this op
[3242.46 → 3244.10] I really like this product
[3244.10 → 3244.90] Can
[3244.90 → 3246.32] Can I take it with me
[3246.32 → 3247.02] Right now
[3247.02 → 3248.00] And they weren't able
[3248.00 → 3248.48] To give it to me
[3248.48 → 3248.86] Right now
[3248.86 → 3249.26] Right now
[3249.26 → 3249.58] But we
[3249.58 → 3250.72] I think we sent procurement back
[3250.72 → 3251.56] Like two hours later
[3251.56 → 3252.76] And that product
[3252.76 → 3253.82] I think is not coming out
[3253.82 → 3254.82] For a while
[3254.82 → 3255.72] Like that's not out yet
[3255.72 → 3256.04] Yeah
[3256.04 → 3257.04] But they were like
[3257.04 → 3258.12] Yeah we got you
[3258.12 → 3259.04] We got you with everything
[3259.04 → 3259.84] They sent a rep
[3259.84 → 3261.24] With us to the Tonight Show
[3261.24 → 3261.80] Oh wow
[3261.80 → 3263.16] To like make sure that
[3263.16 → 3264.42] Everyone was briefed
[3264.42 → 3264.96] And everything was cool
[3264.96 → 3265.82] They gave me a briefing
[3265.82 → 3266.54] There on the show
[3266.54 → 3266.80] Honestly
[3266.80 → 3267.72] If that was my company
[3267.72 → 3268.24] Like yeah
[3268.24 → 3269.08] Well yeah
[3269.08 → 3270.78] Especially if it's that pre-release
[3270.78 → 3272.06] Like just have them there
[3272.06 → 3273.20] For like technical support
[3273.20 → 3274.94] Make sure nothing's going to go wrong
[3274.94 → 3275.32] Last minute
[3275.32 → 3276.06] And he had an extra pair
[3276.06 → 3276.72] Yeah of course
[3276.72 → 3277.10] Just in case
[3277.10 → 3277.76] Stuff goes wrong
[3277.76 → 3278.62] With pre-release hardware
[3278.62 → 3279.02] Yeah
[3279.02 → 3280.12] But no
[3280.12 → 3281.22] No
[3281.22 → 3282.18] X-Rail didn't pay
[3282.18 → 3282.98] A dime
[3282.98 → 3283.84] To me
[3283.84 → 3284.78] Or to the Tonight Show
[3284.78 → 3285.68] For their appearance there
[3285.68 → 3287.34] Like not everything
[3287.34 → 3287.94] Which is fine
[3287.94 → 3288.66] Not everything
[3288.66 → 3289.80] Is a conspiracy theory
[3289.80 → 3291.02] And you know what
[3291.02 → 3292.52] I don't doubt for a second
[3292.52 → 3293.48] That some things
[3293.48 → 3295.18] Do involve payment
[3295.18 → 3295.80] 100%
[3295.80 → 3296.52] 100%
[3296.52 → 3297.50] But that doesn't mean
[3297.50 → 3298.32] That it always is
[3298.32 → 3299.94] The other assumption
[3299.94 → 3300.70] That I saw here
[3300.70 → 3302.60] Is
[3302.60 → 3304.56] Linus is doing
[3304.56 → 3306.26] Loads of interviews
[3306.26 → 3307.96] So that he can go on
[3307.96 → 3308.52] More talks
[3308.52 → 3309.18] Industry events
[3309.18 → 3309.88] Be a speaker
[3309.88 → 3310.42] Etc
[3310.42 → 3312.44] Um
[3312.44 → 3313.76] That sounds like the
[3313.76 → 3314.78] Probably the thing
[3314.78 → 3315.94] That Linus would hate most
[3315.94 → 3316.80] So
[3316.80 → 3318.46] Guys
[3318.46 → 3319.40] Um
[3319.40 → 3322.00] I've talked publicly already
[3322.00 → 3323.42] About why we went down
[3323.42 → 3324.00] To California
[3324.00 → 3324.76] We haven't done
[3324.76 → 3326.08] Any collabs in a while
[3326.08 → 3326.70] Colin and Samir
[3326.70 → 3327.40] Have wanted to do something
[3327.40 → 3328.14] With us forever
[3328.14 → 3329.88] And Colton lined up
[3329.88 → 3330.58] The um
[3330.58 → 3331.38] Anthony Padilla
[3331.38 → 3332.18] Assumptions
[3332.18 → 3333.18] Uh
[3333.18 → 3333.56] Is it
[3333.56 → 3334.44] Is it a podcast
[3334.44 → 3335.14] Kind of what is it
[3335.14 → 3335.50] Interview
[3335.50 → 3336.50] Whatever thing
[3336.50 → 3337.44] Because we were down there
[3337.44 → 3338.44] Talking to Colin and Samir
[3338.44 → 3338.72] Anyway
[3338.72 → 3339.70] So that was back in
[3339.70 → 3340.94] December
[3340.94 → 3342.22] November
[3342.22 → 3342.86] I don't know
[3342.86 → 3343.54] It was back
[3343.54 → 3344.44] It was back last year
[3344.44 → 3345.42] Um
[3345.42 → 3347.52] As for the
[3347.52 → 3348.48] Tonight Show appearance
[3348.48 → 3349.90] Completely random
[3349.90 → 3350.98] Totally unrelated
[3350.98 → 3352.00] There's a bunch of
[3352.00 → 3352.84] Speculation in here
[3352.84 → 3353.64] That I was down there
[3353.64 → 3354.48] For Tonight Show
[3354.48 → 3355.32] And therefore
[3355.32 → 3356.00] I
[3356.00 → 3357.14] Hooked up with
[3357.14 → 3357.80] Colin and Samir
[3357.80 → 3358.60] And Anthony Padilla as well
[3358.60 → 3360.04] They're not even on the same coast
[3360.04 → 3360.84] Right
[3360.84 → 3361.20] Like
[3361.20 → 3362.48] Come on guys
[3362.48 → 3363.10] Sometimes
[3363.10 → 3364.20] Sometimes things just
[3364.20 → 3365.52] Sometimes things just happen
[3365.52 → 3365.86] We
[3365.86 → 3366.68] We've been in the mood
[3366.68 → 3367.48] To do some more collabs
[3367.48 → 3368.30] We've also collabed
[3368.30 → 3369.24] With Mighty Car Mods
[3369.24 → 3369.72] Uh
[3369.72 → 3370.64] We've also collabed
[3370.64 → 3371.26] With Doug Demure
[3371.26 → 3372.28] Um
[3372.28 → 3373.00] Just
[3373.00 → 3374.30] Just relax guys
[3374.30 → 3375.18] Relax guys
[3375.18 → 3375.66] It's okay
[3375.66 → 3376.36] It's okay
[3376.36 → 3377.50] Um
[3377.50 → 3378.16] What else
[3378.16 → 3378.90] What else we got here
[3378.90 → 3379.44] Man it was
[3379.44 → 3379.72] Oh
[3379.72 → 3380.32] It was so fun
[3380.32 → 3383.04] Um
[3383.04 → 3388.30] Next topic
[3388.30 → 3390.16] Do we move on
[3390.16 → 3390.70] Yeah
[3390.70 → 3391.58] I think so
[3391.58 → 3393.72] I've got a lot of people asking
[3393.72 → 3394.70] Would you go again
[3394.70 → 3397.68] I would like to formally say
[3397.68 → 3398.62] I would love to
[3398.62 → 3399.32] Yeah
[3399.32 → 3399.84] I
[3399.84 → 3400.32] Honestly
[3400.32 → 3401.64] The second it was
[3401.64 → 3403.36] Announced as an idea
[3403.36 → 3404.08] On like Wednesday
[3404.08 → 3404.54] Or whatever
[3404.54 → 3405.68] When it was going around internally
[3405.68 → 3406.28] Yeah
[3406.28 → 3406.68] Um
[3406.68 → 3408.72] My brain immediately jumped to like
[3408.72 → 3410.04] CES guy
[3410.04 → 3412.30] Just like you know
[3412.30 → 3413.72] Do a thing every year
[3413.72 → 3415.02] Or I mean maybe more often
[3415.02 → 3415.42] Who knows
[3415.42 → 3416.06] Well I don't know
[3416.06 → 3416.52] But like
[3416.52 → 3418.14] It was a cool segment
[3418.14 → 3418.76] And I think
[3418.76 → 3420.72] Tech has gotten
[3420.72 → 3421.82] More boring
[3421.82 → 3422.88] Over the years
[3422.88 → 3423.54] But
[3423.54 → 3424.28] Clearly
[3424.28 → 3425.80] It's not like anything's happening
[3425.80 → 3426.08] Yeah
[3426.08 → 3427.48] And it's not like there aren't people
[3427.48 → 3428.74] Who are five years out of the loop
[3428.74 → 3429.20] That I could
[3429.20 → 3430.16] Show
[3430.16 → 3431.96] Industries that have been developing
[3431.96 → 3432.88] For years and years and years
[3432.88 → 3433.12] Like
[3433.12 → 3434.06] Non-standard audience
[3434.06 → 3434.96] Like wearable displays
[3434.96 → 3435.26] Yeah
[3435.26 → 3435.92] Yeah
[3435.92 → 3436.72] Be like okay yeah
[3436.72 → 3437.58] But we're at the point now
[3437.58 → 3438.40] Where it's like wow cool
[3438.40 → 3438.78] Like these
[3438.78 → 3439.60] A lot of
[3439.60 → 3440.60] A lot of mainstream people
[3440.60 → 3442.32] If Apple doesn't announce one
[3442.32 → 3443.54] I don't
[3443.54 → 3444.24] I don't know what it is
[3444.24 → 3444.42] Yeah
[3444.42 → 3445.46] And even Apple
[3445.46 → 3446.26] Like dude
[3446.26 → 3448.14] Do you know how easy it would be
[3448.14 → 3449.18] To find an Apple person
[3449.18 → 3449.80] Who like
[3449.80 → 3451.28] Doesn't know anything about the Vision Pro
[3451.28 → 3451.60] Because
[3451.60 → 3452.36] Who cares
[3452.36 → 3453.40] About the Vision Pro
[3453.40 → 3455.72] Uh
[3455.72 → 3455.96] Hold on
[3455.96 → 3456.62] I'm trying to find
[3456.62 → 3457.78] I'm trying to find the
[3457.78 → 3458.78] I'm trying to find the outreach
[3458.78 → 3459.52] Someone asked
[3459.52 → 3461.42] What I put in my rider
[3461.42 → 3462.62] And
[3462.62 → 3464.18] So I want to find my
[3464.18 → 3465.40] I want to find my response
[3465.40 → 3466.16] Email to them
[3466.16 → 3466.80] Because
[3466.80 → 3468.62] I basically just said
[3468.62 → 3469.58] Um
[3469.58 → 3473.92] I said
[3473.92 → 3474.90] Can you send me an example
[3474.90 → 3475.70] Of a previous segment
[3475.70 → 3476.70] That would give me some idea
[3476.70 → 3477.44] Of what format
[3477.44 → 3478.48] And what I should expect
[3478.48 → 3479.68] And then
[3479.68 → 3480.38] I said
[3480.38 → 3481.08] I'm thighs deep
[3481.08 → 3482.12] In CES stuff right now
[3482.12 → 3483.16] But I'll get back to you today
[3483.16 → 3484.98] And then I said
[3484.98 → 3486.62] Um
[3486.62 → 3489.70] I'm thighs deep
[3489.70 → 3490.88] I don't know
[3490.88 → 3492.30] That's an expression right
[3492.30 → 3496.18] I know Taylor says that all the time
[3496.18 → 3496.42] Yeah
[3496.42 → 3496.72] Yeah
[3496.72 → 3498.30] Uh
[3498.30 → 3498.66] Hold on
[3498.66 → 3499.80] Where did I say yes
[3499.80 → 3500.18] Because I
[3500.18 → 3501.52] I basically was like
[3501.52 → 3503.22] Uh
[3503.22 → 3503.68] Hold on
[3503.68 → 3504.00] Hold on
[3504.00 → 3504.50] Hold on
[3504.50 → 3506.68] Basically nothing
[3506.68 → 3507.38] Yeah
[3507.38 → 3509.70] Here we're just talking like
[3509.70 → 3511.22] Jet
[3511.22 → 3511.54] Okay
[3511.54 → 3512.38] I think I missed it
[3512.38 → 3513.74] It must have been like a one-liner
[3513.74 → 3514.20] Or something
[3514.20 → 3514.66] But yeah
[3514.66 → 3516.36] I had nothing in my rider
[3516.36 → 3517.88] I had no idea what to expect
[3517.88 → 3519.62] I've never done this before
[3519.62 → 3521.76] It felt pretty cool
[3521.76 → 3522.52] To get the tap
[3522.52 → 3524.06] You know
[3524.06 → 3526.36] I'd love to know
[3526.36 → 3528.00] We actually haven't gotten a lot of those
[3528.00 → 3528.96] No
[3528.96 → 3529.46] Um
[3529.46 → 3530.28] And you know what
[3530.28 → 3532.44] I kinda get it
[3532.44 → 3534.56] Like I'm not really TV ready
[3534.56 → 3535.82] You know
[3535.82 → 3537.74] You did good by the end
[3537.74 → 3538.80] You did very good by the end
[3538.80 → 3539.94] I mean in other ways though
[3539.94 → 3540.60] Like I
[3540.60 → 3541.54] Like I literally
[3541.54 → 3542.86] I saw
[3542.86 → 3543.82] I saw a couple of people
[3543.82 → 3544.30] That were like
[3544.30 → 3544.84] Yo Linus
[3544.84 → 3545.96] You have to respect the
[3545.96 → 3546.70] You know
[3546.70 → 3547.38] The dress code
[3547.38 → 3548.10] You know
[3548.10 → 3548.78] Where's your suit
[3548.78 → 3549.76] And I'm like
[3549.76 → 3549.94] Yo
[3549.94 → 3550.84] I don't even like
[3550.84 → 3552.18] Own a suit that fits
[3552.18 → 3552.58] Yeah
[3552.58 → 3553.30] And
[3553.30 → 3554.68] Okay
[3554.68 → 3555.00] I could
[3555.00 → 3555.74] I could probably
[3555.74 → 3556.70] I could probably buy one
[3556.70 → 3557.08] But like
[3557.08 → 3558.62] That's never been me
[3558.62 → 3560.30] That's never been
[3560.30 → 3561.78] My thing
[3561.78 → 3562.70] I think it's fine
[3562.70 → 3563.46] Like the
[3563.46 → 3564.26] There was a
[3564.26 → 3565.38] There was a commenter
[3565.38 → 3566.64] That compared it to like
[3566.64 → 3567.62] Animal handlers
[3567.62 → 3568.46] Going on
[3568.46 → 3570.18] On these types of live shows
[3570.18 → 3571.18] I would love
[3571.18 → 3572.34] You're like tech bro guy
[3572.34 → 3573.72] I would love to be
[3573.72 → 3575.44] Animal handler
[3575.44 → 3576.52] Tech guy
[3576.52 → 3577.04] Love tech
[3577.04 → 3578.10] I don't necessarily
[3578.10 → 3579.40] I wouldn't necessarily
[3579.40 → 3580.26] Want to be like
[3580.26 → 3582.00] Like pigeonholed
[3582.00 → 3582.44] Like I wouldn't
[3582.44 → 3582.66] No
[3582.66 → 3583.92] Like at some point
[3583.92 → 3584.32] You know
[3584.32 → 3585.36] I would want to develop
[3585.36 → 3586.74] And I don't
[3586.74 → 3587.80] I don't know how this works
[3587.80 → 3588.56] And I haven't
[3588.56 → 3589.76] I don't know
[3589.76 → 3590.96] But I'm just kind of
[3590.96 → 3591.80] Talking out loud here
[3591.80 → 3591.98] You know
[3591.98 → 3592.68] At some point
[3592.68 → 3594.04] I would love to
[3594.04 → 3596.62] I don't know
[3596.62 → 3597.36] Well whatever
[3597.36 → 3598.72] I'll be tech bro guy
[3598.72 → 3599.08] To start
[3599.08 → 3601.08] Because I have to know
[3601.08 → 3601.68] My role right
[3601.68 → 3602.44] So you wanted to like

[3605.00 → 3605.38] Bad Bunny

[3621.46 → 3622.58] A way different hairstyle

[3624.52 → 3625.08] As Bad Bunny
[3625.08 → 3625.90] I'll tell you that much
[3625.90 → 3627.22] I could dye it again for you
[3627.22 → 3628.70] Dude
[3628.70 → 3629.76] Yeah I got you
[3629.76 → 3631.06] I totally accidentally
[3631.06 → 3632.48] Flattened my hair too much
[3632.48 → 3634.24] I looked like such a nerd
[3634.24 → 3635.52] Oh it was perfect
[3635.52 → 3636.42] That fits the
[3636.42 → 3637.46] That fits the theme
[3637.46 → 3638.26] You're adorable
[3638.26 → 3638.76] It's okay
[3638.76 → 3639.32] No
[3639.32 → 3640.68] I'm going to have better hair
[3640.68 → 3642.00] Next time I promise
[3642.00 → 3643.36] Oh my goodness
[3643.36 → 3643.98] Perm
[3643.98 → 3644.88] Yeah I like that idea
[3644.88 → 3645.48] Brick Payne
[3645.48 → 3645.94] Oh
[3645.94 → 3647.40] Anyway
[3647.40 → 3649.62] So um
[3649.62 → 3651.04] Yeah
[3651.04 → 3651.78] It was
[3651.78 → 3652.60] Honestly
[3652.60 → 3655.04] It was an amazing week
[3655.04 → 3656.30] Did you know
[3656.30 → 3657.30] That during CES
[3657.30 → 3657.86] We hit
[3657.86 → 3659.02] Our all-time highest
[3659.02 → 3659.70] Reviews in a day
[3659.70 → 3662.04] We're like
[3662.04 → 3663.06] Reviews in a day
[3663.06 → 3663.62] Views
[3663.62 → 3664.06] Oh okay
[3664.06 → 3664.94] We're like
[3664.94 → 3666.06] Killing it
[3666.06 → 3666.68] Yeah hell yeah
[3666.68 → 3668.74] I was on flipping TV
[3668.74 → 3670.00] It was
[3670.00 → 3670.34] Ah
[3670.34 → 3670.86] Okay
[3670.86 → 3671.78] Basically
[3671.78 → 3672.36] I am
[3672.36 → 3673.78] I'm still kind of
[3673.78 → 3674.34] Riding the high
[3674.34 → 3675.22] To be honest with you
[3675.22 → 3676.22] It has definitely been
[3676.22 → 3677.22] A week of all time
[3677.22 → 3677.90] Yes
[3677.90 → 3678.58] One of
[3678.58 → 3679.44] One of the weeks
[3679.44 → 3680.24] It has definitely
[3680.24 → 3680.82] Been a week
[3680.82 → 3683.34] What would I wear
[3683.34 → 3684.56] Next time
[3684.56 → 3686.02] Cause you know
[3686.02 → 3686.60] It's got to be
[3686.60 → 3687.44] From Creator Warehouse
[3687.44 → 3687.76] Dude
[3687.76 → 3689.04] We have some stuff
[3689.04 → 3689.82] Coming that is
[3689.82 → 3691.72] Very cool
[3691.72 → 3693.72] I don't even know
[3693.72 → 3694.72] Should I go cool
[3694.72 → 3696.16] Or should I go like
[3696.16 → 3696.94] Our professional
[3696.94 → 3698.12] Like our 9 to 5 line
[3698.12 → 3699.06] What do you think
[3699.06 → 3702.08] Giant logos
[3702.08 → 3702.96] I don't
[3702.96 → 3703.82] I don't think you need
[3703.82 → 3704.68] To start going
[3704.68 → 3706.40] Professional on it
[3706.40 → 3707.34] Well okay
[3707.34 → 3708.12] If you wanna
[3708.12 → 3709.00] Like get out
[3709.00 → 3709.72] Of the tech bro
[3709.72 → 3710.10] Niche
[3710.10 → 3711.30] Then maybe you should
[3711.30 → 3711.90] I don't even think
[3711.90 → 3712.82] I'm like tech bro
[3712.82 → 3713.52] With my style
[3713.52 → 3714.14] I'm just like
[3714.14 → 3714.84] I'm more like
[3714.84 → 3716.54] Yeah the guy
[3716.54 → 3717.22] Who works on your
[3717.22 → 3717.64] Cabling
[3717.64 → 3718.44] Like I'm not really
[3718.44 → 3719.02] It's definitely
[3719.02 → 3719.82] Geeky though
[3719.82 → 3720.86] Yeah fair enough
[3720.86 → 3721.48] If you want to get
[3721.48 → 3722.26] Out of the like
[3722.26 → 3723.46] I am geek person
[3723.46 → 3724.40] I come on here
[3724.40 → 3725.66] To be geek person
[3725.66 → 3726.40] Than
[3726.40 → 3726.98] Blow plane wants
[3726.98 → 3728.08] RGB fur coat
[3728.08 → 3728.66] Okay
[3728.66 → 3730.14] That is not happening
[3730.14 → 3731.54] That would be cool
[3731.54 → 3732.50] If you want to be cool
[3732.50 → 3733.32] I'd be pretty safe
[3733.32 → 3734.32] RGB fur coat
[3734.32 → 3734.86] You could have
[3734.86 → 3736.10] A little RGB cane
[3736.10 → 3737.06] Made out of memory
[3737.06 → 3738.40] Rope belt
[3738.40 → 3739.94] Dad hat
[3739.94 → 3741.38] Wouldn't have to see
[3741.38 → 3741.96] Your terrible hair
[3741.96 → 3742.58] I mean flat hair
[3742.58 → 3743.22] I mean good hair
[3743.22 → 3749.32] I didn't get the middle finger
[3749.32 → 3751.26] Their crew is so much nicer
[3751.26 → 3751.78] Than mine
[3751.78 → 3754.32] Yeah, but we do it
[3754.32 → 3755.26] Because we love you
[3755.26 → 3759.06] Oh man
[3759.06 → 3760.12] Yeah I don't know
[3760.12 → 3761.30] I think it depends
[3761.30 → 3762.00] On the vibe
[3762.00 → 3762.48] Of the episode
[3762.48 → 3762.96] That you're doing
[3762.96 → 3764.82] If you're a tech handler
[3764.82 → 3765.54] Yeah
[3765.54 → 3766.68] Then I don't know
[3766.68 → 3767.34] We're geeky stuff
[3767.34 → 3768.12] We're cool stuff
[3768.12 → 3770.46] If you're trying to like
[3770.46 → 3772.12] I think
[3772.12 → 3772.88] You know what
[3772.88 → 3773.82] I think I
[3773.82 → 3774.26] If
[3774.26 → 3774.92] If
[3774.92 → 3776.80] If I get the tap
[3776.80 → 3777.30] Again
[3777.30 → 3778.24] I am
[3778.24 → 3779.18] I think
[3779.18 → 3780.38] What I want to do for now
[3780.38 → 3780.98] Is just
[3780.98 → 3782.44] Do what they ask
[3782.44 → 3783.80] Because realistically
[3783.80 → 3784.76] I know my world
[3784.76 → 3786.16] And if they wanted to
[3786.16 → 3787.00] Like come do a
[3787.00 → 3787.64] YouTube video
[3787.64 → 3788.44] About technology
[3788.44 → 3789.96] I'm sure that they would ask
[3789.96 → 3791.32] For guidance from me
[3791.32 → 3792.50] And so if
[3792.50 → 3793.64] If they want to do
[3793.64 → 3794.32] A TV segment
[3794.32 → 3795.40] Then I think I'll just
[3795.40 → 3796.44] Keep doing what I'm doing
[3796.44 → 3797.40] Which is
[3797.40 → 3798.06] Hey
[3798.06 → 3799.62] How do you want me to do this
[3799.62 → 3799.96] You know
[3799.96 → 3801.18] Where's the edge
[3801.18 → 3802.10] In terms of humour
[3802.10 → 3802.82] Where's the edge
[3802.82 → 3803.82] In terms of like
[3803.82 → 3805.16] You know roasting the host
[3805.16 → 3805.70] Where's
[3805.70 → 3807.78] Because I asked a lot of questions
[3807.78 → 3808.76] In the lead up
[3808.76 → 3809.64] Which is part of I think
[3809.64 → 3810.52] Why I was so nervous
[3810.52 → 3811.46] Because I was trying to
[3811.46 → 3812.56] Remember the answers
[3812.56 → 3812.88] To everything
[3812.88 → 3813.38] Hold in my head
[3813.38 → 3813.56] Because
[3813.56 → 3814.58] Because I just
[3814.58 → 3815.10] I don't
[3815.10 → 3816.26] I don't know the vibe
[3816.26 → 3816.60] Yeah
[3816.60 → 3818.46] I don't know what the proper
[3818.46 → 3819.36] Etiquette is
[3819.36 → 3819.68] Yeah
[3819.68 → 3821.36] And like I said
[3821.36 → 3822.30] They were so
[3822.30 → 3823.32] Gracious
[3823.32 → 3824.76] And so
[3824.76 → 3825.60] So helpful
[3825.60 → 3826.62] And so accommodating
[3826.62 → 3828.40] Okay
[3828.40 → 3828.98] Yeah
[3828.98 → 3829.80] Let's move on though
[3829.80 → 3830.04] Yeah
[3830.04 → 3830.64] New topic
[3830.64 → 3830.88] Yeah
[3830.88 → 3831.62] What do you want to talk about
[3831.62 → 3833.66] The Switch
[3833.66 → 3834.52] Do we talk about the Switch
[3834.52 → 3836.06] Let's talk about the Switch
[3836.06 → 3836.74] It's
[3836.74 → 3837.58] We have a full video
[3837.58 → 3838.86] Coming tomorrow
[3838.86 → 3840.66] As soon as possible
[3840.66 → 3841.76] So it's going to be
[3841.76 → 3842.50] Taking our Saturday
[3842.50 → 3843.32] Release slot
[3843.32 → 3844.56] But it
[3844.56 → 3845.34] It will
[3845.34 → 3845.94] It will
[3845.94 → 3847.28] Maybe come sooner
[3847.28 → 3848.06] Depending on when
[3848.06 → 3848.90] The reviews are done
[3848.90 → 3849.32] And like
[3849.32 → 3850.26] We're going to kind of
[3850.26 → 3851.54] Step on the WAN show's
[3851.54 → 3852.14] Normal window
[3852.14 → 3853.14] To sit and get views
[3853.14 → 3854.38] With our Switch 2 video
[3854.38 → 3854.62] If
[3854.62 → 3855.76] As soon as it's ready
[3855.76 → 3857.68] But David put it together
[3857.68 → 3859.12] Because of course
[3859.12 → 3859.76] It was David
[3859.76 → 3859.94] Yeah
[3859.94 → 3860.36] Makes sense
[3860.36 → 3861.32] Who wrote it
[3861.32 → 3862.90] And he tried to make it
[3862.90 → 3864.50] A little bit more in depth
[3864.50 → 3865.28] Than just
[3865.28 → 3866.32] Here's a summary
[3866.32 → 3867.44] Of what Nintendo said
[3867.44 → 3867.90] In the announcement
[3867.90 → 3868.72] Because you can't really
[3868.72 → 3869.56] Make an 8-minute video
[3869.56 → 3870.38] But a 2 minute
[3870.38 → 3871.90] 22 second teaser
[3871.90 → 3873.38] And instead
[3873.38 → 3874.56] What he did
[3874.56 → 3876.42] Was he put together
[3876.42 → 3877.94] A compilation
[3877.94 → 3878.72] Of both
[3878.72 → 3879.90] What we know
[3879.90 → 3880.84] From the announcement
[3880.84 → 3882.10] And also
[3882.10 → 3884.50] What we probably know
[3884.50 → 3885.58] In sort of like
[3885.58 → 3886.56] A decreasing order
[3886.56 → 3887.28] Of confidence
[3887.28 → 3888.08] Interesting
[3888.08 → 3888.94] If that makes sense
[3888.94 → 3889.54] Yeah I like that
[3889.54 → 3891.06] And so he managed to paint
[3891.06 → 3892.26] What I think is
[3892.26 → 3893.40] Is a really
[3893.40 → 3894.86] Not complete
[3894.86 → 3896.24] Because we don't know
[3896.24 → 3896.72] For sure
[3896.72 → 3897.50] And we don't normally
[3897.50 → 3898.98] Report on rumour mill stuff
[3898.98 → 3900.68] But what we can see
[3900.68 → 3901.80] Is sources
[3901.80 → 3903.58] That were somewhat
[3903.58 → 3904.46] Validated
[3904.46 → 3906.34] By Nintendo's video
[3906.34 → 3908.36] So if they say
[3908.36 → 3909.30] Yeah it's going to have this
[3909.30 → 3909.80] It's going to have this
[3909.80 → 3910.38] It's going to have this
[3910.38 → 3910.90] We see all that
[3910.90 → 3911.26] In the teaser
[3911.26 → 3911.64] And they say
[3911.64 → 3912.08] Oh by the way
[3912.08 → 3912.84] Also this this this
[3912.84 → 3913.28] And this
[3913.28 → 3915.10] That adds credibility
[3915.10 → 3916.26] Versus the sources
[3916.26 → 3917.52] That got a bunch of stuff wrong
[3917.52 → 3918.94] Compared to Nintendo's teaser
[3918.94 → 3919.64] If that makes sense
[3919.64 → 3921.28] First question
[3921.28 → 3922.40] Or is there
[3922.40 → 3922.84] Oh sorry
[3922.84 → 3923.48] Are we supposed
[3923.48 → 3924.26] Are we supposed to do
[3924.26 → 3924.82] Like a summary
[3924.82 → 3926.82] Okay do you want
[3926.82 → 3927.32] To read the thing
[3927.32 → 3927.48] Sure
[3927.48 → 3928.16] Yeah
[3928.16 → 3930.10] In a very chill
[3930.10 → 3930.80] YouTube video
[3930.80 → 3931.64] Nintendo officially
[3931.64 → 3932.70] Announced the successor
[3932.70 → 3933.90] To the Uber successful
[3933.90 → 3934.82] Hybrid console
[3934.82 → 3936.56] Coming out this year
[3936.56 → 3938.26] Their Switch 1
[3938.26 → 3940.98] Shipped 146 million units
[3940.98 → 3941.64] It was the third
[3941.64 → 3942.70] Best selling console
[3942.70 → 3943.46] Of all time
[3943.46 → 3945.18] Behind in first place
[3945.18 → 3945.94] The PlayStation 2
[3945.94 → 3946.66] And in second place
[3946.66 → 3947.22] The DS
[3947.22 → 3948.78] They showed off
[3948.78 → 3950.56] The new grown up
[3950.56 → 3951.06] Aesthetic
[3951.06 → 3952.02] I don't know what that means
[3952.02 → 3952.92] It looked really similar
[3952.92 → 3953.24] To me
[3953.24 → 3954.62] New Joy-Cons
[3954.62 → 3956.02] Two USB-C ports
[3956.02 → 3956.70] Interesting
[3956.70 → 3958.14] Backwards compatibility
[3958.16 → 3959.90] For the most part
[3959.90 → 3962.16] And a new Mario Kart game
[3962.16 → 3963.48] They also gave us
[3963.48 → 3964.98] April 2nd 2025
[3964.98 → 3966.70] As the date for the direct
[3966.70 → 3967.88] Not the release date
[3967.88 → 3968.56] But the direct
[3968.56 → 3970.50] Where we will get more details
[3970.50 → 3971.98] We're going to have
[3971.98 → 3973.30] Our in-depth take
[3973.30 → 3973.84] With a breakdown
[3973.84 → 3974.62] Of both the video
[3974.62 → 3975.26] And the rumours
[3975.26 → 3976.10] That announcement
[3976.10 → 3976.90] Blah blah blah
[3976.90 → 3978.66] Everything Linus was just saying
[3978.66 → 3979.30] And then there's
[3979.30 → 3980.08] Discussion questions
[3980.08 → 3981.16] Discussion question
[3981.16 → 3981.44] Yeah
[3981.44 → 3982.34] Will you buy one?
[3982.74 → 3983.18] Probably
[3983.18 → 3984.16] Okay
[3984.16 → 3985.38] So this
[3985.38 → 3987.20] I have a bone to pick with you
[3987.20 → 3988.64] I saw that coming
[3988.64 → 3990.64] You talk
[3990.64 → 3991.64] A big game
[3991.64 → 3992.42] About thinking
[3992.42 → 3993.66] Handheld PCs are cool
[3993.66 → 3996.46] You never buy one
[3996.46 → 3998.78] Nintendo releases something
[3998.78 → 3999.88] And you're like
[3999.88 → 4001.22] Please daddy
[4001.22 → 4002.06] Take my money
[4002.06 → 4002.72] Please
[4002.72 → 4003.76] Can you take my money?
[4003.76 → 4006.34] I think with the Switch
[4006.34 → 4009.20] There isn't going to be a new one
[4009.20 → 4009.68] For like
[4009.68 → 4010.36] What?
[4010.50 → 4010.84] I don't know
[4010.84 → 4011.32] Six years
[4011.32 → 4011.60] So?
[4012.64 → 4013.62] With the handheld PCs
[4013.62 → 4014.42] The Steam Deck
[4014.42 → 4015.12] Has had a
[4015.12 → 4017.14] Three year life so far?
[4017.22 → 4017.76] Four years?
[4017.84 → 4018.56] When did Steam Deck come up?
[4018.56 → 4019.34] Yeah but then there's been
[4019.34 → 4020.04] The Ally
[4020.04 → 4020.86] And there's been
[4020.86 → 4022.00] All these other things
[4022.00 → 4022.24] So?
[4022.24 → 4022.56] Blah blah blah
[4022.56 → 4023.10] So what?
[4023.64 → 4024.54] So what?
[4024.66 → 4025.06] Let's say
[4025.06 → 4026.52] Nintendo has a
[4026.52 → 4027.26] Long life
[4027.26 → 4028.30] But you know
[4028.30 → 4029.10] It's not long
[4029.10 → 4030.12] Because Sega might
[4030.12 → 4030.96] Make a handheld again
[4030.96 → 4031.78] What are you even talking about?
[4031.80 → 4032.08] I also
[4032.08 → 4033.58] To a certain degree
[4033.58 → 4033.86] Yeah
[4033.86 → 4034.82] Like the idea
[4034.82 → 4035.98] That it's different stuff
[4035.98 → 4038.30] Okay
[4038.30 → 4039.66] I can play all the things
[4039.66 → 4040.40] That are going to be on
[4040.40 → 4041.40] One of the other handhelds
[4041.40 → 4041.98] On my PC
[4041.98 → 4043.02] I mean Nintendo might
[4043.02 → 4043.70] And I will do that
[4043.70 → 4044.10] Most of the time
[4044.10 → 4044.84] About three and a half years
[4044.84 → 4045.54] For Steam Deck by the way
[4045.54 → 4046.50] Nintendo might not
[4046.50 → 4047.66] Like me acknowledging this
[4047.66 → 4048.52] But you could certainly
[4048.52 → 4050.46] Play lots of stuff
[4050.46 → 4051.76] On a handheld PC
[4051.76 → 4053.14] I also don't do this
[4053.14 → 4055.38] I mean I actually don't
[4055.38 → 4055.96] I own
[4055.96 → 4057.22] Two Switches
[4057.22 → 4058.12] I also own a Switch
[4058.12 → 4059.82] And it's just a better experience
[4059.82 → 4060.40] Well yeah
[4060.40 → 4060.78] That
[4060.78 → 4061.72] Okay this is fair
[4061.72 → 4062.86] I only
[4062.86 → 4064.54] I only have a first gen ally though
[4064.54 → 4065.38] And the battery life
[4065.38 → 4066.22] Kind of sucks so much
[4066.22 → 4066.90] That I'd honestly
[4066.90 → 4068.04] Kind of rather play on the Switch
[4068.04 → 4068.78] I also have the
[4068.78 → 4070.84] Like the rare Switch
[4070.84 → 4072.14] That can do the thing
[4072.14 → 4074.12] Which I haven't done
[4074.12 → 4076.42] But I do have the
[4076.42 → 4077.34] Key that I made
[4077.34 → 4080.70] Moving on
[4080.70 → 4082.10] Those rare ones
[4082.10 → 4082.90] Are those like
[4082.90 → 4083.72] The really early ones
[4083.72 → 4084.40] Yeah the early ones
[4084.40 → 4085.46] Nice I probably have
[4085.46 → 4086.90] So Luke's not done yet though
[4086.90 → 4087.76] Okay
[4087.76 → 4093.98] Depends on how much it costs
[4093.98 → 4094.92] I might just not buy one
[4094.92 → 4096.30] Because the thing
[4096.30 → 4097.50] I was most excited about
[4097.50 → 4098.36] Classic Luke
[4098.36 → 4098.60] Okay
[4098.60 → 4099.66] It costs
[4099.66 → 4102.74] Wait this costs money
[4102.74 → 4104.32] You offer latest thing
[4104.32 → 4105.12] I offer
[4105.12 → 4106.48] Zero dollars
[4106.48 → 4106.78] No
[4106.78 → 4110.84] I don't know
[4110.84 → 4111.20] It depends
[4111.20 → 4112.72] There was a
[4112.72 → 4113.40] There were a bunch of things
[4113.40 → 4114.42] That got me excited in the video
[4114.42 → 4115.02] You know I'm happy
[4115.02 → 4115.70] With a bigger screen
[4115.70 → 4117.04] I'm especially happy
[4117.04 → 4118.26] About bigger controllers
[4118.26 → 4119.28] My goodness
[4119.28 → 4120.32] That was my biggest problem
[4120.32 → 4121.18] With the original Switch
[4121.18 → 4122.46] The controllers are just too
[4122.46 → 4124.18] I felt like I was doing this
[4124.18 → 4124.68] The whole time
[4124.68 → 4125.24] They're too small
[4125.24 → 4128.20] So happy about both of those things
[4128.20 → 4129.24] But honestly
[4129.24 → 4130.18] The like main thing
[4130.18 → 4130.56] That I was like
[4130.56 → 4131.30] Oh good
[4131.30 → 4131.76] Nice
[4131.76 → 4132.60] Was when they announced
[4132.60 → 4133.62] Backwards compatibility
[4133.62 → 4134.60] Because I still have a bunch of
[4134.60 → 4135.64] Switch games I haven't played
[4135.64 → 4136.88] So like at that point
[4136.88 → 4137.78] Do I just wait
[4137.78 → 4138.92] Until I've played those
[4138.92 → 4140.46] And then get whatever
[4140.46 → 4140.94] I don't know
[4140.94 → 4141.58] They'll have some like
[4141.58 → 4142.18] Cool version
[4142.18 → 4143.22] Or an upgraded version
[4143.22 → 4144.18] Or something down the line
[4144.18 → 4144.94] Maybe I get that
[4144.94 → 4145.58] Like I don't
[4145.58 → 4146.80] I don't know that I'll get it on release
[4146.80 → 4148.34] I think I have a backlog
[4148.34 → 4149.22] Of like three different
[4149.22 → 4149.66] Switch games
[4149.66 → 4150.34] That I still need to play
[4150.34 → 4150.88] So
[4150.88 → 4151.98] I don't know
[4151.98 → 4152.88] I'm in no rush
[4152.88 → 4154.44] Wow Luke being like
[4154.44 → 4155.40] I have a backlog
[4155.40 → 4156.40] Of three games
[4156.40 → 4157.36] As though that's gonna
[4157.36 → 4158.46] Impress you guys
[4158.46 → 4161.00] Come on
[4161.00 → 4161.82] I have a lot more
[4161.82 → 4162.64] Hit me in the chat
[4162.64 → 4163.44] Hit me in the chat
[4163.44 → 4165.16] What's your unplayed
[4165.16 → 4166.78] What's your unplayed queue look like
[4166.78 → 4167.66] You'd have to just give
[4167.66 → 4168.40] The Switch one
[4168.40 → 4169.16] Alright alright alright
[4169.16 → 4169.72] Because I have
[4169.72 → 4171.28] Way more than that on PC
[4171.28 → 4171.72] Yeah alright
[4171.72 → 4172.42] You can't list
[4172.42 → 4173.46] Someone said 700 games
[4173.46 → 4174.30] You can't list
[4174.30 → 4175.44] Every game you have in Steam
[4175.44 → 4176.26] Because you're not
[4176.26 → 4177.08] Going to play all of those
[4177.08 → 4177.94] You have to be real
[4177.94 → 4178.36] With yourself
[4178.36 → 4179.20] When it comes to your backlog
[4179.20 → 4180.88] Are you actually
[4180.88 → 4181.76] Going to play this
[4181.76 → 4182.20] If not
[4182.20 → 4182.94] Get it out of there
[4182.94 → 4183.40] He's so passionate
[4183.40 → 4184.72] Don't lie to yourself
[4184.72 → 4185.84] Why are you so passionate
[4185.84 → 4185.94] About this
[4185.94 → 4186.44] Because I'm trying to
[4186.44 → 4187.68] Go with a 700 game
[4187.68 → 4188.40] No you don't
[4188.40 → 4188.80] You're not
[4188.80 → 4190.24] You don't have a 700 game backlog
[4190.24 → 4190.68] Prove it
[4190.68 → 4192.64] Prove it now
[4192.64 → 4193.10] That's fair
[4193.10 → 4193.52] That's fair
[4193.52 → 4194.06] I can't do that
[4194.06 → 4194.76] Prove it
[4194.76 → 4195.90] Alright
[4195.90 → 4197.56] Are you going to play that
[4197.56 → 4198.44] You're going to play that game
[4198.44 → 4199.90] That you got on a humble bundle code
[4199.90 → 4202.24] Literally like 15 years ago
[4202.24 → 4203.74] I don't think so
[4203.74 → 4204.54] I'm buying one too
[4204.54 → 4206.38] Yeah of course
[4206.38 → 4208.12] The screen honestly
[4208.12 → 4209.46] Looks kind of too big though
[4209.46 → 4210.52] Too big
[4210.52 → 4211.56] Look at my hands
[4211.56 → 4212.86] Oh no
[4212.86 → 4213.44] Do we have the wrong
[4213.44 → 4214.68] What do you think
[4214.68 → 4215.44] About the controllers
[4215.44 → 4217.74] I think the controllers
[4217.74 → 4218.58] Are still going to be okay
[4218.58 → 4219.66] Because even I
[4219.66 → 4220.88] Found the original Switch
[4220.88 → 4221.60] They were small
[4221.60 → 4222.62] Kind of cramps
[4222.62 → 4223.00] Yeah
[4223.00 → 4224.52] You know what I realized though
[4224.52 → 4226.06] Is I bought
[4226.06 → 4227.14] An original Switch
[4227.14 → 4227.58] Oh
[4227.58 → 4228.94] When I had my bottom
[4228.94 → 4229.82] Wisdom teeth out
[4229.82 → 4231.84] It had just
[4231.84 → 4233.02] No way
[4233.02 → 4234.88] Oh it's not gonna line up
[4234.88 → 4235.92] The timing's not quite right
[4235.92 → 4237.88] I was so close
[4237.88 → 4239.44] I got an original Switch
[4239.44 → 4240.68] And I started Breath of the Wild
[4240.68 → 4242.46] When I had my bottom wisdom teeth out
[4242.46 → 4244.70] Because I knew that I was going to be stuck in bed
[4244.70 → 4245.90] With absolutely nowhere to go
[4245.90 → 4246.70] And nothing to do
[4246.70 → 4247.00] Yeah
[4247.00 → 4247.64] So I was like oh
[4247.64 → 4249.06] I'm going to get a Switch
[4249.06 → 4250.70] And I'm going to play Breath of the Wild
[4250.70 → 4253.76] I am having my top wisdom teeth out
[4253.76 → 4255.62] On Sunday
[4255.62 → 4256.38] Or Monday
[4256.38 → 4258.48] And Switch 2 announcement
[4258.48 → 4260.30] But we were so close
[4260.30 → 4261.06] We were very close
[4261.06 → 4261.88] We were so close
[4261.88 → 4263.22] To me playing Switch 2
[4263.22 → 4264.60] When I got my top ones out
[4264.60 → 4265.88] So Nintendo
[4265.88 → 4267.58] Releases new game consoles
[4267.58 → 4268.60] On a schedule
[4268.60 → 4269.00] That is
[4269.00 → 4270.46] Approximately aligned
[4270.46 → 4271.34] With whenever Linus
[4271.34 → 4272.82] Needs a major tooth extraction
[4272.82 → 4276.28] Man if you don't get another one
[4276.28 → 4277.06] They're just never gonna release
[4277.06 → 4277.64] Another console
[4277.64 → 4280.32] I
[4280.32 → 4282.40] Did I ever send you a picture
[4282.40 → 4282.98] Of what I did
[4282.98 → 4284.62] During my wisdom teeth thing
[4284.62 → 4285.50] Because I got bored
[4285.50 → 4287.84] I don't know
[4287.84 → 4289.54] I remember you doing too much
[4289.54 → 4290.22] Yeah
[4290.22 → 4291.90] Because you're Luke
[4291.90 → 4292.36] Yeah
[4292.36 → 4293.54] That was a given
[4293.54 → 4294.52] God you're dumb sometimes
[4294.52 → 4296.40] I had
[4296.40 → 4298.46] Emma help me with this actually
[4298.46 → 4300.26] But she wanted me to keep it
[4300.26 → 4300.86] Just so I
[4300.86 → 4301.54] I wouldn't have to like
[4301.54 → 4302.44] Hold it there in bed
[4302.44 → 4304.14] But we had like a scarf
[4304.14 → 4304.82] Basically
[4304.82 → 4307.28] That we had put around my head
[4307.28 → 4308.96] To keep the ice packs
[4308.96 → 4309.96] In place
[4309.96 → 4313.32] Looking like the old lady
[4313.32 → 4313.78] With the
[4313.78 → 4314.28] Yeah
[4314.28 → 4315.16] So I just
[4315.16 → 4316.28] I just did like a
[4316.28 → 4317.28] Better version
[4317.28 → 4319.04] Strapping it to my head
[4319.04 → 4319.44] Essentially
[4319.44 → 4320.20] And then
[4320.20 → 4321.66] Found a way that my headphones
[4321.66 → 4322.50] Could
[4322.50 → 4324.02] Could fit over it
[4324.02 → 4324.66] And then
[4324.66 → 4326.34] Instead of spending it all in bed
[4326.34 → 4326.90] I just like
[4326.90 → 4327.96] Sat at the computer
[4327.96 → 4328.90] And played games
[4328.90 → 4329.80] With this
[4329.80 → 4331.84] Contraption strapped to my head
[4331.84 → 4335.76] And it was awesome
[4335.76 → 4337.26] You are such a brilliant idiot
[4337.26 → 4341.38] It was great
[4341.38 → 4344.30] Imagine having such great mental capacity
[4344.30 → 4346.24] And using it for that
[4346.24 → 4351.98] Much innovation
[4351.98 → 4352.70] Oh yeah
[4352.70 → 4353.30] Absolutely
[4353.30 → 4355.46] Our other question is
[4355.46 → 4356.12] What do you think
[4356.12 → 4357.48] This C button is for
[4357.48 → 4359.76] I've seen
[4359.76 → 4362.64] What are some of the
[4362.64 → 4364.10] Camera is something
[4364.10 → 4364.80] That it stood for
[4364.80 → 4366.36] On previous Nintendo consoles
[4366.36 → 4367.98] It could be connecting
[4367.98 → 4369.08] Like if they have
[4369.08 → 4370.68] Like a Wii U type feature
[4370.68 → 4371.60] Where you can
[4371.60 → 4372.84] Remotely stream it
[4372.84 → 4374.78] I would love
[4374.78 → 4376.30] I would love
[4376.30 → 4377.34] If they bring back
[4377.34 → 4377.98] Streaming
[4377.98 → 4380.06] And there is
[4380.06 → 4380.86] One
[4380.86 → 4382.84] Somewhat credible
[4382.84 → 4383.80] It seems pretty credible
[4383.80 → 4384.14] Actually
[4384.14 → 4385.48] There's one credible rumour
[4385.48 → 4386.82] That would seem to suggest
[4386.82 → 4387.50] That they might
[4387.50 → 4389.14] Because it looks like
[4389.14 → 4390.16] It's not a C stick guys
[4390.16 → 4391.32] No yeah it's not
[4391.32 → 4392.28] It looks like
[4392.28 → 4394.62] The Ampere generation GPU
[4394.62 → 4395.82] That it allegedly
[4395.82 → 4396.46] Might
[4396.46 → 4397.60] Allegedly have
[4397.60 → 4399.00] Is not equipped
[4399.00 → 4400.36] With an Ampere generation
[4400.36 → 4401.38] Media encoder
[4401.38 → 4403.42] It has a newer one
[4403.42 → 4404.06] Oh
[4404.06 → 4405.44] And so the only reason
[4405.44 → 4406.32] That I could think of
[4406.32 → 4407.24] Why you would bother
[4407.24 → 4407.86] With that
[4407.86 → 4408.84] Yeah
[4408.84 → 4409.60] Is for
[4409.60 → 4410.44] Either locally
[4410.44 → 4411.22] Recording gameplay
[4411.22 → 4411.90] Which
[4411.90 → 4413.02] I don't know man
[4413.02 → 4413.86] That seems kind of
[4413.86 → 4414.70] Far-fetched to me
[4414.70 → 4415.98] Or
[4415.98 → 4418.54] Streaming
[4418.54 → 4419.14] Yeah
[4419.14 → 4419.96] Streaming wirelessly
[4419.96 → 4421.58] That'd be pretty cool
[4421.58 → 4422.22] I'd be into that
[4422.22 → 4422.70] Interesting
[4422.70 → 4426.20] We've got a
[4426.20 → 4427.48] Comment from Dot Justin
[4427.48 → 4428.60] In the float plane chat
[4428.60 → 4429.22] Linus
[4429.22 → 4430.52] Get Sammy to vlog
[4430.52 → 4431.50] Your wisdom teeth

[4436.84 → 4438.58] Oh you don't even know dude
[4438.58 → 4440.36] We can't even say really
[4440.36 → 4441.54] What
[4441.54 → 4442.30] Huh
[4442.30 → 4442.80] Is there something
[4442.80 → 4443.66] I don't know about
[4443.66 → 4444.02] Oh I
[4444.02 → 4445.26] No I think
[4445.26 → 4446.12] I don't know
[4446.12 → 4447.10] I'm just going to stop
[4447.10 → 4448.36] I don't know how much
[4448.36 → 4448.84] I can say without
[4448.84 → 4449.38] Getting in trouble
[4449.38 → 4450.28] From somebody
[4450.28 → 4450.96] From somewhere
[4450.96 → 4451.80] Oh okay
[4451.80 → 4452.48] I'm just going to stop
[4452.48 → 4453.02] Well anyway
[4453.02 → 4453.92] Yeah
[4453.92 → 4455.66] So Sammy is apparently
[4455.66 → 4457.10] Doing a vlog
[4457.10 → 4457.98] Of me getting my
[4457.98 → 4458.74] Wisdom teeth out
[4458.74 → 4459.12] Yeah
[4459.12 → 4459.82] And
[4459.82 → 4462.10] There's a major
[4462.10 → 4463.32] Hardware release
[4463.32 → 4464.04] That
[4464.04 → 4466.30] I will not be able
[4466.30 → 4467.24] To be involved in
[4467.24 → 4469.20] And
[4469.20 → 4470.60] My understanding
[4470.60 → 4471.32] Is that Sammy
[4471.32 → 4472.18] Will also be getting
[4472.18 → 4472.64] A clip
[4472.64 → 4473.64] Of me
[4473.64 → 4475.64] Participating
[4475.64 → 4476.52] In the only way
[4476.52 → 4477.16] That I can
[4477.16 → 4477.82] With my mouth
[4477.82 → 4478.72] All like swollen
[4478.72 → 4479.76] And disgusting
[4479.76 → 4480.84] That's what I was avoiding
[4480.84 → 4481.12] Saying
[4481.12 → 4481.54] Oh yeah
[4481.54 → 4481.98] No, no no
[4481.98 → 4482.28] It'll be
[4482.28 → 4482.90] I won't
[4482.90 → 4483.74] I won't say any more
[4483.74 → 4484.04] Than that
[4484.04 → 4484.36] It'll be
[4484.36 → 4485.12] Basically
[4485.12 → 4487.06] It'll be hilarious
[4487.06 → 4489.30] Don't miss our video
[4489.30 → 4489.70] Yeah
[4489.70 → 4490.04] Yeah

[4491.48 → 4492.46] Making it actually
[4492.46 → 4493.38] Just gross
[4493.38 → 4494.50] So
[4494.50 → 4495.80] Sammy says in chat
[4495.80 → 4497.00] Are you leaking about me

[4825.96 → 4826.68] While supplies last
[4826.68 → 4828.68] Oh
[4828.68 → 4829.76] Oh
[4829.76 → 4830.30] Finally
[4830.30 → 4831.80] Our retro
[4831.80 → 4833.18] Monitor pet caves
[4833.18 → 4834.14] Are finally back
[4834.14 → 4835.24] Our first dock
[4835.24 → 4836.74] I forget how many
[4836.74 → 4837.38] Was in our first order
[4837.38 → 4837.90] I want to say like
[4837.90 → 4838.94] 400 units or something
[4838.94 → 4839.34] I don't know
[4839.34 → 4839.94] It was gone in like
[4839.94 → 4840.66] A day
[4840.66 → 4841.28] Oh it was more than
[4841.28 → 4841.68] That was like
[4841.68 → 4842.22] Four grand
[4842.22 → 4842.76] More
[4842.76 → 4843.26] What?
[4843.46 → 4843.78] Units?
[4843.92 → 4844.70] Yeah it was a lot
[4844.70 → 4845.28] No
[4845.28 → 4845.74] Yeah
[4845.74 → 4846.24] No
[4846.24 → 4846.96] I thought we went
[4846.96 → 4848.06] Pretty low on that order
[4848.06 → 4848.64] Oh maybe it was
[4848.64 → 4849.16] The second one
[4849.16 → 4849.88] No I think we went
[4849.88 → 4850.30] Conservative
[4850.30 → 4850.88] Okay
[4850.88 → 4851.34] Anyway
[4851.34 → 4852.14] They sold out
[4852.14 → 4852.80] 500 apparently
[4852.80 → 4853.36] They sold out
[4853.36 → 4854.72] Super fast
[4854.72 → 4856.14] And then we went
[4856.14 → 4856.94] To reorder them
[4856.94 → 4858.14] And the top of
[4858.14 → 4858.82] Production sample
[4858.82 → 4859.40] That we got back
[4859.40 → 4860.00] From the factory
[4860.00 → 4862.14] Was unrecognizable
[4862.14 → 4863.70] It looked nothing
[4863.70 → 4864.60] Like the first order
[4864.60 → 4866.16] And that is why
[4866.16 → 4866.88] You do a top of
[4866.88 → 4867.72] Production sample
[4867.72 → 4869.24] Before you do
[4869.24 → 4869.96] The mass production
[4869.96 → 4872.44] So we have new ones
[4872.44 → 4873.94] In that look great
[4873.94 → 4874.78] They are up to
[4874.78 → 4875.70] The standards of quality
[4875.70 → 4876.48] From the original one
[4876.48 → 4877.38] Which my cats
[4877.38 → 4878.74] Absolutely love
[4878.74 → 4879.16] Mine too
[4879.16 → 4880.84] It's got the same
[4880.84 → 4882.20] Awesome pillow inside
[4882.20 → 4883.00] That has either
[4883.00 → 4884.14] A fuzzy side
[4884.14 → 4885.16] If you prefer
[4885.16 → 4885.94] Softness
[4885.94 → 4886.62] Or
[4886.62 → 4888.28] An easier to clean
[4888.28 → 4889.22] Sleeker side
[4889.22 → 4889.86] If you prefer
[4889.86 → 4890.92] It being easier
[4890.92 → 4891.26] To clean
[4891.26 → 4892.28] And we hedged
[4892.28 → 4893.06] We hedged
[4893.06 → 4893.92] And for the sides
[4893.92 → 4894.36] We went with
[4894.36 → 4895.14] The easier to clean
[4895.14 → 4895.70] Material
[4895.70 → 4897.10] That goes inside
[4897.10 → 4899.14] It has little dates
[4899.14 → 4899.88] On the bottom
[4899.88 → 4900.36] To make it
[4900.36 → 4900.86] So it doesn't
[4900.86 → 4901.78] Slip around as easily
[4901.78 → 4902.16] I mean
[4902.16 → 4902.90] Realistically
[4902.90 → 4904.34] If your pet
[4904.34 → 4905.20] Dives into it
[4905.20 → 4905.64] It's still going to
[4905.64 → 4906.16] Move or whatever
[4906.16 → 4907.00] And it's designed
[4907.00 → 4907.86] To look like a retro
[4907.86 → 4908.66] CRT monitor
[4908.66 → 4909.36] It's so cute
[4909.36 → 4910.22] It's available
[4910.22 → 4910.66] In the store
[4910.66 → 4911.40] Minor
[4911.40 → 4912.96] Potential problem
[4912.96 → 4914.10] With the backpack pin
[4914.10 → 4915.38] We have pin collectors
[4915.38 → 4915.84] That try to get
[4915.84 → 4916.42] All the pins
[4916.42 → 4916.78] That come up
[4916.78 → 4917.24] On the store
[4917.24 → 4918.24] A lot of those
[4918.24 → 4918.80] Pin collectors
[4918.80 → 4919.94] Already own the backpack
[4919.94 → 4922.34] Oh do they have any
[4922.34 → 4923.10] Friends who need a backpack
[4923.10 → 4924.00] Well
[4924.00 → 4924.26] I
[4924.26 → 4925.08] I
[4925.08 → 4929.70] I don't know
[4929.70 → 4930.64] How to deal with that
[4930.64 → 4931.10] I don't know
[4931.10 → 4931.50] Maybe
[4931.50 → 4933.72] Maybe we could
[4933.72 → 4934.40] Hold some
[4934.40 → 4934.76] In
[4934.76 → 4935.34] Tell you what
[4935.34 → 4936.22] I have no idea
[4936.22 → 4937.06] Maybe just something
[4937.06 → 4937.54] To think about
[4937.54 → 4938.28] I offer
[4938.28 → 4939.58] We hold
[4939.58 → 4940.68] A handful of them
[4940.68 → 4941.28] In reserve
[4941.28 → 4942.38] For the next pin drop
[4942.38 → 4943.94] You offer
[4943.94 → 4945.76] Acceptance
[4945.76 → 4946.64] Of that
[4946.64 → 4947.70] Is that acceptable
[4947.70 → 4948.30] Could we do that
[4948.30 → 4949.78] I'll have to wait
[4949.78 → 4950.10] For
[4950.10 → 4950.42] Okay
[4950.42 → 4951.40] For the pin people
[4951.40 → 4951.78] To

[4955.02 → 4955.76] Throw

[4958.08 → 4958.42] Or something
[4958.42 → 4958.86] Like that
[4958.86 → 4959.44] Could be maybe
[4959.44 → 4959.92] Throw that at
[4959.92 → 4960.08] Nick
[4960.08 → 4960.72] Maybe we hold
[4960.72 → 4961.22] Hold back
[4961.22 → 4961.96] Like some
[4961.96 → 4962.82] And then
[4962.82 → 4963.30] We make them

[4963.58 → 4964.34] Artie for that

[4999.48 → 4999.96] That if someone
[4999.96 → 5000.66] Has a backpack
[5000.66 → 5001.32] They could send
[5001.32 → 5001.94] Proof of purchase
[5001.94 → 5002.64] And then we could
[5002.64 → 5003.10] Make the pin

[5012.54 → 5012.82] And I know
[5012.82 → 5013.28] The idea
[5013.28 → 5013.78] Behind this

[5059.94 → 5060.38] It's an
[5060.38 → 5060.84] Amphibian
[5060.84 → 5061.26] It's fine
[5061.26 → 5062.62] Um
[5062.62 → 5064.08] Lizard
[5064.08 → 5064.72] I'm just
[5064.72 → 5065.12] I'm waiting
[5065.12 → 5065.58] For Reddit
[5065.58 → 5066.00] To correct
[5066.00 → 5066.18] Me
[5066.18 → 5067.78] Um
[5067.78 → 5068.64] Let me
[5068.64 → 5068.90] Think
[5068.90 → 5070.66] No not
[5070.66 → 5071.26] Dinosaur
[5071.26 → 5072.00] They're birds
[5072.00 → 5073.30] We think
[5073.30 → 5073.74] We're not
[5073.74 → 5073.92] Sure
[5073.92 → 5075.58] Mark
[5075.58 → 5076.20] Zuckerberg
[5076.20 → 5081.26] He
[5081.26 → 5081.40] He
[5081.40 → 5081.94] He
[5081.94 → 5082.18] Got
[5082.18 → 5082.74] The
[5082.74 → 5083.38] 2.0
[5083.38 → 5083.76] Update
[5083.76 → 5084.18] That's
[5084.18 → 5084.58] True
[5084.58 → 5085.14] This
[5085.14 → 5085.32] Is
[5085.32 → 5085.70] True
[5085.70 → 5085.88] We
[5085.88 → 5086.06] Hired
[5086.06 → 5086.20] A
[5086.20 → 5086.56] Brand
[5086.56 → 5087.24] Consultant
[5087.24 → 5087.70] Finally
[5087.70 → 5088.30] Yeah
[5088.30 → 5088.72] And
[5088.72 → 5088.82] They
[5088.82 → 5089.34] Even
[5089.34 → 5089.70] I
[5089.70 → 5089.84] Should
[5089.84 → 5090.06] Ask
[5090.06 → 5090.18] Who
[5090.18 → 5090.42] Is
[5090.42 → 5090.56] And
[5090.56 → 5090.98] Get
[5090.98 → 5091.10] His
[5091.10 → 5091.42] Contact
[5091.42 → 5095.36] Next time I appear on tonight's show if I get a chance
[5095.36 → 5098.96] Why would Mark be your favourite?
[5099.30 → 5100.92] Because it's a funny answer
[5100.92 → 5103.66] Sometimes we give you guys a serious answer
[5103.66 → 5107.08] Sometimes we just think of the most outlandish thing we can say
[5107.08 → 5108.06] And blurt it out
[5108.06 → 5111.02] And I'll let you guys sort out which one is which
[5111.02 → 5113.72] I don't know, I'm looking into what
[5113.72 → 5116.06] I googled reptiles
[5116.06 → 5118.54] And one of the things that came up was birds
[5118.54 → 5120.04] You googled reptiles?
[5120.04 → 5121.74] Yeah, I wanted to see a bunch of different examples
[5121.74 → 5122.84] You have to google reptiles
[5122.84 → 5124.34] Snake, iguana, turtle
[5124.34 → 5125.56] I know some of them, but I was like
[5125.56 → 5128.92] What are some random off-the-wall ones that I wouldn't necessarily think of?
[5128.96 → 5131.12] I have to say, I'm not really a reptile guy
[5131.12 → 5133.22] This is why I googled it
[5133.22 → 5135.90] Again, I know some examples
[5135.90 → 5137.88] I think they're cool
[5137.88 → 5139.14] Which is cool
[5139.14 → 5140.90] I had an iguana when I was a kid
[5140.90 → 5143.54] We just ended up with one by accident
[5143.54 → 5145.06] Someone was rehoming one
[5145.06 → 5146.96] Because that's what tends to happen to them
[5146.96 → 5150.46] And they don't have a mammal
[5150.46 → 5152.86] Or an avian brain
[5152.86 → 5160.46] They don't have an instinct to socialize with humans
[5160.46 → 5160.98] They just
[5160.98 → 5163.34] I mean, yeah, they're cold-blooded
[5163.34 → 5163.88] You know?
[5164.98 → 5167.50] They're not really very interactive from my experience
[5167.50 → 5169.92] Although, I mean, you hear snake owners that are super happy
[5169.92 → 5171.78] They love their snakes and stuff
[5171.78 → 5173.30] Mr. Dank pods
[5173.30 → 5174.54] Yeah
[5174.54 → 5179.44] Alright, Mike D78
[5179.44 → 5182.34] Linus isn't really a reptile guy
[5182.34 → 5184.48] Does that mean he has a reptile dysfunction?
[5186.40 → 5187.72] Can I ding other people?
[5187.92 → 5188.68] I think you can
[5188.68 → 5189.76] I think when it's that good
[5189.76 → 5191.46] You can ding the thing
[5191.46 → 5192.38] You have to do it
[5192.38 → 5192.66] Alright
[5192.66 → 5194.80] Very good, very good, very good
[5194.80 → 5197.94] I'll go with sea turtles
[5197.94 → 5199.14] Skink
[5199.14 → 5199.94] Okay
[5199.94 → 5200.74] Okay
[5200.74 → 5202.06] That's a pretty
[5202.06 → 5205.26] That's a pretty uncontroversial take
[5205.26 → 5205.70] Yeah
[5205.70 → 5206.86] I'm going to go with
[5206.86 → 5209.66] Especially the ones from Finding Nemo
[5209.66 → 5212.56] So the ones that are like surfer dudes?
[5212.80 → 5213.00] Brush
[5213.00 → 5213.80] Yeah, man
[5213.80 → 5214.30] Brush
[5214.30 → 5215.02] Let's go
[5215.02 → 5215.60] Fine
[5215.60 → 5216.38] Alright
[5216.38 → 5218.46] I'm going to go with red-eared slider
[5218.46 → 5222.34] I'm going to go with a much smaller turtle
[5222.34 → 5223.28] Cool, okay
[5223.28 → 5226.40] Yeah, I actually also had a few turtles when I was a kid
[5226.40 → 5228.06] Looking back
[5228.06 → 5229.38] Man, what didn't you have?
[5229.46 → 5230.86] We went through a lot of pets
[5230.86 → 5231.72] Yeah, I was like
[5231.72 → 5234.06] I've heard a lot of stories of pets
[5234.06 → 5235.00] I've never heard of that one
[5235.00 → 5237.80] I don't know what happened to them
[5237.80 → 5238.50] Oh
[5238.50 → 5240.66] Like I don't remember
[5240.66 → 5241.72] No, I just don't remember
[5241.72 → 5243.28] Like you don't eat them
[5243.28 → 5243.82] Like it's
[5243.82 → 5246.30] This was at my dad's house when I was younger
[5246.30 → 5250.06] This wasn't like on the farm where I had a pet goat
[5250.06 → 5251.78] And was tricked into eating it
[5251.78 → 5253.28] No, that was a completely different thing
[5253.28 → 5254.50] Yeah, you don't eat the good one
[5254.50 → 5257.70] Yeah, so we had Shelly and
[5257.70 → 5260.24] I want to say like Igor or something
[5260.24 → 5261.26] Because, I don't know
[5261.26 → 5262.02] He had like a weird
[5262.02 → 5263.20] Was Shelly the turtle?
[5265.90 → 5267.52] Anyway, I think there were either two or three
[5267.52 → 5269.06] And what I liked about them
[5269.06 → 5270.74] Was we think of turtles as slow
[5270.74 → 5272.22] Or at least tortoises anyway
[5272.22 → 5272.82] Oh, yeah, dude
[5272.82 → 5273.22] They can
[5273.22 → 5274.22] They
[5274.22 → 5275.66] Freaking rip
[5275.66 → 5276.56] They can rip
[5276.56 → 5279.26] You have ever seen a goldfish like swim kind of fast?
[5279.54 → 5280.82] You have ever seen a turtle
[5280.82 → 5282.08] Reach out
[5282.08 → 5283.76] Bite down on it
[5283.76 → 5286.60] And then have the tail and head fall down on both sides of the mouth?
[5287.14 → 5287.42] No
[5287.42 → 5289.02] I have
[5289.02 → 5289.66] Wow
[5289.66 → 5290.50] Yeah, they go, dude
[5290.50 → 5290.98] They go
[5290.98 → 5292.28] They freaking go
[5292.28 → 5293.50] What was the goldfish's name?
[5293.98 → 5294.56] Uh, no, no
[5294.56 → 5295.40] They were feeder fish
[5295.40 → 5296.12] Goldie?
[5296.50 → 5296.78] No, no
[5296.78 → 5297.38] They're feeder fish
[5297.38 → 5298.74] You don't name a feeder fish
[5298.74 → 5299.48] What's your problem?
[5299.82 → 5300.82] What's wrong with you?
[5302.42 → 5304.42] That would be terrible
[5304.42 → 5306.42] Someone probably does it
[5306.42 → 5307.80] Uh
[5307.80 → 5309.08] Next one
[5309.08 → 5309.56] Sure
[5309.56 → 5310.54] Hey, Linus
[5310.54 → 5312.02] I'm new to PC building
[5312.02 → 5313.78] And I instantly fell in love with it
[5313.78 → 5316.30] But I want to actually understand how the parts work
[5316.30 → 5318.38] And I'm struggling to find good sources
[5318.38 → 5320.54] Any recommendations for learning?
[5320.96 → 5321.16] Oh
[5321.16 → 5322.36] Ball sack
[5322.36 → 5322.90] What's that?

[5326.50 → 5326.84] Oh, yeah

[5352.86 → 5354.44] They get into like
[5354.44 → 5355.06] No, really
[5355.06 → 5355.42] Like
[5355.42 → 5356.50] Like how does
[5356.50 → 5357.18] How does it

[5367.90 → 5370.38] Question for Linus
[5370.38 → 5372.16] Did anyone behind the scenes
[5372.16 → 5374.58] Try to talk you out of wearing socks and sandals
[5374.58 → 5375.88] On network television?
[5376.10 → 5377.14] On the contrary
[5377.14 → 5378.98] I was 50-50
[5378.98 → 5379.44] Oh
[5379.44 → 5382.16] I would have had to replace my
[5382.16 → 5383.86] So the only two pairs of footwork
[5383.86 → 5384.52] Not footwork
[5384.52 → 5385.16] Sorry
[5385.16 → 5386.20] I have some badminton on the brain
[5386.20 → 5387.90] The only two pairs of footwear that I own
[5387.90 → 5389.82] Other than my badminton shoes
[5389.82 → 5391.20] And my like
[5391.20 → 5392.16] Rain boots
[5392.16 → 5393.24] And my hiking boots
[5393.24 → 5393.48] You know
[5393.48 → 5394.90] Like utility shoes
[5394.90 → 5396.28] I have a pair of dress shoes
[5396.28 → 5396.92] But they're like
[5396.92 → 5398.22] Super basic
[5398.22 → 5400.54] Are my vessels
[5400.54 → 5401.38] So I have my sandals
[5401.38 → 5402.10] And I have my vessels
[5402.10 → 5402.84] Those are the only two
[5402.84 → 5404.78] Like daily driver footwears that I have
[5404.78 → 5405.66] But my vessels
[5405.66 → 5406.38] Are
[5406.38 → 5408.84] Scuffed
[5408.84 → 5410.46] You've had them for a long time
[5410.46 → 5411.04] Yep
[5411.04 → 5411.68] Yep
[5411.68 → 5412.32] So
[5412.32 → 5413.98] Are those the ones you wore to Tiffany's?
[5414.24 → 5415.70] This is primer
[5415.70 → 5416.12] Probably
[5416.12 → 5416.60] Yes
[5416.60 → 5417.92] I wore these
[5417.92 → 5418.66] To Tiffany
[5418.66 → 5418.90] Alright
[5418.90 → 5419.90] Yeah, we didn't get to see them
[5419.90 → 5420.66] When you were talking about that
[5420.66 → 5421.14] That's paint
[5421.14 → 5421.60] And oh no
[5421.60 → 5422.16] That's primer
[5422.16 → 5423.52] This is from
[5423.52 → 5425.36] Priming James's
[5425.36 → 5426.56] Like writing lead
[5426.56 → 5429.02] James's kitchen cabinets
[5429.02 → 5432.16] He asked very nicely
[5432.16 → 5433.92] To use my new fancy sprayer
[5433.92 → 5435.14] And my spray booth
[5435.14 → 5436.16] And then
[5436.16 → 5437.74] I ended up
[5437.74 → 5439.18] I didn't
[5439.18 → 5439.70] Well I didn't
[5439.70 → 5440.32] No, no, no, no, no
[5440.32 → 5441.86] He did most of it
[5441.86 → 5442.86] After like the first day
[5442.86 → 5443.84] But I was like
[5443.84 → 5445.04] I like showed him how it works
[5445.04 → 5445.56] And I was like
[5445.56 → 5447.28] See you later
[5447.28 → 5447.86] He's like
[5447.86 → 5450.76] Okay, okay
[5450.76 → 5452.12] I guess I'm helping get things going
[5452.12 → 5453.50] But that's what I'm saying
[5453.50 → 5453.96] You know what
[5453.96 → 5453.98] You know what
[5453.98 → 5454.36] You know what
[5454.36 → 5455.42] It was actually fun
[5455.42 → 5457.66] Because people don't ask me
[5457.66 → 5459.56] People never ask me
[5459.56 → 5460.00] To like
[5460.00 → 5461.42] Help them move
[5461.42 → 5462.34] Or like
[5462.34 → 5464.74] Do guy stuff
[5464.74 → 5465.46] Together
[5465.46 → 5466.32] Like when they have
[5466.32 → 5466.72] You know
[5466.72 → 5467.74] A project that needs to be done
[5467.74 → 5468.56] Even you don't do it
[5468.56 → 5469.30] I don't
[5469.30 → 5469.54] You
[5469.54 → 5470.20] Need much
[5470.20 → 5470.86] Okay, that's true
[5470.86 → 5472.24] Anyway
[5472.24 → 5472.64] Oh man
[5472.64 → 5473.04] These things
[5473.04 → 5473.78] These things are terrible
[5473.78 → 5474.34] Look at the bottom
[5474.34 → 5475.80] I am fairly certain
[5475.80 → 5476.58] That it used to say
[5476.58 → 5477.82] Messi somewhere on the bottom
[5477.82 → 5481.00] I can't even imagine where
[5481.00 → 5483.60] I don't see it at all
[5483.60 → 5484.94] Oh, here it is
[5484.94 → 5486.72] Oh, wow
[5486.72 → 5486.98] Yeah
[5486.98 → 5487.84] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[5487.84 → 5488.32] You can tell
[5488.32 → 5489.28] Because the triangles aren't there
[5489.28 → 5489.94] That makes sense
[5489.94 → 5491.14] That used to say
[5491.14 → 5491.88] That used to say
[5491.88 → 5492.20] Messi
[5492.20 → 5493.36] It just looked particularly
[5493.36 → 5494.78] More worn than the rest of it
[5494.78 → 5495.68] Yeah, you can really see
[5495.68 → 5496.72] You can really see my
[5496.72 → 5497.44] I'm sure
[5497.44 → 5498.04] I'm sure
[5498.04 → 5499.12] Oh, man
[5499.12 → 5500.48] Every time
[5500.48 → 5501.56] I get like
[5501.56 → 5502.88] I get medical analysis
[5502.88 → 5504.22] Of like anything
[5504.22 → 5504.70] That I taught
[5504.70 → 5505.72] I'm sure that the foot
[5505.72 → 5506.72] Experts out there
[5506.72 → 5507.94] Are sending me
[5507.94 → 5509.06] Sending me DMs
[5509.06 → 5510.10] On the forum right now
[5510.10 → 5510.80] You should get some
[5510.80 → 5511.68] Well, you probably
[5511.68 → 5512.26] Don't actually have
[5512.26 → 5513.16] This problem that much
[5513.16 → 5513.78] Because of your
[5513.78 → 5514.22] My gait
[5514.22 → 5515.32] Your sandal usage
[5515.32 → 5516.20] But I've been trying
[5516.20 → 5516.88] To look into like
[5516.88 → 5518.08] Wide toe box shoes
[5518.08 → 5518.66] Anyway
[5518.66 → 5519.14] That's a whole
[5519.14 → 5519.40] Anyway
[5519.40 → 5520.22] I was on the fence
[5520.22 → 5521.24] I was 50-50
[5521.24 → 5521.66] I was like
[5521.66 → 5522.08] There's no way
[5522.08 → 5523.00] I can wear these on the show
[5523.00 → 5523.34] I would
[5523.34 → 5524.44] I don't have time
[5524.44 → 5525.24] To get new ones
[5525.24 → 5526.48] So I'd have to just like
[5526.48 → 5527.70] Go get something
[5527.70 → 5528.42] In the morning of
[5528.42 → 5529.30] Do that to Messi
[5529.30 → 5529.88] To be honest
[5529.88 → 5531.28] Yeah, right
[5531.28 → 5531.66] Yeah
[5531.66 → 5532.76] It's not really fair
[5532.76 → 5533.28] And then I was like
[5533.28 → 5533.94] But realistically
[5533.94 → 5534.40] Like
[5534.40 → 5535.58] I don't know
[5535.58 → 5536.24] It's kind of part
[5536.24 → 5536.76] Of the shtick
[5536.76 → 5537.40] It's kind of part
[5537.40 → 5537.98] Of the character
[5537.98 → 5539.12] To do the socks
[5539.12 → 5539.84] And sandals thing
[5539.84 → 5540.32] Because I
[5540.32 → 5541.18] Unironically
[5541.18 → 5542.62] Do really like
[5542.62 → 5543.98] That style of footwear
[5543.98 → 5545.02] Well, I don't like the style
[5545.02 → 5546.16] What I like is the comfort
[5546.16 → 5547.56] You know
[5547.56 → 5548.66] They're comfortable
[5548.66 → 5550.18] They're warm enough
[5550.18 → 5551.32] But super breathable
[5551.32 → 5552.66] Nothing beats the breathability
[5552.66 → 5554.08] Of a completely open shoe
[5554.08 → 5555.22] And then it was actually
[5555.22 → 5555.74] Nick Light
[5555.74 → 5557.60] The Creed Warehouse Nick
[5557.60 → 5558.56] Who was like
[5558.56 → 5560.02] If you don't do it
[5560.02 → 5560.48] I'll riot
[5560.48 → 5562.34] So I was like
[5562.34 → 5562.70] Okay
[5562.70 → 5563.38] Alright
[5563.38 → 5564.22] Let's go Nick
[5564.22 → 5564.68] And then
[5564.68 → 5565.06] And then
[5565.06 → 5565.66] Obviously
[5565.66 → 5566.40] I wanted to put on
[5566.40 → 5567.24] The prototype socks
[5567.24 → 5567.82] So that
[5567.82 → 5568.86] They're perfect
[5568.86 → 5570.00] I don't know
[5570.00 → 5570.60] If they're done, done
[5570.60 → 5571.20] But they're
[5571.20 → 5572.12] We're getting there
[5572.12 → 5574.66] They aren't the same
[5574.66 → 5576.04] As my Darn Toughs
[5576.04 → 5577.28] But what they are
[5577.28 → 5578.78] Is also perfect
[5578.78 → 5580.54] In slightly different ways
[5580.54 → 5580.98] Sure
[5580.98 → 5581.70] And
[5581.70 → 5583.26] And I'm
[5583.26 → 5583.82] I'm pretty excited
[5583.82 → 5584.60] Are you going with the
[5584.60 → 5585.94] Like it has to not be worse
[5585.94 → 5587.36] Yeah
[5587.36 → 5588.70] I don't expect to beat them
[5588.70 → 5589.48] Darn Tough makes
[5589.48 → 5591.12] Outstanding socks
[5591.12 → 5591.92] And I would never say
[5591.92 → 5592.68] A negative thing
[5592.68 → 5593.42] About the quality
[5593.42 → 5594.08] Of their product
[5594.08 → 5594.94] Period
[5594.94 → 5596.04] Regardless of whether
[5596.04 → 5596.76] We're a competitor
[5596.76 → 5597.26] Or whatever
[5597.26 → 5598.38] And right now we're not
[5598.38 → 5599.36] But we'd like to be
[5599.36 → 5601.46] But that doesn't change
[5601.46 → 5602.16] The fact that they make
[5602.16 → 5603.66] A darn good sock
[5603.66 → 5605.78] And Tough
[5605.78 → 5608.22] Do it
[5608.22 → 5609.94] It applies to him too
[5609.94 → 5611.62] Give me Dan
[5611.62 → 5614.34] Holy shrikes
[5614.34 → 5614.96] Are there ever
[5614.96 → 5615.84] A lot of merch messages
[5615.84 → 5616.54] I think we're doing
[5616.54 → 5617.02] I think we're doing
[5617.02 → 5617.54] Another one too
[5617.54 → 5618.06] What the heck are you
[5618.06 → 5618.70] People buying
[5618.70 → 5619.48] Are they all pins
[5619.48 → 5620.68] Yeah lots of pins
[5620.68 → 5621.72] Oh
[5621.72 → 5623.14] Alright that makes sense
[5623.14 → 5624.22] Do you want another one
[5624.22 → 5624.50] Dude
[5624.50 → 5626.20] People like pins
[5626.20 → 5627.40] I can see that
[5627.40 → 5628.94] People also like
[5628.94 → 5629.88] Precision screwdrivers
[5629.88 → 5630.50] And bit cases
[5630.50 → 5632.10] And northern lights
[5632.10 → 5632.44] Desk pads
[5632.44 → 5632.88] Wow actually
[5632.88 → 5633.32] There's a lot of
[5633.32 → 5633.98] Variety today
[5633.98 → 5634.62] Interesting
[5634.62 → 5636.48] Oh pet caves
[5636.48 → 5637.28] Yeah pet caves
[5637.28 → 5638.12] Get them pet caves
[5638.12 → 5638.92] Couch potato hoodies
[5638.92 → 5639.94] Okay yeah I'm just curious
[5639.94 → 5640.66] Alright next up
[5640.66 → 5641.14] Okay Dan hit me
[5641.14 → 5642.52] Hey LLD
[5642.52 → 5643.36] Last week you mentioned
[5643.36 → 5644.02] We're moving away
[5644.02 → 5645.36] From common GPU framework
[5645.36 → 5646.16] That all vendors
[5646.16 → 5646.84] Could use
[5646.84 → 5648.60] Would an open standard
[5648.60 → 5650.04] That could make use
[5650.04 → 5650.96] Of Nvidia Tensor
[5650.96 → 5652.36] And AMD Intel cores
[5652.36 → 5653.18] Be possible
[5653.18 → 5654.14] Well I think
[5654.14 → 5655.38] Like we've seen
[5655.38 → 5656.16] In the past
[5656.16 → 5657.44] We're going to start
[5657.44 → 5658.22] With
[5658.22 → 5658.94] Like we saw
[5658.94 → 5659.60] With G-Sync
[5659.60 → 5660.10] For instance
[5660.10 → 5661.40] We're going to start
[5661.40 → 5662.26] With vendor
[5662.26 → 5663.98] Proprietary implementations
[5663.98 → 5665.54] And then over time
[5665.54 → 5666.26] We're going to watch
[5666.26 → 5667.12] The rest of the industry
[5667.12 → 5668.16] Play catch up
[5668.16 → 5669.66] And at such point
[5669.66 → 5670.78] As they play catch up
[5670.78 → 5671.48] Well enough
[5671.48 → 5672.94] The proprietary standard
[5672.94 → 5674.24] Will become meaningless
[5674.24 → 5674.82] And go away
[5674.82 → 5675.84] That is
[5675.84 → 5676.88] Kind of
[5676.88 → 5678.64] Our best case scenario
[5678.64 → 5680.04] It's like
[5680.04 → 5680.76] It's like with a lot
[5680.76 → 5681.30] Of this stuff right
[5681.30 → 5682.30] Like AI right now
[5682.30 → 5682.76] Everybody's talking
[5682.76 → 5683.60] About AI all the time
[5683.60 → 5684.16] To the point where
[5684.16 → 5685.76] It gets incredibly exhausting
[5685.76 → 5686.30] And annoying
[5686.30 → 5687.66] Eventually that will
[5687.66 → 5689.48] Just be part of the product
[5689.48 → 5690.38] Like I don't think
[5690.38 → 5692.02] Every single thing
[5692.02 → 5693.22] Is called smart anymore
[5693.22 → 5694.26] Because it's like
[5694.26 → 5695.14] Just kind of assumed
[5695.14 → 5695.56] Okay
[5695.56 → 5697.50] I did a retake
[5697.50 → 5698.90] On a video recently
[5698.90 → 5700.58] Because I referred
[5700.58 → 5701.10] To my phone
[5701.10 → 5701.66] As a smartphone
[5701.66 → 5702.78] And I was like
[5702.78 → 5704.26] What am I talking about
[5704.26 → 5705.18] Yeah
[5705.18 → 5706.44] What is a not smartphone
[5706.44 → 5706.72] Yeah
[5706.72 → 5707.54] Sorry
[5707.54 → 5709.52] Let's redo the clip
[5709.52 → 5712.62] I didn't even think about it
[5712.62 → 5713.82] Until that very moment
[5713.82 → 5714.06] Which was
[5714.06 → 5715.34] I think in the last week or two
[5715.34 → 5715.94] So it's funny
[5715.94 → 5716.92] That we're talking about this
[5716.92 → 5717.70] So close to it
[5717.70 → 5718.44] That is pretty interesting
[5718.44 → 5719.76] Yeah you don't say smart TV
[5719.76 → 5720.32] Yeah
[5720.32 → 5721.34] You don't say smartphone
[5721.34 → 5722.20] Well, and I've been
[5722.20 → 5722.86] I've been seeing
[5722.86 → 5723.70] You know you see ads
[5723.70 → 5724.96] Especially coming off of CES
[5724.96 → 5725.78] You see all these things
[5725.78 → 5726.40] That are claiming like
[5726.40 → 5728.52] Now with AI features
[5728.52 → 5729.54] And it's like
[5729.54 → 5730.78] This will be really cool
[5730.78 → 5731.86] When that goes away
[5731.86 → 5733.34] And it is like will
[5733.34 → 5734.10] Because eventually
[5734.10 → 5735.46] That's not going to be exciting
[5735.46 → 5735.74] Yeah
[5735.74 → 5737.02] It's not going to be a selling point
[5737.02 → 5738.12] Because you're all going to have
[5738.12 → 5739.54] The same baseline level
[5739.54 → 5740.94] Of that junk
[5740.94 → 5742.46] And then you're going to have to find
[5742.46 → 5743.94] Something else to be the selling point
[5743.94 → 5745.16] And then everyone will move on
[5745.16 → 5746.30] You know what I figured out though
[5746.30 → 5748.60] Is in a way
[5748.60 → 5750.70] I actually
[5750.70 → 5752.86] I think I get it a bit more
[5752.86 → 5753.90] Get what?
[5754.32 → 5755.92] The inclusion of that AI
[5755.92 → 5757.16] Yeah it's got AI
[5757.16 → 5757.72] It's got AI
[5757.72 → 5758.30] It's with AI
[5758.30 → 5759.32] Right now it makes sense
[5759.32 → 5759.68] Well
[5759.68 → 5762.50] Even if the AI
[5762.50 → 5763.70] Like doesn't really do that much
[5763.70 → 5764.96] Because you know what it does
[5764.96 → 5766.74] Is it tells you at a glance
[5766.74 → 5767.96] That this is the new one
[5767.96 → 5770.56] If everyone
[5770.56 → 5772.28] Is calling their latest product
[5772.28 → 5773.90] This AI
[5773.90 → 5776.02] Then if you throw AI
[5776.02 → 5777.92] On your latest model name
[5777.92 → 5779.50] You don't have to rely on
[5779.50 → 5781.14] Everyday average consumer
[5781.14 → 5782.32] To know if the
[5782.32 → 5783.36] ThinkPad
[5783.36 → 5786.84] X2695 Mark IV
[5786.84 → 5788.28] Is the latest thing
[5788.28 → 5789.82] You just need to know
[5789.82 → 5791.60] Oh it's the new AI one
[5791.60 → 5793.00] That's all you need to know
[5793.00 → 5793.50] And I guess
[5793.50 → 5795.54] From just like a completely
[5795.54 → 5797.50] Norrie branding standpoint
[5797.50 → 5800.10] I get it
[5800.10 → 5800.76] That's rough
[5800.76 → 5802.56] Even if it irritates
[5802.56 → 5803.60] Me
[5803.60 → 5804.28] The like
[5804.28 → 5805.70] Tell me how many
[5805.70 → 5807.48] Stream processes are in it
[5807.48 → 5808.40] And how much cash it has
[5808.40 → 5808.70] Guy
[5808.70 → 5810.42] Doesn't really care about that
[5810.42 → 5811.48] The worst version of that
[5811.48 → 5812.02] Was when everything
[5812.02 → 5812.70] Was called one
[5812.70 → 5815.74] That's not over
[5815.74 → 5816.90] I didn't like X
[5816.90 → 5817.78] X was my
[5817.78 → 5818.28] X was terrible
[5818.28 → 5819.56] X pissed me off
[5819.56 → 5819.96] Yeah
[5819.96 → 5820.64] Because a lot of people
[5820.64 → 5822.18] Skipped nine to go to X
[5822.18 → 5822.76] Yeah
[5822.76 → 5823.14] Like
[5823.14 → 5824.14] Oh so
[5824.14 → 5824.52] Ugh
[5824.52 → 5825.82] And then they expect you
[5825.82 → 5826.46] To say ten
[5826.46 → 5827.02] Yeah
[5827.02 → 5827.20] Yeah
[5827.20 → 5828.22] I refuse
[5828.22 → 5829.50] One is still a thing though
[5829.50 → 5830.12] Like
[5830.12 → 5830.94] Dan
[5830.94 → 5831.90] What's your phone called
[5831.90 → 5832.76] Mine is the
[5832.76 → 5833.30] One
[5833.30 → 5834.26] Five
[5834.26 → 5835.08] And they just
[5835.08 → 5835.68] No it's the
[5835.68 → 5836.38] One V
[5836.38 → 5837.04] Because the
[5837.04 → 5837.90] Second part of the
[5837.90 → 5838.56] Numbers in the
[5838.56 → 5839.28] Roman numerals
[5839.28 → 5840.18] But they also have
[5840.18 → 5840.72] The five
[5840.72 → 5841.22] So it's the
[5841.22 → 5841.92] Five
[5841.92 → 5842.76] And the five
[5842.76 → 5843.90] Is the bad one
[5843.90 → 5845.86] Sony man
[5845.86 → 5846.62] Get it together
[5846.62 → 5847.44] What are they doing
[5847.44 → 5848.36] Get it together
[5848.36 → 5848.78] Sony
[5848.78 → 5849.22] With your
[5849.22 → 5850.18] Peria phones
[5850.18 → 5853.44] We got
[5853.44 → 5855.72] Gressy99
[5855.72 → 5856.48] Asking
[5856.48 → 5857.26] Badminton Hall
[5857.26 → 5857.90] Update when
[5857.90 → 5859.00] Actually
[5859.00 → 5859.98] Big news
[5859.98 → 5860.60] Oh

[5861.46 → 5862.52] Floors arrived

[5866.44 → 5867.34] On them being in then
[5867.34 → 5868.24] I don't know
[5868.24 → 5868.56] But
[5868.56 → 5870.70] I would like to
[5870.70 → 5871.26] I would like
[5871.26 → 5871.80] Is it March
[5871.80 → 5873.22] I would like to
[5873.22 → 5874.02] Get a shout-out
[5874.02 → 5875.58] Why
[5875.58 → 5876.50] What's happening in March
[5876.50 → 5877.52] I think I've called this
[5877.52 → 5878.66] For like a year and a half
[5878.66 → 5880.00] Dad's been saying
[5880.00 → 5880.54] It's going to be
[5880.54 → 5881.42] March this year
[5881.42 → 5881.98] Bastard
[5881.98 → 5882.72] For like
[5882.72 → 5883.74] At least a year
[5883.74 → 5884.76] At least a year
[5884.76 → 5885.86] I think when we started
[5885.86 → 5887.16] Last year in January
[5887.16 → 5889.70] I would like to call out
[5889.70 → 5890.24] Shout out
[5890.24 → 5891.34] I would like to shout out
[5891.34 → 5893.94] Calibre Sport Systems
[5893.94 → 5896.34] These guys are the installer
[5896.34 → 5897.12] For our floor
[5897.12 → 5899.42] We obviously had the quality issue
[5899.42 → 5900.64] With the initial product
[5900.64 → 5901.30] Yeah
[5901.30 → 5902.82] But I have had
[5902.82 → 5904.52] So many contractors
[5904.52 → 5906.58] Make that my problem
[5906.58 → 5907.16] Over the years
[5907.16 → 5908.74] And these guys
[5908.74 → 5909.72] To their credit
[5909.72 → 5912.02] Have not breathed
[5912.02 → 5912.86] A word
[5912.86 → 5914.40] About any kind of
[5914.40 → 5915.76] Additional labour charge
[5915.76 → 5916.66] In spite of the
[5916.66 → 5918.00] Enormous amount of extra work
[5918.00 → 5918.56] That it's going to be
[5918.56 → 5919.28] To uninstall
[5919.28 → 5920.06] One of their things
[5920.06 → 5921.24] And then reinstall
[5921.24 → 5922.64] Some other product
[5922.64 → 5923.64] That we ordered separately
[5923.64 → 5924.64] They gave me
[5924.64 → 5925.90] A very fair
[5925.90 → 5926.86] Credit
[5926.86 → 5927.70] For the material
[5927.70 → 5928.62] That we weren't using
[5928.62 → 5930.70] And they're not done yet
[5930.70 → 5932.32] But they have acted
[5932.32 → 5933.44] In such good faith
[5933.44 → 5934.62] That I just wanted to
[5934.62 → 5935.28] I just wanted to
[5935.28 → 5935.90] Shout them out
[5935.90 → 5937.38] As one of the first
[5937.38 → 5938.44] Like
[5938.44 → 5938.88] What?
[5939.08 → 5939.34] Positive?
[5939.74 → 5940.82] Contractor companies
[5940.82 → 5942.24] That I have encountered
[5942.24 → 5943.58] Here in the Lower Mainland
[5943.58 → 5944.86] That does not
[5944.86 → 5945.82] Seem to
[5945.82 → 5946.40] F*** around
[5946.40 → 5946.80] So
[5946.80 → 5947.68] Yeah
[5947.68 → 5949.18] Thanks guys
[5949.18 → 5950.58] Shout out
[5950.58 → 5951.46] Appreciate you
[5951.46 → 5953.06] They've been so communicative
[5953.06 → 5953.82] And about
[5953.82 → 5954.86] Like getting on site
[5954.86 → 5955.54] And coordinating
[5955.54 → 5956.32] With the delivery
[5956.32 → 5957.08] Of the new
[5957.08 → 5957.86] Flooring material
[5957.86 → 5958.22] And everything
[5958.22 → 5959.76] So we're really excited
[5959.76 → 5960.40] To be open
[5960.40 → 5960.70] Open
[5960.70 → 5962.54] We launched our
[5962.54 → 5963.00] Memberships
[5963.00 → 5964.40] On the 14th
[5964.40 → 5964.78] So
[5964.78 → 5965.72] Memberships are
[5965.72 → 5966.18] Active
[5966.18 → 5967.16] We have
[5967.16 → 5969.00] I don't know
[5969.00 → 5969.44] If I should
[5969.44 → 5970.76] We have a lot
[5970.76 → 5971.66] Of members
[5971.66 → 5972.22] Immediately
[5972.22 → 5973.46] Which is pretty exciting
[5973.46 → 5974.04] We did a
[5974.04 → 5974.76] Founding membership
[5974.76 → 5976.30] A founding membership
[5976.30 → 5976.66] Deal
[5976.66 → 5977.66] At a discount
[5977.66 → 5978.58] And just to get
[5978.58 → 5979.12] Some momentum
[5979.12 → 5980.34] And I'm very excited
[5980.34 → 5980.76] About it
[5980.76 → 5981.72] It's going to be awesome
[5981.72 → 5983.26] Alright
[5983.26 → 5984.34] Oh hold on
[5984.34 → 5984.66] Hold on
[5984.66 → 5984.96] Hold on
[5984.96 → 5985.54] Hold on
[5985.54 → 5986.60] RIA
[5986.60 → 5987.64] RIA Fell
[5987.64 → 5988.10] Says
[5988.10 → 5988.74] Why is the
[5988.74 → 5989.42] Backpack enamel
[5989.42 → 5989.66] Pin
[5989.66 → 5990.26] $250
[5990.26 → 5992.58] Oh no
[5992.58 → 5993.16] They figured it out
[5993.16 → 5993.80] They figured it out
[5993.80 → 5995.82] Linus
[5995.82 → 5996.82] You should know better
[5996.82 → 5998.16] Comes with the backpack
[5998.16 → 5999.36] Okay
[5999.36 → 6000.90] What are we supposed
[6000.90 → 6001.46] To be doing right now
[6001.46 → 6002.60] You should probably
[6002.60 → 6003.68] Do the rest of your topics
[6003.68 → 6004.60] Oh topics
[6004.60 → 6004.84] Yes
[6004.84 → 6005.24] And then we'll do
[6005.24 → 6005.84] Merch messages
[6005.84 → 6006.08] Okay
[6006.08 → 6008.26] So I have a bamboo
[6008.26 → 6008.80] Labs printer
[6008.80 → 6010.70] Other than mistakes
[6010.70 → 6011.84] That I have made
[6011.84 → 6013.16] That have made it
[6013.16 → 6014.04] Not work as well
[6014.04 → 6015.10] It has been
[6015.10 → 6015.96] Fairly reliable
[6015.96 → 6016.96] So basically
[6016.96 → 6017.58] What I'm trying to say
[6017.58 → 6018.24] Is I've spent a lot
[6018.24 → 6018.90] Of time fixing it
[6018.90 → 6019.72] But it's mostly on me
[6019.72 → 6021.36] I have my setup
[6021.36 → 6023.42] Like locked in right now
[6023.42 → 6024.08] And my kids
[6024.08 → 6025.58] Love it
[6025.58 → 6027.08] Especially my eldest daughter
[6027.08 → 6028.10] She is
[6028.10 → 6029.38] Constantly
[6029.38 → 6031.06] On the bamboo printer
[6031.06 → 6032.46] Her latest thing
[6032.46 → 6033.48] Is printing out things
[6033.48 → 6033.90] To paint
[6033.90 → 6035.50] Oh that's cool
[6035.50 → 6035.86] Yeah
[6035.86 → 6036.96] Super cool
[6036.96 → 6037.48] That's actually
[6037.48 → 6038.46] I don't think
[6038.46 → 6039.50] I've seen a ton of examples
[6039.50 → 6040.42] That's such a good idea
[6040.42 → 6041.40] That makes a ton of sense
[6041.40 → 6041.66] Yeah
[6041.66 → 6042.48] So she'll
[6042.48 → 6043.56] She'll print out things
[6043.56 → 6043.98] And she'll
[6043.98 → 6044.60] So she
[6044.60 → 6045.44] She printed out a bunch
[6045.44 → 6046.16] Of flex cats
[6046.16 → 6047.38] And painted them
[6047.38 → 6048.48] Like all of our cats
[6048.48 → 6049.30] Oh that's
[6049.30 → 6050.00] With Yvonne
[6050.00 → 6050.52] And her sister
[6050.52 → 6051.52] So they all
[6051.52 → 6052.26] Cute as heck
[6052.26 → 6052.74] So they're gonna
[6052.74 → 6053.52] Set some
[6053.52 → 6054.80] Anyway
[6054.80 → 6056.40] I'm losing it
[6056.40 → 6056.98] Anyway
[6056.98 → 6058.86] She's having a blast
[6058.86 → 6059.28] With it
[6059.28 → 6059.80] Oh my god
[6059.80 → 6061.00] Can she paint our birds
[6061.00 → 6062.72] I don't see why not
[6062.72 → 6063.26] Yeah sure
[6063.26 → 6064.02] Oh my god
[6064.02 → 6065.44] Yeah message my son
[6065.44 → 6066.28] You have him on
[6066.28 → 6066.90] On social
[6066.90 → 6067.58] Well not now
[6067.58 → 6068.04] But like
[6068.04 → 6068.80] I just mean whenever
[6068.80 → 6069.30] Just
[6069.30 → 6070.50] My brain is a sieve
[6070.50 → 6071.36] I will forget this
[6071.36 → 6072.32] I'm sending
[6072.32 → 6073.70] I'm sending you
[6073.70 → 6074.96] A scheduled message
[6074.96 → 6076.00] Oh, thanks Dan
[6076.00 → 6077.16] So bamboo
[6077.16 → 6077.66] Dan knows me
[6077.66 → 6079.48] Bamboo
[6079.48 → 6080.76] This is not cool
[6080.76 → 6082.98] I just want to shout out
[6082.98 → 6083.86] Nick Johnson
[6083.86 → 6085.14] In the Bamboo Lab
[6085.14 → 6085.98] Subreddit
[6085.98 → 6088.04] Who put together
[6088.04 → 6088.94] What I think
[6088.94 → 6089.96] Is such
[6089.96 → 6091.56] A succinct
[6091.56 → 6092.72] Thorough
[6092.72 → 6094.18] Respectful
[6094.18 → 6094.84] Post
[6094.84 → 6095.60] About
[6095.60 → 6096.62] What a big deal
[6096.62 → 6097.00] It is
[6097.00 → 6097.88] That Bamboo Labs
[6097.88 → 6098.78] Is removing
[6098.78 → 6099.62] Third party
[6099.62 → 6100.56] Printer access
[6100.56 → 6101.56] If
[6101.56 → 6102.58] What's that
[6102.58 → 6103.06] What does that mean
[6103.06 → 6104.62] Basically what it means
[6104.62 → 6105.28] Is that
[6105.28 → 6106.04] You will not have
[6106.04 → 6106.74] The ability to use
[6106.74 → 6107.28] Third party
[6107.28 → 6108.28] Software such as
[6108.28 → 6109.02] Orca Slicer
[6109.02 → 6109.90] Or Panda Touch
[6109.90 → 6111.28] It will not be able
[6111.28 → 6112.10] To connect directly
[6112.10 → 6112.78] To your printer
[6112.78 → 6113.48] That's icky
[6113.48 → 6114.20] This is
[6114.20 → 6115.28] Well it's icky
[6115.28 → 6116.46] And it's also
[6116.46 → 6117.80] According to
[6117.80 → 6118.60] Bamboo Labs
[6118.60 → 6119.10] To
[6119.10 → 6120.70] Help with
[6120.70 → 6121.58] Authentication
[6121.58 → 6122.34] On the printer
[6122.34 → 6123.12] To avoid
[6123.12 → 6124.18] Any kind of
[6124.18 → 6125.48] Remote access
[6125.48 → 6126.48] By a malicious
[6126.48 → 6127.14] Third party
[6127.14 → 6127.96] To the camera
[6127.96 → 6128.58] For instance
[6128.58 → 6129.18] Or to
[6129.18 → 6130.36] Print to your printer
[6130.36 → 6131.24] This
[6131.24 → 6132.72] Seems like
[6132.72 → 6133.26] They could have
[6133.26 → 6134.04] Implemented it
[6134.04 → 6134.72] Better
[6134.72 → 6135.58] If they weren't
[6135.58 → 6135.96] Rushing
[6135.96 → 6137.04] And in such a way
[6137.04 → 6137.80] That it doesn't
[6137.80 → 6138.34] Break
[6138.34 → 6139.60] This compatibility
[6139.60 → 6141.78] But what
[6141.78 → 6143.28] What Nick Johnson
[6143.28 → 6144.04] Encourages people
[6144.04 → 6144.34] To do
[6144.34 → 6144.88] And this is why
[6144.88 → 6145.62] I like his post
[6145.62 → 6146.10] So much
[6146.10 → 6147.06] Is he doesn't
[6147.06 → 6147.84] Just whine
[6147.84 → 6149.14] I can't believe
[6149.14 → 6149.72] I'm on Reddit
[6149.72 → 6150.10] Right now
[6150.10 → 6151.98] What you can do
[6151.98 → 6152.42] About it
[6152.42 → 6153.68] Don't update
[6153.68 → 6154.22] Your printer's
[6154.22 → 6154.56] Firmware
[6154.56 → 6155.28] They will likely
[6155.28 → 6155.78] Be tracking
[6155.78 → 6156.66] Installation counts
[6156.66 → 6157.48] Make it clear
[6157.48 → 6158.02] You won't run
[6158.02 → 6158.52] This firmware
[6158.52 → 6160.00] Contact Bamboo
[6160.00 → 6160.34] Labs
[6160.34 → 6161.54] Politely express
[6161.54 → 6162.16] Your concerns
[6162.16 → 6162.60] Using their
[6162.60 → 6163.20] Support portal
[6163.20 → 6163.96] And he actually
[6163.96 → 6164.56] Provides some
[6164.56 → 6165.10] Templates
[6165.10 → 6166.38] For you to
[6166.38 → 6167.50] Copy and paste
[6167.50 → 6168.32] What your
[6168.32 → 6169.06] Concerns are
[6169.06 → 6170.32] Vote with your
[6170.32 → 6170.72] Wallet
[6170.72 → 6171.86] Stop buying
[6171.86 → 6172.52] Bamboo Labs
[6172.52 → 6173.14] Consumables
[6173.14 → 6174.02] And consider
[6174.02 → 6174.84] Alternatives
[6174.84 → 6176.06] Until they
[6176.06 → 6177.02] Reverse course
[6177.02 → 6179.42] Withdraw your
[6179.42 → 6179.80] Support on
[6179.80 → 6180.32] Maker World
[6180.32 → 6181.92] And spread the
[6181.92 → 6182.10] Word
[6182.10 → 6183.32] So
[6183.32 → 6184.20] This is so
[6184.20 → 6184.88] Professional
[6184.88 → 6185.32] Yeah
[6185.32 → 6185.98] Does this person
[6185.98 → 6186.36] Work in
[6186.36 → 6186.90] Communication
[6186.90 → 6187.48] I don't know
[6187.48 → 6188.80] But shout out
[6188.80 → 6190.60] And I agree
[6190.60 → 6191.52] I will not be
[6191.52 → 6191.96] Updating my
[6191.96 → 6192.18] Printer
[6192.18 → 6193.14] Because I love
[6193.14 → 6193.90] Having convenient
[6193.90 → 6194.72] Unauthenticated
[6194.72 → 6195.38] Remote access
[6195.38 → 6195.98] And it sits in
[6195.98 → 6196.48] A room where I
[6196.48 → 6197.60] Quite frankly
[6197.60 → 6198.22] Couldn't care less
[6198.22 → 6198.70] If somebody's
[6198.70 → 6199.12] Looking at the
[6199.12 → 6199.80] Camera of what
[6199.80 → 6200.20] I'm printing
[6200.20 → 6202.38] So that's
[6202.38 → 6203.00] That's my
[6203.00 → 6203.74] That's my
[6203.74 → 6204.28] Stance on it
[6204.28 → 6204.84] I don't believe
[6204.84 → 6205.38] They can force
[6205.38 → 6205.78] An update
[6205.78 → 6206.70] I just hope my
[6206.70 → 6207.18] Kids don't
[6207.18 → 6208.30] Accidentally do it
[6208.30 → 6208.78] I'll have to
[6208.78 → 6209.12] I'll have to
[6209.12 → 6209.56] Remind them about
[6209.56 → 6209.92] That's how I
[6209.92 → 6210.28] Ended up with
[6210.28 → 6210.82] Windows 11
[6210.82 → 6211.74] On my VR PC
[6211.74 → 6213.08] And like it
[6213.08 → 6213.56] Broke a bunch
[6213.56 → 6214.28] Of driver stuff
[6214.28 → 6215.68] Kids
[6215.68 → 6216.74] Like thank you
[6216.74 → 6217.14] Microsoft

[6222.78 → 6223.26] That one out there
[6223.26 → 6223.72] That was just a
[6223.72 → 6224.44] Quick random mention
[6224.44 → 6224.94] What else we got
[6224.94 → 6225.28] Today
[6225.28 → 6227.16] Ooh
[6227.16 → 6228.24] Do you want to
[6228.24 → 6228.78] Get into
[6228.78 → 6230.06] Like a main topic
[6230.06 → 6230.64] Oh my goodness
[6230.64 → 6231.06] We have so many
[6231.06 → 6231.82] Topics left Luke
[6231.82 → 6232.22] TikTok
[6232.22 → 6233.00] What are we going
[6233.00 → 6233.36] To do
[6233.36 → 6233.96] TikTok
[6233.96 → 6234.70] Yeah sure
[6234.70 → 6236.68] Goodbye TikTok
[6236.68 → 6238.44] Today January 17th
[6238.44 → 6239.08] The Supreme Court
[6239.08 → 6240.54] Unanimously upheld
[6240.54 → 6241.44] The federal ban
[6241.44 → 6242.18] Of TikTok
[6242.18 → 6243.50] Starting Sunday
[6243.50 → 6244.60] The 19th
[6244.60 → 6246.00] It's coming very soon
[6246.00 → 6246.98] Since it failed
[6246.98 → 6247.62] To be sold
[6247.62 → 6248.20] To an American
[6248.20 → 6248.84] Based company
[6248.84 → 6249.72] The origin
[6249.72 → 6250.36] Of the ban
[6250.36 → 6251.14] Was concerns
[6251.14 → 6251.78] Over security
[6251.78 → 6252.40] Risk due to
[6252.40 → 6253.16] Its ties to
[6253.16 → 6253.70] China
[6253.70 → 6254.32] While
[6254.32 → 6255.34] Sorry
[6255.34 → 6255.96] With White
[6255.96 → 6256.52] House press
[6256.52 → 6257.02] Secretary
[6257.02 → 6259.28] Marine Jean
[6259.28 → 6259.62] Pierre
[6259.62 → 6260.72] Saying
[6260.72 → 6261.08] TikTok
[6261.08 → 6261.96] Should remain
[6261.96 → 6262.80] Available to
[6262.80 → 6263.38] Americans
[6263.38 → 6264.22] But simply
[6264.22 → 6265.06] Under American
[6265.06 → 6265.66] Ownership
[6265.66 → 6266.48] Or other
[6266.48 → 6267.02] Ownership
[6267.02 → 6267.64] That addresses
[6267.64 → 6268.20] The national
[6268.20 → 6269.12] Security concerns
[6269.12 → 6269.88] Identified by
[6269.88 → 6270.58] Congress
[6270.58 → 6271.42] In developing
[6271.42 → 6271.98] This law
[6271.98 → 6273.76] President-elect
[6273.76 → 6274.52] Donald Trump
[6274.52 → 6275.66] Has expressed
[6275.66 → 6276.42] Interest in
[6276.42 → 6277.10] Looking into
[6277.10 → 6277.56] This and
[6277.56 → 6278.48] Possibly reverting
[6278.48 → 6278.86] The ban
[6278.86 → 6279.20] Once he
[6279.20 → 6279.82] Takes office
[6279.82 → 6280.62] The app
[6280.62 → 6281.40] Also will
[6281.40 → 6281.82] Not be
[6281.82 → 6282.22] Deleted
[6282.22 → 6283.12] From phone
[6283.12 → 6284.22] Similar to
[6284.22 → 6284.88] This is a
[6284.88 → 6285.22] Side note
[6285.22 → 6285.56] But similar
[6285.56 → 6286.48] To Flappy Bird
[6286.48 → 6286.92] Back in the
[6286.92 → 6287.12] Day
[6287.12 → 6288.26] Remember if you
[6288.26 → 6288.78] Had a phone
[6288.78 → 6289.06] That had
[6289.06 → 6289.52] Flappy Bird
[6289.52 → 6290.20] It was like
[6290.20 → 6290.58] Worth more
[6290.58 → 6290.92] Money on
[6290.92 → 6291.14] eBay
[6291.14 → 6291.50] Yeah you
[6291.50 → 6291.92] Could sell
[6291.92 → 6292.14] It
[6292.14 → 6292.56] Like an
[6292.56 → 6293.56] Old iPod
[6293.56 → 6293.96] Or whatever
[6293.96 → 6294.40] You could
[6294.40 → 6295.20] Yeah we
[6295.20 → 6296.12] Might literally
[6296.12 → 6296.64] Have that
[6296.64 → 6297.00] Again
[6297.00 → 6298.66] Which is
[6298.66 → 6299.08] Kind of
[6299.08 → 6299.62] Wild
[6299.62 → 6300.16] But we'll
[6300.16 → 6300.38] See
[6300.38 → 6301.00] So yeah
[6301.00 → 6301.20] It won't
[6301.20 → 6301.58] Be deleted
[6301.58 → 6302.08] From phones
[6302.08 → 6302.54] But it
[6302.54 → 6302.82] Will be
[6302.82 → 6303.10] Removed
[6303.10 → 6303.48] From app
[6303.48 → 6304.00] Stores
[6304.00 → 6304.48] Receive
[6304.48 → 6304.86] No more
[6304.86 → 6305.34] Updates
[6305.34 → 6305.74] And the
[6305.74 → 6306.24] US-based
[6306.24 → 6306.60] Servers
[6306.60 → 6307.16] And connections
[6307.16 → 6307.54] Will be
[6307.54 → 6307.86] Oh
[6307.86 → 6308.68] Whoa
[6308.68 → 6311.16] The US-based
[6311.16 → 6311.44] Servers

[6318.96 → 6319.50] Matter
[6319.50 → 6322.00] It's probably
[6322.00 → 6322.88] Fine
[6322.88 → 6324.40] Canadian data
[6324.40 → 6325.02] Server is gonna

[6911.88 → 6912.00] Not
[6912.00 → 6912.16] That
[6912.16 → 6912.32] Big
[6912.32 → 6912.74] That's

[6938.38 → 6939.02] Yeah
[6939.02 → 6939.46] Federal
[6939.46 → 6939.64] Budget
[6939.64 → 6940.04] Funny
[6940.04 → 6940.64] For
[6940.64 → 6941.14] 2022
[6941.14 → 6941.48] Was
[6941.48 → 6942.36] 6.5
[6942.36 → 6942.52] ёл
[6942.52 → 6944.76] So
[6944.76 → 6954.28] Yeah
[6954.28 → 6962.36] told me that they like regularly deal in all kinds of like not legal tender things whoa like
[6962.36 → 6967.60] like yeah you could if you brought in if is you could have the assayed value proven or whatever
[6967.60 → 6973.02] like they'd basically take anything for payment I was like what or was it Porsche or
[6973.02 → 6977.30] was it another brand I don't remember but yeah I did encounter a car dealership once that like
[6977.30 → 6983.88] brought up UN unprompted man that they would take gold for payment I was like are you kidding me so
[6983.88 → 6989.88] I could buy a car with doubloons people are yelling at me about American things I don't know dude i
[6989.88 → 6993.94] don't care we're Canadians someone's like look at the American debt clock I don't even know what that
[6993.94 → 6999.04] is crazy you don't know what the debt clock is oh this thing's crazy hold on the debt clock
[6999.04 → 7004.60] we trust me guys we have so many problems up here real time we're gonna look at ourselves
[7004.60 → 7009.92] for a little while real time Kevin's got some work to do okay here we go this is money gained value
[7009.92 → 7014.26] uh okay I don't know I don't know what can i make this go away I just want to see the debt
[7014.26 → 7020.16] clock it looks like you installed all the browser parts okay whatever the point is here so um you can
[7020.16 → 7025.60] watch the debt per citizen, and you can watch the U.S. national debt go up so that just ticked over a
[7025.60 → 7035.04] million dollars um whoa let's just wait for the rest of this million so we've done half a million dollars
[7035.04 → 7041.02] since I said a million dollars like they that they do have some challenges as well
[7041.02 → 7047.92] they do have some challenges as well there you go there's another million dollars it's wild yeah
[7047.92 → 7054.42] yeah good luck America but at that point what's 56 billion more
[7054.42 → 7059.60] can you imagine the amount of minerals that are under that huge hunk of rock
[7059.60 → 7065.74] uh maybe there's some I don't know I don't know don't say it they'll hear you
[7065.74 → 7072.08] don't say it maybe there's some oil no let's go open up
[7072.08 → 7080.68] you guys do know what he's doing right this is all the distractions so they don't come for Canada
[7080.68 → 7088.18] yeah there's not don't Alberta don't look at Alberta they have no rats that's if it's just mountains
[7088.18 → 7095.36] and uh and then less mountainous areas yeah this is you want to hear uh interesting Canada facts
[7095.36 → 7103.12] uh map of rats in the world is that yeah yeah that's that's the best Canada fact oh dude yeah
[7103.12 → 7105.74] here Luke laptop global rat distribution
[7105.74 → 7114.00] there's just so where it's completely freezing cold there are no rats and then randomly there's just
[7114.00 → 7120.64] this little thing there because for some reason one of our provinces just it doesn't they
[7120.64 → 7126.48] eradicated rats they went hard they went super hard they did the like Australian emu war
[7126.48 → 7134.16] but they did it against rats, and they won yeah they actually eliminated rats from the province of
[7134.16 → 7139.74] Alberta which is hilarious insane so while you guys are cool story it's a cool rabbit hole
[7139.74 → 7144.78] brand American things a rathole sounds like a way worse thing than a rabbit hole yeah have you
[7144.78 → 7151.10] heard of what is it called the rat king no yeah those are sad rat king yeah you don't
[7151.10 → 7157.58] actually want to like show this on screen um a rat king is a collection of mice or rats whose tails
[7157.58 → 7161.22] are intertwined and bound together in some way they get like stuck
[7161.22 → 7166.26] when they're like climbing over each other whatever their tails get tied together and then
[7166.26 → 7170.92] they get stuck, and they can't work out of it, and they like actually horrible they just die yeah
[7170.92 → 7177.06] oh so you end up finding this like are you being such a down bundle of I don't know this is why we
[7177.06 → 7183.56] have to get rid of them yeah okay Alberta cured the world away they led the way yeah Linus media group
[7183.56 → 7189.98] has started posting our internal 3d printing designs oh that's good news that's a good idea yeah let's
[7189.98 → 7194.80] go with that so I asked for this like over a year ago anyway it takes time it takes time for us to
[7194.80 → 7199.22] compile things and have someone take the lead this is not a revenue generating activity so just because
[7199.22 → 7203.80] I ask for it doesn't mean that people are like I will immediately work on this because it's the most
[7203.80 → 7208.44] valuable thing I can do I get it people prioritize, but it is something that I have followed up on
[7208.44 → 7215.98] sometimes because we design all this cool stuff CPU holders screwdriver holders all kinds of stuff
[7215.98 → 7220.80] and uh someone said rat kings are a myth I'm going to decide that is a fact and just move on okay
[7220.80 → 7226.28] cool um so we design all kinds of cool stuff and then we just sit on it, we do nothing with
[7226.28 → 7231.86] it we have no like uh universal repository for it to make even for us internally to make it easier to
[7231.86 → 7236.94] find all of these design files where's the rest of our stuff we're working on it okay so, so anyway
[7236.94 → 7243.98] it's finally there printables.com at Linus tech tips so we've got the uh magnetic cable management
[7243.98 → 7249.54] power bar screwdriver holder so it's got the um basically it's got the little keyhole in the back
[7249.54 → 7253.74] so that you can put our magnetic cable management on it, and you can just attach your screwdriver to
[7253.74 → 7259.98] anything metal yeah which is pretty cool we've got um the desk pad tester I mean yeah sure why
[7259.98 → 7266.24] why not uh our hot air rework station tip rack uh we've got our Sonos connect amp wall mount that
[7266.24 → 7271.84] was a Dan I did that one I'm very proud of that we've got our uh fibre insulation wall mounting
[7271.84 → 7277.30] plates these are super cool these are from uh Jake's video where we acoustically treated the server room
[7277.30 → 7282.76] those are sick it'd be kind of cool for us to include oh yeah so there you see you can see it's uh
[7282.76 → 7287.60] it's driven into the stud behind it, and then it holds the insulation onto the wall, and then we put
[7287.60 → 7291.58] uh Auvergne, and then we have this metal plate here so you just put a ring magnet on it to hold
[7291.58 → 7296.42] the Auvergne or to hold the uh the fabric in place over top of it that was from before we launched uh
[7296.42 → 7302.30] MCM so we just had buckets and buckets of ring magnets oh that makes sense yeah so we have a bunch
[7302.30 → 7306.86] more stuff that we're going to be adding over time people are already remixing them which is super
[7306.86 → 7313.98] exciting for me, I think that's super cool I want us to be I want us to be part of that uh part of that
[7313.98 → 7318.82] culture you know I want us to contribute yeah there's a bunch of lab stuff so we do this too
[7318.82 → 7326.06] that's cool spurge in flow plane chat said there's more there is more um I know of at least a few um
[7326.06 → 7332.18] I have so many yeah because we have the CPU trays the CPU trays they're all individualized we
[7332.18 → 7337.68] have the ram trays we've got all the random garbage I've done oh I bet you they're trying to figure out
[7337.68 → 7342.72] how to do things like the individualized stuff I don't know no, no they're all like you know just
[7342.72 → 7351.24] TLS yeah but like filing them nicely I guess maybe you just like name them naming them yeah
[7351.24 → 7355.60] I don't know dang it I'm I'm just trying to figure out why they wouldn't be up but
[7355.60 → 7363.22] I'm trying to find an effort not fair would you want me spending a few hours uploading no
[7363.22 → 7369.96] there you go it's not you didn't do this right there we go took me a while to find it because
[7369.96 → 7375.32] this may surprise you but the Subreddit is um pretty active right now a little busy yeah they're
[7375.32 → 7381.58] doing stuff check this out are they being cordial somebody already remixed it to go on the IKEA
[7381.58 → 7386.92] wall mount thing oh nice that's awesome a lot of people have those so that's probably good yeah so i
[7386.92 → 7391.54] want to I want to see more of that kind of stuff and like yeah I don't know it's cool it's ever since i
[7391.54 → 7397.78] remember I think I was I think I was sitting in the creator warehouse engineering area um and I was
[7397.78 → 7404.10] looking at someone had created like a really cool holder for I don't even think it was for a finished
[7404.10 → 7408.02] product it was for like keeping track of the parts for an in-progress project and I was like
[7408.02 → 7414.74] we've designed so much cool like 3d printed crap and I know you designed that there's no way that you
[7414.74 → 7418.84] downloaded something that specifically like and they're like oh yeah it doesn't take that long and
[7418.84 → 7423.32] I'm like right, but it takes a long time for people who aren't you so we should release this
[7423.32 → 7426.60] stuff this would be so cool we're finally freaking doing it and I'm really excited about it
[7426.60 → 7432.60] yeah that's sick okay what else are we talking about what do you want to talk about next uh oh it
[7432.60 → 7436.56] says we plan to publish a new model at least once a quarter, so the next one would be sometime in March oh
[7436.56 → 7442.58] we could do them faster than that you guys send it ah well okay I will advocate
[7442.58 → 7447.50] internally for us to hurry our butts up and get more stuff up there okay send it I want the CPU
[7447.50 → 7453.98] holders up there people have asked for them so many times signed it is anyone watching
[7453.98 → 7459.10] from the whoever's working on this no I don't see anyone in chat okay cool Linus's a plus
[7459.10 → 7465.10] certification was ripped right directly out of his hands he was holding on to it, they would no
[7466.70 → 7472.46] deny three months after our video on comp Tia's a plus exam was removed from YouTube and flow plane
[7472.46 → 7481.26] Linus's a plus certification was finally revoked we received an email from Pearson views redly digital
[7481.26 → 7488.22] credential service late last week and confirmed it via comp Tia's verification website we can check for
[7488.22 → 7492.78] ourselves live on the show if you guys would like here we go we'll do now watch it be reinstated it'll be
[7492.78 → 7505.82] genuinely okay fmkv7 uh oh no balls well there's your problem no robot could be this stupid so I'm sure
[7505.82 → 7513.90] this will work this certificate oh no longer valid oh the tonight show is going to be embarrassed
[7514.46 → 7519.98] how bringing on a tech guy a tech person on who doesn't even have who doesn't even have a plus
[7519.98 → 7527.42] certification from non-certified from comp Tia non-certified fail absolute failure that's rough
[7528.14 → 7532.30] well hey we are coming up on the five-year anniversary of the I'm thinking of retiring
[7532.30 → 7537.26] stream so it's over maybe I only needed to think about it for just five years unfortunately it was
[7537.26 → 7540.86] forced and then I'll be ready you know what sorry I'm coming back to the tonight show again because
[7541.58 → 7549.90] i have to say I feel actually kind of invigorated by it, I feel like it's an opportunity
[7549.98 → 7557.66] for us to get for us to share that like real tech yeah yeah with a completely new
[7557.66 → 7564.70] audience and uh I find that really exciting that's cool yeah anyway nice um I'm thinking of doing
[7565.82 → 7570.94] a five-year update stream or five-year update video I've been kind of putting it off I've had a lot on my
[7570.94 → 7579.90] mind lately you don't say yeah um Sammy wanted me to do it as a short I'm like Sammy no dude I'm like
[7579.90 → 7583.90] Sammy how am I supposed to do this as a short he's like don't worry I'll cut it down I'm like Sammy it's
[7583.90 → 7588.06] if I do like how I've been feeling for the last five years you're not going to be able to cut it down to
[7588.06 → 7593.90] three minutes he's like yeah I could do it I'm like Sammy no we're not shooting this today he tried
[7593.90 → 7600.86] to get me to shoot it today right before man show Sammy I love you dude, but he's trying to hit his
[7600.86 → 7608.78] quotas man yeah yeah no, no he dude's a hustler I had to talk to him yes about not uh biting off too
[7608.78 → 7613.90] much sometimes he's a hustler he's a hustler yeah he's a hustler, and he works hard for the float
[7613.90 → 7619.82] plane community he really do I think he genuinely like cares about the floaters a lot I see him in the
[7619.82 → 7624.86] comments all the time yep no, no love Sammy there was i was looking through the comments
[7624.86 → 7630.62] on one of my show tour videos which I had actually a lot of fun filming oh yeah that's uh these
[7630.62 → 7635.66] are these are hilarious dude you watched it I was watching I was I watched this is probably my
[7635.66 → 7641.90] when i left off i someone sent me this Sammy just bashing that robot was so funny
[7643.66 → 7647.58] okay that was a good one wait for it yeah that's the one that you did wait for it wait for it
[7649.82 → 7661.26] boom did he even touch the ball I don't think so what's this robot worth I think it's 100 grand
[7661.98 → 7667.50] he just beat it uh but yeah in that video I was going through the comments and I saw this like
[7667.50 → 7672.22] disparaging comment about Sammy so I was about to respond to it to be like hey like what the heck
[7672.22 → 7678.14] and then I realized it was Sammy I was like okay all right whatever yeah he's got a very uh he's got a
[7678.14 → 7684.94] very self um self-deprecating yeah self-deprecating sense of humour yeah okay so my a-plus certification
[7684.94 → 7690.38] has been revoked this is cool man I love it when this kind of thing happens what is this um also
[7690.38 → 7696.14] also spotted on the Subreddit oh I didn't have this seems like the kind of thing Dan would have heard of
[7696.14 → 7705.50] Dan do you know adient oh my goodness I'm on the wrong audio output it sounded cool though yeah that
[7705.50 → 7711.58] definitely got my attention so they did a promotional video for a new audio interface with a lot of
[7711.58 → 7718.70] inputs and a lot of outputs yeahs are they still relevant I don't know they're relevant to me check
[7718.70 → 7728.70] this out wait for it wait for it all this in one u rack space whoa what's that yo
[7731.82 → 7738.22] let's go because you know that these guys are not a big enough company that they like
[7738.22 → 7743.82] went and sourced a LTT backpack to specifically feature it probably just like the guys there one
[7743.82 → 7748.78] of them just has the Ltd bag and was like I have a backpack that it will fit in I got this cool like
[7748.78 → 7753.50] backpack that fits all the tech stuff why don't we put it ah I love it very cool I think I have a
[7753.50 → 7759.50] bunch of their vintage gear very cool so i I don't know much about their products or anything I don't
[7759.50 → 7766.62] I don't do that world very much but definitely appreciated uh Mr rubberducky99 for spotting that in
[7766.62 → 7773.18] their id48 audio interface promotional video I used to use their uh microphone preamps they make some
[7773.18 → 7778.78] amazing stuff so you could you could spot the extra riveted top handle as well as of course the
[7778.78 → 7784.22] orange internals yeah very cool uh should we do the review embargoes bad thing first we should do
[7784.22 → 7789.66] discussion question how does it feel to see CW slash LTT products just popping up in unexpected places
[7789.66 → 7794.94] it's so cool I love it and I usually end up seeing the screwdriver I don't know the backpack is also cool i
[7794.94 → 7800.94] don't know why it surprises me that much like we've sold literally I mean this in a literal sense
[7800.94 → 7806.86] hundreds of thousands of screwdrivers at this point like they are out there we have sold tens of
[7806.86 → 7812.62] thousands of backpacks at this point they're out there, but it still tickles me because I'm just like
[7813.50 → 7820.86] no way you know like that's cool yeah it's cool I watch a bunch of like uh DIY content and stuff
[7820.86 → 7827.58] on YouTube um I mentioned earlier I don't watch TV I do watch a heck on youtube for sure um and every
[7827.58 → 7833.50] once in a while you know they'll pull one out and I'll just be like oh, and you can tell like it's worn
[7834.22 → 7838.46] yeah it's like nice that's what I like to see yeah yeah it's like all right you've actually used
[7838.46 → 7846.22] this a bunch yeah that's because you got it, and you're just like damn damn damn he's nice I love it
[7846.22 → 7852.14] uh you're you Sarah buffalo says does it make you feel like a real company yeah in a big way because
[7852.86 → 7857.18] between like doing the sponsorships and stuff like that where we've actually like sponsored
[7857.18 → 7862.94] creators between seeing people just in the real world just freaking using it one of my favourite
[7862.94 → 7873.74] posts that I see is I am an x technician here's my driver with x thing that I work that I'm working on
[7873.74 → 7880.14] right now in the background, and we see people posting planes and boats and all manner of
[7880.14 → 7890.70] machinery, and it's its super cool it's super cool what uh emperor McMahon said more screwdrivers
[7890.70 → 7896.22] than people in Greenland oh by a long shot we might have sold about as many backpacks as people in
[7896.22 → 7901.18] Greenland so we could have we could have equipped the entire country of Greenland but no not quite oh yeah
[7901.18 → 7904.78] yeah yeah if we count the commuter bag I think we've sold enough backpacks to equip
[7904.78 → 7909.02] everyone in Greenland nice we're not going to do that because I'm not the American government and i
[7909.02 → 7913.98] can't just print money but well I guess well Canadian government I guess I could and does
[7915.98 → 7923.90] nice our printer works very well as well both countries have fantastic printers it's not worth as
[7923.90 → 7928.06] much, so all things considered we have to overclock our printer by about oh yeah 44
[7928.06 → 7931.50] percent extremely high performance in order to get the same output
[7934.30 → 7944.86] very cool um our review embargoes bad okay so I saw I've or rather not I saw but I have observed a
[7944.86 → 7952.30] trend a trend that seems to be picking up steam and I noticed a lot in our coverage at CES this year
[7952.30 → 7959.98] of people feeling like and expressing their feeling that review embargoes or basically
[7960.70 → 7969.58] literally anything other than all the information all at once is like unethical like it's its
[7969.58 → 7978.30] scummy it's its awful, and so I guess what i want to talk about is why information embargoes
[7978.30 → 7983.82] do exist and the pros and cons for all the various parties involved there are definitely
[7983.82 → 7990.62] cons and I think they are sometimes abused by companies um so it depends on i as we go through
[7990.62 → 7996.14] this one of the nuances to keep in mind is how they're used absolutely the idea of one embargo for
[7996.14 → 8001.34] one product is not always how it goes it actually depends on what company it is sometimes that's
[8001.34 → 8008.30] very far from the reality yeah we've had uh we've called out NVIDIA in the past for taking one GPU
[8008.30 → 8012.86] and saying okay here's the embargo for the announcement it exists here's the embargo and
[8012.86 → 8017.98] okay I'm exaggerating a little bit okay I'm going to add some extras but multiple embargoes for one
[8017.98 → 8021.66] product so I'm not going to say NVIDIA anymore I'm just going to say we have had companies
[8023.50 → 8029.34] hit us with variations of Dan are we okay yeah sorry just taking a screen cap hit us with variations of
[8029.90 → 8036.86] here's the embargo for that it exists at all here's the embargo for the basic specs here's the embargo
[8036.86 → 8044.70] for some new technology that it supports or a deeper dive here's the embargo for the unboxing here's
[8044.70 → 8051.74] the embargo for performance analysis it's like okay that's clearly because you're trying to milk content
[8051.74 → 8060.30] you yes you're trying to extend the news cycle as long as possible essentially asking the media to
[8060.30 → 8066.86] do free advertising for you because a lot of that stuff is not really asking them to do any like
[8067.74 → 8072.46] input anything they're just repeating what you've told them because that's the only information they
[8072.46 → 8079.02] have however that doesn't always mean that that's a bad thing a lot of the time what happens with a
[8079.02 → 8088.70] show like CES because it happens on these days is that companies aren't fully ready yet this may
[8088.70 → 8094.78] surprise you, but companies are made up of people who like you stayed up late playing video games
[8094.78 → 8102.06] sometimes and missed a deadline sometimes or ran into a challenging problem sometimes, and you know what
[8102.06 → 8109.10] the one that they have at CES on those days might be held together by wood screws and duct tape and it
[8109.10 → 8117.18] might not be ready to be benchmarked like honestly i I was kind of i was kind of taken aback when NVIDIA
[8117.18 → 8125.66] allowed us to game on the 5090 at all yeah under any circumstances when AMD allowed us to game on the
[8125.66 → 8133.74] dozen AI max plus at all the fact that AMD let me pick the game yeah that was pretty wild i was
[8133.74 → 8138.70] blown away that's not normal none of that is normal that was pretty that was pretty
[8138.70 → 8143.90] cool of them to take usually you can't even like open the settings screen let alone change settings
[8143.90 → 8150.94] let alone change the game etc to take this pre-release not not not fully you know ready for consumer
[8150.94 → 8157.82] prime time stuff and let us show it early um demonstrates a lot of confidence and actually
[8157.82 → 8165.34] a relatively high degree of openness and then to kind of see this uh I don't know this sentiment
[8165.34 → 8170.38] that was pervasive in the comments that they were scummy for not letting us do more it's not a
[8170.38 → 8175.02] performance review and even if they did let me do everything that I could possibly want to I don't
[8175.02 → 8180.86] have time yeah like I've got I've got maybe an hour especially to have proper rigour well yeah exactly
[8181.66 → 8188.22] so I don't know, and realistically they gave us enough they gave us enough that we were able to
[8188.78 → 8194.06] give you guys something you know especially the dozen AI max the fact that we could play that game at
[8194.06 → 8199.34] all and like don't go conspiracy theory guys I saw people being like yeah that scene they picked
[8199.34 → 8204.46] that scene because it's relatively light no I picked that scene because I haven't actually played black
[8204.46 → 8210.30] myth Kong yet and I just bought it I bought it in AMD's booth and that's the beginning of the game
[8210.86 → 8215.58] that's why I ran that scene and the reason that we picked black mouth Kong was because it's a
[8215.58 → 8220.86] really demanding game and I wanted to see can this thing do console level graphics in a in a thin
[8220.86 → 8229.10] like tablet-like device and that happened to be the game that MSI in the next booth over had on a drive
[8229.10 → 8237.66] guys sometimes it ain't that deep yeah and so yeah I thought that was I thought that was really
[8237.66 → 8244.06] cool I think it's a really exciting chip genuinely pretty awesome um anyway so we've got a kind of
[8244.06 → 8248.38] summary from the writing team that they put together and of the kind of the pros and cons so
[8248.38 → 8255.02] pros from a brand perspective you have time to communicate your message and your product details
[8255.02 → 8260.54] to reviewers because if you don't have because otherwise think about it, you can't brief everybody
[8260.54 → 8265.58] at once on a new product you could do a Zoom call, but people are going to have questions they'll
[8265.58 → 8272.38] have follow-ups you need time to disseminate information so having a gap between when you
[8272.38 → 8278.94] first start doing that and when everyone can go public with it buys you time the brand also has time
[8278.94 → 8284.94] to address potential issues before public release of the information and even potentially public
[8284.94 → 8290.86] release of the product we have seen problems that have been found by reviewers that have been fixed
[8290.86 → 8297.66] by the time the product hits the public now should brands be using reviewers as beta testers no
[8298.22 → 8304.46] probably not and does that create a huge amount of extra burden in some cases because you have to redo
[8304.46 → 8311.02] all your testing once they patch it yeah and that's not cool and that's not fair but is that way better
[8311.02 → 8319.10] than a buggy product hitting consumers absolutely of course cons you can lose buzz around the launch if
[8319.66 → 8327.10] reviews are delayed especially if the details leak early I think there are exceptions to this I don't think
[8327.10 → 8332.62] Nintendo has lost any switch to buzz because of all the leaks if anything dude did you see the views on that
[8332.62 → 8338.06] video that's one thing I don't think we actually talked about number one trending yeah i I checked
[8338.06 → 8345.10] the views on the steam deck yeah, and it beat the views on the steam deck in two hours yeah yeah
[8345.10 → 8350.46] all time steam all Nintendo would have to do to be the top YouTuber in the world is release new console
[8350.46 → 8358.70] every day yeah it's already at 16 million views yeah that's wild interesting um okay so another con
[8358.70 → 8364.14] it could be seen as an attempt to control the narrative or limit transparency and in some cases
[8364.14 → 8373.50] we have seen that for reviewers a pro is that it gives all the reviewers a shared deadline and takes away
[8373.50 → 8384.86] some of the sort of feeling that you can have that you like need to rush in order to in order to like
[8384.86 → 8391.50] support yourself in your livelihood, and you know hit the content earlier because there is a strong
[8392.14 → 8397.58] financial not to mention just like dopamine incentive to publishing something that gets a lot of views
[8397.58 → 8402.30] you might still have that's very human a very considerable amount of pressure absolutely
[8403.66 → 8409.58] because maybe the deadline versus when you get the thing oh sure are not really that far away from each
[8409.58 → 8415.58] so i am i am going through this list as like a sort of in good faith if everything's working
[8415.58 → 8422.78] properly manner if that makes sense if everyone has a shared deadline and some people get two weeks
[8422.78 → 8426.06] with it and some people get three days well you kind of still have the same problem don't you
[8427.18 → 8432.62] but if uh is a real good faith effort is made to get everyone the product at the same time
[8432.62 → 8436.54] get everyone the briefing at the same time and then have everybody release the information at the same
[8436.54 → 8441.10] time so that we get these multiple perspectives, but people have time to do their work that can be a
[8441.10 → 8448.86] benefit another pro is that it can give reviewers the ability to plan and allocate resources to cover
[8448.86 → 8456.70] multiple products during times like around CES around computer TikToker there can be a lot of launches
[8456.70 → 8462.62] and if we have embargo dates communicated to us ahead of time it allows us to plan our production
[8462.62 → 8468.94] for instance we made the call to not do a full review of the arc b570 we knew it was going to be
[8468.94 → 8476.06] arc b580 but like slower and cheaper I thought the live stream was a really cool idea yeah the live
[8476.06 → 8480.62] stream was cool, but we didn't actually use the b570 in the live stream oh yeah we used the b580 because
[8481.42 → 8486.86] because we basically what we built was a strategy to address the two major questions that we had
[8486.86 → 8493.42] outstanding how much of a how much of um the opposite of uplift downfall not downfall but
[8493.42 → 8499.18] anyway how much uh how much performance loss was there compared to the b580, and we were able to do
[8499.18 → 8505.66] that with a little bit of light labs testing in a short circuit, so there's the b570 kind of what we
[8505.66 → 8509.90] we said what we need to say about it the other major thing that we've wanted to look at for arc is how's
[8509.90 → 8514.38] the game compatibility on battle mage and then that's where the stream came in where we let viewers
[8514.38 → 8519.10] submit their suggestions for games that we could try side by side against a RTX 4060.
[8519.74 → 8527.74] um another but cons for reviewers brands can seriously hamper the review process like Luke said
[8527.74 → 8534.06] by delaying access to the product it restricts our ability sometimes to cover products in a timely manner
[8534.06 → 8539.90] um like if we uh okay I'm actually I don't know if it restricts our ability to cover things in
[8539.90 → 8544.06] there can be pressure to have your review published the moment the embargo lifts because otherwise
[8544.70 → 8553.10] no one's going to watch it or read it, and it's in a way forcing you to kind of play the game
[8553.10 → 8558.78] right to work with companies and agree to these embargoes to get early access to the products to
[8559.42 → 8564.78] support yourself to have your livelihood right like it puts you it puts you at company's mercy a
[8564.78 → 8572.38] little bit but the reality of it is that's just how it works you can just source products yourself
[8572.38 → 8578.78] we do it for apple for instance apple has zero working relationship with us and we I think we
[8578.78 → 8586.78] still manage to cover their products um, but it is definitely it is definitely beneficial to have a
[8586.78 → 8592.38] product explained by the people who built it um not just beneficial for us but beneficial for the
[8592.38 → 8597.34] viewer so let's get into the benefits for the viewer you get more comprehensive well-researched
[8597.34 → 8602.70] reviews that include multiple perspectives our personal perspective we can get perspectives from
[8602.70 → 8606.78] you know outsiders we can get perspectives from the brand and build the most complete picture that
[8606.78 → 8613.10] we can, it also helps build trust in the review process because if everything's just kind of coming out in
[8613.10 → 8618.78] leaks and dribbles and drabs and people are rushing things because there's you know no time
[8618.78 → 8623.34] and they're just trying to get things up as quick as possible I think that can erode trust but the con
[8623.34 → 8628.38] is consumers may perceive cooperation with embargoes as the reviewer being influenced by the brand I think
[8628.38 → 8636.54] that basically just comes down to how influenced you are by it and in some cases I think some people are
[8636.54 → 8641.42] I think some people are very not influenced by it there are a lot of publications that if they know
[8641.42 → 8646.86] got a briefing on a product, and they got shipped to GPU I'd be like yeah and like what is someone
[8646.86 → 8652.30] gonna is someone going to say that hardware unbox is going to like give better coverage to a GPU
[8652.30 → 8656.22] because or Wendell from level one text is going to give better coverage to a GPU because NVIDIA
[8656.22 → 8662.38] sent it to him please if Wendell was for sale for the price of a GPU I'd be the first one in line to buy
[8662.38 → 8667.10] them you'd have to yeah I don't know about that I'll get that pretty quick
[8671.34 → 8678.30] all right what else we got today what do you want to do Luke uh we can do the john deer thing yeah i
[8678.30 → 8682.54] think we can kind of get just go through that one pretty quick fire it through the U.S. federal trade
[8682.54 → 8688.22] commission along with the attorneys general of Illinois and Minnesota sued tractor and agricultural
[8688.22 → 8694.62] manufacturer john deer on Wednesday alleging that deer has monopoly power over the repair mark oh let's
[8694.62 → 8702.06] go okay right FTC chair and extremely based person Lena khan stated that deer has in quotes has
[8702.06 → 8707.82] allegedly restricted the ability of farmers and independent technicians to repair deer equipment
[8707.82 → 8714.38] including tractors and combines john deer has responded saying that the suit in quotes ignores the
[8714.38 → 8721.34] company's long-standing commitment to customer self-repair and the sure and the consistent
[8721.34 → 8727.42] progress and innovation we have made over time end quote 404 media's article notes that deer has
[8727.42 → 8733.58] become notorious for uh cornering the repair market on its machines by introducing software locks to
[8733.58 → 8737.50] prevent farmers from fixing the equipment that they buy without the authorization of john deer
[8738.78 → 8744.22] being forced to this is no longer the quote but being forced to wait for authorized repair personnel can
[8744.22 → 8749.26] mean significant delays in repairing machines during the critical planting and harvesting seasons
[8749.26 → 8756.62] which can result in lost harvest and dying crops in October 2024 U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren said that
[8756.62 → 8762.94] deer was not honouring a memorandum of understanding that would have made it possible for farmers to make some
[8762.94 → 8770.78] repairs on their own the current FTC suit states that the you was designed to kill right to repair legislation
[8770.78 → 8779.90] and repair regulation against the company I saw some dudes wearing john deer hats down at CES that I was
[8779.90 → 8786.54] relatively certain were just like employees of john deer and it is took a significant amount not to
[8786.54 → 8790.94] just roast them about right to repair I'm not even kidding I don't even know this was happening it's just
[8790.94 → 8798.86] john deer has been the only like agricultural company that has consistently showed up on wan show for just
[8798.86 → 8807.10] being trash uh I'm sure they're like products are good but the right to repair issues are brutal
[8807.10 → 8814.14] and farmers of honestly anyone have been known for maintaining and keeping things going on their own
[8814.14 → 8820.54] historically forever and taking that away from them is ridiculous and stupid and drives up the price of
[8820.54 → 8828.06] food yeah which is like you should all be mad not good yeah DEFCON had a talk about john deer yeah
[8828.06 → 8834.22] and it was sick based Lena khan basically please run for prime minister of Canada yeah come up here
[8834.22 → 8839.02] please it'd be great can do someone know her okay like how many people how many people watching right
[8839.02 → 8843.42] now we got 23 000 people watching on YouTube we probably got a few thousand more on flow plane
[8843.42 → 8849.98] like 25 people on Facebook okay the six degrees of separation thing okay does anyone know anyone who
[8849.98 → 8855.98] knows anyone who knows Lena khan can you just can you just formally can you just formally request that
[8855.98 → 8861.66] she comes to Canada and run for prime minister i will personally be her biggest cheerleader I don't
[8861.66 → 8866.38] think she's announced what she's doing next I'm like genuinely interested hopefully whatever it is
[8866.38 → 8875.18] she's able to have a similar impact um I don't know yeah yeah anyway clear i I am kidding i actually
[8875.18 → 8880.14] can you can uh if you weren't born in Canada can you be prime minister I have no idea I know in
[8880.14 → 8886.38] America you have to be born in do you have to be born that argument constantly comes up in American
[8886.38 → 8890.94] politics I've never heard it for Canadian no four of Canada's prime ministers have been born outside Canada
[8891.66 → 8896.30] oh well okay some of them like the very early ones Alexander McKenzie john a McDonald because like
[8896.38 → 8901.42] i kind of need to be you know everyone's literally every white dude here's our new prime minister
[8901.42 → 8911.74] they're five they'll grow up all right hey can't be much worse there's a little rapid fire hex OS update
[8912.86 → 8919.26] oh okay uh this is from uh this is from john from hex OS we have been absolutely blown away by the
[8919.26 → 8924.22] response from both the LTT and the home server community the sheer number of people who have reached
[8924.22 → 8931.02] out to offer support apply for jobs um offer out potential for partnerships has been incredible
[8931.02 → 8936.46] special thanks to Mawson Dylan Aberdeen Möbius and Theo from the hex OS forums these guys have been
[8936.46 → 8941.50] amazing and helping our community immensely um just to catch you guys up hex OS is the NAS
[8941.50 → 8947.66] software that is um being developed under the leadership of a couple former unpaid guys who
[8947.66 → 8952.86] go way back to helping me with seven gamers one CPU that basically split off, and we're like
[8953.50 → 8963.10] i just um we need startup funding and I was like oh my god you guys um okay uh sure, and you know i I've
[8963.10 → 8968.86] talked about this on the wan show before I had no idea if they're they were going to succeed really I knew
[8968.86 → 8973.66] they're like good guys I knew they're perfect guys, but this is a big project it's a big undertaking
[8973.66 → 8979.66] but what I knew was that I wanted their product to exist an easier DIY NAS software it's built on
[8979.66 → 8984.86] trunks, and it's got a gorgeous interface, and it's designed to be trunks rock solid in the
[8984.86 → 8990.86] foundation and pretty modern like pretty and modern not somewhat modern pretty and modern in the front
[8990.86 → 9002.54] end um anyway fast facts they've sold approximately 28 000 licenses so far so suck it haters basically the
[9002.54 → 9008.38] number of people that are like there's no, no what are they guys just because it's not for you
[9008.38 → 9012.54] doesn't mean it's not for anybody yeah I was just going to say and it not being for you is totally is
[9012.54 → 9018.46] fine totally fine don't use it go roll like baron trunks and like get in there in the command line do it
[9019.02 → 9023.66] do it there's some people I talked to excitedly about this there are other people that I would have
[9023.66 → 9028.54] never brought it up once yeah because it's just not applicable to them at all that's fine
[9028.54 → 9032.70] ESTAC has more than doubled the team size since the launch with at least three more hires planned
[9032.70 → 9039.58] in 2025 and oh I wish I could tell you what this is, but they have already reinvested in the community
[9039.58 → 9045.42] with a six-figure sponsorship of an open source development project to be announced soon it's
[9045.42 → 9050.54] really cool game changer all right um the sheer volume I can, I ask you this is it gonna work with
[9050.54 → 9057.26] their thing cool yeah of course nice, but it'll be open source nice which is cool nice the sheer volume of
[9057.26 → 9061.50] support has made us rethink our development approach for 2025 more info soon once we have
[9061.50 → 9065.02] the new team ramped up I should have time to post some comprehensive updates through blog posts
[9065.02 → 9070.70] exciting times all right so that's it I don't want to spend too much time on this is it oh it's uh after
[9070.70 → 9071.98] dark let's go
[9080.06 → 9085.58] man I told you I've been I shifted some of my weightlifting days to movement and flexibility days yeah
[9085.58 → 9093.26] in general I feel very good there are things that are sore and I'm not used to being sore
[9094.70 → 9101.98] like your perineum oh like that come on that's always sore come on yeah
[9101.98 → 9106.54] if you don't know what it is don't look it up it's fine
[9108.70 → 9114.70] my goodness i did it's my show episode come on if these people sat through two and a half hours
[9114.70 → 9120.22] of the show already they're chill they're easy so i I got a course yeah for the weightlifting stuff i
[9120.22 → 9124.14] didn't do courses I just learned stuff on my own yeah for the flexibility stuff I'm like this is so far
[9124.14 → 9129.66] out of my realm I need somebody to help me so I got I bought a course um it was an unlimited lifetime
[9129.66 → 9134.94] access to this one course whatever they had a Black Friday sale fine I just started it and I started
[9134.94 → 9139.10] watching video I went to the gym and then started watching because it was like okay do this movement
[9139.10 → 9144.06] here's a video so you can see what the movement is and then log your stuff and move on to the next one
[9144.06 → 9149.58] and they had me I'm not a public gym they had me do cat cows do you know what cat cows are
[9149.58 → 9156.46] did you just laugh do you know what they are I snorted yeah do you want to demonstrate no
[9157.10 → 9164.30] no I really don't know no, no no, no there's no shot I'd have to get up on the table that's not happening
[9164.30 → 9167.74] it's not happening it's not happening it's not happening it's not happening I'm gonna hold on
[9167.74 → 9173.82] it's not happening I'm just gonna it's not happening I'm just going to add a picture to the oh no, no no you
[9173.82 → 9179.10] guys you guys can just show it on your laptops of course sure uh cat cow
[9179.58 → 9182.94] so I had to i had to do this in a public gym
[9185.26 → 9189.10] I had to do this in a public gym dude so you go so you start
[9189.10 → 9193.26] the one on the right no we know we're going to get you start the one on the right, and then you go to a
[9193.26 → 9197.82] neutral position then you go to the one on the left and i just I had a certain point I just closed my
[9197.82 → 9202.86] eyes so I was like I don't want to see people looking at me while I do this I went into the corner
[9203.66 → 9207.90] usually I like I'm there I'm working hard I'm lifting pretty heavy this is the gym I normally go to i
[9207.90 → 9213.10] know people there at this point and then out of nowhere new year happens I go into the corner of
[9213.10 → 9221.42] the gym and i just it's like that that great song by two live crew Luke I think it's okay I don't
[9221.42 → 9225.82] think it's I don't think it's embarrassing dude it was very embarrassing
[9228.14 → 9234.46] it was extremely hell yeah get it girl you got this Braun says I call it cat heaving
[9238.78 → 9244.38] does it make it better or worse CNG supernova so that's what white people twerking is
[9244.38 → 9252.94] it's like slow and clunky uh it sounds like Luke's trying to get Linus's thighs but I can't do it
[9254.46 → 9260.30] but I mean yeah like things feel pretty good um good but my goodness i might uh
[9261.10 → 9265.82] I might do those at home we'll see yeah I think that don't let the birds see you they
[9265.82 → 9271.58] won't respect you anymore that whole they said you need a bench but like I don't know I could just use a
[9271.58 → 9278.94] chair for everything I had to do so I can easily do it at home yeah um or couch you know certain
[9282.78 → 9285.58] all right good enough bed frame yeah yeah yeah
[9287.34 → 9291.26] what are we supposed to be doing right now after dark you want a merch message it's very after dark
[9291.26 → 9297.50] this evening yeah sure yeah, yeah sure hit me Dan hey LLD last week you mentioned we're moving away from
[9297.50 → 9301.98] oh no we did that one I didn't archive it what advice do you have for someone moving who wants to
[9301.98 → 9307.34] put in wired networking from scratch currently researching the best setups for access points
[9307.34 → 9313.66] cameras door access land parties etc consider the future and put in conduit yeah but not everywhere
[9313.66 → 9327.02] though like not okay if the run is easy put in one if the run is hard run two you never know you might
[9327.50 → 9333.66] you might pull a Linus and get your like your mirror image screwed up and mis terminate the same
[9333.66 → 9339.90] thing six times and use it all up I did it once Yvonne had to be hard to look at me and go that's not
[9339.90 → 9343.02] what you were doing before I had done all the other ones in the entire installation this was back in my
[9343.02 → 9349.18] old house um you could uh you could have uh you could have something chew through the cable you could
[9349.18 → 9354.54] have things happen basically is what I'm trying to say the cable could just be defective in the first
[9354.54 → 9359.90] place, or it could get damaged while you're running it so if you run two cable is not that it's not
[9359.90 → 9366.38] that expensive in the grand scheme of things running cable can get real expensive depending on where
[9366.38 → 9372.54] you're going so that's a big one for me, I would say for something like access points um now that
[9372.54 → 9377.98] they're all so pretty, and you can do like wireless backhaul with six gigahertz and stuff i I feel like
[9379.58 → 9383.66] I would go wired backhaul for everything but I feel like it's its less of a big deal if you like
[9383.66 → 9390.38] miss a spot but with cameras really get in there with like one camera and just like a hundred meter
[9390.38 → 9395.74] spool and like really make sure you like the views where you're putting in your cameras uh do that
[9395.74 → 9399.82] homework because there's a couple that I'm not really happy with and that I wish I had done a
[9399.82 → 9404.62] little bit differently what about wireless cameras I mean then you still have to deal with power right so
[9404.62 → 9410.94] wireless cameras I've just found them I found them slower I found the quality can be not as good i
[9410.94 → 9419.26] i I don't like anything wireless I always prefer I always prefer wired and see it's also easier to
[9419.26 → 9426.46] run um let me do that it's also easier to run like cat 5 than it is power right this is true
[9427.18 → 9433.82] this is true so yeah i do wire when I can and wireless when I have to for something like a doorbell
[9433.82 → 9439.50] camera you know I'll go yeah sure I'll go wireless if I need to get that like that's fine um what else
[9439.50 → 9443.90] would you what else would you consider currently researching the best apps for access points I mean
[9443.90 → 9450.46] just thoughtfulness is the biggest one door access okay I got a cool video coming on that soon yeah
[9450.46 → 9456.06] spend time testing your access point locations before you actually like permanently place them a
[9456.06 → 9462.78] lot of good can be had with tape to the ceiling yeah, yeah along the wall just to make sure land parties
[9462.78 → 9469.26] I would say for a land party almost I wouldn't even like overthink it as long as you've got one you
[9469.26 → 9475.42] know cat 6a yeah just toss a switch on the table yeah you got one 10 gig uplink yeah you know like
[9475.42 → 9480.46] if you're is you're like that that couple that built the like land game oh yeah yeah dude you know
[9481.18 → 9485.98] that's sick do it up right you're probably not doing that, but that's sick but if you're just trying to be
[9485.98 → 9491.66] ready to run a land party once in a while then yeah as long as you just have like run cat 6a to the
[9491.66 → 9497.58] ones that matter um unlike me do not run cat 6a everywhere if something's only ever going to need
[9497.58 → 9502.14] gigabit or two and a half gig you can do two and a half gig on cat 5e over I don't think over the full
[9502.14 → 9510.14] distance yo Dan do you remember how far uh you can do 2.5 gig on cat 5e I mean the spec is like 300
[9510.14 → 9520.38] feet I'm looking it up now oh is that is the spec 300 feet for 2.5 gig uh come on I think it's like for
[9520.38 → 9529.02] everything uh your mileage yeah your mileage may vary yes because the spec like we've done 10 gig
[9529.02 → 9535.58] in the lap and the spec fails like our testing equipment fails at 300 feet we can still get you
[9535.58 → 9543.82] know 10 gig right yep and like you can run 10 gigs on cat 5e which it's not rated for if the distance
[9543.82 → 9551.10] is extremely short just like you can use like an ancient HDMI 1.4 cable certified cable if it's a
[9551.10 → 9555.34] really short one, and you can run HDMI 2.1 or whatever sometimes it's just it's just
[9555.34 → 9561.42] not a guarantee that's why these standards exist for reliability and consistency as long as you have
[9561.42 → 9567.66] the eight conductors yes yeah that um yeah what else could we really say I'd say um
[9567.66 → 9574.22] I'm moving who wants to put them right now pick your battles that's another big one like if you
[9574.22 → 9579.74] don't have to pull off sheetrock just don't just run a little thing i I thought I cared a lot
[9579.74 → 9584.62] about that when we moved into my current place, and so we like we pulled off drywall everywhere and put
[9584.62 → 9590.14] everything you know behind the drywall and then when we did the one place we didn't was in the family
[9590.14 → 9598.54] room where we have 5.1 or no what even is it 5.5.1.2 I forget what it is but like a surround setup
[9598.54 → 9603.18] because I never intended to have one there and then my bloody family like never wanted to go down
[9603.18 → 9606.70] to the theatre room they always wanted to just watch them like okay fine screw it then we're going to put
[9606.70 → 9610.46] surround in here, and so I had to do it after the fact and I ended up using the little like cable
[9610.46 → 9616.78] hiders and stuff, and you know what I never noticed them yeah I never think about them yeah so pick your
[9616.78 → 9622.14] battles like sometimes it's better to just run a little plastic thing they're so overpriced oh yeah
[9622.14 → 9630.46] it kills me giving Legrand that much money for a little plastic tube I'm dead oh cable hiders hold
[9630.46 → 9636.54] on there's 3d print like a trillion smaller ones yeah and I'm sure there's like cheaper ones um
[9637.82 → 9643.82] but the last time I shopped for these was years ago, and it was not immediately apparent you know what
[9643.82 → 9648.14] the cheaper ones were and if they were any good in fact I think we used some of the cheaper ones
[9648.14 → 9651.98] when we did the family room I think Jake sourced them, but these are the ones that I used years
[9651.98 → 9654.70] before that and I had some leftovers so I used them for some stuff as well
[9656.94 → 9661.34] wire mould cord cover there you go wall hider there are lots of different names for them apparently
[9662.14 → 9668.30] all right what else we got Dan hello Linus Jake and Dunn I'm an ups driver and I love listening to the
[9668.30 → 9674.38] wan show Maude at work wondering what your worst package delivery experience has been any lost
[9674.38 → 9680.70] damage or stolen packages I've got a good one for this cool I've got a couple um i at one point
[9680.70 → 9686.94] in time I was really trying to fix my posture so i I did buy an expensive thing spoiler alert I returned
[9686.94 → 9694.14] it but um I did buy an expensive thing I bought an ermine miller chair um did you just say ermine I didn't
[9694.14 → 9699.90] mean to do that but I did I like it, you know what I'm going to go with that it's ermine now yeah I mean
[9699.90 → 9706.54] you've got Hermes um yeah yeah I think it was the embody or something I don't remember what but uh this
[9706.54 → 9717.50] is when I totally didn't live um under the the the old studio house and they delivered it I didn't
[9717.50 → 9721.98] get a confirmation of the delivery and they just left it on the lawn in the front
[9721.98 → 9728.86] when they deliver those chairs they're not like they require no assembly right it's an enormous
[9728.86 → 9736.22] box right and they just left it on the lawn the like wet lawn super chill in the middle of suburbia
[9736.22 → 9741.34] with no one home they didn't get a confirmation signature that it was not a 2.5k chair just to
[9741.34 → 9746.14] be clear at that time it was a lot cheaper and I returned it I think it was about a grand it was a lot
[9746.86 → 9750.94] it was a big deal but I was like I'm gonna you know I spent a lot of time sitting in the chair my posture
[9750.94 → 9755.66] she's terrible I'm going to try to get a good chair, and it showed up I was pissed that it was just like
[9755.66 → 9763.10] abandoned in the lawn I drag it inside I didn't like it that much I just returned it oh well I got a
[9763.10 → 9768.94] couple good ones um one of them is very similar so do you did you ever check out the video we did on
[9768.94 → 9778.78] the cousin's uh scorpion chair oh yeah when they delivered that the title was not a lie the title was you
[9778.78 → 9785.34] know obviously not that descriptive so you could describe it as kind of clickbait in that sense
[9785.34 → 9791.26] because we were like they left this in my driveway right okay but I personally am fine with that as
[9791.26 → 9798.14] long as it is reflective of the reality of the situation, and they did they left it not in my
[9798.14 → 9804.94] driveway at home but effectively in our driveway at work whatever courier they contracted why is this
[9804.94 → 9810.78] happening just like why is it chairing a giant freaking crate like essentially in the parking
[9810.78 → 9815.74] lot at our studio and I don't blame cousin's for this to be clear I think it must have been some kind
[9815.74 → 9821.10] of miscommunication of some sort I don't I don't think I can attribute this one to malice there's got
[9821.10 → 9826.54] to be there's got to be an error a wire that got crossed somewhere um but one of my other favourite ones
[9826.54 → 9834.30] was when we did an um a sponsored video project with a pc builder and i think they asked us
[9834.94 → 9841.18] not to disclose who it was at some point like not or not to not disclose but not to um not to address
[9841.18 → 9845.98] that this had happened in the video because we thought it was hilarious, but they were like yeah our
[9845.98 → 9851.58] stuff being destroyed is just not that like you know on brand for us, we're not we're not into like
[9851.58 → 9859.42] we're not into like gore of our stuff being destroyed but this boutique beautiful gaming system
[9859.98 → 9867.90] got mangled like shattered tempered glass side panel and what was painful about this was that it
[9867.90 → 9874.78] was very customized and uh that really sucked that really sucked it's rough that was like entirely
[9874.78 → 9879.58] on the shipping company oh yeah yeah yeah it was packaged nicely and so and I think that was another
[9879.58 → 9882.86] thing that they had some sensitivity around was they were like yeah we really don't want people
[9882.86 → 9887.18] to think that this is reflective of our packing materials and I actually support that position
[9887.18 → 9892.22] for them because it was good their packing materials are excellent nice um but even the
[9892.22 → 9901.98] best packing materials can succumb to a dropkick all right what else we got okay hi do one of my hard
[9901.98 → 9907.74] drives on my NAS recently started reporting checksum errors and a colleague suggested running spin right
[9907.74 → 9916.06] on it to recover the data is that snake oil or does it work I have not tried it but I would say that
[9916.06 → 9922.38] if you're getting checksum or smart errors you should replace your drive what if he's doing raid zero then
[9922.38 → 9926.14] you should stop doing raid zero and then replace your drive yeah
[9929.18 → 9935.02] yeah why would you want to just people are saying spin right is so awesome okay maybe I need to
[9935.02 → 9941.90] familiarize myself with this why would this person want to run spin right on it instead of just
[9941.90 → 9950.06] replacing the drive maybe this is a drive in like help me out chat is it a single drive
[9952.70 → 9960.30] originally written as an interleave tool okay oh no so yeah spin rights ancient yeah yeah yeah I didn't
[9960.30 → 9965.26] that's okay that's super cool I mean I can't hurt to test it
[9967.58 → 9974.14] I don't know I'm at the point in my life where if is you're running it in raid one then I would say
[9974.14 → 9978.70] yeah I don't know run some utility on it, and maybe it's fine you'll have the redundancy still anyway
[9979.26 → 9984.46] um but I'm at a point in my life where when it comes to data if I see a smart error if I see a checksum
[9984.46 → 9991.58] error don't mess with it, I throw it away I'm sorry i um yeah people are like spin right is
[9991.58 → 9997.02] legit says Steve Gibson of Gibson research apparently this is according to OS dirk in the float plane chat
[9997.02 → 10003.34] didn't he make it I don't know oh yes wait what no don't cut the OS what are you doing what are you
[10003.34 → 10009.82] trying to do to me Obama giving Obama a medal yeah exactly good job Obama yeah guys
[10009.82 → 10017.82] I was like hold on a second all right uh plane is amazing perfect
[10019.66 → 10027.02] the best I've had your screwdriver for a year or oh no is this true what someone said
[10027.58 → 10031.42] are you guys trolling me right now hold on are you guys trolling me right now
[10031.98 → 10036.54] f car dude says you can only download spin right on Firefox there's no way that's true
[10036.54 → 10044.06] you guys got to be you guys got to be Memling on me there's absolutely no way I want to go see right
[10046.30 → 10047.18] why did they troll
[10054.46 → 10058.62] demo no they're always they're trolling they're trolling they're trolling they're trolling
[10058.62 → 10063.50] all right they're trolling okay I'm I'm ignoring you guys for a little bit that was a good one that
[10063.50 → 10070.30] was that was a good one that was gonna i it's exactly it is exactly the kind of thing that i
[10070.30 → 10079.74] could see just some meme ass developer being like oh yeah and doing I think oh yeah we have to call it
[10079.74 → 10083.42] on the lab site I know I've said it before on Wang so I won't go through it again but yeah
[10083.42 → 10090.38] I've had your screwdriver for a year or so now and love it and here's a question for Linus I'm new to
[10090.38 → 10095.90] having a cat how do you keep these young cats from tearing up furniture and your house they're starts um
[10095.90 → 10102.54] you can try yeah that helps uh you can try like orange scents I personally haven't found them that
[10102.54 → 10110.46] effective um you can try like fell away um like uh oh man what's the bloody like pheromone style like
[10110.46 → 10114.30] calming things i personally never found them that effective, and they're really expensive
[10114.86 → 10118.78] we've found the most effective thing is to take the spots where they like to scratch stuff
[10118.78 → 10123.42] and just put something else there, so there's there are spots on the carpet and there's like corners
[10123.42 → 10127.82] our house is just full of those cheap little like cardboard scratcher things that you can get on Amazon
[10127.82 → 10131.98] the cats love them they rip them up, but they're cheap you just get a new one whatever, and it's
[10131.98 → 10138.46] cardboard you just throw it in the recycling so who cares um the other big one is double-sided tape
[10138.46 → 10144.22] uh clear double-sided clear tape if you put that on a vertical surface that they go after
[10144.22 → 10148.86] it'll grab on the fur on their paws, and they don't they don't like it yeah they don't like it
[10148.86 → 10154.86] it makes sense it'll get them out of the habit sometimes there are just materials though
[10155.42 → 10161.90] that are just irresistible to them, and you're just going to have to get a different couch when that one is
[10161.90 → 10167.90] destroyed that's just part of break that couch up fur fino asks
[10168.46 → 10177.74] is declawing unethical um as we discussed earlier on the show um ethics and morals different concepts
[10178.70 → 10187.26] i I think it is highly immoral I think it is disgusting if you understand what you are doing
[10188.86 → 10196.14] and you still go forward with it, I don't think we can ever be friends um declawing a cat is not like
[10196.14 → 10199.98] like just pulling the fingernail off of a human finger which would already be bad enough
[10199.98 → 10207.42] declawing a cat is essentially cutting off their finger at this knuckle never do that
[10209.66 → 10216.46] i I like i I mean I didn't know that I'm not a cat person um declawing is amputation yeah it's brutal
[10216.46 → 10223.82] yeah what drives me nuts is when people clip bird wings super common oh interesting because they don't want
[10223.82 → 10227.50] them flying around their house, but they want to let them out of the cage, and it's easier to get
[10227.50 → 10232.06] them to like to sit on you if you clip their wings so they can't fly away, so my aunt used to always clip
[10232.06 → 10238.30] them a little so they could fly for a while but then like they couldn't like to take off yeah what
[10238.30 → 10244.14] would you what would you say to that I'm just that I don't know enough about that um it doesn't hurt them
[10244.14 → 10248.30] just to be clear it's just guys I'm not saying it's the same I'm not saying it's the same he's not
[10248.30 → 10253.98] saying it's the same you're taking an animal that is you know you're not you're not it's a're not
[10253.98 → 10258.30] amputating the wing of the bird or something like that, but you're taking an animal that is supposed
[10258.30 → 10264.06] to fly and has instincts to fly, and you're not allowing that so it'll try, and it'll flop over
[10264.94 → 10270.70] and it won't understand why it can't fly and that's like if you understand what's going on when it is
[10270.70 → 10276.14] confused about why it can't fly like that's depressing I don't know it's not it's not the same thing as
[10276.14 → 10282.62] cutting a hand off or something like that, but it's like uh it's pretty rough um I'm not a fan of it i
[10282.62 → 10291.98] I do think there are potentially some benefits to wing clipping at the very beginning um so that they
[10291.98 → 10298.22] get used to like walking around on the floor and stuff and get comfortable with this the ground
[10298.22 → 10304.22] space um so that if they do get like frightened and then fly around for too long and run out of gas
[10304.22 → 10307.58] before they get to a good landing spot and land on the ground they're comfortable that's the thing
[10307.58 → 10311.74] a lot of people don't know is birds can't fly for like that long yeah they have like no energy
[10311.74 → 10316.86] reserves indoors when there's no like drafts and stuff to keep them up when it's just wing power
[10316.86 → 10323.66] yeah they're going to gas out for sure yeah um Alan asks what about desexing also amputation right
[10324.22 → 10328.30] by desexing do you mean like fixing and neutering spaying and neutering because
[10328.30 → 10338.06] they're right now um uh miss and panda are recovering from their spay and neuter operations
[10338.78 → 10346.38] i am fully spay and neuter your pets people cats dude are literally an invasive species that is
[10346.38 → 10353.66] a threat to many other species particularly birds um, and we don't need more of them we have enough of
[10353.66 → 10362.38] them uh spay and neuter your pets guys how now DLL cow took my commuter bag on its maiden voyage today
[10362.38 → 10368.70] when will you offer the titanium carabiner's collection kit of the big backpack in the store
[10368.70 → 10378.46] so I can upgrade my commuter oh uh we weren't planning to um that's I don't know its kind of a cool idea
[10378.46 → 10384.46] because a lot of people didn't redeem them so we like to have a bunch of them um I think we're using
[10384.46 → 10389.82] some of them it's called liability material so uh like extras I think we're using some of our
[10389.82 → 10396.62] liability carabiners for a cool like ultra lightweight um jacket that stuffs up into one of
[10396.62 → 10400.70] the pockets, and then you zip it, and then it has like a carabiner so you can like to clip it onto your
[10400.70 → 10406.46] backpack or whatever um that's we're making one of those yeah that it is really nice I had one for
[10406.46 → 10413.66] years and then uh it should have survived this it is not her fault it is like on the website it says
[10413.66 → 10417.42] it should survive this but Emma threw it in the washer and it just whoops doodles shredded
[10417.42 → 10424.22] itself it's um it was very old it's super cool so what it is the uh the pattern that's printed
[10424.22 → 10431.18] on it is the like microscopic structure of some metal I forget what it is, but it's like a metal that's
[10431.18 → 10436.06] relevant to like one of our one of our long-time collaborators or something like that I think it might be
[10436.06 → 10439.98] it might be whatever metal framework uses in their chassis or something like that like it's uh i
[10439.98 → 10445.02] don't I forget that Tatiana would know all the details um sure, but it's got a cool pattern but
[10445.02 → 10448.14] it's got a really cool pattern it looks really cool it's not going to be cheap because it's like
[10448.14 → 10453.10] really lightweight but still really high performance material and stuff, but it's cool
[10453.10 → 10460.62] did you see anything on the technical side when backstage or on set of the jimmy Fallon show that
[10460.62 → 10465.26] you would like to adopt or integrate into the production of LDT videos question what impressed
[10465.26 → 10470.78] you the most the thing that impressed me the most was just generally the smoothness like there's
[10470.78 → 10478.54] monitors everywhere the entire studio area is plumbed with the audio from the show, so everyone knows
[10478.54 → 10486.22] like what's going on um which is like great for just situational awareness um mostly I'm not gonna
[10486.22 → 10490.78] lie I didn't recognize most of the equipment that they were using they're operating on a completely
[10490.78 → 10497.50] different level yeah and our sets are designed to be quickly modularly dynamically moved around
[10498.06 → 10505.74] that is a permanent set they do one thing yeah, and they do it real good it's a lot easier to do
[10505.74 → 10511.26] one thing incredibly well I'd say the smoothness of everything i was just super impressed by the
[10511.26 → 10511.42] team
[10513.90 → 10522.22] hi Wanda do my first Ltd video was Luke's great Geodude pc after the Bulbasaur pc what would you
[10522.22 → 10526.78] like to build next I'm not building another one anytime soon I'd love to see a magic carp or
[10526.78 → 10533.18] Gyarados theme in the thermal take immersion case okay now I'm tempted I told you this would get
[10533.18 → 10536.94] you can't do the immersion thing because you don't want the liquid with the birds yeah yeah but you
[10536.94 → 10543.10] can have it at work no with it department doesn't need to deal with that with uh with my
[10543.10 → 10547.90] roommate out it could be more viable depending on where we end up situating things but I would still
[10547.90 → 10554.86] probably want them to be somewhat I don't know yeah yeah I'm thinking of upgrading my computer from
[10554.86 → 10563.10] horizon 7 2700x but keeping my RTX 3080 since I only do 1440p or should I go all the marbles and get the new 50 series
[10563.18 → 10570.38] 3080 is still a really decent card here's the thing here's an answer that people don't give enough
[10572.38 → 10579.02] try it how am I supposed to answer that question for you upgrade your CPU and your motherboard and
[10579.02 → 10583.74] and oh yeah and then see if you're happy with it because you're going to get a nice little performance
[10583.74 → 10589.10] uplift and then if you're not happy with it well hey this gives you a little bit of time you can, it's
[10589.10 → 10594.78] not like it's not usable you can use your system with the 3080 play some games and then when it's
[10594.78 → 10600.06] when you're in a comfortable financial position to upgrade it go for it the good news is that with
[10600.06 → 10605.82] the way things are looking based on the pricing that NVIDIA announced for the 50 series 40 series
[10605.82 → 10611.58] and 30 series might continue to hold their value pretty okay so yeah yeah go for it yeah
[10611.58 → 10617.90] honestly 3080s are still beast they're still decent yeah the only reason that I'm upgrading mine is
[10617.90 → 10624.94] like because I can and like I really want a new one which is and that's fine and fair enough yeah it's
[10624.94 → 10631.10] not rational though also I have a like uh I have a 480 hertz monitor on my desk right now or 500 whatever
[10631.10 → 10635.18] whatever the last like Asus the only thing that really has me interested in the 50 series
[10635.18 → 10641.50] stuff is the AI capabilities for non-gaming things that's that's very interesting
[10643.74 → 10648.38] but as far as games go like I don't know especially if you're turning on the technologies that they
[10648.38 → 10654.94] they want you to then it's like I don't know yeah 4080 is pretty freaking fast if you turn on like frame
[10654.94 → 10660.30] gen yeah and even if you don't if you have a 4080 like you're crushing everything anyway I don't know
[10660.30 → 10667.66] yeah, and you're 4080 right yeah, yeah okay Luke I'll give you compute time on mine are you buying one
[10667.66 → 10676.30] i I would like to i think this year is the time I get a founder um obviously a completely
[10676.30 → 10682.54] irrational purchase i just kind of want one it's a meme especially with nick, but it's a meme with the
[10682.54 → 10688.38] labs team that was down at CES how much I think the dual flow through fans are so freaking cool and
[10688.38 → 10694.46] it's a two-slot I want it because it's a two-slot it's super cool it's a founder I want one for the
[10694.46 → 10702.06] AI stuff I've already got very many expensive founders is amazing save Luke money riddle me this
[10702.06 → 10705.50] Dan you can have to compute what are you going to install in your other PCIE slots now that you've
[10705.50 → 10712.14] freed them up uh well I have dual slot really I have seven on the other one well i, and it can't
[10712.14 → 10720.78] I can barely fit my NVMe PCI my card or my USB card, but it does fit yeah it's like touching the fans
[10724.30 → 10731.18] I want a smaller computer like I've already said it's not a reasonable like purchase
[10732.38 → 10738.46] none of the third parties are going to do two slots so yeah all right I don't have to defend myself
[10738.46 → 10744.30] because it's a stupid purchase that's fair I mean if you take a lot of the wind out of the
[10744.30 → 10750.70] sails of your detractors if you're just like I am making a bad decision yeah I am doing so knowingly
[10750.70 → 10756.54] and wilfully I'm doing this for joy not because it's smart i just I think you know that
[10756.54 → 10760.62] thing I was talking to you about like a long time ago when I started laying out predictions for AI
[10760.62 → 10766.94] stuff and I was like companies are going to have effectively like mainframes again on-prem yeah that's like
[10766.94 → 10776.70] happening big time right now um and part of it is like I don't want to fall behind so like
[10777.50 → 10782.62] what my job is I like I'm not no I'm not going to try to expense one in my personal computer don't worry
[10782.62 → 10788.94] about it yeah you aren't but I part of me is like I need to start working with like local AI systems
[10788.94 → 10794.06] more I've been very aware of them well maybe what we should do is we should build like a local AI
[10794.06 → 10798.70] compute machine that everyone can kind of share time on, and we'll just like put it in the lab
[10798.70 → 10803.58] in the lab server room and like is would that be kind of a helpful solution potentially yeah yeah
[10803.58 → 10807.98] we've been talking about it especially with like the cool video whatever it's called digits yeah that
[10807.98 → 10814.06] was an idea too like do we get a digit I think we should get at least one yeah I'm looking at that
[10814.06 → 10817.42] I'm not that convinced for three grand I'm not that convinced you couldn't just build a three
[10817.42 → 10821.90] thousand dollar tower and put a freaking 50 90 in it, we try to see which one's more viable do you
[10821.90 → 10830.22] want to play with mine yeah well part of it's also the ram being able to yep sorry what was that Dan
[10830.22 → 10834.46] do you want to play with mine as like a test run because that's what I built what a thing to say if
[10834.46 → 10840.22] we didn't have the context for it context really does matter doesn't it yeah wait what do you mean
[10840.78 → 10843.98] well because I asked if you want to play with his you want to play with mine do you want to play with
[10843.98 → 10852.86] his do you want to play with Dan's I built a mule but I'm talking Blackwell uh no well I mean I will
[10852.86 → 10859.02] if you want I'll put the 50 90 in it but I was kind of hoping to how many this is one question
[10859.02 → 10866.54] I have Dan it's how many 50 90s one are you sure yes how many 40 90s do you have yet one oh how many
[10866.54 → 10873.10] 40 90s did you have Dan what do you mean did just that so oh wait was it 30 90s you had a bunch of don't
[10873.10 → 10881.34] ask how many 30 90s do you have Dan three why and two 2080 tis because you can get them super
[10881.34 → 10887.98] cheap when they're abused by uh by mining and barely run, and then we'll continue to be a bruised
[10887.98 → 10894.06] mean I don't know what does that even mean in the context of a GPU what the fan is broken like what
[10894.06 → 10900.30] are we even talking about yeah you're right people keep asking uh what's digits it's its this
[10900.30 → 10906.86] NVIDIA project digits it's this little thing right here yeah it's a little like it looks kind of like
[10906.86 → 10915.82] a Mac mini um golden because of course it is arm CPUs and uh and um grace Blackwell so it's a grace
[10915.82 → 10924.54] Blackwell sorry grace uh CPUs and Blackwell GPU yeah yeah cool that's what it is basically it's a
[10924.54 → 10931.34] it's an it's an it's a dev platform AI dev box yeah yeah uh but yeah i I mean nick in the lab has shown
[10931.34 → 10938.22] a lot of interest in this type of stuff yeah um it's like clearly where things are kind of
[10938.22 → 10948.70] headed um and I need to not fall behind so you're welcome to time on my box that's why I built Dan
[10948.70 → 10956.38] oh holy dude well okay we shot a video recently and I called it by its actual name so
[10959.58 → 10966.14] next merch message its brain cue we worked on it together when we did a company event no it's the
[10966.14 → 10973.34] naming it's what you called it I'm a child I'm sorry uh long time listener first time merch messenger my
[10973.34 → 10978.46] work involves optimization for manufacturing and logistics can you share any insights on how leg and
[10978.46 → 10986.14] CW plans and manages these fields keep being awesome nope and the answer is I just don't know
[10986.94 → 10995.42] um I don't do much on the operations side these days and as far as creator warehouse we uh we hired Patrick
[10995.42 → 11003.02] who I used to work with at NCI to be our third-party logistics company so oh um you know nick obviously or
[11003.02 → 11007.82] like you know Dave from the CW team would coordinate with Patrick or whatever but I only see Patrick
[11007.82 → 11013.58] every once in a while to be like how's it going crisp high five thanks for your business you know
[11015.66 → 11019.74] thanks for your partnership yeah sorry guys I don't I don't have much to contribute there
[11022.30 → 11027.98] Linus came across the 10 years of gaming pc's vid yeah I loved how it catalogued the history of each era
[11027.98 → 11032.86] do you think creating a series that contextualizes pc history through each hardware generation
[11032.86 → 11040.46] is worth it I think that sounds like an enormous super cool project, and it's exactly the kind of thing
[11040.46 → 11047.34] that I would love to put in like you know the LTT tech museum or something like that like i kind of
[11048.46 → 11053.66] okay I don't want anybody to get excited about this, but it's its on a dock of like potential
[11053.66 → 11061.74] potential business ideas you know or potential future ideas in all likelihood that is not
[11061.74 → 11067.26] going anywhere um, but it was something that I thought would be really cool because it would
[11067.26 → 11076.54] both act as a funnel to create ideas for content, and it would be somewhere for us to put
[11076.54 → 11081.26] some of the stuff that we create for content where people could actually interact with it and enjoy it like
[11081.26 → 11089.74] uh we oh we did such a cool video this week have you seen the all-in-one gaming TV no okay
[11090.54 → 11097.34] no well you're not going to find it we shot it this week oh yeah definitely not then all right let's see if I can find
[11098.94 → 11109.26] an early version of sort of taking this idea and doing something with it um when we just didn't have the resources
[11109.26 → 11116.78] resources or the time to do what we did this week I'm trying to find it, and it's so
[11117.58 → 11122.86] hard to search for things on YouTube these days I will be the first to admit that the way we title our videos
[11123.50 → 11124.78] doesn't always help
[11127.02 → 11134.78] but it is also really, really hard to search for stuff anyway we did a video we basically said okay
[11134.78 → 11140.30] hear me out what if TVs didn't really need to be that much thinner and what if it would be cooler
[11140.30 → 11145.66] if we just packed like way more features into them, we put like giant speakers in them, and we like
[11145.66 → 11152.70] integrated all this stuff so we built it we bought you remember those old rear projection TVs from like
[11152.70 → 11161.90] the mid 2000s we bought one a Sony we ripped everything out we gutted it in its place we put a brand
[11161.90 → 11171.18] new OLED panel okay yeah yeah we put a top of the line gaming pc we put a PlayStation 5 we put a Wii U
[11172.14 → 11178.94] and we put a switch including exterior access to the switch and in the front the little uh the little
[11178.94 → 11184.78] hinge to access like the front video we cut all that out we put the Wii U there so you pull down the
[11184.78 → 11192.06] little thing there's your Wii U boom disc the whole thing is completely sealed up so it's like the
[11192.06 → 11200.30] sleeper gaming TV it's so cool we use underrated honestly when I saw the bigger switch the first
[11200.30 → 11204.94] thing I thought was I hope it feels more like the Wii U controller did because the Wii U controller was
[11204.94 → 11214.62] like amazing yeah so it's a great video Alex uh Justin and Sebastian actually from CW out did themselves
[11215.26 → 11223.74] and it is almost looking factory good like the TV like the fit like it's so oh it's so good that's
[11223.74 → 11229.02] pretty sick it looks so unnatural and out of place I recorded a clip I don't know if it's going to make
[11229.02 → 11235.74] it into the edit but I was talking about how it looks like it's um it looks like it's screen
[11235.74 → 11241.66] replaced like in real life it looks like they wrote a scoped out whatever was on and like put content in
[11241.66 → 11248.38] in post like it just it looks unnaturally good it's so cool that's pretty why are we you ask black
[11248.38 → 11255.98] raven because it's amazing yeah because if it's like the ultimate emulation box it can do it natively
[11255.98 → 11263.50] plays what is it two generations plus even more with the uh if you've bought stuff in the in like
[11263.50 → 11268.30] the retro store which I forget what it's called the Wii U shop or whatever um plus you can put like
[11268.30 → 11273.98] homebrew firmware on it and run a bunch of other systems as well um it has native support for
[11274.62 → 11281.98] the game cube controller it has like man it's dude it's sick it's its actually a sick console also it
[11281.98 → 11287.82] does have a PS5 in it as well so switch Wii U PS5 and pc we didn't have an Xbox because we have a pc
[11287.82 → 11291.42] so what do you need an Xbox for if you have a like sick gaming pc yep
[11291.42 → 11296.14] Linus how do you feel about the s2 going back to the LCD screen
[11297.82 → 11305.58] what sorry I think that's the switch to maybe is that true we didn't talk about that I don't think
[11305.58 → 11311.02] uh is that final is that finalized is that no I confirmed oh it might be the galaxy s2
[11311.02 → 11317.90] no what is this must be switched to is this a thing I don't know see people are saying definitely not
[11317.90 → 11325.82] confirmed I'll be disappointed I'll be disappointed the OLED switch looks so good
[11328.78 → 11334.70] I hope not all right thank you for restocking the pet cave do your pets have nicknames my cat's
[11334.70 → 11339.74] nickname has overtaken, and she only gets called by her actual name when she's getting scolded shout
[11339.74 → 11346.70] out to melody aka the poor uh yeah oh definitely um they have so many nicknames so why don't I start
[11346.70 → 11355.26] with dash um dash yum doo, doo I think every pet has the nickname of its name but with e on it
[11355.26 → 11358.46] mm-hmm um my chunky girl
[11361.26 → 11367.58] she does the thing where uh she like eats defensively so she's gotten territorial about the food so she tries
[11367.58 → 11373.58] to eat it all so she's a little on the's a little on the chunkier side um and then uh what

[11408.46 → 11414.46] um and then I accidentally call them Oreo every once in a while because that was the other candidate name

[11445.02 → 11449.18] that's it no nicknames uh just variants of that
[11449.18 → 11456.46] hmm Dixie's a little hard to do variants of it already sounds like a variant uh scoop scoop whatever
[11456.46 → 11465.50] I don't know oops coop who got to choose the Fallon walk-on music I was as surprised as anyone did you
[11465.50 → 11472.46] notice no they played the peanuts theme song really yeah you could, it's an it's an older reference but it
[11472.46 → 11478.06] checks out yeah yeah yeah I wonder whose job is did you have no idea until you're walking out yeah
[11478.06 → 11484.86] wow I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't notice I only noticed it when I watched it back yeah and
[11484.86 → 11488.94] someone pointed it out to me, I don't even think I noticed it when I watched it back I was like dude i
[11490.30 → 11496.94] I was hopped up on so much adrenaline I had no idea what was going on I believe it I can be an I can
[11496.94 → 11507.74] be a stressed out boy sometimes i I heard nothing when I walked out yeah yeah yeah hey Linus and Luke
[11507.74 → 11511.82] I'm part of a high school robotics club, and we're working on getting funding for our team to purchase
[11511.82 → 11517.26] new machining tools do you have any advice on getting tech sponsorships dude it's tough um
[11518.94 → 11524.46] like I don't want to tell you to spam anybody but I do want to tell you to you know reach out broadly
[11524.46 → 11529.82] um I want to tell you to maybe some modern tools that can help you with that um
[11531.90 → 11539.42] make it personal you know ex lead with and okay here's a big one demonstrate that there is some
[11539.42 → 11545.34] chance that you guys are going to do something useful so show receipts for other really cool
[11545.34 → 11550.62] stuff that you or your teammates have done I would say that is a huge one that stands out to us
[11550.62 → 11557.26] Cohen lemon perfect advice start local like actually walk knock on doors um that can be a
[11557.26 → 11558.38] perfect idea as well
[11562.70 → 11567.10] any thoughts on the max more for money than sponsorships because like I don't know Texas
[11567.10 → 11572.78] instruments might not be in your town okay any thoughts on the max bandwidth that will ever be
[11572.78 → 11577.42] needed per person you have discussed this before, but it has only been a couple of years and I'm wondering
[11577.42 → 11581.34] if there's anything lately that would drive it up it's less that I think there's a max bandwidth
[11581.34 → 11588.30] that we need per person per se like I know we have talked about how there is kind of a max um
[11588.30 → 11596.94] conceivable bandwidth per person assuming that um you know beyond 8k never really happens because it's
[11596.94 → 11603.26] irrelevant to humans um outside of like VR applications where you're like stretching it way over the entire
[11603.26 → 11612.30] field of view um I am like streaming with low latency encoding at extremely high bit rates in
[11612.30 → 11616.14] the future like I don't know conceivably like more bandwidth but I think you're talking about internet
[11616.14 → 11620.70] bandwidth for me, it's less that I think there's a limit to how much bandwidth we could use like i
[11620.70 → 11628.78] wouldn't mind downloading uh black myth Kong in five seconds I'm sure yeah I'll bring it on, but there are
[11628.78 → 11637.82] cost and um point of diminishing returns points that are practical obstacles to that ever really
[11637.82 → 11644.94] happening um like companies that provide the bandwidth that they provide at the speed that they
[11644.94 → 11650.62] provide it essentially for free like steam doesn't get paid more for that game you bought if they give
[11650.62 → 11655.42] you faster download speeds it's basically they did get paid 30 for that game though yes, but it's its
[11655.42 → 11661.98] basically so they'd be making fat stats it's at their discretion though how much download bandwidth
[11661.98 → 11667.50] they determine they wish to give you, and so i just I haven't seen other than game downloads I haven't
[11667.50 → 11674.70] seen any and other big downloads I haven't really seen a practical use for much beyond you know two and
[11674.70 → 11680.70] a half gig um but I don't i know Jake is like amped that one of our local carriers is moving
[11680.70 → 11685.66] to I think five or ten gig to the just said in chat I'm getting Telus five gig next week yeah there
[11685.66 → 11690.22] you go I'm so jealous yeah there you go but I don't know what he's going to do with okay I know what
[11690.22 → 11693.98] he's going to do with it but I'm not going to talk about what he's going to do with it all right what's next
[11696.46 → 11701.74] we know hey LLD Linus I want to upgrade my first serious badminton gear what do you have any
[11701.74 → 11707.18] recommendations or tips with buying shoes rackets or shuttlecocks etc as with any time you buy shoes buy
[11707.18 → 11712.86] shoes that fit you that's the most important thing as for a racket a lot of places will let
[11712.86 → 11716.54] you trial them whether it's friends or other members in the badminton community people are
[11716.54 → 11722.70] super friendly um if you see something you like say hey can i play a know five points with it
[11722.70 → 11728.14] people are often very friendly if you are also friendly as for shuttles man are they ever
[11728.14 → 11732.94] getting affordable dude I should have invested in badminton shuttles because they're getting more
[11732.94 → 11737.42] affordable no because they're getting more expensive oh dude if I just said affordable
[11737.42 → 11742.62] no, no unaffordable sorry, sorry I meant to say unaffordable dude they're they're wild they're wild
[11742.62 → 11748.94] dude um try and find something you can afford wait if you're a badminton centre now is that good for you
[11748.94 → 11757.50] no oh our costs go up but don't you charge more yeah but like there's a limit like a tube of yonex
[11757.50 → 11763.42] as 50s is like 70 Canadian dollars retail now or something like that like it's what like there's
[11763.42 → 11769.42] 12 shuttles in there you miss hit one shot, and you spent like what's that what's that work at like
[11769.42 → 11775.90] eight dollars or no, no not eight dollars like five bucks though like 550 that's rough yeah that's
[11775.90 → 11783.50] crazy can we collect Luke's bird feathers and make mini ones no wait no it's its more than that hold on
[11783.50 → 11790.54] because their feathers are very small yeah you have like little yeah you play with like spoons it
[11790.54 → 11799.26] would also take forever oh that's pretty close uh let's see would you guys please consider
[11799.26 → 11804.78] publishing the source model files like the fusion or SolidWorks for the prints I work I can work with
[11804.78 → 11812.14] the models directly but having this saves me a bit of time in some cases that's a good question I am not
[11812.14 → 11818.78] the most experienced when it comes to things like 3d modelling so I have to assume that the team made
[11818.78 → 11824.62] the decision that they made for reasons that is a very reasonable way of asking though and um I would
[11824.62 → 11831.34] love to can we forward that to um oh who's on point for this I okay i I'll discuss it with the
[11831.34 → 11839.18] team on Monday thank you yes, thanks uh hey Linus how's the sv650 doing great and how dare you ask me
[11840.46 → 11849.10] uh not great i I primed a bunch of stuff and I have some runs so I need to go and send them back down
[11849.74 → 11854.62] and then I am so stressed because the fact that I'm having such a hard time putting the primer on evenly
[11854.62 → 11859.34] really does not bode well for the translucent for my second attempt at the translucent layer I'm just
[11860.38 → 11866.30] it's hard and I will do my it's its it everything is shaped so funky if I was painting the hood of a
[11866.30 → 11874.22] car or something huh easy but there are so many facets and so many different angles and little crevices and
[11874.22 → 11882.06] it will the magnetic chest strap for Ltd backpack work with the commuter bag
[11891.02 → 11893.42] it's an add-on isn't it yeah yeah
[11895.74 → 11901.10] oh he has both bags here do you have one of the magnetic straps no you're checking if the attachment
[11901.10 → 11902.38] points are the same yes
[11906.86 → 11912.86] they appear to be the same but I would double-check with support yeah there does not appear
[11912.86 → 11917.10] to be any reason why you wouldn't be able to put the magnetic chest strap on the commuter bag
[11920.22 → 11927.66] that's all I got well then that's all I got to thank you guys very much uh coming back to how we started
[11927.66 → 11934.86] the show today for your support um for being a part of a positive part of this community and uh we
[11934.86 → 11951.42] appreciate you all we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
