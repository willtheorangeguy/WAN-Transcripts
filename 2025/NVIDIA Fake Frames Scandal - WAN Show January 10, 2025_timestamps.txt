[2025-01-11T13:51:16Z] Video: NVIDIA Fake Frames Scandal - WAN Show January 10, 2025 
Is it just me or are the YouTube ads getting out of hand? I decided not to skip any ads for this video. I've been playing the video for 5 hours and I'm 1:01:25 into the actual content. That's 3:58:35 of ads. I skipped an ad to check the timestamp of the actual video and another ad is already playing. I haven't even gotten through half a comment without another ad break. I lost my TV remote and don't want to have to stop what I'm doing on my phone to skip ads every 3 minutes. It seems designed just to be as annoying as possible. You literally have to skip the ads if you want to watch this video within 12 hours. Anyone else noticing this??
