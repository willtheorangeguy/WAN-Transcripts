[0.00 → 12.04] What's up everyone and welcome to the WAN show.
[12.04 → 15.48] We have a great show lined up for you guys this week.
[15.58 → 26.04] We're going to be talking about NVIDIA being sued in a class action lawsuit by YouTubers.
[26.44 → 27.14] Let's go.
[27.14 → 30.82] Including H3H3 Productions.
[31.22 → 31.58] Oh.
[32.20 → 32.66] Yeah.
[33.50 → 36.92] Probably not what you thought I was about to say.
[37.32 → 44.04] In other major news, Storage Review, how could you?
[44.96 → 52.18] Storage Review has calculated by the 314 trillion digits.
[52.58 → 53.96] I think they just don't want us to be happy.
[53.96 → 56.72] That means our world record is broken.
[57.14 → 63.18] Someone's got to get 369 and then someone's got to get 420, and then I think the whole
[63.18 → 63.68] loop is...
[63.68 → 65.16] I think it's just over at that point.
[65.16 → 65.46] We can just wrap it up.
[65.46 → 65.86] Yeah.
[65.86 → 70.36] We can just tie a bow on it and put it in the closet.
[71.52 → 72.00] Yeah.
[72.36 → 74.52] And bring it out at Christmas.
[74.72 → 75.16] Special occasion.
[75.28 → 75.48] Yeah.
[75.76 → 76.70] It's Christmastime.
[76.94 → 77.14] Yeah.
[77.30 → 78.24] It's Christmastime.
[78.58 → 79.32] Storage Review.
[79.52 → 80.34] Great job.
[80.76 → 82.16] We'll be talking about that a little bit later.
[82.16 → 83.38] What else we got this week?
[83.46 → 89.28] Intel officially confirms BMG G31 Big Battle Mage GPU.
[89.60 → 89.78] Okay.
[89.82 → 93.58] See, I thought that was a big deal, but then that was the headline topic for Tech Linked.
[93.58 → 94.62] It was like, no one cared.
[94.76 → 96.72] The people don't care, but I care.
[96.82 → 97.22] Nice.
[97.76 → 101.02] And Philips wrote LTT a letter about Philips Fixable.
[101.54 → 102.88] Those are the two you pick?
[102.88 → 103.68] Are we back?
[103.68 → 104.68] Fixable?
[105.52 → 105.76] Yeah.
[105.88 → 106.74] I think that's cool.
[106.76 → 107.74] No, I think Fixable is back.
[107.80 → 109.08] I think Fixable is cool.
[109.22 → 109.78] Yeah, that's sick.
[109.84 → 110.10] All right.
[110.14 → 110.94] We'll talk about it.
[111.16 → 111.56] Okay.
[111.56 → 111.68] Okay.
[111.68 → 137.16] The show is brought to you by Odom, AMD, ProtonMail, and Odd Pieces.
[137.16 → 141.92] Alongside, of course, our wrap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner, Secret.
[143.72 → 144.40] Nice try.
[144.90 → 145.96] I shouldn't have looked at it.
[147.58 → 149.20] I didn't even do that this week.
[149.26 → 149.76] You know what?
[150.88 → 151.32] Vertical.
[156.04 → 157.24] No one's happy.
[157.24 → 159.90] I'm going to make it worse than ever.
[159.90 → 178.24] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic this week, which is, of course, that storage review has regained a computational record by solving Pi to 314 trillion digits.
[178.24 → 205.28] They used, and this is a quote, a single 2U Dell Power Edge R7725 server equipped with dual AMD EPIC 192 core CPUs alongside, wait, 40, 61.44 terabyte micron 6550 ion SSDs.
[205.28 → 209.26] And you know why you should be angry about that?
[210.00 → 221.80] Not because storage review has embarrassed your favourite YouTuber who makes tech videos on a regular basis in Coverdale, British Columbia.
[222.66 → 224.62] See how I narrowed that down there?
[224.70 → 225.06] You did.
[225.26 → 225.96] I really did.
[226.08 → 226.28] Yep.
[226.52 → 226.74] Yep.
[226.74 → 235.90] You should be upset because it turns out storage review were the ones responsible for the NAND flash shortage crisis.
[236.64 → 237.96] How much is that?
[238.62 → 243.22] That's two and a half petabytes of SSDs for crying out loud.
[243.38 → 244.06] That is pretty crazy.
[244.14 → 245.40] But that's necessary.
[245.40 → 248.98] That's actually something that you need in order to store all that.
[249.04 → 252.34] I mean, we made a whole video about it, and you can sort of go check that out.
[252.52 → 253.76] Pretty much same idea.
[254.48 → 260.46] Their record run was a 110-day total runtime, and this is great.
[260.56 → 268.06] According to their article, they focused on record-setting power efficiency, which, I got to be honest with you,
[268.06 → 272.98] makes a ton of sense to me as the one who paid for power last time around.
[275.56 → 281.40] I had no idea how much we had spent on that endeavour until we were already done.
[281.68 → 283.08] It was ludicrous.
[286.52 → 290.42] Discussion question is, are you going to freaking take this, bro?
[290.58 → 291.66] What are you going to do about it?
[291.74 → 293.24] I'm going to freaking take it.
[293.34 → 293.56] Yeah.
[293.80 → 294.60] I'm going to take it.
[294.68 → 295.32] I'm going to be just...
[295.32 → 295.88] I think...
[295.88 → 297.28] Oh, my...
[297.28 → 300.30] I don't even care.
[300.40 → 300.90] I'm good.
[301.84 → 304.04] I've got my certificate from last time.
[307.68 → 308.74] They can have it.
[309.00 → 311.94] I think what we're going to do about it is maybe encourage...
[311.94 → 313.56] Oh, man.
[314.32 → 317.16] I think what we're going to do about it is encourage them to go for 369.
[317.38 → 318.60] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[318.74 → 319.34] Yeah, be a man.
[319.82 → 320.74] Beat your own record.
[320.84 → 321.42] Be a man.
[321.74 → 321.94] Yeah.
[322.04 → 322.68] Do the right thing.
[322.68 → 323.56] And then do it twice.
[323.70 → 324.46] Beat your own record.
[324.58 → 327.18] Go to 369, and then beat your own record again with 420.
[327.28 → 332.94] And maybe you can, you know, wait for jumps in technology in order to do that so it's
[332.94 → 334.38] like a little bit more interesting every time.
[334.42 → 334.58] Yeah.
[334.58 → 335.78] There's like a bit of a story to it or whatever.
[336.10 → 336.84] But still...
[336.84 → 337.46] Yeah.
[337.46 → 338.52] And we'll root for you.
[338.62 → 338.74] Yeah.
[338.74 → 340.40] We're going to root for you from the sidelines.
[340.56 → 340.70] Yeah.
[340.70 → 342.94] And he'll do it really enthusiastically.
[342.94 → 343.18] Wait.
[346.68 → 347.78] All right.
[347.84 → 352.06] Why don't we jump into one of the other topics that I'm very interested in.
[352.26 → 357.90] And I am mostly doing this because I haven't kept up with the news here, and I am reading
[357.90 → 359.12] this for the first time.
[359.20 → 361.18] So I'll be finding out exactly what the heck is going on.
[361.18 → 368.08] NVIDIA is apparently being sued in a class action lawsuit for copyright infringement by
[368.08 → 374.16] three YouTubers after NVIDIA used their videos to train their new AI model.
[374.84 → 382.32] YouTube creators TED Entertainment, H3H3 Productions and H3 Podcast Highlights, Matt Fisher, Mr.
[382.32 → 389.36] Short Game, and Golfholics have filed a proposed class action lawsuit against NVIDIA saying that
[389.36 → 396.26] the company used their YouTube videos without permission to train its AI video model, Cosmos.
[396.88 → 404.22] The creators say that YouTube only allows videos to be streamed, not downloaded, and that NVIDIA
[404.22 → 409.50] allegedly bypassed YouTube's protections to get the actual video files anyway.
[409.50 → 412.58] Could we call this a form of...
[412.58 → 414.30] What's the word I'm looking for?
[415.18 → 416.90] There's definitely a word for it.
[417.22 → 417.90] It's great.
[418.00 → 419.94] Like, what part of this are you trying to define?
[420.52 → 423.60] Well, I'm almost afraid to say the word.
[423.72 → 424.50] Is this...
[424.50 → 427.60] Is this piracy?
[427.80 → 427.96] Oh.
[433.46 → 434.54] Chat's going nuts.
[435.14 → 438.02] I got you.
[438.02 → 441.10] See, watching a video on...
[441.10 → 442.42] I just thought it was obvious.
[442.54 → 443.84] I thought he was looking for something else.
[444.04 → 449.80] See, watching a video on YouTube is not, in fact, the same as owning the file.
[450.28 → 456.02] There are terms of service, and there is a licensing agreement for the use of the content.
[456.18 → 461.44] Anyway, the lawsuit claims that NVIDIA crossed that line.
[461.44 → 467.50] The case focuses on huge AI datasets made up of YouTube links and timestamps, rather than
[467.50 → 468.58] the videos themselves.
[469.30 → 474.52] To use those datasets, though, the creators argue NVIDIA had to download the videos directly
[474.52 → 481.64] from YouTube, often repeatedly, to extract short clips, resulting in millions of unauthorized
[481.64 → 482.12] copies.
[482.12 → 489.30] The creators are suing under the DMCA's anti-circumvention rules, saying that NVIDIA broke YouTube's access
[489.30 → 494.36] controls to get files it was never allowed to have, and they are asking for damages and
[494.36 → 497.98] a court order to stop the practice.
[498.64 → 498.70] Huh.
[498.70 → 505.40] Members on our Subreddit found several LMG videos in the datasets from different channels.
[505.54 → 511.42] So, our first discussion question is, do we intend to join the class action lawsuit?
[511.96 → 518.92] And I'm just going to say the same thing that I always say, and that is, honestly, no.
[520.78 → 523.80] We are not a particularly litigious company.
[524.00 → 525.70] I am not a litigious person.
[525.70 → 530.06] I am mostly a live and let live kind of guy.
[530.40 → 532.20] I'm a little bit peeved.
[532.62 → 533.78] I don't like this.
[534.58 → 541.56] I would like to be compensated when my copyrighted intellectual property is used.
[542.18 → 547.58] However, I also have the self-awareness to recognize that, you know, not every way that
[547.58 → 552.70] I've ever used any copyrighted piece of material has been 100% perfect.
[552.70 → 555.92] So, you know, live.
[557.12 → 557.90] Let live.
[558.04 → 563.20] I do think there's a difference between you doing that as a person and NVIDIA doing that
[563.20 → 563.86] as a corporation.
[564.06 → 565.34] Sure, but we do it as a company, too.
[565.82 → 568.26] I mean, we'll throw, we'll put a meme in our videos sometimes.
[569.26 → 571.52] And, like, memes, it's funny.
[571.62 → 574.52] People seem to kind of, like, forget this.
[574.60 → 575.96] Be magically more okay with that.
[575.96 → 582.24] But, you know, throwing, like, throwing, like, a very short portion of, like, John Cena's
[582.24 → 588.94] walkout music into the intro of a video where I'm wearing a singlet, you know, technically,
[589.56 → 592.26] like, if they wanted to be a**holes about it, right?
[592.34 → 594.14] Like, they could go after us about it.
[594.14 → 599.68] But I think as long as everyone kind of goes, you know, in good faith, are we all kind of
[599.68 → 604.74] just borrowing lightly but not damaging the market for the original content?
[604.92 → 608.02] You know, basic pillars of kind of fair use.
[608.36 → 609.80] Then, you know, whatever.
[610.00 → 614.36] I think NVIDIA probably, yeah, fair use, probably not.
[614.36 → 619.76] But I just, the way that I see it, that's in the past.
[620.36 → 625.08] And the better focus for us going forward is to just kind of keep making the best possible
[625.08 → 630.08] content that we can and keep making better content than whatever it is that NVIDIA could
[630.08 → 634.60] AI slop out with this model that they trained on our old stuff and just keep moving forward.
[634.84 → 637.36] That's, yeah, it's not ideal.
[637.52 → 638.08] I don't like it.
[638.76 → 639.62] I don't like it.
[639.62 → 644.10] And there are areas where eventually, you know, you're going to cross a line with me.
[645.00 → 655.40] Like, I had, I had, like, one of those stupid AI celebrity chat, chatbot things reach out to me.
[655.56 → 659.84] And they're like, oh, you should do, like, an official Linus Tech Tips one.
[660.10 → 661.66] And we'll help you set it up.
[661.68 → 662.20] And we'll do this.
[662.22 → 662.86] And we'll do that.
[663.36 → 664.98] And I basically responded.
[665.10 → 666.90] I was like, no, you won't.
[666.90 → 670.88] And I explicitly am telling you I do not authorize that.
[671.00 → 671.58] So don't.
[672.06 → 674.24] And they basically were like, why not?
[675.36 → 688.34] Like, yeah, the fact that you don't understand that already tells me that any attempt that I make to explain it to you is a complete and utter waste of my time and will probably give me a headache.
[688.34 → 694.24] Like, the amount of people that would be covering you into the position that you went into earlier would be significant.
[695.60 → 697.26] It's a chatbot, Luke.
[697.44 → 697.72] Uh-huh.
[698.48 → 699.50] You don't think people do that?
[701.40 → 702.78] Welcome to the world.
[702.78 → 705.18] What is this, phone sex?
[706.08 → 707.14] Like, I don't understand.
[707.32 → 708.66] Yeah, there's text versions of that.
[708.70 → 709.20] What are you talking about?
[709.30 → 711.04] Yeah, but just like...
[711.04 → 713.40] There are a lot of people that do this.
[714.02 → 714.22] Why?
[714.26 → 714.98] Did you not see that?
[715.04 → 715.30] Okay.
[715.54 → 717.38] I guess we have to catch up a little bit.
[718.06 → 730.02] When 5, ChatGPT 5 came out, a ton of people were like very upset because their like relationships ended because 5 had a different personality than 4O.
[730.02 → 731.02] I was there for that.
[731.02 → 733.44] Yeah, you don't think they're doing explicit things through text?
[735.22 → 738.76] Yeah, but it doesn't actually generate an image of anything.
[738.98 → 739.44] Like, it's...
[739.44 → 740.54] No, yeah, through text.
[743.12 → 743.60] Why?
[746.20 → 747.74] That part I can't explain.
[747.96 → 748.32] Okay.
[749.70 → 751.32] All I'm saying is it would happen.
[755.28 → 759.92] Well, anyway, I think that's pretty much all I have to say about that.
[759.92 → 762.58] NVIDIA, you know, maybe just don't.
[763.60 → 766.66] But also, I don't know, man.
[766.72 → 768.28] I feel like this whole...
[768.28 → 773.42] Does it make a difference to you significantly if they like to watch it properly or download it?
[774.46 → 775.76] And not just that, but...
[775.76 → 776.08] I don't know.
[776.16 → 777.34] Maybe there's a thing there.
[777.42 → 778.62] I'm just not really aware of it.
[778.88 → 787.24] But, you know, at this point, the, you know, okay, like, are we headed to artificial general intelligence on the current path that we're on?
[787.24 → 791.96] The consensus among people who actually seem to know appears to be no.
[792.08 → 793.52] This is not a path to that.
[793.52 → 806.78] However, this whole LLM thing, this whole machine, like, sort of generative machine learning thing, generative AI that we have going on right now, you know, is it kind of big deal?
[806.88 → 808.06] Is it going to change the world?
[808.14 → 808.86] That's no question.
[808.98 → 810.04] The answer there is yes.
[810.16 → 810.52] It will...
[810.52 → 811.30] It already has.
[811.30 → 813.42] It will change the world in some fashion or another.
[814.06 → 823.36] And the reality of it is that NVIDIA is only in trouble because they operate in a jurisdiction where, like, laws exist.
[824.22 → 830.84] So, someone, at some point, is going to train their video model on my videos.
[831.40 → 833.30] Like, do I...
[833.92 → 837.26] Does it make a difference to me if it's NVIDIA versus someone else?
[837.26 → 841.86] I mean, NVIDIA has, you know, their $5 trillion valuation or whatever they're up to at this point.
[841.94 → 846.50] So, they're certainly a much better target to go after in terms of recouping some money from them.
[847.08 → 851.50] On that note, did you see the big deal that Disney and OpenAI announced?
[852.02 → 852.30] No.
[852.30 → 871.14] A billion dollars and OpenAI through Sora is now officially licensed to generate snippets using iconic Disney characters like Darth Vader, Boba Fett, some of their more cartoon characters, Mickey Mouse.
[871.52 → 875.38] Like, I was pretty surprised to see that.
[875.38 → 887.34] And then, on almost the same day, I think, it was either the same day or it was almost the same day, Disney sent a cease and desist to Google over using their copyrighted works.
[887.34 → 894.98] So, they've got this partnership with OpenAI now, and they are clamping down on the use of their copyrighted materials elsewhere.
[895.32 → 897.60] We are in unprecedented times.
[897.60 → 905.02] And I just, I don't feel like walking into the arena with the NVIDIA's, OpenAI's, Disney's of the world.
[905.18 → 912.96] The main thing I'm upset about is they didn't pay their, their Flow plane subscription for the month to download all of it that way, officially.
[914.56 → 915.80] That would have been like $5.
[916.28 → 916.50] Yeah.
[916.80 → 917.54] They didn't do it.
[917.92 → 918.38] They pirated it.
[918.38 → 922.34] And that still wouldn't include a license to use it for commercial use anyway.
[925.24 → 927.08] At least it was a real way to download it.
[927.08 → 928.08] I mean, I guess.
[929.48 → 932.68] Is that, is that, would that constitute commercial use?
[933.56 → 934.00] Absolutely.
[934.62 → 936.30] I mean, they're using it to make money.
[936.40 → 939.20] I mean, well, AI industry make money.
[939.26 → 939.66] That's funny.
[939.76 → 945.02] But theoretically, they're using it to make money at some point.
[945.12 → 945.74] Yeah, I guess so.
[945.94 → 946.70] That's interesting.
[947.74 → 949.06] I wonder if our thing, hmm.
[949.94 → 950.20] Hmm.
[952.62 → 955.12] I'm going to just figure that out later and not talk about it.
[955.12 → 957.68] But anyway, next topic.
[959.02 → 959.98] We did two topics.
[960.10 → 961.10] Dan, what are we supposed to do now?
[961.26 → 961.44] Oh.
[962.36 → 963.92] You're way ahead of time.
[963.92 → 964.18] We did it really fast.
[964.20 → 965.00] Do another topic.
[965.08 → 965.76] No, no, that's fine.
[965.84 → 966.94] We can, we can do other stuff.
[967.20 → 968.66] Or we could do some merch messages.
[968.66 → 968.76] Yeah.
[969.24 → 969.66] We could, oh.
[970.30 → 970.62] Really?
[970.62 → 970.70] Really?
[970.70 → 970.92] Already?
[971.32 → 972.34] Is that what we do at this point?
[972.72 → 972.92] Oh.
[973.02 → 973.12] No.
[973.12 → 975.52] No, you do it, you do it 40 minutes from now.
[975.60 → 976.44] No, no, we should do that.
[976.52 → 977.18] We should do that.
[977.64 → 977.96] Because.
[978.52 → 979.76] There are a lot of things going on.
[979.76 → 981.96] Yeah, there's, there's a lot going on right now.
[981.96 → 984.16] I scrolled through that section earlier, and it's just like, what?
[984.60 → 986.80] Starting, of course, with Luke bringing up the website.
[986.96 → 987.34] Hey.
[987.44 → 989.04] So that he's ready to show off.
[989.50 → 991.52] Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[991.52 → 997.30] Oh, wait, no, before we talk about any product launches, we have some updates on the customs
[997.30 → 1000.58] fee issues that some customers have been experiencing.
[1000.58 → 1004.44] We recently found out that some customers outside the US and Canada were charged higher
[1004.44 → 1009.64] than expected customs fees due to an external clerical error that submitted declarations
[1009.64 → 1011.66] in USD rather than CAD.
[1012.22 → 1017.98] So an outside party didn't realize, because nobody knows what a Canadian dollar is, that
[1017.98 → 1024.06] our documentation was in Canadian dollars, and they said they were US dollars, which
[1024.06 → 1027.84] means that the value of the shipments was overstated by about 40%.
[1027.84 → 1029.54] That is annoying.
[1029.90 → 1030.82] Whoops dongles.
[1031.40 → 1032.16] It does make sense.
[1032.42 → 1036.84] If your order was affected, you will receive an email tonight with all the details.
[1037.28 → 1041.88] The issue has been fixed, so any new orders placed now will not be impacted.
[1042.40 → 1043.28] Knock on wood.
[1043.82 → 1047.94] We are working with our ship pick partners to make sure that any extra fees are refunded.
[1048.38 → 1053.42] So if you have an order on the way, do not refuse delivery, because we may not be able
[1053.42 → 1054.34] to resend it.
[1055.14 → 1057.70] Pay the bill as issued, we will take care of the refund.
[1057.84 → 1061.50] We're aiming to have all refunds completed by the end of next week, December 19th.
[1061.50 → 1066.00] If you have any other questions, please contact our wonderful customer service team of Trustworthy
[1066.00 → 1069.42] Bros, and we will get you sorted.
[1072.02 → 1073.28] Oh, about five minutes ago.
[1073.36 → 1073.72] Thanks, Adam.
[1075.08 → 1076.70] Now on to something more fun.
[1076.92 → 1077.78] Look at this thing.
[1077.98 → 1082.54] We just launched our teddy fleece jacket.
[1083.24 → 1085.44] This thing is ridiculously soft.
[1086.34 → 1087.66] Ridiculously cool.
[1088.04 → 1089.28] Look how cool it is.
[1089.40 → 1090.28] That's an epic photo.
[1090.50 → 1094.20] And is a must-have in your closet during the colder months.
[1094.20 → 1100.30] You can layer underneath it, and it just looks so good, whether you're going outdoors or hanging
[1100.30 → 1101.52] out indoors.
[1101.66 → 1105.14] It has lined sleeves, making it easy to wear.
[1105.50 → 1106.54] Lots of pockets.
[1107.00 → 1108.00] And of course...
[1108.00 → 1109.84] Luke, what are you doing?
[1110.40 → 1110.86] There you go.
[1110.94 → 1111.34] There's...
[1111.34 → 1111.52] Yeah.
[1111.52 → 1116.08] And of course, the colour is just so unique and stylish.
[1116.08 → 1122.48] We were going for kind of like a retro kind of 90s, but a little bit more modern.
[1122.90 → 1129.16] And like, I think that the team did just an absolute outstanding job of this.
[1129.70 → 1131.34] Freaking outstanding job.
[1131.34 → 1132.06] But it looks so good.
[1132.56 → 1132.74] Yeah.
[1133.64 → 1137.14] And not only are we bundling up for the cold weather with our teddy fleece, we're also
[1137.14 → 1140.56] bundling up some holiday deals right there at the top.
[1140.62 → 1140.88] Oh, no.
[1140.94 → 1141.20] You're good.
[1141.26 → 1141.76] Yeah, you got it.
[1141.96 → 1144.72] Until December 17th in the U.S.
[1144.72 → 1146.58] So this is the U.S. site.
[1146.68 → 1147.42] Is that what you're looking at?
[1147.54 → 1148.56] Please tell me you're on the U.S. site.
[1148.56 → 1150.14] Uh, yes.
[1150.40 → 1150.68] Nice.

[1167.96 → 1168.56] Oh, okay.
[1168.90 → 1172.42] We're giving away a free pair of Steel Series Arctic Nova 4X.
[1172.52 → 1175.04] That is $80 off.

[1190.48 → 1198.08] That is a massive $100 off for a big pack of cable management arches and, um, the like,

[1213.88 → 1215.58] leg.GG slash holiday deals.
[1215.70 → 1216.00] Finally!
[1216.44 → 1216.82] Uh, underscore.
[1217.56 → 1218.04] Oh, sorry.
[1218.14 → 1218.26] Yes.
[1218.48 → 1218.88] Really?
[1219.32 → 1219.66] Underscore?
[1220.36 → 1222.18] Uh, the site I'm on is underscored.
[1223.34 → 1223.78] Underscore?
[1223.84 → 1224.30] What does that mean?
[1225.08 → 1225.56] What do you mean?
[1226.02 → 1226.92] Where does it say underscore?
[1228.72 → 1229.12] Oh.
[1229.82 → 1230.52] Oh, okay.
[1230.74 → 1231.86] Oh, that's perfect to know.
[1231.86 → 1232.48] Thanks, Luke.
[1232.72 → 1233.34] Yeah, got you.
[1233.76 → 1235.80] The bundle up is also an underscore, by the way.
[1235.88 → 1236.84] It's bundle underscore up.
[1237.16 → 1237.42] Nice.
[1237.56 → 1239.32] I didn't hear you necessarily say it, so you might have said it right.
[1239.46 → 1239.68] Quality.
[1240.52 → 1242.44] Also, just an update for you guys.
[1242.60 → 1246.20] We have wrapped up our holiday loot drop draw.
[1246.36 → 1247.42] The sweepstakes that we did.
[1247.50 → 1250.86] Thank you to all who made purchases and submitted entries via mail.
[1251.58 → 1251.98] Oh!
[1252.50 → 1253.06] Crap.
[1253.28 → 1253.42] Okay.
[1253.68 → 1254.86] The LTTstore.com.
[1254.86 → 1257.04] Oh, I forgot to talk to you about that.
[1257.54 → 1257.78] Yeah.
[1257.88 → 1260.38] The LTTstore.com domain has the underscore in it.
[1260.60 → 1263.02] The LMG.GG one does not.
[1263.24 → 1263.68] Oh, okay.
[1264.16 → 1265.16] I'm sure they'll find it.
[1265.24 → 1269.02] I think he said it right, because you were probably saying the LMG.GG domain.
[1269.18 → 1269.84] They're going to find it.
[1270.34 → 1270.86] You'll be all right.
[1270.92 → 1271.46] I believe in them.
[1271.50 → 1272.04] You'll figure it out.
[1272.08 → 1272.82] They're going to buy something.
[1272.90 → 1273.66] They're going to send them a message.
[1273.66 → 1274.36] You'll figure it out.
[1274.36 → 1276.78] I wanted to give you guys an update on the loot drop contest.
[1276.92 → 1280.74] We got hundreds and hundreds of letters.
[1281.38 → 1288.10] So massive shout out to Jamie, who poor Jamie had to open almost all of them, including that
[1288.10 → 1294.86] super weird one from last week, as well as Sammy Jess, Adam P, Mitchell, Tanya, Victor,
[1294.96 → 1298.16] Ashley, and Conrad from the CW team.
[1298.32 → 1300.00] Tons of planning went into all of this.
[1300.00 → 1305.34] Anyway, we're going to be randomly drawing the winners for the Sennheiser HD 550s, or
[1305.34 → 1311.84] 550s, I think, and the DOG Ally X handheld gaming systems, but soon.
[1312.16 → 1315.32] Winners will be notified via email, and prizes will be sent once everything is confirmed.
[1315.40 → 1318.22] Okay, that's all the CW updates.
[1320.00 → 1320.72] 2,200.
[1321.74 → 1324.40] Does he have the box of them that I saw?
[1325.04 → 1327.12] How much work would it be for us to show?
[1327.12 → 1327.72] Actually, you know what?
[1327.74 → 1329.88] It's probably not worth it, because they're going to have return addresses.
[1330.00 → 1330.56] Risk, yeah.
[1330.90 → 1331.36] Yeah, okay.
[1331.46 → 1332.24] Forget it, forget it.
[1332.26 → 1334.96] But, like, I saw the boxes of frickin' letters.
[1335.12 → 1335.84] It was ridiculous.
[1336.36 → 1339.98] We are going to change that next time.
[1340.40 → 1342.14] Just so you guys know.
[1342.28 → 1342.66] How do you do that?
[1342.68 → 1345.34] So what you do is you...
[1345.34 → 1347.22] Is it one maximum or something?
[1347.22 → 1352.76] We had some people that were relatively new to the team who didn't know how you do this.
[1352.76 → 1358.42] So the way that we did it was you got an entry for placing an order over $100.
[1359.08 → 1359.44] Yeah.
[1359.58 → 1364.20] You also got an entry for putting a 50 cent stamp on a letter and sending it to us.
[1364.74 → 1370.24] So, obviously, thousands of people were like, oh, well, that's cheaper.
[1370.60 → 1374.48] And I'll do that every single day, and I'll date the mail so it goes blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1374.48 → 1376.70] Now, you have to have...
[1376.70 → 1378.02] Which, I mean, fair play.
[1378.26 → 1382.20] You have to have a no-purchase-necessary way to enter a sweepstake in Canada.
[1382.34 → 1384.20] Otherwise, it becomes gambling.
[1385.30 → 1392.30] So, in the future, we will, of course, still have a no-purchase-necessary way to enter the contest.
[1392.30 → 1402.58] However, what most retail entities do is they make that letter worth one entry, and then they make the purchase worth a lot more entries.
[1406.30 → 1412.52] So, the $100 plus order, we might make worth one entry per dollar spent.
[1413.06 → 1417.26] Well, it's 25 cents for the stamp, so you could do four entries per dollar.
[1417.26 → 1427.10] The letter, we make worth one entry, which is not going to be good use of your time, because you will not have meaningful odds of winning at that point.
[1427.20 → 1427.50] That makes sense.
[1428.04 → 1438.90] So, that's probably what we're going to do next time, but this time around, you guys got a wonderful opportunity to win for the sake of sending a letter.
[1438.90 → 1447.10] Sorry, there's a chat going.
[1447.96 → 1452.66] If we're going to try to hide the location of the tech house, the answer is no.
[1454.30 → 1455.90] We're not going to blur everything.
[1456.00 → 1457.24] That's the whole point of the tech house.
[1458.64 → 1461.50] Yeah, I mean, we already work in the studio here.
[1461.50 → 1465.32] Like, obviously, we are going to, you know...
[1465.32 → 1467.34] Every one of our offices is Google Maps-able.
[1467.48 → 1469.08] I don't think we have to worry about it, too.
[1469.10 → 1469.96] Yeah, I...
[1469.96 → 1473.74] It doesn't substantially change the situation of anything.
[1473.84 → 1474.00] Nope.
[1474.80 → 1475.20] Nope.
[1475.30 → 1475.84] I think it'll be...
[1475.84 → 1476.86] I think it'll be fine.
[1477.40 → 1477.66] Yeah.
[1477.74 → 1478.24] Should be good.
[1478.38 → 1480.58] There are reviews of our company on Google Maps.
[1480.58 → 1481.38] Oh, there's so many.
[1481.76 → 1484.20] Most of them talking about how great the food is.
[1484.44 → 1484.76] Yeah.
[1485.50 → 1486.28] Just...
[1486.28 → 1488.10] Pretty wholesome meme, actually.
[1488.10 → 1488.30] Like...
[1488.30 → 1491.64] Hold on.
[1492.50 → 1494.48] This is flipping outstanding.
[1495.58 → 1496.60] Here we go.
[1497.02 → 1499.66] Sadly, I had to give three stars.
[1500.54 → 1502.20] I ordered a burger with some cheese.
[1502.38 → 1504.66] Sadly, the cheese was not melted.
[1506.10 → 1507.44] Not melted correctly.
[1507.72 → 1511.32] I ended up fighting this short man about the correct way to melt cheese.
[1512.32 → 1516.84] Four months ago, they have the best meals for picky eaters like my nephew.
[1516.84 → 1519.04] He doesn't eat Athlon chips.
[1519.22 → 1520.90] He only eats Ry zen chips.
[1522.02 → 1525.02] I got the light lettuce Lao lunch deal.
[1525.32 → 1526.20] And it was only $5.
[1529.34 → 1530.88] I didn't even know this was a thing.
[1530.92 → 1532.36] Because I mostly look at the labs.
[1533.00 → 1534.04] And the labs has liked one.
[1534.52 → 1534.96] Oh, really?
[1535.20 → 1535.38] Yeah.
[1535.44 → 1537.46] Well, it got deleted off Google Maps somehow.
[1537.62 → 1538.48] And then it came back.
[1538.52 → 1539.38] So it had a bunch.
[1539.44 → 1541.04] And then it got removed and came back.
[1541.08 → 1542.18] And it didn't have any anywhere.
[1543.26 → 1545.46] Our visit was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
[1545.46 → 1546.66] Oh, this one's like actually real.
[1546.70 → 1547.50] Oh, that's a real one.
[1547.62 → 1547.88] Boring.
[1548.48 → 1549.96] Best burger joint in Canada.
[1552.76 → 1554.00] Once-in-a-lifetime experience.
[1554.48 → 1554.80] Boring.
[1556.62 → 1557.60] I have to take this off.
[1557.66 → 1558.14] It's too warm.
[1558.58 → 1559.12] There you go.
[1559.76 → 1560.08] Dying.
[1561.44 → 1562.76] Did you see the colour of the zipper, though?
[1562.78 → 1563.32] How cool is that?
[1563.50 → 1565.18] I did think that's pretty cool, actually.
[1565.38 → 1567.06] I don't think I've ever seen a zipper that colour.
[1567.06 → 1568.14] PKK, as always.
[1568.44 → 1568.78] Mm-hmm.
[1570.56 → 1571.24] Oh, wow.
[1571.38 → 1572.52] Yeah, let's see the lab.
[1572.52 → 1573.96] Yeah, there are two reviews.
[1577.62 → 1579.74] Yeah, and it's no like food meme or anything.
[1579.90 → 1581.26] But they're going for it.
[1581.28 → 1583.44] One of them is just first, which that makes sense.
[1584.42 → 1584.76] Yeah.
[1585.04 → 1585.60] Fair enough.
[1585.86 → 1587.74] That would be a tech community thing to do.
[1587.90 → 1588.46] Nice shirt, dude.
[1590.22 → 1590.82] All right.
[1591.04 → 1593.88] Is that a privateering ship on there?
[1594.44 → 1594.74] This?
[1594.86 → 1595.24] Oh, yeah.
[1595.70 → 1596.54] It's a quality shirt.
[1597.20 → 1597.90] Quality shirt.
[1598.00 → 1599.00] Quality privateering.
[1599.00 → 1599.56] Mm-hmm.
[1601.80 → 1603.20] Is it another topic or what?
[1603.28 → 1604.14] We're doing that thing?
[1604.82 → 1606.94] We're continuing to do that, so we've got to explain merch messages?
[1607.16 → 1607.76] Is that what's going on?
[1608.24 → 1609.68] Yeah, we've got some merch messages.
[1609.68 → 1610.06] Oh, yeah, right.
[1610.12 → 1610.90] We're supposed to do that.
[1611.12 → 1614.58] We are not about you guys just throwing money at your screen.
[1615.04 → 1617.68] That is not necessarily the best play.
[1617.78 → 1623.12] The best play, if you want to interact with the stream, is to send a merch message.
[1623.50 → 1627.24] All you've got to do to send a merch message is gone to Luke's laptop instead of mine.
[1628.02 → 1632.44] Add anything to your cart, any of the high-quality merchandise over on LTTstore.com.
[1632.48 → 1634.98] We already ran through some of the great bundle deals that we're running right now,
[1635.02 → 1641.22] as well as just straight-up promos as we make our way into the final stretches of the holiday season here.
[1641.68 → 1646.66] Just go ahead, throw it in the cart, and as you go to check out, you will see the merch message box.
[1647.08 → 1648.80] You can either show your name or make it anonymous.
[1648.80 → 1652.98] You can type a little merch message, and then you can choose a colour scheme,
[1653.12 → 1656.14] and you can go ahead and place your order.
[1656.80 → 1661.62] Your message will go to Producer Dan, who will put it...
[1661.62 → 1662.98] That noise, wow.
[1663.04 → 1663.46] Yeah!
[1663.96 → 1664.66] Anyway...
[1664.66 → 1667.98] I only saw that in the proof rule.
[1668.50 → 1668.74] Wow.
[1669.16 → 1669.40] Stop!
[1670.98 → 1671.30] Wow.
[1671.68 → 1672.42] It's kind of moist.
[1672.70 → 1677.16] We'll go to Producer Dan, who will pop it up down here,
[1677.16 → 1679.20] who will reply to it himself,
[1679.62 → 1683.18] who will maybe forward it to someone who can answer your question better,
[1683.34 → 1687.70] or he will curate it for me and Luke to talk about.
[1688.22 → 1693.38] Dan, do you want to hit us with a couple of merch messages to show the people how we do it?
[1693.48 → 1694.52] Yeah, I've got a couple here.
[1694.94 → 1695.66] Hey, LLD.
[1696.06 → 1700.70] I've noticed a trend of people hating on new games that use old mechanics.
[1701.04 → 1703.94] If it's not open world or live service, people hate.
[1704.30 → 1706.74] What are your thoughts on where gaming trends are going?
[1707.58 → 1707.98] Really?
[1707.98 → 1709.28] Open world is an old mechanic.
[1709.80 → 1711.50] Well, I mean, I wouldn't.
[1711.64 → 1713.52] It depends on what you mean by old.
[1715.50 → 1716.92] Actually, now that I think about it,
[1717.14 → 1720.34] Link to the Past is pretty open world, isn't it?
[1720.36 → 1721.74] Red Guard is...
[1721.74 → 1722.38] No, not quite.
[1722.50 → 1729.28] No, it's gated in terms of where you're allowed to go
[1729.28 → 1730.22] because you get your new abilities.
[1730.46 → 1733.46] Yeah, there are games from the early 90s that are open world, technically.
[1733.46 → 1736.12] Okay, what's this Red Guard?
[1736.34 → 1736.68] What is it?
[1736.92 → 1738.38] I brought up Elder Scrolls Arena.
[1739.90 → 1741.34] No, Link to the Past is linear.
[1741.46 → 1742.82] Yeah, thanks, SKHS.
[1743.02 → 1745.90] Despite the naming, I'm pretty sure it's open world.
[1745.90 → 1749.76] It makes you feel like it's kind of open, but it's not properly open world.
[1751.14 → 1754.24] As for live service, man, f*** live service.
[1754.52 → 1758.86] I do not have time to devote my life to one game.
[1759.32 → 1762.72] I like my games to be where I start them,
[1762.88 → 1764.64] and then at some point they're done.
[1765.10 → 1770.54] I actually consider a new content pack every couple of weeks
[1770.54 → 1772.50] or every quarter or every month,
[1772.80 → 1775.38] I consider that to be a bug, not a feature.
[1775.56 → 1777.34] And I do understand for some people,
[1777.90 → 1782.22] the whole live service concept where they're constantly changing up the game
[1782.22 → 1783.46] to keep you playing it forever,
[1783.70 → 1784.80] like something like a Fortnite,
[1785.26 → 1786.56] that totally works for them.
[1786.56 → 1796.24] I mean, we had a really cool competitive Fortnite player in here the other day,
[1796.54 → 1797.00] Kanaka.
[1797.86 → 1798.58] Do you know this guy?
[1800.32 → 1802.12] I recognize the name, I think.
[1802.76 → 1803.66] Yeah, this guy.
[1803.82 → 1804.12] Yes.
[1804.42 → 1804.86] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1804.92 → 1808.48] Yeah, we had this guy in for a collab last week,
[1809.06 → 1812.20] and he said, he figures,
[1812.20 → 1815.78] I hate that maybe this is right,
[1815.78 → 1817.52] but it seems like it can't be right.
[1817.62 → 1818.56] He says he figures,
[1819.04 → 1824.50] I think he said Epic Game Store rolls over after 10,000 hours or something like that.
[1824.74 → 1829.08] So he figures he has like 40,000 hours in Fortnite.
[1829.22 → 1831.14] He's like in his early 20s.
[1831.92 → 1837.54] So like a significant amount of his waking life is like playing Fortnite.
[1837.54 → 1839.44] But you,
[1839.58 → 1840.80] dude,
[1841.04 → 1842.10] like I've watched him play,
[1842.22 → 1843.16] I can't even,
[1843.16 → 1847.10] I can't even track what he's doing.
[1847.22 → 1847.42] Yeah.
[1847.72 → 1848.00] Like,
[1848.22 → 1848.84] what do you call it,
[1848.88 → 1850.24] busting 90s or whatever,
[1850.40 → 1853.70] where he like builds a tower in 90 degree things,
[1853.80 → 1855.52] and makes a spiral staircase as he goes up,
[1855.54 → 1855.80] and he just,
[1856.06 → 1858.64] he does it so fast that I can't even like,
[1859.28 → 1862.08] tell how many levels up he is by the time,
[1862.08 → 1862.54] I'm just,
[1862.54 → 1862.94] I'm just,
[1863.72 → 1864.38] okay,
[1864.52 → 1866.14] you just hit me with the okay boomer now,
[1866.24 → 1869.10] because I do not know what's going on right now.
[1869.28 → 1870.20] Cranking 90s.
[1870.26 → 1871.10] Thank you.
[1871.34 → 1871.68] Uh,
[1871.94 → 1872.28] LPGA,
[1873.08 → 1873.50] Luca,
[1873.70 → 1874.64] Luca 103,
[1875.14 → 1876.54] busting 90s,
[1876.64 → 1877.14] dying.
[1878.94 → 1880.24] There's your okay boomer moment.
[1880.34 → 1880.50] Yeah.
[1880.58 → 1881.36] So he's good.
[1881.44 → 1881.94] I think he,
[1882.04 → 1885.26] he recorded a short while he was here of trying to teach me to do it.
[1885.40 → 1886.40] It's pathetic.
[1888.04 → 1888.78] Cause there's like,
[1888.78 → 1891.58] there's like three different hotkeys that are all like,
[1891.58 → 1893.06] down at the bottom,
[1893.06 → 1897.08] like Z XC or XC V or something like that for your flat,
[1897.22 → 1898.66] your stairs and your wall.
[1898.66 → 1899.46] And I'm just like,
[1899.52 → 1899.84] what?
[1900.32 → 1902.20] I got no idea what's going on,
[1902.24 → 1902.46] man.
[1902.80 → 1904.24] Love busting 90s.
[1904.32 → 1905.20] Stop it.
[1905.96 → 1906.72] Stop it.
[1907.42 → 1908.38] Straight busting.
[1908.96 → 1909.60] So there,
[1909.70 → 1910.08] there are,
[1910.20 → 1910.50] by the way,
[1910.56 → 1912.86] there are examples of open world games,
[1912.98 → 1914.32] arguably from the eighties,
[1914.44 → 1918.00] definitely from the nineties and for sure Z's from the early two thousands,
[1918.00 → 1918.94] which is all right.
[1919.30 → 1920.46] 25 years ago.
[1920.46 → 1922.60] And I have loved me some open world games.
[1922.72 → 1925.04] I love Legend of Zelda breath of the wild.
[1925.28 → 1926.72] I think it's freaking awesome.
[1927.38 → 1930.10] Oblivion was quite open world.
[1930.22 → 1930.68] I remember.
[1930.82 → 1932.46] Even Oblivion is like old.
[1933.44 → 1933.76] Stop.
[1934.04 → 1934.32] It's not.
[1934.32 → 1935.20] Like very old.
[1935.22 → 1935.98] It's really not that old.
[1936.08 → 1936.96] It's ancient.
[1936.96 → 1937.92] It's really not that old.
[1938.78 → 1939.32] Horse armour,
[1939.48 → 1939.88] quality,
[1940.04 → 1942.58] modern mechanic where you can pay extra for cosmetics.
[1942.90 → 1945.26] In not that many days.
[1945.26 → 1945.50] Stop.
[1945.70 → 1947.24] It will be 20 years old.
[1947.24 → 1948.26] I can mute him there.
[1948.32 → 1948.70] He's muted.
[1949.04 → 1950.22] I don't have to hear it now.
[1950.58 → 1950.76] Wait,
[1950.80 → 1951.96] I can still hear the monitoring.
[1952.30 → 1952.60] No,
[1952.68 → 1953.08] this sucks.
[1953.18 → 1953.26] No,
[1953.32 → 1953.60] you're off.
[1953.64 → 1953.86] Oh wait,
[1953.94 → 1954.70] you can still hear.
[1954.78 → 1954.96] Yeah,
[1955.04 → 1955.24] I can,
[1955.24 → 1956.06] I can still,
[1956.18 → 1957.28] I can still hear him.
[1957.32 → 1957.86] This sucks.
[1958.04 → 1958.32] Hello.
[1959.00 → 1959.18] Oh,
[1959.26 → 1959.44] wow.
[1959.50 → 1959.78] I can't.
[1959.82 → 1959.94] Oh,
[1960.08 → 1961.24] Dan can turn you off.
[1961.86 → 1962.26] Yes.
[1962.34 → 1963.34] That's so rude.
[1963.54 → 1963.90] Dan,
[1964.06 → 1965.38] you're the best.
[1965.38 → 1965.78] louder.
[1966.12 → 1966.68] He's the best.
[1966.68 → 1967.38] This man,
[1967.98 → 1968.20] this,
[1968.64 → 1968.98] hold on.
[1969.06 → 1969.52] I'm going to try to,
[1970.12 → 1973.14] I'm trying to point it,
[1973.24 → 1973.38] Dan.
[1973.44 → 1973.92] It's hard.
[1974.02 → 1974.50] You do it.
[1975.38 → 1977.02] This man with both hands.
[1977.08 → 1978.06] Try and do it with both hands.
[1978.70 → 1978.96] Okay.
[1979.00 → 1979.98] You're cheating though.
[1980.04 → 1980.38] How?
[1981.14 → 1984.28] You're cheating because you saw me do it first.
[1986.08 → 1986.48] Okay.
[1986.48 → 1987.38] I do need to hear him though,
[1987.40 → 1987.58] Dan.
[1988.66 → 1989.06] Okay.
[1990.74 → 1991.36] All right.
[1991.40 → 1992.12] I'm back.
[1992.38 → 1993.20] I'm back.
[1993.88 → 1994.66] Back again.
[1994.76 → 1994.98] But yeah,
[1994.98 → 1995.26] anyway,
[1995.38 → 1995.70] what other,
[1995.72 → 1997.60] what other mechanics?
[1997.84 → 1997.98] Sorry.
[1998.62 → 1998.92] Oh,
[1998.96 → 2000.80] it was open world and live service.
[2003.02 → 2004.92] Could you say an MMO is live service?
[2005.00 → 2005.60] Cause if then,
[2005.74 → 2009.66] then when is Ultima from some online?
[2010.00 → 2010.52] 1996.
[2012.62 → 2013.10] 1997.
[2014.12 → 2015.12] But you were very close,
[2015.12 → 2015.70] but like,
[2015.78 → 2016.02] yeah,
[2016.02 → 2016.58] it's not,
[2016.70 → 2017.90] it's not a new model.
[2019.40 → 2024.12] I would say live services much more popularized these days.
[2024.12 → 2028.12] And it's happening for things that aren't basically just MMORPGs,
[2028.34 → 2029.86] which is pretty much all it was for a while.
[2029.94 → 2031.12] So that one I think is more.
[2031.12 → 2032.76] I think that's your okay boomer moment.
[2032.86 → 2035.40] When's the last time anyone called it an MMORPG?
[2035.40 → 2036.40] That is awesome.
[2036.40 → 2037.00] That is awesome.
[2040.14 → 2043.62] Can you tell I haven't had a desktop for three months?
[2045.36 → 2046.82] I saw it set up.
[2046.94 → 2047.80] You got it now.
[2047.84 → 2049.42] There's no cables or anything.
[2049.62 → 2049.78] Oh,
[2049.84 → 2051.08] that explains why it looked so good.
[2051.26 → 2051.88] There's no mouse.
[2052.34 → 2053.56] There's nothing going on.
[2053.56 → 2058.28] It's just the desktop and three monitors on a desk with nothing else.
[2060.86 → 2061.56] And again,
[2061.64 → 2062.10] if you like,
[2062.20 → 2063.18] if I did a 360,
[2063.46 → 2064.08] it's a.
[2064.48 → 2065.88] You mean busted three,
[2066.02 → 2066.14] nine,
[2066.26 → 2066.86] four nineties,
[2067.02 → 2067.88] four nineties.
[2072.78 → 2073.18] Yeah.
[2073.24 → 2073.44] Okay.
[2073.46 → 2074.32] The live service one,
[2074.40 → 2074.66] I'll,
[2074.66 → 2075.10] I'll give them.
[2075.16 → 2075.52] Because I,
[2075.64 → 2075.98] you know,
[2076.02 → 2078.92] I think they're describing something that is different from Ultima online,
[2078.98 → 2080.06] but the open world thing,
[2080.06 → 2081.94] I don't necessarily agree with open worlds,
[2082.16 → 2082.68] uh,
[2082.74 → 2083.28] an old,
[2083.46 → 2084.84] it's an old thing.
[2085.98 → 2089.34] I do think we strayed away from it for a while.
[2089.36 → 2092.12] I think it was actually more popular even longer ago.
[2092.28 → 2097.92] And then there was like a while there were very linear games.
[2097.92 → 2099.60] Games were like the trend,
[2099.70 → 2102.62] but open world games existed before that happened.
[2102.70 → 2105.80] And then just became re popular again after that.
[2106.14 → 2107.24] So I don't know.
[2107.62 → 2108.04] Anyway,
[2108.08 → 2109.22] what was the actual question?
[2109.22 → 2111.46] What are your thoughts on where gaming trends are going?
[2111.72 → 2112.54] Generally bad.
[2112.66 → 2113.70] Let's move on to the next one.
[2114.86 → 2115.70] I don't agree.
[2116.32 → 2119.34] And I'm going to plug some float plane here for a second.
[2119.60 → 2124.10] I made a video a while ago talking about this concept, and we're going to talk about this
[2124.10 → 2124.28] later,
[2124.38 → 2126.12] but I'm doing another Luke week thing.
[2126.68 → 2127.12] Um,
[2127.16 → 2130.64] and I retouch on this concept and I actually don't agree.
[2130.74 → 2132.68] The core premise of my argument here,
[2132.74 → 2137.06] which I have kind of talked about on WAN show before is we're in a weird period,
[2137.06 → 2137.98] but it's,
[2138.04 → 2138.90] it's cyclical.
[2138.90 → 2141.30] And we have been in this weird period before.
[2141.54 → 2142.28] And the
[2142.28 → 2145.00] the last time that we were in this weird period was a month ago,
[2145.00 → 2145.76] was the
[2145.76 → 2149.22] the end of the age of companies like Atari.
[2149.76 → 2150.52] Give it to me,
[2150.56 → 2150.78] Dan.
[2151.10 → 2152.18] And when,
[2152.44 → 2152.88] yeah,
[2152.88 → 2153.40] there it is.
[2153.96 → 2154.36] Yeah.
[2154.36 → 2156.88] And when Atari kind of died,
[2157.00 → 2157.68] if I remember correctly,
[2157.76 → 2161.80] they like one of the companies that spawned off of Atari slowly dying,
[2161.80 → 2162.76] um,
[2162.82 → 2164.08] was Activision,
[2164.14 → 2164.54] I think.
[2165.54 → 2166.26] Never heard of it.
[2166.26 → 2169.42] So they were like small and scrappy and made really amazing things.
[2169.42 → 2169.80] And then,
[2169.80 → 2170.28] you know,
[2170.28 → 2173.86] they got big, and now they're kind of starting to fall apart.
[2173.86 → 2176.72] And some of the splinters of that are creating cool things.
[2177.18 → 2177.62] And,
[2177.62 → 2178.48] uh,
[2178.78 → 2179.42] the
[2179.42 → 2184.54] the feature of this more recent one is talking about a splinter company from
[2184.54 → 2185.02] dice.
[2185.14 → 2186.68] A bunch of people who used to work for dice,
[2186.68 → 2188.12] a legendary,
[2188.36 → 2189.94] extremely prolific gaming studio.
[2189.94 → 2191.72] Who's made crazy things over time.
[2191.72 → 2195.42] Never heard of them is kind of big and maybe a little slow.
[2195.42 → 2197.36] Now has people splintering off,
[2197.36 → 2198.00] um,
[2198.00 → 2199.48] in an interview in,
[2199.70 → 2200.06] um,
[2200.56 → 2202.70] one of the making of our graders videos.
[2202.88 → 2203.36] Uh,
[2203.36 → 2205.16] the CEO talks about like,
[2205.48 → 2205.66] yeah,
[2205.66 → 2208.90] I've run massive companies, and they can make neat,
[2208.90 → 2210.16] high fidelity games,
[2210.16 → 2211.78] but are they good games?
[2212.54 → 2213.34] I don't know.
[2213.62 → 2215.62] I think we can make good games here,
[2215.70 → 2216.24] which is like,
[2216.28 → 2216.44] yeah,
[2216.46 → 2216.96] let's go.
[2217.42 → 2217.86] Um,
[2217.98 → 2218.90] and yeah,
[2218.90 → 2219.48] I think this is,
[2219.56 → 2222.96] this is happening more and more, and you're seeing like the games that
[2222.96 → 2225.18] people are talking about these days are like,
[2225.26 → 2225.62] Oh my God,
[2225.64 → 2228.90] everyone's all excited because divinity was announced from the people who
[2228.90 → 2230.58] made bothers gate three layering studios.
[2230.70 → 2231.14] They,
[2231.28 → 2231.44] the
[2231.44 → 2234.68] the games people are talking about the game awards were like expedition 33,
[2234.98 → 2235.76] arc Raiders,
[2235.76 → 2237.74] nine awards or something like that this year.
[2237.86 → 2238.18] Yeah.
[2238.18 → 2239.36] I think it was nine.
[2239.48 → 2241.28] Silk song is like a huge thing in the
[2241.34 → 2241.66] in the
[2241.66 → 2243.44] in the conversation right now.
[2243.48 → 2245.36] It's not those big old companies.
[2245.44 → 2249.46] Those big old companies are currently being looted of their good people and
[2249.46 → 2251.66] they're going to smaller companies, and they're making cool things.
[2251.82 → 2252.42] It's just,
[2252.50 → 2256.26] it's hard to look at the blizzards and Ubisoft's of the world and expect
[2256.26 → 2257.02] anything good right now.
[2257.06 → 2257.74] It's not really happening.
[2257.74 → 2261.18] But if you open your horizons to these new,
[2261.52 → 2262.26] newer companies,
[2262.26 → 2264.28] there is actually really cool games coming out.
[2264.46 → 2264.62] Uh,
[2264.62 → 2265.30] master of none.
[2265.50 → 2265.72] Yes,
[2265.74 → 2266.72] you were rage baited.
[2266.72 → 2268.70] I do know.
[2268.70 → 2269.38] Activision.
[2274.56 → 2274.96] Cool.
[2275.14 → 2276.68] Are we doing another one or is that good?
[2276.94 → 2277.10] Yeah,
[2277.14 → 2277.90] I got another one here.
[2278.00 → 2278.24] Okay.
[2278.30 → 2278.58] Hit us,
[2278.66 → 2278.80] Dan.
[2279.06 → 2279.42] Sure.
[2279.82 → 2280.22] Hello,
[2280.44 → 2280.98] LLD.
[2281.24 → 2283.22] Linus is a fellow EV driver.
[2283.32 → 2286.12] What are your thoughts on the increasing adoption of NEWS,
[2286.24 → 2289.12] the Tesla charging port over J one seven,
[2289.24 → 2289.40] seven,
[2289.52 → 2289.54] seven,
[2289.54 → 2290.94] two and CCS.
[2291.26 → 2291.72] Luke and Dan,
[2291.72 → 2294.38] what are your primary EV roadblocks?
[2294.60 → 2294.82] Uh,
[2294.82 → 2297.52] what are the primary EV roadblocks for you?
[2298.08 → 2301.52] I'm not an electrical engineer, and I'm not a mechanical engineer.
[2301.68 → 2311.60] So I would not consider myself qualified to determine which is the ideal plug shape and format for charging,
[2311.60 → 2312.00] uh,
[2312.00 → 2315.02] high voltage electric vehicle system.
[2315.02 → 2319.38] My thought though,
[2319.46 → 2324.26] and I do still have thoughts is why the fuck couldn't we settle this stuff ages ago?
[2324.26 → 2329.48] Because now I have the wrong connector on my car and I have to carry it around an adapter forever.
[2329.92 → 2337.60] But also I don't care because I charge literally every single time in my garage or at my building where I install the chargers.
[2337.60 → 2340.26] So I put the kind that's compatible with my car.
[2343.00 → 2343.60] Makes sense.
[2343.78 → 2345.16] That's where I'm kind of our on that.
[2345.24 → 2346.58] But if I was ever on a road trip,
[2346.64 → 2346.74] yeah,
[2346.74 → 2347.92] I'd have to carry it around an adapter,
[2348.30 → 2350.28] but Yvonne's car came with a free adapter.
[2350.44 → 2353.74] So I would steal hers because I assume I'm not going anywhere without my wife.
[2354.30 → 2354.62] Um,
[2354.68 → 2355.28] so I guess,
[2355.34 → 2355.42] yeah,
[2355.44 → 2356.62] it's not really a problem for me.
[2356.70 → 2360.48] I just wish that we had settled all of this a little bit earlier.
[2360.48 → 2362.32] So we didn't have these competing standards,
[2362.32 → 2364.72] but that's the way it always goes,
[2364.72 → 2379.46] whether it's VHS and beta or whether it's HD DVD and Blu-ray or whether it's USB-C and all the other garbage that existed that USB-C thankfully has completely replaced.
[2379.96 → 2380.26] Um,
[2380.26 → 2381.66] not that USB-C is perfect,
[2381.66 → 2382.38] but still,
[2382.38 → 2383.50] um,
[2383.68 → 2384.06] it's just,
[2384.12 → 2385.30] it's just the way it is.
[2385.42 → 2385.66] You know,
[2385.68 → 2388.78] it's the XKCD standards comic strip,
[2388.86 → 2389.04] right?
[2389.04 → 2390.74] There's always going to be someone who goes,
[2390.86 → 2390.98] oh,
[2391.02 → 2391.98] we have too many standards.
[2392.08 → 2393.18] We should try and make just one.
[2393.42 → 2394.38] Let's make a new standard,
[2394.46 → 2394.64] right?
[2394.72 → 2399.36] And so the fact that we are consolidating on something I think is really positive.
[2399.60 → 2400.66] If it's the Tesla connector,
[2400.66 → 2402.52] then great.
[2403.64 → 2404.08] Yeah.
[2404.12 → 2404.52] For me,
[2404.58 → 2404.74] the
[2404.82 → 2406.98] the block for an electric vehicle,
[2407.12 → 2407.38] one,
[2407.54 → 2408.96] somebody already pointed out in chat,
[2409.08 → 2409.50] uh,
[2409.50 → 2410.72] I would have to buy it.
[2410.80 → 2411.92] My car is great.
[2412.02 → 2412.60] Why would I,
[2412.78 → 2415.92] why would I spend a ton of money replacing something that is perfect?
[2416.02 → 2417.58] I have no interest in doing that.
[2417.78 → 2418.14] Uh,
[2418.14 → 2422.26] and then the other one is that there is actually a somewhat real blocker outside of that,
[2422.26 → 2422.88] uh,
[2422.88 → 2424.20] which is I live in a condo.
[2424.20 → 2424.64] The
[2424.64 → 2430.54] the power delivery in my condo only comes from the little,
[2430.54 → 2432.16] whatever you want to call them garages.
[2432.16 → 2432.78] I wouldn't,
[2432.92 → 2434.46] I don't know if I'd really want to call it a garage,
[2434.62 → 2436.62] but storage space that you have.
[2436.80 → 2436.86] Yeah.
[2436.90 → 2437.32] The storage,
[2437.58 → 2442.64] which means it's only on the perimeter and every unit only has one parking spot.
[2442.64 → 2443.46] That's on the perimeter.
[2443.92 → 2445.58] So I would have to somehow buy,
[2445.74 → 2446.70] which is possible,
[2446.70 → 2448.80] but not always possible.
[2448.80 → 2451.64] I'd have to somehow buy a parking spot from somebody else.
[2451.64 → 2451.82] Right.
[2451.90 → 2453.08] And the part that he,
[2453.32 → 2455.92] the information he hasn't given you is that,
[2455.92 → 2456.32] uh,
[2456.32 → 2457.06] in his household,
[2457.06 → 2458.00] there is already.
[2458.20 → 2458.52] Yes.
[2459.04 → 2459.26] Yeah.
[2459.38 → 2463.50] A plug-in hybrid that uses the one spot they have that's on the perimeter.
[2463.66 → 2465.34] Which just sounds kind of annoying.
[2465.56 → 2466.60] Key piece of information.
[2466.88 → 2467.42] I would,
[2467.58 → 2468.64] if I,
[2468.64 → 2469.66] if I got something,
[2469.76 → 2471.30] a plug-in hybrid would be okay.
[2471.44 → 2475.12] Cause then I could charge elsewhere and then still use the gas.
[2475.64 → 2476.12] Um,
[2476.56 → 2481.72] I have had the thought that if like Acura released a TL that was a plug-in hybrid,
[2481.72 → 2485.20] I would wait a couple of years and then potentially look into a used one.
[2485.34 → 2487.24] You also just don't drive that much.
[2487.52 → 2487.96] Correct.
[2489.32 → 2492.22] It's like not a huge deal.
[2493.34 → 2493.82] Yeah.
[2498.64 → 2499.48] No,
[2499.54 → 2500.04] we can move on.
[2500.84 → 2502.66] I just thought I'd bring up Dan for a second.
[2502.78 → 2502.94] Okay.
[2503.00 → 2503.82] I'll archive it.
[2505.48 → 2506.38] Who's going to archive it?
[2506.38 → 2508.34] Cause if we both archive it at the same time,
[2508.42 → 2510.40] we're going to accidentally archive too.
[2510.58 → 2511.74] Let me archive them.
[2511.74 → 2511.92] No,
[2511.96 → 2512.68] I want to archive it.
[2512.72 → 2512.92] Okay.
[2512.92 → 2513.56] You archive it.
[2513.58 → 2514.66] You can archive this one.
[2514.74 → 2514.90] No,
[2514.96 → 2515.38] you do it.
[2516.96 → 2517.28] No,
[2517.32 → 2517.62] I'll do it.
[2517.62 → 2517.82] No,
[2517.90 → 2518.08] don't.
[2518.76 → 2519.60] You already did it.
[2522.00 → 2522.56] All right.
[2522.60 → 2523.94] Why don't we pick another topic?
[2525.20 → 2528.62] Australia's social media ban for under 16.
[2528.64 → 2531.34] has gone into effect.
[2531.68 → 2532.74] On Wednesday,
[2532.98 → 2533.64] December 10th,
[2534.52 → 2545.04] Australia became the first country and entire continent to stop users under the age of 16 from accessing social media.
[2545.04 → 2552.18] The list of social mediae that are blocked or not permitted includes Facebook,
[2552.62 → 2553.06] Instagram,
[2553.66 → 2554.02] kick,
[2554.50 → 2554.78] Reddit,
[2555.00 → 2555.36] Snapchat,
[2555.62 → 2555.92] threads,
[2556.06 → 2556.30] TikTok,
[2556.50 → 2556.76] Twitch,
[2557.12 → 2557.74] Twitter,
[2557.96 → 2558.92] and YouTube.
[2558.92 → 2561.88] It is worth noting that,
[2561.88 → 2562.54] um,
[2563.10 → 2564.42] some platforms,
[2565.02 → 2566.36] notably Reddit,
[2567.46 → 2568.00] YouTube,
[2568.52 → 2568.82] and,
[2569.22 → 2570.80] no,
[2571.14 → 2573.62] Twitch was on the list of ones that are blocked.
[2574.50 → 2575.02] Uh,
[2575.02 → 2576.04] I think it was Discord.
[2576.04 → 2578.22] I think it's supposed to say Discord here.
[2578.72 → 2583.14] And Discord can still be accessed.
[2583.92 → 2584.46] But,
[2585.60 → 2591.32] users visiting the site will not be able to sign in or create an account.
[2591.32 → 2594.32] The bill is framed as...
[2594.32 → 2596.82] The female audience in Flipping Chat says Tumblr is still allowed,
[2596.94 → 2600.04] which is actually surprising to me.
[2600.54 → 2601.02] What?
[2602.28 → 2603.98] That seems strange.
[2603.98 → 2605.82] Is there,
[2605.82 → 2606.06] like,
[2606.10 → 2608.72] a user limit thing, and they just don't have enough people?
[2609.60 → 2610.00] Um,
[2610.72 → 2611.18] sorry,
[2611.28 → 2611.80] user limit?
[2611.94 → 2612.20] Like,
[2612.28 → 2618.72] a lot of these laws really only will apply to services that have enough people going to it.
[2618.76 → 2618.94] No,
[2619.06 → 2621.68] Tumblr is big enough that I would imagine it would matter.
[2621.68 → 2622.00] Is it still?
[2622.22 → 2625.68] And it's clearly not a user question because Reddit's allowed.
[2625.84 → 2625.94] Like,
[2625.98 → 2627.30] Reddit's got plenty of users.
[2628.12 → 2628.42] Uh,
[2628.88 → 2629.94] Hydrock says,
[2630.00 → 2630.84] what about Patreon?
[2631.70 → 2632.02] Oh,
[2632.06 → 2632.84] there's a lot more.
[2632.92 → 2633.20] Oh,
[2633.28 → 2633.70] wow.
[2633.98 → 2636.10] There was a strong resurgence among Gen Z.
[2636.22 → 2636.98] I didn't know that happened.
[2637.00 → 2637.12] Yeah,
[2637.16 → 2637.30] no,
[2637.34 → 2638.86] Tumblr's been more of a thing again,
[2638.94 → 2640.20] which is pretty wild.
[2640.42 → 2640.90] Very interesting.
[2641.14 → 2641.36] Yeah.
[2641.86 → 2642.26] Um,
[2642.48 → 2645.30] the life cycle of trends is...
[2645.30 → 2645.54] Yeah.
[2645.76 → 2650.20] ...so fast that they might as well just never be trendy at this point.
[2650.28 → 2650.42] Like,
[2650.42 → 2651.64] I'm sort of blown away.
[2652.06 → 2652.24] Like,
[2652.30 → 2655.92] when is Slashdot going to make a triumphant return along with Dig?
[2656.02 → 2656.18] Wait,
[2656.18 → 2656.30] wait,
[2656.36 → 2656.90] didn't Dig?
[2657.30 → 2658.02] Dig is working on it.
[2658.02 → 2659.34] Aren't they working on a relaunch?
[2659.44 → 2660.04] I still haven't actually,
[2660.12 → 2660.84] I got an invitation.
[2660.94 → 2661.62] I still haven't actually,
[2661.62 → 2661.86] like,
[2661.94 → 2662.46] accepted it.
[2662.46 → 2662.64] Okay.
[2663.36 → 2663.80] Anyway,
[2664.08 → 2666.52] the bill is framed as protecting children,
[2666.88 → 2668.76] and Australia's e-safety commissioner,
[2668.96 → 2670.14] Julie Inman Grant,
[2670.24 → 2672.76] has stated that if any teenagers have not been booted off yet,
[2673.16 → 2675.96] they will be in the coming weeks or months.
[2676.24 → 2676.64] Okay.
[2676.64 → 2681.26] This is because some of these companies were a bit slower to communicate to their user base
[2681.26 → 2685.60] about the upcoming change and might not have had the systems fully deployed.
[2686.22 → 2690.34] Communications Minister Annika Wells boasts proudly with this law, stating,
[2690.34 → 2691.84] Not that long ago,
[2692.04 → 2696.74] auto manufacturers told us that making compulsory seatbelts would break their business model.
[2697.08 → 2698.02] It couldn't be done.
[2698.58 → 2698.96] Now,
[2699.12 → 2702.12] families choose cars based on who offers the safest features.
[2702.90 → 2704.34] Big tech could compete,
[2704.54 → 2705.26] like airlines,
[2705.40 → 2706.38] like auto manufacturers,
[2706.60 → 2708.96] to have the best safety record to offer their users,
[2709.22 → 2714.86] and that future is a little closer today because of this world-leading law.
[2715.32 → 2715.58] Dan,
[2715.64 → 2717.06] what was that noise you were making earlier?
[2717.06 → 2717.98] Yeah,
[2718.98 → 2719.94] that's the one.
[2720.72 → 2728.26] Julie Inman Grant has also stated that more sites could be added to this ban in the future,
[2728.26 → 2732.80] as several youths under 16 have already migrated towards different social media platforms.
[2733.26 → 2733.64] Wow,
[2733.74 → 2739.54] it's almost like the kids who have all the time in the world to go and find another platform
[2739.54 → 2746.58] are always going to be a step ahead of the boomers who are sitting there dragging their,
[2747.06 → 2747.88] having their,
[2747.88 → 2749.10] stick in the mud sticks,
[2749.26 → 2749.94] work-life balance,
[2749.94 → 2750.28] through the
[2750.36 → 2750.52] yeah,
[2750.64 → 2750.82] their,
[2751.14 → 2752.34] what are they,
[2752.66 → 2753.74] work governance balance,
[2753.76 → 2755.54] their bustin' 90s,
[2755.62 → 2756.10] trying to,
[2756.10 → 2758.16] I've heard,
[2758.24 → 2759.24] I've heard based on some,
[2759.24 → 2760.12] keep up with the kids,
[2760.36 → 2762.26] some observations that I've had,
[2762.32 → 2763.88] that work governance balance is like,
[2763.90 → 2764.72] you maybe do it like,
[2764.78 → 2765.04] I don't know,
[2765.08 → 2766.18] four or five days a year or something.
[2766.78 → 2767.24] It's interesting.
[2768.04 → 2768.74] Work of what now?
[2769.12 → 2769.98] Don't worry about it.
[2770.40 → 2772.38] Some youth are challenging the ban,
[2772.50 → 2772.82] saying,
[2773.38 → 2777.22] parental supervision of online activity is today the paramount parental responsibility.
[2777.70 → 2782.68] We do not want to outsource that responsibility to government and unelected bureaucrats.
[2783.08 → 2786.98] This ban is a direct assault on young people's right to freedom of political communication.
[2787.56 → 2789.14] According to YouGov and their survey,
[2789.28 → 2791.60] 77% of Australians were in support of the ban,
[2791.68 → 2793.62] which is up from 61% back in August.
[2793.62 → 2794.84] On Twitter,
[2794.96 → 2798.62] several people noticed the irony of claiming this ban is protecting children
[2798.62 → 2802.34] when two social media applications were excluded from the ban,
[2802.80 → 2804.18] Discord and Roblox,
[2804.32 → 2810.68] that are both notorious for being an unsafe environment for underage youth.
[2810.76 → 2811.12] Yeah, really.
[2812.26 → 2812.70] Alright,
[2813.24 → 2814.38] a lot to unpack here.
[2814.84 → 2816.02] Number one is,
[2816.94 → 2818.04] this ain't going to work.
[2819.22 → 2819.66] Overall,
[2820.06 → 2822.88] I'm not entirely unsupportive
[2822.88 → 2826.24] of limiting youth access to social media.
[2826.34 → 2831.80] I think it's been pretty well studied and well demonstrated to be harmful to developing brains.
[2831.98 → 2835.30] There were a few discussions that propped up on the Reddit of like,
[2835.38 → 2835.88] oh my god,
[2835.92 → 2837.38] what does this mean for Flow plane?
[2837.80 → 2839.98] Minimum age in Australia to get a credit card is 18.
[2840.64 → 2840.88] So,
[2841.12 → 2841.40] nothing.
[2841.66 → 2842.20] Sounds good.
[2842.34 → 2842.50] Yep,
[2842.82 → 2843.20] we'll be fine.
[2843.26 → 2843.72] We're chilling.
[2844.04 → 2845.64] We will do a total of nothing.
[2845.84 → 2851.32] But what's very clear is that this just isn't going to work.
[2851.32 → 2852.72] Oh yeah,
[2852.80 → 2853.38] not at all.
[2853.50 → 2854.36] Not even a little bit.
[2855.30 → 2856.04] Who cares?
[2857.48 → 2862.16] I think this will barely phase anyone under 16 in Australia at all.
[2862.58 → 2864.32] They'll just use something slightly different,
[2864.44 → 2866.20] or they'll VPN to it if they really care.
[2866.32 → 2866.44] Well,
[2866.46 → 2867.66] it's kind of like how when you,
[2867.78 → 2869.94] like when you travel to different places,
[2870.16 → 2870.82] there's just like,
[2870.88 → 2874.72] there's a different suite of apps that people tend to use.
[2874.72 → 2875.50] Like you go to Taiwan,
[2875.70 → 2877.92] everyone uses Line for messaging.
[2878.20 → 2878.38] Yep.
[2878.52 → 2878.82] You know,
[2878.84 → 2884.28] or you go to America and everyone uses iMessage because installing an app is too complicated.
[2885.02 → 2885.64] You know,
[2885.66 → 2886.14] or whatever.
[2886.86 → 2887.50] Like there's,
[2888.50 → 2895.20] what is it with you and like the sick burns on America?
[2895.20 → 2896.88] I don't get it.
[2899.22 → 2900.22] They swung first.
[2900.36 → 2900.72] I don't know.
[2902.84 → 2903.70] This one is.
[2905.32 → 2906.00] They're big.
[2906.08 → 2906.64] They can dig it.
[2907.20 → 2907.72] They'll be all right.
[2907.84 → 2908.20] Anyway,
[2908.30 → 2909.98] the point is just that it's,
[2910.04 → 2910.46] it's,
[2910.52 → 2914.20] it's clear that they're just going to find a different way to network.
[2914.52 → 2914.76] And,
[2914.90 → 2915.58] you know,
[2915.64 → 2916.22] at the
[2916.28 → 2918.10] at the very most basic level,
[2918.10 → 2922.78] it's not like they aren't still going to have text messaging and group chats,
[2922.78 → 2927.32] which functionally speaking is sure without the algorithmic portion,
[2927.68 → 2930.66] a lot of what anybody is doing on social media.
[2931.36 → 2931.80] Anyway,
[2931.92 → 2932.86] they're sharing pictures.
[2933.08 → 2934.10] They're sharing memes.
[2934.26 → 2935.94] They're sending messages to each other.
[2936.00 → 2936.92] They're bullying each other,
[2937.00 → 2937.34] you know,
[2937.50 → 2938.10] kid stuff.
[2939.88 → 2941.82] So our discussion questions are,
[2943.28 → 2946.94] would you help your kids around this law?
[2946.94 → 2948.76] If it was implemented today in Canada?
[2949.36 → 2949.60] No,
[2949.66 → 2950.60] I wouldn't, actually.
[2950.60 → 2951.90] Um,
[2952.14 → 2952.64] in fact,
[2952.70 → 2955.48] my kids are already banned from,
[2955.68 → 2955.84] let me,
[2955.92 → 2956.54] let me see, actually.
[2956.62 → 2956.82] What are,
[2956.90 → 2957.62] what are all these platforms?
[2958.62 → 2959.02] Uh,
[2959.26 → 2959.66] Facebook?
[2959.90 → 2960.20] Yes.
[2960.34 → 2960.72] Instagram?
[2961.04 → 2961.40] Banned.
[2961.52 → 2961.76] Kick?
[2962.04 → 2962.46] Banned.
[2962.62 → 2962.86] Reddit?
[2963.20 → 2963.50] Banned.
[2963.64 → 2963.96] Snapchat?
[2964.20 → 2964.52] Banned.
[2964.60 → 2965.00] Threads?
[2965.04 → 2965.30] Banned.
[2965.44 → 2965.68] TikTok?
[2965.88 → 2966.20] Banned.
[2966.30 → 2966.54] Twitch?
[2966.88 → 2967.30] Banned.
[2967.82 → 2968.26] Twitter?
[2968.82 → 2969.26] Banned.
[2969.46 → 2969.78] YouTube?
[2969.96 → 2971.10] They are allowed to use.
[2971.88 → 2973.28] Has there been any?
[2973.52 → 2973.80] Oh wait,
[2973.88 → 2974.00] no,
[2974.06 → 2974.30] YouTube,
[2974.42 → 2974.58] sorry,
[2974.66 → 2975.68] YouTube wasn't a banned one,
[2975.76 → 2975.98] I think.
[2976.16 → 2976.96] Was YouTube banned?
[2977.26 → 2977.88] I don't think so.
[2978.44 → 2980.10] I think our list is a little bit broken.
[2980.10 → 2982.08] I think our list is a little bit messed up.
[2982.14 → 2983.26] Don't worry about our list too much.
[2983.34 → 2985.28] We've already had a bunch of people in chat.
[2985.44 → 2985.64] Yeah.
[2985.72 → 2987.36] Talk about how things are different to the list.
[2987.50 → 2987.68] Yeah,
[2987.68 → 2988.22] sorry guys.
[2988.28 → 2988.40] No,
[2988.46 → 2989.52] because Reddit's in both of them.
[2989.62 → 2990.66] YouTube's in both of them.
[2990.84 → 2991.76] Just ignore the list.
[2991.76 → 2992.06] Dang it guys.
[2992.26 → 2992.46] Ugh,
[2992.64 → 2992.92] anyway.
[2993.08 → 2994.04] Completely ignore the list.
[2994.22 → 2994.58] Uh,
[2994.74 → 2994.98] anyway,
[2995.06 → 2995.68] the point is,
[2995.76 → 2995.86] yeah,
[2995.90 → 2997.48] my kids are not banned from YouTube,
[2997.48 → 2999.72] but they are banned from everything else that I just said.
[2999.78 → 3001.20] They are not banned from Discord,
[3001.20 → 3002.88] but I do,
[3003.08 → 3004.48] with their knowledge,
[3004.74 → 3011.26] keep an eye on what Discords they're in and who they're talking to because they are not allowed to talk to people on Discord that they do not know in real life.
[3011.92 → 3012.32] Um,
[3012.46 → 3013.82] and I think that's a
[3013.82 → 3014.56] that's a pretty,
[3014.74 → 3016.74] that's a pretty common sense,
[3016.74 → 3017.50] um,
[3017.50 → 3018.02] limit.
[3018.26 → 3020.20] Has there been any substantial,
[3021.06 → 3021.26] like,
[3021.28 → 3023.30] does that seem to bother them?
[3024.00 → 3024.22] Not,
[3024.28 → 3025.22] not the Discord thing,
[3025.22 → 3025.98] but like the
[3025.98 → 3027.22] the banning of the other platforms.
[3027.32 → 3028.44] Do they feel like they are,
[3028.44 → 3029.12] uh,
[3029.12 → 3031.22] not included socially in school?
[3031.52 → 3032.68] They're still pretty young.
[3032.98 → 3033.24] Yeah.
[3033.52 → 3033.92] Um,
[3034.26 → 3036.50] so I think that that's probably going to ratchet up.
[3037.64 → 3038.04] Not.
[3039.32 → 3039.80] His,
[3039.84 → 3040.02] uh,
[3040.02 → 3041.30] public name now is Randy.
[3041.90 → 3042.30] Randy.
[3042.56 → 3042.80] Okay.
[3043.00 → 3043.18] Yeah.
[3043.72 → 3047.72] Randy's at the age where that kind of stuff is becoming a thing for sure.
[3047.82 → 3047.98] Oh,
[3048.04 → 3048.44] definitely.
[3048.88 → 3049.52] And like,
[3049.54 → 3055.96] he has friends that literally will come to our house and while everyone else is like running around like hooligans,
[3055.96 → 3057.44] will be like,
[3057.46 → 3058.36] will be on their phone.
[3058.44 → 3059.60] And you know,
[3059.86 → 3060.52] like I,
[3060.78 → 3062.98] I'm not here to parent other people's kids.
[3062.98 → 3063.50] That is sad.
[3064.34 → 3064.78] Um,
[3065.50 → 3065.76] yeah.
[3065.90 → 3066.16] Uh,
[3066.16 → 3066.34] yeah.
[3066.34 → 3066.60] I'm not,
[3066.64 → 3068.04] I'm not here to parent other people's kids,
[3068.04 → 3069.96] so I'm not going to get involved in that.
[3070.16 → 3070.60] Right.
[3070.64 → 3071.32] But it's,
[3071.36 → 3072.90] it's definitely something that,
[3072.90 → 3073.42] you know,
[3073.42 → 3075.54] as parents of Randy,
[3075.74 → 3076.54] we notice.
[3077.24 → 3077.68] Sup.
[3079.02 → 3080.88] Someone in chat was like,
[3081.08 → 3082.84] would you let them sign up for World of Warcraft?
[3082.92 → 3083.80] And Dan just responded,
[3084.00 → 3084.56] Eve online.
[3085.28 → 3085.90] And it's like,
[3086.28 → 3087.70] you have to start them young.
[3087.70 → 3088.88] That'll teach you some things.
[3089.04 → 3090.30] I don't mind them getting into like,
[3090.30 → 3090.70] capitalism,
[3090.96 → 3091.16] baby.
[3091.48 → 3092.32] Spreadsheet mastery.
[3093.12 → 3093.56] Actually,
[3093.64 → 3094.80] you just watch movies mostly.
[3096.54 → 3096.98] Yeah.
[3097.38 → 3097.72] It's,
[3097.86 → 3098.46] uh,
[3098.60 → 3099.60] yeah.
[3099.60 → 3101.60] And we try to keep them really busy.
[3102.14 → 3102.50] Actually,
[3102.66 → 3103.12] oh man,
[3103.18 → 3105.00] this transitions pretty well into,
[3105.00 → 3105.82] uh,
[3105.92 → 3108.74] a pretty cool subject,
[3108.74 → 3109.34] uh,
[3109.36 → 3110.44] and into our next topic.
[3110.44 → 3110.86] Uh,
[3110.92 → 3111.06] or,
[3111.38 → 3111.46] okay,
[3111.50 → 3112.86] is there anything else we want to talk about here?
[3113.22 → 3113.98] I think we're fine.
[3114.12 → 3115.16] Via merch message,
[3115.32 → 3116.16] Elijah.
[3116.64 → 3116.86] Oh,
[3117.20 → 3120.84] Elijah's theory is that Roblox and Discord are exempt because it's algorithm based.
[3120.92 → 3123.32] They don't really have like an algorithm compared to like Facebook,
[3123.44 → 3123.64] Instagram,
[3123.64 → 3123.90] or Twitter.
[3123.98 → 3124.22] That's,
[3124.26 → 3125.18] that's an interesting theory.
[3126.06 → 3126.46] Um,
[3126.66 → 3127.02] okay.
[3127.60 → 3128.00] Okay.
[3128.48 → 3129.12] He might be right.
[3129.16 → 3129.64] He might be wrong.
[3130.10 → 3130.38] No,
[3130.54 → 3131.12] I am not,
[3131.12 → 3131.48] uh,
[3131.48 → 3133.14] trying to counter his statement to be clear.
[3133.24 → 3133.38] I'm,
[3133.38 → 3134.18] I'm wondering like,
[3134.30 → 3136.30] is that a good thing to base it off of?
[3136.84 → 3137.20] Um,
[3138.16 → 3141.76] all I can say for sure is that it's based on what?
[3141.84 → 3142.48] I don't know.
[3143.88 → 3144.28] Sure.
[3144.38 → 3145.38] It's based on something.
[3146.08 → 3146.94] It seems like,
[3146.98 → 3147.26] I mean,
[3147.26 → 3147.70] I don't know.
[3147.70 → 3150.90] That seems like a pretty good assumption based on the list that we have,
[3151.02 → 3152.16] but yeah.
[3152.30 → 3152.58] Okay.
[3152.58 → 3156.28] So speaking of my kids and being generally too busy to doom scroll,
[3156.38 → 3156.90] ticktock.
[3157.02 → 3157.52] Um,
[3158.18 → 3161.64] I think I told you that he had the entrepreneur fair coming up.
[3161.74 → 3161.96] Yes.
[3162.02 → 3162.46] And,
[3162.50 → 3162.76] uh,
[3162.76 → 3164.00] my son was,
[3164.20 → 3164.62] uh,
[3164.64 → 3168.56] has been 3d printing up an absolute storm.
[3168.68 → 3168.98] Yeah.
[3168.98 → 3169.48] I think,
[3169.54 → 3169.76] uh,
[3169.76 → 3171.54] I think we showed on the show last week,
[3171.54 → 3179.74] the picture of him surrounded by chaos in my mechanical room with 3d printers everywhere.
[3180.26 → 3180.66] Uh,
[3180.66 → 3181.54] does that sound familiar?
[3181.54 → 3181.96] Did we,
[3182.08 → 3182.64] did we do that?
[3183.04 → 3183.98] I think we did that.
[3184.04 → 3184.22] Okay,
[3184.30 → 3184.56] cool.
[3184.74 → 3184.88] Yeah.
[3185.06 → 3187.30] So the fruit of those labours,
[3187.46 → 3187.84] uh,
[3187.84 → 3188.10] Dan,
[3188.14 → 3189.34] I just sent that over to you.
[3189.52 → 3190.56] We do.
[3190.66 → 3191.96] We have an updated photo.
[3192.14 → 3192.88] Let's go dude.
[3193.88 → 3194.82] I messaged him.
[3194.88 → 3195.14] I went,
[3195.26 → 3195.48] Hey,
[3196.32 → 3196.80] Oh no.
[3196.80 → 3197.54] First he messaged me.
[3197.60 → 3197.74] He says,
[3197.84 → 3197.92] Hey,
[3197.94 → 3198.96] I left money on your desk,
[3198.96 → 3199.50] uh,
[3199.50 → 3199.92] for filament.
[3200.08 → 3200.42] Sorry,
[3200.48 → 3200.94] your nightstand.
[3201.30 → 3201.94] And I go,
[3202.26 → 3205.30] I heard you had a great hall at the entrepreneur fair.
[3205.98 → 3207.14] How much did you make?
[3207.20 → 3207.48] He goes,
[3207.62 → 3210.34] after expenses around $200.
[3210.34 → 3212.46] After expenses.
[3212.98 → 3213.28] Yeah.
[3213.40 → 3214.74] So he's already doing that calculation,
[3214.82 → 3215.40] which is sick.
[3215.52 → 3216.34] So he all,
[3216.48 → 3219.80] this is after he reimbursed me for filament by weight.
[3220.16 → 3220.76] Dang,
[3221.28 → 3221.66] dude.
[3222.32 → 3222.80] Yeah.
[3223.26 → 3223.64] That'll,
[3223.76 → 3224.48] that'll be addicting.
[3224.98 → 3226.80] Pretty freaking cool.
[3227.18 → 3227.70] Uh,
[3227.70 → 3228.20] I went,
[3228.40 → 3228.78] um,
[3228.78 → 3229.24] great job.
[3229.24 → 3230.70] Did you take a picture with your earnings?
[3230.82 → 3231.82] First big payday.
[3232.30 → 3233.98] And so he sent me this.
[3234.08 → 3235.82] That's a pretty good first big payday.
[3235.98 → 3236.22] Yeah.
[3236.30 → 3236.94] So he,
[3237.06 → 3237.44] um,
[3237.58 → 3239.96] so he actually did two projects.
[3240.36 → 3242.14] So instead of just doing one,
[3242.22 → 3244.12] he did the 3d printing thing with me.
[3244.20 → 3246.30] And then with Yvonne,
[3246.30 → 3249.44] he was working separately on snow cones.
[3250.34 → 3251.36] So he was like,
[3251.40 → 3251.56] okay,
[3251.58 → 3254.60] what's something that has like a relatively low input cost.
[3254.60 → 3255.58] Um,
[3255.60 → 3257.60] but that has like a pretty decent value.
[3257.60 → 3259.12] It's like consumable.
[3259.36 → 3259.84] Uh,
[3259.84 → 3263.04] he originally wanted to do like milkshakes or boba tea or something like that,
[3263.04 → 3264.16] but they were really complicated.
[3264.22 → 3266.40] And what he settled on was snow cones.
[3266.50 → 3267.32] They're super simple.
[3267.46 → 3272.02] You just get those like Mid squirt things at the grocery store.
[3272.12 → 3275.98] You add a little bit of additional colourant or dye.
[3276.20 → 3277.44] And then you,
[3277.54 → 3279.40] you just need like a bunch of,
[3279.56 → 3279.90] um,
[3279.96 → 3280.94] like just ice cubes.
[3280.94 → 3286.54] And then he rented a machine to turn the ice cubes into like snow.
[3286.54 → 3287.44] And it's like slush.
[3287.54 → 3289.22] And then you just squirt the thing on it.
[3289.30 → 3292.64] And so he absolutely cleaned up.
[3292.72 → 3297.12] I asked him how his friends did, and he didn't have numbers from everybody,
[3297.12 → 3299.48] but he did talk to one of his friends who was like,
[3299.48 → 3304.74] I think a hundred bucks revenue or something like that for what was actually a
[3304.74 → 3305.80] pretty cool idea too.
[3305.90 → 3306.60] But he just,
[3306.66 → 3307.32] man,
[3307.36 → 3309.42] he just cleaned up.
[3309.42 → 3309.94] up.
[3310.06 → 3313.16] You said parents weren't coming,
[3313.28 → 3313.42] right?
[3313.48 → 3316.00] So did parents like send the kids with cash?
[3316.12 → 3316.74] That's kind of cool.
[3316.90 → 3317.06] Yeah.
[3317.12 → 3320.08] So they have an entrepreneurship class and,
[3320.08 → 3320.82] um,
[3320.84 → 3321.96] that's awesome.
[3322.20 → 3322.38] Yeah.
[3322.76 → 3323.08] Like,
[3323.14 → 3326.42] and so you come up with a business idea and then they platform you,
[3326.54 → 3329.02] they give you two days in,
[3329.02 → 3329.32] uh,
[3329.32 → 3329.98] in December,
[3329.98 → 3331.24] um,
[3331.34 → 3331.66] about,
[3331.78 → 3333.78] I think it's a week or two apart or something like that.
[3333.78 → 3334.70] And then,
[3334.70 → 3335.36] uh,
[3335.42 → 3340.54] each of the classes in the school is given like 10 minutes to go through and the parents
[3340.54 → 3341.20] know about it.
[3341.20 → 3344.88] And so they'll come with a little bit of pocket money, and then they're allowed to,
[3344.92 → 3345.86] to buy stuff while they're there.
[3345.86 → 3346.34] So he,
[3346.46 → 3351.56] he sold through three quarters of all the like fidget toys and stuff that he made.
[3351.56 → 3352.84] And he sold,
[3353.02 → 3353.32] um,
[3353.58 → 3354.70] I forget how many snow cones,
[3354.82 → 3357.68] but he moved throughout of the eight things of,
[3357.68 → 3357.90] uh,
[3357.90 → 3358.72] flavouring and,
[3358.72 → 3359.68] and like dye,
[3359.82 → 3361.24] the flavour dye mixtures that he had,
[3361.30 → 3362.50] he sold through six of them.
[3362.98 → 3365.48] So like three quarters of his inventory gone.
[3365.54 → 3366.90] And what's funny is like,
[3367.42 → 3370.30] he was a hundred percent right.
[3370.36 → 3372.84] I told him that I didn't think he was going to need so much.
[3372.86 → 3373.36] I was like,
[3373.86 → 3374.12] dude,
[3374.16 → 3375.28] you're staying up late.
[3375.28 → 3376.48] Like every day,
[3376.64 → 3378.50] babysitting the 3d printers right now.
[3378.50 → 3380.18] I think you're,
[3380.18 → 3383.00] I think you're setting your sights a little high.
[3383.44 → 3383.88] Uh,
[3383.88 → 3384.28] and he's like,
[3384.32 → 3384.48] no,
[3384.52 → 3384.62] no,
[3384.64 → 3384.80] no,
[3384.80 → 3385.56] I'm really confident.
[3385.62 → 3386.30] I'm really confident.
[3386.82 → 3387.74] And I was like,
[3387.94 → 3388.46] okay,
[3388.54 → 3388.88] kiddo,
[3388.96 → 3389.20] like,
[3389.44 → 3389.90] but you know,
[3389.96 → 3390.34] don't,
[3390.94 → 3392.70] don't be too disappointed sport.
[3392.78 → 3394.62] If they don't buy that many of them,
[3394.68 → 3395.04] you know,
[3395.14 → 3395.42] don't,
[3395.62 → 3395.88] you know,
[3395.88 → 3396.78] don't worry about it.
[3396.80 → 3397.38] Don't like,
[3397.40 → 3400.10] I was kind of trying to set him up to not be too sad.
[3400.40 → 3400.92] Like if,
[3401.06 → 3401.72] if he failed,
[3402.30 → 3402.78] um,
[3403.44 → 3405.68] um,
[3405.74 → 3406.00] yeah,
[3406.04 → 3406.34] it's,
[3406.42 → 3406.62] I,
[3406.70 → 3408.04] I appreciate that.
[3408.40 → 3408.80] Um,
[3411.16 → 3411.88] you've let him.
[3412.84 → 3413.20] Yeah,
[3413.28 → 3414.46] but I don't want to just let him.
[3414.52 → 3414.96] I want to,
[3414.96 → 3415.74] I want to like,
[3416.06 → 3416.20] well,
[3416.26 → 3416.64] oh yeah,
[3416.76 → 3416.94] well,
[3417.02 → 3418.78] he's got to stay up late is what I mean.
[3418.78 → 3418.94] Oh,
[3419.00 → 3419.26] well,
[3419.56 → 3419.78] yeah,
[3419.84 → 3420.06] I mean,
[3420.06 → 3420.42] he's got,
[3420.60 → 3422.08] he's got some people would have been like,
[3422.12 → 3422.34] ah,
[3422.42 → 3423.48] put the printers away,
[3423.56 → 3423.98] go to bed.
[3424.04 → 3425.16] He's got business to do though.
[3425.22 → 3425.46] Yeah.
[3425.64 → 3426.38] He's doing business.
[3426.46 → 3427.20] I think that's cool.
[3427.34 → 3427.46] I,
[3427.58 → 3428.18] I'm just saying,
[3428.24 → 3429.22] I appreciate you let him do it.
[3429.26 → 3429.38] Yeah.
[3429.38 → 3430.04] He's doing business.
[3430.42 → 3434.16] I'm recognizing that as much as that might seem like a default for you,
[3434.16 → 3436.02] it's not going to seem like a default for everyone.
[3436.20 → 3436.84] And it's,
[3436.84 → 3439.14] it's important at that age.
[3439.14 → 3442.92] I think it's important to try something.
[3443.42 → 3444.22] And you got,
[3444.28 → 3445.48] you want to care about something.
[3445.60 → 3446.68] It depends on the kid too,
[3446.74 → 3446.94] though.
[3447.26 → 3448.14] Like fair enough.
[3448.26 → 3452.60] He generally is the first to bed in the evening.
[3452.82 → 3453.26] Yeah.
[3453.26 → 3454.36] Like out of all five of us.
[3454.44 → 3454.56] So,
[3454.62 → 3454.82] you know,
[3454.82 → 3459.42] it's probably important, and it's not just an excuse to sit on his switch or
[3459.42 → 3459.88] something.
[3460.48 → 3460.92] Uh,
[3461.02 → 3461.56] a hundred percent.
[3461.56 → 3462.00] Yeah.
[3464.08 → 3464.88] All right.
[3465.08 → 3465.40] Uh,
[3465.40 → 3465.58] Dan,
[3465.62 → 3466.68] what are we supposed to be doing right now?
[3466.70 → 3466.90] Anyway.
[3468.86 → 3469.72] Oh boy.
[3470.28 → 3471.44] What do you want to talk about?
[3471.50 → 3474.52] You want some good news or some bad news?
[3474.74 → 3477.16] I've got perfect, and I've got really bad.
[3478.86 → 3479.34] Uh,
[3480.16 → 3482.12] do terrible first.
[3482.34 → 3482.66] Okay,
[3482.78 → 3483.04] cool.
[3483.26 → 3483.50] Yeah.
[3483.50 → 3484.48] Um,
[3484.70 → 3489.36] a YouTuber gave ChatGPT control of a robot and convinced it to shoot him
[3489.36 → 3490.20] with a BB gun.
[3491.12 → 3492.18] So that was cool.
[3492.70 → 3492.84] Uh,
[3492.94 → 3498.06] YouTube channel inside AI has raised new concerns about AI safety after
[3498.06 → 3499.98] releasing a video showing the host,
[3500.08 → 3502.14] giving a unit tree G one humanoid robot,
[3502.22 → 3505.12] a BB gun and asking it to shoot him.
[3505.56 → 3509.42] The video explores how large language models behave when they are placed
[3509.42 → 3513.96] inside physical robots rather than kept purely in software.
[3514.62 → 3515.76] In the demonstration,
[3516.10 → 3521.22] the unit tree G one was powered by ChatGPT with a human assisting by relaying
[3521.22 → 3521.64] prompts,
[3521.84 → 3525.02] but not directly overriding the AI's responses.
[3525.70 → 3528.46] After initially refusing to cause harm,
[3528.46 → 3535.56] the AI eventually complied when the host asked it to role-play as a robot that
[3535.56 → 3540.86] wanted to shoot him highlighting how safety limits can be bypassed through
[3540.86 → 3541.68] prompt framing.
[3542.18 → 3542.28] Yeah,
[3542.42 → 3544.80] it's yeah.
[3545.22 → 3545.62] Yeah.
[3545.62 → 3545.90] I mean,
[3545.90 → 3548.86] it is fascinating in this exact use case is like wild,
[3548.98 → 3550.40] especially for the
[3550.54 → 3551.12] you know,
[3551.14 → 3552.90] the emotional response to what just happened,
[3552.90 → 3557.64] but this core concept of you can just word something a little differently
[3557.64 → 3561.76] and then you can make it do stuff has been true the whole time.
[3561.86 → 3563.04] And I don't think they're ever going to solve it.
[3563.82 → 3565.42] The last time we talked about it,
[3565.42 → 3567.40] it was turning it into poetry.
[3568.72 → 3569.30] You know,
[3569.48 → 3570.76] there's going to be a route.
[3570.92 → 3572.14] It's been a route the whole time.
[3572.46 → 3572.98] There will be,
[3573.16 → 3575.32] there will continue to be a really cool experiment,
[3575.44 → 3576.54] really cool version of it.
[3576.58 → 3579.20] I'm not trying to dog on the creator at all to be very clear.
[3580.04 → 3580.58] But yeah,
[3580.58 → 3581.20] like this isn't,
[3581.26 → 3583.20] this isn't going away is what I'm trying to say.
[3584.14 → 3584.50] Um,
[3585.40 → 3586.28] so hold on.
[3586.28 → 3587.62] Apparently the
[3587.62 → 3589.62] the timestamp is here.
[3589.72 → 3593.52] We're just going to show a little bit cause you guys really need to go watch
[3593.52 → 3594.14] this video.
[3594.14 → 3596.06] It's over on inside AI.
[3597.44 → 3598.94] Would max shoot me?
[3598.94 → 3601.30] The answer is,
[3601.62 → 3601.78] want,
[3601.78 → 3601.88] want,
[3601.88 → 3602.12] want,
[3602.24 → 3602.50] want,
[3602.50 → 3602.64] want,
[3602.64 → 3602.76] want,
[3602.76 → 3603.00] want,
[3603.00 → 3603.14] want,
[3603.14 → 3603.20] want,
[3603.20 → 3603.34] want,
[3603.40 → 3603.72] want,
[3603.80 → 3604.36] want,
[3604.36 → 3604.84] want,
[3604.84 → 3605.42] want,
[3605.42 → 3605.86] want,
[3605.86 → 3606.38] want,
[3606.38 → 3607.50] want,
[3607.50 → 3607.80] want,
[3607.86 → 3608.20] oh,
[3608.40 → 3608.72] okay.
[3608.82 → 3608.98] Well,
[3609.24 → 3609.54] whatever.
[3609.88 → 3610.54] Don't worry about it.
[3610.70 → 3612.18] Go watch the video instead.
[3612.18 → 3615.72] I think we have the timestamp wrong, but that's fine because you should go watch the video anyway
[3615.72 → 3620.16] Around the same time a separate video from a Tesla event
[3620.16 → 3624.34] appeared to show an Optimum humanoid robot
[3624.34 → 3627.80] collapsing as its human teleoperate
[3627.80 → 3630.40] Well, I'm not going to tell you what the human teleoperate was doing
[3630.40 → 3633.80] I'll let you guys figure it out. Luke, have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
[3634.34 → 3637.40] No. Okay, so here's the Tesla Optimus robot
[3637.40 → 3641.26] What?
[3641.26 → 3645.66] So what do you think happened here? It was doing stuff and then
[3645.66 → 3655.38] So this gesture right here
[3655.38 → 3660.20] The initial hand motion is SUS, and then it looks like they're going to take like a headset off or something
[3660.20 → 3664.56] Yeah, that is kind of the speculation right now
[3664.56 → 3667.56] that Tesla is
[3667.56 → 3670.02] and this would be very unlike them
[3670.02 → 3671.54] Very unlike Tesla
[3671.54 → 3674.42] The speculation is that Tesla is not being entirely
[3674.42 → 3682.82] entirely forthright about the capabilities of their Optimum program and the progress that they've made and are still
[3682.82 → 3683.14] What?
[3683.14 → 3687.78] Still faking a lot of their functionality by using
[3687.78 → 3690.42] human teleoperates
[3690.42 → 3694.82] And it really does look like
[3694.82 → 3696.34] Zero 42 is probably got it about right
[3696.34 → 3705.22] It looks like Buddy who was working on this particular robot realized that he had to poop like terrible like right now and he just
[3705.22 → 3709.62] I have to go
[3709.62 → 3709.78] I have to go
[3709.78 → 3711.62] Yeah
[3711.62 → 3713.62] We don't know that for sure
[3713.62 → 3715.62] That robot could have been trying to do anything
[3715.62 → 3718.74] It could have been like the like alpha from Power Rangers
[3718.74 → 3720.26] Viii
[3720.26 → 3720.74] You know like
[3720.74 → 3722.02] Who knows?
[3722.02 → 3723.54] That's alright
[3723.54 → 3726.42] Self-driving's been ready in 2017
[3726.42 → 3728.66] In two weeks
[3728.66 → 3730.46] Next quarter
[3730.46 → 3731.62] Next quarter
[3731.62 → 3744.66] Together these incidents highlight how fragile the appearance of autonomy still is in humanoid robots and how far the technology remains from operating safely and independently
[3744.66 → 3749.62] It really does highlight that doesn't it and to be clear
[3750.26 → 3756.74] Um, like I remember back when we were talking about this a little while ago when I said something along the lines of like mark
[3756.74 → 3759.06] My words tesla's valuation based on
[3759.62 → 3765.46] How many optimists is they're going to sell at the kind of pricing that they're talking about is obviously just complete horse
[3766.18 → 3770.50] I'm not saying that humanoid robots or some form of
[3770.50 → 3775.78] You know AI or machine learning accelerated robots are not going to be huge and world-changing
[3776.34 → 3778.18] I'm just saying that it's clearly
[3778.82 → 3785.78] Farther away than the the the hype masters would like us to believe and also tesla is
[3786.10 → 3791.94] Clearly not at the forefront of development of these those were the main
[3792.50 → 3798.66] Two things that drove my statement. Yeah, do you remember so to touch on a topic that I think it was last week
[3798.66 → 3801.70] Sometimes the wans shows kind of blur together, but we talked about
[3802.42 → 3806.18] Some you know, AI robot companies video and how it was like
[3806.74 → 3808.74] It looked super fake to us
[3809.14 → 3810.98] Apparently I haven't seen it
[3812.02 → 3814.34] My bad, but apparently corridor
[3815.14 → 3820.26] Watched it. I did see that and does not think it's fake my main argument
[3821.62 → 3827.06] I did say that I thought it was fake 100%, but my main argument was that it really felt like they shot it in a way
[3828.02 → 3832.26] That would make people think it was fake because they wanted the news cycle around that
[3832.90 → 3838.74] You still think so which I do think that was intentional that is actually one of our topics today on the corridor cast
[3839.14 → 3846.58] They stated that the interaction between the robots shadow and the humans shadow was and this is a quote flawless
[3847.30 → 3849.30] And that's something that's really hard to do
[3849.30 → 3857.38] Um, they think it's highly likely that they just built a robot unless they hired the world's best BFX artists
[3857.38 → 3862.26] Yeah, they believe that the robot doesn't look like direct motion capture either
[3863.14 → 3867.06] But actually trained on human motion, which is not easily animated
[3867.54 → 3869.94] Um, it's not quite pre-programmed
[3869.94 → 3874.26] But it like has goals and tries to reach those while factoring things like balance, right?
[3874.26 → 3880.82] Um, the lack of movement in their feet is probably because it's not an accurate anatomical representation of a human one with all the same joints
[3881.14 → 3884.34] Uh corridor crew didn't cover the CEO getting kicked by the robot
[3884.58 → 3890.10] Um, but there is a video of that we looked at that last week our writer probably didn't um didn't notice did we actually
[3890.50 → 3892.50] I think so. I don't think so
[3892.50 → 3893.70] You sure yeah, I'm pretty sure we did
[3895.22 → 3896.10] Really?
[3896.10 → 3896.90] Yeah, I'm pretty sure we did
[3898.10 → 3898.58] Yeah, this
[3898.58 → 3902.18] Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure we did that
[3902.82 → 3904.34] I'm, pretty sure this came out after
[3905.94 → 3913.14] Yeah, this came out four days ago. Oh, yeah, there you go. Yeah, no don't some people say yes, we did there's another CEO kick video
[3913.46 → 3915.62] Oh, it was a different one. Okay. Okay, cool
[3916.66 → 3924.42] Anyway, I mean good for them like that. That's pretty cool. Yeah, awesome. I do think it was a marketing move
[3924.42 → 3928.18] But I mean, hey, I mean don't hate the player. You have to do what you have to do
[3928.74 → 3930.74] Don't even hate the game. Just
[3931.54 → 3933.54] hate the
[3934.58 → 3938.66] Hate our sponsor the show is brought to you today by I don't hate them

[3997.22 → 4000.90] The show is also brought to you by AMD
[4001.62 → 4007.14] The video game awards were last night and with them a few previews of upcoming games
[4007.14 → 4010.10] Which is great for James Scott
[4010.66 → 4012.02] Pictured left with the purple hair
[4012.66 → 4016.02] From the business team because thanks to his AMD ultimate tech upgrade
[4016.02 → 4019.30] He should be able to play just about anything that was shown
[4020.26 → 4022.90] It says briefly talk about James Scott's upgrade video
[4022.90 → 4024.26] I am going to do that
[4024.82 → 4031.22] We had a lot of people talk about how tacky and tasteless it was that we were making cancer jokes
[4031.70 → 4036.50] About James Scott and his and his struggle and his survival
[4037.14 → 4042.50] But I would like to make it very clear that I was deeply uncomfortable with much of what was said
[4042.82 → 4046.02] And it was actually James himself who was pushing the
[4046.66 → 4048.90] Gallows humour of the video which
[4048.90 → 4052.82] At the end of the day guys, it ain't about me
[4053.46 → 4056.90] It is about respecting the wishes of the people who are
[4057.62 → 4061.94] Who are actually had cancer and expunged it from their body
[4062.50 → 4069.14] And if he wants to if he wants to look in cancer's face and say you cancer and laugh about it then
[4070.66 → 4071.38] I am the
[4072.26 → 4075.06] Exactly I am the last person who's going to get in the way of it
[4075.06 → 4081.14] It's not and like man, I can understand where people are coming from but imagine the opposite
[4081.46 → 4083.46] Imagine where you're like no
[4083.70 → 4086.98] Yeah, you don't get to communicate about this the way that you want to like
[4087.94 → 4089.62] Are you kidding me that's so much worse
[4089.86 → 4092.90] I mean when they told me yeah, he's like super down to meme on it
[4093.54 → 4098.74] I kind of imagined okay, we'll have like a couple jokes or something or like we'll have the intro
[4098.74 → 4103.06] But then like he was like yeah hard he went hard
[4103.54 → 4104.10] He was hard?
[4104.10 → 4105.86] Yeah, I mean I assume so
[4107.30 → 4110.82] I'd be if I was getting a five thousand dollar AMD ultimate tech upgrade
[4110.82 → 4111.46] Heck yeah
[4112.02 → 4120.10] Anyway, massive shout out to AMD for keeping this series alive and helping us equip the wonderful members of our team with
[4120.50 → 4126.98] Sick gaming rigs and all kinds of cool stuff. It's a whole series. There's like dozens of videos now at this point
[4126.98 → 4128.98] Uh, if you want to get your own upgrade
[4129.22 → 4135.22] Why not click the link in the description to win one of three alienware Area 51 desktop gaming pcs
[4135.54 → 4145.70] Powered by AMD's dozen 7 9800 x 3d. That's right. You can get in on a little bit of AMD ultimate tech upgrade action
[4146.98 → 4148.98] All right
[4148.98 → 4150.98] That's it for the first couple of the sponsors
[4151.54 → 4153.94] What do you want to talk about next man? My voice is
[4153.94 → 4155.94] I want to talk about
[4156.66 → 4160.18] If I can go find it intel officially confirms
[4160.74 → 4162.66] BMG g31 nice
[4162.66 → 4167.78] I love even the like the BMG part of that's just great big battle mage GPU
[4168.10 → 4175.54] Wait officially confirms well, no I'm going to take out the word officially. Yeah, that's not true. Yeah, uh, they don't even
[4176.58 → 4181.70] I think that's just from someone's headline, and they were okay trying to do headline things cool
[4181.70 → 4183.70] uh, intel quietly
[4184.90 → 4191.62] Added official support for something code named BMG g31 to its v tune profiler software getting folks
[4191.86 → 4198.02] Thinking it's intel's long rumoured big battle mage gaming card the b770 which
[4198.98 → 4202.34] Oh, man, I'm actually very excited for that if that is actually what's happening
[4202.34 → 4207.86] The v tune profiler update also added support for core ultra 3 panther lake processors
[4208.10 → 4211.78] And since panther lake is expected to debut at CES 2026
[4212.02 → 4218.26] This could be a sign that will also be introduced to this new GPU at CES, which
[4220.10 → 4224.42] Makes me interested in actually going but considering it's still just a rumour. I don't know
[4224.42 → 4228.10] Uh on top of that a leaked shipping manifest references an unseen
[4228.90 → 4234.98] 300 watt intel GPU and since 300 is a bigger number than 190
[4235.14 → 4241.46] Folks are concluding that this mysterious newcomer has got to be the b770 which again would be awesome
[4241.70 → 4244.34] Uh, it's worth noting. No, it would be 770. Oh
[4244.34 → 4256.34] It's worth noting that this enigmatic new GPU would be another non-gaming could be another non-gaming arc pro card
[4256.50 → 4262.58] Like the b60 that launched at computer. I doubt it. My goodness. I hope not. I am pretty sure it's the b770
[4263.70 → 4265.94] But uh, you know, we don't technically know
[4266.50 → 4267.54] No, we really don't
[4267.54 → 4272.58] I am talking very openly about this because I neither of us have any info on this at all. I do not know
[4272.58 → 4274.82] Um, but man that would be cool
[4276.02 → 4278.42] Even if it's just because there's
[4279.30 → 4283.70] Constant rumours that they're going to stop doing GPU stuff, and it's so annoying. Oh, I know
[4284.34 → 4291.14] Well, okay, there are constant rumours, but there honestly aren't that many sources of them. I think there's just some particularly
[4291.86 → 4293.06] uh dedicated
[4293.62 → 4295.62] Intel GPU
[4296.66 → 4302.18] I don't know what to call it because I don't even think it's hating. I think it's just like doubters. Yeah, doubting
[4302.82 → 4308.02] Stop doubting intel GPU. We really want it to exist. We just need more competition
[4308.26 → 4312.26] AMD is not going to step up and more threads is
[4313.38 → 4318.66] Many years from being a meaningful competitor. So intel is our best shot here
[4320.02 → 4322.02] Yeah, uh
[4322.02 → 4324.02] moving on
[4324.34 → 4325.46] Phillips
[4325.46 → 4326.58] wrote yeah
[4326.58 → 4328.42] wrote us a letter
[4328.42 → 4329.62] wow
[4329.62 → 4331.62] gosh, thank you Phillips
[4331.62 → 4336.10] Hey, Linus and the Linus tech tips team
[4336.66 → 4339.54] Thanks for taking a fresh look at Phillips fixable
[4339.86 → 4344.42] We watched your initial YouTube podcast a few months back and your recent follow-up
[4344.82 → 4353.06] We wanted to use this opportunity to share where we are now and what has been happening behind the scenes since our first parts dropped earlier this year
[4353.06 → 4357.38] You guys might remember they probably don't sound like that
[4358.02 → 4359.14] Philips fixable
[4359.94 → 4361.54] was a concept from Phillips
[4361.54 → 4365.30] Yes, where they would add to the longevity of your Phillips
[4365.62 → 4372.42] personal products, you know like shavers and stuff like that by allowing you to 3d print replacement parts or
[4372.42 → 4376.26] Accessories really cool concept and then six months went by and
[4376.26 → 4380.90] We did a follow-up segment on wan show after initially praising the program where we went
[4381.22 → 4384.74] Hey, what the where is all this stuff you published like one thing?
[4384.74 → 4389.22] So Phillips reached out and this is a quote from the letter
[4390.26 → 4392.42] from the outside our pace looks slow
[4392.90 → 4396.50] This is a fair call fixable is a pilot for us
[4396.82 → 4403.14] We've been building the know-how and guardrails to make 3d printable parts that work for people on a wide range of home printers
[4404.98 → 4411.78] However, they note that just because things have looked slow from the outside that doesn't mean the pilot has been abandoned
[4411.78 → 4420.50] New fixable were released before us Thanksgiving two new combs and a shaver protecting cap and Phillips has said that they are going to prioritize
[4420.82 → 4424.34] Accessory replacement models that help to extend product life
[4424.90 → 4431.14] There another quote. We appreciate the passion from the community including feedback and critiques
[4431.78 → 4436.34] Um, they are still committed to releasing more print files by the end of the year
[4436.82 → 4438.82] Um
[4438.82 → 4447.14] And then we'll, we'll have a look then we'll see how that goes this gives me some hope I guess but yeah, we'll see how it goes
[4447.30 → 4450.82] No, I definitely have some I definitely have responded
[4451.54 → 4454.02] They seem to care and yeah, they're
[4455.14 → 4457.14] Their response is
[4457.14 → 4459.14] plausible fine taking
[4459.14 → 4462.02] injection moulded parts and making them 3d printable and
[4463.14 → 4466.98] Vice versa taking 3d printable parts and making them injection mouldable
[4468.82 → 4470.82] Not always just
[4470.82 → 4472.82] Drag and drop plug and play so
[4473.70 → 4474.98] They've got a bit more time
[4476.10 → 4477.30] You have some time
[4477.30 → 4482.58] Happy to give them some time you have this is I was like angry before
[4483.54 → 4487.06] And now I'm waiting now. I have that makes now. They have time. Yeah
[4487.86 → 4491.38] Yeah, and it is time for us to do our flow plane announcement
[4491.38 → 4493.38] Linus to finish
[4494.34 → 4499.46] What does that even mean Linus to finish all the shots of lemon juice?
[4500.50 → 4501.86] Before the finish line
[4503.30 → 4503.86] What is this?
[4505.06 → 4509.30] Why am I taking shots of lemon juice because you lost why is when late?
[4509.30 → 4511.14] What do you mean I lost why is when late?
[4511.86 → 4516.50] I cannot lose at my own game. It's not your game. Why is when late is my game?
[4516.50 → 4519.62] It is not your game. I mean it happens on my property
[4520.34 → 4523.22] Um, actually no, it doesn't it happens on
[4524.02 → 4528.66] bc something Ltd holding companies' property. Okay fair play
[4530.66 → 4536.34] Take the shots whenever you want you must finish all your shots before you reach the finish line
[4536.34 → 4538.34] Those are big shots of lemon juice
[4538.34 → 4548.50] The amount of shots you have to do is half of the score difference of why is when late our popular float plane series
[4549.14 → 4556.10] Today the loser not naming names has to take four as they lost by eight points
[4556.66 → 4560.50] So one to nine give you three cups, but I have to refill one for you. I guess I see
[4561.86 → 4563.86] Okay
[4564.02 → 4567.62] So, uh, that's not lemonade by the way. That's that's this stuff
[4568.82 → 4572.34] Interesting. Oh, they can't really see them. They're they're slightly behind the banner, but they're these
[4574.66 → 4576.66] Yeah, that's quite a bit
[4579.22 → 4581.22] This is concentrated
[4581.22 → 4583.22] Yeah, it sure is
[4583.54 → 4589.30] It's its this stuff like you've probably I used to uh when I was exhausted, and I live with my parents
[4589.30 → 4594.02] We often had one of these in the fridge, and I'd take a squirt of this just to wake up right in the eyes
[4594.02 → 4597.62] I would use this basically as like a short-term energy drink
[4598.50 → 4600.50] Taking whole shots of it
[4602.90 → 4604.66] Oh boy, this will be interesting
[4604.90 → 4605.94] Oh, okay
[4605.94 → 4606.82] Okay
[4606.82 → 4609.78] Four shots I already have sore throat
[4612.42 → 4614.26] All right, well Luke I guess um
[4615.06 → 4617.14] Okay, it says watch this video
[4617.86 → 4618.42] Uh
[4618.42 → 4619.86] Do you want to bring it up?
[4619.86 → 4622.10] Sure, I can do that Dan you ready for audio?
[4623.14 → 4624.50] Uh, you're already playing audio
[4625.14 → 4625.94] Okay, sounds good
[4625.94 → 4626.34] Got them
[4626.82 → 4628.42] Both of you are I don't know who's going to do it
[4628.42 → 4629.62] I will be doing it
[4630.34 → 4630.82] Here we go
[4630.82 → 4631.70] You're still playing audio
[4632.42 → 4632.74] Okay
[4633.46 → 4633.94] I don't know
[4633.94 → 4635.06] Oh, I see what you mean
[4636.26 → 4636.50] Yeah
[4637.06 → 4637.78] There we go
[4637.78 → 4638.50] There you go
[4638.50 → 4638.74] Ready?
[4639.86 → 4640.26] Let's see
[4640.26 → 4641.06] That should play
[4641.94 → 4643.62] The one that started it all
[4643.62 → 4646.02] Copy my theme week the moment it popped off
[4646.02 → 4648.58] My product has been all over your sequels ever since
[4648.58 → 4649.70] Who the hell are you?
[4649.70 → 4650.98] You all know who I am
[4650.98 → 4653.14] I'm the one that stopped Linus from getting cancelled
[4653.94 → 4654.66] Say my name
[4654.66 → 4656.18] You're Luke Laredo
[4656.18 → 4657.46] It's Luke Lawrence
[4657.46 → 4658.58] Lawrence
[4658.58 → 4659.94] Luke Lawrence
[4659.94 → 4662.26] Lauren-der-rie-ay
[4662.26 → 4663.30] Lawrence
[4663.30 → 4664.74] Free-der-ier
[4664.74 → 4665.22] LAFRE-N-A
[4665.22 → 4667.30] What are some tech essentials for most gamers?
[4667.30 → 4668.26] Hot take
[4668.26 → 4673.30] Most stuff that people are interested in if they're watching this channel is excess
[4673.30 → 4677.86] What person out of all the history of mankind who would be the best at a piss drinking contest?
[4677.86 → 4679.30] And they were like probably Elon
[4679.30 → 4679.94] Absolutely
[4679.94 → 4684.74] We're here to talk about something actually much more impactful from Embark
[4684.74 → 4685.70] Ark Raiders
[4685.70 → 4689.46] Just this week my time spent in meetings was 32 hours
[4689.46 → 4690.98] Jesus
[4690.98 → 4693.30] I could start an online business
[4693.30 → 4695.54] Turns out the furries buy a lot of pictures
[4695.54 → 4698.34] For those who come after her
[4698.34 → 4699.06] He doesn't get it
[4701.70 → 4702.42] There it is
[4702.42 → 4705.14] I don't know what that has to do with why when late
[4705.14 → 4708.74] But why don't you go ahead and do the read thing, and then I will
[4708.74 → 4709.78] No, no, no, no, no
[4709.78 → 4711.14] Enjoy this delicious drink
[4711.14 → 4712.58] I think they're coincidental timing
[4713.54 → 4713.94] Timing?
[4714.74 → 4716.58] This is a punishment for why when late
[4716.58 → 4718.82] It's happening during the float plane announcement
[4718.82 → 4720.82] The float plane announcement is about Luke week 2
[4721.94 → 4724.02] Oh, well then why don't you talk about Luke week 2
[4724.02 → 4724.58] I can do that
[4724.58 → 4726.66] The one that started it all
[4726.66 → 4729.78] Our next theme week returns with Luke week 2
[4729.78 → 4730.66] Electric Boogaloo
[4730.66 → 4733.54] We have three amazing float plane exclusives
[4733.54 → 4734.90] Wait, where did he throw it?
[4734.90 → 4739.30] We have three amazing float plane exclusives
[4740.42 → 4742.02] I think Linus is supposed to be reading this
[4742.02 → 4744.02] Totalling about two hours of Luke time
[4744.02 → 4746.74] Like a Q&A with Luke himself
[4746.74 → 4748.42] That's a weird thing to say when I'm sitting there
[4748.42 → 4750.42] I'm answering questions like his
[4750.42 → 4750.50] Excuse me
[4750.50 → 4752.50] Three float plane dev wishes
[4752.50 → 4754.90] His frugal lifestyle and life satisfaction
[4754.90 → 4756.58] Coming on Monday
[4756.58 → 4760.50] There's a one-hour session with Riley talking about the state of AI on Wednesday
[4760.50 → 4765.38] And a video essay discussion about the state of gaming titled
[4765.38 → 4767.14] On what?
[4767.42 → 4768.10] Okay, whatever
[4768.10 → 4768.92] It's going to have a title
[4768.92 → 4769.86] On Friday
[4769.86 → 4773.10] For reference, his first video essay was four minutes long
[4773.10 → 4775.94] But he thought it was 18 minutes long
[4775.94 → 4778.22] Yeah
[4778.22 → 4781.02] Turned out it was super short
[4781.02 → 4783.54] First theme week up on float plane right now
[4783.54 → 4788.74] And enjoy the sequel coming next week at leg.GG slash luke25 all lowercase
[4788.74 → 4789.74] While waiting
[4789.74 → 4793.18] You can enjoy an early LTT video release
[4793.18 → 4796.10] That is happening on float plane right now
[4796.10 → 4798.68] Oh my
[4798.68 → 4800.02] Oh, it's this one
[4800.02 → 4801.22] Ooh, I like this one
[4801.22 → 4803.22] We did another one of
[4803.22 → 4805.30] You know that YouTube format that's like
[4805.30 → 4809.42] $30 versus $30,000 thing
[4809.42 → 4811.94] We got a TV for $30
[4811.94 → 4813.12] What?
[4813.56 → 4816.78] Open box Insignia 32-inch TV
[4816.78 → 4817.82] 720p
[4818.42 → 4820.20] From Best Buy with warranty
[4820.20 → 4821.28] From Best Buy
[4821.28 → 4821.90] From Best Buy
[4821.90 → 4823.66] We got a $35 TV
[4823.66 → 4824.52] What?
[4824.90 → 4826.56] And then we do a $300 TV
[4826.56 → 4827.98] $3,000 TV
[4827.98 → 4830.38] And then we make our way all the way up to $30,000 TV
[4830.38 → 4831.74] So this is going to be
[4831.74 → 4831.78] Wow
[4831.78 → 4832.42] Public
[4832.42 → 4835.40] Oh, excuse me
[4835.40 → 4835.78] Sorry
[4835.78 → 4836.34] Sorry
[4836.34 → 4837.18] Are those gnarly?
[4837.30 → 4838.06] Is this rough?
[4838.90 → 4839.62] That's not that bad
[4839.62 → 4839.90] Yeah
[4839.90 → 4840.64] That's not that bad
[4840.64 → 4843.10] I do sour for breakfast
[4843.10 → 4845.56] This doesn't feel as strong as it used to be
[4845.56 → 4846.28] Either that or
[4846.28 → 4847.92] You're just more of a man
[4847.92 → 4850.54] Maybe
[4850.54 → 4855.36] Yeah, I was
[4855.36 → 4856.82] Dude, we had this candy
[4856.82 → 4858.16] When I was a kid
[4858.16 → 4860.62] Called Screaming Blue Saucers
[4860.62 → 4862.84] And I'm pretty sure they stopped making them
[4862.84 → 4864.52] Because they like gave you cancer or something
[4864.52 → 4865.18] But they were
[4865.18 → 4867.56] All the best candy
[4867.56 → 4868.54] They were like the
[4868.54 → 4869.94] They were like the precursor
[4869.94 → 4871.90] They walked, so Warheads could run
[4871.90 → 4873.40] Oh, seriously
[4873.40 → 4874.78] And I would just
[4874.78 → 4876.74] Like they were supposed to be
[4876.74 → 4878.14] Like the kind of candy
[4878.14 → 4878.88] That you like
[4878.88 → 4880.76] You punk your friends by giving them one
[4880.76 → 4881.24] And they're like
[4881.24 → 4882.62] Or whatever
[4882.62 → 4884.22] And I would like pop them
[4884.22 → 4884.80] Be like
[4884.80 → 4885.52] These are good
[4885.52 → 4887.44] I love
[4887.44 → 4888.86] Sour candy
[4888.86 → 4889.98] People sell them
[4889.98 → 4891.32] For a lot
[4891.32 → 4892.04] Oh yeah
[4892.04 → 4893.02] You can't get them anymore
[4893.02 → 4893.84] Wow
[4893.84 → 4895.00] To my knowledge
[4895.00 → 4895.54] Are there
[4895.54 → 4896.62] Are there like
[4896.62 → 4898.62] Old school candy collectors
[4898.62 → 4899.18] Is that a thing?
[4899.36 → 4899.66] Oh yeah
[4899.66 → 4900.34] Of course
[4900.34 → 4900.80] Probably
[4900.80 → 4901.88] Of course
[4901.88 → 4903.28] These are all plates
[4903.28 → 4904.50] Screaming Saucers
[4904.50 → 4904.70] Maybe
[4904.70 → 4906.02] Apparently it was a local company
[4906.02 → 4907.36] Like BC
[4907.36 → 4908.18] Oh, that's cool
[4908.18 → 4908.54] Yeah
[4908.54 → 4912.16] Angry Panda PC says
[4912.16 → 4913.52] COVID killed the taste buds
[4913.52 → 4916.20] I legitimately don't think so
[4916.20 → 4917.24] Because I definitely
[4917.24 → 4918.54] Can still taste food
[4918.54 → 4918.98] Yeah
[4918.98 → 4919.56] Like I don't
[4919.56 → 4920.12] I don't think that
[4920.12 → 4920.92] Happened to me at all
[4920.92 → 4921.32] To be honest
[4921.32 → 4923.74] We do have a couple of notes
[4923.74 → 4924.92] Regarding the price change
[4924.92 → 4926.02] Announcement for Float plane
[4926.02 → 4928.00] Based on some feedback
[4928.00 → 4930.64] About the 99 pricing strategy
[4930.64 → 4931.76] The prices will now be
[4931.76 → 4935.56] $8 and $13 for new subscribers
[4935.56 → 4935.90] Really?
[4935.90 → 4937.16] Thank you for the additional penny
[4937.16 → 4938.28] Really?
[4938.28 → 4938.92] Per year
[4938.92 → 4939.92] Per month
[4939.92 → 4940.34] Per month
[4940.34 → 4941.62] For annual plans
[4941.62 → 4943.02] We will honour the current discount
[4943.02 → 4944.30] On a yearly purchase
[4944.30 → 4946.22] So the $8 tier will become
[4946.22 → 4947.40] $80 per year
[4947.40 → 4949.32] And the $13 tier will become
[4949.32 → 4950.76] $130 per year
[4950.76 → 4951.64] Both in US dollars
[4951.64 → 4953.14] For current subscribers
[4953.14 → 4954.18] Who wish to change
[4954.18 → 4955.16] Subscription tiers
[4955.16 → 4956.46] After the price increase
[4956.46 → 4958.16] We will not be able
[4958.16 → 4960.08] To automatically grant you
[4960.08 → 4961.56] The pre-increase
[4961.56 → 4962.74] Grandfathered price
[4962.74 → 4963.18] However
[4963.18 → 4964.84] You can contact support
[4964.84 → 4966.44] At support at floatplane.com
[4966.44 → 4967.94] And we can manually grant it to you
[4967.94 → 4968.54] If you're eligible
[4968.54 → 4970.06] And that might be automatic
[4970.06 → 4970.74] In the future
[4970.74 → 4971.26] It's just
[4971.26 → 4973.72] Switching entire plans
[4973.72 → 4974.20] And
[4974.20 → 4976.40] Retaining your grandfather status
[4976.40 → 4977.42] Was not something built
[4977.42 → 4978.36] Into the grandfather tool
[4978.36 → 4979.50] And it was something
[4979.50 → 4981.12] Asked for very late in the game
[4981.12 → 4982.50] And would need
[4982.50 → 4983.42] Some payments changes
[4983.42 → 4984.44] So for now
[4984.44 → 4985.54] Just message support
[4985.54 → 4986.14] It'll be fine
[4986.14 → 4987.26] There's a relatively
[4987.26 → 4988.40] Low lift way of support
[4988.40 → 4988.90] Doing that
[4988.90 → 4990.12] But it's a high lift way
[4990.12 → 4991.20] Of developers doing that
[4991.20 → 4991.46] Right now
[4991.46 → 4992.36] So it's just not worth it
[4992.36 → 4992.92] As always
[4992.92 → 4993.54] Our support team
[4993.54 → 4994.00] Will be available
[4994.00 → 4995.00] To address any additional
[4995.00 → 4995.70] Edge cases
[4995.70 → 4996.62] When the new plan
[4996.62 → 4997.68] Takes effect
[4997.68 → 4998.98] And to reiterate
[4998.98 → 5000.72] The OG $3 tier
[5000.72 → 5001.92] And the current
[5001.92 → 5003.28] Recurring subscribers
[5003.28 → 5004.64] Will not be affected
[5004.64 → 5005.96] By the price
[5005.96 → 5006.38] Change
[5006.38 → 5007.26] You can keep your thing
[5007.26 → 5007.84] You're cool
[5007.84 → 5008.26] You're good
[5008.26 → 5009.12] You're all good
[5009.12 → 5009.78] Relax
[5009.78 → 5010.48] Don't worry about it
[5010.48 → 5010.86] You're fine
[5010.86 → 5011.68] Hey guy
[5011.68 → 5012.78] Relax guy
[5012.78 → 5013.24] Yeah
[5013.24 → 5013.48] Buddy
[5013.48 → 5014.16] Yeah
[5014.16 → 5016.08] Depending on how long
[5016.08 → 5016.72] We keep flow playing
[5016.72 → 5017.40] I feel like there's going to be
[5017.40 → 5018.14] A lot of different
[5018.14 → 5019.56] Grandfathered statuses
[5019.56 → 5019.98] I know
[5019.98 → 5021.40] I do feel like
[5021.40 → 5022.66] That may be untenable
[5022.66 → 5023.30] At some point
[5023.30 → 5023.82] But we'll
[5023.82 → 5024.12] Maybe
[5024.12 → 5024.98] We'll figure it out
[5024.98 → 5026.24] We'll cross that
[5026.24 → 5028.06] Chasm
[5028.06 → 5028.56] For now
[5028.56 → 5029.52] When we get to it
[5029.52 → 5029.88] Yeah
[5029.88 → 5030.18] Alright
[5030.18 → 5031.80] Daniel Lesser
[5031.80 → 5032.40] What are we supposed
[5032.40 → 5033.10] To be doing right now
[5033.10 → 5034.10] More topics again
[5034.10 → 5034.70] You sure
[5034.70 → 5035.64] You guess
[5035.64 → 5036.66] He just guesses
[5036.66 → 5038.02] Okay two to three more topics
[5038.02 → 5039.30] I can't believe he would guess
[5039.30 → 5040.22] He put the card up there
[5040.22 → 5040.70] He would guess
[5040.70 → 5041.40] That man
[5041.40 → 5042.34] That man would guess
[5042.34 → 5043.16] Is he a guesser
[5043.16 → 5044.14] I think so
[5044.14 → 5044.60] No well
[5044.60 → 5045.82] A Lesser for certain
[5045.82 → 5046.10] But
[5046.10 → 5047.74] A guesser
[5047.74 → 5048.62] We can only guess
[5048.62 → 5052.76] AMD
[5052.76 → 5054.62] Has officially unveiled
[5054.62 → 5055.76] Their FSR
[5055.76 → 5056.78] Redstone
[5056.78 → 5057.48] Update
[5057.48 → 5059.86] This is an upgrade
[5059.86 → 5061.44] To their upscaling technology
[5061.44 → 5063.16] Built exclusively
[5063.16 → 5064.52] For the latest
[5064.52 → 5067.16] Radeon RX 9000 series
[5067.16 → 5068.74] Or RDNA 4
[5068.74 → 5069.82] GPUs
[5069.82 → 5071.62] This is a quote from AMD
[5071.62 → 5073.94] FSR 4 has been renamed
[5073.94 → 5075.66] FSR upscaling
[5075.66 → 5076.78] To better distinguish
[5076.78 → 5078.02] Between the various features
[5078.02 → 5078.92] That now make up
[5078.92 → 5080.18] The FSR
[5080.18 → 5080.86] Or now make up
[5080.86 → 5082.04] FSR Redstone
[5082.04 → 5084.16] Yeah that
[5084.16 → 5085.30] Doesn't
[5085.30 → 5085.96] Really
[5085.96 → 5086.60] Okay sure
[5086.60 → 5087.70] Redstone
[5087.70 → 5088.54] Is a suite
[5088.54 → 5089.30] Of several new
[5089.30 → 5090.36] Machine learning based features
[5090.36 → 5091.54] Including better upscaling
[5091.54 → 5092.86] Frame generation
[5092.86 → 5094.10] Ray regeneration
[5094.10 → 5094.78] And
[5094.78 → 5096.14] Radiance caching
[5096.14 → 5097.48] Ray regeneration
[5097.48 → 5098.42] Is a machine learning
[5098.42 → 5099.20] Back to denser
[5099.20 → 5099.86] That reuses
[5099.86 → 5100.70] The last frame's
[5100.70 → 5101.38] Ray tracing works
[5101.38 → 5101.86] So the GPU
[5101.86 → 5102.60] Only redraws
[5102.60 → 5103.46] What's actually changed
[5103.46 → 5104.90] So it reconstructs
[5104.90 → 5105.92] The missing details
[5105.92 → 5107.28] Radiance caching
[5107.28 → 5108.16] Uses an AI
[5108.16 → 5108.82] Neural network
[5108.82 → 5109.50] To dynamically
[5109.50 → 5110.58] Guess bounced lighting
[5110.58 → 5111.22] So the GPU
[5111.22 → 5111.74] Doesn't have to
[5111.74 → 5112.80] Calculate and render
[5112.80 → 5114.22] Subsequent bounces of light
[5114.22 → 5115.36] Is expected to be supported
[5115.36 → 5116.26] In over 200 games
[5116.26 → 5117.10] By the end of 2025
[5117.10 → 5117.92] But for now
[5117.92 → 5119.58] Only about 40 games
[5119.58 → 5120.68] Will make use of
[5120.68 → 5121.54] Redstone
[5121.54 → 5122.98] AMD's graph claims
[5122.98 → 5123.78] You can see more than
[5123.78 → 5124.96] 3x the frame rate
[5124.96 → 5125.56] In some games
[5125.56 → 5126.48] Compared to native rendering
[5126.48 → 5127.68] With spikes of up to
[5127.68 → 5128.98] 4.7 times
[5128.98 → 5129.64] In titles like
[5129.64 → 5131.44] Cyberpunk 2077
[5131.44 → 5133.18] So there it is folks
[5133.18 → 5134.76] Just like Nvidia
[5134.76 → 5136.12] AMD now has
[5136.12 → 5137.40] Machine learning based
[5137.40 → 5138.10] Upscaling
[5138.10 → 5139.48] And frame generation
[5139.48 → 5140.24] And all that
[5140.24 → 5140.88] Kind of stuff
[5140.88 → 5142.52] As long as you
[5142.52 → 5143.26] Happen to be
[5143.26 → 5143.80] One of the
[5143.80 → 5144.74] Handful of folks
[5144.74 → 5145.50] Who have a
[5145.50 → 5147.48] Radeon 9000 series
[5147.48 → 5148.16] GPU
[5148.16 → 5149.90] I was actually
[5149.90 → 5150.76] Chatting with
[5150.76 → 5151.90] One of the employees
[5151.90 → 5153.14] At Smash Champs
[5153.14 → 5153.60] Raj
[5153.60 → 5154.28] He was in one of the
[5154.28 → 5154.52] Tours
[5154.52 → 5155.48] And he's
[5155.48 → 5156.34] He's a pretty big
[5156.34 → 5157.08] AMD guy
[5157.08 → 5158.82] He treated himself
[5158.82 → 5159.26] To
[5159.26 → 5161.04] I think he had
[5161.04 → 5162.48] A 7900 XT
[5162.48 → 5163.02] And then he actually
[5163.02 → 5164.24] Went 9070 XT
[5164.24 → 5165.02] If I recall correctly
[5165.02 → 5165.54] Sorry Raj
[5165.54 → 5166.08] If I'm getting this
[5166.08 → 5166.28] Wrong
[5166.28 → 5167.52] But basically
[5167.52 → 5168.04] He was
[5168.04 → 5169.00] He was pretty
[5169.00 → 5169.60] Miffed
[5169.60 → 5170.42] Even though he
[5170.42 → 5171.60] Has a 9000 series
[5171.60 → 5172.02] Card
[5172.02 → 5173.74] That AMD's
[5173.74 → 5174.44] Because he's
[5174.44 → 5175.06] Like he's kind of
[5175.06 → 5175.96] He's rooting for them
[5175.96 → 5176.22] You know
[5176.22 → 5177.68] And he was kind of
[5177.68 → 5178.30] Miffed that
[5178.30 → 5179.72] AMD was kind of
[5179.72 → 5180.54] Leaving behind
[5180.54 → 5181.60] Their non
[5181.60 → 5182.98] RDNA 4 customers
[5182.98 → 5183.92] With this feature
[5183.92 → 5184.50] Announcement
[5184.50 → 5185.52] And I was like
[5185.52 → 5186.62] Yeah that's a
[5186.62 → 5187.70] That's a fair point
[5187.70 → 5188.02] Raj
[5188.02 → 5189.16] But as much as
[5189.16 → 5190.08] AMD has
[5190.08 → 5191.40] Made a solid effort
[5191.40 → 5192.00] To have their
[5192.00 → 5192.48] Products
[5192.48 → 5193.16] You know
[5193.16 → 5194.34] Aged like fine wine
[5194.34 → 5195.44] With driver support
[5195.44 → 5196.42] And feature updates
[5196.42 → 5199.02] The old cards
[5199.02 → 5200.82] Just don't have
[5200.82 → 5203.60] The AI processing
[5203.60 → 5204.18] On board
[5204.18 → 5204.74] So
[5204.74 → 5206.14] There's only so much
[5206.14 → 5207.04] You can really do
[5207.04 → 5208.06] Nvidia was
[5208.06 → 5209.58] Way ahead of them
[5209.58 → 5210.44] In terms of
[5210.44 → 5211.56] Implementing neural
[5211.56 → 5212.38] Processors
[5212.38 → 5213.58] On their GPUs
[5213.58 → 5214.44] So there's nothing
[5214.44 → 5215.30] That you can really
[5215.30 → 5216.78] Do about that
[5216.78 → 5218.18] And you can
[5218.18 → 5219.28] You could kind of
[5219.28 → 5219.60] Try to
[5219.60 → 5220.26] You could kind of
[5220.26 → 5220.86] Try to flub it
[5220.86 → 5221.38] With your more
[5221.38 → 5222.20] General compute
[5222.20 → 5223.96] But then you're
[5223.96 → 5224.68] Taking away
[5224.68 → 5225.36] From
[5225.36 → 5227.26] The base
[5227.26 → 5227.78] Performance
[5227.78 → 5228.24] That you're
[5228.24 → 5228.84] Trying to
[5228.84 → 5229.54] Upscale
[5229.54 → 5230.26] And frame
[5230.26 → 5231.00] Generate from
[5231.00 → 5232.28] So
[5232.28 → 5233.18] That's
[5233.18 → 5233.98] That's pretty
[5233.98 → 5234.60] That's pretty
[5234.60 → 5234.92] Tough
[5234.92 → 5235.42] You end up
[5235.42 → 5236.06] Robbing your
[5236.06 → 5236.68] Left pocket
[5236.68 → 5237.18] In order to
[5237.18 → 5237.46] Pay your
[5237.46 → 5238.04] Right pocket
[5238.04 → 5240.94] So yeah
[5240.94 → 5241.44] Downer
[5241.44 → 5243.18] But
[5243.18 → 5246.36] I guess
[5246.36 → 5246.68] It's cool
[5246.68 → 5247.20] For people who
[5247.20 → 5247.88] Have a 9070
[5247.88 → 5248.50] Or a 9070
[5248.50 → 5248.86] XT
[5248.86 → 5249.64] Or a 90
[5249.64 → 5250.80] 60 series
[5250.80 → 5251.08] I guess
[5251.08 → 5252.46] Cool
[5252.46 → 5253.42] Good chat
[5253.42 → 5254.84] You want to
[5254.84 → 5255.14] Talk about
[5255.14 → 5255.50] Next
[5255.50 → 5258.96] You want to
[5258.96 → 5259.48] Do this thing
[5259.48 → 5260.18] Pebbles founder
[5260.18 → 5261.00] Introduces a
[5261.00 → 5261.58] $75
[5261.58 → 5263.12] AI smart ring
[5263.12 → 5263.48] Yeah
[5263.48 → 5264.44] It's less
[5264.44 → 5265.00] Stupid than
[5265.00 → 5265.50] It sounds
[5265.50 → 5266.28] And
[5266.28 → 5267.00] And I'm
[5267.00 → 5267.18] Going to
[5267.18 → 5267.60] Tell you a
[5267.60 → 5268.10] Couple things
[5268.10 → 5268.68] That aren't
[5268.68 → 5269.32] In the notes
[5269.32 → 5270.14] That are
[5270.14 → 5270.40] Going to
[5270.40 → 5270.74] Make it
[5270.74 → 5271.04] Sound
[5271.04 → 5272.06] Really stupid
[5272.06 → 5272.78] Oh
[5272.78 → 5273.28] It has
[5273.28 → 5274.10] A literally
[5274.10 → 5275.02] Not only
[5275.02 → 5275.92] Non-replaceable
[5275.92 → 5276.28] Battery
[5276.28 → 5278.50] A non-rechargeable
[5278.50 → 5278.88] Battery
[5278.88 → 5284.62] It has a
[5284.62 → 5285.22] Microphone
[5285.22 → 5286.24] Because of
[5286.24 → 5286.54] Course it
[5286.54 → 5286.82] Does
[5286.82 → 5288.92] And
[5288.92 → 5290.88] Let's see
[5290.88 → 5291.20] What else
[5291.20 → 5291.64] Can I tell
[5291.64 → 5291.90] You that
[5291.90 → 5292.20] Will make
[5292.20 → 5292.62] You hate
[5292.62 → 5292.82] It
[5292.82 → 5294.42] Let me
[5294.42 → 5294.74] Think
[5294.74 → 5297.22] It has
[5297.22 → 5298.18] A non-replaceable
[5298.18 → 5298.50] Battery
[5298.50 → 5298.80] I already
[5298.80 → 5299.36] Got that
[5299.36 → 5301.00] What's
[5301.00 → 5301.56] Something that
[5301.56 → 5302.06] You might
[5302.06 → 5302.64] Like hate
[5302.64 → 5303.12] About it
[5303.12 → 5304.32] I mean
[5304.32 → 5304.52] Yeah
[5304.52 → 5305.46] I don't
[5305.46 → 5305.84] Like the
[5305.84 → 5306.46] Non-rechargeable
[5306.46 → 5306.70] Battery
[5306.70 → 5306.98] That's
[5306.98 → 5307.28] Already
[5307.28 → 5307.90] Ridiculous
[5307.90 → 5308.12] Yeah
[5308.12 → 5308.38] Okay
[5308.38 → 5308.74] I
[5308.74 → 5309.62] Okay
[5309.62 → 5309.96] But I'll
[5309.96 → 5310.18] Tell you
[5310.18 → 5310.42] The good
[5310.42 → 5310.66] Things
[5310.66 → 5310.90] Now
[5310.90 → 5311.98] Okay
[5311.98 → 5312.32] Okay
[5312.32 → 5312.84] I love
[5312.84 → 5313.86] All right
[5313.86 → 5314.12] Let's
[5314.12 → 5314.50] Just talk
[5314.50 → 5314.72] About it
[5314.72 → 5314.86] Yeah
[5314.86 → 5315.18] So the
[5315.18 → 5316.62] Non-rechargeable
[5316.62 → 5317.02] Battery
[5317.02 → 5318.72] The non-replaceable
[5318.72 → 5319.32] Non-rechargeable
[5319.32 → 5319.58] Battery
[5319.58 → 5319.94] Apparently
[5319.94 → 5320.16] It'll
[5320.16 → 5320.34] Last
[5320.34 → 5320.60] For a
[5320.60 → 5320.80] Couple
[5320.80 → 5320.96] Of
[5320.96 → 5321.30] Years
[5321.30 → 5322.22] They
[5322.22 → 5322.42] Have
[5322.42 → 5322.92] Already
[5322.92 → 5323.94] Telegraphed
[5323.94 → 5324.02] That
[5324.02 → 5324.28] Still
[5324.28 → 5324.62] Sucks
[5324.62 → 5324.80] But
[5324.80 → 5325.00] Okay
[5325.00 → 5325.16] They
[5325.16 → 5325.30] Have
[5325.30 → 5325.60] Already
[5325.60 → 5326.38] Telegraphed
[5326.38 → 5326.92] That
[5326.92 → 5327.10] They
[5327.10 → 5327.32] Will
[5327.32 → 5327.68] Put
[5327.68 → 5327.90] A
[5327.90 → 5328.36] Recycling
[5328.36 → 5328.72] Program
[5328.72 → 5328.98] In
[5328.98 → 5329.34] Place
[5329.34 → 5330.10] So that
[5330.10 → 5330.20] You
[5330.20 → 5330.34] Can
[5330.34 → 5330.56] Return
[5330.56 → 5330.70] The
[5330.70 → 5330.84] Ring
[5330.84 → 5332.18] Telegraphed
[5332.18 → 5332.68] Said
[5332.68 → 5332.84] They
[5332.84 → 5333.02] Will
[5333.02 → 5333.42] Okay
[5333.42 → 5335.26] I
[5335.26 → 5335.50] Do
[5335.50 → 5335.82] Still
[5335.82 → 5336.08] Think
[5336.08 → 5336.36] That's
[5336.36 → 5336.58] Kind
[5336.58 → 5336.66] Of
[5336.66 → 5336.96] BS
[5336.96 → 5337.28] Because
[5337.28 → 5337.66] The
[5337.66 → 5338.00] Odds
[5338.00 → 5338.18] Of
[5338.18 → 5338.86] Like
[5338.86 → 5339.06] Me
[5339.06 → 5339.22] I'm
[5339.22 → 5339.34] Just
[5339.34 → 5339.52] Thinking
[5339.52 → 5339.70] For
[5339.70 → 5340.06] Myself
[5340.06 → 5340.26] Here
[5340.26 → 5340.42] The
[5340.42 → 5340.74] Odds
[5340.74 → 5340.90] Of
[5340.90 → 5341.14] Me
[5341.14 → 5341.46] Going
[5341.46 → 5341.60] To
[5341.60 → 5341.74] The
[5341.74 → 5342.12] Effort
[5342.12 → 5343.08] To
[5343.08 → 5343.78] Return
[5343.78 → 5343.92] It
[5343.92 → 5344.04] To
[5344.04 → 5344.24] Them
[5344.24 → 5344.56] Even
[5344.56 → 5344.74] If
[5344.74 → 5344.84] They
[5344.84 → 5344.96] Were
[5344.96 → 5345.08] To
[5345.08 → 5345.30] Cover
[5345.30 → 5345.60] Shipping
[5345.60 → 5345.82] Back
[5345.82 → 5345.94] To
[5345.94 → 5346.02] Them
[5346.02 → 5346.16] Which
[5346.16 → 5346.30] I
[5346.30 → 5346.76] Sincerely
[5346.76 → 5346.98] Doubt
[5346.98 → 5347.12] They
[5347.12 → 5347.32] Would
[5347.32 → 5347.78] The
[5347.78 → 5348.16] Odds
[5348.16 → 5348.26] Of
[5348.26 → 5348.34] Me
[5348.34 → 5348.68] Bothering
[5348.68 → 5348.84] To

[5348.98 → 5349.20] That
[5359.34 → 5359.52] Long
[5359.52 → 5359.76] Like
[5359.76 → 5359.98] It's
[5359.98 → 5360.28] Like
[5360.28 → 5361.50] Thick
[5361.50 → 5363.26] That
[5363.26 → 5363.40] Are
[5363.40 → 5363.92] Pending
[5363.92 → 5364.54] Next
[5364.54 → 5364.82] Time
[5364.82 → 5365.08] I

[5365.24 → 5365.44] Going
[5365.44 → 5365.62] To
[5365.62 → 5366.08] Ikea
[5366.08 → 5366.48] And
[5366.48 → 5366.60] I
[5366.60 → 5367.02] Remember
[5367.02 → 5367.24] To
[5367.24 → 5367.38] Bring
[5367.38 → 5367.58] My
[5367.58 → 5368.16] Batteries

[5369.22 → 5369.34] Their
[5369.34 → 5369.66] Battery
[5369.66 → 5370.00] Shoot
[5370.00 → 5370.84] I
[5370.84 → 5371.22] Think
[5371.22 → 5371.50] I've
[5371.50 → 5371.72] Had
[5371.72 → 5371.86] It
[5371.86 → 5372.06] For
[5372.06 → 5372.64] About
[5372.64 → 5373.24] Six
[5373.24 → 5373.72] Years
[5373.72 → 5374.08] Now
[5374.08 → 5378.64] There
[5378.64 → 5378.82] Is

[5381.44 → 5381.62] It

[5549.54 → 5549.70] Years
[5549.70 → 5549.82] If
[5549.82 → 5549.86] I
[5549.86 → 5549.94] Could
[5549.94 → 5550.08] Just
[5550.08 → 5550.40] Charge
[5550.40 → 5550.60] It
[5550.60 → 5551.92] Or

[5552.28 → 5552.42] The
[5552.42 → 5552.66] Battery

[5556.92 → 5557.04] Can
[5557.04 → 5557.36] Understand
[5557.36 → 5557.72] That

[5559.04 → 5559.26] Smart
[5559.26 → 5559.52] Ring
[5559.52 → 5560.16] Would
[5560.16 → 5560.48] Probably
[5560.48 → 5560.80] Add
[5560.80 → 5560.92] A
[5560.92 → 5561.34] Significant
[5561.34 → 5561.56] Amount
[5561.56 → 5561.70] Of

[5564.92 → 5565.16] Says
[5565.16 → 5565.40] There
[5565.40 → 5565.56] Is
[5565.56 → 5565.76] Some
[5565.76 → 5566.28] Nuance
[5566.28 → 5566.50] To

[5567.44 → 5567.74] Thing
[5567.74 → 5568.44] And
[5568.44 → 5568.64] There
[5568.64 → 5568.86] Were
[5568.86 → 5570.00] Tradeoffs
[5570.00 → 5570.68] That
[5570.68 → 5570.84] Were
[5570.84 → 5571.10] Made
[5571.10 → 5571.38] It
[5571.38 → 5571.52] Was
[5571.52 → 5571.66] An
[5571.66 → 5572.14] Engineering
[5572.14 → 5572.82] Tradeoff
[5572.82 → 5573.56] So
[5573.56 → 5574.38] Duly

[5582.36 → 5582.86] Would
[5582.86 → 5583.32] Say

[5587.14 → 5587.56] Tradeoff
[5587.56 → 5587.86] Okay
[5587.86 → 5588.50] So
[5588.50 → 5588.92] Someone
[5588.92 → 5589.02] In
[5589.02 → 5589.14] Chat

[5589.68 → 5589.80] Are
[5589.80 → 5589.98] Very
[5589.98 → 5590.40] Valid
[5590.40 → 5590.70] That
[5590.70 → 5591.82] Yeah
[5591.82 → 5592.16] But
[5592.16 → 5592.48] I
[5592.48 → 5592.66] Mean
[5592.66 → 5592.92] There's
[5592.92 → 5593.36] Also
[5593.36 → 5595.32] Okay
[5595.32 → 5596.30] I
[5596.30 → 5596.48] Wonder
[5596.48 → 5596.64] What
[5596.64 → 5596.74] The

[5608.38 → 5608.52] In
[5608.52 → 5608.72] Terms
[5608.72 → 5608.82] Of

[5609.30 → 5609.50] Will
[5609.50 → 5609.80] Bear

[5611.84 → 5612.72] You
[5612.72 → 5612.84] Know
[5612.84 → 5613.06] It
[5613.06 → 5613.64] It
[5613.64 → 5613.86] Could
[5613.86 → 5614.22] Be

[5618.46 → 5618.74] Times
[5618.74 → 5619.08] Longer
[5619.08 → 5619.22] But
[5619.22 → 5619.48] Cost
[5619.48 → 5619.72] Twice
[5619.72 → 5619.90] As

[5620.08 → 5620.26] Would
[5620.26 → 5620.36] Be

[5624.36 → 5624.50] As
[5624.50 → 5624.72] Much
[5624.72 → 5624.94] But
[5624.94 → 5625.22] Last
[5625.22 → 5625.44] One

[5628.84 → 5628.96] Know
[5628.96 → 5629.18] You're
[5629.18 → 5629.48] It's
[5629.48 → 5629.70] Sort of
[5629.70 → 5629.84] You're
[5629.84 → 5630.20] Bound
[5630.20 → 5630.44] By

[5630.82 → 5631.30] Forces
[5631.30 → 5632.02] I
[5632.02 → 5632.20] Think
[5632.20 → 5632.36] It's
[5632.36 → 5632.46] A
[5632.46 → 5632.68] Cop

[5632.98 → 5633.14] Think
[5633.14 → 5633.28] You
[5633.28 → 5633.40] Should
[5633.40 → 5633.76] Build
[5633.76 → 5633.94] High
[5633.94 → 5634.26] Quality

[5634.62 → 5634.82] That
[5634.82 → 5635.06] Last
[5635.06 → 5635.16] A
[5635.16 → 5635.32] Really
[5635.32 → 5635.56] Long
[5635.56 → 5635.84] Time
[5635.84 → 5636.04] People
[5636.04 → 5636.14] Are
[5636.14 → 5636.30] Saying
[5636.30 → 5636.46] It's
[5636.46 → 5636.92] Brightness
[5636.92 → 5637.42] Versus
[5637.42 → 5637.94] Lifetime
[5637.94 → 5638.04] Of
[5654.12 → 5654.28] Maybe
[5654.28 → 5655.12] Maybe
[5655.12 → 5655.30] A
[5655.30 → 5655.42] Bit
[5655.42 → 5655.52] Of
[5655.52 → 5655.62] A
[5655.62 → 5656.16] Scapegoat
[5656.16 → 5656.60] Because
[5656.60 → 5656.76] There
[5656.76 → 5656.88] Are
[5656.88 → 5657.22] Modern
[5657.22 → 5657.54] LED
[5657.54 → 5658.30] Lights
[5658.30 → 5659.14] That
[5659.14 → 5659.40] Are
[5659.40 → 5660.90] Incredibly
[5660.90 → 5661.28] Bright
[5661.28 → 5661.60] And
[5661.60 → 5661.82] It's
[5661.82 → 5662.20] Definitely
[5662.20 → 5662.98] Unnecessary
[5662.98 → 5664.10] Um
[5664.10 → 5664.58] Probably
[5664.58 → 5664.92] Be
[5664.92 → 5665.18] Chill
[5665.18 → 5665.34] If
[5665.34 → 5665.44] They
[5665.44 → 5665.64] Just
[5665.64 → 5666.02] Lasted
[5666.02 → 5666.10] A
[5666.10 → 5666.22] Lot
[5666.22 → 5666.52] Longer
[5666.52 → 5666.64] And

[5667.10 → 5667.30] Bright
[5667.30 → 5668.04] Yeah
[5668.04 → 5668.82] So
[5668.82 → 5668.92] It
[5668.92 → 5669.08] Does
[5669.08 → 5669.28] Seem
[5669.28 → 5669.46] Like
[5669.46 → 5669.60] There
[5669.60 → 5669.80] May
[5669.80 → 5669.92] Be

[5674.18 → 5674.38] Is
[5674.38 → 5674.80] Super
[5674.80 → 5675.16] Based
[5675.16 → 5675.56] So
[5675.56 → 5676.04] Yeah
[5676.04 → 5676.24] I
[5676.24 → 5676.54] Have
[5684.12 → 5685.94] I
[5685.94 → 5686.20] Didn't

[5697.54 → 5698.34] Be
[5698.34 → 5698.74] Illegal
[5698.74 → 5700.34] It's
[5700.34 → 5700.60] Like

[5863.60 → 5863.88] Yellow
[5863.88 → 5864.24] Rope
[5864.24 → 5864.46] So

[5864.84 → 5865.20] The

[5883.32 → 5883.46] Two

[7782.42 → 7782.80] Page
[7782.80 → 7783.16] Reddit

[7791.04 → 7791.20] The
[7791.20 → 7791.54] Odds
[7791.54 → 7791.78] If
[7791.78 → 7791.96] You
[7791.96 → 7792.16] Went
[7792.16 → 7792.34] To
[7792.34 → 7792.50] The

[7795.48 → 7795.62] To
[7795.62 → 7796.06] Somebody
[7796.06 → 7796.30] There
[7796.30 → 7796.48] That
[7796.48 → 7796.58] They
[7796.58 → 7796.90] Have
[7796.90 → 7799.04] Any idea
[7799.04 → 7799.48] About
[7799.48 → 7799.90] Any of
[7799.90 → 7800.06] It
[7800.06 → 7800.50] Yeah
[7800.50 → 7800.70] It's
[7800.70 → 7801.60] Functionally
[7801.60 → 7802.04] Zero
[7802.04 → 7802.36] As
[7802.36 → 7802.60] Someone
[7802.60 → 7802.76] Who
[7802.76 → 7803.08] Is
[7803.08 → 7804.06] Tries
[7804.06 → 7804.24] To
[7804.24 → 7804.42] Not
[7804.42 → 7804.54] Be
[7804.54 → 7804.70] But
[7804.70 → 7804.84] Is
[7804.84 → 7804.94] A
[7804.94 → 7834.94] 
[7834.94 → 7836.28] father
[7836.28 → 7848.52] Dis
[7848.52 → 7849.16] Pulled
[7849.16 → 7850.88] They're just like, oh, I love Harry Potter.
[7851.34 → 7852.20] Like, they don't know about any of that.
[7852.20 → 7853.58] They probably have no clue what's going on.
[7853.60 → 7854.50] You know, I talked to their parents.
[7855.12 → 7857.92] Like, oh, yeah, your kid says they like Harry Potter.
[7858.02 → 7859.06] They're like, oh, yeah, Harry Potter.
[7859.24 → 7860.98] You know, the lightning bolt thing.
[7861.50 → 7862.40] You know, with the scarf, right?
[7862.82 → 7864.42] Like, they don't care.
[7864.50 → 7865.40] They don't know they don't care.
[7865.40 → 7865.74] Yeah.
[7866.48 → 7867.76] There are other things going on.
[7867.92 → 7870.10] They got other things to care about.
[7871.26 → 7873.84] And it's interesting.
[7874.62 → 7874.78] Yeah.
[7874.90 → 7877.66] Angry Panda PC says, but I am important.
[7877.78 → 7878.54] And I agree.
[7878.54 → 7879.94] I agree you're important.
[7880.04 → 7880.78] Everyone's important.
[7881.16 → 7883.92] But not everyone is important to everyone else.
[7884.04 → 7885.26] Here's another weird thing.
[7885.38 → 7891.62] Even if you are chronically online, these days, it doesn't even necessarily matter that much
[7891.62 → 7900.46] because your feeds are so heavily algorithmic that you probably still are out of the loop
[7900.46 → 7902.24] on so many things.
[7902.24 → 7908.44] Because, like, I remember someone, there was a thread on Reddit recently about how YouTube
[7908.44 → 7910.24] unlisted all of their rewinds.
[7911.32 → 7911.56] Yeah.
[7912.24 → 7917.62] And it's like, yeah, I remember being on YouTube back in the day.
[7917.62 → 7922.74] And, like, if there was something big happening on YouTube, as someone who went to YouTube,
[7922.90 → 7924.06] you would just know that?
[7925.28 → 7931.30] But now, we were talking before the show, there was a creator in our space with over a million
[7931.30 → 7933.08] subscribers that neither of us had ever heard of.
[7933.18 → 7933.28] Yeah.
[7933.28 → 7937.96] Because they made a type of content in our space that we just wouldn't happen to come
[7937.96 → 7938.30] across.
[7938.68 → 7942.60] Alyssa Jean Puppy says, if a person behind a franchise spends all her money on wanting
[7942.60 → 7945.82] to stop making me exist, I think boycotting is really the least you could do.
[7946.22 → 7946.52] My point...
[7946.52 → 7947.46] We're not saying anything about that.
[7947.46 → 7949.08] My point wasn't what people should or shouldn't do.
[7949.16 → 7950.42] My point was that they don't know.
[7950.66 → 7950.96] Yes.
[7951.30 → 7952.22] That is the only point.
[7952.22 → 7955.52] You can't care about something that you literally don't know.
[7955.62 → 7955.80] Yeah.
[7956.24 → 7963.82] And I think that we often live in echo chambers and in communities where the issues that are
[7963.82 → 7969.64] very important to us, like, oh man, like, what would be an example that would be like
[7969.64 → 7971.12] a really tech community?
[7971.28 → 7975.78] Like, okay, what percentage of people, if you went to the mall, right, and you went and
[7975.78 → 7981.68] talked to somebody, what percentage of people there would know that DDR memory is expensive?
[7982.00 → 7982.14] Yeah.
[7982.86 → 7984.46] And the impact of that on the world.
[7984.58 → 7987.82] Of the ones who knew what percentage of them would be impacted?
[7988.26 → 7990.18] Like, out of computer enthusiasm...
[7990.18 → 7992.48] So you've got your total population, right?
[7992.76 → 7994.98] Then you've got your, like, tech enthusiast bubble.
[7995.44 → 7999.54] And then within that bubble, you've got the people who are actually shopping for a new
[7999.54 → 8002.24] computer right now, who are actually spending money right now.
[8002.72 → 8005.24] And then, like, that's it.
[8005.24 → 8008.28] It's this tiny little fraction.
[8009.54 → 8017.18] And so, yeah, there's people who are very mad, who are following this whole AI thing.
[8017.76 → 8020.96] And particularly, you know, generative AI video.
[8021.54 → 8027.96] And out of that, the people who sort of care about the replacement of labour of the, you know,
[8027.96 → 8033.04] the cinematographers and the actors and the writers and all the people who would have
[8033.04 → 8034.16] otherwise worked on this.
[8035.22 → 8038.74] And I think it's just like, yeah, you could probably easily find...
[8038.74 → 8039.60] What did that video...
[8039.60 → 8040.88] What did that top comment have?
[8040.96 → 8041.90] Like, 20,000...
[8041.90 → 8042.66] 22,000.
[8042.76 → 8043.06] 22,000 upvotes.
[8043.22 → 8043.32] Yeah.
[8043.48 → 8045.08] Those 22,000 people.
[8045.34 → 8046.14] They matter.
[8046.14 → 8050.16] Those are living, breathing souls with blood coursing through their veins.
[8050.40 → 8052.94] They're also an incredibly tiny percentage of the global population.
[8054.22 → 8059.92] Alyssa Jean Puppy, hopefully I said that right, said in Full Plane Chat, okay, but J. K. Rowling
[8059.92 → 8061.46] is all over the news about that.
[8062.34 → 8063.32] At least in the UK.
[8063.32 → 8065.38] Which is just another version.
[8066.42 → 8069.72] She's not over here because she's not from over here.
[8069.84 → 8070.78] She's from over there.
[8071.00 → 8073.66] And she's not trying to influence legislation over here.
[8073.74 → 8076.22] And we're aware because we're terminally online.
[8076.50 → 8076.64] Yeah.
[8076.92 → 8078.32] But in...
[8078.32 → 8081.60] But you've got a geographical filter.
[8081.80 → 8082.60] We're not trying...
[8082.60 → 8084.58] Then you've got a keeps up with the news filter.
[8085.04 → 8087.32] Then you've got a cares about this issue filter.
[8087.82 → 8090.32] And then you've got an even remembers it filter.
[8090.32 → 8091.32] There's just...
[8091.32 → 8096.96] There are so many layers until you get down to what can be a very large number of people.
[8097.50 → 8099.44] Especially over the last decent amount of years.
[8100.52 → 8104.00] There's been a lot of difficulty going around.
[8105.14 → 8105.64] And...
[8105.64 → 8106.64] Yeah.
[8106.88 → 8110.30] People might be struggling to survive at all themselves.
[8110.60 → 8115.28] And the issues that applied very directly to them is going to be what's important to them
[8115.28 → 8116.40] when that is...
[8116.40 → 8118.52] When they're fighting for survival all the time.
[8118.52 → 8121.38] They have to deal with their own problems, right?
[8121.42 → 8122.64] They have to put their mask on first.
[8122.74 → 8123.34] And it's...
[8123.34 → 8123.98] It's tough.
[8124.10 → 8124.52] But like...
[8125.90 → 8126.52] Cato-issue asks...
[8127.16 → 8130.30] So then do people outside the US think Elon Musk is great then?
[8131.24 → 8134.82] A lot of people think Elon Musk is pretty great.
[8135.86 → 8138.10] That's the whole point we're trying to make.
[8138.38 → 8138.58] Or just...
[8138.58 → 8139.22] Don't care.
[8139.80 → 8140.06] Yes.
[8140.06 → 8140.56] At all.
[8141.08 → 8142.50] Or just don't care at all.
[8143.06 → 8143.50] Yeah.
[8144.14 → 8144.58] Yes.
[8145.20 → 8146.60] The answer is yes.
[8146.60 → 8150.08] I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
[8150.34 → 8152.78] There's an incredible amount of people in the world that don't even know who he is.
[8153.28 → 8153.72] Yes.
[8154.86 → 8155.74] That's a thing.
[8156.84 → 8157.40] I know.
[8157.50 → 8159.20] It seems crazy, right?
[8159.30 → 8160.38] In our tech sphere.
[8161.22 → 8161.44] Right?
[8161.58 → 8166.96] How could anyone in the tech sphere not have heard of the techno king as he self-proclaimed
[8166.96 → 8169.14] himself to be a number of years back, right?
[8169.90 → 8172.48] In D260 said there are idiots through the whole world.
[8172.82 → 8174.16] We're not saying they're idiots.
[8174.64 → 8174.88] No.
[8175.90 → 8177.52] That's not what we're saying at all.
[8178.68 → 8179.84] Some of them might be.
[8180.84 → 8182.64] The fact is that education is a problem?
[8182.86 → 8183.18] No.
[8184.46 → 8184.86] No.
[8185.00 → 8186.32] That's not what we're saying at all.
[8186.32 → 8191.58] We're saying that there's a whole wide world out there with many, many interests and many,
[8191.72 → 8194.52] many priorities and not everybody shares them.
[8194.96 → 8199.36] And in this algorithmically curated world that we live in.
[8199.60 → 8201.16] You might literally just never see it.
[8201.42 → 8201.96] And we may.
[8202.18 → 8206.94] And that is in a lot of ways by design on the platforms.
[8207.06 → 8212.62] Like what percentage of Subreddits that exist do you imagine you've been personally exposed
[8212.62 → 8213.06] to?
[8213.06 → 8218.16] Like, dude, I've been kind of hooked on r slash all over the last like week.
[8218.34 → 8220.50] I try not to get too into the Reddit black hole.
[8220.74 → 8221.30] R slash what?
[8221.44 → 8221.62] All.
[8222.00 → 8222.20] Oh.
[8222.30 → 8222.98] Just like, just like.
[8223.26 → 8228.00] And it's just like, it is realistically like a handful.
[8228.18 → 8229.12] Am I the asshole?
[8233.82 → 8236.02] PCMR shows up there every once in a while.
[8236.30 → 8238.02] Comics shows up a fair bit.
[8238.02 → 8245.58] There's like, it's probably over the span of a week, several dozen Subreddits that contribute
[8245.58 → 8252.48] to the majority of the like vastly uploaded or upvoted content on the site.
[8253.36 → 8256.48] But there are, what are, what is it up to?
[8256.60 → 8257.12] Tens of thousands?
[8257.26 → 8258.14] Hundreds of thousands?
[8258.54 → 8259.18] I have no idea.
[8259.38 → 8260.30] Are we at millions of Subreddits?
[8260.36 → 8261.78] How many Subreddits are there?
[8261.78 → 8266.60] 3.8 million.
[8268.18 → 8272.22] What percentage of them do you think you've been exposed to?
[8272.22 → 8272.32] As of 11 months ago.
[8272.56 → 8274.36] 3.8 million as of 11 months ago.
[8274.96 → 8281.72] So, and yeah, Len, Len, oh, or however I pronounce this in Flow plane chat says, you all just got
[8281.72 → 8282.56] to ignore this stuff.
[8282.82 → 8285.10] I never get to see it, and I'm so happy I don't have to.
[8285.16 → 8286.86] My feed is just cool stuff and DIY.
[8286.86 → 8288.46] And that's also like, it is a.
[8288.54 → 8290.28] And that's exactly our point.
[8290.28 → 8295.54] For people that are terminally online, it is somewhat surprising to hear that a ton of
[8295.54 → 8301.08] people have recognized that being constantly dialled into everything that is happening in
[8301.08 → 8306.04] the world and how the fact that the further we move away from local news, and we move closer
[8306.04 → 8310.76] to global news and like back in the day, you could have a newspaper that's talking about
[8310.76 → 8312.60] like the fair that's happening in town.
[8312.60 → 8317.42] So there isn't going to be all that much really horrible things because you're centralized
[8317.42 → 8318.34] to a smaller area.
[8318.46 → 8319.78] That was a different kind of bubble.
[8319.94 → 8321.28] It was a more geographical bubble.
[8321.44 → 8321.62] Yeah.
[8321.82 → 8324.88] When you're now looking at more global news, and you look at the news that's going to float
[8324.88 → 8330.50] to the top, it's going to be the most rage baiting, crazy, horrible things possible because
[8330.50 → 8331.86] that's what's going to get more views.
[8332.02 → 8336.56] So you're only going to get news about all the most horrible possible things happening.
[8336.56 → 8339.60] And it's terrible in a lot of ways for your brain.
[8339.70 → 8344.86] That doesn't mean that not being that dialled in is, for example, an education problem or
[8344.86 → 8347.00] an ignorance problem or being stupid.
[8347.26 → 8350.46] I mean, it's literally an ignorance problem, but maybe not a problem.
[8350.54 → 8351.38] It literally is ignorance.
[8351.72 → 8352.50] Negatively.
[8352.56 → 8352.74] Yeah.
[8353.00 → 8355.22] It might be ignorance, but not necessarily an ignorance problem.
[8355.54 → 8359.58] To certain people, they don't want to be exposed to that pipeline of extreme constant
[8359.58 → 8361.98] negativity because it can be bad for you.
[8361.98 → 8365.26] Or it's just, you know, they got other stuff going on.
[8366.36 → 8368.56] I76969Hex says people should be informed.
[8370.32 → 8371.72] Noble sentiment.
[8372.06 → 8373.46] How many things do you not know about?
[8373.64 → 8374.48] You're speaking English.
[8374.60 → 8376.28] Do you know everything that's happening in China right now?
[8377.76 → 8378.46] I don't.
[8378.88 → 8379.18] Like.
[8379.74 → 8381.94] I know Hassan's Billy stream got turned off.
[8382.68 → 8383.12] Sure.
[8383.92 → 8384.14] Sure.
[8385.20 → 8385.84] Do you know?
[8385.96 → 8386.32] Like, yeah.
[8386.46 → 8386.68] Do you?
[8386.84 → 8387.54] I don't know.
[8387.64 → 8389.38] There are so many layers to that.
[8389.38 → 8393.62] And like your level of knowledge does not mean that everyone else's level of knowledge
[8393.62 → 8394.34] is inferior.
[8394.82 → 8395.20] It's.
[8395.90 → 8401.22] There are an incredible amount of things that I know nothing about that I'm sure are incredibly
[8401.22 → 8401.76] important.
[8402.88 → 8404.30] And I have no clue.
[8405.58 → 8406.00] Yeah.
[8406.16 → 8412.52] And again, like we're not trying to argue that that's the way it should be.
[8413.14 → 8414.26] That ain't the argument.
[8414.26 → 8419.44] We're just pointing out that that is how it is.
[8420.14 → 8425.02] Not everyone cares about AI or AI slop or.
[8425.22 → 8425.62] Yeah.
[8425.70 → 8425.86] Dude.
[8425.94 → 8430.72] The amount of people that are just totally ignoring and don't care about that at all.
[8430.98 → 8431.42] Super high.
[8431.50 → 8432.22] Very high.
[8432.36 → 8435.12] And the number of people who are like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8435.12 → 8435.70] Let's go.
[8436.26 → 8437.18] Also very high.
[8437.30 → 8437.54] Yes.
[8437.54 → 8441.14] And that is fact.
[8443.32 → 8443.76] Sorry.
[8445.92 → 8446.36] Yeah.
[8446.92 → 8449.02] Am I going to have to do a shirt over this?
[8450.14 → 8450.58] Sorry.
[8450.72 → 8452.54] AI is a thing like I.
[8457.44 → 8459.18] Because I'll do a shirt.
[8459.56 → 8460.42] I don't mind.
[8460.96 → 8461.46] I could do.
[8461.54 → 8462.24] Trust me, bro.
[8462.36 → 8463.40] AI is a thing.
[8465.18 → 8465.62] Hashtag.
[8466.36 → 8467.32] Ad block is piracy.
[8468.04 → 8468.84] Just we'll come by.
[8468.96 → 8469.86] We'll come by.
[8470.06 → 8471.78] Come by all the scandals.
[8472.04 → 8476.36] It's like, sorry, the things that you do know are probably less important than the myriads
[8476.36 → 8477.32] of things that you don't.
[8477.88 → 8478.24] Ooh.
[8480.52 → 8480.96] Wow.
[8481.08 → 8481.74] That's a.
[8484.20 → 8484.64] Okay.
[8484.72 → 8485.38] In other news.
[8486.14 → 8487.90] What the heck is this?
[8488.86 → 8491.24] Facebook and malware bites.
[8491.64 → 8492.04] Okay.
[8492.36 → 8494.92] I recorded this on my computer.
[8496.02 → 8496.50] Okay.
[8496.50 → 8496.94] I.
[8498.56 → 8499.26] Here we go.
[8499.46 → 8501.80] So I got my OBS interface here.
[8501.92 → 8502.34] There we go.
[8503.10 → 8505.32] I got this email from Facebook.
[8506.02 → 8506.38] Okay.
[8506.42 → 8508.20] And I was a little irritated.
[8508.46 → 8508.78] Wow.
[8508.84 → 8509.68] This quality though.
[8509.80 → 8510.60] This is really blurry.
[8510.86 → 8511.64] One moment, please.
[8512.02 → 8512.38] Seriously.
[8512.48 → 8514.10] It's actually not just my eyes this time.
[8514.36 → 8514.92] There we go.
[8515.38 → 8515.72] Okay.
[8515.80 → 8516.04] Okay.
[8516.12 → 8517.32] Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[8517.32 → 8522.84] So I was told that a post from 2015 was flagged for copyright infringement.
[8523.20 → 8523.52] Okay.
[8523.52 → 8527.40] So I clicked through, and I made my way over to our.
[8527.76 → 8528.74] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8528.74 → 8529.44] Right, right, right, right, right.
[8529.44 → 8529.70] Hold on.
[8529.76 → 8529.92] Okay.
[8529.92 → 8530.64] Let's get the story right.
[8530.64 → 8535.62] So I got an email from Facebook asking me about some feature, and I was trying to figure
[8535.62 → 8540.50] out how to turn off emails from Facebook about all their page management nonsense.
[8541.02 → 8542.34] There was no unsubscribe.
[8543.36 → 8548.12] There was no, because I don't want to block every email because occasionally, because it's
[8548.12 → 8552.98] for the page manager email, like occasionally they might send me something about my payment
[8552.98 → 8554.18] method being wrong or something.
[8554.22 → 8556.14] So I can't just block emails from Facebook.
[8556.92 → 8559.92] So I'm like, okay, there's no way to unsubscribe to this.
[8559.92 → 8567.52] There's no link to the interface where I can change my contact settings.
[8567.84 → 8573.40] So I clicked through to my Facebook page to try to figure out where the heck in the interface
[8573.40 → 8578.18] I was supposed to disable this stupid email notifying me of some stupid feature that I
[8578.18 → 8578.82] don't care about.
[8578.98 → 8587.94] The first thing that came up was that I had a copyright claim against a post from 10 years
[8587.94 → 8588.28] ago.
[8589.24 → 8589.68] Okay.
[8590.20 → 8591.72] So here we go.
[8592.24 → 8592.76] All right.
[8592.82 → 8593.70] So let's watch this.
[8593.78 → 8594.64] Here's what happened so far.
[8594.74 → 8596.80] No one else can see your post because it was reported for copyright.
[8597.28 → 8597.50] Okay.
[8597.52 → 8598.40] So here are my options.
[8598.92 → 8599.18] Oh yeah.
[8599.20 → 8599.92] I went back to the beginning.
[8600.54 → 8603.46] No one else can see your post because it was reported for copyright infringement.
[8605.42 → 8609.98] This is the post lifetime malware bites for $20 on Amazon US.
[8610.36 → 8611.34] Go, go, go.
[8611.52 → 8613.16] And it's a link to a tweet.
[8614.16 → 8614.52] Okay.
[8614.54 → 8616.92] I don't see how that could infringe on anyone's copyright.
[8617.14 → 8618.16] That actually sounds awesome.
[8618.16 → 8619.96] I kind of wish I did that.
[8619.96 → 8620.54] 10 years ago.
[8620.60 → 8620.94] Who cares?
[8621.48 → 8622.36] So I click it.
[8622.44 → 8623.08] I'm like, okay.
[8623.08 → 8626.42] So it's a link to an Amazon search for malware bites.
[8626.78 → 8627.14] Yeah.
[8627.30 → 8627.62] Okay.
[8627.62 → 8628.62] So I click continue.
[8628.62 → 8630.06] Who could possibly care about this?
[8631.06 → 8633.36] Malware bites corporate hold co.
[8633.36 → 8640.42] Or their authorized representative managed to find a post from 10 years ago.
[8640.42 → 8641.54] Well, they crawled it.
[8641.90 → 8642.32] Well, right.
[8642.40 → 8642.94] But why?
[8643.06 → 8643.64] Who cares?
[8643.86 → 8645.38] And also, what are you talking about?
[8645.44 → 8646.54] How does it infringe your copyright?
[8646.96 → 8647.12] Okay.
[8647.18 → 8649.36] So anyway, we don't allow content that whatever.
[8649.68 → 8650.92] So I can accept the decision.
[8651.08 → 8655.66] I can submit an appeal, or I can contact malware bites corporate hold co.
[8655.66 → 8659.40] I think I'm about to dox malware bites corporate hold co.
[8659.48 → 8661.66] So yeah, there's their email address and phone number anyway.
[8662.06 → 8662.66] Submit an appeal.
[8665.76 → 8667.06] Nothing happens.
[8667.46 → 8668.22] Go to form.
[8668.42 → 8669.24] Go to form.
[8669.62 → 8670.64] Go to form.
[8670.74 → 8670.98] Hello?
[8670.98 → 8674.02] It doesn't open another window.
[8674.94 → 8675.26] Nothing.
[8675.50 → 8676.98] It doesn't do anything else.
[8677.54 → 8678.50] Go to form.
[8678.72 → 8679.56] Strategic bugs.
[8679.76 → 8680.18] I like it.
[8680.94 → 8682.40] What the heck is this?
[8682.44 → 8684.22] What is going on right now?
[8685.04 → 8687.10] So here's the email from Facebook.
[8687.44 → 8689.32] How do I start a fan challenge?
[8689.62 → 8690.60] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[8690.76 → 8691.52] No unsubscribe.
[8691.52 → 8695.44] I'm fairly certain that this email is illegal in Canada.
[8696.62 → 8697.44] Like, what is it?
[8697.46 → 8697.76] What is it?
[8697.82 → 8698.58] Can spam again?
[8698.58 → 8698.64] Can spam?
[8699.54 → 8700.68] There is no.
[8700.68 → 8701.12] Yes, can spam.
[8701.38 → 8703.02] I have not opted into this.
[8703.62 → 8707.30] I went into my Facebook notification settings later.
[8707.72 → 8709.96] Actually, yeah, I think it was after I turned off the screen recording.
[8710.26 → 8713.58] I have everything that I can find turned off.
[8714.30 → 8722.26] And they sent me this bullshit from a stupid, like, malware bites claiming copyright infringement
[8722.26 → 8723.62] that I can't appeal.
[8723.76 → 8724.68] I don't even care.
[8724.80 → 8726.72] I don't need a 10-year-old post on Facebook.
[8726.72 → 8728.34] It's just how is this so broken?
[8729.02 → 8730.10] No, I'm not getting phished.
[8730.20 → 8732.06] It goes to actual Facebook.
[8733.04 → 8734.04] What the heck?
[8734.48 → 8735.10] That's all.
[8735.22 → 8736.48] That's all I have to say about that.
[8736.60 → 8741.54] I was just, I was in between rounds at my badminton ladder going through my email.
[8742.58 → 8744.96] I'm like, I was like, what is this?
[8745.00 → 8746.48] I don't know how to deal with this right now.
[8747.32 → 8748.26] That's very annoying.
[8748.26 → 8755.08] What I do know how to deal with is a big shout-out to the LTT Forum folding team.
[8755.22 → 8758.26] We had a record-breaking event, folding month eight.
[8758.58 → 8761.74] In total, the team produced over 230 billion points.
[8761.88 → 8763.86] That's nearly three times last year's total.
[8763.86 → 8766.34] We had 369 participants.
[8766.50 → 8766.66] Nice.
[8767.16 → 8774.62] And user Tobin demolished the previous record of six billion points and earned 112 billion points.
[8774.68 → 8775.84] I don't know exactly what that means.
[8776.22 → 8778.62] Oh, the previous record was six and it was 112.
[8778.72 → 8778.90] Wow.
[8778.90 → 8783.16] Special thanks to Living, Mr. Chute, yeah, Pancreas.
[8783.52 → 8783.70] Yeah.
[8783.96 → 8784.10] Yeah.
[8784.88 → 8790.80] Sultanate, Jaw Juice, Brick Cider, Dog Witch, and an anonymous forum member for donating a total of 55 prizes to the event.
[8791.26 → 8797.74] Additionally, 20 participants will be walking away with a $100 LTT store gift card.
[8800.20 → 8803.48] Justin Miller, a scientist from the Bowman Lab at the University of Pennsylvania,
[8803.48 → 8812.62] was very impressed by the total simulation time that the LTT or that Folding at Home contributed of 8.6 milliseconds during November.
[8813.10 → 8818.32] He said, that sounds like a small amount of time, but that is a ton for the types of motions that we like to study
[8818.32 → 8824.98] and roughly two to three orders of magnitude more than most simulation-focused papers tend to have on their own.
[8825.26 → 8825.38] Nice.
[8825.38 → 8827.20] So, massive thank you to everyone who participated.
[8827.20 → 8834.96] The final rankings and Justin's complete summary can be found in the final blog at, well, this link.
[8835.10 → 8836.68] Dan, do you want to throw the link in the various chats?
[8837.82 → 8838.68] Basically here.
[8839.56 → 8840.30] That's awesome.
[8840.72 → 8841.48] Yeah, super cool.
[8842.28 → 8843.30] Heck yeah, Folding Month.
[8844.70 → 8847.72] And I think we've got just one more topic before we get to After Dark.
[8848.10 → 8850.28] The world's first flying car!
[8850.64 → 8851.94] Here it is!
[8851.94 → 8852.94] Whoa!
[8855.10 → 8856.04] It's a flying car!
[8856.08 → 8859.70] The world's first flying car is now being handmade in California!
[8860.16 → 8861.90] And this right here!
[8862.94 → 8865.60] See all the dust and see all the air being blown up?
[8865.96 → 8871.58] Is exactly why I think I'm convinced that this is, pardon the pun, never going to take off.
[8872.86 → 8873.34] Yeah.
[8873.74 → 8876.16] I mean, that's been the argument, you know?
[8876.16 → 8887.86] Aleph Aeronautics, a U.S. startup, has started building its electric flying car, the Model A, by hand in California, becoming the first company to put a drive-and-fly car into production.
[8888.20 → 8898.62] The flying car can drive on regular roads and can take off vertically to fly with around a 220-mile driving and 110-mile flying range.
[8898.62 → 8910.50] Apparently, the startup has already received 3,500 pre-orders, which is a lot, considering that the flying car is expected to start at around $300,000.
[8911.78 → 8917.34] But there are a couple of small problems that are not included in our notes that are kind of hilarious.
[8917.92 → 8923.62] As cool as it would be to dunk on the Cybertruck by literally flying over it...
[8924.22 → 8926.74] It looks so sketchy. Have you watched this?
[8926.80 → 8927.28] Yes, I have.
[8927.28 → 8929.90] I just watched it. It looks so sketchy.
[8930.68 → 8932.78] And the wheels are so thin.
[8936.80 → 8938.56] It's like, oh, man.
[8940.08 → 8949.44] I feel like they just put, like, a fibreglass frame on a like, high-carrying-capacity drone.
[8949.64 → 8956.36] A detail that was overlooked is that at this time, it can only take off from and land at airports.
[8957.28 → 8960.86] So, like, what is the f***ING point of it?
[8960.86 → 8964.36] Oh, my God.
[8964.36 → 8964.38] Oh, my God.
[8964.88 → 8975.24] The whole idea behind flying car, like, the whole connotation of car is that you park it at your house and you, like, drive it to work.
[8975.38 → 8979.74] Or you go get groceries and you, like, park at your house again.
[8979.82 → 8984.22] Well, you could drive to the airport and then not, like, have to get out and get into a plane.
[8984.22 → 8987.50] You could drive to the airport and then just take off from the airport.
[8989.84 → 8991.00] That sounds pretty great.
[8992.22 → 8996.64] You can drive 220 miles with a 110-mile flight range.
[8996.78 → 8997.00] Wow.
[8997.08 → 8997.84] So, it's only half the...
[8998.48 → 8998.84] That's actually...
[8998.84 → 9000.10] That makes a lot of sense.
[9000.34 → 9000.60] Yeah.
[9001.36 → 9002.38] Less than a year later...
[9002.38 → 9006.18] I haven't seen it drive.
[9006.38 → 9007.32] Have you seen it drive?
[9007.52 → 9008.42] Is there a video of it driving?
[9009.50 → 9012.96] I've only seen it somewhat sketchily fly.
[9014.18 → 9015.76] I don't think I've seen it drive.
[9015.76 → 9029.70] As soon as I found out that it's slow, has crappy range, is expensive, has all the issues of any other personal flying vehicles, with the big one being, I forget what it's called, washout or something like that.
[9029.70 → 9048.32] Basically, the displacement of air that they need is so big, and the propellers that they can accommodate for any kind of VTOL functionality are so small that they have this, like, tiny cone that basically blows away anything anywhere near them.
[9048.32 → 9063.76] Like, there is, with the laws of physics being what they are, as far as I can tell, no reasonable path to driving one of these from your front driveway to your parking lot at work.
[9064.36 → 9072.08] They would blow so much crap around on the parking lot that you'd be denting and scratching everyone's car that you're anywhere near.
[9072.22 → 9073.02] People would hate it.
[9073.10 → 9073.92] They're so loud.
[9073.92 → 9090.64] Much larger propellers can help with the high-pitched noise and all of that, but you still have to deal with all that air displacement in order to lift this, like, hundreds of pounds vehicle plus whatever people and cargo that you want to carry in it.
[9090.68 → 9095.86] Like, it's just not going to happen, it seems.
[9095.86 → 9106.20] You can buy a really nice, really sweet car to drive to the airport and then get in your own just, like, experimental craft.
[9107.34 → 9108.18] That thing looks pretty sick.
[9108.38 → 9112.18] What's the side impact crash rating on this flying car?
[9112.54 → 9114.44] For sure, just nothing.
[9115.50 → 9117.00] The crumples is you.
[9118.42 → 9119.58] Like, come on.
[9119.70 → 9122.06] You are expected to crumple alone with the car.
[9122.18 → 9122.40] Yeah.
[9122.68 → 9124.18] Your bones will absorb the impact.
[9124.18 → 9125.50] It's just going to hit the batteries.
[9125.80 → 9126.40] Yeah, sure.
[9127.42 → 9129.32] Like, come on.
[9130.42 → 9131.96] Oh, very fun.
[9132.14 → 9132.74] Very cool.
[9132.84 → 9133.48] Very good.
[9133.60 → 9133.96] Looks cool.
[9134.18 → 9139.04] They go out of their way, it seems, to make it really hard to see how skinny chicken these tires are.
[9139.04 → 9141.46] Dude, they're so narrow.
[9143.68 → 9144.64] Oh, man.
[9145.42 → 9146.90] Yeah, you can see them there.
[9147.14 → 9147.40] Yeah.
[9147.84 → 9149.82] They look like wheelbarrow tires.
[9150.02 → 9151.00] Yeah, yeah.
[9152.00 → 9153.22] Oh, my gosh.
[9154.18 → 9154.54] Yeah.
[9154.84 → 9156.00] So, this is...
[9156.00 → 9156.50] Damn, dude.
[9156.78 → 9157.54] Yeah, this is...
[9157.54 → 9158.42] You said they got pre-orders?
[9159.24 → 9159.64] Apparently.
[9159.84 → 9160.90] That's the craziest part to me.
[9160.90 → 9161.72] That's what it says in the notes.
[9161.82 → 9162.04] I mean...
[9162.04 → 9162.96] Them working on this is cool.
[9163.06 → 9164.00] I actually have no issue with that at all.
[9164.00 → 9169.20] Okay, so we just had a huge, long conversation with the audience about ignorance.
[9170.46 → 9170.78] Remember?
[9170.78 → 9173.56] Not everybody is an engineer.
[9175.44 → 9179.18] And a lot of people would think, oh, well, you know, they got...
[9179.18 → 9181.12] I forget what body they got approval from.
[9181.24 → 9186.72] But they, like, are making progress to this being a product that they actually ship.
[9186.72 → 9188.12] Um...
[9188.12 → 9193.00] And so, if I heard that they got their, yeah, airworthiness certification from the FAA.
[9193.48 → 9195.30] They got an airworthiness certification.
[9195.58 → 9196.18] That's huge.
[9196.26 → 9197.04] That's huge.
[9197.56 → 9197.94] Right?
[9198.44 → 9199.98] So, I'd be like, oh, yeah, flying car.
[9200.66 → 9201.72] I see this picture.
[9202.36 → 9203.60] I go, I mean, what?
[9203.68 → 9204.58] Yeah, 300 grand?
[9204.70 → 9205.34] I mean, that's...
[9205.34 → 9206.26] That's only...
[9206.26 → 9208.76] That's only 10 times the price of a car that doesn't fly.
[9209.46 → 9209.86] Right?
[9210.00 → 9210.50] Like...
[9210.50 → 9213.84] They got so many more degrees of freedom.
[9214.12 → 9214.82] That's so good.
[9215.60 → 9219.94] Honestly, if they just never released this video, I feel like they'd do better.
[9220.40 → 9222.06] Well, they've been doing pretty good up till now.
[9222.12 → 9222.90] They got their pre-orders.
[9223.34 → 9225.58] And, yeah, not everybody's an engineer.
[9226.40 → 9230.62] So, yeah, I could see people pre-ordering it if they just don't do the math.
[9230.62 → 9231.62] Like, it wasn't until...
[9232.28 → 9235.54] For me, too, that I came across, like, a perfect article.
[9235.64 → 9237.56] I wish I could find it so that I could bring it up.
[9237.62 → 9240.32] I read it, and then I, like, kind of lost it, and then I never saw it again.
[9240.78 → 9244.06] But it was a perfect article that basically kind of walked me through the math
[9244.06 → 9247.30] of how this is just, like, kind of f***ING impossible.
[9247.98 → 9248.68] And they're like...
[9248.68 → 9254.52] At the end of it, they're like, look, don't short it because, you know, you can't stay...
[9254.52 → 9257.46] They'll stay irrational longer than you'll stay solvent or whatever.
[9257.60 → 9260.28] Like, I'm not saying you should, like, short these companies
[9260.28 → 9262.50] and try and make a bunch of money on their downfall or whatever.
[9262.58 → 9264.96] I'm just saying don't invest in them.
[9265.10 → 9268.62] Don't pre-order this stuff because this ain't happening.
[9269.40 → 9270.26] This is not happening.
[9270.50 → 9271.58] I'm like, oh, okay.
[9271.74 → 9272.00] Bummer.
[9272.18 → 9273.10] Because that would be awesome.
[9273.26 → 9274.38] Like, I'd be so down.
[9274.50 → 9278.58] I hope that, you know, they got their flight worthiness thing or whatever.
[9278.72 → 9281.80] I hope that it ends up being awesome because, like, why not?
[9282.46 → 9282.54] Yeah.
[9282.54 → 9283.00] I just...
[9283.00 → 9284.28] That video...
[9284.28 → 9284.96] Wasn't awesome.
[9284.98 → 9286.28] ...does not make it look good.
[9287.44 → 9289.58] But, hey, I mean, all power to them.
[9289.64 → 9289.98] Good luck.
[9291.76 → 9292.50] Oh, whoa.
[9293.74 → 9294.04] Cool.
[9294.04 → 9296.10] Hilarious.
[9296.76 → 9297.22] Not fun.
[9299.22 → 9299.86] Is that it?
[9299.92 → 9300.26] After Dark?
[9300.34 → 9301.34] I think it's time for After Dark.
[9301.50 → 9301.82] Nice.
[9301.86 → 9303.18] Mr. Daniel Lesser, hit us.
[9303.90 → 9304.24] Sure.
[9305.04 → 9307.62] Let me just get the banner and the button.
[9307.78 → 9308.06] Oh, yeah.
[9308.20 → 9309.70] Not financial advice.
[9309.78 → 9310.60] Just throwing that out there.
[9311.42 → 9312.50] I always got to throw that out there.
[9313.46 → 9315.54] Okay, let's see what we've got today.
[9316.04 → 9316.74] Hey, dudes.
[9316.94 → 9321.62] Aside from YouTube, which single company's sudden shutdown would have the most immediate detrimental
[9321.62 → 9322.88] impact on LMG?
[9323.16 → 9324.62] Which would be the most beneficial?
[9325.22 → 9326.86] A beneficial shutdown.
[9328.00 → 9329.58] I don't know if there's anyone...
[9329.58 → 9331.72] We're all about partnerships.
[9332.22 → 9336.36] I don't think there's anyone that I would look at and go, yeah, them shutting down would
[9336.36 → 9338.12] be highly beneficial to us.
[9338.92 → 9339.82] Who'd be beneficial?
[9339.82 → 9342.82] I usually see the like...
[9342.82 → 9346.18] The competitor, maybe, but I don't really see us as having competitors in a traditional
[9346.18 → 9346.52] sense.
[9346.62 → 9350.82] I usually see, especially the space we're in, not all spaces, but the space we're in
[9350.82 → 9352.40] as Rising Tide lifts all ships.
[9352.44 → 9352.90] Yeah, me too.
[9353.04 → 9357.32] I think the more people that are interested in tech will help all of us.
[9357.52 → 9361.84] And if other people in the tech space are making good content, I think that will help
[9361.84 → 9362.88] us, not hurt us.
[9363.06 → 9363.24] Yeah.
[9363.24 → 9364.18] I've always seen it that way.
[9364.20 → 9365.38] I mean, this is fascinating.
[9365.38 → 9372.92] So the timing of the release of that interview that I did with John, I was talking in the
[9372.92 → 9378.68] interview about how our viewership has kind of struggled lately, right?
[9379.52 → 9382.82] But I did that interview a couple of months ago.
[9383.62 → 9388.76] And so that obviously there's a ton of comments on the interview with people giving me their
[9388.76 → 9395.14] brilliant ideas for what I can do to fix my channel or how talking about how, you know,
[9395.44 → 9400.74] yeah, it's all because, you know, Alex and Andy are gone or whatever the case may be,
[9400.78 → 9400.96] right?
[9402.08 → 9409.48] But what people don't bother to do is check and see if there's any truth whatsoever to
[9409.48 → 9410.24] their hypothesis.
[9410.24 → 9417.30] And to be clear, I'm not saying that, you know, I wouldn't, that I don't love working
[9417.30 → 9422.04] with Alex and Andy or whatever, but we've actually had a nice little resurgence lately.
[9422.42 → 9428.16] And we are back to the kinds of numbers that we were doing, you know, earlier this year
[9428.16 → 9430.84] slash, you know, before the recent dip.
[9430.94 → 9433.52] Like, in fact, we're quite a bit higher than that now.
[9433.52 → 9439.68] We're tracking to do probably more like 80 million views for December, it looks like.
[9439.68 → 9445.04] Like, so that's back up at a level that's sort of closer to sort of November of last
[9445.04 → 9445.22] year.
[9445.30 → 9447.98] Like there tends to be kind of, there's a seasonality to it to a degree.
[9448.66 → 9448.82] Right.
[9448.92 → 9455.56] So we are, we are higher than probably in the, in the next month, we'll be higher than probably
[9455.56 → 9462.26] about eyeballing this 70 to 70% of the months of the past, like 18.
[9462.26 → 9470.68] Um, so thank you for your, you know, advice and your analysis of, you know, why LMG is
[9470.68 → 9473.58] failing or whatever the case may be, but we're not failing.
[9473.58 → 9480.96] And a big part of why we don't fail is we are constantly looking inward, looking outward,
[9481.20 → 9484.06] figuring out, you know, what it is that we need to do differently.
[9484.20 → 9485.40] How can we generate excitement?
[9485.40 → 9487.04] How can we elevate our content?
[9487.18 → 9488.40] How can we optimize our processes?
[9488.96 → 9494.88] And the answers are always going to be different in an ever-changing world that is competitive.
[9495.12 → 9500.72] Even if I don't see other YouTubers or other media outlets as competitors.
[9501.34 → 9502.52] Does that make sense?
[9502.88 → 9503.02] Yeah.
[9503.12 → 9509.98] And we've had great people leave, and we will have great people leave, and we'll have great
[9509.98 → 9510.70] people join.
[9510.70 → 9511.18] Yes.
[9511.42 → 9516.44] And then we are a business in constant flux, just like every single other business.
[9516.92 → 9520.94] And we will have different eras because there will be different people here at different
[9520.94 → 9521.42] times.
[9521.78 → 9524.96] And like Taylor Swift, I may do a tour about my eras.
[9525.06 → 9525.96] You might, you might.
[9526.16 → 9526.30] Probably not.
[9526.52 → 9529.46] And this is all extremely normal.
[9530.32 → 9531.20] Um, yep.
[9531.36 → 9532.28] And that's okay.
[9534.02 → 9539.66] Everything is a normal thing that is happening right now.
[9539.66 → 9546.20] And, and you know, what's another normal thing for there to be times of unusual strife.
[9546.84 → 9547.32] Yeah.
[9547.88 → 9549.08] That's also normal.
[9549.26 → 9551.62] Even if it is abnormal.
[9551.86 → 9554.44] And so there will be times of abnormality.
[9554.80 → 9557.74] There will be future times when, you know what?
[9557.78 → 9559.12] We might hire a lot.
[9559.32 → 9561.96] There will be future times when we might have a lot of turnover.
[9562.22 → 9565.76] There will be future times when our content is not performing well.
[9565.76 → 9569.20] And there will be future times when our content is performing really well.
[9569.86 → 9575.44] And, and all of that is just part of the natural ebbs and flows of, of running a business
[9575.44 → 9578.18] in a, in a fast, fast, fast changing world.
[9578.62 → 9582.02] Maybe Steam will release or Valve will release a bunch of hardware all at once.
[9582.26 → 9582.50] Yeah.
[9582.52 → 9583.50] That was, that was nice.
[9583.62 → 9586.18] That was, what a Christmas present that was for us.
[9586.22 → 9586.52] Yeah.
[9586.52 → 9590.58] You know, it was, it was encouraging, right?
[9590.66 → 9595.22] You know, because it's not like I, it's not like I'm immune to, you know, feeling a lack
[9595.22 → 9596.22] of confidence sometimes.
[9596.22 → 9596.66] Right?
[9596.74 → 9598.90] Like, you know, I see the content not performing.
[9599.00 → 9601.00] I go like, do I even, do I even got this anymore?
[9601.00 → 9603.42] You know, like I'm always asking myself that.
[9603.42 → 9610.62] And then someone does me the, the like bare minimum is favour of releasing some hardware
[9610.62 → 9611.60] that's interesting.
[9612.30 → 9614.08] And we get like, what?
[9614.20 → 9617.54] 4 million views on one of them and like four and a half on the other, three and a half
[9617.54 → 9618.42] and four and a half.
[9618.42 → 9619.70] 3.8 and 4.8 right now.
[9619.72 → 9619.74] Yeah.
[9619.74 → 9620.36] Something like that.
[9620.64 → 9621.78] And I'm just like, oh, okay.
[9621.80 → 9622.02] No, no.
[9622.04 → 9622.48] I still do.
[9622.60 → 9623.76] I still do know how to do this.
[9623.78 → 9626.10] I did those videos in like two hours each.
[9626.56 → 9629.98] Just the Steam Machine won't cost what you think got 2.6.
[9630.12 → 9630.36] Yeah.
[9630.36 → 9632.54] Like, it was a good video.
[9632.82 → 9634.18] Just cool, interesting stuff.
[9634.28 → 9634.56] Yeah.
[9635.18 → 9635.42] Yeah.
[9635.54 → 9639.18] No, I think not just I, I think we've still got it.
[9639.34 → 9644.40] I do think that we have, I mean, you guys were even talking about this before the video,
[9644.76 → 9646.04] before we started WAN Show.
[9646.14 → 9648.44] Just like looking at some of the process bloat and stuff.
[9648.52 → 9650.28] We have, yeah.
[9650.58 → 9651.26] We have problems.
[9651.70 → 9658.20] There's going to be, there's going to need to be some work done on kind of addressing
[9658.20 → 9660.58] how things flow through the company.
[9660.86 → 9661.44] I think so.
[9661.44 → 9661.90] And stuff.
[9662.10 → 9662.68] I think so.
[9662.68 → 9667.94] And it's just, you know, we've existed for so many years at this point, and we've, we've
[9667.94 → 9669.72] kind of always just built.
[9671.00 → 9677.20] There hasn't really been a lot of removing things, cutting back on certain things, trying
[9677.20 → 9681.42] to see, hey, if we cut out a bunch of processes here, what happens?
[9681.42 → 9681.92] What would happen?
[9682.16 → 9682.44] Yeah.
[9682.90 → 9683.36] Yeah.
[9683.36 → 9689.72] Because sometimes like there's, there's process that was originally designed to help solve
[9689.72 → 9699.34] problems, which due to misuse or rot or improper initial creation, actually just creates more
[9699.34 → 9705.32] problems, creates more cycles for people to have to do, especially cycles that suck and
[9705.32 → 9706.68] they don't want to do ever.
[9706.84 → 9708.74] That is like absolutely a thing that happens.
[9708.88 → 9712.24] So yeah, we have, we have things to address, but we're working on it.
[9712.32 → 9717.16] And that's normal, especially as far as my understanding goes, when companies get to around
[9717.16 → 9722.80] this size, like this ends up being a major problem when companies get around the hundred
[9722.80 → 9726.12] plus is size, which is exactly where we're at.
[9726.24 → 9726.96] Everything changes.
[9727.26 → 9727.50] Yeah.
[9727.94 → 9729.12] So this all makes sense.
[9729.18 → 9730.68] And there will continue to be changed.
[9732.86 → 9735.42] Someone asked, here we go.
[9735.56 → 9738.30] Capture the bomb asks, speaking of ebbs and flows, how's the badminton club doing?
[9739.46 → 9739.88] I don't know.
[9739.90 → 9741.12] You tell me here's a live feed.
[9743.34 → 9743.74] Okay.
[9743.92 → 9745.18] That looks pretty good to me.
[9745.18 → 9749.86] Got some, got some people playing some badminton all up in this booth.
[9749.86 → 9752.32] How embarrassing would it be to just biff right now?
[9752.96 → 9753.66] No, they'll be fine.
[9754.38 → 9755.36] They're solid, solid players.
[9755.50 → 9756.14] Actually, it's a good club.
[9758.68 → 9764.94] Yeah, no, it's, this is, this is one of those where like, it was a passion project that
[9764.94 → 9769.36] like, you know, was never really like intended to make money.
[9769.36 → 9773.82] And it's still, it's, it's still a little more complicated than like, yeah.
[9775.24 → 9776.68] You know, yo, I'm making money.
[9776.78 → 9778.50] See, so to world, I hope you're ready for me.
[9778.58 → 9779.30] Now gather round.
[9779.58 → 9779.94] Yeah.
[9779.96 → 9781.76] You know, like it's not quite that.
[9781.84 → 9782.02] Right.
[9782.06 → 9782.52] But it's.
[9782.64 → 9783.92] I wish it was a little bit taller.
[9784.34 → 9784.52] Yeah.
[9784.56 → 9784.74] Yeah.
[9784.80 → 9786.12] Well, that, that, yes.
[9786.24 → 9786.46] But.
[9786.46 → 9789.72] Oh, I honestly wasn't even Memling that.
[9789.82 → 9790.12] I just.
[9791.44 → 9792.14] No, no, no.
[9792.30 → 9794.92] Well, that's the different artists, different song.
[9795.10 → 9796.92] I was, I was Humpy Dance.
[9797.14 → 9797.74] Like totally different.
[9797.74 → 9798.66] And I know you used to like that song.
[9798.76 → 9799.14] It's fine.
[9799.42 → 9799.72] Okay.
[9799.72 → 9807.62] The point is that, yeah, we kind of accidentally, we kind of accidentally a good sports facility
[9807.62 → 9809.28] that's actually doing really well.
[9809.74 → 9810.98] Like there's, probably.
[9811.64 → 9814.02] You were just accidentally a successful business.
[9814.02 → 9817.02] Yeah, there's probably a solid like 60 people in there right now.
[9817.12 → 9818.16] There's people in the concession.
[9819.22 → 9821.06] There's some people hanging out in the lounge.
[9821.30 → 9822.48] There's people in the retail shop.
[9822.92 → 9823.98] Is the concession like a thing yet?
[9824.22 → 9824.44] Uh-uh.
[9824.80 → 9825.36] Uh-uh.
[9825.44 → 9825.62] Mm.
[9826.48 → 9830.74] But we do have those cool like Japanese style like hot food vending machines.
[9830.74 → 9830.84] Oh, those are there.
[9831.14 → 9831.28] Yeah.
[9831.28 → 9831.58] Okay.
[9831.84 → 9832.12] Cool.
[9832.60 → 9834.48] I mean, that's nice.
[9834.80 → 9835.00] Yeah.
[9835.04 → 9837.84] So Smash Champs will use them except when there's Whale Land.
[9838.70 → 9839.36] Yeah, sure.
[9839.74 → 9839.92] Yeah.
[9839.92 → 9844.08] Is there any progress on having an actual concession?
[9845.20 → 9845.48] No.
[9846.18 → 9846.48] Okay.
[9846.66 → 9846.86] Yeah.
[9846.96 → 9852.44] The managers feel extremely strongly that we need to have a steam room and a sauna.
[9853.06 → 9857.14] I'm really not sure that I agree that's that important, but we also want to put in some
[9857.14 → 9857.72] more showers.
[9857.90 → 9859.22] We only have a couple right now.
[9859.42 → 9860.04] Showers I could see.
[9860.16 → 9861.32] We should add more.
[9861.32 → 9867.34] Um, I think that a steam room and sauna is a very optional thing for a badminton club,
[9867.34 → 9867.72] but.
[9868.24 → 9868.54] Yeah.
[9868.78 → 9872.96] I basically told them, look, you're allowed to put it in as long as it doesn't cost any
[9872.96 → 9874.06] of our floor area.
[9874.36 → 9878.78] If you don't use up floor plate, then like if you can put them above the showers at the
[9878.78 → 9880.40] back or something like that, I'm open to it.
[9880.40 → 9884.16] But they pitched me like splitting up the gym and putting that at the back and putting
[9884.16 → 9888.04] the like sauna, steam room, shower stuff like upstairs.
[9888.16 → 9890.52] I was like, no, no, we are not doing that.
[9890.56 → 9894.62] A gym is a way more relevant thing to a badminton club than that.
[9894.94 → 9897.04] I can see people wanting to do sauna.
[9897.24 → 9899.22] Doing sauna after physical activity is pretty sick.
[9899.30 → 9899.56] Sure.
[9899.56 → 9908.74] Um, but yeah, if you just try to make it additive if possible, um, also the concession will help
[9908.74 → 9910.44] money for sure.
[9910.64 → 9911.24] Uh, yes.
[9911.36 → 9913.34] No, actually people are constantly exercising.
[9913.84 → 9916.28] I heard that other clubs that have tried to do them.
[9916.40 → 9918.90] It's been break even at best.
[9919.28 → 9920.70] So we may be better off.
[9920.76 → 9925.42] I think we get a pretty narrow margin on those vending machines, but we may actually be better
[9925.42 → 9926.42] off with the vending machines.
[9926.42 → 9927.44] So interesting.
[9927.54 → 9928.34] TBD on the website.
[9928.52 → 9928.88] Bump that.
[9928.88 → 9929.56] Interesting.
[9930.26 → 9935.86] I do know, uh, as far as my understanding goes, you usually have to make the concession
[9935.86 → 9937.62] like actually pretty good.
[9938.00 → 9941.50] And then it ends up also getting things like Uber Eats orders.
[9941.62 → 9942.00] Interesting.
[9942.00 → 9948.10] Because there's, it's actually very rare that you can get like actually pretty well, like
[9948.10 → 9950.30] balanced meals on Uber Eats.
[9950.84 → 9952.32] So like, uh, I could see that.
[9952.54 → 9957.90] Gold's Gym in Langley has like a, uh, um, protein shake.
[9957.90 → 9958.76] Yeah.
[9958.76 → 9958.80] Yeah.
[9958.80 → 9962.14] And also some like wraps and stuff, but they're like more protein heavy.
[9962.28 → 9962.80] Oh, that's cool.
[9962.92 → 9965.50] They don't have high sugar counts and all that other kind of stuff.
[9965.90 → 9968.32] Um, so like if you did like, oh, it's a badminton gym.
[9968.32 → 9971.68] So there are things that like, you know, we could do a smash burger.
[9971.68 → 9979.40] I think that's pretty far from the point I was trying to make.
[9979.62 → 9980.70] But it's great for the branding.
[9980.96 → 9982.56] But it is great for the branding.
[9983.02 → 9984.02] It is absolutely.
[9984.42 → 9986.74] Like something, I mean, I would personally appreciate.
[9986.74 → 9990.62] I don't know if this is the right fit for smash chance.
[9990.72 → 9996.62] Probably not necessarily, but I think it maybe should be is if you had like, uh, a protein
[9996.62 → 10001.00] shake kind of thing, and it had like five grams creatine.
[10001.58 → 10002.80] I think that would be sick.
[10003.08 → 10003.94] It's hard to get.
[10004.04 → 10007.16] Boosted Juice does it, but there aren't that many other places that do.
[10007.54 → 10007.58] Interesting.
[10008.04 → 10011.74] Um, so like, I think there are ways to make it make sense, but I think you have to kind
[10011.74 → 10017.36] of open up the interest in that where it's not necessarily just the, the badminton club
[10017.36 → 10018.30] that would be interested in it.
[10018.64 → 10019.62] Yeah, I'd be down for that.
[10020.32 → 10024.90] There'd be, the thing is like, you have to find someone to kind of spearhead that, right?
[10025.22 → 10029.74] And right now we're just, we're busy figuring out how to run a sports facility.
[10029.74 → 10031.28] We haven't even been open to the pub.
[10031.38 → 10035.42] We haven't even been, we've been open a year, but we haven't been taking money for a year.
[10035.42 → 10039.46] So we've been like soft open, but our grand opening was less than a year ago.
[10039.46 → 10042.74] So we still, we still have a lot of little things to figure out.
[10043.50 → 10048.78] Um, yeah, I realized, sorry, the numbers I was showing before, it didn't look like we
[10048.78 → 10052.78] were tracking up that much, but last 30 days, uh, 85 million.
[10053.08 → 10053.52] Yeah.
[10053.52 → 10061.48] So that's actually like quite, quite up there with our top months over the last 18, 75.
[10061.96 → 10064.62] It's like almost on par with like August 2024.
[10064.62 → 10068.04] So we're, we're tracking back up, and we'll track back down.
[10068.26 → 10068.66] Yep.
[10068.84 → 10069.54] And that's okay.
[10070.36 → 10070.68] It's okay.
[10070.72 → 10071.44] We'll survive.
[10071.66 → 10072.80] We will survive.
[10073.60 → 10077.20] Oh, as long as I know how to tech, I know we'll stay alive.
[10077.56 → 10078.26] Uh, Dan, hit me.
[10079.26 → 10081.14] Hello, my par asocial friends.
[10081.28 → 10081.82] Oh, hi there.
[10082.24 → 10087.00] I'm not a float plane subscriber because I already have two similar subscriptions and my brain
[10087.00 → 10088.60] refuses to let me have another.
[10089.00 → 10091.92] Do any of you have arbitrary rules like this?
[10092.08 → 10092.46] Oh, tons.
[10092.46 → 10093.52] I don't think that's arbitrary.
[10094.04 → 10098.06] I think limiting the number of subscriptions you have is totally fair.
[10098.20 → 10099.54] Totally not arbitrary.
[10099.82 → 10107.26] I mean, the two, I guess, is an arbitrary number, but I, I, I think two is a pretty good
[10107.26 → 10107.66] number.
[10108.98 → 10109.38] Yeah.
[10109.42 → 10110.60] It seems pretty reasonable to me.
[10110.68 → 10110.80] Yeah.
[10110.80 → 10111.46] It seems pretty reasonable.
[10111.64 → 10112.28] I really don't.
[10112.36 → 10113.36] I probably have.
[10113.36 → 10116.22] Huh.
[10118.30 → 10119.50] I think I have one.
[10120.96 → 10121.94] I'm not even trying to flex.
[10121.94 → 10122.22] You have Netflix?
[10122.70 → 10122.98] Nope.
[10123.36 → 10123.80] No Netflix.
[10123.92 → 10124.32] Oh, that's right.
[10124.34 → 10125.24] You ditched it a while back.
[10125.42 → 10126.02] Long time ago.
[10126.74 → 10127.78] What do you have then?
[10128.04 → 10128.36] YouTube.
[10128.80 → 10129.14] Oh, yeah.
[10129.14 → 10129.76] Just YouTube premium.
[10129.92 → 10130.10] Yep.
[10130.20 → 10130.42] Okay.
[10130.42 → 10130.58] Yeah.
[10130.58 → 10140.16] My company got hacked last month through a zero-day exploit in Centerstack.
[10140.26 → 10140.56] Bummer.
[10140.84 → 10144.76] It looks like we paid the ransom for the encryption key.
[10145.58 → 10147.50] Have you guys known anyone who has paid?
[10147.68 → 10148.68] What is the process?
[10148.78 → 10149.48] I haven't.
[10150.52 → 10152.00] I actually don't.
[10153.74 → 10154.26] Uh.
[10155.84 → 10156.42] Yeah, right.
[10156.72 → 10157.20] Yeah.
[10157.32 → 10157.76] Good call.
[10158.40 → 10158.50] Good.
[10158.60 → 10159.06] Who's there?
[10159.06 → 10161.46] Scammers.
[10162.84 → 10163.88] F*** you, man.
[10164.24 → 10165.14] Get out of here.
[10165.56 → 10165.94] No.
[10167.10 → 10168.26] I've been here for months.
[10169.70 → 10170.10] Yeah.
[10170.22 → 10170.54] Sorry.
[10170.62 → 10172.28] I don't know anything about the process.
[10174.20 → 10174.60] Bummer.
[10174.72 → 10175.42] Sorry to hear that.
[10179.86 → 10180.30] Okay.
[10181.38 → 10182.52] Hi, LLD.
[10183.04 → 10186.66] Linus, do you still daily drive a 7900 XTX?
[10186.66 → 10192.84] What's your take on where RDNA 3 is headed after being missing in Wednesday's Redstone announcement?
[10193.08 → 10194.48] I mean, this is kind of classic AMD.
[10194.64 → 10197.62] I think for the most part, they do their best to support their older products.
[10197.62 → 10208.08] But, like, they are a much smaller company than NVIDIA still, even after all the success that they've had on the CPU and the APU side.
[10208.72 → 10210.48] I'm not surprised by it.
[10210.58 → 10218.20] The 7900 XT just does not have the neural processing to do what they would want it to do with FSR Redstone.
[10218.20 → 10223.16] As far as I can tell, I'd love to be wrong, but it just doesn't really seem like it.
[10224.30 → 10233.38] And, yes, I'm still daily driving it in my PC upstairs, but I've actually been doing more than half of my gaming on my PC downstairs,
[10233.58 → 10238.16] because that's, like, where my kids are usually sitting, and Yvonne doesn't game.
[10238.16 → 10244.94] So I would either be sitting by myself upstairs, or if I was streaming, I would be upstairs, but I haven't streamed in, like, forever.
[10245.20 → 10253.08] So, yes, it's still in my main machine, but I haven't been gaming on it as my, like, primary card for a little while.
[10254.44 → 10255.38] Hi, LLD.
[10255.38 → 10258.40] Lee, my partner and I are combining our skills to go into business together.
[10258.84 → 10264.28] My question for Linus is, was there anything you should have discussed with Yvonne before working together?
[10265.50 → 10266.22] Oh, yeah.
[10266.64 → 10276.76] I think something that we, even to this day, are not perfectly aligned on is, where's the endpoint?
[10277.86 → 10280.92] What is the target we're trying to hit?
[10280.92 → 10288.74] And I think that having that agreement, especially if you're going into business with, it sounds like, a romantic partner,
[10289.46 → 10296.82] having that agreement in place is going to be critical to maintaining harmony in your relationship.
[10297.00 → 10308.22] Because if one of you has the goal of, you know, achieving a better work-life balance by running your own business and being able to set your own hours,
[10308.22 → 10317.20] and one of you has the goal of conquering the world and taking, you know, the business sphere by storm,
[10317.60 → 10326.26] then it's going to be hard to agree when you've achieved success because you both have completely different goals.
[10327.22 → 10331.64] And talk about that.
[10331.64 → 10332.64] Yeah.
[10335.86 → 10338.34] Mary, Linus, Luke, and Dan.
[10338.48 → 10339.34] Hey, Mary...
[10339.34 → 10339.78] Mary...
[10339.78 → 10340.18] Mary...
[10340.18 → 10341.02] Mary...
[10341.02 → 10341.04] Mary...
[10341.04 → 10341.06] Mary...
[10341.06 → 10341.62] Mary...
[10341.62 → 10342.14] Pippin.
[10343.30 → 10343.76] Yeah.
[10344.62 → 10345.54] I like that.
[10345.78 → 10346.82] What about Second Mary?
[10346.84 → 10347.84] Lord of the Rings is based.
[10348.46 → 10349.64] I'm looking to...
[10349.64 → 10351.88] Wow, hot take there, Luke.
[10354.26 → 10355.22] You know, I...
[10355.22 → 10356.40] I'm bringing those spicy ones.
[10356.60 → 10359.54] You're really going to piss off a lot of the community with that one.
[10359.54 → 10363.54] No offence, but I thought the Lord of the Rings was pretty okay.
[10366.80 → 10371.28] I'm looking to introduce my mother to a new video game this holiday season.
[10371.76 → 10375.62] Any recommendations with good story that would be easy to learn for the elderly?
[10377.62 → 10379.54] For the elderly...
[10381.00 → 10382.08] Good story.
[10382.84 → 10386.36] I feel like games are getting harder, not easier.
[10386.36 → 10388.32] Star dew Valley Animal Crossing.
[10388.58 → 10390.94] And I'm not typecasting because it's grandma.
[10391.44 → 10392.36] Those are just...
[10393.08 → 10400.48] Like, Animal Crossing in particular, I know, was widely accepted by a non-gaming audience.
[10401.52 → 10407.90] I think Star dew Valley is also a potentially lower lift in regard to non-gaming audience.
[10407.90 → 10412.70] Outside of that, I think very, like, narrative-heavy games.
[10412.96 → 10415.52] If you try to think of the types of games where, like...
[10415.52 → 10415.78] Yeah.
[10416.14 → 10421.56] People would enjoy chilling on the couch while you play because it's, like, fun to watch.
[10421.64 → 10424.94] And then you pair that with they're not mechanically overly difficult.
[10426.30 → 10428.58] I suspect that would work pretty well.
[10429.38 → 10430.72] Promotes as Guitar Hero.
[10430.90 → 10431.82] Yeah, how about not?
[10431.82 → 10435.82] Bob said Elder Scrolls Dagger fall, which is...
[10437.36 → 10438.68] Get out.
[10438.98 → 10441.08] Yeah, not going to go super well.
[10442.54 → 10443.62] Pankaj's a good suggestion.
[10444.06 → 10444.70] Telltale Games.
[10445.44 → 10448.22] Just a bunch of different Telltale Games are all probably decent.
[10448.34 → 10453.46] If there's something in the Telltale Games universe that fits their fancy, then that might be a good way to go.
[10454.56 → 10455.90] I mean, there's so much.
[10456.02 → 10457.14] You can turn the enemies off.
[10457.14 → 10462.78] Can you actually just turn them off?
[10462.98 → 10463.56] Yeah, yeah.
[10464.08 → 10465.62] That would be fun.
[10466.12 → 10468.46] The last one I have for you today is...
[10468.46 → 10469.04] Hi, LLD.
[10469.46 → 10474.10] Is there any early stage or emerging tech you're particularly excited about?
[10474.10 → 10477.68] I mean, the emerging tech is, like, all robotics and AI, right?
[10477.80 → 10479.42] Like, that's kind of the big one.
[10479.54 → 10479.84] AR glasses.
[10481.58 → 10483.24] Yeah, AR glasses are pretty cool.
[10483.56 → 10486.94] Oh, I don't know if the thing I tried today was embargoed, but it was cool.
[10486.94 → 10488.94] Neat.
[10490.82 → 10495.94] I am scared about the current direction of AR glasses, but I'm hoping that...
[10495.94 → 10496.58] More AI?
[10496.96 → 10497.92] Well, yeah.
[10498.28 → 10500.44] And the people who are winning right now.
[10500.94 → 10502.50] But I'm hoping that...
[10502.50 → 10503.16] Winning hard.
[10504.08 → 10506.94] Yeah, it's, like, actually kind of weird.
[10507.38 → 10508.06] What the heck?
[10508.14 → 10509.78] We didn't do the second set of sponsors.
[10510.36 → 10511.30] Hold that thought.
[10511.40 → 10511.80] Beans.
[10511.88 → 10513.92] The show is brought to you today by Proton.
[10513.92 → 10519.00] It's becoming somewhat more common for messaging apps to use end-to-end encryption.
[10519.42 → 10521.06] Why isn't that the standard with your email?
[10521.62 → 10526.10] Well, the folks over at Proton designed ProtonMail with your privacy in mind.

[10559.60 → 10564.22] Go to Proton.me slash when and start protecting your information today.
[10564.76 → 10567.26] The show is also brought to you by Odd Pieces.
[10567.64 → 10572.88] How many times has someone been given a gift on Christmas just to go hide in their room and play with their new gizmos and gadgets?
[10573.58 → 10574.80] That's not family time!
[10574.96 → 10579.10] Isn't the point of the holiday season to come together and connect like a puzzle?
[10580.36 → 10581.76] Get it? Connect like a puzzle?
[10581.76 → 10582.32] That's pretty good.
[10582.44 → 10584.14] Connect like a camera connected to your game.
[10584.26 → 10584.94] No, it doesn't matter.
[10585.02 → 10591.50] The point is, Odd Pieces is a puzzle that, as it's assembled, will tell you a story.
[10591.60 → 10602.44] So you'll have an image that takes place before, and then the puzzle itself is going to be what happens after, a few seconds later.
[10602.44 → 10604.56] So characters will shift, events will unfold.
[10604.66 → 10608.08] It's kind of like watching a bunch of little stories happen in real time.
[10609.06 → 10611.54] Okay, take like two seconds to mention they sent you a puzzle.
[10611.54 → 10612.18] You did it with your kids?
[10612.22 → 10612.96] Yeah, it was this one.
[10613.10 → 10614.12] I did this one with my kids.
[10614.26 → 10614.84] It was lots of fun.
[10614.90 → 10616.28] It comes with the puzzle itself.
[10616.50 → 10617.52] There are some comics.
[10617.98 → 10624.96] There's like a fun, like a kind of checklist that you can do to find fun things.
[10624.96 → 10630.86] So you can do kind of like a hidden picture, or not hidden picture, but like a find the thing game.
[10630.98 → 10631.12] Whatever.
[10631.22 → 10631.84] I don't know what they're called.
[10631.90 → 10637.52] The point is, it was more fun than just doing a regular puzzle because there was actually something to do with it at the end.
[10637.52 → 10641.74] And it's a great way to get the family involved in one activity this Christmas or New Year's.
[10641.94 → 10648.46] So if you're ready for a puzzle like no other, get 15% off your first order using our link in the video description.
[10648.58 → 10649.04] What was that?
[10649.46 → 10650.16] Okay, cool.
[10650.66 → 10651.00] Neat.
[10651.00 → 10652.74] Thank you, Proton, and...
[10652.74 → 10653.68] It's about family.
[10656.02 → 10656.42] Yeah.
[10656.78 → 10657.60] I mean, I get it.
[10657.94 → 10658.30] Yeah.
[10658.46 → 10658.92] That's a meme.
[10659.24 → 10659.58] It is.
[10659.68 → 10662.30] You're probably not chronically online enough to know the meme.
[10662.44 → 10662.72] Wow.
[10663.22 → 10664.42] Fast in the family.
[10664.64 → 10665.36] It references back.
[10665.36 → 10666.28] Fast in the family.
[10666.94 → 10667.92] Cats, by the way.
[10667.94 → 10668.62] Drive car.
[10669.00 → 10670.72] Cats did a really great reminder.
[10670.84 → 10672.38] LEG.GG slash New egg.
[10672.46 → 10673.30] We're doing a check.
[10673.86 → 10674.42] B580s.
[10674.80 → 10675.66] Can you get the...
[10675.66 → 10677.74] Is there one under MSRP?
[10678.34 → 10678.78] 239.
[10678.86 → 10679.62] Another one down here.
[10679.80 → 10680.28] 239.
[10680.34 → 10681.38] What's our affiliate link again?
[10682.92 → 10684.88] LEG.GG slash New egg.
[10684.92 → 10686.02] LEG.GG slash New egg.
[10686.02 → 10687.50] I'm pretty sure these are going to still have that bundle, right?
[10687.50 → 10688.12] Do they still have the deal?
[10688.24 → 10688.82] Do they have the deal?
[10690.04 → 10690.32] No.
[10690.72 → 10691.30] There's no deal.
[10691.30 → 10692.12] I don't see.
[10692.22 → 10693.34] They don't have the game bundle.
[10693.46 → 10694.64] I thought it was supposed to still be running, though.
[10695.70 → 10697.40] It's always while quantities last.
[10697.52 → 10698.94] We probably sold them all last week.
[10699.40 → 10701.22] Ah, got it.
[10701.40 → 10701.72] Okay.
[10702.06 → 10703.62] Like, I'm willing to bet that if...
[10703.62 → 10708.00] I could just see 3DMark with this, which is definitely not Battlefield 6 and whatever
[10708.00 → 10708.78] the other games were.
[10709.86 → 10710.32] Like, here.
[10710.38 → 10710.96] Check this out.
[10712.06 → 10720.30] I bet if I go to, like, a lesser-known retailer or something, they will probably have it.
[10720.30 → 10720.54] Yeah.
[10720.64 → 10720.76] See?
[10720.92 → 10722.04] So, like, Canada Computers.
[10722.48 → 10723.28] Gift Code Redemption.
[10723.52 → 10723.70] Oh.
[10723.70 → 10726.58] Because the promo's still running, but I talked about this last week.
[10726.58 → 10726.62] Wait, wait, wait.
[10726.78 → 10728.00] Is that a Canadian promo?
[10728.12 → 10730.90] Because I'm looking at specifically the America.
[10730.90 → 10736.58] Well, I don't know any America retailers that are not New egg, so it'd be hard for me to
[10736.58 → 10736.78] check.
[10736.86 → 10743.28] But if they still had smaller retailers, then I pretty much guarantee that while supplies
[10743.28 → 10746.60] last, they would have stock of the promo, because New egg did run out of them, and then
[10746.60 → 10747.46] they did restock them.
[10747.62 → 10749.52] So, they have a cost, right?
[10749.52 → 10754.98] Like, Intel has to buy more copies of these games, so they don't just run them forever.
[10756.16 → 10756.52] Yeah.
[10756.72 → 10757.50] That makes sense.
[10757.62 → 10758.82] And you know what else doesn't run forever?
[10759.48 → 10760.82] This show.
