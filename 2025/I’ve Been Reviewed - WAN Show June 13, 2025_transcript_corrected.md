[0.32 → 1.78] Hey there, is your monitor running?
[3.04 → 4.44] You should go out and catch it!
[4.70 → 6.08] Welcome to the WAN Show!
[6.58 → 8.74] We've got a great show lined up for you guys!
[9.28 → 10.56] We're going to be talking about
[10.56 → 12.84] Microsoft's big foray
[12.84 → 15.16] into handheld gaming, or should I say
[15.16 → 16.48] small
[16.48 → 18.74] small little step, little step
[18.74 → 20.78] put pinky toe in water
[20.78 → 22.48] We're also going to be talking about
[22.48 → 24.72] Apple's jam-packed
[24.72 → 26.24] WWDC, which
[26.24 → 27.90] I have to say,
[27.90 → 30.46] I wasn't involved in the creation of this video
[30.46 → 32.70] so I'm going to say two things real quick
[32.70 → 34.56] One, great
[34.56 → 35.68] job team!
[36.18 → 37.90] I watched the finished output
[37.90 → 40.34] and I was just like, no notes
[40.34 → 42.60] upload it. Freaking awesome
[42.60 → 44.16] And then, number two
[44.16 → 46.34] great job Apple
[46.34 → 48.28] I watched the video
[48.28 → 50.92] no notes, send it
[50.92 → 52.56] What else we got this week?
[52.92 → 54.30] We got reviewed
[54.30 → 56.88] Oh, we did. Our products
[56.88 → 58.16] We did. A few of them
[58.16 → 59.20] We actually got
[59.20 → 60.68] We got reviewed twice
[60.68 → 61.84] More than that
[61.84 → 62.24] Really?
[62.34 → 64.22] Do you know about the backpack comparison?
[64.40 → 64.58] No
[64.58 → 65.44] Us versus Ridge?
[65.54 → 66.20] Yeah, oh dude
[66.20 → 67.54] What the heck?
[67.58 → 69.06] We get reviewed a lot lately
[69.06 → 70.20] I don't know what's going on
[70.20 → 71.66] It's almost like we make a bunch of products
[71.66 → 73.28] and people are like
[73.28 → 74.72] Oh, well we should review them
[74.72 → 75.32] That's wild
[75.32 → 77.24] Also, the second most important thing
[77.24 → 78.62] on this entire doc
[78.62 → 80.52] is that Space balls 2 was announced
[80.52 → 106.26] The show is brought to you today by
[106.26 → 107.14] Messi
[107.14 → 108.48] Odom
[108.48 → 109.84] And delete me
[109.84 → 111.26] And of course, as usual
[111.26 → 112.46] Our wrap partner is brand
[112.46 → 114.76] Our laptop partner is dell
[114.76 → 116.26] And our chair partner is
[116.26 → 118.18] I always lean the wrong way
[118.18 → 120.20] I always lean like it's a mirror
[120.20 → 121.44] But it's a camera feed
[121.44 → 123.14] Secret lab
[123.14 → 125.30] Alright, should we jump right into
[125.30 → 126.68] Shift Fashion Group
[126.68 → 128.28] Reviewing our clothing
[128.28 → 130.22] If you guys missed it
[130.22 → 131.46] Shift Fashion Group
[131.46 → 133.54] A creator known for breaking down clothing
[133.54 → 134.72] from big retail brands
[134.72 → 136.54] Reviewed some LTT store merch
[136.54 → 138.96] They had a lot to say
[138.96 → 140.44] about our t-shirts in particular
[140.44 → 141.86] And our fashion team
[141.86 → 143.42] is going to be doing a React video
[143.42 → 145.18] to share their expert thoughts
[145.18 → 146.80] You guys are going to be able to catch that soon
[146.80 → 147.96] on Float plane
[147.96 → 150.32] And because we didn't want there to be
[150.32 → 152.12] a perception that this is like
[152.12 → 153.26] something we're trying to
[153.26 → 154.66] paywall our response to
[154.66 → 156.62] That's going to be a rare
[156.62 → 157.70] Float plane exclusive
[157.70 → 159.44] that is also going to go up on
[159.44 → 160.56] LMG Clips
[160.56 → 162.56] So our WAN Show Clips channel
[162.56 → 165.72] That's where we do put exclusives sometimes
[165.72 → 167.40] We're just doing it right away
[167.40 → 168.34] We're just doing it
[168.34 → 169.82] I don't know if it'll be right away
[169.82 → 170.14] right away
[170.14 → 170.96] but it'll be very soon
[170.96 → 171.40] Gotcha
[171.40 → 172.50] So we're going to put it up there
[172.50 → 174.00] so you guys can check out their response
[174.00 → 176.22] I'm actually very
[176.22 → 177.52] I'm really interested in seeing their response
[177.52 → 178.78] I'm very excited to watch it
[178.78 → 180.70] because I didn't have a merch meeting this week
[180.70 → 182.44] They're only every other week
[182.44 → 183.50] So I haven't had a chance
[183.50 → 184.36] to talk to the team
[184.36 → 185.74] since Shift Fashion Group
[185.74 → 186.56] uploaded their video
[186.56 → 187.90] So that's going to be super cool
[187.90 → 188.34] Cool
[188.34 → 189.66] They also had some really
[189.66 → 190.22] Fairly it is right away
[190.22 → 190.70] They had some
[190.70 → 191.50] Okay, there you go
[191.50 → 193.10] Oh, it will also not
[193.10 → 194.38] Haha, got them
[194.38 → 196.18] It will also not take up
[196.18 → 197.34] an exclusive upload slot
[197.34 → 198.52] This is what it's like, isn't it?
[198.60 → 198.80] Yeah
[198.80 → 200.04] It's terrible
[200.04 → 200.46] Yeah
[200.46 → 203.02] You get used to it
[203.02 → 206.22] They also had some really positive things
[206.22 → 207.62] to say about our cargo pants
[207.62 → 208.20] which by the way
[208.20 → 209.04] I am wearing
[209.04 → 214.22] They actually tied for fourth place
[214.22 → 215.18] all time
[215.18 → 216.34] on the channel's leaderboard
[216.34 → 217.80] They were very pleased
[217.80 → 219.14] with the task jacket too
[219.14 → 220.52] both of which are newer
[220.52 → 222.36] more recently developed garments
[222.36 → 224.60] so I'm very excited then
[224.60 → 225.36] about the direction
[225.36 → 226.26] that our team's going
[226.26 → 228.68] and our discussion topic today
[228.68 → 229.68] is
[229.68 → 231.16] you know
[231.16 → 232.04] how does it feel
[232.04 → 232.60] I guess
[232.60 → 233.66] to even be
[233.66 → 234.68] considered
[234.68 → 235.28] Yeah
[235.28 → 236.58] in the same conversation
[236.58 → 238.82] as major brands
[238.82 → 240.32] like Uniqlo
[240.32 → 240.68] I mean
[240.68 → 242.24] we've always had a goal
[242.24 → 244.38] of creating products
[244.38 → 245.62] rather than
[245.62 → 245.96] you know
[245.96 → 247.08] creator merch
[247.08 → 249.02] and I think that
[249.02 → 250.14] if we were to go back
[250.14 → 250.72] and look
[250.72 → 252.08] at our earliest attempts
[252.08 → 252.74] I mean
[252.74 → 253.14] even
[253.14 → 254.42] even something like
[254.42 → 255.18] the water bottle
[255.18 → 255.98] you know
[255.98 → 257.14] ignoring the
[257.14 → 258.28] the refined
[258.28 → 259.30] you know
[259.30 → 260.74] more easily cleanable
[260.74 → 261.80] not to mention
[261.80 → 266.26] more rugged clip
[266.26 → 267.32] version of the
[267.32 → 267.84] of the
[267.84 → 268.52] of the top
[268.52 → 269.16] that we've
[269.16 → 270.18] that we have created
[270.18 → 270.78] more recently
[270.78 → 272.08] this is just
[272.08 → 274.04] an existing water bottle design
[274.04 → 275.44] and I literally
[275.44 → 276.74] like we have a lost and found
[276.74 → 277.52] at Smash Champs
[277.52 → 278.32] the badminton centre
[278.32 → 279.32] where I get
[279.32 → 280.62] people leave water bottles
[280.62 → 281.06] all the time
[281.06 → 282.06] because it's a sports facility
[282.06 → 283.16] so I get to see
[283.16 → 284.12] all the different brands
[284.12 → 285.14] that are clearly
[285.14 → 286.76] using the exact same tooling
[286.76 → 287.58] for their water bottles
[287.58 → 288.38] like we just
[288.38 → 289.72] we just did a cool print
[289.72 → 290.84] on a water bottle
[290.84 → 291.22] you know
[291.22 → 291.86] you go back to our
[291.86 → 293.42] very early products
[293.42 → 293.88] even on the
[293.88 → 294.76] on the fashion side
[294.76 → 295.14] as well
[295.14 → 295.92] where we were just
[295.92 → 297.74] printing on top of
[297.74 → 298.86] off the shelf shirts
[298.86 → 299.54] and
[299.54 → 301.00] doing our best
[301.00 → 301.84] with things like
[301.84 → 303.02] the original stealth hoodie
[303.02 → 304.28] where they were okay
[304.28 → 305.90] but we've clearly
[305.90 → 306.60] learned a lot
[306.60 → 307.32] and you look at
[307.32 → 308.38] where we've come now
[308.38 → 310.58] the fact that we are
[310.58 → 312.86] even being looked at
[312.86 → 314.18] with the same level
[314.18 → 314.72] of scrutiny
[314.72 → 316.02] as big names
[316.02 → 316.52] in the industry
[316.52 → 317.70] honestly pretty exciting
[317.70 → 318.20] to me
[318.20 → 318.82] and
[318.82 → 320.54] I guess that's not
[320.54 → 321.64] really a discussion question
[321.64 → 322.40] I guess I kind of
[322.40 → 323.24] did all the discussion
[323.24 → 324.20] without really letting
[324.20 → 325.14] you get a word in edgewise
[325.14 → 326.06] this really is a
[326.06 → 327.24] this is a terrible show
[327.24 → 328.58] it's a terrible show
[328.58 → 329.82] I
[329.82 → 330.18] I
[330.18 → 330.72] just
[330.72 → 331.46] justice for Luke
[331.46 → 333.28] I just want to say
[333.28 → 333.60] that
[333.60 → 336.92] this isn't the type
[336.92 → 337.40] of content
[337.40 → 337.88] that I would
[337.88 → 338.34] necessarily
[338.34 → 339.06] personally
[339.06 → 339.94] spend a bunch of
[339.94 → 340.54] time watching
[340.54 → 341.20] on YouTube
[341.20 → 341.80] but I watched
[341.80 → 342.48] this whole video
[342.48 → 344.06] and not only
[344.06 → 344.56] was it like
[344.56 → 345.38] fascinating
[345.38 → 346.70] to see our stuff
[346.70 → 348.12] get looked at
[348.12 → 348.76] in this way
[348.76 → 349.32] because we've had
[349.32 → 350.12] we've had
[350.12 → 351.16] you know
[351.16 → 352.62] Project Farm
[352.62 → 353.48] did the
[353.48 → 354.44] screwdriver
[354.44 → 355.78] and the shirt
[355.78 → 356.24] I think
[356.24 → 356.96] did the shirt
[356.96 → 358.30] it was more ad hoc
[358.30 → 358.80] the shirt
[358.80 → 359.08] yeah
[359.08 → 360.08] well all of his stuff
[360.08 → 361.42] yeah I think
[361.42 → 362.10] there's definitely
[362.10 → 363.12] product categories
[363.12 → 363.96] that he has
[363.96 → 364.62] more
[364.62 → 366.74] domain knowledge
[366.74 → 367.94] that is applicable to
[367.94 → 368.42] sure
[368.42 → 368.76] yeah
[368.76 → 370.34] but it was fun
[370.34 → 370.96] seeing like
[370.96 → 371.58] actual
[371.58 → 372.74] people that are
[372.74 → 373.58] into this specific
[373.58 → 373.92] thing
[373.92 → 374.72] look at our
[374.72 → 375.34] clothing
[375.34 → 377.24] and not only
[377.24 → 377.76] was it
[377.76 → 378.78] kind of fun to watch
[378.78 → 379.12] but I think
[379.12 → 379.56] their hosting
[379.56 → 380.32] was really cool
[380.32 → 381.14] and
[381.14 → 382.82] sorry their hosting
[382.82 → 383.40] was really cool
[383.40 → 384.28] I thought the video
[384.28 → 384.74] was good
[384.74 → 385.32] and the host
[385.32 → 386.60] was good as well
[386.60 → 387.26] and it was just
[387.26 → 387.64] neat
[387.64 → 388.24] I'm actually
[388.24 → 388.72] like kind of
[388.72 → 389.30] interested in
[389.30 → 389.68] checking out
[389.68 → 390.04] more of this
[390.04 → 390.48] stuff because
[390.48 → 390.88] it was
[390.88 → 391.96] it was fun
[391.96 → 392.70] how educational
[392.70 → 393.16] it was
[393.16 → 394.24] like learned
[394.24 → 394.62] a bunch of
[394.62 → 394.84] stuff
[394.84 → 395.42] oh dude
[395.42 → 396.22] I love
[396.22 → 396.74] merch meeting
[396.74 → 397.26] oh yeah
[397.26 → 398.40] this felt
[398.40 → 398.74] like
[398.74 → 399.34] like my
[399.34 → 399.74] because I
[399.74 → 400.32] don't go to
[400.32 → 400.80] merch meeting
[400.80 → 401.44] so this felt
[401.44 → 401.88] like kind of
[401.88 → 402.58] that for me
[402.58 → 403.14] if that makes
[403.14 → 403.42] sense
[403.42 → 403.80] dude
[403.80 → 405.30] it's amazing
[405.30 → 405.76] how
[405.76 → 407.42] it's amazing
[407.42 → 408.06] how
[408.06 → 410.98] how perspective
[410.98 → 412.08] broadening it is
[412.08 → 413.08] to talk to
[413.08 → 413.96] experts in a
[413.96 → 414.48] field that you
[414.48 → 415.14] take for granted
[415.14 → 416.26] yeah
[416.26 → 417.28] so like I
[417.28 → 417.80] guarantee you
[417.80 → 418.32] here can you
[418.32 → 418.92] grab that white
[418.92 → 419.34] thing on the
[419.34 → 419.60] edge of the
[419.60 → 419.82] table
[419.82 → 420.96] I guarantee
[420.96 → 422.06] you that if
[422.06 → 423.36] you sat down
[423.36 → 424.20] with the
[424.20 → 425.56] scientists who
[425.56 → 426.62] determine the
[426.62 → 427.48] optimal freaking
[427.48 → 428.72] dimple pattern
[428.72 → 429.34] on this
[429.34 → 430.56] and you know
[430.56 → 431.86] the optimal
[431.86 → 432.98] size of this
[432.98 → 434.30] roll for you
[434.30 → 434.82] know the turn
[434.82 → 435.80] radius versus
[435.80 → 437.32] the number of
[437.32 → 438.04] layers and like
[438.04 → 438.96] what looks bigger
[438.96 → 439.68] to the consumer
[439.68 → 440.36] on the shelf
[440.36 → 441.24] and why are they
[441.24 → 441.66] this long
[441.66 → 442.94] there is so much
[442.94 → 444.08] thought and
[444.08 → 445.10] there's so much
[445.10 → 445.82] care and
[445.82 → 446.48] consideration
[446.48 → 447.78] and science
[447.78 → 449.00] that goes into
[449.00 → 449.80] the things around
[449.80 → 450.96] us that
[450.96 → 452.74] there 's's
[452.74 → 453.50] an unlimited
[453.50 → 454.58] capacity for
[454.58 → 455.20] for learning
[455.20 → 455.98] interesting things
[455.98 → 456.58] if you have a
[456.58 → 457.24] curious mind
[457.24 → 458.28] and one of
[458.28 → 458.82] the one of
[458.82 → 459.36] the big
[459.36 → 460.84] perspective changes
[460.84 → 461.84] I think for me
[461.84 → 462.74] as I've gotten
[462.74 → 463.60] older and as
[463.60 → 464.20] I've learned
[464.20 → 465.46] how little I
[465.46 → 466.18] know and
[466.18 → 467.06] not even that
[467.06 → 468.00] but how little
[468.00 → 468.92] I think
[468.92 → 470.56] about things
[470.56 → 471.04] like that
[471.04 → 471.60] that have been
[471.60 → 472.58] deeply considered
[472.58 → 475.40] the more
[475.40 → 476.68] understanding I
[476.68 → 477.48] am of the
[477.48 → 477.96] people in my
[477.96 → 478.56] life who don't
[478.56 → 479.00] give a shit
[479.00 → 479.54] about tech
[479.54 → 481.90] because there's
[481.90 → 482.58] stuff going on
[482.58 → 483.18] for them still
[483.18 → 484.00] because to me
[484.00 → 485.26] it's so obvious
[485.26 → 486.58] that I should
[486.58 → 487.92] know like how
[487.92 → 488.98] many FPS a
[488.98 → 489.78] graphics card
[489.78 → 490.90] might have
[490.90 → 491.70] before I buy
[491.70 → 492.70] it and that I
[492.70 → 493.56] should I should
[493.56 → 494.14] fundamentally
[494.14 → 495.26] understand the
[495.26 → 496.48] the design
[496.48 → 497.36] balance between
[497.36 → 498.96] cost and power
[498.96 → 499.96] consumption and
[499.96 → 501.06] how loud it is
[501.06 → 501.82] and how you
[501.82 → 502.68] know what it's
[502.68 → 503.34] going to fit in
[503.34 → 504.44] and all of these
[504.44 → 505.18] considerations
[505.18 → 507.80] but then I will
[507.80 → 508.68] I will need it
[508.68 → 509.54] I'll need a drill
[509.54 → 511.34] bit and I will
[511.34 → 512.30] literally just go to
[512.30 → 513.78] Rona, and I'll be
[513.78 → 514.64] like I don't know
[514.64 → 516.00] that one looks like
[516.00 → 516.78] it's made with good
[516.78 → 517.78] quality and I will
[517.78 → 518.40] take it home
[518.40 → 518.88] because it might
[518.88 → 519.46] work for the right
[519.46 → 520.56] materials and for
[520.56 → 522.76] me for me the way
[522.76 → 523.74] that I will use that
[523.74 → 525.34] drill bit I don't
[525.34 → 526.80] care it doesn't
[526.80 → 527.50] really matter
[527.50 → 527.82] they're going to
[527.82 → 528.28] use it enough
[528.28 → 529.90] times exactly I'm
[529.90 → 530.62] not I'm not a
[530.62 → 532.10] professional craftsman
[532.10 → 533.58] or whatever yeah so
[533.58 → 534.38] it doesn't really
[534.38 → 535.30] matter whereas if I'm
[535.30 → 535.90] the kind of person
[535.90 → 536.88] who uses my gaming
[536.88 → 539.04] PC a lot then I'm
[539.04 → 539.64] going to put I'm
[539.64 → 541.04] going to put my
[541.04 → 542.48] my points you know
[542.48 → 543.06] I'm going to put my
[543.06 → 543.94] character building
[543.94 → 545.26] points in my time
[545.26 → 547.24] points into that and
[547.24 → 548.32] it's made me it's
[548.32 → 549.56] made me a lot more
[549.56 → 551.12] understanding and a
[551.12 → 551.86] lot more
[551.86 → 556.00] it's made it easier I
[556.00 → 557.04] think for me to try
[557.04 → 559.24] to communicate the
[559.24 → 560.68] value except noobs
[560.68 → 562.46] no it's not that
[562.46 → 563.76] it's made if it's
[563.76 → 564.46] altered the way we've
[564.46 → 565.86] done our content is
[565.86 → 566.86] what I'll say yeah
[566.86 → 568.42] and we still
[568.42 → 569.70] want to do graphs you
[569.70 → 570.46] know we still want to
[570.46 → 571.22] do charts we still
[571.22 → 572.12] want to include numbers
[572.12 → 572.74] for the people who
[572.74 → 573.40] care about it but if
[573.40 → 574.52] you listen to what
[574.52 → 575.40] we're actually saying
[575.40 → 576.84] in the background we're
[576.84 → 577.80] kind of telling you
[577.80 → 579.26] what you pretty much
[579.26 → 580.44] need to know if you
[580.44 → 581.80] don't care about all
[581.80 → 584.12] of that because I'm, I'm
[584.12 → 585.66] a lot more open to
[585.66 → 586.98] the idea that you
[586.98 → 587.86] cannot care about
[587.86 → 588.60] that and that's
[588.60 → 589.92] actually okay yeah
[589.92 → 592.22] because and like
[592.22 → 594.20] dude if I had told my
[594.20 → 595.62] like forum dweller
[595.62 → 598.40] like 17-year-old self
[598.40 → 600.70] any of this he'd have
[600.70 → 602.42] been so mad he'd have
[602.42 → 603.36] written a thing like
[603.36 → 604.92] this long about how
[604.92 → 605.98] anyone who spends
[605.98 → 608.08] $30 more and gets
[608.08 → 610.92] 3% less should spend
[610.92 → 613.82] $30 less and get
[613.82 → 615.14] 3% more performance
[615.14 → 616.46] you did that other
[616.46 → 617.38] product is completely
[617.38 → 618.32] invalid to the point
[618.32 → 618.74] where it shouldn't
[618.74 → 620.02] even exist we should
[620.02 → 620.92] only have the one
[620.92 → 622.34] that's like the better
[622.34 → 623.82] choice, and it's like
[623.82 → 627.98] like seriously dude
[627.98 → 629.04] I'd get back in like
[629.04 → 630.34] the Athlon
[630.34 → 632.78] 64 days okay like I
[632.78 → 634.56] would actually get upset
[634.56 → 636.04] at people who bought a
[636.04 → 639.18] Pentium D and just bought
[639.18 → 640.38] a Pentium D because they
[640.38 → 641.78] like Intel, and I'm
[641.78 → 644.38] like to it's so hot
[644.38 → 645.46] and I literally would
[645.46 → 646.38] see this years later
[646.38 → 648.30] like it's so hot it is
[648.30 → 649.20] going to discolour the
[649.20 → 650.08] back of your motherboard
[650.08 → 651.46] socket from how
[651.46 → 652.56] flipping hot this thing
[652.56 → 654.06] is the performance is
[654.06 → 656.42] worse and Intel in with
[656.42 → 657.40] the arrogance they had
[657.40 → 658.40] back then didn't
[658.40 → 660.14] discount at all there
[660.14 → 661.06] it was just more
[661.06 → 662.84] expensive hotter and
[662.84 → 666.02] worse it's like your
[666.02 → 668.02] decision is invalid is
[668.02 → 669.30] what was my
[669.30 → 671.04] attitude back then and
[671.04 → 672.02] these days I'm a lot
[672.02 → 673.54] more dude I'm so much
[673.54 → 675.42] more just you know
[675.42 → 676.60] what like people ask me
[676.60 → 677.38] what phone should I buy
[677.38 → 678.38] and I'm you should buy a
[678.38 → 680.64] phone you'd like you
[680.64 → 681.00] know it's been
[681.00 → 682.48] interesting um there I
[682.48 → 682.70] don't know if you're a
[682.70 → 684.16] more opinionated bit about
[684.16 → 686.48] Apple I was about to get
[686.48 → 687.98] into Apple I don't think
[687.98 → 689.60] the first video is out
[689.60 → 690.72] yet, but we are doing a
[690.72 → 692.18] switch to iPhone challenge
[692.18 → 694.44] for lifelong Android users
[694.44 → 697.54] and my wife going back to
[697.54 → 699.42] I think the original
[699.42 → 701.30] Samsung Galaxy like before
[701.30 → 703.72] it was called S or one or
[703.72 → 705.62] anything was it S I can't
[705.62 → 707.68] remember I'm pretty no I
[707.68 → 708.32] think maybe it was a
[708.32 → 711.18] Galaxy 2 whatever she
[711.18 → 713.12] has been a Samsung Android
[713.12 → 716.34] user for literally like as
[716.34 → 718.36] long as Galaxy phones have
[718.36 → 721.72] existed um, and she's gone
[721.72 → 724.72] iPhone, and it's been very
[724.72 → 726.36] interesting hearing her
[726.36 → 728.04] perspective as someone who
[728.04 → 729.26] has tried it before she
[729.26 → 730.84] actually gave it a shot like
[730.84 → 732.24] five or six years ago I was
[732.24 → 732.94] like you should try an
[732.94 → 734.20] iPhone just see how you like
[734.20 → 737.76] it, and she hated it, and I'm
[737.76 → 739.78] not gonna spoil too much but
[739.78 → 741.38] I will say that it's a
[741.38 → 742.60] different experience than
[742.60 → 743.92] last time interesting very
[743.92 → 745.18] interesting the most eye
[745.18 → 746.08] opening part for me, I've
[746.08 → 746.74] talked about this on WAN
[746.74 → 748.88] before but uh my mom had
[748.88 → 750.78] to switch from we were
[750.78 → 752.06] like we were an
[752.06 → 753.26] Android household you know
[753.26 → 754.66] uh everybody had Android
[754.66 → 756.60] phones Android house yeah
[756.60 → 757.44] and then we're not real
[757.44 → 758.52] people she're just
[758.52 → 760.92] Androids she had to get an
[760.92 → 763.30] iPhone for work uh and she
[763.30 → 764.50] got it and just watching
[764.50 → 767.64] the adoption curve like
[767.64 → 768.98] knowing where she was at
[768.98 → 769.98] with Android which was like
[769.98 → 772.24] you know functional eh
[772.24 → 774.96] that's about there and then
[774.96 → 776.66] watching within like a day or
[776.66 → 778.94] two on iPhone yeah like she
[778.94 → 780.00] used she used to do things
[780.00 → 782.66] that would have taken time
[782.66 → 783.96] for me to try to figure out
[783.96 → 784.76] how to do, and she would do
[784.76 → 786.72] them accidentally um like how
[786.72 → 788.52] she used to send emails that
[788.52 → 789.58] were text messages all the
[789.58 → 791.10] time and like all this stuff
[791.10 → 792.00] I'm like man I don't even
[792.00 → 792.90] know how you figured out how
[792.90 → 794.52] to do this uh and then she
[794.52 → 795.52] goes on to an iPhone and
[795.52 → 797.10] it's just everything just
[797.10 → 798.48] kind of clicked right away
[798.48 → 800.42] and it's like okay maybe it's
[800.42 → 801.50] not worse it's just not
[801.50 → 803.44] really made for me that's
[803.44 → 805.92] okay um that took a bit for
[805.92 → 808.10] me to accept Nexus S was or
[808.10 → 809.14] Nexus 5 are you saying
[809.14 → 812.22] Nexus S was an amazing
[812.22 → 813.76] freaking device I will say
[813.76 → 815.66] uh Ragùs there are certain
[815.66 → 817.40] things about the sort of the
[817.40 → 818.98] iPhone argument that I just
[818.98 → 820.58] can't get behind so Ragùs
[820.58 → 821.50] says do you still have an
[821.50 → 823.52] iPhone I message FaceTime is
[823.52 → 827.92] super nice um no I'm sorry
[827.92 → 829.14] I just I kind of flatly
[829.14 → 830.58] reject that because any
[830.58 → 832.20] communication platform that
[832.20 → 833.88] is not compatible with
[833.88 → 834.80] everyone in your life
[834.80 → 835.78] regardless of how much
[835.78 → 836.80] money they have to spend on
[836.80 → 838.58] their phone is not a good
[838.58 → 840.20] communication platform like
[840.20 → 843.90] if we imagine when
[843.90 → 845.30] the know the telephone
[845.30 → 847.76] the landline telephone
[847.76 → 849.84] network was you know built up
[849.84 → 851.18] you know when when when I was
[851.18 → 853.08] a kid in the 90s if I
[853.08 → 856.82] literally like had a degraded
[856.82 → 858.52] call experience with some of
[858.52 → 859.68] my friends because their
[859.68 → 862.76] parents like didn't have the
[862.76 → 865.58] like BC tell you know line
[865.58 → 868.14] they had the whatever line
[868.14 → 868.96] and just like what are you
[868.96 → 871.02] even talking about the fact
[871.02 → 872.18] that I message at least
[872.18 → 874.12] supports RCS, so there's
[874.12 → 875.60] there's encryption and
[875.60 → 877.62] there's like rich media
[877.62 → 880.00] support cross-platform now
[880.00 → 881.04] you know sure you like I
[881.04 → 882.14] message sure I don't care
[882.14 → 883.42] whatever use I've met sure
[883.42 → 884.76] you like it that's great go
[884.76 → 888.06] for it, but FaceTime has
[888.06 → 891.46] created an environment where
[891.46 → 892.66] like I have relatives for
[892.66 → 893.94] instance who love FaceTime
[893.94 → 895.70] well guess what I don't use
[895.70 → 897.22] an iPhone, and now I have to
[897.22 → 898.70] train them to use something
[898.70 → 901.26] else because Apple knows that
[901.26 → 902.40] if they build cross-platform
[902.40 → 903.72] compatibility into FaceTime
[903.72 → 905.08] that there will be absolutely
[905.08 → 908.28] no reason to care about the
[908.28 → 911.40] iPhone's FaceTime and no lock-in
[911.40 → 914.10] so now I have to go and train
[914.10 → 915.32] them how to use another app
[915.32 → 917.58] when realistically if an is
[917.58 → 918.96] Apple was willing to make it
[918.96 → 920.98] cross-platform or if
[920.98 → 922.06] something else was the norm
[922.06 → 923.32] something that just was
[923.32 → 924.70] cross-platform we just
[924.70 → 926.30] wouldn't have this problem I
[926.30 → 928.26] love technology as a solution
[928.26 → 930.08] to a problem I don't love it
[930.08 → 932.30] as the creation of a problem
[932.30 → 935.94] and FaceTime is both it is the
[935.94 → 937.66] solution to a problem it is
[937.66 → 940.50] built-in convenient video
[940.50 → 941.96] messaging or video calling
[941.96 → 944.88] which is great that's so
[944.88 → 947.30] awesome breaking down the
[947.30 → 948.72] barriers especially for
[948.72 → 949.60] families that are
[949.60 → 951.66] geographically dispersed for
[951.66 → 953.38] for video face-to-face
[953.38 → 955.70] communication was hugely
[955.70 → 957.82] beneficial like to the world
[957.82 → 960.44] Skype changed the world like
[960.44 → 962.28] in a big way, and it changed
[962.28 → 963.90] our ability to have
[963.90 → 965.28] relationships with people who
[965.28 → 966.54] are at great distances from
[966.54 → 968.20] each other classic Microsoft
[968.20 → 969.78] changed the world with a
[969.78 → 970.84] communication service and
[970.84 → 972.48] then just do nothing with it
[972.48 → 974.16] and then close it down later
[974.16 → 977.32] on yeah but then it also
[977.32 → 979.76] creates this cross-platform
[979.76 → 982.08] incompatibility issue that can
[982.08 → 983.62] only be solved with a multi
[983.62 → 985.16] hundreds of dollars purchase
[985.82 → 991.12] no that's f***ed up so I
[991.12 → 992.86] respect the good things that
[992.86 → 994.24] Apple has done with FaceTime and
[994.24 → 996.40] iMessage, but I completely do not
[996.40 → 999.50] respect the lockdown the
[999.50 → 1002.94] walled garden the the know
[1002.94 → 1004.96] this kid is ostracized because
[1004.96 → 1006.40] they don't have the right brand
[1006.40 → 1008.38] of phone and therefore their
[1008.38 → 1009.92] messages you know screw up the
[1009.92 → 1012.18] group chat use a different f***ING
[1012.18 → 1014.50] group chat then like I'm sorry
[1014.50 → 1017.38] but I don't I don't view you know
[1017.38 → 1020.48] what computer someone uses as a
[1020.48 → 1022.92] valid reason that someone should be
[1022.92 → 1025.22] should be ostracized or should be
[1025.22 → 1028.20] thought anything of in any way like
[1028.20 → 1030.74] it's its it's comical if it wasn't
[1030.74 → 1031.60] actually happening
[1031.60 → 1037.04] that was an unplanned topic
[1037.04 → 1043.80] oh yeah it's not a bad option yeah
[1043.80 → 1045.78] we could talk about WWDC now because
[1045.78 → 1047.66] there's a lot of really cool stuff
[1047.66 → 1050.26] that's going on from WWDC like this is
[1050.26 → 1052.44] like three pages of the doc to the
[1052.44 → 1053.24] point where I don't think we're
[1053.24 → 1054.30] going to be able to talk through all
[1054.30 → 1056.70] of it I don't I don't really think I
[1056.70 → 1058.26] need to touch on liquid glass too
[1058.26 → 1060.40] much it's basically transparency in
[1060.40 → 1062.90] the interface it's its Windows vista
[1062.90 → 1065.20] era arrow excuse me I think it's sick
[1065.20 → 1068.32] which apparently Microsoft like kind of
[1068.32 → 1069.90] took a little dig at them but
[1069.90 → 1073.02] honestly Microsoft I think your dig
[1073.02 → 1076.22] was ill-conceived and the reason for
[1076.22 → 1079.64] that is that if you knew that arrow was
[1079.64 → 1081.52] so great why do you bend why'd you
[1081.52 → 1083.64] ever abandon it why did you ever do
[1083.64 → 1085.54] the monstrosity that was Windows 8 and
[1085.54 → 1089.96] 8.1 arrow was king, and you know what
[1089.96 → 1094.38] now the king is back but on Apple how
[1094.38 → 1096.72] could you let this happen Microsoft how
[1096.72 → 1098.92] could you let this happen glass looks so
[1098.92 → 1102.46] good I really like it there are some
[1102.46 → 1104.38] people saying that the accessibility
[1104.38 → 1106.86] could be a concern it could be less
[1106.86 → 1108.70] readable I think that's a valid
[1108.70 → 1111.08] concern hopefully Apple can address
[1111.08 → 1112.56] this through the accessibility menu
[1112.56 → 1114.26] maybe they could, you could play around
[1114.26 → 1116.82] with the transparency it seems pretty
[1116.82 → 1118.98] easy to solve I don't know if they'll
[1118.98 → 1120.48] do it, but it seems pretty easy to solve
[1120.48 → 1122.96] at one thing Apple does do very
[1122.96 → 1126.50] well is had really common sense
[1126.50 → 1128.32] features for their phones buried eight
[1128.32 → 1130.28] menus deep in the accessibility menu
[1130.28 → 1134.16] nice so if you actually have like a
[1134.16 → 1137.10] real device use problem there is a
[1137.10 → 1138.96] strong possibility that it's sitting
[1138.96 → 1141.38] there in accessibility for you to for
[1141.38 → 1145.02] you to get taken care of CarPlay oh man
[1145.02 → 1148.46] CarPlay looks a lot better I think both
[1148.46 → 1152.36] Android Auto and CarPlay are due for
[1152.36 → 1154.84] this kind of or maybe even more
[1154.84 → 1156.36] reimagining like there's one thing that
[1156.36 → 1159.32] still drives me crazy on Android Auto I
[1159.32 → 1161.74] can't just I can't just set and lock
[1161.74 → 1164.24] what my four like favourite icons are in
[1164.24 → 1165.86] the bottom as far as I know you guys
[1165.86 → 1167.42] feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on
[1167.42 → 1169.84] this, but it's just my four most recent I
[1169.84 → 1171.64] don't actually want me to want the four
[1171.64 → 1174.64] that I want the most, and then I want to
[1174.64 → 1176.34] press the button to go to like my
[1176.34 → 1178.12] apps menu that's the other thing too is
[1178.12 → 1180.26] it uses the same button to go split
[1180.26 → 1182.90] screen and then to go to your all apps
[1182.90 → 1187.26] menu why that's wacky, so I have to press
[1187.26 → 1188.80] it twice if I want to anyway
[1188.80 → 1192.18] sebascontre I don't know I in full
[1192.18 → 1193.96] plane chat said in beta one there's
[1193.96 → 1195.48] already a reduced transparency option
[1195.48 → 1196.92] and accessibility they're already
[1196.92 → 1198.42] solving it there you go don't stress
[1198.42 → 1200.78] so yeah CarPlay getting a phone call
[1200.78 → 1202.52] no longer consumes the entire screen and
[1202.52 → 1205.10] they're going to have widgets oh
[1205.10 → 1207.86] nice are you kidding me again Vista
[1207.86 → 1212.10] innovation let's go yeah let's go CarPlay
[1212.10 → 1215.36] ultra is a vastly more integrated car
[1215.36 → 1217.06] infotainment system blah blah blah blah
[1217.06 → 1220.54] who cares Aston Martin looks like it's
[1220.54 → 1222.08] going to be the exclusive launch partner
[1222.08 → 1224.92] for it in North America so okay so
[1224.92 → 1226.80] who cares four people will get it yeah
[1226.80 → 1231.62] honestly I am extremely over this
[1231.62 → 1234.26] concept of taking the computers that we
[1234.26 → 1238.12] already had in our pockets and having
[1238.12 → 1240.22] our cars have a redundant computer that
[1240.22 → 1242.00] runs functionally the same operating
[1242.00 → 1244.58] system the whole CarPlay Android Auto
[1244.58 → 1248.84] thing wireless casting is peak
[1248.84 → 1252.80] car data integration in my opinion and
[1252.80 → 1256.82] any move towards any move away from that I
[1256.82 → 1259.58] am I am strongly opposed to at this point
[1259.58 → 1262.48] I'm sorry I just I can't get behind this
[1262.48 → 1265.68] I mean if CarPlay this I don't know will
[1265.68 → 1270.26] a CarPlay ultra car support Android Auto
[1270.26 → 1273.00] because you I like you can get a car that
[1273.00 → 1275.78] has Android automotive my wife's new car
[1275.78 → 1278.28] has Android automotive so it actually runs
[1278.28 → 1281.34] Android natively, but you can still CarPlay
[1281.34 → 1282.26] to it
[1282.26 → 1288.64] let's see anyone does anyone know I don't
[1288.64 → 1290.86] see anyone in chat so we'll have to see how
[1290.86 → 1295.72] it goes what else we got now there's a
[1295.72 → 1297.22] bunch of new Apple intelligence stuff
[1297.22 → 1300.82] live translation of on-screen content
[1300.82 → 1304.06] not cool that's cool visual intelligence
[1304.06 → 1305.40] will look at stuff on your screen tell
[1305.40 → 1307.36] you information about if it's basically
[1307.36 → 1310.00] Google ends yep call screening
[1310.00 → 1311.98] Apple finally has call screening dude
[1311.98 → 1315.52] that's actually I that's the coolest
[1315.52 → 1317.04] announcement from this event I think my
[1317.04 → 1319.48] pixel 9a aside from the outstanding
[1319.48 → 1321.48] battery life haven't been too happy with
[1321.48 → 1323.64] if it's I have often issues where my
[1323.64 → 1325.56] keyboard doesn't come up where my voice
[1325.56 → 1327.08] dictation thing doesn't come up I have
[1327.08 → 1328.66] to like close the app and reopen it or
[1328.66 → 1330.26] like go to a different one and reopen
[1330.26 → 1334.30] it my ambient light detector my ambient
[1334.30 → 1336.26] light sensors like all over the place a
[1336.84 → 1338.96] lot often especially in like one of my
[1338.96 → 1340.74] bathrooms at home which you know if
[1340.74 → 1342.70] you're anything like me the can is
[1342.70 → 1344.16] somewhere you one of your primary phone
[1344.16 → 1346.68] time frequently use your phone yeah so
[1346.68 → 1347.54] it's pretty annoying to have my
[1347.54 → 1350.36] brightness going like nobody else is
[1350.36 → 1351.54] going to do those chess puzzles for you
[1351.54 → 1354.98] but the one thing keeping me from just
[1354.98 → 1356.80] being like screw this I'm gonna you know
[1356.80 → 1358.88] get a new Samsung fold or something is
[1358.88 → 1362.32] the call screening dude game changer
[1362.32 → 1365.16] because for years like my phone number
[1365.16 → 1367.76] is, and I'm just going to mute my ringer now
[1367.76 → 1371.40] because it always makes some dumbass go
[1371.40 → 1373.42] look for it, but my phone number is not
[1373.42 → 1375.70] hard to find in fact most prominent
[1375.70 → 1378.52] people's phone numbers not hard to find
[1378.52 → 1382.36] not hard to find epic video and so for
[1382.36 → 1384.70] years now I just don't answer my phone so
[1384.70 → 1385.96] don't even bother because I literally
[1385.96 → 1388.36] won't answer my phone but what the call
[1388.36 → 1390.52] screening feature has done is it has
[1390.52 → 1393.52] enabled me to not miss calls from
[1393.52 → 1396.14] actual people who need to reach me, so I
[1396.14 → 1397.88] will I'll have packages returned to sender
[1397.88 → 1401.08] I'll miss appointments like on a semiregular
[1401.08 → 1404.32] basis because every single time I've
[1404.32 → 1405.92] changed my phone number in the past it
[1405.92 → 1408.56] has like immediately leaked again oh yeah
[1408.56 → 1409.92] so I think there's just someone who works
[1409.92 → 1413.30] at a carrier or at some somewhere that
[1413.30 → 1415.12] they have access to just like the
[1415.12 → 1416.88] nationwide cell phone directory or
[1416.88 → 1419.74] something that just uploads it or
[1419.74 → 1421.30] something I don't I don't know I don't
[1421.30 → 1423.48] know how to happen but the very last time
[1423.48 → 1425.68] it wasn't that I leaked it which had
[1425.68 → 1428.36] happened before that if we just appeared
[1428.36 → 1430.34] in one of these databases, and I was like
[1430.34 → 1431.24] well you know what I'm just not gonna
[1431.24 → 1432.72] bother any more I'm just not going to answer
[1432.72 → 1435.24] my phone but with call screening I can
[1435.24 → 1437.52] answer my phone yeah and I can mostly
[1437.52 → 1439.20] not because most of the time it's
[1439.20 → 1441.22] nothing yes which is pretty sick yeah
[1441.22 → 1442.98] love it loves call screening yeah I will
[1442.98 → 1444.70] not get a phone that does not have call
[1444.70 → 1446.00] screening at this point yeah it makes
[1446.00 → 1448.12] sense it is the considering all foreign
[1448.12 → 1453.76] all phones are becoming so samey it's
[1453.76 → 1457.38] like it's a must-have feature I'm super
[1457.38 → 1459.72] into this next one hold detection so
[1459.72 → 1461.82] it'll be able to tell the difference if
[1461.82 → 1463.56] music's playing or not honestly though
[1463.56 → 1466.38] music playing or not doesn't is not my
[1466.38 → 1469.20] main issue because I have no problem
[1469.20 → 1470.82] just putting my phone aside or putting
[1470.82 → 1472.74] an ear putting an earphone in and just
[1472.74 → 1474.00] leaving it in my pocket and just like
[1474.00 → 1477.90] going about my day the only time it
[1477.90 → 1479.88] bugs me is when they have a recorded
[1479.88 → 1482.70] message that pops up thanks for staying
[1482.70 → 1485.04] on the line your call is important to us
[1485.04 → 1486.60] and we'll be getting to you in priority
[1486.60 → 1489.00] sequence hey have you checked out our
[1489.00 → 1492.60] recent promotions on shut up because
[1492.60 → 1495.54] every single time that plays I think oh
[1495.54 → 1498.28] it's a pro it's the bloody message
[1498.28 → 1499.80] especially when there's an annoyingly long
[1499.80 → 1503.94] pause after hey so what I wonder is if
[1503.94 → 1506.16] their hold detection will be able to
[1506.16 → 1509.04] account for that because that's what I
[1509.04 → 1512.46] need and if it can then I'm, so I do that
[1512.46 → 1514.40] could that could be iPhone switchable
[1514.40 → 1516.50] worthy and Adam has a note here which is
[1516.50 → 1517.70] would you actually be able to trust
[1517.70 → 1519.14] this every time I'm on hold the issue
[1519.14 → 1520.28] is important enough that I'm not going
[1520.28 → 1523.52] to risk messing up I think not always I
[1523.52 → 1524.90] don't think I would always trust it but
[1524.90 → 1526.56] there are definitely times when it's
[1526.56 → 1528.38] like you know if it screws up yeah I
[1528.38 → 1530.74] could call back yeah it's fine I just
[1530.74 → 1531.90] need to get in contact with these people
[1531.90 → 1535.46] like today not this second so yeah I
[1535.46 → 1537.00] would use it for sure just not all the
[1537.00 → 1539.34] time messages typing indicator for group
[1539.34 → 1541.60] chats Wow welcome to current year Adam
[1541.60 → 1543.28] thought is they didn't have this yeah
[1543.28 → 1544.66] this is my whole thing it's like I
[1544.66 → 1545.98] message is so great it's worth being on
[1545.98 → 1550.18] the iPhone no it isn't it's just dude
[1550.18 → 1553.66] text exchange applications are a utility
[1553.66 → 1558.84] at this point we can't, I can't, I'm
[1558.84 → 1562.68] sorry I can't new message screening moves
[1562.68 → 1564.36] unknown numbers to a separate inbox I'm
[1564.36 → 1566.92] yeah it's kind of cool payment via Apple
[1566.92 → 1569.54] cash and group chats actually that is
[1569.54 → 1571.92] amazing that's also pretty sick and would
[1571.92 → 1574.28] change the world if it didn't require
[1574.28 → 1578.18] everyone to have an iPhone, so I don't
[1578.18 → 1580.70] really care until another party does this
[1580.70 → 1583.18] and once they do then this is fantastic
[1583.18 → 1585.00] because literally none of my social
[1585.00 → 1587.58] groups use iMessage because literally
[1587.58 → 1589.64] all of my social groups have a mix of
[1589.64 → 1592.26] Android and Apple users so like say for
[1592.26 → 1594.24] example like my Saturday badminton
[1594.24 → 1596.46] group everyone pays for the session
[1596.46 → 1598.78] after the fact to the organizer, and it's
[1598.78 → 1600.28] like such a hassle for them to chase it
[1600.28 → 1603.56] down this doesn't solve the problem
[1603.56 → 1607.08] because we don't all have iPhones so as
[1607.08 → 1609.38] soon as a cross-platform this is a thing
[1609.38 → 1611.84] that's going to be sick people have pointed
[1612.40 → 1613.64] out in full-point chat that apparently
[1613.64 → 1616.64] pixels already have holds hold detection I
[1616.64 → 1618.12] didn't even know I did not know that
[1618.12 → 1619.50] either don't wait on hold that option
[1619.50 → 1622.74] often so yeah not any more I used to a lot
[1622.74 → 1624.80] more, but now I have a lot of help and
[1624.80 → 1627.34] that helps and also just email and web
[1627.34 → 1629.58] chats are like better these days yeah
[1629.58 → 1630.22] that's true
[1630.22 → 1639.20] okay no key says checked most auto
[1639.20 → 1641.76] manufacturers seems like a select few
[1641.76 → 1643.82] support both Android Auto and CarPlay
[1643.82 → 1646.56] simultaneously but are you talking I'm
[1646.56 → 1648.80] talking about CarPlay Ultra though lots
[1649.64 → 1652.52] of them support them both, but I'm
[1652.52 → 1654.06] talking about I'm talking about CarPlay
[1654.06 → 1656.58] Ultra will any of those with the deep
[1656.58 → 1658.20] integration with Apple in the
[1658.20 → 1659.70] infotainment system will they support
[1659.70 → 1666.90] Android Auto that I don't know all right
[1666.90 → 1668.94] you can keep IDs in your Apple Wallet in
[1668.94 → 1670.84] certain states that's super cool I
[1670.84 → 1673.20] actually lost my I lost my wallet I don't
[1673.20 → 1676.14] know if I told you that I'd be very
[1676.14 → 1678.40] annoying yeah I arrived at Vancouver
[1678.40 → 1683.00] airport and I went to get in my car this
[1683.00 → 1686.08] was after my trip for the
[1686.08 → 1690.02] Microsoft Xbox announcement, and I was
[1690.02 → 1693.42] like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna I don't
[1693.42 → 1695.28] know why I don't even know why I put my
[1695.28 → 1699.42] hand in my right pocket, but I was like oh
[1699.42 → 1703.16] my god I don't have my wallet my keys
[1703.16 → 1705.42] are in here my I have all my other things I
[1705.42 → 1709.26] have my loadout I don't have my wallet, so I
[1709.26 → 1711.24] had no like the last time I had used it
[1711.24 → 1714.00] was to buy something at Los Angeles
[1714.00 → 1718.12] International, so I either left it on the
[1718.12 → 1719.92] counter where I bought a breakfast burrito
[1719.92 → 1724.66] at LAX, or it was on the plane, or it was in
[1724.66 → 1727.28] YVR somewhere and no matter where of those
[1727.28 → 1729.68] places it was behind a security
[1729.68 → 1731.54] checkpoint that I could no longer cross
[1731.54 → 1735.94] so I filed lost and found reports with
[1735.94 → 1742.10] YVR LAX and United Airlines and I
[1742.10 → 1743.84] gotta say it's something I haven't done in
[1743.84 → 1746.58] a while and lost and founds have gotten
[1746.58 → 1750.18] better do you know how LAX does it you
[1750.18 → 1753.06] literally do not have to contact them you
[1753.06 → 1756.06] just go on the lost and found website you've
[1756.06 → 1759.24] put in what category of item it is there's a
[1759.24 → 1761.58] bunch of filters for like colours and
[1761.58 → 1764.34] description, and they just post pictures
[1764.34 → 1766.24] of everything they found
[1766.24 → 1771.38] how does how is that not rife for abuse
[1771.38 → 1773.16] well because you have to prove it's yours
[1773.16 → 1775.42] how do you do that through I tell them I
[1775.42 → 1776.76] tell them no, no no, no no you have to
[1776.76 → 1777.80] talk to someone to claim it
[1777.80 → 1781.28] oh yeah but to find out if they have
[1781.28 → 1783.46] select the item, and then you have to go
[1783.46 → 1784.34] through a person and then there's no
[1784.34 → 1786.98] there's pictures yeah yeah so
[1786.98 → 1788.52] you select it you'd be like that's mine
[1788.52 → 1790.34] yeah, and then you fill out a whole thing
[1790.34 → 1791.86] or something I don't know they didn't
[1791.86 → 1793.98] find if it was cool yeah no, no no, no
[1793.98 → 1795.26] yeah you have to you have to like do
[1795.26 → 1798.26] stuff to get it but like not having to
[1798.26 → 1799.58] because you're in that stressed out
[1799.58 → 1802.00] state of mind right so being able to
[1802.00 → 1803.56] just go look, and they say yeah it takes
[1803.56 → 1805.98] about up to 48 hours, but we just post it
[1805.98 → 1808.22] all here so you don't have to I don't
[1808.22 → 1810.38] know I thought it was cool anyway it was
[1810.38 → 1812.34] United Airlines that ended up finding it
[1812.34 → 1813.88] so I must have fallen out of my pocket
[1813.88 → 1815.52] or something when I was on the plane so
[1815.52 → 1819.02] I got it back, and it was only my
[1819.02 → 1821.98] most recent experience that made me
[1821.98 → 1824.94] wonder how it is that in present year
[1824.94 → 1827.34] we're still carrying around okay car keys
[1827.34 → 1829.52] is another one like the fact that when I
[1829.52 → 1831.34] when I drove the Tesla for a couple of weeks
[1831.34 → 1833.10] when I was doing the review of my in-laws
[1833.10 → 1834.94] car I was like this is amazing this is
[1834.94 → 1837.02] completely life-changing why did I ever
[1837.02 → 1839.00] carry keys this is awesome and then also
[1839.00 → 1842.76] wallets why do I have to why do I have
[1842.76 → 1846.18] to carry a certificate that I am licensed
[1846.18 → 1850.40] to drive a vehicle literally it made
[1850.40 → 1851.64] sense for a really long time yeah it
[1851.64 → 1853.50] made sense for a really long time but
[1853.50 → 1856.58] literally the cop pulled over behind me
[1856.58 → 1859.08] has a computer that and I know they have
[1859.08 → 1860.68] it because I literally see them using it
[1860.68 → 1862.20] while they're driving all the time
[1862.20 → 1866.42] distracted driving I'm loud yeah I know
[1866.42 → 1868.34] anyway they've got their computer there
[1868.34 → 1871.76] that has its photo ID it has a picture
[1871.76 → 1874.56] what is the difference what is that what
[1874.56 → 1876.54] is the difference I was still carrying my
[1876.54 → 1879.70] wallet you would two reasons I think
[1879.70 → 1881.90] really I don't trust myself to have my
[1881.90 → 1882.62] phone not be dead
[1882.62 → 1888.70] interesting also I have a pixel so it's
[1888.70 → 1890.94] pretty common the 9a fixes it dude my
[1890.94 → 1893.46] battery life's amazing now we'll see oh
[1893.46 → 1898.12] dude no it's its it's its iPhone like
[1898.12 → 1900.50] it's amazing all right all right
[1900.50 → 1902.62] still not enough to get me to buy a new
[1902.62 → 1905.48] phone uh, but then the other one is as
[1905.48 → 1907.66] nippleless cage uh pointed out do you
[1907.66 → 1909.98] really want to like to hand a cop your
[1909.98 → 1913.40] unlocked phone with your ID on it, I think
[1913.40 → 1915.72] that could be solved I think you could
[1915.72 → 1917.98] just see it on a lock screen yeah I still
[1917.98 → 1919.46] don't want to hand them my phone at all I
[1920.12 → 1922.46] guess here's this thing that is exactly as
[1922.46 → 1924.88] as much information as you need and
[1924.88 → 1926.80] nothing more thank you I think that's
[1926.80 → 1928.80] solvable I think having it on
[1928.80 → 1931.30] the lock screen solves it to me but I
[1931.30 → 1933.90] mean I understand the perspective they
[1933.90 → 1936.12] go away with it though, but I would love
[1936.12 → 1938.46] to have it as an option it's I feel like
[1938.46 → 1939.96] the same thing to me when you're in the
[1939.96 → 1941.14] States and you got to pay for something
[1941.14 → 1942.66] at a restaurant, and they take your card
[1942.66 → 1944.26] walk away, and I'm like what are you doing
[1944.26 → 1946.32] in Canada that's not normal they don't
[1946.32 → 1948.16] use it people don't take your credit
[1948.16 → 1950.04] card out of your site you actually hold
[1950.04 → 1952.16] it the whole time, and they give you the
[1952.16 → 1953.58] payment terminal at least in Western
[1953.58 → 1954.96] Canada I can't speak to the entire
[1954.96 → 1956.20] country maybe there are other norms
[1956.20 → 1958.34] elsewhere but the fact that in the
[1958.34 → 1960.24] States they still like take it away to
[1960.24 → 1962.28] put in their machine is pretty wild to us
[1962.28 → 1965.94] yeah but yeah no dude like I don't
[1965.94 → 1968.76] know man I would get rid of a wallet
[1968.76 → 1975.28] so fast and almost everything in my
[1975.28 → 1978.56] wallet I could replace digitally except my
[1978.56 → 1982.90] stupid driver stupid license, so I
[1982.90 → 1984.64] still have to carry around a car shape
[1984.64 → 1986.24] thing or a card shape thing no matter
[1986.24 → 1989.02] what G Freak says I disagree about the
[1989.02 → 1990.28] phone as a key the experience is
[1990.28 → 1993.28] objectively worse than a fob Tesla also
[1993.28 → 1997.96] has cards so like for me the issue with
[1997.96 → 2000.06] the fob is just that it's so bulky I
[2000.06 → 2001.52] wouldn't even care if they were compact
[2001.52 → 2006.00] which they totally could be like your
[2006.00 → 2008.48] your fob is bulky not all fobs are
[2008.48 → 2011.16] bulky and like the ones that the ones
[2011.16 → 2012.74] that you just your fob you just
[2012.74 → 2015.00] need to people have to know when you put
[2015.00 → 2016.72] it on the table you have to be able to
[2016.72 → 2019.08] roll up somewhere and be like my car is
[2019.08 → 2019.68] better than yours
[2019.68 → 2026.74] he's referencing something okay so fine I'll
[2026.74 → 2029.20] just tell the story I was so upset
[2029.20 → 2031.32] when I first got my car about how
[2031.32 → 2033.82] gigantic the key was and how big it
[2033.82 → 2035.58] makes my keychain because I have to
[2035.58 → 2037.80] carry fobs for multiple vehicles because
[2037.80 → 2041.06] I cannot be trusted to know which
[2041.06 → 2043.48] vehicle I'm going to take and like grab the
[2043.48 → 2045.52] key from somewhere that is not right next
[2045.52 → 2047.18] to the garage because that's terrible
[2047.18 → 2049.94] because of being able to intercept the
[2049.94 → 2051.38] whatever something steal your
[2051.38 → 2054.32] car anyway the point is that I keep all
[2054.32 → 2057.14] the fobs on my keys at all times because
[2057.14 → 2061.08] ADHD brain, and it made my keys my
[2061.08 → 2062.58] keychain like super bulky because they
[2062.58 → 2064.02] like are against each other and they
[2064.02 → 2068.50] like they spread out, and so I was
[2068.50 → 2070.54] googling around I was like okay can I get
[2070.54 → 2072.52] a third-party replacement for it like
[2072.52 → 2074.76] this thing is, and the answer is the
[2074.76 → 2077.24] answer is no at least not in any official
[2077.24 → 2080.10] capacity and so then the next thing I was
[2080.10 → 2082.16] looking up is like is there any kind of
[2082.16 → 2083.96] workaround like has someone done the
[2083.96 → 2087.98] equivalent of the like handheld we mod for
[2087.98 → 2090.84] for the Tynan fob you know like
[2090.84 → 2093.16] cut it down you know shave it down
[2093.16 → 2094.86] here shave it down there replace the
[2094.86 → 2096.60] buttons here 3d printer housing to make
[2096.60 → 2098.96] it is smaller the answer is no at least back
[2098.96 → 2100.84] when I looked it up and then the last
[2100.84 → 2103.72] thing I looked up was you know the thing
[2103.72 → 2105.36] that I look up when I'm just frustrated
[2105.36 → 2107.14] about something that I have absolutely no
[2107.14 → 2109.66] way to solve, and I just want someone to
[2109.66 → 2111.82] commiserate with me and I looked up is
[2111.82 → 2114.58] anyone else bothered by the giant stupid
[2114.58 → 2117.78] Porsche fob and I came across this thread
[2117.78 → 2121.44] on the stupid Porsche owners forum that
[2121.44 → 2124.22] is discussing the size of the fob and
[2124.22 → 2128.92] almost to a person people love it with
[2128.92 → 2132.42] this one guy who I just want to punch
[2132.42 → 2136.60] who whose post is like man I love the
[2136.60 → 2139.76] size because I just I love you know
[2139.76 → 2141.68] sitting down at the bar and putting my
[2141.68 → 2143.38] keys down and having it be more
[2143.38 → 2146.20] noticeable, and I'm like to you can feel
[2146.20 → 2148.14] like that or whatever like you can be a
[2148.14 → 2150.84] douchebag in your head but imagine
[2150.84 → 2154.20] imagine saying it out loud imagine
[2154.20 → 2156.46] articulating that thought I know you have
[2156.46 → 2159.00] the anonymous anonymity of the internet
[2159.00 → 2162.48] to hide behind here but holy shit really
[2162.48 → 2167.52] buddy like oh man I just I can't, I can't
[2167.52 → 2170.02] stand you we have nothing in common
[2170.02 → 2173.32] okay we own the same donkey stupid car
[2173.32 → 2175.06] but other than that, and you have an
[2175.06 → 2180.18] enormous key you have a huge and a tiny
[2180.18 → 2180.90] penis
[2180.90 → 2186.10] it's throbbing with energy so the
[2186.10 → 2188.38] extremely energetic key electric too
[2188.38 → 2193.62] yeah, yeah just oh I hate it so much
[2193.62 → 2195.10] anyway we're supposed to be talking
[2195.10 → 2197.56] about Apple the key is just ready and
[2197.56 → 2199.66] wriggling so you can now keep IDs in
[2199.66 → 2200.90] your Apple Wallet in certain states
[2200.90 → 2204.14] which is super cool I can see it in
[2204.14 → 2207.20] your pocket from over here are you just
[2207.20 → 2208.98] happy to see me or do you want a Porsche
[2208.98 → 2214.90] hey at least he wraps one of them
[2214.90 → 2220.84] charge me for life-size we should make a
[2220.84 → 2224.98] pocket on our pants oh my god we totally
[2224.98 → 2227.68] should we'll call them the e-peen sports
[2227.68 → 2229.36] gamer pants or something like that it
[2229.36 → 2231.28] could be sweatpants so it could be like a
[2231.28 → 2233.80] really baggy pocket like a huge pocket
[2233.80 → 2239.96] oh my goodness oh man um iPadOS wow
[2239.96 → 2243.00] Apple refuses to put touch screens on the
[2243.00 → 2246.72] Mac um for reasons I guess and refuses to
[2246.72 → 2249.40] make macOS touch friendly, but boy are they
[2249.40 → 2250.78] ever moving in the direction of making
[2250.78 → 2253.82] iPadOS like being a computer friendly
[2253.82 → 2256.60] actually good window management for app
[2256.60 → 2258.92] multitasking actually good background
[2258.92 → 2260.52] app support actually good audio
[2260.52 → 2261.94] management and actually good file
[2261.94 → 2265.06] management cool dang sweet I think I'm
[2265.06 → 2266.32] going to have to do a new switch to Apple
[2266.32 → 2267.64] challenge but this time not a MacBook
[2267.64 → 2270.22] tablets this time an iPad do you use
[2270.22 → 2272.18] tablets at all no, but I'll use it as my
[2272.18 → 2272.68] computer oh you're going to try to like
[2272.68 → 2275.40] mainline yeah interesting why not dude
[2275.40 → 2278.22] as window management iPad pros are like
[2278.22 → 2281.92] pretty crazy kind of sick and the price
[2281.92 → 2284.16] is good I've even like seen one but the
[2284.16 → 2286.04] last time some somebody told me they
[2286.04 → 2287.26] bought an iPad Pro, and I was like oh
[2287.26 → 2288.68] neat, and they told me the price and I
[2288.68 → 2291.02] almost fainted, and then they showed me
[2291.02 → 2292.84] like the reasons why it was worth it to
[2292.84 → 2296.56] them and as a person who drew art I was
[2296.56 → 2301.38] like yeah this is amazing I get it yeah it's
[2301.38 → 2306.64] expensive, but I get it yep iPad is it
[2306.64 → 2309.26] frankly it doesn't have competition I know
[2309.26 → 2311.20] there are other tablets, but I do agree
[2311.20 → 2313.02] anytime anyone asks me for a tablet
[2313.02 → 2314.50] recommendation I'm just like why haven't
[2314.50 → 2316.56] you bought an iPad already it's its just
[2316.56 → 2321.58] obvious yeah macOS Tahoe sorry 26
[2321.58 → 2323.08] everything has 26 at the end I actually
[2323.08 → 2323.96] really like that
[2323.96 → 2328.04] oh or Tahoe probably okay phone app
[2328.04 → 2330.24] you can make calls and voicemail from your
[2330.24 → 2332.32] Mac live activities stuff you're doing on
[2332.32 → 2333.64] your phone will appear on your Mac you can
[2333.64 → 2335.10] click the notification to open a mirrored
[2335.10 → 2337.10] iPhone screen the iPhone screen mirroring is
[2337.10 → 2339.76] actually super, super cool there's some
[2339.76 → 2341.64] spotlight upgrades which is great because oh
[2341.64 → 2343.10] this is actually in the notes it's been
[2343.10 → 2345.18] neglected for a while yes spotlight used
[2345.18 → 2348.00] to absolutely embarrass Windows search and
[2348.00 → 2349.74] now it still does but only because Windows
[2349.74 → 2352.88] search is embarrassing spotlights not that
[2352.88 → 2354.82] great the last time that I used a Mac
[2354.82 → 2357.98] regularly and Apple's now Shellacking a
[2357.98 → 2359.58] bunch of search alternatives and making it
[2359.58 → 2362.76] better this is cool so this from our video
[2362.76 → 2364.76] the demo they showed where buddy grabbed
[2364.76 → 2366.24] an image through spotlight put it directly
[2366.24 → 2368.14] into a document use spotlight to erase the
[2368.14 → 2369.30] background and keep it transparent and then
[2369.30 → 2371.10] send that file to another commonly used app
[2371.10 → 2372.72] all without going anywhere else except for the
[2372.72 → 2375.06] handy little search bar whoa very cool
[2375.06 → 2379.54] vision OS oh my god who cares and that was
[2379.54 → 2381.48] far from an exhaustive list, but I'd love to
[2381.48 → 2383.30] hear from you guys like hit us up in the
[2383.30 → 2386.38] float plane chat what was the thing that you
[2386.38 → 2390.84] are most excited about right not to
[2390.84 → 2392.48] tilt the flow plane chat but for me, it's
[2392.48 → 2396.54] easily the calling features and arrow or
[2396.54 → 2398.32] whatever they're calling glass yeah yeah
[2398.32 → 2401.16] bringing back sick transparent
[2401.16 → 2404.38] interfaces dude it feels so cool again yeah
[2404.38 → 2410.20] yeah yeah, and it doesn't have to be it
[2410.20 → 2412.82] doesn't have to be innovative like it doesn't
[2412.82 → 2414.40] even necessarily yeah it doesn't have they
[2414.40 → 2416.26] don't have to be the first one not everything
[2416.26 → 2418.38] needs to be the original Xbox UI
[2418.38 → 2424.98] do you need a tissue yeah you threw them
[2424.98 → 2426.98] over here for me already yeah yeah
[2426.98 → 2431.22] yeah I don't know where did that go so
[2431.22 → 2436.22] wrong I'm I'm going for I'm going for
[2436.22 → 2439.48] driver's license in the uh I'm in the
[2439.48 → 2441.66] digital wallet I that's pretty cool I'm
[2441.66 → 2443.48] super into it because it's just like I
[2443.48 → 2445.24] there's already third-party apps that I
[2445.24 → 2446.98] can put like my Costco card in and stuff
[2446.98 → 2450.06] like that, so the stupid driver's license is
[2450.06 → 2451.62] the only reason I still have to carry a
[2451.62 → 2453.28] wallet I also like if I'm like checking
[2453.28 → 2456.16] into a hotel, and they don't need my
[2456.16 → 2459.28] password um I will just hand over my
[2459.28 → 2463.06] license before they asked for my last name
[2463.06 → 2466.32] spelling yeah and I don't want to just
[2466.32 → 2467.72] give them my phone I don't know I would
[2467.72 → 2470.40] still definitely carry but what I might
[2470.40 → 2472.02] end up doing at that point is carrying it
[2472.02 → 2474.82] like behind my phone case or something
[2474.82 → 2477.50] sure so I have the option but if I'm not
[2477.50 → 2479.20] carrying any other cards then who cares
[2479.20 → 2484.48] is it in HD based as heck bring that back
[2484.48 → 2488.10] yeah oh apparently the Costco app has your
[2488.10 → 2491.88] card in it um I did not know that I do
[2491.88 → 2494.54] that makes sense I do not install apps
[2494.54 → 2499.12] any more I'm like kind of anti-app so is
[2499.12 → 2502.42] Wendell I really yeah Wendell from level
[2502.42 → 2503.98] one text in case you're wondering means
[2503.98 → 2506.58] that's based I mean I don't know about
[2506.58 → 2509.52] that, but my app fatigue does my app fatigue
[2509.52 → 2513.26] hit me a very, very long time ago and if I is
[2513.26 → 2516.52] there is not an absolutely necessary reason
[2516.52 → 2518.56] that I have to have your app like you can't
[2518.56 → 2520.04] do Disneyland without the app anymore
[2520.04 → 2523.16] frankly it's like impossible to have a
[2523.16 → 2524.54] reasonably good experience unless you
[2524.54 → 2527.30] have the app I don't install corporate
[2527.30 → 2530.08] apps I just won't and then as soon as we
[2530.08 → 2532.88] flew back I deleted the app because oh
[2532.88 → 2534.50] yeah is it gonna what is it why do I want
[2534.50 → 2536.06] it on my phone I can't think of a single
[2536.06 → 2537.88] good reason to have it on my phone yeah
[2537.88 → 2540.16] by the way there were a couple comments
[2540.16 → 2542.00] on the Disneyland vlog video that went up
[2542.00 → 2544.12] on LMG clips sort of questioning why we
[2544.12 → 2546.08] would go to Disneyland during present time
[2546.08 → 2548.04] we went to Disneyland a long time ago and
[2548.04 → 2550.82] you're just getting the video publicly
[2550.82 → 2553.54] now, and then we booked it a long
[2553.54 → 2555.96] time ago that's the bigger part we in a
[2555.96 → 2557.76] galaxy far away this stuff started
[2557.76 → 2565.14] happening like smugglers run right it was
[2565.14 → 2567.30] like right before we went stuff started
[2567.30 → 2569.38] happening so it was like it's all booked
[2569.38 → 2570.52] we have all our flights and everything
[2570.52 → 2572.26] like it's not it's not time to change it
[2572.26 → 2573.96] now oh shoot I was thinking of galaxy's
[2573.96 → 2575.46] edge actually that one was the cool one
[2575.46 → 2577.52] that was new that we really liked smugglers
[2577.52 → 2579.74] runs okay I misinterpreted that then yeah
[2579.74 → 2582.02] galaxy's edge the one with the giant set
[2582.02 → 2583.98] pieces right oh dude yeah that was galaxy's
[2583.98 → 2586.58] incredible I got a feature that I really
[2586.58 → 2588.22] like on my phone that might also be a
[2588.22 → 2590.22] thing on iPhone I don't know, but I get
[2590.22 → 2592.08] photo memories every once in a while I
[2592.08 → 2594.38] actually really like it and I very
[2594.38 → 2596.28] recently got ones from the Disneyland trip
[2596.28 → 2599.22] from that ride which I technically did
[2599.22 → 2601.30] twice right at the end of the
[2601.30 → 2603.14] Disneyland trip I somehow met up with
[2603.14 → 2605.46] Sean Caldera and Nick light, and we like
[2605.46 → 2607.72] somehow it's almost like they were there
[2607.72 → 2608.60] like it was
[2608.60 → 2611.48] and we sprinted
[2611.48 → 2613.98] I don't know how it happened you're you're at Disneyland
[2613.98 → 2615.28] I'm at Disneyland
[2615.28 → 2620.36] but we uh if I remember correctly neither of
[2620.36 → 2622.08] them had done the Star Wars area yet so
[2622.08 → 2624.18] despite me having done it I loved it so
[2624.18 → 2625.92] we sprinted back over, and then we were
[2625.92 → 2629.26] able to do everything there in like a
[2629.26 → 2631.92] tiny amount of time because we did
[2631.92 → 2633.96] smugglers run first and there wasn't
[2633.96 → 2635.34] really a line for it because fireworks
[2635.34 → 2637.82] were going off right but then galaxy's
[2637.82 → 2641.28] edge or whatever that rides called um it
[2641.28 → 2643.42] was broken because it's always broken but
[2643.42 → 2646.32] we heard that it became unbroken like the
[2646.32 → 2647.88] second we came out of smugglers run so
[2647.88 → 2650.36] we just flat out sprinted the whole way and
[2650.36 → 2652.24] got there with no line and got straight in
[2652.24 → 2656.10] amazing I always love like hacking
[2656.10 → 2658.38] hacking amusement parks for better efficiency
[2658.38 → 2662.02] I sent Luke a video of um my son wanted
[2662.02 → 2665.80] to watch the fireworks and also squeeze in
[2665.80 → 2668.44] one more run at Splash Mountain um and
[2668.44 → 2671.00] so I came up with a system where we
[2671.00 → 2674.34] could do both uh so he would walk he was
[2674.34 → 2676.94] walking backwards, and then I was like
[2676.94 → 2679.78] guiding him uh so that we could make good
[2679.78 → 2681.80] time over to Splash Mountain so he could
[2681.80 → 2683.60] watch the fireworks while we were actually
[2683.60 → 2685.88] moving at a pretty good clip it was actually
[2685.88 → 2689.52] awesome that was a really fun trip oh yeah
[2689.52 → 2690.40] it was great time
[2690.40 → 2695.56] um what happened okay yeah I don't I don't
[2695.56 → 2698.12] think I have too much else to yeah I think
[2698.12 → 2701.50] that's roughly it was a good event and
[2701.50 → 2703.86] honestly they announced a lot of things
[2703.86 → 2706.36] that you know it might still be an
[2706.36 → 2707.98] insurmountable barrier I'm not sure but
[2707.98 → 2709.26] they announced a lot of things that
[2709.26 → 2712.04] reduced my barrier from going to Apple
[2712.04 → 2714.54] stuff I will say the call features yep
[2714.54 → 2717.30] though those are like I've said multiple
[2717.30 → 2719.62] times non-negotiables, so now those are
[2719.62 → 2722.14] there so it's like okay I still don't
[2722.14 → 2725.28] think I would go, but it's becoming more
[2725.28 → 2725.70] interesting
[2725.70 → 2732.76] okay what are we talking about now should
[2732.76 → 2735.20] we talk about uh Mario Kart World and the
[2735.20 → 2737.04] Switch I don't think we should all right
[2737.04 → 2739.50] no let's yeah let's talk about it okay
[2739.50 → 2741.32] did we talk about Mario Kart World last
[2741.32 → 2744.16] week I think we talked about I hadn't
[2744.16 → 2746.28] even opened my Switch yet okay we talked
[2746.28 → 2749.12] about how I thought it was boring but
[2749.12 → 2750.08] we didn't talk about Mario Kart World's
[2750.66 → 2753.02] experience of owning it he watched me
[2753.02 → 2756.06] review our review so that's that's what I
[2756.06 → 2758.08] was doing before the show started I was I
[2758.08 → 2759.76] was watching our review of the Switch 2 it's
[2759.76 → 2763.32] going up tomorrow and there was one point
[2763.32 → 2766.40] where he was like mm-hmm which is when I
[2766.40 → 2768.14] gave my thoughts on Mario Kart World I
[2768.14 → 2770.12] didn't really elaborate during the
[2770.12 → 2773.78] Switch 2 review because I really felt
[2773.78 → 2776.54] like with a device like the Switch 2
[2776.54 → 2780.28] there's so much breadth for what you can
[2780.28 → 2783.04] talk about that you kind of have to pick
[2783.04 → 2784.84] a lane I think it didn't make a ton of
[2784.84 → 2786.28] sense to go super in-depth and market
[2786.28 → 2788.94] world and the lane that we picked was a
[2788.94 → 2791.04] PC guy's perspective sure which has kind
[2791.04 → 2793.44] of been our stick with Nintendo consoles
[2793.44 → 2795.54] for as long as I can remember us making
[2795.54 → 2798.00] videos about them yeah and so you know
[2798.00 → 2800.40] we talked about what we like about the
[2800.40 → 2803.10] hardware we talked about the comparisons
[2803.10 → 2804.96] you know PC guys we're all about you
[2804.96 → 2806.70] know what's the gen over gen improvement
[2806.70 → 2808.62] how does it compare to the other options
[2808.62 → 2810.24] that are out there we talk about a lot of
[2810.24 → 2812.28] that stuff you know what about the game
[2812.28 → 2814.00] marketplace you know we get into the
[2814.00 → 2816.66] stuff that you know as PC gamers either
[2816.66 → 2819.94] we take for granted or we know look at
[2819.94 → 2822.24] longingly like exclusive content or
[2822.24 → 2825.42] whatever right, so I just made the super
[2825.42 → 2829.52] offhand comment that is your Mario Kart
[2829.52 → 2833.48] world yeah maybe hot take not really
[2833.48 → 2838.52] enjoying it and okay why don't you why
[2838.52 → 2841.42] don't you go first, so I was an extreme
[2841.42 → 2843.94] enjoyer of Mario Kart 8, and I'm not
[2843.94 → 2845.58] actually even talking about Mario Kart 8
[2845.58 → 2848.84] deluxe which is the same thing but on
[2848.84 → 2850.44] switch I'm talking about Mario Kart 8 on
[2850.44 → 2853.94] Wii U I played the heck out of it
[2853.94 → 2856.68] fantastic game liked it a ton literally
[2856.68 → 2859.44] got to the point where he was so sweaty
[2859.44 → 2862.18] at it that he had to play not during
[2862.18 → 2864.66] North American evening he had to line up
[2864.66 → 2866.88] his playtime with like Japan when
[2866.88 → 2868.40] Japanese players were online like the
[2868.40 → 2871.12] only ranked match I could find you're
[2871.12 → 2873.02] an actual was sick it was so much you
[2873.02 → 2875.58] are an actual really enjoyed that era I
[2875.58 → 2877.68] had specific songs I would listen to
[2877.68 → 2880.22] because they were just in my playlist at
[2880.22 → 2881.82] the time, and it has turned out that like
[2881.82 → 2884.20] even years later if those songs come on
[2884.20 → 2886.50] my brain's just like Mario it's Mario
[2886.50 → 2887.98] Kart time watch out for the blue show
[2887.98 → 2892.82] yeah yeah and like yeah it was fun but
[2892.82 → 2895.96] you know then I didn't play for many
[2895.96 → 2898.14] many years Mario Kart world gets announced
[2898.14 → 2899.52] and I'm like oh man it could be fun to
[2899.52 → 2901.40] like get into a Mario Kart game again all
[2901.40 → 2904.98] the kind of stuff I played it for probably
[2904.98 → 2907.54] like a couple of hours and then was like I'm
[2907.54 → 2909.06] going to take a break and go to other stuff
[2909.06 → 2911.32] and then I don't think I picked it back
[2911.32 → 2913.38] up again I ended up putting a different
[2913.38 → 2915.30] game in my switch and playing that I think
[2915.30 → 2917.56] I might have fundamentally not understood
[2917.56 → 2920.06] what the game was when I got excited
[2920.06 → 2923.34] about it, so I have never played a Sforza
[2923.34 → 2928.00] Horizon game, so I didn't really like when
[2928.00 → 2930.02] people were comparing it to that or even
[2930.02 → 2931.58] if they're comparing it to it now or not
[2931.58 → 2933.84] comparing it to it, I don't really know I
[2933.84 → 2935.36] saw people kind of making those
[2935.36 → 2937.02] comparisons, and I was like okay that's
[2937.02 → 2938.66] interesting, but it didn't really mean much
[2938.66 → 2941.60] to me but what I did pick up on is that
[2941.60 → 2944.30] it's open world and there's like
[2944.30 → 2947.24] stuff to do and my assumption was that
[2947.24 → 2951.04] there would be some kind of like thread
[2951.04 → 2955.06] to follow through this world maybe like
[2955.06 → 2957.48] Breath of the Wild is open world right
[2957.48 → 2959.22] but there's a story there's a guy and
[2959.22 → 2961.68] there's like stuff that you might want to
[2961.68 → 2965.86] do and so my immediate confusion when I
[2965.86 → 2970.04] before I had even done a race yet was I got to
[2970.04 → 2973.34] the title menu, and I was like where's the
[2973.34 → 2977.86] campaign was kind of I was like because and
[2977.86 → 2981.70] that's not okay be fair to me okay that is not
[2981.70 → 2985.30] a completely out there assumption I mean
[2985.30 → 2988.30] Smash Bros Brawl had a campaign it's a
[2988.30 → 2990.88] pretty weak campaign you just move around on a
[2990.88 → 2993.32] world map and unlock characters you just it's a
[2993.32 → 2996.08] fighting game campaign yeah but for crying out loud it
[2996.08 → 2999.46] had one there was something Mario Kart 8 didn't have a campaign either
[2999.46 → 3002.78] fair enough, but I mean it's an open world Mario Kart game was it
[3002.78 → 3006.96] maybe expect something was it completely crazy of me to think okay there's some
[3006.96 → 3010.80] kind of like campaign or something usually they're like the like campaign I
[3010.80 → 3014.44] understand this is not equivalent at all but the campaign Mario Kart games is
[3014.44 → 3017.80] usually you know getting first and all the different modes and all the
[3017.80 → 3023.84] different things and then unlocking all the stuff so, so anyway I and then I
[3023.84 → 3030.96] was like okay but hold on a second like open world get where what Grand Prix
[3030.96 → 3038.84] knockout yeah, yeah knockout like online yeah yeah where even is that where even
[3038.84 → 3042.78] is the open world it's, and it's like buried in one of the like sub menus
[3042.78 → 3048.10] at the bottom and that was my hint that this might just be you care about that so
[3048.10 → 3052.22] much this might just be racing marketing kind of ran with that a little bit too
[3052.22 → 3056.46] hard now here's what here's what I will say here's what I will say from a purely
[3056.46 → 3064.32] on the surface from a race just gameplay perspective I actually love the
[3064.32 → 3068.40] direction they've taken the maps wait I will get there wait I will get there and
[3068.40 → 3073.98] I start tracks excuse me oh terrible I actually love the direction they've taken
[3073.98 → 3081.24] the tracks I found the Mario Kart 8 tracks a little bit to effect everywhere I
[3081.24 → 3086.40] can't even tell which of these upcoming surfaces is even the one I'm supposed to
[3086.40 → 3090.78] be driving on because we're going to go this way, and now we're like upside down
[3090.78 → 3096.00] and I found it extremely disorienting as someone who doesn't know life the game
[3096.00 → 3100.02] yeah, but that's fair to even know what direction to go
[3100.02 → 3105.72] whereas those like magnetic wheel things which I did not love I enjoyed, but I can
[3105.72 → 3110.14] see how that would be annoying Mario Kart world is very gravity goes this way
[3110.14 → 3114.30] for the most part there are still areas that I think you could find kind of
[3114.30 → 3119.18] confusing like some of the transitions you turn into a wave rider and some of
[3119.18 → 3122.82] the transitions between land and water you go in the water, and it's like okay
[3122.82 → 3129.08] that actually is like kind of stupid yeah but in general I like the direction
[3129.08 → 3135.52] they've gone, and so I would probably still buy it just to have it on my TV when
[3135.52 → 3142.68] people come over, but that's a thing but a game that I'm just going to like sit and play I don't feel a sense of
[3142.68 → 3147.24] accomplishment that matters to me from finding a white version of Joshi by doing
[3147.24 → 3151.42] challenges in the open world thing like I did I went, and I like you can also do
[3151.42 → 3156.60] that not open world yeah I got a hamburger yeah or something like you can do it on
[3156.60 → 3159.90] normal tracks to normal races yeah it doesn't really incentivize well maybe
[3159.90 → 3163.14] there's probably certain things that have to be some people are super into it
[3163.14 → 3167.40] and like that's fine but like cosmetics have never been super meaningful to me, so I
[3167.40 → 3172.50] didn't I just didn't really like care about it and so I just kind of I did
[3172.50 → 3179.10] like three of the Grand Prix's I three starred two of them at 150 CC and then to
[3179.10 → 3183.12] start another one I've been told that apparently it's hard Elijah's like having
[3183.12 → 3192.66] trouble with it or something yeah so before my meal arrived at IHOP I
[3192.66 → 3198.54] had I had gold trophied two Grand Prix's yeah at 150 CC, and I was like this is like
[3198.54 → 3204.06] it oh man I was just honestly I didn't even do any Grand Prix's I was
[3204.06 → 3209.34] doing knockout and I think I first placed like half the maps or something um I
[3209.34 → 3212.68] haven't even tried okay people are saying it's just a skill issue for Elijah so
[3212.68 → 3220.36] maybe that's okay maybe that's something yeah, but anyway he tries after a
[3220.36 → 3226.92] little while I was like I was like okay what now I could go online but
[3226.92 → 3230.62] realistically I'm not going to know life this game enough to be competitive
[3230.62 → 3239.78] online, and it's just I don't care and especially I don't care because
[3239.78 → 3248.60] of this comment that oh man who left it um shoot can I even I accidentally
[3248.60 → 3252.20] scrolled and I don't remember exactly what they said but one of the first
[3252.20 → 3257.82] things yeah here it is from Pathos is Mario Kart world is so good the skill
[3257.82 → 3263.02] ceiling is so high now with the wall riding the rail grinding and the item
[3263.02 → 3269.68] aiming and that's actually the reason that I probably don't think I could ever
[3269.68 → 3275.68] get into it because I feel like it has become the kind of game that unless that
[3275.68 → 3281.78] you would be better off watching 10 hours of YouTube videos then playing 10 hours
[3281.78 → 3288.96] of the game if you wanted to get better, and I'm just not into it, it's very meta heavy
[3288.96 → 3295.86] like people are already like shaving minutes off of times, and it's like
[3295.86 → 3308.76] when I was when I was going hyper sweat with on Wii U with Mario Kart 8 um I was I would just like
[3308.76 → 3313.30] practice I would do you know you just play ranked matches online, and you'll see what other people
[3313.30 → 3316.90] sometimes do you don't notice like oh that line's perfect or oh I didn't actually notice that
[3316.90 → 3321.14] shortcut before or whatever you just kind of grow and if you got really, really sweaty you
[3321.14 → 3326.68] could do time trials and go against the person who has number one and try to like to follow them
[3326.68 → 3330.42] and figure that stuff out time trials don't always transfer to real races because there are no items
[3330.42 → 3334.44] and all that other kind of stuff there are certain risks you don't want to take if there could be a
[3334.44 → 3340.40] blue shell or a red shell or something coming um, but it was like playing the game is how I got
[3340.40 → 3346.28] better at the game so cool I also don't want to sit and watch 10 hours of YouTube videos to get better
[3346.28 → 3353.16] um wall riding for me just completely broke it um I didn't actually I didn't look into the game
[3353.16 → 3355.98] a ton before I bought my switch because I was like it's Mario Kart I'm going to get Mario Kart anyway
[3355.98 → 3361.90] um, and I'm still happy that I have it for the party game aspect like you were talking um and I just
[3361.90 → 3366.84] hope that whenever there's party games people don't grind Mario Kart because anybody who does
[3366.84 → 3372.44] wall riding at all will completely break the experience for everyone yeah and that that's why like the
[3372.44 → 3378.12] the second I saw wall riding was in, and I was like okay maybe it just makes it so that like if you
[3378.12 → 3382.14] write up on a bank or something it's not as bad, and then I noticed how it works, and I was like
[3382.14 → 3390.26] game over so basically my issue it's done my issue with Mario Kart 8 is like on the surface gone
[3390.26 → 3396.98] because it's very clear which way gravity goes which addresses that but once we get a little bit
[3396.98 → 3403.64] deeper it's actually amplified like 10x because now because my issue is that it's not obvious
[3403.64 → 3409.58] where you're supposed to drive and so to me so to the people who want it like it's the same reason
[3409.58 → 3415.56] that I just I Luke and I played I think like half a dozen rounds of deadlock I think it was and we
[3415.56 → 3421.40] were just like we didn't get in at the very beginning so we got dumped into a closed beta at a time
[3421.40 → 3428.64] when people had been no life in it for months, and it was just not even a little bit fun until you've
[3428.64 → 3436.02] like watched countless hours of tutorials and know all the right meta, and you know what I'll be the
[3436.02 → 3441.70] first to admit that getting super into a game like that can be extremely rewarding and extremely
[3441.70 → 3447.30] entertaining Supreme Commander would be an example of a game that I know life enough and was complex
[3447.30 → 3454.02] enough that I would say it is comparable to either of those games you have no you have no equivalent
[3454.02 → 3464.34] units across up to four different races in an RTS and the maps are so diverse where they'll reward
[3464.34 → 3471.78] ground land or sea or in particular they will reward first one then the other as you progress through
[3471.78 → 3479.40] the tech trees of all three of them like it is extremely, extremely deep in terms of its gameplay
[3479.40 → 3487.64] I get if it's a lot of fun but for me that's not Mario Kart well there's also that's not the role Mario
[3487.64 → 3493.20] Kart serves in my life yeah there 's's one of the comments I think I might have lost it
[3493.20 → 3498.14] because they didn't tag me yeah so I don't know where I went, but somebody was like wall riding is
[3498.14 → 3504.12] slower um wall riding in a lot of places where they clearly intentionally wanted you to wall ride
[3504.12 → 3510.74] is slower wall riding when you break the map by doing crazy shortcuts and stuff is not slower that's
[3510.74 → 3515.78] the part that I'm complaining about another thing that I'm complaining about is I liked Mario Kart 8's
[3516.62 → 3521.18] um I honestly I played very little of deluxe, but I'm pretty sure it was just the same game ported to
[3521.18 → 3526.72] switch, so I don't know uh it's probably the same deal but um I liked Mario Kart 8's drifting
[3526.72 → 3531.96] so much that it got me like interested in drifting, and I watched initial d and like learned how drifting
[3531.96 → 3538.54] worked oh that's funny I actually hated it and ate, and I love it in world oh because it sucks in world
[3538.54 → 3544.96] is that why it's because I only ever played Mario Kart DS like a lot like I probably have a couple
[3544.96 → 3552.44] hundred hours in Mario Kart DS that's the only one that I've ever played a ton and the drifting I
[3552.44 → 3559.30] I fired up Joshi I fired up the standard bike, and I was like f***in gripping it up, and I'm like
[3559.30 → 3566.64] this okay so they just ported it straight out of Mario Kart DS yeah uh so you know I guess it's just
[3566.64 → 3573.22] like a favourite game thing I think so Pathos also encapsulated another issue that I have which is
[3573.22 → 3579.14] like hold on Pathos has another one first uh Pathos uh, so this was the person who I highlighted
[3579.14 → 3585.48] earlier saying they loved it Pathos replied I can't even disagree I've watched 20 videos to learn how
[3585.48 → 3589.90] to get better already yeah, yeah okay sorry what were you going to say I said it's shortcuts glower with
[3589.90 → 3595.00] over 200 unique routes between all the different courses, so a practice player will just be unstoppable
[3595.00 → 3599.00] however I don't think most people will ever get there I know I wouldn't be able to memorize that
[3599.00 → 3606.04] many routes, but that's the problem that completely takes the fun out of it as a casual game yeah um
[3606.04 → 3609.94] and I remember having this conversation with Luke back when he was no living Mario Kart 8
[3609.94 → 3618.20] because I was like dude you f***ed up as a wanting to have fun at someone's house game I did ruin it
[3618.20 → 3626.52] yeah it was absolutely no fun to play Mario Kart with him yeah that sucks yep and when and when
[3626.52 → 3631.72] you're that good at a team game like if you're that good at Counter-Strike or something, and you can
[3631.72 → 3637.28] just you can just put like an equal superstar on the other team or whatever that's fine it's an
[3637.28 → 3642.76] individual game but when it's an individual game it's all about what Mario Kart is for you and if
[3642.76 → 3646.80] you want Mario Kart to be like a sweaty no life
[3646.80 → 3656.50] and I did optimization problem then that's you know what like that's cool all power to you, it's just
[3656.50 → 3663.00] I wish that wasn't what Mario Kart was to me as a kid and so as like an old man yells at cloud gamer
[3663.00 → 3668.94] uh I just I wish it was I wish it was more for me, but it isn't and that's okay, and I'm sure some
[3668.94 → 3676.74] people enjoy it I don't like that type of sweaty optimization I often do like sweaty optimization
[3676.74 → 3684.24] I just don't like that kind Braga says cough super checks uh actually Luke won our last one or the
[3684.24 → 3687.84] second last one I think it's I think it's been a long enough time I think we're pretty even again
[3687.84 → 3695.16] yeah I've I've degraded which is good yeah yeah it's good hey I got air hockey
[3695.16 → 3700.76] I yeah I heard I think it's not working it make it upstairs it no it's upstairs now, but it worked
[3700.76 → 3705.22] like for an afternoon and then is broken, so someone's coming to look at it arcade games man on the one
[3705.22 → 3710.34] hand they're like industrial grade on the other hand it seems like they break a lot just from my
[3710.34 → 3717.08] experience with them interesting what breaks on an air hockey table um the fan yeah that seems like
[3717.08 → 3722.02] something that shouldn't break that off yeah it really does Anthony says uh whoa why is live quality
[3722.02 → 3730.30] so much better on float plane I don't know but the rest of you all should try it float plane uh oh we're
[3730.30 → 3735.08] supposed to explain and to merch messages whatever that means merch messages are the way to
[3735.08 → 3739.34] interact with the show we believe that when you throw money at your screen you should get
[3739.34 → 3746.04] something in return and boy can you ever get some cool stuff on lttstore.com man there's been
[3746.04 → 3752.40] there's been a lot of reviews of LTT products lately aside from the shift one that um Yvonne
[3752.40 → 3758.78] flagged one for me uh what was her name oh shoot I've I've put it away but um there's the
[3758.78 → 3763.12] unnecessary inventions video yeah yeah we were highlighted by unnecessary inventions
[3763.12 → 3769.46] and then there was uh Linus versus sponsor I think was the title of it yeah here we go uh
[3769.46 → 3773.60] switch and click this is a couple of weeks ago, but I'm just seeing it now yeah I haven't seen this
[3773.60 → 3779.46] that's fascinating LTT commuter bag versus our own sponsor ridge uh their own commuter bag so
[3779.46 → 3784.86] I thought that was that was pretty cool um anyway there's lots of great stuff on lttstore.com
[3784.86 → 3789.46] including some new stuff this week and all you got to do to send a merch message if you want to
[3789.46 → 3795.18] yeah do that send a message to the show or get a message through to producer Dan who man that drip
[3795.18 → 3801.06] though anyway um is added something to the cart a little box will pop up you leave a merch message
[3801.06 → 3806.56] and it will go to producer Dan who will forward it or curate it, and we'll show you how that works
[3806.56 → 3813.00] Dan want to read us a curated merch message sure I've got one here from Jake evening DLL I purchased
[3813.00 → 3820.46] PSV fired up uh sorry psvr2 fired up beat safer then promptly smacked my hand against the desk
[3820.46 → 3826.52] I finished the song to find I had reopened a recent cut blood everywhere any absurd injuries
[3826.52 → 3832.44] I shouldn't necessarily have laughed at that but no that's hilarious no that's funny is it I'm sorry
[3832.44 → 3836.72] but that's funny that is pretty funny controllers are stained that's funny it's hilarious because
[3836.72 → 3842.40] they played through it, and they seem to be okay you don't know that, and then we're just like oh god
[3842.40 → 3847.62] that's amazing that's funny stuff it's good um I don't know if it's absurd, but it's certainly my
[3847.62 → 3855.54] most recent injury I was I had my brother my brother-in-law and my son, and I was like to we
[3855.54 → 3861.68] like we have these go-karts at my house that we don't really use that often because um Yvonne's not
[3861.68 → 3866.00] really that into them and so it's not something that we just like we'll go out and do as a family
[3866.00 → 3873.02] so I was like hey, hey boys should we hit the go-karts, and so we're we're all we're gearing up
[3873.02 → 3876.52] we're all putting on helmets and everything and I realized that my son and his friends took the stupid
[3876.52 → 3882.76] things out, and they plugged the chargers into the backs of all the carts, but one of the wall warts was
[3882.76 → 3887.72] not plugged into the wall so all of a sudden I didn't have a cart, and I was like oh man I went and
[3887.72 → 3892.52] invited too many people because I could have just only asked two of them I could have told I could
[3892.52 → 3897.64] have told my son that he has to like to stay home or whatever and hang out with his you know his niece
[3897.64 → 3904.54] uh cousin not my niece uh anyway the point is um I didn't have a vehicle all of a sudden I'm like oh
[3904.54 → 3913.58] crap, so I went, and I dug up my old um man who even made it ah San Francisco Special Z Board was that
[3913.58 → 3922.60] what they were called Z Board San Francisco Special uh yeah, yeah so I dug up my old Z Board
[3922.60 → 3929.02] this thing and uh you still have this yeah why not wouldn't you well it's from a decade ago yeah
[3929.02 → 3933.40] so I'm a little surprised dude take these shoes would you believe that these were on special
[3933.40 → 3936.62] let's go those are actually kind of sick right
[3936.62 → 3944.76] anyway uh, so I dug out my old Z Board, and I was like okay I'll try and keep up, but it's yeah it's
[3944.76 → 3952.96] old it's its a decade old and electric batteries and motors and stuff like have come a long way
[3952.96 → 3958.82] in 10 years that thing is not fast by modern standards, so I was trying really hard to keep up
[3958.82 → 3963.94] well which ended up being both a blessing and a curse um, so the bad part is I couldn't keep up
[3963.94 → 3969.34] so I was kind of taking hacky shortcuts to try to keep up with them as we were cruising
[3969.34 → 3978.56] but it ended up being a good thing because dude I bailed super hard um my brother-in-law looked back
[3978.56 → 3983.58] he said I apparently did like a full barrel roll in the air before hitting the ground I don't actually
[3983.58 → 3988.58] recall much of it all I recall is that I was trying to go around a speed bump so that I wouldn't have to
[3988.58 → 3995.64] slow down for it the way that they were and as I got to the edge I rode up the curb so it just
[3995.64 → 4003.28] dumped me, and I've got this I don't really normally bruise yeah, but I have this gorgeous oh yeah green
[4003.28 → 4008.26] yeah that's a good one um situation going on here on my elbow how much it's going to show up on camera
[4008.26 → 4013.34] but it won't show up on camera it's definitely there I don't bruise super, super hard for the most part
[4013.34 → 4020.44] um so that was really dumb um I'm sure I could come up with a hundred dumb ways that I've
[4020.44 → 4024.78] injured myself was it just ways we've injured ourselves or was it uh I thought it was
[4024.78 → 4028.06] gaming was it related to the VR thing or was it just ways we've injured ourselves
[4028.06 → 4034.20] I don't think I've ever just uh any recent absurd injuries okay this is not recent at all but
[4034.20 → 4041.70] probably not even recent my most absurd injury is definitely the hockey laces from uh nerd
[4041.70 → 4051.32] sports oh I thought I was going to have permanent scars from this we uh we were filming nerd sports back
[4051.32 → 4056.74] in the day, and we had to do ice hockey and I don't remember the exact issue I think the skates didn't
[4056.74 → 4061.90] really fit me properly or whatnot and I didn't skate very well, so my skates were kind of like buckling
[4061.90 → 4068.36] in, and it made it so that the laces on the outside of both of my ankles were cutting into my feet
[4068.36 → 4075.00] well my ankles the whole time, but I didn't want to stop the shoot because you know this is our one
[4075.00 → 4083.74] chance to do it um by the end of it I genuinely had cut like grooves into each one of my ankles and they
[4083.74 → 4092.48] were bleeding um and I had to that night I had to film a video after we did this hockey thing I had
[4092.48 → 4096.80] to go and film a networking video back in the office and then Brandon and I were going to I think it was
[4096.80 → 4103.72] Switzerland or something so I was on the plane with my ankles just bleeding, and I was like
[4103.72 → 4109.84] a country I'd never been to before going to like pharmacies trying to figure out like is there
[4109.84 → 4116.92] something I can get for these grooves there in my ankles and then there are a few videos like actually
[4116.92 → 4123.58] a few for quite a while where if you see my ankles ever you can see a line on the outside of them and I
[4123.58 → 4129.86] thought I was going to have permanent matching scars on my ankles for forever because they I that line
[4129.86 → 4137.14] lasted for like years I think and then uh they're gone now so which is weird because I've had much
[4137.14 → 4145.64] smaller cuts that ended up scarring, but those didn't I don't know um shoot sorry I'm trying
[4145.64 → 4152.26] very hard to find something it's not my absurd injury, but it's definitely an absurd injury, and it's um
[4152.26 → 4158.98] it's its kind of funny if oh my god skip I don't care about any of this not the leg press one right
[4158.98 → 4164.40] uh no way you'd show that no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no that's
[4164.40 → 4170.00] somebody that's gross falling over is it someone falling over what are you even talking about
[4170.00 → 4174.06] I think Dan's referencing it I thought you were just going to show Jay Fatsos like look at this injury
[4174.06 → 4182.12] here we go it's my wife what is this tech tip don't drop your phone on your face
[4182.12 → 4188.32] oh wow I got it on the security camera what
[4188.32 → 4200.06] we're raising it up too brutal let's make it worse she was readjusting it to reach something
[4200.06 → 4207.16] oh so it was like, and then the corner got dude it like cut her face open oh wow like I had
[4207.16 → 4213.70] to go get the um the like the adhesive like strips the flat adhesive strips that like hold it
[4213.70 → 4218.46] together it actually ended up not scarring much like I know where it is, and I can notice it but
[4218.46 → 4225.04] it's not it's not super noticeable, but she is like they're heavy like when that much weight hits
[4225.04 → 4234.02] you in one spot, and it's oh yeah like lined up it is will break skin yeah, and you're dude your face
[4234.02 → 4241.76] bleeds like a bitch it's crazy um it's totally a thing yeah bing search by the way was how I found it
[4241.76 → 4252.32] google I could not find this go bing search quality check this out so I searched for I tried
[4252.32 → 4260.58] Linus twitter phone drop face because I knew it was there somewhere uh one two three four yeah there
[4260.58 → 4266.46] you go like uh oh no not that one this one so it was like the sixth or seventh result it's pretty good
[4266.46 → 4271.24] that it got it at all yeah oh yeah google like I tried a few different combinations including this one
[4271.24 → 4277.84] couldn't find it at all yeah really hard to get it google search has just gotten so bad uh rice asks
[4277.84 → 4284.26] do you have a security camera just for the couch absolutely not we ain't doing no freak offs um
[4284.26 → 4293.40] and if we did is we did that's not how I would record them I'm not judging as long as everyone's
[4293.40 → 4298.64] consenting I'm just saying I'm not judging that's all I'm just saying that that's not why I have that
[4298.64 → 4303.54] camera that was just the living room camera and I it was punched in that's why the quality was so
[4303.54 → 4307.96] wait you have like proper camera cues or like what's why wouldn't you mean if
[4307.96 → 4312.62] you're going to record it do it right yeah I mean if it's gonna eventually do anything do it right if
[4312.62 → 4317.34] it's going to end eventually end up in a court of law it might as well look good cinematic
[4317.34 → 4319.88] flow plane x
[4319.88 → 4329.30] it's like that guy there's some guy who had a tape get leaked recently or part of it um
[4329.30 → 4335.84] and his response was basically like well don't release just part of it I like I last longer than
[4335.84 → 4341.88] that release the whole thing, and I was like wow that's uh seriously that is one way to respond to
[4341.88 → 4347.28] that it's like the opposite of the Streisand effect yeah it's like well now I don't want to watch it
[4347.28 → 4349.18] yeah, yeah pretty much you made it gross
[4349.18 → 4356.84] it's like ah all right dude all right next controversy sure yeah moving on yeah
[4356.84 → 4360.88] yeah somebody uh whoever that is I don't know

[4465.28 → 4467.92] dell will send us new lovely laptops by dell
[4467.92 → 4482.34] this is what I have to do too to
[4482.34 → 4484.02] okay get things wet
[4484.02 → 4487.70] there you go oh it's hard to see on camera
[4487.70 → 4488.60] oh so cool
[4488.60 → 4490.00] let's punch into Linus cam
[4490.00 → 4492.22] uh oh yeah that one works too
[4492.22 → 4492.94] we'll go to loot cam
[4492.94 → 4493.94] oh my god
[4493.94 → 4496.44] it's not easy to see from the camera
[4496.44 → 4497.08] I'm working on it
[4497.08 → 4498.74] it's so easy to see in person
[4498.74 → 4500.86] oh no it's pretty good on camera too
[4500.86 → 4501.68] is it
[4501.68 → 4501.94] yeah
[4501.94 → 4504.68] oh well is it just like the compression or something
[4504.68 → 4506.54] okay yeah give us a bit more zoom there you go there you go
[4506.54 → 4508.12] okay you can really see it here
[4508.12 → 4508.62] oh it's so cool
[4508.62 → 4511.78] so it's um it's a multi-layer material
[4511.78 → 4515.26] and when it's wet the top one goes translucent
[4515.26 → 4517.96] so it's covered in little bread sources
[4517.96 → 4521.98] uh the camera is not doing a great job of picking up the contrast
[4521.98 → 4524.22] but it's very easy to see them in person
[4524.22 → 4524.66] yes
[4524.66 → 4526.34] um super cool
[4526.34 → 4529.34] anyway hold on I'm going to go back to the wide cam
[4529.34 → 4530.66] so the back which didn't get wet
[4530.66 → 4531.02] yeah
[4531.02 → 4532.00] it's still just plain blue
[4532.00 → 4534.08] and then here yeah I know you can't really
[4534.08 → 4534.62] it shows up on stream
[4534.62 → 4535.64] oh that's not bad
[4535.64 → 4536.58] it shows up on stream
[4536.58 → 4538.70] that camera just doesn't have very good contrast
[4538.70 → 4539.92] oh is it just this display
[4539.92 → 4540.84] yeah
[4540.84 → 4541.72] okay cool
[4541.72 → 4542.22] yeah
[4542.22 → 4543.14] that looks fine
[4543.14 → 4544.36] yeah so cool
[4544.36 → 4544.92] that's awesome
[4544.92 → 4546.32] oh wait wait wait wait
[4546.32 → 4547.24] hold on though
[4547.24 → 4550.02] uh we have to get the details of the product before people buy it though
[4550.02 → 4550.66] uh oh
[4550.66 → 4553.94] um I think there might be some details that they need
[4553.94 → 4554.98] yes
[4554.98 → 4558.00] okay, so the bread is a rare drop
[4558.00 → 4559.10] the bread
[4559.10 → 4561.08] the bread source is a rare drop
[4561.08 → 4561.66] oh
[4561.66 → 4564.16] you'll only know when it gets wet
[4564.16 → 4565.00] oh that's cool
[4565.00 → 4566.12] that's kind of fun
[4566.12 → 4567.16] so it's a circuit board
[4567.16 → 4570.90] circuit board I believe is the standard drop
[4570.90 → 4572.08] uh 80
[4572.08 → 4576.40] most will come with a circuit pattern with a 1 in 20 chance to receive the elusive
[4576.40 → 4577.96] bread-a-Taurus pattern
[4577.96 → 4578.54] correct
[4578.54 → 4581.86] uh, but they will all have the same cool
[4581.86 → 4582.32] this
[4582.32 → 4585.12] only reveals the pattern when wet
[4585.12 → 4586.92] this photo shoot is incredible
[4586.92 → 4589.08] oh yeah
[4589.08 → 4591.02] what the heck
[4591.02 → 4592.02] I uh
[4592.02 → 4594.70] I keep thinking it's just a green screen, but it's really not
[4594.70 → 4597.08] that is a real bread-Taurus by the way
[4597.08 → 4597.64] wow
[4597.64 → 4598.42] pool thing
[4598.42 → 4599.00] um
[4599.00 → 4599.34] AI
[4599.34 → 4600.38] fun fact
[4600.38 → 4601.46] uh fun fact
[4601.46 → 4602.20] no it's real
[4602.20 → 4602.54] fake
[4602.54 → 4606.34] we apparently spent a thousand dollars on it which I don't recall
[4606.34 → 4607.46] sounds a little low
[4607.46 → 4608.78] um
[4608.78 → 4609.92] it's not over your limit
[4609.92 → 4611.50] and it's impossible to ride
[4611.50 → 4612.84] I have tried
[4612.84 → 4615.30] that's what I hear too
[4615.30 → 4616.78] I jumped onto the top
[4616.78 → 4617.40] grabbed my
[4617.40 → 4618.90] grabbed my hands on here
[4618.90 → 4621.26] and then it immediately because of the high centre of gravity
[4621.26 → 4623.44] went face-first into the pool
[4623.44 → 4623.78] oh yeah
[4623.78 → 4625.42] so that's a thing that happened
[4625.42 → 4627.74] here's both patterns
[4627.74 → 4631.16] uh here's a nice little high quality silicone
[4631.16 → 4632.46] I like that by the way
[4632.46 → 4633.54] that's a fun
[4633.54 → 4634.32] that's a fun logo
[4634.32 → 4636.18] I think the team
[4636.18 → 4636.88] absolutely
[4636.88 → 4638.18] knocked it out of the park
[4638.18 → 4639.10] with this product
[4639.10 → 4639.58] uh
[4639.58 → 4640.58] very cool
[4640.58 → 4643.32] it's its everything that was good about our previous swim trunks
[4643.32 → 4644.10] but
[4644.10 → 4645.00] way better
[4645.00 → 4646.26] I really like the colour too
[4646.26 → 4648.52] um
[4648.52 → 4648.98] yeah
[4648.98 → 4649.98] yeah no me too
[4649.98 → 4650.66] me too
[4650.66 → 4651.74] I think they nailed it
[4651.74 → 4653.06] uh
[4653.06 → 4654.12] W Calderon says
[4654.12 → 4655.42] if I buy 20 pairs
[4655.42 → 4656.76] am I guaranteed brand
[4656.76 → 4658.14] technically no
[4658.14 → 4658.62] no
[4658.62 → 4661.56] I'm afraid that it doesn't work that way
[4661.56 → 4662.94] learn statistics
[4662.94 → 4665.06] um
[4665.06 → 4665.62] okay
[4665.62 → 4666.06] anyway
[4666.06 → 4667.52] that's not the only thing
[4667.52 → 4668.06] that we have
[4668.06 → 4669.04] so there's the three
[4669.04 → 4670.98] there's the three different products
[4670.98 → 4672.66] so the touch stand collection
[4672.66 → 4673.86] also includes
[4673.86 → 4674.96] the big
[4674.96 → 4675.66] hex
[4675.66 → 4676.50] beach towel
[4676.50 → 4678.28] it's big
[4678.28 → 4679.68] wait did you tell them about the draw cords
[4679.68 → 4681.28] oh no
[4681.28 → 4682.18] oh sorry
[4682.18 → 4684.02] do not drop draw cords
[4684.02 → 4685.08] oh okay
[4685.08 → 4686.52] do not drop printed on them
[4686.52 → 4686.88] uh
[4686.88 → 4687.36] the
[4687.36 → 4688.26] hold on
[4688.26 → 4688.72] okay
[4688.72 → 4689.76] you can confuse your
[4689.76 → 4690.66] friends that are
[4690.66 → 4692.12] standing very close
[4692.12 → 4693.10] and looking at a
[4693.10 → 4694.36] interesting part of your body
[4694.36 → 4695.46] yeah it says do not drop there
[4695.46 → 4696.48] little details
[4696.48 → 4697.48] little details
[4697.48 → 4697.82] okay
[4697.82 → 4698.84] uh
[4698.84 → 4699.88] the big hex beach towel
[4699.88 → 4700.66] do you want to do the
[4700.66 → 4701.44] the read for that
[4701.44 → 4702.08] and I'll just show it
[4702.08 → 4702.72] sure
[4702.72 → 4704.64] a huge two-sided
[4704.64 → 4705.62] uh
[4705.62 → 4706.28] towel
[4706.28 → 4707.54] shaped like a hexagon
[4707.54 → 4707.92] because
[4707.92 → 4709.58] why settle for anything less
[4709.58 → 4710.90] than the Pentagon
[4710.90 → 4712.24] uh
[4712.24 → 4714.38] one side is
[4714.38 → 4715.56] a plush velour
[4715.56 → 4716.88] perfect for lounging
[4716.88 → 4718.08] the other side is
[4718.08 → 4719.22] full of terry loops
[4719.22 → 4720.04] to dry off
[4720.04 → 4720.76] after a swim
[4720.76 → 4721.46] that's kind of neat
[4721.46 → 4722.14] uh
[4722.14 → 4722.84] perfect size
[4722.84 → 4723.72] to also use
[4723.72 → 4724.62] as a beach blanket
[4724.62 → 4726.10] uh
[4726.10 → 4726.42] by the way
[4726.42 → 4726.90] this is
[4726.90 → 4728.18] Canadian dollar pricing
[4728.18 → 4729.62] I'm on the global site
[4729.62 → 4731.28] so we'll have to
[4731.28 → 4732.44] clarify what the
[4732.44 → 4733.86] US store pricing
[4733.86 → 4734.64] is after
[4734.64 → 4736.08] there you go
[4736.08 → 4736.44] okay
[4736.44 → 4737.54] and then the last one
[4737.54 → 4738.28] is what
[4738.28 → 4739.06] oh yeah
[4739.06 → 4740.00] touch sand sticker sheet
[4740.00 → 4740.78] so we have a
[4740.78 → 4741.98] touch sand sticker collection

[4744.98 → 4746.06] super cute
[4746.06 → 4747.58] and uh
[4747.58 → 4748.52] I believe
[4748.52 → 4749.48] is this available
[4749.48 → 4750.36] as a bonus bin item
[4750.36 → 4752.62] I believe it should be
[4752.62 → 4753.24] I have no idea
[4753.24 → 4754.38] I'm not 100% sure
[4754.38 → 4755.26] uh
[4755.26 → 4756.12] so yeah let's check
[4756.12 → 4756.90] let's check the
[4756.90 → 4758.16] let's check the US region
[4758.16 → 4759.58] here we go

[4767.20 → 4769.06] big old beach towel
[4769.06 → 4769.90] alright

[4771.32 → 4772.48] I do not see them
[4772.48 → 4773.44] currently in bonus bin
[4773.44 → 4774.12] okay
[4774.12 → 4775.70] I don't know if they're
[4775.70 → 4776.52] a bonus bin item or not
[4776.52 → 4778.62] just got my daughter
[4778.62 → 4779.40] the switch 2
[4779.40 → 4780.50] oh it's enormous
[4780.50 → 4781.38] oh wow
[4781.38 → 4782.90] oh wow
[4782.90 → 4786.62] that was not open
[4786.62 → 4787.46] which is very lucky
[4787.46 → 4788.40] uh
[4788.40 → 4789.34] but it's huge
[4789.34 → 4793.34] and like
[4793.34 → 4793.70] there's
[4793.70 → 4794.32] it's a hexagon
[4794.32 → 4795.12] so there's a bit here
[4795.12 → 4795.62] at the top
[4795.62 → 4796.12] that's like
[4796.12 → 4796.72] whoa
[4796.72 → 4797.70] that's almost as big
[4797.70 → 4798.20] as the table
[4798.20 → 4798.58] yeah
[4798.58 → 4799.76] it's a multi-person
[4799.76 → 4800.48] beach blanket

[4805.62 → 4807.02] just got my daughter
[4807.02 → 4807.66] the switch 2
[4807.66 → 4808.56] is her first console
[4808.56 → 4809.36] gaming device
[4809.36 → 4810.96] what was your first
[4810.96 → 4811.70] gaming device
[4811.70 → 4812.92] and game
[4812.92 → 4813.70] you got to play
[4813.70 → 4815.00] mine was a game boy
[4815.00 → 4815.64] colour with
[4815.64 → 4816.54] Pokémon red
[4816.54 → 4820.82] first
[4820.82 → 4822.16] gaming device
[4822.16 → 4822.74] I mean I think
[4822.74 → 4824.00] the first gaming device
[4824.00 → 4824.82] I ever played on
[4824.82 → 4825.40] would have had to be
[4825.40 → 4826.00] a commodore
[4826.00 → 4827.62] um
[4827.62 → 4830.92] let's go
[4830.92 → 4832.26] let's go non-pc
[4832.26 → 4834.26] hold on
[4834.26 → 4834.84] for both of us
[4834.84 → 4835.30] in that case
[4835.30 → 4836.08] it's going to be pc
[4836.08 → 4837.30] yeah
[4837.30 → 4838.24] um
[4838.24 → 4839.84] I played on my
[4839.84 → 4840.90] friend's nest
[4840.90 → 4843.62] but I had
[4843.62 → 4843.96] oh
[4843.96 → 4844.48] wait
[4844.48 → 4845.14] no
[4845.14 → 4845.62] no
[4845.62 → 4846.84] my grandparents
[4846.84 → 4847.90] had a pong
[4847.90 → 4848.40] machine
[4848.40 → 4849.78] in their basement
[4849.78 → 4851.08] and I think
[4851.08 → 4852.00] I probably
[4852.00 → 4852.72] played on that
[4852.72 → 4853.92] before I had
[4853.92 → 4854.68] a Super Nintendo
[4854.68 → 4855.62] what was the first one
[4855.62 → 4856.52] first console
[4856.52 → 4857.04] that you got
[4857.04 → 4858.06] Super Nintendo
[4858.06 → 4859.18] it's the first one
[4859.18 → 4859.66] I ever had
[4859.66 → 4860.46] first console
[4860.46 → 4860.86] we got was
[4860.86 → 4861.32] Super Nintendo
[4861.32 → 4861.62] as well
[4861.62 → 4861.98] but my
[4861.98 → 4862.56] my grandma
[4862.56 → 4863.50] technically got us
[4863.50 → 4864.82] original game boys
[4864.82 → 4867.10] really
[4867.10 → 4867.78] which I actually
[4867.78 → 4868.38] don't think
[4868.38 → 4869.74] got a lot of use
[4869.74 → 4872.40] the games were
[4872.40 → 4875.34] it was a different time
[4875.34 → 4875.86] we were
[4875.86 → 4876.78] we were more desperate
[4876.78 → 4877.48] for entertainment
[4877.48 → 4878.10] on the go
[4878.10 → 4878.58] yeah
[4878.58 → 4879.42] is what I'll say
[4879.42 → 4880.26] I don't know if
[4880.26 → 4880.94] there's too many
[4880.94 → 4881.82] game boy games
[4881.82 → 4882.32] with the
[4882.32 → 4883.50] sole exception
[4883.50 → 4884.46] of Tetris
[4884.46 → 4886.64] that people are like
[4886.64 → 4887.10] which I don't think
[4887.10 → 4887.46] we had
[4887.46 → 4888.68] banger
[4888.68 → 4889.46] I would
[4889.46 → 4890.64] I would play that

[4908.62 → 4911.84] prepping for his
[4911.84 → 4912.58] future career
[4912.58 → 4913.48] as a reviewer
[4913.48 → 4915.10] from a very young age
[4915.10 → 4918.16] he's just hated

[4921.94 → 4923.64] born to be a hater

[4931.52 → 4932.42] that's fair

[4934.12 → 4934.78] original game boy

[4942.34 → 4942.88] near the end
[4942.88 → 4943.76] and most people
[4943.76 → 4944.36] that I know
[4944.36 → 4945.60] played it on colour
[4945.60 → 4946.58] I played it on
[4946.58 → 4947.34] I didn't play it
[4947.34 → 4948.22] until it was on colour
[4948.22 → 4948.66] yeah

[5582.36 → 5587.16] like yeah okay I don't know how
[5587.16 → 5590.82] that happened discussion question
[5590.82 → 5593.36] is what is the greatest spoof
[5593.36 → 5595.82] parody movie ever made and why is
[5595.82 → 5597.50] it either Space balls or Galaxy
[5597.50 → 5601.98] Quest Adam's thoughts it's
[5601.98 → 5604.12] Airplane like come on Space balls
[5604.12 → 5605.36] isn't even the best Mel Brooks
[5605.36 → 5607.84] film I've never seen Airplane
[5607.84 → 5610.80] maybe I should have that to my
[5610.80 → 5612.00] list of things to watch
[5612.00 → 5615.10] man this is wild outside
[5615.10 → 5616.16] of that you have greats like
[5616.16 → 5618.00] Monty Python's Life of Brian and
[5618.68 → 5622.34] and Holy Grail Spinal Tap the
[5622.34 → 5623.70] Cornett Trilogy Shaun of the
[5623.70 → 5627.18] Dead Hot Fuzz close, and you know
[5627.18 → 5628.98] what you know what's wild is
[5628.98 → 5630.68] between the writer of this topic
[5630.68 → 5633.46] and Adam they've still managed to
[5633.46 → 5635.18] not get it right what do you
[5635.18 → 5636.78] think they've still managed to not
[5636.78 → 5638.00] get it right well first I want to
[5638.00 → 5639.78] be very careful with your words
[5639.78 → 5643.76] excuse me I'm excited to see what
[5643.76 → 5645.04] you're going to say are you going to tell
[5645.04 → 5647.18] me okay nope I want to let Luke go
[5647.18 → 5649.20] first yeah I'm not gonna look at
[5649.20 → 5651.42] chat I'm not a movie person that's
[5651.42 → 5652.96] fair okay I've seen a lot of these okay
[5652.96 → 5654.78] out of this honestly I have seen
[5655.36 → 5665.98] Space balls that's sad I have seen parts
[5665.98 → 5668.70] of Shaun of the Dead oh Shaun of the Dead
[5668.70 → 5671.24] is so good parts of Smile Tap oh I've
[5671.24 → 5675.16] seen Monty Python uh that's something
[5675.16 → 5678.66] Robin Hood men in tights I've seen
[5678.66 → 5680.82] yeah is that what they're referencing
[5680.82 → 5682.56] when they say Robin Hood yeah it's not
[5682.56 → 5684.14] very good okay, so I've seen men in
[5684.14 → 5685.92] tights I would not rank that as number
[5685.92 → 5688.80] one, but it was good I liked it I liked
[5688.80 → 5690.86] it as a very small child yeah I tried
[5690.86 → 5693.24] to watch it again as not a child and I
[5693.24 → 5696.28] was like this is really stupid, so I
[5696.28 → 5697.94] don't know that mileage may vary
[5697.94 → 5699.88] mileage may vary look my taste in
[5699.88 → 5701.68] movies is all over the place as a kid
[5701.68 → 5705.32] I loved um that the terrible Kevin
[5705.32 → 5707.24] Costner Robin Hood Princess Bride is
[5707.24 → 5710.72] not a spoof or parody no Princess Bride
[5710.72 → 5714.82] is well okay it's I don't think so
[5714.82 → 5718.08] maybe I didn't see what it was spoofing
[5718.08 → 5722.80] and parody the book is I don't know
[5722.80 → 5724.66] it's written in a hilarious unique
[5724.66 → 5728.00] way like I and I fell for it like it's
[5728.00 → 5730.56] written as an abridged version of like a
[5730.56 → 5732.98] very boring story that like cuts out all
[5732.98 → 5734.78] the boring stuff, and it's just the good
[5734.78 → 5737.32] parts, and so I actually thought it was
[5737.32 → 5738.92] and I thought I was reading the abridged
[5738.92 → 5740.22] version of the Princess Bride I went
[5740.22 → 5742.20] looking for the actual Princess Bride and
[5742.20 → 5744.64] it's not a thing so the way the author
[5744.64 → 5746.26] writes the book is like hilarious
[5746.26 → 5748.46] he's like yeah something Ada
[5748.46 → 5751.22] Ada lineage something who cares let's
[5751.22 → 5753.32] move on like it's really it's really
[5753.32 → 5756.62] funny that's cool S. Morgen stern is not a
[5756.62 → 5759.56] real author so William Goldman I think
[5759.56 → 5762.72] is the actual author but the book is
[5762.72 → 5765.12] called the Princess Bride by S.
[5765.36 → 5766.72] Morgen stern abridged by William
[5766.72 → 5769.36] like I don't know it's its pretty funny
[5769.36 → 5771.14] it's pretty funny is that a spoof or a
[5771.14 → 5773.02] parody though I don't think it fits in
[5773.02 → 5774.20] I don't think it's a spoof or a parody
[5774.20 → 5775.94] yeah I don't think it fits if it did I
[5775.94 → 5778.08] would vote that one Princess Bride is
[5778.08 → 5780.32] fantastic but yeah I really
[5780.32 → 5783.68] haven't seen okay well the best spoof
[5783.68 → 5786.96] parody is absolutely last action hero and
[5786.96 → 5788.72] anything else is an incorrect answer you
[5788.72 → 5790.26] haven't even seen it that's why I'm
[5790.26 → 5790.82] shaking my head

[5804.38 → 5806.24] said we're going to do eight years ago and
[5806.24 → 5809.46] we haven't done yet Wan show watches
[5809.46 → 5813.48] disorderly asks last action hero is a
[5813.48 → 5819.10] spoof yes except oh I said I hadn't seen
[5819.10 → 5822.56] it except it's a spoof that literally
[5822.56 → 5825.56] stars one of the greatest action heroes
[5825.56 → 5828.10] of all time who was at the top of his
[5828.10 → 5830.70] game at the time it stars Arnold
[5830.70 → 5833.12] Schwarzenegger that's awesome and it's
[5833.12 → 5836.30] poster for this is amazing actually I take
[5836.30 → 5839.20] it back the greatest spoof of all time is
[5839.20 → 5842.06] Disney's enchanted sorry second greatest

[5860.94 → 5863.58] watches are we commentating no
[5863.58 → 5865.74] Wan show 3000 I don't think, so I think
[5865.74 → 5867.92] we got to just enjoy it we can talk about
[5867.92 → 5869.30] it we can talk about it after all right
[5869.30 → 5872.92] I'm down I am down because on it is
[5872.92 → 5874.76] straight up literally just the poster
[5874.76 → 5877.22] McBain makes me very excited you have got
[5877.22 → 5880.12] to be kidding me right now McBain in chat
[5880.12 → 5885.06] says last action hero isn't funny okay
[5885.06 → 5887.54] there's so much to unpack here you are
[5887.54 → 5891.42] not I are not going to have your
[5891.42 → 5894.80] username be a spoof of Arnold
[5894.80 → 5898.10] Schwarzenegger and tell me that Arnold
[5898.10 → 5901.24] Schwarzenegger spoofing his own iconic
[5901.24 → 5906.30] roles is not funny I can't with you, I'm
[5906.30 → 5908.66] sorry, but I can't, it's the second band
[5908.66 → 5909.00] tonight
[5909.00 → 5913.86] keep you keep band I can't with you
[5913.86 → 5919.70] that is some premium tier rage
[5919.70 → 5921.70] bait right there I bet you I bet you
[5921.70 → 5923.38] McBain thinks that you can't melt cheese
[5923.38 → 5925.90] on cheeseburgers effectively it's real
[5925.90 → 5926.34] cheese
[5926.34 → 5931.88] action hero is a real documentary
[5931.88 → 5935.22] anyway absolute kino cinema
[5935.22 → 5939.06] actually oh man we're ignoring happy
[5939.06 → 5942.22] Gilmore happy Gilmore was great
[5942.22 → 5945.20] happy Gilmore is coming yeah who cares
[5945.20 → 5947.02] about that but probably but happy
[5947.02 → 5949.06] Gilmore happy Gilmore one is
[5949.06 → 5952.20] extremely goaded and is absolutely a
[5952.20 → 5952.98] parody movie
[5952.98 → 5958.96] yeah that's tough that's tough
[5958.96 → 5967.18] what's Shrek I don't think that's a
[5967.18 → 5969.26] documentary that doesn't count well
[5969.26 → 5975.16] all right I mean it is oh man you
[5975.16 → 5976.54] could make an argument Shrek's pretty
[5976.54 → 5980.56] great, but I think Shrek is more of its
[5980.56 → 5983.02] own movie than it is I think so parody I
[5983.02 → 5986.12] think so, and I think you could probably
[5986.12 → 5988.32] make the same kind of argument about like
[5988.32 → 5989.48] something like enchanted or happy
[5989.48 → 5991.10] Gilmore where they actually do stand on
[5991.10 → 5992.68] their own as movies they're not just
[5992.68 → 5994.22] parodying a thing whereas like Austin
[5994.22 → 5996.30] Powers would be an example of a movie
[5996.30 → 5998.76] that has absolutely no substance
[5998.76 → 6001.88] whatsoever other than parodying the
[6001.88 → 6005.78] source material yeah yeah Austin Powers
[6005.78 → 6008.22] yeah I agree McBain we can agree on this
[6008.22 → 6011.40] Austin Powers did not age well I watched
[6011.40 → 6014.60] it with my son, and I was like not only do I
[6014.60 → 6016.38] not think it's funny anymore, but he didn't
[6016.38 → 6017.88] even think it was funny, and he's 12
[6017.88 → 6020.36] literally the target audience for it that
[6020.36 → 6023.04] is rough yeah would uh with the weird
[6023.04 → 6026.78] owl movie count as satire or parody the
[6026.78 → 6029.36] weird owl movie no that's I think it's
[6029.36 → 6031.40] meant to be like I haven't watched it but I
[6031.40 → 6032.26] thought it was meant to be at least
[6032.26 → 6036.24] somewhat biographical oh absolutely in no
[6036.24 → 6039.08] way oh okay never mind it's definitely
[6039.08 → 6043.14] satire of autobiographical kind of
[6043.14 → 6045.20] things mockumentary I haven't seen it
[6045.20 → 6046.80] then, but then that's that's the problem
[6046.80 → 6048.48] then maybe it's great, and I just haven't
[6048.48 → 6050.72] seen it I think Tropic Thunder is a spoof or
[6050.72 → 6054.64] parody no it is of what of a genre so
[6054.64 → 6056.90] that someone asked to like what is what
[6056.90 → 6059.14] is Happy Gilmore a spoof or parody of
[6059.78 → 6062.24] sports movies like they're like what's the
[6062.24 → 6063.68] source material for Happy Gilmore it's not
[6063.68 → 6066.78] just golf no, but it's its it came along
[6066.78 → 6070.64] after Caddy shack so it was like later but
[6070.64 → 6073.92] it was of the genre of like sports and
[6073.92 → 6074.94] golf movies
[6074.94 → 6077.50] um
[6077.50 → 6082.58] ragùs says in the army now with Pauline
[6082.58 → 6085.26] short no I really don't think so now we
[6085.26 → 6088.54] can move on all right way to go
[6088.54 → 6091.42] dude no Pauline short movie belongs on a
[6091.42 → 6093.50] the greatest anything of every of any amount
[6093.50 → 6096.78] of time I'm sorry Paul blast male up
[6096.78 → 6101.48] Wikipedia halt AI summary trial after
[6101.48 → 6104.14] editor backlash the free encyclopedia
[6104.14 → 6106.56] terminated a two-week test of AI powered
[6106.56 → 6110.14] simple article summaries that was sorry I'm
[6110.14 → 6112.06] going to leave you guys not a fantastic idea
[6112.06 → 6114.38] I'll be right back or they terminated
[6114.38 → 6116.62] early after massive backlash from their
[6116.62 → 6119.08] community of volunteer editors and
[6119.08 → 6122.82] contributors I recently did my first ever
[6122.82 → 6126.00] actual real Wikipedia contribution and it
[6126.00 → 6130.62] seems to have been accepted so go me the AI
[6130.62 → 6132.66] summaries were placed at the top of
[6132.66 → 6135.24] articles above the existing human written
[6135.24 → 6140.24] article summaries known as the lead in the
[6140.24 → 6143.10] Wikipedia community the AI section was
[6143.10 → 6145.46] tagged as unverified and included a
[6145.46 → 6147.54] disclaimer that the AI does not follow
[6147.54 → 6149.56] Wikipedia's accepted editorial process
[6149.56 → 6152.06] feedback from the editor community was
[6152.06 → 6155.96] immediate and overwhelmingly negative as it
[6155.96 → 6158.82] should have been ranging from yuck and
[6158.82 → 6161.82] catastrophic decision to essays tearing
[6161.82 → 6164.02] apart the quality of the demo summaries
[6164.02 → 6166.26] which I think you need that whole range to
[6166.26 → 6167.94] really tear something down so good job
[6167.94 → 6172.56] and others arguing that AI summaries do not
[6172.56 → 6174.66] align with communities values and that such
[6174.66 → 6178.08] features will do immediate and irreversible harm to our
[6178.08 → 6196.70] reputation which honestly I think is true many editors have suggested they'll stop time oh I guess I get it time donations sure time and monetary donations if AI features go forward discussion question how reliable do you consider Wikipedia does add AI summaries make it more or less reliable I will say back into my day when we were in school teachers would not allow us to cite Wikipedia as well
[6196.70 → 6226.60] now the clever people would cite the sources that Wikipedia cited as a source and then just run with that, but some people didn't apparently people are saying their still not allowed to and that's kind of fair I guess because you should probably cite the source that Wikipedia used to write a pen on Twitter down on Twitter and Google Street
[6226.60 → 6230.82] but I do generally see Wikipedia as pretty reliable.
[6231.44 → 6233.32] Adding AI summaries, yeah,
[6233.46 → 6236.42] that would make me immediately not treated as reliable,
[6236.70 → 6238.04] like instantly.
[6238.30 → 6240.42] But I would also just scroll past the AI summary.
[6241.50 → 6243.62] Are we talking about citations from AI
[6243.62 → 6246.56] because that would greatly enhance the Google AI results?
[6247.68 → 6249.56] If I could just check the citations.
[6250.18 → 6250.80] Can you not?
[6251.00 → 6253.02] No, they're not there that I'm aware of.
[6254.02 → 6255.92] How to make chocolate chip cookies, I don't know.
[6256.60 → 6264.66] Seriously, how's there no AI result?
[6270.80 → 6271.24] Seriously?
[6272.66 → 6273.56] There's no...
[6273.56 → 6274.52] Where's your AI summary?
[6274.78 → 6275.20] I don't know.
[6276.82 → 6278.52] The one time I want it.
[6278.62 → 6278.90] Yeah.
[6279.90 → 6280.52] That's weird.
[6281.66 → 6284.08] How do I build a PC here?
[6284.26 → 6285.02] Yeah, because I thought it did.
[6285.02 → 6285.98] I got an AI overview.
[6286.60 → 6288.02] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6288.02 → 6289.16] Oh, wait, this here...
[6289.16 → 6290.04] How did I not notice that?
[6290.14 → 6290.34] Yeah.
[6291.90 → 6295.04] How's it going to cite every one of these?
[6295.38 → 6296.66] That's not a...
[6296.66 → 6301.02] Well, this is often how you find out
[6301.02 → 6302.44] that it's just making junk up.
[6302.76 → 6303.84] Yeah, I guess.
[6304.90 → 6307.70] Okay, I was looking down here.
[6307.70 → 6310.04] So I'm an idiot, I guess.
[6310.10 → 6310.34] Where you would expect.
[6310.34 → 6318.80] I was looking down here, and I was expecting, like, a comprehensive thing of, like, all the links
[6318.80 → 6321.04] instead of just being here.
[6321.60 → 6323.88] Somebody in Full Pain Chat, Pinky Draws, says,
[6324.02 → 6327.04] I wouldn't trust Wikipedia for contentious topics and public figures.
[6327.04 → 6328.60] And, yeah, I think it's more...
[6328.60 → 6331.36] I would trust it based on the topic.
[6332.32 → 6336.80] I've definitely found sites that are far less accurate than Wikipedia.
[6337.38 → 6341.80] And, like, my point of reference would be information about people that I know,
[6342.12 → 6346.60] like information about myself, or information about, you know, Luke and stuff like that.
[6346.60 → 6355.00] Like, there's definitely communities and sources of information that I'm just like,
[6355.06 → 6359.04] yeah, you just obviously make things up, and you have no idea what you're talking about.
[6359.10 → 6362.72] Whereas Wikipedia, even though there are little details that are wrong,
[6364.22 → 6365.20] it's generally...
[6365.20 → 6365.62] It's generally pretty good.
[6365.90 → 6367.62] It's generally pretty close.
[6367.88 → 6369.60] Like, here, let's have a look at my...
[6370.28 → 6372.66] Let's have a look at my Wikipedia.
[6375.40 → 6376.40] Yes, I am Canadian.
[6376.60 → 6378.86] Yes, I'm a YouTuber.
[6379.38 → 6381.60] I'm known for channels that cover technology.
[6381.76 → 6382.26] Pretty good.
[6383.50 → 6384.10] Pretty good.
[6385.04 → 6388.02] I disagree with the way that they're measuring this.
[6389.02 → 6392.14] You can't just add subscriber counts like that.
[6392.16 → 6392.56] Yeah, that doesn't really work.
[6392.58 → 6393.50] It doesn't really mean anything.
[6393.94 → 6394.60] But they're not...
[6394.60 → 6395.72] It's not technically inaccurate.
[6396.04 → 6396.72] Yeah, they're not wrong.
[6396.72 → 6397.30] It just doesn't mean anything.
[6398.74 → 6400.20] Yes, this is true.
[6401.16 → 6402.54] Founder, former chief executive,
[6402.74 → 6405.28] on a step-down and took the role of chief vision officer.
[6405.28 → 6407.52] And, okay, boom, that takes you to that.
[6407.60 → 6408.92] Yep, so far, pretty good.
[6409.02 → 6411.68] Wait, from 2007, you were a presenter for NCI?
[6413.72 → 6414.46] Wait, no.
[6414.92 → 6415.50] Wait, yes.
[6417.40 → 6417.58] Hmm.
[6418.32 → 6419.66] Technology videos in 2007?
[6420.12 → 6420.30] No.
[6420.56 → 6421.46] Yeah, that's wrong.
[6421.66 → 6421.96] Thank you.
[6421.96 → 6422.60] Thank you, Luke.
[6424.18 → 6426.76] And I think I went past 2013 as well.
[6427.32 → 6427.76] You did.
[6427.98 → 6428.38] I did.
[6428.38 → 6430.14] So this date is wrong.
[6430.42 → 6430.58] Yeah.
[6430.70 → 6430.96] Okay.
[6431.22 → 6434.72] Give it like 30 minutes and somebody will have that updated with this as a citation.
[6435.00 → 6436.68] I am the only source.
[6436.98 → 6441.84] So as a primary source, I think this is kind of...
[6441.84 → 6442.44] I don't think...
[6442.44 → 6443.70] Is that how biographies work?
[6443.78 → 6446.20] That would be an autobiography, probably, I guess.
[6446.50 → 6449.42] Don't you have to check with a third-party source before you can have a biography of someone?
[6449.42 → 6450.50] What is the source for that?
[6450.50 → 6452.04] I also grew up on a hobby farm.
[6452.18 → 6453.58] I did not grow up on a real farm.
[6453.72 → 6461.32] I have always made sure to distinguish between that we raised animals versus that we did it commercially.
[6461.64 → 6463.80] There were a couple of occasions where we engaged in...
[6463.80 → 6465.68] I didn't actually know that's what that distinction was.
[6465.70 → 6467.32] A little bit of commercial activity.
[6467.46 → 6472.60] We sold eggs to, like, a local natural health food store at some point.
[6472.84 → 6474.92] But that was over a very short period of time.
[6475.38 → 6476.74] So I grew up on a hobby farm.
[6476.86 → 6477.64] Not the same thing.
[6477.64 → 6480.58] I have been married to Yvonne Ho since...
[6480.58 → 6481.04] Nope.
[6481.20 → 6482.58] That is not our anniversary date.
[6482.64 → 6485.24] But maybe I spread that misinformation on purpose.
[6485.34 → 6486.20] I'm actually not sure.
[6487.20 → 6489.38] A source is Bixby Showcase.
[6489.72 → 6490.16] Okay.
[6490.88 → 6492.46] Father of three children, son, two daughters.
[6492.58 → 6493.24] That is accurate.
[6494.08 → 6497.56] So, I mean, we can keep going if you guys are into it.
[6497.58 → 6498.14] That's not your signature.
[6498.64 → 6499.64] It's a...
[6499.64 → 6501.22] Was it 2006 you just said?
[6501.74 → 6502.46] For NCI?
[6503.54 → 6506.20] This has from 2007 to 2013.
[6506.60 → 6507.12] Refresh the page.
[6507.64 → 6508.54] Refresh the page?
[6508.78 → 6509.66] I told you.
[6510.54 → 6510.90] What?
[6511.42 → 6513.02] People have theoretically already fixed it.
[6513.14 → 6513.74] Well, yeah, okay.
[6513.80 → 6514.36] That's fine.
[6514.44 → 6516.04] But, like, let's not do that.
[6516.38 → 6518.24] That's not the point of this exercise right now.
[6519.84 → 6520.84] Was asked to be the host.
[6521.46 → 6524.38] Sebastian shot videos with a camera borrowed from the son of the company's president.
[6524.50 → 6525.32] That is true.
[6525.42 → 6528.02] But I am the only source of that piece of information.
[6528.36 → 6531.48] So, you know, I could be an unreliable person.
[6532.62 → 6533.90] This is not true.
[6533.90 → 6534.90] This is...
[6534.90 → 6535.18] Whoa.
[6536.68 → 6539.30] This is 100% incorrect.
[6539.30 → 6552.40] It was actually due to high production costs and excellent viewership during the early days of the NCI Tech Tips channel.
[6552.40 → 6556.90] That was the reason I was instructed to create Linus Tech Tips as a cheaper offshoot.
[6557.42 → 6558.58] The problem...
[6558.58 → 6561.54] Why would anybody create a sequel of this?
[6563.12 → 6564.62] What do you...
[6564.62 → 6572.74] Like, that's a fundamental, complete misunderstanding, not only of what I said, but also of just any reason for anyone doing anything ever.
[6573.08 → 6573.68] And I don't...
[6573.68 → 6576.16] I'm not trying to, like, be mean or anything right now.
[6576.28 → 6583.62] I'm just trying to draw a little bit of attention here to the way that things can be not just misrepresented or...
[6583.62 → 6584.22] Or...
[6584.22 → 6598.28] But fundamentally, the world misunderstood to such a degree that in your attempt to interpret what someone else is saying, you could completely miss the point in a way that just would obviously make no sense.
[6598.30 → 6600.34] You could have also just, like, served a sentence.
[6600.88 → 6604.76] And that is the one that ended up getting quoted in there or whatever.
[6604.82 → 6605.80] I guess that's possible.
[6605.84 → 6607.10] A lot of things are said.
[6607.30 → 6608.88] I've served things before.
[6609.14 → 6609.62] That is a thing.
[6609.62 → 6610.40] That is a thing.
[6610.40 → 6612.48] It is a thing that happens to all.
[6612.62 → 6619.86] So it was actually because viewership was good and growing, and our brand partners wanted more.
[6620.42 → 6624.94] But the costs and, more importantly, the time investment was too high.
[6625.68 → 6635.64] And so we had to find a way to produce videos faster so that we could have more videos up on our product pages without putting this amount of time into them.
[6635.64 → 6641.96] And my comment there bolsters your argument of having multiple sources for one piece of information.
[6642.12 → 6642.36] Yes.
[6642.44 → 6645.68] Because it's less likely you might have, like, someone who misquoted or whatever.
[6645.76 → 6648.86] Tiger Direct TV was absolutely a competitor in the early days.
[6649.10 → 6650.18] New egg came later.
[6651.32 → 6653.08] After us, if I recall correctly.
[6653.98 → 6655.04] Linus Tech Tips was created.
[6655.70 → 6656.32] This and the other.
[6656.50 → 6656.64] Yeah.
[6656.76 → 6659.24] Found Linus Media Group following a dispute regarding company management.
[6659.36 → 6659.64] Ah, yeah.
[6659.66 → 6662.06] That's vague enough that I would say that's probably fine.
[6662.06 → 6666.94] There was a lot more to it than just the non-compete.
[6667.06 → 6673.58] I also signed a long-term agreement to help them build their team, which included the hiring of Riley, actually, who now works here.
[6674.48 → 6675.78] So there was a bit more to it.
[6675.84 → 6679.68] But, yes, a non-compete clause was a critical part of this negotiation.
[6679.80 → 6683.26] That much I would categorize as incomplete but correct.
[6684.54 → 6688.74] Stepping down as chief executive officer, creative role, and continues to be involved with writing and production.
[6688.86 → 6689.40] Yes, it's true.
[6689.50 → 6691.40] I'm involved in more than just writing and production.
[6691.40 → 6697.24] You can't have a vision for a company that does a lot more than just make media without being involved in other things.
[6698.50 → 6702.00] Controversy emerged via an investigative video by YouTube creator Gamers Nexus.
[6702.28 → 6703.24] I think you mean hit piece.
[6703.76 → 6705.72] There were investigative elements of it.
[6706.16 → 6708.32] But let's not mince words at this point.
[6708.74 → 6711.74] I've had a chance to show our side of the story at this point.
[6711.84 → 6714.02] So let's not pretend it's anything other than what it was.
[6714.72 → 6719.02] Which described issues specific to both Sebastian as an individual and of Linus Media Group as a whole.
[6719.02 → 6722.44] The report detailed how negatively reviewed a prototype water block.
[6722.54 → 6723.48] That was never a review.
[6723.66 → 6725.36] Never called it a review, and it never was.
[6726.20 → 6729.10] Billet Labs, despite installing it on hardware for which it was not designed.
[6729.60 → 6732.88] So there are a lot of little details that have not been updated here.
[6733.64 → 6736.16] Sebastian also failed to return the water block to Billet Labs.
[6736.54 → 6738.00] Sebastian had nothing to do with it.
[6738.00 → 6741.46] Sebastian found out about it when the hit piece went up.
[6742.04 → 6750.36] I knew nothing about us being asked to return it because we're an organization that at that time was already close to 100 people.
[6751.80 → 6752.52] So it's...
[6753.36 → 6754.74] This is true.
[6755.00 → 6756.84] Systemic issues relating to...
[6756.84 → 6757.60] Oh, systemic issues.
[6757.62 → 6759.52] Yeah, there were systemic issues that...
[6759.52 → 6761.76] And that's the part that is accurate.
[6761.90 → 6762.52] That I have to...
[6762.52 → 6763.44] That I got to own, right?
[6763.92 → 6764.82] Like, that's the thing.
[6765.12 → 6770.52] It's just because I'm saying some of these things are wrong doesn't mean that all of them were wrong.
[6772.48 → 6775.12] The company paused video production while it investigated the claims.
[6775.24 → 6776.00] That is true.
[6776.58 → 6778.12] This is also true.
[6778.78 → 6781.34] Personal Life said his favourite YouTubers were...
[6781.34 → 6783.00] I mean, yeah, that's...
[6783.00 → 6784.18] That's something.
[6786.26 → 6787.28] I'll be honest with you.
[6787.38 → 6790.52] I threw out Total Biscuit because he was one of the few names of YouTubers that I knew.
[6790.52 → 6796.96] I've never really watched a ton of YouTube, but I mean, he was my favourite in the sense that I had talked to him, and he seemed cool.
[6797.56 → 6800.76] I don't know if I ever actually watched one of his videos all the way through, though.
[6801.12 → 6807.34] But at the time, that was probably also true of Marques and Austin because I just didn't have time to watch YouTube.
[6808.54 → 6809.58] This is true.
[6811.72 → 6812.90] And this is true.
[6812.98 → 6813.66] Oh, great.
[6813.98 → 6816.44] These are the three things in my personal life.
[6817.16 → 6819.08] Multi-factor authentication fatigue attack.
[6819.08 → 6819.68] Nice.
[6820.96 → 6821.90] Wait, 2023.
[6822.22 → 6825.06] Multi-factor authentication fatigue attack?
[6826.44 → 6826.98] Oh, wait.
[6827.76 → 6828.94] No, that's not what kind it was.
[6829.14 → 6829.42] No.
[6829.48 → 6830.44] No, this was the hack.
[6830.64 → 6830.84] Yeah.
[6830.92 → 6831.96] That's not what happened at all.
[6832.68 → 6832.94] Yeah.
[6833.06 → 6833.98] Luke caught another one.
[6834.28 → 6835.42] What's that citation?
[6835.66 → 6836.52] Where did they...
[6836.52 → 6837.24] Where did that...
[6837.24 → 6837.86] They referenced it?
[6837.86 → 6838.08] Oh, here.
[6838.12 → 6838.58] I'll click it.
[6838.70 → 6839.50] It was our video.
[6840.80 → 6842.52] So the citation is right.
[6842.52 → 6844.28] My channel was deleted last night.
[6845.10 → 6847.34] But the interpretation of it is completely wrong.
[6847.34 → 6851.40] It was actually a cookie hijacking attack.
[6851.92 → 6852.04] Yeah.
[6852.14 → 6856.00] It was a screensaver file that was supposed to be...
[6856.00 → 6859.38] It was disguised as a PDF and then they session hijacked.
[6859.50 → 6863.34] So this was an interesting exercise, I hope, for people in...
[6864.74 → 6865.58] Nothing is true.
[6865.70 → 6866.44] Everything is permitted.
[6867.28 → 6868.90] Assassin's Creed has been based the whole time.
[6869.00 → 6869.68] Let's go.
[6869.68 → 6873.08] And here's what I'll say, though.
[6873.34 → 6876.22] I'll repeat what I said before we started this.
[6876.96 → 6883.82] Compared to almost any other source that I have found, Wikipedia is worlds more accurate.
[6883.82 → 6884.42] Quite good.
[6885.02 → 6890.82] In terms of the things that I actually know, like the details of my own life.
[6891.48 → 6893.10] And one of the really cool things about just...
[6893.10 → 6893.72] Worlds more accurate.
[6893.72 → 6904.14] Wikipedia as a system is as you correct those types of things when people update it, if it gets changed back to something that's wrong, then there's like a back and forth and they kind of like fight it out.
[6904.14 → 6907.30] And there's now this piece of information.
[6907.54 → 6911.20] Like in your own argument, you're saying like you need two different references for something.
[6911.44 → 6914.84] This is still information just coming from you about these things.
[6914.84 → 6918.24] So like it's not technically perfect and Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada.
[6919.58 → 6920.34] Yes, you're right.
[6920.42 → 6920.62] Sorry.
[6920.72 → 6922.68] It was a session token, not a session cookie.
[6923.02 → 6923.82] I misspoke.
[6924.68 → 6925.54] Which I can do.
[6926.54 → 6929.76] What a perfect illustration of Luke's point.
[6930.86 → 6931.04] Yeah.
[6931.26 → 6931.46] Yeah.
[6931.46 → 6938.30] Me when I'm like 15 or something.
[6938.56 → 6938.90] Yeah.
[6939.58 → 6939.82] Yeah.
[6939.90 → 6940.62] Desktop background.
[6941.34 → 6941.68] Yeah.
[6942.22 → 6944.00] I still have that as a duvet.
[6944.22 → 6944.52] Yeah.
[6944.84 → 6946.94] So edgy.
[6949.28 → 6950.98] It was such a sick game, dude.
[6951.42 → 6952.90] Ragùs is on fire tonight.
[6953.50 → 6955.02] Reading Wikipedia is so inaccurate.
[6955.30 → 6957.54] Watching every single WAN show is far more reliable.
[6959.36 → 6960.26] I don't know.
[6960.46 → 6962.32] They don't change between week to week.
[6964.92 → 6966.70] What are we even talking about?
[6966.74 → 6967.88] What's our topic right now?
[6968.26 → 6969.34] I don't remember where we started.
[6969.34 → 6969.70] Wikipedia.
[6970.18 → 6970.92] AI summaries.
[6971.16 → 6971.44] Oh, yeah.
[6971.48 → 6971.66] Right.
[6971.84 → 6972.02] Yeah.
[6972.02 → 6973.10] We're not even that far off.
[6973.24 → 6973.40] Yeah.
[6973.40 → 6979.26] AI summaries of, as you can see, not accurate information.
[6979.68 → 6979.88] Bad.
[6979.88 → 6980.38] I don't know.
[6980.38 → 6980.74] Yeah.
[6981.04 → 6987.22] But we're going down the translation of a translation chain, and it almost never leads to good results.
[6987.30 → 6990.60] Can I just say as well, they said here, like there's a what do they call it?
[6990.60 → 6991.50] The lead or something.
[6991.50 → 6992.18] Yeah.
[6992.18 → 6997.12] The article summaries written by humans known as the lead on Wikipedia are good.
[6998.38 → 7001.10] Like, I don't think we needed this, to be honest.
[7001.10 → 7005.58] Like, usually if I'm scrolling down in a Wikipedia article, it's because I have read the lead.
[7005.84 → 7009.96] I kind of understand what's going on, and I just desire for more information.
[7009.96 → 7011.86] The summary is already very good.
[7011.98 → 7017.88] Like, people do, Wikipedia is a wild thing that exists at all and I cherish it.
[7018.06 → 7019.00] Anyway, moving on.
[7020.46 → 7022.48] We should do a main topic now, maybe?
[7022.62 → 7023.50] We have a bunch of those.
[7024.18 → 7024.82] Android 16?
[7024.82 → 7024.88] Android 16?
[7026.76 → 7034.26] Earlier this week, Google announced that Android 16 is available and starting to roll out to pixel owners using a Pixel 6 or newer.
[7034.78 → 7041.84] Android 16 is laying the foundation for the new Material 3 expressive design language, which is expected in September of this year.
[7041.84 → 7053.24] Material 3 expressive is supposed to bring us a revamped quick settings panel, physics-based animations, dynamic colour schemes, background blur effects, and more.
[7053.24 → 7056.28] There's an optional 30-second video that we can watch.
[7056.36 → 7057.18] Are you queuing that?
[7057.36 → 7057.78] No.
[7057.78 → 7064.60] This is just hilarious because someone was updating this in real time, and now it's incorrect for a different reason.
[7065.12 → 7066.76] Ah, no.
[7069.22 → 7069.58] No.
[7069.58 → 7071.26] Session token hijacking attacks.
[7071.30 → 7074.22] See, first party resources can lie.
[7074.46 → 7074.76] Oh, shoot.
[7074.90 → 7075.44] Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[7075.84 → 7076.90] Sorry, sorry.
[7076.94 → 7077.38] I was muted.
[7077.98 → 7081.64] I was pointing out that now it's wrong for a completely new reason.
[7081.64 → 7084.26] Session token hijacking attack.
[7084.58 → 7086.00] I think I said it right, but I don't remember.
[7086.12 → 7090.16] Anyway, here's our 30-second video.
[7092.12 → 7094.72] Dude, are designs getting more interesting again?
[7095.18 → 7097.08] Are we out of the dark ages of design?
[7097.98 → 7098.30] Maybe?
[7098.30 → 7100.46] The top menu still seems too giant.
[7100.88 → 7101.86] Go back to Android 10.
[7102.26 → 7104.22] There's, like, animations and stuff.
[7104.68 → 7105.60] It's not clear.
[7105.72 → 7106.60] I don't like it.
[7106.60 → 7110.66] Things aren't, like, just squares everywhere and boring.
[7111.62 → 7112.96] Look, things look interesting.
[7113.76 → 7114.72] That's so exciting!
[7115.26 → 7116.30] I like iOS 26.
[7116.86 → 7120.92] Me too, but I'm excited that this seems to be happening a little bit.
[7121.38 → 7122.60] I like iOS 26 better.
[7122.70 → 7123.28] Needs more glass.
[7123.92 → 7124.32] I was muted.
[7124.66 → 7124.90] Oh.
[7125.78 → 7126.30] Because I'm eating.
[7126.46 → 7126.82] I'm hungry.
[7127.00 → 7127.10] I'm so hungry.
[7127.10 → 7127.60] I got you.
[7127.82 → 7128.02] Yeah.
[7128.02 → 7130.72] Have dinner on your own time.
[7131.58 → 7131.94] Yeah.
[7132.18 → 7135.04] Way to be mean or something.
[7135.16 → 7135.44] I don't know.
[7135.60 → 7136.34] I lost track of that one.
[7136.48 → 7139.18] Speaking of me being mean, I have an idea.
[7140.18 → 7141.44] Why don't we do movie night tonight?
[7141.96 → 7143.08] I know you guys aren't doing anything.
[7144.06 → 7144.30] Got them.
[7145.58 → 7147.10] I am, actually.
[7147.38 → 7147.66] Can we do tomorrow night?
[7148.48 → 7150.80] There's no way you guys have plans on a Friday night.
[7150.86 → 7151.82] You've got to be kidding me.
[7151.86 → 7152.40] Both of you.
[7152.84 → 7153.24] Unfortunately.
[7153.24 → 7155.60] I don't believe you, and I don't believe you.
[7155.60 → 7158.54] For a rare time, I do, actually.
[7158.86 → 7160.08] I can explain it.
[7160.16 → 7161.04] I'll have to type it.
[7162.52 → 7166.62] And it's not, like, cool.
[7167.96 → 7168.48] All right.
[7168.58 → 7168.86] Fine.
[7169.00 → 7169.46] I'll allow it.
[7169.56 → 7170.74] I can type it, though, if you want.
[7170.84 → 7171.02] Okay.
[7171.04 → 7171.76] Maybe next week, then.
[7172.36 → 7172.66] Okay.
[7173.42 → 7173.72] Okay.
[7173.94 → 7174.50] I'm down next week.
[7174.50 → 7176.74] There's no way you guys have plans two Fridays in a row.
[7177.26 → 7178.06] There's no way.
[7178.26 → 7178.66] Yeah.
[7179.40 → 7180.12] I don't believe you.
[7180.12 → 7182.32] I made fake goods for mine.
[7182.74 → 7183.10] All right.
[7183.18 → 7183.48] Fine.
[7183.60 → 7184.04] I'll allow it.
[7184.04 → 7184.86] I definitely did not make fake goods for mine.
[7184.86 → 7185.08] But wait.
[7185.08 → 7186.18] Do you guys have a hard out tonight?
[7186.32 → 7188.62] Like, do we need to wrap pretty soon, or what?
[7188.68 → 7189.82] No, by, like, 1 a.m.
[7190.50 → 7190.94] Oh, wow.
[7191.10 → 7192.04] What does that even...
[7192.04 → 7193.38] Well, see, that's what I'm talking about, then.
[7193.42 → 7196.18] If we wrap by, like, 9, then we go watch a movie, and then you go to your thing.
[7196.80 → 7197.34] No, no, no.
[7197.34 → 7198.58] The thing ends at, like, 1 a.m.
[7198.92 → 7200.04] Oh, that makes more sense.
[7200.48 → 7200.74] All right.
[7200.74 → 7200.94] Fine.
[7200.96 → 7201.28] Next week.
[7201.70 → 7206.14] I don't have a super hard out, but I do have to be home at a certain point.
[7206.52 → 7208.16] Let's see what next week looks like.
[7209.08 → 7209.36] Pathetic.
[7210.04 → 7210.20] Pathetic.
[7210.20 → 7211.00] It's a good reason.
[7211.46 → 7212.04] No, I get it.
[7212.04 → 7212.38] I get it.
[7212.42 → 7212.70] I get it.
[7212.86 → 7213.04] Okay.
[7213.04 → 7214.42] Next week, I'm good.
[7214.42 → 7214.94] What was I going to say?
[7215.12 → 7216.04] But, uh...
[7217.36 → 7218.90] Yeah, next week I'm super down.
[7219.04 → 7220.28] Next week might be interesting.
[7222.68 → 7223.08] Why?
[7223.18 → 7224.06] I'm sure we'll be fine.
[7225.26 → 7225.80] Oh, that.
[7226.10 → 7226.28] Yeah.
[7226.46 → 7227.14] Oh, it's that.
[7227.14 → 7228.18] Okay, that might not make sense.
[7228.70 → 7229.38] Oh, hey.
[7229.62 → 7230.90] I have an update for you.
[7231.68 → 7233.62] You finished Final Fantasy VI.
[7234.16 → 7234.56] Congratulations.
[7235.02 → 7235.32] Thank you.
[7235.48 → 7236.10] Here's your trophy.
[7236.72 → 7237.30] Oh, thank you.
[7237.30 → 7238.04] Actually, I need this.
[7238.04 → 7238.46] This is mine.
[7238.52 → 7239.36] Can you show me how to do this?
[7239.52 → 7239.94] Uh, yeah.
[7239.94 → 7240.30] Do you just twist it?
[7240.32 → 7240.82] I'll show you later.
[7240.92 → 7241.08] Okay.
[7241.42 → 7243.38] Um, I...
[7243.38 → 7243.70] Oh.
[7244.62 → 7245.72] I got over...
[7245.72 → 7246.48] That's why you have the towel.
[7246.66 → 7247.66] I got over the line.
[7252.46 → 7253.96] It's big enough for me, too.
[7254.92 → 7255.28] Damn.
[7256.44 → 7256.84] Damn.
[7256.84 → 7257.04] Damn.
[7257.04 → 7257.14] Damn.
[7257.14 → 7261.64] Linus, bring the swimming drunk.
[7264.20 → 7265.90] They can change the...
[7265.90 → 7266.90] You see the pattern.
[7267.64 → 7268.68] Don't do it in a hot tub.
[7268.74 → 7269.48] It's not hygienic.
[7277.06 → 7277.50] Okay.
[7277.88 → 7278.86] Um, sorry.
[7279.22 → 7280.14] Uh, you're...
[7280.14 → 7280.88] Sorry, painting?
[7281.08 → 7283.56] Mere days after Luke finished Final Fantasy VI,
[7283.56 → 7285.88] which is kind of wild for a competition that went on,
[7285.98 → 7286.98] I think, for over a year.
[7287.14 → 7287.82] Yeah, it did.
[7287.96 → 7291.64] Um, I dropped off my parts at the, uh,
[7291.66 → 7292.74] at the motorcycle shop,
[7292.78 → 7294.80] and they are going to make some time for me,
[7294.84 → 7295.02] I think,
[7295.06 → 7297.84] because they're so tired of looking at the pieces of my bike
[7297.84 → 7299.20] in their shop for two years.
[7299.50 → 7300.28] Wait, what?
[7300.38 → 7301.56] They've been there for two years.
[7301.58 → 7303.18] I thought you had them at your house.
[7303.74 → 7304.10] No.
[7304.66 → 7306.20] I have all the paintable pieces,
[7306.20 → 7306.88] but I didn't...
[7306.88 → 7307.98] I don't have, like, the engine.
[7308.20 → 7308.88] Oh, that's fantastic.
[7308.88 → 7309.72] What would I do with it?
[7309.90 → 7310.42] I thought...
[7310.42 → 7312.62] I mean, I didn't think they were going to store it the whole time.
[7313.34 → 7314.16] I am...
[7314.16 → 7315.84] Well, I prepaid, so...
[7315.84 → 7316.34] Oh, okay.
[7316.34 → 7317.84] It could be worse.
[7318.02 → 7320.68] It's not like I just, like, dropped my stuff off and was like...
[7320.68 → 7322.46] Have they been, like, raging at you this whole time?
[7322.62 → 7322.90] No.
[7323.34 → 7323.68] Cool.
[7323.76 → 7325.16] They've actually been very understanding.
[7325.28 → 7326.88] Once we're done and everything's done,
[7327.02 → 7328.86] I'll probably shout them out,
[7328.94 → 7330.76] assuming everything, like, goes according to plan.
[7330.94 → 7331.52] Go decently enough, yeah.
[7331.52 → 7334.54] Realistically, I don't think that he wants more business right now.
[7334.80 → 7336.30] When I asked him about it, he's like,
[7336.76 → 7338.94] Yeah, I'm working, like, 70-hour weeks right now.
[7339.06 → 7339.80] I'll get to it.
[7340.00 → 7340.72] I'm gonna...
[7340.72 → 7341.46] I'll prioritize it.
[7341.46 → 7341.88] I'll make it work.
[7341.94 → 7343.00] I'm like, yo, buddy, thanks.
[7343.94 → 7346.04] But, yeah, he seems pretty busy right now.
[7346.04 → 7348.70] I guess probably summer reasons and stuff.
[7348.80 → 7349.88] Factor Genius asks,
[7350.08 → 7351.38] Two years, why?
[7352.20 → 7353.56] With five question marks.
[7354.56 → 7357.88] Because I had to restart several times.
[7358.24 → 7359.96] And it was very demoralizing.
[7360.54 → 7362.52] And there was one point where I was, like,
[7362.62 → 7363.98] making, like, perfect progress.
[7364.18 → 7365.56] And then literally my sister died.
[7366.08 → 7367.10] And, like, just...
[7367.10 → 7369.22] It's been one thing after another.
[7369.36 → 7371.30] Every time I get momentum on this project,
[7372.50 → 7374.00] something happens.
[7374.88 → 7377.28] Like, I ran out of one of the colours.
[7377.58 → 7379.80] And then I, like, couldn't go back to the shop
[7379.80 → 7381.36] because they're only open on weekdays.
[7381.60 → 7382.02] So that...
[7382.02 → 7384.04] So I had a weekend, like, set aside to, like, do it.
[7384.30 → 7386.32] And then, like, I couldn't because I couldn't...
[7386.32 → 7387.66] I didn't have the paint I needed
[7387.66 → 7389.84] because a thing got messed up
[7389.84 → 7392.02] and I had to blast it again, sandblast it.
[7392.08 → 7393.02] Just, ah, it was horrible.
[7393.20 → 7395.04] You couldn't track my progress
[7395.04 → 7397.38] based on my save files in Final Fantasy VI.
[7398.40 → 7400.18] You can see, like, oh, it starts.
[7400.56 → 7401.82] And then I got to a point in the game
[7401.82 → 7404.42] that, like, I wasn't interested in
[7404.42 → 7406.88] and then kind of forgot to keep playing.
[7407.02 → 7408.74] And then a bunch of time goes by.
[7408.80 → 7411.44] And then, like, you probably remind me
[7411.44 → 7412.48] during WAN show or something.
[7412.58 → 7413.76] So there's, like, another little spurt.
[7414.10 → 7416.18] But I can tell based on the save file
[7416.18 → 7417.14] that I got to a point in the game
[7417.14 → 7418.84] that, again, just didn't interest me very much.
[7418.84 → 7420.08] And then I sort of forgot about it again.
[7420.28 → 7422.66] And then, like, the competition heated up
[7422.66 → 7423.50] and it's just like...
[7423.50 → 7426.72] Yeah, I should have been more stealthy
[7426.72 → 7428.18] about that I was working on it again
[7428.18 → 7429.40] because I think I could have won this.
[7429.78 → 7430.64] Maybe, yeah.
[7430.74 → 7434.64] If it wasn't for the long trip
[7434.64 → 7436.52] with those, like, insane boat rides and stuff.
[7436.62 → 7438.62] And then if it wasn't for getting sick.
[7439.18 → 7439.94] If I didn't...
[7439.94 → 7440.88] If I did the whole trip
[7440.88 → 7441.70] but didn't get sick,
[7441.74 → 7442.62] you still probably would have won.
[7443.88 → 7444.18] Yeah.
[7444.18 → 7445.80] I was just, like, stuck
[7445.80 → 7447.82] at home sick
[7447.82 → 7448.76] for a week.
[7449.16 → 7449.64] I was like, well,
[7449.96 → 7450.66] might as well finish the game.
[7452.24 → 7452.86] All right.
[7454.86 → 7455.96] What do you want to talk about next?
[7455.96 → 7456.68] How did we get there?
[7456.92 → 7457.38] I don't know.
[7457.42 → 7457.72] Who knows?
[7458.14 → 7458.50] Who cares?
[7459.20 → 7462.08] Android 16 is also getting a desktop mode.
[7463.00 → 7463.96] Oh, it's Samsung DEX.
[7464.54 → 7466.28] Oh, apparently they've worked closely with Samsung.
[7466.58 → 7467.26] Later this year.
[7467.66 → 7468.02] Okay.
[7468.34 → 7469.84] Google did state what he just said.
[7469.84 → 7471.12] This will give you the ability
[7471.12 → 7472.54] to move and resize multiple apps
[7472.54 → 7473.70] on Windows,
[7473.92 → 7474.74] just like a desktop.
[7475.26 → 7476.40] This will also be available
[7476.40 → 7477.68] to supported phones
[7477.68 → 7479.36] when connected to a dock
[7479.36 → 7480.26] or external display,
[7480.66 → 7482.78] possibly behind a developer option setting.
[7483.06 → 7483.46] Meanwhile,
[7483.80 → 7485.06] Graphene OS posted
[7485.06 → 7485.84] that they received information
[7486.40 → 7487.60] that AOSP,
[7487.74 → 7489.20] the Android open source project,
[7489.56 → 7490.84] could be discontinued.
[7492.12 → 7493.34] A screenshot of the claim
[7493.34 → 7494.48] is what looks like
[7494.48 → 7496.24] a Discord screenshot.
[7497.58 → 7498.58] I got it.
[7498.94 → 7499.46] Okay.
[7499.46 → 7499.80] Yeah.
[7500.58 → 7502.14] So them basically saying
[7502.14 → 7504.30] that they received said information.
[7507.28 → 7507.84] Yeah.
[7510.72 → 7512.92] We'll see if that's true or not.
[7514.52 → 7516.62] That would probably be bad.
[7519.68 → 7520.70] Their source stated
[7520.70 → 7522.28] that the first step would be
[7522.28 → 7523.52] Android 16 dropping,
[7523.74 → 7524.92] but like that's not...
[7524.92 → 7526.28] Dropping the Pixel repositories.
[7527.36 → 7528.80] Which appears to be what happened.
[7528.80 → 7530.00] No driver binaries
[7530.00 → 7531.60] available past Android 15.
[7532.18 → 7532.62] Ooh.
[7533.26 → 7534.64] The information has also been
[7534.64 → 7535.50] taken out of context,
[7535.66 → 7535.78] though,
[7535.82 → 7536.54] in numerous places.
[7536.86 → 7538.18] Here's a direct reply
[7538.18 → 7539.32] from Graphene OS on Reddit.
[7539.98 → 7541.52] This information doesn't come
[7541.52 → 7542.32] from Graphene OS.
[7542.54 → 7543.58] If you read the messages
[7543.58 → 7544.60] which are taken out of context,
[7544.60 → 7545.42] it states that we are
[7545.42 → 7546.38] relaying information
[7546.38 → 7548.38] someone else provided to us.
[7548.52 → 7548.62] Yeah.
[7550.68 → 7551.12] Cool.
[7551.48 → 7551.74] Well,
[7551.74 → 7552.36] not cool,
[7552.36 → 7553.32] but yeah.
[7553.74 → 7555.30] This certainly wouldn't help them
[7555.30 → 7556.10] in their current
[7556.10 → 7557.26] antitrust lawsuits.
[7557.52 → 7557.62] Yeah.
[7557.74 → 7558.62] That's a good point.
[7558.72 → 7560.30] And if Android did go closed source,
[7560.38 → 7561.78] it would likely make many projects
[7561.78 → 7562.72] much more difficult,
[7562.84 → 7563.68] if not impossible
[7563.68 → 7564.68] for outside companies,
[7564.90 → 7566.52] such as this Android phone
[7566.52 → 7567.66] that claims compatibility
[7567.66 → 7569.18] with the Apple Watch.
[7569.48 → 7570.00] What?
[7570.00 → 7573.86] This is the Vivo Fold 5.
[7574.04 → 7574.52] It's kind of cool.
[7575.68 → 7576.16] All right.
[7576.66 → 7577.02] Well,
[7577.30 → 7578.20] I hope not.
[7578.54 → 7580.30] Open source is definitely cool
[7580.30 → 7582.46] when our corporate overlords
[7582.46 → 7583.34] commit to it
[7583.34 → 7584.96] and contribute to it.
[7584.96 → 7586.00] And Google has,
[7586.54 → 7587.08] in some ways,
[7587.14 → 7588.24] been not great about it
[7588.24 → 7588.78] and in other ways
[7588.78 → 7589.92] been super amazing,
[7590.06 → 7590.28] awesome,
[7590.40 → 7590.58] great.
[7591.16 → 7593.04] And AOSP is one of the
[7593.04 → 7593.54] super amazing,
[7593.64 → 7593.82] awesome,
[7593.92 → 7594.80] great things that Google
[7594.80 → 7595.68] has done over the years.
[7597.82 → 7598.22] Yeah.
[7598.42 → 7598.96] Do you want to talk about
[7598.96 → 7600.90] the DOG Xbox Ally X?
[7601.22 → 7601.62] Yes.
[7602.10 → 7602.72] What a name.
[7603.08 → 7603.86] Did you watch the video?
[7606.10 → 7607.12] Yes, part of it.
[7609.42 → 7610.56] There was a...
[7610.56 → 7610.86] So,
[7610.98 → 7611.70] that's actually
[7611.70 → 7613.02] a fascinating answer
[7613.02 → 7614.74] because I'm sure
[7614.74 → 7615.70] if you were hyped,
[7616.06 → 7616.64] you would have watched
[7616.64 → 7617.20] the whole thing.
[7617.46 → 7617.72] Yes.
[7617.80 → 7617.96] So,
[7618.12 → 7619.28] I want your read
[7619.28 → 7620.62] on the hype level
[7620.62 → 7621.80] around this device.
[7622.72 → 7623.02] Or wait,
[7623.08 → 7623.36] you know what?
[7623.46 → 7623.72] Hold on.
[7623.80 → 7624.38] Hold that thought.
[7624.62 → 7625.68] Let's run through the details
[7625.68 → 7626.74] for anyone who didn't watch
[7626.74 → 7627.72] our video earlier this week.
[7627.72 → 7629.20] I went down to
[7629.20 → 7629.90] Activision HQ
[7629.90 → 7630.96] to check out
[7630.96 → 7631.72] the Xbox...
[7632.66 → 7632.90] Sorry,
[7632.98 → 7635.16] the DOG Xbox Ally X
[7635.16 → 7636.12] as well as the
[7636.12 → 7637.82] DOG Xbox Ally.
[7638.20 → 7638.90] There are two models,
[7639.14 → 7640.18] one with a Z2 Extreme
[7640.18 → 7640.76] which is a
[7640.76 → 7642.06] ballin' out of control
[7642.06 → 7642.96] Zen 5,
[7643.04 → 7643.86] Zen 5C,
[7644.38 → 7645.50] RDNA 3.5,
[7645.58 → 7647.06] 16CU processor.
[7647.26 → 7647.88] This thing is
[7647.88 → 7648.52] incredible.
[7649.06 → 7651.02] 24 gigs LP DDR5X memory,
[7651.24 → 7652.70] huge 80 watt-hour battery,
[7652.84 → 7653.74] one terabyte of storage.
[7653.74 → 7654.98] This thing looks like
[7654.98 → 7655.82] it'll be like
[7655.82 → 7656.98] the king of the handhelds
[7656.98 → 7657.64] once it comes out
[7657.64 → 7658.40] in terms of performance.
[7658.90 → 7659.90] And then also the Ally,
[7660.84 → 7664.16] which has the AMD Z2A processor,
[7664.70 → 7665.80] which I guess indicates
[7665.80 → 7666.80] that Asus learned
[7666.80 → 7668.04] absolutely nothing
[7668.04 → 7669.34] from their previous strategy
[7669.34 → 7670.74] of having the one
[7670.74 → 7672.06] that makes any sense to buy
[7672.06 → 7672.98] and the one that's
[7672.98 → 7673.92] almost as expensive
[7673.92 → 7674.84] but is dog shit
[7674.84 → 7675.56] for performance
[7675.56 → 7677.22] because this one
[7677.22 → 7678.60] seems to have about
[7678.60 → 7679.20] the performance
[7679.20 → 7680.70] of the Steam Deck
[7680.70 → 7681.80] but,
[7681.92 → 7682.82] which would be fine
[7682.82 → 7684.66] if it was $350
[7684.66 → 7685.64] or whatever
[7685.64 → 7688.60] but it isn't
[7688.60 → 7690.08] and it probably won't be
[7690.08 → 7691.58] or I shouldn't say it isn't,
[7691.64 → 7692.82] it probably won't be
[7692.82 → 7693.98] and yeah,
[7694.30 → 7694.52] cool,
[7694.62 → 7695.30] good luck with that.
[7696.08 → 7697.44] Both have a 7-inch
[7697.44 → 7700.04] 1080p 120Hz IPS display
[7700.04 → 7702.28] and both favour ergonomics
[7702.28 → 7703.36] over portability.
[7703.84 → 7704.90] They're not slim
[7704.90 → 7705.72] like the Switch 2
[7705.72 → 7706.46] but they have like,
[7706.56 → 7707.16] it feels more like
[7707.16 → 7707.90] having a controller
[7707.90 → 7708.48] in your hand.
[7709.20 → 7710.36] A major part
[7710.36 → 7711.16] of the announcement though,
[7711.86 → 7712.62] in my opinion,
[7712.86 → 7713.50] the announcement
[7713.50 → 7715.10] is the changes
[7715.10 → 7716.10] that the Xbox team
[7716.10 → 7717.00] has helped make
[7717.00 → 7717.68] to Windows
[7717.68 → 7720.40] to make this device tick.
[7720.60 → 7721.62] They claim to have cut
[7721.62 → 7722.70] at least 2 gigs
[7722.70 → 7723.46] of memory usage
[7723.46 → 7724.70] so far at idle,
[7725.18 → 7726.64] terminating useless processes
[7726.64 → 7727.44] and functionalities
[7727.44 → 7727.96] that aren't needed.
[7728.52 → 7730.24] They simply will not even
[7730.24 → 7731.74] render the desktop background
[7731.74 → 7733.18] if you are in the new
[7733.18 → 7735.14] Xbox designed interface
[7735.14 → 7736.32] that it will boot
[7736.32 → 7737.40] directly to.
[7737.40 → 7739.36] very cool stuff
[7739.36 → 7741.00] but it's going to need
[7741.00 → 7741.78] a lot more testing
[7741.78 → 7743.36] once the Xbox team
[7743.36 → 7744.30] has done a lot more
[7744.30 → 7745.14] refinement alongside
[7745.14 → 7745.86] the Windows team
[7745.86 → 7747.40] to get this software out
[7747.40 → 7748.40] and it looks like
[7748.40 → 7749.40] they're going to launch
[7749.40 → 7751.20] in tandem with each other
[7751.20 → 7752.22] and I think what they're saying
[7752.22 → 7753.82] is holiday of this year.
[7757.24 → 7758.64] Microsoft talks a lot
[7758.64 → 7760.02] about how it's an Xbox.
[7760.02 → 7762.74] You can stream your Xbox games,
[7762.82 → 7764.10] you can play Game Pass games,
[7764.20 → 7765.68] you can play your PC games.
[7767.84 → 7769.46] What they haven't really addressed
[7769.46 → 7770.42] is what this means
[7770.42 → 7771.88] for the Xbox games
[7771.88 → 7772.88] that do not come
[7772.88 → 7774.06] with a PC license.
[7774.70 → 7775.54] Will this Xbox
[7775.54 → 7777.48] play an Xbox game
[7777.48 → 7779.28] unless you stream it
[7779.28 → 7779.80] from an Xbox?
[7780.16 → 7780.90] So far,
[7781.02 → 7782.10] I don't think I've seen
[7782.10 → 7783.34] an indication that it will
[7783.34 → 7785.16] so that's a major question mark
[7785.16 → 7786.16] that people have around it
[7786.16 → 7787.18] and of course the other one
[7787.18 → 7788.38] is the price.
[7788.86 → 7789.92] So with all of that
[7789.92 → 7790.88] caught up,
[7791.26 → 7792.74] your thoughts, sir?
[7792.90 → 7795.06] I think I was kind of disappointed
[7795.06 → 7797.48] because Xbox didn't have
[7797.48 → 7798.26] the Jones
[7798.26 → 7800.86] to just actually make this
[7800.86 → 7801.62] an Xbox.
[7803.20 → 7804.68] They should have just gone Nintendo
[7804.68 → 7807.92] and made like a sick dock for it
[7807.92 → 7809.88] and just this is
[7809.88 → 7811.00] the next Xbox.
[7812.12 → 7813.38] And sure, whatever.
[7813.60 → 7814.56] We did it in collaboration
[7814.56 → 7816.16] with DOG.
[7816.16 → 7817.60] How would that work though?
[7819.30 → 7819.94] Because like...
[7819.94 → 7820.62] So that the dock
[7820.62 → 7821.50] is a disk drive.
[7821.78 → 7822.66] No, I don't mean that.
[7822.72 → 7824.16] I just mean like the very...
[7827.24 → 7830.16] The entire game development pipeline
[7830.92 → 7833.36] is for console
[7833.36 → 7835.24] is just built different.
[7836.28 → 7839.20] And like I don't think
[7839.20 → 7840.36] Rockstar is going to pivot
[7840.36 → 7842.62] and have GTA 6 ready
[7842.62 → 7843.96] at launch
[7843.96 → 7845.04] for Windows
[7845.04 → 7846.08] just because Microsoft
[7846.08 → 7846.94] came out and is like
[7846.94 → 7848.56] yeah, it's an Xbox.
[7849.22 → 7850.42] By the way, it runs Windows.
[7851.46 → 7853.04] So how does that work then?
[7854.14 → 7855.08] Because if you came out
[7855.08 → 7856.10] with a handheld PC
[7856.10 → 7858.10] that doesn't run Windows games
[7858.10 → 7860.04] they would have been crucified.
[7861.78 → 7863.44] So there are things that make it
[7863.44 → 7864.56] not an Xbox
[7864.56 → 7866.08] like the fact that it isn't an Xbox.
[7866.34 → 7866.92] It would have been cool
[7866.92 → 7869.66] if the gaming mode
[7869.66 → 7870.98] was essentially
[7870.98 → 7872.04] it being an Xbox.
[7874.12 → 7875.04] There isn't really
[7875.04 → 7876.38] hardware differences these days.
[7876.46 → 7877.52] They're just computers.
[7878.78 → 7879.94] Okay, counterpoint.
[7880.66 → 7881.82] The gaming mode
[7881.82 → 7885.42] would only be able to be
[7885.42 → 7886.96] an Xbox gaming mode
[7886.96 → 7888.88] if they had
[7888.88 → 7889.90] all the way to
[7889.90 → 7891.28] a firmware level
[7891.28 → 7893.12] like DRM
[7893.12 → 7894.78] locks, locks down,
[7894.90 → 7896.16] lockdowns, locks down,
[7896.26 → 7896.48] whatever.
[7896.48 → 7897.78] You could like boot into it
[7897.78 → 7898.08] I guess.
[7898.32 → 7898.66] Unless they
[7898.66 → 7899.84] ah, yeah, but that's
[7899.84 → 7901.02] so clunky.
[7901.14 → 7901.86] That does kind of suck.
[7901.94 → 7903.22] That is super clunky.
[7903.62 → 7905.18] And realistically
[7905.18 → 7906.40] let me make
[7906.40 → 7907.26] let me make the argument
[7907.26 → 7908.14] for why I think
[7908.14 → 7908.96] that would be worse
[7908.96 → 7910.44] because
[7910.44 → 7912.54] I believe
[7912.54 → 7913.52] that the Ally
[7913.52 → 7914.40] Xbox
[7914.40 → 7915.24] DOG
[7915.24 → 7915.70] X
[7915.70 → 7916.48] Ally X
[7916.48 → 7916.84] whatever
[7916.84 → 7918.28] this device
[7918.28 → 7919.52] the device that I was holding
[7919.52 → 7920.92] is utterly
[7920.92 → 7922.20] f***ING irrelevant
[7922.20 → 7924.28] from Microsoft's perspective.
[7924.28 → 7925.32] Yeah.
[7925.78 → 7926.40] It is
[7926.40 → 7927.62] it is simply
[7927.62 → 7928.68] the
[7928.68 → 7930.54] launch platform
[7930.54 → 7931.16] slash
[7931.16 → 7932.40] like a
[7932.40 → 7933.76] showcase vehicle
[7933.76 → 7935.14] for the changes
[7935.14 → 7935.68] that Microsoft
[7935.68 → 7936.30] is making
[7936.30 → 7937.50] fundamentally to Windows
[7937.50 → 7938.36] to make it a more
[7938.36 → 7940.06] efficient gaming platform.
[7940.88 → 7942.00] And so with that in mind
[7942.00 → 7943.42] I think that the
[7943.42 → 7944.46] Xbox branding
[7944.46 → 7945.44] is a little curious
[7945.44 → 7946.96] like
[7946.96 → 7947.74] other than
[7947.74 → 7948.30] you know
[7948.30 → 7948.98] I can understand
[7948.98 → 7950.04] why the Xbox team
[7950.04 → 7951.00] wants some credit
[7951.00 → 7951.62] for coming in
[7951.62 → 7952.32] and cleaning up
[7952.32 → 7953.50] the Windows team's mess
[7953.50 → 7957.00] but really
[7957.00 → 7957.76] what launched
[7957.76 → 7959.24] is Windows
[7959.24 → 7960.04] getting more efficient.
[7961.12 → 7961.28] Yeah.
[7961.64 → 7962.44] That part was cool.
[7962.68 → 7963.86] Which is super exciting
[7963.86 → 7964.44] to me
[7964.44 → 7965.56] not because I want to
[7965.56 → 7966.30] buy an Xbox
[7966.30 → 7966.92] DOG
[7966.92 → 7967.50] X Ally
[7967.50 → 7968.60] X DOG
[7968.60 → 7969.14] whatever
[7969.14 → 7970.36] but because
[7970.36 → 7971.24] I want
[7971.24 → 7972.72] every other handhold
[7972.72 → 7973.46] that exists
[7973.46 → 7974.68] to be able to
[7974.68 → 7975.10] access
[7975.10 → 7976.78] the unfettered
[7976.78 → 7977.78] game compatibility
[7977.78 → 7978.64] of Windows
[7978.64 → 7980.06] on the go.
[7980.72 → 7981.22] I also
[7981.22 → 7982.72] think I didn't
[7982.72 → 7983.18] end up watching
[7983.18 → 7983.70] the whole thing
[7983.70 → 7984.54] because I got
[7984.54 → 7985.26] distracted by
[7985.26 → 7986.20] some profoundly
[7986.20 → 7987.14] dumb comments.
[7987.84 → 7988.66] Oh really?
[7988.76 → 7989.26] I'm not going to
[7989.26 → 7989.82] single them out
[7989.82 → 7990.18] because I don't even
[7990.18 → 7990.80] want to give them
[7990.80 → 7991.76] the like attention
[7991.76 → 7993.78] but just like
[7993.78 → 7994.78] whoa
[7994.78 → 7997.18] genuinely
[7997.18 → 7998.20] unintelligent
[7998.20 → 7999.08] and like there was
[7999.08 → 7999.96] people responding
[7999.96 → 8000.40] to them
[8000.40 → 8001.14] being like
[8001.14 → 8001.74] um
[8001.74 → 8003.64] here are some
[8003.64 → 8004.16] corrections
[8004.16 → 8005.44] which
[8005.44 → 8006.54] felt a little
[8006.54 → 8006.90] better.
[8007.94 → 8008.80] Oh okay.
[8009.32 → 8009.94] That's funny
[8009.94 → 8010.46] because I
[8010.46 → 8011.28] actually read
[8011.28 → 8011.68] through a lot
[8011.68 → 8012.16] of the comments
[8012.16 → 8012.52] and I
[8012.52 → 8013.02] I like
[8013.02 → 8013.44] shadow-banned
[8013.44 → 8013.80] a bunch of
[8013.80 → 8014.32] people on that
[8014.32 → 8014.52] one.
[8014.64 → 8014.92] Oh it might
[8014.92 → 8015.30] be gone.
[8015.70 → 8016.12] Okay because
[8016.12 → 8016.62] there were a lot
[8016.62 → 8017.62] I jumped in early.
[8018.00 → 8018.82] Okay there were a lot
[8018.82 → 8019.42] that were just like
[8019.42 → 8020.16] this is obviously
[8020.16 → 8020.96] paid and stuff
[8020.96 → 8021.48] like that like
[8021.48 → 8022.04] all those people
[8022.04 → 8022.36] are just
[8022.36 → 8022.86] permabanned.
[8022.98 → 8023.42] Yeah I know
[8023.42 → 8024.18] it was like
[8024.18 → 8024.70] we disclose
[8024.70 → 8025.08] our paid
[8025.08 → 8025.80] sponsorships
[8025.80 → 8026.30] um
[8026.30 → 8027.80] yeah
[8027.80 → 8029.24] so anything
[8029.24 → 8030.42] that's just like
[8030.42 → 8030.90] completely
[8030.90 → 8031.52] false.
[8031.52 → 8031.82] Actually no
[8031.82 → 8032.62] the main one
[8032.62 → 8033.14] I'm thinking of
[8033.14 → 8034.20] did say something
[8034.20 → 8034.94] like that near the
[8034.94 → 8035.46] end of it
[8035.46 → 8036.72] so it might even
[8036.72 → 8037.44] just be gone now.
[8037.60 → 8037.88] I don't know
[8037.88 → 8038.60] I also think you
[8038.60 → 8039.36] get a bit of a
[8039.36 → 8040.10] different crowd
[8040.10 → 8041.24] when we're talking
[8041.24 → 8041.76] about Xbox
[8041.76 → 8042.92] or when we're
[8042.92 → 8043.56] talking about
[8043.56 → 8044.02] Apple
[8044.02 → 8044.38] or when we're
[8044.38 → 8044.72] talking about
[8044.72 → 8045.10] Nintendo
[8045.10 → 8046.02] like that's
[8046.02 → 8046.44] something that
[8046.44 → 8047.24] I've really had
[8047.24 → 8047.88] a hard time
[8047.88 → 8048.48] kind of coming
[8048.48 → 8049.26] to grips with
[8049.26 → 8049.90] is that depending
[8049.90 → 8050.90] on what video
[8050.90 → 8051.38] we make
[8051.38 → 8052.42] there's so much
[8052.42 → 8053.38] variety across
[8053.38 → 8053.92] our channel
[8053.92 → 8055.42] that we can be
[8055.42 → 8056.24] engaging with
[8056.24 → 8057.36] a small core
[8057.36 → 8057.80] audience
[8057.80 → 8059.58] but outside
[8059.58 → 8060.16] of that
[8060.16 → 8061.52] a completely
[8061.52 → 8063.00] different audience
[8063.00 → 8063.84] from one video
[8063.84 → 8064.36] to the next
[8064.36 → 8065.24] that has no
[8065.24 → 8066.00] interest in the
[8066.00 → 8066.94] other in the
[8066.94 → 8067.36] other topic
[8067.36 → 8067.94] and console
[8067.94 → 8068.88] fanboys are like
[8068.88 → 8069.90] absolutely still
[8069.90 → 8070.26] a thing
[8070.26 → 8072.28] and absolutely
[8072.28 → 8072.80] brain-dead
[8072.80 → 8073.56] oh yeah
[8073.56 → 8074.92] like it's
[8074.92 → 8075.94] it's
[8075.94 → 8077.80] I don't
[8077.80 → 8078.56] I'm sorry
[8078.56 → 8079.12] I just I don't
[8079.12 → 8079.66] have another
[8079.66 → 8080.52] I don't have a
[8080.52 → 8081.52] retraction for you
[8081.52 → 8082.24] like if you're
[8082.24 → 8083.12] upset by the
[8083.12 → 8083.54] thing I just
[8083.54 → 8083.80] said
[8083.80 → 8086.86] like being
[8086.86 → 8087.68] that emotionally
[8087.68 → 8088.68] invested in
[8088.68 → 8089.26] like a game
[8089.26 → 8090.10] machine to
[8090.10 → 8090.60] play video
[8090.60 → 8091.56] games I'm
[8091.56 → 8092.10] sorry I just
[8092.10 → 8092.88] I just can't
[8092.88 → 8093.54] you can you
[8093.54 → 8094.10] can love the
[8094.10 → 8094.92] art you know
[8094.92 → 8095.56] of the games
[8095.56 → 8096.22] that you play
[8096.22 → 8096.96] on it or
[8096.96 → 8098.06] whatever but
[8098.06 → 8099.34] to to to
[8099.34 → 8100.26] be like
[8100.26 → 8101.78] angry about
[8101.78 → 8102.88] that people
[8102.88 → 8103.70] choose the
[8103.70 → 8104.18] other one
[8104.18 → 8104.96] I kind of
[8104.96 → 8105.56] understood
[8105.56 → 8107.46] back in
[8107.46 → 8108.96] like especially
[8108.96 → 8109.76] high school
[8109.76 → 8110.30] when like the
[8110.30 → 8111.02] console purchasing
[8111.02 → 8111.72] decisions weren't
[8111.72 → 8112.38] even so much
[8112.38 → 8113.08] the kids
[8113.08 → 8114.02] options
[8114.02 → 8115.26] when it
[8115.26 → 8115.52] would be
[8115.52 → 8116.46] like frustrating
[8116.46 → 8117.78] when like
[8117.78 → 8118.46] most of your
[8118.46 → 8118.86] friends would
[8118.86 → 8119.38] get one
[8119.38 → 8120.96] and then it's
[8120.96 → 8121.68] like well I
[8121.68 → 8122.16] guess we just
[8122.16 → 8123.12] can't play with
[8123.12 → 8124.04] so-and-so
[8124.04 → 8124.68] but now there's
[8124.68 → 8125.30] cross-play
[8125.30 → 8126.76] yeah so I guess
[8126.76 → 8127.28] it's not as big
[8127.28 → 8127.66] of a thing
[8127.66 → 8128.04] anymore
[8128.04 → 8128.78] so few
[8128.78 → 8129.46] exclusives that
[8129.46 → 8130.06] matter especially
[8130.06 → 8130.70] for multiplayer
[8130.70 → 8132.26] yeah now that
[8132.26 → 8132.74] they just got to
[8132.74 → 8133.34] optimize that
[8133.34 → 8134.04] loot box revenue
[8134.04 → 8134.90] yep
[8134.90 → 8138.98] anyway
[8138.98 → 8139.86] so dry
[8139.86 → 8141.02] so awful
[8141.02 → 8142.02] that I just
[8142.02 → 8143.04] wanted something
[8143.04 → 8145.08] uh what else
[8145.08 → 8145.70] we got here
[8145.70 → 8146.16] I should start
[8146.16 → 8146.98] minimizing topics
[8146.98 → 8147.36] some of these
[8147.36 → 8148.20] are thick
[8148.20 → 8149.48] um
[8149.48 → 8151.02] oh I've been
[8151.02 → 8151.52] minimizing the
[8151.52 → 8151.92] ones we're done
[8151.92 → 8153.30] oh
[8153.30 → 8154.12] some
[8154.12 → 8155.58] some benchmarks
[8155.58 → 8156.76] surfaced for the
[8156.76 → 8158.12] NVIDIA n1x
[8158.12 → 8158.76] yes
[8158.76 → 8159.96] NVIDIA's long
[8159.96 → 8161.46] rumoured arm CPU
[8161.46 → 8162.94] was a no-show
[8162.94 → 8163.90] at computer this
[8163.90 → 8164.06] year
[8164.06 → 8164.56] yeah
[8164.56 → 8165.62] but has shown
[8165.62 → 8166.38] up in a geek
[8166.38 → 8166.94] bench 6
[8166.94 → 8167.64] benchmark
[8167.64 → 8169.10] the geek bench
[8169.10 → 8169.92] results provided
[8169.92 → 8171.42] this information
[8171.42 → 8173.14] NVIDIA n1x
[8173.14 → 8174.28] that's probably
[8174.28 → 8175.30] likely a code name
[8175.30 → 8176.36] very unlikely to be
[8176.36 → 8176.98] the actual brand
[8176.98 → 8177.24] name
[8177.24 → 8178.08] Linux
[8178.08 → 8179.86] 20 core arm
[8179.86 → 8180.56] CPU base
[8180.56 → 8181.66] frequency of 2.81
[8181.66 → 8182.62] gigahertz boost
[8182.62 → 8183.42] of 4.05
[8183.42 → 8184.76] the test was run
[8184.76 → 8185.82] on an unreleased
[8185.82 → 8186.98] hp workstation
[8186.98 → 8187.76] running Ubuntu
[8187.76 → 8189.90] with 120 gigabytes
[8189.90 → 8190.64] of memory
[8190.64 → 8193.26] uh video cards
[8193.26 → 8194.40] speculates that
[8194.40 → 8195.78] this is 128 gigs
[8195.78 → 8196.30] of memory with
[8196.30 → 8196.92] eight reserved
[8196.92 → 8198.06] for the GPU
[8198.06 → 8199.38] they created a
[8199.38 → 8200.18] helpful table of
[8200.18 → 8200.98] other CPUs
[8200.98 → 8202.46] to compare the
[8202.46 → 8203.48] geek bench 5
[8203.48 → 8204.24] results
[8204.24 → 8207.18] so here's our
[8207.18 → 8207.68] single threaded
[8207.68 → 8208.56] and multithreaded
[8208.56 → 8209.04] scores
[8209.04 → 8210.22] with the NVIDIA
[8210.22 → 8211.54] processor looking
[8211.54 → 8213.56] pretty solidly
[8213.56 → 8214.12] okay
[8214.12 → 8215.14] it's up there
[8215.14 → 8215.92] it's she's
[8215.92 → 8216.82] she's up there
[8216.82 → 8218.00] she's up there
[8218.00 → 8218.86] she's no apple
[8218.86 → 8219.74] she's no apple
[8219.74 → 8220.66] m4 max but
[8220.66 → 8221.14] uh
[8221.14 → 8222.26] she's yeah
[8222.26 → 8223.42] not, not irrelevant
[8223.42 → 8225.00] uh video cards
[8225.00 → 8226.40] also noted that
[8226.40 → 8226.98] this configuration
[8226.98 → 8227.72] is very similar
[8227.72 → 8228.52] to NVIDIA's
[8228.52 → 8229.80] gb10 super chip
[8229.80 → 8230.50] for their AI
[8230.50 → 8231.28] mini pc
[8231.28 → 8232.14] uh
[8232.14 → 8232.84] yes
[8232.84 → 8236.92] um
[8236.92 → 8238.02] discussion question
[8238.02 → 8238.78] is why is NVIDIA
[8238.78 → 8240.12] investing in arm
[8240.12 → 8240.84] instead of something
[8240.84 → 8241.50] open source like
[8241.50 → 8242.02] risk 5
[8242.02 → 8243.10] because risk
[8243.10 → 8243.72] I'm sure
[8243.72 → 8244.30] that they are
[8244.30 → 8245.02] investing heavily
[8245.02 → 8245.72] in risk 5
[8245.72 → 8246.40] it's just
[8246.40 → 8247.36] it's not ready
[8247.36 → 8247.60] yet
[8247.60 → 8247.90] like
[8247.90 → 8249.86] even just getting
[8249.86 → 8250.56] windows running
[8250.56 → 8251.78] on an arm chip
[8251.78 → 8252.46] that isn't like
[8252.46 → 8253.14] the one
[8253.14 → 8253.84] that
[8253.84 → 8254.98] you know
[8254.98 → 8255.68] Qualcomm put all
[8255.68 → 8256.38] the work into
[8256.38 → 8257.16] for drivers
[8257.16 → 8258.00] and compatibility
[8258.00 → 8258.56] and everything
[8258.56 → 8258.90] is
[8258.90 → 8260.06] is not a given
[8260.06 → 8261.12] um
[8261.12 → 8262.62] risk 5
[8262.62 → 8263.58] is so far
[8263.58 → 8263.84] away
[8263.84 → 8264.62] and like it or
[8264.62 → 8265.10] not windows
[8265.10 → 8266.16] is a thing
[8266.16 → 8266.92] that you just
[8266.92 → 8267.52] kind of have to
[8267.52 → 8268.20] contend with
[8268.20 → 8269.12] so NVIDIA going
[8269.12 → 8270.14] arm means that
[8270.14 → 8271.18] mainstream adoption
[8271.18 → 8272.24] could be possible
[8272.24 → 8272.86] for this thing
[8272.86 → 8274.94] is my theory
[8274.94 → 8278.44] VGA motherboards
[8278.44 → 8279.00] are having trouble
[8279.00 → 8280.42] with RTX 50 series
[8280.42 → 8281.00] GPUs
[8281.00 → 8282.64] this um
[8282.64 → 8283.40] there's a
[8283.40 → 8283.86] basically
[8283.86 → 8285.02] something
[8285.02 → 8286.28] SM bus communication
[8286.28 → 8287.48] pins and
[8287.48 → 8288.46] something
[8288.46 → 8290.20] no official fix
[8290.20 → 8291.02] from VGA
[8291.02 → 8291.84] but what you can
[8291.84 → 8292.54] do to fix it
[8292.54 → 8293.72] is you can cover
[8293.72 → 8294.88] the two SM bus pins
[8294.88 → 8295.66] pin 5 and 6
[8295.66 → 8296.48] of the PCI connector
[8296.48 → 8297.60] with some canton tape
[8297.60 → 8299.00] uh the mod does not
[8299.00 → 8299.70] impede the performance
[8299.70 → 8300.28] of the GPU
[8300.28 → 8301.02] so I just wanted to
[8301.02 → 8301.60] get this out there
[8301.60 → 8302.26] as a PSA
[8302.26 → 8303.36] and also
[8303.36 → 8305.30] a reminder that
[8305.30 → 8306.42] buying a niche
[8306.42 → 8307.44] motherboard is almost
[8307.44 → 8308.38] never a good idea
[8308.38 → 8309.68] even from a major brand
[8309.68 → 8312.20] i i I just have
[8312.20 → 8313.04] been burned
[8313.04 → 8314.12] time and time again
[8314.12 → 8314.56] oh yeah
[8314.56 → 8315.64] choosing anything
[8315.64 → 8316.44] other than like
[8316.44 → 8317.26] that one
[8317.26 → 8318.54] you know that one
[8318.54 → 8319.22] of the like
[8319.22 → 8320.64] handful of
[8320.64 → 8321.26] three or four
[8321.26 → 8321.90] different models
[8321.90 → 8322.64] per generation
[8322.64 → 8323.30] per brand
[8323.30 → 8324.08] that actually
[8324.08 → 8324.74] sells a ton of
[8324.74 → 8325.46] units because
[8325.46 → 8327.22] i I learned that
[8327.22 → 8328.16] lesson after working
[8328.16 → 8328.80] here for a bit
[8328.80 → 8330.38] because growing up
[8330.38 → 8331.24] you know
[8331.24 → 8332.00] motherboards were
[8332.00 → 8333.46] never the most
[8333.46 → 8334.22] interesting thing
[8334.22 → 8335.04] ever so I got
[8335.04 → 8335.72] kind of the thing
[8335.72 → 8336.30] that would work
[8336.30 → 8337.14] which was often
[8337.14 → 8337.86] very popular
[8337.86 → 8339.04] um and then
[8339.04 → 8339.88] coming here I had
[8339.88 → 8340.94] access to really
[8340.94 → 8341.84] nice fancy motherboards
[8341.84 → 8342.38] and I got all kind
[8342.38 → 8342.92] of excited and
[8342.92 → 8343.48] started using them
[8343.48 → 8344.00] and it was kind
[8344.00 → 8344.74] of a pain
[8344.74 → 8347.56] yeah just going
[8347.56 → 8348.16] with the mainstream
[8348.16 → 8349.32] thing works really
[8349.32 → 8350.00] well when it comes
[8350.00 → 8350.50] to motherboards
[8350.50 → 8351.24] because they're
[8351.24 → 8351.94] they're going to have
[8351.94 → 8353.02] far more customers
[8353.02 → 8353.80] yelling at them
[8353.80 → 8354.58] about issues
[8354.58 → 8355.90] and they're far
[8355.90 → 8356.74] more likely to
[8356.74 → 8357.52] get found
[8357.52 → 8358.46] like edge cases
[8358.46 → 8359.18] are far more likely
[8359.18 → 8359.74] to be found
[8359.74 → 8360.52] and far more likely
[8360.52 → 8361.06] to be fixed
[8361.06 → 8364.00] and finally glorious
[8364.00 → 8364.86] is new mouse is
[8364.86 → 8365.30] out of stock
[8365.30 → 8366.56] or sorry is out
[8366.56 → 8367.54] is released
[8367.54 → 8368.84] everywhere except
[8368.84 → 8370.08] their own country
[8370.08 → 8371.18] the U.S.
[8371.24 → 8371.76] peripheral makers
[8371.76 → 8372.86] new lightweight
[8372.86 → 8373.58] entry-level gaming
[8373.58 → 8374.30] mouse the glorious
[8374.30 → 8375.22] model o eternal
[8375.22 → 8376.82] is now released
[8376.82 → 8377.84] everywhere except
[8377.84 → 8378.60] the U.S.
[8379.00 → 8380.54] due to ongoing
[8380.54 → 8381.96] global supply chain
[8381.96 → 8382.50] issues
[8382.50 → 8384.44] pc gamers Jeremy
[8384.44 → 8385.60] laird speculates
[8385.60 → 8386.32] that the real reason
[8386.32 → 8386.78] the mouse isn't
[8386.78 → 8387.62] available is tariff
[8387.62 → 8388.92] uncertainty and that
[8388.92 → 8389.80] Texas-based glorious
[8389.80 → 8390.94] doesn't want to call
[8390.94 → 8392.02] out the current
[8392.02 → 8392.94] administration
[8392.94 → 8394.84] well in their
[8394.84 → 8396.00] defence tariff
[8396.00 → 8396.82] uncertainty has
[8396.82 → 8398.30] created global
[8398.30 → 8399.20] supply chain issues
[8399.20 → 8401.34] so they are kind
[8401.34 → 8401.96] of just saying the
[8401.96 → 8402.62] thing further down
[8402.62 → 8403.02] the line
[8403.02 → 8403.90] that was all i just
[8403.90 → 8404.40] thought it was funny
[8404.40 → 8406.04] yeah we've been
[8406.04 → 8406.80] dealing with it too
[8406.80 → 8407.58] and it has sucked
[8407.58 → 8408.36] and it's not funny
[8408.36 → 8410.16] everyone has but
[8410.16 → 8411.88] commiserating is funny
[8411.88 → 8413.94] yeah sure yeah
[8413.94 → 8415.88] all right it's time
[8415.88 → 8416.70] for after dark let's
[8416.70 → 8418.46] do it yeah wow
[8418.46 → 8419.54] so fast
[8419.54 → 8421.58] so swift
[8421.58 → 8424.28] sometimes
[8424.28 → 8426.80] I see it coming
[8426.80 → 8428.92] no
[8428.92 → 8433.84] okay merch messages
[8433.84 → 8435.70] hey Linus
[8435.70 → 8436.96] how are the LTT cables
[8436.96 → 8437.48] coming along
[8437.48 → 8438.52] I recently had to
[8438.52 → 8439.30] purchase a lot of
[8439.30 → 8440.58] cables for my level
[8440.58 → 8441.98] one TeX KVM switch
[8441.98 → 8443.72] and was annoyed that
[8443.72 → 8444.68] many cables are low
[8444.68 → 8445.98] quality and I don't
[8445.98 → 8446.78] have proper labelling
[8446.78 → 8448.84] they are coming
[8448.84 → 8450.22] along very well
[8450.22 → 8451.26] I believe our
[8451.26 → 8453.30] first order is in
[8453.30 → 8455.42] production I want to
[8455.42 → 8456.16] say in our second
[8456.16 → 8457.16] order we are working
[8457.16 → 8457.86] on even though we
[8457.86 → 8458.90] haven't actually gotten
[8458.90 → 8459.74] our first order yet
[8459.74 → 8460.50] because I'm pretty
[8460.50 → 8461.06] bullish on this
[8461.06 → 8464.62] product but transit
[8464.62 → 8466.34] times are tough and
[8466.34 → 8467.14] go to market is
[8467.14 → 8468.32] complicated by the
[8468.32 → 8470.08] tariff situation the
[8470.08 → 8471.10] company we're engaging
[8471.10 → 8472.12] with to get them
[8472.12 → 8473.48] made is and
[8473.48 → 8475.18] like work on the
[8475.18 → 8476.24] quality and design
[8476.24 → 8477.84] side of it is not
[8477.84 → 8479.36] Chinese based but the
[8479.36 → 8480.62] production is in China
[8480.62 → 8484.66] so yeah TBD I guess
[8484.66 → 8486.14] problematic TBD
[8486.14 → 8488.96] Linus will you be
[8488.96 → 8489.68] watching the new
[8489.68 → 8490.62] train your dragon movie
[8490.62 → 8491.84] in theatres or will
[8491.84 → 8492.82] you prefer to stay
[8492.82 → 8493.16] home
[8493.16 → 8500.66] I usually do not like
[8500.66 → 8502.22] read reviews of a movie
[8502.22 → 8503.34] that I like know I'm
[8503.34 → 8504.54] going to see and how to
[8504.54 → 8505.36] train your dragon given
[8505.36 → 8506.28] that the first one is
[8506.28 → 8508.24] quite literally in my
[8508.24 → 8509.22] like top three of
[8509.22 → 8511.02] beloved movies i
[8511.02 → 8511.62] wouldn't even say
[8511.62 → 8513.18] favourite you know but
[8513.18 → 8514.58] like beloved very
[8514.58 → 8515.52] beloved for me
[8515.52 → 8518.64] um it seems like a
[8518.64 → 8519.38] no-brainer that i
[8519.38 → 8521.22] would go but i kind
[8521.22 → 8521.92] of wanted to know
[8521.92 → 8522.80] how badly they
[8522.80 → 8523.78] massacred my boy
[8523.78 → 8525.40] before I go
[8525.40 → 8527.04] apparently they
[8527.04 → 8527.88] brought back the
[8527.88 → 8529.50] original composer
[8529.50 → 8531.68] which matters a lot
[8531.68 → 8533.38] to me because john
[8533.38 → 8534.76] Powell is goaded
[8534.76 → 8537.60] um they brought back
[8537.60 → 8538.84] Gerard Butler as
[8538.84 → 8540.08] Stoic which is
[8540.08 → 8541.48] pretty cool so
[8541.48 → 8542.20] literally the voice
[8542.20 → 8543.16] actor from the
[8543.16 → 8544.60] animated movies is
[8544.60 → 8545.86] he's back
[8545.86 → 8552.36] um so far what
[8552.36 → 8553.44] I've read seems to
[8553.44 → 8555.24] be that it is a
[8555.24 → 8556.38] fairly faithful
[8556.38 → 8558.06] adaptation but is
[8558.06 → 8559.62] not doesn't have a
[8559.62 → 8560.76] lot of soul
[8560.76 → 8563.78] um is it a live
[8563.78 → 8565.10] action yeah it's a
[8565.10 → 8566.08] live action remake of
[8566.08 → 8567.02] a movie from only 15
[8567.02 → 8567.50] years ago
[8567.50 → 8569.54] I personally believe
[8569.54 → 8570.64] that about all live
[8570.64 → 8571.64] action remakes
[8571.64 → 8573.16] honestly just
[8573.16 → 8573.94] automatically
[8573.94 → 8574.84] honestly what i
[8574.84 → 8575.54] would have been more
[8575.54 → 8576.86] likely to go see
[8576.86 → 8578.38] is a remaster
[8578.38 → 8582.28] that's interesting
[8582.28 → 8583.08] is that really
[8583.08 → 8585.48] because the first
[8585.48 → 8587.70] one was it
[8587.70 → 8589.46] wasn't quite CGI
[8589.46 → 8590.66] hadn't gotten
[8590.66 → 8592.04] or not CGI rather
[8592.04 → 8593.06] computer animation in
[8593.06 → 8593.64] this case I guess
[8593.64 → 8595.08] hadn't really gotten
[8595.08 → 8596.06] like good
[8596.06 → 8597.40] yeah the lighting
[8597.40 → 8599.10] the lighting sucks
[8599.10 → 8600.12] and the textures are
[8600.12 → 8601.66] noticeably low quality
[8601.66 → 8602.12] and stuff
[8602.12 → 8604.84] um whereas by the
[8604.84 → 8605.86] second and especially
[8605.86 → 8607.00] the third like they're
[8607.00 → 8608.26] beautiful films
[8608.26 → 8609.42] uh whereas the first
[8609.42 → 8610.96] one is pretty ugly by
[8610.96 → 8611.72] modern standards
[8611.72 → 8613.46] i I would have been
[8613.46 → 8615.28] way more likely to
[8615.28 → 8617.08] just go see a
[8617.08 → 8618.26] reanimation of the
[8618.26 → 8618.70] first one
[8618.70 → 8621.20] um but the problem
[8621.20 → 8622.56] with that strategy
[8622.56 → 8623.76] you know money making
[8623.76 → 8624.82] wise for DreamWorks
[8624.82 → 8626.30] is that then there
[8626.30 → 8627.46] have been no reason
[8627.46 → 8628.02] to remake
[8628.02 → 8629.14] to like to remaster
[8629.14 → 8629.64] two and three
[8629.64 → 8630.04] because they're
[8630.04 → 8631.34] already like good
[8631.34 → 8632.94] enough um I mean
[8632.94 → 8633.60] the standards I guess
[8633.60 → 8634.30] will change or
[8634.30 → 8635.96] whatever but i
[8635.96 → 8636.30] don't know
[8636.30 → 8638.16] like you go back
[8638.16 → 8639.08] and watch Toy Story
[8639.08 → 8640.36] one, and it's like
[8640.36 → 8641.02] yikes
[8641.02 → 8642.08] then you watch toy
[8642.08 → 8642.80] story two, and it's
[8642.80 → 8643.32] like yeah that could
[8643.32 → 8644.66] be better but you
[8644.66 → 8645.58] know it's like fine i
[8645.58 → 8647.08] guess you know there
[8647.08 → 8648.08] was there was a there
[8648.08 → 8648.92] was a threshold that
[8648.92 → 8649.82] was crossed like I can
[8649.82 → 8650.86] watch monsters inc and
[8650.86 → 8652.40] I'm like that's okay
[8652.40 → 8653.80] all right wait no, no
[8653.80 → 8654.54] not monsters inc like
[8654.54 → 8655.92] monsters you monsters
[8655.92 → 8657.56] you still look great
[8657.56 → 8659.14] that was I believe the
[8659.14 → 8660.74] first animated film that
[8660.74 → 8662.66] had like a really solid
[8662.66 → 8663.52] solution for global
[8663.52 → 8664.78] illumination is that
[8664.78 → 8665.50] right Dan it seems like
[8665.50 → 8666.08] the kind of thing you
[8666.08 → 8666.62] wouldn't know
[8666.62 → 8668.42] I'm sorry I was reading
[8668.42 → 8669.68] something else monster
[8669.68 → 8670.78] monsters you was that
[8670.78 → 8671.54] the first global
[8671.54 → 8672.78] illumination animated film
[8672.78 → 8675.72] oh I forget I don't
[8675.72 → 8677.34] know don't know all
[8677.34 → 8678.26] right never mind see
[8678.26 → 8679.38] you later uh but
[8679.38 → 8680.50] yeah yeah I would
[8680.50 → 8680.92] have I would have
[8680.92 → 8681.86] watched how to drain
[8681.86 → 8682.76] your dragon with RTX
[8682.76 → 8685.72] despicable me
[8685.72 → 8688.00] isn't monsters you
[8688.00 → 8688.62] DreamWorks
[8688.62 → 8691.90] um nope no
[8691.90 → 8693.14] never mind the first
[8693.14 → 8694.14] animated feature film
[8694.14 → 8694.62] to use global
[8694.62 → 8695.62] illumination was Shrek
[8695.62 → 8697.00] 2 Shrek 2 really
[8697.00 → 8699.16] oh shows you what
[8699.16 → 8700.12] shows you what I mean
[8700.12 → 8701.06] oh it's an AI summary
[8701.06 → 8701.64] so who knows
[8701.64 → 8704.42] top gear says yikes
[8704.42 → 8705.08] what do you mean
[8705.08 → 8705.88] Toy Story one looks
[8705.88 → 8707.28] amazing in 4k the
[8707.28 → 8708.42] detail is wild you're
[8708.42 → 8709.34] no you know what no
[8709.34 → 8710.80] no
[8710.80 → 8713.72] no um
[8713.72 → 8717.04] yeah Pixar's first was
[8717.04 → 8717.98] Monsters University
[8717.98 → 8719.14] if I go
[8719.14 → 8720.88] excuse me sorry if I go
[8720.88 → 8721.58] see it in the theatre
[8721.58 → 8722.38] it'll be because my
[8722.38 → 8723.04] daughters want to go
[8723.04 → 8723.94] they love dragons
[8723.94 → 8725.38] uh I think I would
[8725.38 → 8726.94] probably I'd probably
[8726.94 → 8729.96] man you can wait a long
[8729.96 → 8731.16] time for a 4k Blu-ray
[8731.16 → 8731.68] these days
[8731.68 → 8735.64] who sells blue rays
[8735.64 → 8736.44] I'd probably wait
[8736.44 → 8737.06] willow
[8737.06 → 8738.66] nice
[8738.66 → 8739.88] seems pretty cool
[8739.88 → 8741.06] yeah
[8741.06 → 8742.12] been around forever
[8742.12 → 8742.64] yeah
[8742.64 → 8743.76] I think I bought my
[8743.76 → 8745.26] favourite game from there
[8745.26 → 8746.30] when I was a child
[8746.30 → 8747.34] yeah
[8747.34 → 8748.14] nice
[8748.14 → 8750.12] by the way snack man
[8750.12 → 8751.42] how hungry are you
[8751.42 → 8753.14] me
[8753.14 → 8754.04] yeah we could dinner
[8754.04 → 8754.66] hungry
[8754.66 → 8755.72] we can go get food
[8755.72 → 8757.02] after the show
[8757.02 → 8760.24] nice, but you can't
[8760.24 → 8760.72] watch a movie
[8760.72 → 8762.60] what is wrong with you
[8762.60 → 8763.50] maybe not the whole
[8763.50 → 8764.46] duration of movies like
[8764.46 → 8766.04] for twice as long as
[8766.04 → 8766.44] getting food
[8766.44 → 8768.24] I mean it depends
[8768.24 → 8769.34] I'm realizing I have
[8769.34 → 8769.86] some time
[8769.86 → 8770.76] takes you a pretty long
[8770.76 → 8771.30] time to eat
[8771.30 → 8771.86] that's
[8771.86 → 8775.24] that's fair
[8775.24 → 8777.38] this is the world's
[8777.38 → 8778.06] the slowest eater I don't
[8778.06 → 8778.76] know how he stays as
[8778.76 → 8779.38] big as he is
[8779.38 → 8781.10] it's an it's because
[8781.10 → 8781.94] he's always eating
[8781.94 → 8783.24] yeah it has to be
[8783.24 → 8783.94] always eating
[8783.94 → 8784.30] yeah
[8784.30 → 8786.36] the runtime of last
[8786.36 → 8787.06] action here is two
[8787.06 → 8787.72] hours and ten minutes
[8787.72 → 8788.60] we could totally just
[8788.60 → 8789.28] go watch it
[8789.28 → 8791.18] that might be too long
[8791.18 → 8793.10] I've never heard you
[8793.10 → 8793.82] say those words before
[8793.82 → 8797.00] I really haven't
[8797.00 → 8797.60] I can
[8797.60 → 8798.08] I can
[8798.08 → 8804.04] i can
[8804.04 → 8804.88] check after the show
[8804.88 → 8805.40] he might have said
[8805.40 → 8806.26] them just not to me
[8806.26 → 8811.96] hi LLD
[8811.96 → 8813.12] what's it like living
[8813.12 → 8813.74] in Canada
[8813.74 → 8814.52] what do you like about
[8814.52 → 8814.96] it and what do you
[8814.96 → 8816.14] dislike or with change
[8816.14 → 8817.22] um
[8817.22 → 8819.00] generally feel pretty
[8819.00 → 8820.04] safe as long as you
[8820.04 → 8821.02] don't uh go to
[8821.02 → 8821.82] certain places
[8821.82 → 8822.86] or outside
[8822.86 → 8824.12] or city
[8824.12 → 8825.62] or um
[8825.62 → 8826.58] we're in a really
[8826.58 → 8827.40] temperate part of
[8827.40 → 8828.06] Canada so
[8828.06 → 8828.54] we don't really
[8828.54 → 8829.40] have to deal with
[8829.40 → 8830.42] the like harsh
[8830.42 → 8831.58] freezing Canadian
[8831.58 → 8832.48] winter but we also
[8832.48 → 8833.44] don't get sunlight
[8833.44 → 8834.84] for like six months
[8834.84 → 8835.26] out of the year
[8835.26 → 8835.78] so that's
[8835.78 → 8837.18] that's a whole thing
[8837.18 → 8837.94] um
[8837.94 → 8839.30] this time of year
[8839.30 → 8840.36] is beautiful though
[8840.36 → 8840.62] yeah
[8840.62 → 8841.42] it's like actually
[8841.42 → 8842.52] perfect um
[8842.52 → 8843.36] and I use that
[8843.36 → 8844.58] word very sparingly
[8844.58 → 8845.70] but the
[8845.70 → 8847.28] the spring and fall
[8847.28 → 8848.28] uh in Vancouver
[8848.28 → 8849.44] is like legitimately
[8849.44 → 8850.46] perfect when it's not
[8850.46 → 8850.70] raining
[8850.70 → 8852.66] our housing situation
[8852.66 → 8853.40] is despicable
[8853.40 → 8854.18] we had an incredibly
[8854.18 → 8855.08] long time to fix it
[8855.08 → 8855.94] did nothing about it
[8855.94 → 8856.30] at all
[8856.30 → 8857.94] yeah that's um
[8857.94 → 8859.22] that's number two
[8859.22 → 8860.08] on my list of things
[8860.08 → 8861.08] that I'm upset with
[8861.08 → 8862.40] um professor
[8862.40 → 8863.68] Justin Trudeau
[8863.68 → 8864.10] over
[8864.10 → 8865.30] um
[8865.30 → 8865.72] professor
[8865.72 → 8867.16] I don't know
[8867.16 → 8867.58] he taught
[8867.58 → 8868.16] nice
[8868.16 → 8869.22] I like it
[8869.22 → 8870.18] um
[8870.18 → 8871.34] that and
[8871.34 → 8872.40] not fixing our
[8872.40 → 8873.12] stupid
[8873.12 → 8874.34] first past the post
[8874.34 → 8875.06] voting system
[8875.06 → 8876.28] like he said he would
[8876.28 → 8877.08] like he said he would
[8877.08 → 8878.18] that he got elected on
[8878.18 → 8879.06] butthead
[8879.06 → 8879.78] anyway
[8879.78 → 8880.88] Canada was like
[8880.88 → 8881.84] actually going to do it
[8881.84 → 8882.64] yeah
[8882.64 → 8883.76] I was excited
[8883.76 → 8884.46] and then he was like
[8884.46 → 8885.08] forget it

[8893.52 → 8894.48] situation is
[8894.48 → 8895.76] is horrible
[8895.76 → 8896.80] and contributes
[8896.80 → 8897.46] heavily
[8897.46 → 8898.34] to
[8898.34 → 8899.32] a cost of living
[8899.32 → 8900.30] that is already
[8900.30 → 8901.28] higher than other
[8901.28 → 8902.60] like g whatever
[8902.60 → 8903.32] however many there
[8903.32 → 8903.84] are nations
[8903.84 → 8905.28] um
[8905.28 → 8911.22] there are issues
[8911.22 → 8911.64] with it
[8911.64 → 8912.40] in general
[8912.40 → 8913.44] I've been very
[8913.44 → 8914.52] pleased to have
[8914.52 → 8915.30] socialized health care
[8915.30 → 8915.80] in my life
[8915.80 → 8917.06] there are issues

[8923.24 → 8924.90] they're okay
[8924.90 → 8925.78] which is nice
[8925.78 → 8926.34] but there are
[8926.34 → 8927.00] examples where
[8927.00 → 8927.82] the people have
[8927.82 → 8928.40] not been okay
[8928.40 → 8928.92] yep

[8976.04 → 8976.46] at switching
[8976.46 → 8977.08] phones over
[8977.08 → 8977.94] it
[8977.94 → 8979.68] haven't daily
[8979.68 → 8980.26] driven it
[8980.26 → 8984.12] so dry
[8984.12 → 8984.64] just stop

[8989.56 → 8990.42] I want
[8990.42 → 8990.82] a snack
[8990.82 → 8991.12] that's
[8991.12 → 8991.68] not as
[8991.68 → 8991.88] dry
[8991.88 → 8992.28] as dog
[8992.28 → 8992.62] food
[8992.62 → 8993.16] um
[8993.16 → 8993.78] they're
[8993.78 → 8994.00] pretty
[8994.00 → 8994.64] goofy
[8994.64 → 8995.42] I haven't
[8995.42 → 8995.84] daily driven
[8995.84 → 8996.40] it and
[8996.40 → 8996.88] what I was
[8996.88 → 8997.60] told in
[8997.60 → 8998.32] my edge
[8998.32 → 8998.94] in the comments
[8998.94 → 8999.30] under the
[8999.30 → 8999.92] edge unboxing
[8999.92 → 9000.44] over on
[9000.44 → 9000.92] short circuit
[9000.92 → 9002.54] is that
[9002.54 → 9003.22] the
[9003.22 → 9003.78] the drag
[9003.78 → 9004.22] down from
[9004.22 → 9004.64] the top
[9004.64 → 9005.24] you can
[9005.24 → 9005.48] actually
[9005.48 → 9006.10] change that
[9006.10 → 9006.38] in the
[9006.38 → 9006.62] settings
[9006.62 → 9006.90] you can
[9006.90 → 9007.14] make it
[9007.14 → 9007.36] so it
[9007.36 → 9007.78] just works
[9007.78 → 9008.08] the old
[9008.08 → 9008.24] way
[9008.24 → 9008.42] and you
[9008.42 → 9008.58] don't
[9008.58 → 9008.86] have to
[9008.86 → 9009.02] drag
[9009.02 → 9009.32] from the
[9009.32 → 9009.56] corner
[9009.56 → 9011.90] but I'll

[9556.78 → 9560.62] huh what no, no i I'm gonna
[9560.62 → 9561.82] i have to find the right spot
[9561.82 → 9562.78] but you can do a thing yeah
[9562.78 → 9564.18] but it's coming are they not
[9564.18 → 9566.98] here oh, oh no you guys can
[9566.98 → 9568.64] hear that yeah okay I got you
[9568.64 → 9570.98] uh so I'm going to tell you
[9570.98 → 9573.00] about three submixes with
[9573.00 → 9576.20] loud fight music here Luke i
[9576.20 → 9577.34] might be able to fix that it's
[9577.34 → 9578.72] fine it's fine I got two
[9578.72 → 9580.28] headphone mixes I got so many
[9580.28 → 9582.46] mixes um but yeah the vet the
[9582.46 → 9583.50] vet said that he's doing well
[9583.50 → 9585.66] uh but has decided to keep him
[9585.66 → 9587.62] for like 48 hours just to make
[9587.62 → 9589.42] sure that's actually true he had
[9589.42 → 9591.56] not lost weight which is often a
[9591.56 → 9594.58] sing of things going poorly um and
[9594.58 → 9597.42] he's uh looking good has good
[9597.42 → 9599.30] energy all that kind of stuff uh the
[9599.30 → 9600.64] night that he's puking it did not
[9600.64 → 9604.32] look good at all um i kind of
[9604.32 → 9605.76] thought it was the end to be
[9605.76 → 9607.38] completely honest, but he held
[9607.38 → 9608.78] through and then was fine the next
[9608.78 → 9611.16] day so uh things seem to be okay
[9611.16 → 9613.10] uh that does not mean we're getting
[9613.10 → 9614.98] away from the seven things of
[9614.98 → 9618.46] medicine a day um so that's rough
[9618.46 → 9623.10] but uh yeah it is what it is
[9623.10 → 9626.98] but you know they don't live forever
[9626.98 → 9628.92] so we'll see how it goes, but he's
[9628.92 → 9629.98] he's hanging in there right now
[9630.70 → 9638.66] that seems like a lot it is a lot
[9638.66 → 9641.48] there's um it also has to be spaced
[9641.48 → 9645.16] out, so there's one that it has to be
[9645.16 → 9646.96] given every 12 hours and no other
[9646.96 → 9648.48] thing of medicine can be given within
[9648.48 → 9650.94] an hour of it so he has to receive
[9650.94 → 9652.70] this thing of medicine and then wait
[9652.70 → 9655.60] an hour, and then he receives
[9655.60 → 9660.36] I think it's three right then
[9660.36 → 9664.20] pretty sure, and then you have to wait
[9664.20 → 9666.90] 11 hours and then give him the one
[9666.90 → 9668.96] and then wait one hour and then give
[9668.96 → 9671.18] two and then
[9671.18 → 9676.86] constant scoop I hate to ask but is
[9676.86 → 9678.38] scoop doing okay scoop is doing fine
[9678.38 → 9681.62] scoop is doing all good
[9681.62 → 9685.40] and nixie is the name that
[9685.40 → 9688.54] we've given to the foundling bird the
[9688.54 → 9691.50] rescued bird and uh Dixie is also
[9691.50 → 9692.88] doing totally fine
[9692.88 → 9696.12] what headphone are you okay here we go
[9696.12 → 9697.62] oh okay
[9697.62 → 9703.14] uh ready hold on here we go ready
[9703.14 → 9704.04] yeah okay
[9704.04 → 9710.28] so that's just part of it
[9710.28 → 9714.20] watch your content ID hold on okay
[9714.20 → 9716.02] so you can
[9716.02 → 9718.62] no dang it
[9718.62 → 9720.16] dang it
[9720.16 → 9725.80] so they've used that same with some
[9725.80 → 9726.88] horses a bit yeah
[9726.88 → 9730.28] and it's its just cut off there so
[9730.28 → 9731.66] they're they're using the same
[9731.66 → 9732.94] sound effects library
[9732.94 → 9735.58] almost certainly there's a couple of
[9735.58 → 9738.70] other spots in the sieve 2 battle
[9738.70 → 9740.64] noises and in the battle noises for
[9740.64 → 9744.94] this fight um that use the same
[9744.94 → 9746.76] bits of tracks so they've obviously
[9746.76 → 9749.28] mixed them in their own way, but it's
[9749.28 → 9751.48] it's definitely the same library
[9751.48 → 9753.98] which I thought was I don't know it
[9753.98 → 9755.20] stood out to me as someone who had
[9755.20 → 9756.62] played hours and hours and hours of
[9756.62 → 9759.18] sieve 2 when I watched this film and
[9759.18 → 9761.22] I was like hold on a minute wait a
[9761.22 → 9761.78] second
[9761.78 → 9765.86] world travel says that was definitely
[9765.86 → 9766.68] worth the wait
[9766.68 → 9770.10] dude I had to tell the whole bird story
[9770.10 → 9772.30] with that sound in my headphones the
[9772.30 → 9773.72] entire time I was working on it, I was
[9773.72 → 9775.36] about to i was about to cut it out
[9775.36 → 9777.72] no i have to i have to sub next with it
[9777.72 → 9778.88] with it as a minus
[9778.88 → 9782.74] Linus is still watching it okay I'm just
[9782.74 → 9785.66] going to mute that for everybody but I was
[9785.66 → 9788.44] still listening all right fine I'm over
[9788.44 → 9790.20] you can turn it back on I can turn it
[9790.20 → 9791.38] back on no I'm good I got it I can
[9791.38 → 9792.60] play whatever you want I can remove him
[9792.60 → 9794.06] from our headphones too I don't even want
[9794.06 → 9794.38] it
[9794.38 → 9799.62] fine I'll turn you off oh that's
[9799.62 → 9800.00] unfortunate
[9800.00 → 9802.94] yeah you're making me sad don't do that
[9802.94 → 9807.00] come on we're just getting into it hey
[9807.00 → 9809.92] LLD how is this how does this swimsuit
[9809.92 → 9811.82] compare to the previous swimsuit looking
[9811.82 → 9814.10] at the photos it appears to have a finer
[9814.10 → 9814.44] mesh
[9814.44 → 9817.30] is a bit heavier in material, and you use
[9817.30 → 9818.30] zipper pockets
[9818.30 → 9821.40] oh in here those are definitely some
[9821.40 → 9821.76] things
[9821.76 → 9826.40] um it also has less stretchy um draw
[9826.40 → 9827.96] cords because the previous one was
[9827.96 → 9830.00] super stretchy you had to like you had
[9830.00 → 9832.10] to like stretching it in order to tie it
[9832.10 → 9834.34] in such a way that it felt really
[9834.34 → 9834.76] secure
[9834.76 → 9839.64] I believe the waistband is a little bit
[9839.64 → 9840.82] uh little thicker
[9840.82 → 9844.54] um there was a there was a area
[9844.54 → 9847.64] where sand could accumulate in the liner
[9847.64 → 9850.00] somewhere that wasn't like in a pocket
[9850.00 → 9853.04] on the old one uh so we patched that
[9853.04 → 9856.64] and yes the zipper pockets are huge that
[9856.64 → 9859.28] was uh or the zipper pocket so it has a
[9859.28 → 9860.64] zipper pocket on the back oh
[9860.64 → 9864.78] uh that was and also an um yeah there you go pocket
[9864.78 → 9868.86] yeah hidden zipper pocket uh inside the regular pocket bag
[9868.86 → 9875.56] that's a very sizeable secret pocket yeah it's an it's look I know it's an it's a
[9875.56 → 9882.14] seventy dollar swimsuit or whatever, but we don't we're not charging money for
[9882.14 → 9887.56] nothing um we tried to make a really nice swimsuit
[9887.56 → 9892.58] whoa with the fact in mind that a lot of the time when you wear a swimsuit it's not just for
[9892.58 → 9896.50] swimming like that's what you're wearing that day
[9896.50 → 9900.26] dude I can fit my phone and my wallet in that secret zipper pocket yeah
[9900.26 → 9903.16] that's crazy yeah that that was the idea
[9903.16 → 9905.42] I'm both in there
[9905.42 → 9910.44] I'm going to take those out of there before I completely forget where they are
[9910.44 → 9917.92] and the last one I've got for you today you said that short circuit videos were
[9917.92 → 9921.70] unboxing plus not review minus what exactly does that mean
[9921.70 → 9925.14] given that so many viewers view them as reviews would you mind clearing this up
[9925.14 → 9930.98] um basically what it means is that rather than intending to be comprehensive
[9930.98 → 9940.02] we are intending for them to be first impressions of the host but with the benefit of testing that's
[9940.02 → 9945.84] been done to clarify any points that the manufacturer may have been deceptive about
[9945.84 → 9951.58] so with an unboxing that's not plus you're basically just relying on whatever the manufacturer
[9951.58 → 9958.16] said and whatever you can observe at that moment with a review I expect the host or a proxy
[9958.16 → 9965.80] to have extensively used the product and evaluated it in between that is unboxing plus
[9965.80 → 9971.56] where it's based on your initial impressions, and you do rely on materials from the manufacturer
[9971.56 → 9978.44] but in cases where you are able you have information that has been independently validated
[9978.44 → 9988.02] that's all I have to say about that I mean it ties into you use this reference and it
[9988.02 → 9992.38] it helped it click for me because I was kind of trying to figure out what short circuit was
[9992.38 → 9998.82] um, but you're talking about how back in the back in the day when we would do more unboxing on the LTT
[9998.82 → 10006.52] channel you if a product wasn't brand new you would often use other review sites and show the
[10006.52 → 10010.52] other review sites in the video I don't know if saying often is fair, but this is a thing that would
[10010.52 → 10015.96] happen uh where we would reference a review site and their performance graphs it was an unboxing
[10015.96 → 10022.54] yeah, but we'd be like yeah and according to this uh you know review on tweak town uh it really does
[10022.54 → 10027.14] it really does match up with what the manufacturer says about how fast it is yeah so now we're just
[10027.14 → 10032.76] doing that but with our own data yeah and it's not everything we don't have the capacity or
[10032.76 → 10038.04] capability to test every element of every product we unbox yeah so they're unboxing plus
[10038.04 → 10048.68] and then I lied there is one more hello Linus Luke and Dan I just wanted to shout out my husband who
[10048.68 → 10052.38] is working his butt off for the company we are starting together nice do you have any advice
[10052.38 → 10061.96] for a husband wife entrepreneur teams listen yeah that's it that's the advice listen hey listen
[10061.96 → 10074.48] um be ready to be ready to try a bad idea prepare yourself for it now because even if your spouse, or you know your
[10074.48 → 10079.02] business partner not even necessarily just for husband wives uh or husband hub wife whatever
[10079.02 → 10083.56] you know your business partner even if they're the smartest person in the world
[10083.56 → 10090.38] occasionally they're going to have a bad idea and there's no room for inflexibility
[10090.38 → 10097.34] in a relationship like that you both have to be ready to try each other's bad ideas and you both
[10097.34 → 10106.52] have to have the humility to back down when it didn't work sorry what which of my bad ideas are
