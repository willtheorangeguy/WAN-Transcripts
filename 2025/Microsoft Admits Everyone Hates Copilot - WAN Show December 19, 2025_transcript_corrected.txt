[0.00 → 9.54] What is up everybody and welcome to an early Christmas present.
[10.40 → 12.48] The WAN show, but earlier.
[15.06 → 18.84] Oh, we've got so much good news for you guys this week.
[18.98 → 25.66] Meta is tolerating rampant fraud through their ads in order to make more money.
[26.58 → 28.84] Wow, good job Meta.
[28.84 → 33.48] Truly keeping your shareholders safe at the expense of everybody else.
[33.80 → 38.26] In other news, Microsoft seems to have said the quiet part out loud.
[38.68 → 41.74] That nobody cares at all about Copilot.
[42.12 → 45.96] And that it just kind of doesn't really matter.
[46.04 → 47.00] But also they're still committed.
[47.36 → 48.06] They're still committed.
[48.26 → 49.40] They're going to cram it down your throat.
[49.56 → 50.20] Open up your throat.
[50.40 → 51.12] Open it up now.
[51.28 → 52.96] Because I'm going to cram it in there.
[53.58 → 53.94] Yeah.
[55.10 → 56.12] That's Microsoft.
[56.96 → 57.68] Sachin Adela.
[57.68 → 60.06] He's going for it.
[60.06 → 61.96] Sachin Adela wants to cram it down your throat.
[62.02 → 64.16] That's why he's bald.
[64.28 → 65.30] That should have been the WAN title.
[65.30 → 66.90] It's so he can dive in.
[67.48 → 68.88] That should have been the WAN title.
[69.04 → 69.82] Right down there.
[70.96 → 73.32] The thumbnail text is just...
[73.32 → 81.64] You know, you have to recover just long enough to do a couple topics.
[82.28 → 83.56] Minutes into the show.
[85.82 → 86.22] Okay.
[86.74 → 88.70] You took the one I really wanted to do.
[89.38 → 89.68] I know.
[89.76 → 90.38] That's what I do.
[90.64 → 91.20] Good job.
[91.20 → 97.02] NVIDIA reportedly plans a 30 to 40% cut in GeForce GPU production.
[97.14 → 98.04] Nobody saw this coming.
[98.18 → 99.66] It's a surprise to everyone for sure.
[99.78 → 101.30] Also, the Apocalypse continues.
[101.50 → 102.54] Also surprised to every...
[102.54 → 103.02] You're surprised.
[103.06 → 103.32] Actually?
[103.42 → 103.88] I'm surprised.
[104.00 → 104.18] Really?
[104.72 → 105.34] No, of course not.
[105.40 → 105.54] Yeah.
[105.58 → 105.80] Okay.
[106.02 → 106.42] Nice.
[107.46 → 108.22] Intro time.
[108.42 → 108.68] Oh!
[108.88 → 109.30] What?
[109.46 → 109.80] What?
[109.80 → 111.80] Oh!
[115.16 → 116.14] No way!
[118.14 → 119.32] I have my gamer tanked.
[120.32 → 125.22] That was fantastic.
[126.34 → 126.54] Oh!
[127.54 → 128.82] You keep talking over the music.
[128.96 → 132.96] The show is brought to you by MSI, Squarespace, Sale, and Messi.
[133.08 → 136.80] Of course, alongside our rap partner, Brand, our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner...
[137.50 → 138.20] Get re...
[138.20 → 139.08] Secret re...
[139.08 → 141.64] Let's go!
[142.04 → 146.50] Now, I do want to say, Loki, that was an incredible...
[146.50 → 147.00] That was fantastic.
[147.20 → 153.40] Incredible Sancho intro variant, but there is one minor detail that you got unforgivably
[153.40 → 153.78] wrong.
[154.36 → 154.54] What?
[154.80 → 157.02] I would never beat Luke at video games.
[157.48 → 158.28] You do?
[158.54 → 158.90] Yeah.
[159.46 → 160.54] I will win, like...
[160.54 → 165.64] I'll steal a couple rounds from you when we first pick up a new game, and then after
[165.64 → 168.82] that, it's basically just like the Luke Shrew Linus show.
[168.82 → 169.80] I don't think it's that clear.
[170.04 → 171.16] You've always said this.
[171.24 → 171.62] I don't think...
[171.62 → 172.24] Disc jam.
[172.24 → 172.30] Okay.
[172.52 → 172.84] Okay.
[174.66 → 177.60] A one-off example is not fair enough.
[177.78 → 179.32] What was that game?
[179.44 → 182.62] It was like a jump around everywhere archery...
[182.62 → 183.08] Tower fall?
[183.64 → 184.04] Tower fall?
[184.04 → 185.94] We traded back and forth a lot on Tower fall.
[186.06 → 189.82] Yeah, because I have like five times as many hours in it as you.
[190.32 → 190.68] Okay.
[191.82 → 192.58] I don't know.
[192.58 → 199.44] Also, my childhood was 2D side-scrolling and jumping, and yours was Halo.
[199.98 → 203.62] Right, but then you look at games like Halo, and you're like, you beat me at those games,
[203.66 → 204.20] and it's like, yeah.
[204.50 → 207.36] And then I look at games like those, and I say, you beat me at those games, and
[207.36 → 208.72] you'd be like, yeah, but I grew up with those.
[208.96 → 209.88] Like, it has to be equal.
[209.88 → 212.22] Yeah, but I had so many more hours in it, too.
[212.34 → 214.12] Yeah, but I also had so many more hours in shooters.
[214.26 → 216.32] I am trying to pay you a compliment.
[216.90 → 217.94] Just take it.
[218.36 → 220.80] No, not at expense of others.
[221.32 → 221.90] Oh, that's true.
[221.96 → 224.74] I am better than I at super checks, but that's not a video game.
[225.38 → 226.42] So...
[226.42 → 233.34] I will vibe code super checks the video game.
[234.20 → 236.74] Then I will win a video game against Luke.
[237.20 → 238.90] He'd find a way to win if it was a video game.
[238.90 → 239.44] I was going to say, I don't know, dude.
[239.52 → 239.84] Yeah.
[239.84 → 241.82] I might figure that out.
[241.82 → 250.40] Speaking of which, Meta has found a way to figure out how to keep the billions of dollars
[250.40 → 257.74] in revenue that they are making from fraudulent advertisers who are just using ads on Meta's
[257.74 → 259.22] platforms to, well...
[259.22 → 259.74] Good job, Zuck.
[259.96 → 260.78] ...defraud people.
[261.22 → 267.94] This is based on a Reuters report that shows that internal documents, allegedly, show that
[267.94 → 273.56] Meta understood that a large portion of its advertising revenue from Chinese partners,
[274.38 → 277.62] and this is not like a little bit of large portion.
[277.94 → 283.94] This is like roughly 19% of their advertising revenue in 2024.
[283.94 → 299.20] Over $3 billion came from ads that were tied to, and brace yourself, scams, illegal gambling, pornography, and other prohibited content.
[299.88 → 303.94] Then, seeing all that, Meta went, hmm...
[303.94 → 308.48] Well, what we could do is we could crack down on this.
[309.64 → 311.86] But, but, hear me out, hear me out.
[312.10 → 312.80] Alternate plan.
[313.52 → 315.32] We could not.
[316.66 → 319.10] And make billions of dollars.
[319.10 → 330.66] From bogus products in Taiwan to investment scams in the US and Canada, China has become a major source of scam ads on Meta's platforms globally.
[331.22 → 339.36] A special China-focused anti-fraud team initially was able to cut this problematic Chinese ad revenue nearly in half.
[339.36 → 356.30] But, all of this is allegedly, because I do not work for Reuters, and I did not do the reporting for this, allegedly, after a strategy shift influenced by the Zuck himself, the team was apparently disbanded, and tougher enforcement measures were shelved.
[357.26 → 364.84] In a big surprise to everyone, especially the Zuck, fraudulent ads, and therefore the revenue associated with them, rebounded.
[365.18 → 366.40] I wonder when this was.
[366.40 → 371.78] Was this during, like, his big layoff, when he was like, we need to...
[371.78 → 372.88] The year of efficiency?
[373.04 → 374.98] No, I think it's more recent than that.
[375.32 → 376.02] Actually, you know what?
[376.08 → 377.06] No, don't quote me on that.
[377.24 → 377.86] Let's leave it.
[378.16 → 381.96] Go check out the link to Reuters, which Dan will throw in the video chat.
[382.30 → 383.42] Description chat.
[383.72 → 384.46] No, throw in the chat.
[386.36 → 396.28] A big part of the reason that this works so well is that Meta's ad ecosystem in China relies on layers of resellers that obscure advertisers' identities.
[396.40 → 398.76] Making it easier for scammers to place ads.
[399.62 → 405.02] Consultants warned that this setup enables fraud, and that Meta's enforcement was weaker than their competitors.
[405.62 → 412.58] And it appears that they just don't care, because they'd rather just take the money and go,
[412.96 → 414.70] La la la, la la la la la.
[414.78 → 417.46] I don't know that fraudulent ads are happening on the platform.
[417.66 → 418.22] La la la la la.
[418.22 → 424.90] I mean, I just, to me, even with the network of resellers, it doesn't seem that complicated.
[425.80 → 433.48] Because apparently it's like, I read the article, apparently it's like 11 main, top-level resellers or something like that.
[433.48 → 441.06] So if Meta cared at all, even with the whole layers of resellers thing, just pushing the responsibility onto them and going,
[441.14 → 445.66] Yeah, I will literally ban you if too much of this crap makes it through.
[445.88 → 449.70] You know how so many things in life are bell curves?
[449.70 → 458.04] And there's that whole meme where there's like the person who's just like chill about a thing because they're like ignorant to it or whatever.
[458.04 → 464.30] And then the person freaking out about the thing because they're at like a medium level of skill or knowledge.
[464.44 → 469.74] And then on the other end, it's just someone who's like extremely skilled or extremely knowledgeable, and they're just chill again.
[470.10 → 474.04] I feel like this kind of applies to this situation as well.
[474.14 → 474.26] Really?
[474.30 → 475.48] This is kind of a wild take.
[475.64 → 476.98] Let's see where he's going with this.
[476.98 → 482.00] A tiny company can often get away with just like not caring or paying attention to these types of things.
[482.12 → 483.06] Oh, I see what you mean.
[483.06 → 489.32] A medium-sized company gets like crushed by everyone because you're now big enough.
[489.42 → 490.64] You have to care about these things.
[490.96 → 493.92] And then huge companies just get to ignore them again.
[494.08 → 496.36] They get to basically not have customer service.
[496.52 → 500.98] They get to not police things like ads or anything else on their platforms because they're like,
[501.02 → 501.92] I don't know, we're too big.
[501.96 → 502.68] We can't do that anymore.
[502.68 → 504.06] Of course, that's totally fine.
[504.06 → 508.64] Even though they like definitely, definitely have the resources to do so.
[508.86 → 508.90] Yep.
[509.06 → 520.80] It's interesting how like requirements, policies, upholding certain standards and stuff are really, really, really, really pushed for it.
[520.84 → 522.88] Like the middle size.
[523.80 → 524.30] This is wild.
[524.40 → 525.10] I saved this.
[526.10 → 526.62] Facebook.
[526.62 → 526.78] Facebook.
[527.30 → 533.68] I think I talked about this last week, how Facebook sent me an invitation to use some feature on my page.
[533.82 → 535.24] Do you need to search for, oh, never mind.
[535.48 → 535.64] Yeah.
[535.72 → 536.40] No, no, I got it.
[536.50 → 536.60] Okay.
[536.64 → 542.42] They create a fan challenge to keep your audience engaged with your page on Facebook.
[542.82 → 545.64] They sent me the same thing again.
[545.64 → 552.12] In fact, here you can see in the last week, I have three emails from Facebook.
[552.44 → 554.92] One, two, three.
[555.12 → 562.70] All with the same subject line for the Linus Tech Tips page on Facebook to create this fan challenge.
[563.08 → 571.36] Now, I've gone into the Facebook dashboard, and I'm not an expert on like Facebook page management or profile management or advertising or anything.
[571.36 → 577.92] I log into Facebook as infrequently as I can, and I only really use it for marketplace at this point.
[578.44 → 586.56] So, I'm not going to claim that I have done the world's greatest job of, you know, finding where to turn this off.
[586.66 → 593.94] But what I have done is I've gone into my Facebook dashboard, and I've turned off every communication method that I could find.
[593.94 → 602.12] Because I don't want emails from them unless it's something to do with like the taxation for like paying out our Facebook video ads.
[602.28 → 602.34] Sure.
[602.34 → 605.94] Which were a thing for a while and honestly now they're not even that much.
[606.66 → 609.68] I don't think we're really making pretty much anything on Facebook anymore.
[610.18 → 614.22] You know, they had that big push into video like, I don't know, six years ago or something like that.
[614.26 → 614.46] Anyway.
[614.64 → 615.24] However long.
[615.30 → 616.04] Yeah, four or five.
[616.14 → 616.42] I don't know.
[618.58 → 619.34] It happened though.
[619.42 → 620.06] I'm going to go over here.
[620.90 → 621.22] Yeah.
[622.34 → 623.34] We're both hanging out.
[623.34 → 627.86] So, I don't want to miss an important message.
[628.02 → 631.22] So, I can't just filter every message from Facebook.
[631.78 → 633.88] So, I wanted to turn off specifically this.
[634.22 → 643.50] Now, in Canada anyway, we have a law called Can Spam that dictates that you are not allowed to send an email that is unsolicited.
[643.86 → 646.82] And you need to have a clear way to unsubscribe.
[646.82 → 658.94] Luke, can you find in this email any even attempt to adhere to Can Spam regulations?
[659.20 → 659.80] Not in the slightest.
[659.80 → 670.66] There is not only no button to unsubscribe from this email, but there isn't even a link to my dashboard for where to turn it off.
[670.80 → 679.92] I have someone in particular that I might be actually genuinely enforcing to, reporting to Can Spam stuff.
[679.92 → 681.92] Wait, Can Spam is US law?
[682.76 → 683.98] Canada is CALL?
[685.02 → 686.50] Am I crazy?
[687.72 → 688.36] Can Spam.
[689.48 → 690.80] Holy shit.
[690.80 → 697.48] If you look up Can Spam, it does bring up Canada's anti-spam legislation.
[697.66 → 697.82] Huh.
[698.18 → 698.40] Cool.
[698.88 → 699.26] Okay.
[699.80 → 702.58] Then they're violating US law and Canadian law.
[702.66 → 703.16] That's cool.
[703.30 → 704.64] But it is called CALL.
[704.80 → 707.16] It's interesting when you Google it that it brings up Canada's.
[707.52 → 707.74] Yeah.
[707.74 → 710.20] I completely Mandela affected myself.
[710.20 → 714.24] I suspect this is a commonly Mandela affected one, considering it brings up Canada's.
[714.60 → 715.08] Anyway.
[715.16 → 716.28] But it is CALL.
[716.38 → 717.36] The commentary is correct.
[717.76 → 718.22] Cool.
[718.56 → 719.36] Thank you for that.
[719.54 → 721.80] And also, doesn't change the point.
[722.82 → 723.32] It is interesting.
[723.36 → 723.80] You're right.
[723.98 → 728.54] A really, tiny company would probably get away with just like sending out unsolicited.
[728.70 → 729.44] You'd kind of go.
[729.50 → 730.46] Because most people are like, whatever.
[730.78 → 731.28] I get it.
[731.42 → 731.64] Yeah.
[731.88 → 732.16] You know.
[732.26 → 733.38] They probably don't even know.
[733.38 → 738.30] And like enforcing every policy for freaking everywhere is honestly just impossible.
[739.12 → 739.96] So whatever.
[740.80 → 743.28] And then you get to a certain size and everyone's like, oh.
[743.38 → 744.20] Hey, you should really.
[744.38 → 747.46] You need to comply with every single thing everywhere in the entire world all the time.
[747.48 → 749.48] Or else we will delete your entire company.
[749.64 → 751.18] And then you get to that size.
[751.26 → 753.78] And it's like, well, you're not going to touch them anyway.
[753.78 → 755.88] And even if you do, they're not going to care about the fines.
[755.88 → 759.70] Because it's probably worth it to them to just pay the fines that are ultimately like.
[759.70 → 764.48] They'll be like, oh, yeah, by violating this policy, we made $382 million.
[764.94 → 767.10] And the fine costs $15 million.
[767.64 → 768.02] So like.
[768.40 → 769.44] Cost of doing business, baby.
[769.62 → 771.44] That's the best cost of doing business I've ever heard of.
[771.50 → 772.00] Sounds good.
[772.08 → 772.70] Pay the fine.
[772.86 → 773.32] Like it's.
[773.60 → 776.04] You just hit these levels where it just doesn't matter anymore.
[776.28 → 776.76] And it's.
[776.76 → 777.06] It's.
[777.72 → 778.38] It's funky.
[778.76 → 779.00] Yeah.
[779.08 → 781.46] And I'm not surprised that they're shirking like all of this stuff.
[781.52 → 783.16] Because who cares?
[783.38 → 784.76] People aren't going to stop using them.
[784.96 → 785.58] Because that's another thing.
[785.58 → 790.48] You hit like a certain level of critical mass where people can scream about it all they
[790.48 → 790.72] want.
[790.78 → 792.28] But they're not going to stop using meta services.
[792.46 → 793.92] Maybe a tiny handful.
[794.10 → 797.58] But like it's not going to significantly impact their actual like user base.
[797.80 → 799.18] Lieutenant Salty says.
[800.22 → 804.62] My boss sends out emails using our POS software.
[804.74 → 806.86] We send texts and emails.
[807.44 → 809.90] And I've told my boss he needs to have an unsubscribe option.
[810.00 → 810.66] He's just like.
[811.30 → 811.46] Nah.
[811.46 → 811.62] Yeah.
[813.90 → 814.30] Yeah.
[814.46 → 814.70] Yeah.
[814.86 → 816.50] Apparently that's what the Zuck said too.
[817.14 → 817.38] Nah.
[817.54 → 817.76] But yeah.
[817.76 → 818.04] I've got.
[818.10 → 820.78] I've got somebody who sends emails to my.
[820.86 → 821.88] My personal email inbox.
[822.04 → 822.84] And I don't even care.
[822.94 → 823.98] That's a dumpster fire.
[824.10 → 824.28] But.
[825.86 → 826.64] I have.
[826.64 → 827.22] I have.
[828.02 → 829.58] Unsubscribed multiple times.
[830.04 → 832.20] And blocked them multiple times.
[832.44 → 834.56] But they keep just taking their.
[834.92 → 835.72] Email list.
[835.86 → 837.86] And bringing it over to different email services.
[839.24 → 839.92] Because I am.
[839.98 → 841.38] I'm sure they just know this happens.
[841.64 → 841.80] Yeah.
[841.88 → 844.32] And like I've never actually done a report before.
[844.40 → 845.32] But I might actually do it.
[845.46 → 847.38] Because I have blocked and unsubscribed.
[847.52 → 849.30] At least close to 10 times.
[849.44 → 850.40] I have a.
[850.54 → 852.36] I have a conspiracy theory.
[853.16 → 854.86] That the unsubscribe button.
[854.86 → 857.26] Is actually just to verify that it's a real inbox.
[857.40 → 859.60] I am 100% certain that happens at least sometimes.
[859.60 → 861.40] Because I know of at least one case.
[862.84 → 863.84] And so I.
[864.04 → 864.38] So my.
[864.60 → 867.26] They might even actually unsubscribe you to that list.
[867.26 → 869.96] But then sell the information.
[870.36 → 872.02] That you're definitely a real person.
[872.12 → 872.96] Reading their actual email.
[872.98 → 873.98] To their other company.
[874.18 → 874.34] Yeah.
[874.58 → 874.82] To.
[877.14 → 877.54] Yep.
[877.54 → 878.08] Very cool.
[878.08 → 880.62] I feel like in medieval times.
[880.72 → 881.52] They would have just like.
[881.52 → 881.84] Oh.
[882.42 → 883.32] Kanara just said.
[883.46 → 884.62] I work for an e-com company.
[884.76 → 886.22] And we have migrated email servers.
[886.54 → 887.92] Servers multiple times.
[888.00 → 888.72] The last five years.
[888.72 → 890.60] For the very reason you mentioned.
[891.48 → 892.54] That's rough.
[892.80 → 893.82] Thanks for letting me know.
[893.86 → 894.48] That is interesting.
[894.68 → 895.50] But also.
[895.74 → 897.48] I think this person is literally like.
[897.60 → 898.28] More than.
[898.92 → 900.12] One or two times a year.
[900.12 → 902.98] It's very often.
[903.62 → 903.84] Like.
[905.28 → 906.20] But that is.
[906.28 → 906.46] You know.
[906.50 → 907.86] I'm not surprised by these things.
[907.86 → 908.26] It's.
[908.36 → 908.76] And this is.
[908.86 → 909.96] This is kind of what I'm talking about.
[910.02 → 911.06] Like at a certain scale.
[911.54 → 912.96] You just don't care.
[913.08 → 914.14] And you work around it.
[915.00 → 916.28] And at the bottom scale.
[916.66 → 917.78] Other people don't care.
[917.92 → 918.94] And then in the middle.
[919.14 → 920.36] You get crushed by both.
[920.78 → 921.22] Realistic.
[921.72 → 922.30] Not realistic.
[923.18 → 924.18] You get crushed by.
[924.34 → 926.28] By both like governmental regulation stuff.
[926.48 → 926.88] And.
[927.76 → 928.68] People expectations.
[929.30 → 929.68] I'm reporting.
[929.68 → 930.40] This is a spam.
[930.66 → 930.78] So.
[930.94 → 932.10] It's a great filter.
[932.24 → 933.48] And Google won't do anything.
[934.12 → 934.34] Nope.
[936.20 → 936.60] Oh.
[936.74 → 937.50] I just blocked it.
[937.68 → 937.88] Whoops.
[938.06 → 938.24] No.
[938.36 → 938.72] I don't.
[939.18 → 939.62] You know what?
[939.72 → 940.02] Fine.
[940.38 → 940.76] F*** it.
[941.80 → 944.26] I'm just never going to get an email from Facebook again.
[944.26 → 944.58] Apparently.
[950.92 → 951.28] Actually.
[951.36 → 952.16] I really shouldn't do that.
[952.28 → 953.46] If we don't know about taxes.
[953.56 → 954.24] We don't have to pay them.
[954.30 → 954.44] Right?
[955.24 → 956.14] Is that how that works?
[956.28 → 956.52] No.
[956.58 → 956.86] Actually.
[956.86 → 957.84] Our current issue.
[958.16 → 958.80] Is that me.
[958.80 → 963.24] They are withholding some taxes from us.
[963.24 → 964.34] That they shouldn't be.
[964.48 → 965.34] Because we're Canadian.
[966.02 → 966.20] Oh.
[966.20 → 968.08] And Yvonne has like a long chain.
[968.16 → 969.28] Going back and forth with them.
[969.52 → 970.88] I haven't actually brought that.
[970.94 → 972.50] Because it's a separate support team.
[972.64 → 973.20] For like actual.
[973.26 → 974.10] They have a support team.
[974.24 → 974.94] For like money.
[975.22 → 975.54] Right.
[975.64 → 976.52] But just like.
[976.68 → 977.64] Managing your page.
[978.04 → 978.44] I'm just.
[978.56 → 979.12] My account.
[979.24 → 981.04] Like I don't have anything special in there.
[981.14 → 981.36] So.
[981.36 → 982.72] No.
[982.72 → 982.76] No.
[983.00 → 983.50] May rink.
[983.60 → 985.04] That is not financial advice for me.
[988.48 → 989.00] Yeah.
[989.76 → 991.36] This is important right now.
[994.24 → 997.22] Why don't we do our headline topic next.
[997.50 → 998.86] Microsoft is.
[999.08 → 1000.16] This is such a.
[1000.16 → 1002.28] This is such a corporate way to say this.
[1002.28 → 1003.72] Lowering.
[1004.14 → 1005.54] Its growth targets.
[1007.04 → 1008.36] For co-pilot.
[1009.72 → 1010.56] As it has.
[1010.72 → 1011.56] And this is a quote.
[1011.64 → 1012.24] This is amazing.
[1012.96 → 1015.86] Struggled to find buyers interested in using it.
[1017.02 → 1017.46] Yeah.
[1017.46 → 1020.98] This is according to a story from The Information.
[1021.54 → 1026.12] Which has resulted in a two and a half percent stock price drop on Wednesday.
[1026.50 → 1028.56] I mean you can never quite attribute.
[1028.84 → 1029.16] No.
[1029.24 → 1031.44] Like a share move to.
[1031.68 → 1033.16] You know one piece of news.
[1033.50 → 1034.92] Honestly I would have expected more.
[1035.58 → 1035.90] Well.
[1035.90 → 1036.78] Not financial advice.
[1037.24 → 1037.96] I mean.
[1038.10 → 1038.54] Based on.
[1038.68 → 1039.70] Based on how like.
[1040.10 → 1040.46] You know.
[1040.74 → 1043.08] Hyped the market is on AI stuff right now.
[1043.60 → 1044.22] Them being like.
[1044.34 → 1044.72] Uh yeah.
[1044.78 → 1045.34] It's failing.
[1045.88 → 1047.04] And then the market was like.
[1047.04 → 1047.48] Okay.
[1047.96 → 1048.34] Well.
[1048.46 → 1048.72] I mean.
[1048.74 → 1049.60] Here's the thing right.
[1049.68 → 1049.90] There's.
[1049.98 → 1051.20] There's a ton of inertia.
[1051.70 → 1052.44] In all of this.
[1052.78 → 1053.26] Like it's.
[1053.38 → 1053.92] Like I've been.
[1054.40 → 1054.88] I mean.
[1054.96 → 1056.24] Tesla just hit an all-time high.
[1056.60 → 1057.00] Okay.
[1057.22 → 1057.42] Right.
[1057.48 → 1057.96] So you have to.
[1058.12 → 1059.34] You have to remember that.
[1059.40 → 1059.70] Right.
[1060.44 → 1060.70] That.
[1061.28 → 1063.34] This kind of ties back perfectly.
[1063.34 → 1065.68] To that long conversation we had last week.
[1065.68 → 1067.10] About information bubbles.
[1067.54 → 1069.50] What percentage of people read.
[1069.62 → 1070.52] The information.
[1071.26 → 1072.06] And I don't mean.
[1072.22 → 1073.82] Any information in general.
[1074.08 → 1074.52] I mean.
[1075.40 → 1076.68] Theinformation.com.
[1077.04 → 1079.08] What percentage of people read this.
[1079.56 → 1081.28] What percentage of people who read it.
[1081.60 → 1082.34] Have a subscription.
[1082.60 → 1084.50] So they can read more than just the snippet.
[1084.68 → 1087.30] Who actually even knows about this.
[1087.52 → 1088.32] Not to mention.
[1088.48 → 1089.86] That so much of the investment.
[1090.28 → 1091.88] In things like the S&P.
[1092.30 → 1093.00] Are just.
[1094.20 → 1095.26] Are automated.
[1095.50 → 1097.06] Like people will literally set up their paycheck.
[1097.32 → 1097.72] To just.
[1098.08 → 1098.98] Siphon off some of it.
[1099.24 → 1099.68] And just.
[1099.80 → 1100.04] You know.
[1100.10 → 1101.28] Dump it into their portfolio.
[1101.28 → 1103.24] These are not decisions that they're making.
[1103.24 → 1104.62] Based on an article they read today.
[1104.72 → 1105.58] And they shouldn't.
[1105.70 → 1107.24] That actually is financial advice.
[1107.40 → 1108.98] You should not be just like.
[1109.70 → 1110.42] Every day.
[1110.60 → 1110.76] Nope.
[1110.76 → 1111.36] Moving around.
[1111.68 → 1113.78] It's still technically not financial advice.
[1113.80 → 1114.22] It is still.
[1114.66 → 1115.02] But.
[1115.14 → 1117.50] It is financial advice that I've received.
[1118.06 → 1118.50] Uh.
[1118.60 → 1118.84] Sure.
[1118.90 → 1119.02] I think that's fine.
[1119.02 → 1120.10] That the average person.
[1120.48 → 1120.92] Should not.
[1121.12 → 1121.88] Be just like.
[1121.92 → 1122.12] Yeah.
[1122.92 → 1124.34] Micromanaging their stock portfolio.
[1124.34 → 1125.10] From day to day.
[1125.18 → 1125.80] Based on.
[1126.20 → 1126.42] You know.
[1126.50 → 1127.78] Individual pieces of news.
[1127.78 → 1128.80] Um.
[1128.88 → 1130.66] Is not financial advice that we're giving you.
[1130.74 → 1131.04] Correct.
[1131.16 → 1131.62] But it is.
[1131.90 → 1133.22] Financial advice that I've received.
[1133.22 → 1135.36] From people who are qualified to give financial advice.
[1135.44 → 1136.62] So make of that what you will.
[1136.86 → 1137.12] Yeah.
[1137.36 → 1138.26] I think that's fine.
[1138.90 → 1139.28] So.
[1139.78 → 1141.04] So most people.
[1141.40 → 1142.42] Are not doing that.
[1142.64 → 1142.82] True.
[1142.82 → 1142.84] Like.
[1142.96 → 1144.44] You look at like a pension fund.
[1144.82 → 1145.46] For instance.
[1145.80 → 1146.02] Yeah.
[1146.02 → 1146.52] Where they have.
[1146.88 → 1149.34] Tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1149.34 → 1150.10] That they're managing.
[1150.14 → 1151.22] Or billions of dollars.
[1151.34 → 1152.02] That they're managing.
[1152.44 → 1153.70] You can't just.
[1154.28 → 1155.38] You can't just sell.
[1155.80 → 1157.76] A 400 million dollar stake.
[1158.16 → 1159.04] In Microsoft.
[1159.44 → 1159.92] Just like that.
[1159.96 → 1160.10] I mean.
[1160.14 → 1160.66] You can.
[1160.80 → 1162.32] You might not get the best price for it.
[1162.42 → 1162.86] Necessarily.
[1163.50 → 1163.90] Actually.
[1164.00 → 1165.12] Microsoft could, probably.
[1165.60 → 1166.22] Absorb that.
[1167.00 → 1167.22] Much.
[1167.38 → 1167.52] Yeah.
[1167.58 → 1168.92] Microsoft could probably absorb that much.
[1168.96 → 1170.26] But depending on the size of the company.
[1170.34 → 1170.54] Right.
[1170.54 → 1171.46] For every.
[1171.64 → 1172.72] Sale of a share.
[1172.86 → 1174.72] There has to be a purchase of a share.
[1175.18 → 1175.62] I just.
[1175.78 → 1177.68] I take every opportunity to talk about.
[1177.80 → 1179.12] The Toronto Teachers Pension Fund.
[1179.84 → 1180.44] Uh.
[1180.48 → 1181.34] Currently sitting at.
[1181.84 → 1184.18] 269.6 billion dollars in assets.
[1184.78 → 1185.58] Let's go.
[1186.20 → 1186.64] Yep.
[1186.64 → 1187.86] Massive.
[1187.90 → 1188.10] Right.
[1188.30 → 1188.96] And so.
[1189.10 → 1190.52] So an entity like that.
[1190.96 → 1191.88] Isn't going to be just.
[1192.02 → 1193.12] Read this article.
[1193.12 → 1193.80] And be like.
[1193.96 → 1194.20] Yeet.
[1194.24 → 1195.26] We're completely out of Microsoft.
[1195.40 → 1195.58] Sell.
[1195.66 → 1195.84] Sell.
[1195.94 → 1196.18] Sell.
[1196.30 → 1196.52] Sell.
[1196.52 → 1197.90] All the Microsoft immediately.
[1197.90 → 1198.26] Yeah.
[1198.26 → 1198.62] And you.
[1198.68 → 1199.70] And you have to have.
[1199.98 → 1200.92] Especially a company.
[1200.92 → 1202.44] With the market cap of Microsoft.
[1202.44 → 1203.40] You would have to have a.
[1203.96 → 1204.40] Huge.
[1205.06 → 1205.46] Huge.
[1205.46 → 1206.76] Huge volume of transactions.
[1207.08 → 1208.30] In order for the price.
[1208.42 → 1209.80] To really appreciably.
[1210.64 → 1211.08] Nosedive.
[1211.54 → 1212.22] Which isn't to say.
[1212.28 → 1212.98] It never happens.
[1212.98 → 1214.42] Or that it won't happen.
[1214.42 → 1215.20] When the AI bubbles.
[1215.20 → 1216.28] Really like pop pops.
[1216.92 → 1217.06] But.
[1217.56 → 1218.20] Two and a half percent.
[1218.30 → 1218.72] In a day.
[1218.84 → 1219.12] Is.
[1219.32 → 1219.72] Is a.
[1219.82 → 1220.36] Is a lot.
[1221.00 → 1221.40] Um.
[1222.40 → 1222.88] Anywho.
[1223.44 → 1224.00] What were we.
[1224.10 → 1225.08] What were we talking about again?
[1225.70 → 1226.14] Right.
[1226.20 → 1226.32] Yeah.
[1226.32 → 1226.96] Two and a half percent.
[1227.08 → 1227.86] Stock drop on Wednesday.
[1228.36 → 1228.72] Um.
[1228.96 → 1229.42] Copilot.
[1229.56 → 1230.10] Currently holds.
[1230.10 → 1231.02] 14 percent.
[1231.30 → 1232.12] AI market share.
[1232.24 → 1232.54] Apparently.
[1232.54 → 1233.98] With Google's Gemini.
[1234.20 → 1235.62] Less than one percent behind.
[1236.20 → 1236.66] Um.
[1237.04 → 1237.50] This.
[1237.70 → 1238.06] This.
[1239.18 → 1239.74] Deeply.
[1240.02 → 1241.34] Depends on how you measure.
[1241.54 → 1241.76] Oh yeah.
[1241.76 → 1242.36] Market share.
[1242.80 → 1243.16] Oh yeah.
[1243.16 → 1243.40] Uh.
[1243.48 → 1244.56] And based on.
[1244.82 → 1245.72] Tiny factors.
[1245.72 → 1246.50] Could swing.
[1247.12 → 1248.00] Massive amounts.
[1248.48 → 1248.70] Just.
[1248.86 → 1249.58] Just to like.
[1249.68 → 1250.44] Be super clear.
[1251.20 → 1251.68] Apparently.
[1251.86 → 1252.62] A big part.
[1252.74 → 1253.06] Of the.
[1253.10 → 1253.70] The sales.
[1253.96 → 1254.20] Uh.
[1254.20 → 1254.68] Struggles.
[1255.06 → 1255.48] Is that.
[1255.58 → 1256.52] AI agents.
[1256.74 → 1257.74] Being sold to businesses.
[1257.74 → 1258.88] As labour replacements.
[1258.88 → 1259.72] Are failing.
[1259.86 → 1260.30] To complete.
[1260.38 → 1261.46] Real world office tasks.
[1262.12 → 1262.94] 70 percent.
[1262.94 → 1263.54] Of the time.
[1263.70 → 1264.60] According to researchers.
[1264.60 → 1265.96] At Carnegie Mellon University.
[1266.06 → 1266.28] Honestly.
[1266.34 → 1266.78] I'm surprised.
[1267.08 → 1267.64] They're successful.
[1267.76 → 1268.18] 30 percent.
[1268.18 → 1268.60] Of the time.
[1268.76 → 1269.08] I suspect.
[1269.34 → 1270.08] That is again.
[1270.26 → 1271.42] How you measure it.
[1271.64 → 1272.16] And also.
[1272.58 → 1273.14] Pub factor.
[1273.60 → 1273.94] And.
[1274.46 → 1275.42] Lack of reporting.
[1275.66 → 1276.04] And stuff.
[1276.14 → 1276.82] Because it's like.
[1276.92 → 1277.28] For sure.
[1277.40 → 1278.00] Higher than that.
[1278.14 → 1278.30] But.
[1279.26 → 1279.68] Yeah.
[1282.10 → 1282.54] Cool.
[1282.94 → 1283.80] Or there are companies.
[1283.80 → 1284.34] That are like.
[1284.56 → 1285.92] Accepting a certain amount of.
[1286.38 → 1286.74] Like it's.
[1286.86 → 1287.22] Okay.
[1287.82 → 1288.54] Doesn't seem like.
[1288.54 → 1289.00] It's actually.
[1289.00 → 1289.96] Replacing the person.
[1290.20 → 1290.78] But we can, maybe.
[1290.96 → 1291.72] Accelerate some people.
[1291.88 → 1292.12] This way.
[1292.18 → 1292.64] So we're not going to.
[1292.72 → 1293.34] Report it as a failure.
[1293.34 → 1293.76] Anyway.
[1293.94 → 1295.02] Like stuff like that.
[1295.40 → 1295.82] Um.
[1296.50 → 1296.76] Yeah.
[1296.96 → 1298.10] Microsoft defended.
[1298.22 → 1298.62] Copilot.
[1298.76 → 1299.40] Claiming that.
[1299.90 → 1300.96] The information story.
[1301.30 → 1301.74] Inaccurately.
[1301.90 → 1302.84] Combines the concepts.
[1302.84 → 1303.50] Of growth.
[1303.68 → 1304.50] And sales quotas.
[1304.76 → 1305.12] And.
[1305.34 → 1305.94] They said that.
[1306.32 → 1307.34] Aggregate sales quotas.
[1307.34 → 1308.00] For AI products.
[1308.00 → 1309.08] Have not been lowered.
[1309.24 → 1309.98] Before you keep going.
[1310.14 → 1310.84] Another thing I would say.
[1310.84 → 1311.92] About that 70 percent figure.
[1312.06 → 1313.10] Is I bet you.
[1313.18 → 1313.70] There are cases.
[1313.70 → 1314.66] Where they are happy.
[1314.66 → 1315.46] That they're not working.
[1315.46 → 1315.88] As well.
[1315.88 → 1318.10] I could.
[1318.16 → 1318.72] I could see.
[1318.82 → 1320.04] I was just talking earlier.
[1320.04 → 1320.76] About how like.
[1321.36 → 1321.80] Uh.
[1322.00 → 1322.20] They are.
[1322.34 → 1322.78] In the.
[1322.86 → 1323.50] In the pre-show.
[1323.58 → 1324.28] Someone brought up.
[1324.34 → 1324.64] Oh.
[1324.72 → 1325.10] My like.
[1325.16 → 1326.28] Username that I changed.
[1326.52 → 1327.70] Didn't reflect the change.
[1327.84 → 1328.48] In full plane chat.
[1328.54 → 1329.04] For some reason.
[1329.34 → 1329.86] And I was like.
[1329.90 → 1330.12] Okay.
[1330.12 → 1330.40] Cool.
[1330.66 → 1331.48] Send in a report.
[1331.70 → 1332.02] Uh.
[1332.02 → 1332.72] A support ticket.
[1332.88 → 1333.86] We're not one of those companies.
[1333.86 → 1334.38] That try to like.
[1334.50 → 1335.06] Obfuscate it.
[1335.06 → 1336.06] Or make it harder to do.
[1336.06 → 1336.56] By like.
[1336.62 → 1337.08] Making you read.
[1337.22 → 1337.96] FAQ articles.
[1337.96 → 1338.32] And stuff.
[1338.48 → 1338.60] Yeah.
[1338.60 → 1339.48] They might like.
[1339.82 → 1341.04] That their support chatbots.
[1341.26 → 1341.64] Are bad.
[1343.26 → 1344.02] Interesting idea.
[1344.16 → 1345.34] I've never really thought about this before.
[1346.66 → 1347.82] I wonder if it's genuine.
[1347.90 → 1348.54] Because there's like.
[1348.66 → 1349.84] A ton of dark patterns.
[1350.12 → 1351.00] At various companies.
[1351.38 → 1352.44] That get put in place.
[1352.50 → 1353.90] To stop you from, actually.
[1354.10 → 1355.54] Properly sending in support tickets.
[1355.78 → 1356.12] Oh yeah.
[1356.12 → 1356.74] A hundred percent.
[1357.36 → 1358.46] Because every support ticket.
[1358.62 → 1359.44] Costs money.
[1360.18 → 1360.72] And every.
[1361.08 → 1361.98] Serving you a website.
[1362.18 → 1362.66] Web page.
[1362.78 → 1362.80] If it's like.
[1362.80 → 1362.88] Successful.
[1363.24 → 1364.12] You get a refund.
[1364.22 → 1364.86] Or a new product.
[1364.86 → 1365.32] Or something.
[1365.62 → 1365.84] Yeah.
[1365.84 → 1368.60] Like they don't actually want those to go through.
[1368.72 → 1369.46] In a lot of cases.
[1370.08 → 1370.14] Right.
[1370.32 → 1370.50] Not.
[1370.62 → 1371.46] Definitely not all.
[1371.72 → 1371.94] Right.
[1372.08 → 1372.54] Obviously.
[1372.90 → 1373.32] But like.
[1373.64 → 1375.08] There are definitely some.
[1375.78 → 1376.62] So if it's like.
[1377.14 → 1377.62] Bad.
[1377.86 → 1378.32] And it just.
[1378.58 → 1379.48] Results in people.
[1379.68 → 1381.18] Not being willing to go through the process.
[1381.18 → 1382.24] And they just give up.
[1382.50 → 1383.60] And that shows up.
[1383.66 → 1384.90] In some reporting dashboard.
[1385.36 → 1385.98] As like.
[1386.06 → 1386.22] Oh.
[1386.32 → 1388.10] We set up this AI bot.
[1388.40 → 1389.32] And our.
[1389.68 → 1390.16] Expenditure.
[1390.16 → 1391.44] On refunds.
[1391.58 → 1392.00] And.
[1392.50 → 1392.94] Replacements.
[1393.12 → 1393.72] Is lower.
[1394.62 → 1395.82] They'll see that as a success.
[1395.84 → 1398.52] I.
[1398.84 → 1399.82] I have no idea.
[1399.94 → 1401.10] This is a lot of like.
[1401.90 → 1403.50] I'm going to choose to believe.
[1403.50 → 1404.40] Conspiracy theory.
[1404.64 → 1405.76] That it's not that bad.
[1405.84 → 1406.36] At most places.
[1406.36 → 1406.76] Garbo time.
[1407.12 → 1408.12] I'm going to choose to believe.
[1408.22 → 1408.86] It's not that bad.
[1408.90 → 1409.56] In most cases.
[1409.80 → 1409.96] Sure.
[1410.00 → 1410.28] Just for now.
[1410.38 → 1411.34] Just for my own sanity.
[1411.50 → 1412.02] I'm going to choose.
[1412.16 → 1412.88] I have no idea.
[1412.98 → 1414.02] This is based on nothing.
[1415.12 → 1415.52] And.
[1415.52 → 1415.72] So.
[1415.72 → 1416.22] And.
[1416.36 → 1417.98] And my position is based on.
[1418.20 → 1419.20] Not being able to handle.
[1419.34 → 1420.18] The emotional burden.
[1420.64 → 1420.72] Of.
[1421.00 → 1422.10] You being correct.
[1422.22 → 1422.70] About this.
[1422.78 → 1423.48] Who knows.
[1424.08 → 1424.30] Okay.
[1424.30 → 1426.22] One of the ways that Microsoft is.
[1426.52 → 1428.40] Growing their AI business still though.
[1428.40 → 1429.72] Is by forcing.
[1430.36 → 1431.72] LG TV users.
[1432.12 → 1432.92] To have a shortcut.
[1433.24 → 1434.50] To copilot installed.
[1434.78 → 1436.24] On their smart TV home screen.
[1436.82 → 1437.70] They have, apparently.
[1438.10 → 1439.02] Since allowed users.
[1439.02 → 1440.00] To delete the shortcut.
[1440.44 → 1441.56] But there was a period.
[1441.56 → 1442.76] Where it was not possible.
[1442.76 → 1443.24] To delete.
[1443.48 → 1444.34] And the backlash.
[1444.34 → 1445.50] Was swift.
[1445.86 → 1446.64] And secure.
[1446.90 → 1448.14] Our discussion question is.
[1448.34 → 1449.76] Why would you want co-pilot.
[1449.94 → 1450.66] On your TV.
[1450.66 → 1452.74] Yeah.
[1452.78 → 1453.40] I don't.
[1453.84 → 1454.20] Extremely.
[1454.58 → 1454.92] Cold.
[1455.24 → 1455.52] Take.
[1455.74 → 1455.92] But.
[1456.16 → 1456.34] Man.
[1456.42 → 1457.42] Smart TVs suck.
[1461.82 → 1462.22] Cool.
[1463.02 → 1463.38] Yeah.
[1463.40 → 1463.82] That was.
[1464.48 → 1465.22] That was pretty.
[1465.34 → 1466.00] That was pretty good.
[1467.22 → 1467.62] Actually.
[1467.72 → 1467.86] Oh.
[1467.94 → 1468.48] This is actually.
[1468.56 → 1469.04] This is a good.
[1469.12 → 1469.78] This is a good.
[1469.78 → 1470.72] Discussion question.
[1471.10 → 1471.76] David Gauthier.
[1471.76 → 1472.66] Compared to this topic.
[1472.66 → 1475.60] Is a bad TV UX.
[1475.94 → 1476.46] Enough.
[1476.84 → 1477.18] To.
[1478.22 → 1478.86] Persuade you.
[1478.92 → 1480.18] To buy a different brand.
[1480.68 → 1481.00] And.
[1481.14 → 1481.48] And.
[1481.64 → 1482.50] Follow-up question.
[1483.66 → 1484.02] For.
[1484.20 → 1484.88] Let's assume.
[1485.14 → 1485.96] An equal.
[1486.22 → 1487.24] Viewing experience.
[1488.02 → 1489.18] How much more.
[1489.32 → 1490.22] Would you spend.
[1490.86 → 1491.26] Ooh.
[1491.64 → 1492.16] Ooh.
[1493.20 → 1493.80] Ooh.
[1494.50 → 1495.60] I do think.
[1495.70 → 1496.28] A bad.
[1497.02 → 1497.50] UX.
[1497.62 → 1498.30] Could push me away.
[1498.30 → 1498.90] From buying.
[1499.08 → 1499.84] A certain TV.
[1500.50 → 1501.04] Um.
[1501.04 → 1502.98] But the last TV upgrade.
[1502.98 → 1503.66] That.
[1504.14 → 1504.70] Was done.
[1504.88 → 1505.74] For my dad.
[1506.32 → 1507.24] We looked for one.
[1507.34 → 1508.20] That on purpose.
[1509.30 → 1509.80] Uh.
[1509.82 → 1510.48] Was like.
[1510.56 → 1511.68] As dumb as possible.
[1512.52 → 1513.08] Um.
[1514.92 → 1515.48] The.
[1515.74 → 1516.66] How much is enough.
[1516.86 → 1517.18] Is.
[1517.34 → 1518.06] A tough one.
[1518.30 → 1519.20] I don't know.
[1520.20 → 1521.14] I really.
[1521.14 → 1521.86] Don't know.
[1525.52 → 1526.54] While you think.
[1526.76 → 1527.66] Metal Max scene.
[1527.78 → 1528.74] Had one idea.
[1529.42 → 1529.64] Hey.
[1529.72 → 1530.14] Co-pilot.
[1530.28 → 1531.02] Is this the episode.
[1531.02 → 1532.14] I watched last week.
[1532.20 → 1533.24] Or is it just another scene.
[1533.24 → 1534.52] Of Abby and Mickey.
[1534.80 → 1535.22] Hacking.
[1536.40 → 1536.82] Um.
[1537.74 → 1538.40] I guess.
[1538.50 → 1539.60] If you wanted to ask it.
[1539.68 → 1540.58] Questions about content.
[1540.64 → 1541.10] But it's like.
[1541.60 → 1542.04] I don't know.
[1542.18 → 1542.54] See.
[1542.62 → 1543.60] I have the same issue.
[1543.60 → 1544.12] With this.
[1544.50 → 1545.70] That I have with like.
[1546.16 → 1546.82] A wearable.
[1546.94 → 1547.82] AI companion.
[1548.48 → 1548.96] And.
[1549.30 → 1549.72] You know.
[1549.90 → 1551.14] An AI ring.
[1551.30 → 1552.74] And an AI glasses.
[1553.02 → 1553.44] And an AI.
[1553.44 → 1554.44] I already.
[1555.64 → 1556.06] Have.
[1556.28 → 1557.50] A phone in my pocket.
[1557.72 → 1558.22] You have all the answers you need.
[1558.22 → 1558.86] I literally.
[1559.10 → 1559.94] Already have it.
[1559.94 → 1560.82] It's also going to be wrong.
[1560.92 → 1561.28] Often.
[1561.60 → 1562.20] We did the.
[1562.20 → 1562.56] Uh.
[1562.62 → 1563.44] The full point exclusive.
[1563.44 → 1564.28] That is out now.
[1564.56 → 1565.06] Uh.
[1565.14 → 1566.56] The last one from Luke Week.
[1566.60 → 1567.40] Which is a gaming video.
[1567.84 → 1568.32] Um.
[1568.32 → 1568.76] And.
[1569.12 → 1570.52] When I was looking over some of the.
[1570.58 → 1570.78] Like.
[1570.84 → 1571.48] B-roll footage.
[1571.62 → 1572.58] I was sending to Sammy.
[1572.88 → 1573.06] Yeah.
[1573.16 → 1573.64] Uh.
[1573.80 → 1575.46] Gem and I just did a summary.
[1575.66 → 1576.44] Without me asking.
[1576.94 → 1577.34] Of.
[1577.64 → 1578.36] Some of the footage.
[1578.36 → 1579.46] That I had put in Google Drive.
[1579.76 → 1580.58] And it is like.
[1580.94 → 1581.80] Summarized a bunch of.
[1581.88 → 1583.02] Gameplay footage that I had.
[1583.28 → 1584.32] And it had like.
[1584.68 → 1585.40] My mic.
[1585.84 → 1587.44] And the person I was playing with.
[1587.66 → 1588.02] Mic.
[1588.18 → 1588.88] In the recording.
[1589.10 → 1590.08] So it tried to summarize.
[1590.08 → 1591.32] Like the things that happened.
[1591.42 → 1592.68] And what we said about it.
[1592.68 → 1593.52] And it was like.
[1594.16 → 1595.48] 70% correct.
[1595.90 → 1597.42] And 30% of it was just.
[1598.54 → 1599.70] Totally made up.
[1600.62 → 1602.38] And that's going to happen here.
[1603.00 → 1603.92] Like it was just.
[1604.08 → 1605.26] I was reading different parts.
[1605.36 → 1605.94] I was like wow.
[1606.06 → 1606.22] That.
[1606.74 → 1607.62] Never happened.
[1608.00 → 1608.34] Neat.
[1608.68 → 1609.10] Uh.
[1609.64 → 1610.02] Yeah.
[1611.02 → 1612.32] Dyslexic stoner asks.
[1613.16 → 1615.04] What if my AI on my TV.
[1615.04 → 1616.78] Could put swear words back in.
[1617.00 → 1617.70] Instead of bleeps.
[1617.96 → 1620.22] I would give away all my info for that.
[1622.68 → 1624.34] No now you're just.
[1624.48 → 1625.64] You're just imagining.
[1625.92 → 1627.36] Too useful of a function for AI.
[1627.56 → 1627.78] Okay.
[1627.94 → 1628.18] Oh.
[1628.46 → 1630.18] Oh this was such a great example.
[1630.54 → 1632.00] Sancho but with real swears.
[1632.20 → 1633.84] All of this stuff is just.
[1634.10 → 1634.68] S*** still.
[1635.10 → 1635.66] And I just.
[1636.10 → 1637.58] How many years ago was it.
[1637.74 → 1638.96] That Google did that demo.
[1639.20 → 1640.36] Where your AI assistant.
[1640.64 → 1641.62] And this is pre like.
[1641.80 → 1643.38] The generative AI LLM thing.
[1643.66 → 1644.68] Where your AI assistant.
[1644.68 → 1645.40] Was supposed to.
[1645.50 → 1646.68] To phone your hairdresser.
[1646.68 → 1647.86] And make an appointment for you.
[1647.88 → 1648.70] That was so long ago.
[1648.80 → 1649.40] That was like.
[1649.98 → 1651.12] A billion years ago.
[1651.12 → 1652.90] I think at least like seven.
[1653.12 → 1653.56] I think.
[1653.70 → 1654.40] I think it was something.
[1654.48 → 1654.74] I think.
[1654.82 → 1655.68] I think you're probably right.
[1655.74 → 1656.24] I think it was like.
[1656.30 → 1657.48] Six to eight years ago.
[1657.54 → 1658.22] Or something like that.
[1658.84 → 1659.22] And.
[1659.48 → 1660.88] I basically was like.
[1662.96 → 1663.40] Cap.
[1664.24 → 1664.50] Because.
[1664.96 → 1665.74] Like it's just.
[1666.60 → 1666.96] Obviously.
[1668.30 → 1669.28] Six to seven.
[1670.08 → 1670.76] Very funny.
[1671.80 → 1672.16] Because.
[1672.42 → 1673.10] Because it's just.
[1673.22 → 1673.38] It's.
[1673.38 → 1674.48] It's, obviously.
[1674.86 → 1675.64] The kind of thing.
[1675.86 → 1676.56] That would work.
[1676.96 → 1678.58] But would work so poorly.
[1678.58 → 1680.32] That it's actually more work.
[1680.78 → 1681.58] Than just.
[1681.86 → 1682.64] Calling your hairdresser.
[1682.78 → 1683.40] And making an appointment.
[1683.62 → 1684.88] And looking at the calendar yourself.
[1685.02 → 1685.24] Right.
[1687.08 → 1688.42] I had another.
[1689.16 → 1689.56] Prime.
[1689.70 → 1689.84] Wow.
[1689.88 → 1690.54] You nailed it.
[1690.60 → 1691.14] May 2018.
[1691.36 → 1691.62] Apparently.
[1692.02 → 1693.32] Says Andy in the UK.
[1693.76 → 1694.14] Boom.
[1694.48 → 1694.86] Nice.
[1695.22 → 1695.54] Um.
[1696.26 → 1697.20] I had yet.
[1697.30 → 1698.38] Another one of those moments.
[1698.38 → 1699.24] Because I looked at that.
[1699.30 → 1699.60] And I went.
[1700.58 → 1701.66] My assistant.
[1702.04 → 1702.22] Can.
[1702.40 → 1703.70] Can barely figure out.
[1703.82 → 1704.08] Like.
[1704.72 → 1705.42] If I mean.
[1705.42 → 1706.34] A local address.
[1706.34 → 1707.98] Or I mean one in New Brunswick.
[1708.10 → 1708.42] My assistant.
[1708.42 → 1710.10] When I asked to navigate somewhere.
[1710.26 → 1710.46] Like.
[1710.68 → 1711.74] You have to be kidding me.
[1711.82 → 1713.76] My assistant is purely for setting alarms.
[1713.94 → 1714.06] Yeah.
[1714.36 → 1714.72] Or.
[1715.08 → 1715.26] Um.
[1716.28 → 1716.54] Right.
[1716.64 → 1717.06] Shazam.
[1717.50 → 1717.70] Like.
[1717.80 → 1718.26] My assistant.
[1718.50 → 1718.98] My assistant.
[1719.10 → 1719.72] At that time.
[1719.78 → 1721.06] You still couldn't set an alarm.
[1721.42 → 1722.32] Using Google Assistant.
[1722.32 → 1724.16] That was more than 24 hours in the future.
[1724.32 → 1724.52] Oh.
[1724.74 → 1725.30] Like you couldn't.
[1725.38 → 1725.94] Do you remember that?
[1726.02 → 1726.16] Yeah.
[1726.16 → 1726.98] You couldn't set an alarm.
[1726.98 → 1728.30] For like two days from now.
[1729.00 → 1729.40] And.
[1729.56 → 1730.88] That's a big problem for me.
[1730.94 → 1732.02] Because a calendar event.
[1732.02 → 1732.96] Is not enough for me.
[1733.60 → 1734.18] Book book book book.
[1734.18 → 1734.54] Like.
[1734.82 → 1737.00] That's not enough for something I actually need to do.
[1737.08 → 1737.94] I need it to ring.
[1738.18 → 1738.34] Yep.
[1738.36 → 1739.36] When it's time for me to do something.
[1739.42 → 1740.56] How is that still.
[1740.90 → 1742.66] How is that still not a function?
[1742.86 → 1743.32] Don't break it.
[1743.32 → 1745.02] How is that still not a function?
[1745.02 → 1745.56] I fully agree.
[1746.00 → 1747.16] Because it's super annoying.
[1747.16 → 1748.46] Needing to just go do both.
[1748.54 → 1750.62] And you should really be able to make a calendar event.
[1750.70 → 1751.30] Send off an alarm.
[1752.00 → 1752.28] Yeah.
[1752.44 → 1753.10] You really should.
[1753.24 → 1753.52] Anyway.
[1753.60 → 1753.88] Anyway.
[1753.96 → 1754.18] Anyway.
[1754.26 → 1754.44] Anyway.
[1754.82 → 1756.18] Maybe there's a third party app.
[1756.20 → 1757.06] Which would be super cool.
[1757.06 → 1757.82] If anyone knows one.
[1757.90 → 1758.78] Feel free to pop it in the chat.
[1758.78 → 1759.22] Feature idea too.
[1759.32 → 1760.82] If you're in the Google ecosystem.
[1761.02 → 1763.10] Which kind of blows in a lot of ways right now.
[1763.10 → 1765.24] But you should make it so that it sets off an alarm.
[1765.42 → 1767.22] Unless you're like in the thing.
[1767.34 → 1768.80] So if you're in like a Google meet.
[1769.18 → 1770.54] That is in the calendar event.
[1770.88 → 1771.86] If you're in the thing.
[1771.98 → 1773.16] Just don't bother setting the alarm off.
[1773.18 → 1773.58] That'd be cool.
[1773.64 → 1774.32] But if you're not.
[1774.42 → 1775.88] Then it should like to get your attention.
[1776.00 → 1777.30] Until you get in the Google meet.
[1777.56 → 1778.30] That would be sick.
[1778.40 → 1780.76] Cosmic Wolf says Siri is still limited to 24 hours.
[1780.84 → 1780.94] Yeah.
[1781.02 → 1782.36] So I was about to talk about Siri.
[1782.74 → 1785.48] So Yvonne never got around to switching back to her Android phone.
[1785.48 → 1786.02] Just yet.
[1786.14 → 1788.12] Although iOS 26 has, actually.
[1788.44 → 1788.94] Might make her.
[1788.96 → 1790.78] Might make her go back.
[1790.78 → 1794.20] I have a video coming soon on my experience with iOS 26.
[1794.34 → 1795.38] But as far as I can tell.
[1795.56 → 1798.68] It's like the biggest pile that Apple has released.
[1798.86 → 1800.72] And that I'm aware of.
[1800.92 → 1802.18] That I remember ever using.
[1803.54 → 1803.94] Anyway.
[1804.56 → 1806.08] She went to use Siri last night.
[1806.54 → 1807.08] And she's like.
[1807.18 → 1807.68] Hey Siri.
[1807.92 → 1809.04] And I actually really like this.
[1809.10 → 1810.16] The way that Siri is just like.
[1810.32 → 1810.44] Hmm?
[1811.32 → 1812.20] Instead of being like.
[1812.96 → 1813.36] Yes.
[1813.44 → 1813.68] Hello.
[1813.82 → 1814.68] What can I do for you?
[1814.74 → 1815.28] Shut up.
[1815.46 → 1816.54] I'm the one who talks.
[1816.62 → 1817.22] I'm the human.
[1817.32 → 1818.12] You are the flanker.
[1818.12 → 1818.68] You know.
[1820.90 → 1821.26] Anyway.
[1821.46 → 1822.04] I kind of like you too.
[1822.20 → 1822.48] She goes.
[1822.54 → 1822.78] She goes.
[1822.98 → 1823.94] Hey Siri.
[1824.36 → 1824.50] Hmm?
[1825.86 → 1827.28] Set a couple of reminders for me.
[1828.08 → 1828.56] I want to.
[1830.08 → 1830.44] Sorry.
[1830.60 → 1831.54] I can't do that.
[1832.26 → 1832.84] Why not?
[1833.68 → 1835.34] I thought that's the whole point.
[1835.48 → 1837.04] Of natural language interaction.
[1837.20 → 1837.88] Why do I have to.
[1838.34 → 1838.88] Hey Siri.
[1839.24 → 1839.40] Hmm?
[1839.86 → 1840.62] Set a reminder.
[1841.02 → 1841.62] I need to do.
[1841.78 → 1843.06] Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[1843.80 → 1844.18] Okay.
[1844.30 → 1844.52] Blah blah.
[1844.60 → 1844.74] No.
[1844.82 → 1845.16] Shut up.
[1845.24 → 1845.50] Shut up.
[1845.90 → 1846.50] Hey Siri.
[1846.50 → 1847.74] Hmm?
[1848.56 → 1849.22] Set a reminder.
[1849.46 → 1849.76] I need to.
[1849.96 → 1850.32] No.
[1850.50 → 1851.36] Just let me do both of them.
[1851.42 → 1852.38] And until.
[1852.56 → 1853.22] Oh I'm so sorry.
[1853.28 → 1854.14] I'm setting off people's phones.
[1854.26 → 1854.56] My bad.
[1857.50 → 1858.60] Stop saying the S word.
[1861.02 → 1861.38] Yeah.
[1861.96 → 1863.06] I screwed up.
[1863.32 → 1863.70] I'm sorry.
[1864.54 → 1864.94] The point.
[1865.10 → 1865.30] Yeah.
[1865.36 → 1865.56] Sorry.
[1865.64 → 1867.08] I can't show you that while driving.
[1867.22 → 1867.54] It's like.
[1867.68 → 1867.88] Bro.
[1867.96 → 1868.26] I'm not.
[1868.34 → 1869.06] I'm not driving.
[1869.06 → 1870.32] I'm in the passenger seat.
[1870.46 → 1872.54] And I'm plugged into the car play.
[1872.84 → 1874.14] That stuff is so annoying.
[1874.40 → 1874.76] So just.
[1875.22 → 1875.94] Thank you.
[1875.94 → 1876.50] Nanny.
[1876.74 → 1876.90] But.
[1877.24 → 1878.12] F*** off.
[1878.72 → 1881.80] I'm not interested in having you take care of me.
[1881.88 → 1883.90] And what I'm allowed to do while I'm doing things.
[1883.98 → 1885.66] You know a game that I'm surprised doesn't exist.
[1885.94 → 1886.08] Yeah.
[1886.14 → 1890.64] You know when we were growing up and like everyone just universally played the like raindrop game.
[1890.64 → 1892.78] Where like the.
[1893.08 → 1893.48] You know when.
[1893.48 → 1894.90] When condensation is like.
[1895.00 → 1895.18] Yeah.
[1895.18 → 1895.26] Yeah.
[1895.26 → 1895.46] Yeah.
[1895.46 → 1895.48] Yeah.
[1895.48 → 1895.58] Yeah.
[1895.58 → 1896.06] Yeah.
[1896.06 → 1896.92] And you like track how it goes.
[1897.04 → 1897.16] Yeah.
[1897.30 → 1897.58] Or.
[1897.72 → 1900.14] Did you play the variant where you find a spot on the windshield?
[1900.28 → 1900.48] Yes.
[1900.52 → 1901.96] And you move around your head to dodge everything?
[1902.24 → 1902.30] Yeah.
[1902.30 → 1903.48] That was my favourite one.
[1903.56 → 1903.70] Yeah.
[1903.74 → 1905.46] But everyone talks about the raindrop game.
[1905.50 → 1907.28] I thought that one was way cooler.
[1907.38 → 1907.56] Oh yeah.
[1907.58 → 1907.96] But anyway.
[1907.96 → 1909.08] We all used to do this.
[1909.20 → 1911.22] I'm surprised those don't exist as like.
[1911.58 → 1911.94] Basically.
[1912.36 → 1912.66] Games.
[1913.64 → 1914.14] Oh yeah.
[1914.14 → 1916.70] There'd be no reason you couldn't do it with like head tracking.
[1916.92 → 1917.08] Yeah.
[1918.04 → 1918.98] It's got to be a thing.
[1919.62 → 1921.26] It's got to be like a genre of games.
[1921.26 → 1921.28] Yeah.
[1921.28 → 1922.14] Maybe I just don't know about it.
[1922.66 → 1924.92] It seems like it would actually be like pretty fun.
[1925.40 → 1925.84] Oh dude.
[1925.88 → 1927.70] You could do it in VR like super easy I think.
[1928.90 → 1929.16] Yeah.
[1929.24 → 1929.96] I mean would you even.
[1930.28 → 1932.04] You wouldn't even need VR for it though.
[1932.04 → 1932.14] No.
[1932.14 → 1932.24] No.
[1932.34 → 1935.30] But like I'm just saying to skip a lot of the like steps.
[1935.52 → 1936.56] It should be not that hard.
[1937.02 → 1937.64] I think.
[1938.22 → 1939.80] But I don't know much about game development so.
[1940.66 → 1943.92] William Comartin says I used to try to name the make and model.
[1943.92 → 1945.38] Based on the headlight shape at night.
[1946.34 → 1947.06] That's pretty cool.
[1947.12 → 1947.72] That's tough.
[1947.92 → 1948.18] Yeah.
[1948.86 → 1949.74] That's pretty tough.
[1949.82 → 1951.60] That's a lot more knowledge than I would have had.
[1951.96 → 1952.32] Yeah.
[1954.40 → 1955.44] And with my eyes.
[1955.56 → 1957.20] I'm not making out a headlight shape dude.
[1957.70 → 1958.44] I'm just getting.
[1960.96 → 1963.22] Web Dude says for reminders and alarms on Android.
[1963.22 → 1968.92] There's an app a calendar which can handle about five alarms slash reminders with noise or email.
[1969.48 → 1970.46] Why is it five?
[1970.74 → 1971.34] I don't know.
[1971.42 → 1973.70] Maybe it's just maybe it's just not quite.
[1973.92 → 1974.30] Um.
[1974.36 → 1975.22] Explained properly.
[1975.88 → 1976.20] Um.
[1976.30 → 1976.58] Anyway.
[1976.68 → 1976.80] Yeah.
[1976.84 → 1978.38] We can explore that another time.
[1978.62 → 1980.22] I just switched over to the Fold 7.
[1980.32 → 1982.04] Unfortunately this is not the new Trifold.
[1982.36 → 1984.70] And it took a grand total of one day.
[1985.08 → 1985.46] Oh yeah.
[1985.46 → 1985.78] For it to not.
[1986.18 → 1987.52] Fold completely flat.
[1987.62 → 1987.94] Yep.
[1987.94 → 1990.80] So I need to add that to my notes.
[1992.28 → 1992.52] Oh.
[1993.52 → 1993.88] Ugh.
[1994.16 → 1994.86] I want.
[1995.66 → 1996.12] You know what?
[1996.18 → 1996.70] Overall.
[1997.06 → 2000.70] I still am really, really loving it a lot so far.
[2001.36 → 2001.92] Um.
[2002.56 → 2003.56] Took one day.
[2003.56 → 2008.54] Do need to be overwent to be flat.
[2009.12 → 2009.42] Uh.
[2009.50 → 2009.78] It's.
[2009.78 → 2010.34] It's like.
[2010.90 → 2011.28] Dude.
[2011.36 → 2013.54] I haven't daily driven a Fold in years now.
[2013.68 → 2014.56] And it's like.
[2015.36 → 2018.66] It's like going back into the warm embrace of an old friend honestly.
[2018.86 → 2019.12] Really?
[2019.30 → 2019.54] Yeah.
[2019.54 → 2021.04] I had a Teams meeting today.
[2021.16 → 2021.46] Whoa.
[2021.62 → 2022.96] That they were screen sharing on.
[2023.66 → 2026.78] So I had a giant thing that I could read text on.
[2027.10 → 2027.72] And I was like.
[2027.76 → 2028.06] Oh yeah.
[2028.74 → 2028.96] Yeah.
[2029.04 → 2030.38] I remember why this was.
[2031.00 → 2032.86] Way better than literally anything else.
[2033.54 → 2033.56] Um.
[2033.64 → 2033.86] Huh.
[2034.22 → 2035.36] And it's not for everybody.
[2035.94 → 2036.12] Right?
[2036.18 → 2039.40] Like the battery life is going to be a bit of a downer for some people.
[2039.76 → 2040.12] Um.
[2040.32 → 2041.12] Although with that said.
[2041.20 → 2042.62] I'm sitting at 97% today.
[2042.72 → 2044.48] But I did plug in on my way into work.
[2044.54 → 2045.42] So make of that what you will.
[2046.50 → 2046.90] Um.
[2047.92 → 2048.48] But if.
[2048.60 → 2049.52] If your use case.
[2049.54 → 2051.42] If your use case.
[2051.66 → 2052.70] Benefits from the Fold.
[2052.84 → 2053.36] There's just.
[2054.12 → 2054.86] There's no question.
[2054.92 → 2056.96] I've already run into a weird thing.
[2057.08 → 2057.32] Uh.
[2057.34 → 2057.66] Plex.
[2058.18 → 2058.52] The.
[2058.66 → 2059.20] The interface.
[2059.56 → 2061.04] If you tap your.
[2061.34 → 2061.74] Um.
[2062.58 → 2063.02] Uh.
[2063.08 → 2063.22] Your.
[2063.30 → 2063.58] Like your.
[2063.68 → 2065.12] Your user icon at the top.
[2065.66 → 2066.02] Uh.
[2066.06 → 2066.34] In.
[2066.80 → 2067.70] Candy bar mode.
[2068.10 → 2069.24] It's supposed to.
[2069.62 → 2069.88] Uh.
[2069.88 → 2070.70] Do something.
[2070.88 → 2071.28] I forget.
[2071.72 → 2073.32] But in like the more tablet mode.
[2073.50 → 2074.86] It slides in a thing from the left.
[2075.10 → 2077.18] And it accidentally did the tablet thing.
[2077.18 → 2078.30] When I was in candy bar.
[2078.30 → 2078.80] Uh.
[2078.80 → 2080.50] So my screen was just going dark.
[2081.30 → 2084.18] Because I couldn't see that it was sliding a thing from off-screen.
[2084.42 → 2084.62] Yeah.
[2085.00 → 2085.64] So just.
[2087.10 → 2087.80] You know.
[2088.08 → 2088.58] That's annoying.
[2088.64 → 2089.58] It's still not perfect.
[2089.64 → 2090.06] I was going to say.
[2090.10 → 2091.54] I wonder if that's more on the phone.
[2093.00 → 2094.26] I feel like it should be reporting.
[2094.26 → 2095.26] It's the phone.
[2095.26 → 2096.14] It's the phone.
[2096.26 → 2097.04] It's the phone.
[2097.18 → 2097.58] It's Android.
[2097.78 → 2098.18] It's apps.
[2098.38 → 2098.46] It's.
[2098.54 → 2100.58] It's just the poor integration between all of them.
[2100.64 → 2100.74] Yeah.
[2100.86 → 2101.04] Yeah.
[2101.62 → 2102.00] Um.
[2103.34 → 2104.20] It's a Plex problem.
[2104.28 → 2105.06] It's just a shitty app.
[2105.26 → 2105.46] Yeah.
[2105.72 → 2106.08] Yeah.
[2106.08 → 2106.16] Yeah.
[2106.16 → 2106.34] Sure.
[2106.46 → 2107.16] But that doesn't.
[2107.44 → 2109.02] And this is a take that I.
[2109.10 → 2109.66] I have.
[2109.88 → 2112.74] I have gone to war for a lot of times.
[2112.74 → 2114.96] And I will continue to go to war for.
[2115.44 → 2115.80] Um.
[2116.16 → 2116.76] It doesn't matter.
[2117.74 → 2118.18] Yeah.
[2118.18 → 2118.64] It's true.
[2119.00 → 2120.48] When at the end of the day.
[2120.62 → 2120.86] Right.
[2120.92 → 2122.76] When people choose a device.
[2122.76 → 2124.72] Whether they're choosing a candy bar Android.
[2125.08 → 2126.30] A folding Android.
[2126.60 → 2127.50] An iPhone.
[2127.86 → 2128.96] A Windows phone.
[2129.06 → 2129.64] I don't care.
[2129.82 → 2130.04] You know.
[2130.08 → 2131.74] Whatever it is that people are choosing.
[2132.78 → 2133.52] Just keep going.
[2133.78 → 2134.14] Um.
[2135.96 → 2138.56] What matters is the user experience.
[2139.06 → 2139.50] And so.
[2139.60 → 2139.76] You know.
[2139.76 → 2141.82] Back when I was on some of the early folds.
[2141.98 → 2143.64] And I couldn't use YouTube stories.
[2144.14 → 2145.34] I didn't care.
[2145.54 → 2146.96] If that was Samsung's fault.
[2146.96 → 2149.00] Or Google's fault.
[2149.46 → 2149.86] Or.
[2150.28 → 2151.54] Father Christmas's fault.
[2151.62 → 2152.92] It just didn't matter.
[2153.02 → 2154.34] What mattered was that device.
[2154.56 → 2156.58] Was not suitable for my use case.
[2157.90 → 2158.92] That's all that matters.
[2159.06 → 2159.20] Yeah.
[2159.36 → 2160.12] And so that's.
[2161.12 → 2161.42] And.
[2161.50 → 2162.56] And everyone else.
[2162.76 → 2163.64] I am the user.
[2163.82 → 2165.14] I am the one giving the money.
[2165.60 → 2166.58] To have this experience.
[2166.58 → 2168.44] And everyone else needs to accommodate.
[2168.72 → 2170.42] What I need to get done on my device.
[2170.82 → 2171.38] So like.
[2171.48 → 2171.72] You know.
[2171.72 → 2172.44] Let's look at.
[2173.08 → 2174.64] Elijah's actually working on a video.
[2175.26 → 2176.94] About his switch to iPhone.
[2177.52 → 2177.86] Which.
[2178.30 → 2179.06] Was made.
[2179.24 → 2179.96] Actually for.
[2180.50 → 2180.98] Predominantly.
[2181.56 → 2182.34] Contact sharing.
[2182.72 → 2183.44] Using AirDrop.
[2183.94 → 2184.34] Um.
[2184.34 → 2186.34] Because he went and was doing some networking at an event.
[2186.44 → 2188.10] And missed out on some perfect contacts.
[2188.20 → 2188.94] Because they were just like.
[2189.62 → 2189.98] Oh.
[2190.06 → 2191.24] I have to type something.
[2191.50 → 2192.56] You're a lesser being.
[2192.86 → 2193.26] Um.
[2193.54 → 2193.88] You know.
[2193.96 → 2194.14] Oh.
[2194.18 → 2195.48] That's way too much work.
[2195.54 → 2196.94] I only tap my phone with people.
[2196.94 → 2197.94] I only interface with highborn.
[2198.54 → 2198.88] Whatever.
[2199.10 → 2199.86] The point is.
[2199.92 → 2200.86] He missed out on some.
[2200.92 → 2201.84] He missed out on some.
[2201.94 → 2202.66] Some contacts.
[2202.78 → 2203.30] And so he was like.
[2203.34 → 2203.52] Okay.
[2203.52 → 2204.62] I'm just going to have to do it.
[2204.62 → 2205.30] Um.
[2205.40 → 2206.06] But over time.
[2206.18 → 2206.92] He's found there's.
[2207.02 → 2208.14] There are other benefits as well.
[2208.20 → 2209.18] And one of them is that.
[2209.48 → 2209.82] Um.
[2209.90 → 2210.26] For.
[2210.92 → 2211.36] Creative.
[2211.90 → 2212.86] Oriented apps.
[2213.18 → 2214.28] Sometimes they'll get.
[2214.60 → 2215.64] Cool new features.
[2215.94 → 2217.62] Before they're rolled out to other platforms.
[2218.32 → 2218.76] And.
[2218.76 → 2220.86] At the end of the day.
[2221.86 → 2223.62] Is that the fault of the app creator?
[2224.14 → 2225.96] Is that the fault of the.
[2226.30 → 2227.22] The phone maker?
[2227.64 → 2228.78] Is that the fault of the.
[2228.94 → 2229.76] Operating system.
[2230.12 → 2230.46] Owner.
[2230.60 → 2231.08] In this case.
[2231.14 → 2231.30] You know.
[2231.34 → 2231.64] Google.
[2232.68 → 2233.22] Doesn't matter.
[2233.40 → 2233.92] Why Elijah?
[2234.00 → 2234.30] He says.
[2234.44 → 2236.48] iPhone is so much better for creators.
[2236.62 → 2237.32] It's kind of scary.
[2237.50 → 2237.78] Why?
[2238.42 → 2239.16] What makes a difference?
[2239.28 → 2239.44] Uh.
[2239.44 → 2240.46] The thing I was talking about.
[2240.54 → 2241.36] That you weren't listening to.
[2241.44 → 2242.20] Because you were reading chat.
[2242.30 → 2242.56] Nice.
[2242.68 → 2242.88] Cool.
[2243.00 → 2243.64] I wasn't really.
[2243.64 → 2245.88] And he's going to do a full video about it.
[2245.88 → 2246.24] So.
[2246.98 → 2247.20] You know.
[2247.22 → 2248.10] He'll be talking through.
[2248.24 → 2248.88] A lot of this.
[2248.90 → 2248.92] Wait.
[2248.94 → 2249.72] The contact sharing?
[2250.06 → 2250.30] No.
[2250.36 → 2251.04] Not the contact sharing.
[2251.04 → 2251.14] Okay.
[2251.14 → 2251.78] You missed.
[2251.84 → 2252.84] You missed a whole other thing.
[2252.90 → 2253.48] That I was talking about.
[2253.58 → 2253.92] Just now.
[2254.06 → 2254.22] Alright.
[2254.32 → 2254.42] Alright.
[2256.62 → 2257.02] Um.
[2257.26 → 2257.58] Yes.
[2257.66 → 2259.12] We do need to do that.
[2261.54 → 2261.94] Oh.
[2261.94 → 2262.12] Yeah.
[2262.30 → 2262.52] Yeah.
[2262.76 → 2263.06] Oh.
[2263.06 → 2263.42] Is it.
[2263.50 → 2264.20] Marian topic.
[2264.34 → 2264.56] So.
[2265.10 → 2266.06] Apparently we all.
[2266.06 → 2266.70] Perfect timing.
[2267.02 → 2267.42] Oh.
[2268.04 → 2268.28] Hey.
[2268.88 → 2269.24] Hello.
[2269.54 → 2271.48] Now that's an early Christmas present.
[2271.56 → 2273.26] I have lots of things to say.
[2274.00 → 2275.14] I love video games.
[2275.88 → 2277.86] But this isn't even for me.
[2277.96 → 2278.68] Last time I did this.
[2278.74 → 2279.90] Am I stepping on a mic?
[2280.02 → 2280.24] Riley.
[2280.32 → 2280.82] You're not on a.
[2280.90 → 2281.88] You don't have a mic yet.
[2282.20 → 2282.64] Hold on.
[2282.66 → 2283.76] There's supposed to be one here.
[2283.80 → 2284.22] I don't know.
[2284.32 → 2285.20] Dan promised.
[2285.98 → 2286.24] I know.
[2286.34 → 2287.72] But you don't have it yet.
[2287.76 → 2288.48] You can't talk yet.
[2288.84 → 2289.52] I have to wear the.
[2289.98 → 2290.24] They can hear me.
[2290.24 → 2290.36] Wait.
[2290.36 → 2291.52] Do we have a place for him to sit?
[2291.96 → 2292.42] What do you mean?
[2293.46 → 2294.36] He's just squatting.
[2294.36 → 2294.56] No.
[2294.56 → 2294.70] Wait.
[2294.78 → 2295.42] There's a thing there.
[2295.42 → 2296.42] The world is my oyster.
[2297.22 → 2297.62] Well.
[2297.80 → 2299.22] I can't hear myself through the mic.
[2299.54 → 2299.56] But.
[2299.74 → 2299.98] Why?
[2300.04 → 2300.52] Oh my god.
[2300.78 → 2301.12] I don't.
[2301.24 → 2302.22] I don't know if it's working.
[2302.40 → 2303.86] Guess why I'm here though Linus.
[2304.46 → 2305.94] I can literally see it.
[2306.26 → 2307.22] I can see him talking.
[2307.30 → 2307.88] Why can't we hear it?
[2307.90 → 2308.46] They can hear him.
[2308.50 → 2308.96] They can hear him.
[2308.96 → 2309.42] They can hear him.
[2309.42 → 2310.08] If they're good.
[2310.12 → 2310.44] I'm good.
[2310.70 → 2312.28] You're here to talk about the Marian thing.
[2312.36 → 2312.82] Can they hear.
[2312.94 → 2313.08] Okay.
[2313.16 → 2314.40] Like is it coming from this mic?
[2314.54 → 2315.22] Or is it coming from something?
[2315.28 → 2315.44] Yeah.
[2315.60 → 2315.68] Yeah.
[2315.68 → 2315.76] Yeah.
[2315.76 → 2316.04] Guys.
[2316.22 → 2316.48] I got it.
[2316.50 → 2317.06] Oh there it is.
[2317.22 → 2317.58] Hey.
[2317.58 → 2318.02] Hey.
[2318.98 → 2320.66] I'm here to talk about Luke.
[2321.06 → 2321.46] Yeah.
[2322.14 → 2322.54] Because.
[2323.40 → 2325.22] You haven't let him talk about AI enough.
[2325.32 → 2327.66] Except today you guys talked about AI a ton.
[2327.76 → 2328.54] So like what the heck.
[2329.40 → 2330.26] Well I'll tell you what.
[2330.42 → 2332.18] While you talk about Luke.
[2332.30 → 2333.38] I'm going to go get you a stool.
[2333.54 → 2333.80] What?
[2333.94 → 2334.38] No, no no, no.
[2334.74 → 2337.36] He specifically requested no stool.
[2338.02 → 2339.44] I'm a non stool user.
[2340.26 → 2343.34] I'm like you know how AI boomers are like no AI ever.
[2343.64 → 2344.64] That's me with stools.
[2345.16 → 2346.46] He believes in no stool ever.
[2346.46 → 2351.78] I think stools were trained on other people's work and their copyright infringement.
[2352.02 → 2352.60] How about an apple box?
[2352.60 → 2353.94] It's basically just a chair.
[2354.34 → 2355.82] Stools are just chairs but worse.
[2356.02 → 2356.76] Why would you ever?
[2357.88 → 2358.90] He's going to use an apple box.
[2358.92 → 2359.46] No I asked.
[2360.24 → 2360.48] Okay.
[2361.42 → 2363.44] Now you're going to make me ruin the meme.
[2364.40 → 2366.76] I asked Dan to remove the apple box.
[2369.04 → 2370.30] This is so much worse.
[2371.62 → 2374.76] Oh but I do like if I sit back here then I kind of look like I am.
[2374.76 → 2375.78] You have dramatic lighting.
[2375.78 → 2376.82] I'm lit by two.
[2377.12 → 2377.56] Hold on.
[2378.18 → 2378.82] It's okay.
[2378.90 → 2379.44] I'm lit too.
[2379.80 → 2381.96] I'm lit by both sides, and it's like I am.
[2381.96 → 2382.40] Wow.
[2382.60 → 2383.88] I'm the duality of man.
[2384.04 → 2385.20] A neutral party.
[2385.34 → 2385.64] Okay.
[2389.08 → 2390.22] So should I.
[2390.64 → 2391.92] Not AI generated laugh.
[2392.06 → 2395.56] Should I talk through this and then you guys can have your conversation or.
[2395.56 → 2396.48] How do we.
[2396.54 → 2397.08] How does this work.
[2397.16 → 2397.64] You can go.
[2397.84 → 2397.96] Sure.
[2398.08 → 2398.32] Sure.
[2398.56 → 2398.94] All right.
[2399.16 → 2403.04] Certain corners of the internet lost their flipping minds earlier this week.
[2403.62 → 2406.84] When Larian Studios CEO Win Link told Bloomberg.
[2407.12 → 2407.18] Vicky.
[2407.54 → 2408.24] Yeah of course.
[2408.34 → 2408.94] That's what I was going to say.
[2408.94 → 2409.14] Vicky.
[2409.14 → 2409.24] Vicky.
[2409.66 → 2415.50] Told Bloomberg that the Baldur's Gate 3 studio uses AI tools to help explore ideas and speed
[2415.50 → 2417.52] things along early in the development process.
[2418.60 → 2423.32] I hate how much of my life is reading text and then trying to say it out loud.
[2423.74 → 2425.24] And then having an AI train on it.
[2425.24 → 2425.90] It's Vicky right.
[2426.54 → 2427.24] I have no idea.
[2427.88 → 2428.24] Thanks.
[2428.72 → 2431.56] In the same interview Vicky made it clear.
[2431.72 → 2432.18] I like it.
[2432.22 → 2433.14] It sounds more like a pet name.
[2433.18 → 2434.52] It's got to be Sven Vicky.
[2434.76 → 2435.84] It can't be Sven Link.
[2436.42 → 2437.02] I don't know.
[2437.56 → 2438.54] I don't speak Swedish.
[2438.82 → 2440.44] I don't know if I've heard it said out loud.
[2440.76 → 2443.52] Link sounds like a woodland creature.
[2444.34 → 2446.76] Google it, and then you'll get one of the pronunciation things.
[2446.76 → 2450.64] Vicky sounds like also a woodland creature just way cuter and fluffier.
[2450.86 → 2451.16] Vicky.
[2451.40 → 2451.60] Yeah.
[2451.72 → 2453.24] Maybe from like a fantasy world.
[2453.36 → 2453.50] Okay.
[2453.54 → 2454.10] It doesn't matter.
[2454.20 → 2457.30] The point is that Vicky made it clear.
[2457.30 → 2458.14] Cool guy, baby.
[2458.16 → 2463.00] That there will not be any AI generated content in Marian's upcoming instalment in the Divinity
[2463.00 → 2465.68] series saying that everything is human actors.
[2465.86 → 2468.04] We're writing everything ourselves.
[2468.88 → 2472.76] Jordan, who prepped this topic for us said, but that was toward the end of the article.
[2472.94 → 2475.80] So the odds that anyone read that far, pretty low.
[2475.90 → 2476.66] Nobody has time for that.
[2477.30 → 2483.88] After the inevitable backlash for saying anything even vaguely positive about AI, Vicky took to
[2483.88 → 2485.46] Twitter to try to clarify.
[2486.02 → 2487.00] This is a quote.
[2487.30 → 2489.14] Holy fuck guys.
[2489.14 → 2494.46] We are not pushing hard for or replacing concept artists with AI.
[2495.90 → 2502.86] The post notes that Marian employs 72 artists, 23 of whom are concept artists and that they're
[2502.86 → 2504.74] in the process of hiring more.
[2505.00 → 2505.08] Yeah.
[2505.12 → 2507.86] The concept art is really where it, what this centres around.
[2507.86 → 2513.64] Vicky also linked a Game Spot article from April of this year detailing Marian's use of machine
[2513.64 → 2517.48] learning for tasks that he said, and this is a quote, nobody wants to do.
[2517.48 → 2523.32] This uproar has apparently reminded people that Game of the Year winner, Claire Obscure Expedition
[2523.32 → 2528.74] 33 was accidentally released with AI placeholder art, which was quickly patched out of the game
[2528.74 → 2534.84] back in April, adding a target for the rage of the anti-AI camp.
[2534.84 → 2535.68] Daniel...
[2535.68 → 2536.18] Daniel...
[2536.18 → 2536.68] Daniel...
[2536.68 → 2537.68] Daniel...
[2537.68 → 2539.14] Vary, Vary, whatever.
[2539.38 → 2540.02] Vulva, I think.
[2540.34 → 2540.62] The...
[2540.62 → 2542.14] Did you just say vulva?
[2544.24 → 2544.86] It's what?
[2544.92 → 2545.84] That's not a...
[2545.84 → 2546.68] It's a...
[2546.68 → 2550.32] It's a biological term.
[2550.36 → 2553.64] Important landmark if you're trying to find certain things.
[2557.26 → 2559.62] We're not going to get demonetized for that.
[2559.78 → 2567.00] The point is, the co-founder of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer Warhorse also waded
[2567.00 → 2572.80] into the mess to defend Marian's honour, saying, this AI hysteria is the same as when people
[2572.80 → 2575.34] were smashing steam engines in the 19th century.
[2575.34 → 2581.26] Vicky said Marian was doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing, and they
[2581.26 → 2583.68] got into this insanely crazy shitstorm.
[2583.96 → 2585.24] Everyone else was doing it.
[2585.52 → 2586.34] Vulva adds...
[2586.34 → 2587.50] Hold on, I'm not quite done.
[2588.24 → 2593.74] Vulva adds, I'm no fan of AI-generated art, but anyway, it's time to face reality.
[2594.30 → 2599.80] AI is here to stay with us, as frightening as it may be, that's the way it is.
[2600.20 → 2604.60] Now, I'm going to kick you guys off by throwing back to something that Luke and I were actually
[2604.60 → 2606.70] talking about earlier in this show.
[2608.32 → 2612.20] Marian sits at the apex of the curve.
[2613.24 → 2620.28] They're big enough that they're an attractive target for the hate, but not so big that they'll
[2620.28 → 2623.98] just be like, what are you going to do about it?
[2623.98 → 2624.26] Yeah, yeah.
[2624.76 → 2625.34] All right.
[2625.84 → 2626.28] Go.
[2626.28 → 2630.54] Yeah, one thing I was going to throw in just right off the bat is another game that won
[2630.54 → 2634.50] awards, because right now we're talking about Marian, who took a ton of Game of the Year
[2634.50 → 2639.48] awards and many other rewards, and then we're talking about Expedition 33, which won everything
[2639.48 → 2640.42] as far as I can tell.
[2640.54 → 2643.88] Another game that won awards, the Multiplayer Award of the Year.
[2644.80 → 2647.38] Ark Raiders also has a ton of AI stuff going on.
[2647.38 → 2651.74] All the movement of the AI enemies in the game is all machine learning.
[2652.74 → 2653.18] Really?
[2653.40 → 2653.88] Yeah.
[2654.56 → 2656.26] And you can hear more about that.
[2656.44 → 2656.80] Oh!
[2657.46 → 2657.56] Actually...
[2657.56 → 2658.52] We forgot to...
[2658.52 → 2659.26] Did we even say that?
[2659.38 → 2661.38] That part's not in the video, but...
[2662.10 → 2664.90] We can learn about something.
[2665.32 → 2665.98] But you can...
[2665.98 → 2666.14] Luke Week.
[2666.24 → 2667.10] Luke Week on Flow play.
[2667.10 → 2667.88] You can learn about something.
[2668.16 → 2668.86] Yeah, yeah.
[2669.06 → 2669.80] We're supposed to say that?
[2669.82 → 2670.66] There's Luke Week on Flow play.
[2670.72 → 2670.88] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2670.88 → 2671.46] There are three episodes.
[2671.58 → 2672.24] One's a Q&A.
[2672.32 → 2673.48] One's a gaming video.
[2673.48 → 2678.26] Which is like a follow-up to the last gaming video I did on the first Luke Week.
[2678.40 → 2682.40] And then the other video is something.
[2683.42 → 2685.20] It's us talking about AI.
[2685.20 → 2685.58] Oh, yeah, of course.
[2685.82 → 2686.80] Which is why I'm here.
[2687.02 → 2688.36] And I felt bad that I didn't...
[2688.36 → 2690.32] I was like, we're here for Luke, but then I didn't...
[2690.32 → 2691.58] We didn't even do the call-out.
[2691.66 → 2693.42] Just wanted to get that clear.
[2694.04 → 2695.24] It's Luke Week on Flow play.
[2695.50 → 2695.82] Yeah.
[2696.00 → 2697.56] But anyway, machine learning.
[2697.78 → 2698.38] Ark Raiders.
[2698.62 → 2698.92] Yes.
[2698.92 → 2700.92] So it's kind of...
[2700.92 → 2702.52] It's in a lot of places.
[2703.48 → 2708.68] And if you want to be mad at something for AI stuff, as far as I can tell, the biggest
[2708.68 → 2711.22] use of it is largely in Ark Raiders.
[2713.00 → 2713.48] Interesting.
[2713.66 → 2714.26] That's what...
[2714.26 → 2714.78] See...
[2714.78 → 2715.00] Hmm.
[2715.26 → 2716.62] They have a lot going on.
[2716.72 → 2717.24] Machine learning.
[2717.34 → 2717.58] But I feel like...
[2717.58 → 2720.52] They also defend their stances because of things like that.
[2720.62 → 2724.08] But one of the problems is that everyone's throwing everything under the same banner.
[2724.30 → 2728.12] And then it's kind of difficult because where's the line?
[2728.12 → 2729.42] Well, this is an interesting...
[2729.42 → 2732.18] Because with Sven Wienie, he...
[2732.18 → 2736.58] On his tweet where he's like, guys, seriously, like, you know, we're the good guys.
[2736.74 → 2742.18] He links to a Game Spot article where he talks about how they use machine learning for like
[2742.18 → 2745.08] the kind of rote menial tasks that no one wants to do.
[2745.08 → 2752.90] But the debate isn't really around like, oh, okay, you used AI to like smooth out your
[2752.90 → 2754.32] mesh or whatever.
[2754.40 → 2754.78] I don't know.
[2754.78 → 2755.44] I'm not a developer.
[2755.60 → 2755.96] I don't understand.
[2756.12 → 2759.58] But like stuff that isn't like, ooh, the artistry involved in that.
[2759.64 → 2762.70] It's just kind of like, okay, you have to reduce the amount of polygons or whatever.
[2762.70 → 2763.22] And it's annoying.
[2763.22 → 2767.80] In a way, his argument is that it's actually accomplishing what a lot of people wanted out
[2767.80 → 2771.68] of it, which is that it's allowing for people to focus more on the artistic stuff that they
[2771.68 → 2776.26] want to do instead of the like menial, annoying tasks that they don't want to do, which is
[2776.26 → 2777.52] like...
[2777.52 → 2782.22] But that's why the backlash isn't about the machine learning, the more traditional...
[2782.82 → 2783.42] It's about generative AI.
[2783.42 → 2785.24] What we called AI back then, sort of.
[2785.60 → 2786.92] It's about the concept art.
[2787.06 → 2789.52] The problem with arc raiders is people don't know where the line is.
[2790.22 → 2793.18] There are a lot of questions for like, that thing looks like it might.
[2793.22 → 2798.54] be AI generated, be like generative AI generated because there's little like, what do you
[2798.54 → 2798.76] call it?
[2798.84 → 2799.16] Greeley?
[2799.98 → 2803.14] What's the term for when there's just like random stuff added to things to make it look...
[2803.14 → 2804.06] I call them rubles.
[2804.22 → 2804.50] Troubles.
[2805.14 → 2805.84] This is...
[2805.84 → 2807.40] Star Wars is really well known for this.
[2807.50 → 2807.56] Oh, like...
[2807.56 → 2808.08] Oh, like...
[2808.08 → 2808.68] They just like...
[2808.68 → 2810.78] They'll put like vents and pipes on things and whatever.
[2810.78 → 2814.20] Yeah, I know what it's called in the context of a garment, like an embellishment, but that's
[2814.20 → 2814.82] not what they're called.
[2815.00 → 2815.06] Sure.
[2815.08 → 2816.02] I think it's Baby Frick.
[2816.26 → 2816.72] There's a...
[2816.72 → 2817.14] There's a word.
[2817.14 → 2818.40] So there's a lot of Baby Frick's.
[2818.40 → 2818.88] Freebies.
[2819.88 → 2820.36] Freebies?
[2820.44 → 2820.88] Yeah, I don't know.
[2820.90 → 2821.24] Is that right?
[2821.24 → 2821.78] Oh, okay.
[2822.18 → 2823.42] Yeah, it's like a term.
[2823.56 → 2824.20] I don't remember what it is.
[2824.70 → 2825.46] Baby Frick's, though.
[2825.50 → 2825.90] I'm down with that.
[2825.96 → 2832.06] So there are tons of Baby Frick's in Ark Raiders where there's just like a tube that'll go from
[2832.06 → 2834.38] one place to another place that makes no sense at all.
[2834.56 → 2838.26] And people are wondering like, was this someone just adding a tube because it looks cool?
[2838.40 → 2840.02] Which totally might be a thing.
[2840.14 → 2841.10] Sometimes you like tubes.
[2842.04 → 2844.70] Or is this just generative AI just doing stuff?
[2845.12 → 2846.24] And it's...
[2846.24 → 2847.40] Where is the line?
[2847.50 → 2848.02] What's going on?
[2848.02 → 2856.90] The most interesting aspect of the debate here for me was basically whether we are going
[2856.90 → 2860.30] to preserve the practice of like concept art.
[2860.42 → 2862.82] I think people are scared that if you...
[2862.82 → 2866.98] Because the most concerning part was him saying, oh, for the early concepting phase.
[2867.04 → 2870.84] Only in the early phase, we kind of are throwing ideas at the wall and seeing what sticks.
[2870.84 → 2875.34] So like, we're like, hmm, would it be funny to have a frog wearing a top hat or something?
[2875.42 → 2879.08] And then you like to find an image of a frog or whatever, and you tell him, I put a top
[2879.08 → 2879.66] hat on him.
[2879.72 → 2880.70] And then they do it.
[2880.74 → 2882.64] And they're like, hmm, it's not so funny.
[2882.70 → 2883.92] Maybe we won't go with that, you know?
[2884.04 → 2884.58] It is funky.
[2884.94 → 2890.40] And the alternative to that would have been, hey, a concept artist, can you draw a frog
[2890.40 → 2891.14] wearing a top hat?
[2891.14 → 2896.74] Now, I feel like in that situation, I can easily see a concept artist kind of taking
[2896.74 → 2902.38] that idea and making a top hat on a frog look funny and look interesting in a way that AI
[2902.38 → 2903.40] wouldn't be able to.
[2903.58 → 2912.08] But couldn't a concept artist also put that prompt in and go, yeah, it's funny, but I think
[2912.08 → 2913.64] I could do it better and draw something?
[2913.64 → 2921.84] Well, the counterpoint to that is that you're basically like starting from, if you prompt
[2921.84 → 2925.60] AI and you get a result back, and you're like, hmm, okay, I'm going to do that, but better
[2925.60 → 2927.08] or I'm going to like iterate on that.
[2927.68 → 2928.28] You're okay.
[2928.28 → 2933.66] You're starting with the thought process and that's part of the human, you know, creativity
[2933.66 → 2934.78] engine.
[2935.02 → 2937.52] But this is a studied phenomenon.
[2937.82 → 2943.30] People are more creative, and they think better through problems if they do it themselves
[2943.30 → 2945.90] from scratch or if they learn how to do it themselves from scratch.
[2946.10 → 2948.04] And like, this might be a solution.
[2948.22 → 2949.44] This is the whole problem with AI.
[2949.66 → 2956.38] It's a solution to do something faster, but you're probably going to get a worse output
[2956.38 → 2957.16] at the end of it.
[2957.16 → 2964.72] And maybe even if, so if you have a super experienced concept artist today, they could use, potentially,
[2965.02 → 2969.40] they could use AI to accelerate a quality job.
[2969.40 → 2975.84] But if you are losing out on the development of your ability to think through these problems
[2975.84 → 2977.80] because you've always had this crutch.
[2978.80 → 2983.10] But then, I mean, oh man, see now we're going back to the calculator argument.
[2983.34 → 2987.42] You won't have a calculator in your pocket, so you need to be able to start things from
[2987.42 → 2987.80] scratch.
[2987.80 → 2994.34] But yes, if a calculator had the result of like the cumulative output of human knowledge
[2994.34 → 2999.66] being reduced, like in mathematics, if our ability to do advanced mathematics at the highest
[2999.66 → 3003.36] levels was reduced because of calculators, maybe it has been.
[3003.48 → 3004.60] I think there's also a problem here.
[3004.60 → 3004.68] How can we tell?
[3004.68 → 3010.44] Where you have the like, the movie adaptation to a book problem, where like once you've
[3010.44 → 3014.68] seen the movie adaptation to the book, when you read the book, your brain is kind of filling
[3014.68 → 3017.72] in like, oh, this is what this person looks like.
[3017.78 → 3019.56] This is what this place looks like, whatever.
[3019.82 → 3022.60] Where if you're just reading the book, I've never seen any of those references.
[3022.84 → 3023.98] You kind of make it up yourself.
[3024.22 → 3026.18] I mean, if I've seen a frog with a top hat.
[3026.42 → 3029.14] There are definitely people who are not susceptible to that.
[3029.14 → 3035.96] I mean, I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to read The Hobbit and then create
[3035.96 → 3037.08] such a shit movie.
[3038.20 → 3040.56] They clearly completely reimagined that.
[3040.68 → 3041.34] Not for the better.
[3041.72 → 3041.90] Yeah.
[3042.08 → 3045.38] I think there's a whole nother set of incentives and problems there.
[3045.74 → 3046.24] Have you seen it?
[3046.24 → 3048.54] They recast Aragorn in the new Gollum movie.
[3049.56 → 3050.48] You guys haven't heard about this?
[3050.48 → 3051.34] Because he's younger.
[3051.94 → 3053.20] Yeah, but Gandalf's in it.
[3053.42 → 3055.00] Like Ian McKellen has Gandalf in it.
[3055.00 → 3055.68] Wait, what?
[3055.68 → 3057.24] But Vigo's too old.
[3057.90 → 3058.28] Anyway.
[3058.28 → 3060.62] They should have just done it anyway.
[3060.74 → 3061.62] They should have just used Vigo.
[3061.82 → 3062.26] I mean...
[3062.26 → 3065.44] I'm pretty annoyed about that, but I mean, that is what it is.
[3065.98 → 3068.72] I mean, the movie's going to suck anyway, so does it really matter?
[3069.54 → 3069.90] Hmm.
[3070.18 → 3071.48] Did you watch The War of the Cherrim?
[3071.74 → 3072.18] I...
[3072.18 → 3072.48] Yeah.
[3072.80 → 3073.88] It's so bad.
[3073.94 → 3074.80] I couldn't make it through it.
[3074.80 → 3075.54] I really wanted to.
[3075.54 → 3078.58] It's funny, because it's like, oh, Peter Jackson's returning for the Hunt for the Gollum movie,
[3078.68 → 3081.94] so it's like, but that doesn't mean anything, because he did The Hobbit movies, and they're horrible.
[3082.06 → 3083.50] Didn't he come in...
[3083.50 → 3084.28] But wait, it's not...
[3087.28 → 3087.72] Okay.
[3087.72 → 3088.72] Ah, nice.
[3088.72 → 3090.38] Didn't he come in late on The Hobbit movies?
[3090.72 → 3091.06] Did he?
[3091.06 → 3092.84] I thought he came in to, like, try to save them.
[3092.94 → 3094.06] I have to admit that I don't...
[3094.74 → 3098.68] I know hardly anything about The Hobbit movies, because I went to see the first one in theatre,
[3098.82 → 3100.06] and I was like, this is horrendous.
[3100.10 → 3104.02] I saw it also in 48 FPS, and I was like, this is horrendous, and I just didn't watch The
[3104.02 → 3104.16] Next Two.
[3104.16 → 3104.84] I did the same thing.
[3104.86 → 3105.56] You did the right thing.
[3105.56 → 3110.90] I watched The Next Two, because I'm a completions and masochist like that, I guess, but...
[3110.90 → 3111.66] I don't think I saw them.
[3111.66 → 3112.30] They didn't get better.
[3112.44 → 3113.58] Maybe I did, but I don't think I did.
[3113.60 → 3114.16] They didn't get better.
[3114.32 → 3114.54] Yeah.
[3114.80 → 3119.26] I would watch the heck out of, like, a fan cut, which probably exists.
[3119.26 → 3120.02] I think there is one.
[3120.02 → 3120.56] That's just one movie.
[3120.80 → 3123.32] Because I complained about this on Sancho a while ago, and someone mentioned that I
[3123.32 → 3124.06] think there is one.
[3124.38 → 3124.40] Yeah.
[3124.52 → 3124.70] Okay.
[3124.70 → 3126.24] I don't want to take us too far off the rails.
[3126.46 → 3128.56] Back to AI stuff in video games.
[3128.64 → 3128.80] Yeah.
[3128.86 → 3136.76] I mean, like, it's also a tough line, because we're at a spot, and I think this has been
[3136.76 → 3140.80] addressed, actually, by potentially Larry, and I'm not sure, but we're at a weird spot
[3140.80 → 3147.60] where, like, a lot of people are demanding stances of different tools and technologies that
[3147.60 → 3150.92] people, companies, really, will not use.
[3151.04 → 3155.58] And they're looking for people to make permanent statements on those things, and none of us
[3155.58 → 3158.30] have any idea what's going to happen to the landscape moving forward.
[3158.30 → 3164.38] And that could put companies that are actually going to bother potentially responding to any
[3164.38 → 3169.86] of this and having open dialogues with people, like Larry, at potentially extremely disadvantageous
[3169.86 → 3175.80] positions in a field that is incredibly mind-blowing cutthroat and competitive.
[3175.80 → 3181.08] And you have companies that are not laying people off, that are actively hiring, that
[3181.08 → 3184.82] are making games that people like, and those companies are the ones that are getting critically
[3184.82 → 3189.48] looked at when there are companies that are laying people off and are, in some cases, known
[3189.48 → 3191.26] for using even more AI stuff.
[3191.46 → 3193.82] And those companies are being ignored in this case.
[3193.94 → 3197.34] And it's just like, ah, I think we need better targets for this energy.
[3197.48 → 3200.64] I saw a perfect tweet, because I can't be here very long.
[3200.64 → 3206.40] I saw a perfect tweet where someone's like, gamers are, like, they don't want games
[3206.40 → 3206.96] to be delayed.
[3207.42 → 3212.34] They don't want studios to force the developers to crunch, either.
[3212.76 → 3214.26] They don't want people to use AI.
[3215.14 → 3217.84] But they also want the games to come out and play them.
[3218.00 → 3220.02] It's like, they can't have all of these.
[3220.44 → 3221.40] They want everything.
[3221.56 → 3223.30] Gamers are a difficult bunch.
[3223.56 → 3223.76] Yeah.
[3223.76 → 3223.84] Yeah.
[3224.34 → 3230.90] I take the opinion that, like, look, if you want to use AI for small parts that isn't,
[3231.14 → 3234.22] like, and, like, according to your principle that you talk about.
[3234.42 → 3234.72] No output.
[3234.92 → 3235.34] No output.
[3235.42 → 3237.58] Don't use the unaltered output, you know.
[3238.30 → 3238.70] Never.
[3239.26 → 3240.52] Which is what Marian's saying.
[3240.70 → 3244.84] If they want to do that as part of the pipeline, you know, go for it.
[3244.84 → 3249.54] I don't think we should jump down their throats for that, given how AI is here already.
[3249.54 → 3256.20] However, I will have way more respect for a company if they do everything without AI
[3256.20 → 3258.36] and take a freaking long time.
[3258.44 → 3259.76] It's just like, is that possible?
[3260.40 → 3261.56] Do the economics work?
[3261.78 → 3261.98] Sorry.
[3262.14 → 3262.72] What would you...
[3262.72 → 3265.26] I was just going to say that AI is...
[3265.26 → 3273.36] I don't know if anybody noticed this, but AI, for a person who runs a company that has
[3273.36 → 3279.52] been to a fault transparent and taken stances on a lot of things, AI is one of the ones that
[3279.54 → 3286.26] if you've been listening very carefully, I have never made any kind of commitments for
[3286.26 → 3287.34] for Linus Media Group.
[3288.34 → 3289.80] For or against, I think.
[3290.26 → 3290.44] Nope.
[3290.44 → 3292.24] We, like, barely use it internally.
[3292.26 → 3296.34] Even when Microsoft came in here and offered to replace all the employees for free.
[3296.34 → 3297.22] Every single one of them.
[3297.22 → 3297.40] Yeah.
[3297.62 → 3298.16] You were like, you know what?
[3298.16 → 3298.86] That didn't happen.
[3298.98 → 3299.54] Not today, Satya.
[3299.54 → 3300.04] Even Linus.
[3300.04 → 3304.56] I'm trying to have a serious conversation and you guys are completely taking it off the
[3304.56 → 3308.00] rails, which is fine because I wasn't going to give an answer anyway.
[3308.00 → 3314.10] Honestly, this conversation was way more on the rails than it should have been for me
[3314.10 → 3314.72] coming in here.
[3314.72 → 3319.06] And I don't think I even have time to be part of the Mozilla one because I feel like I wanted
[3319.06 → 3322.50] to combine those two with the Marian and the Mozilla because they're both just being
[3322.50 → 3322.82] attacked.
[3322.92 → 3325.42] We can talk Mozilla, but first, I want to do something fun.
[3326.48 → 3327.42] So, I had...
[3327.42 → 3328.48] You say he doesn't have time.
[3328.94 → 3331.10] Well, no, you guys can talk about Mozilla.
[3331.26 → 3335.00] So, there was a little comment here in Float plane from Veloce that I had highlighted I wanted
[3335.00 → 3335.58] to talk about.
[3335.70 → 3338.80] Yeah, the biggest problem here is that for a vocal minority, it's binary.
[3338.80 → 3344.60] There's no nuance to this conversation and that's one of the reasons that I haven't taken
[3344.60 → 3350.62] a stance because people are going to expect me to take like a hardline stance when even
[3350.62 → 3354.94] if I did, it wouldn't be something that I could fully control anyway.
[3355.16 → 3358.20] I don't know if I even want to say this, but hot take.
[3359.88 → 3360.30] I'm AI.
[3360.30 → 3361.82] There are companies like...
[3361.82 → 3363.82] I am AI.
[3364.56 → 3365.72] There are companies like...
[3365.72 → 3368.68] I don't remember the name of the company behind it, but they made Silk Song.
[3369.42 → 3370.62] They're like three people.
[3371.02 → 3371.50] Team Cherry.
[3371.68 → 3372.84] Team Cherry has like three people.
[3372.94 → 3374.08] Maybe they can control for this.
[3374.46 → 3380.58] At bigger companies, like Marian has hundreds, and they're not even seen as like a big studio.
[3382.78 → 3388.20] All of those games, if it's a binary that you're looking at this set, will be made with
[3388.20 → 3388.46] AI.
[3388.46 → 3392.52] I think I can pretty confidently say that statement and I don't...
[3392.52 → 3395.74] Even if the head of the company is like, don't use it.
[3395.96 → 3397.10] It's still going to happen.
[3397.24 → 3398.04] Do you remember...
[3398.04 → 3399.28] Because employees are going to try to take shortcuts.
[3399.42 → 3402.02] Do you remember when we had a minor controversy?
[3403.54 → 3405.46] When one of our...
[3405.46 → 3409.46] I had taken...
[3409.46 → 3410.24] Remember that one time?
[3410.24 → 3418.96] No, sorry.
[3419.16 → 3419.72] I don't.
[3420.16 → 3421.44] I have no memory.
[3421.44 → 3423.52] You legitimately might not remember this one.
[3423.58 → 3423.68] Okay.
[3423.84 → 3424.60] It's not ringing a bell.
[3424.60 → 3433.18] So we had a minor controversy a while back where I had on WAN show said that I didn't feel
[3433.18 → 3437.14] that in our industry working the way that we do and relying on ads the way that we do,
[3437.46 → 3438.98] that we should use AdBlock.
[3439.18 → 3443.28] And I had made it a policy at our company that we don't install it on our computers.
[3443.28 → 3450.34] And I got called out like a couple of weeks later or something for using AdBlock because I screen
[3450.34 → 3454.86] shared on something, and I was using a laptop that someone else had set up, someone else
[3454.86 → 3455.48] had configured.
[3456.10 → 3459.00] That is a perfect example of what you just said.
[3459.00 → 3466.38] How in a company of more than one person or even in a company of one person, someone can forget
[3466.38 → 3469.80] a thing that they said at some point and do something.
[3469.90 → 3473.78] But especially in a company of more than one person, you can have a stance on something.
[3473.92 → 3474.72] You can have an opinion.
[3474.88 → 3476.30] You can even have a policy.
[3476.72 → 3479.60] But at the end of the day, not everyone is going to follow it.
[3479.64 → 3484.50] So you could say, no AI will make it into anything that we do.
[3484.94 → 3485.72] All you want.
[3485.72 → 3492.30] I had to read a sponsor spot that was clearly AI generated not that long ago because it
[3492.30 → 3498.40] was in the form of like rhyming couplets with all the sponsor talking points.
[3498.46 → 3499.60] And I'm like, okay, two things.
[3499.72 → 3504.20] One, if you used AI for this, bad.
[3504.56 → 3510.90] And two, if you did this without AI, double bad because what a waste of time.
[3511.56 → 3514.00] It was like passable, but not good.
[3514.00 → 3516.08] Yeah, it was AI.
[3516.50 → 3517.72] Okay, there's one other thing.
[3517.94 → 3523.46] Some concept artist is going to have a bad week and be really frustrated and have a deadline
[3523.46 → 3524.88] for frog with top hat.
[3525.26 → 3529.48] And be like, oh my God, I just, I can't get the pose right for some reason.
[3529.82 → 3531.18] But generate, okay, cool.
[3531.26 → 3532.56] Yeah, I can make that work.
[3532.64 → 3537.02] Whatever the artist equivalent of writer's block is, they're going to use a tool.
[3538.12 → 3538.94] Brush block.
[3538.94 → 3539.26] Sure.
[3539.76 → 3542.86] Okay, the other thing I wanted was you guys were talking about Greeley or whatever.
[3543.36 → 3549.52] And I was like, oh, I wonder what an AI response to the right number of pieces of flare is.
[3549.74 → 3553.84] Like, will it get the office reference, or will it come up with something?
[3554.18 → 3556.90] So I typed how many pieces of flare is the right amount.
[3556.90 → 3560.96] And it literally is like, new, try AI mode.
[3561.08 → 3562.42] In your face, in your face.
[3562.50 → 3563.38] AI powered responses.
[3563.72 → 3566.12] You literally gave me the AI response.
[3566.90 → 3567.30] Well.
[3567.58 → 3569.02] Whether I consented to it or not.
[3569.46 → 3570.50] Okay, well I can.
[3570.80 → 3572.24] If you click not interested, what happens?
[3572.44 → 3572.88] The way Google.
[3572.88 → 3573.96] No, no, it's a different thing.
[3574.06 → 3575.72] But still, like what the heck.
[3575.82 → 3579.68] The way they're branding all this stuff is so insane, annoying to me.
[3579.96 → 3582.00] Especially as like covering tech news.
[3582.48 → 3586.28] And like, it's like Google updated this and they have a new mode.
[3586.40 → 3590.12] And I'm just like, and I have to read through and be like, okay, so this is like the other,
[3590.20 → 3593.26] this is like the four other things that they call like, because they have Gemini.
[3593.54 → 3596.22] They have Google regular search.
[3596.32 → 3598.24] They have Google AI overviews.
[3598.24 → 3603.30] They have AI mode, which is basically just using Gemini, but like it's more, more search.
[3603.42 → 3603.92] It's like.
[3604.56 → 3605.06] All right.
[3605.08 → 3606.58] So let's find out what this does.
[3607.24 → 3607.64] Sure.
[3608.52 → 3609.12] It's like, yeah.
[3609.12 → 3609.86] Oh, okay.
[3609.86 → 3610.08] Okay.
[3610.08 → 3612.82] So now it just comes up in a different interface.
[3613.04 → 3617.74] It's basically Gemini, except it's like, what we're doing here is searching the web for
[3617.74 → 3618.08] stuff.
[3618.24 → 3618.42] Yeah.
[3618.52 → 3618.72] Yeah.
[3619.28 → 3621.30] So it's just Gemini, but focused on search.
[3621.38 → 3621.56] Yeah.
[3621.76 → 3622.20] What?
[3622.68 → 3625.24] This is such a stupid, it was doing really well.
[3625.70 → 3630.08] The running joke, blah, blah, 15 pieces of Flair, blah, blah, et cetera, office space.
[3630.64 → 3633.32] Outside the film, there's no set right amount to Flair.
[3633.32 → 3638.06] The term has come to refer to other things, including Flair Airlines baggage allowances.
[3638.06 → 3638.50] No.
[3640.32 → 3640.76] No.
[3641.32 → 3641.56] Hey.
[3641.62 → 3642.34] No, it hasn't.
[3642.36 → 3644.10] Hey, haven't you ever taken a shot?
[3644.22 → 3647.46] You know, just like it took a swing and it missed that time.
[3647.86 → 3648.68] Yes, it did.
[3648.78 → 3649.74] It's got chutzpah.
[3649.74 → 3652.36] Good Lord.
[3652.42 → 3654.32] I wanted to say, well, I already said it.
[3654.62 → 3654.94] Okay.
[3655.82 → 3658.78] Well, you wanted to talk about the Mozilla thing, right?
[3658.86 → 3659.26] Do you have time?
[3660.22 → 3660.62] Okay.
[3660.62 → 3662.74] I really need to go.
[3662.88 → 3670.62] But basically, my main, I wrote this, I wrote the tech link story, somebody.
[3671.58 → 3673.24] A probationary employee.
[3674.26 → 3675.98] Wrote notes.
[3676.80 → 3677.68] They're almost done.
[3677.68 → 3681.02] I wrote notes for it and then I kind of edited the notes again.
[3681.08 → 3686.58] But basically, the gist is that Mozilla got attacked because they have a new CEO.
[3686.84 → 3691.92] Firefox is going to evolve into a modern AI browser is what he said.
[3691.96 → 3695.68] But he also really emphasized trust and user agency and stuff.
[3695.70 → 3699.02] And people will like jump down their throats for adding AI.
[3699.02 → 3704.00] There were so many articles and tweets and stuff where it was like, Firefox is adding AI now?
[3704.04 → 3704.34] No!
[3704.64 → 3705.16] I'm out.
[3705.82 → 3710.12] Guys, Firefox has had AI features for a long time.
[3710.94 → 3712.24] All the things that I listed there.
[3712.24 → 3714.00] And people have been talking about this for a while.
[3714.00 → 3715.60] Alt text generation for accessibility.
[3716.16 → 3716.72] Translation.
[3717.24 → 3718.42] Automatic tab grouping.
[3718.94 → 3720.20] Link previews with summaries.
[3720.62 → 3721.90] Chatbots in the sidebar.
[3722.40 → 3728.36] An AI window that's currently in beta that you can open like a private slash incognito window.
[3729.02 → 3736.00] Yeah, and I noted that most Firefox users may not have noticed these because they're all optional features, and you can turn them off.
[3736.88 → 3740.04] And this is like something that they're going to continue doing.
[3740.26 → 3744.50] I feel like I'm coming out here and being like, guys, don't be mad at AI.
[3744.92 → 3746.80] Like, you can be mad at AI.
[3746.94 → 3748.00] I don't like AI.
[3748.22 → 3750.80] Just like on a principle.
[3751.14 → 3755.08] But I understand that like what Firefox is saying here as well is that it's out of the bag.
[3755.22 → 3756.04] It's out there.
[3756.04 → 3765.32] And if they don't add some kind of features in a thoughtful way, they're going to be left behind.
[3765.44 → 3766.74] And they are being left behind.
[3767.04 → 3771.18] Yeah, I mean, Vivaldi had that mic drop where they were like, here's our press conference.
[3772.68 → 3773.60] There's no AI.
[3773.84 → 3775.18] And then they like to walk out of frame.
[3775.36 → 3776.84] And it's like, yeah, that's nice.
[3776.96 → 3777.56] But you're like.
[3777.64 → 3779.08] There's barely a Vivaldi.
[3779.22 → 3779.42] Yeah.
[3779.48 → 3781.00] What's Vivaldi's market share?
[3781.06 → 3781.72] You looking it up?
[3782.10 → 3782.82] Ask AI.
[3782.82 → 3784.30] I think it's like 1%.
[3784.30 → 3792.18] But Firefox has gone from 30% around 2010 to like, I think it's 4% or so on desktop.
[3792.52 → 3795.30] And across all platforms, it's like 2%.
[3795.30 → 3796.46] It's crazy.
[3797.02 → 3797.86] Yeah, Vivaldi is like.
[3798.02 → 3799.52] But like, I also want to say.
[3799.52 → 3800.68] That is the AI overview though.
[3800.78 → 3801.36] I don't know.
[3801.48 → 3807.58] Maybe, you know, I feel like there totally could be a future where Vivaldi or whoever is like,
[3807.58 → 3811.18] hey, all these browsers over, like they've been overtaken by AI slop.
[3811.30 → 3813.12] We're the browser that doesn't have any AI.
[3813.54 → 3814.72] We're the human browser.
[3815.20 → 3818.44] And like, you know, people go for that because of that.
[3818.52 → 3820.18] Like that's their marketing angle, you know?
[3820.22 → 3822.38] And then if that becomes popular, cool.
[3822.74 → 3823.58] I just feel like.
[3823.58 → 3826.90] Like, I don't like the jumping.
[3827.12 → 3832.82] I didn't like the thinking that Firefox is adding AI for the first time when like, you
[3832.82 → 3837.08] guys say that you're Firefox users, but you don't even know what the browser is.
[3837.52 → 3840.80] And B, like, you know, this is where we're at now.
[3840.88 → 3841.28] I don't know.
[3841.68 → 3846.40] And I think it's important to understand like all of our various perspectives as we come
[3846.40 → 3846.96] into this.
[3846.96 → 3850.70] Like, you know, I'm both a business owner and a creative.
[3850.98 → 3857.12] Like, I don't use AI for writing, not because necessarily it's out of principle.
[3857.12 → 3860.12] I can recognize how it could be useful for some people.
[3860.50 → 3861.86] I just don't need it.
[3862.06 → 3868.46] And I don't feel that it, I don't feel that it makes, even if it makes something that I'm
[3868.46 → 3874.16] writing better, what it can't do is make it more me, at least not at this time.
[3874.16 → 3878.42] You know if we could train an internal LLM on every script I've ever written or edited,
[3878.84 → 3879.98] maybe it could.
[3880.38 → 3884.00] Maybe it could literally like to perform some manner of like editing for me.
[3884.06 → 3889.36] But a big part of how my brain works is just like being kind of ADD and going in a different
[3889.36 → 3890.24] direction all the time.
[3890.54 → 3896.64] You know, Luke's coming at it from, he manages a team of developers where AI assisted tools
[3896.64 → 3899.50] have been just like a thing.
[3899.62 → 3901.32] Everybody been doing it for a while.
[3901.34 → 3902.32] For a long time.
[3902.32 → 3903.72] This is old.
[3903.72 → 3908.80] You know, Riley's coming at this from a very like creative minded headspace as well.
[3908.86 → 3909.90] So we're all going to have.
[3910.00 → 3910.34] Wow.
[3910.94 → 3911.34] What?
[3911.46 → 3911.72] I think.
[3911.82 → 3912.40] I'm creative.
[3913.00 → 3915.26] I think you're very creative, Riley.
[3915.76 → 3916.20] Go on.
[3916.42 → 3922.36] And anyone who's watched your creative sponsor reads, which are literally called that, CSP,
[3922.48 → 3924.70] creative sponsor placements.
[3924.70 → 3925.60] I was just doing a bit.
[3925.70 → 3926.24] We don't have to.
[3927.42 → 3927.90] But yes.
[3927.90 → 3928.46] I don't know what the P is.
[3928.54 → 3929.72] I was wondering about this a while.
[3929.72 → 3930.78] Creative sponsor production.
[3931.30 → 3931.78] Production.
[3931.78 → 3932.64] All right.
[3932.74 → 3937.76] Anyway, the point is like, this is our perspective, and you don't have to share our perspective.
[3937.76 → 3948.14] But what you're going to have to kind of come to terms with is that everybody is going to have a different perspective that is motivated by their own personal interests and the people around them.
[3948.14 → 3954.36] And what all of those things are going to need to mesh with is that it's here.
[3955.02 → 3955.72] It's happening.
[3956.46 → 3958.50] The steam engine is not coming back.
[3958.96 → 3963.62] You know, the icebox harvesting the ice from a cave or whatever.
[3964.66 → 3965.74] Refrigeration happened.
[3966.08 → 3967.28] And we're not going to do that anymore.
[3967.46 → 3968.70] Technically, people still do that.
[3968.80 → 3969.04] Oh, yeah.
[3969.04 → 3970.38] People still ride horses, too.
[3970.54 → 3970.72] Yeah.
[3970.72 → 3975.22] But it's a thing that people are very passionate about, and they very much do.
[3975.76 → 3976.64] But it's not just like...
[3976.64 → 3982.84] And you're going to get tiny, you know, one, two, three-bit studios that just like the process and want to do it.
[3983.12 → 3984.36] And they do it.
[3984.46 → 3985.04] And that's fine.
[3985.12 → 3985.92] I just want to jump in.
[3986.02 → 3989.78] I don't think Luke meant like two-bit studios like crappy.
[3990.76 → 3992.06] No, I mean amount of people.
[3992.58 → 3993.00] Cool.
[3993.20 → 3993.40] Yeah.
[3993.68 → 3993.88] Yeah.
[3993.88 → 3995.24] So thanks for the clarification.
[3995.80 → 3998.74] Two-bit has kind of like a negative connotation.
[3998.88 → 3999.34] Oh, yeah.
[3999.46 → 4002.20] No, I meant in an actually very positive connotation.
[4002.30 → 4003.98] I'm thinking again of Team Cherry.
[4004.22 → 4004.52] I get it.
[4004.60 → 4004.86] I get it.
[4004.86 → 4005.62] Three people.
[4005.70 → 4005.84] Yep.
[4005.92 → 4006.06] Yep.
[4006.24 → 4007.10] Amazing game.
[4007.18 → 4008.66] I feel like that usually goes the other way.
[4008.78 → 4009.24] That was interesting.
[4009.30 → 4010.38] I'm just saving us here.
[4010.40 → 4010.78] I don't know.
[4010.78 → 4011.50] Yeah, I don't know that one.
[4011.52 → 4012.90] He saved you from something.
[4012.94 → 4013.08] Yeah.
[4013.08 → 4013.34] That's good.
[4013.38 → 4014.96] You were about to be cancelled right away.
[4016.42 → 4017.02] Express lane.
[4017.74 → 4020.88] Probably not as major as the hard R incident, but...
[4021.74 → 4021.94] Yeah.
[4021.94 → 4026.66] I feel compelled to point out before I leave, I'm going to leave now.
[4027.00 → 4033.10] I feel compelled to point out that in my attempt to straddle the line between both the blue
[4033.10 → 4039.84] and the red here, to be the only one who walks in both worlds like Ghost Rider, played
[4039.84 → 4047.04] by Nicolas Cage, I feel like I come off as too pro-AI, and I feel like I am very much
[4047.04 → 4047.44] in the middle.
[4047.44 → 4055.68] The way I see this is like alcohol legalization, or legalization of most...
[4055.68 → 4057.26] Prohibition won't work.
[4057.28 → 4058.32] Yeah, it's not going to work.
[4058.60 → 4062.64] It has to be legal so that it can be...
[4062.64 → 4063.24] Regulated.
[4063.38 → 4063.78] Regulated.
[4063.78 → 4064.86] Yeah, but we aren't regulating it.
[4064.86 → 4070.36] Well, and it won't be, but I just feel like you can't put the cat back in the bag, but we
[4070.36 → 4073.76] also don't have to yell at the cat for being out of the bag, you know?
[4073.76 → 4077.14] Every time it shows its face, we have to be like, okay, the cat is here.
[4077.30 → 4079.18] I don't like cats, but I'm not going to...
[4079.18 → 4079.68] You know the right thing.
[4079.84 → 4084.30] I don't think either of us are particularly like pro-AI usage, to be clear.
[4084.40 → 4085.00] No, I don't think any of us are, no.
[4085.00 → 4086.02] Just in case anyone's interpreting that way.
[4086.20 → 4086.38] Yeah.
[4086.64 → 4088.28] No, I mean, I think I brought up...
[4088.28 → 4089.06] We're all perfect centrists.
[4089.10 → 4094.12] I think I brought up my OpenAI account on stream a little while ago, and I had like three
[4094.12 → 4095.80] or four chat windows with it.
[4096.00 → 4097.04] Like, it's...
[4097.04 → 4101.98] I don't use it, but I also...
[4101.98 → 4103.88] You know, it's in the same way that...
[4103.88 → 4109.92] Okay, we did an AMD Ultimate Tech upgrade where one of the first things that we did was make
[4109.92 → 4114.82] a joke about how Colton's brother-in-law has kind of serial killer vibes, and then we went
[4114.82 → 4120.38] down to his garage to find a shovel so that we could do a take of me talking about...
[4120.38 → 4124.06] Because he works for our customer service, and I was saying, you know, when you contact
[4124.06 → 4126.24] us, he'll make sure you get taken care of.
[4126.50 → 4130.16] And so we went to find a shovel so he could be like patting the earth behind me as I did
[4130.16 → 4130.62] the line.
[4131.12 → 4140.18] And in his garage, we found a tool that had a handle, kind of like a hammer, and then
[4140.18 → 4145.38] on the one side, it had a hatchet blade that was sharp on the end and on the bottom.
[4145.90 → 4148.48] So it's like a two-sided like hatchet blade.
[4148.48 → 4151.54] And then on the other side was a meat tenderizer.
[4152.42 → 4155.80] And so I found that tool...
[4155.80 → 4156.88] It's for like processing game?
[4157.64 → 4158.42] Couldn't tell you.
[4158.58 → 4158.82] Okay.
[4159.28 → 4161.24] And what I realized was...
[4161.24 → 4161.74] It's for murder.
[4161.88 → 4167.08] That's a fascinating tool that could maybe be useful to someone.
[4167.46 → 4170.06] It has the potential for great misuse.
[4170.92 → 4172.90] And it's not very useful to me.
[4173.04 → 4174.56] And that's how I feel about AI.
[4174.74 → 4176.02] You could use it for ice carving.
[4176.02 → 4179.46] It's like a hatchet meat tenderizer.
[4180.24 → 4180.68] Sure.
[4181.00 → 4181.16] Yep.
[4181.38 → 4181.58] Yeah.
[4181.80 → 4182.00] Yeah.
[4182.16 → 4185.38] And you know, hey, power to the hatchet meat tenderizer users.
[4185.90 → 4190.78] If anyone knows what that tool is called, by the way, I'm like super interested to know.
[4190.98 → 4191.56] I have to go.
[4191.70 → 4191.94] Okay.
[4192.16 → 4192.66] Thanks, Riley.
[4192.76 → 4193.64] Thanks for joining us.
[4193.74 → 4199.60] This was a much less chaotic experience than the last time I crashed, you guys.
[4199.80 → 4200.10] Yeah.
[4200.10 → 4203.06] So have we grown up or have you?
[4203.06 → 4203.30] Disappointing or good?
[4203.46 → 4203.82] What's that?
[4203.96 → 4204.84] Is that good or disappointing?
[4205.80 → 4206.50] It's both.
[4206.64 → 4209.78] I feel like I like discussions, but I also just like disrupting you.
[4211.78 → 4212.18] Okay.
[4212.24 → 4212.94] Well, Godspeed.
[4214.26 → 4214.66] Bye.
[4217.20 → 4218.54] That's not the best for the audio.
[4219.22 → 4220.38] I mean...
[4220.38 → 4220.90] Okay.
[4222.36 → 4222.76] Fantastic.
[4222.76 → 4223.04] Fantastic.
[4223.58 → 4227.48] It didn't look like this quite, but this is sort of the...
[4227.48 → 4227.84] Huh.
[4228.00 → 4229.98] This is sort of the idea, I think.
[4230.76 → 4232.24] The tenderizing axe.
[4232.46 → 4233.92] The tenderizing axe.
[4234.04 → 4234.40] That's...
[4234.40 → 4234.74] Wow.
[4235.14 → 4238.02] Man, that sounds like a super weird, like...
[4238.02 → 4238.64] It's a good band name.
[4239.92 → 4240.92] Yeah, actually.
[4241.54 → 4242.40] Tenderizing axe.
[4242.44 → 4242.94] I like that.
[4243.18 → 4243.70] Clown metal.
[4243.70 → 4249.22] Anyway, we should do sponsors, maybe?
[4249.98 → 4251.54] Let's do our CW announcements.
[4251.84 → 4253.20] Oh, we have CW announcements.
[4253.34 → 4253.80] Of course we would.
[4253.82 → 4254.62] And sponsors after that.
[4254.96 → 4259.88] It's the magicalest time of the year.
[4260.04 → 4260.52] Hooray!
[4260.76 → 4266.04] Where the calendar's almost empty, and somehow we're still doing deals from now until December
[4266.04 → 4267.76] 25th.
[4267.76 → 4274.46] When you buy a commuter backpack, you will get a bonus $50 gift card.
[4274.98 → 4278.36] You will get a gift card that is redeemable in the new year.
[4278.96 → 4284.98] After January 1st, 2026, you can spend your $50 gift card.
[4285.48 → 4297.56] Also, and this is crazy, our original black shaft screwdrivers are back for a very short
[4297.56 → 4297.72] time.
[4297.78 → 4301.04] We found like a thousand of them in the warehouse.
[4302.00 → 4303.76] They were sitting there all this time.
[4303.92 → 4304.90] How does this keep happening?
[4304.90 → 4306.74] I don't know.
[4306.78 → 4310.16] How do you just find incredible amounts of things?
[4313.22 → 4317.26] It is a significant source of consternation for me.
[4317.32 → 4320.76] This is ignorance because I've never done something like that, but I just don't.
[4320.76 → 4327.18] Like, I might find something in the back of some closet I haven't gone into in a long
[4327.18 → 4327.70] time.
[4328.68 → 4332.70] Or like, you know, that box of like keepsakes from high school.
[4332.90 → 4335.22] But theoretically, we digitally track our assets.
[4336.24 → 4337.02] But yeah.
[4337.20 → 4339.26] How do you lose a thousand screwdrivers?
[4339.30 → 4340.24] Oh, it was more than a thousand.
[4340.34 → 4341.34] I just said a thousand.
[4341.92 → 4343.66] Is it more than two thousand?
[4343.88 → 4344.74] I don't think so.
[4344.74 → 4350.02] So it's so just for argument, let's say twelve hundred.
[4350.90 → 4351.22] Sure.
[4351.36 → 4352.14] Let's say that.
[4352.26 → 4354.30] That's a lot of dollars of things.
[4354.86 → 4355.20] Oh, yeah.
[4355.80 → 4356.20] Yeah.
[4356.20 → 4362.22] I wasn't like stoked to hear about it, but I was stoked to have, you know, a cool little
[4362.22 → 4364.58] drop for people for the end of the year.
[4364.90 → 4366.90] So do you want to fire up the site?
[4367.08 → 4368.22] We can show people where to find it.
[4368.22 → 4373.00] Just to be clear, guys, this is the same coating that we had before.
[4373.16 → 4376.72] So it will have the same chipping issues that the original coating had.
[4376.80 → 4381.12] If you do not like things to patina, then don't buy it.
[4381.42 → 4381.84] Please.
[4382.26 → 4383.68] Please don't buy it.
[4384.80 → 4388.04] But if you do like that, then that's great.
[4388.24 → 4390.14] I would, you know, love for you to love it.
[4390.88 → 4392.10] I'm just trying to find.
[4392.20 → 4396.46] I hate the way that Chrome on Android.
[4396.46 → 4402.02] It just opens up a news feed instead of just taking me to the last tab that I was using.
[4402.24 → 4404.54] And you have to like click continue to this tab.
[4404.64 → 4407.30] I got to find that setting and turn it off, assuming that it is a setting.
[4409.56 → 4411.38] Oh, wait.
[4411.72 → 4412.88] Is it on the site?
[4413.28 → 4414.56] I don't know.
[4415.96 → 4418.20] Oh, did anyone check?
[4418.48 → 4419.52] I don't see it.
[4421.74 → 4423.44] Oh, it's like on the homepage.
[4426.46 → 4427.02] Okay.
[4427.16 → 4429.38] No one put it in the screwdriver category.
[4429.52 → 4429.82] Okay.
[4430.12 → 4433.08] Well, we could maybe fix that.
[4433.30 → 4433.60] Yeah.
[4433.84 → 4434.08] Yep.
[4434.36 → 4434.48] Cool.
[4434.62 → 4434.82] All right.
[4435.08 → 4435.52] Sounds good.
[4436.06 → 4439.00] Oh, is it only on the global site?
[4439.10 → 4440.16] I mean, that would make sense.
[4440.32 → 4441.42] I checked on both.
[4441.42 → 4445.60] It is for sure on the front page though.
[4445.82 → 4446.62] So that, yep.
[4447.38 → 4448.10] Okay, cool.
[4449.04 → 4453.48] Well, apparently we still have stock, and you will also receive a $10 gift card with this,
[4453.56 → 4458.40] which will be emailed to you on January 1st, 2026 or thereabouts.
[4458.58 → 4459.82] Oh, it's also on the US site.
[4459.90 → 4460.92] How is it on the US site?
[4460.94 → 4462.34] If we just found it in the warehouse?
[4462.46 → 4463.88] Because we probably shipped some down.
[4464.12 → 4464.44] Oh.
[4464.70 → 4464.86] Yeah.
[4464.86 → 4469.32] What a wild, what a time to be, what a time to be alive.
[4469.48 → 4470.70] A commuter backpack though.
[4470.70 → 4470.90] It is for sure.
[4471.10 → 4471.42] $50.
[4471.68 → 4474.20] This is like one of our best reviewed products ever.
[4474.32 → 4477.70] People flipping love the commuter backpack.
[4478.84 → 4480.16] Absolutely great product.
[4481.32 → 4482.02] Go check it out.
[4482.10 → 4487.06] You get a $50 gift card with your order usable in the new year, and we will have plenty of cool
[4487.06 → 4488.36] stuff for people to check out next year.
[4488.36 → 4492.42] Since we're on the subject of screwdrivers, this is probably a good time to remind you
[4492.42 → 4497.10] guys that the Prismatic transparent screwdriver series is one week away.
[4497.32 → 4501.34] I'm just going to pull up the signup sheet here so you guys can see all the colours.
[4501.72 → 4504.34] Just go to Prismatic signup.
[4504.40 → 4505.18] Oh, that's so exciting.
[4505.34 → 4507.66] Do we have a vanity URL for this?
[4508.56 → 4508.98] Yes.
[4509.28 → 4512.66] leg.GG slash signup Prismatic.
[4512.74 → 4513.74] Okay, that is not...
[4513.74 → 4514.52] Oh, that's tough.
[4514.52 → 4516.94] Oh, man.
[4516.98 → 4518.36] Is there an easier way to navigate to that?
[4518.44 → 4518.56] Okay.
[4519.00 → 4520.40] Look, there...
[4520.40 → 4521.58] Is there two PS in that?
[4521.62 → 4522.32] We're pretty new.
[4522.32 → 4522.68] There is.
[4522.76 → 4524.28] We're pretty new to being a retailer.
[4524.68 → 4525.00] Okay?
[4525.30 → 4526.64] Dan's going to link it in the chat.
[4527.40 → 4528.64] The point is...
[4528.64 → 4529.34] What is it?
[4530.84 → 4531.58] Sign up.
[4532.16 → 4532.58] Sign up.
[4532.84 → 4533.22] Sign up.
[4533.22 → 4534.04] Double P.
[4534.08 → 4534.64] Okay, stop.
[4534.90 → 4535.76] Rio Magic.
[4535.92 → 4536.88] You're really not helping.
[4537.46 → 4538.64] You are the Rio Magic.
[4540.30 → 4541.52] I'm putting it in chat.
[4541.52 → 4546.36] Rio Magic actually sounds like a sick, like, DJ game.
[4547.20 → 4548.74] Hey, DJ Rio Magic.
[4549.20 → 4550.98] Back in again with a background house.
[4551.20 → 4551.54] Okay.
[4552.34 → 4554.98] It'll be available in Plasma, Purple...
[4554.98 → 4556.10] Indie, all the time.
[4556.16 → 4560.68] Carbon Black, Molten Orange, and Cry Teal.
[4560.90 → 4562.18] Those are my new singles.
[4563.44 → 4564.36] Got them on Spotify.
[4564.76 → 4565.88] Here's my SoundCloud.
[4566.16 → 4566.52] And...
[4566.52 → 4567.82] I can't spell my name, though.
[4567.82 → 4568.62] And...
[4568.62 → 4573.02] There may be a special surprise when they launch.
[4573.32 → 4573.52] Oh!
[4575.18 → 4576.20] Special surprise.
[4576.46 → 4577.02] What does that mean?
[4577.10 → 4583.24] They're launching on December 26th, so that's on Boxing Day, which for our American and global
[4583.24 → 4587.10] viewers is, like, Commonwealth Black Friday.
[4588.48 → 4592.40] Before we just also adopted Black Friday, and now we just have both.
[4592.40 → 4593.96] I have to...
[4593.96 → 4597.50] This is extremely unimportant, but I just really enjoy that when you refresh this page, it
[4597.50 → 4601.82] feels like the space where you're supposed to put your email in just, like, screams into
[4601.82 → 4602.36] existence.
[4605.20 → 4608.10] Thank you, Luke.
[4608.18 → 4608.86] That's very helpful.
[4610.42 → 4611.64] Once you see it, you cannot see it.
[4611.88 → 4615.12] Anyway, moving forward, more topics?
[4615.12 → 4615.20] Thanks.
[4618.24 → 4618.94] Oh, yeah.
[4618.96 → 4619.22] Okay.
[4619.46 → 4620.06] Yeah, sponsors.
[4620.40 → 4623.14] The show is brought to you today by MSI.
[4623.82 → 4628.90] This script was supposed to have something about how the sky is clearing up, and I was
[4628.90 → 4633.56] supposed to tie it into MSI's new MAG 272QPX50 monitor.
[4634.06 → 4638.30] But the weather has been so unpredictable that this line was rewritten three times.
[4638.30 → 4644.28] What is predictable, though, is the stunning image quality that you're going to get, thanks
[4644.28 → 4645.30] to...
[4645.30 → 4646.88] Wait, what?
[4650.30 → 4650.82] Uh...
[4650.82 → 4655.90] No, I'm just wondering what gen QD OLED panel it is.
[4656.68 → 4657.20] Third gen.
[4657.38 → 4657.60] Okay.
[4658.08 → 4663.82] Thanks to its third gen QD OLED panel and display HDR True Black 500.
[4664.32 → 4666.62] Games will not only look great, but feel great, too.
[4666.62 → 4676.58] Thanks to 0.03-millisecond gray-to-gray response times and a clear MR 21000 certification.
[4677.46 → 4677.82] Oh, yeah.
[4677.94 → 4681.00] And it's got a 500 hertz refresh rate.
[4682.14 → 4682.96] 500 hertz.
[4684.28 → 4686.64] I'm just going to take a moment to let that sink in.
[4686.88 → 4689.12] 500 hertz.
[4689.98 → 4694.22] Plus, if you're worried about the longevity of this bad boy, it comes with MSI's OLED Care
[4694.22 → 4697.32] 2.0 to drastically reduce the chance of that happening.
[4697.44 → 4700.42] And it's also covered by a three-year burn-in warranty.
[4700.72 → 4709.04] So get your game on today and pick up an MSI MAG 272QPQD OLED X50 monitor using our link
[4709.04 → 4710.60] in the video description.
[4711.18 → 4713.22] The show is also brought to you by...
[4713.22 → 4713.74] So where?
[4714.06 → 4715.18] A-sup-a-SA?
[4716.44 → 4716.84] Whoa!
[4717.24 → 4717.72] Whoa!
[4719.72 → 4719.98] What?
[4721.14 → 4725.42] Launching a business doesn't need to feel like rocket science.
[4725.48 → 4726.60] Okay, this has to be AI.
[4727.26 → 4728.56] Is this AI generated?
[4728.56 → 4732.88] Oh, okay, cool.
[4734.26 → 4736.46] Launching a business doesn't need to feel like rocket science.

[4786.72 → 4787.60] We'll have that link down below.
[4787.88 → 4790.96] Dan, I do want to do a couple topics before we do more sponsor spots.
[4791.48 → 4795.86] I also want to double-check what generation of OLED panel that monitor is using.
[4796.62 → 4800.14] So maybe Luke could pick a topic while I just check something.
[4800.48 → 4800.86] Sure.
[4805.60 → 4806.36] I'm good.
[4806.48 → 4807.12] Thank you very much.
[4807.12 → 4809.00] The Apocalypse continues.
[4809.74 → 4816.48] As RAM prices continue to rise, Dell, Lenovo, and Framework have all announced price increases
[4816.48 → 4820.12] and other changes due to DRAM shortage.
[4820.68 → 4824.10] Framework, investment disclosure for Mr. Linus Sebastian,
[4824.44 → 4831.48] says their DDR5 memory configs for their DIY edition laptops are going to go up by 50%,
[4831.48 → 4835.36] with possible plans to increase by even more later on.
[4835.36 → 4839.48] Dell emailed internal employees informing of price changes,
[4839.54 → 4842.40] including their Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks,
[4842.78 → 4851.04] going up between $520 and $765 for the 128 gig version,
[4851.22 → 4854.32] or $130 to $230 for the 32 gig models,
[4854.58 → 4859.26] with Trend force even predicting that Dell and Lenovo may be going backwards
[4859.26 → 4865.18] and limiting devices to only have 8 gigs of RAM and smaller storage capacity.
[4868.56 → 4869.44] Discussion question.
[4869.56 → 4870.32] Good luck, everybody.
[4870.92 → 4872.32] How do you stay excited about tech?
[4873.08 → 4875.84] It seems like its bad news after bad news,
[4876.20 → 4879.86] whether it's hardware pricing, shifting subscription-based models,
[4879.86 → 4881.64] or even frustrating video game news.
[4881.78 → 4883.98] What keeps you motivated to make tech content?
[4884.32 → 4886.78] Well, that's the world, I think.
[4887.20 → 4889.74] I think it's bad news after bad news,
[4889.98 → 4891.66] whether it's pricing of things,
[4891.92 → 4893.10] everything in the world,
[4893.28 → 4894.72] switching to subscription-based models,
[4894.86 → 4897.62] or just frustrating news about the things that we like.
[4897.62 → 4900.62] I'm going to come in here with a hot take
[4900.62 → 4904.06] that may actually end up being a full video on the channel,
[4904.16 → 4907.66] because this is going to ruffle some feathers.
[4908.02 → 4908.76] Oh, boy.
[4909.24 → 4913.28] But I think that we, as tech enjoyers,
[4914.16 → 4916.44] might just need a bit of a perspective adjustment.
[4917.66 → 4918.14] Huh.
[4918.32 → 4920.04] In the grand scheme of things,
[4920.18 → 4921.88] and maybe this is, again,
[4921.96 → 4923.92] I'm coming at it from my perspective, right?
[4923.92 → 4928.06] As a 90s kid, a gaming computer was like,
[4928.38 → 4931.38] started at thousands of 90s dollars.
[4932.52 → 4937.92] And today, today, in 2025 dollars,
[4938.90 → 4943.24] thousands of dollars will get you a sick gaming computer,
[4943.38 → 4945.66] even in the midst of a Apocalypse.
[4947.40 → 4950.16] There are other challenges that are putting pressure
[4950.16 → 4951.48] on disposable income.
[4951.98 → 4952.50] Yeah.
[4952.50 → 4954.24] I mean, you can say it sucks,
[4954.40 → 4956.78] but, like, if you compare it to...
[4956.78 → 4958.90] I don't think saying we need a perspective adjustment
[4958.90 → 4959.76] makes sense, though.
[4959.82 → 4962.64] When people's incomes are lower relative to costs,
[4962.94 → 4964.62] when things that are required for living,
[4964.78 → 4968.56] like health insurance, housing, food,
[4968.68 → 4969.34] all those types of things,
[4969.38 → 4970.64] those costs are going way up.
[4970.82 → 4970.96] 100%.
[4970.96 → 4974.12] The relative money to spend on things
[4974.12 → 4975.36] is significantly lower.
[4975.54 → 4978.32] So we don't have the luxury of spending that much
[4978.32 → 4980.16] on a for-fun computing device
[4980.16 → 4981.56] that someone may have had in the past.
[4981.56 → 4982.94] Let me expand on my point.
[4983.06 → 4983.32] Sure.
[4984.04 → 4985.22] Here's another big difference.
[4985.58 → 4987.26] Compared to when I was a kid.
[4987.30 → 4988.02] When I was a kid,
[4988.52 → 4991.76] if you were using a computer from 10 years prior,
[4992.22 → 4993.50] it was literal garbage.
[4993.98 → 4994.62] It was...
[4994.62 → 4998.44] But now you can play relatively modern games.
[4998.52 → 5000.24] Like, I have told the story a few times.
[5000.30 → 5001.20] I forget which game it was.
[5001.24 → 5002.10] It might have been Ark Raiders,
[5002.10 → 5003.66] but I've been telling the story a few times
[5003.66 → 5005.92] about the son of a buddy of mine
[5005.92 → 5008.16] who's playing on a 2500K
[5008.16 → 5009.44] and playing some modern game.
[5009.48 → 5010.46] I don't remember which one it was.
[5013.06 → 5014.76] So here's the...
[5014.76 → 5017.06] So that's the thing.
[5018.24 → 5019.88] Is a kid of RAM
[5019.88 → 5021.88] way too expensive right now?
[5022.20 → 5023.28] Am I paying...
[5023.28 → 5023.90] So here, hold on.
[5024.02 → 5025.10] Are you guys making that video?
[5025.50 → 5026.36] Because I've been refraining
[5026.36 → 5027.30] talking about the thing.
[5027.54 → 5028.40] You're making that...
[5028.40 → 5029.64] Not the one you just mentioned,
[5029.80 → 5031.28] but the one I messaged you about,
[5031.36 → 5032.14] the Marketplace one?
[5033.80 → 5034.36] Possibly.
[5034.50 → 5036.46] It turns out it might be stale already.
[5036.58 → 5038.50] DDR4 prices are skyrocketing.
[5038.74 → 5040.06] And more importantly,
[5040.66 → 5043.38] like, AM4 X3D chips
[5043.38 → 5044.64] are skyrocketing.
[5044.70 → 5046.94] Apparently 5,800 X3Ds are going for like...
[5046.94 → 5047.56] I was just figuring this out.
[5047.60 → 5049.98] I was hoping we'd make the video before then.
[5050.14 → 5051.00] So right now,
[5051.10 → 5052.40] a 16 gig kit of RAM
[5052.40 → 5054.34] is around 200 US dollars.
[5054.78 → 5056.30] What that means to the budget
[5056.30 → 5060.38] for like the $550 gaming PC
[5060.38 → 5061.82] that we built a little while ago
[5061.82 → 5062.84] that we did a video about
[5062.84 → 5064.62] with an ARC GPU
[5064.62 → 5067.00] and a reasonably priced CPU,
[5067.26 → 5068.84] kind of value power supply,
[5069.04 → 5070.56] is that you'd probably be adding
[5070.56 → 5074.02] about 100 to $140 to that budget.
[5074.62 → 5075.42] So today,
[5076.08 → 5077.84] in the midst of the Apocalypse,
[5077.84 → 5079.98] you can still build
[5079.98 → 5082.88] like a high-end 1080p,
[5083.62 → 5086.42] mid-tier 1440p gaming PC
[5086.42 → 5087.44] for like $700,
[5088.06 → 5092.16] which is a lot of money and stuff,
[5092.60 → 5095.06] but compared to just about
[5095.06 → 5097.00] any other hobby,
[5097.84 → 5099.56] tech and gaming have been
[5099.56 → 5101.72] more inflation-proof.
[5101.90 → 5102.78] Like, name one.
[5103.26 → 5103.68] Name anything.
[5103.68 → 5105.66] Yeah, this was a fascinating conversation
[5105.66 → 5107.74] around the price of video games
[5107.74 → 5108.30] going up.
[5108.96 → 5109.14] Yeah.
[5109.38 → 5111.50] It's just, I don't know.
[5111.54 → 5112.28] I can fully understand
[5112.28 → 5113.38] people still being frustrated.
[5113.52 → 5113.84] You're right.
[5113.84 → 5114.34] 100%.
[5114.34 → 5116.06] I think what you're saying is fair,
[5116.24 → 5117.98] but people's ability to buy it
[5117.98 → 5119.70] is still non-existent.
[5120.00 → 5121.44] So it like doesn't really matter.
[5121.54 → 5122.00] Well, hold on.
[5122.02 → 5123.32] Like it can be as reasonable
[5123.32 → 5124.02] as it wants.
[5124.08 → 5125.38] If I don't have the money to buy it,
[5125.40 → 5126.88] it's still annoying.
[5127.08 → 5127.56] Hold on.
[5127.70 → 5128.20] Hold on.
[5128.34 → 5128.80] Hold on.
[5128.80 → 5130.12] Because like, yeah,
[5130.20 → 5131.72] but you also don't need
[5131.72 → 5132.86] to buy something brand new,
[5132.94 → 5133.94] which is something that we have
[5133.94 → 5134.88] talked about so much
[5134.88 → 5135.46] on this channel.
[5135.98 → 5136.76] So that's where...
[5136.76 → 5137.24] But then you're saying
[5137.24 → 5138.44] price increases for those things
[5138.44 → 5139.20] are happening as well.
[5140.20 → 5140.56] Yes.
[5140.56 → 5141.82] If you go after like
[5141.82 → 5143.00] the hottest items.
[5143.50 → 5144.28] So if you want to buy
[5144.28 → 5146.20] like a 5800X3D, sure.
[5146.32 → 5147.24] But if you know what to look for.
[5147.36 → 5148.34] But if you know what to look for,
[5148.38 → 5149.94] which is what we're here for, right?
[5150.04 → 5151.28] I feel like DDR4 RAM, though,
[5151.30 → 5152.06] you're not really looking
[5152.06 → 5153.02] for specific parts.
[5153.14 → 5155.84] Everybody's just going to search DDR4.
[5157.24 → 5159.02] I don't know that it's the RAM
[5159.02 → 5160.54] that's as bad as the way
[5160.54 → 5163.40] that the accompanying components
[5163.40 → 5164.14] are also going up.
[5164.14 → 5166.06] So I'd need to look into it some more.
[5166.44 → 5167.66] This is one of those
[5167.66 → 5169.22] that we've kind of strummed
[5169.22 → 5170.76] what we basically want to talk about,
[5170.76 → 5173.24] but we haven't sort of nailed down
[5173.24 → 5174.98] what the exact concept is for the script.
[5175.08 → 5176.08] I mean, I can tell you this much.
[5176.40 → 5177.96] A secondhand kit of DDR4
[5177.96 → 5179.76] is definitely going to cost you
[5179.76 → 5183.14] as much as like $60 to $70 less
[5183.14 → 5184.54] than a brand-new kit of DDR5,
[5184.64 → 5186.82] which is a significant savings.
[5187.00 → 5189.08] That is a meaningful savings.
[5189.64 → 5191.22] I don't know if it was right when,
[5191.34 → 5192.52] but like relatively short
[5192.52 → 5194.18] after the announcements
[5194.18 → 5196.04] of these like RAM issues.
[5196.48 → 5198.30] If you went on like stuff
[5198.30 → 5199.36] like Facebook Marketplace, whatever,
[5199.36 → 5200.88] you could get a lot of DDR4
[5200.88 → 5203.20] for not a lot of money.
[5204.32 → 5205.80] So many chat talking about DDR3.
[5205.90 → 5207.70] You're starting to get pretty old.
[5208.22 → 5209.84] I wouldn't go back to DDR3.
[5210.06 → 5210.32] Yeah.
[5210.52 → 5212.52] I also don't think it's necessary
[5212.52 → 5214.66] to go back to DDR3.
[5215.36 → 5217.06] It depends on where you're at and stuff.
[5217.18 → 5218.28] Fire Panda Sasquatch asks,
[5218.36 → 5219.28] where are you pulling that from?
[5219.34 → 5221.04] I'm looking at eBay right now.
[5225.36 → 5226.40] So yeah, I don't know.
[5226.40 → 5229.92] I think it's one of those things
[5229.92 → 5232.54] where we can look at what's going on,
[5232.86 → 5235.48] where we've got the COVID crypto winter,
[5236.26 → 5237.90] you know, or so we had the crypto winter,
[5238.10 → 5239.54] which was exacerbated
[5239.54 → 5241.78] by the COVID silicon shortage.
[5242.42 → 5244.56] And then we had basically
[5244.56 → 5249.12] a multi-year sort of recovery from that,
[5249.12 → 5251.16] that as soon as it happened,
[5251.58 → 5255.22] literally, I think it was three weeks,
[5255.46 → 5256.50] two or three weeks
[5256.50 → 5260.02] after we recorded the MSRP PC video,
[5260.38 → 5260.98] where we were like,
[5261.06 → 5263.06] holy crap, for the first time in years,
[5263.18 → 5264.20] you can buy a PC
[5264.20 → 5266.38] where every component is at MSRP.
[5267.52 → 5269.04] RAM shortage hit, right?
[5269.28 → 5271.10] And so we can look at this
[5271.10 → 5271.70] and we can go,
[5272.70 → 5276.50] oh, well, building computers totally sucks
[5276.50 → 5277.80] and we should never do it again.
[5278.18 → 5278.82] Yeah, no.
[5279.38 → 5281.18] Or, or hear me out,
[5281.72 → 5283.86] just a second here,
[5284.72 → 5287.88] if we actually track
[5287.88 → 5292.44] compared to quite literally anything else,
[5292.82 → 5293.04] right?
[5293.08 → 5294.92] Like, look at what a board game cost.
[5295.22 → 5298.28] I just, I don't even necessarily disagree with you,
[5298.50 → 5302.06] but I would be remiss to not point out
[5302.06 → 5303.52] that it doesn't mean it doesn't suck.
[5303.52 → 5306.76] It doesn't mean that it's not going to push things out of
[5306.76 → 5309.18] acceptable ranges for people.
[5309.86 → 5311.04] Of course it doesn't suck.
[5311.20 → 5312.88] Or, of course it, of course it sucks.
[5313.26 → 5314.62] It totally sucks.
[5314.74 → 5316.28] I just, I think your opening of like,
[5316.34 → 5317.82] people need a whatever it was,
[5317.90 → 5319.34] reality check or whatever it was,
[5319.38 → 5320.66] is just not a...
[5320.66 → 5321.72] It's more that I've,
[5321.88 → 5324.32] I wish people were a little bit more appreciative
[5324.32 → 5326.50] of the work that goes into
[5326.50 → 5329.62] keeping these things as affordable as they are.
[5329.94 → 5332.38] We did that recent tour of Peoria.
[5332.38 → 5333.68] They're fab.
[5334.82 → 5335.38] Holy...
[5335.38 → 5337.20] Dude, anytime you see a fab at all,
[5337.32 → 5337.84] it's just like,
[5337.94 → 5340.30] dude, how the hell do I buy one of these things
[5340.30 → 5342.14] for the amount of dollars that I get it for?
[5342.30 → 5343.12] It's crazy.
[5343.28 → 5344.02] It's amazing.
[5344.18 → 5344.96] And so I'm,
[5345.16 → 5346.46] so basically what I'm doing is
[5346.46 → 5348.46] I'm coming fresh off of,
[5349.00 → 5350.72] off of the actual,
[5351.30 → 5353.18] like, literal miracle.
[5353.56 → 5353.78] Yeah.
[5353.78 → 5355.22] Like, the wonder of the world
[5355.22 → 5356.40] that it is
[5356.40 → 5359.34] that we can make a microprocessor at all.
[5360.66 → 5362.86] And then I'm going over into like,
[5363.48 → 5366.58] I'm so angry
[5366.58 → 5368.44] that the $500 computer
[5368.44 → 5370.28] is now $700
[5370.28 → 5374.02] when a $500 computer
[5374.02 → 5377.02] is a miracle in the first place.
[5377.12 → 5378.92] And so is a $700 computer.
[5378.92 → 5380.42] That doesn't mean you can't be annoyed
[5380.42 → 5380.92] about like,
[5381.24 → 5382.72] constant extreme collusion
[5382.72 → 5384.84] and all these other things going on.
[5385.18 → 5386.24] But it is still,
[5386.46 → 5387.46] yeah,
[5387.98 → 5388.60] it is still neat
[5388.60 → 5390.10] that our hobby is surprisingly cheap.
[5390.22 → 5391.04] And the fact that,
[5391.08 → 5393.34] the fact that over the last several years,
[5393.34 → 5394.48] we've gotten to the point
[5394.48 → 5395.62] where you literally
[5395.62 → 5397.12] do not have to give Microsoft
[5397.12 → 5398.20] a hundred of your dollars
[5398.20 → 5399.30] on top of all the hardware
[5399.30 → 5400.12] you bought anymore.
[5400.38 → 5400.76] Linux!
[5401.30 → 5402.24] That's so cool.
[5402.52 → 5403.58] Like, can we just,
[5403.70 → 5404.86] can be just
[5404.86 → 5407.32] take a breath for a second?
[5407.32 → 5408.52] It could be.
[5408.54 → 5409.66] And look at the positives.
[5410.02 → 5411.64] It could be interesting to,
[5411.96 → 5413.64] because I think this event,
[5414.20 → 5415.24] as hot as the used market
[5415.24 → 5417.08] has gotten at various times,
[5417.08 → 5418.64] it was mostly just for GPUs.
[5418.76 → 5419.60] I think this event
[5419.60 → 5421.00] is going to crank the used market
[5421.00 → 5422.78] for practically everything.
[5423.46 → 5424.80] I've done some searching
[5424.80 → 5425.88] since I sent that message.
[5426.14 → 5427.44] Doing a Scrappy Red war right now
[5427.44 → 5428.62] would just suck,
[5428.86 → 5429.22] I think,
[5429.78 → 5430.82] to be completely honest.
[5431.78 → 5433.40] But I think it would be interesting
[5433.40 → 5434.24] maybe,
[5434.58 → 5435.68] I don't know if we get the clicks,
[5435.86 → 5437.12] but making a video on like,
[5437.12 → 5438.82] how to try to validate hardware
[5438.82 → 5439.62] when buying stuff
[5439.62 → 5440.42] from a used market.
[5441.24 → 5441.86] I've done it.
[5441.86 → 5442.42] As best as you can.
[5442.52 → 5443.00] No one cared.
[5443.18 → 5443.68] No one cares?
[5443.76 → 5445.48] I try so hard
[5445.48 → 5446.52] to like,
[5447.36 → 5448.16] bring people
[5448.16 → 5448.94] to the like,
[5448.96 → 5450.32] secondhand water.
[5450.32 → 5451.16] There's good water here.
[5451.68 → 5453.04] There's perfect water here.
[5453.12 → 5453.68] Like I did that.
[5453.70 → 5454.54] You just gotta drink.
[5454.76 → 5456.32] I did a video called
[5456.32 → 5458.80] I Solved the GPU Price Crisis
[5458.80 → 5459.34] or whatever,
[5459.72 → 5460.66] where basically I just
[5460.66 → 5462.64] like bought a 3080 secondhand
[5462.64 → 5464.32] and showed how to,
[5464.92 → 5465.16] like,
[5465.26 → 5465.48] you know,
[5465.54 → 5466.36] what to look for
[5466.36 → 5467.38] to not get scammed
[5467.38 → 5468.80] and how to test it
[5468.80 → 5469.64] and how to validate it
[5469.64 → 5470.58] before you take it home
[5470.58 → 5471.04] and like,
[5472.04 → 5473.44] and how to pick one
[5473.44 → 5474.98] that has like a transferable warranty
[5474.98 → 5476.04] and like basically,
[5476.26 → 5476.40] yeah,
[5476.46 → 5477.98] it was like a mini Scrapyard Wars
[5477.98 → 5479.26] of just like buying a GPU.
[5479.52 → 5479.72] How to.
[5480.06 → 5481.68] Absolutely bombed.
[5481.76 → 5482.46] Video bombed.
[5482.46 → 5482.80] Tank.
[5482.94 → 5483.94] No one wants to hear it.
[5484.34 → 5484.52] Dude,
[5484.58 → 5485.98] I was at Willow yesterday.
[5486.18 → 5486.42] Yeah.
[5486.42 → 5491.26] Willow video in Langley based used place.
[5491.76 → 5493.54] And I was showing Emma
[5493.54 → 5495.06] like somewhat of this phenomenon
[5495.06 → 5496.72] because we were there together.
[5497.24 → 5498.00] I don't know if,
[5498.08 → 5498.92] I think she's been there before.
[5498.96 → 5499.26] I'm not sure.
[5499.66 → 5500.86] But I was pointing out like,
[5500.94 → 5501.12] look,
[5501.52 → 5504.34] there's Spider-Man 2 for PS5 right there
[5504.34 → 5506.32] behind the desk all sealed
[5506.32 → 5510.24] or there's Spider-Man 2 for PS5 right here
[5510.24 → 5513.34] on the other side of the counter unsealed
[5513.34 → 5516.24] and there's like a 30 something dollar difference
[5516.24 → 5517.86] it's the same game.
[5519.06 → 5519.86] Come on.
[5520.44 → 5522.18] And people will still walk in there
[5522.18 → 5523.18] and just buy the new one.
[5523.90 → 5524.46] It's like,
[5524.60 → 5524.88] damn.
[5525.34 → 5526.14] I can't.
[5526.14 → 5526.88] I can't.
[5527.90 → 5528.34] Yeah.
[5528.74 → 5530.08] I can't fathom it.
[5530.36 → 5530.98] It doesn't,
[5530.98 → 5532.60] it doesn't compute for me.
[5534.22 → 5534.70] Yeah.
[5537.22 → 5539.28] Something that you probably can fathom
[5539.28 → 5540.86] even though it does also suck.
[5541.16 → 5544.58] NVIDIA reports a planned 30 to 40% cut
[5544.58 → 5546.02] in GeForce GPU production
[5546.02 → 5547.58] in early 2026.
[5547.92 → 5548.94] It's being reported that NVIDIA
[5548.94 → 5550.48] plans to slash that production.
[5551.98 → 5552.64] You know,
[5552.72 → 5553.10] of course,
[5553.16 → 5554.94] it's being assumed that this is because of
[5554.94 → 5556.90] the run on memory chips.
[5557.46 → 5560.70] I think it's a lot more than that personally,
[5560.84 → 5561.36] but okay.
[5561.70 → 5564.94] The reports come from the Chinese board channels forum
[5564.94 → 5566.84] and news site Bench Life,
[5567.18 → 5568.76] whose supply chain sources claim
[5568.76 → 5570.06] that NVIDIA's production cuts
[5570.06 → 5573.92] will first hit the RTX 5060 Ti 16 gig
[5573.92 → 5576.60] and the RTX 5070 Ti.
[5577.06 → 5577.42] Oh,
[5577.56 → 5578.58] the ones that are like...
[5579.62 → 5579.96] Yep.
[5580.40 → 5580.58] Well,
[5580.62 → 5583.74] the 5070 Ti is the one that like kind of makes sense
[5583.74 → 5584.64] in NVIDIA's lineup.
[5586.42 → 5587.06] Very cool.
[5587.12 → 5589.42] We've used it for two recent build guides.
[5589.42 → 5592.54] NVIDIA could use the GDDR 7
[5592.54 → 5594.76] from those aforementioned mid-range cards
[5594.76 → 5596.28] to make more of their higher end,
[5596.36 → 5597.26] more expensive cards
[5597.26 → 5599.40] and ultimately make more money.
[5599.94 → 5601.36] That's for sure part of it.
[5601.88 → 5602.58] Discussion question.
[5602.82 → 5604.62] How might this indicate NVIDIA's
[5604.62 → 5606.26] pulling a reverse AMD
[5606.26 → 5608.36] by only manufacturing gaming GPUs
[5608.36 → 5610.62] focused on the top end of the market?
[5611.44 → 5612.12] Take them away, Dan.
[5612.12 → 5614.12] Make sure we have to look forward to...
[5615.64 → 5616.04] Like what?
[5616.84 → 5617.80] My ability to can.
[5617.98 → 5618.30] Oh,
[5618.40 → 5618.82] I see.
[5619.42 → 5619.86] Very good.
[5624.36 → 5626.94] I think they also just,
[5627.08 → 5627.34] man,
[5627.48 → 5628.18] don't care.
[5630.18 → 5633.12] I think they feel like a requirement
[5633.72 → 5635.12] to care about G-Force
[5635.12 → 5635.92] because of,
[5636.12 → 5637.02] I don't know,
[5637.22 → 5637.72] pedigree,
[5637.92 → 5638.28] history,
[5638.64 → 5639.32] old times,
[5639.66 → 5641.32] the horse that got us here
[5641.32 → 5642.12] type mentality,
[5642.74 → 5643.26] but...
[5643.26 → 5644.06] I think it's a tenth
[5644.06 → 5645.08] of their revenue now.
[5645.22 → 5646.48] When is the last time
[5646.48 → 5647.62] they talked about it
[5647.62 → 5648.74] in a way that is like,
[5649.22 → 5650.46] we care about this a lot.
[5651.68 → 5652.40] We care about
[5652.40 → 5653.46] raster performance
[5653.46 → 5654.08] and gaming.
[5654.34 → 5655.40] Even last CES,
[5655.84 → 5657.26] it was all just like
[5657.26 → 5658.94] how much AI enhances
[5658.94 → 5659.80] G-Force.
[5662.98 → 5663.42] Yeah,
[5663.52 → 5663.88] so why,
[5664.00 → 5664.62] and then like,
[5664.72 → 5665.68] look at how...
[5668.00 → 5668.68] And you know,
[5669.08 → 5670.52] I'm totally including myself
[5670.52 → 5670.94] in this.
[5671.32 → 5672.18] But look at how annoying
[5672.18 → 5672.66] we are
[5672.66 → 5673.84] compared to enterprise
[5673.84 → 5674.74] customers that'll just
[5674.74 → 5675.62] pay whatever
[5675.62 → 5677.08] and just want it
[5677.08 → 5678.82] as soon as they can get it.
[5678.92 → 5679.48] And if there's like
[5679.48 → 5680.10] weird problems,
[5680.20 → 5680.62] they'll just like
[5680.62 → 5681.20] work with you on it.
[5681.20 → 5682.10] They'll hire engineers
[5682.10 → 5683.42] to help fix it.
[5683.58 → 5683.76] Yeah.
[5684.94 → 5685.90] Enterprise customers
[5685.90 → 5686.98] that are getting
[5686.98 → 5687.90] crazy
[5687.90 → 5689.46] Baku bucks
[5689.46 → 5690.44] investment dollars
[5690.44 → 5692.52] aren't going to care.
[5692.86 → 5693.50] And so they're spending
[5693.50 → 5694.32] someone else's money.
[5694.44 → 5694.68] Yeah.
[5694.96 → 5695.14] Right?
[5695.20 → 5696.40] A customer who is spending
[5696.40 → 5697.36] their own money
[5697.36 → 5698.58] is always
[5698.58 → 5699.84] going to be
[5699.84 → 5700.74] an order of magnitude
[5700.74 → 5701.38] more difficult
[5701.38 → 5702.04] to deal with
[5702.04 → 5702.70] than a customer
[5702.70 → 5703.32] who is spending
[5703.32 → 5704.80] someone else's money.
[5704.92 → 5705.16] Yeah.
[5705.70 → 5706.16] Always.
[5707.16 → 5708.08] And especially
[5708.08 → 5708.82] when they're spending
[5708.82 → 5709.82] someone else's money
[5709.82 → 5710.68] to make money
[5710.68 → 5711.42] for themselves.
[5711.86 → 5712.50] And that is like
[5712.50 → 5713.92] a default for companies
[5713.92 → 5714.98] at pretty much any scale
[5714.98 → 5716.62] because you're an employee
[5716.62 → 5717.06] at a company,
[5717.10 → 5717.58] you're just spending
[5717.58 → 5718.30] your company money.
[5718.36 → 5719.36] It's not as like,
[5719.40 → 5720.04] you're not going to be
[5720.04 → 5721.06] as careful with it.
[5721.06 → 5722.60] But also,
[5723.16 → 5724.80] especially at this scale
[5724.80 → 5726.36] where we're talking like,
[5726.48 → 5727.30] hello, yes,
[5727.34 → 5728.30] I will take this many
[5728.30 → 5730.12] like container fulls
[5730.12 → 5730.98] of graphics cards,
[5731.10 → 5731.34] please.
[5735.02 → 5735.54] Yeah.
[5735.84 → 5737.00] Just remember,
[5737.46 → 5737.86] you know,
[5737.98 → 5738.96] just try to remember
[5738.96 → 5739.60] a little bit
[5739.60 → 5741.02] on the hopeful
[5741.02 → 5742.12] other side of this,
[5742.62 → 5744.72] how different companies acted.
[5745.02 → 5746.40] And then if you care,
[5746.52 → 5747.20] vote with your wallets.
[5747.64 → 5748.32] Zero asked
[5748.32 → 5749.34] an interesting question.
[5749.46 → 5750.82] How much has your badminton
[5750.82 → 5752.12] inflated
[5752.12 → 5754.38] compared to PCs
[5754.38 → 5755.48] over the time
[5755.48 → 5756.28] that you've been doing it?
[5756.68 → 5757.98] So since I used to play
[5757.98 → 5759.22] back at NCI,
[5759.96 → 5761.50] badminton has gotten
[5761.50 → 5763.22] substantially more expensive.
[5763.52 → 5763.96] Rackets?
[5764.14 → 5764.58] Actually,
[5764.80 → 5765.66] not too bad.
[5766.02 → 5767.06] So they have benefited
[5767.06 → 5768.70] from increased economies
[5768.70 → 5769.30] of scale
[5769.30 → 5771.08] and better mass production
[5771.08 → 5771.74] techniques
[5771.74 → 5773.04] and more automation.
[5773.16 → 5773.92] Probably not the birdies.
[5774.56 → 5775.08] Actually,
[5775.58 → 5776.48] shuttles are brutal.
[5776.74 → 5776.92] Yeah.
[5777.38 → 5779.22] So badminton shuttles are...
[5779.22 → 5779.58] This is what I meant.
[5779.80 → 5780.38] Oh, I see.
[5780.38 → 5781.48] are being impacted
[5781.48 → 5783.76] by a major worldwide shortage
[5783.76 → 5784.72] in goose feathers.
[5785.68 → 5786.12] Specifically,
[5786.40 → 5787.58] the ones off the left wing
[5787.58 → 5788.08] of the goose
[5788.08 → 5788.94] because the shuttle
[5788.94 → 5789.58] has to spin
[5789.58 → 5790.42] a particular way
[5790.42 → 5791.42] and if you use the feathers
[5791.42 → 5792.12] from the right wing,
[5792.18 → 5793.10] they'll spin the other way.
[5794.24 → 5795.18] And also,
[5795.50 → 5796.00] court time.
[5796.24 → 5796.46] So,
[5796.86 → 5797.72] I'm going to shout out
[5797.72 → 5798.68] some of my buds
[5798.68 → 5800.32] who run
[5800.32 → 5801.54] or work at
[5801.54 → 5802.46] some courts
[5802.46 → 5803.28] in the Lower Mainland.
[5803.62 → 5805.12] When I got into...
[5805.12 → 5806.34] When I got into badminton,
[5806.44 → 5807.62] it was about 20 bucks an hour
[5807.62 → 5808.58] to rent a court.
[5809.02 → 5809.14] So,
[5809.24 → 5809.72] ERIC,
[5810.22 → 5810.86] where my buddy
[5810.86 → 5811.88] Jason Shut works,
[5812.58 → 5814.16] they are now charging
[5814.16 → 5816.98] $30.
[5817.44 → 5818.26] That's weekdays
[5818.26 → 5819.48] before 5 p.m.
[5819.92 → 5820.76] That is like...
[5820.76 → 5821.86] That is like
[5821.86 → 5822.60] the garbage time,
[5822.66 → 5823.28] the slow time.
[5823.62 → 5823.88] So,
[5823.92 → 5825.90] it's $36 an hour.
[5826.26 → 5826.34] So,
[5826.40 → 5827.06] that's over a span
[5827.06 → 5828.12] of about...
[5828.12 → 5828.36] So,
[5828.42 → 5829.38] this would be about
[5829.38 → 5832.02] the NCI time.
[5832.10 → 5832.18] So,
[5832.18 → 5832.96] this is just shy
[5832.96 → 5833.54] of 20 years.
[5833.88 → 5834.10] So,
[5834.14 → 5834.80] this is going back
[5834.80 → 5836.02] to like 2008
[5836.02 → 5837.74] or so.
[5837.80 → 5839.50] Why does it just say...
[5839.50 → 5839.90] What's up?
[5840.24 → 5840.60] Package.
[5840.72 → 5840.98] Oh,
[5841.10 → 5841.38] yeah.
[5841.46 → 5842.74] If you buy a bunch,
[5843.04 → 5844.52] then you can get a...
[5844.52 → 5845.70] It's a slight deal.
[5845.78 → 5846.68] It's honestly not that much.
[5846.80 → 5847.20] I'll show it up
[5847.20 → 5847.82] with my buddy Ringo.
[5848.74 → 5849.66] How much does
[5849.66 → 5851.42] a court rental...
[5851.42 → 5852.42] Ringo,
[5852.58 → 5852.96] where the heck
[5852.96 → 5854.12] is your court rental price?
[5855.12 → 5855.60] Wasn't that
[5855.60 → 5856.44] what we were just looking at?
[5856.58 → 5856.74] Yeah,
[5856.76 → 5857.38] it was a different site.
[5858.04 → 5858.40] Oh.
[5859.12 → 5860.06] Stringing service lesson.
[5860.68 → 5861.04] FAQ.
[5861.18 → 5861.50] Where's your
[5861.50 → 5862.62] where's your price Ringo?
[5863.96 → 5864.20] Okay,
[5864.30 → 5864.58] well,
[5864.70 → 5866.80] I'm trying to...
[5866.80 → 5866.94] Oh,
[5867.02 → 5868.46] there we go.
[5868.56 → 5868.84] All right.
[5868.98 → 5869.36] It's hiding.
[5870.20 → 5870.32] Wait,
[5870.34 → 5870.82] I just call?
[5873.16 → 5873.56] Oh,
[5873.62 → 5873.92] here we go.
[5873.96 → 5874.30] Here we go.
[5874.84 → 5875.18] Yeah,
[5875.34 → 5876.12] 34 bucks.
[5876.68 → 5877.38] Going up.
[5878.04 → 5879.08] Going up in January.
[5879.48 → 5879.94] Clear one.
[5880.38 → 5881.32] Shout out my boy Daryl.
[5882.40 → 5883.12] Let's see.
[5883.88 → 5884.10] Yeah,
[5884.18 → 5884.44] Richmond.
[5886.74 → 5887.52] Here we go.
[5888.52 → 5888.92] So,
[5889.04 → 5889.12] yeah,
[5889.20 → 5889.80] 20 bucks
[5889.80 → 5891.08] has gone up to
[5891.08 → 5892.58] Oh.
[5892.82 → 5893.12] Sure,
[5893.22 → 5893.54] why not?
[5894.62 → 5894.98] Oh,
[5894.98 → 5896.20] oh my God.
[5896.90 → 5897.32] All right,
[5897.32 → 5897.86] all right,
[5897.92 → 5899.22] here we go.
[5899.90 → 5900.36] Court rental,
[5900.50 → 5901.06] 30 bucks.
[5903.24 → 5904.86] And Daryl's,
[5905.82 → 5907.28] if you can get a court there,
[5907.36 → 5908.24] because he's really focused
[5908.24 → 5909.44] on training at his facility,
[5909.94 → 5910.90] he actually runs
[5910.90 → 5911.84] the training programs
[5911.84 → 5913.28] for us at Smash Champs.
[5913.58 → 5914.82] I would use
[5914.82 → 5915.78] Smash Champs
[5915.78 → 5916.56] as an example,
[5916.68 → 5917.46] but what's the point of that?
[5917.46 → 5918.58] That's a facility
[5918.58 → 5919.26] that I control
[5919.26 → 5919.98] the pricing of
[5919.98 → 5921.12] and that doesn't
[5921.12 → 5922.30] have a long history.
[5922.64 → 5923.82] But all of these places
[5923.82 → 5924.48] would have been closer
[5924.48 → 5925.32] to about 20 bucks
[5925.32 → 5926.22] an hour back in the day.
[5926.36 → 5927.52] And a tube of shuttles
[5927.52 → 5928.58] would have been like
[5928.58 → 5930.30] 20,
[5930.38 → 5931.28] 25 bucks.
[5931.46 → 5932.34] Whereas now,
[5932.34 → 5934.56] a top tier
[5934.56 → 5936.14] Yonex shuttle
[5936.14 → 5937.02] is like,
[5937.26 → 5937.86] I think,
[5937.98 → 5938.86] approaching $100
[5938.86 → 5939.96] Canadian retail
[5939.96 → 5941.58] for like Goose Feather.
[5941.82 → 5942.86] So very few people
[5942.86 → 5943.76] are playing with Goose Feather
[5943.76 → 5945.36] and like the lower end ones
[5945.36 → 5946.04] are more like
[5946.04 → 5946.90] 40 plus.
[5947.04 → 5947.94] You're talking a tube,
[5948.08 → 5948.18] yeah?
[5948.48 → 5948.70] Yeah,
[5948.84 → 5949.78] 12 shuttles.
[5950.00 → 5950.06] Yeah.
[5950.64 → 5951.32] It's been
[5951.32 → 5953.36] absolutely brutal.
[5953.46 → 5954.22] I was chatting with
[5954.22 → 5955.58] a buddy who runs
[5955.58 → 5956.12] a bunch of clubs
[5956.12 → 5956.58] in Taiwan
[5956.58 → 5957.18] and he's like,
[5957.22 → 5957.34] yeah,
[5957.40 → 5958.68] this has the potential
[5958.68 → 5959.50] to kill our sport
[5959.50 → 5961.66] if it just gets
[5961.66 → 5962.74] too unaffordable.
[5963.44 → 5965.02] Would people accept
[5965.02 → 5967.18] lower quality shuttles?
[5967.78 → 5968.10] Yes.
[5968.10 → 5968.72] Or are you talking
[5968.72 → 5969.56] about court rentals?
[5971.22 → 5972.52] Navy Ry mar says,
[5972.58 → 5973.54] shouting out a competitor
[5973.54 → 5974.36] is based.
[5974.98 → 5975.70] I don't,
[5976.82 → 5978.68] I have always
[5978.68 → 5979.82] There's a different view.
[5980.26 → 5982.30] had a bit of a different view
[5982.30 → 5983.54] on competition.
[5983.78 → 5985.12] I think that competition
[5985.12 → 5985.94] is healthy.
[5986.42 → 5987.68] I think it is good
[5987.68 → 5988.44] for the consumer.
[5988.44 → 5990.00] I think that you can have
[5990.00 → 5991.80] competition without animosity.
[5992.06 → 5993.28] I think that you can have
[5993.28 → 5994.76] friendly rivalry.
[5995.08 → 5996.32] Do I compete
[5996.32 → 5997.82] with Ringo
[5997.82 → 5998.56] and Jason
[5998.56 → 5999.80] and Daryl?
[6000.10 → 6000.66] Yes.
[6001.00 → 6002.04] Can we collaborate?
[6003.30 → 6003.86] Yes.
[6004.00 → 6004.90] There's also this idea
[6004.90 → 6005.34] that like,
[6005.40 → 6006.70] if you all together
[6006.70 → 6008.64] make the sport of badminton
[6008.64 → 6010.00] more popular
[6010.00 → 6010.74] in the area,
[6010.80 → 6011.84] you just all win.
[6012.20 → 6012.94] This is the
[6012.94 → 6014.08] the whole rising tide thing.
[6014.16 → 6015.10] It applies to so many
[6015.10 → 6016.04] different realms
[6016.04 → 6016.84] that people realize
[6016.84 → 6017.20] it's,
[6017.30 → 6017.90] this is not,
[6017.90 → 6020.10] Smash Champs also
[6020.10 → 6020.70] isn't in,
[6020.82 → 6021.54] you didn't open one
[6021.54 → 6022.32] next door.
[6022.96 → 6023.16] Yeah.
[6023.30 → 6023.52] Yeah.
[6023.64 → 6024.52] And why would I?
[6024.62 → 6025.44] Different market.
[6025.74 → 6026.46] Why should I?
[6026.72 → 6026.94] Yeah.
[6027.86 → 6029.12] Heck, I'll shout out
[6029.12 → 6030.00] my boy Melissa.
[6030.70 → 6031.34] Whatever, boy.
[6031.86 → 6032.80] Don't worry about it.
[6033.06 → 6033.72] The point is,
[6033.88 → 6034.66] Sumo Pro Shop,
[6035.04 → 6035.64] good shop.
[6035.80 → 6036.36] We're competing
[6036.36 → 6037.06] with them hard.
[6037.24 → 6037.72] We're probably
[6037.72 → 6038.70] going to go into e-tail
[6038.70 → 6039.48] and we're going to,
[6039.48 → 6040.22] we're going to compete
[6040.22 → 6041.00] with them online.
[6041.72 → 6042.44] That's fine.
[6042.44 → 6043.64] I can still respect
[6043.64 → 6044.36] the hell out of
[6044.36 → 6045.50] Melissa's hustle and,
[6045.58 → 6046.50] and ideally you're
[6046.50 → 6047.12] bringing more people
[6047.12 → 6047.54] to the space.
[6047.66 → 6048.30] And we can both
[6048.30 → 6049.10] make each other better
[6049.10 → 6049.74] and it'll be great.
[6049.82 → 6050.60] Everyone will be happy.
[6050.80 → 6050.96] Yeah.
[6051.76 → 6052.98] And sometimes
[6052.98 → 6054.42] someone will not be happy
[6054.42 → 6055.10] and they will get out
[6055.10 → 6055.48] competed,
[6055.48 → 6056.50] but I think then
[6056.50 → 6057.10] they need to,
[6057.20 → 6057.84] they need to reflect.
[6057.84 → 6058.46] They need to look
[6058.46 → 6058.84] in the mirror.
[6059.12 → 6060.40] I believe in healthy
[6060.40 → 6060.84] competition.
[6060.84 → 6061.60] And if that's me,
[6061.60 → 6062.46] then what I need to do
[6062.46 → 6063.06] is I need to look
[6063.06 → 6063.42] in the mirror
[6063.42 → 6064.14] and I have to figure out
[6064.14 → 6064.72] how to do it better.
[6065.58 → 6066.26] So yeah,
[6066.30 → 6066.48] no,
[6066.56 → 6066.80] I'm,
[6067.14 → 6069.14] and I walk this walk.
[6069.14 → 6070.06] In a lot of healthy
[6070.06 → 6070.96] competition environments,
[6070.96 → 6073.60] people will help each other
[6073.60 → 6075.22] compete against each other
[6075.22 → 6075.68] often.
[6076.36 → 6077.16] Like it's,
[6077.28 → 6078.40] because it's not about
[6078.40 → 6079.80] crushing the other party.
[6079.80 → 6080.88] It's about doing better.
[6081.30 → 6082.76] And if you're all like
[6082.76 → 6084.28] just killing it,
[6084.48 → 6085.36] it's very likely
[6085.36 → 6086.06] that your industry
[6086.06 → 6086.88] is just going to grow.
[6087.44 → 6087.88] Yes.
[6087.96 → 6088.50] Cause if you're all
[6088.50 → 6089.74] actually doing that well,
[6089.74 → 6090.58] it's probably going to be
[6090.58 → 6092.02] an exciting place to be
[6092.02 → 6092.60] for,
[6092.70 → 6093.28] for consumers
[6093.28 → 6094.16] and everyone else there
[6094.16 → 6094.74] and your industry
[6094.74 → 6095.44] is just going to grow
[6095.44 → 6095.90] and it's just going to be
[6095.90 → 6096.44] perfect.
[6098.48 → 6098.92] Yeah.
[6099.14 → 6102.68] Okay.
[6103.88 → 6104.42] What do you want
[6104.42 → 6105.12] to talk about next?
[6105.46 → 6106.64] I'm scrolling through.
[6107.28 → 6108.86] I can save my story time
[6108.86 → 6110.16] about Nine bot's
[6110.16 → 6111.52] terrible customer service
[6111.52 → 6112.18] for next week.
[6112.84 → 6113.48] It's not even
[6113.48 → 6114.46] terrible customer service.
[6114.56 → 6115.24] Their customer service
[6115.24 → 6115.86] was pretty good,
[6115.92 → 6116.60] but I'm not happy
[6116.60 → 6117.36] with the resolution.
[6117.64 → 6118.56] We should talk about that,
[6118.60 → 6118.96] but maybe,
[6119.08 → 6119.22] yeah,
[6119.22 → 6119.76] let's do that.
[6119.88 → 6120.22] Ooh,
[6120.30 → 6120.94] next week's probably
[6120.94 → 6121.60] also not going to be
[6121.60 → 6122.10] super long.
[6122.18 → 6122.34] Well,
[6122.46 → 6123.00] we'll see how it goes.
[6123.14 → 6123.46] Okay.
[6125.28 → 6126.58] My whole thing has changed.
[6126.66 → 6128.12] I can just do it
[6128.12 → 6128.66] at the normal time.
[6128.70 → 6128.94] It's fine.
[6128.94 → 6129.34] Okay.
[6129.54 → 6130.22] You do whatever
[6130.22 → 6130.84] works for you.
[6132.42 → 6132.82] Oh,
[6133.02 → 6134.02] what day of the week
[6134.02 → 6134.66] is it next week?
[6134.76 → 6135.24] Are we going to be
[6135.24 → 6136.22] spending Christmas together?
[6136.30 → 6136.44] No.
[6136.60 → 6137.02] Boxing Day.
[6137.26 → 6137.38] Yeah.
[6137.56 → 6137.80] 20,
[6137.96 → 6139.42] next year is Christmas day.
[6140.48 → 6140.88] Okay,
[6141.00 → 6141.26] cool.
[6142.48 → 6142.74] Actually,
[6142.76 → 6143.36] that'll still be fine.
[6143.36 → 6145.66] Okay.
[6146.04 → 6146.52] Uh,
[6146.58 → 6146.92] there's,
[6146.98 → 6147.26] I mean,
[6147.30 → 6149.08] there's the tech house plans.
[6149.18 → 6150.84] There's a 3D printing farm.
[6151.28 → 6151.58] Uh,
[6151.66 → 6151.98] Oh,
[6152.12 → 6152.90] LTT sells,
[6153.06 → 6153.34] uh,
[6153.34 → 6154.86] fake PTM 7950.
[6155.52 → 6155.84] Oh,
[6156.84 → 6157.90] just kidding.
[6157.90 → 6158.42] Uh,
[6158.46 → 6159.68] Igor's lab published a review
[6159.68 → 6161.36] of our PTM 7950 titled
[6161.36 → 6163.94] Linus Tech Tips PTM 7950 review,
[6164.20 → 6165.82] original OEM product
[6165.82 → 6166.94] or fake?
[6167.94 → 6169.34] Proud to say that we got
[6169.34 → 6170.48] Igor's lab,
[6170.54 → 6171.12] uh,
[6171.12 → 6171.96] badge of approval.
[6172.22 → 6173.36] It's the genuine article.
[6173.54 → 6175.48] Thanks for the extensive testing.
[6175.70 → 6176.18] And also,
[6176.18 → 6176.94] uh,
[6178.04 → 6178.44] the
[6178.54 → 6180.14] the writers of this included a quote,
[6180.22 → 6181.34] which I also love.
[6181.34 → 6182.68] So I'm happy they included this quote.
[6183.94 → 6186.78] This pad is from the edge of the cake
[6186.78 → 6189.04] among the PTM 7950 products,
[6189.20 → 6191.42] not intended for industrial showcases,
[6191.56 → 6192.66] but fully fledged,
[6192.92 → 6193.32] powerful,
[6193.32 → 6194.32] and in practice,
[6194.54 → 6196.14] at least as good
[6196.14 → 6198.80] as what is otherwise lying perfectly cut
[6198.80 → 6199.64] in the display.
[6200.22 → 6200.92] And sometimes,
[6201.38 → 6202.96] as I knew,
[6203.06 → 6203.90] even as a child,
[6204.26 → 6206.52] these are the pieces with the best bite.
[6208.02 → 6209.88] I actually love that.
[6210.20 → 6210.56] TLDR,
[6210.56 → 6211.28] it's all good.
[6212.02 → 6212.50] Um,
[6213.42 → 6213.70] yeah,
[6213.82 → 6214.18] uh,
[6214.18 → 6216.14] I exchanged a handful of emails
[6216.14 → 6217.76] with Igor about this.
[6217.94 → 6218.38] Um,
[6219.36 → 6219.50] I,
[6219.66 → 6219.90] you know,
[6219.96 → 6221.04] from my point of view,
[6221.08 → 6221.32] I,
[6221.40 → 6221.62] I,
[6221.74 → 6223.40] I appreciate,
[6223.80 → 6226.76] I appreciate his passion
[6226.76 → 6227.66] for the subject.
[6228.66 → 6230.80] That is what I can say
[6230.80 → 6231.66] is,
[6231.74 → 6232.14] you know,
[6232.44 → 6233.78] if there was ever
[6233.78 → 6235.64] a concern that you had
[6235.64 → 6237.90] that there was nobody out there
[6237.90 → 6240.68] like obsessively validating
[6240.68 → 6241.56] thermal compound,
[6242.06 → 6245.52] you can lay that concern to rest.
[6246.96 → 6248.42] Because Igor
[6248.42 → 6251.44] is obsessively evaluating
[6251.44 → 6252.36] thermal compound.
[6252.36 → 6252.76] Sick.
[6252.76 → 6254.46] I wouldn't have thought it's possible
[6254.46 → 6255.56] to write
[6255.56 → 6257.84] a five-page review
[6257.84 → 6258.84] of,
[6260.18 → 6260.80] because,
[6260.94 → 6261.48] it's,
[6261.52 → 6263.14] it's just PTM 7950.
[6263.58 → 6263.78] Like,
[6263.82 → 6264.14] we just,
[6264.48 → 6265.12] we're pretty,
[6265.74 → 6266.16] I,
[6266.22 → 6267.36] I think as transparent
[6267.36 → 6268.66] as we can possibly be.
[6268.78 → 6270.08] I did not develop
[6270.08 → 6271.08] a thermal compound.
[6271.30 → 6271.50] No.
[6271.50 → 6272.94] I do not have the engineering
[6272.94 → 6274.84] and or manufacturing
[6274.84 → 6276.02] expertise
[6276.02 → 6277.06] or capital
[6277.06 → 6278.08] to develop
[6278.08 → 6279.66] an industry-leading
[6279.66 → 6280.46] thermal compound.
[6280.74 → 6281.92] I accept that.
[6282.16 → 6282.42] I,
[6282.42 → 6283.76] I accept that about myself
[6283.76 → 6285.06] and my business acumen
[6285.06 → 6285.70] and resources.
[6286.32 → 6286.66] Um,
[6286.80 → 6287.12] so,
[6287.32 → 6288.04] what I did
[6288.04 → 6288.82] is,
[6289.06 → 6289.74] I took a thing
[6289.74 → 6290.56] that exists already
[6290.56 → 6291.74] that someone told us
[6291.74 → 6292.14] was good
[6292.14 → 6293.32] and that we validated
[6293.32 → 6295.00] we thought was pretty cool too
[6295.00 → 6296.48] and then really smart people
[6296.48 → 6297.60] have told us is perfect
[6297.60 → 6299.26] and then we made a box.
[6299.26 → 6301.94] Really skinny box.
[6302.06 → 6302.68] It's so skinny.
[6303.44 → 6304.26] It is a skinny box.
[6304.28 → 6304.86] It's a skinny box.
[6304.98 → 6305.62] Colourful too.
[6305.68 → 6306.34] It's got orange on it.
[6306.78 → 6307.58] We made it.
[6307.84 → 6308.56] Three colours.
[6308.66 → 6309.84] We put it right on there.
[6310.08 → 6310.32] Yep.
[6310.64 → 6311.32] We did it.
[6311.58 → 6311.84] Yep.
[6312.02 → 6312.36] Go Reddit.
[6313.22 → 6313.58] Um,
[6313.70 → 6314.76] and,
[6314.92 → 6315.24] uh,
[6315.24 → 6317.68] and so,
[6317.94 → 6318.84] I wouldn't have thought
[6318.84 → 6320.12] that it was possible
[6320.12 → 6321.72] to write a five-page article
[6321.72 → 6322.58] about our endeavours
[6322.58 → 6323.64] to put a box
[6323.64 → 6324.70] on a product that existed,
[6325.28 → 6325.54] uh,
[6325.54 → 6326.32] but he did it.
[6326.66 → 6327.74] And with Flair
[6327.74 → 6328.36] as,
[6328.52 → 6328.74] uh,
[6328.74 → 6329.76] as,
[6329.76 → 6330.66] as Luke pointed out,
[6330.74 → 6331.56] maybe even
[6331.56 → 6332.68] with the minimum
[6332.68 → 6334.74] 16 pieces of Flair.
[6336.06 → 6337.08] I thought it was pretty great.
[6337.28 → 6337.72] And honestly,
[6337.86 → 6338.26] it's a
[6338.26 → 6339.56] it's a fair enough question,
[6339.56 → 6340.32] uh,
[6340.32 → 6341.08] because apparently
[6341.08 → 6342.36] this is like a thing
[6342.36 → 6343.42] that it's faked often
[6343.42 → 6345.04] and it's like hard to find.
[6345.28 → 6346.24] Which is why we sourced it
[6346.24 → 6346.92] in the first place.
[6347.12 → 6347.66] Difficult to get it
[6347.66 → 6348.70] from the official company
[6348.70 → 6349.20] and,
[6349.28 → 6349.64] and,
[6349.64 → 6350.82] and all that jazz.
[6351.08 → 6352.68] But we didn't,
[6352.68 → 6353.14] um,
[6353.20 → 6353.40] we,
[6353.50 → 6354.60] we didn't source it
[6354.60 → 6355.72] from a fake source.
[6355.84 → 6355.94] Yeah.
[6355.94 → 6356.98] So there was,
[6357.26 → 6358.30] there was no concern
[6358.30 → 6359.08] in my mind
[6359.08 → 6359.54] that,
[6359.80 → 6360.14] you know,
[6360.18 → 6361.06] we were selling
[6361.06 → 6362.76] fake PTM 7950.
[6363.26 → 6363.74] Um,
[6363.84 → 6364.02] yeah,
[6364.02 → 6364.50] but if someone's
[6364.50 → 6365.10] asking,
[6365.14 → 6365.70] I appreciate that
[6365.70 → 6366.76] Igor answered it.
[6366.96 → 6367.34] Yep.
[6367.54 → 6367.86] Yep.
[6368.42 → 6368.76] I mean,
[6368.76 → 6368.98] I,
[6369.10 → 6369.38] uh,
[6369.88 → 6370.36] yeah,
[6370.42 → 6370.98] that's good.
[6372.56 → 6373.00] Nice.
[6373.56 → 6374.86] And sick quote.
[6375.52 → 6376.82] It's so awesome.
[6377.50 → 6379.18] It's actually just a great read.
[6380.06 → 6380.46] Um,
[6380.46 → 6381.48] are we talking about
[6381.48 → 6382.54] your Wikipedia article
[6382.54 → 6383.76] in float plane chat right now?
[6383.96 → 6384.22] Yeah.
[6384.22 → 6385.36] I didn't know this was a thing.
[6385.64 → 6385.88] Yeah.
[6385.94 → 6386.20] I,
[6386.24 → 6386.46] uh,
[6386.46 → 6387.96] I caught this earlier this week.
[6388.24 → 6388.68] Uh,
[6388.68 → 6390.50] so someone attempted
[6390.50 → 6393.86] to create a Wikipedia entry
[6393.86 → 6394.48] for Mr.
[6394.58 → 6395.44] Luke Cafetière,
[6396.28 → 6396.80] um,
[6396.96 → 6397.84] who was declined
[6397.84 → 6399.28] for not being notable enough,
[6399.36 → 6400.40] but I actually take,
[6400.72 → 6401.10] no,
[6401.20 → 6402.26] hold on a second.
[6403.34 → 6404.24] I actually,
[6404.58 → 6406.60] was it actually,
[6406.78 → 6408.02] which one's that?
[6408.18 → 6408.72] Where's that one?
[6408.72 → 6410.96] Oh,
[6411.06 → 6411.22] that,
[6411.30 → 6412.38] that's what people said on Reddit.
[6412.56 → 6414.00] I actually don't see that in the
[6414.00 → 6414.42] uh,
[6415.10 → 6416.04] that's funny though.
[6416.22 → 6416.52] Hold on.
[6416.56 → 6416.84] That is,
[6416.90 → 6418.78] they do not show significant coverage
[6418.78 → 6420.08] about the subject in published.
[6420.20 → 6420.40] Yeah.
[6420.74 → 6421.00] Yeah.
[6421.00 → 6421.48] Basically.
[6421.66 → 6421.98] Yeah.
[6421.98 → 6422.50] Pretty much.
[6422.76 → 6423.02] Based.
[6423.22 → 6423.66] Um,
[6423.78 → 6424.76] however,
[6425.02 → 6425.70] however,
[6426.44 → 6426.92] however,
[6426.92 → 6428.40] I actually,
[6428.72 → 6428.98] I,
[6429.04 → 6430.72] I think that that might be
[6430.72 → 6432.52] a self-promotion issue for you.
[6432.86 → 6434.62] So one of the things
[6434.62 → 6436.62] that makes someone notable
[6436.62 → 6438.70] is how often they've been covered
[6438.70 → 6440.40] in third party media.
[6441.38 → 6442.36] But I,
[6442.48 → 6443.36] we've talked about this
[6443.36 → 6444.42] a fair bit in the past
[6444.42 → 6446.52] where I will often get,
[6446.68 → 6447.04] like,
[6447.52 → 6448.72] spam to my inbox
[6448.72 → 6449.54] that's like,
[6449.70 → 6449.94] hey,
[6450.00 → 6450.74] we're publishing
[6450.74 → 6452.60] a list of the top
[6452.60 → 6454.32] 10 tech influencers
[6454.32 → 6455.34] or,
[6455.56 → 6455.84] you know,
[6455.86 → 6457.38] the top most influential people
[6457.38 → 6457.68] in,
[6457.74 → 6459.24] in technology and media
[6459.24 → 6459.72] or,
[6459.72 → 6460.48] uh,
[6460.48 → 6461.70] social media or whatever.
[6462.04 → 6462.48] Um,
[6462.50 → 6463.08] do you,
[6463.32 → 6463.54] uh,
[6463.54 → 6464.86] we'd love to include you.
[6464.86 → 6466.04] That'll be $500
[6466.04 → 6467.18] or whatever.
[6467.64 → 6468.12] So,
[6468.36 → 6469.08] uh,
[6469.08 → 6472.08] I actually strongly believe
[6472.08 → 6474.76] that with a little bit of effort,
[6474.76 → 6477.90] you are very influential.
[6478.14 → 6478.48] With a little bit,
[6478.52 → 6479.18] you're saying I could,
[6479.24 → 6479.40] I could,
[6479.46 → 6480.68] very broadly known.
[6480.82 → 6481.54] By influence?
[6481.54 → 6482.70] I think we just,
[6482.84 → 6484.62] I think we just need to play the game.
[6485.46 → 6487.10] I just think we need to play the game
[6487.10 → 6487.56] a little bit.
[6487.56 → 6487.72] You know,
[6487.78 → 6489.22] if it's third party sources
[6489.22 → 6489.86] that they need,
[6489.92 → 6490.84] which is what I'm seeing here,
[6491.10 → 6492.44] the only thing that I think
[6492.44 → 6493.30] they need to include
[6493.30 → 6494.66] is the handling of the
[6494.66 → 6495.92] the hard event.
[6496.94 → 6498.06] And then you'll have
[6498.06 → 6499.38] infinite third party sources.
[6499.38 → 6499.62] Yeah.
[6499.74 → 6500.04] Well,
[6500.10 → 6500.34] I mean,
[6500.34 → 6501.08] you don't want your entire
[6501.08 → 6502.84] Wikipedia article to just be like,
[6503.04 → 6504.96] he saved Linus's company.
[6505.54 → 6505.66] Yeah,
[6505.74 → 6506.18] but that's what,
[6506.18 → 6509.14] that's what gets it through the door.
[6509.32 → 6511.02] And then you can add the fun stuff.
[6511.80 → 6512.78] What is it like?
[6513.64 → 6514.46] Early life,
[6514.76 → 6515.52] rise to fame,
[6515.80 → 6516.38] strife.
[6517.48 → 6517.92] Downfall.
[6519.14 → 6520.46] Notable controversies.
[6520.60 → 6520.96] Yeah.
[6523.80 → 6524.16] Yeah.
[6524.48 → 6524.88] Controversy.
[6525.00 → 6525.18] And then,
[6525.18 → 6526.18] and then array.
[6526.28 → 6526.40] One,
[6526.44 → 6526.52] two,
[6526.54 → 6526.64] three,
[6526.66 → 6526.76] four,
[6526.80 → 6526.90] five,
[6526.94 → 6527.04] six.
[6529.38 → 6530.00] I don't know.
[6530.12 → 6532.20] I think that with a little bit of effort
[6532.20 → 6533.80] and I'm going to throw this,
[6533.92 → 6534.80] I'm going to throw this back
[6534.80 → 6536.08] to the community a little bit.
[6536.36 → 6536.82] Oh no.
[6536.82 → 6537.52] We could maybe,
[6537.92 → 6538.26] you know,
[6538.42 → 6541.90] we could maybe fraud some publications
[6541.90 → 6542.76] or maybe,
[6542.94 → 6543.82] maybe just,
[6544.04 → 6544.72] you know,
[6544.92 → 6545.10] get,
[6545.18 → 6546.42] get some invitations,
[6546.42 → 6549.00] get some invitations for interviews.
[6549.10 → 6549.18] No,
[6549.24 → 6549.32] no,
[6549.36 → 6552.02] like being interviewed by people is important.
[6552.26 → 6552.58] Okay.
[6552.66 → 6552.94] Like,
[6553.00 → 6553.40] um,
[6553.78 → 6554.28] um,
[6554.28 → 6555.12] I'm trying to remember
[6555.12 → 6555.66] because I,
[6555.80 → 6556.00] I,
[6556.16 → 6556.84] my initial,
[6557.16 → 6557.70] a couple of those,
[6557.80 → 6559.34] the community tried to get me,
[6559.38 → 6560.56] on there a number of times
[6560.56 → 6562.30] before they ultimately succeeded.
[6562.62 → 6564.62] And I don't remember what the threshold was,
[6564.68 → 6565.34] but it was also,
[6565.44 → 6566.96] I was rejected for not being notable
[6566.96 → 6570.26] until such time as some arbiter
[6570.26 → 6571.72] of who's notable on Wikipedia
[6571.72 → 6573.04] decided I was notable.
[6573.32 → 6573.54] Right.
[6573.74 → 6574.12] I mean,
[6574.48 → 6575.34] here's something that,
[6575.42 → 6576.74] here's something that could potentially,
[6577.42 → 6577.98] um,
[6578.24 → 6579.70] that could potentially help.
[6579.70 → 6580.10] I do understand.
[6580.22 → 6582.06] Like if there's a Wikipedia page for everyone,
[6582.16 → 6583.42] then it just gets a little bit ridiculous.
[6583.64 → 6583.82] Yeah.
[6583.82 → 6584.10] That's,
[6584.16 → 6584.90] and that's fair enough.
[6585.18 → 6585.32] Yeah.
[6585.84 → 6586.28] Should we,
[6586.38 → 6587.52] should we talk about the thing?
[6587.72 → 6587.96] I don't,
[6588.04 → 6589.00] I'm not offended by this.
[6589.00 → 6589.58] Uh,
[6589.60 → 6590.00] talk about,
[6590.40 → 6590.78] uh,
[6590.88 → 6591.24] what?
[6592.04 → 6592.50] You know,
[6592.52 → 6592.92] the thing.
[6594.34 → 6594.70] Oh,
[6595.00 → 6595.60] uh,
[6595.78 → 6595.90] I,
[6596.18 → 6597.60] 30 minute warning.
[6597.90 → 6599.08] This might not be the show.
[6599.82 → 6600.52] I'm not even,
[6600.58 → 6600.92] I just,
[6601.00 → 6602.10] I think it's maybe not,
[6602.16 → 6604.24] I think we do it the one after next week.
[6604.36 → 6604.40] Maybe.
[6604.68 → 6605.70] Dr. Gizmo says the thing.
[6605.82 → 6607.38] So that we have more time.
[6607.46 → 6608.50] Luca 103 says,
[6608.66 → 6608.92] yes.
[6609.08 → 6610.48] We haven't done after dark.
[6610.56 → 6611.18] Crystal says,
[6611.18 → 6611.60] there are 30 minutes left.
[6611.60 → 6612.40] Crystal says thing?
[6612.40 → 6616.74] I'm just saying.
[6616.78 → 6617.82] I think there's no time.
[6618.08 → 6619.70] I think we do it the week after next week.
[6619.88 → 6620.24] I'm not even,
[6620.34 → 6620.60] I don't even,
[6620.64 → 6621.04] I don't think I'm,
[6622.62 → 6623.82] but we have to do after,
[6623.92 → 6624.72] there's merch messages.
[6624.72 → 6625.90] I'm sure we have to do after dark.
[6627.46 → 6628.98] And I suspect that might end up,
[6629.14 → 6632.30] I suspect that'll either be a very short or very long conversation.
[6632.30 → 6633.12] Have people even,
[6633.38 → 6635.68] have we even told people how to send merch messages yet?
[6635.98 → 6636.30] No.
[6636.70 → 6637.50] Holy crap.
[6637.50 → 6638.40] This is what I'm talking about.
[6638.92 → 6640.04] We don't have time,
[6640.14 → 6640.32] brother.
[6640.66 → 6642.06] Did I finish the rest of the sponsors?
[6643.16 → 6644.02] Good Lord.
[6644.10 → 6645.10] We do not have time.
[6645.40 → 6646.30] This is not the show.
[6646.70 → 6647.08] Um,
[6647.56 → 6647.92] hey,
[6648.04 → 6651.74] it's that time of year to buy something on LTT store.com.
[6652.22 → 6652.50] Uh,
[6652.50 → 6653.64] you could pick up,
[6653.64 → 6653.96] uh,
[6653.96 → 6656.92] some of the new deals that we have right now.
[6657.22 → 6658.14] Buy a commuter bag today,
[6658.20 → 6659.16] get $50 to spend,
[6659.20 → 6659.50] or hey,
[6659.70 → 6660.74] we've got a limited,
[6660.88 → 6661.06] very,
[6661.06 → 6661.42] very,
[6661.54 → 6663.54] very limited number of black shaft screwdrivers.
[6663.70 → 6665.70] So you could go ahead and add a commuter bag,
[6666.12 → 6666.54] add to cart.
[6666.54 → 6667.54] Boom.
[6667.94 → 6669.60] Head to the cart and you'll see,
[6669.76 → 6670.00] ah,
[6670.02 → 6670.22] yes,
[6670.28 → 6671.40] the interface to send a merch message.
[6671.46 → 6672.26] It will go to producer Dan,
[6673.30 → 6674.22] who will,
[6674.58 → 6675.04] um,
[6675.52 → 6676.84] probably this week,
[6676.98 → 6680.34] mostly not curate too many of them because I do have a hard out in a little bit.
[6680.92 → 6681.28] And,
[6681.42 → 6681.74] uh,
[6681.78 → 6682.28] I mean,
[6682.30 → 6684.42] or you guys could hang and do some merch messages after I leave.
[6684.44 → 6684.88] Either way,
[6685.18 → 6685.40] uh,
[6685.40 → 6690.24] he will also maybe like respond to you or forward it to someone who can help with your message.
[6690.24 → 6692.50] You place your order and then instead of just throwing money at your screen,
[6692.62 → 6695.02] you can throw money at amazing merchandise,
[6695.02 → 6696.72] like our quality commuter bag or,
[6696.72 → 6697.58] uh,
[6697.64 → 6698.40] or a cool hoodie,
[6698.46 → 6700.60] like the one that I'm wearing or a cool shirt.
[6700.74 → 6700.92] Oh,
[6701.04 → 6702.04] Luke's wearing the glitch shirt.
[6703.76 → 6705.46] So you could go into your cart, and you could be like,
[6705.52 → 6705.72] glitch,
[6705.80 → 6706.12] please.
[6706.52 → 6708.80] And then you'd get a glitch shirt.
[6709.24 → 6710.28] That would be quality.
[6710.40 → 6710.58] Dan,
[6710.58 → 6713.84] why don't we do one merch message to show people how merch messages work?
[6714.18 → 6714.46] Sure.
[6714.64 → 6714.80] Hey,
[6714.84 → 6715.02] DL,
[6715.14 → 6716.48] when considering the tech house,
[6716.58 → 6720.44] were you afraid that having the easiest house would affect your ability to make entertaining
[6720.44 → 6724.22] and more quote unquote universal upgrade videos for others to watch?
[6724.54 → 6724.96] No,
[6725.18 → 6726.06] because,
[6726.14 → 6726.78] um,
[6727.60 → 6728.26] there will be,
[6728.44 → 6729.20] in my mind,
[6729.20 → 6732.46] the tech house is just the beginning.
[6733.90 → 6734.42] Nice.
[6734.42 → 6735.54] In my mind,
[6735.94 → 6736.44] we,
[6736.78 → 6737.04] we,
[6737.04 → 6737.54] we,
[6737.54 → 6737.82] we,
[6737.92 → 6739.12] no,
[6739.76 → 6740.82] in my mind,
[6740.90 → 6741.16] tech,
[6741.40 → 6742.82] small city.
[6743.00 → 6743.76] Hmm.
[6744.82 → 6745.42] Interesting.
[6745.80 → 6746.68] RV park.
[6746.84 → 6747.14] Oh,
[6747.80 → 6748.24] in my,
[6748.24 → 6748.94] campsite.
[6748.94 → 6751.64] In my mind,
[6751.64 → 6754.06] this is just the first one.
[6755.40 → 6756.72] So we want,
[6756.80 → 6757.62] I wanted to,
[6758.10 → 6760.18] it's just like I said at the beginning of the video,
[6760.18 → 6769.34] I wanted to have something that is somewhat relatable that people could follow along at home a bit where we have to solve real world problems.
[6769.54 → 6770.06] You know,
[6770.12 → 6770.66] we're going to have to be,
[6770.78 → 6772.00] we're going to fish wire up through,
[6772.14 → 6772.82] through walls.
[6772.92 → 6773.20] We're going to,
[6773.28 → 6774.50] we're going to solve real problems,
[6774.50 → 6776.94] whether we do it intentionally or unintentionally.
[6777.02 → 6778.10] Cause like we might,
[6778.10 → 6779.68] I'm honestly really excited for this.
[6779.74 → 6783.24] We might pull a bunch of the drywall off to make it easier to run a lot of the wiring.
[6783.50 → 6785.06] And then we might realize that,
[6785.30 → 6785.50] oops,
[6785.58 → 6787.72] we got to run another one, and we're going to have to figure that out.
[6787.76 → 6788.12] We're going to,
[6788.22 → 6789.34] what if you find a mould?
[6789.78 → 6791.02] Then we're going to have to solve that.
[6791.08 → 6791.78] Oh my.
[6791.86 → 6792.36] So we're going to,
[6792.48 → 6793.98] it's going to be challenging.
[6794.14 → 6794.84] I'm not worried.
[6794.92 → 6796.28] It's not going to be challenging enough,
[6796.28 → 6805.32] but I did want one where I kind of had a pretty good vision of like what it kind of might look like and how we might tackle these challenges.
[6805.32 → 6807.24] If this goes well,
[6807.24 → 6808.52] if it's a huge success,
[6808.52 → 6814.88] then I could totally see us doing something very similar with a condo,
[6815.26 → 6817.96] something very similar with a more challenging house,
[6818.02 → 6818.22] you know,
[6818.24 → 6818.58] with a
[6818.58 → 6823.62] with a rancher that's right on a slab where we have to like really dig deep and find solutions.
[6824.00 → 6824.44] No,
[6824.52 → 6824.68] I'm,
[6824.72 → 6826.04] I'm super excited about it.
[6826.04 → 6829.30] And I think it's going to be flipping awesome pun intended.
[6829.30 → 6836.30] Um,
[6837.42 → 6839.58] Oh,
[6839.82 → 6840.18] sorry.
[6840.22 → 6840.92] What am I supposed to be doing?
[6841.26 → 6841.80] Oh yeah.
[6841.82 → 6841.98] Right.
[6842.02 → 6844.06] The show is brought to you by Sale for many folks.
[6844.16 → 6845.82] The holiday season comes with a lot of travel,
[6845.90 → 6850.38] often to other countries and phone companies just love to hit you with fees when you travel.
[6850.46 → 6850.86] Well,
[6850.88 → 6851.62] thanks to our sponsor,

[6860.28 → 6863.12] They have plans in several countries that are starting at just a few bucks,
[6863.24 → 6866.02] which is way cheaper than getting hit for even one day of roaming.
[6866.56 → 6867.88] Don't worry about going over your date,
[6868.00 → 6869.02] over your data limit though,

[6891.38 → 6891.78] Finally,
[6891.86 → 6892.76] the show is brought to you by Messi.
[6893.06 → 6893.54] Last week,
[6893.58 → 6895.92] we had quite the downpour here in the Vancouver area,
[6896.06 → 6897.58] which is common this time of year,
[6897.90 → 6899.34] but it was worse than usual.
[6899.88 → 6905.50] The point is quite a few people were doing holiday shopping with squelching socks,
[6905.60 → 6905.94] I think.
[6905.94 → 6908.10] And if you don't want to be a wet sock Wendell,
[6908.60 → 6909.76] then check out our sponsor,
[6910.18 → 6910.52] Messi.
[6910.94 → 6911.54] As always,
[6911.54 → 6914.76] Messi claims that their shoes are a hundred percent waterproof.
[6915.26 → 6918.34] And if you're looking for a gift for the favourite puddle jumper in your life,
[6918.38 → 6920.26] you can check out their Storm burst collection.
[6920.72 → 6925.32] They have removable soles for all day comfort and a rugged grip that's perfect for winter
[6925.32 → 6926.04] walks.
[6926.04 → 6929.68] And you can snag a pair of Messi's high quality gloves to go with them.
[6930.02 → 6930.92] As an added bonus,
[6931.02 → 6931.90] the first five people,
[6932.10 → 6932.94] the first five.
[6933.06 → 6933.22] Oh,
[6933.28 → 6933.42] wow.
[6933.48 → 6934.16] That's really not a lot.
[6934.46 → 6939.38] The first five people to use the following code will get up to $250 to redeem at checkout.
[6939.54 → 6939.96] Are you ready?
[6940.08 → 6940.62] Here it comes.
[6942.34 → 6942.74] Uh,
[6942.88 → 6943.40] okay.
[6944.38 → 6944.82] VIP.
[6944.82 → 6947.70] everyone hates squelching socks.
[6947.70 → 6948.86] So save some money.
[6949.40 → 6950.70] Hope everybody got that.
[6950.92 → 6951.62] Good luck.
[6951.96 → 6952.44] Way to go,
[6952.52 → 6952.78] Messi.
[6952.80 → 6954.36] You're distracting people from watching our show.
[6955.32 → 6955.94] That's fine.
[6955.98 → 6957.46] They probably had it on the second screen anyway.
[6959.16 → 6960.16] All right.
[6960.22 → 6961.52] What do we want to talk about next?
[6962.52 → 6962.88] Uh,
[6962.92 → 6966.46] we are really getting into not a lot of after dark territory,
[6966.46 → 6967.10] but,
[6967.30 → 6968.10] um,
[6969.14 → 6972.04] a school security AI flagged a clarinet as a gun.
[6972.48 → 6975.18] And apparently it was supposed to do that.
[6975.58 → 6980.06] A Florida middle school went into lockdown after an AI security system flagged a student's
[6980.06 → 6980.82] clarinet as a gun,
[6980.90 → 6985.08] sending police rushing to the campus for what they believed was an active shooter situation.
[6985.60 → 6989.24] Officers later confirmed there was no threat and the weapon was a band instrument carried
[6989.24 → 6990.96] by a student in a holiday costume.
[6991.52 → 6996.78] The AI system made by zero eyes scans security camera footage for firearms and alert school
[6996.78 → 6997.64] officials and police.
[6998.18 → 6999.22] Despite the false alarm,
[6999.30 → 7001.04] the company said the system worked as intended,
[7001.42 → 7005.20] arguing that it is better to act on uncertainty than to risk missing a real threat,
[7005.64 → 7007.34] a position the school appeared to support.
[7008.00 → 7011.44] Critics say that incidents like this highlight the risks of AI based school security,
[7011.70 → 7016.34] pointing to past cases where similar systems have mistaken harmless objects for guns and
[7016.34 → 7017.00] caused panic.
[7017.14 → 7018.86] They argue the tools are expensive,
[7018.86 → 7023.78] unproven and may increase stress and police confrontations rather than improve student
[7023.78 → 7024.12] safety.
[7024.12 → 7029.96] Sending a bunch of extremely high stress people with firearms into a situation where they think
[7029.96 → 7033.88] kids are being shot at because of a mistake.
[7034.54 → 7034.92] Well,
[7034.96 → 7036.92] I support this because I just plain hate the clarinet.
[7038.40 → 7038.90] I'm just,
[7038.98 → 7039.30] I'm kidding.
[7040.16 → 7041.08] It was just a joke,
[7041.16 → 7042.02] but we need to move on anyway.
[7042.28 → 7043.22] Hopefully it was,
[7043.22 → 7043.60] uh,
[7043.60 → 7045.24] called off before they got there.
[7045.76 → 7046.12] Um,
[7048.22 → 7048.48] yeah,
[7048.74 → 7049.14] anyway,
[7049.68 → 7050.08] uh,
[7050.14 → 7051.64] a former Amazon.
[7051.82 → 7051.92] Oh,
[7051.96 → 7052.26] you know what?
[7052.26 → 7053.52] Let's do this one next week too.
[7054.36 → 7054.72] Okay.
[7054.90 → 7055.06] Yeah.
[7055.14 → 7055.32] I mean,
[7055.32 → 7056.78] there are a lot of topics.
[7056.90 → 7057.00] Yeah.
[7057.00 → 7060.18] I don't know what happened because I thought you messaged saying there was like none.
[7060.36 → 7060.66] I did.
[7060.74 → 7062.44] And I don't recognize a lot of these.
[7062.56 → 7064.22] They weren't every single week.
[7064.38 → 7065.94] I do not say that every week.
[7066.00 → 7067.08] I just say it many weeks.
[7067.50 → 7068.00] Every week.
[7068.14 → 7068.34] Yeah.
[7068.46 → 7069.18] Not true.
[7069.30 → 7069.44] Oh,
[7069.48 → 7070.28] there are no topics.
[7070.38 → 7071.78] I have not seen this Facebook one.
[7072.30 → 7078.48] Facebook has apparently tested limiting users to a maximum of two shared links per month
[7078.48 → 7080.76] unless they pay for meta verified.
[7082.02 → 7082.50] Uh,
[7083.38 → 7085.88] links in only two organic posts per month.
[7085.88 → 7086.76] If they're not verified,
[7087.00 → 7091.70] users who hit the two link limit are prompted to subscribe to meta verified.
[7091.70 → 7094.24] If they wish to share additional external links,
[7094.36 → 7098.14] they are in the business of getting scammers to pay the money.
[7098.26 → 7099.68] We talked about this earlier in the show.
[7100.28 → 7101.38] Maybe it's just more of that.
[7102.38 → 7106.00] The trial currently focuses on a subset of independent creators and pages that are using
[7106.00 → 7106.96] professional mode.
[7107.52 → 7107.90] Notably,
[7108.06 → 7111.80] traditional news publishers are excluded from this specific test for the time being.
[7112.18 → 7113.90] Though it is worth noting that in many countries,
[7114.24 → 7114.64] um,
[7114.86 → 7118.62] they can't share news on Facebook due to attribution and compensation laws that meta doesn't want
[7118.62 → 7119.70] to deal with anyway.
[7120.08 → 7120.38] Okay,
[7120.46 → 7120.62] cool.
[7120.68 → 7121.76] That was all I had to say about that.
[7121.88 → 7123.44] Facebook sucks.
[7124.48 → 7124.82] Cool.
[7126.88 → 7127.36] Um,
[7127.58 → 7129.16] let's move this one to next week.
[7129.16 → 7130.28] I'm just going to highlight it.
[7130.94 → 7131.78] Droopily doop.
[7132.14 → 7132.66] Next week.
[7132.76 → 7133.64] This is weird.
[7134.38 → 7134.62] Sure.
[7134.72 → 7135.16] Go for it.
[7135.54 → 7136.06] Uh,
[7136.50 → 7139.38] YouTube is letting creators make playable games with the Gemini 3 tool.
[7139.78 → 7142.28] YouTube is testing a new feature that lets creators build.
[7142.68 → 7143.24] Yeah.
[7143.68 → 7144.28] Uh,
[7144.46 → 7144.74] the
[7144.80 → 7149.76] the project called Playable Builder is launching as an open beta for select creators.
[7149.76 → 7155.72] The tool works through a web app that lets creators describe a game in plain language
[7155.72 → 7157.80] with no coding required.
[7158.24 → 7163.04] YouTube has already been experimenting with small games on its platform since 2023 and added
[7163.04 → 7164.50] multiplayer support last year.
[7164.64 → 7169.20] So this is an expansion of that idea with AI doing most of the setup work.
[7170.20 → 7175.70] YouTube says that the goal is to make quick bite sized games that viewers can play inside
[7175.70 → 7176.78] YouTube.
[7178.06 → 7178.50] Why?
[7178.68 → 7179.16] On,
[7179.16 → 7179.22] on,
[7179.22 → 7180.48] on desktop or mobile,
[7180.76 → 7181.94] not full scale releases.
[7182.34 → 7182.92] Think simple,
[7183.08 → 7183.26] inter,
[7183.50 → 7187.48] interactive experiences rather than polished story driven titles or console style games.
[7188.52 → 7191.26] Critics point out that while AI can help generate basic game mechanics,
[7191.30 → 7195.58] making a game that's actually fun usually takes iteration design skill and human judgment
[7195.58 → 7198.70] because AI can create a game doesn't mean people want to play it.
[7198.70 → 7199.14] Okay.
[7200.76 → 7201.36] Okay.
[7202.78 → 7203.34] Okay.
[7204.22 → 7206.72] So it's like terrible frog game.
[7208.28 → 7209.12] I guess.
[7210.22 → 7211.00] But you're blue now.
[7211.42 → 7211.80] Nice.
[7215.46 → 7217.12] So it's gaming slop.
[7217.56 → 7218.98] You are running in dirt.
[7219.18 → 7221.14] So the name of the game seems.
[7221.76 → 7221.92] Oh,
[7222.02 → 7222.48] that was it.
[7222.56 → 7224.60] I can't tell what are obstacles and what are.
[7224.74 → 7225.26] You died.
[7226.84 → 7227.40] Yeah.
[7227.40 → 7228.94] Um,
[7229.14 → 7230.76] okay.
[7231.84 → 7232.32] Well,
[7232.44 → 7233.66] that was something.
[7235.06 → 7235.62] Uh,
[7236.04 → 7237.62] cool.
[7237.96 → 7238.40] I,
[7238.58 → 7239.08] um,
[7239.40 → 7240.88] I guess for me,
[7240.88 → 7245.00] the big question is why?
[7246.12 → 7246.64] Yeah,
[7246.68 → 7247.92] that's for sure.
[7248.16 → 7249.90] That's my same question as well.
[7250.58 → 7251.66] Netflix tried games.
[7251.80 → 7253.20] I don't think that worked out.
[7253.98 → 7256.42] I don't feel like YouTube needs games.
[7256.42 → 7257.92] Study zone.
[7258.16 → 7261.96] My new task is to finish the WAN show.
[7262.08 → 7262.96] Like what am I,
[7263.98 → 7265.08] do I check it off?
[7265.76 → 7266.68] Achievement unlocked.
[7266.80 → 7267.56] First steps.
[7268.04 → 7274.88] My like biggest concern about YouTube right now is that they seem to be pushing towards shorts quite a bit.
[7274.88 → 7276.06] And God,
[7276.12 → 7276.70] it's so much.
[7276.70 → 7278.12] It's getting so bad.
[7278.14 → 7284.30] Shorts are literally called by a lot of people like slop or brain rot or something else like that.
[7284.30 → 7289.14] And YouTube was always known as a like wholesome community platform.
[7290.04 → 7290.46] That is like.
[7290.52 → 7291.24] Wholesome is questionable,
[7291.40 → 7292.16] but definitely community.
[7292.16 → 7292.32] No,
[7292.38 → 7293.24] in a lot of ways,
[7293.32 → 7295.92] I think it's seen community and wholesome.
[7296.06 → 7297.60] I think of a lot of paired connotations.
[7297.76 → 7299.16] This is my homepage right now.
[7299.74 → 7300.70] An ad.
[7301.02 → 7302.48] It is more than half shorts.
[7303.22 → 7304.48] Two live streams.
[7305.92 → 7306.88] Five shorts.
[7306.88 → 7308.64] That's all that's above the fold.
[7308.66 → 7309.78] So zero Gods.
[7309.92 → 7311.82] I get three Gods.
[7312.00 → 7313.34] One of which is an ad.
[7314.36 → 7315.40] So that I can shop.
[7315.76 → 7318.38] I get this YouTube playable garbage.
[7318.50 → 7318.90] Stupid.
[7319.74 → 7321.78] Then I get another live stream.
[7322.10 → 7323.02] Finally a GOD.
[7323.20 → 7323.94] And oh my God,
[7323.96 → 7324.72] I got Rick rolled.
[7325.20 → 7327.04] That is the first two.
[7327.04 → 7327.26] No,
[7327.32 → 7327.42] no,
[7327.42 → 7327.54] no,
[7327.54 → 7327.66] no.
[7327.74 → 7328.50] That's a mix.
[7329.02 → 7330.46] These keep coming up as well.
[7330.60 → 7331.42] More shorts.
[7331.70 → 7332.36] It's a mix.
[7332.52 → 7333.10] It's different.
[7333.32 → 7333.84] More ad.
[7333.84 → 7336.66] The Rick roll is like something different.
[7336.84 → 7337.88] It's not like a video.
[7338.02 → 7338.92] Full width ad.
[7340.74 → 7342.14] Like these sucks.
[7343.12 → 7343.96] And I'm,
[7343.96 → 7349.30] I'm worried that YouTube is going down a not good path in regard to.
[7349.56 → 7350.50] I've raised this.
[7350.58 → 7350.96] It's,
[7351.04 → 7352.98] it's like future legitimacy.
[7353.28 → 7353.60] I've,
[7353.60 → 7354.34] I've raised this.
[7354.48 → 7354.82] I've,
[7354.82 → 7355.14] I've,
[7355.14 → 7360.78] the ability for outside companies to encroach on its part of the internet.
[7361.20 → 7361.52] I,
[7361.58 → 7361.94] I,
[7362.10 → 7362.64] I,
[7362.78 → 7363.82] I can't,
[7363.84 → 7366.88] raise this any more often than I already raise it.
[7367.12 → 7369.90] You're dumping mud into your own moat.
[7370.94 → 7371.46] Like.
[7373.82 → 7377.80] How about just let someone else be the brain rot platform.
[7377.98 → 7378.34] And you can,
[7378.38 → 7378.44] you,
[7378.52 → 7380.20] I think you can have shorts on it.
[7380.62 → 7382.66] I don't think shorts existing on YouTube is the problem.
[7382.74 → 7384.66] I think it's the promotion level of them.
[7385.18 → 7387.94] Make it trying to make it the primary part of YouTube.
[7387.94 → 7389.72] I think is actually a very,
[7390.04 → 7391.02] very bad idea.
[7391.02 → 7392.14] Um,
[7392.14 → 7395.64] yeah.
[7397.14 → 7399.34] To the point where if you really want to do that,
[7399.34 → 7401.90] I almost think it should be a separate app.
[7404.72 → 7405.04] Anyway,
[7405.30 → 7405.68] um,
[7405.68 → 7406.60] I'm trying to do too much.
[7406.68 → 7407.94] I'm trying to be a gaming platform.
[7408.08 → 7409.68] You're trying to be V shorts platform.
[7409.80 → 7411.16] Trying to be a live-streaming platform.
[7411.28 → 7412.50] Trying to be a valid platform.
[7412.58 → 7415.80] Trying to be a posts comment thing platform.
[7415.80 → 7418.26] Trying to be a TV.
[7418.68 → 7420.98] And what I mean by that is like old school TV.
[7421.56 → 7422.00] Um,
[7422.00 → 7424.06] not the fact that it's on a TV to be clear.
[7424.62 → 7425.10] Um,
[7425.42 → 7426.48] it's,
[7426.68 → 7428.06] it's rough.
[7428.18 → 7431.60] I have within the last like year,
[7431.60 → 7437.34] I think I've never heard so much negative sentiment about what YouTube is.
[7437.48 → 7437.88] Yeah.
[7438.74 → 7440.02] And what I mean by that is again,
[7440.12 → 7442.28] attaching to words like brain rot,
[7442.40 → 7443.02] AI slop,
[7443.20 → 7443.90] things like that.
[7444.02 → 7445.74] I've never heard that type of stuff.
[7445.86 → 7446.08] Generally,
[7446.08 → 7450.96] people are very positive about what YouTube is and might be very negative about things that are on it.
[7451.08 → 7452.62] Or how aggressively they monetize it.
[7452.78 → 7452.92] Sure.
[7453.06 → 7453.94] Something like that.
[7454.00 → 7455.64] But YouTube at its core,
[7455.76 → 7457.20] everyone was always very positive about.
[7457.38 → 7457.48] Yeah.
[7457.54 → 7458.80] And then that is now changing.
[7458.90 → 7459.52] And that's a
[7460.04 → 7461.56] and they resisted the urge,
[7461.72 → 7461.88] you know,
[7461.92 → 7463.22] back when Vine was a thing,
[7463.74 → 7467.26] YouTube resisted the urge to just be Vine.
[7468.20 → 7469.30] Or be Snapchat.
[7469.72 → 7470.36] Or be,
[7470.52 → 7470.72] you know,
[7470.78 → 7471.66] whatever more,
[7471.66 → 7472.34] um,
[7473.58 → 7476.66] digestible rapid fire content was.
[7476.98 → 7477.26] You know,
[7477.28 → 7478.90] they didn't have to add,
[7479.00 → 7479.48] you know,
[7479.56 → 7480.02] DMing.
[7480.38 → 7480.74] Uh,
[7480.74 → 7482.10] they didn't have to add,
[7482.18 → 7482.54] you know,
[7482.70 → 7486.14] short form vertical videos that you can swipe through.
[7486.30 → 7486.76] They,
[7486.92 → 7489.26] they really didn't have to add this game thing.
[7489.26 → 7491.10] They really didn't have a lot of,
[7491.10 → 7493.22] of extreme addiction,
[7493.22 → 7495.76] actually terrible for you think.
[7495.76 → 7496.12] Yes.
[7496.12 → 7497.88] People would spend way too much time on YouTube,
[7498.02 → 7498.26] whatever.
[7498.52 → 7498.74] And yes,
[7498.74 → 7501.46] that was their business model and still is for sure.
[7501.76 → 7507.24] But there are rather extreme levels of manipulation when it comes to short form content,
[7507.24 → 7511.38] which is like actually bad for your brain and like extremely hijacking,
[7511.54 → 7512.30] dopaminergic,
[7512.50 → 7512.64] blah,
[7512.66 → 7512.76] blah,
[7512.76 → 7512.88] blah,
[7512.88 → 7513.00] blah,
[7513.00 → 7514.16] things that I don't understand.
[7514.26 → 7515.42] Go watch someone else talk about it.
[7515.60 → 7516.68] I don't know anything about medical stuff.
[7516.90 → 7517.62] Please don't hate me.
[7517.88 → 7518.30] Um,
[7518.36 → 7518.74] it's,
[7518.80 → 7519.04] it's,
[7519.10 → 7519.20] yeah,
[7519.20 → 7519.54] there you go.
[7519.54 → 7520.26] Um,
[7520.42 → 7520.92] but it's,
[7520.92 → 7521.18] it's,
[7521.22 → 7521.42] it's,
[7521.48 → 7521.82] they're not,
[7521.90 → 7523.14] they're not like good for us.
[7523.42 → 7526.62] Shorts are highly questionable as a thing.
[7526.74 → 7528.86] And algorithmic tuning too was,
[7529.04 → 7531.74] was something that I feel like they were more thoughtful about in the past.
[7531.74 → 7532.14] Yes.
[7532.36 → 7534.82] I remember having a long conversation with them back when,
[7534.86 → 7538.42] you remember that trend when it was just red-hot knives cutting through things was like
[7538.42 → 7539.70] half of the stupid videos.
[7539.90 → 7541.26] And the other half were like,
[7541.26 → 7541.64] how many,
[7541.64 → 7543.62] how many M&Ms can you flush down a toilet?
[7543.62 → 7545.36] And I was basically like,
[7545.46 → 7546.32] I talked to them, and I was like,
[7546.44 → 7546.70] look,
[7547.44 → 7550.94] I'm not just sitting here whining and moaning because you know,
[7551.22 → 7555.20] my more technical actually requires a little bit of cognitive load.
[7555.54 → 7557.88] Content is like getting fewer views right now.
[7558.58 → 7560.46] Obviously that's a concern for me.
[7560.54 → 7562.38] I do wish to be promoted,
[7562.62 → 7563.38] uh,
[7563.42 → 7563.64] you know,
[7563.66 → 7564.56] on the platform.
[7564.56 → 7565.04] Right.
[7565.16 → 7569.92] But if your bar is going to be that anything that doesn't get the click through,
[7570.24 → 7571.70] if you are this platform now,
[7571.90 → 7573.04] gummy bears in a toilet,
[7573.04 → 7573.86] or,
[7573.86 → 7576.82] or red-hot knives cutting through watermelons or,
[7576.82 → 7579.86] or pieces of feces or,
[7580.00 → 7580.10] you know,
[7580.14 → 7580.46] whatever,
[7580.64 → 7581.38] whatever it is,
[7581.38 → 7583.88] if I can't achieve that level of click through,
[7584.04 → 7585.02] then I just like,
[7585.06 → 7586.90] don't get my videos served.
[7587.12 → 7591.36] Is that going to be good for your platform in the longer term?
[7591.54 → 7596.14] Is that going to be good for the creator ecosystem that you're trying to build,
[7596.14 → 7598.30] where people can have predictable,
[7598.72 → 7601.88] stable performance that allows them to hire people and build businesses?
[7601.88 → 7603.86] Is that what you want?
[7604.34 → 7607.78] And I feel like they've lost track of that.
[7608.00 → 7611.52] YouTube felt like it was being built for the forever.
[7612.18 → 7613.70] And right now,
[7613.70 → 7615.30] again,
[7615.30 → 7617.58] over the very relatively short period of time,
[7617.64 → 7618.30] maybe a year,
[7618.58 → 7619.20] somewhere around that,
[7619.42 → 7620.92] it really feels like they are,
[7620.92 → 7621.46] it's been rough,
[7621.62 → 7624.40] diving extremely hard for the short term,
[7624.40 → 7627.66] which is not a game they even need to win.
[7627.86 → 7634.00] They were effectively a hundred percent of the market share of the forever video platform.
[7635.70 → 7636.50] Win that.
[7636.64 → 7639.28] You already had every eyeball of everyone on the planet,
[7639.40 → 7639.78] basically.
[7640.00 → 7640.52] You know how they,
[7640.56 → 7644.40] they stopped reporting like user change because it was effectively population change.
[7644.40 → 7644.84] Yeah.
[7645.10 → 7645.36] Like,
[7645.52 → 7645.82] dude,
[7646.32 → 7647.18] you won.
[7651.36 → 7654.58] Please don't grasp defeat from the jaws of victory.
[7654.78 → 7656.14] It's not necessary.
[7656.46 → 7657.76] And you can still not do it.
[7657.86 → 7658.58] In other news,
[7658.82 → 7660.62] the ChatGPT app store is here.
[7660.62 → 7665.58] Open AI has opened up app submissions for ChatGPT,
[7665.68 → 7670.42] letting developers publish apps that run directly inside the chatbot and appear in a new app directory.
[7670.90 → 7674.40] These apps can extend conversations by taking actions like ordering groceries,
[7674.94 → 7675.96] building slide decks,
[7676.02 → 7678.86] or searching for apartments without leaving ChatGPT.
[7679.72 → 7679.96] Oh,
[7680.06 → 7680.30] good.
[7680.84 → 7686.24] Developers can build apps using the apps SDK in beta and submit them through the open AI developer platform.
[7686.66 → 7690.50] Approved apps will begin rolling up next year and can be discovered through ChatGPT's tools menu,
[7690.62 → 7693.00] or triggered directly in conversations.
[7693.60 → 7694.06] For now,
[7694.22 → 7697.22] monetization is limited to linking out to external websites or apps,
[7697.38 → 7700.88] while open AI says that it's exploring future options like digital goods.
[7701.72 → 7703.72] All apps must follow safety and privacy rules.
[7703.80 → 7704.58] That shouldn't be too hard.
[7704.58 → 7708.52] With clear data disclosures and easy ways for users to disconnect.
[7709.14 → 7709.46] Canva,
[7709.66 → 7710.12] Expedia,
[7710.26 → 7710.60] Spotify,
[7710.84 → 7713.46] and TripAdvisor are already available with app integration,
[7713.86 → 7719.50] although the new store is being launched with an open call for developers to put new apps on the platform.
[7720.62 → 7724.60] Cool.
[7724.86 → 7725.18] Um,
[7725.26 → 7727.02] I really just don't want to talk about that.
[7727.10 → 7728.24] So why don't we do some rich messages?
[7728.44 → 7728.62] Yeah,
[7728.68 → 7729.18] sounds good.
[7732.50 → 7734.30] Magnetics says number one selling app girlfriend.
[7734.48 → 7734.80] No way.
[7735.26 → 7735.84] Is that true?
[7737.72 → 7738.10] No,
[7738.16 → 7738.76] it was a Mrs.
[7739.44 → 7740.44] Rappel honk.
[7740.44 → 7741.44] Uh,
[7742.52 → 7743.54] they're calling me a goose.
[7748.84 → 7749.48] This is,
[7749.54 → 7751.60] this is why I have to play on my phone the whole time.
[7751.66 → 7752.60] Otherwise it takes too long.
[7752.66 → 7752.86] Okay.
[7752.94 → 7753.08] Yeah,
[7753.08 → 7754.00] I got a couple here for you.
[7754.66 → 7755.54] Let's see.
[7756.00 → 7756.14] Hey,
[7756.20 → 7756.42] Dan,
[7756.54 → 7757.80] tell Linus and Luke,
[7757.90 → 7758.56] I say hi.
[7759.08 → 7759.36] Uh,
[7759.38 → 7760.44] Calder says hi.
[7760.74 → 7762.06] Technically you did that yourself.
[7762.06 → 7768.04] I recently programmed some automation dockers and without ChatGPT,
[7768.16 → 7769.46] it would have taken four times as long.
[7769.58 → 7771.62] Are there any better ways to learn to code?
[7771.70 → 7772.94] Am I stuck with ChatGPT?
[7773.56 → 7774.28] Luke's face.
[7778.92 → 7779.66] I can,
[7779.72 → 7782.30] I can feel the cringe from here.
[7782.30 → 7782.96] man.
[7784.16 → 7784.76] I mean,
[7784.92 → 7785.40] uh,
[7785.42 → 7785.80] man,
[7785.88 → 7790.10] I really enjoy this person's channel sometimes when they release videos,
[7790.20 → 7791.58] because I think there are big gaps between them,
[7791.72 → 7792.56] but I might be wrong.
[7792.64 → 7793.58] I might just not see them that often,
[7793.72 → 7793.86] but,
[7794.34 → 7794.92] um,
[7795.30 → 7796.46] basically homeless.
[7797.54 → 7798.86] We've talked about him on my show before.
[7798.88 → 7799.10] Oh yeah.
[7799.10 → 7801.56] I'm certain he had a video out recently that I,
[7801.58 → 7803.08] I thought was fantastic,
[7803.08 → 7803.98] which is this one.
[7804.32 → 7805.58] I tried switching to Linux for it.
[7805.58 → 7805.70] Yeah.
[7805.70 → 7806.78] There are some big gaps for new videos.
[7806.84 → 7807.00] Okay.
[7807.00 → 7807.52] I'm not crazy.
[7808.08 → 7808.48] Um,
[7808.68 → 7809.16] uh,
[7809.16 → 7809.38] the
[7809.48 → 7811.28] I tried switching to Linux for 157 days.
[7811.28 → 7813.40] Very interesting video,
[7813.40 → 7814.02] uh,
[7814.02 → 7814.82] fun ads.
[7814.94 → 7815.30] Uh,
[7815.30 → 7816.24] I'm used to YouTube premium.
[7816.34 → 7817.30] So whenever I see ads on YouTube,
[7817.30 → 7817.62] I'm like,
[7817.70 → 7817.98] what?
[7818.62 → 7819.54] That's not allowed.
[7819.70 → 7819.90] Yeah.
[7820.26 → 7820.70] Um,
[7820.74 → 7821.22] but yeah,
[7821.22 → 7821.64] great,
[7821.76 → 7822.74] great video in general.
[7822.84 → 7823.44] Go watch it.
[7823.54 → 7823.82] But,
[7823.94 → 7824.60] um,
[7825.72 → 7834.02] one of the topics that he brings up is that the accessibility of running Linux is actually kind of a lot higher.
[7834.46 → 7835.10] Thanks to,
[7835.22 → 7835.74] if you're like,
[7835.82 → 7835.92] Hey,
[7835.92 → 7836.76] I'm having this problem.
[7836.76 → 7837.20] And it's like,
[7837.24 → 7837.40] Oh,
[7837.44 → 7839.72] just copy and paste this into command line, and you're done.
[7839.72 → 7840.32] And it's like,
[7840.32 → 7840.68] Oh,
[7840.86 → 7841.34] cool.
[7841.64 → 7843.02] Command line is a lot less scary.
[7843.72 → 7844.16] And then I mean,
[7844.20 → 7845.64] there are questionable things about letting,
[7845.82 → 7846.22] you know,
[7846.48 → 7847.46] AI run your command line,
[7847.56 → 7849.92] but a command line is a lot less scary when you're just,
[7850.32 → 7855.94] you don't have to learn what every little part of the command means when you're just copying and pasting it.
[7856.38 → 7856.80] Um,
[7857.22 → 7857.58] it's a
[7857.62 → 7858.06] it's a very,
[7858.12 → 7858.86] it's very interesting video.
[7858.94 → 7859.42] Go check it out.
[7859.70 → 7860.14] Um,
[7860.14 → 7862.20] and in the same way,
[7862.30 → 7864.56] this makes it easier for you to do what you're doing,
[7864.56 → 7866.56] but it's questionable whether you were actually learning.
[7866.82 → 7868.26] Are you actually learning?
[7868.38 → 7869.36] Or actually learning coding?
[7869.66 → 7870.02] Yes.
[7870.66 → 7871.02] I,
[7871.28 → 7874.28] and if your goal isn't necessarily to actually learn it,
[7874.76 → 7875.08] okay.
[7875.24 → 7875.46] Yeah.
[7875.46 → 7878.62] You can also prompt things in a way where you make it like,
[7878.72 → 7879.00] you know,
[7879.00 → 7880.48] don't actually give me the answer.
[7880.86 → 7881.16] Yep.
[7881.16 → 7882.16] just like,
[7882.16 → 7882.58] like you,
[7882.64 → 7884.20] you can make it try to teach you,
[7884.36 → 7886.72] but it won't do that by default.
[7886.90 → 7887.14] No.
[7887.24 → 7891.44] And I think the vast majority of people are not using these things in that way.
[7891.50 → 7892.10] So like,
[7892.12 → 7893.20] if we're being realistic,
[7893.20 → 7894.34] um,
[7894.46 → 7895.04] in a lot of ways,
[7895.06 → 7896.76] it's actually stopping you from learning the thing.
[7896.90 → 7897.52] And again,
[7897.52 → 7898.66] that might be okay,
[7898.66 → 7899.82] depending on your objective.
[7900.60 → 7901.04] Um,
[7902.04 → 7904.30] but yeah,
[7904.50 → 7904.96] I mean,
[7904.96 → 7905.28] there's,
[7905.84 → 7906.82] who's ringing?
[7907.40 → 7907.56] Uh,
[7907.56 → 7908.26] that's me.
[7908.36 → 7908.72] Sorry.
[7909.00 → 7909.48] Um,
[7909.56 → 7910.16] it's,
[7910.24 → 7910.54] it's,
[7910.62 → 7910.92] um,
[7911.16 → 7912.08] I don't know.
[7912.26 → 7913.00] There's lots of,
[7913.14 → 7913.70] there's a
[7913.82 → 7915.76] what's that one company I've heard?
[7915.84 → 7916.38] They're cool.
[7916.52 → 7917.62] They do like Marian.
[7918.88 → 7919.32] Yeah.
[7919.74 → 7920.22] Um,
[7920.24 → 7920.50] no,
[7920.56 → 7920.74] it's,
[7920.82 → 7921.96] I don't remember what they're called,
[7922.02 → 7922.58] but they do.
[7922.84 → 7925.24] There's like a very gamified way of learning to code.
[7925.40 → 7929.04] How pathetic is it that I'm sitting here struggling to think of another cool company?
[7932.22 → 7932.62] Oh,
[7932.70 → 7934.88] the ones that have the kind of like friendly can.
[7935.34 → 7936.16] Do they still exist?
[7936.28 → 7936.84] Maybe that's it.
[7936.94 → 7937.40] I don't know.
[7938.40 → 7939.54] Elijah said boot.dev.
[7939.54 → 7940.26] I,
[7940.34 → 7941.44] I don't know much about them.
[7941.50 → 7942.30] I haven't used their service.
[7942.48 → 7942.80] I've heard,
[7942.80 → 7943.90] I've heard they're cool.
[7945.02 → 7946.32] This is the kid version.
[7946.54 → 7947.94] I think I was thinking of boot.dev,
[7948.06 → 7949.50] but I think this is the kid version.
[7949.68 → 7949.98] Okay.
[7950.20 → 7950.56] Um,
[7950.56 → 7952.44] does scratch have like a learning thing?
[7952.56 → 7953.62] I think it does,
[7953.78 → 7954.38] but that's a little,
[7954.82 → 7955.28] that is,
[7955.34 → 7957.04] that's a little before programming.
[7957.42 → 7958.58] It is very intro,
[7958.58 → 7962.40] but if you haven't done any learning yet on programming,
[7962.54 → 7963.56] scratch is really cool.
[7963.66 → 7965.62] You can actually do some surprisingly good things to scratch.
[7965.62 → 7966.76] Um,
[7967.10 → 7968.18] I think it's turning complete.
[7971.40 → 7971.84] Um,
[7971.96 → 7972.28] but,
[7972.28 → 7973.18] so it's PowerPoint.
[7973.18 → 7974.64] We've been sponsored by boot.dev before.
[7974.76 → 7974.98] Okay.
[7975.08 → 7975.52] I don't know.
[7975.66 → 7976.64] I don't pay that much attention.
[7977.28 → 7979.50] That isn't why I brought them up to be clear.
[7980.42 → 7980.86] Um,
[7981.50 → 7982.80] but yeah,
[7982.80 → 7983.22] I,
[7983.22 → 7985.14] I think it's kind of a neat idea,
[7985.14 → 7986.44] um,
[7986.82 → 7987.26] to,
[7987.60 → 7989.84] to make it kind of game so that it's fun,
[7989.90 → 7992.00] especially if you're doing this just for fun.
[7992.00 → 7993.66] I know we've done spots for boot.dev.
[7993.92 → 7994.10] Yeah.
[7994.12 → 7994.98] I just didn't remember.
[7995.34 → 7995.70] Um,
[7997.00 → 7997.62] coding game.
[7997.70 → 7998.60] Somebody said coding game.
[7998.84 → 7999.08] I don't know.
[7999.08 → 7999.20] Yeah.
[7999.22 → 8003.46] There's like near infinite ways to learn how to code these days.
[8003.46 → 8008.24] There are so many different services that you can subscribe to that have cool different angles on it.
[8008.48 → 8008.84] Um,
[8008.84 → 8010.60] there are tons of,
[8010.60 → 8012.74] of free information out there.
[8012.84 → 8017.52] There are YouTube tutorials more than you could possibly imagine.
[8017.70 → 8018.22] Uh,
[8018.44 → 8019.40] there's everything.
[8019.54 → 8019.64] Yeah.
[8019.64 → 8023.12] You mentioned that one that was like the 11-hour Godot tutorial.
[8023.70 → 8024.74] Amazing video.
[8024.90 → 8025.30] Incredible.
[8025.72 → 8026.66] Unlimited knowledge.
[8026.78 → 8027.02] Yeah.
[8027.30 → 8027.62] All right.
[8028.20 → 8030.56] Any long-term plans to either partner or,
[8030.56 → 8031.16] uh,
[8031.16 → 8035.20] partner with or create your own brick and mortar presence for LTT store products?
[8035.36 → 8036.30] If memory serves,
[8036.30 → 8038.36] did Micro Centre have the screwdriver for a while?
[8038.70 → 8040.04] How about a best buy?
[8040.94 → 8040.98] Um,
[8041.84 → 8045.26] retail partnerships are tough because this may surprise you,
[8045.26 → 8046.08] but retail,
[8046.08 → 8047.00] um,
[8047.36 → 8053.70] requires significant margin on the product that otherwise we could take for ourselves.
[8054.32 → 8054.68] Um,
[8054.68 → 8058.42] and retail also has a lot of baggage.
[8058.42 → 8059.10] Uh,
[8059.10 → 8059.62] retail,
[8059.94 → 8062.96] especially with a relatively small entity like us,
[8062.96 → 8067.44] will demand very challenging purchase terms.
[8067.44 → 8068.36] Um,
[8068.36 → 8069.58] so they'll pretty much say,
[8069.70 → 8069.80] yeah,
[8069.80 → 8071.50] we'll pay you when we feel like it.
[8072.04 → 8072.46] Um,
[8072.58 → 8073.42] any returns,
[8073.74 → 8075.52] you will simply eat them.
[8075.80 → 8076.08] Uh,
[8076.08 → 8077.74] we will just destroy them.
[8077.82 → 8079.68] We will not bother to return them to you.
[8079.72 → 8084.46] And things could be returned for reasons as trivial as a little dint on the packaging.
[8085.16 → 8085.60] And,
[8085.82 → 8086.34] um,
[8086.34 → 8088.72] yeah,
[8088.90 → 8091.74] like it or lump it.
[8092.52 → 8097.40] And if we had the kind of clout that we could negotiate a better deal than that,
[8097.40 → 8100.08] or if we had really deep margins on our products,
[8100.08 → 8101.48] then we'd be able to absorb that.
[8101.48 → 8105.30] But there's a reason that the direct to consumer model works.
[8105.96 → 8106.26] Um,
[8106.26 → 8106.96] and so we,
[8106.96 → 8110.98] we looked at it pretty recently and based on sort of our anticipated,
[8110.98 → 8113.86] we haven't talked to anyone about the specifics,
[8113.86 → 8118.90] but based on our anticipated expectations for the margins and the
[8119.08 → 8119.30] and the
[8119.40 → 8119.60] oh yeah,
[8119.68 → 8120.24] loss too.
[8120.46 → 8125.08] Like there's a lot more theft in a retail location than there is in a secure warehouse somewhere.
[8125.76 → 8126.20] Um,
[8126.24 → 8127.94] and they're not going to eat it.
[8128.24 → 8129.92] We're probably going to end up eating that too.
[8130.04 → 8131.12] So that one,
[8131.16 → 8131.74] I don't know for sure,
[8131.76 → 8132.70] but I do know the other ones.
[8132.88 → 8133.20] Uh,
[8133.20 → 8136.16] the point is just that it's,
[8136.24 → 8136.54] um,
[8136.88 → 8137.16] we,
[8137.16 → 8137.70] we did the
[8137.76 → 8143.12] we ran sort of some preliminary estimated numbers, and we compared that, and it would probably
[8143.12 → 8151.88] cost us less to just subsidize shipping on our key SKUs versus to give up the margin and overhead of having them in retail.
[8153.08 → 8156.28] There's a reason the detail is competitive.
[8156.86 → 8156.98] Yeah.
[8157.78 → 8158.30] All right,
[8158.36 → 8158.94] Linus and Luke.
[8159.08 → 8160.26] Do you think we will see another,
[8160.42 → 8166.18] in another couple of years of game performance stagnation because the user base will be running older hardware longer,
[8166.18 → 8168.50] like what happened during COVID,
[8168.84 → 8169.24] uh,
[8169.32 → 8169.74] i.e.
[8169.94 → 8171.02] PS4 and PS5.
[8172.20 → 8172.64] Um,
[8172.96 → 8175.20] the performance stagnation is an interesting,
[8175.94 → 8176.54] uh,
[8176.54 → 8177.14] for me,
[8177.14 → 8177.44] it's,
[8177.54 → 8177.80] it's,
[8177.90 → 8180.06] it more comes down to,
[8180.26 → 8181.56] because there's always a cycle,
[8181.66 → 8181.88] right?
[8182.00 → 8182.38] With,
[8182.50 → 8185.88] with consoles, and you're going to see a new console is going to come out.
[8185.94 → 8189.30] That's going to push the boundaries in terms of what game developers can,
[8189.42 → 8191.10] can build to run on it.
[8191.10 → 8196.08] And then for a while there will be pretty much no point for any cross-platform game,
[8196.18 → 8196.74] uh,
[8196.74 → 8200.02] targeting anything other than sort of approximately that,
[8200.16 → 8202.84] but plus or minus some bells and whistles.
[8203.54 → 8203.98] Um,
[8204.04 → 8210.14] and then you'll get a new console and there'll be like kind of two to three year leg as games that were actually started development,
[8210.36 → 8211.84] targeting that console start to come out.
[8211.86 → 8212.14] And then,
[8212.14 → 8212.80] uh,
[8212.80 → 8215.52] you'll see sort of a benefit to having a higher end PC there.
[8215.60 → 8215.80] So that,
[8215.86 → 8216.70] that's part of it.
[8216.70 → 8219.98] But the other part of it is that for,
[8220.30 → 8223.64] I feel like almost kind of two super cycles.
[8223.82 → 8224.04] Now,
[8224.18 → 8224.88] uh,
[8224.88 → 8232.56] we've reached the point where the gating factor is just how much bloody work it is for developers to build bigger and bigger games.
[8232.66 → 8234.44] You can't just expect a bigger,
[8234.64 → 8235.76] prettier game every time,
[8235.76 → 8237.02] unless the company is,
[8237.06 → 8237.28] you know,
[8237.34 → 8241.54] rock star where they will spend literally the better part of a decade working on a game.
[8241.88 → 8242.22] I don't know.
[8242.22 → 8243.28] Hundreds of millions of dollars,
[8243.38 → 8243.60] you know,
[8243.60 → 8245.56] I don't know if you want to say it's a bigger game,
[8245.56 → 8245.84] but,
[8245.92 → 8246.22] uh,
[8246.22 → 8247.10] looking at again,
[8247.18 → 8248.38] embark studios for,
[8248.52 → 8250.34] for art graders in the finals.
[8250.98 → 8251.42] Um,
[8251.94 → 8254.58] those games run really well, actually.
[8254.88 → 8255.50] And like,
[8255.54 → 8256.82] look pretty great.
[8257.14 → 8258.60] So it's still possible.
[8259.00 → 8263.56] I think there hasn't been a ton of incentives for companies to focus on that in a long time.
[8263.78 → 8264.22] Yeah,
[8264.24 → 8264.74] that's true.
[8264.82 → 8267.40] And that might be changing a little bit,
[8267.48 → 8268.56] maybe potentially.
[8268.90 → 8269.74] I don't know.
[8269.90 → 8270.20] Ram.
[8270.42 → 8272.20] I was wondering what the impacts on Chrome,
[8272.20 → 8275.70] like does Chrome development change a little bit because of Ram limitations,
[8275.84 → 8277.24] right?
[8277.28 → 8279.58] Like if your product just isn't competitive because,
[8279.58 → 8280.28] uh,
[8280.28 → 8281.12] the installation base,
[8281.20 → 8282.50] I would rather use some other browser.
[8282.50 → 8283.66] That's less memory hungry.
[8283.66 → 8287.60] I don't think that's going to be enough to destabilize Chrome,
[8287.74 → 8288.42] just to be clear.
[8288.88 → 8289.32] But it's,
[8289.34 → 8291.28] it's just an interesting thought experiment of like,
[8291.56 → 8291.72] we're,
[8291.76 → 8295.54] we're hearing companies significantly limiting Ram on devices.
[8295.54 → 8296.54] Like I wasn't,
[8296.58 → 8296.82] wasn't,
[8296.90 → 8298.54] wasn't one of them limiting to eight gigs,
[8298.82 → 8300.34] eight gigs in 2026,
[8300.76 → 8300.96] bro.
[8301.60 → 8302.00] Dang.
[8302.24 → 8302.36] Yeah.
[8302.38 → 8302.86] That's not great.
[8302.90 → 8303.50] Like that's,
[8303.54 → 8306.04] I can get Chrome to eight gigs real fast.
[8306.28 → 8306.98] There's also,
[8307.10 → 8307.30] man,
[8307.36 → 8312.00] another major factor is that the lead times on all this stuff is so long that if I was starting
[8312.00 → 8313.66] in the development of a game today,
[8313.66 → 8316.04] I wouldn't even be accounting for the Ram shortage.
[8316.16 → 8316.30] Nope.
[8316.44 → 8317.82] By the time I released my game,
[8317.90 → 8319.38] the Ram shortage will be in the rearview mirror.
[8319.88 → 8323.12] So yeah.
[8323.12 → 8323.40] And,
[8323.46 → 8326.40] and then anything that was already started is going to be,
[8326.62 → 8327.64] wasn't accounting for it anyway.
[8327.84 → 8328.40] And you can tune,
[8328.70 → 8329.84] you can optimize.
[8331.22 → 8331.70] I,
[8331.70 → 8332.18] I,
[8332.28 → 8333.48] I don't,
[8333.48 → 8337.14] I don't think that it will be a major factor.
[8337.34 → 8340.58] I also don't think that your,
[8340.76 → 8341.60] even your premise,
[8341.60 → 8342.28] um,
[8342.68 → 8343.02] is,
[8343.08 → 8344.50] is necessarily correct.
[8345.02 → 8345.30] Uh,
[8345.32 → 8348.02] Nvidia's gaming revenue is up 30%.
[8348.02 → 8351.54] So this entire premise of that everyone's running older hardware.
[8351.78 → 8352.00] So,
[8352.50 → 8353.18] you know,
[8353.34 → 8353.54] no,
[8353.62 → 8353.84] they're,
[8353.84 → 8358.54] they're specifying PS4 and PS5 because games often target console performance.
[8358.64 → 8358.72] They,
[8358.76 → 8359.12] they see,
[8359.24 → 8360.24] they say older heart.
[8360.56 → 8361.80] Like what happened then?
[8362.22 → 8362.34] No,
[8362.36 → 8362.46] no,
[8362.46 → 8365.00] they're saying it's happening now because of prices going up.
[8365.00 → 8366.52] We'll be running older hardware.
[8366.72 → 8367.60] Like what happened during COVID.
[8367.76 → 8369.00] I eat PS4 and PS5.
[8369.18 → 8369.40] Yeah.
[8369.40 → 8370.86] So,
[8370.86 → 8372.46] so I don't,
[8372.56 → 8372.64] I,
[8372.76 → 8373.86] people are not,
[8373.92 → 8376.46] not buying computers right now.
[8376.92 → 8377.56] They are.
[8377.76 → 8380.08] And the thing that I talked about earlier,
[8380.68 → 8381.18] where like,
[8381.22 → 8385.00] I understand why people are angry that Ram is more expensive and that's totally valid,
[8385.00 → 8392.36] but like buying a computer relative to everything else around us in the world is also more affordable than ever.
[8392.36 → 8393.50] Just like TVs,
[8393.98 → 8403.62] TVs and computers have been shockingly inflation proof over the entire span of my lifetime to the point where I feel like we just take it for granted.
[8404.88 → 8406.08] We can't.
[8406.58 → 8409.92] So I guess maybe that's what I didn't explain very well earlier is that's maybe,
[8409.92 → 8413.06] maybe that's the perspective adjustment we need is like,
[8413.06 → 8416.54] do not take this for granted.
[8416.92 → 8420.76] The fact that things are as good as they are is actually a modern miracle.
[8421.20 → 8422.80] It could be so much worse.
[8423.02 → 8424.06] We know it can be,
[8424.62 → 8426.48] and we're looking for it to get back there.
[8426.60 → 8427.48] We wish it were better,
[8428.16 → 8429.58] but it could be so much worse.
[8429.58 → 8433.36] I think they don't take it for granted thing is probably a stronger angle personally.
[8433.88 → 8434.24] Um,
[8434.74 → 8435.28] all right.
[8435.82 → 8437.10] Last one I got for you today.
[8437.56 → 8437.72] Hello,
[8437.84 → 8438.40] WAN.dll.
[8438.60 → 8442.26] I've heard a lot of debates surrounding MSPs and whether they are effective.
[8442.72 → 8447.16] What are your opinions on using an MSP instead of doing everything in-house?
[8447.94 → 8449.42] Medical services plan?
[8451.82 → 8452.90] Managed service provider,
[8453.00 → 8453.86] I think is what they mean.
[8454.84 → 8455.28] Um,
[8455.74 → 8456.74] so like,
[8456.74 → 8457.06] uh,
[8457.06 → 8458.32] out of house IT is,
[8458.46 → 8459.36] I think what they're referencing.
[8460.12 → 8460.52] Um,
[8460.64 → 8463.20] I've heard places that have done it very effectively.
[8463.40 → 8468.24] I've also heard a lot of stories of places switching to something like this and then being like,
[8468.40 → 8469.18] oh no,
[8469.48 → 8470.42] it's terrible.
[8470.44 → 8472.56] And then trying to go back to what they had before,
[8472.56 → 8474.48] but now they fired all their people.
[8474.48 → 8478.12] So they can't get those people back because they've gone other places now.
[8478.12 → 8480.52] And then things are just really tribal knowledge.
[8480.66 → 8481.10] Yeah.
[8481.66 → 8482.10] Um,
[8482.10 → 8483.88] I think at large companies,
[8483.88 → 8486.48] a mix probably makes a decent amount of sense.
[8487.18 → 8487.62] Um,
[8487.62 → 8489.70] okay.
[8489.84 → 8490.48] Comments in,
[8490.48 → 8491.00] in chat,
[8491.08 → 8491.74] uh,
[8491.74 → 8492.32] really on.
[8492.40 → 8493.16] We have an MSP.
[8493.28 → 8494.40] It effing sucks.
[8494.50 → 8494.72] Uh,
[8494.72 → 8496.50] Van ok working for an MSP.
[8496.60 → 8497.58] I want to die.
[8497.58 → 8498.02] Uh,
[8500.32 → 8500.82] Fox,
[8501.18 → 8501.56] Jason.
[8501.84 → 8503.10] I worked for MSP.
[8503.24 → 8503.62] Nope.
[8503.94 → 8504.26] Uh,
[8504.28 → 8504.56] yeah,
[8504.66 → 8505.20] I think,
[8505.28 → 8506.14] I think the
[8506.68 → 8506.92] like,
[8507.02 → 8507.22] oh,
[8507.24 → 8510.36] we can just outsource everything and put everything in the cloud and nothing has to be local anymore,
[8510.42 → 8510.62] ever.
[8510.62 → 8511.30] Or even people,
[8511.66 → 8512.14] um,
[8512.20 → 8515.50] that whole idea didn't turn out as well as people hoped.
[8515.72 → 8517.20] And there's a
[8517.20 → 8517.78] uh,
[8518.26 → 8518.64] there's a
[8518.70 → 8523.10] there's a pretty big benefit to just having your own IT people that understand your space,
[8523.40 → 8524.52] understand your environment,
[8524.68 → 8525.20] know your people.
[8525.20 → 8525.50] And can,
[8525.50 → 8525.94] yep.
[8526.32 → 8529.70] And can adapt things well and understand the needs of individual people.
[8529.70 → 8532.12] And like people who might be working in different departments,
[8532.12 → 8533.22] doing specific things,
[8533.48 → 8533.74] et cetera.
[8533.74 → 8535.84] All right.
[8536.34 → 8536.74] Unfortunately,
[8536.98 → 8537.34] everyone,
[8537.52 → 8539.60] I have a hard out right now.
[8539.66 → 8540.34] I've got to go.
[8541.02 → 8541.34] And,
[8541.40 → 8541.88] um,
[8542.92 → 8545.26] and I got work to do.
[8545.68 → 8546.16] Nice.
[8546.20 → 8546.34] Yeah.
[8546.36 → 8549.42] It's so weird when we do when it is extremely strange.
[8549.52 → 8550.68] My brain starts to shut down.
[8550.68 → 8551.04] Actually,
[8551.04 → 8552.60] it's like not good.
[8552.72 → 8553.48] it's like conditioned.
[8553.66 → 8553.94] Yes.
[8554.12 → 8559.04] Like we have not missed a Friday when show since like the start of COVID lockdown.
[8559.22 → 8559.46] Yeah.
[8559.58 → 8562.10] Like it's been five years.
[8562.10 → 8564.22] So on Friday when I say the thing.
[8564.72 → 8564.94] Yeah.
[8565.00 → 8566.12] Which hasn't been said yet.
[8566.20 → 8566.72] It hasn't been said.
[8566.78 → 8567.18] Don't do it.
[8567.42 → 8568.20] I like,
[8568.30 → 8572.22] I have this like energy let down that is like relatively extreme, actually.
[8572.36 → 8572.50] Yeah.
[8572.54 → 8574.86] I don't know how to not go lock up the building.
[8575.06 → 8575.28] Yep.
[8575.36 → 8576.78] And like go home and sleep.
[8576.86 → 8577.32] It's weird.
[8577.58 → 8577.74] Yeah.
[8577.74 → 8580.62] It has happened where I've just like wandered for a second and then been like,
[8580.74 → 8581.62] Oh yeah,
[8581.72 → 8583.42] I guess I'll go to my desk.
[8583.50 → 8583.70] Yeah.
[8583.80 → 8583.96] Oh,
[8583.96 → 8585.14] it's super Tripp.
[8585.14 → 8585.82] It's very odd.
[8586.04 → 8586.16] Yeah.
[8586.16 → 8587.80] It's probably the same for a lot of them too,
[8587.88 → 8588.26] actually.
[8588.38 → 8588.94] Wouldn't be surprised.
[8589.22 → 8592.08] Like if they're used to when show at a particular time in there,
[8592.10 → 8592.58] time zone,
[8592.68 → 8593.68] just being like the ritual.
[8594.06 → 8594.24] Yeah.
[8594.44 → 8595.16] Cause like,
[8595.20 → 8595.58] I mean,
[8595.62 → 8595.96] it's,
[8596.58 → 8596.80] you know,
[8596.82 → 8599.12] we're not like the biggest live stream in the world or anything,
[8599.12 → 8602.06] but there's like probably a solid 10,000 people watching.
[8602.58 → 8604.20] And I would say out of those,
[8604.30 → 8607.16] just based on the names that I see a lot of,
[8607.22 → 8608.40] with a lot of regularity.
[8608.66 → 8608.80] Yeah.
[8608.86 → 8611.84] There's a lot of people for whom the wind show is like part of their Friday
[8611.84 → 8612.36] routine.
[8612.62 → 8612.82] Yeah.
[8613.04 → 8614.00] And it's just like,
[8614.10 → 8615.28] yeah,
[8615.28 → 8617.48] we'll try to get back to a more regular schedule.
[8617.64 → 8620.64] It's just Q4 and the holiday season and all that stuff.
[8620.86 → 8620.88] Well,
[8620.94 → 8621.82] things have been a little wild.
[8621.92 → 8622.08] Yeah.
