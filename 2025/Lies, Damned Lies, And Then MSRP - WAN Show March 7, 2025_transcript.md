[0.00 --> 11.34]  What is up everyone? Another day, another launch where the MSRP cards are either nowhere to be found or very tiny few to be found.
[11.34 --> 20.58]  We're going to be getting into that, talking about both the launch of the RTX 5070 and Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT.
[20.86 --> 28.24]  We will also be talking about an article that is from last week, but I think still merits some discussion today.
[28.24 --> 38.14]  Tech Radar says pre-built are always superior. That is the honest truth, unless you are an IT god.
[39.32 --> 41.94]  Um, what? Okay, what else we got for this week?
[42.20 --> 43.36]  What a week it's going to be.
[44.34 --> 52.36]  For the seven people that care, Mozilla rewrites Firefox's terms of use after user backlash, and they're bringing back Dig.
[54.24 --> 56.50]  Which, I mean, that might be good.
[56.50 --> 58.08]  I'm digging it. Get it?
[58.18 --> 59.94]  Maybe? Yeah. Yeah!
[59.94 --> 60.06]  Yeah!
[60.06 --> 85.84]  The show is brought to you today by Squarespace, Vessi, Corsair, and of course, our rap partner, Dbrand,
[85.84 --> 89.32]  and our laptop partner, Dell, and our chair partner,
[89.86 --> 90.46]  oop, there it is.
[90.54 --> 90.94]  Oh, sorry.
[91.34 --> 93.40]  I gotta cover it up, because it's a secret.
[94.70 --> 95.06]  Shh!
[95.82 --> 96.82]  Secret lab.
[97.08 --> 97.74]  Ha ha ha!
[97.74 --> 98.28]  I get it?
[98.32 --> 98.54]  Alright.
[98.96 --> 105.08]  Why don't we jump right into our first topic today, which is, of course, going to be the big launches this week.
[105.22 --> 105.84]  Adam put...
[106.98 --> 113.10]  Gosh darn it, he put so much work into preparing this topic that I'm gonna do my very best to read as much of it as I can
[113.10 --> 115.56]  without getting exhausted.
[116.40 --> 121.34]  NVIDIA and AMD have launched their 70 class cards, and boy, were they doozies.
[121.44 --> 124.60]  Here's a rundown from worst to less worst.
[125.00 --> 127.26]  The NVIDIA RTX 5070.
[127.50 --> 131.10]  Turns out, no, it does not, in fact, have 4090 performance.
[131.50 --> 131.66]  Dude.
[131.74 --> 131.90]  What?
[132.14 --> 132.38]  Dude.
[132.38 --> 137.28]  You were there with me when I filmed that little clip where I, like, did the little quip to Austin, right?
[137.34 --> 138.26]  Or had you joined us yet?
[139.00 --> 139.86]  I don't think you had.
[140.70 --> 141.48]  Never mind, I lied.
[141.94 --> 144.52]  Because we were at the keynote together, but Luke was sitting somewhere else.
[144.54 --> 145.34]  He had better seats.
[145.72 --> 150.34]  And then I just went where they shepherded us into the press area where we were like,
[150.40 --> 155.54]  oh, okay, so I guess we're, like, third class citizens after the investors and the analysts.
[155.84 --> 158.18]  Because that's what NVIDIA's into these days.
[158.18 --> 168.04]  Anywho, I didn't have great seats, but I was able to hear Jensen say that the upcoming RTX 5070 at 549 or 649 or whatever,
[168.22 --> 171.84]  549 would match the performance of the 4090.
[172.42 --> 178.02]  And at the time, my camera guy, Andrew, was like, do you want me, like, filming this?
[178.08 --> 181.70]  I'm like, buddy, we're at a press conference.
[182.32 --> 186.54]  A, everyone and their dog is already filming it, as you can see.
[186.54 --> 192.26]  So we are contributing literally nothing to the Zeitgeist, or however you pronounce that.
[193.42 --> 193.72]  Zeit.
[194.00 --> 194.62]  Thank you.
[194.80 --> 195.00]  Zeitgeist.
[195.14 --> 201.22]  Oh, man, I got dunked on for my pronunciation of wunderkind.
[202.02 --> 203.16]  Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[203.26 --> 204.54]  The point is I said it wrong.
[206.34 --> 208.48]  Anywho, we are contributing absolutely nothing.
[208.64 --> 211.84]  Literally anything we record here of the stage is redundant,
[211.84 --> 215.96]  because everyone else and their dog has their cameras out recording it.
[216.06 --> 220.70]  And number two, what they're doing is completely redundant anyway,
[220.70 --> 222.86]  because NVIDIA is live streaming the whole thing,
[222.90 --> 226.82]  and you could get a way better quality version of it from YouTube.
[227.52 --> 231.32]  The gamer move seemed to be, I know, I think Bitwig Kyle did this,
[231.40 --> 232.98]  and a few other people, but I don't remember who,
[233.38 --> 236.64]  where they just restreamed the broadcast and stayed home.
[237.44 --> 237.68]  Yeah.
[237.72 --> 239.06]  And then just commentated over it.
[239.16 --> 239.56]  Well, yeah.
[240.04 --> 241.56]  And got tons of live viewers.
[241.76 --> 243.30]  It was, like, very, very serious.
[243.30 --> 246.26]  I mean, dude, I told NVIDIA, I don't go to press conferences.
[246.46 --> 250.64]  The only reason I was there was because we were supposed to go get hands-on with the 5090.
[250.74 --> 253.98]  Anyway, the point is, I was there when Jensen said it,
[254.34 --> 256.34]  and in that moment, I was like,
[256.40 --> 258.76]  yo, Andrew, I know I told you that we're not filming anything,
[258.76 --> 261.14]  but get the camera out, get the camera.
[261.26 --> 263.26]  I got mic'd up, like, put on the mic.
[263.34 --> 263.54]  Okay.
[263.54 --> 265.00]  And I got that clip.
[265.24 --> 267.04]  Dude, that clip has been,
[267.16 --> 269.46]  I'm going to get so much mileage out of that,
[269.80 --> 271.22]  I'll believe it when I see it clip.
[271.24 --> 274.98]  Because every time NVIDIA says something that is just complete bullshit,
[275.36 --> 277.22]  I'm going to be able to pull out that clip.
[277.30 --> 277.98]  Just pull it out again.
[278.02 --> 280.92]  Of me at the press conference for the 5090 launch,
[281.16 --> 283.44]  being like, I'll believe it when I see it.
[284.28 --> 284.96]  So, yeah.
[284.96 --> 287.64]  Well, you would have been able to pull it out for every single NVIDIA launch
[287.64 --> 288.82]  that I have personally seen.
[289.86 --> 292.60]  It's about 20% faster than a 4070,
[292.60 --> 297.36]  barely nets a single-digit percent increase over the 4070 Super.
[297.80 --> 300.50]  It's 12 gigs of VRAM poses longevity concerns,
[300.58 --> 302.02]  especially at 4K,
[302.44 --> 305.20]  and it is pretty much non-existent at retail.
[305.60 --> 308.38]  While those quick to the punch were able to get their hands on a card,
[308.56 --> 310.62]  most folks were unable to find them at MSRP,
[311.18 --> 313.96]  and the more expensive partner cards,
[314.10 --> 317.18]  even those ones sold out shortly afterward.
[317.18 --> 321.14]  Adam included a picture from PC Part Picker,
[321.54 --> 324.38]  where there is only one card in stock,
[324.78 --> 326.28]  and this is a 5070,
[326.68 --> 330.32]  a card with a $549 MSRP,
[330.74 --> 334.06]  and it is priced at $1,029
[334.06 --> 338.50]  as of 4.20 p.m. March 6th.
[338.50 --> 338.90]  Nice.
[340.26 --> 341.24]  Hashtag blaze it.
[341.48 --> 342.44]  Your money, that is.
[342.60 --> 343.42]  Yeah, sweet.
[343.42 --> 344.66]  Just light it on fire.
[344.66 --> 345.20]  You have to do that.
[345.24 --> 346.20]  Light it all on fire.
[347.04 --> 347.28]  Yeah.
[347.62 --> 348.04]  AMD,
[348.34 --> 351.20]  things went a bit better,
[351.50 --> 354.52]  but it looks like the story is complicated.
[355.08 --> 357.32]  It was a much better received launch,
[357.52 --> 359.36]  including by yours truly.
[359.84 --> 364.26]  The 9070 has the same MSRP as the 5070 from NVIDIA,
[364.36 --> 368.26]  while being about 9% faster at 1440p and 4K raster.
[368.26 --> 373.92]  In ray tracing, the 9070 beats out the previous flagship 7900 XTX,
[374.02 --> 376.42]  which launched at an MSRP of $1,000,
[376.96 --> 380.76]  but actually fell behind the 5070 in our testing,
[381.08 --> 384.76]  though other outlets found that it was within 5-7%
[384.76 --> 387.00]  across their suite of ray traced games.
[387.42 --> 390.70]  We did notice that the worst performance for the 9070
[390.70 --> 393.08]  was in Black Myth Wukong,
[393.34 --> 397.36]  where it seems AMD is still struggling a little bit.
[397.36 --> 400.12]  It gets 16 gigs of GDDR6, though,
[400.20 --> 401.92]  which gives us a little bit more confidence
[401.92 --> 404.66]  that it will continue to be able to keep up in the future
[404.66 --> 406.26]  without seeing lag spikes,
[406.48 --> 408.80]  and was in stock for substantially longer,
[408.90 --> 410.36]  actually several hours,
[410.72 --> 412.18]  rather than several minutes.
[412.92 --> 416.16]  Meanwhile, the 9070 XT competes in performance
[416.16 --> 420.62]  with the 5070 Ti and AMD's 7900 XTX in raster,
[420.98 --> 421.70]  and in ray tracing,
[422.02 --> 425.60]  it competes and even beats the 5070 in several titles.
[425.60 --> 428.04]  Great card, undercuts NVIDIA's offerings in price,
[428.16 --> 429.78]  brings ray tracing to a serviceable level,
[430.08 --> 432.56]  and is generally pretty good.
[434.00 --> 437.34]  However, however, oh yeah, FSR 4 looks pretty good.
[437.74 --> 440.22]  Image quality no more distracting than DLSS 4,
[440.58 --> 442.80]  and outlets who have done deep dives into the image quality
[442.80 --> 445.66]  rated as matching the DLSS CNN model,
[445.76 --> 447.08]  but lags behind in some areas
[447.08 --> 449.70]  compared to NVIDIA's latest transformer model.
[449.70 --> 454.36]  However, it's not all sunshine and roses for AMD,
[454.76 --> 457.04]  and there's going to be a number of sources
[457.04 --> 458.32]  that we're going to be talking about,
[458.68 --> 461.68]  so stick with me for a little bit here, guys,
[461.74 --> 465.56]  because there's a lot of sides to this story.
[467.14 --> 469.92]  VideoCards, with a Z, dot com.
[470.70 --> 471.90]  Oh, that makes sense,
[472.28 --> 474.88]  because video cards with an S wouldn't exist,
[474.88 --> 478.68]  because you'd have to have, like, video cards.
[480.00 --> 481.02]  Hey, I get it.
[481.10 --> 482.50]  They were planning for the future.
[482.60 --> 485.58]  They had a crystal ball when they bought that domain.
[486.36 --> 487.02]  Oh, boy.
[487.02 --> 491.48]  Anyway, they got a quote from OCUK's Andrew Gibson,
[491.76 --> 492.24]  who stated,
[493.16 --> 496.36]  MSRP is a capped quantity of a few hundred,
[496.86 --> 500.04]  so prices will jump once those are sold through.
[500.68 --> 503.36]  They also received insight about rebates
[503.36 --> 505.92]  from Swedish retailer Inet.se,
[506.22 --> 508.96]  who claimed that MSRP prices will apply
[508.96 --> 510.82]  to a limited number of cards.
[511.26 --> 515.72]  The prices only apply to the first shipment of each model.
[516.26 --> 518.16]  I have a note in here from Adam,
[518.20 --> 519.18]  who prepared this topic.
[519.54 --> 522.42]  Linus, can you comment on this sort of rebate behavior?
[522.86 --> 524.18]  Is this commonplace?
[524.56 --> 526.86]  My experience in the grocery industry knows
[526.86 --> 528.14]  that this isn't out of the ordinary,
[528.36 --> 530.60]  but I also sold jam and shortening,
[531.00 --> 532.74]  so not sure how that translates.
[532.74 --> 534.96]  What I will say is this.
[536.32 --> 541.10]  Back when I was working in retail,
[541.80 --> 547.64]  demand for the latest GPU was not like it is today.
[547.64 --> 550.74]  I would say,
[551.36 --> 552.72]  under normal circumstances,
[553.54 --> 556.10]  yes, there are elements of this launch
[556.10 --> 558.32]  that would seem pretty wild
[558.32 --> 560.02]  if you haven't worked in the industry before,
[560.28 --> 561.52]  but are kind of normal,
[561.70 --> 564.68]  like the fact that pricing didn't seem to be finalized
[564.68 --> 567.70]  up until the hours before the launch,
[568.00 --> 569.72]  and I'll talk a little bit more about that later.
[570.06 --> 571.04]  That's not unusual.
[571.78 --> 573.24]  I'm not saying it's good.
[573.62 --> 574.54]  It's not good.
[574.54 --> 576.14]  It's absolute madness,
[576.44 --> 578.54]  but it's not unusual.
[578.92 --> 581.20]  We would regularly cut POs
[581.20 --> 586.36]  for literally like hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs
[586.36 --> 589.42]  and have no idea what our cost was for them
[589.42 --> 591.74]  and what our MSRP was going to be for them.
[592.04 --> 593.84]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars of GPUs,
[594.34 --> 597.36]  like hundreds of top spec cards,
[597.36 --> 600.04]  and we literally wouldn't have a price,
[600.58 --> 602.18]  EVGA wouldn't have a price,
[602.44 --> 604.72]  and our direct NVIDIA rep wouldn't have a price.
[604.82 --> 605.38]  They're just like,
[606.08 --> 606.64]  buy them.
[606.98 --> 608.18]  This is your allocation.
[609.14 --> 609.68]  Take them,
[609.88 --> 611.32]  or someone else will take them.
[611.68 --> 612.24]  And you're like,
[613.42 --> 614.58]  okay,
[614.92 --> 616.64]  because what else are you going to do?
[616.74 --> 618.36]  You don't have any GPUs to sell.
[618.46 --> 620.16]  What, your computer store with no GPUs?
[620.16 --> 621.06]  It's ridiculous, right?
[621.40 --> 622.40]  So you just take them,
[622.50 --> 623.30]  and that's it.
[623.74 --> 624.32]  You cut a PO.
[627.24 --> 627.76]  However,
[628.18 --> 629.36]  what I will say
[629.36 --> 631.38]  is that the idea
[631.38 --> 632.82]  of having
[632.82 --> 635.30]  a rebate
[635.30 --> 636.24]  like this,
[636.30 --> 637.24]  like an instant rebate,
[637.32 --> 639.64]  because there's different kinds of rebates.
[639.76 --> 639.86]  Okay,
[639.90 --> 641.22]  so there's your mail-in rebates.
[641.56 --> 644.08]  Those are the ones that have the little form you fill out
[644.08 --> 645.06]  for the consumer,
[645.58 --> 647.28]  and they send in,
[647.40 --> 648.16]  they mail in the form
[648.16 --> 649.58]  and they get some money back.
[649.96 --> 651.42]  The redemption rates on those
[651.42 --> 654.18]  are somewhere between 10% and 50%,
[654.18 --> 656.20]  depending on the size of the rebate.
[656.46 --> 657.32]  The smaller ones
[657.32 --> 659.12]  tend to have a very low redemption rate,
[659.16 --> 659.98]  and the higher ones
[659.98 --> 662.14]  tend to have a much higher redemption rate
[662.14 --> 663.52]  once you go past a certain number.
[663.82 --> 665.94]  Don't quote me on those exact numbers.
[666.08 --> 667.14]  It's been a minute,
[667.14 --> 668.22]  and consumer behavior
[668.22 --> 669.40]  might have changed a little bit,
[669.70 --> 670.50]  but the point is just
[670.50 --> 671.86]  that there's a wide range of redemption,
[671.86 --> 675.28]  and the people who do redeem it
[675.28 --> 677.12]  are essentially being subsidized
[677.12 --> 678.36]  by the people who don't redeem it.
[678.40 --> 679.60]  That's the way the math works
[679.60 --> 681.30]  on mail-in rebate.
[681.68 --> 682.90]  So there's your mail-in rebate.
[683.08 --> 683.24]  Okay?
[683.74 --> 684.10]  Then,
[684.26 --> 685.78]  there is your kind of
[685.78 --> 687.28]  point of sale rebate,
[687.44 --> 688.14]  POS rebate,
[688.32 --> 690.20]  and that's going to take place
[690.20 --> 691.88]  at the point of sale,
[691.96 --> 692.54]  and those are
[692.54 --> 694.56]  kind of like a commission
[694.56 --> 695.70]  or a spiff
[695.70 --> 698.74]  for like a salesperson,
[698.94 --> 701.38]  but it goes at the retailer level.
[701.38 --> 702.32]  So you're expected
[702.32 --> 703.34]  to kind of use it
[703.34 --> 705.14]  for a short-term promotion,
[705.14 --> 707.20]  and the idea is
[707.20 --> 708.72]  that you're driving sales
[708.72 --> 710.16]  during some kind of an event,
[710.58 --> 712.24]  like March AMD-ness
[712.24 --> 713.88]  for March Madness.
[713.98 --> 714.88]  AMD usually does
[714.88 --> 716.60]  like a basketball-themed promo
[716.60 --> 717.56]  for March Madness,
[717.86 --> 718.68]  March AMD-ness.
[718.96 --> 720.00]  So that would usually
[720.00 --> 721.02]  have something like
[721.02 --> 722.32]  a POS rebate
[722.32 --> 723.78]  across bundles
[723.78 --> 724.74]  of AMD products
[724.74 --> 725.82]  or partner products
[725.82 --> 726.82]  in order to kind of
[726.82 --> 727.78]  push up the volumes
[727.78 --> 728.54]  during that time.
[728.54 --> 730.22]  The last kind
[730.22 --> 731.18]  would be
[731.18 --> 732.70]  like a price protection
[732.70 --> 734.14]  slash
[734.14 --> 737.94]  like instant rebate.
[737.94 --> 738.58]  Instant rebate,
[738.70 --> 738.86]  actually,
[738.98 --> 739.84]  that's more of a terminology
[739.84 --> 740.56]  for POS rebate,
[740.62 --> 741.66]  but like a price protection.
[742.30 --> 742.50]  So,
[742.74 --> 743.44]  like a credit,
[743.52 --> 744.50]  essentially a credit
[744.50 --> 745.62]  where they are
[745.62 --> 747.12]  taking your entire
[747.12 --> 748.58]  inventory that you have
[748.58 --> 749.34]  and they are
[749.34 --> 750.64]  price protecting you down
[750.64 --> 751.70]  to a new,
[752.76 --> 753.22]  presumably,
[753.86 --> 755.00]  permanent price.
[755.00 --> 756.12]  And that would happen
[756.12 --> 756.74]  in the event
[756.74 --> 757.64]  that you had something
[757.64 --> 758.62]  like a significant
[758.62 --> 759.58]  price drop.
[759.90 --> 760.78]  So I would say
[760.78 --> 762.10]  the only example
[762.10 --> 762.96]  of that
[762.96 --> 764.16]  that I remember seeing
[764.16 --> 765.24]  was when NVIDIA
[765.24 --> 768.00]  launched the GTX 480
[768.00 --> 770.02]  or 480 GTX,
[770.08 --> 770.50]  excuse me.
[770.56 --> 771.18]  I've got my,
[771.18 --> 772.28]  my prefixes
[772.28 --> 772.94]  and suffixes
[772.94 --> 773.70]  moved around
[773.70 --> 774.38]  because NVIDIA
[774.38 --> 775.12]  moved them around.
[776.24 --> 777.40]  NVIDIA launched
[777.40 --> 778.10]  that card
[778.10 --> 779.12]  thinking that
[779.12 --> 780.10]  it was going to sell
[780.10 --> 781.48]  and it like
[781.48 --> 783.00]  didn't.
[783.00 --> 783.96]  I think,
[784.24 --> 785.64]  I think that was
[785.64 --> 786.66]  probably the worst
[786.66 --> 788.20]  NVIDIA card launch
[788.20 --> 789.42]  that I saw
[789.42 --> 790.70]  in my,
[790.80 --> 791.34]  in my years
[791.34 --> 792.32]  working at NCIX.
[792.62 --> 792.68]  We,
[792.72 --> 793.38]  effectively,
[793.38 --> 794.18]  they were dead
[794.18 --> 794.68]  in the water
[794.68 --> 795.36]  on launch day.
[795.98 --> 796.78]  And so,
[797.10 --> 798.22]  what happened was
[798.22 --> 799.40]  we had our inventory
[799.40 --> 800.46]  that we had bought
[800.46 --> 801.06]  without knowing
[801.06 --> 801.66]  how much we were
[801.66 --> 802.42]  paying for it
[802.42 --> 804.44]  and we basically went,
[804.60 --> 805.08]  look guys,
[805.50 --> 806.48]  you f***ed this.
[807.36 --> 808.34]  You need to deal
[808.34 --> 808.86]  with this.
[809.36 --> 809.68]  And so,
[809.78 --> 810.86]  we got our stock
[810.86 --> 811.66]  price protected
[811.66 --> 812.34]  down.
[812.34 --> 813.60]  If I recall correctly,
[813.66 --> 814.30]  it may have also
[814.30 --> 815.24]  been a POS rebate,
[815.42 --> 816.56]  but one that was like,
[817.16 --> 818.92]  this is a POS rebate,
[819.28 --> 820.00]  but it,
[820.24 --> 820.84]  the understanding
[820.84 --> 821.44]  was that it was
[821.44 --> 822.56]  perpetual to help us
[822.56 --> 823.74]  get rid of this stuff
[823.74 --> 823.98]  and,
[824.06 --> 824.74]  and they effectively
[824.74 --> 825.58]  adjusted the price
[825.58 --> 826.08]  of that thing.
[827.98 --> 828.42]  So,
[828.60 --> 829.68]  with all of that
[829.68 --> 830.14]  in mind,
[830.92 --> 831.90]  the idea
[831.90 --> 833.58]  of a new card
[833.58 --> 834.12]  arriving
[834.12 --> 836.22]  and some portion
[836.22 --> 837.60]  of my inventory
[837.60 --> 838.52]  being
[838.52 --> 840.14]  instant rebated
[840.14 --> 841.14]  included
[841.14 --> 841.48]  as like,
[841.56 --> 842.82]  an introductory
[842.82 --> 843.44]  promo
[843.44 --> 844.80]  knowing
[844.80 --> 845.54]  that some
[845.54 --> 846.32]  of my inventory
[846.32 --> 847.06]  would
[847.06 --> 848.46]  jump back up
[848.46 --> 849.52]  to a higher price
[849.52 --> 850.38]  after the fact,
[851.12 --> 851.48]  no.
[851.82 --> 852.80]  I have never
[852.80 --> 853.76]  seen that before.
[854.40 --> 855.40]  And I consider
[855.40 --> 856.10]  that to be,
[856.36 --> 857.30]  if that is indeed
[857.30 --> 857.92]  what is happening,
[858.12 --> 858.76]  there is more
[858.76 --> 859.24]  to the story,
[859.32 --> 860.00]  which we'll get to,
[860.24 --> 861.52]  but if that is indeed
[861.52 --> 862.10]  what is happening,
[862.18 --> 863.36]  I consider that to be
[863.36 --> 865.52]  extremely disingenuous
[865.52 --> 866.86]  because that is not
[866.86 --> 868.82]  reflective of what
[868.82 --> 869.54]  the long-term
[869.54 --> 870.82]  situation is going to be.
[870.98 --> 872.12]  That's an introductory
[872.12 --> 872.64]  promo,
[872.84 --> 873.74]  that is not
[873.74 --> 874.88]  an MSRP.
[875.38 --> 875.90]  And if you're not
[875.90 --> 876.44]  enabling,
[876.58 --> 877.46]  and I can tell you,
[877.74 --> 878.06]  again,
[878.16 --> 878.96]  from working in retail
[878.96 --> 879.78]  and knowing that this
[879.78 --> 880.38]  hasn't changed,
[880.60 --> 881.52]  I can tell you that
[881.52 --> 882.72]  the margins are not
[882.72 --> 884.26]  there to support
[884.26 --> 885.32]  selling this thing
[885.32 --> 886.16]  at $599.
[886.48 --> 886.60]  So,
[886.68 --> 887.76]  I'll use the XT
[887.76 --> 888.50]  as my example.
[888.86 --> 889.80]  The margins are not
[889.80 --> 890.94]  there to support
[890.94 --> 892.32]  selling this at $599.
[892.32 --> 894.46]  if you need
[894.46 --> 895.42]  an instant rebate
[895.42 --> 895.90]  to get there,
[895.96 --> 896.56]  you make like
[896.56 --> 897.52]  six points
[897.52 --> 898.90]  on a GPU.
[899.24 --> 899.38]  Like,
[899.44 --> 899.80]  get real
[899.80 --> 900.76]  as a retailer.
[901.36 --> 902.18]  That is unless
[902.18 --> 902.90]  you are,
[903.32 --> 903.60]  well,
[904.22 --> 904.90]  we'll get to the
[904.90 --> 905.72]  whole thing
[905.72 --> 906.32]  where you can
[906.32 --> 907.26]  have marketplaces
[907.26 --> 908.04]  sell the GPU
[908.04 --> 908.62]  and they can be
[908.62 --> 909.22]  at higher prices
[909.22 --> 909.84]  and you take a
[909.84 --> 910.44]  cut of that
[910.44 --> 910.66]  and,
[910.86 --> 910.98]  well,
[911.18 --> 911.70]  I mean,
[911.72 --> 912.28]  it's not my fault.
[912.36 --> 912.92]  I didn't price it
[912.92 --> 913.14]  at that.
[913.20 --> 913.38]  Anyway,
[913.68 --> 914.14]  that's a whole
[914.14 --> 915.22]  other conversation.
[915.40 --> 916.18]  This is very,
[917.06 --> 918.02]  very deep,
[918.34 --> 919.18]  very complicated
[919.18 --> 920.58]  and we're just
[920.58 --> 921.08]  getting started.
[921.08 --> 922.04]  So,
[922.20 --> 922.82]  I would say
[922.82 --> 924.20]  the closest thing
[924.20 --> 925.50]  that I ever saw
[925.50 --> 926.56]  to the kind of
[926.56 --> 927.36]  fervor
[927.36 --> 928.64]  that is going on
[928.64 --> 929.44]  in the GPU market
[929.44 --> 929.90]  right now
[929.90 --> 931.24]  because I worked there
[931.24 --> 932.98]  pre-AI boom,
[933.58 --> 934.76]  pre-crypto boom,
[935.00 --> 935.22]  right?
[936.34 --> 936.98]  I would say
[936.98 --> 938.44]  the 8800 GT
[938.44 --> 940.20]  was the closest
[940.20 --> 941.06]  I ever saw
[941.06 --> 942.02]  and that,
[942.14 --> 943.18]  that was a
[943.18 --> 944.80]  ripping launch.
[945.50 --> 945.72]  Like,
[946.02 --> 947.46]  it basically offered
[947.46 --> 948.08]  similar,
[948.30 --> 948.46]  see,
[948.56 --> 949.22]  he remembers,
[949.88 --> 950.68]  this guy remembers,
[950.68 --> 951.98]  it was a good time.
[952.20 --> 953.26]  Anyone who was there
[953.26 --> 954.92]  for 8800 GT launch
[954.92 --> 955.78]  remembers
[955.78 --> 956.70]  because that thing
[956.70 --> 957.68]  was wild.
[958.10 --> 958.82]  It was based
[958.82 --> 961.12]  on the G92 die,
[961.36 --> 962.84]  if I recall correctly.
[963.08 --> 963.52]  So,
[963.60 --> 964.44]  it was a process
[964.44 --> 965.34]  node shrink
[965.34 --> 967.14]  compared to the G80,
[967.26 --> 969.92]  which was the 8800 GTX.
[970.02 --> 971.52]  That was the top spec card
[971.52 --> 974.28]  and this 8800 GT
[974.28 --> 975.86]  was on this new die
[975.86 --> 977.50]  that was on a new node.
[977.60 --> 979.10]  It was crazy power efficient.
[979.10 --> 981.14]  It clocked crazy well.
[981.26 --> 981.48]  It was,
[981.48 --> 982.26]  it was killer.
[982.62 --> 983.94]  I think it had a little bit
[983.94 --> 985.64]  less RAM or something like that.
[985.68 --> 985.82]  Like,
[985.84 --> 986.92]  it had less VRAM,
[987.06 --> 987.88]  but it was available
[987.88 --> 989.22]  in two different configs,
[989.26 --> 989.74]  one with less
[989.74 --> 990.28]  and one with more
[990.28 --> 991.06]  and you didn't really need
[991.06 --> 991.90]  the extra VRAM
[991.90 --> 993.12]  for a lot of modern games
[993.12 --> 993.60]  at that time.
[993.66 --> 993.76]  So,
[993.82 --> 994.52]  a lot of people went
[994.52 --> 995.34]  with the lower priced,
[995.44 --> 996.32]  lower VRAM one
[996.32 --> 998.10]  and it offered
[998.10 --> 1000.96]  bloody near the same performance,
[1001.20 --> 1002.44]  this 8800 GT,
[1002.72 --> 1003.72]  like non-GTX
[1003.72 --> 1005.08]  and it was like a mid-cycle refresh.
[1005.08 --> 1006.12]  The whole thing was bizarre.
[1006.74 --> 1008.92]  Near 8800 GTX performance
[1008.92 --> 1010.66]  at a fraction of the heat,
[1011.14 --> 1011.46]  therefore,
[1011.62 --> 1013.20]  it was a single slot card
[1013.20 --> 1015.68]  and at like half the price.
[1016.28 --> 1016.54]  Like,
[1016.58 --> 1017.24]  it was wild.
[1017.46 --> 1018.48]  And if you compared it
[1018.48 --> 1020.02]  to the 8800 Ultra,
[1020.52 --> 1022.66]  which was barely better
[1022.66 --> 1023.52]  than a GTX
[1023.52 --> 1024.52]  but cost way more,
[1024.82 --> 1025.94]  the value proposition
[1025.94 --> 1028.02]  was like unheard of.
[1028.12 --> 1028.18]  Like,
[1028.24 --> 1028.44]  people,
[1028.58 --> 1029.04]  and remember,
[1029.42 --> 1031.08]  SLI was a thing back then
[1031.08 --> 1032.82]  and scaled pretty okay
[1032.82 --> 1034.36]  across a lot of games
[1034.36 --> 1035.54]  that people actually played.
[1035.70 --> 1035.88]  So,
[1035.94 --> 1036.44]  people were buying
[1036.44 --> 1037.22]  two of these
[1037.22 --> 1038.66]  for like the price
[1038.66 --> 1040.42]  of a single 8800 GTX
[1040.42 --> 1041.60]  and absolutely
[1041.60 --> 1043.18]  curb stomping
[1043.18 --> 1044.22]  the GTX
[1044.22 --> 1045.12]  in terms of performance.
[1046.02 --> 1047.28]  Nobody could keep
[1047.28 --> 1048.28]  these things in stock.
[1048.36 --> 1049.76]  It was a feeding frenzy.
[1050.54 --> 1051.62]  And what happened
[1051.62 --> 1052.58]  was over time,
[1052.96 --> 1054.12]  the 8800 GT
[1054.12 --> 1055.48]  did go up in price
[1055.48 --> 1057.28]  but it didn't happen
[1057.28 --> 1057.96]  like this.
[1058.20 --> 1059.26]  It didn't happen
[1059.26 --> 1061.84]  that your initial inventory
[1061.84 --> 1063.08]  would come in
[1063.08 --> 1065.18]  and they would basically
[1065.18 --> 1065.94]  have you pay
[1065.94 --> 1066.74]  a higher price
[1066.74 --> 1068.24]  and then instant rebate
[1068.24 --> 1068.76]  you down
[1068.76 --> 1069.70]  so you could sell
[1069.70 --> 1070.40]  a limited amount
[1070.40 --> 1071.28]  of them at a lower price.
[1071.34 --> 1071.42]  No,
[1071.50 --> 1072.74]  you paid the lower price.
[1073.30 --> 1073.68]  And the way
[1073.68 --> 1074.68]  that pricing went up
[1074.68 --> 1075.88]  was that your next shipment
[1075.88 --> 1077.38]  would be at a higher price.
[1077.70 --> 1078.02]  So,
[1078.12 --> 1079.20]  it was up to the retailer
[1079.20 --> 1079.90]  to determine,
[1080.10 --> 1080.74]  you know,
[1080.76 --> 1081.34]  how much they were
[1081.34 --> 1082.08]  going to market up
[1082.08 --> 1082.70]  or whatever
[1082.70 --> 1085.26]  with the manufacturer's
[1085.26 --> 1085.96]  suggestions,
[1086.32 --> 1086.58]  right?
[1086.70 --> 1087.98]  It was up to the retailer
[1087.98 --> 1088.60]  how they were going
[1088.60 --> 1089.20]  to market up
[1089.20 --> 1091.34]  but no one was
[1091.34 --> 1092.28]  kind of exercising
[1092.28 --> 1093.68]  external control
[1093.68 --> 1094.62]  on that card
[1094.62 --> 1095.52]  by having you
[1095.52 --> 1096.52]  pay a higher price
[1096.52 --> 1098.24]  and then enabling
[1098.24 --> 1098.96]  the MSRP
[1098.96 --> 1100.46]  with a SPF
[1100.46 --> 1101.78]  or a discount
[1101.78 --> 1103.28]  or an instant rebate
[1103.28 --> 1104.56]  or a POS rebate
[1104.56 --> 1105.62]  or whatever
[1105.62 --> 1107.22]  these mechanisms are.
[1108.80 --> 1109.40]  So,
[1109.52 --> 1109.74]  no.
[1110.04 --> 1110.86]  In conclusion,
[1111.36 --> 1113.08]  I have never seen
[1113.08 --> 1114.90]  what Andrew Gibson
[1114.90 --> 1117.04]  and the Swedish retailer
[1117.04 --> 1119.32]  are describing.
[1120.32 --> 1120.76]  No,
[1120.96 --> 1121.62]  I have not.
[1123.50 --> 1123.98]  So,
[1124.30 --> 1125.62]  let's hear the other side
[1125.62 --> 1126.10]  of the story.
[1127.14 --> 1128.60]  The Verge asked AMD,
[1129.00 --> 1130.04]  can you confirm
[1130.04 --> 1130.74]  or deny
[1130.74 --> 1132.30]  that the best prices
[1132.30 --> 1134.00]  on the best priced cards
[1134.00 --> 1135.00]  are capped
[1135.00 --> 1135.74]  in this way?
[1136.12 --> 1137.40]  And what AMD said is,
[1137.76 --> 1138.80]  it is inaccurate
[1138.80 --> 1140.32]  that the 549,
[1140.72 --> 1142.22]  599 MSRP
[1142.22 --> 1144.12]  is launch-only pricing.
[1144.12 --> 1145.88]  We expect cards
[1145.88 --> 1146.52]  to be available
[1146.52 --> 1147.88]  from multiple vendors
[1147.88 --> 1149.06]  at 549
[1149.06 --> 1150.18]  slash 599
[1150.18 --> 1152.30]  excluding region-specific
[1152.30 --> 1152.76]  tariffs
[1152.76 --> 1153.60]  and or taxes
[1153.60 --> 1155.04]  based on the work
[1155.04 --> 1155.54]  we have done
[1155.54 --> 1156.68]  with our AIB partners
[1156.68 --> 1158.28]  and more are coming.
[1158.96 --> 1160.22]  At the same time,
[1160.40 --> 1161.10]  the AIBs
[1161.10 --> 1161.68]  have different
[1161.68 --> 1162.84]  premium configurations
[1162.84 --> 1164.08]  at higher price points
[1164.08 --> 1166.24]  and those will also continue.
[1166.54 --> 1166.86]  Now,
[1166.90 --> 1167.62]  that's another thing
[1167.62 --> 1168.32]  that is different
[1168.32 --> 1168.92]  these days.
[1169.26 --> 1170.22]  It used to be
[1170.22 --> 1171.42]  that a premium version,
[1171.42 --> 1172.12]  and I'm going to use
[1172.12 --> 1173.22]  EVGA's lingo,
[1173.46 --> 1173.72]  okay?
[1174.08 --> 1174.30]  So,
[1174.36 --> 1174.82]  a KO
[1174.82 --> 1176.90]  or a SC
[1176.90 --> 1179.00]  or a...
[1179.00 --> 1179.30]  Okay,
[1179.42 --> 1180.42]  a kingpin's a bad example
[1180.42 --> 1180.94]  because those were
[1180.94 --> 1181.92]  a lot more expensive.
[1182.32 --> 1183.10]  But these...
[1183.10 --> 1184.16]  these...
[1184.16 --> 1185.56]  these premium versions
[1185.56 --> 1186.12]  of a card
[1186.12 --> 1187.48]  usually
[1187.48 --> 1190.66]  didn't encroach
[1190.66 --> 1192.26]  or barely encroached
[1192.26 --> 1193.20]  on the pricing
[1193.20 --> 1194.22]  of the card above them.
[1194.64 --> 1195.02]  Nowadays,
[1195.38 --> 1195.66]  dude,
[1196.02 --> 1196.78]  it feels like
[1196.78 --> 1197.40]  you can see
[1197.40 --> 1199.16]  like an overbuilt card,
[1199.26 --> 1199.80]  like a premium
[1199.80 --> 1201.06]  or an overclocked version
[1201.06 --> 1201.66]  of a card
[1201.66 --> 1203.42]  that literally costs
[1203.42 --> 1205.22]  like 30% more.
[1206.02 --> 1206.96]  And you're looking at it
[1206.96 --> 1207.28]  going like,
[1207.36 --> 1207.42]  well,
[1207.42 --> 1207.50]  well,
[1207.50 --> 1207.68]  well,
[1207.68 --> 1207.76]  well,
[1207.76 --> 1208.16]  hold on.
[1208.72 --> 1209.64]  Shouldn't I just be getting
[1209.64 --> 1210.52]  like a completely new
[1210.52 --> 1211.70]  class of GPU for this?
[1211.74 --> 1212.48]  This is ridiculous.
[1213.00 --> 1214.84]  But because the price bands
[1214.84 --> 1217.86]  have been so stretched out,
[1217.90 --> 1219.26]  like they used to have to fit
[1219.26 --> 1221.78]  like your 30 class GPU,
[1221.94 --> 1222.40]  your 50,
[1222.48 --> 1223.22]  your 50 Ti,
[1223.36 --> 1223.88]  your 60,
[1224.02 --> 1224.80]  your 60 Ti,
[1224.94 --> 1225.46]  your 70,
[1225.72 --> 1225.96]  your,
[1226.08 --> 1226.64]  you know,
[1226.72 --> 1227.30]  your 80,
[1227.64 --> 1228.70]  your 90,
[1228.70 --> 1229.96]  your Titan,
[1230.16 --> 1232.90]  but all of that fit within a,
[1233.14 --> 1233.40]  you know,
[1233.44 --> 1235.44]  about 200 to 800,
[1235.72 --> 1236.54]  a thousand dollars,
[1236.64 --> 1236.88]  right?
[1237.64 --> 1237.88]  Well,
[1237.90 --> 1238.20]  now,
[1238.32 --> 1238.50]  well,
[1238.60 --> 1238.84]  I don't know,
[1238.90 --> 1239.76]  we've got price bands
[1239.76 --> 1241.44]  all the way from like 400 bucks
[1241.44 --> 1243.38]  all the way to $2,000.
[1244.44 --> 1244.84]  So,
[1245.38 --> 1246.06]  all of a sudden,
[1246.84 --> 1247.54]  you can have a card
[1247.54 --> 1248.60]  that's supposed to be $400,
[1249.14 --> 1250.46]  you have an overbuilt version of it
[1250.46 --> 1251.92]  that's 550 or $600,
[1252.48 --> 1253.84]  and you're still like 50,
[1254.16 --> 1255.22]  100 bucks below
[1255.22 --> 1256.58]  the next up card.
[1256.66 --> 1257.16]  It's ridiculous.
[1257.16 --> 1258.72]  So,
[1258.84 --> 1259.28]  it's really,
[1259.36 --> 1260.36]  it's really hard
[1260.36 --> 1262.50]  to put downward pressure
[1262.50 --> 1264.52]  on the pricing of a 50,
[1264.70 --> 1265.10]  70,
[1265.54 --> 1266.18]  when 50,
[1266.24 --> 1267.10]  70 Ti's
[1267.10 --> 1268.98]  are so much more expensive
[1268.98 --> 1270.50]  that jumping up to it
[1270.50 --> 1271.76]  isn't just a logical step.
[1274.34 --> 1275.80]  All right.
[1276.32 --> 1277.38]  What else do we have here?
[1278.82 --> 1280.00]  It's a long topic,
[1280.22 --> 1282.04]  and that tangent took so long,
[1282.16 --> 1284.12]  and it's still such a long topic.
[1284.42 --> 1284.56]  Well,
[1284.60 --> 1284.74]  dude,
[1284.82 --> 1285.02]  I mean,
[1285.04 --> 1285.62]  is it interesting?
[1285.62 --> 1287.16]  Because you guys can tell me if you're bored
[1287.16 --> 1288.06]  and we can move on.
[1288.38 --> 1289.46]  People seem pretty engaged.
[1289.58 --> 1289.82]  Okay.
[1290.38 --> 1293.18]  Many folks have cried foul on AMD,
[1293.54 --> 1295.28]  claiming they are doing evil deeds.
[1296.66 --> 1299.38]  Adam's guess is that it's mostly incompetence.
[1300.22 --> 1300.50]  I mean,
[1300.56 --> 1300.88]  of course,
[1300.98 --> 1302.48]  companies are trying to maximize profits.
[1302.56 --> 1303.72]  That's what they exist to do.
[1304.12 --> 1304.88]  But AMD doesn't,
[1304.96 --> 1306.04]  AMD doesn't sell GPUs
[1306.04 --> 1307.34]  out of the goodness of their hearts.
[1307.70 --> 1309.32]  But there does seem to be
[1309.32 --> 1310.58]  some incompetence,
[1310.58 --> 1313.96]  but also maybe some strategic incompetence
[1313.96 --> 1316.30]  because I had another email hit my inbox
[1316.30 --> 1318.94]  that Adam didn't have access to
[1318.94 --> 1320.88]  that will add a little bit more context
[1320.88 --> 1322.24]  to what I'm about to say.
[1322.78 --> 1323.84]  So strap in.
[1325.54 --> 1327.34]  The pricing was last minute.
[1328.02 --> 1329.12]  Hardware Unboxed noted
[1329.12 --> 1331.32]  in their 9000 series announcement video
[1331.32 --> 1333.62]  that they had prepared multiple conclusions
[1333.62 --> 1334.58]  to the announcement
[1334.58 --> 1336.72]  because AMD hadn't determined pricing yet.
[1336.92 --> 1337.82]  And we did the same thing.
[1337.82 --> 1340.44]  We prepared three different conclusions for our video
[1340.44 --> 1342.74]  depending on the announced pricing from AMD.
[1344.22 --> 1346.66]  That means that this information
[1346.66 --> 1349.10]  was likely provided last minute
[1349.10 --> 1351.74]  to retailers and even board partners
[1351.74 --> 1354.00]  who would have needed to prepare promotional materials,
[1354.16 --> 1355.30]  social media posts, signage,
[1355.74 --> 1357.32]  advertising, database entries,
[1357.42 --> 1359.94]  and more in an extremely short period of time.
[1360.72 --> 1361.86]  AMD would have had to communicate
[1361.86 --> 1364.22]  to all of their retail and manufacturing partners,
[1364.56 --> 1365.62]  provide compensation
[1365.62 --> 1367.28]  if prices were being adjusted
[1367.28 --> 1369.04]  in the form of rebates or payments.
[1369.38 --> 1370.64]  Board partners would have had to reprice
[1370.64 --> 1371.20]  all their products,
[1371.32 --> 1373.28]  communicate to retailers and SIs and the like.
[1373.66 --> 1374.46]  And this scramble
[1374.46 --> 1376.90]  leaves a lot of room for errors
[1376.90 --> 1379.56]  like Best Buy listing the MSRP cards
[1379.56 --> 1381.18]  as on sale at launch time.
[1381.66 --> 1382.74]  AMD has since confirmed
[1382.74 --> 1384.44]  this was an error on Best Buy's part
[1384.44 --> 1386.22]  because the availability date
[1386.22 --> 1388.26]  was supposed to be a day after.
[1388.82 --> 1389.66]  Whoopsie doodles.
[1390.56 --> 1392.66]  Board partners also deal with razor thin margins
[1392.66 --> 1393.64]  and have a big interest
[1393.64 --> 1395.18]  in making as much money as possible
[1395.18 --> 1396.42]  from pent up demand.
[1396.42 --> 1398.56]  So the question is,
[1398.64 --> 1399.90]  what can AMD do about this?
[1400.02 --> 1401.48]  And Adam's conclusion is,
[1401.58 --> 1402.80]  I mean, not much.
[1403.30 --> 1404.52]  Frank Azor from AMD
[1404.52 --> 1407.02]  says they will be encouraging AIBs
[1407.02 --> 1408.08]  to keep cards at MSRP.
[1409.08 --> 1410.42]  And we spoke...
[1410.42 --> 1418.30]  And I think that's a little bit disingenuous,
[1418.44 --> 1418.84]  personally,
[1418.84 --> 1420.94]  because I do believe that AMD
[1420.94 --> 1424.12]  can do more than just suggest things.
[1424.52 --> 1426.22]  Here's an example of something
[1426.22 --> 1427.52]  that AMD could do,
[1427.90 --> 1429.54]  is if board partners
[1429.54 --> 1431.42]  are not allocating enough of their cards
[1431.42 --> 1433.26]  to MSRP versions,
[1433.50 --> 1435.54]  they could not allocate them GPUs.
[1435.54 --> 1438.10]  That is literally the lever.
[1438.36 --> 1440.84]  That is the way that GPU makers,
[1441.14 --> 1442.42]  and this drives me crazy
[1442.42 --> 1445.86]  because I can be kind of pedantic sometimes,
[1446.04 --> 1446.90]  and this is a distinction
[1446.90 --> 1448.62]  that actually does matter,
[1448.76 --> 1449.36]  in my opinion.
[1449.90 --> 1452.16]  GPU makers are named
[1452.16 --> 1454.40]  Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA.
[1455.38 --> 1456.38]  Graphics board,
[1456.64 --> 1457.48]  or video card,
[1457.60 --> 1458.66]  or graphics card,
[1459.00 --> 1460.14]  or add-in board,
[1460.36 --> 1461.18]  board partners,
[1461.18 --> 1463.86]  those are the Sapphires,
[1464.26 --> 1465.70]  Asuses, MSIs,
[1465.94 --> 1467.44]  power colors of the world.
[1467.70 --> 1467.84]  Okay?
[1468.34 --> 1469.74]  So, that's not a GPU.
[1470.02 --> 1470.88]  That's a graphics card.
[1471.56 --> 1473.56]  A GPU is the actual silicon die.
[1473.96 --> 1475.58]  So, that's the leverage
[1475.58 --> 1477.92]  that GPU makers traditionally have
[1477.92 --> 1479.50]  over their board partners,
[1479.68 --> 1481.50]  over the graphics card makers,
[1481.70 --> 1483.10]  is that they can basically say,
[1483.20 --> 1484.92]  look, play by our rules,
[1485.46 --> 1488.46]  or you will either sell at the price
[1488.46 --> 1489.28]  that we dictate,
[1489.58 --> 1490.52]  or you will sell nothing.
[1491.18 --> 1493.76]  Now, there's a problem with that.
[1494.26 --> 1495.44]  The problem with that
[1495.44 --> 1497.84]  is that then they are exerting
[1497.84 --> 1500.60]  a kind of ridiculous level of control
[1500.60 --> 1502.78]  over their, you know, partners,
[1502.98 --> 1504.86]  and really not treating them very well,
[1505.26 --> 1506.62]  especially if they don't give them
[1506.62 --> 1507.74]  enough margin to survive.
[1508.22 --> 1510.38]  See Exhibit A, EVGA,
[1511.08 --> 1512.50]  who didn't survive
[1512.50 --> 1514.36]  in the graphics card market
[1514.36 --> 1515.44]  because they simply,
[1516.24 --> 1518.04]  and this is a little bit of conjecture
[1518.04 --> 1518.52]  on my part,
[1518.82 --> 1520.18]  but simply got squeezed out.
[1520.18 --> 1521.98]  There was just not enough margin
[1521.98 --> 1523.54]  for them to continue to make it.
[1523.54 --> 1528.88]  Now, here's where the story gets a little bit,
[1529.10 --> 1531.32]  where we get a little bit more color commentary
[1531.32 --> 1531.90]  on the story.
[1532.04 --> 1533.70]  We spoke with a system integrator
[1533.70 --> 1535.92]  who had a bit of a different,
[1536.76 --> 1537.94]  and I wouldn't say different take,
[1538.06 --> 1540.36]  but a more expanded upon take.
[1540.62 --> 1542.28]  Their take was basically that
[1542.28 --> 1543.82]  all AMD really cares about
[1543.82 --> 1545.08]  to call this launch a success
[1545.08 --> 1547.10]  is to see big lineups at Micro Center.
[1547.10 --> 1549.66]  And we did see some evidence
[1549.66 --> 1553.82]  that Micro Center got a huge allocation
[1553.82 --> 1555.82]  compared to what was available online.
[1556.10 --> 1557.32]  I don't know this for sure,
[1557.78 --> 1560.40]  but it does seem like retail.
[1560.90 --> 1562.02]  I feel like we're,
[1562.26 --> 1564.04]  I feel like we've gone back two decades.
[1564.50 --> 1566.70]  It does seem like retail
[1566.70 --> 1569.40]  got the priority for the launch
[1569.40 --> 1571.28]  compared to e-tail,
[1571.42 --> 1572.56]  compared to online,
[1572.56 --> 1574.54]  which, again,
[1574.66 --> 1575.70]  you want to talk about things
[1575.70 --> 1576.82]  that I don't remember seeing
[1576.82 --> 1577.98]  in my entire career.
[1578.66 --> 1579.90]  Well, that's one of them.
[1580.74 --> 1581.88]  That's wild, dude,
[1582.08 --> 1583.82]  that the way to get these products
[1583.82 --> 1584.44]  on launch day
[1584.44 --> 1584.94]  is that you have,
[1585.04 --> 1586.68]  you like go line up
[1586.68 --> 1588.58]  and buy something in person.
[1591.28 --> 1593.08]  So they were pretty frustrated.
[1593.32 --> 1594.70]  Their total allocation
[1594.70 --> 1596.84]  of 9070 XTs
[1596.84 --> 1598.30]  from one board partner
[1598.30 --> 1599.36]  that they were able to use
[1599.36 --> 1600.04]  in their systems
[1600.04 --> 1601.34]  was three units.
[1601.98 --> 1602.76]  Those units,
[1603.38 --> 1605.74]  their cost was over MSRP.
[1606.76 --> 1608.66]  So what that tells me,
[1608.88 --> 1610.82]  what that tells me
[1610.82 --> 1613.52]  is that we are not getting
[1613.52 --> 1614.74]  the whole story from AMD
[1614.74 --> 1616.38]  because it's very clear
[1616.38 --> 1618.04]  from those retailers telling us,
[1618.14 --> 1620.10]  hey, we only have pricing support
[1620.10 --> 1621.58]  on a limited number of these cards.
[1621.92 --> 1623.98]  And AMD never actually said
[1623.98 --> 1627.04]  that the everyday MSRP will be,
[1627.70 --> 1628.78]  or the everyday price
[1628.78 --> 1630.66]  on these cards will be $549, $599.
[1631.00 --> 1631.90]  All they said is that
[1631.90 --> 1632.90]  they'll continue to be available.
[1633.46 --> 1633.98]  They didn't say
[1633.98 --> 1635.72]  in what kinds of quantities, right?
[1636.08 --> 1637.42]  So what that tells us
[1637.42 --> 1638.62]  is that it takes
[1638.62 --> 1640.24]  some kind of SPF
[1640.24 --> 1641.78]  or POS rebate
[1641.78 --> 1642.84]  or something
[1642.84 --> 1644.40]  in order to hit these prices.
[1644.82 --> 1647.12]  These are not everyday prices
[1647.12 --> 1648.52]  because if they were,
[1648.88 --> 1649.60]  then an SI
[1649.60 --> 1651.90]  would be able to buy a card
[1651.90 --> 1654.16]  at $570
[1654.16 --> 1656.86]  and make a few points of margin
[1656.86 --> 1658.10]  selling it at $599.
[1658.10 --> 1659.98]  That would be possible.
[1660.98 --> 1662.60]  But what tends to happen
[1662.60 --> 1664.38]  when your pricing is controlled
[1664.38 --> 1665.14]  via SPF
[1665.14 --> 1666.76]  or via instant rebate
[1666.76 --> 1668.90]  is that only the large players
[1668.90 --> 1670.10]  will have access to that.
[1670.52 --> 1671.58]  And so when you go buy something
[1671.58 --> 1672.60]  at a mom and pop shop
[1672.60 --> 1674.22]  or from a small system integrator,
[1674.38 --> 1676.16]  it'll be at a much higher price
[1676.16 --> 1677.40]  because they don't have access
[1677.40 --> 1678.06]  to any of that.
[1678.26 --> 1679.72]  They just buy from a distributor
[1679.72 --> 1681.30]  and the price is
[1681.30 --> 1683.00]  whatever the channel price is,
[1683.28 --> 1684.26]  whatever the market will bear.
[1684.26 --> 1686.64]  Another element
[1686.64 --> 1688.42]  that they brought up with us
[1688.42 --> 1690.46]  is that curiously,
[1690.72 --> 1692.42]  a lot...
[1692.42 --> 1692.58]  Sorry, one sec.
[1694.36 --> 1696.54]  HoverShip said his 9070XT
[1696.54 --> 1698.34]  from Micro Center
[1698.34 --> 1699.08]  was $1,100.
[1700.84 --> 1702.62]  Yeah, that doesn't surprise you.
[1703.58 --> 1704.10]  Okay.
[1704.30 --> 1705.48]  How do I say this
[1705.48 --> 1706.48]  in a nice way?
[1706.58 --> 1707.20]  He said $789.
[1707.48 --> 1707.62]  What?
[1708.22 --> 1708.68]  Oh, okay.
[1709.20 --> 1709.50]  Okay.
[1709.64 --> 1710.26]  He said $1,100
[1710.26 --> 1711.18]  and then he said $789.
[1711.40 --> 1711.60]  Okay.
[1712.00 --> 1712.80]  Okay, $789.
[1713.24 --> 1713.54]  Okay.
[1713.72 --> 1715.10]  That actually ties really well
[1715.10 --> 1716.30]  into the next point.
[1716.88 --> 1718.14]  This SI contact
[1718.14 --> 1719.18]  who we're not going to name
[1719.18 --> 1720.02]  just because we don't want them
[1720.02 --> 1720.58]  to get in trouble
[1720.58 --> 1722.44]  for giving us this inside baseball.
[1723.24 --> 1724.28]  This SI contact
[1724.28 --> 1725.02]  pointed out
[1725.02 --> 1726.30]  that it's curious
[1726.30 --> 1728.46]  that a lot of the cards
[1728.46 --> 1730.32]  have ended up kind of
[1730.32 --> 1731.88]  for the 70...
[1731.88 --> 1733.06]  For the 9070XT
[1733.06 --> 1734.64]  have ended up in the
[1734.64 --> 1737.06]  kind of $720 range
[1737.06 --> 1738.48]  kind of plus
[1738.48 --> 1739.96]  depending on how overbuilt
[1739.96 --> 1740.38]  they are.
[1741.12 --> 1741.46]  Well,
[1742.04 --> 1743.18]  here's something to consider.
[1744.10 --> 1744.66]  $599
[1744.66 --> 1747.48]  plus a 20% tariff
[1747.48 --> 1748.36]  equals what?
[1751.98 --> 1752.58]  $720.
[1754.90 --> 1755.54]  Gotcha.
[1755.90 --> 1756.96]  And here's the thing.
[1757.52 --> 1758.30]  Here's the thing.
[1758.82 --> 1760.04]  When NVIDIA
[1760.04 --> 1761.24]  launched their
[1761.24 --> 1762.48]  newest generation cards,
[1762.90 --> 1763.80]  they didn't know
[1763.80 --> 1765.02]  what the tariffs would be.
[1765.44 --> 1766.54]  There is at least
[1766.54 --> 1768.56]  an argument to be made
[1768.56 --> 1769.58]  that NVIDIA
[1769.58 --> 1770.90]  did not know
[1770.90 --> 1771.98]  that there would be tariffs
[1771.98 --> 1772.72]  on their cards
[1772.72 --> 1773.60]  impacting the pricing
[1773.60 --> 1774.42]  and don't kid yourself.
[1775.02 --> 1775.76]  There are tariffs
[1775.76 --> 1776.82]  and they are impacting
[1776.82 --> 1777.38]  the pricing.
[1778.36 --> 1778.78]  AMD
[1778.78 --> 1780.04]  knew.
[1781.52 --> 1782.58]  Before AMD
[1782.58 --> 1783.26]  announced
[1783.26 --> 1784.26]  their retail
[1784.26 --> 1785.36]  MSRP,
[1786.14 --> 1786.88]  they knew
[1786.88 --> 1787.58]  that there would be
[1787.58 --> 1788.44]  20% tariffs
[1788.44 --> 1789.28]  on these cards
[1789.28 --> 1790.00]  if they were shipping
[1790.00 --> 1790.56]  out of China.
[1791.02 --> 1792.36]  And many, many of them
[1792.36 --> 1793.62]  are manufactured there.
[1793.62 --> 1795.88]  So, what it appears
[1795.88 --> 1796.72]  to me,
[1797.02 --> 1798.36]  and I can't say this
[1798.36 --> 1798.96]  for certain,
[1799.30 --> 1800.52]  but with all of the evidence
[1800.52 --> 1801.22]  that I've seen
[1801.22 --> 1802.62]  and with all of the experience
[1802.62 --> 1803.24]  that I have,
[1803.56 --> 1804.84]  what it appears to me
[1804.84 --> 1805.88]  is happening here
[1805.88 --> 1807.06]  is AMD
[1807.06 --> 1808.64]  wanted to undercut
[1808.64 --> 1809.08]  NVIDIA
[1809.08 --> 1810.12]  on their MSRP,
[1811.06 --> 1812.50]  is selling these cards
[1812.50 --> 1813.38]  into the market
[1813.38 --> 1815.02]  with 20% tariffs
[1815.02 --> 1815.48]  on them,
[1816.36 --> 1817.32]  knowing that
[1817.32 --> 1818.48]  realistically
[1818.48 --> 1820.12]  their partners
[1820.12 --> 1821.00]  will not
[1821.00 --> 1822.04]  be able to hit
[1822.04 --> 1822.80]  those prices
[1822.80 --> 1823.58]  across
[1823.58 --> 1824.98]  the entire
[1824.98 --> 1826.40]  inventory that they have,
[1826.56 --> 1827.50]  but that they could
[1827.50 --> 1828.20]  strategically
[1828.20 --> 1829.18]  trickle out
[1829.18 --> 1829.66]  a few of them
[1829.66 --> 1830.40]  at that price
[1830.40 --> 1831.92]  while selling the rest
[1831.92 --> 1833.88]  at a much higher price
[1833.88 --> 1835.02]  that reflects the tariffs,
[1835.32 --> 1836.34]  which they expect
[1836.34 --> 1837.58]  customers to simply
[1837.58 --> 1838.30]  accept
[1838.30 --> 1839.12]  and absorb
[1839.12 --> 1840.46]  because
[1840.46 --> 1841.44]  GPU prices
[1841.44 --> 1842.66]  are so high
[1842.66 --> 1843.34]  in the market.
[1844.02 --> 1845.76]  It appears to me
[1845.76 --> 1846.66]  that AMD
[1846.66 --> 1848.50]  has no real intention
[1848.50 --> 1849.78]  of actually hitting
[1849.78 --> 1850.40]  those prices,
[1850.40 --> 1852.08]  but it may not
[1852.08 --> 1852.64]  be entirely
[1852.64 --> 1853.28]  their fault
[1853.28 --> 1854.58]  because AMD
[1854.58 --> 1855.66]  certainly didn't
[1855.66 --> 1856.48]  start a trade war.
[1858.04 --> 1858.56]  Question.
[1858.90 --> 1860.32]  I don't think
[1860.32 --> 1861.32]  while you were
[1861.32 --> 1862.30]  working at NCX
[1862.30 --> 1863.06]  there was
[1863.06 --> 1864.50]  noticeable tariffs,
[1864.86 --> 1865.90]  but do you
[1865.90 --> 1866.48]  know anyone
[1866.48 --> 1867.34]  or have any experience
[1867.34 --> 1867.94]  with stores
[1867.94 --> 1869.00]  that operate
[1869.00 --> 1869.28]  during,
[1869.40 --> 1869.56]  like,
[1869.80 --> 1870.60]  I haven't seen
[1870.60 --> 1871.42]  this so far,
[1871.56 --> 1872.08]  but would it be
[1872.08 --> 1873.36]  normal to display
[1873.36 --> 1874.64]  that, like,
[1874.84 --> 1876.12]  this is the base price
[1876.12 --> 1877.08]  and then it increases
[1877.08 --> 1877.64]  by this much
[1877.64 --> 1878.60]  because of the tariff?
[1878.68 --> 1879.40]  Like, would you explain
[1879.40 --> 1880.68]  that to the user?
[1880.80 --> 1881.56]  What would normally
[1881.56 --> 1882.66]  happen is
[1882.66 --> 1883.30]  if you were
[1883.30 --> 1884.70]  a Canadian store,
[1884.86 --> 1885.20]  let's say,
[1885.28 --> 1885.74]  or actually,
[1885.88 --> 1886.86]  let's use a Chinese
[1886.86 --> 1888.38]  store as a better
[1888.38 --> 1888.78]  example.
[1889.18 --> 1890.18]  If you were a Chinese
[1890.18 --> 1890.58]  store,
[1890.66 --> 1891.68]  and by Chinese store,
[1891.76 --> 1892.40]  I don't mean
[1892.40 --> 1893.54]  AliExpress.com.
[1893.90 --> 1895.04]  That's very much
[1895.04 --> 1896.56]  owned by Alibaba
[1896.56 --> 1897.32]  Group or whatever,
[1897.48 --> 1897.62]  right?
[1897.68 --> 1897.98]  But, like,
[1898.00 --> 1898.68]  it's very much
[1898.68 --> 1899.52]  a Chinese store,
[1899.66 --> 1900.42]  but it is,
[1900.56 --> 1901.30]  it has an English
[1901.30 --> 1901.90]  storefront.
[1902.48 --> 1903.16]  Like, it is a,
[1903.20 --> 1903.76]  it is a,
[1903.76 --> 1904.14]  you know,
[1904.20 --> 1905.66]  Western storefront
[1905.66 --> 1906.84]  for a Chinese company.
[1907.28 --> 1907.56]  So,
[1907.68 --> 1908.32]  when I say
[1908.32 --> 1909.10]  Chinese store,
[1909.10 --> 1910.02]  I'm talking like
[1910.02 --> 1910.72]  Taobao,
[1911.08 --> 1911.74]  like an actual,
[1911.88 --> 1912.10]  like,
[1912.22 --> 1913.18]  four Chinese people
[1913.18 --> 1913.80]  in China,
[1914.18 --> 1914.88]  Chinese store.
[1915.22 --> 1915.66]  So,
[1915.82 --> 1916.62]  the way that I would
[1916.62 --> 1917.92]  expect them to
[1917.92 --> 1919.52]  handle it is if you
[1919.52 --> 1920.46]  are ordering from a
[1920.46 --> 1921.20]  tariffed country,
[1921.68 --> 1922.78]  they would either have
[1922.78 --> 1923.78]  some kind of disclaimer
[1923.78 --> 1925.06]  that there may be,
[1925.22 --> 1925.72]  that they're not
[1925.72 --> 1926.78]  responsible for any
[1926.78 --> 1928.06]  import duties,
[1928.24 --> 1928.56]  tariffs,
[1928.68 --> 1928.90]  whatever,
[1929.04 --> 1929.64]  and then you would be
[1929.64 --> 1930.44]  slapped with a tariff
[1930.44 --> 1931.46]  bill when it arrives.
[1931.98 --> 1932.54]  When it arrives,
[1932.60 --> 1932.70]  yeah.
[1932.72 --> 1933.36]  So, that's how I would
[1933.36 --> 1934.18]  expect that to happen.
[1934.18 --> 1935.80]  If you are a retailer
[1935.80 --> 1936.70]  and you are buying
[1936.70 --> 1938.64]  in bulk from a tariffed
[1938.64 --> 1939.12]  source,
[1939.64 --> 1940.66]  then I would expect
[1940.66 --> 1941.44]  that to simply be
[1941.44 --> 1942.52]  bundled into your cost
[1942.52 --> 1943.20]  the same way that
[1943.20 --> 1944.24]  anything else would be,
[1944.38 --> 1945.48]  whether it's freight
[1945.48 --> 1946.92]  or, you know,
[1947.08 --> 1948.06]  transaction fees
[1948.06 --> 1949.72]  or whatever else.
[1949.76 --> 1949.90]  Like,
[1949.90 --> 1950.80]  when we were at NCIX,
[1951.40 --> 1952.68]  you would have kind of,
[1952.78 --> 1953.52]  we had kind of like
[1953.52 --> 1954.20]  a cheat sheet
[1954.20 --> 1955.24]  for what the rough
[1955.24 --> 1956.02]  costs would be.
[1956.10 --> 1956.22]  So,
[1956.26 --> 1956.78]  on something like
[1956.78 --> 1957.60]  a power supply,
[1958.04 --> 1959.88]  I could basically say
[1959.88 --> 1960.82]  as long as I'm ordering
[1960.82 --> 1962.26]  in pallet quantities
[1962.26 --> 1964.10]  and not in just
[1964.10 --> 1964.96]  box quantities,
[1965.44 --> 1966.06]  somewhere in the
[1966.06 --> 1967.04]  neighborhood of around,
[1967.34 --> 1968.20]  over the time that I was
[1968.20 --> 1968.36]  there,
[1968.44 --> 1969.72]  freight costs went up a lot.
[1969.82 --> 1970.78]  So, it started at around
[1970.78 --> 1971.92]  $1, $1.50
[1971.92 --> 1973.48]  and then went up
[1973.48 --> 1974.52]  to probably around
[1974.52 --> 1977.00]  $2 to $2.50
[1977.00 --> 1978.14]  per power supply
[1978.14 --> 1979.30]  in terms of factoring
[1979.30 --> 1980.12]  in your freight cost.
[1980.48 --> 1981.42]  So, you would just
[1981.42 --> 1982.46]  account for that
[1982.46 --> 1984.18]  import tariff
[1984.18 --> 1985.52]  as part of your
[1985.52 --> 1987.36]  import cost of the item
[1987.36 --> 1987.82]  and then you would
[1987.82 --> 1988.56]  mark up from there.
[1989.00 --> 1989.46]  And that would be
[1989.46 --> 1990.46]  transparent to the customer
[1990.46 --> 1991.40]  other than just that
[1991.40 --> 1992.74]  the prices suck.
[1994.74 --> 1995.22]  Okay.
[1996.72 --> 1997.40]  Fair enough.
[1998.28 --> 1999.50]  So, in summary,
[2000.46 --> 2003.02]  I don't think
[2003.02 --> 2004.74]  that AMD
[2004.74 --> 2008.22]  had any intention
[2008.22 --> 2009.58]  of these cards
[2009.58 --> 2011.34]  being universally
[2011.34 --> 2012.54]  available at these prices.
[2013.92 --> 2015.10]  Or, if they did
[2015.10 --> 2015.84]  have an intention,
[2016.42 --> 2017.42]  I think that
[2017.42 --> 2018.44]  it might have been
[2018.44 --> 2019.12]  kind of a
[2019.12 --> 2020.56]  a misguided hope.
[2021.10 --> 2021.84]  Or, I mean,
[2021.94 --> 2022.92]  things have gone
[2022.92 --> 2023.74]  kind of ping pong
[2023.74 --> 2024.64]  back and forth
[2024.64 --> 2025.56]  on the whole tariff thing
[2025.56 --> 2026.06]  a fair bit.
[2026.32 --> 2027.02]  So, maybe it was
[2027.02 --> 2028.26]  a naive hope then
[2028.26 --> 2029.92]  that the tariffs
[2029.92 --> 2030.92]  would not be there
[2030.92 --> 2031.56]  and that they would
[2031.56 --> 2032.42]  be able to hit them.
[2032.68 --> 2033.94]  But as it is now...
[2033.94 --> 2035.14]  I don't think they did
[2035.14 --> 2035.62]  on China.
[2035.90 --> 2036.44]  I think they did
[2036.44 --> 2037.44]  on Canada and Mexico.
[2038.24 --> 2039.16]  Oh, actually,
[2039.44 --> 2039.90]  yeah, I know.
[2039.96 --> 2040.36]  That's right.
[2041.06 --> 2042.30]  So, as it is now,
[2042.76 --> 2043.60]  I think that
[2043.60 --> 2044.12]  the more...
[2044.12 --> 2045.50]  I think the more
[2045.50 --> 2046.54]  transparent thing
[2046.54 --> 2048.18]  for AMD to do
[2048.18 --> 2049.18]  would be to say
[2049.18 --> 2050.68]  there are
[2050.68 --> 2051.86]  outside factors
[2051.86 --> 2053.10]  impacting our costs.
[2053.46 --> 2054.36]  We are going to do
[2054.36 --> 2054.92]  our best
[2054.92 --> 2055.82]  to make sure
[2055.82 --> 2056.58]  that there are cards
[2056.58 --> 2057.40]  available at these
[2057.40 --> 2058.14]  MSRPs.
[2059.18 --> 2059.66]  However,
[2059.94 --> 2061.00]  it is very clear
[2061.00 --> 2061.70]  from these
[2061.70 --> 2062.70]  external factors
[2062.70 --> 2063.50]  that are impacting
[2063.50 --> 2064.22]  our costs
[2064.22 --> 2065.68]  to import these cards
[2065.68 --> 2068.24]  that not every card
[2068.24 --> 2068.84]  will be available
[2068.84 --> 2069.62]  at these prices
[2069.62 --> 2071.16]  and we are effectively
[2071.16 --> 2072.82]  going to be
[2072.82 --> 2075.66]  shifting margin
[2075.66 --> 2076.76]  from the buckets
[2076.76 --> 2077.58]  on the cards
[2077.58 --> 2079.36]  where we're making money
[2079.36 --> 2080.72]  down to these
[2080.72 --> 2082.84]  deeply discounted ones
[2082.84 --> 2084.08]  at MSRP.
[2084.50 --> 2087.32]  MSRP is a discounted price.
[2087.48 --> 2088.64]  It's a promotional price
[2088.64 --> 2090.14]  as far as I can tell.
[2090.70 --> 2091.96]  And I am...
[2091.96 --> 2093.26]  I am deeply...
[2093.26 --> 2094.26]  I'm disappointed.
[2095.50 --> 2096.24]  Scott was about to say
[2096.24 --> 2097.32]  I'm deeply discounted.
[2097.32 --> 2099.32]  Um...
[2100.32 --> 2102.58]  Yeah.
[2103.44 --> 2104.14]  Speaking of you
[2104.14 --> 2105.22]  being deeply discounted
[2105.22 --> 2106.40]  you can take off the hat.
[2106.72 --> 2107.48]  Oh yeah, thanks.
[2108.38 --> 2108.72]  No worries.
[2113.62 --> 2114.34]  There we go.
[2114.60 --> 2115.94]  That is much more comfortable.
[2117.08 --> 2118.06]  Headphones over top
[2118.06 --> 2118.58]  of a toque
[2118.58 --> 2119.54]  is not my vibe.
[2120.42 --> 2120.86]  Yeah.
[2123.38 --> 2124.32]  Is there anything else?
[2124.32 --> 2124.64]  Discussion questions
[2124.64 --> 2125.30]  or next topic?
[2125.30 --> 2126.10]  Are people bored
[2126.10 --> 2126.84]  of this conversation?
[2127.32 --> 2128.26]  I can't tell
[2128.26 --> 2129.34]  if they were into it
[2129.34 --> 2129.56]  or not
[2129.56 --> 2130.34]  because I don't have
[2130.34 --> 2131.20]  all my chats open.
[2133.58 --> 2134.36]  Yeah, it seems like
[2134.36 --> 2135.10]  people are all right with it.
[2135.54 --> 2136.24]  So, yeah.
[2137.02 --> 2137.94]  Good luck, everybody.
[2139.42 --> 2140.42]  The discussion questions
[2140.42 --> 2141.04]  are pretty good.
[2142.14 --> 2143.00]  What is the source
[2143.00 --> 2143.94]  of the supply shortage?
[2144.14 --> 2145.30]  How are board partners feeling?
[2145.74 --> 2146.34]  I'm sure they would
[2146.34 --> 2147.08]  much rather be selling
[2147.08 --> 2148.06]  more GPUs.
[2148.16 --> 2148.52]  I mean...
[2148.52 --> 2148.96]  And then,
[2149.12 --> 2149.94]  do you think NVIDIA
[2149.94 --> 2150.84]  and AMD are indulging
[2150.84 --> 2151.90]  in scarcity marketing?
[2152.04 --> 2152.24]  No.
[2152.66 --> 2153.26]  Well...
[2153.26 --> 2153.88]  I don't think so.
[2153.96 --> 2155.00]  No, I don't think marketing
[2155.00 --> 2156.02]  is the primary driver.
[2156.02 --> 2156.94]  I think with AMD,
[2157.76 --> 2158.60]  I mean,
[2158.70 --> 2159.90]  their GPU launches
[2159.90 --> 2161.70]  have been low volume
[2161.70 --> 2163.44]  and then their post-launch sales
[2163.44 --> 2165.04]  have been even lower volume
[2165.04 --> 2166.12]  for years and years
[2166.12 --> 2166.88]  and years at this point.
[2166.96 --> 2167.48]  Like, I remember
[2167.48 --> 2168.68]  having, like,
[2168.70 --> 2169.94]  a really silly conversation
[2169.94 --> 2171.28]  with a viewer at one point
[2171.28 --> 2171.86]  where they were like,
[2171.94 --> 2173.16]  why don't you ever acknowledge
[2173.16 --> 2174.36]  Vega 56?
[2174.62 --> 2175.00]  And I'm like,
[2175.04 --> 2175.94]  what are you even talking about?
[2175.98 --> 2176.70]  I literally, like...
[2176.70 --> 2177.24]  Seven of them?
[2177.24 --> 2177.98]  I pulled up...
[2177.98 --> 2179.12]  Yeah, I pulled up Newegg
[2179.12 --> 2179.76]  and I was like,
[2180.34 --> 2181.32]  there's one card
[2181.32 --> 2182.90]  and it's like an open box card.
[2183.00 --> 2184.88]  Like, this GPU effectively
[2184.88 --> 2185.72]  doesn't exist.
[2185.80 --> 2186.86]  What are you even talking about?
[2187.38 --> 2187.74]  Or like,
[2187.82 --> 2188.92]  no, it wasn't Vega 56.
[2189.10 --> 2190.10]  It was Radeon 7.
[2190.88 --> 2191.66]  Well, even Vega,
[2192.02 --> 2192.96]  miners bought all of them.
[2193.08 --> 2193.80]  Yeah, but no,
[2193.84 --> 2194.94]  Radeon 7 was different.
[2195.06 --> 2196.88]  Radeon 7 just wasn't a card.
[2197.36 --> 2198.32]  It was this, like,
[2198.40 --> 2199.52]  weird launch thing.
[2200.08 --> 2201.42]  AMD made, like,
[2201.44 --> 2202.10]  a few of them
[2202.10 --> 2202.76]  with their partners.
[2202.96 --> 2203.38]  It was like,
[2203.44 --> 2204.30]  repurposed dyes
[2204.30 --> 2205.36]  from some workstation
[2205.36 --> 2206.44]  or compute card
[2206.44 --> 2206.88]  or something
[2206.88 --> 2208.22]  and then they dropped
[2208.22 --> 2208.98]  driver support,
[2209.12 --> 2210.30]  like, immediately for it.
[2210.34 --> 2211.30]  Like, it was a complete
[2211.30 --> 2212.48]  clown show of a product.
[2212.58 --> 2213.60]  It wasn't a real product
[2213.60 --> 2215.76]  and people were like,
[2216.02 --> 2216.90]  oh, why don't you
[2216.90 --> 2217.72]  don't acknowledge
[2217.72 --> 2218.48]  AMD, the radio,
[2218.58 --> 2219.06]  it's like,
[2219.14 --> 2220.78]  dude, drop your fanboy
[2220.78 --> 2221.14]  s***
[2221.14 --> 2221.94]  because I don't care.
[2222.12 --> 2222.80]  That doesn't...
[2222.80 --> 2223.98]  You're not making sense.
[2224.10 --> 2224.98]  You don't make any sense
[2224.98 --> 2225.46]  right now.
[2226.04 --> 2226.72]  So that...
[2226.72 --> 2227.48]  But that's been
[2227.48 --> 2228.60]  AMD's situation
[2228.60 --> 2230.26]  for years and years and years.
[2230.34 --> 2230.48]  I mean,
[2230.48 --> 2231.88]  even 7900 series
[2231.88 --> 2233.92]  kind of did okay.
[2234.66 --> 2235.46]  But that was it.
[2235.50 --> 2236.46]  It kind of did okay.
[2236.60 --> 2237.24]  I'm not convinced
[2237.24 --> 2237.94]  that they made
[2237.94 --> 2239.34]  any enormous volume
[2239.34 --> 2240.20]  of these cards.
[2240.78 --> 2242.02]  So if I was AMD
[2242.02 --> 2242.76]  and their partners,
[2243.20 --> 2244.34]  even if I thought
[2244.34 --> 2245.58]  I might have something
[2245.58 --> 2246.52]  good on my hands,
[2247.34 --> 2248.18]  I'd have, like,
[2248.26 --> 2248.78]  PTSD
[2248.78 --> 2250.20]  from how many times
[2250.20 --> 2250.84]  I'd been given
[2250.84 --> 2251.70]  the smackdown
[2251.70 --> 2252.42]  from NVIDIA
[2252.42 --> 2253.16]  every time I tried
[2253.16 --> 2254.30]  to launch something decent
[2254.30 --> 2255.74]  and have them just, like,
[2256.06 --> 2257.08]  pull another ace
[2257.08 --> 2258.58]  out of their butt crack
[2258.58 --> 2259.10]  and be like,
[2259.10 --> 2259.48]  boom,
[2259.66 --> 2260.72]  guess you get to sell
[2260.72 --> 2261.46]  nothing.
[2262.44 --> 2263.42]  So overbuilding
[2263.42 --> 2264.00]  for them,
[2264.10 --> 2264.44]  I mean,
[2264.48 --> 2264.90]  is risky.
[2265.04 --> 2265.60]  You've got to think
[2265.60 --> 2266.32]  about the numbers
[2266.32 --> 2267.02]  involved here.
[2267.36 --> 2267.82]  Okay, guys?
[2267.92 --> 2268.96]  Think about the numbers.
[2269.28 --> 2270.12]  If I'm AMD,
[2270.50 --> 2270.76]  okay,
[2271.44 --> 2272.02]  or I'm...
[2272.02 --> 2272.84]  Let's actually...
[2272.84 --> 2273.44]  Let's put ourselves
[2273.44 --> 2275.48]  in the situation
[2275.48 --> 2277.06]  of a board partner
[2277.06 --> 2277.38]  instead
[2277.38 --> 2278.36]  because that's
[2278.36 --> 2279.20]  a much tougher one.
[2279.32 --> 2280.08]  AMD's margins
[2280.08 --> 2281.04]  are going to be better
[2281.04 --> 2283.10]  and their inventory
[2283.10 --> 2283.74]  holdings
[2283.74 --> 2284.76]  are going to be lower
[2284.76 --> 2285.58]  because AMD
[2285.58 --> 2287.74]  only holds GPUs.
[2288.04 --> 2289.22]  Or in some cases,
[2289.22 --> 2290.12]  don't quote me on this,
[2290.12 --> 2291.08]  but my understanding,
[2291.28 --> 2292.46]  at least on the NVIDIA side,
[2292.58 --> 2293.84]  is that they will actually
[2293.84 --> 2294.98]  provide kits,
[2295.38 --> 2296.36]  like GPU kits,
[2296.74 --> 2297.36]  to board partners
[2297.36 --> 2298.20]  and that will include
[2298.20 --> 2299.34]  the GPU and the memory.
[2299.58 --> 2300.30]  So they may take
[2300.30 --> 2300.98]  some margin there,
[2301.04 --> 2301.68]  they may actually
[2301.68 --> 2302.64]  take on some inventory
[2302.64 --> 2303.22]  risk there.
[2303.52 --> 2304.46]  Don't quote me on that
[2304.46 --> 2305.72]  for AMD or even NVIDIA
[2305.72 --> 2306.22]  for that matter,
[2306.28 --> 2306.94]  but what I'm saying
[2306.94 --> 2308.56]  is that they carry
[2308.56 --> 2310.10]  inventory for only part
[2310.10 --> 2311.42]  of the finished product.
[2311.86 --> 2312.96]  The board partner,
[2313.32 --> 2314.52]  they have to take on
[2314.52 --> 2315.82]  inventory for the GPU
[2315.82 --> 2316.46]  die itself,
[2316.46 --> 2317.46]  for the memory,
[2317.82 --> 2318.54]  for the power
[2318.54 --> 2319.46]  delivery components,
[2319.62 --> 2320.90]  the raw PCBs,
[2320.96 --> 2321.76]  any connectors
[2321.76 --> 2322.54]  and doodads,
[2322.92 --> 2323.48]  coolers.
[2323.58 --> 2324.50]  Coolers are a very
[2324.50 --> 2325.40]  significant expense.
[2325.70 --> 2326.64]  So they are holding
[2326.64 --> 2328.10]  enormous inventory.
[2328.58 --> 2329.40]  There's lead time
[2329.40 --> 2330.52]  in terms of building them,
[2330.62 --> 2331.14]  packing them,
[2331.38 --> 2331.88]  shipping them.
[2331.98 --> 2332.94]  So by the time
[2332.94 --> 2334.24]  they're actually
[2334.24 --> 2335.54]  delivering this thing
[2335.54 --> 2336.34]  to a consumer,
[2336.58 --> 2337.76]  if all goes according
[2337.76 --> 2338.24]  to plan,
[2338.42 --> 2339.24]  they have paid
[2339.24 --> 2340.56]  all of their suppliers
[2340.56 --> 2341.34]  for this stuff.
[2341.44 --> 2342.28]  They are effectively
[2342.28 --> 2343.60]  probably not able
[2343.60 --> 2344.60]  to utilize their
[2344.60 --> 2345.76]  net payment terms
[2345.76 --> 2346.48]  much.
[2346.68 --> 2347.52]  And that becomes
[2347.52 --> 2348.28]  even more true
[2348.28 --> 2349.26]  the longer this thing
[2349.26 --> 2350.20]  sits and rots.
[2350.56 --> 2351.96]  So if I'm a board partner
[2351.96 --> 2352.70]  and we're talking
[2352.70 --> 2354.66]  about a $599 product,
[2355.00 --> 2355.66]  I can assume
[2355.66 --> 2356.52]  that my bill of materials
[2356.52 --> 2357.64]  is probably somewhere
[2357.64 --> 2358.16]  in the neighborhood
[2358.16 --> 2360.46]  of $400 to $450
[2360.46 --> 2362.14]  at least.
[2362.56 --> 2364.56]  So let's use $450.
[2365.56 --> 2367.70]  If I overbook,
[2368.32 --> 2368.56]  right?
[2368.86 --> 2370.36]  Like if I overestimate,
[2370.52 --> 2371.54]  and I'm a global company,
[2371.62 --> 2371.80]  right?
[2371.80 --> 2372.90]  So for,
[2373.22 --> 2374.08]  I'm Sapphire,
[2374.28 --> 2374.46]  right?
[2375.06 --> 2376.08]  I gotta supply,
[2376.22 --> 2377.06]  if I supply even
[2377.06 --> 2379.38]  one single GPU
[2379.38 --> 2381.22]  to every computer shop
[2381.22 --> 2381.84]  around the world,
[2381.90 --> 2382.74]  how many am I making?
[2383.40 --> 2383.56]  Right?
[2384.18 --> 2385.30]  Hundreds of thousands,
[2385.76 --> 2386.38]  millions,
[2386.76 --> 2387.02]  you know?
[2387.28 --> 2388.16]  We're talking about
[2388.16 --> 2390.26]  enormous amounts of money.
[2390.78 --> 2393.04]  So if I get it wrong
[2393.04 --> 2395.54]  by even 5,000 units,
[2395.94 --> 2396.22]  right?
[2396.74 --> 2398.88]  That's $2.25 million.
[2398.88 --> 2402.80]  I can't get it wrong.
[2403.50 --> 2404.88]  And if I'm gonna get it wrong,
[2405.20 --> 2406.46]  I'd rather get it wrong
[2406.46 --> 2407.38]  on the low side.
[2407.60 --> 2409.48]  Especially if I've been burned
[2409.48 --> 2411.02]  time and time
[2411.02 --> 2412.12]  and time
[2412.12 --> 2413.44]  and time again
[2413.44 --> 2415.44]  on building a bunch
[2415.44 --> 2416.84]  of these stupid Radeon cards
[2416.84 --> 2417.42]  and then nobody
[2417.42 --> 2418.58]  freaking wanting them.
[2419.26 --> 2419.52]  Right?
[2420.86 --> 2421.88]  So no,
[2422.00 --> 2423.22]  I don't think this is
[2423.22 --> 2424.38]  scarcity marketing.
[2424.92 --> 2425.88]  I think this is
[2425.88 --> 2427.08]  on the NVIDIA side,
[2427.56 --> 2428.86]  them just much rather
[2428.86 --> 2430.14]  using these,
[2430.14 --> 2430.84]  um,
[2431.16 --> 2431.80]  these wafers
[2431.80 --> 2433.80]  to build AI products.
[2434.14 --> 2435.76]  And on the AMD side,
[2435.76 --> 2436.78]  I think this is
[2436.78 --> 2437.72]  as simple as
[2437.72 --> 2439.66]  not buying enough
[2439.66 --> 2440.68]  allocation,
[2440.82 --> 2441.40]  not buying enough
[2441.40 --> 2442.14]  wafer allocation
[2442.14 --> 2442.92]  from TSMC.
[2443.04 --> 2443.84]  I'm sure AMD would love
[2443.84 --> 2444.72]  to be selling more cards,
[2444.90 --> 2445.68]  but they've got to
[2445.68 --> 2446.52]  book wafers
[2446.52 --> 2448.20]  months in advance.
[2448.66 --> 2449.66]  They don't know
[2449.66 --> 2450.96]  that NVIDIA's 50 series
[2450.96 --> 2451.76]  is gonna suck
[2451.76 --> 2453.24]  back when they're booking
[2453.24 --> 2454.74]  launch allocation
[2454.74 --> 2455.94]  for production
[2455.94 --> 2456.82]  for 90-70.
[2456.96 --> 2457.58]  They don't know that.
[2458.42 --> 2459.06]  They might have,
[2459.74 --> 2460.02]  uh,
[2460.08 --> 2460.88]  that is awful,
[2460.92 --> 2461.36]  by the way.
[2462.14 --> 2463.24]  I can pick you up
[2463.24 --> 2464.14]  loud and clear.
[2464.24 --> 2464.52]  Oh yeah.
[2465.14 --> 2465.50]  Um,
[2465.60 --> 2465.78]  all right,
[2465.78 --> 2466.10]  I'll stop.
[2466.52 --> 2466.82]  Yeah.
[2466.90 --> 2467.94]  Or just lean away,
[2468.06 --> 2468.32]  maybe.
[2468.70 --> 2469.00]  Uh,
[2469.00 --> 2469.24]  anyway,
[2469.30 --> 2470.32]  the point is that,
[2470.40 --> 2470.76]  um,
[2471.18 --> 2471.78]  I,
[2471.88 --> 2472.60]  I don't know.
[2472.76 --> 2473.90]  I don't know that
[2473.90 --> 2474.84]  NVIDIA is gonna lay
[2474.84 --> 2476.24]  a huge egg
[2476.24 --> 2477.90]  on their 50 series launch.
[2477.90 --> 2478.50]  I might have
[2478.50 --> 2480.40]  some sort of
[2480.40 --> 2481.82]  whispers
[2481.82 --> 2482.98]  and scuttlebutt
[2482.98 --> 2484.24]  but I'm not gonna
[2484.24 --> 2484.64]  know that their
[2484.64 --> 2485.56]  pricing's gonna suck
[2485.56 --> 2486.34]  because NVIDIA
[2486.34 --> 2486.96]  probably hasn't even
[2486.96 --> 2487.48]  determined their
[2487.48 --> 2487.96]  pricing yet.
[2488.02 --> 2488.48]  They certainly
[2488.48 --> 2489.28]  haven't leaked it
[2489.28 --> 2489.72]  to anybody.
[2489.98 --> 2490.96]  We don't find out
[2490.96 --> 2491.66]  until the very last
[2491.66 --> 2491.90]  minute.
[2492.38 --> 2493.12]  So if I'm AMD,
[2493.28 --> 2493.76]  I'm going like,
[2493.82 --> 2494.38]  oh my god,
[2494.42 --> 2494.92]  I don't know how
[2494.92 --> 2495.94]  many wafers because
[2495.94 --> 2497.64]  50-80 might be,
[2497.76 --> 2498.46]  they might pull a
[2498.46 --> 2499.14]  30 series
[2499.14 --> 2500.64]  and just like,
[2500.94 --> 2501.56]  BOOM,
[2501.82 --> 2502.64]  try to go after
[2502.64 --> 2503.56]  the console market.
[2503.66 --> 2504.16]  You guys remember
[2504.16 --> 2504.58]  that, right?
[2505.12 --> 2506.40]  That's how aggressive
[2506.40 --> 2507.64]  NVIDIA can be
[2507.64 --> 2508.74]  when they want to be
[2508.74 --> 2509.94]  because they were
[2509.94 --> 2510.22]  like,
[2510.46 --> 2510.92]  basically,
[2511.16 --> 2511.94]  f*** the PlayStation
[2511.94 --> 2513.72]  with this Radeon
[2513.72 --> 2515.28]  crap graphics hardware
[2515.28 --> 2515.60]  in it,
[2515.72 --> 2516.66]  f*** the Xbox,
[2517.58 --> 2518.54]  30-80 is,
[2518.62 --> 2519.18]  I forget what the
[2519.18 --> 2520.28]  30-80 MSRP was
[2520.28 --> 2521.08]  but I think it was
[2521.08 --> 2521.86]  like 600 bucks
[2521.86 --> 2522.56]  or something like that.
[2522.62 --> 2522.74]  Like,
[2522.76 --> 2523.52]  it was aggressive
[2523.52 --> 2525.28]  and the 70 was so
[2525.28 --> 2525.74]  powerful,
[2525.90 --> 2526.42]  it was such good
[2526.42 --> 2526.80]  pricing,
[2527.36 --> 2527.50]  right?
[2527.64 --> 2528.42]  NVIDIA can be
[2528.42 --> 2528.88]  aggressive.
[2529.66 --> 2530.46]  So I don't want to
[2530.46 --> 2531.30]  overplay my
[2531.30 --> 2532.28]  pathetic,
[2532.54 --> 2533.10]  you know,
[2533.22 --> 2534.30]  90-70 hand
[2534.30 --> 2535.80]  if I think I might be
[2535.80 --> 2536.98]  up against NVIDIA's
[2536.98 --> 2537.80]  top tier GPU
[2537.80 --> 2538.44]  at that price,
[2538.48 --> 2539.22]  I have no idea.
[2539.60 --> 2540.70]  But then as it turned out,
[2541.02 --> 2541.78]  AMD was going to be
[2541.78 --> 2542.48]  up against their
[2542.48 --> 2543.96]  like fourth tier down
[2543.96 --> 2544.70]  and they were
[2544.70 --> 2545.38]  super competitive.
[2546.14 --> 2546.72]  So yeah,
[2546.74 --> 2547.28]  they might ramp
[2547.28 --> 2547.76]  things up
[2547.76 --> 2548.30]  but it's going to
[2548.30 --> 2548.78]  take time.
[2550.12 --> 2550.84]  What else did we
[2550.84 --> 2551.46]  have for discussion
[2551.46 --> 2551.72]  here?
[2552.92 --> 2553.70]  I think that's it
[2553.70 --> 2554.46]  for the GPUs.
[2555.80 --> 2556.24]  All right,
[2556.28 --> 2556.66]  good chat.
[2558.22 --> 2558.58]  Fascinate.
[2559.46 --> 2560.86]  What do you want
[2560.86 --> 2561.72]  to talk about today?
[2561.80 --> 2562.46]  Oh my god,
[2562.48 --> 2562.78]  are we supposed
[2562.78 --> 2563.48]  to do merch messages
[2563.48 --> 2563.98]  already, Dan?
[2564.02 --> 2564.56]  Did I just take
[2564.56 --> 2565.20]  way too long
[2565.20 --> 2565.78]  to go through that?
[2565.88 --> 2566.02]  Yeah,
[2566.10 --> 2567.02]  you spoke for about
[2567.02 --> 2567.58]  40 minutes.
[2567.58 --> 2568.62]  45 minutes.
[2568.94 --> 2569.08]  Oh,
[2569.32 --> 2570.50]  so very long.
[2570.92 --> 2571.62]  We better rush
[2571.62 --> 2572.14]  through the rest
[2572.14 --> 2572.54]  of this.
[2572.94 --> 2573.32]  Okay,
[2573.52 --> 2573.94]  was it,
[2574.02 --> 2574.84]  was it boring?
[2574.94 --> 2575.08]  Sorry,
[2575.12 --> 2575.86]  I'm feeling insecure.
[2576.52 --> 2577.08]  I think it was
[2577.08 --> 2577.62]  pretty good.
[2577.68 --> 2578.00]  I would have
[2578.00 --> 2578.62]  cut you off
[2578.62 --> 2579.38]  but yeah,
[2579.52 --> 2579.94]  it was,
[2580.06 --> 2580.80]  I think it was
[2580.80 --> 2580.96]  good.
[2581.02 --> 2581.28]  It was just
[2581.28 --> 2582.24]  really long.
[2582.60 --> 2582.88]  Cool.
[2588.38 --> 2589.12]  Circumcision doctor
[2589.12 --> 2589.70]  says what?
[2591.36 --> 2592.28]  It's probably up
[2592.28 --> 2592.72]  there for one
[2592.72 --> 2593.24]  of the longest
[2593.24 --> 2594.18]  topics we've
[2594.18 --> 2594.58]  ever done.
[2594.58 --> 2595.02]  Uh,
[2595.06 --> 2595.34]  okay,
[2595.60 --> 2595.82]  cool.
[2595.98 --> 2596.14]  Yeah,
[2596.32 --> 2597.90]  dead antisocial
[2597.90 --> 2598.44]  and floatplane
[2598.44 --> 2599.14]  chat says you
[2599.14 --> 2599.90]  talk too much
[2599.90 --> 2600.80]  on your show.
[2603.80 --> 2604.50]  All right,
[2604.60 --> 2604.88]  uh,
[2604.88 --> 2605.78]  merch messages.
[2606.08 --> 2606.34]  Uh,
[2606.34 --> 2606.74]  the way to
[2606.74 --> 2607.40]  interact with
[2607.40 --> 2608.00]  the show is
[2608.00 --> 2609.00]  to send a
[2609.00 --> 2610.14]  merch message.
[2610.32 --> 2610.62]  Uh,
[2610.62 --> 2610.98]  we don't do
[2610.98 --> 2611.52]  twitch bits,
[2611.58 --> 2612.32]  we don't do,
[2612.48 --> 2612.86]  um,
[2613.08 --> 2613.48]  whatever the
[2613.48 --> 2614.18]  other thing is,
[2614.24 --> 2614.72]  uh,
[2615.48 --> 2616.08]  super chats.
[2616.22 --> 2616.78]  We do merch
[2616.78 --> 2617.62]  messages because
[2617.62 --> 2618.62]  the way we see
[2618.62 --> 2618.82]  it,
[2618.92 --> 2619.38]  if you're going
[2619.38 --> 2619.94]  to throw money
[2619.94 --> 2620.58]  at your screen,
[2620.72 --> 2621.44]  you should get
[2621.44 --> 2622.48]  some fine
[2622.48 --> 2623.80]  lttstore.com
[2623.80 --> 2624.90]  merchandise in
[2624.90 --> 2625.52]  return.
[2625.74 --> 2626.56]  And we've got a
[2626.56 --> 2627.54]  great little launch
[2627.54 --> 2628.34]  for you guys this
[2628.34 --> 2628.58]  week.
[2629.22 --> 2629.74]  Introducing
[2629.74 --> 2634.00]  the terminally
[2634.00 --> 2636.10]  online pun
[2636.10 --> 2637.14]  very much
[2637.14 --> 2637.58]  intended.
[2641.26 --> 2642.22]  Thank you.
[2642.28 --> 2642.84]  There we go.
[2643.04 --> 2644.00]  Hoodie and
[2644.00 --> 2644.70]  t-shirt.
[2644.84 --> 2645.74]  It is a brand
[2645.74 --> 2646.78]  new design that
[2646.78 --> 2647.66]  is an homage to
[2647.66 --> 2648.88]  90s hardware and
[2648.88 --> 2650.12]  to your lifelong
[2650.12 --> 2651.04]  commitment to
[2651.04 --> 2652.04]  being online.
[2652.20 --> 2653.04]  It's available as
[2653.04 --> 2654.74]  both a hoodie and
[2654.74 --> 2655.20]  a t-shirt.
[2655.32 --> 2655.84]  And I gotta say,
[2655.90 --> 2656.02]  man,
[2656.08 --> 2656.72]  I saw the hoodie
[2656.72 --> 2657.46]  on set the other
[2657.46 --> 2657.90]  day and I was
[2657.90 --> 2658.06]  like,
[2658.10 --> 2658.22]  yo,
[2658.24 --> 2658.78]  is that ours?
[2659.12 --> 2659.54]  Because I had
[2659.54 --> 2660.38]  forgotten that I
[2660.38 --> 2661.06]  greenlit this
[2661.06 --> 2661.46]  design.
[2661.58 --> 2662.40]  The hoodie looks
[2662.40 --> 2663.92]  flipping sick.
[2664.50 --> 2664.80]  Um,
[2664.84 --> 2666.16]  these are printed
[2666.16 --> 2667.82]  to order here in
[2667.82 --> 2668.72]  Canada for a
[2668.72 --> 2669.38]  long lasting,
[2669.68 --> 2670.50]  vibrant print that
[2670.50 --> 2671.40]  was very well
[2671.40 --> 2672.26]  reviewed by
[2672.26 --> 2673.54]  Project Farm on
[2673.54 --> 2675.06]  our classic cozy
[2675.06 --> 2676.08]  terricotten hoodie
[2676.08 --> 2677.30]  blanks or our
[2677.30 --> 2678.48]  legendary t-shirt
[2678.48 --> 2678.86]  blanks.
[2678.88 --> 2680.32]  And like most
[2680.32 --> 2681.02]  of our sweatshirts,
[2681.12 --> 2681.60]  the hoodie also
[2681.60 --> 2682.32]  features a secure
[2682.32 --> 2683.30]  pocket for your
[2683.30 --> 2683.82]  phone,
[2683.98 --> 2684.16]  wallet,
[2684.30 --> 2684.54]  keys,
[2684.62 --> 2685.24]  or earbuds.
[2685.58 --> 2686.36]  Get it now at
[2686.36 --> 2687.10]  lmg.gg
[2687.10 --> 2688.52]  slash terminally
[2688.52 --> 2689.70]  online.
[2690.54 --> 2691.54]  And I would say
[2691.54 --> 2692.54]  our t-shirts are
[2692.54 --> 2693.52]  pretty well priced
[2693.52 --> 2694.46]  even with tariffs.
[2694.70 --> 2695.22]  Let's go.
[2695.96 --> 2696.18]  Uh,
[2696.22 --> 2696.50]  yeah,
[2696.54 --> 2697.18]  they're putting a
[2697.18 --> 2697.88]  lot of pressure on
[2697.88 --> 2698.84]  me to increase our
[2698.84 --> 2699.64]  t-shirt pricing,
[2699.72 --> 2700.16]  by the way.
[2700.80 --> 2701.30]  So I'm not
[2701.30 --> 2701.88]  surprised.
[2702.42 --> 2702.80]  Um,
[2702.96 --> 2704.08]  I've wanted to
[2704.08 --> 2704.84]  treat the t-shirts
[2704.84 --> 2705.62]  like the Costco
[2705.62 --> 2706.20]  hot dog.
[2706.64 --> 2706.96]  Uh,
[2706.96 --> 2707.84]  I even told
[2707.84 --> 2708.38]  someone in a
[2708.38 --> 2708.66]  meeting,
[2708.78 --> 2710.08]  I'll kill you if
[2710.08 --> 2710.74]  you increase the
[2710.74 --> 2711.52]  price of the t-shirt.
[2711.62 --> 2712.30]  It's a reference.
[2712.40 --> 2713.16]  It's a reference.
[2713.80 --> 2714.96]  It's a reference.
[2716.16 --> 2717.12]  Did Ariana know
[2717.12 --> 2717.78]  that before now?
[2717.94 --> 2718.34]  Um,
[2718.44 --> 2718.64]  yeah,
[2718.64 --> 2719.44]  it was Nick,
[2719.56 --> 2719.96]  so it doesn't
[2719.96 --> 2720.22]  matter.
[2720.88 --> 2721.28]  Um,
[2721.48 --> 2723.62]  I can threaten to
[2723.62 --> 2724.02]  kill Nick.
[2724.08 --> 2724.46]  It's fine.
[2724.94 --> 2725.98]  The point is,
[2726.06 --> 2727.08]  the point is that,
[2727.14 --> 2727.60]  uh,
[2728.40 --> 2729.62]  it's a reference.
[2730.34 --> 2731.02]  It's a reference.
[2731.08 --> 2731.50]  He gets,
[2731.60 --> 2732.22]  he knows the
[2732.22 --> 2732.86]  reference.
[2733.74 --> 2734.74]  He'll kill him in
[2734.74 --> 2735.08]  Minecraft.
[2735.48 --> 2735.80]  Yeah,
[2735.86 --> 2736.34]  exactly.
[2736.34 --> 2736.70]  Yeah,
[2736.74 --> 2737.26]  yeah,
[2737.38 --> 2737.72]  yeah,
[2737.72 --> 2737.76]  yeah.
[2737.92 --> 2738.40]  Yeah.
[2738.70 --> 2739.18]  Um,
[2739.82 --> 2740.32]  however,
[2740.64 --> 2741.64]  that team has
[2741.64 --> 2742.86]  goals in terms of
[2742.86 --> 2744.34]  maintaining profitability
[2744.34 --> 2746.16]  under CEO Taron Tong,
[2746.32 --> 2748.14]  and they are telling me
[2748.14 --> 2749.38]  that our t-shirt pricing
[2749.38 --> 2751.18]  is becoming untenable.
[2751.40 --> 2751.74]  Uh,
[2751.74 --> 2752.70]  we have never adjusted
[2752.70 --> 2752.94]  it.
[2753.02 --> 2753.34]  It's funny.
[2753.42 --> 2755.36]  We take so much flack
[2755.36 --> 2756.12]  for our supposedly
[2756.12 --> 2757.24]  expensive products.
[2757.74 --> 2758.06]  And yeah,
[2758.18 --> 2758.32]  oh,
[2758.40 --> 2758.74]  here it is.
[2758.74 --> 2764.16]  This is an extremely
[2764.16 --> 2765.00]  expensive hoodie.
[2765.60 --> 2766.40]  I get it.
[2767.28 --> 2769.06]  It is embroidered.
[2769.44 --> 2770.98]  This is not printed.
[2771.84 --> 2773.36]  Go find me
[2773.36 --> 2774.72]  an all over
[2774.72 --> 2776.00]  embroidered garment
[2776.00 --> 2777.20]  that is less than
[2777.20 --> 2778.72]  150 US dollars.
[2779.68 --> 2780.84]  Go find it.
[2781.02 --> 2781.42]  It should,
[2781.58 --> 2782.22]  it should probably be
[2782.22 --> 2783.04]  at least a sweater
[2783.04 --> 2783.50]  because someone's
[2783.50 --> 2784.24]  going to find like,
[2785.36 --> 2785.56]  uh,
[2785.66 --> 2786.06]  sure.
[2786.20 --> 2786.36]  Like,
[2786.50 --> 2787.34]  find me pants
[2787.34 --> 2787.96]  or a hoodie.
[2787.96 --> 2789.10]  Find me pants
[2789.10 --> 2789.58]  or a hoodie.
[2789.66 --> 2790.58]  Something big.
[2790.96 --> 2792.40]  It costs a fortune.
[2792.48 --> 2793.00]  What do you want
[2793.00 --> 2793.40]  from me?
[2793.74 --> 2794.32]  Not every product
[2794.32 --> 2794.76]  is for everybody.
[2794.76 --> 2795.12]  It has to be all
[2795.12 --> 2795.82]  over embroidered,
[2795.86 --> 2796.70]  not just a little logo.
[2797.52 --> 2798.42]  Not every product
[2798.42 --> 2799.58]  is for every person.
[2799.78 --> 2800.66]  I know it's expensive,
[2800.66 --> 2801.56]  but what it isn't
[2801.56 --> 2802.42]  is overpriced.
[2802.62 --> 2803.48]  It's priced for what
[2803.48 --> 2803.80]  it is.
[2803.82 --> 2804.00]  Anyway,
[2804.06 --> 2804.70]  the point is,
[2805.04 --> 2805.62]  our t-shirts,
[2805.80 --> 2806.56]  they're like 20 bucks.
[2806.56 --> 2808.18]  I can't think of a single
[2808.18 --> 2809.08]  other,
[2809.08 --> 2809.72]  like,
[2809.90 --> 2811.18]  creator merch
[2811.18 --> 2812.48]  that is $20
[2812.48 --> 2813.30]  for a t-shirt
[2813.30 --> 2814.46]  for a printed tee,
[2814.66 --> 2815.72]  quality printed tee,
[2815.80 --> 2816.26]  so I don't even want
[2816.26 --> 2816.68]  to hear it.
[2817.12 --> 2817.40]  Um,
[2817.46 --> 2817.78]  anyway,
[2818.04 --> 2819.02]  the point is that
[2819.02 --> 2819.58]  we've also,
[2819.72 --> 2820.48]  we've also got the hoodie,
[2820.60 --> 2821.46]  which you guys can see here,
[2821.50 --> 2822.02]  which by the way,
[2822.08 --> 2823.54]  also has printing on the back,
[2823.58 --> 2824.64]  which costs us more,
[2825.12 --> 2825.36]  uh,
[2825.36 --> 2826.86]  and that's 60 US dollars
[2826.86 --> 2828.10]  for our fine
[2828.10 --> 2829.56]  terminally online hoodie.
[2829.62 --> 2830.64]  This is a great shot,
[2830.70 --> 2831.10]  by the way.
[2831.54 --> 2833.02]  I love this.
[2833.62 --> 2834.62]  There they are,
[2835.56 --> 2836.08]  Gen Z,
[2836.80 --> 2838.12]  not talking to each other
[2838.12 --> 2839.20]  on their phones.
[2839.66 --> 2840.24]  It's perfect.
[2840.36 --> 2840.82]  It's flawless.
[2841.08 --> 2841.54]  Great job,
[2841.62 --> 2841.92]  Tatiana,
[2842.24 --> 2842.48]  Sammy,
[2842.68 --> 2843.62]  and I assume Artie
[2843.62 --> 2844.32]  was probably involved
[2844.32 --> 2845.06]  in that shoot as well.
[2846.52 --> 2847.82]  I'm trying to find a sweater
[2847.82 --> 2848.48]  because there's like,
[2848.56 --> 2849.66]  there's probably one of them.
[2849.88 --> 2850.74]  What I'm finding is
[2850.74 --> 2851.74]  a lot of them will say
[2851.74 --> 2852.96]  embroidered design
[2852.96 --> 2853.86]  and it's printed,
[2854.04 --> 2854.78]  but it looks like
[2854.78 --> 2855.42]  it's embroidered.
[2855.62 --> 2856.66]  Digitized D says,
[2856.86 --> 2857.82]  I digitize embroidery
[2857.82 --> 2858.78]  and I promise
[2858.78 --> 2859.86]  that's cheap for a hoodie.
[2859.86 --> 2861.46]  Exactly.
[2862.72 --> 2863.04]  And I'm not,
[2863.08 --> 2863.36]  okay,
[2863.36 --> 2864.02]  it's not cheap,
[2864.14 --> 2865.16]  but what it is is fair.
[2865.52 --> 2866.98]  It is fairly priced.
[2867.80 --> 2868.16]  We have,
[2868.22 --> 2870.22]  we have a cost markup model
[2870.22 --> 2871.02]  for our stuff.
[2871.66 --> 2872.92]  We're not demanding
[2872.92 --> 2874.50]  some ridiculous margin.
[2875.18 --> 2875.56]  Um,
[2876.10 --> 2877.08]  and if you think we are,
[2877.18 --> 2877.34]  hey,
[2877.56 --> 2879.00]  you don't have to buy anything.
[2879.44 --> 2880.50]  That's totally okay.
[2880.64 --> 2881.36]  uh,
[2881.46 --> 2881.78]  any,
[2881.94 --> 2882.34]  uh,
[2882.40 --> 2882.60]  any,
[2882.72 --> 2882.90]  uh,
[2882.90 --> 2883.74]  news on the,
[2883.84 --> 2884.32]  uh,
[2884.32 --> 2885.84]  I left it alone for a while.
[2885.94 --> 2886.36]  I did.
[2886.52 --> 2887.28]  I was a good boy
[2887.28 --> 2887.86]  for a little bit.
[2887.88 --> 2888.30]  I'm gonna,
[2888.60 --> 2889.00]  I'm gonna,
[2889.00 --> 2890.20]  I'm gonna get one in there.
[2890.28 --> 2890.82]  What's coming?
[2890.94 --> 2892.10]  Any news on the talls?
[2892.72 --> 2893.12]  Oh,
[2893.20 --> 2893.90]  the tall blanks?
[2893.98 --> 2894.24]  I,
[2894.28 --> 2894.50]  I,
[2894.50 --> 2894.58]  I,
[2894.58 --> 2895.46]  I don't know.
[2895.50 --> 2896.30]  As far as I know,
[2896.34 --> 2897.32]  we're just ordering them.
[2897.50 --> 2898.38]  I was told,
[2898.82 --> 2900.32]  I was told we have no less
[2900.32 --> 2901.86]  than $3 million
[2901.86 --> 2903.18]  of inventory incoming.
[2904.02 --> 2904.42]  So,
[2904.42 --> 2906.32]  things are a little bare
[2906.32 --> 2907.46]  right now on the store.
[2907.52 --> 2907.78]  Okay.
[2907.78 --> 2908.56]  We know,
[2908.88 --> 2909.32]  we know,
[2909.32 --> 2909.34]  we know,
[2909.34 --> 2910.64]  and I have been told
[2910.64 --> 2912.10]  we have $3 million
[2912.10 --> 2913.24]  of stuff on order.
[2913.48 --> 2913.62]  So,
[2913.74 --> 2914.04]  hopefully,
[2914.20 --> 2915.02]  there's some tall blanks
[2915.02 --> 2916.04]  in there.
[2916.18 --> 2916.80]  But that's all I know.
[2916.90 --> 2916.92]  Well,
[2916.92 --> 2917.32]  you're gonna sell a bunch
[2917.32 --> 2918.22]  of tall blanks immediately
[2918.22 --> 2918.94]  because I'm not waiting
[2918.94 --> 2919.64]  this time.
[2920.00 --> 2920.82]  Let's go.
[2921.32 --> 2922.42]  I'm just gonna buy
[2922.42 --> 2923.22]  a bunch immediately.
[2923.68 --> 2924.80]  I was nice last time.
[2924.92 --> 2925.26]  I was like,
[2925.28 --> 2925.92]  I'll let the audience
[2925.92 --> 2926.74]  get some this time.
[2927.04 --> 2927.72]  Screw you guys.
[2928.20 --> 2929.34]  I'm tired of this.
[2929.82 --> 2930.64]  I don't want to wait
[2930.64 --> 2932.02]  like seven more months
[2932.02 --> 2932.98]  to be able to buy a shirt.
[2932.98 --> 2936.98]  I will sit on WAN Show
[2936.98 --> 2937.48]  when they're announced
[2937.48 --> 2938.64]  and I will order them live.
[2939.20 --> 2940.36]  I will race all of you.
[2940.40 --> 2941.36]  Oh my goodness.
[2941.66 --> 2942.52]  Fight me now.
[2942.70 --> 2943.08]  Okay.
[2946.78 --> 2947.18]  Anyway,
[2947.42 --> 2948.22]  we have an announcement.
[2948.22 --> 2949.20]  If you were wondering
[2949.20 --> 2952.34]  about the toque
[2952.34 --> 2953.12]  that I was wearing,
[2953.50 --> 2954.94]  I refuse to call it a beanie.
[2955.18 --> 2957.40]  That is my act of solidarity
[2957.40 --> 2958.50]  with my fellow Canadians
[2958.50 --> 2959.46]  in this trying time.
[2959.98 --> 2960.70]  If you're wondering
[2960.70 --> 2961.26]  about the toques
[2961.26 --> 2962.24]  that I was wearing earlier,
[2962.24 --> 2963.50]  it's because of the
[2963.50 --> 2964.90]  Why is WAN Late series,
[2965.14 --> 2966.02]  a fan favorite
[2966.02 --> 2967.26]  Floatplane exclusive series
[2967.26 --> 2967.90]  that shows you
[2967.90 --> 2969.06]  the behind the scenes
[2969.06 --> 2970.04]  of what Luke and I
[2970.04 --> 2971.00]  are up to each Friday.
[2971.26 --> 2972.18]  We've been competing
[2972.18 --> 2973.68]  to see who is the one
[2973.68 --> 2974.80]  who makes WAN late
[2974.80 --> 2977.06]  and as you can see,
[2977.32 --> 2979.04]  I lost most recently.
[2979.20 --> 2980.52]  To see all seven episodes
[2980.52 --> 2981.70]  in this monthly series,
[2981.92 --> 2982.32]  head over to
[2982.32 --> 2983.20]  lmg.gg
[2983.20 --> 2984.04]  slash
[2984.04 --> 2985.02]  Floatplane.
[2985.92 --> 2986.06]  Actually,
[2986.28 --> 2986.78]  I'll lose every time.
[2987.44 --> 2987.68]  Actually,
[2987.74 --> 2988.54]  I think I have a new
[2988.54 --> 2989.40]  I think I have a new
[2989.40 --> 2990.68]  favorite exclusive over there.
[2990.84 --> 2991.66]  I checked out
[2991.66 --> 2992.60]  a little bit of this
[2992.60 --> 2993.80]  and then Sammy told me
[2993.80 --> 2994.84]  I had to stop watching it
[2994.84 --> 2995.66]  because he wants to get me
[2995.66 --> 2996.46]  to react to it,
[2996.52 --> 2997.92]  but it is so funny.
[2998.90 --> 2999.96]  LMG team members
[2999.96 --> 3001.56]  shared their first meeting
[3001.56 --> 3002.14]  with me.
[3002.56 --> 3003.72]  So we've got Emily
[3003.72 --> 3004.98]  from the editing team,
[3005.16 --> 3006.32]  Mark from the editing team,
[3006.60 --> 3006.88]  Vance,
[3007.02 --> 3007.98]  the executive assistant,
[3008.14 --> 3008.90]  and then Nicole
[3008.90 --> 3009.90]  from HR.
[3010.84 --> 3011.02]  And,
[3011.06 --> 3012.12]  excuse me,
[3012.80 --> 3013.64]  what do they call it?
[3013.70 --> 3013.88]  Oh,
[3013.96 --> 3014.36]  bloody hell.
[3014.42 --> 3015.74]  What's the like custodian
[3015.74 --> 3016.72]  version of HR?
[3017.96 --> 3019.00]  Culture and talent.
[3019.20 --> 3020.66]  Culture and talent department.
[3020.66 --> 3022.80]  Custodian version?
[3023.04 --> 3023.26]  Yeah,
[3023.36 --> 3024.52]  like custodian
[3024.52 --> 3025.44]  versus janitor,
[3025.76 --> 3026.30]  receptionist
[3026.30 --> 3027.24]  versus secretary.
[3028.22 --> 3029.18]  Culture and talent
[3029.18 --> 3030.22]  instead of HR.
[3030.94 --> 3031.22]  You know,
[3031.32 --> 3031.80]  like the,
[3032.16 --> 3032.46]  yeah.
[3033.48 --> 3033.84]  Sure.
[3034.70 --> 3035.10]  Yeah.
[3035.58 --> 3035.94]  Sure.
[3036.20 --> 3036.58]  All right.
[3036.72 --> 3037.02]  Anyway,
[3037.02 --> 3038.14]  people are loving this one.
[3038.40 --> 3039.10]  Check it out
[3039.10 --> 3040.04]  at lmg.gg
[3040.04 --> 3040.50]  slash
[3040.50 --> 3041.14]  Floatplane.
[3042.04 --> 3042.40]  Oh,
[3042.46 --> 3043.00]  we haven't even done
[3043.00 --> 3043.76]  a merch message yet.
[3043.82 --> 3043.96]  Right,
[3043.98 --> 3044.82]  how do you send a merch message?
[3044.90 --> 3045.50]  You go on the store,
[3045.72 --> 3046.46]  pick up something nice,
[3046.50 --> 3047.18]  and in the cart,
[3047.32 --> 3048.46]  you will see a little box
[3048.46 --> 3049.36]  to send a merch message
[3049.36 --> 3050.06]  to producer Dan,
[3050.54 --> 3051.54]  who is,
[3051.74 --> 3051.78]  sorry,
[3052.68 --> 3053.68]  has been waiting,
[3054.38 --> 3055.86]  staged for this
[3055.86 --> 3057.78]  terminally online moment
[3057.78 --> 3059.78]  for Lord only knows how long,
[3060.44 --> 3060.66]  and,
[3060.68 --> 3063.04]  and will give us a,
[3063.26 --> 3064.18]  who will either reply
[3064.18 --> 3064.84]  to your message,
[3064.98 --> 3065.90]  pop it up down there,
[3065.90 --> 3066.78]  or curate it
[3066.78 --> 3067.36]  for me and Luke
[3067.36 --> 3068.18]  to talk about.
[3068.52 --> 3068.96]  Hit me,
[3069.04 --> 3069.14]  Dan.
[3069.22 --> 3070.20]  I get one occasionally.
[3070.82 --> 3071.32]  Why do you guys
[3071.32 --> 3072.52]  completely remove products
[3072.52 --> 3073.24]  from the website,
[3073.36 --> 3074.32]  i.e. the tech bro
[3074.32 --> 3075.28]  or the workshop jacket?
[3075.28 --> 3076.48]  It means there's no info
[3076.48 --> 3077.12]  and tech specs
[3077.12 --> 3078.24]  to reference for reselling
[3078.24 --> 3079.40]  or just product comparing
[3079.40 --> 3080.04]  in general?
[3080.50 --> 3080.84]  Um,
[3080.98 --> 3082.84]  because it was confusing
[3082.84 --> 3083.72]  and made the site
[3083.72 --> 3084.48]  really cluttered
[3084.48 --> 3085.48]  for people who were shopping
[3085.48 --> 3086.56]  for stuff that we do have
[3086.56 --> 3086.98]  for sale.
[3087.40 --> 3087.80]  However,
[3088.22 --> 3088.70]  when we,
[3088.90 --> 3089.82]  I think there's a redesign
[3089.82 --> 3090.62]  coming up
[3090.62 --> 3091.36]  that will include
[3091.36 --> 3092.44]  an old product archive
[3092.44 --> 3092.98]  and we,
[3093.10 --> 3094.44]  we are going to do that.
[3095.48 --> 3096.64]  It's taking longer
[3096.64 --> 3097.28]  than I would like,
[3097.44 --> 3097.64]  but,
[3098.36 --> 3100.62]  I don't know what to say
[3100.62 --> 3101.12]  other than
[3101.12 --> 3102.58]  things take time
[3102.58 --> 3103.08]  sometimes
[3103.08 --> 3104.52]  and I'm really sorry
[3104.52 --> 3104.96]  for that.
[3106.18 --> 3106.72]  Hey DLL,
[3106.96 --> 3107.72]  on launch day
[3107.72 --> 3108.36]  I tried to buy
[3108.36 --> 3110.22]  a 9070 XT
[3110.22 --> 3111.04]  while watching
[3111.04 --> 3111.78]  stock vanish.
[3112.08 --> 3113.14]  I accidentally bought
[3113.14 --> 3114.26]  a 9070
[3114.26 --> 3116.70]  for 650 US dollars
[3116.70 --> 3118.54]  on Newegg.
[3118.72 --> 3119.48]  Should I just cut
[3119.48 --> 3119.96]  my losses
[3119.96 --> 3120.62]  and return it
[3120.62 --> 3121.10]  or is this
[3121.10 --> 3121.78]  an okay price?
[3124.28 --> 3124.78]  What was it?
[3124.84 --> 3125.24]  650?
[3125.68 --> 3126.04]  650.
[3126.78 --> 3127.30]  Man,
[3127.50 --> 3128.66]  I do not love
[3128.66 --> 3129.26]  that card.
[3129.68 --> 3129.96]  Um,
[3130.04 --> 3130.32]  however...
[3130.32 --> 3130.44]  Dude,
[3130.44 --> 3130.96]  it's so hard
[3130.96 --> 3131.48]  to determine
[3131.48 --> 3132.68]  what an okay price is
[3132.68 --> 3133.84]  when nothing's in stock
[3133.84 --> 3134.60]  and all the prices
[3134.60 --> 3135.90]  just yo-yoing constantly.
[3136.02 --> 3136.94]  Like a big problem
[3136.94 --> 3137.94]  with the 9070
[3137.94 --> 3138.84]  is the clock speed.
[3139.34 --> 3139.60]  Like,
[3139.70 --> 3139.90]  yeah,
[3139.94 --> 3141.00]  it's got fewer CUs
[3141.00 --> 3142.10]  and all of that,
[3142.18 --> 3143.48]  but it has 16 gigs of RAM.
[3144.26 --> 3144.66]  Um,
[3144.90 --> 3145.50]  and so,
[3145.62 --> 3146.66]  a big part of the problem
[3146.66 --> 3147.34]  is the clock speed.
[3147.44 --> 3147.88]  I actually,
[3148.00 --> 3148.38]  we didn't,
[3148.78 --> 3149.08]  there was,
[3149.20 --> 3150.08]  we don't have much time
[3150.08 --> 3151.28]  when it comes to launch,
[3151.28 --> 3152.74]  like launch embargo reviews.
[3152.74 --> 3153.04]  So,
[3153.18 --> 3154.20]  I don't know
[3154.20 --> 3155.58]  if it overclocks
[3155.58 --> 3156.52]  like a bat out of hell.
[3156.52 --> 3157.10]  Like,
[3157.16 --> 3157.76]  it's possible
[3157.76 --> 3158.52]  that that card
[3158.52 --> 3159.18]  could be
[3159.18 --> 3161.34]  a much more
[3161.34 --> 3162.76]  competent card
[3162.76 --> 3164.18]  than it reviewed as.
[3164.78 --> 3165.14]  Um,
[3165.24 --> 3166.50]  I don't love that card
[3166.50 --> 3167.20]  at that price.
[3167.52 --> 3168.08]  And,
[3168.22 --> 3168.68]  personally,
[3169.22 --> 3170.78]  I still have not
[3170.78 --> 3171.90]  actually pulled the trigger
[3171.90 --> 3173.48]  on my 5090 upgrade
[3173.48 --> 3174.70]  for this cycle
[3174.70 --> 3175.24]  because,
[3175.68 --> 3176.18]  um,
[3176.56 --> 3177.38]  I'm waiting to see
[3177.38 --> 3177.86]  if Plouffe
[3177.86 --> 3179.20]  actually doesn't go through
[3179.20 --> 3179.70]  with his order.
[3179.88 --> 3181.02]  He has a pre-order
[3181.02 --> 3181.68]  in at Best Buy
[3181.68 --> 3183.40]  and he said
[3183.40 --> 3184.16]  he'd give it to me
[3184.16 --> 3185.24]  because he decided
[3185.24 --> 3186.06]  not to go through
[3186.06 --> 3186.38]  with it,
[3186.44 --> 3186.86]  but I think
[3186.86 --> 3187.34]  he might change
[3187.34 --> 3187.88]  his mind still
[3187.88 --> 3188.36]  so I'm not going
[3188.36 --> 3189.06]  to hold him to it.
[3189.24 --> 3189.40]  But,
[3189.50 --> 3189.74]  um,
[3190.10 --> 3190.86]  I'll take that
[3190.86 --> 3191.34]  but I,
[3191.52 --> 3192.66]  I gotta be honest
[3192.66 --> 3193.30]  with you guys
[3193.30 --> 3194.26]  on principle
[3194.26 --> 3195.66]  and it's funny
[3195.66 --> 3196.46]  because I,
[3196.48 --> 3197.92]  I often see people
[3197.92 --> 3199.46]  kind of getting on me
[3199.46 --> 3201.02]  about being rich
[3201.02 --> 3202.10]  and,
[3202.10 --> 3203.02]  sorry,
[3203.16 --> 3204.16]  how did you phrase it?
[3204.68 --> 3205.54]  Quite wealthy.
[3208.48 --> 3208.88]  Okay,
[3209.12 --> 3209.38]  yeah,
[3209.46 --> 3210.24]  you're gonna talk shade,
[3210.34 --> 3210.48]  mister,
[3210.54 --> 3211.54]  I'm gonna buy a plane.
[3212.54 --> 3213.74]  I'm not talking shade,
[3213.86 --> 3214.72]  I'm not talking shade.
[3214.72 --> 3216.84]  What I'm saying is,
[3216.98 --> 3218.86]  what I'm saying is,
[3218.86 --> 3223.66]  sorry,
[3223.80 --> 3224.00]  you're good.
[3224.00 --> 3224.60]  Do you need a minute?
[3225.10 --> 3225.66]  You need a minute?
[3225.78 --> 3225.82]  No,
[3225.82 --> 3226.14]  I'm good,
[3226.18 --> 3226.46]  I'm good.
[3226.54 --> 3226.76]  So,
[3226.90 --> 3227.36]  I'll often,
[3227.48 --> 3228.72]  I'll often see people
[3228.72 --> 3229.80]  kind of come at me
[3229.80 --> 3231.56]  because I'll say like,
[3231.62 --> 3231.78]  look,
[3231.88 --> 3232.06]  no,
[3232.12 --> 3232.70]  that's expensive,
[3232.82 --> 3233.58]  I'm not gonna buy it.
[3234.12 --> 3234.40]  Yeah,
[3234.54 --> 3235.52]  the reality of it is
[3235.52 --> 3236.62]  I could buy a 5090,
[3236.68 --> 3237.80]  I could buy a 5090 right now,
[3237.86 --> 3238.46]  I could go on eBay,
[3238.60 --> 3239.88]  I could buy a scalp 5090,
[3239.88 --> 3240.82]  but fuck that,
[3240.94 --> 3241.98]  I'm not going to
[3241.98 --> 3243.58]  because that's lame.
[3244.84 --> 3246.46]  Because I'm sitting here
[3246.46 --> 3247.88]  telling you guys,
[3248.62 --> 3250.48]  don't buy scalped GPUs,
[3251.04 --> 3252.00]  don't contribute
[3252.00 --> 3253.60]  to the crappiness
[3253.60 --> 3254.64]  of the GPU market
[3254.64 --> 3256.06]  by paying these prices.
[3256.26 --> 3256.38]  So,
[3257.12 --> 3257.50]  what?
[3257.60 --> 3258.62]  Because I'm in a position
[3258.62 --> 3259.78]  where I can just afford
[3259.78 --> 3261.18]  to just buy it,
[3261.34 --> 3262.80]  so then I just should?
[3263.00 --> 3263.92]  How hypocritical
[3263.92 --> 3264.54]  would that be?
[3264.98 --> 3265.26]  And so,
[3265.34 --> 3266.14]  I was looking at the,
[3266.18 --> 3266.98]  I was looking at the comments
[3266.98 --> 3269.42]  on the MacBook announcement video
[3269.42 --> 3270.62]  where I was like,
[3270.90 --> 3271.10]  yeah,
[3271.18 --> 3271.32]  oh,
[3271.36 --> 3271.72]  this sucks,
[3271.78 --> 3273.18]  I bought mine at a bad time
[3273.18 --> 3274.86]  and half of it
[3274.86 --> 3275.74]  is people telling me
[3275.74 --> 3276.30]  to return it
[3276.30 --> 3277.34]  because I'm within 10 days,
[3277.48 --> 3278.40]  but guys,
[3278.52 --> 3279.04]  movie magic,
[3279.72 --> 3281.16]  our video came out 10 days ago,
[3281.20 --> 3281.94]  I bought it like
[3281.94 --> 3283.12]  three weeks ago almost,
[3283.22 --> 3283.54]  so no,
[3283.64 --> 3284.38]  I can't return it.
[3285.14 --> 3286.40]  And then the other half
[3286.40 --> 3287.64]  was people telling me,
[3287.68 --> 3287.86]  you know,
[3287.98 --> 3288.54]  suck it up,
[3288.58 --> 3289.02]  crybaby,
[3289.50 --> 3290.44]  you can afford
[3290.44 --> 3291.28]  to buy a new one anyway.
[3291.60 --> 3292.04]  And I can,
[3292.10 --> 3292.90]  but that's not the point,
[3292.94 --> 3294.02]  that doesn't change anything.
[3294.02 --> 3295.34]  That doesn't change the fact
[3295.34 --> 3296.86]  that I bought it at a bad time
[3296.86 --> 3298.76]  because I got a last gen product
[3298.76 --> 3300.90]  days before Apple
[3300.90 --> 3301.74]  announced the new one
[3301.74 --> 3302.48]  and that sucks.
[3302.58 --> 3303.70]  Nobody likes that.
[3304.82 --> 3305.70]  That sucks.
[3306.92 --> 3307.86]  That's the whole point.
[3307.94 --> 3308.12]  Also,
[3308.18 --> 3308.90]  I just needed a hook
[3308.90 --> 3310.08]  for the intro for the video.
[3310.28 --> 3311.00]  Who cares?
[3311.52 --> 3311.70]  Like,
[3311.80 --> 3312.50]  I literally,
[3312.98 --> 3313.78]  when I was shopping
[3313.78 --> 3314.48]  for my MacBook,
[3314.68 --> 3316.42]  bought a last gen one.
[3316.50 --> 3317.28]  I bought an M2
[3317.28 --> 3318.42]  because I knew
[3318.42 --> 3319.16]  that all I was going to do
[3319.16 --> 3320.38]  was word process on it
[3320.38 --> 3321.90]  and it wasn't going to matter anyway.
[3322.66 --> 3322.74]  So,
[3322.74 --> 3323.66]  I'm not actually,
[3323.66 --> 3324.42]  like,
[3324.48 --> 3325.88]  I'm not actually mad.
[3326.28 --> 3326.74]  I just,
[3326.92 --> 3328.86]  I just am saying a thing.
[3328.92 --> 3330.08]  I bought this at the wrong time
[3330.08 --> 3330.76]  and that blows.
[3331.00 --> 3331.90]  It blows for anyone
[3331.90 --> 3332.84]  regardless of the money.
[3334.00 --> 3335.46]  You got roasted recently
[3335.46 --> 3335.90]  at an event
[3335.90 --> 3336.82]  because people were like,
[3336.88 --> 3337.02]  oh,
[3337.10 --> 3337.80]  why do you have the,
[3337.80 --> 3338.06]  like,
[3338.12 --> 3338.94]  crappy iPhone?
[3339.02 --> 3339.14]  Oh,
[3339.16 --> 3339.88]  the 16 plus.
[3339.88 --> 3340.42]  Are you a tech guy?
[3340.74 --> 3340.98]  Yeah.
[3341.14 --> 3341.30]  Yeah,
[3341.32 --> 3341.56]  remember?
[3341.92 --> 3342.10]  Yeah,
[3342.14 --> 3342.58]  because I,
[3342.68 --> 3342.76]  like,
[3342.78 --> 3343.06]  I don't know.
[3343.20 --> 3343.62]  I've always,
[3343.74 --> 3344.24]  as much as,
[3344.34 --> 3345.78]  as much as you are,
[3345.78 --> 3347.02]  what did I say before?
[3347.18 --> 3348.22]  Fairly wealthy or whatever.
[3348.70 --> 3349.16]  I,
[3349.22 --> 3350.26]  I've always appreciated that,
[3350.26 --> 3350.44]  like,
[3350.50 --> 3350.74]  you know,
[3350.94 --> 3351.66]  you'll sit in,
[3352.40 --> 3353.36]  you'll sit in economy,
[3353.50 --> 3353.74]  you'll,
[3353.84 --> 3355.18]  you'll buy the lower end thing,
[3355.26 --> 3356.46]  you'll not scalp stuff.
[3356.58 --> 3356.70]  Like,
[3356.76 --> 3357.10]  there's,
[3357.22 --> 3357.30]  well,
[3357.34 --> 3358.42]  it's the principle of the thing.
[3358.74 --> 3358.76]  There's certain principles
[3358.76 --> 3359.66]  that you've stuck to.
[3359.82 --> 3359.96]  Yeah.
[3359.96 --> 3361.32]  And the thing with this one
[3361.32 --> 3363.60]  is that this is the phone
[3363.60 --> 3365.32]  that I thought made the most sense
[3365.32 --> 3367.98]  in Apple's 16 series lineup.
[3368.82 --> 3369.08]  Yeah,
[3369.10 --> 3370.08]  I can afford a pro.
[3370.40 --> 3371.48]  Of course I can.
[3371.56 --> 3372.38]  Don't be ridiculous.
[3373.22 --> 3373.66]  Literally,
[3373.96 --> 3376.02]  I bought a pro
[3376.02 --> 3377.84]  and a pro max
[3377.84 --> 3379.42]  or whatever the top spec one is.
[3379.48 --> 3380.44]  They're sitting in a warehouse.
[3380.90 --> 3382.08]  I literally bought them.
[3382.74 --> 3383.66]  But this is,
[3383.74 --> 3385.38]  was the one that I wanted to review
[3385.38 --> 3386.34]  the platform on
[3386.34 --> 3387.40]  because I thought
[3387.40 --> 3388.84]  that in terms of
[3388.84 --> 3391.04]  what people should actually
[3391.04 --> 3392.18]  be spending their money on,
[3392.34 --> 3393.42]  this was one that made
[3393.42 --> 3394.30]  a lot more sense.
[3394.70 --> 3395.48]  Those features
[3395.48 --> 3396.80]  on the pro series,
[3398.16 --> 3398.50]  yeah,
[3398.62 --> 3399.78]  I appreciate a higher
[3399.78 --> 3400.74]  refresh rate display.
[3401.16 --> 3401.88]  Of course I do.
[3402.76 --> 3403.72]  And I guess
[3403.72 --> 3404.76]  I'd love to be able
[3404.76 --> 3407.16]  to do a 3D scan of my room
[3407.16 --> 3409.78]  if the situation arises.
[3410.94 --> 3413.14]  And USB 3 transfer speeds
[3413.14 --> 3413.82]  are better
[3413.82 --> 3416.42]  for the once every couple months
[3416.42 --> 3417.74]  that I'll plug in
[3417.74 --> 3418.98]  and I'll do an over-the-cable
[3418.98 --> 3420.14]  backup of my photos
[3420.14 --> 3420.64]  or whatever.
[3421.12 --> 3421.80]  But that's it.
[3422.70 --> 3423.54]  I'm not going to pay
[3423.54 --> 3424.34]  hundreds of dollars
[3424.34 --> 3425.00]  more for that
[3425.00 --> 3426.10]  and I'm especially
[3426.10 --> 3427.44]  not going to recommend
[3427.44 --> 3428.52]  that someone else
[3428.52 --> 3429.76]  pay hundreds of dollars
[3429.76 --> 3430.40]  more for that.
[3430.80 --> 3431.58]  And I think that
[3431.58 --> 3432.66]  reviewing a product,
[3433.00 --> 3433.92]  the way that I would
[3433.92 --> 3434.80]  actually recommend
[3434.80 --> 3435.56]  buying it
[3435.56 --> 3436.92]  is more useful.
[3437.06 --> 3437.56]  I think that's
[3437.56 --> 3438.10]  more meaningful.
[3438.58 --> 3439.30]  It's kind of like
[3439.30 --> 3440.54]  years ago actually.
[3441.32 --> 3442.46]  Anytime we would order
[3442.46 --> 3443.16]  a laptop,
[3443.36 --> 3444.20]  Alex would ask
[3444.20 --> 3445.10]  that instead of ordering
[3445.10 --> 3446.52]  the starting at configuration,
[3446.98 --> 3448.68]  we order the minimum
[3448.68 --> 3450.74]  we would recommend configuration.
[3451.26 --> 3452.28]  So if starting at
[3452.28 --> 3453.46]  had 4 gigs of RAM
[3453.46 --> 3453.92]  or something,
[3454.04 --> 3454.82]  we basically don't
[3454.82 --> 3455.52]  acknowledge that.
[3455.80 --> 3456.20]  And we go,
[3456.48 --> 3458.16]  no, this is not a $999 laptop.
[3458.28 --> 3459.62]  This is a $1299 laptop.
[3459.74 --> 3460.84]  It has 16 gigs of RAM
[3460.84 --> 3461.40]  and etc.
[3462.16 --> 3462.92]  I think,
[3463.26 --> 3463.92]  philosophically,
[3464.18 --> 3464.98]  that that's something
[3464.98 --> 3465.84]  that I can get behind
[3465.84 --> 3466.32]  and it's something
[3466.32 --> 3467.44]  that I'm trying to
[3467.44 --> 3468.60]  continue to be behind.
[3468.90 --> 3469.76]  Yeah, not pretending
[3469.76 --> 3470.58]  I can't afford it.
[3471.38 --> 3471.66]  I mean,
[3471.82 --> 3473.46]  you guys are going to
[3473.46 --> 3474.14]  see some stuff
[3474.14 --> 3474.90]  over the next month
[3474.90 --> 3475.54]  or so of
[3475.54 --> 3478.30]  just stuff
[3478.30 --> 3479.02]  that we could do
[3479.02 --> 3479.78]  for the memes.
[3483.28 --> 3483.88]  You're going to
[3483.88 --> 3484.78]  see some stuff.
[3489.38 --> 3489.78]  Anyway.
[3492.52 --> 3493.24]  The point is,
[3493.26 --> 3494.02]  we have our challenges,
[3494.22 --> 3494.74]  but we're still
[3494.74 --> 3495.72]  doing okay.
[3497.68 --> 3498.08]  No,
[3498.14 --> 3498.86]  it is not going
[3498.86 --> 3499.56]  to be a tech yacht.
[3499.70 --> 3500.50]  I promise
[3500.50 --> 3501.26]  it will not be
[3501.26 --> 3501.82]  a tech yacht.
[3501.82 --> 3503.58]  Tech blimp.
[3504.08 --> 3505.04]  Tech blimp.
[3505.30 --> 3505.86]  Yeah, sure.
[3506.56 --> 3506.92]  Sure.
[3507.28 --> 3508.18]  Let me get right on that.
[3508.18 --> 3508.90]  Put one person
[3508.90 --> 3509.98]  and a laptop on it.
[3511.78 --> 3512.70]  Aw, thanks, Dan.
[3513.30 --> 3514.10]  Oh, right.
[3514.46 --> 3515.18]  Did we ever do
[3515.18 --> 3516.00]  a second merch message?
[3516.36 --> 3516.64]  Yes.
[3517.10 --> 3517.76]  Oh, wonderful.
[3517.86 --> 3518.54]  What am I supposed to do?
[3518.54 --> 3518.74]  That was two.
[3519.30 --> 3520.00]  Let's go straight
[3520.00 --> 3520.46]  into sponsors.
[3520.56 --> 3521.18]  Oh, the show is brought
[3521.18 --> 3521.82]  to you by Squarespace.
[3522.52 --> 3523.48]  You might not like
[3523.48 --> 3524.50]  my fashion sense,
[3525.26 --> 3526.32]  but you got to admit,
[3526.80 --> 3527.52]  our website,
[3527.94 --> 3528.74]  built with our sponsor,
[3528.86 --> 3529.18]  Squarespace,
[3529.76 --> 3530.16]  actually,
[3530.44 --> 3531.34]  pretty tasteful.
[3531.82 --> 3532.72]  They make building
[3532.72 --> 3533.30]  a website
[3533.30 --> 3534.78]  ridiculously easy.
[3534.94 --> 3535.56]  So easy
[3535.56 --> 3536.78]  that our HR team,
[3536.90 --> 3537.42]  that is talent
[3537.42 --> 3538.02]  and culture team,
[3538.18 --> 3539.14]  can quickly post
[3539.14 --> 3539.66]  job listings
[3539.66 --> 3540.86]  without bugging
[3540.86 --> 3541.58]  the IT department.
[3542.26 --> 3543.10]  Applicants can fill
[3543.10 --> 3543.62]  out their info
[3543.62 --> 3544.42]  and upload resumes
[3544.42 --> 3545.06]  and cover letters
[3545.06 --> 3546.16]  directly on the site.
[3546.62 --> 3547.38]  And Squarespace
[3547.38 --> 3548.56]  has tons of stunning
[3548.56 --> 3549.36]  layouts and styling
[3549.36 --> 3550.02]  options that look
[3550.02 --> 3551.32]  amazing on any device.
[3551.82 --> 3552.52]  Not much of a writer?
[3553.06 --> 3553.44]  Well, Squarespace
[3553.44 --> 3554.88]  also offers AI tools
[3554.88 --> 3555.54]  to help you craft
[3555.54 --> 3556.22]  product descriptions
[3556.22 --> 3557.54]  with just a simple
[3557.54 --> 3557.94]  prompt.
[3558.26 --> 3559.22]  They also support
[3559.22 --> 3560.20]  all major credit cards
[3560.20 --> 3561.20]  and other popular
[3561.20 --> 3561.80]  payment methods
[3561.80 --> 3562.80]  making it effortless
[3562.80 --> 3563.98]  to set up your online store.
[3564.42 --> 3564.74]  Need help?
[3565.06 --> 3565.88]  You can message them
[3565.88 --> 3566.62]  through live chat,
[3566.86 --> 3567.74]  browse their video guides,
[3567.80 --> 3568.70]  or even hire
[3568.70 --> 3570.12]  a Squarespace expert.
[3570.64 --> 3571.36]  So start building
[3571.36 --> 3572.40]  your website today
[3572.40 --> 3573.60]  and get 10% off
[3573.60 --> 3574.54]  your first purchase
[3574.54 --> 3575.24]  by visiting
[3575.24 --> 3576.38]  squarespace.com
[3576.38 --> 3577.52]  slash when.
[3578.02 --> 3578.84]  The show is also
[3578.84 --> 3579.70]  brought to you by Vessi.
[3580.12 --> 3581.10]  If you're running out
[3581.10 --> 3582.22]  to grab a new graphics card
[3582.22 --> 3582.68]  this week,
[3583.38 --> 3583.72]  okay,
[3583.72 --> 3585.04]  I get where you're
[3585.04 --> 3585.58]  going with this,
[3585.68 --> 3585.80]  Dennis,
[3585.90 --> 3586.92]  but why am I
[3586.92 --> 3588.22]  holding a GPU already
[3588.22 --> 3589.98]  as I run to get
[3589.98 --> 3590.84]  a graphics card?
[3591.38 --> 3591.82]  Fail.
[3592.10 --> 3592.72]  Absolute fail.
[3593.20 --> 3594.18]  You might as well run
[3594.18 --> 3595.36]  in a pair of Vessis
[3595.36 --> 3596.28]  from our sponsor.
[3597.04 --> 3598.08]  Vessi keeps your socks
[3598.08 --> 3599.02]  dry while staying
[3599.02 --> 3599.52]  breathable,
[3599.74 --> 3599.96]  lightweight,
[3600.18 --> 3600.82]  and stretchy.
[3601.06 --> 3601.84]  And thanks to their
[3601.84 --> 3602.32]  versatility,
[3602.66 --> 3603.62]  I even wore them
[3603.62 --> 3604.76]  to Disneyland last week.
[3604.88 --> 3605.68]  I, of course,
[3605.78 --> 3606.56]  Dennis would get me
[3606.56 --> 3607.14]  in the Vessis.
[3607.60 --> 3608.28]  They're comfortable
[3608.28 --> 3609.36]  and fantastic
[3609.36 --> 3610.26]  for long walks.
[3610.84 --> 3612.04]  It's the lightweightness
[3612.04 --> 3612.76]  that makes the biggest
[3612.76 --> 3613.38]  difference for me,
[3613.38 --> 3613.66]  honestly.
[3613.76 --> 3614.44]  I'm going off script here.
[3614.94 --> 3616.42]  Check out their Stormbursts.
[3616.54 --> 3617.60]  They combine sneaker-like
[3617.60 --> 3618.74]  comfort with boot-level
[3618.74 --> 3619.22]  protection.
[3619.54 --> 3620.52]  Great for spontaneous
[3620.52 --> 3621.36]  weekend adventures,
[3621.62 --> 3622.32]  especially hiking.
[3622.44 --> 3622.56]  I mean,
[3622.58 --> 3623.14]  you'd hate to get your
[3623.14 --> 3623.64]  socks muddy,
[3623.94 --> 3624.58]  or worse,
[3624.86 --> 3625.80]  slip on the trail.
[3626.36 --> 3627.30]  The Stormbursts feature
[3627.30 --> 3628.22]  a rugged outsole
[3628.22 --> 3629.06]  designed for superior
[3629.06 --> 3629.80]  traction on wet,
[3629.90 --> 3630.12]  slippery,
[3630.20 --> 3631.06]  or uneven surfaces,
[3631.30 --> 3632.26]  and Stormburst offers
[3632.26 --> 3632.88]  both high-top
[3632.88 --> 3634.50]  and low-top options.
[3634.78 --> 3635.56]  They have tons
[3635.56 --> 3636.38]  of positive reviews,
[3636.60 --> 3637.32]  and many of our team
[3637.32 --> 3638.16]  members wear Vessis
[3638.16 --> 3638.88]  every day.
[3639.36 --> 3640.72]  So step boldly
[3640.72 --> 3642.02]  into any weather,
[3642.02 --> 3644.46]  with Vessis Stormburst.
[3644.58 --> 3645.26]  You can get your pair
[3645.26 --> 3645.66]  now at
[3645.66 --> 3646.26]  Vessi.com
[3646.26 --> 3647.28]  slash WAN show
[3647.28 --> 3648.62]  to make every step
[3648.62 --> 3649.22]  an adventure
[3649.22 --> 3650.38]  and get an instant
[3650.38 --> 3651.82]  15% off your first
[3651.82 --> 3653.04]  purchase at checkout.
[3654.00 --> 3654.50]  Finally,
[3654.58 --> 3655.24]  the show is brought to you
[3655.24 --> 3655.96]  by Corsair.
[3656.36 --> 3657.22]  Not too pleased
[3657.22 --> 3658.08]  with the PC case
[3658.08 --> 3658.58]  you've got?
[3658.58 --> 3660.54]  Our sponsor,
[3660.68 --> 3662.96]  Corsair's Frame 4000D
[3662.96 --> 3664.38]  might be the case
[3664.38 --> 3665.96]  that'll make you happy.
[3666.58 --> 3667.68]  Its modular design
[3667.68 --> 3669.14]  and InfiniRail fan
[3669.14 --> 3669.88]  mounting system
[3669.88 --> 3670.62]  make building
[3670.62 --> 3671.98]  or upgrading your PC
[3671.98 --> 3674.08]  easier than ever,
[3674.36 --> 3675.28]  offering you the flexibility
[3675.28 --> 3676.36]  to support up to
[3676.36 --> 3678.60]  12 120mm fans
[3678.60 --> 3679.98]  and even dual
[3679.98 --> 3681.92]  360mm radiators.
[3682.80 --> 3683.58]  Got one of them
[3683.58 --> 3685.32]  uber-chonky GPUs?
[3685.68 --> 3686.40]  Well, first of all,
[3686.50 --> 3687.06]  lucky you.
[3687.06 --> 3688.08]  And second of all,
[3688.32 --> 3689.36]  the Frame 4000D
[3689.36 --> 3690.86]  is larger than its predecessor
[3690.86 --> 3692.14]  with plenty of room
[3692.14 --> 3693.60]  to fit your graphics card.
[3694.00 --> 3694.32]  Plus,
[3694.48 --> 3694.96]  it features
[3694.96 --> 3695.70]  reverse connection
[3695.70 --> 3696.36]  motherboard support
[3696.36 --> 3697.76]  and removable internal panels
[3697.76 --> 3698.42]  to keep everything
[3698.42 --> 3699.08]  looking clean.
[3699.78 --> 3700.54]  Built for easy
[3700.54 --> 3701.42]  IQ link integration,
[3701.60 --> 3702.52]  this case lets you manage
[3702.52 --> 3703.52]  all your components
[3703.52 --> 3704.18]  seamlessly.
[3704.58 --> 3705.36]  So check out
[3705.36 --> 3706.88]  the Corsair Frame 4000D
[3706.88 --> 3707.30]  today.
[3707.72 --> 3708.86]  Link in the video
[3708.86 --> 3709.60]  description.
[3711.34 --> 3711.90]  Lies,
[3712.26 --> 3712.98]  damned lies,
[3713.14 --> 3713.96]  and then MSRP.
[3714.86 --> 3715.42]  Bamboozled.
[3715.42 --> 3717.56]  That was the guidance
[3717.56 --> 3718.72]  for the title and thumbnail.
[3718.88 --> 3719.60]  I was just reading it.
[3719.64 --> 3720.38]  Dan put it at the bottom
[3720.38 --> 3720.76]  of the doc
[3720.76 --> 3721.72]  under sponsors.
[3723.12 --> 3723.74]  Okay, Dan.
[3724.90 --> 3725.70]  What do you want to talk
[3725.70 --> 3726.66]  about next, Mr. Luke?
[3728.48 --> 3729.52]  Let's cover
[3729.52 --> 3730.40]  the Firefox
[3730.40 --> 3731.22]  terms rewrite
[3731.22 --> 3731.68]  because
[3731.68 --> 3733.12]  we were a little
[3733.12 --> 3733.90]  kind of unsure
[3733.90 --> 3734.80]  about it last time.
[3734.88 --> 3735.46]  I was pretty sure
[3735.46 --> 3736.44]  that's not what they meant
[3736.44 --> 3737.18]  at the very least,
[3737.22 --> 3737.66]  so I'm happy
[3737.66 --> 3739.28]  that they have done this,
[3739.30 --> 3739.86]  although I haven't
[3739.86 --> 3740.76]  actually reviewed it.
[3740.98 --> 3741.92]  I'm assuming it's fine.
[3742.34 --> 3743.26]  Mozilla has responded
[3743.26 --> 3744.22]  to user backlash
[3744.22 --> 3745.38]  over new Firefox
[3745.38 --> 3746.18]  terms of use
[3746.18 --> 3747.38]  introduced last week,
[3747.68 --> 3748.80]  rewriting the policy
[3748.80 --> 3750.22]  to address
[3750.22 --> 3751.28]  the overly broad
[3751.28 --> 3751.94]  language,
[3752.14 --> 3752.62]  that's one way
[3752.62 --> 3753.14]  of saying it,
[3753.38 --> 3754.36]  used in the original
[3754.36 --> 3754.82]  version,
[3755.64 --> 3756.96]  which, you know,
[3757.06 --> 3757.70]  critics said
[3757.70 --> 3758.64]  the language implied
[3758.64 --> 3759.50]  that Mozilla
[3759.50 --> 3760.70]  was asking for rights
[3760.70 --> 3762.36]  to any data input
[3762.36 --> 3764.28]  or anything
[3764.28 --> 3765.46]  uploaded through Firefox,
[3765.94 --> 3767.12]  which is literally
[3767.12 --> 3767.86]  what it said,
[3768.06 --> 3768.80]  so, yep,
[3769.12 --> 3770.34]  which raised concerns
[3770.34 --> 3771.46]  about data being sold
[3771.46 --> 3772.20]  to advertisers
[3772.20 --> 3773.44]  or used to train AI.
[3774.02 --> 3774.80]  Mozilla claimed
[3774.80 --> 3775.74]  that the new terms
[3775.74 --> 3776.64]  didn't represent
[3776.64 --> 3777.64]  a change in the way
[3777.64 --> 3778.12]  that the company
[3778.12 --> 3778.76]  used data
[3778.76 --> 3779.82]  and that the company's
[3779.82 --> 3780.54]  ability to use
[3780.54 --> 3781.10]  collected data
[3781.10 --> 3781.74]  was still limited
[3781.74 --> 3783.20]  by a separate
[3783.20 --> 3784.54]  Firefox privacy notice.
[3785.02 --> 3785.68]  Two days after
[3785.68 --> 3786.68]  the initial uproar,
[3787.00 --> 3788.28]  Firefox product chief
[3788.28 --> 3789.50]  Ajit Varma
[3789.50 --> 3793.12]  announced that
[3793.12 --> 3794.08]  the terms of use
[3794.08 --> 3795.14]  have been rewritten
[3795.14 --> 3796.76]  to more clearly reflect
[3796.76 --> 3797.64]  the limited scope
[3797.64 --> 3798.72]  of how Firefox
[3798.72 --> 3800.12]  interacts with user data
[3800.12 --> 3801.18]  and the new terms
[3801.18 --> 3802.14]  explicitly state
[3802.14 --> 3802.82]  that Mozilla
[3802.82 --> 3803.64]  does not gain
[3803.64 --> 3804.62]  ownership of
[3804.62 --> 3805.80]  inputted content.
[3806.50 --> 3807.28]  Discussion question,
[3807.36 --> 3808.22]  how diligent are you
[3808.22 --> 3809.10]  about reading terms
[3809.10 --> 3809.60]  and licenses
[3809.60 --> 3810.54]  for the apps you use?
[3811.18 --> 3812.20]  Not very.
[3812.64 --> 3813.72]  I think it depends.
[3813.86 --> 3814.40]  I'm completely honest.
[3814.52 --> 3815.56]  I actually read
[3815.56 --> 3817.36]  an entire contract today
[3817.36 --> 3818.26]  for the first time
[3818.26 --> 3818.82]  in a while.
[3819.34 --> 3820.40]  Oh, I read contracts
[3820.40 --> 3821.06]  all the time.
[3821.28 --> 3821.40]  Oh.
[3821.50 --> 3822.12]  I don't read...
[3822.94 --> 3823.60]  Well, it included
[3823.60 --> 3824.20]  terms of service,
[3824.32 --> 3824.76]  so I guess,
[3825.22 --> 3825.86]  yeah, but,
[3826.08 --> 3826.58]  okay, yeah,
[3826.62 --> 3827.18]  it was more of a
[3827.18 --> 3829.08]  sales contract, so...
[3829.08 --> 3830.00]  Yeah, I read those
[3830.00 --> 3830.34]  for sure.
[3830.40 --> 3831.12]  I read every single
[3831.12 --> 3831.66]  one of those.
[3831.86 --> 3832.66]  I don't...
[3832.66 --> 3833.60]  When I'm signing stuff
[3833.60 --> 3834.62]  on behalf of the company,
[3834.62 --> 3836.40]  I'm a lot more careful.
[3836.90 --> 3837.88]  If I'm using, like,
[3838.74 --> 3839.44]  I don't know,
[3839.52 --> 3840.72]  like, Discord,
[3841.16 --> 3842.68]  I should,
[3842.78 --> 3843.44]  because they're almost
[3843.44 --> 3844.16]  certainly, like,
[3844.42 --> 3845.14]  selling everything,
[3845.34 --> 3846.58]  but I don't.
[3847.80 --> 3848.52]  I don't know.
[3848.72 --> 3849.54]  I'm probably not even
[3849.54 --> 3849.98]  selling it.
[3850.06 --> 3850.28]  I mean,
[3850.48 --> 3851.02]  aren't they...
[3851.02 --> 3851.66]  Just giving it away.
[3851.66 --> 3852.38]  Where are they based?
[3853.72 --> 3855.24]  I think they have
[3855.24 --> 3856.06]  significant company
[3856.06 --> 3856.84]  ownership in China.
[3856.84 --> 3857.84]  Yeah, so they're...
[3857.84 --> 3859.12]  Yeah, so they're just
[3859.12 --> 3859.86]  giving it to the
[3859.86 --> 3860.42]  Chinese government.
[3860.56 --> 3860.66]  You know,
[3860.66 --> 3861.08]  don't even worry
[3861.08 --> 3861.90]  about them selling it.
[3862.48 --> 3864.60]  Yeah, I don't know.
[3867.06 --> 3867.94]  Now I want to know
[3867.94 --> 3869.06]  who does own Discord.
[3869.28 --> 3869.98]  Owned by co-founders?
[3870.04 --> 3871.16]  I could be super wrong.
[3873.04 --> 3874.30]  I thought there was
[3874.30 --> 3876.08]  a significant chunk of...
[3876.32 --> 3877.60]  Oh, 10 cents in there.
[3878.60 --> 3879.82]  It says most likely
[3879.82 --> 3880.84]  has a majority stake.
[3880.92 --> 3881.66]  What does that mean?
[3883.42 --> 3883.82]  Nice.
[3884.56 --> 3885.44]  Can you just tell me
[3885.44 --> 3886.66]  if it actually does or not?
[3886.84 --> 3887.48]  Nice.
[3892.24 --> 3894.16]  I'm not 100% certain
[3894.16 --> 3895.50]  because multiple sources
[3895.50 --> 3896.56]  say most likely.
[3896.96 --> 3897.90]  I don't know
[3897.90 --> 3898.76]  what that means.
[3899.18 --> 3900.16]  Is it banned in China?
[3900.68 --> 3901.88]  Oh, it's blocked in China.
[3903.36 --> 3904.00]  So...
[3904.00 --> 3904.44]  That doesn't mean
[3904.44 --> 3906.44]  it's not funneling information.
[3906.94 --> 3907.86]  That also doesn't mean
[3907.86 --> 3908.60]  that it's not owned
[3908.60 --> 3910.62]  by a Chinese company.
[3911.32 --> 3911.76]  It looks like
[3911.76 --> 3912.26]  there hasn't been
[3912.26 --> 3913.02]  a lot of conversation
[3913.02 --> 3914.04]  about this recently.
[3914.26 --> 3915.28]  So, you know what?
[3915.28 --> 3916.88]  I'm just going to
[3916.88 --> 3917.58]  un...
[3917.58 --> 3918.14]  Allegedly.
[3918.32 --> 3918.50]  There.
[3918.62 --> 3919.20]  I said allegedly.
[3919.50 --> 3920.00]  I don't know.
[3920.28 --> 3920.98]  Well, they have
[3920.98 --> 3922.10]  some amount of stake.
[3922.28 --> 3923.18]  Tencent seems to have
[3923.18 --> 3923.94]  some amount of stake
[3923.94 --> 3924.42]  in the company,
[3924.54 --> 3925.84]  but it's not very clear
[3925.84 --> 3926.30]  how much.
[3928.32 --> 3928.78]  I don't know.
[3929.18 --> 3930.24]  Anyways, either way.
[3930.24 --> 3932.64]  Yeah, I read
[3932.64 --> 3933.92]  and have raised issues
[3933.92 --> 3935.58]  with actually many times
[3935.58 --> 3937.68]  contracts that the company
[3937.68 --> 3938.62]  has signed,
[3939.02 --> 3940.94]  including one very intense one
[3940.94 --> 3942.24]  with...
[3942.24 --> 3944.30]  Yeah, I'll say it.
[3944.34 --> 3945.52]  One with a sponsor
[3945.52 --> 3948.98]  where they were trying
[3948.98 --> 3950.74]  to give us information early,
[3950.90 --> 3951.54]  which would have been
[3951.54 --> 3952.10]  very helpful.
[3952.64 --> 3953.40]  But I don't even know
[3953.40 --> 3954.02]  if you know about this,
[3954.24 --> 3955.48]  but the contract included
[3955.48 --> 3956.68]  a line like three quarters
[3956.68 --> 3957.12]  through it
[3957.12 --> 3958.32]  that said that we couldn't
[3958.32 --> 3959.78]  say any disparaging comments
[3959.78 --> 3960.52]  about them ever.
[3961.64 --> 3962.34]  And I was like,
[3962.40 --> 3964.04]  no.
[3964.58 --> 3965.20]  There's like,
[3965.30 --> 3966.40]  there's no way
[3966.40 --> 3967.42]  we're signing this.
[3967.50 --> 3968.50]  No, I think I did hear
[3968.50 --> 3968.92]  this one.
[3969.24 --> 3970.68]  I think I did hear this one.
[3971.38 --> 3972.46]  That would have been hilarious.
[3972.96 --> 3973.76]  We would have just...
[3973.76 --> 3974.70]  We would have just
[3974.70 --> 3975.92]  un...
[3975.92 --> 3976.50]  That it...
[3976.50 --> 3977.20]  Oh, we would have had to.
[3977.28 --> 3977.84]  Yeah, we would have had
[3977.84 --> 3978.90]  to just say whatever we want
[3978.90 --> 3979.94]  because that's not how this works.
[3979.94 --> 3980.24]  It doesn't work.
[3980.56 --> 3980.98]  We would have had to
[3980.98 --> 3981.54]  break contracts.
[3981.64 --> 3982.06]  That's hilarious.
[3982.06 --> 3982.88]  Yeah, I sent it back to them
[3982.88 --> 3983.20]  and they're like,
[3983.28 --> 3984.62]  oh, we're never going
[3984.62 --> 3985.40]  to do anything.
[3985.56 --> 3985.76]  Yeah.
[3985.76 --> 3986.08]  I was like,
[3986.16 --> 3987.26]  no, you're removing this.
[3987.66 --> 3988.70]  Then you'll have no problem
[3988.70 --> 3989.44]  removing it.
[3990.10 --> 3990.50]  Exactly.
[3990.70 --> 3990.88]  Yeah.
[3992.28 --> 3993.20]  Oh, that's great.
[3993.44 --> 3994.86]  Which, if I remember correctly,
[3995.52 --> 3996.60]  I don't know that they did.
[3996.86 --> 3997.42]  No, they didn't.
[3997.48 --> 3998.26]  I don't think they removed
[3998.26 --> 3998.78]  it ultimately.
[3999.32 --> 3999.66]  Yeah.
[3999.84 --> 4000.98]  So we never signed it.
[4001.06 --> 4001.22]  Yeah.
[4001.80 --> 4002.46]  Now, man,
[4002.46 --> 4003.28]  there's been all kinds
[4003.28 --> 4004.14]  of stuff like that
[4004.14 --> 4005.64]  that's like stuff
[4005.64 --> 4006.42]  that we'd love to do
[4006.42 --> 4007.40]  that would be beneficial,
[4007.78 --> 4008.62]  mutually beneficial.
[4008.94 --> 4010.06]  Like we had a...
[4010.06 --> 4011.50]  We had a laptop company.
[4011.50 --> 4011.94]  Yeah.
[4012.78 --> 4013.70]  Framework disclosure,
[4013.88 --> 4014.56]  but it wasn't framework,
[4014.72 --> 4015.12]  so whatever.
[4015.52 --> 4016.64]  But we had a laptop company
[4016.64 --> 4017.56]  come to us recently
[4017.56 --> 4018.04]  and say,
[4018.18 --> 4018.42]  hey,
[4018.88 --> 4020.14]  like we'd love
[4020.14 --> 4021.56]  to integrate more deeply
[4021.56 --> 4022.36]  with you guys,
[4022.68 --> 4024.22]  get feedback on branding
[4024.22 --> 4025.44]  and product design
[4025.44 --> 4027.30]  and, you know,
[4027.58 --> 4028.92]  give you guys early looks
[4028.92 --> 4029.30]  at stuff
[4029.30 --> 4030.46]  so that you can kind of
[4030.46 --> 4031.72]  help guide us
[4031.72 --> 4032.86]  because realistically,
[4032.86 --> 4033.90]  we really do appreciate
[4033.90 --> 4034.54]  your feedback
[4034.54 --> 4036.24]  as independent media,
[4036.46 --> 4037.80]  but the reality of it is
[4037.80 --> 4038.70]  by the time we get it,
[4038.76 --> 4039.58]  the product's done,
[4039.80 --> 4041.10]  so there's not really
[4041.10 --> 4042.12]  anything we can do about it.
[4042.50 --> 4042.78]  You know,
[4042.88 --> 4043.88]  how about this?
[4043.90 --> 4045.04]  And I had the business team
[4045.04 --> 4045.56]  bring it to me
[4045.56 --> 4046.92]  and I basically was like,
[4047.18 --> 4050.28]  I don't see what planet
[4050.28 --> 4051.36]  this can work on
[4051.36 --> 4052.60]  because...
[4052.60 --> 4053.70]  Oh, I'm making the exact
[4053.70 --> 4054.20]  same gesture
[4054.20 --> 4055.66]  as my doppelganger here.
[4056.00 --> 4056.20]  Bleh!
[4056.44 --> 4056.78]  Bleh!
[4057.88 --> 4059.40]  I don't see what planet
[4059.40 --> 4060.16]  this can work on
[4060.16 --> 4061.62]  because either
[4061.62 --> 4062.58]  we do this for free,
[4062.68 --> 4063.74]  which is a complete
[4063.74 --> 4064.94]  fucking waste of our time
[4064.94 --> 4065.82]  because we're busy
[4065.82 --> 4067.04]  and we have a lot to do.
[4067.58 --> 4067.76]  You know,
[4067.78 --> 4068.32]  it's not that we don't
[4068.32 --> 4069.02]  want to be helpful
[4069.02 --> 4069.50]  or whatever,
[4069.62 --> 4070.30]  it's just that like
[4070.30 --> 4071.54]  we can't make it a habit
[4071.54 --> 4073.42]  to just do consulting
[4073.42 --> 4074.66]  for free for everybody.
[4074.84 --> 4075.52]  That's ridiculous.
[4076.40 --> 4077.60]  So that's not an option
[4077.60 --> 4079.32]  and we can't take money for it
[4079.32 --> 4081.14]  because even if
[4081.14 --> 4082.54]  they gave us a contract
[4082.54 --> 4083.54]  that was like,
[4083.64 --> 4083.98]  oh yeah,
[4084.02 --> 4084.66]  you could totally
[4084.66 --> 4085.88]  say whatever you want,
[4086.40 --> 4087.96]  we actually wouldn't be able to
[4087.96 --> 4089.22]  because anything
[4089.22 --> 4092.58]  that we were bound by
[4092.58 --> 4093.86]  that didn't make it
[4093.86 --> 4094.86]  into the final product,
[4094.86 --> 4097.36]  like any of that decision-making process
[4097.36 --> 4099.42]  that we're privy to,
[4099.76 --> 4101.40]  now because we're privy to it,
[4101.64 --> 4102.28]  we wouldn't be able
[4102.28 --> 4103.44]  to speculate on it
[4103.44 --> 4108.86]  without sort of violating the,
[4109.76 --> 4110.14]  I mean,
[4110.18 --> 4111.40]  at least the spirit
[4111.40 --> 4112.02]  of the agreement.
[4112.26 --> 4112.84]  Like you can't,
[4113.40 --> 4114.14]  like we couldn't,
[4115.38 --> 4115.64]  man,
[4115.74 --> 4116.78]  imagine if we were doing
[4116.78 --> 4119.38]  a review of this MacBook
[4119.38 --> 4120.72]  and I'm going to use
[4120.72 --> 4121.80]  a far-fetched example
[4121.80 --> 4122.50]  so that I'm really
[4122.50 --> 4123.26]  not giving any hints
[4123.26 --> 4124.08]  because I promise you
[4124.08 --> 4124.90]  it wasn't Apple
[4124.90 --> 4125.88]  talking to us about this.
[4126.26 --> 4127.08]  Apple doesn't talk to me.
[4127.52 --> 4128.46]  If I was doing a review
[4128.46 --> 4129.50]  of this MacBook,
[4130.02 --> 4132.18]  like imagine me knowing
[4132.18 --> 4134.14]  that I advised them
[4134.14 --> 4136.84]  that I do actually
[4136.84 --> 4137.50]  like the keyboard.
[4137.64 --> 4137.96]  So again,
[4138.00 --> 4138.78]  I'm going to use an example
[4138.78 --> 4139.46]  that is not real.
[4140.10 --> 4141.46]  Imagine if I advised them
[4141.46 --> 4142.40]  that the keyboard sucked
[4142.40 --> 4143.48]  and they shipped
[4143.48 --> 4144.40]  that sucky keyboard
[4144.40 --> 4145.18]  in spite of me saying
[4145.18 --> 4146.32]  that I didn't like it.
[4146.48 --> 4147.70]  So now I'm sitting here
[4147.70 --> 4148.84]  doing my editorial review
[4148.84 --> 4149.88]  and I'm like,
[4149.96 --> 4150.10]  yeah,
[4150.10 --> 4151.56]  I told them this keyboard sucked,
[4151.56 --> 4153.48]  but they shipped this anyway
[4153.48 --> 4155.10]  so they're especially stupid.
[4155.38 --> 4156.16]  Imagine the strain
[4156.16 --> 4156.76]  that that would put
[4156.76 --> 4157.50]  on the relationship
[4157.50 --> 4158.92]  even if I was allowed
[4158.92 --> 4159.46]  to say that.
[4159.54 --> 4160.06]  That's like,
[4160.88 --> 4162.08]  you're just in a position
[4162.08 --> 4163.06]  where things are like
[4163.06 --> 4164.38]  bizarre,
[4164.96 --> 4165.28]  you know?
[4165.72 --> 4165.90]  Yeah.
[4165.98 --> 4167.64]  Like it's not even like,
[4167.88 --> 4168.96]  it's not even conflict
[4168.96 --> 4169.66]  of interest.
[4169.68 --> 4170.86]  It's just conflict.
[4171.20 --> 4171.76]  That's just,
[4172.00 --> 4173.88]  that just doesn't work.
[4174.74 --> 4176.36]  So I think that's come up
[4176.36 --> 4177.84]  probably half a dozen times
[4177.84 --> 4178.36]  over the years
[4178.36 --> 4178.88]  and every time
[4178.88 --> 4179.90]  I just kind of kick it back
[4179.90 --> 4180.76]  and just kind of go like,
[4180.82 --> 4181.36]  how does this,
[4181.70 --> 4182.68]  how does this make any sense?
[4182.76 --> 4183.66]  It doesn't make any sense.
[4184.16 --> 4185.56]  In the particular example
[4185.56 --> 4186.68]  that I laid out as well,
[4186.78 --> 4187.60]  the thing that was
[4187.60 --> 4188.36]  kind of funny to me
[4188.36 --> 4189.42]  was that they were,
[4189.74 --> 4190.30]  it was,
[4190.38 --> 4191.56]  it was clearly more,
[4191.94 --> 4193.36]  if we ignored the thing
[4193.36 --> 4194.20]  that I had to sign,
[4194.30 --> 4195.86]  it was clearly more beneficial
[4195.86 --> 4196.42]  to them.
[4196.64 --> 4197.32]  Like the thing
[4197.32 --> 4198.14]  that we would have been doing
[4198.14 --> 4199.04]  would have been better
[4199.04 --> 4199.68]  for them
[4199.68 --> 4201.10]  than it would have been for us.
[4201.40 --> 4202.64]  So it was just kind of stupid,
[4202.80 --> 4203.66]  but I think,
[4203.82 --> 4204.14]  I think,
[4204.18 --> 4204.40]  you know,
[4204.44 --> 4206.12]  they're just a pretty big company
[4206.12 --> 4207.60]  and they have one boilerplate thing
[4207.60 --> 4208.14]  and their lawyers
[4208.14 --> 4209.30]  just didn't want to change it.
[4209.30 --> 4210.02]  So like the person
[4210.02 --> 4211.10]  I was talking to understood.
[4211.34 --> 4211.94]  I get it.
[4212.02 --> 4212.34]  But they,
[4212.52 --> 4213.64]  they couldn't get the legal team
[4213.64 --> 4213.88]  to change it.
[4213.88 --> 4215.14]  It probably would have cost 20 grand
[4215.14 --> 4216.72]  because they probably would have had
[4216.72 --> 4217.96]  to take the entire agreement
[4217.96 --> 4219.10]  back to the law firm
[4219.10 --> 4219.56]  and like,
[4220.10 --> 4221.16]  this is why I don't like
[4221.16 --> 4222.46]  involving lawyers and things
[4222.46 --> 4223.46]  and if you're a lawyer,
[4223.72 --> 4223.96]  whatever,
[4224.12 --> 4225.08]  like nothing personal,
[4225.24 --> 4225.60]  you got,
[4225.86 --> 4226.76]  you got your expertise,
[4227.00 --> 4228.06]  you got to be paid for that,
[4228.12 --> 4229.00]  you got a job to do,
[4229.08 --> 4229.66]  I get it.
[4231.26 --> 4232.72]  But I don't like talking to you.
[4232.72 --> 4233.10]  But dang, dude.
[4233.16 --> 4234.20]  I don't like talking to you.
[4234.28 --> 4234.48]  Me neither.
[4235.82 --> 4236.18]  Yeah.
[4236.18 --> 4238.30]  Sorry.
[4238.64 --> 4239.02]  You know,
[4239.26 --> 4239.82]  I'm sorry.
[4240.14 --> 4240.94]  Nothing personal.
[4241.62 --> 4242.84]  What do we want to talk about next?
[4245.72 --> 4247.88]  Should we do the dig thing?
[4248.24 --> 4248.48]  Yeah,
[4248.50 --> 4249.72]  let's do the dig thing.
[4250.38 --> 4251.24]  Dig's coming back?
[4251.38 --> 4251.56]  What?
[4252.36 --> 4253.12]  Dig founder,
[4253.24 --> 4253.88]  Kevin Rose
[4253.88 --> 4255.08]  and Reddit co-founder,
[4255.48 --> 4257.16]  Alexis Ohanian,
[4257.60 --> 4257.86]  sure,
[4258.22 --> 4259.18]  have acquired dig
[4259.18 --> 4259.88]  with the intent
[4259.88 --> 4261.30]  of reviving the platform
[4261.30 --> 4262.52]  with a fresh vision
[4262.52 --> 4263.62]  to restore the spirit
[4263.62 --> 4264.26]  of discovery
[4264.26 --> 4265.62]  and genuine community
[4265.62 --> 4267.16]  that made the early web
[4267.16 --> 4268.80]  a fun and exciting place to be.
[4269.02 --> 4269.68]  Good luck with that.
[4269.94 --> 4270.40]  I would love it
[4270.40 --> 4271.26]  if you can accomplish it.
[4271.78 --> 4273.18]  Dig launched in 2004
[4273.18 --> 4274.16]  with its innovative
[4274.16 --> 4276.20]  user-curated content system
[4276.20 --> 4277.36]  and quickly became
[4277.36 --> 4278.92]  the homepage of the internet
[4278.92 --> 4280.36]  for more than 40 million
[4280.36 --> 4282.88]  unique visitors a month.
[4283.14 --> 4285.04]  After a very poorly received
[4285.04 --> 4286.18]  redesign in 2010,
[4286.56 --> 4287.62]  users abandoned the site
[4287.62 --> 4288.82]  in favor of Reddit.
[4289.24 --> 4289.98]  And by 2012,
[4290.40 --> 4291.28]  Dig's unique visitors
[4291.28 --> 4292.84]  count was down 90%
[4292.84 --> 4293.50]  from its peak
[4293.50 --> 4294.86]  and the site
[4294.86 --> 4296.00]  and assets were sold off
[4296.00 --> 4297.06]  for less than $16 million.
[4297.38 --> 4298.24]  Isn't that crazy?
[4298.74 --> 4299.90]  To think like...
[4299.90 --> 4300.62]  Absolutely crazy.
[4300.62 --> 4302.62]  Reddit was nothing
[4302.62 --> 4305.04]  and Dig was everything
[4305.04 --> 4307.00]  and practically overnight.
[4307.84 --> 4308.62]  That was it.
[4308.66 --> 4310.08]  That's how fast platforms
[4310.08 --> 4311.00]  used to come and go
[4311.00 --> 4311.38]  and now,
[4311.68 --> 4312.18]  I mean,
[4312.20 --> 4313.46]  you've talked about this extensively.
[4313.62 --> 4314.36]  We don't have to reopen
[4314.36 --> 4315.08]  this can of worms,
[4315.18 --> 4316.08]  but it feels like
[4316.08 --> 4318.56]  things are so permanent.
[4319.64 --> 4320.46]  The momentum
[4320.46 --> 4321.68]  is enormous
[4321.68 --> 4323.02]  for platforms now.
[4323.12 --> 4323.30]  Anyway,
[4323.44 --> 4323.74]  carry on.
[4323.82 --> 4323.94]  Sorry.
[4324.34 --> 4325.50]  The moats are huge.
[4325.62 --> 4325.76]  Like,
[4325.82 --> 4326.72]  anyone attempting
[4326.72 --> 4327.56]  to attack YouTube
[4327.56 --> 4328.56]  is going to lose.
[4328.74 --> 4328.88]  Like,
[4328.92 --> 4329.18]  it just,
[4329.70 --> 4330.02]  I don't know,
[4330.06 --> 4330.70]  it is what it is.
[4331.18 --> 4331.94]  Even TikTok,
[4332.14 --> 4332.26]  like,
[4332.30 --> 4333.48]  they're winning in a space,
[4333.82 --> 4335.20]  but they didn't win,
[4335.24 --> 4335.40]  like,
[4335.46 --> 4336.72]  YouTube-style VODs.
[4336.72 --> 4337.04]  No.
[4337.46 --> 4337.62]  And...
[4337.62 --> 4337.98]  Shorts.
[4338.14 --> 4338.68]  And even then,
[4338.74 --> 4339.24]  YouTube shorts
[4339.24 --> 4340.02]  are taking off.
[4340.02 --> 4340.84]  More importantly,
[4341.08 --> 4342.00]  they didn't win
[4342.00 --> 4343.00]  the profitability
[4343.00 --> 4344.96]  of traditional VOD.
[4345.78 --> 4345.96]  Yep.
[4346.02 --> 4346.20]  Like,
[4346.26 --> 4347.56]  I'm sure TikTok makes money,
[4347.66 --> 4348.20]  but the creators
[4348.20 --> 4349.06]  sure as heck don't.
[4349.68 --> 4349.92]  Yep.
[4351.26 --> 4352.48]  In a press release,
[4352.84 --> 4353.96]  Ohanian summed up
[4353.96 --> 4355.30]  the plans for the new site,
[4355.38 --> 4355.58]  stating,
[4355.66 --> 4356.44]  Kevin and I are here
[4356.44 --> 4357.52]  to build something better
[4357.52 --> 4358.98]  than what social platforms
[4358.98 --> 4359.80]  are offering today.
[4360.30 --> 4361.14]  AI should handle
[4361.14 --> 4361.96]  the grunt work
[4361.96 --> 4362.96]  in the background
[4362.96 --> 4363.90]  while humans focus
[4363.90 --> 4364.88]  on what they do best,
[4365.10 --> 4366.12]  building real connections.
[4366.60 --> 4367.26]  No one dreams
[4367.26 --> 4368.18]  of spending their day
[4368.18 --> 4369.26]  hunting down spam
[4369.26 --> 4370.66]  or playing content police.
[4370.66 --> 4371.74]  They want to create,
[4371.98 --> 4372.24]  connect,
[4372.34 --> 4373.46]  and build thriving communities.
[4374.00 --> 4375.12]  And I'm all in
[4375.12 --> 4376.16]  on this chapter.
[4378.74 --> 4379.18]  Interesting.
[4379.62 --> 4380.00]  So, like,
[4380.12 --> 4381.70]  AI content curation
[4381.70 --> 4382.26]  with humans
[4382.26 --> 4383.30]  just commenting on it,
[4383.36 --> 4383.56]  maybe?
[4384.88 --> 4385.70]  I don't know.
[4386.32 --> 4387.28]  It sounds like
[4387.28 --> 4388.08]  from that description
[4388.08 --> 4388.60]  that humans
[4388.60 --> 4389.42]  aren't even posting
[4389.42 --> 4389.98]  the links.
[4393.56 --> 4394.50]  I should handle
[4394.50 --> 4395.14]  the grunt work
[4395.14 --> 4395.82]  in the background
[4395.82 --> 4396.30]  while humans
[4396.30 --> 4397.30]  think they do best,
[4397.30 --> 4398.38]  building real connections.
[4399.02 --> 4399.56]  No one dreams
[4399.56 --> 4400.24]  of spending their day
[4400.24 --> 4401.42]  hunting down spam
[4401.42 --> 4402.50]  or playing content police.
[4402.88 --> 4404.94]  So, no active moderation?
[4405.12 --> 4405.72]  Yeah, I don't know
[4405.72 --> 4406.30]  what that means.
[4406.60 --> 4407.14]  I don't know
[4407.14 --> 4407.74]  what that means either.
[4407.84 --> 4408.58]  And because I didn't
[4408.58 --> 4409.18]  know what that meant,
[4409.40 --> 4410.58]  I went to their website
[4410.58 --> 4411.64]  and I learned
[4411.64 --> 4412.72]  nothing
[4412.72 --> 4413.84]  at all.
[4414.78 --> 4415.36]  It is
[4415.36 --> 4417.14]  completely
[4417.14 --> 4418.56]  useless.
[4422.78 --> 4423.34]  I mean,
[4423.36 --> 4424.06]  that makes sense
[4424.06 --> 4424.70]  because it's not like
[4424.70 --> 4425.50]  they've had time
[4425.50 --> 4426.36]  to work on anything
[4426.36 --> 4426.90]  yet.
[4427.10 --> 4428.18]  It's just an announcement
[4428.18 --> 4428.88]  of an intent
[4428.88 --> 4429.88]  to work on something.
[4430.24 --> 4431.58]  no explainer
[4431.58 --> 4432.40]  of, you know,
[4432.42 --> 4433.14]  what it is.
[4433.22 --> 4433.54]  I don't know.
[4433.78 --> 4434.66]  They have a little button
[4434.66 --> 4435.66]  that every time you click it,
[4435.72 --> 4436.64]  it iterates by one.
[4436.84 --> 4437.04]  I mean,
[4437.06 --> 4438.14]  I'd be down to give it a shot,
[4438.28 --> 4438.86]  but I just...
[4438.86 --> 4439.64]  And it's not a lot.
[4439.84 --> 4441.38]  Oh, there's so much...
[4441.38 --> 4442.48]  There's so much
[4442.48 --> 4443.58]  of why I use Reddit
[4443.58 --> 4445.00]  is because of
[4445.00 --> 4445.88]  what's already there,
[4446.02 --> 4447.38]  not because of
[4447.38 --> 4448.42]  what I want
[4448.42 --> 4448.92]  to be there
[4448.92 --> 4449.44]  in the future.
[4449.44 --> 4452.10]  and that's true
[4452.10 --> 4453.10]  of YouTube as well,
[4453.18 --> 4453.66]  which was another
[4453.66 --> 4454.28]  great example
[4454.28 --> 4454.74]  you gave
[4454.74 --> 4455.40]  of just like
[4455.40 --> 4455.90]  a platform
[4455.90 --> 4456.90]  with enormous
[4456.90 --> 4457.40]  inertia.
[4459.00 --> 4459.16]  Yeah.
[4460.12 --> 4460.54]  Conceptually,
[4460.62 --> 4461.52]  what is the difference
[4461.52 --> 4462.30]  between inertia
[4462.30 --> 4462.90]  and momentum?
[4462.90 --> 4465.00]  I guess momentum
[4465.00 --> 4466.00]  has to actually
[4466.00 --> 4466.90]  have...
[4467.90 --> 4468.90]  Well,
[4470.16 --> 4470.68]  momentum,
[4471.18 --> 4471.96]  but inertia
[4471.96 --> 4472.66]  is always
[4472.66 --> 4473.74]  an innate
[4473.74 --> 4473.90]  quantity.
[4473.90 --> 4474.52]  quantity?
[4475.96 --> 4476.20]  Anyway,
[4476.34 --> 4476.78]  it doesn't matter.
[4478.48 --> 4479.24]  Different side,
[4479.34 --> 4479.72]  same coin?
[4482.34 --> 4482.86]  Momentum
[4482.86 --> 4483.34]  is defined
[4483.34 --> 4483.96]  as a tendency
[4483.96 --> 4485.02]  of a body
[4485.02 --> 4486.12]  to remain in motion.
[4486.94 --> 4487.32]  Inertia
[4487.32 --> 4487.96]  is defined
[4487.96 --> 4488.70]  as a tendency
[4488.70 --> 4489.28]  for a body
[4489.28 --> 4490.00]  to oppose
[4490.00 --> 4491.02]  the change
[4491.02 --> 4491.94]  in its position.
[4494.24 --> 4494.76]  So,
[4494.84 --> 4495.48]  they're the same thing.
[4497.16 --> 4497.68]  No.
[4498.36 --> 4498.82]  No.
[4500.42 --> 4501.20]  I mean,
[4501.66 --> 4502.22]  they sound like
[4502.22 --> 4503.06]  the same value
[4503.06 --> 4503.80]  once you calculate
[4503.80 --> 4504.48]  In simple words,
[4504.58 --> 4505.38]  momentum is your
[4505.38 --> 4506.42]  force or speed
[4506.42 --> 4506.98]  of movement
[4506.98 --> 4508.24]  and inertia
[4508.24 --> 4509.12]  is what keeps
[4509.12 --> 4509.66]  you going.
[4514.18 --> 4514.66]  What,
[4514.74 --> 4515.00]  wouldn't your
[4515.00 --> 4515.60]  speed of movement
[4515.60 --> 4516.20]  and your mass
[4516.20 --> 4516.76]  be what keeps
[4516.76 --> 4517.60]  you going?
[4518.02 --> 4518.22]  No,
[4518.26 --> 4518.52]  because if you
[4518.52 --> 4519.06]  had an elephant
[4519.06 --> 4519.90]  that was stationary,
[4520.30 --> 4521.28]  it would have
[4521.28 --> 4522.02]  enormous inertia
[4522.02 --> 4522.72]  but no momentum.
[4522.94 --> 4523.10]  It has a lot
[4523.10 --> 4523.58]  of inertia.
[4524.50 --> 4524.98]  But then,
[4525.36 --> 4526.38]  if I wanted to,
[4527.92 --> 4529.16]  I guess we could...
[4529.16 --> 4529.34]  Okay,
[4529.42 --> 4530.28]  so only if it's
[4530.28 --> 4531.38]  completely stationary,
[4531.70 --> 4532.62]  inertness,
[4532.84 --> 4533.56]  then it's inertia.
[4533.80 --> 4536.14]  I guess that kind of,
[4536.14 --> 4536.66]  I can kind of get
[4536.66 --> 4537.16]  behind that.
[4538.46 --> 4539.26]  If you had a very
[4539.26 --> 4540.22]  tiny thing that was
[4540.22 --> 4541.28]  moving very fast,
[4541.38 --> 4542.32]  it would have a high
[4542.32 --> 4542.84]  inertia.
[4542.84 --> 4551.82]  I don't think that's
[4551.82 --> 4552.04]  right.
[4552.96 --> 4553.80]  I'm not going to worry
[4553.80 --> 4554.20]  about it.
[4554.40 --> 4554.82]  I'm bored.
[4556.04 --> 4557.40]  The best subscription
[4557.40 --> 4558.86]  ever just got more
[4558.86 --> 4559.40]  affordable.
[4560.22 --> 4561.18]  YouTube Premium
[4561.18 --> 4562.18]  Lite.
[4563.04 --> 4564.44]  On March 5th,
[4564.58 --> 4565.18]  YouTube announced
[4565.18 --> 4565.84]  that they're adding
[4565.84 --> 4567.20]  a cheaper tier
[4567.20 --> 4568.26]  to the YouTube
[4568.26 --> 4569.02]  Premium lineup
[4569.02 --> 4570.22]  called Premium Lite.
[4570.22 --> 4572.30]  It will cost $8 a month
[4572.30 --> 4573.64]  instead of $14.
[4574.16 --> 4574.34]  But,
[4574.52 --> 4575.56]  there are some
[4575.56 --> 4575.98]  differences.
[4576.56 --> 4577.50]  You will not
[4577.50 --> 4578.40]  get access to
[4578.40 --> 4579.60]  downloading or
[4579.60 --> 4580.74]  background play
[4580.74 --> 4581.32]  on mobile.
[4581.32 --> 4582.46]  No background play?
[4582.88 --> 4583.38]  Okay.
[4584.66 --> 4585.76]  YouTube music,
[4586.38 --> 4587.34]  music videos,
[4587.92 --> 4588.30]  shorts,
[4588.30 --> 4589.60]  and the homepage
[4589.60 --> 4590.88]  will still get
[4590.88 --> 4591.48]  ads.
[4592.42 --> 4593.54]  And they also
[4593.54 --> 4594.38]  have a footnote
[4594.38 --> 4595.08]  saying that
[4595.08 --> 4597.06]  most videos
[4597.06 --> 4598.40]  are ad-free,
[4598.82 --> 4599.60]  such as gaming,
[4599.80 --> 4600.02]  fashion,
[4600.18 --> 4600.42]  beauty,
[4600.66 --> 4601.04]  news,
[4601.22 --> 4602.34]  and more.
[4603.18 --> 4603.82]  So,
[4604.06 --> 4605.14]  what am I actually
[4605.14 --> 4605.74]  getting?
[4605.74 --> 4606.30]  What are you paying for?
[4606.30 --> 4607.16]  Well,
[4607.20 --> 4607.54]  you get
[4607.54 --> 4609.46]  no in-video
[4609.46 --> 4610.70]  mid-roll
[4610.70 --> 4611.42]  and pre-roll
[4611.42 --> 4611.88]  ads,
[4611.94 --> 4612.72]  it sounds like,
[4613.24 --> 4614.66]  in most
[4614.66 --> 4615.70]  videos,
[4615.84 --> 4616.40]  but that does
[4616.40 --> 4617.28]  not include
[4617.28 --> 4618.40]  music videos,
[4619.46 --> 4619.88]  shorts,
[4620.26 --> 4621.64]  or the homepage,
[4622.30 --> 4622.82]  and you don't
[4622.82 --> 4623.68]  get YouTube music.
[4623.86 --> 4624.46]  This actually
[4624.46 --> 4625.04]  sounds like a
[4625.04 --> 4625.56]  terrible deal,
[4625.62 --> 4625.96]  and you should
[4625.96 --> 4626.42]  just get the
[4626.42 --> 4627.16]  regular premium.
[4627.60 --> 4628.68]  I also hate
[4628.68 --> 4629.78]  that it's
[4629.78 --> 4631.04]  unclear,
[4631.50 --> 4631.98]  so it feels
[4631.98 --> 4632.42]  like they can
[4632.42 --> 4633.20]  change it on me
[4633.20 --> 4633.66]  without even
[4633.66 --> 4634.48]  updating the terms.
[4634.68 --> 4634.82]  Well,
[4634.86 --> 4635.46]  this basically
[4635.46 --> 4636.22]  sounds like
[4636.22 --> 4636.56]  they just
[4636.56 --> 4637.04]  can't afford
[4637.04 --> 4637.44]  the music
[4637.44 --> 4637.88]  licensing,
[4638.56 --> 4639.10]  because that's
[4639.10 --> 4639.52]  why you can't
[4639.52 --> 4639.98]  have background
[4639.98 --> 4640.20]  play.
[4640.28 --> 4640.60]  That's why
[4640.60 --> 4641.16]  background play
[4641.16 --> 4641.50]  costs,
[4641.56 --> 4642.10]  because it's
[4642.10 --> 4642.66]  instead of
[4642.66 --> 4643.18]  Spotify,
[4643.60 --> 4643.82]  right?
[4643.90 --> 4644.40]  You can just
[4644.40 --> 4645.12]  have YouTube
[4645.12 --> 4645.96]  music videos
[4645.96 --> 4646.38]  playing in the
[4646.38 --> 4646.64]  background.
[4647.44 --> 4647.92]  So,
[4648.00 --> 4648.82]  I get it,
[4649.12 --> 4649.86]  but also it
[4649.86 --> 4650.28]  just seems
[4650.28 --> 4651.18]  like not that
[4651.18 --> 4651.68]  compelling a
[4651.68 --> 4652.14]  value add,
[4652.20 --> 4653.54]  because I
[4653.54 --> 4654.32]  don't know if
[4654.32 --> 4654.72]  I know a
[4654.72 --> 4655.58]  single adult
[4655.58 --> 4656.46]  working person
[4656.46 --> 4657.02]  in my life
[4657.02 --> 4657.44]  that doesn't
[4657.44 --> 4658.66]  have a
[4658.66 --> 4659.00]  Spotify,
[4659.44 --> 4659.86]  or YouTube
[4659.86 --> 4660.26]  Music,
[4660.48 --> 4660.82]  or Apple
[4660.82 --> 4661.20]  Music,
[4661.44 --> 4661.92]  or Tidal,
[4662.08 --> 4662.48]  or whatever,
[4662.58 --> 4663.00]  like a music
[4663.00 --> 4663.42]  subscription.
[4663.62 --> 4664.32]  I really don't
[4664.32 --> 4664.84]  think I do.
[4665.46 --> 4666.40]  So,
[4666.44 --> 4666.62]  if you're
[4666.62 --> 4666.74]  going to
[4666.74 --> 4667.06]  have one
[4667.06 --> 4667.46]  anyway,
[4668.10 --> 4668.38]  then you
[4668.38 --> 4668.74]  should just
[4668.74 --> 4669.32]  get YouTube
[4669.32 --> 4669.64]  Music,
[4669.74 --> 4670.36]  because at
[4670.36 --> 4670.82]  this price
[4670.82 --> 4671.40]  difference of
[4671.40 --> 4672.32]  $6,
[4672.98 --> 4673.76]  it's basically
[4673.76 --> 4674.16]  nothing.
[4674.72 --> 4675.14]  And if you
[4675.14 --> 4675.64]  sign up as
[4675.64 --> 4676.12]  a family
[4676.12 --> 4676.68]  with some
[4676.68 --> 4677.94]  family,
[4678.56 --> 4679.82]  then honestly
[4679.82 --> 4680.44]  the difference
[4680.44 --> 4680.98]  in price is
[4680.98 --> 4681.98]  even smaller
[4681.98 --> 4683.40]  to just get
[4683.40 --> 4683.80]  the full
[4683.80 --> 4684.10]  YouTube
[4684.10 --> 4684.50]  premium.
[4684.50 --> 4691.00]  next up,
[4691.12 --> 4695.10]  correction for
[4695.10 --> 4696.02]  placebos,
[4696.28 --> 4698.76]  correction for
[4698.76 --> 4699.16]  the discussion
[4699.16 --> 4699.88]  about placebos
[4699.88 --> 4700.48]  on February
[4700.48 --> 4701.20]  14th,
[4701.24 --> 4701.80]  WAN show.
[4701.96 --> 4702.08]  Oh,
[4702.14 --> 4702.24]  sure.
[4702.32 --> 4702.58]  This is
[4702.58 --> 4703.14]  pretty short.
[4703.80 --> 4704.28]  The skeptics
[4704.28 --> 4705.06]  guide featuring
[4705.06 --> 4705.62]  Yale associate
[4705.62 --> 4706.62]  professor and
[4706.62 --> 4707.60]  neurology doctor
[4707.60 --> 4708.62]  Stephen Novella
[4708.62 --> 4710.54]  reacted to our
[4710.54 --> 4711.08]  discussion about
[4711.08 --> 4711.48]  the placebo
[4711.48 --> 4711.96]  effect on the
[4711.96 --> 4712.32]  WAN show a
[4712.32 --> 4712.64]  couple weeks
[4712.64 --> 4712.86]  ago.
[4712.86 --> 4713.68]  Dr. Novella
[4713.68 --> 4714.42]  pointed out a
[4714.42 --> 4714.86]  misleading,
[4715.18 --> 4716.18]  where'd it go?
[4717.60 --> 4718.48]  A misleading
[4718.48 --> 4719.98]  sentence we
[4719.98 --> 4720.50]  said about the
[4720.50 --> 4721.20]  placebo effect
[4721.20 --> 4722.02]  and cancer
[4722.02 --> 4722.86]  survival rates,
[4723.06 --> 4724.48]  and we'd like to
[4724.48 --> 4725.52]  issue a corrective
[4725.52 --> 4725.86]  statement.
[4726.28 --> 4726.54]  Believe me,
[4726.54 --> 4726.92]  you'll survive
[4726.92 --> 4727.44]  cancer and
[4727.44 --> 4727.72]  improve your
[4727.72 --> 4728.30]  quality of life,
[4728.38 --> 4728.98]  but it hasn't
[4728.98 --> 4729.64]  been shown to
[4729.64 --> 4730.60]  extend survival
[4730.60 --> 4731.26]  in cancer
[4731.26 --> 4731.70]  patients.
[4732.22 --> 4732.58]  You can find
[4732.58 --> 4733.16]  more information
[4733.16 --> 4734.16]  at links.
[4734.28 --> 4734.60]  Dan,
[4734.68 --> 4735.00]  I'll throw them
[4735.00 --> 4735.34]  in the chat.
[4735.34 --> 4735.52]  Yeah.
[4735.70 --> 4736.14]  Okay.
[4736.74 --> 4737.58]  We unequivocally
[4737.58 --> 4738.46]  do not endorse
[4738.46 --> 4739.10]  companies and
[4739.10 --> 4739.72]  individuals who
[4739.72 --> 4740.20]  use placebo
[4740.20 --> 4740.82]  effect to push
[4740.82 --> 4742.68]  scan products
[4742.68 --> 4743.66]  and earn a
[4743.66 --> 4744.10]  profit from
[4744.10 --> 4744.54]  each other's
[4744.54 --> 4744.98]  unfortunate
[4744.98 --> 4745.68]  situations.
[4746.18 --> 4746.54]  You guys know
[4746.54 --> 4747.16]  we hate scams.
[4747.32 --> 4747.80]  Did people
[4747.80 --> 4748.36]  think we did
[4748.36 --> 4748.56]  that?
[4749.00 --> 4749.28]  I don't know.
[4750.04 --> 4750.38]  Not as
[4750.38 --> 4751.14]  they're acting
[4751.14 --> 4751.64]  in good faith,
[4751.74 --> 4752.04]  but maybe.
[4752.98 --> 4753.26]  Yeah.
[4753.46 --> 4753.90]  We encourage
[4753.90 --> 4754.22]  you to always
[4754.22 --> 4754.70]  contact your
[4754.70 --> 4754.92]  healthcare
[4754.92 --> 4756.48]  professional if
[4756.48 --> 4756.72]  you have a
[4756.72 --> 4757.38]  medical situation.
[4757.78 --> 4758.22]  Also, I'll say
[4758.22 --> 4759.12]  this now, and
[4759.12 --> 4760.10]  I don't know if
[4760.10 --> 4760.76]  we said this
[4760.76 --> 4761.60]  then or not,
[4761.98 --> 4763.20]  we're not a
[4763.20 --> 4763.92]  medical podcast.
[4764.22 --> 4764.80]  We talk for
[4764.80 --> 4765.46]  four and a half
[4765.46 --> 4766.12]  hours sometimes,
[4766.22 --> 4766.80]  so sometimes we're
[4766.80 --> 4767.30]  going to say some
[4767.30 --> 4768.00]  stuff about other
[4768.00 --> 4768.54]  things in our
[4768.54 --> 4769.08]  lives that aren't
[4769.08 --> 4769.34]  tech.
[4769.34 --> 4771.90]  But yeah,
[4771.96 --> 4772.94]  maybe go listen
[4772.94 --> 4774.24]  to the Yale
[4774.24 --> 4775.44]  doctor guy and
[4775.44 --> 4777.16]  not so much us.
[4777.36 --> 4777.96]  And something that
[4777.96 --> 4779.22]  we do know is
[4779.22 --> 4780.94]  that having a
[4780.94 --> 4782.16]  good outlook can
[4782.16 --> 4783.42]  absolutely increase
[4783.42 --> 4784.28]  patient compliance
[4784.28 --> 4786.14]  and better patient
[4786.14 --> 4786.96]  compliance can
[4786.96 --> 4788.14]  absolutely impact
[4788.14 --> 4789.52]  outcomes no matter
[4789.52 --> 4790.18]  what the disease
[4790.18 --> 4790.58]  is.
[4791.32 --> 4792.74]  So yeah, maybe
[4792.74 --> 4793.78]  not directly,
[4794.28 --> 4795.36]  but the main
[4795.36 --> 4795.94]  point of our
[4795.94 --> 4796.86]  conversation was
[4796.86 --> 4797.74]  just that if
[4797.74 --> 4798.62]  people maintain a
[4798.62 --> 4799.24]  positive outlook
[4799.24 --> 4799.68]  and if they
[4799.68 --> 4800.70]  think that
[4800.70 --> 4801.10]  things are
[4801.10 --> 4801.74]  working, it
[4801.74 --> 4802.40]  can have a
[4802.40 --> 4803.14]  positive outcome.
[4804.52 --> 4805.80]  The very, very
[4805.80 --> 4807.38]  specifics, my
[4807.38 --> 4808.42]  apologies if we
[4808.42 --> 4809.32]  were not correct
[4809.32 --> 4810.78]  there, and we
[4810.78 --> 4811.72]  were never,
[4812.38 --> 4814.52]  obviously, never
[4814.52 --> 4816.82]  endorsing people
[4816.82 --> 4818.40]  selling placebos as
[4818.40 --> 4819.52]  real remedies and
[4819.52 --> 4820.24]  saying that, like,
[4820.28 --> 4820.82]  that's okay.
[4821.52 --> 4822.26]  I think our main
[4822.26 --> 4822.94]  point was just
[4822.94 --> 4825.32]  that, like, it's
[4825.32 --> 4826.30]  a thing and that's
[4826.30 --> 4827.06]  why they get away
[4827.06 --> 4828.10]  with it because
[4828.10 --> 4829.08]  they sell you a
[4829.08 --> 4830.42]  placebo and then
[4830.42 --> 4831.50]  it is actually
[4831.50 --> 4832.50]  quite likely,
[4832.72 --> 4833.40]  depending on what
[4833.40 --> 4834.12]  ails you, that you
[4834.12 --> 4835.12]  might feel better.
[4836.62 --> 4837.88]  And that's why
[4837.88 --> 4838.82]  it's so hard to
[4838.82 --> 4839.50]  nail these guys.
[4841.12 --> 4842.54]  Microsoft is
[4842.54 --> 4844.12]  testing free
[4844.12 --> 4845.68]  office desktop
[4845.68 --> 4846.48]  ads.
[4846.82 --> 4847.80]  Sorry, apps.
[4848.76 --> 4849.28]  Wow.
[4849.64 --> 4850.86]  I actually didn't
[4850.86 --> 4851.64]  mean to do that,
[4851.72 --> 4852.74]  but that was one
[4852.74 --> 4853.60]  heck of a Freudian
[4853.60 --> 4853.96]  slip.
[4853.96 --> 4855.74]  Microsoft is
[4855.74 --> 4856.62]  testing a free
[4856.62 --> 4857.54]  desktop version,
[4857.92 --> 4859.38]  Microsoft 365.
[4860.14 --> 4861.02]  When installing
[4861.02 --> 4861.56]  the productivity
[4861.56 --> 4862.28]  suite formerly
[4862.28 --> 4862.64]  known as
[4862.64 --> 4863.74]  Office, users
[4863.74 --> 4864.46]  that opt to
[4864.46 --> 4865.48]  skip signing in
[4865.48 --> 4866.04]  with a Microsoft
[4866.04 --> 4866.82]  account will be
[4866.82 --> 4867.50]  presented with the
[4867.50 --> 4868.60]  option to use
[4868.60 --> 4869.74]  Word, Excel, and
[4869.74 --> 4870.88]  PowerPoint for
[4870.88 --> 4871.34]  free.
[4871.80 --> 4872.76]  Of course, there's
[4872.76 --> 4873.66]  a catch or three.
[4874.18 --> 4875.04]  It is ad
[4875.04 --> 4876.36]  supported with a
[4876.36 --> 4877.64]  persistent ad
[4877.64 --> 4878.42]  banner on the
[4878.42 --> 4879.12]  right side of the
[4879.12 --> 4880.80]  screen and every
[4880.80 --> 4881.64]  few hours.
[4881.64 --> 4883.24]  This is great.
[4883.64 --> 4885.16]  A 15 second video
[4885.16 --> 4886.12]  ad will play,
[4886.64 --> 4887.28]  although at least
[4887.28 --> 4888.00]  it can be muted.
[4888.56 --> 4890.18]  It can only save
[4890.18 --> 4891.60]  to OneDrive and
[4891.60 --> 4892.24]  includes up to
[4892.24 --> 4893.16]  five gigabytes of
[4893.16 --> 4894.26]  storage as part of
[4894.26 --> 4895.42]  the free package.
[4895.98 --> 4897.02]  Many features are
[4897.02 --> 4897.30]  missing.
[4897.46 --> 4898.26]  These are listed on
[4898.26 --> 4900.56]  B-Bomb, but the
[4900.56 --> 4901.84]  basics are there.
[4902.70 --> 4903.76]  I've been warned.
[4903.90 --> 4905.18]  B-Bomb has lots
[4905.18 --> 4905.82]  of ads.
[4906.22 --> 4906.74]  Oh, wow.
[4906.86 --> 4907.64]  Boy, do they ever.
[4907.92 --> 4908.58]  That is a lot of
[4908.58 --> 4908.86]  ads.
[4908.96 --> 4909.50]  My goodness.
[4909.50 --> 4911.66]  What are the
[4911.66 --> 4912.18]  limitations?
[4912.56 --> 4913.90]  What parts of this
[4913.90 --> 4914.66]  are article and
[4914.66 --> 4915.30]  what parts of it
[4915.30 --> 4915.82]  are ads?
[4915.96 --> 4916.48]  Good lord.
[4916.54 --> 4916.96]  I can earn
[4916.96 --> 4918.06]  Roblox gift cards.
[4918.98 --> 4920.12]  How to install
[4920.12 --> 4921.78]  free editing.
[4922.08 --> 4922.84]  Features missing.
[4923.02 --> 4924.02]  Oh, my goodness.
[4924.34 --> 4924.78]  Dictation.
[4925.42 --> 4926.10]  Line spacing.
[4927.22 --> 4927.66]  Okay.
[4928.30 --> 4929.02]  Text box.
[4929.34 --> 4929.62]  Line spacing.
[4930.46 --> 4931.42]  Pivot charts.
[4931.76 --> 4932.20]  Okay.
[4932.28 --> 4932.86]  Pivot table.
[4933.00 --> 4933.50]  Oh, boy.
[4933.58 --> 4933.78]  Okay.
[4933.78 --> 4934.32]  So they're quite
[4934.32 --> 4934.78]  cut down.
[4934.90 --> 4935.08]  Okay.
[4935.08 --> 4936.76]  So basically use
[4936.76 --> 4938.88]  Google's product,
[4939.00 --> 4939.78]  I guess.
[4941.88 --> 4942.32]  Yeah.
[4942.54 --> 4942.86]  Yeah.
[4942.96 --> 4943.84]  Jordan prepared
[4943.84 --> 4944.10]  this.
[4944.22 --> 4944.74]  He goes, is this
[4944.74 --> 4945.32]  going to result in
[4945.32 --> 4946.18]  enough paid subs to
[4946.18 --> 4946.64]  be viable?
[4947.66 --> 4948.96]  And also asks, is
[4948.96 --> 4949.76]  this for the seven
[4949.76 --> 4950.70]  people that are not
[4950.70 --> 4951.38]  aware of Google
[4951.38 --> 4951.82]  Docs?
[4952.44 --> 4955.00]  It is kind of
[4955.00 --> 4955.74]  feeling that way a
[4955.74 --> 4956.12]  little bit.
[4956.32 --> 4957.18]  Kind of feeling that
[4957.18 --> 4957.76]  way a little bit.
[4957.88 --> 4958.12]  Yeah.
[4959.04 --> 4959.48]  And M.
[4959.56 --> 4960.12]  White and float
[4960.12 --> 4960.78]  plane chat says
[4960.78 --> 4961.70]  literally just get
[4961.70 --> 4962.48]  LibreOffice at that
[4962.48 --> 4962.68]  point.
[4962.74 --> 4963.16]  Like, what are we
[4963.16 --> 4964.64]  even talking about
[4964.64 --> 4964.88]  here?
[4966.06 --> 4966.86]  This is a fun
[4966.86 --> 4967.20]  one.
[4968.96 --> 4969.40]  Wacky
[4969.40 --> 4970.62]  foldables and
[4970.62 --> 4971.60]  other stuff at
[4971.60 --> 4972.34]  Mobile World
[4972.34 --> 4973.14]  Congress.
[4974.62 --> 4975.60]  MWC ran this
[4975.60 --> 4976.24]  week from March
[4976.24 --> 4976.92]  3rd to March
[4976.92 --> 4978.70]  6th in, I'm
[4978.70 --> 4978.96]  going to say
[4978.96 --> 4979.36]  this wrong,
[4979.82 --> 4980.56]  Barthelona.
[4980.72 --> 4981.28]  I think you're
[4981.28 --> 4981.76]  supposed to do
[4981.76 --> 4982.38]  it with a TH
[4982.38 --> 4983.06]  sound, right?
[4983.70 --> 4984.42]  Oh, really?
[4984.58 --> 4985.02]  I wish they
[4985.02 --> 4985.52]  would just spell
[4985.52 --> 4986.16]  things the way
[4986.16 --> 4986.84]  that they're
[4986.84 --> 4987.40]  supposed to be
[4987.40 --> 4988.82]  said because if
[4988.82 --> 4989.04]  you're going to
[4989.04 --> 4989.32]  have an
[4989.32 --> 4990.28]  anglicized spelling
[4990.28 --> 4993.40]  anyway, why not
[4993.40 --> 4994.26]  in good faith?
[4994.26 --> 4995.14]  try to spell
[4995.14 --> 4995.80]  it in a way
[4995.80 --> 4997.48]  that makes it
[4997.48 --> 4998.82]  spelled like it
[4998.82 --> 5000.76]  sounds Barthelona?
[5001.02 --> 5001.68]  I don't know.
[5001.90 --> 5002.38]  I don't think
[5002.38 --> 5002.86]  that is.
[5003.50 --> 5003.74]  Dude.
[5003.82 --> 5004.32]  I think it's just
[5004.32 --> 5004.90]  spelled the same
[5004.90 --> 5005.60]  way in Spanish,
[5005.74 --> 5007.16]  which is probably
[5007.16 --> 5007.72]  why it sounds
[5007.72 --> 5008.28]  different than it's
[5008.28 --> 5008.46]  spelled.
[5008.60 --> 5009.24]  Well, then give me
[5009.24 --> 5010.38]  an anglicized spelling
[5010.38 --> 5011.36]  like everything else.
[5012.84 --> 5014.28]  Anyway, we're
[5014.28 --> 5015.10]  supposed to rapid
[5015.10 --> 5016.64]  fire react to
[5016.64 --> 5019.30]  each device and
[5019.30 --> 5020.16]  give it a 1 to
[5020.16 --> 5020.96]  10 score.
[5020.96 --> 5021.84]  All right.
[5022.06 --> 5023.96]  So first up is
[5023.96 --> 5025.02]  the Lenovo
[5025.02 --> 5026.42]  Thinkbook Flip
[5026.42 --> 5028.42]  AI prototype.
[5029.72 --> 5030.78]  A mega two in
[5030.78 --> 5031.08]  one.
[5032.18 --> 5034.84]  Oh my gosh.
[5035.70 --> 5036.58]  This is from
[5036.58 --> 5037.90]  PCMag.com.
[5039.90 --> 5040.42]  Whoa.
[5042.28 --> 5042.58]  Okay.
[5042.62 --> 5043.48]  We should decide
[5043.48 --> 5045.38]  what our scale
[5045.38 --> 5045.92]  means.
[5045.92 --> 5048.72]  So is this out
[5048.72 --> 5049.56]  of 10 in terms
[5049.56 --> 5050.92]  of like, would
[5050.92 --> 5052.30]  I buy it or
[5052.30 --> 5053.60]  would I use it?
[5053.66 --> 5054.56]  Because those
[5054.56 --> 5056.02]  definitely are not
[5056.02 --> 5056.80]  the same thing in
[5056.80 --> 5057.34]  this case.
[5057.34 --> 5058.26]  Like if somebody
[5058.26 --> 5059.26]  gave this to me
[5059.26 --> 5061.02]  for free, I feel
[5061.02 --> 5061.84]  like I might
[5061.84 --> 5062.94]  consider using it.
[5063.56 --> 5064.58]  It looks like a
[5064.58 --> 5064.88]  joke.
[5065.72 --> 5066.88]  It looks like a
[5066.88 --> 5067.84]  it looks like it's
[5067.84 --> 5068.50]  photoshopped.
[5068.50 --> 5069.40]  It looks it looks
[5069.40 --> 5070.02]  like a meme.
[5072.02 --> 5072.54]  Okay.
[5072.54 --> 5074.94]  The outer display
[5074.94 --> 5076.60]  can flip up to
[5076.60 --> 5078.02]  become a large
[5078.02 --> 5079.26]  vertical display.
[5079.46 --> 5080.50]  So it kind of
[5080.50 --> 5080.98]  goes in.
[5081.12 --> 5081.34]  It looks.
[5081.46 --> 5081.98]  Yeah, there you
[5081.98 --> 5082.20]  go.
[5082.42 --> 5083.30]  There's a there's a
[5083.30 --> 5084.22]  better shot of it.
[5085.40 --> 5085.92]  Wow.
[5086.36 --> 5088.00]  Also, this is like
[5088.00 --> 5089.44]  the ugliest hotel
[5089.44 --> 5089.82]  room.
[5091.18 --> 5093.38]  But great job PC
[5093.38 --> 5094.32]  Mag for making it
[5094.32 --> 5094.56]  work.
[5094.62 --> 5095.24]  It kind of works.
[5095.86 --> 5097.04]  Luke, what's your
[5097.04 --> 5097.32]  rating?
[5099.38 --> 5100.74]  So again, sorry,
[5100.92 --> 5101.76]  what are we doing
[5101.76 --> 5102.54]  it based on if we
[5102.54 --> 5103.24]  would use it or if
[5103.24 --> 5103.80]  we would buy it?
[5105.30 --> 5106.04]  You wouldn't buy
[5106.04 --> 5106.48]  anything.
[5106.68 --> 5107.26]  So let's go with
[5107.26 --> 5107.96]  if we use it.
[5108.40 --> 5109.26]  I might buy
[5109.26 --> 5109.72]  something.
[5109.86 --> 5110.22]  We'll see.
[5110.66 --> 5111.44]  How about if you
[5111.44 --> 5112.08]  would use it for
[5112.08 --> 5112.38]  work?
[5114.16 --> 5115.10]  If this was our
[5115.10 --> 5116.28]  standardized laptop.
[5116.42 --> 5116.66]  I would.
[5117.38 --> 5118.20]  I would use this
[5118.20 --> 5118.66]  out of 10.
[5118.82 --> 5119.32]  Out of 10.
[5119.46 --> 5120.40]  I would unfold it.
[5121.80 --> 5122.84]  Would I use it
[5122.84 --> 5123.36]  out of 10?
[5123.40 --> 5124.06]  I would definitely
[5124.06 --> 5124.56]  use it.
[5124.60 --> 5125.06]  Like you wouldn't
[5125.06 --> 5125.64]  ask for something
[5125.64 --> 5126.42]  else because we
[5126.42 --> 5126.78]  could give you
[5126.78 --> 5127.30]  something else.
[5127.70 --> 5128.60]  Would you prefer
[5128.60 --> 5128.90]  it?
[5129.98 --> 5130.82]  I wouldn't.
[5131.76 --> 5132.70]  This is sounding
[5132.70 --> 5133.32]  like a six.
[5134.42 --> 5134.78]  Yeah.
[5134.88 --> 5135.24]  I think it might
[5135.24 --> 5136.00]  be a six or a
[5136.00 --> 5136.62]  seven because I
[5136.62 --> 5137.24]  travel with an
[5137.24 --> 5137.80]  extra screen.
[5139.06 --> 5139.40]  Okay.
[5139.88 --> 5140.66]  And this is just
[5140.66 --> 5141.28]  an extra screen
[5141.28 --> 5143.22]  but slightly less
[5143.22 --> 5144.62]  cool because it's
[5144.62 --> 5145.76]  up instead of to
[5145.76 --> 5145.84]  the side.
[5145.84 --> 5146.32]  How are you going
[5146.32 --> 5147.12]  to use this on a
[5147.12 --> 5147.48]  plane?
[5148.66 --> 5149.86]  I just don't think
[5149.86 --> 5150.26]  you would.
[5150.36 --> 5151.14]  Dude, buddy behind
[5151.14 --> 5151.62]  you is going to
[5151.62 --> 5152.60]  lean their seat back.
[5153.80 --> 5154.66]  I mean, I guess it
[5154.66 --> 5155.32]  wouldn't break it
[5155.32 --> 5155.98]  though because it's
[5155.98 --> 5156.44]  bendable.
[5156.82 --> 5157.34]  I think it bends
[5157.34 --> 5158.16]  the other way so
[5158.16 --> 5158.80]  it absolutely.
[5159.44 --> 5160.22]  Oh yeah, right.
[5160.22 --> 5162.38]  Well, to be fair
[5162.38 --> 5163.08]  though, it wouldn't
[5163.08 --> 5164.04]  crunch under because
[5164.04 --> 5164.76]  it would go all the
[5164.76 --> 5165.40]  way to the top of
[5165.40 --> 5165.76]  the seat.
[5166.18 --> 5166.82]  You'd have to like
[5166.82 --> 5168.16]  pull their hair off
[5168.16 --> 5168.54]  of it.
[5169.70 --> 5170.02]  Yeah.
[5171.06 --> 5171.42]  Yeah.
[5171.46 --> 5172.36]  I'd give it a six.
[5172.50 --> 5172.72]  I think.
[5174.42 --> 5175.26]  I don't think I can
[5175.26 --> 5176.08]  go higher than a four.
[5177.56 --> 5178.42]  I would definitely
[5178.42 --> 5179.50]  use it in like hotel
[5179.50 --> 5180.06]  rooms and stuff.
[5180.16 --> 5180.60]  I would use it.
[5183.72 --> 5184.26]  All right.
[5184.58 --> 5185.18]  Let's go.
[5185.34 --> 5186.00]  Let's move on to
[5186.00 --> 5186.44]  our next one.
[5186.68 --> 5186.78]  It looks like you get
[5186.78 --> 5187.20]  two 16 by nine
[5187.20 --> 5188.14]  windows on it
[5188.14 --> 5188.50]  basically.
[5188.50 --> 5191.66]  Next up is the
[5191.66 --> 5193.12]  Lenovo Magic Bay
[5193.12 --> 5195.28]  dual display concept.
[5196.54 --> 5197.22]  Here we go.
[5197.28 --> 5197.74]  This is from
[5197.74 --> 5198.68]  Digital Trends.
[5199.56 --> 5200.40]  Oh, this looks
[5200.40 --> 5201.10]  more like your
[5201.10 --> 5201.84]  style, Luke.
[5202.48 --> 5203.34]  It sure does.
[5205.28 --> 5206.54]  Two screens or
[5206.54 --> 5207.02]  one.
[5207.36 --> 5208.92]  It's up to you.
[5210.02 --> 5210.88]  The thing that
[5210.88 --> 5211.62]  gets me with this
[5211.62 --> 5212.40]  stuff is it's
[5212.40 --> 5213.26]  really not much
[5213.26 --> 5214.42]  harder to just
[5214.42 --> 5215.32]  have an external
[5215.32 --> 5216.26]  display and a
[5216.26 --> 5216.98]  normal laptop.
[5216.98 --> 5218.72]  external.
[5219.04 --> 5219.76]  So this uses
[5219.76 --> 5220.90]  special external
[5220.90 --> 5222.40]  displays that use
[5222.40 --> 5224.06]  Lenovo's Magic Bay
[5224.06 --> 5225.70]  connection to add
[5225.70 --> 5227.24]  either two 13 inch
[5227.24 --> 5228.92]  screens or a single
[5228.92 --> 5230.54]  vertical eight inch
[5230.54 --> 5231.02]  screen.
[5231.60 --> 5233.00]  It uses pogo pins
[5233.00 --> 5233.52]  and magnets.
[5233.76 --> 5234.28]  It's a proprietary
[5234.28 --> 5235.02]  connector.
[5235.60 --> 5237.56]  So you can't just
[5237.56 --> 5238.08]  carry it to the next
[5238.08 --> 5238.24]  one.
[5238.46 --> 5239.16]  And I've been using
[5239.16 --> 5239.88]  the same.
[5240.82 --> 5241.80]  I've been using the
[5241.80 --> 5242.60]  same external screen
[5242.60 --> 5243.64]  for two different
[5243.64 --> 5244.68]  laptops so far.
[5244.68 --> 5246.18]  You won't be doing
[5246.18 --> 5246.52]  that here.
[5247.24 --> 5247.58]  Exactly.
[5247.98 --> 5249.20]  So like the buying
[5249.20 --> 5250.52]  of this very low.
[5251.32 --> 5252.76]  The using of this
[5252.76 --> 5254.24]  at least one of the
[5254.24 --> 5255.04]  external displays
[5255.04 --> 5256.52]  probably like a seven.
[5256.92 --> 5257.50]  How much do you
[5257.50 --> 5258.54]  think that drives the
[5258.54 --> 5259.18]  design of these
[5259.18 --> 5259.56]  products?
[5259.56 --> 5260.56]  Because if I'm a
[5260.56 --> 5261.50]  Lenovo and I'm
[5261.50 --> 5262.34]  targeting businesses,
[5262.34 --> 5264.96]  do I care at all if
[5264.96 --> 5265.88]  Luke the individual
[5265.88 --> 5266.92]  would buy this?
[5267.32 --> 5268.56]  Maybe not because I
[5268.56 --> 5269.08]  don't need you.
[5269.14 --> 5270.36]  You care a lot that
[5270.36 --> 5271.88]  you might get lock in
[5271.88 --> 5272.90]  to the IT team.
[5273.30 --> 5273.56]  Yeah.
[5273.62 --> 5275.04]  Because of this.
[5275.36 --> 5275.92]  Because Luke's
[5275.92 --> 5276.78]  company bought it for
[5276.78 --> 5276.98]  him.
[5276.98 --> 5277.54]  That you have.
[5277.64 --> 5278.52]  And Luke likes it
[5278.52 --> 5280.26]  and will complain to
[5280.26 --> 5281.14]  IT if he doesn't get
[5281.14 --> 5282.60]  one again or whatever.
[5282.74 --> 5282.92]  Right.
[5283.42 --> 5284.54]  Or if the new laptop
[5284.54 --> 5285.20]  doesn't have those
[5285.20 --> 5285.64]  screens.
[5286.48 --> 5286.94]  Oh boy.
[5287.82 --> 5289.62]  Lenovo Yoga Solar
[5289.62 --> 5290.92]  PC Concept.
[5292.34 --> 5292.86]  Solar.
[5293.86 --> 5295.08]  It's a solar PC
[5295.08 --> 5295.32]  car.
[5295.80 --> 5298.26]  Solar panels on the
[5298.26 --> 5298.60]  lid.
[5298.60 --> 5300.52]  Um.
[5302.56 --> 5303.08]  Oh.
[5303.48 --> 5303.96]  Okay.
[5303.98 --> 5304.58]  How well do they
[5304.58 --> 5305.38]  work when they have
[5305.38 --> 5308.50]  horrible line of
[5308.50 --> 5309.16]  sight to the sun?
[5309.16 --> 5309.60]  They claim.
[5309.86 --> 5310.48]  Or it's covered in
[5310.48 --> 5310.86]  stickers.
[5310.98 --> 5312.56]  They claim that even
[5312.56 --> 5313.78]  in low light
[5313.78 --> 5316.04]  conditions, the panel
[5316.04 --> 5316.78]  can generate enough
[5316.78 --> 5317.86]  power to sustain the
[5317.86 --> 5319.00]  battery charge when the
[5319.00 --> 5320.12]  PC is idle.
[5320.56 --> 5322.10]  They also claim that
[5322.10 --> 5323.18]  with enough direct
[5323.18 --> 5324.78]  sunlight, 20 minutes
[5324.78 --> 5326.00]  of exposure can power
[5326.00 --> 5327.58]  up to one hour of
[5327.58 --> 5328.38]  video playback.
[5328.60 --> 5330.20]  with a long
[5330.20 --> 5331.82]  disclaimer on this
[5331.82 --> 5332.10]  claim.
[5336.32 --> 5337.24]  What do you think?
[5338.30 --> 5339.86]  This feels like a
[5339.86 --> 5340.62]  this feels like a
[5340.62 --> 5341.62]  three to me.
[5341.86 --> 5342.78]  A two?
[5343.08 --> 5343.44]  Like.
[5344.76 --> 5345.84]  They know battery
[5345.84 --> 5346.82]  banks exist, right?
[5347.58 --> 5349.46]  Like if I wanted to
[5349.46 --> 5350.62]  carry like solar panels
[5350.62 --> 5350.82]  are good.
[5350.86 --> 5351.28]  They're going to add
[5351.28 --> 5353.06]  weight to this thing.
[5353.14 --> 5353.80]  I have to carry them
[5353.80 --> 5354.94]  around all the time
[5354.94 --> 5355.84]  and I'm going to use
[5355.84 --> 5357.38]  them sometimes.
[5357.38 --> 5358.54]  How often do you
[5358.54 --> 5359.54]  use it outside?
[5359.54 --> 5360.28]  The TV involved with
[5360.28 --> 5361.20]  it also adds more
[5361.20 --> 5361.54]  weight.
[5362.34 --> 5362.88]  How often do you use
[5362.88 --> 5364.44]  it outside is a big
[5364.44 --> 5364.74]  question.
[5364.80 --> 5365.28]  How often do you use
[5365.28 --> 5366.74]  it outside, indirect
[5366.74 --> 5367.58]  line of sight of the
[5367.58 --> 5369.10]  sun when you're not
[5369.10 --> 5370.86]  like putting it so far
[5370.86 --> 5371.76]  folded back that it's
[5371.76 --> 5372.36]  not going to see the
[5372.36 --> 5373.26]  sun at all anyways?
[5373.92 --> 5374.50]  Yeah, exactly.
[5377.90 --> 5378.94]  And then you can't put
[5378.94 --> 5379.70]  stickers on the back
[5379.70 --> 5380.36]  like Dan said.
[5380.90 --> 5381.26]  Okay.
[5381.32 --> 5382.22]  I don't know if that's a
[5382.22 --> 5383.46]  major consideration, but
[5383.46 --> 5383.72]  sure.
[5383.82 --> 5384.50]  That matters a lot in my
[5384.50 --> 5385.26]  field Linus.
[5385.46 --> 5385.66]  Okay.
[5386.46 --> 5387.12]  How will they know I
[5387.12 --> 5387.48]  use arch?
[5387.68 --> 5388.64]  This needs to be taken
[5388.64 --> 5388.92]  seriously.
[5388.92 --> 5389.22]  Okay.
[5389.28 --> 5389.84]  I'm sorry.
[5390.02 --> 5390.76]  I'm sorry.
[5391.54 --> 5392.38]  Have you ever been?
[5392.52 --> 5393.08]  Have you ever been to
[5393.08 --> 5393.92]  an IT conference?
[5395.24 --> 5396.24]  Everyone's the back of
[5396.24 --> 5396.80]  their laptops are
[5396.80 --> 5397.48]  covered in stickers.
[5398.76 --> 5399.32]  I'm sorry.
[5399.36 --> 5399.90]  I brought it up.
[5400.16 --> 5401.28]  See the chat.
[5402.56 --> 5403.92]  You also sell stickers.
[5403.92 --> 5406.00]  Oh goodness.
[5406.54 --> 5407.78]  More from Lenovo.
[5407.78 --> 5409.24]  This time from Tom's
[5409.24 --> 5409.66]  Hardware.
[5411.96 --> 5414.54]  A USB-C connected 32
[5414.54 --> 5415.66]  tops NPU.
[5416.44 --> 5417.50]  That's right my friends.
[5418.08 --> 5419.16]  Instead of purchasing
[5419.16 --> 5421.56]  an AI laptop, you could
[5421.56 --> 5424.64]  get a regular laptop and
[5424.64 --> 5425.66]  add AI.
[5427.78 --> 5429.24]  By USB-C.
[5431.88 --> 5433.38]  I think this is a zero
[5433.38 --> 5433.84]  for me.
[5433.84 --> 5434.68]  Okay.
[5437.78 --> 5441.70]  Wow.
[5442.10 --> 5443.36]  At least for my laptop.
[5443.86 --> 5444.68]  Like if I had like,
[5445.02 --> 5445.96]  like I think I actually
[5445.96 --> 5447.44]  have a similar little USB
[5447.44 --> 5449.20]  AI dongle in my server
[5449.20 --> 5450.06]  right now because we're
[5450.06 --> 5452.92]  using it for training for
[5452.92 --> 5455.68]  a, like a machine vision
[5455.68 --> 5456.76]  project or something like
[5456.76 --> 5457.04]  that.
[5457.12 --> 5458.14]  But in terms of the
[5458.14 --> 5459.08]  pitch of this, it's
[5459.08 --> 5459.62]  Thunderbolt.
[5459.74 --> 5460.38]  Oh my God.
[5460.90 --> 5461.12]  Okay.
[5461.14 --> 5462.06]  So you're not plugging it
[5462.06 --> 5463.08]  into anything that matters.
[5463.24 --> 5463.92]  What's going to have
[5463.92 --> 5464.40]  Thunderbolt?
[5464.46 --> 5464.98]  Okay.
[5464.98 --> 5466.20]  It's too anemic.
[5467.34 --> 5468.20]  32 tops.
[5468.30 --> 5468.86]  Not enough for you,
[5468.90 --> 5468.98]  huh?
[5469.06 --> 5469.32]  Yeah.
[5469.72 --> 5470.00]  Yeah.
[5470.78 --> 5471.22]  All right.
[5471.72 --> 5472.22]  Okay.
[5472.48 --> 5473.30]  Here we go.
[5474.02 --> 5476.60]  Infinix Zero Series Mini
[5476.60 --> 5478.38]  Tri-Fold Concept.
[5479.38 --> 5480.94]  This is on tech radar.
[5482.20 --> 5482.36]  No.
[5486.36 --> 5486.52]  Really?
[5486.70 --> 5487.00]  Zero.
[5487.08 --> 5487.98]  Just straight up no?
[5488.94 --> 5489.30]  No.
[5490.26 --> 5490.94]  You're not even going to
[5490.94 --> 5491.54]  give me a number?
[5492.76 --> 5493.16]  Zero.
[5493.16 --> 5493.24]  Zero.
[5494.82 --> 5495.18]  Zero.
[5495.42 --> 5496.34]  Oh man, this is like a
[5496.34 --> 5496.54]  four.
[5496.66 --> 5497.90]  Maybe a one.
[5498.06 --> 5498.30]  Really?
[5498.30 --> 5498.72]  I could see this being
[5498.72 --> 5498.74]  like a four.
[5498.74 --> 5499.60]  You're going to deal with
[5499.60 --> 5500.68]  the giggly bitty of
[5500.68 --> 5501.82]  unfolding this the whole
[5501.82 --> 5502.02]  way?
[5502.20 --> 5503.14]  Because it's not just a
[5503.14 --> 5503.36]  flip.
[5503.52 --> 5504.52]  It's not one movement.
[5504.66 --> 5505.86]  You have to, I think you
[5505.86 --> 5506.66]  have to like pull the
[5506.66 --> 5507.12]  thing apart.
[5507.22 --> 5508.22]  It looks super annoying.
[5508.82 --> 5510.12]  But look, I could clip it
[5510.12 --> 5511.82]  to my backpack.
[5513.42 --> 5515.20]  That's from LTTStore.com.
[5515.46 --> 5516.84]  That's, no.
[5516.84 --> 5517.50]  Yeah, no.
[5517.50 --> 5517.68]  Right.
[5517.68 --> 5518.92]  Yeah.
[5519.66 --> 5521.18]  Look, I'm just saying I
[5521.18 --> 5523.36]  could, I'm treating a five
[5523.36 --> 5524.04]  like a neutral.
[5524.28 --> 5524.64]  Okay.
[5525.14 --> 5526.98]  So I, I'm like below
[5526.98 --> 5527.40]  neutral.
[5527.40 --> 5528.48]  Like I don't want it.
[5528.52 --> 5529.16]  I don't want it.
[5530.50 --> 5532.18]  I would actively dislike
[5532.18 --> 5532.54]  this.
[5533.82 --> 5535.24]  If I was given a new one
[5535.24 --> 5536.78]  of these, I would use my,
[5536.88 --> 5538.62]  my old pixel that I don't
[5538.62 --> 5539.78]  like over it.
[5540.24 --> 5540.84]  All right.
[5541.00 --> 5541.46]  Next up.
[5541.46 --> 5542.46]  It just looks very
[5542.46 --> 5543.34]  annoying to use.
[5543.42 --> 5544.08]  Most of the time when I'm
[5544.08 --> 5544.76]  looking at something on my
[5544.76 --> 5546.44]  phone, I want it fast and
[5546.44 --> 5547.02]  then I want to put the
[5547.02 --> 5547.48]  phone away.
[5547.86 --> 5549.00]  I don't want to just like,
[5549.70 --> 5551.36]  Oh, let me, let me unfold
[5551.36 --> 5552.84]  this twice so I can get a
[5552.84 --> 5554.08]  full actual phone and then
[5554.08 --> 5554.98]  go through and check things
[5554.98 --> 5556.00]  and then fold it two more
[5556.00 --> 5556.94]  times to put it back down.
[5556.96 --> 5557.92]  And then it's a massive
[5557.92 --> 5559.20]  brick in my pocket and I
[5559.20 --> 5559.76]  can put it away.
[5560.02 --> 5560.94]  That's so annoying.
[5561.30 --> 5561.62]  I don't want to.
[5561.62 --> 5561.76]  Okay.
[5561.84 --> 5563.06]  This time from the verge
[5563.06 --> 5566.80]  Infinix zero series.
[5566.92 --> 5567.38]  Oh, wait, shoot.
[5567.52 --> 5569.46]  So no Infinix solar energy
[5569.46 --> 5571.76]  reserving technology uses
[5571.76 --> 5575.04]  perovskite solar cells, which
[5575.04 --> 5576.16]  are thinner and cheaper
[5576.16 --> 5577.26]  than traditional silicon
[5577.26 --> 5578.14]  solar cells.
[5580.06 --> 5581.26]  Its current iteration was
[5581.26 --> 5582.70]  able to deliver two watts of
[5582.70 --> 5583.14]  charging.
[5584.14 --> 5585.78]  Being able to just like huck
[5585.78 --> 5588.60]  your phone onto like a, like
[5588.60 --> 5590.88]  a car mount or something and
[5590.88 --> 5592.32]  get charged with the sun coming
[5592.32 --> 5592.82]  through the dash.
[5592.90 --> 5593.72]  I mean, I, yeah, I can see
[5593.72 --> 5594.76]  that becoming kind of useful
[5594.76 --> 5596.04]  why you don't use Megsafe and
[5596.04 --> 5596.80]  just plug in a cable.
[5596.90 --> 5599.24]  I don't know, but that's
[5599.24 --> 5599.98]  something.
[5599.98 --> 5601.78]  I think it's cool if you're
[5601.78 --> 5604.76]  outside somewhere and you put
[5604.76 --> 5606.52]  your phone face down on a
[5606.52 --> 5607.72]  table and it charges it.
[5608.04 --> 5609.76]  I think it's pretty sweet.
[5610.26 --> 5610.70]  Yeah.
[5611.30 --> 5612.02]  I'd be into this.
[5612.12 --> 5612.70]  So I mentioned overheating
[5612.70 --> 5613.16]  problems.
[5613.26 --> 5614.46]  I would be interested to see.
[5614.66 --> 5615.06]  Oh, yeah.
[5615.56 --> 5616.50]  How that goes.
[5616.96 --> 5617.42]  All right.
[5617.88 --> 5618.58]  Next up.
[5618.62 --> 5619.16]  I like it though.
[5619.40 --> 5619.80]  Whoa.
[5619.92 --> 5621.64]  Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro.
[5621.64 --> 5625.26]  Now they might look like just
[5625.26 --> 5628.36]  regular, you know, AirPods
[5628.36 --> 5631.18]  clones, but they can stream
[5631.18 --> 5632.86]  music over Wi-Fi.
[5633.92 --> 5636.20]  They utilize Qualcomm's expanded
[5636.20 --> 5637.90]  personal area network to provide
[5637.90 --> 5640.08]  audio at up to 96 kilohertz, 24
[5640.08 --> 5643.56]  bit up to 4.2 megabit per second,
[5643.76 --> 5645.42]  exceeding Bluetooth bandwidth.
[5645.66 --> 5646.70]  And if Wi-Fi is not available,
[5646.78 --> 5647.80]  they switch back to Bluetooth
[5647.80 --> 5648.18]  mode.
[5648.88 --> 5649.74]  That's pretty cool.
[5649.80 --> 5650.54]  They look bulky though.
[5651.64 --> 5656.54]  I don't care.
[5657.28 --> 5657.64]  Okay.
[5657.90 --> 5659.72]  As a dub said on Flowplane, no
[5659.72 --> 5660.96]  solar panels on them, two out of
[5660.96 --> 5661.16]  10.
[5664.22 --> 5664.62]  Okay.
[5666.26 --> 5668.00]  I just like, I don't know.
[5670.00 --> 5671.96]  If I'm at home, it's not like I
[5671.96 --> 5672.98]  don't have my phone on me.
[5673.34 --> 5674.80]  If I'm not at home, I'm pretty
[5674.80 --> 5675.88]  much not using Wi-Fi.
[5678.28 --> 5678.88]  I don't know.
[5678.90 --> 5680.22]  Do they use Wi-Fi direct though?
[5680.22 --> 5681.80]  Because if they could do that,
[5681.86 --> 5682.44]  then that's cool.
[5682.76 --> 5684.26]  I think it means that they're
[5684.26 --> 5685.90]  using Wi-Fi to the phone.
[5686.80 --> 5687.92]  Yeah, I think so.
[5688.30 --> 5689.38]  I think that's what it means.
[5689.54 --> 5691.32]  Not all devices handle Wi-Fi to
[5691.32 --> 5694.04]  multiple points very well, though.
[5694.58 --> 5697.42]  Like I realized using the Mac as my
[5697.42 --> 5699.44]  daily driver that you can't internet
[5699.44 --> 5701.14]  connection share your Wi-Fi
[5701.14 --> 5701.98]  connection on this.
[5701.98 --> 5704.12]  So I use that feature on Windows for
[5704.12 --> 5704.54]  flights.
[5704.82 --> 5707.04]  I'll buy one in-flight pass and then
[5707.04 --> 5708.30]  I'll share it with everyone that I'm
[5708.30 --> 5710.30]  with or with my phone, like with my
[5710.30 --> 5711.00]  multiple devices.
[5711.42 --> 5714.16]  And I can't do that on the Mac, which
[5714.16 --> 5714.76]  kind of blows.
[5715.14 --> 5716.36]  Like it can share, it can internet
[5716.36 --> 5718.02]  connection share if you plug in a
[5718.02 --> 5719.32]  wired connection and then you share
[5719.32 --> 5719.90]  over Wi-Fi.
[5719.98 --> 5720.60]  It can do that.
[5720.60 --> 5723.34]  But it can't Wi-Fi share its Wi-Fi
[5723.34 --> 5725.24]  connection, as far as I can tell.
[5726.28 --> 5727.36]  Here's another one.
[5728.78 --> 5731.52]  This is, wait, where is it?
[5731.62 --> 5732.30]  Ah, here we go.
[5732.46 --> 5732.82]  Yes.
[5733.40 --> 5736.76]  The Samsung Flex Gaming Concept.
[5738.76 --> 5740.28]  Hold on, someone says, hold on.
[5740.32 --> 5742.12]  Someone says, yes, you can over
[5742.12 --> 5742.66]  Bluetooth.
[5744.06 --> 5746.90]  Well, what am I connecting to it via
[5746.90 --> 5747.36]  Bluetooth?
[5747.36 --> 5747.60]  Bluetooth.
[5749.68 --> 5751.72]  Might be able to with a USB Wi-Fi.
[5751.84 --> 5752.78]  Yeah, I'm not doing that.
[5755.86 --> 5757.76]  Bluetooth Wi-Fi sharing.
[5759.06 --> 5761.70]  Man, I swear I Googled this and I did
[5761.70 --> 5762.66]  not find it.
[5762.84 --> 5764.72]  And I went into, I had to like go deep
[5764.72 --> 5767.36]  into the settings and enable internet
[5767.96 --> 5770.58]  connection sharing in some submenu
[5770.58 --> 5770.96]  somewhere.
[5771.42 --> 5772.92]  And then it just didn't offer me the
[5772.92 --> 5773.20]  option.
[5773.32 --> 5775.24]  Well, what I will say then, at the very
[5775.24 --> 5777.32]  least, is it's much easier in Windows.
[5777.80 --> 5780.42]  You just click a button just like you
[5780.42 --> 5782.00]  would on your phone or whatever.
[5783.32 --> 5783.62]  Okay.
[5783.64 --> 5785.60]  So looking at this next device, have you
[5785.60 --> 5786.54]  brought it up yet?
[5786.68 --> 5787.10]  There you go.
[5787.78 --> 5789.24]  Looking at this next device, it looks
[5789.24 --> 5791.00]  like the thumbsticks have to go into
[5791.00 --> 5793.10]  the holes on the other side.
[5793.34 --> 5796.78]  And the ABXY and left, right up, down
[5796.78 --> 5800.90]  are like the slanted sides of the
[5800.90 --> 5802.90]  holes, which is horrible.
[5803.06 --> 5803.26]  Yeah.
[5803.36 --> 5804.40]  This is just a concept.
[5804.40 --> 5804.48]  Yep.
[5804.48 --> 5805.46]  This is not a real product.
[5805.96 --> 5807.18]  It's a cool idea.
[5807.38 --> 5808.48]  It's a cool concept.
[5810.08 --> 5812.64]  I don't want to use the arrow keys or
[5812.64 --> 5816.40]  ABXY at all ever, but it's a cool
[5816.40 --> 5817.00]  concept.
[5820.58 --> 5821.96]  So you have to thumb the holes.
[5822.08 --> 5822.18]  Yeah.
[5822.18 --> 5824.12]  I think you like put your thumb in the
[5824.12 --> 5826.62]  hole and then have to like hit the side
[5826.62 --> 5827.42]  of the button.
[5827.84 --> 5828.04]  Yeah.
[5828.20 --> 5829.30]  I'm not into that at all.
[5829.30 --> 5830.50]  It might end up...
[5830.50 --> 5831.70]  I don't think so.
[5831.78 --> 5831.98]  Yeah.
[5832.06 --> 5834.32]  It might end up being okay, but I don't
[5834.32 --> 5835.22]  think I would like it.
[5835.68 --> 5835.92]  Yeah.
[5835.98 --> 5838.38]  I think I would dislike it so much that I
[5838.38 --> 5839.78]  would not use it.
[5839.86 --> 5840.64]  I wouldn't buy it.
[5841.00 --> 5843.34]  However, if you could give me something
[5843.34 --> 5845.50]  where like the thumbsticks are like a
[5845.50 --> 5847.12]  poppet or something and I can like push
[5847.12 --> 5848.74]  them in and I can just fold it flat and
[5848.74 --> 5850.50]  have decent buttons or something, I could
[5850.50 --> 5851.66]  maybe get into that.
[5852.12 --> 5854.14]  I would like to be able to fold my
[5854.14 --> 5856.94]  handheld gaming device because I do get
[5856.94 --> 5858.46]  sketched out about them when traveling.
[5859.00 --> 5860.58]  And if I could avoid having like a big
[5860.58 --> 5865.02]  carrying case for it and could just fold
[5865.02 --> 5867.02]  it and then like if I had a nice case on
[5867.02 --> 5868.94]  the back of it, that'd be pretty sick.
[5869.08 --> 5871.20]  80 Dublin float plane chat says, now I can
[5871.20 --> 5872.86]  rage quit like I'm hanging up on my boss.
[5874.02 --> 5874.46]  Yeah.
[5874.74 --> 5875.08]  Sweet.
[5875.46 --> 5876.08]  I love it.
[5876.72 --> 5877.16]  Okay.
[5877.16 --> 5880.04]  Our last one is the Samsung tri-fold
[5880.04 --> 5883.60]  smartphone concept called the asymmetric
[5883.60 --> 5885.12]  flip for now.
[5885.24 --> 5888.62]  Similar to the Galaxy Z flip, but with
[5888.62 --> 5889.94]  two fold points.
[5891.86 --> 5894.46]  Like why?
[5894.68 --> 5895.96]  Oh God.
[5896.54 --> 5897.14]  Why?
[5897.66 --> 5897.94]  Hmm.
[5899.02 --> 5899.74]  Okay.
[5901.92 --> 5902.56]  Why?
[5903.06 --> 5903.46]  Yeah.
[5903.80 --> 5906.98]  Well, that's something that someone made.
[5906.98 --> 5908.58]  Why not just fold it in half?
[5909.54 --> 5910.40]  I mean, it's a concept.
[5910.54 --> 5913.38]  These are concepts and like concept cars,
[5913.52 --> 5915.56]  they're going to include things that
[5915.56 --> 5917.48]  don't make it to market.
[5918.12 --> 5920.30]  And that's the things we looked at.
[5920.46 --> 5921.08]  That's all of them.
[5922.00 --> 5922.30]  Cool.
[5923.12 --> 5923.60]  Nice.
[5923.60 --> 5925.92]  Last week, TechRadar said,
[5928.76 --> 5931.06]  built, or published an article titled,
[5931.30 --> 5932.42]  built versus bought.
[5932.74 --> 5937.10]  Why prebuilt systems are always superior to custom gaming PCs.
[5937.80 --> 5941.58]  It starts by giving some background on Zach as someone who loves to build rigs and even
[5941.58 --> 5946.80]  encourages people to keep building them before immediately 180ing and saying the following.
[5946.80 --> 5952.60]  The honest truth is that unless you're an IT god who spent years pruning over every little
[5952.60 --> 5956.30]  detail of system building with intimate knowledge of all the latest and greatest hardware and
[5956.30 --> 5961.84]  its caveats, you're just not going to be able to compete with a consummate professional whose
[5961.84 --> 5964.18]  day job it is, is to build gaming PCs.
[5964.84 --> 5969.16]  It's like comparing your dad's famous chili con carne recipe to Gordon Ramsay's.
[5969.16 --> 5974.80]  The article does highlight some real issues from building your own PC, such as that it can be
[5974.80 --> 5978.36]  tough to get stock of the latest and greatest if that's what you're after, especially because
[5978.36 --> 5982.74]  SIs can often have deals that guarantee them better stock on those parts, although as we
[5982.74 --> 5983.88]  discussed earlier, not always.
[5984.48 --> 5990.62]  It also talks about QC from system integrators, which, yes, can be a big advantage to making
[5990.62 --> 5992.84]  sure that your computer arrives in working conditions.
[5993.42 --> 5997.32]  But if you've ever seen our Secret Shopper series, you'll know that QC can miss things,
[5997.32 --> 6001.90]  including things that Zach highlights that you won't have to worry about, like BIOS updates,
[6002.02 --> 6003.58]  cable management, cooling, and overclocking.
[6004.28 --> 6007.30]  There is one more comparison at the end of the article, and I quote,
[6007.82 --> 6009.32]  It's like your car, right?
[6010.06 --> 6013.62]  You're always going to get the folk who go around and build their own, tweak the ones they've got,
[6013.72 --> 6016.70]  and get ridiculous horsepower out of an engine in ways that shouldn't be possible,
[6017.10 --> 6021.36]  usually for some ridiculous investment of time or some of money along the way.
[6021.68 --> 6025.84]  Or, alternatively, you could save the drama and just buy a 400 horsepower EV or whatever your
[6025.84 --> 6030.06]  engine of choices, straight off the shop floor with few issues of any, and do 100 miles per
[6030.06 --> 6031.14]  hour in less than five seconds.
[6031.88 --> 6032.38]  End quote.
[6033.90 --> 6037.78]  Elijah puts in here, I found this quote funny, because Jake T and I looked, and there's no
[6037.78 --> 6040.32]  such thing as a 400 horsepower EV that can do that.
[6043.54 --> 6049.48]  Our discussion question here is, as easy as it is to see the headline and possibly get upset,
[6049.48 --> 6054.24]  can you think of any other reasons that pre-builds are better?
[6056.48 --> 6060.10]  I would say the main one for me comes down to support after the fact.
[6060.36 --> 6063.86]  Like, if their support sucks, then I see no reason to buy a pre-built whatsoever,
[6063.86 --> 6068.32]  but if their support is good or offers types of support that you need,
[6068.40 --> 6071.22]  like if you're buying it as a business and you need on-site service,
[6071.48 --> 6074.54]  you know, I could see a pre-built making sense for that.
[6074.54 --> 6078.04]  Otherwise, I don't know, man.
[6078.12 --> 6083.88]  I do think things can be very confusing, and we do rail against sort of the misleading
[6083.88 --> 6091.04]  naming schemes that manufacturers use and the way that specs get obfuscated more and
[6091.04 --> 6091.58]  more and more.
[6091.58 --> 6092.44]  It's not like that doesn't happen with pre-builds.
[6093.14 --> 6097.74]  But yeah, that's the thing is, I think, I don't see the difference between talking to
[6097.74 --> 6104.16]  an SI and asking them to advise me on buying a pre-built PC or talking to a sales rep at
[6104.16 --> 6106.92]  a computer parts store and asking them to advise me on building a computer.
[6106.92 --> 6116.92]  And honestly, I think comparing, you know, someone who builds computers to Gordon Ramsay
[6116.92 --> 6120.52]  is like kind of ridiculous.
[6121.54 --> 6122.06]  Yeah.
[6122.06 --> 6127.70]  Maybe you're comparing it to like the Gordon Ramsay restaurant in the airport.
[6131.88 --> 6136.20]  Building computers, like it's not as easy as some people make it out to be if you have
[6136.20 --> 6140.78]  never done it or you don't do it on the regular, but it isn't rocket science.
[6140.78 --> 6146.42]  And I've gotten the kick out of like SIs over the years that will introduce their like
[6146.42 --> 6153.88]  their system builders as like PC engineers or like system system building engineers or
[6153.88 --> 6154.08]  whatever.
[6154.22 --> 6156.50]  Like here in Canada, engineer is a protected term.
[6156.60 --> 6162.20]  You actually have to like have an education up to a standard to call yourself an engineer.
[6162.34 --> 6165.16]  But in other places, it's not necessarily the case.
[6165.16 --> 6171.04]  And there is nothing engineer about configuring a computer and putting it together.
[6171.04 --> 6172.16]  That's not engineering.
[6174.88 --> 6178.38]  So, yeah, it can be a little bit challenging when you're just getting your feet wet.
[6178.50 --> 6181.44]  But no, I don't think I can agree with this headline.
[6181.70 --> 6183.82]  And I, yeah, it's not engineering.
[6184.28 --> 6188.16]  I think it's time for us to move on to after dark because I have a place that I need to be
[6188.16 --> 6190.36]  that I kind of let get away from me.
[6190.36 --> 6191.16]  I think you have about seven minutes.
[6191.22 --> 6191.70]  Time wise.
[6191.82 --> 6195.66]  So what do we got in the curated birch messages?
[6196.42 --> 6198.10]  Oh, Dan didn't curate too many this week.
[6198.38 --> 6198.44]  So.
[6199.68 --> 6200.28]  Let's go.
[6200.28 --> 6200.98]  Good work.
[6201.90 --> 6204.42]  Yeah, we had a lighter week than last week.
[6204.52 --> 6205.92]  I'll put it that way.
[6206.32 --> 6209.04]  Although I think every week is light compared to last week.
[6212.46 --> 6214.42]  All right, I have to do the magenta.
[6216.44 --> 6216.96]  Let's see.
[6217.02 --> 6217.44]  What do we got?
[6217.52 --> 6217.94]  What do we got?
[6219.40 --> 6220.48]  To Linus.
[6221.14 --> 6225.30]  What's the deal with not reviewing 12 gig cards on 4K?
[6225.72 --> 6231.02]  Developers should be able to add uncompressed textures without meaning 12 gigs is not an
[6231.02 --> 6231.82]  enough for 4K.
[6231.98 --> 6233.68]  I play it 12 gigs and it looks great.
[6241.40 --> 6242.32]  I can't hear.
[6242.48 --> 6242.84]  I can't hear.
[6242.84 --> 6243.22]  He's muted.
[6243.46 --> 6243.74]  He's muted.
[6243.74 --> 6248.12]  We discussed this in our 9070 and 9070 XT review.
[6248.12 --> 6250.28]  And I forget what the game was.
[6250.28 --> 6252.18]  Was it last of us or.
[6253.58 --> 6254.06]  Crud.
[6254.18 --> 6255.06]  I really don't remember.
[6255.06 --> 6270.08]  But basically we highlighted some lag spikes that we were getting on the RTX 5070, the 12 gig card that were not present on any of our 16 gig cards.
[6270.08 --> 6274.96]  Regardless of how much raw horsepower they had.
[6274.96 --> 6280.26]  And so for us, the fact that that's a problem right now.
[6281.34 --> 6281.98]  Today.
[6285.34 --> 6296.34]  Indicates to us that these cards are not in the midterm even going to be suitable for 4K AAA gaming.
[6296.34 --> 6301.50]  And you know, if we're talking about running League of Legends at 4K or whatever, then yeah, sure.
[6301.50 --> 6307.28]  But was it really a question if you're buying a 12 gig card, if League of Legends was going to run?
[6307.42 --> 6308.18]  Probably not.
[6308.76 --> 6316.62]  So, you know, for us, the point of a review is not necessarily to show you exactly what FPS every game under the sun will run at.
[6316.68 --> 6318.26]  That's not what we're trying to achieve.
[6318.26 --> 6329.82]  What we're trying to achieve is to contextualize the relative performance of these cards and their relative price so you can make an informed decision.
[6330.62 --> 6331.94]  It's not the be all and end all.
[6332.16 --> 6338.72]  If you want to know how that card runs in an exact game, there's lots of channels out there that will upload like gameplay footage with FPS counters.
[6339.02 --> 6342.14]  Or there's lots of other reviewers out there that will have a different test suite.
[6342.32 --> 6345.06]  And you should absolutely go out and seek out those additional resources.
[6345.06 --> 6350.34]  We're just trying to give you the thousand foot view of how these cards compete with each other.
[6350.44 --> 6357.18]  And in general, no, I don't think that moving forward, we can recommend 12 gig cards for 4K gaming.
[6359.12 --> 6359.92]  Hi, guys.
[6360.08 --> 6362.90]  Wondering what your favorite tape to tape characters and perks are.
[6363.04 --> 6363.98]  I'm hooked on the game.
[6364.82 --> 6371.30]  Oh, I had, oh, dude, I had one run that I was using Gawain Goretzki.
[6371.30 --> 6378.60]  Who is, yeah, he's this knight character that levels up as you make your way through the different bosses.
[6379.34 --> 6386.48]  And we basically put every perk on him so that as he got bigger and slower, he was still fast.
[6386.72 --> 6388.36]  And he was, were you in that run, Luke?
[6389.10 --> 6389.76]  Yeah, you were.
[6389.84 --> 6393.04]  He was comically tanky.
[6393.04 --> 6399.02]  And then he also has the headshot redirect ability, which is by far the most broken ability in the game.
[6399.38 --> 6407.52]  Because you just, you slap shot to one of your allies and they just like header, like in soccer, they header the puck into the net.
[6407.92 --> 6411.92]  And so you can just be racing up the wing, have one of your allies go up the other wing.
[6412.44 --> 6413.98]  He was completely tanky.
[6414.06 --> 6415.12]  No one could even touch him.
[6415.20 --> 6418.30]  We had the body check while skating with the puck ability.
[6418.30 --> 6420.18]  And I think we had the body armor on him.
[6420.26 --> 6423.70]  So if anyone even tried to check him, they would get knocked over.
[6423.96 --> 6427.70]  So I could just basically charge up the ice, whack it off of Luke's head.
[6427.92 --> 6428.36]  What did we get?
[6428.42 --> 6430.84]  Like 20 goals on the final boss?
[6430.88 --> 6432.88]  We got 12 goals in the first period.
[6433.26 --> 6433.52]  Yeah.
[6433.52 --> 6434.48]  On the final boss.
[6434.84 --> 6435.76]  Yeah, it was not even close.
[6435.78 --> 6436.26]  We ended with over 20.
[6436.70 --> 6436.92]  Yeah.
[6437.00 --> 6437.96]  It was not even close.
[6439.20 --> 6442.94]  That's the most broken run that we've done so far, I think.
[6443.40 --> 6444.18]  Yeah, yeah.
[6444.18 --> 6448.76]  I have a super broken run that I'm in the middle of right now and I'm not finishing it on my own.
[6448.82 --> 6450.00]  I'm just on the first world.
[6450.24 --> 6452.52]  But dude, it is completely broken.
[6452.66 --> 6456.24]  I have fossilized star for plus 20 speed on all my bench warmers.
[6456.38 --> 6459.42]  I got growth serum, growth serum.
[6459.66 --> 6460.66]  So everyone's big.
[6461.20 --> 6463.22]  And I got like a couple other things.
[6463.28 --> 6466.02]  Basically, my bench warmers all have superstar stats.
[6467.24 --> 6469.04]  It's the team is cracked.
[6469.42 --> 6470.92]  It's going to be it's going to be a great run.
[6470.92 --> 6473.90]  So I was going to wait till some humans can come and help me finish it.
[6474.18 --> 6476.48]  Because I think it's a record breaking run.
[6477.22 --> 6477.70]  Nice.
[6478.76 --> 6481.86]  I really like researching PC parts and building PCs.
[6482.06 --> 6485.36]  So I take every opportunity to build a PC for a family member.
[6485.92 --> 6488.38]  Linus, do you still enjoy building PCs for yourself?
[6489.58 --> 6493.08]  I enjoy it as long as I'm doing something different.
[6493.48 --> 6496.10]  I don't really like doing the same thing over and over again.
[6497.34 --> 6497.82]  Nice.
[6497.82 --> 6509.68]  So probably I think I probably had the most fun building a PC than I've had in definitely weeks, probably months.
[6510.20 --> 6513.34]  Working on the machine that's on the other side of that wall over there.
[6513.46 --> 6515.00]  I'm so excited for that video.
[6515.20 --> 6515.70]  Oh, dude.
[6515.86 --> 6517.00]  Oh, yeah.
[6517.54 --> 6517.84]  Yeah.
[6517.84 --> 6519.54]  It's very different.
[6519.78 --> 6520.96]  From what was there?
[6521.04 --> 6522.48]  Anything that we've done in a while.
[6522.74 --> 6525.66]  I don't know if it's practical, but it's so cool.
[6525.80 --> 6530.34]  It's a Kickstarter project that took eight years to finally be delivered.
[6530.74 --> 6532.54]  And we got one.
[6532.72 --> 6536.74]  It looks absolutely nothing like what they promised in their original Kickstarter.
[6536.74 --> 6539.28]  It is so much better.
[6539.52 --> 6540.32]  So sick.
[6540.46 --> 6541.26]  I'm so excited.
[6541.82 --> 6542.52]  I'm so excited.
[6542.94 --> 6544.10]  And yeah, I had a blast.
[6544.22 --> 6547.32]  Alex and I built it together and it was so much fun.
[6547.50 --> 6557.06]  And so, yeah, I love, I still love building PCs, but I don't really, I don't really love just like, you know, upgrading my motherboard.
[6558.54 --> 6561.18]  Like I kind of get locked into like troubleshooting.
[6561.38 --> 6564.16]  I would say I still maybe enjoy more than just like building a PC.
[6564.64 --> 6565.52]  I like problem solving.
[6565.52 --> 6565.60]  Free dopamine.
[6566.02 --> 6566.64]  Free dopamine.
[6566.74 --> 6567.74]  Free dopamine.
[6568.50 --> 6569.44]  Hello, LLD.
[6569.68 --> 6570.50]  A question for Luke.
[6570.62 --> 6572.12]  It looks like he's leaving, so maybe not.
[6572.72 --> 6573.20]  No, no, no.
[6573.20 --> 6573.50]  I'm here.
[6573.66 --> 6573.90]  Okay.
[6574.54 --> 6577.04]  Where is a place you want to check out that you've never been to?
[6577.16 --> 6579.36]  We live in Flathead Valley in Montana.
[6579.56 --> 6580.50]  Please come check us out.
[6582.46 --> 6583.30]  Flathead Valley.
[6583.88 --> 6589.42]  Isn't Montana what they call a wonderful state that everyone visits?
[6591.26 --> 6595.34]  Is a region known for its stunning natural beauty.
[6595.34 --> 6596.34]  Wow.
[6596.34 --> 6596.86]  Wow.
[6597.10 --> 6598.56]  These pictures look amazing.
[6598.56 --> 6599.56]  This place looks amazing.
[6599.56 --> 6600.28]  This place looks amazing.
[6600.28 --> 6601.32]  Look at this.
[6601.32 --> 6604.32]  Oh my goodness.
[6604.32 --> 6607.74]  I was like, why is there a picture of Dan in my Google image results?
[6608.26 --> 6609.56]  And then I moved it.
[6610.06 --> 6612.46]  Look at the third picture in the results.
[6612.46 --> 6615.34]  This is incredible.
[6615.34 --> 6615.96]  What a shot, man.
[6617.84 --> 6620.72]  Steve J3D says, Montana is our Canada.
[6621.30 --> 6621.60]  Yeah.
[6621.68 --> 6621.98]  Okay.
[6622.10 --> 6622.88]  That checks out.
[6623.48 --> 6624.30]  That's gorgeous.
[6624.56 --> 6625.50]  It looks like I would like it there.
[6625.88 --> 6626.96]  That's gorgeous.
[6626.96 --> 6635.24]  I don't actually, I don't have any North American travel booked over the next little bit here.
[6637.72 --> 6641.50]  So we'll see how, we'll see, we'll see, but it looks beautiful.
[6641.96 --> 6642.92]  It looks really beautiful.
[6643.06 --> 6644.26]  I've never been to Banff.
[6644.32 --> 6645.50]  I'd really like to go to Banff.
[6645.50 --> 6649.14]  That'd be pretty sweet.
[6649.84 --> 6651.52]  There's a bunch of Asian countries in Arvintu.
[6651.60 --> 6652.40]  That would be awesome.
[6654.34 --> 6659.44]  I was in Iceland for like a very extended layover.
[6659.68 --> 6661.88]  I would like to actually go there for real.
[6661.88 --> 6671.50]  I also want to go to like some less common destination countries though.
[6671.66 --> 6672.88]  Like I'd like to go to Greenland.
[6673.00 --> 6675.56]  I'd like to go to some like, yeah.
[6675.74 --> 6676.36]  You mean America?
[6676.62 --> 6677.02]  Less common areas.
[6678.02 --> 6678.36]  Oh.
[6679.68 --> 6681.26]  If it becomes that, maybe not.
[6681.42 --> 6682.46]  Oz is on my list.
[6683.04 --> 6684.28]  I really, really.
[6684.28 --> 6684.54]  Yeah, that would be sick.
[6684.62 --> 6685.08]  Never been there.
[6685.14 --> 6685.92]  Need to go to Oz.
[6686.98 --> 6687.18]  Yeah.
[6687.44 --> 6689.06]  I want to go scuba diving in Australia.
[6689.06 --> 6691.38]  That's the next thing I actually want to do.
[6692.88 --> 6694.16]  That's a sad thing to hear.
[6695.04 --> 6696.32]  Yeah, I'm just saying though.
[6697.86 --> 6698.48]  Last one.
[6698.66 --> 6698.90]  It means Oz.
[6699.58 --> 6699.86]  Yeah.
[6700.54 --> 6701.28]  Last one I got for you.
[6701.28 --> 6702.52]  I thought people call it Oz, don't they?
[6702.88 --> 6703.54]  Yeah, don't they?
[6703.72 --> 6704.24]  That's a thing.
[6704.26 --> 6705.60]  Some people in the comments were confused.
[6705.60 --> 6705.72]  Oh.
[6705.86 --> 6705.96]  Yeah.
[6706.36 --> 6707.28]  You're not wrong.
[6707.34 --> 6707.94]  I mean Australia.
[6708.92 --> 6709.26]  Yeah, yeah.
[6709.52 --> 6709.78]  Yes.
[6711.02 --> 6711.64]  Last one.
[6711.84 --> 6712.52]  Hey, LLD.
[6713.00 --> 6716.24]  Linus, you've noted you're a fan of Final Fantasy Tactics.
[6716.54 --> 6719.26]  Have you tried any of the mods or total conversions for the game?
[6719.26 --> 6722.66]  I'd recommend Final Fantasy Tactics 1.3.
[6722.98 --> 6723.82]  Thanks for all the cool vids.
[6725.54 --> 6726.52]  Did I try one?
[6726.68 --> 6730.10]  No, I tried a Final Fantasy VI mod that I really enjoyed.
[6730.68 --> 6733.10]  That I actually think you might have enjoyed better than the Pixel Remaster.
[6733.36 --> 6735.34]  I'm honestly, I'm kind of over the Pixel Remaster.
[6736.96 --> 6737.64]  No, but I...
[6737.64 --> 6737.96]  I did burn on it.
[6737.98 --> 6741.82]  I played it a little bit more too, but like I was really into it when I first got into
[6741.82 --> 6744.60]  the game and it feels like it tapers off pretty hard.
[6744.60 --> 6746.78]  Would you like me to explain why?
[6747.76 --> 6748.14]  Yes.
[6748.64 --> 6749.04]  Yeah.
[6749.26 --> 6752.84]  The game was supposed to end on the floating continent.
[6755.40 --> 6759.86]  And then they like realized that they had more room on the cart.
[6760.08 --> 6760.94]  This is what I've heard.
[6761.12 --> 6761.86]  This is what I've heard.
[6762.22 --> 6768.96]  They like realized that they had more room on the cart and that they like had more time
[6768.96 --> 6774.00]  and budget and they like made another like half of the game.
[6774.76 --> 6778.80]  That honestly makes a lot of sense because it feels like there's a pretty notable quality
[6778.80 --> 6780.22]  shift right around that time.
[6780.82 --> 6784.10]  Because I was like genuinely like really into it for a while.
[6785.30 --> 6789.94]  And then it's just, it feels like it's kind of over and I'm at that point.
[6790.04 --> 6791.88]  So at this point, it's a little bit of a slog.
[6791.96 --> 6794.26]  I'll finish it, but it's a little bit of a slog.
[6794.26 --> 6798.38]  But yeah, the first, let's call it first half because I didn't know how far I know
[6798.38 --> 6798.72]  it was in.
[6798.72 --> 6799.30]  The World of Balance.
[6800.20 --> 6801.28]  Let's call it the first half.
[6801.30 --> 6802.54]  The World of Balance is what it's called.
[6803.42 --> 6804.32]  Was fantastic.
[6804.54 --> 6804.86]  It is.
[6805.10 --> 6805.72]  Super good.
[6805.96 --> 6806.68]  Super, super good.
[6806.82 --> 6810.92]  Like worth just playing that even, even if you're not going to play the whole thing.
[6810.98 --> 6811.10]  Yeah.
[6811.10 --> 6814.64]  You can just pretend the game ends there and honestly you get, you get most of it.
[6815.40 --> 6815.56]  Yeah.
[6816.70 --> 6817.06]  Yeah.
[6817.06 --> 6821.60]  I should probably try a total conversion for Final Fantasy Tactics or like a cool mod.
[6821.60 --> 6825.96]  Man, I feel like I, I feel like I did try a mod at some point.
[6827.34 --> 6832.10]  Like this, it rings such a bell for me.
[6834.16 --> 6835.24]  Thank you for that.
[6836.24 --> 6842.66]  It was so fast.
[6843.78 --> 6846.98]  I missed one at the front so now I'm like jumping at it.
[6846.98 --> 6852.74]  For me at this point though, I think a big part of what I love about, oh no, I did.
[6852.80 --> 6854.76]  I tried War of the Lions 1.3.
[6854.84 --> 6856.54]  That's like a different mod or something.
[6857.48 --> 6858.30]  Or wait, no.
[6858.70 --> 6860.96]  Original projects, changes in content, unique features.
[6861.28 --> 6861.54]  Okay.
[6861.62 --> 6862.20]  No, I don't know.
[6862.30 --> 6862.56]  I don't know.
[6862.60 --> 6865.58]  I feel like I tried to try something at some point, but maybe I didn't get into it.
[6865.60 --> 6867.18]  But yeah, I'd like to try something.
[6867.32 --> 6872.30]  But for me, going back to Final Fantasy Tactics, a big part of it is honestly just the familiarity
[6872.30 --> 6872.98]  at this point.
[6873.10 --> 6879.94]  Like I, if I was gonna dive into a new game, there's so many other games that I feel like
[6879.94 --> 6881.00]  I should play first.
[6881.16 --> 6887.16]  Like what's that other, what's that tactics series that got so many games and is supposed
[6887.16 --> 6887.98]  to be so good?
[6890.00 --> 6891.52]  Oh no, it's for PC.
[6893.00 --> 6895.22]  Games like, games like this.
[6895.32 --> 6897.00]  Oh no, this is terrible.
[6897.46 --> 6898.12]  I feel so bad.
[6898.18 --> 6899.34]  I think it's a Western game.
[6899.34 --> 6900.72]  Someone help me.
[6900.80 --> 6901.68]  No, not Fire Emblem.
[6902.46 --> 6902.78]  XCOM.
[6902.96 --> 6903.38]  That's the one.
[6903.52 --> 6903.66]  Yeah.
[6903.74 --> 6905.28]  Like I've never played an XCOM game.
[6906.42 --> 6911.94]  Like how can I say I'm a fan of the genre if I've never played an XCOM game?
[6912.00 --> 6912.82]  Like that's ridiculous.
[6913.26 --> 6917.06]  So if I'm going to jump into a new game, I should probably like play something I've never
[6917.06 --> 6918.32]  played before rather than a mod.
[6920.08 --> 6920.44]  Yeah.
[6920.46 --> 6921.56]  People like it's different, but it's good.
[6921.62 --> 6922.26]  Yeah, exactly.
[6923.14 --> 6923.46]  Exactly.
[6926.66 --> 6927.36]  XCOM is fun.
[6927.36 --> 6930.18]  99% is a miss is real with that series.
[6930.30 --> 6934.78]  I mean, yeah, you're going to get that with any kind of tactics game and it's always at
[6934.78 --> 6936.14]  the worst possible moment.
[6936.24 --> 6942.30]  That's why, dude, anytime an ability is like hit super hard, but low percentage, I'm like,
[6942.74 --> 6943.16]  fuck it.
[6943.20 --> 6944.06]  You're on the bench.
[6944.46 --> 6946.64]  You are seeing zero combat.
[6946.84 --> 6950.36]  I literally will not take anything that is not a guaranteed hit.
[6950.68 --> 6955.10]  Like I think my first couple playthroughs of Final Fantasy Tactics, I didn't even figure
[6955.10 --> 6959.96]  out that the archer like has evolutions because I literally just never used them because they
[6959.96 --> 6960.74]  missed so much.
[6960.80 --> 6961.82]  I was like, forget it.
[6961.86 --> 6962.24]  You're done.
[6962.32 --> 6962.82]  You're out.
[6964.02 --> 6964.66]  Enemy Unknown.
[6964.82 --> 6965.60]  I loved Enemy Unknown.
[6965.80 --> 6969.16]  I played it on, I think it's called Iron Man where there's like permadeath and you,
[6969.26 --> 6970.56]  you only have one save.
[6970.62 --> 6972.00]  Like you can't go back ever.
[6972.00 --> 6975.48]  And I got to the very end of the game.
[6975.90 --> 6981.32]  And if I remember correctly, it's like I had beat the actually challenging part.
[6981.44 --> 6984.26]  I just needed to go into like one more room and the game was just going to end.
[6985.16 --> 6987.72]  But it glitched and I couldn't get through the wall.
[6987.92 --> 6990.76]  So I had like beat the game, but I couldn't see the ending.
[6990.90 --> 6993.64]  So I had beat the game, but had to like YouTube the ending.
[6994.86 --> 6996.40]  It was so disappointing.
[6996.40 --> 7005.10]  I YouTubed the ending of Fantasian and I still feel icky about it, but the final boss was
[7005.10 --> 7007.02]  just so tedious and such a slog.
[7007.14 --> 7011.96]  Like I made it through the first stage of it and then I Googled it and apparently there's
[7011.96 --> 7016.00]  two more like evolutions of the final boss.
[7016.08 --> 7017.36]  And I'm just like, forget this.
[7017.92 --> 7018.56]  Forget this.
[7018.62 --> 7018.86]  I'm done.
[7019.00 --> 7019.62]  That's good enough.
[7019.74 --> 7020.64]  Speaking of forget this.
[7020.76 --> 7021.46]  Do you need to go?
[7021.74 --> 7022.08]  I do.
[7022.34 --> 7023.52]  So I'll see you again next week.
[7023.84 --> 7024.38]  Same bad time.
[7024.44 --> 7024.96]  Same bad channel.
[7026.00 --> 7026.36]  Bye.
[7026.40 --> 7026.60]  Bye.
